ABSTRACT

We present the results of an optical photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy cam-
paign for a modest sample of X-ray selected stars in the Chamaeleon and Rho Ophiuchus star
forming regions. With R∼50000 optical spectra, we establish kinematic membership of the
parent association and conﬁrm stellar youth for each star in our sample. With the acquisition
of new standardized BV Ic photometry, in concert with near-infrared data from the literature,
we derive age and mass from stellar positions in model-dependent Hertzsprung-Russell dia-
grams. We compare isochronal ages derived using colour-dependent extinction values ﬁnding
that, within error bars, ages are the same irrespective of whether E(B − V ), E(V − Ic),
E(J − H) or E(H − K) is used to establish extinction, although model ages tend to be
marginally younger for redder Ecolour values. For Cham I and η Cham members we derive
ages of ∼<5-6 Myr, whereas our three η Cha candidates are more consistent with a ∼>25 Myr
post-T Tauri star population. In Rho Ophiuchus, most stars in our sample have isochronal
ages <10 Myr. Five objects show evidence of strong infrared excess (Av > 5) in the 2MASS
colour-colour diagram, however in terms of H α emission, all stars except RXJ1625.6-2613
are consistent with being weak-lined T-Tauri stars. Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over
the range ≃ 4000Å < λ < 1000µm, show that only one Chamaeleon star (RXJ1112.7-7637)
and three Rho Ophiuchus stars (ROXR1 13, RXJ1625.6-2613 & RXJ1627.1-2419) reveal
substantial departures from a bare photosphere.

Key words: stars: circumstellar matter, stars: fundamental parameters, stars: evolution, stars:
Hertzsprung-Russell and colour-magnitude diagrams, stars: pre-main-sequence, stars: late-
type.

1 INTRODUCTION

Star forming regions (SFRs) and young star clusters seed a vari-
ety of empirical and theoretical investigations into the fundamental
physical processes governing how stars form and evolve. Exem-
plar domains of study include proto-stellar formation and evolution
(Bate 1998; Wuchterl & Tscharnuter 2003), circumstellar disc dy-
namics (Haisch, Lada & Lada 2001 ; Bate 2011), extra-solar planet
formation (e.g. Pollack et al. 1996; Tsukamto et al. 2013) , and

exoplanet orbital mechanics (Trilling et al. 1998; Armitage 2003;
Nelson & Benz 2003a,b). Observational efforts, through optical and
infrared photometric and spectroscopic surveys, are required to un-
derstand such processes and generally necessitate a large sample
of conﬁrmed members of parent SFRs or young clusters with well-
constrained fundamental stellar parameters.

Young stellar objects (YSOs) fall into four main classes gen-
erally denoted 0−III, representing an evolutionary sequence from
protostar shrouded by natal molecular cloud material through to a
discless system possibly hosting an evolved planetary system. Em-
bedded class 0−I objects Lada 1987, André et al. 1993) transition
to class II when the surrounding envelope has cleared. Class II ob-
jects correspond with classical T Tauri stars (CTTS), deﬁned by

their enhanced infrared (disc) emission, excess blue emission from
accretion luminosity, and numerous spectral features in emission;
further, broad and complex line morphologies are observed which
are due to circumstellar material. Class III YSOs show little or no
near-infrared excess, and correspond to weak-lined T-Tauri stars
(WTTS), which also exhibit little spectral line emission above ex-
pected chromospheric activity levels, consistent with the cessation
of circumstellar disc accretion as the inner disc has been depleted.
More remains unknown than known concerning the evolution
of circumstellar discs; in particular the mechanisms most respon-
sible for driving accretion (i.e. outward angular momentum trans-
port) and dissipation in Class I and II systems. Circumstellar discs
are also important testbeds for theories of planet formation and mi-
gration. Near-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of so-
called transition discs (Forest et al. 2004) have long been thought
to reveal the presence of gaps cleared by massive planets, as in
type II planet migration (e.g. Nelson & Benz 2003a,b). This has
been conﬁrmed in several cases via direct imaging and interfer-
ometry (e.g. Skemer et al. 2014; Brogan et al. 2015). Nearby sys-
tems showing excess infrared emission consistent with the pres-
ence of a disc therefore make logical targets for followup imaging
to probe disc structure, search for signs of protoplanet–disc inter-
actions, and possibly direct detection of embedded protoplanets.
Measuring stellar ages will therefore be key in observationally con-
straining planet formation timescales.

Circumstellar disc evolution, especially with regard to planet
formation and migration, is a high priority science driver of the
current and next-generation optical, infrared and sub-mm obser-
vatories such as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS),
the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and
the James Webb Space Telescope (e.g. Wolf et al. 2012; Flock et al.
2015; Cowan et al. 2015). Given that the relatively bright stars, in
nearby SFRs such as Chamaeleon and Rho Ophiuchus1, are most
likely to be included in the TESS mission input catalogue, it is vi-
tally important to fully characterize the fundamental physical prop-
erties of their solar-type members. Broadly speaking, complete
membership catalogues and well-constrained stellar parameters –
especially mass and age – in coeval SFRs and clusters are essential
for understanding the time evolution of fundamental physics which
govern disc evolution, and thus planet formation and evolution.

In this manuscript, we detail a photometric and spectroscopic
campaign of X-ray selected candidate members of the Chamaeleon
and Rho Ophiuchus associations, exploiting the dataset to charac-
terize their physical properties and evolutionary status. In § 2, we
discuss target selection, telescope observations and data reduction
procedures in producing standardized BV Ic photometry, spectro-
scopic kinematics and spectral line equivalent widths. We present
our results and data catalogues in § 3, using them to conﬁrm mem-
bership, and establish youth, of each star of its parent association.
In concert with 2MASS and WISE near- and mid-infrared photom-
etry, we construct theoretical Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams to in-
fer stellar age and mass for each object in our sample. In § 4, we
detail a programmatic search for the presence of circumstellar ac-
cretion discs of our sample, exploiting optical and infrared photo-
metric data in order to construct SEDs for each candidate member
of Chamaeleon and Rho Ophiuchus. In concluding, we deliver a
discussion and summary of our research program in § 5.

sion

2 TARGET SELECTION AND OBSERVATIONS

Young, low-mass stellar objects are oftentimes associated with
super-solar levels of magnetic activity, which is manifest through
elevated X-ray and radio emission (Feigelson & Montmerle 1999;
James et al. 2000; James et al. 2006; Cargile et al. 2009). For
our study into the properties of both the Chamaeleon and Rho
Ophiuchus SFRs, mirroring the strategy in our earlier studies
(James et al. 2006 - [J06], Santos et al. 2008 - [S08]), we selected
candidate SFR stars within positional error circles of detections
in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey [RASS]. For each candidate WTTS,
physical properties such as proper motions, radial velocities [RVs],
Lithium abundances and near infrared colours are used to ascer-
tain membership of their parent association, details of which are
presented in § 3.1.

In order to investigate the fundamental properties of each SFR
member, speciﬁcally mass and age, we pursued photometric and
spectroscopic observing campaigns in the optical to complement
existing near- and mid-infrared all sky survey photometry now
available in the literature. Observations, data reduction and anal-
ysis for each campaign are discussed below.

2.1 Photometry

BV Ic photometric data for individual ﬁelds containing X-ray se-
lected candidates of Chamaeleon and Rho Ophiuchus were ob-
tained using the 1.0m SMARTS telescope (the former YALO tele-
scope) situated at the Cerro Tololo InterAmerican Observatory
[CTIO], Chile, on the night of UT20070630. The data were ac-
quired with the quad-ampliﬁer Y4KCAM CCD camera, equipped
with Johnson-Cousins ﬁlters, which with its 15 µm pixels and
0.289 arcsec/pixel plate scale results in an on-sky areal coverage of
19.′3 ×19.′3. We note that during the 2007 observing season, one of
the quad-ampliﬁers of Y4KCAM was inoperable in the North-West
corner of the array, resulting in a reduced ﬁeld of view per image.
An observing log of the Chamaeleon and Rho Ophiuchus Y4KCAM
observations is presented in Table A1.

All science and standard star images were processed for over-
scan region subtraction, master-bias subtraction and ﬂat ﬁelding,
using twilight sky images, employing standard procedures in the
IRAF2 suite of data reduction algorithms. Substantial use was also
made of two batch processing IRAF scripts, written by Phil Massey
of Lowell Observatory, whose protocol speciﬁcally handles the
FITS headers and quad-ampliﬁer readout of the Y4KCAM CCD
frames. The low space density of the SFRs allows us to employ
aperture photometry for science images as well as the standard star
ﬁeld images. Source searching and aperture photometry, with an
aperture radius of 13-pixels, were achieved using the DAOPHOT II
package in IRAF (Stetson et al. 1990; Stetson 1993).

Equatorial BV Ic standard stars catalogued in Landolt (1992),
with a broad dynamic range of photometric magnitude and colour,
and located at a wide distribution of airmass, were observed in or-
der to correct for atmospheric extinction and to transform extinc-
tion corrected, instrumental magnitudes onto the standard system.
Modiﬁed forms of Bouguer’s law, see Eqs. 1−4, were used to de-

tudes/indices.

• κv, κbv and κvi are wavelength (ﬁlter) dependent extinction

coefﬁcients.

• ε, φ, µ and ψ are colour transformation coefﬁcients.
• ξv, ξbv and ξvi are zero-point coefﬁcients.
• X = airmass of target [≃ sec z - where z is the zenith distance]

Unknown extinction coefﬁcients, colour transformation co-
efﬁcients and zeropoints were determined by solving the self-
similar series of linear simultaneous algebraic equations detailed
in Eqs. 1−4. For the ensemble of standard star observations, solu-
tions were derived using a least-squares ﬁt algorithm3 which pro-
cesses the numeric parameters via an iterative reﬁnement method.
Comparing calculated magnitudes and colours of Landolt standard
stars to their published values allows an iterative rejection process
to take place, thereby eliminating seriously discrepant standard star
measurements. Standard star measurements were eliminated from
the ﬁt if the difference between their calculated and published mag-
nitudes were ∼>3σ away from equality, with a ﬁnal solution being
accepted if the RMS of these differences was ∼<0.02 magnitudes. In
this way, approximately 70-80 standard stars were observed, with
60-70 stars used in the ﬁnal solution. In order to test whether the
solutions to the colour equations have parameter dependencies on
magnitude, colour, airmass or time of observation, we compared
calculated and published values of the observed Landolt standard
star ﬁelds searching for parameter correlations. None were found.
Solutions to the colour equations are listed in Table 1. Tar-
get star photometry is easily determined by substituting the de-
rived extinction, transformation and zero-point coefﬁcients, and
measured instrumental magnitudes into Eqs. 1−4. Comparing our
colour equation coefﬁcients to similar data acquired with the exact
same instrument set up (c.f., Cargile & James 2010), we ﬁnd that
our colour transformation coefﬁcients agree to within ≃ 1 − 2 per
cent of the Cargile & James values, except for the B-V one, where
the difference is of order 5 per cent. Judging the similarity of extinc-
tion coefﬁcients and zero-points is very difﬁcult because of the way
we solve the colour equations, calculating all three coefﬁcients si-
multaneously, allowing the least-squares solution to see-saw about
the colour-transformation coefﬁcient as a fulcrum. What we can
say is that comparing our coefﬁcient values in Table 1 with those

in table 2 of the Cargile & James paper shows that there are no
obviously deviant coefﬁcient data points. In any case, we are able
to reproduce the colours and magnitudes of Landolt standard stars
throughout the UT20070630 night to the ≃ 1 − 2 per cent level
(e.g., see RMS delta-magnitudes in both studies).

Initial stellar coordinates (RA, DEC) were calculated using
6-coefﬁcient ﬁts to CCD X,Y values using Digitized Sky Survey
[DSS] red plates; Object matches were subsequently made with
2MASS catalogues, using a 2-arcsec matching radius, and we em-
ploy these 2MASS J2000 sexagesimal coordinates for each SFR can-
didate member (columns 4-5 in table A1).

2.2 Spectroscopy

With the express goals of deriving radial velocities and detection
of the resonance doublet of neutral Lithium at 6708Å, facilitating
SFR kinematic membership and youth assessments, we have ob-
tained high-resolution échelle spectra of our SFR candidate mem-
bers in Chamaeleon and Rho Ophiuchus. The high resolution (R ≡
λ/∆λ ∼50000) spectra were acquired in service mode with the
UVES spectrograph on the Kueyan 8.2-m telescope located at the
Paranal site of the European Southern Observatory (programme ID
075.C-0272). The observations were made using the Red 580 mode
of cross disperser #3, with a spectral window of 4800−7000Å
(with a small gap between 5700−5840Å), using the SHP700 ﬁlter,
employing a 0.9-arcsec slit and 2×2 binning of the MIT/LL EEV
detector (CCD-44). An observing log of the Chamaeleon and Rho
Ophiuchus UVES observations is presented in Table A2.

Data reduction in the form of removal of instrumental ef-
fects (de-biasing, ﬂat-ﬁelding), spectral extraction and wavelength
calibration (using corresponding ThAr lamp spectra) of the UVES
spectra was performed using the instrument’s dedicated reduction
pipelines. Heliocentric radial velocities [RVs] were calculated by
cross-correlation techniques (Tonry & Davis 1979) relative to the
slowly-rotating IAU and GAIA velocity standard star HD 76151
(Nordström et al. 2004; Soubiran et al. 2013) using the spectral
range 5000-5350Å. This spectral window is ideal for RV determi-
nations because it contains many deep metal absorption lines (es-
pecially the Mg I triplet) and little telluric contamination. Cross
correlation of the HD 76151 UVES spectrum against other IAU ve-
locity standards reveal that external errors on the standard system
are ≃ 0.4 km s−1. Random errors were calculated in a similar man-
ner to the J06 study, and vary from 0.2 km s−1 for slowly rotating
stars increasing to ≃2 − 3 km s−1 for more rapidly rotating objects
(∼>20 km s−1).

In order to measure equivalent widths [EW] of the Li I reso-
nance doublet at 6708Å, we ﬁrst normalized target UVES spectra
by division of a ≃ 25th-order cubic spline ﬁt to the data over the
6600-6800 Å spectral window, masking out the Balmer series H
α region from the ﬁt. We employ both the direct integration and
Gaussian ﬁtting methods (e.g. see J06 ), so our EW values encom-
pass contributions from the small Fe I+CN lines at 6707.44Å, lead-
ing to measured Lithium EWs that result in a minorly (10 − 20 mÅ)
overestimated photospheric Li presence (Soderblom et al. 1993 re-
port that this Fe line blend has an empirical EW = [20(B − V )0 -
3]mÅ, for main sequence, solar-type stars). In the case of H α, we
followed the same procedure as J06 in that the normalized spec-
trum of an old, slow rotating, minimum-activity standard star of
similar spectral type was ﬁrst subtracted from the Chamaeleon and
Rho Ophiuchus candidate’s spectrum. This methodology is power-
ful because it takes account of (at least to ﬁrst order) telluric con-
tamination and acts to remove the photospheric contribution to the

H α line. In our case, we used UVES spectra of the slowly rotat-
ing stars HD 76151 (G3V, Prot=15days, Barnes 2007), HD 196761
(G8V, Prot=31days, Wright et al. 2004) and HD 191408 (K2.5V,
Prot=45days, Barnes 2007), whose spectral types were veriﬁed by
cross-correlation against the digital spectral library presented in
James (2013).

Finally, we exploit our UVES spectra in order to calculate
spectroscopic projected equatorial rotation rates, υsini, for our
SFR targets by cross correlation with similar spectra of the min-
imum activity, slowly rotating late-type stars listed above (c.f.,
James & Jeffries 1997). Calibration of the width of the inverse
cross correlation function is achieved by artiﬁcially broadening
(Gray 1992; limb-darkening ﬁxed at 0.6) a high-S/N spectrum of
a given minimum activity star, and cross-correlating it with its un-
broadened original for a series of incremental υsini values. By
measuring the width of the central peaks in the resulting inverse
cross-correlation functions, as a function of rotation rate in the
broadening kernel, a relationship between rotation rate and cross
correlation function width is readily produced. Empirical simula-
tions, similar to those detailed in J06, were performed to show that
UVES υsini values are reproducible at the ±10 per cent level down
to an upper limit of ≃ 4 − 5 km s−1.

3 RESULTS

Optical BV Ic and infrared JHK photometry, from Y4KCAM ob-
servations and 2MASS, respectively, are presented for our candidate
members of the Chamaeleon and Rho Ophiuchus SFRs in Table 2;
accompanying table notes detail data sources for each object. Data
products for our UVES observations are presented in Table 3, which
include spectral types drawn from the literature. Equivalent widths
for the H α and Li I 6708Å spectral lines are provided using both
Gaussian ﬁt and direct integration methods. A representative sam-
ple of normalized UVES spectra, in the 6700Å region, for candidate
members of Rho Ophiuchus is shown in Figure 1.

Each subset of the observational data can be engaged in de-
riving fundamental properties for each candidate SFR member and
of the parent SFR itself. We will investigate ﬁve cornerstone char-
acteristics of the observational data in the following manner. First,
our UVES spectra provide radial velocities and Lithium detections
for each star, which assist us in assigning kinematic membership
of each SFR and in assessing stellar youth. Second, optical and
infrared photometry, in concert with spectral types, allows us to
measure colour-dependent reddening vectors, which contribute to

Figure 1. Normalized (and offset) rest-frame UVES spectra for a sample
of candidate members of the Rho Ophiuchus SFR are shown. Heliocentric
radial velocities and Gaussian-ﬁt Li I 6708Å EWs are annotated for each
star (c.f. Table 3).

our spectral energy distribution analysis of Chamaeleon and Rho
Ophiuchus members suspected of being classical T Tauri stars (see
§ 4). Third, JHK photometry can be exploited to search for ex-
cess infrared emission, indicative of the presence of a circumstellar
accretion disc around young stars, and represents one of the key
demarcation signatures between classical and weak-line T Tauri
stars. Extremely high levels of H α emission can also be indica-
tive of circumstellar material, allowing us to use our UVES spec-
tra to correlate infrared excess with strong H α emission. Fourth,
employing effective temperatures and bolometric corrections (for
bolometric luminosity determinations) derived from spectral types,
facilitating the construction of theoretical Hertzsprung-Russell di-
agrams [HRDs] leading to determinations of stellar mass and age.
Fifth, combining optical and near-to-mid infrared photometry with
radiative transfer models, we construct spectral energy distribu-
tions [SEDs] for each candidate SFR member observed to search
for, and characterize, signature evidence of circumstellar discs and
blueward excesses indicative of ongoing accretion. The following
sections are dedicated to describing each observational dataset in
terms of the fundamental nature of our target stars, culminating in
a commentary for each of these ﬁve investigative avenues.

3.1 Membership of the parent SFR

An understanding of the age-rotation-magnetic activity paradigm
(e.g. Hempelmann et al. 1995, Neuhäuser et al. 1995, Alcalá et al.
1996, J06, Cargile et al. 2009) already implies that these low-mass
SFR candidate members, being optical counterparts to RASS X-ray
detections, are either very young and rapidly rotating, are short-
period multiple stars systems, or are both. Irrespective of whether
each Chamaeleon and Rho Ophiuchus candidate is a classical or
weak-lined T Tauri star, we can assign membership of each star
relevant to their parent associations through a careful consideration
of each one’s astrometric and kinematic properties.

In Figure 2, we display astrometric data for each star in our
sample to ascertain whether our targets are consistent with mem-
bership of any particular young SFR in their vicinity. In the left-
hand plot, we show that all of our targets, as expected and without
exception, fall into the expected regions of (l, b), Galactic coor-
dinate space, for both the Chamaeleon and Rho Ophiuchus SFRs
(based on previous work and examples by Sartori et al. 2003 and
Aarnio et al. 2008).

precise enough, nor unambiguous enough, to provide us with a
deﬁnitive membership indication of their parent association (c.f.
Mamajek 2008, Ducourant et al. 2005). Only one Rho Ophi-
uchus object is a clear proper motion non-member of the SFR,
RXJ1620.1-2348, for which we show in § 3.3 is a probable ﬁeld
star. For the Chamaeleon sample however, a summary of high
quality proper motion vectors are available in the literature (e.g.
López Martí et al. 2013a; López Martí et al. 2013b), which we
plot in the right-hand panel of Figure 2. A comparison to proper
motion vectors of young stars in the vicinity allows us to allocate
sub-group Chamaeleon membership for our targets.

Interestingly, this proper motion vector phase diagram reveals
the following: Three of our Chamaeleon sample, RXJ0850.1-7554,
RXJ0951.9-7901 and RXJ1140.3-8321, have two-dimensional
kinematics broadly consistent with being members of the Eta
Chamaeleon population,
in agreement with the ﬁndings of
López Martí et al. (2013a). On the other hand, Elliott et al. (2014)
assert that RXJ0951.9-7901 and RXJ1140.3-8321 are in fact mem-
bers of the older (30−40 Myr, Kraus et al. 2014; 45 Myr, Bell et al.
2015) Tucana-Horologium [Tuc-Hor] association. We further note
that the position of RXJ0850.1-7554 in proper motion space lies
several sigma away from the main Eta Cha clump, and in fact

a − We compare our UVES RVs to those detailed in J06 [UVES - J06 values]. Two values listed represent two epochs in the J06 study, which for
RXJ0951.9-7901, include its status as a double-lined spectroscopic binary (J06).
b − Spectral types for Chamaeleon stars are taken from Covino et al. (1997) and Alcalá et al. (2000), whereas Martín et al. (1998) data were used for Rho
Ophiuchus stars, except for RXJ1625.6-2613, whose spectral type was reclassiﬁed as K7Ve in Torres et al. (2006).
c − Li/residual H α features were measured for EWs; by residual, we mean that the normalized spectrum of an old, slowly rotating minimum-activity
standard star, of similar spectrum type, broadening if the target has υsini > 10 km s−1, was ﬁrst subtracted from the normalized spectrum of each target.
d − EWs measured using a Gaussian ﬁt between the limits of where the Li feature approaches unity on either side of its central absorption feature.
e − EWs measured using direct integration between the same wavelength limits as for the Gaussian ﬁtting method.
f − EWs of residual H α emission features were measured with either a Gaussian (G) or Lorentzian (L) function, with limits placed where the feature
approaches the continuum level on the red and blue wings. For the Rho Ophiuchus target, RXJ1625.6-2613, the residual emission proﬁle presented
substantial non-uniform morphology and sub-structure, which was not adequately ﬁtted by either a Gaussian or Lorentzian function.
g − Approximate S/N of continuum region around 6700Å.
h − UVES data were not obtained for this target; for reference, we reproduce here the measurements of J06.

Elliott et al. (2014) report that RXJ0850.1-7554 is a member of the
30 Myr Carina association.

A further four objects, RXJ1158.5-7754a, RXJ1159.7-7601,
RXJ1201.7-7859 and RXJ1239.4-7502 are kinematic members
of Eps Chamaeleon (in agreement with the recent Eps Cha
membership allocations given by Murphy et al. 2013). Two
stars, RXJ1112.7-7637 and RXJ1129.2-7546, have proper mo-
tion vectors consistent with the Cham I SFR (in accord with
López Martí et al. 2013a), although we note that there is some
overlap in this region of the kinematic phase diagram with the
Cham II cloud and a wide slew of background sources. We further
note that RXJ1303.5-7701 is kinematically consistent with mem-
bership of the Cham II association. Finally, RXJ1233.5-7523 has

a very discrepant proper motion vector compared to the any of
the Chamaeleon sub-groups, and indeed many of the background
sources in the region. We therefore judge this star to be a mem-
ber of the ﬁeld population, (concordant with the López Martí et al.
2013a ﬁndings) and do not consider it further in our analysis.

3.2 UVES Radial Velocities

One-dimensional kinematic membership of parent SFRs can be
judged through assessment of their RV vectors, which are provided
in Table 3. For the Chamaeleon candidates, except for RXJ1303.5-
7701, this is a simple process because there is a clear grouping of
values ≃15 km s−1, within a scatter of a few km s−1. This velocity

Figure 2. Left-hand panel: In units of degrees, Galactic longitude (l) and latitude (b) are plotted for our Chamaeleon (•) and Rho Ophiuchus (•) candidate
SFR members. Comparable data for several well-described SFRs, taken from Sartori et al. (2003), are included for reference (US − Upper Scorpius; UCL −
Upper Centaurus Lupus; Lup − Lupus; LCC − Lower Centaurus Crux). Right-hand panel: In concert with data for several sub-groups of the Chamaeleon SFR
(López Martí et al. 2013a), proper motion vectors (in mas/yr) are plotted for stars in our Chamaeleon sample. The proper motion data for RXJ1233.5-7523
(middle-left of the plot) show that this star does not belong to any of the main sub-groups of the Chamaeleon SFR.

clumping correlates extremely well with extant RV measurements
of objects in the Chamaeleon region (J06, Guenther et al. 2007,
Nguyen et al. 2012; Biazzo et al. 2012; Frasca et al. 2015). We note
that the Carina and Tuc-Hor associations have systemic RVs of
9.7 ± 0.5 and 20.9 ± 0.9 km s−1 respectively (Kraus et al. 2014,
Malo et al. 2013). For the Chamaeleon candidates RXJ0850.1-
7554, RXJ0951.9-7901 & RXJ1140.3-8321, which are suspected
of being members of either the Carina or Tuc-Hor associations in-
stead of the η Cham associations, our UVES RVs cannot unambigu-
ously distinguish between the three associations.

For RXJ1303.5-7701 however, this object is either a non-
member of one of the Chamaeleon regions or a binary system, or
both. Comparison of its UVES RV to the one reported by J06 shows
that the object is binary in nature (RV variant). Moreover, our UVES
spectrum conﬁrms the James et al. ﬁnding that the object is of early-
type spectral-type, having few metal lines and very broad H α and
Hβ Balmer series line proﬁles, when indeed a G7 spectrum was
expected (Alcalá et al. 2000). A zoom-in of a red-plate DSS image
shows that, in fact, there is a visual double in the RASS X-ray er-
ror circle of RXJ1303.5-7701, one star extremely bright, the other
one less so. Our spectroscopic observations (J06 and UVES data
presented herein) may therefore not be for the correct optical coun-
terpart in the RASS X-ray error circle, and in a case of mistaken
identity of the brighter star with the fainter one, the true source of
the X-ray emission remains elusive.

However for the Rho Ophiuchus stars in our sample, a 1-d
kinematic analysis is a little more difﬁcult to interpret − essen-
tially through a paucity of existing data for our stars and the na-
ture of their single-epoch measurements. However, while there are
not extensive, programmatic velocity surveys of the Rho Ophi-
uchus region yet published, the 1-d radial velocity of its low-
mass members is now quite well established to be −7.0 ± 0.7
km s−1 (Kurosawa et al. 2006, Guenther et al. 2007, Prato 2007).
With the obvious exceptions of RXJ1620.1-2348 and RXJ1624.0-
2456, most of our Rho Ophiuchus stars do indeed have UVES RVs
clustered around the SFR systemic velocity of −7.0 km s−1, albeit
with a scatter of ∼ 4 km s−1.

MNRAS 000, 1–34 (2016)

3.2.1 Radial Velocities: Comparison to J06

Because our UVES spectra were acquired approximately two years
after the FEROS data presented in the J06 study, a comparison of
their time-separated RVs allows us to identify obvious binary stars
in our sample. In order to facilitate such a comparison, we have in-
cluded a separate column in Table 3 detailing a star-by-star RV dif-
ference between the two studies. From two closely-spaced epochs
in our UVES data, the RVs of ROXR1 13 are indicative of orbital
motion over the course of about 2 hours, albeit that the per-datum
precision is quite low (2-3 km s−1) due to the high rotation veloc-
ity of the object. For the two Rho Ophiuchus stars common to our
study and the J06 one, there is no strong evidence of RV variation.
Three Chamaeleon objects appear to be RV variable. The
early-type star RXJ1303.5-7701 shows a very large ∆RV value and
is clearly a spectroscopic binary star, although there is no evidence
or a second or third set of spectral lines in our UVES spectra. Based
on our studies alone, RXJ1201.7-7859 is consistent with being a
single-lined spectroscopic binary star [SB1], with three RVs quite
widely separated from each other, at values 4-5 times the per-datum
measurement error. Combined with literature RV values however
(Malaroda et al. 2006; Torres et al. 2006; López Martí et al. 2013a;
Murphy et al. 2013; Elliott et al. 2014), its SB1 is conﬁrmed.

One of the more interesting curiosities is that of RXJ0951.9-
7901. Its J06 entry shows that it is a rapidly-rotating, double-lined
spectroscopic binary [SB2], whose double-line features were de-
tected over two different epochs of observation (separated by about
6-days). It is worth noting that K-band speckle interferometry and
direct imaging of the system show that it has no nearby compan-
ions in the 0.13-6.0 arcsecond range (Köhler 2001), although its
J06 K1 and K2 velocities are large enough that both components
of an SB2 system at the distance of the Chamaeleon region would
easily lie inside an 0.13” annulus. Our UVES spectrum only shows
a single peak in the cross-correlation function, which can be readily
explained as having been observed at inferior or superior conjunc-
tion of an SB2 system. Based on a further three epochs of observa-
tions, Covino et al. (1997) and Guenther et al. (2007) list this star

99 mÅ, considerably below its Pleiades counterparts. Given that its
RV is also considerably discrepant from the systemic 1-d velocity
of Rho Ophiuchus, we postulate that this star is more likely to be a
non-member of its parent SFR than a member, and do not consider
it in further in our analyses. In the case of the two low-Lithium
Chamaeleon candidates, simple explanations present themselves
readily.

Figure 3. Lithium 6708Å equivalent width is plotted against effective tem-
perature for our candidate members of the Chamaeleon (◦) and Rho Ophi-
uchus (△) SFRs. The boxed data-point represents the proper motion non-
member of the Chamaeleon regions, RXJ1233.5-7523. The hand-drawn
dashed black line indicates a by-eye estimate of the upper boundary of
Lithium for their similar-Tef f counterparts in the 125 Myr Pleiades open
cluster (∗; Soderblom et al. 1993).

as RV-constant, whose RV values are within ∼ 1-2 km s−1 of our
UVES value. Finally, Torres et al. (2006) report four epochs of RV
measurements for this star, close to our RV value, albeit with quite
a large scatter (6.1 km s−1); for such a rapidly rotating star, such a
scatter is not particularly unusual. Its J06 SB2 nature may therefore
be in doubt, and further RV observations are necessary in order for
us to conﬁrm or refute its multiplicity status.

3.3 Lithium abundance of young stars

Fortunately, we can call on Lithium detection as a criterion in as-
sessing youth, and by inference, membership of a young SFR. As
both Chamaeleon and Rho Ophiuchus are considered to be active,
or at least very recent, sites of star formation, one would expect
that insufﬁcient time has passed for substantial depletion of natal
Lithium (by proton burning - Bodenheimer 1965) to have occurred.
Members of young SFRs should therefore contain Lithium abun-
dance levels far in excess of their typically-much older ﬁeld star
counterparts in the Galaxy.

Because determining precise and accurate ages of ﬁeld stars
is problematic at best, sometimes yielding different ages for differ-
ent methods (e.g. Barnes 2007, Cargile & James 2010), we choose
to compare Lithium levels in our young SFR candidate mem-
bers to a main sequence open cluster of known age, such as the
125-Myr Pleiades (Basri et al. 1996; Stauffer et al. 1998). Plot-
ted in Figure 3, we show the Lithium EWs of Chamaeleon and
Rho Ophiuchus candidates (c.f., Table 3), as a function of ef-
fective temperature (using the spectral type-temperature relation
for main sequence stars reported by Kenyon & Hartmann 1995 -
[KH95]); also included, are corresponding data for the Pleiades
cluster (Soderblom et al. 1993). Clearly, most of the Chamaeleon
and Rho Ophiuchus candidates are indeed Lithium rich, containing
at least as much Lithium as their Pleiades counterparts, oftentimes
far more.

There are three notable exceptions to this statement. In
Rho Ophiuchus, RXJ1620.1-2348 exhibits a Lithium EW of only

RXJ1233.5-7523
(López Martí et al. 2013a – see also Figure 2) show that this
star does not belong to any of the main sub-groups of the
Chamaeleon SFR, and its low Lithium EW is indicative of its
ﬁeld star status. Star RXJ1140.3-8321 however is a proper motion
member of the Eta Cha region (6-7 Myr old, Murphy et al. 2013),
has a set of invariant radial velocities consistent with Eta Cha
membership, and has a Li I 6708 Å EW within ±10 per cent of
the J06 study. However, as we have discussed previously in this
section, there is evidence to suggest that this particular star in
fact belongs to the considerably older (45 Myr) Tuc-Hor associ-
ation. While Jeffries et al. ( 2009) warn that pre-main sequence
[PMS] Lithium depletion in solar-type stars cannot be conﬁdently
employed as a precise age indicator in young kinematic groups,
the Lithium abundance of RXJ1140.3-8321 strongly indicates a
post-T Tauri star evolutionary status (c.f., ﬁgure 6 of Jeffries et al.
2009 & ﬁgure 7 of Kraus et al. 2014). We henceforth consider
RXJ1140.3-8321 as a Tuc-Hor candidate member.

In the cases of RXJ0850.1-7554 and RXJ0951.9-7901, adding
in Lithium into the membership consideration, we still cannot dis-
tinguish between their belonging to η Cha or Carina/Tuc-Hor re-
spectively. This is because even after 30-40 Myr of stellar evo-
lution post birthline, mid-G stars still nave not undergone sub-
stantial Lithium depletion, and their position in an abundance-
temperature plot cannot be differentiated from that of very young
T-Tauri stars (Jeffries et al. 2009). We return to their membership
status in § 3.6 & 3.6.1.

3.3.1 Lithium: Comparison to J06

Naturally, we ought to compare the variation in Li I 6708Å EWs for
those stars common to the present study and that of J06 (see Fig-
ure 4), because outwith the different instruments used, the formal-
ism of the data analysis procedures is identical. With the exception
of a few systems, there is good agreement between the two cam-
paigns. However in the case of the deviant Rho Ophiuchus datum
(RXJ1627.1-2419) at ≃ 250 mÅ, the disagreement can likely be
explained by comparison to the low quality spectrum (S/N=14) in
the J06 study, manifested as a poor Gaussian ﬁt to the data and/or
poor continuum placement. For the two most deviant Cham stars,
one is again likely due to a poor quality (S/N=11) J06 spectrum
of the Cham I star RXJ1129.2-7546. The other, η Cham candidate
RXJ0951.9-7601 (although, see also § 3.6.1 for details of its can-
didacy of the Tuc-Hor group), it is listed as a double-lined spectro-
scopic binary star in the J06 study, and moreover, of the late-type
stars in our samples it is the fastest rotator. Potentially, this is an
interesting system for a time-domain Lithium variation follow-up
campaign, although line-blending due to rapid rotation and/or bi-
narity make it a problematic system for detailed analysis.

5) extinction values (c.f. Tables 4 & B1). We posit that these high
reddening/extinction stars are either (i) situated in heavy extinc-
tion regions of their parent clouds and/or (ii) systems hosting cir-
cumstellar accretion/debris discs, which act to mimic the effects of
high reddening/extinction, especially in the near and mid-infrared.
Further discussion and analysis of the high extinction stars are pre-
sented in § 3.5 & § 4.

3.5 Classical or Weak-Lined?

Exploiting near-infrared photometry can be an efﬁcient, powerful,
didactic method for triaging classical and weak-lined stars. A quick
visual inspection of Figure 5 allows such a methodology to be eas-
ily understood, although caution must be used in interpreting high
interstellar extinction cases. In this colour-colour diagram, we plot
JHK photometry for our candidate members of the Chamaeleon and
Rho Ophiuchus SFRs, as well as loci of ﬁeld dwarfs and giants, and
by extension, their high extinction loci. For comparison, we also
plot the data for a sample of F→ M-dwarfs on the main sequence
(Nidever et al. 2002), as well as data for a sample of known Clas-
sical T Tauri stars in the very young (≃ 1 − 2 Myr) Orion Nebula
Cluster (e.g. Neuhäuser et al. 1995).

This colour-colour diagram, and the data presented in Table 4,
show that one star in Chamaeleon and four stars in Rho Ophi-
uchus exhibit substantial infrared excess, having data positions
well-displaced from un-reddened main-sequence late-type dwarf
and giant loci. Interestingly, these ﬁve candidates, RXJ1112.7-
7637 (Cham), ROXR1 13 (ρ Oph), RXJ1621.2-2347 (ρ Oph),
RXJ1624.8-2359 (ρ Oph) and RXJ1627.1-2419 (ρ Oph) yield
E(J − H) and/or E(H − K) derived extinctions of Av > 5. The
remainder of our sample exhibits more moderate extinction, consis-
tent with their having little or moderate infrared excess emission. A
handful of stars have infrared colours that lie close to the giant lo-
cus, and in-between the giant and dwarf loci, which if conﬁrmed as
young members of their parent SFRs, one can imagine interpreting
them as being sub-giant-like stars still in the very early pre-main
sequence phase (<10Myr), having somewhat inﬂated radii thereby
mimicking giant-like stellar properties.

These ﬁve high extinction objects (Av>5), are Lithium
rich (see Table 3 and Martín et al. 1998), and are therefore
good candidates for classical T-Tauri star status. Historically,
albeit with some deﬁnition differences among various authors
and speciﬁc SFRs, classical T-Tauri stars invariably exhibit very
strong Balmer series H α emission (EWHα > 5 − 10Å −
Barrado y Navascués & Martín 2003, Martín et al. 1998). Only one
of our targets, RXJ1625.6-2613, shows H α emission at these
CTTS-like levels (see also § C4), and in fact, none of the ﬁve
high extinction stars have EWHα > 5Å. The four high extinc-
tion Rho Ophiuchus stars are listed as being either WTTS or
young solar-type stars in Martín et al. (1998). While several ob-
jects in our sample exhibit H α EWs of order 1 − 3Å, these
activity emission levels are consistent with rapidly rotating late-
type stars early on the PMS and zero-age main sequence (e.g.
Soderblom et al. 1993, James & Jeffries 1997, Martín et al. 1998,
Jeffries et al. 2000, Jeffries et al. 2009).

3.5.1 H α Activity: Comparison to J06

The most likely scenario where activity in the Balmer series H
α 6563 Å line is temporally variable for our targets is two-
pronged. For such young stars, some combination of circumstellar

between the present study and that of J06. Some stars are shown twice,
representing multiple epochs of measurement in the J06 study. The solid
line represents equality between the two studies and is not a ﬁt to the data.

3.4 Reddening Vectors and Extinction

By comparing our target optical and near-infrared photometry (see
Table 2) to theoretical colours based on their spectral type (see
Table 3), we can determine photometric colour-dependent redden-
ing and extinction vectors for each SFR candidate member; results
of this analysis are presented in Table 4. We note that a small
handful of stars yield astrophysically unrealistic negative redden-
ing values, which may result from incorrect spectral type classi-
ﬁcations and/or variable photometric data (presumably resulting
from heightened stellar activity), and we decline to calculate extinc-
tion values for them. Furthermore, we remind the reader that our
reddening/extinction analyses are founded upon KH95 model pa-
rameters, which are based on main sequence stellar properties. For
stellar objects in young star formation regions, such an approach
may not be entirely appropriate. In Appendix B, we re-perform our
reddening/extinction analyses using the recent pre-main sequence
model parameters presented by Pecaut & Mamajek (2013), with
relevant discussion included therein.

For our targets in the Chamaeleon sub-regions, most stars ex-
hibit modest Av values (Av≪ 1) derived from optical and near-
infrared photometry. Two objects however, RXJ1112.7-7637 &
RXJ1129.2-7546, show elevated levels of extinction (Av>1) across
the optical and near-infrared range. The case for Rho Ophiuchus is
considerably more interesting however, with > 90 per cent of the
sample showing elevated reddening and extinction values across
the optical and near-infrared colours; such a result is hardly surpris-
ing when one considers the abundantly clear evidence of interstel-
lar gas and dust to be found in the magniﬁcent true colour images
of the Rho Ophiuchus region (e.g. Hatchell et al. 2012). Four Rho
Ophiuchus stars, RXJ1621.2-2347, RXJ1624.8-2359, ROXR1 13
& RXJ1627.1-2419, exhibit in high (Av > 5) extinction values.

We note that irrespective of whether main-sequence or pre-
main sequence theoretical data are used,
the same stars in
Chamaeleon and Rho Ophiuchus are shown to have high (Av,λ >

a − Reddening vectors are calculated by subtracting appropriate photometric colours for each target (see Table 2) from corresponding theoretical values for
dwarf stars (from KH95) based on their spectral types (see Table 3).
b − E(J − H) and E(H − K) vectors are based on KH95 JHK data which had been ﬁrst transformed onto the 2MASS system using the Carpenter (2001)

c − Extinction vectors [Av], based on four colour-dependent reddening vectors, are calculated to be: For optical data, Av=3.1×E(B − V ) and
Av=2.48×E(V − Ic) (from Bessell & Brett 1988); For infrared data, Av=8.86×E(J − H) and Av=16.32×E(H − K) (from Ramírez & Meléndez 2005).
d − Two sets of reddening and extinction values are calculated, one for each of the two spectral sub-types.

disc-accretion (Szegedi-Elek et al. 2013; Sousa et al. 2016) and/or
chromospheric magnetic activity (Eibe 1998; Barnes et al. 2001;
Bell et al. 2012) can readily explain short- and long-term spectral
line variations in the Balmer series H α species.

Comparing H α emission in the present sample to the J06
one (see Figure 6) reveals several interesting objects. In the two
Rho Oph cases, there is convincing empirical evidence to suggest
that both stars have circumstellar accretion discs (see § 4 and Fig-
ure 12), and high levels of extinction (at least Av > 4), which nat-
urally provides a physical environment with which to explain their
Balmer series H α variable emission over widely-separated epochs.
In the case of Chamaeleon candidates, there are two clear
cases of variable H α emission between the J06 and present study.
The ﬁrst arises from the very rapid rotator RXJ0951.9-7901, which
is listed as a double-lined spectroscopic binary in J06, and will be
re-classiﬁed in this study as a 45 Myr Tuc-Hor object (see discus-
sion in § 3.6.1). Given its rapid rotation, modest extinction (see
Table 4), post-T Tauri age and clean bare photosphere SED (see § 4
and Figure D2), its time variable H α emission is most likely due to
a chromospherically-induced temporal event such as stellar activity

− and its cycle − and/or a magnetic activity ﬂare. The second is a
Cham I object (RXJ1112.7-7637), which exhibits high levels of ex-
tinction (Av > 5) and shows clear evidence of near- and mid-infra
red excess in its SED (see Figure 12). In this case, we feel comfort-
able attributing its H α emission variability to physical processes
associated with its circumstellar accretion disc.

3.6 Hertzsprung-Russell Diagrams: Mass, Age

Placing observational parameters onto the theoretical plane is a
well-established and well-calibrated method of determining funda-
mental stellar characteristics. Converting photometry and spectral
types into bolometric luminosity and effective temperatures allows
the construction of HRDs, which when combined with theoretical
stellar models, yields mass and age determinations for a sample of
stars.

Using main sequence bolometric corrections and spectral
type-photometric colours & effective temperature relations from
KH95, we calculate bolometric luminosity for each of our targets
employing their V-magnitudes detailed in Table 2 and four sepa-

yses are detailed in Tables 5 & 6, and graphically represented in
Figures 7−10.

Based on proper motion and radial velocity vectors (see
§ 3.1), we triage our Chamaeleon candidates into their parent kine-
matic group. However, in the case of RXJ1140.3-8321, in go-
ing forward we consider it more likely a member of the older
≃ 40 Myr Tuc-Hor association (Bell et al. 2015; Kraus et al. 2014;
Elliott et al. 2014), and use the Elliott et al. (2014) distance of 48pc
in calculating its bolometric luminosity. For RXJ0850.1-7554 and
RXJ0951.9-7901, we start with the assumption that the objects are
candidate members of the η Cha association. However, in light of
the arguments presented in § 3.1− § 3.3, after having considered
their HRD properties, we will re-evaluate their membership prop-
erties at the end of § 3.6.1.

It has occurred to us that we are using main sequence theoreti-
cal models to determine effective temperatures and bolometric cor-
rections, which may not be wholly appropriate for stars in young
SFRs. While we continue with this analysis, we also perform an
HRD age and mass analysis using pre-main sequence empirically
calibrated stellar parameters, the results of which are presented in
§ B.

3.6.1 HRD: Stellar Ages

While small number statistics for the individual Chamaeleon sub-
groups, as well as the Rho Ophiuchus sample, precludes a detailed
analysis of their ages, a colour-dependent HRD analysis can be in-
formative in the assessment of stellar youth. One caveat lector to
bear in mind is that ﬁve stars, RXJ1112.7-7637 (Cham), ROXR1
13 (ρ Oph), RXJ1621.2-2347 (ρ Oph), RXJ1624.8-2359 (ρ Oph)
and RXJ1627.1-2419 (ρ Oph) show evidence of elevated extinction
(Av > 5), as well as exhibiting strongly colour-dependent extinc-
tion vectors (see Table 4), characteristics likely to produce colour-
dependent ages and masses in the HRDs.

HRDs ages of our limited numbers of stars across the Cham
I and ǫ Chamaeleon regions are broadly consistent with young
SFRs having ages ∼<5-10 Myr. Both Cham I stars have mean ages

ing in age as the extinction relationships derived go from blue
to red reddening vectors (i.e., E(B − V ) → E(H − K)).
Of these targets, RXJ1621.2-2347, RXJ1623.4-2425, RXJ1624.8-
2359, RXJ1625.4-2346, RXJ1627.1-2419, three exhibit Av> 5 val-
ues (see § 3.4). As to why the age determinations of RXJ1623.4-
2425 especially, and RXJ1625.4-2346, change so markedly as a
function of colour-dependent extinction we cannot explain. We also
note that RXJ1623.4-2425 and RXJ1625.0-2508 appear to be con-
siderably older than the remainder of the Rho Ophiuchus sample.

3.6.2 HRD: Stellar Masses

With the exception of three stars, RXJ1112.7-7637, ROXR1 13
and RXJ1627.1-2419, stellar masses derived from the HRDs are
remarkably consistent (see Table 6), and show that our sample is
essentially composed of stars 1 − 2 times the mass of the Sun. The
masses for one Cham I, and three Rho Ophiuchus objects, are not
constrained, which except for our coolest K7e star, is caused by
strong (Av>5) and variable extinction across the four photometric
colours we consider.

The observed age and mass dependence for some of our ob-
jects on the colour used to derive Av is likely the product of excess
emission from circumstellar discs. For instance, a target with ex-
cess emission in the red/infrared will appear older when using bluer
colours, i.e. B − V and V − I, due to a downward shift on the di-
agram. To further examine this disc hypothesis, in § 4 compare our
Y4KCam and 2MASS photometry for each of our objects, as well
as publically available infrared photometry from several other in-
struments, with theoretical spectral energy distributions for young
stellar objects with discs.

3.6.3 HRD: Comparing Stellar Models:

In an attempt to quantify the dependence of derived stellar masses
and ages on our choice of stellar evolutionary model, we can eas-
ily compare our PARSEC results with those calculated using other
stellar models. For convenience, we have chosen the isochrones
and mass tracks of the Dartmouth group Dotter et al. (2008) and
the D’Antona & Mazzitelli (1997) [DAM97] team, both of which
are of solar-metallicity. The former has an initial He content of
Y=0.274 and does not explicitly include Deuterium burning dur-
ing the pre-main sequence, while the latter does include Deuterium
burning on the PMS starting with an initial abundance of 2
1H of

< 5Myr, which are perfectly aligned with the results of Luhman
(2007) and Spina et al. (2014). Interpreting the mean age deter-
minations for our four ǫ Cham stars is also straightforward, as
they all return consistent values of ∼<5 Myr, in agreement with the
Feigelson et al. (2003) and Murphy et al. (2013) studies.

For the η Cham candidates, both RXJ0850.1-7554 and
RXJ0951.9-7901 appear to be considerably older than the 5-10 Myr
age of the group (Lawson et al. 2001, Luhman & Steeghs 2004),
having ages at least 25-30 Myr, more appropriate to those of post
T-Tauri stars. This supposition for both of these objects is consis-
tent with the Elliott et al. (2014) assertion that they are members of
older associations (30 Myr Carina in the case of RXJ0850.1-7554,
and the ≃ 40 Myr Tuc-Hor group in the case of RXJ0951.9-7901).
For RXJ1140.3-8321, which was already assumed to be a Tuc-Hor
member, its K95 HRD analysis unsurprisingly yields isochronal
ages of ∼ 50 Myr for both measurements of its K3 and K4 spectral
types.

In the case of Rho Ophiuchus stars, their HRD mean ages
show clear evidence of a group of young SFR objects broadly
consistent with a ≃ 1-10 Myr distribution, supporting conclu-
sions found by Luhman & Rieke (1999), Wilking et al. (2005) &
Alves de Oliveira et al. (2010). Several stars exhibit a spread in
ages, based on different colour extinction relations in the Lbol/L⊙
calculation, of an order-of-magnitude or more, always decreas-

4.5 × 10−5, and incorporates an initial He content of Y=0.280. We
also note that the DAM97 model also relies upon a gray atmosphere
approximation as an exterior boundary condition, which will have
different effects on stellar effective temperatures and luminosities
compared to the D08 and PARSEC models. For brevity, we restrict
ourselves at the present time to a comparison of the models con-
taining Lbol/L⊙ calculations using Av extinction values derived
from B-V colours and effective temperatures derived from KH95
main-sequence spectral types. The graphical and numerical results
of their inter-comparability are presented in Figure 11 and Table 7.

Our analysis shows that for extinction based on B-V colours,
the Dartmouth group isochrones return stellar ages that are on av-
erage 0.68 Myr (± 0.21) older than the PARSEC ones, whereas the
DAM97 ones are 2.86 Myr (± 0.58) younger. For the Cham I, ǫ

Cha and Rho Ophiuchus stars, such a large PARSEC/DAM97 age
differential actually represents a substantial fraction of the system
age (≃ 30 − 50 per cent). For extinction based on other colours
(V-Ic, J-H, H-Ks), we ﬁnd that Dartmouth models remain closely
matched to their PARSEC counterparts being 0.68 ± 1.06 Myr
younger, 0.08 ± 0.29 Myr older and 0.03 ± 0.44 Myr younger re-
spectively. For the DAM97 model comparisons however, the other
three colour-based extinctions again yield younger ages albeit at a
lower level than their B-V colours (1.32 ± 2.06, 0.68 ± 0.98 and
1.50 ± 1.56 Myr younger for V-Ic, J-H and H-Ks colours respec-
tively).

In terms of masses, the Dartmouth models are essentially iden-
tical to the PARSEC ones across all four colour-based extinctions
(0.00 ± 0.02, 0.03 ± 0.09, 0.02 ± 0.06 and 0.03 ± 0.04 M⊙ - the

4 PRESENCE OF DISC EMISSION: SPECTRAL

ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS

In order to conﬁrm the presence of circumstellar disc material in-
ferred from stellar positions in colour-colour space (see § 3.5), we
construct SEDs and compare them to theoretical radiative trans-
fer models. We combine optical photometry derived in this work
(§ 2.1) with additional near- and mid-infrared photometry gath-
ered from the literature; these data are presented in Tables 2, E1
and E2. Following the procedure described in Aarnio et al. (2010),

these photometric data were ﬁt using the computed SED grid of
Robitaille et al. (2007). These ∼200,000 radiative transfer models
include a central star surrounded by a ﬂaring disc and envelope;
the properties of these model components vary as described by a
set of 14 parameters. Additional parameters used to constrain the
ﬁtter include Av and distance: the allowed range of Av was set to
0-10mag for both SFRs, while the distance range for the different
Chamaeleon regions was conﬁned to 100-175 pc; Rho Ophiuchus
member distances were constrained to be within 110-150 pc.

In those cases where substantial infrared excess was seen, we
ﬁltered the resulting best ﬁt models based on known stellar proper-
ties. Spectral types reported in Table 3 were converted to effective
temperatures via the KH95 relationships, and only models whose
central star has Tef f within 500K of the estimated effective tem-
perature were included. One should retain some level of caution
with this approach, as young, solar-type stars can show photomet-

of on-going accretion, rapid rotation and extreme (and stochas-
tic) chromospheric and coronal magnetic activity. The sample of
best-ﬁt models was further narrowed by accepting only cases in
which the χ2 ﬁt value was within a 99.73 per cent conﬁdence level
(∆χ2 =11.8) of the (post-Tef f rejection) best ﬁt. Finally, models
with disc masses <10−10 M⊙ were rejected.

Our SED analysis shows substantial excess for three Rho
Ophiuchus objects and one Chamaeleon star (see Figure 12). In
three additional Rho Ophiuchus stars, we see low to moderate
mid-infrared excess (see Figure D1); the SEDs for the remain-
der of the sample are consistent with bare photospheres (see Fig-
ures D2 & D3). We compare our SED ﬁt Av values to those cal-
culated via extinction laws in § 3.4 and Table 4, ﬁnding that for
stars with evidence of circumstellar discs, extinction derived from

optical photometry best matches the SED-ﬁt derived Av values (es-
pecially for V-I), presumably due to the complications of active
accretion or disc radiation in the infra-red. For stars without disc
signatures, we ﬁnd the near infrared reddening vector E(H-Ks) pro-
duces Av values in better agreement with the SED results; to our
mind, this is attributable to the variable and difﬁcult-to-quantify ef-
fect (starspots, ﬂares, etc.) of stellar magnetic activity on optical
photometry.

In the four star+disc systems with the most near- to mid-
infrared excess (see Figure 12), we ﬁnd that the best-ﬁt model
parameters have the greatest disc masses, highest accretion rates,
and all show some sign of emission (or blueshifted absorption) in
their H α proﬁles, which are tell-tale indicators of ongoing activ-
ity, accretion, or outﬂow. In fact, all four stars exhibit narrow-lined
neutral Oxygen [O I] 5577.3 Å emission in their UVES spectra,

oftentimes shown to originate in a circumstellar disc or envelope.
For RXJ1627.1-2419, its O I proﬁle is actually complex in nature,
and looks double-peaked. Moreover, both RXJ1112.7-7637 and
RXJ1627.1-2419 also show narrow O I emission lines at 6300.2 &
6363.9 Å. ROXR1 13 only produces a narrow 6363.9 Å emission
feature as opposed to RXJ1625.6-2613 which only shows 6300.2
Å in emission.

Interestingly, the UVES spectra of ROXR1 13 and RXJ1627.1-
2419 both show P Cygni like proﬁles in the neutral Sodium dou-
blet at ≃ 5900 Å (Fraunhofer D lines), indicative of a dense
magneto-hydrodynamical driven stellar wind and self-absorption
through a circumstellar accretion disc (e.g., Israelian & de Groot
1999). For completeness, we note that RXJ1112.7-7637 also ex-
hibits small narrow-lined emission features at 6410.1 Å, 6505.4
Å, 6523.5 Å and 6529.0 Å, while RXJ1627.1-2419 produces an
emission feature at 5615.3 Å (all observing-frame wavelengths).
Finally, RXJ1625.6-2613 has small emission features at 5875.1 Å
and 6678.2 Å, which may be He I and/or O II species).

In three of four cases, the models indicate disc truncation at
the dust destruction radius; in the sole case with a best-ﬁt disc trun-
cated beyond Rtrunc, RXJ1627.1-2419, there is existing evidence
that this object is characterized by a transition disc (McClure et al.
2010). We present best-ﬁt model parameters for all seven (7) ob-
jects with moderate to substantial disc excess in Table C1, and we
provide additional discussion of each object, including a review of
extant observations garnered from the literature (see § C).

Except in the strongest two cases, we ﬁnd no correlation be-
tween the residual H α equivalent width and disc excess indicators;
this is perhaps unsurprising, given the youth of the sample stars and
the wide range of H α ﬂuxes observed in stars <100 Myr of age (cf.
Herbig 1985; Herbig & Bell 1988; Kenyon & Hartmann 1995).

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have obtained optical BV Ic photometry and high-resolution
spectroscopy for a modest sample of X-ray selected stars in the
Chamaeleon and Rho Ophiuchus SFRs. We exploit our observa-
tional data in order to pursue ﬁve principle avenues of investigation
with the goal of establishing fundamental properties of our target
stars; (I:) RVs and Lithium detections are employed in assigning
1-d kinematic membership of the sample’s parent associations, as
well as in the assessment of stellar youth; (II:) in combination with
2MASS near-IR photometry and optical spectral types, we use our
optical BV Ic data in order to calculate colour-dependent redden-
ing vectors and Av values; (III:) in an J − H/H − K diagram, we
search for evidence of IR-excess in our targets, which is the smok-
ing gun evidence normally associated with viscous circumstellar
discs; (IV:) transforming observational plane photometry and spec-
tral types onto the theoretical plane of Lbol/L⊙ and Tef f , we con-
struct HRDs based on four different colour-dependent Av values,
thereby allowing us to establish model-dependent stellar age and
mass; (V:) we compare our optical photometry, as well as extant
near- and mid-IR photometry in the literature, to radiative transfer
models in order to construct SEDs for all of our targets, identifying
and (re-)conﬁrming systems consistent with circumstellar accretion
discs.

For our Chamaeleon candidates, we ab initio took advan-
tage of 2-d kinematics in order to triage stars into three dis-
tinct sub-groups in the region. Two stars, RXJ1112.7-7637 and
RXJ1129.2-7546, have proper motions consistent with membership
of the Cham I group. Three stars, RXJ0850.1-7554, RXJ0951.9-

Figure 12. SEDs of Rho Ophiuchus and Chamaeleon candidates show, outwith the error budget, that signiﬁcant departures from a bare photosphere are clear,
i.e., substantial infrared excess is evident. Red diamonds and blue triangles denote photometry from Tables 2, E1 & E2 - where blue triangles are upper limits.
Dot-dashed lines are the best ﬁt synthetic SEDs as determined via criteria deﬁned in § 4, with dashed lines representing a stellar photospheric contribution
matching spectral-type derived effective temperature.

7901 and RXJ1140.3-8321, have proper motions in broad agree-
ment with membership of the η Cham population, well-aligned
with the López Martí et al. ﬁndings. In the more recent Elliott
et al. study however,
they advocate allocating a 30 Myr Ca-
rina association membership for RXJ0850.1-7554 and a 45 Myr
Tuc-Hor membership for both RXJ0951.9-7901 and RXJ1140.3-
8321. Moving forward into the analysis of the spectroscopic
data and theoretical HRDs, we retained η Cham tentative mem-
bership for these three objects, revisiting their membership sta-
tus as each additional layer of analysis was added. RXJ1233.5-
7523 is an obvious proper motion ﬁeld star not associated with
any of the Chamaeleon groups. The four remaining Chamaeleon
stars (RXJ1158.5-7754a, RXJ1159.7-7601, RXJ1201.7-7859 and
RXJ1239.4-7502) are kinematic members of the Eps Cham group.

With one exception, RXJ1303.5-7701, all of our Chamaeleon
candidates yield UVES RVs consistent with membership of large
samples of low-mass, young stars in the Chamaeleon region. Ex-

cept for RXJ1620.1-2348 and RXJ1624.0-2456, the majority of our
Rho Ophiuchus sample also reﬂect this behaviour in presenting 1-d
kinematics consistent with membership of the parent Rho Ophi-
uchus cloud. Our UVES data show that three Chamaeleon group
stars are RV variable, with conﬁrmation that RXJ1201.7-7859 and
RXJ1303.5-7701 are SB1 systems. Our spectra do not conﬁrm the
J06 ﬁnding that RXJ0951.9-7901 is an SB2, and we suggest that
further RV observations of this object are required to ﬁrmly estab-
lish its multiplicity status.

With four exceptions, our UVES spectra show that our sam-
ple stars are young by virtue of being Lithium rich, having Lithium
I 6708Å equivalent widths at least as large as their similar Tef f
counterparts in the 125-Myr Pleiades cluster, oftentimes far more.
Three of the four Li-poorer stars are either early-type (RXJ1303.5-
7701), or are proper motion non-members (RXJ1233.5-7523 &
RXJ1620.1-2348) of their parent associations. The low-Lithium
status of the fourth object, RXJ1140.3-8321, suggests that the star

18

is actually a post T-Tauri star considerably older than the ≃ 5 Myr
Eta Cha group. This supposition supports the Elliott et al. claim
that it is a member of the Tuc-Hor group, which going forward we
endorse. With the exception of the rapidly rotating possible SB2
system RXJ0951.9-7901, there is little evidence to suggest that our
objects have variable Lithium abundance over a two-year period.

One Chamaeleon star (RXJ1112.7-7637) and four Rho Ophi-
uchus stars (ROXR1 13, RXJ1621.2-2347, RXJ1624.8-2359 &
RXJ1627.1-2419) show evidence of substantial, Av > 5 infrared
excess, as judged by their displaced positions compared to un-
reddened dwarf and giant loci in the J − H/H − K colour-colour
diagram. Nevertheless, for the vast majority of stars in our sam-
ple, the Balmer series residual H α emission is < 5Å, except for
RXJ1625.6-2613, which has an equivalent width > 6Å. The major-
ity of our sample are therefore consistent, in terms of Balmer series
H α emission at least, with being weak-lined T-Tauri stars.

Employing main sequence models to derive bolometric cor-
rections as well as calculate spectral
type based photometric
colours and effective temperatures, we derive stellar ages and
masses based on theoretical HRDs for our targets using four sep-
arate extinction values based on B-V, V-Ic, J-H and H-K colours.
By comparison to the PARSEC theoretical models, we show that our
Cham I and ǫ Cham stars are consistent with membership of young
SFRs, having ages ∼<5 Myr across all four colour-based extinction
vectors − agreeing with several other studies across the literature.
For both η Cham candidates, RXJ0850.1-7554 and RXJ0951.9-
7901, post T-Tauri like ages of at least 25-30 Myr are calculated,
and so in agreement with Elliott et al. (2014), we henceforth advo-
cate their membership of the 30 Myr Carina and 45 Myr Tuc-Hor
associations, respectively. Several stars exhibit a spread in ages,
based on different colour extinction relations in the Lbol/L⊙ calcu-
lation, of an order-of-magnitude or more, always decreasing in age
as the extinction relationships derived go from blue to red redden-
ing vectors (i.e., E(B − V ) → E(H − K)). With the exception
of three stars, RXJ1112.7-7637, ROXR1 13 and RXJ1627.1-2419,
HRDs stellar masses are consistent across blue to red reddening
vectors, and reveal that our sample is mostly composed of objects
1 − 2 times the mass of the Sun. Three objects with determinable
masses are not well constrained because of strong (Av>5) and vari-
able extinction across the four photometric colours we consider.

We use our modest sample of X-ray selected stars in the
Chamaeleon, Carina, Tuc-Hor and Rho Ophiuchus regions to
benchmark the PARSEC stellar models against those of the DAM97
and Dartmouth groups. For extinction based on B-V colours,
we ﬁnd that there is good agreement between the PARSEC and
Dartmouth models at the slightly-older 0.68 (± 0.21) Myr level,
whereas the DAM97 models are younger by 2.86 (±0.58) Myr
− which is ≃ 30 − 50 per cent of the group’s age for Cham I,
ǫ Cha and Rho Ophiuchus. For extinction based on other colours
(V-Ic, J-H, H-Ks), we ﬁnd that Dartmouth models remain closely
matched to their PARSEC counterparts being only 0.68 ± 1.06 Myr
younger, 0.08 ± 0.29 Myr older and 0.03 ± 0.44 Myr younger re-
spectively. For the DAM97 model comparisons however, the other
three colour-based extinctions again yield younger ages albeit at a
lower level than their B-V colours (1.32 ± 2.06, 0.68 ± 0.98 and
1.64 ± 1.78 Myr − all younger − for V-Ic, J-H and H-Ks colours
respectively). In terms of masses, PARSEC and Dartmouth agree al-
most perfectly across all four colour-based extinction at the ≃ 2
per cent level. The DAM97 comparison is also quite good, with
PARSEC differences of ∼<0.1 M⊙ level across all four extinctions.
Concerned with having employed dwarf-class (main se-
quence) models to derive effective temperatures and bolometric

corrections for HRD construction in the analysis of our mostly
PMS objects, we repeated our analyses using spectral-type, colour
and bolometric corrections from PMS theoretical models. In calcu-
lating differential colour-dependent extinction vectors for our sam-
ple, the two infrared colours yield Av values based on E(J − H)
& E(H − K) ≃ 3 − 5 times their corresponding optical colour
Av values based on E(B − V ) & E(V − I) for Chamaeleon stars,
and ≃ 4 − 10 times in the case of the Rho Ophiuchus ensem-
ble. This implies that our stars are considerably more red in the
PMS models compared to the MS ones, in agreement with the ﬁnd-
ings of Pecaut & Mamajek (2013, their ﬁgure 4). An comparison
of HRD ages using the main sequence and PMS model data shows
that within the error bars, stellar age remains unaffected. In terms
of mass however, the PMS input to the HRD models consistently
yielded 0.1 − 0.3 M⊙ lower values than for the main sequence
analysis.

Complementing our BV Ic dataset with near- and mid-IR
photometry has allowed us to construct spectral energy distribu-
tions for each star in our sample. Comparison of these distributions
to radiative transfer models shows that most objects are consistent
with a bare stellar photosphere. In the event that these stars are not
too photospherically active (i.e., starspots), our bare photosphere
stars are bright enough, with well-characterized age and mass, that
they will make prime transiting exoplanet host targets for the up-
coming TESS mission.

Three

stars

(RXJ1623.1-2300,

RXJ1623.5-2523 &
RXJ1625.0-2508) exhibit marginal
signs of mid-IR excess
emission compared to their bare photosphere models. Of more
interest however are the one Chamaeleon star (RXJ1112.7-7637)
and three Rho Ophiuchus stars (ROXR1 13, RXJ1625.6-2613 &
RXJ1627.1-2419) that exhibit strong evidence of excess infrared
emission; the physical interpretation of this excess emission is
predicated upon infrared radiation originating in the circumstellar
accretion disc of a young star. These four stars are southerly
enough, bright enough and have well-established stellar age and
masses to lend themselves favourably to disc-imaging surveys
using state of the art facilities such as ALMA. High-resolution,
spatially resolved images of young stars hosting accretion discs are
prime candidates for the detection and characterization of intra-disc
gaps, and sites of active and on-going exoplanet formation.

APPENDIX A: OBSERVING LOGS FOR PHOTOMETRIC
AND SPECTROSCOPIC OBSERVING CAMPAIGNS

Logs for the photometric (Y4KCAM - see Table A1) and spectro-
scopic (UVES - see Table A2) observing campaigns of Chamaeleon
and Rho Ophiuchus candidate members are presented, and are ref-
erenced in § 2.

APPENDIX B: REDDENING VECTORS AND HRDS
USING PRE-MAIN SEQUENCE SPECTRAL-TYPE VS
COLOUR RELATIONSHIPS

Historically, studying properties of star forming region members
has oftentimes been benchmarked against samples of similar ef-
fective temperature main sequence stars and mixed suites of theo-
retical pre-main and main-sequence models (e.g. Neuhäuser et al.
1995, Covino et al. 1997, Martín et al. 1998, Luhman 2004,
James et al. 2006). In our own research programme, we too have
adopted this philosophy, all the while pondering how appropriate it
is to employ dwarf-class effective temperatures and bolometric cor-
rections for use in HRDs for stars still on the pre-main sequence.

In this section, we therefore provide a reddening/extinction
analysis for our SFR candidate members based on recent pre-main
sequence models as opposed to dwarf star properties, and adopt
their pre-main sequence effective temperatures and bolometric cor-
rections in constructing HRDs. We subsequently compare and con-
trast the derived physical properties of our SFR candidate members
with those derived from main-sequence model parameters.

In Table B1, we present the results of the reddening/extinction
analysis, detailing wavelength-dependent vectors derived from the
Pecaut & Mamajek (2013) pre-main sequence spectral-type versus
photometric colour values. As in the case for the main sequence
analysis (see Table 4), we prefer not to derive extinction values
for those stars with negative reddening values, which occurred ﬁve
times, and once, for Chamaeleon and Rho Ophiuchus stars, respec-
tively, in the main sequence properties section. In this pre-main se-

MNRAS 000, 1–34 (2016)

quence analysis however, such cases jump to thirteen and ﬁve cases,
respectively - representing a marked increase in invalid values.

While this feature is noteworthy, it is not altogether surprising
given how photometrically variable these magnetically active stars
are (probably at the ≃ 10 per cent level). However, when one ex-
amines the difference in extinction values based on the four photo-
metric colours we employ (see Table B2), the two infrared colours
yield Av values based on E(J − H) & E(H − K) ≃ 3 − 5 times
their corresponding optical colour Av values based on E(B −V ) &
E(V − I) for Chamaeleon stars, and ≃ 4 − 10 times in the case of
the Rho Ophiuchus ensemble. This suggests that the stars are con-
siderably more red in the PMS models compared to the MS ones.
We note however that the PM13 PMS models cover the 5 − 30 Myr
age range, which encompasses a broad age range of surface stellar
conditions during this rapidly variable stage of stellar evolution.

B1 HRDs properties using PM13 colours, effective

temperatures and bolometric corrections

We re-construct our series of multi-colour HRDs using the extinc-
tion corrections (see Table B1) and bolometric corrections from the
PM13 empirically-calibrated PMS models, and perform an age-
mass analysis similar to that presented in § 3.6. The ages and
masses that we derive are detailed in Tables B3 & B4.

A comparison of stellar ages for our sample between the
KH95 and PM13 analysis reveals the following properties: (a)
Chamaeleon I and ǫ Cha stars show no difference in age; (b) For
the two former η Cha candidates, RXJ0850.1-7554 & RXJ0951.9-
7901, we present discussion in § 3.6.1 supporting the supposi-
tion that these stars are in fact likely members of the older Ca-
rina and Tuc-Hor associations, respectively. The PM13 HRD anal-
ysis, retaining a 97pc distance, conﬁrms this assertion for the
RXJ0850.1-7554 object returning an age of > 29 Myr, although
the case for RXJ0951.9-7901 is weaker. Either way, the PM13
mean age of RXJ0951.9-7901 is 16.0 ± 5.0 Myr, older than the
5-10 Myr age reported in the literature for η Cha (Lawson et al.
2001; Luhman & Steeghs 2004); (c) For the Rho Ophiuchus stars,
within the error bars, there is no discernible difference between
the KH95 and PM13 analysis. Finally, with one or two exceptions,
Chamaeleon and Rho Ophiuchus stars have stellar masses derived
in the PM13 analysis consistently 0.1 − 0.3 M⊙ lower than for the
KH95 analysis.

APPENDIX C: RESEARCH NOTES ON OBJECTS WITH
EXCESS

We have gathered below observations and notes from the litera-
ture for the seven objects which have marginal to high levels of in-
frared excess emission in their SEDs. Three of the four objects with
substantial excess have been observed by multiple other authors,
from sub-mm disc observations/modeling to detailed SED model-
ing. One object, RXJ1625.6-2613 has been relatively unobserved,
with only one set of previous H α/Li EW measurements, and its
assignation of WTTS status, having been reported (Martín et al.
1998) is at odds with our analysis (see § C4). We have compared
our isochrone-derived stellar masses with those from our SED mod-
els (see Table C1), and generally ﬁnd good agreement; the sole ex-
ception to such an agreement is RXJ1625.6-2613. In this case, our
sole model ﬁt which meets the selection criteria (deﬁned in § 4) is
subject to a degeneracy in stellar luminosity and inclination.

C1 ROXR1 13 (a.k.a DoAr 21/RXJ1626.03-2423)

Being the most extensively, and thoroughly, observed object of
our sample abundant photometric data are available for ROXR1
13. In our modeling of these data, however, we noted inconsisten-
cies likely due to variability; indeed, previous authors have noted
in the farther wavelengths speciﬁcally, there is likely contamina-

tion from nearby extended sources. ROXR1 13 was observed by
Cieza et al. (2013) with Herschel, disc excess seen in both the
PACS 70µm and 160µm bands. Their H α line proﬁle appears to
be simply in absorption, but earlier work has shown this line to
be highly variable (Jensen et al., 2009). McClure et al. (2010) ob-
tained Spitzer IRS spectra and saw PAH features. The Spitzer c2d
survey also observed this object, providing IRAC and MIPS pho-

millimeter imaging of Andrews et al. (2009) resolved a ∼37 AU
gap in the inner disc in the dust continuum, indicating some clear-
ing has taken place. We too ﬁnd that this Av > 5 object shows
clear evidence of infrared excess longward of 5µm, supporting its
class II status reported by (Andrews & Williams 2007).

For this Av > 5 object, we again ﬁnd clear evidence in its SED
of a circumstellar disc, with strong infrared excess longward of
a couple of microns. This object was also included in the survey
of Furlan et al. (2009), and based on the shallow 13-31µm spec-
tral slope, it is not likely a transition disc object. Both Furlan et al.

a − Reddening vectors are calculated by subtracting appropriate photometric colours for each target (see Table 2) from corresponding theoretical values for
pre-main sequence stars (from table 6 in Pecaut & Mamajek 2013) based on spectral types (see Table 3).
b − Extinction vectors [Av], based on four colour-dependent reddening vectors, are calculated to be: For optical data, Av=3.1×E(B − V ) and
Av=2.48×E(V − Ic) (from Bessell & Brett 1988); For infrared, Av=8.86×E(J − H) and Av=16.32×E(H − K) (from Ramírez & Meléndez 2005). For
negative reddening values, we do not calculate an extinction value.
c − Two sets of reddening and extinction values are calculated, one for each of the two spectral types.

(2009) and Manoj et al. (2011) discuss the likeliness, based on the
shallow slope in the 13-31µm window, clearing of the outer disc,
but RXJ1112.7-7637 lacks a sub-arcsecond companion that could
do it.

C4 RXJ1625.6-2613 (a.k.a. PDS 83, V* V896 Sco, CD-25

1150.4, IRAS 16225-2607)

This target has been previously observed spectroscopically by
(Martín et al. 1998), who classiﬁed as a WTTS, and detected H α
emission at the ≃ 4.6Å level as well as a strong Li I 6708Å ab-
sorption line (≃ 450 mÅ). Our UVES Li I EW measurement agree
very well with this earlier datum, but we cannot easily, directly at
least, compare our H α EWs since we measure the residual line pro-
ﬁle (observed - template), whereas the study of Martín et al. (1998)
solely measures the observed proﬁle. We note that in our UVES
spectrum however, we observe a very strong H α emission feature
(> 6.4Å), as well as indications of a wind in a redshifted self-
absorption feature of the H α feature. Similarly, Rojas et al. (2008)
also observe a very strong and complex H α emission feature in

MNRAS 000, 1–34 (2016)

this object (EW=-12.8Å) as well as compelling evidence for IRAS
infra-red emission. Furlan et al. (2009) present a SED of this object
which shows clear evidence of mid infra-red excess emission and a
conspicuous silicon feature at 10µm, consistent with circumstellar
material. For this Av > 4.5 object, our own SED shows clear ev-
idence of disc-like infrared emission; combined with the Rojas et
al. and Furlan et al. results, these observations are clearly at odds
with its Martín et al. WTTS assignment.

C5 Marginal infrared excess targets

RXJ1625.0-2508 and RXJ1623.5-2523, whose SEDs are shown in
Figure D1, were both included in the survey of Martín et al. (1998);
our Li I EW values are consistent with the earlier measurements
within error.

Luhman et al. (2012) suggest RXJ1623.1-2300 is a potential
Upper Sco member, further noting that excess in the W2 band could
mean this object has a debris or evolved transitional disc. We see
excess in W3 and W4, as well a strong, narrow H α emission fea-
ture.

Notes:
a − For each SFR target, differential Av vectors, as a function of photometric colour, are calculated by subtracting spectral type-colour dependent Av values
derived from main sequence (KH95) and pre-main sequence (Pecaut & Mamajek 2013) theoretical models.
b − Two sets of differential extinction values are calculated, one for each of the two spectral types.

C6 Remaining Av > 5 Objects

APPENDIX D: SEDS FOR FULL SAMPLE

SEDs for the two remaining Av > 5 objects, RXJ1621.2-2347 &
RXJ1624.8-2359, are consistent with bare photospheres, and out to
the WISE W4 band, exhibit essentially no infrared excess emission
whatsoever. Visual inspection of DSS optical and 2MASS infrared
images show that these two stars lie in heavily-extincted regions of
the Rho Ophiuchus SFR. We therefore posit that both systems are
WTTSs experiencing heavy in situ visual and near-infrared extinc-
tion.

For completeness, we plot the SEDs of those Chamaeleon and
Rho Ophiuchus stars that are consistent with WTTSs in Fig-
ures D2 & D3.

APPENDIX E: ANCILLARY INFRARED PHOTOMETRIC
DATA

In constructing our SEDs, we exploited mid-infrared and sub-mm
photometric datasets for the Chamaeleon and Rho Ophiuchus stars
obtained using the AKARI, Herschel, IRAM, SCUBA, Spitzer, VLA
