Intrinsic Time Quantum Gravity

Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica, Taiwan

Hoi-Lai Yu∗

Correct identiﬁcation of the true gauge symmetry of General Relativity being 3d spatial diﬀeo-
morphism invariant(3dDI) (not the conventional inﬁnite tensor product group with principle ﬁbre
bundle structure), together with intrinsic time extracted from clean decomposition of the canonical
structure yields a self-consistent theory of quantum gravity. A new set of fundamental commutation
relations is also presented. The basic variables are the 8 components of the unimodular part of the
spatial dreibein and 8 SU (3) generators which correspond to Klauder’s momentric variables that
characterize a free theory of quantum gravity. The commutation relations are not canonical, but
have well deﬁned group theoretical meanings. All fundamental entities are dimensionless; and the
quantum wave functionals are preferentially in the dreibein representation. The successful quantum
theory of gravity involves only broad spectrum of knowledge and deep insights but no exotic idea.

INTRINSIC TIME AND PHYSICS OF THE HAMILTONIAN CONSTRAINT

We had shown in[1, 2] that the symplectic potential

3 , ˜π), consisting of (one-third of) the logarithm of the determinant
can be cleanly separated into the conjugate pair, (ln q
of the spatial metric and the trace of the momentum, from (¯qij , ¯πij ), the unimodular part of the spatial metric with
traceless conjugate momentum that allows a deparametrization of the theory wherein ln q
3 plays the role of the
intrinsic time variable for β2 = l − 1
3 > 0 with l being the deformation parameter in the DeWitt supermetric;
Gijkl = 1
2 (qikqjl + qilqjk) − lqijqkl. This decomposition and identiﬁcation of the intrinsic time variable point to a
paradigm shift in the symmetries of Gravitation/space-time.
The fundamental symmetries of Einstein’s General Relativity(GR) can be revealed by carrying out its full canonical
analysis. Since space-time is not inert in Gravitation, the canonical analysis which has to be done without a ﬁxed
background had to wait until the work of Dirac[3] and Arnowitt-Deser-Misner. The 4-d metric and the action can be
expressed, essentially without loss of generality as,

1

ds2 = gµνdxµdxν = −N 2dt2 + qij(dxi + N idt)(dxj + N jdt),
S = Z dtd3x (˜πij dqij

dt − N iHi − N H) + boundary term;

wherein several important features are revealed: only the spatial or 3-metric qij is dynamical with conjugate momen-
tum ˜πij , and the ﬁelds N i and N (which are respectively called the shift and lapse functions, and they parametrize
how the same spatial point is deformed from one hypersurface to the next) play the role of Lagrange multipliers
associated, respectively, with the super-momentum Hi and super-Hamiltonian H constraints,

Hi = −2qik∇j ˜πjk (= 0),

H =

2κ
√q

[Gijkl ˜πij ˜πkl + V (qij )] (= 0),

2 and V (qij ) = − q

and for GR(l = 1
(2κ)2 [R − 2Λeﬀ ]). By the usual method of counting in canonical analysis, there are
thus 6 degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) associated with the canonical pairs (qij , ˜πij) for GR in four-dimensions, subject to
4 constraints, resulting in 2 net ﬁeld d.o.f. in the theory. The constraints and the algebra, or commutation relations
they obey (which for GR is also called the Dirac algebra) also shed light on the fundamental symmetries of the theory.
Under the action of the super-momentum constraint (also called diﬀeomorphism constraint for reasons that will soon
become clear), the fundamental variables changes by

{f (qij, ˜πij ), Hk[N k]}P.B. = L ~N f,

Hi[N i] ≡ Z N iHid3x;

i.e. by a diﬀeomorphism.

So although it is possible to interpret the constraint Hi causes the same eﬀect on the fundamental variables as
the change induced by an inﬁnitesimal general coordinate transformation, it should be emphasized that, 1)the true
symmetry of the theory is dictated by the form of the constraints and the precise transformations they generate, and
not by changes in the integration dummy spatial coordinate variable which is integrated over in both the action and
in the Hamiltonian; 2)Hi generates diﬀeomorphisms which are changes in the dynamical ﬁelds evaluated at the same
coordinate point, for instance, δ ~N qij (x) = {qij(x), Hk[N k]}P.B. = L ~N qij (x), and in this aspect there is no distinction
between usual Yang-Mills gauge transformations which are deemed ‘internal’ while GR is often naively associated
with ‘external’ or space-time coordinate transformations. What is important is that the symmetries are not realized
through ‘transformation of coordinates’ but through the transformation of ﬁelds in which the coordinate labels are
inert and play no active role. Thus as far as spatial diﬀeomorphisms are concerned, they are genuine gauge symmetries
of Einstein’s theory but with spatial metric being the basic variable and are on equal footing with usual Yang-Mills
‘internal’ gauge symmetries which describes symmetries under changes at the same coordinate point with connection
variables.

For GR, the interpretation of the changes generated by the super-Hamiltonian or Wheeler-DeWitt constraint, H,

is not so straightforward. It can be shown that

3

δN qij = {qij, H[N ]} =
δN ˜πij = {˜πij, H[N ]} =

4N κ
Gijkl ˜πkl = LN nµ qij [modulo. EOM],
√q
N
qij H − N√q(qkiqlj − qijqkl)Rkl + LN nµ ˜πij .

Thus the constraint generates diﬀeomorphism or Lie derivative, LN nµ, in the direction normal to the Cauchy surface
only on-shell on the constraint surface (i.e. when the constraints hold) and also when the equations of motion
(EOM) are imposed (which for Einstein’s theory in vacuum is the vanishing of the spacetime Ricci curvature tensor
Rµν ). This implies that in the quantum context, GR does not possess the full gauge symmetry of four-dimensional
diﬀeomorphisms, but spatial diﬀeomorphisms will remain intact. This is corroborated by the fact that the Dirac
algebra is not the algebra of 4-dimensional diﬀeomorphisms. The call to abandon 4-covariance is not new. In the
simpliﬁcation of the Hamiltonian analysis of GR, the fact that only the spatial metric is dynamical lead Dirac to
conclude that ‘four-dimensional symmetry is not a fundamental property of the physical world’[3]. In his seminal
article, Wheeler had emphasized that space-time is a concept of ‘limited applicability’, and it is 3-geometry, not
4-geometry, which is fundamental in Quantum Geometrodynamics[4].

In quantum ﬁeld theories (QFT), true gauge symmetries have clear interpretation in the canonical context in Dirac
quantization. Physical quantum states are annihilated by the constraints, and this have the direct interpretation that
the state is invariant under symmetry transformations of the fundamental conﬁguration variable. For instance in
Yang-Mills gauge theories, the Gauss Law constraint is Gb(x)Ψ[Aia] = ∇j ˆπjb(x)Ψ[Aia] = 0. Realizing the conjugate
momentum of Aia realized in the connection representation by operator, ˆπia = 
i δδAia and Taylor expansion leads to

Ψ[Aia + δgaugeAia] = Ψ[Aia] +Z (δgaugeAjb(x))

(Z ηbGbd3x)Ψ[Aai] = Ψ[Aia],

wherein δgaugeAjb = −∇jηb, together with integration by parts over compact Cauchy surface without boundary,
or with assumed vanishing of gauge parameter ηb on the boundary. This linear dependents in canonical momentum,
manifests the invariance under local gauge transformations of all physical states in QFT. In precisely the same manner
in GR, with regard to spatial diﬀeomorphisms[5],

Ψ[qij + δDiﬀeo.qij] = Ψ[qij] +Z (δDiﬀeo.qij)

HiΨ[qij] = 0. In Table 1, we enlist the diﬀerences in gauge structures between 3dDI and conventional Yang-Mills
gauge theories.

Now, one can easily see that the quadratic canonical momentum dependence of the Hamiltonian constraint will

deprive its role of generating temporal gauge transformations; but only constraints

wherein ¯H(¯πij , ¯qij , q) := p ¯Gijkl ¯πij ¯πkl + V (¯qij , q) plays the role of local Hamiltonian density that generates real

intrinsic time evolution. Although the constraints form a ﬁrst class algebra, and the lapse function N is a priori
arbitrary; classically, the physical meaning of N is ﬁxed a posteriori by the EOM and constraints[1],

Paradigm shift in the role of the Hamiltonian constraint and the identiﬁcation of intrinsic time variable from the
spatial metric collude to yield a theory of quantum gravity with underlying 3dDI gauge symmetry dictated by the
spatial metric. The physical contents of this new theory are equivalent to GR[6], however, with the great advantages
of being capable of modifying the potential, i.e. to include the conformal structures through the Cotton-York tensor
to achieve renormalizability of the theory without encountering any inconsistency in the constraint algebra.

MOMENTRIC AND COMMUTATION RELATIONS OF GEOMETRODYNAMICS

In usual quantum theories, the fundamental canonical CR, [Q(x), P (y)] = iδ(x− y), implies P

 is the generator of
translations of Q which are also symmetries of the ‘free theories’ in the limit of vanishing interaction potentials. For
geometrodynamics, the corresponding canonical CR is [qij (x), ˜πkl(y)] = i 1
iδk
j )δ(x − y). However, neither
positivity of the spatial metric is preserved under arbitrary translations in superspace generated by the conjugate
momentum; nor is the ‘free theory’ invariant under translations, because the kinetic part, Gklmn ˜πkl ˜πmn, of the
Hamiltonian dependents on qij .
In quantum gravity, states which are inﬁnitely peaked at the ﬂat metric, or for
that matter any particular metric with its corresponding isometries, cannot be postulated ad hoc; consequently, the
underlying symmetry of even the ‘free theory’ is obscure. The Poisson brackets for the barred variables are,

the metric representation, the implementation of ¯πkl as traceless, symmetric, and self-adjoint operators is problematic.
Remarkably, these diﬃculties can be cured by passing to the ‘momentric variable’ (ﬁrst introduced by Klauder[7])
which is classically ¯πi
j = ¯qjm ¯πim. In terms of spatial metric and momentric variables, the fundamental CR postulated
(from which the classical Poisson brackets corresponding to (2) can be recovered) are then[8]
