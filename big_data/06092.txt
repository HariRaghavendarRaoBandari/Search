ABSTRACT

We investigate the occurrence of slipping magnetic reconnection, chromospheric evaporation, and
coronal loop dynamics in the 2014 September 10 X-class ﬂare. The slipping reconnection is found to
be present throughout the ﬂare from its early phase. Flare loops are seen to slip in opposite directions
towards both ends of the ribbons. Velocities of 20–40 km s−1 are found within time windows where
the slipping is well resolved. The warm coronal loops exhibit expanding and contracting motions
that are interpreted as displacements due to the growing ﬂux rope that subsequently erupts. This
ﬂux rope existed and erupted before the onset of apparent coronal implosion. This indicates that
the energy release proceeds by slipping reconnection and not via coronal implosion. The slipping
reconnection leads to changes in the geometry of the observed structures at the IRIS slit position,
from ﬂare loop top to the footpoints in the ribbons. This results in variations of the observed velocities
of chromospheric evaporation in the early ﬂare phase. Finally, it is found that the precursor signatures
including localized EUV brightenings as well as non-thermal X-ray emission are signatures of the ﬂare
itself, progressing from the early phase towards the impulsive phase, with the tether-cutting being
provided by the slipping reconnection. The dynamics of both the ﬂare and outlying coronal loops is
found to be consistent with the predictions of the standard solar ﬂare model in 3D.

INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares are local energetic and even explosive phe-
nomena within the solar atmosphere, exibiting a fast in-
crease of radiation throughout the electromagnetic spec-
trum (e.g., Kane 1974; Fletcher et al. 2011; White et al.
2011) as well as a wealth of dynamic phenomena includ-
ing ejections of material into the interplanetary space
(e.g., van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989; Dere et al. 1999;
Amari et al. 2000; Moore et al. 2001; Green & Kliem
2009; Green et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2012; Patsourakos
et al. 2013; van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. 2014). A ﬂare typ-
ically involves nearly all local regions of the solar atmo-
sphere, from the chromosphere to the transition region
and the corona. The ﬂare emission originates dominantly
in hot ﬂare loops with temperatures above 10 MK, an-
chored in bright chromospheric ribbons (e.g., Schmieder
et al. 1996a; Warren & Warshall 2001; Fletcher et al.
2011; Graham et al. 2011; Reid et al. 2012; Young et al.
2013; Inglis & Gilbert 2013; Dud´ık et al. 2014b; Doschek
et al. 2015).

The energy powering solar ﬂares is believed to be re-
leased via the mechanism of magnetic reconnection (e.g.,
Dungey 153; Parker 1957; Sweet 1958; Priest & Forbes

2000; Zweibel & Yamada 2009), which is a process in-
volving mutual annihilation of oppositely-oriented com-
ponents of magnetic ﬁeld lines.
In the standard solar
ﬂare model in 2D, sometimes called the CSHKP model
(Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp
& Pneuman 1976) the reconnection happens at the mag-
netic null-point, where the magnetic ﬁeld is locally zero.
Oppositely oriented ﬁeld lines are brought together by
ﬂows into the vicinity of the null-point, where they re-
connect. The post-reconnected magnetic ﬁeld forms a
growing system of ﬂare loops and the erupting ﬂux rope.
This model succeeds in explaining many ﬂare phenom-
ena (e.g., Shibata et al. 1995; Tsuneta 1997; Shibata &
Tanuma 2001), such as plasma heating and particle ac-
celeration. Nevertheless, this 2D model fails to explain
the inherently 3D properties of ﬂares, such as the shear
of ﬂare loops and its strong-to-weak evolution during the
course of the ﬂare (Aulanier et al. 2012), movements of
EUV or X-ray sources along chromospheric ﬂare ribbons
(e.g., Tripathi et al. 2006; Chifor et al. 2007; Inglis &
Gilbert 2013), or the morphology of ﬂare ribbons that
are often seen as a J-shaped structure (e.g., Chandra
et al. 2009).

To remedy this, the standard solar ﬂare model has been
extended into 3D in the recent years (Aulanier et al.
2012, 2013; Janvier et al. 2013). This standard solar
ﬂare model in 3D is a presureless MHD model that in-
cludes a torus-unstable magnetic ﬂux rope (T¨or¨ok et al.
2004; Aulanier et al. 2010) located in a generic sigmoidal
solar active region (see also Green & Kliem 2009; Tri-
pathi et al. 2009; Savcheva et al. 2012a,b, 2014). Since
the ﬂux rope is unstable, it undergoes an eruption as
the result of the torus instability. The restructuring of
the magnetic ﬁeld during the rise and eruption of the ﬂux
rope involves the development of a current sheet beneath

2

Dud´ık et al.

the ﬂux rope, where the magnetic reconnection can pro-
ceed. However, in this 3D model the current layer does
not originate in the vicinity of a magnetic null-point (or
any other topological discontinuity) as in the 2D CSHKP
model. Rather, the current layer is associated with the
quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs; Priest & D´emoulin 1995;
D´emoulin et al. 1996; Titov et al. 2002), where the mag-
netic connectivity has strong gradients, but is still con-
tinuous. It has been found that the photospheric traces
of such QSLs correspond well with the observed ﬂare
ribbons (e.g., D´emoulin et al. 1997; Savcheva et al. 2015;
Zhao et al. 2016). The distortion of the magnetic ﬁeld
within the QSLs gives rise to electric currents paral-
lel to the magnetic ﬁeld (Masson et al. 2009; Wilmot-
Smith et al. 2009) thereby fulﬁlling the necessary condi-
tion for magnetic reconnection in 3D (Hesse & Schindler
1988). Reconnection within the QSLs is of a slipping
nature: local rotation of the magnetic ﬁeld and the con-
tinuous exchange of connectivities of neighbouring ﬁeld
lines within the coronal diﬀusive region induce apparent
velocity of the entire reconnecting ﬁeld line (Priest &
D´emoulin 1995; Priest et al. 2003; Aulanier et al. 2006).
This process is exhibited as an apparent slipping mo-
tion of the ﬁeld line footpoints in the photospheric QSL
traces. Since the QSLs generalize the concept of separa-
trices, which are true topological discontinuities within
the magnetic ﬁeld, the slipping reconnection in QSLs is a
generalized mechanism of magnetic reconnection in 3D.
The standard solar ﬂare model in 3D, featuring the
slipping reconnection, has so far withstood several im-
portant observational tests. Aulanier et al. (2012) found
that the observed strong-to-weak shear transition of the
ﬂare loop arcade can be explained by the original shear of
the reconnecting coronal loops, as well as the stretching
eﬀect of the erupting ﬂux rope that decreases the shear
of ﬁeld lines reconnecting higher up in the solar atmo-
sphere. Using photospheric vector magnetograms, Jan-
vier et al. (2014) identiﬁed the photospheric footprints
of the 3D coronal electric current layer and found that
these match well the observed ﬂare ribbons, in agreement
with the model. The slipping motion of individual ﬂare
loops, reported ﬁrst by Dud´ık et al. (2014b), was found
to match the model-predicted morphology and dynam-
ics of slipping magnetic ﬁeld lines. The slipping motion
was however observed predominantly in one direction,
toward the hook (elbow) of the ﬂare ribbon away from
the inversion line. This slipping motion was also found
to contribute to the buildup of the erupting ﬂux rope, as
well as possibly to smaller magnetic structures formed in
the current layer such as plasmoids that are manifested in
the radio emission (e.g., Kliem et al. 2000; Ko(cid:32)loma´nski &
Karlick´y 2007; Karlick´y et al. 2002, 2010; Karlick´y 2014;
Nishizuka et al. 2015). Since the ﬁrst report, occurrence
of the slipping reconnection was reported in several ﬂares
(Li & Zhang 2014, 2015). However, the standard solar
ﬂare model in 3D predicts slipping motion of both the
ﬂare loops and the ﬂux rope ﬁeld lines. Therefore, the
slipping motion motion should be observed in both di-
rections along both ﬂare ribbons: ﬂux rope ﬁeld lines
slipping towards the hooks, while the ﬂare loops slip in
the opposite direction toward the straight part of the
ribbons. The latter motion in the opposite direction has
however been largely absent in the observational reports
so far (Dud´ık et al. 2014b; Li & Zhang 2014, 2015).

In addition to slipping motion, solar ﬂares exhibit
many other dynamic phenomena such as the occurrence
of precursors before the impulsive phase (e.g., Bumba &
Kˇrivsk´y 1959; Harrison et al. 1985; Harrison 1986; F´arn´ık
& Savy 1998; F´arn´ık et al. 2003; Sterling & Moore 2005;
Chifor et al. 2006, 2007), the evaporation of chromo-
spheric plasma ﬁlling post-reconnection ﬁeld lines (e.g.,
Neupert 1968; Raftery et al. 2009; Milligan & Dennis
2009; Brosius & Holman 2010; Del Zanna et al. 2011a;
Ning 2011; Graham et al. 2011; Doschek et al. 2013;
Young et al. 2013, 2015; Polito et al. 2015; Tian et al.
2015; Graham & Cauzzi 2015), and also the dynamics
of neighbouring coronal loops, including loop expansion,
contraction, and oscillations (e.g., Liu et al. 2009; Liu
& Wang 2009, 2010; Liu et al. 2012b; Sun et al. 2012;
Gosain 2012; Sim˜oes et al. 2013; Shen et al. 2014; Imada
et al. 2014; Kushwaha et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015).
These phenomena have not been studied in relation to
the standard solar ﬂare model in 3D. The dynamics of
coronal loops is of special interest, since contracting mo-
tions are interpreted in terms of the coronal implosion
conjecture (Hudson 2000). Coronal implosion is a pro-
posed mechanism for the release of magnetic energy, pro-

portional to (cid:82) B2dV , by the decrease of the associated

coronal volume V and the associated drop of magnetic
pressure. Since the rate of coronal loop contraction was
found to be closely associated to the hard X-ray and
microwave emission of the ﬂare (Sim˜oes et al. 2013), the
coronal implosion can be interpreted as an energy release
mechanism (Hudson 2000; Sim˜oes et al. 2013) alternative
to magnetic reconnection. We note however that the im-
plosion is sometimes interpreted only as a response to
the energy release (Russell et al. 2015).

In this paper, we investigate the slipping reconnection
and chromospheric evaporation in the ﬂare from its onset
well before the impulsive phase, together with their con-
nection to the precursors and the expanding/contracting
motions of the overlying corona. To do this, we examine
observations of the 2014 September 10 X-class solar ﬂare
(event SOL2014-09-10T17:45). This event has been stud-
ied already by several authors (Li & Zhang 2015; Cheng
et al. 2015; Tian et al. 2015; Graham & Cauzzi 2015;
Zhao et al. 2016). They focused on its impulsive phase
including the slipping reconnection (Li & Zhang 2015),
chromospheric evaporation (Tian et al. 2015; Graham &
Cauzzi 2015), as well as the presence of magnetic ﬂux
ropes being built by tether-cutting reconnection before
the ﬂare (Cheng et al. 2015), and the calculation of the
QSLs including their photospheric traces and compari-
son to observed ﬂare ribbons (Zhao et al. 2016). How-
ever, each of these authors studied only separate aspects
of the ﬂare.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we re-
port on the observations of the ﬂare performed mainly by
the Solar Dynamics Observatory, including an analysis
of the coronal loop dynamics and the apparent slipping
motion of ﬂare loops. Section 3 deals with the character-
istics and evolution of chromospheric evaporation dur-
ing the ﬂare as observed by IRIS in connection to the
slipping reconnection. The observational results are dis-
cussed with respect to the standard solar ﬂare model in
3D in Sect. 4. There, the relation of precursor signatures
to the slipping reconnection is discussed. Conclusions are

2. THE X1.6-CLASS FLARE AS OBSERVED BY SDO/AIA

2.1. AR 12158 and the pre-ﬂare state

The Active Region NOAA 12158 (hereafter, AR 12158)
was visible on the solar disk during 2014 September 03–
16. During this time, the AR 12158 produced several
ﬂares, including 12 C-class ones, an M4.6-class ﬂare on
2014 September 7, and an X1.6-class long-duration ﬂare
on 2014 September 10.
It is this X-class ﬂare that is
studied in this paper.

The X-class ﬂare itself started at about 16:47 UT,
reached maximum of its X-ray ﬂux at 17:45, as mea-
sured in the 1–8˚A passband by the GOES-15 satellite at
Earth, and exhibited a long gradual phase (Fig. 1, top).
Several speciﬁc aspects of the ﬂare have already been re-
ported on by diﬀerent authors (Li & Zhang 2015; Tian
et al. 2015; Cheng et al. 2015). The ﬂare evolution is
detailed in Sect. 2.2.

The pre-ﬂare state of the AR 12158 is shown in Fig. 1.
The leading positive-polarity sunspot is encircled by a
wreath of several smaller ones of both polarities, with
the negative-polarity pores located to the S, SW, and W
of the spot. The magnetic conﬁguration of this active
region is peculiar, since the leading sunspot is of positive
and not negative polarity, as would be expected of an
active region in the northern solar hemisphere during the
cycle 24.

The AR 12158 contains two ﬁlaments, F1 and F2, as
shown by the chromospheric Hα observations obtained at
the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), see Fig. 1. The
ﬁlaments are of the same chirality (see, e.g., Martin 1998;
DeVore et al. 2005). Both these ﬁlaments are overlaid
by a sigmoid visible only in the 94 ˚A channel (Cheng
et al. 2015) of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA,
Lemen et al. 2012; Boerner et al. 2012) onboard the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO,Pesnell et al. 2012). This
suggests that the temperature of the sigmoid corresponds
to the formation of Fe XVIII (i.e., about 7 MK; O’Dwyer
et al. 2010; Del Zanna 2013). The X1.6-class ﬂare occurs
within this sigmoid (Fig. 2).

2.2. Flare evolution

In this section, we describe the evolution of the ﬂare,
as observed by the SDO/AIA imager. AIA acquires full-
Sun images in 10 EUV and UV ﬁlters with high spatial
resolution (1.(cid:48)(cid:48)5, 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)6 pixel size) as well as high temporal
resolution (12 s). The bandpasses of the AIA ﬁlters are
centered on several strong lines in the solar EUV/UV
spectrum. These emission lines originate at diﬀerent
plasma temperatures, with some ﬁlter bandpasses con-
taining more than one strong emission line (e.g., O’Dwyer
et al. 2010; Del Zanna et al. 2011b). This means that
the AIA temperature responses are multithermal in gen-
eral (see also, e.g., Del Zanna 2013; Schmelz et al. 2013).
That is, the signal observed within a particular AIA ﬁl-
ter can originate at several diﬀerent temperatures. Using
combinations of AIA ﬁlters however, it is possible to iden-
tify the approximate temperature of the emitting plasma,
as well as to perform the diﬀerential emission measure re-
construction (Schmelz et al. 2011a,b; Warren et al. 2012;
Hannah & Kontar 2012, 2013; Del Zanna 2013; Schmelz
et al. 2013; Dud´ık et al. 2014b, 2015). This makes the

AIA instrument an excellent tool to study the morphol-
ogy of plasma emission at diﬀerent temperatures.

As an example of the multithermality of the AIA ﬁl-
ters relevant to the present study, we point out that the
131 ˚A bandpass has two dominant contributions, from
Fe VIII and Fe XXI, arising at about 0.5 and 10 MK
respectively in equilibrium conditions (see, e.g., Petkaki
et al. 2012; Del Zanna 2013; Dud´ık et al. 2014b). The
Fe VIII emission can be discerned visually by compar-
ison with the 171 ˚A bandpass, dominated by Fe IX
formed at around 0.8 MK. This is because of the sig-
niﬁcant overlap of the peaks of the relative ion abun-
dances of Fe VIII and Fe IX under equilibrium condi-
tions (Dere et al. 2009; Bryans et al. 2009). Under non-
equilibrium conditions characterized by the presence of
κ-distributions with high-energy power-law tails, as is
the case in ﬂaring plasma (Kaˇsparov´a & Karlick´y 2009;
Oka et al. 2013, 2015), the AIA temperature responses
become more multithermal, and the peaks of the temper-
ature responses are shifted towards higher temperatures
(Dzifˇc´akov´a et al. 2015).

A timeline of individual events during the ﬂare is given
in Table 1. An overview of AIA observations of the ﬂare
is given in Fig. 2, and in the online Movies 1, 2, and 3,
corresponding to the ﬁlters 131 ˚A, 171 ˚A, and 304 ˚A,
respectively. The 131 ˚A and 171 ˚A bandpasses are cho-
sen since they allow us to distinguish the 10 MK ﬂare
emission from the warm coronal loops. The 304 ˚A band-
pass is shown to depict the evolution of the ﬁlaments F1
and F2, as well as that of the ﬂare ribbons. The ribbons
are denoted PR and NR for the positive-polarity and
negative-polarity ribbons, while PRH and NRH stand
for the respective hooks of these ribbons. Note that the
presence of hooks is a signature of the presence of a ﬂux
rope as also evidenced by the sigmoid (Aulanier et al.
2012; Janvier et al. 2013, 2014; Dud´ık et al. 2014b), and
also F1 and F2 (see also Cheng et al. 2015).

2.2.1. Early ﬂare phase

The X1.6-class ﬂare starts with a loop-like brightening
within the sigmoid above F1. The brightening is observ-
able in 131 ˚A and 94 ˚A bandpasses and develops into
a series of ﬂare loops. This behaviour is very similar
to the one described for another X-class ﬂare by Dud´ık
et al. (2014b). At 16:50 UT, these loops are clearly vis-
ible (Fig. 2, top left). At this time, F2 starts to rise
and brighten in both 131 ˚A and 171 ˚A, indicating that
it is heated to at least several times 105 K. The F2 sub-
sequently decelerates as it is stopped by the overlying
coronal loops seen in AIA 171 ˚A and 193 ˚A (see Fig. 2 at
17:00 UT and online Movie 2). To study the evolution of
F2 and the neighbouring coronal loops, we place an ar-
tiﬁcial cut across a direction of F2 rise (see Fig. 2). The
time-distance plots obtained along the direction of this
cut are shown in Fig. 3. Using these time-distance plots,
we measure the deceleration of F2 to be about −14 m s−2
by approximating a parabola to the proﬁle on the time-
distance plot (dashed black line in Fig. 3). The stopping
of F2 is denoted by the black horizontal dotted line in
the 171 ˚A time-distance plot.

The time-distance plots constructed along the artiﬁ-
cial cut also reveal rich dynamics of the overlying warm
coronal loops observed in the 171 ˚A bandpass as well as

in 193 ˚A (not shown). These loops are highly likely to
have been inclined with respect to the local vertical; note
also the similar pattern of ﬁbrils observed in Hα and AIA
304 ˚A(Figs. 1, bottom left and 2, right). One of the coro-
nal loops observed in 171 ˚A is contracting with a speed of
about −2.9±0.9 km s−1. It is located at the approximate
position of 100(cid:48)(cid:48) along the artiﬁcial cut, and denoted
by the white dotted line in the respective 171 ˚A time-
distance plot (Fig. 3). The contraction is discernible even
before the onset of F2 rise, an important fact discussed in
terms of the coronal implosion mechanism in Sect. 2.2.3.
The rise of F2 is also accompanied by widespread dy-
namics of the coronal loops. A series of these loops start

to rise at various times with diﬀerent velocities, rang-
ing from 5.8±1.7 to 21.4±2.1 km s−1 (see Fig. 3). The
velocities are determined by calculating the slope of the
respective line on a time-distance plot. The location of
the line is determined by trial-and-error method repeated
many times. The uncertainty is then calculated by error
propagation from the uncertainties of the line endpoints.
We consider that the uncertainty in position is equal to
half of the AIA resolution (0.(cid:48)(cid:48)75), while the uncertainty
in time is half of the AIA cadence (0.6 s).

The rising of the warm coronal loops in our ﬂare con-
tinues until the eruption and the associated disturbance
during the impulsive phase. We however note that the
occurrence of a contracting loop before the presence of

2.2.2. Eruption of the ﬂux rope

After 17:10 UT, a system of growing S-shaped ﬂare
loops occurs in the same location as the previous failed
eruption of F2 (X ≈ 0(cid:48)(cid:48), Y ≈ 180(cid:48)(cid:48), Figs. 2 and 3.) These
loops are observed in AIA 131 ˚A and 94 ˚A, but not in
171 ˚A, indicating that their temperature reaches 10 MK,
similarly as reported in Dud´ık et al. (2014b). This sys-
tem of hot S-shaped loops subsequently accelerates to
about 270 km s−1 in the projected velocity as measured
by the time-distance technique along the cut (Fig. 3, top),
and erupts in the NW direction after 17:24 UT (Table
1, Fig. 2). A growing halo of an EIT wave is observed
in the other AIA channels (see Movie 2). The erup-
tion also manifests itself as the impulsive phase, a com-
mon behaviour for the eruptive ﬂares (e.g., Moore et al.
2001; Zhang et al. 2001, 2012; Cheng et al. 2013, 2014a,b;
Dud´ık et al. 2014b). Subsequently, the ﬂare reaches its
maximum X-ray ﬂux at 17:45 and enters into the gradual
phase (Fig. 1), during which the ﬂare loops exhibit the
strong-to-weak shear transition (Aulanier et al. 2012).

During the eruption, the neighbouring warm coronal
loops are pushed and accelerated by the eruption of the
hot S-shaped loops, (white long-dashed lines in Fig. 3), a
behaviour reported also by Zhang et al. (2012) and Cheng
et al. (2013). The interesting feature here is that the
acceleration is non-linear (see also Cheng et al. 2014a),
as we were unable to approximate the observed proﬁle
with a parabola. The white long-dashed line shown in
the 171 ˚A time-distance plot in Fig. 3 correspond to a
third-order polynomial approximation of the accelerated
front.

We interpret this eruption of hot loops as the erup-
tion of a ﬂux rope (see Zhang et al. 2012; Cheng et al.
2013, 2014a,b; Dud´ık et al. 2014b). In terms of the stan-
dard solar ﬂare model in 3D, the hot eruption represents
the post-reconnection envelope of the torus-unstable ﬂux
rope whose core is invisible in AIA bands (see Sect. 4.4
of Dud´ık et al. 2014b, for another such case).
In this
ﬂare, the situation is further complicated by the presence
of two distinct, underlying ﬁlaments, F1 and F2, one of
which (F2) undergoes a preceding failed eruption, while
the ﬁlament F1 stays unperturbed, i.e., does not erupt
during the entire ﬂare similar to cases discussed in Dud´ık
et al. (2014b) and Dalmasse et al. (2015). During the im-
pulsive phase, F1 is bordered by both ﬂare ribbons, NR
and PR (see Fig. 2, rows 4–5 ), while during the gradual
phase later on, F1 is overlaid by the cooling ﬂare loops,
already brightening in the AIA 304 ˚A channel.

Based on the observed morphology with two ﬁlaments
and an S-shaped hot envelope of the erupting magnetic
ﬂux rope, the magnetic conﬁguration during the erup-
tion is likely that of a double-decker ﬂux rope (Liu et al.
2012a; Kliem et al. 2014; Cheng et al. 2014b). The upper
deck consists of the ﬂux rope undergoing the torus insta-
bility together with its post-reconnection envelope con-
stituted by the S-shaped hot loops, similar to the MHD
model with a single ﬂux rope, see Aulanier et al. (2010,
Fig. 10 therein), Aulanier et al. (2012), Savcheva et al.
(2012a), and Dud´ık et al. (2014b). The lower deck con-
sists of F2 and possibly also F1. The F2 erupts before the
upper deck, similar to the model of Kliem et al. (2014),
while F1 stays unperturbed and is later overlaid by the
ﬂare loops. The failed eruption of F2 suggests that F2 is

rising structures in our ﬂare is contrary to the behaviour
reported for ﬁve diﬀerent ﬂares by Liu et al. (2012b).

During the rise of F2, the system of ﬂare loops con-
tinue to widen and brighten (Fig. 2), while individual
ﬂare loops exhibit apparent slipping motion in both their
footpoints. The slipping motion is clearly visible in the
online Movie 1 and is analyzed in Sect. 2.3.

Slipping Reconnection, Chromospheric Evaporation, Implosion, and Precursors in X-class Flare 7
as well as the corresponding position of 50(cid:48)(cid:48) on the time-
distance plots in Fig. 3 are both located closely to the
onset of fast eruption, visible after 17:24 UT.

2.2.3. Apparent implosion and oscillations of the warm

coronal loops

After the onset of the fast eruption, the warm coronal
loops exibit oscillations with a typical period of several
minutes (Fig. 3). These oscillating loops are observed
in 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, and 211 ˚A. They occur after about
17:30 UT, i.e., after the onset of the impulsive phase,
and extend into the ﬂare maximum at 17:45 UT. At this
time, after several periods, the oscillations have mostly
damped. In our case, the onset of oscillations following
the hot eruption is observed without a preceding strong
contraction phase, reported for other event by Sim˜oes
et al. (2013), and interpreted as a coronal implosion (see
Hudson 2000).

Here, we point out that the oscillations and the asso-
ciated change in loop position occur only after the onset
of the fast eruption (see Fig. 2). Together with the rising
of some of the coronal loops observed prior to the erup-
tion, this indicates that the oscillations are a result of the
displacement of the position of the coronal loops due to
the large-scale dynamics of the magnetic ﬁeld during the
ongoing slipping magnetic reconnection (Sect. 2.3) and
the ﬂux rope eruption. Since the hot ﬂux rope (10 MK
as evidenced by AIA 131 ˚A) exists and is built before
and during the eruption, the loop oscillations are not the
result of a coronal implosion, a mechanism for energy re-
lease proposed by Hudson (2000). Rather, the apparent
“implosion” accompanying the loop oscillations (see also
Sim˜oes et al. 2013) is a behaviour driven by the large-
scale dynamics of the magnetic ﬁeld during the ﬂux rope
eruption.
Instead, the observation of a contracting loop with a
speed of −2.9±0.9 km s−1 may be a better candidate
for the coronal implosion, since this contraction starts
around the beginning of the ﬂare (but before F2 rise).
However, the 12 s cadence of the AIA observations to-
gether with its spatial resolution do not allow us to un-
ambiguously determine the exact time of the onset of
this contraction. Similarly, determination of the onset
of ﬂare-related reconnection from AIA 131˚A data is pre-
cluded by the limited cadence and the presence of back-
ground emission at coronal temperatures. We note that
the timescales needed for ﬁlling of the ﬂare loops with
dense enough hot plasma in AIA 131 ˚A due to limited
velocities chromospheric evaporation, of the order of sev-
eral hundreds of km s−1 (see, e.g., Graham et al. 2011;
Young et al. 2013, 2015; Doschek et al. 2013; Brosius
2013; Polito et al. 2015; Tian et al. 2014, 2015; Graham
& Cauzzi 2015), represent an additional complication.

Because of these limitations, it is not possible to de-
termine whether this contraction of a single loop starts
before the onset of the ﬂare reconnection, or vice versa.
This is in contrast to the behaviour reported by Shen
et al. (2014), where the peripheral coronal loops started
contracting only after the onset of their ﬂare. Neverthe-
less, if the contraction is a signature of a coronal implo-
sion, in our ﬂare it is a very weak signature of only a
single loop structure. It seems unlikely that this single
and quite localised structure can account for the overall

a ﬂux rope rather than a sheared arcade. The magnetic
structure of F1 is less certain.
It could be either an-
other ﬂux rope or simply located in dips induced by the
upper deck. Nevertheless, the present situation is more
complex than the previous observational reports of the
double-decker ﬂux ropes in Liu et al. (2012a) and Cheng
et al. (2014b) or the modeling performed by Kliem et al.
(2014), where the two ﬂux ropes corresponding to both
decks are located in the same plane. In our event, this
might arise as a consequence of the complex photospheric
ﬂux distribution (see Sect. 2.1 and Fig. 1, top right). The
situation is further complicated by the fact that only F2,
but not F1, undergoes a failed eruption.

The temporal evolution of the emission of F2 and the
following hot eruption suggest that F2 is ﬁrst heated to
coronal temperatures. This is indicated by F2 being a
bright feature in both AIA 131 ˚A and 171 ˚A (Fig. 3)
from about 16:56 UT, when the F2 decelerates during
the failed eruption. The brightening then subsequently
fades away. Following that, at about 17:10 UT, the grow-
ing system of S-shaped hot loops is observed with a pro-
jected velocity of ≈38.2 km s−1. At about 17:20 UT, the
system of the growing S-shaped loops reaches the posi-
tion of the halted F2 indicated by the black horizontal
dotted line in the 171 ˚A time-distance plot. Since at this
time F2 is faint, we are not able to discern whether the
ﬁlament material returned to lower heights by ﬂowing
along its legs, or whether F2 merged with the erupting
hot S-shaped loops of the same chirality (see also, De-
Vore et al. 2005), i.e., the upper deck. The overlap of
the dotted line at the position of about 50(cid:48)(cid:48) in the AIA
171 ˚A time-distance plot with the growing S-shaped loops
in 131 ˚A at about 17:15 – 17:20 UT (Fig. 3) indicates that
at least a partial merging of F2 with the erupting upper-
deck ﬂux rope is a possibility (c.f., Kliem et al. 2014).
We note however that in another ﬂare, merging of two
ﬂux ropes and the associated presence of the hot plasma
has already been reported by Joshi et al. (2014), while
Karlick´y & B´arta (2011) have shown that the merging of
two plasmoids (representing ﬂux ropes in 2D) can lead
to particle acceleration, heating, and X-ray emission.

The evolution of the ﬂare emission and its morphology
suggests that the breakout-type reconnection (see, e.g.,
Antiochos et al. 1999; Sterling & Moore 2004a,b; Lynch
et al. 2004, 2008) is not the primary cause of the rise of
F2 and the subsequent hot eruption. This is since (1) the
ﬂare and the associated rearranging of the neighbouring
warm coronal loops starts even before the initiation of
F2 rise, and that (2) the three lobes required in breakout
in a quadrupolar geometry are not identiﬁable in our
ﬂare. Therefore, we propose that the ﬂare is driven by a
tether-cutting reconnection building the upper, erupting
ﬂux rope, (as argued already by Cheng et al. 2015), with
a transition to an ideal MHD (torus) instability of the
erupting ﬂux rope (c.f., Aulanier et al. 2010, 2012; Inoue
et al. 2014, 2015), and a feedback between the instability
and reconnection (Savcheva et al. 2012b). It is possible
that this transition occurs after the merging of F2 and
the hot ﬂux rope. Such merging, entailing reconnection
or ﬂux transfer between the lower and upper ﬂux ropes,
could lead to an increase of ﬂux and twist in the upper
ﬂux rope, which may thereby render it unstable. This
scenario is supported by the fact that the time 17:20 UT,

ﬂare dynamics; furthermore, the energy release during
the ﬂare increases strongly with time, but there are no
corresponding signatures of accelerating implosion. On
the contrary, the contraction of this loop is no longer
detectable at 17:10 UT, well before the impulsive phase.
The onset of loop oscillations after the eruption is con-
nected with a modulated radio signal detected by the
Callisto radio spectrometer (Benz et al. 2009; Monstein
2013) network station at the Birr castle in Ireland. This
network station measures linearly polarized solar radio
ﬂux in the horizontal direction. In Fig. 3 bottom, we show
the lightcurve at the frequency of 350 MHz, smoothed
with a 2 s boxcar to reduce the noise. The signal shows
an increase from about 17:07 UT, a spike at 17:25:40 UT,
and then two strong maxima at about 17:28:20 UT and
17:32:30 UT. A weaker third maximum occurs at about
17:38 UT. The spike occurs approximately at the onset
of the fast eruption. The following maxima appear to be
in phase with the oscillating loops detected in the AIA
171 ˚A time-distance plot at the cut position of ≈160(cid:48)(cid:48),
see Fig. 3. To our knowledge, this is a ﬁrst possible detec-
tion of loop oscillations modulating the solar radio ﬂux.
It is however not clear at present why the amplitudes of
these maxima are diﬀerent.

2.3. Slipping reconnection during the ﬂare

The occurrence of the apparently slipping ﬂare loops
in this ﬂare has already been reported by Li & Zhang
(2015), who focused on the NR during the impulsive
phase (from about 17:25 onwards) in the vicinity of the
IRIS slit. Upon reviewing the evolution of the AIA
131 ˚A observations, we found that the slipping recon-
nection is present during the entire ﬂare. It is noticeable
from the very beginning at about 16:50 UT through the
impulsive phase, similarly as in Dud´ık et al. (2014b). The
following gradual phase is characterized by the strong-
to-weak shear transition, which can also be explained by
the standard solar ﬂare model in 3D (see Aulanier et al.
2012). We also note that Zhao et al. (2016) calculated
the photospheric traces of the QSLs in an extrapolated
non-linear force-free ﬁeld (Gilchrist & Wheatland 2014)
and found that these correspond well with the observed
shape of the ﬂare ribbons, thus indirectly supporting the
idea of slipping reconnection occurring in QSLs.

Unlike the ﬂare reported in Dud´ık et al. (2014b) how-
ever, we note that the early ﬂare phase analyzed here
exhibits several instances of apparent counter-motions of
slipping ﬂare loops. That is, the sytem of ﬂare loops ex-
hibit apparent slippage in both directions toward both
ends of the developing ribbons. These apparent counter-
motions are not easy to track however, mainly due to
the complicated evolution of the ribbons. For example,
the NR exhibits local squirming motions, during which
the slipping motion is seen to proceed even in an almost
transversal direction with respect to the general direc-
tion of the ribbon extension during the next few minutes
(see the online Movies 1 and 4). A similar, but less pro-
nounced evolution happens in the PR. Nevertheless, the
apparent slipping motions of ﬂare loops can be discerned
during particular time intervals. Two such cases are re-
ported on in the remainder of this section.

2.3.1. Slipping reconnection along the NR

An example of the squirming nature of the evolution of
the NR and the associated slipping reconnection can be
seen in the online Movie 4 and the corresponding Fig. 4,
where the time interval of 17:08 – 17:17 UT is shown. Al-
though the NR generally extends in the south-west di-
rection, which is the same direction as reported during
the impulsive phase by Li & Zhang (2015), during the
time interval shown in Fig. 4, the slipping motion occurs
predominantly in the north-south direction. To analyze
these slipping motions, we place an artiﬁcal cut at So-
lar X =−150(cid:48)(cid:48) (see Fig. 4, top left). This cut is used
to produce the time-distance plots in AIA 131 ˚A and
304 ˚A shown in Fig. 5. We chose these two AIA ﬁlters,
since the 131 ˚A shows the slipping loops emitting Fe XXI,
while the corresponding footpoints are very bright in the
304 ˚A, making it a useful bandpass to study the evolution
of the ribbon itself.

At about 17:03 UT, the footpoints of the apparently
slipping loops ﬁrst reach the location of the cut. The
dominant slipping motion is in the southern direction,
with a speed of about −38 km s−1. This velocity cor-
responds to the leftmost dashed line in Fig. 5. Several
other slipping loops enter the cut later on. Some of
them are highlighted by the dashed and dotted lines in
Fig. 5. After 17:09 UT, a prominent extension of the rib-
bon in the opposite (northern) direction occurs at the
position of Solar Y = 110(cid:48)(cid:48). Following this time, a series
of loops is seen to be apparently slipping in both direc-
tions along the cut.
In Fig. 5, the apparently slipping
loops are denoted by dotted lines, while the apparently
slipping bright knots in the ribbon are denoted by dashed
lines. The distinction between the two is easily made by
their presence in both the 131 ˚A and 304 ˚A time-distance
plots. This is because the 304 ˚A passband shows only the
ﬂare loop footpoints, with higher portions of these ﬂare
loops being visible in 131 ˚A and not in 304 ˚A. The typi-
cal apparent slipping velocities found are 11 – 57 km s−1,
similar as in Dud´ık et al. (2014b).

We next examined the relationship between the mor-
phology of ﬂare emission in the hot AIA bandpasses
(131 ˚A and 94 ˚A) and the bandpasses registering the
transition-region emission (304 ˚A, 1600 ˚A, as well as
1700 ˚A). We note that the 304 ˚A bandpass is nearly co-
temporal with the 131 ˚A, with only a 1 s diﬀerence. We
ﬁnd nearly a one-to-one correspondence (Fig. 4) between
the locations of the footpoints of the 131 ˚A loops and the
304 ˚A bright kernels within the evolving ribbon. Several
conspicuous examples are pointed out by Arrows 1–5 in
Fig. 4. This relationship was already reported by Dud´ık
et al. (2014b) and is conﬁrmed here.

The nearest 1600 ˚A or 1700 ˚A image is usually taken
at least several seconds earlier or later compared to the
131 ˚A (Fig. 6). The close relationship between the
131 ˚A footpoints and the 304 ˚A bright kernels also holds
for the kernels observed in AIA 1600 ˚A. An example is
shown in Fig. 6. This ﬁgure contains the AIA 1600 ˚A and
1700 ˚A observations, as well as their ratio, for the ﬁve
last times shown in Fig. 4. We see that the bright-
est kernels in 304 ˚A are also present in 1600 ˚A, with
faint brightenings being present in the 1700 ˚A band-
pass as well. The ribbon is however best seen in the

a nearby plage and ≈3.8 compared to a quiet Sun re-
gion containing both network and internetwork. This
result points to a strong C IV emission being present
in the ﬂare kernels. Strong increase of transition-region
line intensities is commonly observed in a solar ﬂare
(e.g., Cheng et al. 1981; Poland et al. 1982; Woodgate
et al. 1983; Schmieder et al. 1996b; Del Zanna & Woods
2013), often associated with hard X-ray bursts. Note
that a strong increase of C IV emission is expected for
non-Maxwellian distributions (Dzifˇc´akov´a et al. 2005;
Dzifˇc´akov´a & Karlick´y 2008), however, without direct
RHESSI observations, or modeling of the optically-
thick photospheric continuum, the presence of these non-
Maxwellians cannot be unambiguously conﬁrmed from

We note that both the 1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A band-
passes have broad spectral response (see Fig. 9 in Boerner
et al. 2012).
These bandpasses contain a strong
contribution from the photospheric continuum being
formed near the temperature minimum region. The
1600 ˚A bandpass however also contains the prominent
C IV 1548.19˚A and 1550.77˚A doublet. By taking the AIA
1600 ˚A / 1700 ˚A ratio, we ﬁnd that the locations of the
bright ﬂare kernels show strongly enhanced 1600 ˚A emis-
sion, up to a factor of ≈3.3 compared to the average of

in Fig. 7. These loops exhibit converging motion until
about 17:19 UT, after which time they are no longer vis-
ible. The corresponding velocities along the curvilinear
cut (see Fig. 8) are −37.5 ± 10.9 km s−1 and 31.2 ± 5.0
km s−1 for the loops denoted by the white and orange ar-
row, respectively. Another loop, denoted by a green ar-
row, is seen to be slipping from about 17:18 UT onwards.
Its velocity along the curvilinear cut, corresponding to
the green dotted line in Fig. 8, is 19.0 ± 3.7 km s−1.

Generally, the slipping velocities measured using the
time-distance technique during the early ﬂare phase
(16:50 – 17:30 UT) are in the range of 18–44 km s−1. This
is is consistent with the apparent slipping velocities de-
termined for the NR in Sect. 2.3.1. We however note
that the apparent slipping velocities measured here are
only lower limits because of the changing angle of the
loops with respect to the cut due to the evolution of the
ribbon itself.

2.3.2. Slipping reconnection along the PR

The slipping reconnection including the apparent mo-
tion of ﬂare loops in both directions is best visible in
the vicinity of the PR, located near the leading positive-
polarity sunspot. An example of evolution of the ﬂare
loops is given in the online Movie 5 and the corresponding
Fig. 7, where the interval of 17:16 – 17:20 UT is shown.
The ﬁrst part of this image shows the AIA 131 ˚A, while
the second part shows the corresponding AIA 304 ˚A im-
ages.
It can be seen that the one-to-one relationship
between the footpoints of the ﬂare loops as seen in AIA
131 ˚A and the bright kernels in 304 ˚A is conﬁrmed for
the PR as well.

To identify the apparently slipping loops in both direc-
tions along the developing ribbon, we produced a time-
distance plot along a curvilinear cut shown in Fig. 7. This
cut has the shape of an ellipse, centered on the location
X =−63.5(cid:48)(cid:48), Y = 152(cid:48)(cid:48). The elliptical shape of the cut re-
ﬂects approximately the shape of the ribbon PR and was
determined as the best-ﬁt to the manually placed knot
points using a trial-and-error method. Using a curvi-
linear cut is necessary, since a straight cut would only
allow a measurement of one velocity component along
the ribbon, and could lead to signiﬁcant underestimates
depending on the position along a straight cut.

The time-distance plot along this cut is shown in Fig. 8.
The slipping motion spans nearly the entire pre-ﬂare
phase. Several well-deﬁned slipping loops are denoted by
the dotted lines. At several times, loops are observed to
slip in both directions along the cut. We note especially
that in the vicinity of the position 60(cid:48)(cid:48) along the cut, a
series of loops is observed to slip apparently in succes-
sively changing directions, creating a “criss-cross” pat-
tern. The apparent velocities of these loops are approxi-
mately 30 km s−1. In particular, a pair of ﬂare loops slip-
ping in opposite directions is observable at about 17:17–

Since its launch in 2013, the Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS, De Pontieu et al. 2014) has provided
simultaneous imaging and spectroscopy of the solar at-
mosphere with unprecedented spatial resolution, (0.33(cid:48)(cid:48)–
0.4(cid:48)(cid:48)), cadence (up to 2 s) and spectral accuracy (allowing
measurements of Doppler shifts of ≈3 km s−1). The IRIS
Slit Jaw Imager (SJI) acquires high resolution images in
four diﬀerent passbands (C II 1330 ˚A , Si IV 1400 ˚A,
Mg II k 2796 ˚A and Mg II wing 2830 ˚A), allowing
to study the plasma dynamics in great details. Simul-
taneously, the IRIS spectrograph (SP) observes several
emission lines formed over a broad range of tempera-
tures (log(T )[K] = 3.7 − 7). Of particular interest is the
Fe XXI 1354.08 ˚A line formed at ≈ 11 MK, which rep-
resents the only ﬂare emission observed by IRIS. This
spectral line was ﬁrst identiﬁed by Doschek et al. (1975)
in solar ﬂare spectra obtained with the Naval Research
Laboratory’s S082B spectrometer on board Skylab.

Fe XXI line allow us to investigate the plasma response
to the heating during ﬂares and provide new insights
into the chromospheric evaporation process. Spatially
resolved, blueshifted asymmetric Fe XXI proﬁles indica-
tive of plasma upﬂows ≈ 200 km s−1 were ﬁrst observed
by Mason et al. (1986) during the impulsive phase of dif-
ferent ﬂares with the UVSP instrument on board the So-
lar Maximum Mission. In contrast, 1D hydrodynamics
simulations of a single ﬂare loop (Emslie 1978) predict
that entirely blueshifted proﬁles should be observed at
the onset of the ﬂare. However, these early observations
lacked good spatial information and the discrepancy can
be explained by interpreting the asymmetric proﬁles as a
superposition of diﬀerent plasma upﬂows from diﬀerent
sub-resolution locations along the line of sight.

Recently, there has been a lot of interest in studying
the Fe XXI emission during ﬂares as observed with the
unprecedented resolution of IRIS (e.,g. Young et al. 2015;
Tian et al. 2015; Graham & Cauzzi 2015; Polito et al.
2015, 2016). One of the important ﬁnding from these
recent studies is that the Fe XXI is observed to be en-
tirely blueshifted during the impulsive phase of the ﬂare,
suggesting that the sites of evaporation are now likely to
be resolved by IRIS.

On 2014 September 10, IRIS was running a ﬂare watch
observation of the AR 12158 from 11:28 UT to 17:58 UT.
Therefore, it captured the ﬂare from onset well into the
gradual phase. The observing mode was sit-and-stare
with an exposure time of 8 s and a total cadence of 9.4 s
for the FUV channel. The slit of the IRIS spectrograph
(SP) crossed two locations along the ribbon NR during
all the impulsive and part of the gradual phase of the
ﬂare (see Fig. 2). The Slit-Jaw Imager (SJI) obtained
19 s cadence images in the 1400 ˚A and 2796 ˚A passbands
over a ﬁeld of view of 119(cid:48)(cid:48) × 119(cid:48)(cid:48) on the Sun. For each
spectrograph exposure, one context SJI image was pro-
vided alternatively in one of the two ﬁlters. In this work,
we focus on the O I and Si IV spectral windows included
in the spectrograph FUVS and FUVL channels, respec-
tively. We used IRIS level 2 data, obtained from level
0 after ﬂat-ﬁeld, geometry calibration and dark current
subtraction. The cosmic rays removal was performed by
using the SolarSoft routine despik.pro.

As a result of the temperature variation of the detec-
tors during the IRIS satellite orbit, the FUV channel
wavelength scale drifts by about 8 km s−1 during one or-
bit. The orbital variation was corrected by using the

strong O I 1355.60 ˚A line neutral line included in the
FUVS CCD. The Doppler shift of this line is often less
than 1 km s−1 and thus represents a suitable reference
line for wavelength calibration purposes. We measured
the periodic variation of the O I line position over time
and subtracted it from both FUVS and FUVL wave-
length arrays, assuming that the same wavelength cor-
rection can be applied for diﬀerent FUV CCD channels,
(IRIS TN20 1). The absolute wavelength calibration can
then be obtained by using the strongest photospheric
lines in the same spectral range. For the FUVS channel,
the absolute correction was given by the diﬀerence be-
tween the O I line position (after the orbital correction)
and the expected rest wavelength 1355.5977 ˚A (Sandlin
et al. 1986). For the FUVL CCD, the S I 1401.51 ˚A neu-
tral line can be used. Even though this line is usually
very weak, during this event it was visible at the ribbon
location throughout the impulsive phase.

An overview of the ﬂare evolution as observed by IRIS
is shown in Fig. 9. Section 3.2 provides a detailed de-
scription of the ﬂaring plasma dynamics as observed in
the Fe XXI emission. The O IV and Si IV lines are re-
ported on in Sect. 3.3.

3.2. Fe XXI 1354.10 ˚A observation

The evolution of the ﬂare as observed by IRIS is shown
in Fig. 9. In this ﬁgure, each row captures a particular
time, showing (from left to right) the AIA 131 ˚A together
with the closest IRIS SJI 1400 ˚A images, as well as the
corresponding O I and Si IV detector images. The IRIS
SJI 1400 ˚A band is dominated by Si IV 1402.77˚A emis-
sion at log(T /K)≈ 4.9 K. Therefore, the sequence of SJI
images in Fig. 9 shows the morphology of the low tem-
perature ribbon emission over time. The corresponding
Fe XXI spectra are reported in Fig. 10, as observed by
the IRIS spectrograph slits. The line centroid and width
given by the Gaussian ﬁt are plotted in each spectrum.
The expected width of the Fe XXI line observed by
IRIS is ≈ 0.43 ˚A, given by the quadratic sum of the
IRIS instrumental FWHM (0.026 ˚A; De Pontieu et al.
(2014)) and the line thermal width as estimated in CHI-
ANTI v7.1 (Dere et al. 1997; Landi et al. 2013), as-
suming an ion formation temperature of 11 MK. How-
ever, the line width is typically observed to be signiﬁ-
cantly larger during the impulsive phase of ﬂares (Ma-

We note that the IRIS O I spectral window includes
some cool temperature lines whose emission is usually en-
hanced during ﬂares and can blend with the Fe XXI. Sev-
eral authors, i.e., Young et al. (2015), Polito et al. (2015),
Tian et al. (2015), and Graham & Cauzzi (2015) reported
a detailed identiﬁcation of these lines during diﬀerent
ﬂare events. The most important blending is represented
by the chromospheric C I line at 1534.3 ˚A (Mason et al.
1986). However, the proﬁles of these low-temperature
lines are typically narrow and in most of the cases they
can be easily separated from the broad Fe XXI emission.
The ﬁrst row of Fig. 9 shows the ﬂare plasma at around
17:00 UT, in the early ﬂare phase. At this time, we
observe ﬂare loops connecting the two ﬂare ribbons in
the AIA 131 ˚A channel. These are not visible in the
171 ˚A AIA passband (Fig. 2) and therefore are likely to
be hot loops originating from the Fe XXI 128.75 ˚A emis-
sion contributing to the 131 ˚A band. We note that at this
time, IRIS does not detect any Fe XXI 1354.10 ˚A emis-
sion. When there is a ﬂare, the Fe XXI 128.75 ˚A line
dominates the 131 ˚A band (O’Dwyer et al. 2010; Petkaki
et al. 2012), the corresponding count rates detected in
the IRIS Fe XXI 1354.07 ˚A line are about 100 times less
than the count rates detected in the 131 A band. This is
despite the fact that the forbidden Fe XXI 1354.07 ˚A line
emits 1.2 more photons than the resonance 128.75 ˚A line.
For example, at 17:03 UT, the peak counts in the AIA
131 ˚A band are about 1100 DN s−1, which are equivalent
to about 12 DN s−1 in the IRIS Fe XXI line. This esti-
mate was obtained from a full DEM analysis using the six
AIA bands via the Hannah & Kontar (2013) method and
the current understanding of the in-ﬂight degradation of
the IRIS channels. The IRIS study had an exposure time
of 8 s, so 100 DN in the line correspond to about 5 DN in
the peak value above the continuum, close to the limit of
the line being observable, given that the line is normally
very broad and blended (cf., Fig. 10).
The Fe XXI line is ﬁrst observed by IRIS only from ≈
17:03 UT (second row of Fig. 9) onwards, during which
time the intensity of the ﬂare plasma in the 131 ˚A AIA
band becomes more intense. At the location of the IRIS
slit, the Fe XXI emission originates in upper portions
of the hot ﬂare loops visible in the AIA image as the
slit cuts these ﬂare loops near their centre. A spectrum
of the IRIS Fe XXI line at ≈ 17:03:12 UT is shown in
in the ﬁrst panel of Fig. 10. The line proﬁle has been
obtained by averaging over the slit pixels between the
horizontal blue lines indicated in Fig. 9. At 17:03 UT, the
intensity of the Fe XXI emission is very weak, around 10
DN (data numbers). The line proﬁle appears almost at
rest (10 km s−1) and is slightly broadened with a width of
0.56 ˚A, corresponding to a non-thermal width of around
48 km s−1.

The red contours overlaid on the AIA and SJI im-

ages represent the intensity contours (70 and 90 % of
the maximum value) of the 6-12 keV sources observed by
RHESSI (Lin et al. 2002) during 17:02:48 – 17:03:00 UT.
These sources coincide with the footpoints of the hot
loops rooted in the two ﬂare ribbons, as expected from
the thick-target ﬂare heating model (Brown 1971). Un-
fortunately, we are not able to identify any X-ray sources
at 17:15 UT onwards because of the spacecraft night.
At 17:14 UT, we observe blue-shifted (≈90 km s−1)
Fe XXI emission in the IRIS O I detector image as shown
in the third panel of Fig. 9. At this time, the IRIS slit
was crossing a bright portion of the ribbon NR visible in
both the SJI 1400 ˚A ﬁlter and the AIA 131 ˚A bandpass.
This portion of the ribbon corresponds to footpoints of
a series of hot ﬂare loops connecting PR and NR. That
is, the IRIS Fe XXI emission is now formed at a ribbon
rather than at loop top, meaning that the local magnetic
ﬁeld along which the Fe XXI emission originates is more
vertical than at 17:03 UT. The corresponding Fe XXI
spectrum, shown in the second panel of Fig. 10, is indeed
more strongly blue-shifted. We note that the observation
of the Fe XXI emission during the early phase of the ﬂare
(see Table 1) has not been reported in the previous stud-
ies of the same ﬂare event by Tian et al. (2015); Graham
& Cauzzi (2015), which were concerned with the analysis
of the strong blueshifts observed from around 17:25 UT
onwards.

From about 17:25 UT, i.e., during the start of the im-
pulsive phase characterized by the onset of the fast erup-
tion (Fig. 3), the IRIS slit crosses the NR ribbon at two
diﬀerent locations. Strong Fe XXI emission is detected
only at the northern crossing with the NR ribbon, lo-
cated at around Solar Y ≈ 120(cid:48)(cid:48). The line proﬁle is
plotted in the third panel of Fig. 10. The Gaussian ﬁt
shows a strong blue shifted centroid position of about
200 km s−1 and a very broad line width (≈0.81 ˚A or a
non thermal width of ≈ 90km s−1). Few minutes later at
about 17:31 UT, we observe a line proﬁle which is even
more blue shifted (≈270 km s−1) and extends outside the
O I spectral window, as reported by Tian et al. (2015)
and Graham & Cauzzi (2015).

In summary, the Fe XXI line is at ﬁrst weakly blue-
shifted and few minutes later becomes more shifted as
the ribbon NR enters the position of the IRIS slit. We
interpet this as the consequence of the slipping recon-
nection along the NR that is itself developing. We note
that although the 1D hydrodynamical simulations of a
ﬂare loop predict a rapidly increasing blue shift before
the maximum blue shift velocity is reached (Fisher et al.
1985; Polito et al. 2016), this is strictly true only for one
ribbon kernel.
In the observations, this eﬀect is com-
pounded by the observed slipping motion of the ﬂare loop
footpoints, which are responsible for the changing incli-
nation of the local magnetic ﬁeld at the position of the
IRIS slit. Therefore, the evaporating plasma would show
diﬀerent Doppler shifts along the line of sight. Unfortu-
nately, in the present study we cannot reliably distin-
guish between the geometric eﬀects and the evolution of
the evaporation velocities itself. This is due to the lack
of the stereoscopic spectral observations.

In addition, we note that the Fe XXI blue-shifted emis-
sion is located a few pixels just above the ribbon position
where the intensity of the FUV continuum and the cooler

16

Dud´ık et al.

emission lines is enhanced, as already observed by Young
et al. (2015) in the study of another X-class ﬂare. This
can be best seen in the third and fourth panels of ﬁgure
9, showing that the blue lines (indicating the location
of the Fe XXI blueshifts) are clearly above the position
where transition region lines included in the Si IV win-
dow are more intense. We note however that such non-
cospatiality of only several IRIS pixels would not have
been resolved by AIA, whose spatial resolution is 1.5(cid:48)(cid:48).
Therefore, the conclusion reached in Sect. 2.3 that the
AIA ribbon as seen in 304 ˚A is cospatial with the foot-
points of the 131 ˚A loops remains valid within the AIA
resolution.

Later on during the ﬂare, the Fe XXI line proﬁle gradu-
ally moves to the rest-position as the ﬂare loops are being
ﬁlled by the high temperature evaporating plasma. The
fourth panel in Fig. 10 shows the Fe XXI spectrum being
almost at rest as observed by the IRIS slit at around
17:48 UT, i.e., after the onset of the gradual phase.

3.3. O IV and Si IV lines

The O IV 1401.16 ˚A, O IV 1399.77 ˚A and
Si IV 1402.77 ˚A transition lines observed by IRIS pro-
vide various diagnostic opportunities, but are aﬀected
by several complexities in their interpretation. The re-
sponse of these transition-region lines in the ribbons dur-
ing a ﬂare is well-known to be strongly dependent on
non-equilibrium ionization eﬀects (Bradshaw et al. 2004;
Doyle et al. 2013; Olluri et al. 2013) as well as on the non-
Maxwellian electron distributions (Dud´ık et al. 2014a).
These lines can also be blended with unidentiﬁed photo-
spheric or chromospheric transitions (Polito et al. 2016)
during the impulsive phase.

The O IV emission is usually very low in active re-
gion spectra but can be enhanced during the impulsive
phase of ﬂares. Here, we have estimated the ratio be-
tween the O IV 1401.16 ˚A and Si IV 1402.77 ˚A lines
at particular times where the O IV emission was high
enough to be reliably measured. The Si IV line is often
saturated during the impulsive phase and thus only an
upper limit of the ratio can be obtained. We have in-
tegrated the line intensity after background subtraction
and calibrated the values in physical units (erg s−1 sr−1
cm−2 ˚A−1). For instance, at 17:30:17 UT we ﬁnd a ratio
of O IV 1401.16 ˚A and Si IV 1402.77 ˚A equal to 0.03
at the slipping footpoint of the NR crossed by the IRIS
slit at that time (see Movie 6). Similar values are found
throughout the impulsive phase.

In addition, the ratio of the O IV 1401.16 ˚A and
1399.77 ˚A lines IRIS is sensitive to the electron den-
sity of the plasma. Throughout the impulsive phase of
the ﬂare we measure a O IV ˚A1401.16 / 1399.77 ˚A ratio
which is below the high density limit of 2.5 reported by
CHIANTI v7.1, assuming equilibrium condition. In par-
ticular, the ratio is equal to 2.19 at 17:30:07 UT, and
would indicate a density of at least 1012 cm−3 in equi-
librium. These line ratios are also consistent with lower
densities and non-Maxwellian electron distributions in
the ﬂare plasma (Dud´ık et al. 2014a).

4. DISCUSSION

Having demonstrated that the occurrence of slipping
reconnection is not inconsistent with a presence of a

wide range of dynamical phenomena during the ﬂare, in-
cluding chromospheric evaporation, hard X-ray emission,
loop expansion, contraction, and oscillations, as well as
the occurrence of eruptions, we now discuss these obser-
vations both in terms of the standard solar ﬂare model
in 3D of Aulanier et al. (2012) and Janvier et al. (2013),
as well as in the light of previous observational results
and clues.

4.1. Expanding and contracting loops in the standard

solar ﬂare model in 3D

We ﬁrst examined the standard solar ﬂare model in
3D for signatures of loop expansion and contraction. Al-
though this model is generic and its photospheric ﬂux
distribution does not represent the active region under
study here, we found that both processes are present.
In Fig. 11, the ﬂux rope is depicted by pink, green, and
cyan ﬁeld lines. The pink ﬁeld lines represent the ﬂux
rope core, while the green and cyan ﬁeld lines represent
the S-shaped envelope that is created as a result of the
slipping reconnection (Aulanier et al. 2012; Janvier et al.
2013; Dud´ık et al. 2014b). The loops overlying the ﬂux
rope are shown in red and white. The white loops are
highly inclined, while the red ones are nearly vertical.
Both of these loops systems are anchored in the lead-
ing positive-polarity spot in the model (see also Aulanier
et al. 2012).

During the course of the eruption, the unstable ﬂux
rope pushes the red overlying loops, causing them to
expand and move sideways. This behaviour persists
for several tens of Alfv´en times. Although the sim-
ulation is dimensionless (Aulanier et al. 2012; Janvier
et al. 2013), taking an order-of-magnitude estimate of
the Alfv´en speed vA ≈ 103 km s−1, and the loop length of
100 Mm, the duration of the expansion would be about
103 s, in broad agreement with the observed duration of
the loop expansion during the slow rise of the ﬂux rope.
Contrary to the red ﬁeld lines, the highly inclined white
ﬁeld lines undergo a contraction. This is probably be-
cause the stretching of the legs of the ﬂux rope during
its eruption leads to a local decrease of magnetic pressure
in the legs the ﬂux rope, leading to a contraction of the
neighbouring loops.

The expanding and contracting behaviour which we
have observed is therefore consistent with the predictions
of the standard solar ﬂare model in 3D. This also con-
ﬁrms our earlier conclusion (Sect. 2.2.3) that the coronal
implosion does not occur during this ﬂare.

Finally, the observed oscillatory behaviour of the ﬁeld
lines (Sect. 2.2.3) after the fast eruption is not reﬂected
in the simulation. The reason for this is the relative
shortness of the calculation that does not allow the ﬂux
rope to leave far enough for the overlying loops to have
time to reach and bounce from the central part of AR.
Additionally, the viscosity in the model may be too large
in the locations of the loops, where the computational
mesh is stretched.

4.2. Connectivity norm in ﬂare-related QSLs

The standard solar ﬂare model in 3D also predicts that
the apparent slipping velocities of the magnetic ﬁeld lines
vslip and the outward velocity of the conjugate ribbon

to the polarity inversion line, are related. The relation
is linear, with a proportionality constant given to a ﬁrst-
order approximation by N , the local norm of the ﬁeld
line mapping

vslip = N vQSL ,

(1)

see Eq. (4) in Janvier et al. (2013).

In principle, this equation permits measurement of N
if vslip and vQSL are known, at least within a time scale
where the QSLs are not so much evolving. In this work,
we have measured the vslip during the early and impulsive
ﬂare phase and found that this velocity is typically ≈20–
40 km s−1 in both ribbons (Sect. 2.3).

To estimate the vQSL, we have ﬁrst determined the
evolution of the Solar Y position of the ribbon NR at
the location of the IRIS slit (Fig. 12). This is done dur-
ing the time interval 17:25 – 17:40 UT, i.e., during the
impulsive phase, when the ribbon is well deﬁned. The
locations of both the northern and the southern branch
of the NR are determined as the locations of maximum
intensity of the FUV continuum as observed in the FUVS
O I and FUVL Si IV spectral windows. Using the IRIS
spectra at a given sit-and-stare slit position has the ad-
vantage of a very high cadence of about 9 s compared
to the IRIS SJI or AIA images. The ribbon displace-
ments determined using this method are not subject to

confusion between the motion of the ribbon itself and
the slipping motion, which would need to be separated
out if the ribbon position were determined from imag-
ing data. The position of both branches of the NR rib-
bon shows a linear trend during the impulsive phase of
the ﬂare, as shown in Fig. 12. The projected velocity
vQSL,proj along the IRIS slit is about 19 km s−1 for the
northern branch of the NR, and has a similar value for
the southern branch. The outward ribbon velocity is
then obtained as vQSL = vQSL,proj / sin(α), where α≈ 41◦
is the approximate angle between the northern branch
of the NR and the IRIS slit at 17:30 UT (Fig. 9). This
yields vQSL ≈ 29 km s−1.
Using these values, from Eq. 1 we obtain N ≈ 0.7–
1.4, which is very low for a QSL. Even using the highest
reported value of vslip = 200 km s−1 for this ﬂare (Tian
et al. 2015) would yield only N ≈ 6.9. This poses a sig-
niﬁcant problem, since the typically expected value for
a QSL would be at least several tens or hundreds due
to the high squashing of the magnetic ﬂux-tubes in the
QSL (Titov et al. 2002). The presence of a QSL and the
associated current density enhancement (Masson et al.
2009; Wilmot-Smith et al. 2009) is a necessary condition
for the occurrence of slipping reconnection.

Why do we then detect the apparent slipping motion of

18

Dud´ık et al.

speed slightly outside of the QSL, which may have al-
ready passed to an adjacent location.

Furthermore, the vslip determined from the apparent
motion of a ﬂare loop may not represent the slipping ve-
locities of a single ﬁeld line footpoint, which could even
be super-Alfv´enic (Aulanier et al. 2006, 2012; Janvier
et al. 2013). Rather, the observed slow, sub-Alfv´enic
slipping velocities may be an illusion resulting from vari-
able rate of the energy deposition to the chromosphere
as a result of many slipping ﬁeld lines along the ribbon.
In any case, large, super-Alfv´enic slipping velocities are
out of the reach of current observations, which only have
cadence of the order of 10 s. Sub-second temporal resolu-
tion would be needed to distinguish fast slipping motion.
An additional complication is that large vslip would result
in lower energy deposition per unit time and unit area
of the ribbon, resulting in less evaporated plasma, i.e.,
fainter loops. We note that faint near-vertical stripes are
present in the time-distance plots in Figs. 5 and 8. E.g.,
a short, near-vertical strip is located at 17:03:40 UT at
the position Solar Y = 100–103(cid:48)(cid:48) in Fig. 5. Nevertheless,
the 12 s cadence of AIA does not permit measurement of
the velocity of such an intermittent stripe.

the ﬂare loops and low values of N ? In a strict sense, Eq.
(1) is valid only for a given ﬁeld line in a given instant in
time, with one footpoint anchored in one polarity-related
QSL moving at speed vQSL, while the opposite moving
end moves in the conjugate ribbon at speed vslip, with
each quantity deduced on a short timescale, as the pro-
ﬁle of the local norm N varies strongly along and across
the QSL (see Fig. 10d in Janvier et al. 2015). It is dif-
ﬁcult to ﬁnd a satisfactory relation between the analyt-
ical expression in its strict sense and the present data
as both speed quantities are obtained only as averages
over multiple locations, multiple times and multiple ﬁeld
lines, which are themselves anchored in diﬀerent sections
of the QSL photospheric footprints. This is diﬃcult to
avoid as the remote-sensing observations generally rely
on plasma emission, which in optically thin conditions
is always dominated by dense(r) plasma. While the
Eq.
(1) is only valid strictly for a given ﬁeld line in
a given instant in time, in the observations there also
exists a time delay between the energy deposition in
the ribbon and the ﬁlling of the ﬂare loops by hot and
dense evaporated plasma.
Indeed, in Sect. 3.2, it was
found that the Fe XXI blue-shifted emission observed by
IRIS is not exactly co-spatial with the ribbon as seen in
transition-region Si IV emission or the FUV continuum
(Fig. 9). Therefore, we may be measuring the slipping

4.3. Relation of the precursors to the slipping

reconnection

Slipping Reconnection, Chromospheric Evaporation, Implosion, and Precursors in X-class Flare19

Chifor et al. (2007) studied the precursor activity be-
fore major ﬂares and found that distinct, localized X-
ray brightenings occur 2–50 minutes before the onset of
the impulsive phase. These brightenings occured within
10(cid:48)(cid:48) of the polarity inversion line (PIL) and had both
a thermal and non-thermal component as observed by
RHESSI. Typically, these X-ray brightenings had also
an EUV counterpart observed either by SoHO/EIT (De-
laboudini`ere et al. 1995) or TRACE (Handy et al. 1998).
The main energy release in the impulsive phase occured
to within 50(cid:48)(cid:48) of the locations of the preﬂare brighten-
ings. Furthermore, the ﬁlament eruption began at the
location of the preﬂare brightenings that also coincided
with the presence of emerging or cancelling ﬂux. Chi-
for et al. (2007) interpreted these as the signatures of
tether-cutting mechanism (e.g., Moore & Roumeliotis
1992; Moore et al. 2001, 2011; Fan 2012) triggering the
main ﬂare and the eruption.

Inspecting the HMI and AIA 304 ˚A data, we ﬁnd that
all these observational characteristics are present during
the early ﬂare phase at approximately 16:50–17:20 UT. A
weak X-ray emission is detected in the 6–12 keV channel
by RHESSI, an example of which was shown in Fig. 9
at 17:03 UT. The advantage of IRIS and SDO/AIA is
that they oﬀer a good temperature coverage of the solar
atmosphere from the chromosphere upwards, including
ﬂaring plasmas. The SJI 1400˚A together with the AIA
1600˚A, 1700˚A, 304 ˚A, and 171 ˚A images reveal that the
EUV brightenings occur within the ribbons involved in
the main ﬂare. In fact, these EUV brightenings are the
ﬁrst instances of the ribbon development (similarly as in
Dud´ık et al. 2014b), with a one-to-one correspondence to
footpoints to the ﬂare loops exhibiting apparent slipping
motion (Sect. 2.3). This leads us to conclude that at
least for the ﬂare studied here, the precursors are in fact
signatures of the ﬂare itself, progressing from its early
phase towards the impulsive phase. This is in line of the
results of F´arn´ık & Savy (1998) who concluded that for
the preﬂare events (precursors) cospatial with the main
ﬂare, the soft X-ray emission is present with the same
size, shape, and orientation at least 5 minutes before the
onset of the impulsive phase.

Furthermore, the standard solar ﬂare model in 3D of
Aulanier et al. (2012) and Janvier et al. (2013) predicts
explicitely that the slipping reconnection creating the
ﬂare loops and building the ﬂux rope is the tether cut-
ting mechanism itself. An important distinction however
is (see Sect. 5 of Aulanier et al. 2012) that this tether-
cutting does not trigger the eruption itself as in the car-
toon of Moore et al. (2001); rather, it contributes to the
building of the ﬂux rope which then erupts via the torus
instability. We note that the presence of tether-cutting
reconnection was already suggested independently for
this event by Cheng et al. (2015), who analyzed AIA
and IRIS Si IV, C II, and Mg II observations.

The mechanism of the slipping reconnection and
tether-cutting is represented in the cartoon shown in
Fig. 13. This is essentially a 3D representation of the
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in the standard solar ﬂare
model in 3D, including the dynamics during the erup-
tion of a ﬂux rope (see also Janvier et al. 2015, Fig. 11
therein). The ﬂux rope is represented by dash-dotted
purple lines.
It is anchored in each polarity in the

hooked region of the ﬂare ribbons (red), corresponding
to the photospheric signature of the QSLs and the cur-
rent density volume, represented in purple. The QSL
wraps around the ﬂux rope, with the hyperbolic ﬂux
tube, where the connectivity distortion is the highest,
extending underneath the ﬂux rope. Magnetic ﬁeld lines
entering this high current density volume reconnect suc-
cessively in the slipping manner. Pairs of such ﬁeld lines
undergoing successive reconnections are represented by
colored ﬁeld lines in Fig. 13: Blue and yellow ﬁeld lines
have ﬁxed footpoints in the positive and negative rib-
bons, respectively. Their reconnection counterparts are
shown in green and orange, whose footpoints are again
ﬁxed in positive and negative ribbons, respectively. The
blue ﬁeld line slip-reconnected with the orange ﬁeld line.
The consequences are represented with the moving end
of the blue ﬁeld line in the negative polarity, away from
the PIL and towards the legs of the ﬂux rope. The slip-
reconnected counterpart of this blue ﬁeld line is the or-
ange one, represented with a ﬁxed footpoint anchored
in the negative polarity in the left part of the cartoon.
Its conjugate footpoint in the positive polarity is slip-
ping and is accompanied by ﬂare kernels moving toward
the PIL. The other reconnecting pair are the yellow and
green ﬁeld lines, whose one footpoint is ﬁxed in the nega-
tive and positive ribbon, respectively, while the conjugate
footpoints move along the conjugate ribbons (Fig. 13).
Together, these four ﬁeld lines create motions towards
both ends of both ribbons. This important prediction of
the model is vindicated by the observations reported on
in Sect. 2.3. These observations are in contrast to the
ﬁrst report of slipping motion of ﬂare loops in another
ﬂare (Dud´ık et al. 2014b), where the slipping motion was
observed to be predominantly in one direction, towards
the hooks of ribbons.

These successive reconnections represented in the car-
toon in Fig. 13 come to an end when the two ﬁeld lines
have gone across the current density volume. The orange
ﬁeld line becomes a low-lying ﬂare loop, while the blue
ﬁeld now wraps around the erupting ﬂux rope and be-
comes its envelope, likely observed as the hot S-shaped
erupting loop. The slippage is likely accompanied by par-
ticle acceleration in the reconnecting region. These par-
ticles propagate along each successively connected ﬁeld
line. Deposition of energy in the chromosphere is seen
as the kernel brightenings. These slipping brightenings
(Figs. 4 and 7), corresponding to the precursors in the
early ﬂare phase, are shown as bright patches appear-
ing at diﬀerent times at diﬀerent positions along both
ribbons.

In summary, the precursor activity as a result of the
tether-cutting reconnection is fully consistent with the
standard solar ﬂare model in 3D. The presence of the
apparent slipping motion during the precursor phase,
clearly identiﬁed here as such for the ﬁrst time, is the tell-
tale signature uniting the precursors and the 3D model.

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have reported on the observations of the 2014
September 10 X-class ﬂare and the occurrence of slip-
ping reconnection, large-scale dynamics of coronal loops,
as well as the chromospheric evaporation and precursors.
Our main conclusions are:

20

Dud´ık et al.

1. The apparent slipping motion occurs throughout
the ﬂare from the onset of the early phase at about
16:50 UT. This phase has not been studied in pre-
vious publications on this ﬂare. The characteris-
tic velocities of individual apparently slipping loops
are 11–57 km s−1, typically 20–40 km s−1 indepen-
dently of the ribbon. The slipping reconnection
proceeds in both directions along both ribbons,
fullﬁlling the prediction of the standard solar ﬂare
model in 3D. This is in contrast to the reports
of Dud´ık et al. (2014b) for another X-class ﬂare,
where the slipping motion was predominantly in
one direction, towards the hooks of both ribbons.
We point out however that the model-predicted ap-
parent slipping velocities are faster, well out of the
reach of the current instrumentation.
It remains
to be seen whether such fast velocities exist, or are
reduced by some dissipative processes.

2. The evolution of the ribbon NR is complex, as it
exhibits squirming motions, during which the slip-
ping motion proceeds in almost transversal direc-
tion to the direction of the ribbon extension at the
later time.

3. The ribbons observed by AIA 304 ˚A, 1600˚A,
and 1700˚A correspond to the footpoints of the
131 ˚A ﬂare loops exactly. We found that in
the bright kernels within the ribbon, the AIA
1600˚A signal can be enhanced by more than a fac-
tor of 3 compared to the AIA 1700˚A, probably due
to the strong C IV component. In the IRIS spectra,
the strong Si IV intensities and the relatively weak
O IV lines, together with the O IV ratios indicate
high densities (above 1012 cm−3). More detailed
studies are needed to conﬁrm this.

4. A failed eruption of the ﬁlament F2 is followed by
an eruption of hot S-shaped loops observed in the
AIA 131 ˚A channel at the same location later on.
This eruption shows non-linear acceleration to pro-
jected velocities of more than 270 km s−1. We in-
terpret this as an eruption of a double-decker ﬂux
rope, where the lower deck consists of the F2 and
possibly also F1. The F2 which undergoes a failed
eruption with possible ﬂux transfer to the upper
deck, which is visible as the erupting hot S-shaped
loops. In terms of the standard solar ﬂare model
in 3D, these S-shaped loops represent the envelope
of the torus-unstable erupting ﬂux rope, fed by the
ongoing slipping reconnection.

5. In the pre-ﬂare phase before the hot eruption, sev-
eral of the peripheral warm coronal loops belonging
to the same active region exhibit either expanding
or contracting motions. The projected velocities of
these motions are −2.9±0.9 to +21.4±2.1 km s−1.
In terms of the standard solar ﬂare model in 3D,
we interpret these expanding and contracting mo-
tions as displacement of the coronal loops by the
growing and erupting ﬂux rope.

6. After the hot eruption, a number of coronal loops
exhibit contracting motions and subsequent oscil-
lations with periods of several minutes. This be-

haviour precludes the coronal implosion as the pri-
mary energy release mechanism, since the hot ﬂux
rope exists and erupts before the loops contract and
the oscillations set in. Rather, we propose that the
apparent implosion is a result of the large-scale dy-
namics involving the ﬂux rope eruption.

7. The loop oscillations are also detected as a modu-
lated radio ﬂux at the frequency of 350 MHz. The
radio ﬂux is modulated in phase with the loop os-
cillations. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst such
observation.

8. Chromospheric evaporation in the Fe XXI line ob-
served by the IRIS instrument shows gradual in-
crease of the blue-shift velocities during the early
ﬂare phase. This increase can be at least par-
tially explained by the changing geometry of ﬂare
loops at the position of the IRIS slit as a result
of the slipping reconnection. At ﬁrst, the IRIS
slit crosses the top portions of ﬂare loops, while
later on, the Fe XXI emission is dominated by
bright ﬂare loop footpoints. The highest velocities
of ≈266 km s−1 are detected in the impulsive phase
when the IRIS signal is dominated by the footpoint
emission. Although the line is visible during most
of the early and impulsive phases, a detailed study
of the evaporation during the beginning of the early
ﬂare phase is somewhat limited by the sensitivity
of the IRIS instrument, making the Fe XXI line
hardly visible or undetectable.

9. In the early ﬂare phase, the precursor activity in-
cluding RHESSI 6–12 keV sources is detected and
found to be fully consistent with the standard so-
lar ﬂare model in 3D. These precursors, interpreted
previously as signatures of the tether-cutting re-
connection, are identiﬁed here with the ﬂare itself,
progressing from the early phase towards the im-
pulsive phase. In terms of the standard solar ﬂare
model in 3D, the tether-cutting mechanism is pro-
vided by the slipping reconnection.

In conclusion, this in-depth and comprehensive study of
an X-class ﬂare, observed with several diﬀerent instru-
ments and also in the radio, conﬁrms most of the predic-
tions of the 3D standard ﬂare model.
