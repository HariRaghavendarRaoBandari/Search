Abstract: We discuss large N rules of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the bi-local
representation of holography of this theory. This is done by establishing 1/N Feynman
rules in terms of bi-local propagators and vertices, which can be evaluated following the
recent procedure of Polchinski and Rosenhaus. These rules can be interpreted as Witten type
diagrams of the dual AdS theory.

1 Introduction

Simple models of AdS/CFT duality are valuable laboratories for in-depth understanding of
holography and quantum features of black holes. One such model is the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev
(SYK) model [4–6] arising recently from the earlier Sachdev-Ye (SY) model [1–3] representing
a system of one dimensional fermions quantized with quenched disorder. This model can be
studied in the 1/N expansion and at strong coupling with an IR ﬁxed point and potentially
very interesting AdS2 dual. Kitaev [4], has demonstrated the chaotic behavior of the strongly
coupled system (at Large N ) in terms of the Lyapunov exponent and has exhibited some
elements of the dual black hole. Recently, Polchinski and Rosenhaus [6, 7] have evaluated the
spectrum of two particle states of the SYK model by solving the large-N Schwinger-Dyson
(SD) equations of the four-point function. Their solution (and earlier works [4, 5]) employ
the emergent conformal symmetry of the model and correspondingly exhibit characteristic
features of the AdS theory. Further the in-depth studies [8] of the model are of deﬁnite interest
specially in view of the appearance of the thermal butterﬂy eﬀect [9–20] characteristic of black
holes. In this paper, inspired by these positive results of [6], we discuss a description of the
SYK theory in terms of explicit 1/N rules given in terms of bi-local propagators and vertices
[21] associated with O(N ) symmetry appearing after the quenched disorder averaging. This
collective representation systematically incorporates arbitrary n-point bi-local correlators and
generates the corresponding SD equations in terms of closed set of observables that provide
a holographic interpretation [21]. For the generic case of N -component Vector/Higher Spin

Gravity duality [22, 23] bi-locality provides an explicit implementation of holography [21, 24–
28]. The present SYK system shares analogous features and can be studied along the same
line, as the d = 1 case with an AdS2 dual. The collective ﬁelds (bi-local or loop) can be
also termed as ‘precursors’ [29] and their ability to encode bulk information relates to the
completeness of these variables at Large N . We also mention a similarity with another c = 1
/2D duality representing matrix mechanics and non-critical string theory. The overview of
our work is as follows: After reviewing the basic features of the SYK model in the replica
formulation we formulate in Section 2 the corresponding bi-local collective theory with explicit
1/N rules given in terms of propagators and vertices. We use this to consider the n → 0
limiting theory (with n being the replica number) which is a necessary step in transition to
the dual description. In Section 3, we present elements of the limiting theory. The bi-local
propagator deﬁning the 1/N diagrams is evaluated in the basis established in [6]. It is seen
to lead the same poles as in [6] with a (non-polynomial) AdS bulk representation. The cubic
vertex is presented in detail, and analogous higher vertices are seen to be speciﬁed, which can
be interpreted as Witten type rules of the bulk theory. In Appendices A and B, it is seen
that these vertices lead to correct two ( i.e. 4 1) and three ( i.e. 6 ) point large-N Green’s
functions.

2 Replica Collective Field Theory

In the series of talk [4], Kitaev presented a simpliﬁed version of the Sachdev-Ye model, which
nevertheless exhibits holographic features and chaotic behavior. This N -site fermionic theory
is represented by the Hamiltonian

As it is seen after the Jijkl-integration, the O(N ) symmetry χi → Oijχj becomes visible; with
the site indices i, j of the original version of the model now becoming internal O(N ) indices
of the eﬀective one site model. For the O(N ) symmetric version of the model, one can now
use the (Lagrangian version of) collective ﬁeld formulation of the large N limiting theory
[21, 30, 31]. One uses the bi-local (replica) collective ﬁeld

i (t2) ≡ Ψ(X, Y )

(2.8)

where a compact notation which packages (space-)time t and the replica index a into one
variable X. In this notation, the collective bi-local ﬁeld is anti-symmetric :

and its dynamics is governed by the eﬀective action

Here the log term summarizes the entropy of the original degrees of freedom, which are re-
placed by the bi-local ﬁelds. The special usefulness of these comes from the fact that they
represent a closed set under Large N Schwinger-Dyson equations. In vector type models one
can generally employ bi-local ﬁelds of various type, in particular through Gaussian Hubbard-
Stratonovich type transformations, and that has been employed in the present model (see[2]).
The single collective ﬁeld representation provides however a compact formulation which gen-
erates the 1/N rules in concrete terms, with 1/N vertices taking a star-product form. For
this one ﬁrst identiﬁes the background ﬁeld associated with variation of Scol

Here we have deﬁned a diﬀerential operator D(X, Y ) in bi-local space:

which is seen to be anti-symmetric :

D(X, Y ) ≡ δa,bδ(x − y)∂y

Manipulating this equation, one can obtain a recursion relation for the background ﬁeld Ψ0:

−1(X, Z)[Ψ0(Z, W )]3Ψ0(W, Y ) .

Note that the background ﬁeld is diagonal in the replica space because the operator D is
diagonal

Ψ0(X, Y ) = δa,bψ0(x, y) .

(2.15)

In the strong coupling limit J → ∞, required to reach the IR ﬁxed point one can neglect the
left-hand side of the saddle point equation (2.14). Therefore, from the replica limit (2.4), one
obtains the tree-level free energy as

Here, we need anti-symmetrization in Xi and Xi+1 (i = 1, 3, 5), and symmetrization among
(X1, X2), (X3, X4) and (X5, X6). This will simplify the calculation because the bi-local
ﬂuctuation is anti-symmetric.

1/N Diagrams

Expressing the quadratic action in terms of (space-)time and replica index explicitly, one
ﬁnds that the potential term contains only diagonal piece in replica space. Therefore, one

However, since in the replica trick (2.4) one has to take n → 0 limit, we do not need
to keep track of all contributions in the replica collective theory. In standard local quantum
ﬁeld theory, this limit leads to the linked cluster theorem, i.e. one needs to consider only
connected diagrams. In the SYK model, this means that one needs only connected diagrams
of the fundamental fermions χi, as discussed in [4, 6]. In our bi-local collective theory, the
n → 0 limit implies that only the replica diagonal propagator is relevant after this limit.
This can be seen from explicit analysis of the diagrams, for example in Figure 1. Two-
loop diagrams are given in Appendix A. There, the “twisting” of inside and outside lines
represents diagonalization of the replica indices, i.e. δa,b.
In order for a diagram to have
order n contribution, every loop in the diagram must have at least one twisting. Accordingly,
every bi-local propagator has the same replica index for both lines. This concludes that for
O(n), which survives under the replica trick, only replica diagonal propagator is relevant. For
example,the the formal expression for the one-loop free energy is given by

F(1) =

1
2

Tr log K

(2.29)

where the trace is taken over the bi-local time.

2.2 Two-point Function

The collective action based on the bi-local is known to reproduce systematically the Large
N results of the theory. In particular it can be shown to generate the full set of Large N

local correlation function, since it plays a special role as a propagator and also for the purpose
of comparison with earlier results. A simple way to derive it is through the Schwinger-Dyson

For this, the collective coordinates can be chosen by

3 AdS Bulk

From the replica collective ﬁeld theory as we have discussed in the previous section, we can
deduce rules deﬁning the n → 0 limiting theory. This leads to a sequence of bi-local interacting
vertices and an action:

Scol = S2 +

As in earlier construction of Higher Spin holography based on bi-local observables [24–26],
we will identify them with the bulk ﬁelds of AdS. In the present d = 1 case one only has
a bulk scalar as a propagating ﬁeld. For this the 1/N rules of the above expansion will be
interpreted as Witten type rules for the bulk AdS.

Note that we expressed the quadratic action by an integral over z > 0 using the symmetry
of uνw. The appearance of a non-polynomial diﬀerential operator deﬁning the scalar ﬁeld
propagation is not unusual in string theory, in the present case one expects gravitational ﬁelds
which are integrated out in the above representation. We also note a similarity with the c = 1
Noncritical string duality case where one deﬁnes propagators associated with loop variables
of the matrix model [32]. In that case through external leg redeﬁnition, one obtains a local
picture with a standard Laplacian of [33]. Here we can also introduce nonlocal redeﬁnitions
of the ﬁeld to achieve an analogues result resulting in standard form of the AdS ﬁeld theory.
For this, we redeﬁne the bulk ﬁeld φ as follows:

4 Conclusion

There are a number of topic that can be part of further studies. First, concerning the 3-
vertex (and also higher point vertices) the question of AdS locality is of deﬁnite interest.
Some indications that this might be possible to achieve were given, this question is also
closely related to the external leg redeﬁnitions of the scalar ﬁeld. A continuing study of ﬁnite
temperature extension of the formalism is of major relevance. For this, the formalism of TFD
(Thermo-Field dynamics) applies and can be implemented in parallel to recent TFD O(N )
vector model studies [34, 35].

A Higher Loop Diagrams

In this appendix, we list discuss diagrams for the replica collective theory and their n de-
pendence up to two-loop order. Here, the “twisting” of the bi-local propagator represents
the diagonalization of the replica space, i.e. δa,b. Because of this twisting, all O(n) diagrams
contain only one replica index, which implies that only the replica diagonal propagator is
relevant after the replica trick.
