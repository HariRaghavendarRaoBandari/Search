In this article we introduce a novel quantum state, the perfect quantum optical vortex state
which exhibits a highly localised distribution along a ring in the quadrature space. We examine its
nonclassical properties using the Wigner function and the negativity volume. Such a quantum state
can be a useful resource for quantum information processing and communication.

INTRODUCTION

Implementation of quantum information protocols us-
ing the various tools at the disposal of quantum optics has
always resulted in intriguing study. This ﬁeld of research
has seen intense activity since quite some time and be-
came even more interesting ever since the seminal KLM
proposal [1]. One of the most potent tools used by re-
searchers in this ﬁeld for the generation of entangled pairs
of particles, namely photons, is the spontaneous para-
metric down conversion (SPDC) using non linear beta
barium borate (BBO) crystals. In this unique process, a
single photon splits into two photons which are entan-
gled in multiple degrees of freedom (DOF). This process
also leads to the formation of hyperentangled pairs of
photons. In hyperentanglement, the pair of particles is
entangled in all the available DOF [2]. The uniqueness
of SPDC lies in the fact, that the photon pair can be
treated to be entangled in any particular degree of free-
dom as required by the application protocol irrespective
of the other DOF. For example, the output from type II
SPDC can be described by the following expression

|Ψ(cid:105)SP DC =

1√
2

(|H1(cid:105)|V2(cid:105) + |V1(cid:105)|H2(cid:105))

(1)

where H, V denote the polarization state of the photons
arriving in diametrically opposite points of the SPDC
ring. It means that if the ﬁrst photon is found to be hori-
zontally polarized, the second photon would be vertically
polarized and vice versa. The same output, can be also
written as

(cid:88)

|Φ(cid:105) =

Cl1,l2|l(cid:105)| − l(cid:105)

(2)

l

where l denotes the OAM value and the state is seen to
be entangled in OAM [3]. Since OAM values can range

from −∞ to +∞, such a state can exhibit very high de-
gree of entanglement. Moreoever, systems like this can be
used in the implementation of complete Bell state analy-
sis [4, 5] with 100% eﬃciency using only linear elements
[6]. Besides, hyperentangled systems exhibit signiﬁcant
advantages in quantum communication protocols like su-
perdense coding [7] and quantum crytography [8].
In general, photon pairs produced in SPDC output be-
long to the larger class of Gaussian states and has been
subjected to detailed study and scrutiny over the years in
the context of quantum information [9]. Lately though,
there has been increasing focus on a new class of states
being generated from SPDC photons called the quantum
vortex states [10–16]. These are non-Gaussian quantum
states exhibiting phase singularity or topological defect.
A vortex state of topological index l carries with it an
orbital angular momentum l. It has also been reported
that higher the order, higher is the entanglement [14].
Although l can range from 0 to ∞, neglecting the hand-
edness, in practice, it is observed, higher the order, larger
is the spread of the vortex core. A way out of this is
the generation of perfect quantum optical vortex states
(PQOVS). The spread of the vortex core do not change
with the order of OAM in such PQOVS. In this article
we report the generation of the PQOVS and study its
various properties through the use of quadrature distri-
bution and Wigner function.
In order to generate the PQOVS, we begin with one of the
simplest non - Gaussian state, the pair coherent states.
Pair coherent states, introduced by Agarwal, are coher-
ent states with a ﬁxed diﬀerence in the number of pho-
tons between the modes. The diﬀerence in the number of
photons ﬁxes the order or topological charge of the state.
These states are Bessel - Gaussian in nature. We perform
a Fourier transform on pair coherent states to generate
the perfect vortex.
The article is organized as follows. In section II we
present a detailed mathematical study on the generation
of PQOVS. In section III, we derive the Wigner function
associated with PQOVS explicitly and present our inter-
pretations of the results obtained therein. We conclude
the article in section IV with a brief review of the results

and directions for future work.

II. GENERATING A PERFECT QUANTUM

VORTEX

A perfect optical vortex, in theory, is best represented

by the equation

E (r, θ) =

il−1
kr

δ (r − rc) exp (ilθ)

(3)

which represents an ideal perfect optical vortex beam
with the central dark core having a radius rc. Such a
vortex beam can be generated by Fourier transforming
an ideal Bessel beam using a simple lens [17]. But, as
noted by the authors in the same work, generation of
ideal Bessel beam is not possible experimentally. A way
out of this is by using a Bessel - Gauss beam in place of
ideal Bessel beam of the form

E(ρ, φ) = Jl(kr, ρ) exp(ilφ) exp

(4)

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

− ρ2
σ2

where Jl(kr, ρ) is the l th order Bessel function of the ﬁrst
kind. kr is the longitudinal wave vector and the second
exponential term on the right represents the Gaussian
wavepacket that conﬁnes the Bessel beam. In order to
generate a perfect quantum optical vortex, one should
begin with a state that reduces to the form of Eq. 3 in
the quadrature distribution. To that end, we begin with
one of the simplest non - Gaussian quantum states, often
referred to as pair coherent states [18] in the literature.
In the coherent state representation, these states can be
written as

(cid:16)(cid:112)ζeiθ(cid:17)−q |(cid:112)ζeiθ(cid:105)|(cid:112)ζe−iθ(cid:105)dθ

2π(cid:112)ζ qI0 (2ζ)

eq

(cid:90) 2π

0

|ζ, q(cid:105) =

(5)
where I0 represents the modiﬁed Bessel function of the
ﬁrst kind of order 0. ζ is the complex amplitude. The
meaning of q becomes clear when Eq. 5 is written in the
Fock basis as follows

1(cid:112)ζ qI0 (2ζ)

∞(cid:88)

n=0

ζ n(cid:112)n! (n + q)!

|ζ, q(cid:105)F =

|n + q, n(cid:105)

(6)

As is evident from the above equation, q is the number of
photons added to one of the modes of a two mode state.
Or in other words, it is the diﬀerence in the number of
photons present in each mode. Under conditional para-
metric conversion process, a pair coherent state evolves
to a vortex state as observed in [19]. The Hamiltonian
describing such a process has the following form

H = ωaa†a + ωbb†b + κ(cid:0)a†beiηt + ab†e−iηt(cid:1)

(7)

where η is the diﬀerence in frequencies and κ is the cou-
pling constant. Under this Hamiltonian, Eq. 5 evolves

tion. Eq. 8 represents a BG vortex state [19] of topological
charge q. It carries with it orbital angular momentum q.

where α = |ζ| and Jq is the qth order Bessel function of

transformed by passing it through a simple lens. The
transformation equation corresponding to such a process,
for an arbitrary beam E (ρ, φ) can be expressed as [20]

radius even for very high orders of the PQOVS. In our
study, we have used α = 15. We observe that the radius
of the dark core remains almost constant for diﬀerent or-
ders of the vortex or topological charge. In contrast, the
central core radius of a standard BG vortex varies quite
substantially with changing values of q. Slight variation
in the core radius is also observed for the PQOVS and
can be attributed to the rate of change of Iq with q as
noted in [17]. But this change is almost negligible when
compared to the change observed in the case of a stan-
dard BG vortex. The order or the topological charge of
the generated PQOVS can be conﬁrmed by studying the
phase of the associated quadrature distribution of Eq. 13
which we study in Fig. 2. We observe a single disconti-
nuity for q = 1 and ten discontinuities for q = 10, ﬁfteen
for q = 15 and twenty for q = 20 which corresponds to
the order of the PQOVS.

III. WIGNER FUNCTION OF THE PQOVS

the role played by the axicon parameter in [17]. On fur-
ther comparison, we note that σ can be interpreted as
the Gaussian beam waist at the focus. Eq. 13 represents
the quadrature distribution associated with the perfect
quantum optical vortex state.
We study the perfect quantum optical vortex (PQOVS)
state in Fig. 1. We have used λ = 810nm and focal length
of the lens f = 70cm for all the ﬁgures. In case of α, it was
observed that a higher value resulted in more stability of
the core radius for higher order PQOVS. An advantage
of this scheme over the classical scheme is that in the
later the axicon parameter had to be modiﬁed to keep
the core radius ﬁxed with changing order of the resultant
state. That would involve modiﬁcation of the experimen-
tal setup. But in our scheme, only modifying the coherent
state amplitude imparts far greater stability to the core

In this section, we derive the Wigner function [21] as-
sociated with a PQOVS. The Wigner function is a quasi
probability distribution. It diﬀers from a classical prob-
ability distribution due to the fact that it takes negative
values for which there are no classical analogues. It pro-
vides direct evidence of non locality for EPR systems
[22]. It can also be interpreted as the Fourier transform
of the two point correlation function. The marginals of
the Wigner function should be interpreted as partial trace
operations. The reduced Wigner function, that is the case
when any one (two) quadrature(s) is (are) taken as the
argument while the other one (two) is (are) treated as pa-
rameter(s) for a single (two) mode state should be inter-
preted as a conditional probability distribution where the
outcome of one is conditioned upon the outcome of the
other. It is in this respect, the negativity of the Wigner

where |p|2 = p2
y and px and py are conjugate mo-
menta of the two modes. Lq represents the Laguerre poly-
nomial of order q. We observe that the ﬁnal form of the
Wigner function consists of a Gaussian factor composed
of quadratures of both the modes, a modiﬁed Bessel func-
tion of order q only in r and a Laguerre polynomial,
also of order q which takes a combination of the com-
ponents of (cid:126)r and (cid:126)p as arguments. We study the proper-
ties of Eq. 16 in more detail in Fig. 3. Since W is 4 -
dimensional in structure, it is impossible to reproduce
the full form of W on paper. Hence we study the nature
of the Wigner function for six possible combinations of
the quadratures taking any two as parameters and the
other two as variables at a certain instant in Fig. 3. It
is observed that all the six combinations, i.e. W (x, y),
W (x, px), W (x, py), W (y, py), W (y, px) and W (px, py)
show negative regions. This negativity has often been in-
terpreted as an indicator of quantum interference. The
Wigner function corresponding to the quadratures x and
y, Fig. 3a and px and py, Fig. 3f, exhibit similar nature. It
consists of concentric rings of diminishing intensity with
the intensity diminishing while moving outwards from
the centre. Similar quadratures of the two modes (spa-
tial quadratures in Fig. 3a and momentum quadratures
in Fig. 3f) oscillate in orthogonal directions to give rise to
the concentric rings which are bounded by the Gaussian
function and hence the rings decrease in magnitude. In
case of W (x, px), both quadratures of a mode overlap to
give rise to the pattern seen in Fig. 3b. A similar expla-
nation holds for Fig. 3d. The interesting results appear
in Fig. 3c and Fig. 3e. A correlation is observed between
the spatial quadrature of one mode and the mmomentum
quadrature of the other mode. The spatial quadrature of
one mode interacts with the momentum quadrature of
the other mode in absence of the spatial quadrature of
the later and momentum quadrature of the former to give
rise to interference like structure with negative regions.
These structures have often been referred to as quantum
interference pattern and the associated negative volume
used to study nonclassical correlations. The negative vol-

function, which has been interpreted as a signature of
non classicality [23], assumes greater importance. Here
we would like to quote Feynman “If a physical theory
for calculating probabilities yields a negative probability
for a given situation under certain assumed conditions,
we need not conclude the theory is incorrect. Two other
possibilities of interpretation exist. One is that the condi-
tions (for example, initial conditions) may not be capable
of being realised in the physical world. The other possibil-
ity is that the situation for which the probability appears
to be negative is not one that can be veriﬁed directly. A
combination of these two, limitation of veriﬁability and
freedom in initial conditions, may also be a solution to
the apparent diﬃculty” [24]. In this context, studying
the Wigner function associated with our proposed state
seems all the more interesting. The Wigner function for
any arbitrary state ψ((cid:126)r) of two modes is deﬁned as

prominent for q=2. With further increase in q, the inter-
ference pattern starts to separate out becoming sparse
and localized in two distinct regions with the separation
distance increasing with increasing order of the vortex.
This is evident from Fig. 5. The study of the negative
volume can thus be used to state conclusively that the
quantum interference eﬀect decreases with increasing or-
der of the vortex but it remains inconclusive with regards
to nonclassicality.

IV. CONCLUSION

To conclude, we have introduced and theoretically
studied the generation of a new non - Gaussian state
with strong underlying non classical properties. We call
this state perfect BG vortex state or PQOVS. We have
shown that a standard BG quantum vortex evolves into
a PQOVS under Fourier transformation using a simple
lens. The PQOVS thus generated has a ﬁxed core radius
which can be controlled by varying the initial conditions
to suit speciﬁc applications. As an advantage over re-
cently introduced BG vortex states, the central dark core
of PQOVS does not change noticeably with increasing or-
der or topological charge of the vortex. Slight change in
the radius can be oﬀset by slighlty altering the coherent
state amplitude of the initial pair coherent state. We have
also calculated the Wigner function of the PQOVS. It is
observed that all the six combinations of the 4-D Wigner
function exhibit negative values which is a strong indi-
cation of non - classical behavior. Interesting patterns
are also observed in the study of W (x, py) and W (y, px)
which can be interpreted as a signature of quantum in-
terference between the two modes of the PQOVS state.
The negative volume of W (x, py) is calculated for various
orders of the vortex. It is observed that the negative vol-
ume peaks for q = 2 after which it decays asymtotically
with increasing order. This is because the quantum inter-
ference pattern in W (x, py) is most pronounced for q = 2
after which the interference pattern starts to disintegrate
into two parts and appears to be localized in two distinct
locations with no interaction between the two parts. The
negativity of the Wigner function can therefore be used
as a measure of the quantum correlation/interference be-
tween constituent modes but no conclusion can be drawn
on the behavior of nonclassicality of the PQOVS with in-
creasing order of the vortex.

fore reaching a peak value of 1.287 for q = 2 after which
it decays asymtotically. This can be explained by the fact
that the interference decreases with increasing value of q.
For q=0 there is only peak with no interference. The in-
terference pattern ﬁrst appears for q=1 and is the most
