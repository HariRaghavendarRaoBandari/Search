The mass, decay constant and width of a hypothetical charmed partner of the newly discovered
exotic Xb(5568) state are calculated using a technique of QCD sum rule method. The evaluation of
the mass mXc and decay constant fXc is carried out utilizing the two-point sum rule and including
vacuum condensates up to eight dimensions. The width of Xc is found via its decay channel Xc →
s π+. To this end, the vertex XcDsπ is studied and the strong coupling gXcDs π computed by
D−
means of QCD sum rules on the light-cone and soft-meson approximation.
In calculations two
versions of the [su][cd] type diquark-antidiquark interpolating current with J P = 0+ are employed.

INTRODUCTION

s π±, B0

The D0 Collaboration recently reported the discov-
ery of a narrow structure Xb(5568) in the decay pro-
cess Xb(5568) → B0
s → J/ψφ, J/ψ → µ+µ−,
φ → K +K − based on p¯p collision data at √s = 1.96 TeV
collected at the Fermilab Tevatron collider [1]. The new
state Xb(5568) is considered to posses quantum numbers
J P C = 0++. The D0 Collaboration provides the values
mXb = 5567.8± 2.9(stat)+0.9
−1.9(syst) MeV for its mass, and
estimates Γ = 21.9±6.4(stat)+5.0
−2.5(syst) MeV for its decay
width. As it was emphasized in Ref. [1] this is the ﬁrst
observation of a hadronic state with four diﬀerent quark
ﬂavors: Xb state is composed of b, s, u, d quarks.

Suggestions concerning the possible quark-antiquark
organization of Xb were made already in Ref. [1]. Thus,
within the diquark-antidiquark model, the Xb state with
positive charge, i.e. the particle X +
b may be described
as [bu][ ¯d¯s] or [su][¯b ¯d] bound state, whereas X −
b may have
structure [bd][¯s¯u] or [sd][¯b¯u]. Alternatively, Xb may be
considered as a molecule composed of B and K mesons.
This is valuable discovery, because the charmonium-
like resonances that populate XY Z family of ”tradi-
tional” exotic states, contain a pair of c¯c charm quarks
and hence, the number of the quark ﬂavors in these par-
ticles does not exceed three. Properties of known exotic
states extracted from experimental data and theoretical
calculations can be found in, for instance, review papers
[2–9] and references therein.

The newly observed state Xb(5568) has immediately
attracted interests of physicists and stimulated theoreti-
cal studies of Xb in the context of diﬀerent approaches.
Thus, in Refs. [10, 11] we have calculated the mass, de-
cay constant and width of the Xb(5568) state within the
diquark picture [su][¯b ¯d] considering the exotic state with
positive charge. Our predictions for the mass mXb , and
s π+) are in agree-
for the width of its decay Γ(Xb → B0
ment with the experimental data. It is worth noting that
in the context of the diquark model some parameters of
Xb were also analyzed in Refs. [12–15]. In these works the

authors use various versions for the diquark-antidiquark
type interpolating currents mentioned above with diﬀer-
ent Lorentz structures.
It is remarkable, that the ob-
tained values for mXb are in agreement with each other
and also consistent with experimental data of D0 Col-
laboration. The molecule picture for Xb was realized in
Ref. [16], where the Xb(5568) state was taken as the BK
bound state. The questions of quark-antiquark organi-
zation of this particle and its partners were addressed in
Ref. [17].

In the present work we are going to continue our in-
vestigation of the new family of the four-quark exotic
states by considering the hypothetical charmed partner
of the Xb(5568) state that is, naturally, composed of the
c, s, u, d quarks. We assume that this state bears the
same quantum numbers as its counterpart, i.e. J P C =
0++. We also accept that it has the internal structure
given by the [su][¯c ¯d] diquark model. Thus, the partner
state Xc is a neutral particle. Our aim is to determine the
parameters of the state Xc, i.e. to ﬁnd its mass, decay
s π+. To
constant and width of the strong decay Xc → D−
this end, we use methods presented in a rather detailed
form in Refs. [10, 11, 18].

This work is structured in the following way. In Sec-
tion II we introduce the interpolating currents employed
in QCD sum rule calculations. Here we ﬁnd the mass
and decay constant of Xc using, for our purposes, the
two-point QCD sum rule approach. The width of the
s π+ is subject of Sect. III. Re-
strong decay Xc → D−
sults of numerical calculations are presented in Sect. IV.
This section contains also our concluding notes. Explicit
expressions for the spectral density required in compu-
tation of the mass and decay constant of the exotic Xc
state are moved to Appendix A.

II. THE MASS AND DECAY CONSTANT OF Xc

As it was noted above we use the two-point QCD sum
rule approach in order to compute mass and decay con-
stant of the Xc state. To this end, we consider the two-

q (x) and Sij

where Sij
c-quark propagators, respectively.

point correlation function given as

Π(p) = iZ d4xeipxh0|T {J Xc

1(2)(x)J Xc †

1(2) (0)}|0i,

where J Xc
1(2)(x) are the interpolating currents with re-
quired quantum numbers. We consider Xc state as a
particle with the quantum numbers J P C = 0++. Then
in the diquark-antidiquark model the current J Xc
1 (x) is
given by the following expression

n

n

J Xc

1 (x) = εijkεimn(cid:2)sj(x)Cγµuk(x)(cid:3)hcm(x)γµCd

(2)
Alternatively, one may introduce the interpolating cur-
rent

(x)i .

J Xc

(x)i .

2 (x) = εijkεimn(cid:2)sj(x)Cγ5uk(x)(cid:3)hcm(x)γ5Cd

(3)
In Eqs. (2) and (3) i, j, k, m, n are color indexes and C
is the charge conjugation matrix.
Let us note that the current J Xc

1 (x) has been employed
throughout in Refs. [10, 11] for exploration the exotic
Xb(5568) state. The sum rules derived in these works,
after trivial replacements of corresponding parameters,
can easily be applied to analyze the Xc state. Therefore,
in what follows we concentrate on the current J Xc
2 (x)
omitting, in what follows, the subscript in its deﬁnition.
The representation of the function Π(p) in terms of the
physical quantities does not depend on the form of the
interpolating current and is the same for both J Xc

where mXc is the mass of the Xc state, and dots stand
for contributions of the higher resonances and continuum
states. We deﬁne the decay constant fXc through the
matrix element

h0|J Xc|Xc(p)i = fXcmXc .

Then, for the correlation function we obtain

can be computed using mathematical methods described
in Refs. [10, 18]. Therefore, here we omit details of calcu-
lations and provide explicit expressions for both ρQCD(s)
in Appendix A.

Applying the Borel transformation on the variable p2
to the invariant amplitude ΠQCD(p2), equating the ob-
tained expression Bp2ΠPhys(p), and subtracting the con-
tinuum contribution, we ﬁnally obtain the required sum
rule. Thus, the mass of the Xc state can be evaluated
from the sum rule

The last two expressions are the sum rules needed to
evaluate the Xc state’s mass and decay constant, respec-
tively.

III. THE WIDTH OF THE STRONG DECAY

Xc → D−

s π+

In this section we ﬁnd the width of Xc → D−

s π+ de-
cay. To this end, we calculate the strong coupling gXcDsπ
using method of QCD sum rule on the light-cone in con-
junction with the soft-meson approximation. We con-
sider the correlation function

Π(p, q) = iZ d4xeipxhπ(q)|T {J Ds(x)J Xc†(0)}|0i, (14)

that allows us to get the sum rule for the coupling gXcDsπ.
Here the interpolating current J Xc(x) is given by Eq. (3),
whereas for D−

s we use

J Ds(x) = cl(x)iγ5sl(x).

It is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd Π(p, q) in terms of the physical

degrees of freedom:

where m2 = (m2

To proceed, we have to calculate ΠQCD(p, q) in terms
of the quark-gluon degrees of freedom and ﬁnd QCD side
of the sum rule. Contractions in Eq. (14) of s and c-quark
ﬁelds yield

sity, which is given as a sum of the perturbative and

As is seen, in the soft limit the spectral density depends
only the parameters fπ and µπ through the pion’s local
matrix element

where by dots we denote contributions of the higher res-
onances and continuum states. Here p, q and p′ = p + q,
are the momenta of Ds, π, and Xc states, respectively.
In order to ﬁnish computation of the correlation function
we introduce the matrix elements

(17)

where fXc, mXc are the decay constant and mass of the
Xc state, whereas fDs, mDs are the same parameters of
the Ds meson.

We calculate ΠPhys(p, q) in the soft-meson limit q = 0,
and after some manipulations described in Refs. [11, 18],
for the Borel transformation of the correlation function

IV. RESULTS AND CONCLUDING NOTES

The QCD sum rules derived above contain numerous
parameters that should be ﬁxed in accordance with the
standard procedures. Thus, for numerical computation
of the Xc state’s mass and decay constant we need values
of the quark, gluon and mixed condensates. Additionally,
QCD sum rules contain c and s quark masses, and depend
on Ds meson’s mass and decay constant. The values of
used parameters are moved to Table I. It is worth noting
that for the decay constant fDs of the Ds meson we use
the lattice result from Ref. [20].

Sum rule calculations imply ﬁxing regions for the pa-
rameters s0 and M 2, where they can be varied. For s0
we employ

7.56 GeV2 ≤ s0 ≤ 8.12 GeV2.

(27)

We ﬁnd the range 2 GeV2 < M 2 < 4 GeV2 as a reliable
region for varying the Borel parameter. Here the eﬀects
of the higher resonances and continuum states, and con-
tributions of the higher dimensional condensates satisfy
well known requirements of QCD sum rule calculations.
It is not diﬃcult to see that, in these intervals the de-
pendence of the mass and decay constant on M 2 and s0
is stable, and we expect that the sum rules give the ﬁrm
predictions (see Figs. 1 and 2). We estimate ambiguities
of the numerical computations by varying the parameters
M 2 and s0 within the accepted ranges, as well as taking
into account uncertainties coming from other input pa-
rameters. The results for diﬀerent parameters obtained
in our calculations using two interpolating currents are
collected in Table II.

As is seen, diﬀerent interpolating currents lead to al-
most identical predictions for the mass of the Xc state.
Nevertheless, a diﬀerence between two values for the de-
cay width Γ(Xc → Dsπ+) is sizeable. The discovery of
the exotic Xb particle by D0 Collaboration allows us to
hope that its partner state Xc may be observed in a near
future. Comparison of the results obtained in this study
with data of any future experiment can give valuable in-
formation about the nature and internal structure of the
Xc state.
