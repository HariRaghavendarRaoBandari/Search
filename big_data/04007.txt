Abstract This paper is not (or at least not only) about human infant mortality.
In line with reliability theory, “infant” will refer here to the time interval following
birth during which the mortality (or failure) rate decreases. This deﬁnition provides a
systems science perspective in which birth constitutes a sudden transition which falls
within the ﬁeld of application of the Transient Shock (TS) conjecture put forward in
Richmond et al. (2016c). This conjecture provides predictions about the timing and
shape of the death rate peak. (i) It says that there will be a death rate spike whenever
external conditions change abruptly and drastically. (ii) It predicts that after a steep
rising there will be a much longer hyperbolic relaxation process.
These predictions can be tested by considering living organisms for which birth is a
multi-step process. Thus, for ﬁsh there are three states: egg, yolk-sac phase, young
adult. The TS conjecture predicts a mortality spike at the end of the yolk-sac phase,
and this timing is indeed conﬁrmed by observation.
Secondly, the hyperbolic nature of the relaxation process can be tested using high
accuracy Swiss statistics which give postnatal death rates from one hour after birth
up to the age of 10 years. It turns out that since the 19th century despite a great overall
reduction in infant mortality, the shape of the age-speciﬁc death rate has remained
basically unchanged. This hyperbolic pattern is not speciﬁc to humans. It can also
be found in small primates as recorded in the archives of zoological gardens.
Our ultimate objective is to set up a chain of cases which starts from simple systems
and then moves up step by step to more complex organisms. The cases discussed
here can be seen as initial landmarks.

Introduction

There is a common saying according to which “science starts with the discovery of
a pattern”. In the present paper, we identify two patterns of infant mortality, namely
the yolk-sac pattern and the power-law death spike pattern. Whereas the ﬁrst pattern
is fairly well understood, the second raises questions for which we have no complete
answer so far. However, we believe that, taken together, these patterns give us new
insight into the mechanisms of infant mortality.

Infant mortality seen as a transition death spike
In a previous paper (Richmond et al. 2016c1) it was suggested that any major change
in the conditions under which a system operates will bring about an increased fail-
ure rate. In the same paper this mechanism was shown to be at work in the weeks
following birth, in the months following marriage and widowhood and also when el-
derly persons are relocated in nursing homes. In all these transitions between a state
1 and a state 2, one observes a transient mortality spike during which the death rate
is temporarily multiplied by a factor of 2 or 3 and even much more in the case of the
birth transition.

As explained in Richmond et al. (2016c), the observed death spikes have a simple
interpretation as being a selection process. The systems which were adapted to state
1 but are not adapted to state 2 are eliminated; this results in a death rate increase.
Although this explanation is satisfactory at a qualitative level, at a quantitative level
there remain questions such as the following.
• Can one establish a connection between the characteristics of the transition on
the one hand and and the amplitude of the mortality spike on the other hand?
• The infant mortality phase is characterized by a death rate which decreases as a
power law. Is this decrease species dependent or does it follow a general rule? We
will see that contrary to the increase of old-age death rates which are very species
dependent, the decrease of infant death rates is fairly uniform: µ = 1/tγ, where the
exponent γ is of the order of one.

Most of the time expression the expression “power law decrease” refers to the slow
decrease observed when t → ∞. Here on the contrary, the most conspicuous part
of the mortality spike (Fig. 1a) is the sharp decrease immediately following t =
0. Whereas a power law decrease is often meant as a fall that is slower than an
exponential, in the vicinity of t = 0 the fall is much faster than any exponential.
In order to emphasize this difference in what follows we will use the expression
“hyperbolic power law”.

1In a broader way, the present paper should be seen as paper number 4 in a series of socio- and bio-demography

investigations started in Richmond et al. (2016a) and continued in Richmond et al. (2016b,c).

of the spike.

Fig. 1a Transition from gestation to birth, USA 1923. The graph shows the death rate spike which occurs
after birth. The level section on the left-hand side schematically indicates the (time-averaged) rate of late fetal
mortality. Then, following birth, “defects” which were not of great consequence during gestation suddenly lead
to a dramatic increase of the failure rate. The highest point corresponds to the ﬁrst day, the second and third
points are for day 2 and 3 respectively. The fourth point is the (daily) average for the age interval (3, 7). In
the weeks and months following birth the death rate decreases as a power law. For the inset log-log plot of the
same data the coefﬁcient of linear correlation is 0.996 and the slope (i.e. the exponent of the power law) is 0.88.
Source: Linder and Grove (1947 p. 574-575).

However, in a semi-log representation one cannot identify the curve as a power law
and even more importantly one cannot explore a broad time interval. This is done in
Fig. 1b.
It shows three phases: (i) The hyperbolic power law decrease. (ii) A transition zone
where the death rate is ﬂuctuating without any deﬁnite trend. (iii) An aging phase
where the death rate increases sharply. The ﬁrst and third phases are certainly present
in all living organisms. The ﬁrst phase is a selection process through which the items
with “manufacturing defects” are eliminated. The increase that occurs in the last
stage is of course necessary if the death rate is to reach the level of 1,000 per 1,000
which signiﬁes total extinction of the cohort. Needless to say, the respective length
of each phase is species dependent. As an illustration one can mention the case of
naked mole rates. We are told that these small mammals live until the age of 25 and
that they remain in good health until the very end of their life (Buffenstein 2008).
This does not imply that the aging phase does not exist but rather that it is short and
therefore that the increase of the death rate is very steep.

Age (day)

Fig. 1b US death rates in log-log plot. There are two phases (infant and aging) separated by a transition.
During the infant phase the death rate decreases in an hyperbolic way. It can be noted that despite medical
progress the two ends of the curves have not changed much. In 1910 the slope of the falling regression line (i.e.
the exponent of the power law) was γ = 0.65 ± 0.04 whereas in 1960 it was γ = 1.01 ± 0.08. Source: 1910:
Mortality Statistics, Bulletin 109; 1960: Grove and Hetzel 1968, p. 210-211.

Physics relies on both experiments and theory. The exploration of a new ﬁeld usu-
ally starts with a number of insightful questions along with the experiments through
which they can be answered. This is what we try to do here. Therefore, it should
not come as a surprise that, at this point, we do not propose a full ﬂedged model. At
present the phenomenon of infant mortality is a black box in the sense that we do not
know its mechanisms. As a ﬁrst step, we need to identify the key variables. Once we
have got a better understanding it will be time to express it in mathematical terms2.
The paper will proceed as follows.

(1) In the next section we focus on an example of infant mortality which is quite
revealing because it does not occur at birth (in this case hatching) but at the end of
the yolk-sac phase.

(2)

In the following section, we discuss the case of a simple technical device,
namely incandescent light bulbs. This will give us the opportunity to explain in a

2In the arXiv version of this paper two classes of models are outlined. The ﬁrst class proposes a connection with the

distribution of defects whereas the second establishes a link between Gaussian and power-law random variables.

concrete way what should be meant by the expression “lethal defect”. It will be seen
that in this case one can expect a deterministic one-to-one correspondence between
an initial defect that is present in a sample of items and the age-speciﬁc failure rate.
(3) Then, we present human infant mortality data. The statistical evidence sug-
gests that the death rate in the hours following birth is largely independent of medical
care. In order to get a better insight into the selection process at work during the in-
fant mortality phase we distinguish death rates corresponding to various causes of
death. It will be seen that some follow a power law behavior whereas others do not.
(4) Next, in the hope of establishing a chain of cases extending from “simple ” to
“complex” systems, we present and discuss data for other species, e.g. farm animals,
primates, insects, plants.

Gompertz’s law versus infant mortality
Gompertz’s law consists in the fact that in any human population, after the age of 35,
the death rate increases exponentially with a doubling time of the order of 10 years.
For instance, in the United States in 1970, the death rate in the age group 35 − 44
was 3.1 per 1,000 population of both sexes, 7.3 for 45 − 54, 17 for 55 − 64, 36 for
65 − 74 and so on (Historical Statistics of the United States 1975, p. 60).
Strictly speaking, infant mortality refers to the mortality between birth and one year
of age. However, we will use this term in a broader sense for the whole period of
time following birth during which the death rate decreases before it levels off and
starts to climb. For humans, this phase extends from birth approximately to the age
of 10 years. In the present paper this phase will be referred to as the infant phase.
For humans (as well as for several other species) it roughly coincides with the period
before sexual maturity.

In reliability studies, the time interval marked by a fall of the failure rate is also called
infant phase3. The subsequent phase marked by an increasing failure rate is called
“wear out” phase.

Birth transitions deﬁned by the functions that must be switched on
In order to survive an animal or a plant must be able to use the oxygen contained in
the air or in the water for generating energy. It must also be able to ﬁnd food and to
digest it. For animals ﬁnding food implies several challenges. (i) Identiﬁcation (ii)
Moving to where it is located. (iii) Swallowing and digesting. In addition mammals
and birds need to regulate their body temperature. Table 1 provides a summary of
such functions in several types of species.
For all the functions that need to be implemented in state 2 there is a non-zero likeli-
hood of failure which will result in an inﬂated death rate. In other words, one expects

3Other commonly used expressions are “burn in phase” or “early failure period”.

Notes: The - sign means that the corresponding function either was already ensured in state 1 or is unnecessary
in state 2; e.g. temperature regulation is only necessary in homeothermic species. On the contrary, the + sign
means that in order to survive the newborn must be able to implement the corresponding function. The + sign
indicates that the function was already ensured in state 1 but not exactly in the way necessary in state 2. For
instance, bird embryos may be able to digest the yolk contained in the egg but unable to digest the food brought
to them by their parents. The table suggests that the birth of mammals involves more drastic changes than for
the other organisms mentioned in the table. Hence, one expects a particularly high mortality spike. Many other
functions are of vital importance (for ﬁshes one can mention inﬂation of the swim bladder) but most of them
are in fact included in the challenge of ﬁnding food because this task requires to see (or smell), move, catch,
swallow and digest.

a mortality spike each time a new function needs to be implemented. This may hap-
pen at the time of birth but in some cases it may also happen after birth. This is
illustrated in the next section.

The yolk-sac effect

In the previous section we have seen that for the case of human births the simulta-
neous activation of 3 functions brings about a huge spike. This naturally leads to
question what happens when only one or two functions are activated simultaneously.
If this activation occurs at a time t1 after birth one would expect a spike to occur
around t1. Does observation conﬁrm this prediction?
What kind of organisms would be most appropriate for such a test? An idea which
comes to mind is to use organisms whose development goes through several stages.
This is the case of most insects. Worms giving rise to ﬂies or caterpillars giving rise
to butterﬂies are well known cases. From egg to adult the development of insects
involves several stages, not to speak of the successive instars and moults. However,
for our purpose those stages are not really appropriate because they are too differ-
ent from one another. Feeding, for instance, is not at all the same problem for a
caterpillar and for a butterﬂy. Fish larvae provide a better case.

Yolk-sac mortality spike for ﬁsh larvae

7

When ﬁsh emerge from their egg they carry with them a yolk-sac which provides
them with food until it is exhausted. The insert of Fig. 2a shows such a yolk-sac for
salmons, a case in which it is particularly big. Once the sac is depleted, the ﬁsh must
ﬁnd their food themselves, a task which requires a whole chain of functionalities:
seeing, catching, swallowing and digesting the food. If any of these functionalities
fails the ﬁsh will die from starvation within a few days. Thus, one expects a mortality
spike in the days following the end of the yolk-sac phase.
It is interesting to observe that whereas this excess mortality has been commonly
observed it was often attributed to a number of special reasons (cannibalism, unex-
pected changes in tank conditions) without real awareness of the underlying reason4.

Anchovies and sardines
In Fig. 2a the slope of the survival curve displays slight oscillations. However, given
the scale of the statistical ﬂuctuations (shown by the thin lines) it would be tempting
to discard them as being non signiﬁcant. Yet, once death rates are computed a peak
appears which coincides with the end of the yolk sac phase as indeed shown by the
starvation curve.
A smilar effect can be found in the data published by a team led by Susana Garrido
(2015) who reared 820 larvae of European sardines (Sardina pilchardus) in labora-
tory conditions and recorded the number of deaths every day from hatching of the
eggs to 60 days later. For sardines the yolk sac phase lasts until they are 3 days old.
On the curve of the death rate as a function of age (not shown here) there is a de-
crease between t = 0 and 5 days, followed by a sudden surge in the interval (5, 8) in
which the death rate is multiplied by 2. Then, the fall is resumed and continues until
day 60. In short, the mortality spike follows the depletion of the yolk sac with a time
lag of about 2 days.

Longer yolk-sac phases: redﬁsh, sturgeons and salmons
As the yolk-sac mechanism is common to all ﬁshes which lay eggs, many data should
be available. Of particular interest would be the larvae of salmons for in this case
the yolk sac stage lasts about 60 days. At that late age the death spike should be
particularly visible and clear. For the present investigation one needs daily data
for populations reared in laboratory conditions. We can offer the prediction that
whenever appropriate data become available the death rate of salmons should show
a peak around the age of 60 days. Let us hope the present paper may encourage the
publication of such data.
In this subsection we present data for redﬁsh (Fig. 3a,b) and sturgeons (Fig. 4a,b). In
both cases the yolk-sac phase lasts about 12 days. Redﬁsh have the additional interest

Fig. 2a,b Yolk sac mortality spike for larvae of California anchovy. Left: Survival curve of larvae of
California anchovy (Engraulis mordax). The larvae were reared in four 10 liter containers containing seawater
and 100 eggs. The thin (green) lines are the survival curves for the four containers. The thick black line is their
average m and the error bars indicate plus and minus the standard deviation of the average. The ﬁrst insert
shows two larvae (not of E. mordax but of salmons which have a larger amount of yolk) shortly after birth with
their yolk sacs, while the second shows a larva of E. mordax whose length is 9mm which corresponds to an age
of 18 days. Right: The thin lines display the experimental points. The thick (blue) line is a 3-point centered
moving average. The peak between days 3 and 8 follows the depletion of the food reserve contained in the yolk
sac. The (red) line with the squares corresponds to an experiment in which no food was given; it shows that
there is a time lag of about 3 days between food depletion and ensuing mortality. Source: Lasker et al. 1970

that, in contrast with the majority of ﬁsh, the fertilization occurs internally and the
female spawns swimming larvae rather than eggs. However, from our perspective
this makes little difference because the larvae carry a yolk-sac just as when hatching
occurs externally.
The data provided by Laurel et al. (2001) have a good side but also two drawbacks.
The good side is the fact that they include data for an unfed group which allows
us to know fairly exactly the moment when the depletion of the yolk-sac becomes
effective. However, one drawback is the fact that the small number of individuals
in each sample (namely 200 larvae) leads to fairly large statistical ﬂuctuations. The
second drawback is even more serious. It consists in the fact that the larvae were
collected offshore and were “stripped from ripe females” collected by a ﬁshing ship.
As not all females were exactly at the same stage this collection method created large
time lags. This in turn led to fairly broad peaks extending over nearly 10 days. This
effect is particularly obvious for Sebastes mentella.

What makes the data of Gisbert et al. (2000) of particular interest is the fact that they
rely on samples of 2,500 larvae, i.e. ten times more than in the previous experiment.
However, as this experiment (as well as all others) was not designed for the purpose

Fig. 3a,b Yolk mortality spike for two species of redﬁsh larvae Left: Sebastes mentella ; Right: Sebastes
fasciatus. Each curve corresponds to a sample of 200 larvae. The red curves with the squares show the per-
centages of survivors when no food is given to them even after their yolk-sac is depleted. In both graphs, in
accordance with expectation, the mortality peak of nourished ﬁsh occurs in synchronicity with the collapse of
a population that is not nourished. Source: Laurel et al. 2001, p. 889

for which we are now using it, there is also a downside, namely the fact that there
is no unfed sub-sample. This means that one cannot identify exactly the end of the
yolk-sac phase.

For sturgeons the yolk sac phase lasts about 10-12 days which, although much shorter
than the 60 days of salmons, is substantially longer than in the cases of anchovy
or sardines. As shown in Fig. 4a the transition from endogenous to exogenous
feeding is marked by a major death peak. The fact that the transition is distributed
over 2 days results in a kind of moving average; in other words, if all larvae were
synchronized the peak would likely be much sharper. This can be veriﬁed (Fig. 4b)
by superposing dispersed spikes and noting that the global curve is fairly close to the
observed mortality rate.. Incidentally, in the same paper the author demonstrate that
there is a correlation of 0.63 between the diameter of the eggs and the time until ﬁrst
exogenous feeding. That property can possibly be used to improve synchronicity.

Summary of noteworthy cases
Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of cases already explored in which the pre-
dictions based on the Transient Shock conjecture were conﬁrmed by observation. It
gives also two examples for which appropriate observations have not yet been made
(at least to our best knowledge).

Age (days post-hatching)

Fig. 4a,b Yolk mortality spike for Siberian sturgeon larvae. Left: Each experiment involved 2,700 eggs.
The duration between spawning and hatching of the eggs was 7 days, After hatching the ﬁsh lived for 9-11 days
on the food reserve of their yolk sac. The transition to exogenous feeding was marked by a major death peak.
Right: The fact that the observed death rate does not look like the spike of Fig. 1a can be due to a dispersion in
the age of reaching the stage of exogenous feeding. The curves at the bottom (thin green lines) are hyperbolic
death spikes of the form 1/(t − d)γ. The (green) dot-dash line is their sum. The (blue) solid line is the same
curve as in (a). The graph shows that the superposition of the spikes produces a global curve that is fairly close
to the observed curve. For the sake of simplicity we assumed a uniform dispersion of the time-lag d; the real
(albeit unknown) distribution of d is probably not uniform. Source: Gisbert et al. 2000, p. 89.

Gompertz’s law was discovered in 1825. Benjamin Gompertz was involved in the
business of life insurance. That comes hardly as a surprise because Gompertz’s law
has an obvious usefulness for various forms of life insurances. Ever since it was
discovered in 1825 the study of Gompertz’s law has attracted considerable attention.
In contrast, the study of infant mortality was fairly neglected. A testimony of this
neglect can be found in a paper by Raymond Pearl and his collaborators (1941).
In the conclusion it is stated that the life curves of the beetle Tribolium confusum
“resemble in their fundamental pattern human life curves more closely than those
of any other organism for which life tables have been computed”. Yet, as will be
seen shortly, the infant mortality curves of Tribolium differ completely from human
curves.
The little interest for infant mortality curves can be attributed mainly to three cir-
cumstances.

(1) Whereas age-speciﬁc death rates over the age of 35 form a straight line in
a semi-log (x, log y) plot, infant death rates form a straight line in a log-log plot.
This means that the age-speciﬁc infant death rate is a hyperbolic power law whose
determination requires data points as close as possible to the moment of birth. We
will see below that for human populations hour-by-hour postnatal death rate data are

Notes: “C” means that the prediction was conﬁrmed. Incubation refers to the time between spawning and
hatching. The times in the columns “End of” and “Predicted” are expressed in post-hatch days. The data given
in the references were collected for various objectives (e.g. inﬂuence of type of food, ecotoxicology) which
were quite different from the present purpose. Cases 1-6 correspond to ﬁsh whereas 7 refers to a 1mm-long
worm. C. elegans has a much shorter life span than the ﬁsh: 20 days versus 15 years for sardines (and even
longer for turbots or sturgeons) which means that days have to be replaced by by 5mn- or 10mn-long time
intervals. The scientiﬁc names are as follows: 1=Engraulis mordax, 2=Sardina pilchardus, 3=Scophthalmus

now available but such data are relatively recent.

(2) Whereas old-age mortality has not been substantially affected by medical
progress, infant mortality has been drastically reduced over the past century. Around
1900 infant mortality during the ﬁrst year of life was still of the order of 150 per
1,000; nowadays in most industrialized countries it has been reduced to around 3 per
1,000. At ﬁrst sight it might seem that a variable that is so strongly dependent upon
external factors does not have much intrinsic biological interest. However, as will
be seen below, in spite of the huge reduction in magnitude, the shape of the death
rate has remained the same. In other words, if we write the death rate as A/tγ, the
numerator A has been divided by a large factor, the initial point has remained almost
the same, and the exponent γ has changed only slowly.

(3)

Infant mortality is deﬁned as being mortality after birth whereas mortality
occurring between conception and birth is called fetal mortality. Because for the
ﬁrst months after conception fetal mortality data are very uncertain, this variable
is not considered as very signiﬁcant. Nevertheless, in ecological studies mortality
estimates usually cover the whole period after the production of eggs. This is for
instance the methodological option used by Itˆo (1980). Unfortunately, with such an
option survivorship curves loose almost all signiﬁcance. The reason is easy to under-

12

stand. Many organisms, particularly insects and ﬁshes, produce a large number of
eggs of which many die within a short time5. Under such conditions all data points
for later life will be conﬁned in a narrow range even if one uses a logarithmic scale.

Two classes of explanations
Later we show that the decrease of infant mortality has the same shape as in humans
for various animal species: monkeys, lambs, birds, even crocodilians albeit with
a different exponent. However, the rule is not valid for insects whose development
proceeds through successive life stages. For the sake of brevity, species which follow
the power law decrease will be referred to as infant mortality power law (IMPOL)
species.

For IMPOL species, this raises the question of the origin of this similarity. Two
possible mechanisms come to mind.
• It may be that IMPOL species share similar initial biological “defects” which
are then “ﬁltered out” through the infant mortality process. This will be called ex-
planation A.
• Alternatively, it may be that there is a great variety of lethal effects that may
differ between individuals and species, but that they have some properties in common
which ensure that their global effect in the course of time will take the power law
form that we observe. This situation, which will be referred to as explanation B,
would be similar to the addition of non-identical random variables whose global
contribution, according to the central-limit theorem of probability theory, takes the
form of a Gaussian variable.

From technical devices to biological systems

Examples of causes of failure
When a collection of technical devices are put into operation at the same time t0
a fairly high failure rate is usually observed during a length of time that reliability
engineers call the infant mortality phase. One by one, in the course of time, items
which have a defect will fail. It is important to recognize that the length of time that
it takes for defects to manifest themselves can be very variable.
Let us give two examples which illustrate this point.
• First, we consider incandescent light bulbs. The light is produced by a wire
ﬁlament heated to a high temperature by an electric current I passing through it.
Suppose that at some point the section σ1 of the ﬁlament is smaller than the average

5For instance, as a fairly extreme case, the Atlantic mackerel, (Scomber scombrus), lays about one million eggs of

which only a few survive until 70 days after laying.

13

section σ. The amount of heat produced in one second per unit of length of the
ﬁlament is given by h = rI 2 where r = ρ/σ is the the resistance per unit of length of
the ﬁlament (ρ is the resistivity of tungsten). A reduction in σ will bring about a local
increase in resistance, this in turn will produce a higher heat release and push up local
temperature. Around this hot spot the evaporation of tungsten will be faster. Sooner
or later, this positive feedback process will lead to the severance of the ﬁlament and
the failure of the lamp.
As this mechanism is familiar to all physicists, one may wonder why we explained
it in some detail. The reason is very simple. We wished to point out that there is a
correspondence between σ1 and the life-time, θ(σ1), of the lamp. Before elaborating
further we wish to present a second illustration.
• Consider a device which contains one or several spinning wheels and suppose
that one of the axes is slightly off center. This will result in vibrations which, sooner
or later, will damage the wheel and lead to the failure of the whole device. Here too,
there will be a one-to-one correspondence between the magnitude of the defect, δ,
and the time to failure θ(δ) of the device.

Mathematical description of the distribution of failure times
Let us consider more closely what the existence of the functions θ(σ1) or θ(δ) implies
for a large sample of devices. In reliability studies one is usually interested in the
average life-time (also called mean time to failure or MTTF) of a device. In the
present paper we wish to go further in the sense that, instead of its mere average, we
will study the statistical distribution of the life-times. This means that for a cohort
of S0 = 1, 000 items which start to work at the same moment, we wish to know how
many will fail in the ﬁrst second, ﬁrst minute, ﬁrst hour and so on.

Mathematically, the statistical distribution of life-times can be described in a number
of ways which are fairly equivalent. One possible description is through the decrease
in the course of time of the number of survivors S = St. Although, this survivorship
description is commonly adopted especially in biology (see for instance Itˆo 1980) it
is not very suggestive because all these survivorship curves are of course decreasing
functions. A more suggestive representation is through the evolution of the death
rate µ as a function of age. The death rate is deﬁned as:

µ(t) = (1/St) (∆St/∆t)

where ∆t denotes a given age interval.
However, in medical statistics the postnatal death rate is deﬁned by replacing in the
previous formula St by S0:

µb(t) = (1/S0) (∆St/∆t)

14

Usually during the infant phase St and S0 are not very different which means that
µ(t) ≃ µb(t). However when St becomes much smaller than S0, the two formula
may lead to fairly different death rate shapes (see Appendix A).

Black box style explanations of the failure rate pattern
With these deﬁnitions in mind, let us come back to the example of the light bulbs. So
far, we have considered one lamp, now we consider a sample of lamps. Suppose that
all their ﬁlaments are exactly identical with (as before) a section that is reduced to σ1
at one point. As a result they will have the same time to failure θ1 which means that
for all lamps their failure rate µb(t) will be zero for t < θ1 and equal to 1 for t = θ1.
In reality the ﬁlaments cannot be completely identical. If the minima σ1 are dis-
tributed according to a density function f (σ1) it will result in a density function
f (θ1) which in turn determines the function µb(t). So, there is a one-to-one corre-
spondence between the proﬁle f (σ1) of the ﬁlaments and the shape of µb(t).
The data presented in the following sections suggest that µb(t) ∼ 1/tγ. To explain
such a fairly “exotic” behavior it might be tempting to assume a fairly complex inter-
nal structure of the system. For instance, in the work of Gavrilov et al. (2006) degrees
of redundancy are assumed which are achieved by identical subsystems working in
parallel. In other papers (e.g. Peleg et al. 1998) it is assumed that there is a whole
range of failure effects, each one characterized by a speciﬁc distribution curve.

The light bulb example suggests that a single cause of failure involving one param-
eter (e.g. the local diameter of the wire) is sufﬁcient to explain any shape of µb(t),
no matter how exotic. Naturally, the fact that one cause of failure may be sufﬁcient
does not imply that there is indeed only one cause of failure. However, the previous
argument tells us that before turning to complex internal structures one should rather
try to get a better knowledge of the most likely causes of failure.

Conversely, it results from the previous discussion, that the shape of the infant death
rate as a function of age gives information on the failure mechanisms at work in the
system. In other words, postnatal death rates are also an exploration tool.

Human infant mortality

Hyperbolic power law fall of postnatal rates: can one predict the exponent?
Human data are far more detailed than for any other living organism.
Fig. 1b and Fig. 5a,b show that the postnatal death rate has kept its power law shape
in spite of a considerable reduction in the global level of infant mortality. This is
shown for Switzerland from 1885 to 2013 and for Britain from 1921 to 2010.
The factor which determines the exponent of the power law appears fairly clearly on

Fig. 5a,b Postnatal death rates from 1 day to the age of 15 years. Left: Switzerland: Comparison of the
two curves for the ﬁrst 16 days of life suggests that the section of the curve for times shorter than 5 hours after
birth has remained unchanged despite medical progress. The slope of the regression line for the ﬁrst 12 months
is γ = 0.85 ± 0.04; this slope is almost the same as for the ﬁrst 4 days; regarding the days 5 to 16, so far we
have no explanation for why there is a level section; for the ﬁrst 15 years the slope is γ = 1.12 ± 0.14. Right:
England and Wales (1921-2010). Comparison of the curves shows also that in spite of a huge decrease in infant
mortality, the age-speciﬁc pattern remained basically the same. The end of the decrease around the age of 10
years (i.e. some 4,000 days) marks the limit of what in this paper we call the infant phase. As the fetal phase
would correspond to negative ages, the magnitude of the late fetal rate is indicated in a fairly schematic way,
basically for the purpose of comparison with postnatal rates. From top to bottom the slopes of the regression
lines are γ = 0.75 ± 0.05, γ = 1.16 ± 0.12, and γ = 1.19 ± 0.1 respectively. Sources: Switzerland: The
following website of the “Federal Ofﬁce of Statistics”:
http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/fr/index/infothek/lexikon/lex/2.html
provides a compilation of historical series and in particular it contains all the annual issues of “Mouvement de
la population de la Suisse” [i.e. Vital statistics of Switzerland] starting in 1877. The data for the ﬁrst 16 days
are from the volume of 1885. The data for the ﬁrst 12 months are from the “Annuaire Statistique de la Suisse”
[Statistical Yearbook of Switzerland] (p. 75). Britain: Child mortality statistics, 2013, Table 1 and Table 17,

Fig. 1b and Fig. 5a,b. It is not determined by what happens immediately after birth
but rather by the death rate at the end of the infant mortality phase. Indeed, it can
be seen that in the close vicinity of birth (i.e. for a few hours after birth) all death
rate curves converge toward the same point. In order to see this effect most clearly
one needs series for the same country which start as soon as possible after birth and
which are widely apart in the course of time. The Swiss data shown in Fig. 5a turn
out to best fulﬁll these conditions.

This is another instance of a ﬁxed point model that we discussed in the context of old
age in Richmond et al. (2016a). Here, the exponent of the power law will become
higher when the death rate at age 10-15 decreases. Historically, this is what hap-
pened in western countries during the 20th century. In the perspective of transversal

16

analysis the same effect tells us that γ will be smaller in developing countries than in
developed countries. Testing these predictions may become the purpose of a subse-
quent paper.

How shortly after birth does the hyperbolic law start?
Mathematically, an hyperbolic law 1/tγ cannot hold until t = 0; there must be a
cut-off time tc prior to which another law sets in. Fig. 6a shows that tc is of the order
of 1 hour.

Fig. 6a,b Infant death rate in Switzerland from one hour after birth to the age of 12 years. Left: From
one hour after birth to 28 days after birth (neonatal mortality). If one leaves apart the ﬁrst hour, the following
7 hours are characterized by a much steeper slope than later times. This effect can be “explained” in terms of
prematurity. Right: With its much broader time scale this graph gives the global picture over the whole interval
marked by a decrease of the infant death rate. The slopes of the log-log regression lines for the 3 power law
cases are as follows: all death: 0.97 ± 0.12, malformations: 1.12 ± 0.07, infectious disease: 0.69 ± 0.10. On
each curve the 6 data points are averages over the following age intervals. Days: (0 − 0.9), (1 − 6.9), (7 −
27.9), (28 − 364.9); years: (1 − 4.9), (5 − 9.9), (10 − 14.9). The curves refer to males and are averages over
the 19 years 1995-2013. Source: Swiss Federal Ofﬁce of Statistics.

We see that the end of the decrease phase occurs in the age interval 10-14 years.
After that age the death rate starts to increase, slowly at ﬁrst and then after the age of
30 it assumes an exponential growth in accordance with Gompertz’s law.

Infant death rates by cause of death
Since 1995 the Swiss Federal Statistical Ofﬁce publishes daily, weekly, monthly and
yearly infant death rates by cause of death. The list has about 20 entries which
fall into two broad classes. (i) Congenital malformations, e.g. of the nervous or
circulatory system (ii) Diseases, e.g.
infectious diseases, cancer, diseases of the
digestive system, neuropathies.

Not surprisingly, the malformation category is largely predominant in the earliest
part of life. As a matter of fact, the number of deaths due to diseases is so small that
in order to get signiﬁcant estimates one needs to add up the death numbers for all the
19 years for which data are available.
As an illustration let us compare deaths from cancer, and congenital malformations.

Notes: It can be seen that the death numbers move in opposite directions: up for cancer, down for malforma-
tions. However malformations remain important even several years after birth.
Source: Swiss Federal Ofﬁce of Statistics.

Table 3 shows that the number of deaths for the two causes move in opposite direc-
tions; thus, clearly, they cannot be ruled by the same law. In fact, the daily deaths
by cancer ﬁrst start to decline and then level off around the age of one year. So,
why does one observe a power law for total death numbers? The reason is suggested
by Table 3: during the ﬁrst day the deaths from malformations are 60 times more
frequent than those from cancer. Subsequently the deaths due to malformations de-
crease but even years after birth, e.g. for the age group (1 year - 4.9 years), they
remain quite signiﬁcant and indeed of the same order of magnitude as the deaths
from cancer.
Fig. 6b shows that unlike cancer deaths which do not follow a power law, deaths
from infectious diseases follow a power law. It is true that there are ﬂuctuations but
there is no systematic deviation. The exponent for diseases is somewhat lower than
the exponent of total deaths:

γ(infection) = 0.69 ± 0.10,

γ(total) = 0.97 ± 0.12

This observation raises a question. What would be the shape of the infant mortality
curve during an outbreak of infectious disease of the kind that occurred at the end
of the 19th century? One would expect a curve that would be a composition of
malformation and infectious deaths. This should give a power law in two parts with
γ close to 1 immediately after birth and then around 0.7 for ages between 2 and 10.
Once data become available it will be possible to check this prediction.

Incidence of birthweight
Previously we have seen that the exponent γ was not really constant but was rather
declining with age. This materialized in two ways (i) In Fig. 6a we saw a sharp bent
after 7 hours; (ii) in Fig. 6b, because of the averaging process, the decline of γ was

18

smaller but nevertheless visible.
Fig. 6a suggests that the change in γ should be attributed to prematurity. Indeed, in
the case of pre-term birth, not only is the death rate higher (which is hardly surpris-
ing) but also the γ is higher. The reason is easy to understand. Ultimately, after a
few years, all infants, whether preterm or not, will tend to have the same weight and
same death rate. Such a convergence is already visible in Fig. 7a in spite of the fact
that it covers only one year. On the other hand, the initial death rate level of pre-term
babies is in proportion of their degree of prematurity. Thus, inevitably, the slope γ
must be higher for large initial death rates.

Fig. 7a,b Incidence of low birthweight on death rates. Left: Low birthweight (which is usually associated
with preterm birth) results not only in higher levels of death rate but also in higher exponents. As explained
in the text, the two effects are in fact closely connected. Right: There is a linear relationship between the

prematurity index p and the exponent γ which takes the form: γ = −ap + b,
Source: Swiss Federal Ofﬁce of Statistics.

Fig. 7b summarizes the relationship between prematurity and the exponent γ. The
prematurity index used for the horizontal axis of Fig. 7b was deﬁned as: p =
(gestational age at birth)/(9 months). Then, the regression line follows the equation:

γ = −ap + b,

a = 2.0 ± 0.2, b = 2.90 ± 0.02

(1)

This relationship is deﬁned with high accuracy as shown by the small size of the
error bars for a and b.
It would be really surprising that a relationship that holds with such accuracy for
humans would not hold as well for other mammals. Of course, the coefﬁcients a and
b will not be exactly the same but one would expect a linear relationship to hold with
good precision.

19

The next step would be to set up an experiment specially designed to observe this
effect and to measure a, b with good accuracy. Until this is done, we must rely on
makeshift data extracted from experiments which were conducted for a completely
different purpose. As an illustration, one can mention an experiment described in a
paper by Price et al. (1972). In this paper the authors measured the death rate of
monkeys (Macaca mulatta, Macaca fascicularis, Macaca artoides) at age 0− 8 days
and 8 − 30 days for different classes of birthweights. As the number of births is
not very large (only 91 for the 3 species) the data shown in the paper display large
random ﬂuctuations. By lumping together successive birthweight classes, keeping
only two, the ﬂuctuations could be reduced substantially. As a result, one gets a
relationship similar to (1) with the following coefﬁcients:
a = 4.3, b = 5.8

There are probably substantial error bars for a, b but they could not be estimated
because the regression line is deﬁned by two points only.

γ = −ap + b,

The following sections are devoted to non-human living organisms. We will proceed

Fig. 8 Postnatal mortality of piglets. The slope of the regression line is −1.6±0.4. The data are from a study
of the US “National Animal Health Monitoring System” (NAHMS) for 1990. The dotted part of the curve is a
schematic representation of the spike (age 0 and negative ages can of course not be displayed on a log-scale).
As fetal death rates of piglets are not well documented the level was set to a value similar to late fetal rate in
humans. Source: US Dept of Agriculture 1992.

For farmers early deaths of farm animals represent a substantial economic loss. In the
United States and Australia about 16% of the new born piglets died before reaching
the age of one month. This led to studies done by the Departments of Agriculture

20
whose main aim was to understand the causes of death6.

As a by-product these studies gave death rates by age which allowed us to check
whether they follow a power law or not. The power law shape was conﬁrmed (Fig.
8) with exponents summarized in Table 4.

Apart from the studies concerning farm animals there are few sources from which
one can get accurate data about infant mortality for animals. One other important
source consists in the records from zoological gardens. It is this source that will be
used in the two following subsections.

Primates

Primates are one of the main attractions of zoos and it is not surprising therefore that
major zoological gardens have large populations of species of this taxon7. Primates
have the additional interest of being a kind of stepping-stone between humans and
other, more distant, mammals. For all these reasons primates warrant a close look.

Postnatal death rates for various species of primates
As the detailed data that we needed were not available8 one of the authors (V.P.)
conducted a special investigation using registers from the London Zoo called Daily
Occurrences. These records are available at the Archives of the Zoological Society
of London. These data record the arrivals and departures of animals on a daily basis.

6For instance the study about lamb mortality revealed that overcrowded pens lead to a high mortality due to the ewes

laying on their lambs. This cause of death represented 25% of the deaths which occurred from day 1 to day 7.

7A taxon is a group of species with some common characteristics. More details can be found in Campbell and Reece

2004, p. 767-769.

8Later on we will use some data published in Kohler et al. (2006); these data have the advantage of being available for
a broad range of species but they have a poor time resolution in the sense that they give infant mortality data only for the
ages of one week and one year.

It can be added that in a general way primates get particularly close attention.

Fig. 9a shows that all small primates investigated follow similar power laws with an
exponent which, on average is equal to γ = 1.24 ± 0.2.

Consistency of separate data sets
In physics it is the rule that an experiment done by one team is repeated9 and checked
by one or several other researchers. In biology this is fairly rare and in the social
sciences it is exceedingly rare. Here, however, we have the opportunity to carry

9Yet, never exactly in the same way in the sense that the devices and measurement methods are not the same. Taken
together, these experiments will show what are the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for observing the effect under
consideration. In other words, these semi-repetitions deﬁne the envelop of parameters within which the effect occurs.

Fig. 9b Infant mortality rates of primates. For the whole group of small primates the graph provides a
comparison between two separate data sets.
It is reassuring to see that they show a good agreement. The
comparison provides a welcome conﬁrmation of the data of Kohler et al. (2006), a check that is all the more
useful due to the fact that they consist in only 3 data points of which only 2 can be considered as pertaining to
infant mortality. Sources: Archives of the Zoological Society of London, Kohler et al. (2006).

out such a comparison for the case of small primates. The two observations were
performed independently and rely on data that differ in several respects.
• The time periods are not the same: 1970-2000 versus 1998-2003. This has an
incidence on the manner of recording the data. During the 1970-2000 period the data
were mostly recorded by hand whereas 1998-2003 already belongs to the digital era.
• The zoos are not the same: London zoo versus various zoos in North America
and Europe. Not only are the animals not the same but even the species are not
exactly the same although there is of course a broad overlap. The species belonging
to the “small primate” category considered by Kohler et al. are listed on p. 416 of
their paper.
• Finally, the sources of the data are not the same: Daily Occurrences of the
London zoo versus “International Species Information System” (ISIS). We will say
more about ISIS in a moment.

In short, the quasi-coincidence of the two data sets is a good testimony of the ro-
bustness of this kind of observations. In particular it shows that despite limited data
points the observations collected compiled by Kohler et al. (2006) reﬂect fairly well
the overall shape of the infant mortality rates as a function of age.

A second conﬁrmation can be mentioned. In a paper by Hird et al. (1975) we are
told that “the neonatal mortality rate was 10.8%, and the post-neonatal mortality rate
(deaths between 31-183 days) was 6.9%. These data allows us to compute γ. One

23

gets: γ = 1.06 which is quite consistent with the previous results.

Finally, it must be mentioned that we also came across a paper whose results are
inconsistent with the previous ones. The study by Shaughnessy et al. (1978) gives the
following distribution of deaths over the 4 ﬁrst weeks after birth: w1 = 24%, w2 =
59%, w3 = 17%, w4 = 9.6%. The fact that w1 < w2 is in contradiction with all
observations that we have reported so far. Secondly, although w2, w3, w4 follow a
power law, the corresponding exponent is equal to 2.6 which is much higher than the
exponents seen so far. These data relied on births which occurred between 1966 and
1972 at the breeding colony of the “Litton Bionetics” company in Maryland. One
is tempted to think that this population of Macaca mulata was “special” in some
respect. In order to get a clearer understanding, additional information would be
needed about the conditions prevailing at that breeding center.

Broader view of animals kept in zoos

The dataset used in the paper by Kohler et al. (2006) was not designed to study
infant mortality. This is shown clearly by the fact already mentioned that there are
only 3 (very distant) data points: 1 week, 1 year and 2 years. Without the control
test performed in the previous subsection it would have been hazardous to use them
to study postnatal mortality. However, encouraged by the consistency seen for small
primates we have considered other subgroups. The results are summarized in Fig.
10.
One can learn two things from this graph.

(1) The infant death rates are much more regular and uniform than the death rates

of mid/old age (we come back to this point below). They are also much higher.

(2) With respect to the exponent γ, of the 8 subgroups there are two which emerge
as quite different, namely kangaroos and crocodilians. The average of the 6 others
is (with probability level 0.95): γm = 1.02 ± 0.12. The case of the crocodilians is
particularly spectacular because they have not only a lower slope but also a much
lower overall death rate.

Why do the mid/old age rates show such a high dispersion? Two answers come to
mind.
It may be due to the well known fact that aging processes are very diverse, as shown
by the classiﬁcation of survivorship curves into three types I, II, III, not to mention
all kinds of intermediate types.
There may be a second reason. A look at the ISIS records shows that most of the
animals do not spend their whole life in the same zoo; instead they are repeatedly
loaned (or sold) by one zoo to another. This may be disturbing for the animals but

Fig. 10 Infant mortality rates versus mid-age rates. The scales for the mid/old age rates are given by the
axis on the right-hand side and the top axis. The numbers which precede the names of the subgroups are the
exponents γ of the power law for the infant death rates. Despite the fact that there are only 3 data points, thanks
to the good correlations, the error bars (at probability level 0.95) are only about ±8% on average. Source of the
data: Kohler et al. (2006).

it raises also a book keeping problem. In the paper by Kohler et al.
(p. 429) it
is reported that even highly visible animals such as gorillas “are assigned multiple
identiﬁcation numbers in various regions around the world”. What occurs for gorillas
is also likely to occur for other species. The only difference may be that for low
proﬁle species the inaccuracies in the records remain unnoticed.

Insects

Before becoming adult, insects go through several life stages: (i) embryo, (ii) larva,
(iii) pupa (or nymph which has already the form of an adult but not yet its size) and
(iv) ﬁnally adult. According to our deﬁnition of the infant mortality we will consider
only the adult stage, i.e. the stage which leads to sexual maturity. The nymphal stage
should be included in the adult stage because the nymph has already all the properties

25

of the adult.

In each such transformations the insects are exposed to changing external situations.
From caterpillar (larval form) to butterﬂy there is clearly a drastic change in environ-
mental conditions. In other words, there are several ﬁltration processes which may
be independent or inter-dependent.

Now, let us have a look at some data.

Successive instars
The best test is provided by successive instars. It can be recalled that in its nymphal
stage, an insect has already its adult shape but because of the rigidity of its outside
cuticle, in order to achieve its adult size, it must undergo several molts. The phase
between two successive molts is called an instar. Often there are up to 5 or 6 instars.
The last instar is the adult. Itˆo (1980) gives several survivorship curves on which
successive instars are plotted. It appears that often the screening between the ﬁrst and
second instar is weaker (in the sense of a smaller µ(t)) than the screening following
the hatching which produced the ﬁrst instar. As an illustration one can mention
the case of Mogannia minuta (sugar cane cicada) as particularly clear (p. 84). As
the survivorship curves drawn by Itˆo were not designed to study this speciﬁc issue,
they do not have the required accuracy in the sense that most instar death rates are
compressed within a narrow interval. One would need the original data. We leave
this question open for further examination.

Beetle
Finally, we consider the case of a beetle, namely “Tribolium confusum Duval” (Pearl
et al. 1941). It can be noted that (as shown in Pearl’s paper) the survival curves
of males and females in late age are very different. The 50% proportion is reached
for 170 versus 210 days respectively whereas the 10% proportion is reached for 410
versus 375 days respectively. In contrast during their infant phase, male and female
rates display parallel changes. This, once again, illustrates the fact that infant mortal-
ity is “simpler” (in the sense of being less affected by exogenous factors) than aging.
The fact that Fig. 11 does not display a power law suggests that a different mecha-
nism is at work.

Plants and trees

In its principle, the process which leads from a tiny embryo to a seedling does not
much differ from what we see in the growth of ﬁsh or mammal embryos. It is marked
by similar steps of division and differentiation. For many (yet not all) plants the
growth of the embryo continues for a given time interval after the formation of the

seed. This means that germination cannot occur immediately. If, for some reason,
this delay is not respected the seedling will face a prematurity problem just as in
human premature births.

Yolk sac effect in plants
In the time interval between germination and formation of roots and leaves, the nu-
trients contained in the seed play the same role as the yolk sac for ﬁsh larvae10. This
parallelism is described in the following lexikon.

Notes: Despite the different vocabulary there is a strong parallelism between the successive phases. The two
terms given for the yolk sac phase reﬂect the difference between plants whose seed germinate under or over the
surface of the soil (they are called hypogeal or epigeal species).

Therefore one would not expect the death spike to occur right at germination but
rather when the nutrients contained in the seeds are exhausted. The accuracy of the
data that we were able to ﬁnd so far is too low to allow this prediction to be tested.

10For instance, according to Hanley et al. (2004), this phase lasts about 11 days for sunﬂowers (Helianthus annuus) and
12 days for pea (Pisum sativum). Thus, one should observe a mortality spike in the interval 10d-15d after germination.
Its amplitude may be small (perhaps about 1%) but should be visible on samples of 1,000 seeds or more.

27

The hyperbolic power law effect
Plants are simpler than insects whose development goes through several successive
stages. Moreover, ﬁeld observations of plants are easier to perform and are more
reliable than observations on animals for the obvious reason that unlike animals,
plants do not move around11. Yet, surprisingly, very few life tables have been set up
for plants. In 1975, Valen wrote “Although the study of survivorship [curves] has
been an important part of animal ecology for 30 or 40 years, there are few studies on
plants”. The same observation still basically holds in 2015.

Field observation of palm trees
The results for the palm trees Enterpe globosa studied by Valen are summarized in
the graph of Fig. 12. Two features are of particular interest.
• As for humans, the age interval during which the death rate decreases roughly
coincides with the period before sexual maturity.
• The death rate follows a power law fairly accurately. The (log t, log µb) corre-
lation is 0.998. Yet, with an exponent equal to γ = 2.6 ± 0.4 the decrease is almost
three times steeper than in previous cases. Is this property shared by other big trees?
A further discussion can be found in Appendix C of the version of the paper available
on arXiv.

a height of 20 meters. The observations were made in Puerto Rico. Instead of being close to one as for most
other cases, it is close to 2.5. At this point we do not know why. Source: Valen (1975, p. 263)

11However, for plants a major difﬁculty is how to deﬁne the moment of death. For plants which exhibit positive

phototropism. the termination of effect may be used to deﬁne death in a more accurate way than just by its aspect.

Conclusion

28

Main results
What we learned in this paper can be summarized in the following observations.

(1) General

(a) Infant mortality (in the sense of being a phase during which
the death rate decreases) is an ubiquitous phenomenon in living organisms. It was
shown to exist in mammals, ﬁsh and plants. (b) In all cases for which appropriate
data could be found, we have seen that there is a hyperbolic power law (i.e. 1/tγ
starting in the vicinity of t = 0 and then holding for large t) decrease of the death
rate. (c) The exponent γ is usually close to one. The plant instances in which we
found exponents as high as 3 need to be conﬁrmed by observations under controlled
conditions (i.e. no predating, appropriate supply of water, and so on).
(d) For most animal species it appears that there is much more regularity in infant
death patterns than in old-age death patterns.

(2) Yolk sac larvae The Transient Shock conjecture offered predictions regard-
ing the existence and timing of death rate spikes and these predictions were con-
ﬁrmed by observation.

(3) Humans

(a) What we called the hyperbolic power law starts to hold in the
second hour following birth. (b) The fact that in the hours following birth γ is of the
order of 2 rather than 1 can be explained by the effect of premature birth. (c) There
is a negative correlation between γ and the mortality rate in the 10-14 age group. (d)
If one makes a distinction between different causes of death, most of them follow
a power law, yet not necessarily with the same exponent. For instance, death due
to infectious disease is characterized by an exponent of 0.69 instead of 0.97 for the
all-causes curve. (e) There is a linear relationship between the index of prematurity
and the exponent γ.

(4) Primates For primates (and more generally for any mammals for which data

are available) one observes the same infant mortality pattern than for humans.

(5) Multi-stage organisms For insects in their adult life stage the mortality rate
does also decrease with age but it does not follow a power law. This may be due
to the fact that this stage was preceded by several selection processes (larva, pupa,
nymph).

Origin of the hyperbolic power law of mortality decrease
There is one question for which we have no answer so far, namely how can one
explain the origin of the power law decrease observed for the infant mortality rate, a
feature that is common to so many species. Two types of explanation come to mind.
• First, there is the ﬁltering effect of defective individuals that we have already
discussed (explanation of type A). This can be referred to as a static explanation
in the sense that it does not assume any transformation taking place in individual
organisms. A tentative model is outlined in the arXiv version of the present paper.

29
• Then, there is a dynamic explanation in which one assumes an improvement of
the immune system in the course of time. It is the immune system which ensures
survival in later life; in addition we know that vaccination actually works; therefore
it seems natural to assume that the effectiveness of the immune system improves
as individuals interact with the outside world and experience in small doses various
“nasty” microorganisms which trigger the emergence of antibodies. We also know
that this process takes time for at birth the immune system is largely under-developed
and newborn individuals have to rely on what is called passive immunity, namely
maternal antibodies transmitted to them.

In order to substantiate the second explanation one would need age-speciﬁc data for
vaccination effectiveness12. An alternative metric would be to measure the antibody
concentration in the blood of animals (which were not subject to vaccination) as a
function of their age.

Agenda for future research
We wish to stress the fact that for various organisms such as plants, bacteria, mi-
croorganisms, insects it would be relatively easy to set up infant mortality experi-
ments because, in contrast with the study of aging, the observation time can be much
shorter. Our plan is to build a chain of systems which starts from the simplest (e.g.
technical devices, plants, primitive animals such as C. elegans) and progressively
embraces more complicated systems. Such a program was already considered at the
end of the 19th century by Alfred Espinas (1878). As a matter of fact, at that time
it seemed to be a fairly natural idea to complement sociological investigations with
studies about other living organisms. Nowadays such an approach has become fairly
uncommon.

As an example of their interest, such experiments may shed new light on the hierar-
chical complexity structure of living organisms. Here again a parallel with technical
systems may help to explain this idea.

A modern airliner is made up of many functional components (wings, engine, com-
puter and so on). These components comprise large numbers of smaller elements
(screws, electronic chips and so on). In the last step of the building process the func-
tional components are put together on the assembly line. Finally, tests are performed
with the purpose of detecting possible defects.
In principle deﬁciencies may occur at the three levels: small elements, components,
assembly line. However, observation shows that the small elements have a very low
defect rate. This is fairly understandable because they are produced through standard

12It is deﬁned as E = 1 − Iv/Inv where Iv is the incidence of the disease under consideration (e.g. inﬂuenza) in the
vaccinated population and Inv is the incidence in the population that is not vaccinated. If not a single vaccinated person
gets the disease, E will be equal to 1.

manufacturing processes and are fairly easy to control. Similarly cell division seems
to be a very reliable generation process. There are some N = 3 × 1013 cells in the
human body (Bianconi et al. 2013, note that a large proportion of them are red blood
cells). On average 1% of them must be replaced every day. This raises the question
of what defect rate is acceptable. The answer is certainly highly organ dependent. A
defect rate of 1 per 1,000 may be quite acceptable for red blood cells but may not
allow an organ such as an eye to work properly. Needless to say, a component may
be defective even though all its elements are good. Similarly, if mistakes are made at
the assembly line level the aircraft may be defective even though all its components
are ﬂawless.
A careful analysis of postnatal death rates across various species may give useful
information about this multi-level organization

Appendix A: Infant mortality data

In this Appendix we ﬁrst discuss the deﬁnitions of mortality rates. Then, we explain
the conditions under which infant mortality should be measured. Finally, we give
some indications about possible data sources.

Deﬁnitions
In statistical sources death rates are computed in two different ways depending on
whether they concern infant mortality (deﬁned in the broad way of post-natal mor-
tality used in this paper) or not. The deﬁnitions are recalled in Fig. A1a. This can
create a good deal of confusion because a given survival function will lead to differ-
ent mortality patterns depending on which deﬁnition one uses. This is illustrated in
Fig. 1b for an exponential and a power law fall.

Deﬁnition of standard versus postnatal death rates

t : age (u = log t)
s(t) : survivors at age t
µ(t) : standard death rate
µb(t) : postnatal death rate

µ = | (1/s) (ds/dt)|
µb = |(1/s0)(ds/dt)|

y = log µ
yb = log µb

Fig. A1a Standard death rate (µ) and postnatal death rate (µb). The logarithms of the death rates, y, yb,
are used below in log-log plots.

For a power law, the curves of µ and µb have same shape but different exponents.
Intuitively, this is quite understandable because for a slow decrease of s(t) one has:

31

Exponential decrease
t ≥ t0 = 0 :

s(t) = s0e−λt

Power law decrease

t ≥ t0 > 0 :

s(t) = A/tρ, A = s0tρ

µb(t) = λe−λt
yb = log λ − λeu

µ(t) = λ
y = log λ

µb(t) = (Aρ/s0)(1/tρ+1)

Fig. A1b Log of infant death rate (yb = log µb) and of standard death rate (y = log µ) as a function
of u = log t. The shapes are shown in two typical cases: exponential and power law decrease of s(t). As
expected, µ(t) falls off slower than µb(t) for the simple reason that for any t > 0, the denominator s(t) is
smaller than s0.

µb ≃ µ; in most cases examined in this paper µb ∼ 1/t which means that rho is
close to zero and s(t) almost level during the infant mortality phase.
In the next subsection we explain that this dual deﬁnition is a consequence of how
the data are recorded.

Reason of the dual deﬁnition of mortality rates
The infant mortality deﬁnition is usually used for newborns under one year. We have
seen that the infant mortality phase (i.e. falling mortality) in fact extends until 10
years. So, why was a one year threshold selected?
The (standard) age-speciﬁc death rate is a ratio of two numbers: the numerator is
the number of deaths which occurred in one year in a given age-group (e.g. 15-19)
whereas the denominator is the number of (living) people in this age-group. The
ﬁrst number is provided by the death certiﬁcates while the second is provided by the
census.

Now, let us try to compute the death rate of newborn babies between 1 and 2 months
of age with the previous deﬁnition. There is no problem for the numerator because
death certiﬁcates give the date and time of birth and death which deﬁnes the age
at death with an accuracy of up to one hour. For the denominator one would need

r
32

the number of living newborns of that age. However, this number will have strong
monthly ﬂuctuations because of the seasonal variability of the birth rate. In other
words, this deﬁnition cannot be used and must therefore be replaced by another. In
order to get a rate the simplest way is to divide the deaths by the total number of live
births in the same year.

Over one year of age one can in principle use age-group census data but it should
be observed that, specially for young ages, the deﬁnition of an age group requires
a number of conventions. For instance, in order to compute ages one must deﬁne
(somewhat arbitrarily) a speciﬁc census date even though census operations may
take several months. This shows that the infant death rate is a simpler and clearer
concept than the standard death rate.

These deﬁnitions have another noteworthy implication. In the computation of an
infant death rate one needs to take into account the length of the age interval under
consideration. Thus, to get the rate per day for the age 1-2 months one will divide
the number of deaths not only by the live births but also by the length of the interval
expressed in days (i.e. 30 days). On the contrary, in computing the (standard) death
rate for the 14-19 age group the length of the interval (i.e. 5 years) is irrelevant
because the denominator refers to the same age group.

In search of “natural” infant mortality rates
For humans as well as other living organisms infant death rates may be inﬂated by
temporary diseases or epidemics. In addition, for species reared in laboratories or
zoos death rates may be ampliﬁed because the living conditions are not good enough.
For animals kept in zoos this can just be the result of a lack of space, whereas for
small species (e.g. ﬁsh larvae) it may be due to the fact that we do not well know
how to feed them.
On the other hand, especially in past decades, human infant mortality has been dras-
tically reduced thanks to medical progress. This led to the survival of babies afﬂicted
by malformations who would not have been viable otherwise.

This leads to the following practical rules for data selection.
• We discard all data collected in the ﬁeld that is to say in conditions (e.g. bad
weather, predators) which cannot be controlled.
• We discard the data recorded in populations in which the spread of a disease or
other inappropriate conditions have led to high mortality rates. For instance, there
are recurrent disease outbreaks in hatcheries, ﬁsheries or zoos.

Possible data sources
For reasons which are easy to understand the process of aging gets considerable at-
tention. Within the broader discipline of biodemography, gerontology has become a

33

ﬁeld in itself with its own journals (e.g. “Experimental Gerontology” or “Biogeron-
tology”). Yet, as observed by Levitis et al. (2013), “gerontologists focus on aging
and usually take neither data on, or interest in, the periods before adulthood”. Apart
from the gerontologists.
life tables are occasionally set up by ecologists. As an
example, one can cite the work of Itˆo (1980). We already mentioned the fact that
almost none of the life tables contained in his book can be used for studying infant
mortality. In this respect the key-requirement is to start the observations as shortly as
possible after birth or germination. If the ﬁrst data point refers to a few weeks after
birth (as is seen in many survivorship curves) the main part of the information will
be lost.

Suggested experiments
Although the data reported in the present paper cover a wide range of species, they
are all complex multicellular organisms. One would need empirical evidence for
“simpler” organisms. What organisms would be particularly appropriate?

Because of their relative simplicity, it is tempting to use unicellular organisms. In
some cases such as Euglena gracilis, a unicellular swimming organism about 50
micrometers in length, reproduction leads to clones of the parent organism. In other
cases, such as Paramecium caudatum a swimming organism about 100 micrometers
in length, the reproduction by division can lead to offsprings which are not identical
to the parent (through the process of an exchange of genetic material between two
organisms prior to division). However, no matter whether the children are clones
or not, there is the challenge of distinguishing those which died from those alive.
This, in different form, is the difﬁculty already discussed for plants. Unfortunately,
even for phototropic organisms (such as Euglena gracilis) there is always a small
percentage who do not respond to the stimulus which means that this method can
hardly be used.

Caenorhabditis elegans, a little worm about 1mm long which has only about one
thousand cells, would seem to be a good candidate. The adults lay eggs which hatch
after a few hours. The death rate in the 12 hours following hatching is about 4% per
day; it falls to about 1.5% per day in the following 16 hours (Smith 2011 p. 24, Tew
2008 p. 26). At sexual maturity it is at a minimum level of 1% from which it then
increases exponentially over a period of 30 days at the end of which it reaches 100%.

We hope that the publication of the present paper will lead other researchers to per-
form accurate measurements of infant mortality rates. We are conﬁdent that once
more observations become available covering a wide range of cases a clearer under-
standing will emerge.

Appendix B. Indications about possible models

As already noted, at this point of our investigation it is too early to propose a full
ﬂedged model. However, it may be useful to give some hints in order to start the
discussion.

The models delineated below are able to generate a power law under some more or
less plausible assumptions. However, to be honest, one must recognize that there
are probably many alternative models which can also generate power laws under
“plausible” assumptions, especially since plausibility is a fairly subjective notion. A
better criterion is to ask whether or not the models have a predictive power.

Models based on interdependent defects
We assume that at birth a living organism i has a number of defects, Fi which de-
termines its probability of dying. For instance, one may say: “An individual with
20 defects will die in one day, whereas one with only 5 defects will die in one
week”. For a population cohort of n individuals the average number of defects
1 Fi(t) and the assumption made at individual level will
will be: F (t) = (1/n)PN
translate into a relationship between F and the age-speciﬁc frequency of death in
the population, that is to say the (normalized) age-speciﬁc death rate µb(t). Through
this assumption the survival problem is reduced to a discussion regarding defect
numbers. A simple form of the functional relationship would be proportionality:
µb(t) = kF (t); this is what will be assumed thereafter but any increasing function
would be acceptable as well.

The assumption that the death rate is proportional to the average number of defects
is of course fairly natural, but now we must also explain why the death rate decreases
fastest when it is highest (namely immediately after birth) and then slower as indi-
viduals become older.

There are three mechanisms through which the average number of defects may de-
crease in the course of time.

(1) Through the death of individual i the term Fi will be reduced by zero. As the
ﬁrst individuals to die will be those with the largest numbers of defects the decrease
of the average will be fastest immediately after birth. The individuals who die after
a while may have only one or two defects so their deaths will reduce F very little.

(2) There will also be a self-correction mechanism. For instance, a major source
of defects is birth prematurity but for those newborns who remain alive, their defects
will correct themselves as they become older just because of natural maturation.

(3) An additional effect may concentrate the deaths shortly after birth, namely that
fact that the defects are certainly not independent. Incidentally, the interdependence
of defects may be experienced when executing computer code. A single mistake, e.g.

35

a variable that was not deﬁned, has a cascading effect and results in an avalanche or
error messages. Once this mistake is corrected, everything falls in order. The same
effect may happen in living organisms. For instance, suppose that for some reason
an organ O which produces an hormone H is underdeveloped because enzyme E is
in low supply. So, at this stage, there are 3 interdependent defects: low level of E,
underdeveloped organ O and low level of H. Then, by correcting the core defect E
the two other defects will fall in line: O will reach the right size and the concentration
of H will reach the right level.

It is reasonable to assume that defect interdependence is highest when Fi is largest.
Thus, self-correction will lead to a very fast decrease of F at the beginning as long
as individuals with many defects are present.

An argument which gives credence to such a mechanism is the close correlation that
is observed between low weight and premature birth. Instead of speaking of defect
numbers, this mechanism could be rephrased in terms of unﬁnished growth. If the
premature baby is kept in an incubator and fed appropriately, it will be able to ter-
minate its growth process. For instance, the lungs, one of the last organs to be com-
pleted, will eventually function properly with the consequence that the appropriate
level of oxygen will be delivered in the blood ﬂow. This will ipso facto result in the
improved working of many organs across the whole body. Naturally, this argument
does not apply to malformations which cannot be self-repaired.

Before closing the discussion of this model one can propose a plausible conjecture.
If the system has many initial causes of failure corresponding to various mechanisms
it seems reasonable to expect that the dispersion in their time constants will increase
along with their number. The infant mortality phase comes to an end when all initial
defects have emerged and have been eliminated either through a self-repairing pro-
cess or by elimination of the faulty items. Thus, one would expect the length of the
infant mortality phase to increase with the number and diversity of the defects, that
is to say basically with the “complexity” of the organism.
Note that in order to apply this argument to living organisms one must renormalize
the time scale with respect to size because, roughly speaking, the life span of living
organisms increases with their size.

We now turn to a class of models which relies on a global parameter, for instance the
birthweight of the organism or more generally any parameter of signiﬁcance for the
death rate.

Model based on the incidence of birthweight
In this subsection we will ask ourselves how a power law distribution might arise
from a Gaussian distribution due to a simple heterogeneity in an important physical

36

parameter.
In humans low birthweight is a crucial determinant of infant mortality. Here, how-
ever we are not interested in global infant mortality but in the age-speciﬁc pattern
of infant mortality. So far, in order to describe this pattern we have used the infant
mortality rate µb(t); here, however, we wish to describe it by a density probability
function. For instance the density function of the the life span T (seen as a random
variable) would be:

fT (t)dt =

Number of individuals who die in the age interval (t, t + dt)

Total number of individuals

The right-hand side is nothing else than µb(t)dt (except for a possible normalization
factor which is unimportant here); thus: fT (t) ∼ µb(t).
The next step is to establish a connection between the distribution of birthweights and
the distribution of life spans. For instance, one may say: “For a birthweight W in
the interval (1.5kg,1.6 kg) the life duration T will be about one week (on average),
whereas for a birthweight in the range (2.0kg,2.1kg) it will be 4 months”. More
generally, for the two random variables W and T one may posit a relationship of the
form: T = g(W ). Clearly, g(w) should be an increasing function, and in addition
one should have g(0) = 0. A possible example would be a parabolic relationship:
T = W 2.
Now, how can we get a power law density function for T ?
The distribution of W is known to be Gaussian13, which means it has the following
density function14:

fW (w) =

1

σ√2π

exph−(w − m)2/2σ2i

(B.1)

What will be the distribution of T ?
According to a well-known result, if the equation t = g(w) has only one solution
w1 = g−1(t) the density function of T = g(W ) will be (Papoulis 1965, p. 126):

fT (t) =

fW (w1(t))
g′ (w1(t))

(B.2)

where g′(w) denotes the derivative of g(w).
As an illustration, we consider the case: T = g(w) = wα. It leads to: g′(w) =
αwα−1 and w1(t) = t1/α. Clearly the power law behavior can only come from the
13Yet the tails are somewhat more heavy than would be expected from a standard Gaussian. That is why it was suggested
by some authors to represent it by a mixture of two Gaussian distributions: one for the central values and a second one,
much ﬂatter (that is to say with a large standard deviation), which would account for the tails.

14Of course, W takes only positive values which means that fW (w) should be zero for w ≤ 0.

denominator, not from the numerator. Thus, we must have:

37

(cid:16)t1/α(cid:17)α−1

∼ tγ

which leads to: α = 1/(1 − γ) that is to say γ = 1 − 1/α.
The resulting power law behavior is little affected by the function which stands at
the numerator provided that (w1 − m)/σ is not too large; otherwise the exponential
becomes so small that everything else is suppressed.
Fig. B1a,b shows the case α = 4, γ = 0.75. The graph on the left-hand side shows
the functions (“g” means “Gaussian” and “h” means “hyperbolic”)

fT (t) ∼ ygyh

yg = exph−(t1/4 − m)2i /(2σ2),

yh = 1/tγ

The graph on the right-hand side shows the results of a simulation with the same
parameters.
Remark Why has the transformation T = W 4 (the exponent 4 is just for the pur-
pose of illustration, the argument is the same for any exponent larger than 1) the
dramatic effect of making fT (t) diverge at t = 0? At ﬁrst sight, this transformation
seems fairly smooth. Yet, it has one dramatic feature: the derivative of the inverse
function g−1(t) = t1/4 diverges at t = 0. The reason why this leads to the divergence
of fT (t) is easy to explain intuitively.
• Firstly, the fact that the initial distribution is Gaussian is unimportant. For the
sake of simplicity we can as well assume that fW is a uniform distribution that is to
say has a rectangular density function.
• The probability assigned to the interval t ∈ I1 = (0.01, 0.101) will be the same
as the probability assigned to the interval w ∈ J1 = (cid:16)0.011/4, 0.11/4(cid:17) = (0.32, 0.56).
Similarly, the probability assigned to t ∈ I2 = (15.0, 15.1) will be given by the
probability of w ∈ J2 = (cid:16)15.01/4, 15.11/4(cid:17) = (1.968, 1.971). Thus, for I1, I2 of the
same length, J1 is 80 times larger than J2. As the distribution of W is supposed
uniform, we will have P{t ∈ I1} = 80P{t ∈ I2}.
The same argument is illustrated in the insert graph of Fig. B1 b. The intervals I1, I2
were selected for the sake of making the graph best readable: I1 = (0.2, 2.5), I2 =
(15.17.3). With these intervals J1 is 7.5 times larger than J2.
Incidentally, the requirement of the conservation of the probability mass that we

used above also quickly leads to the result (2). Indeed:

fT (t)dt = fW (w)dw ⇒ fT (t) = fW (w)

dw
dt

= fW (w)

dg−1

= fW (w1)

g′(w1)

Are such high exponents consistent with what is known about the relationship T =
g(W )? There are three answers to this question.

Life duration

Fig. B1a,b Density function of life duration: left: calculated from the theoretical expressions, right: gen-
erated through a random number simulation. The Gaussian distribution describing the weight distribution
has the parameters m = 2.5, σ = 1. The simulation relied on 10, 000 random drawings. The insert gives an
intuitive explanation of why the transformation T = W 4 leads to a density function fT which has a very high
probability in the vicinity of T = 0.

(1) So far we did not ﬁnd any data giving the function T = g(W ). In medical
statistics it is another variable which is commonly used namely the “birthweight
speciﬁc infant mortality” which means infant mortality as a function of birthweight.
In this expression, “infant mortality” has the standard medical meaning of “under
one year of age” rather than the broad meaning used in the present paper.

(2) As a function of birthweight, infant mortality increases sharply when W de-
creases. For W = 2.0 kg, the infant mortality is 20%, then W = 1.5 kg gives a
mortality of 40% and W = 1 kg of 80%. In a broad sense, such a rapid change is
consistent with exponents α that reach high values.

(3) At ﬁrst sight it might seem that in the present model we cannot get γ > 1.
This is not really true however as can be seen in Fig. B1a. It shows that the slope
of fT (t) = ygyh is strictly equal to γ only in the vicinity of the maximum of the
function yg. On the left-hand side of the maximum the slope will be smaller than γ
whereas on the right-hand side it will be higher than γ.

(4) In the previous argument we considered T as a function of birthweight but this
is only one possible case. T can be connected as well to other variables, for instance
to the effectiveness of the immune system at birth. The main reason for selecting the
birthweight was data availability. The effectiveness of the immune system may be a
“better” variable but, to our best knowledge, no data are available.

39

How can one generate a power law death rate by superposition?
The transition from a speciﬁc death rate (e.g. exponential or Gaussian) to a power
law death rate can be presented in a more general framework.
Let the death rate be conditional on a parameter a, that is to say: µ ≡ µ(t|a) and sup-
pose that the parameter a is determined by a distribution f (a). Under these assump-
tions the unconditional death rate resulting from the superposition of the processes
µ(t|a) is:

(B.3)

µ(t) = Z ∞

0

µ(t|a)f (a)da

The expression (B.3) is very general. It gives the mortality rate that results from the
superposition of a set of “elementary” processes with weights f (a).
As an illustration, let us consider the following case:

µ(t|a) = Ae−at,

f (a) = 


1

bΓ(d)


b!d−1
 a

ea/b

(B.4)

The function f (a) is the density function of a Chi-squared distribution with d degrees
of freedom. With this choice we obtain:

µ(t) =

A

(1 + bt)d

(B.5)

In order to connect this expression with observation we write it in log-log form by
deﬁning y = log µ and u = log t:

y = −d log(1 + beu) + log A

(B.6)
For large values of age15, typically t ≫ 1/b, one gets: y = −du + log(A/bd) which
leads to the identiﬁcation: d = γ.
For t ≪ 1/b, one gets: y = −dbeu + log A which shows a behavior similar to what
was observed for beetles (Fig. 11).
For this model it would be an important step forward to be able to identify the pa-
rameter a with a physical variable for this will provide a more direct contact with
observation.

15In the case of human mortality, “large” would mean a few years.

40

Comparison of the two classes of models
The adaptive mechanism on which the ﬁrst model relies establishes a connection be-
tween what we observe (i.e. the age-speciﬁc infant mortality) and what is going on
inside the system. This could give an insight and understanding of the phenomenon
of infant mortality. However, as already pointed out, because of its many free param-
eters the model has no predictive power. This obstacle may be overcome by doing
additional observations focused on simple subsystems.

Unlike the ﬁrst, the second kind of models does not relate what is observed to what
is happening inside. Yet, it has the merit of offering testable predictions. The suc-
cessive steps can be summarized as follows:

Measurement of γ → α → T = g(W ) → Comparison of g(W )to observation

If the predicted form of T = g(W ) agrees with observation, we will get more conﬁ-
dence in the model, yet we will not learn anything new. On the contrary, if the pre-
dicted form does not agree with observation, this will raise a question. If T = g(W )
displays a well deﬁned pattern but which differs from the predicted function, then
one must understand why.

Appendix C: Additional data about plant mortality

Is the high exponent found for palm trees also observed for other big trees? As
already said, there are few studies available which is why their discussion is made
in the present appendix rather than in the paper itself. One study that is cited in
Valen (1975), namely Hett and Loucks (1971), concerns a species of maple tree.
Although less high than Euterpa, it is also a big tree which can live up to 250 years.
Observations were conducted in Wisconsin for trees ranging from germination time
to the age of 16 years and they led to γ = 1.35 ± 0.16. This value shows that the γ
value of Euterpa may be exceptional16.
Before closing this subsection about plants a word of caution must be added to ob-
serve that the methodology used for trees relies on the assumption that the age struc-
ture of the population under observation is in a stationary state. Why? The reason
is simple. Valen’s observations cover an age interval of 150 years. Clearly such an
observation was not made by following a cohort of seedlings in the course of time.

16Although Valen cites the paper by Hett and Loucks, he does not discuss their results and why they are so different;
in fact, he does not even give their results. This is just a conﬁrmation of the fact that, unlike physics, life sciences and
social sciences develop a kind of “mosaic knowledge”. By this term we mean that basically these ﬁelds are made up of
a multitude of disconnected results. This can be illustrated by the title of a randomly selected paper: “The demography
of the short-lived perennial halophyte Spergularia maritima in a sea-shore meadow in south-western Sweden” by A.
Telenius, Journal of Ecology 81,1,61-73 (1993). The study concerns one species in one place, in one country without any
attempt to broaden it to other places or other species.

41

Instead Valen conducted a transversal study of the population. Although the study
by Hett and Loucks covers only 16 years of age, they used the same method. One
should keep in mind that, due to possible ﬂuctuations in the age structure, transversal
studies may not correctly reﬂect and describe the survivorship curve. In other words,
the values of γ need to be conﬁrmed by plant studies based on longitudinal analysis.

One study of this kind can be found in Silvertown and Dickie (1980). They followed
the growth of several perennial plants (that is to say plants which live several years)
after their germination over a period of one year. On average the authors made a
ﬁeld visit every 42 days. For several of their species, their initial cohort comprised
less than one hundred plants. We will limit ourselves to one species (namely An-
thyllis vulneraria, a plant about 30 cm high with green leaves and yellow ﬂowers)
whose initial cohort numbered over 300. The values of the infant mortality death
rates derived from the survivorship curve plotted in the paper lead to the following
exponent: γ = 3.4 ± 1.9. This high exponent suggests a high initial death rate and
the latter is quite consistent with the qualitative observations reported by the authors.
They tell us that “no individuals reached the ﬂowering stage in any of the popu-
lation under observation and most cohorts experienced over 80% mortality in their
ﬁrst year”. They add that such high levels of pre-reproductive mortality agree well
with the observations made by other researchers. In the particular case of Anthyllis
vulneraria, a study conducted in the Netherlands on 1,117 plants showed that only
27% ever reached the ﬂowering stage (Sterk 1975). Moreover, the author notes (p.
333) that “younger plants have a smaller survival chance owing to the high seedling
mortality”.

Observations in greenhouse under controlled conditions
The exponents γ observed so far were equal to 2.6, 1.3, 3.4 respectively which gives
an average of 2.43 that is to say two or three times higher than the exponents found
for animal species. As these were ﬁeld observations should these high values not be
attributed to the fact that in the ﬁeld the trees are exposed to various adverse condi-
tions? In other words can these observations be conﬁrmed by controlled observations
performed in greenhouses?

We will mention one observation of that kind. Lidia Cruz and her collaborators
(2014) report an experiment in which the seedlings of 6 cacti species were grown
in a greenhouse during a period of 16 months after germination. For the species E.
reichenbachii the exponent was γ = 2.6 and the average for the 6 species was 1.98.
This shows that high values of γ are not limited to ﬁeld observations of trees. How-
ever, not all trees have a γ higher than 1. An experiment for acacia trees performed
in India gave values of γ around 0.7 (Shaukat et al. 1999).

into Russian. It does not seem to have ever been translated into English. In
1935, it was re-edited by “Librairie F´elix Alcan”, Paris.
[This study was written in a time marked by the emergence of sociology as a
new ﬁeld. It is interesting to observe that at that time it seemed natural for the
author to discuss human and animal societies within the same conceptual frame-
work. Nevertheless, Alfred Espinas is quite aware of the fact that in order to be
meaningful such broad comparisons must focus on a small number of basic and
well selected features.
The author explains his epistemological positions in the following terms (p. 5),

followed by my translation:
“Nul ˆetre vivant n’est seul. La vie en commun n’est pas dans le r`egne animal
un fait accidentel. Elle n’est point, comme on le croit souvent, le privil`ege de
quelques esp`eces isol´ees dans l’´echelle zoologique, castors, abeilles et fourmis;
elle est au contraire un fait normal, constant, universel.
C’est une tentative aussi vaine que fr´equemment renouvel´ee que celle de d´ecou-
vrir les lois de la vie sociale dans l’homme ind´ependamment de toute compara-
ison avec les autres manifestations de la vie sociale dans le reste de la nature.
Mais il faut reconnaˆıtre qu’un simple rapprochement ne sufﬁt pas”.
No living organism is completely isolated. The act of living together is not lim-
ited to a small number of social species such as beavers, bees or ants. Quite
on the contrary it is a universal feature of animal life. It would be a vain and
worthless attempt to try to unravel the laws of social life independently of the
study of social behavior in animals. Yet, one must recognize that in order to be
fruitful such a comparison must be well focused.]

(P.M.) editor: Handbook of models for human aging, p. 45-67. Elsevier.
[The authors describe several mathematical structures which may play a role
in the process of aging, for instance systems working in series (i.e. fast global
failure) or in parallel (i.e. delayed global failure), systems beset with initial
damages, avalanche-like situations where new defects appear in proportion to
the number of defects already existing. Based on these effects (or their combi-
nation) it is possible to generate Gompertz’s law of aging in many ways. How-
ever, unless conﬁrmed by the observation the internal structure, such models
remain merely a mathematical game. Better than an avalanche of speculative
models largely based on thin air, modeling should be done hand in hand with
appropriate experiments One should not think that such a situation where sev-
eral theoretical frameworks are in competition is special to the life sciences.
It also occurs in physics. For instance, the solubility of gases in water can be
explained by several effects.

• Equality at equilibrium of the ﬂows in both directions. As the velocities are
known from the equipartition principle, it is possible to derive the concentrations.
• Number of molecules of water in the solvation shell, i.e. the shell surrounding
a molecule of gas (Sharlin et al. 1998)
• Concentration gradient in the ﬁlm at the interface between the gas and the liquid

44

(Lewis and Whitman 1924).
• Respective interaction strengths between molecules in the gas on the one hand
and in the liquid on the other hand. Obviously, if the molecules of the gas and of the
liquid have a strong attraction solubility will be higher.

Atlantic mackerels and African elephants; the mackerel female lays almost one
million eggs whereas the elephant female has only one offspring at a time.]
