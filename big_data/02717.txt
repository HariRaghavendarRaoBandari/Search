Abstract

A system of oscillators indexed by the two-dimensional integer lattice with nearest-
neighbour coupling is considered and shown to possess a rotating wave solution. This
work extends previous investigations on ﬁnite square lattices and demonstrates how
the system behaves as the size of the lattice goes to inﬁnity. The linearized stability of
the solution is investigated by providing a link with the underlying graph structure of
the nearest-neighbour connection topology. In particular it is shown that the stability
depends on the Banach space in which the perturbations are given in.

Introduction

Over the past few decades it has been shown that there are subtle, but measurable, dif-
ferences in dynamics between analytic solutions to partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs)
and to their discretized counterparts that arise from numerical integrations of the
model. For this reason, systems of ordinary diﬀerential equations that are formed by
the discretization of space in the original PDE have emerged as a notable area of re-
search. This then leads to the study of a system of diﬀerential equations which lie
in between partial diﬀerential equations and their numerical schemes, allowing one to
retain some of the discrete nature of the numerical scheme while still being able to

1

apply the techniques of continuous time dynamical systems. Systems of this type are
often referred to as Lattice Dynamical Systems (LDSs) and in addition to being a pro-
totype for numerical schemes, LDSs arise naturally in various physical settings such
as material science, in particular metallurgy, where LDSs have been used to model
solidiﬁcation of alloys [3, 5]. Other areas of research include chemical reactions [11],
optics [12] and biology; particularly with chains of coupled oscillators arising in models
of neural networks [7, 9]. With almost unlimited applications, LDSs have therefore
proven to be an interesting area of research without their PDE counterparts.

Rigorous inspection into traveling waves in one-dimensional LDSs (or chains) has
been undertaken by many researchers, most notably Zinner, who simpliﬁed the exis-
tence of traveling waves in such systems to a ﬁxed point problem [18]. Keener con-
tributed to the literature by investigating propagation failure in lattice systems with
a cubic nonlinearity [16] and it was deduced that monotone traveling wave solutions
can fail to propagate when the coupling between elements on the lattice is suﬃciently
weak. This was further extended to traveling waves on two-dimensional lattices by
Cahn, Mallet-Paret and Van Vleck in [4] where the authors now show that propaga-
tion failure is dependent not only on the strength of coupling between cells, but also
on the direction of propagation.

In this paper we continue the inspection of propagating solutions in LDSs, although
now turning to the existence of rotating wave solutions on two-dimensional lattices. To
achieve this result we study an inﬁnite system of oscillators, each coupled to its four
nearest-neighbours. These phase equations take the form

˙θi,j(t) = ω +Xi′,j ′

H(θi′,j ′(t) − θi,j(t)),

(1.1)

where ˙x = dx/dt and θi,j : R+ → S1 for each (i, j) ∈ Z2. Each oscillator is assumed to
be identical and therefore ω is taken to be a real-valued constant. The sum is taken over
the four nearest-neighbours of (i, j) in the two-dimensional square lattice: (i ± 1, j),
(i, j ± 1), and H : S1 → S1 is an inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable odd coupling function which
is assumed to be 2π-periodic and strictly increasing on the interval ( −π
2 ). We seek
solutions of the form θi,j(t) = ωt + ¯θi,j, where each oscillator has the same frequency
but diﬀers through the time-independent phase-lag ¯θi,j. Using any four cell ring in
the lattice as a core, a rotating wave solution of this system is deﬁned so that the
phase-lags over concentric rings around this core increase from 0 up to 2π.

Rotating wave solutions to diﬀerential equations are of great interest because of
their relevance to various applications, typically in models of complex biological and
chemical processes. For example, in the study of cardiac electrophysiology it has been
shown that spiral waves appear in models of the ventricular muscle and are often
precursors to severe or fatal arrhythmias [2, 13]. In a continuous spatial setting these
waves are time-periodic solutions of diﬀerential equations whose ﬂow in time is given

2

by an action of a rotational symmetry group. The study of rotating and spiral waves
is in no way complete and remains an active area of research throughout the physical
sciences. Here we will expand on the theory of rotating waves by moving into a spatially
discretized domain stemming from PDE models.

Systems of coupled oscillators of this form posed on ﬁnite square lattices were
studied by Ermentrout and Paullet in [10], where it is shown that rotating waves not
only exist but are stable. Their model arises from the method of averaging applied to
arrays of weakly coupled oscillators [8]. Here we extend the results given by Ermentrout
and Paullet by moving to an inﬁnite lattice and show that depending on the Banach
space in which the problem is posed on, we may still recover stability of the solution.
Moving to an inﬁnite lattice gives insight into what can be expected of the rotating
wave solution as the size of the lattice increases, as well as understand its dynamics in
the absence of boundary conditions.

The lattice structure and nearest-neighbour connections give system (1.1) a natural
underlying graph theoretic geometry which we exploit throughout this work. We will
begin by saying that nearest-neighbours are one step along the lattice from each other
and then extend this notion inductively so that we say an element is k steps away from
another element if the shortest path along the lattice via nearest-neighbour connections
requires us to move through exactly k lattice points. For example, the cells with
indices (1, 0) and (2, 2) are said to be 3 steps away from each other with an example
of a shortest path between these indices via nearest-neighbour connections given by
(1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (2, 2). Aside from this geometric perspective, this can be
quantiﬁed analytically by saying that two elements indexed by the lattice points (i1, j1)
and (i2, j2) are k steps away from each other if

|i1 − i2| + |j1 − j2| = k.

(1.2)

This notion of distance along the lattice structure has important implications for
our system. We see that the ﬁrst derivative of any oscillator depends on the value of
all nearest-neighbours as well as itself. Then the second derivative of any oscillator will
depend on the derivative of each of its nearest-neighbours and the derivative of itself,
implying that by the form of our LDS, we have the second derivative of any oscillator
depending on the values of all oscillators two steps or less from it. More generally, the
kth derivative of any oscillator depends on the value of all oscillators k steps or less
from it. This interconnectivity between oscillators will become crucial throughout this
work and provide the basis for much of the work carried out.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide a reduction to our model
from a system of coupled oscillators. Section 3 provides an overview of the results on
the ﬁnite lattice and in Section 4 we use these results to extend to a rotating wave
solution on the inﬁnite lattice. Section 5 gives a brief overview of some relevant graph-
theoretic notation and results which will be used to discuss the stability of the solution

3

over some inﬁnite-dimensional Banach spaces in Section 6.

2 Reduction to the Model

Let us consider the lattice dynamical system coupled via discrete diﬀusion given by

˙zi,j = αXi′,j ′

(zi′,j ′ − zi,j) + (1 + iω)zi,j − zi,j|zi,j|2,

(i, j) ∈ Z2

(2.1)

where the sum is again taken over all nearest-neighbours of the lattice point (i, j),

i = √−1 is the imaginary constant and zi,j : R+ → C. Here α > 0 is interpreted as

the coupling strength between neighbouring elements and ω is a non-zero real-valued
constant. In the absence of coupling (α = 0) each element is taken to be oscillating
with frequency 2π/ω and amplitude |zi,j| = 1. For each (i, j) let us write

where ri,j = ri,j(t) and θi,j = θi,j(t). Then the system (2.1) can now be written as

zi,j = ri,jei(Ωt+θi,j ),

(2.2)

˙ri,j = αXi′,j ′
˙θi,j = αXi′,j ′

(ri′,j ′ cos(θi′,j ′ − θi,j) − ri,j) + ri,j(1 − r2
ri′,j ′
ri,j

sin(θi′,j ′ − θi,j) + (ω − Ω),

(i, j) ∈ Z2.

i,j),

(2.3)

Without loss of generality we may assume that Ω = ω, thus cancelling the ﬁnal term
in each equation for ˙θi,j.

Searching for steady-state solutions of the polar variables reduces to solving

0 = αXi′,j ′
0 =Xi′,j ′

(ri′,j ′ cos(θi′,j ′ − θi,j) − ri,j) + ri,j(1 − r2
ri′,j ′
ri,j

sin(θi′,j ′ − θi,j),

i,j),

(2.4)

for each (i, j) ∈ Z2. Then as previously noted, letting α → 0+ we have ri,j → 1 for all
(i, j). This then reduces our problem to solving

0 =Xi′,j ′

sin(θi′,j ′ − θi,j),

(2.5)

for each (i, j), which correspond to the phase-lags of system (1.1).

In the interest of generality we will simultaneously explore other coupling functions
which retain some of the deﬁning characteristics of the sine function. This therefore
leads us to consider coupling functions H : S1 → S1 such that

4

• H ∈ C ∞(S1),
• H(x + 2π) = H(x) for all x ∈ S1,
• H(−x) = −H(x) for all x ∈ S1,
• H ′(x) > 0 for all x ∈ ( −π

2 , π

2 ).

We will see in the coming sections how this set of conditions is minimal in that each is
necessary for the results obtained in this work.

3 Rotating Waves on Finite Lattices

It was shown by Ermentrout and Paullet in [10] that there exists phase-locked rotating
waves solutions in ﬁnite square lattices. Here we will review this work and demonstrate
how it can be extended to give solutions on the inﬁnite lattice. We begin by ﬁxing an
integer N ≥ 2 and consider the truncated phase equations
H(θi′,j ′ − θi,j),

(3.1)

˙θi,j = ω +Xi′,j ′

where 1 − N ≤ i, j ≤ N , ω ∈ R and the sum is over the nearest-neighbours of the cell
(i, j) on the ﬁnite square integer lattice with side lengths 2N . Note that not all cells
have four neighbours in this case because of the truncation to a ﬁnite lattice. That is,
those cells along the edges have at most three nearest-neighbours included in the sum,
and if they are a corner then there will be only two nearest-neighbours in the sum.

We will follow the arguments laid out in [10] to show that there exists a phase-
locked solution to (3.1) of the form θi,j(t) = ωt + ¯θi,j. Such solutions all have the same
frequency and a ﬁxed phase lag ¯θi,j. We can further assume that ω = 0 with no loss of
generality by applying the transformation θi,j → θi,j + ωt to eliminate ω in (3.1) which
now reduces the search to steady-states corresponding to the phase lags. A rotating
wave solution in this framework is deﬁned such that for any ring about the centre of
the 2N × 2N array, the values of the phase lags increase from zero up to 2π. Hence,
we seek a steady-state solution with the symmetry shown in Figure 1. In this way,
we may reduce the number of equations from 4N 2 to 1
2 N (N − 1) by focusing on those
whose indices lie in the range 1 ≤ j < i ≤ N , which we refer to as the reduced system.
The reduced system is represented by the shaded cells in Figure 1.
Upon applying these reductions to the system we arrive at the problem of ﬁnding

a steady-state to the system of equations given by

˙θi,j =Xi′,j ′

H(θi′,j ′ − θi,j),

1 ≤ j < i ≤ N.

system.

with initial conditions θi,j(0) = π
4 . We also impose the boundary conditions θi,i = 0
and θi,0 = π
2 − θi,1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N which are reﬂected in Figure 1 for reference. These
boundary conditions lead to certain properties which are used to show the existence of
a steady-state solution. In particular, the cells directly below the diagonal (j = i − 1)
are connected to two diagonal elements (above and to the left) which reduces their
diﬀerential equations to

˙θi,i−1 = H(0 − θi,i−1) + H(0 − θi,i−1) + ···

= −2H(θi,i−1) + ··· .

(3.3)

Here we have used the odd symmetry of the coupling function and those terms left out
are the coupling terms to the right and below. Also, the cells in the ﬁrst row of the
reduced system (j = 1) have a special term due to their connection with the boundary
terms at j = 0 given by

˙θi,1 = H(cid:18) π
= H(cid:18) π

2 − θi,1 − θi,1(cid:19) + ···
2 − 2θi,1(cid:19) + ··· .

(3.4)

Remark. One will notice that there is a slight diﬀerence between the work in [10]
and of that which is given here, and that is the initial conditions. In the former, the

6

initial conditions are taken to be θi,j(0) = 0, whereas here we will note that they are
θi,j(0) = π
4 . This does not lead to any signiﬁcantly diﬀerent analysis, but does aﬀord
us a luxury in the coming work towards a solution on the inﬁnite lattice. Moreover,
it is conjectured that the solutions found by both of these initial conditions is exactly
the same, although this is beyond the scope of this work and therefore remains to be
shown.

The proof is broken down into two lemmas which together show that the trajectories
are decreasing and bounded below for all t > 0. These lemmas together show that the
trajectories therefore tend to an equilibrium as t → ∞. The proof will only be brieﬂy
summarized here as it is the nearly the same as that given by Ermentrout and Paullet,
with the only distinction being that of a sign change. Furthermore, an understanding of
the methods employed in the proof on the ﬁnite lattice leads to a greater understanding
of those used to extend to the inﬁnite lattice.

Lemma 3.1. Given θi,j(0) = π
0 < t < t0 and 1 ≤ j < i ≤ N .
Proof. Let us observe that with the initial conditions θi,j(0) = π
4

4 , there exists a t0 > 0 such that ˙θi,j(t) < 0 for all

˙θi,j(0) =Xi′,j ′

H(0) = 0,

for all j 6= i − 1 because H(0) = 0 by the odd symmetry of H.
j = i − 1 we get

˙θi,j(0) = −2H(cid:18) π

4(cid:19) + 2H(0) < 0.

(3.5)

In the case when

(3.6)

This implies that there is an interval to the right of zero in which every element directly
below the diagonal of the reduced system is decreasing.

An inductive argument will show that when j 6= i − 1 we have

and

= 0,

k = 1, . . . , i − j − 1

(3.7)

(3.8)

That is, the number of steps an element of the reduced system is from the diagonal
determines which derivative will be negative ﬁrst. Since the lattice is ﬁnite, this implies
that there exists a t0 > 0 such that ˙θi,j(t) < 0 for all 0 < t < t0 and 1 ≤ j < i ≤ N .
Lemma 3.2. For all t > 0 and 1 ≤ j < i ≤ N we have 0 < θi,j(t) < π

4 and ˙θi,j(t) < 0.

d(i−j)θi,j

Proof. This lemma is proved by assuming the contrary. That is, let ˆt > 0 be the ﬁrst
place where either θˆi,ˆj(ˆt) = 0 or ˙θˆi,ˆj(ˆt) = 0 for some index (ˆi, ˆj). Working with the ﬁrst
case we assume that θˆi,ˆj(ˆt) = 0 for some (ˆi, ˆj). Then we note that 0 ≤ θi,j(ˆt) < π
4 and
˙θi,j(ˆt) ≤ 0 for all i, j. Using the special form of those elements with j = 1 we see that
ˆj 6= 1 since

˙θˆi,1(ˆt) = H(cid:18) π

2(cid:19) + H(θˆi,2(ˆt)) + H(θˆi−1,1(ˆt)) +(cid:26) sin(θˆi+1,1(ˆt))

0

: i0 6= N
: i0 = N

,

(3.9)

which gives ˙θˆi,1(ˆt) > 0, contradicting our assumption.

Moving to a pair (ˆi, ˆj) with ˆj 6= 1 we see that if θˆi,ˆj(ˆt) = 0 we get

˙θˆi,ˆj(ˆt) =Xi′,j ′

H(θˆi′,ˆj ′(ˆt)).

(3.10)

Since all elements of the reduced system are nonnegative at t = ˆt we have that ˙θˆi,ˆj(ˆt) ≥
0. But from the deﬁnition of ˆt we know that ˙θˆi,ˆj(ˆt) ≤ 0, implying that ˙θˆi,ˆj(ˆt) = 0. The
only way in which this is possible is if elements indexed by nearest-neighbours of (ˆi, ˆj)
are such that θˆi′,ˆj ′(ˆt) = 0 as well. This allows us to move to the nearest-neighbour
(ˆi, ˆj − 1) and perform the same analysis to ﬁnd that ˙θˆi,ˆj−1(ˆt) ≥ 0. Again, the only way
in which this is possible is if all elements indexed by nearest-neighbours of (ˆi, ˆj − 1)
take the value 0 at t = ˆt. This process continues by systematically moving down one
cell at a time through the lattice until we ﬁnd that θˆi,2(ˆt) = 0. But then

˙θˆi,2(ˆt) = H(θˆi,1(ˆt)) + ··· ,

(3.11)

where the neglected terms are those elements to the left, above and to the right (if
ˆi 6= N ). As before, the neglected terms return a nonnegative value but one notices that
since we have already shown that θˆi,1(ˆt) > 0, it follows that ˙θˆi,2(ˆt) > 0, a contradiction.
Therefore, no θi,j(t) can reach 0 at t = ˆt.

Turning to the second case, we suppose ˙θˆi,ˆj(ˆt) = 0. Clearly we cannot have ˙θi,j(ˆt) =
0 for all i, j since this would mean that we have reached an equilibrium point in ﬁnite
time which is impossible. Therefore, it can be assumed that there exists some index
(i0, j0) such that ˙θi0,j0(ˆt) < 0 and again 0 ≤ θi,j(ˆt) < π
Let θi0,j0 be the closest indexed element to θˆi,ˆj with ˙θi0,j0(ˆt) < 0. Via a similar
induction argument to that which is used in Lemma 3.1 it can be shown that if the
index (i0, j0) is k steps away from the index (ˆi, ˆj) on the lattice then

4 and ˙θi,j(ˆt) ≤ 0 for all i, j.

But this implies that there exists a suﬃciently small interval to the left of ˆt such that
˙θˆi,ˆj > 0 on this
for all lower order derivatives we have dlθˆi,ˆj/dtl > 0. In particular,
interval, contradicting the minimality of ˆt and therefore is impossible. This concludes
the proof of the lemma since we have shown that no such ˆt can exist.

In summary, it was shown that each element of the reduced system is such that

0 < θi,j(t) <

4

and

˙θi,j(t) < 0

(3.14)

for all t > 0 and 1 ≤ j < i ≤ N . Hence, θi,j(t) is a decreasing function which is
bounded below, so
¯θi,j = lim
(3.15)
t→∞
4 ). Therefore {¯θi,j}1≤j<i≤N gives an equilibrium for
exists and lies in the interval [0, π
the reduced system. As a brief aside, one can further show via the same methods used
in Lemma 3.2 that ¯θi,j > 0 for all 1 ≤ j < i ≤ N .
To extend the solution of the reduced system we refer to Figure 2 where the ﬁnite
2N × 2N lattice has been partitioned into eight distinct regions. To begin, it has
already been remarked that those elements along the diagonal between regions I and

θi,j(t)

9

V III are ﬁxed at 0. Then those on the diagonal between regions II and III are ﬁxed
at π
2 , those between regions IV and V are ﬁxed at π and those between regions V I
2 . If we write ¯θ to be the solution of the reduced system found
and V II are ﬁxed at 3π
above, the solutions in each of the regions of Figure 2 are as follows:

I : ¯θ → ¯θ

Note that these extensions give exactly the symmetry of the solution shown in Figure

4 Rotating Waves on an Inﬁnite Lattice

We now extend the results of the ﬁnite lattice to that of an inﬁnite lattice. Consider
the inﬁnite system of phase equations

˙θi,j = ω +Xi′,j ′

H(θi′,j ′ − θi,j),

(4.1)

where (i, j) ∈ Z2 and as before ω ∈ R. We again seek rotating wave solutions to
such a system of diﬀerential equations of the form θi,j(t) = ωt + ¯θi,j, where ¯θi,j is a
time-independent phase-lag. We provide the following result.

Theorem 4.1. The system of diﬀerential equations (4.1) has a nontrivial phase-locked
rotating wave solution.

To achieve this result we prove a pair of lemmas which extend the results of Ermen-
trout and Paulette’s work on ﬁnite square lattices. We will work only on the reduced
system since it has already been shown that solutions here can be extended to solutions
over the entire ﬁnite lattice. As before, without loss of generality we can assume ω = 0
and we are therefore looking for equilibria of the phase system which correspond to

10

the phase lags of the rotating wave solution. Throughout this section when referring
to the solution of the ﬁnite lattice, this means that which was shown to exist herein
with the speciﬁc form given in Figure 1.
Lemma 4.2. Let N ≥ 2 and ﬁnite. If we denote ¯θi,j as the solutions on the ﬁnite
2N × 2N lattice in the reduced system, then ¯θi+1,j ≥ ¯θi,j for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i ≤ N − 1.
Proof. Recall that we take our initial conditions to be θi,j(0) = π
4 for all (i, j) in the
reduced system and those on the diagonal ﬁxed at 0. Then Lemma 3.1 details that
θi,i−1(0) < 0 and

Thus, for any (i, j) in the reduced system there exists an interval to the right of t = 0
such that θi,j(t) < θi+1,j(t) for all positive t in this interval. Since the reduced system
is ﬁnite, we ﬁnd that there must be an interval to the right of t = 0 for which this
holds for all (i, j).

Let us assume that this interval is ﬁnite. That is, let t0 > 0 be the ﬁrst value of t in
which the inequality no longer holds for all elements of the reduced system. Then there
exists at least one index of the reduced system, (i0, j0), such that θi0+1,j0(t0) = θi0,j0(t0),
and θi+1,j(t0) ≥ θi,j(t0) for all (i, j) 6= (i0, j0). We ﬁrst note that j0 6= i0. Indeed, by
Lemma 3.2 the elements of the reduced system satisfy 0 < θi,j(t) < π
4 for all t > 0 and
one sees that

θi0+1,i0(t) > 0 = θi0,i0(t).

(4.6)

Hence, along every row of the reduced system, there must be at least one strict in-
equality at t = t0. Therefore, without loss of generality, we may assume that the index
(i0, j0) is such that θi0+1,j0(t0) = θi0,j0(t0) > θi0−1,j0(t0).

Now let us investigate ˙θi0+1,j0(t0) − ˙θi0,j0(t0). Using the form for of the equations

given in (4.1) we see that

˙θi0+1,j0(t0) − ˙θi0,j0(t0) = H(θi0+1,j0+1(t0) − θi0,j0(t0)) − H(θi0,j0+1(t0) − θi0,j0(t0))

: i0 = N − 1
(4.7)
where θi0+1,j0(t0) has been replaced with θi0,j0(t0) by our assumption. Furthermore,
notice that the coupling between these cells vanishes since H(θi0+1,j0(t0)− θi0,j0(t0)) =
H(0) = 0. Figure 3 shows the location of these elements in relation to each other on
the lattice for visual reference. Since θi0+1,j0(t0) = θi0,j0(t0) > θi0−1,j0(t0) we see that

− H(θi0−1,j0(t0) − θi0,j0(t0)) > 0.

(4.8)

H(θi0+2,j0(t0) − θi0,j0(t0)) ≥ 0.

Moreover, in the case when i0 6= N−1 our assumption gives θi0+2,j0(t0) ≥ θi0+1,j0(t0) =
θi0,j0(t0) which implies
(4.9)
Again by the minimality of t0 we get that θi0+1,j0±1(t0) ≥ θi0,j0±1, leading to the fact
that
(4.10)
Putting this all together reveals that ˙θi0+1,j0(t0) − ˙θi0,j0(t0) > 0, which implies there
exists an interval to the left of t0 in which θi0+1,j0(t) < θi0,j0(t), which contradictions
the minimality of t0.

H(θi0+1,j0±1(t0) − θi0,j0(t0)) − H(θi0,j0±1(t0) − θi0,j0(t0)) ≥ 0.

Therefore, θi+1,j(t) > θi,j(t) for all t > 0. Allowing t → ∞ we see that the elements

of the equilibrium must satisfy ¯θi+1,j ≥ ¯θi,j for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i ≤ N − 1.

where there is an odd number of terms since the 2N × 2N lattice does not have a right

is nonnegative. This implies that at least one of the pair of diﬀerences in (4.11) must
be nonpositive. Recalling from Lemma 3.2 that the maximal diﬀerence between any
two elements of the reduced system is no greater than π/4 and that ¯θ(N )

We now apply a similar argument to the diﬀerence of the diﬀerential equations
( ˙θ(N +1)
η2 ) evaluated at the respective equilibrium for that size of
lattice. One can see that the equation for ( ˙θ(N +1)
−
¯θ(N +1)
), thus by the odd symmetry of the coupling function
η2
these terms eliminate themselves from the sum. Similarly, ( ˙θ(N )
η2 ) does not contain
the terms H(¯θ(N )
η1 ) since they will also cancel each other out
+ ˙θ(N +1)
in the sum. Then the diﬀerence ( ˙θ(N +1)
η2 ) again has the term
N +1,j0 − ¯θ(N +1)
H(¯θ(N +1)
) being nonnegative. Following an argument nearly identical to that
above, we ﬁnd that there exists an index, η3, which is a nearest-neighbour of either η1 or
η2 such that ¯θ(N )
. Moreover, η3 is distinct from η1 and η2 since the coupling
between these cells is not present in the equation ( ˙θ(N +1)
η2 ).
Furthermore, the choice of η3 is restricted to those indices (i, j) of the reduced system
such that neither j = 0 nor i = j, by the previous discussion.

of the element indexed by η1 is always considered in this sum we will always have a
nonnegative term in H(¯θ(N +1)
), allowing us to determine that there is a
nearest-neighbour, ηm+1, of one of the ηk such that ¯θ(N )
ηm+1 , via the same
process outlined for m = 1, 2. As before, the sum will eliminate any coupling present
between neighbouring indices, meaning that at each step the cardinality of the set of
indices {ηk}m
k=1 increases by one, and it can never be the case that ηm+1 = (i, j) is
such that j = 0 or i = j. In this way we are restricted in our choices to those which
are contained within the reduced system. This process is illustrated in Figure 4.

which we have already shown to be impossible. With this in mind we can proceed as
above by subtracting the diﬀerential equations at the index (N − 1, j0) for each lattice
size evaluated at their respective equilibria. The diﬀerence is that now we have an
even number of terms in the equation, but we have just shown that the diﬀerence of
right coupling terms evaluated at the equilibrium leads to a nonnegative interaction,

15

thus acting as the single nonnegative term in the diﬀerence when i0 = N . Proceeding
as above we can ﬁnd a nearest-neighbour of (N − 1, j0) to which the element at that
index for the 2N × 2N lattice is greater than the element at that index for the 2(N +
1)× 2(N + 1) lattice. This leads to the same chain of steps as in the case when i0 = N ,
where we now ﬁnd that the indices which give the desired conditions are limited to
not only those in the reduced system, but to those not in the N th column. Again
this procedure terminates in a ﬁnite number of steps, and the contradiction comes in
exactly the same way as the previous case.

We may continue this method by systematically decreasing i0 by one each step
along the way to see that there is no such column in the reduced system which can
contain an element that satisﬁes ¯θ(N )
. This then completes the proof of the
lemma since there is only a ﬁnite number of columns to check.

i,j > ¯θ(N +1)

i,j

This leads to the proof of Theorem 4.1.

Proof of Theorem 4.1. Lemma 4.3 shows that by observing the value of the equilib-
rium solution for each lattice size at a single index in the reduced system we form an
increasing sequence. By taking any N ≥ 2 we can identify the equilibrium solution
inside the reduced system of the 2N × 2N lattice as an element of the reduced system
in the inﬁnite lattice by appending the elements

¯θ(N )
i,j = 0

(4.16)

for all i > N and 1 ≤ j < i. We have now created a sequence of elements in the
reduced system of the inﬁnite lattice which is pointwise increasing and each element is
bounded above by π/4, therefore this sequence converges as N → ∞.

Let us write

¯θi,j := lim
N→∞

¯θ(N )
i,j ,

1 ≤ j < i.

(4.17)

By the continuity of the diﬀerential equations at each index of the reduced system we
see that these elements are themselves an equilibrium of the reduced system of the
inﬁnite lattice and that ¯θi,j ∈ (0, π
4 ] for all 1 ≤ j < i. Moreover, we can apply the
symmetries of the ﬁnite lattices shown in Figure 2 to extend this equilibrium in the
reduced system to an equilibrium of the entire two-dimensional lattice via the same
extensions outlined by Ermentrout and Paullet in (3.16). Then writing this equilibrium
extended to the entire inﬁnite lattice Z2 as ¯θ = {¯θi,j}i,j, the phase locked solution to
the phase equation (4.1) is given by

θi,j(t) = ωt + ¯θi,j

(4.18)

for all (i, j) ∈ Z2.

16

Remark. It was noted previously that a rotating wave solution on the lattice is such
that the phase-lags over any concentric ring about the centre four rings increase from
0 up to 2π. Although not explicitly stated in our result, this is indeed the case. We
state the following lemma without proof.
Lemma 4.4. Let N ≥ 2 and ﬁnite. If we denote ¯θi,j as the solutions on the ﬁnite
2N × 2N lattice in the reduced system, then ¯θi,j ≥ ¯θi,j+1 for all 1 ≤ j < i ≤ N .

The proof of Lemma 4.4 is carried out in an almost identical process to that of
Lemma 4.2 and is therefore omitted from this work. Letting N → ∞ we see that the
inequalities along both the rows and columns given by Lemmas 4.2 and 4.4, respectively,
remain true and once the extensions from the reduced system to the whole lattice are
applied we obtain a true rotating wave solution.

Having now shown the existence of phase-locked rotating wave solutions to system
(4.1) we turn our attention to determining its stability. It was shown that each solution
on the ﬁnite lattices is asymptotically stable and we wish to extend this result to the
case of the inﬁnite lattice. Before doing so we require some basic notions from graph
theory to properly frame the problem.

5 Graph Theoretic Framework

We consider a graph G = (V, E) with an at most countable collection of vertices, V ,
and a set of edges between these vertices, E, with the property that at most one edge
can connect two vertices and no edge can originate and terminate on the same vertex.
If there exists an edge e ∈ E connecting the two vertices x, y ∈ V then we write x ∼ y,
and because all edges will taken as undirected this relation is symmetric in that y ∼ x
as well. A graph is called connected if for any two vertices x, y ∈ V there exists a ﬁnite
sequence of vertices in V , {x1, x2, . . . , xn}, such that x ∼ x1, x1 ∼ x2, . . . , xn ∼ y.
We consider the notion of an operator on the graph by considering a potential
function P : V → R along with a weight function w : V × V → [0,∞) with the
property that w(x, y) = w(y, x) and w(x, y) > 0 if and only if x ∼ y. Then for any
function f : V → C acting on the vertices of G we deﬁne the discrete elliptic (linear)
operator L acting on these functions by

Lf (x) = P (x)f (x) +Xx∼y

w(x, y)(f (x) − f (y)).

(5.1)

We will often write L = P + A, where A denotes the sum in the formula above. The
operator A is typically referred to as a graph Laplacian and one should notice that A
maps constant functions to 0. Moreover, since G is a connected graph, Af = 0 if and
only if f is a constant function.

17

Each discrete elliptic operator naturally deﬁnes a quadratic form by

Q(f ) := Xx∈V

Lf (x) · f (x) = P (x)|f (x)|2 +

1

2 Xx∈V Xx∼y

w(x, y)|f (x) − f (y)|2.

(5.2)

To justify this notice that w(x, y) contributes to the sum twice by the symmetry of the
weight function. Then this gives

w(x, y)(f (x) − f (y))f (x) + w(y, x)(f (y) − f (x))f (y) =w(x, y)(f (x) − f (y))(f (x) − f (y))

=w(x, y)|f (x) − f (y)|2.

(5.3)
Furthermore, the factor of one half in front of the sum comes from the fact that
everything is being summed twice, again by the symmetry of the weight function.

Since V is at most countable, we turn our interest to the alternate form of the

sequence spaces ℓp(V ) given by

ℓp(V ) = {f : V → C | Xx∈V

|f (x)|p < ∞},

(5.4)

for any p ∈ [1,∞) and ℓ∞(V ) the space of all bounded functions on V . One often
writes the elements of the sequence spaces in the alternative form f = {fx}x∈V , where
fx := f (x). Our primary interest lies in the case when p = 2, the Hilbert Space ℓ2(V )
equipped with the natural inner product

hf, gi = Xx∈V

f (x) · g(x).

(5.5)

Using the symmetry of the weight function one can see that L is a symmetric
operator and in the cases it is everywhere deﬁned, it is self-adjoint. Furthermore, one
will notice that having now restricted ourselves to Hilbert space the quadratic form
(5.2) is given by

(5.6)
One should also note that A is a positive operator since hAf, fi ≥ 0 for any f ∈ ℓ2(V ).
Let us denote µ0(L) to be the minimum value of the spectrum of L. Recall that this
is given by

Q(f ) = hLf, fi.

µ0(L) = inf

f ∈ℓ2(V )hLf, fi.

(5.7)

We deﬁne a ground state to be a real-valued function φ on the vertices such that
φ(x) > 0 for all x ∈ V and

Lφ = µ0(L)φ.

(5.8)

It should be noted that even if φ exists it does not necessarily lie in ℓ2(V ). For a
discussion of problems of this type in the continuous setting see, for example, Pinksy

18

[17]. This now leads to the following result from Dodziuk [6] which will be used to
demonstrate the stability of the rotating wave solution found in the previous section.

Theorem 5.1 ([6], §2, Theorem 2.1). Consider a discrete elliptic operator L = P + A
on a connected graph G = (V, E) where A is positive and symmetric and there exists a
constant c ∈ R such that P (x) ≥ c for all x ∈ V . There exists a ground state φ for L
i.e. a function φ > 0 on V such that

Lφ = µ0(L)φ

(5.9)

where µ0(L) is the minimum of the spectrum of L.

6 Stability Results

We now turn to our discussion back to the rotating wave solution found in Theorem 4.1.
We again assume that ω = 0 and focus on the phase-lags, since the stability of a solution
with any ω ∈ R will be the same. Moreover, one sees that if {¯θi,j}(i,j)∈Z2 is a solution
then so is {¯θi,j + C}(i,j)∈Z2 for any constant C ∈ R since the system of diﬀerential
equations is only dependent on the diﬀerence between neighbouring elements. To work
around this we can take any index, say (i0, j0), and ﬁx the element at that index. Then
applying the transformation ¯θi,j → ¯θi,j − ¯θi0,j0 for all (i, j) will remove the translational
invariance of the solution and pose the problem on the inﬁnite lattice Λ := Z2\{(i0, j0)}.
The linearization of (4.1) about the phase-lags, which we denote L, allows us to
decompose this operator into the sum of two distinct operators acting an yet to be
speciﬁed sequence space with elements indexed by Λ. That is, for x = {xi,j}(i,j)∈Λ we
write L = P + A where

and

Hence, one sees that −L is a discrete elliptic operator over a graph whose vertices lie
in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of Λ. In this case the weight function
w : Λ × Λ → [0,∞) is given by
w((i, j), (k, l)) =(cid:26) H ′(¯θk,l − ¯θi,j)
This is indeed well-deﬁned, since all local interactions are such that |¯θi′,j ′ − ¯θi,j| ≤ π
2 .
More precisely, with the exception of the ’centre’ four cells at (i, j) = (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)

all local interactions are such that |¯θi′,j ′ − ¯θi,j| < π
2 , whereas the coupling between any
two of the four centre cells is exactly π/2. In this way we see that the weight function
(6.3) is both symmetric and only returns nonnegative values. Hence, we consider the
connected graph with vertex set that lies in one-to-one correspondence with the ele-
ments of Λ and an edge set which at least contains all nearest-neighbour connections
less those connections between any two of the centre four cells. In order for the edge set
to contain all nearest-neighbour interactions we require H ′(± π
2 ) 6= 0, although it is not
necessary to our work since the graph remains connected in either situation. Another
consequence of the local interactions satisfying |¯θi′,j ′ − ¯θi,j| ≤ π
2 is that the operator P
is a nontrivial diagonal operator with at most four nontrivial coeﬃcients.
Proposition 6.1. L : ℓ2(Λ) → ℓ2(Λ) has a bounded inverse.
Proof. As an operator on ℓ2(Λ) it can be shown that L is a bounded, self-adjoint,
negative operator whose spectrum lies in the interval (−∞, 0]. The fact that L is
bounded follows from L being a bounded operator on both ℓ1(Λ) and ℓ∞(Λ) (See
Theorems 2.40 and 2.41 of [1]).

Let us now assume that 0 belongs to the spectrum of L. Since −L is a discrete
elliptic operator (with −P ≥ 0) and its spectrum lies in one-to-one correspondence
with that of L, Theorem 5.1 implies that there exists an element φ = {φi,j}(i,j)∈Λ such
that φi,j > 0 and −Lφ = 0. Again, we note that φ does not necessarily belong to
ℓ2(Λ), but using the deﬁnition of the quadratic form (5.2) associated with −L we get
(6.4)

Q(φ) =XΛ

−Lφi,j · φi,j =XΛ

0 · φi,j = 0.

Since P has all nonpositive entries, it follows that the only way to have Q(φ) = 0 is
when Aφ = 0 and P φ = 0. Since our graph is connected (because all but at most four
nearest-neighbour connections are present), we see that the only way to have Aφ = 0
is when φ is a constant function on the vertices. Furthermore, since P is a nontrivial,
diagonal operator it follows that in order to have P φ = 0 at least one φi,j must be
zero. Thus, φ = 0, a contradiction.

Hence, we see that using the underlying graph structure gives that the rotating
wave solution is stable with respect to perturbations in ℓ2(Λ). This approach directly
parallels that which is undertaken by Ermentrout in [7] where a general theorem on
the stability of solutions to ﬁnite coupled networks is given. It is apparent that the
underlying graph structure of coupled networks, be it ﬁnite or inﬁnite, is crucial for
both understanding how solutions can be found and their stability. An important
distinction that is unique to having an inﬁnite number of oscillators is that stability
is dependent on the underlying space in which the problem is posed on. To illustrate
this fact the following proposition is presented.

Figure 5: A visualization of two vectors from the sequence {x(n)}∞
we have n = 4, 5 centred at the deleted index (i0, j0).

n=1 from the proof of Proposition 6.2. Here

Proposition 6.2. L : ℓ∞(Λ) → ℓ∞(Λ) does not have a bounded inverse.
Proof. We recall that the norm on ℓ∞(Λ) is given by

||x||∞ = sup

Λ |xi,j| < ∞.

(6.5)

Then to show that L does not have a bounded inverse, we show that it is not bounded
below. That is, we show that there does not exists a δ > 0 such that ||Lx||∞ ≥ δ||x||∞
for all x ∈ ℓ∞(Λ). We do this by constructing a sequence {x(n)}∞
n=1 ⊂ ℓ∞(Λ) such that
||x(n)||∞ = 1 for all n ≥ 1 but ||Lx(n)||∞ → 0 as n → ∞.
The sequence of vectors is constructed in the following way: Begin by ﬁxing n ≥ 1.
For those indices which are one step along the integer lattice Z2 (nearest-neighbours)
to (i0, j0) we set the elements of the vector with these indices to 1/n. Then we set the
eight elements which are two steps from the index (i0, j0) (nearest-neighbours of the
nearest-neighbours) to 2/n. Next we set the twelve elements which are three steps from
the index (i0, j0) to 3/n. We continue this pattern so that for any k ≤ n we set those
elements which are exactly k steps from the index (i0, j0) to k/n. For the remaining
elements of whose indices lie at more than n steps from the index (i0, j0) we set to 1.
Two vectors of this form are shown in Figure 5 for n = 4, 5 to visualize the form and
demonstrate how the vectors change as n increases.

Then clearly for each n this vector has norm 1 in ℓ∞(Λ), but one should notice that
the modulus of the diﬀerence between elements which are indexed by neighbouring

21

points on the lattice is always bounded above by 1/n. Furthermore,

(P x(n))i,j =( −H ′(¯θi,j )

n
0

: (i, j) = (i0 ± 1, j0), (i0, j0 ± 1)

(6.6)

which approaches the zero operator as n → ∞. Similarly,

|(Ax(n))i,j| ≤ X(i′,j ′)∩Λ

H ′(¯θi′,j ′ − ¯θi,j)|x(n)

i′,j ′ − x(n)

i,j | ≤

z∈[ −π
2 , π

H ′(z)

(6.7)

for all (i, j) ∈ Λ. Therefore ||Lx(n)||∞ → 0 as n → ∞, showing that L is not bounded
below and completing the proof.

The results of Proposition 6.2 show that vectors with suﬃciently large norm can be
mapped to vectors with suﬃciently small norms since the linearization L only takes into
account the diﬀerence between nearest-neighbours. It is for this reason that possibly
the classical sequence spaces are not necessarily the appropriate setting for problems
of this type. That is, perturbations in ℓ2(Λ) leave oscillators far from the centre of
rotation relatively unchanged and therefore cannot account for the typical problems
asked when considering systems of this type, particularly what the eﬀect of breaking
the odd symmetry of H is. Due to the underlying graph structure and how it eﬀects
the operator L it seems that a more appropriate spatial setting would be the sequence
spaces of bounded variation or the so-called Energy spaces of Jorgensen and cowork-
ers [14, 15]. The questions of spatial setting primarily remains one that is problem
dependent, much like the analogous work in spatially continuous PDEs.
