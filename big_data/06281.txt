Abstract

2016.03.20.AR

A virus dynamics model with intracellular state-dependent delay and nonlinear infection

rate of Beddington–DeAngelis functional response is studied. The technique of Lyapunov

functionals is used to analyze stability of an interior infection equilibrium which describes the

case of both CTL and antibody immune responses activated. We consider ﬁrst a particu-

lar biologically motivated class of discrete state-dependent delays. Next, the general case is

investigated.

Keywords:

evolution equations, Lyapunov stability, state-dependent delay, virus infection

model.

1 Introduction

We are interested in mathematical models of infectious diseases. The diseases are caused by

pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi. According to World

Health Organization, many viruses (as Ebola virus, Zika virus, HIV, HBV, HCV and others)

continue to be a major global public health issues.

In our research we concentrate on models of viral infections. There are variety of models with

and without delays which describe dynamics between diﬀerent viral infections and immune re-

sponses. Delays could be concentrated or distributed. We will not describe the historical evolution

of such models, just mention that early models [13, 12] contain three variables: susceptible host

cells, infected cells and free virus. Next step was to take into account, as written in [25], that "one

1

particular part of the immune system that is very important in the ﬁght against viral infections are

the killer T cells or cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)." See also [29] and references therein. There

is another adaptive immune response by antibodies. The relative balance of both types of immune

response "can be a decisive factor that determines whether patients are asymptomatic or whether

pathology is observe" [24]. These lead to introduction of two additional variables of both immune

responses [24, 25] (see also [27] and references therein).

The model under consideration contains ﬁve variables: susceptible (noninfected) host cells T ,

infected cells T ∗, free virus V , a CTL response Y , and an antibody response A. In case of bilinear

nonlinearities and one constant concentrated delay (see, for example, [26]) it has the following form

˙T (t) = λ − dT (t) − kT (t)V (t),
˙T ∗(t) = e−ωhkT (t − h)V (t − h) − δT ∗(t) − pY (t)T ∗(t),
˙V (t) = N δT ∗(t) − cV (t) − qA(t)V (t),
˙Y (t) = βT ∗(t)Y (t) − γY (t)
˙A(t) = gA(t)V (t) − bA(t).

Here the dot over a function denotes the time derivative i.g,

˙T (t) = dT (t)
dt

, all the constants

λ, d, k, δ, p, N, c, q, β, γ, g, b, ω are positive. As for the immune responses, the fourth equation de-

scribes the regulation of CTL response with pY (t)T ∗(t) (in the second equation) being the rate of

killing of infected cells by lytic immune response. The ﬁfth equation describes the regulation of

antibody response with qA(t)V (t) (in the third equation) being the rate of virus neutralization by

antibodies [24, p.1744]. In (1), h denotes the delay between the time the virus contacts a target

cell and the time the cell becomes actively infected (starts to produce new virions).

In the above model, the standard bilinear incidence rate is used according to the principle

of mass action. For more details and references on the models of infectious diseases with more

general types of nonlinear incidence rates see e.g.

[9, 5].

In paper [28], following [8, 22, 26],

authors assume that the infection rate of the virus dynamics models is given by the Beddington-

DeAngelis functional response [1, 2],

1+k1T +k2V , where k, k1, k2 ≥ 0 are constants. The Lyapunov
asymptotic stability[11] of points of equilibrium is studied for the following model with constant

kT V

concentrated delay

˙T (t) = λ − dT (t) − f (T (t), V (t)),
˙T ∗(t) = e−ωhf (T (t − h), V (t − h)) − δT ∗(t) − pY (t)T ∗(t),
˙V (t) = N δT ∗(t) − cV (t) − qA(t)V (t),
˙Y (t) = βT ∗(t)Y (t) − γY (t)
˙A(t) = gA(t)V (t) − bA(t).

The functional response

f (T, V ) =

was introduced by Beddington [1] and DeAngelis et al. [2].

It is evident that the constancy of the delay is an extra assumption which essentially simpliﬁes

the analysis, but is not motivated by the biological background of the model. It was a reason (see

e.g. [23]) to discuss distributed delay models as an alternative to discrete constant delay ones. We

propose another approach.

Our goal is to remove the restriction of the constancy of the delay and investigate the well-

posedness and Lyapunov stability of the following virus infection model with Beddington-DeAngelis

functional response and state dependent delay. It appears that the analysis essentially diﬀers from

the constant delay case. To the best of our knowledge, such models have not been considered

before. It is well known that diﬀerential equations with state dependent delay are always nonlinear

by its nature (see the review [7] for more details and discussion).

As usual in a delay system with (maximal) delay h > 0 [6, 10, 3], for a function v(t), t ∈ [a, b] ⊂

R, a > b + h, we denote the history segment vt = vt(θ) ≡ v(t + θ), θ ∈ [−h, 0]. We denote the
space of continuous functions by C ≡ C([−h, 0]; R5) equipped with the sup-norm. In the above

notations, we use u(t) = (T (t), T ∗(t), V (t), Y (t), A(t)) and consider a continuous functional (state

dependent delay) η : C → [0, h]. Now we can present the system under consideration

˙T (t) = λ − dT (t) − f (T (t), V (t)),
˙T ∗(t) = e−ωhf (T (t − η(ut)), V (t − η(ut))) − δT ∗(t) − pY (t)T ∗(t),
˙V (t) = N δT ∗(t) − cV (t) − qA(t)V (t),
˙Y (t) = βT ∗(t)Y (t) − γY (t)
˙A(t) = gA(t)V (t) − bA(t).

with the functional response f (T, V ) given by (3). We denote by F the right-hand side of (4) to

write the system shortly as ˙u(t) = F (ut).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss and choose diﬀerent sets of initial

data and prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions. Next we prove that the sets are invariant.

Section 3 is devoted to the stability properties of a stationary solution. We study the stability of

an interior equilibrium which describes the case when both CTL and antibody immune responses

are activated. We believe this infection equilibrium is only biologically meaningful in the study

of the disease. We use the technique of Lyapunov functionals [11] and consider ﬁrst a particular

(biologically motivated) case of state-dependent delay. We complete the paper by investigation of

the general case.

2 Preliminaries

We ﬁrst study the basic questions of the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the problem (4).

Since two functions T and V are used in (4) at diﬀerent time moments (current time t and delayed

time t − η(ut)), we should consider initial values T (θ), V (θ) for θ ∈ [−h, 0]. As usual for such a

biological system, one should check the non-negativeness and boundedness of all the coordinates

provided initial values are non-negative.

3

We will study the system (4) with an initial function

u0 = ϕ ≡ (T0, T ∗

0 , V0, A0, Y0) ∈ C+ ≡ C+[−h, 0],

(5)

where R+ ≡ [0, +∞), C+ ≡ C+[−h, 0] ≡ C([−h, 0]; R5

+).

Let us introduce the set

ΩC ≡ {ϕ ≡ (T0, T ∗

0 , V0, A0, Y0) ∈ C+[−h, 0],

0 ≤ T0(θ) ≤

(6)

We consider the following assumption on the state-dependent delay

(H1η) ∀ψ ∈ Z 2,3 ≡(cid:8)ψ = (ψ1, ψ2, ψ3, ψ4, ψ5) ∈ C+ : ψ2(0) = ψ3(0) = 0(cid:9) =⇒ η(ψ) > 0.

(7)

Remark 1. We notice that even more restrictive assumption η(ψ) > 0 for all ψ ∈ C+ is

biologically well motivated. On the other hand, even this restriction (the so-called "non-vanishing

delay") does not guarantee the uniqueness of solutions with merely continuous data (see [4]).

The ﬁrst result is the following

Theorem 2. Let η : C → [0, h] be a continuous functional (state dependent delay). Then

(i) for any initial function ϕ ∈ C there exist continuous solutions to (4), (5).

(ii) If additionally, η satisﬁes (H1η), then for any initial function ϕ ≡ (T0, T ∗

0 , V0, A0, Y0) ∈ ΩC
such that T0, V0 are Lipschitz functions, the problem (4), (5) has a unique solution. The solution

is globally Lipschitz in time and satisﬁes

ut ≡ (Tt, T ∗

t , Vt, At, Yt) ∈ ΩC ,

t ≥ 0.

Proof of Theorem 2. (i) The existence of continuous solutions is guaranteed by the continuity

of the right-hand side of (4) and classical results on delay equations [6, 3].

(ii) Since T0, V0 are Lipschitz functions, the uniqueness of continuous solutions follows from the

general results on diﬀerential equations with state-dependent delay (see the review on ordinary

equations [7] for details and references and also [14, 15, 16, 18] for PDEs)). Let us show that the

set ΩC is invariant i.e. any solution starting from ϕ ∈ ΩC remains in ΩC for all t ≥ 0.

We notice that in the case of constant delay the non-negativeness of all coordinates of a solution

follows from the quasi-positivity property of the right-hand side of (4) (see e.g. [19, Theorem 2.1,

p.81]). We stress that in the case of state-dependent delay we cannot directly apply [19, Theorem

2.1, p.81] because it relies on the Lipschitz property of the right-hand side of a system, which is

not the case for (4). We could use the corresponding extension to the state-dependent delay case

[17], but we propose another way here.

4

To prove the non-negativeness of all coordinates of a solution u(t) = (T (t), T ∗(t), V (t), Y (t), A(t))
we use the direct analysis of each coordinate. It is easy to see that T (t) → 0+ implies ˙T (t) → λ > 0

which makes impossible for T to become negative. The direct integration shows that coordinates

satisfy

T ∗(t) = T ∗(0)e−R t

f (T (τ − η(uτ )), V (τ − η(uτ )))e− R t

τ (c+qA(s)) ds dτ,

A(t) = A(0) e− R t

0 (gV (τ )−b)) dτ .

(8)

(9)

(10)

Equations (10) show that Y (0) ≥ 0, A(0) ≥ 0 implies Y (t) ≥ 0, A(t) ≥ 0 for all t ≥ 0. For the

constant delay case, equations (8), (9) would imply the similar result for T ∗(t), V (t), but for the
state-dependent delay we need more care. First, (8) shows the property (for some t1 ≥ 0)

V (s) ≥ 0, s ∈ [−h, t1]

implies

T ∗(s) ≥ 0, s ∈ [0, t1].

Similarly, (9) gives

T ∗(s) ≥ 0, s ∈ [0, t1]

implies

V (s) ≥ 0, s ∈ [0, t1].

(11)

(12)

Now, let us assume that the non-negativity of T ∗ or V falls. Properties (11), (12) show that T ∗

and V should change the sign simultaneously i.e. there exist a (smallest possible) time moment
t1 ≥ 0 and δ1 > 0 such that T ∗(t) ≥ 0, V (t) ≥ 0 for t ∈ (t1 − δ1, t1] and T ∗(t) < 0, V (t) < 0 for
t ∈ (t1, t1 + δ1). By the continuity of solutions, T ∗(t1) = V (t1) = 0 which implies (see (H1η)) that
ut1 ∈ Z 2,3 i.e. η(ut1 ) > 0. Hence there exists δ2 > 0 such that V (τ −η(uτ )) ≥ 0 for τ ∈ (t1, t1 +δ2).
By this property and (8), one has T ∗(t) ≥ 0 for t ∈ (t1, t1 + δ2). It contradicts the choice of t1 and

completes the proof of the non-negativity of all coordinates.

Let us prove the upper bounds on the coordinates, given in (6). To save the space we formulate

an easy variant of the Gronwall’s lemma.

Lemma 3. Let ℓ ∈ C1[a, b) and satisfy d

dt ℓ(t) ≤ c1 − c2ℓ(t), t ∈ [a, b). Then ℓ(a) ≤ c1c−1
for all t ∈ [a, b). In the case b = +∞, for any ε > 0 there exists tε ≥ a such

2

implies ℓ(t) ≤ c1c−1
2
that ℓ(t) ≤ c1c−1

2 + ε for all t ≥ tε.

Proof of Lemma 3 is easy multiplication of the inequality by ec2t and integration over [a, t]. It

leads to ℓ(t) ≤(cid:16)ℓ(a) − c1

c2(cid:17) e−c2(t−a) + c1

. It completes the proof of Lemma 3. (cid:3)

Since f is non-negative for non-negative arguments (see (3)), we get from the ﬁrst equation of

(4) the estimate ˙T (t) ≤ λ − dT (t). Hence Lemma 3 and T (0) ≤ λ
use it to estimate the second coordinate, see (3), as follows f (T, V ) ≤ kλV

Lemma 3 implies the last estimate in (6). All solutions are global (deﬁned for all t ≥ −h). It

completes the proof of Theorem 2. (cid:3)

Remark 4. We notice the our invariant set ΩC diﬀers from the absorbing set Γ, used in [28]

for the constant delay system. Let us denote by Ωε

increased by ε. Then the second part of the Lemma 3 implies that for any ε > 0 the set Ωε

C the set where all the upper bounds in (6) are
C is
absorbing for any solution (not necessary starting in ΩC ). Another diﬀerence is that all the ﬁve

coordinates of ϕ ∈ ΩC are continuous functions in contrast to the constant delay case [28], where

the second, fourth and ﬁfth coordinates belong to R+.

Remark 5.

It is well known that continuous solutions to diﬀerential equations with state-

dependent delay may be non-unique (see examples in [4]). There are two ways to insure the

uniqueness of solutions. The ﬁrst one is to restrict the set of initial functions [7]. The second

one is to restrict the class of state-dependent delays [14, 16] and work with continuous initial

functions.

If one is interested in continuously diﬀerentiable solutions, we could also apply the solution

manifold approach [21, 7] to the initial value problem (4), (5). We remind the short notation for

the system (4) as ˙u(t) = F (ut). Let us introduce the following subset of ΩC (c.f. (6))

ΩF ≡(cid:8)ϕ = (T0, T ∗

0 , V0, A0, Y0) ∈ C1

+[−h, 0]; ϕ ∈ ΩC ;

The following result is a corollary of Theorem 2.

˙ϕ(0) = F (ϕ)(cid:9) .

(13)

Theorem 6. Let η : C → [0, h] be a continuous functional (state dependent delay), satisfying

(H1η). Then for any initial function ϕ ∈ ΩF there exists a unique (continuously diﬀerentiable)

solution to (4), (5), satisfying

ut ≡ (Tt, T ∗

t , Vt, At, Yt) ∈ ΩF ,

t ≥ 0.

One can see that any continuous solution u started at ϕ ∈ ΩC , satisﬁes ut ∈ ΩF for t > h.

2.1 Stationary solutions

We look for stationary solutions of (4). Consider the system with u(t) = u(t − η(ut)) = bu and
denote the coordinates of a stationary solution by (bT ,cT ∗,bV ,bY , bA) = bu ≡ bϕ(θ), θ ∈ [−h, 0]. We

6

have

0 = βcT ∗bY − γbY
0 = gbAbV − bbA.
. To insure the positivity of bA we assume the constants in the

g . Using this, the

as follows (see e.g.

Now we substitute the value bV = b
quadratic equation for bT

(16)

dgk1bT 2 + (dk2b + dg − λgk1 + kb)bT − λ(g + k2b) = 0.

One can easily see that the discriminant of the above equation is positive and there are two roots

following assumption

of diﬀerent signs. We denote below by bT the unique positive root. The ﬁrst two equations in (14)
give (remind that cT ∗ is already known) bY = λ−d bT −eωh δcT ∗
. The positivity of bY follows from the
λ > dbT + δγβ−1eωh,
where bT is the unique positive root of the quadratic equation (16).

We notice that, from biological point of view, (H2), (H3) are standard assumptions on repro-

eωh pcT ∗

(H3)

(17)

duction numbers, which are given here in a short form. We could summarize the above calculations

in the following

Lemma 7. Let assumptions (H2) and (H3) be satisﬁed (see (15), (17)). Then the system (14)

has a unique solution (bT ,cT ∗,bV ,bY , bA) (the unique stationary solution of (4)). All the coordinates
are positive, bT is the unique positive root of the quadratic equation (16) and coordinates satisfy

These equations connecting the coordinates of the stationary solution will be used below in the

(18)

study of the stability properties (c.f. (14)).

3 Stability properties

The function v(x) = x − 1 − ln x for x > 0 plays an important role in construction of Lyapunov

functionals. One can easily check that v(x) ≥ 0 and v(x) = 0 if and only if x = 1. The derivative

7

equals ˙v(x) = 1− 1

x , which is evidently negative for x ∈ (0, 1) and positive for x > 1. The graph of v

explains the use of the composition v(cid:0) x

x0(cid:1) in the study of the stability properties of an equilibrium

x0. Another important property is the following estimate

∀δ ∈ (0, 1) ∀x ∈ (1 − δ, 1 + δ)

one has

(x − 1)2

2(1−δ)(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤
dx(cid:16) (x−1)2

As before, we denote u(t) = (T (t), T ∗(t), V (t), Y (t), A(t)).
Consider arbitrary ϕ =
(ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3, ϕ4, ϕ5) ∈ C. We are interested in the following particular form of the state-dependent

delay

η(ϕ) = F (ϕ1(0), ϕ3(0)).

(20)

It means that η(ut) = F (T (t), V (t)) which looks natural since the delay appears in the nonlinearity

f which depends on T and V only (see the second equation in (4)).

Theorem 8. Let assumptions (H2) and (H3) be satisﬁed (see (15), (17)). Assume the state-

dependent delay η has the form (20) with a continuous F : R2

+ → [0, h], satisﬁes (H1η) (see (7))

and

(21)

Proof of Theorem 8. Consider the Lyapunov functional

|η(ϕ) − η(bϕ)| = |F (ϕ1(0), ϕ3(0)) − F (bT ,bV )| ≤ cη(cid:16)(ϕ1(0) − bT )2 + (ϕ3(0) −bV )2(cid:17) .

small values of cη, the stationary solution is globally asymptotically stable.

Then the stationary solution bϕ = (bT ,cT ∗,bV ,bY , bA) is locally asymptotically stable. For suﬃciently

dt U 1(t) = 0 at the stationary point only. To estimate the term S1(t) we notice that

2 · |V (t − η(ut)) − V (t − η(bϕ)))| .

Remark 10. Both coordinates T (t) and V (t) of a solution u(t) of (4) are Lipschitz in time.

We denote the corresponding Lipschitz constants for arbitrary solution as LT

that for any δ-neighborhood of the stationary point bϕ the Lipschitz constants of arbitrary solution
|ut − bϕ| ≤ δ (inside of the neighborhood) is uniformly bounded i.e. LT

Moreover, LT,δ → 0, LV,δ → 0 as δ → 0.

u ≤ LT,δ, LV ≤ LV,δ.

Remark 11. It is easy to see from the calculations above that the small value of |T ∗(t) −cT ∗|
dt U 1(t) < 0. No need to ask the values of |T (t) − bT |, |V (t) −bV | to be small. On the
other hand, the small values of |T (t) − bT |, |V (t) −bV | give d
|T ∗(t) −cT ∗|.

The previous remark suggests that, alternatively, the smaller value of constant cη (see (21) and
dt U 1(t) < 0 holds. The latter implies that in case cη is suﬃciently
small, the stationary solution is globally stable. Here the LaSalle invariance principle (see e.g.
dt U 1(t) = 0
[20, Theorem 5.17, p.80]) is applied. To show that the maximal invariant subset of d
is the stationary solution only, we use the form of d
dt U 1(t) = 0 iﬀ

dt U 1(t) < 0 without the need of small

dt U 1(t) (we have shown that d

dt U 1(t) = −D1(t) + S1(t) < 0.

(30)) the bigger the set where d

alone gives d

D1(t) = 0). We notice that T (t) = bT , T ∗(t) =cT ∗, V (t) = bV follows immediately from (28). Hence
the second equation of (4) implies 0 = ˙T ∗(t) = e−ωhf (bT ,bV ) − δcT ∗ − pY (t)cT ∗. Similarly, the third
equation of (4) gives 0 = ˙V (t) = N δcT ∗ − cbV − qA(t)bV . Clearly, (14) implies Y (t) ≡ bY , A(t) ≡ bA.

The proof of Theorem 8 is complete. (cid:3)

3.2 General case

Now we are interested in continuously diﬀerentiable solutions, given by Theorem 6. As we men-

tioned above, for any solution u, satisfying u0 ∈ ΩC , one has ut ∈ ΩF for t > h.

Theorem 12. Let assumptions (H2) and (H3) be satisﬁed (see (15), (17)). Assume the state-

dependent delay η : C → [0, h] is continuously diﬀerentiable in a µ-neighborhood of the stationary

delay along a solution of (4)

Proof of Theorem 12. Let us introduce the following Lyapunov functional with state-dependent

solution bϕ and satisﬁes (H1η) (see (7)).
Then the stationary solution bϕ = (bT ,cT ∗,bV ,bY , bA) of (4) is locally asymptotically stable.

(33)

due to the boundedness of ||(Dη)(ψ)||L(C;R) as µ → 0 (here ||ψ −bϕ||C < µ).

The time derivative of U sdd(t) along a continuously diﬀerentiable solution u of (4) is computed

and Ssdd(t) is deﬁned in (32).

(34)

First, we observe that Dsdd(t) and D1(t) have similar forms, while Ssdd(t) and S1(t) are essen-

tially diﬀerent. Moreover, in general case, we can not use (20), (21).

Our goal is to prove that there is a neighborhood of bu ∈ C, where d
point bu). We notice that Dsdd(t) ≥ 0, while the sign of Ssdd(t) is undeﬁned. We will show that

there is a neighborhood of the stationary point, where |Ssdd(t)| < Dsdd(t).

Let us consider the following auxiliary functionals D(5)(x) and S(5)(x), deﬁned on R5, where
we simplify notations x = (x(1), x(2), x(3), x(4), x(5)) ∈ R5 for x(1) = T, x(2) = T ∗, x(3) = V, x(4) =
T (t − η), x(5) = V (t − η)

c(1), c(2) > 0.

The reason to consider functions D(5)(x) and S(5)(x) comes from the property (19) of the function

v. One sees that D(5)(x) = 0 if and only if x = bu ≡ (bT ,cT ∗,bV ,bY , bA). Now we change the

coordinates in R5 to the spherical ones

x(1) = bT + r cos ξ4 cos ξ3 cos ξ2 cos ξ1,

x(4) = bY + r cos ξ4 sin ξ3,
x(5) = bA + r sin ξ4,

r ≥ 0, ξ1 ∈ [0, 2π), ξi ∈ [−π/2, π/2], i = 2, ..., 5.

One can check that the form of D(5)(x) (see (35)) gives the multiplier r2 in front of the sum, i.e.
D(5)(x) = r2 · Φ(r, ξ1, ..., ξ5), where Φ(r, ξ1, ..., ξ5) is continuous and Φ(r, ξ1, ..., ξ5) 6= 0 for r 6= 0.
The last property is proved, for example, assuming the opposite Φ(r0, ξ0
5 ) = 0 for r0 6= 0,
which contradicts (19). Hence, the classical extreme value theorem (the Bolzano–Weierstrass

1, ..., ξ0

theorem) shows that the continuous Φ on a closed neighborhood of bu has a minimum Φmin > 0.

It gives D(5)(x) ≥ r2 · Φmin.

(38)

Now the similar arguments for S(5)(x) shows that |S(5)(x)| ≤ αµ · r2 where the constant αδ → 0

as µ → 0 (see (33)). Finally, we can choose a small enough µ > 0 to satisfy αµ < Φmin which
proves that d

dt U sdd(t) ≤ −cr2 · (Φmin − αµ) < 0.

The proof of Theorem 12 is complete. (cid:3)

Remark 14. One sees that S(5)(x) depends on x(4), x(5) only (36). On the other hand, the

variables x(4), x(5) are used in D(5)(x) in one term (cid:16) cT ∗ ·f (x(4),x(5))

mention that the term in D(5)(x) is not enough to bound |S(5)(x)| i.e.

The sum of all terms in (35) is needed to bound |S(5)(x)|. To see it, one should compare the

sets where each functional vanishes. Denote the zero-sets as ZS(5) and Zrhs (for the right-hand
side of (38)). Then one sees that ZS(5) * Zrhs. Moreover, in any neighborhood of the point

while the the left-hand side is positive. Clearly, the coordinates of such points should satisfy

(x(2), x(4), x(5)) = (cT ∗,bT ,bV ) ∈ R3 one can ﬁnd points where the right-hand side of (38) is zero,
f (x(4), x(5)) 6= f (bT ,bV ), cT ∗ · f (x(4), x(5)) = x(2) · f (bT ,bV ).
