The kinematic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (kSZ) eﬀect — the Doppler boosting of cosmic microwave
background (CMB) photons due to Compton-scattering oﬀ free electrons with non-zero bulk velocity
— is an ideal tool to probe the abundance and distribution of baryons in the Universe. All kSZ
measurements to date have explicitly required spectroscopic redshifts. Here, we implement a novel
estimator for the kSZ – large-scale structure cross-correlation based on projected ﬁelds:
it does
not require redshift estimates for any individual objects, allowing kSZ measurements from large-
scale imaging surveys for the ﬁrst time. We apply this estimator to cleaned CMB temperature maps
constructed from Planck and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data and a galaxy sample from
the Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE ). We measure the kSZ eﬀect at 3.8–4.5σ signiﬁcance,
depending on the use of additional WISE galaxy bias constraints. We verify that our measurements
are robust to possible dust emission from the WISE galaxies. Assuming the standard ΛCDM
cosmology, we directly constrain (fb/0.155) (ffree/1.0) = 1.48±0.19 (statistical error only) at redshift
z ≈ 0.4, where fb is the fraction of matter in baryonic form and ffree is the free electron fraction.
This is the tightest kSZ-derived constraint reported to date on these parameters. Astronomers
have long known that baryons do not trace dark matter on ∼kpc scales and there has been strong
evidence that galaxies are baryon-poor. The consistency between the fb value found here and
the values inferred from analyses of the primordial CMB and Big Bang nucleosynthesis veriﬁes
that baryons approximately trace the dark matter distribution down to ∼Mpc scales. While our
projected-ﬁeld estimator is already competitive with other kSZ approaches when applied to current
datasets (because we are able to use the full-sky WISE photometric survey), it will yield enormous
signal-to-noise when applied to upcoming high-resolution, multi-frequency CMB surveys.

Introduction— In the standard cosmological paradigm,
the primordial cosmic microwave background (CMB)
anisotropies [1–3] and the abundance of light elements
formed in the primordial plasma [4], known as Big Bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN), imply that the baryon density
(ρb) is approximately one-sixth of the total matter den-
sity (ρm): fb ≡ ρb/ρm = 0.155 [3]. Yet, in galaxies, the
inferred baryon/dark matter ratio is roughly a factor 2–3
lower [5, 6]. The “missing baryons” are thought to re-
side in an ionized, diﬀuse, warm-hot plasma, which has
been diﬃcult to detect in X-ray emission or absorption
line studies, although recent Hubble Space Telescope ob-
servations indicate that many such baryons are indeed
located in the circumgalactic medium of typical
low-
redshift galaxies (z ≈ 0.2) [7].

In this paper, we measure the cross-correlation of the
kinematic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (kSZ) eﬀect and the dis-
tribution of infrared-selected galaxies using a novel esti-
mator. We infer a baryon/dark matter ratio consistent
with the cosmological value: this measurement implies
that most of the baryons are in ionized gas tracing the
dark matter on ∼Mpc scales and above.

The kSZ eﬀect arises from the Doppler boosting of
CMB photons as they Compton-scatter oﬀ free electrons
moving with a non-zero line-of-sight (LOS) velocity with
respect to the CMB rest frame [8–10]. This eﬀect leads to

a shift in the observed CMB temperature in the direction
of the electrons, with an amplitude proportional to the
mass in electrons and their LOS velocity, which is equally
likely to be positive or negative. Since the electrons and
dark matter are expected to move in the same large-scale
velocity ﬁeld, the kSZ signal traces the overall mass dis-
tribution, unlike the thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (tSZ)
eﬀect, whose amplitude is proportional to the electron
pressure and is thus primarily sourced by galaxy groups
and clusters [11, 12].

[14]).

The kSZ eﬀect was ﬁrst detected recently using data
from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) [13] by
studying the pairwise momenta of galaxy groups and
clusters (e.g.,
Subsequent detections using the
pairwise-momentum estimator and a velocity-ﬁeld recon-
struction estimator [21, 22] were reported by Planck [23]
and ACTPol [24]1. Crucially, these estimators rely ex-
plicitly on spectroscopic data, which is much more ex-
pensive and time-consuming to acquire than photometric
imaging data. Even excellent photometric redshifts lead
to signiﬁcantly decreased signal-to-noise (S/N ) for these
estimators, compared to spectroscopic data [25, 26].

1 A high-resolution analysis of an individual galaxy cluster also

found evidence for the kSZ eﬀect in that system [15, 16].

2

Here, we implement a kSZ estimator based on pro-
jected ﬁelds: it can be applied to any large-scale structure
sample, including galaxies, quasars, or gravitational lens-
ing maps, allowing analyses of densely-sampled, full-sky
surveys. First suggested in Refs. [19, 20], the estimator
relies on the fact that a frequency-cleaned CMB temper-
ature map contains kSZ information on small scales, re-
gardless of whether external velocity information is avail-
able. The kSZ information can be accessed in cross-
correlation with tracers of the large-scale density ﬁeld.
To avoid the cancellation of positive and negative kSZ
signals (which are equally likely), we square the CMB
temperature map in real space before cross-correlating.2
This kSZ2–tracer cross-correlation probes a wider
range of physical scales than those accessible to the pair-
wise velocity method. On large scales, this method con-
strains fb or ffree without the need for individual halo
mass estimates. Here, ffree denotes the fraction of elec-
trons that are not bound in neutral media, and thus take
part in Compton scattering.

We measure the kSZ2–tracer cross-correlation in this
Letter using data from Planck [27], the Wilkinson Mi-
crowave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP ) [28], and the Wide-
ﬁeld Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE ) [29]. In a compan-
ion paper [30] (hereafter F16), we provide theoretical de-
tails, compare to numerical simulations, and investigate
the potential reach of this method for upcoming surveys.
We assume the best-ﬁt Planck + WMAP polarization
ΛCDM cosmological parameters [3] (the ﬁnal column of
their Table 2).

To downweight angular scales dominated by primary
CMB ﬂuctuations and detector noise, we apply a ﬁl-
ter F(cid:96) in harmonic space [19], F(cid:96) = C kSZ
, where
C kSZ
is
the total ﬂuctuation power, which includes the primary
CMB, kSZ eﬀect, integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) eﬀect,
noise, and any residual foregrounds. We use a theoretical
kSZ power spectrum template derived from cosmological
hydrodynamics simulations [33] and semi-analytic mod-
els [34]. Furthermore, as the CMB is observed through
a ﬁnite telescope beam b(cid:96) (in our case, a Gaussian with
FWHM = 5 arcmin), the total ﬁltered map is related to
the true CMB anisotropy by Θf ((cid:96)) = F(cid:96)b(cid:96)Θ((cid:96)) ≡ f(cid:96)Θ((cid:96)),
where we have deﬁned f(cid:96) = F(cid:96)b(cid:96). F(cid:96) is shown in F16.
Direct cross-correlation of ΘkSZ and δg is expected to
vanish due to the ve → −ve symmetry of the kSZ sig-
nal (i.e., positive or negative LOS velocities are equally
likely). We thus square the ﬁltered ΘkSZ in real space
before cross-correlating with δg [19, 20]. In the Limber

correlation of the WISE galaxies with Planck CMB lens-

gence). Alternatively, the lensing contamination can

Data— The kSZ signal is extracted from a frequency-
cleaned CMB temperature map [39]3, which we fur-
ther clean using methods described below. This map
is constructed from a joint analysis of the nine-year
WMAP [28] and Planck full mission [27] full-sky tem-
perature maps. The CMB is separated from other com-
ponents in the microwave sky using “local-generalized
morphological component analysis” (LGMCA), a tech-
nique relying on the sparse distribution of non-CMB fore-
grounds in the wavelet domain [31, 32]. The method re-
constructs a full-sky CMB map with minimal dust con-
tamination. Importantly for our purposes, the tSZ sig-
nal is explicitly projected out in the map construction
(unlike in, e.g., the Planck SEVEM, NILC, or SMICA
component-separated CMB maps [40]). Components
that preserve the CMB blackbody spectrum are not re-
moved, including the kSZ and ISW signals.

To isolate the kSZ signal in the LGMCA tempera-
ture map, we apply a ﬁlter as described above. We set
C tot

spectrum of the LGMCA map. We further set the ﬁlter

(cid:96)

to zero at (cid:96) ∼< 100 and (cid:96) ∼> 3000 in order to remove ISW

contamination and noise-dominated modes, respectively.
We multiply by appropriate hyperbolic tangent functions
at these boundaries to allow the ﬁlter to smoothly in-
terpolate to zero, and normalize the ﬁlter such that its
maximum value is unity, which occurs at (cid:96) ≈ 2200 (see
F16).
We construct a galaxy sample from WISE, which im-
aged the sky in four photometric bands between 3.4 and
22 µm. We use the same color-based selection criteria as
Ref. [41], originally based on Ref. [42]. The redshift dis-
tribution of these galaxies was obtained in Ref. [43], with
a peak around z ≈ 0.3 and extending to z ≈ 1 (mean
(cid:104)z(cid:105) ≈ 0.4). Their luminosities are similar to that of the

Milky Way (L ∼ L∗). We apply a conservative Galactic

mask to remove stellar contamination (which would not
bias our results in any case, but only add to the noise).
We combine this mask with a conservative point-source
mask removing all sources detected at > 5σ in the Planck
data (as in Ref. [44]), leaving a sky fraction fsky = 0.447
and 46.2 million WISE galaxies.

We use the Planck CMB lensing maps to place external
constraints on the WISE galaxy bias bg. We consider
both the 2013 [45] and 2015 maps [46].

kSZ2×δg
Analysis— We apply the C
(cid:96)

estimator described
above to the ﬁltered LGMCA temperature map and the
WISE galaxy density map. Although the LGMCA map
already shows very little dust contamination, we explic-
itly remove any residual dust associated with the WISE
galaxies by ﬁnding the value of α that nulls the cross-
correlation of δg and ((1 + α)TLGMCA − αTdust), where
Tdust is a dust template constructed from a CMB-free
combination of the ﬁltered Planck 217 and 545 GHz
maps [47]: Tdust = 1.0085(T545 − T217). We ﬁnd a best-
ﬁt αmin = −0.0002 ± 0.0001 and subsequently construct
Tclean = (1 + αmin)TLGMCA − αminTdust. All results that
follow are nearly identical whether we use Tclean, the orig-
inal TLGMCA, or a version of Tclean constructed using the
Planck 857 GHz map as a dust template.

T 2
Our measurement of C
(cid:96)

is shown in Fig. 1. The
dominant oscillatory shape is due to the CMB lensing
contribution. We measure the signal in thirteen linearly-
spaced multipole bins between (cid:96) = 300 and (cid:96) = 2900 (bin
width ∆(cid:96) = 200). The lower multipole limit ensures that
no ISW signal is present. We correct for the eﬀects of
the mask (which is apodized with a Gaussian taper of
FWHM = 10 arcmin) using standard methods [48] (note
that the beam window function is forward-modeled in the
theory calculations as described above). Error bars on
the cross-power spectrum are estimated in the Gaussian
approximation using the measured auto-spectra of the
T 2
clean and δg maps.
We consider several null tests to ensure that our mea-
surement is not an artifact or the result of dust contam-
ination. We process an LGMCA noise map (Tnoise) con-
structed from the half-diﬀerence of splits of the Planck
and WMAP data. The resulting cross-correlation of
Tnoise with δg is consistent with null (probability-to-
exceed p = 0.63), as is T 2
noise with δg (p = 0.27). We
can consider the cross-correlation of Tclean (not squared)
with δg as a null test for the mean dust contamination
(top panel of Fig. 2). The result is consistent with null
(p = 0.19). Note that the original TLGMCA map also
passes this test with p = 0.07, indicating that it is al-
ready dust-cleaned, though not as thoroughly as Tclean.

with WISE galaxies (green circles). The thick blue, dashed
black, and thin red curves show the best-ﬁt kSZ, CMB lens-
ing, and kSZ + lensing power spectra, respectively. The kSZ
signal is detected at 3.8σ signiﬁcance. No external galaxy
bias constraint is used in these ﬁts; including a prior from
cross-correlating the WISE galaxies with Planck CMB lens-
ing maps produces nearly identical best-ﬁt results (see Ta-
ble I), with a kSZ signiﬁcance of 4–4.5σ. For visual purposes
only, the magenta squares show the residual excess left after
subtracting the best-ﬁt lensing template from the data points.

If a signiﬁcant amount of WISE -galaxy-
dust tracer.
correlated dust is present in Tclean, we should see a strong
signal in this null test. The result is consistent with null
(p = 0.02). Furthermore, rescaling the measured ampli-
tude using a standard dust greybody spectrum from 545
GHz (the Tdust template frequency) to the CMB channels
that dominate TLGMCA (and Tclean) at ≈ 100–217 GHz
indicates that the dust contribution to the data points in
Fig. 1 is (cid:46) 0.003 µK2.

To further test possible dust leakage due to ﬂuctuat-
ing spectral indices amongst the WISE galaxies (which
might not be fully removed in Tclean), we construct sim-
ulations in which each galaxy is assigned a greybody
spectrum with index β drawn from a Gaussian of mean
1.75 and standard deviation 0.06 (values from [49]). The
dust temperature is assumed to be 20 K and the ampli-
tude is set by stacking the 857 GHz map at the loca-
tion of the WISE galaxies (likely an overestimate, since
Galactic dust is also present in this map). We then gen-
erate pairs of maps at various Planck frequencies and
construct the linear combination that cancels the mean
greybody spectrum and preserves the CMB blackbody
spectrum. Processing these residual maps through our
pipeline, we ﬁnd cross-correlations with δg that are (cid:38) 100
times smaller than the measured C
signal. These
tests establish that any dust leakage in our kSZ2–WISE

≈ 400–500) yields a dust contribution to the data points in
Fig. 1 of (cid:46) 0.003 µK2, well below the statistical errors.

timate full covariance matrices using 100 Planck CMB
lensing simulations (separately for the 2013 and 2015
analyses). Fitting the 2015 measurement to a theoret-
ical model based on the most recent “haloﬁt” prescrip-
tion for the non-linear matter power spectrum [50], we
ﬁnd bg = 1.13 ± 0.02. We obtain consistent results with
the 2013 lensing map (see also [41]) or if we restrict to
100 < (cid:96) < 400, where theoretical uncertainties due to
nonlinearity are signiﬁcantly diminished.

sider three analysis scenarios (see Table I). Initially, we
determine AkSZ2 and bg using only C
. Due to the
diﬀerent shapes of the theoretical templates (see Fig. 1),
both amplitudes can be robustly measured. The kSZ2

spectively. The kSZ2 S/N is only slightly decreased by
marginalizing over bg;
if bg were perfectly known, the

scribes the data well, with χ2 = 13.1 for 11 degrees of

fraction of electrons bound in neutral media (e.g., stars
or neutral hydrogen gas). Therefore, our measurement of
fb is consistent with the predicted abundance of baryons
from the primordial CMB and BBN. This is the tightest

there are theoretical uncertainties due to our extrapola-
tion of the BNL
m ﬁtting function [36] to high wavenumbers
where it was not explicitly calibrated, and also due to our
use of linear theory for calculating v2
rms. In addition, the
lensing contamination template is subject to uncertain-
ties at high-(cid:96) due to nonlinear evolution and baryonic
physics. However, our comparison to simulations in F16
indicates that the approximations made in our analysis
are accurate.

verse and that their distribution traces that of the dark
matter (an assumption in our model), within the sta-
tistical errors. The novel projected-ﬁeld estimator im-
plemented here allows kSZ measurements with photo-
metric imaging surveys for the ﬁrst time, covering much
larger sky fractions and tracer samples than spectro-
scopic data. In turn, this will yield enormous S/N detec-
tions with upcoming multi-frequency CMB surveys (see
F16), especially for high-resolution experiments that ac-
cess the kSZ-dominated modes on small angular scales.
We forecast (cid:38) 100σ kSZ2–WISE cross-correlations using
the upcoming Advanced ACTPol [51] and CMB-S4 sur-
veys, contingent on the eﬃciency of multi-frequency fore-
ground cleaning. These high-resolution measurements
will directly probe the baryon distribution as a function
of scale and redshift, and the inﬂuence of baryons on the
small-scale matter power spectrum. Moreover, combin-
ing kSZ constraints with tSZ analyses will directly deter-
mine the gas temperature at the virial radius and beyond.
Finally, kSZ – large-scale structure cross-correlations will
be essential to isolate the high-redshift kSZ signal due to
“patchy” cosmic reionization from the low-redshift kSZ
signal studied here. This work is a ﬁrst step toward real-
izing these exciting new probes of the distribution of gas
and matter in our Universe.
