The Halphen cubics of order two

Thomas Bauer, Brian Harbourne, Joaquim Ro´e, Tomasz Szemberg

March 16, 2016

Abstract. For each m > 1, Roulleau and Urz´ua give an implicit con-
struction of a conﬁguration of 4(3m2 − 1) complex plane cubic curves.
This construction was crucial for their work on surfaces of general type.
We make this construction explicit by proving that the Roulleau-Urz´ua
conﬁguration consists precisely of the Halphen cubics of order m, and we
determine speciﬁc equations of the cubics for m = 1 (which were known)
and for m = 2 (which are new).

Introduction

For each n = 3m, we study certain arrangements of 4
3 (n2−3) plane cubic curves; each
curve is isomorphic to the Fermat cubic x3 + y3 + z3 (i.e., to T = C/Z[ζ], ζ = e2πi/6).
For n = 3, the eight curves in the arrangement were known from invariant theory
[2] and give the “inscribed and circumscribed” cubics [1, Proposition 5.2] for the
four singular cubics in the Hesse pencil hx3 + y3 + z3, xyzi, but for m > 1 the
arrangements are described explicitly here for the ﬁrst time.

These arrangements come from arrangements of 4n2 elliptic curves on the abelian
surface T × T , studied by Hirzebruch in [11]. Using a quotient by a ﬁnite group
action followed by a blow up to resolve singularities, Roulleau and Urz´ua obtain in
[14, section 3] corresponding arrangements of 4
3 (n2 − 3) elliptic curves on a rational
surface they call H, whose images (see [13, Section 1]) under a birational morphism
to P2 give the arrangements of plane cubics we study here. The Roulleau-Urz´ua
arrangements on H were crucial for their construction of surfaces of general type in
[14]. In [13], Roulleau shows that the corresponding arrangements of plane cubics
are interesting for another reason: the Harbourne index of the union Cn of the

3 (n2 − 3) cubics has limit −4 as n → ∞. We note that no reduced plane curve is
yet known with Harbourne index less than or even equal to −4.

The arrangements of cubics as given in [13] are not given explicitly; they are
described only as images under birational maps.
In this paper we construct the
same arrangements of cubics by elementary methods directly on P2, which allows
us to give explicit equations for these interesting cubics.
In the case n = 3, the
corresponding eight cubics coincide with the classical Halphen cubics [9, 1, 2, 8].
For n = 3m with m > 1, they are members of four pencils, where each pencil is
spanned by two of the eight Halphen cubics. We call these pencils Hesse singular
point cubic pencils.
(The reason for this name is that these pencils can also be
obtained from the singular points of the four singular cubics in the Hesse pencil.
Each of these singular cubics has three singular points. Thus each choice of three of
the four singular cubics in the Hesse pencil deﬁnes 9 points, and these 9 points are
the base points of a cubic pencil. The four pencils deﬁned this way are precisely the
four pencils obtained from the eight Halphen cubics.) The speciﬁc members chosen
from each Hesse singular point cubic pencil depend on the 3m-torsion points of T ,
so we refer to the speciﬁc cubics chosen as the Halphen cubics of order m.

Our construction relies on classical facts known for the so-called dual Hesse
conﬁguration of 9 lines in the plane meeting by threes on 12 points, and on the
geometry of the curve T . The Weierstrass function ℘′ is a morphism to P1 of degre
3, which in the case of T is triply ramiﬁed at 3 points. For each positive integer m, we
denote by P1[n] the images of the n-torsion points of T . As noted above, the Hesse
singular point cubic pencils are deﬁned by taking as base points subsets of 9 points
among the 12 vertices of the dual Hesse conﬁguration; each pencil has 3 reducible
members which are composed of lines of the conﬁguration. We parameterize the
pencils so that the reducible members correspond to parameters u ∈ P1 belonging
to the branch locus of ℘′. Then the Halphen cubics of order m are deﬁned as the
cubics in the Hesse singular point cubic pencils with parameters in P1[3m]. Our ﬁrst
result is the following:

Theorem 1 For each n ∈ 3N, let H(n) be the union of all Halphen cubics of order
n/3. The singularities of H(n) are: 12 points of multiplicity n2 − 3 at the vertices
of the dual Hesse conﬁguration, with n2/3 − 1 triple points inﬁnitely near to them,
and (n2 − 3)(n2/3 − 3) quadruple points.

As a corollary the Harbourne index of H(n) tends to -4 as n grows. The con-
ﬁguration of Halphen cubics therefore behaves like the Roulleau-Urz´ua conﬁgura-
tion over which it is modelled. Our second goal is to understand the rational map
T × T 99K P2 used by Roulleau and Urz´ua to construct their conﬁguration. In The-
orem 2.1 we determine the linear series associated to the map, and using the action
of the theta group, we prove that both conﬁgurations agree:

Theorem 2 The curves that form the Roulleau-Urz´ua conﬁguration corresponding
to the n-torsion points for n = 3m are the Halphen cubics of m-th order.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 1 we recall the classical construction
of Hesse line conﬁgurations and Halphen cubics, and we prove Theorem 1 along with
additional information on the position of the singularities (Theorem 1.5). Section 2 is
devoted to the study of the Roulleau-Urz´ua conﬁguration and the map T ×T 99K P2,
and culminates in the proof of Theorem 2.

1 The Hesse conﬁgurations and Halphen cubics

Recall the construction of the so-called Hesse conﬁgurations (a modern account of
this classical subject can be found in the book [7, Section 3.1], see also [1] and
references therein for their history and attributions).

Given a smooth plane cubic C and a line ℓ joining two ﬂexes of C, the third
intersection of ℓ and C is another ﬂex. Altogether, there are 12 such lines of ﬂexes,
and at each of the 9 ﬂexes of C exactly 4 of the 12 lines meet. This conﬁguration of
lines and points is classically called the Hesse line arrangement (123, 94); it does not
depend on the choice of a cubic, i.e., the sets of 9 ﬂex points of any smooth plane
cubic are projectively equivalent.

A triangle containing all 9 ﬂexes is called a triangle of ﬂexes; there are 4 such
triangles which together form the Hesse arrangement. They can be obtained as
follows. Fix one of the ﬂexes p0 as the zero for the group law on C; then the 9 ﬂexes
of C form the 3-torsion subgroup C[3] ∼= (Z/3Z)2. Each line of ﬂexes ℓ through p0
cuts on C one of its 4 cyclic subgroups of order 3. The two cosets of this subgroup in
C[3] correspond to the two lines of ﬂexes which do not meet ℓ on C, which toghether
with ℓ form one of the triangles.

The polar curve of C with respect to a ﬂex p is the degenerate conic consisting
of the tangent TpC and another line, called the harmonic polar of p. If ℓ is a line of
ﬂexes, the harmonic polars of the three ﬂexes on ℓ are concurrent, and their point of
intersection is the vertex opposite to ℓ in the triangle of ﬂexes to which it belongs.
Thus, each of the 9 harmonic polars goes through 4 vertices, one on each triangle of
ﬂexes, and at each of the 12 vertices exactly 3 of the 9 lines meet. They form the
dual Hesse arrangement (94, 123), which again does not depend on the cubic.

The given curve C and each triangle of ﬂexes are cubics through the 9 ﬂex points.
It follows that the 9 points of the Hesse conﬁguration are the base points of a pencil
of cubics, called the Hesse pencil; all cubics in the pencil have the same ﬂex points,
and every plane cubic is projectively equivalent to one of the curves in the pencil.
The Hesse pencil has 4 singular members, namely the 4 triangles of ﬂexes. We denote
them Tv, Th, Tδ, Tγ. For convenience we also ﬁx the following notations for the whole
paper: T = {v, h, δ, γ} will be the set of indices for the triangles; Vv = {v0, v1, v∞}
will be the vertices of Tv; and similarly for Vh = {h0, h1, h∞}, Vδ = {δ0, δ1, δ∞}
and Vγ = {γ0, γ1, γ∞} (the symbols v, h, δ, γ, and 0, 1, ∞, are chosen to match with

constructions to appear later on). Moreover we take V = St∈T Vt to denote the

whole set of vertices of the dual Hesse conﬁguration, and for each t ∈ T, Λt = V \ Vt
to be the complement in V of the set of vertices of Tt.

The group of projective transformations of the plane which preserve the Hesse
arrangement (or equivalently the Hesse pencil) is a ﬁnite group G216 called the
Hesse group.
It obviously acts on the set {Tv, Th, Tδ, Tγ}, and the image of the
corresponding representation G216 → S4 is the alternating group A4. Since it is
not the full S4 group, the order of the indices v, h, δ, γ is not entirely innocuous; we
now introduce coordinates in order to be precise, and for later use in the explicit
determination of the Halphen cubics.

Take C to be the Fermat cubic x3 +y3+z3, and let ε denote a primitive third root
of unity. The 9 ﬂex points of C are the points (−1, 1, 0), (−1, ε, 0) and (−1, ε2, 0)
and the 6 other points obtained from these by permutation; it is customary to take
as generators for the Hesse pencil the Fermat cubic C and the triangle Tv = xyz.

4

Thus the three coordinate points

v0 = (1 : 0 : 0),

v1 = (0 : 1 : 0),

v∞ = (0 : 0 : 1)

are three of the vertices of the dual Hesse conﬁguration; the remaining points are

h0 = (1 : 1 : 1),
δ0 = (ε : 1 : 1),
γ0 = (ε2 : 1 : 1),

h1 = (1 : ε : ε2),
δ1 = (1 : ε : 1),
γ1 = (1 : ε2 : 1),

h∞ = (1 : ε2 : ε)

δ∞ = (1 : 1 : ε)

γ∞ = (1 : 1 : ε2)

The equations of the harmonic polar lines forming the dual Hesse conﬁguration can
be obtained using the coordinates of the points. For example the line through the
points v0 and h0 has equation z − y and also goes through δ0 and γ0. We denote
by Li,j,k,l the line through vui, huj , δuk and γul, so the line just considered is L0000.
Evaluating all collinearities we obtain

L0000 = z − y,
L1011 = z − x,
L∞0∞∞ = y − x,

L01∞1 = z − εy,
L110∞ = εz − x,
L∞110 = y − εx,

L0∞1∞ = εz − y
L1∞∞1 = z − εx
L∞∞01 = εy − x

For each t ∈ T, the linear system of cubics through the 9 points in Λt is a
pencil Ct, which we call a Hesse singular point cubic pencil. It has three singular
members, namely, for each vertex tu of Tt, u ∈ {0, 1, ∞}, the union of the three
harmonic polars concurrent at tu is a member of the pencil, which we call Ctu. All
nonsingular members of each pencil have j-invariant equal to zero. Halphen showed
that the locus of 9-torsion points of all curves in the Hesse pencil consists of two
members of these pencils Ch, Cv, Cδ, Cγ (so-called Halphen cubics); the conﬁgurations
of plane cubics described by Roulleau and Urz´ua consist of members of the same
pencils (which we call higher order Halphen cubics).

Later on we shall give explicit equations of the Halphen cubics; for this purpose
we ﬁx a coordinate u in each pencil Ct, such that {0, 1, ∞} correspond to the singular
members. Since the harmonic polars concurrent at tu, in the notation above, are
the Luvuhuδuγ with ut = u, the three singular members of Cv are

Cv0 = ε2Y L0∗∗∗ = ε2(z − y)(z − εy)(εz − y) = z3 − y3
Cv1 = ε2Y L1∗∗∗ = ε2(z − x)(εz − x)(z − εx) = z3 − x3
Cv∞ = ε2Y L∞∗∗∗ = ε2(y − x)(y − εx)(εy − x) = y3 − x3

where the factor ε2 serves only a simpliﬁcation purpose. Similarly, the three singular
memebers of Ch are

− x2y + xy2 + x2z − y2z − xz2 + yz2

Ch0 = Y L∗0∗∗ = (z − y)(z − x)(y − x) =
Ch1 = −Y L∗1∗∗ = −(z − εy)(εz − x)(y − εx) =
Ch∞ = Y L∗∞∗∗ = (εz − y)(z − εx)(εy − x) =

ε2(x2y − ε2xy2 − ε2x2z + y2z + xz2 − ε2yz2)

− ε(x2y − εxy2 − εx2z + y2z + xz2 − εyz2)

where the signs are chosen so that Ch0 + Ch∞ = Ch1. Finally, the singular members
of Cδ and Cγ are

5

− x2y + εxy2 + x2z − ε2y2z − εxz2 + ε2yz2

ε2(x2y − xy2 − ε2x2z + ε2y2z + εxz2 − εyz2)

− ε(x2y − ε2xy2 − εx2z + ε2y2z + εxz2 − yz2)

Cδ0 = Y L∗∗0∗ = (z − y)(εz − x)(εy − x) =
Cδ1 = −Y L∗∗1∗ = −(z − εy)(z − εx)(y − x) =
Cδ∞ = Y L∗∗∞∗ = (εz − y)(z − x)(y − εx) =
Cγ,0 = Y L∗∗∗0 = (εz − y)(εz − x)(y − x) =
Cγ,1 = −Y L∗∗∗1 = −(z − εx)(y − εx)(z − y) =
Cγ,∞ = Y L∗∗∗∞ = (z − εy)(z − x)(εy − x) =

− x2y + xy2 + εx2z − εy2z − ε2xz2 + ε2yz2

ε2(x2y − ε2xy2 − x2z + εy2z + ε2xz2 − εyz2)

− ε(x2y − εxy2 − ε2x2z + εy2z + ε2xz2 − yz2)

With these choices, the member of the pencil Ct corresponding to the parameter
u ∈ C will be Ctu = Ct0 + u Ct∞ for every t ∈ T.

Halphen’s Theorem. Fixing any of the ﬂex points of a plane cubic curve C as
the zero point in the group law, the set of n-torsion points for n = 3m coincides
with the set of points p such that there exists a (possibly reducible) curve of degree
m meeting C only at p; thus the set of 3m-torsion points of a cubic is well deﬁned
and independent of the choice of a ﬂex. Halphen [9] studied the locus of points of
3m-torsion of all cubics in the Hesse pencil. For m = 1 it consists on the 9 base
points, as already said. For m = 2, it is the union of the 9 harmonic polars. For
m = 3 it is the union of 8 cubics, two in each pencil Cu, which we shall describe
next. For m > 3, it is the union of 8 or 9 curves of higher degrees, depending on the
divisibility of m by 3.

Lemma 1.1 Let T be an elliptic curve and f : T → P1 a morphism of degree 3 with
triple ramiﬁcation at 3 points. Then the j-invariant of T is 0, and f is unique up
to translation and inversion on T , and up to automorphisms of P1.

Proof. By the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, there is no more ramiﬁcation than the
three triple points, so E is a 3 sheeted cover of P1 away from these points. Permuting
the sheets of the cover induces an automorphism of E of order 3. But the only elliptic
curves with an order 3 automorphism are those of j-invariant 0, and these support
a single order 3 automorphism (up to translation and inversion), namely complex
multiplication by a cube root of 1 [15, Theorem 10.1].
(cid:3)

The automorphisms of P1 which appear in lemma 1.1 must obviously preserve
the branch locus of f . To take care of these we call marked line a pair P1
M = (P1, M )
where M = {p, q, r} is a set of 3 distinct points in P1. A morphism of marked lines
is an algebraic morphism which preserves the markings (and so any two marked

6

lines are isomorphic). The group of automorphisms of the marked line is ﬁnite,
isomorphic to S3, and by choosing a coordinate u on P1 such that the marking is
M = {0, 1, ∞}, it is generated by the morphisms u 7→ u−1 and u 7→ 1 − u. Then,
given an equianharmonic elliptic curve T and a marked line P1
M , there exixts a
morphism f : T → P1 of degree 3, with triple ramiﬁcation over M , unique up to
translation and inversion on T , and up to the action of S3 on P1

M .

In classical terminology, elliptic curves with j-invariant equal to zero are called
In the setting of lemma 1.1, consider the grup law on T with

the zero at one of the ramiﬁcation points. Such a curve T is obtained as T =
C/Z[ζ], where ζ = e2πi/6; a degree 3 map is given by the Weierstrass derivative
function ℘′ : T → P1; and the corresponding order three automorphism is induced
by multiplication by ε = ζ 2. Its 3 ﬁxed points, which are the ramiﬁcation points
of ℘′, are pk = k
3 ζ for 0 6 k 6 2. Their images form the branch locus M =
branch(f ) = {i, −i, ∞} ⊂ P1.

3 + k

For every choice of the zero at one of the ramiﬁcation points of f , the other two
ramiﬁcation points are of 3-torsion (in fact they form a cyclic subgroup of order 3,
as can be seen in the description via the ℘′ function) hence for every positive integer
m the set T [3m] of 3m-torsion points on T independent on which ramiﬁcation point
is chosen as zero.

Remark 1.2 Since the permuting of the 3 sheets is an automorphism, if a (non-
ramiﬁcation) point in T is of 3m-torsion, then the remaining two points in its ﬁber
are 3m-torsion as well. So by lemma 1.1 the set of images

P1

M [3m] = f (T [3m]) \ M

(where M = branch(f ) is the branch locus) is a well deﬁned set (independent of any
choices and invariant under isomorphisms of marked lines) consisting of ((3m)2 −
3)/3 = 3m2 − 1 distinct points. We call P1
M [3m] the set of equianharmonic 3m-
torsion parameters relative to the markings M , or simply the set of equianharmonic
3m-torsion parameters (denoted P1[3m]) if M = {0, 1, ∞}.

Corollary 1.3 Let T be an elliptic curve and f : T → P1 a morphism of degree
3 with triple ramiﬁcation at 3 points, and let M = branch(f ). The set f −1(M ∪
P1

M [3m]) is a translate of the subgroup of 3m-torsion.

We will be interested in the explicit determination of P1[3m]. The ﬁrst case cor-
responds to 3-torsion points, m = 1, for which there are 3·12 −1 = 2 equianharmonic
torsion parameters. Invariance under the action of S3 is enough to determine P1
M [3]
as the Hessian pair of the marking M , which can also be characterized as the two
points which together with M form an equianharmonic set (i.e., with cross ratio a
cube root of 1). For M = {0, 1, ∞} one gets P1[3] = {−ε, −ε2} (this is the only set
of 2 points invariant for both t 7→ t−1 and t 7→ 1 − t). P1[6], although more involved,
can be computed using the S3-action as well, but this is not the case for higher m.
Below we compute P1[6] from the deﬁnition, a method that does generalise to all m.

Theorem 1.4 (Halphen, [9, §3]) Consider each pencil Ct, t ∈ T as a marked
line, where the marking consists of the three singular members Ctu with u ∈ {0, 1, ∞}.
Denote Ct[3] the set of two cubics in the pencil that correspond to equianharmonic
3-torsion parameters. Then

Ch[3] ∪ Cv[3] ∪ Cδ[3] ∪ Cγ[3]

7

is the locus of 9-torsion points of curves in the Hesse pencil.

Using the fact that P1[3] = {−ε, −ε2}, the 8 Halphen cubics can be explicitly

written as follows.

Cv−ε = x3 + ε2y3 + εz3
Ch−ε = x2y + y2z + xz2
Cδ−ε = x2y + ε2y2z + εxz2 Cδ−ε2 = xy2 + ε2x2z + εyz2
Cγ−ε = x2y + εy2z + ε2xz2 Cγ−ε2 = xy2 + εx2z + ε2yz2

Cv−ε2 = x3 + εy3 + ε2z3
Ch−ε2 = xy2 + x2z + yz2

This same list also arises in a somewhat diﬀerent way in [2, 8] and [1, Proposition 5.2],
where a modern account of Halphen’s theorem is given. In addition to computing
the 9-torsion of members of the Hesse pencil, the Halphen cubics are special in their
Hesse singular point cubic pencils, in the following ways. First, the base points
of the pencil are a translate (with respect to the group law of the Halphen cubic)
of its set of 3-torsion points; and second, they intersect one another only in base
points, tangently in sets of three (from distinct pencils). It is these latter properties
that we seek to generalize in higher order Halphen cubics. Denote Ct[3m] the union
of the 3m2 − 1 cubics in the pencil Ct corresponding to equianharmonic 3m-torsion
parameters, and call them the Halphen cubics of order m. In order to better describe
their intersections we consider the blow up X → P2 at the 12 points of V , and denote
˜Ct[3m] the strict transforms. Denote L the pullback to X of the class of a line, Etu
the exceptional divisor above the point tu, E the sum of all 12 exceptionals, and

Et = Xt′

u∈Λt

Et′

u = Xt′6=t

u∈{0,1,∞}

the divisor above the 9 point set Λt; thus each Hesse singular point cubic pencil can
be written Ct = |3H − Et|. Each exceptional divisor Etu carries a natural marking

Mtu = Etu ∩ ˜Ctu

(2)

consisting of the directions of the three lines in the dual Hesse conﬁguration going
through the point tu (these are the component lines of Ctu). In the sequel, unless ex-
plicitly speciﬁed, the equianharmonic torsion points on Etu will always be considered
with respect to the natural marking, and we denote them Etu[3m] = (Etu )Mtu [3m].

Note that, for each t′ 6= t we have

Theorem 1.5 The reducible curve Hm = ˜Ch[3m] ∪ ˜Cv[3m] ∪ ˜Cδ[3m] ∪ ˜Cγ[3m] belongs
to the linear system |12(3m2 −1)L−9(3m2−1)E|, and has the following singularities:

1. 3m2 − 1 ordinary triple points on each Etu , for a total of 12(3m2 − 1) triple

points;

2. 9(3m2 − 1)(m2 − 1) ordinary quadruple points oﬀ E.

Moreover, each component of the curve passes through 9 of the triple points and
9(m2 − 1) of the quadruple points, which together constitute a translate of its 3m-
torsion subgroup.

8

Proof. The linear equivalence class is clear from the fact that Ct[3m] ∼ (3m2 −
1) (3L − Et) .

Each pencil ˜Ct induces an elliptic ﬁbration φt : X → P1 for which the 9 ex-
ceptional components above Λt are sections. For every exceptional component Etu ,
three of the ﬁbrations have it as a section (those φt′ with t′
6= t), and for the
remaining ﬁbration φt, it is a component of a ﬁber, with multiplicity 3. Indeed,

t (φt(Ctu )) = ˜Ctu + 3Etu
φ−1

(4)

because Ctu has multiplicity 3 at tu.

Any two pencils among the 4 share 6 base points, and hence have intersection
number 32 − 6 = 3. The restriction of φh, φδ and φγ to any smooth curve ˜Cvs, s ∈
C\{0, 1} in the pencil ˜Cv gives therefore a morphism of degree 3, φt| ˜Cvs
: ˜Cv,s → Ev0 .
Since tu is a base point of Cv for each t 6= v and u ∈ {0, 1, ∞} ˜Cvs meets Etu at a
point p = ptu and by (4),

(cid:16)φt| ˜Cvs(cid:17)−1

(Ctu ∩ Ev0) = ˜Chs ∩(cid:16) ˜Ctu + 3Etu(cid:17) > 3p,

but since the degree of the map is 3, the inequality must in fact be an equality (so ˜Chs
meets no point on ˜Ctu and the intersection with Etu is transversal). This holds for all
has triple ramiﬁcation above Mh0. As the action of the Hesse
u ∈ {0, 1, ∞}, so φt| ˜Chs
group on T is 2-transitive, for every t 6= t′ the restriction of φt to a ﬁber ˜Ct′
s has triple
has no additional ramiﬁcation (by Riemann-
ramiﬁcation above Mt′
. Since φt|Ct′
Hurwitz) all intersections between ˜Ct′
s and nonsingular ﬁbers of φt are transversal.
Therefore, intersections between components of Hm (which are nonsingular ﬁbers
of the pencils) are transversal; this means that all multiple points of Hm, which are
generated by such intersections, are ordinary. Moreover, by corollary 1.3,

there are three components of Hm, one in each pencil Ct, t 6= t′. These points are

Taking into account the linear equivalence class of the Ct and the intersection
product on X, we see that besides the triple points, each pair ˜Ct[3m], ˜Ct′[3m] intersect
at 9(3m2 − 1)(m2 − 1) additional points. The proof will be complete by showing
that these belong to the two remaining ˜Ct′′[3m]’s. We accomplish this by proving
that, for every component ˜Cvs of ˜Cv[3m], the sets

Ah = ˜Cvs ∩ ( ˜Ch[3m] ∪ Eh0 ∪ Eh1 ∪ Eh∞)
Aδ = ˜Cvs ∩ ( ˜Cδ[3m] ∪ Eδ0 ∪ Eδ1 ∪ Eδ∞)

are equal; then

˜Cv[3m] ∩ ˜Ch[3m] \ E = ˜Cv[3m] ∩ ˜Cδ[3m] \ E

and by symmetry all pairs ˜Ct[3m], ˜Ct′[3m] intersect at the same set of 9(3m2 −
1)(m2 − 1) points, which ﬁnishes the proof.

9

Indeed, by corollary 1.3 both Ah and Aδ are obtained from the set of 3m-torsion
points of ˜Cvs by suitable translations according to the group law in ˜Cvs, therefore
Ah = tp(Aδ) for some point p ∈ ˜Cvs. Since ˜Cvs meets Eγ0 at one of the triple points,
which must also belong to ˜Ch[3m] and ˜Cδ[3m], it follows that Ah ∩ Aδ is nonempty.
Therefore p is of 3m-torsion, and Ah = Aδ as claimed.

Explicit computation of the equianharmonic torsion parameters. Our
method to compute the higher order Halphen cubics geometrically is based on the
following remark.

Remark 1.6 The plane cubic curve C = x3 + y3 − z3 is a j-invariant 0 curve, and
each of the three lines L1∗∗∗ in the dual Hesse conﬁguration going through the point
v1 = (0, 1, 0) is a ﬂex line for C (i.e., tangent to C at a ﬂex point). For brevity, in
this section we denote these lines simply

L1 = −ε2(z − x), L0 = εz − x, L∞ = z − εx

(With respect to the equations L1∗∗∗ above, a product with adequate constant co-
eﬃcients was done so that L0 + L∞ = L1). Thus the linear series on C given by
the pencil of lines through v1 deﬁnes a morphism C → Ev1 with triple ramiﬁcation
above the points corresponding to the directions of the Lu, which form exactly the
set Mv1; and the equianharmonic torsion parameters (with respect to Mv1) can be
computed as the projections to Ev1 of the torsion points on C.

Once the n-torsion points on C are known, their projections to Ev1 (which means
their (x, z) coordinates) are the equianharmonic n-torsion parameters. The torsion
points can be found in principle solving algebraic equations involving so-called di-
vision polynomials [12], so the method works uniformly for all n. In this section
we will determine the equianharmonic 6-torsion parameters, where we can ﬁnd the
required 6-torsion points using a more geometric method. We then produce the 44
Halphen cubics of order 2. These include the 8 order 1 cubics, so we have 36 still to
ﬁnd.

Lemma 1.7 The 6-torsion points of C are obtained by adding (using the group law
on C) each of the nine points

(1, 0, 1), (1, 0, ε), (1, 0, ε2 ), (1, −1, 0), (1, −ε, 0), (1, −ε2 , 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 1, ε), (0, 1, ε2 )

to each of the four points

(1, 0, 1), (1, −b, −1), (1, −εb, −1), (1, −ε2 b, −1)

where b3 − 2 = 0.

Proof. The 6-torsion points can be obtained by adding 3-torsion points and 2-torsion
points. The 3-torsion points are the ﬂex points, which as noted above, are the nine
points given. As for the 2-torsion points, note ﬁrst that (1, 0, 1) is a ﬂex. Regarding
it as the identity for the group law on C, the 2-torsion points on C are the lines
tangent to C which go through the identity (i.e., through (1, 0, 1)). One can check
that the required points are the four points given. Using the group law on C one
can now ﬁnd all 36 of the 6-torsion points.
(cid:3)

Projections from 6-torsion points. Three of the 6-torsion points are the ram-
iﬁcation points of the projection, and 6 of them correspond to the n = 3 case. The
other 27 come from taking a line through a 2-torsion point and one of the nine
3-torsion points. One then ﬁnds the line through each of these 27 points and the
point v1. This gives 9 lines through v1:

x − (1/2)b2z,
x − bz,
x + z,

x − εbz,
x + εz,

x − (1/2)εb2z,

x − (1/2)ε2b2z

x − ε2bz

x + ε2z

The ramiﬁcation points map to the lines Li, and the lines above (up to product with
a constant, in the same order) can be written as:

(bε − 1)L0 − ε(bε2 − 1)L∞,
(bε2 − 1)L0 − ε2(bε − 1)L∞,

(b − 1)L0 − ε(bε − 1)L∞,
(b − 1)L0 − ε2(bε2 − 1)L∞,

(bε2 − 1)L0 − ε(b − 1)L∞
(bε − 1)L0 − ε2(b − 1)L∞

L0 − L∞,

2L0 + L∞,

L0 + 2L∞

Now the equianharmonic torsion parameters P1[6] \ P1[3] can be obtained as the
ratios between the coeﬃcients of L∞ and L0 in the previous list. In the same order
again:

As an aside we note that 3 of them are deﬁned over Q; they form one orbit under
the action of S3 generated by t 7→ 1 − t and t 7→ t−1. The remaining 6 form
another orbit, which consists of the roots of the irreducible invariant polynomial
P (x) = x6 − 3x5 + 5x3 − 3x + 1 = (x2 − x − 1)3 + 2, with the property that
Q[τ ] = Q[ε, b] is the splitting ﬁeld of x3 + 2 (see [6, page 59]).

As explained in the proof of Theorem 1.5, the singular points of the conﬁguration
Hm are exactly the 3m-torsion points on each of its components, translated by one
(arbitrary) base point of the pencil to which it belongs. In the case of H2, these
6-torsion points can be computed for each Cts by the same method above; we leave
the details to the interested reader.

2 The linear series of the Roulleau-Urz´ua map

Recall now the construction by Roulleau and Urz´ua of their planar conﬁguration of
cubics (which we will eventually show to be equal to the Halphen cubics of order
m). Let as before T = C/Z[ζ], where ζ = e2πi/6, be the equianharmonic elliptic
curve, and let pi = i
3 ζ for 0 6 i 6 2 be the 3 ﬁxed points of multiplication by
ζ 2. Let A be the abelian surface A = T × T , and denote σ : A → A the induced
automorphism deﬁned by (x, y) 7→ (ζ 2x, ζ 2y), which has 9 ﬁxed points, namely

3 + i

pij = ( i

3 + i

3 ζ, j

3 + j

3 ζ)

(0 6 i, j 6 2),

so that pij = (pi, pj).

Divisors of particular importance on A are V = 0 × T , H = T × 0, the diagonal
∆ and the graph Γ of the complex multiplication by ζ. In fact, these curves span
the N´eron-Severi group of A. Translating V, H, ∆, Γ by the ﬁxed points pij gives
twelve curves: each of the ﬁxed points is on four of the translates and each translate
contains 3 of the ﬁxed points, as suggested in Figure 1. Of the diagonal lines,
only ∆ and Γ can be shown properly as going through three of the points pij, but
the line through points p01 and p10 also goes through point p22, and in general if
(i1, j1) + (i2, j2) + (i3, j3) add up as vectors in Z2
3 to (0, 0), then the points pi1j1, pi2j2
and pi3j3, are collinear. Moreover, the points of intersection actually occur only at
the points pij, contrary to how it might look in the drawing.

Figure 1: The curves V, H, ∆, Γ ⊂ A and their translates by the ﬁxed points pij

Now let B → A be the blow up at the nine points pij. Since these are ﬁxed
points for σ, the automorphism lifts to B. By a slight abuse of notation, we denote
the lift of σ to B again by σ (and we denote the total transforms of V, H, ∆, Γ to

13

B with the same letters). Thus we have the quotient B → X = B/ hσi. Moreover,
because σ acts diagonally on A, σ ﬁxes tangent directions at p00 (and hence also at
each ﬁxed point pij), so the ﬁxed points for σ acting on B are exactly the points of
the exceptional curves for the nine points pij. Thus the ramiﬁcation locus for the
quotient map B → X is the union of these nine exceptional curves.

Roulleau and Urz´ua show in [14] that X is smooth and rational, and that un-
der the quotient B → X the images of the 12 curves obtained from V, H, ∆, Γ by
translation are disjoint (−1)-curves whose contraction gives a birational morphism
X → P2, representing X as the blow-up of P2 at the twelve points of the dual Hesse
conﬁguration. So we have a diagram

B = Bl9(A) −→ A = T × T

ϕ
ց

y

X = Bl12(P2) −→ P2

where the vertical map is of degree 3 and its branch locus is the union of the nine
exceptional curves for the upper horizontal map, whose images are the 9 harmonic
polar lines of the dual Hesse conﬁguration.

In this section we describe the induced map ϕ : B → P2 in terms of linear
series. Then, using the action of the theta group, we determine the coordinates of
the images of the 12 translates of V, H, ∆, Γ, which will justify the choice of indices
v, h, δ, γ in the previous section.

Theorem 2.1

a) The morphism ϕ : B → P2 is the map ϕL deﬁned by the complete linear series

|L| associated with the line bundle

L = V + H + ∆ + Γ − E

where E is the sum of the nine exceptional divisors Eij of the blow-up B → A.

b) Consider the translates Vi = V + (pi, 0) = V + pi0. Then there are elliptic

curves N01, N02, N12 ⊂ A such that the divisors

D0 := V1 + V2 + N12
D1 := V0 + V2 + N02
D2 := V0 + V1 + N01

belong to the linear series |L|. If we deﬁne the map ϕL : B → P2 by suitably
scaled sections corresponding to the divisors D0, D1, D2, then the images of the
12 translates of V, H, ∆, Γ are the 12 Hesse dual points vu, hu, δu, γu.

The proof of Theorem 2.1 is split into several intermediate steps ﬁlling the rest

of the present section. We start by showing:

Proposition 2.2 The morphism ϕ : B → P2 is the map deﬁned by the complete
linear series

|V + H + ∆ + Γ − E|

where E is as above.

14

Proof. With respect to the blow up B → A, the proper transforms of the curves
V, H, ∆, Γ are V ′ = V − E02 − E00 − E01, H ′ = H − E20 − E00 − E10, ∆′ =
∆ − E22 − E00 − E11 and Γ′ = Γ − E21 − E00 − E12, where Eij is the exceptional curve
for the blow up of pij. These curves are mutually disjoint and meet E00 transversely.
Since V ′, H ′, ∆′ and Γ′ are preserved curvewise by σ and E00 is ﬁxed pointwise, the
images V ′′, H ′′, ∆′′ and Γ′′ of V ′, H ′, ∆′ and Γ′ under the quotient B → X are
00 of E00 transversely. Since V ′′, H ′′, ∆′′ and Γ′′ are
disjoint and meet the image E′
exceptional curves which map to points under X → P2, E′
00 maps to a smooth plane
00 + V ′′ + H ′′ + ∆′′ + Γ′′)2 =
rational curve C, hence of self-intersection C 2 = (E′
(E′
00)2, and
has triple ramiﬁcation along E00, so ϕ∗(E′
00)2,
so (E′

00)2 + 4(2) + 4(−1). But B → X is a triple cover, so (ϕ∗(E′

00) = 3E00. Thus −9 = (3E00)2 = 3(E′

00)2 = −3 and C 2 = 1, hence C is a line.

00))2 = 3(E′

The pullback of C to B is V ′ + H ′ + ∆′ + Γ′ + 3E′

5 = V + H + ∆ + Γ − E, which
we denote by L. I.e., the map ϕ is deﬁned by a 3 dimensional subspace of H 0(B, L),
and the argument so far shows that L = V + H + ∆ + Γ − E. We will now prove that
h0(B, L) = 3, which then implies that ϕ is deﬁned by the complete linear series |L|.
First, we have (V + H + ∆ + Γ)2 = 12, and therefore by Riemann-Roch on A
we get h0(A, V + H + ∆ + Γ) = 6. It is therefore enough to ﬁnd three ﬁxed points
q1, q2, q3 of σ that impose independent conditions on |V + H + ∆ + Γ|, i.e., such
that there is a divisor in the linear series |V + H + ∆ + Γ| passing through q1 and
q2, but not through q3 (this suﬃces since the divisor V + H + ∆ + Γ is very ample
by [4, Theorem 2.3]). Consider to this end the point x = ( 1
3 , 0) on A. Lemma 2.3
implies that there is a point z ∈ A such that the divisor t∗
z(∆ + Γ) belongs
to the linear series |V + H + ∆ + Γ|. Let q1 and q2 be any two of the three ﬁxed
points lying on H. Clearly none of the nine ﬁxed points lies on t∗
xV , and there can
be at most ﬁve of them on t∗
z(∆ + Γ). Therefore there exists a ﬁxed point q3 that
lies neither on H nor on t∗
z(∆ + Γ). The triple of points q1, q2, q3 thus satisﬁes the
required condition.
(cid:3)

Lemma 2.3 For every pair of points x, y ∈ A there exists a unique point z ∈ A
such that

t∗

z(∆ + Γ) ≡lin V + H + ∆ + Γ

The analogous statement holds for any permutation of the curves V, H, ∆, Γ.

Proof. Consider the homomorphism of groups

Φ : A × A × A → Pic0(A)
xV + t∗

(x, y, z) 7→ t∗

yH + t∗

z(∆ + Γ) − (V + H + ∆ + Γ)

For every pair (x, y) ∈ A × A, the map Φ(x, y, ·) is a translate of the canonical
homomorphism A → Pic0(A), z 7→ t∗
z(∆ + Γ) − (∆ + Γ), associated with the line
bundle ∆ + Γ. Since this line bundle is of self-intersection 2, it gives a principal
polarization and therefore its canonical homomorphism is in fact an isomorphism
(see [5, Prop. 2.4.9]) and thus the intersection ker Φ ∩ ({(x, y)} × A) consists of
exactly one point.
(cid:3)

Proposition 2.4 The map ψ that assigns to given points x, y ∈ A the point z as in
the preceding lemma is given by

ψ : A × A → A

((x1, x2), (y1, y2)) 7→(cid:0) − 2x1 − (1 + ζ)y2, −(1 + ζ)x1 − 2y2(cid:1)

15

Remark 2.5 For the special case where x and y are among the nine ﬁxed points
of σ, we get with a calculation

In other words, we have

ψ(pij, pkl) = pil

t∗
pij V + t∗

pklH + t∗

pil(∆ + Γ) ≡lin V + H + ∆ + Γ

Proof of the proposition. For a line bundle M on A denote as usual by φM the
canonical homomorphism A → Pic0(A), x 7→ t∗
xM − M . The point z = ψ(x, y) is
characterized by the condition t∗
z(∆ + Γ) ≡lin V + H + ∆ + Γ, which is
equivalent to φV (x) + φH(y) + φ∆+Γ(z) = 0. This in turn implies that

yH + t∗

xV + t∗

ψ(x, y) = φ−1

∆+Γ(cid:16) − φV (x) − φH(y)(cid:17)

(5)

The issue therefore is to explicitly determine the canonical maps. As V + H gives a
principal polarization, φV +H is an isomorphism, and hence we can use its inverse to
identify Pic0(A) with A. In that sense, we will, by slight abuse of notation, denote
φ−1
V +H−→ A = T × T again by φM .

φM−→ Pic0(A)

the composed homomorphism T × T = A
In this setup, φV and φH are given by the matrices

(cid:16)1 0
0 0(cid:17) and (cid:16)0 0
0 1(cid:17)

respectively. We now determine the map φ∆+Γ in these terms. Consider to this end
the isomorphism g : T × T → T × T , (x, y) 7→ (x, y − x). The analytic representation
of g and its dual map ˆg are

Lemma 2.6 The divisor H + ∆ + Γ − V is numerically equivalent to an elliptic
curve N . We have

φN =

!

16

Proof. The line bundle H + ∆ + Γ − V has self-intersection 0 and it has positive
intersection with the ample bundle ∆ + Γ. This implies that its numerical class
belongs to a sum of numerically equivalent elliptic curves. As its intersection with
H is 1, it is in fact the class of a single elliptic curve. The second assertion follows
from the equation

φN = φH + φ∆ + φΓ − φV

upon using the explicit matrix representations of the maps that were worked out
above.
(cid:3)

The following statement can be useful in understanding the map B → P2, or in

the construction of a basis of H 0(B, L).

Lemma 2.7 Consider the line bundle M = V + H + ∆ + Γ on A. All nine ﬁxed
points of the automorphism σ = (ζ 2, ζ 2) are contained in the kernel K(M ) of φM .
In other words, if D ∈ |M |, then

t∗
xD ∈ |M |

for every x in Fix(σ)

Proof. From the equation φM = φV + φH + φ∆ + φΓ we get

φM =

−1 − ζ

and one checks that φM · pij is contained in (Z + Zζ) × (Z + Zζ) for every i and j. (cid:3)

Preimages of lines. As we know, the three translates Vi = V + pi0 map to points
in P2. We would like to see the curves on A which correspond to the lines ℓij
through any two of those points. As the preimage of ℓij contains Vi and Vj, we have
V + H + ∆ + Γ = Vi + Vj + Nij, where the residual curve Nij is an elliptic curve (by
Lemma 2.6). Its intersection numbers with the generators are

Nij · V = 3, Nij · H = 1, Nij · ∆ = 1, Nij · Γ = 1

On the other hand, every elliptic curve on A that passes through the origin arises
as the image of a homomorphism T → A, x 7→ (ax + bζx, cx + dζx) for suitable
integers a, b, c, d (see [10]). Using the method from [3, Sect. 4.2] one ﬁnds that
the elliptic curve N corresponding to (a, b, c, d) = (1, 1, 0, 1), i.e, the image of the
map x 7→ (x + ζx, ζx) has the same intersection numbers as Nij and is therefore
numerically equivalent to Nij. So Nij can be obtained from N by a translation –
and we determine now explicitly such a translation. The idea is this: We know that
the divisor Vi + Vj + Nij passes through all 9 points pij. Since Vi and Vj cover 6 of
them, Nij must pass through the remaining 3. Now, a computation shows that the
intersection points of N and V0 are p00, p01, p02. This implies that N = N12. The
other cases are obtained via translation by suitable ﬁxed points – altogether we have

N12 = N
N02 = N + p10 = t∗
N01 = N + p20 = t∗

−p10N = t∗
−p20N = t∗

The images of the contracted translates. We know that the 12 translates of
V, H, ∆, Γ by ﬁxed-points of σ map to points in P2. We will use the notation

Vi = V + pi0, Hi = H + p0i, ∆i = ∆ + pi,2i, Γi = Γ + pii

for these translates (where 0 6 i 6 2) and we will determine the coordinates of their
image points. Consider in the linear series |L| the divisors

D0 := V1 + V2 + N12

We choose sections si ∈ H 0(A, M ) deﬁning them and use these to deﬁne the map
φL : B → P2. Clearly the vertical curves V0, V1, V2 then map to the points

v0 = (1 : 0 : 0),

v1 = (0 : 1 : 0),

v∞ = (0 : 0 : 1)

(6)

respectively. We will now use the projective representation K(M ) → PGL(H 0(A, M ))
(see [5, Chap. 6]) in order to determine the coordinates of the images of the remain-
ing nine curves Hi, ∆i, Γi. By Lemma 2.7 we have Fix(ζ 2) ⊂ K(M ), and we know
that translation by ﬁxed points leaves the condition of vanishing in these points
invariant. Therefore the representation restricts to Fix(ζ 2) → PGL(H 0(B, L)). In
other words, each of the nine ﬁxed points gives rise to a projective transformation
of P2. Let Mij denote the projective transformation corresponding to pij. As the
translation tp10 cycles the vertical translates, V0 → V1 → V2 → V0, we know that
M10 must be of the form

M10 =  0

λ1
0

0

0
λ2

λ3

0!

with non-zero entries λi. Note now that scaling the sections si corresponds to a
diagonal transformation on P2. We can therefore scale the si (which leaves the
coordinates in (6) invariant) in such a way that in fact λ1 = λ2 = λ3 = 1, so that

M10 = 0 0 1
0 1 0!

1 0 0

The key is now the fact that the horizontal curves H0, H1, H2 are ﬁxed under p10.
Their coordinate vectors must therefore be eigenvectors of M10. These are

h0 = (1 : 1 : 1),

h1 = (1 : ε : ε2),

h∞ = (1 : ε2 : ε)

(7)

where ε denotes a primitive third root of unity. (After possibly rechoosing the origin
in A they are in this order.)

Consider now the translation tp01. It ﬁxes V0, V1, V2 and therefore M01 is of the

form

M01 = µ1

0

0

0
µ2
0

with non-zero entries µi. Since tp01 maps H0 to H1, we have in fact

M01 = 1 0

0 0 ε2!

0 ε

after scaling M01 if necessary. (Here we use that the images of the Hi are given
by the coordinates, and the order, in (7).) With this information at hand, we can
now also determine the coordinates of the images of the ∆i and Γi. First, the
diagonal translates ∆i are ﬁxed under tp11, and therefore their images are given by
the eigenvectors of the matrix

18

M11 = M10 · M01 = 0

ε

0 ε2

Thus we get the points

δ0 = (ε : 1 : 1),

δ1 = (1 : ε : 1),

δ∞ = (1 : 1 : ε)

(8)

Here the ﬁrst of these points is the image of ∆0, because it is this point among
the three which is collinear with the images of V0 and H0. And ﬁnally, the graph
translates Γi are ﬁxed under tp12, which leads us to the matrix

M12 = M 2

01 · M10 =  0

ε2

0 1

ε 0!

and the coordinates

γ0 = (ε2 : 1 : 1),

γ1 = (1 : ε2 : 1),

γ∞ = (1 : 1 : ε2)

(9)

The ﬁrst of these points is the image of Γ0 (again by collinearity with V0 and H0).
Summing up, we found that in the chosen basis of H 0(L) the image points of the
12 translates are given by (6), (7), (8) and (9), and these coincide with the points
in the dual Hesse conﬁguration in standard form.

The Roulleau-Urz´ua conﬁguration. Let n = 3m for some integer m ≥ 1.
Using the group of n-torsion points on A, we can translate the curves V, H, ∆ and Γ
to obtain an a priori count of 4n4 curves, 4 each at each of the n4 n-torsion points.
Since each of the divisors V, H, ∆ and Γ contain n2 of the torsion points, and thus
are their own images under translation by this subgroup, there are only actually
4n4/n2 = 4n2 curves. The images under ϕL : B → P2 of the proper transforms
under B → A of these curves form the Roulleau-Urz´ua conﬁguration. We can now
prove that these are exactly the Halphen cubics of order m.

Proof of Theorem 2. The n-torsion subgroup contains the order 9 subgroup con-
sisting of the 9 points ﬁxed with respect to the action of σ on A. Each of the
12 curves through these 9 points (these are the curves shown in Figure 1) map to
points of P2, and we found these points above. The orbits under applications of σ
among the remaining 4(n2 − 3) curves consist of 3 curves each. Thus under ϕL these
curves map 3 to 1 to cubic curves, and the images of the 4(n2 − 3) curves in A are
4(n2 − 3)/3 = 4(3m2 − 1) cubic curves in P2.

The curves in the pencils (Hu), (∆u) and (Γu) meet V0, V1, V2, so their images
pass through the points v0, v1, v∞. Similarly, the curves in the pencils (Vu), (∆u)
and (Γu) meet H0, H1, H2, so their images pass through the points h0, h1, h∞, and
so on. All together, the images of curves in (Vu) pass through all 9 points in Λv, so
they are members of Cv, and similarly the pencils (Hu), (∆u) and (Γu) map to the
pencils Ch, Cδ and Cγ.

19

Note that n2 − 3 curves on A come from each of the 4 pencils. The ones which
meet V come from the pencils (Hu), (∆u) and (Γu), with one from each pencil
meeting V at each of the n2 − 3 n-torsion points on V not ﬁxed by σ. Now, V
maps to the point v0 ∈ P2, and the triples of curves at each torsion point of V thus
map to curves with the same tangent direction at v0 = (1 : 0 : 0). The tangent
directions are the (n2 − 3)/3 inﬁnitely near images in X of the n-torsion points on
V not ﬁxed by σ. We also get 3 tangent directions corresponding to the inﬁnitely
near images of the 3 n-torsion points on V ﬁxed by σ; but these we know to be the
tangent directions of the 3 lines of the dual Hesse conﬁguration that pass through
v0, which are the images of the 3 exceptional divisors E0i above the ﬁxed points
on V . So the restriction of the quotient map B → X to V is a degree 3 morphism
V → Ev0 triply ramiﬁed above the directions of the dual Hesse lines, and therefore
the tangent directions to the Roulleau-Urza cubics in Ch, Cδ and Cγ are exactly the
points in Ev0 [3m]. So, they are indeed the Halphen cubics of order m in the pencils
Ch, Cδ and Cγ.

The same argument applied to the restriction of B → X to H proves that the
Roulleau-Urz´ua cubics in the remaining pencil Cv are the Halphen cubics as well. (cid:3)
