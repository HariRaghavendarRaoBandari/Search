AND ˆO DILATIONS AND INEQUALITIES ON NONCOMMUTATIVE VARIETIES

GELU POPESCU

Abstract. Andˆo proved a dilation result that implies his celebrated inequality which says that if T1
and T2 are commuting contractions on a Hilbert space, then for any polynomial p in two variables,

kp(T1, T2)k ≤ kpkD2 ,

where D2 is the bidisk in C2. The main goal of the present paper is to ﬁnd analogues of Andˆo’s
results for the elements of the bi-ball Pn1 ,n2 which consists of all pairs (X, Y) of row contractions
X := (X1, . . . , Xn1 ) and Y := (Y1, . . . , Yn2 ) which commute, i.e. each entry of X commutes with each
entry of Y. The results are obtained in a more general setting, namely, when X and Y belong to
noncommutative varieties V1 and V2 determined by row contractions subject to constraints such as

q(X1, . . . , Xn1 ) = 0

and r(Y1, . . . , Yn2 ) = 0,

q ∈ P, r ∈ R,

respectively, where P and R are sets of noncommutative polynomials. We obtain dilation results which
simultaneously generalize Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem for contractions, Andˆo’s dilation theorem for com-
muting contractions, Sz.-Nagy–Foia¸s commutant lifting theorem, and Schur’s representation for the unit
ball of H∞, in the framework of noncommutative varieties and Poisson kernels on Fock spaces. This
leads to one of the main results of the paper, an Andˆo type inequality on noncommutative varieties,
which, in the particular case when n1 = n2 = 1 and T1 and T2 are commuting contractive matrices with
spectrum in the open unit disk D := {z ∈ C :

|z| < 1}, takes the form

kp(T1, T2)k ≤ min (cid:8)kp(B1 ⊗ ICd1 , ϕ1(B1))k, kp(ϕ2(B2), B2 ⊗ ICd2 )k(cid:9) ,

where (B1 ⊗ ICd1 , ϕ1(B1)) and (ϕ2(B2), B2 ⊗ ICd2 ) are analytic dilations of (T1, T2) while B1 and
B2 are the universal models associated with T1 and T2, respectively. In this setting, the inequality is
sharper than Andˆo’s inequality and Agler-McCarthy’s inequality. We obtain more general inequalities
for arbitrary commuting contractive matrices and improve Andˆo’s inequality for commuting contractions
when at least one of them is of class C0.

We prove that there is a universal model (S ⊗ Iℓ2 , ϕ(S)), where S is the unilateral shift and ϕ(S) is

an isometric analytic Toeplitz operator on H 2(D) ⊗ ℓ2, such that

k[prs(T1, T2)]kk ≤ k[prs(S ⊗ Iℓ2 , ϕ(S))]kk,

for any commuting contractions T1 and T2 on Hilbert spaces, any k × k matrix [prs]k of polynomials in
C[z, w], and any k ∈ N. Analogues of this result for the bi-ball Pn1 ,n2 and for a class of noncommutative
varieties are also considered.

Introduction

Two of the most important results in operator theory are von Neumann’s inequality [28] and Andˆo’s
generalization [2] to two commuting contractions on a Hilbert space (see also [26], [5], [6], and [7]). Andˆo’s
inequality is essentially equivalent (see [11] and [12]) to the Sz.-Nagy–Foia¸s commutant lifting theorem
[25] and states that if T1 and T2 are commuting contractions on a Hilbert space, then for any polynomial
p in two variables,

kp(T1, T2)k ≤ kpkD2 ,

where D2 is the bidisk in C2. Varopoulus [27] found a counterexample showing that the inequality does
not extend to three mutually commuting contractions. For a nice survey and further generalizations of
these inequalities we refer to Pisier’s book [13].

GELU POPESCU

In a remarkable paper [1], Agler and McCarthy improved Andˆo’s inequality in the case of contractive

matrices with no eigenvalues of modulus 1. They showed that

kp(T1, T2)k ≤ kpkV ,

where V is some distinguished variety in the bidisc D2 depending on T1 and T2.

One of the main results of our paper improves the above-mentioned inequalities for commuting con-
tractive matrices T1 and T2 with spectrum in the open unit disk D. The idea is the following. Each
matrix Ti lives in an operator-valued variety Vi, which is uniquely determined by its minimal polynomial,
and admits a universal model Bi. Using noncommutative Poisson transforms [18], we show that the pair
(T1, T2) admits analytic dilations (B1 ⊗ ICd1 , ϕ1(B1)) and (ϕ2(B2), B2 ⊗ ICd2 ) which encode the algebraic
and geometric structure of (T1, T2). This leads to the inequality

k[prs(T1, T2)]kk ≤ min {k[prs(B1 ⊗ ICd1 , ϕ1(B1))]kk, k[prs(ϕ2(B2), B2 ⊗ ICd2 )]kk}

for any k × k matrix [prs]k, k ∈ N, of polynomials in C[z, w], which is sharper than Andˆo’s inequality and
Agler-McCarthy’s inequality (see the remarks and examples following Theorem 3.3). In fact, we obtain a
more general result for arbitrary commuting contractive matrices (see Theorem 3.11). We also improve
Andˆo’s inequality for commuting contractions when at least one of them is of class C0 (see Theorem 3.1
and Remark 3.2).

On the other hand, we prove that there is a universal model (S ⊗ Iℓ2 , ϕ(S)), where S is the unilateral
shift on the Hardy space H 2(D) and ϕ(S) is an isometric analytic Toeplitz operator on H 2(D) ⊗ ℓ2, such
that

k[prs(T1, T2)]kk ≤ k[prs(S ⊗ Iℓ2 , ϕ(S))]kk,

for any commuting contractions T1 and T2 on Hilbert spaces, any k × k matrix [prs]k of polynomials in
C[z, w] and any k ∈ N. The closed non-self-adjoint algebra Au(D2) generated by S ⊗ Iℓ2 , ϕ(S) and the
identity can be seen as the universal operator algebra for two commuting contractions. All these results
are presented in Section 3.

The main goal of our paper is to obtain Andˆo dilations and inequalities on noncommutative varieties

in the more general setting of bi-balls. To present these results we need some notation and deﬁnitions.

Throughout this paper, B(H) stands for the algebra of all bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space
H. We denote by B(H)n1 ×c B(H)n2 , where n1, n2 ∈ N := {1, 2, . . .}, the set of all pairs (X, Y) in
B(H)n1 × B(H)n2 with the property that the entries of X := (X1, . . . , Xn1 ) are commuting with the
entries of Y := (Y1, . . . , Yn2). Let n := (n1, n2) and deﬁne the open bi-ball

Pn(H) := [B(H)n1 ]1 ×c [B(H)n2 ]1,

where

[B(H)n]1 := {(X1, . . . , Xn) ∈ B(H)n : kX1X∗1 + · · · + XnX∗nk < 1}, n ∈ N.

The closure of Pn(H) in the operator norm topology is denoted by P−n (H). For simplicity, throughout
this paper, [X1, . . . , Xn] denotes either the n-tuple (X1, . . . , Xn) ∈ B(H)n or the operator row matrix
[X1 · · · Xn] acting from H(n), the direct sum of n copies of the Hilbert space H, to H.

Let Hn be an n-dimensional complex Hilbert space with orthonormal basis e1, . . . , en, where n ∈ N.

We consider the full Fock space of Hn deﬁned by

F 2(Hn) := C1 ⊕Mk≥1

H⊗k
n ,

where H⊗k
Si (resp. Ri), i = 1, . . . , n, acting on F 2(Hn) by setting

n is the (Hilbert) tensor product of k copies of Hn. Deﬁne the left (resp. right) creation operators

Siϕ := ei ⊗ ϕ, ϕ ∈ F 2(Hn),

(resp. Riϕ := ϕ⊗ei). The universal models asociated with the unit ball [B(H)n]1 are S := [S1, . . . , Sn] and
R := [R1, . . . , Rn]. The noncommutative disc algebra An (resp. Rn) is the norm closed non-self-adjoint
algebra generated by the left (resp. right) creation operators and the identity. The noncommutative
analytic Toeplitz algebra F ∞n (resp. R∞n ) is the weakly closed version of An (resp. Rn). These algebras
were introduced in [15], [16] in connection with a noncommutative von Neumann type inequality.

AND ˆO DILATIONS AND INEQUALITIES ON NONCOMMUTATIVE VARIETIES

3

Let J be a WOT-closed two-sided ideal of F ∞n such that J 6= F ∞n , and deﬁne the noncommutative

variety VJ (H) to be the set of all pure row contractions T := [T1, . . . , Tn], Ti ∈ B(H), such that

f (T1, . . . , Tn) = 0

for any

f ∈ J,

where f (T1, . . . , Tn) is deﬁned according to the F ∞n -functional calculus (see [16]). We proved in [20]
that there are some universal models B := [B1, . . . , Bn] and W := [W1, . . . , Wn] associated with the
noncommutative variety VJ , which are compressions of the creation operators to a certain joint co-
invariant subspace uniquely determined by J. The noncommutative Hardy algebra R∞n (VJ ) is the weakly
closed non-self-adjoint algebra generated by W1, . . . , Wn and the identity.

In Section 1, we obtain dilation results (Theorem 1.5 and Theorem 1.6), for the elements of noncom-
mutative varieties VJ , which are simultaneous multi-variable generalizations of Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem
for contractions [26], Andˆo’s dilation theorem for commuting contractions [2], Sz.-Nagy–Foia¸s commu-
tant lifting theorem [26], and of Schur’s representation for the unit ball of H∞ [24], in the framework
of noncommutative Poisson kernels associated with VJ . As consequences, we provide a Schur type rep-
resentation for the noncommutative Hardy algebra R∞n (VJ ) (see Theorem 1.9) and a new proof for the
commutant lifting theorem for pure row contractions in noncommutative varieties (see [14], [20]).

In Section 2, using the results from Section 1, we prove that any pair (T1, T2) in the noncommutative

variety

has analytic dilations

P−J1,J2,n(H) :=(cid:8)(T1, T2) ∈ P−n (H) : T1 ∈ VJ1(H), T2 ∈ VJ2(H)(cid:9) ,

(B1 ⊗ Iℓ2 , ϕ1(W1)) and (ϕ2(W2), B2 ⊗ Iℓ2 )

where ϕ1(W1) and ϕ2(W2) are some contractive multi-analytic operators with respect to the universal
models B1 and B2 of the varieties VJ1 and VJ2, respectively. As a consequence, we show that the
inequality

k[prs(T1, T2)]kk ≤ min {k[prs(B1 ⊗ Iℓ2 , ϕ1(W1))]kk, k[prs(ϕ2(W2), B2 ⊗ Iℓ2 )]kk}

prs ∈ C hX, Yi

holds for any k ∈ N, where C hX, Yi is the complex algebra of all polynomials in noncommutative
indeterminates X1, . . . , Xn1 and Y1, . . . , Yn2 .

On the other hand, we prove that the bi-ball P−n (H) has a universal model

(S1 ⊗ Iℓ2 , . . . Sn1 ⊗ Iℓ2 , ψ1(R), . . . , ψn2(R)),

where ψ(R) = (ψ1(R), . . . , ψn2 (R) is some contractive multi-analytic operator with respect to the uni-
versal model S = [S1, . . . , Sn1], and R = [R1, . . . , Rn1]. More precisely, we show that

k[prs(T1, T2)]kk ≤ k[prs(S ⊗ Iℓ2 , ψ(R))]kk,

prs ∈ C hX, Yi ,

for any (T1, T2) ∈ P−n (H) and any k ∈ N. The closed non-self-adjoint algebra A(Pn) generated by
S1 ⊗ Iℓ2 , . . . , Sn1 ⊗ Iℓ2 , ψ1(R), . . . , ψn2 (R) and the identity can be seen as the universal operator algebra
of the bi-ball P−n . A similar result is provided for a class of noncommutative varieties in P−n .

We remark that when when J = {0}, the variety V{0} coincides with the set of all pure row contractions
and the universal models are S = [S1, . . . , Sn] and R := [R1, . . . , Rn]. On the other hand, in the particular
case when Jc is the ideal generated by the polynomials SiSj − SjSi, i, j = 1, . . . , n, the universal model
of VJc consists of the creation operators on the symmetric Fock space F 2
s . Arveson showed in [4] that F 2
s
can be identiﬁed with a subspace space H2 of analytic functions in Bn, namely, the reproducing kernel
Hilbert space with reproducing kernel Kn : Bn × Bn → C deﬁned by

Kn(z, w) :=

1

1 − hz, wiCn

,

z, w ∈ Bn.

The algebra R∞n (VJc) can be identiﬁed with the algebra of all multipliers of H2. Under this identiﬁcation
the creation operators become the multiplication operators Mz1, . . . , Mzn by the coordinate functions
z1, . . . , zn of Cn. All the results of this paper, concerning Andˆo dilations and inequalities, apply to these
two important particular settings.

1. Andˆo type dilations on noncommutative varieties

In this section, we obtain dilation results which simultaneously generalize Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem
for contractions, Andˆo’s dilation theorem for commuting contractions, Sz.-Nagy–Foia¸s commutant lifting
theorem, and Schur’s representation for the unit ball of H∞, in the framework of noncommutative varieties
and Poisson kernels on Fock spaces.

Let F+

n be the unital free semigroup on n generators g1, . . . , gn and the identity g0. The length of
α ∈ F+
n is deﬁned by |α| := 0 if α = g0 and |α| := k if α = gi1 · · · gik , where i1, . . . , ik ∈ {1, . . . , n}. If
(X1, . . . , Xn) ∈ B(H)n, where B(H) is the algebra of all bounded linear operators on the Hilbert space H,
we set Xα := Xi1 · · · Xik and Xg0 := IH. Let Hn be a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space with orthonormal
basis e1, . . . , en. We denote eα := ei1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ eik and eg0 := 1. Note that {eα}α∈F+
is an orthonormal
basis for the full Fock space F 2(Hn).

n

We recall ([15], [16], [17]) a few facts concerning multi-analytic operators on Fock spaces. We say that
a bounded linear operator M acting from F 2(Hn) ⊗ K to F 2(Hn) ⊗ K′ is multi-analytic with respect to
the universal model S := [S1, . . . , Sn] if

M (Si ⊗ IK) = (Si ⊗ IK′ )M for any i = 1, . . . , n.

We can associate with M a unique formal Fourier expansionPα∈F+
We know thatPα∈F+

Rα ⊗ θ(α), where θ(α) ∈ B(K, K′).

n

where, for each r ∈ [0, 1), the series converges in the uniform norm. Moreover, the set of all multi-analytic
operators in B(F 2(Hn) ⊗ K, F 2(Hn) ⊗ K′) coincides with R∞n ¯⊗B(K, K′), the WOT-closed operator space
generated by the spatial tensor product. A multi-analytic operator is called inner if it is an isometry.
We remark that similar results are valid for multi-analytic operators with respect to the right creation
operators R1, . . . , Rn.

We need to recall from [18] a few facts about noncommutative Poisson transforms associated with row
contractions T := [T1, . . . , Tn], Ti ∈ B(H), i.e. T1T ∗1 + · · · + TnT ∗n ≤ I. For each 0 < r ≤ 1, deﬁne
the defect operator ∆T,r := (IK − r2T1T ∗1 − · · · − r2TnT ∗n)1/2 and the defect space DrT = ∆rTH. The
noncommutative Poisson kernel associated with T is the family of operators

KT,r : H → F 2(Hn) ⊗ DrT,

0 < r ≤ 1,

deﬁned by

KT,rh :=

∞Xk=0 X|α|=k

eα ⊗ r|α|∆T,rT ∗αh,

h ∈ H.

When r = 1, we denote ∆T := ∆T,1 and KT := KT,1. The operators KT,r are isometries if 0 < r < 1,
and, if r = 1,

K∗TKT = IK − SOT- lim

TαT ∗α.

k→∞ X|α|=k

Thus KT is an isometry if and only if T is a pure row contraction, i.e., SOT- lim

key property of the Poisson kernel is that

k→∞P|α|=k TαT ∗α = 0. A

KT,r(r|α|T ∗α) = (S∗α ⊗ I)KT,r

for any 0 < r ≤ 1, α ∈ F+
n .

We refer to [18] and [22] for more on noncommutative Poisson transforms on C∗-algebras generated by
isometries.

Let T1 = [T1,1, . . . , T1,n1] ∈ B(H)n1 and T′1 = [T ′1,1, . . . , T ′1,n1] ∈ B(H′)n1 be row contractions. Let

T2 := [T2,1, . . . , T2,n2], with T2,j : H′ → H, be a row contraction which intertwines T1 with T′1, i.e.

T2,jT ′1,i = T1,iT2,j

for any i ∈ {1, . . . , n1} and j ∈ {1, . . . , n2}. We denote by I(T1, T′1) the set of all contractive intertwining

Proof. First, we remark that D is a contraction, R1,1, . . . , R1,n1 are isometries with orthogonal ranges, and
j=1 rR1,j ⊗ D∗j is invertible and
¯⊗B (H′, H), where Rn1 is the noncommutative

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)Pn1
j=1 rR1,j ⊗ D∗j(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) ≤ r < 1. Consequently, the operator IF 2(Hn1 )⊗E −Pn1

ϕU ∗ (rR) = (ϕ1(rR), . . . , ϕn2(rR)) with ϕj(rR) ∈ Rn1
disc algebra generated by the right creation operators R1,1, . . . , R1,n1 and the identity. Note also that

On the other hand, since(cid:20)A∗ C∗

B∗ D∗(cid:21) is a unitary operator, standard calculations (see e.g. [20]) show

that

I − ϕU ∗ (rR)ϕU ∗ (rR)∗ = (1 − r2)C∗(I − rΓD∗)−1(I − rDΓ∗)−1C
I − ϕU ∗ (rR)∗ϕU ∗ (rR) = (1 − r2)B(I − rΓ∗D)−1(I − rD∗Γ)−1B∗.

The ﬁrst of the relations above shows that ϕU ∗ (rR) is a contraction for any r ∈ [0, 1). Consequently, since
¯⊗B (H′, H) has the Fourier representation (1.10),
ϕU ∗ (rR) = (ϕ1(rR), . . . , ϕn2 (rR)) and ϕj (rR) ∈ Rn1
one can see that ϕj(R) := SOT- limr→1 ϕj(rR) exists, ϕj(R) ∈ R∞n1

One of the main results of this section is the following intertwining dilation theorem for the elements

of I(T1, T′1), the set of all intertwining row contractions of T1 and T′1.

Theorem 1.5. Let T1 := (T1,1, . . . , T1,n1), T′1 := (T ′1,1, . . . , T ′1,n1), and T2 := (T2,1, . . . , T2,n2) be row
contractions such that T2 ∈ I(T1, T′1), and let S := [S1,1, . . . , S1,n1] and R := [R1,1, . . . , R1,n1 ] be the
creation operators on the full Fock space F 2(Hn1 ). If ϕU ∗ (R) = (ϕ1(R), . . . , ϕn2 (R)) is the multi-analytic

(cid:3)

We remark that, in Theorem 1.5, if there is U ∈ UKT satisfying condition (1.11), then ϕU ∗ (R) is
an isometry. Here is an example when condition (1.11) is satisﬁed. Another class of examples will be
considered later in Theorem 3.1.

Let f = (f1, . . . , fn1) be a free holomorphic automorphism of the unit ball [B(H)n1 ]1. Then T1 :=
(f1(S), . . . , fn1(S)) is a pure row contraction and the noncommutative Poisson kernel KT1 is a unitary
operator on F 2(Hn1 ) (see [21]). Let T2 := (ψ1(R), . . . ψn2 (R)), with ψj(R) ∈ B(F 2(Hn1 )), be any multi-
analytic operator which is an isometry. Applying Theorem 1.5, when U ∈ UKT1, we ﬁnd a multi-analytic
operator ϕU ∗ (R) = (ϕ1(R), . . . , ϕn2 (R)) such that

KT1 ψj(R)∗ = ϕj(R)∗KT1 ,

j ∈ {1, . . . , n2}

Since KT1 is unitary, ϕU ∗ (R) is an isometry and, consequently, condition (1.11) is satisﬁed.

It remains an open problem whether or not the set UKT always contains a unitary operator U such that

ϕU ∗ (R) is an isometry ?

In what follows we recall a few facts concerning constrained noncommutative Poisson kernels associated
with noncommutative varieties in the unit ball [B(H)n]1 (see [20]). Let J be a WOT-closed two-sided
ideal of F ∞n such that J 6= F ∞n , and deﬁne the noncommutative variety VJ (H) to be the set of all pure
row contractions T := [T1, . . . , Tn], Ti ∈ B(H), such that

f (T1, . . . , Tn) = 0

for any

f ∈ J,

where f (T1, . . . , Tn) is deﬁned using the F ∞n -functional calculus for row contractions (see [16]). We
proved in [20] that there is a universal model B := [B1, . . . , Bn] associated with VJ (H), such that
f (B1, . . . , Bn) = 0 for any f ∈ J. More precisely, we showed that an n-tuple T ∈ B(H)n of operators is
in the noncommutative variety VJ (H) if and only if [T1, . . . , Tn] is unitarily equivalent to the compression
[PN (B1 ⊗ ID)|N , . . . , PN (Bn ⊗ ID)|N ], where D is some Hilbert space and N is a co-invariant subspace
of B1 ⊗ ID, . . . , Bn ⊗ ID.

Let J be a WOT-closed two-sided ideal of F ∞n such that J 6= F ∞n , and deﬁne the subspaces of the full

Fock space F 2(Hn) by setting

MJ := J F 2(Hn) and NJ := F 2(Hn) ⊖ MJ .

We proved in [20] that NJ 6= {0} if and only if J 6= F ∞n . One can easily see that the subspace NJ is
invariant under S∗1 , . . . , S∗n and R∗1, . . . , R∗n. Deﬁne the constrained left (resp. right) creation operators by
setting

Bi := PNJ Si|NJ

and Wi := PNJ Ri|NJ ,

i = 1, . . . , n.

and call B := [B1, . . . , Bn] and W := [W1, . . . , Wn] universal models associated with the noncommutative
variety VJ .

12

GELU POPESCU

Let F ∞n (VJ ) be the w∗-closed algebra generated by B1, . . . , Bn and the identity. We proved in [3] that
F ∞n (VJ ) has the A1(1) property and therefore the w∗ and WOT topologies coincide on this algebra. Sim-
ilar results hold for R∞n (VJ ), the w∗-closed algebra generated by W1, . . . , Wn and the identity. Moreover,
we proved in [3] that

F ∞n (VJ )′ = R∞n (VJ ) and R∞n (VJ )′ = F ∞n (VJ ),

where ′ stands for the commutant. An operator M ∈ B(NJ ⊗ K, NJ ⊗ K′) is called multi-analytic with
respect to universal model B := [B1, . . . , Bn] if

We recall from [19] that the set of all multi-analytic operators with respect to B coincides with

M (Bi ⊗ IK) = (Bi ⊗ IK′ )M,

i = 1, . . . , n.

Similar results hold for the algebra F ∞n (VJ ).

R∞n (VJ ) ¯⊗B(K, K′) = PNJ⊗K′[R∞n ¯⊗B(K, K′)]|NJ⊗K.

We mention that, in the particular case when J = {0}, the variety V{0} coincides with the set of
all pure row contractions and the universal models are S = [S1, . . . , Sn] and R := [R1, . . . , Rn]. We
also remark that in the particular case when the ideal J is generated by the polynomials SiSj − SjSi,
i, j = 1, . . . , n, then we have NJ = F 2
Si|F 2
s , the symmetric Fock space, and Bi := PF 2
, i = 1, . . . , n, are
the creation operators on the symmetric Fock space. Arveson showed in [4] that F 2
s can be identiﬁed with
his space H 2, of analytic functions in Bn, namely, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space with reproducing
kernel Kn : Bn × Bn → C deﬁned by

i = 1, . . . , n, and the identity (see [3]). Moreover, Arveson showed in [4] that W∞n can be identiﬁed with
the algebra of all multipliers of H 2. Under this identiﬁcation the creation operators B1, . . . , Bn become
the multiplication operators Mz1 , . . . , Mzn by the coordinate functions z1, . . . , zn of Cn.

The analogue of Theorem 1.5 on noncommutative varieties is the following. Recall that UKT is the set

of all unitary extensions of the isometry deﬁned by relation (1.2).

Theorem 1.6. Let T1 := (T1,1, . . . , T1,n1) and T′1 := (T ′1,1, . . . , T ′1,n1) be elements of the noncommutative
varieties VJ (H) and VJ (H′), respectively, and let T2 := (T2,1, . . . , T2,n2) be a row contraction such that
T2 ∈ I(T1, T′1). Let B := [B1,1, . . . , B1,n1] and W := [W1,1, . . . , W1,n1] be the universal models associated
If U ∈ UKT and ϕU ∗ (R) = (ϕ1(R), . . . , ϕn2 (R)) is the associated multi-analytic

As a consequence of Theorem 1.5, we can obtain a new proof for the commutant lifting theorem for

pure row contractions ([23], [14]) as well as a new constructive method to obtain the lifting.

Theorem 1.7. Let T = (T1, . . . , Tn) ∈ B(H)n and T′ = (T ′1, . . . , T ′n) ∈ B(H′)n be pure row contractions
and let A : H′ → H be an operator such that

AT ′i = TiA,

i ∈ {1, . . . , n}.

Let V = (V1, . . . , Vn) ∈ B(K)n and V′ = (V ′1 , . . . , V ′n) ∈ B(K′)n be the minimal isometric dilations of T
and T′ on some Hilbert spaces K ⊃ H and K′ ⊃ H′, respectively. Then there is an operator B : K′ → K
such that

BV ′i = ViB,

i ∈ {1, . . . , n},

B∗|H = A∗, and kBk = kAk.
Proof. Since T is a pure row contraction, the noncommutative Poisson kernel KT is an isometry, and the
minimal isometric dilation of T is V := (S1 ⊗ IDT , . . . Sn ⊗ IDT), where S1, . . . , Sn are the left creation
operators on the full Fock space F 2(Hn). Under the identiﬁcation of H with KTH, we have

T ∗i = (S∗i ⊗ IDT )|H,

Similar assertions can be made about T′ and its minimal isometric dilation V′ := (S1⊗IDT′ , . . . Sn⊗IDT′ ).
By scaling, we can assume that kAk = 1, without loss of generality. Since A ∈ I(T′, T), we can apply
Theorem 1.5 in the particular case when n2 = 1 and T2 := A. Consequently, there is a contractive multi-

analytic operator ϕ(R) ∈ R∞n ¯⊗B(DT′
of H with KTH and KT′H,respectively, we have A∗ = ϕ(R)∗|H. Since 1 = kA∗k ≤ kϕ(R)∗k ≤ 1, we
deduce that kAk = kϕ(R)k. Since B := ϕ(R) intertwines Si ⊗ IDT′ with Si ⊗ IDT for each i ∈ {1, . . . , n},
the proof is complete.

Proof. Assume that Γ : NJ ⊗ H′ → NJ ⊗ H is a contractive multi-analytic operator with respect to the
universal model B = [B1, . . . , Bn] of the variety VJ , i.e. Γ(Bi ⊗ IH′ ) = (Bi ⊗ IH)Γ for any i ∈ {1, . . . , n}.
Due to the commutant lifting theorem for pure row contractions, Theorem 1.7, there exists a contractive

2. Andˆo type inequalities on noncommutative varieties

In this section, we obtain Andˆo type dilations and inequalities for the elements of the bi-ball P−n
and a class of noncommutative varieties. Moreover, we prove that the bi-ball has a universal model
consisting of the left creation operators and contractive multi-analytic operators. A similar result holds
on noncommutative varieties.

One of the most important consequences of the results from Section 1 is the following Andˆo type dilation
for noncommutative varieties in the bi-ball P−n . We recall that UKT is the set of all unitary extensions
of the isometry deﬁned by relation (1.2) (see also (1.3)). According to Lemma 1.4, for each U ∈ UKT ,
the strong operator topology limit ϕU ∗ (R) := SOT- limr→1 ϕU ∗ (rR) exists and deﬁnes a contractive
multi-analytic operator.

Theorem 2.1. Let T = (T1, T2) ∈ P−n (H) with T1 = (T1,1, . . . , T1,n1) and T2 := (T2,1, . . . , T2,n2). If
T1 is in the noncommutative variety VJ (H) and ϕU ∗ (W) = (ϕ1(W), . . . , ϕn2(W)) is the multi-analytic
operator associated with U ∈ UKT , then

KJ,T1 T ∗1,αT ∗2,β =(cid:0)B∗1,α ⊗ IDT1(cid:1) ϕβ(W)∗KJ,T1 ,

α ∈ F+

, β ∈ F+

,

where B := [B1,1, . . . , B1,n1] and W := [W1,1, . . . , W1,n1 ] are the universal models of VJ and KJ,T1 is the
associated constrained Poisson kernel.

Proof. In the particular case when T1 = T′1, Theorem 1.6 shows that

KJ,T1 T ∗2,j = ϕj (W)∗KJ T1 ,

j ∈ {1, . . . , n2}

and

Hence, the relation in the theorem follows.

KJ,T1 T ∗1,i =(cid:0)B∗1,i ⊗ IDT1(cid:1) KJ,T1,

i ∈ {1, . . . , n1}.

(cid:3)

We remark that Theorem 2.1 provides a model and a characterization of the elements (T1, T2) ∈
P−n (H) with T1 ∈ VJ (H) . Indeed, if T = (T1, T2) ∈ B(H)n1 ×c B(H)n2 , then T ∈ P−n (H) with T1 ∈
VJ (H) if and only if there is a Hilbert space D, a contractive multi-analytic operator (ϕ1(W), . . . , ϕn2(W)
with respect to B, ϕj (W) ∈ B(NJ ⊗ D), and a co-invariant subspace M ⊂ NJ ⊗ D under each of the
operators B1,i ⊗ ID and ϕj(W), where i ∈ {1, . . . , n1} and j ∈ {1, . . . , n2}, such that M can be identiﬁed
with H,

Note that the direct implication is due to Theorem 2.1 under the identiﬁcation of H with KJ,T1H. The
converse is obvious.

(B∗1,i ⊗ ID)|H = T ∗1,i,

and ϕj(W)∗|H = T ∗2,j.

In what follows, we obtain Andˆo type inequalities for the bi-ball P−n (H) and the noncommutative

variety

First, we consider the case when T1 = (T1,1, . . . , T1,n1) and T2 := (T2,1, . . . , T2,n2) are row contractions on
a Hilbert space with the property that T = (T1, T2) ∈ P−c,n(H) with di := dim DTi < ∞ and d1 + n1d2 =

P−c,n(H) :=(cid:8)(T1, T2) ∈ P−n (H) : T1 ∈ VJ (H)(cid:9) .

and assume that XiYj = YjXi for any i ∈ {1, . . . , n1} and j ∈ {1, . . . , n2}. We denote by C hX, Yi the
complex algebra of all polynomials in X1, . . . , Xn1 and Y1, . . . , Yn2 . Note that when n1 = n2 = 1, then
C hX, Yi coincides with the algebra C[z, w] of complex polynomials in two variable.

Theorem 2.2. Let T1 = (T1,1, . . . , T1,n1) and T2 := (T2,1, . . . , T2,n2) be row contractions on a Hilbert
space such that

di := dim DTi < ∞ and d1 + n1d2 = d2 + n2d1 = m,

and let B := [B1,1, . . . , B1,n1] and W := [W1,1, . . . , W1,n1 ] be the universal models of the noncommutative
variety VJ . If T = (T1, T2) ∈ P−c,n(H) and Λ ∈ UT, then
k[prs(T1, T2)]kk ≤ k[prs(B ⊗ ICd1 , ϕΛ(W))]kk,

[prs]k ∈ Mk(C hX, Yi), k ∈ N,

where ϕΛ(W) = (ϕ1(W), . . . , ϕn2 (W)) is a contractive operator uniquely determined by Λ and each
ϕj(W) is a d1 × d1-matrix with entries in the Hardy algebra R∞n1 (VJ ).

Proof. Since d1 + n1d2 = d2 + n2d1 = m, the set UT of all unitary extensions of the isometry U deﬁned
by relation (2.1) is non-empty. Fix any Λ ∈ UT and apply Theorem 2.1 to T = (T1, T2) ∈ P−c,n(H) and
Λ ∈ UT. Then the contractive multi-analytic operator ϕΛ(W) = (ϕ1(W), . . . , ϕn2 (W)) with ϕj(W) ∈
R∞n1(VJ ) ¯⊗DT1 has the property that

for any α ∈ F+

n1 and β ∈ F+

KJ,T1 T ∗1,αT ∗2,β =(cid:0)B∗1,α ⊗ IDT1(cid:1) ϕβ(W)∗KJ,T1

n2. Consequently, if p is any polynomial in C hX, Yi, we obtain

KJ,T1 p(T1, T2) = p(B ⊗ ICd1 , ϕΛ(W))KJ,T1 .

Since T1 ∈ VJ (H), the noncommutative Poisson kernel KJ,T1 is an isometry, which implies

p(T1, T2) = K∗J,T1 p(B ⊗ ICd1 , ϕΛ(W))KJ,T1 .

Now, it is clear that

k[prs(T1, T2)]k×kk ≤ k[prs(B ⊗ ICd1 , ϕΛ(W))]k×kk,

[prs]k×k ∈ Mk(C hX, Yi), k ∈ N,

The proof is complete.

Denote by Q∗n the set of all formal polynomials of the form q(X, Y) = P aα,β,γ,σXαYβY ∗σ X∗γ , with

if we drop the conditions di := dim DTi < ∞ and d1 + n1d2 = d2 + n2d1 = m, in Theorem 2.2, we can
obtain the following Andˆo type inequality.

Theorem 2.3. Let T1 = (T1,1, . . . , T1,n1) and T2 := (T2,1, . . . , T2,n2) be row contractions with the
property that T = (T1, T2) ∈ P−c,n(H). If U ∈ UKT , then

As in Lemma 2.4, if for [pij] ∈ Mk(C hX, Yi), we set

k[pij]ku,k := sup k[pij(T1, T2)]k,

where the supremum is taken over all pairs (T1, T2) ∈ P−n (H) and any Hilbert space H, we obtain a
sequence of norms on the matrices over C hX, Yi. We call (C hX, Yi , k · ku,k) the universal operator
algebra for the bi-ball P−n .

In what follows, we prove that the abstract bi-ball P−n := {P−n (H) : H is a Hilbert space }, where

n = (n1, n2) ∈ N2, has a universal model

(S ⊗ Iℓ2 , ϕ(R)) ∈ P−n (F 2(Hn1 ) ⊗ ℓ2),

where S = (S1, . . . , Sn1 ) and R = (R1, . . . , Rn1) are the left and right creation operators on the full Fock
space F 2(Hn1 ), respectively, and ϕ(R) = (ϕ1(R), . . . , ϕn2(R) is a contractive multi-analytic operator
with ϕj (R) ∈ B(F 2(Hn1 )⊗ℓ2). The next result shows that (C hX, Yi , k · ku,k) can be realized completely
isometrically isomorphic as a concrete algebra of operators.

Theorem 2.5. There is a contractive operator ϕ(R) = (ϕ1(R), . . . , ϕn2 (R)), where each ϕj(R) is a
multi-analytic operator acting on F 2(Hn) ⊗ ℓ2, such that

k[prs(T1, T2)]kk ≤ k[prs(S ⊗ Iℓ2 , ϕ(R))]kk,

prs ∈ C hX, Yi ,

for any (T1, T2) ∈ P−n (H) and k ∈ N.

Proof. Given a polynomial p ∈ C hX, Yi, we deﬁne kpku := sup kp(T1, T2)k, where the supremum is
taken over all pairs (T1, T2) ∈ P−n (H) and any Hilbert space H. Using a standard argument, one can
prove that the supremum is the same if we consider only inﬁnite dimensional separable Hilbert spaces.
Since rT is a pure row contraction for any r ∈ [0, 1), it is clear that

3. Sharper Andˆo type inequalities on varieties, universal models

In this section, we provide sharper Andˆo type inequalities for commuting contractions when at least
one of them is of class C0. In particular, for commuting contractive matrices with spectrum in the open
unit disc, we obtain an inequality which is sharper then Agler-McCarthy’s inequality. We obtain more
general inequalities for arbitrary commuting contractive matrices. Finally, we provide a model for the
universal operator algebra for two commuting contractions.

In the particular case when n = 1, the noncommutative analytic Toeplitz algebra F ∞n can be identiﬁed
with the classical Hardy algebra H∞. Every w∗-closed ideal J 6= {0} of H∞ has the form Jψ = ψH∞,
where ψ ∈ H∞ is an inner function uniquely determined up to a constant of modulus 1 (see [9]). In this
case

NJψ = H 2 ⊖ ψH 2 = ker ψ(S)∗,

where S is the unilateral shift on the Hardy space H 2. An operator X ∈ B(H) is in the variety VJψ (H)
if and only if X is a completely non-unitary contraction such that ψ(X) = 0. The universal model of
. When J = {0}, we take ψ = 0. In this case, we take
VJψ (H) is the truncated shift B := PNJψ
N{0} = H 2 and deﬁne V{0}(H) to be the set of all pure contraction T ∈ B(H), i.e. T ∗n → 0 as n → ∞.
The universal model of V{0}(H) is the unilateral shift S.

Recall that UT is the set of all unitary extensions of the isometry given by relation (1.1). According
to Lemma 1.4, for each U ∈ UT, the strong operator topology limit ϕU ∗ (R) := SOT- limr→1 ϕU ∗ (rR)
exists and deﬁnes a contractive multi-analytic operator.

for any x ∈ H 2(D) ⊗ DT1 . We shall check that this condition is satisﬁed. Since D : DT2 → DT2
is a contraction, there is an orthogonal decomposition DT2 = Hu ⊕ Hs, such that Hu and Hs are
reducing subspaces for D with the property that D1 := D|Hu : Hu → Hu is a unitary operator and
D2 := D|Hs : Hs → Hs is a completely non-unitary contraction. Note that since D2 is acting on a ﬁnite
dimensional space, its spectral radius is strictly less than 1. Indeed, assume that there is λ ∈ T and v 6= 0
in Hs such that D2v = λv. Since D2 is a contraction, we also have D∗2 v = ¯λv, which shows that the

20

restriction of D2 to the span of v is a unitary operator, contradicting that D2 is completely non-unitary.
On the other hand, since U1 is a unitary operator, we have CC∗ + DD∗ = I and AC∗ + BD∗ = 0. If
x ∈ Hu, then kDxk = kxk and, due to the ﬁrst relation above, we must have C∗x = 0. Hence, and using
the second relation, we deduce that B(D∗x) = 0 for any x ∈ Hu, which shows that Hu ⊂ ker B. Now,
since DT2 = rangeB∗ ⊕ ker B, we have

range B∗ = ker B⊥ ⊂ H⊥u = Hs.

Consequently, for any x ∈ H 2(D) ⊗ DT1 , we have y := (I ⊗ B∗)x ∈ H 2(D) ⊗ Hs and, therefore,

(I − rS ⊗ D∗)−1 (I ⊗ B∗)x = (I − rS ⊗ D∗2)−1 y.

Since kS ⊗ D2k < 1, we have

(I − rS ⊗ D∗2)−1 y = (I − S ⊗ D∗2)−1 y,

and, consequently, relation (1.11) is satisﬁed, which proves that ϕU ∗
In a similar fashion, one can show that if U2 ∈ U(T2,T1) then ϕU ∗

We recall [26] that a contraction T ∈ B(H) is called of class C0 if T is c.n.u. and there exists an inner
function u ∈ H∞ such that u(T ) = 0. It is well-known that there is an essentially unique minimal inner
function mT ∈ H∞ such that mT (T ) = 0. It is clear that T ∈ VJmT

Let T be a contractive matrix and assume that it has no eigenvalues of modulus 1. This is equivalent to
saying that the contractive matrix is completely non-unitary (c.n.c). Let mT (z) = (z −λ1)n1 · · · (z −λk)nk
be the minimal polynomial of T and let JT be the w∗-closed two sided ideal of H∞ generated by mT .

Theorem 3.3. Let T1 and T2 be commuting contractive matrices such that T1 is completely non-unitary
and let d1 := dim(I − T1T ∗1 )1/2H. For any unitary operator U ∈ U(T1,T2), ϕU ∗ (S) is an isometric analytic

where B1 := PNT1
Proof. Since T1 is a completely non-unitary contraction on a ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space, we can use
the Jordan canonical form to show that T1 is a pure contraction, i.e. (T ∗1 )n → 0 stronly, as n → ∞.
Applying Theorem 3.1 to the commuting contractive matrices T1 and T2, when ψ1 = mT1 , the minimal
polynomial of T1, and ψ2 = 0, the result follows.

Proof. Applying Theorem 3.3 to the pairs (T1, T2) and (T2, T1) of commuting contractive matrices, the
result follows.
(cid:3)

A few remarks are necessary. If T1 and T2 are commuting contractive matrices with no eigenvalues of
modulus 1, Agler-McCarthy proved, in their remarkable paper [1], that the pair (T1, T2) has a co-isometric
extension (M∗z , M∗Φ) on H 2 ⊗ Cd and, for any polynomial p in two variables,
(3.1)
where V is a distinguished variety in D2 depending on T1 and T2, deﬁned by

kp(T1, T2)k ≤ kp(Mz ⊗ ICd , MΦ)k ≤ kpkV ,

V := {(z, w) ∈ D2 : det(Φ(z) − wICd )}.

We remark that the inequalities provided in Theorem 3.3 and Corollary 3.4 are sharper than Andˆo’s
inequality and Agler-McCarthy’s inequality, due to the fact that

k(PNT1⊗Cd )p(Mz ⊗ ICd , MΦ)|NT1⊗Cdk ≤ kp(Mz ⊗ ICd , MΦ)k ≤ kp(U1, U2)k,

where U1 and U2 are commuting unitaries extending the isometries Mz ⊗ ICd and MΦ, respectively. We

On the other hand, since T1 is in the variety Vk := {X ∈ B(H) : X k = 0} and the model operator for Vk
is B := PPk−1 S|Pk−1, where S is the unilateral shift and Pk−1 := span {1, z, . . . , zk−1} ⊂ H 2, Theorem
3.3 implies

kp(T1, T2)k ≤ kp(B ⊗ ICd , ϕ(B))k = kaBk = a.

Example 3.7. Let Ck, k ≥ 0, be the set of all nilpotent contractive matrices of order k, and consider the

If 2 ≤ k ≤ n and ϕ(Mz) is any inner analytic operator on H 2 ⊗ Cd, then

Therefore, if T1 ∈ Ck, then Agler-McCarthy inequality becomes

kp(B ⊗ ICd , ϕ(B))k = k(I + B + · · · + Bk−1)ϕ(B)k

where B := PPk−1 S|Pk−1 is the model for the varierty Ck. Theorem 3.3 implies

kp(T1, T2)k ≤ kp(B ⊗ ICd , ϕ(B))k ≤ k.

Proposition 3.8. Let T1 and T2 be commuting contractive matrices such that σ(T1) ⊂ T and T2 is
completely non-unitary. Then, for any polynomial p in two variables,

kp(T1, T2)k ≤ max
λ∈σ(T1)

kp(λ, B2,λ)k ≤ max
λ∈σ(T1)

kp(λ, B2)k

where B2,λ is the universal model for T2|Eλ and Eλ is the eigenspace corresponding to the unimodular
eigenvalue λ ∈ σ(T1).

Proof. Assume that T1 and T2 are acting on a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space H. Since σ(T1) ⊂ T, one
can easily see that T1 is a unitary operator, Indeed, this is due to the well-known fact that a contraction
T1 and its adjoint T ∗1 have the same invariant vectors, i.e. T1h = h if and only if T ∗1 h = h (see [26]).
For each λ ∈ σ(T1), let Eλ be the corresponding eigenspace. Since T2 commutes T1, which is unitary
operator, it commutes with each spectral projection PEλ . Therefore, each eigenspace Eλ is reducing for

T2 as well. With respect to the decomposition H = Lλ∈σ(T1) Eλ we have T1 = Lλ∈σ(T1) λPEλ and
T2 =Lλ∈σ(T1) T2|Eλ. For any polynomial p in two variables, we have

p(λIEλ , T2|Eλ ) and kp(T1, T2)k = max

kp(λIEλ , T2|Eλ)k.

p(T1, T2) = Mλ∈σ(T1)

If B2,λ is the universal model for T2|Eλ, then, applying
Since T2 is c.n.u., so is each operator T2|Eλ.
Theorem 3.3 to the pair (T2|Eλ), we deduce that kp(λIEλ , T2|Eλ)k ≤ kp(λ, B2,λ)k, which proves the ﬁrst
inequality of the proposition. To prove the second one, note that the minimal polynomial of T2|Eλ divides
the minimal polynomial of T2 and, consequently, B2,λ = PN B2|N , where N := NmT2|Eλ
. This completes
the proof.

and the decomposition is unique [26]. Since the spectrum of A1 consists of eigenvalues of modulus one

where A2 := T2|Hu and B2 := T2|Hcnu. Note that A1A2 = A2A1 and B1B2 = B2B1. The next step is to

For simplicity, we write T ∈ D2 if T is a pair (T1, T2) of commuting contractions on a Hilbert space.

A closer look at the proof of Lemma 3.13 reveals that

that Lemma 3.13 can be easily extended, with the same proof, to the abstract polydisk Dn.

N stands for the set of all pairs (T1, T2) of nilpotent commuting contractions. We also remark

Theorem 3.14. There is an isometric analytic Toeplitz operator ϕ(S) ∈ B(H 2(D) ⊗ ℓ2) such that

k[prs(T1, T2)]kk ≤ k[prs(S ⊗ Iℓ2 , ϕ(S))]kk,

for any commuting contractions T1, T2 ∈ B(H), any k × k matrix [prs]k of polynomials in C[z, w], and
any k ∈ N.

Proof. According to Lemma 3.13, k[pij]kku = k[pij]kkF for any k × k matrix [pij]k of polynomials in
C[z, w]. Hence, we deduce that

Due to Theorem 3.1, when VJψ = B(H), for each m ∈ N, we ﬁnd d(m) ∈ N and an isometric analytic
Toeplitz operator ϕm(S) on the Hardy space H 2(D) ⊗ Cd(m) such that

Therefore, relation (3.4) implies

Hence, we deduce that

k[pij]kku = k[pij(S ⊗ Iℓ2 , ψ(S))]kk,

(3.5)
where ψ(S) := ⊕∞m=1ϕm(S)) is an isometric analytic Toeplitz operator on the Hardy space H 2(D) ⊗ ℓ2.
Let CQ[z, w] be the set of all polynomials with coeﬃcients in Q+iQ. Since the set {[pij]k : pij ∈ CQ[z, w]}
is countable, let [p(1)
ij ]k, . . . be an enumeration of it. Due to relation (3.5), for each s ∈ N, there is
an isometric analytic Toeplitz operator ψs(S) on the Hardy space H 2(D) ⊗ ℓ2 such that

Due to relations (3.5), (3.9), and (3.8), we deduce that there exists an isometric analytic Toeplitz operator

for any ǫ > 0, which proves relation (3.7). Now, it is easy to see that ϕ(S) := ⊕∞k=1Γk(S) is an isometric
analytic operator acting on H 2(D) ⊗ ℓ2 such that

k[qij]kku = k[qij(S ⊗ Iℓ2 , ϕ(S))]kk

for any [qij ]k ∈ Mk(C[z, w]) and any k ∈ N. The proof is complete.

(cid:3)

Note that since S⊗Iℓ2 and ϕ(S) are commuting isometries, we can extend them to commuting unitaries,

due to Itˆo’s theorem [26], and using the spectral theorem we obtain

kp(T1, T2)k ≤ kp(S ⊗ Iℓ2 , ϕ(S))k = kpkD2.

for any commuting contractions T1, T2 ∈ B(H) and any polynomial p in C[z, w], recovering in this way
Andˆo’s inequality. The closed non-self-adjoint algebra generated by S ⊗ Iℓ2 , ϕ(S) and the identity is
denoted by Au(D2). In light of Theorem 3.14, Au(D2) can be seen as the universal operator algebra for
two commuting contractions.

We remark that the operator ϕ(S) is Theorem 3.14 is a direct sum of inner analytic operators on
H 2(D) ⊗ Ck, k ∈ N. Consequently, using Agler-McCarthy’s inequality [1] we deduce that there is a
sequence of distinguished varieties {Vk}∞k=1 in D2 such that

for any commuting contractions T1 and T2, and any polynomial p in two variables.

kp(T1, T2)k ≤ sup
