Metal-insulator transition in correlated two-dimensional systems with disorder

National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida 32310, USA

Dragana Popovi´c

Experimental evidence for the possible universality classes of the metal-insulator transition (MIT)
in two dimensions (2D) is discussed. Suﬃciently strong disorder, in particular, changes the nature
of the transition. Comprehensive studies of the charge dynamics are also reviewed, describing
evidence that the MIT in a 2D electron system in silicon should be viewed as the melting of the
Coulomb glass. Comparisons are made to recent results on novel 2D materials and quasi-2D strongly
correlated systems, such as cuprates.

I.

2D METAL-INSULATOR TRANSITION AS A QUANTUM PHASE TRANSITION

The metal-insulator transition (MIT) in 2D systems remains one of the most fundamental open problems in con-
densed matter physics [1–4]. The very existence of the metal and the MIT in 2D had been questioned for many
years but, recently, considerable experimental evidence has become available in favor of such a transition. Indeed, in
the presence of electron-electron interactions, the existence of the 2D MIT does not contradict any general idea or
principle (see also chapters by V. Dobrosavljevi´c, and A. A. Shashkin and S. V. Kravchenko). It is important to recall
that a qualitative distinction between a metal and an insulator exists only at temperature T = 0: the conductivity
σ(T = 0) 6= 0 in the metal, and σ(T = 0) = 0 in the insulator. Therefore, the MIT is an example of a quantum phase
transition (QPT) [5]: it s a continuous phase transition that occurs at T = 0, i.e. between two ground states. It is
controlled by some parameter of the Hamiltonian of the system, such as carrier density, the external magnetic ﬁeld, or
pressure, and quantum ﬂuctuations dominate the critical behavior. In analogy to thermal phase transitions, a QPT
is characterized by a correlation length ξ ∝ |δ|−ν and the corresponding timescale τξ ∼ ξz, both of which diverge in
a power-law fashion at the critical point. Here δ is a dimensionless (reduced) distance of a control parameter from
its critical value, ν is the correlation length exponent and z is the dynamical exponent. Because of the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle, in a QPT there is a characteristic energy (temperature) scale

T0 ∼



τξ ∼ |δ|νz,

(1)

which decreases to zero in a power-law fashion as the critical point is approached (Fig. 1).

The existence of a diverging correlation length leads to the expectation that, in the vicinity of a critical point, the
behavior of the system will exhibit a certain degree of universality, independent of microscopic details. Indeed, while
microscopic theories describing the MIT remain controversial, scaling behavior is a much more robust and general
property of second-order phase transitions (e.g. [4]). In the case of a MIT, which is controlled by changing the carrier
density n, it is the conductivity that can be described in the critical region (Fig. 1) by a scale-invariant form as

σ(n, T ) = σc(T )f (T /T0) = σc(T )f (T /|δ|zν),

where δ ≡ δn = (n − nc)/nc (nc is the critical density) and

σc(T ) ≡ σ(n = nc, T ) ∝ T x

is the critical conductivity. From the scaling description, it also follows that, in the metallic phase at T = 0,

σ(n, T = 0) ∝ δµ
n,

(2)

(4)

such that the conductivity exponent µ = x(zν). Thus the behavior observed in the T = 0 limit [Eq. (4)] also provides
a stringent test of the scaling behavior observed at T 6= 0 [Eqs. (2) and (3)]. One of the goals of the scaling analysis
is to reveal critical exponents that characterize the transition and correspond to speciﬁc universality classes.
The simplest scaling scenario predicts the validity of “Wegner scaling” for which the conductivity exponent µ =
(D − 2)ν, where D is the dimensionality of the system. This would imply that, at the 2D MIT, x = (D − 2)/z = 0, so
the critical conductivity should not depend on T . It is for this reason that many early studies of the 2D MIT identiﬁed
nc as the carrier density where dσ/dT changes sign from insulator-like (dσ/dT > 0) to metallic (dσ/dT < 0). However,
it should be emphasized that scaling with x 6= 0 for 2D systems does not contradict any fundamental principle [6].
Indeed, such violations of “Wegner scaling” were predicted in the presence of “dangerously irrelevant operators” [7],

FIG. 1: The phase diagram of a system near a quantum phase transition. A quantum critical point at T = 0 and δ = 0
separates two ground states, e.g. an insulator and a metal. The red dashed line denotes a smooth crossover at T0 ∼ |δ|νz.
Well-deﬁned diﬀerences between the two phases, such as insulating vs. metallic behavior, are observed only at T < T0. At
T > T0, the system is in the “quantum critical region”, in which both quantum and thermal ﬂuctuations are important. Scaling
behavior is expected in the entire (blue hatched) critical region.

for example for certain microscopic models with strong spin-dependent components of the Coulomb interactions [8–
10]. As discussed below, it is precisely the general scaling form, Eq. (2) with x 6= 0, that provides a satisfactory and
consistent description of all the data near a 2D MIT.
In general, a QPT can aﬀect the behavior of the system up to surprisingly high temperatures. In fact, many unusual
properties of various strongly correlated materials have been attributed to the proximity of quantum critical points.
An experimental signature of a QPT at nonzero T is the observation of scaling behavior with relevant parameters in
describing the data. At T 6= 0, however, the correlation length is ﬁnite, so single-parameter scaling in Eq. (2) will
work only if the sample size L > ξ. Otherwise, the scaling function will depend not only on T /T0, but also on another
scaling variable ∼ L/ξ. Such ﬁnite-size eﬀects have not been observed in the experimental studies of the 2D MIT so
far: the scaling functions have been found to depend only on T /T0, indicating that sample sizes have been suﬃciently
large for the experimental temperature range.

In real systems near a MIT, both disorder and electron-electron interactions may play an important role and lead
to out-of-equilibrium or glassy behavior of electrons (e.g.
[11]). The goal of this chapter is thus twofold. First, it
will focus on studies of the critical behavior of conductivity in 2D electron systems with diﬀerent amounts and types
of disorder, as well as diﬀerent ranges of Coulomb interactions, in order to identify possible universality classes of
the 2D MIT. Second, experimental results obtained using a variety of protocols to probe charge dynamics will be
reviewed, providing important information about the nature of the insulating phase and the 2D MIT. The focus will
be on detailed and comprehensive studies that have been carried out so far only on a 2D electron system (2DES) in
(100)-Si metal-oxide-semiconductor ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors (MOSFETs). However, recent results on novel 2D systems,
in particular, a single- or few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides, and on quasi-2D strongly correlated materials,
such as cuprates, will be also discussed.

II. CRITICAL BEHAVIOR OF CONDUCTIVITY

2DESs in semiconductor heterostructures [12] are relatively simple systems for exploring the interplay of electronic
correlations and disorder, because all the relevant parameters – carrier density ns, disorder and interactions – can be
varied easily. For example, ns can be tuned over two orders of magnitude by applying voltage Vg to the gate electrode.
At low ns, the 2DES is strongly correlated: rs ≫ 1, where rs = EC /EF ∝ n−1/2
(EC is the average Coulomb energy
per electron and EF is the Fermi energy; see also [2] for more details). Therefore, the eﬀects of interactions become
increasingly important as ns is reduced.

In Si MOSFETs, random potential (disorder) that is “felt” by the 2DES is caused by charged impurities (Na+
ions), which are randomly distributed in the oxide and thus spatially separated from the 2DES. In these devices,
the (Drude) mobility µ = σ/(nse) of the 2DES peaks as a function of ns because, at very high ns that are not of
interest here, the scattering due to the roughness of the Si-SiO2 interface becomes dominant [12]. The peak mobility

FIG. 2: Scaling of conductivity in a low-disorder Si MOSFET with µpeak ≈ 1 m2/Vs (from [15]). The scaling ranges of ns and
T are given on the plot; nc = (1.67 ± 0.02) × 1011cm−2.

at 4.2 K, µpeak, is commonly used as a rough measure of the amount of disorder. As described below, detailed studies
of σ(ns, T ) demonstrate scaling behavior consistent with the existence of a QPT in all 2DESs in Si regardless of the
amount of disorder.

A. Role of disorder

1. Low-disorder samples

Si MOSFETs with relatively little disorder (µpeak[m2/Vs]∼ 1−3) make it possible to access lower electron densities,
and thus the regime of stronger interactions, before strong localization sets in.1 The corresponding values of rs near
the critical density have been rs > 13.
In such low-disorder samples, the most obvious feature that suggests the
existence of a metal is the large, almost an order-of-magnitude increase of conductivity with decreasing temperature
(dσ/dT < 0) observed at2 T < TF and low ns, where rs ≫ 1. However, this does not necessarily imply σ(T = 0) 6= 0,
i.e. a metallic ground state. Therefore, even though such a strong dσ/dT < 0 had been known for a long time (e.g.
[13]), it was not considered as evidence for a metallic state.
Indeed, it was only after dynamical scaling (2) was
demonstrated [14] and independently conﬁrmed on a diﬀerent set of devices [15] that the problem of the 2D MIT
attracted renewed attention.

In those experiments, it was possible to collapse all the σ(ns, T ) data near nc onto the same function f (T /T0)
with two branches, the upper one for the metallic side of the transition and the lower one for the insulating side
(see Fig. 2), using the same values zν = 1.6 and x = 0. The temperature ranges for scaling were also comparable:
0.08 . T /TF . 0.4 in Fig. 2 [15] and 0.05 . T /TF . 0.3 in Ref. [14]. The critical density nc was identiﬁed as the
“separatrix”, i.e. the density n∗
s where dσ/dT changes sign. Subsequently, other, more appropriate methods were
used to identify nc.
In particular, nc was determined based on both a vanishing activation energy [16–18] and a
vanishing nonlinearity of current-voltage (I − V ) characteristics when extrapolated from the insulating phase [16, 19],
and established that indeed nc ≈ n∗
s. It is important to stress, however, that this is true only in low-disorder samples
with non-magnetic scattering. The situation is very diﬀerent in the presence of scattering by local magnetic moments
and in highly disordered samples. In those cases, the two densities can be vastly diﬀerent, as shown in Sections II A 2
and II A 3.

Therefore, the ﬁrst studies of scaling near a 2D MIT seemed to be consistent with “Wegner scaling”, in which the
critical conductivity (3) does not depend on temperature, i.e. the exponent x = 0. Not long after, it was realized
that this simple scaling scenario fails in the metallic regime at the lowest temperatures where, following its initial

1 In the strongly localized or insulating regime, the conductivity decreases exponentially with decreasing temperature, leading to σ(T =

0) = 0.

2 The Fermi temperature TF [K]= 7.31ns[1011cm−2] for electrons in Si MOSFETs [12].

bias on the sample was Vsub = −40 V (adapted from [24]). The data can be scaled with x = 0 (similarly to Fig. 2) around the

large increase, σ(T ) becomes a weak function as T → 0 [20, 21]. A careful analysis of the data showed [22, 23] that
they could be scaled according to the more general form (2) with σc = σ(nc, T ) ∝ T x, x 6= 0 (the scaling range
was 0.02 . T /TF . 0.2). This type of scaling implies, of course, that σc vanishes as T → 0, i.e. nc does not
s, but instead σc(T ) belongs to the insulating family of curves. This conclusion is
coincide with the “separatrix” n∗
consistent with the results of activation energy and nonlinear I − V studies that reported a small but systematic
s [20, 21]. Nevertheless, it has proven diﬃcult to determine the exponent
diﬀerence of a few percent such that nc < n∗
x reliably, because the weak, low-T behavior of σ(T ) is observable only over a narrow range of very low temperatures
(T ∼ 0.1 K), when it becomes diﬃcult to cool the electrons in the experiment. In samples that are slightly more
disordered (µpeak . 1 m2/Vs), the onset of the weak σ(T ) (or an apparent “saturation” on a logarithmic scale) in
the metallic regime takes place at higher temperatures, e.g. at T . 1 K in Fig. 3(left), where it is easy to cool the
electrons. This shows that the weak metallic σ(T ) (“saturation”) observed at low T is an intrinsic eﬀect and its onset
depends on disorder. Here it is still possible to scale the data at T > 1 K with zν = 1.6 and x = 0 around the
s = 1.25 × 1011cm−2), but it is obvious that this
“separatrix” (open black triangles in Fig. 3(left) corresponding to n∗
curve acquires an insulating T -dependence at T < 1 K, so that “Wegner scaling” will fail. However, it is still diﬃcult
to make reliable ﬁts to σ(T ) in the low-T regime, so that the direct determination of the exponent x in low-disorder
samples remains a challenge.

On the other hand, by extrapolating the metallic “saturation” of σ to T = 0, it has been found [26] that σ(ns, T =
0) ∝ δµ
s,
n, with the exponent µ = 1− 1.5. The critical density nc obtained in this way was by about 1-5% lower than n∗
in agreement with the results of the activation energy and nonlinear I − V studies. Some estimates of the exponent
x may be made then based on the relation µ = x(zν).
Scaling with x 6= 0 is also observed in 3D materials near the MIT [27]. Other striking similarities near the MIT
between transport properties of a 2DES in low-disorder Si MOSFETs and those observed in Si:B, a 3D system, were
pointed out early on [15]. For example, in Si:B, magnetoconductance, which is negative, depends strongly on the
carrier concentration and shows a dramatic decrease at the transition [28]. Such anomalous behavior was attributed
to electron-electron interactions. In a 2DES, the negative component of the magnetoconductance, which arises from
the spin-dependent part of the electron-electron interaction [29], also decreases rapidly at the transition, suggesting
that electron-electron interactions may play a similar role in both 2D and 3D systems near the MIT [15].

In recent years, many diﬀerent types of experiments, including both transport and thermodynamic measurements,
have been performed on low-disorder samples. Some of those studies are discussed in detail in the chapter by A.
A. Shashkin and S. V. Kravchenko. There is mounting evidence that suggests that electron-electron interactions are
responsible for a variety of phenomena observed in the metallic regime of low-disorder 2DES near the MIT, including a
large increase of σ with decreasing temperature (dσ/dT < 0) [30]. In particular, since the most striking experimental
features are not sensitive to weak disorder (see, e.g., the thermopower study [31]), they have been interpreted as
evidence that the MIT in such low-disorder systems is driven by electron-electron interactions and that disorder
has only a minor eﬀect. It is thus important to compare the properties of the MIT, such as critical exponents, in
low-disorder samples to those obtained in samples with a diﬀerent type or amount of disorder.

in Fig. 3(right) and T < 2 K. From [25].

2. Special disorder: local magnetic moments

It turns out that the metallic behavior with dσ/dT < 0 is easily suppressed by scattering of the conduction electrons
by disorder-induced local magnetic moments. More precisely, even an arbitrarily small amount of such scattering is
suﬃcient to suppress the dσ/dT < 0 behavior in the T → 0 limit [24]. It is important to note that this does not
necessarily indicate the destruction of the metallic phase. In disordered 3D metals, for example, it is well known that
the derivative dσ/dT can be either negative or positive near the MIT [29]. Indeed, as described below, in the presence
of local magnetic moments, the 2DES exhibits in the metallic phase the simplest σ(T ), observed over two decades of
T , allowing for an unambiguous extrapolation to T = 0 and an excellent ﬁt to the dynamical scaling described by
Eq. (2).

In Si MOSFETs, it is possible to change the disorder, for a ﬁxed ns, by applying bias Vsub to the Si substrate (back
gate) [12]. In particular, the reverse (negative) Vsub moves the electrons closer to the interface, which increases the
disorder. It also increases the splitting between the subbands since the width of the triangular potential well at the
interface in which the electrons are conﬁned is reduced by applying negative Vsub. Usually, only the lowest subband
is occupied at low T , giving rise to the 2D behavior. However, in suﬃciently disordered samples or wide enough
potential wells, the band tails associated with the upper subbands can be so long that some of their strongly localized
states may be populated even at low ns, and act as additional scattering centers for 2D electrons. In particular, since
at least some of them must be singly populated due to a large on-site Coulomb repulsion (tens of meV), they may
act as local magnetic moments. Clearly, the negative Vsub reduces this type of scattering by depopulating the upper
subband. Therefore, the eﬀects of local magnetic moments on the transport properties of the 2DES were studied by
varying Vsub [24, 25]. It is important to note that the presence of local moments did not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on
the value of µpeak, probably because the upper subband is depopulated at high Vg, where mobility peaks.3

Figure 3 illustrates the eﬀect of local magnetic moments on σ(T ) in the same sample: while dσ/dT < 0 is observed
at high ns in the absence of local moments (left panel), σ(T ) curves become insulator-like (dσ/dT > 0) for all ns
after many local moments are introduced (right panel). In the latter case, the critical density can be easily identiﬁed
by plotting the data on a log-log scale (not shown): at nc, the conductivity obeys a pure power-law form (3) with
x ≈ 2.6 [25]. For ns < nc, σ(T ) decreases exponentially, as expected in the insulating phase. For ns > nc, a simple
and precise form σ(ns, T ) = σ(ns, T = 0) + A(ns)T 2 is observed from about 2 K down to the lowest accessible
T = 0.020 K [32]. Figure 4(left) shows that the extrapolated zero-temperature conductivity is a power-law function
of δn (4), i.e. σ(ns, T = 0) ∝ δµ
n (µ ≈ 3), as expected in the vicinity of a quantum critical point [33]. Furthermore, the
data obey dynamical scaling (2) with zν ≈ 1.3 [Fig. 4(right)] and a T -dependent critical conductivity (3) with x ≈ 2.6,
i.e. in agreement with theoretical expectations near a QPT. The consistency of the scaling analysis is conﬁrmed by

comparing µ = x(zν) = 3.4 ± 0.4 obtained from scaling with µ = 3.0 ± 0.1 determined from the T = 0 extrapolation
of σ(ns, T ) [Fig. 4(left)].
The exponent zν is thus comparable to that found in low-disorder samples in the absence of scattering by local
magnetic moments (Sec. II A 1; see also Sec. II D). On the other hand, unlike zν, the exponent x seems to be more
sensitive to the type of scattering (magnetic vs. nonmagnetic).
It is also noted that scaling with a T -dependent
prefactor σc(T ) is not consistent with the simple single-parameter scaling hypothesis [34], which allows only for a
dσ/dT < 0 behavior in the conducting phase, but it does not violate any general principle and it is analogous to the
MIT in 3D systems.

3. High-disorder samples

The most interesting situation is found in high-disorder samples, where electron-electron interactions are still
strong (e.g. rs ∼ 7 near nc). Indeed, the competition between disorder and interactions leads to the striking out-of-
equilibrium or glassy behavior near the MIT and in the insulating regime. The manifestations of glassiness in both
low- and high-disorder samples are discussed in Sec. III. However, charge dynamics has been studied in more detail
in high-disorder 2DESs, and there is ample evidence for the MIT and for the importance of long-range Coulomb
interactions also in these systems [11]. Thus one of the key questions that arises is: What is the nature of the MIT
in a high-disorder 2DES with interactions? More precisely, is it dominated by disorder, or is it the same as the MIT
in a low-disorder 2DES, which seems to be driven by interactions? The scaling behavior discussed below provides
compelling evidence (a) for the existence of a metal-insulator QPT and (b) that suﬃciently strong disorder changes
the universality class of the MIT.

Detailed studies of transport and electron dynamics near the MIT have been performed on a set of Si MOSFETs4
with µpeak ≈ 0.06 m2/Vs. A typical σ(ns, T ) is shown in Fig. 5 Because of the glassy ﬂuctuations of σ with time t at
low ns and T , Fig. 5 actually shows the time-averaged conductivity hσi, and the error bars correspond to the size of
the ﬂuctuations with time. In this Section, which focuses on the behavior of the average conductivity, the notation σ

FIG. 6: Experimental phase diagram of the 2DES in Si MOSFETs. The MIT takes place at nc and T = 0. The nature of the
metallic phase at high ns, such that kF l > 1, is still under debate. The glass transition occurs at Tg = 0 for all ns < ng: the
solid red line thus represents a line of quantum critical points. In the intermediate, metallic glassy phase nc < ns < ng, σ(T )
obeys a particular, non-Fermi liquid form. The aging properties of the glass change abruptly at nc, indicating diﬀerent natures
of the insulating and metallic glass phases. In low-disorder samples, the intermediate phase vanishes: nc . n∗

work even in the presence of large ﬂuctuations. For example, it has been demonstrated that, for the case of Anderson
transitions, scaling is, in fact, valid not only for the average conductance, but also for all moments even when relative
ﬂuctuations ∆σ/hσi ∼ 1 [36]. Therefore, exploring the average conductance to get information about the MIT is well
justiﬁed.
Similar to other high-disorder samples or samples with very low 4.2 K peak mobility (µpeak < 0.1 m2/Vs), there

(Sec.
activation energies in the insulating regime to zero. Surprisingly, here nc turns out to be more than a factor of two
s (Fig. 5). For ns > nc, the low-T data are best described by the metallic (σ(T = 0) > 0) power law
smaller than n∗
σ(ns, T ) = σ(ns, T = 0) + b(ns)T 1.5 [35]. The surprising non-Fermi liquid (NFL) T 3/2 behavior is consistent with
theory [37, 38] for the transition region between a Fermi liquid and an (insulating) electron glass. Indeed (see Sec.
III A), the transition into a charge (Coulomb) glass in high-disorder samples takes place as T → 0 at a density ng,
s (Fig. 5). The T 3/2 correction is characteristic of transport in the intermediate, nc < ns < ng
such that nc < ng < n∗
region where the dynamics is glassy, but where σ is still metallic [σ(T → 0) 6= 0] albeit so small that kF l < 1 (Fig.
6; kF – Fermi wave vector, l – mean free path). For kF l < 1, there is indeed no reason to expect standard Fermi
liquid behavior. The simple form of σ(T ) in the intermediate, metallic phase allows a reliable extrapolation to T = 0.
The extrapolated values of σ(ns, T = 0) go to zero at nc that is in agreement with that obtained from the data on
the insulating side of the MIT, and σc(T ) ∝ T x with x = 1.5. For clarity, the main experimental observations are
summarized in Fig. 6.
Figure 7 demonstrates that, near nc, the data exhibit dynamical scaling σ(ns, T )/σc(T ) ∝ σ(ns, T )/T 1.5, a signature
of the QPT, also in this system. The scaling parameter follows a power law, T0 ∝ |δn|zν (Fig. 7 inset), in agreement
with theoretical expectations near a QPT. The value of the critical exponents zν ≈ 2.1 obtained here represents a major
diﬀerence from the consistently lower zν = 1.0− 1.7 found in low-disorder 2DES [14, 15, 20, 24, 25, 40, 41], indicating
that suﬃciently strong disorder changes the nature of the MIT from interaction-driven in low-disorder samples to
disorder-dominated in high-disorder 2DES. Before discussing diﬀerent universality classes further (Sec. II D), another
central issue needs to be addressed ﬁrst, namely, the role of the range of electron-electron interactions in the 2D MIT.

B. Eﬀects of the range of electron-electron interactions

According to the scaling theory of localization [42], all electrons in a disordered, noninteracting 2D system become
localized at T = 0. Therefore, interactions must play a key role in stabilizing a metallic ground state in 2D. An
important question then is how the length scale of the Coulomb interactions controls the ground state and the
properties of the MIT. However, a vast majority of experiments on 2D systems (e.g. those discussed elsewhere in this

chapter and in chapter by A. A. Shashkin and S. V. Kravchenko) have been carried out on devices in which Coulomb
interactions are not screened. At the same time, the use of a nearby metallic gate or ground plane to limit the range
of the Coulomb interactions between charge carriers in 2D systems is a well-known technique that has been explored
both theoretically (see, e.g., [43–49]) and experimentally, e.g., in the investigation of the melting of the Wigner crystal
formed by electrons on a liquid He surface [50].

In the context of the 2D MIT in low-disorder devices, screening by the gate has been used to explore the role of
Coulomb interactions in the metallic [51] and insulator-like [52] regimes of a 2D hole system (2DHS) in AlGaAs/GaAs
heterostructures and in the metallic regime of Si MOSFETs [53]. The focus of those studies, however, was on the
form of σ(T ), and especially on the sign of dσ/dT . In particular, there have been no studies of scaling and critical
exponents, that is, of the properties of the quantum critical point itself.

In the case of low-disorder 2DES with local magnetic moments, there have been no studies at all of the eﬀects

of screened Coulomb interactions.

On the other hand, in high-disorder Si MOSFETs, studies of scaling behavior of σ(ns, T ) on both metallic and
insulating sides of the MIT were carried out on devices in which the long-range part of the Coulomb interaction
is screened by the gate [39]. The metallic gate at a distance d from the 2DES creates an image charge for each

electron, modifying the Coulomb interaction from ∼ 1/r to ∼ [1/r− 1/√r2 + 4d2]. When the mean carrier separation
a = (πns)1/2 ≫ d, this potential falls oﬀ in a dipole-like fashion, as ∼ 1/r3. Therefore, in Si MOSFETs, the range of
the electron-electron Coulomb interactions can be changed by varying the thickness of the oxide dox = d. Importantly,
measurements were done on a set of MOSFETs that had been fabricated simultaneously as the high-disorder devices
with long-range Coulomb interactions discussed in Sec. II A 3 (see also Figs. 5 and 7). In the latter case, dox = 50 nm,
comparable to that in other Si MOSFETs used in the vast majority of studies of the 2D MIT [1–3, 11].
In the
dox = 50 nm samples, in the low-ns regime of interest near the MIT, the corresponding 5.3 . d/a ≤ 8.0. On the other
hand, in “thin-oxide” devices with dox = 6.9 nm [39], substantial screening by the gate is expected in the scaling
regime of ns near the MIT, where 0.7 . d/a . 1.0. For comparison, in ground-plane screening studies carried out on
low-disorder samples, 0.8 ≤ d/a ≤ 1.8 in Ref. [53], 1.1 . d/a ≤ 5 in Ref. [52], and 2 ≤ d/a ≤ 19 in Ref. [51].
follows.5

In general, the results obtained on high-disorder, thin-oxide samples resemble those on thick-oxide devices, as

1. At the lowest ns, σ(T ) decreases exponentially with decreasing T , in agreement with the 2D variable-range
hopping law, indicating an insulating ground state. The critical density nc is determined from the vanishing of
the activation energy, as described earlier.

2. For ns > nc, the low-T data are best described by the metallic power law σ(ns, T ) = σ(ns, T = 0) + b(ns)T 1.5.

FIG. 8: (a) Scaling of σ/σc ∝ σ/T x, x = 1.5, for a high-disorder sample with a thin oxide (dox = 6.9 nm), i.e. with screened
Coulomb interactions. Diﬀerent symbols correspond to ns from 3.40 × 1011 cm−2 to 6.70 × 1011 cm−2; nc = 4.26 × 1011 cm2.
It was possible to scale the data below about 1.5 K, over the range 0.007 . T /TF . 0.04. Inset: T0 vs. δn. The lines are ﬁts
with slopes zν = 1.98 ± 0.03 and zν = 1.91 ± 0.02 on the insulating and metallic sides, respectively. (b) σ(ns, T = 0) vs ns.
The dashed line guides the eye. (c) σ(ns, T = 0) vs δn = (ns − nc)/nc, the distance from the MIT. The solid line is a ﬁt with
the slope equal to the critical exponent µ = 2.7 ± 0.3. From [39].

This type of non-Fermi-liquid behavior was found to be a characteristic of the intermediate, metallic glassy phase
observed in high-disorder samples with long-range Coulomb interactions (Sec. II A 3), as well as in low-disorder
2DES in parallel magnetic ﬁeld (Sec. II C). At nc, σc ∝ T x with x = 1.5.

3. On the metallic side of the MIT, the extrapolated σ(ns, T = 0) go to zero [Fig. 8(b)] at the same density as nc
n [Fig. 8(c)] is in agreement with

obtained from the insulating side. The power-law behavior σ(ns, T = 0) ∝ δµ
general expectations (4). The critical exponent µ = 2.7 ± 0.3.

4. Finally, in the vicinity of the MIT, the conductivity can be described by a scaling form (2) [Fig. 8(a)]; here
zν ≈ 2.0. As expected for a QPT, the same value of zν is found, within experimental error, on both sides of the
transition. The consistency of the scaling analysis is conﬁrmed by comparing µ = x(zν) = 3.0 ± 0.3 obtained
from scaling with µ = 2.7 ± 0.3 found from the T = 0 extrapolations of σ(ns, T = 0).

The most signiﬁcant result is that the critical exponents in thin- and thick-oxide high-disorder devices are the same,
and thus not sensitive to the range of the Coulomb interactions. Indeed, in such a disorder-dominated MIT, it is
plausible that the length scale of the Coulomb interactions does not seem to play a major role. It is important to note,
though, that there may be some other quantities that are more sensitive to the range of the Coulomb interactions and
that would be aﬀected by the proximity to the gate. E.g. the fate of the glassy behavior in a 2DES with short-range
Coulomb interactions remains an open question.

C. Eﬀects of magnetic ﬁeld

Magnetic ﬁelds B applied parallel to the 2DES plane couple only to electrons’ spins and, therefore, they are often
used to probe the importance of spin, as opposed to charge, degrees of freedom. One of the main questions addressed
in such studies in the context of the 2D MIT has been the fate of the metallic phase in a parallel B. High-disorder
2DESs have not been investigated yet, but on low-disorder samples, it has been established that the metallic phase
and the MIT survive in high parallel B such that the 2DES is fully spin-polarized. In particular, (ns, B, T = 0) phase
diagrams have been determined both in the absence [18] and presence of local magnetic moments [32]. Just like in
B = 0, the properties of the MIT as a QPT have proved easier to study and analyze in systems with local moments,
because of their stronger and better-deﬁned σ(T ). In the absence of local moments, the situation is more subtle, as
described below.

In zero ﬁeld, studies of charge dynamics in a low-disorder 2DES (with no local moments) have established (Sec. III B)
that the onset of glassy behavior essentially coincides with the MIT, i.e. ng ≈ nc. A parallel B, however, gives rise
to an intermediate, metallic glassy phase (Fig. 9) with the same, non-Fermi-liquid form σ(ns, B, T ) = σ(ns, B, T =
0) + b(ns, B)T 1.5 as what was observed in high-disorder samples at B = 0. Once again, such a simple and well-deﬁned

The nc values are from [18] (dots) and [16] (triangles). The glass transition takes place at ng(B) > nc(B), giving rise to an

n,
µ ≈ 1.5, for a given B [18], in agreement with theoretical expectations near a QPT. Therefore, it is the emergence of
the metallic glassy phase in B 6= 0 that makes it possible to determine nc also from the metallic side of the MIT,
the task that, in zero ﬁeld, remains a challenge (Sec. II A 1). The remarkable agreement between nc(B) obtained from
σ(T ) on both insulating and metallic sides of the MIT are strong evidence for the survival of the MIT and the metallic
phase in parallel B. In contrast to highly disordered samples, here the intermediate phase spans a very narrow range
of ns and, therefore, it can be observed only if ns is varied in ﬁne steps. Finally, detailed studies of the behavior in
the metallic glassy phase and the MIT have been performed so far only up to about 4 T in Fig. 9, the ﬁeld above
which the 2DES is fully spin polarized. Properties of the MIT at higher ﬁelds, that is, between a spin-polarized metal
and a spin-polarized insulator, await future study.

In the presence of local magnetic moments, it is interesting that the (ns, B, T = 0) phase diagram [32] is quite
similar to that shown in Fig. 9, even though the dσ/dT behaviors in the metallic phase at B = 0 are strikingly
diﬀerent (Sections II A 1 and II A 2). This similarity probably results from the general expectation of a power-law
shift of nc with B in the case of a true MIT [6]. Such a shift has been observed also in several 3D systems [28, 54–56].

D. Possible universality classes of the 2D metal-insulator transition

All the critical exponents have been summarized in Table I [39]. Based on their values, it appears that the 2D MIT
in Si MOSFETs can be divided into three universality classes: a) high disorder, b) low disorder, and c) low disorder
in the presence of scattering by local magnetic moments. However, so far there have been no studies of high-disorder
samples with local moments.

Table I also includes, where available, the values obtained in low parallel B (i.e. B not high enough to fully spin
polarize the 2DES [57, 58]). In low parallel B, [nc(B)/nc(0) − 1] ∝ Bβ with β = 1.0 ± 0.1 for low-disorder samples
both in the absence [16, 18, 59, 60] and presence of scattering by local magnetic moments [32]. It is apparent that
such low ﬁelds do not seem to aﬀect any of the critical exponents.

On the other hand, there is a major diﬀerence between the values of zν in high- and low-disorder devices, indicating
that suﬃciently strong disorder changes the nature of the MIT from the interaction-driven to disorder-dominated.
The possibility of a disorder-dominated 2D MIT has been demonstrated theoretically [61] for both long-range and
short-range interactions. Although there is currently no microscopic theory that describes the detailed properties of
the observed disorder-dominated MIT, it is interesting that in the available theories [6, 61], the range of the Coulomb
interactions does not play a signiﬁcant role, consistent with experimental observations. In the interaction-driven MIT
in low-disorder 2DESs (see also chapter by V. Dobrosavljevi´c), the eﬀect of the range of electron-electron interactions
on the critical exponents still remains to be studied experimentally.

It should be also noted that percolation models [62] cannot describe these ﬁndings. E.g.

the 2D percolation
µ ≃ 1.3, as opposed to the much larger experimental µ ≃ 3 in high-disorder samples and low-disorder devices with
local magnetic moments (Table I). In fact, it is interesting that the same large µ ≃ 3 is observed in those two types

zν seems to depend on the amount of disorder, the exponent x instead appears to be more sensitive to the type of
disorder (e.g. magnetic vs nonmagnetic).

In order to conﬁrm the proposed universality classes of the 2D MIT (Table I), which have been established based
on studies of Si MOSFETs, it is clearly necessary to probe the behavior of 2D systems in other types of materials,
in particular beyond conventional semiconductor heterostructures. New families of 2D crystals, formed by extract-
ing atomically thin layers of materials with weak interlayer van der Waals interactions [63, 64], represent specially
promising candidates for such investigations.

E. Metal-insulator transition in novel 2D materials

2D materials extracted from van der Waals solids, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g. MoS2, WS2, MoSe2,
WSe2), represent a new avenue for exploring quantum critical phenomena and the eﬀects of dimensionality on corre-
lated electronic phases, and may also lead to development of new electronic and optoelectronic applications. Indeed,
there is currently intensive activity in device fabrication based on 2D atomic layers, including FETs, photodetectors,
light emitting devices, etc. [65].

Recently, FETs with mobilities as high as ∼ 0.03 m2/Vs at a few K have been reported in MoS2 [66] and ReS2
[67]. Those mobilities are comparable to µpeak in high-disorder Si MOSFETs (Sec. II A 3), which had been fabricated
using a commercial 0.25-µm Si technology [68]. In both MoS2 and ReS2 FETs, metallic dσ/dT < 0 behavior was
observed at high ns & 1013cm−2, and the transition to dσ/dT > 0 temperature dependence at somewhat lower ns
was attributed to a 2D MIT. Although all the material parameters may not be known precisely [67], it is estimated
that rs ∼ 4 near the apparent MIT in both types of devices, i.e. a bit smaller than in high-disorder 2DES in Si where
rs ∼ 7.
It is interesting that, in ReS2, σ(T ) exhibits nonmonotonic behavior at high ns [Fig. 10(a)] reminiscent of a low-
disorder 2DES in which scattering by local magnetic moments is controlled by varying the substrate bias. Figure 10(b),
for example, shows the eﬀect of Vsub in a Si MOSFET for a ﬁxed ns > nc: while dσ/dT < 0 for a large negative
Vsub = −50 V, reducing the negative Vsub leads to the emergence of a maximum in σ(T ), such that dσ/dT > 0
in the entire experimental T range for Vsub = +1 V. It is understood [24, 25] that, for T below the maximum, the
scattering is dominated by local magnetic moments (Sec. II A 2; also Fig. 3). Most notably, it has been shown [67] that
σ(T ) of few-layer ReS2 FETs at temperatures below the maximum obey dynamical scaling (2) with the exponents
x ≈ 2.3, zν ≈ 1.3, and µ ≈ 2.9, the latter being consistent with µ = x(zν) ≈ 3.0. It is most striking that these
values indeed agree, within error, with the exponents established for (low-disorder) samples in which local moments

dominate (Table I).6

Although the agreement between critical exponents obtained on ReS2 and those on 2DES in Si is encouraging,
there are several caveats. For example, in ReS2 there is some uncertainty in the determination of ns as a function of
Vsub so that, depending on the method used, the data analysis may yield a diﬀerent set of exponents (e.g. x ≈ 3.4,
zν ≈ 0.6, µ ≈ 2.1; [67]). In addition, scaling was performed at fairly high T . TF and over a limited range of ns in
the insulating regime. Therefore, not only do the measurements need to be extended to much lower T and ns, but
also it is important to gain better understanding of the basic FET and material characteristics before reliable results
on the 2D MIT can be obtained on ReS2 and other novel 2D materials.

III. CHARGE DYNAMICS NEAR THE 2D METAL-INSULATOR TRANSITION AND THE NATURE

OF THE INSULATING STATE

Section II focused on the critical region near the 2D MIT, in particular on describing conductivity measurements
that have demonstrated dynamical scaling (2), the main signature of the MIT as a quantum phase transition. The
critical exponents, which have been determined for both interaction-driven and disorder-dominated MIT (Sec. II D),
represent a property of the quantum critical point. However, these studies do not provide information about the
nature of the metallic and insulating phases. The chapter by A. A. Shashkin and S. V. Kravchenko discusses various
experimental results obtained in the metallic regime of low-disorder 2DES. In contrast, this Section focuses on
experiments that probe the nature of the insulating state, as well as charge dynamics across the MIT, in both
high- and low-disorder 2DESs.

There is substantial evidence that in many materials near the MIT, both strong electronic correlations and disorder
play an important role, and thus their competition is expected to lead to glassy behavior of electrons, in analogy
with other frustrated systems [69, 70]. A common denominator for all glasses is the existence of a complex or
“rugged” free energy landscape, consisting of a large number of metastable states, separated by barriers of diﬀerent
heights. This results in phenomena such as slow, nonexponential relaxations, divergence of the equilibration time,
and breaking of ergodicity, i.e. the inability of the system to equilibrate on experimental time scales. Therefore,
such out-of-equilibrium systems also exhibit aging eﬀects [71, 72], where the response to an external excitation (i.e.
relaxation) depends on the system history in addition to the time t. A detailed analysis of temporal ﬂuctuations
(noise) of the relevant observables yields complementary information on conﬁgurational rearrangements or transitions
between metastable states.7 Non-Gaussian distributions of various observables in glassy systems have been reported
[74], reﬂecting the presence of large, collective rearrangements. Therefore, the two basic ways to probe the dynamics
of glassy systems involve studies of relaxations and ﬂuctuations.

6 As noted in Sec. II D, there have been no studies of high-disorder samples with local magnetic moments.
7 In equilibrium systems, the connection between spontaneous ﬂuctuations of a variable and the response of such a variable to a small per-
turbation in its conjugated ﬁeld is given by the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation. See [73] for the review and discussion of thermodynamics
of out-of-equilibrium systems.

s
13

Most experimental studies of charge or Coulomb glasses have focused on situations where electrons are strongly
localized due to disorder, i.e. deep in the insulating regime and far from the MIT [75]. In recent years, however,
studies of both relaxations and ﬂuctuations (or noise) in Si MOSFETs have provided evidence for out-of-equilibrium
or glassy dynamics of the 2DES in the insulating regime, near the MIT, and just on the metallic side of the transition
in the intermediate, metallic glassy phase (Fig. 6). Those results, described below (see also [11]), impose strong
constraints on the theories for the 2D MIT, and should be also helpful in understanding the complex behavior near
the MIT in a variety of strongly correlated materials.

A. High-disorder 2D electron systems

Glassy charge dynamics in a high-disorder 2DES was probed using several diﬀerent experimental protocols, all of
which can be divided into two groups: one of them involves applying a large (with respect to EF ) perturbation to the
system and studying the relaxations of conductivity, and the other one involves a study of conductivity ﬂuctuations
with time as a result of a small perturbation. In all experiments, kBT was the lowest energy scale.

A large perturbation was applied to the 2DES by making a large charge in Vg or carrier density, i.e. such that
kBT ≪ EF < ∆EF . In one protocol, which involved a study of the relaxations σ(t) following a rapid change of ns,
the following key manifestations of glassiness were established [76] for all ns below the glass transition density ng
(nc < ng, i.e. ng is on the metallic side of the MIT; Fig. 6).

1. The temperature dependence of the equilibration time τeq obeys a simply activated form, so that τeq → ∞ as
T → 0. The diverging equilibration time means that, strictly speaking, the system cannot reach equilibrium
only at T = 0, i.e. the glass transition temperature Tg = 0.

2. At low enough T , however, τeq can easily exceed experimental times (e.g. at 1 K, τeq is estimated to exceed
the age of the Universe by several orders of magnitude!), so that the system appears glassy: for t < τeq, the
relaxations obey a nonexponential form, which reﬂects the existence of a broad distribution of relaxation times.
3. Nonexponential relaxations obey dynamical scaling σ(t, T )/σ0(T ) ∝ t−α(ns) exp[−(t/τ (ns, T ))β(ns)], where 0 <
α(ns) < 0.4, 0.2 < β(ns) < 0.45, such that in the T → 0 limit, the relaxations attain a pure power-law form
σ/σ0 ∝ t−α. The dynamical scaling and the power-law relaxation at Tg are consistent with the general scaling
arguments [77] near a continuous phase transition occurring at Tg = 0, similar to the discussion in Sec. I.

A key characteristic of relaxing glassy systems is the loss of time translation invariance, reﬂected in aging eﬀects
[71, 72, 78]. Therefore, in another protocol, relaxations σ(t) were studied after a temporary change of ns during the
waiting time tw. The sample history was varied by changing tw and T for several initial (ﬁnal) ns. The main results
include the following.

1. It was demonstrated that the 2DES exhibits aging, and the conditions that lead to memory loss and nonmono-

tonic response were identiﬁed precisely [79].

2. There is an abrupt change in the nature of the glassy phase exactly at the 2D MIT itself, before glassiness
disappears completely at a higher density ng: (a) while the so-called full aging8 is observed in the insulating
regime (ns < nc), there are signiﬁcant departures from full aging in the metallic glassy phase, i.e for nc < ns <
ng; (b) the amplitude of the relaxations peaks just below the MIT, and it is strongly suppressed in the insulating
phase [80, 81].

3. As the system ages and slowly approaches equilibrium, the non-Gaussian conductance noise becomes increasingly

Gaussian [82], similar to the behavior of a great variety of out-of-equilibrium systems.

The results of the aging studies represent strong evidence that the insulating glassy phase and the metallic glassy
phase are diﬀerent. It should be also noted that, in the mean-ﬁeld models of glasses, for example, two diﬀerent cases
are distinguished: one, where full aging is expected, and the other, where no t/tw scaling is expected [83]. Therefore,
the diﬀerence in the aging properties below and above nc puts constraints on the theories of glassy freezing and its
role in the physics of the 2D MIT.

8 In case of full or simple aging, the aging function σ(t, tw) exhibits scaling with t/tw.

FIG. 11: History dependence of the probability density functions of the ﬂuctuations measured in a high-disorder 2DES at
T = 0.24 K for several carrier densities n0(1011cm−2), as shown; ng ≈ 7.5 × 1011cm−2 (from [82]). hσ0i is the time-averaged
conductivity corresponding to n0 at the measurement T , obtained after cooling. The red curves are ﬁts to a Gaussian distri-
bution. Left column: PDFs of the noise after cooling from 10 K to 0.24 K for each given n0. The cooling time was at least one
hour long. In this protocol, hσ(t)i ≡ hσ0i, i.e. there are no observable relaxations after cooling. Right column: PDFs of the
noise measured after a subsequent change of ns from n0 to a much higher value n1 = 20.26 × 1011cm−2 during tw = 1000 s. In
this protocol, hσ(t)i describes the slowly relaxing background.

In the second group of experiments, a small perturbation was applied either by making a small change in ns, such
that kBT < ∆EF ≪ EF [17, 35, 82, 84], or by cooling, i.e. making a small change in T , such that kBT < kB∆T ≪ EF
[82]. In both cases, there were no observable relaxations of σ, but large non-Gaussian conductance noise emerged for
ns < ng. The non-Gaussian nature of the noise indicates that the ﬂuctuating units are correlated.

The noise was studied by analyzing the full probability distribution of the ﬂuctuations (or the probability density
function, PDF), power spectrum, and the so-called second spectrum, which is a fourth-order noise statistic. The
analysis indicates that the slow, correlated behavior is consistent with the so-called hierarchical picture of glassy
dynamics, similar to conventional, metallic spin glasses [85]. In that scenario, the system wanders collectively between
many metastable states related by a kinetic hierarchy. Metastable states correspond to the local minima or “valleys” in
the free energy landscape, separated by barriers with a wide, hierarchical distribution of heights and, thus, relaxation
times. Intervalley transitions, which are reconﬁgurations of a large number of electrons, thus lead to the observed
strong, correlated, 1/f -type noise.

Therefore, the 2DES has many characteristics in common with a large class of both 2D and 3D out-of-equilibrium
systems, strongly suggesting that many such universal features are robust manifestations of glassiness, regardless of
the dimensionality of the system. However, it appears that there are also some eﬀects that may be unique to Coulomb
glasses. This is illustrated in Fig. 11, for example, where PDFs obtained after cooling (left column) are compared to
those obtained after a subsequent large change of ns during the waiting time tw (right column). What is striking is that,
even though the PDFs were measured under exactly the same experimental conditions, they look remarkably diﬀerent
for all ns < ng. In particular, the non-Gaussian PDFs obtained after cooling are smooth, single-peaked functions,
reminiscent of PDFs in a variety of systems displaying critical [86, 87], glassy [74], or other out-of-equilibrium behavior
(e.g. the Danube water level [88]). In all these systems, the PDFs are skewed, resembling a zero-centered Gaussian,

15

which describes pseudoequilibrium ﬂuctuations, with one (exponential) tail that is due to large, rare events.
In
contrast, a temporary change in ns results in complex, multipeaked, random-looking PDFs. Similar complicated,
multipeaked PDFs were observed also after a small change of ns (not shown). Therefore, these results demonstrate
not only that noise depends on history, as may be expected in a glassy system, but also that the change of ns has a
qualitatively diﬀerent and more dramatic eﬀect than ∆T . In fact, the results strongly suggest that the density change
reshuﬄes all energies, because of the Coulomb interactions, thus modifying the free energy landscape of the 2DES.
For this reason, theoretical modeling of the glassy dynamics in this system might be considerably more diﬃcult than
in some other types of glassy materials.

B. Low-disorder 2D electron systems

Studies of charge dynamics in low-disorder 2DESs have so far included only small perturbation protocols, i.e.
measurements of the conductance ﬂuctuations following a small change of ns, including the analysis of the higher-
order statistics [17]. Qualitatively, the same behavior was observed as in high-disorder samples: there is a well-deﬁned
density ng below which the noise becomes non-Gaussian and increases by several orders of magnitude as ns or T
are reduced. This slow, correlated noise is consistent with the hierarchical pictures of glassy dynamics, as described
above. The only diﬀerence is that, in a low-disorder 2DES, the intermediate glassy phase practically vanishes and the
glass transition coincides with the MIT (ng ≈ nc).
Noise measurements were performed also in parallel B [18]. By adopting the same criteria for the glass transition as
in zero ﬁeld, it was possible to determine ng(B) shown in Fig. 9, identify the emergence of the intermediate, metallic
glassy phase (see Sec. II C), and to establish that charge, not spin, degrees of freedom are responsible for glassy
ordering. Therefore, the results demonstrate that the 2D MIT is closely related to the melting of this Coulomb glass.
In fact, experiments on both high- and low-disorder 2DESs in Si strongly support theoretical proposals describing
the 2D MIT as the melting of a Coulomb glass [37, 89–93]. In particular, a model with Coulomb interactions and
suﬃcient disorder [89] predicts the emergence of an intermediate metallic glass phase. The theoretical work, however,
still needs to be extended to studies of the critical behavior, including critical exponents. Experimentally, it would
be interesting to perform relaxation studies on low-disorder samples to look for aging phenomena, which may also
provide further insights into the nature of the insulating, Coulomb glass phase.

IV. CONDUCTOR-INSULATOR TRANSITION AND CHARGE DYNAMICS IN QUASI-2D

STRONGLY CORRELATED SYSTEMS

Many novel materials are created by doping an insulating host and thus are close to a conductor-insulator transition.
For example, there is now broad agreement [94] that the problem of high-temperature superconductivity in copper
oxides is synonymous to that of doping of a Mott insulator. Arguments have been put forward that, in weakly doped
Mott insulators near the MIT, the system will settle for a nanoscale phase separation between a conductor and an
insulator [95–97]. This leads to the possibility for a myriad of competing charge conﬁgurations and the emergence
of the associated glassy dynamics, perhaps even in the absence of disorder [98]. Indeed, cuprates and many other
materials exhibit various complex phenomena due to the existence of several competing ground states [99], thus
providing strong impetus towards the better understanding of the MIT and the behavior of the charge degrees of
freedom. However, experimental studies near the conductor-insulator transition in many materials, such as cuprates,
are complicated by the accompanying changes in magnetic or structural symmetry. On the other hand, those materials
are usually layered, with weak interlayer coupling, so that, in most instances, they behave eﬀectively as 2D systems.
Therefore, comparative studies of the MIT and charge dynamics in 2DESs in semiconductor heterostructures and in
strongly correlated quasi-2D materials, such as cuprates, present an especially promising approach in addressing the
problem of complexity near the MIT in strongly correlated systems. Such studies should make it possible to separate
out eﬀects that are more universal from those that are material speciﬁc.

In La2−xSrxCuO4 (LSCO), the prototypical cuprate high-temperature superconductor, conductance (or resistance)
noise spectroscopy was employed at very low T [100, 101] to probe charge dynamics in the lightly doped regime
where the ground state is insulating. Here the charge carriers, doped holes, seem to populate areas that separate
the hole-poor antiferromagnetic (AF) domains located in CuO2 planes. The magnetic moments in diﬀerent domains
are known to undergo cooperative freezing at a temperature TSG (∼ a few K) into a “cluster spin glass” phase. The
noise measurements demonstrated the emergence of slow, correlated dynamics and nonergodic behavior at very low
T ≪ TSG, deep inside the spin-glass phase, which rules out spins as the origin of the observed glassy dynamics. In
addition, all the noise characteristics were found to be insensitive to both the magnetic ﬁeld and the magnetic history,
further indicating that the observed glassiness reﬂects the dynamics of charge, not spins. This is analogous to the

16

FIG. 12: Phase diagram shows the evolution of the glassy region and the emergence of superconducting ﬂuctuations (SCFs)
and superconductivity (SC) with doping, temperature and magnetic ﬁeld in La2−xSrxCuO4 (from [106]). The extent of the
glassy regime does not depend on the ﬁeld orientation. The range of SCFs is shown for the ﬁeld applied perpendicular to CuO2
planes. Solid and dashed lines guide the eye. Diﬀerent colors of symbols for H ′
c(T ) and Tc(H) correspond to diﬀerent values of
doping.

magnetic insensitivity of the noise in a glassy, fully spin-polarized 2DES in Si [18]. The gradual enhancement of the
glassy behavior in LSCO with decreasing T strongly suggests that the phase transition to a charge glass state occurs
at Tg = 0, similar to a 2DES (Sec. III). In contrast to a 2DES, however, the non-Gaussian statistics in LSCO is not
consistent with the hierarchical picture of glasses, but rather reﬂects the presence of some characteristic length scale.
This result supports the picture of spatial segregation of holes into interacting, hole-rich droplets or clusters, which
are separated by hole-poor AF domains.

Additional evidence for charge-glass behavior at low T in lightly doped, insulating LSCO was found from dielectric
[102] and magnetotransport [103] studies. The observed history-dependent resistance and hysteretic magnetoresis-
tance [100, 103, 104] were then used to explore the key question in the physics of cuprates, namely how such an
insulating, dynamically heterogeneous ground state evolves with doping and gives way to high-temperature supercon-
ductivity [105, 106]. The (x, T, H) phase diagram (Fig. 12), where x (in this Section) is doping, H is a magnetic ﬁeld
perpendicular to CuO2 planes, shows that a collective, glassy state of charge clusters located in CuO2 planes is sup-
pressed by increasing the doping. At the same time, adding charge carriers leads to the formation of localized Cooper
pairs (or superconducting ﬂuctuations) already within this insulating, intrinsically heterogeneous charge-ordered state,
consistent with the so-called Bose glass picture for the transition from an insulator to a superconductor (SIT) [107].
Surprisingly, it was also found (not shown) that the superconducting ﬂuctuations on the insulating side were quenched
at low temperatures by the charge glass order. Therefore, the pair localization and the onset of SIT in LSCO are
inﬂuenced by a competing charge order, and not merely by disorder, as seems to be the case in some conventional
superconductors. Those observations provide a new perspective on the mechanism for the SIT.

The experiments discussed above were carried out on samples in which the number of carriers was varied by
chemical doping. In order to study scaling associated with the T = 0 superconductor-insulator transition, however,
that method has the disadvantage that the carrier concentration cannot be tuned continuously, and also it alters the
level of disorder in the material. Therefore, electrostatic charging, similar to that in semiconductor heterostructures,
would be preferable. Recently, it has become possible to electrostatically induce large concentration changes in a
variety of novel materials [108]. In cuprates, ionic liquids have been used to make FET-like devices to study scaling
near the SIT in thin ﬁlms of hole-doped La2−xSrxCuO4 [109], YBa2Cu3O7−x [110] and La2CuO4+δ [111], and electron-
doped Pr2−xCexCuO4 [112]. The observed scaling appeared consistent with the so-called bosonic picture [107], in
which Cooper pairs are localized on the insulating side of the SIT and the critical resistivity is independent of T .9

9 The additional presence of some fermionic excitations at ﬁnite T on the insulating side was suggested for the electron-doped cuprate [112].

17

The obtained critical exponents zν were 1.5, 2.2, 1.2, and 2.4, respectively, but the reasons for that diﬀerence are not
understood. Moreover, in contrast to the 2DES in Si (Sec. II), the scaling was done over a limited range of parameters:
typically, T /T0 spans only about an order of magnitude, and the lowest T ∼ a few K. Clearly, it would be important
to extend these studies to much lower T . Interestingly, it was found that scaling in YBa2Cu3O7−x breaks down below
6 K, suggesting that the SIT may not be direct and may involve an intermediate phase [110]. Unfortunately, there
were not suﬃcient data available to resolve this issue (the lowest T in that experiment was 2 K), so that the questions
about the nature of the carrier-concentration-driven SIT and whether it involves an intermediate phase in the T → 0
limit remain open for all cuprates.
Finally, in analogy to a 2DES in Si (Sec. III), electrostatic doping opens up an exciting possibility to investigate
glassy relaxations that may accompany quantum phase transitions in cuprates and other strongly correlated systems.
Such studies should provide a much better understanding of the phases and quantum criticality.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Experimental studies of the critical behavior of conductivity in a variety of two-dimensional electron systems in
Si provide strong evidence for the existence of a sharp, T = 0 metal-insulator transition at low electron densities
regardless of the amount of disorder. The critical exponents obtained from dynamical scaling suggest that there are
several universality classes of the 2D MIT, depending on the amount and type of disorder. Since other types of
experiments carried out on the metallic side of the transition indicate that the MIT in low-disorder samples is driven
by electron-electron interactions, this implies that the MIT in high-disorder samples is dominated by disorder. In
both cases, however, Coulomb interactions between electrons must play a key role in stabilizing the metallic phase.

The role of long-range Coulomb interactions is further revealed in the studies of charge dynamics across the MIT,
which demonstrate that, in both low- and high-disorder systems, the insulating state is a Coulomb glass. The
peculiarity of a 2DES with a high amount of disorder is the emergence of an intermediate phase between the metal
and the insulator, which is poorly metallic and glassy. The aging properties demonstrate, however, that the nature
of the metallic glassy phase is diﬀerent from that of the insulating Coulomb glass.

While the above experimental ﬁndings await theoretical description and understanding, novel 2D materials, such
as those extracted from van der Waals solids, as well as quasi-2D strongly correlated materials, including cuprates,
present promising new avenues for testing the generality of the observed phenomena and gaining further insight into
the problem of the MIT.
