Abstract: The use of simpliﬁed models as a tool for interpreting dark matter collider
searches has become increasingly prevalent, and while early Run II results are beginning to
appear, we look to see what further information can be extracted from the Run I dataset.
We consider three ‘standard’ simpliﬁed models that couple quarks to fermionic singlet dark
matter: an s-channel vector mediator with vector or axial-vector couplings, and a t-channel
scalar mediator. Upper limits on the couplings are calculated and compared across three
alternate channels, namely mono-jet, mono-Z (leptonic) and mono-W/Z (hadronic). The
strongest limits are observed in the mono-jet channel, however the computational simplicity
and absence of signiﬁcant t-channel model width eﬀects in the mono-boson channels make
these a straightforward and competitive alternative. We also include a comparison with
relic density and direct detection constraints.

1 Introduction

Simpliﬁed models have emerged as a powerful tool for the interpretation of collider, direct
and indirect detection signals of dark matter (DM). Previously, ATLAS and CMS searches
for DM were conducted within the context of both Eﬀective Field Theories (EFTs) [1–4]
and full UV-complete theories such as Supersymmetry [5–8]. The latter approach, though
well-motivated, is typiﬁed by a broad parameter space and generally yields results which
are insensitive to the wider class of DM models. EFT constraints, in comparison, are
applicable to a broad range of models and rely on the speciﬁcation of only a small set of
parameters, namely the suppression scale, M(cid:63), and the DM mass, mDM [9].

In the EFT framework, interactions between the dark and Standard Model (SM) sec-
tor are parametrised by a set of higher-dimensional eﬀective operators that arise when the
mass of the mediating particle is assumed to be signiﬁcantly larger than the momentum
transferred in a given interaction. Where this condition is not fulﬁlled, the EFT pre-
scription can produce constraints which detour dramatically from those of the associated
UV-complete model [9–13]. This is less important in direct detection experiments where
the momentum transferred in the scattering of DM particles with heavy nuclei is generally
of the order of tens of MeV [14, 15], or in indirect searches where the annihilations of
non-relativistic DM particles in the galactic halo occur with momentum transfers of order
mDM. However, for hadron collider searches, where the accessible center of mass energy
of two colliding baryons may be suﬃcient to produce the mediator on-shell, the range of
validity of the EFT prescription is signiﬁcantly diminished.
Indeed, recent works have
√
quantitatively shown that the EFT approach can break down as a valid interpretation of
data collected during the
ˆs = 8 TeV Run I of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [16–19].
In light of this, simpliﬁed models have become the preferred tool for the interpretation of
collider DM searches [20–24].

In a nutshell, a simpliﬁed model (SiM) arises when the heavy mediator which was inte-
grated out in the EFT framework is reintroduced. Like EFTs, SiMs admit the comparison
of results obtained in the diﬀerent avenues of dark matter study [25, 26] and are deﬁned
by a relatively small set of parameters - namely mDM, the mass of the mediator Mmed,
and the SM-mediator and DM-mediator coupling strengths, gq and gχ (or gqχ in the case
of a single, SM-DM-mediator coupling). Unlike EFTs, constraints calculated within the
context of a SiM are valid across a broad energy range.

In this paper, we examine a phenomenologically distinct set of SiMs. In particular,
we place constraints on the SiMs corresponding to the simplest UV-completions of the D5
(vector) and D8 (axial-vector) eﬀective operators in the s-channel1. We also include a case
in which a scalar mediator is exchanged in the t-channel, motivated by its analog of squark
exchange in Supersymmetry.
In the heavy mediator limit, the operator describing this

1The D5 and D8 operators form a nice starting point in the analysis of SiMs as they have been studied
exhaustively in the past (see refs. [1–4, 17–19, 27, 28] among others). This attention is motivated by the
fact that collider limits for the D5 (D8) operator can be readily transformed into limits on spin-independent
(spin-dependent) DM-nucleon scattering and vice versa.

model can be rearranged via a Fierz transformation into a combination of operators D5 to
D8.

The models are constrained using public results from mono-X + missing transverse
energy (Emiss
T ) searches conducted by the ATLAS Collaboration. Speciﬁcally, we focus on
searches where X is either a parton (manifesting in the detector as a narrow-radius jet),
a leptonically-decaying Z boson (manifesting as two opposite-sign same-ﬂavor leptons), or
a hadronically-decaying W or Z boson (manifesting as a large-radius jet). The purpose of
this work is to strengthen existing SiM limits using the full 20.3 f b−1 of Run I ATLAS
data, and to explore an enhanced phase space with respect to the mediator and DM masses
and the relative strength of the couplings to the visible and dark sectors. We choose to
treat the mediator width as the minimal value naturally arising, which is more realistic
than a ﬁxed width. Lastly, we provide a cross-check and comparison of the performance of
the three targeted collider detection channels, and compare against relic density and direct
detection constraints.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 contains a compendium of
the SiMs chosen for analysis and the associated collider phenomenology. Section 3 outlines
the techniques used to recast mono-X + Emiss
limits on the visible cross-section for any
new physics process into constraints on SiMs, and speciﬁcally on the couplings gq and gχ.
Lastly, our results are presented in section 4 along with a discussion of the implications of
this work. Appendices A and B include details of the limit setting and analysis validation
procedures.

2 Simpliﬁed model phenomenology

2.1 Model descriptions

We begin with a short set of assumptions: that the DM particle, χ, is a weakly interacting
Dirac fermion, that it is a singlet under the SM, and that it is the lightest stable new
particle. Additionally, the new sector is assumed to couple only to the SM quarks. While
possible couplings to SM leptons or gluons have been studied elsewhere (see, for example,
ref. [11, 29]), they are beyond the scope of this paper. The nature of the mediating particle
then results from these assumptions: in the s-channel it is chosen to be a vector particle
which then must also be a SM singlet, denoted ξ, while in the t-channel we chose a scalar
particle which is necessarily charged and coloured, and labelled φ.

The s-channel models chosen for analysis are Z(cid:48)-type models characterised by vector
(sV ) or axial-vector (sA) couplings to both the dark and SM sectors. They are described
by the following interaction Lagrangians:

where the sum is over all quarks. This is a simple extension of the standard model and has
been studied extensively [23, 24, 30–47]. For the couplings gq and gχ to remain within the
perturbative regime, they are required to satisfy gq, gχ ≤ 4π, though stronger perturbativity
requirements do exist [17].

The t-channel model (abbreviated tS) is primarily motivated by analogy with a com-
mon aspect of Supersymmetric models: neutralino DM interacting with the SM sector via
t-channel exchange of a squark [48], and has been studied within the context of collider
searches by a number of groups [25, 45, 49–55]. Note that in this Supersymmetric scenario
the DM particle is a Majorana fermion. The collider phenomenology of a SiM in which χ
is of Majorana type is kinematically identical to the corresponding Dirac case (requiring
multiplication of the cross-section by a simple factor in order to compute limits) and so
Majorana DM is not covered here2.

In the tS model, the mediator is allowed to couple to either the left or right-handed
quarks as an SU(2) doublet or singlet respectively. Since the LHC is insensitive to the
chirality of the quarks, we assume for simplicity that φ couples to the left-handed quarks
only, and is itself an SU(2) doublet, allowing radiation of a W boson. To avoid diﬀerent
couplings to quarks of diﬀerent generations, and to remain in step with the DM Forum
recommendations [22], we include three generations of mediator doublets φi, with equal
masses and couplings. The interaction Lagrangian for this model is then:

where the sum is over the three quark doublets, gqχ is the DM-quark coupling (equal for
each generation), and PR is the usual chiral projection operator.

2.2 The mono-X + Emiss

T

signatures

T

The mono-X + Emiss
signal (abbreviated to mono-X) is a popular collider signal in the
search for new physics, particularly in the search for dark matter. Since DM particles are
not expected to interact with detector material, they appear as missing transverse energy
when balanced against a visible object, X, that is radiated from the initial or intermediate
state. For the s-channel SiMs discussed above, only initial-state radiation is permitted; see
ﬁgs. 1a and 1b for examples. For the tS model, radiation of a gluon or electroweak (EW)
boson is permitted both from initial state partons (ﬁg. 1c) or from the mediator (ﬁg. 1d).
The most likely scenario at the LHC is the production of a jet alongside the invisible
χ pair, as a result of the strong coupling and prevalence of partons in the initial state.
However, to fully exploit the potential of the ATLAS detector to record and identify a vast
array of particle types, we also consider two additional channels. Firstly, we take advantage
of the relative cleanliness and simplicity of leptons in the leptonically-decaying mono-Z
(→ (cid:96)+(cid:96)−) channel. We also take advantage of the large hadronic branching fraction,
and developing jet-identiﬁcation techniques for boosted EW bosons, in the hadronically-

In both cases, the large multi-jet background is
reduced, and complications in jet production such as parton-matching can be ignored,
making these an interesting alternative to the mono-jet channel where speed, eﬃciency
and a reduction in jet-associated uncertainties may make up for a loss in sensitivity.

2.3 Mass and coupling points

A representative set of dark matter and mediator masses, listed in table 1, are chosen for
study in each detection channel. DM masses of 3, 30 and 300 GeV are also included in
the mono-Z(lep) channel, where ease of production permits higher granularity in the mass
phase space. All (mχ, Mmed) combinations are allowed in the sV and sA models, while in
the tS model Mmed must be greater than mχ to ensure stability of the DM particle. The
couplings gq and gqχ are set to unity, while the DM-mediator coupling in the s-channel
models, gχ, is varied from 0.2 to 5. The mediator masses are chosen to cover a broad range
of parameter space and to coincide with predominantly three regimes: (near-)degenerate
(Mmed ≈ mχ), on-shell (Mmed ≥ 2mχ) and oﬀ-shell (Mmed < 2mχ). Note that these
diagrams do not comprise a comprehensive set.

3In addition, one of the ﬁrst Run II dark matter search results from ATLAS was from this channel [56],

released during the preparation of this paper.

(Mmed ≥ 2mχ) and oﬀ-shell (Mmed < 2mχ). For the t-channel model, Mmed > mχ is
required to ensure stability of the DM particle.

2.4 Treatment of the width

An important factor when considering SiMs is to ensure that the mediator width is treated
appropriately, as it impacts both the cross-section calculation and, in some cases, the
kinematic behaviour of the model.

Following the DM Forum recommendations [22], we use the minimal width, allowing
coupling to all kinematically accessible quarks. We assume minimal ﬂavour violation, which
implies a universal coupling to all quark ﬂavours. The minimum width for each model is
given by4:

We can take advantage of the fact that for each point in (mχ, Mmed) phase space,
the mediator width (and therefore the couplings) do not greatly aﬀect a model’s kinematic

4It is possible that the mediator may decay to other SM or BSM particles [23], but this is not expected

to have a large eﬀect on the kinematic distribution as long as the width remains relatively small [22].

behaviour (with the notable exception of the tS model in the mono-jet channel). This is
demonstrated in ﬁg. 2, where we plot a simpliﬁed Emiss
distribution (as a proxy for the full
selection in each analysis) for the sV (representing both the sV and sA models) and tS
models for two mass points and a demonstrative set of couplings such that Γ < Mmed/2.
The Emiss
distribution is predominantly independent of the mediator width for the s-
channel models in the mono-jet channel, and all models in the mono-Z(lep) 5 channel.
However, there is a clear variation in the kinematic behaviour of the tS model in the mono-
jet channel, which can be attributed to additional diagrams (accessible only in this channel)
featuring a gluon in the initial state and subsequently allowing the mediator to go on-shell.
In this scenario, when the resulting quark and DM particle are both small compared to the
mediator mass, they share equally its energy leading to a peak in the Emiss
distribution at
approximately half the mediator mass.

T

In the cases where the kinematic distribution is independent of the width, we assume
that the impact of the selection cuts in each channel is unchanged by the couplings. In
this case, the following relations approximately hold:

in the sV and sA models [44], and

in the tS model. When valid, these approximations allow us to greatly simplify our limit
calculations, and for this reason, we restrict our primary results to regions of parameter
space where Γ/Mmed < 0.5 (see app. A for further details of the limit-setting calculation).
The generator treatment of the mediator as a Breit-Wigner propagator, rather than a
true kinetic propagator, breaks down for large widths [36, 44]. More problematically, it was
noted by refs. [36, 44] that the Breit-Wigner propagator breaks down in the mDM (cid:29) Mmed
region even if Γ/Mmed is small. To correct for this we follow ref. [44], and rescale the
cross-section in the mDM > Mmed region by a factor which takes into account the error
introduced by the use of a Breit-Wigner propagator by the generator. The factor is found
by convolving the PDF with both the kinetic and Breit-Wigner propagators in turn and
taking the ratio at each mass point. We approximate the kinetic propagator by making
the substitution MmedΓ(Mmed) → sΓ(

s)/Mmed in the Breit-Wigner propagator.

√

A full study of the tS model within the mono-jet channel, where altering the coupling
can lead to changed kinematic behaviour, has been performed elsewhere [52], and requires
the production of individual samples for each coupling point. This, combined with the
challenges associated with including diﬀering orders of αs, make the generation process
computationally expensive compared to the mono-Z(lep) and mono-W/Z(had) channels.
We therefore exclude an analysis of the tS model in the mono-jet channel in this work.

5In this discussion, the mono-W/Z(had) channel can be assumed to follow the same logic as for the

mono-Z(lep) channel.

Z(lep) channels, for some exemplary masses. The parameter µ is deﬁned as Γ/Mmed, and is
used to demonstrate the impact of a changing width; the tS model in the mono-jet channel
shows a clear width-dependence. The widths are obtained with couplings of 0.1, 1 and 5
where µ < 0.5 remains true.

3 Recasting mono-X constraints

The procedure for recasting existing mono-X analyses to obtain SiM constraints follows a
simple cut-and-count methodology. Firstly, signal events are simulated (described below
in section 3.1) with object pT smearing applied to approximate the detection eﬃciency of
the ATLAS detector, . The event selection criteria of the mono-X analysis of interest
is then applied to the simulated signal samples. Events surviving the selection criteria
are counted to determine the likelihood of a dark matter event being observed (referred
to as the acceptance, A), which is then used in combination with channel-speciﬁc model-
independent limits on new physics events to limit the parameter space of a given model.
For a comprehensive description of the recasting procedure, see appendix A.

In this paper, mono-jet constraints are derived from a search for new phenomena

[57]. Similarly, the leptonic mono-Z and hadronic mono-W/Z constraints are derived
from ATLAS dark matter searches that were optimised for the D1, D5 and D9 eﬀective
operators [58, 59]. These analyses are described in further detail in sections 3.2, 3.3 and
3.4 respectively.

3.1 Signal simulation

(cid:113)

m2 + p2

Monte Carlo simulated event samples are used to model the expected signal for each channel
and for each SiM. Leading order matrix elements for the process pp → X + χ ¯χ (where
X is speciﬁcally one or two jets6, a Z(→ (cid:96)+(cid:96)−) boson or a W/Z(→ jj) boson) are ﬁrst
simulated using MADGRAPH5 aMC@NLO v2.2.2 [60] with the MSTW2008lo68cl PDF [61].
During this stage, the renormalisation and factorisation scales are set to the default sum
of
T for all particles in the ﬁnal state. Showering and hadronisation are then
performed by PYTHIA 8.201 [62] with the appropriate PDF and using the ATLAS UE
Tune AU2-MSTW2008LO [63]. Reconstruction of small-radius jets (hereon referred to
just as ‘jets’) for the mono-jet channel is performed by FASTJET [64] using the anti-kT
algorithm with radius parameter R = 0.4. Similarly, reconstruction of large-radius jets for
the mono-W/Z(had) channel is performed using the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm with R
= 1.2. The latter channel also includes a mass-drop ﬁltering procedure with µ = 0.67 and
√
y7 = 0.4 (see ref. [65] for further details), which favours large-R jets with two balanced
subjets, consistent with the decay of an EW boson to a (potentially boosted) dijet pair.
Lastly, the detector response is approximated by applying a Gaussian smearing factor to
the pT of all leptons and jets.

3.1.1 Parton matching scheme

In the ATLAS mono-jet analysis, matching of partons generated in MADGRAPH5 to jets
generated in PYTHIA 8 is performed using the MLM scheme [66], with two matching scales,
or values of ‘QCUT’, per mass/coupling point. In combination, the QCUT values span a
broad kinematic range with a cut placed on the leading jet pT per event to avoid double-
counting. This treatment aims to mitigate the impact of the matching scale on the shape
of the pT and Emiss
distributions; that is, to reduce the uncertainty in those areas of phase
space where the transferred momentum is signiﬁcantly larger or smaller that the QCUT
value. For the analysis of SiMs in this work, we use instead a single matching scale of
80 GeV. Though not ideal, this approach suitably reproduces the results of the ATLAS
mono-jet analysis for the masses of interest (see sec. B.1).
Importantly, it also reduces
the complexity and computational expense involved in estimating limits for the mono-jet
channel.

We now move to a discussion of each of the mono-X channels separately.

3.2 Mono-jet constraints

The ATLAS mono-jet + Emiss
analysis [57] was originally designed to set limits on three
new physics scenarios, the most relevant of which is the production of WIMP DM within

the context of a set of eﬀective operators. The analysis also includes a brief study of a Z(cid:48)
DM model which is analogous to our sV model.

Signal selection is carried out based on at least one hard jet recoiling against missing
energy. To ensure that the correct back-to-back jet + Emiss
topology is selected events are
required to have a leading jet, j1, with pT > 120 GeV and |η| < 2.0 satisfying pj1
T >
0.5. Surviving events must then fulﬁll |∆φ(j, (cid:126)Emiss
T )| > 1.0, where j is any jet with pT >
30 GeV and |η| < 4.5. This criterion reduces the multijet background contribution where
the large Emiss
originates mainly from jet energy mismeasurements. Note that there is no
upper limit placed on the number of jets per event. The contribution from the dominant
background processes, W/Z+jets, is managed with a veto on events containing muons or
electrons with pT > 7 GeV. Lastly, nine separate signal regions are deﬁned with increasing
lower thresholds on Emiss

T , which range from 150 GeV to 700 GeV as shown in table 2.

The ATLAS mono-jet analysis revealed no signiﬁcant deviation of observed events
from the expected SM backgrounds in the 8 TeV dataset of Run I. Subsequently, model-
independent limits on new physics signatures were provided in terms of the visible cross-
section, σ × A × ; these are listed in table 2.

The signal simulation procedure outlined in sec. 3.1 and implementation of the selec-
tion criteria discussed above were validated for the mono-jet channel via reproduction of
√
ATLAS limits on the suppression scale, M(cid:63) ≡ Mmed/
gqgχ, for the Z(cid:48) model. The details
of this process are contained in appendix B.1. Importantly, we observe agreement within
∼12% for all samples.

3.3 Mono-Z(lep) constraints

The ATLAS mono-Z(lep) + Emiss
analysis [58] was principally designed to constrain a set
of EFT models of DM. As a secondary focus, it also included a short study of a t-channel
SiM similar to our tS model.

T

– 10 –

The selection criteria for this analysis are summarised as follows (see the paper for a
full description). Electrons (muons) are required to have a pT greater than 20 GeV, and
|η| less than 2.47 (2.5). Two opposite-sign, same-ﬂavour leptons are selected, and required
to have invariant mass and pseudorapidity such that m(cid:96)(cid:96) ∈ [76, 106] GeV and |η(cid:96)(cid:96)| < 2.5.
The reconstructed Z boson should be approximately back-to-back and balanced against
the Emiss
T < 0.5.
Events containing a jet with pT > 25 GeV and |η| < 2.5 are vetoed. Events are also vetoed
if they contain a third lepton with pT > 7 GeV. The signal regions are deﬁned by increasing
lower Emiss

T

A cut-and-count strategy is used to estimate the total observed yields and expected SM
backgrounds in each signal region. The limits on σ×A×  are not publicly available, so we
take the numbers of expected and observed events, along with the associated uncertainties,
and convert these into model-dependent upper limits with a single implementation of the
HistFitter framework [67] using a frequentist calculator and a one-sided proﬁle likelihood
test statistic (the LHC default). The results of this process are displayed in table 3. Note
that we use signal regions 1 and 2 only, as our simpliﬁed HistFitter approach is inadequate
to handle the very low statistics of signal regions 3 and 4. These upper limits are also
used for the validation of the mono-Z(lep) signal generation and selection procedures (see
app. B.2).

3.4 Mono-W/Z(had) constraints

T

The ATLAS mono-W/Z(had) + Emiss
search [59] was aimed at constraining the spin-
independent eﬀective operators C1, D1, and D5, and the spin-dependent operator D9.
The search was originally designed to exploit what was thought to be the constructive
interference of W boson emission from opposite-sign up-type and down-type quarks, leading
to DM production wherein the mono-W channel is dominant. Recent studies [68] have
revealed this scenario to violate gauge invariance and so we ignore it in this analysis.

The mono-W/Z(had) event selection is carried out as follows. Large-radius jets are
selected using a mass-drop ﬁltering procedure (see sec. 3.1) to suppress non-W/Z processes.
Events are required to contain at least one large-R jet with pT > 250 GeV, |η| < 1.2 and
a mass, mjet, within a 30-40 GeV window of the W/Z mass (i.e. mjet ∈ [50, 120] GeV).
In order to reduce the t¯t and multijet backgrounds, a veto removes events containing a
small-R jet with ∆φ(jet, Emiss
T ) < 0.4, or containing more than one small-R jet with pT >

– 11 –

40 GeV, |η| < 4.5, and ∆R(small-R jet, large-R jet)> 0.9. Electrons, muons and photons
are vetoed if their pT is larger than 10 GeV and they lie within |η| < 2.47 (electrons),
2.5 (muons), 2.37 (photons). Two signal regions are deﬁned with Emiss
T > 350 GeV and
Emiss

T > 500 GeV.

The ATLAS analysis used a shape-ﬁt of the mass distribution of the large-R jet to es-
timate the background yields in the two signal regions, along with the associated statistical
and systematic uncertainties. As in the mono-Z(lep) case, we do not take the shapes into
account but convert the published number of SM background and observed data events
into upper limits on the expected and observed number of new physics events using the
HistFitter framework. For the Emiss
T > 500 GeV signal region, we obtain the limits shown
in table 4. We do not consider the ﬁrst signal region with Emiss
T > 350 GeV in the recasting
procedure, since the cut-and-count limits extracted could not be convincingly validated.
The high Emiss
signal region was found to be optimal for most operators studied by the
ATLAS analysis.

4 Results and discussion

4.1 Limits on the couplings

√

gqgχ

The 95% conﬁdence level upper limits on the sV and sA model coupling combination
√
gqgχ, and the tS model coupling gqχ, obtained from each of the mono-X channels, are
presented in ﬁgs. 3-8. These quantities were evaluated as described in appendix A (in-
cluding statistical and systematic uncertainties), and correspond to the best limits of each
signal region tested.

In each plot, limits are shown ranging from <0.01 to the upper perturbative limit8 for
each coupling, 4π; where a limit was calculated to be larger than this, the limit is considered
meaningless and the region is coloured grey. The white (hatched) regions coincide with
those mass points which yield an initial (ﬁnal) value of
gqgχ or gqχ which fails to satisfy
Γ < Mmed/2. (We observe that values for which the width is just within our upper validity
bound of Mmed/2 may be pushed over into the invalid range with the addition of new
particles, not considered here, which would serve to increase the mediator width.) When
gχ/gq = 0.2, only the mono-jet channel produces limits which survive this requirement,
and so these are shown separately in ﬁg 7.

√

8We note that perturbativity is questionable for couplings greater than ∼ 2 − 3, however 4π is an

oft-quoted hard upper limit.

Detailed comments speciﬁc to each channel are provided below, however some trends
are channel-independent. For the sV model, strong limits exist when Mmed > 2mχ as the
mediator can go on-shell, thereby enhancing the cross-section. The sA model limits are
generally similar to the sV model limits except in the region corresponding to mDM (cid:38)
√
4πMmed/ggen
is the DM coupling used at the generator level. We remove
this region in the sA model to avoid violating perturbative unitarity, which can lead to
an unphysical enhancement of the cross-section when the DM mass is much larger than
the mediator mass [45, 46]. The upper limit on
gqgχ is relatively constant across values
of gχ/gq, as is expected when the coupling (and hence the width) has been demonstrated
to have little eﬀect on kinematic behaviour (see sec 2.4), and using the assumptions of
eq. 2.7. As the ratio increases, points in the region Mmed > mχ disappear as the initial
value, gq = 1, leads to a failure of the width condition. However, one could easily choose
a smaller initial value of gq to recover these points, and we suggest that the limits in this
region would be quite similar to those seen in the gχ/gq = 0.2 and 0.5 cases.

√

T

The constraints on the coupling strength are weaker when mχ or Mmed is large (>100
GeV) owing to suppression of the cross-section. In this region, the constraints are expected
to improve at higher centre-of-mass energies. For small DM masses with an oﬀ-shell me-
diator, the Emiss
distribution is softer, therefore results in this region of phase space are
limited by statistical uncertainties associated with the tail-end of the distribution. This
region of phase space would beneﬁt from further optimisation of event selection in analyses
aimed at the study of simpliﬁed models, as we expect to see in the upcoming Run II results.
These mono-X searches are complementary to direct searches for the mediator via dijet
resonances [69–72]. These have been used to study SiMs in, for example, [36, 46, 52]. Dijet
studies search for the signature of a direct mediator decay into standard model particles,
generally assuming a narrow resonance. These constraints can be stronger than mono-X
constraints, particularly when the width is small and when the coupling to quarks is large
relative to the coupling to DM. Mono-X searches however have the advantage for larger
values of gχ/gq and smaller mediator masses.
We now examine channel-speciﬁc trends.

4.1.1 Mono-jet channel

√

The mono-jet channel upper limits on the coupling combination
gqgχ for the sV and
sA models are displayed in the left-hand column of ﬁgs. 3-6, for gχ/gq = 0.5, 1, 2 and
5 respectively (where the ratio of 5 is only shown for the sV model, due to a lack of
meaningful results in the sA model). The gχ/gq = 0.2 case is shown separately in ﬁg. 7, as
these limits are only meaningful within this channel.

As expected, the mono-jet channel produces the strongest coupling limits for both
s-channel models, which are better than those from the next-best mono-Z(lep) channel
by a factor of a few. For these models, the weakest limits result for large mχ or large
Mmed, and in fact are so weak that they are pushed into the region of invalidity where
Γ > Mmed/2. Although the acceptance is considerably higher when both mDM and Mmed
are large compared to low masses, the cross-section is suﬃciently small so as to nullify any
gain. Within the valid region (mχ ∈ [1, 100] GeV and Mmed ∈ [1, 200] GeV), the limit

– 13 –

√

on
gqgχ generally ranges from 0.1 to 0.7, with a handful of on-shell masses reaching a
limit of ∼0.05 in the large gχ/gq case. In the large gχ/gq scenario, limits for mχ = 1000
gqgχ remains constant but gχ/gq increases, the value
GeV start to become valid; where
of gq is pushed downward and so the width, which is dominated by decays to SM particles,
decreases with respect to mDM.

√

The uncertainties on the limits for both s-channel models are dominated by contri-
butions from the matching scale at acceptance-level, and generally range from ∼ 5% to
46%.

4.1.2 Mono-Z(lep) channel

The simplicity of the mono-Z(lep) channel relative to the mono-jet channel, and the ease
of signal simulation at MADGRAPH5 level allowed us to study a ﬁner granularity of points
in the mass phase space. The resulting limits on the sV and sA models are shown in the
central column of ﬁgs. 3-6. While the behaviour of the limits as gχ/gq is varied is similar
to that within the mono-jet channel, the mono-Z(lep) limits are overall weaker by a factor
of a few.

The total relative uncertainties on

gqgχ for the s-channel models are generally within
10%, but can range up to 80% in a few cases where mχ is small; they are in general split
equally between statistical and systematic contributions.

√

The advantage of the mono-boson channels is in the study of the tS model; since this
was not included in the mono-jet channel the strongest limits are obtained with the mono-
Z(lep) analysis, and are shown in the left-hand side of ﬁg. 8. Note that, in comparison to
the s-channel models, the limits have weakened by a factor of 10. This is the result of an
orders-of-magnitude weaker cross-section and the inability of the mediator to go on-shell
in this channel. We ﬁnd stronger limits for smaller mχ and Mmed masses, where larger
cross-sections compensate for lower acceptances at these points. Overall, the uncertainties
contribute less than 10%.

4.1.3 Mono-W/Z(had) channel

The limits on the couplings of the sV , sA and tS models, obtained within the mono-
W/Z(had) channel, are shown in the right-hand column of ﬁgs. 3-8. This channel was
included for comparison with the leptonic mono-Z(lep) channel in particular, but a coarser
selection of masses was chosen as the limits were initially found to be somewhat weaker.
Additionally, further estimates were made: a) as the kinematic behaviour is reasonably
independent of the couplings, a single acceptance was found for each (mχ, Mmed) combi-
nation and applied to each value of gχ/gq, and b) complete systematic uncertainties were
generated for a subset of masses and compared to those from the mono-Z(lep) channel; from
this comparison the mono-Z(lep) systematic uncertainties were multiplied by 2 and then
applied to the mono-W/Z(had) limits. As a result, the limits obtained in this channel are
not intended to be rigorously quantitative; rather, they are used to indicate qualitatively
how the channel compares.

The ATLAS mono-W/Z(had) analysis (and in particular the higher Emiss

signal re-
gion) was not optimised for a SiM interpretation, and much of the phase space produced

T

– 14 –

insigniﬁcant numbers of events passing the event selection, with up to 200 thousand events
generated. Generally, the limits are a factor of a few weaker than those from the mono-
Z(lep) channel, which is both consistent with the limits on the EFT models studied in the
ATLAS analyses, and expected following our use of a cut-and-count interpretation, rather
than a shape analysis, of the mono-W/Z(had) public results.

In some cases the limits become comparable with the mono-Z(lep) channel, suggesting
that more statistics and an improved treatment of systematic uncertainties would bring
these closer in line with that channel.

Overall, the uncertainties from this channel lie within 5 to 50%, most of the time being
between 10 and 30%. Generally, both statistical and systematic uncertainties contribute
in a similar manner. A few points are clearly limited by the generated statistics, resulting
in a statistical error of up to 90%. Points with high mχ and low Mmed tend to have larger
systematic uncertainties.

4.2 Comparison with relic density constraints

In ﬁgs. 3-8 we show lines where the constraint on the coupling corresponds to the coupling
strength that would reproduce the correct DM relic density if DM is a thermal relic of the
early universe. For points diagonally above and to the left of the solid purple line, the
LHC constraints naively rule out the couplings leading to the correct relic density. Below
and to the right of this line the relic density coupling is still allowed. In some cases the
intercept does not pass through a signiﬁcant number of data points surviving the quality
criteria outlined in previous sections. In these cases the line is not shown.

In this scenario, the measured abundance is approximately related to the unknown

self-annihilation cross-section via:

ΩDMh2 (cid:39) 2 × 2.4 × 10−10 GeV−2

(cid:104)σv(cid:105)ann

.

(4.1)

DMh2 = 0.1199 ±
This is used with measurements of the DM abundance by Planck, Ωobs
0.0027 [73], to ﬁnd (cid:104)σv(cid:105)ann (cid:39) 4.0 × 10−9 GeV−2 for thermal relic DM. This relation is
only approximately accurate, and so we use the micrOMEGAs code [74] to determine the
coupling strength leading to the correct relic density for each model. This technique was
veriﬁed against the semi-analytic technique outlined in e.g. ref. [75].

If the DM mass lies at the electroweak scale, the thermal relic scenario provides a
natural explanation for the observed DM density. The coupling strengths leading to the
correct relic density are therefore a natural benchmark with which to compare constraints
from collider (and indeed direct detection) searches. However the relic density couplings
should by no means be regarded as serious constraints. If DM is not produced thermally or
there is an unknown eﬀect which modiﬁes the evolution of the density with temperature,
then eq. 4.1 breaks down. Additionally, in the scenario where we assume DM to be a
thermal relic, we ignore the possibility of there being other annihilation channels and other
beyond-SM particles contributing to the DM abundance, which, if taken into account,
would also invalidate eq. 4.1.

– 15 –

4.3 Comparison with direct detection constraints

In ﬁgs 3-8 we also show the intercept line where constraints from direct detection exper-
iments are equivalent to our mono-X constraints. Below and to the right of the dashed
purple line, direct detection constraints are stronger while above and to the left of this line,
the LHC gives the stronger limit. As with the relic density contours, we do not show the
intercept where it does not pass through suﬃcient valid data points. We use the toolset
from ref. [76] to convert the strongest available direct detection constraints, which are from
the LUX 2013 dataset [77], onto constraints on our models.

Compared to direct detection, the mono-X collider limits perform relatively better
for the sA model than for the sV model. This is because the axial-vector coupling leads
to a suppressed scattering rate in direct detection experiments while collider searches are
relatively insensitive to the diﬀerence between the vector and axial-vector couplings. In
the non-relativistic limit, the tS model leads to a mix of both suppressed and unsuppressed
operators.

The direct detection constraints assume that the DM candidate under consideration
contributes 100% of the local DM density, while the mono-X constraints make no assump-
tions about either the local DM density or overall abundance. In this sense the mono-X
limits remain useful even in those regions of phase space where they are not as strong as
those from direct detection.

5 Conclusion

In this paper we have examined a set of three simpliﬁed dark matter models, extracting
constraints from ATLAS Run I mono-X plus missing energy searches featuring the as-
sociated production of a mono-jet, mono-Z(→ leptons), or mono-W/Z(→ hadrons). We
explored a phase space where both the DM and mediator masses span O(GeV) to O(TeV),
and considered ratios of gχ/gq of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 in the s-channel models.

Rather than setting limits in the Mmed − mDM plane for a ﬁxed value of the coupling
strength, we instead constrained the coupling strength as a function of both Mmed and mDM
in a 3D plane. Whilst this approach necessitates the introduction of some approximations,
it also allows for a thorough examination of the interplay between the DM production
cross-section and the free parameters of the models.

As expected, the mono-jet channel is found to yield the strongest limits on vector
and axial-vector SM and DM couplings to a vector mediator exchanged in the s-channel.
This channel is also found to perform well for small values of gχ. The limits obtained
in the mono-Z(lep) channel, in comparison, are generally weaker by a factor of a few,
while the mono-W/Z(had) results are weaker again. This is partly due to our conservative
estimations of the systematic uncertainties and partly due to limited statistics resulting
from a harder Emiss
selection cut. The width eﬀects associated with the t-channel exchange
of an SU(2) doublet scalar mediator are observed to vanish in both the mono-Z(lep) and
mono-W/Z(had) channels, greatly simplifying the analysis of this model and conﬁrming
these as straightforward and competitive channels for future collider DM detection.

we ﬁnd the coupling limits to be on par with those of the vector model within each anal-
ysis channel. Weaker limits are found for the t-channel model, a result of cross-section
suppression not present in the s-channel models.

Finally, we compared our limits to constraints from relic density and direct detection;
although each search is subject to a diﬀerent set of assumptions, this demonstrates the
complementarity and impressive reach of simpliﬁed models as a tool for the interpretation
of collider DM searches. We eagerly await the improved constraints expected from Run II
of the LHC.

A Limit setting strategy

In this appendix we present a summary of the procedure employed to calculate the 95%
conﬁdence level (CL) limits on the coupling parameter
gqgχ, where this parameter can
be replaced with gqχ for the tS model, and M(cid:63) in the validation of the mono-jet analysis.

√

A.1 Nominal values

For each SiM, the nominal limit is calculated by taking the model-independent upper limit
on σ×A× from each analysis, dividing by the value of A× coming from signal MC (which
is taken as a single parameter for each point) to obtain the limiting cross section σlim, and
rearranging eq. 2.7 to convert to a limit on the couplings. In the s-channel on-shell case,
the width can be expressed as a function of gq and the ratio gχ/gq, which simpliﬁes the
calculation. We arrive at

and σgen are the input couplings and cross-section (taken from PYTHIA 8),

The signal region in each case is chosen based on where the best ‘expected’ limit
lies, where that limit is calculated assuming that exactly the expected SM background is
observed.

A.2 Uncertainty estimation
Our nominal limits rely on both σgen and A× and so are subject to systematic uncertainties
which derive from our choice of signal generation procedure. For our signal samples, there
are three key sources of systematic uncertainty: the factorisation and renormalisation
scales, the strong coupling constant (αs) and the choice of parton distribution function
(PDF).

We assess the impact of the factorisation and renormalisation default scales in a
straightforward manner; by varying them simultaneously by factors of 2 (‘up’) and 0.5
(‘down’). The systematic eﬀects of the strong coupling constant and PDF are diﬃcult to
separate and so are treated in tandem. We assume that the systematic uncertainty intro-
duced by αs at matrix-element level is negligible when compared to the PDF uncertainties,
as demonstrated to be valid in ref. [78]. The variation of αs in conjunction with a change
of PDF is done with the use of speciﬁc tunes in PYTHIA 8, which we change simultaneously
with the PDF choice to estimate the uncertainty on ∆σgen. The nominal choices of PDF

PDF and ATLAS UE AU2-CTEQ6L1 tune. For the mono-jet channel, the impact of the
matching scale (QCUT) is assessed in a manner similar to that of the factorisation and
renormalisation scales. That is, we vary the QCUT by factors of 2 (‘up’ to 160 GeV) and
0.5 (‘down’ to 40 GeV). These systematic uncertainty sources are summarised in table 5.

Table 5: Reading left to right, the sources of systematic uncertainty considered in this
analysis. Each point in phase space is varied up or down by one of these sources, and
the systematic uncertainty is then taken from the resultant changes to the acceptance and
cross-section in comparison to their nominal values.

The average variation in the nominal value of σlim (measured as a fraction of σlim)
resulting from each systematic source is added in quadrature and propagated to
gqgχ to
obtain the total systematic uncertainty. This process is adjusted slightly to account for
the inclusion of statistical uncertainties, which are estimated conservatively by taking the

(A × ) − ∆(A × ). Note that the uncertainty on the luminosity is less than 3%, so is
considered to be negligible in comparison to other systematic sources.

B Validation of signal simulation and event selection procedures

B.1 Mono-jet channel

√

The signal generation and selection procedures for the mono-jet channel are validated via
√
reproduction of the ATLAS limits on M(cid:63) ≡ Mmed/
gqgχ, for the s-channel vector SiM.
A comparison of SR79 limits for a representative sample of mediator masses with mχ =
50 GeV, Γ = M/8π and
gqgχ = 1 is presented in table 6. In general, good agreement
is observed between the ATLAS and reproduced limits, with a maximum diﬀerence of
12%. We note that a discrepancy of a few percent is expected given the diﬀerences in
signal simulation. For example, the simpliﬁed matching procedure discussed in detail
in Sec 3.1.1 introduces an additional uncertainty of approximately 25% for events with
Emiss
T > 350 GeV when compared to the approach utilised by the ATLAS mono-jet group.
Further uncertainties are introduced by the jet smearing approximation used in place of
a full detector simulation and by the 95% CL estimation procedure (outlined in app. A)
used instead of a thorough HistFitter treatment. As our results are consistently more
conservative than those of the ATLAS analysis, we consider our approach to be acceptable.

B.2 Mono-Z(lep) channel

The ATLAS mono-Z(lep) results include an upper limit on the coupling gqχ for a t-channel
SiM analogous to our tS model, and so it is this model which we use to validate our signal

9We use this signal region as it is the only one for which ATLAS limits are provided.

generation and selection procedures. Note that the following diﬀerences exist: the ATLAS
model includes just two mediators (up- and down-type) where we consider six, the DM
particle is taken to be Majorana where we assume Dirac, and the couplings gt,bχ are set to
zero where we have universal coupling to all three quark generations.

Table 7 shows the 95% CL upper limits on gqχ that we calculate using our own gen-
eration procedure (and the values in table 3), compared with the limits taken from the
ATLAS analysis. Also shown is the diﬀerence as a percentage of the ATLAS limit. We
see reasonable agreement; most of the 11 points in parameter space are within 10% of
the ATLAS limits, and all are within 26%. Additionally, our results are consistently more
conservative, which again is to be expected given the less sophisticated nature of our gen-
eration procedure. As in the case of the mono-jet validation, the diﬀerences stem from the
use of pT smearing applied to the leptons (rather than a full reconstruction simulation)
and from the simpliﬁed treatment of systematics; we also obtained σ×A×  independently
using the public results.

B.3 Mono-W/Z(had) channel

The event generation and selection procedures for the mono-W/Z(had) channel are vali-
dated via reproduction of the ATLAS limits on M(cid:63) for the D5 and D9 eﬀective operators
with mχ = 1 GeV. We see agreement within 12.5% and 7.4% respectively, where the ATLAS
limits are consistently stronger, as shown in table B.3. The relative sizes of the discrepan-
cies are expected given that only low-Emiss
limits are available for the D5 operator while
we use the high-Emiss
signal region in our recast. Note that a general discrepancy of a few
percent is expected for both operators for the reasons discussed in sections B.1 and B.2,

and also because we use a cut-and-count approach while the ATLAS limits are extracted
using a shape-ﬁt. Furthermore, the ATLAS limits are quoted at 90% CL while ours are
calculated at 95% CL.
