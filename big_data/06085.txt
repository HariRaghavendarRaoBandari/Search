TOEPLITZ OPERATORS ON WEIGHTED HARMONIC BERGMAN

SPACES

ZIPENG WANG AND XIANFENG ZHAO

Abstract. In this paper, we study Toeplitz operators on the weighted harmonic
Bergman spaces with nonnegative symbols, the weights we choose here are Mucken-
houpt A2 weights. Results obtained include characterizations of bounded Toeplitz
operators, compact Toeplitz operators, invertible Toeplitz operators and Toeplitz
operators in the Schatten classes.

1. Introduction

Let 1 6 p < ∞ and ω be a nonnegative integrable function on the unit disk D.

Lp(ω) denotes the Banach space with norm

kfkLp(ω) :=(cid:18)ZD |f (z)|pω(z)dA(z)(cid:19) 1

p

.

The weighted harmonic (analytic) Bergman space Lp
a(ω)) is the subspace
of Lp(ω) which is consisting of harmonic (analytic) functions on D. The goal of
this paper is to provide a framework to study operator properties (boundedness,
compactness, Schatten classes and inveritibility) of Toeplitz operators on L2
h(ω) with
nonnegative symbols.

h(ω) (Lp

weight is a radial function satisfying the doubling propertyR 1

Weighted analytic function spaces and their Toeplitz operators have captured peo-
ple’s attentions for a long time. It is now well known ([24]) that several results on
unweighted Bergman space can be extended to the standard weighted Bergman space
L2
a(ωα), where ωα(z) = (1 + α)(1−|z|2)α and −1 < α < ∞. In recent papers [19] and
[20], Pel´aez and R¨atty¨a characterized the bounded and Schatten class Toeplitz oper-
ators (induced by a positive Borel measure) on a weighted Bergman space, here the
ω(s)ds.
The ﬁrst results of non-radial weighted Bergman space seems to be due to Luecking
([13]) who investigated the structure of weighted Bergman space with B´ekoll´e-Bonami
weight. Based on Luecking’s representation and duality theorems in [13], Chac´on ([2])
and Constantin ([5], [6]) studied the boundedness and compactness of Toeplitz oper-
ators on certain weighted Bergman spaces. In [17], Mitkovski and Wick established a
reproducing kernel thesis for operators on Bergman type space, and their deﬁnitions
include weighted versions of Bergman spaces on more complicated domains.

We will be primarily interested in weighted harmonic Bergman space L2

h(ω). Our
choice of the weight ω is motivated by the characterization of boundedness of Ph act-
ing on L2(ω), where Ph is the unweghted harmonic Bergman (orthogonal) projection
from L2(dA) to L2
h(dA) is a reproducing kernel Hilbert
space and

h(dA). It is well known that L2

(1 − zλ)2 − 1(cid:21)dA(λ).

Clearly, Ph is a Calder´on-Zygmund operator on the homogeneous space (D, d, dA),
where d is the Euclidean distance and dA is the Lebesgue area measure on D, normal-
ized so that the measure of D is 1. For the deﬁnitions of Calder´on-Zygmund operator
and homogeneous space, we refer to [1].

The most successful understanding of the (one) weight theory of Calder´on-Zgumund
operator was spurred by Munckenhoupt’s work in 1970s ([18]), which led to the in-
troduction of the class of Ap weight and developments of weighted inequality. We
will restrict our attentions to A2 weight on (D, d, dA).

Let 0 < ω ∈ L1(D, dA), it is called a Muckenhoupt A2 weight if
< +∞,

|B(a, r)|ω|B(a, r)|ω−1

[ω]A2 :=

a∈D, 0<r<1

|B(a, r)|2

where

B(a, r) = {z ∈ D : d(a, z) = |z − a| < r},

|B(a, r)|ω =ZB(a,r)

ω(z)dA(z)

and | · | is the normalized Lebesgue measure on D.
It follows form the remarkable A2 theorem ([1],[9]) that Ph is bounded from L2(ω) to
L2
h(ω) provided ω is a Muckenhoupt A2 weight. As mentioned above, we will focus on
the weighted harmonic Bergman space L2
h(ω) with ω ∈ A2. Little is known about this
nature function space. However, we will see in Section 2 that L2
h(ω) is a reproducing
kernel Hilbert space with the reproducing kernel K ω
z iL2(ω) for
all f in L2
For a positive ﬁnite Borel measure ν on D, we densely deﬁne the Toeplitz operator

z (λ), i.e., f (z) = hf, K ω

Tν on L2

h(ω) by

z(cid:11)L2(ω) =ZD

f (λ)K ω

(cid:0)z ∈ D(cid:1).

For a bounded function ϕ, using the integral representation for the projection operator
(from L2(ω) to L2
h(ω)) as the
following:

h(ω)), we can express the Toeplitz operator Tϕ (on L2

Tϕf (z) =ZD

(cid:0)z ∈ D(cid:1).

Although we follow Luecking’s methods in [13] and [14] for the weighted Bergman
spaces, some new diﬃculties arise in the study of the space L2
h(ω) and the corre-
sponding operators. For instance, harmonic functions do not share many powerful
tools with analytic functions. One can use the Cauchy formula to estimate the local
values of analytic functions easily. However, because of the tedious remainder, the
harmonic version Cauchy formula (known as Cauchy-Pompeiu formula) is not valid

now. We instead must rely on some known estimations on harmonic functions. In
addition, just as the weighted Bergman space, one cannot write down an explicit for-
mula for the reproducing kernel for L2
h(ω). To overcome this obstacle, we will use the
reproducing kernel for the unweighted space L2
h to help us study the representation
theory of L2
h are much more
complicated than that of Bergman space L2
a.

h(ω). However, the properties of reproducing kernel for L2

Using some properties of harmonic functions and A2 weights, we establish two
h(ω) (Theorems 2.4 and 2.10), which

diﬀerent atomic decompositions for functions in L2
extend the representation theorems in [13] to the harmonic case.

In Section 3, we characterize the boundedness, compactness and Schatten p class of
Toeplitz operators Tν on L2
h(ω) by means of Berezin transform and Carleson measure.
We are pleasure to mention here that Miao ([15]) have obtained characterizations for
the Toeplitz operators with nonnegative symbols to be bounded, compact and in
Schatten classes on unweighted harmonic Bergman space L2
h.

Section 4 of this paper is devoted to studying the invertibility of Toeplitz operators
on the standard weighted harmonic Bergman space L2
h(ωα). A little surprising to us,
the results illustrate that the invertibility of Toeplitz operators on Bergman space L2
a
can imply a reverse Carleson inequality for L2
h(ωα), see Theorems 4.2 and 4.4. Based
on this inequality, we generalize the result on the invertibility of Bergman Toeplitz
operators with nonnegative symbols ([23]) to the case of L2
h(ωα). As a consequence,
we obtain a relationship of the invertibility between Toeplitz operators with bounded
nonnegative symbols on L2

h(ωα), see Corollary 4.5.

a(ωα) and L2

In the ﬁnal section, we establish a reverse Carleson type inequality for L2

h(ω) with
ω ∈ A2. Indeed, we obtain a suﬃcient condition for χGdA to be a reverse Carleson
measure for L2
h(ω), where G is a measurable set in D, see Theorem 5.1, which extends
Theorem 3.9 for the weighted (analytic) Bergman space in [13] to the harmonic
setting.

Throughout the paper, positive constants will be explicitly denoted by C, C0, C1,· · · ,

which may depend on some ﬁxed numbers and change at each occurrence.

2. The Space L2

h(ω) and its Representation

In this section, we present some elementary structures of L2

h(ω) with ω ∈ A2. To
study the harmonic Bergman spaces, we need the following important properties of
harmonic functions.

Lemma 2.1. ([10]) Suppose that f is a harmonic function on the disk D and 0 <
p < ∞. There exists a positive constant C = C(p) such that for every ball B(a, r) =
{z ∈ D : |z − a| < r} in D,

|f (a)|p 6

C

|B(a, r)|ZB(a,r) |f (z)|pdA(z).

In particular, if p > 1, then the constant C ≡ 1. Using this result one can get the
following useful inequalities easily: given 0 < p < ∞ and 0 < r < 1, there exist
positive constants C1 = C1(p) and C2 = C2(p) such that

|f (a)|p 6

(cid:0)a ∈ D(cid:1)

are bounded linear functionals on L2
reproducing kernel Hilbert space.

Remark 1. From the above inequalities, it is easy to show that point evaluations
h(ω) is a

h(ω) with ω ∈ A2. As a consequence, L2
h(ω) is complete for a general weight. However,
if p is an analytic polynomial on D and ω(z) = |p(z)|2, Douglas and Wang [7] showed
that L2
a(ω) is complete, whose proof heavily depends on some particular properties
of polynomials.

Remark 2. It is not clear whether L2

It is clear that L2

h(ω) coincides with its dual space with respect to the L2(ω) inner
h(ω) can be identiﬁed
h(ω−1) via the unweighted inner product, which generalizes Luecking’s result

product. The next result illustrates that the dual space of L2
with L2
for L2
Lemma 2.2. Suppose that ω is an A2 weight. Then the dual space of L2
identiﬁed with L2

a(ω) (see Theorem 2.1 in [13]) to the setting of L2

h(ω−1). The pairing is given by

h(ω) can be

h(ω).

hf, gi =ZD

f (z)g(z)dA(z).

Consequently, there exists a bounded, bijective and linear operator F : L2
(L2

h(ω))∗ such that

h(ω−1) →

F (f )(g) = hg, fiL2(dA)

h(ω).

h(ω−1) and g ∈ L2

for f ∈ L2
Proof. Let ω be an A2 weight. Recall that orthogonal projection Ph : L2(dA) →
L2
h(dA) is a Calder´on-Zygmund operator on (D, d, dA). Then Ph is bounded on both
L2(ω) and L2(ω−1). Thus for each f ∈ L2(ω) and g ∈ L2(ω−1), we have

Note that each f ∈ L2

h(ω) (or f ∈ L2

h(ω−1)) has the following form:

hPhf, gi = hf, Phgi.

Let a ∈ D and 0 < r < 1. A pseudohyperbolic disk D(a, r) is deﬁned by

D(a, r) =(cid:26)z ∈ D : ρ(z, a) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

z − a

1 − az(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < r(cid:27).

We will frequently use the following property of A2 weights on pseudohyperbolic

disks. For the sake of complete, we include a proof of this fact as follows.

Lemma 2.3. Let 0 < r 6 1

4 and z ∈ D. If ξ ∈ D(z, r), then we have
|D(z, r)|ω < 8[ω]A2|D(ξ, r)|ω.

Proof. Observe that D(z, r) ⊂ D(ξ, 2r). Now it suﬃces to show the following dou-
bling inequality:

|D(ξ, 2r)|ω < 8[ω]A2|D(ξ, r)|ω

Since ω is an A2weight, we have

(cid:0)ξ ∈ D(cid:1).

|D(ξ, 2r)|ω|D(ξ, 2r)|ω−1

given by

C =

1 − |z|2
1 − r2|z|2 r.

where the last inequality is due to r 6 1

4. This completes the proof of Lemma 2.3. (cid:3)

We now turn to the representation theory of the space L2

h(ω). These results and
their proof strategies are motivated by Luecking’s works on weighted Bergman space
([13], [14]).

Before studying the representation theory of L2

of ǫ-lattice in the unit disk. Let ǫ ∈ (0, 1), a sequence {an}∞
called an ǫ-lattice in the pseudo-hyperbolic metric if

follows, we will use r0 to denote the constant provided in this remarks.
To prove Theorem 2.4, we need to establish a harmonic version of Luecking’s

theorems in [13] and [14].
Theorem 2.5. Let ω be an A2 weight. Then there exists an ǫ-lattice {an}∞

Once Theorem 2.5 is established, we can quickly present a proof of Theorem 2.4

as follows.

where δan is the Dirac measure concentrated at an. Indeed, the conclusion of Theorem

h(ω). Firstly,
we establish a suﬃcient condition for a general (positive) measure to be the Lp
h(ω)
Carleson measure, where 0 < p < ∞.
Proposition 2.6. Suppose that ν is a positive Borel measure on D. If there exist an

Theorem 3.1. Let ν be a positive ﬁnite Borel measure on D and ω be an A2 weight.
The following conditions are equivalent:
(1) Tν extends to a bounded linear operator on L2
(2) ν is a Carlseon measure for L2

(4) Berezin transform eν is bounded.

To prove Theorem 3.1, we need the following useful lemma.

(3) ⇒ (2): This was proved in Proposition 2.6.
(2) ⇒ (1): Assume that ν is a Carleson measure. By Condition (2) and Lemma
3.2, we obtain Condition (3). Now Proposition 2.6 implies that ν is also a Carleson

From the above theorem, it is natural to characterize the compactness of Tν via
vanishing Carleson measure. In fact, we will characterize the compact Toeplitz oper-
ators with positive measures as the symbols via not only vanishing Carlson measure
(for the A2 weighted harmonic Bergman space) but also Berezin transform.
Theorem 3.3. Let ν be a positive ﬁnite Borel measure on D and ω ∈ A2. The

the second integral as small as we like; Fix s0, it is easy to show the ﬁrst integral
converges to zero, since fn → 0 (n → ∞) uniformly on compact subsets. This proves

4. Invertibility of Toeplitz operators on L2

h(ωα)

A fundamental and interesting problem is to determine when a Toeplitz operator is
invertible on the Hardy or Bergman space. In this section, we study the invertibility
problem of Toeplitz operators on the standard weighted harmonic Bergman space
L2
h(ωα) with ωα = (1 + α)(1 − |z|2)α, α > −1. Recall that the reproducing kernel for
L2
h(ωα) is given by

z (λ) = K α

z (λ) + K α

where

K α

z (λ) =

z (λ) − 1 (cid:0)z, λ ∈ D(cid:1),

(1 − zλ)2+α

is the reproducing kernel for the weighted Bergman space L2

a(ωα), see [21] if needed.
For the (unweighted) Bergman space setting, the second author and Zheng pro-
vided a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the Toeplitz operators with nonnegative
symbols to be invertible on L2
a ([23]). The main tool used in [23] is Luecking’s result
on the reverse Carleson measure for Bergman space ([11]), which also holds for the
harmonic Bergman space. More precisely, Luecking established the following result.

Lemma 4.1. ([12]) Suppose that G is a measurable subset of D. Then the following
are equivalent:
(i) There exists a δ ∈ (0, 1) such that

|G ∩ K| > δ|D ∩ K|

for every ball K whose center lies on ∂D;
(ii) χGdA is a reverse Carleson measure for L2
C > 0 such that

h(ωα).

h(ωα). That is, there is a constant

Motivated by the ideas and techniques used in [23], we are able to characterize
h(ωα) in terms of the reverse

the invertiblility of Toeplitz operator Tϕ (ϕ > 0) on L2
Carleson measure and Berezin transform.

TOEPLITZ OPERATORS ON WEIGHTED HARMONIC BERGMAN SPACES

Theorem 4.2. Let ϕ > 0 be in L∞(ωα). The following conditions are equivalent:
(1) The Toeplitz operator Tϕ is invertible on L2

h(ωα);

(2) The Berezin transform eϕ is invertible in L∞(ωα), where

ZD |f (z)|2ϕ(z)ωα(z)dA(z) > CZD |f (z)|2ωα(z)dA(z)

for f ∈ L2

h(ωα).

Before giving the proof the main theorem of this section, we need another lemma,

which was proved in [12], [16] and [22].
Lemma 4.3. Suppose that the ball K has radius 0 < t < 1 and center u = (1, 0) ∈ R2.
Let f be the harmonic function

f (λ) = fs(λ) := √1 + αRα

z0(λ)(1 − |z0|2)

where z0 = (1 − st)u, 0 < s < 1. Then for each ǫ > 0, there exist s = s(ǫ) and a
positive constant C = C(ǫ) (independent of K) such that

if 0 6 α < ∞,
if − 1 < α < 0,

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 4.2.

Proof of Theorem 4.2. We will show that (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3) ⇒ (4) ⇒ (1). Without
loss of generality, we may assume that 0 6 ϕ 6 1.

(1) ⇒ (2): This is trivial.

Lemma 4.1, it suﬃcient to show that there exists a δ′ ∈ (0, 1) such that

(2) ⇒ (3): Suppose that eϕ is bounded below by some positive constant δ. By

|G ∩ K| > δ′|D ∩ K|

22

for all balls K whose centers lie on ∂D.

Since ωαdA is a rotation invariant measure, it is no loss of generality to assume
that K has its center at the point (1, 0). It is also clear that we need only to prove
the inequality for suﬃcient small radius t, say t < 1.
Now we consider the subset G = {λ ∈ D : ϕ(λ) > δ

the last inequality follows from the deﬁnition of the reverse Carleson measure.

h(ωα). This completes the

that kI − Tϕk < 1, which implies that Tϕ is invertible on L2
whole proof of the theorem.

Let Tϕ denote the Toeplitz operator with symbol ϕ on the weighted Bergman space
L2
a(ωα). Combining the main result in [11] and the techniques used in the proof of
Theorem 4.2, we can generalize Theorem 3.2 in [23] to the case of standard weighted
Bergman space.

Theorem 4.4. Let ϕ > 0 be in L∞(ωα). Then the following are equivalent:
(1) The Toeplitz operator Tϕ is invertible on L2

for f ∈ L2

24

ZIPENG WANG AND XIANFENG ZHAO

Proof. From the proof of Theorem 4.2, it suﬃcient to show that one can replace the
harmonic function f deﬁned in Lemma 4.3 by a suitable analytic function g. Indeed,
we construct the desired function g as follows. Suppose that K has radius 0 < t < 1
and center u = (1, 0) ∈ R2. Deﬁne

g(λ) = √α + 1K α

z0(λ)(1 − |z0|2)

2+α

2 ,

where z0 = (1−st)u, 0 < s < 1. Then it is not hard to check that the two inequalities
in Lemma 4.3 both hold for g. Now the rest of the proof parallels exactly one given
in Theorem 4.2.
(cid:3)

Based on the theorem above, we can establish a relationship of the invertibility

between Toeplitz operators with nonnegative symbols on L2

a(ωα) and L2

h(ωα).

Corollary 4.5. Let ϕ be a nonnegative bounded measurable function on D. The
following four conditions are equivalent:
(1) Tϕ is invertible on L2
(2) Tϕ is invertible on L2

a(ωα);
h(ωα);

(3) bϕ is invertible in L∞(ωα);
(4) eϕ is invertible in L∞(ωα).

To end this section, we study Toeplitz operators with bounded analytic symbols on
h(ωα). Unlike the Bergman space L2
a(ωα) setting, the spectrum of analytic Toeplitz
h(ωα) is not equal to the closure of ϕ(D). Let H ∞ denote space of

L2
operator Tϕ on L2
analytic functions in L∞(ωα), we have the following result.
Theorem 4.6. Suppose that ϕ ∈ H ∞. If ϕ is invertible, then the Toeplitz operator
Tϕ is invertible on L2

h(ωα). However, the converse is not true.

Let ϕ ∈ H ∞ be invertible. However, TϕT1/ϕ = T1/ϕTϕ does not hold on the
harmonic Bergman space in the general case (see Theorem 5 in [3]). For this reason,
we need to ﬁnd some relationships between Tϕ and Tϕ to study the invertibility
problem. To do so, let us introduce some notations ﬁrst.

For ϕ ∈ L∞(ωα), we deﬁne

ϕ⋆(z) = ϕ(z) and ϕ∗(z) = ϕ(z).

Next, we deﬁne the unitary operator W : L2
a(ωα) by

L2

h(ωα) = zL2

a(ωα)⊕L2

a(ωα) → zL2

a(ωα)⊕

W =(cid:18) I O
O U (cid:19) ,

where U is a unitary operator on L2(ωα), deﬁned by Uf (z) = f (z).

It is clear that W ∗ maps zL2

a(ωα) ⊕ L2

a(ωα) to L2

h(ωα) and

W ∗ =(cid:18) I O
O U (cid:19) .

For f and g in L2(ωα), let f ⊗ g be the rank one operator deﬁned by

(f ⊗ g)h = hh, giL2(ωα)f

for h ∈ L2(ωα).

TOEPLITZ OPERATORS ON WEIGHTED HARMONIC BERGMAN SPACES

25

Let P denote the orthogonal projection from L2(ωα) to L2

a(ωα), we deﬁne the
Hankel operator with symbol ϕ acting on L2
a(ωα) by Hϕf = P (ϕUf ). Using the
notations above, we obtain the following matrix representation of W TϕW ∗, which
will be used to study the invertibility problem.
Lemma 4.7. Let ϕ ∈ L∞(ωα). On the space zL2

a(ωα) ⊕ L2

a(ωα) we have

W TϕW ∗ =(cid:18) Tϕ − (1 ⊗ ϕ) Hϕ − (1 ⊗ ϕ∗)

Proof. The proof is exactly the same as the proof of Theorem 2.1 in [8], we omit the

We are now ready to prove Theorem 4.6.

Proof of Theorem 4.6. For ϕ ∈ H ∞ and f ∈ zL2

a(ωα) we have
Hϕ⋆f = P (ϕ⋆Uf ) = P (ϕ(z)f (z)) = 0

and

since f (0) = 0.

(1 ⊗ ϕ)f = hf, ϕiL2(ωα)1 = 0,

Consequently, the matrix representation of W TϕW ∗ with ϕ ∈ H ∞ is given by

W TϕW ∗ =(cid:18) Tϕ Hϕ − (1 ⊗ ϕ∗)

(cid:19) .

Note that ϕ ∈ H ∞ is invertible implies that ϕ⋆ is also invertible, so that Tϕ⋆ is
invertible on L2
a(ωα) follows from ϕ is invertible. The
a(ωα).

above matrix representation tells us that W TϕW ∗ is invertible on zL2
Thus Tϕ is invertible on L2

On the other hand, Tϕ is invertible on zL2

a(ωα) ⊕ L2

To show there exists a function ϕ in H ∞ such that ϕ is not invertible in L∞(ωα)

5. A Reverse Carleson type Inequality for L2

h(ω)

In the preceding section, we study the invertibility problem of Toeplitz operators
via the reverse Carleson measures for standard weighted harmonic Bergman spaces.
In this section, we establish a suﬃcient condition for χGdA to be a reverse Carleson
measure for the space L2

h(ω), where ω ∈ A2 and G is a measurable set in D.

For a ∈ D, 0 < r < 1, recall that

S(a, r) = {z ∈ D : |z − a| < r(1 − |a|)}.

The main result in this section is Theorem 5.1, which is a harmonic version of Theorem
3.9 in [13].

26

ZIPENG WANG AND XIANFENG ZHAO

Theorem 5.1. Suppose that G ⊂ D and ω satisﬁes A2 condition.
δ ∈ (0, 1) and r ∈ (0, 1) such that for all a ∈ D

If there exist

then there exists a positive constant C = C(r, δ) such that

|G ∩ S(a, r)| > δ|S(a, r)|,

ZD |f (z)|2ω(z)dA(z) 6 CZG |f (z)|2ω(z)dA(z)

for all f ∈ L2

h(ω).

To prove the above theorem, we will adopt some ideas and techniques in [13].
Firstly, we need to introduce a new (weight) function ω∗ and discuss some properties
of ω∗. In the rest of this section, we use “r” and “δ” to denote the numbers provided
in Theorem 5.1.

Now we deﬁne a positive function ω∗ on the open unit disk as follows:

ω∗(z) = ω∗

r (z) := |S(z, r)|ω
|S(z, r)|

.

It is clear that ω∗ ∈ L1(dA), and so ω∗ is a weight. Moreover, ω∗ has the following
important property.
Lemma 5.2. Let z ∈ D, there exist constants C1 and C2 depending only on r such
that

C1ω∗(a) 6 ω∗(z) 6 C2ω∗(a)

for all a ∈ S(z, r). Consequently, we have

ZD

ω∗(a)
|S(a, r)|

χS(a,r)(z)dA(a) 6 C3ω∗(z)

(cid:0)z ∈ D(cid:1),

where C3 = C3(r) is a constant.

Proof. By Lemma 2.2 in [6], there exists a positive constant C depending only on r
such that

C −1|S(a, r)|ω 6 |S(z, r)|ω 6 C|S(a, r)|ω

Moreover, it is well known that |S(z, r)| is equivalent to |S(a, r)| (with constants
independent of a and z) if a ∈ S(z, r). This gives the ﬁrst conclusion of the lemma.
Based on this result, we have

ZD

where C3 is a positive constant depending only on r, as desired.

Another property of ω∗ is given by the following inequality, which will be used to

estimate the integral of |f|2ω over the subset G.
Lemma 5.3. Let ω be an A2 weight. Then there exists a constant C > 0 depending
only on r such that

(cid:3)

In order to complete the proof the main theorem in this section, the following two

key lemmas are also needed.

Proposition 5.4. Let G be the subset which satisﬁes the assumption in Theorem 5.1.
For η ∈ (0, 1), we deﬁne a subset F as the following:

Then one can choose η (depending only on δ and r) suﬃciently small such that

F := {z ∈ D : ω(z) > ηω∗(z)}.

Lemma 5.2 guarantees that there is a constant C = C(r) such that

The proof of the preceding lemma is some what long and it requires a number of
technical lemmas. Let us assume this result for the moment and we will prove it at
the end of this section. Now we give the proof of Theorem 5.1.

introduce some notations and prove three technical lemmas.

Let 0 < θ < 1
