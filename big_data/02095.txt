The quasinormal modes of relativistic compact objects encode important information about the gravitational
response associated with astrophysical phenomena. Detecting such oscillations would provide us with a unique
understanding of the properties of compact stars, and may give deﬁnitive evidence for the existence of black
holes. However, computing quasinormal modes in realistic astrophysical environments is challenging due to the
complexity of the spacetime background and of the dynamics of the perturbations. We discuss two complemen-
tary methods for computing the quasinormal modes of spherically symmetric astrophysical systems, namely,
the direct integration method and the continued-fraction method. We extend these techniques to dealing with
generic coupled systems of linear equations, with the only assumption being the interaction between different
ﬁelds is effectively localized within a ﬁnite region. In particular, we adapt the continued-fraction method to
include cases where a series solution can be obtained only outside an effective region. As an application, we
compute the polar quasinormal modes of boson stars by using the continued-fraction method for the ﬁrst time.
The methods discussed here can be applied to other situations in which the perturbations effectively couple only
within a ﬁnite region of space.

INTRODUCTION

The study of the natural oscillations of physical systems is
of much interest in astrophysics [1, 2]. For relativistic com-
pact objects such as stars and black holes, these natural oscil-
lations are referred to as quasinormal modes (QNMs). QNMs
depend only on the properties of the object. The radiation
emitted in the collapse of a star and in the coalescence of bi-
naries has a close relation to the QNMs of the ﬁnal compact
object. The composition of matter forming astrophysical ob-
jects is very important for the dynamics of the spacetime oscil-
lations. Indeed, many matter oscillations in Newtonian theory
are also necessarily present in the relativistic case [2]. Fluid
modes can also be excited, for instance, by a particle moving
around the compact object [3, 4], generating a large dephasing
in the gravitational-wave signal [5].

It is also of great interest to study how matter and ﬁelds
around black holes behave. The presence of matter around
black holes can lead to resonances, which were analyzed
in detail in Ref. [6].
Scalar ﬁelds around rotating Kerr
black holes can generate hairy conﬁgurations [7] (see also
Refs. [8, 9] for a recent review of black holes with scalar
hair). Moreover, massive scalar ﬁelds can form quasibound
states and develop scalar “clouds” around black holes [9–
13]. Notwithstanding, relativistic stars can also present non-
trivial gravitating ﬁeld conﬁgurations. For instance, very
strong magnetic ﬁelds in neutron stars—conﬁgurations known
as magnetars [14]—have an inﬂuence on the shape of the

star [15, 16]. Neutron stars can also accrete dark matter, ac-
quiring a core formed by an additional gravitating compo-
nent [17–19]. Moreover, stars formed by fundamental ﬁelds,
like boson stars (BSs) [20–22] and Proca stars [23], are also
interesting examples of the outcomes of self-interacting, grav-
itating ﬁelds.

All of the above examples share a common feature: they
are formed by components (matter and ﬁelds) coupled to each
other, with such a coupling being crucial for the structure of
the compact object. These interactions usually have a charac-
teristic length scale so that, at large distances, all ﬁelds decou-
ple or only the gravitational ﬁeld survives (through a power-
law falloff).

The coupling among different ﬁelds also impacts the analy-
sis of linear perturbation in such spacetimes. Additional com-
ponents describing the perturbations of relativistic objects can
enrich their oscillation spectra, generating distinctive signa-
tures. For instance, the scalar ﬁeld modes in BSs can be ex-
cited by an orbiting particle [5]. Notwithstanding, the scat-
tering of massive scalar wave packets can carry information
about the clouds around black holes [24]. However, it is difﬁ-
cult to analyze the QNM spectrum of such systems, basically
due to the fact that the coupling between the components is
highly nontrivial in most cases.

Here, we present two distinct methods for computing the
QNMs of relativistic systems—namely, the direct integration
method and the continued fraction method—to deal with situ-
ations in which the linearized perturbations interact only in a
ﬁnite region of space. The direct integration method discussed
here is similar to the one presented in Ref. [25]. On the other
hand, we extend the continued-fraction method adopted, e.g.,
in Refs. [26, 27], to deal with arbitrary coupled systems of
linear equations. One of the main advantages of our improved
method is that it does not need to assume a continued-fraction

representation that describes the solutions in the entire do-
main. Instead, we only require that a continued-fraction repre-
sentation exists outside an effective interaction region. This is
an advantage because, in many physical situations, the metric
is analytically known only outside an effective radius, so that a
continued-fraction representation is available only in a portion
of the full domain. We shall assume that the angular part of the
perturbations can be separated such that we end up with a sys-
tem of N coupled second order differential equations. This
separation naturally occurs in spherically symmetric conﬁg-
urations, and also for spinning, axisymmetric objects in the
slow-rotation approximation [25]. Additionally, we assume
that the background is stationary, so that the perturbations can
be Fourier decomposed with time dependence e−iσt, where σ
is the Fourier frequency. The above assumptions are valid in
a wide variety of astrophysical scenarios [1, 6, 25].

The decoupling of the perturbations outside an effective ra-
dius occurs naturally in BSs. In fact, the coupling between the
gravitational and scalar ﬁeld perturbations decrease exponen-
tially with the radial coordinate and become negligible beyond
a certain radius, where the scalar ﬁeld which composes the
BSs becomes small. Therefore, as an application of our im-
proved methods, we compute the QNMs of mini-BSs through
the continued-fraction technique, extending previous results
obtained with less robust methods [28]. We compute the po-
lar QNMs of mini-BSs as functions of the central ﬁeld density
and show that monopolar modes become unstable beyond a
critical density which corresponds to the maximum mass of
the BS.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Sec.
II we describe the direct integration and continued-fraction
methods for computing the QNMs modes of compact objects
surrounded by interacting ﬁelds.
III we apply the
improved direct integration and continued-fraction methods to
compute the QNMs of BSs. Moreover, we extend the results
presented in Ref. [28] by computing the QNMs of mini BSs as
a function of the central ﬁeld and compactness. We show that
the l = 0 modes become unstable beyond a critical density
corresponding to the maximum mass of the star. In Sec. IV
we discuss our results and deliver our ﬁnal remarks.

In Sec.

II. METHODS

We assume that the perturbation functions can be described

by the following set of equations:

Ψ(r) + (σ2 − V(r))Ψ(r) = 0,

(1)

d2
dr2∗

where r∗ is a tortoise radial coordinate, σ is the frequency of
the ﬁeld, Ψ(r) is an N-dimensional vector representing the
perturbations, and V(r) is an N × N matrix which can possi-
bly depend on σ. If the components of the perturbation Ψ(r)
are decoupled, V(r) is a diagonal matrix. In some scenarios,
it may be possible to obtain a set of decoupled equations for
the perturbations by performing a canonical transformation
within a Hamiltonian framework [29]. However, the only re-
striction to V(r) here is that it has a diagonal form for r > li,

where li denotes the characteristic range of the interaction be-
tween the components of Ψ(r).

A. Direct integration method

This method consists of integrating the differential equa-
tions within two different regions: near the origin and far from
the star, with the proper QNM boundary conditions. The prob-
lem of ﬁnding the QNM frequencies reduces to ﬁnding the
proper values of σ for which the solutions obtained integrating
from the origin and from inﬁnity are linearly dependent. This
method was ﬁrst used by Chandrasekhar and Detweiler [30],
and it was then applied to uniform density stars to compute
the least damped (lowest imaginary part) QNMs [31].

The boundary conditions at the origin can be written as1

Ψ(r ∼ 0) ∼ rl

xi
0 ri ,

(2)

N0(cid:88)

i=0

where the xi
0 are constant N-dimensional vectors and the up-
per summation limit N0 is chosen such that the boundary con-
ditions converge to the required accuracy. Substituting Eq. (2)
into Eq. (1) and expanding around r ∼ 0 leads to a recursion
0, such that all of them can be
relation for the coefﬁcients xi
written as functions of the coefﬁcients x0
0, which is a collec-
tion of N independent numbers. In this way, since the system
is linear, we can form a set of N independent solutions by
integrating from the origin by choosing the vector x0
0 to be,
e.g., (1, 0, ..., 0), (0, 1, ..., 0), ..., and (0, 0, ..., 1). The gen-
eral solution can be achieved by a linear combination of the
N independent solutions, namely,

(4)

where

Vjj(r → ∞) − σ2.

kj(σ) =

(5)
Depending on Vjj(r → ∞) and on the value of the frequency
σ, we select the value of the ± sign in Eq. (4) to suit the par-
ticular problem. For example, when σ2 > Vjj(r → ∞),

1 The potential V(r) usually diverges at the origin due to a centrifugal term,
and that is the reason for the rl term in Eq. (2), where l is the angular
number of the waves. See, e.g., Ref. [32] and the references therein. We
note that, if the central object is a black hole, QNMs are deﬁned by ingo-
ing waves at the event horizon. In this case, a different set of boundary
conditions should be imposed in place of Eq. (2).

N(cid:88)

the system allows perturbations which are wavelike at in-
ﬁnity, Ψj ∼ e±kj (σ) r∗ [with kj(σ) being complex]; when
σ2 < Vjj(r → ∞), the perturbations are bounded and we
require an exponential damping Ψj ∼ e−kj (σ) r∗ (see, e.g.,
Table II of Ref. [28]). The xi∞ are constant N-dimensional
vectors and the upper summation limit N0 in Eq. (4) has to be
chosen according to the precision required. Similar to the in-
tegration from the origin discussed above, one can construct a
set of N independent solutions by integrating the perturbation
equations from inﬁnity and by choosing different values for
x0±,∞. The solution integrated from inﬁnity can be written as
the following linear combination:

Ψ+(r) =

α+
n Ψ+

n (r),

(6)

where Ψ+
n denotes the nth independent solution of Eq. (1).
The QNM solutions are such that Ψ−(r) and Ψ+(r) are lin-
early dependent. We see that the QNM frequencies can be
found through

Ψ−(r)|r=Rext
Ψ−(cid:48)

,

(7)

where Rext > li. The conditions (7) generate a system of
2N equations for the 2N coefﬁcients α±
n and for σ. Since the
system is linear, we can set one of the α±
n ’s to unity; say, for
0 = 1. We then use the remaining 2N − 1 equa-
instance, α+
tions to ﬁnd the rest of the coefﬁcients as functions of σ. The
remaining equation is then used to ﬁnd the QNM frequencies.

B. Continued-fraction method

The continued-fraction method is a very powerful tech-
nique, with many applications in physics. In the context of
QNMs, it was ﬁrst used by Leaver [33], and has been exten-
sively studied by many authors since then [1]. One of the
main difﬁculties in computing QNMs in the frequency do-
main is the divergence of the wave functions at large distances.
The continued-fraction method works extremely well in some
cases because it maps the divergent boundary behavior in a
speciﬁc recurrence relation.

For stellar structures, the continued-fraction method should
actually be used in combination with a direct integration. Out-
side the star (in the vacuum region), one can recast the solu-
tion in terms of a continued fraction. However, in order to
guarantee that all the proper boundary conditions are satis-
ﬁed, we have to match continuously this outer solution with
the one obtained by integrating the differential equations from
the origin directly.

Reference [25] presents a method for computing the modes
through continued fractions, assuming that one can ﬁnd a se-
ries representation in the entire domain.
In particular, the
method of Ref. [25] requires that the background spacetime is
known analytically. However, in many astrophysical scenar-
ios the metric is constructed only numerically, which makes it

3

∞(cid:88)

difﬁcult to solve the equations through a Frobenius method in
the entire domain. Fortunately, even in the presence of inter-
acting ﬂuids and ﬁelds, the spacetime might still be described
analytically, at least outside an effective radius. This is the
case of (slowly rotating) stellar conﬁgurations, black holes
surrounded by matter, or self-gravitating solitons like BSs. In
these cases, it is possible to obtain a continued-fraction repre-
sentation of the solutions outside an effective radius, and then
to match this solution with the one obtained by integrating the
equations from requiring regularity at the origin. In this way,
we can assure that both boundary conditions are satisﬁed.

Let us expose the procedure to obtain a series representation
outside the effective radius. We again assume that the system
of equations can be described by Eq. (1) and that there exists
an expansion of the components of the wave vector as follows:

Ψ+

i (r) = Ξi(r)

ai,n vn,

(8)

n=0

where the index i denotes the ith component of the vector
functions and v ≡ (1−b/r), in which b is chosen such that the
series solution (8) is convergent [26]. The vector function Ξ is
chosen such that the vector Ψ+ satisﬁes the proper boundary
conditions at inﬁnity [34]—typically, its components are pro-
portional to e±kj (σ)r∗. Substituting the expansion (8) into the
differential equation (1) leads to recurrence relations for the
coefﬁcients ai,n [25, 33]. These could, in principle, be n-term
recurrence relations, which can be reduced to a three-term re-
currence relation by recursive Gaussian elimination steps. The
recurrence can be solved, writing all the coefﬁcients ai,n—
with n > 0—in terms of ai,0. Bellow, we explain the proce-
dure.

Let us illustrate this by assuming that we end up with a

four-term recurrence relation. We have

(9)
αnan+1 + βnan + γnan−1 + δnan−2 = 0, n > 1,
where αn, βn, γn and δn are N × N invertible matrices.
an is the vector whose components are the coefﬁcients ai,n
in the expansion (8). We can reduce the four-term recurrence
relation to a three-term one by using a matrix-valued Gaussian
elimination step [25]. Using

˜αn = αn,
˜β0 = β0,
˜γ0 = γ0,
˜βn = βn − δn
˜γn = γn − δn

one can show, through Eq. (9), that the tilde matrices satisfy
the following three-term recurrence relation:

˜αnan+1 + ˜βnan + ˜γnan−1 = 0, n > 0.

(15)

Deﬁning a ladder matrix R+

n with the following property,

(17)

Equation (17) may be solved recursively. We can start at
some large value of n—say N0—impose R+
= 0, and then,
N0
n ’s. The result has
moving backwards in n, determine all R+
the form of a continued fraction, justifying the name of the
method.2

Using Eqs. (16) and (17), we obtain all an’s as functions of
N parameters, given by a0. The expansion (8), with the de-
termined coefﬁcients, gives the solution to be used outside the
star. Therefore, there are N independent solutions of Eq. (1),
and the general solution is a linear combination of them, sim-
ilar to Eq. (6). Note that, since the recurrence relations are
valid outside the effective radius, the solutions in the interior
cannot be described by this procedure.

We still have to impose that the wave function Ψ satisﬁes
the proper boundary condition at the origin. For this pur-
pose, we can use the same procedure as in Sec. II B, obtaining
Ψ−(r), given by Eq. (3).

The QNM frequencies are found by requiring that the wave
functions obtained from inside and outside be linearly de-
pendent. Similarly to the direct integration method, we im-
pose Eq. (7). Note that the difference between the two meth-
ods is that we construct the outer solutions Ψ+ through the
continued-fraction approximations. For relativistic ordinary
stars, the continued-fraction method presented above reduced
to the one presented in Refs. [26, 27].

III. APPLICATION: QNMS OF A BOSON STAR

Here we extend the calculations of Ref. [28], computing
the QNMs of a BS through the improved continued-fraction
method. BSs are starlike conﬁgurations formed by self-
interacting gravitating complex scalar ﬁelds [20, 21]. In the
case of BSs, outside an effective radius, the perturbations of
the spacetime are well described by a decoupled system—two
equations describing the polar and axial parts of gravitational
perturbations and two equations describing the perturbations
of the complex scalar ﬁeld.3 The external spacetime is very
well approximated by the Schwarzschild geometry and, there-
fore, the continued-fraction expressions for the wave func-
tions outside the star are the same as in the Schwarzschild
case. For the gravitational part of the perturbations, one

bations for the scalar ﬁeld are coupled to each other even outside the star,
one can always decouple them by a suitable ﬁeld redeﬁnition [35].

can construct the continued-fraction relation using the Regge-
Wheeler equation and use it to obtain the polar and axial grav-
itational perturbations [33, 36]. For the scalar ﬁeld perturba-
tions, we can use the results of Ref. [37].

For the axial sector of the perturbations, the application of
the above method is direct since the equation for the axial per-
turbations is already in the form of Eq. (1). Moreover, the
scalar ﬁeld perturbations only couple to the polar sector of the
perturbations [38, 39].

For the polar sector of the perturbations, the method can be
applied using the ﬁrst order differential equations for the grav-
itational perturbations presented in Ref. [28] in the following
way.

i We solve the differential equations from the origin, choos-
ing the three free parameters such that we obtain the three
independent solutions for the metric and scalar ﬁeld per-
turbations.

ii Using the perturbations obtained by the procedure above,
we construct the corresponding Zerilli function ΨZ (which
describes the polar gravitational perturbations) of each
independent solution. With the independent solutions
(ΨZ, φ+, φ−), we obtain Ψ−(r) [Eq. (3)] (see Ref. [28]
for more details).

iii The vector Ψ+(r) can be constructed using either the
continued-fraction or the direct integration method. Since
the gravitational and scalar parts of the perturbations are
independent, they can be computed separately;

iv Finally, with the vector Ψ+(r), we ﬁnd the QNMs by

matching it at r = Rext with Ψ−(r), through Eq. (7).

Note that, for the polar case, since we are using the Zerilli
function to describe the gravitational perturbations, the point
Rext should be such that the background scalar ﬁeld at that
point is negligible.

We can now apply the above procedure to compute the
QNMs of a BS. A comparison between results obtained with
the direct integration procedure, as in Ref. [28], and with
the continued-fraction method for some BS conﬁgurations is
shown in Table I. Because of to the small imaginary part of the
modes, the divergence of the QNMs is weak and the agree-
ment between the two methods is remarkable.
In fact, this
good agreement between the two methods is expected because
the direct integration method is suitable for computing the
least damped modes.

In the case of BSs, the advantage of the continued-fraction
method over the direct integration is in the construction of
the background solutions. For the direct integration method
to work properly, we need to integrate from a point in which
V(r) has approximately a constant value (or zero). This inte-
gration from numerical inﬁnity can be strongly contaminated
by numerical errors, such that one generally has to compute
the sum in Eq. (4) up to, typically, N0 ∼ 15, and the back-
ground solutions need to be constructed up to a point far away
from the star. On the other hand, the only requirement for the
continued-fraction method to work properly is that the back-
ground scalar ﬁeld is small enough at Rext, and therefore that

the continued-fraction solutions can be constructed in a point
relatively close to the star.

By using the continued-fraction method, we can now com-
pute the modes of mini-BSs as a function of the central den-
sity and radius of the star, deﬁned as the radial point r which
contains 99% of the star’s total mass [28]. The results are
shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The monopole mode (l = 0, Fig.
1) exists due to the coupling between the scalar and gravita-
tional perturbations [28, 39]. In Fig. 2, we observe that the
quadrupole mode is stable in the considered range of the cen-
tral density. On the other hand, the monopole mode becomes

IV. DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS

We extended two different methods for computing the
QNMs of compact objects in the presence of interacting ﬁelds.
One of the methods is based on a direct integration of the
differential equations and the other is based on an analytical
continued-fraction scheme for describing the perturbations.
The methods can be applied in many astrophysical situations,
e.g., to compute the QNMs of relativistic stars surrounded by

We applied the direct integration and continued-fraction
methods to compute the polar QNMs of BSs. For the modes
analyzed, the continued-fraction method is in excellent agree-
ment with the direct integration one. Moreover, we computed
the modes as a function of the central value of the scalar ﬁeld,
showing that the monopole mode becomes unstable for con-
ﬁgurations beyond the maximum mass.

The techniques presented in this paper can be useful for the
computation of QNMs in complicated conﬁgurations. One
limitation of the continued-fraction method, however, is man-
ifest when dealing with lesser compact interacting ﬁelds, i.e.,
conﬁgurations with the longer length scale li (cid:29) R. In that
case, the divergence of the ﬁelds usually grows rapidly as r
increases, and numerical errors can contaminate the accuracy
of the solution. One possible way to circumvent that problem
is to mix the direct integration method with the continued-
fraction one—for instance, one can use the continued-fraction
expansion as an outer boundary condition for the integration
from inﬁnity, thus decreasing the errors introduced when us-
