LINEAR STABILITY OF THE SKYRMION

MATTHEW CREEK, ROLAND DONNINGER, WILHELM SCHLAG, AND STANLEY SNELSON

Abstract. We give a rigorous proof for the linear stability of the Skyrmion. In addition,
we provide new proofs for the existence of the Skyrmion and the GGMT bound.

1. Introduction

In the 1960s and 1970s there was a lot of interest in classical relativistic nonlinear ﬁeld
theories as models for the interaction of elementary particles. The idea was to describe
particles by solitons, i.e., static solutions of ﬁnite energy. Due to the success of the standard
model, where particles are described by linear (but quantized) ﬁelds, this original motivation
became somewhat moot. However, classical nonlinear ﬁeld theories continue to be an active
area of research, albeit for diﬀerent reasons. They are interesting as models for Einstein’s
equation of general relativity, in the context of nonperturbative quantum ﬁeld theory or in
the description of ferromagnetism. Furthermore, there is an ever-growing interest from the
pure mathematical perspective.

A rich source for ﬁeld theories with “natural” nonlinearities are geometric action principles.
One of the most prominent examples of this kind is the SU(2) sigma model [11] that arises
from the wave maps action

SWM(u) =ZR1,d

ηµν(u∗g)µν =ZR1,d

ηµν∂µuA∂νuBgAB ◦ u.

Here, the ﬁeld u is a map from (1+d)-dimensional Minkowski space (R1,d, η) to a Riemannian
manifold (M, g) with metric g. Geometrically, the wave maps Lagrangian is the trace of the
pull-back of the metric g under the map u. A typical choice is M = Sd with g the standard
round metric and in the following, we restrict ourselves to this case. For d = 3, one obtains
the classical SU(2) sigma model.
In general, the Euler-Lagrange equation associated to
the action SWM is called the wave maps equation. Unfortunately, the SU(2) sigma model
does not admit solitons and it develops singularities in ﬁnite time [26, 3, 7]. One way to
recover solitons is to lower the spatial dimension to d = 2 but this is less interesting from a
physical point of view and, even worse, the corresponding model still develops singularities
in ﬁnite time [4, 18, 25, 23]. Consequently, Skyrme [27] proposed to modify the wave maps
Lagrangian by adding higher-order terms. This leads to the (generalized) Skyrme action [21]

SSky(u) = SWM(u) +

Skyrme’s modiﬁcation breaks the scaling invariance which makes the model more rigid.
Heuristically speaking, rigidity favors the existence of solitons and makes ﬁnite-time blowup
less likely. The original Skyrme model arises from the action SSky in the case d = 3 and
M = S3.
By using standard spherical coordinates (t, r, θ, ϕ) on R1,3, one may consider so-called co-
rotational maps u : R1,3 → S3 of the form u(t, r, θ, ϕ) = (ψ(t, r), θ, ϕ). Under this symmetry
reduction the Skyrme model reduces to the scalar quasilinear wave equation

(wψt)t − (wψr)r + sin(2ψ) + sin(2ψ)(cid:18)sin2 ψ

r2 + ψ2

r − ψ2

t(cid:19) = 0

(1.1)

for the function ψ = ψ(t, r), where w = r2+2 sin2 ψ. It is well-known that there exists a static
solution F0 ∈ C ∞[0,∞) to Eq. (1.1) with the property that F0(0) = 0 and limr→∞ F0(r) = π.
This was proved by variational methods [17] and ODE techniques [22]. In fact, F0 is the
unique static solution with these boundary values [22] and called the Skyrmion. Unfortu-
nately, the Skyrmion is not known in closed form and as a consequence, even the most basic
questions concerning its role in the dynamics remain unanswered to this day.

1.1. Stability of the Skyrmion. Numerical studies [2] strongly suggest that the Skyrmion
is a global attractor for the nonlinear ﬂow. In particular, F0 should be stable under nonlinear
perturbations. A ﬁrst step in approaching this problem from a rigorous point of view is to
consider the linear stability of F0. To this end, one inserts the ansatz ψ(t, r) = F0(r)+φ(t, r)
into Eq. (1.1) and linearizes in φ. This leads to the linear wave equation

ϕtt − ϕrr +

2
r2 ϕ + V (r)ϕ = 0

for the auxiliary variable ϕ(t, r) =pr2 + 2 sin2 F0(r) φ(t, r). The potential V is given by

sin F0(r)

V = −4a2 1 + 3a2 + 3a4

(1 + 2a2)2

,

a(r) =

.

r

Consequently, the linear stability of the Skyrmion is governed by the ℓ = 1 Schr¨odinger
operator

Af (r) := −f ′′(r) +

2
r2 f (r) + V (r)f (r)

on L2(0,∞). More precisely, the Skyrmion is linearly stable if and only if A has no negative
eigenvalues. Unfortunately, the analysis of A is diﬃcult since the potential V is negative
and not known explicitly. Consequently, the linear stability of F0 hinges on the particular
shape of V and this renders the application of general soft arguments hopeless. Our main
result is the following.
Theorem 1.1. The Schr¨odinger operator A does not have eigenvalues. In particular, the
Skyrmion F0 is linearly stable.

1.2. Related work. Due to the complexity of the ﬁeld equation, there are not many rigorous
results on dynamical aspects of the Skyrme model. In [8], small data global well-posedness
and scattering is proved and [20] establishes large-data global well-posedness. There is also
some recent activity on the related but simpler Adkins-Nappi model, see e.g. [10, 9, 19].
From a numerical point of view, the linear stability of the Skyrmion is addressed in [14] and

2

[2] studies the nonlinear stability. As far as the method of proof is concerned, we note that
our approach is in parts inspired by [6].

1.3. Outline of the proof. According to the GGMT bound, see [13, 12, 24] or Appendix
A, the number of negative eigenvalues of A is bounded by

ν(V ) := 3−7 33Γ(8)

44Γ(4)2Z ∞

0

r7|V (r)|4dr.

Consequently, our aim is to show that ν(V ) < 1. In fact, by a perturbative argument this
also excludes the eigenvalue 0 and there cannot be threshold resonances at zero energy since
the decay of the recessive solution of Af = 0 is 1/r at inﬁnity. In Appendix A we elaborate
on this and give a new proof of the GGMT bound.
In order to show ν(V ) < 1, we proceed by an explicit construction of the Skyrmion F0.
In particular, this yields a new proof for the existence of the Skyrmion. Our approach is
mildly computer-assisted in the sense that one has to perform a large number of elementary
operations involving fractions. It is worth noting that all computations are done in Q, i.e.,
they are free of rounding or truncation errors. We also emphasize that the proof does not
require a computer algebra system. Consequently, the necessary computations can easily be
carried out using any programming language that supports fraction arithmetic. A natural
choice is Python which is open source and freely available for all common operating systems.

In the following, we give a brief outline of the main steps in the proof.

• We consider Eq. (1.1) for static solutions ψ(t, r) = F (r) and change variables accord-

ing to

F (r) = 2 arctan(cid:18)r(1 + r)g(cid:18) r − 1

r + 1(cid:19)(cid:19) .

The new independent variable x = r−1
r+1 allows us to compactify the problem by
considering x ∈ [−1, 1]. Furthermore, the arctan removes the trigonometric functions
in Eq. (1.1). Consequently, we obtain an equation of the form

R(g)(x) := g′′(x) + Φ(x, g(x), g′(x)) = 0

where Φ is a (fairly complicated) rational function of 3 variables.

• We numerically construct a very precise approximation to the Skyrmion. This is
done by employing a Chebyshev pseudospectral method [5]. The expansion coef-
ﬁcients are rationalized to allow for error-free computations in the sequel. This
leads to a polynomial gT(x) with rational coeﬃcients and we rigorously prove that
kR(gT)kL∞(−1,1) ≤ 1
500. As a consequence, the construction of the Skyrmion reduces
to ﬁnding a (small) correction δ(x) such that R(gT + δ) = 0.
• Next, we obtain bounds on second derivatives of Φ by employing rational interval
arithmetic. As a consequence, we obtain the representation

R(gT + δ) = R(gT) + Lδ + N (δ)

with explicit bounds on the nonlinear remainder N . The linear operator L is also
given explicitly in terms of gT and ﬁrst derivatives of Φ.
• Again, by a Chebyshev pseudospectral method, we numerically construct an approx-
imate fundamental system {u−, u+} for the linear equation Lu = 0. The functions
u± satisfy ˜Lu± = 0 for another linear operator ˜L that is close to L in a suitable sense.

3

Using u± we construct an inverse ˜L−1 to ˜L which allows us to rewrite the equation
R(gT + δ) = 0 as a ﬁxed point problem

δ = − ˜L−1R(gT) − ˜L−1(L − ˜L)δ − ˜L−1N (δ) =: K(δ).

From the explicit form of u± we obtain rigorous and explicit bounds on the operator
˜L−1.
• Finally, we prove that K is a contraction on a small closed ball in W 1,∞(−1, 1). This
yields the existence of a small correction δ(x) such that gT + δ solves the transformed
Skyrmion equation. From the uniqueness of the Skyrmion we conclude that

F0(r) = 2 arctan(cid:18)r(1 + r)(gT + δ)(cid:18)r − 1

r + 1(cid:19)(cid:19)

and the desired ν(V ) < 1 follows by elementary estimates.

1.4. Notation. Throughout the paper we abbreviate L∞ := L∞(−1, 1) and also W 1,∞ :=
W 1,∞(−1, 1). For the norm in W 1,∞ we use the convention
L∞ + kfk2

(2.1)

The Skyrmion F0 is the unique solution of Eq. (2.1) satisfying F0(0) = 0 and limr→∞ F0(r) =
π. More precisely, we have F0(r) = π + O(r−2) as r → ∞. Furthermore, it is known that the
Skyrmion is monotonically increasing [22]. In order to remove the trigonometric functions
it is thus natural to deﬁne a new dependent variable f : [0,∞) → R by

Then we have

F (r) =: 2 arctan f (r).

Eq. (2.2) can be written as

3. Numerical approximation of the Skyrmion

3.1. Description of the numerical method. We will require a fairly precise approxima-
tion to the Skyrmion. Already from a numerical point of view this is not entirely trivial
since a brute force approach is doomed to fail. That is why we employ a more sophisticated
Chebyshev pseudospectral method. To this end, we use the basis functions φn : [−1, 1] → R,
n ∈ N0, given by
(3.1)
where Tn are the standard Chebyshev polynomials. The constants an and bn are chosen in
such a way that the regularity conditions Eq. (2.9) are satisﬁed, i.e., we require

φn(x) := Tn(x) + an(1 + x) + bn(1 − x),

φ′

2φn(−1) = φ′

for all n ∈ N0. This yields φ0 = φ1 = 0 and

N0(cid:19) ,
xk = cos(cid:18) kπ
for N0 = 43 with R given in Eq. (2.4). The points (xk)N0−1
k=1 are the standard Gauß-Lobatto
collocation points for the Chebyshev pseudospectral method [5] with endpoints removed (we
only have N0 − 1 unknown coeﬃcients due to φ0 = φ1 = 0; in the standard Chebyshev
method one has N0 + 1 coeﬃcients to determine). Finally, we rationalize the numerically
obtained coeﬃcients (˜cn). The 42 coeﬃcients (cn)43
n=2 ⊂ Q obtained in this way are listed in
Table B.1.

k = 1, 2, . . . , N0 − 1

3.2. Methods for rigorous estimates. In order to obtain good estimates for the compli-
cated rational functions that will show up in the sequel, the following elementary observation
is useful.
Lemma 3.1. Let f ∈ C 1([−1, 1]) and set

ΩN := {−1 + 2k

N : k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N} ⊂ [−1, 1] ∩ Q,

N ∈ N.

Proof. The statements are simple consequences of the mean value theorem.

(cid:3)

Remark 3.2. In a typical application one ﬁrst obtains a rigorous but crude bound on f ′ by
elementary estimates. Then one uses a computer to evaluate f suﬃciently many times in
order to obtain a good bound on f .

Another powerful method for estimating complicated functions is provided by interval
arithmetic [1, 15]. We use the following elementary rules for operations involving intervals.
Deﬁnition 3.3. Let a, b, c, d ∈ R with a ≤ b and c ≤ d. Interval arithmetic is deﬁned by
the following operations.

[a, b] + [c, d] := [a + c, b + d]
[a, b] − [c, d] := [a − d, b − c]
[a, b] · [c, d] := [min{ac, ad, bc, bd}, max{ac, ad, bc, bd}]

[a, b]
[c, d]

:= [a, b] · [ 1

d, 1

c ] provided 0 /∈ [c, d].

If a, b, c, d ∈ Q, we speak of rational interval arithmetic. Furthermore, standard (rational)
arithmetic is embedded by identifying a ∈ R with [a, a].
Lemma 3.4. Let x ∈ [a, b] and y ∈ [c, d] and denote by ∗ any of the elementary operations
+,−,·, /. Then we have x ∗ y ∈ [a, b] ∗ [c, d].
Proof. The proof is an elementary exercise.

(cid:3)

Remark 3.5. If f is a complicated rational function of several variables (with rational coef-
ﬁcients), rational interval arithmetic is an eﬀective way to obtain a rigorous and reasonable
bound on f (Ω), provided Ω is a product of closed intervals with rational endpoints. The nec-
essary computations can easily be carried out on a computer as they only involve elementary
operations in Q. The quality of the bound, however, depends on the particular algebraic
form that is used to represent f . Furthermore, in typical applications the bound can be

improved considerably by splitting the domain Ω in smaller subdomains Ωk, i.e., Ω =Sk Ωk,

and by estimating each f (Ωk) separately by interval arithmetic.

It is empirically found to improve
some of the estimates that follow. By Eq. (2.7), Q is a polynomial with rational coeﬃcients
and by the regularity conditions Eq. (3.2) together with Eq. (2.8), the same is true for P .
Furthermore, Q(x) > 0 for all x ∈ [−1, 1] and from the explicit expressions for Φk and Ψ,
Eqs. (2.6) and (2.7), we read oﬀ the estimates deg P ≤ 319 and deg Q ≤ 278.
For the following it is advantageous to straighten the denominator. To this end we obtain
a truncated Chebyshev expansion of 1/Q,

4. Estimates for the nonlinearity

By employing rational interval arithmetic, we prove bounds on second derivatives of the
function Φ. This leads to explicit bounds for the nonlinear operator.

All of the polynomials of two variables x, y that appear in the sequel are implicitly assumed

to be given in the following canonical form

k0

(1 + x)αk (1 − x)βkPk(x)yk

Xk=0

where k0, αk, βk ∈ N0 and Pk are polynomials with rational coeﬃcients and Pk(±1) 6= 0.
This is important since the outcome of interval arithmetic depends on the representation of
the function.

4.1. Pointwise estimates.
Lemma 4.1. Let Ω = [−1, 1] × [ 11

Proof. We begin with the simplest estimate, that is, the bound on ∂2

3 Φ. We set

ˆΦk(x, y) :=

Ψ(x, y)

with Φk and Ψ from Eqs. (2.6) and (2.7), respectively. Observe that ˆΦ2 is a polynomial.

20]) ⊂ [10−4, 13]. Con-
3 Φ is a rational function without poles in Ω. Rational interval arithmetic then

3Φ(Ω) ⊂ [−8, 8] and this proves the stated bound for ∂2

20, 21

Next, we consider ∂2∂3Φ. We have

∂y∂zΦ(x, y, z) = ∂y

ˆΦ1(x, y) + 2 ˆΦ2(x, y)z

ˆΨ(x, y)

=

ˆΨ(x, y)∂y ˆΦ1(x, y) − ∂y ˆΨ(x, y) ˆΦ1(x, y)

ˆΨ(x, y)2

+ 2z

ˆΨ(x, y)∂y ˆΦ2(x, y) − ∂y ˆΨ(x, y) ˆΦ2(x, y)

ˆΨ(x, y)2

2Here and in the following, the domain Ω needs to be divided in suﬃciently small subdomains Ωk ⊂ Ω
such that Ω =Sk Ωk, see Remark 3.5.

10

and, since ˆΦ2 is a polynomial, the last term is a rational function without poles in Ω. Note
further that the numerator of the second to last term appears to be singular at x ∈ {−1, 1},
but in fact there is a cancellation so that

ˆΨ(x, y)∂y ˆΦ1(x, y) − ∂y ˆΨ(x, y) ˆΦ1(x, y)

= 2−11(1 + x)7(1 − x)3(17 − 43x + 7x2 + 3x3)y9
− 2−11(1 + x)5(1 − x)7(17 − 15x + 7x2 + 7x3)y7
− 2−14(1 + x)(1 − x)11(285 − 637x + 794x2 − 386x3 + 41x4 + 95x5)y5
− 2−15(1 + x)(1 − x)15(25 − 31x + 15x2 + 7x3)y3
+ 2−19(1 − x)19(1 − 12x + 3x2)y.

We conclude that ∂2∂3Φ is a rational function without poles in Ω and rational interval
arithmetic yields ∂2∂3Φ(Ω) ⊂ [−22, 22].

Finally, we turn to ∂2

2Φ. We have

∂yΦ(x, y, z) =

ˆΨk(x, y)zk

where ˆΨk := ˆΨ∂2 ˆΦk − ∂2 ˆΨ ˆΦk. From above we recall that ˆΨ1 and ˆΨ2 are polynomials. We
obtain

is in fact a polynomial since it exhibits a special cancellation. Consequently, ∂2
function without poles in Ω and rational interval arithmetic yields the desired bound.

5. Analysis of the linear operator

In this section we construct a linear operator ˜L with an explicit fundamental system such
that L − ˜L is small in L∞(−1, 1). Then we invert ˜L and prove an explicit bound on the
inverse.

5.1. Asymptotics. First, we study the asymptotic behavior of ∂2Φ and ∂3Φ.

Lemma 5.1. We have

for x ∈ [0, 1).

with Φk given in Eq. (2.6). Recall that ˆΨ is a polynomial with no zeros in [−1, 1] × [ 11

Φ0(−1, y) = 4y + 32y3
Φ1(−1, y) = 8 + 64y2

Φ0(1, y) = 4y7
Φ1(1, y) = −8y6
Φ2(1, y) = 0
ˆΨ(1, y) = y6.

Consequently,

Lemma 5.1 implies that p and q are rational functions with no poles in [−1, 1].
Lemma 5.2. The equation Lu = 0 has fundamental systems {u−, v−} and {u+, v+} on
(−1, 1) which satisfy

for x ∈ (−1, 0], as well as

u−(x) = 1 + O(1 + x)

v−(x) = O((1 + x)−3)

u+(x) = 1 + O(1 − x)
u′

2 + O(1 − x)
v+(x) = O((1 − x)−3)

for x ∈ [0, 1). Furthermore, u−, v−, u+, v+ ∈ C ∞(−1, 1) and u− ∈ C ∞([−1, 1)), u+ ∈
C ∞((−1, 1]).
Proof. The coeﬃcients of the equation Lu = 0 are rational functions and the only poles in
[−1, 1] are at x = −1 and x = 1. These poles are regular singular points of the equation with
Frobenius indices {−3, 0}. Consequently, the statements follow by Frobenius’ method. (cid:3)
5.2. Numerical construction of an approximate fundamental system. We obtain
an approximate fundamental system {u−, u+}, where u± is smooth at ±1, by a Chebyshev
pseudospectral method. As always, special care has to be taken near the singular endpoints
±1. Solutions u of Lu = 0 that are regular at −1 must satisfy u′(−1) + 1
2u(−1) = 0.
Similarly, regularity at 1 requires u′(1) − 1

2u(1) = 0, cf. Eq. (2.9). If one sets

Next, we analyze the approximate fundamental system {u−, u+}.

Proposition 5.4. We have W (u−, u+)(x) = (1 − x2)−4W0(x), where W0 is a polynomial
with no zeros in [−1, 1]. Furthermore, the functions u± satisfy

where ˜Lu := L0u + ˜pu′ + ˜qu, and

k˜p − pkL∞ ≤ 3
100 ,

k˜q − qkL∞ ≤ 1
20.

˜Lu± = 0,

Proof. We temporarily set p±(x) := (1 ± x)−3. Then we have

W (u−, u+) = W (p−w−, p+w+) = W (p−, p+)w−w+ + p−p+W (w−, w+)

and, since W (p−, p+)(x) = −6(1 − x2)−4, we infer W (u−, u+)(x) = (1 − x2)−4W0(x) with

W0(x) = −6w−(x)w+(x) + (1 − x2)W (w−, w+)(x).

Obviously, W0 is a polynomial with deg W0 ≤ 61, see Deﬁnition 5.3. We re-expand W0 in

we straighten the denominator, i.e., we try to ﬁnd an approximation to

multiply the numerator and denominator by the polynomial ( 13

Note that P4 and P5 are polynomials with rational coeﬃcients and deg P4 ≤ 346, deg P5 ≤

6. Linear stability of the Skyrmion

Now we are ready to conclude the proof of Theorem 1.1.

6.1. The main contraction argument. Recall that we aim for solving the equation
R(gT + δ) = 0, i.e.,

see Proposition 4.3. We rewrite this equation as

Lδ = −R(gT) − N (δ),

and apply ˜L−1, which yields

˜Lδ = −R(gT) + ( ˜L − L)δ − N (δ)

δ = − ˜L−1R(gT) + ˜L−1( ˜L − L)δ − ˜L−1N (δ) =: K(δ)

Thus, our goal is to prove that K has a ﬁxed point.
Lemma 6.1. Let X := {u ∈ C 1[−1, 1] : kukW 1,∞ ≤ 1
in X.

150}. Then K has a unique ﬁxed point

Proof. From Propositions 3.7, 4.3, 5.4, and Corollary 5.6 we obtain the estimate

for all u, v ∈ X. Thus, the claim follows from the contraction mapping principle.

(cid:3)

Finally, we obtain the desired approximation to the Skyrmion.
Corollary 6.2. There exists a δ ∈ C 1[−1, 1] with kδkW 1,∞ ≤ 1

given by

150 such that the Skyrmion is

F0(r) = 2 arctan(cid:18)r(1 + r)(cid:18)gT(cid:18)r − 1

r + 1(cid:19) + δ(cid:18) r − 1

r + 1(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:19) .

Proof. By construction, Lemma 6.1, and standard ODE regularity theory, there exists a
δ with the stated properties such that F0 is a smooth solution to the original Skyrmion
equation (2.1). Obviously, we have F0(0) = 0 and from gT(x) ∈ [ 1
2] for all x ∈ [−1, 1], see
Proposition 3.7, we infer limr→∞ F0(r) = π. Since the Skyrmion is the unique solution of
Eq. (2.1) with these boundary values [22], the claim follows.

Consequently, the GGMT bound, see Appendix A, implies that A has no eigenvalues.

Appendix A. The GGMT bound

Consider H = −∆+V in R3 where V ∈ L1∩L∞(R3) (say) and radial. The GGMT bound [13]
is as follows (see also [12]). We restrict ourselves to a smaller range of p than necessary since
it is technically easier and suﬃcient.

then H has no negative eigenvalues. Furthermore, zero energy is neither an eigenvalue nor

ψ ∈ H 2(R3), kψk2 = 1, and radial, E < 0. So

IfR V ψ 6= 0, then ψ(x) ≃ |x|−1 for large x, which is not L2. SoR V ψ = 0 and ψ(x) = O(|x|−2)
as x → ∞. One has hHψ, ψi = 0 instead of (A.2). Replacing H with Hε = H − εe−|x|2 for
small ε > 0 we conclude that

and Hε therefore has negative spectrum, while (A.1) still holds for small ε. By the previous
case, this gives a contradiction.

hHεψ, ψi < 0

If 0 is a resonance, this means that there is a solution ψ ∈ H 2
loc(R3) with ψ(x) ≃ |x|−1 as
x → ∞ (and by the reasoning above this holds if and only if R V ψ 6= 0). In particular, since
∇ψ ∈ L2 and since R V ψ2 is absolutely convergent, we still arrive at the conclusion that
hHψ, ψi = 0. Substituting Hε for H as above again gives a contradiction. To be precise, we
evaluate the quadratic form of Hε on the functions

ψR(x) := χ(x/R)ψ(x)

where χ is a standard bump function of compact support and equal to 1 on the unit ball.
Sending R → ∞ then shows that Hε has negative spectrum.
(cid:3)

The following lemma establishes the constant µq in the previous proof. The variational
problem (A.4) is invariant under a two-dimensional group of symmetries: Sξ,η(ψ)(x) =
eξψ(eηx), ξ, η ∈ R. The scaling of the independent variable leads to a loss of compactness.
To make it easier to apply the standard methods of concentration-compactness, we employ
the same change of variables as in [13].

To proceed, we recall that for any b > 0

Inserting this into (A.10) yields

Using Γ(p)Γ(p + 1

(A.9) back to the original coordinates.

Theorem A.1 is insuﬃcient for linearized Skyrme. The reason being that the Helmholtz

equation associated with the latter is of the form

2
r2 + V (r))ψ = k2ψ

−ψ′′ +(cid:0)

which has extra repulsivity coming from the 2
r2 potential. On the level of the Schr¨odinger
equation in R3 this precisely amounts to restricting to angular momentum ℓ = 1. So we
expect that a weaker condition on V than the one stated in Theorem A.1 will suﬃce. This
is essential for our applications to linearized Skyrme stability.

In fact, as already noted in [13], for general angular momentum ℓ > 0 we are faced with
4(2ℓ + 1)2ϕ2.

the minimzation problem which is obtained from (A.5) by replacing 1
However, the scaling

4ϕ2 with 1

ϕ(x) = ϕ1((2ℓ + 1)x)

takes us back to the minimization problem (A.5) with an extra factor of (2ℓ + 1)1+ 1
q . Recall
that Theorem A.1 is nothing other than µ−p
p < 1. Therefore, to exclude eigenfunc-
tions and threshold resonances of angular momentum ℓ condition (A.1) needs to be multiplied
on the left by a factor of

q krαV−kp

(2ℓ + 1)−p(1+ 1

q ) = (2ℓ + 1)−(2p−1)

In the summary, the suﬃcient GGMT criterion for absence of bound states and threshold
resonances in angular momentum ℓ reads
(2ℓ + 1)2p−1ppΓ2(p)Z ∞
(p − 1)p−1Γ(2p)

2 ≤ p < ∞. For linear Skyrme stability we use this criterion with ℓ = 1 and p = 4.
