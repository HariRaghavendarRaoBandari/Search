Abstract

In this paper we present a scenario where the stability of dark matter and the phenomenology

of neutrinos are related by the spontaneous breaking of a non-Abelian ﬂavor symmetry. In this

scenario the breaking is done at the seesaw scale, in such a way that what remains of the ﬂavor

symmetry is a Z2 symmetry, which stabilizes the dark matter. We have proposed two models based

on this idea, for which we have calculated their neutrino mass matrices achieving two-zero texture

in both cases. Accordingly, we have updated this two-zero texture phenomenology ﬁnding an

interesting correlation between the reactor mixing angle and the sum of the light neutrino masses.

We also have a correlation between the lightest neutrino mass and the neutrinoless double beta

decay eﬀective mass, obtaining a lower bound for the eﬀective mass within the region of the nearly

future experimental sensitivities.

INTRODUCTION

Neutrino masses, the existence of dark matter (DM) and the baryon asymmetry in the

Universe (BAU) are the most important evidences of physics beyond the Standard Model

(SM). Here we propose that the same symmetry explaining neutrino mixing angles is also

responsible for the dark matter stability in the context of the Discrete Dark Matter (DDM)

mechanism [1]. Under certain conditions it would be possible also to account for the BAU via

Leptogenesis. The DDM is based upon the fact that the breaking of a discrete non-Abelian

ﬂavor symmetry into one of its subgroups by means of the electroweak symmetry breaking

mechanism1, accounts for the neutrino masses and mixing pattern and for the Dark Matter

stability.

In the original model [1], the group of even permutation of four objects, A4 ,was considered

as the ﬂavor symmetry. A4 contains one tridimensional irreducible representation, 3, and
three onedimensional irreducible representations, 1, 1(cid:48) and 1(cid:48)(cid:48) whose algebra can be reviewed
four SU (2) higgs
in Appendix A, see for instance [2–5]. The particle content includes:

doublets, three of them transforming as an A4 triplet η = (η1, η2, η3), and the SM Higgs H

as the singlet 1; four Right-Handed (RH) neutrinos, three of them in a triplet representation

of A4, NT = (N1, N2, N3), and a singlet 1 of A4, N4. The lepton doublets Li and the right

charged leptons li transform as the three diﬀerent singlets under A4, in such a way the mass

matrix for the charged lepton is diagonal. Breaking the A4 symmetry into a Z2 subgroup

through the electroweak symmetry breaking, provides the stability mechanism for the DM,

arising from the Z2-odd part of the triplet η, and at the same time accounts for the neutrino

masses and mixing patterns by means of the type I see-saw [6–11]. The predictions for the

neutrino sector are an inverse mass hierarchy spectrum with a massless neutrino, mν3 = 02,
and a vanishing reactor neutrino mixing angle, θ13 = 0, that nowadays is ruled out by the

current experimental data [12–14]. Even though, there is an issue with reactor mixing angle,

the original A4 model has a quite interesting neutrino and DM phenomenology, as can be

seen in [15].

In a subsequent paper, this A4 model has been modiﬁed [16], by adding a ﬁfth RH neutrino

1 It is possible to break the ﬂavor symmetry with ﬂavon ﬁeld at other scale other than the electroweak, as

we will discuss later.

2 This is because only two of the RH neutrinos participate in the see-saw mechanism.

N5 transforming as 1(cid:48)(cid:48) and changing the representation of N4 to 1(cid:48). This new model gives as
predictions: a normal mass spectrum, a lower bound for the neutrinoless double beta decay
eﬀective mass, |mee|, and a non-zero reactor neutrino mixing angle. Nevertheless, even if
this mixing angle were non-zero at its maximum value, it is again ruled out by the current

experimental data.

There are some other works in this direction, where other a ﬂavor symmetry groups have

been used, for instance a model based on the dihedral group D4 where some ﬂavor changing

neutral currents are present and constrain the DM sector [17] and a model based on the

∆(54) [18]. Finally, it is worth mentioning that there have been works tackling the problem

of the vanishing reactor mixing angle within the A4 DDM model [19], but in such a case the

A4 symmetry has to be explicitly broken in the scalar potential.

The paper is organized as follows: in section II we explain our models giving their matter

content and derive the neutrino mass matrices, in section III we discuss the phenomenology

and in section IV we draw our conclusions.

II. REACTOR MIXING ANGLE AND THE DDM MECHANISM

We will consider two extensions of the model in reference [1], hereafter referred as model

A and model B, where in addition to the original model matter content, we have added
one extra RH neutrino N5, in a singlet representation of A4 (1(cid:48) or 1(cid:48)(cid:48)) and three real scalar
singlets of the SM transforming as triplet under A4, φ = (φ1, φ2, φ3). The relevant particle

content and quantum numbers of model A and model B have been summarized on Table I
and Table II respectively. The N5 RH neutrino is assigned to the 1(cid:48) representation of A4 in
model A and to the 1(cid:48)(cid:48) A4 representation in model B. The ﬂavon ﬁelds, φ, acquire a vacuum
expectation value around the see-saw scale, such that A4 is broken into a Z2 at this scale

instead of at the electroweak scale as in the original model. In this way, the ﬂavon ﬁelds

contribute to the RH neutrino masses.

Model A

If we consider the matter content in Table I, the lepton Yukawa Lagrangian is given by3:

1 [NT φ]3NT + yN

2 [NT φ]1N4 + yN

3 [NT φ]1(cid:48)(cid:48)N5 + h.c.

where [a, b]j, stands for the product of the two triplets a, b contracted into the j represen-

tation of A4. In this way H is responsible for quark (considering the quarks as singlet of

A4) and charged lepton masses, the latter automatically diagonal, Ml = vh diag ( ye, yµ, yτ ).

The Dirac neutrino mass matrix arises from H and η. The ﬂavon ﬁelds will contribute to

the RH neutrino mass matrix. Once the ﬂavon ﬁelds acquire a vev, A4 will be broken. In

order to preserve a Z2 symmetry, the alignment of the vev’s will be of the form:

(cid:10)H 0(cid:11) = vh (cid:54)= 0,

(cid:10)η0

(cid:11) = vη (cid:54)= 0,

(cid:11) = 0,

(cid:104)φ1(cid:105) = vφ (cid:54)= 0,

(cid:104)φ2,3(cid:105) = 0. (2)

Therefore, (1, 0, 0), is the vacuum alignment for the A4 scalar triplets, which is a way

to break spontaneously A4 into a Z2 subgroup, in the A4 basis where the S generator is

diagonal, see Appendix A.

The mass matrix in eq. (5), has the form of the B3 two-zero neutrino mass matrix [20],

which phenomenology has been extensively studied in the literature, see for instance [20–

29]. This matrix is consistent with both neutrino mass hierarchies and can accommodate

the experimental value for the reactor mixing angle, θ13 [20–29]. The phenomenological

implications of this scenario will be studied in section III.

which correspond, as before, to another two-zero texture ﬂavor neutrino mass matrix, B4 [20],

which also is consistent with both neutrino mass hierarchies and can also accommodate the

reactor mixing angle, θ13 [20–29].

III. RESULTS

In the previous section, we obtained the two-zero texture neutrino mass matrices B3 and

B4 for the model A and B respectively. We performed the analysis using four independent

constraints, coming from the two complex zeroes, to correlate two of the neutrino mixing

parameters: the neutrino masses and mixing angles, the two Majorana phases and the Dirac

CP violating phase4. We took the experimental values of the three mixing angles and the

two squared mass diﬀerences as inputs and numerically scanned within their 3σ regions and

determine the regions allowed by two correlated variables of interest. We have used in the

analysis the data from three diﬀerent groups that perform the neutrino global ﬁts [12–14].

In ﬁgures 1, 3 and 5 we show the correlation between the atmospheric mixing angle,

sin2 θ23, and the sum of light neutrino masses, (cid:80) mν = mν1 + mν2 + mν3, for model A on
sin2 θ23 vs. (cid:80) mν, for the normal hierarchy (NH) is plotted in magenta and for the inverse

the left panels and model B on the right ones. In these graphics, the allowed 3σ regions in

hierarchy (IH) in cyan. The 1σ in the atmospheric angle are represented by the horizontal

blue and red shaded regions for the inverted and normal mass hierarchy respectively and

the best ﬁt values correspond to the horizontal blue and red dashed lines for the inverse

and normal hierarchies respectively. In Forero et. al [12], they have a local minimum in the

atmospheric mixing angle for the IH analysis; that we represent as a red pointed line in ﬁgure

1. In addition, in the analysis by Capozzi et. al [14], they have obtained two diﬀerent and

separated 1σ regions in the atmospheric angle also for the IH; that we show as the double

blue shaded horizontal bands in 5. The grey vertical band representing a disfavored region

in the sum of light neutrino masses,(cid:80) mν < 0.23 eV, by the Planck Collaboration [30].

From the plots in ﬁgures 1, 3 and 5, it can be seen that in model A both hierarchies

have an overlap within the 1σ region for the atmospheric mixing angle, while in model

B depending on what data is used the overlap not always exists. For data from Forero

et. al. [12] and Gonzalez-Garcia et. al.

[13], only the NH the atmospheric mixing angle

overlaps with the 1σ region (even though for data from [13] it happen for large neutrino

masses disfavored by Planck). For data from Capozzi et. al [14], only in the IH case there

is the 1σ overlap in the second octant for the atmospheric mixing angle. Finally, it is worth

mentioning that the NH and IH regions in model A are the same but interchanged in model

B.

The other correlation we obtained in the models is the neutrinoless double beta decay
eﬀective mass parameter, |mee|, with the lightest neutrino mass, mνlight, where mνlight = mν1
in the normal hierarchy and mνlight = mν3 in the inverted hierarchy. The ﬁgures 2, 4 and 6
show mνlight versus |mee| for model A (B3) on the left panels and model B (B4) on the right
ones. The region for the NH within 3σ are in dark magenta and taking the overlap for

the atmospheric mixing angle of 1σ in magenta; similarly, the region corresponding to the

IH within 3σ are in dark cyan and within 1σ in cyan. The horizontal red shaded region

7

corresponds the current experimental limit on neutrinoless double beta decay [31], the red
and blue lines are the forthcoming experimental sensitivities on |mee| [32–35] and mνlight [36]
respectively. The vertical blue shaded region is disfavored by the current Planck data [30].

In the graphics, we also show in yellow and green the bands corresponding to the 3σ “ﬂavor-

generic” inverse and normal hierarchy neutrino spectra respectively.

It can be seen from ﬁgures 2 and 4, that for model B there is no 1σ overlap between

the prediction and the experimental data for the atmospheric mixing angle and therefore

we only show the data for the 3σ regions in the IH. In ﬁgure 6, it can be seen that also

the results in model B do not overlap with the 1σ region for NH case, as we mentioned
before. The models predict Majorana phases giving a minimal cancelation for the |mee|, as
can bee seen in ﬁgures 2, 4 and 6. The allowed regions for the |mee| are in the upper
lines for NH and IH generic bands. The two-zero textures B3 and B4, are sensitive to the

value of the atmospheric mixing angle. In the cases in which the atmospheric mixing angle

prediction overlaps with the experimental value at 1σ, it translates to a localized region for

neutrinoless double beta decay within the near future experimental sensitivity, which is a

desirable feature. A better measurement of the atmospheric mixing angle would be crucial

for this kind of scenarios.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have constructed two models based on the Discrete Dark Matter mechanism where

the non-Abelian A4 ﬂavor symmetry is spontaneously broken at the see-saw scale, into a

remanent Z2.

In these models, we have a total of ﬁve RH neutrinos.

In this case, two

RH neutrinos are in the Z2 odd sector and the other three RH are even under Z2. This

three RH neutrinos are responsible for giving the light neutrino masses via type-I see-saw.

Additionally, we have added ﬂavon scalar ﬁelds φ leading to the A4 breaking in such a way

that we obtained two-zero textures for the light Majorana neutrinos. These textures give rise

to rich neutrino phenomenology: the results are in agreement with the experimental data

of the reactor mixing angle and accomodate the two possible neutrino mass hierarchies,

IN and NH. Another consequence of the way A4 is broken is that these models contain a

DM candidate stabilized by the remnant Z2 symmetry. We have updated the analysis for

the two-zero textures mass matrix obtained for both models B3 and B4. We presented the

(bue) shaded regions are the 1σ in sin2 θ23 for NH (IH). The case for IH has two favored 1sigma

regions according to the data used. The red (blue) horizontal dashed line is the best ﬁt value in NH

(IH). The data was taken from [14]. The vertical grey shaded region is disfavored by the current

Planck data [30].

hierarchy neutrino spectra. The horizontal red shaded region is the current experimental limit

on 0νββ, the red (blue) horizontal (vertical) lines are the forthcoming experimental sensitivity on

correlation between the atmospheric mixing angle and the sum of the light neutrino masses

as well as the lower bounds for neutrinoless double beta decay eﬀective mass parameter,

the latter being in the region of sensitivity of the near future experiments. Finally, if the

ﬂavon ﬁelds acquire vevs at a scale slightly higher than the see-saw scale, the remaining

symmetry at the see-saw scale is the Z2, and this would imply a mixing of the three Z2 even

RH neutrinos, which could be crucial if we want to have a scenario for leptogenesis, since in

the A4 symmetric case this was not possible5.
