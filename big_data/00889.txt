THE DISTRIBUTION OF CLASS NUMBERS IN A SPECIAL

FAMILY OF REAL QUADRATIC FIELDS

ALEXANDER DAHL AND YOUNESS LAMZOURI

Abstract. We investigate the distribution of class numbers in the family of real
quadratic ﬁelds Q(√d) corresponding to fundamental discriminants of the form d =
4m2 + 1, which we refer to as Chowla’s family. Our results show a strong similarity
between the distribution of class numbers in this family and that of class numbers of
imaginary quadratic ﬁelds. As an application of our results, we prove that the average
order of the number of quadratic ﬁelds in Chowla’s family with class number h is
(log h)/2G, where G is Catalan’s constant. With minor modiﬁcations, one can obtain
similar results for Yokoi’s family of real quadratic ﬁelds Q(√d), which correspond to
fundamental discriminants of the form d = m2 + 4.

1. Introduction

A fundamental problem in number theory is to understand the size of the class
group of an algebraic number ﬁeld K. This quantity, called the class number of K, is
a measure of how badly factorization in the ring of integers of K fails to be unique.
The case of quadratic ﬁelds had received great attention, and its rich history stretches
back to the work of Gauss. Let d be a fundamental discriminant and h(d) be the class

number of the quadratic ﬁeld Q(√d). Gauss conjectured that h(d) → ∞ as d → −∞,

and asked for the determination of all imaginary quadratic ﬁelds with a given class
number h, a question that became known as the Gauss class number problem. The
former conjecture of Gauss was proved by Heilbronn, and his class number problem
for h = 1 was solved by Heegner, Baker, and Stark. We now have a complete list of all
imaginary quadratic ﬁelds with class number h for all h ≤ 100 thanks to the work of
Watkins [20].

Unlike imaginary quadratic ﬁelds, very little is known about real quadratic ﬁelds.
In this case, Gauss conjectured that there are inﬁnitely many real quadratic ﬁelds
with class number 1, a problem that is still open. The main diﬀerence with imaginary
quadratic ﬁelds is the existence of non-trivial units in Q(√d) if d > 0, which heavily
aﬀect the size of the class number h(d) in this case. Indeed, Dirichlet’s class number
formula states that for d > 0 we have

where χd =(cid:0) d
·(cid:1) is the Kronecker symbol, and εd is the fundamental unit of the quadratic
ﬁeld Q(√d), deﬁned as εd = (a+b√d)/2, where a and b are the smallest positive integer
solutions to the Pell equations a2 − b2d = ±4.

Although it is a diﬃcult problem to estimate the fundamental unit εd in general,
there exist several families of real quadratic ﬁelds for which εd is small in terms of d,
and hence for which h(d) is large. One important example is the family of real quadratic
ﬁelds Q(√d) corresponding to fundamental discriminants d the form 4m2 + 1, where m
is a positive integer. This family was ﬁrst studied by Chowla, who conjectured that for
any positive integer m > 13 such that 4m2 + 1 is squarefree, we have h(4m2 + 1) > 1
(see [3]). Another example is the family of ﬁelds Q(√d) corresponding to fundamental
discriminants d of the form m2 +4, which was studied by Yokoi in [21]. In particular, he
conjectured that h(m2 + 4) > 1 for all m > 17. Both Chowla’s and Yokoi’s conjectures
were settled by Bir´o in [1] and [2]. There are further generalizations of Chowla’s and
Yokoi’s families, commonly known as real quadratic ﬁelds of Richaud-Degert type. The
class number problem for these ﬁelds was studied by several authors, notably by Mollin
and Williams [14], [15].

Here and throughout we denote by Dch Chowla’s family of fundamental discrimi-

nants, deﬁned by

Dch := {d : d squarefree of the form d = 4m2 + 1 for m ≥ 1}.

We also let Dch(x) = {d ≤ x : d ∈ Dch}. Then it follows from Lemma 1 of [16] that
(1.2)

p2 (cid:19) + O(cid:0)x1/3 log x(cid:1) ,

where c(p) := 1 +(cid:16)−1

p(cid:17). If d ∈ Dch then the class number formula (1.1) becomes

|Dch(x)| =

(1.3)

h(d) =

√d

log(√d − 1 + √d)

L(1, χd),

since the fundamental unit is εd = 2m + √d if d = 4m2 + 1 is squarefree. Therefore,
assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis GRH, we have

log d log log d ≤ h(d) ≤ (4eγ + o(1))

for any d ∈ Dch, where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. These bounds follow from
the corresponding bounds for L(1, χd) obtained by Littlewood [13] under GRH. Note
that the upper bound in (1.4) holds for all real quadratic ﬁelds, since εd ≥ √d/2 for
Chowla’s family Dch was used by Montgomery and Weinberger [16] to produce real
quadratic ﬁelds with extremely large class numbers. More precisely, they proved that

all positive fundamental discriminants.

there are at least x3/8 discriminants d ∈ Dch(x) such that

h(d) ≫

This result was recently reﬁned by Lamzouri [11], who showed that there are at least
x1/2−1/ log log x discriminants d ∈ Dch(x) such that
√d
(1.5)
log d

h(d) ≥ (2eγ + o(1))

log log d.

The lower bound (1.5) is believed to be best possible over all positive fundamen-
tal discriminants d, in view of the widely believed conjecture that L(1, χd) ≤ (eγ +
o(1)) log log |d| for all fundamental discriminants d. Note that the true lower bound for

L(1, χd) is believed to be(cid:0)e−γζ(2)+o(1)(cid:1)/ log log |d|, which would imply a lower bound

for h(d) over d ∈ Dch that is twice as large as the GRH lower bound in (1.4). One can
refer to [6] for a discussion and results related to these conjectures.

In this paper, we shall investigate the distribution of h(d) over fundamental discrim-
inants d in Chowla’s family. With minor modiﬁcations, one can obtain similar results
for Yokoi’s family of real quadratic ﬁelds. Here and throughout we let logj be the j-fold
iterated logarithm; that is, log2 = log log, log3 = log log log and so on. Our main result
shows that the tail of the distribution of large (and small) values of h(d) over d ∈ Dch
is double exponentially decreasing. In particular, it implies (1.5).

Theorem 1.1. Let x be large, and 1 ≤ τ ≤ log2 x − 3 log3 x. The number of discrimi-
nants d ∈ Dch(x) such that

h(d) ≥ 2eγ √d

In view of the class number formula (1.3), the distribution of h(d) is completely de-
termined by that of L(1, χd) over d ∈ Dch. Our strategy is to compare the distribution of

L(1, χd) over d ∈ Dch to that of a random Euler product L(1, X) =Qp (1 − X(p)/p)−1 ,

4

ALEXANDER DAHL AND YOUNESS LAMZOURI

where the X(p)’s are independent random variables taking the values 0,±1 with suit-
able probabilities that are described below. One can think of the random variable X(p)
as a model for the value of χd(p) as d varies in Dch.

One should compare our results with those of Granville and Soundararajan [6]
concerning the distribution of values of L(1, χd) over all fundamental discriminants d
such that |d| ≤ x (their results also hold if one restricts attention to either positive
or negative discriminants). Although the probabilistic random model for this family
is diﬀerent from that of Chowla’s family (for arithmetic reasons that are explained
below), the tail of the distribution of these values satisfy a similar estimate to (1.6). In
particular, one can deduce from their results that the proportion of imaginary quadratic
(eγτ )−1) equals

ﬁelds Q(√−d) with d ≤ x such that h(−d) ≥
exp(cid:16)− eτ −C0

τ(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:17), in asymptotically the same range for τ . This shows a strong

similarity between the distribution of class numbers in Chowla’s family and that of class
numbers of imaginary quadratic ﬁelds.

and

The argument for choosing these probabilities is as follows: Let p be an odd prime. If
d = 4m2 + 1 is squarefree then d lies in one of p2 − c(p) residue classes modulo p2,
since p2 ∤ 4m2 + 1. Among these, χd(p) = 0 for exactly pc(p) − c(p) of them, which
justiﬁes the choice of γp. Now, concerning αp and βp, notice that they are completely
determined by the pair of equations αp + βp = 1− γp and αp − βp = − 1
p (1− c(p)/p2)−1.
The latter shows that there is a bias towards the value −1, which is explained by the
Jacobsthal sum identity (see for example [18])

We prove that the distribution of L(1, χd) over d ∈ Dch is very well approximated by
that of L(1, X) uniformly in almost all of the viable range.

In order to deduce Theorem 1.1, we need to study the asymptotic behaviour of the
distribution functions ΦX(τ ) and ΨX(τ ) in terms of τ when τ is large. We accomplish
this by a careful saddle point analysis.

0 ≤ λ ≤ e−τ , then we have
(1.10)

ΦX(cid:0)e−λτ(cid:1) = ΦX(τ )(cid:0)1 + O (λeτ )(cid:1), and ΨX(cid:0)e−λτ(cid:1) = ΨX(τ )(cid:0)1 + O (λeτ )(cid:1).

Our proof of Theorem 1.2 relies on computing complex moments of L(1, χd) over
d ∈ Dch. To this end, we show that the average of L(1, χd)z over Chowla’s family is
asymptotically equal to the corresponding moments of the probabilistic random model
L(1, X) uniformly in a wide range of the complex variable z.

Remark 1.5. The precise deﬁnition of an exceptional discriminant d is stated in (3.2).
Note that if d is exceptional, we could have L(1, χd) as small as d−ǫ, so that when
|z| is large and z < 0, the z-th moment of L(1, χd) would be heavily aﬀected by the
contribution of this particular discriminant. This justiﬁes the assumption that d is non-
exceptional in Theorem 1.4. Furthermore, it is known that these discriminants if they
exist must be very rare, in particular there are at most O(log x) of them less than x
(see for example [4]). Also, note that if Re(z) < 0 but |Re(z)| is bounded, we no longer
need the condition that d is non-exceptional in Theorem 1.4, thanks to Siegel’s bound
L(1, χd) ≫ǫ d−ǫ.

As an application of our results, we investigate the number of discriminants in the
family Dch with class number h, which we denote by Fch(h). The number of imaginary
quadratic ﬁelds with class number h was studied by Soundararajan in [17]. In particular,
he developed an asymptotic formula for its average value, a result whose error term
was improved upon in [12]. A variant of Soundararajan’s asymptotic formula (over
odd h) was recently used by Holmin, Jones, Kurlberg, McLeman and Petersen [8] to
investigate statistics of class numbers of imaginary quadratic ﬁelds.

By the class number formula (1.3), one expects that the main contribution to the
average of Fch(h) over h ≤ H comes from discriminants d of size ≪ H 2(log H)2, since
L(1, χd) is constant on average (by Theorem 1.4). Since there are ≍ H log H such
discriminants in Dch, this heuristic argument suggests that the average size of Fch(h)
should be around log h. We prove that this is indeed the case.

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we establish an asymptotic formula
for the average value of χd(m) over d in Dch(x). In particular, we show that in a certain
range of m in terms of x, the average order of χd(m) equals E(X(m)). This is used to
compute complex moments of L(1, χd) over d ∈ Dch(x) and prove Theorem 1.4 in
Section 3. In Section 4 we use the saddle-point method to study the distribution of the
random Euler product L(1, X) and prove Theorem 1.3. These results are then used to
prove Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 in Section 5. Finally, we apply our results to study Fch(h)
and prove Theorem 1.6 in Section 6.

2. An asymptotic formula for the character sum Pd∈Dch(x) χd(m)

In order to prove that the moments of L(1, χd) over d ∈ Dch(x) are nearly equal to
the corresponding moments of L(1, X), we ﬁrst need to show that the average order of
χd(m) equals E(X(m)) when m is small compared to x.

Proposition 2.1. Let m be a positive integer. Then we have

χd(m) = E(X(m)) + O(cid:0)m2/3x−1/6 log x(cid:1) .

To prove this result, we ﬁrst need the following lemmas. Here and throughout we

for some suﬃciently small constant c > 0. Then, we have the following standard bound
for log L(1+it, χ) (see for example Lemma 2.2 of [9]), which holds if χ is a non-principal
and non-exceptional primitive Dirichlet character modulo q

log L(1 + it, χ) ≪ log2(cid:0)q(|t| + 2)(cid:1).

We can obtain a much better bound for log L(s, χ), with s close to 1, if L(s, χ) has no
zeros in a certain rectangle containing s.

Lemma 3.1. Let q be large and put η = 1/ log2 q. Let 0 < ǫ < 1/2 be ﬁxed. Assume that
L(z, χ) has no zeros in the rectangle {z : 1 − ǫ ≤ Re(z) ≤ 1 and |Im(z)| ≤ 2(log q)2/ǫ}.
Then for any s = σ + it with 1 − η ≤ σ ≤ 1 and |t| ≤ log4 q we have

To prove this result we need the following lemma from [5].

| log L(s, χ)| ≤ log3 q + Oǫ(1).

Lemma 3.2 (Lemma 8.2 of [5]). Let s = σ + it with σ > 1/2 and |t| ≤ 2q. Let y ≥ 2
be a real number, and let 1/2 ≤ σ0 < σ. Suppose that the rectangle {z : σ0 < Re(z) ≤
1,|Im(z) − t| ≤ y + 3} contains no zeros of L(z, χ). Put σ1 = min( σ+σ0

that log q/ log2 q ≤ log y ≤ log q. Furthermore, assume that L(s, χ) has no zeros inside

We are now ready to prove Theorem 1.4.

Proof of Theorem 1.4. Let eDch(x) be the set of fundamental discriminants d ∈ Dch(x)
such that d > √x and L(s, χd) has no zeros in the rectangle {s : 9/10 < Re(s) ≤
1 and |Im(s)| ≤ 2(log x)20}. To bound |Dch(x) \ eDch(x)| we use the following zero-

density result of Heath-Brown [7], which states that for 1/2 < σ < 1 and any ǫ > 0 we
have

X♭

|d|≤x

N(σ, T, χd) ≪ (xT )ǫx3(1−σ)/(2−σ)T (3−2σ)/(2−σ),

where N(σ, T, χd) is the number of zeros ρ of L(s, χd) with Re(ρ) ≥ σ and |Im(ρ)| ≤ T ,
indicates that the sum is over fundamental discriminants. Then, it follows

and X♭

from this bound that

|Dch(x)| − |eDch(x)| ≪ x1/3.

Using this estimate together with the bound (3.3) we obtain

L(1, χd)z ≪ x1/3 exp(cid:0)O(|z| log2 x)(cid:1) ≪ x3/8.

Let y = x1/6, and put k = ⌈|z|⌉. Then, it follows from Proposition 3.3 that

using an argument similar to (3.1). Therefore, we deduce that the error term in (3.6)

4.1. Main results and proof of Theorem 1.3. Throughout this section, we shall

Let τ be a large real number and consider the equation

(4.2)

(cid:16)E (L(1, X)r) (eγτ )−r(cid:17)′ = 0 ⇐⇒ L′(r) = log τ + γ,

where the derivative is taken with respect to the real variable r. Then it follows from
Proposition 4.2 below that limr→∞ L′(r) = ∞. Moreover, a simple calculation shows
that E′′p (r)Ep(r) > (E′p(r))2 for all primes p, and hence that L′′(r) > 0. Thus, we
deduce that equation (4.2) has a unique solution κ = κ(τ ). Using a careful saddle
point analysis we obtain an asymptotic formula for ΦX(τ ) in terms of the moment
E (L(1, X)r) evaluated at the saddle point κ.

Theorem 4.1. Let τ be large and κ denote the unique solution to (4.2). Then, we have

using this fact together with (4.4) imply (1.10).

The remaining of this section will be devoted to the proofs of Theorem 4.1 and

Proposition 4.2. We begin by proving the latter.

Now if p > r2/3, we use that αp− βp ≪ 1/p and γp ≪ 1/p, together with the bounds
cosh(t) − 1 ≪ t cosh(t) and sinh(t) ≪ t cosh(t), which are valid for all t ≥ 0. Thus we
derive

(4.12)

Ep(r) =(cid:0)αper/p + βpe−r/p(cid:1)(cid:18)1 + O(cid:18) r

if t ≥ 1.

Then we have the following standard estimates for f and f′.

0 ≤ t < 1. Moreover we have

|t| ≥ √r log r. To this end, we establish the following lemma, which is the analogue of

Lemma 3.2 of [6].

Lemma 4.5. Let r be large. If p > r/4, then for some positive constant b1 we have

|Ep(r + it)|

18

ALEXANDER DAHL AND YOUNESS LAMZOURI

Proof. Let x1, x2, x3 be positive real number numbers, and θ2, θ3 be real numbers. We
shall use the following inequality which is established in the proof of Lemma 3.2 of [6]:

(cid:12)(cid:12)x1 + x2eiθ2 + x3eiθ3(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ (x1 + x2 + x3) exp(cid:18)−

x1x3(1 − cos θ3)

(x1 + x2 + x3)2(cid:19) .

Indeed, applying this inequality with x1 = αp(1 − 1/p)−r, x2 = γp, x3 = βp(1 + 1/p)−r,
and θ2 = t log(1 − 1/p), and θ3 = t log(p − 1/p + 1) yields the desired bound, since
p > r/4.

Using this lemma, we deduce the following result.

Lemma 4.6. Let r be large. Then, there exists a constant b2 > 0 such that

|E (L(1, X)r+it)|

E (L(1, X)r) ≪

t2

exp(cid:16)−b2
r log r(cid:17)
log |t|(cid:17)
exp(cid:16)−b2 |t|

if |t| ≤ r/4
if |t| > r/4.

Proof. Let z = r + it. Since |Ep(z)| ≤ Ep(r) we obtain that for any real numbers
2 ≤ y1 < y2
(4.16)

.

Moreover, note that |t| log(cid:16) p+1

|Ep(z)|
Ep(r)

|E (L(1, X)z)|

E (L(1, X)r) ≤ Yy1≤p≤y2
p−1(cid:17) ∼ 2|t|/p, whence for |t| ≤ p/4 we have
1 − cos(cid:18)t log(cid:18) p + 1

p − 1(cid:19)(cid:19) ≫ |t|2

p2 .

If |t| ≤ r/4 we choose y1 = r and y2 = 2r. Then, appealing to Lemma 4.5 gives the
desired bound in this case. Finally, in the case |t| > r/4, we use the same argument
with y1 = 4|t| and y2 = 8|t|.

(cid:3)

Let ϕ(y) = 1 if y > 1 and equals 0 otherwise. To relate the distribution function
of L(1, X) (or that of L(1, χd) over d ∈ Dch(x)) to its complex moments, we use the
following smooth analogue of Perron’s formula.

We now prove (4.4). Let 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1/κ be a real number. Then, by (4.18) we have

We write s = κ + it, and split the above integral into two parts |t| ≤ √κ log κ and
|t| > √κ log κ.
Note that both |(eλs − 1)/λs| and |(eλs − e−λs)/λs| are always less than 4, which
is easily seen by looking at the cases |λs| ≤ 1 and |λs| > 1 separately. Therefore, it
follows that the contribution of the ﬁrst part is ≪ λ√κ log κ · E (L(1, X)κ) (eγτ )−κ.

5. The distribution of values of L(1, χd) over d ∈ Dch(x): Proof of

indicates that the sum is over non-exceptional discriminants d.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. As in Section 4, let κ be the unique solution to L′(r) = log τ +γ.
Let N be a positive integer and 0 < λ < min{1/(2κ), 1/N} be a real number to be
chosen later.

Let Y = b log x/(log2 x log3 x), for some suitably small constant b > 0. If x is large
enough then equation (4.8) insures that κ ≤ Y in our range of τ . Also, note that

The result follows from these estimates together with the fact that ΦX(τ ) ≫ x−1/4 in

6. The number of quadratic fields with a given class number: Proof

of Theorem 1.6

Recall that Fch(h) is the number of discriminants in the family Dch with class

number h. In order to obtain an asymptotic formula forPh≤H Fch(h), we ﬁrst show that

we can restrict our attention to discriminants d ∈ Dch such that d ≤ X := H 2(log H)8.

24

ALEXANDER DAHL AND YOUNESS LAMZOURI

Indeed, if d ≥ X and h(d) ≤ H then by the class number formula (1.3) we must
have L(1, χd) ≪ 1/(log H)3. However, it follows from Tatuzawa’s reﬁnement of Siegel’s
Theorem [19] that for large d, we have L(1, χd) ≥ 1/(log d)2 with at most one exception.
Therefore, we obtain

Then we have h(d) = ℓ(d)L(1, χd) by the class number formula (1.3). Hence, using

= E(cid:0)L(1, X)−1(cid:1) H log H + O(H log2 H).

Furthermore, a similar argument shows that

Combining these estimates with with equations (6.2), (6.5), (6.6) and (6.7) we deduce

Replacing eλN H by H in the right hand side inequality yields

≪ H(log2 H)2 log3 H.

E(cid:0)g2(eλN Y )1/2 − g0(Y )1/2(cid:1) =(cid:0)eλN − 1(cid:1) E(cid:0)L(1, X)−1(cid:1) H log H + O(H log2 H)
Fch(h) ≤ C1E(cid:0)L(1, X)−1(cid:1) H log H + O(cid:0)H(log2 H)2 log3 H(cid:1) ≤ Xh≤eλN H

Fch(h) = C1E(cid:0)L(1, X)−1(cid:1) H log H + O(cid:0)H(log2 H)2 log3 H(cid:1).
