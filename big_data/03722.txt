The interband optical response of a three-dimensional Dirac cone is linear in photon energy (Ω).
Here, we study the evolution of the interband response within a model Hamiltonian which contains
Dirac, Weyl and gapped semimetal phases. In the pure Dirac case, a single linear dependence is
observed, while in the Weyl phase, we ﬁnd two quasilinear regions with diﬀerent slopes. These
regions are also distinct from the large-Ω dependence. As the boundary between the Weyl (WSM)
and gapped phases is approached, the slope of the low-Ω response increases, while the photon-energy
range over which it applies decreases. At the phase boundary, a square root behaviour is obtained
which is followed by a gapped response in the gapped semimetal phase. The density of states parallels
these behaviours with the linear law replaced by quadratic behaviour in the WSM phase and the
square root dependence at the phase boundary changed to |ω|3/2. The optical spectral weight under
the intraband (Drude) response at low temperature (T ) and/or small chemical potential (µ) is found
to change from T 2 (µ2) in the WSM phase to T 3/2 (|µ|3/2) at the phase boundary.

INTRODUCTION

(3D)

Dirac and Weyl semimetals are a class of three-
dimensional
systems which posses nontrivial
topology1–4. Recently, such materials have been stud-
ied by angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and
scanning tunnelling microscopy5–17. By breaking time-
reversal symmetry or spatial-inversion symmetry, the
double degeneracy of a Dirac node is broken and two
Weyl nodes emerge. These are separated in either mo-
mentum or energy space18. The simplest Hamiltonian
which captures this physics describes a semimetal with a
3D electronic band structure where the energy is directly
proportional to the crystal momentum via an isotropic
Fermi velocity vF . More speciﬁcally, ˆH0 = ¯hvF σ·k, with
σ = (ˆσx, ˆσy, ˆσz), the usual vector of Pauli-spin matrices.
Such a Hamiltonian leads to an ac optical interband
response which is linear in photon energy19,20 (Ω) and
passes through the origin in the limit Ω → 0. This
unusual
linear behaviour is widely considered to be
an important optical signature of 3D Dirac materials21
and represents the generalization of the well-known con-
stant interband background of graphene and similar two-
dimensional (2D) materials22–27. In 2D, the background
is universal,
independent of any material parameters
while in 3D, the linear background is inversely propor-
tional to the Fermi velocity. An early observation of the
linear optical background was that of Chen et al.28 in
ZrTe5 where the linear regime was found to extend over
∼ 150 meV. Furthermore, the pyrochlore Eu2Ir2O7 dis-
plays a linear optical conductivity which extrapolates to
the origin29; however, it exists over a much smaller range
of frequency (∼ 12 meV). The recent work of Xu et al.21
on the Weyl semimetal (WSM) TaAs shows two linear re-

gions: one below ∼ 30 meV which extrapolates to the ori-
gin, and a second which extends over ∼ 125 meV with a
much reduced slope. Before these recent studies, Timusk
et al.19 considered older optical data in some known qua-
sicrystals and provided a possible interpretation in terms
of Dirac or Weyl points. All the materials they consid-
ered had a linear conductivity with some extrapolating to
a positive intercept on the conductivity axis while others
cut the photon axis at Ω > 0. Some showed two lin-
ear regions. It is clear from such data that the optical
properties of 3D Dirac materials display a rich pattern
of behaviour and such studies are expected to provide
important information about the electronic properties of
these semimetals.

While TaAs and NbAs are WSMs with broken spacial-
inversion symmetry4, YbMnBi2 has broken time-reversal
symmetry6. The simplest Hamiltonian which can de-
scribe the latter case consists of augmenting ˆH0 to in-
clude a momentum shift Q. Similarly, the former system
is modelled by adding an energy shift Q0 such that the
energy of the Weyl nodes is diﬀerent but their position
in momentum space is unchanged. Generally, the Hamil-
tonian becomes30 ˆH = ¯hvF σ · (χk − Q) + ˆIχQ0, where
χ = ± is the chirality of the Weyl node and ˆI is the
unit matrix.
In this paper, we limit our discussion to
the time-reversal symmetry breaking system but employ
a more realistic Hamiltonian. Here, the degeneracy of
the Dirac cones is lifted and the two Weyl nodes sit at
diﬀerent locations in momentum space (although remain
degenerate in energy).

In a recent preprint, Koshino et al.31 have studied
the magnetic properties of 3D nodal semimetals within
a three parameter model which involves the Fermi veloc-
ity, a Dirac mass parameter m, and an intrinsic Zeeman-

ﬁeld-like parameter b which can arise in magnetic sys-
tems. This model has a rich phase diagram. A WSM
exists when b > m while a gapped semimetal (GSM) is
present for b < m. For b = m = 0, the ordinary Dirac
semimetal (DSM) is obtained; along the m axis (b = 0),
the energy spectrum is gapped but the degeneracy of the
Dirac cones in not lifted. A variation of this low-energy
Hamiltonian has very recently been employed by Chen et
al.32 in the interpretation of their magneto-infrared data
in ZrTe5. Here, we will use this Hamiltonian to study
the ac optical response with particular emphasis on the
WSM region of the phase diagram as well as the phase
boundary between the WSM and GSM.
Our paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. II, we
introduce our low-energy Hamiltonian and discuss its
phase diagram and underlying electronic dispersion. In
Sec. III, we derive analytic equations for the ac interband
background and describe the modiﬁcations from linearity
brought about through the introduction of m and b. The
details needed to compute the longitudinal conductivity
are given in App. A. Section IV deals more speciﬁcally
with the optical response at the phase boundary m = b
and includes a discussion of the Drude optical spectral
weight. The electronic density of states and speciﬁc heat
is examined in Sec. V. Conclusions follow in Sec. VI.

II. THEORETICAL FORMALISM

We begin with the low-energy Hamiltonian31–33

ˆH = ¯hvF ˆτxσ · k + mˆτz + bˆσz

(1)

where vF , m and b are material dependent parameters.
They are the Fermi velocity, a mass parameter32, and a
Zeeman-like term, respectively. Such a Hamiltonian is
derived in the supplemental information of Ref.32. Here,
σ and τ are two 3D vectors of Pauli matrices. ˆH can be
cast as a 4x4 matrix, giving four energy bands (particle-
hole symmetric conduction and valence bands). The en-
ergy dispersion is

εss′ (p) = sqm2 + b2 + (vF p)2 + 2bs′p(vF pz)2 + m2,
where s = ± for the conduction and valence band, re-
spectively, s′ = ± and p = ¯hk is the momentum. For
b = 0, εss′ = spm2 + (vF p)2 which is doubly-degenerate
in s′ and gives the dispersion of massive Dirac fermions.
Deﬁning vF p/b ≡ ¯p and m/b ≡ ¯m,

In Fig. 1, we plot εss′ /b vs. vF pz/b at px = py = 0.
For convenience, s = + as the valence band is mirror-
symmetric.
In frame (a), we consider the WSM phase
with b > m and four values of ¯m. Namely: ¯m = 0 (solid
black), ¯m = 0.4 (dashed red), ¯m = 0.7 (dash-dotted

blue), and ¯m = 0.9 (double-dash-dotted green). For ¯m =
0 (solid black), Eqn. (3) reduces to εss′ /b = s|1 + s′|¯pz||
for which the s′ = − branch has zeros at ¯pz = ±1 and
is equal to 1 at ¯pz = 0. This branch contains two Weyl
nodes and an inverted cone in between. The s′ = +
has a single Dirac node but it vertically displaced in en-
ergy by one unit. Together, these two branches can be
relabled and described as two identical cones, symmet-
rically displaced to the right and left along the ¯pz axis.
For m 6= 0, we get εss′ /b = s|1 + s′p ¯m2 + ¯p2
z| where
again px = py = 0. This has a value of s|1 + s′ ¯m| at

¯pz = 0. That is, s(1 − m/b) for s′ = − and s(1 + m/b)
for s′ = +. The degeneracy in s′ is lifted and two bands
of the same line-type and colour are observed. One is
gapped at ¯pz = 0 (s′ = +) while the other (s′ = −) dis-
plays two nodes as a function of momentum. Note that
the separation of the nodes in ¯pz decreases with increas-
ing m, as does the dome height at ¯pz = 0. Speciﬁcally,

the nodes are located at ¯pz = ±p1 − m2/b2 while the
height of the dome (measured from ε/b = 0) is 1 − m/b.
Figure 1(b) emphasizes the phase boundary at m = b.
Here, only s′ = − is plotted. For ¯m < 1 the system is
in the WSM phase and we see the two node structures
which characterize the WSM [ ¯m = 0.95 (dashed red) and
¯m = 0.99 (dash-dotted purple)]. For ¯m = 1.02 (double-
dash-dotted blue), the system is a GSM and ε−/b has a
gap which tends towards zero as ¯m tends to unity (the
phase boundary).

s′ = ± bands are degenerate (coloured purple) but are
gapped; however at the origin (m = b = 0), a degenerate
Dirac cone exists. In all cases, ε < 0 is mirror symmetric.

INTERBAND CONDUCTIVITY

In App. A, we derive the longitudinal optical conduc-
tivity σxx(Ω) via the Kubo formula in the clean limit.
Both intraband and interband transitions are considered.
The intraband component gives rise to the Drude contri-
bution which is proportional to a Dirac δ-function in the
absence of impurity scattering. The interband transitions
yield a linear background as previously mentioned. For
m = b = 0, at charge neutrality and zero temperature, it
is20

for a single Dirac cone, where e is the elementary charge.
The interband background is inversely proportional to
the Fermi velocity, linear in Ω, and zero at Ω = 0. This
is to be contrasted with the 2D case of graphene for which
the background is universal and equal to (π/2)e2/h.

For ﬁnite m, b and T the interband conductivity is

Both s′ = ± energy bands are gapped, one with a height
of m + b (s′ = +) and the other with m − b (s′ = −)
which is clearly illustrated in Fig. 2.
For the WSM (b > m), the s′ = + branch is given by
the same formula as Eqn. (16). For s′ = −, the function

In both cases, we get (4/3)Ω2. Therefore, the conductiv-
ity is the same as for m = b = 0 [Eqn. (11)] as expected
since we are dealing with two identical cones which are
simply displaced in momentum. This shift in pz can be
eliminated through a simple change of variables in mo-
mentum space.

Results for the WSM phase are shown in Fig. 3(a) for
ﬁve values of m/b < 1. The dotted black curve (m = 0)
is for comparison and is simply a straight line through
the origin. Note that all quantities have been scaled by

by the green arrows for µ = 0. Above Ω/b = 2(1 − m/b), no
transitions occur in the region between the Weyl nodes. This
yields the reduced slope seen in frame (a).

note a quasilinear regime extending to Ω/b = 2(1− m/b)
followed by a second quasilinear regime extending to
Ω/b = 2(1 + m/b), above which a gap feature emerges
and the conductivity converges with the m = 0 curve
as Ω → ∞. While there are deviations from two per-
fect straight lines, they are rather minor. This behaviour
holds for the other values of m/b. As this parameter is
increased, the frequency regime over which the ﬁrst line
is seen shrinks while that over which the second line ex-
ists increases. To understand the main features of the
curves, we refer to the schematic band structure shown

5

in frame (b). The valence (red) and conduction (blue)
bands are shown for px = py = 0 as a function of vF pz/b.
Arrows illustrate the various optical transitions that can
occur at charge neutrality (µ = 0). They range from
zero to large photon energies. Note, however, that those
originating from −1 < vF pz/b < 1 have a maximum at
Ω/b = 2(1 − m/b). At this frequency, the conductiv-
ity shows a kink and rises much more slowly after this
energy.

It is instructive to consider how the slope of σIB

xx(Ω)
out of Ω = 0 changes with m/b. We return to Eqn. (14).

We will restrict our attention to s′ = − as this is the
only branch which displays WSM behaviour, with two
Weyl points on the ˜pz axis for ˜px = ˜py = 0. As
we are interested in the low-Ω dependence, only tran-
sitions in the vicinity of the Weyl nodes are present.
Therefore, we expand ˜pz about the two nodes located

at ˜pzc = ±√b2 − m2. We change variables from ˜pz to
ˆpz ≡ ˜pz − ˜pzc and work to lowest order in ˜pz. The energy

slope of the WSM interband conductivity [Fig. 3(a)] is
altered from the dotted line (m = 0) by a factor of

nodes and hence, a degeneracy factor of two. The same
result can be obtained from our analytic formula for the
conductivity written in Eqn. (17). This is veriﬁed in the
numerical results of Fig. 3(a). For m = b 6= 0, which de-
ﬁnes the phase boundary between the WSM and GSM,
both Eqns. (16) (for m > b) and (17) (for m < b) in-
volve the same G−(p(b + Ω/2)2 − b2). For Ω → 0, the
argument of this function is √bΩ (to leading order) while
it is Ω/2 if b = 0. Thus, the interband conductivity at
the phase boundary for small Ω follows a Ω1/2 law as op-
posed to the linear-in-Ω behaviour of b = 0 (DSM). We
will return to this discussion in Sec. IV.

So far, we have restricted our attention to charge neu-

for the interband conductivity including ﬁnite T and µ
for the WSM (m/b = 0.7). The solid black curve is for
reference and displays the µ = 0, T = 0 result. It can
be described qualitatively as two quasilinear regimes of
diﬀerent slope: the ﬁrst (below Ω = 2(b − m)) going
through the origin and having a slope of approximately

FIG. 4. (Color online) Interband optical response of the WSM

Finite T smears this step and a ﬁnite response is observed
below Ω = 2µ.

3.5 times greater than the second region. This quasilin-
ear line extrapolates to cut the vertical axis at ∼ 0.02
in our units. The thermal factor in Eqn. (8) reduces to
the Heaviside step function Θ(Ω − 2|µ|) at T = 0. For
ﬁnite µ, this cuts oﬀ the zero-µ curve at Ω = 2|µ| below
which it is zero and above which it is unchanged from the
charge neutral value. This is clearly seen by the dotted
red and blue curves for µ/b = 0.2 and 1, respectively.
The dashed black curve is for µ = 0 and T /b = 0.1. We
note the depleting of the optical spectral weight at small
frequencies and a decrease in the van Hove kink structure
at Ω = 2(b− m). Spectral weight at ﬁnite T is, of course,
transferred to the low-energy Drude which is not shown
in the ﬁgure. For the dash-dotted red curve, the chemical
potential is ﬁnite and cuts the low-energy region below
Ω/b = 0.4 at T = 0 (which falls in the ﬁrst quasilinear
region). However, ﬁnite T smears the step which depletes
the response above Ω = 2µ and provides a ﬁnite value be-
low. For the dash-dotted blue curve, Ω/b = 2µ = 2 falls
in the second quasilinear region of the optical spectrum
and here the temperature smearing is more prominent.

IV. OPTICAL SIGNATURES OF THE PHASE

BOUNDARY

We now turn to a closer examination of the conductiv-
ity across the WSM-GSM phase boundary (b ≈ m). In
Fig. 5(b)-(d), we show illustrative plots of the three im-
portant band structures for the s′ = − energy branch as
a function of vF pz/b. Both valence and conduction bands
are shown and key optical transitions are indicated by ar-

through the WSM to GSM phase transition. For m/b < 1, the
system is a WSM and a quasilinear slope persists to Ω = 0.

rows for µ = 0. Frame (b) applies to the WSM (b > m)
and shows two Weyl nodes along the pz axis. Frame (c) is
the phase boundary (b = m) and the conduction and va-
lence band touch at zero energy but are quadratic in pz.
In frame (d), the GSM is shown (b < m) in which case
the s′ = − band is gapped. For the WSM, optical transi-
tions of inﬁnitesimal energy transfer are possible around
the Weyl nodes at vF pz/b = p1 − (m/b)2. The transi-
tions about pz = 0 are limited to Ω/b = 2|1 − m/b|. For
b = m, there is no restriction on the length of the black
arrows. For the GSM, a minimum of Ω/b = 2|1 − m/b|
is required to excite charge carriers.
In Fig. 5(a), we
show the interband conductivity for m/b = 0.95 (dashed
red), m/b = 1 (solid black) and m/b = 1.05 (dash-dotted
blue). For the WSM, we see a linear low-Ω response per-
sist to Ω = 0. For the GSM, a clear gap is observed.
At high energy, the three curves converge as expected.
At the phase boundary (b = m), the low-Ω behaviour

goes like √Ω. Therefore, each regime gives a very diﬀer-
ent Ω → 0 behaviour, providing a clear signature of the
diﬀerent phases.
It is also useful to brieﬂy discuss the intraband con-
tribution (Drude) to the conductivity.
It is given by
Eqn. (A12) which applies to the clean limit and can be
written as

which is quadratic in ω. For the GSM (b < m),

At charge neutrality and ﬁnite T , WD ∝ T 3/2. For the
GSM phase (m > b), the Drude is thermally activated
and WD ∝ exp(−[m − b]/T ).

V. DENSITY OF STATES

It is also instructive to look at the electronic density
of states (DOS) which contains the energy conserving δ-
function present in the interband conductivity, but not
the associated matrix element. By deﬁnition, the DOS
(in the continuum limit) is

Ns′ (ω) =

1

¯h3 Xs Z

d3p
(2π)3 δ(ω − εss′ ).

(27)

From this deﬁnition, we see that Ns′(ω) = Ns′ (−ω) and,
hence, the DOS is particle-hole symmetric and only de-
pends on |ω|. For εss′ = svF p, we immediately get the
known result34

Fq(|ω| + b)2 − b2,

(32)

which goes as |ω|3/2 for ω → 0, provided b 6= 0.
If b
is taken to be zero ﬁrst, we ﬁnd instead a ω2 power-
law as expected for a DSM. The three diﬀerent low-ω
behaviours are shown in Fig. 6 for several representative
values of m/b. Here, N (ω) is the sum of N±(ω). Frame
(a) is restricted to the WSM phase. The solid black curve
is for m = 0 and is for comparison. In this case, N−(ω)
of Eqn. (31) reduces to

N−(ω) =

ω2

2π2¯h3v3
F

(33)

which gives the result for the simple Dirac model. As
m increases, there is little diﬀerence with the solid black
curve until ω/b approaches 1 − m/b (0.8 for m/b = 0.2
[dashed red] and 0.3 for m/b = 0.7 [dash-dotted blue])
where the second term in Eqn. (31) drops out. Well below
this value, the curve is quadratic, but carries an m/b
dependent coeﬃcient. The ω → 0 limit is

N (ω)/b2 =

(ω/b)2
2π2¯h3v3
F

p1 − (m/b)2

.

(34)

This result nicely parallels the interband conductivity.
In frame (b), we show additional results which high-
light the phase transition. Namely, m/b = 0.95 (dashed
red), m/b = 1 (solid black) and m/b = 1.05 (dash-
dotted blue). The most signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
the curves occur at small ω/b. The WSM has a cusp at
ω/b = 1− m/b while the GSM has a gap. The solid black
curve is continuous and goes like |ω|3/2 at small ω while
the WSM is ∝ ω2 as previously noted.
The low-ω dependences of the DOS imply diﬀerent
temperature laws for various thermodynamic and trans-
port properties. Here, we illustrate this with the speciﬁc

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have calculated the interband optical response of
relativistic Fermions within a model Hamiltonian which
displays three phases. One phase contains doubly de-
generate Dirac cones gapped by m. There is also a
Weyl phase (WSM) for which the degeneracy has been
lifted by a Zeeman-like magnetic parameter b. Here, the
two cones are centered at diﬀerent points in momentum
space. Finally, there exists a semimetal phase (GSM)
which is characterized by two distinct gaps. An impor-
tant aim of our work is to establish characteristics of the
various phases which can be elucidated by the optical
response. For the doubly degenerate Dirac semimetal
(DSM), the optical background is linear in Ω and in-
versely proportional to the Fermi velocity (vF ) of the
relativistic electron dispersion. For the WSM, the Ω → 0
behaviour remains linear in Ω but the associated vF is
reduced by a factor of p1 − (m/b)2. This region ex-
tends up to photon energies equal to 2(b− m) over which
range it remains quasilinear. This is followed by a sec-
ond quasilinear region up to Ω = 2(b + m) at which point
a second gapped band begins to contribute and the re-
sulting Ω dependence becomes more complex. At large
Ω, the background converges with the linear response of
the DSM. As the boundary between the WSM and GSM
is approached (m = b), the slope of the optical back-

ground tends toward inﬁnity as 1/p1 − (m/b)2 while, at
the same time, the photon-energy range over which this
law applies shrinks to zero as 2(b − m) (b ≥ m). At
the phase boundary, we ﬁnd a square root dependence
(∝ Ω1/2) for the low energy response (Ω → 0). On the
other side of the phase diagram, the response is that of
a gapped Dirac cone.

For ﬁnite chemical potential (µ) away from charge neu-
trality, the interband conductivity remains unchanged
over its µ = 0 value except a sharp cutoﬀ appears at
Ω = 2|µ|. This holds for any value of µ, independent
of whether or not it falls in the ﬁrst or second quasilin-
ear region. Finite temperature smear out this step and,
consequently, introduces thermal tails below Ω = 2|µ|.
We also ﬁnd it instructive to calculate the density
of states (DOS). Its evolution is found to parallel the
optical conductivity. For the WSM,
its ω → 0 be-
haviour is quadratic in ω and remains quasiquadratic un-
til ω = b − m with its coeﬃcient modiﬁed by the same
1/p1 − (m/b)2 factor as in the optics. At the phase
boundary (b = m), the low-energy power-law becomes

|ω|3/2 before a gap opens for the GSM. This variation in
the ω → 0 DOS implies changes in the low-temperature
speciﬁc heat which goes from ∝ T 3 for the WSM to
∝ T 5/2 at the phase boundary, followed by an exponential
activated response for the GSM phase. Similarly, we ﬁnd
that the optical spectral weight of the Drude conductivity
in the WSM phase is the same as the Dirac semimetal up

to a factor of 1/p1 − (m/b)2 for T < b − m. For b = m,
the Drude weight goes like |µ|3/2 at T = 0, and T 3/2 at
charge neutrality. This is distinct from both the WSM
and GSM.
