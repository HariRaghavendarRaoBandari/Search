Abstract

Triangle-hinge models [arXiv:1503.08812] are introduced to describe worldvolume
dynamics of membranes. The Feynman diagrams consist of triangles glued together
along hinges and can be restricted to tetrahedral decompositions in a large N limit. In
this paper, after clarifying that all the tetrahedra resulting in the original models are
orientable, we deﬁne a version of triangle-hinge models that can describe the dynamics
of unoriented membranes. By regarding each triangle as representing a propagation of
an open membrane of disk topology, we introduce a local worldvolume parity transfor-
mation which inverts the orientation of triangle, and deﬁne unoriented triangle-hinge
models by gauging the transformation. Unlike two-dimensional cases, this local trans-
formation generally relates a manifold to a nonmanifold, but still is a well-deﬁned
manipulation among tetrahedral decompositions. We further show that matter ﬁelds
can be introduced in the same way as in the original oriented models. In particular,
the models will describe unoriented membranes in a target spacetime by taking matter
ﬁelds to be the target space coordinates.

The worldvolume theory of membranes in a spacetime is equivalent to a system of three-
dimensional quantum gravity coupled to matter ﬁelds corresponding to the target space
coordinates. One approach to treating such class of systems is the use of models that
generate three-dimensional random volumes. Triangle-hinge models [1] are proposed as such
models. The dynamical variables are given by a pair of N × N symmetric matrices, A and
B, and the Feynman diagrams consist of triangles glued together along their edges. We can

1

restrict diagrams such that they represent only three-dimensional tetrahedral decompositions
by taking a large N limit. The simplest model thus obtained corresponds to discretized
three-dimensional pure quantum gravity with a bare cosmological constant. We can further
introduce extra degrees of freedom representing the target space coordinates. A prescription
to introduce such matter degrees of freedom to triangle-hinge models is given in [2]. The
prescription also enables us to describe various spin systems such as the q-state Potts models
coupled to quantum gravity, and to realize colored tensor models [3, 4] in terms of triangle-
hinge models.

As pointed out in [1], the original triangle-hinge models generate only (and all of the) ori-
entable tetrahedral decompositions. In this paper, we generalize the models such that unori-
ented membranes can be treated. We will call the obtained models unoriented triangle-hinge
models. In the context of string theory, to consider unoriented models is not just interest-
ing as a mathematical generalization, but has a physically important meaning. Actually,
an unoriented superstring theory, type I superstring, is one of (perturbatively) consistent
superstring theories. We expect that unoriented membrane theory is also physically impor-
tant.1

In two-dimensional cases, an unoriented theory is obtained by gauging the worldsheet
parity of an oriented theory. If we discretize worldsheets by triangular decompositions, the
gauging procedure is to treat equally two ways to identify an edge of a triangle with that
of another triangle; one way preserves the local orientations of two triangles and the other
does not. We will deﬁne unoriented membrane theories by generalizing the prescription
to three-dimensional tetrahedral decompositions. Roughly speaking, the unoriented models
equally treat two possible ways to identify a triangle of a tetrahedron with that of another
tetrahedron; one way preserves the orientation and the other does not.

Here, we make comments on the treatment of orientability in other three-dimensional
random volume theories, tensor models. Tensor models [5, 6, 7] are natural generalizations
of matrix models to higher dimensions. One can introduce various kinds of tensor models [6]
depending on how indices of rank-3 tensors are assigned to triangles in tetrahedral decom-
positions.2 A class of models, where each index is assigned to a vertex of a triangle, generate
only orientable tetrahedral decompositions [6]. Although, by modifying the models, we may
be able to construct unoriented models, it is diﬃcult to solve them. Analytical treatment of

1We should comment that the low energy eﬀective theory of unoriented supermembranes is not the
eleven-dimensional supergravity, because the 3-form ﬁelds in the supergravity multiplet cannot couple to
unoriented membranes. Nevertheless, we expect that unoriented membrane theory serves as a toy model to
obtain a better understanding of dynamics of membranes.

2 There is another type of tensor model (called the canonical tensor model) which realizes the constraints
in the canonical quantization of gravity [8, 9, 10]. An interesting connection to random tensor networks is
studied in [11, 12].

2

tensor models is improved in colored tensor models [3, 4]. The models only generate tetrahe-
dral decompositions belonging to a speciﬁc class.3 This restriction enables us to take a 1/N
expansion of the free energy [14, 15]. Furthermore, in the so-called invariant models [16] one
can take the double scaling limit [17, 18]. It can be shown that tetrahedral decompositions
generated by colored tensor models are orientable. However, if we try to modify the models
to unoriented ones, the solvability of the models may be lost.

Original triangle-hinge models are expected to be solvable because the dynamical vari-
ables are matrices. In fact, for simple models (such as the models characterized by matrix
rings), the interaction terms in the action can be rewritten to the traces of powers of matrices
[19]. Thus, in order to reduce the systems to those of eigenvalues, we only need to inte-
grate the exponential of the quadratic term in the action over the angular parts of matrices.
Moreover, numerical integrations [19] show that the eigenvalue distributions of matrices A
and B have a similar structure to those of one-matrix models with double-well potentials,
and that the eﬀective theory of eigenvalues for either of matrix A or B has critical points.
Since there are integration contours for which the matrix integrations are ﬁnite [19], it is
highly expected that the original oriented triangle-hinge models have well-deﬁned contin-
uum limits. We will see that the actions of unoriented triangle-hinge models have a similar
structure to the original ones, and thus we expect that unoriented triangle-hinge models are
also solvable and might be easier to solve due to the higher symmetry they have.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we review triangle-hinge models and
show that the tetrahedral decompositions generated by the models are orientable. In section
3, after reviewing matrix models for unoriented strings, we deﬁne unoriented membrane
theories in terms of tetrahedral decompositions. In section 4, we give a version of triangle-
hinge models that realize unoriented membrane theories. In section 5, we show that matter
ﬁelds can be introduced also to unoriented triangle-hinge models by the same procedure as
[2]. Section 6 is devoted to conclusion.

2. Orientability in triangle-hinge models

In this section, we clarify the fact that the original triangle-hinge model [1] generates the
set of oriented tetrahedral decompositions.

2.1. Brief review of triangle-hinge models

Triangle-hinge models [1] are designed to generate Feynman diagrams each of which can be
regarded as a collection of triangles glued together along multiple hinges and will eventually

The free energy is given by

F = logZ dA dB e−S[A,B] ,

and if we expand F with respect to λ and µk, each term is expressed by a group of Wick
contractions as usual. There are two types of interaction vertices; one (coming from λ [CA3])
corresponds to a triangle and the other (coming from µk[YkBk]) to a multiple hinge (see
Fig. 2). The coeﬃcients C ijklmn and Yi1j1...ikjk are real constant tensors, and we will not

The two terms on the right-hand side in (2.3) express that there are two ways to connect
an edge of a hinge to an edge of a triangle as shown in Fig. 3. We regard the two types

AB(+) or simply as AB(+) and the second type as AB(−) = AB(−), where we have omitted
the indices i, j, . . ..7 Then, a group of Wick contractions (denoted by x) can be speciﬁed

[CA1A2A3] by [CA2A3A1]) leads to a diﬀerent group of Wick contractions.

indicates that they belong to the I-th contraction

In [1], we investigated in detail the case where the interaction terms µk[YkBk] are char-
acterized by a semisimple associative algebra A. Let a basis of A be {ei} (i = 1, . . . , N),

6In fact, when multiplied by Ai1 j1 Ai2j2 Ai3j3 (Aij = Aji), only fully symmetric part of C i1 j1i2j2i3j3 survive
that are invariant under interchanges of indices iα and jα (α = 1, . . . , 3) and under permutations of three
pairs of indices (i1j1), (i2j2), (i3j3), so we could have assumed that the tensor C in (2.1) have the symmetry
C i1j1i2j2i3j3 = C i2 j2i3j3i1j1 = C j1i1i2j2i3j3 = C i2j2i1j1i3j3 . We, however, do not assume this symmetry and
regard contractions using C i1 j1i2j2i3j3 , C i2j2i3j3i1j1 , C j1 i1i2j2i3j3 or C i2j2i1j1i3j3 as giving independent Wick
contractions [1, 2]. Note that only the fully symmetric part is actually left when all the diagrams are
summed. The same argument is applied to the hinge parts.

7Of course, the two pairs appear in a combined way as AB(+) + AB(−).

Yi1j1...ikjk ≡ yi1...ikyjk...j1 ,

Yi1j1...ikjk = Yi2j2...ikjki1j1 = Yjkik...j1i1 .

(2.7)

(2.8)

In order to restrict conﬁgurations so as to represent only tetrahedral decompositions,
we consider the case where the algebra A is a matrix ring A = Mn=3m(R) with n being a
multiple of three [1]. The dimension of A is then given by N = n2 = (3m)2. We take a
basis {ei} to be {eab} (a, b = 1, . . . n), where eab are the matrix units whose (c, d) elements
are (eab)cd = δacδbd. Note that indices i are replaced by double indices ab. Then, the rank k
tensors (2.6) are given by

yi1i2...ik = ya1b1, a2b2,..., akbk = n δb1a2 · · · δbk−1ak δbka1 ,

(2.9)

which in turn give the k-hinge tensor Yi1j1i2j2...ikjk as

We here introduce some terminology to discriminate between a group of Wick contrac-
tions and a Feynman diagram. We have already clariﬁed our rule about Wick contractions.
We now introduce an equivalence relation to the set {x} of groups of Wick contractions,
saying that a group x of Wick contractions is equivalent to another group y (and writing
x ∼ y) if x is obtained from y by repetitive use of the relations (2.8) and (2.13) and by
permuting interaction vertices of the same type. We denote the equivalence class of x by
[x] = {y | y ∼ x}, and call γ = [x] a Feynman diagram. The perturbative expansion of the

free energy is then given by a sum over connected Feynman diagrams γ, F =Pγ F (γ) . In

a connected diagram, every index line makes a loop since all the indices are contracted.

contracted with g1 and h2, respectively, giving (ω2)d1a5.

2.2. Restriction to tetrahedral decompositions

Although conﬁgurations generated in triangle-hinge models do not generally represent tetra-
hedral decompositions, the set of Feynman diagrams can be reduced such that they represent
only (and all of the) tetrahedral decompositions if we take a large n limit with n/λ and n2µk
ﬁxed [1].9 The point is the following. We have tr ωℓ when ω appears ℓ times in an index
loop (see Fig. 5), and thus F (γ) is given by

F (γ) =

S(γ)(cid:16) λ

n3(cid:17)s2(γ)(cid:20)Yk=1

(n2µk)sk

2(γ).

(2.16)

1 (γ)(cid:21) Yℓ=1

2(γ) denotes the numbers of index ℓ-gons in diagram γ.10 s2(γ) and sk

Here, tℓ
1(γ) denote
the number of triangles and k-hinges in diagram γ, respectively, and S(γ) is the symmetry
factor. Due to the deﬁnition of matrix ω, we have

tr ωℓ =( n

0

(ℓ = 0 mod 3)
(ℓ 6= 0 mod 3).

(2.17)

Thus, there can survive only the diagrams with ℓ a multiple of three (ℓ ≡ 3ℓ′), and we can
assume (2.16) to take the form

F (γ) =

1

S(γ)

λs2(γ)(cid:20)Yk≥1

(n2µk)sk

1 (γ)(cid:21) n−3s2(γ)+Pℓ′≥1 t3ℓ′

2 (γ) .

(2.18)

One can show that only the index polygons with ℓ = 3 (i.e. ℓ′ = 1) survive in the limit
n → ∞ with n/λ and n2µk ﬁxed [1]. We here give a proof in a form slightly diﬀerent from

9The set of tetrahedral decomposition can be further restricted so as to represent manifolds by extending

the algebra A as having a center to count the number of vertices [1].

10An index loop is called an index ℓ-gon if it consists of ℓ intervals, each living on a side of an intermediate

triangle [1].

the original one such that it can be applied to unoriented models. We ﬁrst note that the
2 (γ) = 6s2(γ) holds because the left-hand side counts the number of ω
in diagram γ and each thickened triangle has six insertions of ω. Then, if we introduce
2 (γ) ≥ 0, we have the relation d(γ) =

relation Pℓ′≥1 3ℓ′t3ℓ′
a nonnegative quantity d(γ) ≡ Pℓ′≥1 3(ℓ′ − 1)t3ℓ′
6s2(γ) − 3Pℓ′≥1 t3ℓ′

2 (γ). Thus, λs2(γ) can be rewritten as

λs2(γ) = λ− 1

3 d(γ)λ3s2(γ)−Pℓ′≥1 t3ℓ′

2 (γ) .

(2.19)

.

(2.20)

Substituting this expression to (2.18), F (γ) is expressed as

F (γ) =

1

S(γ)

λ− 1

3 d(γ)(cid:20)Yk≥1

(n2µk)sk

1 (γ)(cid:21)(cid:16) n

λ(cid:17)−3s2(γ)+Pℓ′≥1 t3ℓ′

2 (γ)

Therefore, in the limit n → ∞ with n/λ and n2µk ﬁxed (and thus λ → ∞), only the diagrams
satisfying d(γ) = 0 can give nonzero contributions to the free energy. Since d(γ) = 0 means
that all the index polygons in γ are triangles, we conclude that the large n limit reduces the
set of diagrams so that all the index polygons are triangles. One can further prove that such
diagrams represent tetrahedral decompositions [1], as may be understood intuitively from
the fact that if there is an index triangle, then sides of thickened triangles must be attached
as in Fig. 6.11

Figure 6: An index triangle made on three sides of thickened triangles, which
form a corner of a tetrahedron.

We end this subsection with a comment. The above argument can also be applied to
unoriented models to be deﬁned in the next section. Namely, if a set of diagrams is reduced
such that all the index polygons are triangles, then the diagrams represent tetrahedral
decompositions even for unoriented models.

2.3. Orientability

It is pointed out in [1] that all the tetrahedral decompositions generated by the action (2.14)
are orientable. We here give a detailed proof of this statement, by clarifying the deﬁnition
of orientation for Feynman diagrams in a triangle-hinge model.

11Note that there is ω at each corner of a side of a thickened triangle.

9

We ﬁrst recall that a thickened triangle has two triangular sides, on each of which directed
index lines are drawn [see Fig. 4 (a)]. Given a tetrahedron T formed by four triangular sides
(each coming from a thickened triangle), we embed it to a three-dimensional Euclidean
space E3 as a regular tetrahedron of unit volume. Note that there can be two embeddings
f + and f − (up to rotations and translations in E3), depending on whether the directions
of index lines are counterclockwise or clockwise when seen from the center of the embedded
tetrahedron (see Fig. 7).12 We say the former embedding to be positive and the latter

bedding of T in E3.

negative. We then deﬁne an oriented tetrahedron T ± to be the pair of tetrahedron and
embedding, T ± ≡ (T, f ±).

1 and T +

When two positively oriented tetrahedra T +

2 are glued at a triangle ∆, we say
that the orientation is preserved if the two positive embeddings f +
2 can be extended
(with the use of rotations and translations) to a common embedding f of T +
such
that the images of two tetrahedra are in opposite positions with respect to the intermediate
triangle ∆ (see Fig. 8). We then say that a tetrahedral decomposition Γ is orientable if the
orientation is preserved for any two adjacent tetrahedra of positive orientation.

1 and f +

1 ∪ T +
2

The above orientability condition actually holds for tetrahedral decompositions discussed
in the previous subsection. In fact, the index lines on the two sides of a thickened triangle
are drawn in opposite directions as in Fig. 4 (a), and thus, for any two adjacent tetrahedra
there always exists a natural extension of their positive embeddings such that the images of
two tetrahedra are in opposite positions with respect to the triangle. Since it holds for every
two adjacent tetrahedra, we conclude that all the tetrahedral decompositions are orientable.

12Note that if the directions of index lines are counterclockwise for one side, they are also counterclockwise

for the other three sides because index lines are connected in such a way that the direction is preserved.

3. Unoriented membrane theories

In this section, we deﬁne unoriented membrane theories in terms of tetrahedral decomposi-
tions. A realization of unoriented membrane theories within the framework of triangle-hinge
models will be given in the next section.

3.1. Matrix models for unoriented strings

As a warm-up before discussing unoriented membrane theories, we review the deﬁnition of
unoriented string theories and how some of them are realized in terms of real symmetric
matrix models.

We ﬁrst recall that an oriented open string is an oriented one-dimensional object with
two ends. If we forget about the target-space degrees of freedom, the scattering processes
of oriented open strings are represented by Feynman diagrams of Hermitian matrix models:

where M = (Mij) = M † is an N × N Hermitian matrix. In fact, the propagator and the

S[M] = tr(cid:16) 1

propagator :

∼ δilδjk (cid:0)= MijMkl(cid:1),

interaction :

∼ λ δjk δlm δni .

(3.2)

(3.3)

Each Feynman diagram can also be thought of as a triangular decomposition of an orientable
two-dimensional surface by representing it with the dual diagram.

We now introduce a transformation Ω which acts on one-string states and inverts the
worldsheet parity (the orientation of string). Unoriented open string theories are then deﬁned
as theories where the transformation Ω is gauged (see, e.g., [20]). Namely, we demand that
every propagator in the open-string channel be invariant under the action of Ω . This is
realized by inserting the projector (1 + Ω)/2 to every propagator. If we do not change the
form of interaction, the Feynman rules are then expressed as follows (we have rescaled the
projector for later convenience):

propagator :

+

∼ δilδjk + δikδjl (cid:0)= XijXkl(cid:1),

interaction :

∼ λ δjk δlm δni.

(3.4)

It is easy to see that the above Feynman rules are obtained from a real symmetric matrix
model:

X 3(cid:17),

where X = (Xij) = X T is an N × N real symmetric matrix.

A Feynman diagram for the above unoriented string theory can also be represented as
a collection of triangles glued together along two-hinges. In fact, if we express the vertex
C ijklmn (only with a cyclic symmetry) by an oriented triangle, the two contractions in (3.4)
can be illustrated as in Fig. 9. The ﬁrst contraction leads to a gluing of two oriented triangles

13Note that in tr(M 3) = C ijklmnMijMklMmn, only such components of C ijklmn survive that are totally
symmetric under the permutation of three pairs of indices, (ij), (kl), (mn). However, when we write
C ijklmn = δjkδlmδni , we intensionally think that C ijklmn are only cyclically symmetric for three pairs of
indices, and distinguish two diagrams, one coming from C ijklmn and the other from C klijmn. Of course,
by summing two ways of Wick contractions in calculating the free energy, the two diagrams appear in a
combined way and C ijklmn will be automatically symmetrized. This “trick” enables us to identify a Feynman
diagram with a triangulated surface, and is widely and implicitly adopted in the study of matrix models.

orientation is not preserved.

3.2. Unoriented membrane theories

In the previous subsection, we have seen that unoriented string theories are obtained from
oriented theories by gauging the worldsheet parity transformation Ω. We now apply the
same prescription to membrane theories in order to deﬁne unoriented membrane theories;
We ﬁrst prepare oriented models and introduce the worldvolume parity transformation Ω
that inverts the orientation of open membrane, and then gauge the transformation Ω by
inserting (1 + Ω)/2 to every propagator of open membrane in the original oriented models.
In the rest of this paper, we assume that worldvolumes in oriented models are already
represented as tetrahedral decompositions.

3.2.1. Open membranes of disk topology as fundamental objects

We ﬁrst argue that the worldvolume dynamics of oriented closed membranes of various
topologies can also be regarded as that of oriented open membranes of disk topology. In fact,
tetrahedra in a tetrahedral decomposition can be thought of as interaction vertices that are
connected with propagators of membrane of disk topology (i.e. triangles). One thus may say

13

that a worldvolume theory of closed membranes of arbitrary topologies has a dual picture
where open membranes of disk topology play fundamental roles, despite the fact that open
membranes can have topologies other than disk (such as disks with handles).

Note that the orientation of a tetrahedron naturally induces the positive orientation for four
triangles belonging to the tetrahedron, and we represent them by arrows as in Fig. 10 (a).
We express the identiﬁcation of edges at ∆ as

(b): (E1E2E3) = (E′

hedra induce two-dimensional orientations of the triangles to be identiﬁed. The
identiﬁcation (b) can also be expressed as (b1) or (b2). The expression (b2)
is necessarily accompanied by the orientation change of the right tetrahedron,
which means that the local three-dimensional orientation is not preserved when
one moves from the left tetrahedron to the right tetrahedron across the identiﬁed
triangle.

∆1 and ∆2 must be opposite in order to form an oriented tetrahedral decomposition, and
thus the three-dimensional orientation is preserved when one moves from the inside of T1 to
that of T2 through the identiﬁed triangle ∆ [Fig. 10 (a)]. Three-dimensional orientation is
also preserved for the two other tetrahedral decompositions that are obtained from (3.7) by

14

cyclically permuting the edges (E′

tetrahedral decompositions corresponding to the three edge-identiﬁcations that preserve the
orientation,

3.2.3. Deﬁnition of unoriented membrane theories

In addition to the edge-identiﬁcations (3.8) [leading to the fundamental triplet (Γ1, Γ2, Γ3)] ,
we introduce another triplet (˜Γ1, ˜Γ2, ˜Γ3) that are obtained, respectively, by the following
edge-identiﬁcations at the same triangle ∆ :

˜Γ1 : (E1E2E3) = (E′

(3.9)

Note that, in contrast to (3.8), three-dimensional orientation is not preserved across ∆ [see
Fig. 10 (b)]. We introduce a transformation Ω that interchanges two triplets (Γ1, Γ2, Γ3) and
(˜Γ1, ˜Γ2, ˜Γ3), and deﬁne unoriented membrane theories to be those that are obtained from
the oriented theories by acting the projection operator (1 + Ω)/2 on every triangle. We will
call the set (Γ1, Γ2, Γ3, ˜Γ1, ˜Γ2, ˜Γ3) the fundamental sextet associated with triangle ∆ . So far
we have assumed that the tetrahedral decomposition Γ1 is orientable, but one can easily
see that Γ1 is not necessarily orientable for the above deﬁnition of a sextet to make sense
because we focus only on local conﬁgurations around triangle ∆. In the rest of paper, we
understand that the domain of deﬁnition for Ω is extended so as to include nonorientable
tetrahedral decompositions.

Note that each sextet (Γ1, . . . , ˜Γ3) consists of both manifolds and nonmanifolds, unlike
the two-dimensional cases where Ω always relates a manifold to another manifold. In fact,
suppose that a tetrahedral decomposition Γ1 represents a three-dimensional manifold. Then,

4. Triangle-hinge models for unoriented membranes

4.1. Action and Feynman rules

In this section, we realize unoriented membrane theories as triangle-hinge models. We show
that they are obtained simply by replacing C = C+ in the original oriented models (2.14)
with C = C+ + C−:

(4.2)

We ﬁrst note that the interaction vertices corresponding to [C+AAA] and [C−AAA] can
be expressed by thickened triangles with directed index lines as in Fig. 11. Contractions

Figure 11: Interaction vertices corresponding to (a): [C+AAA] and (b): [C−AAA].
If C+ represents triangle-identiﬁcations which preserve three-dimensional local
orientation, C− represents triangle-identiﬁcations which do not preserve orienta-
tion.

using [C+AAA] yield the identiﬁcation of a triangle belonging to a tetrahedron with another
triangle belonging to an adjacent tetrahedron so that the orientation is preserved [see Fig. 11
(a)]. The two positively oriented tetrahedra thus reside in opposite positions with respect
to the thickened triangle, and the edges (a1, d1), (a2, d2), (a3, d3) will be identiﬁed with the
edges (b1, c1), (b2, c2), (b3, c3), respectively, when we deﬂate the triangle to get a tetrahedral
decomposition. On the contrary, contractions using [C−AAA] yield an identiﬁcation of
triangles where the orientation is not preserved [see Fig. 11 (b1,b2)]. In fact, the indices

16

of C− [see (4.2)] can be expressed as Fig. 11 (b1) or (b2). We use the expression (b1)
in a Feynman diagram where the triangle is connected to hinges, but we exploit the other
expression (b2) when the thickened triangle is interpreted as representing two triangles to be
identiﬁed in gluing two tetrahedra of positive orientation. Then, the edges (a1, d1), (a2, d2),
(a3, d3) will be identiﬁed with the edges (c1, b1), (c2, b2), (c3, b3), respectively, when we deﬂate
triangles to get a tetrahedral decomposition. It is easy to see that the two positively oriented
tetrahedra are now in the same position with respect to the triangle and thus will take a
conﬁguration of Fig. 8 (b1) after the triangle is deﬂated. This means that the orientation is
not preserved for this gluing of tetrahedra.

Note that the direction of arrows on index lines is still preserved for diagrams using
C−. Thus, taking the same large n limit as in the oriented models, we can reduce the set
of diagrams such that all their index polygons are triangles,14 and can conclude that they
represent tetrahedral decompositions.

4.2. Wick contractions corresponding to the fundamental sextet

Recall that for each triangle ∆ in a tetrahedral decomposition Γ = Γ1, we have the fun-
damental sextet of tetrahedral decompositions, (Γ1, Γ2, Γ3, ˜Γ1, ˜Γ2, ˜Γ3), which close among
themselves under the action of Ω .
In this subsection, we write down the corresponding
sextet (γ1, γ2, γ3, ˜γ1, ˜γ2, ˜γ3) in unoriented triangle-hinge models.

1), E2(= E′

We ﬁrst note that, while the total number of triangles (as well as that of tetrahedra)
is the same among the sextet (Γ1, . . . , ˜Γ3), this is not the case for those numbers around
each edge of triangle ∆ . For example, let us consider the case where the three edges of ∆
in Γ1 [denoted by E1(= E′
3)] are connected to three diﬀerent hinges.
If we change the identiﬁcation at ∆ from (E1E2E3) = (E′
3E′
1)
to obtain Γ2, all the three edges E1, E2, E3 must be the same due to triangle-identiﬁcations
at other triangles.15 Therefore, Feynman diagrams γ1 and γ2 in a triangle-hinge model
must have diﬀerent numbers and diﬀerent types of hinges if they correspond to Γ1 and Γ2,
respectively. This means that the constructions of sextets are not so straightforward in
triangle-hinge models compared to other models (such as tensor models).

Let us make the above consideration to a more concrete form, considering a triangle ∆
in a tetrahedral decomposition Γ1, at which two positively oriented tetrahedra glued with
the orientation being preserved. We ﬁrst note that there are the following three cases for

14As in the original models, a tetrahedron has one index triangle at each corner (see Fig. 6).
15Since we assume that Γ is a tetrahedral decomposition without boundaries, other triangle-identiﬁcations

the three edges I, J, K of triangle ∆:

(1) Three edges I, J, K are connected to three diﬀerent hinges.

(2) Two and only two of them are connected to the same hinge.

(3) All of them are connected to the same hinge.

(4.3)

We suppose that Γ1 is of the type (1) at ∆, and that edges I, J, K are connected to (p + 1)-,
(q + 1)-, (r + 1)-hinges, respectively. Including p other edges connected to the (p + 1)-hinge,
we label the edges around the (p + 1)-hinge as [I, I1, . . . , Ip] in a cyclic order. Here, we
deﬁne the cyclic ordering of edges around a k-hinge as follows (see Fig. 12): We ﬁrst pick

Figure 12: Labeling of edges around a k-hinge.

up two neighboring triangles t1 and t2 belonging to the same tetrahedron T +
1 of positive
orientation, and label their edges connected to the hinge as L1 and L2, respectively. Next to
T +
1 there is another positively oriented tetrahedron T +
2 determined by triangle t2 and another
triangle t3 sharing the same hinge, and we label as L3 the edge of t3 that is connected to
the hinge. Repeating this procedure, we obtain a sequence [L1, L2, . . . , Lk] around the k-
hinge. Since another choice (t2, t3) is possible as the initial pair for the same conﬁguration of
edges around the hinge, we should regard the above sequence as being cyclically symmetric,
[L1, L2, . . . , Lk] = [L2, L3, . . . , Lk, L1]. Note that, if we take (t2, t1) as the initial pair, the
edges around the k-hinge will be represented as a sequence in reverse order, [Lk, . . . , L2, L1].

Labeling similarly the edges around the (q + 1)- and (r + 1)-hinges by [J, J1, . . . , Jq] and

[K, K1, . . . , Kr], respectively, we have

Γ1 : edge I is connected to a (p + 1)-hinge as [I, I1, . . . , Ip],

edge J is connected to a (q + 1)-hinge as [J, J1, . . . , Jq],

edge K is connected to a (r + 1)-hinge as [K, K1, . . . , Kr].

(4.4)

Then, the remaining tetrahedral decompositions in the sextet have the following conﬁgura-

18

tions:

Γ2 : three edges I, J, K are connected to a single (p + q + r + 3)-hinge

as [I, I1, . . . , Ip, K, K1, . . . , Kr, J, J1, . . . , Jq].

Γ3 : three edges I, J, K are connected to a single (p + q + r + 3)-hinge

as [I, I1, . . . , Ip, J, J1, . . . , Jq, K, K1, . . . , Kr].

(4.5)

(4.6)

˜Γ1 : two edges I, K are connected to a (p + r + 2)-hinge as [I, I1, . . . , Ip, K, K1, . . . , Kr],

and edge J is connected to a (q + 1)-hinge as [J, J1, . . . , Jq].

(4.7)
˜Γ2 : two edges J, K are connected to a (q + r + 2)-hinge as [J, J1, . . . , Jq, K, K1, . . . , Kr],
(4.8)

and edge I is connected to a (p + 1)-hinge as [I, I1, . . . , Ip].

˜Γ3 : two edges I, J are connected to a (p + q + 2)-hinge as [I, I1, . . . , Ip, J, J1, . . . , Jq],

and edge K is connected to a (r + 1)-hinge as [K, K1, . . . , Kr].

(4.9)

Equations (4.4)–(4.9) can be understood in the following way. We begin with (4.4), which
is simplest and obvious. We ﬁrst split the triangle ∆ in Γ1 to two triangles as in Fig. 13
1E′
in order to realize the conﬁguration before the edge-identiﬁcation (E1E2E3) = (E′
2E′
3)
is made. This splitting is accompanied by that of edge I to two edges E1 and E′
1, and

1, and edge J (or K) becomes E2 and E′

Figure 13: The splitting of ∆ corresponding to Γ1. Edge I becomes two edges
E1 and E′
3). The (p+1)-
, (q + 1)-, (r + 1)-hinges accordingly become (p + 2)-, (q + 2)-, (r + 2)-hinges,
respectively. Γ1 is restored by the edge-identiﬁcation (E1E2E3) = (E′
3) for
the split triangles.

2 (or to E3 and E′

2 (or to E3 and E′

that of edge J (or K) to E2 and E′
3). Accordingly, the (p + 1)-, (q + 1)-
(r + 1)-hinges are transformed to (p + 2)-, (q + 2)- (r + 2)-hinges, respectively. Now we
follow the sequence of the edges connected to each hinge in the other way around. If we
start from the edge E1 connected to the (p + 2)-hinge, we then pass through the edges
I1, . . . , Ip following the original sequence [I, I1, . . . , Ip], and reach the edge E′
1, which will be
identiﬁed with the starting edge E1 (i.e., E′
1 = E1 = I) under the edge-identiﬁcation for Γ1,
(E1E2E3) = (E′

3). Let us write the total path schematically as a cycle,

1E′

2E′

• E1 → I1 → · · · → Ip → E′

1 = E1.

(4.10)

19

Similarly, if we start from the edge E2 connected to the (q + 2)-hinge or from the edge E3
connected to the (r + 2)-hinge, we then have the following paths:

• E2 → J1 → · · · → Jq → E′
• E3 → K1 → · · · → Kr → E′

2 = E2,
3 = E3.

(4.11)

(4.12)

Equations (4.10)–(4.12) are exactly what is expressed in (4.4).

Now we consider the tetrahedral decomposition Γ2, which was obtained from Γ1 by
changing the edge-identiﬁcation from (E1E2E3) = (E′
1) [see
Fig. 14 (a)]. If we start from the edge E1 connected to the (p + 2)-hinge, we then again

pass through the edges I1, . . . , Ip and reach the edge E′

follow another sequence of edges, K1, . . . , Kr, to reach E′
3 will be identiﬁed with
E2, we need to continue the journey; we pass through the edges J1, . . . , Jq to reach E′
2,
which ﬁnally will agree with the starting edge E1. The total path thus can be written as
the following cycle:

3. Since E′

• E1 → I1 → · · · → Ip → E′

1 = E3 → K1 → · · · → Kr

3 = E2 → J1 → · · · → Jq → E′

2 = E1.

(4.13)

1 = E3 = K, E′

Since E′
(4.13) can be written as (4.5). Similarly, (4.6) can be understood from the path:

2 = E1 = I under the edge-identiﬁcation, the path

3 = E2 = J and E′

• E1 → I1 → · · · → Ip → E′

1 = E2 → J1 → · · · → Jq

→ E′

2 = E3 → K1 → · · · → Kr → E′

3 = E1.

(4.14)

Equation (4.7) can be understood in a similar way, by recalling that ˜Γ1 is obtained from

Γ1 by changing the edge-identiﬁcation from (E1E2E3) = (E′

3) to (E1E2E3) = (E′

[see Fig. 14 (b)], which gives the following two disconnected cycles:

• E2 → J1 → · · · → Jq → E′

1 = E3 → K1 → · · · → Kr → E′
2 = E2.

3 = E1,

Similarly, the cycles for ˜Γ2 [edge-identiﬁcation (E1E2E3) = (E′

• E2 → J1 → · · · → Jq → E′
• E1 → I1 → · · · → Ip → E′

2 = E3 → K1 → · · · → Kr → E′

3 = E2,

and those for ˜Γ3 [edge-identiﬁcation (E1E2E3) = (E′

• E1 → I1 → · · · → Ip → E′

3 = E3.

Now that we understand in detail the conﬁgurations of the fundamental sextet (Γ1, . . . , ˜Γ3)
associated with triangle ∆, it is easy to translate (4.4)–(4.9) in terms of unoriented triangle-
hinge models, and we obtain the sextet of Feynman diagrams (γ1, . . . , ˜γ3) as the following

connected to ∆. The remaining part (denoted by XI1...Ip,J1...Jq,K1...Kr) is common among the
sextet (γ1, . . . , ˜γ3) and represents the other interaction vertices and their contractions.17 As
for diagrams γ1, γ2, γ3, the identiﬁcation at ∆ preserves the orientation as in Fig. 10 (a), and
thus we have used the vertex [C+AIAJ AK]. On the other hand, as for diagrams ˜γ1, ˜γ2, ˜γ3,
the identiﬁcation at ∆ does not preserve the orientation as in Fig. 10 (b), and thus we
have used the vertex [C−AIAJ AK]. In Appendix A we prove that the diagrams γ2, . . ., ˜γ3
represent tetrahedral decompositions if γ1 does.

So far we have assumed that the orientation is preserved at ∆ in Γ1 and also that Γ1
is of the type (1) in (4.3). For other cases, one can also obtain the corresponding sextets
(γ1, . . . , ˜γ3) in a similar way.

4.3. Example

To understand the meaning of the above sextet (4.18)–(4.23), let us consider a simple exam-
ple. We take a tetrahedral decomposition Γ1 of a three-sphere, consisting of two tetrahedra
glued together at their faces as shown in Fig. 15. Diagram γ1 representing Γ1 is realized by

Since the part given by X is common among the sextet, we have the same labeling of edges,

i(ai, di) (i = 1, 2, 3), and diagram γ2 takes the form shown in Fig. 17 (a1) and
(a2). In Fig. 17 (a2), the ordered indices (b1, c1) are connected to (g, f ) by index lines, and
(a2, d2) are connected to (h, e). Thus, as can be seen from Fig. 17 (b), edge E1(b1, c1) = (g, f )
will be identiﬁed with edge E′

We thus obtain the edge-identiﬁcation (E1E2E3) = (E′

edge E′

4.4. Note on the weights of diagrams

We comment that a sextet (γ1, γ2, γ3, ˜γ1, ˜γ2, ˜γ3) appears in the free energy with the same
coeﬃcients. By “the same coeﬃcients” we mean that the numerical factors of these diagrams
are the same except for powers of n, λ, µk if we treat the common part X as a set of
distinguished external vertices and sum over all diagrams representing the same tetrahedral
decomposition.

We note that, if a group x of Wick contractions represents a tetrahedral decomposition
and if all the interaction vertices are distinguished, then x contributes to the free energy

If there are nk internal k-hinges in a diagram,19 there are nk! diﬀerent contractions cor-
responding to the permutation of these hinges, since the external vertices are distinguished.
For each k-hinge, there are 2k ways to give the same diagram due to the symmetry of k-hinge
vertices. Thus, the numerical factor of each contraction, 1/(nk!(2k)nk), is compensated if we
sum these contributions. The numerical factor 1/6 of triangle ∆ is also canceled. Actually,
since C+ has the symmetry (2.13) there are six ways to give the same diagram. The above
computation ensures that three diagrams γ1, γ2, γ3 are generated with unit coeﬃcient in the
original triangle-hinge model. Furthermore, since C− also has the symmetry

˜γ1, ˜γ2, ˜γ3 are also generated with unit coeﬃcient in an unoriented model.

18The n dependence comes from the assumption that all the index polygons are triangles.

5. Matter ﬁelds in unoriented triangle-hinge models

In this section we show that matter ﬁelds can be introduced to unoriented triangle-hinge
models in the same way as the original triangle-hinge models [2]. We here focus on assigning
matter degrees of freedom only to tetrahedra, but the assignment can be done to simplices
of any dimensions as in [2].

Introducing matter degrees of freedom is realized by coloring each tetrahedron in tetra-
hedral decompositions. Actually, we only need to repeat the steps given in [2]. We ﬁrst
extend the algebra A to a tensor product of the form A = Agrav ⊗ Amat. Here, Agrav is
again Mn=3m(R), and we take Amat to be M|J |(R), where J is the set of colors. Now the
dynamical variables A, B have eight indices A = (Aabαβ,cdγδ), B = (Babαβ,cdγδ), where the
indices a, b, c, d correspond to Agrav, and α, β, γ, δ to Amat.20 Next we set the tensor C to
take the form C = C+ + C− (C± represents two ways to glue tetrahedra depicted in Fig. 11),
and assume that each has a factorized form C± = C±gravC±mat. Here, we set C±grav to the
form (4.1), and let C±mat take the following form:

where pα = (pβγ
α) is the projector to the α-th component and λαβ is a real constant.
Equations (5.1) and (5.2) mean that we insert pα to each index lines (as ω was inserted for
Agrav) and take a summation over α and β with weight λαβ. The Amat part of the interaction
vertex [C+A3] + [C−A3] can be illustrated as in Fig.19. Note that pα is common among three

index lines on each side of a triangle. Thus, one can say that each side of triangle has a
color.

20A and B are real-valued matrices symmetric with respect to the pair of indices, Aabαβ,cdγδ = Acdγδ,abαβ,

Babαβ,cdγδ = Bcdγδ,abαβ.

In this construction, the index function F (γ) of diagram γ is factorized to the form

F (γ) ≡ F (γ; A) = F (γ; Agrav)F (γ; Amat) ≡ Fgrav(γ)Fmat(γ),

(5.3)

and the factor Fgrav(γ) ensures that diagram γ represents a tetrahedral decomposition. The
index lines corresponding to Amat also form index triangles (see Fig.20). A tetrahedron

surrounded by four side of triangles with color α1, α2, α3, α4 gives the factor

(α1 = α2 = α3 = α4)
(otherwise).

(5.4)

This means that Fmat(γ) can take nonvanishing values only when four side of triangles of
each tetrahedron have the same color (say α), which enables us to say that the tetrahedron
has the color α. We thus succeed in coloring tetrahedra in γ.

If two tetrahedra with color α and β are glued at their faces, the face (corresponding to
C±mat) gives the factor λαβ. In this sense the coupling constants λαβ deﬁne a local interaction
between the color α and β [2]. If we take the set of colors, J , to be RD = {x} and let the
coupling constants λx,y (x, y ∈ RD) take nonvanishing values only around y as a function of
x, then x can be interpreted as the target space coordinates of a tetrahedron in RD. Since
neighboring tetrahedra are locally connected in RD, the model can describe the dynamics
of unoriented membranes embedded in RD.

6. Conclusion and outlook

In this paper, we ﬁrst deﬁned unoriented membrane theories in terms of tetrahedral decom-
positions, and then realized them as triangle-hinge models. Unoriented membrane theories
are obtained from oriented open membrane theories of disk topology by gauging the world-
volume parity transformation Ω. For each triangle ∆ in a tetrahedral decomposition, we have

27

introduced two types of triplets, (Γ1, Γ2, Γ3) and (˜Γ1, ˜Γ2, ˜Γ3), which respectively correspond
to two ways of identiﬁcation at ∆, (3.8) and (3.9). The transformation Ω is then deﬁned as
the interchange between (Γ1, Γ2, Γ3) and (˜Γ1, ˜Γ2, ˜Γ3). After gauging Ω, an unoriented mem-
brane theory treats all the tetrahedral decompositions in the sextet (Γ1, Γ2, Γ3, ˜Γ1, ˜Γ2, ˜Γ3)
equally.

An unoriented membrane theory is realized as a triangle-hinge model with the action
(4.1). It generates Feynman diagrams representing unoriented tetrahedral decompositions.
We gave explicitly in (4.18)–(4.23) the sextet of Feynman diagrams (γ1, . . . , ˜γ3) correspond-
ing to (Γ1, . . . , ˜Γ3), and showed that these six diagrams appear with unit coeﬃcient up to
factors of coupling constants if we treat the common part X as a set of distinguished external
vertices and sum over all Wick contractions giving the same diagram. We further showed
that matter degrees of freedom can be introduced to unoriented triangle-hinge models by
coloring tetrahedra as carried out in [2]. Although we only discussed the coloring of tetra-
hedra in this paper, we can set matter degrees of freedom to simplices of any dimensions
(i.e. tetrahedra, triangles, edges and/or vertices) as in [2].

We expect that unoriented triangle-hinge models are solvable at least at the same level of
the original oriented models [19], since the dynamical variables are the same type of matrices
and the actions have almost the same structure as the original oriented triangle-hinge models.
The unoriented models actually might be easier to solve than the original oriented models,
because the interaction term corresponding to a triangle has higher symmetry, which may
help us to carry out the path-integrals more analytically. It is interesting to study critical
behaviors of the models in both analytical and numerical ways.

A. Sextet as tetrahedral decompositions

In this Appendix, we show that the diagrams γ2, . . ., ˜γ3 represent tetrahedral decompositions
if γ1 does. Let us look into the indices in the group of Wick contractions (4.18). We label
, while we label those of AI1 as AaI1 bI1 cI1 dI1 or AcI1 dI1 aI1 bI1
the indices of BI1 as Ba′
according to σI1 = (+) or (−), so that we always have

We use a similar labeling for other AIi and BIi. Through the parts other than X in (4.18),
indices aI1, . . ., dKr of X are connected to each other by index lines. The other parts are
given by

[C+AI AJ AK] = AaI bI cI dI AaJ bJ cJ dJ AaK bK cK dK ωdI aJ ωdJ aK ωdK aI ωbK cJ ωbJ cI ωbI cK , (A.2)

Thus, by combining them with (A.1), the index lines connecting aI1, . . ., dKr are given by

(A.4)

One can ﬁnd that index lines out of X take the same form as (A.4) in diagrams γ2, . . .,
˜γ3. Since we assume that diagram γ1 represents tetrahedral decomposition Γ1, all the index
loops in γ1 make index triangles. Then, the index loops of γ2, . . ., ˜γ3 also must make only
index triangles because the index loops have the same form as those of γ1. We thus have
shown that the diagrams represent tetrahedral decompositions if γ1 does.
