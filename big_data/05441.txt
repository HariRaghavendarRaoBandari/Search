1 Introduction

Finding explicit solutions of nonlinear partial differential equation(NPDE)is one of the most important prob-

lems in mathematical physics. With the development of nonlinear science, many methods have been established by

mathematicians and physicists to study the integrability of NPDEs. Such as inverse scattering transformation[1, 2],

Painlev´e analysis[3, 4], classical and non-classical Lie group[5, 6], nonlocal symmetry[7–9], variable separation

approach[10, 11], and various function expansion methods[12, 13] etc. Recently, many scholars have studied the

problem of interaction solutions to NPDEs[14, 15], however, it is very difﬁcult to ﬁnd interaction solutions among

different types of nonlinear excitations except for soliton-soliton interactions.

It is known that Painlev´e analysis is an important method to investigate the integrable property of a given

NLEE, and the truncated Painlev´e expansion method is a straight way to provide auto-B¨acklund transformation

and analytic solution, furthermore, it can also be used to obtain nonlocal symmetries. Recently, by developing

the truncated Painlev´e expansion, Lou[16–19] deﬁned a new integrability in the sense of possessing a consistent

tanh expansion. This method is greatly valid for constructing various interaction solutions between different types

of excitations. For example, solitons, cnoidal waves, Painlev´e waves, Airy waves, Bessel waves etc. It has been

revealed that many more integrable systems are CTE solvable and posses quite similar interaction solutions which

can be described by the same determining equation with different constant constraints.

This paper is arranged as follows: In Sec.2, from the truncated Painlev´e expansion, the residual symmetry of

the HBK system is obtained, and the nonlocal symmetry group is found by the localization process. In Sec.3, Using

the CTE method, some interaction solutions between different types of excitations and corresponding images are

2 Nonlocal symmetries of (2+1)-dimensional HBK System

In this section, we concentrate on investigating the nonlocal symmetries of HBK system. The 2+1 dimensional

HBK system[21, 22],

uyt + 4(uxx + u3 − 3uux + 3uw)xy + 12(uv)xx = 0,
vt + 4(vxx + 3vu2 + 3uvx + 3vw)x = 0,
wy − vx = 0,

where u = u(x, y, t), v = v(x, y, t), w = w(x, y, t).

(1)

This system was ﬁrst obtained from the inner parameter dependent symmetry constraints of the KP equation.

When we take y = x, the system (1) is reduced to the usual (1+1)-dimensional HBK system.

For the HBK system(1), we take a truncated Painlev´e expansion,

u =

u0
φ

+ u1, v =

v0
φ2 +

v1
φ

+ v2, w =

w0
φ2 +

w1
φ

+ w2,

with u0, u1, v0, v1, v2, w0, w1, w2, φ being the functions of x, y, and t.

Substituting Eqs.(2) into system(1) and vanishing all the coefﬁcients of different powers of 1/φ, we have,

u0 = φx, v0 = −φxφy, w0 = −φ2

x, v1 = φxy, w1 = φxx.

(2)

(3)

Substituting Eqs.(2-3) into system(1) and setting the coefﬁcients of powers of 1/φ3 to zero, can obtain two

v2 = u1y,
φt = −12φxu2

1 − 12φxw2 − 12φxxu1 − 12φxxx,

(4)

where u1, v2, w2 are seed solution of the (2+1) dimensional HBK system. From the above standard truncated
Painlev´e expansion system(1), we have the following BT theorem and nonlocal symmetry theorem.

Theorem 1 If the function φ can be determined by the Eq.(4), then Eqs.(2) are just the solutions of the

(2+1)-dimensional HBK system(1).

Proof By direct veriﬁcation.

Theorem 2 The HBK system (1) has the residual symmetry given by

σu = φx, σv = φxy, σw = φxx,

(5)

where u, v, w and φ satisfy the non-auto BT.

Proof By direct veriﬁcation.

To ﬁnd out the symmetry group of the residual symmetry, study the Lie point symmetries of the whole

prolonged equation system instead of the single system(1). From (5), it can be apparently seen that the nonlocal

symmetry contains the space derivative of function φ. Then, to localize the nonlocal symmetry (5), we introduce

the following transformations.

φx = φ1, φxx = φ1x = φ2, φxy = φ1y = φ3, φy = φ4,

(6)

and assume that the vector of the symmetries has the form,

where X, Y, T, U, V, W, Ψ, Ψ1, Ψ2, Ψ3 are the functions with respect to x, y, t, u, v, w, φ, φ1, φ2, φ3, which means
that the closed system is invariant under the inﬁnitesimal transformations.

moreover, σu, σv, σw, σf , σf1 , σf2 , σf3 satisfy the linearized equations of (1), (4) and (6).

It is not difﬁcult to verify that the solution of (7) has the form,

12 (xF2tt(t) − F6t(t)) + 2wF2t(t),

X = F6(t) − xF2t(t), Y = c2 − F5(y), T = c1 − 3F2(t),
U = F1(y)φ1 + uF2t(t), V = F1y(y)φ1 + F1(y)φ3 + v(F2t(t) + F5y(y)),
W = F1(y)φ2 − 1
Ψ = −F1(y)φ2 + F3(y)φ + F4(y),
Ψ1 = −2F1(y)φφ1 + F3(y)φ1 + F2t(t)φ1,
Ψ2 = −2F1(y)φ2
Ψ3 = −2F1(y)φ1φ4 + F3(y)φ1 − 2F1(y)φ4φ1 + (F2t(t) + F3(y) + F5y(y) − 2F1(y)φ)φ3,
Ψ4 = −2F1(y)φφ4 + F3(y)φ + F4y(y) − F1(y)φ2 + (F3(y) + F5y(y))φ4,

1 + F3(y)φ2 − 2F1(y)φφ2 + 2F2t(t)φ2,

(7)

(8)

The results (8) show that the nonlocal symmetry (5) in the original space (x, y, t, u, v, w) has been success-

fully localized to a Lie point symmetry in the enlarged space (x, y, t, u, v, w, ψ, ψ1, ψ2, ψ3, ψ4) .

After succeeding in making the nonlocal symmetry(5) equivalent to Lie point symmetry (8) of the related

prolonged system, we can construct the explicit solutions naturally by Lie group theory. With the Lie point

symmetry(8), For the sake of simplicity, let F1(y) = 1, F2(t) = F3(y) = F4(y) = F5(y) = F6(t) = 0, by
solving the following initial value problem,

d¯u(ε)

dε = ¯φ3(ε), d ¯w(ε)

dε = ¯φ1(ε), d¯v(ε)
−2 ¯φ2
¯u(ε)|ε=0 = u, ¯v(ε)|ε=0 = v, ¯w(ε)|ε=0 = w, ¯φ(ε)|ε=0 = φ, ¯φi(ε)|ε=0 = φi(i = 1, 2, 3, 4),

dε = − ¯φ2(ε), d ¯φ1(ε)
dε = −2 ¯φ1(ε) ¯φ4(ε) − 2 ¯φ(ε) ¯φ3(ε), d ¯φ4(ε)

dε = −2 ¯φ(ε) ¯φ1(ε), d ¯φ2(ε)
dε =
dε = −2 ¯φ(ε) ¯φ4(ε) − ¯φ2(ε),

1(ε) − 2 ¯φ(ε) ¯φ2(ε), d ¯φ3(ε)

dε = ¯φ2(ε), d ¯φ(ε)

(9)

Then the solution of the initial value problem (9) leads to the following group theorem for the enlarged system.
Theorem 3 If {u, v, w, φ, φ1, φ2, φ3, φ4} is a solution of the prolonged system Eqs.(1)and (4), so

¯u(ε) = φ1
¯w(ε) = φ2w+φφ2−φ2
¯φ2(ε) = εφφ2−2εφ2
(1+εφ)3
is also a solution of Eqs.(1)and (4).

3 Exact solutions of 2+1-dimensional HBK System

In order to give solutions of system (1), one should solve the Eqs.(4). But to ﬁnd the general solution of (4)

for any ﬁxed u1, w2 is still quite difﬁcult. Fortunately, one can verify that the seed solutions u1, w2 are arbitrary
functions of x and t. Substituting u1 = u1(x, t), w2 = w2(x, t) into Eqs.(4), we have

v2 = 0,
φt = −12φxu2

1 − 12φxw2 − 12φxxu1 − 12φxxx,

In order to better understand the localized coherent structures of the (2+1) dimensional HBK system, we ﬁnd

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

it useful to apply the variable separation method to this system. We assume that

φ = a1p(x, t) + a2q(y, t),

and w2 is determining by the following form,
1 − 1

12a1px

w2 = −u2
q = F1 + F2,

(12a1pxxu1 + a2F1t + a1pt + 4a1pxxx),

where F1 = F1(t), F2 = F2(y).

Substituting Eqs.(3),(11),(12) in to (2)and get the exact solutions of the HBK system,

φ + u1,

u = φx
v = − φxφy
w = − φ2

φ2 + φxy
φ ,
φ2 + φxx

x

φ + w2,

where u1 are arbitrary functions of x, t, φ and w2 are determined by (11),(12) respectively.

Because (11) contain the arbitrary function p(x, t), so, there are abundant different structures to the solutions

of (13). In this section, we focus on soliton solutions and periodic wave solutions .

3.1 Soliton solution

If we select p(x, t) as some types of some smooth functions, we can construct exact soliton solutions of the

2+1 dimensional HBK system. For instance, if we select,

which leads to the single soliton solution of Eqs.(1). In order to study the properties of the solution, we plot the

structure of the solution with F1(t) = 1, F2(y) = y, u1 = 1, ω = 0.1,

p = sec h(ξ), ξ = x − ωt,

(14)

3.2 Multiple resonant soliton solutions

For the next studies, we will seek the other type of soliton solutions, i.e. resonant soliton solution which has

been widely studied. If we select p as,

p = −

(15)

Xi=1

via the (11) along with the solution (13), the (n+1) resonant soliton solutions of Eqs. (1) can be directly obtained.

In the nest section, we will seek various interaction solutions between different types of excitations.

4 Interaction solutions for the HBK system

For (2+1)-dimensional higher-order Broer-Kaup equations (1), the generalized tanh function expansion reads,

u = u0 + u1 tanh(f ),
v = v0 + v1 tanh(f ) + v2 tanh2(f ),
w = w0 + w1 tanh(f ) + w2 tanh2(f ),

(16)

where f is an undetermined function of x, y and t, and the expansion coefﬁcient u0, u1, v0, v1, v2, w0, w1, w2 will
be determined by vanishing the coefﬁcients of powers tanh(f ). Substituting expression (16) into (1) yields,

u1 = fx,
v0 = fxfy + u0y, v1 = fxy, v2 = −fxfy,
w0 = −12f −1
x (12u2
0fx − 8f 3
w1 = fxx, w2 = −f 2

and the function f and u0 only needs to satisfy,

x + 12u0fxx + ft + 4fxxx),

x

F (u0, f ) = 0.

(17)

(18)

(19)

Because the Eq.(19) is very prolix which can be seen in appendix, here omitting it. It is quite difﬁcult to ﬁnd

the general solution of u0, f of (18,19). For the sake of simplicity, we select u0 = 0, substituting the ansatz into
(18) we obtain,

fxxxy =

1
4

f −1
x (ftfxy − fxfyt − 8f 3

x fxy + 4fxxxfxy),

substituting the (20) into Eq.(19), then Eq.(19) simpliﬁed as,

8fxxxfxy + fxxxfxx − 8fxyf 3

x + ftfxy − fxfyt = 0.

The next work is to solve the Eq.(20), we get the following three types of exact interaction solutions.

Case 1: Variable separation solution

It is not difﬁcult to verify that Eq.(21) possesses the following variable separation solution,

which leads to the interaction solution of Eqs.(1),

f = f1(x) + f2(y) + f3(t),

(20)

(21)

(22)

u = f1x tanh(f ),
v = f1xf2y − f1xf2y tanh2(f ),
w = 1

1x (8f 3

12 f −1

1x − 4f1xxx − f3t + 12f1xf1xx tanh(f ) − 12f 3

1x tanh2(f )).

5

Remark 1: Due to the arbitrariness of function f1(x), f2(y), f3(t), we are able to construct many types of
exact interaction solutions. For instance, if we select f1(x) = k1x, f2(y) = k2y, f3(t) = k3t, then the exact
single soliton solution of the 2+1 dimensional HBK system can be obtained. If choose other type functions to

f1(x), f2(y), f3(t), we will get more interaction solutions of HBK system.

Case 2: The ﬁrst type of special soliton-cnoidal waves solution

By solving Eq.(21), we just obtain a special solution in the form,

f = sn(k1x + k2t, m1),

(23)

where k1, k2 are arbitrary constants and m1 is modulus of Jacobi elliptic function. Then the exact interaction
solution of the 2+1 dimensional HBK system can be obtained in the form,

u = k1CD tanh(S),
w = −k2
(k2 + 16k3

v = 0,

(24)

where S ≡ sn(k1x + k2t, m1), C ≡ cn(k1x + k2t, m1), D ≡ dn(k1x + k2t, m1).

The solution given in (24) denotes the analytic interaction solution between the soliton and the cnoidal peri-

odic wave.

Case 3: The second type of special soliton-cnoidal waves solution

We just write a special solution of the equation Eq.(21) in the form,

f = l0x + l1y + l2t + cF(sn(ω0x + ω1y + ω2t, m2), m2),

With the help of the Maple, substituting expression (25) into Eq.(21) yields,

f = l0x + l1y +

(25)

(26)

l0, l1, ω0, ω1, ω2 and c are arbitrary constants and m2 is modulus of Jacobi elliptic function. Substituting (26) into
(16) and the exact interaction solution of the HBK system can be obtained in the form,

u0 = v1 = w1 = 0,

If we assume that Eq.(21) equation has the following form solution,

(28)

where E(ξ, m) is incomplete elliptic integrals of the second kind,i.e. E(ξ, m) = R ξ

{λ0 = λ0, λ1 = λ1, λ2 = λ2, µ = µ, γ0 = γ0, γ1 = 0, γ2 = γ2, m3 = m3},

(29)

by substituting (28) and (29) into (16), the exact interaction solution of the HBK system can be obtained. Because

the results are similar to case 3, so here omitting it.

Remark 2: Interaction solution between the solitary wave and the cnoidal wave when the value of the Jacobi

elliptic function modulus is not equal to 1. This kind of solution can be easily applicable to the analysis of

physically interesting processes.

Remark 3: Using the theorem 3 and the results of above two sections, we can construct more group invariant

solutions of (2+1) dimensional HBK system.

5 Discussion and Summary

In summary, using the nonlocal symmetry method, the residual symmetries of (2+1)-dimensional higher order

Broer-Kaup system can be localized to Lie point symmetries after introducing suitable prolonged systems, and

symmetry groups can also be obtained from the Lie point symmetry approach via the localization of the residual

symmetries. By developing the truncated Painlev´e analysis, we using the CTE method to solve the HBK system.

It is found that the HBK system is not only integrable under some nonstandard meaning but also CTE solvable.

Some interaction solutions among solitons and other types of nonlinear waves which may be explicitly expressed

by the Jacobi elliptic functions and the corresponding elliptic integral are constructed. To leave it clear, we give

out four types of soliton+cnoidal periodic wave solution. More types of these soliton-cnoidal wave solutions need

our further study.
