Abstract

The system under study is a reaction-diﬀusion equation in a horizontal strip, coupled
to a diﬀusion equation on its upper boundary via an exchange condition of the Robin
type. This class of models was introduced by H. Berestycki, L. Rossi and the second
author in order to model biological invasions directed by lines of fast diﬀusion. They
proved, in particular, that the speed of invasion was enhanced by a fast diﬀusion on the
line, the spreading velocity being asymptotically proportional to the square root of the
fast diﬀusion coeﬃcient. These results could be reduced, in the logistic case, to explicit
algebraic computations. The goal of this paper is to prove that the same phenomenon
holds, with a diﬀerent type of nonlinearity, which precludes explicit computations. We
discover a new transition phenomenon, that we explain in detail.

Introduction, statement of the problem

1.1 Model and question
Let ΩL be the strip {(x, y) ∈ R × (−L, 0)}. The goal of this paper is to study the large
time asymptotics of the following system:

ut − Duxx + µu − v(t, x, 0) = 0

(t > 0, x ∈ R)

vt − d∆v = f (v)

(t > 0, (x, y) ∈ ΩL)

dvy(t, x, 0) + v(t, x, 0) = µu(t, x)

(t > 0, x ∈ R)

vy(t, x,−L) = 0

(t > 0, x ∈ R)

(1)

The unknowns are the functions (u(t, x), v(t, x, y)), respectively deﬁned on R+ × R and
R+ × ΩL. The positive numbers µ, d, D are given. The function f (v) is smooth, and there
is θ > 0 such that f ≡ 0 on [0, θ] and f (1) = 0. Moreover f > 0 on (θ, 1) and f0(1) < 0.
Such a nonlinear term will sometimes be referred to as ignition type nonlinearity, in reference
to the mathematical literature on ﬂame propagation models. Of particular interest to us will
be the large time asymptotics of (1), combined with the limit D → +∞.

1.2 Motivation
System (1) was proposed for the ﬁrst time by Berestycki, Rossi and the second author in [5],
as a model for biological invasions in oriented habitats. It was indeed observed in several
instances that transportation networks tend to enhance the speed of invasion. Let us mention
two biological instances: the pine processionary moves northwards faster than anticipated,
and it is believed that the road network has a responsibility in the phenomenon, see for
example [21]. The yellow-legged hornet has invaded the whole South West of France, as
is reported in the maps provided in [13]:
it ﬁrst followed the main rivers, and from then
colonised the inland areas.
In [5], ΩL is replaced by the whole upper half-plane, and the nonlinearity f is a Fisher-
KPP type nonlinearity (f (0) = f (1) = 0, f > 0 concave between 0 and 1). The line {y = 0}
is named ’the road’, and the upper half-plane is named ’the ﬁeld’. This terminology will be
freely used here. We showed the dramatic eﬀect of the road on the overall propagation: there
is c∗(D) > 0 such that, for all c < c∗(D) we have

v(t, x, y) = 1, locally uniformly in y ∈ R,

t→+∞ inf

|x|≤ct

u(t, x) = 1/µ,

and, for all c > c∗(D) we have

v(t, x, y) = 0, uniformly in y ∈ R.

D, as D → +∞. This is in sharp con-
Moreover, there is c∞ > 0 such that c∗(D) ∼ c∞
trast with the classical propagation results for reaction-diﬀusion equations, such as Aronson-
Weinberger [1]. One could question whether it is an eﬀect of the Fisher-KPP nonlinearity,
or if it holds for more general terms f.
In [11], the ﬁrst author gives a ﬁrst hint of the
robustness of this phenomenon, by constructing travelling waves (φ(x + ct), ψ(x + ct, y)) to
√
(1) whose speed c satisﬁes indeed c(D) ∼ c∞
D, where c∞ > 0 is characterised in terms
√
of a limiting problem obtained by rescaling x by
D and sending D to inﬁnity. In order to
conﬁrm the phenomenon for (1) with the ignition type nonlinearity, one should understand
whether, and how, those travelling waves attract the solutions of (1). Instead of presenting
the results now, we will show some numerical simulations, which reveal a phenomenon that
we had not expected.

1.3 Some numerical simulations
These simulations were produced using FreeFem++. We used P2 ﬁnite elements on a mesh
of 400 × 50 points. The time scheme used is a two-step (to handle the coupling) explicit
Euler, which seems quite suﬃcient in terms of accuracy and speed for our context. Neumann
boundary conditions are imposed on the sides of a domain of size A× L with A (cid:29) L. Finally,
we represented u as a function over the whole domain so that it is visible. The following
parameters were used :

Figure 3: t = 300∆t and t = 750∆t

Figure 4: t = 1000∆t and t = 1300∆t

The scenario that we would expect is thus the following: due to the large diﬀusivity D,
u is quickly spread on all R and decays rapidly. Meanwhile, v grows slowly and transmits
mass to u. At some point, u has recovered enough mass and starts to lead the propagation.
The acceleration of the propagation is then transmitted downwards from the road to the
bottom of the ﬁeld, reaching the regime dictated by the travelling wave. The remainder of
this paper is devoted to proving that this is indeed what happens.

2 Main results, discussion
Let us reformulate System (1) in the following way, we hope that it will help the reader
visualise the problem.

(3)
Some results will be stated for equation (2) and some for (3) and the proofs will juggle
between the two. We brieﬂy mention existence and uniqueness of a solution and refer to [5] for
the proof (where the strip is replaced by a half-plane but the argument still holds). We wish
to emphasise that uniqueness as well as many properties of this system are a consequence
of the monotone structure of (2) inherited from the maximum principle investigated in
[5, 10, 11]. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the large-time and large-diﬀusion
asymptotics of this solution.
Theorem 2.1. [Stated for equation (2)] Let (u0, v0) ∈ C(R) × C(ΩL), 0 ≤ µu0, v0 ≤ 1.
There exists a global solution in the classical sense to (2) with initial data (u0, v0). This solu-
tion is unique in the class of bounded classical solutions and satisﬁes 0 ≤ µu(t, x), v(t, x, y) ≤ 1
for all t ≥ 0, x ∈ R, y ∈ ΩL.

2.1 First results
The following theorems are natural consequences of the stability of front-like initial data
using an argument initiated by [15] and are not so unexpected. They will, nevertheless, be
useful for later purposes. A speciﬁcity of the present computations is that they should be
uniform in the large parameter D, this is why they are detailed.
Theorem 2.2. [Stated for equation (2)] Let (u0, v0) be a front-like initial datum for equation
(3), that is (u0, v0) ∈ Pα0 deﬁned in the next section. There exists an exponent ω > 0 that
depends on the initial data only through α0 and for all ε > 0 small enough there exist two
shifts ξ±

1 ∈ R such that
φ(x + cξ−
ψ(x + cξ−

1 + ct) − Cεe−ωt ≤ µu(t, x) ≤ µφ(x + cξ+1 + ct) + Cεe−ωt
1 + ct) − Cεe−ωt ≤ v(t, x, y) ≤ ψ(x + cξ+1 + ct) + Cεe−ωt

where C is a constant that depends only on f, d and L. Moreover, ω does not depend on
D > d.
Remark 2.1. The previous theorem does not give the convergence towards travelling waves,
but it gives a precise spreading velocity. In [19], this is the starting point of an iterative
argument showing a geometric decrease of the distance separating the two shifts with respect
to a ﬁxed time step. One could think of adapting the argument of [19] to (3), but this would
not be uniform in D > d. We prefer to focus on the really new features of the model.

We now turn to what happens for compactly supported initial data (see Theorem 4.1 for

a precised statement):
Theorem 2.3. [Stated for equation (2)] Let (u0, v0) be non-negative smooth compactly
√
D) such that if µu0, v0 > 1 − δ for
supported data. There exist δ > 0 and M = O(
x ∈ (−M, M ) then µu, v stays trapped (up to an exponentially decaying error) between two
shifts of a pair of travelling waves evolving in both directions.

2.2 Data with O(1) support and additional eﬀects
In this section we state the results that account for the above numerical simulations.
Theorem 2.4. [Stated for equation (2)] Let L be large enough (independently of D). There
exist M0, δ0 > 0 independent of D > d such that if the initial datum (u0, v0) satisﬁes

v0 > 1 − δ0 for x ∈ (−M0, M0)

then the following holds: let h(D) be any inﬁnitely increasing function as D → ∞; then after
a time tD = D1/2h(D) + O(1), the functions µu and v satisfy the assumptions of Theorem
2.3, in other words:

√

√

µu, v ≥ 1 − δ for x ∈ (−M

D, M

D).

As a consequence, starting from the time t = tD, propagation occurs as described in

Theorem 2.3.

One could argue that this happens in a much smaller time. The next theorem shows that,
even if the solution may not take all the time tD to fall into the assumptions of Theorem
2.3, it stills needs a lot of time. To what extent the upper bound in the preceding theorem,
and the lower bound in the next theorem, can be reconciled, is a very interesting question
that we leave for future work.
Theorem 2.5. [Stated for equation (2)] Let M0, δ0 > 0 be as in Theorem 2.4. For every
κ > 0, there exists Cκ > 0 such that, if

t ≤ CκD1/7−κ,

(4)

then (µu(t, .), v(t, ., .)) does not satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 2.3. More precisely we
have, uniformly in t satisfying (4):

D

= 0.

Finally, we investigate the situation of an initial datum supported only on the road. The
behaviour that we ﬁnd does not at all look like what we have just discovered for initial data
√
supported in the ﬁeld. If µu0 ≤ 1 has a support of size ≤ C
D there will be extinction. On
the other hand, we also provide conditions on µ for invasion to happen.
Theorem 2.6. [Stated for equation (3)] Let v0 ≡ 0 and µu0 = 1(−a,a) be initial data for (3)
and u, v the associated solutions. We have the following :

• There exists a0 > 0 independent of D such that if a < a0, µu and v decay to 0 uniformly

as t → +∞.

• If a = +∞ there are thresholds µ± independent of D such that for µ < µ− invasion

occurs and for µ > µ+, µu and v converge uniformly to 1/(µ(L + 1/µ)) ≤ θ.

• More generally, provided µ < µ−, there exists a1 > 0 independent of D such that if

a > a1, invasion occurs.

Remark 2.2. It is quite natural that µ too large leads to extinction: indeed, we normalised
u so that u ≤ 1/µ and moreover µ acts as a death rate in the equation on u. Meanwhile, v
sees the same initial boundary Robin condition ≡ 1 independently of µ.

2.3 Bibliographical study and discussion
The general issue of our work is that of speed-up versus quenching. The ﬁrst contribution
concerning the behaviour of compactly supported initial data in reaction-diﬀusion equation
of ignition (or bistable) type can be found in Kanel’ [17]. For the one dimensional equation

∂tv − ∂2

xxv = f (v)

the author shows the existence of two thresholds 0 < L0 ≤ L1 < +∞ such that if v0 = 1(−l,l)
with l < L0, v ends up below θ in ﬁnite time (and as a consequence, decays to 0 uniformly) :
we call this situation quenching. On the other hand, if l > L1 it is shown that v →t→+∞ 1
uniformly on compact sets. Zlatoš [23] showed L0 = L1, and more generally Du and Matano
[12] showed the existence of such thresholds for general one-parameter families of initial data.

For equations in cylinders and in the presence of a parallel shear ﬂow,

∂tv + Aα(y)∂xv − ∆v = f (v)

an important issue is to understand how a large amplitude ﬂow (i.e. A >> 1) will enhance
spreading. This has been studied in various papers starting from [3], where it is showed in
the case of a Fisher-KPP nonlinearity, a linear speed-up
A→+∞ kA.

c∗(A) ∼

In a more general setting, let us quote Constantin-Kiselev-Oberman-Ryzhik [6], who intro-
duce the notion of bulk burning rate. For ignition type nonlinearities, the same result holds
as proved by Hamel and Zlatoš [16] (see [11] for a comparison of their result with our situ-
ation). As for whether propagation or quenching holds, Constantin-Kiselev-Ryzhik [7] and
Kiselev-Zlatoš [18] show that the price to pay for propagation (hence, speed-up) also has a
linear scaling in A:

L0 ∼

A→+∞ k0A, L1 ∼

A→+∞ k1A,

provided that the ﬂow is not constant on too large intervals. In other words, one trades a
linear speed up of propagation for a linear growth in the critical size of initial data that leads
to quenching.

In the case of cellular ﬂows, the same phenomenon happens but with a scaling in A1/4
(up to a logarithmic factor): the speed-up property was proved by Novikov and Ryzhik [20]
for the KPP case and more recently by Zlatoš [24] for combustion type nonlinearities. On the
other hand, Fannjiang-Kiselev-Ryzhik [14] proved (for ﬂows with small enough cells) that if
L4 ln(L) < kA – where L represents the size of the square supporting the initial datum –
quenching happens. See also the numerical simulations of [22].

A diﬀerent type of mechanism is studied in Constantin-Roquejoﬀre-Ryzhik-Vladimora [8]
where the authors investigate a system coupling a reaction-diﬀusion equation and a Burgers
equation. They show diﬀerent quenching results with respect to a gravity parameter, one of
them being that quenching happens independently on l when the gravity is large enough.

In the light of this section, Theorem 2.4 may come up as a surprise since it shows a speed-
D) for free: D does not appear in the threshold size of the
up of the propagation (c = c∞
initial data v0. The trade-oﬀ is the presence of a "two-speed" mechanism: propagation ﬁrst
happens at a small speed that does not depend on D, but accelerates towards the full speed
c(D). On the other hand, if one tries to initiate the invasion only thanks to µu0 = 1(−l,l),
Theorem 2.6 shows that quenching happens if l < a0D1/2 (from the point of view of (2)).

2.4 Organisation of the paper
Section 3 is devoted to proving Theorem 2.2 in the more precise form Theorem 3.1, Section
4 provides the details for the proof of Theorem 2.3 by proving the detailed Theorem 4.1.
In section 5 we prove Theorem 2.4, and we prove Theorem 2.5 in Section 6. These two
sections will describe more precisely the mechanism that is at work. Finally, the last section
investigates the case of initial data supported on the road only.

3 Front-like initial data
Let us ﬁrst trap the initial data between functions that will evolve in sub and super-solutions
travelling at the right speed.

3.1 Trapping the initial data
We deal with bounded, uniformly continuous perturbations (ρ1, ρ2) such that there exist
C and α0 > 0 such that ρi(x) ≤ Ceα0x. Then we assume

0 ≤ µu0, v0 ≤ 1
(u0, v0) = (φ(x + ξ), ψ(x + ξ)) + (ρ1, ρ2)

(5)
(6)
for some (ρ1, ρ2) of the above form and some translation ξ ∈ R. Such initial data is said
to be in the class Pα0. In this subsection, we prove that such initial data can be trapped
between two translates of the travelling front, which is conceptually simple but necessary.
Due to the degeneracy of f (v) as v ≤ θ, we will have to use the following weight function.
Let L0 > 3 and

0 < α < min(α0, c).

Deﬁne Γ(x) to be a smooth non-decreasing function such that

1 if x > L0

Γ(x) =

eα(x+L0) if x < −L0 − 1

(7)

We also recall the exponential convergence towards 0 or 1 as x → ±∞ proved in [10], [11]:
there exist λ, ˜λ > 0 (bounded from below uniformly in D > d) and one can enlarge L0 > 0
so that

∀x < −L0/2
∀x > L0/2

≤ θ

2eλ(x+L0/2)
µφ, ψ
1 − µφ, 1 − ψ ≤ 1 − θ1
2

e− ˜λ(x−L0/2) ≤ 1 − θ1
2

≤ θ
2

(8)
where θ < θ1 < 1 is chosen so that −f0(s) ≥ −f0(1)/2 =: β > 0 when s > θ1. That
way, ahead of the front the system becomes linear and behind the front one controls the
monotonicity of f. We now assert the following:
Proposition 3.1. Assume (5),(6). Then for any ε > 0, there exist ξ−
enough such that

0 < 0 and ξ+0 > 0 large

µφ(x + ξ−
ψ(x + ξ−

0 ) ≤v0(x, y) ≤ ψ(x + ξ+0 , y) + εΓ(x + ξ+0 )

Proof. We only prove (9).
(10) is obtained simultaneously with the same arguments (y-
uniform limits, y-uniform exponential decay) by taking |ξ±
0 | large enough. We start with the
right inequality. Let ε > 0. Thanks to the uniform limit of φ as x → +∞, there exists Bε
independent of ξ+0 such that for x ≥ −ξ+0 + L0 + Bε,

µφ(x + ξ+0 ) + εΓ(x + ξ+0 ) ≥ 1 − ε + ε = 1 ≥ µu0(x).

On the other hand, when x ≤ −ξ+0 − L0 − 1, µu0(x) ≤ Ceα0x so here for the inequality to
0 +L0) ≥ Ceα0x. But since x + ξ+0 + L0 < 0 and 0 < α < α0, one
be true, one needs εeα(x+ξ+
just needs εeα0(x+ξ+
Now only the compact region x ∈ (−ξ+0 − L0 − 1,−ξ+0 + L0 + Bε) remains. Observe that
on this interval, µu0(x) goes uniformly to 0 as ξ+0 → ∞, whereas the right-hand side in (9)
has a ﬁxed positive inﬁmum, so that the desired order is obtained by enlarging ξ+0 .

0 +L0) ≥ Ceα0x, which is ensured as soon as ξ+0 > ln(C/ε) − L0.

For the existence of ξ−

0 : observe that on x ≥ −ξ−
µφ(x + ξ−

0 ) − εΓ(x + ξ−

0 ) ≤ 1 − ε ≤ µu0(x)

0 + L0 + 1

provided ξ−
rest of the proof, we need on x ≤ −ξ−

0 is negative enough, thanks to the uniform limit of u0 as x → +∞. Now for the

0 + L0 + 1
0 +L0) ≥ µφ(x + ξ−

εeα(x+ξ−

0 ) − (µφ(x) + ρ(x))

Because the exponential decay λ of φ and ψ satisﬁes λ > c ≥ α (see [11]) this is true on
x ≤ −ξ−

0 − L0 − Bε with Bε > 0 large enough independent of ξ−
0 ) ≥ µφ(x + ξ−
0 )

0 +L0) ≥ θeλ(x+ξ−

0 so that here

εeα(x+ξ−

Again, we cover the compact region left around the interface by enlarging −ξ−
0 .

3.2 Wave-like sub and supersolution
We adapt the original result of Fife-McLeod [15] using the simpliﬁed notations and gener-
alisation of Mellet-Nolen-Ryzhik-Roquejoﬀre [19]. The adaptation is computationally non
trivial, so let us ﬁrst explain the changes that we expect to happen. Our objective is to
build a supersolution u, v to (3) that is close to the front (φ, ψ) (in the frame moving at
speed c). In the homogeneous case and for generalized transitions fronts the authors of [19]
proposed ¯v = ψ(x + cξ(t)) + q(t)Γ(x + cξ(t)), where ψ is the front, ξ(t) is an increasing
shift starting from the initial one and converging to some ﬁnite limit, q(t) = εe−ωt and Γ
is deﬁned above: this is a necessary correction to take into account the initial perturbation
and the degeneracy of f on v ≤ θ. In our case, we will look for

(11)

(12)

¯v = ψ(x + cξ(t), y) + qv(t, y)Γ(x + cξ(t))

µ ¯u = µφ(x + cξ(t)) + qu(t)Γ(x + cξ(t))
µu = µφ(x − cξ(t)) − qu(t)Γ(x − cξ(t))

v = ψ(x − cξ(t), y) − qv(t, y)Γ(x − cξ(t))

and

with ξ starting from ξ±

0 . We will also use the fact that

∀M > 0,∃δM > 0 | ∂xφ, ∂xψ > δM when x ∈ (−M, M ).

8

Now we reduce α a bit more and set α = min(α0, c/5), just so that the quantities

αc − d/Dα2 ≥ αc − α2 > αc/4 − α2 > 0

cannot be zero. These quantities will play an important role in the following computations.
Observe that this condition on α means that the decay correction obtained through Γ is
limited: solutions starting from large perturbations (i.e. small α0) will be stabilized thanks
to a correction with an α0 decay also, but solutions from very small perturbations (i.e. very
large α0) will still need a c/5 correction in the decay at −∞ to be stabilized.

Since we still want an exponential decay of qv(t) we look for

qu(t) = εCe−ωt

qv(t, y) = εh(y)e−ωt

(13)

with separate variables. The boundary conditions yield h0(−L) = 0 and h0(0) + h(0) = C
so that we have a large choice for h. Nonetheless, it will become clear in the following
computations that a good candidate is

and G(x) =

. The role of these conditions will be clear in the computations.

Observe that since G0(0) > 0, the decay exponent ω is then linearly small as β or α0 or
µ is small, but it should be noticed that it does not depend on D ≥ d, and that it depends
on the initial data only through α0. We can now state the following:
Theorem 3.1. Assume (5),(6) and let u, v denote the associated solutions of (3). Let
ε0 = min(θ/4, (1 − θ1)/4, γ0) where

γ0 =

There exists a constant K0 that depends on the initial data only through α0 and such that if
ε ∈ (0, ε0), there exists ξ±

ψ(x + cξ−
1 ) ≤ v(t, x − ct, y) ≤ ψ(x + cξ+1 ) + qv(t, y)Γ(x + cξ+1 ) (17)
Proof. Inequations (16),(17) are set in the moving frame with variables (t, x + ct). As a
consequence, in the computations one has to replace ∂t by ∂t + c∂x. We now want to show
that ¯u, ¯v as deﬁned in (11) yields indeed a supersolution:

and that u, v as deﬁned in (12) yields a subsolution. Then (16),(17) will follow by an
application of the comparison principle, Prop. 3.1, and the monotonicity of ξ. Indeed, this
will show that in the original frame u, v stays trapped between the fronts shifted initially by

becomes of course exponentially small over time due to the e−ωt factor. Observe also that
˙ξ ≤ 1/4 and is exponentially decaying over time, so u, v will propagate at least and at most
with speed c + o(1).

We divide this computation in three zones concerning x + ξ(t). In the following, φ and ψ
will always mean φ(x + cξ(t)) and ψ(x + cξ(t), y), qu will always mean qu(t), qv will either
mean qv(t, 0) or qv(t, y) and Γ will always mean Γ(x + cξ(t)), all of these functions being
deﬁned as above in (7) and (13)-(14).

In this section, we go back in the ﬁxed original frame. Seeing the problem in the light of [15]
it is natural to test:

as a subsolution to (3), i.e. a pair of waves evolving in opposite directions. Of course, in
light of the previous section, for this to be a subsolution one needs a well chosen correction
in time and in space (in the degeneracy regime of f). Let us deﬁne the symmetrised fronts

˜φ(·) = φ(−·),

˜ψ(·) = ψ(−·).

In the sequel we will always use the following notations:

φ = φ(x + ct + ξ0 − cξ(t)),

˜φ = ˜φ(x − ct − ξ0 + cξ(t)),

and the same will hold for ψ, ˜ψ, Γ, ˜Γ. Here ξ0 will be a large initial shift and ξ(t) a time-
increasing shift with ξ(0) = 0 and cξ(+∞) ≤ 1, which will be realised as a smallness
condition on ε0. In this section we set

α = min(λ, ˜λ, c/5)

(20)

where λ and ˜λ are already deﬁned in (8) so that α yields the same inequations as above and
moreover α < λ, ˜λ. Γ is deﬁned as above, only with a little more margin. Precisely let us
set this time:

1 if x > L0 − 1

eα(x+L0) if x < −L0 + 1

Γ(x) =

(21)

We will set the following:

u = max(cid:16)0, φ + ˜φ − 1/µ − qu(t)/µ min(Γ, ˜Γ)

(cid:17) , v = max(cid:16)0, ψ + ˜ψ − 1 − qv(t, y) min(Γ, ˜Γ)

(cid:17) .

12

The proof will consist in adapting the previous computations. We shall see that (u, v) yields
a subsolution provided only a size condition on the initial shift ξ0 (independently of D > d).
This condition is important, because then for the initial data to lie above (u(0), v(0)) it
has to be large enough on a large enough interval. Moreover, we wish to insist on the fact
that to retrieve the original model (2) one has to change the variable x ← x/
D. As a
consequence, when stated for (2), our result assumes that u0, v0 are large enough on an
D. Theorem 2.3 will be proved as soon as we have proved the
interval with length of order
Theorem 4.1. 1. There exist ε0 > 0 small enough and two constants B, ξ0 > 0 large enough
such that for all 0 < ε < ε0, there exist a small δ > 0 and M > 0 such that if 0 ≤ µu0, v0 ≤ 1
satisfy µu0, v0 > 1 − δ on x ∈ (−M, M ), then
u = max(0, φ + ˜φ − 1/µ − qu/µ min(Γ, ˜Γ)),

v = max(0, ψ + ˜ψ − 1 − qv min(Γ, ˜Γ))

t→+∞(1) in both directions.

As a consequence, (3) propagates the initial data u0, v0 along the x-axis with speed at least
as c + o
2.Using the notations of Section 2 we have the following: let ˜u, ˜v denote the same functions
as in (11) with φ, ψ and Γ replaced by ˜φ, ˜ψ, ˜Γ. As a consequence, ˜u, ˜v will be a supersolution
for decreasing front-like initial data. Up to enlarging the initial shifts, we assert that

(min( ¯u, ˜u), min( ¯v, ˜v))

is a supersolution to (3) with initial data u0, v0 for all times. Again, this implies that

u ≤ min( ¯u, ˜u), v ≤ min( ¯v, ˜v)

and so that the level lines of u, v propagate at most as c + ˙ξ = c + o(1) in both directions
along the x-axis.
Remark 4.1. (i). As noticed above, observe that one needs to replace M ← M
D when
Theorem 4.1 is stated for the original system (2).
(ii). The size condition on u0, v0 is far from optimal and ensures only that u0 ≥ u(0), v0 ≥
v(0). It could be sharpened by replacing 1 − δ with θ and by waiting long enough for the
reaction to put u, v above 1 − δ.

Proof. The second part of Theorem 4.1 is easy because the minimum of two supersolutions
is a supersolution and any front like initial data can be translated above any compactly
supported initial data.
The ﬁrst part is more intricate. Observe that u(0), v(0) are zero except on a set of length
(−M, M ) (with M proportional to ξ0) and that on (−M, M ) they are less than some 1 − δ:
this directly gives the largeness condition asked so that u0 ≥ u(0), v0 ≥ v(0). We now detail
the computation of N (u, v) in the following subsections by splitting the computations in
three zones concerning x + ct + ξ0.
4.1 x + ct + cξ0 < −L0
In this zone, one has necessarily x + ct + ξ0 − ξ(t) < −L0 and also x − ct − ξ0 + ξ(t) < −L0
(by asking 2ξ0 ≥ 1). As a consequence, in this zone we have µφ, ψ, v ≤ θ/2 and µ ˜φ, ˜ψ ≥
(1 + θ1)/2. Also min(Γ, ˜Γ) ≡ Γ ≡ eα(x+ct+ξ0−ξ(t)+L0) will be denoted eα(··· ) from now on.

This quantity can be made negative provided ω ≤ 2αc (which is already the case): indeed,

that ξ0 is large enough (but depending on the initial data only through α0).

x + ct + ξ0 − cξ(t) ∈ (−L0 − 1, L0) and x − ct − ξ0 + cξ(t) < −L0. Since ω < 2αc, the

ξ0 + cξ(t) < −L0 + 1, so here min(Γ, ˜Γ) ≡ 1 and both ψ and ˜ψ are close to 1.

Initial data with O(1) compact support
We now go back to the original equation (2) and state the following.
Theorem 5.1. Let L be large enough (independently of D). There exist M0, δ0 > 0 indepen-
dent of D > d such that if the initial data of (2) satisﬁes

v0 > 1 − δ0 for x ∈ (−M0, M0)
then after a ﬁnite time tD = D1/2h(D) + O(1) one has µu and v satisfying the assumptions
√
of Theorem 4.1, i.e. µu, v ≥ 1 − δ for x ∈ (−M
D). As a consequence, starting
from the time t = tD, propagation occurs as described in Theorem 4.1.

D, M

√

We will divide the proof in several steps:

Step 1. Since D > d is ought to be large, u should be very small for small times. Thus we
ﬁrst investigate the equation for v in (2) where u is replaced by 0, and we not only expect
to use its solution as a subsolution but we really expect that it will reﬂect the dynamics of
the full solution for some time:

d∂yv + v = 0

∂tv − d∆v = f (v)

∂yv = 0

(22)
Step 2. Let p(y) be the largest y-dependent steady solution to (22).The travelling wave for
(22) connecting 0 and p(y) will serve to build a subsolution for (22) propagating just as in
Theorem 4.1 but here at speed cp = O(1). This will give a lower bound on the boundary
data v(x,−L) ≥ v(x,−L) ≥ ··· . This will be the purpose of Lemma 5.2.
Step 3. Using this lower bound, we then go back to (3): we show that even without the
reaction term, this lower bound suﬃces to have µu, v ≥ 1 − δ on (−M, M ) within a ﬁnite
time tD. As a consequence, this is the case also for the nonlinear problem. This will be
proved in a ﬁnal step. Observe that here we use f ≥ 0. If we were looking for instance at a
bistable nonlinearity this would still be true but we would need to add a positive zero-order
term in these computations.

We recall the following elementary fact, that we will freely use in the sequel.

Lemma 5.1. There exists L0 > 0 such that if L > L0, there exists a solution p(y) to

(23a)
(23b)
(23c)
with p > 0 concave decreasing and p(−L) = 1 − δ00 > 1 − δ. Moreover δ00 → 0 as L → +∞.

−dp00 = f (p)
p0(−L) = 0
dp0(0) + p(0) = 0



15

Let us now prove the following:

Lemma 5.2. Let v be a solution of (22). There exist δ0, M0 > 0 independent of D such that
if v0 > 1 − δ0 for x ∈ (−M0, M0), there holds

v(t, x,−L) ≥ (1 − δ00)ϕt(x) − Ce−bt

2 t and ϕt(x) = 0 for |x| ≥ cpt for some speed cp > 0 independent of D.

where C, b > 0 do not depend on D and (ϕt) is bounded in C3 such that ϕt(x) = 1 for
|x| ≤ cp
Proof. First, that there exists a travelling wave solution with speed cp > 0 independent of D
of (22) connecting 0 and p(y) has to be established: for this we refer to Berestycki-Nirenberg
[4] which gives the existence of an increasing (in x) travelling front ψ(x, y) with exponential
convergence towards 0 and p(y) as x → ±∞.

Now we notice that the subsolution argument in Theorem 4.1 can be used but in a simpler
fashion for the Robin homogeneous boundary value problem (22): one the one hand, the
structure of the problem is simpler than the one studied in Theorem 4.1 since here we deal
with a single equation, the original construction of [15] with qv = εe−ωt will suﬃce. On the
other hand, 1 is not a steady state for the problem so one has to replace 1 by p(y) in the
computations. Nonetheless, one can check that the above computations still hold with the
adequate subsolution

ψ + ˜ψ − p − qv min(Γ, ˜Γ)

As a consequence, just as in Theorem 4.1, provided v0 is above an initial shift of a pair of
waves – hence the existence of δ0 and M0 – its level lines will be pushed by below by the pair
of waves travelling as ±cpt ∓ O(1). This implies the desired bound.
End of the proof of Theorem 5.1. Let (uD, vD) be the solution of (3) starting from com-
pactly supported 0 ≤ µu0, v0 ≤ 1 and let v0 satisfy the rescaled assumptions of Theorem
5.1. First, let h(D) be any positive function such that h(D) grows to inﬁnity as D → ∞,
and set TD = D1/2h(D). We now show the following

(x,y)∈ΩL,M

lim inf
t→+∞ inf

{µuD(TD + t, x), vD(TD + t, x, y)} ≥ 1 − δ00 > 1 − δ

(24)
where ΩL,M = (−M, M ) × (−L, 0). First, it is an easy but tedious exercise to see that the
left hand-side of (24) can be characterised as the limit as n → +∞ of some µuDn(TDn +
tn, xn) or vDn(TDn + tn, xn, yn) where tn → +∞, Dn > d, (xn, yn) ∈ ΩL,M. We then
extract from (tn, Dn, xn, yn) a subsequence so that xn → x∞ and yn → y∞. Our objective
is to extract from (u, v) a subsequence converging to some limiting (u∞, v∞) to which the
maximum principle will apply and force the above limit to be ≥ 1− δ00. The diﬃculty comes
from the fact that (Dn) might be unbounded and so that standard parabolic estimates and
the usual maximum principle might fall at the limit. Two cases can appear:
Case 1. (Dn) is unbounded. Then we extract again so that Dn → +∞. Let

un(t, x) := uDn(tDn + tn + t, x∞ + x),

vn(t, x, y) := vDn(tDn + tn + t, x∞ + x, y).

Since f ≥ 0 and by Lemma 5.2 above, by the comparison principle we have (un, vn) ≥
(un, vn) the solution of

xxun = vn − µun

d∂yvn = µun − vn

Dn

∂tvn − d

yyvn = 0

vn = (1 − δ00)ϕTDn +tn(x∞ + x) − Ce−b(tn+t)

(25)

16

Since d/Dn → 0, the standard parabolic estimates applied on vn will fall concerning the x-
derivatives. We overcome this diﬃculty since equation (25) is linear and the boundary data
vn(t, x,−L) is bounded in C3: the maximum principle applied on x-derivatives of (un, vn)
up to order 3 gives that they are all bounded independently of n:

xxun|∞,|∂3
|∂2

xxxun|∞,|∂2

xxvn|∞,|∂3

xxxvn|∞ ≤ C1

Now concerning the y-derivatives, even though d/Dn → 0 the standard estimates hold:
indeed since vn ≤ 1, standard Lp parabolic estimates with p large enough applied on

un give that un is bounded in Cα,1+α by some C2. Now rescale by x ← x

un is bounded in C1+α/2,2+α. In the end one can extract from (un, vn) some subsequence
converging in C1,2

loc to some (u∞, v∞) global in time (since tn → +∞) solving

∂tu∞ − ∂2

xxu∞ = v∞ − µu∞

d∂yv∞ = µu∞ − v∞
∂tv∞ − d∂2
yyv∞ = 0

Indeed, v∞(t, x,−L) ≡ 1 − δ00 since

v∞ = (1 − δ00)

(26)

1 − δ00 ≥ vn(t, x,−L) ≥ 1 − δ00 − Ce−b(tDn +tn+t)
2 h(Dn)) by Lemma 5.2 above and by use of TDn.

Since (u∞, v∞) are global in time, there is no initial data anymore and the maximum

for x ∈ (− cp

2 h(Dn), cp
principle applies to give

µu∞, v∞ ≡ 1 − δ00.

Indeed, no value diﬀerent than 1 − δ00 can be reached, because then (u, v) would have an
inﬁmum smaller or a supremum larger than 1 − δ00. By translating over time (which is
possible since the solution is global) this inﬁmum or supremum would become a minimum or
maximum, that cannot be reached by u because of the strong parabolic maximum principle,
and neither by v by the strong parabolic maximum principle and Hopf’s lemma applied on
the suitable y-slice.
Case 2. (Dn) is bounded. Then one extracts so that Dn → D∞ > d and the above proof is
much simpler since standard regularity and maximum principle apply. Moreover TD is not
necessary.
In both cases, the lim inf above is ≥ u∞(0, 0) = 1 − δ00 or ≥ v∞(0, 0, y∞) = 1 − δ00, thus
(24) holds. Theorem 5.1 follows easily: indeed, there exists t1 independent of D such that
after tD = TD + t1, µu, v > 1 − δ on (−M, M ).

Observe that Tε,α exists by continuity. We now work by contradiction to show that if
Tα,ε = (1/ε)δ, then |w| stays of order less than εα0 with α0 > α. During the rest of the
proof, this will be abbreviated with "(cid:28) εα".
The scheme is as follows. First, we derive an L1 estimate on w1 by Duhamel’s formula.
This, inserted in estimate (50) yields the desired estimate on u and then on w. We then go
back to w1 to obtain the desired estimate, by a more intricate supersolution argument.

6.1 L1 bound on w1
By deﬁnition, up to time Tε,α one has |w| ≤ εα. By Duhamel’s formula and the maximum
principle for equation (29), this yields

|w1| ≤ εα

where ∂N R
yy denotes ∂yy endowed with the Neuman-Robin boundary condition of (29). Since
· ≤ v0 + εα, using the above results and rescaling them, one knows that v0 ≤ θ for x ≤
(a + cpt)ε for some constant a > 0. As a consequence,

|f0(·)| ≤ Lipf × 1((−a−cps)ε,(a+cps)ε).

Also, by the maximum principle, there exist C(d) > 0 and λ1(d) > 0 such that
yy 1((−a−cps)ε,(a+cps)ε) ≤ Ce−λ1(t−s)1((−a−cps)ε,(a+cps)ε).

ed(t−s)∂N R

Using both estimates in (31), the maximum principle yields

|w1| ≤ CLipf εα

edε2(t−s)∂xxe−λ1(t−s)1((−a−cps)ε,(a+cps)ε)ds.

(32)

Since edε2(t−s)∂xx preserves the L1 norm, this gives the estimate, for some constants C1, C2
that do not depend on ε:

e−λ1(t−s)2(cps + a)εds = εα+1(C1 + C2t) (cid:28) εα,

rescaling of the supersolution to the non-linear equation in the previous section, and using
the same notations as in it, we look for a supersolution with the form

for some ξ(t) increasing in time and initial shift xs0. First of all, we need to ensure ordering

h(0) ≥ (f0(·)w)(s), which is obtained provided
h(0) ≥ Lipf εα+ν1((−a−cps)ε,(a+cps)ε)

As in Section 3.2, we analyse the sign of this quantity in three separate zones. Observe
that due to the rescaling between (2) and (3), decay exponents Θ, Θ0 (resp. the α and α0
from Sec. 3.2) and λ, ˜λ scale here as 1/ε as well as the lower bounds on the derivatives
δL. Remember also that we are looking only at times t ≤ ε−δ, so we only need to ﬁnd a
supersolution up to this time. We also reinitialize the constants Ci and Ki which will be
positive constants independent of ε.

x + cpεt + xs0 < −L0

6.3.1
As before, in this zone we have ψ ≤ θ/2,
1 − ˜ψ, ∂x ˜ψ ≤ C1e− ˜λ(x−cpεt−xs0+L0) and min(Γ, ˜Γ) ≡ Γ = e
consequence and since Θ < ˜λ, one has

Moreover by using Θ < ˜λ, ω < 2Θcpε and the previous expression of e−2Θxs0 one obtains

−ξf0(·)∂x ˜ψ,−ξf0( ˜ψ)∂x ˜ψ ≥ −εα+νC4e−ωt

so that we ask also for

˙ξ ≥ K2εα+ν+1e−ωt,

which is implied by (42) by taking K1 large enough. The last term to counterbalance is

ξ∂xψ[f0(ψ) − f0(·)] ≥ −ξ∂xψLip(f ) (|v0 − ψ| + εα)
by the triangle inequality and the deﬁnition of ·. But we also know that

|ψ − v0| ≤ |ψ − (ψ + ˜ψ − 1)| + |(ψ + ˜ψ − 1) − v0| ≤ |1 − ˜ψ| + C5e−ω0t

by Section 5 for some C5, ω0 > 0 independent of ε. Now just as above, one can use the
exponential decay of 1 − ˜ψ in the current zone to prove that there exists C6 > 0 such that
|1 − ˜ψ| ≤ C6e−ωt. In the end

ξ∂xψ[f0(ψ) − f0(·)] ≥ −Lip(f )ξ∂xψ
We can reduce ω and change the constants so that

and we counterbalance this term by asking (remember the additional power of ε factor due
to the scaling of δ2L0)

(43)
We now have to ﬁnd a suitable increasing function t 7→ ξ(t) satisfying (42), (43) and that
should not increase too much so that w1(ε−δ) (cid:28) εα. Since the order between the right-hand
sides in (43) changes at some point in time, we deﬁne ξ in two parts as a continuous but only
piecewise C1 function. This is not a problem since one can apply the maximum principle a
second time starting from the junction. We propose

tinuous: B(ε) = e
since we just integrated the stronger diﬀerential equation between the two on the associated
time-intervals. Observe that (42) is indeed satisﬁed provided K2, K3 > K1 and ε is small.
Now with this choice of ξ – since ξ (cid:28) εα+ν up to time ε−δ – observe that the remaining
condition on xs0 (41) is void since xs0 > 0 and it reduces to the initial one (39). Finally, the
only condition on ω is (40).
x + cpεt + xs0 ≥ L0

6.3.3
As before, we deal with this last zone by using symmetry and by repeating the arguments
above: no stronger condition appears and the computations above hold (by eventually chang-
ing the constants).

7.1 a is small
Theorem 7.1. There exists a0 > 0 such that for a < a0, the solution of (3) starting from
(1(−a,a), 0) decays to 0 uniformly.

The proof relies on a suitable reformulation of equation (2) and a crude bound on f.

Observe that, if we replace v by its even extension on R × [−L, L], we have

if a < a0 for some a0. Then the maximum principle yields that from this time µu, v will
always stay below the constant solution 2θ/3 of (2). And so, µu and v will tend to 0.
7.2 Best case scenario: a = +∞
In this subsection we take µu0 ≡ 1. Since both the initial data and equation (3) enjoy here a
translation invariance in the x direction, u and v do not depend on x. We prove the following
Theorem 7.2. There exist µ± > 0 such that:

24

a) If µ > µ+, µu and v converge uniformly to 1/(µ(L + 1/µ)) as t → +∞.
b) If µ < µ−, µu and v converge uniformly to 1 as t → +∞.
Proof of point a). Using Lemma 7.1 one gets, for t ≤ 1: v(t, x, y) ≤ C
t (for some constant
C diﬀerent than the C in the afore mentioned Lemma). Using this in the equation for u,
one gets

one has µu, v ≤ θ. By the comparison principle, this will hold for all t > tµ and v never
gets above θ anywhere. As a consequence, µu(t), v(t, y) converge to a common limit l ≤ θ
satisfying (L + 1/µ)l = 1/µ (conservation of mass).
Proof of point b). The idea of the proof is simple: we investigate whether the sole diﬀusion
is able to transfer enough mass from u to v so that in ﬁnite time v is above θ on a large
enough interval (−L0, 0). The quantity L0 is linked to Kanel’ and Aronson-Weinberger
[17, 1]. Using v ≥ 0 and the strong parabolic maximum principle one gets µu ≥ e−µt. So
that setting θ0 = (1 + θ)/2 and tM = 1

Chose L0 large enough in the beginning so that an initial condition µu(tM ), v(tM, y) ≥
(1 + 3θ)/4, for all y ∈ (−L0, 0), leads to invasion: µu, v → 1 as t → ∞. The existence of
such an L0 follows from Kanel’, Aronson-Weinberger [17, 1] on R. In our context, it is in
fact simpler since total mass is conﬁned in (−L, 0) and a single point whereas in [17, 1] it
can be spread on all R.
7.3 Large a < +∞
We use the best case scenario described above to prove the existence of large but ﬁnite a
that will lead to invasion. Our proof relies on the fact that 1(−a,a) and 1(−∞,∞) are close in
L∞ weighted by some ρ(x) with tails e−|x| and that such a weight preserves the semi-linear
parabolic and monotone structure of the system (3). In particular, the "weighted equation"
will have a locally (in time) Lipschitz continuous ﬂow. Going back to the original solutions,
this Lipschitz continuity becomes a uniform continuity on every compact subset.
Lemma 7.3. There exists a smooth weight ρ(x) > 0 such that ρ(x) = e−|x| for |x| > 1

and such that the following holds. Denote k(f, g)kX = max(cid:16)kρfkL∞(R),kρgkL∞(ΩL)

(cid:17) . For

every T, M > 0, there is CT ,M > 0 independent of D such that

for every (u, v) and ( ˜u, ˜v) solutions of (3) starting from respectively (u0, v0) and ( ˜u0, ˜v0).
Remark 7.1. Observe that the above Lemma could be stated for any ρα(x) = e−α|x| (with
√
α > 0) by changing the constants: this is due to the scaling invariance (t, x, y) → (Λt,
Λx,
of equation (3) ; indeed, ρα becomes ρ1 in the rescaling by Λ = α2.

√

Λy)

End of the proof of Theorem 2.6. Once Lemma 7.3 is proved, the end of Theorem 2.6 follows
easily. Indeed, let u0 = 1(−a,a) and v0 = 0 as well as ˜u0 = 1(−∞,+∞) and ˜v0 = 0. Observe
that if a > 1, we have k(u0 − ˜u0, v0 − ˜v0)kX = e−a. Moreover, since µ < µ−, by Theorem
7.2 above, there exists T > 0 such that µ ˜u(T, x), ˜v(T, x, y) ≥ 1 − δ/2, with δ as in Theorem
4.1. By choosing a > max{1,− ln(δ/(2CT ,M ))} =: a1 (which does not depend on D), and
applying Lemma 7.3 on [0, T ] × [−M, M ] (with M as in Theorem 4.1), one has

|µu(T, x) − µ ˜u(T, x)| + |v(T, x, y) − ˜v(T, x, y)| ≤ δ/2 for all − M < x < M.

As a consequence, µu(T, x), v(T, x, y) ≥ 1 − δ for all −M < x < M.

Proof of Lemma 7.3. The proof relies only on the parabolic maximum principle applied to a
weighted equation. Let ρ(x) deﬁne a positive C2 function such that ρ(x) = e−|x| for |x| ≥ 1.

By choice of C, the 0-order terms in parentheses in equation (49) are positive, thus equation
(49) enjoys the maximum principle and the maximum and minimum values of (µU, V) are
reached at initial time. Indeed, as usual if the maximum is reached by V, then either it is
reached at initial time or it has to be reached on y = 0 but there Hopf’s lemma gives the
contradiction µU > V. It U reaches it, a contradiction is obtained at this point by seeing
that the left-hand side in the equation satisﬁed by U is non-negative: thus V > µU. In the
end we have for all 0 ≤ t < T:

max(|(u− ˜u)(t)|L∞(R),|(v− ˜v)(t)|L∞(ΩL)) ≤ eCT max(cid:16)|(u − ˜u)(0)|L∞(R),|(v − ˜v)(0)|L∞(ΩL)

(cid:17) ,

i.e. for all t < T, x ∈ R, y ∈ [−L, 0]:

ρ(x) (|u − ˜u|(t, x) + |v − ˜v|(t, x, y)) ≤ 2eCTk(u0 − ˜u0, v0 − ˜v0)kX

and Lemma 7.3 follows by taking CT ,M = 2eCT supx∈(−M,M )
M is large. Observe that CT ,M depends only on T, M and Lipf.

Appendix: the heat kernel
We compute here the large time asymptotics of the solution (u(t, x), v(t, x, y)) to

ut − uxx + µu − v(t, x, 0) = 0
vt − ε2vxx − vyy = 0

vy(t, x, 0) = µu(t, x) − v(t, x, 0)

(t > 0, x ∈ R)
(t > 0, x ∈ R, y ∈ (−L, 0))
(t > 0, x ∈ R)

(50)

with initial datum

(u(0, x), v(0, x, y)) = (u0(x), 0).

(51)
Notice that we have, without loss of generality, set d = 1. We limit ourselves to u(t, x),
as this is the quantity that will be useful to us. the method that we use is quite standard,
a computationally much more involved case being treated in [9] where the diﬀusion on the
road is represented by the fractional Laplacian.
Proposition A.1. Set a =
function δ(t) tending to 0 as t → +∞ such that we have, for t ≥ 1

. There are two constants C > 0 and ω > 0, and a

Proof. Let ( ˆu(t, ξ), ˆv(t, ξ, y)) be the Fourier transform in x of (u, v); we have

ˆut + ξ2 ˆu + µ ˆu − ˆv(t, x, 0) = 0
ˆvt − ε2 ˆv − ˆvyy = 0

(t > 0, ξ ∈ R)
(t > 0, ξ ∈ R, y ∈ (−L, 0))
(t > 0, ξ ∈ R)

(52)

ˆvy(t, ξ, 0) = µu(t, ξ) − v(t, ξ, 0)
with initial datum ( ˆu(0, ξ), ˆv(0, ξ, y)) = ( ˆu0(x), 0).
1. The case of large |ξ|. Let A(ξ) be the operator acting on C((−L, 0)) with domain the
set of all functions w(y) ∈ C2((−L, 0)) such that wy(−L) = wy(0) + w(0) = 0, and deﬁned
by A(ξ)w = −wyy + ε2ξ2w. Its ﬁrst eigenvalue is (as is given by a simple computation)
λ0 + ε2ξ2, with λ0 being the ﬁrst positive root of

an eigenfunction is cos(
Thus the solution w(t, ξ, y) of
wt − wyy + ε2ξ2w = 0, (t > 0,−L < y < 0), wy(t, ξ,−L) = wy(t, ξ, 0) + w(t, ξ, 0) = 0,
with initial datum w0(ξ, y) satisﬁes

|w(t, ξ, y)| ≤ δ−1

0 kw0(ξ, .)kL∞((−L,0)).

(53)

Now, multiply the equation for ˆu by ˆu/| ˆu|, this yields

∂t| ˆu| + (ξ2 + µ)| ˆu| ≤ µ|ˆv(t, ξ, 0)|.

From (53) and the Duhamel formula we obtain

∂t| ˆu| + (ξ2 + µ)| ˆu| ≤ µδ−1

Choose any ω0 ∈ (0, λ0), we will prove the inequality

| ˆu(t, ξ)| ≤ C| ˆu0(ξ)|e−ω0t

(54)
for a universal C, a suitably chosen A > 0 and |ξ| ≥ 10A1/4. Set U (t, ξ) = eω0t(| ˆu(t, ξ)| −
| ˆu0(ξ)|e−(ξ2+µ)t), we have

(55)

The function t 7→ U (t, ξ) is either decreasing or has positive maxima.
In the ﬁrst case,
because U (0, ξ) = 0 we have | ˆu(t, ξ)| ≤ | ˆu0(ξ)|e−(ξ2+µ)t, so (54) is proved. Let us assume
the contrary, and let t0 such that U (t, ξ) ≤ U (t0, ξ) for all t ≤ t0. In such a case we have,
from (55):

Z t

(ξ2 + µ − µδ−1

)U (t0, ξ) ≤ µ0δ−1| ˆu0(ξ)|e−(λ0−ω0)t0

ξ2 − (λ0 − ω0)

.

So, (54) is once again proved.
2. The case of intermediate |ξ|. We consider the range ε0 ≤ |ξ| ≤ A, A being chosen
so that (54) holds. Let us this time consider the operator L(ξ), acting on C × C((−L, 0)),
its domain being all couples (u, v) in C × C2((−L, 0)) such that wy(−L) = 0 and wy(0) +
w(0) = µu, and its action being given by

L(ξ)(u, w) = (ξ2 + µ)u − w(0),−www + ε2ξ2w).

(56)
The family L(ξ) is a family if sectorial operators with uniformly bounded coeﬀcients. More-
over, by Krein-Rutman’s theorem, for |ξ| ∈ ε0, A), and ε ∈ (0, 1), L(ξ) has a bottom eigen-
value λ0(ξ). Possibly, it depends on ε, but with a common positive lower bound depending
on ε0 that we call ω0 a positive So, there is θ0 ∈ (0π/2) such that the path γ = ω0 + Reiθ0
encloses σ(L(ξ)), for all ξ in the range that we consider. We have

e−tL(ξ)( ˆu0, ˆv0) =

an expression that admits a bound of the form

ke−tL(ξ)( ˆu0(ξ), 0)kL∞((−L,0)) ≤ Ce−ω0t| ˆu0(ξ)|.

(58)
3. The case of small |ξ|. Fix ε0 > 0 small so that the following (ﬁnite set of) considerations
are true. Here we simply perform a Laplace transform of (52), we still call ˆu(λ, ξ) the
unknown in the new variables (λ, ξ) this leads (after some standard algebra) to the system

ˆu(λ, ξ) = ˆu0(ξ).

The factor before ˆu(λ, ξ) vanishes, for |ξ| ≤ ε0, at a unique λ(ξ)saisfying:

λ(ξ) ∼ (1 + µε2)ξ2

1 + µ

,

the next zeroes being further away, uniformly in ξ, by the principle of isolated zeroes. Then,
(57) remains valid and a standard inverse Laplace transform computation yields the existence
of a function δ(t) = ot→+∞(1) such that

The proposition is proved by taking the inverse Fourier transform of ˆu, and putting together
estimates (54), (58), (60) and (61).
