ABSTRACT
We present a new redshift survey, the 2dF Quasar Dark Energy Survey pilot (2QDESp),
which consists of ≈10000 quasars from ≈150 deg2 of the southern sky, based on VST-ATLAS
imaging and 2dF/AAOmega spectroscopy. Combining our optical photometry with the WISE
(W1,W2) bands we can select essentially contamination free quasar samples with 0.8<z<2.5
and g<20.5. At fainter magnitudes, optical UVX selection is still required to reach our g≈22.5
limit. Using both these techniques we observed quasar redshifts at sky densities up to 90
deg−2. By comparing 2QDESp with other surveys (SDSS, 2QZ and 2SLAQ) we ﬁnd that
quasar clustering is approximately luminosity independent, with results for all four surveys
consistent with a correlation scale of r0=6.1±0.1 h−1Mpc, despite their decade range in lumi-
nosity. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant redshift dependence of clustering, particularly when BOSS data
with r0=7.3±0.1 h−1Mpc are included at z≈2.4. All quasars remain consistent with having a
single host halo mass of ≈2±1×1012 h−1M(cid:12). This result implies that either quasars do not
radiate at a ﬁxed fraction of the Eddington luminosity or AGN black hole and dark matter
halo masses are weakly correlated. No signiﬁcant evidence is found to support fainter, X-ray
selected quasars at low redshift having larger halo masses as predicted by the ‘hot halo’ mode
AGN model of Fanidakis et al. (2013). Finally, although the combined quasar sample reaches
an eﬀective volume as large as that of the original SDSS LRG sample, we do not detect the
BAO feature in these data.

INTRODUCTION

Quasars are a very luminous subset of the active galactic nuclei
(AGN) population. Due to their high intrinsic luminosities they can
be exploited in a wide variety of cosmological and astrophysical
studies. Quasars possess an ultraviolet excess (UVX) of emission
with respect to stars. The UVX property has previously been ex-
ploited by large area surveys to preform quasar selection, such as
2QZ (Smith et al. 2005), 2SLAQ (Richards et al. 2005) and SDSS
(Richards et al. 2002). In addition to their UVX property, quasars

c(cid:13) 2016 The Authors

possess an excess of emission with respect to stars in the infra-
red. This method of selecting quasars is sometimes known as the
KX (K-band excess) technique and has also been used to photo-
metrically select quasars (see Maddox et al. 2012). The aim of the
2QDESp survey is to maximise the measured sky density of quasars
between 0.8<z<2.5 and hence minimise the correlation function er-
rors for both cosmological and quasar physics studies.

The 2QZ (Croom et al. 2005, hereafter C05), 2SLAQ (da
ˆAngela et al. 2008, hereafter dA08) and SDSS (Ross et al. 2009,
hereafter R09) surveys all measured the quasar correlation function
in approximately the same redshift interval (0.8<z<2.5). As each
of the surveys had diﬀerent magnitude limits but similar redshift
distributions we can compare these directly to one another to mea-

sure the luminosity dependence of quasar clustering. Shanks et al.
(2011, hereafter S11) discuss the implications of these three sur-
veys measuring a consistent value of r0, the clustering scale. Of par-
ticular interest to galaxy formation models is the apparent indepen-
dence (S11; dA08, and Shen et al. 2009) of quasar clustering with
luminosity. S11 examines the results from optical clustering mea-
surements (C05; dA08; R09) and attempts to reconcile these results
in context of existing models and ﬁnds no evidence for strong lumi-
nosity dependence of quasar clustering. This is surprising given the
measured relation between optical luminosity and black hole mass,
MBH, (Peterson et al. 2004) and black hole mass and dark matter
halo mass, MHalo, (Ferrarese 2002; Fine et al. 2006).

However, Fanidakis et al. (2013) predict that less luminous
quasars inhabit higher mass halos and reported that X-ray selected
quasars inhabit higher mass halos (∼1013M(cid:12)) than found in optical
studies (∼1012M(cid:12)). If optically and X-ray selected quasars sample
distinct populations there may be no contradiction to the conclu-
sions of S11. We aim to measure ∼80 quasars deg−2, comparable
to the sky density quasars in deep X-ray surveys (Allevato et al.
2011). At these space densities the signiﬁcant overlap between X-
ray and optical quasar samples should result in larger correlation
lengths if X-ray selected quasars inhabit higher mass halos.

Here we describe the ﬁrst quasar survey (2QDESp) using VLT
survey telescope (VST)-ATLAS (Shanks et al. 2015) optical pho-
tometry with follow-up spectroscopic observations made using 17
nights of AAT time using 2dF and the AAOmega spectrograph.
Combining 2QDESp with several previous quasar surveys we mea-
sure the luminosity dependence of quasar clustering for the com-
bined sample. In Section 2 we describe the imaging data and quasar
selection techniques. In Section 5 we describe our spectroscopic
follow-up of targets and the resulting quasar catalogue. In Section
6 we discuss the methods used to measure quasar clustering and
the results from the 2QDESp sample before incorporating the other
surveys into our analysis. From this combined sample we make
measurements of the luminosity and redshift dependence of quasar
clustering in Sections 6.3 and 6.4. We discuss our results and their
implications in Section 7. We assume H0 = 100 h km s−1 Mpc−1
and a ﬂat cosmology from Planck Collaboration et al. (2014) with
ΩM = 0.307. ugriz magnitudes are quoted in the AB magnitude
system unless stated otherwise, WISE magnitudes are left in their
native Vega system.

IMAGING
Imaging

2.1.1 VST-ATLAS

The VLT Survey Telescope (VST) is a 2.6 m wide-ﬁeld survey tele-
scope with a 1◦ × 1◦ ﬁeld of view and hosts the OmegaCAM instru-
ment. OmegaCAM (Kuijken et al. 2004) is an arrangement of 32
CCDs with 2k × 4k pixels, resulting in 16k × 16k image with a
pixel scale of 0.21(cid:48)(cid:48) . The VST-ATLAS is an ongoing photomet-
ric survey that will image ≈4700 deg2 of the southern extragalac-
tic sky with coverage in ugriz bands. The survey takes two sub-
exposures (exposure time varies across ﬁlters) per 1 degree ﬁeld
with a 25 × 85 arcsecond dither in X and Y to ensure coverage
across interchip gaps. The sub-exposures are then processed and
stacked by the Cambridge Astronomy Survey Unit (CASU). The
CASU pipeline outputs catalogues that are cut at approximately
5σ and provides ﬁxed aperture ﬂuxes and morphological classiﬁca-
tions of detected objects. The u-band catalogue comprises ‘forced

photometry’ at the position of g-band detections; no other band is
forced. The processing pipeline and resulting data products are de-
scribed in detail by Shanks et al. (2015). Bandmerged catalogues
were produced using TOPCAT and STILTS software (Taylor 2005,
2006). Unless otherwise stated, for stellar photometry we use a 1(cid:48)(cid:48)
radius aperture (aper3 in the CASU nomenclature). ATLAS pho-
tometry is calibrated using nightly observations of standard stars.
The calibration between nights can vary by ±0.05 mag (see Shanks
et al. 2015 for details). We performed a further calibration on the
ﬁelds we observed prior to target selection to ensure agreement be-
tween VST-ATLAS ﬁelds and the SDSS stellar locus, as described
in Section 4.0.6. With the VST-ATLAS survey under halfway com-
plete during our spectroscopy, the selection of 2dF pointing posi-
tions was governed by the progress of ATLAS. The ﬁelds are not
generally distributed over a spatially contiguous region, although
their seeing and magnitude limits are representative of the survey
as a whole. The morphological star-galaxy classiﬁcation we use is
that supplied as default in the CASU catalogues. This classiﬁcation
is discussed in detail (by Gonz´alez-Solares et al. 2008). We test the
morphological completeness for diﬀerent colour-colour selections
in Section 4.0.3.

2.1.2 WISE

The NASA satellite Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)
(Wright et al. 2010), mapped the entire night sky in four pass-
bands between 3.4 − 22µm. The survey depth varies over the sky
but approximate 5σ limits for point sources are W1 = 16.83 and
W2 = 15.60 mag. in the Vega system. The W1 and W2 bands have
point spread functions (PSFs) of 6.1(cid:48)(cid:48) and 6.4(cid:48)(cid:48) respectively com-
pared with ≈1(cid:48)(cid:48) in the VST-ATLAS bands. A comparison1 between
WISE catalogue positions and the USNO CCD Astrograph Cata-
log (UCAC3) catalogue shows that even at the faintest limits of W1
there is < 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) rms oﬀset between the two catalogues. We matched
ATLAS optical photometry to the publicly available WISE All-Sky
Source Catalogue using a 1(cid:48)(cid:48) matching radius. Given the size of the
WISE PSF we examine the possibility of WISE-ATLAS mismatch-
ing. For sky density of WISE sources at |b| > 30◦ we calculate that 1
in 25 quasars identiﬁed in WISE will have a blended WISE source
within 3(cid:48)(cid:48). Compared to this value, the contribution from quasar-
quasar pairs will be smaller. Given the other advantages of using
WISE selection, we view this eﬀect as essentially negligible.

3 OTHER QUASAR REDSHIFT SURVEYS

Here we introduce three additional quasar surveys that were used to
measure the clustering of optically selected quasars. To aid compar-
ison between these surveys and our own we summarise the method
of quasar selection for each survey, the measured space density,
area and size. In Section 6 we remeasure the correlation function for
these surveys, verifying our measurement against previously pub-
lished values (see Table 3). We then combine these survey with the
2QDESp sample to better constrain the autocorrelation function.

3.1 2QZ

The 2QZ survey (Croom et al. 2004) covers approximately 750
deg2 of the sky in two contiguous areas of equal size. The quasar

Figure 1. In the left panel we show the ugr colour space of the ﬁeld centred at 23h16m − 26d01m. We show all objects identiﬁed in the g-band as point-sources
(between 16 ≤ g ≤ 20.5) as grey dots. We show the SDSS Stripe 82 stellar locus (dotted blue line) and our ugr colour cuts (purple dashed lines) from Section
4.0.4. Spectroscopically conﬁrmed quasars within our target redshift range (0.8<z<2.5) are shown as green triangles and conﬁrmed stars are shown as black

sample consists of over 22500 spectroscopically conﬁrmed sources
at redshifts less than 3.5 and apparent magnitudes 18.25<bJ<20.85.
Quasars are selected based on their broadband optical colours from
automated plate measurement (APM) scans from United Kingdom
Schmidt Telescope (UKST) photographic plates. Colour selection
is performed using u − bJ vs. bJ − r. The measured quasar density
is ≈30 quasars deg−2.

3.2 SDSS DR5

The SDSS DR5 uniform sample (Schneider et al. 2007) con-
tains 30 000 spectroscopically conﬁrmed quasars between redshifts
0.3≤z≤2.2 and an apparent magnitude limit of iS DS S ≤ 19.1 over
≈4000 deg2. This sample was selected using single epoch photom-
etry from the SDSS using the algorithm given in Richards et al.
(2002). The sample is described in detail by R09 and has a mea-
sured quasar density of ≈8 quasars deg−2.

3.3

2SLAQ

The 2SLAQ survey (Croom et al. 2009) overlaps two subregions
within the 2QZ survey area, with an average quasar density ≈45
quasars deg−2 and redshifts of z (cid:46) 3. The 2SLAQ survey is based on
SDSS photometry and measures redshifts for quasars of apparent
magnitudes 20.5<gS DS S <21.85. This sample was designed to be
used in conjunction with the observations from the 2QZ survey,
(see dA08).

4 2QDESP QUASAR SELECTIONS
4.0.1 Quasar density g ≤ 22.5
Previously, 2QZ measured a completeness corrected sky density of
30 quasars deg−2 at bJ<20.85. 2SLAQ reached a nominal density
of 45 deg−2 at 20.5<gSDSS<21.85. dA08 combined the 2QZ and
2SLAQ samples to produce a higher density sample of ≈80deg−2.
However, the high incompleteness of 2SLAQ meant this high den-
sity was only achieved after the application of completeness cor-
rections. In this survey we aim to measure 80−100 quasars deg−2 in
the redshift range 0.8<z<2.5 in ∼1 hour 2dF exposures; we demon-
strate the feasibility of our aims below.

4.0.2 Quasar Luminosity Function

The ﬁrst concern of the 2QDES pilot is whether or not the lumi-
nosity function of quasars predicted 80+ quasars deg−2 within our
targeted redshift (0.8<z<2.5) and magnitude (16<g<22.5) range.
A small number of quasar redshift surveys have explored this red-
shift range to fainter limits than 2SLAQ although always in rel-
atively small areas. Fine et al. (2012) made a survey based on
Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Survey imaging. As well as using
colour selection, Fine et al. (2012) also used variability from many
epochs of imaging to select their quasar candidates. To a magni-
tude limit of g = 22.5 their measured quasar density was 88±6
deg−2 (0.8<z<2.5).
In SDSS Stripe 82 Palanque-Delabrouille et al. (2013) covered
≈15 deg2 and measured a completeness corrected quasar density
of 99±4 quasars deg−2. This was to the same depth as 2QDESp
(g ≤ 22.5) and in a narrower redshift range (1 ≤ z ≤ 2.2). However,

B. Chehade et al.

both these authors relied on multi-epoch photometry reaching 50%
completeness for point sources at g = 24.6 (c.f. g∼23 for VST-
ATLAS).

Finally, spectroscopic follow-up of X-ray sources in the
XMM-COSMOS ﬁeld (Brusa et al. 2010) has measured a quasar
density of 110 quasars deg−2 within our redshift interval to a depth
of g<22.5 (i <∼ 22.2).
Thus from these comparisons to other surveys we can be con-
ﬁdent that there exist a suﬃciently high space density of quasars
within the g≤22.5 limit of the survey. However, these complete
samples are often selected from deeper imaging with the added
beneﬁt of selecting quasars from their variability.

4.0.3 Photometric incompleteness from VST-ATLAS

The second question we address is whether the VST-ATLAS cat-
alogues are of suﬃcient depth to select 80−100 quasars deg−2. As
an approximate test of our photometric completeness we rely on
the u and g-bands where quasars have the colour u−g<0.5. In the
g-band the limit g<22.5 which is ∼0.7 mag brighter than the me-
dian 5σ depth of VST-ATLAS as such we assume we are always
complete in this band. The 5σ limits are based on sky noise but
as the u-band is forced this limit may not provide a good estimate
of the image depth. We match to the deeper KIDS survey (de Jong
et al. 2013) in an area of VST-ATLAS with u5σ = 21.7 (90% of tiles
have fainter limits, see Shanks et al. 2015). We ﬁnd that the use of
forced photometry in the u results in 50% completeness (c.f. KIDS)
at u=22 which is 0.3 mag deeper than the 5σ limit. Applying the
limits g<22.5 and u<22 (with 0.8<z<2.5) to the Fine et al. (2012)
data we recover 80±6 quasars deg−2. Assuming median depth lim-
its (u= 21.99) gives 87±6 quasars deg−2.
The number counts of the Fine et al. suggest the sample is
complete to g≈21.9. This incompleteness at fainter magnitudes will
lower the estimated return of quasars in the VST-ATLAS data. We
note that the more complete data of Palanque-Delabrouille et al.
(2013) returns ∼10% more quasars than Fine et al. (2012).

We have taken a conservative approximation of our photome-
try and a conservative estimate of the true quasar density and found
the VST-ATLAS photometry is suﬃciently deep to return our min-
imum target density (80 quasars deg−2). By assuming more rep-
resentative photometry and comparing to a more compete quasar
sample we expect these estimated densities to increase. We ﬁnally
note that in the 2QDESp survey (see Sections 5.2 and Table A)
that 90% of 2dF pointings have a u5σ>21.85 i.e. the u imaging is
slightly better than found in VST-ATLAS as a whole.

4.0.4

ugri selection

The UVX property of quasars was successfully used by both 2QZ
and SDSS to select quasars in our target redshift range (0.8<z<2.5).
As our photometric bands are the same as those used by SDSS, we
can base our colour selection on work from the SDSS collabora-
tion. We used known 2QZ quasars within the ATLAS footprint to
determine the colour cuts suitable for use with VST-ATLAS aper-
ture photometry.

For reference, we show the location of our cuts in ugr colour
space in the left panel of Figure 1. Our selection criteria were as
follows;

• −1 ≤ (u − g) ≤ +0.8
• −1.25 ≤ (g − r) ≤ 1.25
• (r − i) ≥ 0.38 − (g − r)

We applied this colour selection in a 2dF ﬁeld with typical VST-
ATLAS depth and seeing and found ≈600 candidates deg−2, where
we considered only point sources (in the g-band) and targets be-
tween 16<g<22.5. These cuts selected a large area in colour space
(minimising the eﬀect of colour incompleteness) and therefore re-
sulted in a high sky density of targets but with signiﬁcant stellar
contamination. We relied on the combination of these cuts and the
XDQSO algorithm (see Section 4.0.6) to minimise this stellar con-
tamination, particularly for fainter targets 21.5<g<22.5.

Due to the proximity of the quasar locus to main sequence
(MS) stars, photometric errors are a concern for optical quasar
selection. Galaxies may be incorrectly identiﬁed as point-sources
from their morphology but galaxy colours are suﬃciently non-
quasar like that galaxy contamination is not considered to be prob-
lematic. Morphological incompleteness may be introduced, how-
ever, by identifying point-sources as extended sources and there-
fore not selecting them as quasar candidates. To mitigate this eﬀect
we rely on the deeper VST-ATLAS bands to perform our morpho-
logical cuts (the g and r-bands). We relied on two bands to account
for the possibility of poor image quality aﬀecting the morphologi-
cal classiﬁcation in a single band.

4.0.5 Optical and mid-IR selection

By combining the mid-infrared photometry from WISE with the
optical bands from VST-ATLAS we achieve a larger separation be-
tween the stellar locus and our target quasars than is possible using
optical colours alone (see Figure 1). Unlike the ugri colours this
selection relies on the infrared excess of emission to diﬀerentiate
between stars and quasars.
Quasars in our target redshift range have a mean g−W1 =
4 with a large dispersion ≈ ± 1. The 5σ limits are g≈23.25 and
W1≈16.83. As such the depth of our mid-IR selection is limited by
the depth of the WISE photometry.
In the centre panel of Figure 1 we show the g − i colour plot-
ted against the i−W1 colour. The stellar locus is clearly identiﬁ-
able. The right hand panel shows the mid-IR colour W1−W2 as a
function of g band magnitude. The latter colour selection helped
to remove any remaining stellar contamination that was left by the
g−i : i−W1 colour cut.

The colour cuts we applied are given here;

• (i−W1) ≥ (g − i) + 1.5
• −1 ≤ (g − i) ≤ 1.3
• (i−W1) ≤ 8
• (W1−W2) > 0.4 & g < 19.5
• (W1−W2) > −0.4g + 8.2 & g > 19.5

Within a typical 2dF pointing, this target selection returns ≈100
candidates deg−2. This algorithm therefore supplies optimal target
density to observe all candidates on the 2dF in a single exposure.
However, to meet our target density we required this algorithm to
be both highly complete and free from contamination. We used the
giW1 colours to test our morphological classiﬁcation of sources
from their g-band imaging, by separating the galaxy and stellar loci
in colour space. We determined that of the stars identiﬁed by their
colour, 91.5 ± 0.5% were identiﬁed as point sources by the g−band
morphological classiﬁcation. We tested the morphological classi-
ﬁcation in the r-band with the rzW1 colours and found a similar
value.

MNRAS 000, 1–25 (2016)

4.0.6 XDQSO Algorithm

Automated quasar selection algorithms typically compare broad-
band colours to model quasar colours (or some library of previously
observed quasars). As the VST-ATLAS survey has the same ﬁlter
set as the SDSS survey, there exists a legacy of quasar selection
code (such as Richards et al. 2004; Kirkpatrick et al. 2011; Bovy
et al. 2011). Bovy et al. (2011) demonstrated the success of the
XDQSO2 algorithm and we applied this algorithm throughout our ob-
serving program. The XDQSO algorithm takes as input the colours of
a source and compares this to empirical observations of quasars and
stars. The code outputs a relative likelihood (PQSO [0, 1]) that an
object is either a star or a quasar. The XDQSO algorithm uses SDSS
as its training data and so we must consider both colour terms be-
tween SDSS and VST-ATLAS ﬁlters and diﬀerences in photomet-
ric zeropoints. If these diﬀerences between SDSS and VST-ATLAS
are small then we shall be able to implement the XDQSO algorithm
without modiﬁcation. At the time of our spectroscopic programme,
VST-ATLAS photometry was supplied in the Vega system. To con-
vert to the SDSS system we adjusted the zeropoints of the individ-
ual VST-ATLAS tiles to get good agreement with the SDSS Stripe
82 coadd photometry for stars. In the left panel of Figure 1 we show
the outline of the stellar locus from Stripe 82; the VST-ATLAS pho-
tometry is seen to be in good agreement with this deeper photom-
etry. We refer the reader to Shanks et al. (2015) where the SDSS-
VST colour terms are shown to be small.

The output of this selection algorithm is continuous and as-
signs candidates with a relative quasar likelihood. As such, we are
not limited by a lack of candidates but by the availability of in-
strument ﬁbres. Whilst the precise sky density of XDQSO candidates
varies with image quality (and hence sky position), selecting can-
didates ranked according their PQSO value limits us to observing
candidates with PQSO (cid:38) 0.7.

5 SPECTROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS

5.1

2dF & AAOMEGA

Spectroscopic observations were made with the 2dF-AAOmega in-
strument on the AAT. The 2dF is a ﬁbre positioning system for the
AAOmega multi-object spectrograph which is capable of simulta-
neously observing 392 objects over ≈3.14 deg2 ﬁeld of view. Fibres
are positioned by a robotic arm and are fed to the spectrograph. The
2dF also implements a tumbling system that allows for a second
plate to be conﬁgured whilst the ﬁrst is being observed. AAOmega
is a dual beam spectrograph that utilises a red/blue dichroic beam
splitter, splitting the light at 5700Å. The observations were made
using the 580V and 385R gratings for the blue and red arms of
the spectrograph respectively. The gratings have resolving power
of R=1300 and central wavelengths of 4800Å and 7250Å for the
blue and red arms. The useful wavelength range in our conﬁgura-
tion is 3700Å to 8800Å.

We made no nightly observations of standard stars so our spec-
tra do not have an accurate absolute calibration. The 2DFDR3 data
reduction pipeline combines the spectra from the red and blue arms
of the spectrograph. To achieve this, the spectra are calibrated to
a common scale with an arbitrary normalisation due to unknown

aperture losses, via a transfer function derived from previous ob-
servations of the standard star EG 21.
Of the 392 2dF ﬁbres (not including 8 for guide stars) 20 ﬁ-
bres for sky subtraction. The remaining ≈372 ﬁbres were used for
science targets. The ﬁbre allocation software configure4 (v7.17) al-
lows input targets to have priorities associated with them. The ob-
serving priorities allow the software to make a decision about the
importance of placing ﬁbres. This allowed us to prioritise our spec-
troscopic targets according to their likelihood of being a quasar.
This prioritisation was one of the requirements of the target selec-
tion process.
Exposure times varied between 0.7 − 2 hours to account for
observing conditions. All our data was reduced using the 2DFDR
pipeline (v5.35) using default parameters. We measured quasar red-
shifts of the spectra with the runz programme (Saunders et al.
2004).

5.2 Resulting QSO catalogue

We developed a combination of the three techniques described in
Section 4 to optimise our quasar selection over the duration of the
pilot survey. We divided the selection into two major implementa-
tions. The ﬁrst (chronological) selection relied solely on the opti-
cal photometry from VST-ATLAS in the form of ugri and XDQSO.
Later implementation of the selection algorithm applied these tech-
niques in conjunction with optical-IR colour cuts. We label these
algorithms in Table A as “ugriXDQSO” and “ugriXDQSOW1W2” re-
spectively.

The “ugriXDQSO” target selection was based on ugri colours
with the XDQSO algorithm used to rank those targets. The
“ugriXDQSOW1W2” selection algorithm gave candidates meeting

the optical+IR conditions from Section 4.0.5 the highest prior-
ity, with remaining candidates prioritised based primarily on their
PQSO.

In Table A we present the results of our spectroscopic obser-
vations. We list the ﬁeld locations and the dates of our observa-
tions, the number of quasars identiﬁed in a given pointing, expo-
sure times, mean spectral signal-to-noise and a guide to the target
selection used.

As variation in spectral signal-to-noise aﬀects our measured
quasar density, we look to parametrise our diﬀerent ﬁelds in a
meaningful manner so that we can compare the eﬀectiveness of
our selection algorithms. To account for varying spectroscopic
incompleteness between diﬀerent observations we compare the
number of bright g≤20.5 quasars between our ﬁelds (see column
“NQS O≤20.5” in Table A). At these brighter magnitudes we are ap-
proximately spectroscopically complete for quasars. We show in
Table A the faint limit in the g-band that contains 90% of our spec-
troscopically conﬁrmed quasar sample and see that we are suitably
bright to be photometrically complete in the ugriz bands.

Having accounted for spectroscopic incompleteness we expect
variation in our measured quasar density to be primarily determined
by our selection algorithm and the number of background stars (see
Section 5.5). Whilst the VST-ATLAS is limited to high galactic
latitudes we note that the number of stars in a 2dF pointing can
vary signiﬁcantly (see Table A). We include in Table A the number
of point sources of magnitude g≤21.5 under the heading Nstars and
see this density vary by up to a factor of three. This variation is
primarily determined by galactic latitude (c.f. ≈5% from zeropoint
errors).

Our spectroscopic programme was awarded 17 nights of ob-
serving time to develop a QSO selection algorithm as preparation
for a larger programme. We obtained redshifts for ≈10 000 quasars
with apparent magnitudes g≤22.5 and < z >= 1.55 (80% of the
sample lies within 0.8<z<2.5). We present the redshift distribution
of our quasars in Figure 2 and include the redshift distributions for
2QZ, 2SLAQ and SDSS for comparison. We see that the SDSS
n(z) has a second peak at z∼3.1 which is due to a secondary colour
selection designed to identify quasars at this redshift. When com-
paring between surveys we limit to 0.3<z<2.9 and so ensure good
agreement between the redshift distributions.

5.2.1 Redshift errors

Here we consider factors which aﬀect the measurement of quasar
redshifts. Poor quality spectra will cause errors in redshift estima-
tion as well as incompleteness due to failure to identify the target
as a quasar. Reliance on a small number of quasar emission lines
will also cause systematic errors due to mis-identiﬁcation of emis-
sion features, as noted by Croom et al. (2004). We have a number
of repeat observations that we can use to quantify the redshift error.
The runz code allows for three quality ﬂags qop = 5, 4 or 3 for
reliable redshifts.

Restricting our analysis to the highest quality spectra (qop =
5) we ﬁnd a redshift error of σ(z)/z = 0.002, comparing re-
peat observations as in Croom et al. (2004). This corresponds to
∼600 km s−1 or ∼2h−1 Mpc (comoving) at our mean redshift. We
next compare the highest quality to the intermediate quality (qop =
4) spectra. We take any diﬀerence in redshift greater than ∆z = 0.01
as a redshift failure. Intermediate quality spectra have a redshift
failure rate of 6 ± 2% and an error of σ(z)/z = 0.002, excluding
∆z>0.01. Similarly we ﬁnd σ(z)/z = 0.002 for our lowest quality
spectra (qop = 3) but this time with a failure rate of 16±12%.

We quantify the rate of redshift failure due to line mis-
identiﬁcation. Having examined quasars with repeat observations
we ﬁnd that redshift failures occur for 9±1% of quasars, over all
redshifts, magnitudes and spectral quality.

5.3 Eﬀectiveness of Quasar selection methods

We introduced the optical-IR colour cuts in Section 4.0.5; we re-
view their eﬀectiveness here and compare to the XDQSO technique
which relies on UVX techniques to identify quasars. To compare
these selection techniques we examine one of the most complete
ﬁelds (23h16m − 26d01m) where we ﬁnd over 80 quasars deg−2 be-
tween 0.8<z<2.5 and 16<g<22.5.

In Figure 1 we show the distribution of our quasar sample in
the ugr, giW1 and gW1W2 colour spaces. We include only point
sources with g < 20.5. As noted in section 4.0.5 the left and mid-
dle panels of Figure 1 show a diﬀerence in distance between the
quasars and the stellar locus. At fainter magnitudes (g > 20.5) the
photometric scatter will become larger and so that the eﬀective sep-
aration between the stars (mainly type A and F) and quasars will
be reduced. The increased distance from the stellar locus seen in
giW1 (compared to the distance in ugr colour space) suggests that
this selection may suﬀer from less stellar contamination than us-
ing ugr photometry and that any stellar contamination might come
from diﬀerent spectral types of stars.

We examine the apparent purity of the giW1W2 colour selec-
tion by comparing its eﬀectiveness against the XDQSO algorithm.
We are limited in the giW1W2 selection by the depth of the WISE
photometry and so must take this into account when comparing
to the XDQSO algorithm. We limit our comparison to g<20.5 and
treat photometric and spectroscopic incompleteness for quasars as
negligible. In Table 1 we take all giW1W2 quasar candidates with
g < 20.5 and ﬁnd that 3% of these sources are stars, based on
spectroscopic observations. If we assume all of the non-identiﬁed
sources are stars, our stellar contamination rises to 14%. We test
XDQSO by taking the same target density as identiﬁed by giW1W2
and ﬁnd contamination rates of 17 − 42%, again depending on the
nature of the non-ids.
Within our target redshift range we expect to ﬁnd (cid:39)75 quasars
per 2dF pointing at this (g<20.5) magnitude limit. In Table 1 we
show the number of quasars identiﬁed by both algorithms as well
as showing (in brackets) the number of quasars common to both. In
the brighter regime (g<20.5), we ﬁnd that both algorithms identify
at least 74 quasars within our target redshift interval and so both are
consistent with being complete. However, we also note a further 9
quasars from the giW1W2 selection which corresponds to a 12%
increase against the performance of XDQSO.

The single quasar (g <= 20.5 & 0.8<z<2.5) “missed” by
giW1W2 is not detected in the All-Sky release and so was not
missed due to incompleteness introduced as a result of our cho-
sen colour selection. However, subsequent to our observations, an
improved analysis of the WISE data (the ALLWISE data release)
results in a detection for this target (W1 = 17.07, S /N = 8.5
and would be selected by our algorithm). This missing target sug-
gests that our WISE photometry has an incompleteness for quasars
within our target redshift range of ∼1%.

Some quasars are only identiﬁed by giW1W2 but not by
XDQSO. Many of these would be found by our ugr colour selec-
tion, or a simpler colour-magnitude cut. The mean “probability” of
these targets is PQSO = 0.3 and so would not be observable with-
out a much higher ﬁbre density. The XDQSO algorithm provides a
“PQSO ALLZ” parameter, that gives the “likelihood” of a target be-

ing a quasar at any redshift. For these “missed” quasars the mean
“likelihood” is PQSO ALLZ= 0.8. The low PQSO of these quasars is
apparently caused by XDQSO attempting to estimate the redshift of
the quasar candidates. The two red (u−g>0.7) quasars detected by
WISE are given low ratings by XDQSO (PQSO ALLZ = 0.81, 0.01 and
PQSO = 0.26, 0.01) and are therefore too lowly ranked by XDQSO to
be observed.
In the fainter regime, XDQSO identiﬁes a single quasar red-
der than u−g=0.7 of the 74 quasars within this redshift range. The
giW1W2 selection recovers 9 (out of 78) with red optical colours.
Combining the two selections we ﬁnd that 9% of our sample in the
fainter regime is “reddened” beyond the approximate limits of our
ugri colour selection.

We widen the redshift interval from 0.8<z<2.5 to 0.3<z<3.5,
in the expectation that errors in redshift estimation performed by
XDQSO will result in a high number of quasars outside the 0.8<z<2.5
interval. We ﬁnd that both algorithms select a signiﬁcant number of
quasars outside our targeted redshift range. For astrophysical stud-
ies of the quasar population this may not be an issue. However,
to make the highest precision measurements of clustering, surveys
require the highest density of quasars within as narrow a redshift in-
terval as possible. Targeting quasars outside our preferred redshift
interval lowers the eﬃciency of the survey.

We now examine spectroscopically conﬁrmed quasars that are
ranked as likely stars by the XDQSO algorithm. Given the contin-
uous nature of the likelihood we make a cut in the output likeli-
hood. We cut at PQSO < 0.4 as the target density above this value is
≈250 degree−2, well above what is observable in a single epoch of
spectroscopy with 2dF. After the giW1W2 selection, we ﬁnd (cid:39)10
quasars deg−2 (across all magnitudes), within our targeted redshift
range that lie within this low PQSO region.

The mid-IR excess demonstrated by quasars places them in a
region of colour space with a lower contamination rate than we
see from XDQSO. If this contamination rate were to continue to
fainter limits, then a mid-IR selection alone may be suﬃcient to
achieve the target quasar density. With the current limits from the
mid-IR photometry, which introduce photometric incompleteness,
we must supplement the mid-IR selection with XDQSO to achieve
higher quasar densities. In our sample ﬁeld XDQSO recovers a quasar
density of 54 quasars deg−2 (0.8<z<2.5, g<22.5) compared to 74
quasars deg−2 from combining WISE, VSTATLAS and XDQSO.

5.4 The nature of mid-IR non-ids

Here we examine the contaminants within the giW1W2 colour
space and attempt to discern the nature of the unidentiﬁed targets.
We look both at the conﬁrmed contaminants from a highly com-
plete ﬁeld and at the contaminants from the whole survey. Within
the highly complete region (from Section 5.3) we have three spec-
troscopically conﬁrmed stars with g<20.5. These stars are identi-
ﬁed as A and K-type stars from their spectroscopy and have been
scattered up from the stellar locus. They are anomalously red in
the i−W1 colour and hence included within our colour selection.
Over the course of the survey we identiﬁed a number of white
dwarfs (WDs) and M-type stars within our giW1 colur space. How-
ever, neither of these type of stars have broadband colours consis-
tent with being identiﬁed by our giW1 selection. WDs have colour
i−W1(cid:46)1 and M stars have g−i>1.5 so neither of these should con-
taminate the giW1 colour space.

The WIRED survey, Debes et al. (2011), categorised the in-
frared emission from UKIDSS Z-band to WISE W4 band of SDSS
DR7 WDs. WDs with an infrared excess (mostly due to a contami-
nating M star) were identiﬁed as a potential source of the observed
WD contamination of our colour space (see Debes et al. 2011).
In Figure 3 we show that the WD+M star locus overlaps with the
quasar locus in the giW1 colour space.

Debes et al. (2011) suggested that this may be due to the
M-star contributing ﬂux at longer wavelengths than the WD and
thereby giving the system quasar colours. These authors found that
28 ± 3% WDs have M dwarf companions and approximately a fur-
ther ≈2−10% have either associated dust or a brown dwarf that
would give them excess emission in the W1 band. Given the sim-
ilar depths between SDSS and ATLAS we expect a similar rate of
contamination as found by Debes et al. (2011).

To better examine the overlap between the quasar locus and
the WD+M-star locus, we take our entire quasar sample and map
its distribution in giW1 colour space in Figure 3. We show that
the WD+M binaries directly overlap with the quasar locus in this
colour space. Figure 3 explains the appearance of WDs and M stars
in the giW1 colour cut. Whilst these systems will account for the
occasional appearance of the spectroscopically conﬁrmed contam-
inants, however, they do not have a suﬃciently high sky density to
account for the majority of the unidentiﬁed sources. We attempt to
ﬁnd a colour space that separates the stars and quasars that appear
in the giW1W2 colour selection. If we are able to separate the stars
and quasars by colour selection we may be able to infer the nature
of the unidentiﬁed targets. We use all our observed targets to better
characterise the contamination. In the right panel of Figure 4 we
show the gW1W2 plane. We show as reference the position of the
stellar locus, the locations of spectral type A and M stars, as well as
the WDs with excess IR emission. We also show the quasar locus
(derived from our whole sample). Spectroscopic stars and non-ids
with g < 20.5 that obey our giW1W2 colour selection are also plot-
ted. We see from the right panel of Figure 4 that the majority of stars
may be removed by a cut in the W1−W2 colour. Due to the close
proximity of the stellar locus, a cut in this colour may improve our
eﬃciency but will aﬀect our completeness as well. Where we have
J-band coverage from the VHS survey (McMahon et al. 2013), we
see from the left panel of Figure 4 that the J−W1 colour increases
the separation between the stellar locus and the quasar locus. The
majority of the non-ids lie within the quasar locus, although some
do lie closer to the stellar locus. Table 2 quantiﬁes that their mean
J−W1 colours are consistent with quasar colours. Given that the
number counts for non-ids peak a magnitude fainter than the peak

from the entire survey, in the giW1 colour space (green contour). We include
morphological point-sources (identiﬁed by the g-band with 16<g<20.5;
shown as grey contour) and our giW1 colour cuts (dashed purple lines)
from Section 4.0.5 for reference. We show that the WD+M binaries from
Debes et al. (2011) (red contour) directly overlap with the quasar locus in
this colour space acting to reduce the eﬃciency of this colour selection.

identiﬁed by our spectroscopic observations.

are quasars where positive identiﬁcation has failed due to spectro-
scopic incompleteness.

5.5 Background stellar density

We ﬁnd that the measured spectroscopic quasar density varies
across the sky, independently of the selection algorithm (see Table
A). Spectroscopic incompleteness will contribute to this variation.
We minimise this by considering only sources with g<20.5, where
we are approximately complete. In Figure 5 we show the variation
of conﬁrmed quasars with g<20.5 as a function of the number of
point sources with g<21.5 per square degree.

Figure 5 shows that the inverse correlation between stellar
density and spectroscopic quasar density is the dominant cause of
varying quasar density across the sky. This aﬀect results in as much

as a factor of two between conﬁrmed quasars in ﬁelds with dif-
ferent background stellar densities. This relation indicates that the
eﬃciency of a wide area quasar survey depends on the background
stellar counts in the observed ﬁelds.

However, we also note that the ugriXDQSOW1W2 algorithm
ﬁelds consistently identify a higher number density of quasars then
the ugriXDQSO algorithm.

5.6 Conclusions

:

We combined mid-IR photometry from WISE with the ugriz pho-
tometry from the VST-ATLAS survey to improve the eﬃciency of
our quasar selection. We found that the giW1 colour space (see
Figure 1) is approximately complete to g<20.5. Fainter than this
the colour space becomes photometrically incomplete as quasars
become too faint to be detected in the W1 band of WISE. We
next attempted to use broadband colours to identify fainter (in the
g-band) candidates from the g−i
i−W1 colour space that we
were unable to identify from spectroscopy. Further analysis with
the J-band failed to prove conclusively that the unidentiﬁed targets
in this colour space were stars. These targets exhibit broad band
colours consistent with quasars. This could mean that the colour
space is complete to fainter limits in g than found in this work. We
found that the combination of optical and mid-IR photometry im-
proved the eﬃciency of our quasar selection. In Figure 5 we see that
ﬁelds where WISE photometry was included in the quasar selection
saw an increased yield of ≈10 quasars deg−2. The improvement in
quasar selection that we found in this survey may readily be ex-
tended to other quasar surveys in a similar redshift range such as
eBOSS. Furthermore, we note that WISE photometry has proven
to be a boon for quasar selection at higher redshifts (Carnall et al.
2015).

6 CLUSTERING ANALYSIS
6.1 Correlation function estimators

6.1.1 Redshift space correlation function

The two-point correlation function, ξ(r), is commonly used to mea-
sure the excess probability of ﬁnding a pair of objects separated by
distance r over a pair of randomly distributed objects. This proba-
bility is given by Peebles (1980) as;

dP = n2[1 + ξ(r)]dV1dV2

(1)

where n is the mean space density of objects and dV are volume el-
ements around object 1 and 2. When measuring quasar positions we
measure their distribution in redshift space and so we recover ξ(s)
instead of ξ(r). To recover an estimate for ξ(s) we use the estimator
of Landy & Szalay (1993);

ξLS (s) =

<DD> − 2<DR> + <RR>

<RR>

(2)

Here <DD> is the number of quasar-quasar pairs at a given sepa-
ration, denoted by s. The <DR> and <RR> terms correspond to
the number of quasar-random and random-random pairs respec-
tively. To reduce the Poisson noise, we calculate the DR and RR
terms from a much larger (twenty times larger) sample of randoms
than we have quasars. It is necessary to normalise these terms by
the measured quasar density. As discussed in Section 5.5 our mea-
sured quasar density varies by as much as a factor of two over the

Figure 4. In the left panel we show the stellar locus in gJW1 colour space (grey contours). We also plot the locus of our quasar sample (green contours).
Targets without a spectroscopic id that fulﬁl the giW1W2 colour cuts are shown as grey ﬁve point stars and spectroscopically conﬁrmed stars are shown as
black triangles. We also mark the location of spectral type A and M stars as well as the location of WD+IR excess stars from Debes et al. (2011). In the right
panel we follow the same convention for marking the quasar and stellar locus, but instead show these in the g−W1 vs. W1−W2 colour space. The majority
of non-ids have colours consistent with quasars in giJW1W2 photometric bands and suggest that the failure to positively identify these targets is due to
spectroscopic incompleteness.

sky as a result of variation in our selection function and observ-
ing conditions. We therefore normalise our random sample on a
ﬁeld by ﬁeld basis dependent on the total number of quasars in a
given ﬁeld. This normalisation should help counter eﬀects of pho-
tometric and spectroscopic incompleteness. Assuming quasar clus-
tering to be described by a power-law with a correlation scale of
r0=6.1 h−1Mpc and slope γ=1.8 the aﬀect of the integral constraint
from a single 2dF ﬁeld is suﬃciently small to have little eﬀect on
our measurements and only aﬀects clustering measurements on the
largest (≈100 h−1Mpc) physical scales.

6.1.2 Modelling quasar clustering in redshift space
Following the methodology of other quasar surveys (da ˆAngela
et al. (2005),dA08) we deﬁne ξ(s) = ξ(σ2 + π2) where σ is the
pairwise separation perpendicular to the line of sight and π is par-
allel to the line of sight and

1 + ξ(σ, π) =

(cid:48)(σ, π − wz(1 + z)/H(z))] f (wz)dwz

(3)
and ξ(cid:48)(σ, π − wz(1 + z)/H(z)) is given by equations 12-14 of da
ˆAngela et al. (2005). These equations are completely equivalent to
modelling the linear z-space distortions via the ‘Kaiser boost’ of
ξ(s) = ξ(r(1 + 2/3β + 1/5β2)) where β(z) = Ωm(z)0.6/b(z) is the in-
fall parameter and b(z) is the bias. f (wz) is the distribution of pair-
wise peculiar velocities, wz, that includes the small-scale clustering
√
motions of the quasars. From the above we can then derive ξ(s)
σ2 + π2. Fitting ξ(s) will form our main route to mea-
where s =
suring quasar clustering amplitudes. We ﬁt the correlation function

against the number of stellar sources deg−2 (with g < 21.5 ). We compare
the two algorithms; ugriXDQSO (red circles) and ugriXDQSOW1W2 (blue
triangles). By limiting the comparison to brighter quasars we assume the
contribution of observational eﬀects is negligible.

between 5<s(h−1Mpc)<55 and assume a power-law model for ξ(r)
with ξ(r) = (r/r0)−γ and with a ﬁxed γ = 1.8.
At small scales (s(cid:46)5h−1 Mpc) redshift space distortions domi-
nate the clustering signal in ξ(s). Non-linear,‘ﬁnger-of-God’ pecu-
liar velocities of the quasars and redshift measurement errors both
act to reduce ξ(s) at these scales. Justiﬁed mainly by the good ﬁt it
provides, we shall assume a Gaussian for f (wz) (see Ratcliﬀe 1996)
with a ﬁxed velocity dispersion of (cid:104)w2
z(cid:105) 1
2 = 750 kms−1.

To ﬁt ξ(s) we need an initial model for quasar bias and its
dependence on redshift. We shall assume the previous 2QZ ﬁt of
C05;

b = 0.53 + 0.289(1 + z)2.

(4)
This implies a ±10% diﬀerence to 1 + 2/3β(z) in the 0.5 < z < 2.5
range wrt. the median redshift z=1.4. This corresponds to a ±5%
eﬀect in r0. Therefore, we cannot assume that β is independent of
redshift in ﬁtting ξ(s) for r0. We ﬁt ξ(s) using the above model for
bias and we shall check for consistency with our new results for the
z dependence of bias at the end of our analysis.

6.2

2QDESp Quasar correlation function

We present the z-space two point correlation function, ξ(s), mea-
sured from the 2QDESp sample for 0.3≤z≤3.5 in Figure 6.
Widening the redshift interval from our targeted redshift range
(0.8<z<2.5) maximises the signal of the correlation function. We
have considered two estimates of the errors, Poisson and jackknife.
At small enough scales and sparse enough space densities, it is well
√
known that the errors in ξ can be approximated by Poisson errors.
Usually measured as ∆ξ(s) = 1+ξ(s)/
< DD >, which is the error
assuming that the clustering signal is zero. However, in cases where
value of ξ(s) is negative, this estimate under predicts the error. In
these cases we model the Poisson error to be;

(cid:114)

∆ξ(s) =

1 + ξ(s)MODEL
< DR >observed

(5)

When a bin in s is well populated with quasar-quasar pairs this error
estimate and the Poisson error approximately converge. The error
estimate of equation 5 is used only within Section 6.3.2 due to the
s bins being more sparsely sampled. We note that this error appears
insensitive to a range of model r0 values and is instead sensitive to
the < DR >observed value.

At these smaller scales, the covariance between ξ estimates
may be ignored in ﬁts on the basis that the pair counts are close
to being independent. We demonstrate his by comparing jackknife
and Poisson errors for 2QDESp. To calculate the jackknife errors,
we split the data into ≈60 subsamples (each separate 2dF pointing)
and calculate the error using a jackknife approach described by:

(cid:118)(cid:116) N(cid:88)

i=1

σ jackkni f e =

DRi(s)
DRtotal(s)

(ξi(s) − ξtotal(s))2,

(6)

where N is the total number of subsamples, the i subscript denotes
which 2dF ﬁeld has been removed from the whole sample and the
total subscript denotes use of the full sample. Here we weight each
term within the sum by the number of data-random pairs excluded
from the calculation and so weight more densely sampled ﬁelds
more highly than those with fewer data random pairs.

For comparison, we show the ratio of the jackknife error esti-
mation to Poisson errors in the top panel of Figure 6. We see that
the Poisson error is a reasonable representation of the jackknife
error out to s<30 h−1Mpc and is still within a factor of ≈1.4 at

Figure 6. We show the measured ξ(s) for the 2QDESp quasar sample be-
tween 0.3<z<3.5. We include our model with best-ﬁtting correlation length
(using Jackknife errors) of r0=6.25±0.30h−1Mpc. In the top panel, we show
the ratio between the Jackknife and Poisson errors.

s<55h−1Mpc, only reaching a factor of ≈1.8 at s≈100−200h−1Mpc.
This suggests that, at least out to s<55 h−1Mpc, pair counts are rea-
sonably independent and this is supported by the small size of oﬀ-
diagonal terms in the covariance matrix at these scales. We shall
ﬁt models in the range 5<s<55 h−1Mpc using both jackknife and
Poisson errors.

We now ﬁt the model from Section 6.1.2 to the 2QDESp ξ(s)
data. We show our best-ﬁtting model assuming Poisson errors in
the lower panel of Figure 6. This has r0 = 6.25±0.25 h−1Mpc
which ﬁts well with χ2 = 9.4 with 10 degrees-of-freedom, (df.).
Assuming jackknife errors for the ﬁt gives a similar result, r0 =
6.25±0.30 h−1Mpc (χ2,df.= 7.0, 10).

To further test the quality of our data, we divide the quasar
sample into three subsets, based on the quality of their optical spec-
tra. The three subsets consist of 1675, 4585 and 3541 quasars for
the highest, intermediate and lowest quality spectra respectively.
We compare the diﬀerent quality spectra in Figure 7, where we plot
the correlation function for the three quasar subsamples. We ﬁt the
model from Section 6.1.2 to each and ﬁnd that the three subsam-
ples agree at the ∼1σ level. Using this procedure we verify that our
lowest quality optical spectra are suitable to use in our science mea-
surements as the contamination by other sources is low enough not
to cause signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the measured clustering signal.

6.3 Luminosity dependence of clustering

In this section we search for evidence of luminosity dependent
quasar clustering. We start with the approach of S11 and com-
pare measured r0 values between diﬀerent surveys at approximately
ﬁxed redshift. We follow this with the more precise methodology
of dA08 which divides the samples by absolute magnitude and red-
shift. We defer measurement of redshift dependence to Section 6.4.

Table 3. We present model ﬁts for the re-analysed data sets, 2QZ, 2SLAQ and SDSS DR5 as well as for the 2QDESp sample. We restrict our analysis to
quasars between 0.3 < z < 2.9 to ensure good agreement between the redshift distributions. We include the best-ﬁtting r0, the faint limits of the quasar samples
as well as their median magnitudes, redshifts and number of quasars. We note that limiting our analysis (in the case of 2QDESp) to this redshift interval
changes the best ﬁtting value compared to Section 6.2. However, this change is < 1σ and is discussed in Section 6.4.

best-ﬁt r0 for each survey, assuming a ﬁxed β. We permit use of
constant β here because with the small diﬀerence in median red-
shifts the eﬀect of diﬀerent β(z) values will have < 1% eﬀect on
r0. Our best-ﬁtting values are shown in Table 3 and these measure-
ments agree with the analysis of S11 with any diﬀerences in the
best-ﬁt values due to slight diﬀerence in redshift range and ﬁtting
interval.

We make a comparison between the median magnitude and
best-ﬁt values of r0 across the four surveys in Figure 9. We note
that Shen et al. (2009) found that the brightest SDSS DR5 quasars
clustered more strongly than the rest of their quasar sample. We
ﬁnd here that r0 for the SDSS quasars is larger than the r0 values
from the other surveys but only at ≈1σ level. As this eﬀect corre-
sponds to the result reported by Shen et al. (2009) we must be cau-
tious not to immediately dismiss the diﬀerence as purely statistical.
However, we further test for the dependence on r0 with magnitude
using the Spearman rank correlation test. We ﬁnd a Spearman rank
order correlation of ρ= − 0.19 ± 0.37 which is consistent with no
correlation between apparent magnitude and clustering scale. We
also ﬁnd that the points in Figure 9 are consistent with a constant
r0 = 6.10+0.10−0.10 h−1Mpc with χ2,df.= 3.9, 3 and p-value= 0.28.
In Table 3 we calculate the corresponding χ2 when we com-
pare each survey individually to a ﬁxed r0 = 6.1h−1Mpc and we ﬁnd
that the total χ2,df.= 46.8, 40 (we include the individual survey χ2
values in Table 3). So from this analysis we are unable to reject the
hypothesis that quasar clustering is independent of luminosity from
a comparison between the individual surveys.

6.3.2 Absolute magnitude

In Section 6.3.1 we compared quasar clustering over a range of
∼3.5 magnitudes at ﬁxed redshift. Although further subdivision of
the quasar samples will yield weaker statistical constraints, we are,
however, able to probe a much larger dynamic range (−22.3 <
Mi(z = 2) < −28.5) at ﬁxed redshift by combining all four surveys.
We do this by taking the error weighted mean of the four correlation
functions for each subsample. Following the approach of dA08, we
divide the M-z plane into non-overlapping bins. We use the sample
binning of dA08 which was designed to maximise the clustering
signal from the 2QZ+2SLAQ combined sample. The inclusion of
the SDSS and 2QDESp data reduces the statistical errors; particu-
larly in the highest and lowest luminosity bins. This may enable us
to potentially uncover previously hidden dependencies.

We therefore subdivide the quasar samples into thirteen, non-
overlapping subsets in luminosity and redshift. The absence of low-
luminosity quasars at high redshift limits the dynamic range (in

Figure 7. Here we show the correlation function for 2QDESp quasars with
the highest, intermediate and lowest quality spectra, qop = 5,4 and 3 re-
spectively. We oﬀset the high and low spectral quality correlation functions
along the x-axis by 10s±0.02 for clarity. The three correlation functions for
each quality level agree. Hence we argue that the lowest quality sample is
suitable for use in our analysis.

6.3.1 Apparent magnitude

Comparison between the 2QZ, SDSS, 2SLAQ and 2QDESp quasar
surveys provides an opportunity to measure the dependence of clus-
tering on luminosity. Whilst each survey has diﬀerent selection
methods and ﬂux limits we see in Figure 2 that the resulting redshift
distributions are similar (see also Table 3). Given that each survey
is ﬂux limited, we account for photometric and spectroscopic in-
completenesses by characterising each survey by its median mag-
nitude. For the four surveys this corresponds to; g=18.8 (SDSS),
g=20.1 (2QZ, see Richards et al. (2005) for bJ − g conversion),
g=21.3 (2SLAQ) and g=20.6 for the 2QDESp sample.

In Figure 8 we show our re-analysis of the SDSS, 2QZ,
2SLAQ and 2QDESp clustering results, restricting our analysis to
quasars between 0.3<z<2.9. We have rebinned the s-axis to a com-
mon binning across the four surveys. In each panel we show the

Figure 8. Each panel shows our estimate of ξ(s) measured for a particular wide area survey as labelled. We annotate each panel with the median magnitude in
g for comparison to our survey. Errors are Poisson. We ﬁt the data using the model from section 6.1.2, where we assume Gaussian velocity dispersions in real
space, γ = 1.8 with a velocity dispersion, (cid:104)ω2(cid:105) 1
2 = 750 km s−1. In each panel we show the model where r0=6.1 h−1Mpc (solid line) (see section 6.1.2). For
each survey we restrict the analysis to the redshift interval 0.3<z<2.9 as this range is well sampled by all surveys. The best-ﬁtting models for the individual
surveys are shown in Table 3.

luminosity) at the higher redshifts. We calculate the absolute mag-
nitudes Mi using

Mi = i − Ai − 25 − 5log(d) − Ki,

(7)

where i is the apparent magnitude, Ai is the dust extinction, d is the
luminosity distance in Mpc and Ki is the k-correction in the i-band.
The galactic dust correction, Ai is calculated by Ai = 2.086 E(B −
V) (Schlegel et al. 1998). The k-correction value was taken from
Richards et al. (2006).

We show the distribution of the 2QDESp sample in the left
hand panel of Figure 10. We overlay the Figure with the M-z di-
visions and include the occupancy of each division. In the right
panel of Figure 10 we plot the M-z distribution for the combined
(SDSS+2QZ+2SLAQ+2QDESp) sample. Again, we overlay the
M-z divisions and show the total bin occupancy. In both panels of
Figure 10 the ﬂux limited nature of the surveys is evident by the ab-

sence of lower luminosity quasars at higher redshifts. As expected,
we see that the 2QDESp survey makes its largest contribution at
fainter absolute luminosities.

Our aim in subdividing the combined sample in both magni-
tude and in redshift is to isolate redshift and luminosity dependent
eﬀects on the clustering amplitude. In Figure 11 we show the sig-
nal for each of the absolute magnitude and redshift bins. To gener-
ate random samples we use R.A.-Dec. mixing (see C05), sampling
from the all magnitudes and redshifts to generate the angular mask.
The radial mask is generated by randomly sampling the redshift
distribution of the magnitude-redshift subsample. We found that
ﬁtting the radial distribution with a polynomial provided similar
results to those included here.
Previously we ﬁt for r0 at approximately ﬁxed redshift. How-
ever, here we are ﬁtting over ∆z∼1.7 and so an assumption of con-
stant β is no longer valid. We therefore measure the correlation

nosity and halo mass. However, we note that these magnitude-
redshift bins correspond to the faintest apparent magnitudes in the
2QDESp and 2SLAQ samples and suﬀer from large incomplete-
ness. So although there may be a weak underlying dependence on
luminosity we are unable to claim a signiﬁcant detection analysing
the data in this fashion. It is possible, of course, that some eﬀect of
luminosity dependence is being masked by the redshift dependence
of quasar clustering.

6.4 Redshift dependence

In Figure 12 we see evidence for redshift dependence of quasar
clustering and ﬁnd that the increase in r0 with redshift is signiﬁ-
cantly detected using the Spearman rank order correlation test (ρ =
0.82 ± 0.18). Here we attempt to measure the evolution of quasar
clustering with redshift. Following the methodology of earlier au-
thors (C05; dA08) we use the integrated correlation function. We
measure the clustering excess up to some radius (s < 20 h−1Mpc)
and normalise the signal according to the average quasar numbers
contained within a 20 h−1Mpc radius sphere;

function for each subsample in Figure 11 but determining β(z) from
an assumed b(z) relationship (see equation 4). Whilst there is un-
certainty in the precise form of the b(z), a 50% increase in bias at
z = 1.5 only results in a 4% change in r0.

Allowing the value of r0 to vary between each bin we ﬁnd
a total χ2,df.= 130.6, 130 and p-value= 0.47. We plot the best-ﬁt
values (see Table 4) in Figure 12. We also include in this Figure
our determination of r0 from the measured ξ(s) of Eftekharzadeh
et al. (2015); using our model we ﬁnd their correlation function
corresponds to r0=7.25±0.1 h−1 Mpc.

In Figure 12 we compare across the luminosity bins at approx-
imately ﬁxed redshift. The fainter two magnitude bins (spanning
−24.5<Mi<−22.3) show, on average, stronger clustering at all red-
shifts than the brighter bins. If this trend is physical it would sug-
gest that fainter quasars are more strongly clustered than brighter
quasars, suggesting an inverse relationship between quasar lumi-

MNRAS 000, 1–25 (2016)

C05 in particular looked at the eﬀect of both systematic and sta-
tistical uncertainties associated with integrating diﬀerent radius
spheres. We adopt the same radius as used by these authors (see
C05, for a detailed analysis).

In Figure 13 we show the integrated correlation function for
each absolute magnitude and redshift bin from Section 6.3.2. We
show the redshifts and ξ20 values for these bins in Table 4. We see
that the evolution of ξ20(z) is ﬂatter than one might naively expect
from either Table 4 or Figure 12. This is due to the eﬀect of β(z),
accounted for in our model, that “boosts” ξ20(z) more at lower red-
shifts than at higher redshifts and thus ﬂattens the evolution of ξ20.

6.4.1 Bias & Halo Masses

2QZ measured the quasar correlation function as a function of
redshift (see C05). They reported the relationship of quasar bias
with redshift described by equation 4. In this section we use the
same methodology as previous works (C05;dA08 and R09) with
our larger dataset to more precisely determine the evolution of bias
with redshift.

Section 6.3.2 where we discussed the eﬀect of diﬀerent b(z) mod-

lier sections and ﬁnd changes in the best-ﬁt values are of the order

Zaldarriaga & Seljak 2000). Under our assumed cosmology we ﬁnd
ξρ
20(r) = 0.253 at z = 0. We can then use linear theory to convert
from a measured ξQ

error weighted mean to combine the measurements from each individual survey, where errors are Poisson (see Section 6.2). These are compared to a ξ(s)
model where r0 = 6.1h−1 Mpc (solid line). We show the ﬁt quality for this ﬁxed r0 value as well as for the best-ﬁtting value in Table 4.

quasar clustering from our measurements of r0. We compare the
halo masses for diﬀerent magnitude bins to re-examine those re-
sults. It is at higher redshift that we are best able to distinguish
between diﬀerent mass halos from their bias values as such we ex-

clude the faintest luminosity bin as there was no data at higher red-
shifts.

The clustering of the remaining three magnitude bins is best
described by halo masses of 6±8×1012h−1M(cid:12), 1.9±1.4×1012h−1M(cid:12)
and 2.2 ± 0.2 × 1012h−1M(cid:12) (rms error) for the −24.5<Mi< − 23.5,
−25.5<Mi< − 24.5 and −28.5<Mi< − 25.5 bins respectively.

We ﬁnd that (excluding the high-z, low-M bin) the evolution
of bias with redshift is well described by a mean halo mass of M =
2± 1× 1012h−1M(cid:12) (c.f. M = 3± 5× 1012h−1M(cid:12) including this bin).
We show the model prediction for this halo mass in Figure 14 as a
solid line. Within the errors, our bias measurements are consistent
with a single halo mass at all redshifts and luminosities.

Our measurement of the evolution of b(z) is slightly diﬀerent
than that of C05, the determination of halo mass has large errors.

As such, our best-ﬁt halo mass is lower than that of C05 but remains

6.5 Comparison to XMM-COSMOS quasar clustering

The semi-analytic model presented by Fanidakis et al. (2013) pre-
dict that X-ray selected quasars inhabit higher mass halos than op-
tically selected quasars. Fanidakis et al. (2013) present halo mass
estimates from Allevato et al. (2011) and Krumpe et al. (2012)
are presented as observational support to this model as these halo
masses are higher (∼1013M(cid:12)) than estimates from wide area optical
studies (∼1012M(cid:12)). In this section we brieﬂy examine to whether
this diﬀerence in halo mass estimates may be reconciled with the
lack of dependence on optical luminosity found here. In particu-
lar, diﬀerences may occur due to diﬀering analysis methods, and so
we apply our method used for our optically selected samples to the
X-ray selected sample of Allevato et al. (2011).

Allevato et al. (2011) measured the correlation function for
quasars in the XMM-COSMOS ﬁeld (Brusa et al. 2010) and found
a clustering scale of r0 = 7.08+0.30−0.28h−1 Mpc and γ = 1.88+0.04−0.06. We
examine the sample of quasars used in their work and that ﬁnd
gmedian=21.4 (∼0.1 magnitudes fainter than the 2SLAQ sample) and
their space density of quasars is ∼90deg−2 which is similar to that
reached by 2QDESp, see Table A. Further, the redshift distribution
of their X-ray selected sources (Figure 2; Allevato et al. 2011) is
comparable to those of optically selected studies (see Figure 2). As
we ﬁnd no evidence for r0 increasing with fainter magnitude, we
believe their contradictory result worthy of further scrutiny.

Firstly, we note that an earlier clustering analysis of the

2011) was performed by Gilli et al. (2009) who measured r0 =
7.03+0.96−0.89 h−1 Mpc with γ=1.8. We use the R.A.−Dec. mixing ap-
proach of Gilli et al. (2009) to generate a random catalogue. How-
ever, instead of measuring w(rp) we measure the redshift correla-
tion function, ξ(s), for these data, assuming γ = 1.8 as in Section
6.3.1 for the ﬁt. Gilli et al. (2009) compared this method of random
generation to modelling the angular distribution and found that it
can underestimate the true correlation length. Applying the correc-
tion from Gilli et al. (2009) we ﬁnd that the amplitude of clustering
is described by r0=6.03+0.80−1.00 h−1 Mpc. This is in agreement with the
measurements of quasar clustering at z≈1.5 found in this work.

Both the r0 measurements from Gilli et al. (2009) and Alle-
vato et al. (2011) use the projected correlation function, w(rp), as
opposed to the redshift-space correlation function, ξ(s), that we use.
By remeasuring the correlation function we are able to compare di-
rectly to optical results. As noted by other authors (Mountrichas &
Georgakakis 2012; Krumpe et al. 2012) this approach should pro-
vide a more robust comparison than comparing between diﬀerent
bias or halo mass models.
We also note that our errors (and those of Gilli et al. 2009) as-
sume Poisson statistics and still lead to a factor of 2−3× larger er-
rors on r0 than the ≈±0.3 h−1Mpc quoted by Allevato et al. (2011);
it is not clear why this is the case. If the statistical errors on the
XMM-COSMOS results are as large as found by Gilli et al. (2009)
and ourselves then we conclude that these data contain no signiﬁ-
cant evidence for luminosity dependent clustering e.g. compared to
their brighter counterparts in Figure 9 (see also discussion in next
section).

6.6 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations

Here we extend our analysis of the combined quasar sample to
larger scales. In Figure 15 we show the result of combining the
four correlation functions from each of the four surveys, weight-
ing inversely according to the square of the errors at each separa-
tion (section 6.3.1). We measure r0=6.10±0.15h−1Mpc for a sample
containing 70940 quasars with <z> = 1.49. Combining these sur-
veys gives an eﬀective volume of ≈0.6h−3Gpc3, larger than the orig-
inal SDSS LRG survey of Eisenstein et al. (2005) (≈0.55 h−3Gpc3
or the 2dFGRS survey of Cole et al. (2005) (≈0.1 h−3Gpc3) where
BAO were detected. We use CAMB to predict the ΛCDM correla-
tion function and scale this model to agree with the measured ξ(s)
at intermediate scales, 5<s<55h−1Mpc (see Figure 15). Comparing
the model to the data ξ(s) at larger scales, 60<s<200 h−1Mpc, we
ﬁnd that the model with the BAO feature is ﬁt with χ2,df.=5.5,4
and p-value=0.23 compared to χ2,df.= 6.1, 4 and p-value=0.19 for
a similar model without BAO. Although the model with the BAO
feature ﬁts better, the reduction in χ2 is not signiﬁcant (∆χ2 ≈ 0.6)
and so it is not possible to claim that the BAO feature is detected in
this combined quasar survey.

We consider possible explanations for this lack of detection.
Firstly, the statistical errors are still relatively large, larger still once
the oﬀ-diagonal covariance matrix elements are considered, moti-
vating the need for bigger samples with larger eﬀective volumes
at the BAO scale. However, we have argued above that the ef-
fective volume should already be large enough for the detection
of this feature. Secondly, it does not appear that the ±750km s−1
quasar redshift error plus intrinsic velocity dispersion aﬀect the de-
tectability of the BAO peak, as evidenced by convolving the ΛCDM
model with Gaussians of this width. Our 9% fraction of misidenti-
ﬁed quasar redshifts will reduce the BAO signal and the small scale

Figure 15. At each s bin we combine the values of the correlation func-
tion ξ(s) for each of the four surveys using the error weighted mean. This
combined sample consists of NQS O = 70 940 with mean redshift ¯z = 1.49.
We ﬁt our model form Section 6.1.2 to the data and ﬁnd a best-ﬁt value for
r0 = 6.10±0.10 h−1Mpc with χ2,df.= 15.6, 10 where we ﬁt in the range
5<s(h−1Mpc)<55 (shown as the solid line). We also include the prediction
of linear theory from CAMB and the ‘no wiggle’ model of Eisenstein & Hu
(1998) with both normalised to our correlation function amplitude between

signal in proportion and so this eﬀect has already been accounted
for in Figure 15 by our procedure of scaling the model to the ob-
served small-scale ξ(s). Thus it remains unclear why the BAO peak
is undetected in these data.

7 DISCUSSION

We have analysed quasar clustering using surveys covering a wide
range of ﬂuxes and luminosities. We have found that there is lit-
tle evidence for an increase of clustering amplitude with luminos-
ity within the optical surveys at ﬁxed redshift. Even including the
XMM-COSMOS survey, we still ﬁnd no evidence for the depen-
dence of the clustering scale on luminosity. Following S11 we as-
sume a halo-black hole mass relation of the form MBH∼M1.82
Halo (Fer-
rarese 2002) and the bias b∼M0.2
Halo (Martini & Weinberg 2001) to-
gether with a ﬁxed Eddington ratio we expect the approximate re-
lation r0 ∝ b ∝ M0.1
BH ∝ L0.1. Given the factor of ≈10 increase
in luminosity between the SDSS and 2SLAQ samples, a factor of
≈1.25 increase in r0 is predicted, corresponding to r0 increasing
from 6.20 (2SLAQ) to 7.75 h−1Mpc, signiﬁcantly (≈4σ) higher
than the observed value from SDSS. Thus, the observed lumi-
nosity dependence of the clustering amplitude is about a ﬁfth of
what is predicted on the basis of this simple model. This is con-
ﬁrmed by the formal χ2 ﬁts of the L0.1 model in Figure 9. Exclud-
ing XMM-COSMOS, we ﬁnd χ2,df.=7.8,3 and p-value=0.05 for
the L0.1 model compared to χ2,df.=3.8,3 and p-value=0.23 for the
L−independent case. Including XMM-COSMOS, the same pref-
erence for the L independent model is shown, although the L0.1

model is slightly less rejected with p-value=0.10. But if the XMM-
COSMOS r0 was closer to its corrected value of r0=6.0 h−1Mpc,
rather than the r0=5.2h−1Mpc we have assumed here, then the level
of rejection of the L0.1 model would again be increased. We con-
clude that any dependence of clustering amplitude with luminosity
is smaller than expected from a simple halo model.

When we then sub-divided the combined SDSS, 2QZ, 2SLAQ
and 2QDESp surveys by absolute magnitude and redshift to in-
crease the dynamic range in luminosity, we again found no evi-
dence for luminosity dependent clustering at ﬁxed redshift. How-
ever, we note that we do have signiﬁcant evidence for the depen-
dence of r0 on redshift. We introduced a new bias model for b(z)
(equation 4), superseding that of C05. We ﬁnd that our model for
the evolution of bias with redshift is consistent with the higher
r0 = 7.25±0.10h−1Mpc measured by Eftekharzadeh et al. (2015) in
the BOSS quasar survey at z≈2.4.
The 2QZ results of C05 suggest that a ﬁxed halo mass of
∼1012.5M(cid:12) ﬁts the z dependence of quasar clustering. Here we have
conﬁrmed the results of S11 that at approximately ﬁxed redshift
the clustering amplitude is approximately constant with luminos-
ity. The apparent luminosity independence would suggest that the
halo mass and hence black hole mass was virtually constant as a
function of both luminosity and redshift.

If all quasars have the same black hole mass over a wide range
of luminosity then there is a contradiction with all quasars radiat-
ing at a ﬁxed fraction of Eddington as suggested from reverberation
studies of nearby quasars (Peterson et al. 2004). To reconcile these
two observations requires that the BH−halo mass relation is broken.
There is some evidence for this from the work of Kormendy & Ben-
der (2011) who found that the BH mass was more related to bulge
mass than halo mass. In this view quasars would ﬁnd themselves
in similar sized haloes but with black hole masses more related to
their luminosity.

A weak clustering dependence on luminosity is expected in
‘ﬂickering’ models where the duty cycle for AGN activity is short
and the quasar luminosity is highly variable (Lidz et al. 2006). The
luminosity of a quasar may also be taken as implying a lower limit
to its black-hole mass via the Eddington limit. Thus low luminosity
quasars must be accreting at a highly sub-Eddington rate if the halo-
mass BH mass relation is to be preserved, since they have similar
halo masses to their brighter counterparts. This means that quasars
are preferentially seen in bright phases. S11 again noted that this
model contradicts the established correlation from reverberation
mapping between black hole mass and luminosity (Peterson et al.
2004) but otherwise ﬁts the clustering data (by design).
In Section 6.4.1 we estimate the halo bias for optically se-
lected quasars between 0.3<z<2.9 and −28.5<Mi(z=2)< − 23.5. In
agreement with earlier works (C05; dA08; R09; S11) we ﬁnd a
characteristic halo mass of MHalo=2±1×1012h−1M(cid:12). Recent mea-
surements of quasar clustering from X-ray surveys (Gilli et al.
2009; Allevato et al. 2011; Krumpe et al. 2012) have estimated sig-
niﬁcantly higher halo masses (∼1013M(cid:12)) than the above optically
selected samples.

Semi-analytical models of AGN (Fanidakis et al. 2013) have
suggested that this is a physical result caused by a diﬀerence in
AGN fuelling modes between optically selected and X-ray selected
samples. However, given the susceptibility of soft X-ray selection
(≈0.1 − 2keV) to intrinsic obscuration we would expect these two
selections to sample the same population of AGN. This is sup-
ported by the similar space density and redshift distribution of un-
obscured X-ray AGN and optically selected quasars (see Allevato
et al. 2011).

Indeed, both Krumpe et al. (2012) and Allevato et al. (2011)
explicitly compare the clustering of optically selected quasars with
unobscured X-ray AGN in their two samples. In both papers these
authors ﬁnd that the clustering of both populations (at any redshift)
may be described by the same halo mass. Contrary to the claim of
Allevato et al. (2011) we ﬁnd consistent clustering of X-ray and
optically selected samples. As such, we see little evidence for the
higher halo masses in these studies (c.f. optical studies) that would
support the suggestion of Fanidakis et al. (2013) that the two pop-
ulations are driven by diﬀerent accretion modes. The analysis by
Mountrichas et al. (2013) suggests that higher X-ray AGN masses
are in fact driven by X-ray AGN from groups. After excluding these
AGN, Mountrichas et al. (2013) ﬁnd the clustering of X-ray se-
lected AGN is described by a halo mass 5+4−3×1012h−1M(cid:12), consistent
with the clustering results presented here.
Krumpe et al. (2012) discuss the impact of HOD vs. power-
law models for estimating bias from the correlation function. We
agree that this may contribute to the diﬀerences in halo mass esti-
mates. We further note that the deepest X-ray samples come from
small areas on the sky and suﬀer from poorer statistics and greater
susceptibility to sample variance than the larger area optical stud-
ies. This discrepancy could be well addressed by a large sample of
deep X-ray selected AGN. Ongoing surveys such as eBOSS and
the upcoming eROSITA survey have the opportunity to provide a
homogeneous dataset of quasars up to z(cid:46)2.2. This may allow us to
determine which physical processes drive accretion at diﬀerent red-
shifts and how these processes interact to result in quasar clustering
appearing largely independent of optical luminosity.

8 CONCLUSIONS

We have characterised a new quasar selection for quasars at in-
termediate redshifts 0.8(cid:46)z(cid:46)2.5 and we demonstrate that the WISE
All-Sky data release is complete for quasars in the redshift range
(with g<20.5). To account for photometric incompleteness for
quasars fainter than this limit, to g≈22.5, requires traditional op-
tical selection methods.

The 2QDES pilot survey has shown that a high density quasar
survey is viable with the photometry from VST ATLAS and WISE.
In fact the 2QDESp survey with 4% of the area of SDSS has 20%
more eﬀective volume to detect the BAO peak due to its ≈8× higher
quasar density. But even with 10000 quasars from 2QDESp com-
bined with those from SDSS, 2QZ and 2SLAQ, we still lack a large
enough eﬀective volume to measure the BAO peak in the two-point
correlation function although we gain some advantage in the preci-
sion of the clustering scale length, r0.

Direct comparison between the quasar correlation functions of
SDSS, 2QZ, 2QDESp and 2SLAQ surveys, that range over an order
of magnitude in quasar luminosity, show the same hint of higher r0
at higher (SDSS) luminosities that was seen by Shen et al. (2009)
and S11. However, the errors are such that a luminosity indepen-
dent r0 cannot be rejected by these data.
We combine the clustering measurements from 2QZ, 2SLAQ,
SDSS and 2QDESp in the M − z plane to search further for lu-
minosity and redshift dependence. Contrary to the above hint, we
ﬁnd some tentative evidence here that fainter quasars may be more
strongly clustered than brighter quasars at ﬁxed (high) redshift
(z>1.5), albeit weakly detected. But overall the results remain con-
sistent with a ﬁxed quasar r0 at ﬁxed redshift, independent of lumi-
nosity.

We measure a signiﬁcant redshift dependence of quasar clus-

MNRAS 000, 1–25 (2016)

tering and see that this dependence explains the higher r0 mea-
surements from Eftekharzadeh et al. (2015). Comparison of the
redshift dependence of quasar clustering to the halo model shows
that our data (and that of Eftekharzadeh et al. (2015)) is consistent
with quasars inhabiting 2× 1012M(cid:12) halos irrespective of redshift or
quasar luminosity. These results are usually explained by a ‘ﬂick-
ering’ quasar model with a short duty cycle where quasars over a
wide range of luminosities have similar halo, and hence black hole,
masses. However, such models are inconsistent with the strong cor-
relation between black hole and luminosity found from reverbera-
tion mapping. Shanks et al. (2011) indicated that the quasar cluster-
ing and reverberation mapping results might only be reconciled by
breaking the black hole mass-halo mass correlation, as suggested
by Kormendy & Bender (2011).
We also found similar clustering scale lengths (r0 ≈ 6 h−1Mpc
for quasars in the XMM-COSMOS ﬁeld, with little evidence that
such quasars show a higher clustering amplitude than their more
luminous, optically selected counterparts, as previously reported.
This means that there is less evidence for higher halo masses at low
redshift for AGN accreting in the hot halo mode, as suggested by
Fanidakis et al. (2013).

Figure B1. The normalised covariance matrix (see Equation B2) for ξ(s)
with jackknife errors calculated from dividing our sample into the separate
2dF pointings.

APPENDIX A: DETAILS OF OBSERVATIONS
APPENDIX B: COVARIANCE MATRIX

We calculate the covariance matrix for our full sample, described
in Section 5.2. Using a similar approach of R09, we calculate the
inverse-variance weighted covaraince matrix, Ci j by

(cid:115)

N(cid:88)

L=1

Ci j =

DRL(si)
DR(si)

[ξL(si) − ξtotal(si)]×

(cid:115)

DRL(s j)
DR(s j)

[ξL(s j) − ξtotal(s j)]

(B1)

where DR denotes the number of quasar-random pairs remaining
when we exclude subregion L from the analysis. We recalculate
ξL (see Equation 2) for the remaining sample, after excluding the
speciﬁed region, L. In Figure B1 we present the covariance matrix
for our sample. We normalise the matrix such that

|C| =

Ci j
σiσ j

Table A1. NS tars are the number of point sources brighter than g = 21.5, NQ is the number of spectroscopically conﬁrmed quasars deg−2 in that ﬁeld, S
N is the
mean signal-to-noise per pixel. NQ≤20.5 are the number of spectroscopically conﬁrmed quasars deg−2 in a ﬁeld brighter than g = 20.5. QSOlim is the limit in
g that contains 90% of our quasar sample in that ﬁeld. ulim is the average 5σ limit in u for the stacked images that make up a 2dF ﬁeld.The algorithm speciﬁes
whether we select quasars using the XDQSO algorithm and optical colour selection alone or whether we used WISE photometry as well. Repeated ﬁelds are
ﬁelds that were observed for a second time with new ﬁbre allocations. †5σ u-band limits for SDSS imaging are the characteristic SDSS limits as shown in
Shanks et al. (2015).

Figure C1. We show the quasar sample obtained from each 2dF pointing. The ﬁeld at 11:03:49.48 − 09:05:44.37 was repeated in error. This provided us with
duplicate redshifts for the same quasars. These were analysed to provide redshift error estimates found in Section 5.2.1.
