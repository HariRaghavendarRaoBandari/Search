Negative magnetoresistance (NMR) induced by the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly is regarded as the
most prominent quantum signature of Weyl semimetals when electrical ﬁeld E is collinear with the
external magnetic ﬁeld B. In this article, we report universal NMR in nonmagnetic, centrosymmetric
transition metal dipnictides MPn2 (M=Nb and Ta; Pn=As and Sb), in which the existence of Weyl
fermions can be explicitly excluded. Using temperature-dependent magnetoresistance, Hall and
thermoelectric coeﬃcients of Nernst and Seebeck eﬀects, we determine that the emergence of the
NMR phenomena in MPn2 is coincident with a Lifshitz transition, corresponding to the formation
of unique electron-hole-electron (e-h-e) pockets along the I − L − I(cid:48) direction. First-principles
calculations reveal that, along the I − L− I(cid:48) line, the dxy and dx2−y2 orbitals of the transition metal
form tilted nodal rings of band crossing well below the Fermi level. Strong spin-orbital coupling gaps
all the crossing points and creates the characteristic e-h-e structure, making MPn2 a topological
semimetal with Z2 indices of [0;(111)]. By excluding the weak localization contribution of the bulk
states, we conclude that the universal NMR in MPn2 may have an exotic origin in topological surface
states, which appears in pairs with opposite spin-momentum locking on nontrivial surfaces.

Topological semimetals (TSMs) with strong spin-
orbital coupling have stimulated immense research in-
terests in studying exotic quantum phenomena and
for novel device applications, after the discovery of
symmetry-protected gapless surface states in topologi-
cal insulators1–4. Unlike the conventional band-theory
deﬁnition of metals, the Fermi surface of topological
semimetals can be a Dirac Node, pairs of Weyl nodes
with opposite chirality, 1D nodal ring of Dirac points, or
2D surfaces hosting relativistic quasiparticles of Dirac,
Weyl or Majorana fermions5–11.

Among various TSMs, the theoretical predictions9,10
and experimental veriﬁcations of non-cetrosymmetric
Weyl semimetals (WSMs) of TaAs, TaP, NbAs, and NbP
is considered by many as one of major breakthroughs, be-
cause the quasiparticle excitations in these binary com-
pounds are essentially the long-sought-out chiral Weyl
fermions in theoretical high energy physics12. The spec-
troscopy method of angle resolved photoemission in de-
termining WSM states is straightforward by proving
the existence of Weyl node pairs and the linear dis-
persion of the corresponding WSM bands13–16. How-
ever, transport signatures of WSM states are rather com-
plex for interpretation17–20, and share common features
with Dirac semimetals7,21, such as quasi-linear extremely
large magnetoresistance (XMR) and a non-trivial Berry’s
phase of π22. It thus highlights the importance of observ-
ing the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly23 to conﬁrm the exis-

tence of WSM states. Such chiral anomaly, which man-
ifests as negative magnetoresistance (NMR) when B(cid:107)E,
is ﬁrst predicted for the ultra quantum regime of strong
magnetic ﬁeld, when the Fermi level lies within the ze-
roth Landau level for two opposite-chirality Weyl cones.
Using Boltzmann kinetic equation, Spivak and Andreev
extend the chiral anomaly to the semiclassical regime24,
in which the B2-dependent NMR behaviour dwindles as
a function of 1
T 2

20.

Recently, Zeng et al. predict a new archetype of TSMs
in lanthanum monopnictides LaX (X=P, As, Sb, Bi),
in which SOC opens strong topological bandgap at the
band-crossing points between La d-orbitals and pnicto-
gen py,z-orbitals along the Γ − X lines25. However, the
LaX family is distinct from the known strong topologi-
cal insulators (STIs)1–4 with the Fermi level well above
the STI bandgap. This peculiar conﬁguration leads to
the coexistence of large trivial e-h pockets and helical
Dirac surface states, in which the presence of the latter
protected by the STI topological invariant ν0 = 1. Trans-
port measurements of LaSb exhibit extraordinary XMR
of nearly one million at 2 K and 9 T, which has been at-
tributed to the topological surface states in the limit of
broken time reversal symmetry induced by the external
ﬁeld26.

In the present study, we report universal NMR phe-
nomena in monoclinic transition metal dipnictides MPn2,
which represent another archetypal TSMs with the co-
existence of large trivial pockets with non-trivial weak
topological variants in the bulk. Direct comparisons be-
tween three types of high-quality singlecrystals of NbAs2,
TaAs2 and TaSb2 shed light on the physical origin of the

exotic NMR phenomena. Using ﬁrst-principles calcula-
tions and quantum oscillations, we ﬁnd that indepen-
dent of the SOC magnitudes and lattice constants, all
three compounds share the common feature of unique
e-h-e pockets along the I − L− I(cid:48) direction, which is cre-
ated by weak topological bandgap opening of tilted nodal
rings of the crossing M-dxy and M-dx2−y2 orbitals. Us-
ing temperature-dependent magnetoresistance, Hall and
thermoelectric coeﬃcients of Nernst and Seebeck eﬀects,
we found that the vanishing temperature of NMR is
agreeing with a Lifshitz transition, when the hole pocket
of the e-h-e structure disappears. In contrast, the bulk
trivial pocket compensation is not correlated to the NMR
phenomena, although it determines the magnitude and
saturation behaviour of the XMR characteristics. No-
ticeably, the bulk Z2 indices of [ν0 = 0; ν = (111)] in
MPn2 require Dirac surface states to appear in pair with
the opposite helical spin structures. With B(cid:107)E, the two
surface Dirac cones with opposite spin-momentum lock-
ing may be exchanging helical quasiparticles, creating an
extra surface conduction channel in analogy to the chiral
anomaly in bulk WSMs.

RESULTS

As shown in Figure 1, the MPn2 family shares the
common monoclinic structure with the centrosymmetric
space group of C12/m1 (No.12) [see Fig. 1(a); here we
use NbAs2 as an example]. As illustrated in Fig. 1(b),
NbAs2 crystals form one-dimensional chains of Nb and
As respectively along the b axis, which is the fast crys-
tal growth direction. The as-grown single crystals are
needle shaped with well-deﬁned facets, among which the
(001) plane is most distinguishable as the largest surface
facet [see Supplementary Information (SI)]. As shown in
Fig. 1(c), powder XRD of NbAs2 at 15 K and 300 K indi-
cates that except decrease in the lattice constants, there
is no structural phase transition. Fig. 1(d) show the ﬁrst
Brillouin zone of MPn2, in which the Band calculation
path and the important symmetry points have been in-
dicated by the red line and solid blue circles, respectively.
Noticeably, the residual resistivity ratio (RRR), which
is a direct indication of single-crystal quality, is signiﬁ-
cantly lower in NbAs2 and TaAs2 (RRR< 100) than in
TaSb2 (> 500). The discrepancy may be due to the for-
mation of As-vacancies in the former two compounds.
Such As-vacancies will introduce sample-dependent elec-
tron doping27, as we will discuss in details in the quantum
oscillation results. The monoclinic lattice of the MPn2
family also produces highly anisotropic Fermi surfaces,
which is very sensitive to the orientation of the magnetic
ﬁeld. These two factors may explain the contradicting re-
sults of SdH oscillations in TaAs2 reported very recently
by diﬀerent groups28–30. Nevertheless, we will show that
the NMR phenomena are readily observed independent
of the sample quality, a manifestation of its origin in the
topological surface states. It also highlights the impor-

2

tance of observing NMR in TaSb2, which has nearly per-
fect compensation with less than 0.1% mismatch between
the e and h populations31, as an example of intrinsic
MPn2.

Before we present the NMR results, it is critical to un-
derstand the electronic structure of NbAs2, TaAs2 and
TaSb2 respectively, using the ﬁrst principle DFT cal-
culations. As summarized in Figure 2, independent of
the SOC magnitude and variations in lattice constants, a
general feature of the MPn2 family is unique electron-
hole-electron (e-h-e) pockets along the I − L − I(cid:48) di-
rection. Detailed analysis of the valence and conduc-
tion bands indicates that the Fermi surface of MPn2 is
mainly contributed by the d-orbitals of the transition
metal. When SOC is not included, the M-dxy and M-
dx2−y2 orbitals form a tilted nodal ring of band crossing
along the I − L − I(cid:48) line31. Once SOC is turned on,
the band crossing points are completely gapped, creating
the characteristic e-h-e pockets. For NbAs2, the three
pockets in the e-h-e structure are very close in the mo-
mentum space, which can be better visualized by plotting
the three-dimensional (3D) Fermi surface in the ﬁrst Bril-
louin zone (Fig. 2a and 2d). The stronger SOC in TaAs2
increases the separation between the e-h-e pockets, and
the main hole pocket extends noticeably along the L− F
direction (Fig. 2b and 2e). In both NbAs2 and TaAs2,
the dominant e-h-e pockets are coexisting with four small
hole pockets and two small electron pockets, all located
at the boundary of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone along the [001]
axis (Fig. 2d and 2e). For TaSb2, there are drastic
changes in the band structures. As shown in Fig. 2c and
2f, the main hole pocket in NbAs2 and TaAs2 becomes
a small shoulder pocket, while the two e pockets created
by SOC in the e-h-e structures are much enlarged. It is
also distinct that the four small hole pockets in NbAs2
and TaAs2 merges into a single large pocket with dou-
ble saddleback geometry31. As rooted in the monoclinic
lattice, the bandgap opening for the formation of the e-
h-e structure is non-trivial with Z2 topological invariants
[ν0; (ν1ν2ν3)] being [0;(111)], as shown in the parity table
of the eight TRIM points (Table I). The coexistence of
non-trivial Z2 invariants and large trivial pockets make
MPn2 a unique topological semimetal, as we shown in
the following sections.

magnetic susceptibility (dHvA). As shown in Figure 3a
and 3b,
it is not straightforward to using the base-
temperature SdH alone to determine the physical ori-
gin of diﬀerent quantum oscillation frequencies, due to
the existence of harmonic peaks and possible magnetic
breakdown. Temperature increase eﬀectively suppresses
the secondary peaks, but the intrinsic frequencies remain
robust in the MR curves. For NbAs2, the fast Fourier
transform (FFT) of the MR curve at 7.2 K only shows
three oscillation peaks of 109.6 T, 234.3 T and 270.5 T re-
spectively, while all high frequency peaks at 1.5 K above
400 T disappear. Such diﬀerentiation of intrinsic and sec-
ondary peaks has been crosschecked by the dHvA tech-
nique, which is free of the side eﬀects and probes the
quantization of intrinsic carrier pockets (see SI). Com-
bining these two complementary methods, we conﬁrm
the existence of e-h-e structure in each compound by as-
signing the corresponding oscillation frequencies in the
MR curves.

For TaSb2, the DFT results agree with the experiments
very well by predicting the existence of three oscillation
frequencies of α, β, and γ for the hole and electron pock-
ets in the e-h-e structure and a trivial saddleback-shaped
hole pocket, respectively31. For NbAs2, there are surpris-
ingly also three prominent frequencies, while the DFT
calculations predict at least four trivial pockets (Fig. 2a).
The unusually strong 2γ peak, which is an indication of
magnetic breakdown, is also not consistent with the DFT
results, suggesting well isolated carrier pockets (Fig. 2b).
Using angle-dependent SdH, we have determined that
the β peak is the electron pocket in the e-h-e structure,
distinct from others by a ∼ 40◦ tilted angle from the c
axis (See SI). By measuring multiple samples, we found
that the changes in α is always opposite to β, whereas
β increases or decreases simultaneously with γ (Fig. 3c).
This is partly due to the highly anisotropic Fermi surface,
and more importantly, an indication of sample-dependent
electron doping in NbAs2. As shown in Fig. 2a, the Fermi

level of intrinsic NbAs2 is extremely close to the band top
of the trivial hole pocket along the X1− Y line, which is
vulnerable to electron doping induced by As-vacancies.
Such sample-dependent self doping also brings the elec-
tron pocket pair along the I1−Z−I1(cid:48) line much closer in
k-space, which can explain the unusual 2γ peak intensity.

Similar to NbAs2, TaAs2 also shows three predomi-
nant quantum oscillation peaks, corresponding to the e-
h-e structure (α for the hole and β for the electron) and
the electron pocket pairs in the vicinity of Z (γ in Fig.
3b). After zoom-in, a shoulder peak of α(cid:48) can be found,
which is nearly superimposed with α. This extra peak
may be correlated to the two extra pairs of hole pockets
in the vicinity of the F 1 and F 1(cid:48) points. T-dependent
Nernst eﬀect (Sxy) of NbAs2 and TaAs2 indicate that
both compounds are not intrinsic semimetals, evident by
non linearity in Sxy even at the base temperature, while
TaSb2 has nearly perfect linear Sxy persisting up to 47 K
(Fig. 3d-e and SI). The intrinsic semimetal of TaSb2 is
also manifested in Hall signals (ρxy), which is “U”-shaped
at 1.5 K, while NbAs2 and TaAs2 have the parabolic-like
ρxy with negative coeﬃcients, due to signiﬁcantly more e
population. It is also interesting to notice that the mag-
nitude of ρxy at 9 T and 1.5 K in TaSb2 is one order of
magnitude smaller than TaAs2 (10 µΩ · cm for TaSb2 vs
100 µΩ · cm for TaAs2), as a result of perfect compen-
sation in TaSb2. The non-intrinsic doping in NbAs2 and
TaAs2 also changes the XMR characteristics ρxy, which
becomes saturating once B exceeds 8 T (See SI). For in-
trinsic TaSb2, the quadratic growth of ¯µBm is strictly

kept up to 15 T31.

Independent of the sample quality, NMR has been
readily observed in all samples of NbAs2, TaAs2 and
TaSb2 at low temperatures when B is collinear with E.
As shown in Figure 4a-4c, a distinct feature below 1 T is
a rapid growth of positive MR. Such sharp MR increase
is mainly attributed to the weak antilocalizaiton (WAL)
eﬀect, while the XMR eﬀect induced by non perfectly
aligned B and E only contributes a small part (See SI).
The negative MR growth followed the positive MR cusp
is non saturating in NbAs2 and TaAs2, which exceeds -
60% at 1.5 K and 15 T. For TaSb2, NMR quickly reaches
-50% at 1.5 K and 2 T, then shows an upturn when the
XMR signals become dominant at high ﬁelds. Such MR
upturn is testimony of the high quality of our TaSb2 crys-
tals, which has large than 300% MR even with a small
eﬀective B⊥ of 0.08 T (estimated by 0.2◦ misalignment)
at 1.5 K. Indeed, for low quality samples in which RRR
is nearly an order of magnitude lower, the XMR uptown
is not present even at 9 T32.

It is also notable that both the low-T WAL-associated
positive MR and the NMR show distinct B dependence
when crossing a critical temperature. For NbAs2, the
WAL eﬀect becomes much broader and weaker in mag-
nitude at ∼ 50 K (Fig. 4a). In contrast, such T crossing
points are ∼ 30 K and ∼ 20 K for TaAs2 and TaSb2
respectively (Fig. 4b and 4c). The transition is most
drastic in intrinsic TaSb2. Below 20 K, the WAL-induced
MR is extremely narrow within 0.5 T, above which rapid
NMR growth dominates. In contrast, at 30 K, the WAL

FFT frequencies. (d) - (f) T-dependent Nernst eﬀects of NbAs2, TaAs2 and TaSb2. The perfect linearity of Sxy in TaSb2 from
1.5 K to 47.5 K is a manifestation of nearly ideal e-h compensation (< 0.1% mismatch). Such behavior is in contrast to the
non-intrinsic NbAs2, TaAs2, showing signiﬁcant sample-dependent electron doping, probably due to the electron doping from
As vacancy donors. .

eﬀect is largely extended to 2 T, but with a much smaller
slope. Although NMR becomes non saturating at 30 K,
its magnitude at 10 T is nearly halved compared to the
result at 1.5 K, despite that B is ﬁve times smaller in the
latter. The observations suggest that across the critical
temperature, both WAL and NMR in MPn2 may have
diﬀerent physical origins. Intriguingly, 20 K is one of the
two Lifshitz transition temperatures in TaSb2, which cor-
responds to the vanishing of the hole shoulder pocket in
the e-h-e structure (See Fig. 4f and detailed discussion in
Ref.31). Inspired by this ﬁnding, we have also measured
the T-dependent Seebeck coeﬃcient Sxx of NbAs2 and
TaAs2, in which Lifshitz transitions are the slope change
points in dSxx/dT 33. As shown in Fig. 4d and 4e, the
determined Lifshitz transition temperature is 65 K and
55 K for NbAs2 and TaAs2 respectively. The Sxx de-
duced Lifshitz temperatures for three binary compounds
are qualitatively agreeing with the transition tempera-
tures between WAL and NMR, and both are consistent
with the DFT prediction of reducing hole pocket size in
the e-h-e structure from NbAs2, TaAs2 to TaSb2.

Although our results suggest a strong correlation be-
tween the e-h-e structure and the anomalous MR in
MPn2 with B (cid:107) E, it is unlikely that the WAL and NMR
phenomena are mainly contributed by the trivial pock-
ets. For trivial spin-polarized pockets in strong SOC sys-
tems, collinear B and E can induce a smooth crossover

from positive MR to negative MR due to the competition
between WAL and weak localization (WL)34, which can
be modelled by

(cid:52)R = −a1 ln(1 + b1B2L2

so) + a2 ln(1 + b1B2L2

ϕ).

(1)

Here Lso and Lϕ are the spin ﬂipping length and the
phase coherent length respectively, and a1, a2, b1 are
constant parameters. The broad crossover from positive
to negative MR lies in the fact that WL has a larger
coeﬃcient of a1 but a smaller growth parameter of Lso,
compared a2 and Lϕ in WAL respectively. As an intrinsic
parameter of SOC in the bulk, Lso is less sensitive to tem-
perature than Lϕ, leading to pronounced T-dependent
crossover characteristics. Such simpliﬁed model can ex-
plain the evolution of anomalous MR curves of TaSb2
above the Lifshitz transition, but it fails to capture the
parabolic-like NMR growth below 30 K unless Lso is un-
realistically increased by several order of magnitudes (See
SI).

By excluding WL of bulk states as the main mech-
anism, we propose an exotic explanation of topological
surface state originated NMR. Due to the unique Z2 in-
dices of [0;(111)], most surfaces in MPn2 are topologically
nontrivial with the presence of massless surface states,

Due to the weak TI nature, Dirac surface states must
appear in pair with the opposite helical spin structures.
With collinear B and E, the left-handed and right-handed
surface Dirac cones may be exchanging helical quasipar-
ticles, creating an extra surface conduction channel in
analogy to the chiral anomaly in bulk WSMs. The exis-
tence of massless surface states in MPn2 can also explain
the low-temperature plateau in resistivity vs T charac-
teristics when B is turned on (See SI and Ref.32).

observed in MPn2 present in this study may be a man-
ifestation of the rich physics for such topological weak
TI surfaces. However, the e-h-e structure in MPn2 is
so dominant that it is very challenging to diﬀerentiate
the the intrinsic topological surface states from the bulk
states. It would be interesting to search for other com-
pounds with the same C12/m1 lattice for weak TI stud-
ies. For TaSb2, pressure and chemical doping may be able
to tune the SOC magnitude and thus suppress the e-h-e
structure eﬀectively, so that the intrinsic weak TI sur-
faces can be probed by various experimental techniques.

METHODS

DISCUSSION

Like the recent reported LaSb, the MPn2 family rep-
resents a new class of topological semimetals, with the
coexistence of non-trivial topological invariants and large
trivial compensated pockets. Unlike LaSb, in which SOC
opens a direct topological bandgap, the gapping of the
d-orbital crossing in MPn2 leads to the formation of
large trivial pockets with the e-h-e structure. The Z2
of [0;(111)] of MPn2 make this series a unique platform
to study various theoretical proposals for weak TIs, in
which the topological surface states must appear in pairs
with opposite helical spin textures. The universal NMR

Single crystals of NbAs2 and TaAs2 and TaSb2 were
synthesized by two-step vapor transport technique us-
ing iodine as the transport agent. Polycrystalline sam-
ples were ﬁrst prepared by solid state reaction in evac-
uated quartz tubes with stoichiometric mixture of tran-
sition metal [Nb (99.99%) or Ta (99.99%)] and pnictide
[As (99.5%) or Sb (99.999%)]. Subsequently, the poly-
crystalline pellets were ground thoroughly and mixed
with iodine (∼13 mg/ml in concentration), before be-
ing reloaded into quartz ampoules. The single crystals of
TaAs2 and NbAs2 were grown in a temperature gradient
of ∆T = 950 − 1000◦C for seven days. The two-zone

The single crystal and powder X-ray diﬀraction (XRD)
data were collected by a PANalytical X-ray diﬀractome-
ter (Empyrean) with a Cu Kα radiation and a graphite
monochromator. The rocking curve of the (001) plane
is characterized by the dominant (003) peak, which has
a very narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
0.06◦ (See SI). The powder XRD diﬀraction of NbAs2
can be well reﬁned using the Rietveld method, yield-
ing lattice parameters of a=9.3556(0) ˚A, b=3.3821(3) ˚A,
and c=7.7967(2) ˚A, respectively (See SI for the XRD
results of TaAs2 and TaSb2). The chemical composi-
tions of three diﬀerent types of single crystals were deter-
mined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).
The stoichiometry of three compounds are Nb:As=1:1.98,
Ta:As=1:2.08 and Ta:Sb=1:2 respectively, showing no
trace of iodine residual or other contaminations. The
Rietveld reﬁnement of the powder XRD data was anal-
ysed by the software Rietan-FP35. Electric and ther-
moelectric transport measurements were performed on
a Quantum Design physical property measurement sys-

7

tem (PPMS-9T) and an Oxford-15T cryostat with a He-
4 probe. Without speciﬁc mentioned, the magnetic ﬁeld
was applied along the c axis, i.e. the [001] direction, and
the current or temperature gradient was applied along
the b axis. The thermoelectric properties were measured
by the steady-state technique. The typical temperature
gradient used in the experiments is about 0.5 K/mm,
which is determined by the diﬀerential method using a
pair of type-E thermocouples.

The ﬁrst principles density-functional theory (DFT)
calculations were done with the Vienna ab initio simula-
tion package (VASP)36,37, using the projector augmented
wave method38. The generalized gradient approximation
(GGA)39 was used to introduce the exchange-correlation
potential as well as spin-orbit coupling. By setting the
plane-wave cutoﬀ energy to be 400 eV and performing k-
point sampling based on the Monkhorst-Pack scheme40,
the total energy is ensured to be converged within 0.002
eV per unitcell. The structures were optimized until the
remanent Hellmann-Feynman force on each ion is less
than 0.01 eV/˚A. For a comparative study, we used lat-
tice parameters extracted from the XRD results for the
DFT calculations.
