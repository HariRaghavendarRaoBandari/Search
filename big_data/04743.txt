Asymptotic Expansions

for Stationary Distributions of

Nonlinearly Perturbed Semi-Markov Processes. II

Dmitrii Silvestrov1 and Sergei Silvestrov2

Abstract: Asymptotic expansions with explicit upper bounds for remain-
ders are given for stationary distributions of nonlinearly perturbed semi-
Markov processes with ﬁnite phase spaces. The corresponding algorithms
are based on a special technique of sequential phase space reduction, which
can be applied to processes with an arbitrary asymptotic communicative
structure of phase spaces.

Keywords: Markov chain; semi-Markov process; nonlinear perturbation;
stationary distribution; expected hitting time; Laurent asymptotic expansion

1. Introduction

In this paper, we present new algorithms for construction of asymptotic
expansions for stationary distributions of nonlinearly perturbed semi-Markov
processes with a ﬁnite phase space. This is Part II of the paper, Silvestrov,
D. and Silvestrov, S. (2016), where algorithms for constructing of asymptotic
expansions with remainders of a standard form o(·) have been given. In Part
II, we present algorithms for construction asymptotic expansions of a more
advanced form, with explicit upper bounds for remainders.

We consider models, where the phase space is one class of communicative
states, for embedded Markov chains of pre-limiting perturbed semi-Markov
processes, while it can possess an arbitrary communicative structure, i.e., can

consist of one or several closed classes of communicative states and, possibly,
a class of transient states, for the limiting embedded Markov chain.

The initial perturbation conditions are formulated in the forms of Taylor
and Laurent asymptotic expansions with explicit upper bounds for remain-
ders, respectively, for transition probabilities (of embedded Markov chains)
and expectations of sojourn times, for perturbed semi-Markov processes.

The algorithms are based on special time-space screening procedures for
sequential phase space reduction and algorithms for re-calculation of asymp-
totic expansions with explicit upper bounds for remainders, which constitute
perturbation conditions for the semi-Markov processes with reduced phase
spaces.

The ﬁnal asymptotic expansions for stationary distributions of nonlin-
early perturbed semi-Markov processes are given in the form of Taylor asymp-
totic expansions, with explicit upper bounds for remainders.

The algorithms presented in the paper have an universal character. They
can be applied to perturbed semi-Markov processes with an arbitrary asymp-
totic communicative structure and are computationally eﬀective due to re-
current character of computational procedures.

The survey of works in the area and detailed comments concerned with

the proposed method are given in the Introduction to Part I of this paper.

Here, we would like, only, to mention books, which contains parts de-
voted to perturbed Markov chains and semi-Markov processes, and problems
related to asymptotic expansions for the above models. These are, Korolyuk
and Turbin (1976, 1978), Courtois (1977), Seneta (1981, 2006), Stewart and
Sun (1990), Kartashov (1996), Stewart (1998, 2001), Yin and Zhang (1998,
2005, 2013), Korolyuk, V.S. and Korolyuk, V.V. (1999), Konstantinov, Gu,
Mehrmann and Petkov (2003), Bini, Latouche and Meini (2005), Korolyuk
and Limnios (2005), Gyllenberg and Silvestrov (2008), and Avrachenkov,
Filar and Howlett (2013).

A comprehensive bibliography of works in the area can be found in these
books and, also, in the research report by Silvestrov, D. and Silvestrov, S.
(2015), which is an extended preliminary version of the present paper.

In conclusion, we would like to mention that, by our opinion, the results
presented in the paper have a good potential for continuation of studies. We
comment some prospective directions for future studies in the last section of
the paper.

Part II includes four sections and two appendices. In Section 2, we present
so-called operational rules for Laurent asymptotic expansions with explicit

upper bounds for remainders. In Section 3, we present basic perturbation
conditions and algorithms for construction of asymptotic expansions with
explicit upper bounds for remainders, for transition characteristics of non-
linearly perturbed semi-Markov processes with reduced phase spaces.
In
Section 4, we present algorithms for construction of asymptotic expansions
with explicit upper bounds for remainders, for expected hitting times for non-
linearly perturbed semi-Markov processes. In Section 5, we present an algo-
rithm for construction of asymptotic expansions with explicit upper bounds
for remainders, for stationary distributions of nonlinearly perturbed semi-
Markov processes.
In Appendix A, we give proofs of lemmas representing
operational rules for Laurent asymptotic expansions without and with ex-
plicit upper bounds for remainders. In Appendix B, we discuss and present
examples illustrating algorithms for construction of asymptotic expansions
for stationary distributions of nonlinearly perturbed semi-Markov processes
developed in the present paper.

2. Laurent asymptotic expansions with explicit upper bounds

for remainders

In this section, we present so-called operational rules for Laurent asymp-
totic expansions with explicit upper bounds for remainders. The correspond-
ing proofs and comments are given in Appendix A.

Let A(ε) be a real-valued function deﬁned on an interval (0, ε0], for some

0 < ε0 ≤ 1, and given on this interval by a Laurent asymptotic expansion,

A(ε) = ahAεhA + · · · + akAεkA + oA(εkA),

(1)

where (a) −∞ < hA ≤ kA < ∞ are integers, (b) coeﬃcients ahA, . . . , akA
are real numbers, (c) |oA(εkA)| ≤ GAεkA+δA, for 0 < ε ≤ εA, where (d)
0 < δA ≤ 1, 0 < GA < ∞ and 0 < εA ≤ ε0.

We refer to such Laurent asymptotic expansion as a (hA, kA, δA, GA, εA)-

expansion.

The (hA, kA, δA, GA, εA)-expansion is also a (hA, kA)-expansion, according
the deﬁnition given in Part I of the paper, since, oA(εkA)/εkA → 0 as ε → 0.
We say that (hA, kA, δA, GA, εA)-expansion A(ε) is pivotal if it is known

that ahA 6= 0.

It is useful to note that there is no sense to consider, it seems, a more
general case of upper bounds for the remainder oA(εkA), with parameter δA >

3

A = kA+[δA]−I(δA = [δA]) and δ′

1. Indeed, let us deﬁne k′
A = δA−[δA]+I(δA =
[δA]) ∈ (0, 1]. The (hA, kA, δA, GA, εA)-expansion A(ε) can be re-written in
A, GA, εA)-expansion, A(ε) = ahAεhA +
A, δ′
the equivalent form of the (hA, k′

A), with the remainder o′

A(εk′

oA(εkA), which satisﬁes inequalities |o′
GAεk′

A, for 0 < ε ≤ εA.

A(εk′

A+δ′

The above remarks imply that the asymptotic expansion A(ε) can be
represented in diﬀerent forms. In such cases, we consider forms with larger
parameters hA and kA as more informative. As far as parameters δA, GA and
εA are concerned, we consider as more informative forms, ﬁrst, with larger
values of parameter δA, second, with smaller values of parameter GA and,
third, with larger values of parameter εA.

are indexed by symbol ∗.

It is also useful to mention that a constant a can be interpreted as function
A(ε) ≡ a. Thus, 0 can be represented, for any integer −∞ < h ≤ k < ∞, as
the (h, k, δh,k, Gh,k, εh,k)-expansion, 0 = 0εh+. . .+0εk+o(εk), with remainder
o(εk) ≡ 0 and, thus, parameters δh,k = 1, an arbitrary small Gh,k ∈ (0, ∞),
and εh,k = ε0. Also, 1 can be represented, for any integer 0 ≤ k < ∞, as
the (0, k, δk, Gk, εk)-expansion, 1 = 1 + 0ε + . . . + 0εk + o(εk), with remainder
o(εk) ≡ 0 and, thus, parameters δk = 1, an arbitrary small Gk ∈ (0, ∞), and
εk = ε0.

Let us consider four Laurent asymptotic expansions, A(ε) = ahAεhA +
· · · + akAεkA + oA(εkA), B(ε) = bhB εhB + · · · + bkB εkB + oB(εkB), C(ε) =

4

chC εhC + · · · + ckC εkC + oC(εkC ), and D(ε) = dhDεhD + · · · + dkD εkD + oD(εkD)
deﬁned for 0 < ε ≤ ε0, for some 0 < ε0 ≤ 1.

The following Lemma presents operational rules for computing parame-

ters of upper bounds for remainders of Laurent asymptotic expansions.

Lemma 2. The above asymptotic expansions have the following opera-

tional rules for computing remainders:

(i) If A(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a (hA, kA, δA, GA, εA)-expansion and c is a con-
stant, then C(ε) = cA(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a (hC, kC, δC, GC, εC)-expansion with
parameters hC, kC and coeﬃcients cr, r = hC, . . . , kC given in proposition (i)
of Lemma 2∗, and parameters δC, GC and εC given by the formulas:

(a) δC = δA;
(b) GC = |c|GA;
(c) εC = εA.
(ii) If A(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a (hA, kA, δA, GA, εA)-expansion and B(ε), ε ∈

powers in all terms penetrating the sums, which deﬁne parameters GC, GD
and ˜εB, in Lemma 2.

The following operational rules for computing remainders for multiple
summation and multiplication of Laurent asymptotic expansions, used in
what follows, are analogues of the corresponding summation and multiplica-
tion rules given in Lemma 2.

case:

(i) Bn(ε) = A1(ε) + · · · + An(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is, for every n = 1, . . . , N , a

spect to any permutation, respectively, of summation and multiplication order
in the above formulas.

The summation and multiplication rules for computing of upper bounds
for remainders given in propositions (ii) and (iii) of Lemma 2 possess the
communicative property, but do not possess the associative and distributional
properties.

Lemma 2 let us get an eﬀective low bound for parameter δA for any
(hA, kA, δA, GA, εA)-expansion A(ε) obtained as the result of a ﬁnite sequence
of operations (described in Lemma 2) performed over expansions from some
ﬁnite set of such expansions.

The following lemma summarize these properties of Laurent asymptotic

expansions with explicit upper bounds for remainders.

Lemma 4. The summation and multiplication operations for Laurent
asymptotic expansions deﬁned in Lemma 2 possess the following algebraic
properties, which should be understood as equalities for the corresponding
parameters of upper bounds for their remainders:

(i) The functional identity, C(ε) ≡ A(ε) + B(ε) ≡ B(ε) + A(ε), implies

that δC = δA+B = δB+A, GC = GA+B = GB+A and εC = εA+B = εB+A.

(ii) The functional identity, C(ε) ≡ A(ε) · B(ε) ≡ B(ε) · A(ε), implies

that δC = δA·B = δB·A, GC = GA·B = GB·A and εC = εA·B = εB·A.

(iii) If A(ε) is (hA, kA, δA, GA, εA)-expansion obtained as the result of a
ﬁnite sequence of operations (multiplication by a constant, summation, mul-
tiplication, and division) performed over (hAi, kAi, δAi, GAi, εAi)-expansions
Ai(ε), i = 1, . . . , N , according the rules presented in Lemmas 2∗ and 2, then
δA ≥ δ∗
N = min1≤i≤N δAi. This makes it possible to rewrite A(ε) as the
(hA, kA, δ∗

3. Asymptotic expansions for transition characteristics of non-
linearly perturbed semi-Markov processes with reduced phase
spaces

Let us recall the perturbed semi-Markov processes η(ε)(t), t ≥ 0, with
phase space X = {1, . . . , N} and transition probabilities Q(ε)
ij (t), t ≥ 0, i, j ∈
X, introduced in Part I of the paper. These processes depend on a pertur-
bation parameter ε ∈ (0, ε0], for some 0 < ε0 ≤ 1. We also recall transi-
tion probabilities of the corresponding embedded Markov chains, pij(ε) =
ij (∞), i, j ∈ X, and expectations of sojourn times eij(ε) = R ∞
Q(ε)
ij (dt),
i, j ∈ X.

We assume that condition A, introduced in Part I, holds for semi-Markov
processes η(ε)(t). In particular, we recall the transition sets Yi, i ∈ X (which
include states j ∈ X with non-zero probabilities pij(ε) and guarantee ergod-
icity of the processes η(ε)(t)) introduced in this condition.

However, we replace the perturbation condition D by the following stronger
condition, in which the corresponding Taylor asymptotic expansions are given
in the form with explicit upper bounds for remainders:

As was pointed out in Part I, condition A implies that sets Y+

rr = Yrr \
{r} 6= ∅, r ∈ X and the non-absorption probability ¯prr(ε) = 1−prr(ε) ∈ (0, 1],
for r ∈ X, ε ∈ (0, ε0]. This probability satisfy the following relation, for every
r ∈ X, ε ∈ (0, ε0],

¯prr(ε) = 1 − prr(ε) = X

prj(ε).

The above relation let us construct an algorithm for getting asymptotic
expansions with explicit upper bounds for remainders, for non-absorption
probabilities ¯prr(ε).

rr, ¯l+

Lemma 5. Let conditions A and D′ hold. Then, for every r ∈ X, the
pivotal (¯l−
rr)-expansion for the non-absorption probability ¯prr(ε) given in
Lemma 8∗ is, also, a (¯l−
rr, ¯δrr, ¯Grr, ¯εrr)-expansion, with parameters ¯δrr, ¯Grr
and ¯εrr, which can be computed according the algorithm described below, in
the proof of the lemma.

rr, ¯l+

Proof. Let r ∈ Yr. First, propositions (i) of Lemmas 3∗ and 3 (the mul-
tiple summation rule) should be applied to the sum Pj∈Y+

initial semi-Markov process. Let us exclude state ri,1 from the phase space
of semi-Markov process ¯ri,0η(ε)(t) using the time-space screening procedure
described in Section 5∗. Let ¯ri,1η(ε)(t) be the corresponding reduced semi-
Markov process. The above procedure can be repeated. The state ri,2 can
be excluded from the phase space of the semi-Markov process ¯ri,1η(ε)(t). Let
¯ri,2η(ε)(t) be the corresponding reduced semi-Markov process. By continuing
the above procedure for states ri,3, . . . , ri,n, we construct the reduced semi-
Markov process ¯ri,nη(ε)(t).

The process ¯ri,nη(ε)(t) has the phase space ¯ri,n
X = X \ {ri,1, ri,2, . . . , ri,n}.
The transition probabilities ¯ri,npi′j′(ε), i′, j′ ∈ ¯ri,n
X and the expectations of
sojourn times ¯ri,nei′j′(ε), i′, j′ ∈ ¯ri,n
X are determined for the process ¯ri,nη(ε)(t)
by the transition probabilities and the expectations of sojourn times for the
process ¯ri,n−1η(ε)(t), via relations (3) and (5).

By Theorem 1∗, the expectation of hitting time Ei′j′(ε) coincides for the
semi-Markov processes ¯ri,0η(ε)(t), ¯ri,1η(ε)(t), . . ., ¯ri,nη(ε)(t), for every i′, j′ ∈

By Theorems 2∗, 3∗, 1 and 2, the semi-Markov processes ¯ri,nη(ε)(t) satisfy
conditions A – C, D′ and E′. The transition sets ¯ri,n

process ¯ri,nη(ε)(t), are determined by the transition sets ¯ri,n−1

The algorithm described above has a recurrent form and should be re-

alized sequentially for the reduced semi-Markov processes
¯ri,nη(ε)(t) starting from the initial semi-Markov process ¯ri,0η(ε)(t).

Let us take n = N − 1. The semi-Markov process ¯ri,N −1η(ε)(t) has
X = X \ {ri,1, ri,2, . . . , ri,N −1} = {i}, which is a one-

transition probability ¯ri,N −1pii(ε) = 1, and the expectation of hitting time,
Eii(ε) = ¯ri,N −1eii(ε). This equality and Theorem 4∗ yield, for every i ∈ X, the
pivotal (M −

It is worth to note that the algorithms based on sequential exclusion of
states from the phase space of perturbed semi-Markov processes make it
possible to get Laurent asymptotic expansions (without and with explicit
upper bounds for remainders) for expected hitting times, for nonlinearly
perturbed semi-Markov processes. Such asymptotic results have their own
important value.

Let ¯ri,j,N = hri,j,1, . . . , ri,j,Ni = hri,j,1, . . . , ri,j,N −2, i, ji be a permuta-
tion of the sequence h1, . . . , Ni such that ri,j,N −1 = i, ri,j,N = j, and let
¯ri,j,n = hri,j,1, . . . , ri,j,ni, n = 1, . . . , N be the corresponding chain of growing
sequences of states from space X.

By applying the algorithm of sequential phase space reduction described
in Theorem 4 to the above sequence of states ¯ri,j,N −2, we construct the re-
duced semi-Markov process ¯ri,j,N −2η(ε)(t). This process has the phase space
X = Xij = {i, j}, which is a two-states set. The transition probabili-

Yi′ = Yij,i′, i′ ∈ Xij can be found using the recurrent
transition sets ¯ri,j,N −2
algorithm described in Theorem 4∗. These probabilities, expectations and
transition sets are invariant to any permutation ¯r′
i,j,N −2 of sequence ¯ri,j,N −2.
This legitimates the above alternative simpliﬁed notations.

Theorem 4∗ let us construct the pivotal (l−

tations are also invariant to any permutation ¯r′

i,j,N −2 of sequence ¯ri,j,N −2.

It is easy to write down the formulas for the above expectations, for the
two-states semi-Markov process ¯ri,j,N −2η(ε)(t). These formulas are, Ei′j′(ε) =

corresponding algorithm, for every i ∈ X.

The following theorem is the main new result in Part II of this paper.
Theorem 4. Let conditions A – C, D′ and E′ hold for the semi-

The explicit upper bounds for remainders in the asymptotic expansions
given in Theorem 4 have a clear and informative power-type form. An useful
property of these upper bounds is that they are uniform with respect to the
perturbation parameter. The recurrent algorithm for ﬁnding these upper
bounds is computationally eﬀective.

Unfortunately, the summation and multiplication operational rules for
computing power-type upper bounds for remainders possess commutative
but do not possess associative and distributive properties. This causes de-
pendence of the resulting upper bounds for remainders in the asymptotic
expansions for stationary probabilities πi(ε), i ∈ X on a choice of the cor-
responding sequences of states ¯ri,N −1 = hri,1, . . . , ri,N −1i, i ∈ X used in the
above algorithm. This rises two open questions, the ﬁrst one, about possible
alternative forms for remainders possessing the desirable algebraic properties
mentioned above, and, the second one, about an optimal choice of sequences
of states ¯ri,N −1, i ∈ X.

In conclusion, we would like to mention some prospective directions for

future research studies.

The method of sequential reduction of phase space presented in the paper
can be applied for getting asymptotic expansions for high order power and
exponential moments of hitting times, for nonlinearly perturbed semi-Markov
processes. This is an interesting problem, which has its own important the-
oretical and applied values.

We are quite sure that a combination of results in the above direction
with the methods of asymptotic analysis for nonlinearly perturbed regener-
ative processes developed and throughly presented in Gyllenberg and Silve-
strov (2008) will make it possible to expand results from this book, related
to asymptotic expansions for stationary and more general quasi-stationary
distributions as well as other characteristics for nonlinearly perturbed semi-

17

Markov processes with absorption, to nonlinearly perturbed semi-Markov
processes with an arbitrary asymptotic communicative structure of phase
spaces.

The problems of aggregation of steps in the time-space screening proce-
dures for semi-Markov processes, tracing pivotal orders for diﬀerent groups of
states as well as getting explicit formulas, for coeﬃcients and parameters of
upper bounds for remainders in the corresponding asymptotic expansions for
stationary distributions and moments of hitting times, do require additional
studies. It can be expected that such formulas can be obtained, for example,
for nonlinearly perturbed birth-death-type semi-Markov processes, for which
the proposed algorithms of phase space reduction preserve the birth-death
structure for reduced semi-Markov processes.

Applications to control and queuing systems, information networks, epi-
demic models and models of mathematical genetics and population dynamics,
analogous to those presented in the books cited in the introduction, also cre-
ate a prospective area for future research based on the asymptotic results
obtained in the present paper.

Appendix A: Operational rules for Laurent asymptotic expansions

Let us give short proofs of Lemmas 1∗ – 4∗ and 1 – 4 omitting some known

or obvious details.

A.1. The formulas given in Lemmas 1∗ and 1 are quite obvious.
A.2. The same relates to formulas in propositions (i) (the multiplication

by a constant rule) of Lemmas 2∗ and 2.

Proposition (ii) (the summation rules) of Lemmas 2∗ and 2 can be ob-
tained by simple accumulation of coeﬃcients for diﬀerent powers of ε and
terms accumulated in the corresponding remainders, and, then, by using ob-
vious upper bounds for absolute values of sums of terms accumulated in the
corresponding remainders.

Proposition (iii) (the multiplication rule) of Lemma 2∗ can be proved
by multiplication of the corresponding asymptotic expansions A(ε) and B(ε)
and accumulation of coeﬃcients for powers εl for l = hC, . . . , kC in their
product,

Obviously, oC (εkC )

εkC → 0 as ε → 0. It should be noted that the accumulation
of coeﬃcients for powers εl can be made in (8) only up to the maximal value
l = kC = (kA + hB) ∧ (kB + hA), because of the presence in the expression
for remainder oC(εkC ) terms bhB εhBoA(εkA) and ahAεhAoB(εkB).

Also, relation (9) readily implies relations (a) – (c), which determines

parameters δC, GC, εC in proposition (iii) of Lemma 2.

The assumptions of proposition (iv) in Lemma 2∗ imply that ε−hBB(ε) →
0 ≤ ε0 such
B(ε) is well deﬁned

bhB 6= 0 as ε → 0. This relation implies that there exists 0 < ε′
that B(ε) 6= 0 for ε ∈ (0, ε′
for ε ∈ (0, ε′

0], and, thus, function C(ε) = 1

0].

Note that hB ≤ kB. The assumptions of proposition (iv) of Lemma 2∗
imply that, εhBC(ε) = (bhB + · · · + bkBεkB−hB + oB(εhB)ε−hB)−1 → b−1
= chC
hB
as ε → 0. This relation means that function εhBC(ε) can be represented in
the form εhBC(ε) = chC + o(1), where chC = b−1
, or, equivalently, that the
hB
following representation takes place, C(ε) = chC ε−hB + o1(ε−hB), ε ∈ (0, ε′
0],
where o1(ε−hB )

ε−hB → 0 as ε → 0.

The latter two relations prove proposition (iv) of Lemma 2∗, for the case
hB = kB. Indeed, these relations mean that function C(ε) = 1
B(ε) can be
represented in the form of (hC, kC)-expansion with parameters hC = −hB,
kC = kB − 2hB = −hB = hC and coeﬃcient chC = b−1
. Moreover, since
hB

relation, (bhB εhB + o(εhB))(chC ε−hB + o1(ε−hB)) ≡ 1 that yields formula,

bhB εhB +oB (εhB ). This is formula (c) from proposition (iv) of
Lemma 2∗, for the case hB = kB. Note that, in the case hB = kB, the
above asymptotic expansion for function C(ε) can not be extended. Indeed,

Let us now assume that hB + 1 ≤ kB.

In this case, the assumptions
of proposition (iv) of Lemma 2∗ and the above asymptotic relations imply
that εhB−1o1(ε−hB) = εhB−1(C(ε) − chC ε−hB) = (bhB + · · · + bkB εkB−hB +
oB(εkB )ε−hB)−1(−bhB +1chC − · · · − bkB chC εkB−hB−1 − oB(εkB)chC ε−hB−1) →
−b−1
bhB +1chC = chC +1 as ε → 0. This relation means that function εhB−1
hB
·o1(ε−hB) can be represented in the form εhB−1o1(ε−hB) = chC +1 +o(1), where
chC +1 = −b−1
bhB +1chC , or, equivalently, that the following representation
hB
takes place, C(ε) = chC ε−hB + chC +1ε−hB+1 + o2(ε−hB+1), ε ∈ (0, ε′
0], where
o2(ε−hB +1)
ε−hB +1 → 0 as ε → 0.

The latter two relations prove proposition (iv) of Lemmas 2∗, for the
case hB + 1 = kB. Indeed, these relations mean that function C(ε) can be
represented in the form of (hC, kC)-expansion with parameters hC = −hB,
kC = kB − 2hB = −hB + 1 = hC + 1 and coeﬃcients chC = b−1
, chC +1 =
hB
−b−1
bhB +1chC . Moreover, since B(ε) · C(ε) ≡ 1, the remainder o2(ε−hB+1)
hB
can be found from the following relation, (bhB εhB + bhB +1εhB+1 + o(εhB+1))
·(chC ε−hB + chC +1ε−hB+1 + o2(ε−hB+1)) ≡ 1 that yields formula, o2(ε−hB+1) =
− bhB +1chC +1ε2+(chC ε−hB +chC +1ε−hB +1)oB (εhB +1)
. This is formula (c) from propo-
sition (iv) of Lemma 2∗, for the case hB + 1 = kB. Note that, in the case
hB + 1 = kB, the above asymptotic expansion for function C(ε) can not be

We can repeat the above arguments for the general case hB + n = kB,

hC = −hB, kC = kB − 2hB = −hB + n = hC + n and coeﬃcients chC , . . . , ckC

(hB + kC) = (kB − hB) ∧ (kB − 2hB + hB) = kB − hB. By canceling coeﬃcient
for εl on the left and right hand sides in relation (10), for l = 0, . . . , kB − hB,
and then, by solving equation (10) with respect to the remainder oC(εkC ),
we get the formula for this remainder given in proposition (iv) of Lemma 2∗,

εB ∈ (0, ε0] and ˜εB ∈ (0, ∞).

Inequality (13) proofs proposition (iv) of Lemma 2.
Propositions (v) of Lemmas 2∗ and 2 and relations (a) – (c) given in
these propositions can be obtained by direct application, respectively, of
propositions (iii) and (iv) of Lemmas 2∗ and 2, to the product D(ε) =
A(ε) ·

B(ε) .

Now, when it is already known that D(ε) = A(ε) ·

1
B(ε) is a (hD, kD)-
expansion, with parameters hD = hA − hB and kD = (kA − hB) ∧ (kB − 2hB +
hA), multiplication of D(ε) by B(ε) yields the following relation holding for
ε ∈ (0, ε′

By equating coeﬃcients for powers εl for l = hD, . . . , kD on the left and
right hand sides of the third equality in relation (14), we get alternative
formulas (e) for coeﬃcients dhd, . . . , dkD given in proposition (v) of Lemma
2∗.

Proposition (iii) of Lemma 2, applied to the product on the right hand

Inequality (16) yields relations (d) – (f) given in proposition (v) of

Lemma 2.

A.3. Lemma 3∗ is a direct corollary of Lemma 2∗. Proofs of proposi-
tions (i) and (ii) in Lemma 3 are analogous to proofs of the corresponding
propositions in Lemma 2. Proposition (iii) of Lemma 3 is obvious.

A.4. The ﬁrst two identities for Laurent asymptotic expansions given
in proposition (i) of Lemma 4∗ are obvious. The third identity given in
this proposition follows in an obvious way from proposition (i) of Lemma
2∗. By applying propositions (iii) and (iv) of Lemma 2∗ to the product
C(ε) = A(ε) · A(ε)−1, we get parameters hC = hA·A−1 = hA − hA = 0, kC =
kA·A−1 = (kA − hA) ∧ (kA − 2hA + hA) = kA − hA and coeﬃcients cn = I(n =
0), n = 0, . . . , kC. Also, relations (10) and (11) imply that the elimination
identity A(ε) · A(ε)−1 ≡ 1 holds, since the remainder of Laurent asymptotic

23

expansion for function A(ε)−1 is given by formula (c) from proposition (iv)
of Lemma 2∗.

Propositions (ii) and (iii) of Lemma 4∗ in the parts concerned com-
mutative property of summation and multiplication operations follow from,
respectively, propositions (ii) and (iii) of Lemma 2∗.

Let D(ε) = (A(ε) + B(ε)) + C(ε) = A(ε) + (B(ε) + C(ε)). Using propo-
sitions (ii) of Lemma 2∗, we get, hD = h(A+B)+C = (hA ∧ hB) ∧ hC =
hA ∧ (hB ∧ hC) = hA+(B+C) and kD = k(A+B)+C = (kA ∧ kB) ∧ kC =
kA ∧ (kB ∧ kC) = kA+(B+C). These relations and Lemma 1∗ imply equal-
ities for the corresponding coeﬃcients and remainders, for the asymptotic
expansions of functions (A(ε) + B(ε)) + C(ε) and A(ε) + (B(ε) + C(ε)).
The above remarks prove proposition (ii) of Lemma 4∗ in the part concerned
with the associative property of summation operation for Laurent asymptotic
expansions.

Let D(ε) = (A(ε) · B(ε)) · C(ε) = A(ε) · (B(ε) · C(ε)). Using propositions
(iii) of Lemma 2∗, we get, hD = h(A·B)·C = hA·B + hC = hA + hB + hC =
hA + hB·C = hA·(B·C) and kD = k(A·B)·C = (kA·B + hC) ∧ (kC + hA·B) =
((kA+hB)∧(kB+hA))+hC)∧(kC+(hA+hB)) = (kA+hB+hC)∧(kB+hA+hC)∧
(kC +hA+hB) = (kA+(hB+hC))∧((kB+hC)∧(kC +hB))+hA) = (kA+hB·C)∧
(kB·C + hA) = kA·(B·C). These relations and Lemma 1∗ imply equalities for
the corresponding coeﬃcients and remainders, for the asymptotic expansions
of functions (A(ε) · B(ε)) · C(ε) and A(ε) · (B(ε) · C(ε)). The above remarks
prove proposition (iii) of Lemma 4∗ in the part concerned with the associative
property of multiplication operation for Laurent asymptotic expansions.

Let D(ε) = (A(ε) + B(ε)) · C(ε) = A(ε) · C(ε) + B(ε) · C(ε). Using
propositions (ii) and (iii) of Lemma 2∗, we get, hD = h(A+B)·C = hA+B +
hC = hA ∧ hB + hC = (hA + hC) ∧ (hB + hC) = hA·C ∧ hB·C = hA·C+B·C and
kD = k(A+B)·C = (kA+B+hC)∧(kC +hA+B) = (kA∧kB +hC)∧(kC +hA∧hB) =
(kA +hC)∧(kB +hC)∧(kC +hA)∧(kC +hB) = ((kA +hC)∧(kC +hA))∧((kB +
hC) ∧ (kC + hB)) = kA·C ∧ kB·C = kA·C+B·C. These relations and Lemma 1∗
imply equalities for the corresponding coeﬃcients and remainders, for the
asymptotic expansions of functions (A(ε) + B(ε)) · C(ε) and A(ε) · C(ε) +
B(ε)·C(ε). The above remarks prove proposition (iv) of Lemma 4∗ concerned
with the distributive property of summation and multiplication operations
for Laurent asymptotic expansions.

Propositions (i) and (ii) of Lemma 4 readily follow from, respectively,
propositions (ii) and (iii) of Lemma 2. Finally, proposition (iii) of Lemma
4 follows from relations δcA = δA, δA+B, δA·B, δA/B ≥ δA ∧ δB and δA1+···+AN ,

Thus, remainders oiji(εl+

In this case,

Note that remainders oij(εl+

very irregular functions. Let us, for example, consider the case, where
all asymptotic expansions in condition D have the same order,

identities (20) take the
oij(εl+) = 0, ε ∈ (0, ε0], i ∈ X. Condition D requires that
form, Pj∈Yi
oij(εl+)/εl+ → 0 as ε → 0, for j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X. Remainders oij(εl+), j ∈ Yi, i ∈
X can be continuous functions of ε taking zero value in at most ﬁnite nume-
brs of points. However, let us multiply them, for example, by the Dirichlet
ij(εl+) = D(ε)oij(εl+), j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X
function D(ε). The new remainders o′
ij(εl+)/εl+ → 0 as ε → 0, for j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X.
also satisfy identities (20) and o′
At the same time, they are very irregular functions. This example is, of
course, an artiﬁcial one. But, it well illustrates the above statement about
possible irregularity of remainders and, in sequel, transition probabilities, as
functions of the perturbation parameter.

Let us also make some remarks concerned the expected sojourn times.
First, let us deﬁne eij(ε) = 0, ε ∈ (0, ε0] j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X that is consistent

with condition A (b).

Let us also eij(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X be some real-valued functions
which satisfy condition E, i.e., can be represented in the form of Laurent
asymptotic expansions, eij(ε) = P

It is useful to note that in the case, where condition E′ is assumed to
hold, an explicit value for parameters ˙εαij ,ij can be derived from the in-

conditions A (a) and B.

Finally, let us deﬁne ˜ε0 = ε′

0. Parameter, ˜ε0 can serve as a new value

for parameter ε0.

Functions pij(ε), i, j ∈ X and eij(ε), i, j ∈ X constructed above can serve,
respectively, as transition probabilities of the embedded Markov chain η(ε)
n
and expectations of sojourn times for some semi-Markov process η(ε)(t), for
every ε ∈ (0, ˜ε0]. A variant of transition probabilities for such semi-Markov
processes is given in Section 3∗.

In conclusion, let us consider a numerical example.
We assume that the semi-Markov process η(ε)(t) is, for every ε ∈ (0, ε0],

a semi-Markov process with the phase space X = {1, 2, 3}.

The transition sets are Y1 = {1, 2}, Y2 = {1, 2, 3}, Y3 = {1, 2}.

expansions representing elements of matrices given in relations (26) and (27),
are chosen according the procedures described above, in particular, the iden-
tities (20) hold. In this case, matrices, given in the above relations, can, for
every ε ∈ (0, ε0], serve as, respectively, the matrix of transition probabilities
for the corresponding embedded Markov chain and the matrix of expecta-
tions of sojourn times, for the semi-Markov process η(ε)(t), and conditions A
– E hold.

The matrices of transition probabilities kpij(ε)k, for the embedded Markov

The phase space X is one class of communicative states for the embedded
Markov chain η(ε)
n , for every ε ∈ (0, ε0], while it consists of two closed classes
of communicative states X1 = {1}, X2 = {2} and the class of transient states
X3 = {3}, for the limiting Markov chain η(0)
n .

By excluding the state 1 from the phase space X and using the algorithm
described in Section 5∗, we construct the reduced semi-Markov processes
1η(ε)(t), with the phase space 1X = {2, 3}. Conditions A – E hold for these
reduced semi-Markov processes. The corresponding transition sets are 1Y2 =
{2, 3} and 1Y3 = {2}. By applying the algorithms described in Lemma 8∗
and Theorems 2∗ and 3∗, we can compute the 2 × 2 matrices 1P = k1pij(ε)k
and 1E = k1eij(ε)k. These matrices take the following forms,

By excluding the state 2 from the reduced phase space 1X = {2, 3},
we construct the “ﬁnal” reduced semi-Markov processes h1,2iη(ε)(t), with the

30

one-state phase space h1,2iX = {3}. Conditions A – E also hold for these
semi-Markov processes. The corresponding transition set h1,2iY = {3}. The
transition probability h1,2ip33(ε) ≡ 1. By applying the algorithms described in
Theorem 4∗, we can also compute the Laurent asymptotic expansion for the
expected return time, h1,2ie33(ε) = E33(ε) = 21
2 ε−1 − 3 + ¨o33(1). The Laurent
asymptotic expansion for the expected sojourn time e3(ε) = e31(ε) + e32(ε) +
e33(ε), obtained with the use of the multiple summation rule given in Lemma
3∗, has the following form, e3(ε) = 3ε−1 + 1 + ˙o3(1). Finally, the algorithm
described in Theorem 5∗ gives the following asymptotic expansion, for the
stationary probability π3(ε) = e3(ε)

E33(ε) = 3ε−1+1+ ˙o3(1)

147 ε + o3(ε).

Also, by excluding the state 3 from the reduced phase space 1X = {2, 3}
and applying the algorithms described in Theorem 4∗, we can compute the
Laurent asymptotic expansion for the expected return time h1,3ie22(ε) =
E22(ε) = 21
4 ε + ¨o22(ε). In this case, the asymptotic expansion for the ex-
pected sojourn time e2(ε) = 3 + ε + 2ε2 + ˙o2(ε2), and the algorithm described
in Theorem 5∗ gives the following asymptotic expansion for the stationary
probability π2(ε) = e2(ε)

E22(ε) = 3+ε+2ε2+ ˙o2(ε2)

147 ε + o2(ε).

4 + 15

4 ε+¨o22(ε) = 4

21

As far as the stationary probability π1(ε) is concerned, the corresponding
asymptotic expansion can be found using the identity, π1(ε) = 1 − π2(ε) −
π3(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0], and the operational rules for asymptotic expansions given
in Lemma 3∗. This yields the asymptotic expansion, π1(ε) = 1
147 ε + o1(ε).
Alternatively, the exclusion of states from the phase space X in the oppo-
site order, ﬁrst state 3 and then state 2 or 1, and the use of the algorithms
described in Lemma 8∗ and Theorems 2∗ – 4∗ yield the asymptotic expan-
sions for the expected return times h3,2ie11(ε) = E11(ε) = 7ε + 15
3 ε2 + ¨o11(ε2)
and h3,1ie22(ε) = E22(ε) = 21
4 ε + ¨o22(ε). Then, the algorithm de-
scribed in Theorem 5∗ yields the same asymptotic expansions for station-
ary probabilities π1(ε) = e1(ε)
147 ε + o1(ε) and
π2(ε) = e2(ε)
4 ε+¨o22(ε) = 4

E11(ε) = ε+ε2+ ˙o1(ε2)
7ε+ 15
147ε + o2(ε).

E22(ε) = 3+ε+2ε2+ ˙o2(ε2)

3 ε2+¨o11(ε2) = 1

Note that the Laurent asymptotic expansion for the expectation E22(ε)
and, in sequel, the Taylor asymptotic expansion for the stationary probability
π2(ε) are invariant with respect to the choice the sequence of states h1, 3i or
h3, 1i for sequential exclusion from the phase space X. This is consistent with
the corresponding invariance statements formulated in Theorems 4∗ and 5∗.
The coeﬃcients of the asymptotic expansions πi(ε) = ci[0] + ci[1]ε +
oi(ε), i = 1, 2, 3 given above satisfy relations, c1[0] + c2[0] + c3[0] = 1 and

31

c1[1] + c2[1] + c3[1] = 0. This is consistent with the corresponding statement
in Theorem 5∗.

In the example presented above, we did not trace the explicit formulas for
remainders o1(ε), o2(ε) and o3(ε). However, according to the corresponding
statement in Theorem 5∗, these remainders are connected by the following
identity o1(ε) + o2(ε) + o3(ε) ≡ 0.

We would like also to explain an unexpected,

in some sense, asymp-
totic behavior of stationary probabilities πi(ε), in the above example. As
a matter of fact, states 1 and 2 are asymptotically absorbing states with
non-absorption probabilities of diﬀerent order, respectively, O(ε2) and O(ε).
While, state 3 is a transient asymptotically non-absorbing state. This, seems,
should cause convergence of the stationary probability π1(ε) to 1 and the sta-
tionary probabilities π2(ε) and π3(ε) to 0 as ε → 0, with diﬀerent rates of
convergence. This, however, does not take place, and all three probabilities
converge to non-zero limits. This is because of the expected sojourn times
e1(ε), e2(ε) and e3(ε) have orders, respectively, O(ε), O(1) and O(ε−1). These
expectations compensate absorption eﬀects for states 1, 2 and 3.

In the above example, computations of explicit upper bounds for remain-
ders in the asymptotic expansions for stationary probabilities π1(ε), π2(ε)
and π3(ε) can also be realized in the case, where conditions D′ and E′ hold
instead of conditions D and E. We, however, omit this presentation, in order
to escape overloading the paper by technical numerical computations.
