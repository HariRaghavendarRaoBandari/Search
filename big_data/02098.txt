Exotic mapping class group actions on the circle

SANG-HYUN KIM AND THOMAS KOBERDA

Abstract. It has been known since the time of Nielsen that the mapping class
group Modg,1 of a surface of genus g and one puncture acts faithfully by homeo-
morphisms on the circle. In this note, we show that this standard representation
of the mapping class group is not rigid; precisely, if G ă Modg,1 is a ﬁnite index
subgroup then there exist inﬁnitely many non–conjugate faithful representations
G Ñ Homeo`pS 1q. We thus answer a question of B. Farb.

1. Introduction

Let S “ S g,n be an orientable surface of genus g ě 2 and n ě 1 punctures,
and let Modg,n denote the mapping class group of S . The classical work of Nielsen
furnishes a faithful action of the mapping class group Modg,1 by orientation pre-
serving homeomorphisms on the circle S 1. Precisely, S 1 is identiﬁed with BH2,
and then a mapping class ψ P Modg,1 is lifted to a homeomorphism of H2, which
extends to a homeomorphism of BH2 in a way which depends only on the ho-
motopy class of ψ. The presence of a puncture allows one to coherently lift the
action of the entire mapping class group, thus giving a faithful homomorphism
ρ0 : Modg,1 Ñ Homeo`pS 1q.

In light of Nielsen’s construction, a natural question about representations of
Modg,1 into Homeo`pS 1q is whether or not they are rigid. More precisely, one asks
whether the natural representation ρg is the unique faithful representation of Modg,1,
up to equivalence of representations. Let G be a group and let

σ1, σ2 : G Ñ Homeo`pS 1q

be representations. We say σ1 and σ2 are equivalent if there exist

α P AutpGq, γ P InnpHomeo`pS 1qq

such that σ1 “ γ ˝ σ2 ˝ α. Notice that if α is the identity automorphism then σ1 and
σ2 are conjugate. The main result of this note is the following:
Theorem 1.1. Let G ă Modg,1 be a ﬁnite index subgroup. Then there exist inﬁnitely
many pairwise inequivalent injective homomorphisms G Ñ Homeo`pS 1q.

The reader will note that Theorem 1.1 resolves Question 6.2 of [5] in the negative.
The original motivation for Farb’s question was the hope that there may be a general
dynamical characterization of mapping class group actions on the circle, by analogy
to the case of convergence groups as resolved by Tukia, Casson–Jungreis, and Gabai
(see [11, 3, 7]).

Theorem 1.1 is stated for once–punctured mapping class groups, and a result for
larger numbers of punctures is beyond the methods of this article because of our
fundamental reliance on the Dehn–Nielsen–Baer Theorem (Section 3.3).
In our
setup, we will state intermediate results for general Modg,n when possible. The
proof of Theorem 1.1 follows from basic facts about the actions of mapping classes
under ρg and the existence of injective homomorphisms between mapping class
groups which are not type–preserving. While the arguments given in this note are
not diﬃcult, exotic (i.e. inequivalent to ρg) representations of Modg,1 do not seem
to have been found up to now.

3. Background

3.1. Point–pushing map. Recall that each mapping class on a surface has a type or
Nielsen–Thurston classiﬁcation, namely ﬁnite order, reducible, or pseudo-Anosov.
The Dehn twist Tγ along a simple closed curve γ is an example of a reducible
mapping class.

The group Modg,n ﬁts into the Birman exact sequence:

1

/ π1pS g,n´1q

P

/ Modg,n

F

/ Modg,n´1

/ 1,

where F : Modg,n Ñ Modg,n´1 is given by ﬁlling in a puncture of S g,n (see [2, 6]).
The map P : π1pS g,n´1q Ñ Modg,n is called the point–pushing map. If 1 ‰ γ P
π1pS g,n´1q, a result of Kra characterizes the type of the mapping class γ P Modg,n in
terms of the topology of γ:

Theorem 3.1 ([9]). For γ P π1pS g,n´1q, the mapping class Ppγq P Modg,n is
pseudo-Anosov if and only if γ is a ﬁlling curve, i.e.
the free homotopy class of
γ essentially intersects every other nontrivial free homotopy class of curves which
is not parallel to a puncture.

3.2. Actions of mapping classes on BH2. We use the notation ρg : Modg,1 Ñ
Homeo`pS 1q for the representation furnished by Nielsen’s construction, which is
well–deﬁned up to conjugacy in Homeo`pS 1q (see [4] for a detailed discussion).

Lemma 3.2. Let ψ P Modg,1 be a nontrivial mapping class.

(1) If ψ has ﬁnite order, then | Fixpρgpψqq| “ 0.
(2) If ψ is a nonzero power of the image of some simple closed curve under the

point pushing map, then | Fixpρgpψqq| “ 2.

(3) If ψ is pseudo-Anosov, then 4 ď | Fixpρgpψqq| ă 8.

Proof. We think of S g,1 as having a marked point q on S g instead of a puncture,
which from the point of group theory makes no diﬀerence.

If ψ has ﬁnite order then ρgpψq is conjugate to a rotation and therefore has no

ﬁxed points in S 1, establishing (1).

In (2), let us write ψ “ Ppcnq for some simple closed curve c P π1pS gq and n ‰
0. We can ﬁnd two simple closed curves γ and δ on S g which bound an annulus A
such that q P A and ψ “ pTγT ´1
δ qn. Let us consider the universal cover p : pH2, ˜qq Ñ
pS , qq. We let ˜A be the component of p´1pAq containing ˜q. We have an action of
π1pS q on H2 so that c preserves ˜A. There exists a lift ˜ψ : H2 Ñ H2 of ψ such that
˜ψ restricts to the identity on p´1pAq and such that ˜ψ preserves each component of
p´1pAq. Compose ˜ψ with a nonzero power of c so that the resulting composition
˜ψ1 ﬁxes ˜q. Then ˜ψ1 is the lifting of ψ obtained by the Nielsen’s construction. Note
that ˜A is the only component of p´1pAq preserved by c, since c is loxodromic. In
particular, we have | Fixpρgpψqq| “ | Fixp ˜ψ1q X BH2| “ 2.

If ψ is pseudo-Anosov, conclusion (3) follows from Theorem 5.5 of [4].

3.3. Homomorphisms which are not type–preserving. An injective homomor-
phism φ : Modg,n Ñ Modh,m is called type–preserving if φpψq is reducible if and
only if ψ is reducible. Automorphisms of Modg,n for g ě 2 are type–preserving [8].
In [1], Aramayona–Leininger–Souto produce the ﬁrst known examples of injective
homomorphisms between mapping class groups which are not type–preserving. Be-
cause their construction is essential for our proof of Theorem 1.1, we recall it here.
Let S be a closed surface of genus g ě 2, and write Γ “ π1pS q. The Birman

exact sequence for the extended mapping class group Mod˘

g,1 is as following.

1

/ π1pS q

P

/ Mod˘
g,1

F

/ Mod˘
g

/ 1.

The Dehn–Nielsen–Baer Theorem [6], combined with the Five Lemma and the
fact that Γ has trivial center together immplies that the following exact sequence is
isomorphic to the above Birman exact sequence:

1 Ñ InnpΓq Ñ AutpΓq Ñ OutpΓq Ñ 1.

We say a subgroup H of a group G is characteristic if H is preserved by every
automorphism of G. A cover p : Y Ñ X is characteristic if π1pYq is a characteristic
subgroup of π1pXq.

Lemma 3.3. If G is a countable, residually ﬁnite group, then there exists a sequence
of subgroups

G “ H0 ě H1 ě H2 ě ¨ ¨ ¨

such that for each 0 ď m ă n the group Hn is a ﬁnite index, characteristic subgroup

of Hm and such thatŞmě0 Hm “ t1u.
Proof. Choose a sequence tGnuně1 of ﬁnite index subgroups of G such thatŞn Gn “

t1u. Let H0 “ G. Having deﬁned Hn for some n ě 0, we let

Hn`1 “ č tK : K ď Hn and rHn : Ks “ rHn : Gn`1 X Hnsu .

(cid:3)

Let p : rS Ñ S be a ﬁnite characteristic cover. We write rΓ for π1prS q, we choose
a marked point rq P rS such that pprqq “ q, and we write p˚ : rΓ Ñ Γ for the map on
fundamental groups induced by p. We obtain a map ω : AutpΓq Ñ AutprΓq by
for each rγ P rΓ. Lemma 9 of [1] shows that ω is injective and hence induces an

ωpφqprγq “ pp˚q´1pφpp˚prγqq,

injective homomorphism Mod˘

As noted in [1], this map ω is also realized as the composition

g,1 Ñ Mod˘

h,1, where h is the genus of rS .
Mod˘pS , qq Ñ Mod˘´rS , p´1pqq,rq¯ Ñ Mod˘´rS ,rq¯ .

So we have a restriction:

ω : Modg,1 Ñ Modh,1 .

One of the interesting properties of ω is that it is often not type–preserving. The
following is a variation on the argument given in [1]:

Lemma 3.4. Let g ě 2. Then there exists a sequence tψnuně1 Ă Modg,1 of pseudo-
Anosov mapping classes and a sequence of injective homomorphisms

for some g ă h1 ă h2 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ such that the following hold:

tωn : Modg,1 Ñ Modhn,1uně1

(i) For each n ě 1, the mapping class ωnpψnq is a nonzero power of the image of

a simple closed curve under P : π1pS hn,1q Ñ Modhn,1;

(ii) For each 1 ď m ă n and for each σ in the extended mapping class group

Mod˘

g,1, the mapping class ωmpσψnσ´1q is pseudo-Anosov.

Proof. By applying Lemma 3.3 to π1pS gq, we have a tower of ﬁnite sheeted covers

such that g “ h0 ă h1 ă h2 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ and such that for each 0 ď m ă n, the given
cover S hn Ñ S hm is characteristic. Let us label the corresponding injections

Claim. For each n ě 1, there exists a simple closed curve δn in S hn such that pnpδnq
ﬁlls S hn´1.

For a covering map p : X Ñ Y, the corresponding deck transformation group is
denoted AutpX, pq. We can choose an ending lamination λn Ă S hn which is not
the pullback of a lamination along a nontrivial cover S hn Ñ S k for any k ă hn. It
is a standard fact that such laminations exist: for instance, λn could be the stable
lamination of a pseudo-Anosov mapping class which does not arise as a lift from
any lower genus surface.

It is also a standard fact that there is a sequence of simple closed curves tδn,kukě1
such that δn,k Ñ λn in the Hausdorﬀ topology on the space of projective measured
laminations [10]. Since λn is not a pullback, we have that for a suﬃciently high k,
the collection of curves AutpS hn, pnqδn,k ﬁlls S hn. We deﬁne δn “ δn,k for such k. It
follows that pnpδnq ﬁlls S hn´1. This proves the claim.

For each 1 ď m ă n, the curve pm`1 ¨ ¨ ¨ pn´1 pnpδnq ﬁlls S hm. Let us set

ψn “ P prp1p2 ¨ ¨ ¨ pnpδnqsq

and ωn “ qnqn´1 ¨ ¨ ¨ q1. Since δn is simple, we see that ωnpψnq “ Prδns is as
desired in (1). For 1 ď m ă n and σ P Mod˘

g,1, Theorem 3.1 implies that

ωmpσψnσ´1q “ qm ¨ ¨ ¨ q1P prp1p2 ¨ ¨ ¨ pnpσδnqsq “ P prpm`1 ¨ ¨ ¨ pnpσδnqsq

is pseudo-Anosov.

4. Proof of Theorem 1.1

We can now combine the facts gathered above to complete the proof of the main

result of this note.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. We let ρg : Modg,1 Ñ Homeo`pS 1q be the Nielsen’s repre-
sentation. Let tphn, ωn, ψnquně1 be as in Lemma 3.4. We deﬁne the faithful repre-
sentation

βn “ ρhn ˝ ωn : Modg,1 Ñ Homeo`pS 1q.

We claim that if G ă Modg,1 is a ﬁnite index subgroup, then the representations
tβnuně1 restricted to G are pairwise inequivalent, which suﬃces to establish the
result. One may replace each ψn by a suﬃciently high power if necessary, so that
ψn P G for each n.

Let us assume 1 ď m ă n and βmæG is equivalent to βnæG. Then we have α P
AutpGq such that βmæG ˝ α is conjugate to βnæG. Ivanov [8] proved that if G1, G2 ă

g,1 such that

g,n. So there exists some σ P Mod˘

By the choice of ψn and Lemma 3.2, we have that | Fixpβnpψnqq| “ 2 and that

| Fixpβm ˝ αpψnqq| “ | Fixpβmpσψnσ´1qq| ě 4.

Since the cardinality of the ﬁxed point set is conjugation invariant in Homeo`pS 1q,
we conclude that βm and βn are not equivalent.
