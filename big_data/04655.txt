We demonstrate that the spin orientation of an electron propagating in a one-dimensional nanos-
tructure with Rashba spin-orbit (SO) coupling is intimately related to the geometry of the system.
Shape deformations that result in a non-uniform curvature spatially tilt the SO ﬁeld perpendicu-
larly to the plane of the electron motion in an inhomogeneous way, and give rise to complex three-
dimensional spin textures in space. We employ the paradigmatic example of an elliptically deformed
quantum ring to unveil the way to get an all-geometrical and electrical control of the electron spin
orientation and the Aharonov-Anandan (AA) geometric phase. The resulting spin textures exhibit
a tunable topological character with windings around the radial and the out-of-plane directions. We
show that the AA geometric phase can be controlled not only by the spin-orbit strength but also by
the shape of the nanostructure through a series of transitions that are entangled to the windings of
the spin texture. Our results thereby establish a deep connection between electronic spin textures,
geometric phases and the nanoscale shape of the system.

Introduction – The manipulation and control of the elec-
tron spin are essential ingredients for the development
of innovative quantum-engineered devices [1–3]. The
Rashba SO coupling [4–6] is particularly attractive in this
framework because it oﬀers the promising prospect [7] of
an all-electrical intrinsic control over the spin without
applying a magnetic ﬁeld. The essential of any SO cou-
pling is that an electron traveling through an electric ﬁeld
experiences, in its rest frame, a magnetic ﬁeld that inter-
acts with the electron spin. For low-dimensional nanosys-
tems with structure inversion asymmetry, the coupling
between the orbital motion and the electron spin is due to
the so-called Rashba SO interaction [4–6]. The Rashba
SO is at the heart of a growing research interest for
the spin generation, manipulation and detection due to
the tantalizing possibilities of tuning the spin orientation
through the electron propagation and vice versa to exert
a spin control of the electron trajectories. Central con-
sequences of these constituent features are, among the
many possibilities, the Spin Hall and the galvanic eﬀects,
the SO driven spin-torque, the design of quantum topo-
logical states, etc.

Charge carriers in materials with Rashba SO are sub-
ject to a momentum dependent eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld
which not only results into a spin-dependent velocity but
also in a non trivial geometric phase. Such phase is an-
other important mean to manipulate the electron spin.
For instance, in the Aharonov-Casher eﬀect [9], magnetic
dipoles moving around a tube of electric charge acquire a
non trivial Berry [10] or geometric phase [11], being dual
to the case of the Aharonov-Bohm [12] eﬀect for charged
particles moving in a closed circuit around a magnetic
ﬂux. With the development of semiconducting nanos-
tructures, a possibility has emerged to tune quantum

states by combining Rashba eﬀects and geometric phases.
Considering the role of magnetic ﬁeld textures in driving
a spin geometric phase [13], the eﬀects of quantum ge-
ometric phases have been predicted [14] and experimen-
tally observed in the transport properties of semiconduct-
ing quantum rings [15, 16]. Such ﬁndings traced the path
to a spin topological design [17], as demonstrated by the
magnetic ﬁeld driven topological transition in the geo-
metric phase [16, 18].

In view of the rapid progress in nanostructuring tech-
niques, it would be highly challenging and desirable to
design nanostructures where the system geometry is the
main knob to tailor the electron spin properties. In this
Letter, we demonstrate that the curvature of a nanos-
tructure with Rashba SO coupling allows to manipulate
and control the spin orientation and the geometric phase.
We use the prototypical geometry of elliptical quantum
rings to unveil complex three-dimensional spin textures
in space and how they evolve in the presence of a non uni-
form curvature. The resulting spin patterns have distinct
topological features with tunable windings around the ra-
dial and the out-of-plane spin directions along the loop.
Remarkably, we ﬁnd diﬀerent type of transitions between
quantum states with inequivalent spin textures by vary-
ing the curvature strength or the Rashba SO coupling
thus indicating a unique path to control the electron spin
in curved nanostructures. We then demonstrate a fun-
damental twist between curvature, Rashba SO coupling
and spin geometric phase. The latter can be generally
tuned in a non-uniformly curved loop through a series of
topological-like transitions which are strongly entangled
to the character of the spin texture.

Curvature-driven spin torques– We start out with
the eﬀective Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional planarly

heﬀ = {0,−2αR, K(s)} lies in the normal-binormal
plane and depends on the local curvature and αR. The
spin direction then deﬁnes a Frenet-Serret-Bloch sphere
which is expressed in terms of the azimuthal and polar
angles θ(s) and ϕ(s) [Fig. 1(c)]. Eq. 2 generally implies
that due to a non zero curvature, the electron spin
acquires a ﬁnite out-of-plane binormal ˆz component.
More importantly, a non trivial component along the
tangential direction appears provided the curvature is
not constant. Albeit the derivative ∂s of the spin vector
locally vanishes if the spin is aligned to the eﬀective
spin-orbit ﬁeld, the variation of the local curvature
yields a non-vanishing torque which results into a
component of the spin vector parallel to the electron
propagation direction.
Insights into the electron spin
trajectories regulated by Eq. 2 can be gained by looking
at the spin velocity vector ﬁeld around the point on the
Frenet-Serret-Bloch sphere indicated by heﬀ [22].

The spin velocity vector ﬁeld exhibits a vortex-like
structure, with its core at the eﬀective spin-orbit ﬁeld
direction, and a strength which is set by the local cur-
vature value and αR. For a constant curvature, the vor-
tex is completely static while a non-homogeneous curva-
ture proﬁle leads to a vortex ﬂow with the core generally
evolving from the poles to the equator. Clearly, the vor-

where s is the arclength of the planar curve measured
from an arbitrary reference point, m(cid:63) is the eﬀective mass
of the charge carriers, and αSO is the Rashba SO cou-
pling strength. In addition, σN (s) is a local Pauli matrix
in the moving frame of the electrons as they propagate
along s, given by σN (s) = τ · ˆN (s), where ˆN (s) is the
local normal direction in the curve plane, while τ ’s are
the usual Pauli matrices. It is convenient to express the
normal and tangential directions to the curve in terms of
a polar angle f (s) as ˆN (s) = {cos f (s), sin f (s), 0}, and
ˆT (s) = {sin f (s),− cos f (s), 0}. Using the Frenet-Serret
type equation of motion, ∂s ˆN (s) = K(s) ˆT (s), where
K(s) is the local curvature, we can immediately relate
the polar angle to the local curvature via ∂sf (s) = −K(s)
1(a,b)]. To proceed further, we use the fact
[Figs.
that a spin eigenmode |ΨE(cid:105) of the Hamiltonian in Eq. 1
evolves in space according to i∂s|ΨE(cid:105) = G(s)|ΨE(cid:105) where

FIG. 3. Evolution of the spin orientation trajectories on the
Bloch sphere and of the three dimensional spin textures along
the ellipse shaped ring at a given ratio a/b = 0.4 and for
various values of the SO coupling (white circles in Fig.2),

(f), respectively. The blue portion of the trajectory stands

tex core is pinned very close to the equator (poles) if
the curvature is very large (small) as compared to the
Rashba SO inverse length αR. In addition, the strength
itself of the vortex dynamically changes as the curva-
ture changes. Figs. 1(d-e) show the characteristic ﬂow of
the spin velocity vector ﬁeld for representative values of
αR and curvature. The resulting trajectory of the elec-
tron spin will depend on how the spin direction is altered
by a collision with the vortex: i) the electron spin can
be trapped in the vortex, moving cooperatively with it,
and thus precesses around the spin-orbit ﬁeld direction;
ii) the vortex scatters the trajectory of the spin orienta-
tion, even to the other hemisphere, resulting in complex
three-dimensional spin textures. The changeover from
one regime to the other is a result of an intricate interplay
between the curvature strength and the ﬁrst and second
derivatives of K(s) that set the velocity and the accel-
eration of the vortex [22]. Elliptical quantum rings– We
next investigate the spin texture in a nanostructure with
non-uniform curvature by considering the example of a
quantum ring of length L with an elliptical shape and a
ratio a/b between the minor (a) and the major (b) axes of
the ellipse. This is a paradigmatic case of a nanostructure
with positive but non-uniform curvature that can be suit-
ably enhanced (suppressed) at the positions nearby the
poles of the major (minor) axes. In order to single out the
spin textures of the eigenmodes of the Hamiltonian in Eq.
1 at diﬀerent regimes of Rashba SO and a/b ratios, we
introduce a tight-binding model obtained by discretizing
Eq. 1 on a lattice [see the Methods paragraph], and study
the overall character of the spin textures by evaluating
the local spin orientation amplitudes. Consistently with
the gyroscope equation (Eq. 2), we ﬁnd that the spin pat-
terns as obtained from the tight-binding Hamiltonian are
independent of the eigenenergies, and thus the proﬁle of a
single spin eigenmode is uniquely determined by αR and
the ratio a/b. We then characterize “topologically” the

a function of the ellipse ratio a/b and the scaled spin-orbit
coupling LαR/(2π).

resulting spin texture by counting the number of wind-
ings around the normal ˆN and the binormal ˆz directions
the spin traces over the Frenet-Serret-Bloch sphere in a
single loop. Fig. 2 shows the corresponding phase dia-
gram in the a/b and αR parameter space. We observe
two distinct spin texture regimes. There is a region of
the parameter space (black area), corresponding to con-
ﬁgurations with strong SO or quasi-constant curvature,
where the electron spin is pinned nearby the quasi-static
eﬀective ﬁeld heﬀ and thus does not exhibit any winding
in the Frenet-Serret-Bloch sphere. For a/b below ∼ 0.5,
i.e. for a sizable non-uniform curvature proﬁle, the elec-
tron spin is not able to follow the periodic motion of
the eﬀective spin-orbit ﬁeld and manifests windings both
around the normal and the binormal directions. It fol-
lows that one can switch from a conﬁguration without
any winding to another with winding around the nor-
mal ˆN and/or the binormal ˆz directions through a pure
geometric eﬀect by tuning the ratio a/b.

Remarkably, the onset of the spin textures with a ﬁ-
nite number of windings can be achieved not only via a
shape deformation, but also by an all-electrical control of
the Rahsba spin-orbit inverse length αR. Below a crit-
ical threshold of the a/b ratio, indeed, we ﬁnd that an
increase in αR has a twofold eﬀect. First, it leads to an
increase in the winding number around the normal direc-
tion that clearly exhibits constant plateaus [Fig. 2(a)].
Second, the winding number around the binormal direc-
tion has an irregular comb-like structure with a switch-
able on and oﬀ behavior that is driven by tiny variations
of the Rashba spin-orbit inverse length [Fig. 2(b)]. To
highlight the features of the spin textures when moving
between diﬀerent regions of the phase diagram, we show
in Fig. 3 the spin trajectories in the Frenet-Serret-Bloch
frame and the spin textures in the Euclidean reference
frame for few representative values of the a/b and αR pa-
rameters. Starting from a regime of SO, such as LαR = 4,
we observe in Fig. 3(a) that the spin orientation is pinned
around heﬀ exhibiting a slight modulation of (cid:104)σN(cid:105) and
(cid:104)σz(cid:105) and a small (cid:104)σT(cid:105) tangential component that changes

its sign when moving along the loop. For a slightly larger
SO, i.e. LαR = 8, the system undergoes a ﬁrst transi-
tion in the winding number around the N direction [Fig.
3(b)], with a spin texture that has a change of sign for
(cid:104)σT(cid:105) by crossing the regions of small curvatures, close to
the minor axis of the ellipse, and a slight sign change of
(cid:104)σz(cid:105) nearby the pole of the major axis. Upon reaching
LαR = 10 the spin pattern exhibits non trivial windings
around the radial direction [Fig. 3(c)]. For such a SO
coupling we do notice that the spin trajectory on the
Frenet-Serret-Bloch sphere forms a knot when crossing
the region of the heﬀ vortex ﬂow. The emergence of such
a topological defect in the spin trajectory plays a crucial
role in the evolution of the winding number around the
N direction. Indeed, the knot is the seed through which
the spin texture can make a trajectory with a growing
solid angle, as reported in Fig. 3(d), until it yields a
transition with a change of the winding number again.
Hence, a further increase of αR allows a transition to a
conﬁguration with windings both around N and z spin
directions, with a spin texture that modulates in sign in
all the three components [Fig. 3(e)]. For intermediate
αR the spin texture exhibits many windings along the
loop [Fig. 3(f)].

Geometric control of the spin geometric phase– Let us
consider how to achieve a geometric control of the spin ge-
ometric phase. Geometrical and dynamical phases have
been widely investigated for rings with a regular circular
shape [14, 16]. Similarly to the case of circular quan-
tum rings with externally applied magnetic ﬁelds, we an-
alyze the eﬀect of shape deformation on the nonadiabatic
Aharonov-Anandan (AA) geometric phases [11]. The ge-
ometric AA phase gAA that a spin eigenmode |ΨE(cid:105) ac-
quires for a generic quantum loop is given by [22]:

(cid:19)
qN T = [(cid:104)σN(cid:105)∂s(cid:104)σT(cid:105) − (cid:104)σT(cid:105)∂s(cid:104)σN(cid:105)] /(cid:2)(cid:104)σT(cid:105)2 + (cid:104)σN(cid:105)2(cid:3). In

space region where the spin orientation is pinned close to
the quasi-static eﬀective SO ﬁeld direction. However, as
soon as the electronic spin starts to wind in the Frenet-
Serret-Bloch sphere around the binormal direction, and
hence qN T (cid:54)= 0, the spin geometric phase acquires non-
trivial π slips, which thereby result in sharp transitions
of the spin geometric phase which can be achieved by
either changing the a/b ratio or the Rashba SO inverse
length αR.

We have shown that shape deformations in nanostruc-
trures with Rashba SO coupling lead to the appearance of
complex three-dimensional spin textures where the elec-
tron spin acquires components even along the direction
of electron motion. For quantum rings deformed in el-
liptical shape, a fundamental consequence of the emer-
gent spin textures is a dramatic change of the AA phase,
where sharp π slips can be realized either by changing
the geometry or by an all-electrical tuning of the Rashba
spin-orbit coupling. We emphasize that our prediction
can be immediately tested in the laboratory.
Indeed,
considering InAs quantum rings with a typical length
L ∼ 300 nm, αSO ∼ 10−11 eV m, and the eﬀective
electron mass m∗ ∼ 0.05me, we have LαR/(2π) ∼ 2.
Taking into account the gate tunability of αSO [23] and
the modiﬁcation of the ellipse lengths, one can directly
access regimes of a/b between ∼ [0.3, 1.0] and LαR/(2π)
in the range of ∼ [2, 10]. By also considering that, apart
from conventional material geometries, nanostructuring
methods have recently achieved a level of control that
even enable the synthesis of complex three-dimensional
nanoarchitectures resembling biological structures [27],
our ﬁndings anticipate an unbound potential for new de-
vice concepts where the electron spin and the geometric
phase are directly controlled by the system geometry.

Eq. 3 the ﬁrst π term is the adiabatic spin geometric
phase the electron would acquire when pinned at the pole
of the Frenet-Serret-Bloch sphere, i.e. along the direction
of the spin-orbit ﬁeld. The second term corresponds to
the winding number of the normal and tangential spin
components around the binormal direction which gives
rise to π slips of the spin geometric phase, while the third
term accounts for the non-adiabatic nature of the AA
phase. It is worth pointing out that the contribution of
qN T can lead to a parity change of the geometric phase
and thus it can drive a topological transition for the AA
phase. For conventional circular quantum rings where
qN T ≡ 0, then the geometric phase is directly propor-
tional to the tilt of the electron spin in the binormal ˆz
direction [14, 16] (cid:104)σz(cid:105), and is hence gradually suppressed
as the Rashba spin-orbit inverse length increases. An
analogous behavior occurs also in the case of elliptical
quantum rings (the blue area in Fig. 4) in the parameter

I. APPENDIX

In this section we present the derivation of the
gyroscope-like equation for the spatial evolution of the lo-
cal spin orientation in a generic planarly curved nanowire
with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We also demonstrate
how the spin velocity vector ﬁeld behaves around the
positions corresponding to the locally vanishing eﬀec-
tive spin-orbit torque. Then, we present the expression
for the geometric phase acquired by an electron going
around a loop having a non trivial geometric curvature
and Rashba spin-orbit. Finally, we provide the details
for the continuum-to-lattice mapping of the Hamiltonian
for a curved nanowire and the methodology applied to
determine the phase diagrams.

A. Gyroscope equation for the local spin

orientation

We consider a generic planarly curved nanowire in the
presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling as described by
the Hamiltonian Hk·p. From the structure of Hk·p it

Hence, Hl and Hk·p have common eigenstates with an
eigenvalue relation given by Ek·p = E2
4γ . Let us in-
troduce the local spin orientation for a given spin eigen-
mode |ΨE(cid:105) as the corresponding expectation value of the
spin operators in the Frenet-Serret reference frame, i.e.
(cid:104)σ(cid:105) = {(cid:104)σT(cid:105),(cid:104)σN(cid:105),(cid:104)σz(cid:105)}. To determine the equations for
the spatial derivative of the local spin components it is
convenient to use the relation Hl|ΨE(cid:105) = El|ΨE(cid:105) for the
spin eigenmode wavefunction in such a way to single out
the spatial derivative as

From the Frenet-Serret equations for the normal and
tangential directions to the curved nanowire, ∂s ˆN (s) =
K(s) ˆT (s) and ∂s ˆT (s) = −K(s) ˆN (s), one can directly
deduce that ∂sσN (s) = K(s)σT (s) and ∂sσT (s) =
−K(s)σN (s). Hence, taking into account the Eqs. 4
for the spatial evolution of the eigenmode, one can ob-
tain the general expression for the spatial derivative of
the expectation value of the spin components

∂s(cid:104)σ(cid:105) = i(cid:104)[G, σ](cid:105) + (cid:104)∂sσ(cid:105)

(5)

with [A, B] indicating the commutator of A and B.

At this stage, by combining the Frenet-Serret equa-
tions for the spin operators and the Eq. 5, and con-
sidering that [G, σN ] = 0, [G, σT ] = 2iαRσz, [G, σz] =
−2iαRσT , and ∂sσz = 0, it follows:

∂s(cid:104)σN(cid:105) = K(s)(cid:104)σT(cid:105)
∂s(cid:104)σT(cid:105) = −2αR(cid:104)σz(cid:105) − K(s)(cid:104)σN(cid:105)
∂s(cid:104)σz(cid:105) = 2αR(cid:104)σT(cid:105)

(6)
The previous relations for ∂s(cid:104)σ(cid:105) can be rewritten in a
compact gyroscope-like form by introducing the eﬀective
spatial dependent ﬁeld heﬀ = {0,−2αR, K(s)} in the ba-
sis of the spin components (cid:104)σ(cid:105) = {(cid:104)σT(cid:105),(cid:104)σN(cid:105),(cid:104)σz(cid:105)} as

∂s(cid:104)σ(cid:105) = heﬀ × (cid:104)σ(cid:105) .

For completeness, we notice that from Eq. 5 one can
also deduce that the local electron density ρ(s) = (cid:104)Ψ|Ψ(cid:105)

5
is spatially constant as ∂s(cid:104)σ0(cid:105) = 0. Moreover, since the
spatial derivative of the spin vector is perpendicular to σ
it follows that the amplitude of the local spin component
(cid:104)σ(cid:105)2 is spatially uniform, i.e. ∂s ((cid:104)σ(cid:105) · (cid:104)σ(cid:105)) = 0.

B. Character of the spin-orientation velocity ﬁeld

We have shown that the amplitude of the spin is con-
stant along the proﬁle of the nanowire, thus the spin tra-
jectory can be analyzed by introducing a Bloch sphere in
the Frenet-Serret reference frame, where a point on the
sphere identiﬁes the spin orientation at a given position
s∗ through the angles {θ(s∗), ϕ(s∗)} (see Fig. 1 in the
main text of the manuscript). In spherical coordinates
the spin components can be expressed as

(cid:104)σN (s)(cid:105) = σ cos[θ]
(cid:104)σz(s)(cid:105) = σ sin[θ] cos[ϕ]
(cid:104)σT (s)(cid:105) = σ sin[θ] sin[ϕ] .

With this, the Eqs. (3) reduce to two independent equa-
tions for the derivative of the coordinates {θ(s), ϕ(s)}

θ = −K(s) sin[ϕ]
·
ϕ = −2αR − K(s) cos[ϕ]

tan[θ]

.

In order to analyze the character of the possible stable
points for the spin orientation trajectories we search for

·
θ and azimuthal

·
solutions where the polar
ϕ velocities
are vanishing. Assuming that the curvature is non sin-
gular along the nanowire, the polar and the azimuthal
velocities are zero at the points P1,2 such as ϕ = ϕ1,2 =0
or π and θ = θ1,2(s) = arccot[± 2αR
K(s) ]. It is worth point-
ing out that the vanishing of the eﬀective torque occurs
for points that lie in the normal-binormal plane for the
spin components independently on the geometric aspects
of the nanowire. On the other hand, the critical θ1,2(s)
evolve along the Frenet-Serre-Bloch sphere when chang-
ing the position s on the curved proﬁle. One can easily
obtain the cinematic parameters (velocity and accelera-
tion) of these points on the sphere by evaluating the ﬁrst

Then, the evolution of the θ1,2(s) is strongly interre-
lated to the geometry of the nanowire not only through
the strength of the curvature but also in the derivatives
of the curvature providing a direct connection between
the geometric curvature of the structure and the cine-
matic of the points where the velocities of the local spin
components vanish. To further understand the character

of the spin vector ﬂow we determine the Jacobian J of
the ﬁrst derivatives of the velocities at the points P1,2(s):

The eigenvalues of the matrix J will provide information
on the character of the solutions around the points P1,2.

The eigenvalues are imaginary for any value of the curva-
ture and the renormalized Rashba coupling αR and thus
the solutions for θ and ϕ to linear order are oscillating.
This result implies that around the points P1,2(s) the
trajectories of the velocity ﬁelds can form closed loops,
namely they have a vortex like proﬁle. When the cur-
vature varies along the proﬁle of the one-dimensional
nanostructure the vortex moves back and forth along the
Frenet-Serret-Bloch sphere from the north(south) pole to
the equator.

C. Aharonov-Anandan geometric phase

In order to determine the geometric phase acquired by
an electron moving along a closed loop, we follow the
original approach proposed by Aharonov-Anandan for
any cyclic evolution of a quantum system [11]. A spin
eigenmode |Ψ(s)(cid:105) of Hk·p evolves in space according to
the Eq. 4. Now, if we assume that the evolution is along
a closed curve of length L, the wave functions |Ψ(s)(cid:105) at
the initial and ﬁnal positions of the loop are related by a
phase factor eiβ, with β real, such as |Ψ(L)(cid:105) = eiβ|Ψ(0)(cid:105).
Then, we can deﬁne | ˜Ψ(s)(cid:105) = e−ib(s)Ψ(s)(cid:105) in such a
way that b(L) − b(0) = β. It immediately follows that
| ˜Ψ(L)(cid:105) = | ˜Ψ(0)(cid:105) and from Eq. 4 that

By removing the dynamical part from the phase β, we
can single out the geometric contribution [11] as

−∂sb(s) =

Now, we are interested in obtaining gAA for a generi-
cally curved quantum loop and in doing that we aim to
have an expression that directly links to the local spin
orientation of the evolving quantum state. The wave-
function |Ψ(s)(cid:105) can be generally expressed in the form

(cid:18) exp[−if (s)/2] exp[iθ⇑(s)]A⇑(s)

(cid:19)

|ΨE(cid:105) =

exp[if (s)/2] exp[iθ⇓(s)]A⇓(s)

where f (s) = (cid:82) s

0 K(¯s)d¯s, and {A⇑, A⇓} are real. This
structure for |Ψ(s)(cid:105) is convenient because the expectation
values of the local spin (cid:104)σ(cid:105) in the Frenet-Serret reference
frame is related to the components of the wave-function
by the following relations:

tan[θ⇑ − θ⇓] =

(cid:104)σT(cid:105)
(cid:104)σN(cid:105)
A2⇑ − A2⇓ = (cid:104)σz(cid:105)

| ˜Ψ(s)(cid:105) =

A⇑(s)

Now, it follows that the geometric phase in Eq. 7 can be
directly obtained by expanding the derivative of | ˜Ψ(s)(cid:105)
and using the relations between the components and the
spin amplitudes. The resulting expression is

D. Methods

Here, we present the mapping of the continuum Hamilto-
nian on the lattice of a planarly curved one-dimensional
nanostructure and the methods for the computation of
the spin texture. The phase diagrams corresponding to
the spin textures and the geometric phase of the spin
eigenmode for the elliptical shaped ring have been ob-
tained by solving the Rashba model Hamiltonian on an
eﬀective lattice system. By employing a conventional dis-
cretization procedure from the derivative in the contin-
uum to the ﬁnite diﬀerences in the lattice, one can show
that the Hamiltonian Hk·p can be mapped into an eﬀec-
tive lattice model [21] that reads

tances. This aspect does not inﬂuence the qualitative
outcome of the results. The local Rashba spin-orbit cou-
pling connecting nearest-neighbour sites is ˆαj,j+1 and
can be written in terms of the set of Pauli matrices
τ as ˆαj,j+1 = i αSO

cal shape encoded in the function f (s) via the curvature
K(s). The model Hamiltonian has been then diagonal-
ized assuming that the quantum loop has a given length
L and is composed of a given number of sites N . The
computation of the expectation values of the local spin
components of the eigenmodes has been performed for
a number of sites N varying from 500 to 1000. The re-
sults do not depend qualitatively from the number N and
are fully consistent with the prediction of the gyroscope
equation obtained for the continuum model.

[22] In the Appendix we present the derivation of the
gyroscope-like equation for the spatial evolution of the lo-
cal spin orientation in a generic planarly curved nanowire
with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate how
the spin velocity vector ﬁeld behaves around the positions
corresponding to the locally vanishing eﬀective spin-orbit
torque. Then, we derive the expression for the geometric
phase acquired by an electron going around a loop having
a non trivial geometric curvature and Rashba spin-orbit.
Finally, we provide the details for the continuum-to-
lattice mapping of the Hamiltonian for a curved nanowire
and the methodology applied to determine the phase di-
agrams.
