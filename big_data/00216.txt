Mercury Fulminate (MF) is one of the well-known primary explosives since 17th century and
it has rendered invaluable service over many years. However, the correct molecular and crystal
structures are determined recently after 300 years of its discovery. In the present study, we report
pressure dependent structural, elastic, electronic and optical properties of MF. Non-local correction
methods have been employed to capture the weak van der Waals interactions in layered and molecular
energetic MF. Among the non-local correction methods tested, optB88-vdW method works well for
the investigated compound. The obtained equilibrium bulk modulus reveals that MF is softer than
the well known primary explosives Silver Fulminate (SF), silver azide and lead azide. MF exhibits
anisotropic compressibility (b>a>c) under pressure, consequently the corresponding elastic moduli
decrease in the following order: C22>C11>C33. The structural and mechanical properties suggest
that MF is more sensitive to detonate along c-axis (similar to RDX) due to high compressibility of
Hg...O non-bonded interactions along that axis. Electronic structure and optical properties were
calculated including spin-orbit (SO) interactions using full potential linearized augmented plane
wave method within recently developed Tran-Blaha modiﬁed Becke-Johnson (TB-mBJ) potential.
The calculated TB-mBJ electronic structures of SF and MF show that these compounds are indirect
band gap insulators. Also SO coupling is found to be more pronounced for 4d and 5d-states of Ag
and Hg atoms of SF and MF, respectively. Partial density of states and electron charge density maps
were used to describe the nature of chemical bonding. Ag-C bond is more directional than Hg-C
bond which makes SF to be more unstable than MF. The eﬀect of SO coupling on optical properties
has also been studied and found to be signiﬁcant for both (SF and MF) of the compounds.

INTRODUCTION

Based upon sensitivity to the external stimuli such as
heat, shock, impact, friction, or electric charge, the high
explosives are classiﬁed into two categories namely pri-
mary and secondary. A typical explosive consists of a
main charge of secondary explosive with a high output
but low sensitivity to initiation, which is initiated by an
adjacent primary explosive, which transmits a suﬃciently
strong shock to the secondary explosive which leads to
detonation.1 Inorganic fulminates come under the class
of primary explosives, they ﬁnd applications as initiators
for secondary explosives and are iso-electronic with the
corresponding azides, cyanates and cyanamides.2 MF was
the ﬁrst, widely and long been used as primary explosive
due to its excellent priming power, high performance,
and it can be easily detonated.3 MF has rendered invalu-
able service over many years and this can be clearly seen
from its annual production only in Germany was about
1,00,000 kg per year in the beginning of 20th century.4
The wide application of dynamite was only possible when
the use of MF as initiator which guarantees a safe ignition
and hence it is used to initiate dynamite in metal blasting
cap detonator.4,5 MF detonate after the initiation with
external stimuli by producing CO, N2, and Hg as the de-
composition products: Hg(CNO)2 → Hg + 2CO + N2.6
MF is very sensitive to shock, impact, friction and sun-
light. MF is detonated by sparks and ﬂames3 and also it

is desensitized by addition of water. Since LA was found
to detonate more reliably (detonation velocity 4.25 km/s
for MF and 5.3 km/s for LA), less impact sensitivity (1-2
N m for MF and 2.5-4 N m for LA) and to have bet-
ter thermal stability (temperature of ignition 210oC for
MF and above 300oC for LA) and hence MF was largely
replaced by LA.7–9

Several methods were proposed in the literature to syn-
thesis MF, among them, Howard’s interpretation for the
formation of MF from mercury, nitric acid and ethanol
was widely accepted.10–12 However, MF has been used as
a primary explosive for a long time but the determina-
tion of its crystal symmetry is an extensive debate until
2007. Since 1931 several investigations have been made
to determine the crystal structure of MF using single
crystal2,13,14 and powder X-ray diﬀraction methods15,16
but these attempts were unsuccessful to determine cor-
rect crystal structure of MF. Recently, Beck et al17 re-
ported the correct crystal structure of this energetic com-
pound. Moreover, Density Functional Theory (DFT) cal-
culations have been carried out for a single molecule of
MF at B3LYP level and they predicted bent CNO-Hg-
ONC units of molecular structure.18 Once again Beck et
al3 made a detailed theoretical investigation on molecular
structure of MF and they proved that the molecular and
Lewis structure of MF is linear in gas phase i.e. ONC-
Hg-CNO. The molecular structure is in contrast to the
previous theoretical prediction18 but it is in good accord

with their recent X-ray diﬀraction study.17 In addition
the authors also proposed that Hg-C-N angle is 180 o in
isolated molecule whereas it is 169 o in the crystalline
solid form which is due to intermolecular interactions
and packing eﬀects.3 However, except the crystal struc-
ture most of the fundamental physical properties are un-
known for the investigated compound at electronic level.
With this motivation, we performed a detailed study of
structural and mechanical properties under pressure up
to 5 GPa using advanced dispersion corrected methods
and electronic structure, optical properties by including
SO interactions at ambient pressure by means of ﬁrst
principles calculations within the frame work of density
functional theory (DFT). The rest of the article is orga-
nized as, in section II, we brieﬂy describe methodology
of our calculation. In section III, the structural, elastic,
electronic structure and optical properties of MF are dis-
cussed. Finally, in section IV, we summarize the results,
which concludes our paper.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

First principles calculations were performed using the
Vienna ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP)19 based on
DFT with the all-electron projected augmented wave
(PAW) method. The ion-cores are described within
the PAW method while electron-electron interactions
are treated with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)20
parametrization of the generalized gradient approxima-
tion (GGA) with plane wave cut-oﬀ energy of 1000 eV
and a 9×9×5 k-mesh according to the Monkhorst-Pack
grid scheme.21 Quasi-Newton algorithm is used to relax
the ions and the system was fully relaxed with residual
forces smaller than 0.001 eV/˚A.

In order to treat weak dispersive interactions, there
are two kinds of dispersion corrections; ﬁrst one is pair-
wise additive correction, second one is non-local correc-
tion and both of these methods have shown remarkable
success recently. In the ﬁrst method, vdW parameters for
heavy metals (namely Cs, Ba, Hg, Tl, Pb and Bi etc.)
i.e. 6th and 7th periods of the periodic table elements are
not well optimized whereas the second method is used to
study the simple as well as heavy metal based systems
and the results show success of this method in treating
the van der Waals (vdW) interactions for wide range of
materials. Therefore, in the present study, we have used
the second method so-called non-local correction method
proposed by Dion et al22 and further modiﬁed by Klimes
et al,23 in which the vdW contribution to the total en-
ergy is described through modiﬁcations to the correla-
tion energy functional within DFT. Speciﬁcally, the DFT
exchange-correlation functional takes the form:

Exc = EGGA

x

+ ELDA

c

+ Enl
c

x

c

is the exchange energy,20 ELDA

Here EGGA
is the local
density approximation (LDA) correlation energy24 and
Enl
c

is the non-local correction which is given by

2

Enl

c = 1

2 Z dr Z n(r)φ(r,r′)n(r′) dr′

where n(r) is the electron density and the kernel φ(r,r′)
is a function of n(r) and n(r′), their gradients, and r-r′.
However, this method requires massive computation to
evaluate the double integral in the above equation using
the fast-Fourier transform grid points, especially for large
cells.25

It is well known fact that the standard DFT func-
tionals severely underestimate the band gap by 30-
40% for semiconductors and insulators.26 In contrast to
LDA/GGA functionals, recently developed Tran-Blaha
modiﬁed Becke Johnson (TB-mBJ)27 potential shows re-
markable success in predicting the energy band gaps for
diverse materials28–31 and competing with the compu-
tationally expensive methods such as GW approxima-
tion and hybrid functionals. Therefore, in the present
work, TB-mBJ potential has been used to get reliable
energy band gap thereby calculation of electronic struc-
ture and optical properties of SF and MF. This semi-local
potential is implemented through WIEN2K package.32
To achieve the required convergence of energy eigenval-
ues, the wave functions in the interstitial region were ex-
panded using plane waves with a cut-oﬀ Kmax = 7/RMT
while the charge density was Fourier expanded up to
Gmax = 14, where Radius of Muﬃn Tin (RMT) is the
smallest atomic sphere radius and Kmax denotes the mag-
nitude of the largest K vector in plane wave expansion.
The RMT radii are assumed to be 2.0, 1.05, 1.05 and
1.25 Bohrs for Ag/Hg, C, N and O, respectively. The
wave functions inside the spheres are expanded up to
lmax = 10. Self-consistency of total energy is obtained
by using 9×9×5 k-mesh in the Irreducible Brillouin Zone
(IBZ). The frequency-dependent optical properties have
been calculated using a denser k-mesh of 19× 19×12 in
the IBZ.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Crystal structure

MF is a long standing primary explosive but the molec-
ular geometry and crystal structure of MF has been
resolved more than 300 years of after its discovery.17
The chemical formula of MF i.e. Hg(CNO)2 is analogous
to the corresponding Mercury Azide (MA), Hg(NNN)2.
Moreover, the fulminate and/or azide single anion is lin-
ear and contain 16 valence electrons resulting a negative
charge. MF crystallizes in the orthorhombic centro sym-
metric space group Cmce with lattice parameters a =
5.470˚A, b = 10.376˚A, c = 7.70˚A, V = 437.03 ˚A3, and
Z = 4.17 While MA crystallizes in non-centro symmetric
space group Pca21 with lattice parameters a = 10.632˚A,
b = 6.264˚A, c = 6.323˚A, V = 421.10 ˚A3 and Z = 4,33 con-
sequently MA is ∼ 4% more densely packed than MF.17
As shown in ﬁgure 1, the crystal structure consists of MF
molecule at each corner as well as face centre of the unit

cell (see ﬁgure 1a), the planar MF molecules are located
at x = 0 and x = 0.5 along b-axis17 and the layers are
stacked along a and c-axes as depicted in ﬁgure 1b and
1c, respectively. Apart from this, experimental measure-
ments reveal that the arrangement of MF molecules in
b-c plane leads to two non-bonded contacts between Hg
and O atoms (see ﬁgure 1d) with a distance of Hg...O =
2.833 ˚A within the unit cell, which is less than the sum of
the vdW radii 3 ˚A of Hg and O atoms (vdW radii 1.5 ˚A
for Hg and O atoms) which causes weak vdW interactions
in the crystalline MF.17 The intermolecular interactions
play a signiﬁcant role in predicting the structure and sta-
bility of the layered and molecular crystalline solids.

The eﬀect of SO coupling is of minor importance for
structural optimization.35,37,43? Therefore, we ﬁrst ob-
tain the ground state crystal structure of MF by per-
forming full structural optimization of both lattice con-
stants and internal co-ordinates without inclusion of SO
interactions. The obtained equilibrium volume of MF
is overestimated by ∼ 20.9% within PBE-GGA func-
tional. This clearly represents that the standard PBE-
GGA functional
is inadequate to predict the ground
state properties of the energetic layered and molecular
solid MF. Recently, usage of non-local correction meth-
ods become successful in describing the structural prop-
erties of energetic molecular solids,25,38–40 nitrogen rich
salts,41 organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite,42,43 and lay-
ered materials.44 With this motivation, we have also used
various non-empirical dispersion corrected methods to
capture vdW interactions to reproduce the ground state
properties which are comparable with the experiment.17
The computed ground state volume with non-local dis-
persion corrected methods for MF is overestimated by
around 1.7% using vdW-DF; 5.9% using vdW-DF2 and
underestimated by around 0.4% using optB88-vdW; 1.1%
using optB86b-vdW methods. Among the examined non-
local dispersion corrected methods, optB88-vdW method
works well
for the MF. The small discrepancies be-
tween theoretical values at 0 K and experimental data
at 295 K17 were observed. The order of discrepancies
about ∼0.4-5.9% are previously reported for secondary
explosive molecular crystals with vdW-DF methods at
0 K.25,38,40 The calculated ground state unit cell lattice
constants, volume and density of MF using various non-
local correction methods are compared with the exper-
imental data17 and are presented in Table I. In addi-
tion, we have also calculated the intra-molecular inter-
actions for equilibrium structure obtained using optB88-
vdW method. The calculated bond lengths Hg-C, C-N
and N-O are 2.028 (2.029), 1.172 (1.143), 1.235 (1.248) ˚A
and bond angles Hg-C-N, C-N-O and C-Hg-C are 167.7
(169.1), 179.7 (179.7) and 180 (180) o respectively, which
are in good agreement with the experimental17 results
given in parenthesis. The C≡N bond length in an iso-
lated molecule is 1.160 ˚A and the calculated value for
MF is 1.172 ˚A which is strongly suggesting that there
exists a triple bond between C and N atoms as observed
in the experiment (d(C≡N ) = 1.143 ˚A).17 As discussed in

3

section I, MF possesses perfect linear molecular structure
in single molecular gas phase.3 While in the crystalline
solid form, the calculated angle between Hg-C and C-N
bonds is 167.7o and it is deviated by 12.3o from linearity
(180o) which is in good agreement with experimental17
deviation of 11o. This deviation clearly indicates that
slightly distorted linear molecular structure of MF in the
crystalline form when compared to its molecular struc-
ture in gas phase.

B. Equation of State and Compressibility

We turned our attention to investigate the eﬀect of
hydrostatic pressure on crystal structure of MF. In or-
der to understand the behavior of unit-cell parameters
and their relative compressibilities under compression,
we have presented the lattice constants as a function of
pressure. The pressure dependent lattice constants show
that a and c lattice constants decrease whereas lattice
constant ’b’ increases with pressure. Increase of lattice
constant ’b’ under hydrostatic pressure is interesting in
MF and this is similar to the case of silver azide (SA)45
in which lattice constant ’a’ increases as a function of
pressure for ambient phase (Ibam). This clearly indi-
cates the anisotropic behavior of lattice constants under
the studied pressure range as depicted in ﬁgure 2a. Equa-
tion of state (EOS) represents the functional relationship
between the thermodynamic variables (pressure, volume
and temperature) for solids. The calculated volume de-
crease monotonically as a function of pressure as shown in
ﬁgure 2b. By ﬁtting pressure-volume data to third-order
Birch-Murnaghan equation of state,46 the obtained equi-
librium bulk modulus (B0) and its pressure derivative are
found to be 12.2 GPa and 7.9 respectively using optB88-
vdW. However, the calculated B0 value 12.2 GPa for MF
is lower than that of SF (20 GPa),47 SA (39 GPa)48 and
LA (26 GPa49 and 41 GPa50) which indicates the soft na-
ture of MF when compared to other well-known primary
explosives.

Further, to understand the compressibility of MF, nor-
malized lattice constants, bond lengths and bond an-
gles are plotted as a function of pressure as displayed
in ﬁgure 3. The pressure dependent lattice constants
show anisotropic axial compressibilities of 96.2%, 102.4%
83.3% along a, b, and c crystallographic directions, re-
spectively and the order of compressibility is as follows
b>a>c. As depicted in ﬁgure 3a, c-axis is the most com-
pressible for MF which is due to high compressibility of
non-bonded Hg...O intermolecular interactions along the
c-axis as shown in ﬁgure 3b. While the intra-molecular
bonds Hg-C, C-N, and N-O show very less compressible
nature (see ﬁgure 3b) over the studied pressure range.
This clearly shows that the intermolecular interactions
are weaker than intra-molecular interactions in the lay-
ered MF. The bond angle Hg-C-N shows more compress-
ible behavior whereas C-N-O and C-Hg-C exhibit less
compressible nature under the studied pressure range as

depicted in ﬁgure 3c. Overall, we observe that Hg-C, C-
N, and N-O bonds are stiﬀer whereas Hg...O non-bonded
distance is more compressible under the application of
hydrostatic pressure.

C. Elastic constants and mechanical properties

Elasticity describes the response of a crystal under ex-
ternal strain which gives an information about the bond-
ing characteristics for the anisotropic character of the
solid.51 Quantifying and understanding the elastic re-
sponse of energetic materials is a necessary ﬁrst step to-
wards determining the mechanical and chemical mecha-
nisms that produce this anisotropic behavior under shock
loading.52 Numerous researchers focused their attention
on understanding detonation initiation by mechanical
shock.53 Detonation of an energetic material can be con-
sidered as a collective property of the material and is
highly depends upon intermolecular interactions, molec-
ular arrangements, and molecular composition which has
a measurable eﬀect on the macroscopic properties of the
energetic solid.54 Therefore, we focused our attention to
understand the elastic behavior of energetic MF. Due to
orthorhombic crystal symmetry, MF has nine indepen-
dent elastic constants namely C11, C22, C33, C44, C55,
C66, C12, C13, and C23. As presented in Table II, the cal-
culated elastic constants are positive and obey the Born’s
mechanical stability criteria,55 which indicate that MF
is mechanically stable at ambient pressure. A direction
in which intermolecular interactions are weak would re-
ﬂect a higher compressibility along that direction. The
compressibility of orthorhombic lattice constants a, b,
and c can be directly correlated with the diagonal elas-
tic constants C11, C22, and C33, respectively. As dis-
cussed in the above section, the compressibility order for
the investigated compound is b>a>c which reveals that
MF has the weakest interactions along the c-axis due to
weak intermolecular interactions along c-axis (see ﬁgure
1d). Consequently, C33 possesses lowest value in magni-
tude among the three diagonal elastic moduli and they
decrease in the following order C22>C11>C33 as com-
pressibility order of the lattice constants (b>a>c). Pre-
viously Haycraft et al53,54 made a correlation between
linear compressibility and elastic constants thereby rele-
vance to shock detonation sensitivity for RDX and CL-20
single crystals. They reported that RDX and CL-20 are
found to be more sensitive to detonation along c and a-
axes, respectively. On the similar path, the calculated
compressibility and elastic moduli disclose that MF is
found to be more sensitive to detonation along the c-
axis. The other three diagonal elastic constants decrease
as follows: C55>C44>C66. C66 and C44 are found to be
relatively small compared to C55, which is an indication
of the soft shear transformation along (001) and/or (100)
planes. On the other hand, three oﬀ-diagonal elastic con-
stants (C12, C13, and C23); C12 and C13 couple an applied
normal stress component in the a-direction with uniaxial

4

strain along b- and c-axis respectively while C23 couples
a applied normal stress along b-direction with an uniax-
ial strain along c-axis.54 C23 has the largest value among
the three transverse coupling elastic moduli and the low
values of C12 and C13 would suggest that the crystal sys-
tem is susceptible to shear along the crystallographic b-
and c-axes when normal stress is applied along crystallo-
graphic a direction. In addition, we have also calculated
the elastic moduli as a function of pressure. As depicted
in ﬁgure 4, all the elastic moduli increase (except C66),
especially C22 grows rapidly as a function of pressure.
However, we observe a softening of C66 elastic constant
with pressure which may induce shear instability in MF
under high pressure.

When mono-crystalline samples are not available then
it is not possible to measure the single crystal elastic
constants.
Instead, the polycrystalline bulk and shear
moduli may be determined i.e. the average isotropic elas-
tic moduli can be obtained from anisotropic single crys-
tal elastic moduli.56 The Vigot, Reuss and Hill approxi-
mations can predict the theoretical maximum, minimum
and average polycrystalline elastic moduli, respectively.
The obtained B0 value 12.2 GPa from EOS is comparable
with the derived BR value of 14.2 GPa. Shear modulus
GR value 3.6 GPa is closely comparable (in magnitude)
with the novel secondary explosive CL-2053 using Reuss
approximation and the low value of shear moduli indi-
cates that overall MF is more susceptible to shear forces.
In addition, we also made an attempt to calculate the
sound wave velocities thereby Debye temperature of MF
using the expressions given in Ref.36 as presented in Ta-
ble II using the isotrpic elastic moduli obtained from Hill
approximation. Overall, the calculated polycrystalline
elastic moduli, sound wave velocities and Debye temper-
ature of MF are lower than the layered nitrogen rich alkali
and alkaline-earth metal azide salts.57 Furthermore, the
stiﬀness of lattice and bond parameters can be clearly
understand by analyzing the nature of chemical bonding
for the investigated compound.

D. Electronic structure and chemical bonding

Silver and Mercury fulminates are iso-electronic with
the corresponding azides, cyanates, and cynamides. Iqbal
et al2 accomplished a detailed study on electronic struc-
ture and stability of inorganic fulminates, which reveals
that nature of the bond between metal and carbon atoms
is ionic in sodium, potassium and thallous fulminates
whereas it is covalent in silver and mercury fulminate
salts and this will be further reﬂected in their order of
stability. Iqbal et al58 also proposed that the heavy metal
based salts are unstable than light metal salts because of
the asymmetric inter ionic distances. In addition, X-ray
electron spectroscopy study59 on inorganic azides reveals
that heavy metal azides are unstable than alkali metal
azides due to their directional bonding nature. There-
fore, the investigation of electronic structure and chem-

ical bonding is vital to understand the stability of the
energetic materials.

From theoretical perspective, electronic structure cal-
culations for silver and mercury fulminate salts are lack-
ing in the literature. Since SO plays a signiﬁcant role for
heavy metals, in the present work, we have attempted
a comparative analysis of electronic structure between
SF and MF including SO interactions. In analogy to the
Zeeman eﬀect, when an electron moves in an electric ﬁeld
E, it experiences a magnetic ﬁeld Bef f ∼ E × p
mc2 in its
rest-frame (where m, p and c are mass, momentum of an
electron and speed of light, respectively)-a ﬁeld that in-
duces a momentum-dependent Zeeman energy called the
SO coupling, ˆHSO ∼ µB (E × p)σ/mc2, where σ is the
vector of the Pauli spin matrices and µB (= 9.27 × 1024
JT−1) is the Bohr magneton. In crystals, the electric ﬁeld
is given by the gradient of the crystal potential E = -∇V,
which produces a SO ﬁeld w(p) = -µB(∇V × p)/mc2.60
We ﬁrst optimized the fractional co-ordinates of both SF
and MF at the experimental lattice constants17,61 within
PBE-GGA using FP-LAPW method and are presented in
Table III. The calculated band gaps are found to be 2.13
and 3.64 eV for SF and MF respectively at the PBE-
GGA level. The PBE-GGA band gap value is slightly
higher than LDA value of 2.0 eV47 for SF. The obtained
TB-mBJ band gap values for SF and MF are found to
be 3.32 and 4.92 eV respectively. When SO is included,
the TB-mBJ band gaps are found to be 3.30 and 4.82
eV for SF and MF, respectively and the corresponding
reduction in the band gap values after inclusion of SO
are 0.02 and 0.1 eV. The small reduction in the band
gap values are due to occurrence of SO splitting at the
lower part of the valence band (VB) for SF (between -2
to -4 eV) and for MF (between -4.5 to -7 eV). The ob-
tained TB-mBJ band gap values with SO are lowered by
0.7 eV for SF and increased by 0.42 eV for MF when
compared to the optical energy gap measurements2 of
4.0 and 4.4 eV for SF and MF, respectively. However,
wrong space group has been used for MF (which results
a bent molecular structure of MF, which is in contrast to
the recent experimental measurements.17) in the optical
and spectroscopic measurements.2,14 We have calculated
band structures of both the compounds without and with
SO coupling as presented in ﬁgures 5a (5d) and 5b (5e)
for SF (MF), respectively. For clear understanding, we
have also plotted the band structures without and with
SO on top of each other as displayed in ﬁgures 5c & f.
As illustrated in ﬁgure 5, SF and MF are indirect band
gap insulators along S-(Γ-Z) and R-Γ directions, respec-
tively. To a large extent the band structures of both the
compounds look essentially similar with and without SO
except for few bands in the lower part of the VB which are
split due to the SO interactions as shown in the ﬁgures
5c & f. There are few energetically low lying bands, three
for SF and ﬁve for MF (see ﬁgure 1 of the supplementary
material64). In case of SF, the lowest bands in the VB
region are derived from s-states of C, p-states of O atoms
and the bands are positioned around -10 eV. The mid-

5

dle bands are due to s, p-states of fulminate group and
ﬁnally the top of VB is mainly dominated by p-states
of fulminate group, d-states of Ag atom and SO split-
ting is mainly due to 4d-states of Ag atom. Especially,
the bands along the high symmetry directions between
U to R are split due to SO coupling for SF. While in
case of MF, the lowest lying bands around -10 eV are
due to d-states of Hg and s-states of C atoms and the
s, p-states of fulminate group are positioned around -7.8
eV. The middle bands are derived from s, p-states of C,
N, O atoms and 5d-states of Hg atom, which are split
due to SO in the energy range between -4.5 to -7.0 eV
and the similar kind of splitting is seen for 5d-bands of
Hg atom in case of red-HgI2.62 The bands around -2.5 eV
are dominated by d, s-states of Hg atom and ﬁnally the
top valence bands are mainly due to p-states fulminate
group. From the calculated electronic band structures
with and without SO, it is found that inclusion of SO is
more signiﬁcant for 4d and 5d-bands of Ag and Hg atoms
in the energy range -2 to -4 eV and -4.5 to -7 eV for SF
and MF, respectively as depicted in ﬁgure 5c & f.

Further, the intrinsic characteristics of chemical bond-
ing in SF and MF was investigated by examining the total
and partial density of states (PDOS). We have plotted
the PDOS of SF and MF with and without SO as de-
picted in ﬁgure 6. As illustrated in ﬁgure 6, the conduc-
tion band is mainly due to p-states of C, N, O and s, p, d-
states of metal (Ag/Hg) atoms. The lowest lying states
positioned between -4.5 to -7.0 eV are due to hybridiza-
tion of predominantly 5d-sates of Hg which are split due
to SO and anionic p-sates of C, N and O atoms in MF
whereas less contribution arises from Ag-4d states for SF
in this energy range. The states at -2.5 eV below Fermi
energy are derived from 5d and 6s-states of Hg atom. The
top of the valence band is mainly dominated by fulminate
group (more contribution from 2p-states of oxygen atom)
in both of the compounds SF and MF while 4d-states of
Ag atom are predominant in case of SF but very less con-
tribution from 5d-states of Hg atom in case of MF. This
implies that there exists a strong hybridization between
Ag and C when compared to Hg and C atoms. This does
strongly suggest that Ag-C bond has more directional
bonding nature over Hg-C bond which indicates that SF
is more unstable than MF. Moreover, we also observe s, p-
states of fulminate group and d-states of metal atom are
dominant in the VB and strong hybridization between
Ag/Hg and C, N and O atoms of anionic group which
shows the covalent nature in the studied compounds in
contrast to the ionic fulminates. The N-O, C-N, Ag-C
and Hg-C bonds show less compressibility behavior with
increasing pressure (see ﬁgure 3), this is due to strong hy-
bridization between (Hg/Ag)-d and s, p-states of C, N,
and O atoms leads to strong covalent character. Further-
more, this can be clearly analyzed from electronic charge
density maps which are used for accurate description of
chemical bonds. The calculated electron charge density
maps along various crystallographic planes of MF using

anisotropic bonding interactions and the charge cloud is
distributed within the CNO molecule indicating covalent
character as previously reported for SF.47 Overall, the C,
N, and O atoms are covalently bonded within CNO group
and the metal atom is also covalently bonded with CNO
group through C atom in both SF and MF compounds.
The presence of covalent bonding in SF and MF makes
them more sensitive than the ionic fulminates. There-
fore, the heavy metal fulminates can ﬁnd applications as
initiators for secondary explosives due to their instabil-
ity (high sensitivity) which arises from the structure and
bonding nature of the materials.

IV. OPTICAL PROPERTIES

Investigation of optical properties for energetic mate-
rials is interesting because the knowledge of optical con-
stants is useful for determining decomposition mecha-
nism, laser-augmented combustion and ignition. The op-
tical spectra also allow an estimation of surface reﬂection
losses and spatial distribution of radiation absorption.63
Moreover, electronic structure calculations could provide
an information about the nature and location of inter
In our previous work,47
band transitions in crystals.
we made a detailed analysis of optical spectra of SF-
polymorphs without inclusion of SO. In the present
study, we mainly focused on the optical spectra of centro-
symmetric orthorhombic structures of SF and MF with
and without inclusion of SO interactions. The complex
dielectric function ǫ(ω) = ǫ1(ω) + iǫ2(ω) can be used
to describe the linear response of the system to elec-
tromagnetic radiation which is related to interaction of
photons with electrons. The imaginary part of dielec-
tric function ǫ2(ω) is obtained from the momentum ma-
trix elements between the occupied and unoccupied wave
functions within selection rules. The orthorhombic sym-
metry of SF and MF allows three non-zero components
of the dielectric tensors along [100], [010] and [001] di-
rections. The calculated real ǫ1(ω) and imaginary ǫ2(ω)
parts of dielectric function with and without inclusion of
SO are as displayed in ﬁgure 2 of supplementary mate-
rial for SF64 and in ﬁgure 8 for MF. The major peaks in
ǫ2(ω) of SF are mainly arises due to optical transitions
between Ag(4d) → N(2p) states.47 The prominent peaks
in ǫ2(ω) for MF are as follows: the peak at 5.9 eV orig-
inates from the transition O(2p) → Hg(s), the peak at
around 8.0 eV arises probably from the transition Hg(6s)
→ N(p), the peaks in the energy range 10-16 eV are from
the transition Hg(5d) → N/C/O(p) and ﬁnally the peaks
around 19.5 eV are due to the transition between Hg(5d)
→ Hg(p) states along three crystallographic directions.

The ǫ1(ω) can be derived from the ǫ2(ω) using the
Kramer-Kronig relations. The calculated real static di-
electric constant along three crystallographic directions
with (without) SO are found to be 2.00 (2.34), 5.39
(5.56), 2.64 (2.96) for SF and 1.83 (2.09), 5.11 (5.21),
1.99 (2.26) for MF. Using ǫ1(ω) and ǫ2(ω), one can derive

6

other important optical constants such as refraction, re-
ﬂectivity, absorption and photo conductivity of the mate-
rials. The calculated static refractive indices with (with-

out) SO using the dielectric function n = pǫ(0) are given

by n100 = 1.41 (1.53), n010 = 2.32 (2.36), n001 = 1.62
(1.72) for SF and n100 = 1.35 (1.45), n010 = 2.26 (2.28),
n001 = 1.41 (1.50) for MF. Iqbal et al2 proposed that
high values for the refractive index suggest that direc-
tional bonding might be present in the crystal. The au-
thors also observed high refractive index value for SF
over MF when the direction of light was parallel to a-
axis. From the calculated refractive indices of both of
the compounds, we clearly see that SF has high refrac-
tive indices along all the crystallographic directions than
MF. Apart from the PDOS, the polarized refractive in-
dices also show that SF has more covalent character when
compared to MF which implies that SF is more unsta-
ble than MF. Also, the obtained refractive indices are
distinct in all three crystallographic directions, which in-
dicates the anisotropy of the SF (see ﬁgures 3 of sup-
plementary material)64 and for MF (see ﬁgure 9 (top)).
As illustrated in ﬁgure 9 (bottom), the calculated reﬂec-
tivity spectra show that the reﬂectivity starts at around
2 % and reaches to a maximum reﬂectivity of 12-14 %
along a- (at around 16 eV) and c (at around 4 eV for
SF and 16 eV for MF)-directions whereas it starts at
around 15 % and reaches to a maximum value of 50 %
at around 7 and 9 eV along b-direction for both of the
compounds. This implies that SF and MF has maximum
reﬂectivity along b-direction when compared to a- and
c-directions. The calculated absorption spectra is shown
in ﬁgure 4 of supplementary material for SF64 and ﬁgure
10 for MF and absorption starts after the energy 3.30
and 4.82 eV for SF and MF, respectively which is the
energy band gap between the VB maximum and Con-
duction band minimum. The absorption coeﬃcients are
found to have order of magnitude ∼ 107m−1 which shows
that absorption of the compounds lie in the Ultra-Violet
(UV) region. Photo conductivity is due to the increase in
the number of free carriers when photons are absorbed.
The calculated photo conductivity shows a wide photo
current response in the absorption region of 3.30-25 eV
and 4.82-25 eV as shown in ﬁgure 4 of supplementary ma-
terial and ﬁgure 10 for SF and MF, respectively. Overall,
we observe that inclusion of SO interactions has signif-
icant inﬂuence on optical properties of the heavy metal
energetic SF (see ﬁgures 2, 3 and 4 of the supplementary
material64) and MF salts as shown in ﬁgures 8, 9 and
10. Also, SF and MF show a strong anisotropic and wide
range of absorption. This results suggest the possible de-
composition of SF/MF into Ag/Hg, CO and N2 under
the action of UV light. Therefore, SF/MF decompose
under the action of UV light and they may explode due
to photochemical decomposition.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, ab-initio calculations have been per-
formed to understand the pressure dependent structural
and elastic properties of long standing primary explo-
sive, MF. Non-empirical van der Waals density functional
methods vdW-DF, optB88-vdW and optB86b-vdW re-
produce the experimental volume within ∼ 1.7%. Among
the non-local correction methods tested, optB88-vdW
method works well for the examined compound. MF is
found to be softer than the well known primary explo-
sives SF, SA and LA. The lattice constant b increases
whereas lattice constants a, c are decreasing with pres-
sure which shows anisotropic compressibility of MF. The
calculated linear compressibility and elastic moduli re-
veal that MF is more sensitive to detonation along c-
axis. The Hg...O non-bonded interactions are responsible
for high compressibility of MF along c-axis. The semi-
local TB-mBJ potential has been used to calculate the
electronic structure and optical properties including SO
interactions. The computed electronic structures show
that the investigated compounds are indirect band gap
insulators. We also noticed that SO is more pronounced
for 4d and 5d-states of Ag and Hg atoms of SF and
MF, respectively. The nature of chemical bonding is an-
alyzed through the calculated partial density of states

and charge density maps. The covalent nature might
be the reason for more sensitiveness to external stimuli
of heavy metal fulminates when compared to ionic fulmi-
nates. The eﬀect of SO coupling on the optical properties
is found to be signiﬁcant for both of the compounds. The
most probabilistic electric-dipole transitions are found to
occur between Ag(4d) → N(2p) states for SF whereas
O(2p) → Hg(s), Hg(6s) → N(p) and Hg(5d) → Hg(p)
states for MF. The calculated absorption coeﬃcients are
found to be in the order of 107m−1 which shows that SF
and MF are found to decompose under the irradiation of
UV light.
