On SYM theory and all order Bulk Singularity

Abstract

The complete form of the S-matrix elements of three supersymmetric Yang-
Mills (SYM), namely a transverse scalar ﬁeld, two world volume gauge ﬁelds
and a Potential Cn−1 Ramond-Ramond (RR) form ﬁeld has been investigated.
Basically, in order to ﬁnd out an inﬁnite number of t, s, (t + s + u) channel bulk

singularity structures of that particular mixed closed-open amplitude, we em-
ploy all the conformal ﬁeld theory techniques to < VC−2Vφ0VA0VA0 > and explore
all the entire correlation functions as well as all order α′ contact interactions
of these SYM couplings. The comparisons with the other symmetric analysis
< VC−1Vφ0VA−1VA0 > and < VC−1Vφ−1VA0VA0 > are also carried out in detail.
Various couplings from pull-Back of branes, Myers terms and several general-
ized Bianchi identities should be taken into account to be able to reconstruct all

order α′ bulk singularities of type IIB(IIA) superstring theory. Finally, we make
a comment on how to derive without any ambiguity all order α′ contact terms

of those elements of the S-matrix that carry momentum of RR in all involving
transverse directions as well.

Introduction

The non-perturbative and very fundamental objects in both type IIA and IIB superstring
theories are called Dp-branes which have been ﬁrst recognized in [1] and their role is being
highlighted with many diﬀerent issues, most speciﬁcally by area of theoretical high energy
physics [2].

As originally was pointed out Dp-branes do involve (p + 1)-dimensional world volume
directions and can be embedded such as hypersurfaces in all the entire ten dimensional ﬂat
empty space, meanwhile various boundary conditions , like Neumann or Dirichlet could be

inserted to them.

The eﬀective action of multiple Dp-branes embedding the commutator of transverse
scalar ﬁelds was achieved in [3] and making use of the direct mixture of open-closed scat-
tering amplitudes with some reasonable ﬁeld contents the generalisation of that action

with all order α′ corrections was obtained in [4]. Note that some anomalous couplings on
D-branes and the phenomena branes within branes have been already mentioned in [5].

Based on doing direct Conformal Field Theory techniques (CFT) and scattering am-

plitude methods in [6] several other couplings have been recently discovered. It was also
shown that for almost all higher point functions of string amplitudes, none of the standard

ways at the level of Eﬀective Field Theory (EFT) ( such as pull-back of branes, Myers
Terms and Taylor expansions) can be applied to actually produce the S-matrix of string

theory amplitudes.

The applications to some of the new couplings would be ﬁrst to get to either AdS or dS
solutions , secondly obtaining some kind of realization of the entropy of various systems,
most notably, the phenomenon of N 3 for M5 branes [7].

Some important remarks for supersymmetrized version of the action were introduced in

[8]. Indeed only the part of the action that does embed symmetric trace of non-Abelian ﬁeld
contents has been ﬁgured out. In [9] the action for single bosonic brane was advised and

eventually in [10] the supersymmetric part of the action was derived. Notice that various
remarks for the eﬀective actions of brane anti brane systems including their bulk structures

have also been revealed [11]. It is worth pointing out that most of RR couplings are derived
through concrete the mixture of closed-BPS or non-BPS open strings [12]. To elaborate on
all parts of the eﬀective actions and to focus on all parts of Chern-Simons, Wess-Zumino

and DBI, we just hint out to [13].

1

The construction of the paper is as follows. Although in an important paper [14] the way
of dealing with PCO’s has been extensively explained but we still ﬁnd it so sophisticated to
apply its construction to higher point functions of the mixed closed C-scalar ﬁeld operators,

hence in the next section we explicitly construct out all the closed forms of the correlators
in an asymmetric picture of the S-matrix < VC−2Vφ0VA0VA0 >( where the superscripts
indicate the related picture of strings). Later for the concreteness, we demonstrate the
ultimate S-matrix elements in two other symmetric pictures of < VC−1Vφ−1VA0VA0 > and
< VC−1Vφ0VA−1VA0 >.

The singularity structures and all order contact term comparisons of this amplitude in

both symmetric picture have been performed in [6], however, in this paper among the other
things, we ﬁrst ﬁnd out the complete form of the S-matrix in asymmetric picture then carry
out the comparisons of all singularity structures as well as contact terms within detail even

with asymmetric picture.

Notice that due to the presence of all new terms that actually carry momentum of RR in

transverse directions, including very explicitly all p.ξ terms in the closed and ultimate form
of the amplitude, we then do ﬁnd out the presence of an inﬁnite number of t, s, (t + s + u)-

channel bulk singularities, as well as u-channel and examine the presence of some new
contact interactions.

Further remarks are in order, namely one has to point out the fact that already at the
world sheet level of a mixed ﬁve point function, and in particular for < C −1φ0A−1A0 >
case , we have been able to explore just some (but certainly not all) of the bulk structures

[6].

Those terms come out of the direct computations , given the fact that all < eip.x(z)∂ixi(x1) >

correlators are no longer zero. Thus one has to take care of all the bulk singularities that
do explicitly involve the momentum of RR in transverse directions. Indeed recently in [15]

it is clearly shown that even by knowing various generalized Bianchi identities for RR, one
still can not discover all the bulk singularities of mixed RR, non-BPS branes in symmetric
picture of S-matrices, while the story gets even more complicated for BPS branes. In fact

by knowing Bianchi identities it is explicitly shown that even for the simplest higher point
functions of the mixed string amplitudes one loses various bulk singularity structures as

well as diﬀerent contact terms.
Indeed the S-matrix has the potential of producing not
only the structures of new couplings of string theory but also ﬁxing precisely all order α′

2

corrections with all their exact coeﬃcients , therefore for mixed RR and transverse scalar
ﬁelds it is recommended to have the complete form of the S-matrix analysis in asymmetric
picture as well and then start analyzing in detail all the singularity structures. Evidently

in various S-matrices, it has also been observed that even the structures of some of the new
couplings can only be ﬁgured out by direct S-matrix analysis.

2 The < C −2φ0A0A0 > S-matrix

Let us start oﬀ by making some general observation that has been seen at world-sheet level.

One might wonder about the deep relation of both open and closed strings.
In fact we
claim that this relationship has been widely understood once we try to match up all the

string singularities with their eﬀective ﬁeld theory poles.
In [16] based on various BPS
and non-BPS ﬁve point functions , we have made a universal conjecture of exploring all
order α′ corrections to SYM couplings that came out of reconstructing either tachyonic or

massless poles of all inﬁnite (t + s + u)-channel poles , where having an RR coupling with
either a tachyon or scalar ﬁeld ( gauge ﬁeld) does play the major role in coinciding all the

singularities of both string and ﬁeld theory.

We now start this section by introducing the notations in which for the entire space-time

we will deal with µ, ν = 0, 1, ..., 9 and world volume spaces are illustrated by b, c = 0, 1, ..., p
whereas transverse directions carried by i, j = p + 1, ..., 9 indices. Note that due to the
appearance of the momentum of RR in transverse directions, one cannot apply T-duality
to ten dimensional ﬂat space of the S-matrix of < VCVAVAVA > to get to complete form of
< VCVφVAVA > S-matrix elements ( further explanations have been given in [17],[18]).

Our computations are consist of the following vertex operators:

φ (x1) = ξ1i(cid:18)∂X i(x1) + α′ik·ψψi(x1)(cid:19)eα′ik·X(x1),
V (0)
A (x2) = ξ2a(cid:18)∂X a(x2) + α′iq·ψψa(x2)(cid:19)eα′iq·X(x2),

We also use some kinematic relations as

k2 = q2 = p2 = 0 q.ξ1 = k.ξ1 = q.ξ2 = 0,

where the RR vertex in asymmetric picture has been found in [19] and later in [20]. One
might be also interested in considering some of the results of direct string amplitude com-
putations [21]. To deal with just holomorphic world-sheet ﬁelds, we have also applied the

so called doubling trick and for all other notations, we suggest [6] as well as the Appendix
of [13].2

The S-matrix elements of a transverse scalar ﬁeld, two world volume gauge ﬁelds and
one closed string C-ﬁeld at disk level can be explored by evaluating all the correlators
< V
A (x3) > for which all the three open strings are inserted
in zero picture meanwhile the closed string RR is written in terms of its potential in an

asymmetric picture.

First of all we try to extract the whole S-matrix and divide it out to various correlators

to indeed simplify the analysis.

To investigate all fermionic correlation functions, involving diverse numbers of currents
and also fermion ﬁelds in diﬀerent positions and to get to the gauge invariant amplitude, one

needs to employ the so called generalized Wick-like rule which has been more emphasized
in [22]. Let us ﬁnd the compact form of the S-matrix elements 3

Substituting the above correlators in the closed form of the S-matrix and simplifying
further, one may ﬁnd the amplitude is SL(2,R) invariant and the volume of conformal killing

group has been removed by ﬁxing three position of open strings at zero, one and inﬁnity,
that is x1 = 0, x2 = 1, x3 → ∞.

Now one must come over the evaluation of all the integrals on the location of closed

string RR on upper half plane. The integrals can be computed only in terms of Gamma
functions where one needs to employ the following sort of integrations on upper half plane

Z d2z|1 − z|a|z|b(z − ¯z)c(z + ¯z)d

where a, b, c are written just in terms of Mandelstam variable and for d = 0, 1, 2 the results

are obtained in [23] and [13] appropriately. We hold the the following deﬁnitions for all
three Mandelstam variables

Having done all the integrations properly , one ﬁnally reads oﬀ all the elements of our string

One can simplify the S-matrix further. Indeed the 5th term A1 of (6) can be precisely
cancelled out by the second term of A63, likewise the 5th term of A3 is removed by the 2nd
term A88. Notice that the 1st and 2nd terms A42 are cancelled oﬀ by the 1st and 3rd terms
of A87 accordingly, where as the 1st and 2nd terms of A72 are removed by contributions of
the 3rd and 1st terms of A86 appropriately.

Let us work out with RR in terms of its ﬁeld strength while keeping track of scalar ﬁeld
at zero picture. The S-matrix elements of < VC−1Vφ0VA−1VA0 > or the so called S-matrix
elements in symmetric picture to all orders in α′ has already been found in [6] to be

Finally if we deal with RR in terms of its ﬁeld strength and just change the picture
of scalar ﬁeld then the S-matrix elements < VC−1Vφ−1VA0VA0 > to all orders in α′ can be

explored in [17] as follows

where all the singularity structures and contact interaction comparisons of both sym-
metric pictures have already been done in [6]. To be able to explore all the bulk singularity

structures, in the following sections we try to compare all order α′ singularity structures of
BPS strings in symmetric and asymmetric picture and afterwards we carry out the anal-

ysis at the level of contact terms to see whether or not some supersymmetric Yang-Mills
couplings have been overlooked, and if so how to ﬁnd them out.

3 All order Singularity Comparisons between asym-

metric and < VC−1Vφ0VA−1VA0 > elements

In this section, we ﬁrst reconstruct all the singularity structures of < VC−1Vφ0VA−1VA0 > by
dealing with < VC−2Vφ0VA0VA0 > S-matrix.

If we add the 1st terms of A3 and A88 of asymmetric picture (6), we then obtain the

following terms

− 2istk1eTr (P−C/ (n−1)MpΓei)ξ1iξ2.ξ3L1

Now one needs to actually consider the sum of the above term with the 2nd terms of
A86, A87 accordingly to gain the following term

− 2ist(k1 + k2 + k3)cTr (P−C/ (n−1)MpΓci)ξ1iξ2.ξ3L1

9

where we apply the momentum conservation to above term to immediately reveal the fact
that this term is indeed the ﬁrst term A5 of symmetric picture in (8).

Likewise, we need to add up the 2nd terms of A3, A43 and the 3rd term A72 in (6) to

be able to derive

− 4iu(k1 + k2 + k3)cTr (P−C/ (n−1)MpΓic)ξ1ik1.ξ2k1.ξ3L1

which is the the 3rd term A5 of (8). If we also add the last terms of A72, A87 and the

3rd term A3 of asymmetric result , we then get to

4it(k1 + k2 + k3)cTr (P−C/ (n−1)MpΓic)ξ1ik1.ξ3k3.ξ2L1

which is the the 2nd term A5 of symmetric picture. Eventually, by adding up the fourth
terms of A3, A86 and the 1st term A43 of asymmetric result , we explore the last term A5
of (8) as follows.

4is(k1 + k2 + k3)cTr (P−C/ (n−1)MpΓic)ξ1ik1.ξ2k2.ξ3L1.

Note that the 1st term A5 of (6), produces exactly the ﬁrst term A3 of (8) and by
applying momentum conservation to the last term A62 , apart from reconstructing the last
term A4 of (8) , we generate the 2nd term A6 of (8) as well.

Applying k2c = −(k1 + k3 + p)c to both terms A41 and to the 2nd term A83 of (6) as well
as keeping in mind the antisymmetric property of ǫ tensor , not only both terms A2 of (8)
but also its 2nd term A3 (of symmetric amplitude) are precisely reconstructed, meanwhile
the extra terms , coming from momentum conservation can be precisely cancelled out where
the 2nd term A84 is also taken into account.

Having applied momentum conservation to the 3rd term A62 of (6), one would ﬁnd the

following term

− 2k3.ξ2ip.ξ1Tr (P−C/ (n−1)MpΓba)(tsL2)ξ3b(k1 + p + k3)a

(12)

where the 1st term in (12) produces the 2nd term A4 of (8), and its second term generates
the 1st term A6 of (8) and essentially its 3rd term will be cancelled by the 2nd term A5 of
asymmetric amplitude (8).

4 All order Bulk Singularity structures of < VC−2Vφ0VA0VA0 >

We start oﬀ to scrutinize, basically we consider the other terms in the S-matrix in (6) that
have not been taken into account yet. To deal with those terms, we need to add up the
ﬁrst terms A1, A63 of asymmetric picture to get to the following elements

− 2stip.ξ1ξ2.ξ3Tr (P−C/ (n−1)Mp)L1

One just needs to relate the above term to the other terms that have been left over in
A1 of asymmetric picture (6) (all its terms except its 5th term), to eventually explore new
bulk singularities of asymmetric picture (6) as follows

Let us construct all these new (s + t + u)- channel bulk singularity structures in an eﬀective
ﬁeld theory, where L1’s expansion with all the coeﬃcients of the expansion have been given
in [6]. We extract the trace and just focus on the part of the expansion that involves all

(20)

In order to show that we have explored all order (t+s+u)-channel bulk singularities, we

just remove the common factors and start comparing both string and ﬁeld theory amplitudes
of (14) and (20) at each order of α′ accordingly.

At zeroth order for n = m = 0, the EFT amplitude (20) produces the following coeﬃ-
cient −4(a0,0 + b0,0) = π2 whereas the string amplitude (14) regenerate (2π2c0,0) = π2. At
1st order (20) will be led to −(a1,0 + a0,1 + b1,0 + b0,1)(s + t) = 0 , on the other hand string
amplitude does carry π2(c1,0 + c0,1)(s + t) = 0. Finally at (α′)2 order, (20) predicts the
coeﬃcient −4(a1,1 + b1,1)st − 2(a0,2 + a2,0 + b0,2 + b2,0)[s2 + t2] = π4
3 (s2 + t2) and
string amplitude is equivalent to π2[c1,1(2st) + (c2,0 + c0,2)(s2 + t2)], which is precisely given
by EFT coeﬃcients. One might head oﬀ to get the same results at all orders of α′ (see [17]
for (α′)3, (α′)4 comparisons).

3 (st) + π4

Hence the outlook of this section which was producing all order (t + s + u) channel bulk
singularity structures , has been exactly achieved. Let us concentrate on the other bulk

singularity structures.

4.2 An inﬁnite number of t, s-channel Bulk Singularity Structures

Let us proceed with the 2nd terms A71, A82 of asymmetric picture (6) and apply momentum
conservation to (k3 + p)a = −(k1 + k2)a to those terms to obtain

2ik1.ξ2suL2ξ3bξ1ik3dTr (P−C/ (n−1)MpΓbdai)(p + k3)a

(21)

in above the second term evidently has zero contribution to S-matrix , given the fact that
the whole (21) is symmetric under exchanging k3d, k3a and simultaneously is antisymmetric
under ǫ tensor so the result for the 2nd term of (21) is zero, but its ﬁrst term does include

an inﬁnite number of t-channel singularities. Indeed these t-channel singularities are the

13

same poles that have been shown up in the 1st terms A2 of (10) and A3 of (8) where these
t-channel poles have already been produced in [17] as well.

However, the point of this section is that, besides those, this S-matrix does include an

inﬁnite t-channel bulk singularities as well which we just demonstrate them right now. It
it is also important to highlight the fact that the 1st term A5 of asymmetric amplitude (6)
is a new sort of new bulk singularity structure

− 2iusk1.ξ2k3dξ3bp.ξ1Tr (P−C/ (n−1)MpΓbd)L2

(22)

which has an inﬁnite number of t-channel bulk singularity structures that we reconstruct
them out now. Note that due to symmetries (as can be seen later on), the amplitude is

antisymmetric under exchanging either 2 ↔ 3 or t ↔ s, therefore we just regenerate all inﬁ-
nite t-channel bulk singularities and ﬁnally by changing all the momenta and polarizations

of two gauge ﬁelds one can produce all s-channel bulk poles as well.

Inserting just singularity contributions of usL2 expansion to (22), one ﬁnds out all
inﬁnite t-channel bulk singularities (where (π)1/2µp is supposed to be normalization constant
of the amplitude)

where V j

β (φ, A3, φ1) has to be obtained from scalar ﬁelds ’s kinetic term in DBI eﬀective
action and as has been pointed out all the kinetic terms have already been set in the sense
that they will not receive any α′ corrections. Therefore to investigate all inﬁnite t-channel

bulk singularity structures we just impose all order corrections to the following mixing

(29)

which are precisely the bulk singularities that have been pointed out in (23) and we were
able to ﬁnd them out in the eﬀective theory as well.

Finally let us deal with all s- channel bulk singularities. We need to actually consider
the sum of the ﬁrst term A41 with the 2nd term A83 of (6) and make use of momentum
conservation along the world volume of brane (k1 + k3)e = −(k2 + p)e to derive the following
term

− 2iutk1.ξ3Tr (P−C/ (n−1)MpΓacei)ξ1iξ2ak2c(k2 + p)eL2

(30)

where its ﬁrst term evidently has zero contribution to S-matrix, because the whole (30) is
symmetric under exchanging k2c, k2e and also is antisymmetric under ǫ tensor so the result
for the ﬁrst term of (30) is zero, but its second term (pC = H) involves inﬁnite numbers
of s-channel singularities which are precisely the 2nd term A3 of (10) and these s-channel
poles have been produced in [17].4

4On the other hand, applying the following Bianchi identity

ξ1iξ2a(cid:18)ǫa0...ap−2dapdH i

a0...ap−2 + piǫa0...ap−1aHa0...ap−1(cid:19) = 0

15

It is also worth emphasising the important point that the 1st term A2 of asymmetric

amplitude (6) is now some sort of new bulk singularity structure as follows

2iutk1.ξ3k2cξ2ap.ξ1Tr (P−C/ (n−1)MpΓac)L2

(32)

that can be re-derived in an EFT as illustrated for an inﬁnite number of t-channel bulk

poles in this section.

4.3 An inﬁnite number of u-channel singularities

In this section, we try to add up the 2nd terms A62, A2 of (6) and insert momentum
conservation along the brane to get to the following terms

− itsp.ξ1(2k2.ξ3)Tr (P−C/ (n−1)MpΓac)L2ξ2a(−p − k1)c

(33)

where the ﬁrst term in (33) reconstructs the 2nd term A7 of symmetric amplitude (8) and
its second term remains to be explored as an extra u-channel pole. Adding the 1st terms
A71, A85 of (6), we derive the following u-channel bulk singularities

2ik3.ξ2tsL2ξ3bξ1ik1eTr (P−C/ (n−1)MpΓbdie)(p + k1)d

(34)

Clearly its second term has no contribution to the S-matrix at all, because the whole (34)
is symmetric under exchanging k1d, k1e and simultaneously is antisymmetric under ǫ tensor,
so the result is zero , but its ﬁrst term does include an inﬁnite number of new u-channel
bulk singularities, which will be generated in an eﬀective ﬁeld theory in the following. Also
the 2nd term A85 of (6) has to be taken as follows

2iξ2.ξ3stL2Tr (P−C/ (n−1)MpΓbcie)k1eξ1ik2ck3b

(35)

which has contribution to an inﬁnite number of u-channel gauge poles as well. We now

collect all the above terms, extract the traces and write down all u-channel poles as

and considering the sum of the 1st term of A2, the 2nd term of A3 and 1st term of A7 of (8) will give rise
the same s-channel singularities as follows:

where k is now the momentum of oﬀ-shell gauge ﬁeld ka = −(k2+k3)a = (p+k1)a. Replacing
(39) and (38) into (37) , we would be able to reconstruct all order u-channel gauge ﬁeld
poles of string amplitude (36) as well.

Finally let us go through comparisons of all order α′ contact interactions in both sym-

metric and asymmetric pictures of this S-matrix.

5 Contact terms

First of all, the 1st term A62 of (6) precisely produces the 1st term A4 of (8). Consider A81 of
(6) and apply momentum conservation along the world volume of brane k2c = −(p+k1+k3)c
to this term, by doing so, making use of the property of antisymmetric ǫ tensor and the fact
that pC = H, one is able to produce the ﬁrst contact term A1 of symmetric picture in (8).

17

Finally to regenerate the last contact term of symmetric picture which is the 2nd term A1 of
(8) , one needs to apply once more the momentum conservation k2c = −(p + k1 + k3)c to A61
of asymmetric analysis in (6) and use the antisymmetric property of ǫ tensor, meanwhile

this leads to a new sort of bulk contact interaction as follows:

4iTr (P−C/ (n−1)MpΓdbac)ξ2aξ3bp.ξ1k3dk1cL1(−t − s − u)

Ultimately considering the sum of the 1st terms A82, A83, A84 of asymmetric picture in

(6), takes us to another sort of new contact interaction which has the following structure

ipdTr (P−C/ (n−1)MpΓbdai)ξ1iξ2aξ3bustL2

Note that the above term is antisymmetric under interchanging the gauge ﬁelds. The way
of ﬁnding all order α′ higher derivative corrections to BPS string amplitudes has been
explained in sections 4,5 of [6] and to shorten the paper we just refer the interested reader

to those concrete remarks and explanations of section of [6]. Indeed one could easily follow
it out and start to generate these contact interactions to all orders as well. This ends all

our goals of this paper.

Last but not least it would be interesting to see what will happen to the other asymmetric

higher point functions of the mixed C-ﬁeld, even numbers of transverse scalars and at least
a gauge ﬁeld of string theory amplitudes. We hope to come over this problem as well as

various other issues including the beautiful mathematical structures behind string theory
amplitudes in near future.
