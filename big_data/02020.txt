Prony’s method on the sphere

Stefan Kunis†‡

H. Michael M¨oller§

Ulrich von der Ohe†

Eigenvalue analysis based methods are well suited for the reconstruction of ﬁnitely
supported measures from their moments up to a certain degree. We give a precise
description when Prony’s method succeeds in terms of an interpolation condi-
tion. In particular, this allows for the unique reconstruction of a measure from
its trigonometric moments whenever its support is separated and also for the re-
construction of a measure on the unit sphere from its moments with respect to
spherical harmonics. Both results hold in arbitrary dimensions and also yield a
certiﬁcate for popular semideﬁnite relaxations of these reconstruction problems.

Key words and phrases : frequency analysis, spectral analysis, exponential sum,
moment problem, super-resolution.

Prony’s method [11], see also e.g. [28, 26], reconstructs the coeﬃcients and distinct parameters

k = 0, . . . , 2M.

The computation of the parameters xj is done by setting up a certain Hankel or Toeplitz
matrix of these moments and computing the roots of the polynomial with the monomial
coeﬃcients given by any non-zero kernel vector of this matrix. Afterwards, the coeﬃcients ˆfj
can be computed by solving a Vandermonde linear system of equations.

We recently generalized this prototypical algorithm to the multivariate case by realizing
the parameters as common roots of d-variate polynomials belonging to the kernel of a certain
multilevel Hankel or Toeplitz matrix [19]. In the present paper, we give a precise description
when the parameters can be identiﬁed in terms of a simple interpolation condition, which
in turn is equivalent to the surjectivity of a certain evaluation homomorphism and also to
the full rank of a certain Vandermonde matrix. Since identiﬁability also implies full rank of

a slightly larger Vandermonde matrix, we end up with a variant of the so called ﬂat exten-
sion property [10, 21]. Beyond this, our characterization with respect to the Vandermonde
matrix allows to derive simple geometric conditions on the parameters: given the order of
the moments is bounded from below by some explicit constant divided by the separation
distance of the parameters, unique reconstruction is guaranteed. In particular, we get rid of
the commonly stated technical condition that the order has to be larger than the number of
parameters and weaken the ‘coordinate wise’ separation condition as used in [22] to a truly
multivariate separation condition. Moreover, studying the Vandermonde-like factorization of
the Hankel-like matrix of moments allows for a transparent generalization to Dirac ensembles
on the sphere where only moments with respect to the spherical harmonics are used for re-
construction. Recently, the considered problem has also been studied as a constrained total
variation minimization problem on the space of measures and attracted quite some attention,
see e.g. [6, 13] and references therein. As a corollary to our results, we give a painless con-
struction of a so-called dual certiﬁcate for the total variation minimization problem on the
d-dimensional torus [7, 8] and on the d-dimensional sphere [5, 4]. Since our construction is
a sum of squares, this construction also bypasses the relaxation from a nonnegative polyno-
mial to the semideﬁnite program which is in general known to possibly increase degrees for
d = 2 and to possibly fail for d > 2, cf. [12, Remark 4.17, Theorem 4.24, and Remark 4.26].
We ﬁnally close by two small numerical examples, postpone a detailed study of stability and
computational times to a future exposition, and give a short summary.

2 Preliminaries
Throughout the paper, K denotes a ﬁeld and d ∈ N denotes a natural number. For x ∈ Kd,
k ∈ Nd
d . We start by deﬁning the object of
our interest, that is, multivariate exponential sums, as a natural generalization of univariate
exponential sums.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A function f : Nd
ˆf1, . . . , ˆfM ∈ K, and pairwise distinct x1, . . . , xM ∈ Kd such that we have

0. In that case M , ˆfj, and xj, j = 1, . . . , M , are uniquely determined, and f is
called M -sparse, the ˆfj are called coeﬃcients of f , and xj are called parameters of f . The
set of parameters of f is denoted by Ω = Ωf := {xj : j = 1, . . . , M}.

Let f : Nd

0 → K be an M -sparse d-variate exponential sum with coeﬃcients ˆfj ∈ K and
parameters xj ∈ Kd, j = 1, . . . , M . Our objective is to reconstruct the coeﬃcients and
parameters of f given a ﬁnite set of samples of f at a subset of Nd

The following notations will be used throughout the paper. For k, n ∈ Nd

0, see also [25].

Next we establish the crucial link between the matrix Hn and the roots of multivariate
polynomials. To this end, let Π := K[X1, . . . , Xd] denote the K-algebra of d-variate polyno-
d ∈ Π \ {0} let deg(p) := max{|k| : pk (cid:54)= 0}. The

For arbitrary V ⊂ Kd, the evaluation homomorphism at V will be denoted by

The connection between the matrix Hn and polynomials that vanish on Ω lies in the obser-
vation that, using Deﬁnition 2.1, the matrix Hn admits the factorization

additional notation. The zero locus of a set P ⊂ Π of polynomials is denoted by

In order to deal with the multivariate polynomials encountered in this way we need some

V(P ) := {x ∈ Kd : p(x) = 0 for all p ∈ P},

that is, V(P ) consists of the common roots of all the polynomials in P . For a set V ⊂ Kd,
the kernel of AV (which is an ideal of Π) will be denoted I(V ) and is called the vanishing
ideal of V ; it consists of all polynomials that vanish on V . Further, let I n(V ) := kerAV
n =
I(V ) ∩ Πn denote the K-sub-vector space of polynomials of degree at most n that vanish on
V . Subsequently, we identify Πn and KN and switch back and forth between matrix-vector
and polynomial notation. In particular, we do not necessarily distinguish between AΩ
n and
its representation matrix An, so that e.g. “V(ker An)” makes sense.

3 Main results

We proceed with a general discussion that the identiﬁability of the parameters and an interpo-
lation at these parameters are almost equivalent. While this is closely related to the so-called
ﬂat extension principle [10, 21], we also give a reﬁnement which is of great use when discussing
the moment problem on the sphere. The second and third subsection study the trigonometric
moment problem and the moment problem on the unit sphere, respectively. In both cases,
appropriate separation conditions guarantee the above mentioned interpolation condition and
thus identiﬁability of the parameters. As a corollary, we give a simple construction of a dual
certiﬁcate for the total variation minimization problem on the d-dimensional torus [7, 8] and
on the d-dimensional sphere [5, 4].

We recall some notions from the theory of Gr¨obner bases which are needed in this section,
see e.g. [3, 17, 9]. A d-variate term is a polynomial of the form X k = X k1
for some
k = (k1, . . . , kd) ∈ Nd
A term order on M is a linear order ≤ on M such that 1 ≤ t for all t ∈ M and t1 ≤ t2
k pkX k ∈ Π\{0} let lt≤(p) :=
set N≤(I) := M \ lt≤(I) is called normal set of I. A term order ≤ is degree compatible if
t1 ≤ t2 implies deg(t1) ≤ deg(t2), or equivalently, if deg(p) = deg(lt≤(p)) for all p ∈ Π \ {0}.
Lemma 3.1 (see e.g. [14, Prop. 2.6]). Let ≤ be a term order on M. If I is an ideal of Π and

implies t1t3 ≤ t2t3 for all t1, t2, t3 ∈ M. For a polynomial p =(cid:80)
max≤(cid:8)X k : pk (cid:54)= 0(cid:9) and for an ideal I (cid:54)= {0} of Π let lt≤(I) := {lt≤(p) : p ∈ I \ {0}}. The
t ∈ N≤(I), then t is the least element of Mt :=(cid:8)lt(p) : p ∈ Π \ {0}, p = t in Π/I(cid:9).
t ≤ lt(p). Without loss of generality we can assume p (cid:54)= t. Thus let t − p =(cid:80)
Case 1: For every k, t (cid:54)= ckX k. Then, since p = t −(cid:80)
t < X m = lt(t −(cid:80)

Proof. Since lt(t) = t, we have t ∈ Mt. Let p ∈ Π \ {0} with p = t in Π/I. We have to show
k ckX k (cid:54)= 0
with ck ∈ K and X m = lt(t − p).

Case 2: There is a k such that t = ckX k. Then ck = 1 and we have t = X k ≤ X m and
since t ∈ N (I) = M \ lt(I) and X m = lt(t − p) ∈ lt(I), we have t < X m. Therefore we have

k ckX k, we have t ≤ lt(p).

k ckX k) = lt(p).

Lemma 3.2. Let ≤ be a degree compatible term order on M. Let Ω ⊂ Kd be ﬁnite and n ∈ N0
such that the evaluation homomorphism AΩ
n : Πn → KΩ is surjective. Then N≤(I(Ω)) ⊂ Πn.
Proof. Since Ω is ﬁnite, I(Ω) (cid:54)= {0}. Let t ∈ N (I(Ω)) and consider t in Π/I(Ω). Since
a∈Ω I(a) and I(a), a ∈ Ω, are pairwise co-prime, by the Chinese remainder theorem
ϕ : Π/I(Ω) → KΩ, p (cid:55)→ (p(a))a∈Ω, is a bijection. Since AΩ
n : Πn → KΩ is surjective, there is
a p ∈ Πn with ϕ(t) = AΩ
n (p) = (p(a))a∈Ω = ϕ(p), hence p = t. Since t /∈ I(Ω), in particular
p (cid:54)= 0. Thus Lemma 3.1 together with the degree compatibility of ≤ implies

I(Ω) =(cid:84)
deg(t) = deg(min(cid:8)lt q : q (cid:54)= 0, q = t in Π/I(Ω)(cid:9)) = min(cid:8)deg(lt q) : q = t(cid:9) ≤ deg(p) ≤ n,

i.e. t ∈ Πn.
Theorem 3.3. Let ∅ (cid:54)= Ω ⊂ Kd be ﬁnite and n ∈ N0 such that AΩ
Then Ω = V(I n+1(Ω)).
Proof. Let ≤ be a degree compatible term order on M and let

n : Πn → KΩ is surjective.

P := {t ∈ lt(I(Ω)) : t |-minimal in lt(I(Ω))} .

We show that P ⊂ Πn+1. Let t ∈ P . Since Ω (cid:54)= ∅, t (cid:54)= 1. Thus t = Xjt(cid:48) for some j ∈ {1, . . . , d}
and t(cid:48) ∈ M. By |-minimality of t in lt(I(Ω)), we have t(cid:48) /∈ lt(I(Ω)). Thus t(cid:48) ∈ N (I(Ω)) which
implies deg(t(cid:48)) ≤ n by Lemma 3.2 and hence deg(t) = deg(Xjt(cid:48)) = deg(Xj) + deg(t(cid:48)) ≤ n + 1,
i.e. t ∈ Πn+1.
By Dickson’s lemma (cf. [3, Thm. 5.2 and Cor. 4.43]), P is ﬁnite. Thus let P = {t1, . . . , tr}
with pairwise diﬀerent tj and g1, . . . , gr ∈ I(Ω) with lt gj = tj. Then G = {g1, . . . , gr} is a
(Gr¨obner) basis for I(Ω) (see e.g. Becker-Weispfenning [3, Prop. 5.38 (iv)]) and deg(gj) =
deg(lt gj) = deg(tj) ≤ n + 1, i.e. G ⊂ I n+1(Ω). In particular Ω ⊂ V(I n+1(Ω)) ⊂ V(G) =
V((cid:104)G(cid:105)) = V(I(Ω)) = Ω, since Ω is ﬁnite (as usual, (cid:104)G(cid:105) denotes the ideal generated by G).

Remark 3.4. In summary, for every subset Ω ⊂ Kd with |Ω| = M ∈ N we have the chain of
implications

rankAΩ

n = M ⇒ Ω = V(I n+1(Ω)) ⇒ rankAΩ

n+1 = M,

where the second implication follows as in the proof of [19, Thm. 3.1]. Moreover note that
the factorization (2.1) and Frobenius’ rank inequality [15, 0.4.5 (e)] implies

2 rankAΩ

n ≤ rank Hn + M ≤ rankAΩ

n + M, n ∈ N,

and thus the equivalence

rank Hn = rank Hn+1 = M ⇔ rankAΩ

n = M,

where the left hand side is exactly the ﬂat extension principle [10, 21]. We would like to
note that considering An allows for signed measures and yields simple a-priori conditions on
the order of the moments, see Lemmata 3.9 and 3.13, while the ﬂat extension principle is
an a-posteriori test and can in particular be used to ﬁnd the possibly unknown number of
parameter M .

The K-vector space ΠV,n is isomorphic to(cid:8)p|V : p ∈ Πn

In order to give a slight reﬁnement of Theorem 3.3 in Corollary 3.6 we need the following
notation. For a set V ⊂ Kd let ΠV := Π/I(V ) and ΠV,n := Πn/I n(V ). The map ΠV →
its induced polynomial function p : Kd → K) is a ring isomorphism. Thus we may identify
the residue class p = p + I(V ) of p ∈ Π with the function p|V : V → K. Since the K-vector
space homomorphism Πn → ΠV , p (cid:55)→ p, has I n(V ) as its kernel, ΠV,n is embedded in ΠV .

V : ΠV → KΩ, p (cid:55)→ AΩ(p), which is well-deﬁned by the above,
and let AΩ

I V,n(Ω) := kerAΩ

V,n denote the restriction of AΩ

Proof. The ﬁrst inclusion is clear. To prove the second inclusion, let a ∈ V V (I V,n(Ω)) and
p ∈ I n(Ω) = kerAΩ
n . We have to show that p(a) = 0. Let p := p + I n(V ). Since p ∈ Πn,
p ∈ Πn/I n(V ) = ΠV,n and we have AΩ
V,n =
I V,n(Ω). Since a ∈ V V (I V,n(Ω)), that is, a ∈ V and q(a) = 0 for all q ∈ I V,n(Ω), it follows
that p(a) = p(a) = 0.

V (p) = AΩ(p) = 0, i.e. p ∈ kerAΩ

V,n(p) = AΩ

Combining this with Theorem 3.3 yields the following.

Corollary 3.6. Let V ⊂ Kd, Ω be a non-empty ﬁnite subset of V and n ∈ N0 such that AΩ
is surjective. Then

V,n

Ω = V V (I V,n+1(Ω)).

Proof. Since AΩ
fore we can apply Theorem 3.3 which together with Lemma 3.5 yields

V,n : ΠV,n → KΩ is surjective, AΩ

n : Πn → KΩ is clearly also surjective. There-

Ω ⊂ V V (I V,n+1(Ω)) ⊂ V(I n+1(Ω)) = Ω.

Now let K = C and restrict to parameters on the d-dimensional torus Td := {z ∈ C : |z| = 1}d
with parameterization Td (cid:51) z = e2πit for a unique t ∈ [0, 1)d. Now, let M ∈ N, coeﬃcients
ˆfj ∈ C\{0}, and pairwise distinct tj ∈ [0, 1)d, j = 1, . . . , M , be given. Then the trigonometric

Remark 3.8. It is tempting to try to prove Lemma 3.7 with n+1 instead of dn+1 analogously
to Theorem 3.3 by using “maxdeg-compatible” term orders instead of degree compatible term
orders. However, for d ≥ 2 there are no such term orders. To see this, let ≤ be a term order on

Remark 3.10. The semi-discrete Ingham inequality [16, Ch. 8] has been made fully discrete
in [27, Lem. 3.1]. Equivalent results are given in [2, 20] as condition number estimates for
Vandermonde matrices. More recently, a sharp condition number estimate for the univariate
case d = 1 has been proven in [23] and a multivariate generalization under ‘coordinate wise
separation’ has been given in [22].
Theorem 3.11. Let f : Zd → C be an M -sparse d-variate exponential sum with parameters
xj ∈ Td, j = 1, . . . , M . If the parameters are q-separated and n > d3/2/q + d + 1, then

Ω = V(ker Tn),

where the entries of the matrix are given by trigonometric moments of order up to n, i.e.,

Tn = (f (k − (cid:96)))k,(cid:96)∈{0,...,n}d ∈ C(n+1)d×(n+1)d

.

Proof. Setting n0 := (cid:98)(n − 1)/d(cid:99) yields n0 >
Thus Ω = V(ker Fn) is guaranteed by Lemma 3.7 and the factorization

d/q and Lemma 3.9 implies full rank of Fn0.

being a variant of (2.1), together with the Frobenius’ rank inequality [15, 0.4.5 (e)]

M = rank F ∗

n D + rank DFn − rank D ≤ rank Tn ≤ rank Fn = M,

implies ker Fn = ker Tn from which the assertion follows.

This improves over [19, Thm. 3.1, 3.7] by getting rid of the technical condition n ≥ M and
thus the number of used moments can be bounded from above by (n + 1)d ≤ CdM if the
parameters are quasi-uniformly distributed. Finally, note that the sum of squares represen-
tation [19, Thm. 3.5] implies that n > d3/2/q + d + 1 suﬃces that the semideﬁnite program
in [8] indeed solves the total variation minimization problem for nonnegative measures in all
dimensions d. In particular, this gives a sharp constant in [8, Thm. 1.2] and bypasses the
relaxation from a nonnegative trigonometric polynomial to the sum of squares representa-
tion, known to possibly increase degrees for d = 2 and to possibly fail for d > 2, cf. [12,
Remark 4.17, Theorem 4.24, and Remark 4.26].

j ) in the d-dimensional Euclidean space, and we refer to [24, 29, 1] for an
introduction to approximation on the sphere and spherical harmonics. The polynomials in
d variables of degree up to n restricted to the sphere can be decomposed into mutually

Theorem 3.14. Let f : {(k, (cid:96)) : k ∈ N0, (cid:96) = 1, . . . , Nk} → R be an M -sparse spherical
harmonic sum with parameters xj ∈ Sd−1, j = 1, . . . , M . If the parameters are q-separated
and n > 2.5πd/q + 1, then

Ω = VSd−1(ker ˜Hn)

where the entries of the matrix
˜Hn := Y (cid:62)

n DYn ∈ RN×N ,

D = diag( ˆf1, . . . , ˆfM ),

mimicking (2.1), can be computed solely from the moments f (k, (cid:96)), k ≤ 2n, (cid:96) = 1, . . . , Nk.

Proof. We just combine Lemmata 3.12, 3.13, and proceed as in Theorem 3.11 to show
ker ˜Hn = ker Yn. Finally note that Y (cid:96)

coeﬃcients and thus

Finally note that the semideﬁnite program in [5, 4] indeed solves the total variation mini-
mization problem for nonnegative measures on spheres in all dimensions d provided the order
of the moments is large enough as shown by the following construction of a dual certiﬁcate
and sum of squares representation.
Corollary 3.15. Let d, n, M ∈ N, Ω = {xj ∈ Sd−1 : j = 1, . . . , M} be q-separated, and
n > 2.5πd/q + 1. Moreover, let ˆpr ∈ RN , r = 1, . . . , N , be an orthonormal basis with
k , then p : Sd−1 → R,

ˆpr ∈ ker(Yn)⊥, r = 1, . . . , M , and pr : Sd−1 → R, pr =(cid:80)n

k always is a polynomial on the sphere

Example 3.16. We conduct the following two small scale numerical examples. For M = 3
points on the unit sphere and a polynomial degree n = 2, we compute the N − M = 6
dimensional kernel of the nonequispaced spherical Fourier matrix Yn, set up the corresponding
kernel polynomials pr, r = 4, . . . , 9, as deﬁned in Corollary 3.15 and plot the surface q(x) =
2 minr=M +1,...,N |pr(x)|1/4, x ∈ S2, in Figure 3.1(a). The absolute value of each kernel
1 + 1
polynomial forms a valley around its zero set which gets narrowed by the 4-th root and the
minimum over all these valleys visualizes the common zeros as junction points in this surface.
In a second experiment, we consider M = 50 random points xj on the unit sphere, an
associated Dirac ensemble with random coeﬃcients ˆfj, and its moments up to order 60, i.e.,
n = 30. The M -dimensional orthogonal complement of the kernel of the matrix ˜Hn deﬁnes
the so-called signal space. Figure 3.1(b) clearly shows that the dual certiﬁcate p, deﬁned as in
Corollary 3.15, peaks exactly at the points xj.

4 Summary

We considered a recently developed multivariate generalization of Prony’s method, charac-
terized its succeeding in terms of an interpolation condition, and gave a generalization to
the sphere. The interpolation condition is shown to hold for separated points in the trigono-
metric and the spherical case in arbitrary dimensions and also yield a certiﬁcate for popular
semideﬁnite relaxations of the reconstruction problems. Beyond the scope of this paper, fu-
ture research needs to address the actual computation of the points and the stability under
noise.
