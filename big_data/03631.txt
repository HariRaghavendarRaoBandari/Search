Laurent Berger

Abstract. — We give a short proof of a conjecture of Lubin concerning certain families
of p-adic power series that commute under composition. We prove that if the family is full
(large enough), there exists a Lubin-Tate formal group such that all the power series in
the family are endomorphisms of this group. The proof uses ramiﬁcation theory and some
p-adic Hodge theory.

Introduction

Let K be a ﬁnite extension of Qp, and let OK be its ring of integers. In [Lub94], Lubin
studied p-adic dynamical systems, namely families of elements of T ·OK[[T ]] that commute
under composition, and remarked that “experimental evidence seems to suggest that for

an invertible series to commute with a noninvertible series, there must be a formal group
somehow in the background”. This observation has motivated the work of a number of

people (Hsia, Laubie, Li, Movaheddi, Salinier, Sarkis, Specter, ...) who proved various
results in that direction. The purpose of this note is to give a proof of a special case of

the above observation, which is referred to as “Lubin’s conjecture” in §3.1 of [Sar10].
Let us consider a family F of commuting power series F (T ) ∈ T · OK[[T ]]. We say that
such a family is full if for all α ∈ OK there exists Fα(T ) ∈ F such that F ′
α(0) = α and if
wideg(Fπ(T )) = q, where wideg(F (T )) denotes the Weierstrass degree of F (T ), π is any
uniformizer of OK and q is the cardinality of the residue ﬁeld of OK.

Theorem. — If F is a full family of commuting power series, there exists a Lubin-Tate
formal group G such that Fα(T ) ∈ End(G) for all α ∈ OK .

This result already appears as corollary 3.11 of [HL15]. Our proof is however con-

siderably shorter than that of ibid., and does not use the theory of the ﬁeld of norms.
It is very similar to that of the main result of [Spe15], which treats the case K = Qp.
The main ingredients are ramiﬁcation theory and some p-adic Hodge theory. In order to
simplify the use of p-adic Hodge theory, we assume that K is a Galois extension of Qp.

1. p-adic dynamical systems

In this note, we consider a set F = {Fα(T )}α∈OK of power series Fα(T ) ∈ T · OK[[T ]]
such that F ′
α(0) = α and Fα ◦ Fβ(T ) = Fβ ◦ Fα(T ) whenever α, β ∈ OK. Recall that π is
a uniformizer of OK, and that q is the cardinality of the residue ﬁeld k of OK. If F (T )
is a power series and n > 0, we denote by F ◦n(T ) the n-th fold iteration F ◦ · · · ◦ F (T ).
If F (T ) has an inverse for the composition, this deﬁnition extends to n ∈ Z. Recall that
the Weierstrass degree wideg(F (T )) of F (T ) = P+∞
i=1 fiT i ∈ T · OK[[T ]] is the smallest
integer i such that fi ∈ O×
K.

Proposition 1.1. — There exists a power series G(T ) ∈ T · k[[T ]] and an integer d > 1
such that G′(0) ∈ k× and Fπ(T ) ≡ G(T pd).

Proof. — This is theorem 6.3 of [Lub94].

Proposition 1.2. — There exists a power series LF (T ) ∈ K[[T ]] such that

1. LF (T ) = T + O(T 2);
2. LF (T ) converges on the open unit disk;
3. LF ◦ Fα(T ) = α · LF (T ) for all α ∈ OK .

Proof. — See propositions 1.2 and 2.2 of [Lub94].

The hypothesis that F is full implies that pd = q, so that wideg(Fπ(T )) = q. For
(u) 6= 0 and let

π (u) = 0 and F ◦n−1

n > 1, let Λn denote the set of u ∈ mCp such that F ◦n
Λ∞ = ∪n>1Λn. The set Λn has qn−1(q − 1) elements.

π

The series Fα(T ) is invertible if α ∈ O×

K so that in this case, Fα(z) = 0 if and only if
◦ Fα(u) =

π (u) = 0 and F ◦n−1

π ◦ Fα(u) = Fα ◦ F ◦n

π

K, then F ◦n

z = 0. If u ∈ Λn and α ∈ O×
Fα ◦ F ◦n−1

π

(u) 6= 0 so that the action of Fα(T ) permutes the elements of Λn.

Let Kn = K(Λn), so that Λi ⊂ Kn if i 6 n, and let K∞ = ∪n>1Kn. If α ∈ O×

K, let

n(α) be the largest integer n > 0 such that α ∈ 1 + πnOK.

Proposition 1.3. — If n > 1 and u ∈ Λn, then

1. Fα(u) = u if and only if n(α) > n;

LUBIN’S CONJECTURE FOR FULL p-ADIC DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

2. If n(α) = n, then wideg(Fα(T ) − T ) = qn;
3. Λn = {Fα(u)}α∈O×

.

K

Proof. — If n = 1 and Fα(u) = u, then u is a root of Fα(T ) − T = (α − 1)T + O(T 2), so
that α − 1 ∈ πOK. This implies that {Fα(u)}α∈O×
has at least q − 1 distinct elements.
These elements are all roots of Fπ(T )/T , whose wideg is q − 1, so {Fα(u)}α∈O×
has
precisely q − 1 elements. These elements all have valuation 1/(q − 1), and the Newton
polygon of Fα(T ) − T starts at the point (1, 1), so that it can have only one segment, and
wideg(Fα(T ) − T ) = q. This implies the proposition for n = 1.

K

K

Assume now that the proposition holds for an n > 1 and take u ∈ Λn+1. If n(α) 6 n,
then Fα(T ) − T has at most qn roots by (2), contained in Λ0 ∪ . . . ∪ Λn by (1). Therefore
therefore has at least qn(q − 1)
Fα(u) = u implies n(α) > n + 1. The set {Fα(u)}α∈O×
distinct elements, all of them roots of F ◦n
(T ). This implies that {Fα(u)}α∈O×
has exactly qn(q − 1) elements. The Newton polygon of Fα(T ) − T starts at the point
(1, n + 1), with n + 1 segments of height one and slopes −1/qk(q − 1) with 0 6 k 6 n, so
that it reaches the point (qn+1, 0) and hence wideg(Fα(T ) − T ) = qn+1. This implies the
proposition for n + 1.

K

Corol lary 1.4. — The ﬁeld K∞ is an abelian extension of K, and if g ∈ Gal(K∞/K),
there is a unique η(g) ∈ O×

K such that g(u) = Fη(g)(u) for all u ∈ Λ∞.

The map η : Gal(K∞/K) → O×

K is an isomorphism.

Proof. — Take u ∈ Λn and α ∈ O×
K. As we have seen above, Fα(u) ∈ Λn, so that the
map u 7→ Fα(u) induces a ﬁeld automorphism of K(u). By (3) of proposition 1.3, this
implies that Kn = K(u) and that every element of Gal(Kn/K) comes from u 7→ Fα(u)
for some α ∈ O×

K. The extension Kn/K is therefore abelian, and so is K∞/K.

The map η is surjective because every Fα(T ) gives rise to an automorphism of K∞,

and it is injective because if η(g) = 1 then g(u) = u for all u ∈ Λ∞ so that g = 1.

In order to prove our main theorem, we study the p-adic periods of η.

2. p-adic Hodge theory

Let R be the p-adic completion of lim

OK[[Xn]] where OK[[Xn]] is seen as a subring
of OK[[Xn+1]] via the identiﬁcation Xn = Fπ(Xn+1) (this ring is deﬁned in [Spe15], where
it is denoted by A∞). We deﬁne an action of GK on R by g(H(Xn)) = H(Fη(g)(Xn)).
This is well-deﬁned since Fπ ◦ Fη(g)(T ) = Fη(g) ◦ Fπ(T ). We have R/πR = lim
k[[Xn]].

−→n>1

−→n>1

Lemma 2.1. — The ring R/πR is perfect.

4

LAURENT BERGER

Proof. — Let G(T ) be as in lemma 1.1. The fact that Xn = Fπ(Xn+1) implies that
G◦n(Xn) = G◦n+1(Xn+1)q. Since G′(0) ∈ k×, we have k[[T ]] = k[[G(T )]] and therefore

R/πR =

lim
−→

Gn(Xn)=Gn+1(Xn+1)q

k[[G◦n(Xn)]]

is perfect.

Let eE+ = lim

←−x7→xq OCp/π. Choose a sequence {un}n>1 with un ∈ Λn and Fπ(un+1) =
un. This sequence gives rise to a map i : R/πR → eE+, determined by the requirement
that i(Xn) = (G◦−1(un), G◦−2(un+1), . . .). The deﬁnition of the action of GK on R and
corollary 1.4 imply that i is GK-equivariant.

Lemma 2.2. — The map i : R/πR → eE+ is injective.

Proof. — It is enough to show that i : k[[Xn]] → eE+ is injective.
If it was not, there
would be a nonzero polynomial P (T ) ∈ k[T ] such that P (i(Xn)) = 0, and i(Xn) =
(G◦−1(un), G◦−2(un+1), . . .) would then belong to Fp, which is clearly not the case.

Let K0 = Qunr

p ∩K and let ˜A+ = OK ⊗OK0

denotes W (eE+), and is denoted by Ainf in ibid.). We have R = OK ⊗OK0
R is a strict π-ring, and by the functoriality of Witt vectors, the map i extends to an
injective and GK-equivariant map i : R → ˜A+. We write x instead of i(X1) ∈ ˜A+. The
GK-equivariance of i implies that g(x) = Fη(g)(x).

W (eE+) (see [Fon94a]; note that ˜A+ usually
W (R/πR) since

Let Bcris and BdR be Fontaine’s rings of periods. Recall that there is a Frobenius map
ϕ on Bcris, a ﬁltration {FiliBdR}i∈Z on BdR, and an injective map K ⊗K0 Bcris → BdR.
There is also an action of GK on Bcris and BdR compatible with the above structure, and
BGK
dR = K. Let ϕq = ϕf on Bcris, where q = pf , extended by K-linearity to K ⊗K0 Bcris.
We refer to [Fon94a] and [Fon94b] for the properties of these objects, and the deﬁnition
of crystalline representations and their Hodge-Tate weights. Let Σ = Gal(K/Qp).
If
τ ∈ Σ, choose a n(τ ) ∈ Z such that τ |K0 = ϕn(τ ). The map τ ⊗ ϕn(τ ) : K ⊗K0 Bcris →
K ⊗K0 Bcris is then well-deﬁned. Recall that LF (T ) ∈ K[[T ]] is the logarithm attached
to F . Since LF (T ) converges on the open unit disk, we can view LF (x) as an element of
K ⊗K0 B+

cris.

Proposition 2.3. — The character η : GK → O×
Hodge-Tate weights.

K is crystalline with nonnegative

Proof. — If g ∈ GK, then g(LF (x)) = LF (g(x)) = LF (Fη(g)(x)) = η(g) · LF (x). Likewise,
if τ ∈ Σ and ℓτ = (τ ⊗ ϕn(τ ))(LF (x)) ∈ K ⊗K0 B+

cris, then g(ℓτ ) = τ (η(g)) · ℓτ .

Corollary 1.4 and local class ﬁeld theory imply that the extension K∞/K is maximal
abelian. By local class ﬁeld theory, this extension is attached to a uniformizer ̟ of OK.
Let χ̟ : GK → O×

K denote the corresponding character.

Lemma 2.4. — Every crystalline character η : GK → O×
Gal(K∞/K) is of the form η = Qτ ∈Σ τ (χ̟)hτ with hτ ∈ Z.

K that factors through

Proof. — If hτ denotes the weight of η at τ , then η · Qτ ∈Σ τ (χ̟)−hτ is crystalline with
weights 0, hence unramiﬁed and therefore trivial since it factors through Gal(K∞/K).

Proposition 2.5. — There exists t̟ ∈ B+

cris such that

1. χ̟(g) = g(t̟)/t̟ for all g ∈ GK;
2. ϕq(t̟)/t̟ = ̟.

Proof. — See for instance §9.3 of [Col02], where this element is denoted by tE.

Corol lary 2.6. — We have LF (x) = λ · Qτ ∈Σ τ (t̟)hτ with hτ ∈ Z>0 and λ ∈ K ×.

Proof. — This follows from the facts that η = Qτ ∈Σ τ (χ̟)hτ , that χ̟(g) = g(t̟)/t̟ and
that BGK

dR = K.

Corol lary 2.7. — We have ϕq(LF (x)) = µ · LF (x) for some µ ∈ πOK.

Proof. — This follows from corollary 2.6. We have µ = Qτ τ (̟)hτ so that if µ was in
O×
K, then hτ would be 0 for all τ which would in turn imply that η is trivial.

Corol lary 2.8. — We have ϕq(x) = Fµ(x).

Proof. — Corollary 2.7 implies that LF (ϕq(x)) = LF (Fµ(x)). We would like to apply
L◦−1
F (T ) but we have to mind the convergence and need to proceed as follows. Since η is
nontrivial, there is a τ ∈ Σ such that hτ −1 > 1. We have

(τ ⊗ ϕn(τ ))(LF (ϕq(x))) = (τ ⊗ ϕn(τ ))(LF (Fµ(x)))

in K ⊗K0 Bcris and hτ −1 > 1 now implies that (τ ⊗ ϕn(τ ))(LF (ϕq(x))) ∈ Fil1BdR so that
we can apply Lτ ◦−1
(T ) in BdR and get that (τ ⊗ ϕn(τ ))(ϕq(x)) = (τ ⊗ ϕn(τ ))(Fµ(x)) in
BdR. This equality also holds in ˜A+, so that ϕq(x) = Fµ(x).

F

Theorem 2.9. — There is a Lubin-Tate formal group G such that Fα(T ) ∈ End(G) for
all α ∈ OK .

6

LAURENT BERGER

Proof. — By corollary 2.8, we have ϕq(x) = Fµ(x). This implies that Fµ(T ) ≡ T q mod
πOK[[T ]]. The Weierstrass degree of Fµ(T ) is qval(µ) so that val(µ) = 1 and Fµ(T ) is a
Lubin-Tate power series. By [LT65], there is a Lubin-Tate formal group G such that
Fµ(T ) ∈ End(G). Since Fα(T ) commutes with Fµ(T ), we also have Fα(T ) ∈ End(G) for
all α ∈ OK.

Remark 2.10. — The above proof implies that µ = ̟ and that η = χ̟.
