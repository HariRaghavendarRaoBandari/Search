THE CLASSIFICATION OF ZAMOLODCHIKOV PERIODIC QUIVERS

PAVEL GALASHIN AND PAVLO PYLYAVSKYY

Abstract. Zamolodchikov periodicity is a property of certain discrete dynamical systems
associated with quivers. It has been shown by Keller to hold for quivers obtained as products
of two Dynkin diagrams. We prove that the quivers exhibiting Zamolodchikov periodicity
are in bijection with pairs of commuting Cartan matrices of ﬁnite type. Such pairs were
classiﬁed by Stembridge in his study of W -graphs. The classiﬁcation includes products of
Dynkin diagrams along with four other inﬁnite families, and eight exceptional cases. We
provide a proof of Zamolodchikov periodicity for all four remaining inﬁnite families, and
verify the exceptional cases using a computer program.

1. Introduction

1.1. Y -systems and T -systems associated with recurrent quivers. A quiver Q is
a directed graph without loops and cycles of length two. Quiver mutations are certain
transformations one can apply to Q at each of its vertices. One can then associate two levels
of algebraic dynamics with quiver mutations: Y -variable dynamics and X-variable dynamics.
Of special interest are quivers Q with a bipartite underlying graph having the following
property. Color all vertices of Q black or white according to the bipartition. It is well known
that mutations of Q (see Section 2.1) at vertices that are not connected by an edge commute.
Thus, we can denote µ• (resp., µ◦) the combined mutations at all black (resp., all white)
vertices of Q, without worrying about the order in which those are performed. A recurrent

quiver is a quiver Q with a bipartite underlying graph such that each of µ• and µ◦ reverses
the directions of arrows in Q, but has no other eﬀect on the quiver. Figure 1 shows two
examples of recurrent quivers.

Given a bipartite recurrent quiver Q one can associate to it a Y -system and a T -system,
which are certain inﬁnite systems of algebraic equations deﬁned as follows. Let Vert(Q) be
the set of vertices of Q and deﬁne x := {xv}v∈Vert(Q) to be the set of indeterminates, one
for each vertex of Q. Let Q(x) be the ﬁeld of rational functions in these variables. The
T -system associated with a bipartite recurrent quiver Q is a family Tv(t) of elements of Q(x)
satisfying the following relations for all v ∈ Vert(Q) and all t ∈ Z :
Tw(t).

Tv(t + 1)Tv(t − 1) = Yu→v

Tu(t) + Yv→w

Here the products are taken over all arrows connecting the two vertices.
Similarly, the Y -system associated with Q is a family Yv(t) of elements of Q(x) satisfying

the following relations for all white 1 vertices v ∈ Vert(Q) and all t ∈ Z:
w (t))−1.

(1 + Y −1

When v is a black vertex, the directions of arrows in the recurrence get reversed:

Yv(t + 1)Yv(t − 1) = Yu→v
Yv(t + 1)Yv(t − 1) = Yv→u

(1 + Yu(t))Yv→w
(1 + Yu(t))Yw→v

(1 + Y −1

w (t))−1.

We say that a map ǫ : Vert(Q) → {0, 1}, v 7→ ǫv is a bipartition if for every edge (u, v)
of Q we have ǫu 6= ǫv. We color a vertex v black if and only if ǫv = 1. Then both T - and
Y -systems associated with Q split into two completely independent ones. Without loss of
generality we may consider only one of them. From now on we assume that both systems
are deﬁned only for t ∈ Z and v ∈ Vert(Q) satisfying

Both systems are set to the following initial conditions:

t + ǫv ≡ 0

(mod 2).

for all v ∈ Vert(Q).

Tv(ǫv) = Yv(ǫv) = xv

1We have to give diﬀerent formulas for vertices of diﬀerent colors because we prefer not to mutate the
edges of the quiver. Alternatively, a single formula would be enough if instead of directions of edges one
would use their colors as deﬁned in Section 1.3.2

Let us say that the T -system or the Y -system associated with a recurrent quiver Q is
periodic if we have Tv(t + 2N) = Tv(t) (respectively, Yv(t + 2N) = Yv(t)) for some positive
integer N and for all v ∈ Vert(Q), t ∈ Z with t + ǫv even. We also refer to a recurrent
quiver Q as Zamolodchikov periodic if the associated T -system is periodic. Equivalently, by
Remark 1.11, Q is Zamolodchikov periodic if and only if the associated Y -system is periodic.
It is a natural question to ask which quivers are Zamolodchikov periodic. In this paper,
we completely classify such quivers. Almost all literature up until now has been concerned
with the tensor product case, explained below. However, the second quiver in Figure 1 is
already Zamolodchikov periodic, but does not arise from the tensor product construction.

Remark 1.2. We use the term Zamolodchikov periodic to indicate the periodicity of the
bipartite dynamics we consider in this paper. We use this term when referring to quivers.
When referring to the speciﬁc T -systems or Y -systems, we just call them periodic. This is
in agreement with the more general notion of T and Y -systems, introduced by T. Nakanishi
in [18].

1.2. The tensor product case and its history. Let Λ and Λ′ be two ADE Dynkin
diagrams. Since ADE Dynkin diagrams are bipartite, we can write:

Vert(Λ) = Λ0 ⊔ Λ1; Vert(Λ′) = Λ′

0 ⊔ Λ′
1.

1), from (Λ1, Λ′

1) to (Λ0, Λ′

1), from (Λ0, Λ′

1) to (Λ0, Λ′

0).

Deﬁne the tensor product Λ ⊗ Λ′, also referred to as box product in the literature, as follows.
• The vertices of Λ ⊗ Λ′ are pairs (u, w) ∈ Vert(Λ) × Vert(Λ′).
• The edges of Λ ⊗ Λ′ connect (u, w) and (u, v) if w and v are connected in Λ′, and
also connect (u, w) and (v, w) if u and v are connected in Λ.
0), from (Λ1, Λ′
• The directions of the the edges in Λ ⊗ Λ′ are from (Λ0, Λ′
0)

0) to (Λ1, Λ′

to (Λ1, Λ′

It is easy to check that thus obtained tensor products of simply-laced Dynkin diagrams are
recurrent quivers.
Example 1.3. The ﬁrst quiver in Figure 1 is the tensor product A3 ⊗ A2.
The following theorem has a long history, which we will brieﬂy explain.

Theorem 1.4 (B. Keller, [10]). If Γ and ∆ are two ADE Dynkin diagrams and h and h′ are
the associated Coxeter numbers (see Section 1.3.1), then the corresponding T - and Y -systems
are periodic, i.e. they satisfy

Tv(t + 2(h + h′)) = Tv(t);
for all v ∈ Vert(Q), t ∈ Z with t + ǫv even.
Remark 1.5. Keller’s theorem is stated for Y -systems. The T -system version is implicit
in [10], however, since the periodicity of g-vectors is proved, see Remark 1.11.

Yv(t + 2(h + h′)) = Yv(t)

Table 1. Coxeter numbers of ADE Dynkin diagrams

The periodicity of Y -systems was ﬁrst discovered by Zamolodchikov in his study of thermo-
dynamic Bethe ansatz [29]. His work was in the generality of simply-laced Dynkin diagrams.
The conjecture was generalized by Ravanini-Valeriani-Tateo [22], Kuniba-Nakanishi [14],
Kuniba-Nakanishi-Suzuki [15], Fomin-Zelevinsky [2]. The special cases of the more general
tensor product version of the conjecture were proved by Frenkel-Szenes [5], Gliozzi-Tateo [6],
Fomin-Zelevinsky [2], Volkov [28], Szenes [26]. In full generality it was proved by Keller [10]
and later in a diﬀerent way by Inoue-Iyama-Keller-Kuniba-Nakanishi [7, 8].

Besides thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, T -systems and Y -systems arise naturally in the
study of other solvable lattice models, see Kuniba-Nakanishi-Suzuki [15], Kirillov-Reshetikhin
[12], Reshetikhin [23], Ogievetsky-Wiegmann [19]; in the study of Kirillov-Reshetikhin mod-
ules and their characters, see Frenkel-Reshetikhin [4], Knight [13], Nakajima [17]; as well
as in other places. For an excellent survey on appearences of T -systems and Y -systems in
physics, see [16].

1.3. Preliminaries.

1.3.1. ADE Dynkin diagrams and their Coxeter numbers. By an ADE Dynkin diagram we
mean a Dynkin diagram of type An, Dn, E6, E7, or E8. The following characterization of
ADE Dynkin diagrams is due to Vinberg [27]:

Theorem 1.6. Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph with possibly multiple edges. Then G
is an ADE Dynkin diagram if and only if there exists a map ν : V → R>0 such that for all
v ∈ V ,

2ν(v) > X(u,v)∈E

ν(u).

For each ADE Dynkin diagram Λ there is an associated integer h(Λ) called Coxeter

number. We list Coxeter numbers of ADE Dynkin diagrams in Table 1.

The following construction will be convenient to describe admissible ADE bigraphs below
and is going to be an important ingredient of the proof in Section 9. The only diagrams
that have a non-trivial automorphism i of order 2 preserving the color of the vertices are
the ones of types A2n−1, Dn, or E6. We are going to take each of these Dynkin diagrams Λ
and describe a new Dynkin diagram Λ′. For each vertex v of Λ ﬁxed by i, we introduce two
vertices v+ and v− of Λ′, and for each pair of vertices (u+, u−) of Λ which are mapped by i to
each other, we introduce just one vertex u of Λ′. We say that the vertex v in Λ corresponds
to the vertices v+, v− in Λ′ while both of the vertices u+, u− in Λ correspond to the vertex u.
For two vertices u′, v′ of Λ′ there is an edge between them if and only if there is an edge

(u, v) in Λ such that u corresponds to u′ and v corresponds to v′.

This construction transforms A2n−1 into Dn+1 and vice versa, see Figure 2; it transforms
E6 into itself and induces a nontrivial correspondence between its vertices. We illustrate this
correspondence in Figure 3.

Remark 1.7. This is a baby version of the construction in Section 9. Note that whenever two
ADE Dynkin diagrams are related by such a construction, their Coxeter numbers coincide:

h(A2n−1) = h(Dn+1) = 2n.

1.3.2. Admissible ADE bigraphs. In [25] Stembridge studies admissible W -graphs for the
case when W = I(p) × I(q) is a direct product of two dihedral groups. These W -graphs
encode the structure of representations of Iwahori-Hecke algebras, and were ﬁrst introduced
by Kazhdan and Lusztig in [9]. The following deﬁnitions are adapted from [25] with slight
modiﬁcations (discussed in Section 2.2). A bigraph is an ordered pair of simple (undirected)
graphs (Γ, ∆) which share a common set of vertices V := Vert(Γ) = Vert(∆) and do not
share edges. A bigraph is called bipartite if there is a map ǫ : V → {0, 1} such that for every
edge (u, v) of Γ or of ∆ we have ǫu 6= ǫv.
There is a simple one-to-one correspondence between bipartite quivers and bipartite bi-
graphs. Namely, to each bipartite quiver Q with a bipartition ǫ : Vert(Q) → {0, 1} we
associate a bigraph G(Q) = (Γ(Q), ∆(Q)) on the same set of vertices deﬁned as follows:
• Γ(Q) contains an (undirected) edge (u, v) if and only if Q contains a directed edge
• ∆(Q) contains an (undirected) edge (u, v) if and only if Q contains a directed edge
Similarly, we can direct the edges of any given bipartite bigaph G to get a bipartite quiver
Q(G).

u → v with ǫu = 0, ǫv = 1;
u → v with ǫu = 1, ǫv = 0.

We will be interested in a particular type of bigraphs. An admissible ADE bigraph is a

bipartite bigraph such that

• each connected component of Γ is an ADE Dynkin diagram;
• each connected component of ∆ is an ADE Dynkin diagram;
• the adjacency |V | × |V | matrices AΓ and A∆ of Γ and ∆ commute.

One important property of admissible ADE bigraphs is the following:

Proposition 1.8 ( [25, Corollary 4.4]). In a connected admissible ADE bigraph (Γ, ∆), there
exist positive integers p and q such that every connected component of Γ has Coxeter number
p and every connected component of ∆ has Coxeter number q.

Figure 4. Tensor product D5 ⊗ A3.

Figure 5. Twist D5 × D5.

For a bipartite quiver Q such that G(Q) is an admissible ADE bigraph, we denote h(Q) :=

p and h′(Q) := q to be the corresponding Coxeter numbers given by this proposition.

It is convenient to think of (Γ, ∆) as of a single graph with edges of two colors: red for

the edges of Γ and blue for the edges of ∆.

The problem of classifying admissible ADE bigraphs is equivalent to that of classifying
pairs of (possibly reducible) commuting Cartan matrices of ﬁnite type satisfying two minor
additional conditions equivalent to Γ and ∆ not sharing any edges and G being bipartite.

Given a bigraph (Γ, ∆), its dual is the bigraph (∆, Γ) on the same set of vertices. It is
obtained from the original bigraph by switching the colors of all edges, and on the level of
bipartite quivers this corresponds to reversing the directions of all arrows.

In [25], Stembridge classiﬁes admissible ADE bigraphs. He proves that there are, up to
taking duals, exactly ﬁve inﬁnite families, as well as eight exceptional cases. Here we list the
inﬁnite families. For the exceptional cases we refer the reader to Appendix A.

Tensor products. This is the familiar to us class of bigraphs that are obtained from
quivers deﬁned in Section 1.2. The ﬁrst quiver in Figure 1 is the tensor product A3 ⊗ A2. A
bit more sophisticated example of D5 ⊗ A3 is shown in Figure 4.
Twists. Twists are denoted Λ × Λ, where Λ is an ADE Dynkin diagram. Twists are
obtained by taking two red copies Λ1 and Λ2 of the Dynkin diagram and connecting u1 ∈ Λ1
and w2 ∈ Λ2 by a blue edge if and only if u1 and the corresponding vertex w1 ∈ Λ1 are
connected. This way, both Γ and ∆ consist of two copies of Λ. The second quiver in Figure
1 corresponds to the twist A3 × A3. A bit more sophisticated example of D5 × D5 is shown
in Figure 5.

Figure 6. The case (AD3)5 ∼ (AD4)4.

Figure 7. The case (A3D)5 ∼ (A4D)4.

The (ADm−1)n family. This family is obtained by taking Am−1 ⊗ Dn+1 and connecting
the last (blue) copy of Dn+1 by red edges to an additional blue component A2n−1. More
precisely, the vertices of Dn+1 are connected to the corresponding vetices of A2n−1 in the
sense of Section 1.3.1. This family is self dual, when one swaps the red and blue colors in
(ADm−1)n one obtains (ADn−1)m. An example of (AD3)5 which is dual to (AD4)4 is shown
in Figure 6. Note that Proposition 1.8 applies here: the red connected components of (AD3)5
are A7 and D5 with h(A7) = h(D5) = 8 while the blue connected components of (AD3)5
are A9 and D6 with h(A9) = h(D6) = 10. Thus if G is the bigraph of type (AD3)5 then
h(G) = 8 and h′(G) = 10.

The (Am−1D)n family. This family is obtained by taking Am−1 ⊗ A2n−1 and connecting
the last (blue) copy of A2n−1 by red edges to an additional blue component Dn+1, again, via
the correspondence described in Section 1.3.1. This family is self dual, when one swaps red
and blue colors in (Am−1D)n one obtains (An−1D)m. An example of (A3D)5 which is dual
to (A4D)4 is shown in Figure 7.

The EEn−1 family. This family is obtained by taking E6 ⊗ An−1 and connecting the last
(red) copy of E6 by blue edges to an additional red component E6 via the correspondence
described in Section 1.3.1. The blue edges then form two components of type A2n−1 and
another two components of type Dn+1, and the middle A2n−1 is connected to the middle
Dn+1 via the construction of Section 1.3.1. The dual of this family is denoted by A2n−1 ≡
A2n−1 ∗ Dn+1 ≡ Dn+1 in [25], however, dual bigraphs yield the same T - and Y - systems (see
Section 2.3), so we only need to consider one of these two families.

An example of EE4 is shown in Figure 8.

1.3.3. The strictly subadditive labeling property. Let Q be a recurrent quiver. A labeling of
its vertices is a function ν : Vert(Q) → R>0, which assigns to each vertex v of Q a positive
real label ν(v). We say that a labeling ν is strictly subadditive if for any vertex v ∈ Vert(Q),
the following two inequalities hold:

As before, the sums here are taken over all possible arrows.

An example of a strictly subadditive labeling of a recurrent quiver Q(D5 ⊗ A3) is given in
Figure 9. We say that a recurrent quiver Q has the strictly subadditive labeling property if
there exists a strictly subadditive labeling ν : Vert(Q) → R>0.
Strictly subadditive labelings of quivers have been introduced in [21]. The terminology is
motivated by Vinberg’s subadditive labelings [27] for non-directed graphs (see Theorem 1.6).

1.3.4. The ﬁxed point property. Consider a T -system associated with a recurrent quiver. We
say that a particular assignment ρ : Vert(Q) → R>1 of real values greater than 1 to the
vertices of Q is a ﬁxed point if when we substitute xu := ρ(u) for all u ∈ Vert(Q) into the
T -system, it becomes time-independent:

for all t ∈ Z and v ∈ Vert(Q) with t + ǫv even.

In other words, ρ is a ﬁxed point if for all v ∈ Vert(Q) it satisﬁes

ρ(w).

An example of a ﬁxed point for a recurrent quiver Q(A3 × A2) is given in Figure 10.
We say that a recurrent quiver has the ﬁxed point property if there exists a ﬁxed point
ρ : Vert(Q) → R>1.
1.3.5. Tropical T -systems. We deﬁne yet another system of algebraic relations associated
with a bipartite recurrent quiver Q.

Let λ : Vert(Q) → R be any map. The tropical T -system tλ associated with Q is a family
v (t) ∈ R of real numbers satisfying the following relation:

tλ

(1.1)

tλ
v (t + 1) + tλ

As before, we impose some initial conditions:

v (t − 1) = max Xu→v

tλ

u(t),Xv→w

w(t)! .

tλ

tλ
v (ǫv) = λ(v)

for all v ∈ Vert(Q) and we again consider only the subsystem deﬁned for t, v such that t + ǫv
is even.
It is easy to see that this system is just the tropicalization of the T -system associated with

Q (see Section 6).
Example 1.9. Let Q be a Dynkin diagram of type A3 ⊗ A1 with Vert(Q) = (a, b, c) and
ǫa = ǫc = 0, ǫb = 1. Let λ : Vert(Q) → R be deﬁned by

λ(a) = 3, λ(b) = −2, λ(c) = 7.

Since both of the edges of the bigraph G(Q) = (Γ,∅) are of the same color, the deﬁning
recurrence (1.1) of the tropical T -system for Q becomes just

tλ
v (t + 1) + tλ

v (t − 1) = max X(u,v)∈Γ

tλ

u(t), 0 .

The values tλ

v (t) of the tropical T -system tλ are given in Table 2, deﬁned only for t + ǫv

even.

v (t + 12) = tλ

v (t + 2N) = tλ

have tλ
t + ǫv even.

1.4. The main theorem and the outline of the proof. The following theorem is the
main result of this paper.

Theorem 1.10. Let Q be a bipartite recurrent quiver. Then the following are equivalent.

(1) G(Q) is an admissible ADE bigraph.
(2) Q has the strictly subadditive labeling property.
(3) Q has the ﬁxed point property.
(4) The tropical T -system associated with Q is periodic for any initial value λ : Vert(Q) →
(5) The T -system associated with Q is periodic.

In all cases, we have

v (t + 2(h + h′)) = tλ
tλ

v (t)

for all λ : Vert(Q) → R and for all v ∈ Vert(Q), t ∈ Z with t+ǫv even. Here h = h(Q) (resp.
h′ = h′(Q)) is the common Coxeter number of all red (resp. blue) connected components of
G(Q) provided by Proposition 1.8.

Now, we are ready to formulate the plan of the paper. First, we discuss the connec-
tion between quivers, bigraphs and Stembirdge’s deﬁnitions in Section 2. Then, we prove
Zamolodchikov periodicity for the case when G(Q) is a twist Λ × Λ in Section 3. After that,
we proceed with the proof of the theorem according the the logic explained in Figure 11.

In Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 we give uniform proofs (that is, independent on Stembridge’s
classiﬁcation) of all implications in Figure 11 except for (1)=⇒(4).
In Section 8, as an
example, we apply our machinery to reprove the periodicity in the AA case ﬁrst shown by
Volkov in [27]. Next, we introduce symmetric labeled bigraphs in Section 9.1 which we then
apply to give a case-by-case proof of (1)=⇒(4) in Section 9.2. Note that we do not reprove
periodicity for tensor products of Dynkin diagrams, instead we reduce the remaining three
inﬁnite families from Stembridge’s classiﬁcation to the case of tensor products. Finally, we
discuss the exceptional cases and the corresponding computer check in Appendix A.

Remark 1.11. It is well established in the literature that the periodicities of T -systems and
that of Y -systems are equivalent. The logic consists of three steps.

by deﬁnition.

• The periodicity of the C-matrix follows from the periodicity of Y -variables, essentially
• The periodicity of the G-matrix is equivalent to the periodicity of X-variables, and
in fact of the whole seed, as was shown in [7, Theorem 5.1], relying on the work of
Plamondon [20].

2. Quiver mutations, commuting Cartan matrices, and admissible ADE

bigraphs

2.1. Quiver mutations. A quiver Q is a directed graph without loops or directed 2-cycles.
For a vertex v of Q one can deﬁne the quiver mutation µv at v as follows:

• for each pair of edges u → v and v → w create an edge u → w;
• reverse the direction of all edges adjacent to v;
• if some directed 2-cycle is present, remove both of its edges; repeat until there are no

more directed 2-cycles.

Let us denote the resulting quiver µv(Q).
Mutations in the case A3 ⊗ A2 are illustrated in Figure 12.
Now, let Q be a bipartite quiver. Recall that µ◦ (resp., µ•) is the simultaneous mutation
at all white (resp., all black) vertices of Q. The following proposition is transparent from
the deﬁnition.

Proposition 2.1. For a bipartite quiver Q, if ǫu 6= ǫv then the number of edges u → v in Q
equals the number of edges v → u in µ◦(Q). Otherwise, if u, v are both black (resp., white),
then the number of edges u → v in µ◦(Q) (resp., in µ•(Q)) is equal to the number of directed
paths of length 2 from u to v in Q.

Corollary 2.2. A bipartite quiver Q is recurrent if and only if for any two vertices u, v of
the same color, the number of directed paths of length 2 from u to v equals the number of
directed paths of length 2 from v to u.

Translating this property into the language of bigraphs yields the following characteriza-

tion:

Corollary 2.3. A bipartite quiver Q is recurrent if and only if the associated bipartite bigraph
G(Q) has commuting adjacency matrices AΓ, A∆.

Proof. This follows immediately from the observation that if u and v are both black (resp.,
white), then the number of directed paths of length 2 from u to v in Q equals the number
of red-blue (resp., blue-red) paths of length 2 from u to v in G(Q).
(cid:3)

2.2. A condition on 2 × 2 partitions. In [25, Deﬁnition 1.1], Stembridge requires an
admissible ADE bigraph to have a 2 × 2 vertex partition, that is, a pair of maps cΓ, c∆ :
V → {0, 1} so that

(cΓ(u), c∆(u)) = (1 − cΓ(v), c∆(v))
(cΓ(u), c∆(u)) = (cΓ(v), 1 − c∆(v))

for all (u, v) ∈ Γ;
for all (u, v) ∈ ∆.

Let us introduce a temporary terminology and call such bigraphs admissible 2 × 2 ADE
bigraphs.
Proposition 2.4. Every admissible ADE bigraph is an admissible 2 × 2 ADE bigraph.
Proof. Following [25, Section 2], the component graph Comp(Γ) of Γ is a simple graph whose
vertices are connected components of Γ, and two of them are connected by an edge in
Comp(Γ) if and only if there is an edge of ∆ between the two corresponding connected
components.

Lemma 2.5 ( [25, Lemma 2.5(b)]). Suppose (Γ, ∆) is a bigraph with commuting adjacency
matrices such that ∆ is acyclic. Then the Comp(Γ) is acyclic.

THE CLASSIFICATION OF ZAMOLODCHIKOV PERIODIC QUIVERS

Using this lemma, it becomes easy to construct the 2× 2 partition (cΓ, c∆). Namely, since
the component graph of Γ is acyclic, it is bipartite. Let τ : V → {0, 1} be such that τ (v) = 1
if and only if v is contained in the connected component of Γ that corresponds to a black
vertex of Comp(Γ). Then for any v ∈ V we can put
cΓ(v) ≡ τ (v) + ǫv
c∆(v) = τ (v).

(mod 2);

Thus if (u, v) ∈ Γ then τ (u) = τ (v) while ǫu 6= ǫv. Similarly, if (u, v) ∈ ∆ then τ (u) 6= τ (v)

as well as ǫu 6= ǫv so cΓ(u) = cΓ(v).

(cid:3)

2.3. Reformulation of the dynamics in terms of bigraphs. Let G = (Γ, ∆) be a
bipartite bigraph with a vertex set V . Then the associated T -system for G is deﬁned as
follows:

Tv(t + 1)Tv(t − 1) = Y(u,v)∈Γ

Tu(t) + Y(v,w)∈∆

Tw(t);

Tv(ǫv) = xv.

It is easy to see that this system is equivalent to the corresponding system deﬁned for Q(G).
The Y - and tropical T -systems for G are deﬁned in a similar way: replace u → v (resp.,
v → w) by (u, v) ∈ Γ (resp., by (v, w) ∈ ∆) in the corresponding deﬁnition.

3. Twists

A labeled quiver is by deﬁnition a pair (Q, ρ) where Q is a quiver and ρ : Vert(Q) → R>0
is a labeling of its vertices by positive numbers. Let V be any set, and we would like to
consider all labeled quivers (Q, ρ) with vertex set V . Given a vertex v ∈ V , one can deﬁne
where ρ′(u) = ρ(u) for all u 6= v, and

an operationeµv acting on labeled quivers with vertex set V . Namely, eµv(Q, ρ) = (µv(Q), ρ′)
When Q is a bipartite recurrent quiver, we deﬁneeµ◦ (resp.,eµ•) to be the product ofeµv over
application ofeµ◦eµ• to some initial value labeling.

Let Λ be a Dynkin diagram, and consider its twist Λ × Λ. Deﬁne the quiver QΛ to be
Q(Λ × Λ). For each node v of Λ, let v1 and v2 be the two corresponding nodes in QΛ.
Deﬁne sv to be the operation on labeled quivers of “swapping” the vertices v1 and v2. More
precisely, if (Q, ρ) is a labeled quiver with vertex set Vert(QΛ), then sv(Q, ρ) = (Q′, ρ′) is
deﬁned as follows:

all white (resp., black) vertices of Q. And then the T -system can be viewed as a repeated

ρ′(v)ρ(v) = Yu→v

ρ(u) + Yv→w

ρ(w).

ρ′(v2) = ρ(v1);

• ρ′(u) = ρ(u) for all u ∈ Vert(QΛ) \ {v1, v2};
• ρ′(v1) = ρ(v2);
• (u → v1) is an edge of Q if and only if (u → v2) is an edge of Q′. Similarly for the

edges (u → v2), (v1 → w), (v2 → w). All other edges are the same for Q and Q′.
to (QΛ, ρ) commute with each other. This allows us to deﬁne the following operation:

Now, since v1 and v2 are not connected by an edge in QΛ, the mutationseµv1 andeµv2 applied

¯µv = sv ◦eµv1 ◦eµv2.

Figure 13. The local part of Λ × Λ as the Q(A2 ⊗ A2) quiver.

Informally, we mutate at v1 and v2, and then swap them in the quiver.

Proposition 3.1. If ¯µv(QΛ, ρ) = (Q′, ρ′) then Q′ = QΛ. In other words, the operations ¯µv
preserve the quiver QΛ.
Proof. For each pair of arrows u → v1 → w there exists the corresponding pair of arrows
w → v2 → u and vice versa. Thus, no new arrows are created. The directions of arrows
adjacent to v1 and v2 are reversed, however applying su recovers the original directions. (cid:3)

Theorem 3.2. The operations ¯µv satisfy the relations of the Coxeter group deﬁned by Λ.
Speciﬁcally, (¯µu ◦ ¯µw)3 = id if u and w are adjacent in Λ, and (¯µu ◦ ¯µw)2 = id otherwise.
Proof. The case of u and w not adjacent is trivial. Assume u and w are adjacent. The
relation (¯µu ◦ ¯µw)3 = id can be seen to hold via a short direct computation. Alternatively,
note that it holds when u and w are the only two vertices of Λ = A2: in this case it is just
the A2 ⊗ A2 case of Zamolodchikov periodicity, which can be easily veriﬁed to hold with
principal coeﬃcients. By [3, Theorem 4.6] this implies that the relation holds with arbitrary
choice of coeﬃcients, in particular with all the other vertices surrounding u1, u2, w1, w2 in
QΛ.
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.3. Both T -system and tropical T -system versions of periodicity hold for twists
Λ × Λ.
Proof. The time evolution of the T -system is the action of

where

eµ◦eµ• = Yv∈Λ
¯µΛ = Yv is a ◦

sv! ◦ ¯µΛ,
¯µv Yv is a •

¯µv

acts as the Coxeter element in the Coxeter group associated with Λ. Therefore, (¯µΛ)h = id,
where h is the Coxeter number of Λ. Taking into account the additional vertex swapping

operatorQv∈Λ sv applied at each step that commutes with ¯µΛ, we have

(eµ◦eµ•)2h = Yv∈Λ

su ◦ ¯µΛ!2h

= id,

where the 2 in the exponent is needed if h is odd and not needed if h is even.

THE CLASSIFICATION OF ZAMOLODCHIKOV PERIODIC QUIVERS

The fact that the same remains true in the tropical T -system follows from the general
principle that the periodicity of the birational dynamics implies the periodicity of the tropical
dynamics, see Proposition 6.8.
(cid:3)

4. Fixed point property ⇐⇒ strictly subadditive labeling property

Let Q be a bipartite quiver with vertex set V := Vert(Q).
Recall from Section 1.3.4 that a map ρ : V → R>1 is a ﬁxed point if for any v ∈ V ,

ρ(v)2 = Yu→v

2ν(v) >Xu→v

ν(u);

ρ(w).

ρ(u) + Yv→w
2ν(v) >Xv→w

ν(w).

Zρ(v) =sYu→v

ρ(u) + Yv→w

ρ(w).

Recall from Section 1.3.3 that a map ν : V → R>0 is a strictly subadditive labeling if for any
v ∈ Vert(Q),

Proposition 4.1. There exists a ﬁxed point for Q if and only if there exists a strictly
subadditive labeling for Q.
Proof. For any map ρ : V → R≥1, deﬁne Zρ : V → R≥1 by

Thus we are concerned with the ﬁxed points of a continuous operator Z : R|V |

First, deﬁne ρ0(v) := 1 for all v, then Zρ0(v) ≥ √2 > ρ0(v) for all v. For two maps
ρ′, ρ′′ : V → R≥1 we write ρ′ > ρ′′ (resp., ρ′ ≥ ρ′′) if and only if for all v, ρ′(v) > ρ′′(v) (resp.,
ρ′(v) ≥ ρ′′(v)).

Now we can reﬁne Proposition 4.1 using an intermediate condition:

≥1 → R|V |
≥1.

Lemma 4.2. For a bipartite quiver Q, the following are equivalent:

(1) There exists a strictly subadditive labeling for Q.
(2) There exists a map ρ1 : V → R>1 satisfying ρ0 < Zρ1 < ρ1.
(3) There exists a ﬁxed point for Q.
We start with (2)=⇒(3). The proof is identical to the proof of [11, Theorem 2] where this
theorem is attributed to Tarski. Namely, it is easy to see that if ρ ≥ ρ′ then Zρ ≥ Zρ′. We
have found two maps ρ0, ρ1 such that Zρ0 > ρ0 and Zρ1 < ρ1. Therefore a convex compact
set (which is just a parallelotope) [ρ0, ρ1] := {ρ : V → R≥1 | ρ0(v) ≤ ρ(v) ≤ ρ1(v) v ∈ V }
is mapped by Z to itself, so (3) follows immediately from the Brouwer ﬁxed point theorem.
Since Zρ0 > ρ0, none of the coordinates of this ﬁxed point can be equal to 1 and thus our
ﬁxed point is a map ρ : V → R>1.
ν(v) := log ρ(v) > 0 and then we have

Now we want to show (3)=⇒(1). Assume ρ : V → R>1 is a ﬁxed point of Z. Deﬁne

exp(ν(v)) = ρ(v) = Zρ(v) =sYu→v

so after taking the logarithm of both sides we see that ν is a strictly subadditive labeling.
The only thing left to show is (1)=⇒(2). Assume ν : V → R>0 is a strictly subadditive

labeling of vertices of Q. In other words, for any v we have

Since the number of vertices is ﬁnite, there exists a number q > 0 such that

2ν(v) >Xu→v
2ν(v) − q >Xu→v

ν(u),

ν(u),

ν(w).

2ν(v) >Xv→w
2ν(v) − q >Xv→w

ν(w).

Let α > 1 be a big enough real number so that αq > 2 and put ρ1(v) := αν(v) for all v ∈ V .

Then we have

Zρ1(v) = sYu→v

ρ1(u) + Yv→w

ρ1(w) =pαPu→v ν(u) + αPv→w ν(w)

< √2α2ν(v)−q < αν(v) = ρ1(v).

Clearly, we have ρ0 < ρ1 and thus Zρ0 < Zρ1 so

ρ0 < Zρ0 < Zρ1 < ρ1,

which ﬁnishes the proof of Lemma 4.2 and thus the proof of Proposition 4.1.

(cid:3)

5. Strictly subadditive labeling property ⇐⇒ admissible ADE bigraph

property

Proposition 5.1. Let Q be a bipartite recurrent quiver. Then Q has a strictly subadditive
labeling if and only if G(Q) is an admissible ADE bigraph.

Proof. We have already shown in Corollary 2.3 that if Q is a bipartite recurrent quiver
then the adjacency matrices AΓ and A∆ of the associated bipartite bigraph G(Q) = (Γ, ∆)
commute with each other. Thus we just need to show that Q has a strictly subadditive
labeling if and only if all connected components of Γ and of ∆ are ADE Dynkin diagrams.
One direction follows from Vinberg’s characterization (see Theorem 1.6). If ν : Vert(Q) →
R>0 is a strictly subadditive labeling then its restriction to each connected component of Γ or
∆ gives a labeling of the vertices of this component satisfying the conditions of Theorem 1.6
and therefore forces this component to be an ADE Dynkin diagram.

To go in the other direction, we use a construction from the proof of [25, Lemma 4.5]. In
the course of this proof, for any admissible ADE bigraph (Γ, ∆) Stembridge constructs a
vector v : Vert(Q) → R>0 such that its restriction onto each connected component of Γ or
of ∆ is a strictly positive multiple of the dominant eigenvector for (the adjacency matrix of)
this connected component. Since the dominant eigenvalue for each connected component of
Γ (resp., of ∆) is equal to 2 cos(π/h) (resp., 2 cos(π/h′)) where h, h′ are common Coxeter
numbers provided by Proposition 1.8, we conclude that v is a positive common eigenvector for
both AΓ and A∆ with eigenvalues 2 cos(π/h) and 2 cos(π/h′) respectively. By the deﬁnition
of the adjacency matrix, this can be rewritten as

2 cos(π/h)v(v) = X(v,u)∈Γ

v(u)

THE CLASSIFICATION OF ZAMOLODCHIKOV PERIODIC QUIVERS

17

for all v ∈ Vert(Q), and similarly

2 cos(π/h′)v(v) = X(v,w)∈∆

v(w).

Since 2 > 2 cos(π/h) and 2 > 2 cos(π/h′) for any admissible ADE bigraph, it follows that v
is a strictly subadditive labeling for Q.
(cid:3)

6. Connection between periodicity and tropical periodicity

Let Q be a bipartite recurrent quiver. Then there is the T -system and the tropical T -
system associated with Q. For clarity, we are going to call the former the birational T -system
associated with Q.

6.1. Newton polytopes and positivity. Let Z[x±1] denote the ring of Laurent polyno-
mials in variables x = {xv}v∈Vert(Q). Since the T -system associated with Q is a special case
of a cluster algebra, the Laurent phenomenon of Fomin and Zelevinsky [1] states that for all
v ∈ Vert(Q) and t ∈ Z with t + ǫv even, the value Tv(t) belongs to Z[x±1].
.

In this section, we identify maps

Let d := |Vert(Q)| be the number of vertices of Q.
For any Laurent polynomial p ∈ Z[x±1], say,

Vert(Q) → Z with vectors in Zd and for α ∈ Zd, we deﬁne xα :=Qv xα(v)

v

deﬁne its Newton polytope Newton(p) ⊂ Rd to be

Recall that for two polytopes P1, P2 ⊂ Rd, their Minkowski sum P1 + P2 is deﬁned as follows:

Newton(p) := Conv{α ∈ Zd | cα 6= 0}.

P1 + P2 = {z1 + z2 | z1 ∈ P1, z2 ∈ P2}.

Comparing the deﬁnitions, one immediately obtains the following well-known property of
Newton polytopes: for p1, p2 ∈ Z[x±1], we have

Newton(p1p2) = Newton(p1) + Newton(p2).

Deﬁnition 6.1. A Laurent polynomial

p = Xα∈Zd

cαxα,

p = Xα∈Zd

cαxα

is called Newton-positive if for every α that is a vertex of Newton(p), we have cα > 0.

The following lemma is straightforward:

Lemma 6.2. Let p1, p2, p ∈ Z[x±1] be Laurent polynomials and assume p1, p2 are Newton-
positive. Then p is also Newton-positive if it satisﬁes one of the following:

• p = p1p2, or
• p = p1/p2, or
• p = p1 + p2.

Moreover, if p1 and p2 are Newton-positive, then

Newton(p1 + p2) = Conv (Newton(p1) ∪ Newton(p2)) .

18

PAVEL GALASHIN AND PAVLO PYLYAVSKYY

6.2. Degrees and support functions. For a linear function λ : Rd → R and a polytope
P ⊂ Rd, deﬁne sup(λ, P ) := sup{λ(z) | z ∈ P}. This supremum is actually a maximum since
P is compact, but we choose this notation to avoid confusion with the tropical T -system
relations.
Lemma 6.3. For a map λ : Vert(Q) → R, the tropical T -system tλ associated with Q is
obtained from the birational T -system via the following transformation:

(6.1)

tλ
v (t) = sup (λ, Newton(Tv(t)))

Proof. Since the Laurent polynomial xv is Newton-positive for every v,
it follows from
Lemma 6.2 that the Laurent polynomial Tv(t) is Newton-positive for all t ∈ Z, v ∈ Vert(Q).
Next, (6.1) clearly holds for t = ǫv. It remains to note that for any linear function λ : Rd → R
and any two polytopes P1 and P2,

sup(λ, P1 + P2) = sup(λ, P1) + sup(λ, P2),

and

sup(λ, Conv(P1 ∪ P2)) = max (sup(λ, P1), sup(λ, P2)) .

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 6.4. For p ∈ Z[x±1] and v ∈ Vert(Q), we deﬁne degmax(v, p) ∈ Z (resp.,
degmin(v, p) ∈ Z) to be the maximal (resp., minimal) degree of xv in p viewed as an ele-
ment of Z[x±1

v ] with all the other indeterminates {xu}u6=v regarded as constants.

For u ∈ Vert(Q), set δu : Vert(Q) → R to be

δu(v) :=(1,

if u = v;

0, otherwise.

As always, we extend this map by linearity to a map δu : Zd → R. Then degmax(u, p) and

degmin(u, p) can be expressed in terms of the Newton polytope of p as follows:

degmax(u, p) = sup(δu, Newton(p));
degmin(u, p) = inf(δu, Newton(p)) := −sup(−δu, Newton(p)).

Corollary 6.5. We have

for all u, v ∈ Vert(Q) and all t ∈ Z with t + ǫv even.

tδu
v (t) = degmax(u, Tv(t))

That is, the tropical T -system with initial condition δu controls the maximal degrees of
xu in Laurent polynomials appearing as entries of the birational T -system. The following
proposition shows that it controls the minimal degrees of xu as well, even though we still
take the maximum in the recurrence for tλ
Proposition 6.6. For all t ∈ Z and u, v ∈ Vert(Q) such that t + ǫv is even,

v (t):

• If ǫu = 0 then

• If ǫu = 1 then

Proof. The integers −degmin(u, Tv(t)) clearly satisfy the same recurrence as the integers
degmax(u, Tv(t)). Therefore it only remains to check the initial case t = ǫv. Assume for
example that ǫu = 0. Initially,

degmax(u, Tv(ǫv)) = δu(v)

and

Let us now look at t = 2, thus Tv(t) is deﬁned only for ǫv = 0. Since ǫu = 0 as well, v and u
have to be of the same color, so they are not connected and thus

−degmin(u, Tv(ǫv)) = −δu(v).

degmax(u, Tv(2)) = max(0, 0) − degmax(u, Tv(0)) = −δu(v).

For t = 3, v and u have to be of diﬀerent color. So they are either not connected in which
case we will get a zero again, or they are connected in which case we will get

degmax(u, Tv(3)) = max(−1, 0) − degmax(u, Tv(1)) = 0.

To sum up,

degmax(u, Tv(2 + ǫv)) = −δu(v) = −degmin(u, Tv(ǫv)).

Since both sides of (6.2) agree on the initial conditions and satisfy the same recurrence, they
are equal. The case ǫu = 1 in the proof of (6.3) is treated similarly.
(cid:3)

Example 6.7. Let Q, a, b, c, ǫ be as in Example 1.9. In order to illustrate Proposition 6.6,
we give the values of tδu
v (t) for all u, v ∈ Vert(Q) and all t = 0, . . . , 13 with even t + ǫv in
Table 3.

For example, for u = a and t = 2, we see that

tδu

v (2 + ǫv) = −tδu

v (ǫv) = −degmin(u, Newton(xv)).

20

PAVEL GALASHIN AND PAVLO PYLYAVSKYY

For u = b and t = −2,

tδu

v (−2 + ǫv) = tδu

v (10 + ǫv) = −tδu

v (ǫv) = −degmin(u, Newton(xv)).

We summarize the results of this section as follows:

Proposition 6.8. For an integer N and a bipartite recurrent quiver Q, the following are
equivalent:
(1) tδu
v (ǫv) for all u, v ∈ Vert(Q);
(2) tλ
v (t) for all λ : Vert(Q) → R and v ∈ Vert(Q), t ∈ Z with t + ǫv even;
(3) There exists a map c : Vert(Q) → R>0 such that Tv(t + 2N) = c(v)Tv(t) for all

v (2N + ǫv) = tδu
v (t + 2N) = tλ

v ∈ Vert(Q), t ∈ Z with t + ǫv even.

In any of these cases, if Q has the ﬁxed point property then c(v) = 1 for all v.
Proof. Note that (2)=⇒(1) is trivial. Also, (3)=⇒(2) follows directly from Lemma 6.3.
To show (1)=⇒(3), note that it is enough to consider t = ǫv, because if Tv(2N + ǫv) =
c(v)Tv(ǫv) for all v then we can get the case of arbitrary t by a substitution xv := Tv(t + ǫv)
for all v. By Proposition 6.6, (1) implies that for every u, v ∈ Vert(Q),

degmax(u, Tv(2N + ǫv)) = degmax(u, Tv(ǫv)); degmin(u, Tv(2N + ǫv)) = degmin(u, Tv(ǫv)).

Therefore the Laurent polynomials Tv(2N + ǫv) and Tv(ǫv) diﬀer by a scalar multiple c(v).
But since they are both Newton-positive, c(v) is necessarily positive, so (3) follows.

Now, if ρ : Vert(Q) → R>1 is a ﬁxed point, then substituting xv := ρ(v) for all v into

Tv(t + 2N) = c(v)Tv(t) yields ρ(v) = c(v)ρ(v) and thus c(v) = 1.

(cid:3)

Proposition 6.8 is important both for the rest of the proof and for computer checks:

it
reduces the problem of checking periodicity of the birational T -system to the problem of
checking periodicity of tδu
for every u, v ∈ Vert(Q). Unlike the birational T -system where
v
the values of Tv(t) are multivariate Laurent polynomials, here we are dealing with small
integers. As a result, this dramatically reduces the complexity of the code and the amount
of time needed to check the exceptional cases (see Remark A.1).

7. Tropical periodicity implies the strictly subadditive labeling property

Proposition 7.1. Let Q be a bipartite recurrent quiver and assume that the tropical T -system
associated with Q is periodic. Then Q has the strictly subadditive labeling property.
Proof. We let N be an integer such that for all u, v ∈ Vert(Q), tδu
v (ǫv) (by
Proposition 6.8, this is a special case of tropical periodicity). Now, we want to ﬁnd a strictly
subadditive labeling ν : Vert(Q) → R>0. In order to do it, we construct certain intermediate
maps bu : Vert(Q) → R. Following the proof of [24, Theorem 9.1], we let bu be just the sum
of degmax(u, Tv(t)) over the period:

v (ǫv + 2N) = tδu

bu(v) :=

tδu
v (2j + ǫv).

N −1Xj=0

First, we want to show that bu(v) ≥ 0 for all u, v ∈ Vert(Q). By Proposition 6.6, the aver-
age of degmax(u, Tv(t)) over t equals the average of −degmin(u, Tv(t)). Since degmax(u, Tv(t)) ≥
degmin(u, Tv(t)), we get that bu(v) ≥ −bu(v). This implies that bu(v) ≥ 0 for all u, v ∈
Vert(Q).

In addition, if u and v are connected by an edge, and ǫu = 1, ǫv = 0 then degmax(u, Tv(2)) =
1 > 0 = degmin(u, Tv(2)) and in this case bu(v) > −bu(v). Similarly, if ǫu = 0, ǫv = 1 then
degmax(u, Tv(−1)) = 1 > 0 = degmin(u, Tv(−1)). Hence bu(v) > 0 if u and v are neighbors in
Q.
Second, we claim that the labeling bu is subadditive (even though it may or may not be

strictly subadditive):

(7.1)

bu(w)! .

bu(w),Xv→w

Indeed, using the periodicity of tδu

v , we can write

2bu(v) =

tδu
v (2j + ǫv)

Thus bu(v) is subadditive. The only way (7.1) can be an equality for some vertex v is

when either of the following holds:
• for all j ∈ {0, 1, . . . , N − 1},

(7.2)

(7.3)

• for all j ∈ {0, 1, . . . , N − 1},

As we note in the proof of Proposition 6.6, there are two integers j1 and j2 such that for all
w,

Thus, if v is a neighbor of u then neither (7.2) nor (7.3) happens for all values of j simulta-
neously. It follows that the inequality (7.1) is strict when v is a neighbor of u. This allows
us to deﬁne ν as a sum of all bu’s:

tδu
w (2j1 + 1 + ǫv) = δu(w);
tδu
w (2j2 + 1 + ǫv) = −δu(w).

ν(v) := Xu∈Vert(Q)

bu(v).

22

PAVEL GALASHIN AND PAVLO PYLYAVSKYY

Clearly, ν inherits subadditivity from bu, and since each vertex v is a neighbor of some vertex
u, ν is strict at every vertex. By the same reason, ν(v) > 0 for every v ∈ Vert(Q).
(cid:3)
Remark 7.2. The proof of [24, Theorem 9.1] can be applied directly to show that the
periodicity of the birational T -system with all xv’s set to be equal to 1 implies the strictly
subadditive labeling property. More speciﬁcally, one can set ν(v) to be the logarithm of

N −1Yj=0

Tv(ǫv + 2j) |x:=1 .

It follows that such a labeling ν is strictly subadditive. However, there are bipartite quivers
for which the birational and tropical T -systems are periodic only for some initial conditions.
For example, if Q is a quiver of type A2 ⊗ A2 with three copies of each arrow, one can ﬁnd
a “ﬁxed point” ρ : Vert(Q) → R>0 deﬁned by ρ(v) = 1/2 for all v ∈ Vert(Q). Similarly,
there is a “strictly subadditive labeling” ν : Vert(Q) → R deﬁned by ν(v) = −1 for all
v ∈ Vert(Q). Thus we see that the requirements that the ﬁxed point must take values in
R>1 and that the strictly subadditive labeling must take values in R>0 cannot be dropped.
If one instead takes just two copies of each arrow in A2 ⊗ A2 and sets λ(v) := 1 for all
v ∈ Vert(Q), one gets a periodic tropical T -system with tλ
v (t) = 1 for all v ∈ Vert(Q), t ∈ Z
with t + ǫv even. Lots of other examples with the tropical T -system being periodic for some
λ can be constructed using the duality in Section 9.1.

8. Example: proof of the periodicity in the An ⊗ Am case

Since An ⊗ Am is an admissible ADE bigraph, we know by Propositions 4.1 and 5.1
that there is a strictly subadditive labeling ν : Vert(Q) → R>0 as well as a ﬁxed point
ρ : Vert(Q) → R>1. Here Q = Q(An ⊗ Am). By Proposition 6.8, we know therefore that the
birational T -system satisﬁes

(8.1)

Tv(t) = Tv(t + 2N)

if and only if the tropical T -system satisﬁes

v (ǫv)

tδu
v (ǫv + 2N) = tδu

(8.2)
for all u, v ∈ Vert(Q). Thus, in order to prove (8.1) for Q, we only need to check (8.2) for
all u, v.
First, let us introduce some notation. The vertices of Q can be naturally labeled by pairs
of numbers (a, b) with a = 1, 2, . . . , n and b = 1, 2, . . . , m. For each such pair, we denote the
corresponding vertex of Q by v(a, b). We deﬁne ¯a := n + 1 − a and ¯b := n + 1 − b to be
the coordinates of the opposite vertex of Q. For an illustration of the below argument, see
Example 1.9 for n = 3, m = 1.

For the rest of this section we assume that tλ
v (t − 1).

when t + ǫv is odd we just put tλ
Lemma 8.1. Let u := v(a, b). Assume that ǫu = 1. Deﬁne the following four sequences of
numbers whose entries are indexed by t = 1, 2, . . . , n + m:

v (t) is deﬁned for all v ∈ Vert(Q), t ∈ Z, and

v (t) := tλ

rSE = (a + b, a + b + 1, . . . , n + m − 1, n + m, n + m − 1, . . . , ¯a + ¯b);
rNW = (a + b, a + b − 1, . . . , 3, 2, 3, . . . , ¯a + ¯b);
rSW = (b − a, b − a − 1, . . . , 2 − n, 1 − n, 2 − n, . . . , ¯b − ¯a);
rNE = (b − a, b − a + 1, . . . , m − 2, m − 1, m − 2, . . . , ¯b − ¯a).

THE CLASSIFICATION OF ZAMOLODCHIKOV PERIODIC QUIVERS

Then for t = 1, 2, . . . , n + m,

if rNW(t) ≤ i + j ≤ rSE(t) and rSW(t) ≤ j − i ≤ rNE(t);

v(i,j)(t) =(1,

0, otherwise.

Proof. Follows by induction from the deﬁning relations of the tropical T -system.

(cid:3)

Thus, for the case ǫu = 1, we get the following dynamics. For t = 0, 1, tδu

∗ (t) = δu viewed
as a map v 7→ tδu
∗ (t) is ﬁlled with ones inside a certain
rectangle bounded by four moving diagonals and zero outside. Each of these diagonals moves
away from the vertex v(a, b) until it hits the corner of the rectangle, and it starts moving
back immediately after that until the four diagonals meet at the vertex v(¯a, ¯b). Next,

v (t). Next, for t = 1, 2, . . . , n + m, tδu

tδu
∗ (n + m + 1) = tδu

∗ (n + m + 2) = tδu

∗ (n + m + 3) = −δv(¯a,¯b)

since we take the maximum in the deﬁnition of the tropical T -system and thus the negative
value does not propagate. For t = n + m + 3, . . . , 2(n + m + 1) we see our process in reverse,
that is,

δv(a,b)
t
∗

δv(¯a,¯b)
(t + n + m + 2) = t
∗

(t)

for all t ∈ Z, just because they coincide for t = 0, 1. Thus,
tδu
∗ (t + 2(n + m + 2)) = tδu

∗ (t)

for all u ∈ Vert(Q). For the case ǫu = 0, we start by mutating the value at u into a −1, so
time in this case goes in the reverse direction. Note that the Coxeter numbers for Q from
Proposition 1.8 are h = n + 1 and h′ = m + 1 so our tropical T -system satisﬁes

v (ǫv + 2(h + h′)) = tδu
tδu

v (ǫv).

Since a ﬁxed point exists for Q, we deduce from Proposition 6.8 that the same relation is
satisﬁed by the birational T -system.

9. Admissible ADE bigraphs have the tropical periodicity property

Stembridge’s classiﬁcation [25] contains ﬁve inﬁnite families, one of them being tensor
products of pairs of Dynkin diagrams, for which the periodicity was shown by Keller in [10].
The second family, twists Λ × Λ, give rise to periodic T -systems by Corollary 3.3. A crucial
observation is that the remaining three families possess rich symmetries.
In particular,
recall from Section 1.3.2 that each of them was constructed using the involutions described
in Section 1.3.1. We are going to extend these involutions to Stembridge’s bigraphs and
show that the operation of taking the dual with respect to such an involution “commutes”
with applying tropical mutations.

9.1. Symmetric labeled bigraphs. The right combinatorial object for us turns out to be
rather involved.

Deﬁnition 9.1. A symmetric labeled bigraph B := (G, i, V+, V0, V−, ρ, X) consists of the
following data:

(1) G = (Γ, ∆) is a bipartite bigraph with vertex set V .
(2) i : V → V is an automorphism of G of order 2 that preserves the colors of vertices
(3) V0 = Fix(i) is the set of vertices ﬁxed by i.

and edges.

24

PAVEL GALASHIN AND PAVLO PYLYAVSKYY

(4) We have a partition

such that whenever u 6= v, u = i(v) then either u ∈ V+, v ∈ V− or u ∈ V− and v ∈ V+.
(5) ρ : V → R is an i-symmetric labeling of vertices of G. That is, for any v ∈ V we
have

V = V+ ⊔ V0 ⊔ V−

ρ(i(v)) = ρ(v).

(6) Finally, X is an arbitrary set of edges (u, v) that are ﬁxed by i. Since i preserves the
color of each vertex, an edge (u, v) is ﬁxed by i if and only if u = i(u) and v = i(v).
k }, and V0 = {vk+1, . . . , vn} with
i(v+
for all j = 1, . . . , k and i(vj) = vj for all j = k + 1, . . . , n. Given a sym-
metric labeled bigraph B, we would like to construct its dual symmetric labeled bigraph
B∗ = (G∗, i∗, U+, U0, U−, ρ∗, X ∗). This dual symmetric labeled bigraph is deﬁned via the
following rules. First, for each vertex vj of B that is ﬁxed by i we introduce two vertices u+
j
and u−
j of B that are mapped to each other by
i, we introduce just one vertex uj of B. Thus
U0 = {u1, . . . , uk}; U+ = {u+

j of B∗, and for every two vertices v+

n}; U− = {u−

k+1, . . . , u−
n}.

The involution i∗ is deﬁned by i∗(uj) = uj for j = 1, . . . , k and i∗(u+
for j =
k + 1, . . . , n. Deﬁne U := U+ ⊔ U0 ⊔ U− to be the set of vertices of G∗. The labeling ρ∗ is
such that

j ) = u−

j ) = ρ∗(u−

j ) = √2ρ(v−

j ), for j = 1, . . . , k;
j ) = ρ(vj)/√2, for j = k + 1, . . . , n.

Finally, let us deﬁne the bigraph G∗ = (Γ∗, ∆∗). Note that since i preserves the color of the
vertices, v+

j are never connected by an edge in G.

j and v−

We construct Γ∗ and X ∗ ∩ Γ∗ by the following set of rules (which is 180◦-symmetric):

(vi, vj) ∈ Γ, (vi, vj) ∈ X ⇐⇒ (u+
(vi, vj) ∈ Γ, (vi, vj) 6∈ X ⇐⇒ (u+
i , vj) ∈ Γ ⇐⇒ (u+

j ) ∈ Γ∗

i , uj) ∈ Γ∗

j ) ∈ Γ ⇐⇒ (ui, uj) ∈ Γ∗, (ui, uj) 6∈ X ∗
j ) ∈ Γ ⇐⇒ (ui, uj) ∈ Γ∗, (ui, uj) ∈ X ∗.

The deﬁnition of ∆∗ and X ∗ ∩ ∆∗ is completely analogous. Thus we have deﬁned B∗, the
dual of a symmetric labeled bigraph B. It immediately follows from the construction that B∗
is also a symmetric labeled bigraph and that (B∗)∗ = B. We deﬁne a symmetric unlabeled
bigraph to be a six-tuple b = (G, i, V+, V0, V−, X) satisfying the conditions above (so we omit
the labeling ρ). The construction of the dual restricts to symmetric unlabeled bigraphs with
the same property that (b∗)∗ = b.
Example 9.2. Let b = (A2n−1, i, V+, V0, V−,∅) be a symmetric unlabeled bigraph of type
A2n−1. That is, ∆ = ∅ and i is the involution described in Section 1.3.1. Then from the above
discussion it follows that b∗ = (Dn+1, i, U+, U0, U−,∅) is a symmetric unlabeled bigraph of
type Dn+1, see Figure 14. Here,

More elaborate examples will be considered in Section 9.2.

|V+| = |V−| = |U0| = n − 1.

Proposition 9.3. Let B := (G, i, V+, V0, V−, ρ, X) be a symmetric labeled bigraph, let B∗ =
(G∗, i∗, U+, U0, U−, ρ∗, X ∗) be its dual. Let vi ∈ V0 be a vertex ﬁxed by i. Deﬁne λ : V → R
and λ∗ : U → R so that

λ(vj) = ρ(vj); λ(v±

j ) = ρ(v±

j ); λ∗(uj) = ρ∗(uj); λ∗(u±

j ) = ρ∗(u±
j )

for all j 6= i and

In other words, λ (resp., λ∗) is a result of a tropical mutation at vertex vi (resp., at vertices
i , u−
u+
i ). Then the bigraphs (G, i, V+, V0, V−, λ, X) and (G∗, i∗, U+, U0, U−, λ∗, X ∗) are also
dual to each other.
Proof. We only need to show that λ(vi) = √2λ∗(u+
i ). We already know that the same holds
for ρ(vi), so it remains to show that the right hand side of (9.1) is √2 times greater than
the right hand side of (9.2). Consider a vertex w such that (w, vi) ∈ Γ. If w ∈ V0 then
it means that there are two vertices w+ and w− in G∗ such that either (w+, u+
i ) ∈ Γ∗ or
(w−, u+
i ) ∈ Γ∗, but not both. Thus the contribution of w to the sum is ρ(w) while the
combined contribution of w+ and w− is ρ(w+) = ρ(w)/√2. Now, if w ∈ V+ or w ∈ V− then
ρ(w) = ρ(w∗)/√2 where w∗ is the vertex of U0 that corresponds to both w and i(w). Since
ρ(w∗) = √2ρ(w), we are done again.

(cid:3)

Since the tropical T -system consists of applying tropical mutations to the vertices of G,

we get an immediate corollary:
Corollary 9.4. Let B := (G, i, V+, V0, V−, ρ, X) be a symmetric labeled bigraph, let B∗ =
(G∗, i∗, U+, U0, U−, ρ∗, X ∗) be its dual. Assume that both G and G∗ are recurrent. Then

Since we would like to show that N can be set to h(G) + h′(G), and we already know that

for tensor products, the following proposition will be useful later.

26

PAVEL GALASHIN AND PAVLO PYLYAVSKYY

Proposition 9.5. Let B := (G, i, V+, V0, V−, ρ, X) be a symmetric labeled bigraph, let B∗ =
(G∗, i∗, U+, U0, U−, ρ∗, X ∗) be its dual. If G and G∗ are admissible ADE bigraphs then the
corresponding Coxeter numbers of G and G∗ from Proposition 1.8 are equal:

h(G) = h(G∗);

h′(G) = h′(G∗).

Proof. The involution i either maps each connected component C of Γ isomorphically onto
another connected component of Γ (then the corresponding connected component of Γ∗ will
be isomorphic to them as well) or it maps C onto itself via one of the maps described in
Section 1.3.1.
(cid:3)

9.2. Reduction to tensor products. We roughly describe our strategy of using Corol-
lary 9.4. Consider a bigraph G belonging to one of the three remaining inﬁnite families. We
will ﬁnd two involutions i and j on G such that Fix(i)∪ Fix(j) = Vert(G). Now, if u ∈ Fix(i)
is ﬁxed by i then δu is an i-symmetric labeling. Then we will ﬁnd two sets Xi and Xj of
edges that make (G, i) into a symmetric unlabeled bigraph whose dual is a tensor product
of Dynkin diagrams. Since in this case the tropical T -system has already been shown to
be periodic in [10], we can deduce that tδu
v (t), where 2N is the period of the
corresponding T -system and u ∈ Fix(i). Applying the same construction to j, we get that
v (t) is periodic for all u ∈ Fix(i) ∪ Fix(j) = Vert(G).
We formulate this strategy as a proposition:

v (t + 2N) = tδu

9.2.1. The case of (Am−1D)n. Let bi = ((Am−1D)n, i, V i
−, Xi) be as follows. Distin-
guish two common vertices v+
1 of the two single color subdiagrams of type D, see
Figure 15 for an example. Deﬁne i to be the involution that swaps v+
1 and ﬁxes all
other vertices. Denote the rest of the vertices of blue Dm+1 by v2m+1 through v3m−1, and
denote the adjacent vertices of the blue copy of A2m−1 by v2 through v2m. Finally, let

The construction of the dual b∗ is shown in Figure 15. It is clear that one gets A2n−1⊗A2m−1.
In order to apply Proposition 9.6, we need to deﬁne an involution j. It ﬂips the graph in
Figure 15 on the left horizontally except that it ﬁxes v+
1 . In this case, Xj consists
of only one edge (v2m+1, v+
1 ) and the dual symmetric unlabeled bigraph will be of type
Dn+1 ⊗ Dm+1, so we are done.

Alternatively, we could avoid introducing j as follows. By Corollary 9.4, we know that

We are going to make use of the involution for E6 in Figure 3. The involution i acts on
the special copy of E6. The involution j acts on the n − 1 non-special copies of E6. Let

for arbitrary vertices u, v ∈ Vert(Q). This can easily be done and is not computation
intensive by computer standards2. For example, one veriﬁcation for the case of D6∗D6 would
run as in Figure 23. A complete veriﬁcation for the case A3 ⊗ A1 was done in Example 1.9.

2Indeed, for each exceptional quiver Q with d vertices, one needs to perform O(d2 · 2(h(Q) + h′(Q)))
arithmetic operations. For the largest graph E8 ∗ E8 ≡ E8 ≡ E8, we have d = 32 and h = h′ = 30. Checking
periodicity for all the eight cases takes less than a second on a standard oﬃce computer.
