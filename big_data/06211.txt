TANGENT LIE GROUPS ARE RIEMANNIAN NATURALLY REDUCTIVE

SPACES

ILKA AGRICOLA AND ANA CRISTINA FERREIRA

Abstract. Given a compact Lie group G with Lie algebra g, we consider its tangent Lie group
T G ∼= G⋉Ad g. In this short note, we prove that T G admits a left-invariant naturally reductive
Riemannian metric g and a metric connection with skew torsion ∇ such that (T G, g, ∇) is
naturally reductive. An alternative spinorial description of the same connection on the direct
product G × g generalizes in a rather subtle way to T S 7, which is in many senses almost a
tangent Lie group.

1. Introduction

Among all homogenous Riemannian manifolds, naturally reductive spaces are a class of particular
interest. Traditionally, they are deﬁned as Riemannian manifolds (M = G/K, g) with a reductive
complement m of k in g such that

(1)

h[X, Y ]m, Zi + hY, [X, Z]mi = 0 for all X, Y, Z ∈ m,

where h−, −i denotes the inner product on m induced from g. For any reductive homogeneous
space, the submersion G → G/K induces a connection that is called the canonical connection.
It is a metric connection ∇ with torsion T (X, Y ) = −[X, Y ]m which satisﬁes ∇T = ∇R = 0,
and condition (1) thus states that a naturally reductive homogeneous space is a reductive space
for which the torsion T (X, Y, Z) := g(T (X, Y ), Z) is a 3-form on G/K (see [KN69, Ch. X]
as a general reference). Classical examples of naturally reductive homogeneous spaces include
irreducible symmetric spaces, isotropy irreducible homogeneous manifolds, Lie groups with a
bi-invariant metric, and Riemannian 3-symmetric spaces.
In the recent article [AFF15], the authors together with Thomas Friedrich (Berlin) initiated a
systematic investigation and, in dimension six, achieved the classiﬁcation of naturally reductive
homogeneous spaces. This is done by applying recent results and techniques from the holonomy
theory of metric connections with skew torsion. Lie Groups (and spheres) appearing in the
classiﬁcation always play a special role because they may admit several naturally reductive
structures (see [OR12], [OR13] for details on these rather subtle points). The motivation for
this paper was to describe explicitly the naturally reductive structure on S3 ⋉ R3 discovered in
[AFF15], and to investigate whether it can be generalized. This turned out not to be as straight
forward as expected. In fact, while a lot is known about left-invariant naturally reductive metrics
on compact Lie groups (see [AZ79], [Ch16]), much less information is available on non-compact Lie
groups (C. Gordon gives a general description of naturally reductive nilmanifolds in [Go85], the
more recent article [AFS15] investigates quaternionic Heisenberg groups as naturally reductive
spaces). Instead of the traditional approach, we shall often work with the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 1.1. A Riemannian manifold (M, g) is said to be naturally reductive if it is a homo-
geneous space M = G/K endowed with a metric connection ∇ with skew torsion T such that
its torsion and curvature R are ∇-parallel, i. e. ∇T = ∇R = 0. The connection ∇ will then be
called the Ambrose-Singer connection or, loosely, the naturally reductive structure of (M, g).

If M is connected, complete, and simply connected, a theorem of Ambrose and Singer asserts
that the space is indeed naturally reductive in the traditional sense [AS58].

In this note, we prove that the tangent bundle T G ∼= G ⋉Ad g of a compact Lie group G
with Lie algebra g admits a left-invariant naturally reductive Riemannian metric g and a metric
connection with skew torsion ∇ such that (T G, g, ∇) is naturally reductive. Furthermore, we will
deﬁne a suitable almost Hermitian structure on T G such that ∇ is its characteristic connection
[FI02, Ag06]. An alternative spinorial description of the same connection on the direct product
G × g generalizes in a rather subtle way to T S7, which is in some sense almost a tangent Lie
group. Our construction will make use of the following well-known fact.

Remark 1.2. A compact Lie group G of dimension n endowed with a bi-invariant metric admits
an orthonormal basis e1, . . . , en of g such that its structure constants C k
ij , deﬁned by [ei, ej] =
ij ek, are totally skew-symmetric in all indices. All structure constants on compact Lie

groups appearing in this paper will be chosen in this way.

It is well known that G itself carries a family of naturally reductive structures whose torsion
a multiple of T (X, Y, Z) := h[X, Y ], Zi—which is indeed a 3-form by the structure constants’
property that we just described [CSch26a, KN69]. Naively, it is this antisymmetry property
that allows us to deﬁne canonical 3-forms on T G as well, which are then candidates for torsion
tensors. However, the picture is more sophisticated than this. We emphasize that our metric is
neither a product metric, a g-natural metric (see Remark 2.6) nor a warped product metric or of
any ‘general’ known type. We ﬁnd it rather surprising that this rather ‘asymmetric’ metric has
any special properties at all, and we believe that it is worth investigating its occurrence further.

2. Tangent Lie groups as naturally reductive spaces

2.1. The Lie group SU(2) ⋉ R3. In [AFF15, Theorems 8.9, 8.12], we proved the following
classiﬁcation result for 6-dimensional naturally reductive spaces and, more generally, spaces with
parallel skew torsion:

Theorem 2.1. Let (M 6, g, T ) be a complete, simply connected Riemannian 6-manifold with a
metric connection ∇ with parallel skew torsion T , rk (∗σT ) = 6 and ker T = 0. Then one of the
following cases occurs:

Case D.1: (M 6, g) is isometric to a nearly K¨ahler 6-manifold.
Case D.2: hol∇ = so(3) ⊂ su(3), the manifold (M 6, g) is naturally reductive, almost
Hermitian of Gray-Hervella type W1 ⊕ W3, and isometric to one of the following Lie
groups with a suitable family of left-invariant metrics:
(a) The nilpotent Lie group with Lie algebra R3×R3 with commutator [(v1, w1), (v2, w2)] =

(0, v1 × v2) (see [Sch07]),

(b) the direct or the semidirect product of S3 with R3,
(c) the product S3 × S3 (described in Section [AFF15, 9.4]),
(d) the Lie group SL(2, C) viewed as a 6-dimensional real manifold (described in Section

[AFF15, 9.5]).

Case (b) turned out to be rather non-intuitive and was therefore not described any further. In
the proof, S3 = SU(2) appeared as the isometry group of the 3-dimensional Euclidean space. We
start by giving an explicit description of this space, and afterwards a generalisation of it.
Recall that our Ansatz was as follows: (M 6, g, T ) is a complete, simply connected Riemannian 6-
manifold with parallel skew torsion T such that rk(∗σT ) = 6 and kerT = 0. In [AFF15, Theorem
8.9, case D.2], it is proved that there is a local orthonormal frame {e1, · · · , e6} such that the
torsion form can be written as
(2) T = α e135 + α′ e246 + β (e245 + e236 + e146), hence σT = β(β − α) (e1256 + e1234 + e3456)

and the curvature is given by

(3)

R = β(α − β) [(e35 + e46)2 + (e15 + e26)2 + (e13 + e24)2]

with β 6= 0 and α 6= β to ensure that ∗σT deﬁnes an almost complex structure. Our group G
corresponds to the parameters α, α′ and β such that α 6= 2β and 4β(α − 2β) − α′2 = 0.
Here is the explicit realization of SU(2) ⋉ R3. Let {f1, f2, f3} be the canonical basis of R3 and
{e12, e13, e23} be the standard basis of the Lie algebra su(2) = Λ2R3. Consider real parameters
a, b 6= 0 and the basis of su(2) ⋉ R3 given by

x1 = a(e12, 0), x3 = a(e13, 0), x5 = a(e23, 0), x2 = (be12, f3), x4 = (be13, −f2), x6 = (be23, f1).

with the following commutator relations given by the structure of semi-direct product

[x1, x3] = ax5,

[x5, x1] = ax3,

[x3, x5] = ax1,

[x2, x4] = 2bx6 − b2
[x6, x2] = 2bx4 − b2
[x4, x6] = 2bx2 − b2

a x1,

a x5,

a x3,

[x1, x4] = [x2, x3] = ax6,

[x6, x1] = [x5, x2] = ax4,

[x3, x6] = [x4, x5] = ax2.

We deﬁne an almost Hermitian structure (G, g, J) (indexed to the parameters a and b) such
that x1, . . . , x6 are an orthonormal basis of the Riemannian metric g and the almost complex
structure J is such that its fundamental form is given by Ω = −(x12 + x34 + x56); here and in
the sequel, we will write xijk for xi ∧ xj ∧ xk, etc. We now compute the torsion form of the
characteristic connection of (g, J). The Nijenhuis tensor of J is easily seen to be

NJ = (cid:18)a −

b2

a (cid:19) x135 + 2b(x136 + x145 + x235) − 2bx246 +(cid:18) b2

− a(cid:19) (x146 + x236 + x245)

and the twisted derivative of Ω is

dJ Ω = 3

b2
a

x135 + a(x245 + x236 + x146) − 2b(x235 + x145 + x136)

and thus the characteristic torsion is [FI02, Ag06]

b2

a (cid:19) x135 − 2bx246 +

(x146 + x236 + x245).

The connections forms are easily computed to be

Λ(xi) = (cid:18)a +

b2

a (cid:19) Hi

for i = 1, 3, 5 and Λ(xj ) = 0 for j = 2, 4, 6,

where H1 = x35 + x46, −H3 = x15 + x26 and H5 = x13 + x24. These elements satisfy the bracket
relations [H1, H3] = H5, [H5, H1] = H3 and [H3, H5] = H1, which means that the characteristic
connection has holonomy algebra su(2), as it should. The curvature is then a constant multiple
of the projection onto the holonomy algebra, namely

(5)

R =

b2
a2 (a2 + b2)[H1 ⊗ H1 + H3 ⊗ H3 + H5 ⊗ H5].

It is a simple calculation to verify that ∇T = ∇R = 0 so, indeed, G = SU(2) ⋉ R3 is equipped
with a two-parameter family of naturally reductive metrics. Comparing our explicit formulas of
Eq. 4 and Eq. 5 with the Ansatz of Eq. 2 and Eq. 3, if we take α = a + 2 b2
a and α′ = 2b
then indeed (α′)2 − 4β(α − 2β) = 0 and β(α − β) = b2
a2 (a2 + b2) so our computations check out.
Remark 2.2. In fact, more can be said about the almost complex structure of the examples
occurring in Case D.2 of Theorem 2.1. The U(3) structure turns out to be an SU(3) structure,
hence it may be deﬁned by a real spinor ϕ of constant length [ACFH15]. A computer-aided
computation reveals that ϕ satisﬁes the equation

where the last summand anticommutes with J. Therefore, these three summands are the χ1,

where ˜ϕ is a second spinor linearly independent of ϕ. We see that if α′ = 0, then ϕ is an

2.2. The semidirect product T G = G ⋉Ad g. Our aim is now to show how the previous
example can be generalized to a construction that starts with any compact Lie group endowed
with a bi-invariant metric.
Let N and H be two connected Lie groups, ϕ : H → Aut(N ) a non-trivial group homomorphism,
and assume that N is abelian. The semidirect product of H and N with respect to ϕ, denoted
H ⋉ϕ N , is the manifold H × N endowed with the multiplication

(h1, n1)(h2, n2) = (h1h2, n1 + ϕ(h1)n2) for all h1, h2 ∈ H and n1, n2 ∈ N.

At the Lie algebra level, we have an induced map ϕ∗ : h → End(n) and the bracket of two
elements (A, u), (B, v) ∈ h ⊕ n is

[(A, u), (B, v)] = ([A, B], ϕ∗(A)(v) − ϕ∗(B)(u)).

Since N is abelian, n is just a vector space with trivial Lie bracket. We shall shortly construct
explicitly a left-invariant metric on H ⋉ϕ N for some particular choice of H and N . Instead of
checking manually that it is not bi-invariant, let us quickly prove that, more generally, H ⋉ϕ N
does not admit any bi-invariant metrics at all.

Lemma 2.3. The semidirect product H ⋉ϕ N does not admit bi-invariant Riemannian metrics.

Proof. Left-invariant Riemannian metrics always exist, as they can be identiﬁed with positive
deﬁnite scalar products on h ⊕ n; let h, i be one such product. Since H ⋉ϕ N is connected, h, i
will be bi-invariant if and only if ad X is a skew-symmetric endomorphism for any X ∈ h ⊕ n.
Let A ∈ h, u ∈ n be such that ϕ∗(A)u =: v 6= 0; this is possible, since we assumed ϕ non-trivial.
Then

0 < h(0, v), (0, v)i = h(0, ϕ∗(A)u), (0, v)i = h[(A, 0), (0, u)], (0, v)i

= −h[(0, u), (A, 0)], (0, v)i = +h(A, 0), [(0, u), (0, v)]i = 0,

since N is abelian. This yields a contradiction and ﬁnishes the proof.

(cid:3)

TANGENT LIE GROUPS

By a classical result of Milnor [Mi76], bi-invariant metrics exist only on groups isomorphic to
a direct product of a compact Lie group and a vector space (viewed as an abelian group), so
actually our proof implies that H ⋉ϕ N is not isomorphic to such a product.1

Deﬁnition 2.4. The Lie group G ⋉Ad g obtained when choosing H = G any connected Lie
group, N = g its Lie algebra (viewed as an abelian Lie group with respect to addition) and
ϕ = Ad : G → GL(g) the adjoint representation will be called the tangent Lie group of G and
will be denoted by T G.

Of course, T G is indeed the tangent bundle of G. The geometry of tangent Lie groups is described
in [YK66a, YK66b] and [Se86]. The Lie algebra of T G is spanned by the complete lifts and the
vertical lifts to T G of the left invariant vector ﬁelds on G, denoted by an upper index c and v
respectively,

Lie(T G) = {Ac + Bv : A, B ∈ g},

and their commutator structure coincides with that of Lie(G⋉Ad g) described above (see [YK66a]
for a proof),

[Ac, Bc] = [A, B]c,

[Av, Bv] = 0,

[Ac, Bv] = [A, B]v.

Hence, given a basis d1, . . . , dn of g, the 2n elements ei := dc
basis of Lie(T G) ∼= g ⋉ad g.
It is known that the complete lift of a semi-Riemannian metric g on M n to T M n is a semi-
Riemannian metric gc of split signature (n, n), and that a connection ∇ making (M n, g) a
naturally reductive space lifts to a connection ∇c that turns (T M n, gc) into a naturally reductive
space [YK66a, Propositions 6.3, 7.8], [Se86, Theorem 3.6]. Similar lifting results for constructing
general Riemannian metrics on T M n with a naturally reductive structure are unknown. We
shall construct such a metric in the case where M n = G is a Lie group.

i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) form a

i and fi := dv

Theorem 2.5. Let G be a compact connected Lie group equipped with a bi-invariant metric,
T G = G ⋉ad g its tangent group. Then there is a two parameter family ga,b (a, b ∈ R∗) of left-
invariant Riemannian metrics on T G such that T G is naturally reductive. More precisely, there
is a two parameter family of almost Hermitian structures of Gray-Hervella class W1 ⊕ W3 such
that their characteristic connection ∇, its torsion T , and curvature R, satisfy ∇T = ∇R = 0
and hol(∇) = [g, g].

Proof. Let n = dim G and {d1, · · · , dn} be an orthonormal basis of the Lie algebra g with
respect to the chosen bi-invariant metric, ei := dc
i their complete and vertical lifts,
respectively, as explained above (1 ≤ i ≤ n). We may assume that the structure constants C k
ij
are totally antisymmetric in all indices, see Remark 1.2.
We deﬁne a two-parameter family of left-invariant Riemannian metrics ga,b (a, b 6= 0) on T G by
setting the following elements of g ⋉ad g to be orthonormal

i and fi := dv

xi = aei

and

yi = bei + fi

(i = 1, . . . , n).

Also, we deﬁne an almost complex structure J on M by the two form

We have the following commutator relations

1As an aside, we observe that it is not diﬃcult to construct examples of semidirect products with ϕ non-trivial
and N non-abelian admitting bi-invariant metrics; as the proof goes, it is clear that these will have the property
hh, [n, n]i 6= 0, and by Milnor’s result, they are actually isomorphic (in a non-trivial way) to direct products.

whose coeﬃcient in front cannot be zero, since a and b are assumed to be non vanishing. Hence,

a constant multiple of the projection on the holonomy algebra, namely

R =

This immediately yields that both the torsion form and the curvature tensor are parallel w. r. t. ∇.
It remains to prove that the almost complex structure is of type W1 ⊕ W3. We already observed
that N is a skew symmetric so we only need to show that the W4 component vanishes, i.e.
δgΩ = 0. We use the formula (see [Ag06], for instance)

(6)

δgΩ = δ∇Ω +

(ei

for any orthonormal basis {e1, · · · , e2n} of M . Using our adapted basis {x1, y1, · · · , xn, yn} and
the fact that ∇ is the characteristic connection of (M, g, J), then we get that δgΩ = 0.
(cid:3)

Remark 2.6. This is not the canonical symplectic structure on T ∗G (since dΩ 6= 0). Observe
that the Hermitian form can also be written

Ω = −a

Thus, up to normalization the almost complex structure ‘rotates’ complete lifts of vector ﬁelds
into vertical lifts. This is similar in spirit to the almost complex structure already constructed
in [Do62], which acts in a similar way on horizontal (with respect to any aﬃne connection) and
vertical lifts.

TANGENT LIE GROUPS

However, the metric we constructed is not g-natural in any reasonable sense: Given an aﬃne
connection ∇ (usually the Levi-Civita connection of some Riemannian metric), recall that a
g-natural metric is a metric on T M for which the vertical and ∇-horizontal distribution are
orthogonal and the metric coincides with the original metric on horizontal lifts. But the vector
ﬁelds yi are not purely vertical, and there is no connection having the vector ﬁelds xi as horizontal
lifts.

Remark 2.7. We excluded b = 0 from the previous discussion; however, all formulas make
sense, so we can investigate what happens in this limiting case. The value b = 0 corresponds to
the direct product metric, but on the semidirect product Lie group, hence it is nevertheless only
left-invariant, in accordance to Lemma 2.3. For b = 0, we see that hol(∇) = 0 and R = 0, so the
connection is ﬂat. We will come back to this case in the next section.

Remark 2.8. Let us look more closely at the case where g has non-trivial center z of dimension
p > 0. We can assume that we chose our orthonormal basis such that the ﬁrst p elements
d1, . . . , dp span z. Then all corresponding structure constants C k
αj vanish, where α = 1, . . . , p,
and therefore Hα = 0 and

span (eα, fβ | α, β = 1, . . . , p) = ker T := {X ∈ Lie(T G) | X T = 0}.

Thus T has a 2p-dimensional kernel and the splitting theorem [AFF15, Thm 3.4] implies that
T G is locally a Riemannian product with vanishing torsion on one factor and torsion with trivial
kernel on the other factor. The case z 6= {0} may therefore be reduced to lower dimensional
examples. Furthermore, if G is semisimple but not simple its Lie algebra g splits as the sum of
n (n > 1) simple Lie algebras and clearly both the tangent group T G and the torsion form T
will also split into n summands, reducing again the problem to lower dimensional spaces. All
in all, we can conclude that the interesting cases are G simple: After the space M 6 = T SU(2)
described before, the next examples are M 16 = T SU(3) and M 28 = T G2.

2.3. The direct product G × g. We shall now prove that the metric β constructed on T G in
Theorem 2.5 is isometric to a left-invariant metric on the direct product G × g, despite the fact
that it is not isomorphic (as a Lie group) to G ⋉ g by Lemma 2.3.
First, let us describe the relevant metric on the direct product G × g. We assume, as in Theorem
2.5, that G is a connected Lie group of dimension n with bi-invariant metric, {e1, · · · , en} an
orthonormal basis of g with respect to this metric, and C k
ij the totally antisymmetric structure
constants of G.
We deﬁne a two-parameter family of left-invariant Riemannian metrics ˜β (depending again on
a, b ∈ R, a 6= 0) on G × g by setting the following elements of g ⊕ g to be orthonormal,

xi = (aei, 0)

and

yi = (bei, ei)

i = 1, . . . , n.

As an inner product on g ⊕ g, this coincides of course with the inner product deﬁned on g ⋉ad g
in Theorem 2.5. The case b = 0 corresponds now to the bi-invariant direct product metric on
G × g. For completeness, let us state the bracket relations given by the direct product structure,

Vector ﬁelds on G ⋉ g and G × g are deﬁned by left translation from their respective Lie algebras
(identiﬁed with the tangent space at the neutral element), so they are not the same on the set
G × g, because the group structures are diﬀerent – as can be seen from the diﬀering commutator
relations. However, the left translation operators starting from the neutral element (e, 0) on both
groups coincide. To see this, start with any point Y := (h, Y ) and consider the left translation
in T G (denoted by Ls) and in G × g (denoted by Ld) by any group element X := (g, X). The
letter L without index denotes the usual left translation in G respectively g (the actual formula
on g does not matter for the purpose here). The deﬁnition of the group multiplication in G ⋉ g

and G × g is equivalent to

Ls

X (Y) = (Lg(h), LX (Ad gY )), Ld

X (Y) = (Lg(h), LX(Y )).

X (e, 0) and Ld

Therefore, for Y = (e, 0), Ad g 0 = 0 and hence Ls
X (e, 0) coincide, and one easily
checks that their diﬀerential at (e, 0) coincide as well. Therefore, left translation by X maps
the origin to the same point in the set G × g regardless which group structure we consider. In
particular, there is a natural identiﬁcation of tangent spaces to T G and G × g at all points, and
the metrics β, ˜β coincide in each of these tangent spaces. Recall now that a diﬀeomorphism
f : T G = G ⋉ g → G × g is an isometry if βg,X (U, V ) = ˜βf (g,X)(dfg,X U, dfg,XV ). We choose
f (g, X) = (g, X) the identity, hence df = Id, and this becomes thus an isometry because of the
identiﬁcation of tangent spaces and metrics.

Remark 2.9. Within the set-up described above, deﬁne an almost complex structure on (G ×
g, ˜β) by the two form

Ω = −(x1 ∧ y1 + · · · + xn ∧ yn).

It is a straightforward computation to check that, up to sign, the characteristic torsion of this
almost complex structure is the same as the one described in the proof of Theorem 2.5. The
connection forms of the characteristic connection ∇ are expressed as

Λ(xi) = −

b2
a

n

Xj<k

C k

ij (xjk + yjk)

and

Λ(yi) = b

n

Xj<k

C k

ij (xjk + yjk),

One checks that the curvature tensor is given by the same expression as the in the proof of
Theorem 2.5. A similar argument yields that both the torsion form and the curvature tensor are
parallel with respect to ∇.
Now, we had just seen before that the metrics on T G and G × g corresponding to b = 0 are
isometric (compare Remark 2.7), and the connection ∇ is then ﬂat. By a Theorem of Cartan and
Schouten ([CSch26a], see also [AF10] for a modern proof), G ⋉ g with a ﬂat metric connection
had to be isometric to a Lie group with a bi-invariant metric, so we could have anticipated the
isometry at least in this special case.
Another argument to prove that (G ⋉ g, β) and (G × g, ˜β) are isometric is simply to use the
Nomizu construction, see [AFF15, Appendix A] or [TV83], since the expressions for the torsion
form and the curvature tensor are identical.

3. A peculiar connection on T S7

One might ask which are the crucial properties that make the construction of the metric con-
nection in Section 2 work. Certainly, the Lie group approach is straightforward and yields a
complete description in the well-known formalism of Lie groups and Lie algebras.
A diﬀerent look at G× g is to observe that both factors carry a remarkable ﬂat metric connection
— the former one of the two ﬂat Cartan-Schouten connections (for the biinvariant metric), the
latter the usual Levi-Civita connection (for the standard euclidean metric). By the theorem of
Cartan and Schouten mentioned before [CSch26a, AF10], the only irreducible manifold carrying
a ﬂat metric connection ∇ with skew torsion T that is neither a Lie group nor a vector space
is the sphere S7. Leaving ﬂat vector spaces aside, the crucial diﬀerence between a compact Lie
group and S7 lies in the behaviour of the torsion: for Lie groups, ∇T = 0, while on the 7-sphere,
the torsion T fails to be parallel [AF10, p.484].
We shall sketch how this point of view yields a remarkable connection on T S7 and where dif-
ferences appear. First we summarize the construction of the ﬂat metric connection with skew
torsion on S7. In dimension 7, the complex Spin(7)-representation ∆C
7 is the complexiﬁcation of
a real 8-dimensional representation κ : Spin(7) → End(∆7), since the real Cliﬀord algebra C(7)
is isomorphic to M(8) ⊕ M(8). Thus, we may identify R8 with the vector space ∆7 and embed
therein the sphere S7 as the set of all spinors of length one (h·, ·i is the euclidean scalar product

TANGENT LIE GROUPS

on ∆7 = R8). Fix your favourite explicit realization of the spin representation by skew matrices,
κi := κ(ei) ∈ so(8) ⊂ End(R8), i = 1, . . . , 7. Deﬁne vector ﬁelds V1, . . . , V7 on S7 by

Vi(x) = κi · x for x ∈ S7 ⊂ ∆7.

From the antisymmetry of κ1, . . . , κ7, one easily deduces that the vector ﬁelds V1(x), . . . , V7(x)
deﬁne a global orthonormal frame on S7 consisting of Killing vector ﬁelds. The connection ∇ on
S7 is then deﬁned by the requirement ∇Vi(x) = 0. This connection is trivially ﬂat and metric,
and its torsion coeﬃcients are given by (i 6= j)

T (Vi, Vj, Vk)(x) = −h[Vi(x), Vj (x)], Vki = −2hκiκjx, κkxi = 2hκiκjκkx, xi =: τijk(x).

Of course, the coeﬃcients τijk(x) are not constant, reﬂecting that T is not parallel. The Killing
orthonormal frame V1(x), . . . , V7(x) does not form a Lie algebra; rather,

(7)

[Vi(x), Vj (x)] = [κi, κj](x) = 2 κiκjx = −Xk

τijk(x)Vk(x)

for i 6= j.

The antisymmetric functions τijk(x) replace (up to sign) the structure constants C k
ij of the Lie
group approach. These commutators [Vi(x), Vj (x)] are, of course, again Killing vector ﬁelds, but
not of constant length; however, they span a Lie algebra isomorphic to spin(7) ⊂ so(8).
Now choose the frame fi := ∂/∂zi with respect to standard euclidean coordinates z1, . . . , z7 on
R7, which is of course orthonormal for the euclidean scalar product. Formally, the vector ﬁelds Vi
and fi obey commutator relations similar to the direct product situation described in Subsection
2.3. Introduce global vector ﬁelds on S7 × R7 ∋ (x, z) by

Xi(x, z) = (aVi(x), 0),

Yi(x, z) = (bVi(x), fi),

i = 1, . . . , 7 (a, b ∈ R, a 6= 0)

and deﬁne – just as before – a Riemannian metric g on S7 × R7 by requiring that these are

orthonormal, and an almost complex structure via the Hermitian form Ω = −P Xi∧Yi. Similarly

to the direct product case, the following bracket relations hold (we omit the base point (x, z)),

[Xi, Xj] = −a

[Xi, Yj] = −b

The Nijenhuis tensor of the almost hermitian structure is the skew-symmetric tensor

τijkXkYij + 3

b2

Thus the characteristic torsion of this almost hermitian structure is given by

τijkXijk − 2b Xi<j<k
˜T on S7 × R7 is given by

∇Zi Xj =

As on S7 itself, the torsion ˜T is not parallel, but ∇X ˜T (Y, Z, V ) is antisymmetric in all arguments,
hence the curvature operator R is a symmetric operator Λ2(T S7) → Λ2(T S7) (see [Ag06, Remark
2.3] for details on this curvature argument). In fact, one computes

R =

4b2
a2 (a2 + b2)(H1 ⊗ H1 + · · · Hn ⊗ Hn).

Together with the property (7), this implies that ∇ has holonomy spin(7).

Appendix A. The two-fold product G × G

We now discuss brieﬂy the compact case. The direct product G × G also has families of naturally
reductive structures – we sketch the construction to emphasize how this compares to the case
described in Section 2. This is an explicit version of the constructions from [AZ79]; it generalizes
the S3 × S3 example given in [AFF15, Section 9.4], see case (c) in Theorem 2.1.

Theorem A.1. Let G be a connected compact Lie group with bi-invariant metric. The group
G×G can be equipped with a ﬁve-parameter family of left invariant naturally reductive structures.
More precisely, G×G can be endowed with a family of almost complex structures of type W1 ⊕W3
such that its characteristic connection satisﬁes ∇T = ∇R = 0 and hol(∇) is either [g, g] or trivial.

Proof. We realise G × G as the homogeneous space K/L, where K = G × G × G and L = ∆G is
embedded into K diagonally. Let k = g ⊕ g ⊕ g be the Lie algebra of K and ∆g = {(X, X, X) :
X ∈ g} be the Lie algebra of ∆G. Consider the following ∆g-modules

m1 = {(X, aX, bX) : a, b ∈ R, X ∈ g}, m2 = {(Y, cY, dY ) : c, d ∈ R, Y ∈ g}, m = m1 ⊕ m2.

One checks that m is a reductive complement of ∆g inside k if and only if

∆ := (a − 1)(d − 1) − (b − 1)(c − 1) 6= 0.

Let B denote the negative Killing form on g and deﬁne an inner product on m, for each parameter
λ > 0, as

h(X1 + Y1, aX1 + cY1, bX1 + dY1), (X2 + Y2, aX2 + cY2, bX2 + dY2)i = B(X1, X2) +

1
λ2 B(Y1, Y2).

We deﬁne also an almost complex structure J on m by

J((X, aX, bX) + (Y, cY, dY )) = −

1
λ

(Y, aY, bY ) + λ(X, cX, dX).

Let e1, . . . , en be an orthonormal basis of g with antisymmetric structure constants C k
also the elements

ij . Consider

xi = (ei, aei, bei)

and

yi = (ei, cei, dei),

i = 1, . . . , n.

The sets {xi} and {yi} are bases of m1 and m2, respectively. Remark that J is given, in the basis
{xi, yi} of m, by the 2-form Ω = −(x1 ∧ y1 + · · · + xn ∧ yn). Finally, let hi = (ei, ei, ei). The
isotropy representation λ : h −→ so(m) is given by

λ(hi) = Xj<k

C k

ij (xj xk + yjyk) := Hi.

The structure of so(m) together with the Jacobi identity in g imply that [Hi, Hj] = Pn

ij Hk.
The commutator structure is somewhat complicated. For ease of notation we introduce the

k=1 C k

following coeﬃcients

TANGENT LIE GROUPS

11

α = − 2

γ = − 2

∆ ((a2 − 1)(d − 1) − (b2 − 1)(c − 1))
∆ (a(d − b2) + a2(b − d) + (b2 − b)c)
∆ ((a − 1)(1 − bd) + (ac − 1)(b − 1))

σ = 2

ξ = − 2

θ = − 2

∆ (c − 1)(d − 1)(c − d)
∆ (d2(c − a) + c2(b − d) + (da − cb))

β = − 2

∆ (b − 1)(a − 1)(b − a)

δ = − 2

∆ (c(a(d − 1) − bd + 1) + (b − 1)d)

τ = 2

∆ (ac(d − b) + cb(1 − d) + ad(b − 1))
∆ ((d2 − 1)(a − 1) − (c2 − 1)(b − 1))

η = − 2

Then we can write the nonvanishing brackets of elements of m as

[xi, xj] = Pn
[yi, yj] = Pn

k=1 C k
k=1 C k

λ yk + γhk),

ij (µxk + ν
ij(λ2ξxk + ληyk + λ2θhk).

[xi, yj] = Pn

k=1 C k

ij (λδxk + σyk + λτ hk),

The Nijenhuis tensor N is totally skew-symmetric and given by

N = Xi<j<k
+ (cid:20) β

λ

C k

ij(cid:20)[λ2ξ + 2σ − α](xijk − (xiyjk + yixjyk + yijxk)) +
+ λ(2δ − η)(cid:21) (yijk − (yixjk + xiyjxk + xij yk))(cid:21) .

We can also compute that

dcΩ = Xi<j<k

C k

ij (cid:20)−3λ2ξxijk − 3

β
λ

yijk + (2σ − α)(xiyjk + yixj yk + yijxk)

+λ(2δ − η)(yixjk + xiyjxk + xij yk)(cid:21).

Therefore the torsion tensor T = N + dcΩ is given by

T = Pi<j<k C k

ij h[−2λ2ξ + 2σ − α]xijk +h−2 β

λ + λ(2δ − η)i yijk − λ2ξ(xiyjk + yixjyk + yijxk)

− β

λ (yixjk + xiyjxk + xij yk)i .

The characteristic connection is given by the map Λ : m −→ so(m)

Λ(xi) = (−λ2ξ + σ)Hi, Λ(yi) = (cid:18)−

β
λ

+ λδ(cid:19) Hi,

i = 1, . . . n.

It is then a straightforward computation to check that ΛT = 0. As for the curvature tensor we
have that

R = Σ(H1 ⊗ H1 + · · · + Hn ⊗ Hn), with Σ :=

β2
λ2 + λ4ξ2 − λ2ξ(2σ − α) − β(2δ − η).

It is then also clear that ΛR = 0. Therefore we have a 5-parameter family of naturally reductive
spaces on G × G. We have R = 0 if and only if Σ = 0; This includes some particular cases
like (c = 1, b = 1), (a = 1, d = 1) and (c = d, a = b).
If Σ 6= 0
then hol(∇) = [g, g]. For all parameters, δgΩ = 0, so the almost Hermitian structure is of type
W1 ⊕ W3.
(cid:3)

In this case, hol(∇) = 0.
