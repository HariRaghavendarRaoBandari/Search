We discuss models involving two scalar ﬁelds coupled to classical gravity that satisfy the general
criteria: (i) the theory has no mass input parameters, (ii) classical scale symmetry is broken only
through − 1
12 ςφ2R couplings where ς departs from the special conformal value of 1; (iii) the Planck
mass is dynamically generated by the vacuum expectations values (VEVs) of the scalars (iv) there is
a stage of viable inﬂation associated with slow roll in the two–scalar potential; (v) the ﬁnal vacuum
has a small to vanishing cosmological constant and an hierarchically small ratio of the VEVs and
the ratio of the scalar masses to the Planck scale. This assumes the paradigm of classical scale
symmetry as a custodial symmetry of large hierarchies.

The discovery of the weakly interacting Brout-Englert-
Higgs (BEH) boson, coupled with the absence of signif-
icant evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model,
has stimulated a re-evaluation of the possible explana-
tions of the hierarchy problem. In the Standard Model
(SM) of the strong and electroweak interactions, which
has no fundamental input mass scale other than the BEH
mass, an apparent hierarchy problem arises that is due
to the additive quadratically divergent radiative correc-
tions to the mass squared of the BEH boson. However,
in the pure Standard Model the quadratic divergences
are an artifact of the introduction of a mass scale cut-oﬀ
in momentum space [1]. In the context of ﬁeld theory,
the coeﬃcients of relevant operators have to be renor-
malised and the theory is deﬁned ultimately by observ-
able renormalised coeﬃcients.
In this case neither the
quadratically divergent radiative correction to the BEH
mass nor the mass counter-term is measurable and only
the renormalised mass is physically meaningful.
If one
maintains scale invariance broken only explicitly by the
various trace anomalies and spontaneously to generate
the BEH boson mass, then the latter must be viewed as
multiplicatively renormalized since no quadratic diver-
gence arises in the trace anomaly. This has further led
to the proposal of classically-scale-invariant models that
contain the SM, in which the electroweak scale is gen-
erated through spontaneous breaking of scale invariance
via Coleman-Weinberg mechanism [2, 3].

It has been suggested that scale invariance might even

apply at the quantum level through “endogenous” renor-
malisation which requires that the regulator mass scale,
µ, associated with quantum loops in dimensional regu-
larization, is itself generated by a moduli ﬁeld1. Alter-
natively, one can always introduce an arbitrary cut-oﬀ
scale Λ, e.g., by way of momentum space cut-oﬀ or Pauli-
Villars regularization, but then renormalize the theory at
a renormalization scale given by a moduli ﬁeld to remove
the Λ dependence2. However we will not explore this
possibility here, concentrating on whether it is possible
to build a viable scale invariant theory broken only spon-
taneously and via the trace anomaly.

Of course a complete theory must include gravity and,
if one is to maintain classical scale invariance, it is neces-
sary to do so in a way that generates the Planck scale
through spontaneous breaking of the scale invariance
such as occurs in the Brans Dicke theory of gravity [5].
The inclusion of gravity means there are additional addi-
tive divergent contributions to the BEH mass but these,
too, are unphysical and should be absorbed in the renor-
malised mass which vanishes if the underlying theory is
classically scale invariant.

In this paper we construct a spontaneously broken
scale-free model. As such, there is no physical meaning

1 For a recent discussion of this see [4]
2 It is easy to see that if one subtracts at some mass scale M that
is speciﬁed externally to the deﬁning ﬁeld theory action, then the
trace anomaly arises as the variation of the renormalized action
wrt ln(M ). In replacing the subtraction scale M by an actual
ﬁeld χ that is part of the deﬁning action of the theory, there
is no residual trace anomaly; the trace anomaly is simply ab-
sorbed into the improved stress tensor itself, which then remains
traceless.

To obtain the normal form of the Einstein equations at
late times, M 2 must be positive and therefore at least
one of the coeﬃcients α or β must be negative, inconsis-
tent with the conformally invariant choice. However the
resultant theory is still scale-independent. Taking the

We now restrict the analysis to study the cosmologi-

Such a theory has remarkable properties that we illus-
trate for one representative choice of parameters (α, β,
λ, ξ, δ) in Figure 1. At early times it has a period of
inﬂation during which, as we will show later on, observa-
tionally viable spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations
can be generated. Furthermore, it has an infra-red (IR)
ﬁxed point set by ratios of the coupling constants and
which is radiatively stable to quantum corrections and
during which the universe undergoes accelerated expan-
sion. The eﬀective planck mass, M 2 = M 2

Note that φS φ + χS χ = 0 is automatically satisﬁed since
our full potential, W (φ, χ), is classically scale invariant:

We are interested in the case that (cid:104)φ2

One can readily show that this is an IR stable ﬁxed point
so that (cid:104)φ0(cid:105), (cid:104)χ0(cid:105) are the IR vevs of the scalar ﬁelds.
Note that it is only dimensionless ratios of VEVs that are
physical. The absolute value of a VEV, not determined
by the static equations, is not measurable.
0(cid:105) so that,
at late times, a large hierarchy develops. To have an hi-
erarchically light “matter” sector also requires that the
χ mass should be small relative to the Planck scale and
this in turn requires that the χ mass contribution com-
ing from the δφ2χ2 term should be hierarchically small
relative to the Planck mass, i.e. δ ≤ (cid:104)χ2
0(cid:105). Finally
if the cosmological constant at late times is small then
this requires a ﬁne-tuning of the parameters in W such
that it is (or is close to) a perfect square. Furthermore,
we need λ ≤ (cid:104)χ4

term, is natural because φ is shift symmetric in the limit
the small parameters vanish. Thus the radiative correc-
tions to the small parameters can only be gravitational
in origin (we will discuss these corrections later in this
letter).

(where µ2 ≡ (cid:104)χ0(cid:105)2/(cid:104)φ0(cid:105)2) and we can deﬁne an eﬀective
cosmological constant Λeﬀ = (λ + ξµ4 + δµ2)φ2

βµ2). With the ordering of the couplings discussed above
Λef f ≤ ξχ4
0/M 2. To obtain zero cosmological constant
requires ﬁne tuning of the couplings corresponding to the
potential having the form of a perfect square.

This theory is equivalent to a multi-scalar Jordan-
Brans-Dicke theory of gravity with a potential [5–7]. Cur-
rent constraints on Brans-Dicke theories from Shapiro
time delay measurements are particularly stringent and a
naive application to this theory leads to α2 < 2.5× 10−5.
However, the particular scale invariant form of the poten-
tial W implies that (cid:3)φ = 0 at the ﬁxed point, implying
that it decouples from the “matter” ﬁeld, χ, suggesting
that the bound may not apply. Clearly this warrants a
more detailed study of quasi-static solutions in the pres-
ence of matter in a cosmological background, beyond the
scope of the current letter.

A remarkable feature of the scale-independent struc-
ture, that we see in Fig 1, is that it readily leads to an
inﬂationary era. Non-minimally coupled models of inﬂa-
tion have been looked at before [8–11]. Multiﬁeld, non-
minimal models have also been looked at in some detail,

with a particular focus on models with an explicit Planck
mass [12] or perfectly (or almost perfect) conformal in-
variance (with α = β = 1) [13].

However this case is characteristically diﬀerent, with
no explicit Planck mass and the slow-roll condition re-
sulting from a cancellation of terms due to the scale in-
variance of non-gravitational sector. To understand its
inﬂationary regime, it useful to rewrite Eq. 7 in terms of
χ. In the regime where W (cid:39) ξχ4, Eqs 7 gives

where M 2

at the end of inﬂation when M 2

checked that this solution is a superb approximation to
the numerical solution to Eqs 7.
With our analytical solution in hand, assuming that
at the beginning of inﬂation we have φ ∼ χ ∼ ΦI , we
ﬁnd that the total number of e-folding during inﬂation is
Ntot = −(1/ν) ln[(1 + γ)/(β/α + γ)]. This allows us to
determine the value of the eﬀective Planck mass today
as a function of MI = −αΦ2

If α, β (cid:28) 1 we have that M 2

to have Ntot → ∞.
We can also calculate the predictions for the in-

parameters,  = −H(cid:48) and η =  − (cid:48)/2, and then cal-
culate the tensor to scalar ratio, r = 16 and the scalar
spectra index, ns = 1 + 2η− 4. We then ﬁnd the expres-
sions:

where Ne is the number of e-foldings before inﬂation. To
obtain (r, ns) consistent with the Planck measurements
[15], i.e. r ≤ 0.1 and ns ∼ 0.96, we need νNe ∼ 1 which
means that α ∼ 10−2 for Ne ∼ 50 − 60. Future B-mode
constraints will further tighten bounds on r, leading to
a lower-bound on α. We have ignored the eﬀect of ﬂuc-
tuations in the φ which could in principal lead to addi-
tional isocurvature ﬂuctuations and non-negligable non-
Gaussian eﬀects [16]. A cursory analysis shows that the
curvature of the inﬂationary trajectories in ﬁeld space is
˙φ2/( ˙φ2 + ˙χ2) (cid:28) H 2) and hence we expect
small (i.e.
deviations from adiabiticity and gaussianity to be small
but a more in depth study is required.

The generation of a hierarchy requires that the choice
of parameters in the tree level Lagrangian is also hi-
erarchical and it is important to check whether this
choice is stable against radiative corrections. The choice
λ (cid:28) δ (cid:28) ξ is stable against non-gravitational correc-
tions because in the limit that λ and δ vanish there is an
enhanced shift symmetry φ → φ + c. This implies that
non-gravitational corrections to δ are proportional to δ
while the corrections to λ are proportional to δ2 or λ,
both being perturbatively small.

Gravitational corrections to scalar masses do not occur
if the scalar ﬁeld is shift symmetric. In the case of the
χ ﬁeld this shift symmetry is broken by its O(1) quartic
interaction proportional to ξ so one expects corrections
to its mass at two loop order involving both the grav-
itational coupling and ξ. However this contribution is
quadratically divergent and so unmeasurable. The di-
vergence is absorbed in the counter term and the renor-
malised mass vanishes due to the classical scale invari-
ance. The same is true of the mass generated for the χ
ﬁeld due to its shift breaking coupling to the Ricci scalar.
Turning to gravitational radiative corrections to the
φ mass and the δφ2χ2 coupling we note that any such
corrections must be inversely proportional to powers of
the eﬀective Planck scale set by the φ vev. As a result
there are no such corrections because any power of φ in
the numerator will be more than compensated by the
powers of φ in the denominator.

Thus we ﬁnd that the classical scale invariance is un-
broken by gravitational corrections. Indeed there are no
gravitational trace anomalies, trace anomalies being gen-
erated only by the non-gravitational couplings which do
not spoil the hierarchy. This result follows because the
theory in the IR has no heavy states with Planck scale
masses and so does not have a “real” hierarchy problem.
Indeed, if one employs the “endogenous” renormalisa-
tion mentioned in the introduction, the theory has no
such trace anomalies as it is scale invariant even at the
quantum level.

While the model is very simple, it should be possi-
ble to extend it to include the Standard Model states
with the χ vev coupled to the BEH scalar to provide the
electroweak scale3. Of course the SM states should have
hierarchically small coupling to the φ ﬁeld but such small
couplings will again be radiatively stable due to the en-
hanced symmetry when the couplings are zero. One prob-
lem with the scale independent approach applied to the
Standard Model is the presence of the Landau pole as-
sociated with the U (1) gauge group factor. This signals
that the SM becomes strongly interacting at the scale

4

associated with the Landau pole.
It is common to as-
sume that there will be massive bound states associated
with this strong interaction that will couple signiﬁcantly
to the BEH boson and create the “real” hierarchy prob-
lem4. One possible way to evade this is to embed the SM
in a theory with no Abelian gauge group factor that does
not have a Landau pole [17]. This must be done close to
the electroweak scale to avoid introducing the hierarchy
problem via new massive states and leads to a profusion
of new states that may be visible at the LHC. However
the Landau pole in the SM lies above the Planck scale
where gravitational eﬀects cannot be neglected and it is
far from clear clear what the physics above the Landau
pole will be and whether it indeed reintroduces the hi-
erarchy problem. For the same reason we did not insist
on the absence of a Landau pole in the model considered
here. Similarly it is possible that, when gravity becomes
strong, it leads to massive states that generate the real
hierarchy problem. However it is not know if this hap-
pens and, as with the Landau pole problem, we chose to
ignore this possibility here.

We have shown that a simple two-scalar model coupled
to gravity can satisﬁes the general criteria: (i) the theory
has no mass input parameters, i.e., is classically scale in-
variant; (ii) scale symmetry is broken only through the
scalar coupling to the Ricci scalar which depart from the
special conformal value of −1/6; (iii) the Planck mass is
dynamically generated by the scalar VEV’s (iv) there is
a viable stage of inﬂation associated with slow roll in the
two–scalar potential; (v) the ﬁnal vacuum has a small to
vanishing cosmological constant and an hierarchical ra-
tio between the Planck scale and the scalar mass scale.
Our analysis assumes the paradigm of classical scale sym-
metry as a custodial symmetry of large hierarchies and
we have argued that the hierarchies are preserved even
when quantum corrections are included. We will present
generalizations of this scheme to multi-scalar theories as
well as the inclusion of SM states and expand the formal
implications elsewhere [18].
