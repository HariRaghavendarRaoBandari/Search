ABSTRACT
Observations of 12CO(3-2) emission of the circumbinary envelope of Mira Ceti, made
by ALMA are analysed. The observed Doppler velocity distribution is made of three
components: a blue-shifted south-eastern arc, which can be described as a ring in slow
radial expansion, ∼1.7 km s−1, making an angle of ∼50◦ with the plane of the sky and
born some 2000 years ago; a few arcs, probably born at the same epoch as the blue-
shifted arc, all sharing Doppler velocities red-shifted by approximately 3±2 km s−1
with respect to the main star; the third, central region dominated by the circumbinary
envelope, displaying two outﬂows in the south-western and north-eastern hemispheres.
At short distances from the star, up to ∼1.5′′, these hemispheres display very diﬀerent
morphologies: the south-western outﬂow covers a broad solid angle, expands radially
at a rate between 5 and 10 km s−1 and is slightly red shifted; the north-eastern outﬂow
consists of two arms, both blue-shifted, bracketing a broad dark region where emission
is suppressed. At distances between ∼1.5′′ and ∼2.5′′ the asymmetry between the two
hemispheres is signiﬁcantly smaller and detached arcs, particularly spectacular in the
north-eastern hemisphere are present. Close to the stars, we observe a mass of gas
surrounding Mira B, with a size of a few tens of AU, and having Doppler velocities
with respect to Mira B reaching ±1.5 km s−1, which we interpret as gas ﬂowing from
Mira A toward Mira B.

1 INTRODUCTION

Mira Ceti is one of the most studied binary stars. Its distance
from the Sun is estimated to be 107±10 pc from the Hip-
parcos catalogue and 91.7 pc by van Leeuwen (2007). In the
present work we retain a distance of 100 pc, meaning that
an angular distance projected on the sky of 1′′ corresponds
to 100 AU and is covered in ∼500 yr at a projected velocity
of 1 km s−1. The infrared environment has been recently ob-
served over ∼ 5′ using Herschel PACS by Mayer et al. (2011)
at 70 and 160 µm.
The main star, Mira A, is a long period variable that has
been on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) long enough
to display technetium in its spectrum (Little et al. 1987;
Kipper 1992). It is an M.7 type, oxygen-rich star with a
mass loss rate of the order of 10−7 M⊙ yr−1(Mauron & Caux
1992; Knapp et al. 1998; Ryde & Sch¨oier 2001). It has a
mass of 1.2 solar masses (Wyatt & Cahn 1983), a luminos-

ity of ∼9000 solar luminosities and a temperature of ∼3000
K (Woodruﬀ et al. 2004). Its apparent magnitude varies be-
tween as low as ∼2 and as high as ∼10 with a pulsation
period of 333 days (Templeton & Karovska 2009). It has a
very high velocity with respect to the local ISM, of the or-
der of 120 km s−1, oriented approximately from north to
south (van Leeuwen 2007). A bow shock is visible in front
of Mira A at a distance of ∼3′ from it (Martin et al. 2007).
It generates a cometary wake visible over ∼2◦ that has been
observed in the UV (Martin et al. 2007) and the interaction
of the circumstellar envelope with the interstellar medium
has been seen in HI (Matthews et al. 2008). Evidence for
the cometary astropause has also been obtained in the far
infrared (Ueta 2008).

The companion, Mira B, is probably a white dwarf with
a temperature of ∼104 K (Sokoloski & Bildsten 2010) at a
projected distance on the plane of the sky of 0.487′′±0.006′′
from Mira A and at a position angle of 8◦ south of east as
measured at 95 and 229 GHz on partially ionized gravita-
tionally bound gas (Ramstedt et al. 2014; Vlemmings et al.

Figure 1. Schematic summary of multiwavelength emission
in the Mira B environment. Data are from references 1
(Ramstedt et al. 2014; Vlemmings et al. 2015), 2 (Marengo et al.
2001), 3 and 4 (Karovska et al. 2005), 5 (Ireland et al. 2007), 6
(Matthews & Karovska 2006). Error bars are not shown but do
not qualitatively alter the picture. The blue arrow displays the
evolution of the observed CO(3-2) emission in the present analy-
sis: for Doppler velocities between 42 and 44 km s−1 it stays on
the nominal Mira B position and then extends south-east along
the arrow for Doppler velocities between 44 and 46 km s−1. The
orbit (full line) is that of Prieur et al. (2002), crosses show obser-
vations between 1923 and 1993.

2015; Planesas et al. 2016). The orbit is poorly constrained
by observations (Prieur et al. 2002): between 1923 and to-
day, Mira B has drifted by ∼0.6′′ projected on the plane
of the sky toward some 20◦ west of north (Fig. 1). The
orbital period is estimated to be at least 500 years. The
orbit is nearly circular and its projected eccentricity corre-
sponds to an angle of ∼22◦ with the line of sight. Lyα ﬂu-
oresced H2 emission has been observed by HST from Mira
B in UV spectra (Wood et al. 2002). Mira B is known to
accrete matter from Mira A, with a connection between the
two stars having been observed in near UV using the HST
(Karovska et al. 2005), in mid infrared using the Keck tele-
scope (Ireland et al. 2007), in soft X rays using Chandra
(Karovska et al. 2005) and in free-free emission at 8.5 GHz
using the VLA (Matthews & Karovska 2006). The Chandra
observation has revealed the occurrence of an X ray outburst
and of intense activity in the system, also conﬁrmed by the
detection of variable OH maser emission (Etoka et al. 2010).
A bipolar outﬂow with a wind velocity of 160±10 km s−1
has been revealed in the UV (Martin et al. 2007) and by
the presence of knots in Hα (Meaburn et al. 2009). It makes
an angle of 69◦±15◦ with the plane of the sky, the north-
ern jet being red-shifted and the southern jet blue-shifted
(Meaburn et al. 2009).

Mira’s

circumstellar

envelope has been observed
in CO(2-1) using the Plateau de Bure interferometer
(Planesas et al. 1990; Josselin et al. 2000) and in CO(1-0)
using the Berkely Illinois Maryland Association interferom-
eter (Fong et al. 2006). The former see a nearly spherical
envelope disturbed north and south by the bipolar outﬂow
while the latter suggest a kinematics combining rotation and
expansion. Both quote very low expansion velocities not ex-
ceeding ±5 km s−1.
Recently, the short distance environment of Mira A+B
has been observed using the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-

millimetre Array (ALMA). Continuum emission has been
observed at 1, 3 and 7 mm wavelength and its analysis
(Vlemmings et al. 2015; Planesas et al. 2016), in particu-
lar in association with JVLA observations (Matthews et al.
2015), has resolved Mira A photosphere with unprecedented
spatial resolution. The 12CO(3-2) line emission has been
mapped with, also an unprecedented spatial resolution of
∼0.5′′ up to a distance of ∼10′′ from the central star by
Ramstedt et al. (2014). The map reveals the presence of a
bubble in the south-east quadrant and of a complex pattern
of arcs. The authors suggest an interpretation in terms of
Mira A’s slow wind ﬁlling its Roche lobe and being accreted
by Mira B in the orbital plane (Mohamed & Podsiadlowski
2012). In the present work we analyse other ALMA obser-
vations that have recently been open to public access and
oﬀer a slightly better resolution at short distance from the
pair of stars.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

We
observations
(ADS/JAO.ALMA/2013.1.00047.S), made on the CO(3-2)
line between 12 and 15 June 2014 with conﬁgurations in-
cluding between 34 and 36 antennas and having a maximal
baseline of 650.5 km. The data have been reduced, merged
and corrected for the primary beam by the ALMA staﬀ to
clean maps using pixel sizes of 0.06′′×0.06′′ and having a
beam of angular dimensions of 0.325′′×0.309′′ FWHM at
position angle of 83.2◦. The total time on source was ∼10.6
minutes. The line Doppler velocity spectrum evaluated
from 25 km s−1 to 65 km s−1 is available in channels of 0.4
km s−1.

We deﬁne y and z as coordinates in the plane of the sky,
y pointing east and z pointing north. The projected angular
distance of pixel (y, z) from the origin is R = py2 + z2
and its position angle, measured clockwise from west, is
ϕ = arctan(z/y) + π. The x axis is parallel to the line of
sight with positive x values being red-shifted. The measured
ﬂux density is f (y, z, Vx) and its integral over the measured
Doppler velocity Vx, normally between 34 km s−1 and 56
km s−1, is F (y, z) = R f (y, z, Vx)dVx. We deﬁne an eﬀec-
tive density ρ = f (y, z, Vx)dVx/dx, that mixes information
concerning both gas density and temperature.

A study of the evolution of the distribution of the mea-
sured ﬂux density when moving away from the star reveals
a strong dependence on the velocity channel of the eﬀective
noise (meaning the peak observed at the lower ﬂux den-
sities). Indeed, as noted and explained by Ramstedt et al.
(2014) using a similar set of observations, the eﬀective noise
peaks at diﬀerent values and displays diﬀerent widths in dif-
ferent velocity channels, the channels with strong emission
having a limited dynamic range due to the lack of large
distance coverage. We therefore evaluate, for pixels distant
from the star by a projected angular distance 1′′<R<7′′ and
for each velocity channel separately a shift −∆f (Vx) and a
width σf (Vx) from a Gaussian ﬁt to the eﬀective noise peak.
The resulting distribution of [f (y, z, Vx) + ∆f (Vx)]/σf (Vx)
is shown in Fig. 2 (left). However, when looking at the same
quantity in the star region (R<1′′), we ﬁnd that we need to
increase σf (Vx) by ∼30% and ∆f (Vx) by ∼0.04 Jy arcsec−2
in order to obtain a good description of the eﬀective noise

structure observed in Fig. 5 are shown in Fig. 6. The blue
shifted region, 34 to 44 km s−1, and the red-shifted region,
50 to 56 km s−1, respectively identiﬁed by Ramstedt et al.
(2014) as dominated by a bubble and by spiral arcs, will
be treated separately from the central velocities, 44 to 50
km s−1, that correspond to sources conﬁned inside a circle
of ∼2.5′′ radius around Mira A. The three velocity inter-
vals just mentioned are not perfectly separated, which com-
plicates the analysis in the overlap regions. We shall aim
at giving as objective as possible a description of what has
been observed, without relying on a priori preconceptions,
such as the existence of spiral wakes or of an accretion disk
around Mira B. The complexity of the observed patterns
is such that one can easily be induced into grouping diﬀer-
ent features in associations that may have no real identity.
Moreover, the emission of the CO(3-2) line traces the pres-
ence of gas in only well-deﬁned conditions of temperature,
is strongly inﬂuenced by the presence of turbulences or of
short wavelength radiations and is sensitive to optical thick-
ness. In the very variable and inhomogeneous environment
of Mira, such factors may well play an important role.

4 THE BLUE-SHIFTED SOUTH-EASTERN

BUBBLE

Figure 7 (left) displays the sky map of F integrated between
Doppler velocities of 34 and 44 km s−1. Two ellipses have
been drawn by eye to roughly delineate the pattern identiﬁed
by Ramstedt et al. (2014) as a bubble. The position angle of
the major axis is 17◦ north of west, the aspect ratio (ratio
of major to minor axes) is 1.5, the half minor and major
axes measure 4.1′′ and 5.5′′ respectively and the coordinates
of the centre are y = 4.8′′ and z = −3.3′′. We deﬁne for
each point (y, z) in the plane of the sky an elliptic radial
coordinate η cancelling at the centre of the ellipse and taking
respective values of 0.85 and 1.15 on the two ellipses of Fig. 7:
ξ = (y − 4.8′′) cos(17◦) − (z + 3.3′′) sin(17◦)
ζ = (y − 4.8′′) sin(17◦) + (z + 3.3′′) cos(17◦)

(1)

η2 = ( ξ

7.2′′ )2 + ( ζ

4.8′′ )2

We also deﬁne an elliptical position angle ϕbubble, mea-
sured clockwise from east (rather than from west) such that
tan(ϕbubble+17◦) = (ζ/4.8′′)/(ξ/7.2′′). In order to keep away
from contributions from the Mira A+B neighbourhood we
require ϕbubble not to be in the interval [120◦,155◦].

Figure 7 (middle) displays the ﬂux per pixel and veloc-
ity bin averaged over ϕbubble as a function of η. The bubble
region sticks out very clearly. The FWHM is 0.17, meaning
∼1.0′′ on average. The inner edge is sharper than the outer
edge, while the opposite is expected from a bubble (under-
stood as an ellipsoid shell of constant thickness). The inner
region is strongly depleted, at the limit of sensitivity when
using a cut at 2σ’s (as done here). The ratio of the ﬂux inte-
grated over the inner part of the bubble (η <0.8) to the ﬂux
integrated over the periphery of the bubble (0.8< η <1.4) is
2.8% with a 2σ cut and 7.4% without cut. Figure 7 (right)
displays the Doppler velocity distribution for pixels having
η <0.8′′ and pixels having 0.8′′ < η <1.4′′ separately.

The dependence of the mean Doppler velocity <Vx> on
η and ϕbubble is illustrated in Fig. 8 and shows small, but
signiﬁcant variations. The mean Doppler velocity increases

1′′<R<7′′ (left) and, after having increased ∆f (Vx) by 0.04
Jy arcsec−2 and σf (Vx) by 30%, for R<1′′ (right). The Gaussians
have unit variance and are centred at the origin.

(Fig. 2 right). Typically, going from low to high emission,
σf (Vx) increases from less than 0.1 to ∼0.6 Jy arcsec−2 and
∆f (Vx) from zero to ∼0.15 Jy arcsec−2. We estimate that
both quantities are obtained with an uncertainty of the or-
der of 30% of their value. In what follows, ﬂux densities are
corrected accordingly and are retained only if they exceed a
speciﬁed number of σf (Vx), usually 2 (we speak of a cut at
2 σ’s). We have checked systematically that all results pre-
sented here are not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by a change in the
cut level, or even by the absence of cut.

The distribution of F as a function of R, averaged over
position angles and integrated between 34 km s−1 and 56
km s−1 is displayed in Fig. 3 (left) for cuts at 1, 2 and 3
σ’s. In what follows, we restrict accordingly the analysis to
pixels having R<7′′ in order to be free of problems related
with the lack of large distance coverage. In practice, most
of the results presented here are conﬁned to the interior of
a circle of radius R=3′′. Distributions of F as a function of
y and z are then shown in Fig. 3 (middle and right) for cuts
at 1, 2 and 3σ’s. They have been centred to have the peak
of maximum emission at the origin of coordinates.

3 MORPHOLOGY AND KINEMATICS OF
THE CIRCUMBINARY ENVELOPE: AN
OVERVIEW

Maps of the integrated ﬂux, F , and of the mean Doppler
velocity, <Vx>, are displayed in Fig. 4 for a cut at 2σ’s.
It is tempting to associate regions having similar Doppler
velocities and to group them to form simple patterns. An
example is a large south-eastern arc, labelled B in Fig. 4,
corresponding to what Ramstedt et al. (2014) call a bubble.
While the reality of such associations needs to be critically
assessed, one can state that a distinctive feature of the data
is the existence of regions separated by several arcseconds
but sharing very similar Doppler velocities. Fig. 5 displays
the Doppler velocity distribution in a circle of radius 7′′ cen-
tred on Mira A. It shows the contribution of several peaks
giving evidence for distinct families of sources, making it
easier to cope with the complexity of the observed patterns,
which Ramstedt et al. (2014) have rightly mentioned as be-
ing an essential feature of the Mira environment.

from ∼39 km s−1 inside the arc to between 41 and 42 km s−1
on the arc and beyond. In the arc region, it increases from
∼40 km s−1 at the north-eastern extremity to between 42
and 43 km s−1 at the south-western extremity. If the ellipse
is interpreted as the projection of a circular ring in space,
its angle with the plane of the sky is ∼50◦. Moreover, if the
ring is expanding radially at constant velocity, as suggested
by Fig. 8 (right), this constant velocity would project as
(42.5−40.0)/2∼1.3 km s−1 on the line of sight, namely would
be of the order of 1.7 km s−1 in space. To span 7.2′′, meaning
∼720 AU, at such velocity takes ∼2000 yr.

In summary, the blue-shifted part of the Doppler veloc-
ity distribution is dominated by a narrow arc (∼1′′ FWHM),
referred to as “the bubble”, that can be interpreted as the
projection of a circular ring expanding at a velocity of less
than 2 km s−1, born some 2000 years ago and making an
angle of ∼50◦ with the plane of the sky.

section.

The right panel displays the Doppler velocity distribu-

the contribution of what is described as the south-western
outﬂow in the next section. Two peaks, at ∼41.5 and ∼49.5
km s−1, stand out, suggesting a global expansion about a
mean velocity of ∼45.5 km s−1. The blue peak is easily iden-
tiﬁed as the contribution of the bubble, the red peak being
associated with the arcs displayed in the left panel. We have
considered various possible associations of these sources, ei-
ther on spiral arms or on large circles or ellipses. We do not

feel conﬁdent enough to give suﬃciently convincing argu-
ments about their physical reality and we prefer to refrain
from doing so. This should not be understood as a statement
against the existence of such associations, but we are sim-
ply unable to unravel them with suﬃcient conﬁdence from
the present data. The data used by Ramstedt et al. (2014),
having a better coverage at large distances are more suitable
for this purpose than those used here.

6 THE CLOSE ENVIRONMENT OF THE

MIRA A+B PAIR

6.1 Immediate environment

From the parameters of the Mira B orbit derived by
Prieur et al. (2002) we evaluate the space velocity of Mira
B in the Mira A rest frame to be ∼5.0 km s−1 and the
Doppler shift between the two stars to be ∼1.0 km s−1.
Fig. 10 shows Doppler velocity distributions in the imme-
diate environments of Mira A and B respectively.

Near Mira A, the spectrum is asymmetric, with the
blue tail larger than the red tail. This cannot be due to the
contribution of the bubble, which is quite small and indeed
clearly identiﬁed at ∼42 km s−1. The spectrum can be de-
scribed in terms of two Gaussian components: one, narrow
(FWHM=3.9 km s−1) centred at 47.2 km s−1 and a wider
one (FWHM=10.5 km s−1) centred at 45.7 km s−1. Integrat-
ing over velocity, the former is 40% larger than the latter.
If the broader component were caused by radial expansion,
it would mean an expansion velocity of ∼5 to 10 km s−1, at
the scale of the space velocity of Mira B in the Mira A rest
frame. The 1.5 km s−1 diﬀerence between Mira A and the
centre of expansion could then be interpreted as the result
of the centre of mass of the circumbinary envelope being
blue-shifted by such an amount with respect to the current
velocity of Mira A. If such were the case, Mira B would
therefore be blue-shifted with respect to Mira A and closer
to the Earth than Mira A.

Near Mira B (Fig. 10 middle) the spectrum displays
two peaks, one peaking at 47.9 km s−1 and the other at
44.6 km s−1. The relative amplitude of the two peaks is not
strongly dependent on the size of the circle over which the
ﬂux density is integrated around Mira B. This is also illus-
trated in Fig. 11, which displays position-velocity diagrams
conﬁned to the immediate environment of Mira A and B re-
spectively. In the present work, we call position-velocity (P-
V) diagram a distribution in a plane spanned by the Doppler
velocity and one of the sky coordinates, Cartesian or polar
or else, of the ﬂux density averaged over the other sky co-
ordinate. The emission centred on Mira B covers Doppler
velocities from ∼41 to ∼46 km s−1 (here, again, the contri-
bution from the bubble is small, even if relatively larger than
in the preceding Mira A case). Moreover, it is spatially re-
solved and extends over several tenths of an arcsecond (the
beam has a σ of ∼0.13′′).

The extension found by Vlemmings et al. (2015) in the
continuum is only 0.026′′ FWHM, signiﬁcantly smaller than
what is seen here. It is worth recalling on this occasion that
such dimensions are much larger than what is expected from
the accretion disk, which is far from being detectable. The
emission detected in the present study, is from molecular
carbon monoxide, implying temperatures at the 100 K scale,
and a low density of short wavelength radiations that dis-
sociate molecules. The emission detected in the continuum
by Vlemmings et al. (2015) at ∼95 and ∼229 GHz is from
partially ionized, gravitationally bound gas, namely much
closer to Mira B than in the present case (and still farther
away than the accretion disk).

The diﬀerence between the ﬂuxes integrated in circles of
0.3′′ radius around Mira B and its symmetric with respect to
Mira A (y=−0.5′′, z=0.07′′) is displayed in the right panel
of Fig. 10. If the peak at 44.5 km s−1 seen in the middle
panel were due exclusively to gas gravitationally bound to
Mira B, the diﬀerence spectrum would also peak at 44.5
km s−1 above a zero baseline and reveal the emission asso-
ciated with the bound gas. Instead, it peaks at 43.6 km s−1,

the right panel (44.4<Vx<46.4 km s−1 and −40◦<ϕB<40◦) corresponds to ﬂux densities mapped in the left panel of Fig. 14.

1 km s−1 lower, and becomes negative between ∼45.5 and
50 km s−1. This implies that rather than seeing gas gravi-
tationally bound to Mira B, we rather see an asymmetry of
the gas ﬂowing from Mira A, with an enhancement in the
direction of Mira B, namely eastward and toward the Earth.

A close look at the immediate environment of Mira A+B
between 41 and 46 km s−1 is given by the channel maps dis-
played in Fig. 12. Up to 44 km s−1, the emission is approxi-
mately centred on Mira B but for higher Doppler velocities
it evolves into a south-eastern arm that may be interpreted
as an outﬂow having its source at Mira A and ﬂowing to-
ward negative x values, being eventually focused by Mira B.
At the same time, two other outﬂows seem to originate from
Mira A, one aiming south-west and the other aiming some

20◦ east of north. They will be discussed in the following
sections.

Another illustration is given in Fig. 13, which displays
P-V diagrams over adjacent y strips, each two pixels wide
(0.12′′), z being used as space coordinate. In addition to
easily identiﬁable contributions from the bubble and from
red-shifted arcs, they show the south-eastern arm and the
north-eastern arm just mentioned. The north-eastern arm
covers Doppler velocities between ∼42.5 and ∼45.5 km s−1
in the north-eastern quadrant of the sky map, with both y
and z reaching to ∼1′′ from Mira A. On average, it is blue-
shifted by 3.5 km s−1 with respect to Mira A; if assigned to a
wind having an expansion velocity of ∼7 km s−1, this would
imply an angle of ∼60◦ with the line of sight.

labelled with the central velocity (km s−1). The colour scale is in the unit of Jy km s−1 arcsec−2. Black lines show the relative positions
of Mira A and Mira B.

In the southern hemisphere, the P-V diagrams hav-
ing y<0.5′′ are dominated by the south-western outﬂow;
however, from Mira B onward, one sees the south-eastern
arm starting to develop, covering Doppler velocities between
∼43.5 and ∼46.5 km s−1. At the same time, as y increases,
the contribution of the south-western outﬂow fades away.
The projected velocity on the plane of the sky of Mira B
with respect to Mira A is ∼3 km s−1. The mean Doppler ve-
locity of the south-eastern arm is ∼45 km s−1, blue-shifted
by 2.5 km s−1 with respect to Mira A; again, if assigned to a
wind having an expansion velocity of ∼7 km s−1, this would
imply an angle of ∼70◦ with the line of sight and a velocity
of ∼6 km s−1 in the plane of the sky. If the interpretation
of the south-eastern arm as an outﬂow having its source at
Mira A and being focused by Mira B is correct, the com-
bined movements of the expanding gas and of the orbiting
Mira B would generate a small southward curvature of the
south-eastern arm compatible with what is observed.

In summary, the observation between Doppler veloci-
ties of 42 and 44 km s−1 of an enhanced emission at the
precise location of Mira B (Fig. 12) gives evidence for the
white dwarf to play an important role in shaping the mor-
phology and kinematics of the gas ﬂow in its environment.
The evolution of the P-V diagrams displayed in Fig. 13 east
of Mira B provides another illustration adding to this evi-
dence. At ﬁrst sight, it would seem that we are observing a
mass of gas surrounding Mira B, with a size of a few tens of
AU, and having Doppler velocities with respect to Mira B

reaching 1.5 km s−1 in each of the red and blue directions. In
this case, the velocity dispersion would be the result of ro-
tation or/and accretion or/and thermal agitation. The P-V
diagram of Fig. 11 (right) could reveal a rotation only if its
axis were signiﬁcantly inclined with respect to the line of
sight and a bipolar ﬂow only if its axis were signiﬁcantly in-
clined with respect to the plane of the sky. It does not show
any clear sign of such eﬀects but better spatial and spectral
resolutions would be necessary to place sensible limits on the
corresponding velocities. Moreover, if we were observing gas
gravitationally bound to Mira B, one would need to assume
that the orbit of Prieur et al. (2002) predicts a Doppler shift
between Mira A and B three times smaller than what it re-
ally is.

It seems therefore more plausible to assume that we are
seeing gas ﬂowing from Mira A toward Mira B, being even-
tually focused or even partly trapped by Mira B, starting
from Mira A already blue-shifted, the velocity dispersion
being then the result of diﬀerent orientations and diﬀerent
intensities of the velocity vectors. The velocity distribution
displayed in the right panel of Fig. 10 gives strong support
to this interpretation. While it is sensible to assume that
the gas ejected from Mira A, and attracted and eventually
trapped by Mira B, will ultimately be accreted, none of this
can be seen from the present data (and is not expected to).
The evidence for the gas ﬂow to be enhanced in the neigh-
bourhood of Mira B does not exclude a possible small con-
tribution of gravitationally bound gas, but the present ob-

servations prevent to quantify it reliably. A hydrodynamic
model of the gravitational attraction and focalization pro-
duced by Mira B would help a better understanding of the
dynamics at play.

Finally, Fig. 14 provides additional information related
to the P-V diagrams of Fig. 11. The left panel maps the
ﬂux in the rectangle displayed in the right panel of Fig. 11,
at Doppler velocities intermediate between the Mira A and
Mira B maxima, showing that emission is dominated by Mira
A but slightly shifted toward Mira B. The middle panel dis-
plays the dependence on position angle measured with re-
spect to Mira A of the Doppler velocity averaged in a circle
centred on Mira A for distances between 0.1′′ and 0.6′′ and
45<Vx<50 km s−1. The sine wave ﬁt corresponds to a bipo-
lar outﬂow of ±0.15 km s−1 amplitude pointing north and
south, with a mean value of 47.4 km s−1. When retaining
only pixels closer to the star, the amplitude of the oscilla-
tion decreases but the mean velocity and the phase shift are
unaﬀected. The right panel displays the dependence on R
of the mean Doppler velocity <Vx> averaged over position
angle in the eastern hemisphere (toward Mira B) and the
western hemisphere separately. While starting together at
∼47 km s−1 they quickly depart from each other: the east-
ern part is ﬁrst blue-shifted with respect to the western part
but, beyond ∼1.5′′, the reverse applies.

MNRAS 000, 1–16 (2016)

6.2 An overview at larger distances

When looking on a larger scale (Fig. 15 left), in a radius
of 3′′ around Mira A and excluding the blue-shifted and
red-shifted ends of the Doppler velocity spectrum, emission
is enhanced along a direction pointing some 30◦ south of
west over a broad range of position angles. We refer to this
enhancement as the south-western outﬂow. Facing it, point-
ing to some 30◦ north of east (deﬁned as z’ axis), another
enhancement displays a strong central depression, reaching
up to ∼1.5′′ projected distance from Mira A. We refer to
it as the north-eastern outﬂow. When averaging over po-
sition angles, the integrated ﬂux decreases smoothly with
radius in the south-western outﬂow but is steeper at short
distances and strongly enhanced between 1.5′′ and 2′′ in the
north-eastern outﬂow (Fig. 15 middle). Similarly, the mean
Doppler velocity remains conﬁned between 47 and 48 km s−1
in the south-western outﬂow but is strongly blue-shifted at
short distances, around 1′′, and strongly red-shifted at large
distances, around 2′′ in the north-eastern outﬂow (Fig. 15
right). When averaging instead over R the position angle
distribution displays a south-west to north-east ratio in ex-
cess of 2 for 0.5′′<R<1.5′′, but is better equilibrated be-
tween south-west and north-east for 1.5′′<R<2.5′′ (Fig. 16
left). Similarly, the mean Doppler velocity displays a strong
north-east to south-west asymmetry for 0.5′′<R<1.5′′, de-
creasing abruptly from ∼48 km s−1 west to ∼46 km s−1 east,

but is better equilibrated between south-west and north-east
for 1.5′′<R<2.5′′ (Fig. 16 middle).

In order to reveal a possible rotation about the approx-
imate axis of symmetry z′, we display in Fig. 16 (right)
the distribution on the perpendicular axis, y′, of the mean
Doppler velocity averaged over −2′′<z′<2′′ or −1′′<z′<1′′
and 42<Vx<53.2 km s−1. In both z′ intervals we ﬁnd no
clear evidence for rotation. However, in the central region
(|y′|<1′′,|z′|<1′′) the data can accommodate a rotation of
∼ ±0.5 km s−1 arcsec−1.
Figure 17 displays a P-V diagram averaged over
0.5′′<R<2.5′′ using the position angle ϕ as space coordi-
nate. The western outﬂow covers from ∼60◦ north of west to
∼30◦ east of south, where its limbs are seen to share similar
Doppler velocities around 47 km s−1, and has an axis close
to the plane of the sky, pointing ∼30◦ south of west, where
Doppler velocities span from ∼43 to ∼52 km s−1, meaning
a radial expansion velocity of at least 5 km s−1. The eastern

outﬂow, displays an atypical pattern with two nearly sepa-
rated arms, one blue-shifted and pointing between east and
south-east, the other red-shifted covering the north-eastern
quadrant.

Sky maps associated with distinct regions of emission
identiﬁed in the P-V diagram of Fig. 17 are displayed in
Fig. 18. Regions 1 and 2 cover the south-western outﬂow but
region 2 extends about twice as far from Mira A than region
1 does, emission being enhanced at larger distances from
the star. While region 4 faces region 1 and displays a similar
morphology, regions 5 and 7 face region 2 but populate only
large distances from the star, in excess of ∼1.5′′, at variance
with region 2. The Doppler velocity distribution in the part
of region 2 having R>1.3′′ is precisely the same as in the
part having R<1.3′′. Region 4 corresponds to the south-
eastern arm and region 6 to the north-eastern arm that were
identiﬁed in Fig. 12, the former ﬂowing across Mira B and

sentation of the detected emission assuming radial expansion
of the circumbinary envelope at constant velocity Vrad. In
such a case, at any point (x, y, z) the relation Vx/Vrad =
x/√x2 + R2 applies, meaning x = R Vx/pV 2
x . Writ-
ing ξ = px2 + y2 one can then image the eﬀective den-
sity in any (z, ξ) plane making an angle ω with the y axis
by multiplying the measured ﬂux density by dVx/dx =
VradR2(x2 + R2)−3/2 and dx dy/(dξ dω) = ξ. In Fig. 20,
Vrad=7 km s−1, all Doppler velocities being measured with
respect to a mean velocity V0=47.6 km s−1. Other reasonable
choices of Vrad and V0 have been tried and the results have
been found not to diﬀer strongly from those presented here.
Contributions from the bubble and from the red-shifted arcs
are minimized by requiring 43<Vx<52 km s−1.

While Fig. 20 gives a perfectly legitimate model of the
observations, it must be clear that it may have nothing to do
with reality. Indeed, such a model can be constructed for any
data cube, whether expanding or not radially, a result of the
under-determination of the problem. However, it provides a
useful visualisation of the morphology, in particular of its
topology, as long as it is interpreted with care. In particular,
it is clear that it is of little value when Vx is close to V0: in
such a case, there is essentially no Doppler shift to deal with,
and therefore no hope to obtain a meaningful evaluation of
x from the Doppler velocity.

The north-eastern and south-eastern arms are clearly
identiﬁed in the ﬁfth and sixth panels of Fig. 20 respectively.
The south-western and north-eastern outﬂows cover panels
(−60◦<ω<60◦) and panels (120◦<ω<240◦) respectively. De-
tached shells are seen not only east, as expected, but also
west, in the ﬁrst panel. Detailed studies of the north-eastern
and south-western outﬂows are presented in the next sub-
section.

In summary, the sky map of the circumbinary envelope
at distances up to 2.5′′ from Mira A displays some symme-
try about an axis pointing ∼30◦ south of west but a signif-
icant dissymmetry between the associated hemispheres at
distances not exceeding 1.5′′: the south-western hemisphere
is dominated by a broad conical outﬂow, referred to as the

A for distances to Mira A between 0.5′′ and 2.5′′. The ellipses
delineate area associated with the sky maps displayed in Fig. 18.

the latter connecting to Mira A at Doppler velocities of the
order of 44 km s−1.

It is not clear whether region 3 has an identity of its own
or is simply the southern limb of the south-western outﬂow.
To answer this question we show in Fig. 19 maps of the
relevant region for blue-shifted and red-shifted Doppler ve-
locities separately. The southern limb is seen to point south
and to signiﬁcantly overﬂow in the eastern hemisphere, mak-
ing the case for treating region 3 separately from region 2
very weak.

P-V diagrams have the advantage of oﬀering a visual
representation of the information contained in the Doppler
velocity and therefore helping with the conception of a 3-D
representation of the morphology. Another approach in the
same spirit is illustrated in Fig. 20, displaying a 3-D repre-

south-western outﬂow, while the north-eastern hemisphere
is dominated by two arms, the south-eastern arm clearly
related to Mira B, and the north-eastern arm. At larger dis-
tances, the two hemispheres are more similar. In particular,
in both hemispheres cavities are visible, with a clearly de-
tached shell in the north-eastern hemisphere. It looks as if at
short distances a large gas volume, red-shifted and covering
the north-eastern quadrant, had been swept away or pre-
vented to emit in CO(3-2) because of temperature or turbu-
lences or else. Obviously, in both hemispheres, winds cannot
be assumed to be stationary and the observed morphology
bears the marks of history. While the kinematics show clear
signs of radial expansion, with typical velocities between 5
and 10 km s−1, no sign of signiﬁcant rotation has been de-
tected at the level of 0.5 km s−1 arcsec−1 or more. Finally,
the eﬀective density is concentrated in the vicinity of the
plane of the sky rather than displaying rotational invariance
about the approximate axis of symmetry observed on the
sky map.

6.3 South-western and north-eastern outﬂows

Figure 21 shows maps of the eﬀective density in z vs ξ planes
scanning across the south-western and north-eastern out-
ﬂows in 10◦ steps in ω from −45◦ to 45◦ and 135◦ to 225◦

respectively. The south-western outﬂow and north-eastern
arm are particularly important at ω = −20◦ and 160◦ re-
spectively, namely back-to-back in ω. However, they both
point south by some 30◦ and are not back-to-back in space,
the north-eastern arm being the main outﬂow component
in the northern hemisphere (one can just see part of it at
ω = 140◦ and 150◦).

In both maps, the emission is seen to be enhanced at
large distances. This is spectacular in the eastern outﬂow
where an arc covering close to a steradian contributes to all
panels above ω=170◦. Its contribution to the middle panel
of Fig. 15, its clear separation from the bulk of the outﬂow
and its narrow width, less than 100 AU, are reminiscent of
what is observed in detached shells around some carbon stars
(Maercker et al. 2014; Olofsson et al. 2010; Mattsson et al.
2007; Sch¨oier et al. 2005). Such detached shells are usually
observed on the dust rather than on the gas but there is ev-
idence for dust and gas having similar morphologies in these
cases. Also, they cover much larger solid angles, up to 4π,
and are not seen in oxygen-rich M stars. The present data
do not allow, without confronting them to the predictions of
hydrodynamic models, to make deﬁnitive statements about
the physical nature of these arcs, in particular to evaluate
the respective contributions of gas density and temperature
to the depression separating the arcs from the bulk. Yet, one

can safely state that some violent event must have occurred
some centuries ago, similar to the ejections of matter asso-
ciated with thermal pulses and/or helium ﬂashes in the case
of carbon stars. In this context, the presence of a similar arc
in the south-western outﬂow at ω=0◦ and possibly 10◦, and
of a small cavity at ω = −10◦, suggest a common origin for
all these arcs, all distant from Mira A by some 2′′, meaning
150 years or so at 7 km s−1.

An interesting feature, a small apparent cavity, is seen
in the north-eastern outﬂow at ω = 160◦, possibly related
to Mira B which sits in the middle of the outﬂow for Vx=45
km s−1. It is also seen in Fig. 12 between 45 and 46 km s−1.

7 DISCUSSION

At distances from Mira A not exceeding 2.5′′, emission is
dominated by two outﬂows aiming respectively at ∼30◦
north of east and ∼30◦ south of west, along an axis with
respect to which the sky map is approximately symmetric.
However, the eﬀective density is not rotation-invariant with
respect to this axis, being rather concentrated near the plane
of the sky, nor is it symmetric with respect to the equator as-
sociated with this axis, deﬁning a north-eastern and a south-
western hemispheres. Moreover, we detected no rotation ve-
locity about this axis at a level of 0.5 km s−1 arcsec−1 or
more. We have tentatively identiﬁed diﬀerent sources, which
are listed in Table 1, together with the associated CO(3-2)
ﬂux, each region being deﬁned by approximate intervals ∆R,
∆ϕ and ∆Vx respectively.

At distances from Mira A not exceeding ∼1.5′′, the
south-western emission consists of a slightly red-shifted out-
ﬂow covering a broad solid angle at the scale of a stera-
dian and expanding radially at a velocity between 5 and
10 km s−1. The north-eastern emission consists instead of
two slightly blue-shifted arms separated by a dark re-
gion covering the north-eastern quadrant and identiﬁed by
Ramstedt et al. (2014) as a wake of Mira B. However, as
Mira B is currently moving nearly north, we do not see how
this dark region could be associated with its wake. Beyond
∼1.5′′ and up to ∼2.5′′ projected distance from Mira A,
evidence has been presented for detached arcs that are rem-
iniscent of the detached shells observed in some carbon stars
and associated with thermal pulses and/or helium ﬂashes.
This is particularly spectacular in the north-eastern hemi-
sphere, where a detached arc covers the whole quadrant,
but seems also to apply, although less clearly, in the south-
western hemisphere.

It is remarkable that the above description ignores the
presence of Mira B. It is only when looking at the south-
eastern arm in the immediate environment of the A+B pair
that evidence has been found for enhanced emission from a
blue-shifted gas ﬂow having its source at Mira A and con-
centrated in the direction of Mira B, with a possible small
contribution of gas gravitationally bound to Mira B as de-
tected at much shorter distances by Vlemmings et al. (2015)
from the continuum emission of partially ionized gas. In this
range of distances, the interpretation of what is going on is
complicated by the wobbling of Mira A and B about their
centre of mass, both in position and in Doppler shift.

Numerical simulations by Mohamed & Podsiadlowski
(2012), using what they call the wind-Roche lobe overﬂow

(WRLOF) model, have shown that a likely mechanism of
accretion in the Mira A+B case was that the slow Mira
A wind would leak though the Lagrange point to Mira B,
thereby implying that a large fraction of it would be chan-
nelled to Mira B and eventually be accreted onto it. This
is at variance with models in which the wind escaping Mira
A is isotropic, giving a chance of being trapped by Mira B
to only a very small fraction of it. What is observed here
favours clearly the former hypothesis over the latter but
gives also evidence for two additional outﬂows escaping Mira
A in directions far away from the Lagrange point: the north-
eastern arm and the abundant south-western outﬂow, which
are of course absent from the simple version of the WRLOF
model. Assuming that the WRLOF mechanism applies, at
least qualitatively, to the south-eastern arm, one would then
expect a signiﬁcant fraction of its ﬂux to be accreted by Mira
B and the downstream gas ﬂux to be smaller than the up-
stream one. It is not clear whether the depression seen in
the ω = 160◦ panel of Fig. 21 downstream of Mira B can
reliably be taken as evidence for such an eﬀect.

The precise role played by Mira B in shaping the cir-
cumbinary envelope raises some unanswered questions. The
elongation along an approximate symmetry axis pointing
30◦ south of west observed in the present data is similar to
that observed at 94 GHz by Vlemmings et al. (2015) who
ﬁnd a major axis of 0.042′′, an aspect ratio of ∼1.2 and a
position angle 36◦ south of west. However, the continuum
was observed four months later than the CO line and earlier
observations of the star atmosphere suggest that the posi-
tion angle of the elongation is very strongly dependent on
the phase of the Mira A pulsation (Karovska et al. 1991;
Haniﬀ et al. 1992; Wilson et al. 1992; Quirrenbach et al.
1992). If this were true, the similarity between the elon-
gations observed by ALMA in the continuum and on the
line would be pure coincidence. One might nevertheless still
suppose that the elongation observed in the present CO
data is caused by anisotropic pulsation amplitudes, which
would then be responsible for shaping the outﬂow, caus-
ing the south-west to north-east enhancement observed here
and producing the south-western outﬂow. In this process,
dominated by the pulsation of Mira A atmosphere and its
asymmetry, Mira B would play no obvious role. In the north-
eastern hemisphere, however, additional mechanisms need to
be invoked to explain the separation in two distinct arms.
While focusing by Mira B must play a role in shaping the
south-eastern arm, it is diﬃcult to imagine how it could gen-
erate the broad dark region referred to as the dark eastern
sector in Table 1. This sector suggests a deﬁcit of some 4
Jy km s−1 of north-eastern emission with respect to south-
western emission: how could this be related to Mira B? It
seems rather related to whatever violent event produced the
eastern detached arc. Of course, the emission deﬁcit may be
due to conditions of temperature preventing the population
of the J=3 level of the CO molecule, the mass deﬁcit associ-
ated with the dark eastern sector being then much smaller or
even inexistent. Both the accretion disk of the white dwarf
and the occurrence of thermal pulses are known to release
important amounts of energy, but their relative importance
in shaping the circumbinary envelope is not clear to us. To
answer such questions, the present observations are but one
of the factors to be taken into account, the whole multiwave-
length spectrum having to be taken into consideration. In

and density.

8 SUMMARY

We have presented a description of the morphology and
kinematics of the gas envelope of Mira Ceti using high spa-
tial resolution observations of 12CO(3-2) emission made by
ALMA. We have tried to keep away as much as possible
from preconceptions that might have biased the analysis.
Yet, much is known of this source from multiwavelength ob-
servations, and this knowledge must be taken into account
when trying to make sense of what has been observed. A
distinctive feature of the observations analysed here is the
strong imprint of the mass loss history on the morphology
of the circumbinary envelope. Evidence has been presented
for the distinct contributions of remnants of events that oc-
curred a few thousand years ago and events that occurred a
few hundred years ago. The former include a south-eastern
blue-shifted bubble that can be described as a circular ring
expanding radially at a velocity of less than 2 km s−1 and
making an angle of ∼50◦ with the plane of the sky, together
with a number of red-shifted arcs. The present data do not
allow for a reliable association of these arcs in spirals, as pro-
posed by Ramstedt et al. (2014) using ALMA observations
having better large distance coverage.

The central region is dominated by the circumbinary
envelope, displaying two outﬂows in the north-eastern and
south-western hemispheres. At short distances from the star,
up to ∼1.5′′, they display very diﬀerent morphologies. The
south-western outﬂow covers a broad solid angle, expands
radially at a rate between 5 and 10 km s−1 and is slightly
red shifted. The north-eastern outﬂow consists of two arms,
with a separation of ∼90◦ on the plane of the sky, both
blue-shifted, bracketing a broad dark region where emission
is suppressed. At larger distances from the star, between
∼1.5′′ and ∼2.5′′ the dissymmetry between the two hemi-
spheres is signiﬁcantly smaller and both hemispheres display
evidence for detached arcs, particularly spectacular in the
north-eastern hemisphere. Close to the stars, we are observ-
ing a mass of gas surrounding Mira B, with a size of a few
tens of AU, and having Doppler velocities with respect to
Mira B reaching 1.5 km s−1 in each of the red and blue direc-
tions, which we interpret as gas ﬂowing from Mira A toward
Mira B, being eventually focused or even trapped by Mira

B, with a possible small contribution of gas gravitationally
bound to Mira B.

Throughout the present article, emphasis has been
placed on giving as simple and yet as reliable a picture of
what has been observed, with the aim of helping with the
conception of models that would allow for a deeper under-
standing of the physics at play, but the conception of such
models is clearly beyond the scope of the present work.
