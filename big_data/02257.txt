Abstract

It is shown that, when there is a magnetic ﬁeld present, in the framework of classical or
quantum mechanics, the active translations diﬀer from the passive ones and that the canoni-
cal momentum is not the generator of them. It is also shown that an inﬁnitesimal generator
of passive translations or rotations exists only if the magnetic ﬁeld is invariant under these
transformations.

Introduction

A recurrent topic in the textbooks on quantum mechanics is the representation of translations and
rotations. Owing to its special features and many applications, the group of rotations receives
particular attention, treating the group of translations in passing, many times as an introductory
example of group representations.

In the textbooks on quantum mechanics it is customary to deﬁne the operator that represents a

translation through a by

T (a) = exp(cid:18)−

i


a · p(cid:19) ,

(1)

where p is the linear momentum operator (see, e.g., Refs. [1, 2, 3]). Furthermore, the commutativity
of the spatial translations is employed to conclude that the Cartesian components of p must commute
with each other. However, when there is a magnetic ﬁeld present, the canonical momentum is a
gauge-dependent quantity, so that, for each choice of the gauge, one obtains a diﬀerent operator (1).
In fact, for a particle of mass m and electric charge e, the canonical momentum, p, is related to the
so-called kinematical momentum

(2)

(3)

(which is gauge-independent) by

p = π +

e
c

A,

π ≡ m

dr
dt

where A is a vector potential for the magnetic ﬁeld present, B = ∇ × A.

As we shall show, in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, one has to distinguish between active
and passive translations, and none of the inﬁnitely many canonical momenta is the inﬁnitesimal
generator of them. In spite of its geometrical nature, in previous works the choice of the generator
of translations has been based on algebraic arguments (see, e.g., Refs. [4, 5, 6]).

Throughout this paper we make use of Cartesian coordinates and Cartesian components of vectors

only.

2 Translations in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld in the framework

of classical mechanics

It will be very instructive to begin by studying the translations when there is a magnetic ﬁeld present
in the context of classical mechanics, using the Hamiltonian formalism. As pointed out above, the
canonical momentum is gauge-dependent. Under a gauge transformation, A 7→ A+∇ξ, where ξ is an
arbitrary diﬀerentiable function of the coordinates only, the Cartesian components of the canonical
momentum transform according to pi 7→ pi + ∂(eξ/c)/∂xi [see Eq. (3)], but this corresponds to a
canonical transformation since, if we denote the Poisson bracket by { , },

{pi + ∂(eξ/c)/∂xi, pj + ∂(eξ/c)/∂xj} = {pi, ∂(eξ/c)/∂xj} + {∂(eξ/c)/∂xi, pj}

= −

∂ 2(eξ/c)
∂xi∂xj

+

∂ 2(eξ/c)
∂xj∂xi

= 0

and

{xi, pj + ∂(eξ/c)/∂xj} = {xi, pj} = δij .

Since the Poisson bracket is invariant under canonical transformations, it follows that the Poisson
bracket is gauge-invariant. In other words, the Poisson bracket of any two functions does not depend
on the choice of the vector potential, which enters in the deﬁnition of the canonical momenta.

Any diﬀerentiable function, G(xi, pi), generates a (possibly local) one-parameter group of canon-

ical transformations deﬁned by

dxi(s)

ds

=

∂G
∂pi

,

dpi(s)

ds

= −

∂G
∂xi

,

(4)

with the initial conditions xi(0) = xi, pi(0) = pi. Equivalently, we can write Eqs. (4) in the form

dxi(s)

ds

= {xi, G},

dpi(s)

ds

= {pi, G}.

(5)

Now, for translations along the xk-axis we must have

xi(s) = xi + s δik,

so that the parameter s measures the length of the displacement. According to the ﬁrst equation in
(4), this implies that the generator of such translations must be given by

Gk = pk + f (x1, x2, x3),

(6)

where f is some function of three variables. In order to ﬁnd the expression for f , it is necessary to
specify the eﬀect of the translations on the momentum of the particle.

2.1 Passive translations

In the case of passive translations (the particle is observed from two diﬀerent frames, one of which
is translated with respect to the other) we expect that the Cartesian components of the kinematical
momentum be invariant, i.e.,

(i = 1, 2, 3), which, by virtue of (3) and (6), amounts to {pi − (e/c)Ai, pk + f } = 0, that is,

{πi, Gk} = 0

−

e
c

∂Ai
∂xk

∂f
∂xi

= 0.

(7)

(8)

(Note that the presence of the vector potential in this equation implies that f is gauge-dependent;
but this is precisely what is to be expected, since the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (6) is
also gauge-dependent, and in this manner Gk turns out to be gauge-independent.) From Eq. (8) it
follows that

∂ 2f

∂xj∂xi

e
c

∂ 2Ai
∂xj ∂xk

= −

2

and, therefore, the equality of the mixed second partial derivatives of f amounts to the condition
∂Bi/∂xk = 0, for i = 1, 2, 3; that is, the magnetic ﬁeld must be invariant under the translations
along the xk-axis [7]. If this condition is not satisﬁed, then Eq. (8) has no solution, which means
that these passive translations are not canonical transformations (see also the discussion below).

In particular, for a uniform ﬁeld, Eq. (8) has solution for all values of k, and if we choose
2 B × r, then the solution of (8) is given by f = (e/2c) εklmBlxm, and the generating function

A = 1
of the passive translations along the xk-axis is

Gk = pk +

e
2c

εklmBlxm = πk +

e
c

εklmBlxm.

(9)

(Note that Gk and pk are not related by a gauge transformation.)

It is important to point out that, in spite of the fact that the translations must commute, the

Poisson brackets between the functions Gk are diﬀerent from zero, viz.,

{Gi, Gj} = {pi +

e
2c

εilmBlxm, pj +

e
2c

εjknBkxn} = −

e
c

εijlBl.

(10)

However, the fact that these brackets are constant implies that the transformations generated by
these functions (on the phase space) do commute.

If the particle only interacts with the magnetic ﬁeld, its Hamiltonian is given by

H =

1

2m (cid:16)p −

e
c

A(cid:17)2

=

1
2m

2

π

(11)

and from Eq. (7) we see that {Gk, H} = 0, i.e., Gk is conserved if the magnetic ﬁeld is invariant
under the translations along the xk-axis. (Note that, in a naive way, one would expect a relationship
between the translational symmetry of the mechanical system and the conservation of the linear
momentum; as we have shown, this symmetry is related with the conservation of the generators of
passive translations, which diﬀer from the canonical momenta. Cf. also Refs. [4, 5, 8].)

A ﬁnite passive translation along the xk-axis is given by

(i = 1, 2, 3) hence,

xi(s) = xi + s δik,

πi(s) = πi

pi(s) = pi +

e
c

[Ai(xj (s)) − Ai(xj )]

and, therefore, {xi(s), pj(s)} = δij, but

{pi(s), pj(s)} =

e
c

εijl[Bl(xm) − Bl(xm(s))],

which is equal to zero if and only if the Cartesian components of B do not depend on xk. Thus, a
passive translation is a canonical transformation if and only if the magnetic ﬁeld is invariant under
the translation.

2.2 Active translations

When a charged particle moves in a magnetic ﬁeld, there appears a magnetic force given by

dπi
dt

=

e
c

Bm.

That is, a change in the coordinates of the particle (with respect to a single frame of reference),
produces a change in its kinematical momentum,

dπi =

e
c

εilmBmdxl.

(12)

Then, by combining Eqs. (3), (5), (6), and (12), one ﬁnds that, without having to ﬁx the gauge,

f = −

e
c

Ak.

(Note that, by contrast with the case of the passive translations considered in the previous subsection,
in this instance there are no integrability conditions on the magnetic ﬁeld.) Therefore, substituting
into (6), one concludes that

e
c

Gk = pk −

Ak = πk

(13)

is the generating function of active translations along the xk-axis. As in the case of (9), the last
expression is gauge-independent. Also in this case, Gk and pk are not related by a gauge transfor-
mation.

Again, even though the spatial translations commute, the Poisson brackets between the compo-

nents πi are diﬀerent from zero,

{πi, πj } = {pi −

e
c

Ai, pj −

e
c

Aj } =

e
c

εijlBl.

(14)

Only if the ﬁeld is uniform these brackets are constant, and only in that case the transformations
on the phase space generated by the πi do commute.

To end this section, we point out that, for any choice of the vector potential, the Cartesian

components of the canonical momentum satisfy the relations

{pi, pk} = 0,

which, together with {xi, pk} = δik, means that under the translations generated by pk the three
components of p do not change. However, these translations do not seem interesting from the
geometrical point of view, since p is gauge-dependent.

3 Translations in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld in the framework

of quantum mechanics

Now we shall repeat the steps followed in the foregoing section, studying the translations in the
context of quantum mechanics, when there is a magnetic ﬁeld present.

3.1 Passive translations in quantum mechanics

Guided by the results of the preceding section, we shall say that the Hermitean operator Gk is the
generator of passive translations along the xk-axis if

for i = 1, 2, 3, with πi = pi − e

c Ai (see Eqs. (3) and (7)). Then, making use of the Jacobi identity

[xi, Gk] = iδik,

[πi, Gk] = 0,

(15)

[πi, [πj , Gk]] + [πj , [Gk, πi]] + [Gk, [πi, πj ]] = 0

and the fact that

[πi, πj] = i

e
c

εijlBl

(16)

(cf. Eq. (14)), we obtain [Gk, Bl] = 0, that is, ∂Bl/∂xk = 0, for l = 1, 2, 3, which means that the
existence of Gk implies that the magnetic ﬁeld must be invariant under the translations along the
xk-axis.

Thus, in the particular case of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, Eqs. (15) are integrable for k = 1, 2, 3,

and one can verify that their solution is given by the gauge-independent expression

Gk = πk +

e
c

εklmBlxm

(cf. Eq. (9)). The commutators between the operators Gk are multiples of the identity operator,

and therefore the passive translation operators

which is valid if [A, B] commutes with A and B, we obtain

The translation operators (18) have been employed in the study of electrons in a periodic potential
(see, e.g., Refs. [4, 5] and the references cited therein), without recognizing its geometrical meaning,
looking for operators that commute with the Hamiltonian. In fact, in Ref. [5] it is claimed that
in the presence of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, the Hamiltonian is not invariant under the translation
group. As we have shown, by virtue of the conditions [πi, Gk] = 0, the Hamiltonian is invariant
under the passive translation operators (18), which, owing to (19), form a ray representation of the
translation group. On the other hand, in Ref. [4] it is pointed out that the motion of a charged
particle in a magnetic ﬁeld produces a change in the kinematical momentum of the particle (see
Eq. (12)), without realizing that the translations considered there leave the kinematical momentum
invariant.

3.2 Active translations in quantum mechanics

As in the case of classical mechanics, the kinematical momentum, π, will be the inﬁnitesimal gener-
ator of active translations (and is deﬁned even if the ﬁeld is nonuniform). As a consequence of the
commutation relations (16), the active translation operators

Tπ(a) ≡ exp(cid:18)−

i


a · π(cid:19)

do not commute with each other

The kinematical momentum as a generator of translations was employed by Jackiw [6] in his
derivation of the Dirac quantization condition. Jackiw showed that in the ﬁeld of a magnetic
monopole, the translations generated by π satisfy the associative law (without extra phase factors)
if the charge of the monopole satisﬁes the Dirac quantization condition.

4 Passive rotations in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld

According to the discussion above, we can deﬁne the generator, Lk, of passive rotations about the
xk-axis by the conditions

in classical mechanics, and by

{xi, Lk} = εiklxl,

{πi, Lk} = εiklπl,

[xi, Lk] = iεiklxl,

[πi, Lk] = iεiklπl,

in quantum mechanics.

From the ﬁrst equation in (20) it follows that

Lk = εkij xipj + g(x1, x2, x3),

(20)

(21)

where g is a real-valued function of three variables. Substituting this expression into the second
equation in (20) we obtain the conditions

∂g
∂xi

=

e

c (cid:18)εiklAl − εklj xl

∂Ai

∂xj (cid:19) .

(22)

The equality of the mixed second partial derivatives of g imply that B must be invariant under the
rotations about the xk-axis. If the magnetic ﬁeld is not invariant under these rotations, then the
passive rotations about the xk-axis are not canonical transformations.

The expression inside the parenthesis in Eq. (22) is equal to zero if and only if the vector
potential A is invariant under the rotations about the xk-axis and, therefore, in those cases, we can

5

take g = 0. For example, a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B = Bk, parallel to the x3-axis, is invariant under
the rotations about the x3-axis and, choosing A = 1
2 B × r, the vector potential itself is invariant
under these rotations, so that g can be chosen equal to zero. Then,

L3 = x1p2 − x2p1 = x1π2 − x2π1 +

eB
2c

(x1

2 + x2

2),

(23)

but L1 and L2 do not exist. The last expression in (23) is gauge-independent.

Another axially symmetric magnetic ﬁeld is that produced by a magnetic dipole. The vector
potential for a point magnetic dipole at the origin, with dipole moment µ, can be chosen as A =
µ × r/r3, which is also invariant under the rotations about µ.

If the Hamiltonian is given by Eq. (11), then, by virtue of (20) or (21), Lk is a constant of motion

if the magnetic ﬁeld is invariant under rotations about the xk-axis.

5 Concluding remarks

As we have shown, in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics and in quantum mechanics,
the deﬁnition of a translation or of a rotation requires the speciﬁcation of its eﬀect on the kinematical
momentum.

Another important conclusion is that one cannot impose the commutativity of the operators

representing translations based on the fact that the translations in Euclidean space do commute.
