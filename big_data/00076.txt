LOGARITHMIC LAWS AND UNIQUE ERGODICITY

JON CHAIKA AND RODRIGO TREVI ˜NO

Abstract. We show that Masur’s logarithmic law of geodesics in the moduli space of
translation surfaces does not imply unique ergodicity of the translation ﬂow, but that a
similar law involving the ﬂat systole of a Teich¨uller geodesic does imply unique ergodicity.
It shows that the ﬂat geometry has a better control on ergodic properties of translation ﬂow
than hyperbolic geometry.

Let X be a Riemann surface of genus g > 1 and ω a holomorphic 1-form on X and
denote by Σ ⊂ X the set of zeros of ω. The pair (X, ω) deﬁnes a ﬂat surface since there
exists a maximal atlas, deﬁned by ω, where transition functions on X\Σ are of the form
ϕa,b : z (cid:55)→ z + ca,b, for some ca,b ∈ C. This in turn allows (X, ω) to have a ﬂat metric at
every point of X\Σ. We will always assume that we are working with ﬂat surfaces of area 1.
The set Σ consists of the singularities of (X, ω). Every point in the singularity set Σ is not
ﬂat: there are charts centered at these points whereon polar coordinates give them angles of
the form 2π(k + 1) for some k ∈ N.
A ﬂat surface (X, ω) is a foliated space: since ω is holomorphic, the distributions ker(cid:60)(ω)
and ker(cid:61)(ω) deﬁne two foliations, the vertical and horizontal foliations, respectively,
which are singular at the points of Σ. The unit-time parametrization of these foliations
deﬁnes the vertical and horizontal ﬂows, respectively, which preserve the canonical
Lebesgue measure µω coming from the ﬂat metric. We denote them, respectively, by ϕv
t
and ϕh
we denote by |Γ| =(cid:80)
A saddle connection γ is deﬁned to be a straight segment on (X, ω) whose endpoints
are contained in Σ. Let Γ = γ1 ∪ ··· ∪ γn be a union of saddle connections of (X, ω). Then
union of saddle connections Γ =(cid:83)
i |γi|, where |γ| denotes the length, measured with respect to the ﬂat
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

For any ﬂat surface (X, ω), there exists a (not necessarily unique) collection of saddle
connections Γ(ω) with the property that |Γ(ω)| is minimized among all other collection
of saddle connections Γ(cid:48) which represent a non-contractible closed-curve. Although the
collection Γ(ω) may not be unique, its length δ(ω) := |Γ(ω)| is uniquely deﬁned, and it is
called the systole of (X, ω).
Every ﬂat surface (X, ω) belongs to a moduli space of ﬂat surfaces of genus g, Mg, which
is the set of all classes conformally-equivalent ﬂat surfaces of genus g. The space Mg is a non-
compact, ﬁnite dimensional orbifold. It is stratiﬁed by diﬀerent possible singularity patterns
of Σ. In other words, it is stratiﬁed by the number of zeros of ω and the corresponding orders

of the zeros, and diﬀerent strata are denoted by Mg(¯k), where ¯k denotes the singularity
pattern associated to the stratum. We denote by M(1)
the set of all ﬂat surfaces of genus g
and unit area. The space M(1)
Kg(ε) = {(X, ω) ∈ M(1)
(1)

is exhausted by compact sets of the form
: X is a Riemann surface of genus g and δ(ω) ≥ ε}.

g

The group SL(2, R) parametrizes a group of deformations of the ﬂat structure of (X, ω).
More precisely, for any A ∈ SL(2, R), we obtain a new ﬂat surface A· (X, ω) = (A· X, A· ω)
from (X, ω) by post-composing the charts of (X, ω) with A. This operation induces a group
action of SL(2, R). The moduli space M(1)
is equipped with an absolutely continuous,
SL(2, R)-invariant, probability measure µg [Mas82, Vee86]. The diagonal subgroup gt =
diag(et, e−t) induces the a 1-parameter family of deformations called the Teichm¨uller ﬂow,
which also preserves the measure µg. Denote by rθ an element of the rotation subgroup
SO(2, R) and rθ(X, ω) = (X, ωθ). We denote by Γt(ω) := Γ(gtω) and δt(ω) := |Γt(ω)| =
|Γ(gtω)|.

One of the most basic questions about translation ﬂows are those concerning the ergodic
properties of the ﬂow. The ﬁrst general results were discovered by Masur which are usually
labeled as “Masur’s Criterion”.

Theorem (Masur’s Criterion [Mas82, Mas92]). If the Teichm¨uller orbit gt(X, ω) of (X, ω)
does not leave every compact set in moduli space, then the translation ﬂow is uniquely ergodic.

Masur’s results were in turn used in [KMS86] to show that the translation ﬂow for any
ﬂat surface is uniquely ergodic in almost every direction.1 Masur’s criterion relies on the rich
interplay between the deformation of a ﬂat surface using the Teichm¨uller deformation and
its orbit in the moduli space. Note that by (1), the condition of a surface being “far away”
in moduli space is directly linked to one of its geometric quantities, namely its systole. More
general and quantitative criteria for unique ergodicity have been developed [CE07, Tre14] in
the same spirit as Masur’s. In this paper we will focus on the following.

Theorem 1 ([Tre14]). If

(2)

then the vertical ﬂow on (X, ω) is uniquely ergodic.

In line with the spirit of Masur’s criterion, Theorem 1 says that if the (ﬂat) geometry of a
surface evolving under the Teichm¨uller deformation does not degenerate very quickly, then
the translation ﬂow is uniquely ergodic.

In another work, Masur proved [Mas93] that the behavior of a typical surface in moduli
space obeys a certain “logarithmic law” `a la Sullivan [Sul82]. To state it more precisely,
let dist(ω, gtω) be the distance in the moduli space between a surface carrying an Abelian
diﬀerential ω and the one carrying gtω, which is its orbit under the Teichm¨uller ﬂow.
Theorem (Logarithmic Law for Geodesics in Moduli Space [Mas93]). For any ﬂat surface
(X, ω), for almost every θ ∈ S1,

1A slightly more restricted criterion was proven in [Mas82]. This is what was used in [KMS86].

In doing this he showed:

Indeed, he proved the upper bound in Proposition 1.2 and the lower bound in Section2.
A result of Masur [Mas93, Proposition 1.1] shows that there exists a C > 0 which depends

only on the topology of the surface, such that

(5)

dist(ω, gtω) ≤ − log(δt(ω)) + C.

Whenever we say that a ﬂat surface (X, ω) satisﬁes Masur’s logarithmic law, we mean that

Given the criterion for unique ergodicity (2), Masur’s logarithmic laws (3) and (4), and the
bound (5) we may wonder whether there is any relationship between logarithmic laws and
unique ergodicity. The purpose of this paper is to give some answers to these questions.

To set up our ﬁrst result, we note that for φη(t) = t− 1

2 (log t)−( 1
1 φε(t)2 dt < ∞ for any ε > 0 while both satisfy

2 +η) we have that
2 for
any η. Thus, Theorem 1 does not by itself imply that Masur’s logarithmic law yields unique
ergodicity, and neither does a logarithmic law involving the quantity − log δt(ω). The ﬁrst
result in this paper is to show that a surface which satisﬁes a logarithmic law involving the
systole, that is, involving the quantity − log δt(ω) has a uniquely ergodic vertical ﬂow.
Main Theorem 1. The logarithmic law

implies unique ergodicity.

Indeed, we show that if a ﬂat surface (X, ω) satisﬁes the logarithmic law (7) then it satisﬁes
the non-integrability condition in (2) and thus that the vertical ﬂow is uniquely ergodic.
However, Masur’s logarithmic law (6) does not imply unique ergodicity. We summarize it in
the following result.

Main Theorem 2. Masur’s logarithmic law does not imply unique ergodicity: there exists
a ﬂat surface (X, ω) of genus 2 such that

(8)

t→∞

and the vertical ﬂow is not ergodic.

What explains the distinction between the main theorems in light of (5)? The short answer
is that given a theorem of Kerckhoﬀ (stated as Theorem 2 in §6), the distance in moduli
space is measured by the extremal length of homotopically non-trivial closed curves on a
surface, and not by the ﬂat length of these curves, which is the type of length considered for
the systole. More speciﬁcally, as a surface degenerates, that is, leaves compact sets of moduli
space, the ﬂat length becomes a worse reference for the extremal length, and thus for telling

3

distances in moduli space. As such, the ﬂat geometry controls unique ergodicity. To
prove the Main Theorem 2 we devise a construction (following [Kat73], [Sat75] and [Vee69])
to take advantage of this observation to construct a surface which does not diverge in moduli
space too quickly but has systoles which degenerate quickly enough to make (2) fail and even
to have a non-ergodic translation ﬂow. We do this in Sections 6 and 7.

Our approach to prove the Main Theorem 1, is to show that if a surface satisﬁes the
logarithm law (7) then there exists a Cg > 0 depending only on genus so that for a set of ti
of positive lower density we have that

This allows us to show that the criterion for unique ergodicity in [Tre14] (Theorem 1 above)
is satisﬁed. To prove (9) we assume that there exists an  > 0 and a long stretch of t so that

for these t. During this long stretch of t, many diﬀerent curves become the shortest curves
at diﬀerent times during this stretch. We use the technique of combining complexes due
to Kerckhoﬀ, Masur and Smillie [KMS86] to build subcomplexes of our surface from saddle
connections making up these simple closed curves. Our Proposition 1 shows that, in the
presence of (10), curves that become the shortest at later times have to cross the boundary
of earlier complexes which we had considered. This allows us to combine curves which become
the shortest to earlier complexes in order to build complexes with more saddle connections.
We eventually accumulate enough saddle connections to triangulate the surface. However,
our argument is eﬀective and in the presence of (10) we do this while all the systoles are
simultaneously short and so our complex has small area. This is a contradiction and allows
us to prove that (10) cannot be satisﬁed for too long stretches of time. Therefore in the
presences of Masur’s generic bound for some t in any long enough stretch we must satisfy
(9).

Remark 1. We should point out that although the logarithmic law (7) is suﬃcient for
unique ergodicity, it is not necessary; the Veech dichotomy for Veech surfaces provide coun-
terexamples. Indeed a residual set of directions on a Veech surface do not satisfy Masur’s
log law and are also uniquely ergodic.

Remark 2. Since the present work is concerned with questions of unique ergodicity, we
will be working under the assumption at all times that the vertical ﬂow, whose ergodicity
properties we are studying, is minimal, i.e., every orbit which is deﬁned for all time is dense
in the surface.

Question 1. Is there a ﬂat surface (X, ω) so that lim sup

log t < 1 and the vertical ﬂow
on ω is not uniquely ergodic? The example in Section 7 shows that there exists a ﬂat surface
(X, ω) so that lim sup

log t = 1 and the vertical ﬂow is not uniquely ergodic.

1. Complexes and interval exchange maps

Two saddle connections are disjoint if they overlap at most at their endpoints.

Deﬁnition 1. A complex of (X, ω) is a closed subset of the surface whose boundary is a
union of disjoint saddle connections. If a simply connected region is bounded by a triangle
made up of saddle connections in the complex, then the region is in the complex. If every
saddle connection of a complex K on a surface (X, ω) has length at most  then we say K
is an -complex.

Deﬁnition 2. The level of a complex is the number of saddle connections in the complex.

The next lemma proven in [CCM13] is the key technical tool of the paper. It allows us to
add a short saddle connection to an  complex to obtain and (cid:48) complex of one level higher
where (cid:48) is still small. This technique goes back to [KMS86].
Lemma 1. Let K be an  complex and γ (cid:54)⊂ K, i.e., γ is a saddle connection which intersects
the exterior of K. Then there exists a complex K(cid:48) = K ∪ {σ} formed by adding a disjoint
saddle connection σ satisfying |σ| ≤ 6.

Let (X, ω) be a ﬂat surface, we say a subcomplex K is an (A, h) -subcomplex if its area is

at most A and the boundary of its interior has horizontal component at least h.
Remark 3. There exists a constant M which depends only to the stratum to which a ﬂat
surface (X, ω) belongs, such that if C is a m-complex, then m ≤ M. The constant M is
given by the number of saddle connections needed to triangulate the surface (X, ω).

1.1. Interval Exchange Maps. Let (X, ω) be a ﬂat surface and consider the vertical ﬂow
: X → X. Let β be a closed, short, straight line transverse to the vertical ﬂow and
ϕv
deﬁne the map T : β → β by T (x) = ϕv
t
r(x)(x), where r(x) is the ﬁrst return time to β:
t (x) ∈ β}. The map T : β → β is an interval exchange map since it
r(x) = min{t > 0 : ϕv
induces a map of β with ﬁnitely many discontinuity points {δ1, . . . , δd+1} (we consider the
endpoints of β to be discontinuity points), where d only depends on the topology of (X, ω),
i.e., on g and Σ. Since the ﬂow is minimal (see Remark 2), the map T : β → β is well deﬁned
and it exchanges d intervals.

This deﬁnition can be extended to maps deﬁned on collections of transverse intervals to the
vertical ﬂow and, in particular, to collections of saddle connections Γ which are transverse
to the vertical ﬂow. That is, the map TΓ : Γ → Γ is deﬁned as x (cid:55)→ TΓ(x) = ϕv
rΓ(x)(x),
where rΓ(x) = min{t > 0 : ϕv
t (x) ∈ Γ}. We denote by I1, ..., Id be the subintervals of this
interval exchange map. There is an upper bound on d that depends only on the topology.
Let DΓ = {δ1, ..., δdΓ} be the discontinuities of TΓ (again, we consider endpoints of saddle
connections as discontinuities). These are preimages of Σ under the vertical ﬂow. That is,
for each δi, there exists a si = s(δi) > 0 so that ϕv
i=1 be
these times. For every interval Ij we denote by ∂−Ij ∈ DΓ its left endpoint and ∂+Ij ∈ DΓ
j ∈ HΓ the corresponding times for the
its right endpoint. As such, we denote by s±(Ij) = s±
left and right endpoints.

t (δi) → Σ as t → si. Let HΓ = {si}dΓ

The following convention related to maps deﬁned by union of saddle connections will be

crucial for the entirety of the paper.

5

Convention. Let C be a complex and Γ = ∂C. In this case, the only maps we will consider
will be the ﬁrst-return maps to saddle connections in ∂Γ which ﬂow into C. In other words,
when considering a union of saddle connections Γ which make up the boundary of a complex
C we will consider the induced, ﬁrst-return map T : Γ(cid:48) → Γ(cid:48), where Γ(cid:48) ⊂ Γ is the largest
collection of saddle connections in Γ which ﬂow into the interior of Γ. This means that if C
has empty interior, then no map is deﬁned and, if it does, then it is always true that Γ(cid:48) (cid:32) Γ.
s(γ)∩Σ = ∅
for all s ∈ (0, tγ], then we establish the convention that either s∂1γ ∈ HΓ or s∂2γ ∈ HΓ is
zero, i.e., one endpoint of γ contributes zero in HΓ.

Moreover, if tγ is the ﬁrst return time of γ ∈ Γ(cid:48) to Γ(cid:48), i.e. ϕv

tγ (γ)∩Γ (cid:54)= ∅, and ϕv

2. Long orbits imply short closed curves

Proposition 1. Let C be a (A, h) complex on a ﬂat surface (X, ω). The following dichotomy
holds:

Denote by Γ = ∂C the boundary of the complex C. For each interval of continuity Ik of
the map T : Γ(cid:48) → Γ(cid:48) we may consider the minimum of the infumum of return times of points
in Ik to Γ and the inﬁmum of times at which some point in Ik leaves C under the vertical
ﬂow. Let LΓ = {li}d
Deﬁnition 3. We say S ⊂ R+ is (M, C)-detached if

h that stays in the complex. Then there exists M so that HΓ∪ LΓ is (M, N c) detached

Lemma 2. Let C be an (A, h)-complex. Suppose there exists a vertical trajectory of length
N A
for some c > 0. Moreover, M N c can be chosen to be less than N A
h .
Proof. Let Γ = ∂C. By a straightforward area estimate we have that

(11)

min LΓ ≤ A

.

There is a number d, which depends only on the genus of ω such that PΓ := |LΓ| +|HΓ| ≤
2d. Consider the interval IΓ = [0, N A
h ] ⊂ R and we consider it partitioned into r ≤ PΓ ≤ 2d
intervals E1, . . . , Er by the numbers of LΓ and HΓ that are less than N A
h . Let Ei = [ai, bi]
and (cid:96)i = log(bi)− log(ai). Note that by (11) and the fact that the right endpoint of IΓ is N A
h
. This implies that LΓ ∪ HΓ is (M, N c)-detached with c = 1
we have that max (cid:96)i > log(N )
2d.
Moreover, by construction, M N c ≤ N A
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 4. If LΓ is (M, C) detached we say Ij is early if lj < M . Otherwise it is late.
We say a discontinuity δi is conﬂicted if one of Ii, Ii+1 is early and the other is late.

Lemma 3. If δi is conﬂicted then si < M .

6

Proof. Let Ia be the early interval and Ib be the late interval. They travel together until
they hit a discontinuity and since one is early and the other is late they have to separate
(cid:3)
before M . So si < M .

Lemma 4. If δi is conﬂicted then ϕs(δi)(δi) is an endpoint of a saddle connection with a
vertical component at most M and horizontal component at most A

M C .

Proof. Let Ia be the early interval and Ib be the late interval. By Lemma 3 si < M . Let
J be the maximal connected set of late intervals that Ib belongs to. So δi is one endpoint
of J and δk is the other. Note δk is also conﬂicted. Because δk is conﬂicted ϕv
s(δk) hits a
singularity for some s < M . Notice that because the ﬂow is injective it sweeps out an area
at most the subcomplex before ﬁrst return. Flowing from a horizontal segment of length s
for times t sweeps out an area of st. Since the ﬂow of a point on J stays in the complex
from 0 to M C, its horizontal component is at most A

Now we can either form a saddle connection between ϕs(δi)(δi) and ϕs(δk)(δk) satisfying the
lemma or there exists a discontinuity δp between δi and δk that hits a singularity before M
so that we can form a saddle connection between ϕs(δi)(δi) and ϕs(δp)(δp). In particular δp
could be the discontinuity in J closest to δi which hits a singularity in time at most M . (cid:3)
Lemma 5. If δi and δj are conﬂicted discontinuities with every interval between them late
then there is a chain of saddle connections connecting ϕs(δi)(δi) to ϕs(δj )(δj) which gives a
geodesic segment on the ﬂat surface so that the sum of there vertical components is at most
dM and the sum of their horizontal components is at most A

CM .

CM .

The proof uses the following well known fact (it follows from [Str84, Theorem 8.1]).

Proposition 2 (Strebel). A geodesic on a ﬂat surface has the following form. It is made
straight lines connecting singularities of the ﬂat surface. At each singularity the consecutive
line segments make an angle of at least π.

Proof of Lemma 5. We assume i < j and let J be the interval between them. As in Lemma
4, |J| ≤ A
M C . Consider D(cid:48) the discontinuities between δi and δj that are ﬂowed into before
max{si, sj} < M . If this is empty the proof of the Lemma 4 implies this lemma. Otherwise
let p1 be the discontinuity immediately to the right of δi. The proof of the Lemma 4 gives a
short saddle connection between the singularity δi will hit and the one p1 will hit. Let J1 be
the subinterval of J between δj and p1. Now either the ﬂow is continuous on J1 until both hit
singularities or there exists p2 a discontinuity closest to p1 that separates the segments before
they hit the two singularities. Now if the angle between the saddle connections connecting
δi to p1 and p1 to p2 is at least π then this is a geodesic segment (Proposition 2). Otherwise
there is a shorter geodesic connecting them. Indeed there is a straight line connecting δi
and p2: the horizontal component that the saddle connection from p1 to p2 is the length of a
horizontal line segment that travels continuously. The line from δi towards p2 hits a vertical
translate of this segment and then follows in the ﬂat region region it sweeps out until it hits
p2. Repeat this process. Inductively each saddle connection has vertical component at most
M . Their total horizontal component is |J| and there are at most d discontinuities.
(cid:3)

2.1. An equivalence relation on discontinuities and a graph to build closed curves.
Deﬁne a relation on DΓ by p ∼ q if T (p±) = T (q∓) and consider the equivalence relation ∼
it generates. Deﬁne a graph as follows. The vertices of the graphs are equivalence classes

7

of elements of DΓ at least one of whose elements are conﬂicted. The vertices [p], [q] are
connected by an edge if there exists δ ∈ [p] and δ(cid:48) ∈ [q] which are conﬂicted and have no
conﬂicted discontinuities between them. Note that if two vertices are connected by such an
edge, Lemma 5 says a certain type of a chain of saddle connections exists between ϕs(δ)(δ)
and ϕs(δ(cid:48))(δ(cid:48)). We allow for edges to connect a vertex to itself and for there to be multiple
edges between a pair of vertices.

Remark 4. Discontinuities of the IET arise as pre-images of cone points and our equivalence
identiﬁes discontinuities that come from the same cone point.

Lemma 6. Every vertex in our graph has valence at least 2.

Proof. Let δ be a conﬂicted discontinuity. One side is early and the other side is late. Follow
the identiﬁcations from the relation ∼ for the side that is early until it becomes late again.
Since the relation forms a closed cycle this has to happen. When it does we have another
conﬂicted discontinuity for T . It has to be diﬀerent because we must become late again at
least one step before repeating the already given identiﬁcation. So all vertices have valence
(cid:3)
at least 2.

Lemma 7. A ﬁnite graph so that each vertex has valence at least 2 contains a cycle.

Lemma 8. Consider the collection of saddle connections corresponding to a cycle in our
graph. They form a closed curve that is not homotopically trivial.

Because of our equivalence relation, these saddle connections meet at the same cone point
(Remark 4). It the angle between ξi−1 and ξi at pi is less than π then either k1
i or
i . Now if Re(ω) ≥ 0 as ξi−1 went towards pi we will also have Re(ω) > 0 as ξi goes
(cid:96)1
i−1 = (cid:96)2
away from pi. Similarly if Re(ω) < 0. The geodesic in the ﬁxed endpoint homotopy class of
ξi−1 ∪ ξi needs to preserve the total increase in Re(ω) from the start of ξi−1 to the end of ξi.
We iterate this, and end up with a geodesic segment made up of saddle connections that are
separated from each other by angle at least π. Each saddle connection in our geodesic has
the same change in Re(ω) as unions of saddle connection giving edges in our graph. Since
this is a closed geodesic and one of the segments has positive length, it is not homotopically
(cid:3)
trivial.2

i−1 = k2

Proof of Proposition 1. Suppose there exists a trajectory starting in C of length N A
h > A
which is contained in C. By Lemma 2 the set HΓ∪ LΓ is (M, N c)-detached for some M and c
and such that M N c < N A
h . Lemmas 3 - 7 imply the existence of a cycle, every edge of which
represents a geodesic isometric to a chain of saddle connections with horizontal component
at most A
M N c and vertical component at most dM (Lemma 5). So we have a path with total
holonomy at most (d A

3. Induction setup

Proposition 3. Let (X, ω) be a ﬂat surface so that there exists t0 and  ≥ 0 so that for all
t > t0 we have that δt(ω) > t− 1
c + 2C + 5 (where c is
the constant from Proposition 1), there exists a p such that if for any s > p we have
• a level m complex C of gsω built from saddle connections whose length on gsω is

2 + for all (cid:96) ∈ [s, s + log(s2ρ)]

then Γs+log(s2ρ)(ω) (cid:54)⊂ C.

This is trivial if C has no interior and so we assume for the remainder of this section that
C has interior. Since systoles are not homotopically trivial, we also assume that the interior
of the complex is not homotopically trivial.
Lemma 9. Let (X, ω) be a ﬂat surface so that there exists t0 and  ≥ 0 so that for all t > t0
we have that δt(ω) > t− 1
2−. Supposed there exists a C such that for s > t0 we have C, a level
m subcomplex of gsω built from saddle connections whose length on gsω is less than s− 1
2 +C.
Then the area of the subcomplex is at most m2s−1+2C.
(cid:3)
Proof. It is a polygon with total perimeter ms− 1
2 +C.
Lemma 10. Let (X, ω) be a ﬂat surface so that there exists t0 and  ≥ 0 so that for all
t > t0 we have that δt(ω) > t− 1
2−. Suppose there exists a C such that for s > t0 we have
C, a level m subcomplex of gsω built from saddle connections whose length on gsω is between
s− 1
2 +C and so that Cc is not homotopically trivial. Then on gs+log(ms(C+3))ω the
sum of the horizontal components of the saddle connections that make up the boundary ∂C
is at least s− 1
2−3.
Proof. By our assumptions the boundary curve has vertical holonomy at most ms− 1
2 +C.
The boundary contains a simple closed curve that is not homotopically trivial because by
assumption the complement of C is not homotopically trivial and by the remark after the
statement of the proposition we are assuming the interior of C is not homotopically trivial.
That is, a homotopy of the boundary to a point would also homotope all of the curves in
either the interior or the complement of the complex to that point. So by our assumption

3.1. r-shadowing. We will complete the proof of Proposition 3 by appealing to Proposition
1. To do this we ﬁrst need a lemma to relate a closed geodesic not leaving a subcomplex to
a vertical trajectory not leaving a subcomplex.
Deﬁnition 5. Let γ be a saddle connection and a ∈ γ. We say that the vertical trajectory of
a r-shadows γ is there exists a σ ∈ R such that for all τ ∈ Ir := [0, r] (if r > 0; τ ∈ Ir := [r, 0]
if r < 0) we have that ϕh

τ (a) ∈ γ and that the set

T (a, γ, r) :=

(cid:91)

τ (a)

is a ﬂat triangle. We call T (a, γ, r) a shadowing triangle.

v(Γ)

Lemma 11. Let Γ be a union of saddle connections that form a closed loop on a ﬂat surface
(X, ω) such that |gtΓ| = δt(ω) for some t > 0. Then there exists a D, depending only on the
stratum to which (X, ω) belongs, so that there is a point a ∈ Γ such that its vertical trajectory
D -shadows some γ ∈ Γ.
Proof. Let a1 := a and δ ∈ Γ be a singularity, i.e., δ ∈ ∂γ for some γ ∈ Γ. Let r1 be the
largest number so that a1 r1-shadows γ and σ1 is the number from Deﬁnition 5 associated
to a1 and γ. Starting with i = 1, either ai ∈ Σ or not. If it is not, then ai+1 is deﬁned as

ai+1 = lim
t→ri

σit ◦ ϕv
ϕh

t (ai),

i.e., ai+1 is obtained as a limit by shadowing the same saddle connection γ which was shad-
owed by ai. If ai ∈ Σ, since Γ is a closed loop, there is exactly one other edge γ(cid:48) ∈ Γ which
contains ai. In this case, we deﬁne ai+1 to be

ai+1 = lim
t→ri

σit ◦ ϕv
ϕh

t (ai),

where ri and σi are the appropriate quantities obtained from shadowing γ(cid:48). We proceed
recursively, given ai, σi and ri, to obtain ai+1, σi+1 and ri+1. Since Γ is a closed loop, after
ﬁnitely many iterations of this process we shadow every edge in Γ and return to δ = a1. Let
k be the number of these iterations.
We claim that k ≤ 4(d + 1) where d is the number of cone points of ω. First observe that
once we have deﬁned ad there exists a simple closed curve on the ﬂat surface made up of
saddle connections where the sum of the (unsigned) vertical and horizontal holonomies is at
most the sum of the vertical and horizontal holonomies of the saddle connections in γ from
δ to ad. This is because rd is deﬁned as the number, maximum in absolute value, where
there is no singularity between the vertical trajectory and the saddle connection γ which it
is shadowing. One can build a geodesic between the singularity which deﬁnes rd and ad so
that the region between it and γ is ﬂat. If this happens d times then the same singularity
must occur at least twice and we therefore have a simple closed curve. If k = 4d then one of
these closed curves has that both its horizontal and vertical holonomies at most half of that
of Γ. So Γ is never the systole contradicting our assumption.

from the points ai ∈ Γ. Then(cid:80) ξi = v(Γ) < |Γ|. Thus the largest is at least v(Γ)

Let ξ1, . . . , ξk be the lengths of diﬀerent segments of shadowing trajectories which emanate
4d . (cid:3)

k ≥ v(Γ)

We wish to prove Proposition 3 by invoking Proposition 1. To do this we need the

shadowing trajectory to be inside C. This requires some additional work.

Sublemma: Consider the ﬂat triangles formed in the deﬁnition of shadowing. Under the
assumptions of Lemma 11 and the procedure in its proof, any point in such a triangle is a
point in at most two such triangles.

Proof. Consider gtΓ in gtω. Consider a point that is in at least two such triangles. We follow
the shadowing procedure from Lemma 11. For any two consecutive triangles it is contained
in, one of these shadowing trajectories shadows the point ﬁrst. One can link this point back
to itself by a connected subset of Γ union two horizontal trajectories, giving an element of a
nontrivial homotopy class.

If the point is in at least three shadowing triangles, one of these has that the sums of
vertical and horizontal trajectories is less than half of the sum of vertical and horizontal
holonomies of Γ. Since the length of Γ is at least
times the sum of its vertical and
horizontal holonomies, there is closed geodesic that is shorter. This contradicts that Γ is a
(cid:3)
systole at time t.

Lemma 12. Let Γ be a union of saddle connections contained in C which is the systole of
gtω for some t > 0. Then there exists a D, depending only on the stratum to which (X, ω)
belongs, so that there is a point a ∈ Γ such that its vertical trajectory
D − 2v(∂C)-shadows
|Γ|
some γ ∈ Γ and stays in C while it shadows γ.
Proof. This is similar to the previous proof with one small variant. First, there are two ways
a shadowing trajectory can leave the complex. 1) It can cross a saddle connection in ∂C that
is not the geodesic it is shadowing or 2) it can be shadowing a saddle connection in ∂C ∩ Γ
and the shadowing trajectory immediately begins ﬂowing outside of the complex. If either
of these happens then on each horizontal line given by a shadowing trajectory while it is
outside the complex there is a point in ∂C. The sublemma establishes that each point in ∂C
can be in at most two shadowing triangles. So in a shadowing trajectory one can travel for
(cid:3)
at most 2v(∂C) outside of the complex and the lemma follows as in Lemma 11.

The next lemma bounds the vertical component of Γs+log(s2ρ) on gsω from below. This
allows us to combine Lemma 12 and Proposition 1 to prove Proposition 3. Some notation:
if Γ denotes a curve on ω, let g(cid:96)Γ denote the image of this curve under g(cid:96) on g(cid:96)ω.
Lemma 13. Let (X, ω) be a ﬂat surface and suppose there exists t0 and  ≥ 0 so that for all
t > t0 we have that δt(ω) > t− 1
2−. For any ρ > 0 there exists s0 so that if for some s > s0
we have that

• δ(cid:96)(ω) < (cid:96)− 1
• Γ is a curve on (X, ω) with the property that |gs+log(s2ρ)Γ| = δs+log(s2ρ)(ω)

2 + for all (cid:96) ∈ [s, s + log(s2ρ)] and

then the vertical component of gsΓ on (X, gsω) is at least s− 1
Proof. Observe that if ρ < 1 then (ρ− 2) < −, thus the assumption implies the conclusion
for s0 = t0. So we assume ρ ≥ 1. Choose s0 large enough so that
2−1.5 and elog(sρ)(s + log(sρ))− 1

3.2. Proof of Proposition 3. To prove Proposition 3 we will show that, given some large
ρ > 0, if Γs+log(s2ρ) is contained in C for all t ∈ (s, s + log(sρ)) then by Proposition 1 the
assumptions of Proposition 3 are violated.

Given C > 0, let ρ = 2+C

from now on that s > p.

Let C be our m-complex and Γ be a union of saddle connections such that Γ =

Before proving the proposition we need a preliminary result which will let us apply Propo-

sition 3. Given a ﬂat surface let ϕθ

t be the ﬂow in direction θ on it.

Proposition 5. Let (X, ω) be a ﬂat surface of genus g. There exists e > 0 so that if C is a
subset of the triangles in a triangulation of ω and the perimeter of C is at most e then there
exists a homotopically nontrival curve contained in Cc.

Lemma 14. Let (X, ω) be a ﬂat surface of genus g and area 1 that is triangulated. There
exists  > 0 so that if C be a subset of the triangles and the perimeter of C is at most  then
there exists p, L, T, θ1, θ2 so that

Indeed, by our perimeter condition the area of C is at most 2. For each θ the measure of p
so that the ﬂow in direction θ between 0 and T crosses the boundary of the complex is at
most T establishing the equation. Thus for every θ we have

So by Fubini’s theorem we have that there exists p ∈ Cc

Proof of Proposition 4. We prove this by contradiction. Setting Cm = 1, we deﬁne recur-
sively ρm = (2 + Cm)/c + 3Cm + 8 and Cm+1 = 2 + 2ρm to obtain {ρm, . . . , ρM} and
{Cm, . . . , CM}. Pick α > 0 such that αx ≥ 2 + 2((2 + x)/c + 3x + 8) for all x ≥ 1, where c is
the constant from Proposition 1, and set 0 so that 0 ≤ 1

constant from Remark 3 and M ≥ 2M0. We now pick some  ∈ (0, 0). This establishes the

6. Geometry and extremal length

We brieﬂy review some results about the geometry of moduli space and we follow the survey
[Mas09]. For a Riemann surface X, let Q be the set of homotopy classes of homotopically
nontrivial essential simple closed curves on X.
Deﬁnition 1. The extremal length of a class α ∈ Q on X is the quantity

6.1. Low genus. In section 7 we will consider a genus two example. We review some
background for ﬂat surfaces of low genus which we will use in §7. We will use the following
result of McMullen [McM07, Theorem 1.7].

Theorem. Let (X, ω) be a ﬂat surface of genus two. Then it can be written, in inﬁnitely
many ways, as a connected sum (X, ω) = (E1, ω1)#(E2, ω2) with (Ei, ωi) ∈ M1.

If (X, ω) is a genus 2 surface and γ is a curve so that (X, ω) is a connect sum of two tori
along γ we call γ a slit. The slit deﬁnes homotopically non-trivial curve of zero cohomology
class (it separates the surface). Let α1, β1, α2, α2 be homotopy classes of curves such that
(cid:104)α1, β1, α2, α2(cid:105) = H1(X, Z). Since π1(X) = (cid:104)α1, β1, α2, α2|[α1, β1][α2, β2](cid:105), where [a, b] is the
commutator of a and b, let σ = [α1, β1][α2, β2], that is, the non-trivial homotopy class which
separates the surface into two slitted tori, i.e., the class of the curve going around the slit.
We can choose the αi, βi such that they form a symplectic basis.
2 , we will denote by δs(ω) the length of the shortest homo-
topically nontrivial separating closed curve on (X, ω) and by δ(cid:54)s(ω) the length of the shortest
t (ω) = δs(gtω) and
homotopically nontrivial non-separating closed curve on (X, ω). Let δs
t (ω)}, where we always measure lengths with
t (ω) = δ(cid:54)s(gtω) and note that δt(ω) ∈ {δ
(cid:54)s
δ
respect to the ﬂat metric on gt(X, ω).

For any surface (X, ω) ∈ M(1)

(cid:54)s
t (ω) then ﬂat geodesic of length δt(ω) is a member of a cylinder
A foliated by trajectories parallel to this geodesic. The modulus of this cylinder, denoted
Mod(A), is h/δt(ω), where h is the height of the cylinder. Note that in this case, by area
considerations, we have that Mod(A) ≤ (δt(ω))−2.

Note that if δt(ω) = δ

(cid:54)s
t (ω), δs

In the case when δt(ω) = δs

t (ω), the geodesic with length δt(ω) is not contained in a
foliated cylinder, as this would otherwise mean that the geodesic was non-separating since
core curves of cylinders have non-trivial homology class. In this case, the geodesic is either
the boundary curve or the core curve of an annulus A, called an expanding annulus. We will
also need a bound for the conformal modulus of this annulus.

In order to use Kerckhoﬀ’s formula (20) we will bound the extremal length of curves by
the moduli of cylinders and annuli which contain them. The following can be gathered from
[CRS08, §5] or [Raf05, Lemma 3.6] and provides the crucial bounds for the extremal lengths
in terms of moduli of annuli and cylinders.

Theorem 3. Let (X, ω) be a ﬂat surface of unit area and denote by Xt the Riemann surface
on which gtω is holomorphic. There exist constants Ks, K(cid:54)s > 0 which depend only on the
topology of the surface such that

≤ max{−Ks log(δs

t (ω)) + Ks, K(cid:54)s · (δ

t )−2 + K(cid:54)s}.
(cid:54)s

This gives a bound for Kerckhoﬀ’s distance (20).

Corollary 1. Let (X, ω) ∈ M(1)
and denote by Xt the Riemann surface on which gtω is
holomorphic. Then there exists a constant K2 which depends only on the topology of the

In this section we construct the example which yields Main Theorem 2. Recall that if
α ∈ (0, 1)\ Q, it has a unique continued fraction expansion α = [a1, ...]. Its best convergents
are given by p0 = 0, p1 = 1 = q0 and inductively qk+1 = ak+1qk + qk−1 and pk+1 =
ak+1pk + pk−1. Let α ∈ [0, 1) have continued fraction expansion ai = (cid:100)(i + 10)(log(i))2(cid:101) for
all i. Let (cid:107)nα(cid:107) = d(nα, Z) and Rα(x) = x + α − (cid:98)x + α(cid:99) the rotation by α.

We ﬁrst wish to consider primitive vectors in this set. We may assume the vector starts
from (0, 0), has vertical component of its holonomy n for some n ∈ N. By our assumption
that our simple closed curve gets small under gt we further restrict our attention to when
such a saddle connection has that the horizontal component of its holonomy is less than 2c2
n .
There are two possibilities: the vector connects (0, 0) to (x, y) ∈ Λα or it connects (0, 0)
i=1 2(cid:107)qiα(cid:107), 0). We consider the ﬁrst option. Observe that the closest

b ≤ ak+1. So by the sublemma we have that any saddle connection that can be made short

It is obvious that
this curve is a closed curve on ˆω or twice it is a closed curve on ˆω.

Now if ξ is a saddle connection connecting (0, 0) to Λα + ((cid:80)∞

for all k we have
i=k+1 2(cid:107)qiα(cid:107). Observe that there is a saddle connection
j=1 2qj). Notice that it connects two diﬀerent cone points.
Consider the union of this saddle connection and its image under the involution +1 that
interchanges the two tori. The union of these two gives a simple closed geodesic that discon-
nects the surface. See for example [CMW14, Section 2.3]. Call this curve ζk.
i=1 2(cid:107)qiα(cid:107), 0) with vertical
holonomy between qk, qk+1 we have that for all t, gtξ > 1
9gtζk. To see this ﬁrst notice that
because the vertical holonomy of ζk < 9qk if the holonomy of gtξ ≤ 1
9gtζk then the horizontal
holonomy of ξ must be smaller than ζk’s.
It is straightforward to check that no saddle
connections we are considering (other than the two equal length saddle connections that
make up ζk) have this property.
