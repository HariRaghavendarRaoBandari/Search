ABSTRACT

Depending on the assumptions on the power corrections to the exclusive b → s(cid:96)+(cid:96)− decays,
the latest data of the LHCb collaboration - based on the 3 fb−1 data set and on two diﬀerent
experimental analysis methods - still shows some tensions with the SM predictions. We present
a detailed analysis of the theoretical inputs and various global ﬁts to all the available b → s(cid:96)+(cid:96)−
data. This constitutes the ﬁrst global analysis of the new data of the LHCb collaboration
based on the hypothesis that these tensions can be at least partially explained by new physics
contributions. In our model-independent analysis we present one-, two-, four-, and also ﬁve-
dimensional global ﬁts in the space of Wilson coeﬃcients to all available b → s(cid:96)+(cid:96)− data.
We also compare the two diﬀerent experimental LHCb analyses of the angular observables in
B → K∗µ+µ−. We explicitly analyse the dependence of our results on the assumptions about
power corrections, but also on the errors present in the form factor calculations. Moreover, based
on our new global ﬁts we present predictions for ratios of observables which may show a sign
of lepton non-universality. Their measurements would crosscheck the LHCb result on the ratio
RK = BR(B+ → K+µ+µ−)/BR(B+ → K+e+e−) in the low-q2 region which deviates from the
SM prediction by 2.6σ.

1 Introduction
The LHCb collaboration has recently presented the angular analysis of the B0 → K∗0µ+µ−
decay with the 3 fb−1 data set. They use two analysis methods. The observables are determined
using an unbinned maximum likelihood ﬁt and by the principal angular moments [1]. In addition,
a new analysis on the angular observables in Bs → φµ+µ− has been presented [2].
These new analyses of the LHCb collaboration have been eagerly awaited in view of the
previous LHCb analysis of the B0 → K∗0µ+µ− based on the 1 fb−1 data set [3]. The LHCb
collaboration had announced a local discrepancy of 3.7σ from the Standard Model (SM) predic-
tions in one bin for one of the angular observables [3]. There had been also more, yet smaller
tensions with the SM predictions in other observables. This announcement was followed by a
large number of theoretical analyses showing that, due to the large hadronic uncertainties in
exclusive modes, it is not clear at all whether this anomaly is a ﬁrst sign for new physics be-
yond the SM or a consequence of underestimated hadronic power corrections or just a statistical
ﬂuctuation [4–22].
In the recent analysis based on the 3 fb−1 data set the LHCb collaboration now announced
a 3.4σ tension with predictions based on the SM within a global ﬁt to the complete set of CP -
averaged observables [1]. They point out that this tension could be explained by contributions
from physics beyond the SM or by unexpectedly large hadronic eﬀects that are underestimated
in the SM predictions.
Regarding the latter option it is important to note that there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in
the theoretical accuracy of the inclusive and exclusive b → s(cid:96)+(cid:96)− decays in the low-q2 region. In
the inclusive case, there is a theoretical description of power corrections; they can be calculated
or at least estimated within the theoretical approach (for reviews see [23–25]). 1 In contrast,
in the exclusive case there is no theoretical description of power corrections existing within
the theoretical framework of QCD factorisation and SCET which is the standard theoretical
framework for these exclusive decay modes in the low-q2 region. Thus, power corrections can
only be guesstimated. This issue makes it rather diﬃcult or even impossible to separate new
physics eﬀects from such potentially large hadronic power corrections within these exclusive
angular observables. So these tensions might stay unexplained until Belle II will clarify the
situation by measuring the corresponding inclusive b → s(cid:96)(cid:96) observables as was demonstrated in
Ref. [16, 31, 32].

Thus, it is also obvious that the signiﬁcance of the tension depends in principle on the
precise guesstimate of the unknown power corrections within the SM prediction. Because the
two sets of SM predictions - LHCb compares with in their ﬁrst and in their latest analysis - use
rather diﬀerent guesstimates [13, 33] the quoted standard deviations in both analyses cannot be
compared directly. 2

This situation motivated a recent theory analysis in which the unknown power corrections
were just ﬁtted to the data [34] using an ansatz with 18 additional real parameters in the ﬁt.

b and 1/m3

1In the inclusive case one can show that if only the leading operator of the electroweak hamiltonian is considered,
one is led to a local operator product expansion (OPE). In this case, the leading hadronic power corrections in the
decay ¯B → Xs(cid:96)+(cid:96)− scale with 1/m2
b only and have already been analysed [26]. A systematic and careful
analysis of hadronic power corrections including all relevant operators has been performed in the case of the decay
¯B → Xsγ [27]. Such linear power corrections can be analysed within soft-collinear eﬀective theory (SCET). This
analysis goes beyond the local OPE. An additional uncertainty of ±5% has been identiﬁed. The analysis in the
case of ¯B → Xs(cid:96)+(cid:96)− is work in progress. There is no reason to expect any large deviation from the ¯B → Xsγ
result. Nonfactorisable power corrections that scale with 1/m2
c have ﬁrst been considered in Ref. [28], but can
be now included in the systematic analysis of hadronic power corrections and be calculated quite analogously to
those in the decay ¯B → Xsγ [27]. Moreover, in the KS approach [29, 30] one absorbs factorisable long-distance
charm rescattering eﬀects (in which the ¯B → Xsc¯c transition can be factorised into the product of ¯sb and c¯c
colour-singlet currents) into the matrix element of the leading semileptonic operator O9. Following the inclusion
of nonperturbative corrections scaling with 1/m2
2In this sense the signiﬁcance of the tension with the SM has not been really reduced within the new 3 fb−1
measurement compared to the one based on the 1 fb−1 data set.

c, the KS approach avoids double-counting.

2

However, this ﬁt to the data needs very large power corrections in the critical bins.
If one
compares the ﬁtted theory predictions in this analysis with the leading contributions based on
QCD factorisation then one ﬁnds 20% but also 50% or even larger power corrections relative to
the leading contribution. The existence of such large hadronic corrections cannot be ruled out
in principle. The authors of Ref. [34] come to the well-known conclusion that it is diﬃcult to
deduce the existence of new physics eﬀects unambiguously from the measurements of exclusive
b → s(cid:96)+(cid:96)− observables.
In this respect, another tension in the LHCb data of b → s(cid:96)+(cid:96)− gains importance. The ratio
RK = BR(B+ → K+µ+µ−)/ BR(B+ → K+e+e−) in the low-q2 region had been measured
by LHCb using the full 3 fb−1 of data, showing a 2.6σ deviation from the SM prediction [35].
This discrepancy has been addressed in many studies [32, 36–60]. It is often claimed that the
electromagnetic corrections might not have been fully taken into account in this measurement.
Thus one might wonder whether this sign of lepton non-universality could be traced back to
logarithmically enhanced QED corrections. These corrections were calculated in the inclusive
case in Ref. [61]. However, LHCb uses the PHOTOS Monte Carlo to eliminate the impact of
collinear photon emissions from the ﬁnal state electrons. Therefore, such corrections do not
seem to apply to the ratio RK, especially if one considers the agreement between the PHOTOS
results and the analytical calculations in the inclusive case in Ref. [61]. Nevertheless, it would
be an interesting check to correct for photon radiation using data-driven methods that do not
rely on PHOTOS.
In contrast to the anomaly in the rare decay B → K∗µ+µ− which is aﬀected by power
corrections, the ratio RK is theoretically rather clean and its tension with the SM cannot be
explained by power corrections. But independent of this diﬀerence, both tensions might be
healed by new physics in the semi-leptonic operator contribution C9. Therefore the measurement
of other ratios which could show lepton non-universality would be a very important crosscheck
of the present RK result but also of the anomalies in the angular observables in B → K∗µ+µ−.
Thus, we present predictions for such ratios based on the global ﬁts in this paper.

Finally, we mention that there is an alternative approach to calculate the nonlocal charm-
loop eﬀects. In Ref. [19] a local OPE near the light cone for the gluon emission from the c-quark
loop at q2 (cid:28) m2
c is used to derive a nonlocal eﬀective quark-antiquark gluon operator. Then
the LCSR approach leads to an eﬀective resummation of the soft-gluon part valid for q2 (cid:28) m2
c
only. But a prediction of the charm loops eﬀects up to the open charm threshold is achieved
by a phenomenological model of the charmonium resonances via a dispersion relation. Because
not all contributions were included in the dispersion relation this prediction for larger q2 should
not be regarded as the ﬁnal result. An analogous complete calculation of the soft-gluon non-
factorisable contributions in the case of the decay of B0 → K0(cid:96)+(cid:96)− [20] leads to a moderate
eﬀect. The corresponding predictions of the branching ratios for the various bins are given in
Appendix A next to our predictions based on QCD factorisation. The two sets of predictions
are compatible with each other at the 1σ level.

Based on QCD factorisation there are two strategies to calculate the decay amplitudes: the
so-called soft form factor (soft FF) approach (see [62, 63]) and the full form factor (full FF)
approach (see [64]). Both methods have been implemented in SuperIso v3.5 [65, 66] which
is used for all the calculations presented in this work. We discuss in detail the advantages
and the disadvantages of these two approaches and critically analyse the guesstimate of power
corrections which are used in the literature (Section 2). Among the input parameters and
experimental data used in our study, we mainly discuss the theoretical error estimation and the
form factor calculations via the light cone sum rule method and also deﬁne the statistical method
used for the ﬁtting analysis of the b → s data in Section 3. In contrast to many analyses in the
literature, we consider one- and two- but also four- and ﬁve-dimensional global ﬁts (in the space
of Wilson coeﬃcients) within our model-independent analysis of the present data. We analyse
the dependence of our results on the theoretical approach used, as well as the assumptions
about power corrections, and also on the errors present in the form factor calculations. We also

3

investigate the eﬀect of the S5 and the RK measurements on the global ﬁt results. Moreover,
we compare the Wilson coeﬃcient ﬁts when using the two diﬀerent experimental LHCb analysis
for B → K∗µ+µ− angular observables which this collaboration presented recently [1] (Section
4). Our results represent the ﬁrst global ﬁt analysis with the latest LHCb results for B →
K∗µ+µ− angular observables assuming that the tensions can be at least partially explained by
new physics contributions. Finally, we use our global ﬁt results to present predictions for other
ratios of observables which may indicate lepton non-universality. As mentioned above, these
measurements will be important crosschecks of the anomalies discussed in this paper (Section
5). We give our conclusions in Section 6 and additional analyses and more details on our
theoretical predictions in the appendices.

2 Soft vs. full form factor approach
The theoretical description of the B → K(∗)µ+µ− or Bs → φµ+µ− decays in the low-q2 region is
based on the QCD-improved factorisation (QCDf) approach and its ﬁeld-theoretical formulation
of Soft-Collinear Eﬀective Theory (SCET) [67, 68]. The combined limit of a heavy b quark and
an energetic meson M like K∗, K, or φ leads to the schematic form of the decay amplitude

T = Cξ + ΦB ⊗ T ⊗ ΦK(∗),φ + O(ΛQCD/mb),

(2.1)

which is valid to leading order in ΛQCD/mb and to all orders in αs. Thus the decay amplitude
factorises into process-independent non-perturbative quantities like B → M soft form factors
(ξ) and light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of the heavy and light mesons (Φ) and
perturbatively calculable quantities (C, T ). The key issue of this factorisation formula is that
there are non-factorisable contributions (second term) beyond the ones described by form factors
(ﬁrst term).

However, at order ΛQCD/mb the factorisation formula breaks down. This means that the
power corrections cannot be calculated within QCDf in general. As already emphasised in the
introduction, this is the main drawback of this approach which makes it diﬃcult to identify new
physics eﬀects. There are power corrections to both terms in the factorisation formulae, which
are called factorisable and non-factorisable power corrections respectively.
The large energy limit allows for simpliﬁcations [69]. The seven independent full QCD
B → K∗ form factors V, A0,1,2 and T1,2,3, for example, are reduced to two universal soft form
factors ξ⊥ and ξ(cid:107) in this limit. These relations can also be written via a factorisation formula
in a schematic way:

Ffull(q2) = Dξsoft + ΦB ⊗ TF ⊗ ΦM + O(ΛQCD/mb) ,

(2.2)

where D and TF are perturbatively calculable functions. There are non-factorisable contributions
(second term), but also power corrections (third term).

Based on QCDf there are two strategies to calculate the decay amplitudes: the so-called
soft form factor (soft FF) approach (see [62, 63]) and the full form factor (full FF) approach
(see [64]).

Using the former strategy, one takes advantage of the factorisation formula (2.1) and the
universal soft form factors. The various meson spin amplitudes at leading order in ΛQCD/mb
and αs turn out to be linear in the soft form factors ξ⊥,(cid:107) and also in the short-distance Wilson
coeﬃcients. As was explicitly shown in Refs. [63, 70], these simpliﬁcations allow to design a
set of optimised observables, in which any soft form factor dependence (and its corresponding
uncertainty) cancels out for all low dilepton mass squared q2 at leading order in αs and ΛQCD/mb.
An optimised set of independent observables was constructed in Refs. [33, 71], in which almost
all observables are free from hadronic uncertainties which are related to the form factors.

However, there are additional hadronic uncertainties in the factorisation formula (2.1),
namely the unknown factorisable and non-factorisable power corrections. They are not cal-

4

culable and can only be guesstimated through dimensional arguments within the QCDf/SCET
approach [63, 70].

As Eq. (2.2) indicates, the factorisable power corrections can be avoided by using the full
QCD form factors. Thus, within this full FF approach one faces only unknown power corrections
to the non-factorisable contributions; this means one has to guesstimate only power corrections
to leading contributions from 4-quark operators O1−6 and the chromomagnetic operator O8. 3
It is important to note that the operators O7, O9, and O10 do not induce non-factorisable con-
tributions. 4

As it was argued in Ref. [72], the correlations between QCD form factors in the large energy
limit of the meson can be established also in this full FF approach using the equation of motions.
We will discuss this issue further in Section 3.1.

In a global analysis both strategies should lead to similar results if all correlations are taken
into account. If one focuses on a single observable, the advantage of the optimised observables
on the theory side is unfortunately diminished by the large errors on the experimental side [1].
In this work we have used the full FF approach for calculating the B → K(∗) ¯(cid:96)(cid:96) and Bs → φ¯(cid:96)(cid:96)
observables, as the main approach. For the uncertainty regarding the SM predictions only the
non-factorisable power corrections are relevant in the full FF approach. We have guesstimated
the eﬀect due to these corrections by considering either 5, 10 or 20% and also 60% errors as
described in Section 3.2.

As a crosscheck we use also the soft FF approach for an independent global ﬁt with the
same input data. In this case we make a guesstimate of the factorisable and the non-factorisable
power corrections.

For the sake of completeness, we note that in the high-q2 region a local operator product
expansion can be used. One ﬁnds small power corrections below 5% [73, 74]. Duality violation
eﬀects have been estimated within a model of resonances and have been determined to be again
below 5%. But new resonances are found in this region (see e.g. Ref. [21]), so an update of this
calculation would be desirable. The diﬀerent theory framework in the high-q2 region allows for
a non-trivial crosscheck, especially of any new physics hypothesis in the low-q2 region.

Input of model-independent analysis

We follow the methodology used in Ref. [32], but consider the following important improvement
and updates within the experimental and theoretical inputs:

• Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we have used the full form factor approach for the SM predic-
tions of the B → K(∗) ¯(cid:96)(cid:96) and Bs → φ¯(cid:96)(cid:96) observables, assuming 10% error for the power
corrections (see Sections 2 and 3.2). Crosschecks are also performed considering the soft
form factor approach and diﬀerent assumptions for the power corrections.

• We consider the LHCb measurements on the branching ratio as well as the angular observ-
ables of the Bs → φ¯(cid:96)(cid:96) decay. The theoretical treatment of the Bs → φ¯(cid:96)(cid:96) decay is similar to
the B → K∗ ¯(cid:96)(cid:96) decay, with the requisite replacements of the masses and hadronic param-
eters as well as the necessary changes resulting from the spectator eﬀects. The required
modiﬁcations can be found in [68]. Since the Bs → φ¯(cid:96)(cid:96) decay is not self-tagging, unlike
3We note that there are also additional leading (calculable) non-factorisable corrections due to the rewriting

of the soft form factors into full form factors according to Eq. (2.2).

4In Ref. [18], the central value of factorisable power corrections are determined by ﬁtting the soft form factors
to the relevant full form factors using Eq. (2.2), but the corresponding uncertainties should still be guesstimated.
From the principle point of view this procedure does not allow for any advantages in respect to the full FF form
factor approach where one uses the full QCD form factors directly with the uncertainties of the light cone sum rule
(LCSR) calculation. However, in view of the fact that there is only one independent LCSR calculation including
the correlations [72], the authors of Ref. [18] prefer to use the full form factor calculation of Ref. [19] with much
larger uncertainties. But no correlations are given in this calculation, so only this hybrid approach is possible.

about how to include this eﬀect can be found in Refs. [80–82]. We have implemented this

s − B0

s and B0

• For the B → K∗ and Bs → φ form factors we have used the combined ﬁt results of LCSR
calculations [72, 83] and lattice computations [84, 85] given in Ref. [72]. The combined ﬁt
results are applicable for the entire kinematic range of q2 (see Section 3.1).

• For the B → K form factors we have used the combined ﬁt results of LCSR calculations [86,
87] and lattice computations [88] given in Ref. [89]. The combined ﬁt results are applicable
for the entire kinematic range of q2.

• For the branching ratios of B0(+) → K0(+)µ+µ− decays, the [1.1, 6.0] and [15.0, 22.0] GeV2

bins have been used (see Section 4.3.1).

• We have calculated the theoretical errors and correlations for the B → K(∗)µ+µ− and
Bs → φµ+µ− decays with various assumptions for the power corrections as described in
Section 3.2.

• For the experimental values of B → K∗µ+µ− angular observables, we have considered both
the LHCb results determined by the maximum likelihood ﬁt method or the results for the
ﬁner bins determined by the method of moments [1] for comparison. Unless otherwise
speciﬁed, for our analysis we have considered the experimental results obtained by the
method of moments and used the recent results of the LHCb collaboration based on 3
fb−1 of data [1] for the Si observables. Alternatively, the experimental results of the
optimised observables (Pi) can be used. The latter are determined by reparametrising the
Si observables. The FL(1 − FL) dependence of the optimised observables results in large
and asymmetrical experimental errors in the bins where FL is close to zero or one, specially
for the results which have been obtained using the method of moments (see Table 9 of
Ref. [1] or Table 8 in Appendix A of the present paper).

• Some of the relevant updated input parameters of this work have been given in Table 1.
• The full list of observables that we have used as well as their SM predictions and experi-

mental measurements can be found in Appendix A.

3.1 Form factors
As mentioned above, for the B → K∗ and Bs → φ form factors we have used the combined ﬁt
results of LCSR and lattice calculations [72] which are applicable for the entire kinematic range
of q2. One should consider the following aspects:

• The form factor uncertainties are drastically reduced in the BSZ parametrisation compared
to the ones in Refs. [19, 90]. The main reason is very simple. In the latter reference the

6

authors used another LCSR approach in which the role of the B meson and the light meson
is exchanged [91–93]. Our knowledge about the B meson distribution amplitude is rather
restricted compared to the one about the light-meson amplitude. This simple fact leads to
much larger errors in this alternative LCSR approach somehow by construction. The BSZ
parametrisation goes back to the original calculation given in Ref. [83]. An independent
check of the calculation is missing.
In view of this, we vary the errors given in LCSR
calculation of Ref. [72] in our global ﬁts in order to test the impact of the error estimation
in this analysis.

• In Ref. [72] strong correlations between the QCD form factors are derived. In addition to
the standard ones due to physical input parameters, the authors argue that the equation of
motions imply the additional correlations between sum rule speciﬁc input parameters like
the threshold parameters. This might be problematic because the latter parameters are
intrinsic parameters of each separate LCSR calculations. However, these additional corre-
lations are introduced in a two-step procedure: First, separate LCSR calculations are done
without these additional correlations between the sum rule speciﬁc parameters in order to
verify that the intrinsic threshold parameters of the LCSR of speciﬁc tensor and vector
form factors have to be equal up to some variations and that also ratios of the correspond-
ing form factors are equal to one. In a second step these correlations are implemented in
the direct LCSR calculation of all QCD form factors. These additional correlations have
analogous implications as the form factor relations in the large energy limit [69]. We will
also test the impact of these additional correlations on our ﬁnal theoretical predictions.

An explicit numerical comparison between the form factors calculated in Ref. [19] (KMPW)
and in Ref. [72] (BSZ) is given in Appendix B. Moreover, a comparison for some of the angular
observables when using these two diﬀerent sets of form factors, as well as when employing the
two diﬀerent theoretical approaches (soft FF and full FF) have been given in Appendix C.

3.2 Error estimation

We have used a Monte Carlo program taking 200,000 random points for the error calculation:

• All the input parameters are varied with Gaussian distributions in their 1σ range.
• The scales µ0 and µb are varied with ﬂat distributions in the ( MW
2 , 2MW ) and ( mpole

b
2

b

, 2mpole

),

respectively.

• The form factor parameters are varied using distributions reproducing the correlation

matrices.

plitude level. The amplitudes are varied according to Ai → Ai×(cid:0)1 + bieθi + ci(q2/6 GeV2)eφi(cid:1),

• In the soft FF approach for B → K∗ ¯(cid:96)(cid:96) in the low-q2 region, the factorisable and non-
factorisable power corrections have been considered collectively at the transversity spin am-
where i =⊥,(cid:107), 0, with θi, φi ∈ (−π, π) and bi have been varied in the (−0.1, +0.1),
(−0.2, +0.2), (−0.3, +0.3) ranges and ci in the (−0.25, +0.25), (−0.5, +0.5), (−0.75, +0.75)
ranges which we refer to as 10, 20 and 30% error for the power corrections, respectively. For
the high-q2 region the multiplicity factor that we use is (1 + dieαi) with αi ∈ (−π, π) and
di ∈ (−0.1, +0.1), (−0.2, +0.2), (−0.3, +0.3) for the 10, 20 and 30% errors, respectively.
• For the full FF approach only the non-factorisable power corrections are missing, hence
considering an overall multiplicative factor for the transversity amplitudes would overes-
timate these corrections. To guesstimate the non-factorisable power corrections we mul-
tiply the hadronic terms which remain after putting C((cid:48))
7,9,10 to zero following Ref. [18].
We have multiplied the three hadronic terms by a multiplicative factor similar to the
soft FF case with bi ∈ (−0.05, +0.05), (−0.1, +0.1), (−0.2, +0.2), (−0.6, +0.6) and ci ∈

7

(−0.125, +0.125), (−0.25, +0.25), (−0.50, +0.50),(−1.5, +1.5) for the 5, 10, 20 and 60%
error, respectively. For the high-q2 region, there is no diﬀerence between the soft FF and
full FF approaches and we have considered 5, 10 and 20% errors but also 60% again.

• For Bs → φ¯(cid:96)(cid:96) and B → K ¯(cid:96)(cid:96) error estimation we have used a procedure similar to the

B → K∗ ¯(cid:96)(cid:96) decay.

• We compute the theoretical errors and correlations between all the observables which are
given in the appendices and we combine them with the experimental correlation matrices
to obtain the χ2.

We ﬁnally note that ﬁtting a polynomial ansatz for the non-factorisable power corrections
as it has been done in Ref. [34] and varying randomly the coeﬃcients of the polynomial for
an estimation of the power correction error are two diﬀerent approaches. However, if the non-
factorisable power corrections needed in the ﬁt and the power correction errors used in the
FF approach are of the same magnitude, one expects a similar compatibility with the SM
predictions. As mentioned in the introduction, the ﬁt to the data presented in Ref. [34] needs
rather large non-factorisable power corrections in the critical bins. A comparison of the ﬁtted
theory predictions with the leading contributions based on QCD factorisation ﬁnds that the
power corrections needed in the ﬁt within the critical bin from 4 GeV2 to 6 GeV2 are at the
level of observables for example +23% in S3, -42% in S5, and -44% in S4 relative to the leading
contribution. On the other hand, a 5%, 10%, or 20% estimation of the non-factorisable power
correction error described above (following Ref. [18]) leads to an error of maximal 1.5%, 3% or
6% at the observable level in S3, S4 and S5 respectively. Nevertheless the 60% error estimation
in this framework leads to 17%-20% error in these three observables. And a 150% estimation
of the power correction error is needed to reproduce errors up to 50% at the observable level
which are comparable in size with the corrections needed in the ﬁt presented in Ref. [34]. As
a consequence, one should not expect a large impact of the 5%, 10%, or 20% power correction
error in our global analysis.

3.3 Statistical methods

We use the absolute χ2 method to verify the goodness of the ﬁt in the ﬁrst step. In a second
step we consider the diﬀerence of the χ2 with the minimum χ2 to obtain the allowed regions for
the Wilson coeﬃcients (∆χ2). We always scan over a speciﬁc number of Wilson coeﬃcients δCi
at the µb scale and include all available correlations.

We also directly obtain the allowed regions from the absolute χ2. This procedure leads to
larger allowed regions for the Wilson coeﬃcients with respect to the use of the ∆χ2. One reason
for this is that some of the observables are less sensitive to some Wilson coeﬃcients, while they
contribute in a democratic way to the number of degrees of freedom. However, the statistical
meaning of the two dimensional contours within the absolute χ2 is that for a point in the 1σ
interval allowed region, there is at least one solution with the corresponding values of the Wilson
coeﬃcients that has a χ2 probability corresponding to less than one Gaussian standard deviation
with respect to the full set of measurements (see Ref. [16] for more details).

Within our analysis below we will arrive at the case that the absolute χ2 ﬁt leads to no
compatibility at 68% C.L. and the 95% C.L. regions are small. In this case, the ∆χ2 metrology
does not make much sense. This indicates the possible role of the absolute χ2 ﬁt as a check of
the goodness of the ﬁt.

4.1 Observable dependency on Wilson coeﬃcients
The tensions between the experimental measurement for B → K∗µ+µ− observables and their
SM predictions with 10% non-factorisable power corrections can be explained by modiﬁed Wilson
coeﬃcients (Ci = CSM
i + δCi), where δCi can be due to some new physics eﬀects. In Figs. 20-
22 – shown in the Appendix D – the impact of the modiﬁcation of a single Wilson coeﬃcient
for diﬀerent B → K∗µ+µ− observables has been demonstrated for the benchmark values of
δC((cid:48))
9,10 = ±1.0, where in each case all but one of the Wilson coeﬃcients have
been kept to their SM values. The eﬀect of the modiﬁed Wilson coeﬃcients on the optimised
observables are also given in Appendix D. The benchmark values for δC((cid:48))
9,10 correspond
to a modiﬁcation of ∼ 33% and ∼ 25% with respect to the SM values of C7 and C9,10, respectively.
The observables are interdependent through the Wilson coeﬃcients. While modifying some
Wilson coeﬃcients can reduce the tension with experimental data for a speciﬁc observable/bin
it can increase the tension in some other observables/bins as can be seen in Figs. 20-22 in
Appendix D. For instance, while δC7 = −0.1 reduces the tension with data for (cid:104)S5(cid:105)[2.5−4.0],
it increases the tension for (cid:104)S4(cid:105)[2.5−4.0]. Or for example, δC10 = +1.0 reduces the tension for
(cid:104)dBR/dq2(cid:105)[2.0−4.3] while increasing it for (cid:104)dBR/dq2(cid:105)[4.30−8.68] or (cid:104)FL(cid:105)[4.0−6.0]. Moreover, there
are observables which are not very sensitive to any Wilson coeﬃcient such as S7,8,9 and there
are those which are dependent to only certain Wilson coeﬃcients such as S3 which is much more
sensitive to primed Wilson coeﬃcients, most speciﬁcally to C(cid:48)
7 in q2 (cid:46) 3 GeV2 range [94] and
10 in the q2 (cid:38) 3 GeV2 region. In addition to the B → K∗µ+µ− observables, the
less so to C(cid:48)
other b → s transitions are also dependent on the Wilson coeﬃcients. Of course, in order to
get the best agreement with data one should ﬁnd the best value for the Wilson coeﬃcient(s)
through a ﬁtting with a method such as the method of least squares.

4.2 Global ﬁt results assuming new physics in one operator only

i = Ce

Considering that new physics eﬀects only appear in one operator, we make a χ2 ﬁt by scanning
over a single Wilson coeﬃcient while keeping the other Wilson coeﬃcients to their SM values.
We here use the full FF approach with a 10% power correction error.
In the case of lepton
ﬂavour universality (Cµ
i ), an 18% reduction to C9 gives the most probable scenario with
min of 123.8. Assuming this scenario to be the correct description of the b → s data, the SM
a χ2
value for C9 (corresponding to δC9 = 0) is in 3.0σ tension with the best ﬁt value (PullSM). On
the other hand, considering contributions from electrons and muons to be diﬀerent, the most
probable scenario is for Cµ
9 to receive a 21% reduction compared to the SM value for C9. The
χ2
min of this scenario is 115.5, which is signiﬁcantly reduced compared to the one in which lepton
universality is assumed. Here the SM value is in 4.2σ tension with the best ﬁt value of Cµ
9 . The
best ﬁt values of the diﬀerent single Wilson coeﬃcient ﬁts as well as their 68 and 95% conﬁdence
level regions are given in Table 2.

{C9, C10}, {C9, C(cid:48)
4.3.1 Fit results for {C9, C10}
We have ﬁrst obtained the best ﬁt value and the corresponding 1 and 2σ allowed regions when
varying the {C9, C10} set of Wilson coeﬃcients, where for the theoretical predictions of the
observables we have used both the full FF and the soft FF approaches in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2,
respectively. In the full FF approach, the allowed regions for the {C9, C10} set are similar when
considering 5, 10 and 20% error for the power corrections which indicates that up to 20%, the
power corrections are sub-dominant compared to the other theoretical uncertainties. As derived
in Section 3.2, the 5, 10 and 20% error for the power corrections at the amplitude level leads to
a 6% error at maximum at the observable level only.

This is not the case for the soft FF approach since the power corrections aﬀect both the
factorisable as well as non-factorisable corrections, while in the full FF approach only the non-
factorisable part is aﬀected. However, in both methods, considering the power corrections to

power correction error. On the left plot, the 2σ contours when removing the form factor corre-

dashed (dotted) lines, respectively. On the right plot, the solid lines correspond to the 1 and 2σ
contours when considering 60% power correction error.

be up to 20%, the SM is disfavoured at more than 2σ. For example, assuming a 10% power
correction error within the full FF method leads to a SM pull of 2.6σ, (meaning that the SM
value is in 2.6σ tension with the best ﬁt values of C9 and C10). For comparison we also show
the global ﬁts to the Wilson coeﬃcients based on the absolute χ2 method. As expected (see
Section 3.3) they lead to weaker bounds.

In the left plot of Fig. 3 the 1 and 2σ allowed regions are demonstrated, when removing
the form factor correlations or doubling as well as quadrupling the form factor errors. The
size of the form factor errors has a crucial role in constraining the allowed region; doubling
(quadrupling) the error decreases the tension from 2.6σ to 2.1σ (1.4σ). But removing the form
factor correlations does not have a signiﬁcant impact. This is due to the small uncertainties of
the BSZ form factors. If the quadruple form factor errors were considered, then the correlations
would play a more important role. Assuming a 60% power correction error in the global ﬁt has
not a big impact either as the right plot of Fig. 3 shows. As discussed above, such a guesstimate
of the non-factorisable power correction leads to errors of 20% at the observable level. That
the best ﬁt point gets slightly moved away from the SM point is a consequence of how such a
guesstimate is implemented at the amplitude level, namely within terms without dependences

on the Wilson coeﬃcients C7, C9, and C10 (see Section 3.2).

Finally, we analyse the global ﬁt to C9 and C10 with 10% power correction using the absolute
χ2 method when we do not use only one global low-q2 and one global high-q2, but also smaller
bins of the observable B → K+µ+µ−. The right plot in Fig. 4 shows the latter option. We
see that such a ﬁt does not lead to any compatibility at 68% C.L. which clearly indicates that
the ﬁt is not very good, when the data with smaller bins are used. This reﬂects the well-known
observation that the large resonance structure in the high-q2 region of this observable does not
allow for a theoretical description of this observable with smaller binning.

is mostly in C9. Compared to the {C9, C10} ﬁt, the very similar χ2 values indicate that there is
no preference between the ﬁts when considering new physics eﬀects in C10 or C(cid:48)

quadrupling the form factor error within the full FF approach (see Fig. 9).

4.4 Role of RK and S5

9

9

While the experimental measurement of S5 and its tension with the SM prediction seems to be
the main reason for a best ﬁt point of C9 about 20% less than its SM value, the S5 turns out to
be not the only observable which drives δC9/CSM
to negative values. In Fig. 10 we have given
the two operator ﬁts when removing the data on S5 while keeping all the other b → s data. It
can be seen that while the tension of CSM
and best ﬁt point value of C9 is slightly reduced in
the various two operator ﬁts, still the tension exists at more than 2σ. This feature indicates
that S5 is not the only observable that drives δC9 to negative values and other observables play
a similar role. However, the situation is diﬀerent in the case of the observable RK. In Fig. 11
from the lower right ﬁgure it can be seen that RK is the main measurement resulting in the
best ﬁt values for Cµ
9 which are in more than 2σ tension with lepton-universality (and
with 3.9σ tension with the SM). Removing the data on RK from the ﬁt, lepton-universality
can be restored at slightly larger than 1σ. So at present RK is the only observable within the
b → s(cid:96)+(cid:96)− transitions which shows some sign of lepton non-universality.
4.5 Fit results considering only B → K∗µ+µ− observables
The experimental measurements of the B → K∗µ+µ− angular observables have been obtained
using the method of moments as well as the most likelihood method. While the former gives
less precise results, it is more robust compared to the latter one, specially for low signal yields.

Figure 12: Global ﬁt results with the ∆χ2 method, using only the B → K∗µ+µ− data in the full
FF approach with 10% power correction. The coloured regions correspond to the best ﬁt value
using the method of moment results at 1 and 2σ. The solid lines depict the 1 and 2σ allowed
regions using the likelihood method results for the B → K∗µ+µ− observables.

The new physics analysis clearly depends on the method which has been used to obtain the
B → K∗µ+µ− experimental measurements. To compare the best ﬁt points when using the two
diﬀerent results we have done two operator ﬁts using only the data on B → K∗µ+µ− observables.
In Fig. 12, the coloured areas show the allowed regions at 1 and 2σ when using the method of
moment results while the solid and dashed lines correspond to the 1 and 2σ contours by using
the method of most likelihood results. We see that when using the method of moment results,
the agreement of the ﬁt with the SM is better. E.g., in the C9, C10 plane the SM has a pull of
1.7σ with the best ﬁt point when using the method of moments results, compared to 3.3σ for
the most likelihood results. The smaller tension between the SM value and the best ﬁt point
within the method of moments is partly due to small shifts in the central values and mostly due
to the larger experimental errors associated with the results of this method.

4.6 Global four operator ﬁts

There is in principle no reason to assume that new physics shows up only in one or two Wilson
coeﬃcients. Hence, it is of importance to check the global agreement of the experimental data
when allowing new physics contributions to several Wilson coeﬃcients at the time.
In this
section we consider four operator ﬁts, where in all the cases the full FF approach with 10%
power correction is used.

a χ2 of 113.3. In Fig. 13, a projection of the allowed regions at 1 and 2σ on diﬀerent Wilson
coeﬃcient planes are shown. In the upper right plot of Fig. 13, the projection of the 1 and 2σ
regions in the {Ce

contributions for muons and electrons (the same result was also seen in the two operator ﬁt with
lepton universality). In the {Ce

the allowed regions in the two and four operator ﬁts shows that considering four operator ﬁts
considerably relaxes the constraints on the Wilson coeﬃcients leaving room for more diverse
new physics contributions which are otherwise overlooked.

demonstrated. This four operator ﬁt has a best ﬁt point with χ2 = 121.6 which indicates that
the experimental measurements are better described assuming lepton non-universality as in the
two previous subsections.
In this case the SM value of the Wilson coeﬃcients has a pull of
2.3σ with the best ﬁt point. Including the primed operators with respect to the two operator
ﬁt for {C9, C10} (with χ2 = 123.7) does not improve the ﬁt5 (see also the upper left plot of
Fig. 15). The two-operator ﬁts are overlaid again in the projection plot of the four-operator ﬁt.
The comparison shows that the bounds based on the two-operator ﬁts are always stronger by
construction.

4.7 Global ﬁt results in MFV
In this section we show the impact of the b → s data within the framework of minimal ﬂavour
violation (MFV), see e.g. [95–99] and [100] for a recent review. There are diﬀerent deﬁnitions
for the MFV framework. We follow the canonical one which is based on a symmetry principle
introduced in Ref. [97], which implies that in a MFV model all ﬂavour-violating interactions

5In the four operator ﬁt there are two less degrees of freedom with respect to the two operator ﬁt.

18

Figure 15: Global ﬁt results using full form factors, with ∆χ2 method. The (light) red contour
in the upper left plot corresponds to the (1) 2σ allowed region when new physics is considered
in two operators only.

can be traced back to the well-known structure of the Yukawa couplings and all CP-violating
interactions are due to the physical phase in the CKM matrix.

The speciﬁc hierarchy of the quark masses and CKM matrix elements implies that only a
small number of operators are relevant in the MFV framework compared to a general model-
independent analysis. Here, besides the operators present in the SM, especially O7, O8, O9, and
O10, we also have to consider the scalar-density operator with right-handed b-quarks (Ol =
e2/16π2 × (¯sLbR)(¯(cid:96)R(cid:96)L)) (see Ref. [99] for more details).

The MFV hypothesis represents an important benchmark in the sense that any measurement
which is inconsistent with the general constraints and relations induced by the MFV hypothesis
unambiguously indicates the existence of new ﬂavour structures. Thus, any incompatibility of
the b → s measurements with the MFV hypothesis would imply that new ﬂavour structures are
needed to explain the data.
We have made a global ﬁt within the MFV framework using the ﬁve operators listed above.
In addition to the observables used in the previous ﬁts, we include BR(B → Xsγ) and the
isospin asymmetry of B → K∗γ, which are sensitive to the O7 and O8 operators. The best ﬁt
point has a χ2 of 123.5 for 137 degrees of freedom which represents a good ﬁt. The ﬁve operator
ﬁt within the MFV framework shows compatibility with the MFV hypothesis. In Fig. 16, the
resulting bounds on the Wilson coeﬃcients are shown.

4.8 RK and predictions for other ratios

In the introduction, we have identiﬁed the observable RK as a possible key observable to clarify
also the origin of the anomalies in the LHCb data. The ratio RK = BR(B+ → K+µ+µ−)/
BR(B+ → K+e+e−) in the low-q2 region had been measured by LHCb using the full 3 fb−1 of
data, showing a 2.6σ deviation from the SM prediction [35]. This might be a sign for lepton
In contrast to the anomalies in the angular observables in B → K∗µ+µ−,
non-universality.
the ratio RK is theoretically rather clean, in particular it is unaﬀected by power corrections
and also the electromagnetic corrections are under control. Because both tensions might be
explained by new physics in the Wilson coeﬃcients C9, other ratios of observables which may
indicate lepton non-universality will be important crosschecks of the anomalies discussed in this
paper. In Section 4.4 we found that at present the RK ratio is the only driving force for lepton
non-universality.

In Ref. [89], the authors predict the central values for such ratios based on a speciﬁc choice of
the Wilson coeﬃcients, in particular on the assumption that the electron modes are SM like. In
contrast, we make our predictions for such ratios based on the global ﬁt considering two Wilson
coeﬃcients Cµ
9. We ﬁnd that in most cases the SM point is outside the 2σ region of our
indirect predictions reﬂecting the present tension in RK (see Table 3). Moreover, the ratio in
the case of the AF B looks most promising from the theoretical point of view.

9 and Ce

Finally we note that we have shown previously [16, 31, 32], that the present data on in-
clusive and exclusive decays are compatible with each other and there is no sign of lepton
non-universality in the published data on the inclusive mode.

5 Conclusions
The LHCb collaboration has recently presented new data on exclusive b → s(cid:96)+(cid:96)− penguin
decays [1, 2]. These data were eagerly awaited because of some tensions with the SM in the
angular observables of B → K∗µ+µ−.
In view of these new data we have stressed again that there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the
theoretical accuracy of the inclusive and exclusive b → s(cid:96)+(cid:96)− decays in the low-q2 region. The
theoretical description of power corrections exists in the inclusive case so that they can be at
least estimated within the theoretical approach. On the contrary, no theoretical description of
power corrections exists in the exclusive case in the framework of QCD factorisation and SCET,
and power corrections can only be guesstimated. This issue makes it rather diﬃcult or even
impossible to separate new physics eﬀects from such potentially large hadronic power corrections
within these exclusive angular observables. Therefore, these tensions might stay unexplained
until Belle II will clarify the situation by measuring the corresponding inclusive b → s(cid:96)+(cid:96)−
observables as we have demonstrated previously [16, 31, 32].

The present situation motivated a recent theory analysis in which the unknown power cor-
rections were just ﬁtted to the data using an ansatz with 18 additional real parameters in the
ﬁt [34]. However, we have shown that this ﬁt to the data needs very large power corrections from
20% up to 50%, and even larger, in the critical bins of the angular observables. The existence
of such large hadronic corrections cannot be ruled out in principle, but they somehow question
the validity of the QCD factorisation approach for such observables.

We have analysed how the tensions in the present LHCb data depend on the input parameters
like form factor calculations and corresponding correlations and have shown that they are rather
insensitive to these inputs. Only quadrupling the form factor error makes a real diﬀerence. We
have also found that the standard guesstimate of non-factorisable power corrections from 5%
to 20% at the amplitude level has no real impact on the theoretical predictions. As we have
shown such variations lead to a 6% error at the observable level for the three observables S3,
S4 and S5. Only variations signiﬁcantly larger than 60% – corresponding to errors larger that
20% at the observable level – have a real impact. For example we have shown that for the three
observables S3, S4 and S5, a 150% of the power correction error is needed in the critical bins
to reproduce errors up to 50% at the observable level which are comparable in size with the
corrections needed in the aforementioned recent ﬁt to the SM.

In addition, we have explicitly shown that within a new physics analysis the observable S5
is not the only observable that drives the new physics Wilson coeﬃcient δC9 to negative values,

21

but also other observables play a similar role.

We have noted that the other tensions in the LHCb data of b → s(cid:96)(cid:96) may play a crucial role
in the near future, namely the observable RK with a 2.6σ deviation from the SM prediction [35]
what might signal a ﬁrst sign of lepton non-universality. In contrast to the anomaly in the rare
decay B → K∗µ+µ− which is aﬀected by power corrections, the ratio RK is theoretically rather
clean and its tension with the SM cannot be explained by power corrections. Neither some
missing electromagnetic corrections can serve as explanation for the discrepancy from the SM.
It might be just an accidental coincidence that the tensions in RK and in the angular ob-
servables can simultaneously be resolved by a negative new physics contribution to the Wilson
coeﬃcient of the semileptonic operator O9. If not, then the measurement of analogous ratios
which may show signs of lepton non-universality will be also an important crosscheck of the
anomalies in the angular observables and might even resolve the puzzle. Therefore, we have
presented predictions for such ratios based on our global ﬁts.

B Form factors

The methods used for obtaining form factor results depend on the recoil energy of the outgoing
light meson. At high-q2 which corresponds to the low recoil region, the B → K∗ and Bs → φ
form factor results are available from unquenched lattice calculations [84,85], while for the low-q2
region the form factors can be taken from LCSR calculations which are available from Ref. [19]
(KMPW) as well as from the Ref. [72] (BSZ). The theoretical errors associated with the KMPW
form factors are larger than the ones from BSZ. The larger error of the KMPW form factor is
mostly by construction and due to the diﬀerent choices of distribution amplitudes where they
employ the B-meson distribution for which less information is available compared to the K∗
meson which has been used for the BSZ form factors. Moreover, for the BSZ form factors,
interpolation with lattice data and additional correlations between LCSR intrinsic parameters
have been used which also have some eﬀect in reducing the theoretical uncertainty.

The form factor uncertainties are correlated through hadronic inputs as well as kinematic
relations at the endpoint q2=0. As claimed in Ref. [72] there are additional correlations due
to intrinsic LCSR parameters. While in the soft FF approach due the relations among form
factors at high recoil energy the number of independent form factors reduces from seven to two
form factors, and most of the latter correlations are included by construction, in the full FF
approaches analogous implications can be derived directly within the LCSR results via these
additional correlations mentioned above.

ever, they have been provided in Ref. [72] for the BSZ form factors.

Unfortunately the form factor correlations have not been given for the KMPW results, how-

C SM predictions of B → K∗µ+µ− observables with diﬀerent

theoretical approaches and form factors

In order to compare with the results of Ref. [22], we reproduced the SM predictions using KMPW
form factors within the soft FF approach and we also added the ﬁt results of Ref. [18] which
are meant to take into account the missing 1/mb factorisable corrections. These predictions
coincided nicely with central values quoted in Ref. [22] up to deviations in observables which are

very small or in the bins where there is a zero-crossing (the diﬀerence being mostly due to slight
disagreements in the choice of SM Wilson coeﬃcient values). A similar comparison was done
with the results of Ref. [72], when using the BSZ form factors in the full FF approach. Again
the results were in good agreement, and only in the bins with zero crossings and for observables
having very small values, there were some slight diﬀerences.
In Figs. 18,19, we have presented SM predictions of the central values for the most relevant
B → K∗µ+µ− observables, employing the soft FF and full FF approaches both when using
KMPW and BSZ form factors (Appendix B). In these ﬁgures, for the soft FF approach we have
not included the 1/mb power corrections which have been estimated through ﬁtting with ad hoc
functions in Ref. [18] (for the KMPW form factors). In Figs. 18,19 it can be seen that while
there are good agreement between the diﬀerent approaches and the diﬀerent form factor choices,
the signiﬁcance of the tension between central value of the SM predictions and the experimental
data depends on the particular choice of the theoretical approach as well as which set of form
factors are used. E.g., both for the SM prediction of S5 in Fig 18 and P (cid:48)
5 in Fig.19 the tension
with experimental data in the [4.0,6.0] and [6.0,8.0] GeV2 bins are smaller when using the full
FF approach with BSZ form factors, and larger when using the soft FF approach with KMPW
form factors. The situation is reversed for the P2 observables in the [4.0,6.0] and [6.0,8.0] GeV2
bins as shown in Fig. 19.
