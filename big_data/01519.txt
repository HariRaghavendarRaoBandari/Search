REGULARITY AND GROWTH CONDITIONS FOR FAST

ESCAPING POINTS OF ENTIRE FUNCTIONS

V. EVDORIDOU

Abstract. Let f be a transcendental entire function. The quite fast escaping
set, Q(f ), and the set Q2(f ), which was deﬁned recently in [9], are equal to the
fast escaping set, A(f ), under certain conditions. In this paper we generalise
these sets by introducing a family of sets Qm(f ), m ∈ N. We also give one
regularity and one growth condition which imply that Qm(f ) is equal to A(f )
and we show that all functions of ﬁnite order and positive lower order satisfy
Qm(f ) = A(f ) for any m. Finally, we relate the new regularity condition to a
suﬃcient condition for Q2(f ) = A(f ) introduced in [9].

1. Introduction

Let f be a transcendental entire function. The set of points z ∈ C for which
(f n)n∈N forms a normal family in some neighbourhood of z is called the Fatou set
F (f ) and the complement of F (f ) is the Julia set J(f ). An introduction to the
properties of these sets can be found in [2].

A lot of work has been done in recent years on a conjecture of Eremenko on the

escaping set of f . The escaping set I(f ) of f is deﬁned as follows:

I(f ) = {z ∈ C : f n(z) → ∞}

and it was ﬁrst studied by Eremenko in [7] who showed that for any transcendental
entire function f, we have I(f ) ∩ J(f ) 6= ∅, J(f ) = ∂I(f ) and all the components
of I(f ) are unbounded.

His conjecture, that all the components of I(f ) are unbounded, is still an open
question. Signiﬁcant progress has been made on the conjecture by Rippon and
Stallard who proved that I(f ) has at least one unbounded component (see [14,
Theorem 1]).
In order to do this, they considered a subset of the escaping set
known as the fast escaping set, A(f ). This set was introduced by Bergweiler and
Hinkannen in [4]. We will use the deﬁnition given by Rippon and Stallard in [12]
according to which

A(f ) = {z : there exists ℓ ∈ N such that |f n+ℓ(z)| ≥ M n(R, f ), for n ∈ N},

where

M(r, f ) = M(r) = max
|z|=r

|f (z)|,

for r > 0,

and R > 0 is large enough to ensure that M(r) > r for r ≥ R. In the same paper
they showed that A(f ) has properties similar to the properties of I(f ) listed above.
(Some of these results were shown in [4].)

The set A(f ) also has other nice properties (described in [12]) and plays a key
role in iteration of transcendental entire functions and so it is useful to be able
to identify points that are fast escaping. In [12, Theorem 2.7], it is shown that
points which eventually escape faster than the iterates of the function µε deﬁned
by µε(r) = εM(r), ε ∈ (0, 1), r > 0, are actually fast escaping.

It is natural to ask whether this µε can be replaced by a smaller function. In
this context, Rippon and Stallard introduced the quite fast escaping set Q(f ) in
[15] and in [9] we generalised this and introduced the following family of sets:

Qm(f ) = {z : ∃ ε ∈ (0, 1), ℓ ∈ N such that |f n+ℓ(z)| ≥ µn

m,ε(R), for n ∈ N},

where µm,ε is deﬁned by

logm µm,ε(r) = ε logm M(r), m ∈ N, ε ∈ (0, 1).

In this paper, we only consider the case when there exists R > 0 such that µm,ε(r) >
r for r ≥ R; in particular, we always have Qm(f ) ⊂ I(f ). For m = 1 we obtain
the quite fast escaping set Q(f ); that is, Q1(f ) = Q(f ).

Note that for 0 < ε < 1 we have µm,ε(r) < µ1,ε(r) < M(r), for any m ≥ 2 and

for r large enough, so

A(f ) ⊂ Q(f ) ⊂ Qm(f ) ⊂ I(f ).

In Section 2 we give a large class of functions for which µm,ε(r) is greater than r
for r large enough.

In [9] we considered the case m = 2, that is,

µ2,ε(r) = exp((log M(r))ε)

(1.1)

and we found regularity conditions which imply that Q2(f ) = A(f ). In particular,
we proved that any transcendental entire function of ﬁnite order and positive lower
order satisﬁes Q2(f ) = A(f ).

In this paper we introduce new techniques which enable us to generalise the

result for any m ∈ N as given in the following theorem:

Theorem 1.1. Let f be a transcendental entire function of ﬁnite order and positive
lower order. Then Qm(f ) = A(f ), m ∈ N.

In particular, Theorem 1.1 implies that functions in the Eremenko-Lyubich class
B which have ﬁnite order satisfy Qm(f ) = A(f ). Indeed, functions in the class
B have positive lower order and in fact have lower order not less than 1/2 (see
[11, Lemma 3.5]). Note that the class B consists of transcendental entire functions
whose set of singular values (that is, critical values and asymptotic values) is
bounded, and it is much studied in complex dynamics. Classes of functions that
satisfy the hypothesis of Theorem 1.1 were studied, for example, in [3] and [16].

We prove the theorem in two diﬀerent ways. The ﬁrst proof is based on a new
regularity condition and the second on a growth condition. In Section 3 we give our
ﬁrst proof of Theorem 1.1 which is in two steps. We ﬁrst introduce a new regularity
condition which we call m-log-regularity and which implies that Qm(f ) = A(f ).
Let f be a transcendental entire function. Then f is m-log-regular if and only if,

REGULARITY AND GROWTH CONDITIONS FOR FAST ESCAPING POINTS

for any ε ∈ (0, 1), there exist R > 0 and k > 1 such that

µm,ε(expm−1(rk)) ≥ expm−1(M(r)k),

for r ≥ R.

(1.2)

For m = 1 we obtain the log-regularity condition which was ﬁrst introduced by
Anderson and Hinkkanen in [1] and was used by Rippon and Stallard in [15] as a
suﬃcient condition for Q(f ) to be equal to A(f ). We then show that any function
which is m-log-regular satisﬁes Qm(f ) = A(f ). In the second step, we prove that
all functions of ﬁnite order and positive lower order are m-log-regular.

In Section 4 we prove Theorem 1.1 in a diﬀerent way, again in two steps. We
give a growth condition which is suﬃcient for Qm(f ) = A(f ) and then we show
that any transcendental entire function of ﬁnite order and positive lower order
satisﬁes this growth condition.

In [9] we introduced a regularity condition called strong log-regularity which im-
plies that Q2(f ) = A(f ). In Section 5 we show how strong log-regularity is related
to 2-log-regularity.
In particular we prove that a strongly log-regular function
of ﬁnite order is always 2-log regular and we give an example of a 2-log-regular
function of ﬁnite order which fails to be strongly log-regular.

2. Properties of Qm(f )

In this section we prove some basic properties of Qm(f ). Just as for µ2,ε, in
the general case we do not know a priori that, for any given transcendental entire
function, µm,ε(r) is greater than r for r large enough. We show ﬁrst that, for a
large class of functions, there is always a positive R such that µm,ε(r) > r, for
r ≥ R, and hence for these functions Qm(f ) is deﬁned.

Theorem 2.1. Let f be a transcendental entire function, m ≥ 2 and ε ∈ (0, 1).
If there exist q > 0, r0 > 0 and n ∈ N such that
M(r) ≥ expn+1((logn r)q),

for r ≥ r0,

(2.1)

then, for any c > 1, there exists R > 0 such that

µm,ε(r) > cr,

for r ≥ R.

Note that (2.1) is true for all functions of positive lower order as well as some
functions of zero lower order. In particular, it is true for all the functions in class
B as they have lower order not less than 1/2. In order to prove Theorem 2.1 we
use the following inequality.

Lemma 2.2. For any n ∈ N, p ≥ 1 and a1, ..., an, b1, ..., bn > 0 there exists R > 0
such that

a1 log(a2 log ... log(anr)...) ≥ log(b1 log ... log((bnr)p)...),

for r ≥ R.

(2.2)

Proof. It suﬃces to prove (2.2) for p > 1. We use proof by induction. As a1r ≥
log((b1r)p), for r large enough, (2.2) is certainly true for n = 1. Suppose now that
(2.2) is true for some n ≥ 2. We will deduce that

a1 log(a2 log ... log(an log(an+1r))...) ≥ log(b1 log ... log(bn log((bn+1r)p))...), (2.3)

4

V. EVDORIDOU

for r large enough. To do this, note ﬁrst that, for r large enough,

a1 log(a2 log ... log(an log(an+1r))...) ≥ log(b1 log ... log((bn log(an+1r))p)...),

by (2.2). Then, in order to deduce (2.3) it suﬃces to show that

(bn log(an+1r))p ≥ bnp log(bn+1r),

(2.4)

for r large enough. Note now that (2.4) is true since there exists R(= R(n)) > 0
such that

bp−1
n
p
and the result follows.

(log(an+1r))p ≥ log(bn+1r),

for r ≥ R,

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 2.1. By deﬁnition, µm,ε(r) = expm(ε logm M(r)), so we have to
show that

expm(ε logm M(r)) > cr,

for r large enough.

(2.5)

We consider three diﬀerent cases depending on the relative sizes of m and the
positive integer n from (2.1).

a) Suppose that n + 1 = m. Then, by (2.1),

expm(ε logm M(r)) ≥ expm(ε logm(expn+1((logn r)q)))

= expm(ε(logn r)q)
> cr,

for r large enough,

(2.6)

since ε(logn r)q > log logn cr = logm cr, for r large enough.

b) Suppose that n + 1 < m. Then, by (2.1),

expm(ε logm M(r)) ≥ expm(ε logm(expn+1((logn r)q))) = expm(ε logm−n−1((logn r)q)).

Hence, we need to show that, for any c > 1,

expm(ε logm−n−1((logn r)q)) > cr,

for r large enough,

or, equivalently,

ε logm−n−1((logn r)q) > logm cr,

for r large enough,

(2.7)

which holds by applying Lemma 2.2 with n replaced by m, p = 1, a1 = ε, am−n−1 =
q, bm = c and all the other coeﬃcients equal to 1.

c) Finally, suppose that n + 1 > m. Then, by (2.1),

expm(ε logm M(r)) ≥ expm(ε logm(expn+1((logn r)q))) = expm(ε expn+1−m((logn r)q)).

Hence, we need to show that, for any c > 1,

expm(ε expn+1−m((logn r)q)) > cr,

for r large enough,

or, equivalently,

ε expn+1−m((logn r)q) > logm cr,

for r large enough.

(2.8)

Note now that (2.8) is equivalent to

(logn r)q > logn+1−m(cid:18) 1

ε

logm cr(cid:19) ,

for r large enough.

(2.9)

REGULARITY AND GROWTH CONDITIONS FOR FAST ESCAPING POINTS

If we apply Lemma 2.2 with n replaced by n + 2, p = 1, a1 = q, bn+2−m =
1/ε, bn+2 = c and the rest of the coeﬃcients equal to 1 we obtain

q logn+1 r > logn+2−m(cid:18)1

ε

for r large enough and so (2.9) follows.

logm cr(cid:19) ,

(cid:3)

We now show that Qm(f ) has some basic properties similar to those of I(f ), A(f )

and Q(f ).

Theorem 2.3. Let f be a transcendental entire function and m ∈ N. Then

Qm(f ) 6= ∅, Qm(f ) ∩ J(f ) 6= ∅, and J(f ) = Qm(f ) ∩ J(f ).

If, in addition, for any c > 1, there exists R > 0 such that

µm,ε(r) > cr,

for r ≥ R,

(2.10)

then

and Qm(f ) has no bounded components.

J(f ) = ∂Qm(f ),

Proof. All the properties above hold for A(f ) (see [12]). As A(f ) ⊂ Qm(f ), we
certainly have Qm(f ) 6= ∅ and Qm(f ) ∩ J(f ) 6= ∅. Also J(f ) = A(f ) ∩ J(f ) ⊂
Qm(f ) ∩ J(f ). Since J(f ) is closed, we also have Qm(f ) ∩ J(f ) ⊂ J(f ) and so the
third property is also true.

In order to prove the two remaining properties, we follow the arguments in
the proof of [15, Theorem 2.1]. Note ﬁrst that Qm(f ) is inﬁnite and completely
invariant under f which, since J(f ) is the smallest closed completely invariant
set with at least three points, implies that J(f ) ⊂ Qm(f ). But any open subset
of Qm(f ) is contained in F (f ) since it contains no periodic points of f , and so
J(f ) ⊂ ∂Qm(f ).

Suppose now that ∂Qm(f ) ∩ U 6= ∅, where U is a Fatou component. Then
Qm(f ) ∩ U 6= ∅, and we take z ∈ Qm(f ) ∩ U. Then there will be a disc ∆ such
that z ∈ ∆ and ∆ ⊂ U. If U is simply connected then, by applying [2, Lemma 7],
we have that there exists C > 0 such that

|f n(z′)| ≥ C|f n(z)|,

for any z′ ∈ ∆ and n ∈ N. Hence, by (2.10), there exists R > 0 such that
µm,ε(r) > r, r ≥ R and ℓ ∈ N such that, for n ∈ N,

and so

|f n+ℓ(z′)| ≥ C|f n+ℓ(z)| ≥ Cµn

m,ε(R),

|f n+ℓ(z′)| ≥ µn−1

m,ε (R),

by (2.10). Therefore, any point in the neighbourhood ∆ of z lies in Qm(f ) which
gives a contradiction. If the Fatou component U is multiply connected then U ⊂
A(f ) ⊂ Qm(f ) (see [14, Theorem 2]) and so there is again a contradiction. Hence,
∂Qm(f ) ⊂ J(f ).

Finally, if Qm(f ) has a bounded component, E say, then there is an open topo-
logical annulus A lying in the complement of Qm(f ) that surrounds E. Since

6

V. EVDORIDOU

Qm(f ) is completely invariant under f , A is contained in F (f ) by Montel’s the-
orem. But from the previous property, J(f ) = ∂Qm(f ) and so a is contained in
a multiply connected Fatou component. As any multiply connected Fatou com-
ponent is contained in A(f ) ⊂ Qm(f ) we deduce that A ⊂ Qm(f ) which gives a
contradiction.
(cid:3)

3. Regularity conditions for Qm(f ) = A(f )

In this section, we use regularity conditions to prove Theorem 1.1. In the in-
troduction we deﬁned m-log-regularity which is a suﬃcient condition for Qm(f )
to be equal to A(f ). In fact, there also exists another regularity condition called
m-weak-regularity which is equivalent to Qm(f ) = A(f ). We will show later that
m-log-regularity is stronger than m-weak-regularity and hence if f is m-log-regular
then Qm(f ) = A(f ). Finally, we will use these ideas in order to prove Theorem
1.1. Note that m-log-regularity is easier to check than m-weak-regularity which is
deﬁned as follows:

Let R > 0 be any value such that M(r) > r for r ≥ R. We say that f is

m-weakly regular if for any ε ∈ (0, 1) there exists r = r(R) > 0 such that

or, equivalently, if there exists ℓ = ℓ(R) ∈ N such that

µn
m,ε(r) ≥ M n(R),

for n ∈ N,

m,ε (R) ≥ M n(R),
µn+ℓ

for n ∈ N.

For m = 1 we have the weak-regularity that was introduced by Rippon and Stal-
lard in [15].

We will show that m-weak-regularity is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for f
to satisfy Qm(f ) = A(f ). In order to prove our result we make use of the following
theorem of Rippon and Stallard (see [15, Theorem 3.1]).

Theorem 3.1. Let f be a transcendental entire function. There exists R = R(f ) >
0 with the property that whenever (an) is a positive sequence such that

an ≥ R and an+1 ≤ M(an),

for n ∈ N,

(3.1)

there exists a point ζ ∈ J(f ) and a sequence (nj) with nj → ∞ such that

|f n(ζ)| ≥ an,

for n ∈ N, but |f nj (ζ)| ≤ M 2(anj ),

for j ∈ N.

(3.2)

We now prove our result.

Theorem 3.2. Let f be a transcendental entire function. Then f is m-weakly
regular if and only if Qm(f ) = A(f ).

Proof. Suppose that f is m-weakly regular and let R > 0 be such that M(r) > r
for r ≥ R. Then there exists r = r(R) > 0 such that

µn
m,ε(r) ≥ M n(R),

for n ∈ N.

If z ∈ Qm(f ), then there exist ε ∈ (0, 1) and ℓ ∈ N such that

|f n+ℓ(z)| ≥ µn

m,ε(R),

for n ∈ N.

REGULARITY AND GROWTH CONDITIONS FOR FAST ESCAPING POINTS

7

Let r = r(R) be as above. Then there exists N ∈ N such that µN

m,ε(R) > r so

|f n+ℓ+N (z)| ≥ µn+N

m,ε (R) ≥ µn

m,ε(r) ≥ M n(R),

for n ∈ N,

and hence z ∈ A(f ). Thus Qm(f ) ⊂ A(f ). Clearly A(f ) ⊂ Qm(f ) and so we have
Qm(f ) = A(f ) as claimed.

In order to show that the opposite direction of the theorem is also true we will
prove that if f is not m-weakly regular then Qm(f ) \ A(f ) is non-empty. Take
R > 0 such that µm,ε(r) ≥ r, for r ≥ R. Since f is not weakly-log-regular, for any
ℓ ∈ N there exists n(ℓ) ∈ N such that µn(ℓ)+ℓ
(R) < M n(ℓ)(R) and hence, for any
n ∈ N with n > n(ℓ), we have

m,ε

µn+ℓ
m,ε (R) < M n(R).

(3.3)

Now, by Theorem 3.1, with an = µn

m,ε(R), n ∈ N, there exists a point ζ and a

sequence (nj) → ∞ as j → ∞, such that

|f n(ζ)| ≥ µn

m,ε(R),

for n ∈ N,

(3.4)

and

(3.5)
It follows from (3.4) that ζ ∈ Qm(f ). Also, (3.3) and (3.5) together imply that,
for each ℓ ∈ N and suﬃciently large values of j, we have

m,ε(R)),

for j ∈ N.

|f nj (ζ)| ≤ M 2(µnj

|f (nj−ℓ+2)+ℓ−2(ζ)| = |f nj (ζ)|
≤ M 2(µnj
< M 2(M nj −ℓ(R))
= M nj −ℓ+2(R).

m,ε(R))

Hence, ζ /∈ A(f ), so Qm(f ) 6= A(f ), as required.

(cid:3)

We now give the proof of Theorem 1.1. The proof is in two steps. First, we
prove the following result which implies that all m-log-regular functions satisfy
Qm(f ) = A(f ).

Theorem 3.3. Let f be a transcendental entire function. If f is m-log-regular,
then f is m-weakly regular and hence Qm(f ) = A(f ).

Proof. Suppose that f is m-log-regular and let 0 < ε < 1. Let R > 0 be so large
that M(r) > r for r ≥ R. Since f is m-log-regular, for any ε ∈ (0, 1) there exists
r0 ≥ R and k > 1 such that

µm,ε(expm−1(rk)) ≥ expm−1(M(r)k),

for r ≥ r0.

Hence,

µm,ε(µm,ε(expm−1(rk))) ≥ µm,ε(expm−1(M(r)k))
≥ expm−1((M(M(r))k)

and so, using this argument repeatedly, we have
m,ε(expm−1(rk)) ≥ expm−1(M n(r)k),
µn

Thus, whenever r ≥ r0, we have

for r ≥ r0 and n ∈ N.

µn
m,ε(expm−1(rk)) ≥ M n(r) ≥ M n(R),

for n ∈ N,

8

V. EVDORIDOU

and so f is m-weakly regular. Hence, by Theorem 3.2, Qm(f ) = A(f ).

(cid:3)

The second part of the proof of Theorem 1.1 is to show that all functions of
ﬁnite order and positive lower order are m-log-regular. In order to prove this we
will need the following lemma.

Lemma 3.4. For any n ∈ N and any d > 0, 0 < q < 1, there exists R > 0 such
that

logn(rq) > d(logn r)q,

for r ≥ R.

(3.6)

Proof. We will prove (3.6) using induction. For n = 1,

q log r > d(log r)q,

for r large enough.

Suppose that (3.6) is true for some n ∈ N. Then

d(logn+1 r)q = d(logn(log r))q < logn((log r)q),

for r large enough.

Hence, in order to prove (3.6) it suﬃces to show that there exists R > 0 such that

logn+1(rq) > logn((log r)q),

for r ≥ R, n ∈ N,

or equivalently that

log(rq) > (log r)q,

for r ≥ R,

which is true, and so, the result follows.

We now prove the following result.

(cid:3)

Theorem 3.5. Let f be a transcendental entire function of ﬁnite order and positive
lower order. Then f is m-log-regular.

Proof. Let f be a transcendental entire function of ﬁnite order and positive lower
order. We begin by noting that there exist 0 < q < p such that

erq ≤ M(r) ≤ erp

,

for r large enough

(3.7)

By the deﬁnition of µm,ε, in order to prove that f is m-log-regular, that is, that,
for any ε ∈ (0, 1), there exist R > 0 and k > 1 such that f satisﬁes (1.2) or,
equivalently,

ε logm M(expm−1(rk)) ≥ logm(expm−1(M(r)k)),

for r large enough.

(3.8)

But (3.7) implies that

and

logm M(expm−1(rk)) ≥ logm−1((expm−1(rk))q)

logm(expm−1(M(r)k)) ≤ logm(expm(krp)) = krp,

and so (3.8) is implied by

ε logm−1((expm−1(rk))q) ≥ krp,

that is,

(expm−1(rk))q ≥ expm−1(

We set rk = logm−1 s and (3.9) becomes

krp

for r large enough.

If we choose k > p/q then, for any ε ∈ (0, 1), (3.10) holds for s large enough, by
Lemma 3.4.
(cid:3)

It is easy to see that if we combine Theorem 3.3 and Theorem 3.5 we obtain

Theorem 1.1.

4. Growth conditions for Qm(f ) = A(f )

In this section we give a second proof of Theorem 1.1 by introducing a growth
condition, given in the following theorem, which implies that Qm(f ) = A(f ). The
same lower bound for m = 2 appears in [13, Theorem 6].

Theorem 4.1. Let f be a transcendental entire function, m ≥ 2 and φm(t) =
logm−1 M(expm−1(t)). If there exist 0 < q < 1 and 0 < ˜q < ∞ such that, for some
n ≥ 0,

expn+m−1((logn+m−2 t)q) ≤ φm(t) ≤ expn+m−1((logn+m−2 t)˜q),

for t large enough,
(4.1)

then

(i) for any d > 1 there exists t0 > 0 such that

φm(ψm(t)) ≥ (ψm(φm(t)))d,

for t ≥ t0,

where ψm(t) = expn+m−1((logn+m−1 t)p), pq > 1;

(ii) f is m-weakly regular and so Qm(f ) = A(f ).

Remark 4.1. As 0 < q < 1, the left bound in (4.1) becomes smaller as n increases. If
we also take ˜q > 1, then the right bound increases with n and hence the condition
(4.1) is more easily satisﬁed for larger n. As we will prove in Theorem 4.2, all
functions of positive lower order and ﬁnite order satisfy (4.1).

Proof. (i) We have that

ψm(φm(t)) ≤ expn+m−1((logn+m−1(expn+m−1(logn+m−2 t)˜q))p)

= expn+m−1((logn+m−2 t)˜qp)

and also

φm(ψm(t)) ≥ expn+m−1((logn+m−2(expn+m−1((logn+m−1 t)p)))q)

= expn+m−1((exp((logn+m−1 t)p))q)
= expn+m(q(logn+m−1 t)p)
≥ expn+m((logn+m−1 t)pq)
≥ (expn+m−1((logn+m−2 t)p˜q))d,

for any d > 1 and for t large enough,

expn+m−1((logn+m−1 t)pq) ≥ d expn+m−2((logn+m−2 t)p˜q),

for t large enough.

Thus

for t large enough.
(ii) Now let φm,ε(t) = φm(t)ε and note that from the deﬁnition of φm,

φm(ψm(t)) ≥ (ψm(φm(t)))d, d > 1,

M n(r) = expm−1(φn

m(logm−1 r)).

Note also that

µm,ε(r) = expm(ε logm M(r))

= expm(ε logm(expm−1 φm(logm−1 r)))
= expm(log(φm,ε(logm−1 r))
= expm−1(φm,ε(logm−1 r)),

and so,

Hence, in order to show that there exists r = r(R) > 0 such that

µn
m,ε(r) = expm−1(φn

m,ε(logm−1 r)).

m,ε(r) ≥ M n(R),
µn

for n ∈ N,

it suﬃces to show that there exists r = r(R) > 0 such that

φn
m,ε(r) ≥ φn

m(R),

for n ∈ N.

We showed in (i) that, for any d > 1, φm(ψm(t)) ≥ (ψm(φm(t)))d, if t is suﬃciently
large, or, equivalently, that given ε > 0

φm,ε(ψm(t)) ≥ ψm(φm(t)),

for t large enough.

Therefore,

φm,ε(s) ≥ ψm(φm(ψ−1
Since ψm(t) ≥ t, by iterating we obtain

m (s))),

for s large enough.

φn
m,ε(s) ≥ ψm(φn

m(ψ−1

m (s))) ≥ φn

m(ψ−1

m (s)),

The result follows.

for s large enough.

In order to complete the proof of Theorem 1.1 it remains to show that Theorem

4.1 can be applied to functions of ﬁnite order and positive lower order.

Theorem 4.2. Let f be a transcendental entire function of ﬁnite order and positive
lower order. Then f satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theorem 4.1 and hence Qm(f ) =
A(f ).

REGULARITY AND GROWTH CONDITIONS FOR FAST ESCAPING POINTS

11

Proof. As f is of ﬁnite order and positive lower order, (3.7) implies that, for m ≥ 2
there exist q ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ (q, ∞) such that

logm−2((expm−1 t)q) ≤ φm(t) = logm−1 M(expm−1 t) ≤ logm−2((expm−1 t)p),

for t large enough.

In order to show that (4.2) implies (4.1), it suﬃces to show that

expm−1((logm−2 t)q) ≤ logm−2((expm−1 t)q)

and

logm−2((expm−1 t)p) ≤ expm−1((logm−2 t)p),

for t large enough. Note that (4.3) is equivalent to

(logm−2 t)q ≤ log2m−3(expm−1 t)q,

for t large enough,

which, for s = expm−1 t, becomes

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

(log2m−3 s)q ≤ log2m−3 sq for s large enough.

(4.5)

By Lemma 3.4, (4.5) holds for s large enough and hence so does (4.3).

Similarly, using Lemma 3.4, one can show that (4.4) is true.

Therefore, the hypotheses of Theorem 4.1 are satisﬁed for q and p = ˜q.

(cid:3)

5. 2-log-regularity and strong log-regularity

In [9] we introduced a suﬃcient condition for Q2(f ) = A(f ) called strong log-
regularity. A transcendental entire function f is strongly log-regular if, for any
ε ∈ (0, 1), there exist R > 0 and k > 1 such that, for r > R,

log M(rk) ≥ (k log M(r))1/ε.

(5.1)

Both strong log-regularity and 2-log-regularity imply Q2(f ) = A(f ) and also any
transcendental entire function of ﬁnite order and positive lower order is both
strongly log-regular and 2-log-regular. Therefore it is of interest to know how
these two conditions are related. For a function of ﬁnite order we have the follow-
ing result.

Theorem 5.1. Let f be a transcendental entire function of ﬁnite order. If f is
strongly log-regular then f is 2-log-regular.

Proof. As f is of ﬁnite order, (3.7) implies that there exists p ≥ 0, such that

log M(r) ≤ rp,

for r large enough.

(5.2)

Also since f is strongly log-regular, for any ε ∈ (0, 1), there exist R > 0 and k > 1
such that

log M(rk) ≥ (k log M(r))1/ε,

for r > R.

(5.3)

In order to show that f is 2-log-regular we will show that, for any ε ∈ (0, 1),

µ2,ε(exp(rk)) ≥ exp(M(r)k),

for r large enough;

that is, using the deﬁnition of µ2,ε(r),

(log M(exp(rk)))ε ≥ M(r)k,

for r large enough.

(5.4)

12

V. EVDORIDOU

It is obvious from the deﬁnition of 2-log-regularity that if the condition holds for
any ε ∈ (0, 1/ep) it will hold for any ε ∈ (0, 1) and so we now ﬁx ε ∈ (0, 1/ep) and
show that (5.4) holds for this value of ε.

Consider now

n =

k log r − log log r

log k

.

(5.5)

Then kn = rk/ log r, which gives us that exp(rk) = rkn. Hence

(log M(exp(rk)))ε = (log M(rkn

))ε,

and by applying (5.3) n times, we deduce that

(log M(exp(rk)))ε ≥ k1+1/ε+...+1/εn−1

(log M(r))1/εn−1

,

for r large enough.

Therefore, it suﬃces to show that

(log M(r))1/εn−1

≥ M(r)k,

or, equivalently, that

ε(cid:19)n−1
(cid:18)1

log log M(r) ≥ k log M(r),

for r large enough.

By (5.2) it is suﬃcient to show that

ε(cid:19)n−1
(cid:18)1

≥ krp,

or, equivalently,

(n − 1) log

1
ε

≥ log k + p log r,

for r large enough.

(5.6)

In order to show that (5.6) is true we ﬁrst note that it follows from (5.5) that

n − 1 =

k log r
log k

−

log log r + log k

log k

and so

+ log k,

for r ≥ R0.

(cid:3)

The converse of Theorem 5.1 is not always true though. We now use a function,
that was constructed by Rippon and Stallard in [15, Example 6.1], in order to
prove that there exists a 2-log-regular function of ﬁnite order which is not strongly
log-regular.

We will need the following result:

REGULARITY AND GROWTH CONDITIONS FOR FAST ESCAPING POINTS

13

Lemma 5.2. Let φ and ψ be real functions deﬁned on (0, ∞) with lim inf t→∞ φ(t) >
1, lim inf t→∞ ψ(t) > 1 and such that

Then, for any ε ∈ (0, 1), there exist t0 > 0 and k > 1 such that

φ(t) ∼ ψ(t), as t → ∞.

φ(ekt) ≥ exp(

k
ε

φ(t)),

for t ≥ t0

(5.8)

if and only if there exist t1 > 0 and k′ > 1 such that

ψ(ek′t) ≥ exp(

k′
ε

ψ(t)),

for t ≥ t1.

Proof. Let

where ǫ(t) → 0 as t → ∞ and suppose that φ satisﬁes (5.8). Then

φ(t) = ψ(t)(1 + ǫ(t)),

(5.9)

k
ε
It follows from (5.9) and (5.10) that

log φ(tk) ≥

φ(log t),

for log t ≥ t0.

(5.10)

log ψ(tk) + log(1 + ǫ(tk)) ≥

k
ε

ψ(log t)(1 + ǫ(log t)),

for log t ≥ t0.

Hence, since 1 + ǫ(log t) → 1 as t → ∞, log(1 + ǫ(tk)) → 0, as t → ∞, and
lim inf t→∞ φ(t) > 1, lim inf t→∞ ψ(t) > 1, there exist k′ > 1 and t1 > 0, such that

log(ψ(tk′

)) ≥

k′
ε

ψ(log t),

for t ≥ t1,

as claimed.

(cid:3)

Example 5.1. There exists a transcendental entire function of ﬁnite order which
is 2-log-regular but not strongly log-regular.

Proof. The main idea of the proof is to use a function f constructed by Rippon
and Stallard [15, Example 6.1], which has order zero and is not log-regular (and
hence is not strongly log-regular) and show that f is 2-log-regular.

In order to show that f is 2-log-regular we need to show that, for any ε > 0,

there exist r0 > 0 and k > 1 such that

or equivalently,

µ2,ε(exp(rk)) ≥ exp(M(r)k),

for r ≥ r0,

log(M(exp(rk)) ≥ M(r)k/ε,

for r ≥ r0.

Hence, the condition we have to prove for ψ(t) = log M(et) is that, for any ε ∈
(0, 1), there exist t0 > 0 and k > 1 such that

ψ(exp(kt)) ≥ exp(

k
ε

ψ(t)),

for t ≥ t0.

(5.11)

14

V. EVDORIDOU

In Rippon and Stallard’s example, φ(t) = (log M(et))/(1 + ǫ(t)) was deﬁned as

follows:

φ(t) =(µn(t),

t ∈ [t3/4
µ(t), otherwise,

n+1, tn+1],

where µ(t) = exp(t1/2) and µn(t) denotes the linear function such that µn(t) = µ(t)
for t = t3/4

n+1, t = tn+1.

We will ﬁrst show that for any ε ∈ (0, 1), there exist t1 > 0 and k′ > 1 such that

φ(exp(k′t)) ≥ exp(

k′
ε

φ(t)),

for t ≥ t1.

(5.12)

Let ε ∈ (0, 1). When φ(t) = µ(t) = exp(t1/2), we have

φ(exp(kt)) ≥ µ(exp(kt)) = exp(exp(

1
2

kt)) ≥ exp(

k
ε

exp(t1/2)) = exp(

k
ε

φ(t)),

for t large enough, and so (5.12) holds, for these values of t.

Now suppose that t ∈ [t3/4
φ(exp(kt)) ≥ φ(exp(kt3/4

n+1, tn+1], for some n ∈ N. Then
n+1)) ≥ µ(exp(kt3/4
= exp(exp( 1

n+1))
n+1)),

n+1))
2kt3/4
ε exp(t1/2
ε φ(tn+1))
ε φ(t)),

≥ exp( k
= exp( k
≥ exp( k

for tn+1 large enough,

and hence (5.12) is satisﬁed.

Now, Lemma 5.2 implies that ψ satisﬁes (5.11) which means that f is 2-log-
(cid:3)

regular.
