Abstract

We consider the algebraic setting of classical defects in discrete and continuous inte-
grable theories. We derive the “equations of motion” on the defect point via the space-like
and time-like description. We then exploit the structural similarity of these equations
with the discrete and continuous B¨acklund transformations. And although these equa-
tions are similar they are not exactly the same to the B¨acklund transformations. We also
consider speciﬁc examples of integrable models to demonstrate our construction, i.e. the
Toda chain and the sine-Gordon model. The equations of the time (space) evolution of the
defect (discontinuity) degrees of freedom for these models are explicitly derived.

Introduction

The issue of quantum and classical integrable defects has been the subject of consistently
increasing research interest in recent years [1]–[10]. Many results from various perspectives
were produced for both quantum and classical integrable models and many interesting
interconnections were pointed out. For instance the elucidation of the local defect as a
“frozen” B¨acklund transformation [3] was a signiﬁcant observation providing a novel way
of understanding local defects for integrable classical ﬁeld theories. And although the
interpretation of the defect matrix as a“frozen” B¨acklund transformation is a notable piece
of information, a systematic Hamiltonian/algebraic description of this notion has been
hitherto missing, and this is precisely the main objective in this paper.

More speciﬁcally, we shall introduce here the notion of quasi B¨acklund transformations
for both discrete and continuous classical integrable models in the presence of local defects.
This concept is essentially associated to the local equations of motion around the defect

1

point. Note that in the usual B¨acklund transformation formulation one deals with a space
and a time diﬀerential (diﬀerence) equation, and these two equations are simultaneously
satisﬁed. In the presence of local defects however this is not the case, as the space and
time diﬀerential (diﬀerence) equations that are obtained are not satisﬁed simultaneously.
It is worth noting that these two equations in the frame of defects arise as local equations
of motion around the defect point (more details on this will be presented later in the text,
see also [10]). In the discrete case in particular one explicitly derives the time components
of the Lax pair around the defects point, and these turn out to be slightly “deformed”
compared to the bulk quantities. In the continuous case on the other hand due to imposed
analyticity conditions around the defect point the time components of the Lax pair coincide
with the left/right bulk theory quantities (for more details we refer the interested reader
to [10]). These connections are of course remarkable and a detailed analysis is given in this
article, however a deeper understanding of the particular solutions of these equations for
various physically relevant models should be further pursued (see some relevant discussion
in [7]).

Let us brieﬂy outline the content on this paper: in the next section we brieﬂy review the
auxiliary linear problem for both discrete and continuous classical integrable models. We
also recall the Darboux-B¨acklund transformations as suitable gauge transformations that
leave the auxiliary linear problem invariant. The underlying classical algebras associated
to the Lax pair are brieﬂy described, and the notion of the “dual” formulation introduced
in [11] is also presented. A note on the algebraic content of the B¨acklund transformations
is also given based mainly on the fact that the auxiliary functions are versions of classical
vertex operators [12]. In section 3 we focus on the problem under consideration i.e. the
description of the local classical defects as quasi B¨acklund transformations. More precisely,
we discuss the equations of motion associated to the defect degrees of freedom, and ascertain
their resemblance to the t part of the B¨acklund transformation. We also consider defects
along the t axis (“dual” description) and thus we are able to derive the x part of the
B¨acklund transformation. Jump conditions on the ﬁelds and their time derivatives are
also obtained similar to the ones along the x direction, and are part of the x B¨acklund
transformation conditions. The underlying algebra for the Lax matrices as well as the time
and space defect matrices are also discussed.

2 The general setting

We shall review in this section the main setting in describing continuous and discrete
integrable classical models. The formulation we pursue here is based on two main building
blocks, i.e. the auxiliary linear algebra on the one hand and the existence of an underlying
classical algebra. We shall describe below both semi and fully discrete integrable models as
well as continuous integrable theories. Moreover, we shall review the Darboux-B¨acklund
transformations as suitable gauge transformation associated to the auxiliary linear problem.

2.1 Auxiliary linear problem & Darboux-B¨acklund transforma-

tions

2.1.1 The discrete case

We begin our brief review on B¨acklund transformations in the context of the auxiliary
linear problem considering semi-discrete integrable models, i.e. models with discrete space
and continuous time parameters. We shall then brieﬂy review fully discrete models, and
in the next subsection we shall discuss the continuous space time case (see also e.g.
[13]
and references therein).

The auxiliary linear problem in the semi-discrete case is expressed via the Lax pair

(cid:16)Ln(t; λ), Vn(t; λ)(cid:17) satisfying the following set of equations:

Ψn+1(t; λ) = Ln(t; λ) Ψn(t; λ)
∂Ψn(t; λ)

= Vn(t; λ) Ψn(t; λ)

∂t

(2.1)

L, V are in general N × N matrices depending on ﬁelds (algebraic objects) and maybe on
the spectral parameter λ; Ψ is the auxiliary vector function, which may be also thought of
as a classical vertex operator (see [12]). Compatibility of the equations (2.1) leads to the
equations of the motion of the system expressed as:

∂Ln(t; λ)

∂t

= Vn+1(t; λ) Ln(t; λ) − Ln(t; λ) Vn(t; λ).

(2.2)

Let us now recall the B¨acklund transformation in this context seen as gauge transfor-
mation that leaves the auxiliary linear problem invariant. Indeed, let M be in general an
N × N matrix (Darboux matrix) [14], such that

˜Ψn(t; λ) = Mn(t; λ, Θ) Ψn(t; λ)

(2.3)

3

where Θ is an arbitrary constant.

Then the auxiliary problem reads as

˜Ψn+1(t; λ) = ˜Ln(t; λ) ˜Ψn(t; λ)
∂ ˜Ψn(t; λ)
= ˜Vn(t; λ) ˜Ψn(t; λ)

∂t

(2.4)

where ˜L, ˜V are the gauge transformed matrices. Compatibility of (2.1), (2.4) together with
(2.3) lead then to the semi-discrete B¨acklund transformations:

Mn+1(t; λ, Θ) Ln(t; λ) = ˜Ln(t; λ) Mn(t; λ, Θ)
∂Mn(t; λ, Θ)

= ˜Vn(t; λ) Mn(t; λ, Θ) − Mn(t; λ) Vn(t; λ).

∂t

(2.5)

Notice the similarity of the second B¨acklund equations (2.5) with the equations of motion
(2.2). This will be a key point, especially when discussing the issue of defects.

Let us also brieﬂy discuss the fully discrete case, where both space and time are discrete
parameters, hence two discrete indices n, m are entailed, corresponding to the discrete
space and time. This is the most intricate case, nevertheless we also provide a brief outline
here too. The auxiliary linear problem for the discrete Lax pair Lnm, Anm reads as:

Ψn+1m(λ) = Lnm(λ) Ψnm(λ)
Ψnm+1(λ) = Anm(λ) Ψnm(λ).

Compatibility of the equations above leads to the discrete equations of motion:

Lnm+1(λ) Anm(λ) = An+1m(λ) Lnm(λ).

(2.6)

(2.7)

The discrete B¨acklund transformation: consider the discrete Darboux matrix Mnm such
that

˜Ψnm(λ) = Mnm(λ, Θ) Ψnm(λ)

(2.8)

provided that the linear auxiliary problem remain invariant under the gauge transformation
the fully discrete equations for the the B¨acklund transformation arise, expressed as

Mn+1m(λ, Θ) Lnm(λ) = ˜Lnm(λ) Mnm(λ, Θ)
Mnm+1(λ, Θ) Anm(λ) = ˜Anm(λ) Mnm(λ, Θ).

(2.9)

Again the similarity of the latter equations with the discrete equations of motion (2.7) is
evident. We shall discuss the completely discrete case in full detail elsewhere, especially in
the context of time-space “duality” along the lines described in [11].

4

It is clear that taking the continuum limit in “time” we recover the semi-discrete case

described previously, i.e. consider

and

fnm(λ) → fn(t; λ)
fnm+1(λ) → fn(t + δ; λ)

Anm(λ) → 1 + δVn(t; λ)

(2.10)

(2.11)

where δ is the discrete “time” spacing parameter taken δ → 0 at the continuum limit.

2.1.2 The continuous case

Let us ﬁnally discuss the continuous case, which may be also seen as a suitable continuum
limit of the case above via “linearization”: (Lnm → 1 + δU(x, t), Anm → 1 + ˜δV (x, t)). The
Lax pair in this case U, V satisﬁes (see e.g. [15])

∂Ψ(x, t; λ)

∂x

∂Ψ(x, t; λ)

∂t

= U(x, t; λ) Ψ(x, t; λ)

= V (x, t; λ) Ψ(x, t; λ),

(2.12)

(2.13)

and the corresponding equations of motion are given by the familiar zero curvature condi-
tion

Ut(x, t; λ) − Vx(x, t; λ) +hU(x, t; λ), V (x, t; λ)i = 0,

(2.14)

where we use the notation: Ft = ∂F
(x, t) parameters transforms the auxiliary function as

∂t , Fx = ∂F

∂x . The Darboux matrix with continuous

˜Ψ(x, t; λ) = M(x, t; λ, Θ) Ψ(x, t; λ)

(2.15)

Θ as in the discrete case is an extra arbitrary parameter; M may be thought of as a local
gauge transformation.

Then due to the invariance of the auxiliary linear problem under the transformation

one obtains the equations for the B¨acklund transformation:

∂M(x, t; λ, Θ)

∂x

∂M(x, t; λ, Θ)

∂t

= ˜U(x, t; λ) M(x, t; λ, Θ) − M(x, t; λ, Θ) U(x, t; λ)

= ˜V (x, t; λ) M(x, t; λ, Θ) − M(x, t; λ, Θ) V (x, t; λ).

(2.16)

Solving the above set of equations provides the explicit form of the B¨acklund transformation
for the system under consideration.

2.2 Underlying Poisson structure & space-time dualities

Having reviewed the auxiliary linear problem and the B¨acklund transformations as gauge
transformations of the problem we can now recall the existence of the underlying classical
algebras associated to the problem. Let us note that we are going to focus here on ultra-
local and non-dynamical classical algebras. And although such generalizations can be in
principle considered they will be left for future investigation given that they are outside
the scope of the present investigation.

Let us ﬁrst consider the semi-discrete case. It is well known that in the discrete case one
may start from the L-matrix of the Lax pair and assuming that L satisﬁes the quadratic
algebra, at equal “spaces” (ultra-local algebra):

nL1n(t; λ), L2n′(t; µ)oS

=hr12(λ − µ), L1n(t; λ)L2n′(t; µ)iδnn′

(2.17)

the indices 1, 2 are associated to the “auxiliary” space, and the r-matrix satisﬁes the
classical Yang-Baxter equation. One then can build discrete space monodromies

TS(λ) = LN (λ) . . . L1(λ),

(2.18)

TS yields the charges in involution guaranteing the integrability of the system under study.
The subscript S denotes space-like description (the interested reader is referred to [11] for
more details on the “dual” description of classical integrable systems).

In the semi-discrete case the V -operator provides essentially the time evolution of the

system. Indeed, one may consider time-like monodromies

TT(n, t1, t2; λ) = P expnZ t1

t2

Vn(t; λ) dto,

t1 > t2.

(2.19)

clearly the subscript T denotes time-like description. Assuming that V satisﬁes equal times
Poisson structure [11]:

nV1n(t; λ), V2n(t′; µ)oT

=hr12(λ − µ), V1n(t; λ) + V2n(t′; µ)iδ(t − t′)

(2.20)

r is the same classical r-matrix appearing in (2.17). To conclude in the semi-discrete case
the two main assumptions for the Lax pair are given in (2.17), (2.20).

Similarly, in the fully discrete case monodromies along the discrete time direction can
be built assuming that the Lax associated Lax pair satisﬁes the following set of algebraic
relations along the discrete space and time directions:

nL1nm(λ), L2n′m(µ)oS

=hr21(λ − µ), L1nm(λ)L2n′m(µ)iδnn′

6

nA1nm(λ), A2nm′(µ)oT

=hr21(λ − µ), A1nm(λ)A2nm′(µ)iδmm′.

The corresponding monodromies are then deﬁned as

TS(λ) = LN m(λ) AN −1m(λ) . . . A1m(λ)
TT(λ) = AnM (λ) AnM −1(λ) . . . An1(λ).

(2.21)

(2.22)

We conclude then that TS, TT provide the “space” and “time” evolution of the system so
that a 2D N × M classical lattice can be then obtained.

Let us ﬁnally review the results in the continuum case based on the analysis in [11].
The space and time Poisson structure for the Lax pairs are given by the linear algebraic
relations below:

nU1(x, t; λ), U2(x′, t; µ)oS
nV1(x, t; λ), V2(x, t′; µ)oT

=hr12(λ − µ), U1(x, t; λ) + U2(µ; x′, t)iδ(x − x′)(2.23)
=hr12(λ − µ), V1(x, t; λ) + V2(µ; x, t′).iδ(t − t′).(2.24)

Then space and time monodromies may be constructed as solutions of the equations (2.12),
(2.13) respectively:

TS(x1, x2, t; λ) = P expnZ x1
TT(x, t1, t2; λ) = P expnZ t1

x2

t2

U(x, t; λ) dxo,
V (x, t; λ) dto,

x1 > x2

t1 > t2.

(2.25)

Given that space and time monodromies in both discrete and continuous integrable

models satisfy quadratic algebras we also have:

nT1(λ), T2(µ)oS,T

=hr12(λ − µ), T1(λ) T2(µ)i

we conclude that the time and space like Poisson involution is guaranteed, i.e.

ntr(TS,T (λ)), tr(TS,T (µ))oS,T

x ∈ [−L, L],

t ∈ [−T, T] L, T → ∞

= 0,

(2.26)

(2.27)

tr(TT,S) provide the charges in involution, i.e. Liouville integrability is ensured.

Moreover, as is well known starting from the L or U matrix and assuming that they
satisfy the algebraic constraints described above one may obtain the generating function
of the hierarchy V -operators associated to each one of the integrals of motion [16], indeed

7

the relevant expressions of the time components of the Lax pair in the semi-discrete case
are given by [16]

V2n(t; λ, µ) = t−1
tS(λ) = tr(TS(λ))

S (λ) trhT1S(N, n; λ) r12(λ − µ) T1S(n − 1, 1; λ)i,

(2.28)

where the following notation is introduced

T (n, m; λ) = Ln(λ) . . . Lm(λ),

n > m.

(2.29)

In the continuum case the generating function of the V -operators are derived from [16, 15]

V2(x, t; λ, µ) = t−1

S (λ) trhT1S(L, x, t; λ) r12(λ − µ) T1S(x, −L, t; λ)i.

(2.30)

considering x ∈ [−L, L]. Expansion of the V -operator in powers of λ provides the time
components Lax pairs associated to each integral of motion.

Similarly, one can also start from V and assuming that satisﬁes the “time-like” algebraic
constraints discussed earlier in the text obtain the relevant U operators as was shown in
[11], this is the so-called “dual” description. The relevant U expressions in this case then
are provided by [11]

U2(x, t; λ, µ) = t−1
tT(λ) = tr(TT(λ)).

T (λ) trhT1T(x, T, t; λ) r12(λ − µ) T1T(x, t, −T; λ)i,

(2.31)

t ∈ [−T, T].
In [11] only the continuous case was considered, however in principle a
similar construction should be possible in the context of (semi)-discrete integrable models.
We shall not comment further on the point here due to certain subtleties, which will be
hopefully addressed in a separate publication.

A note on the algebraic content of B¨acklund transformations

The algebraic content of the B¨acklund transformations will be presented in this section
given also the similarity with defect matrices, which will be discussed in the subsequent
section in more detail. The defect matrices satisfy certain algebraic constraints consistent
with the integrability of the physical system under consideration. Let us now focus on
the algebraic content of the Darboux matrices M in both continuous and discrete cases.
One can show in a straightforward manner exploiting the fact that the auxiliary function
satisﬁes a classical version of the vertex algebra [12], that the Darboux matrix M also

8

satisﬁes certain classical quadratic algebras. In [12] the discussion was restricted in the
continuous case yielding for the auxiliary function the following:

nΨ1(x, t; λ), Ψ2(x, t; µ)o = r12(λ − µ) Ψ1(x, t; λ) Ψ2(x, t; µ),

r(λ) = r(λ) − f (λ), (2.32)

where r is a solution of the classical Yang-Baxter equation, and f is a function depending
on the choice of the r-matrix.

Using similar arguments as in [12] one can show for the semi discrete auxiliary function:

nΨ1n(t; λ), Ψ2n(t; µ)o = r12(λ − µ) Ψ1n(t; λ) Ψ2n(t; µ).

(2.33)

Assume that the same Poisson structure should be satisﬁed by the gauge transformed
auxiliary function ˜Ψ = M Ψ in both the continuous and the discrete case, and also

nM1(x; λ), Ψ2(x; µ)o = 0,
nM1n(λ), Ψ2n(µ)o = 0,

continuous

discrete.

(2.34)

Then due to consistency requirements it is straightforward to show that the Darboux
matrix M satisﬁes the following quadratic Poisson algebras:

nM1(x; λ), M2(x, µ)o =hr12(λ − µ), M1(x, λ) M2(x, µ)i
nM1n(λ), M2n(µ)o =hr12(λ − µ), M1n(λ) M2n(λ)i

continuous

discrete.

(2.35)

From the duality picture described in [11] the time-like monodromies provide for the aux-
iliary function the time like Poisson structure as well.

As will be clear in what follows similarly to the case of defects classiﬁcation of rep-
resentations of the quadratic classical algebras will be the ﬁrst step into identifying the
suitable Darboux matrices, then solution of the B¨acklund relations will lead to the full
identiﬁcation of the B¨acklund transformation. The auxiliary linear problem remains to be
understood at the quantum level as well. In this context it would be very interesting to
explain how local Darboux matrices may lead to the quantum analogue of the generating
function of the B¨acklund transformation i.e. the Q operator along the lines described in
[14]. This issue is mostly relevant especially in the fully discrete case where the Q operator
may be thought of as the discrete time evolutions operator1.

Implementing defects

We come now to our main objective which is the interpretation of local defects as quasi
B¨ackund transformations using as fundamental building blocks the associated auxiliary
linear problem as well as the underlying classical algebra. The similarities between the
equations of motion associated to the defect degrees of freedom and the space and time
parts of the B¨acklund transformation as discussed in the previous section will be manifest
in what follows. Let us ﬁrst recall the formulation of integrable defects in both discrete
and continuous theories.

3.1 The discrete case

We focus on the semi discrete case (discrete space, continuous time) and assume that we
insert a defect at the nth cite of the classical system. Then the associated linear auxiliary
problem is modiﬁed as follows (see also [10]):

Ψj+1(t; λ) = Lj(t; λ) Ψj(t; λ)
∂Ψj(t; λ)

= Vj(t; λ) Ψj(t; λ),

∂t

j 6= n

(3.1)

and on the defect point in particular the problem is formulated as:

Ψn+1(t; λ) = ˜Ln(t; λ) Ψn(t; λ)
∂Ψn
∂t

= Vn(t; λ)Ψn(t; λ)

(3.2)

where ˜Ln is the defect matrix. Compatibility conditions of equations (3.2), provide the
time evolution of the degrees of freedom associated to the defect:

∂ ˜Ln(t; λ)

∂t

= Vn+1(t; λ) ˜Ln(t; λ) − ˜Ln(t; λ) Vn(t; λ).

(3.3)

The latter resembles structurally the time component of the B¨acklund transformation (2.5).
One may see the defect as a quasi B¨acklund transformation dividing the one dimensional
space into two distinct areas with diﬀerent solutions of the same or diﬀerent integrable
diﬀerential equations provided that all the Lax-pairs involved satisfy classical algebras
that entail the same r-matrix. The suitable set of algebraic relations associated to this
setting will be explicitly formulated.

The other part of the B¨acklund transformation, i.e. the “space” component can be then
obtained via the “dual” picture as described in [11], in which one considers the existence

10

of a defect along the time axis at t = t0. Let ˜Aj(t0) be the defect matrix along the time
direction, then the auxiliary linear problem is formulated as follows:

j+1(t; λ) = L±

j (t; λ) Ψ±

j (t; λ)

= V ±

j (t; λ) Ψ±

j (t; λ),

t 6= t0.

(3.4)

Ψ±
∂Ψ±

j (t; λ)
∂t

In general, we introduce the notation for any function of time F : F +, for t > t0 and F −,
for t < t0. On the defect point we have:

Ψ+

j (t0; λ) = ˜Aj(t0; λ) Ψ−

j (t0; λ)

Compatibility of the latter equation with the ﬁrst of the equations (3.4) leads to

j (t0; λ) ˜Aj(t0; λ) = ˜Aj+1(t0) L−
L+

j (t0; λ),

(3.5)

(3.6)

which is similar to the discrete space part of the B¨acklund transformation equations in
the semi discrete case (2.5). The similarity is striking one has to just make the following
identiﬁcations: ˜Aj → Mj. It is however important to note that unlike the usual B¨acklund
transformation relations, where the time and space parts are simultaneously satisﬁed, in
the case of defects the time and space relations (local equations of motion) derived above
are separately satisﬁed except on the particular point in 2D space-time i.e. (t0, x0) .

Let us also brieﬂy consider the fully discrete case. We introduce the defect along the
discrete space direction via the defect matrix ˜Ln0m. Then on the defect point the auxiliary
problem reads as

Ψn0+1m(λ) = ˜Ln0m(λ) Ψn0m(λ)
Ψn0m+1(λ) = An0m(λ) Ψn0m(λ),

and the equations of motion on the defect point are then:

˜Ln0m+1(λ) An0m(λ) = An0+1m(λ) ˜Ln0m(λ).

(3.7)

(3.8)

Similarly if we choose to introduce a defect along the discrete time direction via the defect
matrix ˜Anm0 then the auxiliary problem becomes:

Ψn+1m0(λ) = Lnm0(λ) Ψnm0(λ)
Ψnm0+1(λ) = ˜Anm0(λ) Ψnm0(λ)

and the corresponding equations of motion are then given as:

Lnm0+1(λ) ˜Anm0(λ) = ˜An+1m0(λ) Lnm0(λ).

11

(3.9)

(3.10)

Again this part of the equations of motion is very similar to the one of the parts of the fully
discrete B¨acklund transformation. The defect in any case may be thought of as already
mentioned as an object that divides the one dimensional discrete space (or time) into two
regions with distinct solutions of the same or even diﬀerent diﬀerence equations.

3.2 The continuous case

Let us complete the discussion about our setting with the continuous case in the presence
of point-like defects. We start with the space like description of the problem and we
implement a defect along the x axis at the point x0. The auxiliary problem away from the
defect point (see also e.g. [3, 6, 10])

∂Ψ±(x, t; λ)

∂x

∂Ψ±(x, t; λ)

∂t

= U ±(x, t; λ) Ψ±(x, t; λ)

= V ±(x, t; λ) Ψ±(x, t; λ),

x 6= x0

(3.11)

we introduce the notation: for any function of x, t we have F + for x > x0 and F − for
x < x0. On the defect point the problem is formulated as:

Ψ+(x0, t; λ) = ˜L(x0, t; λ) Ψ−(x0, t; λ)

(3.12)

and compatibility condition between the latter equations on the defect point provides:

∂ ˜L(x0, t; λ)

∂t

= ˜V +(x0, t; λ) ˜L(x0, t; λ) − ˜L(x0, t; λ) ˜V −(x0, t; λ)

(3.13)

where ˜V ± are the Lax pair time components computed around the defect point (see more
details on this matter in [10]). Note that around the defect point necessary analyticity
conditions were imposed (see [10] for more details)

˜V ±(x0) → V ±(x0)

(3.14)

leading to certain “jump” like conditions between the ﬁelds and their derivatives. Also,
(3.13) resembles the time part of the B¨acklund transformation in (2.16).

To obtain the x-part of the B¨acklund transformation we shall consider the “dual” time-
like description. Indeed, from the time-like perspective we impose a defect along the t axis
at t = t0, then on the defect point we have

ψ±(x, t0; λ) = ˜A(x, t0; λ) Ψ−(x,t0; λ).

(3.15)

12

Via the compatibility of the latter equations with the bulk auxiliary linear problem around
the defect point provide the x part of the B¨acklund transformation (2.16):

∂ ˜A(x, t0; λ)

∂x

= U +(x, t0; λ) ˜A(x, t0; λ) − ˜A(x, t0; λ) U −(x, t0; λ).

(3.16)

Algebraic conditions on the Lax pairs and on the defect matrix ˜L, ˜A along the x and t line
guarantying a la Liouville integrability will be discussed in the next subsection for both
discrete and continuous models. Let us note that one may choose to consider the matrices
˜L, ˜A to coincide given that these are structurally similar objects. This is paricularly
relevant if one considers the x and t evolution equations on the (x0, t0) point, where both
equations are satisﬁed simultaneously exactly as in the familiar B¨acklund transformation
setting. However if the defect is considered to be “ﬁxed” then no time or space evolution
occurs for the defect degrees of freedom. This happens only if we allow the defect to
“move” in space and time.

3.3 Underlying Poisson structure

Let us demonstrate the algebraic content of the defect matrices in both space and time
directions. The main conditions in addition to the “bulk” algebraic relations (2.17), in the
semi-discrete in the space-like and time-like description respectively are given as

n ˜L1n(t; λ), ˜L2n(t; µ)o =hr12(λ − µ), ˜L1n(t; λ) ˜L2n(t, µ)i
n ˜A1j(t0; λ), ˜A2j(t0; µ)o =hr12(λ − µ), ˜A1j(t0; λ) ˜A2j(t0; µ)i.

(3.17)

The modiﬁed space and time monodromies for the semi-discrete case, in the presence of
defects

TS(λ) = LN (λ) . . . ˜Ln(λ) . . . L1(λ)

TT(λ) = P expnZ T

t+
0

V +(x, t; λ)dto ˜A(x, t0; λ) P expnZ t−

−T

0

V −(x, t; λ)dto.(3.18)

Similarly, in the fully discrete case the algebraic constraints for ˜L and ˜A are given as

n ˜L1n0m(λ), ˜L2n0m(µ)oS
n ˜A1nm0(λ), ˜A2nm0(µ)oT

=hr12(λ − µ), ˜L1n0m(λ) ˜L2n0m(µ)i
=hr12(λ − µ), ˜A1nm0(λ) ˜A2nm0(µ)i

with discrete space and time modiﬁed monodromies deﬁned as

(3.19)

TS(λ) = LN (λ) . . . ˜Ln(λ − Θ) . . . L1(λ)

13

TT(λ) = AM (λ) . . . ˜Am(λ − Θ) . . . A1(λ).

(3.20)

Finally, in the continuum case the algebraic relations that hold for the ˜L and ˜A matrices

on a speciﬁc space and time point respectively:

and the corresponding modiﬁed monodromies are deﬁned as

(3.21)

n ˜L1(x0, t; µ), ˜L2(x0, nt; λ)o =hr12(λ − µ), ˜L1(x0, t; λ) ˜L2(x0, t, µ)i
n ˜A1(x, t0; λ), ˜A2(x, t0; µ)o =hr12(λ − µ), ˜A1(x, t0; λ) ˜Aj(x, t0; µ)i,
TS(λ) = P expnZ L
TT(λ) = P expnZ T

U +(x, t; λ)dxo ˜L(x0, t; λ) P expnZ x−
V +(x, t; λ)dto ˜A(x, t0; λ) P expnZ t−

x+
0

−T

t+
0

U −(x, t; λ)dxo
V −(x, t; λ)dto. (3.22)

0

−L

0

Given the above algebraic conditions one may show that the trace of the modiﬁed mon-
odromies provide charges in involution in the both time or space direction,

ntr(TS,T(λ), tr(TS,T(µ))oS,T

= 0.

(3.23)

As discussed in the bulk case in the previous section starting from the L or U matrix
and assuming that they satisfy certain algebraic constraints one may obtain the various V
operators associated to each one of the integrals of motion [16]. Similarly in the presence
of point like defects one can construct the time component of the Lax pair given the L or
U and ˜L matrices and the associated algebraic constraints. The relevant expressions of the
time components of the Lax pair in the semi-discrete case in the presence of defects are
given by [10]

V2n(t; λ, µ) = t−1

V2n+1(t; λ, µ) = t−1

S (λ) trhT1S(N, n + 1; λ) ˜L1n(λ) r12(λ − µ) T1S(n − 1, 1; λ)i
S (λ) trhT1S(N, n + 1; λ) r12(λ − µ) ˜L1n(λ) T1S(n − 1, 1; λ)i.(3.24)

In the continuum case the generating function of the V -operators computed on the

defect point from the left and from the right are given as [10]

˜V −

˜V +

2 (x0, t; λ) = t−1(λ) trhT1S(L, x0, t; λ) L1(x0, t; λ) r12(λ − µ) ˜T1S(x0, −L, t; λ)i
2 (x0, t; λ) = t−1(λ) trhT1S(L, x0, t; λ) r12(λ − µ) ˜L1(x0, t; λ) T1S(x0, −L, t; λ)i(3.25)

considering x0 ∈ [−L, L]. ˜V ± as we have already commented before are the matrices
computed on the defect point from the left and from the right. The bulk quantities are
given by the usual expressions (2.30).

14

Similarly, one can consider the time-like approach start from V, ˜A and assuming that
they satisfy time-like algebraic constraints obtain the relevant U operators. The relevant
U expressions are then given as around the defect point

˜U −
2 (x, t0; λ) = t−1
˜U +
2 (x, t0; λ) = t−1

T (λ) trhT1T(x, T, t0; λ) ˜A1(x, t0, λ) r12(λ − µ) T1T(x, t0, −T; λ)i
T (λ) trhT1T(x, T, t0; λ) r12(λ − µ) ˜A1(x, t0, λ) T1T(x, t0, −T; λ)i(3.26)

t0 ∈ [−T, T]. Similarly to the space-like description analyticity conditions around the
defect point:

˜U ±(t0) → U ±(t±
0 )

(3.27)

lead to “time jump” conditions on the ﬁelds and their time derivatives. The bulk quantities
coincde with the ones given in (2.31).

Here as in [11] we focus only on expressions regarding the continuous case. Similar
expressions may be in principle identiﬁed in the discrete case, but this is left as a separate
investigation given that it involves certain intricate issues.

4 Two examples

In order to demonstrate the formulation of the local defects as quasi B¨acklund transfor-
mations we provide below two speciﬁc examples of discrete and continuous cases, where
defects are treated as (quasi) B¨acklund transformations. In particular, we shall focus on
two prototype integrable models, the Toda chain and the sine-Gordon model.

4.1 The Toda chain

Consider the Toda chain in the presence of a space like defect. We insert the local defect
represented by the defect matrix ˜L at the nth cite of the one dimensional system. The bulk
Lax pair of the model is given by:

Lj(λ) = λ − pj

−e−qj

eqj

0 ! ,

j 6= n.

(4.1)

The space Poisson commutator for the dynamical quantities qi, pi emanate from the alge-
braic relations (2.17) with the r-matrix being the Yangian [17],

r(λ) =

P
λ

, P

the permutation operator.

(4.2)

15

nαn, βno = βn
nαn γno = −γn
nβn γno = 2αn.

(4.6)

(4.7)

then

We may implement two types of defects, i.e. type I given by the matrix

nqi, pjoS

= δij.

˜L(I)

0! ,
n (λ) = λ − Θ + Nn xn

−Xn

and type II with with the L matrix given as

˜L(II)

n

(λ) = λ − Θ + αn

γn

βn

λ − Θ − αn! .

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

Given that ˜L(I,II) satisfy the quadratic algebra (3.17) with the Yangian r-matrix then the
Poisson relations for the dynamical degrees of freedom are then given via (3.17) as:

and for the type II defect:

nxn, Xno = 1.

Expanding the log tr(TS(λ)) in the presence of defect in powers of λ−1 we obtain the local
integrals of motion. Note that type I defects provide rather trivial results, especially in
the context of the quasi B¨acklund transformations, therefore we shall focus henceforth on
type II results. In particular, the momentum and Hamiltonian for type II defects are given
below

pj + αn

P = −Xj6=n
2Xj6=j

H = −

p2

j − Xj6=n,n−1

eqj+1−qj − eqn+1−qn−1 − βne−qn−1 − γneqn+1 −

. (4.8)

From the expansion of the expression providing the time component of the Lax pair (4.1)
we identify around the defect point:

eqn+1 + βn

−e−qn−1

0

˜Vn =  λ
˜Vn+1 = 

!
0 ! .

eqn+1

λ

γn − e−qn−1

16

(4.9)

It is clear that the latter expressions are slightly “deformed” compared to the bulk expres-
sions away from the defect (see relevant discussion in [10] in the context of the discrete
NLS model). The bulk V -matrix is given in as

Vj(λ)  λ

−e−qj−1

eqj

0 !

j 6= n, n + 1.

(4.10)

Let us now consider the equations of motion related to the defect degrees of freedom

i.e. the time component of the semi-discrete quasi B¨acklund transformation:

∂ ˜Ln
∂t

= ˜Vn+1 ˜Ln(λ) − ˜Ln(λ) ˜Vn(λ).

(4.11)

Solving the latter equation provides the following set of relations for the time evolution of
the degrees of freedom of the defect:

˙αn = eqn+1 γn + e−qn−1 βn
˙βn = −2αneqn+1 − (αn − Θ)βn
˙γn = −2αne−qn−1 + (αn − Θ)γn

(4.12)

the “dot” denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to time. It is also relevant to consider the
equations of motion around the defect point at n ± 1 given that these are slightly modiﬁed
compared to the bulk ones due to the presence of the “deformed” ˜Vn, ˜Vn+1, indeed

∂Ln+1(λ)

∂t

∂Ln−1(λ)

∂t

= Vn+2(λ) Ln+1(λ) − Ln+1(λ) ˜Vn+1(λ)

= ˜Vn(λ) Ln−1(λ) − Ln−1(λ) Vn−1(λ),

(4.13)

which lead respectively to the following extra conditions among the relevant ﬁelds and the
defect degrees of freedom

and

˙qn+1 = pn+1 − Θ
˙pn+1 = eqn+2−qn+1 − eqn+1(γn − e−qn−1)

˙qn−1 = pn−1 − Θ
˙pn−1 = −eqn−1−qn−2 + e−qn−1(βn + eqn+1)

(4.14)

(4.15)

These equations may be thought “deformed equations” of motion around the defect point.
Indeed, compare the latter equations with the familiar bulk equations for j 6= n, n ± 1

˙qj = pj

17

˙pj = eqj+1−qj − eqj −qj−1.

(4.16)

Naturally, the main objective is to solve the equations around the defect point and un-
derstand the time evolution and thus the behavior of the defect degrees of freedom. More
precisely, we can consider situations with zero, one or two discrete solitons and see how
their presence aﬀects the time evolution of the defect degrees of freedom. The detailed
analysis of the latter equations will be discussed in detail elsewhere. It is worth noting
that as opposed to the continuous case no analyticity conditions around the defect point
are considered, thus on requires a “cluster” of equations of motion around the defect point
in order to examine the time evolution of the defect.

Note also that the space part of the discrete B¨acklund transformation can be obtained
via the dual description, however this requires the identiﬁcation of L, ˜L starting from
V . This however is a subtle issue, which will be separately addressed in a forthcoming
publication.

4.2 The sine-Gordon model

The sine-Gordon model in the presence of local defects has been extensively studied (see e.g.
[3, 10, 6]) the last decade or so. Time evolution equations were derived for the degrees of
freedom of the defect for type II defects. The connection of these equations with the sewing
conditions derived in [10] as analyticity conditions was apparent, and quite surprising. This
will be particularly evident in the explicit computations below when dealing with the time
part of the B¨acklund transformation.

Let us ﬁrst introduce the Lax pair for the sine-Gordon model:

U(x, t; λ) =

V (x, t; λ) =

1

2 
2 

−Wt

sinh(λ + W )

sinh(λ − W )

Wt

1

−Wx

cosh(λ + W )

cosh(λ − W )

Wx

! ,
!

(4.17)

where W = iβ
2 φ, φ is the sine-Gordon ﬁeld. As in the case of the Toda chain, one may
consider two types of defects, type I associated to the deformations of the harmonic os-
cillator algebra and type II associated to a suitable deformations of the sl2 algebra. The
corresponding defect matrices are given below for the two types of defects:

˜L(I)

eλZ X −1 ! ,
n (λ) =  X eλZ −1

18

(4.18)

and the type II defect matrix

˜L(II)

n

(λ) = eλV − e−λV −1

a

¯a

eλV −1 − e−λV! .

(4.19)

We shall basically focus hereafter on type II defects (see also [3, 10]) given that type I
defect gives rise to the familiar B¨acklund transformation for the sine-Gordon model, and
the degrees of freedom of the defect somehow “disappear”, given that they are eventually
exclusively expressed in terms of the left/right bulk ﬁelds. It is worth pointing out that
the type II defect matrix may be expressed as the product of two type I matrices (see
e.g. [3] and references therein). This of course will have certain implications when solving
the space and/or time part of the B¨acklund transformation, especially given the fact that
products of fundamental B¨acklund transformations provide multi-solitonic solutions. This
is a signiﬁcant issue that merits further investigation.

Both types I and II defect matrices satisfy the quadratic algebra (3.21), with the trigono-

metric r-matrix (see [15] and references therein):

r(λ) =

β2

8 sinh(λ)  σz +1

2

cosh(λ)
σ+

σ−

cosh(λ)! .

−σz +1

2

(4.20)

One may then deduce the algebraic relations for the degrees of freedom of the defect:

{a, V} =

{¯a, V} = −

V¯a

β2
8

Va
β2
8
β2
4

{a, ¯a} = −

(V 2 − V −2)

(4.21)

the latter may be thought of as a deformation of the classical sl2 algebra.

We shall solve now both B¨acklund transformation relations for the type II defect. Let us
ﬁrst consider the time component of the relations (3.13) based on the space-like description
of the model. Solving (3.13) we obtain the following set of relations describing the time
evolution of the defect degrees of freedom (see also [10] for a similar set of relations)

2¯at = −¯a(W +

x + W −

x ) − 2 cosh(

− Θ) sinh(W + − W −)

2at = a(W +

x + W −

x ) + 2 cosh(

(4.22)

W + + W −

W + + W −

Compatibility conditions of the latter equations lead to the following equation

¯a
2

sinh(

W + + W −

(4.24)

The relations above agree with the respective relations derived in [10]. It is worth noting
that part of these relations arise as analyticity conditions on the time components of the Lax
pair, a fact that provides a very strong consistency check of the methodology introduced
in [10]. Moreover, in [10] the time part of the B¨acklund transformation in both discrete
and continuous models is basically derived and thought of as providing the local equations
of motion on the defect point. As in the discrete case it would be informative to solve the
equations using zero, one or two soliton solutions and obtain the respective time evolution
of the dynamical degrees of freedom of the defect.

Here, we also provide the dual picture along the lines described in [11], giving rise to

the x component of the B¨acklund transformation (3.16)

2¯ax = −¯a(W +

t + W −

t ) − 2 sinh(

− Θ) sinh(W + − W −)

2ax = a(W +

cosh(

2

− Θ) −

2

cosh(

(4.27)

It is worth emphasizing once more that the equations derived above as t and x evo-
lutions of the defect degrees of freedom are not satisﬁed simultaneously as it happens in
the usual B¨acklund transformation frame. To conclude in the continuum case the x and
t relations separately are precisely the same with x and t part of the B¨acklund trans-
formation relations, but still they are not simultaneously satisﬁed, hence the appellation
quasi B¨acklund transformations still holds. A more detailed discussion on the solution of
the derived quasi B¨acklund transformations and the corresponding behavior of the defect
degrees of freedom will be presented in a forthcoming publication.

20

Another problem one may address in this context is the issue of classical scattering.
This can be studied by acting on the auxiliary function with various B¨acklund transfor-
mations, and then consider the asymptotic behavior of the auxiliary function. Moreover
this will provide signiﬁcant information on the physical behavior of the defect and its in-
teraction with the produced solitons. This is a very interesting issue, that certainly merits
detailed investigation.
