ABSTRACT

Semiconductor-based quantum dot single-electron pumps are currently the most promising candidates for the direct realiza-
tion of the emerging quantum standard of the ampere in the International System of Units. Here, we discuss a silicon quantum
dot single-electron pump with radio frequency control over the transparencies of entrance and exit barriers as well as the dot
potential. We show that our driving protocol leads to robust bidirectional pumping: one can conveniently reverse the direction
of the quantized current by changing only the phase shift of one driving waveform with respect to the others. We also study
the improvement in the robustness of the current quantization owing to the introduction of three control voltages in comparison
with the two-waveform driving. We anticipate that this pumping technique may be used in the future to perform error counting
experiments by pumping the electrons into and out of a reservoir island monitored by a charge sensor.

Introduction
After a quarter of a century of development of charge pumps, we are close to redeﬁning the International System of Units
(SI) standard for the electrical current, the ampere, such that it would be based on a ﬁxed value of the elementary charge.1, 2
The direct experimental realization of such a quantum ampere standard is based on charge pumps which transfer accurately
an integer n number of electrons per cycle from the source to the drain at frequency f , yielding direct current I = ne f . The
parameter region where the pumped current is quantized in such a way and where it is insensitive to changes in the system
parameters is referred to as a plateau. For practical realizations of the current standard and for the closure of the so-called
quantum metrology triangle, it is sufﬁcient that the pump yields a current of hundreds of picoamperes with relative accuracy
of 10−8.3–5

The very ﬁrst charge pumps were able to produce currents of a few picoamperes with accuracies of a few per cent.6–9
After this, several different implementations of charge pumps have been proposed and tested: normal-metal tunnel junction
devices,10, 11 superconducting devices,12–14 superconductor–normal–metal hybrid turnstiles,15–20 and surface acoustic wave
devices.21, 22 At the moment, the most promising candidates for the emerging quantum ampere are semiconductor quantum
dots23–34 and single-atom impurities in semiconductors,35–38 the state of the art being, a current of 87 pA in a GaAs/AlGaAs
quantum dot with an uncertainty of less than 0.2 parts per million (ppm).26 Silicon single-electron pumps have also been
studied widely.31–36, 39–42 Beneﬁts of silicon pumps are that they are based on technologies well-known by the industry and
they may exhibit suppressed 1/ f noise and the absence of large random charge jumps.43–47

The accuracy of a charge pump can be determined with a charge sensor that monitors the charge state of a reservoir island
into which electrons are pumped. Several different charge sensing schemes have been demonstrated: pumping electrons into
and out of the reservoir,10, 39, 40, 48 pumping a number of electrons into the reservoir and cyclically emptying it,49 monitoring
multiple reservoirs interleaved with pumps in a series conﬁguration,20, 50, 51 and monitoring the pump dot without any storage
node.27 In general, pumping electrons into and out of a reservoir in semiconductor devices is highly nontrivial due to the
asymmetry of the devices and pumping protocols.

In this paper, we demonstrate bidirectional electron pumping in a silicon-based quantum dot by employing a three wave-
form protocol, thus offering a step towards error counting based on a reservoir dot. Our technology allows simultaneous
control over both barriers and the dot potential, enabling convenient switching between the pumping directions. We also show
the improvement of this pumping process over a two-waveform drive using the same driving amplitudes. This is conﬁrmed

by the study of the sensitivity of the current quantization to experimental parameters such as the plunger gate (PL) dc voltage
and the rf amplitude of the drive.

Results
Pumping with three waveforms
A scanning electron microscope image of our quantum dot device and a schematic measurement set-up are presented in
Fig. 1(a). The details of forming a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and a single-electron dot isolated from the leads
are discussed in Refs. 33, 49, 52. Initially, we pump with sinusoidal radio frequency (rf) waveforms applied to PL and to the
barrier right gate (BR) with a phase difference of PL with respect to BR, f BR-PL = 95◦ at 800 mK temperature. We electrically
conﬁne the dot by setting negative bias on the conﬁning gates C1 and C2, with gate voltages VC1 and VC2, respectively.33, 53
Then we search in the dc parameter space for a stable pumping plateau in the positive current direction, i.e., BR corresponds
to the entrance barrier and the barrier left gate (BL) to the exit barrier. Here, we deﬁne the ﬁrst plateau as the parameter region
for which the normalized pumped current, I/e f is within 5% of unity. Subsequently, we decrease the dc potential on BL, VBL,
i.e., we make the exit barrier more opaque, until we measure only a narrow pumping plateau as a function of PL and BR dc
voltages, VPL and VBR respectively. At this point, our pumping process is limited by the unloading process. Then we drive
BL a sinusoidal waveform 180◦ phase-shifted with respect to BR so that all the waveforms are sines by ˜VBR = ABR sin(w t),
˜VPL = APL sin(w t + f BR-PL), and ˜VBL = ABL sin(w t + 180◦).

A schematic illustration of the pumping process with three pulses is presented in Fig. 1(b). First (I) we lower the entrance
barrier and the potential of the dot such that an electron tunnels into the dot. In the second phase, (II) the entrance barrier
is raised and the electron is trapped in the dot. Then the electron is unloaded (III) by lowering the exit barrier and raising
the dot potential. The time dependence of the potentials is presented in Fig. 1(c). The normalized pumped current, I/e f , at
f = 200 MHz is shown as a function of VPL with varying ABL in Fig. 1(d). The length of the ﬁrst plateau increases signiﬁcantly
with higher ABL. Note also that with low amplitudes there is no second plateau, but with high amplitudes the second plateau
corresponding to transfer of two electrons per cycle is clearly visible.

Not only does the length of the plateaus increase with increasing ABL but the current quantization becomes more accurate,
i.e., the pumped current is closer to the expected value. The inset of Fig. 1(d) shows that with low amplitude, the normalized
pumped current at the ﬁrst plateau is below unity by a few per cent. However, with high amplitudes the normalized current
reaches unity more precisely which indicates a more robust unloading process.

Stability of the pumping process
We also study the stability of the pumping process by measuring the pumped current as a function of VPL, VBR, and VBL. We
begin by pumping with PL and BR as described above, but decrease ABR until we measure only a narrow plateau region in
terms of VPL, VBR, and VBL. We measure the pumped current as a function of VPL and VBR and as a function of VPL and VBL.
We repeat these scans with different ABL values. The results are shown in Fig. 2(a). We observe that the plateau enlarges in
the parameter space (VPL, VBR, and VBL) with increasing ABL. The maximum length of the plateau in terms of VPL increases
from 14 to 52 mV as ABL increases from 0 to 123 mV.
This experiment is repeated in the case where the exit barrier is BR, i.e., the opposite pumping direction. We pump
initially with PL and BL using PL phase difference w.r.t. BL as f BL-PL = 120◦ at 100 MHz. A third waveform (complement
waveform to that of BL) is applied to BR. The waveforms are: ˜VBL = ABL sin(w t), ˜VPL = APL sin(w t + f BL-PL), and ˜VBR =
ABR sin(w t + 180◦). We observe a similar widening of the plateau in Fig. 2(b) as in Fig. 2(a). However, in this case the length
of the plateau in VPL reaches a maximum around ABR = 79 mV, inferring that the BR gate couples to the quantum dot more
strongly than the BL gate. For simplicity, we do not compensate this coupling in the experiment. Therefore the increased
amplitude in BR interferes with the pumping process more than that in BL, restricting our ability to improve the pumping
process beyond the observed optimal point. The maximum length of the plateau in terms of VPL increases from 12 mV to 25
mV as ABR increases from 0 to 79 mV.

The maximum length of the plateau in VPL as a function of the exit barrier amplitude extracted from the data of Fig. 2(a)
and 2(b) is presented in Fig. 2(c). In both scenarios, the length increases rather linearly as we increase the amplitude of the
exit barrier, but in the case of BR, we observe a maximum.

Bidirectional pumping
Let us choose the values of VBR, VBL, and ABR such that they correspond to the maximum plateau length in Fig. 2(b). Then we
measure the pumped current as a function of VPL and f BL-PL with the results shown in Fig. 3(a). The pumping plateaus in both
directions have the same midpoint, VPL = 0.823 V. Thus in comparison to bidirectional pumping observed with two drives in
a similar sample,33 we can pump in both directions with ﬁxed VPL value, whereas with only two drives we needed a different
phase and VPL.

We examine the cross sections along VPL with two phase differences, f BL-PL = 120◦ and f BL-PL = 240◦. The absolute value
of the pumped current in both cases is shown in Fig. 3(b). In the region where VPL = 0.820 − 0.826 V, the absolute magnitude
of current in each direction is the same within the experimental uncertainty. In the middle of this region (at VPL = 0.823 V)
we study the cross section of Fig. 3(a) along the phase difference f BL-PL, as shown in Fig. 3(c). We clearly observe that the
pumping plateau appears in the negative direction in the range f BL-PL = 40 − 160◦ and in the positive direction in the range
f BL-PL = 200 − 290◦.

Discussion
We have demonstrated robust bidirectional pumping with convenient switching between the pumping directions in a silicon
single-electron pump with independent rf control over both barriers and the dot potential. Initially, we pump with the entrance
barrier and PL, then we introduce a third rf waveform to the exit barrier. We study the effect of the amplitude of the exit barrier
swing on the pumped current and observe that it can increase the length of the current plateau in the parameter space of applied
gate potentials without the need to increase the amplitudes of the other drives. Subsequently, we studied the pumped current as
a function of the plunger gate voltage and the phase difference of the plunger drive with respect to the barrier drives. We ﬁnd
a parameter region where we can perform pumping in positive and negative directions simply by changing the phase of the
plunger drive. Furthermore, there is a parameter region where the magnitudes of the pumped currents in different directions
are equal within experimental accuracy.

Our architecture, which incorporates individual control over both barriers and the quantum dot is highly ﬂexible. It allows
convenient switching between the pumping directions simply by changing the phase of the plunger gate rf drive. This property
can potentially be used to extend the basic electron counting scheme demonstrated in Ref. 49, to a more sophisticated error
counting protocol,10 where single electrons are pumped back and forth between source and reservoir, without accumulating
electrons in the reservoir. A pumping scheme with three rf drives may also be used to further reduce the uncertainty of output
current of the semiconductor quantum dot pumps.

Methods

Sample fabrication
Our quantum dot is based on a three-layer gate-stack silicon metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology. The sample is
fabricated on a high-purity intrinsic silicon wafer. A 8-nm thick SiO2 layer thermally grown in the active region to form the
gate–channel oxide. Three layers of aluminum gates with thicknesses 30, 55, and 80 nm, respectively are fabricated on top of
the wafer with electron beam lithography. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA 950k) A4 resist is used as a mask material. After
patterning the mask, we develop it in a mixture of methyl isobutyl ketone and isopropanol (MIBK:IPA 1:3) solution. Each
layer of Al gates is deposited with a thermal evaporator, followed by a lift-off process. The gates are oxidized on a hot plate in
an ambient environment. This process is repeated in total three times to realize all the layers. The source and drain electrodes
are connected to the 2DEG with phosphorus-doped regions which form the ohmic contacts. Further details of the fabrication
process are discussed elsewhere.52

Measurement set-up
All the experiments are performed in a self-made, torlon-based, plastic dilution refrigerator with base temperature of 100
mK submerged in 4-K helium bath. The device is cooled down to base temperature but due to the dissipation on the line
impedances, the mixing chamber temperature increases during the experiments up to 800 mK. The device is mounted on a
sample holder printed circuit board (PCB) with integrated bias tees with capacitance 10 nF and resistance 100 kW
. This allows
simultaneously application of rf and dc voltages on the driving gates. Our silicon chip is attached to the sample stage with
vacuum grease and wedge-bonded to the PCB with Al bond wires. The rf driving voltages from the room temperature set-up
are connected to the PCB with coaxial cables with 10 dB attenuation at 4 K. The dc voltages are connected to the PCB with
twisted-pair loom lines. The wiring of the sample and the cryostat is discussed in more detail in Ref. 52.

A 2DEG is induced at the interface between Si and SiO2 by applying positive voltage to the Al gates. All dc gate
voltages are generated by ﬂoating dc voltage sources connected to 1:5 voltage dividers. The rf waveforms are generated by
an arbitrary waveform generator and synchronized with a rubidium frequency standard. These waveforms are attenuated at
room temperature depending on the experiment. The output current is ampliﬁed by 1010 V/A with a transimpedance ampliﬁer
powered by a regulated battery pack. The ampliﬁed signal is optoisolated to eliminate ground loops and subsequently recorded
by a digital multimeter.

Figure 1. Sample and pumping protocol. (a) Scanning electron microscope image of a sample similar to the one used in the
experiments together with the schematic measurement setup. The lateral position of the quantum dot is indicated by an
orange oval. Blue squares indicate the ohmic contacts of source and drain to the two-dimensional electron gas. (b) Schematic
potential landscapes for an electron along the red line in (a) at different phases of the pumping process. The whole process
consists of electron loading (I), trapping (II), and unloading (III). (c) Time dependence of the electrical potentials (solid lines)
in three-waveform driving scheme and the Fermi level (dashed line). The gray lines indicate the time instants visualized in
(b). (d) Pumped current as a function of plunger gate voltage, VPL, with different amplitudes of the driving voltage on the left
barrier, ABL, at 200 MHz frequency. Inset: The pumped current from the main panel in the vicinity of plateau I/e f = 1. The
dc gate voltages deﬁned in (a) assume the following values: VSL = 3.5 V, VDL = 1.8 V, VC1 = −0.40 V, VC2 = −0.50 V,
VBL = 0.80 V, and VBR = 0.72 V. The rf driving amplitudes are ABR = 158 mV, and APL = 79 mV with phase difference
f BR-PL = 95◦.

Figure 2. Stability of the pumped current. Pumped current as a function of the plunger gate voltage, VPL, and the barrier
right gate voltage, VBR, (left columns) and of the plunger gate voltage and the barrier left gate voltage, VBL, (right columns)
with different amplitudes on BL (a) and BR (b). The frequencies are 200 MHz in (a) and 100 MHz in (b). Magenta (a) and
cyan (b) color indicate pumping regions where I/e f = ±1 within 5%. The parameter values used in (a) are the same as in
Fig. 1(d) except VBL = 0.9 V in left column and VBR = 0.725 V in the right column and ABR = 123 mV in both columns. In
(b) the values are the same as in (a) except VBL = 0.814 V in left column and VBR = 0.85 V in the right column,
ABL = 112 mV and APL = 205 mV in both columns and f BL-PL = 120◦. (c) Maximum plateau length in the plunger dc
voltage as a function of exit barrier amplitude (APL or ABR) extracted from (a) (black squares) and (b) (red circles). The
parameter values are the same as in (a) and (b) for the BL and BR, respectively.
