Dense suspensions of swimming bacteria are known to exhibit collective behaviour arising from
the interplay of steric and hydrodynamic interactions. Unconﬁned suspensions exhibit transient,
recurring vortices and jets, whereas those conﬁned in circular domains may exhibit order in the form
of a spiral vortex. Here we show that conﬁnement into a long and narrow macroscopic ‘racetrack’
geometry stabilises bacterial motion to form a steady unidirectional circulation. This motion is
reproduced in simulations of discrete swimmers that reveal the crucial role that bacteria-driven
ﬂuid ﬂows play in the dynamics. In particular, cells close to the channel wall produce strong ﬂows
which advect cells in the bulk against their swimming direction. We examine in detail the transition
from a disordered state to persistent directed motion as a function of the channel width, and show
that the width at the crossover point is comparable to the typical correlation length of swirls seen in
the unbounded system. Our results shed light on the mechanisms driving the collective behaviour
of bacteria and other active matter systems, and stress the importance of the ubiquitous boundaries
found in natural habitats.

INTRODUCTION

Spreading and survival of populations of bacteria often
depend on their ability to behave collectively: cells aggre-
gate into swarms to seek and migrate towards nutrient-
rich regions [1, 2], organise into bioﬁlms resistant to an-
tibiotics [3, 4], respond to starvation by building fruiting
bodies [5, 6] or opt for cannibalism [7]. In such organisa-
tions, the surrounding environment often plays a major
role, through its chemical composition [2, 3] or geomet-
rical constraints [4, 8]. A complex and fascinating issue
is how the various chemical or mechanical interactions
between the microorganisms and their environment can
guide the intricate dynamics of populations.

Theoretical approaches to this question may utilize
methods from the emerging ﬁeld of ‘active matter’, which
has taken motivation from collective behaviour in suspen-
sions of ﬂagellated bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli and
Bacillus subtilis)
[9–16] as well as those composed of
molecular motors and the ﬁlaments along which they
move [17, 18]. Using discrete [19], continuum [20], and
phenomenological models, this growing ﬁeld of research
has studied self-organisation of populations of interacting
motile organisms or other kinds of active and driven ob-
jects, often giving rise to striking collective behaviours.
Recent studies have predicted that physical conﬁnement
can have a strong impact on the spatio-temporal organi-
zation, and indeed may result in unidirectional ﬂows [21–
26]. Experimental realisations of conﬁned active matter
however remain relatively rare [14–16, 27–30].

The interactions between swimming cells in bacterial
suspensions have two main components: direct steric re-
pulsion and long-range hydrodynamic forces created by
the action of multiple ﬂagella. These interactions lead
to complex collective motion: while direct repulsion be-
tween rod-like bacteria produces local alignment akin to
nematic liquid crystal ordering, hydrodynamic forces can
advect and reorient nearby bacteria [31–33] and power
macroscopic turbulent patterns such as jets and swirls
much faster than an individual bacterium [9–11]. Yet,
these collective structures are not permanent,
instead
they are recurrent and transient.

Previous experiments have been successful

in con-
trolling the bacterial migration through gradients of
chemoattractants [1, 2] or by varying external ﬂow and
environment properties [34]. An alternative that we con-
sider here takes advantage of interfaces, as can be com-
monly encountered in bacterial habitats like soil. Recent
studies have explained how a single microorganism in-
teracts with surfaces [33, 35], yet little has been done to
experimentally study the collective dynamics of motile
bacteria and other types of active matter under conﬁne-
ment [14–16, 27, 30]. Diﬀerent interfaces (ﬂuid, solid)
or conﬁnement topologies (e.g. planar, linear, circular)
could lead to various macroscopic organisations.

Here we describe an experimental setup able to sta-
bilise a dense suspension of Bacillus subtilis into a per-
sistent stream through physical conﬁnement alone. As
shown in ﬁgure 1, bacteria are introduced into an array
of a thin periodic millimetre-long racetracks, allowing for
quantiﬁcation of many realizations of the resultant ﬂow
patterns. Our chief ﬁnding is that there exists a clear
transition from a ‘turbulent’ state to stable circulation
for channel widths (cid:46) 70 µm, or a scale comparable to
correlation length of cell orientations, or equivalently the
diameter of the characteristic swirls seen in eﬀectively

2

10 ml of the suspension was concentrated by centrifu-
gation (1500 g, 10 min), and the pellet was used in the
experiments without further dilution. We estimate the
cell volume fraction to be ∼ 20%.

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchambers were
fabricated with racetracks (20 µm high, 20− 130 µm wide
and more than a 1 mm long, ﬁgure 1(a)), linked by thin
inlets (≈ 10 µm wide). Bacteria were introduced into the
chamber with a syringe and the main inlets were closed
prior to recording to avoid any unwanted motion (visual
inspection veriﬁed the absence of any net ﬂow between
racetracks).

Each preparation was allowed to reach a steady state
over two minutes and videos lasting 5 seconds were ac-
quired with a high-speed camera (Fastcam, Photron, 125
frames/sec) under bright ﬁeld illumination, using a 63×
oil-immersion objective (Zeiss). The velocity ﬁeld of the
bacteria was determined by Particle Image Velocimetry
(using a customised version of mPIV [42]) with no time
averaging (ﬁgure 1(b)). This method yields the proper-
ties of the bacterial motion, not the associated ﬂuid ﬂow.

Measuring the bacterial orientation

Bright ﬁeld images yield only the local velocity ﬁeld
of the bacteria and their rough alignment [14], not their
head-tail orientation. To determine the relationship be-
tween swimming and motion directions we labelled the
ﬂagella and membrane of a subset of the population with
two diﬀerent ﬂuorophores, as described previously [15].
The mutant strain amyE::hag(T209C) DS1919 3610 [43]
was grown in the same conditions as wild-type bacte-
ria and labelled following the protocol of Guttenplan et
al. [43]. 1 ml of the suspension was centrifuged (1000 g,
2 min) and resuspended in 50 µL of Phosphate Buﬀered
Saline (PBS) containing 5 µg/mL Alexa Fluor 488 C5
Maleimide (Molecular Probes) and incubated at room
temperature for 5 minutes. This ﬂuorophore reacts with
the cysteine added to the ﬂagella protein ﬂagellin (gene
hag). Bacteria were then washed in 1 mL PBS and resus-
pended in PBS containing 5 µg/mL FM 4-64 (Molecular
Probes). This ﬂuorophore incorporates itself into lipid
bilayers and labels cell membranes. The excess of ﬂu-
orophore was removed in a ﬁnal wash and the bacteria
were resuspended into 50 µl PBS. A fraction of the la-
belled mutants was then gently mixed with unlabelled
wild-type bacteria. Cells cannot swim in PBS, which
lacks a carbon source, but recover their initial motility
once transferred into Terriﬁc Broth.

Images were acquired on a spinning disc confocal mi-
croscope (Zeiss Axio Observer Z1, camera Photometrics
Evolve 512 Delta) at 6 fps. Both ﬂuorophores were ex-
cited with a 488 nm laser and the emission was ﬁltered
with a GFP ﬁlter (barrier ﬁlter 500 − 550 nm, Zeiss) for

unbounded suspensions [9, 10, 36]. Numerical studies of
a discrete model of swimmers which incorporates both
steric and hydrodynamic interactions between the cells
reveal that the suspension motion is dominated by the
bacteria-driven ﬂuid stream. In particular, cells close to
the bounding walls create a strong ﬂuid ﬂow which ad-
vects the cells in the bulk of the channel against their
swimming direction in a manner similar to that seen in
circular drops of suspension [14, 15]. Analysis of the
suspension kinetics sheds light on the mechanism that
drives bacterial collective behaviour. This organisation
shows strong connections with previous work on bacterial
pumping in microﬂuidic chambers [37] and cell swimming
or alignment against a shear ﬂuid ﬂow [34, 38–41].

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Experiments

Dense suspension of motile B. subtilis (wild-type,
strain 168) were prepared from an overnight culture,
diluted 200-fold into fresh Terriﬁc Broth (TB, Sigma)
and incubated at 35◦C for ≈ 5h. When the bacteria
reached a high motility fraction ( > 90% motile cells),

Alexa Fluor 488 C5 Maleimide and DsRed ﬁlter (barrier
ﬁlter 570 − 640 nm, Zeiss) for FM 4-64. We took a se-
quence of three images: membrane (false coloured red),
ﬂagella (false coloured green) and again membrane (false
coloured blue, ﬁgure 6) and measured the bacterial mo-
tion from the membrane displacement between the ﬁrst
and last image. We then deduced the orientation of the
cell (its swimming direction) from the bundling of the
ﬂagella (at the rear of the cell) and from the average
position of the membrane relative to this bundle.

Modelling and Simulations

We used numerical simulations, adapted from a recent
method [15], to understand the self-organisation of the
suspension. Bacteria are represented as motile ellipses,
subject to steric and hydrodynamic interactions and con-
ﬁned into a periodic channel. Each swimmer generates
a dipolar “pusher”-ﬂow ﬁeld and is aﬀected by the ﬂuid
ﬂow disturbances created by the other swimmers.

We use a 2D domain with periodic boundaries of length
L and width 2w where y = 0, w are the channel walls.
Each swimmer is modelled as an ellipse of length (cid:96) =
1, width (cid:96)/4, described by its centre of mass Xi and
orientation Pi. Xi and Pi are randomly initiated and
follow the dynamics [15, 44]:

Equation (1) describes self-propulsion with constant
speed (chosen as U0 = 1) along the cell direction Pi, ad-
vection by the ﬂuid velocity v interpolated at the swim-
mer position, and pairwise steric repulsion with force Fe

i + m⊥(I− PiPT
between swimmers. Here, Ξ = m||PiPT

with the mobility parameters m⊥=2m|| ≈ 2. The
ﬁrst term of equation (2) is Jeﬀery’s equation and de-
scribes rotation of the particle by the ﬂuid ﬂow v with
2E = ∇v + ∇vT , 2W = ∇v − ∇vT ; γ ≈ 0.9 for el-
lipses with aspect ratio 4. The last term of equation (2)
describes swimmer rotation due to torques from steric
interactions with neighbours with k ≈ 5. The purely re-
pulsive steric forces Fe
ij between swim-
mers are obtained using the method described by Con-
stanzo et al.[45]. Each swimmer is discretized into nb = 4
beads that interact with other swimmers through a soft
capped Lennard-Jones potential [15]. This potential al-
lows some overlaps but does not over-restrict the time-
stepping. Noise terms are not included in the dynamics.
To approximate the boundary condition at y = 0, w,
we use a system of images. For each swimmer i in

([0, L], [−w, w]) which is assumed bi-periodic. Using the
mirror domain in the y-direction for solving equation 3
is a computationally eﬃcient way to approximate the ef-
fects of the PDMS interface as a no-stress boundary con-
dition (ﬁgure 2). Note that to guarantee a no-slip bound-
ary condition for the ﬂuid ﬂow, other methods, e.g. [19]
are more appropriate, but require higher computational
power for many swimmer simulations.

The free parameters in the simulations are the swim-
mer length (cid:96) := 1, its shape parameter, its swimming
speed U0 := 1, the stresslet strength σ := −1 which de-
termines the magnitude of the generated ﬂuid ﬂows, as
well as the channel dimensions. We note that we did
not match these with the experimental values, hence the
comparisons between the results are qualitative and not
quantitative.

RESULTS

Conﬁnement stabilises a bacterial stream

We inject a dense suspension of swimming B. subtilis
into 20 µm high racetracks. When conﬁnement is strong
enough, the turbulent collective motion is stabilised and
forms a persistent stream (ﬁgure 1). This circulation is
stable for tens of minutes until bacteria stop swimming
due to oxygen depletion.

Experimental points are averaged over at least ﬁve movies, recorded on at least two diﬀerent days, simulations are averaged
over a time 5U0/(cid:96). ∞: an unconﬁned quasi-2D chamber.

We quantify the overall motion by measuring the nor-

malised net ﬂow:

Φ =

(4)

where u is the bacterial ﬂow as measured by PIV, ex the
unit vector along the channel main direction (ﬁgure 1(b))
and summing over all PIV sub-windows inside the chan-
nel and over ≈ 70 frames of a 5 seconds long movie. We
observed CW and CCW circulation with equal probabil-
ity and therefore study the absolute value of Φ. Φ = 1
indicates a purely longitudinal ﬂow (e.g. u = (cid:107)u(cid:107)ex) and
Φ = 0 indicates a globally stationary suspension.

Figure 3 shows a clear dependence of the net ﬂow Φ
on the channel width w: while the suspension exhibits a
strong circulation (Φ > 0.7) for thin chambers, it quickly
transitions into a stationary turbulent state (Φ < 0.2)
around w∗

exp = 70 µm.

We compared these results with simulations in a 2D
periodic channel domain, to mimic the straight section
of the racetracks (ﬁgure 1(b)). Ellipsoid swimmers, sub-
ject to both steric and hydrodynamic interactions, self-
organise into a stream similar to the observed experimen-
tal motion, as seen in ﬁgure 5(d). We computed the net
ﬂow Φ, this time summing over bulk swimmers only. We
found the same qualitative behaviour with strong circu-
lation only for thin channels w < w∗
sim = 17(cid:96) (where (cid:96) is
the swimmer length).

Figure 3 shows that the transition from a stable stream
to an overall stationary state can be matched between
experiments and simulation (w∗
sim) by choosing
(cid:96) = 4 µm. Note that other outcomes, e.g. ﬂow strength,
are not necessarily matched.

Bacterial ﬂow patterns under conﬁnement

In unconﬁned environments, dense bacterial suspen-
sions exhibit typical patterns of jets and swirls [10–13].
PDMS interfaces in racetracks change this pattern in or-
der to allow for the net circulation. We now study the
pattern stabilisation, through the averaged ﬂow proﬁle,
depending on the channel width. If the ﬂow were driven
by a pressure gradient, a passive Newtonian ﬂuid would
produce a parabolic or pump ﬂow [46]. Yet bacteria col-
lectively generate irregular ﬂow patterns.

We measure the proﬁle or cross section of the ﬂow pat-

terns, averaged over time and space:

F (y) = (cid:104)u(x, y, t) · ex(cid:105)(x,t) ,

(5)

where the direction of ex is chosen such that F (y) is on
average positive. Figure 4(a) shows diﬀerent behaviours
depending on the channel width w.
For the thinnest channels (w ≈ 35 µm) the ﬂow is di-
rected parallel to the channel length and F takes a quasi-
parabolic proﬁle. F then ﬂattens for w ≈ 45 µm and
splits into two peaks for w ≈ 55 µm. At such width,
small swirls start to emerge but are not strong enough to
alter the circulation. When the width reaches the critical
value w > w∗
exp = 70 µm, the suspension is able to form
full vortices. F takes a sinusoidal form such that bac-
teria on each side move in opposite directions and most
vortices circulate in the same direction (CCW in ﬁgure
4 (a)). For wider racetrack (w ≈ 100 µm) the suspension
recovers its quasi-turbulent state and F exhibits several
oscillations. In this last case, if we averaged over a longer
period of time, the resulting proﬁle should come to zero.
For channels between 50 and 70 µm in width, we ob-
serve that the proﬁle F displays two maximum values, at

order to measure this length for diﬀerent widths, we ﬁt F

where A1 and A2 are the amplitude of each function and
β is a parameters setting the shape of the distribution.
Each beta function is the symmetric of the other except
beta(w − y). The beta
f (2)
for the amplitude: f (1)
distribution functions are merely used for simplicity and
have no physical connection to the bacterial suspensions.
We found that Ff it correctly describes the ﬂow proﬁles
until w ≈ 75 µm (ﬁgure 4(a)). For w ≈ 35 µm, the two
beta functions are almost identically and mostly overlap.
They then come apart to form a double-peaked func-
tion (w ≈ 55 µm) which then becomes anti-correlated
(A1A2 < 0) for w ≈ 75 µm. For the largest racetrack,
Ff it only captures the ﬁrst and last peaks but not the
bulk behaviour.

We then measure the distance ym at which f (1)
beta
reaches its maximum (represented as a thin line on ﬁg-
ure 4(b)). Figure 4(d) shows that ym does not depend on
the racetrack width: the ﬂow proﬁle is simply the sum
of two beta functions, of width-independent shape, and
that move apart as the channels widen, suggesting that
the circulation is driven by bacteria close to the wall.

Simulations show a similar behaviour, with parabolic
(w = 6(cid:96)), ﬂattened (w = 9(cid:96)), double-peaked (w = 15(cid:96))
and sinusoidal proﬁles (w = 19(cid:96), ﬁgure 4(b)). The only
signiﬁcant diﬀerence lies in the bacteria motion at the
boundary: simulations reveal that these swimmers move
against the bulk circulation: Fsimu(0)· Fsimu(3(cid:96)) < 0. We
also observed experimentally that bacteria at interfaces
swim against the bulk circulation, but PIV measurements
could not catch this feature.

Both the swimmer motion at the boundary and the
ﬂow proﬁle ﬁtting suggest that bacteria close to the wall
play an important role in the suspension ordering.

Boundaries and ﬂuid ﬂow drive the bacterial

circulation

We turn to simulations to understand how boundaries
aﬀect the bacteria organisation and in particular to ﬁnd
the causes of the bulk circulation as observed in exper-
iments. We consider diﬀerent scenarios: dilute or dense
suspensions, with or without hydrodynamic interactions.
The examples in ﬁgure 5 have a channel width of w = 6(cid:96).
We ﬁrst neglect hydrodynamics and consider swimmers
interacting between themselves and with the boundary
through direct steric repulsions only. In both dilute and

6

dense cases (ﬁgure 5(a),(b)), swimmers aggregate at the
boundary to form packs or hedgehog-like clusters, as pre-
viously observed [45, 47]. Due to their elongated shape,
swimmers at the boundary exhibit a local nematic align-
ment, with heads facing the interface, and slowly move
alongside it. Cells in the bulk jam in clusters with little
organisation discernible.

We next include ﬂuid ﬂows generated by bacteria. In
dilute suspensions, as shown in ﬁgure 5(c), swimmers ag-
gregate at the boundary and form packed layers similar
to the steric-only case. However they generate a strong
ﬂuid stream, against their swimming direction.
If the
channel width is suﬃciently small, the ﬂuid reorients the
opposite layer such that swimmers on each channel side
move in the same direction. This packing and organisa-
tion is not observed experimentally at low densities, most
probably because 2D simulations do not allow for over-
lap whereas bacteria in 20 µm deep racetracks can easily
swim and roll-over over one-another.

When the density is further increased (ﬁgure 5(d)), the
same mechanism is at work: the two boundary-bound
layers of swimmers drive a strong ﬂuid ﬂow, reorienting
and advecting the cells that now ﬁll up the centre of
the channel. Bulk swimmers have a biased orientation
against this ﬂow but do not swim fast enough to over-
come the advection. They are thus transported against
the boundary layers giving rise to a macroscopic bulk cir-
culation similar to the experimental observations (ﬁgure
1(b)).

The simulations also clarify the proﬁle shapes (ﬁgure
4). Sketches of the swimmers, drawn at the channel walls
in ﬁgure 4(c), indicate their swimming orientation and
the direction of the ﬂuid ﬂow they push back. This ﬂow
advects over a distance ∼ ym the cells in the bulk, whose
overall collective motion can be ﬁtted with the double
beta function proﬁles.

Experimentally, bacteria can ﬂow over 60 µm/s, sig-
niﬁcantly faster than the single cell swimming speed of
10 µm/s. This high velocity suggests that the bulk bac-
terial motion is indeed dominated by ﬂuid advection.

To verify the organisation predicted by simulations,
we track ﬂuorescently labelled bacteria (ﬁgure 6). We
deduced the cell orientation from the relative position
of the body and ﬂagella and the overall motion from
the body displacement. We found the same biased ori-
entation against the ﬂow in the bulk of thin channels
(w < w∗ = 70 µm): out of the 24 labelled bacteria
tracked, 4 were oriented along the ey direction, 4 were
swimming with the ﬂow and 16 were swimming against
the ﬂow (oriented against their overall motion direction).
Cells at the surface had a forward motion, against the
bulk circulation, conﬁrming the organisation found in
simulations.

Spatial and temporal variations in bacterial ﬂow

patterns

Our current model - edge bacteria driving the bulk ﬂow
through hydrodynamic interactions - explains the overall
circulation. As described earlier, bacteria in thin race-
tracks also form partial and travelling swirls, reminiscent
of the unconﬁned turbulent state. We study this ﬂow
pattern by computing both the correlation lengths and
the motion of swirls.

We ﬁrst compute the spatial correlation from which we

extract two characteristic lengths: the oscillation period
Lc and the amplitude decay length Le. To do so, we take
advantage of the lateral conﬁnement and modify the clas-
sical two-point velocity correlation function to focus on
the variation of the orthogonal ﬂow uy along the channel
length ex:

(cid:80) uy(x, y, t) · uy(x + s, y, t)

windows in the bulk of a channel of a full 5 second long
movie. C exhibits decaying oscillations (ﬁgure 7(b)), a
behaviour that was observed in previous work [48] but,
to our knowledge, has not been fully analysed.

Two main approaches have been used to compute the
correlation length: either ﬁtting with a decaying expo-
nential [11, 13] or taking the distance at which C reaches
zero or its ﬁrst minimum [47]. Instead we ﬁt C with a
function that describes the decay and the oscillations:

(cid:105) · cos(2πs/Lc),

Even though we also do observe a wave pattern in sim-
ulations, the correlation function mostly reﬂects the do-
main periodicity.

The bacterial ﬂow patterns then are not static: while
the bacteria stream in the channel, the partial swirls they
generate travel as well. To quantify this eﬀect we mea-
sure the ﬂow pattern motion by the spatial correlation
between two time points:

Figure 7(a) shows that both Le and Lc increase with
the racetrack width and reach a plateau around w ≈

streaming ceases and the suspension is able to form full

Illustration of the bacterial organization in racetracks of varying width.

DISCUSSION

We have shown that conﬁning a dense bacterial
suspension into a thin periodic racetrack leads to the
spontaneous formation of a stable circulation along it.
A similar setup has been previously used to study two
diﬀerent active matter systems: marching locusts [49]
and rolling colloidal particles [27]. As for bacteria,
collective colloid motion is driven by hydrodynamic
interactions, but can result in the formation of travelling
waves and density shocks while the bacterial suspension
always appears spatially homogeneous.

To understand how the suspension self-organises in
racetracks, we have measured the net ﬂow, ﬂow corre-
lation and proﬁle depending on the channel width. We
reproduced these results with simulations, revealing the
ﬂuid ﬂows generated by the bacteria. Combining these
diﬀerent approaches, we draw a picture in Figure 8 of how
bacterial motion, hydrodynamic interactions and conﬁne-
ment drive the macroscopic circulation.

Independently of the channel size, bacteria at the
PDMS surface move along a given direction while
propelling the ﬂuid in the opposite direction, over a
distance ym ≈ 14 µm. This ﬂuid ﬂow, much faster
than the single cell’s swimming speed, reorients and
advects cells in the suspension. As a result bulk bacteria
are transported against their swimming orientation
in a backward motion.
Diﬀerent behaviours then
arise for varying channel widths. For thin channels
(w < w∗ = 70 µm) the ﬂuid ﬂow on one side reaches the
opposite interface and reorients the bacteria such that
all cells at the diﬀerent surfaces move in the opposite
direction to the bulk circulation, and give rise to the
parabolic, ﬂat and double-peaked proﬁles (ﬁgure 8).
Inside the channel, conﬁnement restricts the turbulent
bacterial motion such that bacteria form partial swirls
that mostly travel with the bacterial stream, without
aﬀecting the overall circulation.
For intermediate
channel widths (70 < w < 90 µm) the suspension forms

full vortices, showing no net circulation (Φ < 0.2). Yet
the coordination between opposite sides is not lost but
now appears to be anti-correlated (as shown in the
sinusoidal ﬂow proﬁles, ﬁgure 8). In particular, vortices
in the channels have a preferred rotation direction,
either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the
orientation of the bacteria at the interface. For even
larger channels, w > 90 µm, the suspension recovers its
unconﬁned turbulent state and no correlation is observed
between opposite PDMS walls. However it still remains
length-scale of w∗ = 70 µm
unclear how the critical
of the vortical macroscopic structures in the collective
motion of this bacterium is selected.

Some continuum models of active matter in conﬁne-
ment have previously predicted unidirectional ﬂow or net
circulation [21–25]. Ravnik et al. [24] found that the bac-
terial ﬂow in a pipe has a weak (∼ 1%) component along
the y and z directions, but with vortex patterns quite dif-
ferent from the wave-like stream we observe here. Field-
ing et al.[22] considered 2D channels of varying width but
observed circulation for channels wider than the suspen-
sion vortex size, in contradiction with our net ﬂow mea-
surements (ﬁgure 3). Neef and Kruse [25] consider ac-
tive polar ﬂuids in annular domains and see surprisingly
similar patterns to ours such as unidirectional stream-
ing, moving or stationary vortices for increasing channel
widths in the extensile particle case. Many of the dif-
ferences between these theoretical predictions may arise
from the diﬃculty of setting realistic boundary condi-
tions and on including both the swimmer-generated ﬂuid
ﬂow and bacterial motion in such continuum models.

Despite many previous simulation studies on micro-
swimmers in channels or between plates, this speciﬁc col-
lective behaviour we report here has not been observed
before in experiments or simulations. Menzel [50] per-
formed simulations of self-propelled particles using a Vic-
sek model with aligning interactions, no hydrodynamics,
and observed collective migration along the channel in
the form of particle clusters and lanes. Costanzo et al.[45]

simulated elongated swimmers in a periodic channel, in-
teracting directly and through dipolar-generated ﬂuid
ﬂows, but did not observe any collective behaviour and
net circulation when external ﬂow was not imposed. One
possible explanation is that they computed the hydrody-
namic interactions without taking into account bound-
aries. Here we include mirror images to approximate the
PDMS interface which enhances the bulk ﬂuid stream.
These small diﬀerences between these studies highlight
the key roles played not only by the surfaces and the
cell-driven ﬂows arising from them but also of the elon-
gated particle shapes that are needed for the swimmers
orienting and ordering alongside each-other at the wall.
Yet, the behaviour of bacteria in racetracks is reminis-
cent of some previous experiments and can be understood
as a combination of insights deriving from them. Swim-
ming bacteria glued to a surface can coordinate their ori-
entations and create a net ﬂow far from the wall. Darn-
ton et al.[51] used this eﬀect to propel small objects while
Kim et al.[37] used it to turn a microﬂuidic channel into
a bacteria-powered pump. This phenomenon is qualita-
tively similar to what we observed in the racetracks, ex-
cept here the bacteria are free and swimming along the
surface while creating ﬂuid ﬂow in the bulk. Other stud-
ies have shown that the motion of swimmers in micro-
channels is aﬀected by an external shear ﬂow [34, 38–41].
In particular, swimmers there are biased to swim against
the ﬂow as we also observed in simulations and conﬁrmed
with ﬂuorescence labelling. Finally, the self-organisation
in racetracks is comparable to what was observed when
bacteria were conﬁned in ﬂattened drops: the bacteria
at the interface move in opposite direction to the bulk,
which itself is advected by the ﬂuid [14, 15]. In both ex-
periments (drops and racetracks), we found that the net
circulation breaks down around 70 µm, the typical size of
swirls in unconﬁned chambers [36] and also the critical
diameter of circular drops below which bacterial motion
stabilizes into one vortex [14].

Microﬂuidic channels have been used previously to
study the behaviour of micro-swimmers, notably to
sort bacteria E. coli by length [52] or direct spermato-
zoa [53, 54] by making use of ratcheting channels. The
curves of the micro-channels in those cases are designed
to guide the swimmers in one speciﬁed direction. Here we
used straight walls, such that the spontaneously emerg-
ing stream can occur in either direction with equal prob-
ability. As an extension of our work, one could design
a circular channel with ratcheted surfaces to direct the
suspension stream in a chosen left or right direction.

conﬁnement

Dense bacterial suspensions have been extensively
studied without
self-
organisation presents new challenges and surprises. The
experiments presented here not only give insight into the
eﬀect of conﬁnement but also help in understanding the
general behaviour of such suspensions. In particular, we
have shown that the correlation function could be anal-

and yet

their

10

ysed as two parts: an oscillating and a decaying term. To
our knowledge, other studies have described only one of
the two, ﬁtting the vortex size or the persistence length.
Here conﬁnement into a racetrack stabilises the suspen-
sion to form a more regular pattern, emphasising this
structure. With the added insight of our work, some pre-
vious results could be reinterpreted: for example, Gache-
lin et al.[13] have shown the persistence length of an E.
coli suspension to increase with the density, which trans-
lates to a slower decay of the correlation function C(s)
at higher densities. However the ﬁrst zero of the C(s)
occurred, over all their measurements, at the constant
value s∗ ≈ 55 µm, indicating that the swirl size does not
depend on the concentration but is an intrinsic length
scale associated with the swimming bacteria.

Finally, this conﬁnement setup opens new avenues for
the study of collective behaviours in more complex natu-
ral or artiﬁcial environments, that could include networks
of channels, various solid or ﬂuid interfaces, and chemical
attractants. Notably, Wilking et al. showed B. subtilis
bioﬁlms to form channels, on average 90 µm in diame-
ter [4], comparable with our critical width w∗ ≈ 70 µm.
Although the primary role of these channels is to trans-
port liquid and nutrients, they could also direct the mi-
gration of single or groups of swimming bacteria. A bet-
ter understanding of the interactions and how they drive
phenomena in these systems can guide us into better con-
trol of collective bacterial behaviour and possible use in
technological applications.
