Abstract

Consider a network D of pipes which have to be cleaned using some
cleaning agents, called brushes, assigned to some vertices. The minimum
number of brushes required for cleaning the network D is called its brush
number. The tattooing of a simple connected directed graph D is a particular
type of the cleaning in which an arc are coloured by the colour of the colour-
brush transiting it and the tattoo number of D is a corresponding derivative of
brush numbers in it. Tattooing along an out-arc of a vertex v may proceed if a
minimum set of colour-brushes is allocated (primary colours) or combined with
those which have arrived (including colour blends) together with mutation of
permissible new colour blends, has cardinality greater than or equal to d+
G(v).

colouring concepts, please see [6, 9]. Unless mentioned otherwise, all graphs and
digraphs considered in this paper are simple, ﬁnite, connected and non-trivial.

As a combination of graph searching problems (see [14, 15]) and chip ﬁring
problems (see [1]), a graph cleaning model was introduced in [11], which can be
explained as follows. Consider a network D of pipes that have to be periodically
cleaned. For this purpose, we can use some cleaning agents called brushes, assigned
to some vertices of D. When vertex is cleaned, a brush must travel down each
contaminated edge. When a brush traverse an edge, that edge is said to be cleaned
and a graph G is considered to be cleaned when every edge of G has been cleaned.
Some important and interesting studies on the brush number br(G) of certain
graphs have been done (For some of these studies, see [10, 12, 13]). In the cleaning
models, the problem is initially set in such a way that all edges of a simple connected
undirected graph G are dirty. A ﬁnite number of brushes, βG(v) ≥ 0 is allocated
to each vertex v ∈ V (G). Sequentially, any vertex v, which has βG(v) brushes
allocated to it, may clean the vertex itself and send exactly one brush along a dirty
edge and in doing so allocate an additional brush to the corresponding adjacent
vertex (neighbour). The reduced graph G(cid:48) = G − vu, ∀ vu ∈ E(G), βG(v) ≥ d(v) is
considered for the next iterative cleansing step. It is to be noted that a neighbour
of the vertex v in G, say u, now have βG(cid:48)(u) = βG(u) + 1 brushes.

Clearly, for any simple connected undirected graph G the ﬁrst step of cleaning
begin if and only if the number of brushes allocated to a vertex v is greater than
or equal to the degree of v; that is, βG(v) = d(v). Then, the minimum number of
brushes that is required to commence the ﬁrst step of cleaning is βG(u) = d(u) =
δ(G); u ∈ V (G). Also, note that the above mentioned condition does not guarantee
that the graph will be cleaned, but just assures at least the occurrence of the ﬁrst
step of cleaning only.

If some orientation of the edges of a simple connected graph G is given, then
G is a directed graph and brushes may only clean along an out-arc from a vertex.
Cleaning may initiate from a vertex v if and only if βG(v) ≥ d+
G(v) = 0.
The sequence in which vertices sequentially initiate cleaning is called the cleaning
sequence with respect to the orientation αi(G). The minimum number of brushes to
be allocated to clean a graph for a given orientation αi(G) is denoted bαi
r (G). If an
r (G) = ∞.
orientation αi(G) renders cleaning of the graph unrealisable, deﬁne bαi

G(v) and d−

An orientation αi(G) for which bαi

r (G) is a minimum over all possible orientations
of G is called an optimal orientation of G with respect to that cleaning model. This
minimum number of brushes is called the brush number of the graph G, denoted by
br(G). It is conventional to use br(Nn) = n, where Nn is the null graph (edgeless
graph) of order n.

If  denotes the size of the graph G, then G can have 2 orientations and hence
an optimal orientation of G need not be a unique one. Hence, we can deﬁne the
collection of orientations of G, denoted by A, can be deﬁned as A = {αi(G) :
αi is an orientation of G}.

Motivated by various studies on brush number on graphs, in this paper, we now
introduce certain new colouring parameters derived from the brush number of graphs
and study some important and interesting properties of these parameters.

2 Tattooing of Graphs

In all studies on brush number of graphs, brushes are considered to be identical
objects and when cleaning is initiated from a vertex v, a particular brush can clean
along any out-arc at random. There is no preferred condition set on the choice of
an out-arc. In the following study of tattooing of graphs, we use the property of
colouring. The tattooing of a simple connected directed graph D is a particular type
of the cleaning in which an arc will be coloured by the colour of the colour-brush
transiting it and the tattoo number of the directed graph D is a corresponding
derivative of brush numbers in it. Initial colours will be called primary colours and
primary colours will be allowed to blend into additional colour blends.

The motivation for this mathematical model lies in various observations that
many dynamical systems propagate through the system (considered to be a network
or graph) upon reaching a threshold value. Certain other examples are electrical
potential in cloud-earth systems to allow electrical arcing to create lightning and the
associated sound of thunder. Some viruses or anti-viruses be it, biological or virtual,
have a period of incubation to allow for either growth in numbers or mutation
before propagation. It is common that pressure systems function on the diﬀusion of
peak pressures through pressure valves. Perhaps the most historical example is the
creation of our universe with the ﬁrst event, called the Big Bang.

Consider a set of colour-brushes C = {ci : 1 ≤ i ≤ n; n ∈ N}. Set C represents
the primary colours and when the context is clear, referred to as primary colour-
brushes or simply colour-brushes. Let the initial allocation (Step t = 0 of the
tattooing process), say s, s ≥ 0, of primary colours to a vertex v be the set
Xt=0(v) = {ci : i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , s; s ∈ N}. This allocation is allowed to mutate (which
is also called blending) to include all possible primary blends of colour-brushes.
Hence, this allocation is the set P0(Xt=0(v)) of all non-empty subsets of (Xt=0(v)).
A primary colour blend is the colour blend of at least two distinct primary
colours. Primary colour blends may not mutate into secondary blends. During the
ith-step of tattooing a number of identical primary colour-brushes or primary colour
blends may arrive at a vertex v. Following from set theory repetition is not allowed.
Such a set is reduced to a set of distinct primary colours or colour blends. Obviously,
{c1, c2, c3 . . . , cs}s=0 = ∅. In this paper, we now write {ci,j,k,...,(cid:96)} to shortly represent
{ci, cj, ck . . . , c(cid:96)}.
Let us now introduce the notion of the tattoo power set of the set of colours as
follows.

4

Tattooing and the Tattoo Number of Graphs

Deﬁnition 2.1. At the ith-step, i ≥ 0, the tattoo power set of Xt=i(v) is deﬁned to
be

(i) P∗(Xt=i(v)) = P0({c1, c2, c3, . . . , cs}) or ∅ (typically, but not exclusively at

0th-step), or

(ii) P∗(Xt=i(v)) = P0({ci, cj, ck, . . . ct}), because only primary colour-brushes have

arrived, or

(iii) P∗(Xt=i(v)) = P0({ci, cj, ck, . . . ct}∪{primary colour blends ∈ P∗

0 (Xt=i−1(u)),

(u, v) ∈ A(G)}, or

Example 2.1.

(iv) P∗(Xt=i(v)) = {primary colour blends ∈ P∗

0 (Xt=i−1(u)), (u, v) ∈ A(G)} only.
(i) Let Xt=i(v) = {c1, c2, c3}. Then, we have P0(Xt=i(v)) =
{{c1},{c2},{c3},{c1, c2},{c1, c3},{c2, c3},{c1, c2, c3}}. Hence, P∗(Xt=i(v)) =
P0(Xt=i(v)).

(ii) Assume that during a step the colour-brushes {ci, ci, ci, ck, ck, cs,t,(cid:96)} arrive at
vertex v. First, consider P∗
0 ({ci, ci, ci, ck, ck, cs,t,(cid:96)}) = P0({ci, ck} ∪ {cs,t,(cid:96)}) =
{{ci},{ck},{ci, ck},{cs,t,(cid:96)}} to decide whether suﬃcient colour-brushes are
available to proceed tattooing. If not suﬃcient, consider the set {ci, ck}∪{cs,t,(cid:96)}
and determine the minimum addition distinct primary colours with smallest
subscripts needed. If for example, an additional primary colour cm is needed,
consider the set {cm, ci, ck} ∪ {cs,t,(cid:96)}. Now consider the new tattoo power set
P∗
0 (Xt=i(v)) = {{ci},{ck},{cm},{ci, cm},{ci, ck},{ck, cm},{ci, ck, cm},{cs,t,(cid:96)}}.

Example 2.2. If the vertex v is initially allocated with the colour-brushes Xt=0(v) =
{c1, c2}, then before tattooing begins the mapping {c1, c2} (cid:55)→ P∗
0 (Xt=0(v)) =
{{c1},{c2},{c1, c2}} represents the permissible mutation. Thereafter, the map-
ping {{c1},{c2},{c1, c2}} (cid:55)→ {c1, c2, c1,2} represents the colour-brushes which may
proceed with tattooing.

Example 2.3. Assume during the ith-step of tattooing a vertex v has been al-
located the colour-brushes Xt=i(v) = {c1, c2, ci, ct,s...(cid:96)}. Then before tattooing
begins in the (i + 1)th-step the mapping {c1, c2, ci, ct,s...(cid:96)} (cid:55)→ P∗
0 (Xt=i+1(v)) =
{{c1},{c2},{ci},{c1, c2},{c1, ci},{c2, ci},{c1, c2, ci},{ct,s...(cid:96)} (cid:55)→ {c1, c2, ci, c1,2, c1,i,
c2,i, c1,2,i, ct,s...(cid:96)} represents the permissible colour-brushes.

We now introduce some more new parameters with respect to the tattooing of

given graphs as follows.

Deﬁnition 2.2. The tattoo label of an arc ai, denoted l(ai), is deﬁned to be the
ordered subscript(s) of either the primary colour-brush or the blended colour-brush
tattooing along the arc. Furthermore, the sum of the entries of l(ai) is denoted
lΣ(ai).

Deﬁnition 2.3. The random tattoo number of a simple connected randomly directed
graph G having orientation αi(G),which belongs to the 2|E(G)| possible orientations,
denoted by τ αi(G), is the minimum number of times primary colour-brushes are
allocated to vertices of G to iteratively tattoo along all arcs of G. The count excludes
the transition of a primary colour-brush from one vertex to another.

Deﬁnition 2.4. The tattoo number of a simple connected graph G denoted τ (G) is
deﬁned to be τ (G) = min{τ αi(G) : ∀ αi(G)}}.
Example 2.4. Consider the directed path Pn = v1a1v2a2v3a3 . . . vn−1an−1vn, the
directed cycle Cn = v1a1v2a2v3a3 . . . vn−1an−1vn + (v1, vn).

(i) Let the initial colour-brush allocation of the directed path Pn be v1 (cid:55)→
{c1}, v2 (cid:55)→ ∅, v3 (cid:55)→ ∅ . . . vn (cid:55)→ ∅. Clearly, iterative tattooing of all arcs is
possible hence, τ (Pn) = 1 with l(a1) = l(a2) = . . . = l(an−1) = (1).

(ii) Let the initial colour-brush allocation of the directed cycle Cn be v1 (cid:55)→
{c1, c2}, v2 (cid:55)→ ∅, v3 (cid:55)→ ∅ . . . vn (cid:55)→ ∅. After mutation we have v1 (cid:55)→ {{c1},{c2},
{c1, c2}}, v2 (cid:55)→ ∅, v3 (cid:55)→ ∅ . . . vn (cid:55)→ ∅. Clearly, tattooing is possible in six
diﬀerent ways.

Either:

(a) c1 tattoo along a1, a2, . . . , an−1 and c2 tattoo along (v1, vn) with l(a1) = l(a2) =

. . . = l(an) = (1) and l((v1, vn)) = (2) or vice versa, or

(b) c1 tattoo along a1, a2, . . . , an−1 and c1,2 tattoo along (v1, vn) with l(a1) =

l(a2) = . . . = l(an) = (1) and l((v1, vn)) = (1, 2) or vice versa, or

(c) c2 tattoo along a1, a2, . . . , an−1 and c1,2 tattoo along (v1, vn) with l(a1) =

l(a2) = . . . = l(an) = (2) and l((v1, vn)) = (1, 2) or vice versa.

Since P∗

0 ({c1}) = {c1}, the initial allocation of one colour-brush to a vertex will

not be suﬃcient and therefore, we have τ (Cn) = 2.

We now have a perhaps, obvious but important result for an undirected graph G.

Lemma 2.1. Consider a simple connected undirected graph G. Over all orientations
αi of a graph G, we have τ (G) = min{τ αi(G)} ≤ br(G).
Proof. As |P∗
0 (Xt=i(v))| ≥ d+(v);∀ v, the proof follows immediately as an analogue
the deﬁnition of cleaning processes and the deﬁnition of the brush numbers provided
in [13].

The next result is intuitively obvious, but requires a rigorous formal proof.

Theorem 2.2. Let the graph G of order n have an optimal orientation in respect of
brush cleaning. If ki ≥ 0 brushes were initially allocated to vertex vi ∈ V (G) to realise
br(G), then at most a set Xs(vi) of s colour-brushes such that |P∗
0 (Xs(vi))| ≥ ki are
required at v to realise min{τ (G)}.

6

Tattooing and the Tattoo Number of Graphs

Proof. Consider a graph G of order n with vertices vi; i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n. Let the
tattooing propagate on the time line t = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , (cid:96). At t = 0, allocate to
all vertices vi, d−(vi) = 0, i ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . . , n} an initial minimum set Xt=0(vi)
of colour-brushes such that |P∗
0 (Xt=0(vi))| is greater than or equal to the initial
number ki of brushes allocated for brush cleaning. Clearly, |Xt=0(vi)| ≤ ki and
0 (Xt=0(vi))| ≥ d+(vi) hence, tattooing from these vertices may propagate. Remove
|P∗
these vertices vi together with the out-arcs that have been tattooed. Label this
reduced graph G(cid:48). If E(G(cid:48)) = ∅, tattooing is complete. Else, consider all vertices
vj ∈ V (G(cid:48)), d−(vj) = 0, d+(vj) > 0. Since {c(cid:96)} = c(cid:96) we have to consider three cases
similar to those in Deﬁnition 2.1.
Case (i): Assume Xt=1(vj) = {ci, cj, ck, . . . , cs}, with i, j, k, . . . , s with duplica-
0 (Xt=1(vj))| ≥ d+(vj) no additional colour-brushes are required. So far, the
If |P∗
tattooing count is less than or equal to the brushing count. Tattooing may proceed
at t = 1.
If |P∗
0 (Xt=1(vj))| < d+(vj), then add the minimum additional distinct primary

t=1(vj))| is
Case (ii): Assume Xt=1(vj) = {ci, cj, ck, . . . , cs} ∪ {primary colour blends}, with

for Case (i).

Clearly, the cardinality of the set with additional colour-brushes, |P∗

t=1(vj) such that |P∗

tion deleted.

0 (X(cid:48)

0 (X(cid:48)

If |P∗

Case (iii) Assume Xt=1(vj) is the set of all primary colour blends without
0 (Xt=1(vj))| ≥ d+(vj), then no additional colour-brushes
duplicate entries. If |P∗
are required. Therefore, the tattooing count is less than or equal to the brushing
0 (Xt=1(vj))| < d+(vj), then add the minimum additional distinct
count.
t=1(vj) = {c1, c2, c3, . . . , cω} ∪ Xt=1(vj), such
primary colours say ω, to obtain X(cid:48)
t=1(vj))| ≥ d+(vj). Clearly, the cardinality of the set with additional
that |P∗
t=1(vj))| is less than the additional brushes required for brush
colour-brushes, |P∗
cleaning at t = 1.

0 (X(cid:48)

0 (X(cid:48)

The result can be settled by proceeding through cases (i) to (iii) and for t =

2, 3, . . . , (cid:96).

The next lemma is useful in determining the exact minimum number of additional

primary colours to be added, if need be.
Lemma 2.3. If, in the ith-step, a vertex v ∈ V (G(cid:48)) has d−
κ colour-brushes (after blending) allocated and (cid:96) > κ, then

G(cid:48)(v) = 0, d+

G(cid:48)(v) = (cid:96) and

(i) If no primary colours (colour-brushes) have been allocated, either the exact
minimum additional distinct primary colours to be added is (cid:100)log2((cid:96) − κ + 1)(cid:101),
(ii) If ω distinct primary colours have been allocated, either the exact minimum

additional distinct primary colours to be added is (cid:100)log2( (cid:96)−κ

ω+1 + 1)(cid:101).

Proof. Part (i): Since primary colour blends may not blend into secondary colours
a minimum set X of primary colours must be allocated in order to ensure that after
mutation, at least ((cid:96) − κ) additional colour-brushes are available. Let |X| = x and
hence we solve for x in the inequality minx(2x − 1) ≥ ((cid:96)− κ). Therefore, a minimum
of exactly x = (cid:100)log2((cid:96) − κ + 1)(cid:101) primary colours must be allocated additionally.

Part (ii): Assume that a minimum of x additional primary colours are to be
added. Then, after mutation, 2x − 1 additional colour blends have been added.
Further to this, the existing ω primary colours may one-on blend with these new
2x − 1 colour blends. Hence a total of (2x − 1)(ω + 1) additional colour-brushes
have been added. Hence, we must solve for x in, minx((2x − 1)(ω + 1) ≥ ((cid:96) − κ).
Therefore, x = (cid:100)log2( (cid:96)−κ

ω+1 + 1)(cid:101).

We note that ﬁrst part of Lemma 2.3 is a special case of the second part of Lemma
2.3 and ω = 0 in the ﬁrst part.

In [16], it is shown that for any tree T with do(T ) vertices of odd degree,

br(T ) = do(T )

2

. With the aforesaid as basis, the next result follows.

Theorem 2.4 (Erika’s Theorem1). For any tree T and any vertex v ∈ V (T ) of odd
degree, there exists at least one optimal orientation corresponding to τ (T ) which,
after completion of tattooing, allows at least one colour-brush residing at v and
for a vertex u ∈ V (T ) of even degree, there does not exist any optimal orientation
corresponding to τ (T ) which, after completion of tattooing, allows a colour-brush
residing at u.

Proof. Consider any tree T after completion of tattooing corresponding to τ (T ).
Add a pendent w to any vertex v of T to obtain another tree T (cid:48). If v has odd degree
in T , then it has even degree in T (cid:48) and do(T ) = do(T (cid:48)) and hence br(T ) = br(T (cid:48)). The
latter is only possible if at least one optimal orientation exists which, on completion
of tattooing T , allows at least one colour-brush residing at v .

If v has even degree in T , then it has odd degree in T (cid:48) and hence do(T (cid:48)) = do(T )+2.
Therefore, br(T (cid:48)) = br(T ) + 1. If an optimal orientation exists corresponding to
τ (T ) which, on completion of tattooing T , allows a colour-brush residing at v then,
br(T (cid:48)) = br(T ) which is a contradiction.

2.1 Tattoo Number of Certain Graphs
Recall that a conventional friendship graph F r(3, n), where n ≥ 1, is a graph in
which n copies of the triangle C3 share a common vertex.

i + 2,

Proof. Part (i): Since F r(1, 3) = C3 the result is obvious. Let the common vertex
be labeled u and consider the cycles per se to be labeled cycle 1 and cycle 2.
Corresponding to the cycle number, label the vertices of cycle 1 to be v1,1, v2,1, and
those of cycle 2, v1,2, v2,2 respectively. For tattooing to be allowed to initiate at
vertex u a minimum number of 3 primary colours are needed. If two primary colours
are allocated to say, v1,1 tattooing of cycle 1 is allowed with {c1, c2} or {c1, c1,2} or
{c2, c1,2} arriving at u. Since F (cid:48)(cid:48)r(2, 3) = C3, the result follows.

Part (ii): Let the common vertex be labeled u and consider the cycles per se
to be labeled cycle 1, cycle 2, cycle 3. Corresponding to the cycle number, label
the vertices of cycle 1, v1,1, v2,1, cycle 2, v1,2, v2,2 and those of cycle 3, v1,3, v2,3
respectively. For tattooing to be allowed to initiate at vertex u a minimum number
of 3 primary colours are needed because P0({c1, c2, c3}) > 6. If 2 primary colours
are allocated to the vertex, say v1,1, then the tattooing of cycle 1 is allowed with
{c1, c2} or {c1, c1,2} or {c2, c1,2} arriving at u. Since F (cid:48)(cid:48)r(3, 3) = F r(2, 3), the result
follows.

Part (iii): Let the common vertex be labeled u and consider the cycles per se
to be labeled cycle 1, cycle 2, cycle 3, . . . , cycle n. Corresponding to the cycle
number, label the vertices of cycle 1, v1,1, v2,1, cycle 2, v1,2, v2,2. . . and those of cycle
n, v1,n, v2,n respectively. We have d(u) = 2n and clearly for n ≥ 4, it is optimal to
allocated the minimum number of primary colours at vertex u. The proof of the
latter part is also similar. Clearly, for 4 ≤ n ≤ 7, we have 8 ≤ d(u) ≤ 14 and hence
since 23 − 1 < 8 and 24 − 1 > 14, τ (F r(3, n)) = 4; 4 ≤ n ≤ 7. The latter can be
expressed as τ (F r(3, n)) = i + 2, i = 2 and 2i ≤ n ≤ 2i+1 − 1. As all expressions
are well-deﬁned the general result follows through immediate induction.

Next, we introduce the notion of a new family of graphs namely J9-graphs and

the notion of a Joost graph as follows.
Deﬁnition 2.5. Consider the inter-connected paths u1, v1,j, v2,j, . . . , vn−2,j, u2, n ≥ 3
for j = 1, 2, 3, . . . , k, where k ≥ 1. The family of graphs is called J9-graphs.2 A
member of the J9-graphs is denoted P (k)

and is called a Joost graph.

ering Deﬁnition 2.5 the common end-vertices are u1, u2. Consider the paths to
be path 1, path 2, path 3, respectively. From Deﬁnition 2.5 it follows that the
internal vertices are v1,1, v2,1, . . . , vn−2,1, v1,2, v2,2, . . . , vn−2,2 and v1,3, v2,3, . . . , vn−2,3.
As d(u1) = d(u2) = 3 and 22 − 1 = 3 the allocation of {c1, c2} to the vertex, say
u1, suﬃces and is clearly a minimum allocation. Combining k = 2, 3 allows the

well-deﬁned, the general result follows through immediate induction.

Note that the result in Proposition 2.6 is equivalent to τ (P (k)

n )) = i + 1, if
i = 0, 1, 2, . . . and 2i ≤ k ≤ 2i+1 − 1. We also observe that the method of proof
of Proposition 2.5 and Proposition 2.6 illustrate the principles that in a friendship
graph (F r(3, n)) the optimal tattooing sequence must initiate at a vertex with
minimum degree, δ(F r(3, n)) whilst for a Joost graph (P (k)
n ), the optimal tattooing
sequence must begin at a vertex with maximum degree, ∆(P (k)

n ).

3 Conclusion

In this paper, we have discussed a new concept namely tattooing, as a colouring
extension of cleaning models used in graph theory and introduced some interesting
concepts and parameters in that area. We have also pointed out that the concept
of tattooing has many real world applications and many of them are still to be
explored and to be discovered. This impression is mainly based on the fact that
many biological or virtual propagation models or mechanisms rely on mutation to
reach a threshold level before propagation ignites.

Tattooing and the Tattoo Number of Graphs

Besides determining the invariants bτ (G), TF SG(G) and τ (G) the invariant T(G)
is open for complexity and probability analysis. Determining the tattoo number of
diﬀerent graph classes oﬀers much for further investigations. An algorithmic study
of this graph parameter is also worth for future studies.
