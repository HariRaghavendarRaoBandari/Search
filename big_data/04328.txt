PRECISE DEVIATIONS RESULTS FOR THE MAXIMA OF SOME

DETERMINANTAL POINT PROCESSES: THE UPPER TAIL

PETER EICHELSBACHER, THOMAS KRIECHERBAUER, AND KATHARINA SCH ¨ULER

Abstract. We prove precise deviations results in the sense of Cram´er and Petrov
for the upper tail of the distribution of the maximal value for a special class of
determinantal point processes that play an important role in Random Matrix The-
ory. Here we cover all three regimes of moderate, large and superlarge deviations
for which we determine the leading order description of the tail probabilities. As
a corollary of our results we identify the region within the regime of moderate de-
viations for which the limiting Tracy-Widom law still predicts the correct leading
order behavior.

Our proofs use that the determinantal point process is given by the Christoﬀel-
Darboux kernel for an associated familiy of orthogonal polynomials. The neces-
sary asymptotic information on this kernel has mostly been obtained in [27] using
the Deift-Zhou [16] nonlinear steepest descent method for Riemann-Hilbert prob-
lems, following and improving on previous applications [14, 15, 29, 39] to orthog-
onal polynomials and to random matrices. In the superlarge regime the results of
[27] do not suﬃce and we put stronger assumptions on the point processes. The
results of the present paper and the relevant parts of [27] have been proved in the
dissertation [36].

1. Introduction

In this paper we consider a class of determinantal point processes that is promi-
nent in Random Matrix Theory. There a well studied ensemble type consists of
probability measures on N × N Hermitian matrices that are invariant under unitary
conjugation (unitary invariant ensembles) and for which the joint distribution of the
vector λ ∈ RN of eigenvalues has a density of the form
(1.1)

PN,V (λ) = Z −1

e−N V (λr ).

The function V : R → R should be viewed as a parameter of the model and is
supposed to have suﬃcient growth at ±∞ such that the measure can be normalized
by a constant ZN,V . Note that choosing V to be a quadratic function leads to
the classic Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We refer the interested reader to
[1, 2, 11, 23, 33, 34] for recent monographs on Random Matrix Theory.

The determinantal nature of the point process on R induced by the probability
measure dPN,V (λ) = PN,V (λ)dλ on N -point conﬁgurations is due to the square
of the Vandermonde determinant appearing in (1.1). In fact, there exist functions
KN,V : R2 → R such that all marginal densities (also called correlation functions) can
be expressed as determinants of the N×N matrix KN,V (λ) := (KN,V (λj, λk))1≤j,k≤N
and of its principal minors, e.g. PN,V (λ) = 1
[37, Sec.
2.3], see also [2, Sec. 4.2], [1, Chapters 4, 11] and references therein). Moreover,
the kernels can be expressed in terms of orthogonal polynomials wrt the measure

N ! det[KN,V (λ)] (see e.g.

We are interested in deviations results for the distribution of the largest compo-
nent λmax := max{λ1, . . . , λN} of λ in the limit as N → ∞. In order to be deﬁnite
in our subsequent discussion we now introduce the general assumptions (GA) on
the functions V that will be required throughout this paper. These are certainly
not the most general conditions for our results to hold true but they reduce the
technicalities in the proofs to a minimum.

(GA) A function V is said to satisfy (GA) if (1)–(3) hold:

(1) V : R → R is real analytic.
(2) V ′ is strictly monotonically increasing (convexity assumption).
(3) lim|x|→∞ V (x) = ∞.
Note that conditions (2) and (3) imply at least linear growth of V (x) for |x| → ∞
One important ingredient in the analysis of the probability measure PN,V on RN

that suﬃces to ensure the integrability of PN,V .

is the functional

NPN

j=1 δλj . Then PN,V (λ) = Z −1

deﬁned on M1(R) := {µ : µ Borel measure on R with µ(R) = 1}. The connection can
be explained heuristically as follows: Associate any λ = (λ1, . . . , λN ) ∈ RN with its
N,V e−N 2 ˜IV (µλ)
normalized counting measure µλ := 1
where ˜IV diﬀers from IV by excluding the diagonal from the domain of integration in
the ﬁrst summand of (1.3). It is now plausible that PN,V concentrates around those
vectors λ for which IV (µλ) is close to the inﬁmum of IV (µ) where µ ranges over
M1(R). In fact, this observation can be used to derive a large deviations principle
for both the counting measure µλ and for λmax under PN,V for V satisfying (GA)
(see e.g. [2, Sec. 2.6] and references therein). For a deﬁnition of a large deviations
principle, see [17]. However, this is not the approach of the present paper in which
the analysis is based on the determinantal representation of PN,V .

Let us summarize some well known facts about the minimization of the functional
IV , see e.g. [11, Chap. 6], [34, Chap. 11] and references therein, see also [36, Chap.
2] for a derivation of the facts relevant in the present paper. For a large class
of functions V , including those satisfying (GA), the functional IV has a unique
minimizer µV that is called the equilibrium measure with respect to the external
ﬁeld V . The equilibrium measure µV has compact support and we denote by bV the
maximum of its support. From a heuristic point of view we expect λmax to ﬂuctuate
around bV . In order to describe these ﬂuctuations it is known that the gradient LV
of IV at µV comes into play. It is given by

(1.4)

log |x − y|−1dµV (y) + V (x),

x ∈ R.

LV (x) = 2ZR

The Euler-Lagrange equations for the above variational problem imply that there
exists a real number lV such that LV equals lV on the support of µV and is ≥ lV
elsewhere. Hence the function

(1.5)

ηV := LV − lV

is non-negative and vanishes identically on the support of the equilibrium measure.
Observe that ηV coincides with the rate function of the large deviations principle
for λmax, see [2, Sec. 2.6, Theorem 2.6.6].

It is a remarkable and useful fact that in the case of strictly convex and suﬃciently
smooth functions V (e.g. C 3 will do) there is an almost explicit representation for
ηV : There exist - and this is the implicit part - unique reals aV < bV , called Mhaskar-
Rakhmanov-Saﬀ numbers, that are uniquely deﬁned by the two equations

we have:

This implies in particular for x > bV that ηV is of order (x− bV )3/2 near bV . More

precisely, for small positive values of x − bV the following holds:

Note that the prefactor 4
3 has no signiﬁcance other than the standard convention
that γV = 1 for V (x) = x2/2. Secondly, we remind the reader that the equilibrium
measure can also be expressed in terms of the just deﬁned quantities. Indeed, on its
support µV is given by dµV (x) = 1

After this brief review we are now ready to return to the discussion of the ﬂuc-
tuations of λmax around bV . They are of order N −2/3 and, appropriately rescaled
(here we also need the just deﬁned γV ), they are asymptotically described by the
celebrated (β = 2) Tracy-Widom distribution FT W [38], i.e.

2πp(bV − x)(x − aV )GV (x)dx.

uniformly for s ∈ R (see e.g. [1, Sec 6.3], [12, Chap. 6], [34, Sec. 13.1] and references
therein). This result can be viewed as an analogue of the Central Limit Theorem for
the arithmetic mean of N iid variables. Note that the role of the normal distribution
is taken by the Tracy-Widom distribution and that the power law of the ﬂuctuations
has changed from N −1/2 to N −2/3. As it is the case for the classical CLT it is natural
to ask for corresponding deviations results. Roughly speaking this means to describe
how fast the tail probabilities tend to zero if s is not kept ﬁxed as in (1.10) but is
allowed to grow with N . In this paper we are only concerned with the upper tail.

Before we formulate our precise deviations results for λmax in Theorems 1.1 and
1.5 we begin by stating our results in a weaker but possibly more familiar form that
is related to the large deviations principles introduced by Varadhan (see e.g. [17]).
We will show in Corollary 1.2 how to derive these from our main results.

where the O-term is uniform for t in compact subsets of (bV ,∞). Formula (1.11)
implies in particular a large deviations principle for λmax with speed N and rate
function JV (t) = ηV (t) if t ≥ bV and JV (t) = ∞ otherwise. Indeed we obtain for
N log PN,V (λmax ≤ t) = −∞ applying the large deviations
any t < bV that lim supN
principle for the empirical measure of the eigenvalues, see [2, (2.6.30)]. Further-
more, one can remark that together with the assertion limN
N log PN,V (λmax ≥ t) =
−ηV (t) for all t ≥ bV , Theorem 4.1.11 in [17] allows us to derive a large deviations
principle from the limiting behavior of probabilities for a basis of topology, see also
[21]. Observe, that for any V satisfying condition (GA), growth-condition (2.6.2)
and Assumption 2.6.5 in [2, Theorem 2.6.6] are fulﬁlled. The latter follows from
Lemma 4.5 and Lemma 4.6 in [26] (for discrete Coulomb gases, but the proof for
a continuous Coulomb gas is essentially the same). Hence (1.11) reproves Theorem
2.6.6 in [2] under stronger assumptions but provides more information on the higher
order terms.

Large deviations principles for extremal values have already been proved in a much
more general setting of mean ﬁeld models with Coulomb gas interactions that do not
necessarily possess the structure of determinantal point processes, (see [6], [2, Sec.
2.6.2], [26, Sec. 4], [22], [7] and [10]). Note that these results do not provide rates of
convergence as presented in (1.11). Another class of repulsive particle systems that
is not determinantal but can be expressed as an average of determinantal ones by a
stochastic linearization procedure has been introduced in [24]. For such ensembles
a result comparable to (1.11) has been obtained in [28]. Recently in [3] the author
proves a large deviations principle for the largest eigenvalue of Wigner matrices
without Gaussian tails, namely such that the distribution tails P (|X1,1| > t) and
P (|X1,2| > t) behave like e−btα
respectively for some a, b ∈ (0,∞) and
α ∈ (0, 2). The large deviations principle is of speed N α/2 and with an explicit rate
function depending only on the tail distributions of the Xi,j.
We turn to the regime of moderate deviations. Theorem 1.1 implies for any

α ∈ (0, 2

where the O-terms are uniform for s ∈ [1, N 2/3], thus connecting the Tracy-Widom
regime with the regime of large deviations.
In the regime of moderate deviations less is known. Upper and lower bounds on
the left hand side of (1.13) of the correct order were shown in [30] for Hermitian
β-ensembles that are determinantal for β = 2 only and agree in this case with
the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. A result of the form (1.13) has been proved in
[28] for the class of repulsive particle systems introduced in [24]. Finally we refer
the reader to the moderate deviations results in [18, 19, 20] on certain statistics of
eigenvalues for Wigner matrices and to the moderate deviations results in [5, 31, 32]
on combinatorial models that are closely related to Random Matrix Theory.

As already mentioned, all the above results follow from our precise deviations
results in the sense of Cram´er and Petrov. Here the goal is to identify the leading

order description of PN,V (λmax > t) resp. PN,V (eλmax > s), i.e. to identify functions
FN,V resp. eFN,V such that PN,V (λmax > t) /FN,V (t) resp. PN,V (eλmax > s)/eFN,V (s)

tend to 1 as N → ∞ in suitable subsets of the (t, N ) resp. (s, N ) plane. For example,
for any bounded subset B ⊂ [0,∞) we learn from the Tracy-Widom law (1.10) that
for (s, N ) ∈ B × N we have

By this we mean that for any sequence (sN , N )N in B × N relation (1.14) holds
with s being replaced by sN . Observe that due to the fast decay of 1 − FT W (s) for
s → ∞ (see (1.21) below) even optimal control on the rate of convergence in (1.10)
would only allow to extend this result to values of s that grow at most of order
(log N )2/3 with N . In this paper we are able to show that, in fact, (1.14) holds true

Theorem 1.1. Assume that V satisﬁes (GA) and recall the notation introduced
above. Then the upper tail probability satisﬁes for all t > bV the relation:

PN,V (λmax > t) = FN,V (t)(cid:16)1 + O(cid:16)

N (t−bV )3/2(cid:17)(cid:17) ,

with a uniform O-term for t in bounded subsets of (bV ,∞).

Observe that Theorem 1.1 immediately implies (1.11) with the uniformity of the
O-term claimed there. We would like to point out that for (1.16) the uniformity of
the O-term is stated not only for compact but for bounded subsets of (bV ,∞) extend-
ing the region of validity up to bV . Note, however, that there exists a positive number
CV depending on the constant in the O-term such that for 0 < t − bV ≤ CV N −2/3
statement (1.16) already follows from the boundedness of PN,V (λmax > t) /FN,V (t)
which is easy to derive using (1.7) - (1.9). This lack of informative value of (1.16)
for these values of t is no problem since they belong to the Tracy-Widom regime
and (1.14) with [0, γV CV ] ⊂ B ﬁlls the gap.
Next we turn to the regime of moderate deviations N −2/3 << t << 1, where
by (1.16) we have PN,V (λmax > t) /FN,V (t) → 1 as N → ∞. It is instructive to

translate this result to the rescaled variableeλmax. Since

PN,V (eλmax > s) = PN,V (λmax > t(s)) with t(s) := bV +

we only need to evaluate FN,V (t(s)). Using again (1.7) - (1.9) and the assumed real
analyticity of V one obtains for positive s = o(N 2/3), i.e. in particular in the regime
of moderate deviations, that

From these formulas (1.13) is immediate, at least for s ∈ [C, cN 2/3] where the
positve numbers c, C depend on the constants in the O-terms of (1.16) and (1.18).
To extend (1.13) to all of [1, N 2/3] one may use the monotonicty of PN,V (eλmax > s)
in s for the lower end and for the upper end one shows that s3/2eN ηV (t(s))FN,V (t(s))
is bounded away from 0.
We return to the leading order description for PN,V (eλmax > s) in the regime of

moderate deviations. The ﬁrst observation is that combining (1.16) - (1.19) leads to
a series representation for the upper tail that is the exact analogue to the Cram´er
series for sums of independent variables [9], see also [35, Sec. 5.8]. Secondly, in
order to determine the leading order we only need to keep those terms of the series
in (1.19) that do not vanish as N becomes large. A computation shows that for any
k ∈ N0 and positive s we have in the limit N → ∞

(cid:3)

To the best of our knowledge there are three deviations results in the literature
of comparable precision for models that have the Tracy-Widom distribution as their
limit law. The ﬁrst two are concerned with the upper tail in the moderate regime:
Firstly, in [31] the leading order description is given for the length of the longest
increasing subsequence of a random permutation. Secondly, for the largest particles
from ensembles that were introduced in [24] precise deviations were proved in [28]
with slightly worse O-terms that are due to the averaging procedure that is used.
The third result is contained in [13, see (162)] and deals with the lower tail of the
the distribution of the largest eigenvalue of the Laguerre Unitary Ensemble in the
regime of moderate and large deviations.

Remark 1.4. An important topic of Random Matrix Theory is the question of uni-
versality. A good example for a universality result is (1.10). After an appropriate
linear rescaling that involves only two V -dependent numbers bV and γV , the dis-
tribution of the largest eigenvalue tends in the limit N → ∞ to the Tracy-Widom
distribution that has no V -dependency whatsoever. If one considers large deviations
principles one sees a transition from universal to non-universal behavior. Based on
the same rescaling as in the Tracy-Widom regime, (1.13) implies moderate devi-
ations principles with universal rate function J(s) = 4
3 s3/2. In contrast, the rate
function ηV of the large deviations principle depends fully on V .

This transition becomes even more elaborate when one considers precise devi-
ations. Again there is no universality in the regime of large deviations. How-
ever, in the regime of moderate deviations there is an inﬁnite cascade of regions
where the level of V -dependency changes. More precisely, the leading order de-

scription of PN,V (eλmax > s) is still universal for s = o(N 4/15) = o(N α0). For
N αk−1 ≤ s << N αk the leading order description depends on the k-tuple of V -
dependent numbers (d1,V , . . . , dk,V ) and this is how universality fades out as k → ∞,
i.e. when approaching the regime of large deviations. This transition can also be
observed for the class of repulsive interacting particles introduced in [24] since the
precise deviations results there are similar to ours [28, Remark 9]. However, in the
regime of large deviations the leading order description has not yet been fully under-
stood for those models and a new source of non-universality has been conjectured
there [28, Remark 7].

The task of providing the leading order description for the upper tail of λmax would
be fully completed by Corollary 1.2 if we were allowed to choose q = ∞ in statement
b) i). It therefore remains to extend the result of Theorem 1.1 to unbounded subsets
of (bV ,∞). In the case of sums of independent variables the corresponding question
has been raised under the heading of “Superlarge Deviations” (see e.g. [8]) and we
will also use this terminology.

Our second main result states that under additional assumptions on V the leading
order description of the upper tail remains unchanged also in the superlarge regime.
In order to formulate our result we introduce new conditions on V that concern
both the size of the region on that V can be extended analytically and the growth
of Re(V (z)) as Re(z) → ∞ on this region.

Moreover, there exists a constant dV > 0 such that for all z ∈ U (n, x0):

Re(V (z)) ≥ dV · Re(z).

Our result on Superlarge Deviations, which appears to be the ﬁrst in the realm
of Random Matrix Theory, Interacting Particle systems and related combinatorial
models, reads:
Theorem 1.5. Assume that V satisﬁes (GA)∞ together with V ′′(x)
V ′(x)2 = O(1) for
x → ∞. Recall the deﬁnition of FN,V in (1.15). Then, for suﬃciently large values
of N ,

(1.22)
with a uniform O-term for t ∈ [bV + 1,∞).

PN,V (λmax > t) = FN,V (t)(cid:0)1 + O(cid:0) 1
N(cid:1)(cid:1) ,

The assumptions that are imposed on V in addition to (GA) are in no way
optimal. They are chosen such that at least convex polynomials and in particular
the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble are included. For V that do not satisfy these extra
conditions one may try to modify the arguments in the proofs of Lemmas 3.2 and
A.2. One sees e.g.
from the arguments around (A.13) that the faster V (x) grows
for x → ∞ the smaller the domain of analyticity of V needs to be.
The key in proving both of our theorems is that the probabilities for the upper
tail PN,V (λmax > t) = 1 − PN,V (λmax ≤ t) are complementary to the gap probabil-
ities that no component of λ is contained in the interval (t,∞). For determinantal
ensembles (1.1) gap probabilities can be expressed in terms of the kernel (1.2) [1,
Sec. 4.6] and one obtains

As it turns out, for all of our analysis only the ﬁrst term R ∞

In the situation of moderate and large deviations we show in Section 2 that the
asymptotic results on the Christoﬀel-Darboux kernel KN,V (x, x) provided in [27]
together with a well-known estimate on KN,V (x, x) for large values of x suﬃce to
prove Theorem 1.1. The reason why the latter estimate for large x is used in the

proof is that the leading order description of the Christoﬀel-Darboux kernel in [27]
is uniform only for x in bounded subsets of (bV ,∞). In order to treat superlarge
deviations uniformity is also required in unbounded subsets of (bV ,∞). This is
achieved in Section 3 under additional assumptions on V that are formulated in
Theorem 1.5. In this situation some of the arguments of [27] need to be improved
which is the content of the Appendix.

Finally, we like to mention that we are also able to treat the case that the domain
of deﬁnition of V is bounded, but still contains the support of the equilibrium
measure µV in its interior. We refer the reader to Remark 2.2.

2. Proof of Theorem 1.1

As advertised at the end of the Introduction we begin by analyzing the ﬁrst

summand of (1.23).

Lemma 2.1. Assume that V satisﬁes (GA) and let ηV and FN,V be given as in
(1.5) (see also (1.8)) and (1.15). There exists a number C > 0 such that for all
t ∈ (bV + CN −2/3,∞) we have

KN,V (x, x) dx = FN,V (t)(cid:16)1 + O(cid:16)

N (t−bV )3/2(cid:17)(cid:17) .

The error bound is uniform for t in bounded subsets of (bV + CN −2/3,∞).
Proof. Let S > bV be arbitrary but ﬁxed. We derive (2.1) uniformly for t ∈ (bV +
CN −2/3, S]. We ﬁrst show that we only need to consider the integral on a bounded
domain. To this end, observe that it follows from (1.15), (1.8), and (1.7) that there
exist positive numbers d, D such that FN,V (t) ≥ de−N D for all N and all t ∈ (bV , S]
(choose e.g. D = ηV (S) + 1). Next, we use that KN,V (x, x) = N ρN (x) where ρN
denotes the marginal density ρN (x) = RRN −1 PN,V (x, y) dy. Well-known estimates
from the theory of Log-Gases (see e.g.
[34, Theorem 11.1.2], see also [24, Lemma
5.2], [25, Lemma 4.4]) together with the fact that any V satisfying (GA) grows at
least linearly for x → ∞ yield the existence of positive constants L, ˆD, τ such that
ρN (x) ≤ ˆDe−N τ x for all N and x ≥ L. Choosing M ≥ L with M τ > D we see that

uniformly for t ∈ (bV , S]. We turn to the remaining part of the integral over the
domain (t, M ) where we may assume M > S + 1 without loss of generality. In this
domain we now use the information on the integrand provided by [27, Theorem 1.5
(ii)]. Observe that the result in [27] is stated using a linear rescaling λV that maps
t + bV +aV
[−1, 1] onto [aV , bV ]: λV (t) = bV −aV
. Note in addition that the function
ηV of the present paper equals ηV ◦ λ−1
V in [27]. It follows that there exists a positve
number C (corresponding to c−1 in [27]) such that

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let C denote the constant introduced in Lemma 2.1. Bound-
ing the probability measure PN,V by 1 it follows from (1.8) and from the boundedness
of GV that the quotient PN,V (λmax > t) /FN,V (t) is a bounded function of t on the
interval (bV , bV + CN −2/3]. Therefore formula (1.16) holds in that region simply by
an appropriate choice for the constant in the O-term.
From now on we may restrict our attention to values t ∈ (bV + CN −2/3, S] for
some arbitrary but ﬁxed number S > bV . For such values of t we ﬁrst record the

In order to use (2.9) for the estimates of the summands in (1.23) with k ≥ 2 we
recall a basic fact from linear algebra. Suppose that A = (Aij)ij is a real, positive

Remark 2.2. Formula (2.3), which is central in the proof of Theorem 1.1, is derived in
[27, Theorem 1.5 (ii)] in a slightly more general setting. There real analytic functions
V : J → R are considered with J = [L−, L+] ∩ R and −∞ ≤ L− < L+ ≤ ∞. In
addition to conditions (GA)(2) and (GA)(3) (in the case of inﬁnite L− resp. L+)
it is assumed that there exist L− < aV < bV < L+ solving equations (1.6), which
implies that the support of the equilibrium measure is contained in the interior of
J. In Random Matrix Theorie this corresponds to the case of “soft edges” (see [27,
(GA)1] and the discussion preceeding it).

In the case of L+ < ∞ the tail probabilities PN,V (λmax > t) are obviously equal
to 0 for t ≥ L+. For bV < t < L+ the leading order of PN,V (λmax > t) is provided
by the leading order of the integral

A computation shows that FN,V (t) describes the leading order of PN,V (λmax > t) if
N (L+ − t) → ∞ for N → ∞. For all this as well as for the results of Theorems 1.1
and 1.5 it is irrelevant whether L− is ﬁnite or inﬁnite (see [36] for more details).

In the same way as Theorem 1.1 followed from Lemma 2.1 the result on superlarge

Lemma 3.1. Assume that V satisﬁes (GA)∞ together with V ′′(x)

subsequent lemma.
(cid:3)

Lemma 3.2. Assume that V satisﬁes (GA) and furthermore V ′′(x)
x → ∞. Then (3.3) holds uniformly for all t ≥ bV + 1.
Proof. We begin by comparing ηV with V . Using that the equilibrium measure µV
is a probability measure supported on [aV , bV ] it follows from the deﬁnition of ηV
via (1.5), (1.4) that for all x ≥ bV + 1 we have
(3.4)

V ′(x)2 = O(1) for

|ηV (x) − V (x)| ≤ |lV | + 2 log(x − aV ),

Note that for u > 0 we have x(u) ≥ x(ξu) ≥ t ≥ bV + 1. Using the monotonicity of
f it suﬃces to show the boundedness of f ′(ξ)/f (ξ) for all ξ ≥ 0, i.e. x(ξ) ≥ bV + 1.
For x(ξ) in bounded subsets of [bV + 1,∞) this follows from (2.7) as in the proof of
Lemma 2.1. In order to treat the case of large values of x(ξ) we ﬁrst observe that
V ′(bV ) > 0 (see e.g. [36, Lemma 2.1]) implying the boundedness of 1/V ′(x) and of
V ′′(x)/V ′(x)2 for x ≥ bV by the assumptions on V (recall in particular (GA)(2)).

A. Appendix

The purpose of this appendix is to establish asymptotic formula (3.2) that was
used in the proof of Theorem 1.5. We formulate the corresponding result in Theorem
A.1 which improves on the O-term in [27, Theorem 1.5 (ii)] for unbounded domains
under more restrictive assumptions on V than present in [27].

Theorem A.1. Assume that V satisﬁes (GA)∞. Then, for suﬃciently large values
of N , (3.2) holds uniformly for all x ≥ bV + 1.
Proof. We begin by recalling the main steps in the proof of [27, Theorem 1.5 (ii)].
First one needs to relate the Christoﬀel-Darboux kernel to the solution of a Riemann-
Hilbert problem. Keeping in mind the linear scaling λV that is used in [27] (recall

PRECISE DEVIATIONS RESULTS

our explanation before (2.3)) the ﬁrst equation below [27, (4.7)] reads for x 6= y, x,
y ∈ [bV + 1,∞):

m(y)T(cid:18)0 −1

0 (cid:19) A−1 ˆR+(y)−1 ˆR+(x)A m(x),

where A denotes an invertible complex 2 × 2-matrix [27, (4.3)], the vector valued
function m is deﬁned by m := k ◦ λ−1
V with k as given in [27, Theorem 1.3 (a), case
x > 1], and ﬁnally ˆR+ := R+ ◦ λ−1
V with the matrix valued function R+ of [27,
Lemma 3.8]. Note that R+ also depends on N which is suppressed in the notation.
Let us ﬁrst evaluate m. Keeping in mind that ηV of the present paper equals

ηV ◦ λ−1
(A.2)

V of [27] and using deﬁnition [27, (1.18)] we compute

m(x) :=

2 ηV (x)(cid:18) cV (x)
cV (x)−1(cid:19) ,

cV (x) :=

Before discussing ˆR we can already explain how the leading order description of
KN,V (x, x) arises. Write

(A.3)

ˆR+(y)−1 ˆR+(x) = Id + ˆR+(y)−1( ˆR+(x) − ˆR+(y)) =: (1) + (2) .

The contribution to KN,V (x, x) from the ﬁrst summand (1)=Id, i.e. replace in (A.1)
the term ˆR+(y)−1 ˆR+(x) by Id and take the limit y → x, is given by

e−N ηV (x)

and hence equals the leading order term in (3.2). To estimate the contribution from
(2) in (A.3) we use Lemma A.2 below that takes the role of [27, Theorem 3.9] in the
proof of [27, Theorem 1.5 (ii)]. Denote by X0 the positive number that is introduced
in Lemma A.2. Statement (ii) of Lemma A.2 and the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus provide ˆR+(x)− ˆR+(y) = O( |x−y|
N xy ) for all x, y > X0 with x 6= y. Statement
(i) implies that there exists a X1 ≥ X0 such that for all y > X1 the matrix ˆR+(y) is
suﬃciently close to the identity matrix such that ˆR+(y)−1 is uniformly bounded for
y > X1 and for all N . It follows from (A.2) that m(x) = e− N
2 ηV (x)O(1) uniformly for
x > X0. The combination of all these estimates shows that the contribution of the
second summand (2) in (A.3) to KN,V (x, x), again in the limit y → x, is bounded
by

uniformly for x > X1. Thus we are only left to prove (3.2) uniformly for x ∈
[bV + 1, X1] in case this set is not empty. This, however, follows already from [27,
Theorem 1.5 (ii)].
(cid:3)

We now turn to the analysis of the matrix valued function ˆR+ that equals R+ of
[27] up to the linear rescaling λV . The function R is analytic on C \ ΣR, where ΣR
[27, Figure 2] and
denotes an unbounded contour that is sketched in Figure 1 (cf.
observe that the rightmost circle is not present since we are in the case J = R). Note
that the role of bV is taken by 1 since we consider R instead of ˆR. The deﬁnition of
R is rather involved [27, Lemma 3.8] but we do not need it. All that is important
for us is that R solves the Riemann-Hilbert problem stated in [27, Lemma 3.8 (i)R,
(ii)R]. The functions R± that appear there are deﬁned on ΣR as the limits of R
when approaching ΣR from the left resp. right with respect to the orientation of

ΣR. This ﬁnally answers the question how the function ˆR+ is deﬁned that appears

Figure 1. The contour ΣR.

The next piece of information that we use from [27, Lemma 3.8] is the smallness
of ∆R that appears in the jump matrix of the Riemann-Hilbert problem for R, i.e.
for ζ ∈ ΣR:
(A.4)

R+(ζ) = R−(ζ) [Id +∆R(ζ)]

and

k∆RkL1(ΣR) + k∆RkL∞(ΣR) = O(cid:0)N −1(cid:1) .

This implies for suﬃciently large values of N that R has a representation as a Cauchy
transform

where ˜µ is the solution of a particular singular integral equation (see [27, Proof of
Theorem 3.9, in particular (3.35)], cf. [11, Sec. 7.5] for more background informa-
tion). From the smallness of ∆R as expressed in (A.5) it follows that the underlying

singular integral operator is of the form Id +O(cid:0)N −1(cid:1) as an operator on L2(ΣR) and

its inverse is thus uniformly bounded for N suﬃciently large. This then gives

(A.5)

(A.7)

k˜µkL2(ΣR) = O(cid:0)N −1(cid:1)

for N suﬃciently large. In fact, this is the only argument in the proof of Theorem 1.5
where we use that N is assumed to be big. For the remaining part of our discussion
we assume that N satisﬁes this requirement.

There is a diﬃculty in using (A.6) for our purposes. We are interested in R+(x)
for large values of x. Therefore x ∈ ΣR and the singularity in the denominator of
(A.6) does not allow for pointwise bounds if we only know that the numerator is in
some Lq space.

As in [27] we deal with this issue by using the assumed real analyticity of V .
Then, by (1.5), (1.4), the function ηV is also real analytic. From the deﬁnition of
∆R [27, (3.24), (3.10)] on the relevant part of ΣR, i.e. the rightmost half line in
Figure 1, it follows that the jump matrix Id +∆R of the Riemann-Hilbert problem
(A.4) also has an analytic extension. In this situation one may deform the contour of
the Riemann-Hilbert problem into the region of analyticity of the jump matrix (see
e.g. [11, Sec. 7.3] for a discussion in a more general setting). Given x large, we use
the contour Σx that is obtained from ΣR by replacing the interval (x − κx, x + κx)
by a half circle as shown in Figure 2.
Of course, κx > 0 has to be chosen such that the lower half disc centered at x and
with radius κx is contained in the domain of analyticity of ∆R. The jump matrix
of the modiﬁed Riemann-Hilbert problem is still given by Id +∆R on the lower half
circle and its solution Rx coincides with R except on the lower half disc. Thus we
have

(A.8)

R+(x) = Rx(x)

and

Figure 2. Extract from the contour Σx.

Again we may express the solution Rx of the modiﬁed Riemann-Hilbert problem by
a Cauchy transform

(A.9)

Rx(z) − Id =

1

2πiZΣx

(∆R + ˜µx∆R)(ζ)

ζ − z

dζ,

z ∈ C \ Σx.

To ensure that k˜µxkL2(Σx) = O(N −1) uniformly in x, we need to verify that relation
(A.5) holds uniformly if ΣR is replaced by Σx. Thus we have to estimate ∆R on the
lower half circle. This is the point where we begin using the additional assumptions
on V that are formulated in (GA)∞ (2). It follows from the deﬁnition [27, (3.24),

(3.10)] that ∆R(z) = O(cid:0)|e−N ηV (z)|(cid:1) for λV (z) ∈ U (n, x0) and x0 suﬃciently large.

Due to (3.4) that continues to hold on U (n, x0) it follows from the lower bound on
Re(V ) formulated in (GA)∞ (2) that also Re(ηV (z)) grows at least linearly as Re(z)
becomes large. Hence there exists ˜d > 0 such that

(A.10)

∆R(z) = O(cid:16)e−N ˜d Re(z)(cid:17)
In order to estimate R+(x)− Id = Rx(x)− Id and R′

for λV (z) ∈ U (n, x0) and x0 suﬃciently large. This clearly implies (A.5) for Σx with
an O-term that is uniform in x.
x(x) (cf. (A.8)) we
recall (A.9) that also provides a formula for R′
x:

+(x) = R′

R′

(A.11)

z ∈ C \ Σx.
For the estimates we split the contour of integration Σx in two parts

(ζ − z)2

x(z) =

dζ,

(∆R + ˜µx∆R)(ζ)

2πiZΣx

Σ(1)
x := {ζ ∈ Σx : |ζ − x| ≥ x/2}

and Σ(2)

x := {ζ ∈ Σx : |ζ − x| < x/2}.

Correspondingly we write Aj resp. Bj, j ∈ {1, 2}, for the contributions to the
values of Rx(x)− Id resp. of R′
in (A.9)
resp. in (A.11). Since k∆RkL1(Σx), k˜µxkL2(Σx), and k∆RkL2(Σx) are all of order 1/N ,
uniformly for suﬃciently large x, the numerator in (A.9), (A.11) is also of order 1/N
in the L1(Σx)-norm and it follows immediately that

x(x) that stem from integration over Σ(j)

x

(A.12)

A1 = O(cid:18) 1
N x(cid:19)

and

N x2(cid:19)
B1 = O(cid:18) 1

for suﬃciently large values of x.

We turn to the contribution from Σ(2)

x . Due to (A.10) and since the length of Σ(2)
x
is bounded by πx we have that for x large that k∆Rk = O(xe−N ˜dx/2) in both the
L1(Σ(2)
by the radius κx we obtain

x )-norm. Since the distance from x to Σ(2)
x

x )- and L2(Σ(2)

is bounded below

(A.13)

A2 = O  xe−N ˜dx/2

Assumption (GA)∞ (2) ensures that we may choose κx of order x−n which suﬃces
amply for proving that A2 resp. B2 can be bounded in the same way as A1 resp.
B1 in (A.12). In summary, we have derived

(A.14)

R+(x) − Id = O(cid:18) 1
N x(cid:19)

and

R′

N x2(cid:19)
+(x) = O(cid:18) 1

for x suﬃciently large. Since ˆR+ = R+◦ λ−1
is precisely the content of

V these estimates carry over to ˆR+ which

Lemma A.2. Assume that V satisﬁes (GA)∞ and let ˆR be deﬁned as in the proof
of Theorem A.1. Then there exists a positive X0 > bV such that for suﬃciently large
values of N

N x(cid:19)
(i) ˆR+(x) − Id = O(cid:18) 1

and

(ii) ˆR′

N x2(cid:19)
+(x) = O(cid:18) 1

hold uniformly for all x > X0.
