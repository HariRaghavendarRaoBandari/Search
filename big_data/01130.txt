We propose a scheme for deterministic generation and long-term stabilization of entanglement
between two electronic spin qubits conﬁned in spatially separated quantum dots. Our approach
relies on an electronic quantum bus, consisting either of quantum Hall edge channels or surface
acoustic waves, that can mediate long-range coupling between localized spins over distances of tens
of micrometers. Since the entanglement is actively stabilized by dissipative dynamics, our scheme
is inherently robust against noise and imperfections.

The physical realization of a large-scale quantum infor-
mation processing (QIP) architecture constitutes a fas-
cinating problem at the interface between fundamental
science and engineering [1, 2]. Further advances towards
this goal hinge upon two major challenges: (i) Control
over the undesired inﬂuences of the environment which
tend to corrupt genuine quantum properties such as en-
tanglement, and (ii) long-range coupling between the log-
ical qubits. The latter does not only relax some serious
architectural challenges [3], but also allows for applica-
tions in quantum communication, distributed quantum
computing and some of the highest tolerances in error-
correcting codes that are based on long-distance entan-
glement links [2, 4, 5].

In the solid state, electron spins conﬁned in electri-
cally deﬁned semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have
emerged as a promising platform for QIP [6, 7]: Major
building blocks such as initialization, single-shot read-
out, coherent control of single spins, and two-qubit gates
between adjacent spins have been demonstrated success-
fully [6, 7]. However, at present the integration of sev-
eral qubits into a scalable architecture still remains a
formidable challenge [6, 8, 9], because (due to short-range
interactions) a large amount of wiring and control elec-
tronics needs to be accommodated on a very small scale.
Therefore, a scalable design is likely to require long-range
couplings over distances of several micrometers [3, 10].

In this work, we propose a scheme for the determin-
istic preparation of steady-state entanglement between
remote qubits, deﬁned by electron spins in spatially sep-
arated QDs. Our approach addresses the two challenges
(i) and (ii) as described above within one uniﬁed frame-
work: (i) By suitably engineering the continuous cou-
pling of the system to its environment, our setup ac-
tively utilizes dissipation to create and stabilize quantum
coherences. This approach [11–14] comes with poten-
tially signiﬁcant advantages, as dissipative methods are
unaﬀected by timing and preparation errors and inher-
ently robust against weak random perturbations, allow-
ing (in principle) to stabilize entanglement for arbitrary

times [15–18]. (ii) Our scheme directly builds upon recent
experimental developments towards the realization of a
solid-state electronic quantum bus, where ﬂying electrons
take over the role of photons in more conventional atomic,
molecular, and optical based approaches in order to me-
diate long-range coupling between remote qubits. In par-
ticular, we consider quantum Hall edge (QHE) channels
[19–25] and surface acoustic waves (SAWs) [26–32] as ex-
emplary candidate systems for the coherent transport of
electron spins over long distances. Intuitively, the dissi-
pative entanglement creation arises from a quantum in-
terference eﬀect in the common coupling of the local-
ized spins Si(i = 1, 2) to an adjacent electronic quantum
channel, in which ﬂying electrons continuously pass by
the two localized spins. With any which-way informa-
tion absent, ﬁrst-order spin-ﬂip processes between the
localized spins and the ﬂying ancilla spins occurring in
the course of electron transport can happen either in the
ﬁrst or in the second node, which may lead to the forma-
tion of entanglement between the nodes, if two or more
such processes with a unique common entangled steady-
state dominate the dynamics [17, 33].

Dissipative engineering.—Let us ﬁrst consider two dif-
ferent generic dissipative entanglement-generating dy-
namics for the system’s density matrix (DM) ρ. A purely
dissipative master equation (ME) with a unique entan-
gled steady state is given by [14]

where S±

lution given in Eq. (1) drives the system into the (dark)
steady state |Ψss(cid:105) = µ|↑↓(cid:105) − ν |↓↑(cid:105), which is unique and
entangled for all µ, ν > 0, µ (cid:54)= ν. While the entangle-
ment is largest as µ → ν, for equality the steady state is
no longer unique. When there is more than one steady
state, the long-time behavior depends on the initial state
and may be strongly aﬀected by small perturbations; for
example, this is the case for β = 0 in Eq. (1). Still, a

The model.— In what follows, we show how our general
idea can be applied to two diﬀerent exemplary physical
setups, with the ultimate goal of (approximately) imple-
menting the paradigm entanglement-generating dynam-
ics given in Eqs. (1) and (2). First, we investigate QHE
states as this setup facilitates direct analogies to existing
quantum optical schemes with photons [23]. Thereafter,
we explore a setup based on electrically induced SAWs
where the stroboscopic control over the eﬀective interac-
tion times between stationary and mobile electron spins
[29, 30] results in larger amounts of entanglement.

In all setups speciﬁed below, to controllably amplify
the coupling between localized and ﬂying electrons, we
introduce auxiliary (ancilla) QDs that are tunnel-coupled
to the QDs hosting the qubit electrons with spin Si(i =
1, 2); by appropriate gating one can ensure that the sys-
tem dots always stay occupied with a single electron each.
An electron occupying the ancilla dot j interacts locally
with the system spin Si via the Heisenberg exchange in-
teraction [7]

The system is subject to an external magnetic ﬁeld

In a suitable rotating frame the
global homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld drops out from the
dynamics, and we are left with (small) inhomogeneous
gradient ﬁelds, described by the Zeeman Hamiltonian

can be engineered via an on-probe micro- [35] or nano-
magnet [36] and/or nuclear Overhauser ﬁelds [7].

(1) Transport via QHE states.—A two-dimensional
electron gas (2DEG) in a large magnetic ﬁeld supports
QHE channels which have proven to provide an ideal
test-bed for electronic optics-like experiments, since they
allow for ballistic, one-dimensional and chiral electron
transport [23]; with backscattering drastically reduced
due to chirality, in the QH regime the mean free path
of electrons is increased up to ∼ (0.1 − 1)mm [19–21].
Let us consider two nodes, consisting of just one system
and one ancilla dot each, with the ancilla dots intercon-
nected by such a chiral edge channel [37]; compare the

Two spatially separated qubits (S1, S2) are coupled to auxil-
iary QDs, which are interconnected by an unidirectional QH
edge channel. The upstream ancilla dot(s) are pumped selec-
tively from a Fermi reservoir with a rate γL. While the ﬁrst
(purely dissipative) scheme requires two separate QHE chan-
nels, for the second scheme a single channel suﬃces (dashed
box) together with local ESR driving ﬁelds of strength Ωi.

lution of the system and ancilla degrees of freedom of
this cascaded quantum system [34, 38], we trace out the

ism; for details see Refs.[21, 38, 39]. We then arrive at
the following Markovian ME for the reduced DM of sys-
tem and ancilla dots, ˙ = −i [HZ + HIN, ] +Ltr, where

Here, the ﬁrst term describes spin-selective pumping of
the ﬁrst ancilla dot, which could be achieved either via
ferromagnetic leads or spin-ﬁltering techniques [40]. The
last two terms give the non-local incoherent and coherent
contributions of the channel-mediated coupling between
the ancilla dots, respectively. The theoretical treatment
underlying Eq. (4) assumes weak coupling to the reser-
voir (Born approximation), a ﬂat reservoir spectral den-
sity (Markov approximation), an idealized dispersion-free
channel and the spin-resolved ancilla dot levels to be
aligned within (cid:46) γ [21, 39]. Lastly, in accordance with
the cascaded nature of the system,  in Eq. (4) accounts
for a time delay between the two nodes. Note that,
for distances ∼ µm, electron transport happens quasi-
instantaneously on the relevant timescales, such that one
can eﬀectively neglect this ﬁxed time delay; compare [39].
For fast dissipation (γ, γL (cid:29) J), the auxiliary dots set-
tle into a quasi-steady state on a timescale much shorter
than the relevant system dots dynamics.
In this case,
one can adiabatically eliminate the ancilla coordinates

(2), respectively, up to undesired terms absorbed into
L(i)
n-id. We now turn to the central question whether the
entanglement inherent to the ideal dynamics can pre-
vail in a realistic scenario. Due to the presence of the
non-ideal terms, even without further decoherence mech-
anisms, the steady state of Eqs. (5) and (6) is mixed. We
conﬁrm and quantify its entanglement using the entangle-
ment of formation EF [39, 41]. As shown in Fig. 2, the
steady state entanglement persists in the two schemes
despite the undesired terms L(i)
n-id for a broad range of
coupling parameters (J1(2) = J0 ∓ δJ). This ﬁnding
can be traced back to the spectral gap (modulus of the
largest non-zero real part of the eigenvalues of the Liou-
villian [39]) which indicates on what timescale the steady
state is reached. For optimized, but realistic parame-
ters (γL = γ = 10J0 = 30µeV), the gap is found to be
∼ 0.5J 2
0 /γ) for the purely dissipative setting
(driving scheme), which yields ∼ 5ns (∼ 20ns). Note
that the steady state will not be aﬀected signiﬁcantly by
noise processes slow compared to that timescale. This is
demonstrated explicitly for qubit dephasing due to nu-
clear spins in the (GaAs) host environment. The hy-
perﬁne interaction with the nuclei is modeled in terms
of a random, slowly evolving eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld for
the electron spins, yielding an extra Hamiltonian of the
same form as HZ, where the (random) detuning param-
eters δi are sampled independently from a normal dis-
tribution with standard deviation σnuc [7, 39]. The re-
sulting time-ensemble-averaged electron dephasing time

2/σnuc has recently been extended up to T ∗
T ∗

[42]. As shown in Fig. 2, however, already for T ∗
the purely dissipative scheme is basically unaﬀected by
nuclear noise.

In our analysis we have neglected several detrimental
eﬀects that may be encountered in an actual experiment,
an approximation that we now justify: First, at suﬃ-
ciently low temperatures T < 5K, dispersive eﬀects and
scattering out of the edge channel may be neglected for
propagation distances (cid:46) 100µm [21]. Nevertheless, in
[39] we show that even a few percent of losses can be
tolerated. Second, dephasing during propagation should
be negligible for distances that are small compared to a
characteristic coherence length scale Lφ, which we esti-
2 ≈ (102 − 103)µm for a drift velocity
mate as Lφ = vdT ∗
vd ≈ 104m/s and (due to motional narrowing) extended
2 ≈ (10− 100)ns [21, 28, 30, 31]. Then,
dephasing time T ∗
in order to suppress errors due to non-resonant dot ener-
gies, these should be controlled with a precision (cid:46) 1µeV
[21]. Finally, based on QD experiments [40] where basi-
cally 100% bipolar spin-ﬁlter eﬃciency has been demon-
strated, we have assumed perfect spin-selective driving.
Still, with all these simpliﬁcations, the amount of steady-
state entanglement (EF ≈ 0.2) that we obtain for a real-
istic scenario is modest as compared to the idealized cases
discussed in Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively, (even though

yielding a coarse-grained equation of motion for the sys-
tem spins (S1, S2) only. The subsequent full calculation
is presented in detail in Ref. [39]. To mimic Eq. (1), we
consider a purely dissipative setting with two separate
edge channels that are pumped spin-selectively by spin-
up (spin-down) electrons only, respectively, interacting
through diﬀerent ancilla dots with the qubits; compare
Fig. 1. For J1 ≡ J1,1 = J2,4 and J2 ≡ J2,2 = J1,3, the

Along the lines of our previous analysis, we present
two SAW-based schemes. To recover the purely dissipa-
tive dynamics (1), we assume alternating spin sequences
(as could be realized by proper spin-ﬁltering on sub-
nanosecond timescales [40]), together with appropriately
synchronized interaction times τi or exchange couplings

Indeed, we recover non-local dissipators of the desired

quences of spin-up and spin-down electrons (with suit-
ably synchronized couplings) then yield approximately
the desired entangling dynamics [39]. Next, to emu-
late dynamics similar to Eq. (2), we assume mobile dots

interact successively with the system spins Si for a controlled
interaction time τi.

it is still comparable to what has been predicted theoret-
ically for two adjacent dots [18] and achieved experimen-
tally for two atomic ensembles [15]). Why is that so? As
we see from Eqs. (5) and (6) the continuous interaction of
the two spin qubits with the entangled steady state of the
ancilla electrons gives rise to more than just the desired
Lindblad terms; cf. also Fig.3 in [39]. To address this
limitation, we discuss below an alternative setup which
allows for better control of the system-ancilla interactions
and therefore yields a more ideal eﬀective dynamics and
larger amounts of steady-state entanglement.

(2) Transport via SAW moving dots.— To this end we
replace the edge channels by mobile quantum dots based
on SAWs. Here, we consider two ancilla QDs which are
interconnected by a long depleted one-dimensional chan-
nel in a 2DEG; compare Fig. 3. Recently, it has been
demonstrated experimentally that in such a setup SAWs
can transfer reliably and on-demand single electrons from
one dot to the other for distances of several micrometers
[29, 30], with the potential to extend this to hundreds of
micrometers [32]. Our protocol then consists of a contin-
uous train of mobile dots that interact successively with
the two system spins Si for a (eletrostatically) controlled
time τi, very much like in a conveyor belt. Therefore, for
a single ancilla electron the protocol comprises ﬁve steps:
(i) load the ﬁrst ancilla dot with electron spin σ, (ii) in-
teract with system spin S1 via (3) for a time τ1, (iii)
transfer the electron to the second ancilla dot (generi-
cally, S1 and the mobile electron are entangled by now),
(iv) interact with system spin S2 via (3) for a time τ2, (v)
eject the electron from the second ancilla dot. The cor-
responding concatenated evolution for the two localized
spins Si(i = 1, 2) can be described by [43]

by numerical simulations, where the ancilla degrees of
freedom have not been eliminated. As demonstrated in
Fig. 4, the generation of entanglement persists even in
the presence of nuclear noise and residual time-jitter;
here, the individual dwell-times τi have been chosen ran-

Typically, the steady state is reached after ∼ 103 itera-
tions, that is within ∼ (0.1 − 1)µs for τ ≈ (0.1 − 1)ns.

Conclusions & Outlook.—We have presented a general
scheme for the deterministic generation of entanglement
between spins conﬁned in spatially separated QDs. We
have detailed our ideas for two speciﬁc electron-optics-
like setups, for which the coherence length of the cor-
responding quantum channels should allow to generate
sizeable entanglement (EF ≈ 0.2 − 0.7) over distances
of up to 100µm. While such noisy, modestly entangled
two-qubit states can be used, e.g., for quantum telepor-
tation, their main use lies in the fact that they can be
distilled into highly entangled states by means of local
operations on several copies [45, 46]. Running our steady-
state scheme on several spin qubits in parallel could pro-
vide deterministic inputs to such a distillation procedure.
In this work, we have focused on GaAs-based systems, as
these have been investigated most thoroughly in exper-
iments, with the ambient nuclei posing one of the dom-
inant sources of undesired noise. Two complementary
strategies to address the role of nuclear spins in future
studies would be (i) either to investigate nuclear-spin-
free systems with T ∗
2 > 100µs [47, 48] or (ii) to associate
the Heisenberg coupling (3) with the hyperﬁne interac-
tion between ancilla electron spins and collective nuclear
spin operators. Since nuclear spin ensembles typically
comprise 104 − 106 nuclei, this scheme could potentially
generate large amounts of entanglement over mesoscopi-
cally large distances.

I. ENTANGLEMENT OF FORMATION

The entanglement measure used in this work is the
entanglement of formation (EF ) [1], deﬁned as the mini-
mum average entanglement of an ensemble of pure states
that represents the mixed state ρ.
It quantiﬁes the
necessary resources to create a given entangled state.
For a mixed state ρ of two qubits the concurrence is
C = max{0, λ1 − λ2 − λ3 − λ4}, where λi are the square
roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix ρAρ∗A arranged in
decreasing order, where A is the antidiagonal matrix with
elements {−1, 1, 1,−1}. For two qubits it ranges from
0 (separable states) to 1 (maximally-entangled states).
The EF can be calculated from the concurrence as

II. CASCADED MASTER EQUATION FOR

ANCILLA SYSTEM

In Section II A we introduce the fermionic input-
output formalism [2] and apply it to “cascaded quan-
tum systems”, which consist of quantum nodes connected
through an ideal chiral reservoir. Then in Section II B
we employ the obtained cascaded master equation (ME)
to model the ancilla quantum dots (QDs) connected via
a quantum Hall edge (QHE) state as considered in the
main text.

A. Fermionic input-output formalism

First of all, we address the interaction of a system with
a Markovian reservoir of non-interacting fermions. The
total Hamiltonian has the generic system-Hamiltonian
HS, the bath Hamiltonian

HB =

dωωf†(ω)f (ω) ,

(2)

0

where ω is the bath energy and f (ω) are bath fermionic
annihilation operators with anticommutation relations

HSB = i

2π

where d is a fermionic annihilation operator acting on the
system and the coupling to the reservoir is assumed to be
independent of the frequency (Markov approximation).
The Heisenberg equation of motion of the bath operators
is

˙f (ω) = −iωf (ω) +

d ,

(4)

(cid:114) γ

2π

which can be formally integrated as

f (ω) = e−iωtf (ω, 0) +

(5)

(cid:114) γ

Here f (ω, 0) is the value of f (ω) at time t = 0. A general
system operator a may commute or anticommute with
the bath operators depending on its nature. We call it
even when it commutes with all bath operators and odd
when it anticommutes. The Heisenberg equation of mo-
tion is

an identity known as the input-output relation. Up to
this point, no assumption has been made concerning the
density operator of the bath. We will use the white
noise approximation which assumes the following corre-
lation functions for the input ﬁeld:
=
¯N δ (ω − ω(cid:48)) and
Here ¯N is the Fermi distribution function of a ther-
mal reservoir. Moreover we will assume a weak system-
reservoir coupling in the sense that the correlation func-
tions of the bath are not aﬀected by the interaction.

The input-output formalism provides a powerful treat-
ment for two or more subsystems sharing a common uni-

8

directional reservoir [3–5], also known as cascaded quan-
tum systems. Let us consider the case of two nodes cou-
pled to the reservoir via Eq. (3) with operators dj(j =
1, 2). Following the previous argument a system operator
of subsystem j, aj, follows the Eq. (7) with the change
d → dj, γ → γj and fin → f (j)
in . The fact that the reser-
voir is common and unidirectional implies a relation be-
tween the output of subsystem 1 and the input in 2. For
out(t − L/v), where
a dispersion-free channel f (2)
L is the distance between the two subsystems and v the
group velocity of the reservoir modes, i.e., all the out-
put of the ﬁrst subsystem is used later as the input into
the second one, therefore we are able to write a generic
equation for a odd (even) operator as [6]

Since the coupling operators d1,2 are fermionic annihila-
tion (odd) operators, they (anti)commute with any (odd)
even operator a of the other system. Then it is clear from
Eq. (10) that the time evolution of an operator of the sec-
ond subsystem depends on the ﬁrst one but not the other
way around, which reﬂects the unidirectionality condi-
tion. Following [4, 7], for a dispersionless channel, the
ﬁxed time-delay may be set to zero, i.e., one can choose
L/v = 0+ without loss of generality. The previous equa-
tion can be easily rewritten as

pression contains the non-local coherent and incoherent
contributions of the coupling between subsystems medi-
ated by the reservoir. For simplicity we have neglected
the spin index in this derivation. Moreover, in the main
text we work in a rotating frame such that the global
homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld drops out.
If the ancilla
dots energy levels are not aligned within γ, this would
generate an undesired rotation of the non-local terms in
Eq. (12) [6].

Once we have derived this quantum Langevin equation,
we can ﬁnd a ME for the partial density operator exclud-
ing the bath  by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom
from the total density operator W,  = trB {W}. For this
we make use of the relation tr{ ˙a(t)W} = tr
=
trs {a ˙(t)}. Since any physical state is fully described by
the expectation values of even observables (the odd ones
have vanishing expectation value due to the parity su-
perselection rule) we can restrict in Eq. (11) to the lower
sign for all observables of interest and end up with the

B. Ancilla quasi-steady state

The dynamics of the ancilla QDs connected via a QHE
state considered in the main text can be described by
Eq. (12). For simplicity, we restrict to the case γ ≡ γ1 =
γ2. Moreover, we consider the case of an empty channel
¯N = 0, we need to account explicitly for spins and we add
the contribution from the reservoir that pumps electrons
into the ﬁrst ancilla QD. Finally, if the spin-resolved lev-
els of the two ancilla QDs are aligned, the system Hamil-
tonian term vanish in a suitable rotating frame. There-
fore the dynamics of the ancilla dots is described by the

pute and analyze this steady quasi-steady state since it
will play a central role for the system dots ME to be
derived in Section III B. If a single spin component is in-
troduced, γL,↓ = 0 and γL ≡ γL,↑, the quasi-steady state
associated with Eq. (13) is

(14)

the quasi-steady state in Eq. (14) can be understood as
an equal-times state. However, this condition limits the
length of the edge channels to L < 1µm. For larger
separations (L/v (cid:29) 1/γ) we see that the ﬁrst QD is
driven into its steady state before the electrons that in-
teract with it have time to reach the second QD. Hence
we conclude that at any given time, QD1 and QD2 are
not entangled, instead, QD1 is getting entangled with
the bath (the electron modes in the channel connecting
the two QDs). That notwithstanding, as the cascaded
equation tells us, this system-bath entanglement is faith-
fully transported to QDs so that time-delayed measure-
ments at the two dots show strong quantum correlations.
If other quantum systems (like the system spins in our
setup) interact weakly with these two correlated ancillas
they are exposed to an non-local master equation that
can be eﬀectively taken as an equal-time equation if L/v
is short compared to the timescale of the qubit dynam-
ics, shown in Section III D to be on the order of J 2
0 /γ.
For realistic parameter values, we thus obtain a standard
equal-time entangled steady state for channel lengths of
up to a few tens of micrometers.

III. ADIABATIC ELIMINATION OF THE

ANCILLA SYSTEM

A. Adiabatic Elimination

The adiabatic elimination is an useful method when
one has a main system weakly coupled to an auxiliary sys-
tem, which undergoes fast dynamics (given by a Liouvil-
lian L0), since it allows to determine the eﬀective dynam-
ics of the main system to (in principle) arbitrary order in
the interaction [10]. Analogously to the Schrieﬀer-Wolﬀ
transformation for closed systems, it allows to decouple
the slow subspace, given by the steady state of the aux-
iliary system, i.e., L0ρss
a = 0 [11], from the fast one. To
this end, one deﬁnes the projector P by its action over the
total density matrix (DM) P = tra {} ⊗ ρss
a = ρ ⊗ ρss
a ,

Figure 1. Value of the diagonal elements of the ancilla steady-
state in Eq. (14) as a function of the ratio γL/γ.

The average populations of the ancilla dots depend on
the reservoir and channel rates as shown in Fig. 1.
For all γ, γL (cid:54)= 0 the quasi-steady state is entangled
(due to the Markovian coupling to the common channel)
and reaches an EF of ∼ 0.55 at γL = 2γ, at which point
the steady state is a mixture of the two-electron state
|↑,↑(cid:105) and the maximally entangled state |↑, 0(cid:105) − |0,↑(cid:105)
that is a “dark state” for the collective coupling via the
operator (d1,↑ +d2,↑) in Eq. (13). However, this entangle-
ment comes in a form of limited usefulness as it involves
a superposition of a single fermion in the ﬁrst or in the
second ancilla and due to fermionic superselection rules a
single such state (while entangled [8, 9]) cannot be distin-
guished from a separable state by local operations. Our
scheme shows that this entanglement can still provide
the quantum correlations necessary to produce an usable
spin-qubit entanglement for the system spins, which are
weakly coupled to this ancilla system.

In accordance with the cascaded nature of the system,
 in Eq. (13) takes into account a time delay between
systems 1 and 2.
If transport happens almost instan-
taneously even on the time-scale of the channel-ancilla
coupling (L/v (cid:28) 1/γ), the delay can be neglected and

over the auxiliary system ρ ≡ tra {}, and apply it to
the total ME of the form ˙ = (L0 + V) , where V is
the perturbative part.
In this way we can obtain the
subsequent orders of the eﬀective Liouville operator ex-
pansion that governs the dynamics of the main system
( ˙ρ = tra {Leﬀ}) [10]. Deﬁning the Laplace transform of
L0 as L−1

B. Eﬀective master equation for the system spins

In the following, we apply the method of adiabatic
elimination developed in Section III A to the physical
setup based on QHE states in order to eliminate the
ancilla coordinates and obtain an eﬀective ME for the
system spins. An electron occupying the ancilla dot j in-
teracts locally with the system spin Si via the Heisenberg
exchange interaction [12]

cilla operator; here, d
jσ creates an electron with spin
σ =↑,↓ in the ancilla dot j and τ is the vector of Pauli-
matrices. The complete interaction Hamiltonian is then
IN , which describes local spin-spin inter-
actions between ancilla and system dots. According to
Eq. (17), the generic ancilla operators An are σα
j , with
α = x, y, z and j = 1, ...4, and the system operators Sn
are Ji,jSα

According to Eq. (18) the ﬁrst order contributions are
given by the mean-value of the magnetic ﬁeld created by
the ancilla electrons in the quasi-steady state ρss

Following the intuition of spin-ﬂip processes between

(34)

the localized spins and the ancilla electrons, we expect
that a non-local term may dominate over all other pro-
cesses.
In Fig. 3 a) the diﬀerent rates contributing to
Eqs. (30) and (31) are shown as a function of the coupling
strength diﬀerence δJ, with J1(2) = J0 ∓ δJ. Clearly, the
rate Γﬀ
+ is found to dominate; however, other processes
may not be neglected completely. Note that we have
chosen the case of equal rates γL = γ for simplicity be-
cause it is close to the optimum working point. For this
particular case

C. Validity of adiabatic elimination

In the main text, we discuss to what extent the en-
tanglement of the localized spins inherent to the ideal
dynamics persists despite the undesired terms absorbed
into L(i)
n-id. These results are based on the previous adi-
abatic elimination of ancilla dots. To check the validity
of our perturbative treatment, in Fig. 5 we compare the

(i) We introduce an extra channel at the top with
electrons ﬂying in the opposite direction (from 4 to 3),
opposite spin polarization and with the following sym-
metry in the exchange couplings: J1 ≡ J1,1 = J2,4,
J2 ≡ J2,2 = J1,3. Summing up the ﬁrst order con-
tributions from the two channels, the Zeeman energies
necessary to cancel the ﬁrst order term are (see Eq. 24)
δ1(2) = ∓ (J1(cid:104)σz
2(cid:105)ss) (the index in parentheses
refers to the lower sign), which in the case of equal rates
become δ1(2) = ± J0+7δJ
(see Fig. 4a)). Zeeman energies
δi of the order of the coupling strengths Ji (i.e.
typi-
cally a few µeV) can be readily achieved (e.g., in GaAs
by magnetic ﬁelds of a few 100mT).

cross-correlations between the two channels. As the an-
cilla dot 4 (3) is symmetric to 1 (2), the correlations into
the same channel do not need to be computed again.
Since the ancilla quasi-steady state does not contain any
cross-channel correlations, non-local, cross-channel cor-
relators vanish (when one traces out the ancilla degrees

EF . Another important question is how long it approx-
imately takes for the system to reach this steady state.
This time is directly related to the spectral gap of the
corresponding dissipative dynamics, determined by the
eigenvalue of the Liouvillian with the largest real part
diﬀerent from zero, i.e.,  = − max{(cid:60)(λi)}, where λi are
the non-zero eigenvalues of the Liouvillian. We show this
quantity in Fig. 6 for the two proposals. Note that the
gap is proportional to J 2
0 /γ; therefore, we are interested
in the regime with small γ. However, the necessary condi-
tion to perform the adiabatic elimination needs to be also
fulﬁlled (J0 (cid:28) γ). For the valid parameters γ = 30µeV
and J0 = 3µeV, in the interesting parameter regime, i.e.,
where the maximum entanglement is generated , we es-
timate  ∼ 0.15µeV and  ∼ 0.03µeV, respectively. Ac-
cordingly, the steady state is reached on a timescale of
roughly ∼ (5 − 23)ns. These short typical times make
the proposals quite robust against noise sources, as can
be seen in Section V for the particular case of nuclear
dephasing.

Figure 5. Comparison of the results before (blue dots) and
after (orange line) adiabatic elimination of the ancilla QDs.
Proposal with a) two channels and b) one channel and coher-
ent driving. The ﬁgure depicts the EF of the steady state as
a function of δJ, with J0 = 3µeV and γL = γ = 30µeV.

entanglement in the steady state resulting from the full
ME including ancilla QDs to the Eqs. (36) and (38),
i.e., after adiabatic elimination. For the experimentally
achievable parameters γ = 30µeV and J0 = 3µeV the
agreement is very good, showing that the approxima-
tion is valid for physically achievable conditions and it
is possible to work with the simpliﬁed eﬀective ME for
the system spins. Obviously, the approximation becomes
less accurate for larger values of the coupling J0 respect
to γ (not shown).

D. Spectral gap

In the main text, as well as in Fig. 5, we have quanti-
ﬁed the entanglement of the steady state by means of the

IV. EFFECTIVE STROBOSCOPIC EVOLUTION

In this Section, we provide further details for the SAW-
based setup explained in the main text. The protocol
consists of a continuous train of mobile dots that inter-
act successively with the two system spins. The concate-
nated evolution of the localized spins DM is described

where ρ(n) deﬁnes the state of the system after the n-th
cycle of the protocol and the Liouvillian Li,n encodes the
interaction of the ancilla electron with the system spin
i and the Zeeman Hamiltonian (25). For Jiτj, δiτj (cid:28) 1,
we can perform a short-time Taylor expansion eLi,nτ =

Analogously to the two proposals of the QHE-based
setup, we consider (i) a protocol with alternating spin
directions and suitably synchronized exchange couplings

Both transport protocols drive the localized spins to an
entangled state independent of the initial state.

The ideal, analytical result given in Eq. (45) assumes

Note that for a direct comparison of Eqs. (45) and (47)
with a ME, one needs to assume inﬁnitesimal interaction
times, but we have conﬁrmed that the schemes work for

V. NOISE SOURCES

In this Section we detail the diﬀerent noise sources
taken into account in the proposed setups. First of all, we
account for qubit dephasing induced by nuclear spins in
the (GaAs) host environment. Secondly, we consider elec-
tron losses due to imperfections in the transport mech-
anisms. Finally, in the SAW-based proposal we account
for imperfections due to uncertainties in the eﬀective elec-
tron interaction times.

To account for dephasing due to the nuclear spins,
we follow the standard treatment [13] and assume that
the spins in the QDs experience non-Markovian noise.
The ﬂuctuations of the Overhauser ﬁeld lead to a time-
ensemble-averaged electron dephasing time T ∗
2 , that is
related to the width of the nuclear ﬁeld distribution σnuc
as T ∗
2/σnuc. In order to model this eﬀect, we have
to include the Hamiltonian [13–15]

Before we proceed, we note that, due to the sev-
eral time scales involved, our scheme should be very
amenable to the inclusion of dynamical decoupling tech-
niques, which allow for signiﬁcantly extended electron
coherence times, T2 ≈ 102T ∗

derived in Section III B. In Fig. 9 we plot the EF of
the steady state for diﬀerent values of the cooperativity-

tively. As expected from the analysis of the spectral gap
in Section III B, the purely dissipative proposal is typi-
cally found to be more robust. By choosing the values
γ = 30µeV and J0 = 3µeV we can predict that a value of
σnuc = 0.03, which corresponds then to a cooperativity
C = 10, would be very good concerning the purely dis-
sipative proposal. This standard deviation corresponds

associated with the uncertainty in the dwell times [17].
We include this noise source by choosing the times τi
randomly from a gaussian distribution centered around
the average (τ) with a standard deviation of στ . (iii) To
model the losses we assume during the time-simulation
that with a certain probability an ancilla spin never in-
teract with the second localized-spin.

In Fig. 11 we show the eﬀect of the diﬀerent noise
sources into the simulation in terms of EF of the state.
The convergence is found after ∼ 103 iterations, which
corresponds to the regime of (0.1 − 1)µs for τ = (0.1 −
1)ns. Note that if the product J0τ is ﬁxed, the results do
not change, but the time to reach the steady state and
consequently the undesired dephasing decrease with τ.
Once a small enough τ is ﬁxed, the result improves as J0
decreases but obviously the time grows and we need to
ﬁnd a compromise between the conditions τ J0 (cid:28) 1 and
a time suﬃciently short for the given nuclear dephasing
time.

The short dephasing times considered within the main
text force us to choose a quite large value of τ J0 =
0.38, therefore the amount of entanglement generated is
bounded to EF (cid:38) 0.4.
If the dephasing time reaches
the maximal experimental reported value of T ∗
2 = 3µs,
the amount of steady-state entanglement increases up to
EF (cid:38) 0.7, as shown in Fig. 12.

To model the possible electron losses due to imper-
fections in the transport channel, we include a Lindblad
operator with rate Γl acting in the ﬁrst ancilla QD, i.e,
4 in the two-channels proposal).
The result, shown in Fig. 10 predicts that we can aﬀord
a small percent of losses.

(2) Transport via SAW moving dots.— The approxi-
mated Eqs. (45) and (47) suggest that the simulation of
the full problem given in Eq. (40) will drive the main
qubits to an entangled steady state regardless of the ini-
tial state (as long as τ Ji (cid:28) 1). However, in a realis-
tic experimental situation, there will be also some noise
sources.
In the following, we account for: (i) Dephas-
ing due to the nuclear spins, (ii) imperfections due to the
uncertainty in the dwell-time τ (time jitter) and (iii) elec-
tron losses due to imperfections in the transport mech-
anism. (i) As explained above, we include a dephasing
Hamiltonian as in Eq. (48) to model the non-Markovian
noise due to the hyperﬁne interaction. We assume that
the ancilla dots are reﬁlled very quickly after every step
and thus neglect the evolution in the short intermittent
intervals when the ancilla dot is empty. (ii) In a realis-
tic experimental situation, there will be also some noise
