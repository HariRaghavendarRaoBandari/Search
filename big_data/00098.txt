Abstract

We evaluate the cosmogenic production rates in some materials that are commonly
used as targets and shielding/supporting components for detecting rare events. The
results from Geant4 simulations are compared with the calculations of ACTIVIA
and the available experimental data. We demonstrate that the production rates
from the Geant4-based simulations agree with the available data reasonably well.
As a result, we report that the cosmogenic production of several isotopes in various
materials can generate potential backgrounds for direct detection of dark matter
and neutrinoless double-beta decay.

Introduction

Evidence from galactic and extragalactic observations indicate the existence
of dark matter in our universe [1,2,3]. As a favored dark matter candidate,
the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) can be directly detected
by underground experiments through its elastic scattering oﬀ ordinary target

materials [4,5]. None of the current dark matter experiments has convincingly
observed WIMP scattering events. The next generation ton-scale dark mat-
ter experiments, especially the xenon-based detectors [6,7] are designed to
achieve ultra-low background conditions thus allowing detection sensitivity to
WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section down to ∼10−48 cm2. In order
to achieve such a sensitivity level, the background rate in the region of interest
needs to be at a maximum level of ∼0.1−0.2 events/ton-year [6].

Neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments are aimed at measuring the eﬀec-
tive Majorana mass of the electron neutrino down to 10 to 50 meV to under-
stand the nature (Dirac or Majorana) of neutrinos [8,9,10,11]. This requires
measurements of a half-life for a nucleus at a level of >1027 years. Existing
experiments have achieved [12,13,14] or will soon achieve [15] a sensitivity of
the order of 1025 years for several isotopes and set an upper limit on the ef-
fective Majorana mass of electron neutrino < 0.2 eV. Eventually, these future
experiments [12,13,15,16,17] target a sensitivity of > 1027 y or < 1 event/ton-
year in the region of interest to explore mass values favoured by both inverted
and normal mass ordering.

Such low-background event rates for both dark matter and neutrinoless double-
beta decay require the radioactivity level of every detector component to be
accurately measured. In addition to natural radioactivity, cosmogenic activa-
tion can add more radioactivity to a detector component. Mitigating measures
such as underground storage as early as possible can be employed, but accurate
activation calculations are needed to make decisions on design and operations.

In this paper, we evaluate cosmogenic production of radioactive isotopes at
sea level in various materials used for rare event experiments. The activation
rates are obtained using Geant4-based simulations [18] and the calculations of
ACTIVIA [19]. The results are compared with some experimental data [20,21].

2 Evaluation of cosmogenic production of radioactive isotopes on

the surface

2.1 Evaluation tools and input energy spectra

The Geant4 (V9.5p02)+Shielding modular physics list [22] is used for this
study. It includes a set of electromagnetic and hadronic physics processes re-
quired for high energy or underground detector simulations. For each physics
model, G4MuonNuclearProcess was activated to simulate muon-nuclear in-
elastic scattering.

2

The modiﬁed Gaisser’s formula [23,24] (Eq.(1)) is used to sample muons right
above the gas cylinder. The energy range spans 1 GeV to 100 TeV. The total
ﬂux is normalized to be 0.014 cm−2s−1, which is the total muon ﬂux corre-
sponding to the energy range from 1 GeV to 100 TeV on the surface [23]. The
stopping muons were not included in the simulation due to a much smaller
ﬂux.

For surface neutrons, the input energy spectrum of neutrons is shown in Fig. 1.
The neutron energy spectrum simulated by MCNPX code [25] is normalized
to the New York data (“NY data”) for neutrons with energy, En, greater
than 4 MeV [26]. This normalization allows us to calculate the total neutron
ﬂux and compare the result to the measured value [26,27]. Since cosmogenic
activation of materials is mainly through neutron capture and neutron inelas-
tic scattering processes and the latter requires a reaction threshold energy
to be usually greater than 4 MeV, we can divide neutrons into two energy
ranges: (1) thermal neutrons to fast neutrons with energy up to 4 MeV and
(2) fast neutrons with energy greater than 4 MeV. The energy spectrum for
the range of 1×10−8 MeV (thermal neutrons) to 4 MeV (fast neutrons) adopts
the results from MCNPX simulation [25] and its total ﬂux is normalized to be
0.002 cm−2s−1, which is the total neutron ﬂux for this energy range [25,26].
For fast neutrons with energy greater than 4 MeV, the measurements of “NY
data” [26] is used and its total ﬂux is normalized to be 0.004 cm−2s−1 [26]. It
is worth mentioning that the MeV neutron data may have a small contami-
nation from local radioactivity, which could slightly overestimate the neutron
rate from cosmic rays in that range. Below the cosmogenic activation rates
(atoms kg−1day−1) from the Geant4 simulation are reported according to the
production mechanisms - muon spallation, neutron capture (En<4 MeV), and
neutron inelastic scattering (En>4 MeV).

ACTIVIA [19] is a package that calculates cosmogenic production from cosmic-
ray activation using data tables and semi-empirical formulas. ACTIVIA uses
the neutron spectrum at the Earth surface shown by the blue curve in Fig. 1.
Since this blue curve, the default neutron energy spectrum in ACTIVIA, is
diﬀerent from the input energy spectrum used in the Geant4 simulation, we
also carried out ACTIVIA calculations using the neutron energy spectrum
from the “NY” data as in the Geant4 simulation, in order to evaluate any
diﬀerence between the two energy spectra. Therefore, “ACTIVIA1” stands for
ACTIVIA calculation results with the blue line as the input neutron energy
spectrum. “ACTIVIA2” represents ACTIVIA results with the red dots as its
input neutron energy spectrum. The overall diﬀerence in the neutron ﬂux is
about a factor of 3 between these two input fast neutron spectra. Note that
proton activation of materials is not included in the simulation because the

number of protons below a few GeV is less than the number of neutrons in the
atmosphere. The activation rate of materials from protons is expected to be
at least one order of magnitude smaller than that from neutrons. It is worth
mentioning that ACTIVIA does not deal with thermal neutron capture.

The variation of muon and neutron ﬂuxes as a function of altitude can be
described as [28]:

Ia = I0exp(

(A0 − Aa)

λ

),

(2)

where Ia is the ﬂux at a given altitude in meters, I0 is the ﬂux at the sea
level, A0 and Aa are the atmospheric thickness in g/cm2 for the sea level and
any given altitudes, λ is the average absorption length of particles in g/cm2 in
atmosphere. At the small altitudes, typical absorption lengths for muons and
neutrons are λµ = 520 g/cm2 and λn = 148 g/cm2 [28]. Fig. 2 shows relative
intensities as a function of altitude. As an example, the altitude of the surface
laboratory at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) is ∼1600
meters above sea level [20]. At this altitude, the muon ﬂux is a factor 1.41,

and the neutron ﬂux is a factor 3.34 higher than at sea level. To evaluate
cosmogenic activation rates at diﬀerent altitudes, the ﬂux correction factors
must be taken into account. The production rates are also dependent on the
energy spectrum of muons and neutrons, but in practice the correction of the
ﬂuxes is the dominant eﬀect. The variation in energy spectura of muons and
neutrons is small for altitudes lower than 2000 meters above sea level.

2.2 Cosmogenic production rates in xenon

Liquid xenon is widely used as a target material in dark matter and neutrino-
less double-beta decay experiments. It is generally sealed within gas cylinders
made of stainless steel for storage and transportation purposes. Although nat-
ural xenon is stable, it suﬀers from cosmic-ray bombardment at the Earth
surface. The cosmic rays produce radioactive xenon isotopes. The resulting
activity can be estimated from the exposure time of xenon to cosmic rays on
the surface since the time when xenon was produced.

A comprehensive Geant4 (V9.5p02) [18] simulation has been conducted to
evaluate the rate of xenon activation.

The xenon gas is assumed to be stored in a stainless steel cylinder that is 30.48
cm in diameter, 127 cm in height and 0.762 cm in thickness. The pressure of the
gas is set to be 970 psi gauge with a density of 0.3657 g/cm3 and temperature

5

Altitude (meters)10210310Relative Intensity11.522.533.544.55Relative Intensity:NeutronsMuonsof 20 ◦C. The total mass of the compressed gas is calculated to be 30 kg per
cylinder. The cosmic-ray muons and neutrons are considered as inputs shot
at a xenon gas cylinder. The cosmogenic production of xenon isotopes at the
surface is dominated by neutron inelastic interactions.

Impurities other than radioactive xenon in xenon target can be eliminated
by puriﬁcation. However, radioactive xenon isotopes generated by cosmogenic
activations cannot be removed during the puriﬁcation. Low-energy neutrons,
typically at thermal energies, activate target materials mainly through capture
processes. The dangerous neutron capture in xenon targets are: 126Xe(n,γ)127Xe,
132Xe(n,γ)133Xe, and 134Xe(n,γ)135Xe.

In contrast, high-energy neutrons or muons can break stable xenon nuclei
and convert them into radioactive isotopes, such as 127Xe, 133Xe, 135Xe, 125I,
129I, 121Te, 123Te, etc. Among these production processes, neutron inelas-
tic scattering reactions, 128Xe(n,2n)127Xe, 129Xe(n,3n)127Xe, 134Xe(n,2n)133Xe,
136Xe(n,2n)135Xe, dominate the production of radioactive xenon isotopes as
shown in Table 1.

In the Geant4-based simulation, we track the initial and secondary particles
to estimate the cosmogenic production rates. For a given input spectrum of
muons and neutrons, using a Geant4-based simulation and an ACTIVIA pack-
age, the cosmogenically activated isotopes and their corresponding production
rates are shown in Table 1. Results presented in columns 3 and 6 (the 2nd
value) were obtained with the same neutron spectrum from “NY data” above 4
MeV. The diﬀerence in the production rates is then mainly due to the cross sec-
tion libraries used in the Geant4-based simulation and ACTIVIA package. We
illustrate some of these diﬀerences in the cross sections for 128Xe(n,2n)127Xe,
129Xe(n,3n)127Xe, 134Xe(n,2n)133Xe in Figures 3, 4, 5. By default ACTIVIA
uses the semi-empirical cross sections from Silberberg and Tsao [30,31] but the
possibility to use a diﬀerent set of cross sections from MENDL libraries [35]
is foreseen although these cross sections are not provided with ACTIVIA.
We have not used MENDL libraries in this work. TENDL is a nuclear data
library used in the TALYS nuclear physics code. Geant4 uses a combina-
tion of the evaluated data libraries (ENDF/B−VII.0 [32], JEFF−3.1 [33],
JENDL−4.0 [34], etc), which have been converted into the Geant4 format.
As can be seen in Figures 3, 4, 5, the cross sections from Genat4 are similar
to the cross sections from TENDL. The cross sections from ACTIVIA are
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from Genat4 and TENDL.

2.3 Cosmogenic production rates in some key components of the rare event

physics experiments

Other than the xenon target itself, key materials, such as polytetraﬂuoroethy-
lene (PTFE), copper, titanium, and stainless steel, which are generally used
to build a detector, can also contribute to radioactivity. In the simulations, a
bulk cylinder of these materials is assumed with 10 cm in diameter and 10 cm
in height for evaluation.

PTFE is commonly used as an excellent reﬂector in experiments detecting
light from scintillations, for instance in liquid xenon detectors. Cosmic rays
can produce radioactive isotopes such as 7Be, 10Be and 14C in PTFE. The
simulated production rates are listed in Table 2. The diﬀerence in the pro-
duction rates between the Geant4 simulation and ACTIVIA2 caused by cross
sections ranges from a factor of 4 to 3000. However, the production diﬀerence
due to the diﬀerence in neutron ﬂux between ACTIVIA1 and ACTIVIA2 is
only about a factor of 2.

Oxygen-free high-conductivity copper (OFHC) or electroformed copper can
be made highly radiopure. The radiopure copper is commonly used as shield-
ing and structural material for low-background detectors. The concern for this
material when it is produced at the surface is the cosmogenically produced
isotopes such as 60Co, 57Co, 54Mn. The cosmogenic production rates for cop-
per are shown in Table 3. The diﬀerence in the production rates between the

Geant4 simulation and ACTIVIA2 caused by cross sections ranges from a fac-
tor of 1.05 (60Co) to 9 (44Ti). A good agreement between the Geant4 simulation
and ACTIVIA2 for the production of 60Co shown in Table 3 is not due to the
agreement in cross sections used in the two packages. In fact, the cross sections
for the main production channel, 63Cu(n,α)60Co, in Geant4 and ACTIVIA are
very diﬀerent as can be seen in Figure 6. The agreement on 60Co production
rate is then purely accidental. The diﬀerence in the production rates due to
the diﬀerent ﬂuxes between ACTIVIA1 and 2 is within a factor of 2, but not
very meaningful given the previous remark. Note that 60Co, produced through

63Cu(n,α)60Co, is a main concern for both direct detection of dark matter and
neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments because it has a long half-life (5.3
years) and emits two gamma rays (1.173 MeV and 1.333 MeV) with a summed
energy up to 2.506 MeV. These two gamma rays undergoing Compton scatter-
ing can generate background events in the region of interest for dark matter
experiments. Two gamma rays can summed up to 2.506 MeV energy, which
is in the region of interest for neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments.

Stainless steel is normally used to build detector vessels, or as a structural
material for low-background experiments [36,37]. Titanium was ﬁrst adopted
as a vessel material for liquid xenon by the LUX experiment [38] because a very
radiopure sample has been found. The simulated cosmogenic production rates
for stainless steel and titanium can be found in Table 4 and 5. As can be seen in
Table 4, there is a good agreement for the production rate of 46Sc between the
Geant4 simulation and ACTIVIA2 with the same neutron energy spectrum,
although as can be seen in Figure 7, the cross sections are diﬀerent by about
a factor 2. A factor of about 2 caused by the cross section diﬀerence is seen
in the production of 46Sc in stainless steel between the Geant4 simulation and
ACTIVIA2 (Table 5). Note that 46Sc with a half-life of 83.8 days is a concern
to dark matter experiments because it produces two simultaneous gamma rays
with energies 0.889 MeV and 1.121 MeV that can undergo Compton scattering
to generate background events in the region of interest. The production of 46Sc
in titanium is through 46Ti(n,p)46Sc and in stainless steel is via spallation
processes.

3 Comparison between calculations and the available experimental

data

As can be seen from Tables 1-5, the results from the calculations using AC-
TIVIA (with default cross sections from [30,31]) are inconsistent with the
simulated results from Geant4 for many isotopes. The inconsistencies can be
caused by (1) the neutron energy spectrum and (2) the library for cross sec-
tions of inelastic scattering processes. To understand which simulation tool
delivers more reliable results, we compared the Geant4 simulation results
with ACTIVIA as well as the available experimental data from LUX [20]

where R is the cosmogenic production rate in atoms per kg per day, Ts is the

of altitude is shown in Figure 2.

3.1 Comparison for the cosmogenic activity in natural xenon

The LUX [38] experiment reported the measured activity of 127Xe and 133Xe
utilizing their ﬁrst three months of data [20,38]. In this work, an exposure
time period of 150 days at sea level and appropriate exposures (7 to 49 days)
at an altitude of 1480 meters are applied according to information recorded
historically since the xenon gas bottles were produced [20]. Predicted and
observed decay rates are listed in Table 6 after 90 days underground.

The activation of xenon is also compared to the available data from XENON100 [21]
as shown in Table 7 in where the saturation activity at sea level is used. Note
that the saturation activity describes a saturation level at which its disinte-
gration rate equals its production rate and allows a fair comparison between
simulations/calculations and experimental data.

It is clear that the results for 127Xe and 133Xe from the Geant4 simulation
agree with the results from LUX and XENON100 reasonably well. However,
the results from ACTIVIA are diﬀerent from LUX and XENON100 by a factor
of more than 2 depending on the neutron ﬂux used in ACTIVIA. For example,
for the production of 127Xe, the diﬀerence between ACTIVIA1 and the LUX

14

data is a factor of 6.7 and the diﬀerence between ACTIVIA2 and the LUX
data is a factor of 2.7 with ACTIVIA2 calculations that used more accurate
neutron ﬂux. The diﬀerence of a factor of 2.7 between ACTIVIA2 and the
LUX data may come from the cross section libraries used in the calculation
of ACTIVIA2. We can conclude that the libraries for the cross sections of
neutron inelastic scattering in Geant4, at least, for the production of 127Xe
and 133Xe are adequate.

3.2 Comparison for the cosmogenic activity in natural titanium

Cosmogenic activation of natural titanium can produce a radioactive isotope
of 46Sc. We compare the results from the Geant4 simulation and ACTIVIA cal-
culations to the LUX data [20] in Table 8, using an exposure time of 180 days
for the titanium at 1480 meters altitude roughly equivalent to the LUX tita-
nium history. As can be seen in Table 8, both Geant4 simulation and ACTVIA
agree with the measured data reasonably well (<a factor of 2 diﬀerence). This
indicates that the cross section libraries used in Geant4 and ACTIVIA are
adequate for the production of 46Sc.

3.3 Comparison for the cosmogenic activity in natural copper

Cosmogenic activation of natural copper can generate dangerous radioactive
isotopes that can potentially produce background events in a rare event search
physics experiment. The results from a Geant4 simulation are compared to
ACTIVIA, Cosmo [21], TALYS [39], and the available data [21] as shown in
Table 9. The agreements between Geant4 and other calculations as well as the
measurements from XENON100 are within a factor of 2. One must point out
that even though ACTIVIA1 with the original neutron spectrum (blue line
in Fig. 1) shows better agreement with data than ACTIVIA2, this is not a
valid agreement as discussed previously in section 2.2 and Figure 6 because
the neutron spectrum used in ACTIVIA2 is more accurate based on the ﬁt to
the data.

3.4 Tritium production

3H, a long lived radioactive isotope (β decay), can be produced in all materials
through muon spallation and neutron inelastic scattering. In Table 10 we tab-
ulate the cosmogenic production rate of 3H in various targets from the Geant4
simulation and other available calculations. It is worth mentioning that the
production of 3H in germanium and NaI targets from Geant4 is slightly higher
than the earlier calculation using TALYS 1.0 [39]. A total of 42.87 kg−1d−1 in
NaI is consistent with a recent report of ∼40.6 kg−1d−1 [40] from ANAIS-25
as shown in Table 10. Aside from silicon, the agreement is good between the
Geant4 simulation and ACTIVIA2.

4 Cosmogenic and radiogenic production underground

Cosmogenic activation of materials in a underground environment can be es-
timated using the method described in Barker et al. [41]. Muon and muon-
induced neutron ﬂuxes are several orders of magnitude lower underground
than at surface. The cosmogenic production underground is therefore often
expected to be negligible. Since the radioactive isotopes in Tables 1-5 are
mainly induced by fast neutrons from cosmic rays, and there are fast neutrons
from natural radioactivity in any underground laboratory, we also evaluate ra-
diogenic production for the most important isotopes relevant to xenon-based
experiments. From the results of the simulations in Tables 1-5, the isotopes
with higher production rates, longer half-life, and emission of either low energy
X-rays/Auger electrons (127Xe) inside target or gamma rays with energies up
to MeV (46Sc and 60Co) in titanium or copper that are close to target, are
problematic. Thus, the main concerns are the production of 127Xe in xenon
gas, 46Sc in titanium, and 60Co in copper and stainless steel. To understand
the production rates underground, we use 127Xe as an example. The produc-
tion rate is 229 atoms kg−1d−1 on the surface with a fast neutron ﬂux (above 4
MeV) of 0.004 neutrons cm−2s−1. The capture process associated with thermal
neutrons contributes 0.64 atoms kg−1d−1 on the surface with a ﬂux of 0.002
neutrons cm−2s−1. We simulated the production rate for an underground lab-
oratory where the fast neutron ﬂux (En > 4 MeV) is about 10−6 neutrons
cm−2s−1 and the thermal neutron ﬂux is about 10−7 neutrons cm−2s−1 [42],
using Geant4 to estimate the production rate of radioactive isotopes under-
ground. We summarize the production rate of 127Xe at SURF, ∼1480 meters
below the surface [42,43]. Note that the calculation is performed for xenon gas
bottles without any shielding in the underground space.

• The possible maximum production rate from fast neutrons is less than
2.4×10−3 atoms kg−1d−1. This is because the dominant source of fast neu-
trons underground is neutrons from spontaneous ﬁssion resulting from nat-
ural radioactivity, with energy only up to 15 MeV.
• The possible production rate from thermal neutrons is about 7.5×10−5
• The possible production rate from cosmogenic activation through spallation

atoms kg−1d−1.
is estimated to be 7.1×10−4 atoms kg−1d−1.

The conclusion is that the production of 127Xe underground is about 3 atoms
per ton per day with a saturation activity of 3.5×10−5 Bq/ton. Since this is a
very low activity, we conclude that the radioactivity of these isotopes produced
underground can be negligible.

17

5 Conclusion

The cosmogenic activations of several key components of the next genera-
tion rare event search experiments at sea level have been simulated using
the GEANT4 and ACTIVIA packages. Fast neutrons, thermal neutrons and
muons at the Earth surface are considered individually. The total produc-
tion rates of several isotopes are compared with other calculations as well as
the available experimental data from LUX and XENON100. Signiﬁcant dif-
ferences are found in the results between Geant4 and ACTIVIA packages.
We attribute these diﬀerences to the diﬀerent input neutron energy spectra
and the cross-section libraries used in the two packages. From the comparison
between the simulated results and the available data for the production of cos-
mogenic radioactive isotopes, Geant4 simulation package is shown to provide
more reliable estimates.
