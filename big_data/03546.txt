ABSTRACT

Aims. CO ro-vibrational lines observed from Herbig group II discs are seen to be often broad while the same lines observed from
group I discs are often narrow. This diﬀerence is not well understood. In this paper we explore the underlying cause for this diﬀerence
and provide a pathway for a better understanding of the geometry and structure of the inner discs around Herbig Ae/Be stars.
Methods. High-spectral-resolution infrared spectra of CO ro-vibrational emission from six Herbig Ae/Be candidate stars were taken
with CRIRES (CRyogenic high-resolution InfraRed Echelle Spectrograph) at the VLT (Very Large Telescope). From these spectra,
we produce individual and co-added CO ro-vibrational line proﬁles. We investigate line proﬁle shape diﬀerences, and we explore the
FWHM (Full Width Half Maximum) variations with J quantum number in the context of disc geometry. Furthermore, we put our new
sources into the context of earlier observed sources to study a large sample. For comparison, we also investigate the FWHM variations
with J of modelled CO ro-vibrational lines from two typical disc geometries produced with the thermo-chemical disc modelling code
ProDiMo.
Results. For our new observations of CO ro-vibrational lines, we ﬁnd that the FWHM of individual lines range from 10-60 km/s. We
ﬁnd both narrow and broad single peaked emission lines, but only Hen 2-80 displays double peaked emission lines. For HD 250550,
the FWHM of the CO lines is increasing with J value, indicating a radially extended emitting region, while Hen 2-80 shows a
constant FWHM versus J behaviour, indicating a narrow emitting region. This qualitatively agrees with the two diﬀerent modelled
disc geometries. Comparing dust and gas inner disc geometries (inferred by SED and CO ro-vibrational emission) for the expanded
sample of observed Herbig discs, we ﬁnd no clear correspondence between the SED groups of the sources and their inner CO radius.
Conclusions. The FWHM versus J is a potential new gas diagnostic for the inner disc with e.g. a constant FWHM versus J indicating
the presence of a large gas hole or gap. Both models and observations indicate the potential of this new diagnostic. Our extended
sample does not fully support the previous trend where group I discs have CO ro-vibrational emission lines with small FWHM.
Instead, our CO ro-vibrational data from a handful of sources indicates diﬀerent inner disc geometries for gas and dust of these
sources.

1. Introduction

Infrared CO ro-vibrational emission lines are promising trac-
ers of the geometry and structure of the inner protoplanetary
discs. They are routinely detected in ground based observations
of discs around YSOs (Young Stellar Objects) and their line pro-
ﬁles reveal that they originate within a few tens of au from the
central star (Carr et al. 2001; Najita et al. 2003; Blake & Boogert
2004; Brittain et al. 2007; van der Plas et al. 2015), coinciding
with the region of planet formation.

It has been found empirically that Herbig Ae/Be stars show
two types of SEDs: Group I, displaying a rise in the mid-infrared,

(cid:63) Based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at

the La
Silla Paranal Observatory under programme ID 088.C-0898A and pro-
gramme ID 084.C-1002(A).

and group II with no rise (Meeus et al. 2001). Group I disks seem
to be dominated by large gaps and possibly depleted inner disks.
E.g. Maaskant et al. (2013) showed, using Q- and N-band imag-
ing and radiative transfer modelling for four HAeBe discs, clas-
siﬁed as group I from their SEDs, that all four required solutions
with a large dust gap separating the inner and outer discs. They
ﬁnally conclude that many, if not all, group I discs seem to have
gaps. Group II disks have more compact disks, with growing ev-
idence that gaps in the few to 10 au range are present (see e.g.
Menu et al. 2015).

CO ro-vibrational emission lines from Herbig discs have
been studied on several occasions. For example, a recent re-
analysis of CRIRES archival data by Banzatti & Pontoppidan
(2015) ﬁnd that Herbig star spectra show single component line
proﬁles, contrary to T Tauri spectra that often show two distinct

components. Observations do not always show symmetric dou-
ble peaked line proﬁles, instead ﬂat topped proﬁles, symmetric
or asymmetric single peaked proﬁles, proﬁles with shoulders or
other variations hereof have been observed (Blake & Boogert
2004; Brittain et al. 2007; Salyk et al. 2011; Hein Bertelsen et al.
2014; van der Plas et al. 2015). These shapes can occur if the pro-
ﬁle is a composite of CO emission coming from both the inner
and outer disc, if a disc wind is present (Bast et al. 2011; Pon-
toppidan et al. 2011) or if eccentricities are present in the disc.
However, ﬂat topped proﬁles can also be a result of low spec-
tral resolution, asymmetries can arise randomly in noisy proﬁles,
and non-Keplerian proﬁle shapes can arise from instrumental ef-
fects like slit loss (Hein Bertelsen et al. 2014). Keeping these
challenges in mind, the interpretation of CO ro-vibrational line
proﬁles from the HAeBe discs provide a powerful tool to trace
the disc geometry in planet forming environments.

van der Plas et al. (2015) were the ﬁrst to attempt to perform
a statistical analysis of CO ro-vibrational emission lines from
a larger sample of Herbig Ae/Be discs, including both group
I and group II sources. They found that the CO emission in
the discs, classiﬁed as group II from the SED, originates much
closer to the star than in the discs classiﬁed as group I from the
SED. Their sample included only four group I discs, limiting
general conclusions about the radial origin of CO emission in
these type of discs. Additionally, van der Plas et al. (2015) iden-
tify a correlation between the excitation mechanism for the CO
lines and group I/II classiﬁcation. The group I discs in the sam-
ple had a dominant ﬂuorescent excitation mechanism, indicated
by Tvib > Trot, and the group II discs had a dominant thermal
(LTE) excitation mechanism, indicated by Tvib ≤ Trot. From the
study by Brittain et al. (2007), UV ﬂuorescence is an important
excitation mechanism in dust-depleted discs, and Maaskant et al.
(2013) showed that all group I discs could in fact be discs with
gaps. The presence of a gap would ’force’ the various CO tran-
sitions to be emitted in a narrow region, similar for all J levels,
at the inner rim of the outer disc. This might cause the UV ﬂu-
orescence to become more important. An example of this is the
disc around HD 100546, where the CO ro-vibrational emission
starts at the inner wall of the outer disc and UV ﬂuorescence
is a dominant excitation mechanism (Brittain et al. 2013; Hein
Bertelsen et al. 2014). If we consider instead a continuous disc
without gaps, the CO transitions can be emitted from a broader
region (higher J closer to the star resulting in wider lines and
lower J lines dominated by emission from the outer regions re-
sulting in narrow lines) and allow for the possibility that thermal
excitation at small radii becomes more important. The sources
from van der Plas et al. (2015), that seem to require ﬂuorescence
from Tvib > Trot, are all sources with FWHM versus J constant.
Our new observations of CO ro-vibrational emission will ex-
pand the current sample of Herbig Ae/Be discs (especially group
I) and provide the basis for a better understanding of the geom-
etry and structure in the two types of HAeBe discs. This is key
in establishing the CO ro-vibrational lines as a tracer of planet
forming processes across stars of diﬀerent masses and evolution-
ary states. In Sect. 2 and 3 we present our sample and our new
observations. In Sect. 4 we describe the details of our data re-
duction and analysis methods and present our results. In Sect. 5
we discuss the overall trend for the CO emitting region and disc
geometry that can be derived from a large sample of observed
HAeBes (this paper, Salyk et al. 2011; van der Plas et al. 2015).
In Sect. 6 we present CO ro-vibrational emission from two mod-
elled disc geometries for the purpose of comparison, and in Sect.
7 we discuss, for both models and observations, the implications
of the FWHM versus J behaviour on the disc geometry and the

eﬀects of disc inclination. Finally in Sect. 8 we present our con-
clusions.

2. Sample
Our sample of sources was selected from the list of HAeBe can-
didates by The et al. (1994). Preference in the target selection
was given to Meeus et al. group I targets, as these stars were un-
der represented in previous studies of CO emission from HAeBe
discs. An overview of our sample is shown in Table 1 and back-
ground details of the individual sources are discussed in the
appendix A. Extinction-corrected SEDs of all stars were con-
structed from the literature and are shown in Fig. 1. The sources
have been given a rough classiﬁcation based on their position in
a diagram of near-infrared over total infrared luminosity versus
IRAS [12]-[60] colour similar to that in van Boekel et al. (2005)
(Fig. A.1 in the appendix). With the exception of HD 163296,
which is close to the boundary line between the two groups, and
T Ori, (due to a lack of IRAS data for this source) all stars in our
sample fall within the area occupied by group I discs.

3. Observations
High resolution spectra of 10 sources were obtained on March 5
and March 6, 2012, with the VLT cryogenic high-resolution in-
frared echelle spectrograph (CRIRES, Kaeuﬂ et al. 2004). Four
of these sources (Hen 2-14, Hen 3-1386, Th 35-101, V883 Ori)
have been rejected as Herbig Ae/Be stars on the basis of a care-
ful literature review and are therefore not discussed further in
this paper. A more detailed discussion of these sources can be
found in Hein Bertelsen (Ph.D. thesis 2015). For each target, the
wavelength region from 4.5 µm to 5 µm was covered using 3 or 6
diﬀerent grating settings (4.6575, 4.7363 and 4.9948 µm and the
additional three settings 4.6376, 4.8219, and 5.0087 µm). The
observations were made through a slit with a width of 0.2" and
the telescope was nodded by 10" along the slit for every other ex-
posure to subtract the sky emission. Since the CO ro-vibrational
lines also arise in the earth’s atmosphere, we chose the observa-
tions to be made in a period of time where the velocity shift of
our individual targets would be as large as possible for most of
the targets. Furthermore, we observed nearby telluric standard
stars directly after or before each target to remove the telluric
absorption lines. Flat ﬁelds were collected during the daytime
(within 12 hours of the science observations). See Table 2 for
the summary of the observations.

4. Data reduction and analysis
The science data were reduced using version 2.2.1 of the
CRIRES data reduction pipeline1. The observations were done
in nodding mode: The spectra are nodded between two positions
(A and B) 10" apart on the sky in the pattern ABBA so that
the source is in diﬀerent positions on the chip. The sky emis-
sion was removed by subtracting the nodded A and B spectra.
One dimensional spectra were extracted at each grating setting
for each individual source. The optimal extraction method2 was
used. The spectra of the telluric standard stars were reduced in
the same way. The telluric standard star spectra were divided
by a corresponding stellar atmosphere model of Kurucz (includ-
ing line opacities) to determine the instrument response function

and atmospheric transmission curve. The optical depth of the tel-
luric lines was then scaled to the depth of the science target and
small adjustments in the wavelength were applied when needed.
These adjustments in optical depth and wavelength are done by
minimising the telluric residuals. This corrects for the small dif-
ferences in wavelength calibration and atmospheric parameters
between the science spectrum and the telluric standard. As a last
step in the data reduction process, the science spectra were di-
vided by the response function of the corresponding standard
star (examples of the ﬁnal telluric corrected science spectra can
be seen in Figures B.1 and B.2 in the appendix).

4.1. Flux calibration

We have calibrated the continuum level of our sources to the cor-
responding spectroscopic standard (the collected telluric stan-
dards). For the standard stars we have collected the W2 magni-
tudes (λc=4.60 µm) from the WISE all-sky catalogue, HR6527
(mM=2.050±0.103 mag), HR4730 (mM=1.671±0.025 mag) and,
HR2421 (mM=1.521±0.037 mag). From this, the continuum ﬂux
at 4.6 µm of the three standard stars is respectively, 25.83 Jy,
36.62 Jy and 42.05 Jy. There are small diﬀerences in the widths
of the PSF for the science spectra and the telluric standard spec-
tra (we expect these diﬀerences to be due to variations in the
performance of the AO system). We do not correct for these dif-
ferences but note here that the error expected from this in our ﬂux

calibration is <10%. Furthermore, when viewing the full spectra
for each source there are inconsistent variations in continuum
level in diﬀerent wavelength settings (or detectors) for overlap-
ping or neighbouring regions. These variations are at the 10%
level. We apply ﬂux shifts to the frames where this is needed to
make the full spectrum ﬁt one consistent continuum curve.

4.2. Line detection

All of our observed sources have clear detections of H i recombi-
nation lines in emission: Pfund β 7-5 and the Humphreys  11-6
line. For these lines individual line proﬁles are displayed in Fig.
B.3 in the appendix. The full width half maxima (FWHM), the
line centres and the derived doppler shifts, together with the 3 σ
error bars are shown for all sources in Table B.1 in the appendix.
Spectra from four of our sources (HD 163296, HD 250550,
Hen 2-80, Hen 3-1227) also show clear detections of CO ro-
vibrational emission lines. The CO emission from these four
sources is not spatially resolved (for more details on spatially re-
solving emission with CRIRES see van der Plas et al. 2015). CO
ro-vibrational emission lines could also be present in MWC 137.
The spectrum shows, what looks to be, many wide and often
blended emission lines.

For the four sources with CO detections, individual CO lines
were identiﬁed and extracted using wavelengths from Chandra
et al. (1996). For each source certain wavelength settings over-

lap, resulting in a few lines being detected twice. Furthermore,
in the cases of Hen 2-80 and Hen 3-1227 we have collected ob-
servations during two nights with the same wavelength settings.
These doubly collected lines can be used for sanity checks and
uncertainty estimates. For the further analysis we consider our
line selection carefully: Some lines are contaminated by telluric
residuals and some lines are blended and cannot be separated for
individual proﬁle extraction. We thus manually select the best
uncontaminated and unblended lines for further analysis (Table
C.1).

4.3. CO line proﬁles

The CO ro-vibrational lines selected for analysis, are listed in
Table C.1 (and shown in the appendix Figs. C.1 to C.4). To quan-
tify the line shape variations for each source, we show plots
of FWHM versus Jup in Fig. 2. The FWHM plotted here is
the FWHM of the ﬁtted Gaussian. A Gaussian does not always
match the detailed line shapes well (however, a good line shape
match is obtained in all cases except Hen 2-80), but is a good and
consistent measurement of the width because the entire line pro-
ﬁle is evaluated to derive a FWHM. A manual measurement of
the FWHM, would be dependent on personal choice of the max-
imum location and hence diﬃcult to reproduce. For HD 250550,
we ﬁt a two component Gaussian (a central main component and
a smaller blue shifted component) due to the presence of a shoul-
der on the blue side of the proﬁle. The FWHM values in Fig. 2
are those from the main Gaussian. We do not show the FWHM
of the secondary component since we are interested in emission

R. P. Hein Bertelsen et al.: A proposed new diagnostic for Herbig disc geometry

from the disc and the origin of the secondary component is un-
known.

The error bars in Fig. 2, for all sources, are based on the
variation in FWHM when shifting the continuum by using the
standard deviation of the nearby continuum (for each line). The
Gaussian overestimates the error for the FWHM of Hen 2-80.
For Hen 3-1227, the error is underestimated due to the very nar-
row and peaky shape of the Gaussian.

From the FWHM versus J plots, we see that only the lines
from HD 163296 and HD 250550, show diﬀerences in line pro-
ﬁle shape through the line samples. To asses whether a corre-
lation between FWHM and J-value is present for any of the
sources, we have used the ASURV (Astronomy SURvival anal-
ysis) code (Isobe et al. 1986), to perform Kendall’s Tau test for
each CO detected source. For HD 250550 we found a probability
below 10−4 that a correlation is not present (even if we disregard
the three high J lines a correlation is still highly probable) while
the other three sources (HD 163296, Hen 2-80, and Hen 3-1227)
show probabilities of 70%-84% that a correlation is not present.
Thus, there is a very strong correlation between FWHM and J-
value in the data from HD 250550.

In Fig. 3, we show the medians of the v=1-0 lines from each
source. For HD 250550, splitting high and low J into two sep-
arate medians is useful since the FWHM increases with J. For
HD 163296, the FWHM does not have a clear correlation with
J, however, the shape of the single peak is asymmetric for high J
lines, while symmetric for low J lines. Hence, even though there
is no signiﬁcant change of the FWHM over J (within error bars
or as shown by the Kendall’s Tau test), we also split the high and
low J into two separate medians for HD 163296. For the last two
sources (Hen 2-80 and Hen 3-1227) high and low J medians do
not show any signiﬁcant diﬀerences, instead separate medians
(including all J) from the two observation nights are shown. In
Table 3 we show the FWHM results from the line proﬁle analy-
sis and in Tables C.2 to C.8 in the appendix we show line luxes
for all the collected lines.

5. Discussion of the observational sample
5.1. CO emitting region and disc classiﬁcation
Table 4 presents an overview of observed properties from the
discs in our sample, the discs in the sample by van der Plas et al.
(2015) and discs from Salyk et al. (2011).

A trend discussed by van der Plas et al. (2015), is the ten-
dency for group II discs to be emitting CO ro-vibrational emis-
sion from the dust sublimation radius (wide proﬁles) and group
I discs to be emitting from much further out (narrow proﬁles).
To explore this trend, we plot in Fig. 4 the RCO10% versus the
30/13.5 µm continuum ﬂux for the sources listed in Table 4. The
F30/13.5 ratio measures the MIR excess slope seen in the SEDs
and separates discs that are classiﬁed as group I or group II into
two regions. Group I discs are seen to fall above the F30/13.5=2.1
limit while discs classiﬁed as group II are seen to fall below this
limit (Maaskant et al. 2014; Acke et al. 2010). This scheme is in
agreement with the classiﬁcation from the LNIR/LIR versus [12]-
[60] colour diagram but we only have the F30/F13.5 ratio for
two of our observed sources (HD 163296 and HD 250550). The
reason we use the F30/F13.5 ratio here (instead of the LNIR/LIR
versus [12]-[60] colour diagram) is that it oﬀers us a simple way
to display in one diagram the comparison between group I/group
II classiﬁcation and inner radius of the CO ro-vibrational emit-
ting region. RCO10% is an estimate for where the onset of the CO
emission is located; it is derived from the half width at 10% of

the maximum (HW10M) in the median line proﬁles

RCO10% =

G · M∗
HW10M2 sin2i

.

(1)

Here G is the gravitational constant, M∗ is the stellar mass, and
i is the inclination of the disc. The HW10M are calculated from
the Gaussian ﬁts. If we exclusively consider the van der Plas
sample, there was indeed a sharp jump in radii for the onset
of CO emission (with only one exception, HD 135344B) when
comparing group I and group II discs (left and right of the dashed
line in Fig. 4). Considering now also the new sources from our
own sample and those from Salyk et al. (2011), the previously
found sharp jump disappears. Three more sources (four in to-
tal) with CO emitting regions close to the star, fall in the regime
of discs classiﬁed as group I from the SED. Thus, comparing
a larger sample of sources (e.g. Salyk et al. 2011; van der Plas
et al. 2015, and this paper) leads to a much more diverse picture
from these discs than seen from a smaller sample, the van der
Plas et al. (2015) sample alone. The distribution of group I and II
sources over RCO10% is very similar except for the three sources
with RCO10% > 6 au. These are interestingly the three sources for
which van der Plas et al. (2015) ﬁnd ﬂuorescence from the vi-
brational CO temperatures being much larger than the rotational
ones (Tvib (cid:29) Trot).
Discs whose gas diagnostics do not correlate with their SED
group classiﬁcation, could be discs where the radial dust and
gas distribution diﬀer. Such cases have been noticed before.
Fedele et al. (2008) found evidence of discs ﬂared in the gas,
but self-shadowed in the dust when comparing [O i] emission,
and 10 µm dust emission (vertically diﬀerent distribution of dust
and gas). Brown et al. (2009) resolved dust gaps in three discs
(HD 135344B, LkHα 330, SR 21N) with continuum observa-
tions (880 µm), while gas observations (CO, 4.7 µm) show gas
still present in the inner regions of the same discs. Furthermore,
PAHs are observed from within dust gaps (Maaskant et al. 2014)
and ALMA observations also reveal gas in dust depleted regions
(e.g. Casassus et al. 2013; Bruderer et al. 2014). The presence
or absence of a dust gap cannot necessarily be deduced from the
SED alone (see e.g. RY Tau, Isella et al. 2010), hence, imaging
data could be useful to help clarify the geometry of the dust in
the inner disc. In addition, comparisons between SED and gas
lines from other sources that seem to show dust/gas radial de-
coupling could also add to our understanding.

5.2. Silicate features and disc geometry
In the following, we compare the inner dust radii based on SED
classiﬁcation with those found for the CO ro-vibrational emis-
sion. In Table 4, we identify six sources where these two do
not agree. Five group I sources show CO ro-vibrational transi-
tions emitted from close to the star (< 2 au, smaller than typical
group I dust gap/hole sizes), and one group II source shows CO
emission from 4.2 au, which is well beyond the dust condensa-
tion radius.

Out of the ﬁve group I sources which show RCO10% < 2 au,
three are labeled group Ia and one is labeled group Ib. Group Ia
sources display emission features due to amorphous and crys-
talline silicates in their mid-infrared spectra whereas group Ib
sources do not have these features. Group II sources are in this
context all labeled group IIa since they all have silicate features.
Thus, three of the sources that are inconsistent in SED classiﬁ-
cation and onset radii for CO show a prominent silicate feature.
Maaskant et al. (2013) and Khalaﬁnejad et al. (2015) showed
that the presence of large gaps or holes in the inner discs will

on the plots. In the middle and bottom row FWHM collected for Hen 2-80 and Hen 3-1227 are shown for March 5, 2012 (left) and March 6,
2012 (right). The error bars are based on the variation that occurs in the FWHM when using the standard deviation of the nearby continuum as
uncertainty for the continuum placement when ﬁtting a Gaussian (in a few cases, where lines are very narrow, this approach leads to errors smaller
than the plotting symbols).

the lower two rows (for Hen 2-80 and Hen 3-1227), we show medians for all J collected on two separate nights: March 5, 2012 on the left, March

icate features (group Ib SED). c) A disc with a small hole and
silicate features present (group Ia SED). d) A disc where the ra-
dial dust and gas distribution diﬀers (group I SED). Depending
on the size of the dust hole, silicate features may or may not be
present.

In the general view, group I sources with broad CO lines de-
tected could be interpreted in one of two ways: 1) These discs
have small dust+gas gaps/holes meaning that silicate features
should be detectable and that CO lines are emitted from the
disc wall beyond the small gap/hole (sketch c in Fig. 5). 2)
These discs have gaps/holes only in the dust and therefore dis-
play group I behaviour in the SED, while CO lines are emitted
from inside the dust gap. The dust and gas are in this case dis-
tributed diﬀerently (sketch d in Fig 5). HD 250550, AB Aur and
MWC 758 (all group Ia sources) are consistent with interpreta-
tion number one, since they have silicate features present. For
Hen 2-80, the presence of the silicate feature is unknown. For
this source both interpretations are possible. Observations of the
silicate feature would thus be very helpful to place this object
into the above suggested scheme. HD 135344B, however, is la-
beled as a group Ib source and thus has no silicate features, im-
plying that the dust gap is large. Thus, the onset of CO emission
close to the star seems to require gas to be present within the
large gap (30 au, Maaskant et al. 2013), and interpretation num-
ber two is more likely here. Meanwhile, Carmona et al. (2014)
recently constrained the structure of this disc with modelling,
using multi-wavelength gas and dust observations, and indeed
concluded that the CO emission originates inside the gap.
HD 98922 is the only group II source with CO emitted fur-
ther out than expected, ∼4.2+4−2 au. However, considering the high
luminosity of the central star (∼890 L(cid:12)) the inner dust rim could
be further out than typically seen for group II sources, consistent
with the onset of the CO emission. Unless the gas surface density
is strongly depleted (CO column densities NCO < 1015 cm−2),
CO can survive the harsh UV radiation ﬁeld of the star, because
the dissociating bands become optically thick. For example, CO
bandhead emission at 2.3 µm is frequently seen in the inner discs
(inside 10 au) of young massive stars with L∗ > 103 L(cid:12) (e.g. Ilee
et al. 2014). However, the interpretation based on the high lumi-
nosity hinges on the distance which is not well determined; in
addition, HD 98922 could also be a spectroscopic double-star
(Blondel & Djie 2006). Gaia should clarify this issue soon.

6. Modelling
To support the discussion of the link between disc geometry and
FWHM of the CO ro-vibrational lines, we explore modelled CO

Fig. 4. RCO10% versus the 30 µm over 13.5 µm continuum ﬂux, from this
study (black), together with those from studies by van der Plas et al.
(2015) (red) and Salyk et al. (2011) (blue). Group I discs are plotted as
ﬁlled squares while group II discs are plotted as open squares.

cause these silicate features to disappear. Consequently the pres-
ence of a prominent silicate component observed from group
Ia sources could indicate a gap/hole small enough to keep the
dust at temperatures required for the silicate emission feature.
HD 100546 and HD 179218 are two group Ia sources with a con-
ﬁrmed gap and a detection of the silicate feature. In HD 100546
that feature arises from the wall at 10-13 au; in HD 179218, the
inner radius of the outer disk component is ∼ 15 au (Fedele
et al. 2008). On the other hand Khalaﬁnejad et al. (2015) found a
very weak tentative detection of silicate emission features from
HD 100453, thus a source on the border of a group Ia/Ib identiﬁ-
cation. This disc has a larger gap of ∼17 au and thus lower tem-
peratures (T ∼160 K) in the inner regions of the outer disc. The
distance of the inner wall of the outer disc can thus be critical
for the presence of a silicate feature, or turned around, the pres-
ence or absence of this feature may distinguish between small
and large dust gaps/holes in group I sources. We use the above
discussion to devise from the SEDs and RCO10% in the following
paragraphs a ﬁnite set of possible inner disk geometries.

In Fig. 5, we sketch four possible inner disc geometries and
link them to the SEDs: a) A no hole disc with silicate features
present (group IIa SED). b) A disc with a large hole and no sil-

Notes. See Fig. 6 for the gas density distribution of the two models.

The ﬁrst model is a ﬂaring disc without a gap (Model #1): We
run ProDiMo on top of a previously published MCMax model
that was ﬁtted to the Q- and N-band images of the disc around
HD 97048 (Maaskant et al. 2013). In that study Maaskant et al.
(2013) modelled a series of discs without and with gaps of vary-
ing size to asses the need for gaps to match the observed SED
and images. Model #1 is a ProDiMo model run on top of the
continuous disc model (no gap) from Maaskant et al. (2013), and
with the PAH (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) abundance
set to fPAH=0.7.

The second model is a ﬂaring disc with a gap from 4-13 au
(Model #2): We use a previously published model computed for
the disc around HD 100546 (Thi et al. 2011; Hein Bertelsen et al.
2014). This is a ProDiMo model on top of an MCFOST dust
model (Tatulli et al. 2011; Benisty et al. 2010) constrained by the
observed SED and near- and mid- infrared interferometric data.
For this disc, UV ﬂuorescence has been identiﬁed as the domi-
nant excitation mechanism, and the CO ro-vibrational emission
starts at the outer disc wall. The gas density distributions for both
models are shown in Fig. 6, and their key parameters are listed in
Table 5. For more details on the two models, see Maaskant et al.
(2013) and Hein Bertelsen et al. (2014).

7. A comparison of models and observations
7.1. FWHM versus J
To investigate the FWHM versus J behaviour for the CO ro-
vibrational lines in diﬀerent disc types, we use the two modelled
examples of disc geometry. These two models show profoundly
diﬀerent FWHM versus J behaviour (Fig. 7). For model #1 (disc
without a gap), the FWHM grows steadily with J similar to the
behaviour observed for HD 250550. For model #2 (gap at 4-13
au), no J dependence is seen for the FWHM of the lines. The
width is constant for all transitions, indicating that the emission
is always coming from the same narrow region, similar to the be-
haviour observed for Hen 2-80. For both models we performed
tests, switching oﬀ the UV ﬂuorescence. There are no signiﬁcant
changes in line ﬂuxes for Model #1; thus, UV ﬂuorescence has
no impact on the line ﬂuxes in this modelled ﬂaring disc without
a gap. For Model #2, UV ﬂuorescence does have a large impact
on the line ﬂuxes of the higher v-bands (vu>1). This can be ex-
plained by the lack of CO gas at temperatures of thousands of
Kelvin (due to the lack of CO in the inner 10 au), which are
needed to excite CO to the higher v-bands via thermal excita-
tion. UV ﬂuorescent excitation, however, can occur at any gas
temperature. Thus, for the modelled disc with a gap, UV ﬂuo-
rescence is an important excitation mechanism. From these two
models, we see that UV ﬂuorescence does not always aﬀect line
ﬂuxes in ﬂaring discs. However, links between constant FWHM
versus J behaviour, the presence of a dust gap and the excitation
mechanism could be possible. This would be consistent with the

Fig. 5. A sketch of various possible disc geometries: a) A continuous
disc without a hole/gap, resulting in a group II SED with silicate fea-
tures and broad CO ro-vibrational lines emitted from close to the star.
b) A disc with a large hole, resulting in a group I SED without silicate
feature (group Ib) and with narrow CO ro-vibrational lines emitted from
the outer disc wall. c) A disc with a small hole, resulting in a group I
SED with silicate feature (group Ia) and with broad CO ro-vibrational
lines emitted from the outer disc wall (in this case close to the star). d)
A disc with a (small or large) dust hole, resulting in a group I SED (with
or without silicate features) and broad CO lines. The radial gas distribu-
tion diﬀers from that of the dust and the CO lines are thus emitted from
within the hole

ro-vibrational lines from two distinctly diﬀerent inner disc ge-
ometries (a disc with a gap and a disc without a gap) produced
from two pre-existing ProDiMo models (these two models are
presented as examples of geometries and are not meant to specif-
ically match any of the observed discs in our sample). With these
models we produce samples of CO ro-vibrational lines to ten-
tatively test the connection between inner disc geometry and
FWHM versus J behaviour.

ProDiMo is a thermo-chemical disc code that solves the
gas heating and cooling and the gas chemistry self-consistently
(Woitke et al. 2009). The two models are parametrized disc
structures originating from the radiative transfer codes MCFOST
(Pinte et al. 2006, 2009) and MCMax (Min et al. 2009).
MCFOST and MCMax are three dimensional Monte Carlo con-
tinuum radiative transfer codes that calculate the dust temper-
ature and continuum radiation ﬁeld in the disc. The coupling
between ProDiMo and MCFOST or MCMax is explained in
Woitke et al. (2010). To model the CO ro-vibrational lines with
ProDiMo we use the complete CO ro-vibrational molecular
model described in Thi et al. (2013).

UV ﬂuorescence can be an important excitation mechanism in
dust-depleted discs and the study of Maaskant et al. (2013) who
found evidence that discs classiﬁed from the SED as group I
might all be discs with gaps.

CO10%

We can split our sample of sources in Table 4 in half, if we
choose Rcrit
=1 au. Six out of eight sources with RCO10%>1 au
show constant FWHM versus J behaviour, while this is true only
for two out of eight sources with RCO10%<1 au. One of these two
sources is HD 163296 for which Blake & Boogert (2004) and
Salyk et al. (2011) ﬁnd strong proﬁle diﬀerences between low
and high J lines (single versus double peaked). Hein Bertelsen
et al. (2016) found from a comparison between NIRSPEC and
CRIRES spectra taken ten years apart possible variability related
to a disc wind component in the CO ro-vibrational line proﬁles;
this will aﬀect the FWHM measurements. The other source is
AB Aur, where the high J lines are systematically wider than
the low J lines, but within the error bars, the source is con-
sistent with a constant FWHM versus J behavior. Spectra with
higher S/N are needed to clarify this case. The two sources show-
ing increasing FWHM versus J while having RCO10%>1 au are
HD 98922 and HD 95881. The stellar luminosity of HD 98922
(log L = 2.95) can push the dust condensation radius much fur-
ther out than in normal Herbig discs (see Sect. 5.2). We conclude
that this trend in FWHM versus J bears additional diagnostic
value and we will investigate it further in an upcoming modeling
paper.

7.2. Disc inclination
The single peaked shape and the narrow FWHM of lines from
e.g. HD 250550 or Hen 3-1227 could be connected to a low incli-
nation of the discs. With Model #1, we tested the line behaviour
for diﬀerent inclinations. The vsep versus inclination behaviour
for a high and a low J modelled line is shown in Fig. 8. At low
inclination the peak separation drops below the instrument de-
tection limit and we would observe a single peak. In Fig. 7 we

furthermore see, that low inclination yields smaller FWHM and
an overall ﬂatter FWHM versus J behaviour. An inclination of
<35° could already produce single peaked line proﬁles for low
J lines, but the model indicates that an inclination of <20° is
necessary in order to also see the higher J lines as single peaks.
An inclination of this size is consistent with the inclination
assumed for HD 250550 by Fedele et al. (2011). However, at
such low inclinations, the FWHM of the lines in the model be-
come much smaller than observed for HD 250550 (Fig. 7). If
the single peaks from HD 250550 are due to low inclination,
the CO emission needs to onset very close to the star (with the
main contribution from this region), in order to be consistent
with the observed FWHM of 15-20 km/s. Model #1 has an ex-
tended emitting region for the CO, with ∼30% of the line ﬂux
coming from 20-70 au for low J lines, and ∼20% of the line
ﬂux coming from 20-50 au for high J lines. HD 250550 could
also have an extended emitting region since the FWHM versus
Jup behaviour shows a steady increase in FWHM with J level
just like the model (Fig. 7). In the model, this extended emitting
region means that the peak separation of low J lines becomes
quite narrow already at higher inclinations. Another explanation
for the single peaked line proﬁles could be the presence of a slow
molecular wind component in the line proﬁles (see e.g. Bast et al.
2011; Pontoppidan et al. 2011).

8. Conclusions
We have collected high-resolution IR spectra from six addi-
tional Herbig Ae/Be stars and have conﬁrmed detections of
CO ro-vibrational emission lines from four of these sources
(HD 163296, HD 250550, Hen 2-80, and Hen 3-1227).

For HD 250550, the FWHM of the CO lines is increasing
with J value, suggesting an extended emitting region that moves
closer to the star for higher J levels. Hen 2-80 shows a constant
FWHM versus J behaviour, suggesting that all transitions are
emitted from the same narrow region. Results from two mod-
elled disc geometries suggest a connection between dust gaps

consistent with the interpretation of group I discs as discs with
gaps (Maaskant et al. 2013).

Our observed sample together with previously observed
sources does not support the simple dichotomy where discs la-
beled group I from the SED have narrower CO ro-vibrational
emission lines, i.e. are emitting further out in the disc. Many
group I discs do have narrow proﬁles, but several exceptions
exist. We suggest that these exceptions might represent cases,
where either gas and dust are radially not co-spatial, or the gap
in the disc, responsible for the group I classiﬁcation, is small
(silicate features detected).

Further investigations, such as additional examples of ob-
served discs that show increasing FWHM versus J for the CO
ro-vibrational lines, complementary data from HD 250550 that
can reveal or exclude the presence of a dust gap, data to clarify
the inclination of HD 250550, and detailed modelling, are re-
quired to better understand both the trend of FWHM versus J
behaviour, its link with disc geometry (ﬂat, ﬂaring, gap, no gap)
and the suggested spatial decoupling of dust and gas (dust gap
versus dust+gas gap). The signiﬁcance of these mechanisms for
the appearance of the CO ro-vibrational lines will be investigated
in a modelling grid in a forthcoming paper.

in the inner disc and a constant FWHM versus J behaviour
(possibly connected to a dominant ﬂuorescent excitation mecha-
nism), while an increasing FWHM versus J behaviour could be
connected with a continuous disc without a gap (possibly con-
nected to a dominant thermal excitation mechanism). This could
eventually turn into an additional observational diagnostic. If the
FWHM increases steadily with J, the gas would be continuously
distributed in a disc reaching from the dust sublimation radius to
the maximum allowed by the excitation mechanism. Meanwhile,
if the FWHM stays constant and the line is fairly narrow, it could
suggest a gap/hole since large parts of the region, where the lines
normally originate are missing. Consequently the emitting area
becomes very small and the same for all lines. This would be

Appendix A: Observed sample

HD 163296

HD 163296 is a well studied Herbig Ae star of spectral type
A3Ve (Gray & Corbally 1998), with a protoplanetary disc. In
the LNIR/LIR versus [12]-[60] colour diagram it falls in the range
of group II discs (see Fig. A.1). This classiﬁcation is supported
by the lack of PAHs in its infrared spectrum (Acke & van den
Ancker 2004). However, HD 163296 has properties of both a
ﬂat and a ﬂaring discs, in particular a scattering disc is observed
(Grady et al. 2000) which is not expected for a self-shadowed
disc. Montesinos et al. (2009) estimated the stellar mass in the
system to M∗ ∼2.3 M(cid:12) and the age to 5 Myr. From spatially
resolved sub-mm data, Isella et al. (2007) estimated the disc
around HD 163296 to have an inclination of 46°±4° and a posi-
tion angle of 128°±4°. The disc is located at a distance of 119 pc
(Hipparcos). The disc has been observed in scattered light out to
a radius of ∼500 au (Grady et al. 2000).

The presence of a giant planet or brown dwarf orbiting in
the outer disc has been suggested by Grady et al. (2000), to
explain an annulus of reduced scattering around 325 au in the
optical choronagraphic images, from the Space Telescope Imag-
ing Spectrograph (STIS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
The reduced scattering is consistent with a cleared zone like that
caused by a substellar companion.

Isella et al. (2007) studied the disc with interferometric ob-
servations, from 0.87 to 7 mm, both in the continuum and of CO
emission lines. From these observations the 12CO and 13CO was
found to be optically thick. From the continuum dust emission
the authors found an outer radius of 200±15 au while CO lines
imply an outer radius of 550±50 au. The authors suggest that it
is necessary to introduce a sharp drop in continuum emission of
a factor >30 at a radius of 200 au, to explain the lack of contin-
uum emission from radii larger than 200 au. HD 163296 thereby
diﬀers from the standard transitional disc where it is the inner
disc that is dust depleted.
Recent ALMA band 7 data, at ∼850 µm, sets the outer dust
disc radius at 240 au and the CO outer radius at 575 au (de
Gregorio-Monsalvo et al. 2013). These observations show a well
resolved dusty disc and no suggestion of gaps or holes at R>25

neously. The CO channel maps require a thicker gas disc, while
the mid- and far-infrared SED require a ﬂatter dust disc than pre-
viously presented in Tilling et al. (2012).

HD 163296 shows variations

in NIR brightness on
timescales of years (Sitko et al. 2008). The source has a bipo-
lar jet (HH 409), discovered in choronagraphic images from the
STIS (Grady et al. 2000). The high velocity gas in the jet has
radial velocities of 200-300 km/s. Ellerbroek et al. (2014) found
that the jet displays periods of intensiﬁed outﬂow activity at reg-
ular intervals of 16.0±0.7 years. They also identify transient op-
tical fading, together with enhanced NIR excess, and conclude
that this is consistent with a scenario where dust clouds are
launched above the disc plane.

HD 250550

HD 250550 is a conﬁrmed Herbig Ae/Be star of spectral type
B8–A0IVe (Gray & Corbally 1998), with a protoplanetary disc.
The SED of HD 250550 is similar to that of HD 163296 and it
has a lack of PAHs in its infrared spectrum (Acke & van den
Ancker 2006). In our LNIR/LIR versus [12]-[60] colour diagram
this disc falls (on the group I side) close to line dividing group
I and group II discs (see Fig. A.1). In previous literature using
standard classiﬁcation methods it has been labeled as a group I
source (e.g. Acke & van den Ancker 2006; Fedele et al. 2011;
Maaskant et al. 2014), and in this paper we will thus consider
this a group I source. The central star has an estimated mass of
M∗ ∼3.6 M(cid:12) and age of 1 Myr (Martin et al. 2004). The object
is located at a distance of 280 pc (Canto et al. 1984; Kawamura
et al. 1998). In FUSE observations, emission lines from C iii and
O vi were detected (Bouret et al. 2003).

Hen 2-80 (SS73 34)

Hen 2-80 was recently conﬁrmed to be a Herbig Be star of spec-
tral type B6Ve (Carmona et al. 2010). In our LNIR/LIR versus
[12]-[60] colour diagram it falls clearly on the group I side (see
Fig. A.1). However, this is the earliest spectral type in our sam-
ple. In a study of discs around Herbig Be stars Verhoeﬀ et al.
(2012) concluded that generally the SEDs of Herbig Be stars do
not show ﬂaring geometries but rather indicate self-shadowed
geometries. In a study of photo evaporation of discs as a function
of stellar luminosity, Gorti & Hollenbach (2009) concluded that
hot luminous young stars should evaporate their outer discs on
relatively short timescales. In a simplistic view this would mean
that more luminous stars lose their outer disc fast and the chance
of seeing a ﬂaring disc around a massive pre main sequence star
is not very large.

Hen 2-80 is located at a distance larger than 750 pc (mini-
mum distance based on luminosity). Carmona et al. (2010) ob-
served the source using high-resolution spectroscopy in the op-
tical, covering the wavelength region 3500-9200 Å (R ∼45000).
The spectrum is ﬂat and exhibits only a few absorption lines.
The observed emission lines in the spectrum include Hα, He i
lines, Mg ii, H i P(17), O i, S ii, N ii, and Ca ii. Carmona et al.
(2010) published spectra of the Hα line showing narrow absorp-
tion centred on the line.

MWC 137
MWC137 was classiﬁed as a Herbig Be star of spectral type
B0ep (Sabbadin & Hamzaoglu 1981; Finkenzeller & Mundt
1984). The SED of MWC137 resembles that of a ﬂaring disc
around a Herbig Ae/Be star (see Fig 1), and it falls clearly on the
group I side in our LNIR/LIR versus [12]-[60] colour diagram (see
Fig. A.1). However, the listed luminosity (L∗>4.1) and eﬀective
temperature (Teﬀ=30000) are unexpectedly high for a Herbig
star and Esteban & Fernandez (1998) favoured it to be a B[e]
supergiant. Meanwhile, the N-band mid-IR spectrum published
by Verhoeﬀ et al. (2012) looks very similar to that of MWC297
which is believed to be a massive Herbig Be star.

MWC 137 is located at a distance larger than 1000 pc (min-
imum distance based on luminosity). The object appears to be
spectroscopically variable (Zickgraf 2003). An upper limit of
0.007 M(cid:12) for the disc mass has been found, using continuum
images at 1.4 and 2.7 mm from IRAM and at 1.3 and 0.7 cm
from the NRAO VLA (Fuente et al. 2003).

Verhoeﬀ et al. (2012) performed N-band imaging and long
slit spectroscopy with VISIR/VLT. They conclude that the ob-
served PAH emission originates both from a circumstellar disc
and from a surrounding nebula.

In a survey of massive evolved stars, including MWC 137,
Oksala et al. (2013) obtained K-band spectroscopic data with the
SINFONI at the VLT. Their observations of the ﬁrst overtone CO
band head emission is the ﬁrst detection of CO emission from
this source. 13CO emission was also detected. Their model sug-
gests that the CO emitting region is located in a detached disc
or ring structure and not in a continuous disc. Kraus (2009) note
that pre-main sequence levels of 13C should not produce visi-
ble 13CO band head emission. This lead Oksala et al. (2013) to
conclude from their 12CO/13CO band head ratio that MWC137
could be an evolved, post-main sequence object. Esteban & Fer-
nandez (1998) investigate the nebula (S 266) around MWC137,
using narrow-band Hα image and high resolution spectroscopy
and suggest it to be a ring nebula; in the continuum subtracted
Hα image, they see a clear ﬁlamentary shell structure and a
fainter and more diﬀuse emission ﬁlling its inner regions. The
classiﬁcation of this object remains uncertain, thus we consider
it a non-conﬁrmed Herbig-candidate.

T Ori
T Ori is a conﬁrmed Herbig Ae star of spectral type A3IVe (Mora
et al. 2001). T Ori has not been plotted in our LNIR/LIR ver-
sus [12]-[60] colour diagram, since the 12 and 60 micron data
for this source is contaminated by emission from nearby bright
sources. However, its SED appears typical of a self-shadowed or
ﬂat disc (see Fig. 1). This classiﬁcation is supported by the ab-
sence of PAH emission in the infrared spectrum of T Ori (Acke
& van den Ancker 2006). Furthermore, T Ori shows strong pho-
tometric variations in the optical of the type that is seen around
UX Orionis stars and in a modelling study by Dullemond et al.
(2003) it was shown that UXOR-type phenomenon should only
occur in self-shadowed discs. The star is located at a distance of
510 pc (de Zeeuw & Norris 1999) and is reported as a spectro-
scopic binary (Shevchenko & Vitrichenko 1994).

Hen 3-1227 (Hen 2-174, SS73 62, WRAY 15-1520)
Hen 3-1227 is a star of spectral type Be (Pereira et al. 2003).
It is located at a distance larger than 400 pc (minimum distance
based on luminosity). In our LNIR/LIR versus [12]-[60] colour

R. P. Hein Bertelsen et al.: A proposed new diagnostic for Herbig disc geometry

diagram (see Fig. A.1), Hen 3-1227 is located on the group I
side. However, the SED does not resemble a typical disc around
a Herbig star (neither group I nor group II).

This source has been studied in several surveys and was
classiﬁed as a possible planetary nebula (Webster 1966; Henize
1967). However, this classiﬁcation was later rejected by Sten-
holm & Acker (1987) and Acker et al. (1987). Its spectrum
shows only Hα, Hβ and [O i] (6300 Å) emission (Swings 1973).
Pereira et al. (2003) collected spectra from the ESO 1.52 m tele-
scope in La Silla (3500–7500 and 3100–5100Å) and reported
a continuum of a reddened Be star with Hα, Hβ, Hδ and [O i]
(6300 and 6363 Å) in emission and Hγ in absorption. Mirosh-
nichenko (2007) labels Hen 3-1227 as an FS CMa-type candi-
date, but the somewhat broad Balmer lines seen in the optical
spectra suggests a high surface gravity, which could indicate an
object close to the main sequence. The classiﬁcation remains un-
certain, but from the optical spectra we cannot exclude it as a
pre-main sequence object. As for MWC 137 we therefore also
consider Hen 3-1227 a non-conﬁrmed Herbig-candidate.

Appendix B: CRIRES spectra
Figures B.1 and B.2 show examples of the near infrared CRIRES
spectra from one of the six wavelength settings from all six
sources. The ﬁnal telluric corrected spectra are shown (black)
together with the original uncorrected spectra (blue) and the tel-
luric standard spectra (red). CO ro-vibrational and H i line iden-
tiﬁcations are indicated on the plots. Low transmission regions
in the ﬁnal corrected spectra are plotted as dotted red lines and
are ignored during line extraction. Fig. B.3 shows the H i lines
present in our spectra and Table B.1 shows the collected FWHM
and velocity shifts of these lines. In Fig. B.4, we show the line
proﬁle of the [OI] line at 6300 Å observed from Hen 2-80 by
Carmona et al. (2010), and in Fig. B.5 we show a VLT/UVES
spectrum from MWC 137 with a detection of the K i 7699 Å
line.

Notes. The FWHM, the line centres, and the velocity shift are found by
ﬁtting the proﬁles to a Gaussian. The error estimates are the three sigma
errors from the ﬁtting of the Gaussian. Large error bars, when present,
are due to the HI proﬁles being poorly approximated by a Gaussian
proﬁle.

Fig. B.3. The Humphreys  11-6 lines (left) and the Pfund β 7-5 lines (right) observed from our sample of stars. To avoid residual telluric features,
caused by the saturation of telluric emission lines, we show only those regions of the spectra with transmittance above 35%. The vertical red
dashed line is the location of the line centre. Target names are indicated on the ﬁgure.

Appendix C: Extracted line ﬂuxes and proﬁles
The individual CO ro-vibrational lines collected from the four
CO detected sources and selected for further analysis are listed
in Table C.1 and shown in Figures C.1 to C.4 together with a
median of all transitions at the bottom of each plot. In Fig. C.3,
we show also the low J, v=1-0 lines collected from Hen 2-80
with CO ro-vibrational absorption superposed. These were not
selected for the further analysis. For the selected lines, line ﬂuxes
where calculated and are presented in Tables C.2 to C.8. The line
selection approach is described in Sect. 4.2.

tent with the previous trend of group I discs emitting at smaller
radii. We ﬁnd single peaked emission lines for low and mid J val-
ues while ﬂat topped asymmetric proﬁles with shoulders seem to
be present at higher J. The scatter in the FWHM measurements,
are caused by low S/N and very wide lines with broad wings hard
to separate from the continuum. This scatter is reﬂected well in
the associated error bars, based on the standard deviation of the
nearby continuum. The line shapes that we observe are not com-
patible with the earlier line detections of Blake & Boogert (2004)
and Salyk et al. (2011) using NIRSPEC/Keck data (R ∼25000).
At low J, Blake & Boogert (2004) ﬁnd single peaked proﬁles
of similar shape as our observed proﬁles but much wider than
ours. For high J lines, Salyk et al. (2011) ﬁnd double peaked
and again much wider proﬁles than ours (for J>25, FWHM=83
km/s compared to our FWHM=59 km/s). If we can exclude the
instrumental setup as the cause for these proﬁle diﬀerences (the
earlier data were collected using NIRSPEC/Keck as opposed to
CRIRES/VLT), this could be connected to the reported varia-
tions in NIR brightness (Sitko et al. 2008; Ellerbroek et al. 2014).
An in depth study of our detected CO lines from this source, in-
cluding a thorough comparison to previous observations and to
a model, will be the topic of a forthcoming paper.

Appendix C.2: HD 250550

We include 12CO v=1-0 emission lines from J=1 up to J=35,
v=2-1 emission lines from J=6 up to J=20, 13CO v=1-0 emis-
sion lines from J=5 up to J=25 in our study. The v=1-0 lines
are single peaked with a blue shifted shoulder that seems to in-
crease for higher J. The noticed correlation between the FWHM
(of the main component) and J value (increasing FWHM, con-

ﬁrmed with the Kendall’s Tau test performed in Sect. 4.3) points
to a CO emitting region where lines of higher excitation are com-
ing from regions closer and closer to the star.

The lower J line median for HD 250550 shows a narrower
Gaussian proﬁle (FWHM=15km/s), with a shoulder at -17 km/s,
while the higher J line median shows a wider main component
(FWHM=20km/s), where the blue component has grown and
merged with the line wing of the main component.

The line shape of the 12CO v(1-0)R30 line is consistent with
that observed previously by Brittain et al. (2007). The average
FWHM and single peaked line shape of our detected lines is con-
sistent with the FWHM and line shape of the ro-vibrational OH
line at 2.9345 µm reported by Fedele et al. (2011). The single
peaked shape could be caused by low inclination of the disc and
based on their observations of the OH line Fedele et al. (2011)
conclude that a model with an inclination of 10° gives the best ﬁt.
The velocity resolution for CRIRES is 3 km/s, so double peaks
separated by ≤3 km/s could be observed as single peaks.

Appendix C.3: Hen 2-80
We include 12CO v=1-0 emission lines from J=5 up to J=36,
v=2-1 emission lines from J=0 to J=27, 13CO v=1-0 emission
lines from J=4 to J=27. These lines show broad, double peaked
proﬁles and the fact that the width and line shape stay similar
through all J values (see Figures 2 and 3) indicates a similar
emitting region for all lines. One of the causes for a similar emit-
ting region could be the presence of a gap which would be con-
sistent with the classiﬁcation, from the LNIR/LIR versus [12]-[60]
colour, of the source as group I. The width of the lines, however,

is not consistent with this classiﬁcation. The peak separations for
the observed lines are also fairly large (∼22-25 km/s), indicating
that the CO emitting region is not very extended and/or that the
disc has an inclination far from face on.

We also detect 12CO v=1-0 J<6 lines but these coincide with
CO ro-vibrational absorption lines (Fig. C.3). These absorption
lines are perfectly centred on the emission lines and their origin
could likely be in the reported surrounding nebulosity (Carmona
et al. 2010).

Appendix C.4: Hen 3-1227

We include 12CO v=1-0 emission lines from J=0 to J=26 and
13CO v=1-0 emission lines from J=4 to J=23. All lines are
weak, narrow, and single peaked. This could be due to a low
inclination angle of the disc. However, we cannot conﬁrm a pro-
toplanetary disc nature for this object (see Sect. 2). The lack of
full J coverage, together with the scatter (due to low S/N) in the
FWHM values makes it hard to determine whether the FWHM
is constant or rising with J (Fig. 2). However, the FWHM values
are not inconsistent with a constant FWHM versus J behaviour.

Appendix C.5: MWC 137

We see broad and blended emission lines over the entire spec-
trum. The crowded spectrum does not arise from a poorly cho-
sen standard star spectrum for the telluric correction, since the
same spectrum was used for the correction of T Ori, a source
that shows a mostly ﬂat spectrum. We have clear detections of
the H i recombination lines and of CO absorption v=1-0 from
lower J levels (Jup=0,1,2,3,4). For the CO absorption lines, the
lowest J (Jup=0,1) transitions are seen as narrow double-peaked
or multicomponent lines with separation of 12 km/s. A high-
resolution VLT/UVES optical spectrum of MWC 137 extracted
from the ESO data archive (see Fig. B.5 in the appendix), also
shows multiple absorption components in the K i 7699 Å line,
with the same velocity separation as seen in the CO absorp-
tion lines. Therefore, we interpret the CO absorption seen in our
spectra of MWC 137 as being due to the presence of cool molec-

ular material in multiple absorbing foreground clouds. The broad
blended emission features present throughout the spectrum could
be blended CO ro-vibrational lines, since no other molecule has
been reported to produce such strong and numerous emission in
this particular wavelength region. Similar spectra has been ob-
served from other discs, e.g. RW Aur by Najita et al. (2003),
who show that blended very broad CO ro-vibrational lines can
explain the observed spectrum, and HD 101412 by van der Plas
et al. (2015), where ﬁrst overtone CO emission was also seen,
similar to MWC 137 (Oksala et al. 2013).

Appendix C.6: T Ori
For T Ori no CO emission lines were found in the spectra (Fig-
ures B.1 and B.2). The spectrum shows a somewhat ﬂat and
sometimes ’bumpy’ continuum. In the previous study (van der
Plas et al. 2015), CO fundamental lines were detected from a
similar source, HD 190073 (group II classiﬁcation and spec-
tral type A2IVpe). The line ﬂuxes for the v=1-0 lines from
this source range from 1.4±0.6·10−14 to 3.3±1.3·10−14 erg/cm2/s
(van der Plas et al. 2015). Scaled to the distance of T Ori (i.e.
1.7 times further away), we would expect typical ﬂux levels be-
low ∼ 10−14 erg/cm2/s. This is of the same order as some of
the weakest lines (v=2-1 or 13CO) we detect in sources such
as HD 250550 and Hen 3-1227. However, the detected lines in
these two sources were narrow and sharply peaked and were
therefore easier to separate from the continuum. For T Ori, being
a group II source, we expect emission lines to be wider (emitted
closer to the star) and therefore more diﬃcult to separate from
the continuum in the case of weak lines. Thus, the observed ﬂat
spectrum we see from T Ori is consistent with the expectation of
broad and weak emission lines with line ﬂuxes below the detec-
tion limit.

A similar explanation is also valid for the v=2-1 and for the
13CO lines from HD 163296. These lines, though still visible in
the spectra, are too broad and weak to be quantiﬁed. The v=1-0
lines, detected from HD 163296, are also very wide but strong
enough (10−13 erg/cm2/s) that they can be separated from the
continuum.
