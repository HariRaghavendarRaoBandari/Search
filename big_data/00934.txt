Abstract

In topological quantum materials1–4 the conduction and valence bands are connected

at points (Dirac/Weyl semimetals) or along lines (Line Node semimetals) in the mo-

mentum space. Numbers of studies demonstrated that several materials are indeed

Dirac/Weyl semimetals5–9. However, there is still no experimental conﬁrmation of

materials with line nodes, in which the Dirac nodes form closed loops in the mo-

mentum space2,4. Here we report the discovery of a novel topological structure -

Dirac node arcs - in the ultrahigh magnetoresistive material PtSn4 using laser-based

angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data and density functional the-

ory (DFT) calculations. Unlike the closed loops of line nodes, the Dirac node arc

structure resembles the Dirac dispersion in graphene10 that is extended along one

dimension in momentum space and conﬁned by band gaps on either end. We propose

that this reported Dirac node arc structure is a novel topological state that provides

a novel platform for studying the exotic properties of Dirac Fermions.

The discovery of non-trivial surface states in topological insulators1 attracted a lot of

interest and initiated quests for novel diverse topological states in condensed matter. Topo-

logical nodal states with conduction and valence bands touching at points (Dirac/Weyl

semimetals) or lines (Line Node semimetals) have been proposed to exist in multilayer

heterostructures2,3. A possible extension of these states to three dimensional (3D) single

crystals was proposed in β-cristobalite BiO2

11 and A3Bi (A = Na, K, Rb)12, which are

thought to host bulk 3D Dirac points protected by crystal symmetry. Subsequently, Na3Bi
and Cd3As2 were experimentally demonstrated to be 3D Dirac semimetals5,6,13–17. Subse-
quently, another type of massless particle - Weyl Fermion18 - was found in states that were

predicted to exist in a family of non-centrosymmetric transition metal TaAs, TaP, NbP and

NbAs19,20. These materials were conﬁrmed as Weyl semimetals by reports of Fermi arc states

connecting the Weyl points as a unique signature7–9. While experimental evidence supports

existence of Dirac semimetals and Weyl semimetals, clear signatures of semimetals with line

nodes are yet to be discovered. Several groups proposed that line node structures may exist

in graphene networks21, rare earth monopnictides22, antiperovskite Cu3PdN/Cu3ZnN23,24,
27 and CaAgX(X = P, As)28, but so far no direct evidence was

reported. A few ARPES studies in PbTaSe2

29 and ZrSiS30 presented some evidence of the

existence of Dirac-like features and “drumhead” surface states, but further research is still

needed to understand fully their signiﬁcance and relation to Dirac line nodes.

Many topological nodal semimetals such as Cd3As2

31, NbP32, WTe2

33 exhibit extremely

large magnetoresistance. Prior to these discoveries, a similar eﬀect was observed in PtSn4
with magnetoresistance of (cid:39) 5 × 105 % and no obvious saturation at 1.8K and 140 kOe34.
However, the band structure of this material has not been studied experimentally in detail

due to very complex Fermi surface (FS) revealed by calculations34. Here we demonstrate

that, despite its quite complex FS in the center region of the Brillouin zone, there are also

very interesting features close to boundary of the zone, i.e., the Z and X points, which are

the signatures of a topological quantum material. Whereas most of the topological quantum

materials were predicted by theory ﬁrst and veriﬁed by experiment later, we present an

opposite approach: we focused on ultrahigh non-saturating magnetoresistance and based on

this we searched for topological states in PtSn4 by using ultrahigh resolution ARPES and

followed with band-structure calculations.

Brillouin Zone (BZ) for PtSn4 are shown in Fig.1. Panel (b) shows the ARPES intensity

integrated within 10 meV of the chemical potential. High intensity areas mark the contours

of the FS sheets. The FS consists of at least one large electron pocket at the center of

BZ surrounded by several other electron and hole FS sheets, consistent with the quantum

oscillation result34. Fig.1c shows the calculated bulk FS, which matches the data well close

to the center of the zone and Z point in Fig.1b and it is also consistent with the calculated

FS using full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW) within local density

approximation (LDA)34. However, it does not predict the FS crossings close to the X point,

missing a set of nearly parallel FS sheets that are present in Fig.1b. On the other hand, these

experimental features are well reproduced by calculation of surface states using slab method;

results of which are shown in Fig.1d. Band dispersion along several cuts in proximity of

Z and X points are shown in Fig.1e - l. Close to Z point (Figs.1e & g), the dispersion

resembles a Dirac-like feature, but the intensity within band contour points to bulk origin

and it is consistent with corresponding band calculations shown in Figs.1f, h. Close to X

point (Figs.1i & k), the band dispersion is also Dirac-like, but very sharp, thus more likely to

be due to surface states; moreover, it is consistent with the slab calculation shown in Figs.1j,

l. The data in Fig.1 demonstrates that the experimentally observed band structure has both

bulk and surface components. The former dominate the Fermi surface close to the Z point,

and the latter is prominent close to the X point. The linear dispersion and gapless band

crossings strongly suggest that both bulk and surface features at the edge of the Brillouin

zone may have topological character possibly linked to ultrahigh magnetoresistance similar

In Fig.2 we focus on the interesting features near the Z point in more detail. Fig.2b shows

an enlarged image from the red box in Fig.2a, where two triangular- shaped FS sheets are

observed. Figs.2c - j show the detailed evolution of band dispersions along cuts#1 to #8.
A sharp linear dispersion starts to cross at binding energy of ∼200 meV in Fig.2c and the
Dirac point moves up in energy in Figs.2d - 2g and ﬁnally reaches the Fermi level in Fig.2h,

as indicated by red arrows. Then, the Dirac point moves up above the Fermi level and

becomes a sharp, shallow hole pocket in Figs.2g - 2j. This movement of the Dirac nodes

forms a line in the Energy-Momentum space in the proximity of Z.

Whereas the behavior described above has previously been predicted by theory, the struc-

ture in the proximity of the X point is far more interesting. We now examine the Fermi

surface and band dispersion in small area in the part of the Brillouin zone that is marked

by the red box in Fig.3a. The Fermi surface in this region consists of a short arc along

the the symmetry line and two longer, nearly parallel segments on either side of this arc.

Detailed band dispersion along cuts#1 to #12 are shown in Figs.3c - n. The data along cut

#1 shows Dirac-like dispersion, with the top and bottom bands merging at a single gapless

point. The band is very sharp, consistent with its surface origin. As we move closer to the

X point, two things happen: a gap develops between top and bottom bands and both top

and bottom bands split into two parts symmetric about the kz = 0 line (Figs.3d - f ). Before

reaching the X point, the gap vanishes and there are two gapless Dirac-like features in close

proximity of X point. The inner bands of the two Dirac features merge along symmetry line

and form the arc at the chemical potential visible in Fig.3b. The two gapless, Dirac-like

and kx = 1.05π/a. Outside of this momentum range a gap develops separating the upper

and lower portion of the band. This gives rise to two arcs of Dirac nodes located at binding
energy of ∼ 60 meV, which we named Dirac node arcs.

We now proceed to demonstrate that the Dirac-like dispersion shown in Fig.3 is gapless

by plotting the momentum-dispersion curves (MDCs) and energy-dispersion curves (EDCs).

Fig.4c shows the EDC extracted along the red dashed line in 4b. The red arrow marks the

peak located at roughly 90 meV below the Fermi level (Fig.4a), and demonstrates the

absence of an energy gap in this single Dirac-like feature. In Fig.4d, we show the double

Dirac-like features along cut#8(Fig.3j). The EDCs shown in 4f are extracted along the

red-dashed lines marked as 1, 2, 3 in Fig.4e. The red arrows in Fig.4e and Fig.4f mark

location of the peaks at binding energy of 60 meV, and show the gapless nature of these

dispersions. The surface-state calculation using 42-layer slab shows that the conduction and

valence bands are separated by roughly 23 meV in the single Dirac feature. However, further

increase in the layer number would dramatically reduces the gap size, as shown in Fig.4h.

To better illustrate the Dirac node arc structure, we plot the location of the Dirac nodes in

the momentum space in Fig.4i by extracting the peak positions of MDCs at each node (i.e.,

at the binding energy of 90 meV in the single Dirac dispersion and 60 meV at the proximity

of X point in the double Dirac dispersion, as marked by the red-dashed lines in Fig.4a and

d). In Fig.4j, the schematic of the double Dirac node arc structure is shown, with two Dirac

dispersion extending along one-dimension in momentum space.

In conclusion, we use ultrahigh resolution tunable VUV laser-based ARPES to measure

the Fermi surface and band dispersion of PtSn4. The most signiﬁcant result is the discovery

of Dirac node arc structure in this material. Our results show that near the X point,

the single Dirac dispersion evolves into two gapped dispersions and, before reaching the

X point, the gaps close and two gapless Dirac-like feature emerge extending along one

dimension in momentum space, forming Dirac node arc. These novel features diﬀer from

previously predicted Dirac line nodes that form closed loops in momentum space. We

proposed that this novel topological nodal structure could be an ideal platform for studying

the exotic properties of Dirac Fermions. Finally, we note that, most of the recently discovered

ultrahigh magnetoresistive materials31–33 seem to also possess Dirac or Weyl features in the

band dispersions6,9,35,36. As we have demonstrated, this opens an avenue for discovering and

identifying novel topological states and relativistic behavior based on rudimentary transport

measurements.

METHODS

Sample growth Single crystals of PtSn4 were grown out of a Sn-rich binary melt37. The

constituent elements, with an initial stoichiometry of Pt0.04Sn0.96, were placed in an alumina

crucible and sealed in a quartz tube under a partial Ar pressure. After the quartz ampoule
was heated up to 600 ◦C, the ampoule was cooled down to 350 ◦C over 60 h34. In order to
decant the Sn readily at this temperature, a frit-disc crucible was used38.

Sample preparation and measurements ARPES measurements were carried out

using a laboratory-based system consisting of a Scienta R8000 electron analyzer and a a

tunable VUV laser light source39. The data were acquired using a tunable VUV laser

ARPES system, consisting of a Scienta R8000 electron analyzer, picosecond Ti:Sapphire

oscillator and fourth harmaonic generator. All Data were collected with a constant photon
energy of 6.7 eV. Momentum and energy resolution were set at ∼ 0.005 ˚A−1 and 2 meV.
The size of the photon beam on the sample was ∼30 µm. Samples were cleaved in situ at
a base presure lower than 1 × 10−10 Torr. Samples were cooled using a closed cycle He-
refrigerator and the sample temperature was measured using a silicon-diode sensor mounted

on the sample holder. The energy corresponding to the chemical potential was determinded

from the Fermi edge of a polycrystalline Au reference in electrical contact with the sample.

Samples were cleave at 40K and were kept at the cleaving temperature throughout the

measurement.

Calculation method Density functional theory40,41 (DFT) calculations have been done

in VASP42,43 using PBE44 exchange-correlation functional, plane-wave basis set with pro-

jected augmented waves45 and spin-orbital coupling (SOC) eﬀect included. For bulk band

structure of PtSn4, we use the conventional orthorhombic cell of 20 atoms with a Monkhorst-
Pack46 (8 × 6 × 8) k-point mesh. For surface band structure, we use slabs up to 96 atomic
layers or 320 atoms with a (8 × 1 × 8) k-point mesh and at least a 12 ˚A vacuum. The
kinetic energy cutoﬀ is 230 eV. The convergence with respect to k-point mesh was carefully

checked, with total energy converged, e.g., well below 1 meV/atom. We use experimental
lattice parameters47 of a = 6.418˚A, b = 11.366˚A and c = 6.384˚A with atoms ﬁxed in their

8

bulk positions.
