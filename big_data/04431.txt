A REMARK ON ANALYTIC FREDHOLM ALTERNATIVE

L. GOLINSKII AND S. KUPIN

Abstract. We apply a recent result of Borichev–Golinskii–Kupin on the Blasch-
ke-type conditions for zeros of analytic functions on the complex plane with a
cut along the positive semi-axis to the problem of the eigenvalues distribution
of the Fredholm-type analytic operator-valued functions.

Introduction and main results

The goal of this note is to reﬁne partially (for a certain range of parameters)
a recent result of R. Frank [5, Theorem 3.1] on some quantitative aspects of the
analytic Fredholm alternative. Precisely, the problem concerns the distribution of
eigenvalues of ﬁnite type of an operator-valued function W (·) = I + T (·), analytic
on a domain Ω of the complex plane. We always assume that T ∈ S∞, the set of
compact operators on the Hilbert space. A number λ0 ∈ Ω is called an eigenvalue
of ﬁnite type of W if ker W (λ0) 6= {0}, (i.e., −1 is an eigenvalue of T (λ0)), if W (λ0)
is Fredholm (that is, both dim ker W (λ0) and codim ran W (λ0) are ﬁnite), and if
W is invertible in some punctured neighborhood of λ0. The function W admits the
following expansion at any eigenvalue of ﬁnite type, see [6, Theorem XI.8.1],

W (λ) = E(λ)(P0 + (λ − λ0)k1 P1 + . . . + (λ − λ0)kl Pl)G(λ),

where P1, . . . , Pl are mutually disjoint projections of rank one, P0 = I −P1 −. . .−Pl,
k1 ≤ . . . ≤ kl are positive integers, and E, G are analytic operator-valued functions,
deﬁned and invertible in some neighborhood of λ0. The number

ν(λ0, W ) := k1 + . . . + kl

is usually referred to as an algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue λ0.

The following result, Theorem 3.1, is a cornerstone of the paper [5]. By {λj} we
always denote the eigenvalues of W = I + T of ﬁnite type, repeated accordingly to
their algebraic multiplicity.

Theorem A. Let T (·) be an analytic operator-valued function on the domain Ω =
C\R+, so that T ∈ Sp, p ≥ 1, the set of the Schatten–von Neumann operators of
order p. Assume that for all λ ∈ C\R+

Here C is a generic positive constant which depends on p, ρ, σ, ε, ε′.

The similar results for ρ = 0 are also available.
The proof of this result is based on the identiﬁcation of the eigenvalues of ﬁ-
nite type of W with the zeros of certain scalar analytic functions, known as the
regularized determinants

f (λ) := detp(I + T (λ)),

see [7, 9] for their deﬁnition and basic properties. The point is that the set
of eigenvalues of ﬁnite type of W agrees with the zero set of f , and moreover,
ν(λ0, W ) = µf (λ0), the multiplicity of zero of f at λ0 (see [5, Lemma 3.2] for the
rigorous proof). Thereby, the problem is reduced to the study of the zero distri-
butions of certain analytic functions, the latter being a classical topic of complex
analysis going back to Jensen [8] and Blaschke [1].

A key ingredient of the proof in [5] is a result of [2, Theorem 0.2] on the Blaschke-
type conditions for zeros of analytic functions in the unit disk which can grow at
the direction of certain (ﬁnite) subsets of the unit circle. In a recent manuscript
[3] some new such conditions on zeros of analytic functions in the unit disk and
on some other domains, including the complex plane with a cut along the positive
semi-axis, are suggested. Here is a particular case of [3, Theorem 4.5] which seems
relevant. We use a convenient shortening

{u}c,ε := (u− − 1 + ε)+ − min(c, u+),

c ≥ 0, ε > 0, u = u+ − u− ∈ R.

Theorem B. Let h be an analytic function on Ω = C\R+, |h(−1)| = 1, subject to
the growth condition

log |h(λ)| ≤

Let Z(h) be its zero set, counting multiplicities (the divisor of h). Denote

Then for each ε > 0 there is a positive number C which depends on all parameters
involved such that the following inequality holds

s := 3a − 2b + 2r.

We are aimed at proving the results, which reﬁne Theorem A for a certain range

of parameters, by using Theorem B.

Theorem 0.1. Let T (·) be an analytic operator-valued function on the domain
Ω = C\R+, which satisﬁes the hypothesis of Theorem A. Assume that

that is, (0.6) is stronger than (0.2) with regard to eigenvalues tending to zero.
Theorem B gives the same results, (0.2) and (0.3), as in Theorem A, for the rest of
the values of ρ and σ, and the eigenvalues tending to inﬁnity.

1. Proof of main results

Proof of Theorem 0.1.
We follow the line of reasoning from [5]. The scaling T1(λ) := T (M 1/(ρ+σ) λ) looks
reasonable, so

kT1(λ)kp ≤

1

d ρ(λ, R+) |λ|σ ,

and, by [9, Theorem 9.2, (b)], we have for the determinant f1 = detp(I + T1)

(1.1)

log |f1(λ)| ≤

Γp

d pρ(λ, R+) |λ|pσ ,

λ ∈ C\R+.

To apply Theorem B we have to ensure the normalization condition. Note that
the function T1 tends to zero along the left semi-axis as long as ρ + σ > 0, so the
inequality (see [9, Theorem 9.2, (c)])

(1.2)

|f1(λ) − 1| ≤ ϕ(kT1(λ)kp), ϕ(t) := t exp(cid:0)Γp(t + 1)p(cid:1),

t ≥ 0,

holds with a suitable constant Γp which depends only on p, and provides a lower
bound for f1 whenever the right side is small enough. We have for t ≥ 1 and
λ = −t ∈ R−

|f1(−t) − 1| ≤

C1
tρ+σ ,

4

(in the sequel Ck stand for generic positive constants depending on the parameters
involved). If t ≥ (2C1)1/(ρ+σ) = C2, then |f1(−t)| ≥ 1/2, and so

(1.3)

log |f1(−t)| ≥ −2(1 − |f1(−t)|) ≥ −

2C1
tρ+σ .

Next, put

(1.4)

h(λ) :=

f1(tl)
f1(−t)

,

h(−1) = 1.

It follows from (1.1) and (1.3) that for t ≥ C2

log |h(λ)| = log |f1(tl)| − log |f1(−t)| ≤

Γp
tρ+σ

a = pρ,

r = pσ,

b = p(ρ + σ), K =

and s = a, {s}a,ε = −a. In view of (0.5) one has 2r + a = p(ρ + 2σ) ≤ 0, so

{−2r − a}a,ε = − min(a, −2r − a) = 2r + a = pρ + 2pσ,

(recall that, by the assumption, a > −2r − a). Hence

s1 =

2pσ − 1 − ε

2

,

s2 = pρ + pσ + 1 + ε,

and (0.4) implies

d pρ+1+ε(z, R+)

or

tρ+σ .

For |ζ| ≤ 1 we ﬁx t, say, t = C2, and since t + |ζ| ≤ C2 + 1, we come to

Xζ∈Z(f1)∩¯D

d pρ+1+ε(ζ, R+) |ζ|pσ− 1+ε

2 ≤ C5,

which, after scaling, is (0.6). The proof is complete.

✷

Proof of Theorem 0.2.
The idea is much the same with the only technical diﬀerences. In the above notation
relation (1.1) still holds, and the function T1 tends to zero as t → 0− whenever
ρ + σ < 0. So

(1.5)

log |f1(−t)| ≥ −2(1 − |f1(−t)|) ≥ −

For the function h (1.4) we now have

2C1
tρ+σ = −2C1t|ρ+σ| ,

0 < t ≤ C2.

log |h(λ)| ≤ C3t|ρ+σ| (cid:18)

1

d pρ(λ, R+) |λ|pσ + 1(cid:19) ,

and as

d pρ(λ, R+) |λ|pσ + 1 ≤

|λ|p|σ| + |λ|pρ
d pρ(λ, R+)

≤ |λ|pρ (1 + |λ|)p|ρ+σ|
d pρ(λ, R+)

,

FREDHOLM ALTERNATIVE

5

we come to the bound

(1.6)

log |h(λ)| ≤ C3t|ρ+σ| |λ|pρ (1 + |λ|)p|ρ+σ|
d pρ(λ, R+)

.

Theorem B applies with

a = pρ,

r = −a = −pρ,

b = −p(ρ + σ), K =

C3
tρ+σ ,

and −2r − a = a > 0, so

{−2r − a}a,ε = −a = −pρ,

s1 = −pρ −

1 + ε

2

.

The sign of s = 3a − 2b + 2r = p(3ρ + 2σ) (which can be either positive or
negative) aﬀects the computation of {s}a,ε, so we will diﬀer two situations. In the
case −ρ/2 ≤ ρ + σ < 0 we have

(1.7)

s > 0,

{s}a,ε = − min(a, s+) = −s,

since, by (0.7), s+ = s = p(3ρ + 2σ) < pρ = a. So s2 = −p(ρ + σ) + 1 + ε, and (0.4)
leads to

(1.8) tp|ρ+σ|+ 1+ε

2 Xζ∈Z(f1)

d pρ+1+ε(ζ, R+)

|ζ|−pρ− 1+ε

2

(t + |ζ|)p|ρ+σ|+1+ε ≤

C4
tρ+σ , 0 < t ≤ C2.

A simple bound (C2 + |ζ|)−1 ≥ C5 |ζ|−1 for |ζ| ≥ 1 and ﬁxed t = C2 gives

Xζ∈Z(f1)∩D−

d pρ+1+ε(ζ, R+) |ζ|pσ− 3

2 (1+ε) ≤ C6,

D− := {|ζ| ≥ 1},

which, after scaling, is (0.9).

If |ζ| ≤ µ ≤ 1, we multiply (1.8) through by tρ+σ−1+ε′
with respect to t from 0 to µC2 (the idea comes from [4])

and integrate it termwise

to obtain

d pρ+1+ε(ζ, R+) |ζ|ρ+σ−pρ−1−ε+ε′

≤ C8 (µC2)ε′

,

Dµ := {|ζ| ≤ µ},

which, after scaling, gives (0.11).

In the case ρ + σ < −ρ/2 the proof is the same with s ≤ 0 and

{s}a,ε = (−3pρ − 2pσ − 1 + ε)+ = l,

s2 =

pρ + l

2

+ 1 + ε.

✷

Remark 1.1. The case (0.7) can be reduced to the one considered in Theorem A
by means of the transformation (the change of variables) λ → 1/λ and the general
formula

d (1/λ, R+) =

d (λ, R+)

|λ|2

,

λ ∈ C\R+.

Remark 1.2. The general form of [3, Theorem 4.5] allows a ﬁnite number of
singularities on R+. So we can obtain the similar results on eigenvalues of ﬁnite
type for analytic operator-valued functions W = I +T on C\R+ subject to the bound
