The vast majority of the pulsars detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) display spectra
with exponential cutoffs falling in a narrow range around a few GeV. Early spectral modelling
predicted spectral cutoff energies of up to 100 GeV. More modern studies estimated spectral
cutoff energies in the 1−20 GeV range.
It was therefore not expected that pulsars would be
visible in the very-high-energy (VHE; >100 GeV) regime. The VERITAS detection (conﬁrmed
by MAGIC) of pulsed emission from the Crab pulsar up to 400 GeV (and now possibly up to
1 TeV) therefore raised important questions about our understanding of the electrodynamics and
local environment of pulsars. H.E.S.S. has now detected pulsed emission from the Vela pulsar
in the 20−120 GeV range, making this the second pulsar detected by a ground-based Cherenkov
telescope. We will review the latest developments in VHE pulsar science, including an overview
of recent observations and reﬁnements to radiation models and magnetic ﬁeld structures. This
will assist us in interpreting the VHE emission detected from the Crab and Vela pulsars, and
predicting the level of VHE emission expected from other pulsars, which will be very important
for the upcoming CTA.

Pulsar emission in the very-high-energy regime

M. Breed

1. Introduction

Since the successful launch of the Fermi LAT [13], a high-energy (HE) satellite measuring g -
rays in the range 20 MeV−300 GeV, two pulsar catalogues (1PC, [2]; 2PC, [3]) have been released,
collectively discussing the light curve and spectral properties of 117 pulsars. The vast majority of
the Fermi-detected pulsars display exponentially cutoff spectra with cutoffs around a few GeV.
These spectral cutoffs are believed to be a signature of curvature radiation (CR), which is assumed
to be the dominating radiation process in the GeV band.

There exist several radiation models that can be used to study HE emission from pulsars.
These include the polar cap (PC; [17]), slot gap (SG; [12]), outer gap (OG; [16]), and the pair-
starved polar cap (PSPC; [21]) models. These models make different assumptions for the geometry
and location of their ‘gap regions’ (where particle acceleration takes place due to an unscreened,
rotation-induced E-ﬁeld parallel to the local B-ﬁeld, as well as subsequent emission by these par-
ticles). To predict realistic HE emission in these standard pulsar models, one has to take detailed
particle transport and radiation mechanisms into account. These mechanisms include CR, syn-
chrotron radiation (SR), and inverse Compton scattering (ICS). More recently, pulsar wind models
were developed that postulate that HE emission originates beyond the light cylinder. These include
the striped wind model in which pulsed HE emission arises from SR by relativistically hot particles
that are accelerated via magnetic reconnection inside the current sheet [31].

Early modelling, assuming the standard OG model, predicted spectral components in the VHE
regime when estimating the ICS ﬂux of primary electrons on SR or soft photons ([16, 33, 24]). This
resulted in a natural bump around a few TeV (involving ∼10 TeV particles) in the extreme Klein-
Nishina limit. However, these components may not survive up to the light cylinder (where the
pulsar’s corotation speed equals the speed of light) and beyond, since two-photon pair production
may lead to absorption of the TeV g -ray ﬂux [24].

Later studies assumed standard pulsar models and CR to be the dominant radiation mechanism
producing HE g -ray emission when performing spectral modelling and found spectral cutoffs of
up to 100 GeV. For example, [15] modelled the cutoffs of millisecond pulsars (MSPs), which
possess relatively low B-ﬁelds and short periods. Their model assumed a static dipole B-ﬁeld, a
PC geometry (emission from HE particles originates close to the stellar surface and the particles
accelerate up to a few stellar radii), and a classical E-ﬁeld expression, also including one-photon
(magnetic) pair creation. Their estimated spectrum cut off at ∼100 GeV. A similar study was done
by [20] who assumed a general relativistic (GR) corrected E-ﬁeld. They also found CR spectral
cutoffs at energies between 50−100 GeV. The X-ray and g -ray spectra of rotation-powered MSPs
were investigated by [21] using a PSPC model (i.e., emission starting at the stellar surface up to
the light cylinder over the full open volume) and a GR-corrected E-ﬁeld, and found CR cutoffs of
∼10−50 GeV (see also [38, 19]). Therefore, they concluded that the HE CR from MSPs occurred
in an energy band that was above the detection range of satellite detectors like EGRET and below
that of ground-based Cherenkov detectors. The optical to g -ray emission spectrum was modelled
by [22] for the Crab pulsar assuming an SG accelerator (i.e., radiation from narrow gaps starting at
the stellar surface up to the light cylinder) and a retarded vacuum dipole (RVD) B-ﬁeld, and found
spectral cutoffs of up to a few GeV. Phase-resolved spectra of the Crab pulsar were also modelled by
[25] using the OG and SG models, predicting HE cutoffs of up to 25 GeV. Another study used the

light curve peaks P1 and P2). Panel (a) represents the data obtained by VERITAS (red solid circles) and
also includes measurements by Fermi LAT (green squares), the measurement >25 GeV from MAGIC (ﬁlled

speciﬁes an exponentially cutoff power law ﬁt, whereas the solid line represents a broken power law ﬁt.
From panel (a) and (b) it is clear that the VERITAS observations signiﬁcantly prefer a broken power law
above an exponentially cutoff power law [8]. In panel (c) the phase-resolved emission spectrum as measured
by MAGIC (dark red squares) from the Crab >400 GeV is shown, together with an OG model that includes
emission from pairs (solid line; [6]).

RVD B-ﬁeld, an extended OG model and a synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) radiation mechanism
(where relativistic particles upscatter the SR photons emitted by the same particle population) to
predict phase-resolved spectra for the Crab, and found HE cutoffs around ∼10 GeV [37].

In view of the above theoretical paradigm it was not expected that pulsars should be visible
in the VHE regime. Later observations therefore challenged this standard paradigm. In this paper
we review the latest VHE observations (Section 2) and theoretical developments (Section 3) which
may help explain these observations. Our conclusions follow in Section 4.

2. Observational revolution

In view of existing HE spectral model predictions, detection of pulsar emission in the VHE
regime was not expected. MAGIC observed the Crab pulsar and detected pulsed emission above
∼ 25 GeV ([7], see pink triangle in Figure 1(a)). This raised the important question of whether the
single CR component extends to higher energies than previously thought. It was very surprising
when VERITAS announced the detection of pulsed emission from the Crab pulsar above ∼ 100 GeV
[8]. In Figure 1(a) and (b) the VERITAS data are best described by a broken power law. MAGIC
conﬁrmed this spectral shape (see Figure 1(c)) when they observed emission ∼400 GeV [6], soon
after their initial detection of emission >25 GeV. This implied severe constraints on the spectral
interpretation: invoking only a single CR component (or e.g., IC), or more than one (e.g., CR and
SSC) qualitatively new spectral components.

Three trends were noted in the energy-dependent pulse proﬁles. First, the peaks remain at the
same phase f , i.e., the main pulse P1 at f = [−0.1,0.13] and the interpulse P2 at f = [0.35,0.45].

Figure 2: Pulse proﬁles of the Crab pulsar in different energy ranges, increasing from bottom to top, as
obtained by MAGIC (panels (a)-(c), [6]) and Fermi (panel (d), [1]). Three effects are visible in the energy-
dependent proﬁles: the peaks remain at the same phases (shaded light grey areas), the P1/P2 ratio decreases
as energy increases (at energies >25 GeV the peaks are nearly equal in height), and the pulse width decreases
with increasing energy. The dashed line is the background level.

Second, the ratio of intensity of P1 vs. that of P2 (i.e., P1/P2) decreases as energy increases. At
energies >25 GeV, P1/P2 ≈ 1. Lastly, the pulse width decreases with an increase in energy. These
effects are illustrated in Figure 2 which shows pulse proﬁles of the Crab pulsar in different energy
ranges (increasing from bottom to top panel) as obtained by MAGIC (panels (a)-(c)) and Fermi
(panel (d)). MAGIC detected signiﬁcant bridge emission above 50 GeV between f = [0.024,0.37]
[6, 35], consistent with the Fermi observations [1]. The intensity and proﬁle shape of the bridge
emission vary as a function of energy. At energies <10 GeV the spectrum for the bridge emission
(emission between P1 and P2) is notably harder than that of P1 and P2. MAGIC has just claimed
detection of photons with energies up to 1 TeV coinciding with P2 in the Crab’s proﬁle (Aleksic et
al. 2015, in prep.). The detection of emission >400 GeV has not been conﬁrmed by VERITAS to
date [30]. However, they are continuing to search for VHE pulsed emission in their archival data
of 19 known pulsars with ∼20 hours of observations each [11].

Recently, pulsed emission was detected from the Vela pulsar down to 20 GeV with H.E.S.S. [36]
and up to 80 GeV with Fermi ([26], see Figure 3). The second peak in both light curves are in phase.
The associated emission spectrum is shown in Figure 4. It is probably too early to discriminate be-

dent that the P2 peaks are phase-aligned.

tween a spectrum that extends to high energies as a power law or cuts off (or breaks) around tens
of GeV.

The detection of the Crab pulsar above several hundred GeV prompted Fermi to search for
pulsed emission from other pulsars at higher energies as well. They detected signiﬁcant pulsations
above 10 GeV from 20 pulsars and above 25 GeV from 12 pulsars [4]. A stacking analysis in-
volving 150 Fermi-detected pulsars (excluding the Crab pulsar) was performed by [28]. However,
no emission above 50 GeV was detected, implying that VHE pulsar detections may be rare, given
current telescope sensitivities.

Since Geminga is one of the brightest g -ray pulsars, it is a promising VHE candidate. Deep
upper limits have been obtained by VERITAS for this pulsar above 100 GeV [9]. Sixty-three hours
of MAGIC data were analysed by [14], but no VHE pulsed emission was detected. Upper limits for
the VHE ﬂux above an energy threshold of 166 GeV have also been obtained by VERITAS for the
transitional binary pulsar PSR J1023+0038, with 18.1 hours observational time for the radio MSP
state and 8.2 hours for the accretion / low-mass X-ray binary state [32]. Ground-based Cherenkov
telescopes as well as water Cherenkov telescopes, e.g., HAWC [10], are now searching for more
examples of VHE pulsars.

3. New theoretical ideas

All of the standard pulsar emission models (see Section 1) predicted HE spectral cutoffs be-
tween a few GeV and up to ∼ 100 GeV, generally assuming static B-ﬁeld solutions. Clearly, re-
ﬁnements to these radiation models and B-ﬁelds are needed to explain the observed VHE emission
from the Crab and possibly other bright pulsars. Two new classes of models exist, including inner
and outer magnetospheric models.

One new idea is a revised OG model which can produce IC radiation up to ∼ 400 GeV due to
secondary and tertiary pairs upscattering infrared to ultraviolet photons [6]. In this OG model, the
IC ﬂux depends sensitively on the B-ﬁeld structure near the light cylinder, and the B-ﬁeld lines are

assumed to straighten compared to the RVD ﬁeld. Another idea was proposed by [27] invoking the
SSC radiation process. This is indeed a promising radiation mechanism, but is subject to uncer-
tainties in the injected particle spectral shape and B-ﬁeld structure. The multi-wavelength pulsed
emission from the Crab pulsar, from radio-to-TeV, was modelled by [18], assuming a single-pole
annular gap model, although many free parameters are present in this model. The SSC radiation
mechanism was applied by [23] to predict optical to g -ray spectra (see Figure 5(a)), assuming an
SG model and a force-free B-ﬁeld structure. This process relies critically on the assumed electro-
dynamics and the magnetospheric structure. They performed simulations for the Crab and Vela
pulsars, as well as two MSPs, i.e., B1821−24 and B1937+21. However, the only signiﬁcant pre-
dicted SSC component was for the Crab pulsar. For a pulsar to produce signiﬁcant SSC emission,
a high level of non-thermal X-ray emission, i.e., a strong B-ﬁeld at the light cylinder is required so
that there will be sufﬁcient soft SR photons for subsequent IC scattering. Also, high pair energies
and multiplicity (depending on the B-ﬁeld strength and the period P) are necessary for VHE SSC
emission. They furthermore tested the addition of an HE power-law extension to the pair spectrum
(dashed lines in Figure 5(a)). The resulting SR spectrum can account for the observed emission in
the 1 − 100 MeV range. However, the resulting SSC component exceeds the observed MAGIC and
VERITAS points, implying that the observed 1 − 100 MeV emission is not produced by the same
particles that produce the SSC emission.

There are also models which explain the observed VHE emission from pulsars by invoking
radiation from the pulsar wind beyond the light cylinder. For example, [5] modelled an ultra-
relativistic wind from the Crab pulsar. This pulsar outﬂow is dominated by the Poynting ﬂux in-
side the light cylinder, but abruptly becomes particle-dominated outside (the so-called s -problem,

where s
is the ratio of Poynting ﬂux to kinetic energy ﬂux). They modelled this process by as-
suming instant or rapid acceleration of particles beyond the light cylinder, with the VHE emission
produced at a radius Rw ≈ 30RLC (in units of light cylinder radius RLC), with a Lorentz factor
G w = 5 × 105. The predicted light curves only take some geometrical effects into consideration,
but not the usual caustic effects, i.e., aberration, retardation, and sweepback of B-ﬁeld lines inside
the light cylinder. This should inﬂuence estimates of Rw and G w. They predicted VHE emission
from IC scattering of the measured power-law X-ray soft-photon ﬁeld (i.e., the seed photons), and
found a sharp energy cutoff at ∼500 GeV in the g -ray spectrum. Another study proposed a striped
wind model [29], using a split monopole B-ﬁeld, in which GeV emission originates in the wavy
current sheet. The HE emission arises from SR by relativistic particles that are accelerated via mag-
netic reconnection. They constrained four parameters, i.e., fraction of magnetic energy dissipated
(efﬁciency) e d, dissipation distance ˆr in units of RLC, particle spectral index s, and Lorentz factor
of the wind G
, by matching the SR ﬂux to the phase-average spectrum. Various best ﬁts to the
spectrum for the Crab pulsar is shown in Figure 5(b). For the Crab pulsar they found a maximum
G ≈ 100 for low e d and ˆr (orange curve). However, for a larger value of s and ˆr, and a smaller
value of G
, the SSC spectral component becomes signiﬁcantly brighter (red curve), and describes
the VHE g -ray emission best.

4. Conclusions and future work

It was not expected that pulsars would be visible in the VHE regime. The detection by VER-
ITAS of VHE pulsed emission from the Crab pulsar at energies up to 400 GeV raised important
questions regarding the electrodynamics and local environment of pulsars. In view of such obser-
vations, reﬁnements to radiation models and B-ﬁeld structures are necessary. More VHE pulsars
may be found by the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) which will have a ten-fold in-

crease in sensitivity compared to present-day Cherenkov telescopes. Revised models will assist
us in interpreting the VHE emission detected from the Crab and Vela pulsars, and predicting ﬂux
levels for other potential VHE pulsars.
