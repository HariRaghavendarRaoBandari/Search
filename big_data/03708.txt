Abstract. In the paper we prove the containment I (nm) ⊂ M (n−1)m I m, for a radical ideal I
of s general points in Pn, where s ≥ 2n. As a corollary we get that the Chudnovsky Conjecture
holds for a very general set of at least 2n points in Pn.

1. Introduction

Given any subscheme Z ⊂ Pn and its homogenous ideal I = IZ in F[Pn] = F[x0, . . . , xn], we
deﬁne α(I) as the minimal degree of a non-zero element in I. We will assume that char F = 0.
In general α(I) is hard to compute and it behaves quite unexpectedly. However there is an

asymptotic counterpart of the α-invariant, which is the Waldschmidt constant deﬁned as

(1)

(2)

α(I (m))

m

,

bα(I) = lim

m−→∞

α(I (m)) ≥ mbα(I)

α(I (m))
m .

where I (m) denotes the m-th symbolic power of the ideal I (for the deﬁnition and basic properties
of I (m) see [15]). It turns out that this constant is well deﬁned and satisﬁes the inequality

m≥1

for all m. In fact bα(I) = inf
For an ideal I we have α(I r) = rα(I), but the behaviour of α(I (m)) is much more complicated
and less understood. Skoda in 1977 [19] showed that α(I (m)) ≥ mα(I)/n for an ideal I of points
in Pn (over complex numbers). Chudnovsky [4], in 1981, improved that bound for n = 2 to
α(I (m)) ≥ m(α(I) + 1)/2 and conjectured the following.
Conjecture 1 (Chudnovsky). For an ideal I of points in Pn the following inequality holds:

Esnault and Viehweg [12], in 1983 showed that α(I (m)) ≥ m(α(I) + 1)/n for any set of points
In 2002 Ein, Lazarsfeld, Smith in [11] and Hochster and Huneke in [16] showed that, for
any homogeneous ideal I in F[Pn], the containment I (nm) ⊂ I m holds, thus recovering the
Skoda bound more generally — for all homogeneous ideals (since I (nm) ⊂ I m, α(I (nm)) ≥
α(I m) = nmα(I)/n; passing with m to inﬁnity gives bα(I) ≥ α(I)/n). Harbourne and Huneke

in [15], Lemma 3.2, observed that Chudnovsky Conjecture would follow from a more general
containment

I (nm) ⊂ M (n−1)mI m,

(3)

holds.

where by M = (x0, . . . , xn) we denote the irrelevant maximal ideal.

The containment (3) holds (for a given m) for general points in P2 ([15], Proposition 3.10),
for at most n + 1 general points in Pn and also for general points in P3 ([7]). As a corollary, the
Chudnovsky Conjecture holds for very general points in P3.

The main result of the present paper is the following theorem.

Theorem 2. For a nonnegative integer m, and for a radical ideal I of s general points in Pn,
where s ≥ 2n, the containment

I (nm) ⊂ M (n−1)mI m

As a corollary, the Chudnovsky Conjecture holds for a very general set of at least 2n points

in Pn.

We will work on ﬁlling the gap between n + 1 and 2n in our future project.

2. Bound for bα(I)

In this section we give a bound for the Waldschmidt constant of an ideal of s very general
points in Pn. The bound in fact easily follows from the much stronger result of Evain [13], who
showed that for an ideal I of general kn points α(I) is “expected”. Since the methods of Evain
are highly non-trivial and very delicate, we give a short proof of our bound here to make the
paper more self-contained.

Theorem 3. For a radical ideal I of s very general points P1, . . . , Ps in Pn we have

bα(I) ≥ ⌊ n√s⌋.

Proof. To prove the bound we have to show that the system of divisors of degree dm − 1
passing through P1, . . . , Ps with multiplicity m is empty if d = ⌊ n√s⌋.
Without loss of generality we may suppose that s = kn, k ∈ N, as the nonexistence of the
system (km − 1; m×kn
For n = 1 the nonexistence of the system (km − 1; m×k) is trivial. Then we proceed by
induction. (Note that for n = 2 the nonexistence of the system (km − 1; m×k2
) was also proved
by Nagata in [18]).

), implies the nonexistence of (km − 1, m×r), kn ≤ r < (k + 1)n.

For n ≥ 2, suppose there exists a divisor in Pn of degree km − 1, passing through P1, . . . , Ps
with multiplicity m. Take k general hyperplanes in Pn and put kn−1 points on each such
hyperplane (in general position). Then on the hyperplane we have the system of divisors
of degree km − 1 which have to pass through k2 points with multiplicity m. By inductive
assumption, this system is empty. Thus, all hyperplanes must be components of the system.
Repeating the procedure m times we get that the system has to have degree km, not km − 1,
a contradiction.

Here we prove an auxiliary combinatorial lemma, which we will use in the proof of Theorem 5

3. Combinatorial lemma

Lemma 4. (1) For any integers k ≥ 4 and n ≥ 3 the following inequality holds:

(2) Moreover, if n ≥ 5

holds.

kn ≤(cid:18)kn − n
n (cid:19).
3n ≤(cid:18)2n
n(cid:19)

Proof. First we prove (1). Observe that it is enough to prove the inequality for k = 4 only.

Indeed, our inequality may be written as

The left-hand side is greater or equal to

(nk − n) · . . . · (nk − 2n + 1) ≥ n!kn.
4 (cid:19) k,
(cid:16)n −

4(cid:17) k · . . . ·(cid:18)n −

as k ≥ 4. Dividing both sides by kn and multiplying by 4n we see that this is enough to prove

(4n − n) · . . . · (4n − n + 1) ≥ n!4n,

ie our inequality with k = 4.

Thus, we have to prove

For this, we will use the Stirling formula (see eg [14]):

where p(n) > 0. Thus, C is an increasing function, with the smallest value C[3] > 0.47.

Thus it is enough to prove

Now we are able to prove our containment theorem.

4. Containment result

Theorem 5. For a radical ideal I of s very general points in Pn, where s ≥ 2n and n ≥ 3 the
containment

holds, for any natural m ≥ 1.

I (nm) ⊂ M (n−1)mI m

Proof.

It is obvious that I (nm) ⊂ I (m). By [1], Lemma 1.3, for ideal I of points, I (m) is
the saturation of I m with respect to the irrelevant ideal M . By deﬁnition, (I m)t = (I (m))t for
t ≥ satdeg(I m), where satdeg(I m) is the saturation degree of I m (here, Jt denotes the set of all
elements of degree t in J). Let reg(I m) denote the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of I m, see
eg [5]. We have also the inequalities

The ﬁrst inequality holds for homogeneous ideals [5], Lemma 1.5, the second follows from [3] or
[10] for the ideals with Krull dimension at most 1.

satdeg(I m) ≤ reg(I m) ≤ m reg(I).

Thus it is enough to prove that

to obtain I (mn) ⊂ I m, and moreover, it is enough to prove that
α(I (mn)) ≥ (n − 1)m + σ(I m),

α(I (mn)) ≥ m reg(I)

where σ(I m) denotes the maximal degree of an element in a minimal set of generators of I m,
to obtain I (nm) ⊂ M (n−1)mI m, see [15], Proposition 2.3. Since also σ(I m) = mσ(I) ≤ m reg(I),
it is enough to show that

By (2) the above inequality follows from

α(I (mn)) ≥ (n − 1)m + m reg(I).

For the ideal I as in our theorem we have that reg(I) = r + 1, where r is such an integer that

Suppose to the contrary, that n⌊ n√s⌋ < n − 1 + r + 1. If we can prove that then

(6)

we get a contradiction, and we are done.

As ⌊ n√s⌋ is constant (equal k − 1) for all s = (k − 1)n, . . . , kn − 1, we may assume that the
right hand side of inequality (6) equals kn − 1, which is the worst possible case.
Thus, we reduced the problem to proving that for r ≥ nk − 2n + 1 we have

kn − 1 ≤(cid:18)r + n − 1
(cid:19).

n

From Theorem 3 we know that

see [2], page 2.

Thus, it is enough to prove that

for r satisfying

nbα(I) ≥ n − 1 + reg(I).

bα(I) ≥ ⌊ n√s⌋.

n⌊ n√s⌋ ≥ n − 1 + r + 1,
(cid:18)r − 1 + n

(cid:18)r + n − 1
(cid:19) ≥ s,

This will follow if we prove that

kn ≤(cid:18)kn − n
n (cid:19).

This last inequality is proved in Lemma 4 for n ≥ 3 and k ≥ 4 and for k ≥ 3 and n ≥ 5. This
proves our theorem for all n ≥ 5 and s ≥ 2n (remember, that we have s ≥ (k−1)n) and also when
n = 3, 4 and s ≥ 3n. Dumnicki in [7] showed the containment for any number of very general
points in P3, so to ﬁnish the proof we need only to deal with the case n = 4, s = 24, . . . 34 − 1.
Moreover, checking inequality (5) ”by hand” for we see that it remains only to prove our theorem
when n = 4, s = 71, . . . , 80. This is done in the lemma below.

Lemma 6. The Waldschmidt constant for ideal of at least 71 very general points in P4 is
bounded by below 9/4.

Before the proof, let us observe that using the bound 9/4 instead of ⌊ 4√s⌋ in (5) ﬁnishes the
proof for n = 4 and s = 71, . . . , 80.
Proof. It is enough to show that for each m the system of hypersurfaces of degree 9m − 1 with
71 4m-fold points is empty. Since the system of degree 8m− 1 with 16 4m-fold points is empty,
by [6] (Theorem 1) it is enough to show that 9m− 1 with four 8m-fold points and seven 4m-fold
points is empty. The last one, by Theorem 3 in [6], is equivalent to a system of degree 2 with
at least one point of multiplicity 4m, which is empty.
