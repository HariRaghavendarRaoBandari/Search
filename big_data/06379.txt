ABSTRACT

Context. On 2011 June 7 debris from a large ﬁlament eruption fell back to the Sun causing bright ultraviolet (UV) and extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) splashes across the surface. These impacts may give clues on the process of stellar accretion.
Aims. The aim is to investigate how the impact emission is inﬂuenced by structures in the falling ejecta and at the solar surface.
Methods. We determine the UV and EUV light curves of a sample of impacts. The ballistic impact velocity is estimated from the
ejection and landing times and, where possible, compared with the velocity derived by tracking the downﬂows in SDO/AIA and
STEREO/EUVI images. Estimates of the column density before impact are made from the darkness of the falling plasma in the 193 Å
channel.
Results. The impact velocities were between 230 and 450 km s−1. All impacts produced bright EUV emission at the impact site but
bright UV was only observed when the impacting fragments reached the chromosphere. There was no clear relation between EUV
intensity and kinetic energy. Low UV to EUV intensity ratios (IUV /IEUV) were seen (i) from impacts of low column-density fragments,
(ii) when splashes, produced by some impacts, prevented subsequent fragments from reaching the chromosphere, and (iii) from an
impact in an active region.The earliest impacts with the lowest velocity (∼ 250 km s−1) had the highest IUV /IEUV.
Conclusions. The IUV /IEUV decreases with impact velocity, magnetic ﬁeld at the impact site, and EUV ionising ﬂux. Many of
the infalling fragments dissipate above the chromosphere either due to ionisation and trapping in magnetic structures, or to them
encountering a splash from an earlier impact. If the same happens in accreting stars then the reduced X-ray compared to optical
emission that has been observed is more likely due to absorption by the trailing stream than locally at the impact site.

1. Introduction

The plasma falling and crashing into the Sun after the eruptive
ﬂare on 2011 June 7 has been compared to stellar accretion ﬂows
(Reale et al. 2013). The velocities and densities of impacting
fragments are similar. Also in both situations the magnetic ﬁeld
may aﬀect the ﬂows as they fall towards the surface. The im-
pacts during the 2011 June 7 event fell with a range of speeds
and densities into a variety of magnetic environments. They may
therefore provide a testbed for accretion onto unresolved stellar
objects.

Accretion onto young stars is thought to explain excesses
seen in their infrared (Mendoza V. 1966; Rucinski 1985), ultra-
violet (UV) (Herbig & Goodrich 1986) and soft X-ray (Kastner
et al. 2002; Schmitt et al. 2005) emission compared to stars
of similar spectral type. Models of the emission from accretion
have made a number of critical assumptions regarding the struc-
ture of the accretion ﬂows, the pre-impact sites, and the optical
thickness of the heated plasma at the impact site. For example,
simulations often assume uniform plasma columns channelled
along one-dimensional (1D) ﬂux tubes (Calvet & Gullbring
1998; Sacco et al. 2008, 2010) or accretion along uniform verti-
cal ﬁelds (Orlando et al. 2010; Bonito et al. 2014). Reale et al.
(2013) used the spatially resolved solar impacts on June 7 to in-
vestigate the applicability of 2D hydrodynamic (HD) accretion
models to prominence plasma falling back to the Sun. They in-

vestigated fragments with a velocity around 400 km s−1 and a
density 1010 cm−3 plunging through the solar corona and into
chromosphere. Similar to the stellar accretion models, the im-
pacting fragments sank deep into the chromosphere where their
energy was dissipated creating forward and reverse shocks with
high-temperature outﬂows from the impact region into the sur-
rounding corona. To model the emission Reale et al. (2013) as-
sumed all EUV emission from below the transition region was
absorbed and therefore not detected. With this assumption, they
concluded that the observed EUV intensities originated from the
5 to 30% of the fragment plasma that radiated above the tran-
sition region. A study of stellar accretion revealed that accre-
tion rates derived from X-ray ﬂuxes are considerably lower than
those inferred from UV/optical/ infrared ﬂuxes (Curran et al.
2011), suggesting that in stellar systems X-rays may also be ab-
sorbed. Reale et al. (2013) argue that absorption at the impact
site may explain the lower accretion rates derived from X-ray
observations; however their models did not account for structure
induced by magnetic ﬁelds at the impact site. Magnetic ﬁelds
may reduce the local absorption (Orlando et al. 2013; Bonito
et al. 2014), leading Bonito et al. (2014) to conclude that the
unperturbed, trailing accretion stream rather than absorption at
the impact site is a more probable explanation for the low X-ray
ﬂuxes.

The solar observations of the June 7 impacts can be used to
investigate impact depth and eﬀects of magnetic structuring at

the impact site by comparing high resolution EUV (131, 171,
193, 211 Å) and UV (1600 and 1700 Å) observations of the
impacts because the EUV and UV emission come from diﬀer-
ent depths in the atmosphere. The EUV emission is only visible
above the transition region because EUV from below is obscured
by H i, He i, He ii. On the other hand both the transition region
and chromosphere are transparent to UV emission. Thus the UV
intensities give a indication of how much plasma penetrates to
the chromosphere. Naively one would expect that since the EUV
from deep impacts is absorbed, then the intensity of the UV to
EUV (IUV /IEUV) should increase the deeper the impact. Also ac-
cording to Sacco et al. (2010), the faster impacts should pene-
trate deeper into the atmosphere. Consequently one expects the
(IUV /IEUV) to increase with velocity. By surveying the UV and
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission from solar impacts of diﬀer-
ent sizes and velocities, we investigate the conditions controlling
the optically thin (UV) to optically thick (EUV) intensity ratios
at impact sites on the Sun.

The eruption on 2011 June 7 in NOAA AR 11226 (S22W55)
resulted in a fast coronal mass ejection (CME) with velocity
about 1250 km s−1 in interplanetary space. In EUV images, a
dome-shaped CME wave expanded across the disk with veloc-
ities of up to 960 km s−1 (Li et al. 2012; Cheng et al. 2012).
Behind the fast wave, ﬁlament plasma was thrown upward, and a
lot of it fell back creating impacts across the solar surface. Four
of the impacts into the quiet Sun have been studied by Gilbert
et al. (2013). In each of these, the main brightening is due to
dissipation of kinetic energy on impact. The eruption was seen
from both the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar
TErrestial Relations Observatory Ahead (STEREO-A) space-
craft when STEREO-A was 94◦ ahead of Earth. Gilbert et al.
(2013) used images from both these spacecraft to estimate the
height-time progress of several ejecta. Although straightforward
in theory, in practice it is diﬃcult to pick out exactly the same
ejecta from both viewpoints in the image pairs with 2.5 min ca-
dence, especially when the material is close to the Sun. The ve-
locities given by Gilbert et al. (2013) were determined roughly
5 min before impact which means that the actual impact velocity
is probably about 50-100 km s−1 higher, given the solar gravita-
tional acceleration close to the surface, 274 m s−2.

The coronal magnetic ﬁeld was complex with connections
between the three neighbouring active regions in the south (van
Driel-Gesztelyi et al. 2014) and the active region to the north.
As the plasma falls back through the corona, it breaks up due to
Rayleigh-Taylor type of instabilities (Innes et al. 2012) generat-
ing long, thin strands with dense clumps at their heads (Carlyle
et al. 2014).

In this paper we present the results of a survey of the UV
and EUV emission from 16 fragments. In the next section, we
describe the image sequences used. The analysis ﬁrst explains
the basis for the impact velocity, then in the next section we
present the characteristics of the 16 impacts, and show details of
fragments impacting into various environments. The discussion
section summarises the results and in particular the conditions
for large UV to EUV intensity ratios (IUV /IEUV).

2. Observations
We have determined the light curves of impacts from images
obtained by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen
et al. 2012) onboard SDO in the 1700, 1600, 131, 171, 193,
211 Å channels and thus sample the atmosphere’s response over
a range of temperatures and hence atmospheric heights. The
EUV channels were taken with a cadence of 12 s and the UV

2

channels alternated between 1600 and 1700 Å with a 12 s inter-
val between the two channels so the cadence of each UV chan-
nel was 24 s. At the time of the eruption, 304 Å images were
taken with a low, 60 s, cadence and were therefore not used in
the analysis. The 1700 Å emission was mostly continuum from
the chromosphere with a small contribution from line emission
from the transition region. Similarly continuum from the chro-
mosphere was the main contributor to the 1600 Å channel but
there may have been a signiﬁcant contribution from the tran-
sition region due to C iv emission. The 131 Å emission from
the impacts was usually weak and mostly due to Fe viii. The
171 Å emission, predominantly from Fe ix, came from slightly
cooler plasma (0.63 MK) than the Fe xii emission (1.4 MK) seen
in the 193 Å channel and the Fe xiv (1.9 MK) revealed by the
211 Å channel. Impacts in the chromosphere probably had ad-
ditional contributions to the EUV channels from the transition
region (Brosius & Holman 2012) as the plasma was rapidly ion-
ising so temperatures derived from the emission ratios of these
bright impacts are likely to be unreliable; however the I171/I193
or the I171/I211 should give a good indication of the temperature
of plasma around coronal brightenings caused by impacts.

In all EUV images the cold ﬁlament plasma is seen as dark
structures against the background corona due to absorption of
H and He photoionising radiation. They are best seen in the
well-exposed 171 and 193 Å images. The background is gen-
erally smoother in the 193 Å images since it was from the hotter
corona, and we used this channel for determining column densi-
ties of the impacting fragments. Column densities were derived
with the simple one-wavelength method suggested by Williams
et al. (2013) that uses the relative darkening of the corona due to
the ﬁlament plasma.

Imager

Images from the Extreme Ultraviolet

(EUVI)
(Wuelser et al. 2004) at 195 Å on the STEREO-A spacecraft
were used in combination with images from the AIA 193 Å
channel to obtain height-time proﬁles for some of the ejecta. The
relatively low cadence of STEREO-A (2.5 min) and the wide
separation of the spacecraft (94◦) made it diﬃcult to unambigu-
ously pick out the same part of the same ejecta in the AIA/EUVI-
A image pairs. Since the eruption was close to the east limb in
the EUVI images, many of the early ejecta falling on the east of
the eruption were hidden in the STEREO images due to inter-
vening ﬁlament ejecta. The ones best seen from both spacecraft
were those from the northern edge and the later, well-separated
ejecta falling from greater heights.

The magnetic ﬁelds at the impact sites were obtained from
HMI (Scherrer et al. 2012) line-of-sight magnetograms. These
were generally weak (¡50 G).

3. Filament eruption
The ﬁlament rise started at 06:28 UT. Material was rapidly
ejected into the corona with a distribution of velocities so that
the central part rose faster and further than the ﬁlament sides.
Using AIA and EUVI-A images, the paths taken by diﬀerent
parts of the eruption could be tracked. For example, in Fig. 1,
the ejecta along the northern path (black) had an average speed
between 320 and 370 km s−1, and the speed along the south-
ern path (white) was between 450 and 600 km s−1. The uncer-
tainty is because the ejecta change shape which made it diﬃcult
to ﬁnd exactly the same plasma in consecutive EUVI images,
taken 2.5 min apart.

Material from the northern edge is visible throughout its as-
cent and descent in both AIA and EUVI-A images (Fig. 2). This

allowed us to track the height-time proﬁle of an early impact
from the northern edge. The height-time path, shown in Fig. 3,
is well ﬁt by a parabola representing ejecta leaving the solar sur-
face at 06:25:30 UT with a velocity of 232 km s−1. Note that in
this ﬁt the ejection from the surface is 2.5 min earlier than the
start time of the ﬁlament eruption from 1.07 R(cid:12). This is the ejecta
responsible for ‘region 3’ studied by Gilbert et al. (2013). They
used the last two points about 5 min before impact, at 1.03 and
1.07 R(cid:12), to deduce a velocity of 146 km s−1, which they took as
the impact velocity. This corresponds with our ﬁt; however the
true impact velocity, obtained by extrapolating to the surface, is
about 80 km s−1 higher. In this case, it looks as though the ejecta
did follow a ballistic path but it is the only impact where we were
able to track almost the entire path of the ejecta so we cannot say
if other ejecta were also ballistic. Some of the higher ejecta ap-
pear to have been slowed by drag forces (Dolei et al. 2014). For
all impacts we computed the ballistic impact velocity from the
ﬂight time, and for those impacts that could be tracked in both
AIA and EUVI-A images, the triangulation velocity about 5 min
before impact. As discussed by Reale et al. (2013) the velocity
may be a critical parameter for understanding the impact emis-
sion.

4. Impacts
We selected 16 impacts. Table 1 lists the best estimates for the
impact landing time, their position, their maximum intensity in
the 171 Å channel integrated over a box of roughly 10” x 10”,
their column density 2−4 min before impact from the darkening
in the 193 Å channel, the mass of the impacting material, the

itational acceleration of 274 m s−2, and zero drag.

impacts’ velocity assuming ballistic motion and an ejection time
from the surface at 06:25:30 UT, their velocity measured from
triangulation, and the average magnetic ﬁeld in an area 10(cid:48)(cid:48) x
10(cid:48)(cid:48) around the impact. Triangulation results in a velocity about
50 − 100 km s−1 less than ballistic. As mentioned already, the
diﬀerence can be attributed to the fact that the last triangulation
position was measured 2 − 5 min before impact and the veloc-
ity was computed from the last two points in the trajectory. The
magnetic ﬁelds were typically quiet-Sun values except for im-
pact 9 which landed in an active region. Impact 15 landed in a
predominantly negative-polarity coronal hole region.

4.1. UV and EUV intensities
Gilbert et al. (2013) have shown that on impact there was gener-
ally a rapid increase to peak intensity in all EUV channels simul-
taneously, followed by a slower intensity decrease. The sharp
rise was caused by the initial impact. The increase in pressure
due to the impact subsequently changed the environment into
which the trailing fragment plasma was falling. In several events
bright EUV emission, looking like a splash, was seen propagat-
ing back from the impact site. The characteristics of one of the
largest splashes is described later. In this section we concentrate
on emission from the bright impacts, not their surroundings.

To avoid emission from the surroundings, we have chosen
compact, short-lived impacts, and obtained light curves in the
close vicinity of the impacts. We typically used boxes of size
10” x 10” but they varied according to the size of the bright
emission kernel. When the impact was part of a larger group, the
intensities were taken from a small region centred on the bright-
est 1600 Å site. If there was no noticeable 1600 Å brightening
then the region is centred on the brightest 171 Å patch. Since
the impacts were much brighter than the surroundings and were
computed after background subtraction, results are not sensitive
to the box size.

Fig. 4 shows an example of a fragment group. The group
started in the corona as a single ﬁnger, the front then broke up
into at least 6 smaller ﬁngers. The physics of the break up is
still not well understood. It seems to have been inﬂuenced by the
magnetic ﬁeld and the interaction of the wind with the partially
ionised falling plasma (Innes et al. 2012). Each high density ﬁn-
ger tip led to a bright circular impact at 1600 Å. This is illustrated
in Fig. 4(c) where we show a composite of the brightest 1600 Å

Table 1. Parameters of the selected impacts. I171 are the peak impact 171 Å channel intensities. The column densities are an estimate
of the neutral hydrogen component 2-4 min before impact. The mass was computed by integrating the column densities in the falling
plasma. The ballistic velocity assumes an ejection time from the surface 06:25:30 UT. The triangulation velocity is the velocity about
5 min before impact. The magnetic ﬁeld strengths, B+ and B-, are the average positive and negative ﬁeld in the region around the
impact. Marked impacts have been analysed by 1Gilbert et al. (2013), 2Reale et al. (2014).

and the dark,193 Å downﬂow tracks. Downﬂow tracks were used
by Reale et al. (2013) to show the motion of the falling frag-
ments. These tracks are given by the minimum intensity value of
each pixel during the downﬂow. The 171 Å emission from the
impact was more diﬀuse, covered a larger area and lasted longer
than the 1600 Å. It came both from the corona and the impact
site. The impact, indicated by an arrow and surrounded by a box
in (d), is impact 4. The box indicates the region over which the
intensities were integrated.

As seen in Table 1, the impacts’ 171 Å intensities covered a
range of almost two orders of magnitude and show no simple re-
lation to either the mass or velocity in the falling plasma. The in-
tensities are integrated over the box surrounding the impact site
and their intensity depends more on the size of the impact site,
than on the maximum intensity over the impact site. For example
impact 13 was seven times brighter than 14 although it had the
same mass and was slower. As discussed below, the enhanced
EUV intensities were probably due to dissipation of kinetic en-
ergy in the transition region or corona where trapping along low-
lying coronal ﬁeld prevented the fragment from falling as deep
in the chromosphere as the HD models of Reale et al. (2013)
predict.

The maximum of the impact’s intensity in several channels
relative to the maximum 171 Å intensities are represented as a
column chart in Fig. 5. Two early impacts, 2 and 3, stand out
because of their much higher-than-average IUV /IEUV. Both these
impacts had an impact velocity between 230 and 250 km s−1 and
landed in quiet-Sun. A close up of impact 3’s 1600 and 171 Å
emissions is shown in Fig. 6. The 171 Å brightening occurred
about 30 s after the 1600 Å brightening. According to the HD
simulations of Reale et al. (2013), impacts with velocity about

250 km s−1 should not produce signiﬁcant EUV emission so
there must be additional dissipation eﬀects not accounted for in
their simulations.

The time delay was typical for the EUV and UV emissions,
as noted by Reale et al. (2014). It was seen in all impacts with
roughly circular UV emission kernels. An explanation, given in
Reale et al. (2014), is that the 1600 Å is from a second stream of
falling fragments that is shock-heated to transition region tem-
peratures by the backﬂow from the initial impact; however in
most of the impacts studied here (e.g. Fig. 4) the plasma accu-
mulates at the head of the fragment and the 1600 Å appeared
in front of the downﬂow tracks so this explanation is unlikely.
Quantitative computations showing the piling up of plasma at the
head of fragments have been reported by Carlyle et al. (2014).
Another problem with the Reale et al. (2014) scenario is that the
main peaks in the 1600 Å are almost 100 s after the initial impact
(Fig. 1c in Reale et al. (2014)) but the observations show only a
single peak from the impact site. Also the brightening was seen
from the same sites and with similar light curves in both the 1600
and 1700 Å channels (Fig. 7), implying that it is chromospheric
not transition region emission. To understand the delay between
the EUV and UV requires more detailed models of the dynam-
ics and ionization of the chromosphere’s reaction to the impacts,
including magnetic eﬀects.

The circular shape of the 1600 Å suggests that the emis-
sion was from the essentially uniform chromosphere rather than
the more structured corona. Many impacts produced thread-like
structures at 171 Å surrounding or connecting the main impact
site suggesting that although quiet Sun, the corona may still be
structured by the magnetic ﬁeld.

There were two impacts with abnormally low IUV /IEUV; the
one in the active region (9), and one low column-density impact
(15). The low column-density impact (15) was the only one with
a I193/I171 greater than one. The ratio was around 0.5 for most
other impacts.

Since the kinetic energy of the impact is critical to understand
the emission, the impacting mass is an important parameter. We
have tested various methods to calculate the mass but are not sat-
isﬁed with any. The computation of mass is subjective because
as the plasma fell it broke up creating a broad front of fragments
(e.g. Fig. 4) so that one needs to decide when to measure the
mass. Also if the falling plasma was in the form of long ﬁn-
gers, it was not obvious which part to take as the impact mass.
In several cases, however, it was possible to identify the impact-
ing mass. The estimates given in Table 1 were obtained in these
cases by integrating the hydrogen column density of impacting
plasma over the fragment area, dividing by the hydrogen abun-
dance, 0.92, and multiplying by the pixel size, 0.19 Mm2, and
the mean atomic mass, 2 × 10−24 g.

For all impacts we were able to estimate the neutral hydro-
gen column density in individual fragments. It was not possible
to determine the line-of-sight width of the fragments so densities
could not be calculated, nevertheless column density may give a
rough idea of the relative densities of the fragments. The column
densities were obtained by taking the ratio of the track image
to a background image in the 193 Å channel which gives the
evolution of the maximum optical depth at 193 Å in the falling
fragment. Then using Equation 4 and Figure 2(a) of Williams

Fig. 8. Column density during the downﬂow of impact 14. The
yellow box outlines the region used to compute the column den-
sity in Table 1.

et al. (2013), the evolution of the neutral hydrogen column den-
sity was calculated. The column density, given in Table 1, is the
average hydrogen column density of the highest 150 pixels 2-4
min before impact. The uncertainty is the corresponding vari-
ance. In Fig. 8, we show the column-density track of impact 14.
A yellow box shows the region from which the highest 150 col-
umn densities were selected to compute the column density for
the fragment. The actual number of pixels taken was not critical,
and we found similar column densities for 30% more or less pix-
els. We note that close to the solar surface the neutral hydrogen
column density decreases by at least a factor two, implying ion-
isation before impact. The ions will be trapped by the coronal
magnetic ﬁeld causing bright EUV emission outside the main
impact site (see movie impact15).

The range of column densities, a factor four, is much smaller
than the range of 171 Å intensities. It is probably not the main
parameter in determining the 171 Å intensity but as discussed
below it may play a factor in determining IUV /IEUV.

4.3. Magnetic ﬁeld

We have looked at the relationship of the impacts’ intensities to
the local ﬁeld at the impact site. The majority of impacts oc-
curred in quiet Sun and we include one impact on the edge of an
active region (9) and one low column-density impact in a coronal
hole region (15).

The images of impacts towards the coronal hole show bright
EUV threads that were probably illuminating the structure of the
magnetic ﬁeld on the edge of the coronal hole. They are best seen
in the movie, impact15 movie. Here one sees one dark fragment
to the south and a broad, very faint fragment heading towards
the coronal hole. Fig. 9 gives an overview of the downﬂows and
impacts. The downﬂow track and 1600 Å emission in Fig. 9(a)
and the southern 171 Å emission in (c) is impact 14. The display
of brightenings on the edge of the coronal hole seen in (d) are
grouped together as impact 15. They were produced by a faint
sheet-like fragment that is not visible in individual images but
can be seen in impact15 movie. Although there were no high
column-density fragments associated with the EUV threads, they
were as bright in the EUV as the neighbouring impact caused by
a high column-density impact in the chromosphere.

and the increase in I193/I171 for later impacts.

The impact in the active region, impact 9, was similar to the
low column-density impact in that it produced lower IUV /IEUV
for its velocity than impacts in the quiet-Sun chromosphere. The
accompanying movie of the impact, impact9 movie, shows that
it started as a high column-density fragment that, about 3 min
before impact, dispersed in the corona as it crossed a region af-
fected by an earlier small splash. An overview of the impact is
provided by Fig. 10. The images show a bright fan-shaped region
of EUV emission at the impact site and very little UV, implying
that the downfalling fragment dissipated its kinetic energy in the
corona and did not reach the chromosphere.

4.4. Splashes

EUV splashes were seen after several of the impacts in the quiet
Sun. They mostly appeared where the impacting fragment was
unusually long or wide. Several of the splashes were as bright
as the impact itself in the 171 Å channel. The main features of

quiet-Sun splashes are illustrated by the biggest sequence of im-
pacts that started around 08:00 UT and had an impact speed
about 400 km s−1. As shown in impact12 movie, there were
two successive streams of impacts following roughly the same
path. The ﬁrst stream, shown in the right and middle panels of
Fig. 11, produced the ‘region 1’ investigated by Gilbert et al.
(2013). Where the impact was in the chromosphere, the landing
site brightened in all channels (UV and EUV). The splash, rep-
resented in the lower images of the middle panel, moved back
towards the inﬂowing material with a plane-of-sky velocity of
about 100 km s−1. The eﬀect of the splash on the second stream
was to prevent the impacting fragment from reaching the chro-
mosphere. As shown in the top-left image of the the right-hand
panel of Fig. 11, little UV emission was produced by the second
stream. For comparison, the splash structure simulated by Reale
et al. (2014) had a speed of 200 km s−1 and was more extended
in the direction away from the infalling plasma.

parts of the downﬂows on the edge of the main downﬂow, dissi-
pated in the lower corona producing bright EUV emission (e.g.
the region in (f) marked with a white arrow). The splash ap-
peared later and was visible in the EUV channels. Compared
with the neighbouring low column-density impacts dissipating
in the corona, the splash had a higher I171/I193 (or I171/I211). This
implies that the splash was cooler than the impacts dissipating in
the corona.

The light curves of the 1600, and 193 Å emission, ob-
tained by integrating base-diﬀerence intensities over the whole
region, are shown in Fig. 13. The head of the fragment pro-
duced the brightening around 12 min seen in the 1600 Å image
(Fig. 12(e)). The impacts 12 and 13 caused the series of spiky
brightenings between 17 and 22 min. A broader, more gradual
increase of 1600 Å emission occurred around 37 min. The im-
ages show that this is because there were many small, barely
perceptible brightenings at 1600 Å (Fig. 12(m)) coinciding with
the EUV impact emission from the second stream. We note that
there was no bright 1600 Å emission in the corona contrary to the
predictions by Reale et al. (2014). This may be because the den-
sity of the observed fragments was lower than those simulated by
Reale et al. (2014). They assumed spherical fragments with den-
sity 5× 1010 cm−3 and radii 1.4− 2.6× 108 cm , whereas the dark
fragments in Fig 12 have widths of typically 8× 108 cm and col-
umn densities 3.7× 1018 cm−2 which corresponds to a density of
about 5× 109 cm−3. The observed fragments may therefore have
had a factor ten or so lower density than the simulated ones, and
this could explain why the fragments rapidly ionise in the corona
and produce very little 1600 Å emission.

There are subtle diﬀerences in the 171 and 193 Å intensities
that can be attributed to the eﬀects of the low column-density im-
pacts and the splashes. The low column-density impacts caused
the early increase in the 193 Å intensity and the bump in the
193 Å intensity around 25 min. The splash was responsible for
the increased 171 Å intensity immediately after the impacts at
20 and 40 min. The decrease in 171 Å intensity at the beginning
is because the falling fragment obscured bright 171 Å emission
during its descent.

A second large impact with interesting splash eﬀects in the
1600 Å and various EUV channels is shown in Fig. 14. This was
the only impact in our study with structured 1600 Å suggest-

ing bright C iv emission from falling material above the chro-
mosphere especially as it was seen along the front of a sec-
ond stream of infalling plasma (Reale et al. 2014). The bright-
est sites, indicated with white arrows in Fig. 14, were probably
chromospheric impacts because they produced circular brighten-
ings at 1700 Å as well. The threads in between have much lower
I1700/I1600, indicating transition region emission. These threads
are unlikely to have been caused by scattered impacts in the
chromosphere. It was also the lowest velocity impact. Thus con-
sistent with high IUV /IEUV observed in low-velocity impacts in
the quiet chromosphere we see that low-velocity impacts dissi-
pating higher in the atmosphere also have higher IUV /IEUV. The
high I211/I171 at the same site suggests that the 1600 Å was from
the impacting plasma not from the splash. The splash can be seen
in impact1 movie propagating back from the impact site in the
direction of the falling material.

5. Discussion
We have studied the UV and EUV emission of 16 ﬁlament frag-
ments that fell onto the Sun after the 2011 June 7 eruption with
impact velocities ranging from 230 - 450 km s−1 assuming ballis-
tic propagation: an assumption that has been justiﬁed by stereo-
scopically tracking the path of one fragment in EUVI-A and
AIA images. The impacts range over two orders of magnitude
in 171 Å intensity, and had column densities ranging from less
than 1.5 to 7.7×1018 cm−2. All impacts produced bright EUV
emission and the strength of the IUV /IEUV emission depended
on impact velocity, column density, magnetic environment, and
presence of splashes caused by earlier impacts.

For impacts in the quiet Sun not aﬀected by splashes, the
IUV /IEUV decreased with velocity. This suggests that at low
velocities there was not as much impact energy to heat and
ionise all plasma at the impact site to coronal temperatures
so the IUV /IEUV was relatively large (Sacco et al. 2010). The
lowest column-density impact had the highest I193/I171 suggest-
ing that low density impacts result in higher temperature emis-
sion. Image sequences of the plasma during the largest quiet-
Sun impact (Fig. 12) showed the same tendency. We suspect
that the reduced IUV /IEUV was because low density ﬁlaments
become essentially fully ionised before reaching the chromo-
sphere. Therefore the impacting plasma was trapped in the
corona and did not reach the chromosphere. Since the coronal
density was low, the impact rapidly heated the coronal plasma to
temperatures above 2 MK, and conduction transported the heat
down to the chromosphere. In contrast, the kinetic energy of im-
pacts into the high-density, low-temperature chromosphere was
concentrated at the impact site creating a large increase in local
pressure (Reale et al. 2013). The dissipated energy heated the
local chromosphere from less than 0.01 to more than 3 MK, re-
sulting in a broad range of emission temperatures, with a bias
towards the cooler coronal values.

Dissipation in the corona also explains the emission ob-
served from impact 9 in the active region. Compared to impacts
with the same velocity in the quiet Sun, the I193/I171 was higher
and the IUV /IEUV lower. Also one sees in impact9 movie that
the EUV emission spreads forward whereas in the higher den-
sity quiet-Sun cases the EUV emission brightened at the impact
site and/or splashed backwards. Probably near the active region
the falling material was ionised when still high in the corona.
Thus it was trapped and dissipated in the magnetic structures in
the corona. The column density of the active-region fragment
was relatively high and if falling directly onto the quiet Sun, it

should have created a UV kernel. It may have been ionised either
by the increased EUV ﬂux from the active region or shocked,
heated and ionised by the splash from an earlier small impact
(see Section 4.3 and Fig 10).

Splashes were observed in several of the impacts (1, 4, 11,
12, 13). They are most visible at 171 Å, implying a temperature
slightly under 1 MK. Their plane-of-sky propagation velocity
was about 100 km s−1 which is roughly the sound speed in the
corona. When impacts fell into a previously created splash, they
dissipated in the corona creating hotter impact emission than in
the splash because the falling material was shock heated by the
back-ﬂowing high-pressure splash. Reale et al. (2014) suggested
that the shocked falling plasma may explain the redshifted C iv
emission seen in accretion ﬂows. Only the slow, large impact
stream produced 1600 Å emission in the falling plasma. Most
the observed fragments have lower column density and larger
size than the spherical fragments in the Reale et al. (2014) sim-
ulations which suggests that they were signiﬁcantly less dense.
This may be the reason that no 1600 Å emission was observed at
the head of the falling fragments when they hit a rising splash.
For impacts with velocity greater than about 300 km s−1 the
biggest inﬂuence on the impacts’ IUV /IEUV was the level of ion-
isation in the falling fragment since this determined whether the
fragment could penetrate to the chromosphere or was trapped
and dissipated in the coronal magnetic ﬁeld. If the fragments
reach the chromosphere as predicted by HD simulations (Sacco
et al. 2010; Reale et al. 2013) then UV emission which is only
weakly absorbed by overlying cool material, should have been
bright at all impacts sites. But in situations where the ionisa-
tion of the infalling fragment was high, we found only weak UV
emission. The IUV /IEUV decreased with impact velocity which
suggests that the ratio is more inﬂuenced by impact kinetic en-
ergy rather than absorbing column. Therefore, we think that if
the solar impacts are a good proxy for stellar accretion ﬂows,
absorption of EUV and X-ray emission at the impact site is not
a likely explanation for the lower accretion rates obtained by
analysis of X-ray compared with UV, visible and infrared obser-
vations. Rather, we agree with Bonito et al. (2014) that a more
plausible explanation for the absorption of X-rays is cool ma-
terial in the unperturbed accretion stream above the impact site.
Modelling of both the UV and EUV emission would give greater
understanding of the fragment and impact dynamics.
