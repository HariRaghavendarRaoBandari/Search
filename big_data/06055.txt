Abstract: We make predictions for the cross sections of diﬀractive dijet photoproduction
in pp, pA and AA ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) at the LHC during Runs 1 and 2 using
next-to-leading perturbative QCD. We ﬁnd that the resulting cross sections are suﬃciently
large and, compared to lepton–proton scattering at HERA, have an enhanced sensitivity
to small observed momentum fractions in the diﬀractive exchange, commonly denoted
zjets
IP , and an unprecedented reach in the invariant mass of the photon–nucleon system
W . We examine two competing schemes of diﬀractive QCD factorization breaking, which
assume either a global suppression factor or a suppression for resolved photons only and
demonstrate that the two scenarios can be distinguished by the nuclear dependence of the
distributions in the observed parton momentum fraction in the photon xjets

Introduction

Ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of relativistic ions are characterized by large transverse
distances (impact parameters) between the centers of the colliding ions, exceeding the sum
of their radii. For such collisions, the strong interaction is suppressed and the ions interact
electromagnetically through the emission of quasi-real photons [1–3]. The ﬂux of these
photons scales as Z 2, where Z is the nuclear charge, and has a broad energy spectrum with
the maximal photon energy in the laboratory frame scaling as γL, where γL is the nuclear
Lorentz factor. This allows one to study photon–photon and photon–nucleus scattering at
unprecedentedly high energies [4].

The UPC program at the LHC during Run 1 focused primarily on exclusive photo-
production of charmonia, in particular J/ψ and ψ(2S) mesons, which probes the gluon
distribution of the target g(x, µ2) at small values of the momentum fraction x and a res-
olution scale µ2 = O(few GeV2) [5]. This process was measured in proton–proton (pp)
collisions at √sN N = 7 TeV by the LHCb collaboration [6, 7], in proton–nucleus (pA)

– 1 –

collisions at √sN N = 5.02 TeV by the ALICE collaboration [8], and in Pb-Pb collisions
at √sN N = 2.76 TeV by the ALICE collaboration [9–11] (√sN N is the invariant collision
energy per nucleon). The analyses of these data at leading-order (LO) and next-to-leading
order (NLO) QCD have provided new constraints on the small-x behavior of the gluon dis-
tribution in the proton gp(x, µ2) down to x = 6× 10−6 [12, 13] and of the gluon distribution
in heavy nuclei gA(x, µ2) down to x ≈ 10−3 [14, 15]. The data also restrict the parameters
and the strong interaction dynamics of the color dipole model approach [16, 17] and the
STARlight Monte Carlo generator [18].

The LHCb collaboration also measured exclusive photoproduction of Υ mesons in pp
UPCs at √sN N = 7 and 8 TeV [19]; in perturbative QCD (pQCD), these data probe the
proton gluon distribution at the resolution scale µ2 = O(few tens GeV2) [12]. In addition,
coherent photoproduction of ρ mesons in nucleus–nucleus (AA) UPCs was measured by the
STAR collaboration at RHIC at √sN N = 64.4, 130 and 200 GeV [20–22] and by the ALICE
collaboration at √sN N = 2.76 TeV at the LHC [23]. These data probe the dynamics of
soft high-energy γp and γA interactions, see e.g. Ref. [24].

Another potentially interesting process, which can be studied in pp, pA and AA UPCs
at the LHC, is diﬀractive photoproduction of dijets, see Fig. 1. The measurement and
the QCD analysis of this process in pp and pA UPCs will continue and extend the studies
in lepton–proton scattering at HERA [25–33], giving a new handle on the key issue of
factorization breaking and providing additional information on the proton diﬀractive PDFs.
In AA (and to some degree pA) UPCs at the LHC, diﬀractive dijet photoproduction on
nuclei presents an open ﬁeld of research, which gives access to the novel unmeasured nuclear
diﬀractive PDFs and the nuclear dependence of factorization breaking. Note that studies
of diﬀractive dijet photoproduction in UPCs at the LHC are complimentary to those of
diﬀractive dijet production in proton–antiproton scattering at the Tevatron [34, 35] and in
proton–proton scattering at the LHC [36].

The outline of this paper is as follows: Sections 2, 3 and 4 contain our results for
the pp, pA and AA cases, respectively, which we present in the same order. First, we
give the general expression for the cross section of diﬀractive dijet photoproduction in the
considered UPC. Then we discuss its main ingredients, i.e. the photon ﬂux, the rapidity gap
survival probability and the diﬀractive parton distributions. Third, we give and discuss our
predictions for the cross sections of diﬀractive dijet photoproduction in UPCs in the LHC
kinematics for Runs 1 and 2. In Sec. 5, we discuss diﬀractive QCD factorization breaking
and study its eﬀect on our predictions. Finally, we summarize our results in Sec. 6. For
convenience, simple analytic ﬁts to the suppression factors used in our calculations in the
pp and pA cases are collected in the Appendix.

2 Diﬀractive dijet photoproduction in proton–proton UPCs at the LHC

The mechanism of diﬀractive dijet photoproduction in ultraperipheral collisions of relativis-
tic ions A and B is illustrated in Fig. 1. The ﬁgure shows the dominant leading-order (LO)

Figure 1. Typical leading-order Feynman graphs for diﬀractive dijet photoproduction in UPCs
of hadrons A and B. Graphs a and b correspond to the direct and resolved photon contributions,
respectively.

Considering proton–proton UPCs, A = B = p, the cross section of diﬀractive dijet

photoproduction can be written as a sum of two terms:

dσ(pp → p + 2jets + X ′ + Y ) = dσ(pp → p + 2jets + X ′ + Y )(+)
+ dσ(pp → p + 2jets + X ′ + Y )(−) ,

(2.1)

where X ′ stands for the produced diﬀractive ﬁnal state X after removing two jets and Y
denotes the ﬁnal state of the diﬀracting proton, which, besides the elastic state Y = p,
may contain hadronic states with low invariant mass. Note that the possibility of the
proton diﬀraction dissociation is not explicitly shown in Fig. 1. The ﬁrst and the second
terms in Eq. (2.1) correspond to the diﬀracting proton moving along the positive and the
negative z-axis, respectively. This reﬂects the ambiguity common for symmetric UPCs
that either of the colliding ions can serve as a photon source and as a target [4]. Since
the jet pseudorapidities η1 and η2 are usually deﬁned with respect to the direction of the
diﬀracting proton [37], the two terms in Eq. (2.1) can be related to each other by inverting
the sign of η1 and η2:

dσ(pp → p + 2jets + X ′ + Y )(−) = dσ(pp → p + 2jets + X ′ + Y )(+)

|η1→−η1, η2→−η2

.

(2.2)

The cross section dσ(pp → p + 2jets + X ′ + Y )(+) can be readily written by analogy
with the standard expression for the dijet diﬀractive photoproduction cross section dσ(ep →

where a and b are parton ﬂavors; fγ/p(y) is the ﬂux of equivalent photons of the proton,
which depends on the photon light-cone momentum fraction y; fa/γ(xγ, µ2) is the parton
distribution function (PDF) of the photon, which depends on the parton light-cone momen-
tum fraction xγ and the factorization scale µ; f D(4)
b/p (xIP , zIP , t, µ2) is the diﬀractive PDF
of the proton; dˆσ(n)
ab→jets is the elementary cross section for the production of an n-parton
ﬁnal state in the interaction of partons a and b; and the sum over a involves quarks and
gluons (the resolved photon contribution) and the direct photon contribution with a = γ,
which has support at LO only at xγ = 1.

In Eq. (2.3), besides the standard expression for ep scattering, we also explicitly intro-
duced the rapidity gap survival factor of S2(y) ≤ 1, which takes into account the probability
of soft inelastic interactions between the colliding protons, which populate, and thus sup-
press, the ﬁnal-state rapidity gaps. The factor of S2(y) depends on y and the total invariant
energy √sN N ; in pp UPCs, it can be viewed as a phenomenological factor modifying the
photon ﬂux fγ/p(y) [12, 39].

The QCD collinear factorization theorem for hard inclusive diﬀraction [40] allows one to
introduce universal diﬀractive PDFs f D(4)
b/p (xIP , zIP , t, µ2) and to determine them by ﬁtting
to the measured diﬀractive structure functions [41–43]. The analysis also shows that for
small values of xIP , f D(4)
b/p (xIP , zIP , t, µ2) can be written as the product of two factors [44]:

f D(4)
b/p (xIP , zIP , t, µ2) = fb/IP (zIP , µ2)fIP/p(xIP , t) ,

(2.4)

where fb/IP (zIP , µ2) is the PDF of the Pomeron (the lower blob in Fig. 1) and fIP/p(xIP , t) is
the Pomeron ﬂux (the double line in Fig. 1). Note that the word “Pomeron” here denotes
the diﬀractive exchange. Equation (2.4) helps to understand the meaning of the diﬀractive
variables zIP , xIP and t entering Eq. (2.3): zIP is the light-cone momentum fraction of a
parton in the Pomeron; xIP is the light-cone momentum fraction of the Pomeron in the
proton; t is the invariant momentum transfer squared.

In the measurements of diﬀractive dijet photoproduction in ep scattering, the variables
y, xIP and t are directly reconstructed by detecting the scattered electron, the ﬁnal proton
and the diﬀractive ﬁnal state, see e.g. [27]:

where p, pY , k, and q are the four-momenta of the initial proton, the ﬁnal proton (with the
possibility of diﬀraction dissociation into the state Y ), the initial lepton and the photon,

– 4 –

respectively; Ee, E′
e, and EX are the energies of the initial lepton, the ﬁnal lepton, and the
diﬀractive ﬁnal state X, respectively; PX,z and MX are the z-component of the momentum
and the invariant mass of the state X, respectively; and s = (k + p)2 is the square of the
total center-of-mass energy of the collision. In ep scattering at HERA, the limits on y, xIP
and t are determined by the experimental conditions and cuts. In contrast, in pp UPCs the
scattered protons travel along the beam pipe, and, hence, are undetected. As a result, the
limits on y, t and xIP in Eq. (2.3) are determined from general requirements to produce a
diﬀractive ﬁnal state.

The two remaining variables zIP and xγ in Eq. (2.3) cannot be directly reconstructed
by measuring the ﬁnal state; their values can be compared to the hadron-level estimators
zjets
IP and xjets
, respectively, which are reconstructed from the measurement of the dijet and
the diﬀractive ﬁnal state [27]:

2.2 Flux of equivalent photons in pp UPCs

The ﬂux of quasi-real photons emitted by a relativistic proton (ion) can be found using the
well-known Weizs¨acker–Williams (WW) approximation [1–3, 45, 46]. Since one also needs
to take into account the charge and magnetization distribution in the proton, in practical
applications one often uses approximate expressions [47, 48] reproducing the exact result
with a few percent accuracy, see the discussion in Ref. [49].

The photon ﬂux produced by a relativistic charge Z at the transverse distance b from

its center reads, see e.g. [46]:

(2.7)

where x is the fraction of the ion energy carried by the photon; αe.m. is the ﬁne-structure
constant; Fch(k2
⊥) is the charge form factor; k⊥ is the photon transverse momentum; J1 is
the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind; and mp is the proton mass. Diﬀerent expressions for
the photon ﬂux used in the literature correspond to various assumptions for Fch(k2
⊥) and
treatments of subleading terms in Eq. (2.7).

The integration of fγ/Z (x, b) over all impact parameters gives the following general

expression for the photon ﬂux produced by a relativistic ion:

where me is the electron mass; Q2
max is the maximal photon virtuality, which is usually
determined by the experimental conditions. Figure 2 presents a comparison of the spectrum
of equivalent photons of the proton with that of the electron. In the left panel, we show
xfγ/p(x) for the proton as a function of x (the red solid and the blue dot-dashed curves
corresponding to Eqs. (2.9) and (2.10), respectively) and xfγ/e(x) for the electron (the
dotted black curve corresponding to Eq. (2.11)). One can see from this panel that the
energy spectrum for the point-like electron is much ﬂatter than that for the composite
proton. The photon energy k scales as γLmp in the laboratory frame and as 2γ2
Lmp in the
target rest frame, where γL is the Lorentz factor of the emitting ion. The right panel of
Fig. 2 shows the photon spectra kfγ/p(k) and kfγ/e(k) as a function of the photon energy
k in the proton target rest frame. For the proton beam, the curves correspond to proton–
proton collisions at √sN N = 7 TeV. For the electron beam, the curve corresponds to the
HERA kinematics with the 27.5 GeV electron beam and the 920 GeV proton beam. One

– 6 –

can see from the panel that pp UPCs, in principle, allow one to obtain photon energies
exceeding those at HERA by two orders of magnitude.

We explained in Sec. 2.1 that the photon ﬂux fγ/p(x) is somewhat reduced by the
rapidity gap survival probability factor of S2(x). To estimate it, we use the method of
Refs. [12, 50], where S2(x) is calculated as a result of eikonalization of multiple Pomeron
exchanges between the colliding protons:

S2(x) = R d2b|M(x, b)|2P (s, b)

R d2b|M(x, b)|2

,

(2.12)

where b is the impact parameter; M(x, b) is the diﬀractive amplitude of the process of
interest in the impact parameter space; P (s, b) is the probability to not have the strong
inelastic proton–proton interaction at the impact parameter b; and s = sN N for brevity.

The probability P (s, b) in the two-channel eikonal model of Ref. [50] is

P (s, b) =

1

4(1 − γ2)h(1 + γ)3e−(1+γ)2Ω(s,b) + (1 − γ)3e−(1−γ)2Ω(s,b)
+ 2(1 − γ2)e−(1−γ2)Ω(s,b)i ,

(2.13)

where γ = 0.4 and Ω(s, b) is the proton optical density. Assuming that Ω(s, b) has the form
of the eﬀective Pomeron exchange trajectory, one obtains:

Ω(s, b) = α

σtot
pp (s)
4πBP

e−b2/(4BP ),

pp (s) is the total proton–proton cross section; BP = B0/2 + α′ ln(s/s0) is the slope
where σtot

eikonalized multiple Pomeron exchanges and is found from the requirement:

e−(1−γ2)Ω(s,b)/2(cid:21) .

(2.15)

For σtot
pp (s), we use the ﬁt of the Review of Particle Physics [51]. The resulting values
of S2(x) weakly depend on the exact value of the slope BP ; in our calculation, we used
B0 = 10 GeV−2 and α′ = 0.25 GeV−2, which correctly reproduce the slope of the elastic
pp cross section at small |t| [50].
For |M(x, b)|2 in Eq. (2.12), we use the photon ﬂux of the proton in the impact
parameter space, Eq. (2.7), with Fch(Q2) = Fp(Q2) = 1/(1 + Q2/(0.71 GeV2))2. Since the
contribution of small impact parameters b < bmin ≈ 0.7 fm to the photon ﬂux, Eq. (2.7), is
small, the integrand in Eq. (2.12) receives the dominant contribution from b > bmin, where
Ω(s, b) is not large. As a result, one expects that the suppression due to S2(x) should not
be large.

The resulting values of S2(x) as a function of the photon light-cone momentum frac-
tion x are shown in Fig. 3. The red solid curve corresponds to √sN N = 7 TeV, and the
blue dashed curve is for √sN N = 13 TeV. Since larger values of x correspond eﬀectively to
smaller values of the impact parameter b, where the suppression due to the strong inter-
action is stronger, S2(x) decreases with an increase of x. Also, the suppression somewhat

increases with an increase of the invariant collision energy √sN N as a result of the increase
of σtot
pp (s) and the optical density Ω(s, b). For convenience, a simple ﬁt to the curves in
Fig. 3 is given in the Appendix. Note that our values of S2(x) are consistent with the
results for S2(x) for exclusive photoproduction of J/ψ and Υ mesons in pp UPCs [12] and
also with the results of the calculation using a simpler model for the rapidity gap survival
of Ref. [52].

2.3 Results

We performed next-to-leading order (NLO) pQCD calculations implementing the inclusive
kT -cluster algorithm [33] of the cross section of diﬀractive photoproduction of dijets in pp
UPCs, Eq. (2.1), using the following cuts (compare to the cuts used, e.g., in Ref. [27]):

Ejet2

T > 18 GeV ,

0 < y < 1 ,
Ejet1
T > 20 GeV ,
−6 < ηjet1,2 < −6 ,
zjets
xIP ≤ 0.03 ,
IP ≤ 1 ,
MY ≤ 1.6 GeV ,

|t| < 1 GeV2 ,

T

where Ejet1,2
and ηjet1,2 are the transverse energies and the pseudorapidities of the two
jets, respectively. For input, we used the DZ photon ﬂux of the proton, Eq. (2.9), modiﬁed
by the rapidity gap survival probability S2(y), Eq. (2.12), the GRV-HO photon PDFs [53],
and the 2006 H1 proton diﬀractive PDFs (ﬁt B) [42].

Figures 4 and 5 show the resulting diﬀractive dijet photoproduction cross sections for
pp UPCs at √sN N = 7 TeV and √sN N = 13 TeV, respectively. Diﬀerent panels present

when the renormalization and factorization scale µ is identiﬁed with the transverse energy

uncertainty of our NLO calculations associated with the choice of the factorization and
renormalization scales. One can see from the ﬁgures that for our choice of Ejet1
T > 20 GeV,
this uncertainty is rather insigniﬁcant.

Several features of the presented results merit discussion and comparison to diﬀractive
dijet photoproduction in ep scattering at HERA [25–27]. First, the predicted yields are
comparable to those observed in the ep case; the integrated cross section is O(hundreds pb)
at √sN N = 7 TeV and O(few nb) at √sN N = 13 TeV. Second, while the general trends of

the dependence on various variables are similar in the pp UPC and ep cases, the former al-
lows to probe values of W exceeding those achieved in the ep case by at least a factor of ten
and to produce dijets with the signiﬁcantly larger M12 and MX . In addition, the contribu-
tion of the low-zjets
IP region is much more important in the pp UPC case than in the ep case,
which signals the enhanced sensitivity to the proton diﬀractive PDFs f D(4)
b/p (xIP , zIP , t, µ2)
at small zIP , where they are poorly constrained [41–43].

It is interesting to speculate that the large cross section of diﬀractive dijet photopro-
duction in pp UPCs at small zjets
IP might contribute to hard diﬀractive dijet production
in pp scattering at large log10(x−
IP ) and cause the dependence of the suppression factor
parametrizing the rapidity gap survival probability on the momentum fraction of the par-
ton in the Pomeron [35, 54].

In the experiment, to trigger on the events corresponding to diﬀractive dijet photopro-
duction in UPCs, one should employ the selection criteria typical for diﬀractive scattering
in photoproduction: the absence of hadronic activity adjacent to the beam directions
(presence of large rapidity gaps) will correspond to (very) small transverse momenta of the
ﬁnal-state protons (ions) and guarantee that the exchanged photon is quasi-real and that
the photon–target interaction is diﬀractive; the detector will register two hard jets with
large pT and possibly the forward energy ﬂow from the remnant diﬀractive ﬁnal state (see
Fig. 1).

3 Diﬀractive dijet photoproduction in proton–nucleus UPCs at the LHC

3.1 General expression for the cross section

Taking one of the ions in Fig. 1 to be a nucleus and the other one to be the proton, the
cross section of diﬀractive dijet photoproduction in pA UPCs reads (see Eq. (2.1)):

dσ(pA → p/A + 2jets + X ′ + Y ) = dσ(pA → A + 2jets + X ′ + Y )(+)
+ dσ(pA → p + 2jets + X ′ + Y )(−) .

(3.1)

The ﬁrst term in Eq. (3.1) corresponds to the process, when the photon ﬂux is produced
by the nucleus and the diﬀractive photoproduction of dijets takes place on the proton:

dσ(pA → A + 2jets + X ′ + Y )(+) = Xa,b

Equation (3.2) is obtained from Eq. (2.3) by replacing the photon ﬂux of the proton fγ/p(y)
by the photon ﬂux of the nucleus fγ/A(y) and eﬀectively absorbing in it the factor of S2(y).
The second term in Eq. (3.1) corresponds to the process, when the photon ﬂux is
produced by the proton and the diﬀractive photoproduction of dijets takes place on the
nucleus:

dσ(pA → p + 2jets + X ′ + Y )(−) = Xa,b

(3.3)

where f D(4)
b/A is the diﬀractive PDF on a nucleus [55]; it a novel, yet unmeasured distribution.
Note that the photon ﬂux fγ/p(y) in Eq. (3.3) corresponds to pA UPCs and includes
the eﬀect of the suppression of the strong photon–nucleus interaction at central impact
parameters (see Sec. 3.2).

In Eqs. (3.2) and (3.3), the jet pseudorapidities η1 and η2 are deﬁned with respect
to the direction of the diﬀracting hadron. Therefore, dσ(pA → p + 2jets + X ′ + Y )(−) is
obtained from dσ(pA → A + 2jets + X ′ + Y )(+) by the appropriate replacements of the
photon ﬂux and the diﬀractive PDFs as explained above and the inversion of the sign of
η1 and η2: η1,2 → −η1,2 (compare to Eq. (2.2)).

It is important to point out that for most of the observables or in the case of the
integrated cross section, the pA UPC cross section Eq. (3.1) is dominated by the ﬁrst term
dσ(pA → A + 2jets + X ′ + Y )(+). Indeed, while the photon ﬂux of a nucleus scales as Z 2,
where Z is the nucleus charge, see, e.g. Eq. (2.10), the diﬀractive PDFs of a nucleus after
integration over the momentum transfer t scale only as A4/3 in the impulse approximation;
they are also further suppressed by nuclear shadowing [55]. Therefore, pA UPCs can
be used to primarily study diﬀractive photoproduction of dijets on the proton by taking
advantage of the dramatically enhanced intensity of the photon ﬂux compared to pp UPCs.
The same situation arises in exclusive photoproduction of J/ψ mesons in pA UPCs at the
LHC at √sN N = 5.02 TeV [8].

3.2 Flux of equivalent photons in pA UPCs

To calculate the photon ﬂux in pA UPCs, one needs to take into account the suppression of
the strong interaction between the colliding proton and the nucleus. The resulting photon
ﬂux of the ultrarelativistic nucleus reads, see e.g. [56]:

fγ/A(x) = Z d2b ΓpA(b)fγ/A(x, b) ,

(3.4)

where b is the impact parameter (the transverse distance between the centers of mass of
the nucleus and the proton); ΓpA(b) is the probability to not have the strong pA interaction
at the impact parameter b; and fγ/A(x, b) is the impact parameter dependent photon ﬂux
of the nucleus. The probability ΓpA(b) is given by the standard expression of the Glauber
model for high-energy proton–nucleus scattering [57]:

ΓpA(b) = e−σtot

N N (s)TA(b) ,

parameter Fermi model parametrization for ρA(b, z) [58], and Eq. (2.7) for fγ/A(x, b).

N N (s) is the total nucleon–nucleon cross section; TA(b) = R dzρA(b, z) is the nuclear
optical density, where ρA is the density of nucleons; and R d2b TA(b) = A, where A is the

using Eqs. (3.4) and (3.5); the blue dot-dashed curve (“FF”) corresponds to setting ΓpA(b) = 1 in
Eq. (3.4); the dotted curve (“PL”) is the ﬂux of a point-like charge, Eq. (2.10), with bmin = 1.15RA.
Right: The photon spectrum xfγ/p(x) of the proton in pA UPCs. For the labels, see the left panel
and text.

In practice, the result of the full calculation can be approximated very well (with a few
percent accuracy) by the photon ﬂux of a point-like charge Eq. (2.10) with bmin = 1.15RA,

– 13 –

where RA = 1.145A1/3 ≈ 6.8 fm is the equivalent sharp radius of 208Pb. The corresponding
ﬂux is given by the dotted curve labeled “PL”, which is indistinguishable from the red solid
curve. Note that since ΓpA(b) is a slow function of sN N in the considered energy range, it is
a good approximation to use bmin = 1.15RA both at √sN N = 5.02 TeV and √sN N = 8.16
TeV, the tentative Run-2 energy of pA collisions at the LHC.

The photon ﬂux of the proton in pA UPCs can be found using Eq. (3.4), where one re-
places fγ/A(x, b) by fγ/p(x, b). The result is shown by the red solid curve labeled “FF+sup”
in the right panel of Fig. 6. For comparison, the blue dot-dashed curve labeled “FF” shows
the result, when one sets ΓpA = 1. Note that this curve coincides with the “DZ” and
“PL” curves of Fig. 2 to a few percent accuracy. For convenience, in the Appendix we give
a simple analytic form of the factor of f sup
(x) parametrizing the diﬀerence between the
“FF+sup” and “FF” curves shown in the right panel of Fig. 6. Note that f sup
(x) does not
change when one increases √sN N from √sN N = 5.02 TeV to √sN N = 8.16 TeV to better
than a fraction of a percent accuracy.

One can readily see from Fig. 6 that fγ/A(x) is larger than fγ/p(x) by approximately
a factor of 5, 000 due to the Z 2 factor in Eq. (2.7). This enhancement of the dσ(pA →
A + 2jets + X ′ + Y )(+) term in Eq. (3.2) wins over the nuclear enhancement of nuclear
diﬀractive PDFs (see below) entering the dσ(pA → p + 2jets + X ′ + Y )(−) term. As a
result, the process, when the photon ﬂux is produced by the nucleus, dominates the cross
section of pA UPCs unless one probes very large values of W and hηjetsi (see the results
and discussion in Sec. 3.4).

3.3 Nuclear diﬀractive PDFs

The nuclear diﬀractive PDFs f D(4)
b/A (xIP , zIP , t, µ2) entering the dσ(pA → p + 2jets + X ′ +
Y )(−) term in Eq. (3.2) are conditional leading twist PDFs giving the distribution of a
parton b in a nucleus in terms of the light-cone momentum fraction zIP at the resolution
scale µ, provided that the nucleus undergoes diﬀractive scattering characterized by the
light-cone momentum fraction loss xIP and the invariant momentum transfer squared t.

In the impulse approximation (IA), when the only nuclear eﬀect is nuclear coherence,

f D(4)
b/A (xIP , zIP , t, µ2) reads:

f D(4),IA
b/A

(xIP , zIP , t, µ2) = A2F 2

A(t)f D(4)

b/p (xIP , zIP , tmin, µ2) ,

(3.6)

where FA(t) is the nuclear form factor and tmin = −(xIP mp)2/(1 − xIP ) is the minimal
momentum transfer.

At high energies, the hard probe interacts coherently (simultaneously) with all nucle-
ons of a nuclear target, which results in the eﬀect of nuclear shadowing reducing nuclear
PDFs compared to their IA expressions. In particular, the model of leading twist nuclear
shadowing predicts a very signiﬁcant suppression of nuclear diﬀractive PDFs [55], which
can be quantiﬁed by the suppression factor of Rb(xIP , zIP , µ2):

b/A (xIP , zIP , t, µ2) = Rb(xIP , zIP , µ2)f D(4),IA
f D(4)

b/A

(xIP , zIP , t, µ2) .

(3.7)

– 14 –

Note that nuclear shadowing of nuclear diﬀractive PDFs breaks the phenomenological
factorization Eq. (2.4) of diﬀractive PDFs into the product of the “Pomeron” ﬂux and
PDFs of the “Pomeron”.

Predictions for Rb(xIP , zIP , µ2) [55] for sea quarks for the representative ranges of zIP
and xIP and at µ2 = 400 GeV2 are shown in Fig. 7. An analysis reveals that Rb(xIP , zIP , µ2)
very weakly depends on the parton ﬂavor b, the scale µ, zIP and xIP (the latter is seen from
Fig. 7). Therefore, in practical estimates, it is a good approximation to use the constant
suppression factor:

Rb(xIP , zIP , µ2) ≈ 0.15 .

3.4 Results

We performed NLO calculations of the cross section of diﬀractive photoproduction of dijets
in pA UPCs at √sN N = 5.02 TeV and √sN N = 8.16 TeV using the cuts of Eq. (2.16). The
results are presented in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively.

and µ = Ejet1

In these ﬁgures, the blue solid and dotted lines give the net result of Eq. (3.1); the red
dot-dashed lines show the contribution of the second term dσ(pA → p + 2jets + X ′ + Y )(−)
in Eq. (3.1) corresponding to the photon ﬂux emitted by the proton. The blue solid and
red dot-dashed lines correspond to µ = Ejet1
; the two blue dotted lines surrounding each
solid line correspond to µ = 2Ejet1
T /2, respectively, which demonstrates the
theoretical uncertainty of our predictions associated with the choice of the renormalization
and factorization scale. One can see from the ﬁgures that this uncertainty is not signiﬁcant.
A comparison of our predictions for pA UPCs shown in Figs. 8 and 9 to those for pp
UPCs shown in Figs. 4 and 5 demonstrates that the general trends for the dependence of
the cross section on various variables are similar in the pp and pA cases: very roughly, the
pA results can be obtained from the pp ones by multiplying them by the scaling factor
of (1/2)Z 2(0.7 fm/RA) ≈ 350, where took into account that the photon spectra of the
proton and a nucleus extend up to x ∼ 1/bmin = 1/(0.7 fm) and bmin ∼ 1/RA, respectively,

– 15 –

and that in the pA UPC cross section, the contribution of the minus-term in Eq. (3.1) is
generally small. Note that in the two upper panels of Figs. 8 and 9, the physical units
along the y-axis are nb.

T

T

At the same time, there are marked diﬀerences between the pA and pp results. First,
the cross section falls oﬀ faster as one increases Ejet1
or W in the pA case than in the pp
case because the photon ﬂux of a heavy ultrarelativistic nucleus decreases with an increase
of the photon energy much faster than the photon ﬂux of the proton. This also explains
why at large values of Ejet1
and W , the cross section is dominated by the photon-from-
proton contribution (the term dσ(pA → p + 2jets + X ′ + Y )(−) in Eq. (3.1) corresponding
to the photon ﬂux emitted by the proton).
Second, unlike the symmetric hηjetsi distribution in pp UPCs, this distribution is not
symmetric in the case of pA UPCs. Indeed, at central and backward dijet rapidities, the
dominant contribution to the cross section in Eq. (3.1) comes from low-energy photons
emitted by the nucleus. At the same time, forward dijet rapidities correspond to high-
energy photons emitted by the nucleus, where the photon ﬂux is very small, or to low-
energy photons emitted by the proton; the latter contribution dominates the cross section
for suﬃciently large positive hηjetsi.

Note that without the eﬀect of nuclear shadowing in nuclear diﬀractive PDFs, the
photon-from-proton contribution (the red dot-dashed curves in Figs. 8 and 9) would be
globally larger by a factor of 1/0.15 ≈ 7 (cf. Eq. (3.8)), with a weak dependence on zIP and
xIP (cf. Fig. 7).

4 Diﬀractive dijet photoproduction in nucleus–nucleus UPCs at the LHC

4.1 General expression for the cross section

Considering nucleus–nucleus UPCs, we can readily write down the cross section of coherent
diﬀractive dijet photoproduction (compare to Eqs. (2.1) and (3.1)):

dσ(AA → A + 2jets + X ′ + A) = dσ(AA → A + 2jets + X ′ + A)(+)
+ dσ(AA → A + 2jets + X ′ + A)(−) .

(4.1)

Note that we considered the case of coherent nuclear scattering when both nuclei remain
intact after either the photon emission or hard dijet photoproduction.

By analogy with the pp and pA cases considered above, each term in Eq. (4.1) can
be written as a convolution of the photon ﬂux of an ultrarelativistic nucleus fγ/A(y), the
PDF of the photon fa/γ, the nuclear diﬀractive PDFs f D(4)
b/A , and the hard elementary cross
section dˆσ(n)
ab→jets, see Eqs. (2.3), (3.2) and (3.3). For instance, one obtains for the ﬁrst
term:

dσ(AA → A + 2jets + X ′ + A)(+) = Xa,b
× fγ/A(y)fa/γ(xγ, µ2)f D(4)

(4.2)

For symmetric (equal beam-energy) AA UPCs that we consider in our work, the second
and ﬁrst terms in Eq. (4.1) are related by a sign exchange of the dijet rapidities:

dσ(AA → A + 2jets + X ′ + A)(−) = dσ(AA → A + 2jets + X ′ + A)(+)

|η1→−η1, η2→−η2

. (4.3)

4.2 Flux of equivalent photons in AA UPCs

In the calculation of the photon ﬂux produced by each ultrarelativistic nucleus in AA UPCs,
one needs to suppress the strong nucleus–nucleus interaction. The resulting expression for
the photon ﬂux fγ/A(x) is

fγ/A(x) = Z d2b ΓAA(b)fγ/A(x, b) ,

(4.4)

where fγ/A(x, b) is the impact parameter dependent photon ﬂux of the nucleus (2.7) and
ΓAA(b) is the probability for the nuclei to not interact strongly at the impact parameter b.
It is given by the standard expression of the Glauber model for high-energy nucleus–nucleus
scattering:

ΓAA(b) = exp(cid:18)−σtot

N N (s)Z d2~b1TA(~b)TA(~b1 − ~b)(cid:19) .

(4.5)

An analysis shows that the result of the calculation of the photon ﬂux using the exact
expression of Eq. (4.4) can be very well approximated by the much simpler expression for
the photon ﬂux produced by a relativistic point-like charge Z in Eq. (2.10), when one uses
bmin ≈ 2RA for the minimal impact parameter, where RA is the equivalent sharp nucleus

radius. Therefore, in our analysis of Pb-Pb UPCs at the LHC, we used Eq. (2.10) for
the Pb photon ﬂux in Eq. (4.2) with bmin ≈ 2.1RA = 14.2 fm [49]. The resulting photon
spectrum xfγ/A(x) as a function of the energy fraction x is shown in Fig. 10. Note that
in our analysis we assume that fγ/A(x) does not change when one increases the invariant
collision energy from √sN N = 2.76 TeV to √sN N = 5.1 TeV, the tentative Run-2 energy
of AA collisions at the LHC.

4.3 Results

The results of our NLO calculations of the cross section of diﬀractive photoproduction of
dijets in AA UPCs at √sN N = 2.76 TeV and √sN N = 5.1 TeV are presented in Figs. 11
and 12, respectively. In the calculations, use used the cuts of Eq. (2.16). As in the pp and
pA cases, the blue solid lines correspond to the µ = Ejet1
choice of the renormalization
and factorization scale; the two dot-dashed lines surrounding the solid one correspond
to µ = 2Ejet1
T /2 and, thus, illustrate the theoretical uncertainty of our
calculations associated with the choice of the two scales.

One can see from these ﬁgures that the general trends of the dependence of the cross
section of diﬀractive dijet photoproduction in AA UPCs resemble closely those already
observed in the pp and pA and can be obtained approximately by simple rescaling. For
instance, a comparison of the AA results at √sN N = 5.1 TeV with the pA results at
√sN N = 8.16 TeV (corresponding to the same nucleus beam energy), one ﬁnds that the
scaling factor between the distributions in the two cases is approximately A.
In this
estimate, we took into account that in the bulk of the considered kinematics, one has the
approximate relation f D(3)
j/p (xIP , zIP , µ2) between the nucleus and
proton diﬀractive PDFs, integrated over the momentum transfer t, (see Eqs. (3.6)–(3.8)),
and that the AA UPC cross section receives contributions of both nuclei, while the pA
UPC cross section is dominated by the photon-from-nucleus contribution.

j/A (xIP , zIP , µ2) ≈ A/2f D(3)

– 20 –

Note that the strong nuclear shadowing suppresses nuclear diﬀractive PDFs by the
factor of 0.15, see Eq. (3.8); without this eﬀect, i.e., in the impulse approximation, our
results in Figs. 11 and 12 would be increased approximately by the factor of seven.

5 Factorization breaking in diﬀractive dijet photoproduction

It is well known from studies of diﬀractive photoproduction of dijets in ep scattering at
HERA that collinear factorization for this process is broken, i.e., NLO pQCD calculations
overestimate the measured cross sections by almost a factor of two [25–33]. However, the
pattern of this factorization breaking remains unknown and presents one of the outstanding
questions in this ﬁeld: the data and the theory can be made consistent by introducing either
the global suppression factor of R(glob.) ≈ 0.5 or the suppression factor of R(res.) ≈ 0.4
only for the resolved photon contribution.

In addition, the HERA data on diﬀractive photoproduction of open charm [59] are
in agreement with NLO pQCD calculations, which is consistent with diﬀractive QCD fac-
torization. This agreement can be interpreted as an indication of absence of factorization
breaking for the direct photon contribution and the charm-quark part of the resolved pho-
ton contribution to the dijet photoproduction cross section. Hence, it challenges the global
suppression scenario of diﬀractive factorization breaking.

Factorization breaking in diﬀractive dijet photoproduction results from soft inelastic
photon interactions with the proton (nucleus), which populate and thus partially destroy
the ﬁnal-state rapidity gap. Thus, it has exactly the same nature as the rapidity gap
survival probability S2, which we discussed above in relation to pp UPCs, see Eq. (2.12).
At high energies, the photon interacts with protons and nuclei by ﬂuctuating into vari-
ous hadronic conﬁgurations (components) interacting with the target with diﬀerent cross
sections. Thus, it is natural to put forward the following physics scenario [60]:
for the
direct photon contribution, corresponding to weakly-interacting (point-like) ﬂuctuations
of the photon, factorization holds; for the resolved photon contribution corresponding to
large-size photon ﬂuctuations interacting with a typical vector meson–nucleon cross sec-
tion, factorization is broken, which leads to the suppression factor of R(res.) ≈ 0.3 − 0.4.
Note that beyond the leading order of pQCD, the separations of the direct and resolved
contributions is ambiguous and depends on the factorization scheme and the factorization
scale [31, 37]; in the present work, we use the conventions of [33].

Our results presented so far in Figs. 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12 assume no factorization
breaking. Based on the observations and arguments summarized above, we will test the
following two competing scenarios of diﬀractive QCD factorization breaking and implement
them in our predictions for the cross section of diﬀractive dijet photoproduction: ﬁrst, we
assume the global suppression factor of R(glob.) = 0.5 for the proton target and R(glob.) =
0.1 for the nucleus target (the latter value is somewhat ad hoc, but reﬂects the important
observation that it is much easier to break the nucleus than the proton, see Fig. 13 and
its discussion below); second, we assume that the resolved photon contribution enters with
the suppression factor of R(res.), while the direct photon contribution is unsuppressed.
To estimate R(res.), we use the appropriate application of the two-state eikonal model
of [50, 61] (compare to Eq. (2.12)):

R(res.) = R d2b|AγT →V T (W, b)|2PV T (W, b)

R d2b|AγT →V T (W, b)|2

,

(5.1)

– 24 –

where T stands for the proton or nucleus target; V denotes the hadron-like ﬂuctuation (com-
ponent) of the photon, which is assumed to be represented by the ρ meson; AγT →V T (W, b)
is the γT → V T amplitude in impact parameter space; PV T (W, b) is the probability to not
have the strong inelastic vector meson–target interaction at the impact parameter b; and
W is the invariant photon–nucleon energy.

For the proton target, we use

|Aγp→V p(W, b)|2 = e−b2/B(W )|Aγp→V p(W, b = 0)|2 ,

(5.2)

where B(W ) is the slope of the t-dependence of the γp → ρp cross section. A ﬁt to
the available HERA data gives B(W ) = [11 + 0.5 ln(W/W0)2] GeV−2, where W0 = 72
GeV [62, 63].

For the probability PV p(W, b), we use Eqs. (2.13) and (2.14), where in the expression
for the proton optical density, we substitute the total proton–proton cross section σtot
pp (s)
by the ρ meson–nucleon cross section σρN (W ). Since we are interested in the large values
of W > 100 GeV well beyond the HERA reach, we use in our analysis the following simple
and conservative extrapolation:

σρN (W ) = 26(cid:18) W 2

W 2

0 (cid:19)0.08

mb ,

(5.3)

where W0 = 100 GeV. The value of σρN (W ) at W = 100 GeV agrees with the analysis of
Ref. [24].

To ﬁnd R(res.) for the nuclear target, we calculate AγA→V A(W, b) in Eq. (5.1) using
the Glauber model of nuclear shadowing for coherent photoproduction of vector mesons on
nuclei in the high-energy limit, see e.g. [64]:

AγA→V A(W, b) =

e

fV (cid:18)1 − e−

σρN (W )

2

TA(b)(cid:19) ,

(5.4)

where TA(b) is the nuclear optical density normalized to the number of nucleons A and
f 2
V /(4π) = 2.01 is the photon–ρ meson coupling constant determined from the ρ → e+e−
decay. Note that in Eq. (5.4) we neglected the eﬀect of the inelastic (Gribov) nuclear
shadowing — at the large values of W that we consider, due to an eventual decrease of
the dispersion of hadronic ﬂuctuations of a projectile with an increase of energy [65], the
relative importance of inelastic nuclear shadowing in our case is much smaller than that in
the case of coherent ρ and φ photoproduction in AA UPCs [24, 66].

For the suppression factor of PV A(W, b) in Eq. (5.1), we use the standard Glauber
model expression for the probability to not have the strong inelastic resolved photon (ρ
meson)–nucleus interaction at the impact parameter b (compare to Eq. (3.5)):

PV A(W, b) = e−σρN (W )TA(b) .

(5.5)

Figure 13 shows the resulting values of R(res.) for the proton (left panel) and Pb (right
panel) as a function of the invariant photon–nucleon energy W . One can see from the ﬁgure
that for the proton, R(res.) ≈ 0.4, which is in agreement with the original result of [50].

Figure 13. The factor of R(res.), Eq. (5.1), quantifying the eﬀect of factorization breaking (sup-
pression) for the resolved photon contribution.

For Pb, the values of R(res.) are an order of magnitude smaller, R(res.) ≈ 0.04, which
reﬂects the very small probability of rapidity gap events with nuclear targets.

While our second scenario involving R(res.) captures the bulk of physics of diﬀractive
factorization breaking coming from the hadron structure of the photon, it neglects such
subtle points as the possible dependence of R(res.) on the parton ﬂavor and xγ due to
the separation of the resolved contribution into the point-like and hadronic terms, the
hadronization corrections and bin migration eﬀects, see the discussion in Ref. [60]. Our
aim here is to examine whether studies of diﬀractive dijet photoproduction in UPCs can
help to distinguish between the two scenarios and, thus, to complement and extend the
analysis of this process at HERA.

Note that for the ﬁrst time, the issue of nuclear dependence of factorization breaking
in diﬀractive dijet production in hard and ultraperipheral pA scattering was considered
in [67]. It was found that soft inelastic proton–nucleus interactions signiﬁcantly suppress
the rapidity gap probability in hard pA scattering, which is in line with the small values
of R(glob.) and R(res.) for the nucleus target, which we use in our analysis.

The resulting cross sections of diﬀractive dijet photoproduction in pp, pA and AA UPC
are presented in Fig. 14–19. The red solid lines correspond to the global suppression factor
of R(glob.) = 0.5 for the proton target and R(glob.) = 0.1 for the nucleus target (note
that in the case of pA UPCs, we encounter a mixed situation); the blue dot-dashed lines
correspond to the suppression of the resolved photon contribution only: R(res.) = 0.4 for
the diﬀracting proton (pp and the photon-from-nucleus contribution to pA) and R(res.) =
0.04 for the diﬀracting nucleus (the photon-from-proton contribution to pA and AA). For
comparison, we also show our results that do not include the eﬀect of diﬀractive QCD
factorization breaking by black dotted lines labeled “R = 1”. Note that in all cases, we
show only the predictions corresponding to the central value of the renormalization and
factorization scale µ = Ejet1

suppression is xjets
as expected, where resolved-only suppression is smaller in the highest
and larger in the lower bins. As also observed previously in diﬀractive dijet photopro-
duction at HERA [31], the distributions in Ejet1
also show diﬀerences, i.e. resolved-only
suppression results in harder spectra than global suppression. These diﬀerences are more
pronounced in pA collisions compared to pp collisions due to the enhanced photon ﬂux
and asymmetric experimental setup. In pA UPCs, also the zjets
IP distributions diﬀer, i.e.
resolved-only suppression is less eﬀective at small values of that variable, which are cor-
related with large xjets
. Naturally, similar diﬀerences are then observed in the average
rapidity and rapidity diﬀerence distributions, from which the observed momentum fraction
variables are derived.
In pA UPCs, the diﬀerences of the two suppression schemes are
furthermore enhanced at higher center-of-mass energy, where the low zjets
region is par-
IP
ticularly enhanced. In contrast, in AA collisions the shape of the zIP distribution is quite
diﬀerent from those in pp and pA collisions, but is similar in the two used suppression
schemes, which makes it less sensitive to the factorization breaking pattern.

LHC. Using general kinematic conditions and cuts on the ﬁnal state, we found that the

– 33 –

values of the cross section as a function of various variables are suﬃciently large, i.e., this
process can be observed. Compared to studies of this process in ep scattering at HERA, we
observe that UPCs provide an enhanced sensitivity to the low-zjets
IP region probing the quark
and gluon diﬀractive parton distributions in the proton and nuclei at small momentum
fractions z and an access to much larger values of W .

In our calculations, we used nuclear diﬀractive PDFs, which are strongly suppressed
by nuclear shadowing; neglecting this eﬀect, our predictions for AA UPCs and for the
photon–nucleus contribution to pA UPCs would be larger by the factor of seven.

UPCs also give a new handle on the issue of diﬀractive QCD factorization breaking
through its A dependence: while the two competing schemes of factorization breaking based
on the global and resolved-only suppression factors give rather similar predictions for pp
UPCs (like in the case of ep scattering at HERA), the two scenarios give rather diﬀerent
predictions for AA UPCs and to some extent for pA UPCs. The best observable to look for
this eﬀect is the xjets
, which is dominated by the direct photon
contribution and where the ordering between the cross sections calculated using R(glob.)
and R(res.) changes. This is illustrated in Fig. 20 summarizing our results for the xjets
dependence in Run 1 (upper panel) and Run 2 (lower panel). Note that in this ﬁgure, the
two schemes of factorization breaking for the pp case are indistinguishable.

The results presented in this work are based on the NLO collinear factorization for-
malism of pQCD. In the framework of high-energy QCD, diﬀractive dijet production in
photon–proton and photon–nucleus collisions was considered in the Color Glass Conden-
sate (CGC) formalism at leading order in Ref. [68]. It was found that the eﬀects of gluon
saturation can be searched for in the dijet azimuthal angle correlations and t distribu-
tions. In addition, a theoretical framework for diﬀractive production of jets in the QCD
shock-wave approach has started to be developed in a series of papers [69, 70]. It will be
interesting to confront these diﬀerent approaches with LHC data in the future.

A Suppression factors used for calculations in this paper

For convenience of the reader, we give in this Appendix simple parametrizations of the
various suppression factors used in our calculations in this paper.

1. The rapidity gap survival probability factor of S2(x) for pp UPCs, which is given by
Eq. (2.12) and shown in Fig. 3, can be ﬁtted to better than 5% accuracy by the following
simple form:

S2(x) =

0.85

1 + ax + bx2 ,

(A.1)

where a = 14 and b = 1.4 at √sN N = 7 TeV; a = 15 and b = 4.8 at √sN N = 13 TeV.

2. To quantify the suppression of the photon ﬂux of the proton in pA UPCs due to the
(x) (see Eqs. (3.4) and

strong interaction, it is convenient to introduce the factor of f sup
(3.5)):

p

f sup

(x) ≡ R d2b ΓpA(b)fγ/p(x, b)

fγ/p(x)

The last equality gives a simple ﬁt, which reproduces the calculation of f sup
to better than
5% accuracy. Note that f sup
(x) gives the ratio of the red solid and the blue dot-dashed
curves in the right panel of Fig. 6. The ﬁt of Eq. (A.2) is valid both at √sN N = 5.02 TeV
and √sN N = 8.16 TeV, since f sup
(x) does not change in this energy interval to better than
p
a fraction of a percent accuracy.
