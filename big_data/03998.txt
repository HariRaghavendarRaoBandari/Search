Abstract

We show that calculation of a scattered fermion polarization (for a pure ini-
tial state) is equivalent to the problem of looking for complete polarization axis of
bispinor. This gives the method for calculation of polarization applicable for both
ﬁnal and intermediate state fermions. We suggest to use fermion propagator (bare
or dressed) in form of spectral representation, which gives the orthogonal oﬀ-shell
energy projectors. This representation leads to covariant separation of particle and
antiparticle contributions and gives a natural deﬁnition for polarization of interme-
diate state fermion.

1 Introduction

A calculation of a scattered fermion polarization is a well-known problem in quantum
ﬁeld theory, see for example [1] . But if we are interested in polarization of intermediate
fermion, ﬁrst of all we should give an exact meaning for this concept.

The ﬁrst part of this paper concerns to technical aspects of calculation of a fermion
polarization. Namely, we discuss the problem of search for a complete polarization axis
(36) for the ﬁnal bispinor. It can be shown that the found axis (4-vector z) coincides with
polarization of ﬁnal fermion s(f ) calculated by the standard way (23), (26) for pure initial
state. Since the proposed method uses an amplitude but not its square, it can be applied
also for intermediate state. In this case one should simply change an energy projector in
a problem to the oﬀ-shell one.

The rest of this paper is devoted to application of proposed method for intermediate
fermion. It is known that the on-mass-shell fermion density matrix consists of two factors:
the energy projector and spin density matrix [2]. In order to deﬁne the fermion polar-
ization in an intermediate state, ﬁrst of all one should introduce some oﬀ-shell energy
projectors. Here may exist diﬀerent variants, but there is no some commonly accepted
deﬁnition. For example, in the known method of quasi-real electrons [3, 4] the energy
poles are accompanied by rather artiﬁcial energy projectors which are not orthogonal to
each other.

To deﬁne fermion polarization in an intermediate state, we suggest to use the covariant
form of propagator Eq. (53), which contains the orthogonal oﬀ-shell projection operators.
This view of free propagator is a particular case of the spectral representation and can
In Ref. [5] the spectral representation of
be generalized with account of interactions.

1

fermion propagator in the theory with P-parity violation was constructed. Corresponding
the energy projection operators (see (58)) diﬀer from the standard oﬀ-shell projectors and
also contain γ5. Moreover, in such theory the standard spin projectors do not commute
with propagator and have to be modiﬁed as well [6]. The use of spectral representation for
dressed propagator gives natural deﬁnition for polarization of fermion in an intermediate
state.

This problem has direct relation to an experiment since polarization of produced par-
ticle carries information about production mechanism. Hence, for example, the polariza-
tion of t-quark produced in hadron collisions is very interesting from experimental point
of view [7–10].

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to discussion of the problem
of looking for complete polarization axis for non-relativistic electron and its connection
with calculation of a ﬁnal electron polarization as such. The equivalence of these two
problems is shown that allows to compute ﬁnal electron polarization using the amplitude
but not its square. More speciﬁcally, it is reduced to solving of complete polarization axis
problem.

In section 3 the similar problem is discussed for bispinor. The equivalence of these two
problems is shown for relativistic electron that in fact is consequence of similar property
for two-dimensional spinors. As an example the scattering of electron in external ﬁeld is
considered.

In section 4 the eigenvalue problem for inverse propagator and corresponding spectral
representation are discussed. This representation leads to covariant separation of positive
and negative energy poles which are accompanied by the oﬀ-shell energy projectors or-
thogonal to each other. The presence of γ5 in vertex leads to modiﬁcation (dressing) of
both standard energy and spin projectors.

Section 5 is devoted to application of the section 3 method for fermion in an interme-
diate state. If to use the spectral representation for propagator, the problem of search of
a complete polarization axis allows to ﬁnd polarization vectors for particle and antipar-
ticle contributions. Let us note that the pure spin density matrices correspond to these
contributions.

In Conclusions we brieﬂy discuss the obtained results. Some technical details are

grouped in Appendix.

2 Scattering of non-relativistic electron

2.1 Polarization of scattered electron

Assume that electron from initial state characterized by twice the mean spin vector ζ
is turned into ﬁnal state characterized by vector ζ ′ (polarization selected by a detector),
then transition amplitude is

ff i = w†(ζ ′) ˆf w(ζ).

Here w(ζ) is eigenstate of operator σζ:

(σζ) w(ζ) = w(ζ)

(1)

(2)

and similarly w(ζ ′) is eigenstate of operator σζ ′. The operator ˆf in the general case is
equal to ˆf = A+σB, where A and B are complex parameters. For the sake of deﬁniteness

2

we choose B = Bν where ν is unit real vector such that

ˆf = A + B (σν),

ν2 = 1.

(3)

It is easy to calculate the ζ(f ), i.e. the polarization of ﬁnal state as such (see §140

in [11]):

ζ(f ) =

(|A|2 − |B|2) ζ + 2|B|2 ν(νζ) + 2 Im(AB∗) ν × ζ + 2 Re(AB∗) ν

|A|2 + |B|2 + 2 Re(AB∗)(νζ)

.

(4)

Note that Eqs. (1) and (2) are written for pure quantum states for which |ζ| = |ζ ′| = 1.
But the result (4) has exactly the same form for both pure and mixed initial states, when
|ζ| 6 1.

In order to calculate a ﬁnal electron polarization as such one needs to calculate the
transition probability which is proportional to square of matrix element (1). In that case
the spin density matrices can correspond to pure or mixed states

The matrix element square (5) represents in fact the projection of spin density matrix
of scattered electron (which is characterized by some vector ζ(f )) onto the detector spin
density matrix (1 + σζ ′)/2. Thus, comparing (5) with

2.2 The complete polarization axis of spinor

Let us consider an arbitrary two-dimensional spinor

b(cid:19) ,
χ =(cid:18)a

|a|2 + |b|2 = 1.

(11)

It is known (see §59 in [11]) that for any spinor χ there exists an axis of complete polar-
ization, i.e. there exists such unit vector ζ that

(σζ)χ = χ.

In scattering process described by the amplitude (1) a new state appears

w(ζ) → ˆf w(ζ) = ˆf (1 + σζ) χ,

(12)

(13)

where χ is an arbitrary spinor. Let us consider the problem of search for complete polar-
ization axis z for spinor ˆf w(ζ):

and it is known that the problem has a solution.

(cid:0)σz(cid:1) ˆf (1 + σζ) χ = ˆf (1 + σζ) χ,

It is convenient to rewrite this equation in an equivalent form

1 + σz

2

· ˆf

1 + σζ

χ = ˆf

χ.

(14)

(15)

Recall that amplitude contains a spinor with deﬁnite polarization, so in Eq.

(15)
vector ζ is unit one (in contrast to (5)). However, if to use a pure spin density matrix
of initial state (ζ2 = 1) within the spur in (5), then both problems, (5) and (15), are
equivalent and two vectors coincide: ζ(f ) = z. Let us show this equivalence.

Suppose that we have solved the problem (15), i.e.

the vector z is known. Take

Hermitian adjoint of the previous equation:

χ† 1 + σζ

2

ˆf † ·

1 + σz

2

= χ† 1 + σζ

ˆf †.

Multiplying Eqs. (15), (16) by each other one obtains the following matrix relation1

ˆf † ≡ X.

·(cid:16) ˆf

ˆf †(cid:17) ·

Here the known matrix X (10) has been appeared and previous equation demonstrates
its evident property:

X · (1 − σz) = (1 − σz) · X = 0.

(18)

If to recall the matrix X decomposition (10), we get two equations for vector of ﬁnal
polarization ζ(f ) at the given z

(1 + σζ(f )) · (1 − σz) = (1 − σz)(1 + σζ(f )) = 0.

(19)

1The matrix (1 + σζ)χχ†(1 + σζ) arisen after multiplication coincides up to a factor with (1 + σζ).

We come to (17) after factor cancellation (recall that χ is an arbitrary spinor).

4

Writing down two relations (19) in details:

(1 + σζ(f )) · (1 − σz) = 1 − ζ(f )z + σ(ζ(f ) − z) + i σ(ζ(f ) × z) = 0,
(1 − σz) · (1 + σζ(f )) = 1 − ζ(f )z + σ(ζ(f ) − z) − i σ(ζ(f ) × z) = 0,

(20)

it is easy to see that the only solution is ζ(f ) = z.

On the other hand, if we know vector ζ(f ) then from (19) it follows that z = ζ(f ).
Thus we see that for scattering of non-relativistic electron these two problems: the cal-
culation of ﬁnal electron polarization vector (5) (for pure state) and looking for complete
polarization axis (15) are equivalent. So the ﬁnal electron polarization can be calculated
from scattering amplitude instead of its square.

3 Scattering of relativistic electron

The scheme outlined above can be applied also for scattering of relativistic electrons.
Assume that electron from initial state characterized by momentum p1µ and polarization
vector s1µ is turned into ﬁnal state characterized by vectors p2µ and s2µ (polarization
selected by a detector), then transition amplitude is

M = ¯u2(p2, s2)Γu1(p1, s1).

Here u(p, s) is solution of Dirac equation

(ˆp − m)u(p, s) = 0,

(21)

(22)

and matrix Γ characterizes the transition process.

In order to ﬁnd the ﬁnal electron polarization it is necessary to calculate the transition

probability which is proportional to square of matrix element (21)

dent on it. Since (s2p2) = 0, only transverse part of vector Bµ remains in (23)

show that all coeﬃcients are easily expressed by means of p2, A, Bµ except of projection
on σµν. The decomposition has view

However, the coeﬃcient xµν is related with parameters A, Bµ too. To see it, let us note
that X has the following properties

(1 − ˆn2)X = X(1 − ˆn2) = 0

and the most general form of such matrix (see Appendix A) is

result the matrix X (29) looks like

3.1 The search for complete polarization axis of bispinor

After scattering described by the amplitude (21) we have a new state

u(p1, s1) → Λ+

2 Γu(p1, s1) = Λ+

(39)

Note that here the known matrix X (29), (34) has been appeared. This relation can be
transformed into equation connecting the complete polarization axis zµ and ﬁnal electron
polarization s(f )
µ .

As it follows from previous relation the matrix X satisﬁes equations

(1 − γ5ˆz) · X = X · (1 − γ5ˆz) = 0.

(40)

If to use for X the expression (34) found above we obtain the following two equations

(1 + ˆn2)(1 − γ5ˆz)(1 + γ5ˆs(f )) = (1 + ˆn2)(1 + γ5ˆs(f ))(1 − γ5 ˆz) = 0.

(41)

Both expressions are under observation of singular matrix (1 + ˆn2) but in the relation
linking zµ and s(f )

it does not play any role. Let us multiply spin matrices

µ

(1 − γ5ˆz)(1 + γ5ˆs(f )) = 1 + (zs(f )) + γ5ˆs(f ) − γ5 ˆz + σµνzµs(f )
(1 + γ5ˆs(f ))(1 − γ5 ˆz) = 1 + (zs(f )) + γ5ˆs(f ) − γ5 ˆz − σµνzµs(f )

ν = 0,
ν = 0.

(42)

It immediately follows that these two vectors coincide s(f ) = z.

So for relativistic electron there is also the equivalence of these two problems: the
calculation of scattered fermion polarization (23), (26) (for pure initial state) and looking
for the bispinor complete polarization axis (37). The distinction of the problem of looking
for complete polarization axis is the use of amplitude instead of its square. This makes
possible to apply the same method for calculation of fermion polarization both for ﬁnal
and intermediate states.

By way of simple example let us consider single scattering of electron in an external
ﬁeld. We will check the found above equivalence of two problems and discuss some
features.

lence s(f ) = z and expression (26) for s(f ) tell that vector z does not depend on bispinor
χ. It means that (43) can be rewritten as a matrix problem

(44)

The matrix formulation of the problem gives rather convenient method to ﬁnd vector z:
one should decompose (44) in γ-matrix basis and seek for vector zµ as an expansion over
available vectors3. We checked that for external ﬁelds of diﬀerent kinds (S, P , V , A) the
solution of the problem (44) coincides with ﬁnal fermion polarization calculated according
to (26) (for deﬁnite polarization of initial fermion, s2

1 = −1).

We will present here solutions of the problem (44) for scalar and vector vertices

• Γ = 1

• Γ = γµAµ(q)

zµ = s1µ − a1p1µ − a2p2µ,

a1 = a2 =

3For S and P vertices these are vectors n1µ, n2µ, s1µ and expansion looks as

(46)

zµ = z1n1µ + z2n2µ + z3s1µ + z4εµνλσnν

for V and A vertices there exists also vector Aµ and expansion is:

zµ = z1n1µ + z2n2µ + z3s1µ + z4Aµ.

8

It is signiﬁcant here that expressions (45), (46) for polarization of ﬁnal electron ob-
tained for pure initial state holds for mixed state too. Indeed, let electron initial state is
described by mixed density matrix

(1 + γ5ˆs1) = α1

2

(1 + γ5ˆs) + α2

2

(1 − γ5ˆs), α1 + α2 = 1,

(47)

where αi are probabilities and sµ is polarization axis, s2 = −1. As a result the density
matrix of mixed state is arisen characterized by polarization vector sµ
1 = (α1 − α2)sµ,
|s2

1| < 1.

Now we can solve two diﬀerent problems (37) involving spin projectors Σ0(s) and
Σ0(−s). Let 4-vectors z1, z2, (z2
i = −1) are complete polarization axes for these two
problems (on the other hand, they are polarizations of ﬁnal electron (26) in these two
cases).
It is clear that for mixed state polarization of ﬁnal electron is determined by
linear combination α1z1 + α2z2. Looking for example at Eqs. (45), (46), one can see that
they are valid for partial polarization also. This fact is based only on linearity of ﬁnal
fermion polarization s(f )

µ over vector s1 and takes place for any vertex.

Note that for electron scattering in external ﬁeld the initial pure spin state leads to
deﬁnite polarization of ﬁnal state. It is not evident in advance, quite the contrary, it would
be natural to expect the appearance of a mixed ﬁnal state in this case. Calculations of
amplitude square demonstrates this fact, but the reason is the equivalence of these two
problems s(f ) = z discussed here. Below it will be seen that fermion in an intermediate
state also has similar property.

4 Spectral representation of propagator

We want to apply the problem of looking for complete polarization axis (37) to the
case of fermion in an intermediate state. All aforesaid is easily extended for the case of
virtual fermions if to use a spectral representation of propagator.

In order to construct this representation one needs to solve eigenvalue problem for
inverse propagator S(p) = G−1(p). Since there is convenient γ-matrix basis, one can solve
a matrix problem: to look for eigenprojectors Π and eigenvalues λ

SΠ = λΠ.

(48)

Having solved this problem, i.e. having found eigenvalues λi and orthogonal system of
eigenprojectors Πi

we can construct the spectral representation of inverse propagator

ΠiΠk = δikΠi,

i, k = 1, 2,

S(p) = λ1Π1 + λ2Π2.

(49)

(50)

If the system of projectors is complete, then this expression can be easily reversed and
propagator looks like this:

G(p) =

1
λ1

Π1 +

Π2,

(51)

λ2

i.e. propagator poles are zeroes of eigenvalues λi. Let us consider how the propagator
spectral representation is shown up in particular cases.

(53)

is shown up as a sum of poles with positive and negative energies. It is necessary to stress
that we have covariant separation of poles 1/(W ± m0) because W is invariant mass.
Besides that, since fermion and anti-fermion have opposite parities the representation
(53) sorts out contributions by parity4.

With account of interaction the inverse propagator takes the form

S(p) = ˆp − m0 − Σ(p),

(54)

where Σ(p) is self-energy contribution. For dressed propagator the spectral representation
looks diﬀerently on form of interaction.

Σ(p) = A(p2) + ˆpB(p2) + γ5C(p2) + ˆpγ5D(p2),

(57)

and eigenprojectors Πi(W ) do not coincide with Λ±
take a more complicated form [5]:

W . In this case the eigenprojectors

τ =

1

R(cid:16)1 − B − γ5D − ˆnγ5 C

and eigenvalues λi(W ) are

Π1,2(W ) =

1

ˆp
W

,

ˆn =

2(cid:0)1 ± ˆnτ(cid:1),
W(cid:17), R =p(1 − B)2 − D2 + C 2/W 2,

λ1,2(W ) = −m0 − A(W 2) ± W R(W 2).

(58)

(59)

4In contrast to equivalent electrons method [3, 4] (see also the usage of this method in particular
calculations [12–14]) the representation (53) is based on the orthogonal projectors and has covariant
form. Besides that it is easily generalized for the case of dressed propagator.

10

An essential aspect related with the completeness of eigenprojectors system is the
existence of spin projectors commuting with propagator. The existence of such projectors
follows simply from counting of degrees of freedom in a problem. However, the standard
spin projectors

Σ0(s) =

1 + γ5ˆs

2

,

s2 = −1,

(sp) = 0,

(60)

cease to commute with propagator in the presence of γ5 in a vertex.

Nevertheless, there exist the generalized (dressed) spin projectors [6] closely related

with eigenprojectors (58) and having all desired properties

Σ(s) =

1

2(cid:0)1 + γ5ˆsτ(cid:1).

Note that Πi and Σ(s) have the same matrix factor τ (58) which possesses the following
property. Without interaction (B = C = D = 0) or in theory with parity conservation
(C = D = 0) this factor turns into unit matrix τ = 1. As a consequence the projectors
Πi and Σ(s) return to the standard (bare) form.

Furthermore, it can be seen that “under the observation” of energy eigenprojector Πi

the spin projector (61) is signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed

(61)

(62)

ΠiΣ(s) = Πi

2(cid:0)1 + γ5ˆsˆn(cid:1).

The problem of looking for bispinor complete polarization axis (37) is naturally gen-

eralized for the case of virtual fermion.

Using free propagator (52) one needs only to change projector Λ+

2 in (37) to one of oﬀ-
2 = W 2. The problem of looking for complete

shell projectors Λ±
polarization axis (37) is turned into that:

W (p2) = (1 ± ˆp2/W )/2, p2

1
2

(1 + γ5ˆz±) · Λ±

W (p2)ΓΛ+

1 Σ1u1 = Λ±

W (p2)ΓΛ+

1 Σ1u1,

(z±p2) = 0,

(63)

and (as it is shown in Appendix B) such problem also has solution: for any bispinor u1
there exists a vector z±

µ , (z±)2 = −1.

The aforesaid is referred equally to dressed propagator in theory with γ5 as well. Let
us write down the problem of looking for complete polarization axis for dressed energy
and spin projectors (58), (61):

Σ(z±) · Π±(p2)ΓΛ+

1 Σ1u1 = Π±(p2)ΓΛ+

1 Σ1u1,

(z±p2) = 0.

(64)

The dressed energy projectors (58) in the case of CP conservation can be rewritten in
form (see details in Appendix C)

1

Π± =

2(cid:0)1 ± ˆnτ(cid:1) =

1

2(cid:0)1 ± ˆn e2κγ 5(cid:1) = e−κγ 5 1

2(cid:0)1 ± ˆn(cid:1) eκγ 5

The dressed spin projector can be presented by the same way

.

(65)

Σ(z) =

1

2(cid:0)1 + γ5ˆzτ(cid:1) = e−κγ 5 1

2(cid:0)1 + γ5ˆz(cid:1) eκγ 5

.

(66)

11

After that the looking for axis problem (64) takes form:

1

2(cid:0)1 + γ5ˆz±(cid:1) ·(cid:16)Λ±

W (p2) eκγ 5

ΓΛ+

1 Σ1u1(cid:17) =(cid:16)Λ±

W (p2) eκγ 5

ΓΛ+

(z±p2) = 0.

(67)

1 Σ1u1(cid:17),

As we know, for resolvability of the problem of looking for complete polarization axis of
bispinor it is necessary that bispinor obeys Dirac equation. In other words, for resolvability
only energy projector Λ±
W (p2) in (67) is important. Everything on right side of this
projector aﬀects on the view of vector z± but not on the fact of the resolvability.

5 Polarization of fermion in an intermediate state

The spectral representation of propagator in which orthogonal oﬀ-shell projectors are
arisen allows to give a clear deﬁnition of fermion polarization in an intermediate state.
After that the generalization of the axis looking-for problem (37) (replacing projectors on
oﬀ-shell ones) yields the recipe of polarization calculation in an intermediate state.

Consider the diagram in which intermediate fermion is born in s-channel. Here the
external boson lines correspond either to some on-mass-shell particles or to external ﬁeld.

p1, s1

G(p)

p2, s2

Γ1

p

Γ2

The amplitude looks like:

M = ¯u2(p2, s2)Γ1G(p)Γ2u1(p1, s1).

(68)

For the case of bare propagator or theory without γ5 the fermion propagator in the

intermediate state has form

G(p) =

1
λ1

Λ+

W +

1
λ2

Λ−
W ,

(69)

where Λ±

W are oﬀ-shell energy projectors (52).

If to recall about the problem of looking for complete polarization axis involving Λ±
W

(63), the propagator in the amplitude (68) can be rewritten as following

G =

1
λ1

Λ+

W Σ0(z+) +

1
λ2

Λ−

W Σ0(z−).

(70)

This gives a natural deﬁnition for polarization of fermion in an intermediate state.
Polarization vectors z± are diﬀerent for poles with positive and negative energies. It is

not so evident that spin density matrices in (70) are pure ones: (cid:0)z±(cid:1)2 = −1, however,

this is a result of the axis looking for problem (63).

It is possible to calculate polarization vector either with the help of the axis looking

for problem (63) or by analogy with (23) with the use of spur:

Sp(cid:0)Λ±

W Σ0(z±)Γu1¯u1˜Γ(cid:1) = A(cid:16)1 +

12

Bµ
A

z±µ(cid:17),

z±
µ = −

B⊥
µ
A

.

(71)

It seems that the second way is technically simpler. As indicated above the formula for
polarization z± calculated for pure state holds for mixed initial state also.

Let us take a look now on the case of the theory with γ5 in vertex. In this case dressed

fermion propagator in intermediate state may be represented as

G(p) =

1
λ1

Π1(p) +

1
λ2

Π2(p),

(72)

where Π1,2(p) are energy projectors (58). Since the dressed energy and spin projectors
(58), (61) can be turned into the standard ones by transformation of γ-matrices (γµ →
γ′µ), all is repeated in analogy with (70), so the dressed propagator inside of diagram
acquires spin projectors

G → ˜G =

1
λ1

Π1(p)Σ(z+) +

1
λ2

Π2(p)Σ(z−),

(z±)2 = −1,

(73)

that are determined by initial state, see the problem (64). It should be pointed out that
dressed energy projectors Πi(p) presented here contain self-energy contributions and have
to be renormalized.

6 Conclusions

The main statement of the work is that the ﬁnal fermion polarization as such (26) can
be calculated by a non-standard way, namely by using the problem of search for complete
polarization axis of bispinor (36). We have shown that these two problems are equivalent.
It is unlikely that the problem (36) leads to more simple calculations, rather oppo-
site, the calculation of spurs in the standard approach is a routine operation which is
successfully performed by a computer. However, in the axis looking for problem (36) the
amplitude is appeared rather than its square. This allows to use this problem to ﬁnd
polarization of fermion in an intermediate state.

The important technical moment is the use of propagator spectral representation (53),
(56), (58). This gives the system of orthogonal oﬀ-shell projectors and allows to give clear
deﬁnition for fermion polarization in an intermediate state. Thus it is possible to use
either free propagator or dressed one, including the theory with γ5 in vertex.

When a propagator is written in form of the spectral representation it is possible to
use the axis looking-for problem for calculation of the oﬀ-mass-shell polarization. In fact
in the problem (36) of ﬁnal electron polarization (on mass shell) the energy projector is
changed to the oﬀ-shell one. As a result the propagator inside of a diagram takes view
(73) where spin density matrices correspond to complete polarization.

The fact that, for example, the projector Π1 of positive energy state in (73) is accom-
panied by completely polarized spin density matrix Σ(z+), (z+)2 = −1 is not evident in
advance and is the result of the axis looking-for problem.

We are grateful to V.G. Serbo for fruitful discussions and participation in the beginning

of the work.

A Auxiliary matrix problem

Let us ﬁnd out how looks like a matrix X of 4 dimensions obeying equations

X(1 − ˆn) = (1 − ˆn)X = 0, nµ = pµ/m, n2 = 1.

For this purpose we decompose the matrix X by γ-matrix basis

X = x0 + xµγµ + ¯x0γ5 + ¯xµγ5γµ + xµνσµν,

(74)

(75)

and determine the coeﬃcients of this decomposition. We give the most simple action
steps leading to the answer.

Computing coeﬃcients at γ5 in relations (74) one obtain pair of equations

¯x0 + (n¯x) = 0,

¯x0 − (n¯x) = 0,

from which it immediately follows that ¯x0 = 0 and (n¯x) = 0.

Next, determining coeﬃcients at γ5γµ in these relations we come to equations

xµ − x0nµ + 2xµνnν = 0,

xµ − x0nµ − 2xµνnν = 0.

Hence it follows that xµ = x0nµ.

Finally, calculating coeﬃcients at σµν in any of relations (74) we determine xµν:

xµν = −

i
2

εµναβnα ¯xβ.

(76)

(77)

(78)

Taking into account the found ¯x0, xµ, ¯xµ and xµν one ﬁnds that the rest decomposition
coeﬃcients of relations (74) are equal to zero. Thus we obtain that matrix X has view

X = x0(1 + ˆn) + ¯xµγ5γµ −

i
2

εµναβnα ¯xβσµν,

(79)

with arbitrary parameter x0 and vector ¯xµ: (n¯x) = 0. Let us rewrite this expression for
more illustrative of the result in form resembling density matrix that is a particular case

X = x0(1 + ˆn) + ¯xµγ5γµ(1 + ˆn) = (1 + ˆn)(x0 + ¯xµγ5γµ),

(n¯x) = 0.

B Complete polarization axis of bispinor

It is known that any spinor has complete polarization axis. Bispinor have similar
property. If Ψ(p) is an arbitrary solution of Dirac equation then there is such vector sµ
that (cp. with (12))

γ5ˆs · Ψ(p) = Ψ(p),

s2 = −1,

(sp) = 0,

p2 = m2.

(81)

Let us show this on example of solution of Dirac equation with positive energy u(p, s).

Write down equation (81) in split form

γ5ˆs(cid:18)u1

u2(cid:19) =(cid:18)u1
u2(cid:19) .

(82)

In the standard representation of the matrices γ we have

γ5ˆs =(cid:18)σ · s −s0

s0 −σ · s(cid:19) ,

n · σϕ (cid:19) ,
u =(cid:18)(n0 + 1)ϕ

where nµ = pµ/m, n2 = 1, n0 > 0 and ϕ is an arbitrary two-component spinor. Sub-
stituting these formulas into (82) we come to the problem of determination of complete
polarization axis for two-dimensional spinor

It is easy to check that vector appeared here

σ ·(cid:18)s −

s0n

n0 + 1(cid:19) ϕ = ϕ.

S = s −

s0n

n0 + 1

(83)

(84)

has unit length S2 = 1 if to recall that s2 = −1, (ns) = 0 and n2 = 1.

As we see for solutions of Dirac equation with positive energy the relation (81) can be
reduced to equation (83) which has solution for any two-dimensional column (cp. with
(12)).

In a similar manner one can check that relation (81) holds for solutions with negative

energy too.

Bispinors of oﬀ-shell states are deﬁned as solutions of equations Λ−

W Ψ(p) = 0 and
W Ψ(p) = 0 at p2 = W 2 (positive and negative frequency solutions). It is an easy matter

Λ+
to check that there is complete polarization axis sµ for such states, in other words

γ5ˆsΨ(p) = Ψ(p),

s2 = −1,

(ps) = 0,

p2 = W 2.

(85)

The proof repeats exactly the similar consideration for Dirac equation solution.

C Projectors dressing and change to another γ-matrices

representation

Let us show that dressed energy projector (58) can be transformed into the standard
one (52) by changing to another representation of γ-matrices. At ﬁrst, let us consider the
case of CP conservation (C = 0 in (58)) and show that in such case

Πi =

1

2(cid:0)1 + ˆnτ(cid:1) =

1

2 1 + ˆn

with some transformed matrices γ′µ.

(1 − B) − Dγ5

p(1 − B)2 − D2! =

1

2(cid:0)1 + nµγ′µ(cid:1).

(86)

Firstly, note that matrix τ can be written in exponential view

(1 − B) − Dγ5

p(1 − B)2 − D2

Next, performing transformation of form

τ =

= cosh 2κ + γ5 sinh 2κ = e2κγ 5

.

(87)

ˆnτ = ˆn e2κγ 5

= ˆn eκγ 5

· eκγ 5

= e−κγ 5

ˆn eκγ 5

= nµγ′
µ,

we see that γ-matrices in another representation are appeared

µ = T −1γµT,
γ′

T = eκγ 5

,

γ′5 = γ5.

(88)

In the general case when CP is not conserved the τ can contain matrix ˆnγ5 as well. In
that case in order to reduce projector into standard view a one more transformation of
γ-matrices is required

γµ → γ′

µ → γ′′
µ,

µ = e−β ˆn′γ ′5
γ′′

µ eβ ˆn′γ ′5
γ′

.

(89)

Finally, let us note that transformations (88), (89) are not unitary.
