DERIVED NONCOMMUTATIVE ZARISKI IMMERSION AND

AN EQUIVALENT REFORMULATION OF

FRIEDLANDER-MILNOR CONJECTURE

ILIAS AMRANI

Abstract. We introduce the notion of derived formal noncommutative Zariski
immersion for diﬀerential graded algebra with examples from topology. We il-
lustrate the importance of such notion by reformulating the Friedlander-Milnor
conjecture in terms of formal noncommutative Zariski immersions. This paper
is based on the language developed by Dwyer, Greenless and Iyendar.

1. Noncommutative Zariski immersion

The notion of derived formal Zariski immersion shows up in the context of E∞-
ring spectrum [9] seeking for a formulation of the Zariski topology in the setting
of derived algebraic geometry. Our goal is to extend the deﬁnition in the noncom-
mutative world and show that many interesting constructions in topology can be
formulated using this notion.

Deﬁnition 1.1. Let i : A → B be a map of A∞-diﬀerential graded algebras. The
map i is a derived formal Zariski immersion if the induced map of chain complexes
B ⊗L

A B → B is a quasi-isomorphism.

It is not hard to see that our deﬁnition 1.1 is equivalent to the one given in
[9, Deﬁnition 2.1.1] in the commutative setting. The deﬁnition is inspired form
algebraic geometry cf [9, Lemma 2.1.4]. If spec(T ) → spec(R) is a Zariski open
immersion between aﬃne schemes then R → T is a derived formal Zariski immer-
sion. The derived formal Zariski immersion are closely related to the smashing
localization. For more details we refer to [9].

Lemma 1.2. Let i : A → B be a a derived formal Zariski immersion then derived
right adjoint functor between the triangulated categories

Ri∗ : Ho(B − Mod) → Ho(A − Mod)

is fully faithful.

Proof. Since B ⊗L
A B → B is a quasi-isomorphism and B is a compact generator
A Ri∗X ∼= X for any object X ∈ Ho(B − Mod).
for Ho(B − Mod) we have that B ⊗L
Moreover, Ho(B − Mod) is a smashing localization of Ho(A − Mod) with respect to
the left derived adjoint B ⊗L
(cid:3)

A −.

Remark 1.3. In the case when Ri∗ : Ho(B − Mod) → Ho(A − Mod) is fully faithful,
the counit map B ⊗L
A Ri∗B → B is a quasi-isomorphism. Hence our
deﬁnition 1.1 is equivalent to the deﬁnition [9, Deﬁnition 2.1.1] in the commutative
case.

A B ∼= B ⊗L

2. Friedlander-Milnor Conjecture

Let G be a connected Lie group and let Gδ be the underlying discrete group,

Milnor has conjectured [6] that the natural group homomorphism

i : Gδ → G

induces an isomorphism in cohomology of classifying space with coeﬃcients in the
ﬁnite ﬁeld Fp

i∗ : H ∗(BG; Fp) → H ∗(BGδ; Fp).

The conjecture is known to be true for solvable Lie groups in particular for R and
the n-torus T = S1 × · · · × S1 [6]. Notice that the map i∗ is always injective. For
more details we refer the reader to [5, Chapter 5].

Theorem 2.1. The Friedlander-Milnor conjecture (for connected Lie group) is true
if and only if the natural map of diﬀerential graded algebras Fp[Gδ] → C∗(G; Fp)
is a derived formal Zariski immersion in the sense of 1.1.

3

Proof. Suppose that i : Fp[Gδ] → C∗(G; Fp) is a derived formal Zariski immersion,
it induces a fully faithful functor

Ri∗ : Ho(C∗(G; Fp) − Mod) → Ho(Fp[Gδ] − Mod)

in particular

RHomC∗(G;Fp)(Fp, Fp) ≃ RHomFp[Gδ](Fp, Fp).

On another hand by [2, Section 4.22] (or [8] where the E2-term of a converging
spectral sequence is constructed), we have that

and

H∗RHomC∗(G;Fp)(Fp, Fp) ≃ H ∗(BG; Fp),

H∗RHomFp[Gδ](Fp, Fp) ≃ H ∗(BGδ; Fp).

Now, we suppose that the Friedlander-Milnor conjecture is true and we consider
the following ﬁbre sequence (of G-principle bundle) of topological spaces

G → G ×Gδ EGδ → BGδ.

In particular it induces the following ﬁbre sequence

G ×Gδ EGδ → BGδ → BG.

Since we have supposed the Friedlander-Milnor is true, it implies by [5, Lemma
5.1.2] that H∗(G ×Gδ EGδ, Fp) has the homology of a point. Therefore by [7,
Theorem 3.1, Corollaire 2], we have a quasi-isomorphism between chain complexes

C∗(G ×Gδ EGδ; Fp) ≃ C∗(G; Fp) ⊗L

Fp[Gδ] Fp ≃ Fp.

By hypothesis, H∗(G, Fp) has ﬁnite total dimension and H i(BG; Fp) has a ﬁnite
dimension for each i ≥ 0 (G is a connected Lie group). It follows that the augmen-
tation map C∗(G, Fp) → Fp is cosmall, in the sense that the thick subcategory of
Ho(C∗(G; Fp) − Mod) generated by Fp contains C∗(G; Fp) [2, Section 5.6]. There-
fore the equivalence C∗(G; Fp) ⊗L

Fp[Gδ] Fp ≃ Fp implies that

C∗(G; Fp) ⊗L

Fp[Gδ] C∗(G; Fp) ≃ C∗(G; Fp),

since the derived functor C∗(G; Fp) ⊗L
and shifts.

Fp[Gδ]

− commutes with homotopy colimits
(cid:3)

Corollary 2.2. The natural map of E∞-diﬀerential graded algebras Fp[T δ] →
C∗(T, Fp) is a formal derived Zariski immersion for every prime p, where T is
a torus.

Proof. It follows directly from 2.1 and the fact that Friedlander-Milnor conjecture
is true for any torus [6].
(cid:3)

Corollary 2.3. Let G be a connected Lie group, the natural map of A∞-diﬀerential
graded algebras Fp[Gδ] → C∗(G, Fp) is a formal derived Zariski immersion for every
prime p.

Proof. It is a direct consequence of 2.1 and [1, Theorem 3.7].

3. p-Completion

Let X a connected space and X → LpX a ﬁbrant replacement of X in LpTop.
For any connected sapce there exists a discrete group G such that BG → X is an
equivalence in LpTop [4].

Proposition 3.1. Let X be a simply connected and G as before, such that for any
natural number i the dimension of H i(X; Fp) is ﬁnite and the total dimension of
H∗(ΩX; Fp) is ﬁnite. Then the map G ≃ ΩBG → ΩX induces the map Fp[G] →
C∗(ΩX; Fp) of A∞-diﬀerential graded algebras which is a derived formal Zariski
immersion.

Proof. First, we recall that any topological monoid group-like is equivalent to a
honest topological group. By the same arguments as in 2.1, we have that H∗(ΩX ×G
EG; Fp) = 0 for ∗ > 0 i.e. has homology of a point. Using the ﬁniteness conditions
and the same arguments as in 2.1, we conclude that

C∗(ΩX; Fp) ⊗L

Fp[G] C∗(ΩX; Fp) ≃ C∗(ΩX; Fp).
