Abstract

We study one-loop radiative neutrino mass models in which one of the beyond-the-standard

model ﬁelds is either a hypercharge-zero fermion quintet (minimal dark matter) or a hypercharge-

zero scalar septet. By systematically classifying all possible one-loop such models we identify

various processes that render the neutral component of these representations (dark matter) cos-

mologically unstable. Thus, our ﬁndings show that these scenarios are in general not reconcilable

with dark matter stability unless tiny couplings or additional ad hoc symmetries are assumed,

in contrast to minimal dark matter models where stability is entirely due to the standard model
gauge symmetry. For some variants based on higher-order loops we ﬁnd that α2 reaches a Lan-
dau pole at rather low scales, typically comparable to the characteristic scale of the model itself.

Thus, we argue that some of these variations although consistent with dark matter stability and

phenomenological constraints are hard to reconcile with perturbativity criteria.

Introduction

Neutrino physics, dark matter (DM) and the cosmic baryon asymmetry provide strong evidence for
beyond-the-Standard Model (BSM) physics. Neutrino masses and their mixing pattern can be well-
described at the eﬀective level by a certain lepton-number-violating operator [1], with the dim=5 being
the obvious choice. Conventional wisdom is that this operator originates from a type-I seesaw involving
a GUT scale. The reason for this is probably related with the fact that such picture nicely ﬁts within
SO(10)-inspired scenarios, while at the same time explains the absence of charged lepton-ﬂavor-violating
signals in high-intensity experiments [2] 1. In contrast to neutrino physics, there is no such “standard”
scenario for DM, and several phenomenologically-motivated frameworks exist [6]. However, of particular
popularity are WIMP scenarios where the DM relic density results from thermal freeze-out.

Other well-motivated scenarios for neutrino mass generation exist and provide a potential link be-
tween the origin of neutrino masses and that of DM [7] (see e.g. [8] for a phenomenological analysis).
This connection somehow resembles what one ﬁnds in the type-I seesaw, where neutrino masses and
the cosmic baryon asymmetry ﬁnd a common explanation through standard leptogenesis (see [9, 10] for
reviews) 2. Particularly relevant for that endeavor are models where the dim=5 lepton-number-violating
operator arises through radiative corrections (see [13, 14] for a full list of all such possibilities at the
one- and two-loop level). In these contexts several approaches have been adopted to assure DM sta-
bility. The conventional one relies on the introduction of ad hoc symmetries under which the SM and
the dark sector transform diﬀerently, thus guaranteeing stability. These symmetries can have multiple
origins, and can be regarded as remnants of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a more fundamental
symmetry related with e.g. GUTs [15, 16] or ﬂavor theories [17].

Another approach that has been explored relates radiative neutrino masses with higher-order elec-
troweak (EW) representations [18–26]. In this case the idea is diﬀerent and relies on the mechanism
underlying minimal DM models [27–29], namely higher-order EW representations do not allow writ-
ing renormalizable interactions with SM operators and so—at the renormalizable level—are absolutely
stable (at the renormalizable level the minimal DM Lagrangian exhibits an accidental Z2 symmetry).
Decays are induced by eﬀective operators, thus in these scenarios DM is never absolutely stable but can
be cosmologically stable provided the eﬀective operator is suﬃciently suppressed. In [27] it was shown
that the stability condition, the requirement of EW gauge coupling perturbativity up to MPlanck and di-
rect DM searches constraints, singles out two possible representations: hypercharge-zero fermion quintet
and hypercharge-zero scalar septet, of which the fermion quintet deﬁnes the minimal DM model. Re-
cently, in ref. [30] it was shown that for the scalar septet one can write a loop-induced lower dimensional
operator that renders the septet a non-viable DM representation, even if the eﬀective scale is assumed
to be MPlanck. Thus, within the minimal DM context the only viable representation is the fermion
quintet, although recently analyses have shown that depending on the DM proﬁle this representation is
not consistent with indirect DM searches results [31, 32] (see discussion in sec. 2).

In this paper we show that when the fermion quintet acts as a mediator in one-loop neutrino mass
generation, there are always DM decay operators that—under reasonable parameter choices—lead to
fast DM decays, regardless of the one-loop neutrino mass model. Some of these operators arise at the
tree level but others are loop-induced. The latter being specially important in models where in addition

1Seesaw-like scenarios with sizeable lepton-ﬂavor-violating eﬀects can be constructed, but they require deviations from

the “standard” type-I seesaw picture, see e.g. [3–5].

2Variants of the standard leptogenesis picture can be embedded within type-I seesaw or in other neutrino mass models

as well, see e.g. [11, 12].

to the fermion quintet, representations beyond quartets are present. We will show that as soon as the
minimal DM scheme is extended to include other representations (that allow the construction of one-
loop neutrino mass models) there are always Z2-breaking couplings, thus fast decay modes are always
expected to be present. We consider the case of the scalar septet as well, although is not consistent with
stability even in the minimal DM framework. The reason is that these results allow the identiﬁcation of
DM fast decay modes induced by neutrino physics itself, rather than due to a diﬀerent type of physics
(related with unknown quantum gravity eﬀects).

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In sec. 2, we brieﬂy review minimal DM models,
introduce our notation and present formulas that will be used in our estimations. In sec. 2.1, we present
the diﬀerent Z2-breaking decay operators and estimate lifetimes for various processes, showing that even
for neutrino physics parameters taken to their extreme values the decays are always fast. In sec. 3, we
systematically derive all one-loop realizations of the Weinberg operator, under the condition of the UV
completion containing either the fermion quintet or scalar septet. With these results at hand, we then
identify the diﬀerent DM decay operators associated with each of the neutrino mass model categories.
In sec. 4, we discuss the main pitfalls of models for Majorana neutrino masses with higher-order EW
representations and brieﬂy comment on models with higher-order loops. Finally, in sec. 5 we summarize
and present our conclusions.

2 Minimal dark matter and possible decay processes

Minimal DM models rely on the observation that for higher-order SU (2) representations, R, renormal-
izable gauge invariant operators of the form

ON =4 ∼ ROSM ,

(1)

where OSM is an operator involving just SM ﬁelds, are not possible writing in the presence of a single
such representation [27–29]. Thus, when the SM is endowed with such state, its stability is automatically
guaranteed. The stabilization mechanism at work, resembles the SM “mechanism” which assures proton
stability, namely the gauge symmetry does not allow for renormalizable operators that might induce
decay. Of course, at the non-renormalizable level several eﬀective operators of the form (1) can be
written, but their renormalizable realizations require degrees of freedom which the minimality criteria
do not allow for 3.

The lowest-order representation for which the above argument proves to be true and yields a viable
DM candidate is the fermionic R = 5. Let us discuss this in more detail. For R = 3, renormalizable
operators can always be written, regardless of whether they are fermions (F ) or scalars (S). This can
be readily understood from SU (2) product decompositions, for which one ﬁnds

This means that in the case R = 3, 2 ⊗ 2 ⊃ 3 and therefore

3Something of this sort is found in the SM as well. Baryon- and lepton-number-violating eﬀective interactions can be

written [1, 33], but their renormalizable forms require beyond-the-SM physical states.

With Y for this representation, and any other, being ﬁxed according to the condition that the multiplet
has an electrically neutral component. Hereafter we will use the notation RY
X, where X refers to fermion
(F ) or scalar (S) and Y to hypercharge, normalized according to: Q = T3 + Y . In the case R = 4,
the decomposition in (2) leads to 2 ⊗ 2 ⊗ 2 ⊃ 4 and so depending on the spin of the representation
non-renormalizable operators can be written, namely

(cid:40)

, ON =4 ∼ 4Y

OSM = H† H H†

(Y = 3/2)

.

However, though involving non-renormalizable operators, RF = 4F does not provide a viable DM can-
didate. First of all, even if the cutoﬀ scale is taken to be Λ = MPlanck (where arguably quantum gravity
eﬀects will generate such operator) its suppression is not suﬃciently strong to guarantee cosmological
stability. Furthermore, only Y = 0 representations are consistent with direct DM searches: For Y (cid:54)= 0
states, Z-mediated processes induce a tree-level spin-independent DM-nucleon cross section well above
the values allowed by current DM direct searches [27–29]. For RF = 5F one ﬁnds 2 ⊗ 2 ⊗ 2 ⊗ 2 ⊃ 5,
which then implies that SU (2) invariance requires ﬁve SM ﬁelds. Depending on the spin of the rep-
resentation, the eﬀective operator in (1) is N = 5 (scalar) or N = 6 (fermion), with its full structure
determined by the hypercharge of the corresponding state.

An upper limit on the size of the representations can be determined by the condition of α2 being
perturbative up to the Planck scale. Ref. [30] has shown that depending on the representation a precise
determination of the Landau pole should rely on two-loop RGE. Based on that analysis representations
RF > 5F and RS > 8S are ruled out, as has been previously pointed out in [27–29] using a one-loop
RGE calculation. One is left then with R = 5F,S and R = 7S for which the decay lifetimes can be
estimated from the eﬀective operator

Milky Way possesses a Navarro-Frenk-White or Einasto DM proﬁles this representation is ruled out
too [31, 32] 4. It can be however consistently considered in the context of cored proﬁles such as Burket
or Isothermal.

2.1 Minimal DM decay in the presence of extra degrees of freedom

Minimal DM instability is induced by UV completions associated with eﬀective operators of the type (3).
In the minimal model the new degrees of freedom are assumed to be related with quantum gravity eﬀects,
something that guarantees stability for 50
F . For UV completions associated with “lighter” physics, DM
can become cosmologically unstable. For Λ (cid:46) 1015 GeV, 50

F has a lifetime below 1026 seconds.

The neutrino mass one gets from one-loop realizations of the Weinberg operator can be estimated

as

(5)

where Y denotes a generic Yukawa coupling. Thus, assuming Y ⊂ [10−2, 1] and ﬁxing the neutrino mass
to mAtm = 0.05 eV [38–40], one can estimate Λ (cid:46) [105, 1013] GeV. Note that in this estimation the
one-loop function has been neglected, but in an speciﬁc model with an explicit neutrino mass matrix
the presence of the loop function will lead to smaller cutoﬀ scales. Thus, with the value derived from
(5) we are overestimating the DM lifetime.

This result then shows that—in principle—any one-loop UV completion of the Weinberg operator
F decays will lead

that can yield in turn an UV completion for the eﬀective operator responsible for 50

This Lagrangian is invariant under the Z2 transformations 5F → −5F and XSM → XSM, that entirely

results as a consequence of the gauge symmetry. If the extra representations that allow for the one-loop
neutrino mass matrix allow as well for UV completions of the following Lagrangian

Leﬀ =

(8)

they will necessarily involve interactions that explicitly break the accidental Z2 symmetry (as this oper-
ator does) and therefore will lead to DM decay processes with typical lifetimes given by (6). Instability
of the 70

S can be understood in the same way. The full Lagrangian is given by
7|7S|2 + λ1|7S|2|H|2 + ··· ,

(9)
where the ellipses refer to additional terms, that as the ones we have explicitly written are Z2-invariant.
In this case the relevant eﬀective Z2-breaking term is

L = |Dµ 7S|2 + VSM + m2

Leﬀ =

7S 7S 7S H† H .

(10)

This operator alone cannot yield DM decays, but when combined with the EW invariant H† H leads
to a one-loop dim=5 decay operator [30]. As in the fermionic DM case, instability of the 7S can be
understood as a consequence of renormalizable Z2-violating interactions that in the eﬀective limit reduce
to (10).

As already pointed out, decay modes depend upon the extra representations and can be sorted
according to tree level and one-loop induced decay modes. In what follows whenever calculating lifetimes
we will set mDM = 104 GeV and the mass of the extra representations, assumed to be universal (m), to
109 GeV, which is typically the largest value for the extra degrees of freedom one will get in a speciﬁc
neutrino mass model. With the relevant masses ﬁxed in this way, the Z2-conserving Yukawa couplings
(those related with neutrino mass generation: Yν) are ﬁxed to one 6. We start our analysis with the
tree level modes:

• Tree level decay modes for 50

6This parameter choice is a simpliﬁcation that enables determining the largest lifetimes achievable in each case. In
practice, however, these scales are not entirely independent and instead are constrained by phenomenological conditions
such as the DM relic abundance.

In single messenger scenarios containing 61/2

ﬁg. 2). The decay processes will involve two distinct scales, namely m and the scale at which the

α2 = g2
2/4π2 becomes non-perturbative or the Planck scale. Depending on the UV completion
leading to cS,F
the former can be rather low, and thus in some instances χDM decay can be fast. If
instead is MPlanck, these processes cannot threaten DM stability. All in all, if one relies only on tree
level processes one ends up with the conclusion that scenarios involving representations beyond

the quartet (scalar or fermionic) are consistent with DM stability. This conclusion however is
misleading since one-loop induced decay processes can always be written and can be fast enough
to render χDM cosmologically unstable.
• One-loop level decay modes for 50
In this case as well one can distinguish single and multiple messenger scenarios, for the former the
S . These representations enable a Z2-breaking quartic
relevant representations are R = 41/2
coupling which renders χDM unstable. The corresponding operators are shown in 3 (diagram to
the left). These operators lead to diﬀerent decay modes of which those with no Higgs condensation
attachment are dominant, e.g. ν W ∓ W ∓ ZL. One can conclude that in one-loop neutrino mass
models containing a 41/2
S , DM decays are fast and proceed via tree and one-loop level processes.
Thus in general is not cosmologically stable.
Loop-induced decay processes are of more relevance in models that contain a 61/2
S . At the tree
level these scenarios involve processes that lead to slow DM decay, and so seem consistent with
cosmological stability. In the eﬀective limit, the loop-induced processes are associated with dim=6
eﬀective operators whose cutoﬀ scale amounts (at most) to m = 109 GeV. Thus, an estimation
of the DM lifetime can be done from eq. (4) by rescaling by the loop factor. For processes such
as ν W ∓ W ∓ ZL the result reads:

Which shows that although the tree level decay does not yield fast decays, the loop-induced
processes lead to lifetimes that do not amount to 1026
seconds, under “reasonable” parameter
choices. This conclusion is inline with what was ﬁrst pointed out in ref. [20], showing the infea-
sibility of the RνMDM [18]. In the case of multiple messenger ﬁelds one ﬁnds Yukawa couplings
S, which break the Z2 accidental symmetry. Their presence allow
of the type R1/2
the construction of operators as those shown in ﬁg. 3 (diagram to the right), that induce again
processes such as χDM → ν W ∓ W ∓ ZL. The lifetime for these processes amounts to the value of
the single messenger case in (13).

We now turn to the 70
S DM scenario. As we have already stressed, in the context of minimal DM
this representation is not consistent with stability even for Λ = MPlanck. Thus, even if a one-loop
neutrino mass model does not involve degrees of freedom that can generate at the renormalizable level
the operator in (10)—arguably—quantum gravity eﬀects will generate it and therefore ϕDM ⊂ 70
S will
decay at a fast rate [30]. It is however worth identifying those extra representations that enable writing
UV completions of this eﬀective operator, in particular because these results will enable in turn the
identiﬁcation of one-loop neutrino mass models where ϕDM decays will be due to neutrino physics itself,
rather than due to a diﬀerent type of physics.
As in the fermionic DM scenario, in this case one can identify various Z2-breaking terms whose
structure depends on the extra representations present. We have found trilinear scalar couplings of the
F (R(cid:48)F )−1/2, with R = R(cid:48) = 6, 8 and R = 6 and
type 70
R(cid:48) = 8 (for both, fermions and scalars). With these vertices one can then construct a certain number
of loop-induced processes that lead to fast ϕDM decays. The diﬀerent operators are shown in ﬁg. 4. The
diﬀerent cases can be sorted in single and multiple messenger scenarios, but due to our universal mass
simpliﬁcation they lead to the same lifetime. Possible decay modes for operators to the left in ﬁg. 4
are W ±L W ∓L , while for those to the right l± l∓. In the eﬀective limit, m (cid:29) mDM, the decay lifetime for
processes induced by operators as those shown in the diagram to the left in ﬁg. 4 has been calculated
as [30]:

For processes with leptons modes (induced by the operators to the right in ﬁg. 4) the lifetime is larger,
as can be readily understood by realizing that the eﬀective operator is dim=6 rather than 5, as in the
pure scalar case. Though larger, the values are always well below what cosmological stability demands.

In order to be model-independent one has to consider all possible one-loop realizations of the lepton-
number-breaking dim=5 operator. The possibilities have been systematically sorted in [13], and dia-
grammatically their number reduces to four independent diagrams as shown in ﬁg. 5. We start by
assuming that one of the loop degrees of freedom is either R = 50
S. As soon as this inter-
nal representation is ﬁxed the remaining representations are ﬁxed by SU (2) × U (1)Y invariance. It is
worth emphasizing that in some instances the resulting representations allow for tree level realizations
of higher-order lepton-number-breaking operators (see e.g. ref. [19]). Their contributions to neutrino
masses are however negligible provided the BSM ﬁelds have masses above ∼ 3 TeV.

Results for the possible UV completions that contain a hypercharge-zero fermionic quintet are shown
in tab. 1. The diﬀerent models can be readily derived with the aid of the following SU (2) product
decompositions

2 ⊗ 5 = 4 ⊕ 6 ,

2 ⊗ 4 = 3 ⊕ 5 ,

2 ⊗ 6 = 5 ⊕ 7 ,

and thus rather than listing them one by one we discuss their generic features. A simple inspection to
F two representations for the internal scalars are possible, namely 41/2
D1 in ﬁg. 5, shows that ﬁxing 50
and 61/2
S . A diagram combining both is of course possible too. In terms of the necessary number of
representations, UV completions based on D1 deﬁne minimal scenarios. UV completions based on D2
require at least an additional scalar representation, and in contrast to those based on D1 are such that
the representation content always allow for two diﬀerent contributions to the eﬀective neutrino mass
matrix:

“pure” minimal DM) leads to fast DM decay. Despite that, here for completeness we identify the
diﬀerent one-loop neutrino mass models for which UV completions of that eﬀective decay operator can
be written.

The main results in this case are summarized in tab. 2. The speciﬁcation of the models in these
cases go along the same lines that in the quintet DM scenarios. But, in addition to the SU (2) products
in (16) other decompositions are needed, namely

2 ⊗ 7 = 6 ⊕ 8 ,

2 ⊗ 8 = 7 ⊕ 9 ,

2 ⊗ 9 = 8 ⊕ 10 .

(19)

With the aid of these product rules the diﬀerent UV completions, which we do not list, can be easily
derived. Their main features are the following. With one of the loop degrees of freedom ﬁxed according
to 70

relying on D2 are of two types: models where the mass matrix is entirely determined by D2-type
contributions and scenarios where the neutrino mass matrix has the form:

In D3-based scenarios the representations required imply in all cases a neutrino mass matrix of the
form

(21)

Finally, for UV completions involving D4 diagrams the neutrino mass matrix involves only D4 contri-
butions.
Regarding Z2-breaking modes, as shown in tab. 2 all UV completions of one-loop realizations of
the Weinberg operator always involve a Z2-violating decay mode. As we have pointed out in sec. 2.1,
compared with the fermion quintet these processes lead to faster DM decay since they are related with

11

dim=5 decay operators. The color scheme used is the same that in tab. 1: Yellowish (greenish) cells
for representations mean that those representations induce a Z2-breaking mode 1 (2), with the diﬀerent
modes referring to ﬁg. 4.

4 Pitfalls of DM from higher-order representations and neu-

trino masses

The diﬀerent decay modes we have identiﬁed depend upon neutrino-related parameters and Z2-breaking
couplings. In the estimations of lifetimes we have taken the former to their extreme values, while keeping
perturbative Yukawa couplings (Yν < 1). Thus, if one takes the extra representations to be heavier
the largest neutrino mass will be below mExp
Atm (cid:39) 0.05 eV. The only way that enables the increasing
of the lifetime is through couplings not related with neutrino physics that can be either Z2-breaking
or Z2-conserving. For neutrino-related parameters taken to their extreme values, couplings of order
10−11 or so (see e.g. eq. (13)) will lead to lifetimes of order 1026 seconds. Stability, however, is not
assured anymore by an accidental symmetry but from the smallness of a parameter whose value has no
dynamical origin7. Indeed, any deviation from such value will render fast DM decay, and this may be the
case if the parameter is not stable under RGE running. In general, SU (2) higher-order representations
lead to rapid RGE running. This turns out to be particularly relevant for quartic scalar couplings for
which it has been shown that even if their values are ﬁxed to zero at the EW scale they can reach a
Landau pole at rather low scales, for 70
S at about 106 GeV [42]. Thus, at least for quartic couplings
their running does not assure DM stability.

Even smaller couplings are required if one lowers the mass scale of the messenger ﬁelds. The point is
that with m ∼ 109 GeV any possible low-energy indirect probe (e.g. lepton-ﬂavor-violating or collider-
related observables) is well below current and future experimental sensitivities. Thus, testability of
these scenarios requires m (cid:28) 109 GeV. For scales comparable to those of DM the lifetimes are reduced
by several orders of magnitude and so smaller couplings, order 10−21 or so, are required to achieve
consistent lifetimes.

In neutrino mass models that contain extra representations as those we have identiﬁed in the previous
section (in addition to 50
S, or both) one expects DM to decay fast, with the decays determined
by Z2-violating operators (see ﬁgs. 2-4). The explicit breaking of the accidental Z2 symmetry renders
DM cosmologically unstable. Tuning of couplings is possible, but in that case cosmological stability is
unrelated with the mechanism underlying minimal DM models.

F or 70

A more plausible way of relating Majorana neutrino masses with accidentally stabilized DM is
through higher-order loops. In this case, SU (2)×U (1)Y invariance is less restrictive due to the topologies
of the possible diagrams. In the two-loop case, the topologies allow for overall shifts in the hypercharge
of the ﬁelds ﬂowing in the loops, while keeping Y = 0 for the DM representation (for the diﬀerent
topologies see ref. [14]). This “hypercharge freedom” might enable the construction of consistent two-
loop models. For three-loop models, as far as we are aware, two examples have been pointed out [24,25].
Ref. [24] considers a model with three 70
S. The neutral component of the lightest
F is cosmologically stable due to an accidental Z2 symmetry. Ref. [25], instead, considers a model
70
with three copies of the 50
F , in addition to a two-Higgs-
doublet model. In this case, the neutral component of the lightest 50
F is cosmologically stable. Although

Figure 6: Energy scale at which α2 reaches a Landau pole as a function of mX/mDM in the three-loop
neutrino models of [24, 25] (mX refers to the masses of the heavier fermion and scalars). The dashed
(reddish) curve is the result for the model in [24] with the DM mass ﬁxed to 20 TeV and the singlet
scalar (11
S) mass to 500 GeV. The dot-dashed (blueish) curve is for [25] with the DM mass ﬁxed to
10 TeV and the second doublet mass to 1 TeV. These results have been derived from two-loop RGEs
and neglecting Yukawa contributions [43]. They show that ΛLandau-pole ∼ mX, which in turn shows that
these models might be hard to reconcile with perturbativity criteria.

consistent with DM stability, neutrino physics data and low-energy lepton-ﬂavor-violating constraints,
we have found that in both cases α2 = g2
2/4π reaches a Landau pole at ΛLandau-pole ∼ mX (see ﬁg. 6),
where mX refers to the masses of the heavy representations which we have taken to be universal, for
simplicity. This result has been derived by integrating two-loop RGEs and neglecting Yukawa couplings
contributions. It shows that at about its characteristic energy scale (taken to be mX) these models
become non-perturbative, with such behavior being more pronounced for the model in [24]. Arguably,
this may be a drawback of these approaches. The presence of multiple higher-order representations
can lead to non-perturbative scenarios at scales comparable to the mass of some of its own degrees of
freedom.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we have presented a model-independent study of one-loop neutrino mass models in which
one of the loop messengers is a hypercharge-zero fermion quintet or a hypercharge-zero scalar septet.
In the absence of additional higher-order EW representations the neutral component of the quintet is
absolutely stable at the renormalizable level, and cosmologically stable when the leading-order eﬀective
operator responsible for its decay (dim=6) is included (assuming a cutoﬀ above 1015 GeV, see ﬁg. 1).
We have shown that such feature no longer holds in the presence of the extra degrees of freedom that
deﬁne the one-loop neutrino mass model, regardless of the model. For completeness we have extended
our analysis to include the case of a hypercharge-zero scalar septet, although this representation cannot
be reconciled with cosmological stability even in minimal DM scenarios.

We have systematically classiﬁed all such models and the corresponding DM decay operators in
each case. Our main ﬁndings are summarized in tabs. 1 and 2, combined with the diﬀerent DM decay
operators given in ﬁgs. 3 and 4. From these results our main conclusion is that one-loop neutrino

couplings—O ∼ 10−21 − 10−11 (with the value depending on the highest scale of the corresponding
neutrino mass model)—or ad hoc symmetries are assumed. The former being hard to reconcile in the
absence of a dynamical mechanism assuring such extreme small values, while the latter missing the
whole point behind higher-order EW representations8.

We have commented on neutrino mass models variations based on higher-order loops. We argued
that in the two-loop case, models consistent with DM stability might be possible to write due to the
“hypercharge freedom” that the two-loop topologies oﬀer. We have stressed that these models and
three-loop scenarios might be hard to reconcile with perturbativity criteria. We have illustrated that
for two speciﬁc three-loop models for which we have found that α2 reaches a Landau pole at rather low
energy scales (ﬁg. 6), ΛLandau-pole ∼ mX, with mX the characteristic scale of the model.
