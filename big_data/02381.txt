Abstract— This paper studies the problem of reconstructing
a two-dimensional scalar ﬁeld using a swarm of networked
robots with local communication capabilities. We consider the
communication network of the robots to form either a chain
or a grid topology. We formulate the reconstruction problem
as an optimization problem that is constrained by ﬁrst-order
linear dynamics on a large, interconnected system. To solve
this problem, we employ an optimization-based scheme that
uses a gradient-based method with an analytical computation
of the gradient. In addition, we derive bounds on the trace
of observability Gramian of the system, which helps us to
quantify and compare the estimation capability of chain and
grid networks. A comparison based on a performance measure
related to the H2 norm of the system is also used to study
robustness of the network topologies. Our resultsare validated
using both simulated scalar ﬁelds and actual ocean salinity data.

I. INTRODUCTION

S WARM robotics has emerged as important area of

research in recent years. Robotic swarms can be em-
ployed in scenarios where an individual robot is incapable
of or inefﬁcient at performing a task. Networked robotic
swarms can be used for distributed sensing and estimation
in various applications such as environmental monitoring,
ﬁeld surveillance, multi-target tracking, and geo-scientiﬁc
exploration [1] for large area monitoring. In numerous
multi-robot applications like formation control[2], control of
mobile platoons [3], multi target tracking [4], and sensor
networks for ﬁeld reconstruction [5] interesting problems
related to network topology and conﬁguration arise. One of
the primary motivations behind the work done in this paper
is to quantify the fundamental limitations that can emerge in
these applications due to the chosen topology of the network
structure. In particular, chain and grid topologies are com-
mon network choices for multi-robot applications. We ﬁnd
that even for ﬁrst-order information dynamics, the topology
of the network affects its performance on estimation and
robustness to noise. This implies that topology of network
could practically affect the performance of algorithms for
large inter-connected multi-robot systems.

In this paper, we present a method to estimate the full
set of initial measurements of a static scalar ﬁeld that are

obtained by a networked robotic swarm using the temporal
data collected by a subset of accessible robots. The robots
communicate with their neighbors through a ﬁxed commu-
nication network topology. A ﬁrst-order linear dynamical
model
is used to describe the information ﬂow in the
network. This procedure can also be adapted to estimate a
time-varying scalar ﬁeld whose dynamics are slower than
the network information dynamics. From a control theory
perspective,
the problem is essentially to ﬁnd the initial
condition of a linear dynamical system given its inputs and
outputs. The solution to this problem is associated with
observability of the system.

Although there is a great deal of literature on optimal
control, little work has addressed the optimal estimation of
initial conditions other than through the inversion of the
observability Gramian [6]. In general, the observability of a
linear dynamical system can be veriﬁed by using the Kalman
rank condition [7]. However, checking the rank condition
for large interconnected systems is computationally intensive
due to the high dimensionality of the observability Gramian.
For this reason, a less computationally intensive graph-
theoretic characterization of observability has been more
widely used than a matrix-theoretic characterization for large
complex networked systems. The observability of complex
networks is studied in [8] using a graph-based approach,
which presents a general result that holds true for most of
the chosen network parameters (the edge weights). In [9], a
graph-theoretic approach based on equitable partitions graphs
is used to derive necessary conditions for observability of
networks. Alternately, [10] use a matrix-theoretic approach
to develop a maximum multiplicity theory to characterize the
exact controllability of a network in terms of the minimum
number of required independent controller nodes based on
the network spectrum.

that

In our problem, we focus only on the grid and chain
network topologies. The main reason for this choice is
the fact
these networks are common candidates for
approximating 1D and 2D domains in practical applications.
Another major reason behind restricting our focus on the
analysis of these networks is because the necessary and
sufﬁcient conditions for the observability spectral properties
of these networks are well understood from literature [11],
[12]. In terms of the analysis done in this paper we adopt a
quantitative measure of observability based on the trace of
observability Gramian similar to [13], [14], [15], [16], [17],
departing from graph theoretic methods used in [9], [8], [11],
[18].

The main contributions of this paper are as follows.

First, we propose a method to estimate the initial condition
of linear dynamical network system with large dimensions
using an optimization framework and deriving the gradient
required to solve it. Second, we derive bounds on the trace
of the observability Gramian of the network system and use
these results to compare the estimation capability of grid and
chain networks. Third, we use a performance measure based
on the H2 norm of a system to quantify the robustness of
these network system to noise. We illustrate our approach on
both simulated and actual two-dimensional scalar ﬁelds.

The paper is organized as follows. II introduces mathemat-
ical concepts and terminology that are used in the paper. III
describes the problem statement and outlines the assumptions
made in its formulation. The network model is presented
in IV. V delineates how the scalar ﬁeld reconstruction
can be posed as an optimization problem and computes
the analytical gradient required for its solution. Simulation
details and results are described in VI. We derive bounds
on the trace of the observability Gramian in VII, which
aids us in comparing network topologies. VIII discusses a
performance analysis of the network topologies based on the
H2 norm of the system. Finally, IX concludes the paper and
proposes future work.

II. MATHEMATICAL PRELIMINARIES

A graph G can be deﬁned as the tuple (V(G ),E(G )),
where V(G ) is a set of N vertices, or nodes, and E(G ) =
{(i, j) : i (cid:54)= j, i, j ∈ V(G )} is a set of M edges. Nodes i and j
are called neighbors if (i, j) ∈ E(G ). The set of neighbors of
node i is denoted by Ni = { j : j ∈ V(G ), (i, j) ∈ E(G )}. The
degree di of a node i is deﬁned as |Ni|. We assume that G
is ﬁnite, simple, and connected unless mentioned otherwise.
A graph G is associated with several matrices whose
spectral properties will be used to derive our results. The
incidence matrix of a graph with arbitrary orientation is
deﬁned as B(G ) = [bi j] ∈ RN×M, where the entry bi j = 1
if i is the initial node of some edge j of G , bi j = −1 if
i is the terminal node of some edge j of G , and bi j = 0
otherwise. It can be shown that the left nullspace of B(G )
is c1N, c ∈ R, where 1N is the N × 1 vector of ones [19].
The degree matrix ∆(G ) of a graph is given by ∆(G ) =
Diag(d1, ...,dN). The adjacency matrix A(G ) = [ai j] ∈ RN×N
has entries ai j = 1 when (i, j) ∈ E(G ) and ai j = 0 otherwise.
The graph Laplacian can be deﬁned from these two matrices
as L(G ) = ∆(G ) − A(G ). The Laplacian of an undirected
graph is symmetric and positive semideﬁnite, which implies
that it has real nonnegative eigenvalues λi(G ), i = 1, ...n.
The eigenvalues can be ordered as λ1(G ) ≤ λ2(G ) ≤ ... ≤
λN(G ), where λ1(G ) = 0. The eigenvector corresponding to
eigenvalue λ1(G ) can be computed to be 1N. By Theorem
2.8 of [20], the graph is connected if and only if λ2(G ) > 0.
Several other matrices will be deﬁned as follows. An n1×
n2 identity matrix will be denoted by In1×n2, and an n1 × n2
matrix of zeros will be denoted by 0n1×n2. The matrix JN is
deﬁned as JN = 1T

N1N.

III. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Consider a set of N robots with local communication
ranges and local sensing capabilities. The robots are arranged
in a bounded domain as shown in 1. Each robot is capable
of measuring the value of a scalar ﬁeld at its location and
communicating this value to its neighbors, which are deﬁned
as the robots that are within its communication range. The
robots take measurements at some initial time and transmit
this information using a nearest-neighbor averaging rule,
which is described in IV. As shown in 1, we assume to
have direct access only to the measurements of a small
subset of the robots, which we call the accessible robots,
which for instance may be closer to a particular boundary
of the domain. We also assume that the robot positions
are predetermined and that
the robots employ feedback
mechanisms to regulate their positions in the presence of
external disturbances.

We address the problem of reconstructing the initial mea-
surements taken by all the robots from the measurements of
the accessible robots. This can be formulated as the problem
of determining whether the information ﬂow dynamics in the
network are observable with respect to a set of given outputs.
As mentioned in I, this is a difﬁcult problem to solve for
arbitrary communication topologies. Hence, we restrict our
investigation to chain and grid communication topologies,
whose structural observability properties are well-studied
[11], [18]. We will focus on comparing the chain and
grid topologies in terms of their utility as communication
networks to be used in reconstructing an initial set of data.

NETWORK MODEL

and

The communication network among the N robots is rep-
resented by an undirected graph G = (V(G ),E(G )), where
vertex i ∈ V(G ) denotes robot i, and robots i and j can
communicate with each other if (i, j) ∈ E(G ). Let xi(t) ∈ R
be a scalar data value obtained by robot i at time t. We deﬁne
the information ﬂow dynamics of robot i as

L(Gg) =

dxi
dt = ∑
(i, j)∈Ni

(x j − xi).

(1)

The vector of all robots’ information at time t is denoted
by X(t) = [x1(t) x2(t) ... xN(t)]T . Using 1 to deﬁne the
dynamics of xi(t) for each robot
i, we can deﬁne the
information ﬂow dynamics over the entire network as

where



˙X(t) = −L(G )X(t),
X(0) = X0,

(2)

where X0 ∈ RN contains the unknown initial values of the
data obtained by the robots at time t = 0, which is the
information that we want to estimate.
We deﬁne Id ={I1,I2, ...,Ik}⊆ V(G ) as the index set of the
accessible robots. The output equation for the linear system
2 is given by

Y(t) = CX(t),

(3)

where Y(t) ∈ Rk and C = [ci j] ∈ Rk×N is a sparse matrix
whose entries are deﬁned as ci j = 1 if i = j and i ∈ Id, ci j = 0
otherwise. If we number the robots in such a way that the
ﬁrst k output nodes (robots) are ordered from 1 to k, then

C =(cid:2)Ik×k 0k×(N−k)

(cid:3).

As previously discussed, we focus on the case where the
network has a chain or grid communication topology. The
type of topology affects the network dynamics through its
associated graph Laplacian L(Gg). Let Gc and Gg represent
communication networks with a chain topology and a grid
topology, respectively. When the robots in each network are
labeled as shown in 1(a) and 1(b), then it can be shown that
L(Gc) and L(Gg) [12] have the following structures:

Here, L(Gg) is a (l1l2)× (l1l2) matrix and D1,D2 are both
l1×l1 matrices, with l1l2 = N. Without loss of generality, we
assume that the grid is square, meaning that l1 = l2 = l. We
direct the reader to [21] for a numerical example of L(Gg).
The graph Laplacians L(Gc) and L(Gg) are constructed
based on the numbering of the vertex sets V(Gc) and V(Gg)
that is shown in 1. Graphs that are constructed by reordering
the vertices of the graphs shown in 1 are isomorphic to the
graphs in the ﬁgure. Isomorphic graphs are also isospectral
[22].

Since the system 2 is linear, its solution is [7]

X(t) = e−L(G )tX0.

(6)

By combining 3 and 6, we obtain the map between the

unknown initial data X0 and the measured output Y(t) as

Y(t) = Ce−L(G )tX0.

V. FIELD RECONSTRUCTION

The problem of scalar ﬁeld reconstruction can now be
framed as an inversion of the map given by 7. From linear
systems theory, the property of observability refers to the
ability to determine an initial state X0 from the inputs and
outputs of a linear dynamical system [7]. For systems deﬁned
by 2 with an associated chain or grid topology, the conditions
for observability are well-studied [11]. This ensures that
the reconstruction problem can be solved for the types of
networks that we consider.

We solve the scalar ﬁeld reconstruction problem by posing
it as an optimization problem. The optimization procedure
uses observed data ˆY(t) from the accessible robots over
the time interval t ∈ [0 T ] to recover X0. The goal of the
optimization routine is to ﬁnd the state X0 that minimizes
the normed distance between this observed data, ˆY(t), and
the output Y(t) computed using 7. Therefore, we can frame
our optimization objective as the computation of X0 that
minimizes the functional J(X0), deﬁned as
λ

subject to the constraint given by 7. Here, λ is the Tikhonov
regularization parameter, which is added to the objective
function to prevent X0 from becoming large due to noise
in the data [23].

The convexity of J(X0) ensures the convergence of gradi-
ent descent methods to its global minima. We use one such
method to compute the X0 that minimizes this functional.
The method requires us to compute the gradient of J(X0)
with respect to X0. This is done by combining 7 and 8, then
taking the Gˆateaux derivative of the resulting expression with
respect to X0 [24]. Deﬁning Ψ(t) = Ce−L(G )t, the gradient
of J(X0) can be computed in this way as:

∗(cid:0)Ψ(t)X0 − ˆY(t)(cid:1)dt + λX0,

(cid:90) T
(9)
∗ is the Hermitian adjoint of Ψ(t), which in this

where (Ψ(t))
case is simply the Hermitian transpose [24].

δ J(X0) =

(Ψ(t))

The most computationally intensive part of calculating 9
is computing the matrix exponential in Ψ(t). There has been
a great deal of literature about approximate computation
of the matrix exponential [25], [26] which by deﬁnition
is an inﬁnite matrix series. In general, ﬁnding the matrix
exponential is a computationally hard problem for very large
matrices and computing them can be error-prone if not done
carefully, especially if spectral decomposition [27] of the
matrix is not possible [28]. We can calculate the gradient
by noting that Y(t) = Ψ(t)X0 by 7, applying a change of
variables τ = T − t to the integral term in 9, and deﬁning
ˆu(τ) ≡ Y(T − τ)− ˆY(T − τ):

This expression can be thought of as the solution P(τ) of

the following differential equation at time τ = T [7]:
dτ = −L∗(G )P(τ) + C∗ ˆu(τ), P(0) = 0.

Using this result, the gradient 9 can be written as

δ J(X0) = P(T ) + λX0.

To compute the gradient, we can solve 10 forward to ﬁnd

VI. SIMULATIONS

We applied the method described in V to reconstruct a
Gaussian scalar ﬁeld using 100 robots, whose communica-
tion network either has a chain topology or a grid topology.
The simulations were performed on a normalized domain of
size 1 m × 1 m. The ﬁeld was reconstructed over a time
period of 50 sec using the data from a set of 30 accessible
robots. 2 and 3 illustrate the results from using the chain and
grid topologies, respectively. Each ﬁgure shows the contour
plots of the actual ﬁeld, the estimated ﬁeld, and absolute
value of the error between these plots. From these plots, it is
evident that the grid topology yields a much more accurate
reconstruction of the ﬁeld than the chain topology, even
though both networks can be characterized as observable.

In order to test the performance of our technique in a
practical scenario, we applied it to real data on the salinity
(psu) of a section of the Atlantic ocean at a depth of 25 m,
obtained from [29]. The ﬁeld was reconstructed over a time
period of 50 sec using 100 robots with a grid communication
topology and 30 accessible robots whose temporal data was
sampled at 10 Hz. The contour plots in 4 show that the
estimated salinity ﬁeld reproduces the key features of the
actual ﬁeld with reasonable accuracy.

VII. COMPARISON OF NETWORK TOPOLOGIES
In this section, we analyze the effect of network topology
on the accuracy of the ﬁeld estimation as the number
of robots in the network increases. Comparing the results
in 2 and 3, it is evident that there is some fundamental
limitation arising from the network structure which makes
the system with the chain topology practically unobservable.
In the control theory literature, the degree of observability
is used as a metric of a system’s observability [17]. The
observability Gramian WO(0,T ) can be used to compute the
initial state of an observable linear system from output data
over time t ∈ [0 T ] [7]. This makes it a good candidate for
use in quantifying the relative observability among different
systems. Due to the duality of controllability and observ-
ability, the results associated with one of these properties
can be used for the other if interpreted properly. Commonly
used measures of the degree of observability (controllability)
are the smallest eigenvalue, the trace, the determinant, and
the condition number of the observability (controllability)
Gramian [14], [15], [16]. For large, sparse networked sys-
tems,
the Gramian can be highly ill-conditioned, which
makes numerical computation of its minimum eigenvalue
unstable. Although researchers have computed bounds on the
minimum eigenvalues of the Gramian [13], these bounds did
not help to us arrive at a conclusion since they were too
close together.

These factors prompted us to use the trace of the observ-
ability Gramian as our metric for the degree of observability.
Analogous to the interpretation of the controllability Gramian
in [13],
the trace of the observability Gramian can be
interpreted as the average sensing effort applied by a system
to estimate its initial state. For a communication network
represented by G with information ﬂow dynamics given by
2, the trace of the observability Gramian WO(0,T ) is deﬁned
as

Following steps similar to those in [13], we use 1 below
to derive upper and lower bounds on the trace of the
observability Gramian for networks with chain and grid
topologies. 5 compares these lower and upper bounds for two

required by the chain network is greater than that of the grid
network for a given measurement energy, which is deﬁned
as (cid:107)Y(t)(cid:107)2

nonzero and are equal to 1. Thus, we obtain the upper bound:

We can compute these bounds on the trace of the observ-
ability Gramian for L(Gc) and L(Gg) since the eigenvalues

VIII. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

In this section, we analyze the effect of noise on the output
of ﬁrst-order linear dynamics that evolve on chain and grid
network topologies. We assume that the data at each node in
the network is affected by white noise with zero mean and
unit covariance. Therefore, the augmented system dynamics
described by 2 can be written as

˙X(t) = −L(G )X(t) + W,

(17)
where W ∈ RN denotes a zero mean, unit covariance white
noise process. The output equation is the same as 3.

As deﬁned in the robust control literature, the H2 norm
of a system gives the steady-state variance of the output
when the input
to the system is white noise and when
−L(G ) is Hurwitz [32]. However, for unstable systems, the
ﬁnite steady-state variance can be computed only when the
unstable modes are unobservable from the outputs [33]. For
L(G ), zero is the only unsteady mode with correspond-
ing eigenvector 1N, which does not affect the steady-state
variance of the output. If we can make the zero mode
unobservable, then it is still possible to use the H2 norm
as a measure to quantify the effect of noise on the system
output.

In order to do so, we follow the approach in [34],
which uses the ﬁrst-order Laplacian energy. This quantity
is essentially the H2 norm of a system if the matrix C in
3 is chosen in such a way that it annihilates the vector
1N. This can be done by deﬁning C to be an incidence
matrix of a graph Gk. Denoting this new C by ˆC, we have
that L(Gk) = ˆCT ˆC. Then L(Gk)1N = 0, which implies that
ˆC1N = 0 since ker( ˆC) = ker( ˆCT ˆC). Note that ˆC need not
necessarily be the incidence matrix of a graph Gk; the only
condition required is that ˆCT ˆC = L(Gk).

Now, if Gk is chosen to be a weighted complete graph
N , then L(Gk) = IN×N −
(L(G )), for the

KN whose edges all have weight 1

chain network topologies as a function of the total number of
nodes in the network. The plot shows that the grid network
is more effective than the chain network at mitigating the
effect of noise on the system output for a given number of
nodes.

IX. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have presented a methodology to estimate
the initial state of a large networked system of robots
with ﬁrst-order linear information dynamics using output
measurements from a subset of robots. We have quantiﬁed
the advantages of a grid network over a chain network in
the estimation of a two-dimensional scalar ﬁeld, even though
both networks can be made observable by construction. We
have also used a performance measure based on the H2
norm of the network to characterize the robustness of the
network dynamics based on its structure. A straightforward
extension of this work is to compare the chain and grid
topologies with similar degree distributions using the same
methodology. Another interesting aspect
to investigate is
the effect of structural uncertainty in the networks, which
could be done by quantifying the observability radius of the
network systems, as deﬁned in [35]. In addition, we would
like to compare network topologies in an alternative way by
viewing L(Gc) and L(Gg) as approximations to the Laplace
operator for 1D and 2D heat equations and analyzing the
Gramians of these partial differential equations [36].
