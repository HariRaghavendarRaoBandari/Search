A well-known situation in which a non-Markovian dynamics of an open quantum system S arises is
when this is coherently coupled to an auxiliary system M in contact with a Markovian bath. In such
cases, while the joint dynamics of S-M is Markovian and obeys a standard (bipartite) Lindblad-type
master equation (ME), this is in general not true for the reduced dynamics of S. Furthermore, there
are several instances (e.g. the dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model) in which a closed ME for the
S’s state cannot even be worked out. Here, we ﬁnd a class of bipartite Lindblad-type MEs such
that the reduced ME of S can be derived exactly and in a closed form for any initial product state
of S-M . We provide a detailed microscopic derivation of our result in terms of a mapping between
two collision models.

INTRODUCTION

The ability to manipulate a single, low-dimensional quan-
tum system S is key to the emerging ﬁeld of quantum tech-
nologies. However, due to its unavoidable interaction with
the surrounding environment, the dynamics of any realis-
tic quantum system S is open, i.e. non-unitary, and this is
typically detrimental to the eﬀectiveness of such technolo-
gies. A thorough and reliable description of the dynamics
of an open quantum system [1] is thus of utmost impor-
tance, especially in the case of non-Markovian dynamics,
as witnessed by the strong current interest in this topic [2].

In the best case, a full description of the reduced quan-
tum dynamics of S can be given in terms of a closed, well-
behaved, master equation (ME) with the density matrix
of S as the only unknown. Often, however, this is not
the case especially for non-Markovian open dynamics. A
paradigmatic and relatively simple example is the decay of
an atom in a single-mode lossy cavity as described by the
well-known dissipative Jaynes-Cummins model. The bipar-
tite atom-mode dynamics is governed by a Kossakowski-
Lindblad ME [1], featuring a Hamiltonian term (depending
on the atom-mode Hamiltonian) and a Lindbladian dissi-
pator acting on the cavity mode. In this case, tracing out
the mode degrees of freedom does not lead to a closed ME
for the atom [4]. The dissipative Jaynes-Cummins model
can be regarded as an instance of a bipartite Lindblad ME
in which a quantum system S is coherently coupled to a
second one M , the “memory”, the latter interacting with
a Markovian bath according to an associated Lindbladian
superoperator acting on M only.

In this paper, we present a class of MEs of the type
discussed above which, upon trace over the M ’s degrees
of freedom and for any initial S-M product state, yield
a closed, exact, ME for S. This is an integro-diﬀerential
memory-kernel ME, deﬁned in terms of the dynamical map
of S that would arise if M were decoupled from its envi-
ronment (hence corresponding to a unitary S-M joint dy-
namics). The resulting memory-kernel ME is well-behaved,

meaning that the corresponding dynamics of S is ensured
to be completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) [1].
Very recently, Chruscinski ans Kossakowski [5] studied a
parametrization of legitimate memory kernels entering the
general Nakajima-Zwanzig (NZ) ME [1], showing that a
number of well-behaved non-Markovian MEs can be ar-
ranged in the NZ form. We will show that this is true
also for our ME.

Furthermore, this ME is not restricted to the scenario
in which the system-environment coupling is mediated via
the ancillary degrees of freedom M but applies to a broader
class of non-Markovian dynamics. Indeed as we will show,
the memory-kernel ME for S discussed in this paper is
a generalisation of a ME ﬁrst derived through a collision
model of non-Markovian open quantum dynamics [6] (for
a diﬀerent perspective derivation see Ref. [7]). A quan-
tum collision model (CM) [8] is a microscopic framework
to describe the open dynamics of a system S interacting
with a reservoir assumed to consist of a large collection of
smaller constituents (ancillas). The system is assumed to
interact with the environment via a sequence of “collisions”
between system and ancillas, each collision being described
by the same bipartite quantum map (usually a unitary one).
The resulting reduced dynamics of S is, by construction, a
CPTP map. In the limit of weak coupling this leads to a
well-behaved ME. CMs have been a useful tool to analyze
quantum homogenization and thermalization [9], to derive
MEs [10], to study the interaction with small environments
and or with random unitaries [11], in quantum thermody-
namics [13] and in the study of quantum non-Markovianity
[14, 15]. Experimentally, a CM can be implemented in all-
optical setups [16].
In the second part of this paper, we
will illustrate two diﬀerent environmental memory mecha-
nisms in the context of collision models, both of which lead
to reduced open dynamics governed by our ME. We will
ﬁrst show that – when appropriately generalised – the CM
without memory M but with inter-ancillary collisions intro-
duced in Ref. [6] yields, in the continuous-time limit, our
memory-kernel ME. In this model, memory eﬀects are to
be ascribed to an intraenvironmental incoherent dynamics.

Next, we introduce a diﬀerent CM, with no inter-ancillary
collisions, for a bipartite system S-M , with M undergoing
collisions with the reservoir ancillas. This model mimics sit-
uations like the one encountered in the dissipative Jaynes-
Cummings model. We will show that both collision models
lead to the same discrete open dynamics for S. Moreover,
in the continuous-time limit, the latter CM leads to the
class of bipartite MEs that can be exactly traced over M
to produce our closed memory-kernel ME for S.

Interestingly, the idea of associating a non-Markovian dy-
namics with a Lindbladian dynamics on an enlarged space
(obtained by adding ancillary degrees of freedom to the
system) has been recently investigated [17, 18] (see also
references therein).

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we for-
mulate without proof our central ﬁnding, namely that a
certain class of bipartite Lindbladian MEs – whose deﬁni-
tion is given in detail – under partial trace over M yields a
memory-kernel ME for S. A direct proof of this result, ob-
tained by carrying out the partial trace of the bipartite ME
with the help of the Laplace transform, is given in Section
III. In Section IV, we illustrate a ﬁrst CM featuring inter-
ancillary collisions that leads, in the continuos-time limit,
to our reduced memory-kernel ME. In Section V, we deﬁne
a second CM describing the interaction of a bipartite sys-
tem S-M with a memoryless reservoir (no inter-ancillary
collisions) and show that the resulting discrete dynamics of
S coincides with the one occurring in the CM of Section
IV. Accordingly, in the continuous-time limit such reduced
dynamics is governed by the memory-kernel ME discussed
in Sections II and III. General comments and ﬁnal conclu-
sions are presented in Section VI. Some technical details
and proofs are given in the Appendix.

II. THE CLOSED MEMORY-KERNEL MASTER

EQUATION

Let S be a quantum system of arbitrary dimension whose
state we will denote as “ρ”. A second quantum system M
(the “memory”) of arbitrary dimension is coupled to S. Let
ˆHSM be the total S-M Hamiltonian. M is additionally in
contact with a bath such that the evolution of the joint
state ρSM (t) is governed by the Kossakowski-Linbdlad ME
(we set  = 1 throughout)

where [···,···]+ denotes the anticommutator (the reason for

the jump operators ˆLµν act on the Hibert space of M only,
as emphasized by the subscript “M ” in LM . Physically,

Eq. (1) describes the situation in which S is coherently
coupled to M while the latter is in contact with a Marko-
vian bath. Accordingly, while the joint S-M dynamics is
Markovian, the reduced dynamics of S is in general non-
Markovian. A paradigmatic instance is the well-known
dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model [3], where a two-level
atom (embodying S) is coupled to a lossy cavity mode (em-
bodying M ).

While – even in cases as (relatively) simple as the afore-
mentioned dissipative Jaynes-Cummins model – a partial
trace over the M ’s degrees of freedom of Eq. (1) does not
lead to a closed ME for ρ(t) = Tr{ρSM (t)} [4], here, we
present a class of MEs of the form (1) where a closed and
exact ME for ρ(t) is found.

Let the initial S-M state be a product state of the form

ρSM (0) = ρ0 ⊗ ¯ηM

(3)

where ρ0 and ¯ηM are arbitrary states of S and M respec-
tively (tensor product symbols will be at times omitted in
the remainder of this work). Also, let ηM be an arbitrary
state of M [in general diﬀerent from ¯ηM in Eq. (3)], which
we express in a diagonal form in terms of its eigenstates
{|ν(cid:105)M} as

ηM =

Note that the jump operators (5) obey the completeness
ˆLµν = 11M , as immediately follows from the
completeness of the eigenstates |ν(cid:105)M and the normalization
of the pν. Note that LM is deﬁned in terms of the state ηM
while ˆHSM [cf. Eq. (1)] is fully arbitrary.
In the next section, we will show that for such a class
of bipartite Lindbladian MEs the reduced dynamics of S
obeys exactly the closed memory-kernel ME

where Γ≥ 0 is a rate while E(t) and Φ(t) are CPTP quan-

Φ(t)[ρ] = TrM [e−i ˆHSM tρ ⊗ ¯ηM ei ˆHSM t] .

ME (6) is a generalisation of the memory-kernel ME ﬁrst
introduced in Ref. [6] (see also Ref. [7]). Speciﬁcally, the
latter is retrieved in the special case E(t) ≡ Φ(t), namely
In Appendix A, we

(cid:90) t

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

will provide a direct proof that the ME (6) entails a CPTP
dynamics of S for any Γ≥ 0 and any pair states {ηM , ¯ηM}
of M .
To illustrate the nature of the quantum channel corre-
sponding to the ME (1) and in particular to the Lindbladian
LM , consider the case in which M is a qubit, whose Hilbert
space is spanned by the othonormal basis {|0(cid:105)M ,|1(cid:105)M}, and
ηM =|0(cid:105)M(cid:104)0|. For the sake of simplicity, let us assume here
that the M ’s initial state and the state deﬁning the Lind-
bladian [see Eqs. (4) and (5)] are the same, i.e., ¯ηM = ηM .
According to Eq. (5), the Lindbladian LM is then deﬁned
by the pair of jump operators

ˆL00 =|0(cid:105)M(cid:104)0| =

ˆσM z +11M

2

, ˆL10 =|0(cid:105)M(cid:104)1| = ˆσM− ,

(9)

where, as usual, ˆσM z =|0(cid:105)M(cid:104)0|−|1(cid:105)M(cid:104)1| is a Pauli operator,
ˆσM− = ˆσ†M + =|0(cid:105)M(cid:104)1| are ladder operators while 11M is the
identity. Hence, the Lindbladian LM entering ME (1) takes
the explicit form

LM [ρSM ] =

[ˆσM + ˆσM−, ρSM ]+

ˆσM− ρSM ˆσM +−

(ˆσM z ρSM ˆσM z−ρSM ) .

(10)

The system is thus subject to both dissipation, with jump
operator ˆσM−, and dephasing, with jump operator ˆσM z,
both acting on the auxiliary system M . Remarkably, the
corresponding rates of these two decoherence processes
must be in the deﬁnite 4 : 1 ratio. In the case that S is also
a qubit coupled to M via an XX-type interaction Hamil-
tonian (this assigns the form of Hamiltonian ˆHSM ), the
resulting ME (6), including its exact solution, has been
studied in Ref. [15].

In Section III, we provide a direct proof that ME (6)
exactly describes the reduced dynamics of S entailed by
Eq. (1) when LM is given by Eq. (5).

III. DIRECT PROOF

A. The master equation in the Laplace space

For the sake of notation compactness, let us deﬁne the
superoperator HSM [···] = [ ˆHSM ,···] so that ME (1) can be
written as

˙ρSM =−iHSM [ρSM ]+ΓLM [ρSM ]

(11)

with the initial condition (3). Furthermore, let us note that,
thanks to Eqs. (4) and (5), the Lindbladian (2) transforms
an arbitrary joint state of S and M as

LM [ρSM ] = TrM{ρSM}ηM − ρSM .

(12)

Let ˜ρSM (s) be the Laplace transform (LT) of ρSM (t),
where s lies on the complex plane. Taking the LT of both
sides of Eq. (11) and replacing LM with Eq. (12), we ﬁnd

s˜ρSM (s)−ρSM (0) =−iHSM [ρSM (s)]

+Γ[TrM{˜ρSM (s)} ηM − ˜ρSM (s)] ,(13)

which can be viewed as a special case, for Γ1 = Γ, of the
following, more general, equation

(s+Γ+iHSM )[˜ρSM (s)]−ρSM (0) = Γ1 TrM{ρSM (s)} ηM (14)
under the same initial condition (3). The solution of
Eq. (14), which depends on both Γ and Γ1, for a given
value of Γ, can be expanded in powers of Γ1 as

˜ρSM (s) =

Γk−1

1

˜ρ(k)
SM (s)

(15)

∞(cid:88)

k=1

where each ˜ρ(k)
SM (s) parametrically depends on Γ. The so-
lution of our Eq. (13) can thus be obtained by evaluating
the ˜ρ(k)

SM (s) and then setting Γ1 = Γ in Eq. (15).

(cid:40)

To determine ˜ρ(k)

SM (s), we replace expansion (15) in
Eq. (14) so as to end up with the set of equations (one
for each power of Γ1)
(s+Γ+iHSM )[˜ρ(1)
(s+Γ+iHSM )[˜ρ(k)

ηM (k ≥ 2) .
The ﬁrst equation (corresponding to the 0th power in Γ1)
immediately yields

SM (s)] = ρSM (0) ,
SM (s)] = TrM

˜ρ(k−1)
SM (s)

(cid:111)

(cid:110)

˜ρ(1)
SM (s) = ˜USM (s + Γ) [ρSM (0)] ,

where

˜USM (s) = (s + iHSM )−1 .

Note that ˜USM (s) is the LT of the quantum map

USM (t) = e−iHSM t ,

(16)

(17)

(18)

namely the unitary dynamical map on S-M corresponding
to the ME (1) [or equivalently Eq. (11)] for Γ = 0, i.e., in
the absence of interaction with the reservoir. Furthermore,
for k≥ 2, we have

(cid:104)

(cid:110)

(cid:105)

˜ρ(k)
SM (s) = ˜U(s + Γ)

TrM

ρ(k−1)
SM (s)

,

(19)

which is a recurrence relation allowing to determine each
˜ρ(k)
SM (s). Replacing these in Eq. (15) and setting Γ1 = Γ, we
thus get the solution of ME (13) in the Laplace space.

B. The reduced dynamics of S

We now derive the reduced dynamics of S, i.e., we eval-
uate ρ(t) = TrM{ρSM (t)}. Let ˜ρ(s) be the LT of ρ(t), from
Eq. (15), it follows

˜ρ(s) =

SM (s) given by Eqs. (16) and (19).

where ρ0 is the initial state of S.
In the absence of any
other type of dynamical processes, at the nth step the joint
S-R state is
σn = ( ˆUSn··· ˆUS2 ˆUS1)ρ0⊗η1⊗η2⊗ ...ηn( ˆUSn··· ˆUS2 ˆUS1)† . (25)
Provided the system collides only once with the same an-
cilla this leads to a fully Markovian open dynamics for
Indeed, if ρn = TrR{σn} ≡ Trn{σn}, at the nth-step:
S.
ρn =Eτ [ρn−1] =E n
τ [ρ0], where map Eτ =E(τ ) coincides with
Eq. (7) for t = τ and η ≡ ηM . The above would give rise
to a standard memoryless CM [8, 9] (note that the discrete
dynamical map E n
τ fulﬁls the semigroup property), which
in the continuous-time limit gives rise to a Lindblad-type
ME for S [10].

A way to endow the open dynamics of S with memory
is to introduce inter-ancillary pairwise collisions occurring
between consecutive system-ancilla (SA) interactions.
In
other words, the collision between S and the nth ancilla is
followed by a collision between the nth and (n+1)th ancillas,
which is in turn followed by a new collision involving S
and the (n+1)th ancilla, then by a new collision between
ancillas n + 1 and n + 2, and so on. A pictorial sketch of
such dynamics is given in Fig. 1(a). In line with Ref. [6]

We will additionally need the LTs of maps E(t) and Φ(t)
on S, which in the light of Eqs. (7) and (8) can be expressed
in terms of the joint map (17) as

˜E(s)[ρ] = TrM
˜Φ(s)[ρ] = TrM

arbitrary k≥ 1

TrM

SM (s)

with ˜E 0 = IS. Substituting into Eq. (20), the solution for

ρ(s) thus reads

˜ρ(s) =

(23)

It is straightforward to show (see Appendix A) that in the
Laplace representation this precisely coincides with the so-
lution of ME (6) under the initial condition (3). This shows
that MEs (1) and (6) correspond to the same open dynam-
ics of S, which completes our proof.

In the remainder of this paper, we will show how the
steps leading from MEs (1) to (6) can be described and
understood in terms of CMs in the continuous time limit.

IV. A COLLISION MODEL WITH INTERNAL

MEMORY

In collision models the reservoir R consists of a large col-
lection of identical ancillas – here labeled with a positive
integer n = 1, 2, ... – all initially in the same state η. The
interaction between a system S and R is described in terms
of a sequence of collisions, each lasting a short time τ , be-
tween S and the nth ancella. Each collision is described by
a unitary operator ˆUSn = e−i ˆHSnτ where ˆHSn is the interac-
tion Hamiltonian. The Hilbert space dimension of both S
and a generic ancilla can be arbitrary. The initial - product
- state of S-R reads

σ0 = ρ0⊗η1⊗η2⊗ ...

(24)

Figure 1. (a) CM with internal memory:
inter-ancillary colli-
sions are interspersed with system-ancilla collisions. (b) Equiv-
alent Markovian collision model for S-M : only the auxiliary
system M undergoes successive interactions with the bath an-
cillas, which are interspersed with unitary S-M collisions.
In
the latter model no inter-ancillary collisions occur.

the inter-ancillary collision between ancillas n and n + 1
is modelled as a probabilistic swap operation, which is a
non-unitary process with an associated quantum map that
transforms the joint S-R state σ according to

K(n,n+1)

[σ] = qσ+p ˆSn,n+1σ ˆSn,n+1

(q = 1−p) ,

(26)

where ˆSi,j is the swap unitary operator exchanging the
states of ancillas i and j.
In other words, the states of

SUnn 1n1+......CM in Ref. [6]Equivalent CMtimeSKpnn 1n1+......SUnn 1n1+......SMK1 pnn 1n1+......USMnn 1n1+......SMK1 pnn 1n1+......the two involved ancillas are swapped with probability p or
left unchanged with probability q. We deﬁne as “step” the
product of an inter-ancillary and of the following system-
ancilla collisions. Besides introducing inter-ancillary col-
lisions, we also slightly generalise the initial state (24) as

σ0 = ρ0⊗ ¯η1⊗η2⊗η3⊗ ... ,

(27)

where the initial state of ancilla 1, ¯η1, is in general diﬀerent
from the common state of ancillas ηn = η with n≥ 2. The
reason for considering this more general state will become
clear later.

After the ﬁrst S-1 collision, the initial joint state σ0
[cf. Eq. (27)] is transformed into σ1 = ˆU†S1σ0 ˆU†S1. Next,
the inter-ancillary 1-2 collision occurs followed by the col-
lision S-2, which yields, at the end of the 2nd step, σ2 =
q( ˆUS2σ1 ˆU†S2) + p( ˆUS2 ˆS12σ1 ˆS12 ˆU†S2). This can equivalently
be expressed in the form

σ2 = q( ˆUS2σ1 ˆU†S2)+p ˆU 2

S2(ρ0⊗η1⊗ ¯η2⊗η3⊗ ...) ˆU†2

S2 , (28)

where in the second term we replaced σ1= ˆUS1σ0 ˆU†S1 and
used the identity ˆS12 ˆUS1= ˆUS2 ˆS12. Accordingly, the state
between brackets in the second term of Eq. (28) is the initial
state (27) where ancillas 1 and 2 have been swapped (note
that state ¯η is now the state of ancilla 2). By iteration (see
Appendix B), the state at the nth step will read

+ pn−1 ˆU n

Sn(ρ0⊗η1⊗ ... ⊗ ηn−1⊗ ¯ηn⊗ ηn+1⊗ ...) ˆU n†Sn.(29)
In the state between brackets in the second term, the nth
ancilla is in state ¯η, while all the remaining ones are in η.
Note that in Eq. (29) only the unitary operator ˆUSn asso-
ciated with the nth SA collision appears. This remarkable
property allows to write the corresponding equation for the
reduced S density operator ρn = TrRσn as

n−1(cid:88)

j=1

ρn = q

pj−1Ej[ρn−j]+pn−1Φn[ρ0] .

(30)

where [cf. Eqs. (7) and (8)] Ej ≡ E(jτ ) and Φj = Φ(jτ ).
Correspondingly, the variation of ρn between the (n−1)th
and nth steps, i.e., ∆ρn = (ρn−ρn−1), is given by

pj−1Ej[∆ρn−j]+q pn−1En−1[ρ1]+∆(cid:0)pn−1Φn

(cid:1)[ρ0].

n−2(cid:88)

∆ρn = q

j=1

In the continuous-time limit, Eq. (31) can be cast in the
form of an exact ME. In this limit nτ → t and jτ → t(cid:48)
so that pj = (p
, where the memory rate Γ is
deﬁned in terms of p [cf. Eq. (26)] and τ as

τ )jτ = e−Γt

(cid:48)

(31)

p = exp[−Γτ ] .

(32)

Furthermore, in the same limit, τ must be far shorter than
any characteristic time, in particular Γ−1. Hence, Γτ (cid:28) 1
and thus q = 1− p = 1− e−Γτ (cid:39) Γτ . When this is used in
Eq. (31), we end up with the memory-kernel ME (6) as we
show in detail in Appendix C.

This collision model generalizes the one in Ref. [6], the
latter being retrieved in the special case ¯η ≡ η. Such
an extension is indeed necessary to ensure that the closed
memory-kernel ME (6) corresponds to a bipartite ME for
S-M where the memory M is initially in an arbitrary state
¯η (see Section II). In the CM discussed above, this require-
ment simply translates into allowing the 1st and the re-
maining reservoir ancillas to be initially in diﬀerent states.

V. A MEMORYLESS COLLISION MODEL

We now show that, as anticipated in the introduction, our
memory-kernel ME can be derived by a second memoryless
CM describing a subsystem S coupled to a fully Markovian
environment via an auxiliary system M . In this CM the
reservoir R consists again of a large collection of identical
ancillas n = 1, 2, ..., which however are now non-interacting
(no inter-ancillary collisions occur). The “system” relaxing
into the reservoir R is now bipartite, with its subsystems
S and M mutually interacting according to a Hamiltonian
ˆHSM . By hypothesis, the Hibert-space dimensions of M
and each of the ancillas are assumed to be equal. The
initial S-M -R joint state is assumed to be

σ0 = [ρ0 ⊗ ¯ηM ] ⊗η1⊗η2 ⊗ ··· .

(33)

As the reservoir ancillas do not interact with each other
(in contrast to the CM of the previous section) here only
system-ancilla collisions take place. These collisions, which
we assume to involve only M (i.e., S is not in direct contact
with R) are described by the non-unitary probabilistic swap
K(M,n)
1−p . The deﬁnition of such a map, acting on M and the
nth ancilla, is the same as in Eq. (26) but the replacement
p→ 1−p (as highlighted by the subscript). In other words, at
each collision, either the current state of M is swapped with
the ancillary state η with probability 1−p or left unchanged
with probability p. In addition to such collisions a unitary
dynamics internal to the bipartite S-M system, generated
by the Hamiltonian ˆHSM , takes place. Such dynamics has
the form of S-M unitary collisions that are interspersed
with collisions between M and the reservoir ancillas. A
sketch of the CM dynamics is shown in Fig. 1(b). Note
that the joint S-M system undergoes a fully Markovian
dynamics (while in general this is not the case for S).

ˆSM n(ρSM ηn) ˆS†M n

It is convenient to deﬁne a map S on S-M as
= TrM{ρSM}ηM , (34)
S(ρSM ) = Trn
which describes how an arbitrary S-M state ρSM is changed
after that a (unitary) swap operation is applied on M and
a generic ancilla initially in state η (we recall that this has
the same dimension as M ). A proof of the last identity

(cid:110)

(cid:111)

in Eq. (34) is given in Appendix D. Using Eq. (34), from
Eq. (26) we get

that, unlike here, the system-ancilla collisions are unitary).
At step n, the S-M joint state is

where p is given by Eq. (32) and we have replaced the

In the continuous-time limit [see also the discussion fol-
lowing Eq. (32)], τ (cid:39) 0 in a way that p(cid:39) 1−Γτ and q(cid:39) Γτ .
Hence, up to ﬁrst order in τ, e−i ˆHSM τ ρ(n−1)

tained [see second line of Eq. (39)] under the replacement

In the continuos-time limit, ∆ρ(n)

and the last identity in Eq. (34) we thus end up with ME
(1) [we recall that the Lindbladian LM deﬁned by Eq. (5)
can be equivalently expressed in the form (12)].
We conclude by pointing out that upon decomposition
of the ancillary state ηn in its eigenstates [see Eq. (4) for
M → n] the partial trace in Eq. (40) can be expressed as
(cid:88)
n(cid:104)µ| ˆSMn ρ(n−1)

where { ˆLµν} indeed coincide with the jump operators (5).
This illustrates that the form of the Lindbladian LM intro-
duced in Section II can be interpreted as stemming from
swap-like interactions between M and the reservoir R.

Note that the above can be regarded as an “indirect”
demonstration of the fact that ME (6) arises from ME (1)
upon trace over M .

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we addressed the problem of an open quan-
tum system S coherently coupled to a memory M , which
in turn is in contact with a Markovian bath, the bipartite
S-M system being governed by a Lindblad-type ME. In
contrast to the typical case where tracing out the degrees
of freedom of M does not yield a closed ME, we have found
a class of MEs of the above form where this partial trace
does give rise to a closed, exact ME for S. This can be
viewed as a generalisation of a ME originally derived via a
CM. This lead us to interpret the link between the memory-
kernel ME for S and the S-M Lindbladian ME in terms of
suitably deﬁned CMs, hence providing in fact a comprehen-
sive microscopic framework underlying our central result.

(38)

Upon trace over M , recalling the deﬁnition of maps E(t)
and Φ(t) [cf. Eqs. (7) and (8)], we thus end up with Eq. (30).
This shows that, as far as the reduced dynamics of S is
concerned, the present CM, in which the joint S-M sys-
tem undergoes incoherent binary collisions between M and
each of the non-interacting ancillas of an inﬁnitely large
reservoir interspersed with “internal” S-M coherent uni-
tary collisions, is equivalent to the discrete CM described
in Section V.

Microscopic derivation of Master Equation (1)

We now show that, in the continuous-time limit, the bi-
partite CM discussed above gives rise to ME (1). To this
end, we use an approach similar to the one adopted for
composite CMs [19] (these diﬀer from the present CM in

6

In particular, we have shown that our ME can be derived
as the continuous-time limit of two distinct collision models
each describing a diﬀerent physical scenario.

We note (see also footnote [4]) that in the case of the
dissipative Jaynes-Cummins model, which is also governed
by a bipartite Lindbladian ME where an atom (mode) em-
bodies S (M ), it is known that a reduced ME for the atom
can be obtained [1] but this is in fact formulated in terms of
its solution (as if it were a priori known), at variance with
our case. One could object that even the memory-kernel
ME (6) is expressed in terms of maps E(t) and Φ(t), which
are assumed to be known. Note, though, that these can be
regarded as the solutions of the problem (for two diﬀerent
initial conditions) where S and M undergo a joint unitary
evolution, fully dependent on their total Hamiltonian ˆHSM ,
and one aims at working out the corresponding dynamical
map of S. Such a problem is often amenable to analytical
solution.

We also comment on the relationship with the ME in
Ref. [6] and, accordingly, the associated CM. In the case
E(t)≡ Φ(t), ηM would coincide with ¯ηM . This would bring
about that, for a given Lindbladian (2) speciﬁed by the
jump operators (5), there would be only a single possible
initial state ¯ηM of M such that the partial trace of ME
(1) leads to ME (6). Alternatively, given an arbitrary M
initial state ¯ηm, only the Lindbladian speciﬁed by the jump
operators (5) with ηM ≡ ¯ηM would entail Eq. (6) for S.
Instead, the presence of the two maps E(t) and Φ(t) in
ME (6) ensures the existence of a class of bipartite MEs
such that, for any element of this, the partial trace over M
leads to ME (6) for any initial state of M entering Eq. (3).
Furthermore, it is easy to show [21] that, as mentioned in
the Introduction, the suﬃcient conditions found in Ref. [5]
for a well-behaved Nakajima-Zwanzig ME are satisﬁed in
our case Eq. (6).

The special property of the class of MEs speciﬁed by
Lindbladian (5), which enables to work out a closed ME for
S, is that the M -reservoir coupling is based on swap-like
interactions (the properties of the swap operator somehow
enters all of our proofs). While this is a peculiar model,
yet not academic [see Eq. (10)], we envisage that it can be
exploited as an advantageous theoretical testbed for inves-
tigating quantum non-Markovianity concepts.

Appendix A: Laplace transform of master equation (6)

Here, we derive the solution of ME (6) in the Laplace
space. The proof is based on calculations that are similar
to those in Ref. [6, 20]. Let Λ(t) be the dynamical map
describing the non-unitary dynamics of S corresponding to

ME (6) according to ρ(t) = Λ(t)[ρ0] with Λ(0) = IS. Map
Λ(t) obeys Eq. (6) under the formal replacement ρ → Λ.
Indeed, replacing ρ(t) = Λ(t)[ρ0] in (6) and using that ρ0
is arbitrary, we ﬁnd that Λ(t) is governed by the equation

Upon LT, the equation becomes

˜Λ(s) = Γ ˜E(s + Γ)˜Λ(s) + ˜Φ(s + Γ)

where for s complex the LT is deﬁned as

˜F (s) = L [F (t)](s) =

and introducing the inverse of map I−Γ ˜E(s + Γ) we end
up with [cf. Eq. (23)]

˜Λ(s) =

The integrand in Eq. (A9) is evidently a composition of
CPTP quantum maps, hence it is CPTP itself [we recall
that both E(t) and Φ(t) are CPTP maps, see Eqs. (7) and
(8)]. Therefore, we see that the dynamical map Eq. (A8) is
in fact a combination of CPTP maps with positive weights.
This proves that the dynamical map Λ(t) corresponding to
ME (6) is completely positive and trace preserving.

Eq. (29) thus holds for n ≤ 3. To prove that it is valid

[4] It is known that in such a case one can work out a closed
ME for the atom with time-dependent rates [1]. These how-
ever depend on the time-evolved excitation probability am-
plitude of the atom, which in fact speciﬁes the atom’s full
dynamical map [1]. In other words, this ME is closed but
expressed in terms of its solution. Here, by “closed ME” we
mean one that does not depend on its solution.

[21] By comparing Eq. (A6) and Eq. (9) of Ref. [5], we can
identity the pair of “legitimate” CP maps N (t) = e−ΓtΦ(t),
Q(t) = Γe−ΓtE(t) which, as required in Ref. [5], indeed fulﬁl
Tr{Q(t)[ρ] + ∂tTr{N (t)[ρ]} = 0 for any state ρ.
