ABSTRACT

The recently discovered rotationally powered pulsar PSR J1640–4631 is the ﬁrst to have a braking
index measured, with high enough precision, that is greater than three. An inclined magnetic rotator
in vacuum or plasma would be subject not only to spin-down but also to an alignment torque. The
vacuum model can address the braking index only for an almost orthogonal rotator that is incompatible
with the single peaked pulse proﬁle. The magnetic dipole model with the corotating plasma predicts
braking indices between 3 − 3.25. We ﬁnd that the braking index of 3.15 is consistent with two
diﬀerent inclination angles, 18.5 ± 3 degrees and 56 ± 4 degrees. The smaller angle is preferred given
the pulse proﬁle has a single peak and the radio output of the source is weak. We infer the change
in the inclination angle to be at the rate −0.23 degrees per century, three times smaller in absolute
value than the rate recently observed for the Crab pulsar.

1. INTRODUCTION

alignment components respectively given as

The rotationally powered pulsar PSR J1640–4631 re-
cently discovered by NuSTAR in X-rays may be hold-
ing a clue about the origins of pulsar spin down.
PSR J1640–4631 has a spin frequency of ν = 4.843 Hz
˙ν = −2.28 × 10−11 s−2
and a spin-down rate of
(Archibald et al. 2016) implying a characteristic age
of τc ≡ −ν/2 ˙ν = 3370 years and spin-down power of
5.5 × 1036 erg s−1.
Interestingly, it is the ﬁrst pulsar
to have a braking index (i.e., n ≡ ν ¨ν/ ˙ν2) greater than
three, n = 3.15± 0.03 (Archibald et al. 2016), measured
with high precision. This is unusual given the previ-
ous measurements (Lyne et al. 1993; Livingstone et al.
2007; Lyne et al. 1996; Espinoza et al. 2011; Livingstone
& Kaspi 2011; Roy et al. 2012; Antonopoulou et al. 2015;
Archibald et al. 2015; Ferdman et al. 2015) for 8 other
pulsars with braking indices n < 3 (see Lyne et al. 2015,
for a compilation).

A dipole rotating in vacuum is subject to magnetic

where Ω = 2πν is the angular velocity and µ is the
magnetic moment of the star, α is the inclination angle
between rotation and magnetic axis and c is the speed
of light. This model predicts a braking index of

n = 3 + 2 cot2 α

(3)

(Michel & Goldwire 1970; Davis & Goldstein 1970)
which is always greater than 3 and diverges for small
inclination angles. Such a model predicts rapid align-
ment within a spin-down time-scale. According to this
vacuum magnetic dipole model a pulsar would stop spin-
ning down when alignment is achieved in obvious contra-
diction with observations. It was suggested by Goldreich
(1970) that the progress of alignment would be slowed
down by dissipative processes for a non-spherical pulsar.
Therefore, the eﬀect of the alignment torque given in

2

Equation 2 has not been adequately appreciated in the
literature. As a result it has been rarely used together
with the spin-down torque given in Equation 1 although
the alignment torque is an intrinsic component of the
torque due to the magnetic dipole.

The recent observational evidence suggesting an in-
creasing inclination angle of the Crab pulsar (Lyne et al.
2013) (see also Ge et al. (2016)) implies that the mag-
netospheric torques can dominate the dissipative pro-
cesses invoked by Goldreich (1970). Yet the increasing
inclination angle of Crab pulsar may require a further
ingredient such as the presence of return currents in
the magnetosphere (Beskin & Nokhrina 2007) or pre-
cession (Arzamasskiy et al. 2015; Zanazzi & Lai 2015).
But an orthogonal rotator with plasma-ﬁlled force-free
magnetosphere (Philippov et al. 2014) requires a much
larger current than used in Beskin & Nokhrina (2007) so
that the minimum spin-down energy losses correspond
to that of an aligned rotator in the end. There is also
statistical evidence that the inclination angle of pulsars
tend to achieve alignment in the long term (Young et al.
2010; Lyne & Manchester 1988).

The pulsar is unlikely to be rotating in vacuum; its
magnetosphere is expected to be ﬁlled by a corotat-
ing plasma formed through charged particles ripped oﬀ
from the surface of the neutron star (Goldreich & Ju-
lian 1969) and thereafter accelerated by rotation induced
electric ﬁeld along curved magnetic ﬁeld lines to give an
excess of electron–positron pair discharges (Philippov
& Spitkovsky 2014). As shown by recent simulations
(Chen & Beloborodov 2014; Philippov et al. 2015) only
such a conﬁguration is capable of maintaining a pulsar
active. The spin-down (Spitkovsky 2006) and alignment
(Philippov et al. 2014) torques in the presence of a coro-
tating plasma also predict alignment, but at a slower
pace compared to that of the vacuum model. More-
over, the model predicts a braking index of n = 3− 3.25
depending on the inclination angle (Arzamasskiy et al.
2015). This obviates any necessity to invoke other as-
sumptions to address the measured braking index of
PSR J1640–4631, n = 3.15±0.03 (Archibald et al. 2016).
We show within the framework of the plasma-ﬁlled
magnetosphere model that there are two possible solu-
tions for the inclination angle of PSR J1640–4631. We
infer the magnetic dipole moment and rate of change
of the inclination angle of the pulsar, and provide the
implications on the evolution of pulsars on the P − ˙P -
diagram. In § 2 we describe the model details and its
consequences. In § 3 we discuss the results in view of
less-than-three braking indices.

2. EVOLUTION OF PULSARS WITH PLASMA

FILLED MAGNETOSPHERES

Figure 1. The braking index versus the inclination angle for
the pulsars. The solid line (red in the electronic version)
stands for the prediction of the plasma ﬁlled magnetosphere
model given in Equation 8; the long-dashed line (blue in the
electronic version) stands for the prediction of the vacuum
model given in Equation 3. The horizontal short-dashed line
(black) and the surrounding shaded region denote, respec-
tively, the measured braking index of n = 3.15 and its possi-
ble range given by the uncertainty 0.03 for the PSR J1640–
4631.

Although these equations seem to be only slightly dif-
ferent than the equations of the vacuum model given in
Equation 1 and Equation 2, they predict a slower align-
ment (Philippov et al. 2014) and imply the spin-down of
the pulsar even when alignment is achieved as originally
predicted by Goldreich & Julian (1969).

Using only Equation 4, the braking index in this model

is

where

Using Equation 5 in Equation 6 the braking index can
be calculated as

n = 3 + 2u2

(8)

(Arzamasskiy et al. 2015) which implies 3 < n < 3.25
depending on the inclination angle and does not diverge
as its vacuum counterpart for small inclination angles.
In Figure 1 we show this prediction of the plasma-ﬁlled
magnetosphere model (Spitkovsky 2006; Philippov et al.

33.053.13.153.23.253.30102030405060708090nα(degrees)plasma-lledvacuum2014) together with that of the vacuum model (Michel &
Goldwire 1970; Davis & Goldstein 1970) given in Equa-
tion 3. Accordingly, the plasma-ﬁlled model can ex-
plain the braking index of 3.15 ± 0.03 observed from
PSR J1640–4631 (Archibald et al. 2016) for two diﬀer-
ent inclination angles, 18.5±3 degrees and 56±4 degrees.
Of these we favour the smaller value as the pulse proﬁle
shows a single peak (Archibald et al. 2016).

From the measured braking index of PSR J1640–4631
(Archibald et al. 2016) by using Equation 8 we ﬁnd

u = (cid:112)(n − 3)/2 = 0.274 ± 0.025. Using this result in

Equation 6 the rate of decrease of the inclination angle
can be found as

˙α = −(0.23 ± 0.05)◦ century−1.

(9)

This value is about three times smaller (in absolute
value) than the measured increasing inclination angle
of the Crab pulsar (Lyne et al. 2013).

By dividing Equation 4 with Equation 5 and upon in-
tegration one ﬁnds cos2 α/P sin α is a constant through-
out the evolution of the pulsar (Philippov et al. 2014);
as P = 2π/Ω increases cos2 α/ sin α should also increase
which is achieved for small values of α. Thus we deﬁne

A ≡ cos2 α0
P0 sin α0

=

cos2 α
P sin α

(10)

where P0 is the initial spin period and α0 is the initial
inclination angle. For P = 0.2065 s and α = 18.5◦ we
ﬁnd A = 13.72 for this pulsar. Solving sin α from the
above equation gives

sin α =

Accordingly the period derivative is related to the period

where sin α is from Equation 11 and A is from Equa-
tion 10. We infer the magnetic dipole moment of the
pulsar in units of 1030 G cm3 as µ30 = 11.2 from the
measured spin frequency and its derivative from Equa-
tion 4 employing α = 18.5◦ and I = 1045 g cm2. The
position of the pulsar is shown in the P − ˙P -diagram in
Figure 2.

3. DISCUSSION

We have shown that the greater-than-three braking
index of the recently discovered pulsar PSR J1640–
4631 (Archibald et al. 2016) is readily explained by the
plasma-ﬁlled magnetic dipole model (Goldreich & Ju-
lian 1969; Spitkovsky 2006; Philippov et al. 2014; Arza-
masskiy et al. 2015). The only free parameter of the
model is the inclination angle and there are two possi-
ble solutions; 18.5 ± 3 degrees and 56 ± 4 degrees. The

3

smaller inclination angle is favoured because of the single
peak in the pulse proﬁle (Rankin 1983, 1990; Weltevrede
& Johnston 2008; Hankins & Rankin 2010). The rela-
tively small radio output of this object, with an upper
limit of 0.018 mJy at 1.4 GHz (Archibald et al. 2016)
may also be a consequence of this small inclination angle
of the pulsar.
Note that

the vacuum model as employed by
Archibald et al. (2016) and also seen in Figure 1 predicts
an almost orthogonal rotator. As this is not compati-
ble with the single peaked pulse proﬁle, Archibald et al.
(2016) disfavoured the idea that the alignment of the ro-
tation and magnetic axes, i.e. decrement in the inclina-
tion angle, is the cause of the greater-than-three brak-
ing index of PSR J1640–4631 and suggested that the
quadrupole magnetic moment of this object could be im-
portant. The model with plasma-ﬁlled magnetosphere,
on the other hand does not require an orthogonal rotator
to produce the observed braking index of PSR J1640–
4631 as seen in Figure 1. Given that the presence of
the charged particles around pulsars is well established
(see e.g. Goldreich & Julian 1969) we conclude that
the evolution of the inclination angle of PSR J1640–
4631 towards an aligned rotator, within the framework
of plasma-ﬁlled magnetosphere model (Spitkovsky 2006;
Philippov et al. 2014), is a simpler and better under-
stood explanation of the observed greater-than-three
braking index.

Another possibility for explaining the greater-than-
three braking index could be an anomalous ¨ν result-
ing from a glitch (Alpar & Baykal 2006). We note that
n = 3.15±0.03 is not an anomalous braking index within
the framework of the plasma-ﬁlled magnetosphere model
(Arzamasskiy et al. 2015).

Archibald et al. (2016) favours the quadrupole struc-
ture of the magnetosphere (P´etri 2015) for explaining
the greater-than-three braking index of PSR J1640–
4631. We show here that this process alone, with no
assistance from the alignment torque, would require very
strong quadrupole ﬁelds to increase n up to 3.15. In this
case the spin-down luminosity due to the quadrupole
ﬁeld has to be (n − 3)/(5 − n) (cid:39) 10% of the dipole
spin-down luminosity. This implies the Poynting ﬂux of
the quadrupole ﬁeld to be 10% of that of the dipole
√
ﬁeld. This then requires the quadrupole ﬁeld to be
0.1 (cid:39) 0.3 times the dipole ﬁeld at the light cylin-
der, RL = c/Ω (cid:39) 109 cm. Assuming a stellar radius
of R∗ = 106 cm this implies a quadrupole ﬁeld ∼ 300
times stronger than the dipole ﬁeld! Given that the
dipole ﬁeld at the equator is Bd = µ/R3 (cid:39) 1013 G, we
infer a quadrupole ﬁeld of Bq (cid:39) 3 × 1015 G for this
object. The radio polarimetry measurements, for nor-
mal pulsars, indicate that the ﬁeld is of dipolar form
at heights (cid:46) 30R∗ where radio emission is generated

Magnetars are shown with triangles (red in the electronic version), X-ray dim neutron stars (XDINS) are shown with solid

involving each equi-magnetic ﬁeld line are the envelopes of them for the full inclination angle range. Equi-characteristic age
lines are also shown (dark blue in the electronic version). The data is taken from ATNF pulsar catalogue at URL http:

(Karastergiou & Johnston 2007). Hence such a discrep-
ancy between the dipole and quadrupole ﬁelds at the
surface is unusual for normal pulsars. Yet we can not
exclude the possibility that PSR J1640–4631 has super-
strong quadrupole ﬁelds unlike that of ordinary pulsars.
Presence of such super-strong quadrupole ﬁelds would
render the object similar to the ∼ 800 year old pul-
sar PSR J1846-0258 located in Kesteven 75 supernova
remnant (Gotthelf et al. 2000) which emitted several
magnetar-like bursts (Gavriil et al. 2008). The dipole
ﬁeld of PSR J1846-0258 is about 5 × 1013 G i.e. 5 times
stronger than that of PSR J1640–4631, and is marginally
beyond the quantum-critical limit, Bq = 4.4×1013 G. If
PSR J1640–4631 also has such strong quadrupole ﬁelds
near the surface it may be expected to show magnetar-
like bursts likely associated with some glitch activity in
the future. Such pulsars with super-strong quadrupole
ﬁelds may be another manifestation of low-B magnetars
(Rea et al. 2010) as argued by Perna & Pons (2011).

Given the measured greater-than-three braking index
of PSR J1640–4631 can be addressed by employing the

conventional view of a pulsar with corotating magne-
tosphere, the question naturally arises why most other
measured braking indices are less than three. Many dif-
ferent models have been suggested to explain the less-
than-three braking indices: Some models invoke an ex-
ternal torque similar to that from stellar winds (e.g. Ou
et al. 2016) or from a putative fallback disk (e.g. Michel
& Dessler 1981; Menou et al. 2001; ¨Ozs¨ukan et al. 2014).
Some others modify the magnetic dipole model by sug-
gesting that the magnetic dipole ﬁelds are increasing
(Blandford & Romani 1988) e.g. due to diﬀusion ensu-
ing post-supernova ﬁeld burial by accreted matter (e.g.
Geppert et al. 1999; Espinoza et al. 2011; G¨uneyda¸s &
Ek¸si 2013; Ho 2015) or by poloidal ﬁeld growth at the ex-
pense of interior toroidal ﬁeld decay through Hall eﬀect
(Gourgouliatos & Cumming 2015). Another interesting
suggestion is the increasing inclination angles of pulsars
are increasing in the long term (Beskin et al. 1984) as
possibly observed in the Crab pulsar (Lyne et al. 2013).
Yet the latter observation might result from precession
(Zanazzi & Lai 2015; Arzamasskiy et al. 2015). Yet an-

ﬁnite size eﬀects for the dipole given the presence of a
corotating plasma (Melatos 1997).

We showed that a magnetic dipole within a plasma
ﬁlled magnetosphere does produce greater-than-three
braking indices. Therefore,
invoking a combination
of mechanisms (e.g. wind and magnetic quadrupole
moments assisting the plasma ﬁlled magnetosphere)
appears unnecessary to explain the braking index of
PSR J1640–4631.
It is particularly unclear how these
physical mechanism aﬀect the inclination angle.

Any process that could potentially account for the
less- than-three braking index should start reducing the

5
the braking index from higher values (i.e. n = 3 − 3.25
as predicted by Arzamasskiy et al. (2015)) rather than
the canonical value n = 3 assumed by neglecting the
alignment torque.
