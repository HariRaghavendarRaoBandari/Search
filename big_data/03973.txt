BOUNDED SOLUTIONS TO NONLINEAR PROBLEMS IN RN

INVOLVING THE FRACTIONAL LAPLACIAN DEPENDING ON

PARAMETERS

SAID EL MANOUNI, HICHEM HAJAIEJ, AND PATRICK WINKERT

Abstract. The main goal of this paper is the study of two kinds of nonlinear
problems depending on parameters in unbounded domains. Using a nonstan-
dard variational approach, we ﬁrst prove the existence of bounded solutions for
nonlinear eigenvalue problems involving the fractional Laplace operator (−∆)s
and nonlinearities that have subcritical growth. In the second part, based on
a variational principle of Ricceri [16], we study a fractional nonlinear problem
with two parameters and prove the existence of multiple solutions.

In this paper, we are interested in the study of two nonlocal problems involving
an integro-diﬀerential operator of fractional type. More precisely, the fractional
Laplacian in RN as a nonlocal generalization of the Laplace operator denoted by
(−∆)s and deﬁned pointwise for x ∈ RN up to normalization factors by

u(x + y) + u(x − y) − 2u(x)

dy,

(1.1)

takes center in our considerations in terms of two nonlocal problems involving
one, respectively two positive parameters. Let us mention that in recent years much
attention has been devoted to the study of nonlocal problems of elliptic type and
a lot of papers have appeared both in bounded and unbounded domains, see, for
example Autuori-Pucci [1], Molica Bisci [14], Molica Bisci-R˘adulescu [15], Lehrer-
Maia-Squassina [?], Servadei-Valdinoci [19] the references therein.

Nonlocal operators such as (−∆)s naturally arise in a quite natural way in many
diﬀerent contexts, both for pure mathematical research and in view of concrete real-
world applications, such as, for instance, the thin obstacle problem, optimization,
ﬁnance, phase transitions phenomena, stratiﬁed materials, anomalous diﬀusion,
population dynamics and game theory, ﬂame propagation, conservation laws, con-
tinuum mechanics, quasi-geostrophic ﬂows, multiple scattering, minimal surfaces,
etc. For more details, we refer to Caﬀarelli [5], Caﬀarelli-Vazquez [6], Chang-Wang
[7], Cheng [8], Felmer-Quaas-Tan [11], Hajaiej [12], Tan-Wang-Yang [20] and the
references therein.

Dealing with such nonlocal problems involving (−∆)s operator requires a partic-
ular functional framework. We refer the reader to Di Nezza-Palatucci-Valdinoci [10]
and to the references included for a selfcontained overview of the basic properties
of fractional Sobolev spaces.

S. EL MANOUNI, H. HAJAIEJ, AND P. WINKERT

The purpose of this paper is the study of two nonlocal problems by using two
diﬀerent approaches. In the ﬁrst part, we consider the eigenvalue problem for the
fractional Laplacian in RN and using a nonstandard variational procedure we show
the existence of at least one solution corresponding to some positive parameter.
Additionally, we establish some regularity results for the solution obtaind in terms
of global L∞-estimates by constructing an iteration scheme to bound the maximal
norm of the solution following Moser’s iteration (see, for example Dr´abek-Kufner-
Nicolosi [9]). The second part concerns a nonlinear problem with two parameters
involving the fractional Laplacian. The existence and multiplicity results are proved
by applying a variational principle of Ricceri [16]. Let us note that since the appear-
ance of the abstract result proved by Ricceri in [18] and its revisited note established
in [17] dealing with variational equations in both local and nonlocal settings, they
have been widely investigated and have intensively been applied for the study of
the existence of multiple nontrivial solutions and in recent years a lot of papers has
been appeared in the scalar case and systems of elliptic equations. In [16], Ricceri
obtained a general three critical points theorem, that has been applied for a class
of local integro-diﬀerential equations involving a large class of nonlinearities. We
will not mention such applications here since the reader can easily access to such
literature in this regard. In our context, we are interested in a class of nonlocal
integro-diﬀerential equations involving two parameters and nonlinearities with sub-
critical growth in RN and prove multiple nontrivial solutions by making use of the
variational principle of Ricceri [16].

2. Preliminaries

Throughout this paper and before deﬁning the natural framework for such two
nonlocal problems involving the fractional Laplace operator (1.1), namely, a frac-

continuous derivatives of arbitrary order.

tional Sobolev-type space, we will denote by k · kp the Lebesgue norm in Lp(cid:0)RN(cid:1)
and C∞0 (cid:0)RN(cid:1) will be the space of all functions with compact support in RN with
Let us introduce the function space Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1) as the completion of C∞0 (RN ) with

It can be shown that

Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1) =(cid:26)u ∈ L2∗s(cid:0)RN(cid:1) : |u(x) − u(y)|

|x − y|N/2+s ∈ L2(cid:0)RN × RN(cid:1)(cid:27)
for all u ∈ Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1) ,
(2.1)
where 2∗s = 2N
(N−2s) , cf. Maz′ya-Shaposhnikova [13, Theo-
rem 1] (see also Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu [2, Theorem 1]). Moreover, the space

Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1) is a reﬂexive Banach space continuously embedded into L2∗s(cid:0)RN(cid:1).

The following two lemmas will be used in later considerations, see Brasco-Parini

[3, Lemmas A.1 and A.2].

Lemma 2.1. Let 1 < p < ∞ and f : R → R be a convex function, then
|a − b|p−2(a − b)(cid:2)A|f′(a)|p−2f′(a) − B|f′(b)|p−2f′(b)(cid:3)

The subsequent Lemma can be found in Autuori-Pucci [1].

Lemma 2.3. For any R > 0 and p ∈ [1, 2∗s) the embedding Ds(BR) ֒→ Lp(BR) is
compact, where BR denotes the ball in RN of center zero and radius R > 0.

Now, let X be a real Banach space. We denote by WX the class of all functionals
Φ : X → R possessing the following property:
if (un)n≥1 is a sequence in X
converging weakly to u ∈ X and lim inf n→∞ Φ(un) ≤ Φ(u), then (un)n≥1 has a
subsequence converging strongly to u.
The following abstract critical point theorem is due to Ricceri [16, Theorem 2].
Theorem 2.4. Let X be a separable and reﬂexive real Banach space, Φ : X → R
is a coercive, sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous C1-functional belonging to
WX which is bounded on each bounded subset of X and whose derivative admits
a continuous inverse on X∗ and J : X → R is a C1-functional with compact
derivative. Assume that Φ has a strict local minimum x0 with Φ(x0) = J(x0) = 0.

3. A nonlinear eigenvalue problem

parameter λ > 0

(−∆)su = λw(x)|u|q−2u in RN ,

(3.1)
where 0 < s < 1, 2s < N, 2 < q < 2∗s and (−∆)s is the fractional Laplace operator
given in (1.1). We suppose the following assumptions on the indeﬁnite weight
function w : RN → R.
(W1) there exists an open subset Ω 6= ∅ of RN such that w(x) > 0 a.e. in Ω;

The next result gives, in particular, the boundedness of weak solutions to (3.1).
Theorem 3.3. Under the assumptions of Theorem 3.2, every weak solution u ∈
Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1) satisﬁes u ∈ Lκ(cid:0)RN(cid:1) for any κ ∈ [2∗s,∞].
Proof. For every 0 < ε ≪ 1, we deﬁne the smooth convex Lipschitz function

fε(t) = (ε2 + t2)

Taking ϕ = ψf′ε(u) as test function in (3.2) with ψ ∈ C∞0 (cid:0)RN(cid:1) being a positive

dxdy ≤ λZRN |w||u|q−1ψ|f′ε| dx.

For M > 0, we deﬁne the cutoﬀ function uM (x) = inf{u(x), M} of u. Then,

One can prove that similar assertions as stated in Theorems 3.2 and 3.3 remain
true concerning problem (3.13) by the use of the same approach and arguments
similar to those used in their proofs.

Remark 3.6. Another generalization of problem (3.1) that is of interest can be
given when (−∆)s is replaced by any nonlocal integro-diﬀerential operator
[u(x + y) + u(x − y) − 2u(x)]K(y) dy x ∈ RN ,

along any rapidly decaying function u of class C∞(cid:0)RN(cid:1), where the positive weight
K : RN\{0} → R+ satisﬁes the following properties:
(K1) νK ∈ L1(cid:0)RN(cid:1) with ν(x) = min(|x|2, 1);
(K2) there exists Γ > 0 such that K(x) ≥ Γ|x|−(N +2s) for any x ∈ RN\{0};
(K3) K(x) = K(−x) for any x ∈ RN\{0}.
In particular, when the kernel K is given by K(x) = |x|−(N +2s), LK coincides with
the fractional Laplace operator (−∆)s.
If 2s < N (where s ∈ (0, 1)), then under an adequate functional framework and
suitable conditions on the right-hand side term, the assertion of Theorems 3.2 and
3.3 should be a generalization of previous results.

4. Nonlinear problems with two parameters

We consider the following nonlinear problem with two parameters

(4.1)
where 0 < s < 1, 2s < N , 2 < q < min(r, 2∗s), λ, µ > 0 are real parameters,
f, g : RN × R → R are two nonlinearities that have subcritical growth with respect

(−∆)su = λf (x, u) + µg(x, u)

precise, we assume that f and g are Carath´eodory functions satisfying the following
conditions.

such that h ∈ L
or |g(x, t)| ≤ h(x)|t|2∗s−1 for a.a. x ∈ RN and for all t ∈ R with h ∈ L∞(cid:0)RN(cid:1)

to problem (4.1).

Now we state our main result of this section about the multiplicity of solutions

suppose, for 1 < τ < 2 and some positive function ρ ∈ L

norms are less than r1.

is well deﬁned and coercive. By Lemma 3.2 of Autuori-Pucci [1] we know that Φ is

continuous, Gˆateaux diﬀerentiable and belongs to C1((cid:0)Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1) , R(cid:1) with

[u(x) − u(y)][ϕ(x) − ϕ(y)]

dxdy,

hΦ′(u), ϕi =ZZR2N

|x − y|N +2s

by using Theorem 26.A of Zeidler [21], we deduce that Φ′ admits a continuous

for all u, ϕ ∈ Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1). Moreover, Φ is weakly lower semicontinuous by Corollary 3.9
of Brezis [4] and it is clearly bounded on each bounded subset of Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1). Finally,
inverse on (cid:0)Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1)(cid:1)∗. This implies that Φ ∈ WDs(RN ). We deﬁne the functional
J : Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1) → R by

J(u) =ZRN

F (x, u) dx.

From (F) it follows that

|F (x, t)| ≤

q

m(x)|u|q

for a.a. x ∈ RN and for all t ∈ R.

Then, by standard argument, F is in C1(cid:0)RN × R(cid:1), hence we see that J is well

deﬁned and continuously Gˆateaux diﬀerentiable with

J ′(u)v =ZRN

f (x, u)v dx for all u, v ∈ Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1) .

Let us prove that J′ is a compact map from Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1) to (Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1))∗. Indeed,
let (uk)k≥1 be a sequence in Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1) which converges weakly to u. On one hand,

in view of H¨older’s inequality, (2.1) and since

Z|x|<Rε

f θ1(x, uk) dx →Z|x|<Rε

This implies that f θ1(x, uk) converges to f θ1(x, u) in L1(Bε). Taking L2∗s (Bε) ⊂
Lθ′1(Bε) into account, we get that f (x, uk)v converges to f (x, u)v in L1(Bε), that
is

Z|x|<Rε

(f (x, uk) − f (x, u))v dx → 0,

(4.6)

for all v ∈ Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1). Finally, in view of (4.5) and (4.6), there holds

Therefore J′ is a compact operator.

Now the proof of Theorem 4.1 will be accomplished by applying Theorem 2.4.
Indeed all the assumptions of Theorem 2.4 are satisﬁed with α = 0 and β = 1
θ ,
where θ is as in (4.4) and choose [a, b] ⊆]θ, +∞[. Moreover, the functional

Ψ(u) =

1

r ZRN

h(x)|u|r dx

is well deﬁned and continuously Gˆateaux diﬀerentiable in Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1) and one has

Ψ′(u)ϕ =ZRN

h(x)|u|r−2uϕ dx for all u, ϕ ∈ Ds(cid:0)RN(cid:1) .

As shown for J, we can prove in the same way that Ψ′ is compact. Therefore, there
exists r > 0 such that for every λ ∈ [a, b] we can ﬁnd σ > 0 verifying the following
condition: for each µ ∈ [0, σ], the functional Φ− λJ − µΨ has at least three critical
points, which are precisely weak solutions of problem (4.1) whose norms are less
than r. This yields the assertion of the theorem.
(cid:3)

Proposition 4.2. Let the assumptions of Theorem 4.1 be satisﬁed. Then, for any

solution u of problem (4.1) there holds u ∈ Lσ(cid:0)RN(cid:1) for all 2∗s ≤ σ ≤ ∞.

The proof follows by adapting the same iteration scheme as in the proof of The-
orem 3.3. Few details, due the condition assumed on h, may be given to bound the
maximal norm of solutions.

Remark 4.3.

(i) Let us remark that in the proof of Theorem 4.1, the choice of the values of the
positive constant δ does not aﬀect on the condition imposed on the function f .
(ii) Problems like (4.1) can be generalized for a more general class of fractional
operators. Namely, by considering problems driven from the fractional p-
Laplacian deﬁned in Remark 3.5, the assertion in Theorem 4.1 holds true
under some suitable conditions and variational setting.
