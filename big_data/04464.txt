Abstract

The data collected by the LHC collaborations at an energy of 13 TeV indicates the
presence of an excess in the diphoton spectrum that would correspond to a resonance
of a 750 GeV mass. The apparently large production cross section is nevertheless very
diﬃcult to explain in minimal models. We consider the possibility that the resonance
is a pseudoscalar boson A with a two–photon decay mediated by a charged and un-
colored fermion having a mass at the 1
2 MA threshold and a very small decay width,
(cid:28) 1 MeV; one can then generate a large enhancement of the Aγγ amplitude which
explains the excess without invoking a large multiplicity of particles propagating in the
loop, large electric charges and/or very strong Yukawa couplings. The implications of
such a threshold enhancement are discussed in two explicit scenarios: i) the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model in which the A state is produced via the top quark
mediated gluon fusion process and decays into photons predominantly through loops
of charginos with masses close to 1
2 MA and ii) a two Higgs doublet model in which A
is again produced by gluon fusion but decays into photons through loops of vector–like
charged heavy leptons. We also comment on a minimal scenario in which the A state
couples only to photons through a heavy lepton loop and is both produced and decays
through this coupling. In all these scenarios, while the mass of the charged fermion
has to be adjusted to be extremely close to half of the A resonance mass, the small
total widths are naturally obtained if only suppressed three-body decay channels occur.
Finally, the implications of some of these scenarios for dark matter are discussed.

1. Introduction

There is presently considerable excitement in the particle physics community as the ATLAS
and CMS collaborations have reported an excess in the data collected from LHC collisions
at an energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to a possible resonance with a mass of 750 GeV
decaying into two photons [1]. Assuming the resonance to be a scalar boson denoted Φ, the
production cross section times the decay branching ratio for the ﬁnal state pp → Φ → γγ is
very large, = 6± 2 fb [2]. Such a rate is very diﬃcult to accommodate in minimal versions of
theories that are often considered to be attractive extensions of the Standard Model (SM).
For example, it has been shown [3] that in its Minimal Supersymmetric extension (MSSM) [4],
while there are additional Higgs bosons beyond the already observed one that can indeed be
identiﬁed with the 750 GeV state, the diphoton rate cannot be generated using purely the
MSSM particle content. Hence, the Φ resonance must be accompanied by additional massive
charged particles to enhance the Φγγ decay amplitude and, eventually, the Φgg amplitude
in the likely case where the resonance is produced via the gluon fusion mechanism, gg → Φ.
An interesting possibility would be that these additional particles are electrically charged
and non–colored (generally vector–like) fermions that contribute only to the Φ → γγ decay;
see e.g. Ref. [3]. However, in this speciﬁc case, the large enhancement of the Φγγ amplitude
would require either i) several charged fermions, and/or ii) large electric charges, and/or
iii) strong Yukawa couplings. All these requirements could unfortunately put perturbation
theory under jeopardy [5]. The same problem occurs, although to a lesser extent, in certain
scenarios where additional colored particles contribute to the Φgg vertex [2, 3, 5].
One means by which this problem could be alleviated would be to assume that Φ is a
pseudoscalar state Φ ≡ A and that the charged fermions running in the Aγγ loop have masses
near the m = 1
1/2 [4, 6] that
characterizes the loop contributions of spin– 1
2 fermions as functions of the scalar to fermion
mass ratio (and which depends on the parity of the spin-zero state) becomes maximal and
much larger than in the very heavy or very light fermion mass limits. Nevertheless, even
in this particular case, the obtained AA
1/2 form factor is not suﬃcient to explain the large
diphoton rate in a minimal way and without endangering perturbation theory. We should
note that in the context of the MSSM, even for masses close to MA, the contribution of the
two χ±

1 chargino states to the A → γγ rate is too small as their couplings are very weak.

2MA kinematical threshold [3]. In this case, the form factor AΦ

In this paper, still assuming a pseudoscalar resonance and a charged and uncolored fermion
with a mass close to the 1
2MA threshold, we invoke an additional mechanism to enhance the
Aγγ loop amplitude: the charged fermions will form S–wave (quasi) bound states resulting
in a Coulomb singularity developing very close to this kinematical threshold [7–9]. This
singularity is regulated by the total decay width of the charged fermion which, if it is very
small, say Γ <∼ 1 MeV, allows an enhancement of the Aγγ amplitude by a large factor. This
means that with only one singly charged fermion having a reasonable Yukawa coupling to the
resonance, one could generate a A → γγ amplitude that is suﬃciently large to accommodate
the LHC diphoton signal. This interesting possibility will be studied in two speciﬁc examples.
We ﬁrst reconsider the MSSM [3], assuming that the CP–odd A state corresponds to the
750 GeV diphoton resonance and has a strong top quark Yukawa coupling. This already
allows for a signiﬁcant cross section in the top induced gg → A process and the large total
width, ΓA ≈ 45 GeV, hinted by the ATLAS data [1]. The required A → γγ decay rate is
then generated by loops of charginos with a mass mχ±
2MA for which the Aγγ form–factor

= 1

(cid:28) 1 MeV. Such a
develops a Coulomb singularity that is regulated by a chargino width Γχ±
small decay width can be achieved naturally by imposing that the only possible decay mode,
the one into the stable lightest neutralino and a fermion pair, occurs only at the three–body
level and is strongly suppressed. One can then have a large threshold enhancement which
easily explains the LHC diphoton data in this minimal supersymmetric model.

1

In a second scenario, we consider either the MSSM or a two Higgs doublet model (2HDM)
[10] in which the A state still corresponds to the new resonance as discussed above but where
the required A → γγ decay rate is now generated by two vector–like doublets and singlets of
heavy leptons [3]. The lightest charged lepton E has a mass very close to threshold mE = 1
2MA
and the Coulomb singularity is again regulated by a small decay width that is obtained by
assuming a lighter (possibly stable) neutral lepton N with a mass mE < mN + MW such that
the only available decay mode is the suppressed three–body channel E → N W ∗ → N f ¯f(cid:48).
We then explore the regions in the parameters ΓE and mE − mN that allow us to obtain the
enhancement factor which explains the ≈ 6 fb gg → A → γγ production rate at the LHC.
We also comment on a minimal scenario in which the 750 GeV resonance couples only to
photons and is therefore both produced and decays through the Aγγ loop induced coupling
[11]. In order to obtain the LHC diphoton rate in the process σ(pp → γγ → A → γγ), an
extremely large two–photon decay width is needed in this case. We show that, again, the
additional loop contribution of only one singly charged lepton with mass mE = 375 GeV and
total width ΓE ≈ 1 keV allows for a suﬃcient threshold enhancement of the Aγγ form–factor
to explain the data in this minima scenario.

Finally, in both the MSSM with a stable lightest neutralino and in a 2HDM where the
charged lepton E is accompanied by a stable neutral one N , we consider the tantalizing
possibility that the neutral particles are viable dark matter candidates [12]. We determine
the range of masses and couplings that would allow such a possibility, once the relevant
experimental constraints from direct and indirect dark matter searches are imposed.

2. Threshold enhancement of the diphoton width

Let us begin by discussing the possibility of a threshold enhancement in the general context
of a spin–zero CP–even H or CP–odd A state with two–photon decays induced by loops of
fermions with color number N c

malised to their SM-like values, λSM

Hence, near threshold, the form–factor AΦ
1/2 is much larger for a CP–odd state and we will thus
concentrate on this case in the rest of the discussion. Furthermore, we will only consider the
case where color–neutral fermions contribute in the loops: heavy quarks would also contribute
to the Agg loop–induced coupling1 and would generate unacceptably large production rates
in the situations which will be considered here (like in the pp → t¯t process for instance [16]).
Nevertheless, the expressions eqs. (2)–(3) above do not accurately describe the threshold
region mf ≈ 1
Indeed, for fermion masses just above but
very close to threshold, a Coulomb singularity develops due to the fermions forming S–wave
(quasi) bound states [17]. This can be taken into account, in a non-relativistic approach, by
re-writing the form factor close to threshold as [8]

2MΦ for the Aγγ form factor.

of a Coulomb potential V (r) = −α/r. The fermion decay width Γf is introduced in order to
regulate the Coulomb singularity in the Green’s function with real and imaginary parts [9]

orders2 [8]. The three terms in the above expressions correspond to the lowest order con-
tribution, a single Coulombic photon exchange and a sum over contributions involving the
exchange of n + 1 Coulombic photons. The position of the ﬁrst pole in Ef can be obtained
by inspecting the denominator of the n = 1 contribution to the last terms of the equations
above. Although the sum in n runs from 1 to ∞, the sum converges rather quickly and, in
reality, it is suﬃcient for our purposes to calculate up to n = 100.

1In principle, one expects these quarks to be rather heavy from LHC direct searches, mQ >∼ 800 GeV [13]
and hence beyond the mQ = 1
2 MΦ threshold. Nevertheless such a conﬁguration could be possible in some
special cases where bound states can form; see e.g. Ref. [14]. In the case where the resonance also couples
to top quarks, there would also be a signiﬁcant enhancement of the Aγγ amplitude near the MΦ ≈ 2mt
threshold [8, 15], but it is negligible in practice since a 750 GeV resonance is far from this conﬁguration.

2In principle, one could calculate higher order corrections to the coeﬃcients a and b; however, these are
not needed for this preliminary study as, in particular for the QED case, they should be highly suppressed.

1/2 on including
the threshold corrections compared to the leading order term, as a function of the fermion
total width Γf for several values of the mass diﬀerence Ef = MA − 2mf as indicated.

One should note that while the pole is present in both the real and imaginary parts, the
numerator p+ for the imaginary part is suppressed compared to that of the real part p−−p0/n
in the vicinity of the pole. The large enhancement of the two–photon form factor is therefore
obtained from the real part of the Green’s function.

As mentioned earlier, the bound-state formation results in poles in the form factor at
energies just below the threshold for pair production of the fermions, regulated by the width
of the fermions. The position of these poles in terms of the energy Ef as well as the size of
the enhancement therefore depends on the size of the total decay width and the coupling to
the photon. It occurs in an extremely narrow range of the mass diﬀerence Ef , O(0.1 MeV).
Besides the fact that the dominant contribution to the enhancement is from the real and
not the imaginary part of the form factor, one should note that in the CP–even scalar case,
the Hγγ form factor is P–wave and highly suppressed at the threshold; therefore, the bound
state formation can be neglected as in this case the possible enhancement is negligible.

In Fig. 1, we display the absolute value of the enhancement factor F deﬁned as

as a function of the total width of the fermion Γf , for a resonance mass MA = 750 GeV and
Ef = MA − 2mf values of −5.73, −5.75, −5.8 and −5.9 MeV. As can be seen, for Γf < 2
keV, one can obtain enhancement factors of 20 and beyond. As we shall see in the following
section, such a factor F ≈ 20 could explain the LHC results in the MSSM case, whereas in our
2HDM scenario a factor F ≈ 5 would be suﬃcient, requiring Γf (cid:46) 50 keV. The enhancement
factor is of course dependent on the choice of Ef or conversely mf , i.e. whether or not Ef
corresponds exactly to the position of the pole. This is the Achilles heel of our scenario as
some “ﬁne-tuning” is thus necessary.

Let us now discuss the implications of this possible threshold enhancement in some scenarii
for the 750 GeV Φ = A resonance, starting with the plain MSSM scenario.

√

In the MSSM, two Higgs doublets Φu and Φd are required to break the electroweak
symmetry leading to ﬁve physical states, two CP–even h and H, a CP–odd A and two charged
H± bosons [4]. In the so–called decoupling limit, MA (cid:29) MZ, the lighter h state is the Higgs
boson observed at the LHC in 2012 and subsequently determined to have SM–like properties,
while the Φ resonance is a superposition of the heavier neutral CP–even H and CP–odd A
that are nearly degenerate in mass (as is also the case of the charged Higgs boson). The two
states have zero tree–level couplings to vector bosons and similar couplings to fermions. The
latter are controlled by the ratio of vacuum expectation values tan β = vu/vd which is the
only relevant parameter in the Higgs sector of the model besides MA ≈ MH. For tan β ≈ 1,
2mt/(v tan β) ≈ 1.
the only important Yukawa coupling is the one of the top quark, yt =
At the LHC, the H/A states are mainly produced in the gg → Φ fusion mechanism that
is mediated by a top quark loop with an amplitude that is given by an expression similar
to that of eqs.(1)–(3) except for some color factors and the replacement of α with αs [6].
The cross sections are such that σ(gg → A) ≈ 2σ(gg → H) and for MΦ ≈ 750 GeV and
tan β ≈ 1, one obtains σ(A+H)≈ 2 pb at the
s = 13 TeV LHC [18]. The Φ = H/A states
will then mainly decay into top quark pairs with partial (≈ total) widths that are of order
ΓΦ ≈ 35 GeV close to the resonance width of 45 GeV favored by ATLAS. Concentrating on
the pseudoscalar A resonance, if the two-photon decay is generated by the top quark loop
only, the branching ratio for the relevant inputs is BR(A → γγ) ≈ 7 × 10−6 [19]. One thus
has a resonance production times decay rate of about σ(gg → A) × BR(A → γγ) ≈ 10−2 fb.
In Ref. [3], the possible loop contributions of the supersymmetric particles have been
analyzed and found to be far too small to explain the large two–photon decay rate. Here, we
will reconsider the chargino loop contribution to A → γγ in light of the possible threshold
enhancement discussed above. These contributions are brieﬂy summarized below.

Let us now turn to the case of a two–Higgs doublet model (2HDM) [10], again identifying
the pseudoscalar state A with the 750 GeV resonance. The phenomenology of A is exactly
the same as in the MSSM, in particular in the 2HDM alignment limit in which the lighter h
state is SM–like and assuming the charged H± boson to be heavy enough. The A production
mode at the LHC is the same as discussed above, but for the two–photon decay the only
contribution will be that coming from top quark loops which, much like in the MSSM case, is
again too small: an enhancement factor of at least ≈ 400 is required to obtain the resonance
cross section of σ(gg → A → γγ) ≈ 6± 2 fb measured at the LHC. Part of this enhancement
can be obtained by introducing a doublet and two singlets of heavy vector–like leptons3

In light of the data on the diphoton resonance, one then assumes that the lepton E1
2mE1/v ≈ 2, a value that is
has a mass mE1 ≈ 375 GeV and a Yukawa coupling yE
slightly below the perturbative limit. This allows an initial enhancement of the form factor
1/2 of the A → γγ amplitude. Nevertheless, to arrive at the needed value of σ ≈ 6 fb for
AA
the diphoton rate, the E amplitude needs to be further enhanced by a factor of about 4 to
6. In the original scenarios, see e.g. Ref. [3], several replicas of the above spectrum were
needed, leading to a model that is far from being minimal. This additional factor can be now
generated by the threshold enhancement of AA

coupling to two photons, which is measured to be SM–like, is not signiﬁcantly altered; see Ref. [3].

obtained with the minimal lepton spectrum of eq. (13). The small width ΓE1 can be obtained
simply by ensuring that the mass diﬀerence mE1 − mN1 is small and positive (this near mass
degeneracy is required anyway in order to comply with precision electroweak data [3]). This
makes that the only possible E1 decay is the three–body mode E1 → N1W ∗ → N1f ¯f(cid:48) which
requires a highly virtual W boson that strongly suppresses the decay width.
These decays of the heavy leptons have been discussed in Ref. [20] and using the relevant
formulae for the three–body E1 → N1W ∗ → N1f ¯f(cid:48) channel provided in the papers above, we
show in the left–hand side of Fig. 3, the partial decay width (which in the absence of fermion
mixing corresponds to the total width), ΓE1 = Γ(E1 → N1W ∗ → N1f ¯f(cid:48)), as a function of
mE1 − mN1. As can be seen a small width of about ΓE1 ≈ 1 keV can be obtained for a 50
GeV mass diﬀerence when sin θN (cid:39) 0.033. On the right–hand side of Fig. 3, the mixing angle
sin θN is shown as a function of the mass diﬀerence mE1 − mN1 for various values of the width
ΓE1. From Fig. 1, we have seen that for widths below ∼ 20 keV the desired enhancement
factor can be obtained. Therefore, a mass diﬀerence in the range mE1 − mN1 = 40–80 GeV
could easily lead to the 4–6 enhancement factor needed to explain the LHC diphoton data,
assuming that the A resonance is produced via gluon fusion.

Another possibility that is worth considering, although not in the 2HDM context, is if
the Φ resonance is produced via photon fusion mediated by lepton loops in the same manner
as the decay [11]. The enhancement factor F would therefore enter both in the production
and the decay. Note that, as the requirement of a 45 GeV total width preferred by ATLAS
needs not be imposed, the A coupling to two photons makes that A → γγ may even be the
√
dominant decay mode. In the case of production by photon fusion, the cross section at the

s = 13 TeV LHC can be expressed as [11]

σ(γγ → A → γγ) (cid:39) (91 − 240 fb) × Γtot

A (GeV) × [BR(A → γγ)]2

(16)

where the range in fb is due to the uncertainty in describing inelastic contributions to the
photon parton distribution function. For a given total width Γtot
A , eq. (16) can be used to
obtain the necessary A → γγ partial width in order to reproduce the observed σ(A) = 4–8

F in order to achieve such a partial width as a function of the total width Γtot
A . One ﬁnds
that if the dominant contribution to the total width originates from the γγ mode, the signal
observed at the LHC could be explained assuming photon fusion production if the threshold
enhancement factor F is about 2. If, in turn, the total width is closer to Γtot
A = 45 GeV, an
enhancement factor F of about 20 would be required.

4. Implications for Dark Matter

Since in both the scenarios we have studied, the lightest non-SM particles (the lightest neu-
tralino and the mostly singlet lightest heavy neutrino) are charge and color–neutral, it is
tempting to examine their viability as dark matter candidates.
In order to simplify the
discussion we assume as usual some discrete symmetry (R–parity in the MSSM and a Z2
symmetry in the 2HDM case under which the heavy leptons are even whereas all other ﬁelds
are odd) that renders the lightest new state completely stable. This assumption has actually
already, explicitly or implicitly, been made in the previous sections.

We begin with the 2HDM scenario, where the situation turns out to be more straight-
forward. Focusing on the regime where the dark matter annihilation is mediated by the
s-channel exchange of the pseudoscalar A state and including all relevant interactions be-
tween the dark matter particles and the SM ones, notably those mediated by the Z boson,
the relevant part of the Lagrangian eq. (14) in terms of mass eigenstates can be written as

where sθN ≡ sin θN , with similar notations in the charged sector. Note that we have ignored
A couplings to light fermions since their contributions, being Yukawa suppressed, are much
smaller than those of top and bottom quarks as well as those mediated by the Z–boson. We
will moreover restrict our analysis to N1 masses below ∼ 350 GeV. This choice is motivated by
the fact that for smaller E1, N1 mass splittings, co-annihilation processes become important
and should be taken into account4 [23]. For simplicity, we thus stick to parameter space
regions where these processes are expected to be subleading and can be neglected. To study
the dark matter aspects of the model, we have implemented the Lagrangian eq. (17) in the
public code MicrOMEGAs [24] with the help of the FeynRules package [25].

Our results are depicted in Fig. 4, where we highlight the (mN1, sin θN ) combinations
for which the latest limits on dark matter abundance from the Planck mission [26] can be
satisﬁed according to standard thermal freeze-out. The diﬀerent colorings correspond to
diﬀerent ranges for the predicted width of the lightest heavy electron E1 from the decay
mode E1 → N1W ∗ → N1f ¯f(cid:48). The other parameters entering the Lagrangian eq. (17) have
L = yt = 1 (which also amounts to a total width ΓA ≈ 40 GeV), while
been set to the values yN
for the calculation of the E1 decay width we have chosen mE1 = 375.003 GeV and sθE = 0.1.
The heavier neutrino mass mN2 has been set to a large value in this analysis.

A well-known constraint on dark matter scenarios involving vector–like couplings to the
Z boson comes from direct detection; see for example Ref. [27]. We have computed the

4In the co-annihilation region we would have to include a proper treatment of the – potentially Sommerfeld-

enhanced [21] – E1E1 annihilation, see e.g. Ref. [22], a task which goes well beyond our purposes.

dated analysis performed by the LUX collaboration [28]. The excluded regions of parameter
space are depicted by the gray-shaded area of Fig. 4. As expected, the direct detection limits
restrict the mixing of the singlet and doublet heavy neutrinos to small values, where the
annihilation is mostly dominated by A–boson exchange. For our choice of parameters, this
constraint also forces small values for the total width of the heavy electron ΓE1.

Additional constraints on the scenario come from searches for dark matter annihilation
– induced gamma rays and in particular from the Fermi satellite searches for continuum
gamma rays in Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies (dSphs) [29] and for gamma ray lines from the
Galactic center [30]. The former are depicted by the red band in Fig. 4. As for the latter,
we ﬁnd them to be subdominant throughout our parameter space even assuming a realistic
halo proﬁle for our Galaxy [32]. This might appear to be slightly counter-intuitive, since we
are invoking here a mechanism that signiﬁcantly boosts the diphoton signal. However, the
threshold enhancement which is eﬀective in the LHC environment is actually irrelevant in
the case of indirect detection, due to the fact that the center of mass energy is not suﬃcient
to produce the mediator A on–shell. This is actually an attractive up-shot of the threshold
enhancement mechanism invoked in our work, which relieves the tension that has been shown
to exist [31] in models attempting to relate the 750 GeV diphoton excess with dark matter.

5The spin-dependent scattering is found to be much weaker and will be ignored. Besides, we recall that
pseudoscalar couplings of Dirac dark matter to the SM particles yield a negligible spin-independent scattering
cross section, the latter being proportional to the momentum transfer which is extremely small compared to
the mass MA.

compatible with the small E1 width values needed in order to reproduce the LHC diphoton
excess, yielding a viable dark matter candidate under the form of a mostly singlet heavy
neutrino. Moreover, at least for the parameter ranges depicted in Fig. 4, we expect that direct
and indirect detection experiments will be able to probe the Planck compatible parameter
space region within the next few years.

thermal relic neutralinos cannot account for more than O(10%) of the total dark matter in
the universe. Note that even for under-abundant dark matter components direct detection
bounds do apply, upon appropriate rescaling of the limits. We ﬁnd that in the relevant region
of parameter space, the combination σSI × ΩMSSM/ΩPlanck lies below the LUX bounds.

In light of these ﬁndings, an interesting possibility would be to consider the option of
gravitino dark matter, potentially upon embedding of our MSSM scenario in a (most likely
general [33]) gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking framework. Given that the gravitino
abundance from neutralino decays will in general decrease as m ˜G/mχ0
with respect to the
– already under-abundant – neutralino relic density, the most likely scenario would in fact
be thermal gravitino production; see e.g. Ref. [34] and references therein. Performing such
an analysis goes beyond the scope of our study.
In any case, gravitino dark matter with
a general neutralino next-to-lightest superparticle has been extensively studied in Ref. [35].
Moreover, the under-abundance of these neutralinos should help relax the tension with Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints, see e.g. the recent discussion in Ref. [36].

5. Conclusions

In this paper, we have discussed the possibility of threshold enhancing the branching ratio
of the decay into two photons for a 750 GeV pseudoscalar boson A, in light of the recent
experimental hints of an excess in the diphoton spectrum at the LHC. If the loop mediating
the A → γγ decay was to contain new fermions at approximately half the mass of the
2MA∼ 375 GeV, then this decay could be signiﬁcantly enhanced. The precise
resonance, i.e. 1
value of the enhancement factor was shown to depend on the width and the mass of these new
fermions. Concretely, we found that fermion widths smaller than Γf < 100 keV, naturally
occurring in 3-body decay processes, and masses mf of a few MeV above 375 GeV could lead
to enhancement factors of 2 to 20 at the amplitude level. We then applied this idea to two
concrete new physics scenarios where A could be produced via the gluon fusion mechanism:
the minimal supersymmetric model and a two-Higgs doublet model augmented with one
vector-like doublet and two singlets of leptons.
≈ 375 GeV can provide
the necessary enhancement factor to attain a diphoton cross section of the order of 6 fb
as favoured by ATLAS and CMS. We examined the chargino total decay width, where the
chargino decays into a neutralino and a SM fermion pair through a suﬃciently oﬀ-shell

In the MSSM case, we found that a chargino with mass mχ±

If this width lies below ∼ 2 keV, a condition which can easily be satisﬁed for
W boson.
appropriate choices of the soft masses M1,2 and the higgsino mass parameter µ, the necessary
enhancement in the chargino loop in order to reproduce the observed diphoton excess, of the
order of 20 at the amplitude level, is obtained. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only
explanation of the 750 GeV diphoton excess that has been proposed in the literature within
the plain MSSM without any additional particle content (for an extension like the NMSSM
with no additional particles, see for instance Ref. [37]).

We then discussed the threshold enhancement mechanism in the context of a basic 2HDM
in which vector-like leptons are added to the spectrum. The lightest (mostly part of an
isodoublet which also contains a neutral lepton) charged lepton E1 is responsible for the
threshold enhancement and its width is again given by the three-body decay E1 → N1
¯f f(cid:48)
(with N1 being mostly an isosinglet). In a large region of parameter space, it is found to lie
in the desired region ΓE1 < 50 keV, resulting in an enhancement factor of the order of 4–6
at the amplitude level as required to explain the LHC diphoton data.
We moreover brieﬂy commented upon the possibility that the diphoton resonance is pro-
duced at the LHC via photon fusion, γγ → A → γγ. In this case, the necessary value of the
enhancement factor ranged from about 2 to 20, where the limiting values represent the cases
where the decay of the A state is restricted to the γγ mode or where the total width is taken
to be of the order of 45 GeV, as favoured by the ATLAS data.

As a ﬁnal exercise we studied whether the lightest neutral states of the new physics spec-
trum, the lightest neutralino in the MSSM and the lightest vector-like neutrino in our 2HDM
variant, can play the role of dark matter in the Universe, where appropriate symmetries pre-
vent the decay of these into SM particles. In our 2HDM scenario, we found that for the mass
range from mN1 ≈ 315 to 350 GeV it is perfectly possible to satisfy the Planck constraints on
the dark matter density in the Universe while being compatible with the LUX limits on the
spin-independent scattering cross section oﬀ nuclei and the Fermi-LAT indirect searches for
continuum γ-rays from dark matter annihilation in Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies. Searches for
gamma-ray lines were found to provide subleading constraints, since the threshold enhance-
ment mechanism is not eﬀective in dark matter annihilation at low velocities. In the MSSM
case, the neutralino relic density turns out to be below the Planck value such that the direct
detection constraints do not aﬀect the region of interest.

Finally, let us note again that the scenarios exhibiting threshold enhanced diphoton signals
are extremely contrived as they only occur in very narrow ranges of parameter space, i.e. of
mf−1
2MA; therefore ﬁne tuning at the 10 to 100 keV is required which may appear unnatural.
Nevertheless, as it allows one to avoid complicated scenarios (with possibly a large multiplicity
of new fermions) that are sometimes at the verge of being non-perturbative, Occams razor
leads us to believe that this ﬁne-tuned scenario could constitute a plausible option.
