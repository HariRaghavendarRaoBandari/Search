Abstract

The origin of the observed large scale magnetic ﬁelds in the Universe is a mystery. The seed of

these magnetic ﬁelds has been attributed to physical process in the early universe. In this work we

provide a mechanism for the generation of a primordial magnetic ﬁeld in the early universe via the

Weibel instability in the quark gluon plasma. The Weibel instability occurs in the plasma if there

is an anisotropy in the particle distribution function of the particles. In early universe, the velocity

anisotropy required for Weibel instability to operate is generated in the quark gluon plasma by

the collapse of closed Z(3) domain walls that arise in the deconﬁned phase of the QCD (above

T ∼ 200 MeV). Such large domains can arise in the context of certain low energy scale inﬂationary
models. The closed domains undergo supersonic collapse and the velocity anisotropy is generated

in the shocks produced in the wake of the collapsing domain walls. This results in a two stream

Weibel instability in the ultra-relativistic quark gluon plasma. The instability in turn generates

strong magnetic ﬁelds in the plasma. We ﬁnd that the ﬁeld strengths generated can be as high as

1019 G for the up/down quark streams. This is comparable to the equipartition energy density at

the QCD scale which is of the order of 1018 G.

INTRODUCTION

One of the main unsolved puzzles of modern cosmology is to explain the origin of the

observed magnetic ﬁelds in the Universe. For the galaxies and galaxy clusters, the observed
magnetic ﬁelds at the length scales of the order of a few kpc is about 1 − 10 µG. At Mpc
scales, the observations point towards a magnetic ﬁeld of the order of 10−15 − 10−18G. The
observations for kpc scales can be explained by producing the seed magnetic ﬁelds by a

Biermann battery mechanism in the proto galaxy, which are then ampliﬁed by a galactic

dynamo. However this process barely works for the large scale magnetic ﬁelds. An appealing

alternative to the above scenario is to argue that the seed magnetic ﬁeld has primordial

origin which gets ampliﬁed as the proto galactic cloud undergoes collapse. This would

naturally provide magnetic ﬁelds at all scales. We refer to [1–3] and citations therein for a

comprehensive review.

The universe has undergone various stages during its evolution and each of these stages

has the potential to provide the seed required to produce the observed magnetic ﬁeld. In

this work we focus on the epoch of the Quark-Hadron (Q-H) transition. This is expected to

occur when the universe was roughly micro-seconds old. Till the turn of the century the Q-H

transition was supposed to be a ﬁrst order transition. The bubble wall dynamics associated

with the ﬁrst order transition provided a rich spectrum of possibilities like quark nuggets as

dark matter candidates [4], production of baryon inhomogenties [5] and also the primordial

magnetic ﬁelds [6–8].

We very brieﬂy recall the various scenarios of magnetic ﬁeld generation which assume that

the QCD phase transition is of the ﬁrst order. If the universe underwent a ﬁrst order QCD

phase transition, then as the hadron bubbles expand in the quark gluon plasma (QGP)

phase the latent heat is released in the surrounding plasma. Under such a situation a

Biermann battery can operate in the early universe. The estimates in [6] gave a magnetic

ﬁeld strength of 5G at 100cm scales, which is very low. Cheng and Olinto [7] looked at

the baryon density contrast between the shrinking quark regions and expanding hadronic

bubbles. Such a contrast is created because of the “snowplow” eﬀect due to the expanding
bubble wall. They found that the generated magnetic ﬁelds were of the order of 106 − 108G.
This translates to galactic magnetic ﬁelds of the order of 10−11G today which is 5 orders of

magnitude smaller than the observed ﬁelds. In ref [8] the hydrodynamic instabilities on the

2

bubble walls were studied. Such instabilities can be present if the latent heat transport is

primarily due to the ﬂuid ﬂow. These instabilities coupled with the baryon density contrast

can then create the magnetic ﬁelds. They found ﬁeld strengths of 10−20G on the 10Mpc

comoving scale. None of the above scenarios hold in the light of results from lattice gauge

theory showing that a ﬁrst order quark-hadron transition is very unlikely. The transition,

for the range of chemical potentials relevant for the early universe, is most likely a crossover.

See ref. [9] and references therein for details on the discussion of the order of the transition.

Our proposal for an alternate mechanism for the magnetic ﬁeld generation utilizes the

relativistic generalization of the Weibel instability in a plasma. Weibel [10] had argued that

a plasma with anisotropic particle distribution is inherently unstable against inﬁnitesimal

magnetic ﬁeld perturbations. As a result the inﬁnitesimal small ﬁeld perturbation grow until

they reach a saturation. The relativistic generalization of Weibel instability was provided

by Yoon and Davidson [11]. Various computer simulations of Weibel instability have also

been performed for both the non-relativistic as well as relativistic plasma, see [12, 13] and

references cited therein. It was argued in [14] that the Weibel instability could operate in

GRB shocks where anisotropy in the particle distribution function is provided by the direc-

tion of shock propagation. In the early universe, the anisotropy could have come from the

hydrodynamic instabilities of the hadronic bubbles in the QGP background if the transition

was of the ﬁrst order. However, as discussed above, that is not the case. As it turns out,

the quark-hadron phase boundary is only one of the possibility for the interface. In addition

to the phase boundary, the possibility of extended topological objects in the quark-gluon

plasma (QGP) phase of QCD has been extensively discussed in the literature [15–17]. These

are domain wall defects that arise from the spontaneous breaking of Z(3) symmetry in the

high temperature phase (QGP phase) of QCD. Assuming that the collapsing Z(3) regions

are spherical, we ﬁnd that they inevitably undergo a supersonic collapse. This would lead

to a shock front in the wake of the collapsing wall.

Moreover, previous works [18, 19] on these collapsing domains indicate that the trans-

mission coeﬃcients of the quarks through the domain walls depend on their mass. Thus

more strange quarks are reﬂected by the domain wall as compared to the up/down quarks.

This gives rise to a bulid up of charge asymmetry and baryon concentration across the

wall. The resulting baryon inhomogeneity and the charge asymmetry will give rise to a

velocity anisotropy distribution in the plasma. The presence of the shock coupled with this

3

anisotropy leads to a large anisotropy in the average kinetic energy of the plasma particles.

Such anisotropies in the kinetic energy lead to kinetic instabilities. The Weibel instability

is one such instability which is usually generated for such an anisotropic plasma.

For nonrelativistic plasma, details of the Weibel instability have been calculated for a

wide range of equilibrium distribution functions. However, for a relativistic anisotropic

plasma an analytical solution was obtained in [11] for a speciﬁc distribution based on the

Water Bag (WB) model. Yoon et al. [11] worked out the solution for a distribution where

the ﬂow was along the z-axis and the two velocities are parallel and perpendicular to the

ﬂow direction. The plasma in the early universe does not have a speciﬁc ﬂow direction. The

particles move randomly in all directions. The presence of the shock wave gives a direction

to the ﬂow of the particles in the vicinity of the collapsing domain wall. We take that to be

our ﬂow direction. So we are able to deﬁne the two velocities similar to those used by Yoon

et al.

[11]. The two velocities are parallel and perpendicular to the velocity of the shock.

This distribution leads to the Weibel instability being generated which subsequently leads

to the generation of the magnetic ﬁeld.

An important point to note is that Z(3) symmetry is broken in the QGP phase, which

is the high temperature phase of QCD and restored in the conﬁned phase which is the low

temperature phase. This is in contrast to the other symmetry breaking phase transitions

like GUT or electro-weak, where the symmetry is broken in the low temperature phase. As
a result the Z(3) defects vanish below the conﬁnement transition temperature (∼ 200 MeV,
unlike the GUT defects which are created in the low temperature phase) and, consequently,

the constraints on topological defects coming from CMBR observations by WMAP or Planck

[20, 21] do not apply to Z(3) defects. It is then interesting to look for the possible signatures

these defects might have left if they were present in the early universe. This work is one

such eﬀort in that direction.

In the presence of quarks, questions have been raised on the existence of these objects [22,

23]. However, lattice studies by Deka et al. [24] of QCD with quarks show strong possibility

of the existence of non-trivial, metastable, Z(3) vacua for high temperatures of order 700

MeV. The above studies are exciting as such high temperatures occur naturally in the early

universe.

It may also be possible to probe the existence of these defects in the ongoing

relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments at LHC-CERN. These are the only topological

defects in a relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory which can be probed in lab conditions with the

4

present day accelerators. Detailed simulations have been performed to study the formation

and evolution of these objects in these experiments [25, 26].

The organization of the paper is as follows. In section II we take a quick look at the Z(3)

symmetry, the symmetry of the Polyakov loop which is the order parameter of the conﬁne-

ment transition. We then discuss the formation of Z(3) structures in the early universe.

There we discuss in detail the eﬀects of quarks in the context of inﬂationary cosmology and

how in certain low energy inﬂationary models, these Z(3) domains can survive long enough

to have interesting cosmological implications. In section III we focus on the dynamical evo-

lution of these domains and show that these collapsing domains indeed undergo supersonic

collapse. The generation of magnetic ﬁelds from resulting shocks via Weibel instability is

the subject of section IV. We present our results and conclusions in section V.

II. Z(3) DEFECTS IN EARLY UNIVERSE

A. Z(3) domains in QGP

We start our discussion with pure SU(N) gauge theory. In pure gauge SU(N) system,

in thermal equilibrium at temperature T , the Polyakov loop [27–29] is deﬁned as

L(x) =

1
N

Tr(cid:20)P exp(cid:18)igZ β

0

A0(~x, τ )dτ(cid:19)(cid:21).

(1)

Here, β = T −1 and A0(~x, τ ) = Aa

0(~x, τ )T a, (a = 1, . . . N) are the SU(N) gauge ﬁelds sat-
isfying the periodic boundary conditions in the Euclidean time direction τ , viz A0(~x, 0) =
A0(~x, β). T a are the generators of SU (N) in the fundamental representation. P denotes

the path ordering in the Euclidean time τ , and g is the gauge coupling. The trace denotes
the summing over color degrees of freedom. Thermal average of the Polyakov loop, hL(~x)i,
is related to the free energy of a test quark in a pure gluonic medium, hL(~x)i ∝ e−βF . In
conﬁned phase, the free energy of a test quark is inﬁnite hence hL(~x)i = 0 (i.e. system is be-
low Tc). In deconﬁned phase a test quark has ﬁnite free energy and hence hL(~x)i 6= 0. Thus
hL(~x)i acts as the order parameter for the conﬁnement-deconﬁnement phase transition. For
brevity, we will use l(x) to denote hL(~x)i from now on. Under Z(N) transformation (which
is the center of SU(N)), the Polyakov Loop transforms as

l(x) −→ Z × l(x),
5

where Z = eiφ,

(2)

where, φ = 2πm/N; m = 0, 1 . . . (N − 1). This leads to the spontaneous breaking of Z(N)
symmetry with N degenerate vacua in the deconﬁned phase or QGP phase. For QCD,

N = 3 hence it has three degenerate Z(3) vacua resulting from the spontaneous breaking

of Z(3) symmetry at T > Tc. This leads to the formation of interfaces between regions of

diﬀerent Z(N) vacua. These vacua are characterized by,

l(~x) = 1, ei2π/3, ei4π/3.

(3)

Even though these Z(3) domains contribute to the thermodynamics of SU(N) gauge

theory, it has been argued that these Z(3) domains do not have a “physical” meaning [22, 23].

The inclusion of dynamical quarks further complicates the issue, as they do not respect the

Z(N) symmetry. It has been argued that the eﬀect of addition of quarks can be interpreted

as the explicit breaking of Z(N) symmetry, see, for example, refs. [30–33]. This leads to the

lifting of degeneracy of the vacuum, with l(~x) = 1 as the true vacuum and l(~x) = ei2π/3, ei4π/3

as the metastable ones. We will follow this approach. This interpretation ﬁnds support in

the lattice QCD studies with quarks [24]. These result strongly favor these metastable Z(3)

vacua at high temperature. These Z(3) vacua can have important consequences in the case

of early universe where these high temperatures occur quite naturally. The aim of this work

is to bring to light one such possibility, namely the generation of a primordial magnetic ﬁeld,

due to the evolution of these domains in the quark-gluon plasma.

In the last decade or so, there has been some eﬀort in understanding various properties of

these defects. In [34], the existence of topological string defects at the junction of Z(3) defects

was established. The reﬂection of quarks/antiquarks from Z(3) walls was ﬁrst studied in ref.

[18] and it was shown that baryon inhomogeneities can be produced in the QGP phase by the

collapsing Z(3) walls. It was also argued that the collapsing Z(3) domains can concentrate

enough baryon number (in certain late time inﬂationary models) to form quark nuggets thus

providing us with an alternate scenario of quark nuggets formation in early universe, which

is independent of the order of phase transition. This analysis was extended in ref.

[19]

by incorporating an interesting possibility arising from the spontaneous CP violation from

Z(3) interfaces. This was ﬁrst discussed by Altes et al [35], who showed that spontaneous

CP violation can arise from Z(N) structures due to the non-trivial background gauge ﬁeld

conﬁguration associated with the Polyakov loop. The ﬁrst quantitative estimates of the CP

violation in the quark scattering were made in [36] for the case of pure gauge QCD. These

6

were extended to QCD with quarks in ref [37].

B. Formation of Z(3) domains in early universe

One important diﬀerence for the formation of Z(3) walls compared to the formation of

other topological defects in the early universe arises from the fact that here symmetry is

broken in the high temperature phase, and is restored as the universe cools while expanding.

In the standard picture of defect formation, the symmetry is broken in the low temperature

phase and defects are formed during the transition to the symmetry broken phase via Kibble

mechanism [38]. The question then arises as to how these defects were formed if the universe

was in the symmetry broken phase to start with. To discuss the detailed formation of Z(3)

structures using standard defect formation scenario, one would require a situation where the

universe undergoes the transition from the hadronic (conﬁned/low temperature) phase to

the QGP (deconﬁned/high temperature) phase. Kibble mechanism [38] can then be invoked

to study the formation of these defects. This idea was ﬁrst discussed in detail in [18].

The quarks and gluons were deconﬁned before inﬂation as the universe was at a very high

temperature (T >> Tc). During inﬂation the universe cools exponentially due to the rapid

expansion. During this cooling, as the temperature drops below the critical temperature Tc

(if universe remains in quasi-equilibrium during this period) or as the energy density drops

below ΛQCD due to expansion (in a standard out of equilibrium scenario) any previously

existing Z(3) interfaces disappear. As the universe starts reheating, after inﬂation, the tem-

perature eventually becomes higher than the critical temperature for conﬁnement-deconﬁned

transition. Z(3) symmetry will then break spontaneously, and Z(3) walls and associated

QGP string will form via the standard Kibble mechanism. However, in presence of quarks,

there is an explicit breaking of Z(3) symmetry. Two of the vacua, with l(x) = z, z2, become

metastable leading to a pressure diﬀerence between the true vacuum and the metastable

vacua [35, 39]. This leads to a preferential shrinking of the metastable vacua. Note that

the pressure diﬀerence between the true vacuum and metastable vacuum may aﬀect the

formation of these domains. For example, there may be a bias in the formation of these

domains as temperature crosses Tc due to this pressure diﬀerence. Though such a bias may

get washed out by the thermal ﬂuctuations and the continued rapid reheating at the end of

inﬂation when equilibrium concepts may not strictly apply.

7

As we will see in section III the collapse of these regions can be very fast (the numerical
simulations conducted in context of heavy-ion collisions too indicate vw ∼ 1 [25, 26]), they
are unlikely to survive until late times, say until QCD scale. However there are certain

situations in which these domains can survive till late times. We will discuss those scenarios

next. If these domains survive till late times (which cannot be below the QCD transition

epoch), then the magnetic ﬁelds will be generated near the QCD transition epoch.

C. Survivability Scenarios for Z(3) Defects till QCD Scale

Friction Dominated Dynamics:- The simplest possibility is that the collapse of Z(3)

domains may be slower due to the friction experienced by domain wall. For large friction, the

walls may even remain almost frozen in the plasma. It has been discussed in the literature

that dynamics of light cosmic strings can be dominated by friction which strongly aﬀects the

coarsening of string network [40, 41]. For example, it is plausible that the dynamics of these

Z(3) walls is friction dominated because of the non-trivial scattering of quarks across the

wall. This can lead to signiﬁcant friction in wall motion. Only when the surface tension and

the pressure diﬀerence between the true and metastable vaccua dominates over the friction

at the late times, the walls will start collapsing. In such a scenario the anisotropy, and hence

the magnetic ﬁelds, can be generated even near the QCD transition epoch.

Low energy inﬂationary models:- Even if the dynamics of the domain walls is not strongly

friction dominated, it is still possible for these Z(3) domains to survive until the QCD scale,

in certain low energy inﬂationary models [42–44]. In these models the reheating temperature
can be quite low (∼ 1 T eV , or preferably, even lower)). With inclusion of some small friction
in the dynamics of domain walls, it is then possible for the walls to survive until QCD

transition. For detailed discussion of these issues regarding formation of Z(3) walls in the

early Universe see ref.[18].

Eﬀective Restoration of Z(3) at very high temperatures:- An interesting result has been

obtained in lattice studies of SU(N) with Higgs by Biswal et al [45] where they show that

Z(N) is restored at high temperatures. They ﬁnd that breaking of Z(N) is directly related

to Higgs symmetry breaking. It is eﬀectively restored in the Higgs symmetric phase and

Z(N) domains start appearing only in the Higgs broken phase. They suggest that a similar
mechanism can operate for SU(N) with fermions where ¯ψγ0ψ can play the role of the scalar.

8

Another situation could be when the thermal ﬂuctuations are larger than the energy barrier.

In that case there will be eﬀectively no Z(3) domains until the Universe cools down to the

temperatures where the ﬂuctuations in the energy are smaller than the potential barrier

between the two regions.

After formation, the domain wall network undergoes coarsening, leading to only a few

domain walls within the horizon volume. Detailed simulation of the formation and evolution

of these Z(3) walls in the context of RHICE is discussed in ref [25, 26]. The evolution of

these Z(3) domain walls, once they are formed, can be understood quite well from these

simulations. Even though the simulations rely on the bubble nucleation, the domain wall

network obtained is reasonably independent of that. This is because the basic physics of the

Kibble mechanism only requires formation of uncorrelated domains which happens in any

transition.

III. SHOCK PRODUCTION BY COLLAPSING DOMAIN WALLS

In this section, we describe the generation of shocks by collapsing domain walls. We

start by describing the collapse of bubbles which have already been discussed in great detail

in ref.

[46]. As mentioned by the authors, the methodology also works for the collapse of

spherical domain walls in the“thin wall” limit, see [47–49]. We ignore the eﬀects of gravity

and work with ﬂat space-time. The following discussion is along the lines of ref. [48], which

is quite general and can be applied to both the ﬁrst order phase transition bubbles as well

as topological defects such as closed domain walls. The starting point is the Lagrangian for

the surface of the collapsing interface,

where σ is the surface tension of the wall, U is the potential energy due to non-degeneracy

L = −σ[det(cid:0)−g(3)(cid:1)]1/2 − U ,

(4)

of the vaccua. g(3) is the three-metric on the surface of the domain wall. If xµ are usual

spacetime coordinates and χa are the coordinates for the domain wall hypersurface, then

g(3)
ab = gµνxµ

with xµ

,a ≡ ∂xµ/∂χa. For a spherical case the convenient coordinate choice is spherical polar
coordinates i.e xµ = (t, r, θ, φ) and χa = (t, θ, φ). Expanding r in spherical harmonics viz,

r = R (t) +Xl,m

∆lmYlm (θ, φ)

,

and writing the Lagrangian given by eq. 4 upto the ﬁrst order in ∆lm/R, one gets

L = −σr2(cid:0)1 − ˙r2(cid:1)1/2

sin (θ) +

ǫ

,

where ǫ is diﬀerence between the true vaccua and the metastable vaccua, with ǫ > 0 for the

true vaccua expanding in the background of metastable vaccua. The equation of motion for

wall at the zeroth order is then given by

¨R =

ǫ

σ (cid:16)1 − ˙R2(cid:17)3/2

R(cid:16)1 − ˙R2(cid:17) ,

which can be integrated to give

(cid:16)1 − ˙R2(cid:17)1/2

=

ǫR3/3σ + C

,

(8)

(9)

where C is the constant of integration. We are interested in the asymptotic solutions of eq.
9 for the collapsing domains (R → 0). In this limit, we ﬁnd that | ˙R| → 1. As a result when
a metastable spherical domain collapses, it will produce shocks.

We now return to the scenario of the collapsing Z(3) domains. As has been discussed

previously in II, collapsing Z(3) domain walls lead to the concentration of baryon numbers.

As the reﬂection of quarks/antiquarks depend upon the masses of the quarks. This leads

to a larger number of strange quarks being reﬂected by the domain walls as compared to

up/down quarks [18]. This gives rise to a charge imbalance across the domain wall. This is a

very local eﬀect and only aﬀects those particles in the plasma which are close to the domain

wall. Now the QGP is a multiparticle plasma and will have several distribution functions

for the individual particles (quarks/antiquarks, gluons and leptons). Due to the charge on

the domain wall some charges are repelled, while the opposite charges are accelerated. Thus

the local phase velocity of the diﬀerent streams of particles do not remain the same. There

will be a distortion in the MHD wave travelling in the plasma as the wall collapses. As
the velocity of the wall increases, and | ˙R| → 1, shocks will be generated. These shocks
will however result in an anisotropic velocity distribution with the particles moving in the

direction of shock moving with almost close to the speed of light.

10

Weibel [10] has shown that an anisotropic velocity distribution in a non-relativistic plasma

would give rise to an instability. The instability, which is a two stream instability (called the

Weibel instability) gives rise to a magnetic ﬁeld in the plasma. The Weibel instability was

generalized by Yoon and Davidson, ref.

[11], for an ultra-relativistic collisionless plasma.

Medvedev and Loeb [14] used the relativistic Weibel instability to generate strong magnetic

ﬁelds in shocks produced by Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). The instability was driven by the

anisotropic particle distribution function in the shock. Similarly the shocks generated in the

wake of the collapsing domain wall will also have an anisotropic particle distribution. This

means that a Weibel instability will be generated in the quark gluon plasma. In the next

section, we would like to calculate the magnetic ﬁeld generated due to the Weibal instability

in the wake of the collapsing domain wall.

IV. MAGNETIC FIELDS GENERATED BY THE WEIBEL INSTABILITY

While for the non-relativistic case, the instability is well understood, for the relativistic

plasma only approximate analytical solutions are allowed. This is because the parallel and

perpendicular motions of the particles in the plasma are coupled by the Lorentz factor

γ. Since we are dealing with a very high temperature plasma here, we work with the

ultrarelativistic plasma.

As argued previously, due to the charge concentration inside the collapsing Z(3) region,

some particles are accelerated while others are decelerated as they pass near the domain wall.

The net particle distribution can only be obtained from detailed simulations. However, since

we are interested in obtaining a preliminary estimate of the magnetic ﬁeld generated by the

Weibal instability, we just use the particular choice of Particle Distribution Function (PDF)

used by Yoon and Davidson, [11]. They had adopted the Water Bag (WB) model to obtain

an analytic solution to the dispersion relations obtained from the ﬂow of an anisotropic

unmagnetized plasma. They had also studied the detailed properties of the Weibel instability

generated in the plasma. Their PDF is given by,

(10)

F (~p) =

1

2πp⊥

δ (p⊥ − p1)

1
2pk

H(cid:0)p2

2 − p2
k(cid:1) ,

where H (x) is the Heaviside step function. This PDF assumes that the charged particles

move on a surface with perpendicular momenta p⊥ and are uniformly distributed in parallel

11

momenta between pk = −p2 and pk = p2. Since the particles ﬂow along the shock generated,
therefore |pk| = p2 is the shock velocity. The perpendicular momenta is taken to be p1.
This PDF can be solved exactly by substituting it in the kinetic equation and the dispersion

relations obtained. The detailed calculations are available in ref.[11]. Finally, it can be

shown that the instability occurs for the range of wave numbers given by

Γmax, dominates the evolution of magnetic ﬁeld and sets the characteristic length scale,

In this work, we are working with natural units and hence c = 1. Eq. 12 gets much

simpliﬁed if one takes into account the fact that the early universe plasma is ultra relativistic,

so that γ⊥ >> 1. Also as the collapse velocity of domain walls approaches the speed of light,
γk >> γ⊥. So under these approximations, the expression for k2

(14)

As the magnetic ﬁeld grows, the deﬂection of the particles grows leading to an increase

in the cyclotron radius of the particles. Only the particles travelling along the ﬁeld lines can

travel distances larger than the cyclotron radius. Also the cyclotron radius cannot be larger

than the correlation length scale of the magnetic ﬁeld. Hence

In the above relation m = m0γ is the relativistic mass. Only when v⊥ ∼ vk, the cyclotron
radius of the particles will be comparable to the correlation length scale of the magnetic ﬁeld.

Essentially as pointed out in ref.[11], the growth of the instability is due to the anisotropy of

the energy in the plasma. The evolution of the instability gradually leads to the equipartition

of the energy, which stabilizes the plasma. The magnetic ﬁeld gets satuarated at this point

and the distribution function becomes isotropic. The saturation ﬁeld strength is then given

by

In the next section, we discuss about the magnetic ﬁelds generated by the Weibel mech-

anism in the QCD epoch, near the quark hadron transition i.e at the temperatures close to

200 MeV.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

As the Z(3) domains are characterized by the thermal expectation value of the Polyakov

loop (section II A), which is related to the free energy of the test quark, the domain wall

is characterized by the change in the free energy of a test quark as one moves from one

Z(3) region to another. This essentially means that the interaction of the domain wall is

only with quarks and not with leptons. Therefore the Weibel instability generated in the

shock would be due to the anisotropy in the velocity of the quarks. The charge built up

inside the collapsing regions due to the baryon concentration, as shown in ref.

[18, 19],

would also aﬀect the charged leptons. Since that is a secondary eﬀect we do the magnetic

ﬁeld calculations for the quark sector only. As we are calculating the saturated magnetic

ﬁelds, i.e when the particles have become isotropic, the baryon number density is given by

the equilibrium baryon number density around T = 200 MeV, which is roughly of the order

1 fm−3. Since the magnetic force will aﬀect the lightest quark most, we take the mass of
the particle appropriate for the u/d quark i.e m ∼ 10 MeV. Also the plasma is an ultra-
relativistic one vk ∼ 1. Substituting all these in the equation we get an approximate value
for the magnetic ﬁeld B as 1019 G.

Actually, the expression for the magnetic ﬁeld can be put in a useful form by squaring

13

and rearranging it to get,

B2/8π

= (cid:0)γk − 1(cid:1)
2√2γk

,

(17)

m0n(cid:0)γk − 1(cid:1)

which for γk >> 1, indicates that the magnetic ﬁeld energy is close to the equipartition

energies. This is also borne out by our approximate estimate since the equipartition value

of the magnetic ﬁeld at 100MeV is about Beq = 1018G [7].

The discussion on Weibel instability in previous section was based on the linear analysis.

However in the late stages of the evolution, the non-linearity kicks in and hence the magnetic

ﬁeld is unable to attain the equipartition value. The numerical simulations performed in

the electro-magnetic (EM) plasma indicate that magnetic ﬁeld density obtained is lower
than the equipartition energies, B ∼ 0.1Beq. In the case of the QGP, it is known that the
Equation of State (EoS) deviates strongly from the ideal case near the transition point. So

it is natural to question the validity to map the simulations of an EM plasma exactly onto

a QGP plasma. The earlier studies of the shrinking Z(3) domains [18, 19], have shown that
near the baryon over-densities in the collapsing region can be quite large (∼ 106 times the
average baryon density). Under such large densities it is quite possible that the quark-gluon

plasma is quite well described by the perturbative QCD. Thus it is reasonable to expect that

in that regime the EoS follows the ideal gas relation. The magnetic ﬁelds in that case could

be as large as 1017 G. In the initial stages of the collapse, when the baryon concentration

inside the shrinking region is not very large, the non-ideal eﬀects are important. Though one

cannot apply the results of EM simulations at those stages, it is possible to discuss the eﬀects

that an non ideal ﬂuid can have on the generation of the magnetic ﬁeld. Usually in non-

ideal ﬂuids, it is seen that shocks and instabilities are damped due to the presence of energy

dissipating eﬀects such as viscosity and thermal conductivity. It might so happen that due

to the high thermal conductivity, the magnetic ﬁeld would reach saturation at an early stage

but that will only aﬀect our ﬁnal estimates by an order of magnitude or so. That would

imply that the ﬁelds generated would be of lesser magnitude, as saturation point is reached

earlier. One important factor that we have glossed over is the fact that the QGP is a multi-

component plasma. Our estimation of the magnetic ﬁeld is for the u/d component of the

plasma. In diﬀerent components, the magnetic ﬁeld will grow a diﬀerent rate. For example,

the masses of u/d and s quark diﬀer considerably, hence the instability may satuarate for

the u/d quarks but could still continue for the s quark. Also as mentioned above, the

14

charge concentration inside the collapsing regions would eﬀect leptons and hence give rise to

anisotropic distribution in the leptonic component of the early universe plasma. We have not

discussed these complications but we would like to emphasize that the spherically collapsing

Z(3) domains would always generate shocks and will ensure that two stream instabilities

are generated in the QGP. Finally, of course, numerical simulations of a Weibel instabilty

in the quark gluon plasma would give us a better estimate of the magnetic ﬁeld.

The only drawback of our model is the small correlation length of the generated magnetic

ﬁeld. This is the general problem for most primordial magnetic ﬁelds generated in very early

times (except during inﬂation). The large scale growth of magnetic ﬁelds has been seen in

numerical simulations of Weibel instability in the EM plasma by modelling the upstream

and the downstream of particles as the current carrying ﬁlaments [50]. They ﬁnd the ﬁeld

scale grows similar to that of inverse cascade of MHD simualtions even though the process

are entirely kinetic in nature in a two stream Weibel instability. It would be interesting to

see how the numerical results fare in the QGP case.

In MHD, the magnetic ﬁeld can be ampliﬁed by the inverse cascade mechanism if it is a

helical magnetic ﬁeld. Since the magnetic ﬁeld here is generated by a spherically collapsing

domain wall, the bulk ﬂow will not be helical. The only possibility of generating a helical

magnetic ﬁeld will be if the average density of the Chern-Simons number turns out to be non-

zero. Even a small helicity in the magnetic ﬁeld would ensure its ampliﬁcation to maximally

helical ﬁelds in the present epoch. This could be an actual possibility in our case, since CP

violating quark scattering does occur from asymmetric Z(3) interfaces [36]. We would like

to explore this further in a future work. Detailed magneto-hydrodynamic studies have been

carried out [51] which show that a rapid growth of the correlation length can occur due to

decaying turbulence in the plasma. Such a growth can occur even for a non-helical magnetic

ﬁeld, however the growth is slower than in the helical case.

Finally we would like to mention that the non-abelian analogue of Weibel instability for

QCD is the Chromo-Weibel instability. The Chromo-Weibel instability has been studied

in quite detail in the context of relativistic heavy ion collision (RHIC) expriments [52–

55], as there is an inherent anisotropy in the initial stages of the collisions. Since in the

above scenario the Weibel instability acts on quarks, the Chromo-Weibel instabilty could

also operate in the early universe plasma. It would be interesting to study various aspects

of this Chromo Weibel instabiltiy in context of the early universe plasma. The magnetic

15

ﬁelds present during the QCD phase transitions (deconﬁnement and/or Chiral) can aﬀect the

dynamics of transition. It would again be quite interesting to study the possible implications

of such altered dynamics of phase transition in the presence of magnetic ﬁelds.
