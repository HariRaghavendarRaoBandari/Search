Combinatorial decompositions, Kirillov-Reshetikhin invariants and

the Volume Conjecture for hyperbolic polyhedra

Alexander Kolpakov

Jun Murakami

Abstract

We suggest a method of computing volume for a simple polytope P
in three-dimensional hyperbolic space H3. This method combines the
combinatorial reduction of P as a trivalent graph Γ (the 1-skeleton of
P ) by I − H, or Whitehead, moves (together with shrinking of trian-
gular faces) aligned with its geometric splitting into generalised tetra-
hedra. With each decomposition (under some conditions) we associate
a potential function Φ such that the volume of P can be expressed
through a critical values of Φ. The results of our numeric experiments
with this method suggest that one may associated the above men-
tioned sequence of combinatorial moves with the sequence of moves
required for computing the Kirillov-Reshetikhin invariants of the triva-
lent graph Γ. Then the corresponding geometric decomposition of P
might be used in order to establish a link between the volume of P and
the asymptotic behaviour of the Kirillov-Reshetikhin invariants of Γ,
which is colloquially know as the Volume Conjecture.

Key words: hyperbolic polyhedron, I-H move, Whitehead move,

volume.

Introduction

In this paper we suggest a method of computing volume for a polytope P
in three-dimensional hyperbolic space H3. We require the polytope P to be
simple, so that the computation of volumes may combine two processes of
initially diﬀerent nature. First, a reduction of P (as a trivalent graph) to the
tetrahedron by a sequence of I − H (or Whitehead) and so-called “capping”
moves. And second, a decomposition of P into a number of generalised
tetrahedra Ti, i = 1, . . . , n, such that Ti partition P into geometric parts,

and Vol P =Pn

i=1 Vol Ti.

With such a decomposition we associate a function Φ(ℓ1, . . . , ℓm), m ≥ 1,
that depends on some additional geometric parameters of the decomposition
(in fact. lengths of some common perpendiculars to the faces of P ). Under
some conditions, we show that Vol P can be expressed through the value of
Φ(ℓ∗
Finally, we use our method in a large number of examples, by implementing
it in Wolfram Mathematica R(cid:13) [12]. We also check our computations, where
possible, with the Orb software [5].
This part of our work falls in line with the recent study on the Volume
Conjecture for generalised tetrahedra by Costantino and Murakami [2] and
for general hyperbolic polytopes by Costantino, Gu´eritaud and van der Veen
[3].
Next,given a polytope P , we consider its 1-skeleton Γ as a trivalent graph,
compute the Kirillov-Reshetikhin invariants of Γ with an appropriate colour-
ing of its edges determined by the corresponding dihedral angles of P and
study their asymptotic behaviour. We conjecture that the sequence of com-
binatorial moves that is used in order to compute the Kirillov-Reshetikhin
invariants of the corresponding trivalent graph Γ is associated with the se-
quence of moves used in the combinatorial reduction of P . Then the geo-
metric decomposition of P associated with the respective sequence of I − H
and capping moves might be used in order to establish a link between the
volume of P and the asymptotic behaviour of the Kirillov-Reshetikhin invari-
ants of Γ. Such a link has been colloquially named the Volume Conjecture
by various authors, and is ﬁrst established in [7].
The paper is structured as follows: after recalling some preliminary results
on the volume formulas for generalised hyperbolic tetrahedra (cf.
[9, 10]
and [11]), we proceed to the description of our method and formulate the
main statement of the paper. We illustrate our method in two main work-
ing examples: computing the volume of a hyperbolic prism Π, and that of
a hyperbolic “pleated” prism P. Then, we provide a more computation-
ally complicated example of a dodecahedron with various Coxeter dihedral
angles. However, the method of present paper is not restricted to Coxeter
polytopes. We expect it to work in a wide variety of dihedral angles, and
expect that it can be generalised to allow computing volumes of knotted
trivalent graphs.
Finally, we state a number of conjectures relating the volume of a hyper-
bolic polyhedron P to the Kirillov-Reshetikhin invariants of its 1-skeleton
Γ, viewed as a trivalent graph in the topological 3-sphere. Various numeric
experiments are described, that corroborate our conjectures.

2 Preliminaries

Below, we describe a method to compute the volume of a simple polyhedron
P ⊂ H3 that admits a decomposition into generalised hyperbolic tetrahe-
dra. We recall, that a convex polytope P is simple if the valence of each
vertex equals the dimension of P . Here, it means that each vertex of P is
trivalent. Now we deﬁne a generalised tetrahedron, and the decomposition
of a given polyhedron P into such generalised tetrahedra following a simple
combinatorial procedure.
Prior to doing so, we describe two combinatorial operations on the one-
skeleton of P , associated with a decomposition into generalised tetrahedra.
The ﬁrst is the classical I − H move, and the second is capping a triangular
face with a tetrahedron:

Figure 1: An I − H move

1. I − H move: depicted in Fig. 1.

It consist of “switching” the edge
between face 1 and face 3 to the edge between face 2 and face 4, and
can be applied unless it collapses any of these faces.

2. Capping: depicted in Fig. 2. It results in placing a tetrahedron over
face 1, such that the faces 2, 3 and 4 continue until they reach the new
vertex.

3

Figure 2: A “capping” move

These moves have been introduced in [8], and later used in [3, 2] for the
purposes of deﬁning a statistical sum over a spin network associated with a
hyperbolic polyhedron.
It’s not hard to see that the following statement holds.

Figure 3: A pentagonal prism Π

Lemma 1 Suppose that P is a simple polyhedron, which is not a tetrahedron.
Then there exists a sequence of I −H moves and capping moves transforming
P into a tetrahedron.

Example. Let us take a pentagonal prism Π depicted in Fig. 3 and apply a
sequence of combinatorial transformations to its one-skeleton, as shown in
Fig. 4.
Thus, having applied a short sequence of combinatorial moves we obtain a
tetrahedron. ♦

4

Figure 4: A sequence of I − H and capping moves applied to the prism Π

Example. Let us take a pentagonal pleated prism P depicted in Fig. 5
and apply a sequence of combinatorial transformation to its one-skeleton,
as shown in Fig. 6. ♦
Let us deﬁne a generalised hyperbolic tetrahedron T . Let Hnk, k = 1, 4,
be four planes with the respective outer normal vectors nk, k = 1, 4. We
compose the generalised Gram matrix of T as the Gram matrix of the system
of vectors nk. From the matrix G we produce the dual (generalised) Gram
matrix of T , that corresponds to its “vertices” vk, although some of them
are outer normals to the respective polar planes Pvk . If vk is ultra-ideal, we
associate with it a plane Hvk = Pvk , otherwise we put Hvk = H3. Given a
plane Hn with the outer normal n, let H +
n denote the half-space which n
points to and let H −
n denote the half-space which −n points to. Then, the
generalised hyperbolic tetrahedron T is deﬁned as

T =  4
\k=1

H −

nk! ∩   4
\k=1

H −

vk! .

Thus, each generalised tetrahedron T still can be characterised by six param-
eters a1, a2, . . . , a6, each of which corresponds to an edge of the “standard”
tetrahedron. However, we have to distinguish two cases:

1. if the planes Hni and Hnj intersect along an edge eij with parameter

ak, then we set ak = eiαk , where αk is the dihedral angle along eij;

5

Figure 5: A pentagonal pleated prism P

2. if the planes Hni and Hnj are ultra-parallel, then the vertices vk and vl
are ultra-ideal and the planes Hvk and Hvl intersect along the common
perpendicular pij to Hni and Hnj : thus we set the respective parameter
ak = e−ℓk , where ℓk is the length of pij.

In Fig. 7 the case of a prism-truncated tetrahedron (see [9, 10] and [11]) is
illustrated in detail. This type of generalised tetrahedron will appear quite
often in the examples below, as well as several other types that we enumerate
below.
With each type of generalised tetrahedron T we associate a symbol t|a . . . |p . . .
where we indicate which parameters ak correspond to dihedral angles (their
indices follow the letter “a” in the symbol), and which parameters ak cor-
respond to common perpendiculars’ lengths (their indices follow the letter
“p”). Thus, given a symbol t|a . . . |p . . . , we can produce the corresponding
generalised tetrahedron T from the standard one by truncating the respec-
tive vertices and letting the corresponding polar planes intersect. Then we
can recover the geometric parameters of T , such as its dihedral angles and/or
edge lengths. The Gram matrix G of T in this case is still given by

where V = V (a1, . . . , a6) is the “volume function”, as described in [11].
2. Two pairs of ultra-parallel faces. In Fig. 9, illustrate the case t|a2356|p14.
Here, all the vertices of T are ultra-ideal.

Lemma 2 The volume of a generalised hyperbolic tetrahedron can be ex-
pressed by one of the formulae (7)-(11).

The proof of the lemma above is analogous to the proof of [11, Proposition
3] (each of the above formulae are simpliﬁed versions of [9, Theorem 1]). We

10

Figure 12: A tetrahedron of type t|a14|p2356

also refer the reader to [1] for a geometric interpretation of the extra terms
involving derivatives of V in the volume formulae above.
Let us now reconsider the previous examples of a pentagonal prism Π and
a pleated prism P. We shall derive a geometric decomposition for each of
them from the associated sequence of combinatorial transformations.
Example. Let us consider the ﬁrst transformation ih1 of the prism Π, as
depicted in Fig. 4. Let us suppose that the common perpendicular p67 to
the plane 6 and the plane 7 is situated entirely inside Π. Then we draw two
planes S1 and S2 orthogonal to the sides 1 and 2 of Π. Suppose these planes
land on the sides of Π in its interior. Then we cut along Π along the planes
1 and 2, and thus “chop oﬀ” a polyhedron T1 bounded by the planes of the
faces 1, 2, 6 and 7 intersecting along the respective edges (or, more precisely,
parts of edges) of the initial prism Π, and the planes S1 and S2 intersecting
along p67. Let us note that T1 is nothing but a generalised tetrahedron of
type t|a12345|p6.
The capping transformations cap1, cap2 and cap3 in Fig. 4 correspond to
further “chopping oﬀ” of generalised tetrahedra (of type t|a12345|p6):

- the tetrahedron T2, formed by the planes 2, 3, 6, 7, and the planes S2,

S3 (orthogonal to the faces 2 and 3, respectively),

- the tetrahedron the tetrahedron T3, formed by the planes 1, 5, 6, 7,
and the planes S3, S5 (orthogonal to the faces 1 and 5, respectively),

- the tetrahedron the tetrahedron T4, formed by the planes 3, 4, 6, 7,
and the planes S3, S4 (orthogonal to the faces 3 and 4, respectively).

In each case we assume that the plane Sk lands orthogonally on the k-th face
of Π in its interior. Thus, the prism Π is divided into generalised tetrahedra.

11

Figure 13: A geometric decomposition of Π into tetrahedra Ti, i = 1, . . . , 5,
of type t|a12345|p6

The last tetrahedron in Fig. 4 corresponds to the generalised tetrahedron
T5 formed by the planes 4, 5, 6, 7 and S4, S5.
The geometric decomposition of the prism Π following the combinatorial
moves in Fig. 4 is depicted in Fig. 13, with all the tetrahedra Ti marked. ♦

Example. Let us consider the ﬁrst transformation ih1 of the pleated prism
P. Let us suppose that the common perpendiculars to any pairs of faces
lie inside P, if they exist. Let us take the common perpendicular p67 to the
plane 6 and the plane 7. Then we perform the transformation ih1 on the
edge e12 (the intersection of the planes 1 and 2). This results in detaching
a generalised tetrahedron T1, corresponding to the planes 1, 2, 6 and 7 (the
normals to these planes determine T1 completely, however there are two
more polar planes bounding it), whose edges consist of the edges involved in
the ih1 move, and the edges coming from the intersection of the planes S1
and S2, orthogonal to the faces 1 and 2, and passing through the common
perpendicular p67 to the plane 6 and the plane 7. The planes S1 and S2
intersect along p67 and land on the faces 1 and 2, respectively, as well as
they intersect the planes 6 and 7, yielding seven new edges in total.
Here and below we suppose that each plane Sk, orthogonal to the k-th face
of P, lands on it orthogonally and inside P.
The transformations cap1 and cap2, which result in capping the triangular
faces in Fig. 6 mean further detaching of the generalised tetrahedra T2 and
T3, formed by the planes 2, 3, 6, 7 and 1, 5, 6, 7, respectively.

12

Now we consider the transformation ih2 performed on the edge e48 (the
intersection of planes 4 and 8). We take the common perpendicular p35 to
the planes 3 and 5, and again suppose that it lies inside the pleated prism
P. We draw two planes passing through p35: S4 orthogonal to the face
4, and S8 orthogonal to the face 8. Now, we detach one more generalised
tetrahedron T4 formed by the planes 3, 4, 5 and 8.
The transformation c3 and c4 correspond to detaching two more tetrahedra:
T5 formed by the planes 3, 5, 6 and 8, and T6 formed by the planes 3, 5, 4
and 7.
Here we supposed that all possible common perpendiculars are situated in-
side Π, the planes coming through the common perpendiculars orthogonally
to the faces of P land in the interior of the faces. This implies that the
generalised tetrahedra Tk do not overlap. In other words, we suppose that
the tetrahedra Tk form a decomposition of P: we shall write P = ⊔kTk. ♦
Below we give examples where the above decomposition is realised for a
concrete polyhedron, having the combinatorial type of a pentagonal prism
or a pleated prism and prescribed dihedral angles.

Figure 14: A geometric realisation of the prism Π with given dihedral angles,
and its decomposition into generalised tetrahedra

Example. Let us consider the pentagonal prism Π depicted in Fig. 14. Each
edge of Π is labelled with an label q/p, corresponding to a dihedral angle of
pπ/q. In this case, the common perpendicular p67 to the planes 6 and 7 lies
entirely inside the prism Π, and the planes Sk, k = 1, . . . , 5 passing through
p67 and orthogonal to the sides of Π subdivide the prism into ﬁve “prism
tetrahedra of type t|a12345|p6), k = 1, 5,
truncated” tetrahedra Tk (i.e.
In this decomposition all the generalised

tetrahedra Tk have disjoint interiors, and Π = ⊔5

Tk, as well as the volume of the prism Π is computed in [11]: Vol Tk =
0.52639, Vol Π = 5 · Vol Tk ≈ 2.63200. Here we use formula (7) to compute
the volumes of all Tk, k = 1, . . . , 5.
As described in [11], the volume computation proceeds by composing the
function

Φ(ℓ) =

Vol Tk + πℓ,

Xk=1

where ℓ is the length of the common perpendicular p56, and solving the
equation

∂Φ(ℓ)

∂ℓ

= 0.

We can transform the last equation into an algebraic equation about x = e−ℓ:

∂Φ
∂ℓ = 1.

e

This equation can be easily solved, which allows us to determine the neces-
sary parameter ℓ. ♦

Figure 15: A geometric realisation of the prism P with given dihedral
angles, and its decomposition into generalised tetrahedra

Example. Now we consider the pleated prism P depicted in Fig. 15 together
with the labels for its dihedral angles. The common perpendiculars p1 = p67
(to the planes 6 and 7) and p2 = p35 (to the planes 3 and 5) in this case lie
inside P, and the planes Sk, k = 1, . . . , 8, passing through each of them,
respectively, land orthogonally into the interior of the k-th face. Then the
pleated prism P is decomposed into seven generalised tetrahedra Tk: six
are of type t|a12345|p6 (the tetrahedra 1-3 and 5-7), and one is of type
t|a2356|p14 (the tetrahedron 4 in the middle).

14

We compute the volume of P. In order to do so, let ℓk, k = 1, 2, denote the
length of pk. Then we have

Vol P =

Xk=1

where we use formula (7) for the tetrahedra Tk, k ∈ {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7} (of type
t|a12345|p6) and formula (8) for the tetrahedron T4 (of type t|a2356|p14).
The tetrahedra Tk form the pleated prism P when the angle sum around
each pl equals 2π. The dihedral angle along the edge playing the role of pl
in each generalised tetrahedron equals

Then, from the above equations, we deduce that ℓk is a solution to the
system of equations

We can transform the above equations into a system of algebraic equations
in the variables xk = e−ℓk :

∂Φ
∂ℓk = 1, k = 1, 2.

e

This equation is as a polynomial equation in the variables xk, and can be
easily solved by computer. Moreover, the functions ∂Φ
are monotone in
∂ℓk
each variable ℓk, k = 1, 2, while keeping the other variable ﬁxed (in the
domain where the function Φ is deﬁned). This follows from the fact that the
respective dihedral angles of the tetrahedra Tk, k = 1, . . . , 7, are monotone
functions of ℓk, k = 1, 2 (cf. Fig. 16).
Solving the above equations about ℓk, we obtain that they have a unique
common solution (ℓ1, ℓ2) ≈ (0.383438, 1.06239), and the volume of P is
consequently equal to ∼ 2.34308. Here we use formula (7) to compute the
volumes of Tk, k ∈ {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, and formula (8) to compute the volume
of T4. ♦

3 Volume of a polyhedron

We prove the following theorem, that allows us for computing the volume
of a ﬁnite-volume simple polyhedron P , provided it has a decomposition
into generalised tetrahedra, e.g. produced by a sequence of IH-moves and
“capping” transformations. An analogous synthesis of a combinatorial de-
composition followed by a geometric volume computation may be found in
[4, 13] as applied to Euclidean polyhedra.

Theorem 1 Let P ⊂ H3 be a ﬁnite-volume simple polyhedron that admits a
decomposition into generalised tetrahedra Tk such that the volume of P can
be expressed as

Vol P =X Vol Tk(ak1, . . . , ak6),

(12)

where akl are the six angle/length parameters corresponding to each gener-
alised tetrahedron, the angle parameters akl = eiαkl come from the original
dihedral angles of the polyhedron, and the edge parameters akl = e−ℓkl are
determined from a solution to the system of algebraic equations, in which
each equation is associated with a common perpendicular pkl to some faces
Fk and Fl of P serving as an edge for a number of generalised tetrahedra

Since the polyhedron P admits a decomposition into generalised tetrahedra
Tk, then for some length parameters ℓkl (which will be the same for each
tetrahedron Tm whose edge ℓkl coincides with the common perpendicular
pkl) we have

αkl = 2π.

Xpkl∩Tm6=∅

(16)

Thus, (16) implies (15) for these length ℓkl.
Looking at the expression for the function Vol Tk, we observe that ∂Φkl(ℓkl)
consists of logarithms of monomials in the parameters akl where the longest
monomial has the form ak1l1ak2l2ak3l3ak4l4. Thus, if all akmkn happen to be
edge parameters (i.e. akmkn = e−ℓkmkn ) then we have an equation of degree
four, at most. (cid:3)
Let us call a ﬁnite-volume polyhedron P ⊂ H3 “width uniform” if all the
common perpendiculars to its facets lie inside P . The following fact obvi-
ously holds as a consequence of geodesic convexity.

∂ℓkl

Lemma 3 Every Coxeter polytope (or, more generally, every acute-angled
polyhedron) is width uniform.

A width uniform polyhedron has a geometric decomposition into generalised
tetrahedra. We notice that each polytope P may be decomposed into a
number of generalised tetrahedra Tk, although some of them may overlap,
and thus we shall need to use the “inclusion-exclusion” formula in order
to express the volume of P through the volumes of Tk. As well, some of
the polar hyperplanes bounding Tk may land on the faces of P entirely

17

Figure 17: Some examples of “butterﬂy” generalised tetrahedra

or partially outside P forming “butterﬂy” generalised tetrahedra, some of
which are depicted in Fig. 17, c.f. [11].
The volume formula of [11] works in either case, however, the glueing equa-
tions (13)-(14) will not have a unique solution. Still, the value of the volume
of P can be found by using some solution among (usually few) solutions of
the glueing equations.

4 Further computational examples

Below we give more numeric examples of volume computation for several
polytopes. We start with the pleated prism P, and then proceed to a
dodecahedron D. We shall use Coxeter dihedral angles (i.e. dihedral angles
of the form π/n, for n a natural number ≥ 2), so we can “double-check” the
volume of each polytope P with the following procedure: the volume of P
equals the volume of the reﬂection orbifold obtained from P by mirroring all
its faces. We create a “double” of the respective reﬂection orbifold, which
is an orientable orbifold O(P ) with underlying space the three-sphere S3,
and singular set combinatorially isomorphic to the 1-skeleton of P . Each
singular edge e carries an angle of 2π/n, corresponding to the angle of π/n
in the original polytope P . The volume of O(P ) can be computed by the
“Orb” software [5], and Vol O(P ) = 2 VolP .
First, we pick the pleated prism P from our previous example, and reduce
it to a tetrahedron by a diﬀerent sequence of I − H and capping moves
depicted in Fig. 18. Thus, the position of the common perpendiculars in the
new subdivision will be diﬀerent.
As shown in Fig. 19, we have again 7 tetrahedra to consider, ﬁve of which are

Figure 18: Another sequence of I − H and capping moves reducing the
pleated prism P to a tetrahedron

of the type t|a12356|p4 (the tetrahedra Ti, i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}), and two are of
the type t|a1234|p56 (the tetrahedra Ti, i ∈ {4, 5}). Here, our computations
ﬁnd that the length of the common perpendicular p1 = p67 to the planes 6
and 7 is ℓ1 ≈ 0.383438, and the length of the common perpendicular p2 = p47
to the planes 4 and 7 is ℓ2 ≈ 0.626516. The volume of the prism P equals,
as before, Vol P ≈ 2.34308.
By using various sequences of I − H and capping moves, and therefore
various geometric decompositions, we also found the volumes of pleated
prisms depicted in Fig. 20.
Finally, we use our method to compute the volume of a hyperbolic dodec-
ahedron D. The sequence of I − H and capping moves is presented in
Fig. 21-Fig. 23, and leads to the following generalised tetrahedra in the
geometric decomposition:

- 6 generalised tetrahedra of type t|a12356p4,

- 6 generalised tetrahedra of type t|a1234p56,

- 2 generalised tetrahedra of type t|a123p456,

- 2 generalised tetrahedra of type t|a14p2356.

We consider three distinct dodecahedra: D1 with all right angles, D2 with all
dihedral angles equal to π/3, and D3 with angles from the set {π/2, π/3, π/4}

5 Computing Kirillov-Reshetikhin invariants and

the Volume Conjecture

We conjecture that the way in which a width-uniform polytope P ⊂ H3 is
decomposed into generalised tetrahedra may be related to the sequence of
combinatorial moves in which the Kirillov-Reshetikhin invariants of the cor-
responding trivalent graph Γ (given by the 1-skeleton of P ) are computed.
The following conjecture relating the volume Vol P to the asymptotic be-
haviour of the Kirillov-Reshetikhin invariants of Γ has been corroborated by
the results of our numerical experiments.

Conjecture 1 Let P ⊂ H3 be a hyperbolic polyhedron with edges e1, · · · , em
and dihedral angle along each edge ei, i = 1, . . . , m, respectively, αi. Let Γ
be the planar graph represented by the 1-skeleton of P . Let c(r) be a sequence
of colourings s(r)
(1 ≤ i ≤ m, r = 3, 5, 7, · · · ) for the edges e1, · · · , em of Γ
such that

variant with framing c(2n+1)) associated with Γ, c.f. [2, 3].

Each time an I − H move or a capping move is performed on Γ, we have
a generalised tetrahedron detached from the polyhedron P . As a step to-
wards veriﬁcation of Conjecture 1 we suggest investigating if the following
statements hold.

perbolic tetrahedron T , which may have ideal and ultra-ideal vertices, though
no truncating polar planes determined by its ultra-ideal vertices intersect.

α < arccos(1/3).
It is ideal for α = π/3, truncated (i.e. has ultra-ideal
vertices) hyperbolic for 0 < α < π/3, and it deforms into a regular ideal
octahedron O for α = 0. The octahedron O has all dihedral angles equal to
π/2 and its volume is Vol O ≈ 3.663....

Let us notice that the tetrahedron considered in the above conjecture is
supposed to have only mild vertex truncations, c.f.
[9]. Another conjec-
ture considers a generalised hyperbolic tetrahedron T with some vertices
intensely truncated. We specify this conjecture for the case of a prism
truncated tetrahedron, considered in [9, 11]. Although, one may state an
analogous conjecture for a generalised tetrahedron of any type considered in
Section 2.

Conjecture 3 Let α, β, γ, δ, ǫ, φ be the dihedral angles of a prism truncated
hyperbolic tetrahedron T , which may have ideal or ultra-ideal vertices.∗ Let
the parameter φ represent the dihedral angle at the edge arising from intense
truncation. Let a(r), b(r), · · · , f (r) (r = 3, 5, 7, · · · ) be sequences of integers
satisfying

Since the volume of P is a sum of volumes of the generalised tetrahedra Ti
composing it, we hope that there might be a correspondence between the
asymptotic behaviour of the sums (17)-(18) associated with each tetrahe-
dron Ti, and the asymptotic behaviour of the Kirillov-Reshetikhin invariant
hΓ, c(r)i of the whole polyhedron P .
