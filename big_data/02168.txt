Molecular dynamics simulations to study the behaviour of anionic (Sodium Dodecylsulfate, SDS) and nonionic
(Monooleate of Sorbitan, SPAN80) surfactants close to a SiO2 (silicon dioxide) surface were carried out. Simula-
tions showed that a water layer was ﬁrst adsorbed on the surface and then the surfactants were attached on that
layer. Moreover, it was observed that water behaviour close to the surface inﬂuenced the surfactant adsorption
since a semi-spherical micelle was formed on the SiO2 surface with SDS molecules whereas a cylindrical micelle
was formed with SPAN80 molecules. Adsorption of the micelles was conducted in terms of structural properties
(density proﬁles and angular distributions) and dynamical behaviour (diffusion coeﬃcients) of the systems. Fi-
nally, it was also shown that some water molecules moved inside the solid surface and located at speciﬁc sites
of the solid surface.

1. Introduction

Adsorption of surfactant molecules at solid-liquid interfaces has been investigated for years not only
for its relevance in science but also for its numerous industrial applications, such as detergency, crude oil
reﬁning, treatment of waste water, adsorption on activated charcoal and even in pharmaceutical prepa-
rations [1–3].

In particular, self-assembly of surfactant molecules on solid surfaces has shown different issues from
those observed at liquid/vapor and at liquid/liquid interfaces. For instance, it has been observed that
interactions between hydrophobic tails, repulsions between headgroups and interactions between sur-
factant molecules with solid surface [4, 5] could change the isotherms at the critic micellar concentration
(CMC). Therefore, studies of surfactant aggregation will help us to obtain more physical insights of self-
assembly phenomena [6, 7].

From the experimental point of view, the surfactant adsorption on surfaces has been studied by dif-
ferent techniques, such as streaming potential methods [8], calorimetry [9], neutron reﬂection [10], ellip-
sometry [11], ﬂuorescence spectroscopy [12] and atomic force microscopy (AFM) [13]. In fact, AFM has
proved to be a reliable technique to obtain information on the topology of surfactant aggregation since it
allows us to observe how surfactants are formed on surfaces. For instance, CTAB arrays in parallel stripes
on a graphite surface [14], SDS forms hemimicelles on a rough gold surface [15] and similar morphologies
have been seen for other surfactants on hydrophobic surfaces [16–18].

On the other hand, computer simulations have been very useful to study such complex systems. For
instance, Monte Carlo simulations have been used to provide information on structural transitions of sur-

factant aggregation [19] while molecular dynamics simulations have been used to investigate aggregation
at atomistic scales [20, 21]. In previous papers we have reported the surfactant behaviour on different
surfaces [21–24]. It has been observed how graphite surfaces impose orientational order on the surfac-
tant tails [21, 24] and how different solid faces of a titanium dioxide produced different aggregates on the
surface [22, 23]. In the present work we are interested to extend the studies of surfactant aggregation on
a hydrophilic SiO2 (silicon dioxide) surface in order to compare the behaviour of surfactant molecules on
different solid substrates.

2. Computational method and model

Molecular dynamics simulations of anionic and nonionic surfactant molecules at silicon dioxide sur-
face (SiO2), in its Cristobalite form, were carried out for the present study. The surface was constructed
using an atomistic model with a surface orientation (001) (ﬁgure 1). The parameters used for a solid
surface were taken from reference [25].

Figure 1. (Color online) The unit crystal cell and a snapshot of the solid surface. Oxygen atoms are in red
and silicon atoms are in yellow.

For the anionic surfactant molecule, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), a model of 12 united carbon atoms
attached to a headgroup (SO4) was simulated by using a force ﬁeld already reported in the literature [21].
For the nonionic surfactant molecule, Monooleate of Sorbitan (SPAN80), there was used, a model with
17 united carbon atoms, three OH− and one ester groups in the head group. The force ﬁeld reported in
reference [23] was used for this molecule.

In the case of simulations with the anionic molecules, the initial conﬁguration was prepared from a
monolayer of 36 molecules in all-trans-conﬁguration with the headgroups initially pointed to the solid
surface. Then, 2535 water molecules were added (using the SPC model [26]) to the system and 36 sodium
cations (Na+). In the case of simulations with nonionic molecules, 25 molecules were used with the same
number of water molecules.

A simulation box having dimensions X = Y = 43.7019 and Z = 150 Å was used with the usual periodic
boundary conditions. The Z -dimension of the box was long enough to prevent the formation of a second
water/solid interface due to the periodicity of the system. Instead, a liquid/vapor interface was present at
one end of the box (z > 0) whereas at the other end of the box (z < 0) beyond the solid there was an empty
space. All simulations were carried out in the NVT ensemble with a time step of 0.002 ps using DL-POLY
package [27]. Bond lengths were constrained using SHAKE algorithm with a tolerance of 10−4, and the
temperature was controlled using the Hoover-Nose thermostat having a relaxation time of 0.2 ps [28] at
T = 298 K. Long-range electrostatic interactions were handled using the Particle Mesh Ewald method,
and the Van der Waals interactions were cut off at 10 Å. Finally, the simulations were run up to 40 ns
and conﬁgurational energy was monitored as a function of time in order to determine the moment the
systems have reached equilibrium. Then, the last 2 ns were collected for analysis.

3. Results

In this section we present calculations of the surfactant molecules at the SiO2 surface. Studies on the
behaviour of the surfactant molecules and how they aggregate at the liquid/solid interface are discussed.

3.1. Density proﬁles

In order to determine where the surfactant molecules arrayed in the system, mass Z -dependent den-

sity proﬁles for the headgroups and the tails were calculated, i.e., normal to the liquid/solid interface.

From ﬁgure 2 we observed that water molecules (dotted line) were not only adsorbed but also ab-
sorbed by the solid surface which is located at a position of Z = −23 Å in the ﬁgure. In fact, the ﬁrst water
proﬁle peak (to the right of the surface) indicated strong adsorption, i.e., a water layer on the surface. The
other water peaks (to the left of the surface) suggested that few particles were inside the solid surface.
The presence of water molecules inside SiO2 surfaces has been also observed in real experiments [29, 30].
On the other hand, SDS density proﬁles showed a strong ﬁrst peak for the polar group (≈ 4 Å from the
surface in ﬁgure 2 (a) suggesting that the surfactant was well adsorbed on the surface. Moreover, it was
noted that the peak was located to the right of the adsorbed water layer. The result showed that the sur-
factant molecules formed a micellar structure adsorbed on the water layer on the solid surface. It was
also possible to observe that the hydrocarbon chains (solid line) were sited between polar-groups (dashed
line) along Z direction.

In the case of simulations with SPAN80 molecules [ﬁgure 2 (b)], the water density proﬁle also showed
that some of those molecules went deep into the substrate. Besides, unlike SDS system, here strong peaks
were observed for the water proﬁles. The SPAN80 proﬁles are also shown, the ﬁrst peak (≈ 5 Å from the
surface) corresponded to the hydrocarbon chains and it was very close to the polar group, nevertheless
the hydrocarbon chains were surrounded by the polar groups. These proﬁles suggested the formation of

In ﬁgure 3, snapshots of the ﬁnal SDS [ﬁgure 3 (a)] and SPAN80 [ﬁgures 3 (b) and 3 (c)] are shown. In
those ﬁgures it was possible to observe the micellar structure mentioned above. In the case of the SDS,
the micelle structure had a spherical-like shape (snapshot in X − Z and Y − Z looked alike) whereas for
SPAN80 the micelle had a cylindrical-like structure [see ﬁgures 3 (b) and 3 (c)].

two directions, X and Y , were calculated. In ﬁgures 4 (a) and 4 (b), head groups density proﬁles (dashed
line) and tail groups (solid line) of SDS molecules are shown. There were observed similarities between
the two particle proﬁles, ρ(X ) and ρ(Y ), where it was noted that polar groups surrounded the tail groups.
In both tail group proﬁles, a small sharp peak can be seen. In this case, SDS molecules are well adsorbed
on the SiO2 substrate with some surfactants attached on the surface by the head group [see ﬁgure 3 (a)].
Then, there is a possibility that a SDS molecule could remain anchored with its tail moving in one region
only. This could explain the small sharp peak observed in both proﬁles, i.e., there are a bit more tail
groups in that region. On the other hand, from the Z -particle density proﬁle in ﬁgure 4 (c), a big head
group peak could be seen close to the solid surface (see also ﬁgure 2), i.e., there was an excess of head
groups attached to the surface. Moreover, the ρ(Z ) indicated that the size of the micelle in the Z -direction
was smaller than in the X − Y directions. Therefore, the structure can be described as a sphere deformed
along the perpendicular direction of the solid surface.

This calculation was also carried out for the SPAN80 molecules [ﬁgures 4 (d)–4 (f)]. In ﬁgure 4 (d),
the density proﬁle along X -axis is shown where a molecular aggregation is observed. In ﬁgure 4 (e),
the proﬁles indicated a uniform distribution of the molecules along the Y -axis whereas in ﬁgure 4 (f)
it was again possible to observe aggregation of the molecules next to the surface. Here, it can be seen
that headgroups partially surrounded the tail groups. Then, these proﬁles revealed that the molecules
structured themselves as a cylindrical micelle along the Y direction. These results suggested that the
effect of the solid surface in the micelle formation was minimum.

3.2. Water orientation at the SiO2 surface

As it was observed above, water density proﬁles showed strong peaks close to the SiO2 surface sug-
gesting that those molecules might have some structure close to the solid. Therefore, studies of how water
molecules were oriented in the solid were carried out. The analyses were conducted over the molecules
in the adsorbed layers only (deﬁned by the peaks of ﬁgure 2).

In ﬁgure 5, angular distributions of water molecules are shown for the SDS and SPAN80 systems.
The orientation of the water molecules was measured as the angle between the bisector vector of the
OH bonds and the vector normal to the interface (see ﬁgure 5). In both systems, SDS and SPAN80, there
was observed a privileged orientation of the water molecules, i.e., they were nearly perpendicular to
the surface. In fact, there was noted a larger number of water molecules pointing perpendicular to the
surface for the SPAN80 system [high peak in ﬁgure 5 (b)] than for the SDS system (small peak). Moreover,
the water angle distribution presented a small peak when water interacted with SPAN80 [ﬁgure 5 (b)]
and a wider distribution when water interacted with SDS.

lines). Panels (a) and (b) atom positions for the SDS surfactant in the X and Y axis. Panels (c) and (d) atom
positions for the SPAN80 surfactant in the X and Y axis.

In ﬁgure 6, the distribution (in the ﬁrst adsorbed water layer) of water molecules in the X and Y
directions, i.e., in the X − Y plane, is plotted. Figures 6 (a) and 6 (b) show the water oxygens positions in
the solid surface for the SDS system. In the same ﬁgure 6, the positions of the silicon atoms of the SiO2
surface are also shown in the same X − Y directions. In all cases it was observed that water molecules
(solid lines) were located only in speciﬁc sites. In fact, they were placed on the silicon atoms of the solid
surface (indicated by the dashed lines in ﬁgure 6). Figures 6 (c) and 6 (d) are the same plots for the SPAN80
system. From the above results we noted that water oxygens were adsorbed above silicon sites.

3.3. Mobility of surfactant molecules

In order to describe the attachment of the surfactant molecules to the solid surface, the diffusion
coeﬃcient of the molecular aggregates was also calculated. The diffusion coeﬃcients were calculated
in each direction by measuring the square mean displacements of the surfactant atoms and using the
Einstein relation. For the SPAN80 surfactant, the diffusions were 0.126 × 10−9 m2/s, 0.095 × 10−9 m2/s
and 0.085 × 10−9 m2/s in the X , Y and Z directions, respectively. For the SDS surfactant, the diffusions
were 0.125 × 10−9 m2/s, 0.135 × 10−9 m2/s and 0.078 × 10−9 m2/s in the X , Y and Z directions, respec-
tively. In both systems, the diffusions in the perpendicular direction (Z -axis) was lower than in the plane.
However, the values for the SPAN80 were higher than for the SDS surfactant, suggesting that the second
surfactant had a higher mobility than the ﬁrst one. It is worthy to mention that these diffusions were
much lower than the diffusions found for the same molecules on a Titanium dioxide surface [22, 23].

4. Conclusions and discussion

A series of Molecular Dynamics simulations were carried out in order to describe the behaviour of
two different surfactant molecules interacting with a silicon dioxide solid surface. In the case of the an-
ionic surfactant (SDS), there was observed a spherical micelle formation on a layer of water molecules

13602-6

Anionic and nonionic surfactants at the SiO2/water interface

previously adsorbed on the solid. The micelle was described by density proﬁles and they showed a defor-
mation of the micelle next to the adsorbed layer of water molecules. This deformation can be explained
in terms of the SDS charged headgroups interactions with water molecules on the solid surface. On the
other hand, the nonionic surfactant (SPAN80) did not show much inﬂuence by the solid surface. It formed
a cilyndrical micelle next to the adsorbed water layer. In this case, there was observed a thicker water
layer between the surfactant and the solid surface. The inﬂuence of the surfactant on the surface was
characterized by water molecules in the surface. Dipole water orientation, in the solid surface, was more
tilted for the SDS molecules than for the SPAN80 suggesting a stronger SDS-surface interaction and con-
sequently more intensive adsorption of those molecules on the surface. Based on the previous results
(diffusion coeﬃcients), it was noted that both surfactants showed less aﬃnity with the SiO2 surface than
with other surfaces such as graphite and titanium dioxide.
