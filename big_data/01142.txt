Abstract

In this work we introduce a new method of a ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) detection from thin, nm-size, ﬁlms. Our
setup is based on the commercial piezo-cantilever, used for atomic force microscopy. It has an option to rotate the sample
in the magnetic ﬁeld and it operates up to the high microwave frequencies of 160 GHz. Using our cantilever based FMR
spectrometer we have investigated a set of samples, namely quasi-bulk and 84 nm ﬁlm Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 samples, 16
nm Fe50Ni50 ﬁlm and 150 nm Sr2FeMoO6 ﬁlm. The high frequency ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) response from an
extremely thin Fe50Ni50 ﬁlm we have ﬁtted with the conventional model for the magnetization dynamics. The cantilever
detected FMR experiments on Sr2FeMoO6 ﬁlm reveal an inability of the conventional model to ﬁt frequency and angular
dependences with the same set of parameters, which suggests that one has to take into account much more complicated
nature of the magnetization precession in the Sr2FeMoO6 at low temperatures and high frequencies. Moreover, the
complicated dynamics of the magnetization apparent in all investigated samples is suggested by a drastic increase of
the linewidths with increasing microwave frequency, and by an emergence of the second line with an opposite angular
dependence.

1. Introduction

A key property of many intensively studied materials
is a magnetic anisotropy, which is deﬁned by the com-
plex interplay of diﬀerent degrees of freedom, such as spin
or/and orbital moments, charge and lattice. In particular,
in the ferromagnets promising for spintronic application,
such as Sr2FeMoO6 [1, 2] and Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 [3, 4], mag-
netic anisotropy deﬁnes the thermal stability of the mag-
netization. One of the most appropriate methods to study
magnetic anisotropies, as well as gyromagnetic ratios and
magnetization dynamics in ferromagnets is ferromagnetic
resonance (FMR).

Potential halfmetallic ferromagnetic materials has been
already studied by means of ferromagnetic resonance. In
most cases the study was limited to room temperatures
and low frequencies of standard spectrometers [5, 6, 7],
whereas there are also measurements performed using vec-
tor network analysers and microstrip resonators at fre-
quencies up to 70 GHz [8, 9, 10]. Additionally there are

few reports of measurements at even higher frequencies
[11]. Increasing a measurement frequency in the FMR ex-
periment is very important, since it yields a higher res-
olution and, therefore, better determination of g-factors
and magnetic anisotropies. Unfortunately high-frequency
measurements are associated with several problems in the
detection of the FMR signal, especially when performing
measurements on thin, nm-size, ﬁlms. Namely, in order to
increase the sensitivity one has to apply restrictions on the
microwave frequency, or strength and orientation of mag-
netic ﬁeld. For instance, standard resonators that amplify
the microwave power at the sample and drastically increase
the sensitivity, are often used only in a narrow frequency
range.

In this work ﬁrst we introduce a new method of de-
tecting ferromagnetic resonance from thin, nm-size, ﬁlms,
where all the restrictions named above are lifted. Our
setup, which is based on the measurement of the deﬂec-
tion of a µm-size piezo-cantilever, has an option to change
the angle between magnetic ﬁeld and the ﬁlm plane, and
it works up to the high microwave frequencies of 160 GHz.
Using this setup we investigated a set of selected materials,
namely quasi-bulk Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5, 84 nm Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5

We have measured high frequency ferromagnetic resonance
response from an extremely thin Fe50Ni50 ﬁlm and ﬁtted
it with the conventional model for the magnetization dy-
namics [12, 13]. The cantilever detected FMR experiments
on Sr2FeMoO6 ﬁlm reveal an inability of the conventional
model to ﬁt frequency and angular dependences with the
same set of parameters, which suggests that one has to
take into account much more complicated nature of the
magnetization precession in the Sr2FeMoO6 at low tem-
peratures and high frequencies. Moreover, the complicated
dynamics of the magnetization apparent in all the inves-
tigated samples is supported by a drastic increase of the
linewidths with increasing microwave frequency, and by
the emergence of the second line with an opposite angular
dependence.

3. Experimental setup

Polycrystalline Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 bulk sample was cast
by arc-melting stoichiometric quantities of at least 4N pure
constituents. Before melting the sample itself, the cham-
ber was evacuated to 10−5 mbar pressure before backﬁlling
with argon followed by melting a Ti piece in order to min-
imize oxygen. In order to achieve good homogeneity, the
sample was ﬂipped and re-melted 4 times. Resulting cast
sample was then sealed in an evacuated quartz ampoule
and subsequently annealed at 1400 K for 3 days followed
by slow-cooling. The annealed sample was mechanically
grinded to a thin plate of ∼17 µm.

Epitaxial 84 nm Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 ﬁlm was grown on
MgAl2O4 (001) substrate by oﬀ-axis sputtering in a UHV
system with a base pressure as low as 9.5·10−11 mbar us-
ing ultra-pure Ar (99.9999%) as sputtering gas. Optimal
quality Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 epitaxial ﬁlm was obtained at an
Ar pressure of 6·10−3 mbar, a substrate temperature of
600◦C, and DC sputtering at a constant current of 12 mA,
which results in a deposition rate of 5.6 ˚A/min [14, 15].

The deposition of 16 nm Fe50Ni50 ﬁlm was performed
using an e-gun in ultra high vacuum (UHV) with pressure
10−9 mbar on the MgO(100) substrate at a temperature
Tsub = 300 K [16]. The deposition rate was set to be 30
˚A/min.

Epitaxial Sr2FeMoO6 ﬁlms of 150 nm thickness were
grown on SrTiO3 (001) substrates in an ultrahigh vacuum
sputtering system with a base pressure of 6.5 · 10−10 mbar
using a stoichiometric Sr2FeMoO6 targets [17, 7]. Direct-
current (DC) magnetron sputtering was used for ﬁlm de-
position with a constant current of 5 mA in a pure Ar gas
(99.9995%) of 9·10−3 mbar, which resulted in a growth
rate of 0.84 ˚A/min. The ﬁlms were deposited in 90 o oﬀ-
axis geometry with the substrate temperature maintained
at 800◦C.

The present experimental setup is based on the can-
tilever detected ESR setup developed in the Molecular
Photoscience Research Center in Kobe University, Kobe,
Japan [18, 19, 20, 21]. The sample is glued directly to a
commercial piezo-cantilever [19, 21, 22]. The deﬂection of
the cantilever is measured by means of a bias box based on
the Wheatstone bridge, alternating voltage generator (G)
and diﬀerential ampliﬁer (DA) (Fig. 1(a)). The alternating
voltage generator (G) provides a voltage which feeds the
bridge. Rcanti is the cantilever with the sample, whereas
Rref is a reference unloaded cantilever [18, 19], which is
needed to cancel unwanted temperature and magnetic ﬁeld
eﬀects. Two variable resistances R1 and R2 are tuned in
order to equalize all the bridge resistances so that the volt-
age diﬀerence V2-V1 is equal to zero. When the ESR or
FMR absorption occurs, the cantilever is pulled by the
sample, which leads to a change of Rcanti, and therefore
to a change of the diﬀerence V2-V1. This change is de-
tected by a highly sensitive Lock-In ampliﬁer, which tracks
the signal at the reference frequency equal to a frequency
of the voltage generator G (Fig. 1(a)). Our experiments
showed that this frequency for the voltage modulation has
to be near the half of the eigenfrequency of the cantilever
to maximize the signal to noise ratio.

In order to check the sensitivity of the cantilever based
spectrometer we performed the following experiment. The
84 nm Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 thin ﬁlm sample glued to a can-
tilever was inserted into a cavity of the highly sensitive
commercial Bruker X-Band (9.56 GHz) EPR spectrome-
ter.
In this experiment, the signal at the X-Band spec-
trometer detector was recorded together with the signal
from piezocantilever while sweeping the magnetic ﬁeld at
room temperature. As can be seen in Fig. 2(a) the exper-
iment showed that both detection systems yield identical
FMR responses, and that the sensitivity of the piezocan-
tilever detection system is comparable to that of the X-
Band spectrometer from Bruker. Note that the Bruker
X-Band spectrometer is measuring the absorption deriva-

4. Model for analysis of the FMR results

 

To analyze the frequency and the angular dependences
of the measured spectra we have used a standard approach

tive, whereas the cantilever deﬂection represents a pure
absorption, which is depicted in Fig. 2(a).

It is important to bear in mind that during the can-
tilever detected FMR experiment we also measure a de-
ﬂection of the cantilever due to the magnetic anisotropy
of the sample. This is a very strong non-resonance ef-
fect, which depends on the sample magnetization and the
angle between ﬁlm plane and the applied magnetic ﬁeld.
Such cantilever deﬂection is the same with or without
the microwave radiation. Therefore there is a need to
subtract the background signal from such non-resonant
magnetic response. First option is to measure the can-
tilever response twice, ﬁrst time with the microwave source
switched on and second time with it switched oﬀ. Then
the latter measurement can be subtracted from the for-
mer one to get the pure FMR signal.
In this case the
drawback is that any drift of the background during both
measurements will be seen in the result of the subtrac-
tion. To avoid this and to make these two measurements
quasi-simultaneous, we have implemented a second modu-
lation, in this case the modulation of the microwave power
(on/oﬀ) at a low frequency of ∼ 0.2 Hz. The raw measure-
ment data are shown in Figure 2(b). As can be seen the
signal is oscillating with the second modulation frequency
(∼ 0.2 Hz), and the pure FMR response can be obtained
by subtracting the lower envelope of this signal from the
upper one.

High microwave frequency radiation was generated by a
set of Gunn oscillators from Millitech. The cantilever was
mounted on the probehead with in-situ sample rotation
mechanism, described elsewhere [20]. The probehead was
inserted into a magneto-cryostat from Oxford Instruments
with maximum magnetic ﬁeld of 15 T. The temperature

direction of the magnetization (applied magnetic ﬁeld

H is deﬁned as it is applied in the experiment, and the
angles θ and φ are found by numerical minimization of the

5.1. Overview of the high-frequency FMR response from

all investigated samples

As can be seen in Fig. 3(a) all the investigated thin
ﬁlms exhibit a rather strong FMR response at 8 K and
at the measurement microwave frequency of 120 GHz. All
the FMR signals consist of 2 lines, low (A) and high (B)
ﬁeld peaks. At this frequency lines are rather broad, with
the widths ranging from ∼1 T to ∼1.5 T for the ﬁrst peak,
and from ∼1.2 T to ∼2.1 T for the second peak, respec-
tively. These values were obtained by ﬁtting FMR signals
with two Lorentzian lines, respective ﬁts are shown in the
same Fig. 3(a) as solid lines. Interestingly, the linewidths
measured at high frequencies using cantilever detection

are much larger then those measured at low frequencies
using Bruker X-Band spectrometer, this is especially no-
ticeable in the case of Fe50Ni50 ﬁlm (see spectra in Fig.
4). Such a drastic increase of the linewidths with increas-
ing microwave frequency at low temperatures remains an
open question, but most likely points to the complicated
dynamics of the magnetization apparent in all the inves-
tigated samples. As has been shown, the linewidth in the
case of FMR is deﬁned by the complex interplay of dif-
ferent mechanisms, including Gilbert damping, mosaicity,
two magnon scaterring, etc. (Ref.
[8, 23] and references
therein), and therefore needs a further investigations with-
out restrictions in frequencies and temperatures.

The angular dependence of the FMR response shows
a peculiar behavior for the second line B (Fig. 3(b)).
Whereas the line A shifts to higher ﬁelds, as expected for
FMR signal when magnetic ﬁeld is rotated from the plane
of the ﬁlm (θH = 90 o, Fig. 1(b)) towards perpendicular
direction (θH = 0 o), the second one shifts to lower ﬁelds.
Therefore the more intensive ﬁrst line (A), or at least its
resonance position, we can attribute to a uniform preces-
sion mode, and the second line (B) is another mode excited
in the sample, possibly perpendicular standing spin wave
mode [24] excited at such high frequencies. Due to the
unclear nature of the high ﬁeld peak B, we will focus on
the analysis of the low ﬁeld line A with expected angular
dependence.

Comparing the Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 thin ﬁlm FMR signal1
to the one from a quasi-bulk (17 µm - thick) sample (see
Fig. 3(c)), we see that qualitatively the shape of the FMR
signal remains the same, although the details, such as res-

sured at 120 GHz and 160 GHz were detected by the cantilever de-

spectrometer, here the integral is shown. The angular dependences

ulated curves are shown in the inset.

onance positions and the linewidths of the individual lines
A and B are diﬀerent. Interestingly, the linewidth is some-
what smaller in the case of 17 µm - thick plate. This
suggests that such double-line shape is not only due to
a small thickness of the measured ﬁlms, but also repre-
sents an intrinsic eﬀect related to the high frequency of
the excitation. As can be seen in Fig. 5(b) in the case
of Sr2FeMoO6 sample, the frequency when the second line
becomes apparent should be above ∼ 60 GHz.

5.2. FMR measurements on Fe50Ni50 16 nm ﬁlm

In the case of Fe50Ni50 ﬁlm two spectra were mea-
sured at 120 GHz and 160 GHz at the temperature of
8 K and with external magnetic ﬁeld lying in the ﬁlm
plane (Fig. 4). In addition two angular dependences were
measured by Bruker X-Band spectrometer at 9.56 GHz,
one at room temperature, and another at 3.47 K (see in-
set in Fig. 4). Fitting the high frequency FMR response
with two Lorentzian lines we were able to extract the res-
onance positions of both peaks, which are shown together
with respective spectra in Fig. 4. Using the model de-
scribed in the Section 4, we have ﬁtted the frequency vs
resonance ﬁeld dependence for the magnetic ﬁeld being in
the ﬁlm plane and the angular dependence measured at
the X-band frequency of 9.56 GHz and T = 3.47 K si-
multaneously. The ﬁt, which is shown in Fig. 4 as solid
lines, yields γ/2π = 28 GHz/T, cubic anisotropy constant
Kc = −5 · 105 erg cm−3 and uniaxial anisotropy constant
KU = −125 · 106 erg cm−3. The negative sign and sig-
niﬁcant value of KU points to the fact that Fe50Ni50 has
an easy plane anisotropy, which can be explained by the
noticeable lattice mismatch between Fe50Ni50 (a = 3.578

sidering a rather small ﬁlm thickness of 16 nm.
Impor-
tantly, reducing only the uniaxial anisotropy constant to
the vale of KU = −10 · 106 erg cm−3 in our simulations,
we can ﬁt the room temperature angular dependence mea-
sured at the frequency of 9.56 GHz. Such drastic increase
of the anisotropy constants with decreasing temperature
has been reported before [27] and explained by the collec-
tive change of the lattice parameters and the total magne-
tization with changing temperature.

5.3. FMR measurements on Sr2FeMoO6 150 nm ﬁlm

Besides the angular dependence measured at a fre-
quency of 120 GHz and temperature of 8 K (see Fig. 3(b))
we have measured a frequency dependence of the FMR sig-
nal with magnetic ﬁeld lying in the ﬁlm plane (Fig.5(a)).
The ﬁt with two Lorentzian lines described before yields a
frequency vs resonance ﬁeld diagram for both peaks, shown
in Fig.5(b). Using the model described in the Section 4, we
have ﬁtted this frequency vs resonance ﬁeld dependence of
the low ﬁeld peak. The result of the ﬁt is depicted as solid
line. The saturation magnetization value for the equations
1 and 2 was taken from the static magnetometry measure-
ments and is equal Ms = 1.5µB/F.U. This ﬁt yields the
gyromagnetic ratio γ/2π = 29.4 GHz/T, cubic anisotropy
constant Kc = −1.5 · 105 erg cm−3 and uniaxial anisotropy
constant KU = −22.5 ·106 erg cm−3. The γ value is typical
for Sr2FeMoO6 and agrees well with previous reports [6].
In addition, we have measured the angular dependences
of the FMR response at two temperatures, T = 4 K and
T = 295 K, using commercial Bruker X-band spectrome-
ter (ν = 9.56 GHz). Representative spectra are shown in

Fig. 6(a). The lines are rather broad, especially at T = 4
K. To obtain the resonance positions we have integrated
all the spectra and picked all the resonance ﬁelds at the
maxima of these integrals. These resonance positions are
shown in Fig. 6(b) as a function of the angle θH together
with the resonance positions measured at ν = 120 GHz
using cantilever detected FMR setup.

Taking the γ value and the anisotropy constants ob-
tained from the frequency vs resonance ﬁeld dependence
ﬁt, we have simulated the low temperature angular depen-
dences measured at ν = 9.56 GHz and ν = 120 GHz. As
can be seen in Fig. 6(b), the simulated curves reproduce
rather well the measured dependences at the angles near
θH = 90◦, but strongly deviate at smaller angles. Interest-
ingly, the angular dependence measured at ν = 9.56 GHz,
at the room temperature, can be almost perfectly ﬁtted
with the gyromagnetic ratio γ/2π = 29.4 GHz/T and uni-
axial anisotropy constant KU = −4 · 106 erg cm−3, which
is noticeably smaller then its low temperature value. Such
inability to ﬁnd common parameters to ﬁt all the data,
like in the case of Fe50Ni50 ﬁlm, suggests that the model
has to be reconsidered, taking into account much more
complicated nature of the magnetization precession in the
Sr2FeMoO6 at low temperatures and high microwave fre-
quencies.

6. Summary

In the present work we have introduced a new method
for the detection of the ferromagnetic resonance of the
samples with the thickness from 17 µm down to 16 nm. It
is based on the deﬂection of the cantilever, which occurs at

the ferromagnetic resonance. In order to increase the sensi-
tivity we have implemented a double modulation, namely,
we modulate the voltage at the Wheatstone bridge and the
output of the microwave source at the same time. Using
this setup we have investigated a set of samples: quasi-bulk
and 84 nm ﬁlm Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 sample, 16 nm Fe50Ni50
ﬁlm and 150 nm Sr2FeMoO6 ﬁlm. Low frequency test of
our setup using a standard Bruker X-Band spectrometer
showed identical FMR signals detected by the cantilever
deﬂection and by the Bruker X-band detector simultane-
ously. We have measured a high frequency ferromagnetic
resonance (FMR) response from an quite thin Fe50Ni50
ﬁlm and successfully ﬁtted the resonance positions of the
low ﬁeld FMR lines together with the low frequency mea-
surements using the conventional model for the magnetiza-
tion dynamics. The cantilever detected FMR experiments
on Sr2FeMoO6 ﬁlm revealed an inability of the conven-
tional model to perfectly ﬁt both frequency and angular
dependences of the FMR signal with the same values of
γ, KU and Kc, which suggests that one has to take into
account much more complicated nature of the magnetiza-
tion precession in the Sr2FeMoO6 at low temperatures and
high frequencies. Moreover, the complicated dynamics of
the magnetization apparent in all the investigated samples
is supported by a drastic increase of the linewidths with in-
creasing microwave frequency, and by the emergence of the
second line with an opposite angular dependence. These
large linewidths and the emergence of the second lines re-
main an open question.
