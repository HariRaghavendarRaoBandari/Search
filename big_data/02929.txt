Abstract

We characterize the long-time behaviour of solutions to Smoluchowski’s coagulation
equation with a diagonal kernel of homogeneity γ < 1. Due to the property of the
diagonal kernel, the value of a solution depends only on a discrete set of points. As
a consequence, the long-time behaviour of solutions is in general periodic, oscillating
between diﬀerent rescaled versions of a self-similar solution. Immediate consequences
of our result are a characterization of the set of data for which the solution converges
to self-similar form and a uniqueness result for self-similar proﬁles.

Introduction

Smoluchowski’s classical coagulation equation provides a mean-ﬁeld description of binary
coalescence of clusters. If ξ denotes the size of a cluster and F (τ, ξ) the corresponding
number density at time τ then the equation is given by

∂τ F (τ, ξ) =

K(ξ−η, η)F (τ, ξ−η)F (τ, η)dη

K(ξ, η)F (τ, ξ)F (τ, η)dη ,

ξ > 0, τ > 0 ,

where the rate kernel K = K(ξ, η) describes the rate at which clusters of size ξ and η
coagulate. This model has been used in various applications, most prominently in aerosol
physics or polymerization, but also in astrophysics or population dynamics for example
[2, 1].
We are in the following interested in kernels that grow at most sublinearly at inﬁnity. In
this case it is well-known for a large class of kernels that if the initial data F (0, ξ) have

A topic of particular interest in the theory of coagulation is whether solutions to (1) evolve
for large times in a self-similar fashion. This is however only well-understood for the so-
called solvable kernels K(ξ, η) = const., K(ξ, η) = ξ +η and K(ξ, η) = ξη, since in this case
equation (1) can be solved explicitly by transform methods. A complete characterization
of the long-time behaviour of solutions to (1) with solvable kernels can be found in [8].
For all other kernels there are so far only numerical studies available [6, 4] that suggest for
a range of kernels convergence to self-similar form in the long-time limit. In subsequent
years several results established also rigorously the existence of self-similar solutions, both
with ﬁnite mass and with fat tails [5, 3, 10, 9], but an analysis of the long-time behaviour
of solutions is still elusive.
In the present paper we study a speciﬁc kernel that is in some sense orthogonal to the
constant kernel, the so-called diagonal kernel. It is given by

K (ξ, η) = ξ1+γδ (ξ−η) ,

γ < 1 ,

that is in this model only clusters of the same size can coagulate. Then equation (1)
reduces to

∂τ F (τ, ξ) =

ξ1+γ
23+γ F 2 (τ, ξ/2) − ξ1+γF 2 (τ, ξ) .

(3)

Obviously a key diﬀerence to continuous kernels is the fact that for the diagonal one
the evolution in a point ξ depends only on smaller values, but not on larger ones. As
a consequence, the equation obeys a maximum principle, a fact that we will also use in
our analysis. Another key feature is that the evolution in ξ depends only on a discrete
set of values of the form ξ/2k and thus the evolution decouples in a certain sense which
leads to a long-time behaviour of solutions that is diﬀerent from what can be expected for
continuous kernels. We will explain this in more detail in Section 2.2 below.

2 Main results

2.1 Reformulation of the problem

It turns out to be more convenient to go over to the function

G(τ, η) = 2η(1+γ)F (τ, ξ)

with ξ = 2η , η ∈ R .

Then we obtain that G satisﬁes

∂τ G =

1
21−γ G2(τ, η−1) − G2(τ, η)

(4)

3

and

ZR

2(1−γ)ηG(τ, η) dη = ZR

2(1−γ)ηG0(η) dη

for all τ > 0 .

(5)

Well-posedness of this equation for data in L∞(R+) will be shown later for a reformulated
problem in Lemma 3.1.
We expect to have as special solutions to (3) self-similar solutions, which means for (4)
rescaled traveling wave solutions of the form G(τ, η) = τ −1H(η − ln τ
(1−γ) ln 2 ). In order to
study the existence of such special solutions and the large time behaviour of solutions to
(4) we introduce the new variables

α := (1−γ) ln 2 ,

t =

ln τ
α

,

x = η −

ln τ
α

and G(τ, η) = αe−αth(t, x)

(6)

such that we obtain

and

∂th = ∂xh + αh + e−αh2(x−1) − h2(x)

ZR

eαxh(t, x) dx = ZR

eαxh0(x) dx .

(7)

(8)

A self-similar solution to (3) corresponds now to a stationary solution ¯h of (7), that is, to
a solution of

0 = ∂x¯h + α¯h + e−α¯h2(x−1) − ¯h2(x) .

(9)
Notice that the equation is invariant under a shift, that is if ¯h is a solution, then so is
¯hλ(x) := ¯h(x + λ). We are interested in solutions ¯h to (9) that are nonnegative, locally
integrable and such that RR eαx¯h(x) dx < ∞. By shifting ¯h we can normalize the mass
RR eαx¯h(x) dx. Notice also that it follows directly from local integrability that ¯h ∈ C 1(R).
It has also been proved in [7] by a shooting method that for any a > 0 there exists a
nonnegative solution ¯ha to (9) that is bounded, decreasing and satisﬁes

lim

x→−∞

2−σx(cid:16)¯ha(x) −

α

1−e−α(cid:17) = −a

(10)

where σ is the only positive root of the equation (1+ln 2σ/α)(1−e−α) = 2(1−e−α2−σ). The

constant a is just a normalization and corresponds to rescaling the mass RR eαx¯ha(x) dx.
Furthermore, the function ¯ha satisﬁes
0 < ¯ha(x) ≤ C exp(cid:16) − L2x(cid:17)

for some C = Ca > 0, L = La > 0 .

(11)

Our goal in this paper is to study the behaviour of solutions to (7) as t → ∞. As a
consequence of our results we will also obtain that stationary solutions are unique up to
rescaling.

2.2 Main results

A key property of the diagonal kernel is that the evolution of h(t, x) depends only on
the discrete sets of values x − k, k ∈ Z. Correspondingly, one of the key points of the
argument used in this paper is a decomposition of the plane {(t, x) : t ∈ R, x ∈ R} in a
family of lines whose evolution under (7) is mutually decoupled.
Given θ ∈ [0, 1)we deﬁne the following family of lines.

Sθ = {(t, x) : x = k + θ − t , k ∈ Z , t ∈ R} .

Obviously for given θ1, θ2 ∈ [0, 1) with θ1 6= θ2 we have Sθ1 ∩ Sθ2 = ∅ and R × R =
Sθ∈[0,1) Sθ. Hence, the following function Θ is well-deﬁned.
Deﬁnition 2.1. We deﬁne the function Θ : R × R → [0, 1) as the unique θ = Θ (t, x) such
that (t, x) ∈ SΘ(t,x), that is Θ(t, x) = t + x − ⌊t + x⌋.
Notice that the function Θ is 1-periodic in both variables, that is

Θ (t + 1, x) = Θ (t, x) ,

Θ (t, x) = Θ (t, x − 1) ,

(t, x) ∈ R × R .

(12)

We also deﬁne the function

ψ(t, θ) = t − θ − ⌊t − θ⌋ ∈ [0, 1) ,

t ≥ 0, θ ∈ [0, 1) .

(13)

Notice that in particular ψ(0, θ) = 1 − θ and that at times tn = n + θ, n ∈ N ∪ {0} the
function ψ jumps from 1 to 0. With deﬁnition (13) we have that if x ∈ (k, k + 1], then

(14)
In the following let ¯h ∈ C 1(R) be a nonnegative solution to (9) with the properties (10)
and (11) and with mass normalized to one, that is

x = k + 1 − ψ(t, Θ(t, x)) .

1 = ZR

eαx¯h(x) dx = Z 1

0 nXk∈Z

eα(k+θ)¯h(k + θ)o dθ .

(15)

As pointed out above, the evolution decouples into an evolution for each ’ﬁbre’ θ ∈ [0, 1).
We will see that the long-time behaviour of the solution to (7) is determined by the mass
of the initial data in each ﬁbre, given by

m0(θ) := Xk∈Z

eα(k+θ)h0(k + θ) .

(16)

More precisely, we will see that a solution of (7) in each ﬁbre is for large times approximated
by the stationary solution with the same mass. In that connection we notice that a simple

computation, using (9), implies that ν := Pk∈Z eα(k+θ)¯h(k + θ) is independent of θ and
with the normalization (15) one obtains that ν = 1. In order to obtain the stationary
solution with mass m0(θ) we need to shift ¯h. We see that

m0(θ) = Xk∈Z

eαk¯h(k − λ)

if and only if

λ =

ln m0(θ)

α

.

(17)

We can now formulate our main results.

Theorem 2.2. Consider the solution h(t, x) of (7) with initial data h0 ∈ L∞(R), h0 ≥ 0
with m0 ∈ L1(0, 1), where m0 is deﬁned in (16). Then we have with

µ(t, x) :=

ln(cid:0)m0(cid:0)Θ(t, x)(cid:1)(cid:1)

that

ZR

eαx(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

h(t, x) − ¯h(cid:0)x − µ(t, x)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

dx → 0

as t → ∞ .

Theorem 2.2 provides a detailed description of the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to
(7) as t → ∞ and in particular implies that the long-time behaviour is in general periodic.
It also characterizes the class of initial data with ﬁnite mass that yield a traveling wave
solution (resp. self-similar solution in the original variables) as t → ∞.

Corollary 2.3. We have convergence to a stationary solution, if and only if the function
m0(θ) as deﬁned (16) is constant almost everywhere in [0, 1).

Another consequence of Theorem 2.2 is the fact that stationary solutions of (7) are unique
up to rescaling.
Corollary 2.4. Let ¯h1, ¯h2 be two nonnegative solutions to (9). Then there exists µ ∈ R
such that ¯h1(x) = ¯h2(x − µ).

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 3, which is the core of our
paper, contains the proof of Theorem 2.2 and consists of several Lemmas. The key idea
is that we can construct a Lyapunov functional for the evolution in each ﬁbre that gives
a contractivity property in a weighted L1 norm (see Lemma 3.3). Another key auxiliary
result is a tightness property that we prove in Lemma 3.2. This in turn allows to obtain
a lower bound for the dissipation functional in Lemma 3.4. All these results are proved
pointwise in the sense that we prove them for each ﬁbre. Keeping track of the dependence
of the rate of convergence on all the parameters ﬁnally allows us to deduce Theorem 2.2
from these pointwise results. Corollary 2.3 is then a direct consequence of Theorem 2.2.
Finally, in order to apply Theorem 2.2 to deduce the uniqueness result Corollary 2.4 we
need an a-priori L∞ bound for arbitrary nonnegative solutions to (9). The corresponding
result Lemma 4.1 and the conclusion are the contents of Section 4.

3 Proof of Theorem 2.2

We ﬁrst introduce further suitable variables. For given θ ∈ [0, 1) such that m0(θ) ∈ (0, ∞)
we deﬁne the functions

ϕθ
k(t) := h(cid:0)t, k + 1 − ψ(t, θ)(cid:1)

where λ(θ) = ln m0(θ)
we have for x ∈ (k, k + 1] that

α

. We ﬁrst notice that ¯ϕθ

and

¯ϕθ

k(t) := ¯h(cid:0)k + 1 − λ(θ) − ψ(t, θ)(cid:1) ,

(18)

k is 1-periodic. Furthermore, recalling (14),

¯ϕΘ(t,x)
k

(t) = ¯h(cid:0)x − λ(cid:0)Θ(t, x)(cid:1)(cid:1)

(19)

and

ϕΘ(t,x)
k

(t) = h(t, x) .

6

(20)

The motivation for introducing these variables is as follows.
In order to get rid of the
transport term ∂xh in (7) we as usual go over to characteristics. However, then the
solution is continuously shifted to the right by the coagulation terms. Thus, in order
to keep the solution at scales of order 1, we shift the solution back to the left at times
n + θ, n ∈ N ∪ {0}.
It follows from (7) that

k(t) = αϕθ

k(t) = lim

We have Pk eα(k+θ)ϕθ

k(0) = m0(θ) and

eαkϕθ

k(t) = eα(ψ(t,θ)−1)m0(θ) .

Xk
k satisfy (21)-(23). Due to (11) we also have that ¯ϕθ

(23)

k ≤

We easily check that also ¯ϕθ

C exp(cid:0) − L2k(cid:1) as k → ∞.
We ﬁrst prove a well-posedness result for (21) that in particular gives a uniform bound on
ϕθ
k that is independent of θ.
Lemma 3.1. Let ϕθ(0) = (cid:16)ϕθ
and Pk eαkϕθ
C 0(cid:0)[0, ∞); l∞ ∩ l1(eαk)(cid:1) with ϕθ

Proof. Throughout this proof we neglect the dependence on θ in the notation.
For the proof it is convenient to go over to the variable ρk(t) := e−α(ψ(t)−1)ϕk(t). Then
we are looking for a solution of

If we denote MT := {ρ = (cid:0)ρk(cid:1) ∈ C 0([0, T ]; l1(eαk)(cid:1) | supk |ρk| ≤ 2C0} then it follows by

a standard ﬁxed point argument that there exists a unique solution to (25) in MT with

initial conditions ϕk(0) if T ∈ (0, θ) is suﬃciently small. Nonnegativity of the solution
follows from the maximum principle. In order to show that ρ satisﬁes (26) in [0, T ] we
compute

Integrating the previous inequality and letting M → ∞ we obtain that Pk eαkρk(t) ≤ m0
for all t ∈ [0, T ]. But this in turn implies that ρM ≤ m0e−αM and hence eαM ρ2
M → 0 as
M → ∞. Thus we ﬁnd (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
→ 0 as M → ∞ and as a consequence the

solution ρ satisﬁes (26).
It remains to show that (24) is satisﬁed in [0, T ] from which it follows that we can extend
the solution to the interval [0, θ]. We can then repeat the argument in all subsequent
intervals [n + θ, n + θ + 1).
To prove (24) we use a maximum principle argument. Indeed, recalling that ψ(t, θ) − 1 =
t − θ for t ∈ (0, θ), it follows from (25) that

k=−M eαkρk(t)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

for t ∈ [0, T ). Given ε > 0 we have that either ρk(t) < supj ρj(t) − ε in which case we
deduce from (27) that

Otherwise ρk(t) > supj ρj(t) − ε, then

ρk(t + δ) < sup

j

ρj(t) − ε + Cδ .

ρk(t + δ) ≤ ρk(t) − δeα(t−θ)(cid:0)1 − e−α(cid:1)(cid:0) sup

j

ρj(t)(cid:1)2 − Cε(cid:17) + Cδ2 .

If δ is suﬃciently small (depending on ε), it follows that

Taking the limits δ → 0 and then ε → 0, we obtain

which proves the claim.

To proceed, we set

and notice that by deﬁnition

Lθ(t) := Xk

eαk(cid:16)ϕθ

k(t) − ¯ϕθ

k(cid:17)+

Lθ((n + θ)−) = eαLθ((n + θ)+) .

8

(28)

(29)

Our goal is to show that Lθ(t) → 0 as t → ∞. This will follow from the fact, that Lθ is a
Lyapunov functional and that we can provide a lower bound on the dissipation functional.
Towards that aim we ﬁrst prove a tightness result

Lemma 3.2. Given ε > 0 and M = M (θ) > 0 such that Pk≥M eαkh0(k + θ) < ε. Then

there exists N = N (ε, M, m0(θ), kh0kL∞ ) such that

eαkϕθ

k(t) ≤ 2eαε

for all t.

X|k|≥N

(30)

Proof. Within this proof we again neglect the dependence on θ in the notation.
We ﬁrst notice that the uniform bound (24) implies that there exists N1 ∈ N such that

Pk≤−N1

eαkϕk(s) ≤ ε.

In order to control the mass at large positive k we construct a supersolution for the
quantiles. More precisely, we deﬁne

Qk(t) := Xℓ≥k

eαℓϕℓ(t)

and

¯Qk(t) := Xℓ≥k

eαℓ ¯ϕℓ−ℓ0 + εeαψ(t)

with some suﬃciently large ℓ0 ∈ Z that will be determined later. Then Qk solves

d
dt

Qk = αQk + e−α(k−1)(cid:16)Qk−1 − Qk(cid:17)2

and ¯Qk solves the same equation. Furthermore, by (22) we have Qk((n + θ)−) =
eαQk−1((n+θ)+) and we observe that Qk → m0 as k → −∞ as well as ¯Qk → eα(l0+ψ(t))m0+
εeαψ(t) as k → −∞.
For the diﬀerence Wk := ¯Qk − Qk we obtain

d
dt

Wk = αWk + e−α(k−1)Wk−1(cid:0) ¯Qk−1 − ¯Qk + Qk−1 − Qk(cid:1)
and since Qk, ¯Qk are decreasing in k we have ¯Qk−1 − ¯Qk + Qk−1 − Qk ≥ 0.
We now choose l0 = l0(M, m0) so large such that

(31)

¯Qk(0) ≥ 2m0 ≥ Qk(0)

for all k ≤ M .

We also have

¯Qk(0) ≥ ε ≥ Qk(0)

for all k > M .

9

Now we choose N2 so large such that

¯Qk ≤ (cid:0)2eα − 1(cid:1)ε

for all k ≥ N2 and t > 0 .

The latter is possible due to the deﬁnition of ¯ϕk in (18).
Suppose now that t0 is the ﬁrst time and k0 the smallest integer such that Wk0(t0) = 0.
Since limk→−∞ Wk(t) > m0 we have that k0 > −∞. But then (31) implies that d
dt Wk0(t0)
which gives a contradiction and choosing N = max(N1, N2) ﬁnishes the proof.

Lemma 3.3. We have

d
dt

Lθ(t) = αLθ(t) − Dθ(t)

for t ∈ (n + θ, n + θ + 1)

with

Dθ(t) = Xk
k − ¯ϕθ

where wθ

k = ϕθ

eαk(cid:0)ϕθ

k(t) + ¯ϕθ

k(t)(cid:1)wθ

k(t)(cid:0)χwθ

k>0 − χwθ

k+1>0(cid:1) ≥ 0 ,

Proof. This is a simple explicit computation.

Lemma 3.4. Let 0 < c1 ≤ m0(θ) ≤ c2 < ∞, let ε > 0 be suﬃciently small and let N be
such that (30) holds.
Then there exists ν = ν(c1, c2, N ) > 0 such that as long as Lm(s) ≥ 16eαε we have

Z n+θ+1

n+θ

Dθ(t) dt ≥ ν .

Proof. Throughout this proof we again neglect the dependence of the functions on θ.
We recall that the functions ϕk solve (21), satisfy the uniform bound (24), the mass
equation (23) and the tightness estimate (30) as well as L(s) ≥ 16eαε. We denote the set
of functions that satisfy all these conditions M.
We assume now that there exists a sequence pm
n+θ Dm(t) dt → 0,
where Dm is the dissipation function evaluated at pm
k . Then we can extract a subsequence,
again denoted by pm
k → pk uniformly in [n + θ, n + θ + 1) for all
k. Furthermore, pk satisﬁes all the properties of the set M except possibly (23) and the
lower bound on Lm(s). However, due to the tightness property (30), we still have with
wk := pk − ¯ϕk that

k ∈ M such that R n+θ+1

k , and pk such that pm

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Xk

as well as

eαkpk(s) − eα(ψ(t)−1)m0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

and

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) X|k|≤N

eαkwk(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

≤ 4eαε

(32)

eαk(cid:0)wk(cid:1)+ ≥ 8eαε .

(33)

By construction we have with wm

k := pm

(35)

B(pk, pk+1) = eαk(cid:0)pk(t) + ¯ϕk(t)(cid:1)wk(t)(cid:0)χwk>0 − χwk+1>0(cid:1) .

It remains to take the limit in (34). Notice that the nonnegativity of the terms B(pk, pk+1)
implies that

lim

B(pk, pk+1) dt = 0

(36)

A careful examination of all the cases shows that the function B is continuous at the
points where the limit function w satisﬁes one of the following properties

[wk ≥ 0, wk+1 > 0] , [wk ≥ 0, wk+1 < 0] , [wk ≤ 0, wk+1 > 0] , [wk ≤ 0, wk+1 < 0] ,

(37)

It only remains to consider the set of points where either wk > 0 or wk < 0 and wk+1 = 0.
It is readily seen that in the case

[wk < 0, wk+1 = 0]

the functions (pk, pk+1) 7→ B(pk, pk+1) are lower semicontinuous.
We will denote as Gk the set of times t ∈ [n + θ, n + θ + 1) where one of the cases in (37),
(38) holds. We will then write Bk = [n + θ, n + θ + 1)(cid:31)Gk. Then, (36) implies

for t ∈ (n + θ, n + θ + 1). Taking the limit we obtain that also wk satisﬁes (40). Notice that
for the set of times t ∈ Bk we have wk(t) > 0, wk+1(t) = 0. Using (40) with k replaced
by k + 1 we obtain wk(τ ) > 0, wk+1(τ ) > 0 for τ ∈ (t, t + δ), with δ > 0. Then, for any
s ∈ Bk there exists an interval (t, t + δ) ⊂ Gk, with δ depending on s. This implies that
|Bk| = 0 and therefore (39) reduces to

0 = X|k|≤N

B (pk(t), pk+1(t)) dt .

(41)

We will now show that such functions ϕk and the corresponding wk as constructed above
cannot exist.

To this end we distinguish diﬀerent cases. Suppose ﬁrst that there exists t∗ ∈ [n +
θ, n + θ + 1) such that w−N (t∗) > 0. Due to (32) and (33) there is k0 with |k0| < N
such that wk0(t∗) < 0. Let k∗ ∈ [−N, k0] be the largest integer such that wk(t∗) > 0 if
−N1 ≤ k ≤ k∗, wk∗+1(t∗) ≤ 0. Due to (40) we obtain similar inequalities in a time interval
t ∈ [t∗ − δ, t∗]. Using (35) it follows that R n+θ+1
n+θ B(pk∗, pk∗+1) ds > 0, but this contradicts

(41).
Suppose now that w−N1(t) ≤ 0 for all t ∈ [n + θ, n + θ + 1). We ﬁx any value t∗ ∈
[n + θ, n + θ + 1) and distinguish two subcases. Due to (32), (33) there exist k1 < k2
such that sgn(wk1(t∗)) 6= sgn(wk2(t∗)). We have two subcases. Suppose ﬁrst that at the
ﬁrst k1 ≥ −N1 where wk1(t∗) 6= 0 we have wk1(t∗) > 0. We then argue as in the case
w−N1(t∗) > 0 to obtain a contradiction. Suppose then that wk1(t∗) < 0. Let k2 > k1
such that wk(t∗) ≤ 0, for k ≤ k2 ≤ N1, wk2+1(t∗) > 0. Then, since wk1(t∗) < 0 we
obtain, using (40) that wk(t) < 0, for k ≤ k2, wk2+1(t) > 0, s ∈ (s∗, s∗ + δ) . (Notice
that this argument is basically a discrete version of Hopf’s Lemma). It then follows that
R n+θ+1
n+θ B (pk2−1(t), pk2 (t)) dt > 0, whence a contradiction follows. This concludes the
proof.

Lemma 3.5. With Lθ(t) as in (28) we have

Lθ(t) → 0

as t → ∞.

Proof. As a consequence of Lemmas 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 we obtain for a constant ν that is
independent of the times m that

Lθ(cid:0)(n + θ + 1)−(cid:1) ≤ Lθ(cid:0)(n + θ)+(cid:1)eα − ν .

Since Lθ(cid:0)(n + θ + 1)−(cid:1) = eαLθ(cid:0)(n + θ + 1)+(cid:1) we obtain that Lθ(t) is decreasing and

after a ﬁnite time becomes smaller than 16eαε. Since ε > 0 was arbitrary, this proves the
Lemma.

As a consequence of these considerations we obtain

Corollary 3.6. Let θ ∈ [0, 1) such that 0 ≤ c1 ≤ m0(θ) ≤ c2 < ∞. Let ε > 0 and suppose

that Pk≥M eαkh0(k + θ) ≤ ε. Then there exists T = T (ε, M, c1, c2, kh0kL∞) such that

≤ 32eαε

for t ≥ T .

Proof. By Lemma 3.2 there exists N = N(cid:0)ε, M, c1, c2, kh0kL∞(cid:1) such that P|k|≥N eαkϕθ
2eαε for all t. By Lemma 3.4 there exists T = T (ε, M, c1, c2, kh0kL∞) such that Lθ(t) ≤
16eαε for t ≥ T . Hence, since by construction Pk eαk(cid:0)ϕθ
k(t)(cid:1) = 0 for all t, we
k(t)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ 32eαε and the claim follows, recalling the deﬁnitions in
obtain Pk eαk(cid:12)(cid:12)ϕθ

k(t) − ¯ϕθ

Proof of Theorem 2.2. For parameters δ, ε, K and M we deﬁne the following sets

A1(K) := {θ ∈ [0, 1) : m0(θ) ≥ K}
A2(δ) := {θ ∈ [0, 1) : m0(θ) ≤ δ}

A3(ε, M ) := nθ ∈ [0, 1) : Xk≥M

eα(k+θ)h0(k + θ) ≥ εo

Then, recalling (14),

and since the left hand side in (43) converges to zero as M → ∞ it follows that |A3(ε, M )| →
0 as M → ∞ for ﬁxed ε. Then, since m0 ∈ L1(0, 1), we have

ZA1

m0(θ) dθ → 0

as K → ∞ and

m0(θ) dθ → 0

m0(θ) dθ(cid:17) ≤ ε .

Then, by Corollary 3.6, we can ﬁnd a suﬃciently large T = T (ε, δ, K, M ) such that

4 A priori estimates for stationary solutions

Lemma 4.1. Let ¯h ∈ C 1(R) be a nonnegative solution to (9) with the property that
RR eαx¯h(x) dx < ∞. Then ¯h ∈ L∞(R).
Proof. Step 1: We ﬁrst claim that the function ¯h satisﬁes

eαx¯h(x) = Z x

x−1

¯h2(t)eαt dt

for all x ∈ R .

To prove (45), we ﬁrst multiply (9) by eαx and integrate to ﬁnd

eαx¯h(x) = Z x

x−1

¯h2(t)eαt dt + J

(45)

(46)

for some J ∈ R. Assume ﬁrst that J > 0. Then it follows from the nonnegativity of ¯h
that eαx¯h(x) ≥ J which contradicts RR eαx¯h(x) dx < ∞. Next, assume that J < 0. Then

(46) implies that

¯h2(t) dt .

(47)

|J| ≤ Z x

x−1

¯h2(t)eαt dt ≤ eαxZ x

x−1

Let x = n + 1 for n ∈ N. Then it follows from (47) that

|J|

eα(n+1)

≤ Z n+1

n

¯h2(t) dt .

As a consequence, there exists xn ∈ (n, n + 1) with

¯h2(xn) ≥

|J|

eα(n+1)

.

(48)

We are going to show that the diﬀerential equation for ¯h implies that ¯h is also large in a
suﬃciently large interval around xn. In fact, (9) implies that ∂x¯h ≤ ¯h2 and integrating
this equation gives

¯h(x) ≥ ¯h(xn) exp(cid:16) −Z x

x−1

¯h(t) dt(cid:17)

for x ∈ [xn−1, xn] .

(49)

For x ≥ 1 we have R x
¯h(t)eαt dt < ∞ and hence, combining (49) and (48)
we ﬁnd that there exists a constant d > 0 such that ¯h(x) ≥ de−nα/2 for x ∈ [xn−1, xn].
As a consequence, we obtain

¯h(t) dt ≤ RR

eαx¯h(x) dx ≥ Xn≥1

and hence a contradiction. This implies J = 0 and proves (45).

Step 2: There exists C > 0 such that ¯h(x) ≤ C for all x ∈ R.
Suppose on the contrary that there exists a sequence (xn) such that ¯h(xn) → ∞. Then,
given any M > 0 there exists xM such that ¯h(xM ) ≥ M . Then we have either

In case that (50) holds, it implies for y ∈ [xM + 1

Hence, if M is so large such that M 2
this procedure we ﬁnd ¯h(cid:0)xM + k
y ∈ [xM + k

2(cid:1) ≥ 2kM and ¯h(y) ≥ c02kM for some c0 > 0 for either

which gives a contradiction and hence proves the statement of the Lemma.

Proof of Corollary 2.4. Let ˜h ∈ C 1(R) be a nonnegative solution to (9). By Lemma 4.1 we
have ˜h ∈ L∞(R). Then ˜h is also a solution to the evolution equation (7) and by Theorem
2.2 we have

ZR

eαx(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

˜h(x) − ¯h(cid:0)x − µ(cid:0)Θ(t, x)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

→ 0

as t → ∞ .

Since ˜h is independent of t it follows that µ is independent of θ, which proves the claim.
