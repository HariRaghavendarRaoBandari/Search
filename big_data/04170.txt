Abstract

We consider implications of the microscopic dynamics of spacetime for the evolution of cosmo-

logical models. We argue that quantum geometry eﬀects may lead to stochastic ﬂuctuations of

the gravitational constant, which is thus considered as a macroscopic eﬀective dynamical quantity.

Consistency with Riemannian geometry entails the presence of a time-dependent dark energy term

in the modiﬁed ﬁeld equations, which can be expressed in terms of the dynamical gravitational

constant. We suggest that the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe may be ascribed

to quantum ﬂuctuations in the geometry of spacetime rather than the vacuum energy from the

matter sector.

It is unlikely that the geometry of spacetime remains unchanged all the way to microscop-

longer be neglected and geometry may altogether lose the meaning we are familiar with. The

spacetime structure at microscopic scales is of course not known, although some indications

from Noncommutative Geometry [1, 2], String Theory [3], or Loop Quantum Gravity [4]

are available. Even though a full theory of quantum spacetime is not yet available, it is

reasonable to assume that Einstein’s equations (as well as the ones of quantum ﬁeld theory)

will be substituted by a new set of relations. We may in the meantime try to surmise some

sort of eﬀects which could be the outcome of the quantum substructure. The aim of this

paper is to investigate the possibility that the coupling between matter and the gravitational

ﬁeld varies in a random way, possibly due to quantum gravitational eﬀects.

The variability of fundamental constants is an old idea which goes back to Dirac [5],

and it would be a clear indication of new physics.

In fact, the variation of fundamental

constants would entail a violation of the Equivalence Principle [6, 7] and could not ﬁnd

an explanation within the same framework where those constants belong. In the language

of eﬀective ﬁeld theories, such constants would be replaced by new (scalar) ﬁelds obeying

their own dynamics [6], as for instance in the framework of Brans-Dicke theory [8] (or more

general scalar-tensor theories of gravity), where the gravitational constant is determined by

the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton. Clearly, in this framework the variation of

fundamental constants must be slow enough, both in space and time, so as to guarantee

the reproducibility of the experiments performed so far. The possibility of measuring such

variations, as well as the theoretical reasons for introducing such dimensionful quantities

in ﬁrst place, are actually delicate issues that have generated debate in the community.

Interested readers are referred to e.g. Refs. [9, 10]. We will see in the following that the

variability of the coupling, which can be expressed in a unit independent fashion in terms of

dimensionless quantities, is the physically relevant (and measurable) quantity. While most

of the theoretical work on variable constants has been on a more or less regular variability

on cosmological scales, the motivations of this work point to a stochastic variability on very

short scales, typically Planckian. Thus, it is in general conceivable that GN could not be a

constant at the outset but instead it must be determined from the microscopic dynamics,

hence in principle it can be aﬀected by the collective behaviour of spacetime quanta. Anal-
ogous considerations apply to  [11] for the eﬀects induced by its stochastic ﬂuctuations

2

on nonrelativistic quantum systems. In fact, it is a general property of quantum systems

that fast degrees of freedom can be approximated by stochastic noise, see Ref. [12]. In the

following, we assume that the eﬀects of the underlying microscopic dynamics of spacetime

can be given an eﬀective classical description by means of a stochastic gravitational con-

stant. The ﬂuctuations and the typical time scale of the stochastic process must be suitably
small, e.g. O(tPl), to ensure that there is no contradiction with observations. A ﬂuctuating
gravitational background can induce the Higgs mass term as well [13].

Newton’s gravitational constant appears in the fundamental equation of Einstein’s theory

of General Relativity

Gab = 8πGN Tab .

(1)

We take Eq. (1) as a starting point and work out the consequences of having a dynamical

GN. Turning GN naively into a dynamical variable, while keeping Tab covariantly conserved,

would result into a violation of the Bianchi identities, as pointed out already in Ref. [14].

0 = ∇aGab = 8π∇a(GNTab) .

(2)

The solution to the impasse is to split the energy-momentum tensor into a matter term,

which satisﬁes the usual conservation law, and a correction term such that Eq. (2) is satisﬁed:

Tab = T matter

ab

+ τab .

In a isotropic and homogeneous cosmological model, we have

T matter

ab

= (ρ + p)uaub + pgab ,

(3)

(4)

where ua is tangent to the geodesic of a isotropic observer and the ﬂuid satisﬁes the equation

of state p = wρ. A similar ansatz could be made for the extra term. However, since

it represents the only part of the energy-momentum tensor that does not arise from the

matter sector, it is quite natural to connect it to the only such form of energy there is

evidence for, namely to dark energy. We therefore write

τab = −λgab .

(5)

In this way dark energy is naturally connected to the dynamics of GN, stemming from

quantum gravitational eﬀects. There is no need for other physical ﬁelds to be introduced

in the theory.

In contrast to Ref. [14], we are not trying to establish a connection with

3

the matter sector in order to explain such variations. Rather, we argue that their origin

is entirely due to quantum geometry eﬀects. At the macroscopic level, these must be such

that general covariance and the Bianchi identities are preserved. An extra constraint on

the form of τab comes from observations, which tell us that it has to satisfy Eq. (5). In the

following we will consider just variation over time. This is to be considered a toy model of a

full treatment for which variations are, always at Planckian scales, in both space and time.

The physical ﬂuid satisﬁes the continuity equation

˙ρ + 3H(ρ + p) = 0 .

(6)

The evolution of the time-dependent “cosmological constant” λ is obtained from the Bianchi

identities

˙GN(ρ + λ) + GN

˙λ = 0 .

The solution to this equation is

λ(t) =

Considering ti in the matter- or radiation-dominated era, λ(ti) (cid:28) ρ(ti) and we can safely
neglect the second term in the r.h.s. of the above equation. Notice that in this case, Eq. (9)

does not make any reference to λ, but all dark energy contributions are instead included in

the time evolution of GN via an integral operator.

By diﬀerentiating Eq. (9) and using Eq. (6), in the case of a Universe ﬁlled with non-

relativistic matter (w = 0), we get

˙H = −4πGNρ ,

(10)

which together with Eq. (6) and the constraint on the initial conditions for ρ and H, namely

H 2(ti) =

8π

GN(ti)ρ(ti) ,

fully determines the dynamics. We can express

GN(t) = GN(1 + σξ(t))

4

(11)

(12)

as the sum of a constant background value and a perturbation. Note that the last equation

still makes sense even if one assumes the point of view of Ref. [9]. In fact, once we introduce

a units system, e.g. one such that GN = 1, Eq. (12) is equivalent to the statement that

the r.h.s. of Einstein’s equations (1) has a nonstandard form, with new terms that can be

expressed in terms of dimensionless quantities.

Let us rewrite Eq. (10) in a diﬀerential form, namely

dH = −4πGNρ(1 + σξ(t))dt .

Assuming that ξ(t) has a white noise distribution, the last equation reads

dH = −4πGNρ(dt + σdWt) ,

(13)

(14)

where Wt is a Wiener process. Loosely speaking the white noise is the derivative of the

Wiener process and satisﬁes the properties

(cid:104)ξ(t)(cid:105) = 0,

(15)

(cid:104)ξ(t)ξ(t(cid:48))(cid:105) = δ(t − t(cid:48)) ,

(16)
where (cid:104) (cid:105) denotes an ensemble average. A mathematically more precise description of a
stochastic process is given by considering a discrete time evolution and using the theory of
stochastic integration [15]. Thus, Eq. (14) is interepreted as a ˆIto process. For the sake of
simplicity we consider a partition of the interval ti ≡ t0 < t1 < . . . < tk < . . . < tN ≡ t with
uniform time step h.

The Wiener process Wt has the following properties:
• Wti = 0 with probability 1;
• The increments Wtk+1−Wtk are statistically independent Gaussian variables with mean

0 and variance tk+1 − tk = h.

It plays the rˆole of a stochastic driving term in Eq. (14).

We have investigated numerically the behaviour of the solutions for such a model with
parameters 0 ≤ σ ≤ 1, 10−6 ≤ h ≤ 10−2, in units such that GN = 1, for diﬀerent choices
of the initial condition ρ(ti). Qualitatively the behaviour of the solutions is the same and is

represented in Fig. 1 for a given path Wt, where the plot of the energy density ρ(t) and the

Hubble rate H(t) is shown.

σ = 0.1, ρ0 = 10 and time step h = 10−4, in units such that GN = 1. The horizontal asymptote
of H(t) for t → ∞ corresponds to a late era of accelerated expansion, when the Universe is

dominated by a “cosmological constant”. Stochastic noise has an eﬀect which is relevant at early

times, whereas it is negligible at late times since it is suppressed by the small value of the energy

density, as one can also see from (14). The qualitative behaviour of the solutions is a general

feature, which does not depend on the particular choice of parameters.

As t → ∞, ρ decays as in standard cosmology, while H attains a nonvanishing positive
limit. The value of the asymptotic limit does not vary much with the random sequence,

and is not particularly sensitive to the parameters. Since we are dealing with a simpliﬁed

model this semi qualitative analysis is suﬃcient. This implies an exponential expansion at

late times without the need to introduce a cosmological constant by hand or to originate it

from the matter sector, e.g. as vacuum energy. Note that this is a general feature of the

model that does not depend on the particular values chosen for ρ0 or the noise strength σ.

era, namely ρ ∝ 1/t2 and H ∝ 1/t.

The eﬀective cosmological constant in the r.h.s. of Eq. (9) is given by the formula

where the second term is a stochastic integral. The ﬁrst term dominates over the second

with probability close to 1, as shown in the following. Hence, when the ﬁrst step of the

random walk is positive, the Universe is exponentially expanding at late times, whereas for

a negative initial step H takes large negative values. We are therefore led to assume the

initial condition

ξ(ti) > 0 ,

(18)

which guarantees the stability of the Universe and is compatible with the observed acceler-

ated expansion.

We compute the probability to observe a negative value of the eﬀective cosmological

constant given the initial condition on the noise (18). This actually forces the ﬁrst step

of the random walk to follow a half-normal distribution, whereas all the other steps of the

random walk are normally distributed, as it is customary. Using the statistical properties of

the increments of the Wiener process Wt one ﬁnds

Therefore the value Λ = 0 is x standard deviations away from its mean value, with

Hence, the probability of observing a non-positive value of Λ (leading to a collapsing Uni-
verse) is (cid:46) 0.0095, regardless of the initial condition, the noise strength σ and the time
step. In a more complete treatment which may take also space variation into account, these

unstable cases will anyway not be a problem, since the instabilities will be just covered by

the expanding areas.

Considering a Universe with more than one matter component, the eﬀective cosmologi-

cal constant receives contribution from each of them, with the dominant contribution still

coming from the initial value of the white noise ξ(ti) multiplied by the total energy density

as in (17). In other words, the eﬀective cosmological constant depends on the initial value

of the total energy density, but not on the species populating the Universe. It seems natural
to ﬁx the initial data at a time where all species where equally dominating, i.e. ti ≈ tPl.
This conclusion, if correct, due to the limits of our eﬀective approach at Planckian times,

implies that the ﬁnal stage of evolution of the Universe is entirely determined by quantum

ﬂuctuations of the spacetime geometry at early times. Furthermore, being determined only

by the initial value of the total energy density, it treats all ﬁelds on the same level and it is

insensitive to further details of the Universe’s history. In this sense Eq. (18) can be inter-

preted as a constraint on the underlying quantum theory, at the time when the dynamics of

the fast degrees of freedom of the gravitational ﬁeld approach their stochastic limit.

OUTLOOK AND CONCLUSIONS

Within an eﬀective macroscopic description of the dynamics of the gravitational ﬁeld, we

have considered a stochastically ﬂuctuating gravitational constant as a possible phenomeno-

logical feature of a theory of quantum gravity. Consistency with the Bianchi identities

requires the addition of an extra source term, which does not communicate with the matter

sector and may be interpreted as dark energy. We built a simple model where the latter is

seen to be responsible for the present acceleration in the expansion of the Universe, which

is thus seen to have a purely quantum geometrical origin. The simpliﬁcations introduced in

the model and the sensitivity of the eﬀective cosmological constant to the value of the total

energy density at the Planck time prevent us from using such model to extract quantitative

predictions for the present value of the cosmological constant and its probability. It is our

hope that this preliminary work could open new ways towards a solution to the cosmological

constant problem.

If the picture obtained from our model could be consistently obtained from a fundamental

theory of quantum gravity, it would show that quantum gravitational phenomena are already

being observed in the Universe today when looking at the acceleration of its expansion rate.

Moreover, it would provide indirect evidence for the variation over time of the gravitational

8

constant. More work has to be done in order to gain a better understanding of the rˆole

played by the initial conditions on the energy content of the Universe, since the cosmological

constant obtained from our toy model seems to have a strong dependence on them.
