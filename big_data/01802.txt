Abstract.

The theoretical concept of Chakrabarti-Titarchuk two Component
Advective Flow (TCAF) model was introduced around two decade ago in
mid-90s. Recently after the inclusion of TCAF model into XSPEC as an
additive table model, we ﬁnd that it is quite capable to ﬁt spectra from
diﬀerent phases of few transient black hole candidates (TBHCs) during
their outbursts. This quite agrees with our theoretical understanding. Here,
a brief summary of our recent studies of spectral and temporal properties
of few TBHCs during their X-ray outbursts with TCAF will be discussed.

Introduction

Recently after the inclusion of TCAF model (Chakrabarti & Titarchuk, 1995, here-
after CT95) into HeaSARC’s spectral analysis software package XSPEC as an addit-
ive table model (Debnath et al., 2014, 2015a,b; Mondal et al. 2014; Jana et al., 2016;
hereafter DCM14, DMC15, DMCM15, DMC14, JDCMM15 respectively), one can
directly extract physical ﬂow parameters, such as two types of accretion (Keplerian
disk ˙md and sub-Keplerian halo ˙mh) rates and shock parameters (location Xs and com-
pression ratio R of shock) from spectral ﬁts. Evolution of these ﬂow parameters, ac-
cretion rate ratio (ARR; i.e., ˙mh/ ˙md), and nature of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs;
if present) provides us a better understanding on accretion ﬂow dynamics around BHs.

2. Results and Discussions

Until now, we successfully studied accretion ﬂow dynamics of four Galactic TBHCs
(H 1743-322, GX 339-4, MAXI J1659-152, MAXI J1836-194) using RXTE data
during their X-ray outbursts with TCAF. A strong correlation between spectral and
temporal properties of these TBHCs is observed. In ARR-intensity diagram (ARRID;
see, MDC14, JDCMM15) diﬀerent spectral states are found to be correlated with
diﬀerent branches of the diagram. Generally hard (HS), hard-intermediate (HIMS),
soft-intermediate (SIMS) and soft (SS) spectral states are observed during an outburst
of TBHCs in the sequence of HS → HIMS→ SIMS → SS → SIMS → HIMS →
HS. Our recent studies with TCAF conﬁrms that the boundaries and properties of
these diﬀerent spectral states can easily be explained with the variation of ARR and
nature of QPOs (if present). Also one can predict the frequency of the dominating
QPOs with TCAF model ﬁtted shock parameters (see, DCM14). We believe that
an outburst is triggered due to a sudden rise in viscosity (α ≥ 0.15, see for more
details, Nagarkoti & Chakrabarti, this Volume) and is turned oﬀ due to the reduction
in viscosity. If viscosity does not rise signiﬁcantly, Keplerian component does not
become dominating over sub-Keplerian component, and as a result of that we may
miss SS as well as SIMS during an outburst (see, DMCM15, JDCMM15), which
could be termed as ‘failed’ outburst. The nature of QPOs (generally type C) are found
to evolve monotonically during rising/declining phase of HS and HIMS (Chakrabarti
et al., 2008, 2015; Debnath et al., 2010, 2013; Nandi et al., 2012), with a local maxima
of ARR on the transition day of HS ⇋ HIMS and of evolving QPO frequency on
HIMS⇋SIMS transition day (see, MDC14, DMC15, DMCM15). QPOs (generally
type B or A) are observed sporadically on and oﬀ during SIMS and with absentia in
SS (Nandi et al., 2012; Debnath et al., 2008, 2013). Generally, ARR rapidly increases
during HS (rising), and decreases during HIMS (rising). The opposite scenario is
observed during declining phase of these two states. It also has been found that ARR
stays at lower values during SIMS (slow random variation) and SS (roughly constant).
