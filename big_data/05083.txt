Abstract

We study the angular deﬂection of the circular polarized components of a linearly polarized probe ﬁeld in a weakly birefringent
atomic system in tripod conﬁguration. A spatially inhomogeneous control ﬁeld incident obliquely onto an atomic vapor cell
facilitates a large angular divergence between circular components. We show that the angular resolution can be dynamically
controlled by optimally choosing the angle of incidence and the transverse proﬁle of the control beam. For instance, by employing
a Laguerre-Gaussian proﬁle of the control ﬁeld, one can impart a large angular divergence to the circular components close to
the entry face of the atomic vapor cell. We further demonstrate how such a medium causes the focusing and refocusing of the
probe ﬁeld, thereby acting as a convex or a concave lens with multiple foci. The absorption in the medium remains negligible
at resonance as a cumulative eﬀect of coherent population oscillations (CPO) and electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT).

INTRODUCTION

Many optical phenomena like refraction and disper-
sion, characterized by the refractive index of the medium,
cause a change in the trajectory of the incident light.
This change is a consequence of the spatial variation of
the refractive index. The control of refractive index in-
side the medium is important for optical switching, op-
tical lithography, optical imaging, and optical commu-
nication technologies. In the past decades, optical beam
deﬂection has achieved a considerable attention. The de-
ﬂection of light beam can be achieved by mechanical in-
teraction [1], thermal gradient [2], acousto-optical inter-
action [3], electro-optic eﬀect [4] and all-optical methods
[5]. Optical methods have enjoyed much attention due to
their high speed, eﬃciency and fast nonlinear response
time.

Manoeuvering light by another light through their in-
teraction with the medium has created a new avenue of
research. Much interest has been given to the deﬂec-
tion of light beam in a homogeneous medium subjected
to external ﬁelds with spatially inhomogeneous intensity
distributions. The spatial modulation of the refractive
index of the medium induced by a suitable inhomoge-
neous control ﬁeld leads to several eﬀects such as dy-
namic light deﬂection [6, 7], waveguiding [8], and anti-
waveguiding [9]. A signiﬁcant variation of the refractive
index at resonance can give rise to lage deﬂection. Re-
cently, such a deﬂection in an atomic medium, exhibit-
ing electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), is
observed in presence of a magnetic ﬁeld with small gra-
dient transverse to the propagation direction [10–12]. In
another related experiment [13], it is found that the light
ray can also be deﬂected when an optical ﬁeld with inho-
mogeneous transverse proﬁle drives a cell with Rb atomic
vapors with Λ-type energy-level conﬁguration. The angle
of deviation obtained by means of optical ﬁeld is found to
be much larger (by several order) than that reported us-

∗ pradeep.kumar@iitrpr.ac.in

ing inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld [12]. An adequate ex-
planation for the observed phenomenon of light deﬂection
can be provided in the framework of semiclassical theory
[14, 15]. Further, the beam deﬂection in EIT medium
can also be explained quantum mechanically with dark
state polariton possessing an eﬀective magnetic moment
[12, 16, 17]. Besides this, the deﬂection of light in terms
of vector optical solitons in a double EIT system (non-
linear polariton) is proposed in [18]. In addition to the
EIT medium, a large optically induced deﬂection [19] and
antiwaveguiding [20] are reported in active Raman gain
(ARG) medium. It is also shown that the ARG medium
leads to larger deﬂection of light beams, than an EIT
medium [19].

In order to measure the small deﬂections of beams,
many sophisticated interferometric setups have been pro-
posed [21, 22]. Some of these techniques are inspired by
quantum weak measurement [23] to resolve Angstrom-
scale optical beam deﬂection in space as well as in time
domain [24, 25]. In this paper, instead of making sen-
sitive detection of small deﬂection, we rather propose a
way to increase the angular separation between the cir-
cular components of the probe ﬁeld by using an inhomo-
geneous control ﬁeld in an atomic vapor system with tri-
pod conﬁguration. We present a theoretical analysis (in
the framework of semiclassical theory) to demonstrate
such a polarization-dependent light deﬂection where the
control beam is incident obliquely to the entrance face of
the vapor cell. This oblique incidence of the control beam
causes the mixing of the excitations on all the three op-
tical transitions in the tripod system, leading to an extra
ﬂexibility to produce large angular divergence among σ±
components of the probe ﬁeld by changing the angle of
incidence. It should be borne in mind that a medium of
chiral molecules also creates the birefringence and hence
the angular divergence between the circular components
of the linearly polarized light. In [26], it has been demon-
strated that such an eﬀect can occur at the interface of
achiral and chiral media and can be used for the detec-
tion of optical activity [27] with a miniaturized sample
volume. Here, we mimic such a situation in atomic va-
pors by exploring maximum angular divergence close to

1

the entry face of the vapor cell.

Note that an inhomogeneous control ﬁeld can create a
birefringence inside a medium [28]. By suitably choos-
ing the transverse proﬁle of the control ﬁeld, one can
enhance this birefringence to impart larger angular di-
vergence of the orthogonal components. We show that
by choosing a Laguerre-Gaussian proﬁle [29] of the con-
trol ﬁeld, angular divergence can be made larger, com-
pared to that as obtained using a Gaussian proﬁle. This
also results in the focusing and refocusing eﬀects of σ±
components of the probe ﬁeld at various axial positions.
We detect a few focal points for the probe ﬁeld depend-
ing on the proﬁle and the incidence angle of the control
beam. Thereby, a medium with suitable length behaves
as a convex or a concave lens [16]. It is to be empha-
sized that the large angular divergence of the circular
components of the probe ﬁeld is accompanied by zero
absorption at resonance, thanks to the collective eﬀects
of CPO and EIT [30]. Thus, this paper essentially fo-
cuses on the enhancement of the angular separation of
circularly polarized components of the probe ﬁeld by us-
ing the incident angle and the transverse proﬁle of the
control ﬁeld .

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II,
the theoretical model is introduced along with the eikonal
approximation for the probe deﬂection. The inﬂuence of
the angle of incidence and the proﬁle of control ﬁeld on
the deﬂection of circular components of the probe ﬁeld is
described in Sec. III. In this Section, the main results of
the paper are presented. Sec. IV summarizes this paper.

II. PHYSICAL MODEL

We consider a generic four-level tripod atomic sys-
tem as shown in Fig. 1(a). The relevant energy lev-
els are found in many systems such as in 39K [31], 23Na
[32], 7Li [33], Pr:YSO [34]. Here, we used the transi-
tion 2S1/2 → 2P1/2 at 769.9 nm of 39K vapors. The
ground levels are |1i = 2S1/2 (F = 2, mF = −1), |0i =
2S1/2 (F = 2, mF = 0),|2i = 2S1/2 (F = 2, mF = +1)
and the upper state is |3i = 2P1/2 (F = 1, mF = 0). The
upper level |3i (mF = 0) is coupled to the ground lev-
els |1i (mF = +1) and |2i (mF = −1) by a ˆx-polarized
weak probe ﬁeld ~Ep = ˆxεpe−i(ωpt−kpz) + c.c. propagating
along z-direction. Here, εp is the slowly varying enve-
lope, ωp is the angular frequency and kp is the propaga-
tion constant of the probe ﬁeld. The orthogonal compo-
nents of the probe with σ+ and σ− polarizations couple
to |1i ↔ |3i and |2i ↔ |3i transitions, respectively. The
Rabi frequencies of the corresponding transitions are de-
ﬁned as 2g1 =2(cid:16) ~d31·ˆxεp
(cid:17), where ~dij
represents the transition electric dipole moment matrix
element between the levels |ii and |ji. The degeneracy
of the ground level has been removed by applying a dc
magnetic ﬁeld of strength B along the quantization z-
axis. The Zeeman splitting among the respective lev-

applying a feeble axial magnetic ﬁeld. γj3 (j = 0, 1, 2) are the

is incident obliquely at an angle θc to the medium with
polarization lying in the plane of incidence, as shown in
Fig. 1 (b). Here εc, kc and ωc are the slowly varying enve-
lope, propagation constant and the frequency of the con-
trol ﬁeld. This ﬁeld couples to |ji ↔ |3i (j = 0, 1, 2) tran-
sitions. The corresponding Rabi frequencies of the con-
trol ﬁeld are given by 2Gi=2[εc (cos θc ˆx + sin θc ˆz)]· ~dji/
(i =0,1,2 and j =3). Using the circular polarization vec-
tor ˆǫ = (ˆx ± iˆy) /√2, these Rabi frequencies can be sim-

the Appendix.

A. Susceptibility of the atomic medium

In the steady state, we can obtain the approximate
solution for the linear susceptibility of the medium for
the probe ﬁeld. Here, we are interested in the atomic co-
herences ˜ρ(+1)
for the orthogonal components
of the probe ﬁeld which can be obtained by solving Eq.
(A.3). Thus, the susceptibility of the atomic medium for
the orthogonal components of the probe ﬁeld is given by

B. Probe deﬂection

In general, the spatial structure of the applied ﬁelds
results in the position dependence of the medium sus-
ceptibility [Eq. (3)]. The trajectory of a light ray propa-
gating through an inhomogeneous medium can be found
by solving an eikonal equation [35]

(∇ψ) · (∇ψ) = n2 ,

(4)

where, the eikonal ψ represents the phase of the electro-
magnetic wave and n = 1 + 2πRe [χ] describes the refrac-
tive index of the medium. Now, by deﬁning ∇ψ = n d ~R

we obtain following diﬀerential equation:

In paraxial limit, ds ≈ dz for small deﬂections and the

(7)

Using Eq. (7) the trajectory of the ray and the deﬂec-
tion angle can be estimated. Let us assume that the
atomic vapor cell can be divided into many smaller cells
such that the external inhomogeneous ﬁeld appears to
be homogeneous for each smaller cell. Thus, the angle of
deﬂection for the probe ﬁeld [13] can be obtained from
Eq. (7) by solving

where, tan θx (tan θy) represents the slope and θx (θy) is
the angle of deﬂection of the light rays in the xz-plane
(yz-plane). For smaller angle of deﬂection, tan θx ≈
θx (tan θy ≈ θy) and Eq. (8) yields

where, L is the length of the medium in the direction of

verse proﬁle of the control ﬁeld is conﬁned to the y = 0
plane. Due to the anisotropy induced by the inhomo-
geneity of the control ﬁeld [28], the refractive index n±
and the corresponding angle of deﬂection θ± of the σ±
components will be diﬀerent, giving rise to an angular
divergence φ = θ+ − θ−.

III. RESULTS

A. Beam proﬁle of the control ﬁeld

index for the probe ﬁeld, we choose the following trans-
verse proﬁle of the control ﬁeld

of the beam, θ = tan−1(cid:0) y
As the control ﬁeld is incident at an angle θc to the
vapor cell, we can write X = x cos θc − z sin θc and

X(cid:1) and Rz = Z(cid:16)1 +(cid:0) zR

0/λ is the Rayleigh length.

Z = x sin θc+z cos θc as the coordinates in the plane of in-
cidence. For m = 0, the above proﬁle becomes Gaussian,
whereas, it corresponds to a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG)m
proﬁle with azimuthal index m for m 6= 0. The spatial
structure of the control ﬁeld produces inhomogeneity for
the susceptibility of the probe ﬁeld along the transverse
direction.

B. Dependence of angular divergence on angle of

incidence

To delineate the eﬀect of angle of incidence on the an-
gular divergence between σ± components of the probe
ﬁeld, we ﬁrst consider a Gaussian proﬁle (LG0) of the
control ﬁeld. At two-photon resonance, the Gaussian
proﬁle of the control ﬁeld creates transparency for the
probe ﬁeld at x=0 whereas the position-dependent re-
fractive index remain zero. The circular components of
the probe ﬁeld experience deﬂection if the probe is oﬀ-
centered with respect to the control ﬁeld. We demon-
strate in Fig.
2 the variation of the angular diver-
gence between the orthogonal polarized components of
the probe ﬁeld with the longitudinal distance for diﬀer-
ent values of the angle of incidence at y =0 plane. The
angular divergence has a dispersion like proﬁle with max-
ima and minima at diﬀerent axial positions, as shown in
Fig. 2. Note that the deﬂection of σ± components occurs
within a short distance from the interface. Also a zero
angular divergence refers to a focal point, where both
the σ± components converge along the propagation di-
rection. Several such points appear, as seen in Fig. 2.
The maxima and minima of the angular divergence oc-
cur at a larger distance for smaller angle of incidence.
For smaller angle of incidence, the inhomogeneous con-
trol ﬁeld moves close to the axis of the probe ﬁeld in the
vapor cell and a larger overlap area of these ﬁelds causes
the angular divergence to happen at longer propagation
distance [see Fig. 2(a)]. Thereby, the angle of incidence
of the control ﬁeld provides a ﬂexibility to control to the
angular divergence of the polarized components.

It is to be noted that a reasonable explanation for such
a light deﬂection can be given in terms of the spatial de-
pendent potential induced by the coupling between the
atoms and the light [17]. The transverse proﬁle of the
control ﬁeld decides the shape of such a potential. Thus,
a probe ﬁeld of width smaller than the width of the con-
trol ﬁeld gets deﬂected if it is adjusted to the left or to
the right side of control ﬁeld.

C. Eﬀect of the proﬁle of the control ﬁeld

Next we discuss the eﬀect of the proﬁle of the con-
trol beam on the angular divergence between σ± compo-
nents of the probe ﬁeld. For this purpose, we consider
a doughnut-shaped Laguerre-Gaussian mode (LG3) for
the control beam. The central dark region of the con-

verse width of Gaussian proﬁle is taken to be √2 mm. Also
we choose the electric ﬁeld amplitude ε0 in such a way that

trol ﬁeld causes the absorption of the probe ﬁeld along
with zero spatial refractive index, whereas the gain ap-
pears in the bright region with large position-dependent
refractive index.
In this way the probe beam can be

5

guided appropriately inside the medium. This mimics
the waveguide [8, 36, 37] and antiwavguide [9] like fea-
tures in the atomic vapor cell. Thus, the probe beam can
acquire the shape of the control beam during the course
of its propagation through the medium [20]. In Fig. 3, we
exhibit the dependence of the angular divergence on the
propagation distance for diﬀerent values of the incident
angles of the control ﬁeld. Clearly, a comparison of Figs.
2 and 3 reveals that the doughnut-shaped LG3 mode is
better than the Gaussian mode to produce larger angular
divergence. Also, for the same angle of incidence, LG3
proﬁle of the control ﬁeld produces more number of focal
points than a Gaussian proﬁle. More interestingly, for
the Laguerre-Gaussian mode, the large deﬂection occurs
within a very short distance from the entrance face of
the vapor cell. This feature mimics the refraction of a
linearly polarized light from the interface, as in the case
of a medium with chiral molecules [26]. For a medium
having natural anisotropy due to the presence of chiral
molecules, a linearly polarized incident light splits into
circularly polarized components just at the interface. It
is to be noted that here we obtain an angular divergence
which is an order of magnitude larger than that reported
in [13, 15]. Further the angular divergence, demonstrated
in Fig. 3, is comparable to that reported in ARG medium
[19], which are known to have larger deﬂection than an
EIT medium.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have explored the enhancement of
the angular divergence between the orthogonally polar-
ized components of the linearly polarized probe ﬁeld by
using angle of incidence and the proﬁle of the control
beam as a knob. Such an eﬀect can be enhanced by us-
ing higher order Laguerre-Gaussian modes in the proﬁle
of the control ﬁeld. For LG3 mode, the maximum de-
ﬂection happens close to the entry face of the vapor cell.
We further show that the atomic medium can act as a
convex or a concave lens with multiple foci, depending
upon the proﬁle and the angle of incidence of the control
beam.

It is to be emphasized that the dynamic deﬂection of
the circular components of the probe ﬁeld is followed by
zero absorption for all angles of incidence of the control
ﬁeld. The transparency of the probe ﬁeld can be at-
tributed to two distinct eﬀects viz. coherent population
oscillations (CPO) [38, 39] and EIT. When the angle of
incidence is small, then the right and left circularly po-
larized components of the control ﬁeld become stronger
than the π-component. Thus, the tripod system behaves
eﬀectively like a Λ-system in which probe and control
ﬁelds drive the same transitions, leading to transparency
due to CPO [40]. On the other hand, if the angle of inci-
dence is increased, the π-component of the control ﬁeld
becomes crucial to make the medium transparent, thanks
to EIT [30]. Thus, the cumulative eﬀect of CPO and EIT

assists in providing transparency in the medium.

ﬁeld (probe ﬁeld) from the transition |0i ↔ |3i transition
and ωpc = δ−∆ is the frequency diﬀerence between probe
and control ﬁeld. Here, γij is the spontaneous emission
rate from the level |ji to |ii, Γij = 1
2Pk
(γki + γkj ) +
γcoll is the dephasing rate of the coherence between the
levels |ji and |ii, and γcoll is the collisional decay rate.
The transformations for the density matrix elements are
as follows: ρ3j = ˜ρ3je−iωct (j = 0, 1, 2) and the rest of
the elements remain the same. In the weak probe ﬁeld
limit, the density matrix elements can be expanded to
ﬁrst order in g’s in terms of the harmonics ωpc as

˜ραβ = ˜ρ(0)

αβ + g1e−iωpct ˜ρ′(+1)

αβ + g∗1eiωpct ˜ρ′′(+1)

αβ

+ g2e−iωpct ˜ρ′(−1)

αβ + g∗2eiωpct ˜ρ′′(−1)

αβ

.

(A.2)

where ˜ρ(0)
αβ represents the zeorth order solution in the ab-
sence of the probe ﬁeld and ˜ρ(n)
αβ describes the nth-order
solution. By substituting Eq. (A.2) in Eq. (A.1) and
equating the like terms, we obtain the following algebraic
equations for the zeroth and ﬁrst order coherences:
