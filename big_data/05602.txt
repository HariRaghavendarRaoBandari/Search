Abstract

We propose to search for purely baryonic decay processes at the LHCb experiment. No such

process has ever been observed. In particular, we concentrate on the decay Λ0

b → p¯pn, which is
the simplest purely baryonic decay mode, with solely spin-1/2 baryons involved. We predict its
decay branching ratio to be B(Λ0
−0.2) × 10−6, which is suﬃciently large to make
the decay mode accessible to LHCb. Though not considered in general, purely baryonic decays

b → p¯pn) = (2.0+0.3

could shed light on the puzzle of the baryon number asymmetry in the universe by means of a

better understanding of the baryonic nature of our matter world. As such, they constitute a yet

unexplored class of decay processes worth investigating. Our study can be extended to other purely
b → Λ¯ΛΛ, as well as to similar anti-triplet

b → Λ¯pΛ and Λ0

baryonic decays such as Λ0

b-baryon decays such as Ξ0,−

INTRODUCTION

It is well known that every (anti-)baryon except the (anti-)proton decays to a lighter
(anti-)baryon, such as the beta decay of the neutron, n → pe− ¯νe, which is the simplest
baryonic decay. However, up to now, no purely baryonic decay process, with only baryons

involved, has yet been observed [1]. By virtue of the baryon number conservation, in order

to have a purely baryonic decay, at least three baryons in the ﬁnal state are needed, e.g.
¯Bl2Bl3, where h and li represent heavy and light spin-1/2 baryons, respectively.
Bh → Bl1
It is easy to show that the simplest, and lightest, possible purely baryonic decay process is
Λ0
b → p¯pn without breaking any known conservation law. Other examples of such decays
are Λ0
decays.

b → Λ¯ΛΛ as well as the corresponding Ξ0,−

b → p¯pΛ, Λ0

b → Λ¯pΛ, and Λ0

Since baryons are the main constituents of our matter world, their production and decay

mechanisms should all be explored.

Being one of the three conditions for the baryogenesis to explain the puzzle of the matter

and anti-matter asymmetry in the universe, CP violation has been a primary topic of study

at the B-factories and at the LHCb experiment. However, the unique physical CP phase in

the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix [2] of the Standard Model

(SM) is not suﬃcient to solve the mystery, leaving room for new physics in the formation of

the matter world. On the other hand, for a direct connection to the baryonic contents of the

universe, one expects to observe CP violation in purely baryonic processes. Theoretically and

experimentally, though, the latter has never been studied before. Clearly, it is interesting to

discuss CP violating rate asymmetries as well as time-reversal violating spin involved triple

correlations due to the rich spin structures in these purely baryonic decays to test the SM

and search for new physics manifestations.

In the SM, the decay Λ0

b → p¯pn, with the tree-level dominated contribution through the
V−A quark currents, can be factorized as a color-allowed process, which is insensitive to
non-factorizable eﬀects, where the required matrix elements of the Λ0
b → p transition and the
recoiled ¯pn pair have been well studied. A reliable prediction of the branching ratio is hence
expected, which should be as large as those in the tree-level B decays such as ¯B0 → π+π−.
In addition, the threshold eﬀect around the ¯pn invariant mass spectrum, measured as a

salient feature in three-body baryonic B decays, could also enhance the contribution.

It is interesting to note that in this simplest purely baryonic decay Λ0

b → p¯pn, a possible

from ﬁnal-state interactions is negligible.

In this letter, we concentrate on this simplest purely baryonic decay Λ0

b → p¯pn. We
will give the theoretical estimation of its decay branching ratio, and stimulate a possible

measurement by the LHCb collaboration. Possible CP- and T-violating eﬀects in purely

baryonic decays are also discussed.

factorizable eﬀects in the generalized version of the factorization approach. The amplitude

in Eq. (1) is dominated by the tree contribution from Fig. 1a, while that from Fig. 1c is

primarily the non-factorizable eﬀect with its size proportional to a2 within the uncertainty of

a1, which is expected to be small. On the other hand, the penguin contributions in Figs. 1b

In Eq. (1), the matrix elements for the baryon pair production are well deﬁned, given by

where q = pn + p¯p is the momentum transfer, F1,2, gA and hA are the timelike baryonic

form factors, and un(v¯p) is the neutron (anti-proton) spinor. On the other hand, the matrix
elements of the Λb → p baryon transition in Eq. (1) have the general forms:

the heavy-quark and large-energy symmetries in Ref. [5].

with γ = 2.148, Λ0 = 0.3 GeV and t ≡ q2 in pQCD counting rules [6–8], while f1(g1) is
presented as the double-pole momentum dependences: f1(g1) = Cf1(g1)/(1 − t/m2

Since the form factors are associated with the studies of baryonic B decays and b-baryon
decays, we use the numerical results in Refs. [4, 5, 8–11] to give (CF1, CgA, ChA) = (196.1 ±
37.6, 101.0 ± 37.6,−4.5 ± 2.2) GeV4, and Cf1 = Cg1 = 0.136 ± 0.009.

FIG. 2. The dibaryon invariant mass spectra for Λ0

b → p¯pn.

With all theoretical inputs, we ﬁnd

B(Λ0

b → p¯pn) = (2.0+0.3

−0.2 ± 0.1 ± 0.1) × 10−6 ,

(5)

where the errors come from the form factors, the non-factorizable eﬀects, and the CKM

matrix elements, respectively. By combining the uncertainties, we obtain the ﬁrst prediction,
−0.2)× 10−6, on the branching ratio of this purely baryonic decay, which
B(Λ0
is sizable and comparable to the branching ratios of other baryonic B decays observed at

b → p¯pn) = (2.0+0.3

the B-factories and LHCb.

Figure 2 displays the invariant mass spectra of mp¯n and mp¯p. The neutron-antiproton
invariant mass spectrum in Λ0
b → p¯pn presents the threshold eﬀect due to the form of 1/tn
for the p¯n-pair production, which is similar to the peak around the threshold area of mB ¯B′ ≃
mB+m ¯B′ that enhances the branching ratios in the three-body baryonic B → B ¯B′M decays.
On the other hand, the mp¯p distribution is in accordance with the fact that the proton and

antiproton are not pair-produced. Note that the spectra in Fig. 2 are partly a consequence

of ignoring the contributions from the diagrams in Figs. 1c and d. Future measurements

of dibaryon spectra should be able to test our assumptions, in particular the factorization

approach.

Since purely baryonic decays are directly connected to the baryonic contents of the uni-

verse, it is worthwhile to have systematic investigations for their decay branching ratios

and direct CP violating rate asymmetries as well as the possible T-odd triple correlations.

.

If both weak (γ) and strong (δ) phases are non-vanishing, one has that

ACP ∝ sin γ sin δ .

(6)

(7)

For T violation in purely baryonic decays, we can examine the triple product correlations of
the T-odd form ~v1 · (~v2 × ~v3) where ~vi are spins or momenta of the baryons. Explicitly, for
¯Bl2Bl3, there are many T-odd correlations of ~sBj · (~pBk × ~pBl)
this class of decays Bh → Bl1
and ~pBj · (~sBk × ~sBl), corresponding to one and two-spin respectively, due to the rich spin
structures of the baryons. The asymmetry depending on these correlations is deﬁned by

AT ≡

Γ(~v1 · (~v2 × ~v3) > 0) − Γ(~v1 · (~v2 × ~v3) < 0)
Γ(~v1 · (~v2 × ~v3) > 0) + Γ(~v1 · (~v2 × ~v3) < 0)

,

which results in

AT ∝ sin(γ + δ).

(8)

(9)

Note that AT may not indicate the real CP violating eﬀect in the gauge theory. In order to

obtain the true eﬀect, one can construct the asymmetry by using

where ¯AT is measured in the CP-conjugate decay process, and consequently one ﬁnds that

AT ≡

1
2

(AT − ¯AT ) ,

(10)

AT ∝ sin γ cos δ,

(11)

which is in general non-zero as long as γ 6= 0, no matter the strong phase δ exists or not.
In the SM, the direct CP violating asymmetry in Eq. (6) and T violating asymmetry in

Eq. (10) are estimated to be both around -4%. As some new CP violating mechanism is

anticipated, these asymmetries could be sensitive to it. For example, the asymmetries can

be enhanced in the CP violating models with charged Higgs and gauge bosons.

III. EXPERIMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

Experimentally speaking, the presence of a neutron in the ﬁnal state gives rise to a signa-

ture resembling that of a semi-leptonic decay. The LHCb experiment has already published

6

studies of such topologies with two charged tracks and a particle escaping detection, for
b → pµ¯νµ [12]. The analysis can be seen as a proof of concept for the study of

example Λ0
Λ0
b → p¯pn.
The observation of the Λ0

b → p¯pn signal is nevertheless rather challenging given a branch-
ing ratio signiﬁcantly lower than that of a typical semi-leptonic decay. Decays with a p¯p pair

in the ﬁnal state and extra invisible or non-reconstructed particles are potentially dangerous

sources of background, with branching ratios in the same range – 10−6 – as the signal.

The Λ0

b candidate can be reconstructed using the so-called corrected mass [13] deﬁned by

mcorr = qm2

p¯p + p2

⊥ + p⊥ ,

where mp¯p is the invariant mass of the p¯p pair and p⊥ its momentum transverse to the

Λ0

b direction of ﬂight. Figure 3 shows the distributions of the corrected p¯p mass for the

signal and a few typical background decay modes resulting from a toy simulation study.

Care has been taken to smear the momentum resolution of tracks according to the average

resolution published by the LHCb experiment. Also the relative contributions have been

scaled taking into account the experimental branching ratios (reasonable assumptions on

the branching ratio were made when the decay mode has not yet been observed) and typical

mis-identiﬁcation rates in LHCb [14].

The bottom ﬁgure gives in particular the sum over all contributions. The signal appears as
a shoulder around the region 5300 − 5500 MeV/c2. It is evident that isolation requirements
in Ref. [12] need to be exploited in order to control
similar to those implemented e.g.

the decays to p¯pX ﬁnal states, where X represents one or several charged and/or neutral

particles. An interesting alternative is the identiﬁcation of the signal neutron with the

calorimeter of the LHCb experiment. The authors are aware that no publication from

LHCb has ever studied neutrons, which makes the route challenging. These preliminary

studies do indicate, though, that the observation of Λ0

b → p¯pn at LHCb is promising.

For CP and/or T violation, although the current sensitivity of LHCb is unable to reach

the level predicted in the SM, it is still worthy to explore the CP/T violating asymmetries

as they could be large in the new CP violating models.
