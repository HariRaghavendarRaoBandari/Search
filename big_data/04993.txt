Abstract
We present a comprehensive review of physics eﬀects generated by leptoquarks
(LQs), i.e., hypothetical particles that can turn quarks into leptons and vice
versa, of either scalar or vector nature. These considerations include discussion
of possible completions of the Standard Model that contain LQ ﬁelds. The main
focus of the review is on those LQ scenarios that are not problematic with re-
gard to proton stability. We accordingly concentrate on the phenomenology of
light leptoquarks that is relevant for precision experiments and particle colliders.
Important constraints on LQ interactions with matter are derived from preci-
sion low energy observables such as electric dipole moments, (g − 2) of charged
leptons, atomic parity violation, neutral meson mixing, Kaon, B, and D me-
son decays, etc. We provide a general analysis of indirect constraints on LQ
Yukawa interactions to make statements that are as model independent as pos-
sible. We address complementary constraints that originate from electroweak
precision measurements, top, and Higgs physics. The Higgs physics analysis we
present covers not only the most recent but also expected results from LHC. We
ﬁnally discuss direct LQ searches. Current experimental situation is summa-
rized and self-consistency of assumptions that go into existing accelerator-based
searches is discussed. A progress in making next-to-leading order predictions
for both pair and single LQ productions at colliders is outlined. We dovetail
direct search ﬁndings with indirect constraints on available LQ parameter space
to obtain comprehensive summary of all results.

Leptoquarks (LQs), also referred to as lepto-quarks, are hypothetical parti-
cles that emerge in a particularly natural fashion in extensions of the Standard
Model (SM) that unify matter [1]. They have one special property that sets
them apart from all other elementary particles. Namely, LQs can turn quarks
into leptons and vice versa [2]. They thus represent unique source of new physics
that can be and has been extensively tested. LQ discovery would be a tentative
signal of matter uniﬁcation. This, on the other hand, would nicely dovetail with
the observed uniﬁcation of weak and electromagnetic interactions.

Even though a notion of LQs has been on the market for more than forty
years there is only a handful of reviews that cover diverse aspects of LQ phe-
nomenology [3, 4, 5]. There are admittedly several comprehensive studies of
speciﬁc facets of the LQ properties [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] that reﬂect the rich-
ness of the subject. However, there is not a single contemporary review that
covers the physics of light LQs.
In our view, this is the region of parameter
space where most of the recent experimental and theoretical progress has been
made. It is thus our opinion that the time is right to remedy this situation.

3

We accordingly provide a comprehensive yet succinct review of past and recent
advances in this ﬁeld of research.

The outline of the review is as follows. We list possible scalar and vector
LQ states and present associated nomenclature one can ﬁnd in the literature
in this section. We also address the issue of baryon (B) number and lepton
(L) number violation with the aim to single out those LQ scenarios that are
problematic with regard to matter stability. That is followed by discussion of
possible completions of the SM that contain ﬁelds of the LQ nature in Section 2.
From that point on we concentrate on the physics of light LQs.

A large number of important constraints on LQ interactions with matter
is extracted from precision low energy observables and presented in Section 3.
There are, moreover, many processes where the physics of LQs might provide ob-
servable correlated eﬀects. Recent notable examples include: (i) B → K∗ µ+ µ−
decays, where the LHCb collaboration reported deviations in their measure-
ments of angular observables from the corresponding SM theoretical estimates;
(ii) lepton ﬂavor universality ratios of B → K µ+ µ− and B → K e+ e− decays,
most precise LHCb measurements which currently also deviate from precise SM
predictions; (iii) lepton ﬂavor universality ratios of semitauonic b to c decays, as
reported by Belle, Babar and LHCb exhibit persisting deviations from the SM
expectations. In a number of theoretical explanations TeV scale LQs were con-
sidered as likely candidates to account for these anomalies. We address these
issues within the context of a general analysis of indirect constraints on LQ
Yukawa interactions trying to make statements that are as model independent
as possible.

We proceed by addressing complementary constraints that originate from top
quark phenomenology, electroweak precision measurements and Higgs physics
in Section 4. The latter is done in view of not only the most recent but also
expected results from LHC.

Finally, we discuss direct searches for LQs at colliders in Section 5. There
is a relatively large number of new constraints that is present in the literature
including some recent signal hints by the CMS collaboration. However, the
collider results do not originate only from LHC but also from LEP, Tevatron,
and HERA. We summarize the current experimental situation and discuss self-
consistency of assumptions that go into existing accelerator-based searches. For
example, one of them is a common ansatz (with few notable exceptions) that
LQs decay into particular generation of quarks and leptons without any ﬂavor
mixings. We also present in Section 5 leading order and progress in making
next-to-leading order predictions for both pair and single LQ production. We
ﬁnally correlate material in this section with the analysis of existing indirect
constraints on available LQ parameter space that precedes it.

Closing remarks are put forth in Section 6.

1.1. Nomenclature

LQs are ﬁelds that simultaneously couple to a quark and a lepton. In local
quantum ﬁeld theories they can be of either scalar (spin-zero) or vector (spin-
one) nature. Since the number of representations of quark and lepton ﬁelds

the numbers within brackets represent the SM gauge group SU (3) × SU (2) ×
U (1) transformation properties. For example, a state denoted as (3, 2, 1/6)
transforms as triplet (doublet) of SU (3) (SU (2)) with the U (1) hypercharge of
1/6. Superscript i(= 1, 2, 3) is a ﬂavor index and subscripts L and R denote
left- and right-chiral fermion ﬁelds, respectively. Superscript T will always stand
for transposition. It is in the SU (2) group space of the SM in this particular
instance. We take quarks (leptons) to have baryon (lepton) number B = 1/3
(L = 1) in accordance with the usual convention.

The (hyper)charge normalization is deﬁned through ˆQ = I3 + Y , where ˆQ is
the electric charge operator that yields eigenvalues Q in units of absolute value
of the electron charge, I3 stands for the diagonal generator of SU (2), and Y
represents U (1) hypercharge operator. The electric charge of dR ≡ (3, 1,−1/3)
is, for example, Q = 0 + (−1/3) = −1/3, where dR is right-chiral down-type
quark.
At least two neutrinos are conclusively massive. However, their Dirac and/or
Majorana nature is not yet experimentally ascertained. One might accordingly
add to the SM fermion content one or more electrically neutral ﬁelds that could
take on a role of right-chiral neutrinos. We denote these hypothetical fermions
with νR(≡ (1, 1, 0)). If these states are added one could have more LQ states
than there would be in the SM model with purely left-chiral neutrinos. We
include this possibility to insure generality of our considerations.

The list of all possible LQs is given in Table 1. There are, all in all, six scalar
and six vector LQ multiplets if one uses transformations under the SM gauge
group as the classiﬁcation criterion. In the ﬁrst column we explicitly specify the
SM transformation properties that can be easily understood on purely group
theoretical grounds as follows.

All quarks (leptons) are triplets (singlets) with regard to SU (3). This means
that all LQs should transform as 3-dimensional representations of SU (3) in
order for quark-lepton-LQ contraction(s) to be invariant under the SU (3) group
transformations. In group theoretical terms one uses a singlet (1) of SU (3) in
decomposition of the direct product 3 ⊗ 1 ⊗ 3 ≡ 8 ⊕ 1 that corresponds to
quark-lepton-LQ contraction(s). The dimensionality of SU (3) representation is
thus the same for all LQs. They are all triplets of SU (3).

The LQ dimensionality assignment under SU (2) is less trivial if compared
with the SU (3) case since both quarks and leptons are either singlets (1) or
doublets (2) of SU (2). Quark-lepton contractions can then be of triplet, doublet,
and singlet nature in SU (2) space since 2⊗ 2 ≡ 3⊕ 1, 2⊗ 1 ≡ 2, and 1⊗ 1 ≡ 1.
These representations, on the other hand, need to be contracted with LQs that
have the same SU (2) dimensionality in order to create gauge invariant terms.
LQs can thus be triplets, doublets, and singlets of SU (2). The dimensionality
under SU (2) can accordingly be used to distinguish between diﬀerent LQs. It
corresponds to a subscript on the LQ symbol in the third column of Table 1.
This particular notation was introduced in Ref. [9] for all LQs except for ¯S1

and ¯U1 states. (The only leptons that ¯S1 and ¯U1 can couple to are right-chiral
neutrinos. These, on the other hand, are not part of the SM ﬁeld content.) S3
and U3 LQs were denoted as (cid:126)S3 and (cid:126)U3, respectively, in the initial version of
Ref. [9]. In more recent studies a capital letter assigned to a given scalar (vector)
LQ is simply replaced with S (V ) [13]. Moreover, the SU (2) subscript (2j +1) of
the original notation, where j is the highest eigenvalue of I3 generator in a given
SU (2) representation, is simply replaced with j. The following correspondence
prescribes transition from one notation to the other: S3 ↔ S1, R2 ↔ S1/2,
˜R2 ↔ ˜S1/2, ˜S1 ↔ ˜S0, S1 ↔ S0, ¯S1 ↔ ¯S0, U3 ↔ V1, V2 ↔ V1/2, ˜V2 ↔ ˜V1/2,
˜U1 ↔ ˜V0, U1 ↔ U0, and ¯U1 ↔ ¯V0. Some authors denote S and V with S† and
V †, respectively. See, for example, section on LQs in Ref. [14].
The LQ hypercharge is easily deduced from group theory since it is an ad-
ditive quantity. Let us, for example, determine hypercharge of a scalar LQ
that transforms as triplet of both SU (3) and SU (2). This state can only be
contracted with quark and lepton doublets in gauge invariant way. The hy-
percharge of the quark-lepton contraction of doublet representations LL and
QL is (−1/2) + 1/6 = −1/3. This then implies that LQ that contracts with
LL and QL in gauge invariant manner has hypercharge 1/3, i.e., (1, 1, 0) ∈
(1, 2,−1/2) ⊗ (3, 2, 1/6) ⊗ (3, 3, 1/3).
There are six scalar and six vector LQ multiplets under the SM gauge group.
These comprise ten diﬀerent LQ states each if we disregard transformations un-
der SU (3). There are, however, only four possible (electric) charge assignments
LQs can have since they couple the up-type quarks (Q = ±2/3) or the down-
type quarks (Q = ±1/3) to the charged leptons (Q = ±1) or the neutral leptons
(Q = 0). These possible LQ charges are thus Q = ±5/3, Q = ±4/3, Q = ±2/3,
and Q = ±1/3. The upshot of this is that some ﬁelds from diﬀerent LQ mul-
tiplets can, in principle, couple to the same quark-lepton combination. These,
on the other hand, would very often provide indistinguishable (ﬁnal state) sig-

natures at modern colliders.

We put forward one mnemonic for scalar LQs. Note that S3 = (3, 3, 1/3)
comprises three states with electric charges Q = 4/3, Q = 1/3, and Q = −2/3.
These, conveniently enough, are exactly the electric charges and hypercharges
of three scalar LQs that are singlets of SU (2), i.e., ˜S1, S1, and ¯S1. Since the
SU (3) charge assignment is the same for these four LQs this fact allows for an
easy reconstruction of gauge transformation properties of three singlets using
the quantum numbers of S3.

LQs are often referred to as being of the ﬁrst, second or third generation type.
The idea behind this nomenclature is to name the LQ according to generation
of the charged lepton and quark it couples to. We ﬁnd this terminology to be
ambiguous. For example, LQ that couples to an electron and a down quark
certainly qualiﬁes to be of the ﬁrst generation type. But the same would be
true of an LQ that would couple to an electron and an up quark. We will,
nevertheless, use this nomenclature with care from time to time.

Let us now specify all possible renormalizable interactions of scalar and vec-
tor LQs with fermions. These interactions, excluding the ones related to the
right-chiral neutrinos, have been speciﬁed in Ref. [15]. The right-chiral neutrino
interactions, for the case of scalar LQs, have been discussed in Ref. [16]. LQs
(presumably) couple to gauge ﬁelds and the Higgs scalar of the SM. We do
not specify these couplings unless necessary. For full list of the LQ couplings
to photon, Z boson, and gluon ﬁelds we refer reader instead to Refs. [17, 18].
If more than one type of LQ multiplet is added to the SM the gauge symme-
try would allow interaction between these multiplets and the SM Higgs scalar.
The invariant LQ couplings with the Higgs scalar that correspond to such an
arrangement can be found in Ref. [19].

1.2. S3 = (3, 3, 1/3)

There are two operators that describe how scalar LQ S3 interacts with mat-

ter. They are

be written as ((cid:126)τ · (cid:126)S3). This is the reason why S3 was initially denoted as (cid:126)S3 in
Ref. [9]. It can be treated as an (iso)vector of the weak isospin.) We opt not to
display SU (3) indices. Superscript C stands for charge conjugation operation.
Our notation is such that for the fermion ﬁeld ψ we write ψL,R = PL,Rψ,
T , where PL,R = (1 ∓ γ5)/2 and C = iγ2γ0. We
ψ = ψ†γ0, and ψC = Cψ

the other hand, is antisymmetric in ﬂavor space, i.e., yij = −yji [16]. Matrices
x and y describe the strength of LQ interaction with fermions.

j (V C

Yukawa coupling matrix associated to quark-lepton-LQ coupling is some-
times assigned subscript to mark the chirality of a lepton [9]. To implement
this in Eq. (1) one would write xij → xL,ij. Some authors, on the other hand,
refer to the quark-lepton-LQ operator via chirality of both fermions.
If that
is adopted one would refer to the ﬁrst operator in Eq. (1) as an LL operator,
where the convention dictates that the chirality of the quark precedes that of
the lepton. We specify the LQ chirality properties in the fourth column of Ta-
ble 1. In fact, chirality properties of the LQ couplings to leptons of the SM have
also been used to classify LQs. The notation in question stipulates [20] that
all scalar (vector) LQs are denoted with SC
j ), where C denotes chirality of
the lepton and j represents the highest eigenvalue of I3 generator of SU (2) of
a given LQ multiplet. If two LQs have the same chirality and same j but diﬀer
in hypercharge U (1) one of them gets an additional tilde above the symbol. We
present this alternative notation in the fourth column of Table 1 next to cor-
responding chirality of the LQ couplings. Note that within the SM framework
this notation corresponds to fourteen diﬀerent possibilities for LQs to couple to
the quark-lepton pair. Seven of these are due to the scalar LQ couplings. There
are actually four more possibilities if one includes right-chiral neutrinos that
are equally shared between scalars and vectors. If the LQs couple exclusively
to either left- or right-chiral quarks they are referred to as left- and right-type
LQs [19], respectively. S3 clearly has only the left-type LQ couplings to quarks.
The second operator in Eq. (1) corresponds to a “diquark” coupling of S3.
If LQ does not possess “diquark” couplings due to the SM quantum number
assignment we refer to it as a genuine LQ [21]. LQs have well-deﬁned fermion
number F = 3B + L that is shown in the ﬁfth column of Table 1. In the absence
of the “diquark” couplings one could also assign B and L numbers to a given
LQ [15]. Interactions of genuine LQs could thus automatically conserve both B
and L at renormalizable level. One should, however, check that the assignment
in question is not in conﬂict with all possible renormalizable interactions between
a given LQ and the SM ﬁelds [22]. We postpone the discussion on baryon and
lepton numbers of LQs to the end of this section.

referred to as non-chiral LQ. R2 is thus a non-chiral LQ of genuine kind.

and R2/3

We have already outlined the ambiguity attached to the ﬁrst, second or third
generation LQ nomenclature. There is yet another aspect to this issue. Namely,
LQ multiplets that transform non-trivially under SU (2) can have one charged
component to be of the ﬁrst, second or third generation type but that would not
be the case with other charged component(s). This can be nicely illustrated with
this particular LQ. For example, R2/3
could be referred to as the ﬁrst generation
LQ if yij = yδ1iδ1j and xij = 0, i, j = 1, 2, 3, where δij is the Kronecker delta.
However, R5/3
2 would then be LQ that simultaneously couples an electron to all
up-type quarks. We implicitly assume that all unitary rotations in the ﬂavor
space of the right-chiral sector and the individual rotations of the left-chiral
sector are not physical.

Vector LQs are usually associated with carriers of new interactions. This
implies that xij in Eq. (11) can be identiﬁed with gauge couplings that measure
the strength of relevant interactions. These, on the other hand, are ﬂavor blind.
One can accordingly write xij = gδij, where g represents gauge coupling in
question. We again remind the reader that we assume that the right-chiral
sector rotations are not physical. The same assumption applies to individual
rotations in the left-chiral sector.
If that is not the case one needs to insert
unitary transformations of all chiral states where appropriate.

1.14. B and L considerations

LQs have well-deﬁned fermion number F = 3B + L. See, for example, ﬁfth
column of Table 1.
In the absence of the “diquark” couplings one could, in
principle, also assign B and L numbers to a given LQ in self-consistent manner.
This, on the other hand, would allow one to concentrate on the low-scale LQ
phenomenology of these states without the pressing need to address the issue of
matter stability. Note, however, that it might happen that the LQ in question
couples to other ﬁelds in the SM in both the gauge and Lorentz invariant way
that would violate self-consistency of the B and L assignment. For example,
even though ˜R2 does not possess “diquark” couplings it can couple to the Higgs
ﬁeld H of the SM via renormalizable operator H ˜R2 ˜R2 ˜R2. This, on the other
hand, would lead to the p → π+ π+ e− ν ν process [22]. We will, for the time
being, assume that this particular operator can be either neglected or altogether
forbidden by (some) symmetry.

There are two scalar LQs — R2 and ˜R2 — that do not possess “diquark”
couplings. The same statement is valid for vector LQs U3, ˜U1, U1, and ¯U1.
These six genuine LQ multiplets can all be assigned baryon number B = 1/3
and lepton number L = −1 if one considers only couplings to fermions. They
will be the primary focus of this review. One can easily single them out in
Table 1 as they all have F = 3B + L = 0. LQs with F = −2, on the other
hand, can mediate proton decay if one does not forbid the “diquark” coupling(s)
to make them purely LQs [23]. Strictly speaking, these statements hold true
within a framework comprising the SM and a single LQ state at renormalizable
level. Situation might be much more involved in any other framework.

2,µ , V 1/3

LQs that mediate proton decay and bound neutron decay at tree-level need
to be very heavy and/or some of their couplings to matter need to be extremely
small. Either way, they are irrelevant for low-energy phenomenology. The lower
bounds on the masses of the |F| = 2 vector LQs due to proton decay lifetime
data are particularly severe. These states have been extensively investigated
in the context of grand uniﬁed theories, where, again, V 4/3
2,µ , and
˜V −2/3
2,µ

are referred to as X, Y , X(cid:48), and Y (cid:48) gauge bosons, respectively.

2,µ , ˜V 1/3

Vector LQs couple to matter via gauge couplings. These couplings, on the
other hand, can be related to the measured gauge couplings and are thus well-
known in most of available models. The only thing that is a priori not deter-
mined are rotations in the left- and right-chiral sectors but these need to be
unitary. (See, for example, Eqs. (14) and (16).) The lower bound on the LQ
mass due to the matter stability constraints can be easily estimated on general
grounds. Let us denote the mass of proton decay mediating vector LQ or any
LQ for that matter to be mLQ. Relevant schematic diagram for two-body pro-
ton decay p → π0 e+ mediated by, for example, either V 1/3
is given
in the left panel of Fig. 1, where we take g to represent generic value of gauge
coupling strength. We also promote all unitary transformations of fermion ﬁelds
into identity matrices to make the most conservative estimate possible. The am-
plitude (decay width) associated with this process is proportional to g2/m2
(g4/m4

LQ). To get the dimensions right, one needs to introduce the only other

or ˜V 1/3

If we take g = 1/2, mp ≈ 1 GeV and τ exp.
> 1.0 × 1034 years [24] we get that
mLQ (cid:38) 1016 GeV. One can certainly reﬁne this constrain within a well-deﬁned
model but the scale we present is rather accurate.

To establish a lower bound on the mass of the |F| = 2 scalar LQs we proceed
in the same manner. Relevant schematic diagram for two-body proton decay
p → π0 e+ mediated by, for example, scalar LQ S1 is given in the right panel of
Fig. 1, where we take y to represent generic value of relevant Yukawa coupling(s).
This time the decay width reads

If we now associate y with Yukawa coupling of the up quark (y ≈ 10−5) we get
that mLQ (cid:38) 2×1011 GeV. Note that limits on scalar LQ mass are approximately
a factor of y/g weaker with respect to the limits on the mass of vector LQs.
There are ways to avoid and/or lower these stringent bounds even within the
framework that only allows for three generations of the SM fermions. One can,
for example, use unitary transformations to partially suppress [25] and/or com-
pletely rotate away proton decay due to the vector LQ mediation for some [26] or
all available decay channels [27] at leading order. Proton decay through scalar
LQ exchange involves dependence on Yukawa couplings. This makes it even
more model dependent when compared with the vector LQ case. It can conse-
quently be completely or partially suppressed with a suitable choice of the LQ
couplings to matter [5, 28]. Also, some of scalar LQs generate suppressed contri-
butions to proton decay due to intrinsic particularities of their ﬂavor structure.
This, for example, is the case with ˜S1 that has antisymmetric couplings to the
up-type quark bilinears [29, 28, 30]. There are also numerous ways to forbid the
“diquark” coupling(s) altogether.

It has been recently argued that even the SM extension with a single scalar
LQ multiplet R2 or ˜R2 could yield an unacceptably high level of baryon number

violation if one allows operators of dimension ﬁve that are suppressed by the
Planck scale and that feature couplings of order one [30]. For example, R2 can
couple to two down-type quarks and the Higgs ﬁeld (H) via the dimension ﬁve
operator to generate proton decay. See, for example, Fig. 2 for a representative
diagram. It has also been shown that this class of operators can be forbidden
in a systematic way [30], if needed.

Since this is a review on LQs in precision experiments and at particle colliders
we will not delve much deeper into these issues unless absolutely necessary. For
exhaustive reviews on proton decay see, for example, Refs. [31, 5].

2. Leptoquark models

LQs are ﬁelds that are a natural outcome of uniﬁcation of quarks and lep-
tons [1] as initially proposed in the Pati-Salam model [2]. It was clear from the
very onset that they would turn quarks into leptons and accordingly generate
qualitatively new physical eﬀects. This notion has been further supported with
a successful uniﬁcation of quarks and leptons into simple groups of SU (5) [32]
and SO(10) [33, 34], where the exchange of vector LQs was shown to lead to yet
to be observed physical process of proton and bound neutron decay.

Uniﬁcation of leptons and quarks into the same representation requires uni-
ﬁcation of scalar LQ(s) with the SM Higgs boson if one resorts to simple groups.
These scalar LQs very often tend to mediate proton decay. This is in fact the
source of the so-called doublet-triplet splitting problem we referred to when we
discussed Yukawa couplings of scalar LQ S1 in Section 1. Namely, one must
address the fact that the SM Higgs boson, a doublet of SU (2), has to be light
whereas an associated LQ, a triplet of SU (3), needs to be very heavy to satisfy
experimental constraints on the proton lifetime. The mass splitting of this mag-
nitude is highly unnatural especially since both the doublet and the triplet reside

15

ydνuLQsλuuHin the same representation. This proved to be very challenging and has led to an
alternative way to unify fermions into a ﬂipped SU (5) framework [35, 36, 37, 38]
that is based on an SU (5) × U (1) embedding of the SM ﬁelds.
We will demonstrate with explicit models that the potential lightness of
scalar LQs in the context of grand uniﬁed theories, if LQs are phenomenologi-
cally allowed to reside at low scale, is usually directly connected to viable gauge
coupling uniﬁcation. Naturally, it is necessary and sometimes diﬃcult in view
of preceding comments to insure that the light LQ scenario is compatible with
proton (and bound neutron) stability.

Introduction of supersymmetry (SUSY) has also opened a door to a rich
LQ phenomenology. A closer look at the SM fermion transformation properties
shows that scalar partners of all quarks carry correct quantum numbers to couple
quarks to leptons the way LQs do. The actual realisation of these scenarios
within SUSY framework, though, requires explicit R-parity violation to facilitate
necessary couplings [39, 40, 41]. (For the proposal on how to embed R-violating
interactions in a grand uniﬁed theory framework see, for example, Ref. [41].)
This is an extremely reach subject that partially overlaps with the scope of
present review. We do not, however, intend to cover physics of R-parity violation
and instead point the reader to extensive reviews on the subject [42, 43, 44].

LQs also appear within technicolor scenarios [45, 46, 47] and composite mod-
els [48, 49], where one expects them to be at a suﬃciently low energy scale that
is directly accessible with modern colliders. An example of how scalar LQs can
arise as pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons of a spontaneously broken, approx-
imate symmetry, within the Pati-Salam embedding can be found in Ref. [50].
Phenomenology of the third generation LQs in models where electroweak sym-
metry breaking is driven by strong dynamics, and strategies on how to look for
these states at the LHC have been discussed in Ref. [51]. Phenomenology of
light LQs has also been discussed within superstring theory that is compacti-
ﬁed on a Calabi-Yau manifold [52]. LQs have also been proposed to transmit
spontaneous CP breaking to quarks and leptons of the SM in models that aim
to solve the strong CP problem [53].

Finally, there are scenarios that are extensions of the SM that simply add
one or more LQs and possibly some other ﬁelds to the experimentally observed
ones in order to address certain phenomenological issue(s) such as the origin
of neutrino mass, to name one example. We will discuss this type of scenarios
towards the end of this section.

2.1. Uniﬁcation scenarios

One can say with certainty that any uniﬁcation leads to appearance of LQs.
The real question from the theoretical point of view is whether these LQs can be
or are predicted to be light enough to be relevant for the low-energy phenomenol-
ogy. (Potential embedding of light LQs into SUSY and non-SUSY grand uniﬁed
theory scenarios has been discussed, for example, in Ref. [54].) Our intention is
to discuss models of gauge uniﬁcation that predict light LQs. We will accord-
ingly start with the LQs in SU (5) gauge group since the language of SU (5) is
often used to simplify discussions of more complicated frameworks. Before we

Table 2: List of SU (5) representations (right column) that accommodate LQs (left column).

proceed we list in Table 2 the most commonly used representations in SU (5)
that also accommodate LQs. In what follows we denote representations through
their dimensionality using conventions of Ref. [55].

i , uC

The SM fermions comprise three ten-dimensional representations (10i) and
three ﬁve-dimensional representations (5j), where i, j(= 1, 2, 3) are family in-
dices. Namely, 10i ≡ (1, 1, 1)i ⊕ (3, 1,−2/3)i ⊕ (3, 2, 1/6)i = (eC
i , Qi)
j ) [32]. Note that all of the
and 5j ≡ (1, 2,−1/2)j ⊕ (3, 1, 1/3)j = (Lj, dC
SM fermions in a given SU (5) multiplet are left-chiral.
(This allows us to
drop the chirality subscript that we use throughout Section 1.) All potentially
relevant contractions of these representations in the SU (5) group space read
10 ⊗ 10 = 5 ⊕ 45 ⊕ 50, 10 ⊗ 5 = 5 ⊕ 45, and 5 ⊗ 5 = 10 ⊕ 15. It is now
easy to single out those scalar representations that can directly couple to two
fermion ﬁelds at the renormalizable level. These are the 5-, 10-, 15-, 45-, and
50-dimensional representations. On the other hand, the only scalar represen-
tations that contain ﬁelds capable of getting vacuum expectation value (VEV)
without breaking electric charge and color are 5-, 15-, 24-, and 45-dimensional
representations. Even though 24-dimensional representation does not contain
scalar LQs we note that vector LQs in SU (5) reside in an adjoint representa-
tion. This simply means that the only vector LQ that always appears in SU (5)
is V2. (Again, V 4/3
2 — two LQs comprising the SM multiplet V2 —
are referred to as X and Y gauge bosons, respectively. See Eq. (13) for relevant
couplings of these ﬁelds with matter.) Since at least one scalar representation
with LQs needs to be present in the concrete model to generate electroweak
symmetry breaking and fermion masses we can state with certainty that there
is always at least one vector and one scalar LQ in any scenario that is based on
the SU (5) gauge group.

and V 1/3

If the SU (5) scenario is realised with the minimal scalar content there would
be two LQs in the theory and both would need to be superheavy. For example,

the most stringent experimental limit on the mass of V2 in the Georgi-Glashow
model [32] originates from two-body proton decay p → π0e+. The ﬂavor depen-
dent part of the proton decay width in this channel in the minimal SU (5) model
is equal to (1 + |1 + |Vud|2|2), where |Vud| ∼ 1 is the 11 element of |VCKM|. (In
ﬂipped SU (5) the ﬂavor dependent part of p → π0e+ process mediated by ˜V2
gauge boson is |Vud|4 [35].) In a more realistic setting with regard to fermion
masses this term can be completely rotated away. However, one cannot simul-
taneously suppress all two-body proton decay channels in SU (5) [25]. (One can
actually suppress all relevant channels in ﬂipped SU (5) [27].) In particular, phe-
nomenologically viable suppression in SU (5) cannot drive ﬂavor dependent term
for proton decaying into an s-meson and a muon below a value of 2|Vub|2 [26],
where |Vub| ∼ 0.004 is the 13 element of |VCKM|. Even with this level of sup-
pression one would get a lower bound on the mass of V2 to be of the order of
1013 GeV. The point is that V2 within the SU (5) framework is irrelevant for the
low-energy phenomenology except for proton decay.

u + m2

The lower bound on the scalar LQ mass can also be derived. If one takes
the Georgi-Glashow model [32] but allows for realistic fermion masses through
higher-dimensional operators it can be shown [56] that the mass limit is gener-
ated by the experimental bound on the partial lifetime for p → K +ν channel.
It depends only on one a priori unknown phase φ via a term proportional to
d + 2mumd cos φ)−1/4, where mu and md are the up quark and the
(m2
down quark masses, respectively. This result implies that the mass of the scalar
LQ S1 needs to be above 2.4 × 1011 GeV for the SU (5) model to be viable with
certainty. Here we present the limit using τp→K+ν > 5.9 × 1033 years [57]. (In
the minimal ﬂipped SU (5) scenario the corresponding limit on the scalar LQ S1
mass from p → K +ν channel is 1012 GeV [28].) The main message of this dis-
cussion is that presence of light LQs in any scenario that is based on the SU (5)
gauge group requires additional scalar representations beside those of the min-
imal model. (The ﬁrst study of the light scalar LQ phenomenology within the
SU (5) framework can be found in Ref. [8].)

Let us ﬁnally give an example of how (very) light scalar LQs might appear in
SU (5). We describe a model presented in Ref. [58]. The authors start with the
Georgi-Glashow model and add to it one 5-dimensional and two 10-dimensional
scalar representations. The Georgi-Glashow (GG) model [32] itself consists of
matter ﬁelds — 10i and 5i (i = 1, 2, 3) — and scalars comprising one 24-
and one 5-dimensional representation to start with. All vector bosons, on the
other hand, reside in one 24-dimensional representation. The VEV of the scalar
adjoint breaks SU (5) down to SU (3) × SU (2) × U (1) and the fundamental
scalar representation is there to provide electroweak symmetry breaking, i.e.,
SU (3)× SU (2)× U (1) → SU (3)× U (1)em. The authors of Ref. [58] proceed by
assuming the validity of the “desert hypothesis” which stipulates that the ﬁelds
are either superheavy or very light. The only light ﬁelds beside the SM fermions
and gauge bosons are, by assumption, two multiplets in 5-dimensional (10-
dimensional) scalar representations that transform as (1, 2, 1/2) ((3, 2, 1/6)).
This particular ﬁeld content and these assumptions lead to uniﬁcation of gauge
couplings if the additional scalar ﬁelds reside at the electroweak scale. We show

Figure 3: Running of gauge couplings with the SM particle content (solid lines) and with ad-
ditional ﬁelds (dashed lines) comprising one scalar transforming as (1, 2, 1/2) and two scalars

framework (solid lines) with one Higgs scalar and confront it with the uniﬁcation
scenario when additional scalar ﬁelds are taken to be at the common scale of
102 GeV (dashed lines). To produce Fig. 3 we use α3 = 0.1176, α−1
em = 127.906,
and sin2 θW = 0.23122 [59], where these (central) values are given at MZ in the
M S scheme. g3, g2, and g1 are couplings associated with SU (3), SU (2), and
U (1) gauge groups, respectively.

Admittedly, the model of Ref. [58] is not (any more) phenomenologically
viable for multiple reasons. We, nevertheless, opt to present this scenario since
it provides a kind of connection between the uniﬁcation scale and the scalar
LQ mass scale that persists in other models that predict light LQs. Scalar LQs
simply need to be light if couplings are to unify.

The model of Ref. [58] can be furthermore used to demonstrate how dif-
ﬁcult it is to insure matter stability. Namely, there are multiple operators
that should be suppressed if one is to prevent rapid proton decay. For exam-
ple, the contraction αβγδη10αβ10γδ10ην5ν of four scalar representations yields
an operator that involves three LQs ((3, 2, 1/6) = ˜R2) and one Higgs ﬁeld
((1, 2, 1/2) = H) that could eventually lead to p → π+ π+ e− ν ν process [22].
(See discussion in Section 1 for details.) Here, αβγδη is Levi-Civita tensor and
α, β, γ, δ, η, ν(= 1, . . . , 5) are SU (5) indices. Moreover, if one allows for contrac-
tion 5α10αβ5β of scalar representations 5(= (H, S1)) with two 10-dimensional
scalar representations that diﬀers from zero when there is more than one 5 one
can get contribution to proton decay that is shown in Fig. 4 [60]. Of course,
it might be possible to forbid all problematic operators using additional sym-

metries. However, these symmetries would be external to the underlying gauge
group and would thus add complexity to the model.

Note that additional representations in the previous example are introduced
for the sole purpose of improving uniﬁcation. There are, however, scenarios that
have additional representations beside those in the GG model that do not only
improve some of its shotcomings but also predict existence of light LQs in a self-
consistent manner along the way. For example, the model presented in Ref. [61]
extends the GG model with only one 15-dimensional scalar representation. The
VEV of electrically neutral ﬁeld in 15(≡ (1, 3, 1) ⊕ (6, 1,−2/3) ⊕ (3, 2, 1/6))
generates experimentally observed neutrino masses while all the multiplets in
15 help establish gauge coupling uniﬁcation. The operator responsible for neu-
trino masses is xij5i α15αβ5j β, where xij is symmetric matrix in ﬂavor space.
One of the ﬁelds in 15-dimensional scalar representation that transforms as
(3, 2, 1/6) ≡ ˜R2 turns out to be rather light in order for uniﬁcation to take
place at suﬃciently high energy scale. The model thus connects proton decay
physics to the phenomena that can be probed at LHC. The phenomenology of
this model that relies on higher-dimensional contributions to generate viable
charged fermion masses has accordingly been extensively studied [61, 62, 63].
(Available parameter space of the model is shown in Fig. 1 of Ref. [63].) The
model, furthermore, connects neutrino masses and mixing parameters with the
LQ decay pattern. This feature has been exploited to show that LQ decay sig-
natures depend on the possible neutrino mass hierarchies in a testable way [64].
Another possible class of SU (5) models that might yield light scalar LQs
is the one that resorts to 45-dimensional scalar representation to address the
observed diﬀerence between down-type quark masses and charged lepton masses
in a manner initially proposed by Georgi and Jarlskog [65]. Note that three
out of six scalar LQs reside in 45-dimensional representation as can be seen
in Table 2. This representation has two renormalizable contractions with the
SM fermions. These are xijαβγδη10αβ
αβ, where
x and y are coupling matrices in ﬂavor space. The former operator generates an
antisymmetric contribution to the up-type quark masses [66] whereas the latter
one yields contributions to the down-type quark masses and charged lepton

dimensional representation might be light if one completely suppresses operator
proportional to x or makes x symmetric in ﬂavor space [28]. (See Table II in
Ref. [28] for explicit couplings of the LQs to fermions due to SU (5) contractions.)
In fact, it has been shown that phenomenologically viable scenario of SU (5)
uniﬁcation with one 45-dimensional scalar representation that was introduced
in Ref. [67] yields light LQ ˜S1 with a mass around 1 TeV [21]. This regime when
˜S1 is accessible at LHC was further investigated in Ref. [68].

The possibility that one could have a scalar LQ that is light within the
context of SO(10) uniﬁcation has been pursued in Ref. [69]. It has been shown
that a particular chain of symmetry breaking results in a collider accessible
LQ. Note that the SO(10) framework involves two sets of vector LQs — V2
and ˜V2 — that reside in 45-dimensional representation of SO(10).
In view
of our discussion on matter stability within the context of SU (5) and ﬂipped
SU (5) they both need to be superheavy in the most conservative scenario. The
point is that if one wants to construct self-consistent model of uniﬁcation with
light vector LQs one needs to look beyond simple groups of SU (5) or SO(10).
(See, for example, Refs. [70, 71, 72] for explicit model realizations within an
SU (15) framework.) SO(10) gauge symmetry, on the other hand, allows for
multiple scalar LQs to be light if needed. For example, the SU (5) operator
that was discussed in the previous paragraph can be
xijαβγδη10αβ
embedded into an SO(10) operator xij16i16j126, where three 16-dimensional
representations contain the SM fermions and three right-chiral neutrinos while
126-dimensional representation is the relevant scalar representation containing
LQs. The SO(10) symmetry insures symmetricity of xij in ﬂavor space which
might allow for S3 and ˜S1 LQs that reside in 126 to be light. The absence of
the “diquark” couplings for both S3 and ˜S1 in 126 of SO(10) is simply due to
the underlying gauge symmetry of the model.

i 10γδ

j 45ην
ν

One can get light vector LQs in scenarios that do not exclusively rely on
the use of simple groups. A prime example of potentially light vector LQ in
the literature is (3, 1, 5/3) ≡ U1. It is a vector LQ that is not dangerous for
proton decay. Also, it is a part of the gauge sector of the Pati-Salam model [2].
The mass of U1 is thus associated with the scale of the Pati-Salam SU (4) color
gauge group breaking into the color group of the SM. The coupling strength of
the Pati-Salam LQ to matter is consequently determined by the strength of the
QCD coupling at the Pati-Salam symmetry breaking scale. (See Eq. (18) for
relevant couplings of U1 to matter.)

Low scale quark-lepton uniﬁcation that predicts existence of both vector
and scalar LQs has been presented in Ref. [73]. The uniﬁcation is based on the
SU (4)C × SU (2)L × U (1)R gauge group product and it stipulates that scalar
LQs could be accessible at the LHC and in the IceCube experiment [74]. The
scalar LQs in question are SU (2) doublets R2 and ˜R2. The model also addresses
the nature of neutrino mass that is of Majorana type through an inverse seesaw
mechanism.

21

2.2. Low-scale scenarios of neutrino mass

LQs have been used to address the question of neutrino masses and associ-
ated mixing parameters within extensions of the SM that do not necessarily aim
or lead to uniﬁcation. Namely, it has been stipulated that the neutrino masses
are of the one-loop or two-loop origin, where all or some of the ﬁelds that partic-
ipate in the loops are LQs. This approach is used to naturally explain or justify
observed smallness of neutrino masses. We give several explicit realisations of
this approach in what follows.

The one-loop scenario presented in Ref. [75] studies potential contributions
of three scalar LQs — S3, S1, and ˜R2 — towards neutrino masses. The idea is
to couple these LQs to the quark-lepton pairs but to allow only those couplings
where the quark in question is either of left- or right-chiral nature. The scenario
then introduces mixing between diﬀerent LQs that is due to the coupling of
S3- ˜R2 and S1- ˜R2 multiplet pairs to the Higgs boson of the SM. It is this mixing
that generates non-chiral Yukawa couplings of physical LQs and consequently
induces small neutrino masses of the Majorana type through loop eﬀects. Note
that S1 is a non-chiral LQ and the realisation of proposed scenario requires one
to forbid certain couplings that are otherwise allowed by the symmetry of the
SM. One also needs to forbid “diquark” couplings to prevent rapid proton decay.
The proposed scenario of Ref. [75] has used experimental results on neutrino
oscillations to constrain speciﬁc combinations of LQ couplings to quark-lepton
pairs and to the Higgs boson as a function of LQ masses.

Neutrino mass generation at the one-loop level by LQ exchange has also been
studied in Ref. [76]. The proposed scenario establishes a link between the LQ
decay pattern and Yukawa couplings that are responsible for the neutrino mass
matrix. Consequentially, measured neutrino data are used to predict several
decay branching ratios of LQ states that can be tested at LHC. The authors
of Ref. [76] single out large lepton ﬂavor violating rates in muon and tau ﬁnal
states as the most interesting signatures of the proposed scenario.

One-loop model of Majorana neutrino mass that employs S3 and ˜R2 LQs
is presented in Ref. [77]. The one-loop diagram of neutrino mass generation is
given in Fig. 5. Note that the states S1/3
mix through the coupling
with the Higgs boson and that the scalar state that is in the loop is a mixture
of these two components. The model of Ref. [77] uses the same LQ multiplets
that help generate neutrino mass to address the observed anomaly in RK [78]
by the LHCb Collaboration [79].

and ˜R−1/3 ∗

Neutrino mass generation that relies on LQs can also be at the two-loop
level [80]. This approach can even better justify observed smallness of the
relevant mass parameters than the one-loop level approach. This particular
possibility has been pursued in the supersymmetric version of the SM with the
use of speciﬁc R-parity violating couplings [80]. Another model of radiatively
induced neutrino mass at the two-loop level that uses scalar LQs in the TeV
range is given in Ref. [81]. See Fig. 6 for a representative two-loop diagram with
the gauge boson in the loop. (There is one more contribution to the neutrino
masses that involves the Higgs scalar in the loop. See Fig. 1 of Ref. [81].)

The proposed LQs of the model — S1 and ˜R2 — mix through the SM Higgs
boson. They are accessible at the LHC and their decay branching ratios can
probe neutrino oscillation parameters [81]. The presence of these LQs can also
substantially aﬀect both the single and the pair Higgs productions as shown in
Ref. [82]. The two-loop models of neutrino masses that use LQs that could be
accessible at LHC have also been studied in Refs. [83, 84].

Recently, three systematic studies of radiatively induced neutrino mass mod-
els that also include the LQ loop scenarios have been conducted. The ﬁrst one
places an emphasis on the predictions related to the LHC physics [85]. The
second one has studied in detail the two-loop realisations of the Majorana neu-
trino mass [86] and the third work emphasises the connection between double
beta decay and neutrino mass models [87]. (For a mechanism that leads to the
neutrinoless double beta decay through the exchange of either scalar or vector
LQs see Ref. [88].)

2.3. Flavor models

If the LQs do not couple to diquarks there is no eminent danger of proton
decay. Also, the ﬂavor constraints usually allow for light LQs if these couple
diagonally and in chiral manner to the fermions in the mass eigenstate basis. The
model that uses horizontal symmetry, i.e., symmetry that distinguishes fermion

of type S1 has been proposed in Ref. [89]. It is a supersymmetric scenario that is
based on a horizontal symmetry that consists of Z8×Z7 ⊂ U (1)H1 ×U (1)H2 and
three leptonic quantum numbers, where U (1)H1 and U (1)H2 are QCD anomaly
free groups. The same horizontal symmetry is used to address the hierarchy of
quark mass matrices.

A possibility to discriminate between diﬀerent models of ﬂavor that repro-
duce the observed mixing parameters in the lepton sector through data on rare
decays has been investigated in Ref. [90]. The authors adapted frameworks
with non-Abelian ﬂavor symmetries that simultaneously yield experimentally
viable leptonic mixing matrix and explain lepton-nonuniversality as observed
throughthe RK anomaly [79]. This is a bottom-up approach, where the pattern
of the LQ couplings to matter manifests itself through the observable eﬀects in
lepton ﬂavor violation and lepton-nonuniversality processes.

It has been suggested in Ref. [91] that a minimal extension of the SM with
one scalar LQ can provide an explanation of RD(∗) [92], RK, and (g − 2) of
muon [93] observables. The authors of Ref. [91] use S1 to simultaneously ad-
dress the measured values of the aforementioned physical observables that are
in disagreement with the SM predictions with the S1 LQ mass of the order of
1 TeV and with order one couplings to quarks and leptons that are doublets
of SU (2) of the SM. The couplings are taken to be generation-diagonal. The
presence of S1 allows the authors of Ref. [91] to address the RD(∗) anomalies at
the tree level, while the RK contributions are generated at loop level. Note that
S1 could have “diquark” couplings and accordingly mediate proton decay. (A
detailed discussion of individual contributions of scalar and vector LQs towards
the muon magnetic moment can be found, for example, in Ref. [94].) A possible
resolution of RK and RD(∗) puzzles through the use of vector LQ U3 has been
proposed in Ref. [95].

Two simple extensions of the SM that aim at addressing the RK anomaly
through physics of LQs have been presented in Ref. [96]. First extension calls
for the SM with one scalar LQ that transforms as ˜R2, where the LQ in question
couples to electrons. Second extension is the SM and a LQ S3 that couples
to muons. Note that the authors of Ref. [96] consider very speciﬁc sets of
couplings of LQs to matter that prevent one from identifying them to be of
the ﬁrst, second or third generation type. Scalar LQ of S3 type that arises
as a pseudo-Goldstone boson of the strong dynamics has been used to address
the RK anomaly in Ref. [97]. New physics contributions due to exchange of
scalar LQs R2 and ˜R2 towards rare decays of B mesons have been studied in
Ref. [98]. The RK anomaly has also been addressed through physics of scalar
LQs in Ref. [99].

Finally, ﬂavor models that can provide an explanation of the observed en-
hancement of the ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν rates with respect to the SM predictions through
scalar and/or vector LQ(s) have been pursued in Ref. [100].

3. Leptoquark eﬀects on low energy physics of ﬂavor and CP violation

LQs have renormalizable complex couplings to two SM fermions and can
thus be probed in low energy experiments measuring rare ﬂavor changing and
CP violating processes. The most stringent limits are expected from observ-
ables to which the LQs contribute at tree level and involve both quarks and
leptons: leptonic and semi-leptonic meson decays, semi-leptonic τ decays, and
µ-e conversion in nuclei. Numerous constraints on such two-quark two-lepton
eﬀective interactions have been analyzed in Ref. [101]. However, LQs can also
contribute in loops, generating contributions to electric and magnetic dipole
moments of quarks and leptons, rare radiative decays of mesons and leptons as
well as neutral meson anti-meson oscillations.

In principle more than one LQ state could exist at low energies. Low energy
observables can consequently receive simultaneous and potentially interfering
contributions from several LQs. Since the resulting phenomenology becomes
very model dependent, in the following we focus on low energy eﬀects of single
LQ exchange and derive limits on the corresponding LQ couplings assuming they
represent the only signiﬁcant contribution to the relevant observables beyond the
SM. We do not assume any ﬂavor structure or alignment of the LQ couplings
with the SM Yukawas. The hypothesis of minimal ﬂavor violation has been
applied to LQ scenarios in Ref. [102].

Finally, LQs furnishing non-trivial SU (2) representations can exhibit mass
splittings among their weak multiplet mass eigenstates. Thus in principle their
contributions to low energy observables could be suppressed by varying mass
scales. In practice however, sizable inter-multiplet mass splittings are severely
constrained by electroweak precision observables (cf. Section 4.2.2).
In the
remainder of this section we therefore neglect such eﬀects and present all low
energy constraints as functions of a single LQ mass. Note however that most
individual observables receive contributions from only one of the LQ multiplet
components. Constraints derived from those observables can thus easily be
rescaled, taking into account possible inter-multiplet LQ mass hierarchies.

3.1. Semileptonic charged current processes

The direct tree-level probes of the LQ eﬀects are the semileptonic charged
current processes, whereas purely hadronic or leptonic charged processes must
proceed via higher perturbative order which results in reduced sensitivity to LQ
couplings.

Charged current processes can be induced by baryon number conserving
(F = 0) LQ states R2, ˜R2, U3, and U1, whose common feature is that they
all contain a 2/3 charged state. On the other hand, the baryon number vio-
lating states S3, S1, V2, ˜V2 entail charged currents via exchange of Q = 1/3
components [103]. In the presence of one of the abovelisted LQs the suitable

In this section we use the following shorthand notation for the mixing matrices in
the quark and lepton sector: V ≡ VCKM and U ≡ VPMNS. In Eq. (23) the indices
i, j, (cid:96), k refer to the fermion mass eigenstates. In the SM limit only the term
proportional to VijU(cid:96)k survives and results in lepton ﬂavor universal process
rates, when these are summed over undetected neutrino ﬂavor k. Modiﬁcations
of the left-handed currents, parametrized by gL, are expected in the presence
of LQs that transform either as singlets or triplets under SU (2). On the other
hand, the right-handed currents proportional to gR are distinct signature of
weak singlet LQ states. Further operators involving chirality ﬂipping currents
are possible in the presence of LQ states and are parameterized by couplings
ij;(cid:96)k, where X and Y refer to chiralities of the up-type quark and charged
gXY
lepton, respectively. (The chiralities of the down-type quark and the neutrino
are then determined as being opposite to chiralities of the up-type quark and
ij;(cid:96)k multiplies an operator that is composed
charged lepton, respectively. E.g., gRL
of right-handed up-type quark and left-handed charged lepton.) Pair of scalar
and tensor couplings (gRR, hRR) has a common origin in a single operator in
the Fierzed basis that is characteristic of non-chiral LQ scenarios. The same
holds true for the pair (gLL, hLL). At the matching scale the two couplings are
related as gRR(LL) = ±4hRR(LL), where minus sign applies for LQ states with
F = 2. Finally, eﬀective couplings gLR and gRL can be non-zero only when a
vector LQ state is integrated out.

The tree-level matching procedure is performed for each LQ at the matching
scale, which is here taken to be the mass mLQ of the LQ state being integrated
out, and results in a subset of eﬀective couplings which are laid out in Table 3.
The quoted expressions are in accord with the couplings notation established
in Section 1. The derivation of the expressions contained in Table 3 is straight-
forward: ﬁrst one writes down the tree-level LQ exchange amplitude in the
leading order in q2/m2
LQ expansion where q2 is the momentum ﬂow through the
LQ propagator and mLQ is the LQ mass. LQ exchanges lead to eﬀective four-
fermion operators in the operator basis that is Fierzed with respect to (23) and
one has to be careful in the matching procedure to take into account an extra
minus sign that comes from diﬀerent ordering of fermionic operators acting on
asymptotic states in the LQ model and in the eﬀective theory (23) calculation.

26

The most transparent procedure that takes care of the sign due to fermionic per-
mutations is to Fierz-transform the fermionic operators on the level of eﬀective
operators (23) and then perform the matching. Furthermore, the amplitude
for the LQ states with F = 2 will contain currents with charge-conjugated
spinors. In such cases one ﬁrst expresses the relevant eﬀective operator in terms
of charge-conjugated ﬁelds and only then applies the Fierz transformation. To
achieve that one invokes a transpose relation of ﬁeld bilinears:
2 = ±ψ2 (γω ··· γβγα) ψC
1 .

(24)
The plus (minus) sign in Eq. (24) applies for even (odd) number of γ matrices
between the two ﬁelds.

¯ψ1 (γαγβ ··· γω) ψC

The values of Wilson coeﬃcients in Table 3 are valid at the scale mLQ. In or-
der to re-sum potential large logarithmic eﬀects due to the running of the QCD
gauge coupling and to make predictions for experimentally measured quanti-
ties, they have to be run to the characteristic scales of the relevant hadronic
processes. The renormalization group eﬀects of QCD multiplicatively renormal-
ize the scalar and tensor coeﬃcients of the Lagrangian (23), while the vector
currents are not renormalized. At the leading logarithmic order the set of scalar
couplings runs with the anomalous dimension of the mass term:

Here XY = LL, RR, LR, RL and f is the number of quarks lighter than scale

reads β(n)
0 = 11 − 2n/3 [104], where n is the number of active quark ﬂavors.
Analogous relation holds for the tensor couplings hRR,LL
ij;(cid:96)k with the appropriate
change γS → γT = 8/3 [105].
A comment related to the unobservability of PMNS matrix eﬀects is in order
here. In Table 3 we list the eﬀective couplings for neutrino mass eigenstates
whereas experimentally one cannot diﬀerentiate between neutrino species. We
have consistently imposed a convention where the couplings to the left-handed
lepton doublets are deﬁned in the mass eigenstate basis of charged leptons. Left-
handed neutrino in the ﬁnal eigenstate k is thus always accompanied by U(cid:96)k,
where (cid:96) refers to a charged lepton. The rates for k = 1, 2, 3 are then summed
employing the unitarity of the PMNS matrix and the ﬁnal rate is equal to the
prediction of a theory with massless neutrinos and no mixing, i.e., U = 1 [21].
3.1.1. P → (cid:96)− ¯ν
The leptonic decays P → (cid:96)− ¯ν of charged pseudoscalar mesons are among
the most sensitive probes of the presence of light LQs. The distinct helicity
suppression of the left-handed current operators in the SM and their lepton
universality make these decays very sensitive to LQs. The only hadronic input
relevant to leptonic decays is a decay constant, deﬁned via

(cid:104)0| ¯uiγµγ5dj | P (p)(cid:105) = ifP pµ,

Scalar operators that arise in the presence of non-chiral LQ states lift the helicity
suppression with the charged lepton mass, present in vector operators. Early
studies showed that non-chiral LQs can easily violate the bound from leptonic
decays of pions, K, and D mesons [3, 106, 11, 12, 4]. In the kaon sector one
e/µ that also turns out to be very constraining [95], where
deﬁnes a similar ratio RK

= (2.477±0.001)×10−5 [107].
Leptonic decays of Ds → (cid:96)¯ν in presence of light scalar LQs have been studied
in [103, 109, 110, 21]. Pion leptonic decays π → e¯ν, µ¯ν have been studied as
subsidiary constraints in the context of LQ models in Ref. [111]. Ref. [112]
sets the various ﬂavor constraints on the ˜S1 Yukawa couplings, resulting in a
prediction of B → τ ¯ν. The authors of Ref. [113] made predictions for the
Bc → τ ¯ν branching fraction in relation to B → D(∗)τ ¯ν in the presence of scalar
R2.
3.1.2. τ → νP
The amplitude for the τ → νP decay is a crossed version of the one of P → (cid:96)ν

allows one to extend the lepton ﬂavor universality ratio with light pseudoscalar
P to the third lepton generation, e.g.,

Branching fractions themselves provide a good handle only on the LQ Yukawas
since they are competing with large tree-level SM contributions that suﬀer from
uncertainties in the hadronic matrix elements and from experimental errors.
Again, the lepton universality ratios Γ(P → P (cid:48)(cid:96)1ν)/Γ(P → P (cid:48)(cid:96)2ν) are superior
in precision over individual branching fractions and spectra. A notable exam-
ple is the semileptonic lepton ﬂavor universality (LFU) ratio RD ≡ Γ( ¯B →
Dτ ¯ν)/Γ( ¯B → D(cid:96)¯ν) comparing the τ and light lepton couplings with large pre-
cision. It has been shown that scalar [116, 113, 117, 118, 91, 119, 100] as well
as vector LQs [100, 119, 95, 120] may signiﬁcantly alter this LFU ratio.

3.1.4. P → V (cid:96)− ¯ν
As an example of semileptonic decays with vector mesons in the ﬁnal state we
shall use the decays B → D∗(cid:96)¯ν. The most interesting experimental observable
is the analogue of RD, but deﬁned for vector meson in the ﬁnal state:

RD∗ = B( ¯B → D∗τ− ¯ν)
B( ¯B → D∗(cid:96)− ¯ν)

(36)

with (cid:96) = e, µ.

In the case of B → D∗τ ¯ν decays the helicity amplitudes formalism is a
convenient description that is commonly used [121, 122, 123, 124, 125]. First
one needs to parametrize matrix elements of the weak currents for the B →
D∗ transition. Standard parametrization of vector and axial hadronic matrix
elements for the B → D∗ transition is given by

The number of observables in the case RD∗ is much larger than in the case of
RD as discussed already by many authors [121, 122, 123, 124, 100, 125, 119].
Based on current results on RD and RD∗, the authors of Ref. [100] have found
best ﬁt point for the coupling gL = 0.18 ± 0.04. The invariant dilepton mass
distribution can be obtained after performing integration over the angle θτ in
(44), as discussed in Refs. [121, 123, 100, 125, 118].

3.2. Rare meson decays

The mechanisms of LQ contributions to rare meson decays diﬀers qualita-
tively from the mechanism of rare SM decays. By rare decays we mean here
decays with neutral quark and lepton currents (¯q(cid:48)q)(¯(cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:96)) or (¯q(cid:48)q)(¯ν(cid:48)ν) that are
induced exclusively via loop diagrams and are suppressed by the unitarity of
the CKM matrix (GIM mechanism) or are even absent (lepton ﬂavor violation)
in the SM. The competing LQ amplitudes can be induced at the tree-level and
present a very serious constraint on the ﬂavor changing LQ couplings. Tree-level
LQ amplitudes are exempliﬁed in Fig. 7 for decays that involve charged leptons.

Figure 7: Diagrams of rare meson decays of ﬂavor ( ¯d(cid:48)d)(¯(cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:96)) and (¯u(cid:48)u)(¯(cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:96)) induced by LQs.
The F = 0 LQs contribute as shown in the left-hand side diagram, F = 2 as shown in the
right-hand diagram. Propagators are labelled by charge of the relevant components of the
LQ.

The set of operators with “primes”, X(cid:48) = 7(cid:48), 9(cid:48), 10(cid:48), S(cid:48), P (cid:48), are related to the
“unprimed” set by switching the roles of PL and PR. The standard operator
basis is suited to the SM loop contributions and contains an overall CKM factor
λq, which reads λq = VqjV ∗qi in the case of dj → di(cid:96)−(cid:96)(cid:48)+ processes while for uj →
ui(cid:96)−(cid:96)(cid:48)+ one has λq = V ∗jqViq. The conventions follow the structure of eﬀective
Hamiltonian in rare B decays [126], where the dominant SM contribution is
from the top quark and one puts q = t. For the short-distance contributions
to rare charm decays one usually sets q = b. The basis commonly used in rare
kaon decays diﬀers from the above convention [127, 128]. The prescription for
mapping from the chiral to the standard basis of Wilson coeﬃcients is

(cid:0)cLR ± cLL(cid:1) ,

The result of tree-level matching of a single LQ scenario to the eﬀective
Lagrangian at the scale mLQ is given in the form of Wilson coeﬃcients collected
in Table 4. The running of the Wilson coeﬃcients from high scale mLQ down
to the typical energy scale of a physical process is governed by Eqs. (25) for
coeﬃcients gLL,RR,LR,RL and hLL,RR. At one-loop level the contributions to
7(cid:48) may appear as well, but these
the electromagnetic penguin operators Oij
have negligible eﬀects compared to the Wilson coeﬃcients that appear at the
tree-level (cf. [99]).

(cid:96) /q2 and mqj is the mass of the heavier of the two
where β(cid:96)(q2) =
valence quarks in the pseudoscalar P . The SM contributes only to the C10
coeﬃcient that comes with a helicity suppression factor m2
(cid:96) to the decay width,
which is not present for scalar or pseudoscalar coeﬃcients. Experimental limits
from P → (cid:96)+(cid:96)− are thus mostly sensitive to LQ scenarios that generate C ij;(cid:96)(cid:96)
S((cid:48)) ,
[129]. On the other hand, the lepton ﬂavor violating (LFV) decay modes
C ij;(cid:96)(cid:96)
P ((cid:48))
P → (cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:48) depend further on C (cid:96)(cid:96)
[130] and are numerically more constraining
than the lepton ﬂavor conserving ones. Leptonic decays have been studied
in [131] as well as in Ref. [132], where decay width of Bs → τ τ was related to
the absorptive mixing amplitude in Bs- ¯Bs system. Bounds on LFV decays are
important in situations where a LQ state is interacting with diferent generations
of leptons, cf. Refs. [3, 133, 101, 112].

Decay width expressions for the three body decay P → P (cid:48)(cid:96)+(cid:96)− can be found
for the case of B meson decays in, for example, Refs. [114, 129]. Interplay of
leptonic and semileptonic P → P (cid:48)(cid:96)+(cid:96)− decays together constrain the couplings
of LQ in the b¯s systems very eﬀectively [134, 112, 135, 136, 137, 98]. In the
three-body decay hadronic uncertainties due to local (form factor) and non-
local hadronic contributions are hindering the access to the LQ couplings and
thus decay rates do not present the most stringent and reliable constraints.
These obstacles can be avoided by resorting to LFU ratios, as in e.g. RK ≡
Γ(B → Kµ+µ−)/Γ(B → Ke+e−) [78], where experimental and theoretical
uncertainties are signiﬁcantly reduced. For recent works addressing the RK
observable cf. [138, 96, 90, 99, 120, 119, 77, 97, 91].
Finally, decays with a vector meson P → V (cid:96)+(cid:96)− in the ﬁnal state are ef-
fectively 4-body decays that oﬀer many independent angular observables [139]
and these observables can be used to cross-check scenarios that ﬁt well with the
RK measurements. Result of the global ﬁt of the eﬀective coeﬃcients (47) to
the b → s(cid:96)+(cid:96)− data [140] have recently been interpreted in terms of a vector

LQ model [95, 120]. One of the recent attempts to resolve the problems of the
SM with lepton ﬂavor universality ratios RK and R(∗)
D is by introducing the LQ
state S1. The LQ state S1 modiﬁes lepton universality ratio R(∗)
D at tree level
and the rare decays’ ratio RK only at loop level, thus mimicking the SM loop
suppression pattern of the two observables [91].

Rare charm decays oﬀer less stringent constraints due to large hadronic
uncertainties of the relevant SM contributions. They have been studied in
Refs. [141, 21, 115].
3.2.2. P → V γ and P → Xγ
Rare radiative decays, e.g., B → Xsγ, correspond to penguin diagrams with
a virtual LQ and a lepton and are suppressed by the electromagnetic coupling
and a loop factor α/(4π) ∼ 10−3 at the amplitude level. Most notable decays
are B → K∗γ, B → Xsγ, and D → ργ with well measured branching fractions,
but loop suppressed sensitivity to the LQ couplings. Generally, same couplings
are much better constrained through tree-level contributions of processes with
γ replaced by (cid:96)+(cid:96)− pair. Thus, for the LQ contributions to rare processes
with ﬂavor structure ¯qiqj ¯(cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:48), the electromagnetic penguin insertions ¯qjqiγ are
negligible except in cases when tree-level contributions to ¯qiqj ¯(cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:48) vanish [91].
3.2.3. P → P (cid:48)ν ¯ν, P → V ν ¯ν
Rare decays with neutral quark current and a neutral ¯νν pair in the ﬁnal
state are in close correspondence to decays with the same quark ﬂavors and ¯(cid:96)(cid:48)+(cid:96)−
in the ﬁnal state. Namely, in all LQ models where lepton doublets are involved
both of these processes are relevant and their couplings diﬀer only because of
the PMNS mixing. The relevant eﬀective Lagrangian of LQ contributions to
P → P (cid:48)(V )ν ¯ν introduced in [142] and extended to account for a possibility of
right-handed neutrino involved in LQ interactions reads:

For the B → K ¯νν decays the main contribution is due to the top quark
dominance in the SM and the eﬀective contribution to the “left” Wilson coeﬃ-
cient is cLL,SM
L = −6.35 [142]. The corresponding
SM prediction is Br(B+ → K + ¯νν) = (4.0±0.5)×10−6, while the current exper-
imental upper bound on this decay is 1.6× 10−5 [143]. The eﬀective Lagrangian
of rare decays K → π¯νν, on the other hand, gets SM contributions of box
diagrams with charm/top quark and charged leptons. The charm part of the
eﬀective coeﬃcient is sensitive to the mass of charged lepton and contributes
about 30% of the total branching ratio in K + → π+ ¯νν but has no eﬀect in
KL → π0 ¯νν [144, 145, 146]. The dominant lepton ﬂavor universal part of the
Wilson coeﬃcient, stemming from the top quark penguins and boxes is equal
as in the case of B → K ¯νν, namely C SM
L = −6.35 [146], while the predicted
branching fractions in the SM are Br(K + → π+ ¯νν)SM = (7.8± 0.8)× 10−11 and
Br(KL → π0 ¯νν)SM = (2.4± 0.4)× 10−11. The charged mode has been observed
by the E949 experiment, Br(K + → π+ ¯νν) = (1.7 ± 1.1) × 10−10 [147], whereas
the neutral mode has been bounded from above, Br(KL → π0 ¯νν) < 2.6 × 10−8
at 90%C.L., by the E391a experiment [148].

detailed studies of LQ contributions to B → K (∗)ν ¯ν can be found in Refs. [142,

3.3. Neutral meson anti-meson oscillations

The LQ induced M M mixing amplitudes originate from diagrams with LQ
state with F = 0 or F = 2, accompanied by leptons in the box. For the F = 2
states which always couple to two quarks, additional box diagrams with virtual
quarks are possible. The F = 2 states naïvely seem to mediate meson mixing
at tree level, however the diquark couplings (yij) are always antisymmetric in
ﬂavor space, as shown in Section 1 (also cf. [16]). One can easily see that mixing
amplitudes vanish for antisymmetric diquark Yukawas.

With LQ couplings to lepton and quark ﬁelds as the main focus of this review,
proton decay constraints force the diquark couplings of any F = 2 LQ state to

state has been considered addressing neutral meson mixing constraints see [68].
The interaction Lagrangian of any scalar LQ can be split down to couplings

to left- and right-handed quarks of deﬁnite charge:

L = ¯qi [lijPR + rijPL] (cid:96)j S + h.c.,

(53)
where qi denotes quarks of deﬁnite charge (2/3 or −1/3), (cid:96)j stands for charged
leptons or neutrinos or their charge conjugate (charges −1, 0, 1). Couplings l and
r can be straightforwardly obtained from deﬁning Lagrangians of each scalar LQ
presented in Section 1. The eﬀective Lagrangian in the approximation where
we only keep the LQ mass ﬁnite reads

Speciﬁcation of the vector LQ interactions suited for the study of neutral

meson mixing is completely analogous to Eq. (53):

L = ¯qiγµ [lijPL + rijPR] (cid:96)j Vµ + h.c.,

(55)

with coupling matrices which can be straightforwardly related to LQ couplings
speciﬁed in Section 1. Here Vµ is an eigencharge component of a vector LQ
multiplet. However, the eﬀect of vector LQs in loop processes is model depen-
dent to a large extent. Simple extensions of the SM with a massive vector LQ
with explicit mass term are not renormalizable and are thus dependent on the
details of the UV completion [12]. In particular, the longitudinal component
of the virtual massive vector is not damped suﬃciently in the UV region. In
order to render the setup renormalizable one should formulate a theory with
an extended gauge symmetry where the vector LQ is a gauge boson associated
with part of this symmetry. The gauge symmetry is then broken via the Higgs
mechanism which provides the mass for the vector LQ. The theory in the broken
phase would then be renormalizable. Another consequence in such a setting is
that coupling matrices lij and rij of Eq. (55) must be proportional to some uni-
tary matrices, if we assume that the gauge symmetry is blind to the generation
indices of fermions. The matrices lij and rij are proportional to δij only in the
ﬂavor basis whereas in the mass basis the identity matrix is transformed to a
product of unitary rotations connecting ﬂavor and mass eigenstates.

Some aspects of the spontaneously broken extended gauge symmetry are
independent of the UV details. Indeed, in the unitary gauge the relevant in-
teraction terms reduce to (55) and the vector propagator carries three physical
polarizations, −i(gµν − kµkν/m2
LQ), while all other degrees of free-
dom that depend on the UV completion decouple. In the case of chiral vector
LQs the unitarity of the coupling matrix lij (or rij) is suﬃcient to eliminate all
UV divergences in neutral meson mixing amplitudes. For the vector LQ with

couplings lij the box amplitudes obtained in the unitary gauge match onto the
eﬀective Lagrangian:

Here the double unitarity sum over leptons (cid:96), (cid:96)(cid:48) has been invoked to cancel all
the divergent terms and to impose boundary conditions S0(0, y) = S0(x, 0) = 0.
The part of the amplitude that survives must thus have non-zero and non-
degenerate lepton masses. This GIM-like suppression is completely analogous
to the GIM mechanism in the SM but contrary to the situation in the SM
where large top quark mass typically enhances the amplitudes, here the ﬁnal
V . In the case of non-chiral vector
amplitudes are small due to tiny ratio m2
LQs, lepton helicity ﬂips are allowed in which case the corresponding divergent
parts each come with a lepton mass in front, invalidating the GIM cancellation
of divergences. Bounds on vector LQs in a model independent fashion have
been presented in Ref. [3]. The lifetime diﬀerence in the Bs- ¯Bs system has been
discussed in Refs. [151, 152]. Constraints stemming from the D0- ¯D0 system
properties have been derived in Ref. [153]. An approach to mixing and other
loop mediated amplitudes without the assumption of unitarity of the vector LQ
couplings has been pursued in Ref. [120].

3.4. Rare processes of charged leptons

LQ states contribute to rare charged lepton processes by forming a loop
with quarks and LQs. For the scalar LQs we employ the Lagrangian already
introduced in the subsection on neutral meson mixing, Eq. (53):

L = ¯qi [lijPR + rijPL] ˜(cid:96)j S + h.c..

(58)

Recall that qi is a quark ﬁeld whereas ˜(cid:96)j stands for a charged lepton ˜(cid:96)j = (cid:96)j
(charge-conjugated charged lepton ˜(cid:96)j = ((cid:96)j)C) in the case of scalar S belonging
to a F = 0 (F = 2) LQ multiplet. For the processes with charged leptons it is
convenient to separate the F = 0 and F = 2 cases and rewrite the Lagrangian
(58) for both cases in terms of deﬁnite lepton charge:

LF =0 = ¯qi [lijPR + rijPL] (cid:96)j S + h.c.,

LF =2 = qi,C(cid:2)l∗ijPL + r∗ijPR

(cid:3) (cid:96)j S∗ + h.c..

(59)

Note that the couplings lij and rij are deﬁned as couplings to left- and right-
handed quarks, respectively, irrespective of the value of F .

The above expressions agree with the formulas presented in Ref. [154].
Eqs. (63) the limiting behaviour of the functions is indicated when x becomes
small. Note that in such a limit the contribution of a chiral LQ with charge
QS = 2/3 becomes negligible due to cancellation between the terms with fS
and fF . Eqs. (63) have been derived for the F = 0 case and are easily adapted
to the F = 2 case by ﬂipping the scalar charge, QS → −QS (but with QS is
still deﬁned as charge of ﬁeld S), and applying lq(cid:96) → r∗q(cid:96), rq(cid:96) → l∗q(cid:96).
Rare radiative processes with LFV have been studied for vector and scalar
LQs with unitary coupling matrices in Ref. [155].

3.4.2. Anomalous magnetic moments

Virtual corrections due to LQ states can modify the tree-level electromag-
netic interactions of charged leptons (cid:96). At the level of the (cid:96)(p) → (cid:96)(p(cid:48))γ∗(q, )
amplitude one has [156]:

iσµνqν

u(cid:96)(p)∗µ,

qµ = (p − p(cid:48))µ.

(64)

The gyromagnetic ratio g(cid:96) is then obtained from the relation a(cid:96)(q2 → 0) =
(g(cid:96) − 2)/2. At the eﬀective Lagrangian level a(cid:96) corresponds to the following
interacting Lagrangian:

where Fµν = ∂µAν−∂νAµ. The terms in the brackets are independent of electric
charge convention, while the overall sign reﬂects the choice of the covariant
derivative for lepton: Dµ = ∂µ − ieAµ. From the amplitude (60) adapted to the
(cid:96) = (cid:96)(cid:48) case one can extract a(cid:96) = im(cid:96)(σL + σR). All F = 0 scalar LQs contribute

LQ

The above expression is valid for LQ with F = 0 and can be recast to the
F = 2 case by changing the sign before QS. Eq. (66) reveals that a chiral
LQ charge-eigenstate contributes to a(cid:96) with a deﬁnite sign depending only on
QS. However, complete LQ multiplets could have contributions from diﬀerent
QS and in such cases the sign may depend on the interplay between Yukawa
couplings of diﬀerently charged states. We do not consider contributions of
vector LQ states towards a(cid:96) since their contributions largely depend on the UV
details of the theory.

Currently the most precise experimental result on the magnetic moment
of the muon is due to the E821 experiment performed at BNL [157, 158] and
µ = 1.16592080(63) × 10−3. Comparing it to the contemporary
amounts to aexp
µ = 1.16591803(70)×10−3 [14] the diﬀerence
state-of-the-art SM predictions, aSM
µ = (2.8±0.9)×10−9, entails a strong
between the two numbers, ∆aµ ≡ aexp
µ −aSM
constraint on the couplings of LQ states to muon. Next generation experiments
will reduce the error in aexp

by a factor of 4 [159].

The contributions of LQs to a(cid:96) have been presented in Ref. [160, 161, 162,
163, 94]. The connection between aµ and the electric dipole of the muon, in
light of the BNL measurement, has been advocated in [162]. The interplay
between LFV lepton decays have been studied in Ref. [164, 111]. Bounds on
the LQ couplings, albeit weak, have been also derived from the measurements
of neutrino magnetic moments in Ref. [165].

3.4.3. (cid:96) → (cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:48)
The four-lepton lepton ﬂavor violating amplitude is mediated by box dia-
grams via virtual quarks and LQs and correspond to diagrams of neutral meson
LQ, where y
mixing via LQ turned inside out. Their amplitudes scale as ∼ y4/m2
is the relevant LQ coupling. Formulas for the neutral meson mixing amplitudes,
i.e., (54) and (56), can be straightforwardly adapted to cover the (cid:96) → (cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:48) pro-
cesses. However, tree-level constraints, e.g. LFV decays P → (cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:48) and penguin
mediated radiative amplitudes enabling radiative LFV processes (cid:96) → (cid:96)(cid:48)γ or µ-e
conversion on nuclei, generically oﬀer better probes of the same LQ couplings.

3.4.4. µ-e conversion in nuclei

Competitive lepton ﬂavor violation constraints on LQ interactions can be
obtained from searches for µ-e conversion in nuclei. Currently the strongest
bounds on BRµe ≡ Γconversion/Γcapture were set by the SINDRUM collaboration
from experiments on titanium with BR(Ti)
µe < 4.3 × 10−12 [166] and gold target
setting BR(Au)
µe < 7 × 10−13 [167], both at 90%C.L. The µ-e conversion bounds
are expected to be further improved in the future by several orders of magnitude.
According to proposals [168] and [169, 170], one can expect a sensitivity of 10−16
or even 10−18 by the PRISM/PRIME experiment.

To get the constraint in the µ-e channel from these experiments, one needs to
compute the relevant transition matrix elements in diﬀerent nuclei. A detailed
numerical calculation has been carried out in Ref. [171] and we use their Eq. (14)

Since both Ti and Au processes feature the same ﬂavor structure, the dif-
ferences between them are entirely determined by the numerical factors quoted

factor ∼ 2.5 smaller than the ones for Au, whereas the capture rates diﬀer by a
factor ∼ 5. Accordingly the diﬀerence between these branching ratios is a factor
of ∼ 2. Since the current experimental Au bound is a factor of six stronger, the

These decays are uniquely sensitive to Yukawas with light quarks and the
tau lepton. Limits on their branching fractions have been set by the B factories
and are expected to be further extended in the near future by the upcoming
Belle-II experiment. As an example, consider the width of the pionic channel

3.5. Electric dipole moments

LQs might contribute to the electric dipole moments (EDMs) of quarks and
leptons even at the one loop level as pointed out in Ref. [173]. The scenario is
possible if there are two diﬀerent couplings of a LQ to a quark and a lepton.
Namely, a LQ coupling to both left- and right-handed quarks can produce an
EDM of a lepton at the one loop level due to a chirality ﬂip on the internal
quark line. Of course, such a scenario can only be eﬃcient for heavy quarks (in
particular the top) in the loop. For the same reason one loop LQ contributions
to quark EDMs, with leptons running in the loop are severely suppressed and
generically ignored.

Although the preceding discussion is applicable to all lepton generations, in
light of rather weak bounds on the muon and tau EDMs in the following we
focus on the electron EDM. As noticed by the authors of Ref. [173] in the case
of R2 ≡ (3, 2, 7/6) scalar LQ the EDM of the electron is found to be

couplings

Among all other LQs we ﬁnd that only the S1 ≡ (¯3, 1, 1/3) scalar has two
diﬀerent couplings leading to

4. Top quark, Electroweak precision and Higgs physics constraints

Measurements involving top quarks, electroweak gauge bosons and the Higgs
boson typically proceed at much larger energy scales than precision ﬂavor and
CP violation probes. Nonetheless, existing direct constraints on LQ masses
(See Section 5) typically justify the use of eﬀective ﬁeld theory methods in this
regime, i.e., the relevant expansion (v/mLQ)n is expected to be convergent and
well approximated by the ﬁrst non-vanishing terms.

A special role is played by the electroweak precision observables which are
uniquely sensitive to possible mass splittings within SU (2) LQ multiplets. In

47

particular, the stringently constrained oblique corrections are discussed in Sec-
tion 4.2.2.

Finally, special attention needs to be paid to the role of scalar LQs in Higgs
physics. In particular, these states can generically couple to the Higgs boson
through the scalar potential which contains gauge invariant marginal operator of
the form S†SH†H, where S is the LQ ﬁeld and H is the SM Higgs doublet. The
so-called “Higgs portal” operator, after electroweak symmetry breaking, induces
corrections to the masses of weak S components (Si) as well as the couplings to
the physical Higgs boson (S†i Sih), which in turn can aﬀect loop induced Higgs
production and decay processes. Such eﬀects can be probed with the Higgs
signal strength measurements at hadron and lepton colliders. In Section 4.3 we
review the impact of scalar LQs on Higgs boson phenomenology. We show how
the currently available LHC Higgs data constrain the relevant parameter space
and discuss possible improvements with future-projected data.

4.1. Leptoquarks in processes of top quarks

LQs coupling to the third generation can leave observable imprints in pro-
cesses involving top quarks. Most of the general considerations presented in
the opening paragraphs of Section 3 apply here as well. At the tree level, LQs
(assumed heavier than the top quark) can contribute to eﬀective four-fermion
interactions in Eq. (46) where the relevant LQ contributions can be read from
Table 4. Their implications for top quark phenomenology have been studied
recently [174]. As reviewed in Section 3 most stringent existing constraints on
such LQ couplings can actually be derived from low energy phenomenology. In
particular LFV rare meson and charged lepton decays receive relevant contri-
butions from LQ top-quark interactions at the one-loop or even two-loop level.
In top quark phenomenology, indirect LQ eﬀects can be probed using both
top quark decays and production. In particular, tree-level LQ contributions can
induce LFV three-body decays of top quarks, which can be searched for using
the large top quark datasets at high energy hadron (or future lepton) colliders.
Alternatively, indirect eﬀects of LQ’s coupling simultaneously to top quarks,
electrons and light quarks can be searched for in e p colliders (see also Sec-
tion 5.4). We review both directions in the following subsections. On the other
hand, LQ contributions to radiative top quark decays and single top quark pro-
duction at hadron colliders are necessarily loop suppressed and thus oﬀer limited
sensitivity to the relevant LQ couplings. Especially since they have to compete
against sizable CKM allowed SM contributions to the two-body dominated top
quark decay width and hadronic single top production, respectively.

4.1.1. LFV top quark decays

The HERA electron-proton collider at DESY collided protons with positrons
(or electrons) at a centre of mass energy of 319 GeV, had also searched for sin-

few events with energetic isolated leptons and missing energy, consistent with
e±p → te± + X followed by a leptonic decay of the top quark [176, 177]. How-
ever, this signal was not conﬁrmed by the ZEUS experiment [178], and neither
collaboration had a signal consistent with hadronic top decays. Both collabora-
tions thus set bounds on σ(e±p → e±tX). In particular H1 obtained a somewhat
weaker bound due to their observed excess

σ(e±p → e±t + X) < 0.3 pb @95%C.L. .

4.2.1. Atomic parity violation

Stringent constraints on LQ couplings to the ﬁrst generation fermions can
be derived from atomic parity violation (APV) measurements in 133Cs (see for
example [179]). The relevant LQ contribution occurs at the tree level and can
be parameterized as

¯eγµγ5e (δC1u ¯uγµu + δC1d ¯dγµd) ,

(77)

(cid:88)

q=u,d

LP V =

where the eﬀective δC1u and δC1d coeﬃcients receive the matching contribution
from a scalar LQ propagation. For example,

δC1u(d) =

.

(78)

where yde and yue are the corresponding (cid:96)−LQ−q couplings (L ⊃ −yqe ¯qPR(L)e S),
and mLQ is the LQ mass. A generic LQ contribution can easily be obtained by
comparing the eﬀective lagrangian in Eq. (77) to the one in Eq. (46),

δC1q = cLL

qq;ee − cLR

qq;ee + cRL

qq;ee − cRR

qq;ee ,

(79)

and using the results of the matching calculations reported in Table 4. The
eﬀective δC1u and δC1d coeﬃcients modify the nuclear weak charge as [180]

δQW (Z, N ) = −2(2Z + N )δC1u − 2(Z + 2N )δC1d ,

where the measured value deviates from the SM expectation by 1.5 σ [181]

The bounds presented in Eq. (83) are extracted under the assumption that only
one of the two contributions is present at a given moment. Note, however, that
it is not possible to cancel δC1u against δC1d or vice versa. This means that the
upper bounds presented in Eq. (83) are applicable in the most general case.

4.2.2. Oblique corrections

The eﬀects of a new heavy particles, which contribute to W and Z boson
self-energies at one-loop level, can be constrained from oblique electroweak pa-
rameters S and T [182]. A recent global ﬁt of the electroweak precision data [183]
reports

S = 0.05 ± 0.11 , T = 0.09 ± 0.13 ,

(84)
with the correlation coeﬃcient of +0.90. Scalar LQ representation, with a mass
splitting in the multiplet, can induce large corrections to these parameters.
For example, the contribution of a scalar LQ doublet representation to oblique
parameters is [184, 185]

(86)

In other words, the dominant constrains on the heavy LQ doublet is due to the
T parameter which depends on the mass splitting (∆m) and does not depend
on the LQ mass (m1). Using the experimental data reported above, we ﬁnd a
robust limit on the mass splitting

|∆m| < 53 GeV at 95%C.L. .

(87)
Consider an operator of the form, L ⊃ −λS(S†H)(H†S), where S is the LQ dou-
blet representation and SU (2) contraction singlets are separated with brackets.
After electroweak symmetry breaking, the operator induces mass splitting in
the doublet, in particular, ∆m = −λSv2/(4m1) where v is the electroweak con-
densate. If no other source of mass splitting is present, the bound from Eq. (87)
translates into a bound on the above “Higgs portal” operator (λS).

4.2.3. Non-oblique corrections: Z → b¯b
LQ induced eﬀects in precision electroweak measurements can also show up
as vertex corrections to V ¯f f interactions, where V is an electroweak gauge
boson while f is a SM fermion. To illustrate the eﬀect, we consider the impact

51

of the scalar LQ representation R2 ≡ (3, 2, 7/6) on Z¯bb eﬀective coupling. We
adopt the following parameterization of the eﬀective interaction,

the couplings are gb0
W /3. Going beyond tree-level,
the higher-order electroweak corrections get the largest contribution from top

it directly. The LQ correction to the left-handed coupling is

On the other hand, the LEP experiment measured precisely the decay modes
of Z bosons to f ¯f pairs. A recent global ﬁt to electroweak data [186], ﬁnds the
coupling shifts to be

with the correlation coeﬃcient ρ = 0.82 [186]. A slight tension with respect to
the SM prediction (above 2 σ signiﬁcance) is observed. Although δgb
L develops
an imaginary part due to on-shell τ leptons, the constraint from the electroweak
ﬁt in Eq. (90) is sensitive to the interference term between the approximately
real gb
L(y33)
enters the prediction. This implies a very weak constraint on the LQ coupling,
for example, mR2 = 500 GeV gives |y33| (cid:46) 10.
Along these lines, authors in Ref. [187] perform a global ﬁt to LEP data
including oblique and vertex corrections induced by LQs. Also, Refs. [188, 189]
report bounds on LQ interactions from LEP-II e+e− → f ¯f cross section and
distribution measurements. The constraints on LQs from Z decays have also
been considered in Ref. [101].

4.3. Leptoquarks and Higgs physics

Scalar LQs with masses around electroweak scale and tree level couplings to
the Higgs boson (S†i Sih), can signiﬁcantly modify the Higgs boson production
and decay processes that are induced at one-loop level in the SM. Examples of
such are the dominant single and double Higgs boson production mechanisms,
gg → h and gg → hh, as well as experimentally interesting Higgs decays, h → γγ
and h → Zγ. In these processes, loop diagrams with suﬃciently light LQs can
easily compete with the SM contributions and lead to O(1) eﬀect in physical
observables such as the total cross sections and partial decay widths.
Assuming the diﬀerent weak components (Si) to be degenerate, as expected
from the electroweak precision constraints, the contribution of a single colored
scalar representation (S) to loop induced processes can be parametrized in terms
of the relevant coupling and mass. The Higgs portal interaction is

L (cid:51) −λS(S†iaSia)(H†j Hj) = −λSv S†iaSiah + . . . ,

(91)

where the sum over weak (i, j) and color (a) indices is shown explicitly. In other
words, the eﬀects of such interactions are described in terms of two parameters
only; the coupling constant λS and the common mass of the weak components
mLQ. Also, the electroweak condensate is v = 246.22 GeV.

4.3.1. Loop-induced Higgs processes

Single LQ representation S interacting with the Higgs through Eq. (91),

modiﬁes the partial decay width for h → γγ as [190, 191, 192, 193]

The ﬁrst two terms in Eq. (92) are the SM contribution from the W boson
loop interfering destructively with the subdominant top quark loop. The nu-
merical values of the relevant SM loop functions evaluated for mh = 125 GeV,

53

are A1(xW ) = −8.3, A1/2(xt) = 1.4. On the other hand, the new physics loop
function in the limit of heavy LQ is A0(xs → 0) → 1/3. This limit is a good
approximation for the interesting LQ mass range, for instance, mLQ = 200 GeV
implies A0(xs) = 0.35. To sum up, the modiﬁed h → γγ partial decay width
normalized to the SM prediction is given by

duction receives large corrections from higher order QCD eﬀects [194], however,
the ratio in Eq. (100) is found to be less sensitive [195].

disentangling among diﬀerent representation hypotheses.

4.3.2. The Higgs ﬁt

The combination of Higgs coupling measurements performed by ATLAS and
CMS experiments is reported in [196, 197]. Among other analyses, the collab-
orations perform a ﬁt assuming that there is no large modiﬁcation of the tree
level Higgs couplings and that the new physics gives a non-standard contribu-
tion to the loop-induced hgg and hγγ couplings. The collaborations report the
(cid:113)

with the Gaussian form we ﬁnd

κγ = 1.045 ± 0.090 , κg = 1.017 ± 0.094 ,

(102)

with the correlation coeﬃcient ρ = −0.35.
Referring to the discussion from the previous section, the dominant impact
of LQs on Higgs data is expected to be the modiﬁcation of the loop-induced
Higgs couplings. Thus, the results of the ﬁt reported above can be used to
constrain the size of LQ interactions to the Higgs boson via the Higgs portal
operator. In Table 7 we show the preferred range for λS(v/mLQ)2 for all scalar
LQ representations.

Furthermore, a single LQ representation induces a correlation among κγ and
κg parameters. The correlation curves in (κγ, κg) plane are shown in Fig. 10 for
several LQ representations. The constraints from the LHC reported in Eq. (102),
are shown in green and yellow for 68% and 95% C.L.s regions.

Let us summarize the results of the ﬁt. In particular, the decoupling limit
to the SM (λS → 0 and (or) mLQ → ∞) is compatible with the current Higgs
data. Assuming λS ∼ 1, masses around electroweak condensate scale are being
probed. The constraints are mainly driven by the measurements of the gluon-
gluon fusion production. The approximate relation derived from Eq. (100),

Higgs decay to Z and γ is generated at one-loop level in the SM. Being ex-

ments are |κZγ| < 3.3 and |κZγ| < 3.1 at 95% C.L., respectively. However,
once it is measured, it will constitute a complementary probe of new physics

4.3.4. Flavor violating Higgs boson decays

Flavor violating (FV) Higgs interactions are negligible in the SM. Finding
these at LHC would be an indisputable evidence of the physics beyond the
SM. Particular attention is given to t → hq, with q = u, c and h → τ (cid:96), with
(cid:96) = e, µ. The reason is that the signal rates expected from new physics can
easily be within the reach of LHC and yet in agreement with the low energy
data [203, 204, 205].

B(h → τ µ) =(cid:0)0.84+0.39

Interestingly enough, the CMS collaboration has recently reported 2.4 σ ex-
cess in the search for h → τ µ [206]. The best ﬁt for the branching ratio of
h → τ µ (more precisely, h → τ−µ+ + τ +µ−), assuming SM Higgs production,
is found to be
(107)
A scalar LQ can, in principle, induce h → τ µ decay via quark-LQ penguin
diagrams [202, 207]. The helicity ﬂip is required on one of the fermion lines in
these diagrams, thus, only LQs that couple to top quark and charged leptons
are suitable candidates to accommodate the excess. Furthermore, both left and
right chiralities of leptons and top quark are required to couple to the LQ. The
relevant diagrams are shown in Fig. 11. These involve the contribution from the
top-LQ coupling, as well as, the “Higgs portal” operator (see Eq. (91)).

Let us discuss the impact of the particular LQ representation; S1 = (3, 1, 1/3).

with current direct search limits at the LHC [208, 209] and the Higgs portal
coupling is turned oﬀ. The CMS measurement is shown in the same plot.

Conclusively, to ﬁt the CMS excess, the relevant LQ couplings are required to
be O(1). On the other hand, the same state also contributes to the τ → µγ with
the same coupling combinations present in h → τ µ. Referring to Section 3.4.1

Shown in Fig. 12 (right) is B(τ → µγ) as a function of LQ-fermion couplings
again for mS1 = 650 GeV. The parameter space colored in grey is excluded
by experiment. To sum up, a single LQ representation can not simultaneously
explain the CMS h → τ µ excess while still remaining in agreement with low-
energy data from LFV τ decays. (For a possibility to address the h → τ∓µ±
excess with two LQs — S1 and R2 — while avoiding the τ → µγ constraint
through cancellation of relevant contributions see Ref. [210].)
It is illustrative to study the impact of a non-zero Higgs portal coupling in
the model with S1 LQ representation. Again we take mS1 = 650 GeV for the
numerical benchmark. The loop function dependence on the portal coupling in
the numerical form is given by

g1(λ, mS1 = 650 GeV) = −(0.26 + 0.12λ) .

In principle, a positive large λ could reduce the required size of the the LQ-
fermion couplings and yield sizable h → τ µ rates while keeping τ → µγ under
control. This, however, turns out to be disfavoured by the Higgs data. As
discussed before, the Higgs portal coupling is constrained from the global ﬁt
to Higgs data mainly due to its contributions to h → γγ and to gluon-gluon
fusion Higgs production. We can directly use the limit derived in the Table 7
which translates into g1(λ, mS1) = 0.6 ± 0.9. This, in turn, is not enough to
the observed level.

Let us conclude this section with an explicit example of a phenomenological
viable model in which τ → µγ is ﬁne-tuned to zero, while accommodating the
h → τ µ excess. Following Ref. [202], extra scalar LQ S1 = (3, 1, 1/3) and a
vector-like top quark partner T (cid:48)L, T (cid:48)R = (3, 1, 2/3) are added to the SM. The
top partner mixes with the SM top quark. After rotating to the mass basis,
τ → µγ decay amplitude will receive two competing contributions from both, t
and T , at one loop level. This scenario requires large amount of ﬁne-tuning in
τ → µγ, while keeping h → τ µ at the observed level.
4.4. Diphoton decays of heavy scalars in presence of leptoquarks

After analyzing the ﬁrst data sets from 13 TeV proton proton collisions at
the LHC, both ATLAS and CMS collaborations have reported a tantalizing
excess in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum around ∼ 750 GeV. The CMS
collaboration, on one hand, reported a 95% C.L. upper limit of 13.7 fb on σ × B
for a resonance decaying into two photons, with an expected exclusion of 6.3 fb
(Fig. 6 of Ref. [211]), which corresponds to an excess with a local signiﬁcance of
2.6 σ [211]. On the other hand, the ATLAS collaboration reported the observed
exclusion limit for a narrow-width scalar resonance µATLAS
13 TeV < 11.5 fb, compared
with an expected exclusion of 2.6 fb (Fig. 3 of Ref. [212]), exhibiting an excess
of 3.6 σ local signiﬁcance [212].

When interpreting the excess as a scalar (or pseudoscalar) resonance, pro-
duced dominantly via gluon-gluon fusion, no signiﬁcant tension with 8 TeV anal-

Following analogous discussions for the Higgs boson, the relevant eﬀective in-
teractions can be generated at one loop level by new heavy colored and charged
particles with the renormalizable couplings to the resonance. Vector LQs that
appear in the solutions of B physics anomalies have been advocated to provide
enough contribution to ﬁt the signal in Ref. [215]. Scalar LQs, on the other
hand, have been suggested for the similar purpose in Refs. [216, 217, 218, 219].
The self-consistency analysis of two particular scalar LQ scenarios has been
subsequently presented in Ref. [220]. The scenarios under scrutiny comprise a
model with a single LQ [216] and a model with two LQs [217].

5. Collider Searches

The most direct way to probe for LQs is to produce them at colliders and to
investigate their subsequent decay patterns, i.e., decay channels and associated
branching fractions. LQs have accordingly been searched for and studied in
the context of e+ e−, e p, p ¯p and p p colliders. We opt to present these studies
in this particular order concentrating especially on the LHC case.
(The e γ
collider signatures will also be discussed for completeness.) However, before
we turn our attention towards issues that depend on intricacies of particular
production mechanisms we address the question of LQ decay that is common
for all colliders.

5.1. Leptoquark decays

Once produced LQs should decay. The most general expression for the width
ΓS of the two-body decay of a scalar LQ S of mass mLQ into a quark q of mass
mq and a lepton l of mass ml is

where y denotes Yukawa coupling of LQ to a given quark-lepton pair. (Our

(118)

Total decay width is simply the sum of all partial widths. The decay length is
thus inversely proportional to both the sum of squares of relevant couplings and
the LQ mass. This usually results in the following implicit assumption when
it comes to LQ decays at colliders. Namely, the coupling(s) y are taken to be
suﬃciently large to insure prompt decay of a given LQ in the detector. One can
estimate that this puts a lower bound of about |y| ≥ 10−7 for mLQ = 500 GeV.
This, again, is an underlying assumption of all LQ searches to date.
One also expects Yukawa couplings to be bounded from above purely on
theoretical grounds. Namely, a requirement that a self-consistent theory be
perturbative places an upper bound on Yukawa (gauge) couplings that is of
the order of 4π (√4π). The perturbativity bound is clearly not very stringent,
especially when compared with existing bounds from ﬂavor physics, and we do
not refer to it in the rest of the discussion.

(cid:1) /(16π) = Γ(R5/3

Let us now mention one model building issue that is related to LQ decay.
This concerns all those LQs that couple to a quark multiplet and/or a lepton
multiplet that transforms non-trivially under SU (2) factor of the SM gauge
group. Let us assume, for example, that LQ R2 has only one Yukawa coupling
diﬀerent from zero. (Recall, R2 is an SU (2) doublet. It thus needs to couple to
another doublet to yield a gauge singlet. See, for example, Eqs. (3) and (4).) Let
that coupling be x11 = y, i.e., xij = δ1iδ1jy, in order to have R5/3
to be purely
of the ﬁrst generation kind. This then means that the decay width of R5/3
(cid:80)
LQ is Γ(R5/3
) = (|y|2mLQ)/(16π), whereas the other charged component, i.e.,
R2/3
). We see that
i |VPMNS|2
this simple ansatz predicts, through unitarity of PMNS matrix, equal decay
2 → eu and R2/3
widths for both R5/3
2 → νu channels, where u is an up quark.
It is often assumed that LQ under investigation has two distinct decay chan-
nels. One possible signature corresponds to the LQ decay into a charged lepton
of particular ﬂavor (l) and a jet (j) and the other signature is due to the LQ
decay into a neutrino (ν) and a jet. It is furthermore customary to denote cor-
responding branching ratios as β and (1 − β), respectively. This assumption
needs to be handled with care. For example, S1/3
can simultaneously couple
to lj and νj pairs.
(See Eq. (2).) However, these two sets of couplings are
related via CKM and PMNS mixing matrices. In other words, β is ﬁxed for a
given ansatz for Yukawa couplings. The same is true for S1, U 2/3
, and U1 LQs.
Experimental observation of these particular decays might thus allow for ﬂavor
goniometry at low energies in similar manner to what was initially proposed for
B and L violating LQs in proton decay experiments [36].

Note that it is entirely possible to have LQs produced in ultrahigh-energy
neutrino interactions. These LQs could then be accessible to neutrino telescopes.
This idea has been investigated in several works [221, 222, 223, 224, 225]. For
example, an analysis of the possibility to probe parameter space of second and
third generation LQs at the IceCube experiment [74] has been put forth in
Ref. [225]. We will not comment further on this possibility but turn to discuss
topics that are related to the collider speciﬁc physics instead.

5.2. e γ collider signatures

Production of LQs has been discussed within the context of e γ machines [226,
227, 228, 229, 230]. For example, the possiblility to have single production of
vector LQs through the process γ e− → LQ q was investigated in Ref. [227] for
the case of LQ of electric charge |Q| = 2/3. This LQ needs to couple to an elec-
tron in order to be produced and accordingly couples to the down-type quarks
d, s, and b.

The possibility for the detection of scalar LQs at e γ colliders through the
single production mechanism has been presented in Ref. [228]. The authors of
Ref. [228] have shown that the detection of real LQs would be possible even
for the case when the LQ masses are as high as the centre-of-mass energy of
the collider and Yukawa couplings are as small as 10−5. This has been done
considering two particular values — √s = 500 GeV and √s = 1 TeV — for the
centre-of-mass energy. For relevant diﬀerential cross-section for the real scalar
LQ production as a function of the LQ electric charge see Eq. (2) of Ref. [228].
We reproduce in Fig. 13 diagrams for single LQ production at e γ machine
considered in Ref. [228], where the ﬁnal state is q (¯q) for the LQ with F = 0
(F = −2).
5.3. e+ e− collider signatures

Production of scalar and vector LQs through e+ e− annihilation has a long
history [231, 232, 226, 233, 234, 235, 227, 17]. Relevant diagrams for a pair
production of scalar LQs are shown in the top row of Fig. 14. The pair pro-
duction is driven by the LQ couplings to electroweak gauge bosons (γ and Z)
as well as Yukawa couplings of LQ to matter. The underlying assumption that
a LQ couples to an electron is a necessity for the latter production scenario.
Note that the term “electron” is used generically to refer to both electrons and
positrons, if not otherwise stated.

To obtain Feynman diagrams relevant for a pair production of vector LQs
through e+ e− annihilation one needs to replace scalar LQs with vector LQs and
Yukawa couplings with gauge couplings in Fig. 14.

The most general expressions for the pair production cross sections and dif-
ferential distributions for both scalar and vector LQs can be found in Ref. [17]
under the assumption that the LQ couplings are family diagonal.
(See also
Refs. [233, 234].) The contribution that corresponds to photon exchange was

tion is on the production of quark-antiquark pairs. This eﬀect has been studied
in Ref. [237]. LQs can also be produced singly at e+ e− colliders. For a study
that investigates this particular possibility see, for example, Ref. [238].

5.3.1. Searches at e+ e− colliders

First experimental results on the LQ production at e+ e− colliders have
been generated at the storage ring PETRA with CELLO [239] and JADE [240]
detectors. For example, the CELLO Collaboration performed a search for light
LQs decaying into either a muon or a neutrino and a quark. The lack of evidence
for pair production of LQs allowed the CELLO Collaboration to exclude the
LQ masses between 7 GeV and 20.5 GeV [239]. These results have been followed
with the searches for LQs in e+ e− annihilations at TRISTAN [241] using the
AMY detector. The center-of-mass energies that were used to collect data at
TRISTAN varied from 50 GeV to 60.8 GeV. These should be compared with the
center-of-mass energies at PETRA that were around 35 GeV.

LQs have been subsequently searched for at the LEP e+ e− collider by the
ALEPH [242], DELPHI [243, 244, 245], L3 [246, 247], and OPAL [248, 249]
Collaborations.

The LEP limits on the LQ parameter space were primarily generated by
considered LQ pair production. For example, a search performed by OPAL de-
tector for pair-produced LQs at centre-of-mass energies between 189 GeV and
209 GeV and with the total integrated luminosity of 596 pb−1, yields a robust
limits on scalar and vector LQs with mLQ (cid:38) 100 GeV, depending on the speciﬁc
LQ representation. (For details see Table 12 of Ref. [250].) DELPHI, however,
did considered single LQ production. The representative diagram for this pro-
cess is shown in the bottom row of Fig. 14. For example, the DELPHI detector
was used to look for events with one jet and at most one isolated lepton using
the LEP-2 data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 47.7 pb−1. The
data were collected at a center-of-mass energy of 183 GeV. The analysis pro-
duced the set of upper limits on Yukawa couplings of scalar and vector LQs
as a function of mLQ. These were presented in Fig. 4 of Ref. [245]. Also, the
lower limits were placed on the mass of a ﬁrst generation LQs for a coupling pa-
rameter y = √4παem assuming branching ratios to charged leptons and quarks
to be 1 and 0.5. These limits are presented in Table 2 of Ref. [245]. The
most stringent limit on mLQ of scalar (vector) LQ at 95% conﬁdence level was
161 GeV (171 GeV) for |Q| = 1/3, 5/3 and β = 1, where Q is electric charge and
β branching ratio.

5.4. e p collider signatures

LQs in lepton-quark collisions have been studied extensively in the past. See,
for example, Refs. [49, 9, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257]. Feynman diagrams
that are relevant for the search for scalar LQs at e p colliders at the leading
order are shown in Fig. 15. Scalar LQ can be produced through an s-channel
process that is shown in the left panel of Fig. 15. It can also be exchanged in a

diagrams in Fig. 15 correspond to the LQ models involving either ˜R2 or R2. To
switch to the diagrams relevant for the (3B + L) = −2 LQs it is suﬃcient to
make the following exchange: qi ↔ ¯qi.
Contact interactions of the form eeqq within the context of e p collider that
are due to the LQ exchange have been studied in Ref. [258].

5.4.1. Searches at e p collider

There are numerous searches for the LQs at the HERA e p collider that
were conducted by the H1 [259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267] and
ZEUS [268, 269, 270] Collaborations. Clearly, a LQ needs to couple to an
electron to be produced in the ﬁrst place. However, the LQ decay and/or the
LQ exchange can result, in principle, in leptons of all ﬂavors as indicated in
Fig. 15. Here we summarise existing searches that are based on e+ p and e− p
scattering data at HERA.

The limits on the parameter space of ﬁrst generation scalar and vector LQs
were presented in Ref. [265]. The search was performed using the e+ p and e− p
data corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 117 pb−1. The data were
collected by the H1 experiment at HERA between 1994 and 2000. The study
looked for a signal of direct or indirect LQ production in data samples with a
large transverse momentum ﬁnal state electron or with large missing transverse
momentum. Due to the lack of signal LQs with masses of up to 275–325 GeV
were ruled out assuming LQ couplings to matter of electromagnetic strength,
i.e., y = 0.3(≈ √4παem).
The H1 experiment did not only look for ﬁrst generation LQs but also for
events with a high transverse momentum µ or τ to cover the mixed fermion
generation scenario [263]. The analysis in question used data collected from
1994 to 1997 that amounted to an integrated luminosity of 37 pb−1. Scalar
LQs were excluded for masses up to 275 GeV for a coupling of electromagnetic
strength. The study also excluded any LQ type up to 400 GeV for couplings
of order one. Constraints were also set on the product of Yukawa coupling
involving µ or τ with Yukawa coupling involving the electron as a function

66

qeLQkqiyk1yij*ljyjklqLQyi1jk*eqiof the LQ mass [263]. Final results were presented in the form of tabulated
constraints — upper limits — on (yi1yjk)/m2
LQ, where k = 2, 3 and i, j = 1, 2
for real couplings. (See Fig. 15 for notation.)

Another analysis of production of second and third generation LQs was also
performed by the H1 Collaboration [266]. This study excluded existence of
LQs produced in e+ p and e− p collisions with a coupling strength of y = 0.3
to an electron-quark pair and decaying with the same coupling strength to a
muon-quark or a tau-quark pair at 95% conﬁdence level up to LQ masses of
712 GeV and 479 GeV, respectively. See Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Ref. [266]
LQ was
for comprehensive list of all results. For example, the ratio (y11y22)/m2
constrained to be below 0.7 in units of TeV−2 at 95% C.L. for LQ SL
1/2. All other
bounds on (yi1yjk)/m2
LQ were of the same order of magnitude. Here, k = 2, 3
and i, j = 1, 2.

A search for resonances that could decay into ej and νj was performed with
the ZEUS detector at HERA operating at center-of-mass energies of 300 GeV
and 318 GeV [269]. The analysis that was based on an integrated e+ p (e− p)
luminosity of 114.8 pb−1 (16.7 pb−1) found no evidence for such a resonance.
For example, the study excluded LQs with masses of up to 290 GeV for Yukawa
coupling of 0.1 [269]. (For the search for LQs with the ZEUS detector that was
based on 26 nb−1 of integrated luminosity see analysis presented in Ref. [268].)
The most stringent constraints on parameter space of ﬁrst generation LQs
in e p collisions at HERA came from the study of full H1 data sample [267].
An integrated luminosity of 446 pb−1 was used to exclude ﬁrst generation LQs
with masses up to 800 GeV at 95% conﬁdence level for LQ couplings of electro-
magnetic strength. The ZEUS detector, on the other hand, performed a search
for ﬁrst generation LQs using a total of 498 pb−1 of data to set limits on the
LQ Yukawa coupling as a function of its mass. The data in question originated
from the 1994–2000 and 2003–2007 collection periods. LQs with a coupling of
electromagnetic strength were excluded for masses up to 699 GeV [270].

Before we conclude discussion of experimental searches at e p colliders it is
worth mentioning that both H1 Collaboration [271] and ZEUS [272] reported in
1997 an anomalous measurement while studying e p scattering at high values of
squared four-momentum transfer denoted Q2. For example, the ZEUS detector
at HERA observed two events for Q2 > 35000 GeV2 while 0.145 ± 0.013 events
were expected. The sample under consideration was based on the reaction
e+ p → e+ X with a 20.1 pb−1 of data collected during the years 1994 through
1996. For Q2 below 15000 GeV2 the observed signal at ZEUS detector was
in good agreement with the SM expectations. This anomaly has accordingly
attracted a lot of attention with one of potential physical explanations being
that of an s-channel LQ production. See, for example, Refs. [273, 274, 275,
276, 277, 237, 278, 4, 279, 255, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289,
290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 184, 295, 296, 54, 297] for studies directly related to
aforementioned anomaly.

production mechanism. Here, yij, i, j = 1, 2, 3, represents appropriate Yukawa coupling of a
quark (qi) and a lepton (lj) with a LQ.

5.5. p ¯p and p p collider signatures

LQs are colored ﬁelds. They could thus be copiously produced at hadron
machines. Moreover, the fact that they decay into (charged) leptons makes
the detection of their signatures feasible. We start by discussing production
mechanisms at leading order. We will focus on scalar LQs in what follows.

Feynman diagrams that depict the LQ pair production at hadron colliders at
the leading order are shown in Fig. 16. The QCD diagrams that contribute to a
LQ pair production are numerous. We opt to show one representative diagram
for gluon-gluon fusion and one diagram that corresponds to a quark-antiquark
annihilation process in the upper left and right panels of Fig. 16, respectively.
There is, on the other hand, only one type of the Yukawa coupling contribution
to the LQ pair production and it corresponds to a t-channel process shown in
the lower panel of Fig. 16. The amplitude that corresponds to a t-channel is
proportional to a product of two relevant Yukawa couplings. This makes it
especially relevant in the limit of large Yukawas.

If we assume that the LQ pair production is purely QCD driven and com-
pletely neglect t-channel contribution there are only two distinct partonic level
processes that should be taken into consideration. The ﬁrst corresponds to the
gluon-gluon fusion (g g → LQ LQ) and the second process is due to the quark-
antiquark annihilation (q ¯q → LQ LQ). Representative diagram for the former
(latter) process is shown in the upper left (right) panel of Fig. 16. The partonic

We show, in Table 8, total cross section for pair production of LQs using
Eqs. (119) and (120) at √s = 1.8 TeV proton-antiproton center-of-mass energy
for diﬀerent LQ masses. To obtain numerical results for the case of p ¯p collider
we resort to MSTW 2008 parton distribution functions [303] at the leading order
and set αs(mZ) = 0.13939. These results are relevant for Tevatron and can be
directly compared with results presented in Table 1 of Ref. [304]. Clearly, at
high enough LQ masses the QCD driven total cross section at p ¯p colliders is
dominated by the quark-antiquark annihilation processes.

The dominant contribution at p p colliders, if we assume that Yukawa cou-
plings are reasonably small, comes from the gluon-gluon fusion processes. To
quantify that we present, in Table 9, QCD driven total cross section at the
leading order for pair production of scalar LQs at √s = 14 TeV proton-proton
center-of-mass energy for diﬀerent LQ masses. Values presented in the second
and third column of Table 9 are obtained integrating over partonic level con-
tributions given in Eqs. (119) and (120), respectively. To do that we again use
MSTW 2008 parton distribution functions [303] at the leading order. Note that
the importance of quark-antiquark annihilation grows with the LQ mass at p p
collider. For example, it amounts to one third (sixth) of gluon-gluon fusion
contribution at mLQ = 1.1 TeV (mLQ = 700 GeV). These cross sections can be
compared with the total cross sections presented in Table 1 of Ref. [305]. (Note
that units of [fb] should be replaced with [pb] in Table 1 of Ref. [305].)

If we allow for non-negligible Yukawa couplings of the LQ to u, d or s quark
the pair production is not driven solely by QCD anymore.
In fact, the LQ
pair production cross section exhibits three distinct regions as a function of the
LQ Yukawa coupling(s). For small enough Yukawa couplings the production is
purely QCD driven. For intermediate values of Yukawa couplings there exists

a region where a negative interference between the QCD diagrams and the t-
channel diagram shown in Fig. 16 decreases the total cross section by up to
15% depending on the quark type (u, d, or s), mass of the LQ and strength
of the coupling. Finally, there is a region of the large Yukawa coupling, where
the t-channel contribution does not only dominate the QCD driven one but
signiﬁcantly enhances the total cross section. We will discuss these features in
more detail later on when we address Yukawa dependence of the cross section
for the single LQ production.

Single LQ production is very relevant at hadron colliders [10, 306, 307, 308,
277, 309, 310]. Moreover, the importance of a combined analysis of the LQ single
and pair production has been demonstrated in Ref. [309] for the Tevatron case.
That work has partially motivated subsequent study presented in Ref. [310]
that produced the combined analysis of the LQ single and pair production at
the level of detector simulation for the LHC.

We show complete set of the leading order Feynman diagrams that are rel-
evant for a single LQ production/exchange and subsequent decay at hadron
colliders that yields two leptons and one jet in the ﬁnal state in Fig. 17. The
diagrams shown in Fig. 17 are an s-channel diagram (upper panel), a t-channel
diagram (lower left panel), and a non-resonant diagram (lower right panel). We
use generic symbols for all the ﬁelds including the LQs.
If one is interested
purely in single LQ production at hadron machines one should disregard a non-
resonant diagram in Fig. 17.

Single LQ production is particularly important in the regime of large LQ
masses and/or large Yukawa couplings. To demonstrate that we compare in
what follows LQ pair production cross section with single production cross sec-
tion for the case of proton-proton collisions at √s = 8 TeV center-of-mass energy.
To that end we, for simplicity, assume that LQs couple to the SM fermions with-
out cross-generational mixing. This ansatz would correspond to the case when
yij = yiδij, i, j = 1, 2, 3, in Figs. 16 and 17. We furthermore notice that both

where coeﬃcients a0(mLQ), a2(mLQ), a4(mLQ), and a(mLQ) depend solely on
the LQ mass. (Clearly, Eqs. (121) and (122) are useful only if yi represents
Yukawa coupling of LQ to u, d or s quark due to proton composition at partonic
level.) We can now calculate cross sections for p p → LQ li, p p → LQ li, and
p p → LQ LQ for several mLQ choices while setting yi to one, i.e, |yi| = 1., to
ﬁnd the functional dependence of a0(mLQ), a2(mLQ), a4(mLQ), and a(mLQ) by
simple interpolation. To do that we implement two LQ models introduced in
sections 1.4 and 1.3 in FeynRules (v1.6.16) [311]. In particular, we look at the
production of ˜R2/3
assuming that either x11 or x22 in Eq. (6) is diﬀerent from
zero and the production of R5/3
assuming that only x11 (cid:54)= 0 in Eq. (4). We
thus take ˜R2/3
to couple only to a down quark d and an electron e or a strange
quark s and a muon µ. R5/3
, on the other hand, is assumed to couple only to
an electron e and an up quark u. To make our notation unambiguous we refer
to these Yukawa couplings in what follows as yde, ysµ and yue, respectively.
We calculate the leading order production cross sections using MadGraph 5
(v1.5.11) [312]. We take √s = 8 TeV for proton-proton center-of-mass energy
and ﬁx renormalization (µR) and factorization (µF ) scales to µR = µF =
mLQ/2. The ﬁnal results for the yue, yde, and ysµ scenarios are shown in Fig. 18
in terms of contours of constant cross section in the (mLQ,|yi|) plane. Note
that in the ˜R2/3
case we separately consider contributions from yde and ysµ.
The contours of constant cross section for the single LQ production (LQ pair
production) are shown in solid (dotted) lines in Fig. 18.

The LQ pair production is QCD driven for small Yukawa couplings. This
behavior corresponds to a region where dotted lines run vertically in Fig. 18.
However, in the large coupling regime, the total cross section can be signiﬁcantly
enhanced by the t-channel contribution. The LQ single production, on the other
hand, vanishes in the zero coupling limit. However, due to the ﬁnal state phase
space, it drops less rapidly with larger LQ masses compared to the LQ pair
production. In other words, the contributions from the single LQ production
mechanism become increasingly important at larger LQ masses. The relative
strengths of two cross sections depend on the parton distribution functions of
the initial state partons. The largest (smallest) eﬀect for the ﬁxed value of
appropriate Yukawa coupling is seen in the yue (ysµ) panels in Fig. 18. To sum
all this up, the contributions from the single LQ production mechanism might
have signiﬁcant impact on the LQ phenomenology at the LHC.

There are two recasts of experimental searches by the CMS Collaboration
for pair production of LQs at LHC [313, 314] that demonstrate the ability of
LHC to probe ﬂavor structure of LQ models through inclusion of the single LQ
production. (For the early study of the discovery potential for pair produced
scalar LQs at LHC of the ATLAS detector see Ref. [315].) These recasts combine

reported data on the pair production searches of LQs with expected signals
for single LQ production in order to obtain collider based limits on relevant
Yukawa couplings as a function of the LQ mass. The ﬁrst recast [313] concerns
the CMS Collaboration search for the second generation scalar LQs based on
19.6 fb−1 of data at √s = 8 TeV proton-proton center-of-mass energy [316]. The
second recast [314] addresses the CMS search for the pair production of the ﬁrst
generation scalar LQs in p p collisions at √s = 8 TeV [317]. In what follows, we
describe the recast of the CMS search reported in Ref. [316] that has yielded an
improved limit on the second generation scalar LQ parameter space [313].

The underling assumption of the CMS search [316] is that the Yukawa cou-
pling of LQ is small enough that the pair production of the second generation
LQs is driven solely by QCD physics but still large enough to insure prompt de-
cay. This assumption also renders single LQ production negligible. The recast
allows for the second generation LQ to couple purely to a strange quark and a
muon via coupling ysµ to stay within the single generation LQ paradigm but
relaxes assumptions on the actual strength of the Yukawa itself. It resorts to the

processes and subsequent decays of ˜R2/3

using Pythia (v6.426) [318] while for the CMS detector simulation is based on
the default Delphes (v3.0.9) [319] implementation. The study disregards non-
resonant diagram in Fig. 17. Also, the analysis is based purely on the leading
order calculations. The inferred exclusion limits are accordingly very conserva-
tive.

µ+, and p p → ˜R2/3

The recast adopts the same preselection and ﬁnal cuts as used in Ref. [316].
The CMS analysis uses the following three variables: (i) the invariant mass of
the dimuon pair (Mµµ), (ii) the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the
two leading pT muons and the two leading pT jets (ST ), and (iii) the smallest
of the two muon-jet invariant masses that minimizes the LQ mass diﬀerence
(Mmin(µ, j)). The ﬁnal cuts used by the CMS Collaboration are shown in Ta-
ble 10.

The cuts in Table 10 are optimized for the QCD pair production and depend
on the LQ mass hypothesis. The relevance of the ﬁnal selection cuts in the large
coupling regime is illustrated in Fig. 19, where the signal event distributions

in ST and Mmin(µ, j) variables are shown after the application of preselection
cuts. LQ mass is chosen to be mLQ = 1 TeV. The signal yield from the QCD
pair production is show in dark-brown thick line. As expected, the distributions
in ST (Mmin(µ, j)) variable tend to peak for ST ∼ 2mLQ (Mmin(µ, j) ∼ mLQ).
Light-brown thin lines are contributions due to LQ pair production for the
value of the coupling set to ysµ = 3.0. The integrated signal yield is larger
compared to the previous case due to additional contributions from the t-channel
diagram. (See Fig. 16.) The events though tend to populate slightly lower ST
and Mmin(µ, j) parameter regions. Finally, the contributions from a single LQ
production for the ysµ = 3.0 case are shown in black thin lines. While the
integrated signal yield is signiﬁcantly larger with respect to previous cases, the
events tend to have considerable smaller ST and Mmin(µ, j) values. The variable
Mmin(µ, j) is thus eﬃcient only in the presence of LQ pair decaying to a ﬁnal
state particles. Furthermore, the muon coming from the production tends to
have considerable smaller pT with respect to the muon coming from the LQ
decay. The same holds for the second leading pT jet, likely originating from
the real QCD radiation, compared to the leading pT jet, likely coming from
the decay. This explains the softer distributions in the ST variable. (We will
quantify these properties towards the end of this section for the ﬁrst generation
scalar LQ case.) Conclusively, applying the appropriate ﬁnal selection cuts from
Table 10, the majority of signal is lost. Nevertheless, the recast keeps the cuts
as used by the CMS Collaboration in order to rely on the oﬃcial background
predictions.

We reproduce the main results of the recast in Table 11. In particular, we
show the signal event yields (Nevs) for certain choices of coupling ysµ and mLQ.
The predictions are given as the sum of two numbers representing the individual
contributions from the LQ pair and single productions, respectively. The points
in parameter space spanned by ysµ and mLQ shown in bold in Table 11 are
excluded by the existing data. The improved constraint on the second generation

LQ parameter space is shown in Fig. 20. The parameter region in (mLQ, ysµ)
plane that is excluded at 95% C.L. by the existing LHC data is shown in grey.
As advocated before, the limits on the LQ masses are more stringent for larger
values of µ–s–LQ coupling.

One expects that all previously discussed eﬀects will be even more enhanced
for the ﬁrst generation case due to particularities of proton composition when-
ever LQ couples to either u or d quarks. We show in Fig. 21 the expected signal
event distributions in Mmin(µ, j) and ST variables for the ﬁrst generation LQ
case at LHC to illustrate this point. We assume that LQ couples only to a u
quark and an electron via Yukawa we refer to as yue. For deﬁniteness we sim-
ulate signal using R5/3
scalar LQ with x11 = yue assuming that mLQ = 1 TeV.
(See Eq. (4).) The center-of-mass energy is 8 TeV and integrated luminosity is
19.6 fb−1. We include in simulation a process associated with the non-resonant
diagram from Fig. 17 that was completely neglected in the second generation
LQ recast. It is clear that this time the single LQ production signal feeds into
the pair production parameter space even for moderate values of Yukawas. This
has also been conﬁrmed by the recast [314] of the CMS search [317] for the pair
production of the ﬁrst generation scalar LQs in p p collisions at √s = 8 TeV.
The authors of Ref. [314] have produced exclusion limits on Yukawa coupling y
of the ﬁrst generation LQ for two diﬀerent LQ scenarios as a function of mLQ
considering possible coexistence of eejj and eνjj ﬁnal states. This has been
accomplished by overlying the signal of the single LQ production and subse-
quent decay over the pair production. (See, for example, Fig. 3 of Ref. [314] for
quantitative results.)

Note that the non-resonant contribution is subleading even in the ﬁrst gen-
eration scenario. If we accordingly neglect non-resonant contribution one of the
two leptons in the ﬁnal state of the single LQ production processes would always

It is expected that this lepton should be the leading one of
the two in the pT parameter space, where pT is a transverse momentum. We
accordingly present in Fig. 22 an example of pT distributions of two charged
leptons in the ﬁnal state of the single LQ production process at LHC. Electron
e1 originates from the production of ﬁrst generation scalar LQ whereas electron
e2 comes from the actual LQ decay. Our simulation is based on mLQ = 1.5 TeV
for p p collisions at 13 TeV. Clearly, pT distribution of e2 that is rendered in
thick lines in Fig. 22 peaks at much higher values of transverse momentum
when compared to the e1 distribution. We also show the pseudorapidity (η) dis-
tribution of the ﬁrst generation scalar LQ in the single LQ production process
at LHC in Fig. 22 to show that LQ should occupy region of small values of η.
Pseudorapidity η is deﬁned as η = − ln[tan(θ/2)], where θ is the angle between
the particle momentum and the beam axis. Both panels in Fig. 22 are based on
simulation of the signal for ﬁrst generation LQ that couples exclusively to a d
quark and an electron e.

The next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the LQ pair production are
shown to substantially enhance the tree level cross section for pair production of
LQs at LHC [305]. That work has built upon previous study that investigated
pair production of scalar LQs at the Tevatron [304] at the next-to-leading order.
The main result of the analysis is the total cross section including next-to-
leading order QCD corrections and associated K-factors for p p → LQ + LQ +
X at the LHC energy of √s = 14 TeV. These are summarised in Table 1 of
Ref. [305]. Here, K-factor is simply deﬁned as K = σNLO/σLO, where σLO
(σNLO) represents leading (next-to-leading) order cross section. The K-factor
was found to vary from K = 1.48 for mLQ = 200 GeV to K = 2.07 for mLQ =
2 TeV [305].

Pair production of the ﬁrst generation scalar LQs at the LHC to next-to-
leading order accuracy using the MC@NLO formalism (with parton shower
matching) has been investigated in Ref. [320]. The authors have evaluated pair
production cross sections and associated K-factors at center-of-mass energy of
√s = 14 TeV. These can be found in Table 1 of Ref. [320] for two diﬀerent sets
of parton distribution functions. One can compare these results with results
presented in Ref. [305]. We show central values of one set of cross sections and
K-factors from Ref. [320] in Table 12. These values are based on CTEQ6(M/L1)
parton distribution functions [321].

Single LQ productions and decays have also been a target of the next-to-
leading order study [322]. (See, for example, Fig. 17 for diagrams of relevant
leading order contributions and Figs. 2, 3, and 4 of Ref. [322] for representa-
tive diagrams of next-to-leading order corrections to the LQ production and
decay processes.) It has been conclusively demonstrated that the higher order
corrections are signiﬁcant for production of both scalar LQ (R2) and vector
LQ (U1). These can amount to a 100% correction with regard to the leading
order result. The core process under investigation was u + g → e− + e+ + u
(d + g → e− + e+ + d) for scalar (vector) scenario. The authors of Ref. [322]
have, in particular, investigated the eﬀectiveness of the narrow-width approxi-
mation in the context of the next-to-leading order approach. This assumption

in the case of the vector LQ. The authors attributed this to the fact that one
cannot neglect the interference between the diﬀerent helicity states of the inter-
mediate vector LQs. Relevant results for the leading and next-to-leading order
cross sections are summarized in Tables 1 through 7 of Ref. [322].

Another potentially relevant analysis that can in principle be carried out at
the LHC is a search for the indirect LQ eﬀects in the tails of the distributions,
such as, dilepton invariant mass in p p → (cid:96) (cid:96) [323, 324]. For initial study on
sensitivity of both e+ e− colliders and hadron-hadron colliders to the indirect
eﬀects of virtual scalar LQs see Ref. [325].

5.5.1. Searches at p ¯p colliders

First results on the LQ parameter space that were inferred from the p ¯p col-
lider data came from the CERN proton-antiproton collider SPS. In the proton-
antiproton regime the SPS collider was aptly referred to as Sp¯pS. For example,
UA2 detector at the CERN Sp¯pS collider was investigating pair production of
ﬁrst generation LQs with their subsequent decays into a quark and either an
electron or an electron neutrino. (A possibility to study single production of
scalar LQs at Sp¯pS has been investigated in Ref. [326].) The center-of-mass
collision energy was √s = 630 GeV and the sample was based on an integrated
luminosity of 13 pb−1. The lack of signal allowed the UA2 Collaboration to
establish a lower limit on the mass of ﬁrst generation LQs at 67 GeV (76 GeV)
at 95% C.L. assuming that the branching ratio for a scalar LQ to decay into a
quark and an electron was at 50% (100%) [327]. The LQ production and the
LQ decay analyses at UA2 were based on the leading order contributions using
results of Ref. [10]. (For the study of higher order QCD corrections that would
increase the predicted production cross section at Sp¯pS see Ref. [328].)

LQs have been searched for at the Fermilab Tevatron, a p ¯p collider, by the
DØ [329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335] and CDF [336, 337, 338] Collaborations.
DØ has published results of a search for the pair production of ﬁrst generation
scalar LQs in the eejj channel using a data set amounting to 123 pb−1 of data
that were collected during the 1992–1996 time period [330]. A lower limit was
consequently set on the mass of a ﬁrst generation scalar LQ of 225 GeV. The
underlying assumption was that the hypothetical LQ had a 100% branching
fraction to eq pair. The CDF Collaboration has also presented the results of
a search for ﬁrst generation scalar LQs using (110 ± 7) pb−1 of data [338]. It
excluded scalar LQs with mass less than 213 GeV at 95% C.L. for a branching
ratio into eq equal to 1. The results of the CDF and DØ Collaborations have
then been combined to yield the most stringent Tevatron limit on the mass
of ﬁrst generation scalar LQ [339]. The combined lower limit on mLQ from
the two experiments is 242 GeV. DØ Collaboration has also searched for scalar
LQ pair production in the euνed ﬁnal state with 5.4 fb−1 of data recorded at
√s = 1.96 TeV. The lack of a signal led to a lower limit on mLQ of 326 GeV for
β = 0.5 at the 95% C.L. [335].

DØ has also reported results of a search for pair production of second gen-
eration scalar LQs that was based on a data set produced in p ¯p collisions at

81

the center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV amounting to 1.0 fb−1 of integrated lu-
minosity [332]. It was assumed that the LQ in question could decay to both
µq and νq pairs. Since DØ did not notice any excess over the SM prediction
the Collaboration has set lower limits on the LQ mass of 316 GeV (270 GeV) for
β = 1 (0.5).

Finally, DØ has also investigated pair production of third generation LQs
that decay exclusively to a τ neutrino and a b quark using the 5.2 fb−1 data
set [334]. Lack of any excess allowed the Collaboration to set a lower limit on
the LQ mass of 247 GeV at 95% C.L..

5.5.2. Searches at p p collider

We summarize here current status of experimental searches for LQs at LHC
that were conducted by the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations. We again note
that the terms “electron”, “muon”, and “tau” are used generically to refer to cor-
responding particles and anti-particles, if not otherwise stated, in what follows.
The ATLAS experiment has performed a search for ﬁrst generation scalar
LQs in p p collisions at √s = 7 TeV using 1.03 fb−1 of data [340]. The events
under investigation had at least two jets and either two oppositely charged
electrons or one electron and missing energy. The observed event yields were
in agreement with the background expectations due to the SM physics. The
ATLAS experiment has accordingly excluded ﬁrst generation scalar LQs with
masses below 660 GeV (607 GeV) for β = 1 (β = 0.5) at 95% C.L.. (We always
denote with β the LQ decay rate into a charged lepton and a quark.)

The ATLAS Collaboration has also conducted a search for the production of
second generation scalar LQs with a total of 1.03 fb−1 integrated luminosity of
proton-proton collision data produced at √s = 7 TeV at LHC. This time the ﬁnal
states that were looked at consisted of either two oppositely charged muons and
at least two jets or a muon plus missing transverse momentum and at least two
jets. Since the observed event yield was in agreement with the expectations for
the SM physics generated background the ATLAS Collaboration has excluded
the production of second generation scalar LQs for mLQ < 685 (594) GeV for a
branching ratio of β = 1.0 (β = 0.5) at 95% conﬁdence level [341].
The CMS Collaboration has also presented a search for the pair produc-
tion of ﬁrst- and second-generation scalar LQs at center-of-mass energy √s =
7 TeV [342]. The data sample that was used for analysis corresponded to an
integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb−1. The events under investigation involved at
least two jets and either two charged leptons of the same ﬂavor or a single
charged lepton and missing transverse energy. We will not discuss initial selec-
tion criteria but will again mention variables that are used for event selection
optimization. These are the invariant mass of the dilepton pair (Mll), the scalar
sum of the transverse momenta (Sll
T = pT (l1) + pT (l2) + pT (j1) + pT (j2)) of
the two leading pT leptons (l1 and l2) and the two leading pT jets (j1 and j2),
and the smallest of the two lepton-jet invariant masses that minimizes the LQ
mass diﬀerence (M min
). The outcome of the analysis was an exclusion of scalar
LQ pair production at the 95% C.L. for masses below 830 GeV (840 GeV) for
the ﬁrst (second) generation LQs assuming β = 1. The exclusion changed to

mLQ < 640 GeV (mLQ < 650 GeV) for the ﬁrst (second) generation LQs for
β = 0.5 [342].

The ATLAS Collaboration has performed a search for third generation scalar
LQs through pair production using an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb−1 of data.
These data were recorded at √s = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The under-
lying assumption was that LQs decay to a τ and a b with a branching fraction
equal to 100%, i.e., β = 1. The fact that no deviation was observed with respect
to the SM expectation allowed the ATLAS Collaboration to establish a lower
limit on the third generation scalar LQ masses of 534 GeV at 95% conﬁdence
level [208]. This limit was improved upon by the CMS Collaboration [343].
Namely, a search for pair production of third-generation scalar LQs that decay
exclusively into τ leptons and b quarks resulted in lower limits on the LQ masses
of 740 GeV at 95% conﬁdence level. The CMS search was based on a data sam-
ple of proton-proton collisions at √s = 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 19.7 fb−1. The CMS Collaboration has also conducted a search for
pair production of third generation scalar LQs of electric charge −1/3 that decay
exclusively into τ leptons and t quarks [344] using the data set corresponding
to integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb−1 that was taken at a center-of-mass energy
of √s = 8 TeV. The events that were studied contained an electron or a muon,
a hadronically decaying τ, and two or more jets. The fact that the observations
were found to be consistent with the SM predictions allowed for exclusion of
third generation LQs up to a mass of 685 GeV at 95 % C.L..
Single production of scalar LQs in p p collisions at √s = 8 TeV was studied
with the CMS detector [345, 346]. Namely, the CMS Collaboration has con-
ducted a search for production of ﬁrst (second) generation scalar LQs with a
ﬁnal state comprising two electrons (muons) and one jet. The data set that was
used in analysis corresponded to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 fb−1. Note
that the event selection for the single production of scalar LQs utilises the in-
variant mass of the dilepton pair (Mll) and the scalar sum of the transverse
momenta (ST = pT (l1) + pT (l2) + pT (j1)) of the two leading pT leptons (l1 and
l2) and the leading pT jet (j1). The two leptons were required to be of opposite
electric charges. Due to agreement between observed candidate events and ex-
pected background events the CMS Collaboration produced exclusion limits on
mLQ as a function of Yukawa coupling y. We reproduce in Table 13 the content
of Table 2 of Ref. [345] that shows relevant exclusion limits on the LQ mass.

Figure 23: The best ﬁt of the CMS observed anomaly for mLQ = 650 GeV.

There were also two searches for pair-production of ﬁrst generation [317]
and second generation scalar LQs [316] that were performed by the CMS Col-
laboration using proton-proton collision data at √s = 8 TeV. The ﬁnal states
under investigation were required to contain two electrons and at least two jets
or an electron, a neutrino, and at least two jets in case of the ﬁrst generation
scalar LQ search [317]. The second generation search required charged leptons
in the ﬁnal state to be muons. The data in both instances corresponded to
an integrated luminosity of 19.6 fb−1 and were collected by the CMS detector
at LHC. Although the CMS Collaboration has excluded ﬁrst generation scalar
LQs with masses less than 1005 GeV (845 GeV) for β = 1 (β = 0.5) [317] it has
observed, in both channels, a signiﬁcant excess in the ﬁnal selection optimized
for LQs with a mass of 650 GeV. We show in Fig. 23 best ﬁt of the observed
anomaly assuming that the branching fractions of LQ to go into ej or νj are not
related to each other. We also ﬁx mass of LQ to be 650 GeV. Obviously, if the
anomaly is real the LQ should decay into something else rather than the ﬁrst
generation charged leptons. The most obvious solution is to have an LQ that
can also couple to muons (and/or taus) but the constraints coming from the
search for the second generation LQs do not allow for this possibility. Namely,
the CMS Collaboration has excluded second generation scalar LQs with masses
less than 1070 GeV (785 GeV) for β = 1 (β = 0.5) [316].

This anomaly has accordingly attracted attention of the high energy physics
community and there were several proposals put forth to explain the observed
discrepancy between the experimental signal and the SM expectations [347,
348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355]. For example, the authors of Ref. [349]
have constructed a scenario that was able to account for the mild excess in the
eejj and eνjj channels that was observed by the CMS search for ﬁrst genera-
tion LQs [317] through very speciﬁc combination of branchings and kinematics.
(The same scenario was used to accommodate the CMS observed (cid:96)+(cid:96)−jjE/T ex-
cess [356] in Ref. [357]. However, the explanation of the (cid:96)+(cid:96)−jjE/T excess has
required use of diﬀerent part of parameter space with regard to the one used
to address excesses in the eejj and eνjj channels.) The study of Ref. [353],

on the other hand, has investigated the correlation between the eejj and eνjj
CMS excess and the resonant enhancement in the very high energy shower event
rates at the IceCube experiment within a context of a simple LQ scenario. (The
production and subsequent decay of scalar LQs — R2 and ˜R2 — within a frame-
work of uniﬁcation model based on the SU (4)C × SU (2)L × U (1)R gauge group
product at IceCube experiment has been discussed in Ref. [358].)
The CMS Collaboration has provided an update on the search for pair-
production of ﬁrst generation and second generation scalar LQs that was per-
formed by using proton-proton collision data at √s = 8 TeV [359]. This time an
integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb−1 was used to exclude ﬁrst generation scalar LQs
with masses less than 1010 GeV (850 GeV) for β = 1.0 (β = 0.5), where β repre-
sents the branching fraction of a LQ decaying to a charged lepton and a quark.
The second generation scalar LQ limit, on the other hand, is mLQ > 1080 GeV
(mLQ > 760 GeV) for β = 1.0 (β = 0.5). The ﬁnal states under consideration
were required to contain either two charged leptons and two jets, or one charged
lepton, one neutrino and two jets.

Finally, the ATLAS Collaboration has recently reported a search for pair
produced scalar LQs in 8 TeV p p collisions with full 20 fb−1 of luminosity [360].
Stringent exclusion limits at 95 % C.L. are set on the ﬁrst (mLQ > 1.05 TeV) and
second (mLQ > 1.00 TeV) generation LQs. Shown in Fig. 24 (left plot) are the
expected and observed limits on σ × β2 for LQ pair production with subsequent
LQ decay to e-jet ﬁnal state. Blue line, on the other hand, represents the
predicted cross section (for β = 1) in QCD. It is interesting to notice that
the recent ATLAS analysis rules out the slight excess seen in the CMS search
(Fig. 24 (right plot)) for mLQ around 650 GeV.

6. Conclusions

Physics of LQs is a very rich and mature subject. At the same time, it is
still a rapidly evolving ﬁeld on both experimental and theoretical fronts. The
experimental constraints on these hypothetical particles that can turn quarks
into leptons and vice versa are set to continue being improved in currently
running, upcoming and future planned high energy and precision experiments.
And, our ability to provide theoretical predictions of their presence goes hand
in hand with this experimental quest.

The main focus of this review was on the phenomenology of light LQs that
are relevant for precision experiments and particle colliders. We accordingly
presented constraints on the LQ interactions with matter from precision low en-
ergy observables such as electric and magnetic dipole moments of SM fermions,
atomic parity violation, neutral meson mixing, K, B, and D meson decays to
name but a few examples. We also addressed complementary constraints that
originate from electroweak precision measurements, top, and Higgs physics. We
ﬁnally discussed and summarized the current status of direct LQ searches at
colliders.

Direct searches for LQs have pushed model independent lower limits on their
masses up to a TeV scale. For example, the CMS (ATLAS) Collaboration has
excluded ﬁrst generation scalar LQs with masses less than 1005 GeV (1050 GeV)
with the 8 TeV p p collision data. And, these limits are expected to become
even more stringent in the near future with run II and HL LHC data. Indi-
rect searches are also reaching unprecedented levels of accuracy and precision,
cornering the available parameter space of LQ couplings to matter.

The hope is that LQs will eventually be experimentally observed. A LQ
discovery would certainly point towards uniﬁcation of quarks and leptons. It
might happen that the LQ detection could be further correlated with other
observed phenomena that are not well accommodated within the SM. Here we
primarily refer to neutrino masses, anomalies in ﬂavor physics, dark matter,
and potential anomalies in collider physics. This, in our view, would nicely
dovetail with the observed uniﬁcation of weak and electromagnetic interactions
and potentially usher in a new era in particle physics.
