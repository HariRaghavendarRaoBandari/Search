NUMERICAL STUDY OF A RECENT BLACK HOLE LASING EXPERIMENT

Abstract. We theoretically analyse a recent experiment reporting the observation of a self-amplifying Hawking
radiation in a ﬂowing atomic condensate [1]. We are able to accurately reproduce the experimental observations
using a theoretical model based on the numerical solution of a mean-ﬁeld Gross-Pitaevskii equation that does
not include quantum ﬂuctuations of the matter ﬁeld. In addition to conﬁrming the black hole lasing mechanism,
our results show that the underlying dynamical instability has a classical hydrodynamic origin and is triggered
by a deterministic process rather than by thermal or zero-point ﬂuctuations.

1. Introduction

In 1974 S.Hawking demonstrated that black holes “evaporate” as a consequence of quantum eﬀects [2, 3].
That is, they emit particles in the form of thermal radiation at a temperature TH = κ/(2πkBc) where κ is
the horizon’s surface gravity, κ = c4/(4GM ) for a Schwarzschild black hole. Observing this stunning feature
is not an easy task, due to the fact that the temperature depends on the inverse of the black hole mass; in
fact, for the case of an astrophysical black hole of mass M , we have TH (cid:39) 10−7 M(cid:12)
M K which is well below the
cosmic microwave background radiation temperature; therefore, a revelation of this phenomenon through an
astrophysical observation is very unlikely.
On the other hand, the Hawking eﬀect is a kinematical eﬀect of quantum ﬁelds in curved spacetime and it
only relies on the existence of a curved metric and a horizon. Thanks to these characteristics, it exists an
alternative way to test Hawking’s theories which was proposed by W. G. Unruh in 1981 [4] and is based on the
mathematical analogy between the propagation of long wavelength sound waves in inhomogeneous and moving
ﬂuids and that of massless scalar ﬁelds in curved backgrounds. In particular, sound waves get trapped in regions
of supersonic ﬂow in the same way as light is trapped inside a gravitational black hole. This was the starting
point to develop an analogy from gravitational black holes to acoustic ones. This way, in fact, one could seek
to reproduce analogues of black holes in the laboratories and, pushing the analogy further to the quantum
level, one could hope to observe eﬀects of quantum ﬁeld theory on curved backgrounds in acoustic analogue
systems. This opened up new possibilities to experimentally test Hawking’s predictions. In the past years many
systems in diﬀerent ﬁelds of physics have been explored towards the observation of this eﬀect [5]. Among the
most promising ones, pulse propagation in non-linear optical media [6–8], quantum ﬂuids of light [9–13], atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates of ultra cold atoms [14–16] and, restricting to a classical regime, surface waves on
water [17–19].

This Letter is devoted to a detailed study of a recent experiment performed by Jeﬀ Steinhauer at Technion and
claiming the observation of a self-amplifying Hawking radiation via the black-hole laser mechanism in a ﬂowing
atomic Bose-Einstein condensate [1]. We make use of a numerical simulation to quantitatively reproduce the
experimental data. Based on this theory, we propose a critical interpretation of the experiments and we discuss
their implications in the framework of the on-going quest for the experimental observation of a spontaneous
Hawking emission from zero-point ﬂuctuations.

2. The 2014 Technion experiment

The experiment described in [1] creates a sonic black hole by means of a Bose-Einstein condensate accelerated
to supersonic speed. The setup is realized with 87Rb atoms subject to a combination of magnetic and optical
potentials: a magnetic ﬁeld gradient and a laser beam constrict the condensate in the transverse directions to
a tube-like volume, forcing the dynamics to be nearly one-dimensional, and provide a shallow conﬁning trap
potential along the longitudinal direction. Then a suitable, step-like longitudinal optical potential (called the
“waterfall” potential) accelerates the atoms above the speed of sound within a ﬁnite region along the longitudinal

direction, thus creating a pair of analogue black hole and white hole horizons: on one side of the region the
phonons cannot exit while on the other side they cannot enter.

In Fig. 1 we give a representation of our longitudinal potential, which was constructed in order to ﬁt the
experimental one. During the experiment, the conﬁning part of the longitudinal potential remains at rest while
the step-like waterfall potential is swept along the condensate at constant speed in the rightward direction; this
way, on the right side of the step the condensate is slowly moving while on the left side it ﬂows at a much faster
supersonic speed with respect to the waterfall potential. The step is therefore responsible for the creation of
the black hole horizon, which moves at a constant speed. Due to the shallow conﬁning trap potential, the ﬂow
velocity far away on the left side of the step slowly decreases again until it gets again subsonic at the white hole
horizon.

In the experiment, the system is let evolve for 120 ms and the condensate density is imaged at seven instants
of time with a phase contrast imaging technique. For each of these times, an ensemble of approximately 80
images is collected and then averaged to reduce noise. From the resulting density proﬁle, the spatial proﬁles of
the condensate velocity and of the speed of sound are ﬁnally extracted.

Figure 1. Snapshot of the longitudinal potential used in our simulation (to be compared to
Fig. 1c from [1]) at time t = 20 ms. WH and BH indicate the position of the inner white
hole horizon and the outer black hole horizon respectively. In our numerical simulation, the
condensate ﬂows from the right to the left, which is Galilean-equivalent to the experimental
conﬁguration where the step-like waterfall potential is moved in the rightward direction.

3. The numerical model

The starting point of our model is the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) [20], which represents
a good approximation for the dynamics of a dilute Bose gas. In order to describe a nearly one-dimensional
system, we follow Ref. [21] and trace out the transverse degrees of freedom, so to obtain the so-called Non-
Polynomial Schr¨odinger Equation (NPSE) appropriate for a harmonic transverse conﬁnement potential:

with parameters V0, z0, v, a, Vs, σ and c chosen to ﬁt the experimental “waterfall” potential described in [1]. In
particular, to better match the experiment, the step-like waterfall potential has been smoothed with a tanh(z)
function. A snapshot of the resulting total potential at time t = 20 ms is represented in Fig. 1. Note that for
numerical convenience reasons, we have preferred to move the trap in the leftward, negative-z direction and to
keep the waterfall potential at rest. This setting is anyway fully equivalent to the experimental one in [1] since
the two conﬁgurations are related by a Galileian transformation.

As an initial condition, we consider the ground state wavefunction that is obtained from an imaginary-time
NPSE evolution in the presence of interactions and of the harmonic trapping but in the absence of the waterfall
potential. More precisely, we start the evolution at t = −50 ms when the step of the waterfall potential is still
far to the left of the trap minimum and the condensate does not touch it. According to the above-mentioned
Galilean transformation, the atoms are also given an initial velocity in the negative z direction equal to the
trap’s velocity, so no spurious acceleration stage is introduced at the beginning of the simulation.

We proceed by numerically integrating eq. (1) and evaluating the axial density n(z, t) = N|f (z, t)|2.

4. Results

As a ﬁrst result, we verify that the conﬁguration of a black hole-white hole pair is recovered by calculating the
condensate and the sound velocity. Within the NPSE approach [21], the former is obtained by means of the
one-dimensional continuity equation1 as:

the white hole horizon. As it is discussed in the text, these are included by means of 10%
ﬂuctuations on the intensity of the waterfall potential Vs. In both panels the curves are the
temporal average over the 120 ms corresponding to Fig. 3. A well-deﬁned supersonic region is
clearly visible inside the two horizons in both cases.

The averages of these two quantities over the evolution interval are shown in Fig. 2(a). A pair of analogue
black hole and white hole horizons is evident from the presence of a spatially limited supersonic region. It is
important to notice that our results agree with the experimental observations shown in Fig. 3a of [1] from a
quantitative point of view also. Indeed, the sound velocity (solid curve) and the width of the lasing region (the
region of supersonic ﬂow) agree with the experimental results. The only minor discrepancy lies in the stronger
contrast of the fringes shown by the speed of sound and, even more visibly, by the condensate velocity (dotted
curve) in between the two horizons. As it is mentioned in the experimental article, there are some shot-to-shot
ﬂuctuations in the position of the white hole horizon. As the experimental results are obtained by averaging
over many diﬀerent realisations of the experiment, the decrease in the fringe contrast in the region between the
two horizons is likely due to these ﬂuctuations. A brief discussion of their origin will be given in the following
of this work.

shown are taken at 20 ms time intervals and the unit for the y-axis is µm−1. The dotted curves
show the density proﬁle without any additional noise. The solid curves represent the average
of the density proﬁles over 80 realizations when ﬂuctuations in the position of the white hole
horizon are included as done in Fig. 2(b).

5. The density profiles

We turn our attention to the density proﬁles which are shown as dotted lines in Fig. 3: the agreement with
the corresponding experimental proﬁles shown in Fig. 2j-p of [1] is good both in the overall condensate density
and in the width of the lasing region. Most importantly, the characteristic fringe pattern in the region between
the two horizons is also quantitatively recovered and it is apparent how the amplitude of these fringes grows

in time, as observed in the experimental data. In [1] this was interpreted as a main signature of the so-called
“black hole laser” eﬀect [22, 23].

When two horizons are present, sound waves which bounce back and forth in the region between the two
horizons get ampliﬁed by the horizons at each reﬂection via a mode-conversion mechanism that often goes under
the name of stimulated Hawking emission. The interference of these two counter propagating waves produces a
growing fringe pattern in the region between the two horizons, which behaves as a laser cavity for sound waves.
In the classiﬁcation of instabilities proposed in [24–26], our conﬁguration seem to correspond to a dynamical
instability purely imaginary energy showing no oscillations. From the presence of the self-amplifying negative
energy waves between the horizons, it is then natural [1] to infer that a growing density modulation must be
emitted from the region between the horizons into the outer condensate: even though this eﬀect is partially
obscured by the ﬁnite size of the actual condensate, a such density modulation can be spotted in the late time
panels of Fig. 3, mostly in the x > 0 region.

As compared to the experiment [1], it is important to note how the fringe pattern predicted by our simulations
again shows a larger contrast. As already mentioned for the condensate velocity and the speed of sound, this is
likely to be due to the experimental ﬂuctuations in the position of the white hole horizon; a complete discussion
of this eﬀect, including some analysis of the ﬁne structure of the fringe pattern, will be given in the following
of this Letter. Nevertheless, the key conclusion of our work so far is that the same interference pattern can be
reproduced starting from a simulation based on the mean-ﬁeld Gross-Pitaevskii description of the condensate.
In our theory, the phonon ﬁeld, whose zero-point ﬂuctuations would be responsible for the spontaneous Hawking
radiation, is fully classical. Yet the theory recovers the same interference pattern observed in the experiment,
which indicates that the phenomenon observed is indeed due to a classical hydrodynamical instability eﬀect.

6. The seed

It remains to be explained what is the initial seed for the dynamical instability leading to the eventual
fast growth of the fringe pattern. The numerical simulations of Fig. 3 again provide a neat answer: as it is
particularly clear in the third panel from the top for t = 60 ms, the wave pattern is seen to ﬁrst appear at
the white hole horizon and then to propagate towards the black hole horizon. This suggests that the most
natural candidate for the seed is the Bogoliubov-Cerenkov eﬀect [27], also called “undulation” in the analogue
model literature [28]: This process is responsible for the appearance of a static density modulation whenever a
condensate ﬂowing at supersonic speed encounters an obstacle, in our case the growing harmonic trap potential
in the region around the white hole horizon. The deterministic nature of the Bogoliubov-Cerenkov emission
process then reﬂects in the fact that the fringes also have a deterministic character, with a well deﬁned position
and amplitude.
In particular, this shows that there is no need of invoking non-linear eﬀects to explain the
non-vanishing average of the density modulation when starting from a stochastic, either quantum or thermal,
seed [24].

To further illustrate the stability of the classical dynamics against additional ﬂuctuation eﬀects, we have
repeated our simulations adding some noise to the interacting ground state used as an initial condition of the
NPSE evolution,

(5)

¯f0(z) = f0(z) [1 + η(z)],

where η(z) is a random variable with a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance (independent
of z) and  determines the amplitude of noise; both cases of a real and a complex η have been considered. The
results are shown in Fig. 4, where we compare the density proﬁle at t = 60 ms with the proﬁle at the same time
once we apply a noise of intensity  = 10−1 to the initial condition. It is easy to see in this ﬁgure that the fringe
pattern inside the lasing region is not washed out by the initial random noise and keeps its qualitative structure
in spite of the added noise. This result is a further conﬁrmation that the observed fringe pattern has a classical
origin and that there is no need of invoking quantum phenomena to explain the experimental observations.

We now proceed to explain and interpret the diﬀerences between the experimental observations and our
theory that we have previously mentioned out at several points of this Letter. Inspired by a remark in the
experimental article [1] that “This occurs because the position of the inner horizon [...] varies slightly from
realization to realization” we have investigated the eﬀect of shot-to-shot ﬂuctuations in the precise position of
the white-hole horizon. Even though the strength of the optical potentials is actively stabilized to a extremely

Figure 4. The density proﬁles at t = 60 ms. The solid curve shows the density proﬁle when no
noise is added while the dotted one is obtained by adding a random gaussian noise of intensity
 = 10−1 to the initial condition.

Figure 5. Density-density correlation function (6) evaluated at the latest evolution time
t = 120 ms. The left plot includes noise in the initial wavefunction according to eq. (5) as
done in Fig. 4.
In the right panel, ﬂuctuations originate from a ﬂuctuating position of the
white hole horizon as done in Fig. 3.

high degree in the actual experiment2, in the absence of more speciﬁc information on other possible mechanisms,
we choose to introduce into the simulation a random gaussian noise on the height of the waterfall potential,
whose main consequence is indeed (see Fig. 1c of [1]) to displace the position of the white hole horizon while
keeping the black hole one ﬁxed. We then repeated our simulation for diﬀerent realizations of the random
ﬂuctuations, and we take the average of the observable data. The variance of the ﬂuctuations is chosen in a
way to optimize the qualitative agreement with the experimental observations [1]. As expected, this choice
corresponds to a value of the white hole horizon displacement of the order of the fringe spacing.

The results of the average over 80 realizations of the noise (as well as over time) for the condensate and sound
velocities are shown in Fig. 2(b). By comparing these curves with the ones in Fig. 2(a), we can easily see how
the contrast of the fringe pattern inside the lasing region diminishes and both curves now closely resemble the
experimental ones shown in Fig. 3a of [1].

The density proﬁles after diﬀerent evolution times averaged over noise are shown as solid lines in Fig. 3. By
comparing the dotted and the solid curves, it is apparent how the displacement of the white hole horizon greatly
decreases the visibility of the fringes in the region between the two horizons: the position of the maxima and
minima depends on the position of the white hole horizon and therefore changes from realization to realization,
which results in destructive interference once the averages are taken.

Our interpretation is further conﬁrmed by the fact that the averaging procedure is more eﬀective in washing
out the fringes closer to the white hole horizon, while the ones closer to the black hole horizon are less aﬀected.
This remarkable feature is clearly visible in the simulated density proﬁles at late times and fully agrees with
the experimental observation of Fig. 1p of [1]. For sake of completeness, we have also studied the eﬀect of
ﬂuctuations in other quantities, e.g. the total number of particles, that do not directly aﬀect the position of
the white hole horizon, and we have veriﬁed that such eﬀects do not produce any signiﬁcant change in the
observables.

7. Correlation function

In order to complete our analysis and conﬁrm that our model is indeed able to reproduce all main features
of the experiment, we are left with the study of the correlation function of density ﬂuctuations, encoded in the
two point function:

(6)

G(2)(x1, x2) = (cid:104)n(x1)n(x2)(cid:105) − (cid:104)n(x1)(cid:105)(cid:104)n(x2)(cid:105) .

As done in the experiment [1], we calculate eq. (6) for each evolution time by taking the averages over the
diﬀerent realizations of the noise. The results for the latest time are shown in Fig. 5 for two cases: in the left
panel, we have added noise on the initial wavefunction according to eq. 5; in the right panel, we start from
a deterministic initial wavefunction but we include ﬂuctuations in the position of the white-hole horizon as
discussed above.

The left panel is characterized by a well deﬁned chequerboard pattern in the region between the horizons,
corresponding to the density modulation of the black-hole lasing mode shown in Fig. 3. Here, the role of the
initial noise is in fact just to provide a small correction to the deterministic initial amplitude of the lasing mode.
The agreement with the experimental results in Fig. 4 of [1] looks even better for the right panel where density
ﬂuctuations are due to the ﬂuctuating position of the white hole horizon: the chequerboard pattern is present
also in this case, but its clear visibility is restricted to the region close to the black hole horizon. In the vicinity
of the white hole horizon around x1,2 = −15 µm, it is instead partially washed out and is replaced by a series
of fringes parallel to the diagonal. The bands that extend outside the lasing region into the subsonic regions
beyond the horizons can be considered as a signature of the density modulation that propagates into the outer
condensate. Their vertical and horizontal orientation signals that the growing black hole lasing mode does not
oscillate in time.

8. Conclusions

In this work we have theoretically studied the recent experiment [1] reporting the observation of self-
amplifying Hawking radiation in an analog black hole laser conﬁguration with a pair of black hole and white
hole horizons in a ﬂowing atomic condensate. Our work is based on a numerical solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation describing at mean-ﬁeld level the dynamics of the condensate using the experimental parameters. As
a main result of our study, we showed how such a classical approach is able to reproduce in a quantitative way
the experimental observations without the need of invoking quantum ﬂuctuation eﬀects.

On one hand our simulations conﬁrm the ampliﬁcation mechanism, referred to as black hole laser, for an
analogue black hole-white hole pair. On the other hand, they also show that the mechanism seeding the classical
hydrodynamical instability responsible for the black hole laser eﬀect has a deterministic nature, which leads to
a well-deﬁned amplitude and phase of the fringe pattern in the density proﬁle, and can be related to a classical
Bogoliubov-Cerenkov emission in the white hole horizon region. Finally, the ﬁne details of the observed density
proﬁles and of the density ﬂuctuation correlation function can be explained in terms of classical shot-to-shot
ﬂuctuations in the position of the inner white hole horizon.

Future work will address the challenging problem of including zero-point quantum ﬂuctuations into the the-
oretical model. Among the possible approaches, one may consider generalizing the Wigner method [29] from

8

single black hole horizons in inﬁnitely extended condensates [15] to more realistic geometries where an initially
trapped condensate is sent against a waterfall potential. If successful, this study will have a crucial importance
to characterize in a quantitatively accurate way the observable consequences of spontaneous Hawking processes.
