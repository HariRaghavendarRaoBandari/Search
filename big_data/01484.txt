Geometric mean, splines and de Boor algorithm in

geodesic spaces

Esfandiar Nava-Yazdani

Abstract

We extend the concepts of de Casteljau and de Boor algorithms as well as splines to
geodesic spaces and present some applications in geometric modeling. The concept of
weighted geometric mean provides another approach to splines. We compare the corre-
sponding B´ezier curves and show that for Riemannian manifolds, their endpoint tangents
coincide.

Introduction

A geodesic space is a metric space where any two points can be joined by a shortest
geodesic realizing the distance between those points. If there is a unique shortest geodesic
between any two points (unique geodesic spaces), aﬃne combination of points is well
deﬁned and in turn, the natural and general setting for de Casteljau and de Boor algo-
rithms is provided. This construction shares many interesting properties with the special
case of manifold-valued data considered in [4], [14], [23] and [19] (as well as [26], [20] and
[25] for subdivision schemes). Moreover, geodesic spaces give rise to a wider range of ap-
plications. A survey on particular geodesic spaces including Alexandrov and Busemann
spaces can be found in [15]. A recent related work, considering subdivision schemes
in metric spaces and link to barycenters in Hadamard spaces, is [8]. Furthermore, an
extrinsic approach to spline curves in embedded manifolds by minimizing energy, and
several signiﬁcant examples can be found in [11] and [12]. Data reﬁnement in nonlinear
geometries is a substantial problem in geometric processing and has a wide range of
applications. Furthermore, many properties and applications of Bernstein polynomials
immediately extend to analogous constructions in geodesic spaces. For example, an
i where Bn
i

Rm-valued function f can be approximated by the polynomial(cid:80)n

i=0 f (i/n)Bn

denotes the i-th Bernstein polynomial of degree n. Similar results for manifold-valued
functions are desirable. For Bernstein polynomials on spheres and sphere-like surfaces
we refer to [2]. The intrinsic approach in the present work can be used to construct
B´ezier curves, and more generally, splines. Usually, to ensure well deﬁnedness of our
approach, restriction of control points to a small enough neighbourhood is suﬃcient. In
Riemannian manifolds, the size of this neighbourhood (for the algorithmic construction
of splines to be well deﬁned) is determined by the injectivity radius. In the present work
we focus on geometric modeling.
The concept of geometric mean is important in many applications such as medical imag-
ing and numerical linear algebra (cf. [18] and [9]). Moreover, it plays a signiﬁcant role
in studying some essential geometric and analytic properties. Besides the classic work
[17], we would like to refer to [1], [16], [7] and [6] for some recent progresses and appli-
cations. For a comprehensive treatment of spherical averages and splines, we refer to
[3]. Another approach to splines is provided by considering the geometric mean, with
weights in the corresponding cost functional, being some blending functions. We present
some basic results concerning the existence and uniqueness of the geometric mean, and
brieﬂy compare the corresponding curves with B´ezier curves. In particular, it turns out,
that their tangents at endpoints coincide.
This work is organized as follows. In the next section, we introduce the construction
of B´ezier curves via the de Casteljau algorithm in unique geodesic spaces. The two fol-
lowing sections present rational B´ezier curves, the de Boor algorithm, splines and some
examples. The last section is devoted to the concept of weighted geometric mean, the
resulting curves for the case that the weights in the cost functional are the Bernstein
polynomials and an application of the Karcher equation.

2 De Casteljau algorithm

We recall a few deﬁnitions. Let (M, d) be a metric space. The length L of a curve
c ∈ C 0([0, 1], M ) is

L(c) := sup{n−1(cid:88)

d(c(ti), c(ti+1)) : 0 = t0,··· , tn−1 = 1, n ∈ N}.

c is called geodesic iﬀ there exists  > 0 with

i=0

L(c|[s,t]) = d(c(s), c(t)) whenever |s − t| < .

Deﬁnition 2.1. We call M a unique geodesic space1 iﬀ there exists a continuous map
Φ : M × M → C 0([0, 1], M ) such that for any two points x, y ∈ M
for all 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

L(Φ[0,t](x, y)) = td(x, y)

1Some authors use the terminology, geodesic length space.

2

Any reparametrization of Φ proportional to arclength, provides another shortest geodesic.
Now, suppose that there is a second map ˜Φ with the same properties as Φ. Then
d(Φt(x, y), ˜Φt(x, y)) ≤ d(x, ˜Φt(x, y)) + d(x, Φt(x, y)) = td(x, y) − td(x, y) = 0.

Therefore Φ is unique. We call Φ the aﬃne map of M and use the interval notation for
the image of Φ, i.e., we set

[x, y] = Φ[0,1](x, y), ]x, y[= Φ]0,1[(x, y).

Note that Φ(x, y) is a homeomorphism from [0, 1] onto the geodesic segment joining

x and y. Moreover, in this setting, the notation of betweenness also makes sense:

y ∈ [x, z] ⇔ d(x, y) + d(y, z) = d(x, z).

For example, any neighbourhood of a complete Riemannian manifold within the injec-
tivity radius (in particular, any Hadamard-Cartan manifold) is a unique geodesic space.
Euclidean trees, and more generally, Bruhat-Titz buildings provide examples of non-
manifold geodesic unique spaces. Denoting the Euclidean scalarproduct by (cid:104)., .(cid:105), for any
x, y in an open hemisphere of S2 we have

Φt(x, y) =

sin((1 − t)ϕ)

sin ϕ

x +

sin(tϕ)
sin ϕ

y, with ϕ := arccos((cid:104)x, y(cid:105)).

Note that in general for geodesic spaces, restriction to a small neighbourhood, does not
result in a unique geodesic space. For instance, every neighbourhood in R2 endowed
with the Manhattan (Taxicab) metric deﬁned by

d(x, y) = |x1 − y1| + |x2 − y2|,

is geodesic but not unique. Nevertheless, ﬁxing a representative of identiﬁed geodesics,
an aﬃne map can be simply deﬁned. For example, let k be any function of the slope
of the line through x and y, c = (x + y)/2, g the line passing through the point c with
slope k and x∗ resp. y∗ the nearest point of g to x resp. y. Consider the geodesic
[x, x∗] ∪ [x∗, y∗] ∪ [y∗, y] with [ , ] being Euclidean. Obviously, the corresponding aﬃne
map reads

Throughout this work, unless otherwise stated explicitly, (M, d) will denote a unique
geodesic space and Φ its aﬃne map. Throughout this work, we refer to p0,··· , pn ∈ M
as control points and set I := [0, 1]. Now, we present the deﬁnition of B´ezier curves via
generalized de Casteljau algorithm in unique geodesic spaces.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Fix t ∈ I. Let p0

i (t) := pi, i = 0,··· , n and set

r = 1,··· , n,
i = 0, . . . , n − r,
i (t) := Φt(pr−1

We call I (cid:51) t (cid:55)→ p(t) := pn

0 (t) the B´ezier curve with control points p0,··· , pn.

Obviously this curve is invariant under aﬃne parameter transformations and it lies

in the convex hull

{ΦI([pi, pi+1], [pj, pj+1]) : i, j = 0,··· , n − 1}

of the control points and has the end point property p(0) = p0, p(1) = pn.

Applications of de Casteljau algorithm to some Riemannian manifolds including Lie
groups and more generally, symmetric spaces can be found in [4], [14], [23] and [19].
Next we consider a metric real tree.
Example 2.2. Denote [x, y, z] = 0 iﬀ x, y and z lie in the same geodesic. Let c ∈ M .
The Paris metric dp with respect to c can be deﬁned as

dp(x, y) =

d(x, y)
d(x, c) + d(y, c)

if [x, y, c] = 0,
else.

If (M, d) is the Euclidean plane, then obviously

(1 − t)x + ty

if [x, y, c] = 0,
else

where Rα denotes the rotation by the angle sα with s = sign(det(c − x, y − c)) and
α = ∠(x − c, y − c).

Imposing a further condition on M , B´ezier curves deﬁned in 2.2 enjoy the following

subdivision property.

Theorem 2.1. Suppose that

Φs(Φτ (x, y), Φτ (y, z)) = Φτ (Φs(x, y), Φs(y, z)), s, τ ∈ I, x, y, z ∈ M.

(1)
Then, for any partition 0 < s1 ≤ ··· ≤ sk < 1, the B´ezier curve p can be split into k + 1
B´ezier curves on [0, s1],··· , [sk, 1].

Proof. Let k = 1 and s ∈]0, 1[. Let xi := pi
n that the left segment I (cid:51) t (cid:55)→ plef t(t) := pn
curve x := xn

0(s), i = 0,··· , n. We show by induction on
0 (st) of the B´ezier curve pn
0 and the B´ezier

0 , determined by the control points xi, coincide. The identity

Φt(z0, Φs(z0, z1)) = Φst(z0, z1), s, t ∈ I, z0, z1 ∈ M
is crucial for the proof. Now, ﬁx t ∈ I. Let n = 1. Then x1
Φt(p0, Φs(p0, p1)) = Φst(p0, p1) = p1
the assertion is true for n − 1 control points. Hence xn−1
the point xn−1

Φs(pn−1

(t) is determined by the control points p1
(s)). Hence
(t) = Φt(pn−1

(s), Φs(pn−1
Applying (1) (with τ = st), we get xn−1

(s), pn−1
(t) = φs(pn−1

0(t) = Φt(x0, x1) =
0(st) = plef t(t). Now, suppose that n > 1 and

Hence plef t = x. Reversing the order of the control points and replacing s by 1− s and t
by 1−t, the same argument shows that the right segment I (cid:51) t (cid:55)→ pright(t) := pn
0 (s+t−st)
of the B´ezier curve pn
0 and the B´ezier curve y := yn
0 , determined by the control points

yi = pn−i
y([s, 1]) = {p(s)}. Iterating k completes the proof.

Condition (1) seems to be natural for the compatibility between subdivision prop-
erty and de Casteljau iteration and could be of interest for further investigation. The
following theorem gives further properties of the de Casteljau algorithm. Proofs are
slight modiﬁcations of the Riemannian case presented in [19] and we outline them for
the reader’s convenience.
Theorem 2.2. Consider control points P := (p0, . . . , pn) and Q := (q0, . . . , qn) in U ⊂
M . Then the following holds.
a) Transformation invariance: Suppose a Lie group H acts on M by

H × M (cid:51) (h, x) (cid:55)→ hx ∈ M

leaving U invariant, i.e., HU ⊂ U . Denote B(p0,··· , pn) := p(I).
segment-equivariant, i.e., for every h ∈ G

If the action is

h[x, y] = [hx, hy] for all x, y ∈ U.

Then

hB(p0, . . . , pn) = B(hp0, . . . , hpn) for all h ∈ H.

b) Local control: Suppose that M as embedded in an Euclidean space with any norm (cid:107).(cid:107).
Then

where C denotes a positive constant depending only on n, U .

(cid:107)p − q(cid:107)∞ ≤ C(cid:107)P − Q(cid:107)∞

5

Proof. a) The segments [hpi, hpi+1] and h[pi, pi+1] have the same endpoints:

Φ0(hpi, hpi+1) = hpi = hΦ0(pi, pi+1),
Φ1(hpi, hpi+1) = hpi+1 = hΦ1(pi, pi+1).

b) Fix t ∈ I. Due to ﬁniteness of n there is a positive constant K determined by U and
Lipschitz constants of Φ on U such that
i (t)(cid:107) = (cid:107)Φt(pr−1
≤ K(cid:107)(pr−1

which immediately implies the desired inequality.

3 Rational B´ezier curves

In a geodesic space (M, d), the rational B´ezier curve pn
and positive weights w0,··· , wn can be produced by applying the weighted version of

de Casteljau algorithm as follows. Fix t ∈ I. Let (p0

The following ﬁgures show the eﬀect of weights. We remark that in general, for a
surface of revolution, the geodesic diﬀerential equation reduces to a ﬁrst order one and
can eﬃciently be solved using e.g. ode45 of MATLAB.

Example 3.1. In order to reﬂect constraints caused by the presence of some objects
(without changing the degree of the B´ezier curve), we may choose weights as functions
of distances from control points to the objects. In this example we treat the small disc
B in M as an attracting object. Here each weight is simply chosen as inverse of the
distance between corresponding control point and B, i.e., wi = 1/d(pi,B). Similarly,
avoiding objects can be treated. Of course, due to the convex hull property of B´ezier
curves, the gained ﬂexibility is restricted. For a treatment of obstacles via a variational
approach we refer to [12] and [11].

4 Splines and de Boor algorithm

For a knot vector

τ : τ0 ≤ τ1 ≤ ··· ≤ τm+n+1

with τk < τk+n, τm < τm+1, τn < τn+1 and control points p0,··· , pn in a geodesic space
M with metric d, we deﬁne the de Boor algorithm as follows. Fix t in a knot interval
i (t) := pi, i = l − m,··· , l and set
[τl, τl+1] of the parameter interval [τm, τn+1], deﬁne p0

Then the spline curve p of degree ≤ m evaluated at t is obtained as the ﬁnal value pm
l . If
t = τl with multiplicity µ, then the the scheme simpliﬁes slightly and p(t) = pm−µ
l−µ . Note
that due to continuity, closed knot intervals are permitted. For closed splines, control
points and knots should be extended periodically.

In general, it is not easy to obtain geodesics which are required for the construction
of the splines using the above algorithm. For Riemannian symmetric spaces and in
particular, Lie groups, explicit formulas for the Riemannian exponential map can be
used to reduce the task to calculations with matrix exponential and prinicipal logarithm
accordingly. Next example illustrates these consideration.

i denotes the
i-th Bernstein polynomial of degree n. In the following, we present a general existence
and uniqueness result for the geometric mean and some estimates of the corresponding
cost functional for the case that weights are given by the Bernstein polynomials. We say
that the control points are in general position unless they are contained in a common
geodesic.

Theorem 5.1. Fix t ∈ I. Let Er :=(cid:80)r

a) For any x ∈ M , we have

En(x) ≥ (t(1 − t))n(

d(x, pi))2 ≥ (t(1 − t))n(

d(pi, pi+1))2.

For t ∈]0, 1[, inequalities are strict if and only if the control points are in general position.
b) Suppose that d2(., x) is strictly convex for all x ∈ M . Then the weighted geometric
mean deﬁned by (2) exists and is unique. Denoting qr := argM in(Er), for any n > 1,
the sequence {Er(qr)}r=1,...,n is increasing. It is strictly increasing, provided t ∈]0, 1[.
Proof. a) Note that for any i = 0, . . . , n − 1, we have

i (x) := (1 − t)d2(x, pi) + td2(x, pi+1) ≥ t(1 − t)(d(x, pi) + d(x, pi+1))2

Iteration completes the
proof. Note that for n > 1, the control points are in general position if and only if
for at least one i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}, the triangle pi−1pipi+1 is not degenerated, implying
strictness of the asserted inequalities.
b) As a positive linear combination of proper strictly convex functionals d2(., pi), the cost
functional deﬁning the weighted geometric mean in (2) is proper and strictly convex.
Therefore it attains its unique minimum. Moreover, for any r = 1, . . . , n − 1, denoting

This result can be used to determine the geodesic p1

0 by minimizing E1. Conversely,
the preceding theorem can be applied to determine the geometric mean of two points, if
geodesics are known. More generally, the given lower bounds can be utilized to approx-
imate the minimizer of En with a Casteljau-like algorithm.
Example 5.1. Let M be the space of symmetric positive deﬁnite 2 × 2-matrices and
x, y ∈ M . Then, for any s ∈ I, we have (cf. [26])

Φs(x, y) = x(x−1y)s.

Due to the preceding theorem the geometric mean x#y of x and y is given by

x#y = Φ1/2(x, y) = x(x−1y)1/2.

An application of Cayley-Hamilton’s theorem (see [18]) implies x#y =

points p0, . . . , pn.

Obviously, the centroid curve is continuous and enjoys the endpoint property q(0) =
p0 and q(1) = p1. Due to the endpoint property, several centroid curves can be pieced
together into a spline. While the evaluation of p relies on computation of geodesics, for q
we require (just) geodesic distances, but as a drawback, the solution of an optimization
task (resp. Karcher equation in Riemannian case) which is in general highly nonlinear
and complex.

We have seen that p = q, if n = 1. Next, we exposit a brief comparison corresponding
to this fact, when the weighted geometric mean is replaced by the median argM in(F )
where F := (1− t)d(., pi) + td(., p1). Thus, suppose that d is convex. Fix x ∈ M . Let Bi
denote the ball with radius ri = d(x, pi) around pi and l := d(p0, p1). If ri > l for i = 1

10

or 0, then we have F (x) > l ≥ F (q) for any q ∈ [p0, p1]. Hence, x cannot be a minimizer.
Therefore, we may and do assume that ri ≤ l.
In view of the triangle inequality,
there is a point q ∈ [p0, p1] in the intersection of B0 and B1, i.e., d(x, pi) ≥ d(q, pi).
Thus, d(x, pi) ≥ d(q, pi) implying F (x) ≥ F (q) = F (Φs(p0, p1)) for some s ∈ I with
q = Φs(p0, p1), and we arrive at F (x) ≥ ((1 − t)s + t(1 − s))l. Therefore, F has a
minimizer in [p0, p1]. Indeed, d(x, .) is linearly increasing on [p0, p1
0(1/2)] and linearly
decreasing on [p0, p1

0(1/2)] for any x and we have (breakdown at t = 1/2)

Next, we assume that (M, d) is a smooth complete Riemannian manifold without
conjugate points and consider the characterization of geometric mean as the unique
solution of the corresponding Karcher equation. Note that, within the injectivity radius
of the Riemannian exponential map exp, in terms of local representatives, the aﬃne map
of (M, d) is given by

Φt(x, y) = expx(t logx(y))

where logx denotes the local inverse of the exponential map at x. We recall two important
well known special cases when for any control points the weighted geometric mean is
√
well deﬁned. First, if the sectional curvatures of M are bounded above by k > 0 and

k), second, Cartan-Hadamard manifolds like the space of positive
deﬁnite symmetric matrices. Many progresses concern the latter (for which there are
also recent extensions to the inﬁnite-dimensional setting presented in [16]). For further
applications as well as the proof (based on Jacobi ﬁeld estimates) of the correpsonding
Karcher’s result we refer to [1], [7], [6] and the pioneer work [17]. Some related results
on geometric median and extension of Weiszfeld algorithm for its computation, can be
found in [9].

In the following we suppose that M is contained in an open ball of radius less than
) of a Riemannian manifold with injectivity radius rinj and sectional cur-
:= ∞ if k ≤ 0. Then, due to [17], for any y ∈ M ,

We present for n = 1 an alternate direct proof of the fact that p(t) = p1
minimizer of (1 − t)d2(., p0) + td2(., p1) utilizing the Karcher equation

0(t) is the unique

i=0

(1 − t) logx p0 + t logx p1 = 0.

Denoting v := logp0 p1 (the initial velocity of the geodesic from p0 to p1), we have
logp(t) p0 = −tw(t) and logp(t) p1 = (1 − t)w(t) where w(t) denotes the parallel transport

11

of v along p at t. Therefore

(1 − t) logp(t) p0 + t logp(t) p1 = −(1 − t)tw(t) + t(1 − t)w(t) = 0.

Hence, the point p(t) is critical. With d2(., p0) and d2(., p1), the weighted sum (1 −
t)d2(., p0) + td2(., p1) is also strictly convex, implying that the critical point p(t) is its
unique minimizer.

˙q(0) = n logp0 p1,

at x0, yields IdTx0 M + (d log x0)(cid:12)(cid:12)x0

Proof. Smoothness of the centroid curve q is an application of the implicit function
theorem to the Karcher equation. To prove the formula for the velocities, let x0 ∈ M .
Taking the tangent maps of both sides of the identity exp(log x0) = x0 and evaluation
= −IdTx0 M where Tx0M
denotes the tangent space at x0 and 0x0 its zero, and we used the natural identiﬁcation
TvTx0M (cid:39) Tx0M for any v ∈ Tx0M . Now, by the Karcher equation

Reversing the order of the control points and replacing t by 1−t completes the proof.

The preceding result can be used for C 1 interpolation and path ﬁtting with centroid
curves. We remark that due to [24],
It
follows that p and q have the same tangents at their endpoints. Obviously, in Euclidean
spaces, the curves p and q coincide. In general geodesic spaces, they are equal, if n = 1.
In the next example we compare p and q for the spherical case and, as an application
of the Karcher equation, show that already for three control points, even the images of
those curves (although close) are diﬀerent.

˙p(0) = n logp0 p1 and ˙p(1) = −n logpn pn−1.

Example 5.2. Let p0, p1, p2 be vertices of an equilateral spherical triangle with the com-
mon length of the sides α ∈]0, π/2]. A straightforward calculation shows

p(1/2) =

where

Now, p(1/2) ∈ q(I) holds, if and only if there exists s ∈ I such that p(1/2) satisﬁes the

6 Conclusion

In this paper we extended the setting for de Casteljau algorithm as well as de Boor
algorithm to unique geodesic spaces and presented some examples. In turn, B´ezier and

13

more generally spline curves in these spaces can be constructed via iteration. Of course,
the main issue remains the fact that one needs to compute geodesics. We expect besides
Riemannian manifolds, applications of our results in other geodesic spaces including
trees and Bruhat-Titz buildings. Furthermore, we expect similar results concerning sub-
division schemes as well as the bivariate case to produce nets and spline surfaces in
geodesic spaces. Moreover, weighted extended B-splines (WEB-splines, [10] and [13])
can be combined with our approach to provide eﬃcient approximations with high accu-
racy for solutions of boundary value problems on manifolds. Moreover, considering the
Bernstein polynomials as weights for the cost function deﬁning the geometric mean, and
piecing them together, we get a diﬀerent approach to interpolation tasks and construc-
tion of splines. We proved that the B´ezier interpolation of the corresponding curves is
C 1. Further properties of the latter curves and their application in interpolation would
be desirable future tasks.
