We have examined local 3d electronic structures of Co-Au multinuclear complexes with medicinal
molecules d-penicillaminate (d-pen) [Co{Au(PPh3)(d-pen)}2]ClO4 and [Co3{Au3(tdme)(d-pen)3}2]
by means of Co L-edge soft X-ray absorption (XAS) spectroscopy, where PPh3 denotes triph-
enylphosphine and tdme stands for 1,1,1-tris[(diphenylphosphino)methyl]ethane. The Co L-edge
XAS spectra indicates the localized ionic 3d electronic states in both materials. The experimental
spectra are well explained by spectral simulation for a localized Co ion under ligand ﬁelds with
the full multiplet theory, which veriﬁes that the ions are in the low-spin Co3+ state in the former
compound and in the high-spin Co2+ state in the latter.

INTRODUCTION

The electronic structure of a transition metal ion in
materials is important for their functions not only in
various inorganic crystalline solids but also in complex
with organic molecules as seen in hemoglobin. Actu-
ally, many transition metal complexes with such inter-
esting natures as spin crossover1–3 and mixed valence4
have been synthesized. Meanwhile, d-penicillaminate
(d-pen) is employed as a heavy metal antagonist5–7
since it has a nature of building metal coordination sys-
tems. Such a aminothiolate would also be a candidate
of raw materials for newly functional metal multinu-
clear coordination systems. So far, many metal com-
plexes with d-pen have been thus developed4,8,9. Among
them, it has been reported that the Co2+ ions in single-
crystalline [Co3{Au3(tdme)(d-pen)3}2] (tdme denotes
1,1,1-tris[(diphenylphosphino)methyl]ethane) are unusu-
ally stabilized in an octahedral coordination environment
surrounded by two aliphatic thiolato, two amine, and two
carboxylate donors10, as shown in Fig. 1. On the other
hand, the Co ions in another Co-Au trinuclear complex
[Co{Au(PPh3)(d-pen)}2]ClO4 (PPh3 stands for triph-
enylphosphine) have been reported as in the Co3+ state
although the local coordination environment is similar to
that in [Co3{Au3(tdme)(d-pen)3}2] except for their bond
length11, as shown in Fig.1. The valence and spin states
of the Co ions in these crystals have been estimated from
their crystal color, magnetic susceptibility, and light ab-
sorption in visible and UV region10,11. However, direct
veriﬁcations by using an element-speciﬁc probe are still
lacking.

In the high-energy spectroscopic ﬁeld, K-edge X-ray
absorption ﬁne structure (XAFS) has been applied to
transition metal complexes12–14, where possible deterio-

ration of measured samples caused by irradiation have
not been so serious. However, it is diﬃcult to obtain the
local 3d electronic structure by XAFS as well as K-edge
X-ray absorption near-eadge structure (XANES) due to
the s-to-p excitation process. On the other hand, L2,3-
edge soft X-ray absorption (XAS) spectroscopy is pow-
erful for directly probing the local element-speciﬁc elec-
tronic structure15–21. However, the application of L-edge
XAS to transition metal complexes is still new frontier
because sample degradations caused by soft X-ray irradi-
ations have often prevented us from acquisitions of reli-
able spectra22,23. This technical diﬃculties are solved by
optimizing photon density and properly changing sample
position.

In this paper, we report on the local 3d elec-
tronic structures of the Co-Au multinuclear complexes
[Co{Au(PPh3)(d-pen)}2]ClO4 and [Co3{Au3(tdme)(d-
pen)3}2] investigated by the Co L-edge soft X-ray XAS.
It has been veriﬁed that the Co ions are in the low-spin
(LS) Co3+ state for the former compound whereas they
are in the high-spin (HS) Co2+ state for the latter sys-
tem on the basis of the comparisons of the experimental
spectra with spectral simulations for a localized ion un-
der the crystalline electronic ﬁelds (CEF) with taking the
full multiplet theory into account.

II. EXPERIMENTAL

The XAS measurements were carried out at BL-11
of Synchrotron Radiation Center in Ritsumeikan Uni-
versity, Japan.
In this beamline, so-called varied-
line-spacing plane gratings were employed, supplying
monochromatic photons with hν = 40−1000 eV. The Co
L2,3-edge XAS spectra (hν = 760−810 eV) were taken

The experimental geometry is shown in the Fig. 2(a). In
the PFY mode, a large-area silicon drift detector cap-
turing photon energy-dependent luminescence was set to
45◦ with respect to the photon propagation in the xy
plane. For the Co L2,3-edge XAS measurements, the lu-
minescence with hν : 700 − 950 eV including the Co L
lines was detected as a signal. On the other hand, in
the PEY mode, the micro channel plate (MCP) detect-
ing the Auger and secondary electrons was set in the
45◦-depression to the photon propagation. In the front
of MCP, a gold mesh was installed to be able to apply a
voltage. We applied the voltage of −550 V to the mesh
for the Co L-edge measurements in order to suppress a
strong background caused by the C, N and O K-edge
absorptions in the spectra.

bon tape attached on the sample holder in air before
transferring them into the vacuum chamber. Since the
single-crystal sizes of every piece were smaller than
∼100 µm, neither cleaving (fracturing) nor scraping
of the samples in situ for obtaining the clean surfaces
was feasible for the XAS measurements. However, we
believe that the intrinsic XAS spectra of these samples
have been obtained as discussed later probably due to
the stability of the ionized Co states in the compounds,
in which the Co ions have already been “oxidized” in
a chemical sense. We repeatedly measured the spectra
on the same and diﬀerent sample positions, conﬁrming
the data reproducibility with neither serious radiation
damage nor sample-position dependence of the Co L2,3-
edge XAS spectra. The measurements were performed
at room temperature.

those reported for CoO (HS-Co2+:blue solid line), Sr2CoO3Cl

spin-orbit coupling in all spectra. The overall spectral
features are mutually consistent among these three
spectra without showing a serious peak shift, indicating
that we have successfully obtained the intrinsic XAS
spectra. On the other hand, there are some detailed
discrepancies among the spectra. A shoulder structure at
hν = 779 eV in the spectra in the TEY and PEY modes
is markedly suppressed in the PFY spectrum. On the
basis of the probing depth of each mode16, we can judge
that this shoulder would be due to a surface contribution
deviated from the bulk ones. Between the two main
L2,3-edge peaks, another shoulder is seen at hν = 782
eV in both TEY and PEY spectra, being overlapped
with an asymmetric tail in the PFY spectrum. Such an
asymmetric tail is also seen on the high-hν side of the L2
edge in the PFY spectrum. These tails would originate
from so-called self-absorption eﬀects16,24,25, by which the
spectral shape can be deviated from the intrinsic one.
In addition, a background of the spectrum in the TEY
mode depend on hν, where it is stronger for low-hν side

3

than those for high-hν side. This fact suggests that the
intrinsic Co L2,3-edge XAS spectral weight is remarkably
weaker than the background yielded by high-energy tails
of the C, N, O K-edge absorptions caused by a tiny
Co element ratio as C : N : O : Co = 46 : 2 : 8 : 1
for [Co{Au(PPh3)(D-pen)}2]ClO4.
In the PEY mode,
on the other hand, the background is relatively weaker
than the Co L2,3-edge XAS spectral weight owing to the
suppression of the contribution of electrons with their
kinetic energy less than 550 eV to the spectral intensity.
This background increases slightly and linearly with hν,
as shown in Fig.2(b). Therefore, we have concluded that
the spectrum in the PEY mode is the most reliable for
the quantitative discussions shown below although it is
relatively surface-sensitive.

The
and
spectra
[Co3{Au3(tdme)(d-pen)3}2]
in the PEY mode are
shown in Fig.3. The characteristic spectral structures
from the bulk nature are labelled as A-D and a-f in
spectra, respectively. A metal-like asymmetric tail of the
L3 main peak16,26 is not seen at all. A possible satellite
structure in the photon energy of 5 − 6 eV higher than
the main peaks called as a charge-transfer satellite is
negligible. Such a satellite originates from hybridizations
between the Co 3d and ligands p orbitals described by
conﬁguration interactions on the basis of the cluster
model27,28 or Anderson impurity model29. Therefore,
the absence of the satellite suggests that these spectra
can be well explained by local
ion models without
explicitly considering the hybridization eﬀects. Let us
compare our spectra with those reported for inorganic Co
compounds EuCoO3 (pure LS-Co3+), Sr2CoO3Cl (pure
HS-Co3+), and CoO (pure HS-Co2+)30–32 indicated in
Fig.3, where the characteristic spectral structures are
also labelled as A’-D’, a’-f’, and α, respectively. The
spectral features of [Co{Au(PPh3)(d-pen)}2]ClO4 are
inconsistent with those of Sr2CoO3Cl near the L2 edge,
while the structures A-D seem to correspond well with
those A’-D’ for EuCoO3. Therefore, it is concluded that
the Co ions of [Co{Au(PPh3)(d-pen)}2]ClO4 are in the
LS-Co3+ state. On the other hand, the structures a-d in
the spectrum of [Co3{Au3(tdme)(d-pen)3}2] are similar
to those a’-d’ in the spectrum of CoO at the L3 edge
although they are somehow smeared. The spectral shape
of [Co3{Au3(tdme)(d-pen)3}2] at the L2 edge seems to
be rather diﬀerent from that of CoO, but the L3-L2
splitting energy is mutually consistent. We can thus
judge that the Co ions in [Co3{Au3(tdme)(d-pen)3}2]
are in the HS-Co2+ state. We consider that a shoulder
structure at hν = 779 eV in the spectrum of the
[Co{Au(PPh3)(d-pen)}2]ClO4 is caused by the surface
Co2+ contribution corresponding to the peak b for
[Co3{Au3(tdme)(d-pen)3}2], where the Co2+ state is
favored in the surface due to its larger ionic radius than
that for the Co3+ state.
As mentioned before,

[Co{Au(PPh3)(d-pen)}2]ClO4
and [Co3{Au3(tdme)(d-pen)3}2] have the octahedral co-

ordination environment. In addition, the average of the
bond lengths of [Co{Au(PPh3)(d-pen)}2]ClO4 (2.03 )
and [Co3{Au3(tdme)(d-pen)3}2] (2.25 ) estimated by X-
ray diﬀraction are longer than those of EuCoO3 (1.93 )
and CoO (2.10 )33,34, which might allow to discuss the
Co L2,3-edge XAS spectral shape in view of the localized
Co ions under CEF. We have performed spectral simu-
lations for the Co ion35,36 in cubic Oh symmetry using
the XTLS 9.0 program37. All atomic parameters such as
the 3d-3d and 2p-3d coulomb and exchange interactions
(Slater integrals), and the 2p and 3d spin-orbit couplings
have been obtained using Cowan’s code38 based on the
Hartree-Fock method. The Slater integrals were reduced
to 80%20,39 to reproduce the Co L2,3-edge XAS spectra,
as shown in Table I. The actual local symmetry of the
Co ions is lower than the cubic ones for both materials.
However, the CEF splitting 10Dq between the t2g and
eg states in the Oh symmetry is crucial for determining
the local spin state (HS or LS) of the Co ions. There-
fore, the simulations in the Oh symmetry would give the
meaningful information of the 3d electronic states. The
simulation results for Co3+ and Co2+ as a function of
10Dq in the Oh symmetry is shown in Fig. 4, being con-
sistent with previous calculation results36. The feature
A”-D” and a”-f” denote the characteristic structures for
the Co ions, respectively. For the spectra of Co3+, the
shoulder structure B” (D”) is reduced and shifted to the
higher photon energy with increasing 10Dq. As well as
the feature of B” and D”, the structure c” (f”) is shifted
to the higher photon energy in the spectra of Co2+. On
the contrary, the structure a” is shifted to the low-hν side
with increasing 10Dq.

Our results show that the energy diﬀerence be-

[Co3{Au3(tdme)(d-pen)3}2]. These 10Dq values lead to

ity and the optical absorption results. Detailed quan-
titative inconsistency of the line shape at the L3 edge
between [Co3{Au3(tdme)(d-pen)3}2] and the HS-Co2+
state might be caused by the diﬀerence in symmetry.

Note that our optimized 10Dq value of 3.0 eV for
the LS-Co3+ states is much (more than 3 times) larger
31 since our value corresponds to
than that for EuCoO3
a renormalized 10Dq in which the hybridization eﬀects
(anisotropy in the hybridization in a rigorous sense) are
implicitly included. This is higher than the value of the
LS-HS crossover ≈2.2 eV39. The estimated 10Dq of 1.0
eV for the HS-Co2+ state is expected to be much smaller
than that of the LS-HS crossover for Co2+ (∼2.0-2.5 eV).
Such a small 10Dq value might unusually stabilize the
Co2+ state in [Co3{Au3(tdme)(d-pen)3}2]. When we
consider the fact that the Co3+ ions have the smaller ionic
radius than that for the Co2+ ions in these compounds,
the larger 10Dq in [Co{Au(PPh3)(d-pen)}2]ClO4 is un-
derstood as a consequence of the strong hybridization
caused by the shorter distance between the Co and neigh-
boring ions.

which are consistent with the magnetic susceptibility
