Abstract

Recently it was demonstrated that Sr intercalation provides a new route to induce supercon-

ductivity in the topological insulator Bi2Se3. Topological superconductors are predicted to be

unconventional, with mixed even and odd parity Cooper pairs states. An adequate probe to test

for unconventional superconductivity is the upper critical ﬁeld, Bc2. For a standard BCS layered

superconductor Bc2 shows an anisotropy when the magnetic ﬁeld is applied parallel and perpen-

dicular to the layers, but is isotropic when the ﬁeld is rotated in the plane of the layers. Here we

report measurements of the upper critical ﬁeld of superconducting SrxBi2Se3 crystals (Tc = 3.0 K).

Surprisingly, ﬁeld-angle dependent magnetotransport measurements reveal a large anisotropy of

Bc2 when the magnet ﬁeld is rotated in the basal plane. The large two-fold anisotropy, while

six-fold is anticipated, cannot be explained with the Ginzburg-Landau anisotropic eﬀective mass

model or ﬂux ﬂow induced by the Lorentz force. The rotational symmetry breaking of Bc2 in-

dicates unconventional superconductivity with an odd-parity polarized triplet Cooper pair state

(∆4-pairing) recently proposed for rhombohedral topological superconductors, or might have a

structural nature, such as self-organized stripe ordering of Sr atoms.

Currently, topological insulators (TIs) are at the focus of condensed matter research, be-

cause they oﬀer unprecedented possibilities to study novel quantum states [1–3]. 3D TIs are

bulk insulators with a non-trivial topology of the electron bands that gives rise to surface

states at the edge of the material. The gapless surface states have a Dirac-type energy dis-

persion with the spin locked to the momentum and are protected by symmetry. This makes

TIs promising materials for applications in ﬁelds like spintronics and magnetoelectrics [1, 2].

The concept of a TI can also be applied to superconductors (SCs), where the superconduct-

ing gap corresponds to the gap of the band insulator [4, 5]. Topological superconductors are

predicted to be unconventional, with a mixed even and odd parity Cooper pair state [6, 7].

Much research eﬀorts are devoted to 1D and 2D SCs, where Majorana zero modes exist as

protected states at the edge of the SC [8, 9]. Majorana zero modes with their non-Abelian

statistics oﬀer a unique platform for future topological quantum computation devices [10].

Prominent candidates for 3D topological SC are the Cu intercalated TI Bi2Se3 [11, 12], the

doped topological crystalline insulator Sn1−xInxTe [13] and selected topological half-Heusler

compounds [14–16].

Among the 3D topological superconductors, CuxBi2Se3, which has a SC transition tem-

perature Tc = 3 K for x = 0.3 [11, 12], is the most intensively studied material. ARPES

(Angle Resolved PhotoEmission Spectroscopy) experiments conducted to study the bulk and

surface states reveal that the topological character is preserved when Bi2Se3 is intercalated

with Cu [17]. By evaluating the topological invariants of the Fermi surface, CuxBi2Se3 is

expected to be a time-reversal invariant fully-gapped odd-parity topological SC [6, 7]. This

was put on a ﬁrmer footing by a two-orbital pairing potential model where odd-parity SC

is favoured by strong spin-orbit coupling [18]. Several experiments have been interpreted in

line with topological SC. The speciﬁc heat shows a full SC gap [12]. The upper critical ﬁeld

exceeds the Pauli limit and has a temperature variation that points to spin-triplet SC [19].

Much excitement was generated by the observation of a zero-bias conductance peak in point

contact spectroscopy, that was attributed to a Majorana surface state [20]. However, STS

(Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy) showed that the density of states at the Fermi level

is fully gapped without any in-gap states [21]. On the other hand, the superconducting

state shows a large inhomogeneity [21] and the superconducting volume fraction depends on

quenching conditions [22]. Consequently, the issue of topological SC in CuxBi2Se3 has not

been settled and further experiments are required, as well as new materials.

2

Very recently it has been demonstrated that Sr intercalation provides a new route to

induce superconductivity in Bi2Se3 [23]. Resistivity and magnetization measurements on

SrxBi2Se3 single crystals with x = 0.06 show Tc = 2.5 K. The SC volume fraction amounts to

90 % which conﬁrms bulk SC. By optimizing the Sr content a maximum Tc of 2.9 K was found

for x = 0.10 [24]. The topological character of Bi2Se3 is preserved upon Sr intercalation.

ARPES showed a topological surface state well separated from the bulk conduction band [25,

26]. Based on the ﬁrst measurements of the electronic parameters in the normal and SC

states, and the close analogy to CuxBi2Se3, it has been advocated that SrxBi2Se3 is a new

laboratory tool to investigate topological SC [23, 24].

Here we report a study of unusual basal-plane anisotropy eﬀects in the upper critical ﬁeld,

Bc2, of SrxBi2Se3. Bi2Se3 crystallizes in a rhombohedral structure with space group R3m.

It is a layered material and Sr is intercalated in the Van der Waals gaps between the quin-

tuple Bi2Se3 layers [23]. For a standard BCS (Bardeen, Cooper, Schrieﬀer) layered SC the
anisotropy of Bc2 is expressed by the parameter γan = Bk

c2, where Bk

c2/B⊥

c2 and B⊥

c2 are mea-

sured with the B-ﬁeld parallel and perpendicular to the layers, respectively [27]. Whereas
Bk

c2 is normally isotropic, SrxBi2Se3 presents a unique exception. Field-angle-dependent

with Ba

magnetotransport experiments demonstrate a large two-fold basal-plane anisotropy of Bc2,
c2 = 2.3 T for x = 0.15 at T /Tc = 0.1 (Tc = 3.0 K), where a and a∗
are orthogonal directions in the basal plane. This large eﬀect cannot be explained with the

c2 = 7.4 T and Ba∗

anisotropic eﬀective mass model [27, 28] or the variation of Bc2 caused by ﬂux ﬂow [29]. The

rotational symmetry breaking of Bc2 indicates unconventional superconductivity [30, 31], or

might have a structural nature, such as preferential ordering of Sr atoms.

Results

The resistivity, ρ(T ), of our SrxBi2Se3 crystals with x = 0.10 and x = 0.15 shows a metallic

temperature variation with superconducting transition temperatures Tc of 2.8 K and 3.0 K,

respectively, see Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Information [32]. The SC volume fractions

of the crystals measured by ac-susceptibility amount to 40 % and 80 %, respectively [32].

In Fig. 1 we show the angular variation of the resistance, R(θ), measured in a ﬁxed ﬁeld

B = 0.4 T directed in the basal plane (aa∗-plane), in the temperature range 2-3 K around

Tc (Tc = 2.8 K at B = 0 T), for x = 0.10. Rather than attaining a constant value, the

curves show a pronounced angular variation which demonstrates that Bc2(T ) (or Tc(B)) is

3

ﬁeld-angle dependent. For instance, at 2.5 K and 0.4 T (violet symbols) the sample is in

the normal state at θ = 3◦ and superconducts (R = 0) at 93◦. By raising the temperature

from 2 K to 3 K SC is smoothly depressed for all ﬁeld directions. The data show a striking

two-fold symmetry, which is most clearly demonstrated in a polar plot (Figure 2). We

remark, the same two-fold anisotropy is observed in crystals with x = 0.15. In the top panel

of Fig. 1 we show R(θ) in the normal state measured in 8 T for x = 0.10. The data have

been symmetrized after measuring R(θ) for opposite ﬁeld polarities to eliminate a small Hall

component. R(θ) in the normal state shows the same two-fold symmetry as in Fig. 1a. The

variation in R(θ) is small and amounts to 3 % in 8 T. The data follow a sin θ dependence,

which tells us the variation is due to the classical magnetoresistance related to the Lorentz

force FL = BI sin θ, where I is the transport current that ﬂows in the basal plane. R(θ) is

minimum in the longitudinal case (B k I) and maximum in the transverse case (B ⊥ I).

In Fig. 3 we report Bc2(T ) for two single crystals measured with the B-ﬁeld along the

orthogonal directions in the hexagonal unit cell. The data points are obtained by measuring

the superconducting transition in R(T ) in ﬁxed ﬁelds, where Tc is identiﬁed by the 50 %

drop of R with respect to its value in the normal state [32]. In determining the values of Bc2

we did not correct for demagnetization eﬀects, since the demagnetization factors calculated

for our crystals are small [32]. As expected from the data in Fig. 1, we observe a large

diﬀerence between Ba

c2 , with an in-plane anisotropy parameter γan

c2 of
6.8 (at 1.9 K) and 2.6 (at 0.3 K) for x = 0.10 and x = 0.15, respectively. For both crystals
c2. Obviously, the Bc2 ratio γan for the ﬁeld k and ⊥ to the layers depends on
the ﬁeld angle and ranges from 1.2 to 3.2 for x = 0.15. In Ref. 24 a value for γan of 1.5 is

Ba∗

c2 ≈ Bc

reported, whereas from the data in Ref. 23 we infer a value of 1. In the top panels of Fig. 3

we show ρ(B) measured along the a, a∗ and c axis at T = 2.0 K and T = 0.3 K for x = 0.10

and x = 0.15, respectively. The Bc2(T ) values are determined by the midpoints of the

transitions to the normal state, and are indicated by open symbols in the lower panels. The

agreement between both methods (ﬁeld sweeps and temperature sweeps) is excellent. For

the x = 0.15 sample we see a remarkable broadening for B k a. The initial small increase of

ρ(B) between 4 and 6 T is most likely related to a sample inhomogeneity, because a similar

tail is also observed in the R(T ) data [32].

In Fig. 4 we show the angular variation of the upper critical ﬁeld, Bc2(θ). For this

experiment the crystals are placed on the rotator and the ﬁeld is oriented in the basal plane.

4

The data points are obtained as the midpoints of the transitions to the normal state of the

R(B) curves measured at temperatures of 2 K for x = 0.10 and of 0.3 K and 2 K for x = 0.15

(see Fig. S7 [32]). All data sets show the pronounced two-fold basal-plane anisotropy of Bc2,

already inferred from Figs. 1 and 2.

Discussion

Having conclusively established the two-fold anisotropy of Bc2 in the basal plane, we now

turn to possible explanations. A ﬁrst explanation could be a lowering of the symmetry caused

by a crystallographic phase transition below room temperature. However, the powder X-ray

diﬀraction patterns measured at room temperature and T = 10 K are identical (see Fig. S2

in Ref. 32). Moreover, the resistivity traces (T = 2 − 300 K, Fig. S8) and the speciﬁc heat

(T = 2 − 200 K, Fig. S6) all show a smooth variation with temperature and do not show

any sign of a structural phase transition [32]. We therefore argue our crystals keep the R3m

space group at low temperatures.

A second explanation for breaking the symmetry in the basal plane could be the measuring

current itself. Since the current ﬂows in the basal plane it naturally breaks the symmetry

when we rotate the ﬁeld in the basal-plane. Indeed Bc2 is largest for B k I and smallest

for B ⊥ I. In the latter geometry, and for large current densities, the Lorentz force may

cause ﬂux lines to detach from the pinning centers, which will lead to a ﬁnite resistance,

a broadened R(B)-curve and a lower value of Bc2 [29]. This eﬀect has been observed for

instance in the hexagonal superconductor MgB2 by rotating B with respect to I in the basal

plane [33]. For a current density 30 A/cm2, the two-fold anisotropy obtained just below

Tc = 36 K is small, ∼ 8 % [33].

In our transport experiments the current densities are

≤ 0.4 A/cm2 and we did not detect a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the resistance when the current

density was varied close to Tc (see Fig. S9 [32]). Also, when ﬂux ﬂow has a signiﬁcant

contribution, one expects the R(B)-curves for B ⊥ I to be broader than the curves for

B k I. However, we observe the reverse (see Figs 3a,b). Moreover, the anisotropy is still

present at T /Tc = 0.1 and is much larger (of the order of 300 %, see Fig. 4) than can

be expected on the basis of ﬂux ﬂow.

In order to further rule out the inﬂuence of the

current direction we have investigated Bc2(θ) in the basal plane with the transport current

perpendicular to the layers (I k c) and thus keeping B ⊥ I (see Fig. S11, Ref. 32). The

angular variation of the resistance, measured in this geometry using a two-probe method,

5

is similar to that reported in Fig. 1. Thus the two-fold anisotropy in Bc2 is also present for

the B-ﬁeld in the aa∗-plane and the current along the c-axis.

Next we address whether the variation of Bc2 in the basal plane can be attributed to the

anisotropy of the eﬀective mass. Within the Ginzburg-Landau model [27, 34] the anisotropy

of Bc2 is attributed to the anisotropy of the SC coherence length, ξ, which in turn relates to

the anisotropy of the eﬀective mass. For a layered superconductor the anisotropy ratio γan =
Bk
c2 = pM/m [28]. Here m and M are the eﬀective masses k and ⊥ to the layers. In the
rhombohedral structure m = ma = ma∗ and M = mc, where the subscripts a, a∗ and c refer

c2/B⊥

to the eﬀective masses for the energy dispersion along the main orthogonal crystal axes (i.e.
in the hexagonal unit cell). For a ﬁeld rotation in the aa∗-plane Bk

c2 is in general isotropic,

since ma ≈ ma∗(< mc). For a 3D anisotropic superconductor the angular variation Bc2(θ) in
a principal crystal plane can be expressed as Bc2(θ) = Bc2(0◦)/(cos2 θ + γ−2 sin2 θ)1/2, where
γ = Bc2(90◦)/Bc2(0◦). To provide an estimate of γ for Sr0.15Bi2Se3, we compare in Fig. 4b

the measured Bc2(θ) with the angular variation in the anisotropic eﬀective mass model (solid
line). We obtain Bc2(0◦) = 2.3 T, Bc2(90◦) = 7.4 T and γ = 3.2. The eﬀective mass ratio

ma∗/ma = γ2 [34] would then attain the large value of 10.2. As we show below, this is not

compatible with the experimental Fermi-surface determination.

The Fermi surface of n-doped Bi2Se3, with a typical carrier concentration n ∼ 2 ×

1019 cm−3 representative for the SC SrxBi2Se3 crystals [23, 24], has been investigated by the

Shubnikov - de Haas eﬀect [23, 35, 36]. It can be approximated by an ellipsoid of revolution

with the longer axis along the kc-axis. A trigonal warping of the Fermi surface due to the

rhombohedral symmetry has been detected, but the eﬀect is small: the variation of the

eﬀective mass in the basal plane amounts to a few % only [35]. This also explains why R(θ)

in the normal state (Fig. 1a), does not show a 2π/3 periodicity superimposed on the two-

fold symmetry induced by the current. Clearly, the two-fold symmetry (Fig. 4), while three

fold is expected, and the calculated large ratio ma∗/ma using the Ginzburg-Landau model

are at variance with the experimental Fermi-surface determination [35] and we discard this

scenario.

We remark that the overall temperature variation Bc2(T ) reported in Fig. 3d is at variance

with the standard BCS behaviour for a weak-coupling spin-singlet SC [37]. All the curves

show an upward curvature below Tc, followed by a quasi-linear behaviour down to the

lowest temperatures. Furthermore, for B k a, Bc2(T → 0) largely exceeds the Pauli limit

6

BP (T → 0) = 1.86 × Tc ≈ 5.6 T for a spin-singlet SC [38]. This may point to an odd-parity

component in the SC order parameter. Nagai (Ref. 30) and Fu (Ref. 31) recently proposed

a model for odd parity polarized spin-triplet SC developed in the context of CuxBi2Se3, and

investigated the experimental consequences of ∆4 pairing in the two-orbital model [18]. Here,

SC is described by an odd-parity two-dimensional representation, Eu, where the attractive

potential pairs two electrons in the unit cell to form a spin triplet, i.e. a linear combination

of c1↑c2↑ and c1↓c2↓. The indices 1,2 refer to the two orbitals and the arrows to the spin. The

∆4 state has zero-total spin along an in-plane direction n = (nx, ny) that is regarded as a

nematic director and breaks rotational symmetry. By taking into account the full crystalline

anisotropy in the Ginzburg-Landau model, it can be shown that n is pinned to a direction

in the basal plane. For n = ˆx, point nodes in the SC gap are found along ˆy, whereas for

n = ˆy two gap minima occur at ±kF ˆx [31]. Our Bc2-data can be interpreted as reﬂecting a

strongly anisotropic SC gap function. The SC coherence length, ξ, along the main axes can

be evaluated from the Ginzburg-Landau relations Ba

c2 = Φ0/(2πξa∗ξc), Ba∗

c2 = Φ0/(2πξaξc)

and Bc

c2 = Φ0/(2πξaξa∗). Here Φ0 is the ﬂux quantum. With the experimental Bc2-values,

taken at T /Tc = 0.1 in Fig. 3d for x = 0.15, we calculate ξa = 19.6 nm, ξa∗ = 7.6 nm and

ξc = 5.4 nm. Interpreting ξ as the Cooper-pair size, this implies that the pairing interaction

is strongest along the a∗ and c-axis, and weakest along the a-axis. The observation that

ξa > ξa∗ ≈ ξc, is in agreement with a gap structure with n = ˆy. On the other hand, in the

∆4 pairing model rotational symmetry breaking due to nematic order is a property of the

SC state, while Bc2 probes the transition to the normal state and therefore should retain the

hexagonal symmetry of the crystal lattice [39, 40]. This indicates a more intricate scenario.

We remark that rotational symmetry breaking in the spin system has been observed by

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) in the related superconductor CuxBi2Se3, which is

considered to provide solid evidence for a spin-triplet state [41].

Yet another interesting possibility is a self-organized structural stripiness in the optimum

for superconductivity due to ordering of Sr atoms in the Van der Waals gaps. This could

naturally lead to an anisotropy of Bc2 when measured for a current in the basal plane,

because of an eﬀective reduced dimensionality. The higher Bc2-values will then be found for

B k I along the stripes. On the other hand, for I perpendicular to the layers the basal-

plane anisotropy of Bc2 is found as well [32]. This calls for a detailed compositional and

structural characterization of SrxBi2Se3 by techniques such as Electron Probe Microprobe

7

Analysis (EPMA) or Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Notice that in CuxBi2Se3

crystals EPMA has revealed that the Cu concentration shows variations on the sub-mm

scale, which gives rise to SC islands [42]. Moreover, a STM study reports an oscillatory

behaviour of the Cu pair distribution function due to screened Coulomb repulsion of the

intercalant atoms [43].

In conclusion, we have investigated the angular variation of the upper critical ﬁeld of su-

perconducting crystals of SrxBi2Se3. The measurements reveal a striking two-fold anisotropy

of the basal-plane Bc2. The large anisotropy cannot be explained with the anisotropic ef-

fective mass model or the variation of Bc2 caused by ﬂux ﬂow. We have addressed two

alternative explanations: (i) unconventional superconductivity, with an odd-parity triplet

Cooper-pair state (∆4 pairing), and (ii) self-organized striped superconductivity due to pref-

erential ordering of Sr atoms. The present experiments and results provide an important

benchmark for further unravelling the superconducting properties of the new candidate

topological superconductor SrxBi2Se3.

Methods

Sample preparation. Single crystals SrxBi2Se3 with x = 0.10 and x = 0.15 were prepared

by melting high-purity elements at 850 ◦C in sealed evacuated quartz tubes, followed by

slowly cooling till 650 ◦C at the rate of 3 ◦C/hour. Powder X-ray diﬀraction conﬁrms the

R3m space group (see Supplementary Information [32]). Laue back-scattering diﬀraction

conﬁrmed the single-crystallinity and served to identify the crystal axes a and a∗. Thin

bar-like samples with typical dimensions 0.3 × 1.5 × 3 mm3 were cut from the bulk crystal

for the transport measurements.

Magnetotransport experiment. Magnetotransport experiments were carried out in a

PPMS-Dynacool (Quantum Design) in the temperature range from 2 K to 300 K and mag-

netic ﬁelds up to 9 T and in a 3-Helium cryostat (Heliox, Oxford Instruments) down to

0.3 K and ﬁelds up to 12 T. The resistance was measured with a low-frequency ac-technique

in a 4-point conﬁguration with small excitation currents, I, to prevent Joule heating (I =

0.5-1 mA in the PPMS and 100 µA in the Heliox experiments). The current was applied

in the basal plane along the long direction of the sample. For in-situ measurements of the

angular magnetoresistance the crystals were mounted on a mechanical rotator in the PPMS

8

and a piezocrystal-based rotator (Attocube) in the Heliox. The samples were mounted such

that the rotation angle θ ≃ 0◦ corresponds to B ⊥ I. Care was taken to align the a-axis

with the current direction, but a misorientation of several degrees can not be excluded.

FIG. 1. Angular variation of the resistance of Sr0.10Bi2Se3. Lower panel: Resistance of

Sr0.10Bi2Se3 as a function of angle θ at B = 0.4 T and temperatures between 2.0 K (bottom)

and 3.0 K (top). The angle θ = 3◦ corresponds to B ⊥ I and θ = 93◦ to B k I as indicated by

arrows. The current direction is along the a-axis, with a precision of several degrees. The data are

measured with increasing angle, and reproduce when the rotation direction is reversed, apart from

a small backlash in the rotator of 2◦. Upper panel: R(θ) in the normal state at T = 3.0 K and

B = 8 T. The solid line shows R(θ) can be described by a sin θ function.

FIG. 3. Upper critical ﬁeld of SrxBi2Se3. Panel (a) and (b): Resistance of SrxBi2Se3 as a

function of B k a, a∗ and c, for x = 0.10 and 0.15, respectively. The open symbols indicate the

midpoints of the transitions to the normal state. Panel (c) and (d): Bc2 obtained for B k a, a∗ and

c, for x = 0.10 and 0.15, respectively. Solid symbols from midpoints of R(T )-curves in ﬁxed B [32].

Open symbols from ρ(B) at ﬁxed T . In the experiments for x = 0.15 the crystal was not mounted

on the rotator but oriented by eye, which adds some inaccuracy as regards ﬁeld alignment. The

current direction was always along the a-axis, with a precision of several degrees.

FIG. 4. Angular variation of Bc2 of SrxBi2Se3 in the basal plane. Panel (a) and (b):

Angular variation of Bc2 in the basal plane (aa∗-plane) for x = 0.10 and 0.15, respectively, at

temperatures as indicated. The data are obtained from R(B) measurements at ﬁxed T . The angle

θ = 0◦ corresponds to B k a∗ ⊥ I and θ = 90◦ to B k a k I. The solid black line in panel (b)

represents Bc2(θ) for an anisotropic eﬀective mass model with two-fold symmetry and γ = 3.2 (see

text). The a and a∗ directions in the hexagonal basal plane are deﬁned as in the ﬁgure in the upper

right corner of panel (b).
