We study a dynamic version of the Unruh eﬀect in a two dimensional collapse model forming
a black hole. In this two-dimensional collapse model a scalar ﬁeld coupled to the dilaton gravity,
moving leftwards, collapses to form a black hole. There are two sets of asymptotic (t → ∞)
observers, around x → ∞ and x → −∞. The observers at the right null inﬁnity witness a thermal
ﬂux of radiation associated with time dependent geometry leading to a black hole formation and its
subsequent Hawking evaporation, in an expected manner. We show that even the observers at left
null inﬁnity witness a thermal radiation, without experiencing any change of spacetime geometry all
along their trajectories. They remain geodesic observers in a ﬂat region of spacetime. Thus these
observers measure a late time thermal radiation, with exactly the same temperature as measured
by the observers at right null inﬁnity, despite moving geodesically in ﬂat spacetime throughout their
trajectories. However such radiation, as usual in the case of Unruh eﬀect, has zero ﬂux, unlike the
Hawking radiation seen by the observers at right null inﬁnity. We highlight the conceptual similarity
of this phenomenon with the standard Unruh eﬀect in ﬂat spacetime.

INTRODUCTION

Hawking radiation from a black hole [1–10] and the Un-
ruh radiation [3, 6–8, 11, 12] in the Rindler frame have
very similar mathematical properties. In the context of
an eternal black hole, the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state
of a quantum ﬁeld leads to a thermal density matrix for
static observers in the right wedge. This arises because
the modes of the quantum ﬁeld in the region inacces-
sible to the observer are traced out. Similarly, a uni-
formly accelerated observer in the right wedge of the ﬂat
spacetime will describe her observations using a thermal
density matrix, obtained by tracing out the modes inac-
cessible to her (on the left wedge) when the ﬁeld is in
the global, inertial, vacuum state. Both situations are
time-reversal invariant; while the relevant observers see
an ambient thermal radiation, they do not associate a
ﬂux of particles with this radiation.

A somewhat diﬀerent situation arises in the case of a
black hole formed by collapsing matter, with the quan-
tum state being the Unruh vacuum [In-vacuum] at very
early times. In this case, at late times, observers far away
from the collapsing body detect a ﬂux of particles with a
spectrum which is thermally populated. The energy car-
ried away by the particles is ultimately obtained from the
mass of the collapsing body and this leads to the concept
of black hole evaporation. The mathematical description
of this process takes into account; (i) the change in geom-
etry due to the collapse process and (ii) the formation of
event horizon leading to inaccessibility of a region from
future asymptotic observers. With future applications in

mind, let us brieﬂy recall the key concepts.

In standard 3+1 dimensional collapse, in which clas-
sical matter collapses to form a black hole, an apparent
horizon is formed, which grows and — at a certain stage
— an event horizon is formed thereby producing a black
hole region. The last null ray originating from the past
null inﬁnity J − at the null co-ordinate u = d, in the
double null co-ordinate system [1, 3, 6–8], reaching future
null inﬁnity J + deﬁnes the location of the event horizon.
An asymptotic observer on J + has no causal connection
with events inside the event horizon. Further, whole of
J + derives its complete causal support (e.g. the green
line in Fig. 1) from only a part of J −, which lies prior to
the ray forming event horizon. A wave mode which origi-

nates from J − and reaches J + also experiences a change
in background geometry in the process. In order to ob-
tain the Bogoliubov coeﬃcients between the asymptotic
observers 1 on J − and J +, we need to re-express a set of

1 We can think of observers moving with large speeds and reaching

complete mode functions vω suited to observers on J +
in terms of complete set of mode functions uω, deﬁned
equivalently on J −. When we trace back the out-going
modes vω on J + through the center, (i.e., through r = 0
with r being the Schwarzschild radial co-ordinate) onto
J −, we see that the mode functions suited to J + have
support only on the portion of mode functions uω on J −.
Therefore the Bogoliubov coeﬃcients are obtained by
taking inner products of uω and vω on a portion of J −,
i.e., below the line u = d [1, 3, 7, 8]. (This has an eﬀect
similar to that of partial tracing out of modes in the case
of eternal black hole.) Furthermore, we now also have to
take into account the change of geometry experienced by
the mode function uω when we trace it back to the past
null inﬁnity. However, if we are interested only in the
late time behavior of uω, we can use ray-optics approx-
imation [1, 3, 7, 8] for tracing back the mode functions.
Thus, the late time behavior of the out going asymptotic
future modes is essentially controlled by the tracing over
of portion of J −, rather than the change in the geome-
try. This is the mathematical reason why the dynamics
of the collapse is irrelevant to obtain the temperature
and one obtains the same result as in the case of an eter-
nal black hole and Hartle-Hawking vacuum state. The
exact Bogoliubov coeﬃcients, obtained by going beyond
the ray optics, will, of course, be sensitive to the geome-
try change as well. Further, it is the loss of time reversal
invariance during the collapse which leads to a non-zero
ﬂux of energy, which is absent in the case of an eternal
black hole and Hartle-Hawking vacuum state.

It turns out that a combination of these eﬀects arise in
the case CGHS black hole in 1+1 dimension [5, 13]. The
collapse of quantum matter leads to the standard black
hole evaporation scenario with observers at future right
asymptotic J +
R (t → ∞, x → +∞) detecting a ﬂux of
thermal radiation, which is well-known in the literature.
This situation is mathematically identical to what hap-
pens in the case 1+3 spherically symmetric collapse. But
it turns out that there is another eﬀect in the same space-
time which is very similar to Unruh eﬀect: Observers at
future left asymptotic J +
L (t → ∞, x → −∞) detect a
thermal spectrum (at the same temperature as seen by
observers at J +
R ) but without any associated ﬂux! This
result is surprising because these are geodesic observers
in a ﬂat region of the spacetime who see no change in ge-
ometry. The eﬀect arises due to the necessity of tracing
over part of the modes for describing the physics of the
observers at J +
L and the mathematics closely parallels
standard Unruh eﬀect. But in this case, the necessity to
trace over modes arises due to the dynamics of collapse,
which takes place in a diﬀerent region of the spacetime
though. This eﬀect (which, as far as we know, has been
missed in the CGHS literature) constitutes a dynamics

realization of Unruh eﬀect.

II. A PICTURE BOOK REPRESENTATION

In order to explain the concepts involved in this, rather
peculiar result, we will ﬁrst provide a picture-book de-
scription of how the result arises, which should demystify
it.

R , J −

R , J +

We start with the Minkowski spacetime, for which the
Penrose diagram corresponds to Fig. 2. The full space-
time is bounded by four null lines depicting future and
past left/right null inﬁnities, viz J +
L and J −
L .
In this spacetime any inertial (geodesic) observers will
start from past timelike inﬁnity i− at t = −∞ and would
reach future timelike inﬁnity i+ at t = ∞. Two such
geodesic observers moving leftwards and rightwards re-
spectively, are shown by dashed curves in Fig. 2. In ad-
dition, there can also be some accelerated observers. An
important set of such accelerated observers is the eter-
nally accelerating Rindler observer. The trajectory of
the Rindler observer starts on J −
L and accelerates along
a hyperbolic path to reach J +
L (shown in the thick curve
in Fig. 2). Let us consider the causal support of the tra-
jectories of the Rindler observer vis-´a-vis the inertial ob-
server. The inertial observer has causal access to the
full spacetime, whereas the spacetime region accessed by
the Rindler observer is only a part of the full Minkowski
spacetime. Thus the vacuum state for the inertial ob-
server (who can access the full spacetime) would be dif-
ferent from that of the Rindler observer (for whom only
a part of the spacetime is allowed) leading to non zero
Bogoliubov coeﬃcients. Alternatively, the observations
carried out by the Rindler observer can be described us-
ing a density matrix obtained by tracing out modes inac-
cessible to her. If the ﬁeld is in the inertial vacuum state,
the resulting density matrix will be thermal. This prop-

limit, may be mimicked through late time observers on J +.

erty will hold whenever an observer has a causal access

of only a part of the spacetime and the reduced den-
sity matrix she uses will be thermal. As an illustration
let us consider Fig. 3, where three observers are shown.
The dashed observer is an inertial observer and, as in the
earlier ﬁgure, has access to the full spacetime; the dot-
ted trajectory is that of the standard, eternally accelerat-
ing Rindler observer; the third trajectory (represented by

started as inertial but then changed her mind and accel-
erates uniformly to end up on J +
L just like the Rindler
observer. This observer also has causal connection only
to the past domain of dependence of J +
L′ , which being
only a portion of the full manifold, will lead to thermal
density matrix.

Let us now consider a hypothetical scenario in which
some portion of Minkowski spacetime becomes dynami-
cally inaccessible, as shown in Fig. 4 by the dashed tri-
angular region. (Right now this is the Penrose diagram
of some hypothetical spacetime; we will soon see how it
actually arises in the CGHS case.) Further, we assume
this truncation of spacetime is such that it requires left-
moving geodesic observers to terminate on i+
L instead of
i+ as in Fig. 3. Since these observers derive their causal
support only from the past of J +
L′ , they are compelled
to trace over a portion of ﬁeld conﬁguration on J −
R and
hence they will end up using a density matrix which is
thermal. Whenever any observer, geodesic or not, who
derives her causal support from a subset of the full space-
time, the global vacuum state will appear to be a thermal
state.

The geodesic part of the above statement might appear
perplexing. One may wonder how a geodesic observer can
ever experience such a nontrivial eﬀect usually associated
with accelerated observers. The role of acceleration is
only to make part of the spacetime region inaccessible;
if we can achieve this by some other means, we will still
have the same result. The situation as depicted in Fig. 4
appears unphysical as presented — because we have ar-

tiﬁcially removed part of the spacetime —, but we will
later discuss a situation in which a portion of spacetime
is indeed dynamically denied to a geodesic observer, very
much like in the spirit of the observer in Fig. 4 (shown
in thick magenta curve).

But before we do that, we will consider another exam-
ple in the next section which might make all these less
surprising. This will involve the collapse of a null shell
forming a black hole (see Fig. 5).
In the case, a time-
like geodesic observer at r = 0, will remain entirely in
the ﬂat spacetime until being eaten up by the singularity
and receives causal signals only from a part of J − (see
Fig. 5 below). This study will provide us useful insights
towards the constructs to be used in the later sections of
the paper.

III. A NULL SHELL COLLAPSE

For a closer look at the above mentioned features,
we will ﬁrst consider a null shell collapse forming a
Schwarzschild hole [3, 7, 14–16] (see Fig. 5).
In this
case, the singularity gets originated from the co-ordinate
u = ui, the co-ordinate point of introduction of the null-
shell. (This collapse model will be relevant for compari-
son with the null shell collapse in 1 + 1 dimensional dila-
tonic gravity, forming a black hole, which is discussed
later on.) The singularity starts forming from the co-
ordinate u = ui, while the event horizon is located at
r = 2M , with M being the mass of the shell. The co-
ordinate r = 2M can be reﬂected back through r = 0 on
to J − at u = d. As discussed previously, the out-going
modes vω on J + derive their causal support completely
from the portion u < d on J −. Therefore the Bogoliubov
coeﬃcients of mode transformation, should be evaluated
through the portion of mode functions uω in the regime
u < d. Further, all the null rays emanating from J −
region u < ui also experience a change of geometry, i.e.,
they start moving in ﬂat spacetime inwards, get reﬂected

set of past and future asymptotic observer pairs will be
equivalent to any other. A time-like observer (solid ma-
genta curves in Fig. 6), similarly starting from past time
like inﬁnity and escaping the black hole region, either end
up on i +
R depending upon whether the observer
moves leftwards or rightwards.

L and ending up on J +

Let us consider a set of modes moving rightwards. Any
null ray originating from J −
R will
experience a change of geometry after it crosses the col-
lapsing null shell. For observers on J +
R , the isotropic co-
ordinate |x−| = ∆M marks the location of event horizon.
Therefore, the modes reaching J +
R derive their causal
support from the region I in Fig. 6. No event in the re-
gion II is connected to J +
R . An exactly similar picture
is there for the left-moving modes.

In the standard black hole analysis, the out-going mode

shell to feel the geometry changed into a Schwarzschild
one.

This can be more clearly seen in an isotropic co-
ordinate system (see Fig. 6) which uses a Cartesian x
coordinate with −∞ < x < ∞ instead of the usual ra-
dial coordinate r with 0 < r < ∞. The relevant Penrose

(J −
R ), as well as two future null inﬁni-
ties J +
R . The location of event horizon in these
co-ordinates is marked to (say) ∆M , which corresponds
to r = 2M in Schwarzschild co-ordinates. It is usual to
deﬁne the modes as left moving or right moving in these
co-ordinates. A right moving mode originates from J −
L
and ends up on J +
R and vice versa for the left-moving
modes. Due to spherical symmetry, consideration of any

R all the way down to J −

The Bogoliubov transformation coeﬃcients between
these modes can be evaluated by taking the covariant
inner products on J −
L . However, in order to do that we
need to express mode functions vω on J −
L in terms of
uω. For that purpose we need to track the out-going
modes at J +
L . In principle, this
a formidable job, since the exact form of modes in the
whole spacetime is complicated at best, if obtainable in
closed form. However, appealing to ray-optics approxi-
mation [1, 7] for modes very close to the horizon, we in a
sense, avoid this issue. This approximation gives us the
expression of modes vω close to |x−| = ∆M , i.e., u = d
in terms of uω. We obtain the Bogoliubov coeﬃcients
readily as

However, as we discussed this integration has to be trun-

where C = C1C2 is a product of aﬃne parameters for
in-going (C1) and out-going (C2) null geodesics. From
the rather general nature of the analysis we expect this
result to give the Bogoliubov coeﬃcients for the timelike
observer stationary at r = 0 if we replace d by ui. But
since such an observer is engulfed by a true singularity
when the shell collapse to r = 0, it is somewhat hard to
interpret the result concretely.

In the limit M → 0, the portion being traced over be-
comes small. Further the geometry change as well as the
formation of the singularity does not occur, making J +
a Cauchy surface, which is not the case when M 6= 0.
Since the eﬀect of tracing over is intimately tied with the
eﬀect of geometry change, it is diﬃcult to account for
these eﬀects individually in a general case in 1+3 dimen-
sion. Nevertheless, one can argue that the tracing over of
modes alone leads to Unruh eﬀect with zero ﬂux, whereas

the geometry change makes the thermal radiation more
‘real’ with a non-zero ﬂux [17–20]. The non vanishing of
ﬂux can be associated with moving of the geometry away
from being a ﬂat one. We will see below that these two
eﬀects can nicely be segregated in a 1 + 1 dimensional
collapse model in dilaton gravity.

IV. 1+1 DIMENSIONAL DILATONIC BLACK

HOLE

The CGHS black hole [5, 13] is a 1+1 dimensional grav-
itational collapse model of a dilatonic ﬁeld φ interacting
with gravity in the presence of cosmological constant λ
and matter ﬁelds fi, described by the action,

A =

(5)

Since all two dimensional space-times are conformally ﬂat
the metric ansatz will involve a single unknown function,
the conformal factor ρ, which is written in double null
coordinates as,

moving leftwards collapses to form a black hole [13, 21].
If the matter distribution starts at x+
i and extends up to
x+
f , then the line element corresponding to this matter
conﬁguration turns out to be,

ds2 = −e2ρdx+dx−, with,
x+ ∈ (0,∞), and x− ∈ (−∞, 0).

For the matter ﬁelds, the classical solutions are those in
which, fi = fi+(x+) + fi−(x−). Given some particu-
lar matter ﬁelds one can obtain corresponding solutions
for φ and ρ respectively from the equations of motion.
A simple static solution corresponds to e−2ρ = e−2φ =
(M/λ) − λ2x+x−, representing a black hole of mass M ,

In absence of the mass, M = 0 and we obtain linear

event horizon can be obtained starting from the location
of the apparent horizon, see Fig. 7. This can be obtained
using ∂+A ≤ 0, where A stands for the transverse area
of the horizon in a 3 + 1 dimensional setting. Borrowing
this idea to 1 + 1 dimension, this equality would lead to
the location of the event horizon at x− = −P +/λ2, in
the out region, i.e., after x+ > x+
f .
Thermodynamics as well as Hawking evaporation of
such black hole solutions have been extensively studied
[5, 21–25]. We introduce a co-ordinate set z± suited for
the in-region J −

also introduce another co-ordinate system suited for J +

the out modes are supported by states on J −
L between
the region (−∞, z−
i ) only. These mode functions provide
a complete orthonormal basis on J +
R in terms of σ−
out,
however. Again the ﬁeld can be speciﬁed fully on J −
L or
jointly on J +
R and the event horizon HR. Since the mode
functions at HR correspond to part of the ﬁeld falling
into the singularity and such interior modes cannot be
observed by observers at J +
R , they need to be traced
over. Thus, the precise form of mode decomposition on
HR does not aﬀect physical results for J +
R . Therefore,
we can expand the dilaton ﬁeld in diﬀerent mode basis

Interestingly, all references to the matter content which
formed the black hole, appears only in the phase (see
Eq.(18) and Eq.(19)), through P + and gets wiped out
when we take the modulus. If we follow a null ray orig-
inating from J −
L or a timelike trajectory and moving
rightwards, it suﬀers a change of geometry once it crosses
the collapsing null shell, as in the case for Schwarzschild
hole formation. Therefore, the experiences of these ob-
servers are inclusive of both tracing over and the geome-
try change. Hence, as associated with a black hole forma-
tion, there is an associated ﬂux of radiation as measured
by the observers attached to such trajectories [5, 21].
However, this model being asymmetric under left-right
exchange, provides an opportunity of studying the eﬀect
of tracing over separately, if we consider the left-moving
modes, which we do next.

V. DYNAMICAL UNRUH EFFECT IN CGHS

BLACK HOLE SPACETIME

The CGHS model is not symmetric under left-right ex-
change, and hence the experiences of null ray originating
from J −
R or a timelike trajectory moving leftwards, will
be diﬀerent from what we discussed above. Such trajecto-
ries do not suﬀer any change in geometry in their course,
hence, as we will see, the only eﬀect a late time observer
(the dotted curve in Fig. 8) on J +
L ﬁnds, is rooted only in
the tracing over a part of Cauchy surface J −
R . Therefore,
these observers will also obtain a thermal expectation
value in Eq.(20) as we will see, but there will be no as-
sociated ﬂux for these thermal spectrum. The spacetime

The singularity curve originates from the co-ordinate of
the point of matter introduction, i.e., from x+
i which is
marked through Eq.(21) as y+
i . Under an-
other set of co-ordinate transformations, the metric on
J −
R can also be brought into ﬂat form. On J −
R we adopt

i = −1/λx+

e−λχ+
eλχ−

= −y+,
= y−,

(23)

such that the metric becomes

ds2 = −dχ+dχ−,

with χ± ∈ (−∞,∞). Therefore the complete set of left-
moving mode functions corresponding to the ﬁeld f+(χ+)
can be written in these co-ordinates as

u+
ω (χ+) =

1
√2ω

e−iωχ+

.

Whereas on J +

L we adopt to

e−λ ˜χ+
eλ ˜χ−

= −(y+ − y+
i ),
= y−,

(24)

(25)

such that these new co-ordinates range in ˜χ± ∈ (−∞,∞)
in the region x+ < x+
i . The metric in these new co-
ordinates becomes

ds2 = −

d ˜χ+d ˜χ−
1 − y+

i eλ ˜χ+ .

(26)

The metric Eq.(26) is in a conformally ﬂat form in these
co-ordinates, hence the complete set of left-moving modes
corresponding to f+( ˜χ+) are again given as

ω ( ˜χ+) =
v+

1

(27)

since a minimally coupled scalar ﬁeld is conformally in-
variant in 1 + 1 dimensions. Clearly, on J −
R , v+
ω has sup-
i . The point x+
port only in the region x+ < x+
is mapped
to χ+ ≡ χ+
i ). Therefore, the Bogoliubov
transformation coeﬃcients between these two set of ob-
servers can be obtained exactly as in Eq.(18), Eq.(19)

This form of Bogoliubov coeﬃcients results from the trac-
ing over of a portion of J −
R , which is causally discon-
nected from J +
L is given as y+ = y+
i ,
which also marks the point of singularity.

L . The horizon for J +

This eﬀect can be more clearly understood using non-
availability of Cauchy surfaces for future asymptotic ob-
servers. Let us consider a left moving timelike or null
trajectory. Due to conformal ﬂatness, a complete set of
orthonormal mode functions on any surface orthogonal
to them, can always be obtained as plane waves under a
proper co-ordinatization (which extends as (−∞,∞)) of
that surface. If we consider an orthogonal null surface for
the left moving modes, before the formation of singular-
ity (the red surface labeled ‘2’ in Fig. 8),the Bogoliubov
transformation coeﬃcients between that surface and J −
will be trivial, i.e., (αΩω = δ(Ω− ω), βΩω = 0). However,

FIG. 9: Unavailability of Cauchy surface for left-moving

once the singularity forms, any null surface relating a
point on J −
L to the singularity (e.g., green surface la-
beled ‘1’ in Fig. 9)), fails to causally connect with the
entire spacetime. Also, any timelike observer has a do-
main of dependence, which is not the full spacetime. A
portion of J −
R (right to the dashed green line) is causally
denied to the past of such surfaces. Therefore, the Bo-
goliubov coeﬃcients assume a non-trivial form, such as in

Eq.(18), Eq.(19) or Eq.(28), Eq.(29), with a phase factor
capturing the information about the region of the traced
over modes. This is dynamically similar to a Rindler tra-
jectory in a Minkowski spacetime, see Fig. 2, where an
accelerated observer (orange curve) reaches the future
null inﬁnity rather than future timelike inﬁnity. For such
observers too, the domain of dependence is only a part of
the full spacetime. There is a horizon masking a portion
of spacetime and hence the Bogoliubov transformation
coeﬃcients between J −
L′ (rather than the full
J +
L ) is non-trivial [3, 6, 8] and the accelerated observers
obtain a thermal spectrum for a vacuum state deﬁned on
J −
R . However, there is no ﬂux associated with this spec-
trum as the stress tensor remains identically vanishing in
the ﬂat spacetime.

R and J +

Similarly in the CGHS model, the region of spacetime
y+ > y+
is dynamically made inaccessible to any left-
i
moving time-like or null trajectories, which also is the
case with such trajectories in the null collapse forming
a Schwarzschild black hole Fig. 6. However, in contrast
to the Schwarzschild case, such observers in the CGHS
model, do not see any change of geometry hence they
do not associate any mass to the “black hole region” as
seen by them. The spacetime, they move in, through-
out, is ﬂat and such observers do not receive any ﬂux of
radiation, as the vacuum expectation value of the stress
energy tensor which was vanishing on J −
R , stays put on
zero, in the region y+ < y+
i . As we discussed previ-
ously Eq.(20), the right moving observers tuned to right
moving modes, witness a thermal radiation ﬂux at a tem-
perature 1/λ which is independent of the matter content
of the forming black hole and depends only on the other
dimensionful parameter in the theory.

Similarly, the observers at J +

L coupled to left-moving
modes, observe a similar kind of Bogoliubov coeﬃcients
as their right-moving counterparts Eq.(18), Eq.(19) but
with the parameter exchange |y+
i | ↔ P +/λ which mark
the corresponding event horizons for such observers and
appear as overall phases in the transformation coeﬃ-
cients. Hence, we see that such form of Bogoliubov coef-
ﬁcients Eq.(28), Eq.(29) are entirely due to tracing over

FIG. 10: Freely falling observers in CGHS black hole space-

of modes which lie in the causally denied region of space-
time, to I+
L and not due to any geometry change. One
can check that if the fraction of tracing over vanishes,
which is marked by |y+
i | → 0, the Bogoliubov coeﬃ-
cients assume a trivial form, i.e., αΩω → δ(Ω − ω) while
βΩω → 0. Similarly, the Bogoliubov coeﬃcients for the
right-moving observers Eq.(18), Eq.(19), assume a triv-
ial form in the limit P + → 0, marking the vanishing of
event horizon, as well as, the amount of change of ge-
ometry suﬀered by such observers. Hence, for such ob-
servers eﬀects of tracing over is indistinguishable from
geometry change. Both these eﬀects vanish simultane-
ously in that limit. Therefore, we see that the vacuum
response for both left-moving or right-moving observers
is indistinguishable from each other. Late time radiation
for such observers on J +
R for vacuum state
(of a test ﬁeld) is thermal. However, unlike the left-
moving observers, the right moving observers associate
a ﬂux also with the radiation and hence the black hole
region shrinks as a result of the evaporation. While left-
moving observers do not associate any mass to the region
beyond their horizon, the location of their horizon does
not shrink and the “black hole region” does not evaporate
for them.

L or on J +

All the geodesic observers moving rightwards or re-
maining stationary at any ﬁnite value (with the exception
of stationary observer at left inﬁnity) end up in singular-
ity and in this process have to undergo a geometry change
(cyan curves in Fig. 10), so they witness a combined ef-
fect and hence a ﬂux of radiation, as in the Schwarzschild
scenario [15, 16, 26]. Whereas the left-moving timelike
observers end up at i+
L , do not see any geometry change
but encounter ﬂux-free thermal radiation due to a dy-
namical emergence of a horizon, which traces out infor-
mation of a section of ﬁeld conﬁguration, exactly in the
spirit of the Rindler observer, as discussed previously.

Finally, we will comment on the back-reaction due to
black hole evaporation and its implications for our result.
To compute any kind of back-reaction in the spacetime in
Einstein gravity, one needs to use an equation of the form

9

Gab = hTabi. Neither side of this equation can be han-
dled without additional assumptions and, obviously, the
result will depend on the additional assumptions! The
left-hand-side identically vanishes in D = 2 because Ein-
stein tensor identically vanishes in two dimensions. The
right hand side is: (i) divergent and needs to be regu-
larized and (ii) depends on the quantum state which is
chosen. The best we can do, therefore, is to give pre-
scriptions to deﬁne both sides and the results will obvi-
ously depend on these prescriptions. We discuss our set
of choices while describing the pertinent issues in two-
dimensional gravity below.

To get a non-zero left hand side, one postulates some
non-Einsteinian form of the gravity action (like the
CGHS action in Eq.(5)) and vary the metric to get the
equations of motion. Obviously, this is not Gab (which,
of course, is zero) but can possibly act as a proxy for
the same. We stress the fact that we are trying to model
some gravitational features by some suitable dilatonic ac-
tion and one cannot ignore the implicit ad-hocness in the
procedure. For example, in such an approach, one also
often takes the the normal ordered, non-covariant, ex-
pectation value of the stress energy tensor as the classi-
cal source. However, in a two-dimensional spacetime, the
expectation value of the stress energy tensor comes with
a conformal anomaly term [5] as well. The anomaly term
can then act as an extra source of stress energy and may
lead to an evolution diﬀerent from the classical case, if
not accounted for properly. A prescription used in the
literature is to add some extra terms (e.g. Polyakov ac-
tion, RST action terms) to the standard CGHS action
corresponding to the conformal anomaly terms and ob-
tain these modiﬁed equations of motion, as a result of
the variational principle. But this new action will corre-
spond to a diﬀerent physical system, though one which
can also be thought of as a proxy for gravity. But in
this prescription, ﬂat spacetime will not be a solution to
the vacuum state for the semiclassical equations due to
the anomaly, which we consider somewhat unphysical.
There is no unique way of handling this issue because,
as we stressed before, Gab = 0 in D = 2 and the left
hand side which we work with to mimic Gab = hTabi de-
pends crucially on the model we use, with the hope that
it can mimic aspects of D = 4 gravity. We have chosen
simple, physically well-motivated choices to do this as we
describe next.

To analyze the right hand side, we need a scheme for
deﬁning a c−number stress tensor from the quantum op-
erator and the vacuum state has to be motivated from
some speciﬁc (geometric) considerations. We have de-
ﬁned the vacuum state by a natural assumption: viz.
that the geometry must remain ﬂat when sourced by
such a (vacuum) state. This is important because as
we discussed, in two-dimensional spacetime, the expec-
tation value of the stress energy tensor has a conformal
anomaly term which can violate this criterion in general,
if this term is not accounted for in the source terms in
the RHS. However, there exists a family of such states

[27] which take care of the conformal anomaly terms and
ensure that the geometry remains ﬂat when the state is a
vacuum from this family. Therefore the results discussed
in this work, use stability of the solution under these class
of states. A more detailed analysis of conformal anomaly
modiﬁed evaporating black holes can be found in [5]. Our
scheme to deal with such terms will be reported in details
elsewhere [28].
