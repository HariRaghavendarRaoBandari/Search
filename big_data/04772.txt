Abstract

Within the derivative expansion of conformally reduced gravity, the modiﬁed split

Ward identities are shown to be compatible with the ﬂow equations if and only

if either the anomalous dimension vanishes or the cutoﬀ proﬁle is chosen to be

power law. No solutions exist if the Ward identities are incompatible. In the com-

patible case, a clear reason is found for why Ward identities can still forbid the

existence of ﬁxed points; however, for any cutoﬀ proﬁle, a background independent

(and parametrisation independent) ﬂow equation is uncovered. Finally, expanding

in vertices, the combined equations are shown generically to become either over-

constrained or highly redundant beyond the six-point level.

Introduction

Following ref. [1], non-perturbative RG (renormalization group) ﬂows for quantum gravity have

been formulated by utilising the technical device of splitting the metric in terms of a background

metric and a ﬂuctuation ﬁeld (see also the reviews [2–6]). Physical results must then be independent

of this split, in other words should be background independent. The background metric however

is in particular also used (via the background Laplacian) to deﬁne the eﬀective cutoﬀ scale k. This

breaks background independence at intermediate scales k but such that background independence
can be recovered in the limit k → 0 providing certain modiﬁed split Ward identities (msWIs) are
imposed [7–17].

An unsettling conclusion from the research reported in ref. [16] is that the requirement of back-

ground independence in a theory of quantum gravity can actually be in conﬂict with renormalization

group (RG) properties in ﬂows formulated as above: ﬁxed points under changes in the eﬀective
cutoﬀ scale k, can be forbidden by the msWIs that are enforcing background independence.1

In the conformally truncated gravity model investigated in ref. [16], this happens generically

when the anomalous dimension η is non-vanishing. It can however be avoided by a careful choice of

parametrisation f (setting it to be a power of χ determined by its scaling dimension [16]). On the

other hand it was shown in ref. [16] that the situation is saved in all cases, at least in the conformally

reduced gravity model, by the existence of an alternative background-independent description. This
involves in particular a background-independent notion of scale, ˆk. This background independent

description exists at a deeper underlying level since in terms of these background-independent

variables, the RG ﬁxed points and corresponding ﬂows always exist, and are manifestly independent

of the choice of parametrisation f (χ).

After approximating the exact RG ﬂow equations and msWIs to second order in the derivative

expansion (as will be reviewed later), the crucial technical insight was to notice that, just as in the

scalar ﬁeld theory model [9], the msWIs and RG ﬂow equations can be combined into linear partial

diﬀerential equations. It is the solution of the latter equations by the method of characteristics,

that uncovers the background independent variables. And it is by comparing the description in

these variables with the equivalent description in the original variables, that we see that ﬁxed points

in the original variables are in general forbidden by background independence.

However in order to facilitate combining the RG ﬂow equations and msWIs when the anomalous

independence is never broken [18].

dimension η (cid:54)= 0, the authors of ref. [16] were led to a particular form of cutoﬀ proﬁle Rk, namely
a power-law cutoﬀ proﬁle. We will show in this paper that in fact this cutoﬀ proﬁle plays a rˆole

that is much deeper than the convenience of this mathematical trick. Whilst at the exact level the

msWIs are guaranteed to be compatible with the exact RG ﬂow equation (for completeness and

later purposes we provide a proof in sec. 3.1), this will typically not be the case once approximated.
We will see that in the O(∂2) derivative expansion approximation derived in ref. [16], the msWI

and ﬂow equations are in fact compatible if and only if either the cutoﬀ proﬁle is power law, or we

have the special case that η = 0.

If the msWIs are not compatible with the ﬂow equations, it does not immediately follow that

there are no simultaneous solution to the system of equations. However, as we argue in sec. 3.4

and verify by example in sec. 4.2 (see also sec. 5), if the msWIs are not compatible, the equations

are overconstrained and it is for this reason that it is hopeless to expect any solutions.

The example is furnished by choosing optimised cutoﬀ proﬁle and LPA, but keeping η non-

vanishing. In fact it is natural to expect η to be non-vanishing at the LPA level for conformally

truncated gravity, as explained in ref. [19]. Choosing a power-law form for f the equations at ﬁrst

sight then look consistent and able to support ﬁxed points. Although we already know that the

msWI is in this case incompatible with the ﬂow equation, it is still possible to combine the msWI

and ﬂow equation into a linear partial diﬀerential equation. Solving this, we conﬁrm that for the
combined system there are no solutions with η (cid:54)= 0, supporting the arguments in sec. 3.4. In sec. 5,
by considering the simplest polynomial truncation, we also verify very straightforwardly that there

can be no ﬁxed points.

For power-law cutoﬀ proﬁle the equations are compatible, however we will see very clearly in
sec. 4.1 why with η (cid:54)= 0 and non-power-law parametrisation f , there can be no ﬁxed points with
respect to k.

Actually, power law cutoﬀ proﬁles have nice properties in that they ensure that the derivative ex-

pansion approximation preserves the quantisation of the anomalous dimension in non-gravitational
systems, e.g. scalar ﬁeld theory [20–22].2 Nevertheless, given the unsettling nature of the con-

clusions in ref. [16], it is important to understand to what extent the results depend on cutoﬀ

proﬁle.

Since η = 0 is suﬃcient to allow the derivative expansions of the exact RG and msWI equations

to be compatible, we can therefore investigate in this case the implications of background inde-

2Although as with the optimised cutoﬀ [23, 24], they do not allow a derivative expansion to all orders [25–27].

pendence, whatever the cutoﬀ proﬁle. The conclusions are the same for any cutoﬀ proﬁle that is

not power law, so for simplicity and to make the equations completely explicit, we take the pop-

ular and simple choice of optimised cutoﬀ [23, 24]. Just as found for power law cutoﬀ [19] in this

case, background-independent variables exist, and k-ﬁxed points exist; these coincide with the ﬁxed

points in background-independent variables. In terms of background-independent variables and at

LPA level, the full line of ﬁxed points is visible, conﬁrming the ﬁndings for power-law cutoﬀ [19].

Although we can show this by exact analysis of the LPA ﬂow and msWI equations, using the

trick of combining these equations into a linear partial diﬀerential equation, it is very instructive

to analyse these equations without using this trick and also by considering only polynomial trun-

cations, since it seems likely that this is the only way we could investigate this issue using the

exact non-perturbative ﬂow equations. Viewed from this perspective, we will see that the problem

is that if the RG ﬁxed point equations and msWI equations are truly independent, then they will

overconstrain the solutions if carried to suﬃciently high order truncation. Indeed, expanding in
powers of the ﬂuctuation ﬁeld ϕ to the mth level and background ﬁeld χ to the nth level, we get one

ﬁxed point equation for each (m, n)-point vertex and one msWI equation per vertex. Even though

each of these equations is open (depending on yet higher-point vertices) we will see that since there

are two equations for every vertex, at suﬃciently high order truncation there are more equations

than vertices (indeed eventually double the number) and thus either the equations become highly

redundant or the vertices are constrained to the point where there are no solutions.

This analysis strongly suggests therefore that the full non-perturbative Ward identities would

lead to important constraints on RG properties. Unfortunately it seems very challenging to inves-

tigate this, since we will see that the number of equations only exceeds the number of vertices for

the ﬁrst time at the six-point level. We discuss potential conﬂict for the exact non-perturbative

ﬂow equations further in the conclusions.

2 Conformally reduced gravity at order derivative-squared

In this section we give a quick resum´e of the results we need and their context, from ref. [16]. We

arrive at conformally reduced gravity (in Euclidean signature) by writing:

˜gµν = f ( ˜φ)ˆgµν = f (χ + ˜ϕ)ˆgµν

and

¯gµν = f (χ)ˆgµν .

(2.1)

Here ˜gµν is the metric that is integrated over in the partition function. It is restricted to an overall
conformal factor f ( ˜φ) times a ﬁducial metric which in fact we set to ﬂat: ˆgµν = δµν.

5

Examples of parametrisations used previously in the literature include f (φ) = exp(2φ) [28] and
f (φ) = φ2 [13,29]. However we leave the choice of parametrisation f unspeciﬁed. It is important to

note however that f cannot depend on k since it is introduced at the bare level and has no relation

to the infrared cutoﬀ (moreover if f depended on k, the ﬂow equation (2.2) would no longer hold).

Later we will change to dimensionless variables using k and in these variables it can be forced to

depend on k (see especially secs. 3.5 and 4.1).

We split the total conformal factor ﬁeld ˜φ(x) into a background conformal factor ﬁeld χ(x) and

ﬂuctuation conformal factor ﬁeld ˜ϕ(x). It is then the latter that is integrated over. Also as shown,

we similarly parametrise the background metric ¯gµν in terms of the background conformal factor
ﬁeld χ. Introducing the classical ﬂuctuation ﬁeld ϕ = (cid:104) ˜ϕ(cid:105) and total classical ﬁeld φ = (cid:104) ˜φ(cid:105) = χ + ϕ,
the eﬀective action satisﬁes the ﬂow equation

with µ being a ﬁxed reference scale, which can be thought of as being the usual arbitrary ﬁnite

physical mass-scale. Rk is the cutoﬀ operator responsible for suppressing momentum modes be-

low the infrared cutoﬀ scale k, cf. [30, 31]. The crucial observation is that in the context of the

background ﬁeld method in quantum gravity the cutoﬀ operator itself depends on the background

ﬁeld χ. The reason for this is that the cutoﬀ operator is a function of the covariant Laplacian of

(cid:0)− ¯∇2(cid:1), as it is with respect to the spectrum of − ¯∇2 that modes are

integrated out or suppressed in the path integral, cf. [32, 33].

A remnant diﬀeomorphism invariance enforces this χ dependence in the approximation chosen

in ref. [16]. By specialising to a background metric ¯gµν that is slowly varying, so that space-

time derivatives of this can be neglected, we eﬀectively terminate at the level of the LPA for the
background conformal factor χ. For the classical ﬂuctuating conformal factor ϕ however, O(∂2) in
the derivative expansion approximation is fully implemented, making no other approximation. The

eﬀective action thus takes its most general form at this level of truncation:

(2.5)

Exact background independence would be realised if the right hand side of the msWI was zero,

implying that the eﬀective action is only a functional of the total ﬁeld φ = χ+ϕ. The presence of the

cutoﬀ operator however causes the right hand side to be non-vanishing in general. It is only in the
limit k → 0 (holding physical, i.e. unscaled, momenta and ﬁelds ﬁxed) that the cutoﬀ operator drops
out and background independence can be restored exactly. We note therefore that imposing the

msWI in addition to the ﬂow equation (2.2) automatically ensures exact background independence
in the limit k → 0. The observation we further explore in this paper is that restricting ﬂows to
satisfy (2.6) then has consequences for the RG properties, in particular ﬁxed point behaviour, that

follows from (2.2).

3 Compatibility of the msWI with the ﬂow equation

Compatibility of the msWI with the ﬂow equation means the following. Write the msWI in the
form W = 0 and assume that this holds at some scale k. Computing ˙W by using the ﬂow equation,
˙W = 0 then follows at scale k without further constraints.
we say that the msWI is compatible if
In the ﬁrst part of this section we rederive the ﬂow equation and msWI for conformally reduced

gravity but organised in a diﬀerent way from ref. [16] so as to make the next derivation more

transparent. We then prove that they are compatible with one another. So far, this is naturally to

be expected since both are derived from the same partition function. For completeness we include

it here in order to fully understand the issues once we consider derivative expansions. (For a proof

of the exact case in a more general context see ref. [17].) In the second part we study the notion of

compatibility for conformally reduced gravity in the truncation (2.4). Asking for compatibility in

the derivative expansion is actually non-trivial. We derive the requirements necessary to achieve

it.

3.1 Compatibility at the exact level

The proof of compatibility of the un-truncated system consists of demonstrating that the RG time

derivative of the msWI is proportional to the msWI itself [34,35]. In analogy with references [34,35],

we expect to ﬁnd that this RG time derivative is, more speciﬁcally, proportional to a second

functional derivative with respect to ϕ acting on the msWI and it is with this in mind that we

proceed (see also ref. [17]).

We begin by considering the following Euclidean functional integral over the ﬂuctuation ﬁeld ˜ϕ

exp(Wk) =

D ˜ϕ exp (−S[χ + ˜ϕ] − Sk[ ˜ϕ, ¯g] + Ssrc[ ˜ϕ, ¯g]) .

(3.1)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

(cid:112)

(cid:90)

(cid:112)

This integral is regulated in the UV (as it must be), however we leave this regularisation implicit

in what follows. Compatibility can be shown most easily by presenting both the ﬂow equation and

the msWI as matrix expressions. Thus we begin by rewriting the source term using matrix notation

like so

where Txy ≡ T (x, y) ≡ (cid:112)

ddx

¯g(x) ˜ϕ(x)J(x) ≡ ˜ϕxTxyJy ≡ ˜ϕ · T · J ,

(3.2)
¯g(x)δ(x − y) and the dot notation represents integration over position

Ssrc[ ˜ϕ, ¯g] =

space. Similarly, we write the cutoﬀ action as

Sk[ ˜ϕ, ¯g] =

1
2

ddx

¯g(x) ˜ϕ(x)Rk[¯g] ˜ϕ(x) ≡ 1
2

˜ϕxrxy ˜ϕy ≡ 1

˜ϕ · r · ˜ϕ ,

where

rxy ≡ r(x, y) ≡(cid:112)

¯g(x)

(cid:112)

¯g(y)Rk(x, y) ,

and where the cutoﬀ operator and its kernel are related according to

Rk(x, y) = Rk,x

δ(x − y)(cid:112)

¯g(y)

.

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.10)

(3.11)

We refrain from putting a k subscript on rxy to avoid clutter with indices, but note that it still has

k-dependence. Also note that now the factors of

¯g are no longer part of the integration; this is to

enable all χ-dependent quantities to be easily accounted for when acting with δ/δχ later on. With

these deﬁnitions in place, the RG time derivative of (3.1) gives

˙Wk = − 1
2

˙rxy (cid:104) ˜ϕx ˜ϕy(cid:105) .

In the usual way, we take the Legendre transform of Wk:

˜Γk = J · T · ϕ − Wk with T · ϕ =

δWk
δJ

and from this we deﬁne the eﬀective average action

From (3.7), it also follows that

Γk[ϕ, ¯g] = ˜Γk[ϕ, ¯g] − Sk[ϕ, ¯g] .

The msWI is derived by applying the split symmetry transformations (2.5), with inﬁnitesimal ε(x),

to the functional integral (3.1). The bare action is invariant under this shift, however the source

term and cutoﬀ action are not.

It is the breaking of this symmetry that indicates background

independence has been lost. Applying these shifts to (3.1) we obtain

3.2 Compatibility versus derivative expansion

Figure 3.1: The two-loop diagrams in (3.20). Their symmetry immediately implies the identity

(3.21). Momentum ﬂow is indicated in the case where the ﬂuctuation ﬁeld ϕ is then set to zero.

Recalling from (3.11) that ∆ is an infrared regulated full propagator, we see from (3.20) that

the identity (3.21) can be understood diagrammatically in terms of two-loop diagrams as sketched
in ﬁg. 3.1. The symmetry of these diagrams means that nothing changes if we exchange ˙r ↔ δr/δχ.
This exchange immediately leads to the identity (3.21).

If the Ward identity is

approximated by a derivative expansion, the full propagator in the one-loop term in (3.16) is also

expanded in a derivative expansion. This full propagator has loop momentum q say, and is then

expanded in powers of momenta carried by the external ﬂuctuation ﬁeld ϕ(p), i.e. by the external

legs. The RG time derivative of the Ward identity yields the RG time derivative of such vertices, as
can be seen from the δ2 ˙Γk/δϕ2 term in (3.17). This latter term has two internal legs given by the

explicit functional derivatives, carrying the loop momentum q and joining full internal propagators
∆, and any number of external legs contained in the vertices of ˙Γk. Substituting the ﬂow equation

(3.10) then gives in particular the last term in eqn. (3.18) in which two of these external legs are now

joined to form a loop connected via ˙r. However it is momenta external to this new loop which are

Taylor expanded in the derivative expansion of the ﬂow equation (see also [26,27]). This is illustrated

in the diagram displayed in ﬁg. 3.1. In particular when the remaining external ﬂuctuation ﬁeld

dependence is removed by setting ϕ = 0, we have exactly the momentum dependence displayed

in the ﬁgure. We see that a derivative expansion of the Ward identity involves Taylor expanding

in small p, while integrating over q. However a derivative expansion of the ﬂow equation involves

Taylor expanding in small q, and integrating over p instead. Thus the symmetry between the two

loops is broken and the identity (3.21) no longer follows.

On the other hand we see that if ˙r and δr/δχ have the same momentum dependence then the

identity (3.21) is restored because it is no longer possible to distinguish the two loops. Returning

√

the placement of

¯g from (3.4) to the integration measure, this in fact would give us the relation

(3.40) that is necessary and suﬃcient for compatibility of the Ward identities within the derivative

expansion, and which we will now derive directly within the derivative expansion.

3.3 Compatibility at order derivative-squared
We now proceed to calculate the ﬂow of the msWI for the system truncated at O(∂2) as described
in sec. 2, and investigate directly under which circumstances it vanishes. Let us start by writing

the ﬂow equations and msWIs for both V and K in the following form so that we can study both

cases simultaneously:

˙A(ϕ, χ) =

The ﬁrst two relations are derived by subtracting the msWI from the ﬂow equation for V and K/f

respectively. The last relation is then derived by using the ﬁrst two relations above together with

the deﬁnition of Qp given in (2.11).

We begin by taking the RG time derivative of (3.24). Substituting in the ﬂow equation for ˙A,

and remembering the power of f (χ) hidden in the integral over p, this gives

where a, b, c, e, i, j, k (not to be confused with the cutoﬀ scale), and l are non-negative integers.

From the structure of the terms in Pp one can read oﬀ the following sum rule for the exponents:

a + b + c = e − 1 .

(3.31)

Notice that the case Bp = Qp for the potential is also included, since a = b = c = l = 0 and e = 1

also satisﬁes the sum rule. Taking the term under the ﬁrst integral of (3.29), we ﬁnd

[ ˙R, ∂χR + γR]qp ,

(3.37)

which we see contains only terms that contain either the Ward identities or the ‘commutator’
[ ˙R, ∂χR + γR]qp. On the other hand for the ﬂow of the K/f msWI, the terms do not collect, so
that it remains separately dependent on the individual ˜Bp. However each term either contains the

14

Ward identities themselves, the ‘commutator’ [ ˙R, ∂χR + γR]qp, or the additional commutator-like

structures:

(∂χRp + γRp) ∂k

p2 ˙Rp − ˙Rp∂k

p2 (∂χRp + γRp) .

(3.38)

These appear in the third line of (3.36), and the integer k takes values 1 and 2. For a general cutoﬀ

Rp, these two additional commutator terms neither vanish nor combine with other terms of the

ﬂow.

If [ ˙R, ∂χR + γR]qp vanishes, the ﬂow (3.37) of the V msWI is automatically satisﬁed providing

that both the K and V msWI are also satisﬁed. In this case we have by rearrangement that

(∂χRp + γRp) / ˙Rp = (∂χRq + γRq) / ˙Rq ,

which means that the ratio is independent of momentum. Equivalently

∂χRp + γRp = F (χ, t) ˙Rp ,

(3.39)

(3.40)

where F can be a function of χ and t but not of p. However it is straightforward to see that (3.40)

also forces the additional commutators (3.38) to vanish.

We have therefore shown that all the commutator-like terms vanish if and only if

˙Rp and
∂χRp + γRp have the same dependence on p, with the consequence that both the ˙W (A) vanish, if
the Ward identities W (A) themselves vanish. Since for general choices of the functions, the vanishing
of the ‘commutators’ is surely necessary to achieve ˙W (A) = 0 without further restriction, we have
thus shown that the condition (3.40) is necessary and suﬃcient to ensure compatibility, as deﬁned

at the beginning of this section.

3.4 Incompatibility implies no solutions

However even if the commutators do not vanish, and thus the Ward identities are incompatible

with the ﬂow equations, a priori there could still be a non-empty restricted set of solutions that

both satisfy the ﬂow equations and Ward identities. In this case the equations are satisﬁed not

by the vanishing of the commutators themselves, but by the fact that for the given solutions the

sum of all these terms vanish after performing the integration over momenta. Therefore, as well as
obeying the ﬂow equations and the msWIs W (A) = 0, the solutions must also separately obey two
further conditions, namely the vanishing of the right hand sides of (3.36). In the language of Dirac’s
classiﬁcation of constraints [36, 37], the W (A) = 0 provide the primary constraints. We have shown
that if the ‘commutators’ do not vanish, then the solutions are subject also to non-trivial secondary

15

constraints

˙W (A) = 0. Given the involved form of

˙W (K) in particular, we can be sure that the
procedure does not close and that actually there is then an inﬁnite tower of secondary constraints,
t W (A) = 0, ∀ n > 0, all of which must be satisﬁed. It would therefore seem inevitable that there
∂n
are in fact no non-trivial solutions in this case. We will conﬁrm this by example in sec. 4.2. We

conclude that the vanishing of the ‘commutators’, and hence condition (3.40), is both necessary and

suﬃcient for there to be any solutions to the ﬂows and Ward identities in the derivative expansion

approximation outlined in sec. 2.

The condition (3.40) was already used in ref. [16], where however it was introduced as a math-

ematical trick to help solve the coupled system of ﬂow equations and msWI. As we recall below,
it implies either that η = 0 or Rp is of power-law form. We now see that the requirement for ˙Rp

and ∂χRp + γRp to have the same dependence on p, goes much deeper: the ﬂow equations (2.7)

and (2.9), and the Ward identities (2.8) and (2.10), are incompatible without this constraint, and

incompatibility forces there to be no solutions to the combined system.

3.5 Required form of the cutoﬀ proﬁle

Note that Rp must take a form that respects the scaling dimensions. Introducing dimensionless

variables for use in the next section and later, we can make these scaling dimensions explicit by

employing the RG scale k. We denote the new dimensionless quantities with a bar. We have

ϕ = kη/2 ¯ϕ,

V (ϕ, χ) = kdV ¯V ( ¯ϕ, ¯χ),

χ = kη/2 ¯χ,

f (χ) = kdf ¯f (χ),
K(ϕ, χ) = kdR−2+df ¯K( ¯ϕ, ¯χ),

where

dV = d(1 − df /2)

and

dR = dV − η ,

and thus from (3.3) and (2.1), we have by dimensions that Rp must take the form

(3.41)

(3.42)

(3.43)

R(p2/f ) = −kdR r

= −kdR r(ˆp2) ,

(cid:19)

(cid:18) p2

k2−df f

(cid:112)

kdf−2/f .

where r is a dimensionless cutoﬀ proﬁle of a dimensionless argument,4 and we have introduced the

dimensionless momentum magnitude ˆp = p

If

˙Rp and ∂χRp + γRp have the same dependence on p, i.e. satisfy (3.40), then either η = 0 or

Rp is of power-law form [16]. To see this, note that from (3.43) and (3.25) we have

γ ˙Rp = dV [∂χRp + γRp] − ηγRp .

(3.44)

4The minus sign in (3.43) is necessary to work with the wrong sign kinetic term in (2.4) [16].

16

Thus (choosing F = γ/dV ) we see that (3.40) is satisﬁed if η = 0, without further restriction on R.
However if η (cid:54)= 0, then (3.44) together with (3.40) implies

r(ˆp2) = −d

Since the term in brackets does not depend on p, we see that this is only possible if in fact the

term in brackets is a constant. Setting this constant to be 2n/d for some constant n, we thus also
deduce that r ∝ ˆp−2n.

An example of a cutoﬀ that does not satisfy (3.40) if η (cid:54)= 0, and thus leads to incompatible

msWIs in this case, is the optimised cutoﬀ [23, 24]:

r(ˆp2) = (1 − ˆp2)θ(1 − ˆp2) .

(3.47)

It is straight-forward to conﬁrm that this does not satisfy (3.40) if η (cid:54)= 0. Using (3.43) and (3.44)
we ﬁnd

˙Rp ∝ dV

θ(1 − ˆp2) + (1 − ˆp2)θ(1 − ˆp2)

− η (1 − ˆp2)θ(1 − ˆp2) .

(3.48)

In order for (3.47) to satisfy (3.40), the right hand side must be proportional to ∂χRp + γRp i.e. to

the term in square brackets. This is only true if η = 0.

4 LPA equations

We will now use the Local Potential Approximation to further investigate the restriction imposed

by the msWI on the RG ﬂow equation, in terms of general solutions and also on the existence of

k-ﬁxed points (i.e. RG ﬁxed points with respect to variations in k). We start with a very clear

example where the msWI forbids the existence of k-ﬁxed points.

Then using the concrete example of the optimised cutoﬀ we show explicitly that compatibility

forces η = 0 for non-power-law cutoﬀs. Setting η = 0 we will see that background independent

variables exist, in other words they exist whenever the msWI is compatible with the ﬂow. We will
also see that such ˆk-ﬁxed points coincide with the k-ﬁxed points. The background independent

variables allow us to solve for the ﬁxed points explicitly, uncovering a line of ﬁxed points, consistent

with the ﬁndings for power-law cutoﬀ [19].

17

4.1 Demonstration of background independence forbidding ﬁxed points in gen-

eral

We use the change to dimensionless variables (3.41) and (3.43). In the LPA we discard the ﬂow
and Ward identity for K, and set ¯K = 1. The result, for general cutoﬀ proﬁle r(ˆp2), is:

.

Note that since f cannot depend on t (see the discussion in sec. 2), once we go to dimensionless (i.e.
scaled) variables, ¯f is in general forced to depend on t if χ has non-vanishing scaling dimension η. At
the (k-)ﬁxed point we must have ∂t ¯V = 0. We see at once why ﬁxed points are generically forbidden
by the msWI: the ﬁxed point potential ¯V would have to be independent of t, but through (4.2) and
(4.3) this is impossible in general since ¯V is forced to be dependent on explicit t-dependence in ¯f
through the Ward identity. This is true even in the case of power-law cutoﬀ proﬁle5 which as we

have seen allows (4.2) to be compatible with the ﬂow (4.1).

At ﬁrst sight an escape from this problem is simply to set f to be power law. Indeed setting

f ∝ χρ for some constant ρ, (4.3) implies

¯γ =

d
2

ρ
¯χ

,

(4.4)

and thus (4.2) no longer has explicit t dependence. Recall that for power-law cutoﬀ proﬁles r, it was
indeed found that k-ﬁxed points for ¯V are allowed if f is chosen of power law form [16].6 However we

have seen in sec. 3.5 that any other cutoﬀ proﬁle does not allow the Ward identity to be compatible

with the ﬂow unless η = 0. We argued in sec. 3.4 that incompatibility overconstrains the equations

leading to no solutions. In the next subsection, sec. 4.2, we will conﬁrm this explicitly, choosing as

a concrete example the optimised cutoﬀ proﬁle and space-time dimension d = 4.

On the other hand, if we set η = 0 then the msWI (4.2) is compatible with the ﬂow (4.1), for

any parametrisation f . Apparently k-ﬁxed points are also now allowed without further restriction,

5And indeed this issue was highlighted, but in a diﬀerent way in ref. [16].
6This is true also for ¯K. However if the dimensions of f and χ do not match up, these ﬁxed points do not agree

with the background independent ˆk-ﬁxed points and furthermore the eﬀective action Γk still runs with k [16].

18

since again (4.3) loses its explicit t dependence. Opting once more for optimised cutoﬀ proﬁle and

d = 4, we will see in sec. 4.3 that indeed they are allowed and furthermore they coincide with ﬁxed

points in a background independent description that we also uncover.

4.2 Conﬁrmation of no solutions if the msWI is incompatible with the ﬂow

Specialising to optimised cutoﬀ and (for simplicity) the most interesting case of spacetime dimension

d = 4, the equations read

∂t ¯V + dV ¯V − η

∂ ¯χ ¯V − ∂ ¯ϕ ¯V + ¯γ ¯V =

Choosing power law f and thus (4.4) there is no explicit t dependence and apparently these equa-

tions can work together. Combining them by eliminating their right hand sides, we get

2∂t ¯V + η ¯V − (η ¯ϕ − α ¯χ) ∂ ¯ϕ ¯V − (η + α) ¯χ∂ ¯χ ¯V = 0 ,

(4.7)

where we have introduced the constant α = (dR + η/2)/ρ. This equation can be solved by the

method of characteristics (see e.g. the appendix in ref. [16]). Parametrising the characteristic

curves with t, they are generated by the following equations:

Since ˆV ( ˆφ, ˆχ) is independent of t, we see there are no solutions unless η = 0. We saw in sec. 3.5

4.3 Background independence at vanishing anomalous dimension

We now set η = 0. As recalled in sec. 3.5, the msWI is now compatible with the ﬂow, and

furthermore from (4.3) the explicit t dependence has dropped out. For power-law cutoﬀ proﬁles we
found that k-ﬁxed points exist and coincide with background independent ˆk-ﬁxed points for any

form of f with any dimension df [16]. We will see that for non-power law cutoﬀ that the same

is true. (Again we choose optimised cutoﬀ and d = 4 as an explicit example.) We will uncover

consistent background independent variables for which the full line of ﬁxed points is visible [19].
Since η = 0, in the equations (4.5) and (4.6), we also have dR = dV = 2(2 − df ) and ¯γ =
2∂ ¯χ ln ¯f ( ¯χ). Note that from (3.43), df = 2 is excluded otherwise the IR cutoﬀ no longer depends

on k. Also note that since η = 0 we can drop the bars on χ and ϕ. Combining the equations into

a linear partial diﬀerential equation we get

∂t ¯V +

2 − df
∂χ ln ¯f

(cid:0)∂ϕ ¯V − ∂χ ¯V(cid:1) = 0 ,

Solving the ﬁrst equation gives:

ˆt = t +

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

where the integration constant ˆt is thus the background independent deﬁnition of RG time (see the

appendix to ref. [16]). Exponentiating,

ˆk = k(cid:8) ¯f (χ)(cid:9) 1

2−df = k

1−df
2−df {f (χ)} 1

2−df ,

(4.15)

where the second equality follows from (3.41). The sum of the ﬁrst two equations in (4.13) tells

us that φ = ϕ + χ is an integration constant for the characteristics, and ﬁnally the last equation
says that ¯V is also constant for characteristics. Thus we learn that the change to background

independent variables is achieved by writing

¯V = ˆV (φ, ˆt ) .

(4.16)

It is straightforward to verify that this solves (4.12). Substituting into either (4.5) or (4.6) gives

the same ﬂow equation:

ˆV + dV ˆV =

∂ˆt

dV

20

(4.17)

which is indeed now background independent, i.e. independent of χ, and indeed independent of
parametrisation f . There remains a dependence on the dimension of f through dV = 2(2 − df )
although this disappears for ˆk-ﬁxed points, and can be removed entirely by a rescaling ˆt (cid:55)→ ˆt dV
which however changes the dimension of ˆk to dV .

We also see from (4.14) and (4.16) that

∂t ¯V = ∂ˆt

ˆV ,

(4.18)

and thus ﬁxed points in k coincide with the background independent ﬁxed points.

Finally, the ﬁxed points are readily found from (4.17) similarly to refs. [19, 21] by recognising

that

d2 ˆV
dφ2 = 1 − 1

(4.19)

is equivalent to Newton’s equation for acceleration with respect to ‘time’ φ of a particle of unit
mass at ‘position’ ˆV in a potential U = − ˆV + (ln ˆV )/6. In this way it can be veriﬁed that there is
a line of ﬁxed points ending at the Gaussian ﬁxed point, which is here ˆV = 1/6, in agreement with

the ﬁndings for power-law cutoﬀ in [19].

5 Polynomial truncations

The analysis so far has used properties of conformally truncated gravity and the derivative expansion

approximation method. In order to gain insight about what might happen at the non-perturbative

level, and in full quantum gravity, we will consider how the issues would become visible in polyno-

mial truncations.

The generic case treated in sec. 4.1 will be just as clear in the sense that truncations of the

Ward identity will still force the eﬀective potential (eﬀective action in general) to be t dependent if

the dimensionless parametrisation (4.3) is similarly forced to be t dependent. In general therefore,

if the way the metric is parametrised forces the parametrisation to become t dependent, we can

expect that background independence excludes the possibility of ﬁxed points, at least with respect

to t.

Consider next the situation treated in sec. 4.2. Expanding the dimensionless potential and the

equations in a double power series in the ﬂuctuation and the background ﬁeld, we write:

¯V ( ¯ϕ, ¯χ) =

anm ¯ϕn ¯χm .

(5.1)

∞(cid:88)

n,m=0

21

Substituting (4.4) into (4.6) and multiplying through by ¯χ, we can read oﬀ from this and (4.5) the

zeroth level equations:

dV a00 =

(cid:19)

1 − 2a20

,

2ρ a00 =

1 − 2a20

.

(5.2)

Since ρ cannot vanish and a20 cannot diverge, combining these equations gives dV = dR +η/2 which

from (3.42) implies η = 0. Thus we recover already from the zeroth order level that ﬁxed points

are excluded unless η = 0. (Of course the real reason, namely that the equations are incompatible,

and the full consequence that there are no t-dependent solutions either, is maybe not so easy to

see this way.)

5.1 Counting argument

We already argued in the Introduction, that generically the coeﬃcients become overconstained if

we consider a suﬃciently high truncation. We now proceed to make a careful count and estimate

the level at which this happens.

We concentrate on ﬁxed point solutions to the LPA system (4.1), (4.2) and (4.3) where either

η = 0 or we choose power-law f , so that explicit t dependence does not already rule out such
¯V ( ¯ϕ, ¯χ). To obtain the system at
solutions. We introduce the short-hand notation ¯V (n,m) = ∂n

¯ϕ∂m
¯χ

order r we have to plug the expansion of the potential (5.1) into both the ﬁxed point equation and

msWI, act on them with operators

∂i+j
∂ ¯ϕi ∂ ¯χj such that i + j = r, before ﬁnally setting the ﬁelds to
zero. In particular, for any ﬁxed value r(cid:63) we have 2 (r(cid:63) + 1) equations and hence up to order r

2 (i + 1) = r2 + 3r + 2

(5.3)

there are

neqn(r) =

To count the coeﬃcients appearing in these neqn(r) equations let us start with the left hand

sides. First note that

¯V (i,j)

∝ aij .

(5.4)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ¯ϕ= ¯χ=0

That is, for any ﬁxed pair (i, j) the left hand side of (4.2) will contain the coeﬃcients aij, ai+1,j

and ai,j+1, whereas the left hand side of (4.1) will only contain aij. Up to some ﬁxed order r there
will be thus coeﬃcients aij where i and j run from 0 to r + 1 and i + j (cid:54) r + 1

Including the coeﬃcients of the right hand side, we have to be careful not to double count any

coeﬃcients that have already been taken account of on the left hand sides. Let us suppose we have

ﬁxed the cutoﬀ and let us assume that for the moment ¯γ = const. Then all additional coeﬃcients

on the right hand side come from the expansion of the propagator

will involve terms ¯V (2,0) ··· ¯V (i+2,0). Using (5.4), we see that the expression given in (5.7) will then

(5.12)

From (5.3) we see that for large r the number of equations ∼ r2, while from (5.12) the number
of coeﬃcients only goes for large r as ∼ r2/2. There are therefore asymptotically twice as many
equations as coeﬃcients, as already discussed in the Introduction. Equating the number of equations

and coeﬃcients yields the positive solution

r = 5.3 .

(5.13)

Therefore the number of equations exceeds the number of coeﬃcients for the ﬁrst time at order

r = 6.

If there is to be a conﬂict between the existence of (k-)ﬁxed points and background

independence generically we would expect this to become evident at about this level. Equally, if

there is no conﬂict between background independence and the existence of (k-)ﬁxed points then

from this level onwards some equations become redundant (i.e. they provide constraints that are

independence.

6 Summary, discussion and conclusions

If we construct the non-perturbative ﬂow equation for quantum gravity by introducing a cutoﬀ

deﬁned through a background metric then independence from this artiﬁcial metric can only be

achieved if the appropriate modiﬁed split Ward identity is obeyed. However even if it is obeyed,
background independence is guaranteed only in the limit k → 0. RG properties on the other hand
are deﬁned at intermediate scales k. There is therefore the potential for conﬂict in this formula-

tion between RG notions such as ﬁxed points, and the requirement of background independence.

Examples of such conﬂicts were uncovered in ref. [16].

Table 1: RG properties of the derivative expansion for conformally truncated gravity, when the

msWI is also satisﬁed. The results depend on whether the conformal factor develops an anomalous

dimension η, on the choice of cutoﬀ proﬁle r, and on how the metric is parametrised via f . De-

pending also on its dimension df , f can contain a massive parameter, and thus run with k when

written in dimensionless terms, as listed in the table. (cid:99)FP indicates that a background-independent

description exists, while (HHFP) FP indicates that k-ﬁxed points are (not) allowed; the (in)equality
shows how these relate to the ˆk-ﬁxed points.

In this paper we have further investigated these issues. Our ﬁndings, together with those of
ref. [16], are summarised in table 1.7 The ﬁrst question that needs to be addressed is whether the
msWI, W = 0, is compatible with the exact RG ﬂow equation, i.e. such that
˙W = 0 then follows.
At the exact level, this latter compatibility is guaranteed since they are both identities derived

from the partition function (see also sec. 3.1). Within the derivative expansion approximation of

conformally truncated gravity considered in ref. [16] (reviewed in sec. 2), we have shown in secs.

3.3 and 3.5, that this compatibility follows if and only if either η = 0 or cutoﬀ proﬁle is power law.

In sec. 3.2, we saw precisely why the derivative expansion breaks compatibility in general and why

these special cases restore it. We argued in sec. 3.4 that if the equations are incompatible they are

overconstrained since there are then an inﬁnite number of secondary constraints, and thus not even

t-dependent solutions can exist. We conﬁrmed this latter conclusion by example in sec. 4.2. In sec.

5, we also saw that the ﬁxed point equations and Ward identities together generically overconstrain

the system when expanded in terms of vertices beyond the six-point level.

Even if the equations are compatible the msWI can still forbid ﬁxed points. In sec. 4.1 the
7For power law cutoﬀ r(z) = z−n, df = 2 − η/(n + 2) is excluded [16], and from sec. 3.5 when η = 0, df = 2 is

excluded for any cutoﬀ proﬁle: in these cases the cutoﬀ term is independent of k.

whenever this dimensionless combination is similarly forced to be t-dependent. For example we

see that ﬁxed points with respect to k are forbidden for exponential parametrisations f (φ) =

exp(φ) if the ﬁeld grows a non-zero anomalous dimension.

It is clear that the reasons for this

conﬂict are general and not tied to the derivative expansion of the conformally truncated model

per se. Therefore this issue could provide important constraints for example on the exponential

parametrisations recently advocated in the literature [38–46].

For full quantum gravity, such conﬂict between k-ﬁxed points and background independence

may also show up clearly in a vertex expansion, as discussed in 5, or generically it may not become

visible until the six-point level. However for full quantum gravity, if we are to follow the standard

procedure, we must also ﬁx the gauge. The original msWI, which formally expresses background

independence before gauge ﬁxing, will no longer be compatible with the ﬂow equation. Instead

we must use the appropriate version which has contributions from the background dependence of

the gauge ﬁxing and ghost terms as well as from cutoﬀ terms for the ghost action itself. However
background independence is then only restored in the limit k → 0 after going “on-shell” (assuming
such an appropriate property can be deﬁned). This last step is required to recover quantities

that are independent of the gauge ﬁxing. If we are to continue with a ﬂow equation for a Legendre

eﬀective action [30,31] then to get around this obstruction, the Vilkovisky-DeWitt covariant eﬀective

action seems called for [17, 47–49], with the msWI replaced by the corresponding modiﬁed Nielsen

identities where the rˆole of the background ﬁeld is played by the “base point” [50].

Returning to the present study, it seems surely signiﬁcant that whenever the msWI equations

are actually compatible with the ﬂow equations, it is possible to combine them and thus uncover
background independent variables, including a background independent notion of scale, ˆk. These

are not only independent of χ but also independent of the parametrisation f . Of course such
an underlying description has only been shown in this O(∂2) approximation and in conformally
truncated gravity, and one might doubt that this happy circumstance could be generalised to full

quantum gravity, and not only for the reasons outlined above. However we also saw in sec. 5.1 that

if modiﬁed Ward identities are to be compatible with the ﬂow equations then in terms of vertices,

27

the information they contain becomes highly redundant at suﬃciently high order (the six-point level

in our case). This in itself suggests the existence of a simpler description. Finally very recently a

formulation for non-perturbative RG has been proposed where computations can be made without

ever introducing a background metric (or gauge ﬁxing) [18].
