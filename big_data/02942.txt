DEFINABLE MAXIMAL COFINITARY GROUPS

VERA FISCHER, SY DAVID FRIEDMAN, AND ASGER T ¨ORNQUIST

Abstract. Using countable support iteration of S-proper posets, for some appropriate stationary
set S, we obtain a generic extension of the constructible universe, in which b = c = ℵ2 and there is
a maximal coﬁnitary group with a Π1

2-deﬁnable set of generators.

1. Introduction

Following standard notation, we denote by S∞ the set of all permutations of the natural numbers.
A function f ∈ S∞ is said to be a coﬁnitary permutation, if it has only ﬁnitely many ﬁxed points.
A subgroup G of S∞ is said to be a coﬁnitary group if each of its non-identity elements has only
ﬁnitely many ﬁxed points, i.e. is a coﬁnitary permutation. A maximal coﬁnitary group, abbreviated
mcg, is a coﬁnitary group, which is maximal with respect to these properties, under inclusion. The
minimal size of a maximal coﬁnitary group is denoted ag. It is known that b ≤ ag (see [6]).

There has been signiﬁcant interest towards the existence of maximal coﬁnitary groups which
are low in the projective hierarchy. The existence of a closed maximal coﬁnitary group is still
open, while S. Gao and Y. Zhang (see [7]) showed that the axiom of constructibility implies the
existence of a maximal coﬁnitary group with a co-analytic generating set. The result was improved
by B. Kastermans, who showed that in the constructible universe L there is a co-analytic maximal
coﬁnitary group (see [6]).

There is little known about the existence of nicely deﬁnable maximal coﬁnitary groups in models

of c > ℵ1. Our main result can be formulated as follows:

Theorem. There is a generic extension of the constructible universe in which b = c = ℵ2 and
there is a maximal coﬁnitary group with a Π1

2-deﬁnable set of generators.

The extension is obtained via a countable support iteration of S-proper posets, for some ap-
propriate stationary set S. Along the iteration coﬁnally often we add generic permutations which
using a ground model set of almost disjoint functions provide codes for themselves. Of use for
this construction is on the one hand the poset for adding a maximal coﬁnitary group of desired
cardinality, developed in [5], and on the other hand the coding techniques of [2] and [4].

The paper is organized as follows:

in section 2 we give an outline of a poset which adjoins a
coﬁnitary permutation to a given co-fnitary group and describe our main coding techniques; section

3 contains a detailed proof of our main theorem and in section 4 we conclude with the discussion
of some remaining open questions.

2. Maximal Cofinitary Groups and Coding

2.1. Adding generic permutations. Our methods for adding a generic permutation are based
on [5], where the ﬁrst and third authors provide a poset which given an arbitrary index set A and
a (freely generated) coﬁnitary group G, generically adjoins a family of permutations {ga}a∈A such
that the group generated by G∪{ga}a∈A is coﬁnitary. We will be interested in the particular case in
which |A| = 1. Following the terminology of [5], given a non-empty set B, a mapping ρ : B → S∞ is
said to induce a coﬁnitary representation if the natural extension of ρ to a mapping ˆρ : FB → S∞,
where FB denotes the free group on the set B, has the property that its image is a coﬁnitary group.
For A 6= ∅, we denote by WA the set of all reduced words on the alphabet A and by cWA the set
of all words on the same alphabet which start and end with a diﬀerent letter, or are a power of a
single letter. We refer to the elements of cWA as good words. Note that every word is a conjugate of
a good word, that is ∀w ∈ WA∃w0 ∈ cWA∃u ∈ WA such that w = uw0u−1. The empty word is not
a good word.

Whenever a is an index, which does not belong to the set B, s is a ﬁnite partial injection from ω
to ω, ρ : B → S∞ is a mapping which induces a coﬁnitary representation and w is a reduced word
on the alphabet {a} ∪ B, we denote by ew[s, ρ] the (partial) function obtained by substituting every
appearance of a letter b from B with ρ(b), and every appearance of the letter a with the partial
mapping s. By deﬁnition, let e∅[s, ρ] be the identity. For the exact recursive deﬁnition see [5]. Note
that if s is injective, then so is ew[s, ρ] (see [5]).

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let B be a non-empty set, a /∈ B and ρ : B → S∞ a mapping which induces
a coﬁnitary representation. The poset Q{a},ρ consists of all pairs (s, F ) where s ∈ <ωω is a ﬁnite
partial injection, F is a ﬁnite set of words in cW{a}∪B. The extension relation states that (t, H) ≤
(s, F ) if and only if t end-extends s, F ⊆ H and ∀w ∈ F ∀n ∈ ω if ew[t, ρ](n) = n then ew[s, ρ](n)
is already deﬁned (and so ew[s, ρ](n) = n).

Recall that a poset P is said to be σ-centered, if P = Sn∈ω Pn where for each n, Pn is centered,
that is whenever p, q are conditions in Pn then there is r ∈ Pn which is their common extension.
Note that Q{a},ρ is σ-centered. If G is Q{a},ρ-generic, then g = S{s : ∃F (s, F ) ∈ G} is a coﬁnitary
permutation such that the mapping ρG : {a} ∪ B → S∞ deﬁned by ρG(a) = g and ρG↾B = ρ,
induces a coﬁnitary representation in V [G]. For the proofs of both of these statements see [5].

2.2. Coding with a ground model almost disjoint family of functions. We work over the
constructible universe L. Recall that a ZF− model M is said to be suitable iﬀ

M (cid:15) (ω2 exists and ω2 = ωL

2 ).

In our construction, we will use a family F = {fhζ,ξi : ζ ∈ ω · 2, ξ ∈ ω1
bijective functions such that F ∩ M = {fhζ,ξi : ζ ∈ ω · 2, ξ ∈ (ωL
of ZF − (see [4, Proposition 3]).

L} ∈ L of almost disjoint
1 )M } for every transitive model M

For our purposes, we will need the following Lemma, which is analogous to [4, Proposition 4].

Lemma 2.2. There is a sequence ¯S = hSβ : β < ω2i of almost disjoint stationary subsets of ω1,
which is Σ1 deﬁnable over Lω2 with parameter ω1, and whenever M, N are suitable models of ZF −
such that ωM

1 , then ¯SM agrees with ¯SN on ωM

2 ∩ ωN
2 .

1 = ωN

Proof. Let hDγ : γ < ω1i be the canonical Lω1 deﬁnable ♦ sequence (see [1]) and for each α < ω2
let Aα be the L-least subset of ω1 coding α. Now, let Sα := {i < ω1 : Di = Aα ∩ i}.
(cid:3)

Let ¯S be as in the preceding Lemma and let S be a stationary subset of ω1 which is almost
disjoint from every element of ¯S. We will use the following coding of an ordinal α < ω2 by a subset
of ω1 (see [4, Fact 5]).

Lemma 2.3. There is a formula φ(x, y) and for every α < ωL

2 a set Xα ∈ ([ω1]ω1)L such that

1 , φ(x, Xα ∩ ωM
• for every suitable model M containing Xα ∩ ωM

2-definable set of generators

In this section we will provide a generic extension of the constructible universe L in which
b = c = ℵ2 and there is a maximal coﬁnitary group with a Π1
2-deﬁnable set of generators. Fix a
recursive bijection ψ : ω × ω → ω. Recursively deﬁne a countable support iteration of S-proper
posets hPα, ˙Qβ : α ≤ ω2, β < ω2i as follows. If α < ω1 let ˙Qα be a Pα-name for Hechler forcing for
adding a dominating real.1 Suppose Pα has been deﬁned and

• for every β ∈ Lim(α\ω1) the poset Qβ adds a coﬁnitary permutation gβ, and
• the mapping ρβ : Lim(α\ω1) → S∞ where ρα(β) = gβ induces a coﬁnitary representation.
In LPα deﬁne Qα as follows. If α is a successor , then Qα is a Pα-name for Hechler forcing for
adding a dominating real. If α ≥ ω1 is a limit, then α = ω1 · ν + ω · η for some ν 6= 0, ν < ω2,
η < ω1 and the conditions of Qα are pairs hhs, F, s∗i, hck, ykik∈ωi where

(1) (s, F ) ∈ Q{α},ρα;
(2) ∀k ∈ ω, ck is a closed bounded subset of ω1\η such that ck ∩ Sα+k = ∅;
(3) ∀k ∈ ω, yk is a 0, 1-valued function whose domain |yk| is a countable limit ordinal, such
that η ≤ |yk|, yk↾η = 0 and for every γ such that η ≤ γ < |yk|, yk(2γ) = 1 if and only if
γ ∈ η + Xα = {η + µ : µ ∈ Xα};

(4) for every k ∈ ψ[s] and every countable suitable model M of ZF − such that ξ = ωM

1 ≤ |yk|,

ξ is a limit point of ck and yk↾ξ, ck ∩ ξ are elements of M , we have that

M (cid:15) yk↾ξ codes a limit ordinal ¯α such that S ¯α+k is non-stationary.

(5) s∗ is a ﬁnite subset of {fm,ξ : m ∈ ψ[s], ξ ∈ cm} ∪ {fω+m,ξ : m ∈ ψ[s], ym(ξ) = 1}.

The extension relation states that ¯q = hht, H, t∗i, hdk, zkik∈ωi extends ¯p = hhs, F, s∗i, hck, ykik∈ωi iﬀ

(1) (t, H) ≤Q{α},ρα
(s, F ),
(2) ∀f ∈ s∗, t\s ∩ f = ∅,

1For bookkeeping reasons it is more convenient to introduce the generators of the maximal coﬁnitary group at

limit stages greater or equal ω1.

(3) ∀k ∈ ψ[s], dk end-extends ck and yk ⊆ zk
With this the recursive deﬁnition of Pω2 is complete. If ¯p ∈ Qα, where ¯p = hhs, F, s∗i, hck, ykik∈ωi

we write ﬁn(¯p) for hs, F, s∗i and inf(¯p) for hck, ykik∈ω. In particular ﬁn(¯p)0 = s.

Lemma 3.1. For every condition ¯p = hhs, F, s∗i, hck, ykik∈ωi ∈ Qα and every γ ∈ ω1 there exists
a sequence hdk, zkik∈ω such that ¯q = hhs, F, s∗i, hdk, zkik∈ωi ∈ Qα, ¯q ≤ ¯p and for all k ∈ ω we have
that |zk|, max dk ≥ γ.

Proof. As in [2, Lemma 1.1].

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.2. For every p ∈ Qα and every dense open set D ⊆ Qα, there is q ≤ p such that
ﬁn(q) = ﬁn(p) and for every p1 ∈ D, p1 ≤ q there is p2 ∈ D, p2 ≤ q such that ﬁn(p2)0 = ﬁn(p1)0
and inf(p2) = inf(q).

k, z0

0i, hd0

Proof. Let p = hht0, F0, t∗
kik∈ωi. Let M be a countable elementary submodel of LΘ, for
Θ a suﬃciently large regular cardinal, which contains Qα, ¯p, Xα, D as elements and such that
j = M ∩ ω1 /∈ Sk∈ψ[t0] Sα+k. Let h¯rn, snin∈ω enumerate all pairs h¯rn, sni where ¯rn ∈ Qα ∩ M, sn
is a ﬁnite partial injective function from ω to ω and each pair is enumerated coﬁnally often. Let
{jn}n∈ω be an increasing sequence which is coﬁnal in j. Inductively we will construct a decreasing
sequence h¯pnin∈ω ⊆ Q ∩ M such that for all n, ﬁn(¯pn) = ﬁn(¯p).

Let ¯p0 = ¯p. Suppose ¯pn has been deﬁned. If there is ¯r1,n ∈ M ∩ Q such that ¯r1,n ≤ ¯pn, ¯rn
ik∈ω in M in such a way that
ik∈ωi. If there
ik∈ω in M such that for all k ∈ ω,

and ﬁn(¯r1,n) = sn then extend inf(¯r1,n) to a sequence hdn+1
for all k ∈ ω, max dn+1

¯α+k = π(Sα+k) = Sα+k ∩ j. Since ω ¯M

We will show that q is indeed a condition. For this we only need to verify part (4) of being a
condition, since the other clauses are clear. Fix k ∈ ψ[t0]. Let M0 be a countable suitable model of
ZF − such that ωM0
1 = j and zk, dk are elements of M0. Let ¯M be the Mostowski collapse of the
model M and let π : M → ¯M be the corresponding isomorphism. Note that j = ω1 ∩ M = ω ¯M
1 .
Since Xα ∈ M and M is an elementary submodel of LΘ, α is the unique solution of φ(x, Xα)
in M. Therefore ¯α = π(α) is the unique solution of φ(x, Xα ∩ j) = φ(x, π(Xα)) in ¯M. Note
also that S ¯M
and Xα ∩ j ∈ ¯M ∩ M0, the solutions
of φ(x, Xα ∩ j) in ¯M and M0 coincide. That is, the solution of φ(x, Xα ∩ j) in M0 is ¯α. By
the properties of the sequence of stationary sets which we ﬁxed in the ground model, we have
¯α+k = S ¯M

α+k) = Sα+k ∩ j. Since dk ∈ M0 and dk is unbounded in j, we obtain that

¯α+k is not stationary in M0. Therefore q is indeed a condition.
Consider an arbitrary extension p1 = hﬁn(p1), inf(p1)i of ¯q from the dense open set D and let
ﬁn(p1)0 = r1. Then hr1, F0, t∗
k ik∈ωi ∈ Qα ∩ M.
Then there is some n ≥ m such that sn = r1, ¯rn = ¯r∗. Note that p1 ≤ q, ¯rn and so p1 is a common
extension of ¯pn, ¯rn. By elementarity there is ¯r1,n ∈ M ∩ D which is a common extension of ¯pn,
¯rn, such that ﬁn(¯r1,n) = hr1 = sn, F2, r∗
2i, hdk, zkik∈ωi. Note that inf(¯pn+1)
extends inf(¯r1,n) and so p2 ≤ ¯r1,n, which implies that p2 ∈ D. Clearly p2 ≤ q and so p2 is as
desired.

Lemma 3.3. Let M be a countable elementary submodel of LΘ for suﬃciently large Θ containing
all relevant parameters, i = M ∩ ω1, ¯p = hhs, F, s∗i, hd0
kik∈ωi an element of M ∩ Qα. If i /∈
Sk∈ψ[s] Sα+k, then there exists an (M, Qα)-generic condition ¯q ≤ ¯p such that ﬁn(¯q) = ﬁn(¯p).
Proof. Let {Dn}n∈ω be an enumeration of all dense open subsets of Qα from M and let {in}n∈ω be
an increasing sequence which is coﬁnal in i. Inductively, construct a sequence h¯qnin∈ω ⊆ M ∩ Qα

from Lemma 3.2. Then ¯q ≤ ¯p and we will show that ¯q is (M, Qα)-generic. For this it is suﬃcient
to show that for every n ∈ ω, the set Dn ∩ M is predense below ¯q. Thus ﬁx some n ∈ ω and

Corollary 3.4. For every α < ω2, the poset Qα is S-proper. Consequently, Pω2 is S-proper and
hence preserves cardinals. More precisely, for every condition ¯p = hhs, F, s∗i, hck, ykik∈ωii ∈ Q1
α the
poset {¯r ∈ Qα : ¯r ≤ ¯p} is ω1\Sn∈ψ[s] Sα+n-proper.
3.1. Properties of Q = Qα. Throughout the subsection, let α be a limit ordinal such that ω1 ≤
α < ω2. We study the properties of Q := Qα in LPα.

Claim 3.5 (Domain Extension). For every condition ¯p = hhs, F, s∗i, hcm, ymim∈ωi, natural number
n such that n /∈ dom(s) there are co-ﬁnitely many m ∈ ω such that hhs∪{(n, m)}, F, s∗i, hcm, ymim∈ωi
is a condition extending ¯p.

Proof. Fix ¯p, n as above. By [5, Lemma 2.7] there is a co-ﬁnite set I such that for all m ∈ I
(s, F ). Since s∗ is ﬁnite, we can deﬁne N0 = max{f (n) : n ∈ s∗}. Then
(s ∪ {(n, m)}, F ) ≤Q{α},ρα
for every m ∈ I\N0,

hhs ∪ {(n, m)}, F, s∗i, hck, ykik∈ωi ≤ ¯p.

(cid:3)

Claim 3.6 (Range Extension). For any condition ¯p = hhs, F, s∗i, hcm, ymim∈ωi, natural number
m /∈ ran(s) there are co-ﬁnitely many n ∈ ω such that hhs ∪ {(n, m)}, F, s∗i, hck, ykik∈ωi is a
condition, extending ¯p.

Proof. Fix ¯p, m as above. By [5, Lemma 2.7] there is a co-ﬁnite set I such that for all n ∈ I,
(s ∪ {(n, m)}, F ) ≤Q{α},ρα
(s, F ). Now for every n, consider the set An = {f (n)}f ∈s∗ . If there are
inﬁnitely many n such that m ∈ An then ∃f ∈ s∗∃∞n such that f (n) = m, which is a contradiction
to f being a bijection. That is ∀∞n(m /∈ An). Choose N such that ∀n ≥ N (m /∈ An). Then
∀n ∈ I\N (hhs ∪ {(n, m)}, F, s∗i, hck, ykik∈ωi) is an extension of ¯p with the desired properties. (cid:3)

The following claim is straightforward.

Claim 3.7. For every w0 ∈ cW{α}∪Lim(α\ω1) the set Dw0 = {¯p ∈ Q : w0 ∈ ﬁn(¯p)1} is dense.
Claim 3.8. Suppose ¯q = hhs, F, s∗i, hck, ykik∈ωi (cid:13)Qα ew[ρG](n) = n for some w ∈ cW{α}∪Lim(α\ω1).
Then ew[s, ρα](n) is deﬁned and ew[s, ρα](n) = n.

Proof. Let G be Qα generic over LPα such that q ∈ G. By deﬁnition of the extension relation
there is a condition ¯r = hht, H, t∗i, hdk, zkik∈ωi in G such that ew[ρG](n) = ew[t, ρα](n) = n. Then
(t, H) ≤Q{α},ρα
(s, F ) and since the extension of Q{α},ρα does not allow new ﬁxed points we obtain
ew[s, ρα](n) = n.
(cid:3)
Lemma 3.9. Let G be Qα-generic over LPα and let gα = S¯p∈G ﬁn(¯p)0. Then gα is a coﬁnitary
permutation and hgβiβ≤α is a coﬁnitary group.

Proof. Since for every n, m in ω, the sets Dn = {¯p ∈ Q : n ∈ dom(ﬁn(¯p)0)}, Rm = {¯p ∈ Q, m ∈
ran(ﬁn(¯p)0)} are dense, it is easy to see than g = gα is a surjective function. Injectivity follows
directly from the properties of Q{α},ρα (see [5]), and so g is a permutation.

We will show that the group generated by {gβ}β∈Lim(α\ω1) ∪ {gα} is a coﬁnitary group. Fix an
arbitrary word w ∈ W{α}∪Lim(α\ω1). Then there are w′ ∈ cW{α}∪Lim(α\ω1) and u ∈ W{α}∪Lim(α\ω1)
such that w = u−1w′u. Since Dw′ is dense, there is a condition ¯p = hhs, F, s∗i, hck, ykik∈ωi in G such
that w′ ∈ F . Suppose ew′[ρG](n) = n. Then there is ¯q ∈ G, ¯q ≤ ¯p such that ¯q (cid:13) ew′[ρG](n) = n.
By the above Lemma, ew′[t, ρα](n) = n, where ¯q = h(t, F ′, t∗), hdk, zkik∈ωi and so by the extension
relation ew′[s, ρα](n) = n. Then ﬁx(ew′[ρG]) = ﬁx(ew′[s, ρα]) which is ﬁnite and so ﬁx(ew[ρG]) is
also ﬁnite.
(cid:3)

Lemma 3.10 (Generic Hitting). In LPα suppose h{h} ∪ {gβ }β<αi is a coﬁnitary group and h is not
covered by ﬁnitely many members of F with indices above η. Then LPα+1 (cid:15) ∃∞n ∈ ω(gα(n) = h(n)).

Proof. We claim that for every N ∈ ω, the set DN = {¯q : ∃n ≥ N (s(n) = h(n))} is dense in Qα.
Let ¯p = hhs, F, s∗i, hck, ykik∈ωi be an arbitrary condition. By [5, Lemma 2.19] there is N such that
for all n ≥ N ,

Since h is not covered by the members of s∗, we have that ∃∞n such that h(n) /∈ {f (n)}f ∈s∗ .
Denote this set Ih(¯p). Let n ∈ Ih(¯p)\ max{N¯p, N }. Then

(s ∪ {(n, h(n))}, F ) ≤Q{α},ρα

(s, F ).

¯q := hhs ∪ {(n, h(n))}, F, s∗i, hck, ykik∈ωi ≤ ¯p

and ¯q ∈ DN . Therefore LPα+1 (cid:15) ∃∞n(gα(n) = h(n)).

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.11. The group G := hgαiα∈Lim(ω2\ω1) added by Pω2 is a maximal coﬁnitary group.

Proof. Suppose G is not maximal. Then there is a coﬁnitary permutation h such that

h{gα}α∈Lim(ω2\ω1) ∪ {h}i

is coﬁnitary. Let α < ω2 be the least limit ordinal such that α = ω1 · ξ for some ξ 6= 0 and such
that h ∈ LPα. Then there is η ≥ 0 such that h is not covered by ﬁnitely many members of F
whose second index is above η. Therefore by the Generic Hitting Lemma the poset Qω1·ξ+ω·η adds
a generic permutation gω1·ξ+ω·η which is inﬁnitely often equal to h, which is a contradiction.

3.2. Coding. Let Gα be Qα-generic ﬁlter over LPα and let gα := S¯p∈G ﬁn(¯p)0. For every k ∈ ψ[gα]

• S∗ = {fhm,ξi : m ∈ ψ[gα], ξ ∈ C α
• If m ∈ ψ[gα] then dom(Y α
• If m ∈ ψ[gα] then |gα ∩ fhm,ξi| < ω if and only if ξ ∈ C α

• If m ∈ ψ[gα] then |gα ∩ fhω+m,ξi| < ω if and only if Y α

m} ∪ {fhω+m,ξi : m ∈ ψ[gα], Y α

m(ξ) = 1.

m(ξ) = 1}.

m is a club in ω1 disjoint from Sα+m.

Corollary 3.13. Let n ∈ ω\ψ[gα]. Then Sα+n remains stationary in LPω2 .

Proof. Let G be Pω2-generic over L and let p ∈ G such that p (cid:13) β /∈ {α + n : n ∈ ψ[gα]}. Then G
is also Pω2(p)-generic, where Pω2(p) := {q : q ≤ p} is the countable support iteration of Qγ(p(γ))
for γ < ω2. However for every γ, the poset Qγ(p(γ)) is Sβ-proper and so the entire iteration is
Sβ-proper.

countable suitable model M of ZF − containing g as an element there exists a limit ordinal ¯α < ωM

¯α+k is non-stationary in M for all k ∈ ψ[g].

Proof. The proof is analogous to that of [4, Lemma 13]. Let g ∈ A. Find α < ω2 such that g = gα,
and let M be a countable suitable model containing g as an element. Then C α
1 are
elements of M for all k ∈ ψ[gα]. Fix any m ∈ ψ[gα]. Then there is ¯p = hhs, F, s∗i, hck, ykik∈ωi ∈ G
such that m ∈ ψ[s] and C α
1 = ym. By deﬁnition of being a condition we
obtain that

1 = cm, Y α

codes a limit ordinal ¯αm such that S ¯αm+m is not stationary.

Note that for every distinct m1, m2 in ψ[gα] we have that Y α
not depend on m.

1 = Y α

1 , and so ¯αm does

such that SM

To see the other implication, ﬁx g such that for every countable suitable model containing g
as an element there exists ¯α < ωM
¯α+k is non-stationary in M for all k ∈ ψ[g]. By
2
the L¨owenheim-Skolem theorem the same holds for arbitrary suitable models of ZF − containing
g.
In particular this holds in M = LΘ[G] for some suﬃciently large Θ, say Θ > ω100. Then
2 = ωL[G]
2 , ¯SM = ¯S, and the notions of stationarity of subsets of ω1 coincide in M and
ωM
L[G]. Thus there is a limit ordinal α < ω2 such that Sα+k is non-stationary for all k ∈ ψ[g]. By the
above corollary for every β /∈ {α + k : k ∈ ψ[gα]} the set Sβ is stationary. Therefore ψ[g] ⊆ ψ[gα]
and so g = gα.

Thus as the right-hand side of the equivalence stated in Lemma 3.14 is Π1

2, we obtain:

Theorem 3.15. There is a generic extension of the constructible universe in which b = c = ℵ2
and there is a maximal coﬁnitary group with a Π1

2-deﬁnable set of generators.

4. Remarks

We expect that the techniques of [3] can be modiﬁed to produce a generic extension of the
constructible universe in which b = c = ℵ3 and there is a maximal coﬁnitary group with a Π1
2-
deﬁnable set of generators. Of interest remains the following question: Is it consistent that there
is a Π1

2 deﬁnable maximal coﬁnitary group and b = c = ℵ2?
