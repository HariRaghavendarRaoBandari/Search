Abstract: We study the equilibrium and near-equilibrium properties of a holographic ﬁve-dimensional
model consisting of Einstein gravity coupled to a scalar ﬁeld with a non-trivial potential. The dual four-
dimensional gauge theory is not conformal and, at zero temperature, exhibits a renormalisation group
ﬂow between two diﬀerent ﬁxed points. We quantify the deviations from conformality both in terms of
thermodynamic observables and in terms of the bulk viscosity of the theory. By computing the quasi-
normal modes of the system we identify two diﬀerent relaxation channels. At high temperatures, the
system ﬁrst isotropises, meaning that all pressures become equal, and subsequently equilibrates, meaning
that the equation of state becomes applicable. At low temperatures the order of these two processes is
reversed.

Introduction

The understanding of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of matter is an important challenge ubiquitous at
all energy scales. A particularly interesting case is the understanding of these dynamics in strongly coupled
systems. Examples include strongly correlated electrons, cold atoms and the small drops of Quark-Gluon
Plasma (QGP) formed in relativistic colliders such as RHIC or the LHC. The latter case motivates the
study of the relaxation process in strongly coupled non-abelian ﬁeld theories. The gauge/string duality
provides a fascinating tool to address this problem in a wide range of theories.

The duality has already provided insights into the dynamics of strongly coupled, deconﬁned, non-
abelian matter of relevance for the heavy ions programme (see e.g. [1] and references therein). The study
of the oﬀ-equlibrium dynamics of Conformal Field Theories (CFT), most notably N = 4 super Yang-Mills
(SYM) theory, has shown that hydrodynamics is a much better approximation to the evolution of this type
of matter than ever thought before. Indeed, examples based in ﬂow motions imposed by symmetries [2, 3]
or by explicit simulations of the collision dynamics [4–7] have shown that hydrodynamics provides a good
approximation to the complete evolution of the system at time and distance scales as small as a fraction of
the (local) inverse temperature of the system. This occurs even in situations in which gradient corrections
to the hydrodynamic stress tensor are large, extending the applicability beyond a simple gradient expansion
(see also [8]). This observation has led to the coining of the term “hydrodynamisation” to refer to the process
by which a system comes to be well described by hydrodynamics, in order to diﬀerentiate this process from
(local) thermalisation. This observation, ﬁrst made in holographic computations, has now been noted in
Boltzmann equation-based analysis of out-of-equilibrium dynamics, when the strength of the coupling in the
collision kernel is extrapolated to large values [9]. The success of hydrodynamics to capture the evolution
of out-of-equilibrium matter may be at the origin of the strong collective behaviour observed in very small
systems, such as Au-Au collisions at RHIC [10–12], Pb-Pb [13–16], p-Pb [17–19] and p-p [20] collisions at
the LHC. The holographic analysis of collisions of small systems [21, 22] supports this viewpoint.

The applicability of the gauge/string duality is not restricted to CFTs. By now inﬁnite families of
non-conformal examples are known. One of the main new features in these theories as compared to their
conformal cousins is that new channels exist for the relaxation of the out-of-equilibrium matter. Indeed, in
a CFT the vanishing of the trace of the stress tensor implies that the equation of state, namely the relation
between the energy density and the (average) pressure, is ﬁxed by symmetry. As a consequence, the
equation of state is always obeyed both in and out of equilibrium. In contrast, in non-conformal theories
the equation of state is not ﬁxed by symmetry and it is in general not obeyed out of equilibrium. The
relaxation towards equilibrium in these theories therefore involves the evolution of the energy density and
the pressures towards asymptotic values obeying the equation of state. This relaxation channel is absent in
CFTs.

Another important motivation for studying non-conformal theories is the connection with hot Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD) and heavy ion collisions. As is well known, QCD is a non-conformal theory even
in the limit of vanishing quark masses. State-of-the-art determinations of the QCD equation of state via

– 1 –

lattice QCD [23, 24] show that, in equilibrium, the trace of the stress tensor normalised by the enthalpy
attains values of order one close to the QCD transition. At high temperature this ratio quickly approaches
zero, indicating that QCD behaves as an almost-conformal theory in this regime. However, the experimental
exploration of the QCD phase diagram via high-energy heavy ion collisions can only reach temperatures
a few times larger than the critical temperature. Even though most central, top-energy LHC collisions
lead to initial temperatures well into the quasi-conformal regime, the subsequent evolution and cooling of
the QGP after production spans all temperature regimes, including those in which non-conformal eﬀects
are maximal. In fact, recent attempts for high-precision extraction of the shear viscosity of the QGP have
highlighted the need to include the bulk viscosity of the plasma, which is a purely non-conformal eﬀect
[25]. Furthermore, oﬀ-central collisions both at the LHC and RHIC, as well as lower-energy collisions as
those explored at the RHIC energy scan, produce a QGP with a smaller initial temperature. Similarly the
apparent success of hydrodynamics in smaller systems such as p-Pb [26] and p-p [27, 28] collisions indicate
the need to study the properties of deconﬁned but cooler QCD plasma, where non-conformal eﬀects become
signiﬁcant (see [29] and references therein for a recent review on the hydrodynamic modelling of heavy ion
collisions).

In order to study non-conformal theories in a holographic setup we will consider a ﬁve-dimensional
bottom-up model that nevertheless shares many qualitative features with top-down string models. Specif-
ically, our model is dual to a four-dimensional gauge theory that, at zero temperature, ﬂows from an
ultraviolet (UV) ﬁxed point to an infrared (IR) ﬁxed point. This renormalisation group (RG) ﬂow is dual
on the gravity side to a domain-wall geometry that interpolates between two AdS spaces. The reason
why we require that the ﬂow approaches a ﬁxed point in the UV is that this is the situation in which the
holographic duality is best understood. The reason for the IR ﬁxed point is that this guarantees that the
zero-temperature solution is smooth in the deep IR. The ﬂow is triggered by a source Λ for a relevant,
dimension-three operator in the UV. We will see that this simple model exhibits a rich phenomenology. In
particular, the dominant channel for relaxation at non-zero temperature depends on the value of the ratio
T /Λ. At small T /Λ the system ﬁrst equilibrates, meaning that the equilibrium equation of state begins
to hold approximately, and subsequently isotropises, meaning that all the pressures become approximately
equal. In contrast, at large T /Λ the order in which these two processes take place is reversed.

Previous analysis addressing the near-equilibrium properties of strongly coupled non-abelian plasmas
include [30–36]. In particular, the last reference in this list appeared while this paper was being typeset
and has some overlap with our observations concerning the diﬀerent relaxation channels.

This paper is organised as follows.

In Sec. 2 we introduce the holographic model and discuss its
vacuum properties. In Sec. 3 we study black brane solutions and extract from them the equation of state
and the viscosities of the model. In Sec. 4 we study the relaxation of small excitations of the system by
computing the quasi-normal mode (QNM) spectrum of the black branes at diﬀerent temperatures and zero
spatial momentum. Finally, in Sec. 5 we discuss our main ﬁndings and place them in the context of the
hydrodynamisation of non-abelian plasmas.

2 A non-conformal holographic model

The holographic model that we will consider consists of ﬁve-dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to a scalar
ﬁeld with a non-trivial potential:

where κ5 is the ﬁve-dimensional Newton constant. For speciﬁc forms of V (φ), this action may be viewed as
a consistent truncation of ﬁve-dimensional N = 8 supergravity. In this paper we will consider a bottom-up
model by choosing a potential that is particularly simple and yet shares some of the qualitative properties
of these top-down potentials. In particular, we will choose V (φ) to be negative and to possess a maximum
at φ = 0 and a minimum at φ = φM > 0. Each of these extrema yields an AdS solution of the equations
of motion with constant φ and radius L2 = −3/V . In the gauge theory each of these solutions is dual to a
ﬁxed point of the RG with a number of degrees of freedom N 2 proportional to L3/κ2

5.1

1In the case of N = 4 SYM the precise relation would be L3/κ2

5 = N 2/4π2.

– 2 –

We will be interested in domain-wall solutions interpolating between these two AdS solutions. In the
gauge theory, these are dual to RG ﬂows from the UV ﬁxed point at φ = 0 to the IR ﬁxed point at φ = φM .
The problem of ﬁnding those solutions is signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed if the potential can be written globally in
terms of a superpotential, W , as

In this case, vacuum solutions to the Einstein equations can be easily found. Parametrizing the metric as

Note that both the superpotential and the potential have a maximum at φ = 0 and a minimum at φ = φM .
This choice leads to three important properties of the associated vacuum solution. First, the resulting
geometry is asymptotically AdS5 in the UV with radius L, since V (0) = −3/L2. Second, the second
derivative of the potential at φ = 0 implies that, in this asymptotic region, the scalar ﬁeld has mass
m2 = −3/L2. Following the standard quantisation analysis, this means that, in the UV, this ﬁeld is dual
to an operator in the gauge theory, O, with dimension ∆UV = 3. Third, the solution near φ = φM is again
AdS5 with a diﬀerent radius

To summarize, the vacuum solution describes a RG ﬂow from an UV to an IR ﬁxed point with a smaller
number of degrees of freedom, as indicated by the fact that LIR < L. We see that changing φM has two main
eﬀects. First, as φM increases the diﬀerence in degrees of freedom between the UV and the IR ﬁxed points
increases. Second, the dimension of the scalar operator at the IR ﬁxed point decreases with increasing φM ,
reaching the marginal dimension ∆IR = 4 at φM → ∞. However, in this limiting case the IR ﬁxed point
disappears and the background solution becomes singular, as is evident from the fact that the eﬀective AdS
radius goes to zero as φM → ∞.

Our simple choice of the superpotential allows us to determine analytically the vacuum solution for

arbitrary φM . Solving eq. (2.4), we obtain

where φ0 is an arbitrary constant that controls the magnitude of the non-normalizable mode of the scalar
ﬁeld. As we will see, in the dual gauge theory side, φ0 is related to the source Λ of the dimension-3 operator
O through Λ = φ0/L. The presence of this source breaks conformal invariance explicitly.

Noticing that the small ﬁeld behaviour of the superpotential eq. (2.5) is identical to that of the GPPZ
ﬂow [38], we can readily determine the vacuum expectation values (VEV) of the stress tensor and the scalar
operator. We begin by expanding the metric and the scalar ﬁeld in powers of u = e−r/L in the u → 0 limit.
Following [37], we write the 5-dimensional metric in the form

and we write the power expansion coeﬃcients of the metric and the scalar ﬁeld as

ds2 =

To arrive at these expressions we have chosen the superpotential as a counterterm to regularise the on-shell
action, which is possible because in our model the superpotential corresponds to a deformation of the gauge
theory as opposed to a VEV [39]. We emphasize that these expressions are valid even if the metric gµν
does not posses the full Poincaré symmetry but only rotational and translational invariance along the gauge
theory directions, as will be the case for the black brane geometries that we will study in the next section.
As expected, eqs. (2.15) and (2.16) imply the Ward identity for the trace of the stress tensor

(cid:10)T µ

µ

(cid:11) = −Λ(cid:104)O(cid:105) .

Eqs. (2.10) and (2.11) determine the VEVs in the vacuum of the theory. Let us deﬁne the energy
density  and the pressure p as the diagonal components of the expectation value of the stress tensor,
(cid:104)T µν(cid:105) = Diagonal{, p, p, p}. The near boundary behaviour of φ, eq. (2.11), leads to

which implies that in the vacuum

(cid:104)O(cid:105) = 0,

(cid:104)T µν(cid:105) = 0 .

(2.18)

(2.19)

where we have used that the source Λ = φ0/L. Note that the explicit breaking of scale invariance means
that the trace of the stress tensor is non-zero as an operator. However, the VEV of this operator vanishes
in the vacuum state, as implied by trace Ward identity (2.17) together with the fact that (cid:104)O(cid:105) = 0 in the
vacuum for our choice of renormalisation scheme. It should be emphasized that even though the trace Ward
identity (2.17) is scheme-independent, the individual vacuum expectation values of the trace of the stress
tensor and of the scalar operator do depend on the renormalisation scheme. In the model we study here
the only scheme ambiguity corresponds to a term of the form φ4
0 ηµν in the expectation value of the stress
0 in the expectation value of O, with the relative coeﬃcient
tensor, accompanied by a term of the form φ3
such that (2.17) is preserved.

To estimate at which scale non-conformal eﬀects become important, let us perform a change of variables
in the holographic direction, which explicitly exploits the relation between the dynamics in the bulk with
the physics at diﬀerent scales in the ﬁeld theory. Denoting the coordinate by z, we write the metric as

(cid:0)−dt2 + dx2 + dz2(cid:1) ,

with Leﬀ a non-trivial function of z such that Leﬀ (0) = L and Leﬀ (∞) = LIR. In this set of coordinates,
at least in the two asymptotic conformal regions, the coordinate z is related to the energy scale, Q, in the
gauge theory through z ∼ 1/Q. The relation between z and u is given by

(2.22)

In Fig. 1 we show the ratio Leﬀ /L as a function of z for several diﬀerent values of the parameter φM
controlling the physics of the model. We see that the system behaves approximately conformally up to
scales of order z ∼ Λ. At this scale, the metric starts to deviate signiﬁcantly from that of AdS5, and Leﬀ
decreases as a function of z. Suﬃciently deep in the IR, Leﬀ approaches LIR and the system behaves again
as approximately conformal. However, the scale at which this transition occurs depends signiﬁcantly on
the model parameter φM ; as φM increases, the function Leﬀ approaches its asymptotic value more slowly.
This diﬀerent rates at which the IR ﬁxed point is approached have consequences for the ﬁnite-temperature
behaviour of the dual gauge theory, as we will see in the next section.

3 Thermodynamics and transport

We will now explore the thermal physics of the gauge theory dual to the gravitational model described in
the previous section. To do so, we will search for black brane solutions of the action (2.1). We will follow

[40], to which we refer the reader for details.2 Since
for the background solution (2.11) the scalar ﬁeld is a monotonic function of u, we may use the scalar ﬁeld
as a coordinate and express the metric as

ds2 = e2A(cid:0)−h(φ)dτ 2 + dx2(cid:1) − 2eA+BL dτ dφ ,

with h(φ) vanishing at φ = φH, the value of the scalar ﬁeld at the horizon, i.e. h(φH ) = 0. The region
outside the horizon corresponds to 0 < φ < φH. For later convenience, we have expressed the metric in
Eddington-Finkelstein form. With this ansatz, Einstein’s equations take the form

In these expressions, the constants of integration are ﬁxed by requiring that, close to the boundary, the

with that of a relativistic conformal theory and scale as T 3. In particular, for a relativistic CFT, s/T 3 is
proportional to the number of degrees of freedom in the theory, which for an SU (N ) gauge theory with
matter in the adjoint representation scales as N 2. For example, for N = 4 SYM

but the precise coeﬃcient depends on the speciﬁc theory. In terms of the parameters of the dual gravity
description this quantity becomes

In our bottom-up setup, the above argument allows us to deﬁne the number of degrees of freedom at the
ﬁxed points holographically in terms of the eﬀective AdS radius.
In particular, the quantity sR should
approach 1 at high temperature and (LIR/L)3 at low temperature, which is conﬁrmed by the plots in
Fig. 2.

Using standard thermodynamic relations and the fact that in our renormalisation scheme the vacuum

pressure is zero we can determine the pressure and the energy density of the thermal system through

p =

d ˜T s( ˜T ) ,

 + p = T s .

Since the theory is not conformal, the trace of the stress tensor in the thermal ensemble does not vanish.

The thermal expectation value (cid:104)O(cid:105)T may be determined from the normalisable mode of the scalar ﬁeld
in the thermal background via eq. (2.14). Since at T = 0 the scalar VEV vanishes (see eq. (2.19)) this
relation implies that  = 3p, as expected from the fact that the IR theory is conformal. At T > 0, however,
(cid:104)O(cid:105)T (cid:54)= 0, as shown in Fig. 3, and the expectation value of the trace of the stress tensor does not vanish.
Note that, unlike at low temperatures, at which (cid:104)O(cid:105)T depends on φM , at high temperatures (cid:104)O(cid:105)T becomes
independent of φM . This is easy to understand from the gravitational computation. At high temperatures
the value of the scalar ﬁeld at the horizon is small and, therefore, the physics is sensitive only to the small-
ﬁeld behaviour of the scalar potential, which is independent of φM . In this limit, the plots in Fig. 3 show
that the VEV scales as (cid:104)O(cid:105)T ∼ ΛT 2.

Despite the fact that the trace of the stress tensor at high temperature does not vanish, the theory
does behave as a conformal theory. From the gauge theory viewpoint this may be understood from the
relative magnitude of the trace of the stress tensor compared to the energy density or the pressure: while
at large T the latter quantities scale as T 4, the trace only grows as T 2. In Fig. 4 we show the temperature
dependence of the ratio of the stress tensor to the enthalpy,

 − 3p
 + p

I =

(3.18)

which in the thermal-QCD literature is sometimes referred to as the interaction measure. As anticipated,
both at low and high temperatures this ratio vanishes, indicating that the theory becomes eﬀectively
conformal in these limits. At intermediate temperatures, the value of I is non-zero and depends on φM .
As inferred from the behaviour of the entropy, the larger φM the larger the deviations from conformality in
the thermodynamic properties of the theory. Because of this behaviour we may use I as a measure of the
non-conformality of the theory.

Another way to quantify the non-conformal behaviour of the thermodynamics of the dual theory is
the value of the speed of sound. Using thermodynamic identities, the square of the speed of sound may be
determined from the inverse of the logarithmic derivative of the entropy,

(3.19)
√
In Fig. 5 we show the temperature behaviour of the deviation of cs from its conformal value, cs = 1/
3, for
diﬀerent values of φM . The qualitative behaviour of this quantity is very similar to that of I. Both at high
and low temperatures, the speed of sound approaches its conformal value. At intermediate temperatures
we have c2

s < 1/3 and the deviation from the conformal value grows with φM .

The non-conformal behaviour already observed in the equation of state of the system is also reﬂected
in the transport properties of the dual gauge theory plasma. Since this is isotropic, at leading order in
gradients transport phenomena are controlled by only two coeﬃcients, the shear viscosity η and the bulk
viscosity ζ. Because of the universality of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio [41] in all theories with a
two-derivative gravity dual, we have that this ratio in our model takes the same value as in the conformal
N = 4 theory, i.e. η/s = 1/4π. In contrast, the bulk viscosity, which would vanish identically in a CFT, is
non-zero in our model. Following3 [42] we determine the bulk viscosity by studying the dependence of the

The temperature dependence of this ratio is shown in Fig. 6 for diﬀerent values of φM . The behaviour
of this ratio is very similar to that of the interaction measure and the speed of sound: both at low and
high temperatures the ratio of the two viscosities vanishes, while at intermediate temperatures T ∼ Λ it
attains φM -dependent values that grow with φM . As in the case of  − 3p and the interaction measure,
the fact that the ratio of viscosities vanishes at high temperatures does not imply that the bulk viscosity
itself vanishes. In fact, we have checked numerically that at high temperatures the bulk viscosity scales
as ζ ∼ Λ2T . Nevertheless, the fact that the ratio of viscosities approaches zero shows that transport
is eﬀectively conformal, since the contribution to the hydrodynamic stress tensor of the bulk tensor is
suppressed with respect to the shear one.5

4 Quasi-normal modes and relaxation

We now turn to the description of the oﬀ-equilibrium dynamics of our holographic model. We study the
reaction of the system to small perturbations which drive it away from local equilibrium. On the gravity
side this problem translates into the study of the relaxation of the black brane solutions constructed above
when the diﬀerent background ﬁelds are perturbed. As is well known, this relaxation process is controlled
by an inﬁnite set of discrete, damped modes known as QNMs. In this section we will determine the QNM
frequencies of the system as a function of the temperature.

Since in our holographic model the scalar ﬁeld backreacts on the geometry, metric ﬂuctuations couple
to ﬂuctuations of the scalar ﬁeld and they must all be considered simultaneously. Denoting by G(T) the
black brane metric in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates (3.1), we will study ﬂuctuations of the form

G(T)

M N → G(T)

M N + hM N ,

φ → φ + ϕ .

(4.1)

4We have cross-checked the result of this computation with a two-point function computation as in [43].

See also [44] for a general analysis of the bulk viscosity for Dp-brane solutions.

5Here we are implicitly assuming that the magnitude of the shear tensor is not parametrically suppressed
with respect to the bulk one. Should the ﬂow of the system be prepared such that the shear tensor identically
vanishes, then transport would be dominated by the bulk tensor.

ϕM=1ϕM=3ϕM=10ϕM=10001234560.00.10.20.30.40.5πT/Λζ/ηThe dynamics of hM N and ϕ is governed by the linearised Einstein and scalar ﬁeld equations on the
background spacetime G(T)
M N . We will use the value of the unperturbed scalar ﬁeld φ as a coordinate in
the holographic direction.

As is well known (see e.g. [45]) not all ﬂuctuations are physical, since reparametrisation invariance

with χM a spacetime-dependent vector ﬁeld and ∇M the covariant derivative in the background metric
M N . Because of this symmetry, not all ﬂuctuations are physical and the relaxation dynamics of the
G(T)
black brane is encoded in the spectrum of gauge invariant combinations of ﬁelds.6

ϕ → ϕ + χM∇M φ ,

In this paper we will study the relaxation of homogeneous disturbances of the plasma. In other words,
we will allow for time but not for space dependence of the perturbations. We will consider both isotropic
and anisotropic perturbations and we will denote by z the direction of anisotropy. On the gravity side, these
perturbations will depend on time and on the holographic radial coordinate. Under these conditions, there
are only two independent sets of gauge invariant excitations of the plasma, which may be parametrized by
the following combination of ﬁelds7

Zaniso = e
Zbulk = ϕ − e−2A(φ)
2A(cid:48)(φ)

haa ,

(4.3)

(4.4)

where haa = (hxx + hyy)/2. The ﬁrst ﬂuctuation, Zaniso, controls anisotropic perturbations that leave unaf-
fected the expectation value of the scalar operator, the average pressure and the trace of the stress tensor.
The non-conformal mode Zbulk controls ﬂuctuations that change the three pressures in an isotropic way
and at the same time modify the expectation value of the scalar operator and the trace of the stress tensor.
At non-zero spatial momentum these excitations would be coupled to one another and they would include
the hydrodynamic modes. Our restriction to the space-independent sector implies that the energy density
of the plasma is unchanged by the ﬂuctuations (4.3)-(4.4), since in a homogeneous plasma conservation of
the stress tensor reduces to ∂t = 0.

Manipulating the linearised Einstein and Klein-Gordon equations and after a Fourier transform in

time, the dynamics of the Zaniso and Zbulk modes are given by the equations

equation for the bulk ﬂuctuations Zbulk includes an explicit dependence on the potential. The discrete set
of normalizable, in-falling solutions of this system of equations are the quasi-normal modes (QNMs). The

fact that the equations are linear in the frequency is a consequence of the Eddington-Finkelstein form of the
thermal metric eq. (3.1). Following [31] we use this to determine the QNMs and their associated frequencies
by spectral methods, which allow us to reduce the problem of ﬁnding the complex-valued spectrum of
excitations to an eigenvalue problem. This method is particularly suited for background metrics which are
only known numerically. We have also double-checked the results for some representative frequencies with
a shooting method.

The QNM frequencies depend on the temperature of the plasma. As the temperature changes, each of
these complex frequencies follows some trajectory in the complex plane. In Fig. 7 we show these trajectories
for the four lowest QNMs of the anisotropic perturbations Zaniso for diﬀerent values of φM . Each of the
points on a given trajectory corresponds to a diﬀerent value of the temperature. Note that in all panels these
trajectories begin and end at the same value, indicated by the crosses, "+". The reason for this is that the
Zaniso ﬂuctuations correspond in the gauge theory to ﬂuctuations exclusively of the stress tensor (i.e. with
no contribution of the scalar operator). Since the stress tensor is conserved, its dimension is exactly 4
both at the UV and at the IR ﬁxed points regardless of the value of φM . In a CFT, this information of
an operator alone would determine the spectrum of the dual QNMs. Since our theory approaches a CFT
in the UV and in the IR, the QNMs associated to the pure-stress-tensor ﬂuctuations Zaniso approach the
same limiting conformal values at high and low temperatures. In contrast, at intermediate temperatures all
the QNM frequencies possess a smaller imaginary part than their conformal counterparts. The magnitude
of this deviation depends on the non-conformality of the theory. For φM = 1, when the non-conformal
parameter I, eq. (3.18), is small at all temperatures, the complex plane trajectories of all modes remain
close to the conformal value. As φM increases the excursion of all modes in the complex plane deviates
more from the conformal values. Note, however, that these paths seem to saturate at very high value of
the parameter φM . In particular, even though the change in the number of IR degrees of freedom diﬀers
by more than 3 orders of magnitude, the excursion in the complex plane of the simulations with φM = 10
and φM = 100 are very similar. This is in accordance with the small change in non-conformality observed
in Fig. 4.

In Fig. 8 we show the complex-plane trajectories of the four lowest QNMs of the bulk mode Zbulk as
a function of temperature for diﬀerent values of φM . In all panels, the blue "+" crosses show the QNMs of
a probe scalar ﬁeld in an AdS black brane background dual to a CFT scalar operator of dimension 3 [47].
Similarly, the red "(cid:3)" squares show the QNMs of a probe scalar ﬁeld in an AdS black brane background
dual to an operator of dimension ∆IR given by eq. (2.9). Since this dimension depends on φM , the position
of the red "(cid:3)" squares changes from panel to panel. Based on our discussion of the Zaniso QNMs above,
one may expect that in the case of Zbulk the trajectories begin at the blue crosses at high temperature and
end at the red crosses at low temperature. However, as we can see from Fig. 8, the trajectories in this case
possess a more interesting structure.

In the upper left panel of Fig. 8 we show the trajectories for the φM = 1 potential. For this value,
the eﬀective IR mass of the scalar is such that the ﬁrst two QNMs of the ultraviolet probe scalar are closer
to the real axis than the ﬁrst QNM of the infrared probe scalar. This ordering determines the trajectories
of the QNMs as a function of temperature. As shown in the plot, starting from the IR, the lowest QNM
ﬂows towards the closest UV mode in the complex plane, which in this case is the second UV mode. All IR
modes follow similar trajectories in such a way that (at least as far as our numerics can resolve) the n-th
IR mode ﬂows to the (n + 1)-th ultraviolet mode.8 As a consequence, there are no available IR modes to
which the lowest UV mode can ﬂow into. Therefore, this mode decouples at low temperature, ﬂowing deep
intro the complex imaginary plane.

For the other values of φM displayed in Fig. 8, the positions of the IR and the UV modes alternate
in the complex plane, but this does not mean that the ﬂow induced by the temperature is a direct map
between these two sets of modes. Even though for the remaining three panels the lowest QNM ﬂows
between the lowest modes of the IR and UV theories, in all panels there is always a mode that decouples
from the spectrum, although that mode is diﬀerent for each of the displayed values of φM . The origin of this
decoupling is that, after a certain mode, the n-th IR mode ﬂows to the (n + 1)-th UV mode, interrupting
the trajectory of the n-th UV mode. When this happens, we observe a phenomenon similar to level anti-
crossing in quantum mechanics. We have checked that for φM = 1000 (not shown) the complex-plane

8We have tested this behaviour for the ﬁrst 8 QNMs.

trajectories are almost identical to the φM = 100 trajectories displayed in the bottom-right panel of Fig. 8.
This suggests that the observed structure saturates at large φM and is captured by the φM = 100 plot.

In Fig. 9 we show the temperature dependence of the imaginary (left) and real (right) parts of the ﬁrst
four quasi-normal frequencies for diﬀerent values of φM . Each plot shows the QNM of the anisotropic (blue)
and bulk (red) channels. As already discussed, both of these two sets of modes ﬂow from their values in the
UV ﬁxed point to their values in the IR ﬁxed point. As shown in the plots, the eﬀective conformal behaviour
of the QNMs at high temperature stops when the temperature becomes of order the source Λ. At higher
temperatures, the temperature dependence of both the real and imaginary part of the modes is non-trivial,
and it reﬂects the intricate trajectories in the complex plane displayed in Fig. 8 and Fig. 7. These plots
also show explicitly how the disappearance of one bulk QNM occurs at low temperature. The fact that this
disappearance seems to be linear in all plots in Fig. 9 clariﬁes the temperature dependence of this mode.
The observed constant slope implies that this quasi-normal frequency becomes temperature-independent at
low temperature (we have explicitly checked this) and therefore it decouples from the IR theory.

As a ﬁnal remark, we note that the numerical results displayed in Fig. 9 allow us to compare the
magnitude of the diﬀerent modes at the same temperature. As we will discuss in more detail in the next
section, the imaginary part of the quasi-normal frequencies is related to the relaxation back to equilibrium
of small plasma perturbations.
It is interesting to note that the ordering of the imaginary parts of the
anisotropic and bulk modes changes with temperature: while at high temperatures the imaginary part of
the lowest bulk mode is smaller than that of the anisotropic mode, at low temperatures this order is reversed.
This crossing of the imaginary parts of the lowest modes is present for all values of φM . Nevertheless, at
φM = 1 this eﬀect is much more prominent, since for this φM the disappearing QNM is the lowest bulk
mode at high temperature. In the next section we will discuss the consequences of this behaviour.

5 Discussion

The behaviour of the QNM with smallest imaginary part, dubbed the lowest QNM, is particularly rele-
vant for understanding the oﬀ-equilibrium dynamics of theories with a gravity dual. At non-zero spatial
momentum, the lowest QNM of metric perturbations is dual to hydrodynamic excitations of the dual the-
ory. However, in the zero-spatial momentum limit we have considered, the residues of the hydrodynamic
poles vanish.9 In this limit the relaxation back to equilibrium is controlled by the QNM frequencies, with
the longest-lived excitation corresponding to the lowest QNM. We will refer to the inverses of the imag-
inary parts of the frequencies of the lowest QNMs in the diﬀerent channels as relaxation times.
In the
non-conformal theory that we have studied, these important time scales have a very interesting behaviour.
As shown in Fig. 9, the relaxation time associated to the anisotropic and bulk channels have a non-
trivial temperature dependence, as a consequence of non-conformality. To best understand the origin of
this temperature dependence, following [31, 32] in Fig. 10 we show the imaginary part of the lowest QNM
as a function of δ = 1/3 − c2
s for the anisotropic channel (left) and the bulk channel (right) for diﬀerent
values of φM . For the anisotropic channel, most of this dependence may be understood as a consequence of
the change of the speed of sound, similarly to the holographic constructions analysed in [31, 32]. Although
the inverse relaxation time is not just a common function of cs for all models, up to small corrections a
simple linear dependence of the imaginary part of the lowest anisotropic mode on δ = 1/3 − c2
s provides a
good estimate for the relaxation time in this channel. This simple approximate scaling does not work in
the bulk channel, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 10. Unlike the anisotropic channel, the relaxation time
is inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly by the change in the scaling dimension of the scalar operator in the high and low

9We thank A. Starinets for clarifying this point to us.

Therefore, the
relaxation of strongly coupled gauge theories is, in general, not just controlled by thermodynamic properties,
but additional microscopic dynamics of the theory may also be important to understand this complicated
process.

The diﬀerent behaviour of these time scales reﬂects the fact that the way in which the system relaxes
depends on the way it is excited. To focus the discussion, we will restrict ourselves to generic excitations
of the stress tensor of the system. Since in a CFT the trace of the stress tensor vanishes by symmetry, in
a CFT this trace cannot be aﬀected by ﬂuctuations of the bulk mode. Since in addition the bulk mode is
isotropic, it follows that the stress tensor itself in a CFT cannot be aﬀected by the bulk mode. Because
of this decoupling, the relaxation of small excitations of the stress tensor is controlled solely by the lowest
mode of the anisotropic channel, given by the δ = 0 intercept of Fig. 10 (left). In a non-conformal theory,
however, this decoupling does not occur. Because of non-conformality, the ﬂuctuations of the stress tensor
and of the operator O mix. As an example, note that small isotropic variations of the pressure of the
system, which at ﬁnite momentum are part of the sound channel, excite the bulk mode, as it can be easily
inferred from the Ward identity eq. (3.17). More generally, the variation of the stress tensor associated to
the two ﬂuctuating channels (4.3)-(4.4) is given by

bulk and Z (4)

where ∆pz and ∆p⊥ are the diagonal components of the stress tensor along the direction of the anisotropic
perturbation and perpendicular to it, and Z (3)
aniso are the normalisable modes of the perturbations.
These expressions show explicitly how both channels aﬀect the dynamics of the pressure, while only the
bulk channel aﬀects the expectation value of the scalar operator. As a consequence, the relaxation of the
stress tensor of the system will be dominated by the mode with the smallest imaginary part of the two sets
of towers displayed in Fig. 9. As it can be seen in this plot, for all values of φM , relaxation is dominated
by diﬀerent modes at high and low temperatures. The competition between these two channels implies
that the relaxation dynamics in our family of holographic models follows diﬀerent paths at high and low
temperatures.

The contributions of the anisotropic and the bulk modes to the stress tensor codify two diﬀerent
physical processes. As explained above, the anisotropic mode controls anisotropic perturbations of the
pressure that leave unaﬀected the energy density, the expectation value of the scalar operator, the average
pressure and the trace of the stress tensor. The bulk mode controls ﬂuctuations that change the three
pressures in an isotropic way and at the same time modify the expectation value of the scalar operator
and the relation between the energy density and pressure given by the equation of state. The relaxation of
a generic small stress tensor disturbance therefore requires two distinct process: the isotropisation of the
system, which amounts to equating the diagonal spatial components of the stress tensor (pressures); and
the equilibration of the system, with which we only refer to the process by which the trace of the stress
tensor attains its equilibrium value.

Consider ﬁrst the case in which the anisotropic mode dominates the relaxation process, meaning
that its associated lowest QNM decays faster than that associated to the bulk mode.
In this case the
system ﬁrst relaxes the trace of the stress tensor, such that the pressures of the system no longer ﬂuctuate
independently, and only later equates the value of all the pressures to one another. In other words, the
system ﬁrst equilibrates and subsequently isotropises. This is the behaviour of the holographic models at
small values of φM , such as φM = 1, 3, at low temperatures. Since in CFTs the trace of the stress tensor is
ﬁxed, this relaxation path is very similar to that in CFTs.

In contrast, consider now the opposite case in which relaxation is dominated by the bulk mode, meaning
that its associated lowest QNM decays faster than that associated to the anisotropic mode. In this case
the pressure of the system is ﬁrst isotropised to a value that is not related to the energy density through
the equation of state, and only later the subsequent dynamics of this isotropic stress tensor relaxes this

– 15 –

value of the pressure to that dictated by the equation of state. At high temperatures, this is the path to
equilibration followed by our models, which diﬀers qualitatively from the conformal case.

Finally, when the two relaxation times are comparable, as it is the case in the low temperature regime

for large values of φM = 10, 100, both of these processes occur simultaneously.

Although the analysis of QNMs can only provide deﬁnite answers for the fate of small perturbations oﬀ-
equilibrium, the rich structure exhibited in this relaxation process has implications for the dynamics of initial
conﬁgurations that are far oﬀ-equilibrium. As we mentioned above, the numerical analyses of collisions in
N = 4 SYM yield hydrodynamisation times that are comparable to the relaxation times obtained via a
QNM analysis. While the microscopic explanation of this observation is not understood, this experience
has led the authors of [30] to suggest that the hydrodynamisation of non-conformal theories is basically
controlled by the temperature of hydrodynamisation, with small (non-parametric) diﬀerences with respect
to the conformal case. Following this reasoning, we may estimate how much longer the hydrodynamisation
can be in the family of theories that we have studied. Given the mixing of the bulk and anisotropic modes,
this longest relaxation is given by the absolute minimum of the (negative) imaginary part of the QNM
sets which, as shown in Fig. 9, is always controlled by the bulk mode. Comparing with the relaxation
of conformal theories τconf = 0.73/2πT , this maximal relaxation is τmax/τconf = 2.1, 2.5, 3.0, 3.15 for
φM = 1, 3, 10, 100. These maxima occur at T /Λ = 0.33, 0.19, 0.16, 0.16 for each model respectively. It
would be interesting to test explicitly whether the connection with the linearised analysis persists in full
numerical simulations of shock collisions in our non-conformal backgrounds. In particular, this would allow
the study of the impact of the diﬀerent relaxation channels on the on-set of hydrodynamic behaviour.
