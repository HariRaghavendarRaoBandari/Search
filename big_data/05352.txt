AN ELEMENTAL ERD ˝OS–KAC THEOREM FOR

ALGEBRAIC NUMBER FIELDS

PAUL POLLACK

Abstract. Fix a number ﬁeld K. For each nonzero α ∈ ZK , let ν(α) denote the num-
ber of distinct, nonassociate irreducible divisors of α. We show that ν(α) is normally dis-
tributed with mean proportional to (log log |N (α)|)D and standard deviation proportional
to (log log |N (α)|)D−1/2. Here D, as well as the constants of proportionality, depend only
on the class group of K. For example, for each ﬁxed real λ, the proportion of α ∈ Z[√−5]
with

ν(α) ≤
e−t2/2 dt. As further evidence that “irreducibles play a game of chance”,

is given by 1
we show that the values ν(α) are equidistributed modulo m for every ﬁxed m.

1. Introduction

The ﬁeld of probabilistic number theory was born in 1939 out of a fruitful collaboration of
Erd˝os and Kac. Let ω(n) denote the number of distinct prime factors of the positive integer
n. The celebrated Erd˝os–Kac theorem asserts that the quantity

ω(n) − log log x

√log log x

,

thought of as a random variable on the natural numbers n ≤ x (with the uniform measure),
converges in law to a standard Gaussian, as x → ∞ [EK40]. In this statement, log log x may
be changed to log log n without aﬀecting the meaning, since the two quantities diﬀer by less
than 1 for all n ∈ (x1/e, x]. Thus, the theorem is often summarized by saying that ω(n) is
normally distributed with mean log log n and standard deviation √log log n.
Variants of the Erd˝os–Kac theorem abound (see [Kro66], [Ell80], [Liu04], [KL08], and the
references in [GS07]). In this article, we describe what appears to be a new generalization
in the number ﬁeld setting.

Suppose that K is a number ﬁeld with ring of integers ZK. Let Id(ZK) denote the
(commutative, cancellative) monoid of nonzero integral ideals of ZK, and let Prin(ZK) denote
the submonoid of principal ideals. For each a ∈ Id(ZK), let ω(a) denote the number of
distinct prime ideal factors of a. In [Liu04], Liu proves an Id(ZK)-generalization of Erd˝os–
Kac, namely that ω(a) is normally distributed with mean log log N(a) and standard deviation

plog log N(a).

The “fundamental theorem of ideal theory” asserts that Id(ZK) is a factorial monoid, with
the prime elements in the monoid sense coinciding with the nonzero prime ideals of ZK. By
contrast, Prin(ZK) is in general not factorial, as shown by the famous example

(1 + √−5)(1 − √−5) = (2)(3)

when K = Q(√−5). Notwithstanding the failure of unique factorization, it is still sensible to

count the number of irreducible divisors of an element of Prin(ZK) and to ask if something
like the Erd˝os–Kac theorem holds. Our main theorem asserts that this is indeed the case.
For each nonzero α ∈ ZK, we let ν(α) denote the number of nonassociate irreducible
divisors of α. (Equivalently, ν(α) is the number of irreducible divisors of (α) in the monoid
Prin(ZK).) We let logk denote the k-fold iterated logarithm.

Theorem 1. Let K be a number ﬁeld. There are positive constants A and B, as well as a
positive integer D, such that the following holds. For each ﬁxed λ > 0,
#{(α) : 0 < |N(α)| ≤ x and ν(α) ≤ A(log2 x)D + λ · B(log2 x)D− 1
2}

e−t2/2 dt,

#{(α) : 0 < |N(α)| ≤ x}

→Z λ

−∞

as x → ∞. Moreover, the constants A, B, and D depend only on the isomorphism type of
the class group of K.

We can summarize Theorem 1 as asserting that ν(α) has a normal distribution with mean
A(log2 |N(α)|)D and standard deviation B(log2 |N(α)|)D− 1
2 .
We say a little about the values of A, B, and D. Of the three, D is the simplest to describe:
It is the smallest integer with the property that any sequence of D elements of the class group
Cl(ZK) contains a nonempty subsequence which multiplies to the identity. (If G is any ﬁnite
abelian group, the analogous quantity has become known as the Davenport constant of G,
and there is now a large literature on determining values of Davenport constants.) The
appearance of D in Theorem 1 is not so surprising. In fact, the constant D is important
to us for precisely the same reason it ﬁrst caught the attention of Davenport: D is the
maximal number of prime ideals (counting multiplicity) that appear in the decomposition
of an irreducible element of ZK.1 The constants A and B are more complicated to deﬁne,
but in the case when Cl(ZK) is cyclic of order h, we will show that A = φ(h)h−hh!−1 and
B = h−h+3/2h!−1φ(h)1/2.

A few words about strategy are in order. The function ν(α) is not additive in any
reasonable sense; even if α and β generate comaximal ideals of ZK, we need not have

ν(αβ) = ν(α) + ν(β). For example, in Z[√−5], we have ν(2) = 1 and ν(3) = 1, whereas

ν(6) = 4. To work around this, we cook up an additive function f on Id(ZK) such that the
behavior of ν is — most of the time, and on the scale important for us — determined by the
distribution of f restricted to Prin(ZK). We then study the distribution of f|Prin(ZK ) using
the method of Granville–Soundararajan for proving Erd˝os–Kac type theorems [GS07].
Of course, many other problems concerning ν could be investigated. We content our-
selves with proving one additional result further reinforcing that “irreducibles play a game
of chance.”
Theorem 2. Fix m ∈ Z+. Then ν(α) is equidistributed modulo m as α ranges over ZK.
More precisely, for each a ∈ Z,

lim
x→∞

#{(α) : 0 < |N(α)| ≤ x, ν(α) ≡ a (mod m)}

=

#{(α) : 0 < |N(α)| ≤ x}

.

When K = Q, this result is well-known (compare with [Sel39], [Pil40], [Add57]). In fact,
when K = Q and m = 2, it goes back to von Mangoldt [Man97]; that case was later
proved to be “elementarily equivalent” to the prime number theorem in work of Landau
[Lan99, Lan11]. (Actually, von Mangoldt and Landau deal with squarefree positive integers,
but a convolution argument shows that the equidistribution assertion for squarefree integers

1According to Olson [Ols69], Davenport reported this observation at the Midwestern conference on group

theory and number theory, Ohio State University, April 1966.

AN ELEMENTAL ERD ˝OS-KAC THEOREM

3

is “elementarily equivalent” to the assertion for all positive integers.) Our proof of Theorem
2 is easily adapted to prove the equidistribution mod m of the count of prime ideal divisors
of elements of Id(ZK) (this is again classical when m = 2 [Lan03]), or of Prin(ZK); in fact,
the arguments in these cases are much simpler.

Several further quantitative problems concerning factorizations in Prin(ZK) have been
considered by Geroldinger, Halter-Koch, Kaczorowski, Narkiewicz, Odoni, R´emond, ´Sliwa,
and others. The interested reader is referred to the discussion in Chapter 9 of [Nar04] as
well as the extensive end-of-chapter references there. See also [GHK06, Chapter 9].

2. Algebro-analytic input

For the rest of this paper, K is a degree d number ﬁeld admitting r1 real embeddings
and r2 pairs of complex conjugate embeddings, so that d = r1 + 2r2. We let h := #Cl(ZK)
denote the class number, R the regulator, ∆ the discriminant, and w the number of roots of
unity contained in K. We ﬁx an ordering C1, . . . , Ch of the elements of Cl(ZK). Elements of
Id(ZK) are generally indicated with Fraktur letters; p and q are reserved for nonzero prime
ideals of ZK. Implied constants may always depend on K without further mention.

The next two results are classical.

3. Reduction to a standard Erd˝os-Kac problem

3.1. Preliminary anatomical results. We begin by recording two easy consequences of
the analytic lemmas recalled in the preceding section. For each i = 1, 2, . . . , h, let ωi(a)
denote the number of distinct prime ideal factors of a from Ci, and let Ωi(a) denote the
corresponding count with multiplicity. Then ωi and Ωi are additive functions on Id(ZK), in
the sense that ωi(ab) = ωi(a) + ωi(b) for comaximal ideals a and b, and similarly for Ωi.
Proposition 5. For each i = 1, 2, . . . , h, and all x ≥ 3, we have
= O(x log2 x).

Proposition 6. For each i = 1, 2, . . . , h, and all x ≥ 3, we have

(Ωi(a) − ωi(a)) = O(x).

Propositions 5 and 6 follow by a straightforward imitation of the classical proofs for K = Q
(22.10.1), (22.10.2), and

(when h = 1), as found in Hardy and Wright [HW08, see eqs.
(22.11.7)].

3.2. The type of an irreducible and a decomposition of ν(α). Let π be an irreducible
element of ZK. Suppose that the decomposition of (π) into prime ideals takes the form

(1)

(π) = p1 · · · pg.

The irreducibility of π guarantees that no nonempty, proper subsequence of p1, . . . , pg multi-
plies to a principal ideal. Hence, g ≤ D, the Davenport constant of the class group Cl(ZK).
On the other hand, if p1, . . . , pg are prime ideals whose product is principal but no nonempty
proper subproduct is principal, then p1 · · · pg = (π) for an irreducible π. Since every ideal
class contains prime ideals, one can construct irreducibles π with D prime ideal factors
(counting multiplicity): choose p1, . . . , pD−1 having no nontrivial principal subproduct, and
choose pD so that p1 · · · pD is principal. Then each generator π of p1 · · · pD is irreducible. We
thus recover Davenport’s result that D is the maximal number of prime ideals appearing in
the decomposition of an irreducible element of ZK.

Deﬁne the type τ of π as the integer tuple (t1, . . . , th), where ti is the number of p in (1)
belonging to Ci, counted with multiplicity. Let T denote the set of types τ that correspond
to some irreducible. For each τ = (t1, . . . , th) ∈ T, we have t1 + · · · + th = g ≤ D. When
t1 + · · · + th = D, we say τ is of maximal length.
For α ∈ ZK and τ ∈ T, we deﬁne ντ (α) as the number of distinct nonassociate irreducibles
dividing α and having type τ . Thus,

We now turn attention to the summands ντ (α).

ν(α) =Xτ ∈T

ντ (α).

Specifying a type-τ irreducible factor of α amounts to making h choices: For each 1 ≤
i ≤ h, we must choose ti prime ideals (not necessarily distinct) from the multiset of prime
ideals dividing αi belonging to the class Ci. Abusing notation somewhat and writing ωi(α)
for ωi((α)), and similarly for Ωi, the number of ways the ith choice can be made is bounded

below by (cid:0)ωi(α)

ti (cid:1) and bounded above by (cid:0)Ωi(α)

ti (cid:1). Hence,

h

h

(2)

Yi=1(cid:18)ωi(α)

ti (cid:19) ≤ ντ (α) ≤

ti (cid:19).
Yi=1(cid:18)Ωi(α)

In order to obtain useful estimates from (2), we will assume that α avoids a small excep-
tional set. Let x ≥ 3, and let α be a nonzero element of ZK with |N(α)| ≤ x. It is convenient
for what follows if (α) satisﬁes

(i) |ωi(α) − 1
(ii) |Ωi(α) − ωi(α)| < log3 x for all i = 1, 2, . . . , h.

h log2 x| < (log2 x)2/3 for all i = 1, 2, . . . , h,

Let E denote the set of principal ideals (α) of norm not exceeding x for which one at least
of (i) or (ii) fails. Propositions 5 and 6 imply that

# E ≪ x/ log3 x.

In particular, E makes up asymptotically 0% of the the principal ideals of norm bounded by
x, as x → ∞.

Suppose that (α) /∈ E. Using (i), we see that

On the other hand, (i) and (ii) together imply that Ωi(α)/ωi(α) = 1 + O(log3 x/ log2 x) for
each i = 1, 2, . . . , h. Hence,

If τ is not of maximal length, so that t1 +· · · + th ≤ D − 1, we deduce from the upper bound
in (2) along with (i) and (4) that

Suppose now that τ is of maximal length. Then combining (2), (3), and (4) with (i) reveals
that

ντ (α) = O((log2 x)D−1).

Example (Calculation of A and B when the class group is cyclic; cf. [B ¨ORS05, §4]). Suppose
that Cl(ZK) is a cyclic group of order h. Then D = h. (See [Nar04, §9.1] for basic facts
about Davenport constants.) We suppose the ideal classes are numbered so that, under a
ﬁxed isomorphism of Cl(ZK) with Z/hZ, the class Ci corresponds to i mod h. Then there are
φ(h) types τ of maximum length, namely (0, , . . . , 0, h, 0, . . . , 0), where the allowed positions
for ‘h’ are precisely the units mod h (compare with [GR09, Corollary 2.1.4, p. 24]). From
(7), we see that κj = 1
(h−1)! when gcd(j, h) = 1 and κj = 0 otherwise. After a bit of algebra,

To prove Theorem 7, we follow very closely the approach to the Erd˝os–Kac theorem
detailed by Granville and Soundararajan [GS07]. By the method of moments (the Fr´echet-
Shohat theorem), to prove Theorem 7 it is suﬃcient to establish the following estimates.

Sum both sides over principal ideals (α) with 0 < |N(α)| ≤ x. To estimate the main term
on the right-hand side, we may appeal to Lemma 9. We can also use Lemma 9 to see that

The error term here is harmless: For any ǫ > 0, there are ≪ǫ N(R)ǫ ≤ zkǫ = xǫ/2d ideal
divisors of R. Hence, the number of pairs d, e with de dividing R is crudely ≪ǫ xǫ/d. Trivially,
1/N(de)1−1/d ≤ 1, and so we see (taking ǫ = 1/4) that the O-term above is O(x1− 3

AN ELEMENTAL ERD ˝OS-KAC THEOREM

11

Remark. Theorem 7 could also be proved by applying the results of [Kro66, Chapter 2], with
Lemma 4 used as the analytic input. De Kroon proves an Erd˝os–Kac theorem for f|Prin(ZK ),
for additive functions f on Id(ZK) satisfying conditions analogous to those in the main
theorem of [EK40]. De Kroon’s approach follows [EK40], in that the central limit theorem
is used in combination with Brun’s sieve. We have preferred to give a more self-contained
proof illustrating the ﬂexibility of the method of [GS07].

5. Remarks on Theorem 1

5.1. A Prin(ZK)-analogue of an observation of Kac. Let d(n) denote the classical di-
visor function. In 1941, Kac [Kac41] showed that log d(n)
is normally distributed with mean
log 2
and variance log2 n. This can be proved by the following simple argument: According to
[EK40], both ω(n) and Ω(n) are normally distributed with mean and variance log2 n; now
observe that 2ω(n) ≤ d(n) ≤ 2Ω(n) for all n.
Substituting the results of [Liu04] for those of [EK40], an identical argument shows that
the divisor function on Id(ZK) — which by abuse of notation we will also denote d — is
normally distributed with mean and variance log2 N(a). Seeking a Prin(ZK) analogue, deﬁne
δ(α) for nonzero α ∈ ZK as the number of nonassociate divisors of α. It turns out that δ is
distributed in the same way as d, by which we mean that log δ(α)
is normal with mean and
log 2
variance log2 |N(α)|.
Let us sketch the proof. First, one shows that ω(α) :=Ph
i=1 Ωi(α)
are both normally distributed with mean and variance log2 |N(α)|. For ω, this follows from
Theorem 7 with κ1 = · · · = κh = 1. The Ω assertion then follows from Proposition 6. (For
these claims, one could also appeal to [Kro66].) Next, one observes that δ(α) ≤ d(α) ≤ 2Ω(α).
On the other hand, one can construct many nonassociate divisors of α by the following recipe:
For each i = 1, 2, . . . , h, list the distinct prime ideal divisors of α belonging to Ci, choose a
subset of these whose cardinality is a multiple of h, and then multiply the prime ideals from
each of these subsets. This construction yields

i=1 ωi(α) and Ω(α) :=Ph

δ(α) ≥

h

Yi=1  X0≤j≤ωi(α)

h|j

j (cid:19)!.
(cid:18)ωi(α)

For each i, the sum on j is ≫ 2ωi(α). (One can see this by rewriting the sum as 1
where ζ runs over the hth roots of unity, and noting that ζ = 1 dominates.) It follows that

hPζ(1+ζ)ωi(α),

δ(α) ≫ 2ω1(α)+···+ωh(α) = 2ω(α).

Thus,

and now we can obtain the normal distribution result for δ in the same way as for d.

2ω(α)+O(1) ≤ δ(α) ≤ 2Ω(α),

5.2. Average order results. One can show that as x → ∞, the average of ν(α) on principal
ideals (α) of norm ≤ x is ∼ A(log log x)D (for the same constant A from Theorem 1), while
the corresponding average of δ(α) is ∼ Ψ
h log x. These estimates are considerably simpler
to prove than the normal order results discussed above. Indeed, they follow more or less
immediately from

X(π): |N (π)|≤x

π irreducible

|N(π)| ∼ A(log log x)D and

X(α): 0<|N (α)|≤x

PAUL POLLACK

The second of these may be derived quickly by partial summation from Lemma 3. The
ﬁrst can be proved by methods discussed earlier in this article, or by partial summation in
conjunction with R´emond’s asymptotic formula for the count of nonassociate irreducibles of
bounded norm [R´em66, Th´eor`eme II, pp. 391–392, and Corollaire, pp. 409–410].

6. Equidistribution of ν(α) in residue classes:

Proof of Theorem 2

Below, we say a multiplicative function f on Id(ZK) is of ﬁnite order if for some positive

integer r, all of the nonzero values of f are rth roots of unity.

Lemma 10. Let f be a multiplicative function on Id(ZK) of ﬁnite order. Suppose that

(11)

1
N p

Xf (p)6=1

diverges.

Then f has mean value 0 on Id(ZK), in the sense that

f (a) = o(x),

XN a≤x

as x → ∞.
Proof. This appears to be well-known when K = Q, and the argument in the general case
is the same; for lack of a suitable reference we sketch the proof. We use a theorem of
Hal´asz [Hal68], as generalized to “arithmetic semigroups” (a setting which includes Id(ZK))
by Lucht and Reifenrath [LR01, Theorem 6.1]. It suﬃces to show that for each real number
t, the series

(12)

1 − ℜ(f (p) · N(p)−it)

N p

Xp

diverges. The divergence when t = 0 follows quickly from (11). Now suppose that t 6= 0.
Fix a positive integer r such that f (Id(ZK)) is contained in {0} ∪ {ζ : ζ r = 1}. The prime
ideal theorem implies that for ≫r x/ log x prime ideals of norm not exceeding x, the quantity
N(p)it lies at a distance ≫r 1 from each rth root of unity; the divergence of (12) is an easy
consequence.

(cid:3)

Lemma 11. Let f be a multiplicative function on Id(ZK) of ﬁnite order. Suppose that

1
N p

Xp principal

f (p)6=1

diverges.

Then f has mean value 0 along each ideal class, in the sense that for each i = 1, 2, . . . , h,

f (a) = o(x),

XN a≤x

a∈ Ci

as x → ∞.
Proof. By the orthogonality relations for group characters, it suﬃces to show that for each
character χ of the class group Cl(ZK), the function χf has mean value 0 on Id(ZK). This
follows immediately from Lemma 10.
(cid:3)

AN ELEMENTAL ERD ˝OS-KAC THEOREM

13

Proof of Theorem 2. Throughout this proof, we assume that the ideal classes Ci are num-
bered so that C1 is the principal class. By the orthogonality relations for additive characters
mod m, it suﬃces to show that for all nontrivial mth roots of unity ζ,

(13)

X(α)

0<|N (α)|≤x

ζ ν(α) = o(x),

as x → ∞.

Fix a nonzero, squarefull ideal s of ZK. We study the contribution to (13) from (α) with
squarefull part s in Id(ZK). Write (α) = su, so that u is a squarefree ideal, s and u are
comaximal, and [u] = [s]−1. Then

(14)

and

ν(α) =Xτ ∈T

ντ (α) = ω1(α) + Xτ ∈T

t1(τ )=0

ντ (α),

ω1(α) = ω1(s) + ω1(u).

(We used here that (1, 0, . . . , 0) is the only type in T with a nonvanishing t1 coeﬃcient, and
that ν(1,0,...,0)(α) = ω1(α).) For each τ ∈ T with t1(τ ) = 0, let

D (s, τ ) = {d ∈ Id(ZK) : d | s, Ωi(d) ≤ ti(τ ) for all i = 1, 2, . . . , h}.

Any irreducible of type τ dividing α can be written uniquely as the product of an element
of D (s, τ ) and a cofactor relatively prime to s. Thus,

(15)

ντ (α) = Xd∈ D (s,τ )

h

Yi=1(cid:18)Ωi(α) − Ωi(s)

ti(τ ) − Ωi(d)(cid:19) = Xd∈ D (s,τ )

h

Yi=2(cid:18)

ωi(u)

ti(τ ) − Ωi(d)(cid:19).

Keeping in mind the universal bound ti(τ ) ≤ h, it follows from (15) that the residue class
class mod m of

where ζ2, . . . , ζh are (mh!)th roots of unity. Referring back to (14), we see that ζ ν(α) is a
ﬁnite C-linear combination of expressions of the form
· · · ζ ωh(u)

ζ ω1(u)ζ ω2(u)

h

.

Thus,

ζ ν(α)

X(α)

squarefull part s

0<|N (α)|≤x

is a ﬁnite C-linear combination of sums of the form

XN u≤x/N (s)

[u]=[s]−1

1gcd(u,s)=1 · µ2(u) · ζ ω1(u)ζ ω2(u)

2

· · · ζ ωh(u)

h

.

depends only on the vector

Consequently, ﬁnite Fourier theory implies that

(ω2(u) mod mh!, . . . , ωh(u) mod mh!) ∈ (Z/mh!Z)h−1.

ζ Pτ ∈T, t1(τ )=0 ντ (α)

can be written as a ﬁnite C-linear combination of terms of the form

ντ (α)

Xτ ∈T

t1(τ )=0

ζ ω2(u)

PAUL POLLACK

For all choices of (mh)!th roots of unity ζ2, . . . , ζh, the function

u 7→ 1gcd(u,s)=1 · µ2(u) · ζ ω1(u)ζ ω2(u)

2

· · · ζ ωh(u)

h

satisﬁes the conditions of Lemma 11. Hence, the contribution to (13) from (α) with a ﬁxed
squarefull part is o(x), as x → ∞.
We now ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 2. Let ǫ > 0. Let B be a large, ﬁxed real number.
Continuing to use s for the squarefull part of (α), we see that the contribution to (13) from
(α) with N s ≤ B is o(x), as x → ∞. On the other hand,

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

The sum appearing here is the tail of a convergent series, since

So if we choose B suﬃciently large, those (α) with N s > B contribute less than ǫx. Since
ǫ > 0 is arbitrary, Theorem 2 follows.
(cid:3)

Remark. The distribution of δ(α) in residue classes is much more complicated than that of
ν(α), even in the case K = Q (for which see [Nar86, Chapter 5, §3]).
