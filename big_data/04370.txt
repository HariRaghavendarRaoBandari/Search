Abstract

The Josephson eﬀect provides a direct method to probe the strength of the pairing interaction

in superconductors. By measuring the phase ﬂuctuating Josephson current between a supercon-

ducting tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and a BCS superconductor with isolated

magnetic adatoms on its surface, we demonstrate that the spatial variation of the pairing order

parameter can be characterized on the atomic scale. This system provides an example where the

local pairing potential suppression is not directly reﬂected in the spectra measured via quasipartcile

tunneling. Spectroscopy with such superconducting tips also show signatures of previously unex-

plored Andreev processes through individual impurity-bound Shiba states. The atomic resolution

achieved here establishes scanning Josephson spectroscopy as a promising technique for the study

of novel superconducting phases.

A number of novel superconducting states of matter such as those appearing in disor-

dered superconductors, heavy fermion materials, and high-Tc superconductors have been

predicted to have pairing order parameters that are spatially modulated on atomic length

scales. These short range spatial modulations can occur due to diﬀerent mechanisms such

as the inhomogeneous material properties in disordered superconductors [1–4], a momentum

dependent pairing interaction, such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnkov (FFLO) state

proposed for heavy fermion materials [5–7], or the interplay between diﬀerent forms of elec-

tronic ordering in the pair density waves proposed for high-Tc cuprates [8–10]. Although

spectroscopic mapping with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) can provide evidence

for variations in the local density of states (LDOS) through quasi-particle tunneling, such

measurements probe the superconducting order parameter only indirectly. If the Josephson

eﬀect can be measured and mapped on the atomic scale, then it would allow for direct

characterization of the local pairing order parameter and high-resolution studies of novel

superconducting phases [11].

This goal has motivated previous eﬀorts in the use of superconducting tips in STM [12]

and has led to the local observation of thermal phase ﬂuctuating Josephson supercurrent

close to the point contact regime [13–15]. Subsequent measurements have mapped the

Josephson eﬀect on the nanometer scale, applying this technique to vortices [16, 17] and

high-Tc cuprates [18, 19]. A major challenge in improving the resolution of these experiments

has been satisfying the competing requirements of a high junction impedance necessary for

imaging and a low junction impedance allowing for the strong tip-sample coupling necessary

to observe the Josephson eﬀect despite thermal ﬂuctuations. Extending the Josephson STM

measurements to millikelvin temperatures allows for mapping of the Cooper pair current at

junction resistances that are compatible with atomic resolution imaging.

In this letter, we use scanning Josephson spectroscopy to probe variations of the super-

conducting order parameter on the scale of a single atom. We map the strength of the

phase ﬂuctuating Josephson current between a superconducting Pb tip and a Pb(110) sur-

face with a dilute concentration of magnetic impurities using a dilution refrigerator STM

system. By modeling the interaction of the electromagnetic environment with our Joseph-

son STM setup, we can understand the spectroscopic data taken with a superconducting

tip, including the signatures of photon-assisted inelastic Cooper pair tunneling at non-zero

bias. Our measurements show a 10-15% reduction of the Josephson critical current Ic over a

2

few Angstrom length scale in the vicinity of the magnetic adatoms, thereby demonstrating

a local suppression of the order parameter. We do not observe a commensurate shift in

the coherence peak energies in the single particle spectrum, which is consistent with the-

oretical calculations [20, 21], highlighting the ability of the Josephson STM technique to

probe physics inaccessible through traditional STM quasiparticle tunneling. Additionally,

spatially resolved spectroscopy with a superconducting tip allows us to detect novel Andreev

tunneling processes through impurity-bound Shiba states of the individual adatoms.

Our measurements have been carried out using a home-built dilution refrigerator STM

system, with a base temperature of 20 mK and a spectroscopic resolution that corresponds

to an eﬀective electron temperature of 250 mK [22]. For the present experiments, we used

a Pb(110) single crystal that was prepared in-situ with several cycles of Ar sputtering and

annealing to produce an atomically ordered ﬂat surface. Fig. 1(a) shows spectroscopic

measurements of the atomic Pb(110) surface [inset of Fig. 1(a)] measured using a normal

W tip at base temperature. The two coherence peaks in the spectrum are indicative of two

pairing gaps in bulk Pb associated with two diﬀerent Fermi surfaces. As shown in this ﬁgure,

the data can be modeled using a sum of two BCS densities of states with corresponding gaps,

∆1 = 1.26 meV and ∆2 = 1.42 meV, including an energy broadening associated with ﬁnite

temperature (250 mK) and a quasi-particle lifetime (8 µeV). Although the two gaps in

Pb have been previously detected in planar junctions [23, 24] and in STM studies using

superconducting tips [25], our ability to resolve them with a normal tip demonstrates the

high energy resolution aﬀorded by the low temperature operation of our system.

To create a Josephson junction in our STM setup, we prepare a superconducting Pb tip

by indenting a W tip into the Pb(110) substrate until the spectra measured with such a tip

exhibit features indicative of quasi-particle tunneling between two superconductors [12, 25].

As seen in Fig. 1(b), the tunneling spectra with such tips show sharp coherence peaks at

voltages corresponding to the sum of the tip and substrate superconducting gaps, with a tip

gap ∆tip ranging from 1.3-1.4 meV (approximately that of bulk Pb), depending on the tip.

We do not resolve additional structure in the coherence peaks arising from multiple gaps in

the tip, which suggests that the superconducting apex of the tip is amorphous in nature,

consistent with previous measurements [25]. For simplicity, we assume below that the gap
of the tip and sample are the same and deﬁne ∆Pb (cid:39) (∆1 + ∆2)/2 (cid:39) ∆tip ≈ 1.35 meV.

While spectroscopy at high junction resistances with the Pb tips show only signatures

features associated with Andreev reﬂections and Cooper pair tunneling between the tip

and the sample [Fig. 1(c)]. Successively decreasing the junction impedance highlights the
evolution of distinct features at the characteristic energy of ±∆P b, arising from Andreev
processes in the STM junction [26] as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 1(c). The prominent peak

in conductance at zero bias corresponds to the IV characteristic shown in Fig. 1(d), where
the maximum Cooper pair current Imax occurs at a voltage near zero bias (Vp ≈ 40 µV) due
to a phase ﬂuctuating Josephson supercurrent, discussed in more detail below. Moreover,

we resolve periodic features in both current and conductance that appear at remarkably

regular voltage intervals (95 µeV), which are related to the interaction of the STM Josephson

junction with its electromagnetic environment [Fig. 1(e)]. Finally, we also note that at low

junction impedances, the large injection of quasi-particles results in an increased broadening

of the coherence peaks compared to spectra at higher junction resistance [Fig. 1(c)].

We can understand the spectroscopic features of our STM Josephson junction by com-

paring the magnitude of the three relevant energy scales: (i) the Josephson coupling energy
between the tip and sample, EJ = (∆P b/RN ) · π/(4e2) = /(2e) · Ic, which depends on
the normal state junction resistance RN and the pairing gap ∆P b, (ii) the thermal energy

corresponding to our electron temperature, kBT = 22 µeV, and (iii) the charging energy
EC = (2e)2/2C, which depends on the capacitance C of the junction. For our STM junction
with a typical C ≈ 4 fF, most measurements are performed in a regime where the charging
energy dominates the behavior of the Josephson junction, EJ (cid:46) kBT (cid:28) EC. In this case, the
thermal ﬂuctuation of the phase across the junction are enhanced by quantum ﬂuctuations,

which together result in a shift of the Josephson pair current to non-zero bias [27], as we

observe in our data shown in Fig. 1(d). The oscillations in the conductance at higher bias

[Fig. 1(e)] arise from the interaction between such a phase incoherent Josephson junction

and the standing electromagnetic modes associated with the STM tip. Photon absorption

or emission with energy E = hν = 2eV facilitate Cooper pair tunneling across the STM

junction at non-zero bias, a signature similar to the AC Josephson eﬀect [28, 29]. Treating
our STM setup as an open-ended λ/4 antenna with resonances at νn = (2n + 1) · c/l [28]
allows us to ﬁt the voltage spacing of the oscillations to extract a characteristic frequency
ν0 ≈ 23 GHz, which is intrinsic to our instrument, corresponding to an approximate tip
length l = 3.3 mm. The high quality factor of these oscillations highlight the sensitivity of

the STM Josephson junction to its electromagnetic environment.

A quantitative understanding of our Josephson STM characteristics can be obtained

by using the P(E) theory to model the probability of Cooper pair tunneling across the

junction mediated by its electromagnetic environment [27, 30]. The energy exchange with

the environment as well as thermal eﬀects contribute to inelastic pair tunneling across the

junction. As shown in the ﬁt in Fig. 1(f), we can accurately capture the particular shape

of our spectra using this theory, the details of which are discussed in the Supplementary

Materials. Within this model, both the maximal phase-ﬂuctuating pair current Imax and

the diﬀerential conductance at zero bias dI/dV (V = 0) are proportional to the square of the

intrinsic Josephson critical current, I 2

c [27, 30]. The values that we obtain for the intrinsic
Ic as a function of the normal state junction resistance RN are in good agreement with
calculations from the Ambegaokar-Baratoﬀ formula, Ic = π/(2e)· ∆P b/RN [31], as shown in

Although the small

capacitance of a typical STM junction makes such Josephson junctions phase incoherent,

mapping of the phase-ﬂuctuating pair current at low bias in the STM setup still provides a

direct method for the spatial characterization of the pairing amplitude in a superconducting

sample.

To demonstrate that the Josephson STM technique can probe variations of the order

parameter on the atomic scale, we investigate individual magnetic atoms deposited on the

surface of our Pb(110) substrate. Magnetic impurities on an s-wave superconductor are

the simplest example of pair-breaking defects that are well known to suppress supercon-

ductivity, for instance seen in the suppression of Tc with increasing impurity concentration

[32, 33]. Previous STM spectroscopy has used quasiparticle tunneling to show that magnetic

atoms on a BCS superconductor induce in-gap Shiba states [34–38]; however such LDOS

measurements do not directly probe the superconducting order parameter. To probe the

spatial variation of the pairing strength for this model system, we deposit a sub-monolayer

of Fe adatoms on Pb(110) in situ, at a temperature of about 20 K. As shown in a typical

STM topography [Fig. 2(a)], this low temperature deposition results in the appearance of

features with Angstrom height, which are consistent with individual Fe atoms residing in

two diﬀerent atomic sub-lattice binding sites (types A and B) on the Pb(110) substrate

[Figs. 2(d),(h)].

To probe the pairing amplitude near these magnetic Fe atoms, we perform spectroscopic

measurements using superconducting Pb tips at junction resistances that are low enough to

detect the phase ﬂuctuating Josephson current but high enough to perform STM imaging

without disrupting the adatoms on the surface. As shown in Figs. 2(b),(f), IV measurements

of the two diﬀerent types of Fe adatoms sites show a suppression of the peak in the pair

current Imax near zero bias as compared to the bare substrate, also seen in an analogous

measurement of diﬀerential conductance over the magnetic impurities [Figs. 2(c),(g)]. This

reduction of the phase-ﬂuctuating pair current and conductance is a direct signature of the

local suppression of the pairing amplitude caused by the magnetic impurities, corresponding

to a 10-15% reduction of the critical current Ic on an Fe adatom based on ﬁts to the spectra

(see Supplementary Materials). The precise value of Imax and the zero bias conductance

depend on the superconducting tips and the strength of the exchange coupling between the

impurity and underlying Pb substrate (as is evident from the diﬀerence between type A and

7

B adatoms), but the suppression of the intrinsic critical current is consistent across dozens

of adatoms measured with various diﬀerent Pb tips.

Another measurement that reﬂects the local pairing suppression is mapping the diﬀeren-

tial conductance at zero bias in the vicinity of the Fe defects to probe the spatial variations

of the order parameter. These measurements, shown in Figs. 2(e),(i), demonstrate our key

ﬁnding that this Josephson STM technique can resolve spatial variations of the pairing

amplitude on the atomic scale. Data from additional adatoms showing a suppression of

the order parameter, as well as control experiments that rule out artifacts of tip height

variations are detailed in the Supplementary Materials. Our observation that the pairing

amplitude recovers back to its unperturbed value for the Pb within Angstroms of the mag-

netic adatoms, and not on the scale of the coherence length is consistent with theoretical

predictions [39, 40]. Theory also predicts an oscillating power-law for the order parameter,
∆(r) ∼ sin2(kF r)/(kF r)2 as a function of the distance r from a magnetic impurity, where
kF is the Fermi wavevector [40]. However, both the adatom geometry on the surface of

a 3D superconductor and the short Fermi wavelength in Pb give rise to the short-range

decay of the order parameter, making it diﬃcult to detect these oscillations in the current

experiment.

In contrast, the suppression of the local order parameter is not prominently seen in

quasiparticle tunneling measurements over the magnetic impurity. Superconducting tip

spectra [Fig. 3(a)] over an Fe adatom show a suppression in the intensity of the coherence

peaks with no appreciable shift in their energy as compared to the bare substrate. In the

presence of bound states, the spectral weight is redistributed from the coherence peaks

to the bound state energies, thus the suppression of the local pairing amplitude does not

translate into a shift in the energies of the coherence peaks. Self-consistent calculations

conﬁrm this distinction between measurements of the order parameter and the local density

of states [20, 21]. Thus, our measurements demonstrate the utility of scanning Josephson

spectroscopy in directly extracting local variations of the superconducting order parameter.

Spectroscopic measurements with a superconducting tip can also be used to probe pre-

viously unexplored Andreev reﬂection processes through the in-gap Shiba states localized

near individual magnetic adatoms. Typically, impurity-bound Shiba states are detected in

measurements with superconducting tips through quasi-particle or Andreev tunneling pro-

cesses at an energy of eV = ∆tip + ES, where ES is the energy of the Shiba state [38, 41].

Shiba states, an example of which is shown in Fig. 3(a) for a type A Fe defect, resolving
two diﬀerent Shiba states at e|V | = ∆tip + ES1 and e|V | = ∆tip + ES2. Examining the
dependence of such measurements on the coupling between the superconducting tip and

sample, we ﬁnd that at lower junction resistance, there are additional subgap features in the
spectra at lower biases [Fig. 3(b)]. In particular, we ﬁnd peaks in conductance at e|V | = ES1
and e|V | = (∆P b + ES1)/2, which correspond to previously undetected Andreev reﬂections
through an impurity-bound Shiba state. The feature at e|V | = (∆P b + ES1)/2, which is
due to a sub-gap tunneling process, cannot occur due to quasiparticle tunneling but rather

arises from an Andreev process through the Shiba state, as illustrated in Fig. 3(g). Further

corroboration that such Andreev processes involve the localized Shiba state can be obtained

by comparing the spatial patterns of maps over the impurities at the Andreev reﬂection
energy (e|V | = (∆P b + ES1)/2) with that of tunneling at e|V | = ∆P b + ES1. The excellent
correspondence between the hole-like (electron-like) conductance measurements shown in

Figs. 3(c),(e) (Figs. 3(d),(f)) for the type A impurity demonstrates the role of Shiba states

in such Andreev processes.

(See also Supplementary Material for other examples and a

discussion of possible complications due to imperfect superconducting tips).

In conclusion, we demonstrate that combining Josephson spectroscopy with atomic res-

olution STM imaging provides a method to directly probe the local superconducting order

parameter, which is not directly accessible through traditional quasiparticle measurements.

Despite the challenge of operating such Josephson junctions in a fully phase coherent regime

due to their ultra small dimensions, the ﬂuctuating pair current is still a powerful tool to

examine spatial variations of the pairing amplitude. Our key accomplishment, demonstrat-

ing that these measurements can be performed with atomic resolution, paves the way for

using scanning Josephson techniques to study an inhomogeneous or spatially modulated

order parameter in novel superconducting materials.

FITTING PROCEDURE FOR JOSEPHSON CRITICAL CURRENT

The general tunneling properties of ultrasmall junctions are well described by the P(E)

theory, which can be tailored to the case of Cooper pair tunneling between two supercon-

ducting junctions by treating the Josephson energy as a perturbation to the charging energy
(EJ (cid:28) EC) [1–3]. This theory considers a voltage-biased junction coupled to an arbitrary
environment, where inelastic tunneling processes mediated by the external environment are

characterized by a probability distribution P (E). For STM junctions with a capacitance on

the order of 1 fF, the dynamics are dominated by the charging energy, which gives rise to

quantum ﬂuctuations of the phase. However, photon assisted tunneling of Cooper pairs is

still possible if the environment is able to compensate for the bias by emitting or absorbing

a photon of energy E = 2eV = hν as a Cooper pair tunnels across the junction. Except in

the case of simple environmental impedance functions, it is diﬃcult to obtain an analytic

expression for P(E). We follow a numerical method to compute the probability of Cooper

pair tunneling due to interactions with an environment modeled by a complex impedance

Z(ω), as discussed in [2], using the convolution

PZ(E) = I(E) +

dωK(E, ω)PZ(E − ω).

The inhomogeneity I(E) is given by a Lorentzian representing the eﬀect of the Ohmic

resistance of the environment and serves as an initial guess for P(E). Detailed forms of I(E)

and K(E, ω) are given in [2]. We solve this convolution iteratively until self consistency is

reached.

The data show periodic oscillations in the diﬀerential conductance [Fig. S1(a)], which

we presume arise from standing modes of the tip. We model the STM tip geometry as an

open-ended ﬁnite transmission line, formed between the tip holder and the sample, with
eigenfrequencies corresponding to νn = (2n + 1) · c/l, for an STM tip of length l, where c is
the speed of light [4]. The total impedance seen by the junction is given according to [3]

resonator and δ = ω0RC, the ratio of the λ/4 frequency to the cutoﬀ frequency 1/RC. The

load resistance provides a measure of the eﬀective ohmic impedance seen by the junction,

which is on the order of the vacuum impedance Z0 = 377Ω, largely determined by the wiring.

The dissipative interaction of a quantum system with the environment opens up one path

for photon assisted tunneling as discussed above. Thermal ﬂuctuations on the capacitive

junction create an additional channel for inelastic tunneling of Cooper pairs, where the

voltage noise across the capacitor has an rms

to the electron temperature T = 250 mK, which accounts for extrinsic sources of noise (e.g.

from room temperature electronics; for details of the measurement circuit, see [5]). Since the

resonances of the tip eigenmodes are more clearly resolved in the diﬀerential conductance

for tunneling between a Pb tip and a Pb(110) sample, we ﬁt dI/dV to the derivative of

current calculated from the P(E) theory [Fig. S1(a)]. In order to ﬁt the IV characteristics

of the junction, an additional constant term must be added to account for the background

[Fig. S1(b)], likely arising from quasiparticle poisoning.

Fig. S1(c) shows the linear dependence of the critical current values extracted from the

ﬁt of dI/dV over a range of junction resistances RN . This is in remarkable agreement with

Fit to dI/dV with a Pb tip on a Pb(110) sample for RN = 250 kΩ based on the numerical

implementation of the P(E) theory. Fitting parameters are C = 4.3 fF, RL = 502 Ω and α = 0.15

with the temperature ﬁxed at T = 250 mK. From the overall amplitude of the ﬁt, we obtain a

critical current Ic = 8.25 nA compared to Ic = 8.5 nA from the Ambegaokar-Baratoﬀ formula for

∆P b = 1.35 meV. (b) Calculated I(V) from the dI/dV ﬁtting parameters (blue) demonstrates the

need to include an additional term to account for a quasiparticle background in order to match the
250 kΩ I(V) data. A constant term, which of the form of the form c · 2(Θ(V ) − 0.5) where Θ(x)

is the Heaviside function, is added with c = 6.5 pA (black). (c) For critical currents extracted

assuming the gap is the same for the tip and the sample with ∆P b = 1.35 meV. Thus, even

though we are in the phase ﬂuctuating regime, the incoherent Cooper pair tunneling across

our Josephson STM junction provides a measure of the local order parameter of the system.

The maps in Figs. 2 (main text) and S3 show the zero bias conductance on Pb to be constant

to within in 2-3% (1 standard deviation) of the average value. For measurements performed

with the same superconducting tip, the values of the remaining ﬁt parameters, C, RL, ν0, α,

have a less than 5% variation at diﬀerent junction resistances between 2.5 MΩ and 250 kΩ.

For diﬀerent superconducting tips, the capacitance and resistance show a 10-15% variation,

whereas α can vary by up to 30%.

kΩ with the same superconducting Pb tip. Fit parameters for both panels: C = 4.1 fF, RL = 550 Ω

and α = 0.18. From the overall ﬁt parameter, we obtain values for the critical current, Ic = 4.15

nA on Pb compared to Ic = 3.60 nA on the Fe adatom, indicating a 13% suppression over the

magnetic impurity.

SUPPRESSION OF THE JOSEPHSON EFFECT OVER FE ADATOMS

A quantitative treatment of the suppression of the Josephson critical current over an Fe

adatom can be obtained by comparing ﬁts to the conductance over the impurity to that

on clean Pb. Fig. S2(a)-(b) shows an example ﬁt to dI/dV for Pb and a type A impurity

measured with the same superconducting tip, demonstrating a 13% suppression of Ic. Over-

all, we ﬁnd a 10-15% suppression of the critical current over the Fe impurity for dozens of

adatoms (both type A and type B) measured with various diﬀerent superconducting tips at

several junction resistances.

Next, we present data from two additional adatoms and discuss several measurements

that rule out variations in tip-sample distance as a cause for the suppression of the criti-

cal current. We simultaneously establish the junction resistance well outside the gap and

perform spectroscopic measurements of the Josephson eﬀect on the Fe adatoms. The park-

ing conditions (setpoint current and voltage) that determine RN are identical both on the

bare Pb as well as over the Fe adatoms, ensuring there is no positional variation in RN .

Moreover, we note that the magnitude of suppression we observe makes it highly unlikely

that the change in z-height is responsible for the reduction of the Josephson eﬀect. Since

tip height would lead to an order of magnitude decrease in the intrinsic Josephson critical

current. In contrast, we observe only a 10-15% suppression of the Josephson critical current

over the Fe adatoms, which shows that it is not related to an increased distance from the

Pb(110) surface.

Spectroscopic maps of the zero bias diﬀerential conductance at RN = 1 MΩ, taken
with the same superconducting tip at two diﬀerent parking biases of V = −5 mV and
V = −20 mV are shown in Fig. S3(a)-(d). In order to maintain the same junction resistance,
the setpoint current is four times as large in the second measurement (I = 5 nA and I = 20

nA, respectively). Both data sets show similar conductance values and identical spatial

patterns for zero bias suppression, conﬁrming that the Ic suppression is not due to spurious

signals arising from diﬀerences in the density of states outside the gap over the bare Pb

compared to the adatoms. The slight discrepancy in absolute conductance values is likely
due to the fact that the V = −20 mV parking bias is well outside strong-coupling energy
regime in Pb, whereas the phonon modes are still present at V = −5 mV. Fig. S3(e)-(h)
compares zero bias diﬀerential conductance maps taken at the same parking bias of V = -5

mV for two diﬀerent junction resistances, RN = 500 kΩ and RN = 250 kΩ, corresponding to

a diﬀerence in tip-sample distance between the two data sets, and a decrease in tip height

relative to the 1 MΩ measurements. The two measurements show similar spatial patterns

and a similar percentage suppression of the zero bias conductance over the adatom, though

the absolute conductance values diﬀer by the expected amount based on RN . Given the

exponential sensitivity of tunneling current to tip height, a factor of four variation in the

junction impedance is considerable. Therefore, we rule out measurement artifacts from z-

height variations and attribute the reduction in Ic to the suppression of the superconducting

order parameter over the magnetic impurities.

ANDREEV REFLECTIONS THROUGH IMPURITY-BOUND SHIBA STATES

Here we provide additional data on Andreev reﬂections through the localized Shiba states

of Fe adatoms on a Pb(110) surface. The Shiba states measured with a superconducting

tip for the type B Fe adatom are shown in Fig. S4(a), where the presence of the impurity

also changes the coupling of the tip into the two gaps of Pb(110). Fig. S4(b) shows the

the suppression of the zero bias conductance is identical, and the slight discrepancies in absolute

conductance values is likely due to the phonon modes in Pb. (e)-(h) Simultaneous topographies

and diﬀerential conductance maps over a second Fe adatom with the same tip (but diﬀerent than

evolution of subgap Andreev processes as the junction resistance is decreased. The Andreev
reﬂections that give rise to the peaks at eV = ±∆P b and eV = ±(∆P b + ES)/2 are discussed
in the main text [inset of Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 3(g)].

The schematic in Fig. S4(g)-(h) depicts two processes which could give rise to the feature
in the conductance at e|V | = ES. An Andreev process at the Shiba state energy would in-
volve an electron (hole) sourced from the Shiba state to be retroreﬂected as a hole (electron)

back into the same state. On the other hand, an imperfect tip with some non-zero DOS

up to EF could give rise to direct quasiparticle tunneling into the Shiba state. We expect

that an Andreev process should get stronger for larger tip-sample coupling (smaller junction

For the type

A adatom [main text Fig. 3(b)], the peak in dI/dV at ES persists even for high resistances

(RN > 1M Ω), an indication that the peak arises from a combination of quasiparticle and

Andreev tunneling processes. However it is not possible to obtain direct quasiparticle tun-
neling at a threshold bias of e|V | = (∆P b + ES)/2, which can arise only through Andreev
reﬂections where an electron from the Shiba state is reﬂected as a hole into the continuum.

Fig. S4(c)-(f) show that the spatial patterns of the Shiba states for the Type B adatom at
a bias of eV = ±(∆P b + ES1) have a striking similarity to ones at the Andreev reﬂection
process of eV = ±(∆P b + ES1)/2, corroborating the role of the Shiba state in the Andreev
process.
