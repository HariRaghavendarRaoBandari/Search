Abstract

Single photon sources are of paramount importance in quantum communication, quantum com-

putation, and quantum metrology. In particular, there is great interest to realize scalable solid state

platforms that can emit triggered photons on demand to achieve scalable nanophotonic networks.

We report on a visible-spectrum single photon emitter in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC). The emitter is

photostable at room- and low-temperature enabling photon counts per second (cps) in excess of
2×106 from unpatterned, bulk SiC. It exists in two orthogonally polarized states, which have par-

allel absorption and emission dipole orientations. Low temperature measurements reveal a narrow

zero phonon line (linewidth < 0.1 nm) that accounts for > 30 % of the total photoluminescence

spectrum.

INTRODUCTION

Eﬃcient, on-demand, and robust single photon emitters (SPEs) are of central impor-

tance to many areas of quantum information processing [1]. Color centers in high-bandgap

semiconductors have emerged as excellent SPEs [2, 3] that can operate even at room temper-

ature. These include atomic defects in diamond [4], zinc oxide [5], and single rare earth ions

[6] in garnets. Color centers in silicon carbide (SiC) and diamond provide optical access to

internal spin states [7, 8], which can be used as quantum memories for quantum computing

[9], quantum-enhanced sensing, and other quantum technologies [10, 11].

SiC is a technologically important material that is widely used in optoelectronics, high

power electronics, and microelectromechanical systems [12]. It is commercially available in

up to 6-inch wafers, and processes for device engineering are well developed [13]. Recently,

many SPEs were reported in SiC, which were attributed to the carbon antisite-vacancy pair

[14], silicon vacancies [8, 15, 16], and di-vacancies [17–19].

Here, we report on an exceptionally photostable and bright SPE in the hexagonal (4H)

SiC polytype with a photoluminescence (PL) in the visible spectrum. Despite the high

index of SiC (2.65 at 600 nm [20]) and the associated total internal reﬂection, we measure a
saturated photon count rate of up to 2×106 cps from individual emitters, representing the
brightest SPE from an unpatterned bulk semiconductor, to our knowledge. The emitter is

exceptionally photostable: we observe no blinking at time scales between 100 µs to minutes,

and no degradation in the PL properties after months of imaging the same emitter.

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS

For our experiments, we use a semi-insulating high purity (resistivity of more than

100 kΩcm) single crystal 4H-SiC 3” wafer with a thickness of 350 µm (W4TRE0R-0200,
CREE, Inc). The top surface is the {0001} ± 0.25◦ crystal plane. Fig. 1(a) shows the
4H SiC lattice structure, which is characterized by sequential layers ABCB, where (A,B,C)

denote the SiC bilayer structures, composed of 3 atoms connected by two bonds (Si-C-Si),

that form the basis of any SiC polytype. Layers A and B diﬀer only in a lattice shift whereas
layer C describes a lattice twist by 60◦.

The sample was annealed in forming gas (H2:N → 1:19) at ambient pressure at 600◦C.

characteristic ﬁrst-order longitudinal optical Raman mode (labeled in the spectrum as (cid:63)) and the

second-order Raman modes (labeled as (cid:63)(cid:63)).

Irradiating the sample with electrons (density: 1017 e−cm−2, energy: 10 MeV) before an-
nealing increased the emitter density by ∼ 2×.

Photoluminescence at Room Temperature

After the annealing step, scanning confocal microscopy revealed individual color centers
emitting in a broad spectrum covering ∼ 580 − 700 nm, as shown in Fig. 1(b,c) under laser
excitation (532 nm, 0.5 mW on sample) with a 560 nm long-pass ﬁlter. The PL was collected

with a 0.9 NA microscope objective (Nikon) and detected on avalanche photo diodes (APD)

via single mode ﬁbers. Antibunched photon emission was conﬁrmed by Hanbury Brown

Twiss interferometry, as described below. Our measurements showed no evidence of blinking

at time scales from 100 µs to several minutes, and the emission is stable for hours under

continuous laser excitation.

The room-temperature PL spectra extend from ∼ 590 − 700 nm (∼ 1.77 − 2.1 eV), with
energy shifts up to ±50 meV between diﬀerent emitters. This can be seen from Fig. 1(c),
which plots the individually normalized PL spectra of the three characteristic emitters E1,
E2, E3 labeled in Fig. 1(b). The small PL peaks between ∼ 580 − 590 nm are also visible
in the background spectrum, shown in the green curve in Fig. 1(c), and are ascribed to

second-order Raman shifts [21] (Supplement 1).

We attribute the peaks at 584.8 nm (E1), 597.3 nm (E2), and 609.6 nm (E3), as the room-

temperature ZPLs of these emitters, though the assignment is less clear for E1 because of

the proximity to the Raman peaks.

Level System

For a better understanding of internal electron dynamics and the level structure, we

measured the photon statistics of the emitter with a Hanbury Brown Twiss (HBT) interfer-

ometer. These measurements will focus on the blue shifted emitter, E1, and the red shifted

emitter, E3, as exemplary of the broad emitter distribution. Figs. 2(a,b) show the normal-

ized second-order autocorrelation histograms (g(2)(τ ), Eq. 2) without background correction,

which conﬁrm that the emission is dominated by a single emitter (g(2)(0) < 0.5). The insets

show a magniﬁed region near τ = 0. These histograms indicate a strong bunching for E3,

but only a weak bunching for E1. These photon bunching features suggest the presence of

a dark metastable state, as analyzed below.

We use rate equation analysis to model these autocorrelation measurements. A 2-level

model cannot capture the bunching behavior near τ = 0. A 3-level model with pump-

power dependent transition rates does capture the essential features of the second-order

autocorrelation histograms, as seen in the green-curve ﬁts in Fig. 2(a,b). This 3-level model

allows direct comparison with other well-studied emitters, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV)

center in diamond [22] and the carbon antisite-vacancy pair in SiC [14].

The 3-level system considered here consists of ground (|g(cid:105)), excited (|e(cid:105)), and metastable

5

(|m(cid:105)) states, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). These states are coupled by the transition rates

Eq. 1 describes a typical 3-level system with the transition rates (γij between diﬀerent

levels i, j  (g, e, m) with time dependent populations pi) [23]. Electronic transitions in Fig.

3(a) account for contributions from excitation (γge), radiative (γeg), as well as non-radiative
decays (γem, γmg). The transitions from the ground state to the metastable state (|g(cid:105) → |m(cid:105):
γgm ≈ 0) and from the metastable state to the excited state (|m(cid:105) → |e(cid:105): γme ≈ 0) are
assumed to be insigniﬁcant and are therefore neglected.

Calculations in Supplement 1 of the decay ratio, radiative and non-radiative decays, reveal

that more than 90 % of all decays are radiative. Assuming that the transition rate between
|g(cid:105) and |e(cid:105) is signiﬁcantly more dominant than the decay rate from |e(cid:105) and |m(cid:105) (γeg (cid:29) γem),
which is supported by the calculations in Supplement 1, g(2)(τ ) for a 3-level system can be

expressed in a ﬁrst order approximation as g(2)(τ ) = limt→∞ pe(τ )/pe(t) [24–26].

Evaluation of the latter approximation of g(2)(τ ) using Eq. 1 and the initial condition of

the occupation of the ground state (pg(0) = 1) results in Eq. 2 with ﬁtting parameters: τ1,

τ2, and α.

g2(τ ) ≈ 1 − (1 + α) exp(− τ
τ1

) + α exp(− τ
τ2

).

(2)

Fitting parameter τ1 describes an approximated 2-level system considering transitions

between the ground and excited state. Assuming a single excited state, τ1 can be linearly

approximated as indicated in Fig. 2(e). At zero optical excitation power (Popt = 0), τ1 can

be considered as the lifetime of the excited state [24, 26]. The linear ﬁt in Fig. 2(e) yields
a lifetime for E1 (E3) of about 3.33 ±0.2 ns (4.4 ±0.3 ns).

The second ﬁtting parameter, τ2, reﬂects the behavior of the metastable state. The ﬁt in
Fig. 2(f) reveals a lifetime, τ2(0), of the metastable state of 675 ±100 ns (900 ±200 ns) for
E1 (E3).

The third parameter of Eq. 2, α, plotted in Fig. 2(g) for E1 and E3, represents a ﬁtting

parameter to account for the non-radiative transitions via the metastable state and required

for derivation of the emitters rate equations in Supplement 1.

Additional ﬂuorescence lifetime measurements support the 3-level model. Under pulsed
excitation an excited state will decay exponentially (I(t) = exp (−t/τ )). A single exponential
equation ﬁts the decay rate of one single state with a time-dependent PL intensity term,

I(t), and with a ﬁtting parameter τ which represents the lifetime of the spectrally detectable

excited state. Fig. 3(b) shows the excited state lifetime measurement (wavelength: 532 nm,

pulse length: 1 ns, frequency: 40 MHz). The optimized single-exponential ﬁt indicates that
there is only one excited state with a lifetime of 3.45 ±0.1 ns for E1 and 4.65 ±0.3 ns for E3.
The measured lifetimes diﬀer with the obtained ﬁtting of τ1 and τ2 of the power dependent

g2(τ ), shown in Fig. 2(e), by only 0.2 ns well within the error, supporting that a 3-level

system is a suitable model for the investigated emitters.

Photoluminescence Intensity

We studied the polarization absorption and emission properties by exciting the emitters

with linearly polarized light. Fig. 3(c) shows a polar plot of the excitation polarization-

dependent PL intensity (without background subtraction) of E1 ﬁtted with a quadratic
sinusoidal ﬁt function, sin2(θ + φ) consisting of an angular parameter θ, representing the

rotation of the linear polarization of the pump laser, and φ, the orientation of the emitter,

relative to an arbitrary axis. The histogram in Fig. 4(b) summarizes these polarization

measurements repeated for more than 20 emitters, which reveals only two linear polarization
states deﬁned as φ1 = 45◦ and φ2 = 135◦.

A comparison between the obtained count rates with parallel and orthogonal, linear laser

excitation relative to the emitter polarization, hence the minimum and maximum count

rates in the polar plot in Fig. 3(c), reveals that all emitters are almost perfectly situated

in a parallel plane to the sample surface, the basal plane. More advanced measurements

and calculations of the spatial orientation, further explained in Supplement 1, support that

the emitters polarization is almost in parallel to the basal plane, which are the orthogonal

planes to the c-axis, indicated in Fig. 1(a).

We next studied the maximum emission rates of E1 and E3 with optimized excitation

polarization. Fig. 3(d) shows the saturation behavior of both emitters and the associated

background based on second-order autocorrelation histograms. The g2(0) based background

measurements reveal single photon characteristics for both emitters up to excitation powers

of 1 mW. To optimize the photon collection eﬃciency, these measurements were performed

on a diﬀerent confocal setup (Nikon, oil immersion, 1.3 NA, dichroic ﬁlter with cut-oﬀ

wavelength of 552 nm, 560 nm longpass ﬁlter). The emission was equally distributed between

two APDs to avoid saturation of the detectors.

Eq. 3, describing the measured power-dependent (Popt) emission count rate (RF IT ), is

the common function for 3-level systems to ﬁt the power-dependent intensity measurements

plotted in Fig. 3(d). The equation consists of collection and excitation eﬃciency parameters,

ηEX respectively ηCOL, a linear power dependent background slope (α), and a constant

parameter for dark counts (β).

As seen in Fig. 3(d) the emitters exhibit high brightness with more than one million cps

detected on each APD. The calculated saturation counts and corresponding power of E1 are
estimated to be at 1.942×106 cps and 0.425 mW and 1.154 million cps and 0.78 mW for E3.
To our knowledge, these are the brightest emitters in any bulk material reported to date,

and among the brightest SPEs even if compared to color centers in diamond nanocrystals

[27, 28]. Furthermore, these emitters are an order of magnitude brighter than a standard

single NV center in a bulk diamond and comparable to a NV center enhanced via an optical

nanostructure [29]. By extrapolation the determined count rates for collection eﬃciency
enhancing nanostructures [30], we estimate single photon count rates of about 20×106 cps.

Photoluminescence at Cryogenic Temperatures

We performed low-temperature (18 K sample temperature) PL measurements in a closed-

cycle Janis cryostat to study phonon coupling characteristics.

Fig. 4(a) shows low-temperature PL spectra of the three introduced emitters in Fig.

1(c). Common to all low temperature spectra is a strong peak which we attribute to the
zero phonon line (ZPL) and a red shifted (∼ 8 nm) phonon broadened peak indicated in the
magniﬁed cut out in Fig. 4(a). The ZPL emission wavelengths are illustrated in 4(b) as a
histogram and reveal a spread from ∼ 575 − 610 nm. There is no recognizable dependence
between ZPL and polarization state.

Temperature dependent ZPL linewidth broadening reveals information about the dephas-

ing mechanisms of the emitters, as well as the inﬂuence of the host crystal on the defects.

Fig. 4(c) shows the temperature dependence of the emitter linewidth of the most dominant

peak of E1 at 581.4 nm approximated with Lorentzian ﬁt functions. At 18 K we determine
a linewidth of 0.095 ±0.05 nm, not limited by the spectrometer resolution (< 0.1 nm). The
lines were stable over the measurement period, and no diﬀusion or blinking on the ms time

scale was observed. The linewidth broadening with increasing temperature ﬁts very well

with a T 3 function, similar to the silicon vacancy and other defects in diamond [28]. This

is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the T 5 dependence of the NV color center in diamond that

originates from the dynamic Jahn-Teller eﬀect [31].

polarization of various room-temperature emitters at diﬀerent wavelength recorded at cryogenic

temperatures. (c) The linewidth broadening with increasing temperature of the dominant peak at

581.4 nm (E1, blue squares) shows a T3 (green) trend.

The population of the phonon side band (PSB), expressed in Eq. 4 by the Debye-Waller

factor (DW F ), can be estimated with the ratio of the ZPL PL emission, IZP L, relative to

the total PL emission, IT OT = IZP L + IP SB, the combination of the ZPL PL emission with

the phonon broadened PL, IP SB. The DW F is calculated by separately ﬁtting the zero

phonon line and phonon side band (PSB) peaks with Lorentzian ﬁt functions (Igor ProTM

6.36).

(4)

At cryogenic temperatures we determine for E1 a DW F of 33 ± 1 %. NV color centers
yield a DW F of only about 3 % [22] but the silicon-vacancy center in diamonds has a DW F

of more than 70 % [32]. A higher DW F is preferential to achieve better single photon

emission characteristics [33] and could be directly enhanced via coupling to an optical cavity

10

[30].

DISCUSSION

Finally, we discuss the origin of these emitters. We attribute the investigated SPEs to the

same emitter type due to similar low- and room-temperature PL spectra, the linear polar-

ization data, and the matching of a 3-level system as the underlying model. We denote the

emitter type as intrinsic due to the high density of emitters in high-purity SiC. Furthermore,

the SPEs are observed in both electron irradiated and un-irradiated, annealed samples, with

a higher density after electron irradiation.

To ﬁnd a possible origin of the emitter, three major indicators are considered: (1) The

investigated SPEs spectral components are in the red visible range. (2) To create photostable
SPEs, it is necessary to anneal the SiC samples in an inert environment of at least 600◦ C.
There is no observation of degradation regarding photostability or changes in emitter density
up to annealing temperatures of at least 900◦ C. (3) There are two linear polarization states.

In the red visible spectral range, two SPEs in 4H-SiC are known and have been char-

acterized, the carbon antisite-vacancy pair, characterized by Castelletto et al.

[14], and

a so far unknown emitter type, reported by Lohrmann et al.

[34], presumably hosted by

6H-SiC inclusions. The carbon antisite-vacancy pair diﬀers from the measured results espe-

cially by a red-shifted ﬁrst ZPL (648.5 nm), a shorter excited state lifetime, and a stronger

irradiation-density dependence. In contrast to the described SPE, the latter, yet uniden-
tiﬁed emitter type exists in three diﬀerent linear polarization states (φ1 = 30◦, φ2 = 90◦,
φ3 = 150◦) instead of two. Furthermore, its ZPLs are distributed over a broader spectrum
(∼ 550 − 750 nm) and the saturated PL intensity is signiﬁcantly smaller.

We exclude, as possible underlying defect structures, single carbon (C) and silicon (Si)
vacancies, since the C vacancies tend to anneal out at temperatures above 500◦ C [35] and the
Si vacancies [8, 15, 16] are in the NIR. The DI-defect [36], DII-defect [37], and di-vacancies

[17] show optical signatures in diﬀerent spectral ranges which eliminates them as possible

emitter origins. Antisites, which are replaced Si (C) atoms by C (Si) atoms, show very

low formation energies, hence, they are the most common defects in SiC [38]. Nevertheless,
annealing temperatures around ∼ 200 − 300◦ C cause antisites to become mobile and they
In conclusion, none of the yet optically characterized emitters or
eventually recombine.

described defect structures in 4H-SiC seems to match the observed and measured features

of the emitter.

Based on the conﬂict between the possible polarization states in hexagonal polytype hosts
(60◦ separation between states, apparent in Fig. 1(a)) and the two observed orthogonal
polarization states of the emitter, we propose a polytype inclusion. In the case of 3C-SiC

just a single plane needs to be skipped and the violation in terms of the polarization is

resolved [39]. During the production of SiC wafers by Cree inc. epitaxy defects such as

3C inclusions can be incorporated, in particular where the step-ﬂow was interrupted during

epitaxy layer growth [40].

CONCLUSION

We described an exceptionally bright, visible-spectrum single photon emitter in silicon
carbide. The emitters exhibit count rates up to 2×106 cps at saturation at room-temperature
— making them the brightest source of single photons from unpatterned bulk material. The

emitters are abundant in a non-irradiated, annealed high purity 4H-SiC sample. Further-

more, their full polarization, narrow linewidth, and stability under constant laser excitation

are promising attributes for applications in integrated nanophotonic technologies.
