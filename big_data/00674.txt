THEOREM FOR SLOWLY MOVING PERIODIC TARGETS

RISTO KORHONEN*, NAN LI, AND KAZUYA TOHGE

Abstract. We extend the diﬀerence analogue of Cartan’s second main the-
orem for the case of slowly moving periodic hyperplanes, and introduce two
diﬀerent natural ways to ﬁnd a diﬀerence analogue of the truncated second
main theorem. As applications, we obtain a new Picard type theorem and
diﬀerence analogues of the deﬁciency relation for holomorphic curves.

1. Introduction

In 1933, Cartan [1] obtained a generalization of the second main theorem to
holomorphic curves. Cartan’s result is a natural extension of Nevanlinna’s second
main theorem for the n-dimensional complex projective space, and it has, somewhat
surprisingly, turned out to be a powerful tool for important problems in the complex
plane as well. Examples of such problems appear in relation to considering Fermat-
type equations, and Waring’s problem for analytic functions, etc. A thorough
review due to Gundersen and Hayman of the applications of Cartan’s second main
theorem to the complex plane can be found in [4]. See, for instance, also [10,
11] for detailed presentations of Cartan’s value distribution theory, and [2, 9] for
Nevanlinna theory.

Diﬀerence analogues of Cartan’s second main theorem have been recently ob-
tained, independently, by Halburd, Korhonen and Tohge [8], and by Wong, Law
and Wong [12]. In order to state the Cartan second main theorem for diﬀerences,
we deﬁne the n-dimensional complex projective space Pn as the quotient space

(cid:0)Cn+1 \ {0}(cid:1)/ ∼, where

if and only if

(a0, a1, . . . , an) ∼ (b0, b1, . . . , bn)

(a0, a1, . . . , an) = λ(b0, b1, . . . , bn)

for some λ ∈ C \ {0}. The Cartan characteristic function of a holomorphic curve

g = [g0 : · · · : gn] : C → Pn ,

or its associated system of n + 1 entire functions gj,

G := (g0, . . . , gn) : C → Cn+1 \ {0} ,

Here g0, . . . , gn are entire functions such that for all complex numbers z the quantity
max0≤k≤n |gk(z)| is non-zero, that is, the gj’s have no common zeros in the whole
of C. We call the holomorphic map G a reduced representation of the curve g. The
hyper-order of g is deﬁned by

ς(g) = lim sup

r→∞

log log Tg(r)

log r

.

Let c ∈ C, and let P 1

c be the ﬁeld of period c meromorphic functions deﬁned
in C of hyper-order strictly less than one. The following theorem is a diﬀerence
analogue of Cartan’s result, where the ramiﬁcation term has been replaced by a
quantity expressed in terms of the Casorati determinant of functions which are
linearly independent over a ﬁeld of periodic functions.

Theorem 1.1 ([8]). Let n ≥ 1, and let g0, . . . , gn be entire functions, linearly
independent over P 1
c , such that max{|g0(z)|, . . . , |gn(z)|} > 0 for each z ∈ C, and

ς := ς(g) < 1,

g = [g0 : · · · : gn].

Let ε > 0. If f0, . . . , fq are q + 1 linear combinations over C of the n + 1 functions
g0, . . . , gn, where q > n, such that any n + 1 of the q + 1 functions f0, . . . , fq are
linearly independent over P 1

c , and

then

measure (i.e. RE∩[1,∞) dt/t < ∞).

Comparing the operators Df = f ′ and ∆f = f (z + 1)− f (z), a natural diﬀerence
analogue of constant targets for f ′ is the periodic targets case for ∆f . For instance,
linear diﬀerential equations with constant coeﬃcients can be exactly solved modulo
arbitrary constants, while for linear diﬀerence equations the same statement is true
but with arbitrary periodic functions. Also, as shown in [7], the natural target
space for the second main theorem in the complex plane is the solution space of

L(f ) = 0,

where L is a linear operator mapping a subclass N of the meromorphic functions
in C into itself. Taking L(f ) = Df gives constants as targets, while the choice
L(f ) = ∆f yields periodic functions. Also, as in the above Theorem 1.1, the
condition “entire functions g1, g2, . . . , gp linearly independent over C” is changed
naturally into “linearly independent over P 1
c ”. A natural diﬀerence analogue of
Cartan’s second main theorem would therefore be for slowly moving periodic target
hyperplanes, rather than constants as is the case in Theorem 1.1. In this paper we
remedy this situation by introducing the following theorem.

Theorem 1.2. Let n ≥ 1, and let g = [g0 : . . . : gn] be a holomorphic curve of C
into Pn(C) with ς := ς(g) < 1, where g0, . . . , gn are linearly independent over P 1
c .

In Section 4 below we will show how Theorem 1.2 leads to two diﬀerence ana-
logues of the truncated second main theorem, which are based on natural discrete
versions of properties of the derivative function. Now, we will show that Theo-
rem 1.2 implies the diﬀerence analogue of the second main theorem obtained in
[6, Theorem 2.5] in the general case of slowly moving periodic targets.
(Theo-
rem 1.1 implies only the special case of constant targets.) To this end, let w be
a non-periodic meromorphic function of hyper-order ς(w) < 1. Let g0 and g1 be
linearly independent entire functions with no common zeros such that w = g0/g1.
Let aj be c-periodic meromorphic functions that are small with respect to w for all
j = 0, . . . , q − 1. Denote

aj =

αj
βj

,

j ∈ {0, . . . , q − 1},

where αj and βj are c-periodic entire functions, and deﬁne fj = βjg0 − αjg1 and
fq = g1. Then Theorem 1.2 yields

(q − 1)Tg(r) ≤ N(cid:18)r,

L(cid:19) − N (r, L) + o(Tg(r))

L =

and r approaches inﬁnity outside of a set of ﬁnite logarithmic measure. The count-

ing function eN in the diﬀerence analogue of the second main theorem is deﬁned in

[6] by

eN(cid:18)r,

according to multiplicity of a at z0 minus the order of zero of ∆cw := w(z +c)−w(z)
at z0. By combining (1.4) with (1.5), it follows that

whereen(r, a) is the number of a-points of w with multiplicity of w(z0) = a counted
∆cw(cid:19) + o(T (r, w))
(q − 1)T (r, w) ≤ eN (r, w) +

where N0(r, 1/∆cw) is the counting function of those zeros of ∆cw which do not
coincide with any of the zeros or poles of w − aj, and r approaches inﬁnity outside
of a set of ﬁnite logarithmic measure. We have therefore shown that [6, Theorem
2.5] follows from Theorem 1.2

The remainder of the paper is organized in the following way. Section 2 contains
a key result (see Theorem 2.1 below) on linear combinations of entire functions
over the ﬁeld of meromorphic functions, which is a crucial tool in the proof of
Theorem 1.2 in Section 5. Applications of the diﬀerence analogue of Cartan’s
theorem to Picard’s theorem are in Section 3, while deﬁciencies and diﬀerence
analogues of the truncated second main theorem can be found in Section 4.

2. Zeros of linear combinations of entire functions

One of the key problems in the proof of Theorem 1.2 has to do with ﬁnding a lower
bound for linear combinations of entire functions over the ﬁeld of small functions
in terms of moduli of their base functions. In the case of constant coeﬃcients [4,
Lemma 8.2] yields the desired results, but for non-autonomous linear combinations
the situation becomes much more delicate due to possible poles and zeros of the
coeﬃcients. The key idea, which enables an applicable result needed for the proof
of Theorem 1.2, is to formulate the estimate using a positive real valued function
A(z) for which the proximity function

m(r, A) =Z 2π

0

log+ |A(reiθ)|

can be evaluated as m(r, A) = o(Tg(r)), despite of the fact that A is not meromor-
phic. The zeros of the coeﬃcients in the linear combinations can then be included
in a small error term of the growth o(Tg(r)). The exact formulation is as follows.

Theorem 2.1. Let n ≥ 1, and let g = [g0 : . . . : gn] be a holomorphic curve of C
into Pn(C), where g0, . . . , gn are linearly independent over P 1

c . If

fj =

aijgi

j = 0, . . . , q, q > n,

nXi=0

where aij are entire functions satisfying T (r, aij) = o(Tg(r)), such that any n + 1
of the q + 1 functions f0, . . . , fq are linearly independent over P 1
c , then there exists
a positive real valued function A(z), such that

(2.1)

|gj(z)| ≤ A(z) · |fmν (z)|,

where 0 ≤ j ≤ n, 0 ≤ ν ≤ q − n, m(r, A) = o(Tg(r)) and the integers m0, . . . , mq
are chosen so that

(2.2)

|fm0(z)| ≥ |fm1(z)| ≥ · · · ≥ |fmq (z)|.

In particular, there exist at least q − n + 1 functions fj that do not vanish at z
for all r outside of a set of ﬁnite logarithmic measure, and moreover the integrated
counting function N ∗(r) of common zeros of more than n functions fj satisﬁes
(2.3)

N ∗(r) = o(Tg(r)).

The following lemma due to G. G. Gundersen [3], which is used to prove The-
orem 2.1, is an estimation of the logarithmic measure about the total moduli of
the zeros and poles of a meromorphic function. Its statement and proof have been
embedded as a part of the proof of [3, Theorem 3].

Lemma 2.2 ([3]). Let f (z) be a meromorphic function, and let Ef := {r : z ∈
C, |z| = r, f (z) = 0 or f (z) = ∞}. Then the set Ef is of ﬁnite logarithmic measure.

Proof of Theorem 2.1. The ﬁrst part of the proof follows the basic idea behind
the proof of [4, Lemma 8.2]. At the end we need to use other methods to ﬁnd
an estimate for the proximity function of A(z), and to deal with the zeros of the
coeﬃcient functions in the linear combinations.

Since each fj is a linear combination of the functions g0, . . . , gn with small

coeﬃcients,

(2.4)

fj =

nXi=0

aijgi

j = 0, . . . , q, q > n,

where T (r, aij) = o(Tg(r)). For each z, let m0, m1, . . . , mq be the integers in (2.2),
which depend on z, and let ν be any ﬁxed integer satisfying 0 ≤ ν ≤ q − n. Then

(2.5)

|fmµ (z)| ≤ |fmν (z)|, µ = q − n, q − n + 1, . . . , q,

and letting {i0, . . . , in} ⊂ {0, . . . , q}, it follows from (2.4) that

fik (z) =

Since g0, . . . , gn and fi0, . . . , fin are linearly independent over C (since C ⊂ P 1
c ),
we get di0...in (z) 6≡ 0. Otherwise, since fi0 , . . . , fin can be expressed by using
g0, . . . , gn, from (2.6) we would have

But from di0...in (z) ≡ 0 and from the fact that fi0 , . . . , fin are linearly independent,
we have a contradiction. Thus di0...in (z) 6≡ 0 as we claimed.

m(r, A(z)) ≤

qXk=q−n

m(r, cmkj(z)) = o(Tg(r)).

Next we prove that A(z) is non-zero for all z ∈ C. From the assumption
that g = [g0 : . . . : gn] is a holomorphic curve of C into Pn(C), we have that
max{|g0(z)|, . . . , |gn(z)|} > 0 for all z ∈ C. Since fik (z) (k = 0, . . . , n) are en-
tire functions, it clearly follows that |fmν (z)| gives a ﬁnite real number for all
z ∈ C.
If there exists z0 ∈ C such that A(z0) = 0, then from (2.10), we have
that |gj(z0)| = 0 for all j = 0, 1, . . . , n, which contradicts with the fact that
max{|g0(z)|, . . . , |gn(z)|} > 0. Thus A(z) 6= 0 for all z ∈ C.

Finally, we will prove that there exist at least q − n + 1 functions fj that do not
vanish at z for all r outside of a set of ﬁnite logarithmic measure. To this end we
deﬁne the sets

0, . . . , n) are analytic on C\A. ThereforePn

For all z ∈ C\A, we get di0...in (z) 6= 0. Thus from (2.8), we have that cikj(z)(k, j =
k=q−n |cmkj(z)| gives a ﬁnite real
number for all z ∈ C\A. If there exists a z0 ∈ C\A such that |fmν (z0)| = 0 for any
ν = 0, . . . , q − n, then from (2.10), we deduce that |gj(z0)| = 0 for all j = 0, 1, . . . , n,
which contradicts with the assumption that

max{|g0(z)|, . . . , |gn(z)|} > 0.

Thus |fmν (z0)| 6= 0 for all ν ∈ {0, . . . , q − n}.

If z0 ∈ A, then there may be a zero of fmν (z) at z = z0 but the order of this
zero is bounded by the order of the zero of di0...in (z) at z = z0. By going through
all points z ∈ A, and taking into account that T (r, di0...in ) = o(Tg(r)), we obtain
(2.3). This completes the proof of Theorem 2.1.
(cid:3)

3. Picard’s theorem

As an application of the diﬀerence analogue of Cartan’s theorem, in [8] Hal-
burd, Korhonen and Tohge obtained a diﬀerence analogue of Picard’s theorem for
holomorphic curves.

Theorem 3.1 ([8]). Let f : C → Pn be a holomorpic curve such that ς(f ) < 1,
let c ∈ C and let p ∈ {1, . . . , n + 1}. If n + p hyperplanes in general position have
forward invariant preimages under f with respect to the translation τ (z) = z + c,
then the image of f is contained in a projective linear subspace over P 1
c of dimension
≤ [n/p].

Here a preimage of a hyperplane H ⊂ Pn under f is said to be forward invariant

with respect to the translation τc(z) = z + c if

τc(f −1({H})) ⊂ f −1({H})

(3.1)
where f −1({H}) and τc(f −1({H})) are multisets in which each point is repeated
according to its multiplicity. Finitely many exceptional values are allowed in the
inclusion (3.1) if the holomorphic curve f is transcendental.

As mentioned in the introduction, a natural diﬀerence analogue of Picard’s the-
orem would have periodic moving targets. In order to state our generalization to
that direction, we ﬁrst need to deﬁne what do we exactly mean by a moving periodic
hyperplane.

First, we ﬁx the numbers n and q(≥ n), and observe q moving hyperplanes

Hj(z) associated with aj = (cid:0)aj0(z), . . . , ajn(z)(cid:1). Let us put Q := {0, . . . , q} and

N := {0, . . . , n} for convenience. By K we denote a ﬁeld containing all the ajk(z)
(j ∈ Q, k ∈ N ) and also C, where ajk(z) are c-periodic entire functions.

Let H(z) be an arbitrary moving hyperplane over the ﬁeld K in Pn, that is, a

hyperplane given by

(3.2)

H(z) =n[x0 : · · · : xn] ∈ Pn : a0(z)x0 + · · · + an(z)xn = 0o ,

where a0, . . . , an are c-periodic entire functions. Thus H(z) is associated with a
holomorphic mapping

Letting x = [x0 : · · · : xn], we denote

a(z) =(cid:0)a0(z), . . . , an(z)(cid:1) : C → Cn+1.

LH (x, a(z)) = hx, a(z)i = a0(z)x0 + · · · + an(z)xn.

For x = g = [g0 : · · · : gn], we then have

LH(g, a(z)) = hg(z), a(z)i = a0(z)g0(z) + · · · + an(z)gn(z),

and we say that the curve g and the moving hyperplane H is free if LH (g, a(z)) 6≡ 0.

Deﬁnition 3.2. Moving hyperplanes

Hj(z) =([x0 : · · · : xn] :

aji(z)xi = 0)

in Pn over K, and holomorphic mappings aj(z) = (cid:0)aj0(z), . . . , ajn(z)(cid:1) of C into
Cn+1 associated with Hj(z), j = 0, . . . , q, are given. Let eK be a ﬁeld such that
C ⊂ eK. We say that H0(z), . . . , Hq(z) are in general position over eK, if q ≥ n and
any n + 1 of the vectors aj(z), j = 0, . . . , q, are linearly independent over eK.

In order to measure the growth of holomorphic mappings associated with moving
hyperplanes, we need a modiﬁed version of the Cartan characteristic function, and
the corresponding notion of hyper-order.

Deﬁnition 3.3. Let a(z) = (a0(z), . . . , an(z)) : C → Cn+1 be a holomorphic map-

We can now state our generalization of Theorem 3.1.

c ∈ C, let p ∈ {1, . . . , n + 1}. If n + p moving c-periodic hyperplanes Hj in general

We have introduced the holomorphic mapping (3.3) only for the purpose of stat-
ing the relevant growth condition for the coordinate functions aji of a0, . . . , an+p in
a condensed form. Alternatively this assumption could be replaced with a stronger
but simpler condition that each of the coordinate functions aji satisfy ς(aji) < 1.
Note that in either case we do not need every element of aj to be of growth o(Tg(r)),
what is needed here is just that the hyper-order of the holomorphic mapping (3.3)
is strictly less than 1.

Before going into the proof, we demonstrate the sharpness of Theorem 3.4 by

using the following example.

Example 3.5. Since g(z) := π/Γ(1 − z) = (sin πz)Γ(z) is an entire function with
only simple zeros on the set of positive integers, it follows that g−1({0}) = Z>0
is forward invariant under the shift τ (z) = z + 1. On the other hand, the entire
function h(z) := (sin πz)/Γ(z) has simple zeros on Z>0 and double zeros on the
set of non-positive integers Z≤0. Despite of this jump in the multiplicities at the
origin, the set of the zeros of h(z) is still forward invariant with respect to τ (z)
in our deﬁnition. We also note that the gamma function Γ(z) is a meromorphic
function of order 1 and maximal type in the plane, in fact,

T (r, Γ) = (1 + o(1))

r
π

log r

by, e.g., [2, Proposition 7.3.6], while

T (r, sin πz) = 2r + O(1) = o(T (r, Γ)),

see, e.g., [2, p. 27]. Further, sin πz ∈ P 1
Let us consider the holomorphic curve

which has its image in a subset of P2 of dimention 1. Take the four moving hy-
perplanes Hj(z) over P 1
c with c = 1, each of which is given respectively by the
vectors

(cid:0)sin πz, 0, 0(cid:1) , (cid:0)0, sin π(z + 1), 0(cid:1) , (cid:0)0, 0, sin π(z + 1/2)(cid:1) ,

and

(cid:0)sin πz, sin π(z + 1), sin π(z + 1/2)(cid:1)

1 )3 in general position. Now it is easy to see that each of these hyperplanes
in (P 1
has a forward invariant preimage under f . For example, f −1({H1}) coincides with
the zeros of the above entire function h(z). This shows that Theorem 3.4 is sharp
in the case where n = p = 2.

Similarly, when n = 3 and p = 2, 3, the bound [n/p] = 1 is attained by the six

hyperplanes given by following vectors in (P 1

(cos πz)(cid:0)0, 0, 1, 0(cid:1) , (cos πz)(cid:0)0, 0, 0, 1(cid:1) , (cos πz)(cid:0)1, 1, 1, 1(cid:1)

A counter-example is also given to show the best-possibility of the restriction of

hyper-order < 1.

Example 3.6. Consider the holomorphic curve f (z) := [1 : exp e2πiz] : C → P1,
and three two-dimensional constant vectors (1, 0), (0, −1), (1, −1) associating to
three hyperplanes of P1 in general position. It is easy to see that the roots of the
linear equation

h(1, exp e2πiz), (1, −1)i = 1 − exp e2πiz = 0

are forward invariant with respect to τ (z) = z + 1, since they are of the form

In order to prove Theorem 3.4, we need to introduce the following lemma, which
is a generalization of [8, Theorem 3.1]. Since the proof is a simple modiﬁcation of
the proof of [8, Theorem 3.1], we omit the details.

Lemma 3.7. Let c ∈ C, and let g = [g0 : · · · : gn] be a holomorphic curve such that
ς ∗(g) < 1 and such that preimages of all zeros of g0, . . . , gn are forward invariant
with respect to the translation τ (z) = z + c. Let

the linear forms deﬁning the hyperplanes Hj(z) = 0 as in (3.2). Since by assumption
any n + 1 of the hyperplanes Hj, j = 1, . . . , n + p, are linearly independent over P 1
c ,
it follows that any n+2 of the forms LHj (z) satisfy a linear relation with coeﬃcients

Suppose that the complement of Sk has at least n + 1 elements for some k ∈
{1, . . . , N }. Choose an element s0 ∈ Sk, and denote U = {1, . . . , n + p}\Sk ∪ {s0}.
Since the set U contains at least n + 2 elements, there exists a subset U0 ⊂ U such
that U0 ∩ Sk = {s0} and card(U0) = n + 2. Therefore, there exists cj ∈ P 1

for those positive r for which the functions in (3.7) have no zeros on |z| = r.

Suppose that supj∈{1,...,n+2} |hij | has inﬁnitely many zeros on the circle {z :
|z| = r} (where r > 0). Then from Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, there exists a
convergent subsequence zt → z0 as t → ∞ satisfying

sup

|hij (zt)| =

sup

|hij (z0)| = 0.

j∈{1,...,n+2}

j∈{1,...,n+2}

Thus we have |hij (zt)| = |hij (z0)| = 0 (j = 1, . . . , n + 2), i.e., hij (zt) = hij (z0) =
0 (j = 1, . . . , n + 2). Since hij (j = 1, . . . , n + 2) are all entire functions, it follows
from the identity theorem of holomorphic functions, that hij ≡ 0 (j = 1, . . . , n + 2),
a contradiction. Similarly it follows that also supj∈{1,...,n+2} supk∈{0,...,n} |aij k| can
have at most ﬁnitely many zeros on the circle {z : |z| = r}.

If either one of the functions supj∈{1,...,n+2} supk∈{0,...,n} |aij k| and supj∈{1,...,n+2} |hij |

have a ﬁnite number of zeros on the circle {z : |z| = r} (where r > 0), we refer
to [4] for the method of proof on how to deal with this case. Here in convenience
for the readers, we give the details of the proof for (3.8), following [4]. For those r
where there are zeros on the circle of radius r, we modify the path of integration
slightly in order to avoid having zeros on the path. This is done by integrating the
three integrands in (3.8) around a curve γ = γ(r, δ) consisting of arcs of |z| = r and
small “recesses” of suﬃciently small radius δ about each zero of supj∈{1,...,n+2} |hij |
and supj∈{1,...,n+2} supk∈{0,...,n} |aij k| on |z| = r, such that these functions have no
zeros on the new path of integration for any δ > 0. In this case, (3.8) holds when
the path of integration is replaced by γ. Letting δ → 0, it follows that on each
small recess the integrands on both sides of the inequality (3.8) are of the form
O(− log δ), and the length of the recess is of the form O(δ). This implies that the
corresponding integrals around each recess tend to zero as δ → 0. Since the curve
γ approaches the circle |z| = r as δ → 0, it follows that (3.8) holds on |z| = r.

We have shown that (3.8) holds for all positive r. We set

14

and we can hence apply Lemma 3.7.

By using Lemma 3.7, from (3.5) we get that

cs0 hs0 ≡ 0,

which is a contradiction. So we have that the set {1, . . . , n + p}\Sk has at most n
elements. Hence Sk has at least p elements for all k = 1, . . . , N , and it follows that
N ≤ (n + p)/p.

Let V be any subset of {1, . . . , n + p} with exactly n + 1 elements. Then the
forms LHj , j ∈ V , are linearly independent. By denoting Vk = V ∩ Sk it follows
that

4. Difference analogues of truncated second main theorem

In this section we introduce two alternative diﬀerence analogues of the truncated
second main theorem, and give corresponding diﬀerence deﬁciency relations. We
start with a deﬁnition of the diﬀerence counterpart of the concept of truncation.

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let n ∈ N, c ∈ C\{0} and a ∈ P. An a-point z0 of a meromorphic
function h(z) is said to be n-successive and c-separated, if the n entire functions
h(z +νc) (ν = 1, . . . , n) take the value a at z = z0 with multiplicity not less than that
of h(z) there. All the other a-points of h(z) are called n-aperiodic of pace c. By
˜N [n,c]
(r, LH) we denote the counting function of n-aperiodic zeros of the function
LH(g, a) = hg(z), a(z)i of pace c.

g

Note that ˜N [n,c]

g

(r, LH ) ≡ 0 when all the zeros of LH(g, a) with taking their
multiplicities into account are located periodically with period c. This is also the
case when the hyperplane H is forward invariant by g with respect to the translation

τc(z) = z + c, i.e. τc(cid:0)g−1({H})(cid:1) ⊂ g−1({H}) holds. In fact, it follows by deﬁnition

that any zero with a forward invariant preimage of the function LH(g, a) must be
n-successive and c-separated, since

In addition, we denote

g−1({H}) ⊂ τ−c(cid:0)g−1({H})(cid:1) ⊂ τ−(n−1)c(cid:0)g−1({H})(cid:1).
Ng(r, LH ) = N(cid:18)r,

We give the following short notation to be used through the remainder of this

paper. Let g(z) be a meromorphic function, and let c ∈ C, we set

g(z) ≡ g, g(z + c) ≡ g, g(z + 2c) ≡ g and g(z + nc) ≡ g[n]

to suppress the z-dependence of g(z). The Casorati determinant of g0, . . . , gn is
then deﬁned by

With these deﬁnitions in hand we can show the following auxiliary result.

Lemma 4.2. Let g be a holomorphic curve of C into Pn(C), let n ∈ N and q ∈ N
be such that q ≥ n, and let

aj (z) = (aj0, . . . , ajn),

j ∈ {0, . . . , q},

where ajk(z) are c-periodic entire functions satisfying T (r, ajk) = o(Tg(r)) for all
j, k ∈ {0, . . . , q}. If the moving hyperplanes

(4.1)

(4.2)

are located in general position, then

Hj(z) =(cid:8)[x0 : · · · : xn] : LHj (x, aj (z)) = 0(cid:9) ,

qXj=0

˜N [n,c]

g

(r, LHj ) + o(Tg(r)).

j ∈ {0, . . . , q},

Proof. By Theorem 2.1 the counting function N ∗(r) for those points where more
than n functions LHj vanish simultaneously is of the growth

(4.3)

N ∗(r) = o(Tg(r)).

The contribution to (4.2) from such points can therefore be incorporated in the
error term.

Suppose now that z0 is an n-successive c-separated zero of LHj for some j ∈
{0, . . . , q}. By (4.3), and Theorem 2.1, we may assume that there are at most
n indexes within {0, . . . , q} such that LHj (z0) = 0. Therefore, by reordering the
indexes if necessary we may assume that LHj (z0) 6= 0 for all j ∈ {n, . . . , q}, and
thus there is no contribution to the counting functions Ng(r, LHn ), . . . , Ng(r, LHq )
from the point z0.

Now, there are integers mj(≥ 0) and holomorphic functions hjk(z) in a neigh-

borhood U of z0 such that

(4.4) LHj (z + kc) = hg(z + kc), aj(z + kc)i = (z − z0)mj hjk(z)

for 0 ≤ j, k ≤ n.

Here, for convenience, we set mj = 0 whenever hg(z0), aj(z0)i 6= 0. Since

LHj (z) = hg(z), aj(z)i =

ajk(z)gk(z),

Since the hyperplanes (4.1) are in general position, we may invert A and obtain

where T (r, det(A−1)) = o(Tg(r)). The cases where z0 is a zero of det(A−1) can
therefore be incorporated in the error term o(Tg(r)). Hence, assuming that det(A−1)
is non-zero at z0, we have by (4.4),

C(cid:0)g0, . . . , gn(cid:1) =

Instead of n-successive points, we can consider points with diﬀerent separation
properties. For instance, we say that a is a derivative-like paired value of f with
the separation c if the following property holds for all except at most ﬁnitely many
a-points of f : whenever f (z) = a with the multiplicity m, then also f (z + c) = a
with the multiplicity max{m − 1, 0}.

Before introducing Theorem 4.6, we give the following deﬁnition of the usual

truncated counting function ﬁrst, please refer, for instance, to [4] for details.

Deﬁnition 4.5. For a meromorphic function f satisfying f 6≡ 0 and a positive
integer j, let nj(r, 0, f ) denote the number of zeros of f in {z : |z| ≤ r}, counted in
the following manner: a zero of f of multiplicity m is counted exactly k times where
k = min{m, j}. Then let Nj(r, 0, f ) denote the corresponding integrated counting
function; that is,

Nj(r, 0, f ) = nj(0, 0, f ) log r +Z r

0

nj(t, 0, f ) − nj(0, 0, f )

t

dt.

With this deﬁnition we may state the second diﬀerence analogue of the truncated

second main theorem.

Theorem 4.6. Assume that the hypotheses of Theorem 1.2 hold, and 0 is a derivative-
like paired value of fi with the separation c for all i ∈ {0, . . . , q}. Then we have

N (r, 0, L) ≤

qXj=0

Nn(r, 0, fj) + O(1),

and this gives

(q − n)Tg(r) ≤

qXj=0

Nn(r, 0, fj) − N (r, L) + o(Tg(r)),

where r approaches inﬁnity outside of an exceptional set of ﬁnite logarithmic mea-
sure.

For the proof of Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 4.6, the following lemma is needed.

Lemma 4.7 ([8]). If the holomorphic curve g = [g0 : · · · : gn] satisﬁes ς(g) < 1
and if c ∈ C, then C(g0, . . . , gn) ≡ 0 if and only if the entire functions g0, . . . , gn
are linearly dependent over the ﬁeld P 1
c .

Proof of Theorem 4.6. Suppose that a0, . . . , aq−n−1 are any q − n distinct integers
in the set {0, 1, . . . , q}, and let b0, b1, . . . , bn denote the remaining integers in the
set {0, 1, . . . , q}.

DIFFERENCE ANALOGUE OF CARTAN SECOND MAIN THEOREM

21

From (1.2), (4.12) and (4.13), we have

(4.14)

L =

f0f1 · · · fq

Ab0b1···bn (z)C(fb0 , fb1 , . . . , fbn )

=

fa0fa1 · · · faq−n−1

Ab0b1···bn (z)H

,

where

(4.15)

and Ab0b1···bn (z) is a meromorphic function satisfying T (r, Ab0b1···bn (z)) = o(Tg(r)).
We set A as in (2.11) in the proof of Theorem 2.1. Let z0 ∈ C\A be a zero of L
of multiplicity µ. Then from (1.2), at least one of the functions f0, f1, . . . , fq has
a zero at z0. For each z0 ∈ C\A, from Theorem 2.1 we can choose the integers
a0, a1, . . . , aq−n−1 to be a particular set of integers 0, 1, . . . , q satisfying

(4.16)

fa0(z0)fa1 (z0) · · · faq−n−1(z0) 6= 0,

and we use these integers in (4.14). From (4.13), (4.8) and (4.6), we have Ab0···bn (z0) 6=
∞. Thus combining (4.14), (4.15) with the above analysis, we get that z0 is a pole
of H with the multiplicity at least µ. From inspection of the form of H in (4.15),
we deduce that the poles of H arise from the zeros of fbi (i = 0, . . . , n). For each
j = 0, . . . , n, z0 is a zero of fbj of multiplicity mbj , where mbj ≥ 0. Since 0 is
the derivative-like paired value of fi with the separation c, we have that whenever
fbj (z+ic)
fbj (z) = ∞ with the multiplic-
fbj (z) = 0 with the multiplicity mbj , we get that
ity mbj − max{mbj − i, 0} = min{i, mbj } except for at most ﬁnitely many zeros of
fbj . Hence

µ ≤

nXj=0

min{mbj , n}

except at most ﬁnitely many zeros of fb0, . . . , fbn . Thus the conclusions hold. (cid:3)

Theorem 4.6 immediately implies the following deﬁciency relation for derivative-

like paired values of holomorphic curves.

Corollary 4.8. Under the assumption of Theorem 4.6, we have

where

δ[n]
g (0, fj) ≤ n + 1,

qXj=0

δ[n]
g (0, fj) = 1 − lim sup
r→∞

Nn(cid:16)r, 1
fj(cid:17)

Tg(r)

.

Theorem 1.2 can also be used to obtain a suﬃcient condition, in terms of value
distribution, for the growth of a holomorphic curve to be relatively fast. For this,
we ﬁrst need the following deﬁnition from [6].

22

R. KORHONEN, N. LI, AND K. TOHGE

Deﬁnition 4.9 ([6]). We say that a is an exceptional paired value of f with the
separation c if the following property holds for all except at most ﬁnitely many a-
points of f : Whenever f (z) = a then also f (z + c) = a with the same or higher
multiplicity.

Corollary 4.10. Let n ≥ 1, and let g = [g0 : . . . : gn] be a holomorphic curve of C
into Pn(C), where g0, . . . , gn are linearly independent over P 1

c . If

fj =

aijgi

j = 0, . . . , q, q > n,

nXi=0

where aij are c-periodic entire functions satisfying T (r, aij) = o(Tg(r)), such that
any n + 1 of the q + 1 functions f0, . . . , fq are linearly independent over P 1
c and 0
is an exceptional paired value of fi for all i ∈ {0, . . . , q}, then we have ς(g) ≥ 1.

Proof of Corollary 4.10. Suppose that ς(g) < 1. Then from Theorem 1.2, we have
that

(4.17)

(q − n)Tg(r) ≤ N(cid:18)r,

1

L(cid:19) − N (r, L) + o(Tg(r)),

where r approaches inﬁnity outside of an exceptional set E of ﬁnite logarithmic
measure.

But combining (4.15) with the assumption that 0 is exceptional paired value of
fi, we deduce that H(z) does not have poles. Thus L(z) does not have zeros on
z ∈ C \ A, where A ⊂ E is deﬁned as in the proof of Theorem 2.1. So we get a
contradiction from (4.17), and thus we have ς(g) ≥ 1.
(cid:3)

5. Proof of Theorem 1.2

In order to prove Theorem 1.2, we introduce some lemmas ﬁrstly. The following

lemma is about the growth of non-decreasing real-valued functions.

Lemma 5.1 ([8]). Let T : [0, +∞) → [0, +∞) be a non-decreasing continuous
function and let s ∈ (0, ∞). If the hyper-order of T is strictly less than one, i.e.,

lim sup

r→∞

log log T (r)

log r

= ς < 1

and δ ∈ (0, 1 − ς) then

rδ (cid:19)
T (r + s) = T (r) + o(cid:18) T (r)

where r runs to inﬁnity outside of a set of ﬁnite logarithmic measure.

The following lemma is an extension of the analogue of the lemma on the loga-
rithmic derivative for ﬁnite-order meromorphic functions ([5, Lemma 2.3], [6, The-
orem 2.1]) to the case of functions with the hyper-order less than one.

Lemma 5.2 ([8]). Let f (z) be a non-constant meromorphic function and c ∈ C. If
ς(f ) = ς < 1 and ε > 0, then

m(cid:18)r,

f (z + c)

f (z) (cid:19) = o(cid:18) T (r, f )
r1−ς−ε(cid:19)

for all r outside of a set of ﬁnite logarithmic measure.

DIFFERENCE ANALOGUE OF CARTAN SECOND MAIN THEOREM

23

The following lemma shows that Cartan and Nevanlinna characteristic functions

are essentially the same in the one-dimensional case.

Lemma 5.3 ([4]). Let h1 and h2 be two linearly independent entire functions that
have no common zeros, and set f = h1/h2. For positive r, set

1

2πZ 2π

0

Tf (r) =

Then

u(reiθ)dθ − u(0), where u(z) = sup{log |h1(z)|, log |h2(z)|}.

Tf (r) = T (r, f ) + O(1) as

r → ∞.

For two meromorphic functions f and g (where f 6≡ 0 and g 6≡ 0), let N (r, 0; f, g)
denote the counting function of the common zeros of f and g, counted in the
following manner.
If z0 is a zero of f with multiplicity m and a zero of g with
multiplicity n, then N (r, 0; f, g) counts z0 exactly k times, where k = min{m, n}.
The following lemma is a generalization of [4, Lemma 8.1]. The diﬀerence is that
in the original version, fj are linear combinations of the functions g0, . . . , gn with
constant coeﬃcients, while in the following version, we generalize the coeﬃcients
into small meromorphic functions.

Lemma 5.4. Let g = [g0 : · · · : gn] with n ≥ 1 be a reduced representation of a
non-constant holomorphic curve g. If

fj =

nXi=0

aijgi

j = 0, . . . , q, q > n,

where aij are entire functions satisfying T (r, aij) = o(Tg(r)), such that any n + 1
of the q + 1 functions f0, . . . , fq are linearly independent over P 1

c , then we have

T (r, gj/gm) + N (r, 0; gj, gm) ≤ (1 + o(1))Tg(r),

as

r → ∞,

and for any µ and ν, we have

T (r, fµ/fν) + N (r, 0; fµ, fν) ≤ (1 + o(1))Tg(r),

as

r → ∞,

where µ and ν are distinct integers in the set {0, . . . , q}.

Proof. The proof of the ﬁrst inequality is the same as the proof of the corresponding
inequality in [4, Lemma 8.1]. Next we prove the second inequality. Parts of the
proof are based on modiﬁcations of the ideas behind the proof of [4, Lemma 8.1].
Suppose that fµ and fν are any two distinct functions of the functions f0, f1, . . . , fq.
Since

(5.4)

T (r, fµ/fν) = T (r, hµ/hν) =

t(reiθ)dθ + O(1) as

If sup{|fµ(z)|, |fν(z)|} or |ωµν (z)| have zeros on the circle {z : |z| = r} (where
r > 0), then following a similar argument as in the proof of Theorem 3.4, we will
obtain that (5.5) holds on |z| = r. Hence (5.5) holds for all positive r.

ωµν(cid:19) − N(cid:18)r,

ωµν(cid:19)(cid:19)

Since Tg(r) → ∞ as r → ∞, we have that O(1) = o(Tg(r)), and so from (5.7) and
(5.8), we have

T (r, fµ/fν) ≤ (1 + o(1))Tg(r) − N (r, 0, ωµν)

= (1 + o(1))Tg(r) − N (r, 0; fµ, fν) as

r → ∞.

Thus the conclusion holds.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. By Theorem 2.1, the auxiliary function

(5.9)

h(z) =

max

{kj }q−n−1

j=0 ⊂{0,...,q}

log |fk0(z) · · · fkq−n−1(z)|

gives a ﬁnite real number for all z ∈ C \ A, where the set A is of ﬁnite logarithmic
measure as deﬁned in Theorem 2.1. We let {a0, . . . , aq−n−1} ⊂ {0, . . . , q}, and

{b0, . . . , bn} = {0, . . . , q} \ {a0, . . . , aq−n−1}.

Then we have (4.5) and (4.6). By using the same method as in the proof of Theo-
rem 4.6, we have (4.12) and (4.13).

Next, we set the auxiliary function

eL :=

Following the reference [8], we now prove

N(cid:18)r,

eL(cid:19) − N (r,eL) ≤ N(cid:18)r,

L(cid:19) − N (r, L) + o(Tg(r)).

eL is meromorphic, there is a possibility of skipping this step by adding another

where r approaches inﬁnity outside of the exceptional set EA ∪ E0 ∪ E1. Since EA,
E0 and E1 are all of ﬁnite logarithmic measure, their union EA ∪ E0 ∪ E1 is as well.
The assertion therefore follows by substituting inequality (5.11) into (5.21).
