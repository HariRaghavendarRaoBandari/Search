Electrons diﬀraction scattering on a traveling wave – ”Inelastic Kapitza-Dirac eﬀect”

Centre of Strong Fields Physics, Yerevan State University, 1 A. Manukian, Yerevan 0025, Armenia

(Dated: March 2, 2016)

In this paper conceptual points regarding electrons elastic (Kapitza-Dirac eﬀect) and inelastic
diﬀraction eﬀect on the diﬀerent type slowed electromagnetic wave structures/light gratings are
considered. From the uniﬁed point of view it is analyzed the main works on this subject for last four
decades in chronological order, pointing out the essential peculiarity inherent in induced Cherenkov,
Compton, and undulator/wiggler processes too. This review article has also a goal to resolve
confusion in scientiﬁc literature connected with the recently appeared paper [6] relating the electrons
diﬀraction on a traveling wave in a dielectric medium.

In recent years, especially after the realization of ex-
periment on strongly coherent and intense laser beams
[1], the interest to Kapitza–Dirac eﬀect [2] has been in-
creased. This, in particular, is conditioned by the signif-
icant role of observed electrons diﬀraction eﬀect on high-
intensity laser beams-gratings [3], [1], since the diﬀracted
from highly coherent laser gratings electron beams are
coherent with each other, and Kapitza–Dirac eﬀect is a
very convenient, perhaps the best means to realize co-
herent electron beams (see, also, the review paper [4]).
This is important fact that can serve as a basis for con-
struction of diverse type new tools, e.g., coherent beam
splitters, new type electron interferometers which would
operate at rather low electron energies etc. Furthermore,
since 1975 the scope of the Kapitza–Dirac eﬀect, which
is valid for the electrons elastic scattering on a standing
light wave/grating, has been extended [7], [8], [9] for in-
elastic diﬀraction scattering of electrons on a slowed trav-
elling wave propagating with the phase velocity vph < c
(c is the light speed in vacuum), to consideration of gen-
eral aspects of which is devoted the present review arti-
cle. The motivation of the latter have two reasons. First
-that is the most important, is connected with the es-
sential peculiarity inherent in mentioned processes (in-
duced Cherenkov, Compton, and undulator/wiggler) [7],
[8], [9] -existence of a critical ﬁeld, above which a nonlin-
ear threshold phenomenon arises radically changing the
dynamics of electron-slowed travelling wave interaction,
and consequently, the situation for inelastic diﬀraction
scattering. Second, electrons diﬀraction eﬀect on a trav-
elling wave in a dielectric medium requires a special con-
sideration because of a confusion in scientiﬁc literature
connected with the appearance recently of a paper on
this subject [6]. Therefore, apart from the pure scien-
tiﬁc interest, the current review has a goal to clear up
the-state-of-the-art in the considering ﬁeld for last four
decades in chronological order, to avoid the further con-
fusion and misunderstandings in scientiﬁc literature.

The predicted by Kapitza and Dirac in 1933 phe-
nomenon of electrons diﬀraction scattering on a phase
lattice of a standing light wave naturally for that time
had an one-photon character because of the absence of
strong and coherent radiation ﬁelds. The experimental
situation has been reviewed by H. Schwarz in [26, 27] (see,
also [25]). With the appearance of laser sources Kapitza-

Dirac diﬀraction eﬀect achieved multiphoton character,
the probability of which in the ﬁeld of strong counter-
propagating laser beams has been done by F. Ehlotzky
and C. Leubner in 1974 on the base of the Helmholtz–
Kirchhoﬀ diﬀraction theory [17, 18] (see, also [24] where a
theoretical analysis is made of the scattering of electrons
by a strong standing wave with a slowly varying ampli-
tude). This is an elastic scattering of electrons moving in
perpendicular direction to wavevectors of counterprop-
agating waves (k and −k) of the same frequencies -to
except the Doppler shifting because of longitudinal com-
ponent of electrons’ velocity, and a stationary periodic
space-conﬁguration (standing wave structure) is formed
providing the phase matching between the electrons and
counterpropagating waves, only at which the coherent
scattering – electrons diﬀraction on a standing light-wave
takes place.

Then, in 1975 this phenomenon has been developed by
V.M. Haroutunian and H.K. Avetissian for bichromatic
counterpropagating waves and electrons inelastic diﬀrac-
tion scattering on a slowed interference wave has been
stated [7]. In this process, due to the induced Compton
eﬀect in the two wave ﬁelds an electron absorbs s photons
from the one wave (of frequency ω1) and coherently radi-
ates s photons into the other wave (of frequency ω2) and
vice versa. This is the condition of coherency in the in-
duced Compton process corresponding to the resonance
between the Doppler-shifted frequencies in the intrinsic
frame of reference of an electron in the bichromatic coun-
terpropagating waves:

ω1(cid:16)1 −

vx

c (cid:17) = ω2(cid:16)1 +

vx

c (cid:17)

(1)

(vx is the electron longitudinal velocity with respect to
counterpropagating waves), at which the conservation of
the number of photons in the induced Compton process
takes place, in contrast to spontaneous Compton eﬀect in
the strong wave ﬁeld where after the multiphoton absorp-
tion a single photon is emitted. The result of such coher-
ent scattering is equivalent to diﬀraction of electrons on a
slowed interference wave in the form of a plane traveling
wave:

E1E2 cos(cid:20)(ω1 − ω2)(cid:18)t −

ω1 + ω2
|ω1 − ω2|

x

c(cid:19)(cid:21)

(2)

(E1,2 are the amplitudes of the waves’ electric ﬁeld
strengths). So, because of nonstationary ﬁeld Eq. (2) the
energy of an electron does not conserved (in other words,
the energies of absorbed and emitted photons are dif-
ferent) and in contradistinction to Kapitza–Dirac eﬀect
on a standing phase lattice here the scattering process is
inelastic. The energy change ∆E after the interaction is:

∆E = s (ω1 − ω2) , ∆px = s (ω1 + ω2) /c,

∆py = 0; s = 0,±1, . . . .

(3)

(the waves, linearly polarized along the axis y, are prop-
agating in the direction x along which electron acquires
momentum transfer ∆px in the interaction process; coor-
dinate z is cyclic, hence: ∆pz ≡ 0) which determines the
maximums and minimums of diﬀraction peaks over the
energy in the probability distribution of inelastic diﬀrac-
tion of electrons. For the latter, in accordance with Eq.
(1), we shall direct the electron velocity v at the angle
ϑc to the axis x under the condition:
v cos ϑc = c|ω1 − ω2|
ω1 + ω2

(4)

of coherency between two waves. At the condition Eq.
(4) the traveling interference wave Eq.
(2) in the in-
trinsic frame of reference moving with the electron (of
velocity equal to phase velocity of the slowed wave vph =
c|ω1 − ω2| /(ω1 + ω2) < c), the travelling wave becomes a
standing phase lattice/light grating, and elastic diﬀrac-
tion scattering – Kapitza–Dirac eﬀect occurs. It is ob-
vious that in the laboratory frame of reference this is
inelastic diﬀraction scattering.

However, the described picture of inelastic diﬀraction
on the slowed traveling interference wave is only the kine-
matics of the electrons’ coherent scattering in the induced
Compton process with bichromatic counterpropagating
waves. What concerns the dynamics of this interaction,
as has been shown in the works [10], [11], and [15], the
induced coherent processes such Cherenkov, Compton,
and undulator/wiggler ones are possessed with basic pe-
culiarity which radically changes the ordinary interac-
tion dynamics of an electron with the periodic wave-ﬁeld,
and above a certain value of the wave intensity a non-
linear threshold phenomenon of electrons ”reﬂection” or
capture by a slowed traveling wave occurs. Hence, we
must take into account this fact and only after the estab-
lishment of necessary dynamic condition for synchronous
motion of an electron with the slowed wave one can speak
about the inelastic diﬀraction eﬀect on a traveling wave.
The exact investigation of the dynamics of induced
Compton process reveals the existence of a critical ﬁeld
in this process

ξcr(ω1, ω2) ≡ (ξ1 + ξ2)cr =
c(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)
c(cid:1) − ω2(cid:0)1 + v
2√ω1ω2

mc2(cid:12)(cid:12)ω1(cid:0)1 − v

E0

2

(ξ1,2 ≡ eE1,2/mcω1,2 are the dimensionless relativistic in-
variant parameters of the waves’ intensities, where e, m
are the charge and mass of the electron). Thus, if the in-
tensity of a slowed interference wave Eq. (2) exceeds this
critical value Eq. (5): ξ1 + ξ2 > ξcr(ω1, ω2), a nonlinear
threshold phenomenon of particle ”reﬂection” or capture
by the slowed traveling wave occurs [11], at which the
periodic wave-ﬁeld in the intrinsic frame of reference of
the slowed interference wave becomes a potential barrier
for a particle, instead of a standing phase lattice, and
reﬂecting from this barrier electron abandons the wave.
Therefore, the considering eﬀect of electrons diﬀraction
on a travelling wave propagating with the phase veloc-
ity vph < c can occur only if the total intensity of the
waves is smaller than the critical value of correspond-
ing induced process; in case of Compton one –Eq. (5):
ξ1 + ξ2 < ξcr(ω1, ω2).

It is necessary to note that the expression of Eq. (5) for
critical ﬁeld of induced Compton process corresponds to a
case ϑc = 0 when it has a simple form and exact analytic
solution of this issue is succeeded. For inelastic diﬀrac-
tion eﬀect that takes place at the angle ϑc satisfying to
condition Eq. (4) of the induced Compton resonance, the
formula of critical ﬁeld has a relatively complex form and
therefore it is not convenient to present here bulk expres-
sions. The reader interested in more detailed information
regarding the general cases of electrons ”reﬂection” or
capture by a slowed traveling wave at the arbitrary angle
ϑ can ﬁnd the corresponding expressions for critical ﬁeld
in the papers [14], [13], and [16], or more details in the
work [12].

Electrons inelastic diﬀraction eﬀect directly on a trav-
elling wave has been developed in 1976 by H.K. Avetis-
sian [8], proposing to use a dielectric medium for de-
creasing of the wave phase velocity -making it smaller
c. It is clear that electron-travelling wave interaction at
vph < c in a dielectric medium corresponds to induced
Cherenkov process [8]. Thus, by the same physical con-
sideration mentioned above, in [8] has been shown that
if one direct the electron velocity v at the angle ϑch to
the wave propagation direction

v cos ϑch =

c
n

,

(6)

where n is the refractive index of a dielectric medium,
under this condition the travelling wave in the intrin-
sic frame of reference becomes a standing phase lattice
on which diﬀraction scattering of electrons occurs. We
will not repeat here the further consideration of inelastic
diﬀraction eﬀect in a dielectric medium, which has been
done in many publications:
[8], monographs [21], [23],
and book [22]. Only let us to state here the restriction
by the wave intensity eﬀect for inelastic diﬀraction, repre-
senting the formula for critical ﬁeld of induced Cherenkov
process:

(5)

ξcr(ϑ) =

c
2v

mc2(cid:0)1 − n v
E

c cos ϑ(cid:1)2
(n2 − 1)| sin ϑ|

;

ϑ 6= 0

(7)

(E is the electron initial energy) that conﬁnes the wave
intensity for diﬀraction eﬀect in a dielectric medium be-
cause of the nonlinear threshold phenomenon of particle
”reﬂection” or capture by a traveling wave in a dielectric
medium [10]. Consequently, for ”Cherenkov diﬀraction”
eﬀect the wave intensity ξ in a dielectric medium should
be less than the critical value Eq. (7): ξ < ξcr(ϑ).

The third case of electrons inelastic diﬀraction scatter-
ing on a slowed traveling wave, developed by the H.K.
Avetissian et al. in 1981 [9] again for vacuum case, is the
propagation of a plane monochromatic wave through an
electric and magnetic undulator/wiggler. In such space
– time periodic structures, like to the considered above
induced Compton process, a slowed interference wave is
formed, on which diﬀraction scattering of electrons oc-
curs by the described scheme, at the intensities below the
corresponding critical values of nonlinear threshold phe-
nomenon of electrons ”reﬂection” or capture by a trav-
elling wave in the electric and magnetic undulators (see
[15]). As far as descriptions of electrons’ inelastic diﬀrac-
tion scattering on a plane monochromatic wave in the
electric and magnetic undulators are coincide in many
features, here we will consider the more important case of
magnetic undulator/wiggler, which is currently the most
perspective coherent tool with extremely large length of
coherency, speciﬁcally due to which the x-ray free elec-
tron laser has been realized in the wiggler.

is formed propagating with the phase velocity vph =
c/(1 + λ
l ) < c, where λ = 2πc/ω is the wavelength of
monochromatic wave (the geometry is the same as in
case of counterpropagating waves). Hence, if we direct
the electron velocity v at the angle ϑu to the undulator
axis (wave propagation direction):

v cos ϑu =

1 + λ

,

(11)

the slowed interference wave Eq.
(10) in the intrinsic
frame of reference will become a standing phase lattice
on which inelastic diﬀraction scattering of electrons will

occur. In accordance with the aforementioned dynamic
statements for coherent processes, the inelastic diﬀrac-
tion will take place at the intensities of the total ﬁeld
ξ + ξH below the corresponding critical intensity of this
process: ξ + ξH < ξcr (λ/l) [15]

(12)

Let us to note that Eq. (12) corresponds again to a case
ϑu = 0 for exact nonlinear solution, as was justiﬁed above
for bichromatic counterpropagating waves.

It is important to note that the mentioned phe-
nomenon of particle ”reﬂection” in the induced coher-
ent processes [10], [11], and [15] takes place even in the
very weak wave-ﬁelds if the electrons initially are close
to the resonance state, i.e. the electrons’ initial longi-
tudinal velocity vx is close to the phase velocity vph of
the slowed wave at which the critical ﬁeld is very small
too and the condition of ξ < ξcr(ϑ) may be violated [28],
[12]. So, no matter how the traveling electromagnetic
(EM) wave is weak, the described inelastic diﬀraction
eﬀect even on such a weak wave may not occur if the
condition ξ < ξcr(ϑ) is not satisﬁed.

The considered eﬀect of inelastic diﬀraction on a trav-
eling wave in all three induced coherent processes has
been described in the scope of relativistic quantum the-
ory with the help of eikonal wave function – the solution
of the Klein-Gordon equation for description of multipho-
ton processes at the electron-wave nonlinear interaction.
As far as the method of solution of quantum equation of
motion in eikonal approximation is general for described
coherent processes, here we will represent only the dy-
namic results for inelastic diﬀraction in case of a travel-
ing EM wave in a dielectric medium in the original form
corresponding to the paper [8] and monographs [21], [23]
or the book [22] for comparison its with the result of the
paper [6] of 2015 pretended to priority for proposed eﬀect
of electrons diﬀraction on a traveling wave in a dielectric
medium.

Thus, neglecting the spin interaction in the quadratic
form of Dirac equation for an electron (as is known, at
ﬁrst, the spin interaction of an electron with a light-ﬁeld
is rather small compared with the charge interaction and,
second, by it’s nature is diﬀerent than considering ef-
fect; regarding spin dynamics in the Kapitza-Dirac eﬀect,
see the paper [5]), the latter passes to the Klein-Gordon
equation for electron in the ﬁeld of a plane EM wave in
a dielectric medium:

coordinates τ ′ = t − x/v cos ϑ and η′ = t, it will be ob-
vious that at the fulﬁllment of the induced Cherenkov
condition v cos ϑch = c/n Eq. (6) the traveling wave in
this frame of coordinates becomes a diﬀraction lattice
over the coordinate τ ′ and for the scattered amplitude of

(24)

From Eq. (24) it follows that at the inelastic diﬀraction
there is an asymmetry in the angular distribution of the
scattered particle: |ϑ−s| > ϑs, i.e., the main diﬀraction
maximums are situated at diﬀerent angles with respect
to the direction of particle initial motion. However, in ac-
cordance with the condition |s| nω/c << p of the eikonal
approximation this asymmetry is negligibly small and for
the scattering angles of the main diﬀraction maximums
from Eq. (24) we have ϑ−s ≃ −ϑs. Hence, the main
diﬀraction maximums will be situated at the angles

ϑ±s = ±s

with respect to the direction of the particle initial motion.

Note that in 1977 the formula Eq. (22) has been ap-
plied by the author for explanation of the experiment
on energetic widening of an electron beam at the in-
duced Cherenkov process in a gaseous medium [19], im-
plemented in SLAC by R. Pantell and his group [20] (see,
also the cited next experiment of this group in 1981, made
in the same conditions).

These results, in particular, inelastic Kapitza–Dirac
eﬀect and diﬀraction on a traveling wave in a dielec-
tric medium, as was mentioned above, had been received
forty years ago and included in the monographs [21] and
[23], as well as in the book [22]. Nevertheless, after the
four decades, in 2015 by the same title has been pub-
lished a paper in New Journal of Physics, v. 17, 082002,
2015 by the authors Armen G Hayrapetyan, Karen K
Grigoryan, J¨org B G¨otte and Rubik G Petrosyan [6],
who report in the Abstract on the possibility of electrons
diﬀraction scattering on a travelling EM wave in a dielec-
tric medium: ”We report on the possibility of diﬀracting
electrons from light waves travelling inside a dielectric
medium. We show that, in the frame of reference which
moves with the group velocity of light, the travelling wave
acts as a stationary diﬀraction grating from which elec-
trons can diﬀract, similar to the conventional Kapitza–
Dirac eﬀect” (citation from the Abstract). Here only the
diﬀerence with the known results is in the physical char-
acteristic ”group velocity of light” which is a rough mis-
take repeated also in the text, even for a monochromatic
wave. As it has been shown above, diﬀraction eﬀect is
thoroughly the result of the phase relations and is con-
ditioned exceptionally by the phase velocity of light that
must be smaller than c. Beside this incorrectness, au-
thors of this paper [6] ignored the existence of critical ﬁeld
in this process and inﬂuence of considered phenomenon
of a particle ”reﬂection” or capture on the diﬀraction ef-
fect, meanwhile one of these authors is also a co-author of
both inelastic diﬀraction eﬀect [9] and ”reﬂection” phe-
nomenon in the undulators [15]. Concerning the citation
of considering papers devoted to diﬀraction eﬀect on a
travelling wave, these mechanically are included in the
list of References of the paper [6] in irrelevant context by
footnote: ”see, for example...”.

Concerning the method of calculation of the prob-
ability of multiphoton diﬀraction scattering, it is well
known that there are two adequate methods - quantum
mechanical and Helmholtz–Kirchhoﬀ diﬀraction theory.
The second method has been proposed and applied by F.
Ehlotzky and C. Leubner in 1974 just for the calculation
of the multiphoton diﬀraction probability of ”Kapitza–
Dirac eﬀect” in strong laser ﬁelds [17]. Following to
this calculation method, authors of the paper [6] obtain
the known formula for the probability of multiphoton
diﬀraction scattering in a dielectric medium Eq. (22) and
claim on the possibility of diﬀraction eﬀect in a dielectric
medium.

Thus, the probability of s-photon diﬀraction in the pa-

per [6] is given by the formula 16:

Is = IiJ 2

s (∆) ; ∆ =

eA0d

c

.

5

(26)

The analogous expression for s-photon diﬀraction in the
paper [8] is given by the formula 8 (which is the obtained
above Eq. (22)):

Ws = J 2

s (cid:18) ec2E0tP sin ϑch

ωE

(cid:19) = J 2

s (cid:18) eE0d
ω (cid:19) ,

(27)

where d ≡ tv sin ϑch is the electron-wave interaction
length.
Expressing the amplitude of the wave electric ﬁeld
strength E0 by the amplitude A0 of the wave vector po-
tential (E0 = A0ω/c), Eq. (27) will have a form:

Ws = J 2

s (∆) ; ∆ =

eA0d

c

.

(28)

i.e., the formula (26) is the same as formula (27) or (28)
except of undetermined normalization constant Ii, which
should be Ii = 1 in accordance to the total probability
norm of the process, and general formula for the Bessel
functions:

∞

Xs=−∞

J 2
s (∆) = 1.

(29)

(s < 0 -corresponds to photon radiation, s > 0 -to photon
absorption in the wave ﬁeld).

Note that considered eﬀect of electrons inelastic
diﬀraction takes place at the fulﬁlment of classical res-
onance condition Eq. (6). The latter is valid if the quan-
tum recoil of an electron because of photons absorption-
radiation processes can be neglected. Mathematically
the quantum recoil is connected with the second order
derivatives of the wave function which are neglected in
the eikonal approximation (see Eq. (15)). For the diﬀrac-
tion eﬀect with suﬃciently long interaction time and
large energy-momentum exchange one should take into
account quantum recoil. At that, instead of the classical
Cherenkov condition Eq. (6) we will have the quantum
Cherenkov condition with the quantum recoil [21]:

1 − n

v
c

cos ϑ =

sω(n2 − 1)

2E

.

(30)

The condition (30) has transparent physical interpreta-
tion in the intrinsic frame of reference of the slowed wave.
In this frame, due to the conservation of particle energy
and transverse momentum the real transitions in this -
strongly quantum regime- occur from a p′
x state to the
−p′
x one and we reach the Bragg diﬀraction eﬀect on a
slowed traveling wave in a dielectric medium at the ful-
ﬁlment of the condition:

2p′

x = sk′

(s = ±1,±2...).

(31)

The latter expresses the condition of exact resonance be-
tween the particle de Broglie wave and the “wave motion-
less lattice”. In particular, in this case when the above
mentioned particle capture regime by the slowed travel-
ing wave [10] takes place, we have the quantum eﬀect of
zone structure of particle states like the particle states in

a crystal lattice, and the diﬀraction maxima takes place
at the condition Eq. (30). For the more details acquain-
tance with the diﬀerent regimes of electrons diﬀraction
on a slowed traveling wave in a dielectric medium we refer
the reader to the works [29–33].
