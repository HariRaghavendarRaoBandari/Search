Memristors are resistive elements retaining information of their past dynamics. They have gar-
nered substantial interest due to their potential for representing a paradigm change in electronics,
information processing and unconventional computing. Given the advent of quantum technologies, a
design for a quantum memristor with superconducting circuits may be envisaged. Along these lines,
we introduce such a quantum device whose memristive behavior arises from quasiparticle-induced
tunneling when supercurrents are cancelled. For realistic parameters, we ﬁnd that the relevant hys-
teretic behavior may be observed using current state-of-the-art measurements of the phase-driven
tunneling current. Finally, we develop adequate methods to quantify the memory retention in this
system.

Circuit elements that intrinsically carry a recollection
of their past evolution [1–3] promise to bring forth novel
architectural solutions in information processing and un-
conventional computing [4] due to their passive storage
capabilities. These history-dependent circuit elements
can be both dissipative and non-dissipative, such as mem-
capacitors and meminductors [2, 5], or just dissipative,
such as memristors. Classical memristors [6–9] are ele-
ments whose operational deﬁnition relates the voltage V
and the current I, complemented with an update of an
internal state variable(s) x carrying information of the
electrical history of the system. For a voltage-controlled
memristor

I(t) = G[x(t), V (t), t]V (t),

˙x(t) = f [x(t), V (t), t].

(1)

The memductance (memory conductance) G depends on
both the instantaneous input voltage V and the state
variable x, which tracks the past memristor conﬁgura-
tion via the update function f. Such dynamics leads to
the characteristic pinched hysteresis loops under periodic
driving [3, 6, 7, 10, 11], a strictly non-linear conductive
eﬀect showcasing zero-energy information storage [1].

Even though both the quantization of superconducting
circuits [12] and applications of memristors are well es-
tablished techniques, memristive operation in the realm
of quantum dynamics is a largely unexplored area. From
an intuitive point of view, the combination of power-
ful memristive concepts with quantum resources, such as
superposition and entanglement, promises groundbreak-
ing advances in information and communication sciences.
With this motivation in mind, the idea of a quantum
memristor was recently deﬁned in Ref. [13] by introducing
the fundamental components for engineering memristive

behavior in quantum systems. However, superconducting
circuits naturally include memristive elements in Joseph-
son junctions, a feature exploited in a recently proposed
classical superconducting memristor design [14]. While
this conductance asymmetric superconducting quantum
interference device (CA-SQUID) design was able to pro-
duce hysteretic behavior [14], it did not include the quan-
tum features of the circuit, including the dissipative ori-
gins of the memory or its measurement and quantiﬁca-
tion. These features are of utmost importance, as the
operation of the design is based on quasiparticle tunnel-
ing, whose control and measurement have recently seen
signiﬁcant strives forward [15, 16].

In this Letter, we show that a suitably designed su-
perconducting quantum circuit element with an external
phase bias serves as a prototypical quantum memristor
via low-energy quasiparticle tunneling. To this end, we
describe the device in a fully quantum-mechanical fash-
ion. We apply an ensemble interpretation of the sys-
tem input and output, while the average superconducting
phase diﬀerence stores information of the past dynamics.
We study the hysteretic signature in a regime achievable
with recent quantum nondemolition projective measure-
ments [16], and construct a memory quantiﬁer related
to the accumulation of internal state change. Our pro-
posal represents, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst design of a
superconducting quantum memristor from fundamental
principles, exploiting quasiparticle tunneling in memris-
tive quantum information processing.

The envisioned device has the rf SQUID design shown
in Fig. 1(a). It consists of a superconducting loop with
inductance L, which is interrupted by a dc SQUID with
negligible loop inductance acting as an eﬀective ﬂux-
tunable Josephson junction. The dc SQUID junctions are
made from diﬀerent materials so that they have the same

lowest energy eigenstates of ˆHS and the quasiparticle
spectral density Sqp(ω) now depends on the distribution
function which may, in general, includes both equilib-
rium and non-equilibrium contributions. Note that the
decay rate in Eq. (3) stems from the sin ˆϕ/2 dependence
of the quasiparticle–system coupling and is crucial to the
memristive behavior detailed in the following section. By
using the properties of displaced number states [21], the
squared inner products in Eq. (3) have a convenient co-
sine form valid for any pair of Fock states {|n(cid:105) ,|m(cid:105)},

tween the states involved. While this potentially pro-
vides insight into interesting phenomena when multiple
decay channels are involved [23, 24], we concentrate on
the two-level process and leave such considerations for
future studies.

To understand how memristive behavior emerges from
quasiparticle tunneling, we study the charge ﬂow in the
device. Let ˆa be the annihilation operator for a har-
monic excitation in the system. This allows us to write
ˆϕ = 2g0(ˆa + ˆa†) + ϕd(t) and ˆn = i/(4g0)(ˆa† − ˆa), and
denote by ˆϕind = ˆϕ − ϕd the operator for the phase
over the rf SQUID loop inductance. The directional con-
vention for the superconducting phase diﬀerences and
the diﬀerent currents are presented in Fig. 1(b). The
average charging current (cid:104) ˆIch(cid:105) and the inductive cur-
rent (cid:104) ˆIind(cid:105) can be rigorously derived [21] to obtain, by
current conservation, the average quasiparticle current
through the eﬀective junction. The result is (cid:104) ˆIqp(cid:105) =
2eTr{ ˆD{ˆρ}ˆn} = Γ1→0(−e)(cid:104)ˆn(cid:105), which corresponds to the

critical current but a diﬀerent normal conductance [14].
In this way, the eﬀective critical current of the dc SQUID
can be completely suppressed by a bias ﬂux of half a ﬂux
quantum, Φ0/2, threading its loop [14]. Finally, we also
apply a bias ﬂux Φd to the rf SQUID loop, resulting in
the phase bias ϕd = 2πΦd/Φ0.

The total Hamiltonian of this device is the sum of the
system Hamiltonian ˆHS, a term for the quasiparticle de-
gree of freedom, and a total tunneling term. The latter
includes quasiparticle contributions but, due to the van-
ishing eﬀective critical current [17], neither pair contri-
butions, nor the Josephson counterterm [18–20]. Under
these conditions, the system Hamiltonian takes the har-
monic form

ˆHS = EC ˆn2 +

where ˆn and ˆϕ are the Cooper-pair counting and phase
diﬀerence operators of the eﬀective junction, respectively.
We deﬁne the capacitive energy scale EC = 2e2/Cd with
the intrinsic junction capacitance Cd and the inductive
energy scale EL = (1/L)(Φ0/(2π))2. Regarding the
dc SQUID, we assume the limit of strong conductance
asymmetry needed for the eﬀective junction picture due
to the inclusion of quasiparticle excitations [21]. In this
limit, the dissipative ﬂow is through the physical junc-
tion with a smaller superconducting gap while the junc-
tion with a larger gap functions as a shunt for the to-
tal Josephson current through the SQUID. Furthermore,
we demand that the phase bias is changed adiabatically,
i.e., suﬃciently slowly to avoid the generation of quasi-
particles. Finally, our device operates in the low-energy
regime ω10, δE (cid:28) 2∆, where ω10 =
2ECEL/ is the
system transition frequency and δE is the characteris-
tic energy of the quasiparticles above the gap ∆. Even
though the Hamiltonian does not warrant operation as a
qubit due to the lack of suﬃcient anharmonicity, the sys-
tem dynamics is conﬁned to the two lowest eigenstates of
Eq. (2) when the aforementioned assumptions are com-
plemented with operation in the high-frequency regime
ω10 (cid:29) δE. In this regime, there exist no quasiparticles

Equations (6)–(9) indicate that a simple superconducting
device operates as a voltage-controlled quantum memris-
tor when the average voltage over a tunneling element
is interpreted as the system input, the average quasipar-
ticle tunneling current as the output, and the average
superconducting phase diﬀerence as the memory reten-
tion variable. The quasiparticle conductance acts as the
memductance corresponding to the memory-dependent
average current response.

The operation of the constructed memristor is of en-
semble nature, that is, the system input and output are
quantum averages obtained from the measurement record
of the corresponding observables. Experimental input
consists of initialization and a slowly oscillating ﬂux bias
applied to the rf SQUID loop. In this way, one obtains in-
dependently generated records which, consequently, have
a complex correlation exhibiting memory features via
Eq. (6). In fact, the selected system input is not indepen-

dent of the decay, but experiences a memory-dependent
damping

which allows one to self-consistently solve the fundamen-
tal equations above. One such solution is identiﬁable as
mimicking the operation of the classical superconduct-
ing memristor [14], in which the memory is fully stored
in the phase bias.
It is obtained in the weak-damping
limit by initializing it with (cid:104) ˆV (cid:105)|t=0 = V0 and (cid:104) ˆϕ(cid:105)|t=0 =
ϕd(0), and by assuming a resonant sinusoidal phase bias
ϕd(t) = ϕ0 + (2eV0)/(ω10) sin(ω10t). Weak voltage
damping implies that (cid:104) ˆV (cid:105) ≈ e/(Cdg0)Im{ρ01(0)eiω10t} =
V0 cos(ω10t), where the update is given by the classical
Josephson relation ∂tϕd(t) = 2e/(cid:104) ˆV (cid:105). The solution
embodies the two implicit assumptions for the classical
memristor: (1) the rf SQUID loop has a negligible induc-
tance, and (2) the internal dynamics is negligibly aﬀected
by the same dissipation that produces the output.

As a ﬁrst step, we need to verify whether the above-
described classical-limit solution is consistent with the
semiclassical results of Ref. 14.
In Fig 2, one clearly
sees that we observe the hysteretic current-voltage char-
acteristic curves as required for a memristive element.
In other words, a proper choice of the sinusoidal drive
allows for tunable ﬁnite-area pinched loops [3]. Employ-
ing the system parameters from Fig. 2, the above weak-
damping solution is accurately numerically retrieved with
Sqp(ω10) = 10−4ω10 over multiple oscillation periods.
This corresponds to a minimum relaxation time during
the driving period of min(T1) ∝ 1 ms relevant to the cur-
rent state-of-the-art experimental setups [15, 16]. Even
though (cid:104) ˆIqp(cid:105) ∝ Sqp(ω10), the magnitude-scaled hysteresis
curve is robust against decreasing the minimum T1-time
by 2 orders of magnitude [21]. Beyond this, the input
and output values are subject to noticeable decay. We
show the parametric dependence of the average voltage
and quasiparticle current in Fig. 2 for Sqp(ω10) = ω10
corresponding to min(T1) ∝ 100 ns. The hysteresis curve
starts from a point in the weak-damping trajectory due
to the identical initialization, and it is followed by a re-
duction of the area with time. The time evolution in
Fig. 2 shows a gradual decay in the voltage and cur-
rent amplitudes. Note that the system is operated in the
phase regime of almost negligible loop inductance. This
allows for a feasible resonant phase biasing frequency
ω10 ≈ 45 GHz, achieved while ensuring suﬃcient adia-
baticity max(αrs) ≈ 0.15 [21], necessary for the master-
equation treatment employed for the quasiparticle bath.
The initialization of the system plays a crucial role in
the operation and does not simply determine the initial
position in the parametric curve. Figure 3 shows the hys-
teresis curves for three diﬀerent initializations, assuming

corresponds to the response speciﬁc to the selected mem-
ory variable, and the second term to the explicit time de-
pendence of the memductance not included in the inter-
nal memory variable. However, it is in principle always
possible to redeﬁne the memory variable to absorb the
explicit time dependence in the memductance, so that
Fm(t) = F0(t). The two expressions in Eq. (11) im-
ply that the quantiﬁer corresponds to a time-dependent
weighted record of the change in the memory variable
∂t (cid:104) ˆϕ(cid:105) or the instantaneous distance from its initial value
∆(cid:104) ˆϕ(cid:105) = (cid:104) ˆϕ(cid:105)−(cid:104) ˆϕ(cid:105)|t=tk
. If the conductance is a non-linear
function of only the instantaneous input, Fm(t) vanishes
in integration due to input periodicity. See Supplemental
Material [21] for the decay of the quantiﬁer as well as its
response to diﬀerent initializations.

Finally, our quantum memristor is formulated in the
ideal case of zero leakage supercurrent. Adding a nonzero
pair-tunnelling term, not only modiﬁes the energy and
state structure, but inﬂicts a Josephson tunneling cur-
rent which may disrupt the operation. While there can be
multiple factors contributing to the leakage supercurrent,
such as magnetic ﬂux noise, the primary experimental
factor to tackle is possibly the critical current imbalance
in the SQUID. The state-of-the-art critical current sup-
pression factor based purely on fabrication techniques is
∼10−2 while the balanced SQUID [26] promises a factor
of ∼10−3–10−4, for a maximum critical current of 30 nA.
In terms of the Hamiltonian, this implies that the imbal-
ance term is 10−1–10−3 times the charging energy scale
used here. In addition, our formulation assumes only the
quasiparticle decay channel and omits other natural loss
channels (dielectric, inductive, radiative). Recent experi-
mental work has studied quasiparticle-limited relaxation
and shown signiﬁcant progress in suppressing the addi-
tional decay channels, modifying the quasiparticle pop-
ulation through diﬀerent means, and discerning between

rameters are EC /(2π) = 1 GHz, EL = 103EC, ϕ0 = π/2,
Sqp(ω10) = ω10, and 2eV0/(ω10) = 1. The arrows indicate
the direction of temporal evolution recorded over 10 oscilla-
tion periods T = 2π/ω10 and we use the shorthand notation

the weak-damping limit and a resonant sinusoidal drive
protocol. These curves can be interpreted by studying
the time symmetry of the quasiparticle current between
two consecutive crossings of the zero-energy point and
indicate a tunable landscape of hysteretic behavior [21].
To quantify the non-Markovian [25] character of the
device, we consider the area enclosed by a hysteresis loop
in the current-voltage plane as a memory measurement.
This interpretation is founded in the observation that
the absence of area correlates with purely time-local cur-
rent response. In other words, a nonlinear conductance
cannot produce a non-zero area since it depends only
on the instantaneous value of the voltage. The mem-
ory quantiﬁer for the kth traversed loop takes the form

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a prototype de-
sign for a quantum memristor in a superconducting cir-
cuit relying on quasiparticle tunneling. The pinched hys-
teretic behavior of the average quasiparticle current is
a clear signature of conductance beyond typical non-
linearity, and modiﬁed by both the characteristics of the
circuit and the quasiparticle bath. The measurement
resolution can potentially be varied by tuning the non-
equilibrium quasiparticle population, by just using the
state-of-the-art injection and trapping methods [16] dur-
ing the lifetime of the quasiparticles. Our work paves
the way for the engineering of on-demand quantum non-

THE EFFECTIVE JUNCTION PICTURE IN THE PRESENCE OF QUASIPARTICLE EXCITATIONS

While it is well-known that a SQUID behaves as if it was a single eﬀective junction with a tunable Josephson
energy when pair tunneling is discussed, additional conductance requirements are set by the inclusion of quasiparticle
excitations. Classically speaking, a non-vanishing phase-dependent conductance can be achieved in a conductance-
asymmetric SQUID, while assuming that the physical junctions have equivalent critical currents [1]. Summation
of dissipative currents yields a representation as an eﬀective junction with an eﬀective leakage conductance Geﬀ =
G1 + G2, where Gi is the leakage conductance of the ith physical junction, and an asymmetry term for the phase-
dependent current of Sasym = (G1 − G2)/(G1 + G2) [1].
To use the eﬀective junction picture in the main text in association with quasiparticle tunneling, we assume strong
asymmetry G1 (cid:29) G2 such that Sasym ≈ 1. Hence, the dissipative ﬂow is eﬀectively only through a single junction,
while the total pair current can still be cancelled. This allows for the eﬀective junction picture to be used for
describing quasiparticle tunneling. Since the Ambegaokar-Baratoﬀ relation implies for equivalent critical currents
that G1/G2 = ∆2/∆1, with ∆i is the superconducting gap of the electrodes of the ith physical junction of the
SQUID, this assumption can be enforced by demanding ∆2 (cid:29) ∆1. Weakening the assumption would require the
degrees of freedom of the individual physical qubits to be included in the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2) of the manuscript.
This means that the quasiparticle tunneling Hamiltonian would have to be given for each physical junction separately,
resulting in two separate decay channels, which allows for the weaker conductance discrepancy to manifest. We leave
such considerations for future work and assume the limit of strong conductance asymmetry throughout the main text.

Adiabaticity.– In order to evaluate the adiabaticity of our phase-driven system described by the Hamiltonian in
Eq. (1) of the main text, we calculate the instantaneous adiabatic parameter for the dynamics conﬁned to the
two lowest energy levels. The instantaneous eigenstates of the abovementioned Hamiltonian are the well-known
instantaneous number states [2]

For the dynamics conﬁned to the two lowest levels, the instantaneous adiabatic parameter is α = || ˆw||/ω10, where
w∂t ˆDw generates the Berry connection. Here, ˆDw = |0(t)(cid:105)(cid:104)0f| + |1(t)(cid:105)(cid:104)1f| and

In order for the master equation approach in the main text to be valid, Landau-Zener transitions must be suppressed

This is guaranteed by operating in the regime max(αrs) (cid:28) 1.

Quasiparticle-induced average shift of the system transition frequency.– The existence of quasiparticles induces an
average frequency shift for the system that can be attributed to two diﬀerent mechanisms [3, 4]: the quasiparticle
renormalization of the Josephson energy and the quasiparticle-mediated virtual transitions between diﬀerent energy
levels. In general, each physical junction generates diﬀerent shift terms, since nonvanishing total quasiparticle current
requires conductance asymmetry (see previous section) and, hence, diﬀerent superconducting gaps for the electrodes
of the junctions (∆1 (cid:54)= ∆2). However, our assumption of strong conductance asymmetry (∆1 (cid:28) ∆2) implies that
the frequency shift is dominated by the junction with large quasiparticle ﬂow, so we denote the eﬀective gap by
∆ ≈ ∆1. The renormalization term comprises of contributions from the pair tunneling and Josephson counterterms
(ω10, δE (cid:28) 2∆), as well as the terms in the quasiparticle tunneling Hamiltonian that do not contribute to pure
dephasing and relaxation [4]. Since these contributions are renormalized Josephson energy terms for the individual
junctions, they vanish for our eﬀective junction. For a nonvanishing Josephson term, the quasiparticle contribution
can be approximated knowing the CP-density-normalized quasiparticle density xqp and the energy mode occupation
of the quasiparticles at the gap xA
qp = fE,qp(∆), where fE,qp is the energy mode of the lead quasiparticle distribution
function [3].

By using the assumptions detailed in Ref. [22] of the manuscript, the principal contribution from the virtual

transitions to the ith energy level of the system is [3]

where |i(cid:105) is the ith eigenstate with energy Ei, ωki = Ek − Ei, and Fqp(ω) is an expression involving complex nested
integration of the quasiparticle distribution in energy space [see Appendix A of Ref. [3]]. As it is apparent from
Eq. (18), each energy shift generally accounts for virtual transitions to and from each other state in the Hilbert space.
Our system lacks anharmonicity and, hence, we cannot restrict virtual occupation to the two lowest levels. However,
we operate in the phase regime where g0 = [EC/(32EL)]1/4 (cid:28) 1 and, hence, Eqs. (4) and (5) in the main text imply
that the largest terms in δEi,qp correspond to virtual transitions between i and its energetically nearest levels. Thus,
the frequency shift becomes

the lowest-order contributions stem from the virtual transitions 1 ↔ 0, 0 ↔ 1, and 2 ↔ 1. Making use of the deﬁnition

so that the frequency shift can be omitted. As evident from Eq. (20), the validity of this assumption is determined
by the details of the execution of the low–energy limit given in the main text hindering it and the execution of the
phase–regime as well as typical low quasiparticle densities supporting it. Note that in thermal equilibrium and at
low temperatures T (cid:28) ∆, it is straightforward to support our statement that the frequency shift is dominated by
the junction with large dissipative ﬂow (∆1 (cid:28) ∆2) using Eq. (20), since then δω10,qp ∝ e−∆/kB T . This implies that
δω1

10,qp ∝ e(∆2−∆1)/kB T (cid:29) 1, where the superscript indicates the physical junction.

Pure dephasing.– For our system, whose memristive operation relies solely on a weak but nonvanishing dissipative
current generated by the quasiparticle–induced decay, pure dephasing adds another decoherence channel and, might
potentially destroy the memristive behavior.
Its eﬀect would be to both distort the hysteresis loops by adding
another time-dependent contribution to the quasiparticle current and to increase the memory-dependent damping of
the average voltage by contributing to the total dephasing. Even though our SQUID is necessarily asymmetric as
explained earlier, the individual junctions are assumed symmetric throughout this work. Thus, one would estimate
pure dephasing using the self-consistent rate Γφ in Eq. (28) of Ref. [4] to avoid the issue of logarithmic divergence in
the lowest-order perturbative tunneling treatment. However, the self-consistent rate scales with the system energy as
s = ((cid:104)1| sin ˆϕ/2|1(cid:105) − (cid:104)0| sin ˆϕ/2|0(cid:105))/2 and the inner products can be calculated using the identities in
|Ad
Eqs. (21) and (22). This yields |Ad
0, while the relaxation rate scales
as g2
0. A full comparison of the relaxation and pure dephasing rates would require knowledge of the quasiparticle
distribution to calculate the quasiparticle spectral density in Eq. (3) of the main text, as well as to iteratively solve
the self-consistent expression for the pure dephasing rate. As an example, assuming Γφ (cid:28) δE, the scaling becomes
Γφ ∝ |Ad

distribution can be established in a manner that the beneﬁcial diﬀerence in scaling in the phase regime allows for the
pure dephasing process to be neglected.

Finally, we remind the reader that our construction of the relaxation rate, as well as the considerations on the pure
dephasing rate above, do not only exploit the adiabatic assumption but also that of low charateristic quasiparticle
energies (ω10, δE (cid:28) 2∆). This implies that the secondary terms in the rate equations in Ref. [4] can typically be
omitted, since they are negligible in comparison to the primary terms we use throughout this work. However, our
system crosses points during the phase-driving process in which the primary terms vanish and the secondary terms
become the dominating contributions, ensuring that the total rates are nonvanishing. For example, the secondary
0(1 − cos ϕd)/2, which reaches its maximum value at the point
term in the relaxation rate is proportional to e−g2
0 g2
0(1 + cos ϕd)/2, that is, at ϕ = π + 2πn, n ∈ Z. Even though the
of vanishing primary term proportional to e−g2
0 g2
secondary terms dominate near these points, we assume that their contribution to the total dissipative ﬂow during
the full driving cycle is negligible due to the aforementioned assumptions. If low characteristic quasiparticle energies
cannot be guaranteed, the full rate equations should be applied to study the potentially modiﬁed memristive function.

DERIVATION OF THE CHARGING, INDUCTIVE, AND QUASIPARTICLE CURRENTS

The average charging current for the junction is given by

2e

 ELTr{ˆρ( ˆϕ − ϕd)} − 2eTr{ ˆD{ˆρ}ˆn},

(24)

(25)

where we assumed a Lindblad-form evolution ∂t ˆρ = −i/[ ˆHS, ˆρ] + ˆD{ˆρ} for the system density ˆρ, and used the
properties of the bosonic operators to rewrite the commutator [ˆn, ˆHS] = −iω10(ˆa†+ˆa)/(4g0), after applying Ehrenfest
theorem. By employing the operator for the current through the inductive element ˆIind = −2e/EL( ˆϕ − ϕd), the
average inductive current is

(cid:104) ˆIind(cid:105) = Tr{ˆρ ˆIind} = − 2e

 ELTr{ˆρ( ˆϕ − ϕd)}.

(26)

Hence, current conservation dictates that (cid:104) ˆIqp(cid:105) = −(cid:104) ˆIch(cid:105) − (cid:104) ˆIind(cid:105) = 2eTr{ ˆD{ˆρ}ˆn}. We assume the high-energy low-
frequency regime discussed in the main text, so that ˆD{ˆρ} = ˆLˆρ ˆL† − { ˆL† ˆL, ˆρ}/2, where ˆL =
Γ1→0ˆa. Decomposing
ˆD{ˆρ}ˆn inside the trace and using the properties of ˆa yields (cid:104) ˆIqp(cid:105) = Γ1→0(−e)(cid:104)ˆn(cid:105), given in the main text.

DECAY OF HYSTERESIS WITH RESPECT TO THE SCALING OF T1-TIMES

The same decay that enables hysteresis is responsible for the gradual decrease of the quasiparticle current due to
dephasing. Observation of hysteresis requires a suﬃcently large T1-time to be achieved. To estimate the bath-induced
decay of the input and output values with respect to the scaling of the T1-times, we present the change in the average
quasiparticle current after 10 consecutive driving cycles in Fig. 4. Since the system is initialized to the classical
trajectory, (cid:104) ˆIqp(cid:105)|t=0 corresponds to the value that the classical memristor returns after each driving cycle. Note
that the memory-dependent damping in the input (cid:104) ˆV (cid:105) determines the decay and, hence, has the same scaling as the
output. As brieﬂy mentioned in the main text, the magnitude-scaled parametric hysteresis curves do not noticeably
decay after 10 cycles for the orders of magnitude of the T1-times between 1 ms and 10 µs. This is noticeable in Fig. 4,
where the quasiparticle current after 10 cycles does not return to its original value when log[Sqp(ω10)/ω10] > −2.

EFFECT OF INITIALIZATION ON THE HYSTERETIC BEHAVIOR AND MEMORY QUANTIFIER

Here, we provide a qualitative interpretation for the varied hysteretic curves displayed in Fig. 3 of the main text.
As in Fig. 2 of the main text, initially assuming a nonzero voltage over the SQUID and a negligible inductive phase
diﬀerence yields hysteresis with π-rotational symmetry in the current-voltage plane (blue curve). On the other hand,
assuming vanishing initial voltage and nonzero inductive phase diﬀerence destroys the hysteretic behavior (red curve).
Finally, assuming that both are nonvanishing allows for voltage-asymmetric hysteresis (black curve). Each case can
be seen as an example of the time-symmetry of the quasiparticle current between two consecutive crossings of the
zero-energy point. With sinusoidal driving, both the voltage and the memristance are time symmetric, whereas the
symmetry of their product, the quasiparticle current, depends on the speciﬁc initialization. Hence, tuning the initial
conditions yields a variety of diﬀerent memristic switchings which can, in general, be made voltage asymmetric. The

parametric current-voltage characteristics can also be tuned by resorting to diﬀerent bias protocols which may help
to achieve desired behavior.

AREA OF A HYSTERESIS LOOP AS A MEMORY MEASUREMENT

For a classical voltage-controlled memristive system, the current response is generally given by [6]

I(t) = G(γ(t), V (t), t)V (t),

(27)

where G(γ, V (t), t) is the memductance, which depends on the instantaneous value of the input voltage V (t), the
accumulated value of the memory variable γ(t), and the time t in a parametric manner. The memory variable update
is deﬁned by

∂tγ(t) = f (γ(t), V (t), t),

(28)

where the update function f depends on the past evolution, the input and any external parametric driving. Notice
that the general deﬁnitions used above allow for tracking a speciﬁc state variable γ rather than absorbing the total
response into a generalized memory variable γx such that G(γx) = G(γ, V, t) where γx = fx(γx, V, t) now updates the
new variable. This absorption can always be done, since memductance is a system property depending on the input
and external driving via the state variable.

reached again. Assuming pinched hysteresis, the periodicity condition is conveniently written as V (nT ) = 0, n ∈ Z.
Due to this condition, the second term in Eq. (30) yields

where ∆γ(t) = γ(t)− γ(0) is the change in the memory variable from its initial value, we executed integration by parts
after the ﬁrst equality, and the ﬁrst term after the ﬁrst equality vanishes due to the periodicity condition. Applying
the results in Eqs. (32) and (34) yields the deﬁnition of the loop area as a memory quantiﬁer given in the main text
for our superconducting circuit.
