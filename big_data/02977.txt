ABSTRACT

Motivated by the need for accurate frequency information,
a novel algorithm for estimating the fundamental frequency
and its rate of change in three-phase power systems is devel-
oped. This is achieved through two stages of Kalman ﬁltering.
In the ﬁrst stage a quaternion extended Kalman ﬁlter, which
provides a uniﬁed framework for joint modeling of voltage
measurements from all the phases, is used to estimate the in-
stantaneous phase increment of the three-phase voltages. The
phase increment estimates are then used as observations of
the extended Kalman ﬁlter in the second stage that accounts
for the dynamic behavior of the system frequency and simul-
taneously estimates the fundamental frequency and its rate
of change. The framework is then extended to account for
the presence of harmonics. Finally, the concept is validated
through simulation on both synthetic and real-world data.

Index Terms— Three-phase power systems, frequency
estimation, quaternion-valued signal processing, multistage

1. INTRODUCTION

The power grid is designed to operate optimally at its nomi-
nal frequency; furthermore, deviations from the nominal sys-
tem frequency adversely affects the components of the power
grid [1], such as compensators and loads, resulting in harmful
operating conditions that can propagate throughout the net-
work. Thus, making frequency stability as one of the most
important factors in the assessment of power quality [2]. In
addition, future envisioned smart grid technologies will incor-
porate distributed power generation based on renewable en-
ergy sources, where the wide-area grid can be divided into a
number of smaller self-contained sections named micro-grids,
with some micro-grids disconnecting from the wide-area grid
for prolonged lengths of time, referred to as islanding [3].
Therefore, monitoring the frequency information of the grid
in real-time is an essential part of power distribution network
control and management applications.

The importance of frequency estimation in power grids
has motivated the development of a variety of algorithms
dedicated to this cause [4]-[13], where approaches based on
Kalman ﬁltering have been shown to be advantageous due to
their underlying state space assumption [10]-[13]. However,
these algorithms act as frequency measurement techniques
and do not reveal any information about the dynamics of the
system frequency which holds essential information about the
power grid. For example, a rising system frequency indicates
that power generation has surpassed power consumption and
a falling system frequency is indicative that power consump-
tion has exceeded power generation [3],[9].

Although the voltage measurements from the three phases
can be mapped onto the complex domain using the Clarke
transform, which allows for the use of well established
complex-valued signal processing techniques, complex num-
bers lack the dimensionality necessary to model three-phase
systems leading to partial loss of information specially un-
der unbalanced operating conditions which negatively effects
the performance complex-valued frequency estimators [13].
Quaternions provide a natural presentation for three and
four-dimensional signals and have gained popularity in an
increasing number of engineering applications [13]-[17]. In
addition, the recent introduction of the HR-calculus [18]
and augmented quaternion statistics [19]-[20] have led a
resurgence in quaternion-valued signal processing and have
inspired a number of quaternion-valued signal processing al-
gorithms including a class of quaternion Kalman ﬁlters [21].

In this work, a novel two stage Kalman ﬁltering algo-
rithm is developed for adaptive estimation of frequency and
its rate of change in three-phase power systems. The ﬁrst
stage is consisted of a strictly linear quaternion extended
Kalman ﬁlter (QEKF) that allows for the incorporation of
the voltage measurements from all phases and estimates the
instantaneous phase increment of the three-phase voltages.
The instantaneous phase increment estimates from the ﬁrst
stage are then used as observations of a real-valued extended
Kalman ﬁlter (EKF) in the second stage that estimates the
system frequency and its rate of change. Moreover, a frame-

work for accounting for the presence of harmonics in the
power system is presented. The concept is veriﬁed through
simulations on both synthetic data mirroring practical power
grid scenarios and real-world data recordings.

2. QUATERNIONS

Quaternions are a non-commutative division algebra denoted
by H. A quaternion variable q ∈ H consists of a real part
ℜ(q) and a three-dimensional imaginary part or pure quater-
nion, ℑ(q), which comprises three imaginary components
ℑi(q), ℑj(q), and ℑk(q); therefore, q can be expressed as
q = ℜ(q) + ℑ(q) = ℜ(q) + ℑi(q) + ℑj(q) + ℑk(g) =
qr + iqi + jqj + kqk, where qr, qi, qj, qk ∈ R, while i, j,
and k are imaginary units obeying the product rules ij = k,
jk = i, ki = j, and i2 = j 2 = k2 = ijk = −1.

Alternatively a quaternion q ∈ H can be expressed by the

where

q = |q|eξθ = |q|(cid:0)cos(θ) + ξsin(θ)(cid:1)
ℜ(q) (cid:19) .
and θ = atan(cid:18)|ℑ(q)|
ξ = ℑ(q)
|ℑ(q)|

sin(θ) =

2ξ (cid:0)eξθ − e−ξθ(cid:1) , cos(θ) =

Moreover, it is straightforward to prove that the sin(·) and
cos(·) functions can be expressed as
2(cid:0)eξθ + e−ξθ(cid:1)
where ξ2 = −1.
The involution of q ∈ H around η ∈ H is deﬁned as
qη , ηqη−1 [23] and can be used to express the real-valued
components of a quaternion number, q ∈ H, as [17]-[19],[21]
4i(cid:0)q + qi − qj − qk(cid:1) (1)
qr =
4k(cid:0)q − qi − qj + qk(cid:1) .

4(cid:0)q + qi + qj + qk(cid:1)

lutions and is deﬁned as

a class of quaternion Kalman ﬁlters including the strictly lin-
ear QEKF [21] that operates akin to its complex-valued coun-
terpart, with the difference that the Jacobian of the state evolu-
tion function is calculated by the HR-calculus. For instance,
∂q∗
∂q = −0.5, which is a consequence of (2) and is in contrast
with the results in the complex domain.

3. QUATERNION FREQUENCY ESTIMATOR

The instantaneous voltages of each phase in a three-phase
power system are given by

va,n =Va,nsin (2πfn∆T n + φa,n)

vb,n =Vb,nsin(cid:16)2πfn∆T n + φb,n +
vc,n =Vc,nsin(cid:16)2πfn∆T n + φc,n +

where Va,n, Vb,n, and Vc,n are the instantaneous amplitudes,
φa,n, φb,n, and φc,n represent the instantaneous phases, and
∆T = 1/fs is the sampling interval with fs denoting the
sampling frequency, while fn denotes the system frequency
at time instant n. Considering that the dynamic changes in
system frequency can be modeled as a time varying function
given by fn = g(n∆T ); then, taking the Taylor series expan-
sion yields

Taking into account the linear regressions in (5) a state space
model for the system frequency that can be implemented us-
ing the real-valued EKF is proposed in Algorithm 1, where
νn and ωn denote the state evolution and observation noise.
The three phase voltages in (3) are now combined together

to generate the pure quaternion signal

The expressions in (1) establish a relation between the aug-
mented quaternion variable, [q, qi, qj, qk]T ∈ H4, and the
real-valued vector [qr, qi, qj, qk]T ∈ R4. This duality be-
tween the real and quaternion domains forms the basis of
the quaternion augmented statistics [19]-[20] and the HR-
calculus [18]. The augmented quaternion statistics in con-
junction with the HR-calculus have led to the development of

qn = iva,n + jvb,n + kvc,n.

(6)

Since all three phases have the same frequency, analytical
geometry dictates that qn will trace an ellipse in a subspace

1The framework developed in this work can be expanded to account for
additional terms of the Taylor series expansion in (4) if further information
about the dynamics of the system frequency is required.

the set of imaginary bases {ζ, ζ′, ζ′′} such that
ζζ′ = ζ′′, ζ′ζ′′ = ζ, ζ′′ζ = ζ′

(7)
and the imaginary units {ζ, ζ′} are designed to reside in the
same plane as qn, resulting in ζ′′ being normal to this plane.
In our previous work we show that an arbitrary ellipse in the
ζ − ζ′ plane can then be divided into two counter rotating
circular components q+

using the strictly linear QEKF presented in [21].

Gaussian variables, makes it possible to model the estimate

real-valued white Gaussian noise. Therefore, the relation

Harmonic contamination is a major cause of error in
power system frequency estimators and therefore it is crucial
to present a framework for accounting for the presence of the
main harmonic components. In this setting, the estimate of
the system frequency is used as feedback in order to estimate
the signal component at m-times the main frequency. This
is achieved through the use of multiple QEKF connected in
parallel as shown in Figure 2, where each QEKF is imple-
menting the state space model in Algorithm 2. The process is
summarized in Algorithm 3, where ˆxm,n|n−1, ˆxm,n|n, Am,n,
and Cυ
m,n are the a priori state estimate, a posteriori state
estimate, the Jacobian of the state evolution equation, and the
covariance matrix of the state evolution noise at time instant
n for the QEKF estimating the mth harmonic component,
while Cυ
m,n is covariance matrix of the observation noise,
with h = [0 1 1] denoting the observation function.

noise ratio of 30dB.

In the ﬁrst experiment, the three-phase system was con-
sidered to be operating under balanced conditions, at its nom-
inal frequency of 50Hz, and free of harmonics; then suffered
a voltage sag characterized by an 80% fall in the amplitude of
va and 20 degree phase shifts in vb and vc; furthermore, the
voltage sag resulted in the introduction of a balanced 10%
third harmonic component and a 0.2Hz fall in system fre-
quency. The estimates of the system frequency obtained at
the ﬁrst and second stages of the developed algorithm are
shown in Figure 3. Notice that the developed algorithm ac-
curately estimated the system frequency under both balanced
and unbalanced conditions regardless of the presence of the
third harmonic.

a smaller steady state variance.
