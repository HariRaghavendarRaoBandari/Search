ABSTRACT
Massive star formation requires the accretion of gas at high rate while the star is
already bright. Its actual luminosity depends sensitively on the stellar structure. We
compute pre-main-sequence tracks for massive and intermediate-mass stars with vari-
able accretion rates and study the evolution of stellar radius, eﬀective temperature
and ionizing luminosity, starting at 2 M(cid:12) with convective or radiative structures. The
radiative case shows a much stronger swelling of the protostar for high accretion rates
than the convective case. For radiative structures, the star is very sensitive to the
accretion rate and reacts quickly to accretion bursts, leading to considerable changes
in photospheric properties on timescales as short as 100 – 1000 yr. The evolution for
convective structures is much less inﬂuenced by the instantaneous accretion rate, and
produces a monotonically increasing ionizing ﬂux that can be many orders of magni-
tude smaller than in the radiative case. For massive stars, it results in a delay of the
H ii region expansion by up to 10,000 yr. In the radiative case, the H ii region can
potentially be engulfed by the star during the swelling, which never happens in the
convective case. We conclude that the early stellar structure has a large impact on the
radiative feedback during the pre-main-sequence evolution of massive protostars and
introduces an important uncertainty that should be taken into account. Because of
their lower eﬀective temperatures, our convective models may hint at a solution to an
observed discrepancy between the luminosity distribution functions of massive young
stellar objects and compact H ii regions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Massive stars govern their environment through their vari-
ous feedbacks: dynamical, chemical and radiative. In partic-
ular, their strong UV radiation ﬁeld is able to ionize large
regions of gas in their surrounding. It is expected that such
an H ii region forms around a star as soon as its mass ex-
ceeds ∼ 10 M(cid:12) (Stahler & Palla 2004). Due to the high
pressure of the ionized gas, it was expected in the past that
the growth of such an H ii region could reverse the accretion
ﬂow and prevent further accretion, ﬁxing the upper stellar
mass limit at ∼ 25 M(cid:12) (Larson & Starrﬁeld 1971). However,
recent three-dimensional simulations including ionizing feed-
back (Peters et al. 2010a,b,c, 2011) have shown that accre-

tion is not halted by the high pressure of this hot ionized
gas. Indeed, it appears in these simulations that H ii regions
show signiﬁcant time variability and geometrical irregularity,
that allow the accretion ﬂow to survive the increase in the
gas pressure in the ionized regions. Interestingly, this time
variability appears to be in good agreement with observa-
tions (Hughes 1988; Franco-Hern´andez & Rodr´ıguez 2004;
Rodr´ıguez et al. 2007; Galv´an-Madrid et al. 2008; G´omez
et al. 2008; De Pree et al. 2014, 2015; Rivilla et al. 2015).
Such variations may result from various causes, some related
to the accretion ﬂow itself (Peters et al. 2010a,b; Galv´an-
Madrid et al. 2011; Klassen et al. 2012a), some related to the
variations in the radiation ﬁeld of the forming star (Klassen
et al. 2012b).

The pre-main-sequence (MS) evolution of massive stars
remains an open issue. The models of Bernasconi & Maeder

2

L. Haemmerl´e & T. Peters

(1996) and Norberg & Maeder (2000), computed with accre-
tion rates in the range 10−5 − 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1, showed that
a forming star accreting at such rates reaches the zero-age-
main-sequence (ZAMS) at a mass of 8−10 M(cid:12). Values above
this limit can only be reached on the MS, so that in this case
no pre-MS massive stars exist, and thus H ii regions can form
only around stars that are already on the MS. Behrend &
Maeder (2001) computed models with a time-dependent ac-
cretion rate, starting from the same ∼ 10−5M(cid:12) yr−1 when
the star is still in the low-mass range, but reaching values
above 10−3M(cid:12) yr−1 when the star becomes massive. With
this rate, they were able to reach (cid:39) 20 M(cid:12) before the ZAMS.
Moreover, on the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram, the
evolutionary track of a star accreting at such a rate remains
relatively close to the ZAMS: as the stellar mass grows, both
luminosity and eﬀective temperature increase. In this case
one expects the radiative feedback of a pre-MS star to be
similar to the one of a ZAMS star having the same mass,
allowing H ii regions to form around pre-MS stars already.
Hosokawa & Omukai (2009) and Hosokawa et al.
(2010) computed models with constant accretion rates of
10−3M(cid:12) yr−1, and reached the ZAMS at an even higher
mass of 30 M(cid:12). However, in the models of Hosokawa &
Omukai (2009) and Hosokawa et al. (2010), the high ac-
cretion rate in the low- and intermediate-mass range leads
to a rapid swelling of the accreting star when its mass
is ∼ 10 M(cid:12), and during which the stellar radius reaches
∼ 100 R(cid:12). When such a swelling occurs, the stellar surface
cools down and one expects the ionizing ﬂux to be decreased
signiﬁcantly during this stage. Using these stellar models,
Klassen et al. (2012b) deduced the evolution of the size of the
corresponding H ii region, and compared it to purely ZAMS
models. They obtained H ii regions of signiﬁcant sizes al-
ready in the intermediate-mass range, with both ZAMS and
pre-MS models. However, while the size of the H ii region
was growing monotonically when they used a ZAMS model,
the results were more complex with the pre-MS models of
Hosokawa & Omukai (2009): in this case, the swelling of the
star reduces the eﬀective temperature, so that the H ii re-
gion disappears completely in a few thousand years. Then,
as the star contracts again towards the ZAMS, the eﬀective
temperature increases again and the H ii region recovers its
pre-swelling size in a timescale of the same order.

The models of Hosokawa & Omukai (2009) are based
on the assumption of constant accretion rates. But all the
hydrodynamic simulations for the accretion ﬂow that were
computed in three dimensions show that the accretion rate
on forming stars is highly variable, on the same timescale
of several thousand years, due to the formation of spiral
arms in the accretion discs (e.g. Banerjee et al. 2006; Pe-
ters et al. 2010a,c, 2011; Kuiper et al. 2011; Seifried et al.
2011; Girichidis et al. 2012; Klassen et al. 2012a). Thus
we expect the combined eﬀects of time-dependent accretion
rates and pre-MS stellar evolution to be much more complex
than those of stellar evolution at constant rate only. Tak-
ing these eﬀects into account requires to compute pre-MS
stellar models using the time-dependent accretion rates ob-
tained from hydrodynamic simulations, instead of constant
accretion rates.

Moreover, Haemmerl´e et al. (2016) showed that the pre-
MS evolution of an accreting star depends sensitively on
the choice of the initial model. In particular, they obtained

that for the typical rate 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1 the rapid swelling
of the star described by Hosokawa & Omukai (2009) and
Hosokawa et al. (2010) does not occur for any initial con-
ﬁguration1. Thus one expects the evolution of the ionizing
radiation ﬁeld of accreting stars, and then the properties of
the H ii regions around them, to depend signiﬁcantly on the
initial conditions.

In the present work, we explore these various eﬀects. In
Sect. 2, we describe the physical inputs and the results of
the stellar models; in Sect. 3, we compute the evolution of
the size of the H ii regions from the various stellar feedback
we obtained; these results are discussed in Sect. 4 and the
conclusions are summarized in Sect. 5.

2 STELLAR MODELS

2.1 Accretion histories

We take accretion histories from a simulation of massive
star formation that includes feedback by both ionizing radi-
ation and by heating of the gas through absorption of non-
ionizing radiation by dust (Peters et al. 2010a,b,c). We use
the instantaneous mass and accretion rate of seven stars
from Run B of Peters et al. (2010a) as input for our pre-MS
evolution models. Three of these stars have reached masses
around 20 M(cid:12) and have produced H ii regions in the sim-
ulation. Four stars are in the intermediate-mass range and
have not created an H ii region yet. The main parameters
of these accretion histories are the ﬁnal mass Mf , the du-
ration of the accretion period dacc and the mean accretion
rate ˙Mmean. We summarize these parameters in Table 1.

In these simulations, the UV luminosity is computed
with the assumption that the star is on the ZAMS at all
times, so the UV output in these simulations is systemati-
cally overestimated. Also, because the UV luminosity grows
monotonically with mass, there is no ﬂickering in the simula-
tions caused by stellar evolution. Klassen et al. (2012b) have
investigated the diﬀerences in UV output and H ii region ra-
dius with an improved stellar evolution subgrid model and
detailed stellar evolution calculations and found major dif-
ferences (their Figure 2). Therefore, the more detailed stellar
evolution calculations presented here would modify the UV
output in the original simulations by Peters et al. (2010a).

2.2 Stellar evolution code

We compute stellar evolution models with the Geneva Stel-
lar Evolution code, using the seven accretion histories de-
scribed in Sect. 2.1. The treatment of accretion in the code
has been recently improved (Haemmerl´e et al. 2016), and a
full description of the new treatment is available in Haem-
merl´e (2014). Notice that a more general description of the

1 We notice that Hosokawa et al. (2010) described the eﬀect of
changing the initial conditions (see their Sect. 3.2.2). But despite
the various magnitudes they obtained for the swelling, they con-
cluded that the swelling is a strong feature of pre-MS evolution at
high accretion rates. We notice also that the eﬀect of the initial
conditions on the pre-MS evolution at low rates has been studied
by Hartmann et al. (1997).

code is available in Eggenberger et al. (2008). Here we only
recall brieﬂy the main ideas.

The code is one-dimensional and hydrostatic (i.e. we
model only the hydrostatic core, under the accretion shock).
At each timestep dt, from t to t(cid:48) = t + dt, the accretion
˙M = dM/dt is ﬁxed externally, by hand or using a
rate
pre-deﬁned accretion law, here the accretion histories of
Sect. 2.1. The model t(cid:48) is obtained from the model t by:

• computing the new mass M(cid:48) = M + dM = M + ˙M dt ;
• deﬁning the thermal properties of the accreted mate-
rial ;• solving the four equations of stellar structure for (t(cid:48), M(cid:48))

with the Henyey method.

For the thermal properties of the accreted material, we
use the assumption of cold disc accretion (Palla & Stahler
1992; Hosokawa et al. 2010), stating that the entropy of the
material accreted during dt is the same as the one of the
stellar surface in the model t. This assumption corresponds
to the case of an accretion ﬂow having a disc geometry, in
which any entropy excess can be radiated eﬃciently in the
polar directions before it is advected in the stellar interior.
This is the lower limit for the accretion of entropy, the upper
limit being the spherical accretion (e.g. Hosokawa & Omukai
2009), in which all the entropy of the accretion ﬂow is ad-
vected in the stellar interior.

During the main accretion phase, the stellar timestep dt
is much shorter than the timestep d˜t of the hydrodynamic
simulation. Thus, in order to conserve the (t, M ) relation,
˙M (t) := ˙M (˜t),
we use a stepwise ﬁt for the accretion rate:
where ˜t is the time of the hydrodynamic simulation for which
˜t − d˜t < t ≤ ˜t.

2.3 Initial models

For numerical reasons, we start the computations at the
point when the stellar mass is already 2 M(cid:12). In the simpli-
˙M = 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1,
ﬁed case of a constant accretion rate of
Haemmerl´e et al. (2016) showed that the evolution of the
star during the accretion phase depends sensitively on the
internal structure of the initial model. In the present work,
we used two diﬀerent initial models in order to check how
this choice changes the stellar evolution during the accretion
phase with the more realistic time-dependent accretion rates
considered here.

The signiﬁcant diﬀerence between these two initial mod-
els is the entropy proﬁles (Fig. 1). The model CV, which is
fully convective, has a ﬂat entropy proﬁle, i.e. convection is
adiabatic. In contrast, the model RD is fully radiative and

has thus an entropy gradient ds/dMr > 0. The central en-
tropy in model RD is thus much lower than in model CV.
As a consequence, the model RD is more compact than the
model CV. Indeed, using the homology relations for central
pressure and temperature (Pc ∼ M 2/R4 and Tc ∼ M/R),
the entropy reads
sc ∼ − ln

∼ ln(M R3)

so that, for a given mass M , the lower is the central entropy,
the smaller is the radius. While the model CV has a radius of
20.4 R(cid:12), the radius of the model RD is 2.9 R(cid:12) only, i.e. the
radius of RD is smaller by one order of magnitude than the
radius of CV. In terms of surface properties, this diﬀerence
leads to a much higher luminosity in the CV case than in
the RD case (L ∝ R2T 4

Moreover, the low central entropy in the model RD cor-
responds also to a high central temperature. Indeed, the ho-
mology relations give also
sc ∼ ln
(4)
In the model CV, we have Tc = 7.7× 105 K, while in RD we
have Tc = 9.3 × 106 K. Due to this high temperature, the
opacity is low in RD and the radiative transport is eﬃcient
enough for the total ﬂux: this is the reason why the model
RD is not convective.

Another diﬀerence between CV and RD is the deu-
terium abundance. In the model CV, the value of Tc is lower
than the value for signiﬁcant D-burning, and we can take
the usual ISM mass fraction X2 = 5 × 10−5 (Bernasconi &
Maeder 1996; Norberg & Maeder 2000; Behrend & Maeder
2001; Haemmerl´e et al. 2013, 2016). But in contrast to the
CV model, the value of Tc in the RD model is much higher
than the value for signiﬁcant D-burning, and we expect all
the deuterium to be destroyed in the previous stages that
lead to such an ”initial” model. For this reason, we take
X2 = 0 in the initial model RD. However, in the accreted
material, we keep the value X2 = 5 × 10−5 in both cases.

4

L. Haemmerl´e & T. Peters

We stress that the models considered here as ”initial”
have a relatively high mass, and that their properties reﬂect
an earlier evolution which is not treated in the present work.
In the models of Hosokawa & Omukai (2009) and Hosokawa
et al. (2010), computed respectively with the assumptions
of spherical and disc accretion, once the stellar mass reaches
2 M(cid:12), the radius is (cid:39) 30 R(cid:12) in the spherical case, and (cid:39) 3−
4 R(cid:12) in the disc case. If we compare these two values with the
radii of our CV and RD initial models, we see that the CV
model corresponds roughly to the spherical case and the RD
model to the disc case2. Thus we consider the CV model as
the case where accretion is spherical until (cid:39) 2 M(cid:12) and then
proceeds through a disc, while the RD model corresponds
to the case where accretion proceeds through a disc already
since M << 2 M(cid:12).

2.4 Results

2.4.1 Accretion history 1

We ﬁrst consider the evolution of the central star (accre-
tion history 1). The evolution of the internal structure for
both initial models CV and RD is shown on Fig. 2, together
with the evolution of the mass and the accretion rate. In
this case, the mass M = 2 M(cid:12) corresponding to our initial
stellar models is reached at an age3 of 25 700 years. As we
see on Fig. 2, the accretion rate at this ”initial” age is rel-
˙M = 9 × 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1. Then
atively high, with a value
it decreases progressively, with several oscillations, but it
remains in the range [10−4, 10−3] M(cid:12) yr−1 until an age of
65 000 years (log age [yr] = 4.81). Then it oscillates between
0 and ∼ 2 × 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1, vanishing eventually at an age
of 110 000 years (log age [yr] = 5.04), leaving the star with
its ﬁnal mass, M = 23.4 M(cid:12).

In the case CV, the evolution starts with a fully con-
vective structure. As mentioned in Sect. 2.3, the central
temperature is too low for D-burning, and the star takes
its energy from gravitational contraction, loosing entropy
(grav = −T ds/dt) and decreasing its radius (Eq. 1). After
∼ 1000 years (M (cid:39) 3 M(cid:12)), the central temperature reaches
1.5×106 K and D-burning becomes signiﬁcant. The thermo-
static eﬀect of D-burning slows down the increase of Tc, and
the radius starts to increase as the mass grows (Tc ∼ M/R).
The mass fraction of deuterium decreases with time in the
whole star, until it becomes too small for deuterium to sup-
ply through its burning the energy needed by the star: the
central temperature can increase again (Tc → 2.5 × 106 K)
and the radius stops growing (R (cid:39) 22.7 R(cid:12)). Due to the in-
crease of Tc, the opacity decreases in the centre and at an age
of 35 700 years (M = 7.9 M(cid:12)) a radiative core appears. The
ﬂux emerging from this hot radiative core with low opacity is
too strong for the convective envelope, which is still cold and
has a high opacity. Thus the envelope absorbs a large frac-
tion (∼ 50 − 80 %) of this ﬂux (dLr/dMr < 0), its entropy
increases (dLr/dMr (cid:39) −T ds/dt), and the stellar radius too.

2 We notice however that the model of Hosokawa & Omukai
(2009) with spherical accretion is fully radiative at 2 M(cid:12), while
our CV model is fully convective, despite it has a radius of the
same order.

In all the stellar models, we consider the age since the begin-

ning of the hydrodynamic simulation.

ternal structure of the stellar models obtained from it, for the two
initial models described in Sect. 2.3. On the panels of the inter-
nal structure, the upper curve is the stellar radius, the convective
zones are indicated by dark gray areas and the radiative zones by
light gray areas.

The accreted deuterium burns in the convective envelope,
and the entropy released by this shell-burning enhances the
swelling4. As the temperature increases in the whole star,
the radiative core grows in mass, and the luminosity peak
between the deep regions where dLr/dMr > 0 and the exter-
nal regions where dLr/dMr < 0 moves outwards (luminos-
ity wave, Larson 1972). Eventually, the convective envelope
disappears and the whole star becomes radiative. The ﬂux
coming from the central regions is no longer absorbed by
the envelope, all the layers of the star are loosing entropy,
and the swelling ends: after the radius reached a maximum
of Rmax = 44 R(cid:12) (at an age of 42 300 years and a mass of
10.7 M(cid:12)), it starts to decrease again. The fully radiative star
contracts towards the ZAMS and the central temperature in-

burning in the evolution is studied in Appendix B.

creases from a few 106 K to 25×106 K. At this temperature,
H-burning becomes signiﬁcant in the centre, and the energy
liberated produces a convective core. The contraction stops,
the radius reaches a minimum of 5.6 R(cid:12) and the star enters
the MS. The star reaches its ﬁnal mass of 23.4 M(cid:12) nearly at
this stage: the end of accretion and the ZAMS coincides in
this case.

In contrast to the CV case, the evolution in the RD
case starts with a fully radiative structure, without deu-
terium. However, as soon as the initial model accretes mass,
the deuterium contained in this accreted material can burn:
indeed, in this hot initial model, T = 1.7 × 106 K already
at Mr/M = 97%. The energy liberated by this D-burning
produces a convective envelope, as it is visible on the lower
panel of Fig. 2. Thus in the RD case, we start the evolution
with the luminosity wave and the swelling phase: a signif-
icant fraction of the ﬂux emerging from the hot radiative
core is absorbed in the envelope. But in this case, due to the
low surface luminosity (Eq. 3), the envelope radiates this
entropy with a much lower eﬃciency than in the CV case.
As a consequence, the swelling is much stronger: the radius
soon exceeds 100 R(cid:12) (at an age of 29 300 years), and reaches
its maximum value of 198 R(cid:12) at 35 400 years. Thus we see
that the swelling does not occur at the same age in the RD
case than in the CV case. Then the star contracts again.
In the beginning of the contraction, an intermediate con-
vective zone survives near the surface, due to the remaining
D-burning. But the star becomes rapidly fully radiative, and
contracts towards the ZAMS, which is reached nearly at the
end of accretion, as in the CV case.

The evolutionary tracks of these two models are shown
on Fig. 3. As we see, with its relatively weak swelling, the
model CV follows a track that is qualitatively similar to the

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–16

birthlines at low rates (see e.g. Palla & Stahler 1992), mov-
ing leftwards towards the ZAMS (i.e. Teﬀ increases monoton-
ically). In particular, the luminosity remains under ∼ 104 L(cid:12)
until the post-swelling contraction, when the eﬀective tem-
perature increased above 10 000 K. In contrast, the model
RD, with its strong swelling, starts its evolution along a
nearly straight line towards the luminous and red regions
of the HR diagram (i.e. Teﬀ decreases). At the maximum of
the swelling, the star reaches a luminosity of ∼ 104 L(cid:12) with
an eﬀective temperature as low as 4000 K. Then, as the star
contracts, it moves leftwards towards the ZAMS (i.e. Teﬀ
increases).

In Appendix A we show that it is indeed the size of
the initial radiative core, and not the size of the total initial
stellar radius, that determines the magnitude of the swelling.

2.4.2 Accretion histories 2 to 7

The evolution of the internal structure for accretion histories
2 to 7 is qualitatively similar to the case of accretion history
1. The evolutionary tracks are shown on Fig. 4.
For accretion histories 2, 3, 6 and 7, the star is still in
the intermediate-mass range ((cid:39) 7 M(cid:12)) at the end of the sim-
ulation (due to a late core-formation in the cases 2 and 3,
and to a low accretion rate in the cases 6 and 7). As a conse-
quence, in the cases 2 and 6, the CV model did not enter yet
the swelling phase when we stopped the computation. In the

CVRD6

L. Haemmerl´e & T. Peters

cases 3 and 7, the computation ends soon after a local maxi-
mum of the radius, which could potentially be the maximum,
depending on the subsequent accretion episodes. For histo-
ries 4 and 5, the core forms at an early age (∼ 30 000 yr) and
the accretion rate is relatively high (∼ 5 × 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1),
so that the star can enter the high-mass range (M (cid:39) 20 M(cid:12)
at the end of the simulation). In these cases, the star follows
the whole pre-MS phase and reaches the ZAMS just before
the end of the simulation (in both CV and RD cases). In all
the six accretion histories, the CV model never reaches radii
higher than 50 R(cid:12), and the luminosity exceeds 104 L(cid:12) only
for Teﬀ > 10 000 K: the evolutionary tracks remain similar
to the case of low ˙M , with a star moving leftwards towards
the ZAMS.

In the RD case, the star reaches the end of the swelling
for all the accretion histories. As in the case of the accretion
history 1, the hot and compact initial model RD starts its
evolution with the swelling, while in the CV case the star
is still burning slowly its deuterium in the centre. As a con-
sequence, the swelling occurs at a younger age in the RD
case than in the CV case, and the maximum radius at the
end of the swelling in the RD case is above 50 R(cid:12) for all
the accretion histories, in contrast to the CV case. More-
over, the higher is the average accretion rate, the larger is
the maximum value of the radius. For histories 3, 4 and 5,
in which ˙M exceeds or approaches 5 × 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1, the
maximum radius of the RD model is even above 100 R(cid:12), as
for accretion history 1. (In histories 2, 6 and 7, we stay at
˙M (cid:46) 2 − 3 × 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1, and R < 100 R(cid:12).) In each of
these six cases, the RD evolutionary track shows a right-
wards turn during the swelling, leading the star to the red.
For histories 4 and 5, the luminosity approaches 104 L(cid:12) with
an eﬀective temperature as low as 4000−5000 K, due to this
turn, while the CV model reaches such luminosities only
when Teﬀ > 10 000 K. We notice that the models that reach
the ZAMS before the end of the simulation in the CV case
(histories 4 and 5) reach also the ZAMS in the RD case, and
vice versa.

3.1 Ionizing ﬂux

In order to evaluate the eﬀect of the stellar feedback on
the size of a surrounding H ii region, we ﬁrst compute the
number of ionizing photons per second by integrating the

The evolution of S∗ for the seven accretion histories
and the two initial models is shown on Fig. 5 to 11. In order
to understand the evolution of the ionizing ﬂux, we plot
also the accretion rate, the stellar radius and the eﬀective
temperature on the same ﬁgures. All these quantities are
shown as a function of the age. As mentioned in Sect. 2.4.1
and 2.4.2, for a given accretion history, the swelling does
not occur at the same age in the CV and RD cases, so that

radius, the eﬀective temperature and the ﬂux of ionizing photons

one has to be careful when comparing the evolution of S∗
between both cases. In particular, for accretion histories 2,
3, 6 and 7, in the CV case the star does not go through the
whole swelling and post-swelling phase before the end of the
simulation.

As mentioned in Sect. 2.4.1 and 2.4.2, in the CV case
the eﬀective temperature increases monotonically for all the
accretion histories considered. In terms of the ionizing ﬂux,
it results in a monotonous increase in S∗. Before the swelling,
it remains S∗ (cid:46) 1037 s−1, but when the swelling occurs, the
rapid increase in Teﬀ and L leads to a jump in S∗, by several
orders of magnitude. The jump is particularly abrupt for
accretion history 1: when the swelling becomes the stronger,
S∗ increases by two orders of magnitude in 100 years only. In
all the accretion histories for which the CV model reaches
the end of the swelling, S∗ exceeds 1040 s−1 at the end of
the swelling, except for accretion history 7. Then, during
the post-swelling contraction, it continues to increase more
slowly, by several orders of magnitude in typically 20 000
years, reaching S∗ (cid:39) 1048 s−1 on the ZAMS.

In contrast, as mentioned in Sect. 2.4.1 and 2.4.2, the

eﬀective temperature does not increase monotonically in the
RD case, and thus the behaviour of S∗ is much more com-
plex than in the CV case described above. In the beginning
of the simulations, which corresponds to the early swelling
phase in the RD case, the evolution of the ionizing ﬂux is
very sensitive to the evolution of the accretion rate. For ac-
cretion history 1, in which the swelling is strong already at
the very beginning of the simulation, the evolution starts
with a decreasing Teﬀ , and thus S∗ decreases slowly. The
swelling is still enhanced, the decrease in Teﬀ accelerates
and S∗ falls suddenly by one order of magnitude in less than
1000 years. Then the swelling slows down, the star starts to
contract again, and thus Teﬀ and S∗ can increase. Roughly
5000 years after its sudden fall, S∗ reaches again its previ-
ous value. The star contracts towards the ZAMS, which is
reached with the same S∗ (cid:39) 1048 s−1 as in the CV case.
For the other six accretion histories, the early behaviour
of S∗ is much richer, showing rapid oscillations: since the
swelling is initially weaker, the evolution of the eﬀective tem-
perature in the early stages depends more sensitively on the
variations of the accretion rate. In all these six cases, in the
beginning of the swelling, a lowering of the accretion rate is

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–16

responsible for a jump in the ionizing ﬂux: a sudden fall in ˙M
slows down the swelling, the eﬀective temperature increases
and thus S∗ shows a jump. For all these histories except
the 5, S∗ reaches a value as high as (cid:39) 1040 s−1 during this
event. It remains at such a high value during a timescale of
∼ 1000 years (500 years for accretion history 5, 10 000 years
for accretion history 7) Then the reverse eﬀect occurs: as the
accretion rate increases again, the swelling is enhanced, the
eﬀective temperature falls abruptly, and the ionizing ﬂux is
reduced. It happens for all the accretion histories from 2 to
7, but it is particularly noticeable for histories 3, 4, 5 and 7,
in which S∗ is reduced under its initial value. This decrease
occurs also on a timescale of ∼ 1000 years (1000 years for
accretion history 3, 4000 years for accretion history 4). Then
the swelling ends, Teﬀ starts to increase again and S∗ grows
slowly, as the star contracts towards the ZAMS. Again, the
timescale between the sudden fall and the slow increase in
S∗ is a few 1000 years (3000 years for accretion history 6,
5000 years for accretion history 3). When the star reaches
the ZAMS, its ionizing ﬂux is the same as in the CV case
(S∗ (cid:39) 1048 s−1, as mentioned above).

Figure 8. Same as Fig. 5 for accretion history 4.

We notice that for the three accretion histories that
lead to massive stars (1, 4 and 5), the main increase in the
ionizing ﬂux that occurs during the post-swelling contraction
is delayed by ∼ 10, 000 years in model CV compared to
model RD. This is a consequence of the shift in the age at
which the swelling occurs, as mentioned above. It suggests
that this shift produces also a similar delay in the expansion
of the H ii region.

3.2 Str¨omgren radius

We estimate the size of the H ii regions produced by the
ionizing feedbacks described in the previous section. We use
the Str¨omgren approximation, based on the assumption that
the number of ionizing photons emitted per second equals
the number of recombinations within the volume of the H ii
region (see e.g. Dyson & Williams 1997; Spitzer 1998). The
Str¨omgren radius is given by

ing to a gas temperature of ∼ 104 K. For the electron num-
ber density, we assume a constant value, but we consider
two diﬀerent cases: nel = 104 and 106 cm−3, corresponding
respectively to ultra-compact (UCHII) and hyper-compact
(HCHII) H ii regions (Kurtz 2005). With these assumptions,
we compute RS from the ionizing ﬂuxes S∗ described in the
previous section, using Eq. (6). When RS < R, we impose
RS = R.
The result is shown on Fig. 12 for the three accretion
histories leading to masses ∼ 20 M(cid:12). We used the luminosity
for the horizontal axis, in order to compare models with
3 log S∗ +
observational quantities. Eq. (6) gives log RS = 1
cst, so that on a logarithmic scale the curve of RS is simply
a re-scaling of the curve of S∗.
As we see, for these three accretion histories, the L− S∗
and L− RS relations diﬀer signiﬁcantly between the CV and
RD cases. In the CV case, due to the early monotonous
increase in Teﬀ , the ionizing ﬂux becomes rapidly high,
reaching S∗ (cid:38) 1040 s−1 as soon as log(L/L(cid:12)) (cid:38) 3.5, in all
three accretion histories. At this stage, the Str¨omgren radius
RS(UCHII) is already (cid:39) 30 [AU]. In contrast, in the RD case,

the decrease in Teﬀ during the strong swelling leads the ion-
izing ﬂux to values as low as S∗ ∼ 1035 − 1036 s−1 when the
bolometric luminosity is already log(L/L(cid:12)) (cid:39) 3.8. For such
a low value of S∗, we have RS(UCHII) (cid:39) 1 [AU] only. Due
to the strong swelling in the RD case, we have at this point
RS(UCHII) (cid:39) R, and hydrogen is ionized only in a relatively
thin shell around the star. For accretion history 1, the thick-
ness of this H ii shell remains as low as 0.5 [AU] during 5000
years. Then Teﬀ increases in both CV and RD cases, and
the models converge to RS(UCHII) (cid:39) 104 [AU] (cid:39) 0.05 [pc]
as they approach the ZAMS.

When we increase nel by two orders of magnitude, we
decrease RS by more than one order of magnitude (Eq. 6).
On the lower panel, the Str¨omgren radius is shown for nel =
106 cm−3 instead of nel = 104 cm−3. In this case, for the RD
model, at the maximum of the swelling the Str¨omgren radius
becomes smaller than the stellar radius (R (cid:39) 1 [AU]), i.e.

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–16

the H ii region disappears completely, ”engulfed” in the star.
This events lasts 10 000 years, until the stellar luminosity
reaches (cid:39) 104 L/L(cid:12). For the CV model, with its weaker
swelling, RS(HCHII) reached already nearly 100 [AU] at the
same luminosity. Then the contraction of the star leads to an
increase in Teﬀ , and RS(HCHII) reaches (cid:39) 1000 [AU] when
the star approaches the ZAMS, for both CV and RD models.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Magnitude of the swelling

The results of the previous sections show that, for a given
accretion history, the evolution of the star during the pre-
MS depends sensitively on the initial model. In particular,
the existence of a signiﬁcant swelling, that leads to radii
(cid:38) 100 R(cid:12) and brings back the star to the red, depends on

10

the initial entropy proﬁle. In each case, the hot, compact and
radiative model RD leads to signiﬁcantly higher radii than
the cold, extended and convective model CV. While the CV
tracks remain qualitatively similar to the classical tracks at
low ˙M , with the star moving leftwards, the RD tracks show
a rightwards turn during the swelling, leading the star to the
red, for each of the seven accretion histories.

Since the swelling is produced by the luminosity wave
(see Sect. 2.4.1), which corresponds to an internal redistribu-
tion of the entropy that restores thermal equilibrium, we ex-
pect the diﬀerence in the magnitude of the swelling between
the CV and the RD models to take its origin in the relative
eﬃciency of the various layers of the star to transport and
radiate their entropy. This is illustrated by the timescales for
the loss of entropy by radiation (i.e. the Kelvin-Helmholtz
time)

tKH =

GM 2
RL

(7)

and for the mass growth by accretion (i.e. the accretion time)

taccr =

M
˙M

(8)

These timescales are shown on Fig. 13 for the accretion his-
tory 1, for both CV and RD cases. (Since taccr depends only
on the accretion history, it is the same in both cases.) As we
see, in both cases, the evolution starts with tKH >> taccr.
In other words, the star ”accretes mass faster than it radi-
ates entropy”, and it has not the time to adjust thermally
to the newly accreted material, producing the swelling (i.e.
the increase in R produced by the increase in M dominates
over the decrease in R due to the decrease in s). In both
cases, the increase in R and L during the swelling reduces
tKH by several orders of magnitude, and brings it back under
taccr. Then the loss of entropy by radiation becomes eﬃcient
enough for the star to contract again, and the swelling ends.
By comparing tKH at the beginning of the simulation in
the CV and RD cases, we see that it is much longer in the
RD case than in the CV case, by two orders of magnitude,
due to the low R and L in the RD case. As a consequence,
the thermal adjustment by surface radiation is less eﬃcient

4.2 Initial model and early accretion geometry

As mentioned in Sect. 2.3, our two initial models can be seen
as models built by spherical (CV) and disc (RD) accretion.
The signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the evolution of the star and
the surrounding H ii region that we obtain between these
two cases suggest that a change in the accretion geometry
during the early accretion phase only, has a critical impact.
In the case of a purely disc geometry (RD case) we obtain
a strong swelling (R ∼ 100 R(cid:12)) for all the accretion his-
tories considered. In contrast, in the case of an accretion
geometry that is spherical in the early stages (i.e. in the
low-mass range M < 2 M(cid:12)) and then switched to a disc ge-
ometry for M > 2 M(cid:12) (CV case), the swelling remains weak
(R < 50 R(cid:12)) for all the accretion histories considered. The
physical reason of this behaviour is that spherical accretion
during the early accretion phase leads to high stellar lumi-
nosities at the end of this phase, allowing eﬃcient losses of
entropy. Then, disc accretion in the later phases lowers the
amount of entropy that is accreted by the star. Our results
indicate that the combination of these two eﬀects is able to
reduce drastically the magnitude of the swelling, with signif-
icant consequences on the evolution of the ionizing feedback
and the size of the surrounding H ii region. Interestingly,
we notice that this scenario of early spherical accretion and
later disc accretion is the more realistic, since the formation
of a disc in the accretion ﬂow is not instantaneous.

4.3 Comparison with other works

The pre-MS evolution of the models described above are in
good agreement with those of Haemmerl´e et al. (2016), ob-
tained with the same stellar code in the idealized case of a
constant accretion rate ( ˙M = 10−4 − 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1), with
the same assumption of cold disc accretion. With the more
realistic time-dependent accretion rates considered here,
that remain essentially in the same range, we obtain stel-
lar structures and evolutionary tracks that are qualitatively
similar to the case of a constant rate5. The key quantity
for a quantitative comparison is the maximum radius Rmax
reached during the swelling. In the CV case, Haemmerl´e
et al. (2016) obtained Rmax (cid:39) 20 R(cid:12) for ˙M = 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1,
and Rmax (cid:39) 40 R(cid:12) for
˙M = 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1. The value we
obtain with our time-dependent accretion rates are in the
same range. In the RD case, Haemmerl´e et al. (2016) ob-
tained Rmax (cid:39) 204 R(cid:12) for
˙M = 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1. With the
lower rates used here, we remain under this value. More-
over, in the models of Haemmerl´e et al. (2016), the value of
Rmax increases with ˙M , as in our case.

Hosokawa & Omukai (2009) and Hosokawa et al. (2010)
computed pre-MS models with accretion at constant rates,
based on both assumptions of spherical accretion and cold
disc accretion. In their ﬁducial cases, they considered ˙M =
10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1, which is slightly higher than the values we
use here, and they used initial models of (cid:39) 0.1 M(cid:12) that
were fully radiative, having thus an entropy proﬁle increas-
ing outwards. In their ﬁducial model for cold disc accretion
(Hosokawa et al. 2010), once the star reaches 2 M(cid:12) by ac-
cretion, its radius is 3.5 R(cid:12). By comparing this value with

5 We notice that the CV and RD initial models in Haemmerl´e
et al. (2016) are not exactly the same as those used here.

the black dotted lines is the accretion time M/ ˙M , given by the
accretion history.

in the RD case than in the CV case, so that the swelling is
stronger, leading to the rightwards turn on the HR diagram,
as described above. It explains also the fact that, the higher
is the accretion rate, the stronger is the swelling. Indeed, a
high accretion rate gives a short accretion time (Eq. 8), so
˙M , the more diﬃcult it is for the star to
that the higher is
adjust thermally to the mass increase.

As demonstrated in App. A, the global quantities such
as tKH do not allow to understand the eﬀect of a change
in the initial conﬁguration on the magnitude of the swelling
in all the cases. A detailed comparison between the initial
models would require to consider local quantities and the in-
ternal structures instead of only global quantities. However,
when we compare two extreme cases like the CV and the
RD models, we still expect tKH to be a relevant indicator to
express the ability of the star to restore thermal equilibrium,
provided that we consider its value before the swelling. Once
the swelling occurs, the contraction of the stellar interior is
highly non-homologous, and tKH is much less relevant. In
particular, we see on Fig. 13 that the swelling of the RD
model does not stop when tKH becomes shorter than in the
CV model, and that it continues even several thousand years
after tKH < taccr.

Finally, we notice that, since the swelling occurs earlier
for the RD model than for the CV one, the mass at which the
swelling starts is also lower and the accretion time shorter
in the RD case than in the CV case. Thus one could wonder
how this diﬀerence inﬂuences the results. In App. C, we show
that this eﬀect is negligible.

the radius of our two initial models (M = 2 M(cid:12), Sect. 2.3),
we see that the ﬁducial model of Hosokawa et al. (2010)
corresponds to an intermediate case between our CV and
RD cases, although it is much closer to the RD case than
to the CV case. When the swelling occurs, the stellar ra-
dius reaches Rmax (cid:39) 100 R(cid:12) in their model, which is also
an intermediate value between our CV and RD cases (resp.
44 R(cid:12) and 198 R(cid:12) for the accretion history 1). In the case
of spherical accretion, Hosokawa & Omukai (2009) reached
similar values for the maximum radius during the swelling.
It shows that the magnitude of the swelling does not change
critically when we use purely spherical accretion instead of
purely disc accretion. However, as explained in Sect. 4.2,
our results indicate that in the case of an accretion geom-
etry that is spherical in the early stages (low-mass range)
and disc-like in the later stages (intermediate- and high-
mass range), the magnitude of the swelling is signiﬁcantly
reduced. We notice that Hosokawa et al. (2010) computed
such models (labeled ”MD3-SDm1”). In this case, they ob-
tained only Rmax (cid:39) 50 R(cid:12) (see their Fig. 10), which is con-
sistent with our results.

Kuiper & Yorke (2013) computed pre-MS evolution
with more realistic accretion rates, by coupling their stel-
lar code with a hydrodynamic code for the accretion ﬂow,
and using the assumption of cold disc accretion. The time-
dependent accretion rates they obtained is again slightly
higher than in our case, with values of ∼ 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1.
In all their models, when the star reaches a mass of 2 M(cid:12),
its radius is (cid:39) 1 R(cid:12), which is smaller than our two initial
models, and than the models of Hosokawa et al. (2010) at
the same mass. Thus, it is not surprising that the maximum
radius reached during the swelling is much larger in their
models than in ours: in their run ”RHD+SE A”, the radius
reaches 885 R(cid:12), which is a factor ∼ 4 higher than in our case
(accretion history 1).

All these examples show that our results are in good
agreement with those of other authors, provided that we
compare models with the same physical conditions (initial
model, accretion rate and accretion geometry). Moreover, it
conﬁrms that the choice of the initial model (i.e. the early
accretion geometry) has critical consequences on the mag-
nitude of the swelling, and then on the ionizing eﬀect of the
stellar radiation: the more compact is the initial model, the
stronger are the swelling and the reduction of the number
of ionizing photons during the swelling. Indeed, all the mod-
els with disc accretion presented in Hosokawa et al. (2010)
and Kuiper & Yorke (2013) consider initial models that are
relatively compact (i.e. they model a star formed by disc
accretion since the very beginning of the accretion phase),
leading thus to a strong swelling, like in our RD models, in
contrast to our CV models that are initially more extended
and that have a much weaker swelling. In particular, all these
results suggest that a change in the accretion geometry in
the early accretion phase only (i.e. before the swelling, while
the star is still in the low-mass range), has a much stronger
impact than a global change: the compact initial models of
Kuiper & Yorke (2013) and our extended CV initial models
lead to values of Rmax that diﬀer by more than one order
of magnitude, despite the fact that they are based on the
same assumption of cold disc accretion during the swelling
phase; while in the models of Hosokawa & Omukai (2009)
and Hosokawa et al. (2010) that use various (but ﬁxed) ac-

cretion geometry during the whole accretion phase, the value
of Rmax remains in the same range.

Klassen et al. (2012b) estimated the evolution of the
ionizing ﬂux and of the size of an H ii region produced by
this ﬂux during the swelling, using the pre-computed stellar
models of Hosokawa & Omukai (2009), for spherical accre-
tion at constant rates (10−5 − 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1). As mentioned
above, these models are computed from compact radiative
initial models, similar to our RD models, and thus they ex-
perience a relatively strong swelling (Rmax (cid:39) 100 R(cid:12) in the
case ˙M = 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1). In this case, the eﬀective temper-
ature drops from 104 K to 6×103 K during the swelling, and
it results in a decrease in S∗ by 5 orders of magnitude in a
timescale of 3500 years. Such a decrease is consistent with
our RD model in the case of accretion history 4. But the as-
sumption of spherical accretion in the models of Hosokawa
& Omukai (2009) reﬂects in higher luminosities and eﬀec-
tive temperatures during the swelling than in our models.
As a consequence, the ionizing ﬂux is stronger in the models
of Hosokawa & Omukai (2009) than in ours, already before
the swelling. However, we notice that the typical magnitude
of the decrease in S∗, and more importantly the timescale
of this decrease, are similar in our case than in the case of
Klassen et al. (2012b).

4.4 Comparison with observations

Mottram et al. (2011) have obtained luminosity functions of
massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) and compact H ii
regions for the Red MSX Source (RMS) survey. They ﬁnd
a lack of high-luminosity MYSOs and speculate that these
MYSOs may be too cool to ionize their surroundings because
they are undergoing a swelling phase due to high accretion
rates. However, the drop in eﬀective temperature during the
swelling is in general a relatively short-lived phase compared
to the persistently lower eﬀective temperatures in our CV
models, as it is visible on Fig. 5 to 11. This suggests that
convective initial conditions during high-mass pre-MS evolu-
tion may be a more compelling solution to the discrepancy,
but we leave a more thorough analysis for future work.

5 CONCLUSIONS

computed pre-MS tracks

We have
for massive and
intermediate-mass stars with variable accretion rates, using
the assumption of cold disc accretion. We have started our
models from two diﬀerent initial conditions (at M = 2 M(cid:12)):
the fully convective model CV and the fully radiative model
RD, that can be seen respectively as the product of spherical
and disc accretion in the early phase (i.e. in the low-mass
range M < 2 M(cid:12)).

We ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the two cases
for the evolution of the stellar radius and the ionizing lu-
minosity. In general, the CV case shows a much weaker
swelling of the protostar for high accretion rates than the
RD case. It indicates that in the case of an accretion geome-
try that is spherical in the early accretion phase (before the
swelling) and disc-like in the later accretion phase (during
the swelling), the magnitude of the swelling is drastically re-
duced compared to the case of a purely disc geometry, with

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–16

signiﬁcant impact on the ionizing feedback of the star and
the size of the surrounding H ii region. The stellar structure
in case RD is very sensitive to the accretion rate and reacts
quickly to accretion bursts, which can lead to considerable
changes in stellar radius, eﬀective temperature and ionizing
luminosity on timescales as short as 100 – 1000 yr. In con-
trast, the evolution in case CV is much less inﬂuenced by the
instantaneous accretion rate, and always produces a mono-
tonically increasing ionizing photon ﬂux that can be many
orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding ﬂux in
case RD. For massive stars, this diﬀerence in the ionizing
ﬂux results in a delay of the H ii region expansion by up
to 10,000 yr. While in the CV case the radius of the H ii
region is already 100 – 1000 AU when the stellar luminosity
reaches 104 L(cid:12), in the RD case it remains as low as 1 AU
at such high luminosities. This last value is similar to the
stellar radius itself in this case, due to the strong swelling, so
that the H ii region disappears nearly or completely, which
never happens in the CV case.

We conclude that the choice of the initial protostellar
model (i.e. of the early accretion geometry) has a large im-
pact on the strength of the radiative feedback in general,
and the ionizing luminosity in particular, during the pre-
MS evolution of massive protostars, with signiﬁcant conse-
quences on the size of H ii regions around them. This eﬀect
is much larger than the diﬀerence between purely spheri-
cal and purely disc accretion, and introduces an important
uncertainty that should be taken into account in models
of high-mass star formation. Interestingly, because of their
lower eﬀective temperatures, our CV models may hint at a
solution to an observed discrepancy between the luminosity
distribution functions of MYSOs and compact H ii regions.

APPENDIX A: INITIAL SIZE OF THE
RADIATIVE CORE AND MAGNITUDE OF
THE SWELLING

The models described above were computed using two ini-
tial models, CV and RD, being respectively fully convective
and fully radiative (see Sect. 2.3). In the present appendix,
we consider several intermediate initial models and we look
at the evolutionary tracks obtained from these initial con-
ditions in the simpliﬁed case of a constant accretion rate of
10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1. We use seven initial models that diﬀer from
each other in their total radii as well as their internal struc-
ture: three of them are fully convective, three are made of a
radiative core and a convective envelope, and the last one is
fully radiative. Table A1 gives the values of the total radii
Rini and the radii rrad of their radiative core as a percentage
of Rini. It shows also the maximum radius Rmax reached dur-
ing the swelling. The value of Rmax as a function of Rini is
shown on Fig. A1, and as a function of rrad/Rini on Fig. A2.
Notice that the two extreme models correspond to our CV
and RD models.

As we see, the value of Rmax for the most compact mod-
els, which are not fully convective, is much larger than for
the extended fully convective models. However, we notice
that the relation between Rmax and Rini is not monotonic.
Indeed, by comparing the three models that are initially
fully convective, we see that a strong decrease in Rini, from
20.4 to 6 R(cid:12), reduces slightly the value of Rmax. But for the

models that have initially a radiative core, even a modest
decrease in Rini, from 4.6 to 2.5 R(cid:12), leads to a spectacular
increase of Rmax. By comparing the two models that are
the more compact, we even see that in this case the one
with a slightly higher Rini (namely the RD model) leads
to a much larger Rmax. If we look instead at the relation
between Rmax and rrad/Rini, we see that the correlation is
much more straightforward: the value of Rmax changes only
slightly between the models that have rrad = 0, despite the
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between their total radii, and it starts
to increase signiﬁcantly only when rrad increases too. This

result indicates that the signiﬁcant quantity that determines
the magnitude of the swelling is not the stellar radius, but
the size of the radiative core.

APPENDIX B: IMPACT OF DEUTERIUM
SHELL-BURNING ON THE SWELLING

As mentioned in Sect. 2.4.1, the entropy release that pro-
duces the swelling comes from both gravitational contrac-
tion and deuterium shell-burning. In order to evaluate the
relative contribution of these two entropy sources, we recon-
sider here the cases that lead to the strongest swelling (i.e.
accretion histories 1, 4 and 5, with the RD initial model),
using this time X2 = 0, i.e. without including any deuterium
in the accreted material. The resulting evolutionary tracks
are plotted on Figs. B1, B2 and B3 (red dotted tracks) to-
gether with the evolutionary tracks of the equivalent models
that include deuterium, already described in Sect. 2.4.

The eﬀect of deuterium shell-burning is visible by com-
paring the red and the blue tracks on the three plots. As
we see, the relative importance of D-burning depends sensi-
tively on the accretion history. For accretion histories 1 and
5, removing the deuterium in the accreted material reduces
signiﬁcantly the magnitude of the swelling. Without deu-
terium, the maximum radius reached during the swelling is
similar to the CV case with deuterium (Rmax (cid:39) 50 R(cid:12)). In
contrast, for accretion history 4, the impact of D-burning
on the magnitude of the swelling is negligible: the red
and blue curves nearly overlap. We notice that for accre-
tion histories 1 and 5, the accretion rate reaches values

> 5 × 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1 in the very beginning of the swelling,
before decreasing slowly, while for accretion history 4 such
values are reached later, once the swelling is already signiﬁ-
cant. It suggests that the eﬀect of D shell-burning dominates
when a star having an RD structure accretes at a high rate
(∼ 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1). But when the accretion rate on such a
star is low (∼ 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1), D-burning plays a negligible
role, even if the rate grows once the swelling is already sig-
niﬁcant.

Since the initial model RD is built without including

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–16

CVRDCVRDCVRDany deuterium (because of its high internal temperature, see
Sect. 2.3), the eﬀect of D-burning in the models computed
from it is only due to the deuterium that is accreted during
the evolution. Thus one can wonder if this eﬀect is real or
artiﬁcial, due to the addition of D in a model that did not
contain initially such a chemical species, and to the sudden
triggering of its combustion. Indeed, a comprehensive an-
swer to this issue would require to start the computations
at lower masses, when the internal temperature is still too
low for the burning of deuterium, and to follow consistently
its destruction. Unfortunately, such computations are cur-
rently problematic with the Geneva code, due to diﬃculties
in the convergence process at low masses when we include
accretion. Nevertheless, we were able to compute one model
starting from a mass of 0.3 M(cid:12), accreting at a high constant
rate of 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1 (let us call this model ini03). When
this model reaches M = 2 M(cid:12), its internal structure and sur-
face properties correspond to an intermediate case between
our CV and RD models. If we build such an intermediate
model (let us call it RC6) in the same way as we built the
RD model, we obtain a central temperature of 4 × 106 K,
which is still much higher than the temperature required for
signiﬁcant D-burning, and we have to take X2 = 0 in the
whole star, like in the RD case. Then we can compute the
evolution starting from RC, at the same constant accretion
rate of 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1, in both cases with and without deu-
terium in the accreted material, and compare it with the
evolution of ini03.

The evolutionary tracks of these models are shown on
Fig. B4. As we see, the blue track reproduces well the black
one, i.e. the RC initial model leads to a pre-MS evolution
which is similar to a model computed from a lower initial
mass, in which we follow consistently the whole D-burning
phase. In contrast, the red track diverges quickly from the
other two, showing that in this case the deuterium shell-
burning plays the dominant role in the swelling.

This example conﬁrms on one hand the importance of
D-burning, but it shows on the other hand that the eﬀect
of D-burning is well reproduced with the initial model RC,
despite the fact that this initial model does not contain any
deuterium. We conclude that the impact of D-burning on the
magnitude of the swelling is dominated by the burning of the
accreted deuterium. Even if some deuterium survives to the
early accretion phase (M < 2 M(cid:12)), it plays a negligible role
in the subsequent evolution.

APPENDIX C: IMPACT OF INITIAL
CONDITIONS ON THE SWELLING IN THE
CASE OF A CONSTANT ACCRETION
TIMESCALE

In Sect. 4.1, we interpret the dependence of the magnitude
of the swelling on the initial conditions by comparing the
Kelvin-Helmholtz time of our initial models. However, we
notice that the mass at which the swelling occurs depends
also on the initial conditions, so that the accretion timescale
at the beginning of the swelling diﬀers between the CV and

rial, and the red dotted line is the RC model without deuterium.

the RD cases. In order to evaluate how this feature inﬂuences
our results, we compute models starting from the same CV
˙M ∝
and RD initial models, but using an accretion rate
M , for which taccr is constant. We take taccr = 104 yr, i.e.
˙M = M/104 yr. This rate has the same order of magnitude
as the time-variable rates used in Sect. 2.4, running from
10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1 for M = 1 M(cid:12) to 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1 for M =
10 M(cid:12).

The evolution of the timescales and the radii of these
models is shown on Fig. C1. As for the models described
in Sect. 2.4 and 4.1, the evolution starts with tKH(RD) >>
tKH(CV) >> taccr. In the RD case, the swelling starts since
the beginning of the evolution (M = 2 M(cid:12)), tKH decreases,
becomes rapidly shorter than taccr, and the radius exceeds
100 R(cid:12), reaching Rmax = 234 R(cid:12). In contrast, the CV model
starts its evolution by the slow central D-burning phase, and
the swelling occurs only at a mass of (cid:39) 10 M(cid:12). But despite
the fact that the accretion timescale remains constant, the
swelling is still much weaker than in the RD case, leading to
a maximum radius of 48 R(cid:12) only.

We conclude that the increase in the accretion timescale
with the mass in the models described in Sect. 2.4 and 4.1
is not responsible for the diﬀerence in the magnitude of the
swelling between the CV and the RD cases.
