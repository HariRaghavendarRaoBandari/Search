The phenomenon of inverse magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry in QCD predicted by

lattice simulations can be reproduced within the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model if the coupling

G of the model decreases with the strength B of the magnetic ﬁeld and temperature T . The

thermo-magnetic dependence of G(B, T ) is obtained by ﬁtting recent lattice QCD predictions

for the chiral transition order parameter. Diﬀerent thermodynamic quantities of magnetized

quark matter evaluated with a G(B, T ) are compared with the ones obtained at constant

coupling G. The model with a G(B, T ) predicts a more dramatic chiral transition as the ﬁeld

intensity increases. In addition, the pressure and magnetization always increase with B for

a given temperature. Being parametrized by four magnetic ﬁeld dependent coeﬃcients and

having a rather simple exponential thermal dependence our accurate ansatz for the running

coupling can be easily implemented to improve typical model applications to magnetized

quark matter.

eﬀects of a magnetic ﬁeld in deﬁning the boundaries of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase

diagram — for recent reviews, see Refs. [4, 5]. In both situations, the magnitude of the magnetic
ﬁelds is huge and may reach about ∼ 1019 G and ∼ 1018 G in each case respectively. In the case
of heavy ion collisions, the presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld most certainly plays a role despite

the fact that, in principle, the ﬁeld intensity should decrease very rapidly lasting for about 1-2

fm/c only [1, 2]. The possibility that this short time interval may [6] or may not [7] be aﬀected by

conductivity remains under dispute. At zero temperature, the great majority of eﬀective models

for QCD are in agreement with respect to the occurrence of the phenomenon of magnetic catalysis

(MC), which refers to the increase of the chiral order parameter represented by the (light) quark

condensates with the strenght B of the magnetic ﬁeld. On the other hand, at ﬁnite temperature

such models fail to predict the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC), an eﬀect discovered by lattice

QCD (LQCD) simulations [8, 9], in that the pseudo-critical temperature Tpc for chiral symmetry

restoration decreases as B increases. This failure has motivated a large body of work attempting

to clarify the reasons for the observed discrepancy [4, 5, 10–51].

Intuitively, it is natural to

attribute the failure to the fact that most eﬀective models lack gluonic degrees of freedom and

so are unable to account for the back reaction of sea quarks to the external magnetic ﬁeld. This

implies, in particular, the absence of the asymptotic freedom (AF), a key feature of QCD that

plays an important role in processes involving high temperatures and large baryon densities, and,

of course, large magnetic ﬁelds. Since long ago, AF eﬀects in eﬀective models has been mimicked by

making the coupling strength to decrease with the temperature and/or density according to some

ansatz [52, 53]. More recently, this very same strategy was adopted in the case of hot magnetized

quark matter. In particular, in Ref. [54], the IMC phenomenon found by lattice simulations was

explained within the two-ﬂavor Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model (NJL) if the coupling constant, G,

decreases with both the magnetic ﬁeld strength and the temperature, simulating the eﬀect of AF

in QCD. A similar mechanism was used with a SU (3) Polyakov-NJL (PNJL) model, but with G

depending only on the magnetic ﬁeld [55] which, however, leads to results in contradiction with

lattice results, in that it leads to a non monotonic decrease of Tpc at high ﬁeld values. In a very

recent work [45], an explicit calculation of the one-loop correction to the quark-gluon vertex has

shown that competing eﬀects between gluon and quark color charges, as in the phenomenon of

asymptotic freedom, lead to the decrease of eﬀective quark-gluon coupling with the magnetic ﬁeld

at ﬁnite temperatures. This certainly lends strong support to the idea [54] that the IMC is due to

the decrease of the eﬀective coupling between quarks and gluons in the presence of magnetic ﬁelds

at high temperatures.

3

In the present paper we investigate the implications of using a B and T modiﬁed NJL coupling

for thermodynamic quantities of magnetized quark matter. We are particularly interested in the

qualitative changes that a G(B, T ) causes in quantities very sensitive to the chiral transition, such

as the speed of sound, thermal susceptibility and speciﬁc heat. This is an important open question

since the interaction that is implied by a G(B, T ) gives rise to a new phenomenology that has not

been fully explored. Initially we quantitatively reﬁne the running of the coupling G(B, T ), proposed

in Ref. [54], by accurately ﬁtting results from recent LQCD calculations. We ﬁt the LQCD results

for the magnetized quark condensates with a simple formula for G(B, T ) which is parametrized

by four B-dependent coeﬃcients. As we shall demonstrate, one of the main physical implications

of using a G(B, T ) is that the signatures associated with the chiral transition in thermodynamic

quantities become more markedly deﬁned as the ﬁeld strength increases. Also, our results for

the pressure and magnetization are in line with LQCD predictions, which ﬁnd that at a ﬁxed

temperature, these quantities always raise with B. This behavior, especially close to the transition

region, is not observed with the NJL model with a B and T independent coupling G.

In the next section we review the results for the magnetized thermodynamical NJL potential

within the mean ﬁeld approximation (MFA). In Sec. III we extract a G(B, T ) from an accurate

ﬁt of LQCD results. Numerical results for diﬀerent thermodynamical quantities are presented in

Sec. IV. Our conclusions and ﬁnal remarks are presented in Sec. V.

II. MAGNETIZED NJL PRESSURE

Here we consider the isospin-symmetric two ﬂavor version of the NJL model [56], deﬁned by

the Lagrangian density

LNJL = ¯ψ(cid:0) /D − m(cid:1) ψ + G(cid:2)( ¯ψψ)2 + ( ¯ψiγ5(cid:126)τ ψ)2(cid:3) − 1

F µνFµν ,

(2.1)

where the ﬁeld ψ represents a ﬂavor iso-doublet of u and d quark ﬂavors and Nc-plet of quark ﬁelds,
(cid:126)τ are the isospin Pauli matrices, Dµ = (i∂µ−QAµ) the covariant derivative, Q=diag(qu= 2e/3, qd=-
e/3) the charge matrix and Aµ, F µν = ∂µAν −∂νAµ are respectively the electromagnetic gauge and
tensor ﬁelds1. Since the model is non-renormalizable, we need to specify a regularization scheme.

In this work we use a noncovariant cutoﬀ, Λ, within the magnetic ﬁeld independent regularization

scheme (MFIR). The MFIR scheme, originally formulated in terms of the proper-time regularization

method [58], was recently reformulated [57] using the dimensional regularization prescription in

QCD by performing a sum over all Landau levels in the vacuum term. In this way, one is able to

isolate the divergencies into a term that has the form of the zero magnetic ﬁeld vacuum energy

and thereby can be renormalized in the standard fashion. The MFIR was recently employed in

the problems of magnetized color superconducting cold matter [59, 60], where its advantages, such

as the avoidance of unphysical oscillations, are fully discussed. Within this regularization scheme,

the cutoﬀ Λ, the coupling G and the current quark mass m represent free parameters which are

ﬁxed [61, 62] by ﬁtting the values of the pion mass mπ, pion decay constant fπ and quark condensate
(cid:104) ¯ψf ψf(cid:105).

When the MFA is adopted the NJL pressure in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld can be expressed

as a sum of quasi-particle and condensate contributions [57, 64]:

Notice that although the quark condensate for the ﬂavors u and d in the presence of a magnetic

ﬁeld are diﬀerent due to their diﬀerent electric charges, the masses of the u and d constituent

quarks are equal to each other since we work here in isospin-symmetric limit, mu = md = m—for

details, see Ref. [64]. Finally note that the term B2/2 in Eq. (2.2), which arises from the pho-

ton propagator, does not contribute to the normalized pressure when this quantity is deﬁned as
PN (T, B) = P (T, B) − P (0, B) like in the present work (see Ref. [57] for further details).

At vanishing densities, the energy density  is deﬁned as  = −PN + T s where s is the entropy
density, s = ∂PN /∂T . Other thermodynamical observables such as the interaction measure, ∆,
s, and the magnetization, M, which contain valuable
the speciﬁc heat, cv, the velocity of sound, c2
information on the role played by the magnetic ﬁeld on the onset of chiral transition, will also be

investigated here. They are deﬁned as follows

III. THERMO-MAGNETIC NJL COUPLING

We start describing the ﬁtting procedure used to obtain the thermo-magnetic dependence of

the NJL coupling constant. Our strategy is to reproduce with the model the lattice results of

Ref. [9] for the quark condensate average, (Σu + Σd)/2.

In the lattice calculation, the conden-

sates are normalized in a way which is reminiscent of Gell-Mann–Oakes–Renner relation (GOR),

πf 2

π

(3.1)

with (cid:104) ¯ψf ψf(cid:105)00 representing the quark condensates at T = 0 and B = 0. In order to ﬁt the lattice
results, the other physical quantities appearing in Eq. (3.1) should be those of Ref. [9]; namely,

6

mπ = 135 MeV, fπ = 86 MeV, and m = 5.5 MeV so that, by invoking the GOR relation, one can
use the LQCD value (cid:104) ¯ψf ψf(cid:105)1/3
00 = −230.55 MeV. Therefore, as far as Eq. (3.1) is concerned, only
(cid:104) ¯ψf ψf(cid:105)BT is to be evaluated with the NJL model. As we show below, the NJL predictions for the in
vacuum scalar condensate are numerically very close to those obtained with the LQCD simulations
so that the above value for (cid:104) ¯ψf ψf(cid:105)00 can be safely used in Eq. (3.1) without introducing important
uncertainties.

The LQCD results of Ref. [9] were obtained at T = 0 and at high T , with no data points between

T = 0 and T = 113 MeV. Therefore, recalling that the discrepancies between lattice results

and eﬀective models appear in the region where chiral symmetry is partially restored (crossover),

it seems therefore reasonable to ﬁt the NJL coupling constant within this region and then to

extrapolate the results to zero temperature if needed.

A good ﬁnite temperature ﬁt to the lattice data for the average (Σu + Σd)/2 can be obtained

by using the following interpolation formula for NJL coupling constant:

(cid:20)

1 −

1 + eβ(B)[Ta(B)−T ]

(cid:21)

G(B, T ) = c(B)

+ s(B).

(3.2)

Note that the parameters c, s, β and Ta depend only on the magnetic ﬁeld; their values are shown

in Table I. Remark also that Eq. (3.2) does not necessarily require the knowledge of G(0, 0), but

one still needs Λ and m which in this work are taken at standard values, Λ = 0.650 GeV and

m = 5.5 MeV.

Figures 1 and 2 display the results for combinations of the quark condensates: the u and

In the left panels of the ﬁgures, the condensates are
evaluated with a T− and B−independent coupling G that ﬁts the lattice result for the average
(Σu + Σd)/2 in vacuum, G = 4.50373 GeV−2; in the right panels, the condensates are calculated
with the coupling G(B, T ) of Eq. (3.2), with the ﬁtting parameters given in Table I.

Figure 1: Quark condensates for ﬂavors u and d as functions of temperature for diﬀerent values of the

magnetic ﬁeld for G (left) and G(B, T ) (right).

The ﬁgures clearly show that the NJL model is able to capture the sharp decrease around the

crossover temperature of the lattice results for the average and diﬀerence of the condensates only
when the coupling G(B, T ) is used; when using the T− and B−independent coupling G, a rather
smooth behavior for these quantities is obtained. We have not attempted to obtain a G(B, T ) that
gives a best ﬁt for both (Σu + Σd)/2 and Σu − Σd, but one sees that the model nevertheless gives
a very reasonable description of the latter. Although here we are not particularly concerned with

the results at T = 0, for the sake of completeness we mention that an extrapolation of the ﬁt to
T = B = 0 gives G(0, 0) = 4.6311 GeV−2. Such a coupling leads to (cid:104) ¯ψf ψf(cid:105)1/3
00 = −236.374 MeV,
which diﬀers only by a few percent from the value calculated with G. This small discrepancy is

due to the fact that we have attempted to obtain a good ﬁt with a limited number of parameters

of the lattice data at high temperatures only, where more data are available.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR THERMODYNAMICAL QUANTITIES

Let us start examining the consequences for the thermodynamics of the model when using the

coupling constant G(B, T ). We start by considering the quantities that characterize the EoS, such
as the normalized pressure PN , the entropy density s, the energy density E, and the EoS parameter
PN /E. These quantities are displayed in Figures 3 and 4 for the T− and B−independent G and
G(B, T ) couplings. First of all, one observes that G(B, T ) always predicts larger values for PN ,
s, and E for a given temperature as the ﬁeld strength increases as compared to the corresponding
values obtained with a T− and B−independent coupling G. Moreover, qualitatively diﬀerent T
dependences at high and low T ’s are seen: for example, at low temperatures, one observes that

PN decreases monotonically with B, while it increases monotonically at high temperatures. At
intermediate values of temperatures, T ≈ 200 MeV, even an oscillation around the B = 0 curve
is observed. The G(B, T ) coupling also predicts a more dramatic increase of the pressure around

the chiral crossover; at eB = 0.8 GeV2, the pressure predicted with G(B, T ) is about twice the

value at B = 0, while the departure from the B = 0 curve is more modest in the case when G is

considered.

The thermodynamical observables predicted with G(B, T ) can be compared with recent lattice

results[66]. For example, the systematic increase of PN with B is clearly observed in Fig. 5 of Ref.

[66], the behavior of PN / seen in Fig. 7 of the same reference is similar to the one found in Fig. 3

and Fig. 4 of the present paper. Although the lattice calculations of [66] are for 2 + 1 ﬂavors QCD

a qualitative agreement can clearly be noticed. Here, we emphasize that the results with ﬁxed G

presents a clear discrepancy with the ones obtained within the LQCD simulations of Ref. [66].

an overall enhancement of all quantities in the transition region for strong magnetic ﬁelds while

the Stefan-Boltzmann limit is approached as the temperature increases.

The results clearly indicate that the thermal susceptibility changes dramatically when G is

replaced by G(B, T ). In particular, one notices in Fig. 6 that ∆ presents peaks that move in the

direction of low temperatures when B increases in accordance with Ref. [66].

the remaining derivatives are easily calculated.

In Fig. 8 we show the normalized magnetization M/e as a function of the temperature for

diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths.

values of the magnetic ﬁeld strength obtained with G (left) and G(B, T ) (right).

Again, one observes that G does not predict a monotonic increase of the magnetization with

B for a given temperature. This can be more clearly observed in Fig. 9 where we show how the

magnetization varies with B for temperatures T = 180 MeV and T = 200 MeV which are close to

Tpc.

One sees that G(B, T ) predicts a steady increase which seems to agree with the Nf = 2+1 LQCD

simulations of Ref. [66] while the naive G predicts that the magnetization reaches a maximum at
eB ≈ 0.6 GeV2 for T = 180 MeV, and at eB ≈ 0.4 GeV2 for T = 200 MeV.

We close this section by remarking that, to the best of our knowledge, LQCD predictions for the

Nf = 2 case analyzed here are not available in the literature. Then, one could argue that the use of

the three ﬂavor version of the NJL model, which is tailormade to account for strangeness, would be

more appropriate as far as numerical comparisons are concerned. In our opinion this is a legitimate

concern and we also agree that the Nf = 2 + 1 version is the one to be adopted in situations such as

realistic astrophysical applications, where strangeness is important, or comparisons aiming to be

in quantitative agreement with LQCD predictions for thermodynamical observables. Nevertheless,

we recall that our ansatz for the four-fermion vertex, G, was obtained by ﬁtting the LQCD results

for the light quark sector which represents the relevant degrees of freedom regarding the chiral

transition. As we have shown in the present section using this ansatz one retrieves, at least

qualitatively, most lattice predictions for diﬀerent thermodynamical quantities for the Nf = 2 + 1

case improving over predictions made with a ﬁxed coupling. In principle this encouraging result

can be further generalized to furnish numerical results which agree quantitatively with the in silico

simulations for three ﬂavors. Remark that the more sophisticated SU (3) NJL model possesses a

six-fermion vertex characterized by another coupling (K) which can also be considered to have a

thermo-magnetic dependence. Then, using this extra degree of freedom one could attempt to give

a numerically more accurate description of the LQCD for Nf = 2 + 1 as a (consistent) alternative

to the simple approach adopted in Ref. [55] where the authors consider solely the coupling G, only

with a magnetic dependence, to describe all channels. We postpone this investigation to a future

work.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Aiming to capture some aspects of QCD’s asymptotic freedom phenomenon we have investigated

the thermodynamics of hot and magnetized quark matter within the NJL model using a coupling

which runs with both the temperature and the magnetic ﬁeld strength. By ﬁtting the LQCD results

for the quark condensates we were able to obtain a numerically accurate ansatz for the resulting

coupling, G(B, T ), which was further employed to compute diﬀerent thermodynamical quantities

used to describe the chiral transition. Therefore, the present application considerably extends and

improves a previous work [54] whose major goal was to reproduce the high-T IMC phenomenon

16

from a qualitaive point of view.

Our numerical results allows us to conclude that the use a coupling mimicking AF alters sig-

niﬁcantly the behavior of the EoS with respect to predictions performed with the standard ﬁxed

coupling. For instance, for any ﬁxed temperature, quantities such as the pressure and the magneti-

zation obtained with our G(B, T ) always increase with B, a result which appears to be consistent

with LQCD predictions [66]. Another feature which gives further support to the use of G(B, T ) is

the observation that in this case the chiral transition appears to happen in a more dramatic fash-

ion and the peaks of quantities such as the entropy density increase considerably with B which,

once again, is an outcome characteristic of LQCD simulations often missed within standard NJL

applications.

In summary we have shown that the NJL model can be patched in order to accurately reproduce

IMC which is observed to take within the chiral transition of hot and magnetized quark matter.

In particular, our Eq. (3.2) represents an ansatz for G(B, T ) which can be promptly implemented

to improve NJL model applications.

Finally, we point out that the non monotonic decrease of Tpc at eB ≈ 1.1 GeV2 values observed
[55] where G was taken to depend on B only is perhaps due to the fact that the correct

in Ref.

running was not properly taken into account since within QCD the temperature also represents

an energy scale and the coupling constant still runs with T when B = 0. So, in principle, purely

thermal eﬀects should also inﬂuence this parameter as well as the six-fermion coupling, K, whose

running has been neglected in Ref. [55]. However, in practice, with few exceptions [52, 53], purely

thermal eﬀects are usually neglected since no qualitative discrepancies between LQCD and model
predictions have been observed so far when T (cid:54)= 0 and B = 0 in contrast to the case when B is
also present. Indeed, our results show that to have a consistent monotonic decrease of Tpc with B
it is crucial to consider a B − T dependent coupling which seems to be consistent with the ﬁndings
of Ref. [19] where the authors argue that chiral models with couplings depending solely on B are

unable to correctly describe IMC. Also, in Ref.

[68] IMC is observed when a thermo-magnetic

eﬀective coupling appears as a consequence of improving a mean ﬁeld evaluation with mesonic

eﬀects.
