Abstract

Recent work by Webb et al. has provided indications of spatial variations of the ﬁne-structure
constant, α, at a level of a few parts per million. Using a dataset of 293 archival measurements,
they further show that a dipole provides a statistically good ﬁt to the data, a result subsequently
conﬁrmed by other authors. Here we show that a more recent dataset of dedicated measure-
ments further constrains these variations: although there are only 10 such measurements, their
uncertainties are considerably smaller. We ﬁnd that a dipolar variation is still a good ﬁt to the
combined dataset, but the amplitude of such a dipole must be somewhat smaller: 8.1 ± 1.7 ppm
for the full dataset, versus 9.4 ± 2.2 ppm for the Webb et al. data alone, both at the 68.3%
conﬁdence level. Constraints on the direction on the sky of such a dipole are also signiﬁcantly
improved. On the other hand the data can’t yet discriminate between a pure spatial dipole and
one with an additional redshift dependence.

1. Introduction

Testing the stability of nature’s fundamental couplings is among the most actively pursued
topics in observational astrophysics [1]. In addition to the intrinsically fundamental nature of
these tests, the measurements (whether they are detections of variations or null results) have
deep consequences for cosmology and fundamental physics, an overview of which is provided
in [2].

A recent analysis by Webb et al. of a large archival dataset has provided some evidence
for spatial variations of the ﬁne-structure constant, α, at the level of a few parts per million
(ppm) [3, 4]. The dataset includes a total of 293 measurements in the approximate redshift
range 0.2 < z. < 4.2, obtained with ESO’s UVES spectrograph at the VLT and with the HIRES
spectrograph at the Keck telescope. Both the analysis of Webb et al. and those of subsequent

works [5, 6, 7, 8] ﬁnd evidence for a spatial dipole in the measurements, at a statistical level of
signiﬁcance of more than four standard deviations.

Meanwhile some dedicated measurements of α (that is, those where the data was speciﬁcally
taken for this purpose) has been obtained and further eﬀorts in this direction are ongoing, such
as those of the UVES Large Program for Testing Fundamental Physics [9, 10]. The number
of currently available dedicated measurements is only a dozen or so, so they can’t yet be used
on their own to search for spatial variations. Nevertheless, these measurements have statistical
and systematic uncertainties that are nominally smaller than those of the archival measurements.
(Note that in a large sample such as that of Webb et al. the systematic uncertainties can be—
and have been—estimated directly from the sample distribution, while this is not possible for
individual measurements.) Here, therefore, we carry out a ﬁrst joint analysis of the Webb et al.
and the more recent measurements, with the aim of ascertaining whether the evidence for the
dipolar variation is preserved.

2. Available data and parameterizations

Previous studies of the spatial distribution of α measurements were restricted to the data of
Webb et al. [3], which is a large dataset of archival data measurements. This dataset has been
extensively described elsewhere (most notably in [4]), and we refer the reader to these works
for additional details. There have been recent suggestions that the level of systematics in these
measurements may have been underestimated [11], but here we simply take the published values
at face value, and calculate the total uncertainty for each measurement by adding in quadrature
the statistical and systematic uncertainties.

In our analysis we will also consider this data on its own (to check that we recover previously
published results) but, more importantly, we will for the ﬁrst time combine it with the available,
smaller and more recent, dataset of dedicated measurements listed in Table 1. This compilation
includes the early results of the UVES Large Program for Testing Fundamental Physics [9, 10],
which is expected to be the one with a better control of possible systematics. The source of the
data in this Table is also further discussed in [12].

We note that the ﬁrst measurement listed on the table is the weighted average from measure-
ments in 8 absorption systems in the redshift range 0.73 < z < 1.53 along lines of sight that
are widely separated on the sky (HE1104-1805A, HS1700+6416 and HS1946+7658) [13]; the
authors only report this average and not the individual measurements. For this reason we listed
the result in Table 1 for completeness but naturally it won’t be included in our analysis. Our
more recent dataset therefore has 10 diﬀerent measurements, all in the redshift range 1 < z < 2.
We will ﬁt this data to two diﬀerent phenomenological parameterizations. The ﬁrst is a pure

spatial dipole for the relative variation of α

which depends on the orthodromic distance Ψ to the north pole of the dipole (the locus of maxi-

with (θi, φi) being the Declination and Right Ascension of the i-th measurement and (θ0, φ0) those
of the north pole. These latter two coordinates, together with the overall amplitude A, are our free

Table 1: Recent dedicated measurements of α. Listed are, respectively, the object along each line of sight, the redshift of
the measurement, the measurement itself (in parts per million), the spectrograph(s), and the original reference. The recent
UVES Large Program measurements are [9, 10]. The quoted errors include both statistical and systematic uncertainties
(to the extent that these were estimated in the original works), added in quadrature. The ﬁrst measurement is the weighted
average from 8 absorbers in the redshift range 0.73 < z < 1.53 along the lines of sight of HE1104-1805A, HS1700+6416
and HS1946+7658, reported in [13] without the values for individual systems, and therefore won’t be included in our
analysis.

parameters. Such a parameterization has been considered in all previous analyses of the Webb
et al. data [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and thus serves as a simple test of our analysis. We note that we do
not consider an additional monopole term, both because there is no strong statistical preference
for it in previous analyses [3, 4] and because physically such term would be understood as being
due to the assumption of terrestrial isotopic abundances, in particular of Magnesium—we refer
the interested reader to [17] for a detailed discussion of this point.

Additionally we will also consider a parameterization where there is an implicit time depen-
dence in addition to the spatial variation. Previous analyses considered the case of a dependence
on look-back time [3, 4], but this has the disadvantage of requiring a speciﬁc assumption of a
cosmological model, and moreover it’s not clear how such a dependence would emerge from
realistic varying α models. We will instead assume a logarithmic dependence on redshift

∆α

(A, z, Ψ) = A ln (1 + z) cos Ψ ;

this has the advantage of not requiring any additional free parameters, but such dependencies are
also typical of dilaton-type models [18]. As in previous analyses, this parameterization is mainly
considered as a means to assess the ability of the data to discriminate between models.

3. Results

We used standard likelihood techniques to ﬁt the two parameterizations to our datasets. We
considered grids of size 2003, for the Amplitude of the dipole and the Right Ascension and
Declination of its north pole. We assumed a positive value of the amplitude and uniform priors
on all three parameters. It is intuitively clear (but we have nevertheless explicitly checked it,
as a further test of our analysis pipeline) that allowing also for negative values of the amplitude

would lead to degenerate plots, with a speciﬁc amplitude and its negative equally likely and two
opposite points on the sky also equally likely as the best-ﬁt poles.

Figures 1 and 2 and Table 2 summarize the results of our analysis for the case of the pure
spatial dipole. For the Webb et al. data alone we conﬁrm the results of previous analyses.
However, the addition of the more recent measurements has a signiﬁcant impact on the results.
While the statistical preference for a non-zero amplitude remains above the four-sigma level, the
most likely value (and the corresponding uncertainty) for this amplitude decreases considerably,
from 9.4 to 8.1 ppm. On the other hand the preferred direction of the north pole does not change
signiﬁcantly, but the corresponding uncertainties are reduced by about thirty percent in each
coordinate.

Figures 3 and 4 and Table 3 contain analogous results for the redshift-dependent dipole. Again
the statistical preference for a non-zero dipole is at more than four standard deviations, in this
case with a slightly larger value of the preferred amplitude. The uncertainties in all three ﬁtted
parameters also increase slightly, as compared to the pure spatial dipole case. In any case we
ﬁnd, in agreement with previous works, that current data cannot strongly discriminate between
the two classes of models.

4. Outlook

We have revisited recent indications of spatial variations of the ﬁne-structure constant, α, by
considering the impact of the current set of dedicated measurements listed in Table 1 on this
analysis. While this dataset is currently still small, it has already been shown that it plays a sig-
niﬁcant role in obtaining constraints on dark energy and Weak Equivalence Principle violations
[19]. Here we have conﬁrmed that they also have a noticeable impact on constraints on spatial
variations, thereby updating the original analysis of Webb et al.

Our analysis shows that a dipolar variation is still a good ﬁt to the combined dataset, with the
statistical preference for a non-zero amplitude remaining above the four-sigma level. However
the addition of the new data reduces the best-ﬁt amplitude as well as its uncertainty. The direction
on the sky of the north pole of such a dipole remains almost unchanged, but its uncertainty is
reduced by about thirty percent in each coordinate. Even with this additional data one can’t
yet statistically discriminate between a pure spatial dipole and one with an additional redshift
dependence.

Naturally the key concern regarding these measurements is the possible presence of hidden
systematics [11]. Additional measurements from the ongoing UVES Large Program should shed
further light on this subject. The dawn of a new generations of high-resolution ultra-stable spec-
trographs, of which ESPRESSO is the ﬁrst example [20], will be a key development, allowing
measurements not only with signiﬁcantly smaller statistical uncertainties but also with a much
better control over possible systematics. A roadmap for this ﬁeld can be found in [2].
