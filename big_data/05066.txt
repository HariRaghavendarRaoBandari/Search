It is known by now [1] that amorphous solids at zero temperature do not possess a nonlinear
elasticity theory: besides the shear modulus which exists, all the higher order coeﬃcients do not exist
in the thermodynamic limit. Here we show that the same phenomenon persists up to temperatures
comparable to the glass transition. The zero temperature mechanism due to the prevalence of
dangerous plastic modes of the Hessian matrix is replaced by anomalous stress ﬂuctuations that
lead to the divergence of the variances of the higher order elastic coeﬃcients. The conclusion is that
in amorphous solids elasticity can never be decoupled from plasticity: the nonlinear response is very
substantially plastic.

Introduction: By cooling glass forming liquids be-
low their glass transition temperature one forms amor-
phous solids. They are solid because particles are not free
to move ergodically, but rather can only vibrate around
equilibrium positions. They are amorphous because, dif-
ferently from crystals, those positions possess no long-
range periodicity. As a result of this, a glass sample is
always unique: while the structure of a crystalline solid
is always realized in the same manner (barring local de-
fects), the amorphous structure of a glass is randomly
selected [2, 3]. So, even if an ensemble of glasses is pre-
pared with a perfectly reproducible protocol, one always
ends up with pieces of material with diﬀerent structural
properties. Is it important to know whether these struc-
tural diﬀerences have any important eﬀect on the phys-
ical observables of the glass, or, in other words, which
observables would self average such that their sample-
to-sample ﬂuctuations would be negligible in the ther-
modynamic limit. Self-averaging assumptions go a long
way back, at least to Tool’s ﬁrst work on ﬁctive temper-
atures [4], and are a basic underlying assumption in the
ﬁeld of study of the thermodynamics of disordered sys-
tems in general [5], beyond structural glasses. As a mat-
ter of fact, self-averaging can be shown to be rigorously
realized (at least for systems with short-range interac-
tions) for extensive quantities as a consequence of the
Central Limit Theorem [5]. From an experimental point
of view, this means that if one measured an extensive ob-
servable (say the internal energy, or the thermal capacity)
in a given glass, the result would be representative of all
the glasses manufactured with the same protocol. From
a theoretical point of view, this means that some proper-
ties of glassy states can be safely computed by averaging
them over the amorphous structures available [6, 7]. The
assumption of self-averaging is not suﬃciently scrutinized
for intensive variables. While some observables strictly
related to the structure of the glass, such as the refrac-
tive index [8] do not self-average, it is still a common
assumption that all thermodynamic quantities, whether
extensive or intensive, should share this property.

In this Letter we show that this expectation is not met
in the case of the non-linear elastic coeﬃcients [9] of a
model molecular glass at all temperatures below the glass
transition. This leads to a breakdown of the elastic the-

ory for the material. It had been shown before that this
is the case for amorphous solids at zero temperature [1],
but one could think however that temperature ﬂuctua-
tions may destroy the relevance of the ﬁndings at T = 0.
We show in this Letter that it is not so: the presence
of anomalous sample-to-sample ﬂuctuations of non-linear
elastic coeﬃcients leads to a breakdown of elasticity the-
ory also in amorphous solids at experimentally and prac-
tically relevant temperatures.

Expressions of elastic coeﬃcients: Let us consider
a standard elasticity theory for a solid under simple shear
strain (with γxy = γ the only non-zero component of the
strain tensor). This is written in the form of a Taylor
expansion around zero strain [9]:

σ(γ) = B1γ +

B1 is the usual shear modulus that is usually denoted as
µ, µ ≡ B1. In a thermal setting, the stress can be written
as a canonical ensemble average [10–12]

where as usual β ≡ 1
kB T and V is the system’s volume;
U (X) is the system’s potential energy and the strain is
implemented through an aﬃne transformation of particle
coordinates [10]. The canonical average will be replaced
below by a time average, using time intervals τ for which
the variables measured reach a stationary value, but with
τ being much shorter than the glass relaxation time (de-
noted usually as τα). This time interval allows the sys-
tem to visit a restricted domain α(R) of conﬁgurations;
accordingly the integral is computed over this set of con-
ﬁgurations which are visited by the glass particles which
are conﬁned around an amorphous structure R [6, 13].

To compute the elastic coeﬃcients, one needs only to
take derivatives of Eq. (3) with respect to the strain.
Notice how in Eq. (3) the strain parameter is contained

in the derivative dU
dγ , in the Boltzmann factor, and in the
partition function Z(γ). When taking further derivatives
of the derivative term, one will in general get a term of the

kind D ∂nU

∂γ nE, while derivatives of the partition function

and Boltzmann factor will yield cumulants of the stress
and additional covariance terms. The shear modulus for
example has the expression [13]:

(5)

µ ≡ B1 =

1

V (cid:28) ∂2U

∂γ2(cid:29) − βV [(cid:10)σ2(cid:11) − hσi2],

which is the sum of a generalization of the Born term
found in crystalline solids [14] and thermal ﬂuctuations
of the stress. For the ﬁrst non-linear coeﬃcient B2 one
has

B2 =

1

∂γ3(cid:29) − 3βV [hσ′σi − hσ′i hσi]

V (cid:28) ∂3U
+ (βV )2(cid:10)(σ − hσi)3(cid:11) ,

where we have used the compact notation σ′ = ∂σ
∂γ . In
the appendix we derive the expressions for the nonlinear
coeﬃcients up to 3rd order. Since these coeﬃcients are
computed by sampling a glassy space of conﬁgurations
selected by an amorphous structure, their values will de-
pend on the particular glass sample under consideration,
as detailed in the Introduction. We are interested in their
probability distribution over samples, and in particular
in sample-to-sample ﬂuctuations

(δBn)2 ≡ (Bn − Bn)2 ,

(6)

where (•) denotes the average over samples. Naive
Central Limit Theorem considerations would suggest
(δBn)2 ≃ 1
V , which would imply self-averaging. In the
following we present evidence that this assumption fails
for all n ≥ 2.
Numerical simulations: We compute the elastic co-
eﬃcients Bn up to 3rd order from Molecular Dynamics
(MD) simulations of a Kob-Andersen [15] 65/35 binary
mixture in two dimensions. The Lennard-Jones poten-
tials used are detailed in the SI. We always start by sim-
ulating the liquid at T = 0.4, whereupon the relaxation of
the binary correlation function is still exponential. Next
we cool the system at a rate of 10−6 in Lennard-Jones
time units, as explained in the appendix, to the ﬁnal tar-
get temperature of T = 10−6. The system is now heated
up instantaneously to a working temperature in the range
T ∈ [0.05, 0.35] in steps of 0.05. The system is then “equi-
librated” by running 100,000 MD steps. To measure any
desired quantity we now run τ = 200, 000 MD steps and
measure the time average of the said quantity. Thus for
example if we want to measure hσ4i we compute

hσ4i ≡ τ −1

realizations for T = 0.15, for system sizes from N = 200 to
N = 10000. The lines are Gaussian ﬁts to the data, from
which we compute the variances. The distribution of the
shear modulus sharpens when the system size increases. The
distributions of B2 and B3 broaden with increasing system
size, refuting any hope for self-averaging. The distributions
of higher order coeﬃcients broaden faster and faster.

quantity in this way, we repeat the process 1000 times,
using diﬀerent initial conﬁgurations from the run at
T = 0.4, each of which will yield a diﬀerent glass sam-
ple, or realization. The found values are histogrammed
and normalized to yield a probability distribution func-
tion (pdf). This pdf is now used to evaluate the average
over the 1000 samples and the variance, Eq. (6). Our nu-
merical setup is thus equivalent to the production of an
ensemble of glass samples, each manufactured with the
same, exactly reproduced protocol.

Results: a representative set of results for the distri-
butions of B1, B2 and B3 over the realizations is shown
in Fig. 1 for T = 0.15. Similar results are seen for all the
temperature range: the distribution of the shear modulus
over the realizations sharpens with the system size, in-

dicating self averaging in the thermodynamic limit. The
distributions of B2 and B3 (and in fact of all Bn with
n ≥ 2) broaden rapidly with increasing system sizes, in-
dicating a breakdown of self-averaging and of nonlinear
elasticity. The rate of broadening of the distributions in-
creases with the order of the coeﬃcient under considera-
tion. As an example, let us consider the variances of the
distributions of the ﬁrst three moduli; to evaluate their
ﬁnite-size scaling, we perform Gaussian least-squares ﬁts
of the data and consider the resulting variances, which
are shown in Fig 2 as a function of the system size at
diﬀerent temperatures. Denoting the variance of Bk as
(δBk)2 we ﬁnd that

(δB1)2 ∼ N α1 , (δB2)2 ∼ N α2 , (δB3)2 ∼ N α3 ,

(8)

With α1 = −0.68 ± 0.08, α2 = 0.78 ± 0.05 and α3 =
1.92±0.06 independently of the temperature in the range
T ∈ [0.05, 0.25].
To shed light on the breakdown of self-averaging it is
useful to consider the sample-to-sample ﬂuctuations of
the moments of the stress. We note that the ﬂuctuations

to consider the sample-to-sample ﬂuctuations of Xk ≡
N k−1hσki. Accordingly we consider the pdf’s of P (Xk)
over our glass samples. In Fig. 3 we show representative
results of these pdf’s in a rescaled form. The upshot
of the analysis is that we can collapse the data of these
pdf’s for diﬀerent system sizes if we plot N k/2−1P (Xk)
as a function of N k/2hσki. It is an immediate exercise
to evaluate therefore the system size dependence of the
variance of Xk, denoted here as (δXk)2, obtaining the

that the convergent result for (δB1)2 and the fact that
α2 < 1 and α3 < 2 must follow from a cancellation of the

the present work is that this phenomenon is accompa-
nied by a breakdown of nonlinear elasticity in much the
same way reported above. The available theory pertains
to a mean ﬁeld treatment and comparison of exponents
is probably not warranted. Nevertheless it is interesting
that the shear modulus is expected to exist, and the vari-
ances of Bk with k ≥ 3 are expected to diverge with the
system size, in agreement with the predictions of Ref. [1]
and the ﬁndings of the present Letter.
In Ref. [19] it
is also predicted that the phenomenon should disappear
when the system is heated above the (protocol depen-
dent) Gardner temperature, a claim that we are not in
position to conﬁrm or refute. A careful search of a pu-
tative Gardner temperature would require repeating our
analysis on extremely slowly quenched glasses as a way to
provide a good separation of the Gardner point and the
point of disappearance of the shear modulus [19]. Such
an analysis is beyond the scope of the present Letter but
appears to be a worthwhile endeavor for future research.

leading N dependence in the terms involving the stress
ﬂuctuations. A precise determination of the scaling ex-
ponents and the question of their universality or non-
universality must await a very extensive set of numerical
simulations which are outside the scope of this Letter.

Discussion:

It is interesting to examine the corre-
spondence between the divergence of the variances of the
nonlinear elastic coeﬃcients at T = 0 and at ﬁnite tem-
perature. At T = 0 the expression for the shear modulus,
instead of Eq. 4, reads [16]

B1(T = 0) =

∂2U
∂γ2 −

V

Ξ · H−1 · Ξ ,

(10)

where H is the Hessian matrix and Ξ ≡ ∂2U/∂ ri∂γ.
Higher order nonlinear moduli contain three, ﬁve, and
more factors of H−1 and their sample to sample ﬂuc-
tuations stem from the existence of arbitrarily small
eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix when the system size
increases[1]. It can be proven that the stress ﬂuctuation
term in Eq. 4 approaches smoothly the second term in
Eq. (10), and that the cumulant terms in Bk(T ) approach
in the same way the analogous term of the athermal coun-
terpart, see [17] and appendix. In recent years, much re-
search has been devoted to the concept of marginality [18]
in disordered systems, which can be broadly deﬁned as
the possibility to destabilize a system with a generic per-
turbation without having to pay an energy cost. In the
case of athermal systems, such as jammed packings, those
perturbations are mechanical in nature (for example, the
opening of a contact between two grains in a packing)
and marginality manifests under the guise of arbitrar-
ily low-lying eigenvalues in the Hessian of the system,
related to ﬂoppy modes that can be excited with no en-
ergy cost. As detailed in [1], they are precisely those
modes that cause the breakdown of non-linear elastic-
ity in athermal glasses. The correspondence between the
second term in Eq (10) and the stress ﬂuctuations of the
thermal case (which, as we pointed out, cause the break-
down of non-linear elasticity in the present case) high-
lights how the mechanical marginality found in ather-
mal amorphous systems must have a thermal, thermody-
namic counterpart in terms of the presence of anomalous
thermal ﬂuctuations, which in turn induce, through the
Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem, an anomalous response
of the system to even arbitrarily small thermodynamic
perturbations, such as strain or a magnetic ﬁeld. We
argue that a better understanding of the links between
mechanical and thermal marginality is paramount for the
ﬁnal achievement of a complete and consistent theoretical
picture of the physics of amorphous systems.

Finally we should relate these ﬁndings to a recent the-
oretical work [19] predicting a so-called Gardner transi-
tion [20] in thermal glass forming liquids [19, 21]. Fun-
damentally the prediction is that at some temperature,
lower than the glass transition temperature, there should
be a qualitative change in the nature of the free-energy
landscape, generating a rough scenery with arbitrarily
small barriers between local minima. The connection to

algorithm with a time step of ∆t =0.005 in reduced units. A Berendsen thermostat, with a time constant of 5 in
reduced units, was used to maintain the desired temperature. All simulations have been performed at constant density
ρ = 1.162 with system sizes ranging from N =200 to N =10000 and a temperature range from T =0.05 to T =0.35
with a gap of 0.05.

FIG. 4. Data collapse of the P (Xk) obtained with the scaling ansatz reported in the main text. Even though it is a purely
phenomenological ansatz without a theoretical justiﬁcation, the results are satisfying.

3. Protocol for the Preparation of Amorphous Solids:

In order to prepare amorphous solids, we always start with a random conﬁguration generated at ρ =1.162 and then
equilibrate it at a high temperature T = 0.4 for 400,000 MD steps. At this temperature correlation functions still
decay exponentially and the system behaves like a liquid. Next, we cool down the system, with a cooling rate of
∆T = 10−6 in reduced units, to a target temperature of T = 0.000001. We repeat this process starting from diﬀerent
initial conditions at T = 0.4 to generate the ensemble of 1000 amorphous solids at each system size.

4. Data collapse for higher order moments

To complement the data presented in Fig. 3 of the main text we report in Fig. 4 the data collapse obtained with

the scaling ansatz N k/2−1P (Xk) = f (N k/2(cid:10)σk(cid:11)) for k = 2, 3, 6.

Appendix C: Low-temperature limit of thermal ﬂuctuations

We show here that, for two generic observables A(X) and B(X), one has

lim
β→∞

β[hA(X)B(X)i − hA(X)ihB(X)i] = [∇A · H−1 · ∇B](cid:12)(cid:12)X=X ∗

Where H−1 is the inverse Hessian of the system and X ∗ is the inherent structure the systems settles in when T → 0.
The proof is already provided in [22] in the case of elastic coeﬃcients, here we report a simpler derivation for two
generic observables. We start by considering the average

(C1)

(C2)

hAi = R dX A(X)e−βU(X)
R dX e−βU(X)

= R dX e−β[U(X)−
R dX e−βU(X)

β log A(x)]

We compute the integrals with the saddle point method [23]. Let us expand the arguments of the exponentials around
the inherent structure. We get for the numerator:

Z dX A(X ∗) exp{−β[U (X ∗) −

where A is a matrix deﬁned as

where the Latin indexes denote particle coordinates and Greek ones spatial axes. The integral in the numerator in a
Gaussian integral with a linear term, which can be straightforwardly computed. One gets

while the result for the denominator is

(C6)

(C7)

where d is the number of dimensions (d = 2 in the present case, but the derivation is valid for any d); in summary,
we get for hAi

2β (cid:18)∇A

A · A−1 · ∇A

so in the T → 0 limit we get, as expected

T →0hAi = A(X ∗).

Let us now consider hABi and hAi hBi. We get, using the same reasoning,
B (cid:19) · C −1 ·(cid:18)∇A

We now expand the exponential in both expressions. Since both are multiplied by β, we have to keep only the zeroth
and the ﬁrst orders, as all other terms will go to zero in the β → ∞ limit. We get
β[hABi − hAihBi] ≃ βA(X ∗)B(X ∗)(r detH

We must now take the β → ∞ limit. The O( 1

β ) terms in parentheses are easy to handle, and one gets

since

[∇A · H−1 · ∇B],

lim
β→∞C = H,
β→∞A = H,
lim
lim
β→∞B = H.

The zeroth order term requires more caution. At the leading order in 1

β , one has in general

(C17)

(C18)

(C19)

where N ′ is a matrix whose ﬁrst row is the ﬁrst row of N and all the other rows are the other rows of M . This is due
to the fact that the determinant of a matrix is a linear application in each of the matrix’s rows (or columns). So one
gets, for the zeroth order term,

detC −r detH

So the zeroth order term adds up to zero, and we are left with

which is our thesis. In the case A(X) = B(X) = 1

lim
β→∞

β[hA(X)B(X)i − hA(X)ihB(X)i] = [∇A · H−1 · ∇B](cid:12)(cid:12)X=X ∗ ,

∂U
∂γ , one gets back the expression

where Ξ ≡ ∇ ∂U

∂γ . We thus recover the know athermal expression [16, 22, 24] for the shear modulus

This shows how, in the thermal case, the mechanism for divergence of the shear moduli as a consequence of the
presence of low-lying modes in the Hessian of the potential energy (i.e. marginality in the mechanical sense), is now
replaced by a mechanism in terms of anomalous ﬂuctuations and, as a result of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem,
anomalous non-linear response of the system to external perturbations (i.e. marginality in the thermodynamic sense),
as discussed in the main text.
