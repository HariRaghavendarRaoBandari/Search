TAMENESS IN THE FR ´ECHET SPACES OF ANALYTIC

FUNCTIONS

AYDIN AYTUNA

Dedicated to the memory of Tosun Terzio˘glu

Abstract. A Fr´echet space, X , with a sequence of generating semi-
norms {k·kk}∞
k=1 is called tame in case there exists an increasing function
σ : N → N, such that for every continuous linear operator T from X
into itself, there exists an N0 and C > 0 such that

kT (x)kn ≤ Ckxkσ(n),

∀x ∈ X and n ≥ N0.

This property does not depend upon the choice of fundamental system of
semi-norms for X and is a property of the Fr´echet space X . In this paper
we investigate tameness in the Fr´echet spaces O(M ) of analytic func-
tions on Stein manifolds M equipped with the compact open topology.
Actually we will look into tameness in the more general class of nuclear
Fr´echet spaces with the properties DN and Ω of Vogt and then special-
ize to analytic function spaces. We will show that for a Stein manifold
M , tameness of O(M ) is equivalent to the hyperconvexity of M .

1. Introduction

Tameness of Fr´echet spaces is an important property frequently used in
functional analysis since it brings a kind of control on the otherwise chaotic
behaviour of continuous linear endomorphisms. This concept was used eﬀec-
tively in the structure theory of nuclear Fr´echet spaces, especially in ﬁnding
bases in complemented subspaces of certain inﬁnite type power series spaces
[9]. Frequently the Fr´echet spaces that arise in practical applications (e.g.
in non-linear analysis), enjoy (versions of) the tameness property ([11, 28]).
In fact, an inquiry about the tameness of the analytic function spaces was
conveyed, sometime ago, in this context by D. Zarnadze [private communi-
cation]. In this paper we answer this question in a kind of negative way. We
show that there are no tame analytic function spaces other than the natural
ones (Theorem 4.4).

The organization of the paper is as follows: After establishing the no-
tation and terminology, in section 1, we recall the deﬁnition of the linear

topological invariants DN and Ω and introduce the technical tool that we
will use in the later sections, namely local imbeddings of power series spaces
of ﬁnite type into Fr´echet spaces. After some general results on local imbed-
dings we establish a link between the approximate diametral dimension of
the space and the existence of eﬀective local imbeddings from certain ﬁnite
type power series spaces (Theorem 2.9).

Section 2 is devoted to Theorem 3.2 and its proof which characterizes
tame nuclear Fr´echet spaces having a ﬁnitely nuclear stable exponent se-
quence and enjoying the properties DN and Ω.

In the ﬁrst subsection of section 3 we show how the local imbeddings can
be used to construct Green’s functions on complex manifolds. The second
subsection of the same section is devoted to diametral dimension considera-
tions of analytic function spaces and the proof of the main theorem Theorem
4.4 of this paper.

Notations and Terminology: We will use the terminology of [15] and
refer the reader to this book for the undeﬁned concepts and the standard
results of functional analysis that we will use. For the notions from complex
potential theory used (especially in section 3) we refer the reader to [12].

Power series sequence spaces play an important role in this paper. Recall

that these are Fr´echet spaces

∀ − ∞ < r < R}

where R is either 1 or ∞, and α = (αn)n is a sequence of complex numbers
with sup ln(n)
< +∞, called the exponent sequence of the space. The grading
αn
on these spaces will be the hilbertian grading {| · |r}r<R.

These spaces are referred to as ﬁnite type power series spaces if R =
1 and inﬁnite type power series spaces if R = ∞, respectively. We will
.
use the notation Λ1[α] to denote the Hilbert space {(ξn)∞
=

|(ξn)|r

n=0 :

For a pair of Fr´echet spaces {X , k·kk }k and {Y,

| |k}k the set of all
continuous linear operators will be denoted by L(X , Y). We will use the
symbol

.
= sup
kxkn≤1
for a T ∈ L(X , Y). Note that k · kn

|T x|m, n, m ∈ N

m can take the value +∞.

For a Fr´echet space, {X , k·kk }k, the local Hilbert spaces corresponding
to the norm k kk will be denoted by Xk, k = 1, 2, . . . . The closed unit ball in
X corresponding to the semi-norm k kk will be denoted by Uk, k = 1, 2, . . . .

Throughout the paper we will reserve the symbol ǫn to denote the se-

quence (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . ) where 1 is in the nth place.

2. Local Imbeddings of Power Series Spaces of Finite Type

into Fr´echet Spaces

In this section we will examine local imbeddings of power series spaces

of ﬁnite type into nuclear Fr´echet spaces with the properties DN and Ω.

In subsection 2.1 we recall the deﬁnition of the linear topological invari-
ants DN and Ω of Vogt and list some properties of Fr´echet spaces with
properties DN and Ω, that will be used in the sequel. We emphasize again
that all the Fr´echet spaces that we will deal with in this paper will be
assumed to be nuclear and satisfy the properties DN and Ω unless other-
wise speciﬁed. In subsection 2.2 we will investigate the existence of local
imbeddings. In subsection 2.3 we consider Fr´echet spaces whose diametral
approximative dimension is equal to a ﬁnite type power series space and
show that this property yields local imbeddings.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A continuous linear operator T from Λ1(α) into a graded
Fr´echet space {X , k·kn} is called an (r, k)-local imbedding in case;

∃ C > 0 :

kT (x)kk ≥ C|x|r,

∀ x ∈ Λ1(α).

We will say that a Fr´echet space X admits an r-local imbedding from Λ1(α),
in case there exists a continuous linear operator T from Λ1(α) in X with
the property;

∃ continuous semi-norm k·k of X and C > 0

such that kT (x)k ≥ C|x|r ∀ x ∈ Λ1(α).

2.1. Linear topological invariants DN , Ω and associated exponent
sequences.

Deﬁnition 2.2. A nuclear Fr´echet space X is said to have properties DN
and Ω ([21], [24]) in case there exists a fundamental system of hilbertian
norms {k kk}k generating the topology of X which satisfy

(DN) :

∀k ∃ 0 < λ < 1 and C > 0 such that

For more information about these invariants and examples of Fr´echet

spaces possessing these properties we refer the reader to [15].

Let U and V , V ⊆ U be 2 subsets of a Fr´echet space X . We will use the

notation En(U, V ) to denote

En(U, V )

.
= − ln dn(V, U), n = 0, 1, 2

where

dn(V, U)

.
= inf
Ln

inf {λ : λ > 0, V ⊆ λU + Ln}

(inﬁmum is taken over all n-dimensional subspaces Ln of X ) is the nth
Kolmogorov diameter of V in U.

In the case of a graded Fr´echet space (X , k kk ), we simplify this notation

by setting

En(p, k)

.
= En(Up, Uk),

∀ p < k.

Let us now ﬁx a nuclear Fr´echet space X , with the properties DN and
Ω, and choose the grading {k kk}k, derived from these properties. In [5] (c.f
[4]) we have shown that all the sequences {En(k, k + 1)}n, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . are
equivalent and called this equivalence class the exponent sequence associated
to X . In this paper we, unless stated otherwise, will use a concrete repre-
.
sentation, En
= En(0, 1), n = 0, 1, 2, of the associate exponent sequence of
X .

We compile ([20]) some properties of these sequences that will be used

in the sequel.

Proposition 2.3. Let (X , k kk) be as above. An Ω-type condition;

∃ 0 < λ < 1, D > 0 : Uq ⊂ r

(3) ∃ C > 0; En(q, k) ≤ λ
A DN -type condition:

1−λEn(p, q) + C, ∀ n,
1−λEn(p, q) + C, ∀ n,

implies the inequalities:

λEn(q; k) + C, n = 0, 1, . . . ,

1−λEn(q, k) + C, n = 0, 1, . . . ,

In the presence of both Ω and DN-type conditions we have

(4) ∃ C > 0, 0 < λ1 < 1, 0 < λ2 < 1; En ≤

2.2. Local imbeddings of power series spaces of ﬁnite type into
nuclear Fr´echet spaces with properties DN and Ω.

We now turn our attention to the question of existence of local imbed-
dings into the graded Fr´echet space (X , k kk) ﬁxed in subsection 2.1 above.
But we ﬁrst consider some general considerations concerning local imbed-
dings.

Proposition 2.4. Let Λ1(α) be a nuclear power series space of ﬁnite type.
The following assertions are equivalent;

(i) There exists an (r, k)-local imbedding from Λ1(α) into X
(ii) There exists a sequence {gn}∞

n=0 in X that is orthogonal in Xk and

satisﬁes;

limn

ln kgnks

αn

< 1 − r,

∀ s

(iii) There exists an isometry from the local Hilbert space Λr[α] into Hk

that induces a continuous linear operator from Λ1(α) into X

(iv) There exists a closed, Hilbertian bounded disc B which satisﬁes;

∃ C > 0 such that dn(B, Uk) ≥ Ce−(1−r)αn

Proof.

(i)⇒(ii): Fix an (r, k)-local imbedding T with kT (x)kk ≥ C1|x|r, ∀ x ∈ X .

Consider

From continuity of T we get for every s, a r < σ(s) < 1 and C > 0
such that,

This operator is plainly a continuous linear operator from Λ1(α) into
X that extends to an isometry from Λr[αn] into Xk.

Consider the set

B

where h, ik is the inner product corresponding to k kk.

A direct computation will show that B is the image under T of

the compact set B0 = {(ξn); P |ξn|2e2αn ≤ 1} in Λ1(α). So B is a

compact disc that is Hilbertian and it follows that (see Lemma 6.2.2
of [8])

dn(B, Uk) ≥ dn(B ∩ T (X ), T (X ) ∩ Uk) = e(r−1)αn

(iv)⇒(i): Let HB denote the Hilbert space generated by B in X . Since the
inclusion HB ֒→ Xk is a compact operator we can choose a se-
quence {fn}∞
n=0 of orthogonal vectors in HB that are orthogonal in
the Hilbert space Xk and kfnkB = (dn(B, Uk))−1 , n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

Choose λ+ so that, 0 < r + λ(1 − λ) < λ+ < 1. There exists

It follows that T deﬁnes a continuous linear operator from Λ1(α)
into X . Moreover

kT ((ξn))kk = Xn

Hence T is a (r, k)-local imbedding.

= |(ξn)|r.

(cid:3)

Remark. Contrary to the inﬁnite case ([5]), the existence of an (r, k)-local
imbedding from a ﬁnite type power series space into a graded Fr´echet space
need not imply the existence of an (r+, k)-local imbedding for r+ > r. In
fact it is not diﬃcult to see that for a nuclear ﬁnite type power series space
X = Λ1(α), there exists a (r1, r2)-local imbedding from Λ1(α) into X if
and only if r1 ≤ r2. Indeed if there is a bounded set B in X such that
dn(B, Ur2) ≥ Ce(r1−1)αn for some C > 0, then for any r2 < s < 1, there
exists a C1 > 0 such that B ⊆ C1Us which implies that

dn(B, Ur) ≤ C1dn(Us, Ur) = Ce(r2−s)αn

for every n. Hence r1 − 1 ≤ r2 − 1 or r1 ≤ r2.

The condition in (iv) of the above Proposition can also be expressed by

using the unit balls of the grading:

Proposition 2.5. There exists a (r, p)-local imbedding from Λ1(α) into X
if and only if

limn

k>p

En(p, k)

Proof.

(⇐): Let ρ and r satisfy the given inequality. For a given k > p in view

of Proposition 2.4 (iii) we have;

∃ 0 < ρ < 1;

limn

En(p, k)

αn

≤ ρ limn

En(p, k + 1)

αn

AYDIN AYTUNA

So for each k > p we can ﬁnd a N(k) ∈ N, strictly increasing with
respect to k, such that

− ln dn(Uk, Up) < (1 − r)αn.

Let δ1 = 1/2e−(1−r)αN(p+1) . Since Up+1 is precompact in Xp there
exists a ﬁnite set Z 1

1 ⊆ Up+1 such that;

dn(Up+1, Up) ≤ dn(Z 1

1 , Up) + δ1 ∀ n

Hence

dN (p+1)(Z 1

1 , Up) ≥ e−(1−r)αnN(p+1) − δ1 = 1/2e−(1−r)αnN(p+1)

For each n, with N(p + 1) ≤ n < N(p + 2), we obtain, as above, a
ﬁnite set Z 1

n ⊆ Up+1 satisfying

dn(Z 1

and set Z 1 .

Continuing in this fashion we get ﬁnite sets Z s, s = 1, 2, . . . with
Z s ⊆ Up+s and dn(Z s, Up) ≥ (e−(1−r)αn)/2 for N(p + s) ≤ n <
s=1 Z s is a bounded set since ∀ k =
p + s, Z ¯s ⊆ Uk, ¯s > s. We can ﬁnd a closed Hilbertian disc B in
s=1 Z s (see for example in Lemma 1.2 of [23]). For
this disc and n > N(p + 1)(say N(p + s) ≤ n < N(p + s + 1)) we
have

dn(B, Up) ≥ dn(Z s, Up) ≥

e−(1−r)αn

2

So in view of Proposition 2.4 (iv) there is a (r,p)-local imbedding
from Λ1(α) into X .

(⇒): This implication follows immediately from Proposition 2.4 (iv). In-
deed in view of Proposition 2.4 (iv) there exists a bounded set B
and C > 0 with dn(B, Up) ≥ Ce−(1−r)αn, n = 1, 2, . . . . Hence
∀ k ∃ Ci > 0, i = 1, 2;

En(p, k) ≤ − ln dn(B, Up) + C1

≤ (1 − r)αn + C2.

So;

En(p, k)

Remark. Although the structural assumption DN on X is put into use
in the Proposition above, the implication (⇒) can be proved without any

structural assumptions on X . One can use the argument given in Proposition
2.3 of [4] to give a proof by just using the deﬁnition of local imbeddings.

2.3. Approximate diametral dimension and local imbeddings.

In this subsection we investigate the relationship between approximate
diametral dimension of a nuclear Fr´echet space X with properties DN and
Ω and the existence of local imbeddings from Λ1(En), the ﬁnite type power
series space corresponding to the associated exponent sequence of X . Since
we wish to use the information obtained in the previous subsections, we are
forced to put an additional assumption on {En}n, namely we will assume
that, limn ln(n)/En = 0. This assumption guaranties the nuclearity of Λ1(En)
([8]), which will be needed in the sequel and also for the validity of the results
of previous subsections.

Deﬁnition 2.6. [7]. The Approximate Diametral Dimension of a Fr´echet
space Y , δ(Y ), is deﬁned as;

[

B∈ bounded subsets of Y(cid:26)(tn) : lim

n

tn

dn(B, U)

= 0(cid:27)

[

δ(Y )

.
=

U ∈ zero neighborhoods of Y

= {(tn)n : ∃ a neighborhood of zero U and a bounded set B of Y

such that lim
n

tn

dn(B, U)

= 0}.

Approximate diametral dimension also admits a representation solely in
terms of basis for the zero neighborhoods, {Un}n of the Fr´echet space Y as;
δ(Y ) = {(tn) : ∃ s ∀ k ≥ s; tn/dn(Uk, Us) → 0} (See [7]).

Now let us ﬁx, for the rest of this subsection, a graded nuclear Fr´echet

space (cid:8)X , k kk(cid:9) with the properties DN, Ω, whose associated exponent

sequence (En) satisﬁes (ln(n)/En) →n 0, the grading {k kk}k that is coming
from the deﬁnition 2.2. Given p < p + 1 < q, in view of Proposition 2.3 (1),
we have the inequality dn(Uq, Up+1)
d ≤ Cdn(Uq, Up+1) for some C > 0 and
0 < λ < 1. So if a sequence (tn)n satisﬁes

1

then

|tn|

dn(Uq, Up)

≤ C ∀n, for some C

|tn|

dn(Uq, Up+1)

→ 0

Hence under our assumptions, we have

δ(X ) = {(tn)n :

∃ p; ∀ q > p sup

n

|tn|eEn(p,q) < ∞}.

This linear space becomes a Banach space under |(tn)|pq
Since B(p, q+) ⊆ B(p, q) for p < q < q+, the space B(p)
with the fundamental generating norms {| · |pq} becomes a Fr´echet
space. Moreover by means of continuous inclusions B(¯p) ֒→ B(p), ¯p <

=Tq>p B(p, q)
p, we can put the inductive limit topology on δ(X ) =Sn B(p) and

.
= supn |tn|eEn(p,q).
.

thus view δ(X ) as a locally convex space which is an inductive limit
of Fr´echet spaces. Let us ﬁx a r, 0 < r < 1 and deﬁne

Clearly Sr is a Banach space with respect to the norm k · k, and
Sr ⊂ δ(Λ1(α)). By our assumption, Sr ⊂ δ(X ) and since projections
onto coordinates are continuous with respect to the inductive limit
topology on δ(X ), the inclusion Sr ֒→ δ(X ) is a sequentially closed
linear operator. In view of Grothendieck Factorization theorem ([13,
p. 225]), there is a p(r) such that for every q > p(r)

∃ C > 0 :

sup

n

|tn|eEn(p(r),q) ≤ C sup

for any (tn) ∈ Sr. In particular for every q > p(r) there exists a

(⇐): Fix an r < 1 and choose a (tn)n which satisﬁes

In view of our assumption, we choose a p so that supq≥p limn

Hence, ∀ q > p ∃ Cq > 0; eEn(p,q) ≤ Cq/rαn; which in turn implies
that ∀ q > p; supn |tn|eEn(p,q) < +∞. It follows that:

δ (Λ1(α)) ⊆[p \q>p

B(p, q) = δ(X ).

If we focus our attention to the associated exponent sequence (En)n we

have:

In view of Proposition 2.3 (4), there exists constants C1 > 0, C2 > 0 such

It follows that;

Hence we always have δ(X ) ⊆ δ(Λ1(E)). Now the corollary follows from

We conclude this section with a summary theorem:

Theorem 2.9. Let X be a nuclear Fr´echet space with the properties DN
and Ω. We also assume that the associated exponent sequence (En)n of X ,
is a nuclear exponent sequence of ﬁnite type (i.e. Λ1(En) is nuclear). Then
the following assertions are equivalent:

(1) δ(X ) = δ(Λ1(E))
(2) inf 1≤p<∞ supq>p limn

(3) There exists an r-local imbedding from Λ1(E) into X for every 0 <

r < 1.

3. Tame Spaces, X , with Properties DN , Ω and δ(X ) = δ(Λ1(E))

To every continuous linear operator T between two graded F-spaces
{X , k kk }k and {Y, | |k}k one can associate a sequence of natural numbers,
{σT (n)}n, called the characteristic of continuity of T , via

σT (n)

.
= inf {s :

∃ C > 0; |T (x)|n ≤ Ckxks∀ x ∈ X }

In general the characteristics of continuity of operators between graded
Fr´echet spaces could be very disorderly. However for certain pairs of Fr´echet
spaces control over the growth of characteristics of continuity can be ob-
tained. For example, in the space of analytic functions on the unit disc,

O(∆), with the grading kf kk
O(∆), it is not diﬃcult to see that;

e−n/k,

k = 1, 2, . . . , f ∈

2

.

n=0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) f n(0)
n! (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
= P∞

∀ T ∈ L(O(∆), O(∆)), ∃ a ∈ N such that σT (n) ≤ an,

∀ n = 1, 2, . . .

Following ([22], [9] c.f. [16]) we specify this property as:

Deﬁnition 3.1. A pair of Fr´echet spaces X and Y will be called a tame-pair
in case for a given pair of generating semi-norms {k kk}k of X and {| |k}k
of Y there exists an increasing function ψ : N → N such that

∀ T ∈ L(X , Y),

∃ N ∈ N;

σT (n) ≤ ψ(n),

∀ n ≥ N.

In case X = Y we say that the Fr´echet space X is tame.

We will use the symbol (X , Y) ∈ T in case (X , Y) form a tame-pair.

Remark.

(1) The deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of semi-norms in the

spaces X and Y.

(2) Plainly the deﬁnition is equivalent to the existence of a sequence,
for a given pair of generating semi-norms {k kk}k of X and {| |k}k
of Y, {SK}k of increasing functions SK : N → N, such that for
every T ∈ L(X , Y), there exists a K with σT (n) ≤ SK(n) for every
n = 1, 2, . . . .

(3) The space O(∆) is tame. More generally every power series space of
ﬁnite type is tame, as was observed by various authors (see 2.1 on
[9] for details). A proof of this appears in 2.1 of [16].

TAMENESS IN THE FR ´ECHET SPACES OF ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS

(4) If (X , Y) ∈ T , then the space of all continuous linear operators from

{X , k kk} into {Y, | |k} admits a representation of the form

L(X , Y) =

∞[K=1

∞\n=1

{T ∈ L(X , Y) :

∃ C > 0 kT (x)kn ≤ C|x|SK (n), ∀ x ∈ X }

Using this representation one can put a linear topology on L(X , Y)
making it an LF-space (i.e. inductive limit of Fr´echet spaces) by
.
considering the semi-norms (2.1, [9]) kT kn
= sup|x|SK (n)≤1 kT (x)kn
K
on the space

{T ∈ L(X , Y) : ∃C > 0 kT (x)kn ≤ C|x|SK (n), ∀x ∈ X }, K, n ∈ N.

therefore .....

This structure allows one to use the results of well studied LF-spaces in
the study of L(X , Y) for (X , Y) ∈ T . These ideas are used in the study of
nuclear Fr´echet spaces X which form a tame pair with nuclear stable power
series spaces of ﬁnite or inﬁnite type in [17] where a complete characteriza-
tion of such spaces in terms of the linear topological invariants of Vogt are
obtained.

In this section we will, once again, consider nuclear Fr´echet spaces, X
with the properties DN and Ω. We will assume that the associated exponent
sequence of X , E = (En)n in addition to our usual assumption of being
ﬁnitely nuclear is also stable; i.e. supn(E2n/En) < ∞.

Theorem 3.2. Let X be a nuclear Fr´echet space with stable ﬁnitely nuclear
associated exponent sequence E = (En) and which has properties DN and
Ω. Then X is isomorphic to a power series space of ﬁnite type if and only
if X is tame and δ(X ) = δ(Λ1(E)).

Proof.

(⇒):

If X is isomorphic to a power series space of ﬁnite type then X
must be isomorphic to Λ1(E) by Proposition 2.3 of [5]. So δ(X ) =
δ(Λ1(E)). Moreover X being a ﬁnite type power series space, is tame
in view of Remark 3 (4) above.

(⇐): Let us ﬁx a tame nuclear Fr´echet space with stable ﬁnitely nuclear
associated exponent sequence E = (En), and which has properties
DN and Ω. In view of [22], we can imbed X into Λ1(E) as a closed
subspace. We will do so and consider the grading on X induced
| |r ). Throughout this proof we will, as usual, use the
by (Λ1(E),
notation ǫn to denote the sequence (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . ) where 1 sits in

14

the nth place, n = 1, 2, . . . . In view of Theorem 2.9 above there exists
an r-local imbedding from Λ1(E) into X for every 0 ≤ r < 1. Let us
ﬁx an r0 < 1 and a corresponding (r0, rk0), rk0 < 1, local imbedding
≥ C0|x|r0, ∀ x ∈ Λ1(E). Let
T , from Λ1(E) into X . Say |T x|rk0

= (ǫn/er0En), n = 1, 2, . . . be the canonical orthonormal basis of
en
Λr0[En], and set gn

.
= T (en), n = 1, 2, . . . .

We note that {gn}∞

n=1 is a ﬁnitely linearly independent sequence
since T is a local imbedding. We choose a sequence {fn} in X ⊆
Λ1(E) satisfying;
(1) fn ∈ span{g1, . . . , g2n}, n = 1, 2, . . . .
(2) hfn, fsirk0
(3) hfn, ǫkirk0
(4) hfn, fnirk0
where h, irk0

is the inner product in Λrk0

[ǫ].

Such a sequence exists and can be selected by induction since for
each n ∈ N, the space {g1, . . . , g2n} is 2n-dimensional and we impose
2n − 1 conditions for fn.

Hence bT is an (r0, rk0)-local isomorphism from Λ1(E2n) into X .
Moreover bT has the additional property that it extends to be

We now vary r < 1, and obtain a family {bTr} of (r, rkr )-local

|bTr(x)|s ≤ C|x|ρ(s)

After these preparations we now proceed to show that(cid:16)X , Λ1(cid:0)(E2n)(cid:1)(cid:17) ∈

According to our assumption, there exists a sequence {Sα}∞

α=1 of
increasing functions from N into N, such that ∀T ∈ L(X , X ) and
∃α ∈ N such that σ(T ) ≤ Sα.

Let now S be a given continuous linear operator from X into

Λ1(cid:0)E2n)(cid:1). In view of (2.7) above, the family, {bTr ◦S}r<1 of continuous

In particular for each r < 1 there exists a bC > 0 such that;
Now if we set bSα(r)
shows that ∀S ∈ L(cid:16)X , Λ1(cid:0)(E2n)(cid:1)(cid:17) ∃ n ∈ N such that σS ≤ bSα.
Hence it follows that(cid:16)X , Λ1(cid:0)(E2n)(cid:1)(cid:17) ∈ T .

Now Theorem 11 of [17] implies that X satisﬁes the strong Ω
condition, ¯Ω, of Vogt. This together with our assumption that, X
has the property DN allows us to conclude that X is isomorphic to
a ﬁnite type power series space (Proposition 2.9.18 of [15]). Hence
X ∼= Λ1(E) (Proposition 1.1 of [5]).

4. Spaces of Analytic Functions

In this section we will focus our attention to a particular class of nu-
clear Fr´echet spaces with the properties DN and Ω, namely the spaces of
analytic functions on Stein manifolds. Stein manifolds, being closed con-
nected submanifolds of complex euclidean spaces CN , possess a rich supply
of analytic functions. These spaces, with the usual topology of uniform con-
vergence on compact subsets, form an important subclass of Fr´echet spaces
with the properties DN and Ω. The linear topological properties of O(M),
the Fr´echet space of analytical functions on a Stein manifold M, and the

18

AYDIN AYTUNA

complex analytic properties of M that are reﬂected on M by the type of
O(M), have been studied by several authors (see [3] [25] and the references
therein). In this context, we show, in subsection 4.1 that local imbedding of
ﬁnite type power series spaces into O(M) can be used to construct Green’s
functions in M. In subsection 4.2 we classify Stein manifolds M, for which
O(M) is tame. Some results and concepts from Pluripotential Theory will
be used in the sequel. For undeﬁned terminology and background in these
matters we refer the reader to [12].

4.1. Local imbeddings of ﬁnite type power series spaces into O(M)
and Green’s functions.

Let M be a complex manifold and ﬁx a point z0 ∈ M. We will use the
symbol P SH(M) to denote the set of all plurisubharmonic functions on M.
Employing norms in a local chart centered at z0 we consider

.
= {u ∈ P SH(M), u ≤ 0 and u(z) − ln kz − z0k is bounded near z0}

Lz0

and set

g(ξ, z0)

.
= sup{u(ξ) : u ∈ Lz0}.

This assignment, if not ≡ −∞, deﬁnes a plurisubharmonic function on M.
We will call g(·z0) the Green’s function of M with pole at z0, and say that
Green’s function with pole at z0 exists in case g(·, z0) is not identically equal
to −∞. If M is parabolic i.e. if it does not possess a nonconstant bounded
plurisubharmonic function then of course, no Green’s function exist. In one
variable nonparabolicity characterizes existence of Green’s functions, [19],
however in several complex variables there is no such general result. The
diﬃculty seems in constructing a negative plurisubharmonic function with
a pole at the given point from the class of negative plurisubharmonic func-
tions.

Proposition 4.1. Let M be a Stein manifold of dimension d and let z0 be
a point in M. If there exists a local imbedding from Λ1(α) into O(M), for
some ﬁnitely nuclear exponent sequence {αn}n, with lim n1/d/αn > 0, then
Green’s function with a pole at z0 exists.

Proof. Let us ﬁx M and the point z0. In view of [10] there exists a local
biomorphism Φ : ∆d
։ M, from the polydisc with centre 0 and radius
e
e of Cd onto M such that Φ(0) = z0. We will use Φ to imbed O(M) into
O(∆d
e) via the composition operator f 7→ f ◦ Φ, f ∈ O(M) ([6]). We will
choose a bijection ρ : N → Nd such that |ρ(n)| is strictly increasing with n
and is ordered lexicographic on the level sets of |ρ(·)|, and use it to deﬁne

an isomorphism between Λ1(n1/d) and O(∆d
e) by the correspondence ǫi →
zp(i) = zp1(i)

independent of r, and ξ ∈ ∆d

4.2. Diametral dimensions of analytic function spaces.

In this subsection we will investigate the diametral dimension of the
spaces of analytic functions on Stein manifolds. These invariants for Fr´echet
spaces are in a sense dual to approximate diametral dimensions, however
they are more extensively studied.

For a nuclear Fr´echet space X with a neighborhood basis of 0, {Up}∞

p=1,

consisting of discs, ∆(X ), is deﬁned by (in the notation of Section 1):

∆(X ) = {(tn); ∀p ∃q :

= {(tn); ∀p ∃q :

tndn(Uq, Up) → 0}.
tne−En(p,q) → 0}.

As the notation suggests, it is easy to see that, this sequence space does
not depend upon the neighborhood basis chosen and is an invariant of the
Fr´echet space X .

In this subsection we will use a spacial generating norm-system for the
analytic function spaces, unless stated otherwise. To describe these norms,
suppose a Stein manifold M of dimension d is given. We choose a strictly
plurisubharmonic C ∞ exhaustion function, ρ, of M and consider a sequence
.
= {z ∈ M; ρ(z) < rp}, p = 1, 2, . . . ,
rp ↑ ∞ such that the sub-level sets Dp
.
= ¯Dp, p = 1, 2, . . . . Following ([27],
are strictly pseudoconvex. We set Kp
c.f. [25]) we choose for each p, a Hilbert space, Hp, that satisﬁes;

A(Kp) ֒→ Hp ֒→ AC(Kp) ֒→ O(Dp)

where A(Kp) denotes the germs of analytic functions on the compact set Kp
with the inductive limit topology, AC(Kp) denotes the Banach space that
is the closure of A(Kp) in C(Kp), the Banach space of continuous functions
on Kp with the sup-norm, and the ֒→’s are imbeddings with dense range,
p = 1, 2, . . . . The norms that we will use to generate the topology O(M)
will be the hilbertian norms of Hp’s, {k kp}p. Their corresponding unit balls
in O(M) will be denoted by Up, p = 1, 2, . . . . The primary reason of our
usage of these semi-norms is because of the beautiful formula of Nivoche,
Poletsky, Zaharyuta:

sition 4.6, 4.8, 4.12 on [27]). We refer the reader to [27] and [25] for a proof
and a discussion about the history of this formula.
An immediate consequence of equation (4.3) is;

Now in view of the (2’) of Proposition 2.3 there exists a q+, C > 0
and 0 < λ < 1 such that;

En(p, q) ≤ (1 − λ)En(p, q+) + C.

For ε > 0 such that (1 + ε) < 1

choose k, 0 < ρ < 1 and C > 0 so that En(p, q) ≤ (1 −ρ)En(p, k) + C.
Let ε > 0 be so that 1 − ρ < 1 − ε and choose an N (from (4.3))

This contradiction shows that inf p supq≥p 1/c(p, q) = 0.

d )n, being the associated exponent sequence of
O(M), always satisﬁes ∆(Λ1(n

we have ∆(Λ1(n
d )) = ∆(O(M)). Since O(M) is isomorphic to a closed
subspace of Λ1(n1/d), the other equivalence directly follows from Proposition
2.7 and the fact that approximate diametral dimension of a nuclear Fr´echet
space is greater than the approximate diametral dimension of its subspaces
([7]).
(cid:3)

Theorem 4.4. Let M be a Stein manifold of dimension d. Then either
∆(O(M)) = ∆(O(∆d)) or ∆(O(M)) = ∆(O(Cd)).

Proof. Let us ﬁx a Stein manifold M with dimension d. We will use, in what
follows, the grading on O(M) described in the beginning of the section.
.
Using the notation above, for a given p ≥ 1, we set, c(p)
= limq>p c(p, q) =
inf q>p c(p, q). Since c(·, ·) is increasing in the ﬁrst variable, the sequence
{c(p)} is an increasing sequence. We have two cases:

1. c(p) is zero for all p ≥ 1. Suppose this is the case. Let us choose a
d )), and choose an R > 1 and C > 0,

(tn)n ∈ ∆(O(Cd)) = ∆(Λ∞(n

so that |tn| ≤ CRn
c(p, q) ≤ 1

ln( ˜R)

1

d , ∀n. For a given p let us choose a q such that

for some ˜R with R1/(2πd!)

1

d << ˜R. Then

|tn|e− αn

c(p,q) ≤ |tn|e−αn ln ˜R+n1/d ln R−n1/d ln R ≤ C.

So (tn)n ∈ ∆(O(M)) in view of Proposition 4.1. Hence

∆(Λ∞(n1/d)) ⊆ ∆(O(M)).

1

However, {n
d }n, being the associated exponent sequence of O(M),
the inclusion ∆(O(M)) ⊆ ∆(Λ∞(n1/d)) is always true. It follows
that in this case ∆(O(M)) = ∆(O(Cd)).

2. The sequence {c(p)} increases to a non-zero number c. Suppose this

is the case. We have two possibilities either c ∈ R or c = ∞.

Let us suppose that c > 0 is a real number. Fix natural num-
bers α < γ < β. For given natural numbers n and m, plainly
dn+m(Uβ, Uα) ≤ dn(Uβ, Uγ)dm(Uγ, Uα), where Ut’s, 1 ≤ t < ∞, are
the unit balls corresponding to our grading. In particular we have

(4.4)

En+m(α, β) ≥ En(γ, β) + Em(α, γ); n, m ≥ 1

Fix an ε > 0 and using (4.3), choose N = N(α, γ, β) such that

≤ En+m(α, β) ≤ (1 + ε)

≤ En(γ, β) ≤ (1 + ε)

for n, m ≥ N, taking m = n, and n > N, we get, after cancellation:

(1 − E)
c(α, γ)

+

(1 − E)
c(γ, β)

≤

(1 + E)21/d

c(α, β)

which upon letting ﬁrst β then γ and α to go to inﬁnity, respectively,
gives 2 ≤ 21/d. Hence for d > 1, c must be ∞.

For d = 1, we will use the exhaustion given in [1, p. 145] and
an associated fundamental hilbertian norm system as explained in
the beginning of the section. In this context we will use the modulus
inequality as given in [19, p. 14], which in our notation states that
for 1 ≤ p < q < s < ∞,

c(p, s)

c(p, q)

c(q, s)

TAMENESS IN THE FR ´ECHET SPACES OF ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS

First letting s → ∞ and then q → ∞ we see that 1/(c(q)) ap-
proaches to 0. Hence in this case we conclude that c = ∞, as well.
So the ﬁrst possibility does not occur and we conclude that

lim

The theorem now follows from Corollary 4.3.

(cid:3)

Now we turn our attention to tameness in the spaces of analytic func-
tions. Recall that a Stein manifold M is called hyperconvex in case it pos-
sesses a bounded plurisubharmonic exhaustion function. We refer the reader
to [12] and the references therein for an account of hyperconvex manifolds.
From a functional analysis point of view, hyperconvex Stein manifolds M
are precisely those Stein manifolds that satisfy, O(M) ≈ O(∆d), d = dimM,
([26, 2]). Hence for hyperconvex manifold M, O(M) is a tame Fr´echet space.
Our next and ﬁnal result tells us that they are the only ones having this
property:

Main Theorem 4.5. Let M be a Stein manifold. Then O(M) is tame if
and only if M is hyperconvex.

Proof. Let us ﬁx a Stein manifold M with dimension d. In view of the
remarks preceding the theorem, it suﬃces to show that if O(M) is tame then
O(M) ≈ O(∆d). In view of Theorem 4.4 either ∆(O(M)) = ∆(O(Cd)) or
∆(O(M)) = ∆(O(∆d)). The ﬁrst case cannot occur. To see this ﬁrst observe
that the assumption on the diametral dimension implies that O(M) contains
a complemented copy of O(Cd) by Theorem 1.3 of [4]. Since plainly tameness
passes to complemented subspaces and O(Cd) = Λ∞(n1/d) is not tame [9],
indeed this case cannot occur. Now the theorem follows from Corollary 4.3
and Theorem 3.2.
