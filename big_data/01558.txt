In this work we have used a Hoˇrava-Lifshitz scaling to rewrite a Lorentz-violating higher-order
derivative electrodynamics controlled by a background four-vector nµ. The photon propagator was
obtained and we have analyzed the dispersion relation and the observational results of gamma-
ray burst (GRB) experiments were used. The limits of the critical exponent were discussed in
the light of the GRB data and the physical implications were compared with the current GRB-
Lorentz-invariance-violation literature. We show that the bound for the Lorentz-violating coupling
for dimension-six operators, obtained from a Hoˇrava-Lifshitz scaling, is eight orders of magnitude
better than the result found without considering a Hoˇrava-Lifshitz scaling, also this bound is nearby
one, which is expected to be relevant phenomenologically.

INTRODUCTION

Lorentz symmetry is one of the cornerstones of the Standard Model which describes very precisely the properties
of elementary particles and interactions at energy scales below TeV, the energy scale attained by the Large Hadron
Collider. However, the idea that it can be violated at high energies, presumably at Planck energy scale, MP ≈
1.22 × 1019 GeV/c2, has been investigated in many areas of theoretical physics (see, for example, Ref.
[1] and
references therein).
In this manuscript, the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) is introduced through high-order
derivative operators which explicitly break Lorentz symmetry. These LIV terms are eﬀective at the ultraviolet (UV)
regime and they lead to modiﬁcations of dispersion relations for particles at high energies [2] (see also Ref. [3]).

The study of higher order derivatives in the scenario of the LIV eﬀective theory was initially proposed by Myers-
Pospelov by using mass operators of dimension-ﬁve along with a nondynamical four-vector nµ interacting with scalars,
fermions, and photons ﬁelds [2]. For the electromagnetic sector, their proposal reads:

SM P = −

ξ

MP Z d4x nαFαδnγ∂γnβ ˜F βδ,

ξ is a dimensionless parameter, α, β, γ, δ = 0, 1, 2, 3, Fαβ = ∂αAβ − ∂βAα and ˜F βδ = 1
2 εβδρσFρσ. One chooses the
background four-vector nµ as nµ = (n0 ≡ 1,~0) which leads to spatial anisotropy in space-time. Then, one integrates
by parts Eq.(1) and uses the Bianchi identities, ∂[αFβγ] = 0, to obtain:

As it can be inferred from Eq.(2) the Lorentz Invariance is broken around the scale MP, which may present
additional theoretical as well as observational challenges to such models. Moreover, this theory can present problems

associated with a non-renormalizable Lorentz-violating operator. Hence, in order to deal with this problem, one relies
on a very anisotropic scale between space and time, which is also known as Hoˇrava-Lifshitz ﬁeld theory [4, 5]. In this
approach, there is an explicit asymmetry between time and space coordinates so the Lorentz symmetry is broken.
This asymmetry is controlled by a critical exponent z, which is also dubbed as Lifshitz critical exponent.

The Hoˇrava-Lifshitz theory has also been proposed as an alternative for a UV-completion of general relativity [6].
It is known that general relativity is not a UV-renormalizable interaction as its coupling constant has the following
dimensions, [G] = [M ]−2, where [M ] denotes the mass unit. The main claim is that one can introduce an asymmetry
between space and time, in this case, the dimension of time is [t] = [L]z and the dimension of spatial coordinates is
[~r] = [L], where [L] denotes the length unit. The eﬀect of this asymmetry is the possibility of turning the coupling
constant dimensionless after choosing judiciously the value of the critical exponent z. This interaction, now, is
expected to be power countable UV-renormalizable. Indeed, in Ref. [6], it was shown that for z ≥ 3 is suﬃcient to
warrant the UV-renormalizability of general relativity. For z = 1, one recovers the usual Lorentz symmetry for the
low-energy limit. Above the energy scale ΛHL one expects to ﬁnd LIV terms and z 6= 1. In Ref.[7], it is argued that
ΛHL ≪ MP, which enhances the viability of observing experimentally LIV.
Our aim is to discuss the eﬀects of LIV that can phenomenologically emerge below some intermediate scale, ΛHL ∼
1010GeV, given by the process of separation between the Lifshitz-UV behavior and the eﬀects of large energy scale
(a discussion on the choice of scale for ΛHL is found, for example, at Ref.[7]).

In this paper, we take advantage of this procedure to rewrite the higher-derivative eﬀective action (2) as a function
of the Lifshitz critical exponent z. This aims to ﬁnd new phenomenological constraints on LIV (in the Lifshitz-UV
behavior) by using recent measures of the gamma-ray busts (GRB) polarization. Note that previous studies (to large
energy scales) apply certain corrections in the photons dispersion relations as a method to obtain constraints on
LIV from polarization measurement of GRB [8–10] (see speciﬁc discussion, e.g., [11–13]). Our goal is to revisit such
investigations by inﬂuence of Lifshitz-UV behavior.

This paper is organized as follows: in section II we have introduced the model and computed the photon propaga-
tor. In section III we have obtained the dispersion relation and used the results obtained by the gamma-ray burst
observations. The physical consequences were discussed. In section IV we have depicted the conclusions.

II. THE GAUGE-INVARIANT MODEL

Following the Ref.[7], a Horava-Lifshitz like modiﬁcation of the Maxwell sector can be written as

SM,HL = −

1

2 Z dtd3~x hF0iF 0i +

1
2

Fij(−∆)z−1)F iji,

(3)

where ∆ = −∂i∂i = ~∂ · ~∂, the metric used is diag (1,−1,−1,−1) and z is the Lifshitz critical exponent. For the
Hoˇrava-Lifshitz theory, in lenght units, one has [t] = [L]z, [~x] = [L], [∂t] = [L]−z and [∂i] = [L]−1. As the action is
dimensionless, one ﬁnds that [A0] = [L]− 1
2 (z−3). For z = 1 one recovers the usual action for the
free Maxwell ﬁeld, as expected.

2 (z+1) and [Ai] = [L]

To complete this model, a Hoˇrava-Lifshitz like version of the Myers-Pospelov LIV action, Eq.(2), is introduced:

SMP,HL = −

2MP Z dtd3~x εijkAi∂2

The Planck mass dimension is [MP] = [L]−z. Following the Ref.[5], one can rescale the dimensions as

A Hoˇrava-Lifshitz energy scale, ΛHL, which units are [ΛHL] = [L]−1, is deﬁned. After this procedure the quantities
has the familiar dimensions: [t] = [L], [∂t] = [A0] = [Ai] = [MP] = [L]−1. Applying Eq. (5) to Eq.(3) one ﬁnds

SM,HL = −

1

2 Z dtd3~xhF0iF 0i +

1

2Λ2(z−1)

HL

Fij (−∆)z−1F iji,

which is exactly the model investigated in Ref.[7]. After rescaling the variables, Eq.(4) reads:

SMP,HL = −

1

2 Z d4xh ξRHLP

(ΛHL)z εijkAk∂2

t (√−∆)z−1Fiji,

(6)

(7)

where RHLP = ΛHL
is the ratio between the Hoˇrava-Lifshitz cross-over scale ΛHL and the Planck scale MP. This ratio
MP
can be considered very small (RHLP ∼ 10−9), providing a novel way of explicitly breaking supersymmetry without
reintroducing ﬁne-tuning [7] (see also, Ref.[15]).
Now, the construction of the model used can be ﬁnished. The action of our model which has both Hoˇrava-Lifshitz

scaling and LIV terms is

Notice that at ξ → 0, we recover a Lifshitz-type gauge invariant electrodynamics [7].

A. Proof of gauge invariance of our model

The gauge invariance of our model, Eq.(8), can be examined similarly to Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism in
i + ∂iϕ to rewrite the

Lifshitz gravity [7, 14]. We consider the following decomposition of the ﬁelds: A0 and Ai = AT
action (8) as,

S =

which makes explicit the following gauge symmetry: A0 → A′
symmetry: Aµ → A′

µ = Aµ + ∂µω.

0 = A0 + ˙ω, ϕ → ϕ′ = ϕ − ω, such as the usual gauge

In this point, we derive the photon propagator associated with the action (8) after the inclusion of the following

gauge ﬁxing term:

Thus, we choose the gauge condition A0 = 0 [7] to rewrite the Lagrangian as

Notice that the Feynman propagator resulting from the inversion is

It is interesting to realize that when z = 1 we have that the Eqs.(13) and (14) just recover the time-like background
propagator connected to electromagnetic Myers-Pospelov Lagrangian in the Coulomb gauge [16]. The unitarity of the
theory has been studied from the implementation of a physical cut-oﬀ both for the electron-positron scattering [17]
and tree level [18].

III. DISPERSION RELATION AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL ASPECTS

The dispersion relation is obtained from ˆD(k) = 0 in Eq.(14):

(15)

In order to derive a set of constraints on LIV from the vacuum birefringence eﬀects by using speciﬁc observations

of gamma-ray bursts, one has to solve the above dispersion relation to obtain the frequency solutions

kz

ωλ =

Λ(z−1)
HL p1 − 2λξRHLP(ΛHL)−zkz

(16)

with the two polarizations λ = ±. Notice that the solutions correctly reproduces the usual ones in the limit ξ → 0 at
z = 1. For ξ 6= 0 at z = 1, we have solutions associated with the eﬀects produced by dimension-ﬁve operators [2] (see
also Ref. [17]).
Now we will carry out an expansion of the Eq.(16) from the use of the following condition: kz ≪ 1/2ξRHLP(ΛHL)−z.

This leads to

ωλ ≈

kz

(ΛHL)z−1 +

λ(ξRHLP)k2z
(ΛHL)2z−1 ,

which can be considered approximated solutions associated with the following modiﬁed dispersion relation:

ω2 −

k2z

(ΛHL)2(z−1) −

2λ(ξRHLP)
(ΛHL)3z−2 k3z = 0.

(17)

(18)

For z = 1, we recover the cubic modiﬁcations reported in Ref.[2]. And, for z > 1 we ﬁnd new expressions due to the
direct inﬂuence of Lifshitz critical exponent.

Notice that the solutions (17) can be decomposed into two sectors: ω(k) → ωnb(k) + ωb±(k), a nonbirefringent

(ωnb(k)) and another birefringent (ωb±(k)). The nonbirefringent sector is given by

ωnb(k) = −k +

kz

(ΛHL)z−1 .

(19)

For z = 1 such nonbirefringent quantity disappears. However to z > 1, the dispersion relation can be associated with
a speciﬁc model which breaks the gauge invariance (see, e.g., [7] ). The birefringent sector can be written in the form

ωb±(k) = k ±

(ξRHLP)k2z
(ΛHL)2z−1 ,

(20)

which leads to a rotation of the polarization during the propagation of linearly polarized photons. For Lifshitz critical
exponent z = 1, we found the correction of order ξ(MP)−1k2 connected to operators of dimension-ﬁve. And, to z = 2
we found the correction of order (ξRHLP)(ΛHL)−3k4 associated with operators of dimension-seven. Moreover, if we
consider an intermediate critical exponent z = 3/2, we found the correction of order (ξRHLP)(ΛHL)−2k3 associated
with operators of dimension-six.

B. Constraints on LIV and gamma-ray burst

The vacuum birefringence is an important eﬀect to obtain bounds on LIV parameters [1]. Thus, assuming the
dispersion relation given in Eq.(20), one ﬁnds that the direction of polarization rotates during propagation along a
distance d and is given by

∆θ(d) = (cid:0)ωb+ (k) − ωb−(k)(cid:1)d

2

ξ
2

(RHLP)k2z d
(ΛHL)2z−1 .

≈

(21)

The above expression relates the degree of radiation polarized with phenomenon of birefringence. Consequently, the
parameter which control the LIV is given as

5

2∆θ

d

ξ ≈

(MP)2z−1
2 − k2z
(cid:0)k2z

1 (cid:1)(cid:0)RHLP(cid:1)2(z−1)

.

(22)

Now we are able to impose the upper bound for the ξ−LIV parameter at Lifshitz point. To this, we use the recent
determinations of the distance of the gamma-ray burst GRB 041219A, for which a high degree of polarization is
observed in the prompt emission. More informations see the detections derived in real time by the INTEGRAL Burst
Alert System (IBIS) [19–21].

The measurement values to be used are the following: ∆θ(d) = 47◦ to degree of polarization derived from the
measures made along the burst duration and d = 85 Mpc = 2.6 × 1026cm to lower limit luminosity distance (corre-
sponding to a redshift of zred = 0.02) [11, 12]. We also consider, LP l ≈ 1.62 × 10−33cm as the Planck length and
MP ≈ 1.22 × 1019GeV as the Planck energy so that as a convenience, we can rewrite the limit luminosity distance as
d = 85 Mpc = 1.61 × 1059(MP)−1. Thus, we can determine an upper limit to the LIV eﬀect as being

ξ <

1.02 × 10−59M 2z

P

2 − k2z
(k2z
1 )

(cid:0)RHLP(cid:1)2(z−1)

.

(23)

In this point, we assume the following values to the energies: k1 ∼ 100KeV ∼ 1 × 10−4GeV ∼ 0.81 × 10−23MP,
k2 ∼ 350KeV ∼ 3.5 × 10−4GeV ∼ 2.9 × 10−23MP. Thus, as we have assumed that RHLP ∼ 10−9, Eq.(23) is written
as:

which corresponds to an anisotropic upper-limit directly controlled by the Lifshitz critical exponent.

ξ(z) .

1.02 × 1028z−41
(cid:0)(2.9)2z − (0.81)2z(cid:1)

(24)

To discuss the constraints brought by LIV we have plotted in Fig. 1, the Eq.(24) as a function of the critical
expoenent[23] z. Notice that for z = 1, a dimension-ﬁve operator, we ﬁnd ξz=1 . 10−14, recovering the result

FIG. 1: The behavior of constraints on LIV for the following values: z = 1, z = 3/2 and z = 2 respectively.

obtained in [12]. It is a very strict bound which may point to the non-existence of these kind of terms in a LIV action,
or to the presence of some symmetry (maybe supersymmetry) acting to vanish this contribution of these operators.
These conclusions were already discussed in Ref. [12].

For a dimension-six operator, z = 3

2 , one ﬁnds that ξz= 3

. 0.43. If the Hoˇrava-Lifshitz scaling is absent, the bound
found in Ref.[12] is ξ . 2.61 × 108, this limit is too high to constrain any relevant ξ, which is expected to be nearby
one. Notice, that not only the introduction of Hoˇrava-Lifshitz anisotropic scaling improves the former result by eight
orders of magnitude, but also the bound found is almost of order one, where we hope to ﬁnd a relevant LIV eﬀect.
Notice that at z > 3
2 , one ﬁnds that the limits found do not put any realistic restriction to the value of ξ since, e.g.,

a simple generalization of the angle polarization given as [12],

Let us now discuss our phenomenological analysis by comparing with other studies of literature. We can consider

∆θ(d) ≈

˜ξ

(25)

6

where n = 2, 3, ..., represents the order of operator. Now for the sake of comparison with the Eq. (21) we introduce
the following relationship

ξ
˜ξ

=

kn−2z
RHLP

(ΛHL)2z−1

M n−1

Pl

.

(26)

Therefore, for operators of dimension-ﬁve (n = 2 and z = 1) we ﬁnd ξ = ˜ξ, whereas for operators of dimension-six
(n = 3 and z = 3/2) we ﬁnd ξ = (RHLP) ˜ξ. This means that the Lifshitz scaling of LIV high derivative operator, i.e.,
z > 1, also rescales (by factor 109) some phenomenological limits obtained by the usual model.

C. Time delay of two photons

Besides the phenomenological analyses considered above, at this point, we shall focus our attention on the time
delay between two distinct photon ﬂights. Such a delay has fundamental origin on the cosmological expansion itself
and due to non-trivial dispersion relations. Since in our theory we have a modiﬁed dispersion relation it is interesting
to address this issue as follows.

The dispersion relation (20) leads to a modiﬁed speed of light for a photon with momentum k:

Thus, the time delay between two photons with energy diﬀerence (for spatially ﬂat Universe Ωk = 0) is given as

vg =

dωb±

where H0 = 70 km s−1Mpc−1 is the Hubble constant (H −1

where ξ(z) is deﬁned in Eq. (24). For z = 1, z = 3/2 and z = 2, we ﬁnd respectively the time delay ∆t . 4.7× 10−21 s,
∆t . 8.7 × 10−21 s and ∆t . 1.24 × 10−20 s. In summary, these results show that contrary to the LIV parameter ξ(z),
the time delay is not much sensitive with respect to the critical exponent z.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have analyzed the LIV of a Lifshitz-scaling to a Maxwell-Myers-Pospelov model where the Lifshitz-
type gauge invariant electrodynamics can be recovered. The photon propagator was computed, the dispersion relations
were derived and the frequency solutions for the two polarizations were obtained. Also, a vacuum birefringence analysis
was carried out.

Finally, we have obtained upper bounds for the ξ-LIV parameter for any Lifshitz critical exponent related to our
model. These limits were determined using the observational results of the gamma-ray burst GRB 041219A. For
z = 1, which corresponds to the usual dimensional-ﬁve operators, we found the same results already obtained in the
literature. This presumably shows either that these type operators are absent in a LIV action, or there is a symmetry
that vanishes their contributions in a LIV action. For z = 3
2 , which is related to dimension-six operators, it was
shown that the bound for ξ was improved in eight orders of magnitude from the same result where the Hoˇrava-Lifshitz
scaling is absent. Finally, we found that this bound is nearby one, which can be relevant from phenomenological point
of view. For higher-dimensional operators, z > 3
2 , the bounds obtained do not really restrict any of the couplings
ξz> 3
