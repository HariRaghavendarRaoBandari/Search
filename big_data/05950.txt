Abstract

We investigate the poles of the retarded Green’s functions of strongly coupled ﬁeld theories

exhibiting a variety of phase structures from a crossover up to diﬀerent ﬁrst order phase transitions.

These theories are modeled by a dual gravitational description. The poles of the holographic

Green’s functions appear at the frequencies of the quasinormal modes of the dual black hole

background. We focus on quantifying linearized level dynamical response of the system in the

critical region of phase diagram. Generically non-hydrodynamic degrees of freedom dominate

the low energy physics, and in some cases degeneracy of hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic

modes is found.

It is almost twenty years since there has been discovered a remarkable new relation between

geometry and physics: within the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspon-

dence [1] we can investigate the dynamics of strongly coupled quantum ﬁeld theories by means

of General Relativity methods. From purely academic studies this ﬁeld of research evolved to

address experimental systems an example being strongly interacting hadronic matter [2]. In

particular, real time response of a thermal equilibrium state has been quantiﬁed in the case of
N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory by the means of the poles of the retarded Green’s function [3],
which correspond to quasinormal modes (QNM) in the dual gravitational theory.

While the hydrodynamic QNMs have been studied in diﬀerent gravitational theories dual

to non-CFT cases (e.g. ref.

[4, 5]), initial steps towards extension were taken in ref.

[6, 7]

2

where nonhydrodynamic QNM’s of an external scalar ﬁeld were considered in non-conformal ﬁeld

theories, which still admit a gravitational dual description. Subsequent investigations include

diﬀerent mechanisms of scale generation [8], diﬀerent relaxation channels [9, 10], baryon rich

plasma [11], and studies of non-relativistic systems [12].

This paper is an extended version of the letter [13] where we provide many more details

as well as extend the investigation to a model of an improved holographic QCD type which

exhibits novel and interesting phenomena. We concentrate on investigating linearized real time

response of strongly coupled non-conformal ﬁeld theories in the vicinity of various types of phase

transitions and phase structures. Thus the physical regime of interest in the present paper is

quite distinct from the the one of interest for ‘early thermalization’ which have been extensively

studied within the AdS/CFT correspondence.

Firstly, we analyze all allowed channels of energy-momentum tensor perturbations and

corresponding two-point correlation functions. Secondly, we concentrate on the phenomena

appearing in the vicinity of a nontrivial phase structure of various type: a crossover (motivated

by the lattice QCD equations of state [14]), a 2nd order phase transition and a 1st order phase

transition. These cases are modeled by choosing appropriate scalar ﬁeld self-interaction potentials

in a holographic gravity-scalar theory used in [15]. Apart form this, we also analyze a potential

from a diﬀerent family of models, improved holographic QCD (IHQCD), considered in [16, 17].

In this case the focus was on getting best possible contact with properties of QCD, in particular

asymptotic freedom and colour conﬁnement as well as obtaining a realistic value of the bulk

viscosity.

Despite the fact, that considered models have a rather simplistic construction, the resulting

near equilibrium response shows a variety of non-trivial phenomena. Some generic features

consist of: (i) the breakdown of the applicability of a hydrodynamic description already at lower

momenta than in the conformal case; (ii) in the cases with a ﬁrst order phase transition we

ﬁnd a generic minimal temperature, Tm, below which no unstable solution exists; (iii) whenever

there exists a thermodynamical instability there is a corresponding dynamical instability present

in the hydrodynamic mode of the theory; (iv) the ultralocality property of non-hydrodynamic

modes, i.e., weak dependence on the momentum scale.

The nature of the dual gravitational formulation allows for a detailed quantitative investigation

of the above phenomena as well as for accessing diverse physical scenarios. In particular, the

ﬁrst order phase transition appears in two diﬀerent scenarios. The ﬁrst one is similar to the

usual Hawking-Page transition [18] in which the two phases are a black hole geometry and a

thermal gas geometry [17]. In the second one the transition appears between two black hole

3

solutions [15]. This diversity is triggered by a diﬀerent functional dependence of the scalar ﬁeld

potential in the deep infrared (IR) region, and is reﬂected in the corresponding QNM spectrum.

Nevertheless there is a common aspect in both situations. We observe some speciﬁc dynamical

response of the system for a characteristic temperature, Tch > Tm, in the stable branch of EoS.

The details of this eﬀect depend on the case, but the existence of Tch is generic for a ﬁrst order

phase transition.

Particularly interesting eﬀects appear in IHQCD model, which admits a ﬁrst order phase

transition between a black hole and a thermal gas [17]. First, for temperatures in the range
Tm ≤ T ≤ Tch the lowest lying excitation modes become purely imaginary for low momenta,
which leads to a ultralocality violation. Second, at T = Tm for momenta higher than some

threshold value the hydrodynamic mode and the ﬁrst non-hydrodynamic mode have the same

dispersion relation. Third, in the small black hole branch there is a range of temperatures which

shows instability in a non-hydro mode. The appearance of these phenomena makes the IHQCD

model unique in the landscape considered.

The organization of the paper is as follows.

In the next section, 2 we shortly describe

the thermodynamics of considered models and parameter choices for bulk scalar interactions.

In section 3 we discuss equations of motion for the linear perturbations of the background

and technical aspects of their solutions. In the ﬁrst subsection we clarify the right boundary

conditions which have to be chosen for the QNM spectrum. In the second subsection we give

general remarks and list main aspects of physical properties we obtain. The following sections 4

to 7 contain results and detailed studies of diﬀerent cases. We close the paper by a summary and

outlook in section 8. For completeness appendixes A and B respectively contain some technical

details of the Free Energy computation, and the explicit form of the QNM equations of motion.

2 The background and thermodynamics of the sys-

tem

In this section we formulate the background black hole solutions and determine the scalar ﬁeld

potential by considering emergent equations of state in the dual ﬁeld theory.

2.1 Metric Ansatz and equations of motion

This section describes the black hole background solutions for the quasinormal mode calculations,

which follow from the action

where V (φ) is thus far arbitrary and κ5 is related to ﬁve dimensional Newton constant by

κ5 =

8πG5. The last term in (1) is the standard Gibbons-Hawking boundary contribution.

These solutions are similar to those studied in ref. [15, 16]. Since our goal is to determine the

QNM frequencies, it will be convenient to employ Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, which have

been proven useful in the case of the scalar ﬁeld modes [6]. We will discuss this in a more detail

in the following section.

Whereas we are interested in asymptotically AdS space-time geometry, the potential needs

to have the following small φ expansion

V (φ) ∼ − 12

L2 +

1
2

m2φ2 + O(φ4) .

(2)

Here, L is the AdS radius, which we set it to one, L = 1, by the freedom of the choice of units.

Such a gravity dual corresponds to relevant deformations of the boundary conformal ﬁeld theory

L = LCFT + Λ4−∆Oφ ,

(3)

where Λ is an energy scale, and ∆ is a conformal dimension of the operator Oφ related to the mass
parameter of the scalar ﬁeld according to holography, ∆(∆ − 4) = m2. We consider 2 ≤ ∆ < 4
which corresponds to relevant deformations of the CFT and satisﬁes the Breitenlohner- Freedman
bound, m2 ≥ −4 [19, 20].

The Ansatz for solutions under considerations follows from the assumed symmetries: transla-

tion invariance in the Minkowski directions as well as SO(3) rotation symmetry in the spatial

part. This leads to the following form of the line element:

ds2 = gttdt2 + gxxd(cid:126)x2 + grrdr2 + 2grtdrdt ,

(4)

where all the metric coeﬃcients appearing in (4) are functions of the radial coordinate r alone,

as is the scalar ﬁeld φ. This form of the ﬁeld Ansatz (determined so far only by the assumed

symmetries) allows two gauge choices to be made. For the purpose of computing the quasinormal

modes it is very convenient to use the Eddington-Finkelstein gauge grr = 0. It is typically

convenient also to impose the gauge choice gtr = 1, but for our purposes it turns out to be very

5

eﬀective to use the remaining gauge freedom to set φ = r. We label the metric components as

ds2 = e2A (−h dt2 + d(cid:126)x2) − 2 eA+B dt dr ,

φ = r .

where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to φ.

In contrast to methods proposed in ref. [15] we solve this coupled equations directly using

the spectral method [21] in the Newton linearization algorithm. We are interested in solutions

possessing a horizon, which requires that the blackening function h(r) should have a zero at

some r = rH :

h(rH ) = 0 .

(13)

Asymptotically we require that our geometry is that of the AdS space-time.

2.2 Thermodynamics

Having determined the geometry we can extract the thermodynamic quantities in a standard

way. The Beckenstein-Hawking formula for entropy, together with the event horizon regularity,

lead to the following expressions for the entropy density and the Hawking temperature

s =

2π
κ2
5

e3A(rH ) ,

T =

eA(rH )+B(rH )|V (cid:48)(rH )|

4π

.

(14)

In turn, the speed of sound of the system can be determined as

c2
s =

d log T
d log s

.

6

(15)

Let us emphasis that this is the speed of sound in the dual ﬁeld theory. The corresponding Free

Energy (FE) is related to the value of the action evaluated at the solution [22]

βF = lim
→0

(S() − Sct()) ,

(16)

where β = 1/T , S is the Einstein-Hilbert-scalar action (with Gibbons-Hawking term) evaluated

on-shell with a cut-oﬀ  in a holographic direction. Sct are properly chosen counter-terms. We

will use this formula in the case of potentials with a ﬁrst order phase transition in order to

compute the Free Energy diﬀerence between phases as a function of temperature and determine

the critical temperature, Tc, for those models. In evaluating this diﬀerence the counter-terms

will cancel that is why we do not need to have a detailed knowledge thereof.

The way in which conformal symmetry is broken is determined by the choice of the scalar

ﬁeld potential which in our case is taken in a generic form [15, 16]

V (φ) = −12 (1 + a φ2)1/4 cosh(γ φ) + b2 φ2 + b4 φ4 + b6 φ6.

(17)

The chosen potentials are summarized in table 1. Corresponding plots, representing temperature

dependence of the entropy density, i.e., the equation of state (EoS), will be given together with

the detailed discussion of each case in following sections. Here we only make a few general

remarks. The parameters for the VQCD potential have been chosen to ﬁt the lattice QCD (lQCD)

data from ref. [14], and the system is known to possess a crossover behaviour at zero baryon

charge density. Parameters of potentials V1st and V2nd were ﬁtted so that the corresponding
equations of state exhibit respectively the 1st , and the 2nd order phase transitions. In particular,

for the 1st order case, in a certain temperature range we expect an instability (spinodal) region.

The last potential (the one for which a = 1) is referred to as IHQCD [16, 17], but ﬁrst

appeared in [31]. It was found in the studies of dilatonic deformations of the original AdS/CFT

correspondence. As it was mentioned in the introduction, and will be extended in section 7, it is

designed to mimic dynamical aspects of QCD.

The models determined by the potentials V1st and VIHQCD exhibit a ﬁrst order phase

transitions. In the former case the transition happens between two diﬀerent black hole solutions,

while in the latter the transition happens between a black hole and a horizon-less geometry. In

both of those cases one can determine the transition by evaluating the FE diﬀerence according

to formula (16), if one knows the counter terms 1. In this computation we follow an alternative
method of ref. [16] and integrate the thermodynamic relation, dF = −s dT , with properly chosen
boundary condition. We can achieve this by ﬁrst choosing some arbitrary reference temperature

1Clariﬁcation of this point can be found in the appendix A.

where we assume to be in one particular class of solutions. To evaluate the integration constant,
F(T0), we use the fact that the Free Energy vanishes for the zero horizon area geometry. In
general the small horizon area limit of the black hole solutions corresponds to the vacuum

geometry with ”good singularity” in the deep IR [23]. By using the relation of T and s and

the horizon radius (14) we can evaluate the Free Energy with the data obtained with methods

3 Quasinormal modes

In this section we formulate the problem of analyzing the linear perturbations around the

equilibrium states in considered models. The ﬁrst subsection contains equations of motion and

proper boundary conditions that need to be imposed. The second subsection contains a short

summary of the results obtained with an emphasis on generic aspects. The detailed case by case

discussion is a subject of the remaining part of the paper.

3.1

Equations of motion and boundary conditions

The linear response of the system is analyzed by setting perturbations with momentum in a given

direction and computing poles of the resulting Green functions. In this section we formulate

8

the equations and corresponding boundary conditions to present and discuss the results in the

following part of the paper.

We consider perturbations of the background, obtained in the previous section, in the

following form

ab (r) + hab(r)e−iωt+ikz ,

gab(r, t, z) = g(0)
φ(r, t, z) = r + ψ(r)e−iωt+ikz .

(20)

(21)

On the basis of [3, 4, 6] we consider inﬁnitesimal diﬀeomorphism transformations, xa (cid:55)→ xa + ξa,
of the form ξa = ξa(r)e−iωt+ikz, which act on the perturbations in a standard way,

gab (cid:55)→ gab − ∇aξb − ∇bξa ,

φ (cid:55)→ φ − ξa∇aφ ,

(22)

and look for linear combinations of metric and scalar perturbations which are invariant under

those transformations. There are four such modes, two of which are decoupled and two coupled.

Written explicitly, the coupled modes read

+ k2h(r) − ω2

+ k2h(r)Htt(r) + ω(2kHtz(r) + ωHzz(r)) ,

(23)

(cid:18) k2h(cid:48)(r)

2A(cid:48)(r)

(cid:19)

Z1(r) = Haa(r)

and

Z2(r) = ψ(r) − Haa(r)
2A(cid:48)(r)

.

(24)

In the above haa(r) = hxx(r) = hyy(r) are transverse metric components and we have factorized
the background from the metric perturbations in the following way: htt(r) = h(r)e2A(r)Htt(r),
htz(r) = e2A(r)Htz(r), haa(r) = e2A(r)Haa(r), hzz(r) = e2A(r)Hzz(r). Comparing with equation

(3.12) of ref. [3] we can see that Z1(r) mode corresponds to the sound mode, while the Z2(r)

might be called a non-conformal mode, since it is intimately related to the scalar ﬁeld. The

third mode (which is decoupled) is the shear one and is expressed as

Z3(r) = Hxz(r) +

ω
k

Hxt(r) ,

(25)

and according to the residual SO(2) symmetry in xy-plane (after turning on momentum along

z-direction) is degenerated with the mode in which the index x is replaced by the index y. The

dynamics of the fourth mode,

Z4(r) = Hxy(r) ,

(26)

is governed by an equation of motion which is similar to the external massless scalar equation,

which was studied in with details in [6].

9

The equations of motion for the modes Z1(r) and Z2(r) have the generic form

M2(r)Z(cid:48)(cid:48)
N2(r)Z(cid:48)(cid:48)

1 (r) + M1(r)Z(cid:48)
2 (r) + N1(r)Z(cid:48)

1(r) + M0(r)Z1(r) + K0(r)Z2(r) = 0 ,
2(r) + N0(r)Z2(r) + L1(r)Z(cid:48)

1(r) + L0(r)Z1(r) = 0 ,

(27)

(28)

and have to be solved numerically with proper boundary conditions. The explicit form of the

coeﬃcient functions and comments about the numerics are given in the appendix B. As usual at

the horizon we take the incoming condition, which in our coordinates means the regular solution.

An analysis of the equations (27) and (28) near the conformal boundary leads to the

asymptotic behavior as r ∼ 0

Z1(r) ∼ A1 + B1 r

4

4−∆ ,

Z2(r) ∼ A2 r + B2 r

∆

4−∆ .

(29)

Transformation to the usual Feﬀerman-Graham coordinates close to the boundary, r1/(4−∆) (cid:55)→ ρ,
reveals that Z1(ρ) has the asymptotic of metric components like the perturbations considered in

[3]. This perturbation corresponds to the sound mode of the theory. On the other hand Z2(ρ)

has the asymptotic of the background scalar ﬁeld φ and is similar to the case studied in [4].

The right boundary conditions for the QNM spectrum are: A1 = 0 and A2 = 0. The shear

mode perturbation Z3(r) has the same asymptotic as Z1(r) and requires a standard Dirichlet

boundary condition at r = 0.

3.2 General remarks and summary

In all the cases the problem emerging from equations disused in the previous section is a

generalized eigenvalue equation, which for a given k results in a well deﬁned frequency ω(k).
Note that all modes, for which Re ω(k) (cid:54)= 0, come in pairs, namely

ω(k) = ±|Re ω(k)| + i Im ω(k).

(30)

As we will show in the next section in some cases the modes are purely imaginary. But we want

to emphasize that in all of these cases (except the hydrodynamical shear mode) still we have pair

modes with diﬀerent values. An important thing to note here is that due to the coupled nature

of the modes Z1(r) and Z2(r) there is another approximate degeneracy in the spectrum: all

modes, except for the hydrodynamical one, come in pairs. The reader is alerted not to confuse

this structure with the one appearing in eq. (30).

For all the potentials we have made natural consistency checks. For high temperatures (i.e.,

horizon radii closer to the asymptotic boundary) in the sound and the shear channels we have

an agreement with the pure gravity results dual to the CFT case [3]. The degeneracy related

10

to the coupled nature of the modes is still present at high temperatures, where the system is

expected to be conformal. The second most damped nonhydrodynamic mode turns out to be

the most damped nonhydrodynamic mode found in ref. [3]

The hydrodynamical QNM’s are deﬁned by the condition limk→0 ωH (k) = 0, and are related

to transport coeﬃcients in the following way

ω ≈ −i

η

k2 ,

ω ≈ ± cs k − i Γs k2 ,

(31)

respectively in the shear and sound channels. Those formulas are approximate in a sense that

in general higher order transport coeﬃcients should be considered [24]. However, in a range of

small momenta, second order expansion is enough and we use it to read oﬀ the lowest transport

coeﬃcients of the model. The sound attenuation constant, Γs, is related to shear η and bulk ζ

(32)

Those formulas were used to make the second check of the results: compute the speed of sound cs

and values of the shear viscosity from the hydrodynamic modes and compare them respectively to

the one obtained from the background calculations (15) and predictions known in the literature

[25, 26]. Both of them are always satisﬁed, for example the classical result, η/s = 1/(4π) [25], is

found in all cases considered in this paper.

In the analysis below we measure the momenta and the frequencies in the units of temperature

by setting

q =

k

2πT

,

 =

ω
2πT

.

(33)

There are a few novel predictions which we make from the QNM frequencies. First is to estimate

the momentum, or equivalently the length, scale where the hydrodynamic description of the

system breaks. For a CFT case this was evaluated to be q = 1.3 where in the shear channel ﬁrst

non-hydrodynamic QNM dominated the system dynamics [27]. In the same time this eﬀect did

not appear in the CFT sound channel. The new feature we ﬁnd is that we see this crossing2

not only in the shear channel but also in the sound channel. This shows that the inﬂuence of

a non-trivial phase structure of the background aﬀects the applicability of hydrodynamics in

a qualitative way. Other aspect is that the hydrodynamic description is valid in large enough

length scale (the smaller critical momentum) which means the applicability of hydrodynamics

near the phase transition is more restricted than in the high temperature case.

2In this paper by crossing between the modes we mean crossing in the imaginary part of the hydrodynamic and the

most damped non-hydrodynamic modes.

11

In table 2 we summarize the critical momenta in two channels and hydrodynamic parameters

for diﬀerent potentials. All quantities are evaluated at corresponding critical temperatures. In

the following subsections we will show the QNM’s mostly for the sound channel which present

characteristic structure for each potential. Since the shear channel in all cases has the same form

(with diﬀerent critical momentum) we restrict ourselves to show only one related plot for the

VQCD potential.

Values given at corresponding critical temperatures (Tm for V1st and VIHQCD).

The second observation is the bubble formation in the spinodal region in the case of the 1st

order phase transition [28]. This happens when c2
s < 0 which means that hydrodynamical mode
is purely imaginary. For small momenta, ωH = ±i|cs|k − iΓsk2, the mode with the plus sign is
in the unstable region, i.e., Im ωH > 0. For larger momenta the other term starts to dominate,
so that there is kmax = |cs|/Γs for which the hydro mode becomes stable again. The scale of
the bubble is the momentum for which positive imaginary part of the hydro mode attains the

maximal value. Imaginary part of the unstable hydro mode is called the growth rate [28].

Third observation is that the hydrodynamical mode of the sound channel in 1st order case

near the critical temperature Tc, and in the IHQCD case also the ﬁrst non-hydrodynamical

modes, become purely imaginary for a range of momenta. Interpretation of this fact is that the

corresponding wavelengths cannot propagate at a linearized level and correspondingly there is a

diﬀusion-like mechanism for those modes.

It is important to note that generically the ultra-locality [6] of the non-hydrodynamic mode

is still present in the critical region of the phase diagram. The only exception observed is the

IHQCD potential, where the modes exhibit a non trivial behaviour. Most of the interesting

dynamics and eﬀects observed are due to the diﬀerent behaviour of the hydrodynamical modes

and how they cross the most damped non-hydrodynamic modes. This includes the instability

and the bubble formation in the case of the 1st order phase transition.

4 The crossover case

The results for the QNM with a QCD-like equations of state are summarized below. Parameters

of this potential have been chosen to ﬁt the temperature dependence of the speed of sound

obtained in lattice QCD computations with dynamical quarks at zero baryon chemical potential

[14].

In our computations from the hydrodynamic mode we estimate the value of the bulk viscosity,

which is in agreement with ref. [31] (cf. tab. 2). It is important to note, that despite the fact

that the EoS of QCD are correctly reproduced in the model transport coeﬃcients are lower than

the lattice predictions [29, 30]. For example only the qualitative temperature dependence of
bulk viscosity is correct, namely that it rapidly raises near the Tc [31].3

In this analysis we take another step, and study the temperature and momentum behaviour

not only of the hydrodynamic mode but also of the ﬁrst and second of the inﬁnite tower of

higher modes. In particular this allows us to estimate the applicability of the hydrodynamic

approximation in the critical region of temperatures where we ﬁnd crossing of the modes in

sound channel.

Firstly, before we move to the new results, using the example of the VQCD potential, let us

discuss the high temperature quasinormal modes. The results computed for T = 3Tc are shown

in ﬁg. 14. The speed of sound, shear and bulk viscosities read of from the lowest QNM are very

Modes computed for this temperature in the sound and the shear channels are in agreement

with the conformal results of ref. [3]. As we mentioned in previous section, since Z1(r) and Z2(r)

modes are coupled the nonhydrodynamic QNM’s are in pair in all range of temperatures, and

the second most damped nonhydrodynamic mode turns out to be the most damped one found

in ref. [3].

Figure 3: The real (left) and imaginary (right) parts of the quasinormal modes in the sound

channel for the potential VQCD at T = Tc.

Now let us turn our attention to the opposite case of lower temperatures. The results

computed for the pseudo-critical temperature, T = Tc, are shown in ﬁg. 3. The most important

diﬀerence with respect to high-T case a change in large momentum dependence of the imaginary

part of the hydrodynamic mode. Instead of approaching some constant value the imaginary

part of the mode ﬂows to minus inﬁnity as momentum increases. This implies a novel eﬀect in

the sound channel: crossing between the hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic mode appears.

While in the
conformal case this was present only in the shear channel for qc (cid:39) 1.3 [27], as shown in ﬁgure 4
for the crossover potential qc (cid:39) 1.15 in the same channel. In contrast, nonhydrodynamic modes
are not much aﬀected obeying ultra locality property [6].

Figure 4: The real (left) and imaginary (right) parts of the quasinormal modes in the shear

channel for the potential VQCD at T = Tc.

In view of possible relations to QCD we could expect only qualitative predictions from our

computations. However, lattice QCD computations could, in principle, verify the ultra-locality

property and the generic crossing of the modes. The main obstruction in this case would be the

necessity of real time formulation of the problem, which is not yet available on the lattice.

5 The second order phase transition case

In this section we present results for the case of a system with 2nd phase transition EoS, which

can be achieved by a suitable choice of parameters. We do not ﬁt to any particular system

considered in the literature - we only require a particular shape of the entropy as a function

of temperature (cf. left panel of ﬁg. 5) which leads to vanishing speed of sound at the critical

temperature T = Tc [15]. Near the Tc entropy of the system takes the form

s(T ) ∼ s0 + s1t1−α ,

(34)

where t = (T − Tc)/Tc, and α (cid:39) 0.65 is the speciﬁc heat critical exponent (cf. right panel of ﬁg.
5). This value is very close to α = 2/3 from ref. [15].

The results for QNM at critical temperature are displayed in ﬁg. 6. Since there is no new

phenomena in the shear channel, only the sound mode is shown. Generic temperature dependence

of QNM frequencies is very similar to the crossover case. The main diﬀerence compared to the

crossover potential (ﬁg. 3) is that at Tc the hydrodynamic description of the system breaks down

already at smaller momenta scales.

6 The ﬁrst order phase transition case

In this section we discuss the most fascinating case of a system which exhibits a 1st order phase

transition. There are two possible scenarios for such a transition: one is similar to Hawking-Page

case where there is a transition from a black hole to the vacuum geometry without a horizon [18].

The second one, mentioned in ref. [16], is a transition from one black hole solution to another.

In this section we consider the latter case while the former appears in the studies of IHQCD

models (cf. sec. 7). The onset of the appearance of a nonpropagating sound mode in the deeply

overcooled phase has been observed earlier in a related model [5].

In the V1st potential case there exist three characteristic temperatures. The ﬁrst one is the

minimal temperature Tm, below which no unstable solution exists. The onset of instability is
seen at temperatures T (cid:38) Tm (in the branch where c2
s(T ) < 0), and generically we expect the
1st order phase transition to appear at a critical temperature Tc ≥ Tm, which is determined
by the temperature dependence of the Free Energy. To evaluate this one can either use direct

on-shell actions or one can use the method outlined in section 2. The latter uses the standard
thermodynamic relation F = −s dT , where the integration constant can be ﬁxed by the choice
of the reference geometry with vanishing horizon area, which in this case corresponds to T = 0

solution. Temperature dependence of the FE for this case is shown in the right panel of
ﬁg. 7 and we determined Tc (cid:39) 1.05Tm. The other characteristic temperature is estimated
to be Tch (cid:39) 1.0001Tm, which is based on the observation, that for a range of momenta the

hydrodynamic modes become purely imaginary and do not propagate in the plasma (cf. ﬁg 8).
This eﬀect appears for temperatures Tm ≤ T ≤ Tch, in the stable region of the EoS (green line
in left panel of ﬁg. 7). Let us note that in this model Tm < Tch < Tc.

Now we take a look at QNM structure at the minimal temperature Tm, in which the green

line and red-dashed line meet in ﬁg. 7 and the speed of sound vanishes. There is no new structure

in the shear channel and we only plot the sound channel QNM’s in ﬁgure 9. One may see a new

pattern at this point compared to the crossover and the 2nd order phase transition cases, i.e.,
the hydrodynamic modes are purely imaginary (diﬀusive-like) for q ≤ 1.

The most engrossing physics is discovered in the spinodal region (red-dashed line ﬁg. 7)

where the equation of state suggests thermodynamical instability, i.e., c2

s < 0 (cf. ﬁg. 7). It
was already anticipated in literature [34, 35] that in this range of temperatures a corresponding

dynamical instability should appear in the lowest QNM mode.

We study the instability phenomenon in detail by observing the bubble formation in the

spinodal region. It is generically expected in the case of the 1st order phase transition [28]

and a similar eﬀect was observed in the gravity context by Gregory and Laﬂamme [36]. The

formation happens when c2
s < 0, which means that hydrodynamic mode is purely imaginary
ωH = ±i|cs|k − iΓsk2. For small enough k the mode with the plus sign is in the unstable
region, i.e., Im ωH > 0. For larger momenta the other term starts to dominate, so that there
is kmax = |cs|/Γs for which the hydrodynamic mode becomes again stable. The scale of the
bubble is the momentum for which positive imaginary part of the hydrodynamic mode attains

the maximal value. Imaginary part of the unstable hydrodynamic mode is called the growth

rate [28]. It is intriguing to note, that for the V1st potential the hydro mode is purely imaginary
up to momenta q ≈ 5, i.e., in all investigated range. An interesting observation is that all higher
modes remain stable in this case. Plot illustrating these words is presented in ﬁg. 10.

Not only in the case when there is an instability region in the EoS, but also for the temperature

close to the Tm in the stable region and at Tm the hydrodynamic modes become purely imaginary.

These cases are shown in ﬁgures 10, 8, 9 respectively. When a hydrodynamic mode, ωH (k), is

purely imaginary, one can express it as

ωH (k) = ±iO(k) − iE(k) ,

(35)

with O(−k) = −O(k) and E(−k) = E(k). Then there are two separated branches of the
hydrodynamical modes, as seen in ﬁgures 8, 9 and 10. When this happens hydrodynamical mode

is not a propagating one, but has some sort of a ”diﬀusive-like” behaviour.

7 The improved holographic QCD

This potential is in a class designed to grasp the dynamical features of QCD: the asymptotic

freedom and colour conﬁnement [16, 17]. In those aspects it is a more detailed model than the

one used in section 4. Asymptotic freedom is implemented by logarithmic corrections to the

masses on the consecutive number, i.e., m2

potential in the UV region, while conﬁnement is detected by a linear dependence of the glueballs
n ∼ n for large n. This is sometimes referred to as
a linear conﬁnement [37]. The potential we choose has conﬁning IR asymptotic, but does not

include the logarithmic corrections in the UV.

The IHQCD potential determines unique equation of state, with a rich structure displayed in

ﬁg. 11. The two branches of black hole solutions are divided as usual into large (stable), and

small (unstable) conﬁgurations. Stable conﬁgurations show behaviour with the usual features

characteristic for a system with a ﬁrst order phase transition, and the corresponding speed of

On the contrary, unstable branch

consists of two distinct subbranches. One of them is in a disconnected range of temperatures,

Tm < T < T1 = 1.014Tm and T2 = 5.67Tm < T , and displays spinodal instability signaled by

the imaginary speed of sound. This in turn implies bubble formation as described in sec. 6.

Second sub-branch, T1 < T < T2, shows anomalously large speed of sound, but does not show

any instability on the level of equations of state. However, as will be shown below, in this range

of temperatures there exists an unstable non-hydro mode in the QNM spectrum.

This system is expected to have a phase transition of a 1st order between a black hole geometry

with an event horizon, and the vacuum conﬁning geometry in the spirit of Hawking-Page phase

transition [18]. In principle, to estimate Tc we can ﬁnd the temperature dependence of the

FE along the lines mentioned in sec. 2. In this case non of the methods brings up a decent

result. The direct evaluation of the on-shell action is corrupted by a numerical instability, while
the standard thermodynamic relation, dF = −s dT , suﬀers a problem of correct choice of the
reference conﬁguration. A possible candidate for reference geometry is the one of vanishing

horizon area in the unstable black hole branch. However it has inﬁnite temperature and it is not

clear for us whether it can be used as a proxy for the thermal gas geometry. Also the unstable

branch black holes exhibit a variety of pathologies (which will be described later) with increasing

T . Due to the above mentioned diﬃculties we refrained from estimating the value of Tc in this
particular model. Nevertheless we expect that there exists a critical temperature Tc ≥ Tm where
the transition takes place [15, 16]. This transition changes the geometry substantially.

It is important to note that in this case there exists a minimal temperature Tm below which

a black hole solution does not exist. As in the case of V1st the onset of instability appears at
T (cid:38) Tm (for conﬁgurations with c2

s(T ) < 0).

The diﬀerent structure of the EoS is reﬂected in the behaviour of QNM frequencies, which
indicate the existence of second characteristic temperature Tch (cid:39) 1.102Tm. The novel eﬀect
observed in this system is that for temperatures near the minimal temperature the ultralocality

property of the ﬁrst non-hydrodynamic mode is violated. The mode turns out to be purely
imaginary for very low momenta and for temperatures of the range Tm ≤ T ≤ Tch, and it does
not have a structure described in eq. (35). There are two purely imaginary modes which have

the following form

ω±(k) = iχ(k) ± iξ(k) .

(36)

In ﬁgure 12 we show the temperature dependence of those modes at k = 0 in the range where

there are purely imaginary. As the system is heated further the real part develops, and the

mode becomes the least damped non-hydrodynamic mode of the high-T limit, with the usual

range it is spitted into two purely imaginary branches (red and blue squares).

structure (30). It directly comes from the presence of the background scalar ﬁeld, which breaks

the conformal invariance.

Figure 13: Sound channel quasinormal modes for the potential VIHQCD at T = Tm. The

non-trivial behaviour of the real part of the modes is shown. In particular in this example the

ultralocality of non-hydrodynamic modes is violated, i.e., the non-hydro1 mode attains considerable

momentum dependence.

In ﬁg. 13 we show QNM’s in the sound channel computed for VIHQCD at T = Tm. The

mode structure is diﬀerent than the one generically present in previous cases. First thing which

is apparent is that hydrodynamic modes are purely imaginary for a range of small momenta.

of freedom at arbitrary low momentum, which in turn implies that the crossing happens at
very low value of qc (cid:39) 0.14 (see the insert in ﬁg. 13). As a matter of fact, in this case near
the Tm one must always take into account the non-hydrodynamic degrees of freedom in the

description of the system dynamics. Another absolutely fascinating eﬀect observed exactly at Tm

is that the non-hydrodynamic modes, which are purely imaginary for low momenta, join with

the hydrodynamic modes at some ﬁnite momentum qJ , and follow them with increasing q. This

eﬀect is illustrated in ﬁg. 13, where the non-hydro1 mode which has two branches joins with the
two branches of the hydro modes respectively at qJ (cid:39) 0.14 and qJ (cid:39) 1.5. In the same time the
real part develops with both signs, as expected from general considerations (see eq. (30)). This

eﬀect implies the ultralocality violation observed generically in other models, and joining does

not happen for temperatures higher than the minimal one. The ﬁnal observation from ﬁg. 13

is that the second non-hydrodynamic mode, referred to as non-hydro2, obeys the ultralocality

property, and for high temperatures it becomes the mode detected in the conformal case [3].

Interestingly enough a gaped purely imaginary mode was found in [39]. System considered

there was a holographic dual of superﬂuidity, and the mode obeying the dispersion relation
ω = −iγ(T ) − iDk2 was found in the superﬂuid phase. At the critical temperature γ(Tc) = 0
and the mode becomes an ordinary diﬀusive mode. Despite the similarity we have no good

physical explanation for this behaviour.

small black hole branch, which shows anomalously large speed of sound. In fact, c2

In this range of

temperatures the system does not exhibit any instability in thermodynamic quantities. However,

there appears to be a novel dynamical instability, signaled by the positive imaginary part of

the ﬁrst non-hydrodynamical mode 4. The diﬀerence with respect to the usual spinoidal region

is that for k = 0 the mode stays positive on the imaginary axis. Behaviour similar to the one

found at T = Tm is also found here: ﬁrst non-hydro mode stays purely imaginary for a range of

momenta, and merges with his partner when the real part is developed. The important diﬀerence

in this case is that merging is between two modes of the same physical nature.

8 Discussion

In the present paper we performed an extensive study of the linearized dynamics of excitations

in strongly coupled ﬁeld theories in the vicinity of a nontrivial phase structure of various kinds.

Generically the eﬀects are visible in the sound channel of the models, while the shear channel

remains less aﬀected.

We observed a number of novel features which were not present in the conformal case. For

relatively small momenta, the propagating hydrodynamical sound modes become more damped

than the lowest nonhydrodynamic degrees of freedom. This provides a more stringent restriction

on the applicability of hydrodynamics and indicates the necessity of incorporating these other

degrees of freedom on appropriate length scales. This is in contrast to the conformal case where a

similar phenomenon only occurred in the shear channel and only at a higher value of momentum.

The richness of phenomena appearing in the linearized regime strongly suggests that it would be

important to study the corresponding real-time dynamics also at the nonlinear level.

A speciﬁc prediction could be anticipated in the potential ﬁtted to lQCD equations of state.

Qualitative agreement of transport coeﬃcients computed in QCD, and predicted by this model

was known before [31] and it is conﬁrmed in our calculations. Our novel predictions, however,

are concerned with non-hydrodynamic degrees of freedom and breakdown of the hydrodynamic

description near the QCD critical region. One speciﬁc feature is the ultralocality property obeyed

by nonhydrodynamic modes. Keeping in mind the qualitative nature of those considerations, it

would be a very interesting task to compute similar spectrum in lattice QCD.

We study two systems which exhibit diﬀerent types of the 1st order phase transition as

determined by potentials V1st and VIHQCD. We explicitly determined the instability in the

spinoidal branch of both of them, and for V1st we estimated the length scale for bubble formation.

On top of that, both models posses generic minimal temperature, Tm, below which certain

solution cease to exist. From the temperature dependence of the QNM spectrum, in the stable

region of the corresponding EoS, one can see the existence of another characteristic temperature,

related to the appearance of the diﬀusive-like modes, which is slightly higher than Tm.

Number of novel phenomena is found in the case of IHQCD potential. At T = Tm the

hydrodynamic and the ﬁrst non-hydrodynamic modes become purely imaginary for low momenta.

This implies the violation of ultralocality property generically observed in other cases [13, 6].

One more surprising observation is that instead of the crossing of the modes, found generically

in the studied models, there is a “joining” phenomenon. From some value of the momentum

both the hydrodynamic and ﬁrst-non hydrodynamic mode obey the same dispersion relation. In

the same time, higher non-hydrodynamic modes admit ultralocal momentum dependence.

What makes the VIHQCD potential exceptional among the studied cases is a rich structure of

the small black hole branch solutions. The spectrum of quasinormal modes shows two type of

instabilities. One is the usual spinodal instability, similar to one found in the V1st case. This

appears exactly when the systems shows thermodynamic instability in equations of state. Second

is an instability triggered by the non-hydrodynamic mode. In this case the relation between EoS

and instabilities is that for conﬁgurations which have c2

s > 1/3 the ﬁrst non-hydrodynamic mode
becomes unstable. Two regions are separated and do not overlap. Up to our knowledge this is

the ﬁrst example where such a dynamical mechanism has been presented.

A On-shell action and Free Energy

In this appendix we give some details about asymptotic behaviour of our black hole solutions

and we show how, in principle, one can use this expansion to compute the Free Energy. Solving

the equations of motion (9)-(12), close to the boundary one can ﬁnd the asymptotic form of the

(41)
The coeﬃcients a0,m (with m > 1), b0,m (with m ≥ 1) can be found explicitly in terms of the
conformal weight ∆ and the coeﬃcient a0,1. By solving the equations of motion order by order,

5 s T .

c = 2 κ2

all higher coeﬃcients ak,m, bk,m (with k > 0) will be ﬁxed in terms of a0,1, ∆ and c. For a given

solution which is unique for a given rH = φH one can read oﬀ numerically a0,1 coeﬃcient by

studying the near boundary behaviour.

Let us notice that our black hole Ansatz (5) reduces to a thermal gas solution by imposing the

c = 0 condition [17]. In other words, all coeﬃcients in the blackening function h are proportional

to positive powers of c.

To compute the Free Energy of a given solution using the holographic renormalization

approach one needs to know the boundary counter terms. Introducing the thermal gas solution

with a ”good” singularity [23] as the reference conﬁguration one can calculate the Free Energy

βF = lim
→0

(SBH() − STG()) ,

(42)

without having the explicit form of the counter terms, since their contribution in two solutions

(black hole and thermal gas) will be canceled. We follow the method which has been explained

in detail in appendix C of [17]. The main diﬀerence we want to emphasize is that thanks to the

gauge we choose for our radial coordinate, φ = r, we can use the same cut-oﬀ on both solutions.

Computing the On-shell action (including Gibbons-Hawking term) for a given black hole solution

and subtracting the corresponding On-shell action of the thermal gas solution one shows that,

(cid:110)
e4A()−B()(cid:0)6h()A(cid:48)() + h(cid:48)()(cid:1) − 6e4A()− ˜B()(cid:112)h() ˜A(cid:48)()

where V3 is the volume of 3-space and functions with tilde correspond to the thermal gas solution

with the same asymptotic as the black hole. Plugging the near boundary expansion (37)-(39) in

(43) it is easy to see that the divergent terms will be canceled, namely

(a01 − ˜a01) ,

(44)

where a01 and ˜a01 are the coeﬃcients of the near boundary expansion of the black hole and

thermal gas solution respectively. The ﬁrst term is what we expect for a conformal theory in

(3+1)-dimension and the second term corresponds to gluon condensation [17].

We would like to note that the subtraction term proportional to ˜a01 is constant. One may

use this fact to ﬁnd its value numerically by taking the zero-size limit of the black hole solutions,

which corresponds to the ”good” singularity deﬁnition [23].

For our V1st potential we ﬁnd the a01 parameter for a given solution by ﬁtting our numerical
solution for function A(r) with the asymptotic expansion (37) up to O(r40). The results are stable
and in perfect agreement with the other method explained in section 2.2. The corresponding Free

Energy is given in the right panel of Fig. (7). Unfortunately, we can use neither this numerical

method (because of numerical instability), nor the method using the thermodynamic relation

(19) (due to the diﬃculties sketched in section 7) to compute the Free Energy for the potential

VIHQCD.

B QNMs equations of motion and numerical details

In this appendix we show explicitly the QNM equations of motion, obtained by linearization of

the Einstein-Scalar system of equations for the gauge invariant combinations of the ﬂuctuations.

Using the deﬁnition of Z1(r) and Z2(r) we can then decouple equations of motion for sound

channel and nonconfomral channel and set them as

M2(r)Z(cid:48)(cid:48)
N2(r)Z(cid:48)(cid:48)

1 (r) + M1(r)Z(cid:48)
2 (r) + N1(r)Z(cid:48)

1(r) + M0(r)Z1(r) + K0(r)Z2(r) = 0 ,
2(r) + N0(r)Z2(r) + L1(r)Z(cid:48)

1(r) + L0(r)Z1(r) = 0 .

(45)

In the k = 0 case all equations, except for the Z2(r) which remains coupled to Z1(r), reduce to

scalar ﬁeld equations. This case has been studied in ref. [6].

In the case of shear channel, Z3(r), the gauge invariant form is given in (25) and the QNM

At k = 0 this equations reduces to a equation of motion of minimally coupled massless scalar

ﬁeld which was studied in [6].

In order to solve equations (45) and (46), which are linear ordinary diﬀerential equations, we

use spectral discretization with Chebyshev polynomials [21]. The resulting matrix equation is

of polynomial character in the mode frequency ω and we determine QNMs by evaluating the

determinant of the matrix and setting it to zero. Corresponding vectors in the kernel of this

matrix are discretized versions of the radial dependence of the desired solutions. To ﬁnd physical

solutions with the right boundary behaviour we ﬁt the tail of the function to a form obtained

from small r (near the conformal boundary) analysis. In particular for the modes Z1(r) and

Z2(r) this procedure is non-trivial and the asymptotic expansions are given in eq. (29).
