Abstract.
In this paper, we review some general formulations of exact renormalisation
group equations and loop equations for tensors models and tensorial group ﬁeld theories.
We illustrate the use of these equations in the derivation of the leading order expectation
values of observables in tensor models. Furthermore, we use the exact renormalisation group
equations to establish a suitable scaling dimension for interactions in Abelian tensorial group
ﬁeld theories with a closure constraint. We also present analogues of the loop equations for
tensor models.

Introduction

Tensor models are higher dimensional generalisations of matrix models that have been introduced
more than twenty ﬁve years ago [1]. The aim was to reproduce in dimension D > 2 the successes
of matrix models in providing a theory of random geometries. This is of high interest in multiple
ﬁelds of physics, especially in discrete approaches to quantising gravity. The basic idea is that
a suitable integral over a rank D tensor T is the partition function of a theory of random
triangulations in dimension D,

(cid:90)

dµC(T ) exp−V (T ) =

rank D
tensors

(cid:88)

A(G).

(1)

In this Feynman graph expansion, dµC is a Gaußian measure on tensors, V an interaction
potential and A the resulting weight associated to the graph G. By a certain duality procedure,
these graphs are in one to one correspondence with triangulations of dimension D. Thus random
tensors provide a natural way to construct models of random geometries in dimension D.

However, the combinatorics of tensor model turned out to be much more intricate than the
matrix model one. Therefore, progress in this ﬁeld remained very slow until a couple of years
ago, when a new impetus arose thanks to the introduction of coloured tensor models by Gurau
[2]. This allowed him to a derive for the ﬁrst time a 1/N expansion [3], where N is the size of
the tensor and prove Gaußian universality at large N [4]. This breakthrough was followed by
many other works in the ﬁeld, reﬁning the 1/N expansion or adding new degrees of freedom that
can be interpreted as matter leaving on the triangulations. Finally, a double scaling limit has
been obtained: when some parameters in V are taken to their critical a critical value together
with N → ∞, the series over triangulations reproduces a continuum limit, see [5] and [6]. We
refer to [7] for a recent overview of random tensors.
A second important breakthrough occurred when Ben Geloun and Rivasseau constructed
the ﬁrst renormalisable group ﬁeld theory [8]. Group ﬁeld theories [9] are speciﬁc quantum
ﬁeld theories deﬁned, in dimension D, over D copies of a group often taken to be SU(2) or
several copies of U(1). As far as the combinatorics is concerned, the group ﬁeld Φ(g1, . . . , gD)
is analogous to the tensor Ti1,...,iD . Thus, a functional integral over Φ generates a sum over
triangulations weighted by some group integrals. When the potential is suitably chosen, these
weights reproduce the spin foam amplitudes in loop quantum gravity. We refer the reader to the
monographs by Rovelli [10] and Thiemann [11] for an account of loop quantum gravity. Then,
group ﬁeld theory provides a prescription on how to sum these amplitudes. This is crucial in
order to investigate some properties of the theory, like triangulation independence or summation
over topologies. Moreover, if available, a double scaling limit could be interpreted a continuum
limit, including a sum over topologies. This interplay between the various amplitudes also plays
a key role in the renormalisation of group ﬁeld theories: the renormalised theory is constructed
recursively using the combinatorics of subgraphs, thus the amplitude of smaller triangulations.
Let us note that the model renormalised in [8] is based on a abelian group of the type U(1)d.
This has been followed by the renormalisation of other abelian models. A further decisive step
was made by Carrozza, Oriti and Rivasseau in [12], when a rank three model based on SU(2)
with closure constraint has been renormalised. Such a model would open the possibility, if

deﬁned non perturbatively, to construct a quantum theory of gravity in D = 3 that includes
topology change. Finally, let us mention that the study of D = 4 models with a Barrett-Crane
or Engle-Peirera-Rovelli-Livine/Freidel-Krasnov vertex is currently under scrutiny by various
researchers. These models include the simplicity constraint as well as the closure constraint, the
former being essential in making contacts with general relativity in D = 4.

In this paper, we aim at revisiting these two breakthroughs in light of the exact renormal-
isation group equation, in Polchinski’s formulation [13]. The latter is a functional diﬀerential
equation that allows to implement Wilson’s ideas in a general setting in quantum ﬁeld theory.
It translates into a ﬂow equation for all the couplings of the theory, hence the name ”exact”,
that prescribes how the couplings should be modiﬁed in order to take into account the eﬀects
of the high energy modes that have been integrated. As consequence, the evolution equation
allows to classify the various couplings according to their degree of relevancy. This is what is
done here: In the tensor model case, we identify the dominant couplings in the large N limit
while for group ﬁeld theories we identify the relevant couplings that govern the high spin limit.
Moreover, it allows to trade the functional integral formalism for a functional diﬀerential
equation, from which many physical consequences can be drawn without having to resort to
Feynman graphs evaluation. This is precisely the point of view adopted here: While the funda-
mental results presented above have been obtained by expanding (1) in Feynman graphs, these
results can also be derived within the exact renormalisation group equation. The latter is an
equation for the eﬀective vertices that collects a sum over Feynman graphs. From a geomet-
rical perspective, the eﬀective vertices correspond to boundary triangulations and collects all
triangulations corresponding to a ﬁxed boundary.

However, our approach remains perturbative in nature since no attempt has been made to
deﬁne the quantities we manipulate as analytic functions of the parameters of the potential.
Recently, various non perturbative results have been obtained [14] by summing up the pertur-
bative series. Such an approach is called ”constructive ﬁeld theory” and we refer the reader to
book [15] and the recent review [16] for a detailed account of the ﬁeld theory case. Alterna-
tively, the exact renormalisation group equation in Wetterich’s formulation can be solved using
a truncation as will be brieﬂy reviewed in section 3.8. Wetterich’s equation is equivalent at the
perturbative level to Polchinski’s one but more suitable for truncations. This is not to say that
the quantities we manipulate are devoid of interest. Besides being useful bookkeeping devices
that collect many graphs, they are also of primary physical interest in a quantum theory of
gravity. Indeed, in a path integral formulation of quantum gravity, one would be interested in
integrating over all space-time geometries with ﬁxed value on the boundary. This would deﬁne
the ”wave function” of the gravitational ﬁeld.

As a functional diﬀerential equation to be satisﬁed by the eﬀective theory, exact renormali-
sation group equations bear some common features with the Schwinger-Dyson equations. More
in general, the invariance of the integral (1) under change of variables translate into a set of
constraints on the latter that can be expressed as diﬀerential operators with respect to the pa-
rameters appearing in the potential. In the matrix model case, these equations are known as
the ”loop equations” and play a prominent role , especially in deriving the double scaling limit
and in establishing some connection to integrable hierarchies. For tensor models, analogues of
these equations have been derived in [17] and applied to the large N limit in [18]. The potential
of these equations for tensor models has not yet been completely explored and it is possible that
they lead to signiﬁcant results, as in the matrix model case.

Our paper is organised as follows. In the ﬁrst section, we present the general framework of
tensor models and tensorial group ﬁeld theories. The second section is devoted to the exact
renormalisation group equation. First, we introduce Wilson’s ideas and formulate Polchinski’s
equation in the context of quantum ﬁeld theory. Then, we apply this formalism to tensor models.
As a ﬁrst application, we derive the scaling properties of the eﬀective couplings which lead to an

4

alternative proof of Gurau’s universality [4]. These equations are also formulated for group ﬁeld
theories in a general setting. Then, we apply them to propose a scaling dimension for all the
couplings in the case of abelian group ﬁeld theories with closure constraints. As a by product, we
recover the list of ﬁve renormalisable theories ﬁrst identiﬁed in [12]. We close this section by a
formulation of the ﬂow equation for spin networks and a brief discussion of the non perturbative
results based on Wetterich’s equation. The third and last section deals with loop equations. We
start by expressing reparametrisation invariance in quantum ﬁeld theory and then formulate the
analogue of the loop equations for tensor models and stress the analogies between tensors and
matrices. Finally, we illustrate the use of the loop equations in deriving the values of the leading
order expectation values, following [18].

2 Tensor models

Matrix models turn out to be ubiquitous in mathematics and physics. For instance, they appear
in combinatorics of maps and statistical physics on random triangulated surfaces. Tensor models
aim at providing a higher dimensional generalisation of matrix models, with a particular view
towards generation of random triangulations of spaces of dimension D > 2. Thus, the basic
variables we consider are rank D complex tensors Ti1,...,iD and its complex conjugate T i1,...,iD ,
with indices ik ∈ {1, . . . , N}, the integer N being the size of the tensor. Let us stress that
the models considered here involves a tensor and its complex conjugate, treated as independent
variables. Furthermore, these tensors are not required to fulﬁl any symmetry relations upon
permutations of their indices. For instance, in the D = 2 case, they correspond to non hermitian
matrices.

There is a natural transformation of a rank D complex tensor under the direct product of D

copies of the group U(N )

with (U 1, . . . , U D) ∈ U(N ) × ··· × U(N ). This large transformation group is available because
we do not impose any symmetry under permutations of indices, otherwise two indices that can
be permuted must transform in the same way under the unitary group, so that the symmetry
is reduced from U(N ) × U(N ) down to U(N ). Finally, let us also note that it is possible to
let the various indices vary in diﬀerent ranges, ik ∈ {1, . . . , Nk}. Then, unitary transformations
correspond to the group U(N1) × ··· × U(Nk). Although useful from a combinatorial point of
view, we do not consider this generalisation here and stick to the case N1 = ··· Nk = N .

2.1 Invariant potentials for random tensors

In analogy with random matrices, we construct a theory of random tensors, we have to deﬁne a
certain probability measure on the space of tensors. The latter is of the form

dµC(T, T ) exp−V (T, T )

Z

(3)

where dµC(C, T ) is a Gaußian measure of covariance C, V (T, T ) the interaction potential and
Z the partition function deﬁned as

(cid:90)

Z =

dµC(T, T ) exp−V (T, T ).

(4)

ERGE and loop equations for tensor models

5

Then, the expectation value of an observable, taken to be any function O(T, T ) of the components
of the tensors, is deﬁned as

(cid:82) dµC(T, T )O(T, T ) exp−V (T, T )

Z

(cid:104)O(cid:105) =

.

(5)

Unless otherwise stated, we restrict our attention to invariant random tensors. This means that
dµC(T, T ), O(T, T ) and V (T, T ) have to be invariant under the action of U(N ) × ··· × U(N ),
see (2).
Polynomial invariants of the components of the tensors are constructed using particular
graphs which are called D-bubbles. A D-bubble is a bipartite D-coloured graph. This means
that:

• There are two types of vertices, black ones • and white ones ◦.
• An edge can connect only a black vertex to a white vertex.
• At any vertex there are exactly D incident edges.
• Each edge is decorated by a colour in {1, . . . , D} in such a way that the colours of the D

edges incident to any vertex are all diﬀerent.

The invariant associated to a D-bubble is deﬁned by assigning a tensor T to a white vertex, a
tensor T to a black vertex, identify the indices ik in T and ik in T whenever they are connected
by a line of colour k and summing over all tensor indices. In analogy with the trace invariants
of matrix models, such an invariant is written as

TrB(T, T ) =(cid:88)

(6)

where e is an edge between a white vertex v(e) and a black vertex v(e) and c(e) its colour. For
example, the invariants associated to two 3-bubbles are given in ﬁgure 1.

Let us note that we do not restrict ourselves to connected bubbles, though the invariant of
a disconnected bubble factorizes over its connected components. In the particular case D = 2,
connected bubble invariants are deﬁned by a single even integer, the number n of edges, and
are just traces of power of the matrix M M†, TrB(M, M ) = Tr(M M†)n/2.
In this case, non
connected bubbles correspond to product of traces, also known as multitrace operators.

A polynomial invariant potential for a rank D tensor is deﬁned by summing over a ﬁnite set

of D-bubbles, each weighted by a complex number λB, called its coupling constant,

V (T, T ) =

λB

TrB(T , T ).

CB is a combinatorial factor introduced for later convenience, it is the cardinal of the group of
transformation of edges and vertices that preserve the bubble.
There is a single quadratic trace invariant up to a factor. It is associated to the dipole, a

bubble made of two vertices connected by D edges, see ﬁgure 1. Its trace invariant reads

, which means that

By the same token, invariant observables are also labelled by D-bubbles,

for positive t.

Alternatively, any bubble observable can be expanded in powers of the components of the tensors.
Thus, the basic object to compute is the expectation value of a product of components

(cid:11).

In analogy with quantum ﬁeld theory, these expectation values are referred to as correlation
functions. Because of U(1) invariance, correlation functions vanish if there is not an equal
number of T and T .

Thus, we reduce the computation of the expectation value of an observable to that of an in-
variant bubble. Moreover, bubble interactions may be used to generate expectations of bubble
observables,

2.2 Perturbative expansion

Let us now give the basic features of the expansion of an arbitrary bubble observable as a formal
power series in the bubble couplings λB. Using (13), we reduce such a computation to that of
the partition function, considered as a function of the bubble couplings,

(17)

To proceed, we expand the exponential and integrate over the tensors using Wick’s theorem
with the covariance (10). The latter can be formulated as the computation of the Gaußian
expectation value of the product of n pairs of a tensor and its complex conjugate

(18)

The sum over all permutations is nothing but the familiar sum over all pairings, with the
constraint that a tensor is paired with its complex conjugate. The Gaußian expectation value
of a product of n tensors T with n tensors T vanishes when n (cid:54)= n.
Applying Wick’s theorem to any monomial obtained by expanding the potential amounts to
summing over all contractions of T with T . Any such contraction corresponds to the contraction
of a pair of vertices of diﬀerent colours in a bubble, deﬁned as follows. Consider a bubble B,
which may be disconnected, as is the case if it arises from two diﬀerent bubble couplings or from
a single bubble coupling associated with a disconnected bubble. Choose a white vertex v and
black vertex v in B and remove them, leaving a set of coloured half edges. Then, reattach the
half edges respecting the colours. The resulting bubble is denoted by B/vv. It is convenient to
materialise the choice of the pair of vertices in B before contraction by an extra colour 0 edge,
represented by a dashed line, see ﬁgure 2. Note that if the pairs of vertices are already connected
by k edges in B, then the pair contraction yields k circles, so that we have an extra factor of N k
resulting from the summation over the k indices.

Accordingly, the perturbative expansion of the partition function can be represented as a

This expression is obtained by contracting all pairs of vertices, thus yielding (D+1)-bubbles one
we represent the pair contractions by a colour 0 line. The pair contractions can be used, in any
order, to successively reduce the bubbles to a disjoint union of circles, each of them yielding a
factor of N . On the bubble G, it can be viewed as the total number of faces with colour 0. Recall
that a face of colours 0 and k is a connected subgraph of G obtained by removing all colours
except 0 and k. E(G) is the number of colour 0 edges of G. The bubbles B ⊂ G are simply
the D-bubbles we started with. On the example of ﬁgure 3, the 3-bubble in the potentials have
been drawn on a shaded disc, there is one disconnected 3-bubble (two dipoles) considered as a
single interaction in the potential, whose contribution to the potential is

(cid:0)T · T(cid:1)2.

The 4-bubble of ﬁgure 3 is 0-connected but not connected.

In many cases, it is useful to consider the logarithm of Z. The latter is expanded over

where a bubble is said to be 0-connected is the graph (with only colour 0 lines) obtained by

connected if some of the bubbles B ⊂ G are disconnected.
This expansion can be given a geometrical interpretation that may be used in discretised ap-
proaches to quantum gravity and random geometry. Each bubble G with D + 1 colors represents
a coloured triangulation of a space of dimension D. Its simplices of dimension D are the vertices

Figure 4. Triangulation of a 3d sphere with 2 tetrahedra

of G attached along their D − 1 faces following the edges of G. Thus, the expansion of the
logarithm of the partition function (21) provides a sum over coloured triangulations. If all the
bubbles in the potential are connected, then log Z provides us with a sum over connected trian-
gulations. For instance, the dipole graph represents a triangulation of a sphere by 2 simplices,
see ﬁgure 4.

Triangulations with boundary are represented by correlation functions, see (14). (D + 1)-
bubbles contributing to a correlation with n tensors T and T have 2n colour 0 external legs.
Such a bubble B gives rise to the boundary bubble ∂B. Vertices of ∂B are external legs of B.
They are connected by an edge of colour k if and only if the two external legs belong to a face
of colour 0k in B. Recall that in a coloured tensor models a face of colours i1 . . . ik in a bubble
is a connected component of the subgraph made of edges of colours i1 . . . ik in B.
2.3 Tensorial group ﬁeld theories

Tensorial group ﬁeld theories are particular quantum ﬁeld theories deﬁned on D copies of a
group, usually SU(2), U(1)d, Rd or SL(2, C). They are constructed in analogy with tensor
models, we replace tensors by functions of D copies of the group,

Ti1,...,iD → Φ(g1, . . . , gD)

T i1,...,iD → Φ(g1, . . . , gD).

(22)

Note that g is not the complex conjugate of g but an independent group element that is an
argument of the complex conjugate ﬁeld Φ. In quantum gravity applications, D denotes the
space-time dimension and the group is the Lorentz group, the euclidian group or their univer-
sal covers. The group ﬁeld Φ(g1, . . . , gD) represents a D − 1 simplex and the group variables
g1, . . . , gD are associated with its D (D−1)-faces, see ﬁgure 6.
In many models, the group elements are related to the normals of the tetrahedron. Then,
it is assumed that they obey a closure constraint. The colusre cndition is implemented as an

Λ and Λ0 are cut-oﬀs that have to be introduced to avoid divergences. Group integrations are
performed using the Haar measure and implement the required invariances.

As for the tensor models, the general interaction potential can also be expanded over D-
bubbles. However, in this case there is no reason to impose unitary invariance. Therefore, we
use the general form of the bubble couplings (15), replacing tensor indices by group elements,

Then, the perturbative expansion yields a sum over triangulations of dimension D, weighted

2.4 Couplings in the spin network basis

The relation to spin foam models can be more precise if we formulate the theory in terms of
spins j (labelling representations of SU(2)) and intertwiners ι (invariant tensors) in the case of
SU(2). Then, we expand the bubble couplings using the Peter-Weyl theorem,

that the couplings can be simply indexed by a spin network. For example, for the dipole graph,

This can be considered as a non Abelian Fourier transform,

(30)

Moreover, it is important to realise that the existence of the intertwiner between representations
labelled by spins puts some constraints on these spins. For instance, for three spins j1, j2,
j3, there exists an intertwiner (and it is then unique up to normalisation) if and only if the
triangular inequality |j1 − j2| ≤ j3 ≤ j1 + j2 is satisﬁed.

3 Exact renormalisation group equations

3.1 Wilson’s ideas in quantum ﬁeld theory

Let us start with a heuristic overview of Wilson’s idea in quantum ﬁeld theory, deferring a more
precise formulation till the next section. Consider a quantum ﬁeld theory with an action S0

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

T. Krajewski and R. Toriumi

and a UV cut-oﬀ Λ0. The basic object of interest is the generating functional of correlation
functions,

Z[J] =

[Dφ]Λ0 exp{−S0[φ] + Jφ} .

(31)

where [Dφ]Λ0 is a measure that integrates only over ﬁelds with momenta (cid:46) Λ0.

Wilson’s idea amounts to perform this integration not in a single step but in a series of partial
integrations. The cutoﬀ Λ0 is then reduced to a lower cutoﬀ Λ by integrating the modes between
Λ and Λ0. The low energy physics, for instance correlation functions for ﬁelds at momenta (cid:46) Λ
is then left unchanged. Denoting by φ0 the original ﬁeld with modes less than Λ0, φ a ﬁeld with
modes less than Λ and by χ the remaining degrees of freedom between Λ and Λ0,

φ0 = φ + χ.

(32)

This separations of modes translates into the following equation for the generating functional

Z[J] =

=

=

[Dφ0]Λ0 exp{−S0[φ0] + Jφ0} ,
[Dφ]Λ[Dχ]Λ,Λ0 exp{−S0[φ + χ] + Jφ + Jχ}
[Dφ]Λ exp{−SΛ[φ] + Jφ}

(33)

(34)

(35)

where we have used Jχ = 0 since we are only interested in the low energy correlation functions.
SΛ is the Wilsonian eﬀective action at scale Λ deﬁned by

(cid:90)

(cid:88)

(cid:90)

SΛ[φ] = − log

[Dχ]Λ,Λ0 exp−S0[φ + χ].

This procedure leads to a ﬂow equation for the eﬀective action

Λ

dSΛ
dΛ

= β(Λ, SΛ),

with the initial condition SΛ0 = S0.

(36)

(37)

The physics of this equation is best captured by expanding the eﬀective action in local
operators, which are monomials of the ﬁelds and their derivatives. Writing symbolically O[∂d, φn]
such a monomial with n occurrences of the ﬁeld and d derivatives, the action reads, in a space-
time of dimension D,

SΛ[φ] =

dDx gi(Λ) O[∂di, φni].

(38)

The ﬂow equation for the eﬀective action (37) translates into a system of equations for the
couplings,

Λ

dgi
dΛ

= βi(Λ,{gj}).

(39)

It is convenient to write this equation in terms of dimensionless couplings ui(Λ), related to gi(Λ)
by

gi(Λ) = Λδiui(Λ)

(40)

ERGE and loop equations for tensor models

13

where δi is the canonical dimension of the local operator i. Assuming translational invariance,
this dimension is

(cid:18) D

(cid:19)

δi = D − ni

2 − 1

− di.

(41)

(42)

Dimensional analysis allows us to write the ﬂow equation for dimensionless couplings as

Λ

dui
dΛ

= −δiui + βi({uj}).

Couplings are classiﬁed according to the sign of their dimension:

• Relevant couplings with δi > 0,
• Irrelevant couplings with δi < 0,
• Marginal couplings with δi = 0.

In the vicinity of the Gaussian ﬁxed point u∗i = 0 (i.e.
consequences of this equation are the following:

in perturbation theory), the physical

• Universality: Whatever the irrelevant couplings at scale Λ0 are (provided ui(Λ0) are
bounded, so that gi(Λ0) ∼ Λδi
0 go to zero for large Λ0), when Λ0 → ∞, the couplings
at scale Λ are attracted towards a manifold that can be parametrized by the relevant and
marginal couplings only.

• Renormalisability: When Λ0 → ∞ with Λ ﬁxed, the relevant and marginal couplings at
scale Λ diverge. Perturbative renormalisation amounts to impose their values at Λ by a
measurement. Then, all the other operators can be computed at scale Λ in terms of the
relevant and marginal operators at scale Λ, in the limit Λ0 → ∞.

This provides a rationale for renormalisation: When renormalisable couplings (i.e. couplings
with δi ≥ 0) are available, the latter dominate the low energy behaviour in the limit Λ0 → ∞,
low energy physics can be formulated in terms of low energy parameters. Of course, when no
such couplings exist, for instance if they are forbidden by symmetries, the limit Λ0 → cannot
be taken.
These statements can be rigorously proved in perturbation theory, see [13]. Obviously, a
non perturbative study is required, especially when marginal couplings are involved or when no
renormalisable couplings are available. It may also be that the theory is attracted towards a
non trivial ﬁxed point. Finally, let us also mention that these ideas also play a prominent role
in constructive physics, The latter aims at a non perturbative construction of the theory based
on a multiscale analysis of the Feynman graphs.

3.2 Exact renormalisation group equations

In order to understand how the previous ideas can be implemented in tensor models and tensorial
group ﬁeld theories, a more precise formulation is required. Within this section, we remain in
the general setting of a quantum ﬁeld theory.
In order to keep the notations as simple and
universal as possible, we write ﬁelds as φi, where i may be a discrete index, a space-time index
or a momentum. We separate the action into a quadratic part and an interaction potential
V0[φ]. The quadratic part is included into a Gaußian measure of covariance C(t, t0) which we
assume to be written as an integral

C(t, t0) =

ds K(s).

The interacting part of eﬀective action is deﬁned as

V (t, φ) = − log

(44)

with the initial condition V (t0, φ) = V0[φ] since C(t0, t0) = 0 so that there is no integration.

The eﬀective interaction V (t, φ) obey the semi-group relation, see [19],

At the perturbative level, the eﬀective potential (44) can be expanded over Feynman graphs using
the background ﬁeld technique. φ dependent vertices are introduced by expanding V0(φ + χ)
in powers of χ. Then, Feynman graphs are generated by integrating over χ. Then, the ﬂow
equation provides a recursive construction of these graphs by successively adding edges. The
ﬁrst term corresponds to a tree edge (between two connected components) and the second one
to a loop edge (within the same connected component), see ﬁgure (7).

While Polchinski’s equation is a powerful tool in the perturbative case, in non perturbative
investigations (for instance search for non trivial ﬁxed points using truncations), it is often more
convenient to sum the contributions of the trees. This is achieved by introducing the Legendre
transform Γ of V with respect to some sources. Alternatively Γ can be deﬁned in analogy with
(44) by

Γ(t, φ) = − log

Wetterich’s equation is particularly useful in the search for ﬁxed points. A ﬁxed point is an
eﬀective action such β(S∗) = 0. Because Λ dS
dΛ = β(S), a ﬁxed point action describes a scale
invariant theory. These ﬁx point play an important role in physics. In statistical physics, the
long distance behaviour at a second order phase transition is governed by a infrared stable ﬁxed
point (i.e. with only few divergent directions), known as the Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed point. In this
case the ultraviolet cut-oﬀ Λ0 is ﬁxed because it is nothing but the inverse lattice spacing. The
vicinity of the critical point is described by this ﬁxed point in the long distance limit Λ (cid:28) Λ0.
On the other side, ultraviolet stable ﬁxed point may allow the large cut-oﬀ limit Λ0 → ∞ in
theories of fundamental interactions. Asymptotically free theories provide natural examples with
a Gaußian ﬁxed point but more general ﬁxed point have been found in some simple models, like
the D = 3 Gross-Neveu model. Then, physical theories are parametrised by the few coordinates
on the stable manifold. Such a scenario, known as ”asymptotic safety”, has been proposed by
Weinberg and may allow to construct a quantum theory of gravity with only ﬁeld theoretical
degrees of freedom. We refer the reader to the reviews [20], [21] and [22] for more complete
overviews of these renormalisation group equations.

The ﬁeld theory case presented in the previous section is recovered by taking t = log(Λ/Λref),
where Λref is an immaterial reference scale that disappears from the equations. Then, Ct0,t =
CΛ0,Λ smoothly integrates out modes between Λ and Λ0. In momentum space, it can be written
as

C(Λ0, Λ, p, q) = δ(p + q)

dΛ(cid:48)
Λ(cid:48)

K(Λ(cid:48), p).

(52)

Sources can be included in V for convenience since we assume that they decouple from the
high energy behaviour. When formulated in momentum space, the ﬂow equation (48) for a
translationally invariant ﬁeld theory takes the form

(55)

Then, dimensional analysis can be done by further expanding Gn in powers of the momenta.

The next sections are devoted to an implementation of these ideas in the context of tensor

models and tensorial group ﬁeld theories, following our presentation in [23].

3.3 Polchinski’s equation for invariant tensor models

Let us ﬁrst consider an analogue of the Polchinski’s exact renormalisation group equation (48)
for random tensors. We consider a covariance C(t, t0) such that (43). The eﬀective potential is
deﬁned as in (44),

V (t, T, T ) = − log

dµC(t,t0)(T (cid:48), T (cid:48)) exp−V0(t, T + T (cid:48), T + T (cid:48)).

In order to preserve unitary invariance (2), the covariance has to be diagonal, see (10). In this
section, we restrict our attention to

Ci1,...,iD|i1,...,iD

(t, t0) = K (t − t0)

δik,ik

,

(58)

with K independent of t and t0. Although simple, such a covariance is not really in accordance
with the spirit of Wilson’s ideas.
It would be better to choose a covariance that gradually
reduces the size of the tensors by integrating over some of its components. For simplicity, we
restrict ourselves to an invariant integration. We refer to [24] and to [25] for an application of
a reduction of the size to matrix models suing Wetterich’s equation.

In the unitary invariant case, we expand the interaction potential over bubbles as in (7)

V (t, T, T ) =

λB(t)
CB

TrB(T , T ),

(59)

with couplings that depend on the parameter t controlling the ﬂow.

Polchinski’s exact renormalisation group equation for tensors (57) involve the operations of
deriving V with respect to to T and T . At the level of bubble couplings, they respectively
amount to removing a white vertex v and a black vertex v. Then, the contraction with the
derivative of the covariance K connects the resulting edges respecting the colours. Therefore,
when acting on bubble couplings in V ,

is equivalent to a contraction of a pair of vertices, either on two independent couplings (ﬁrst
term) or on the same coupling (second term). At the dual level of triangulation, the ﬂow equation
can be represented graphically as in ﬁgure 8.

Equation (57) translates into a system of equations for the couplings λB. To explicit this
system, it is useful to introduce the inverse operation of a pair contraction, which is called a
cut. A k-cut c in a bubble B is deﬁned as a subset of edges {e1, . . . , ek} of B with diﬀerent
colours. The cut bubble Bc is the bubble obtained from B by cutting the k edges {e1, . . . , ek}
into half-edges, attaching to them a new black v and a new white vertex v and joining v and v
by D − k edges carrying the colors not in {e1, . . . , ek}. Then, it follows that B/vv = B. The

This ensures that Bc is a bubble with D colours.

notion of k-cut with k (cid:54)= D is necessary to deal with the contraction of a pair that is connected
by D − k edges.
In particular, if c is a 0-cut, Bc is just
the disjoint union of B with a dipole. A 1-cut on an edge e is just the insertion on e of a pair
of vertices joined by D − 1 edges carrying the colours diﬀerent from that of e. Substituting
the bubble expansion (59) into the ﬂow equation (57), we arrive at the system of diﬀerential
equations governing the bubble couplings. Thus, the evolution of the couplings reads,

In this equation, the sum runs over k-cuts c for 0 ≤ k ≤ D. The second term involves a
summation over D-cut that increases the number of connected components κ(B) of B and over
ways of writing Bc as a disjoint union of a bubble B(cid:48) containing v and a bubble B(cid:48)(cid:48) containing
v. Finally, let us emphasize that even if the initial potential V0 does not contain non connected
bubbles, the latter are generated by the loop-like term in the ﬂow equation. Furthermore, they
play a key role in the large N limit.

3.4 Large N melonic universality

In order to study the large N limit, we make a change of variables in the couplings,

λB(t) = N δ(B)uB(t).

(62)

δ(B) has to be determined in such a way that the rescaled variables uB are of order unity in N .
The latter play the role of the dimensionless variables in the Wilsonian approach to quantum ﬁeld
theory, with δ analogous to the canonical dimension of a coupling. This amounts to parametrise
the potential as

V (t, T, T ) =

N δ(B)uB(t)

TrB(T , T ).

This change of variables factorizes the leading order behaviour of the bubble couplings in the
large N limit.

Since the covariance involves the dipole and the latter could as well be considered as an
interaction, invariance under shifts of part of the covariance into the interaction requires that
the constant K be written as K = N δ(
). In a more general discussion, a multiplicative factor
that admit a ﬁnite limit when N → ∞ could be included. For our purposes, this is irrelevant
and we choose this constant to be 1.
The couplings uB are ﬁnite at large N if the obey a renormalisation group equation involving

so that in the large N limits the couplings uB are ﬁnite and solely determined by β0. To

where κ(B) is the number of connected components of the bubble B and v(B) its total number
of vertices.

The tree-like term (second term in the previous equation) is independent of N because v(B) =
v(B(cid:48)) + v(B(cid:48)(cid:48)) − 2 and κ(B) = κ(B(cid:48)) + κ(B(cid:48)(cid:48)) − 1. The power of N in the loop-like term (ﬁrst
term in the previous equation) can be written as

δ(Bc) + D − k − δ(B) − δ(

(68)

where κ(B, c) is deﬁned as the number of connected components of B containing edges of the
cut, except for a D-cut that increases the number of connected components of B, in which case
κ(B, c) = 0. This implies that κ(Bc) = κ(B)− κ(B, c) + 1. This exponent is negative if we choose
α = D, β = −1 and γ = 0, but other choices are possible, see the discussion in [28]. Then, the

We always have k ≥ κ(B, c) and k = κ(B, c) if and only if all edges of the cut belong to diﬀerent
connected components of B. In particular, this holds for any 0-cut and any 1-cut. The evolution
equations for low order bubble couplings are given in appendix A.1 for D = 3 and in appendix
A.2 for D = 4.

(D=2), the large N limit is equivalent to the equation derived in [26]

Since the exponent of N in (69) is negative, the limit N → ∞ can be taken. For matrices
In this regime, only D-cut that disconnects the graph or k-cut with each edge in distinct
connected components (including the 0-cuts) survive. Staring with the empty bubble coupling

u∅, that corresponds to log Z, only melonic bubbles are generated when solving iteratively (69)
in powers of t − t0. Recall that a bubble M is said to be melonic if, for every white vertex v,
there is a black vertex v such that the removal of v and v increases the number of connected
components by D − 1.
Consequently, there is a kind of melonic universality: Whatever the initial couplings uB(t0)
are, the large N partition function only depends on the melonic couplings uM(t0). Thus, as
far as the partition function is concerned, non melonic bubbles are irrelevant. The partition
function is all we need to compute the expectation value of a bubble since

If B is melonic, the derivative ∂u∅(t)

If B is
not melonic, then it is suppressed by negative powers N . Taking the second derivative of log Z
shows that the expectation value of a product of melonic bubbles factorizes at leading order. The
actual computation of this expectation value is performed in 4.4. Note that melonic universality
holds for any D, including the matrix model case D = 2, for which all interactions are melonic.
However, the Gaußian ansatz presented in section 4.4 does not hold for matrices. This techniques
also allow to show the large N Gaußian nature of the correlation functions for random tensors,
see [23].

∂uB(t0) is of order unity.

3.5 Group ﬁeld theory

We consider now tensorial group ﬁeld theories, analogous to tensor models, provided we replace
rank D tensors by functions over D copies of a group G,

Ti1,...,iD → Φ(g1, . . . , gD)

T i1,...,iD → Φ(g1, . . . , gD).

Let us determine the system of equations satisﬁed by the bubble couplings λB. These involves
k-cuts c on the edges of B. Recall that a k-cut is a subset of k edges of distinct colours, with
i1, . . . , iD−k the colours of the edge not in the cut. We cut these edges, attach two new vertices vc
and vc and complete the graph by connecting these vertices by D − k edges ei1, . . . , eik carrying
the colours not in the cut. We denote by Bc the resulting bubble and, if k = D and if Bc has

This expression is not very illuminating, but interesting consequences can be drawn from it in
speciﬁc models. In the next two section, we investigate the case of Abelian models with closure
constraints and SU(2) models in the spin network basis.

3.6 Scaling and renormalisation for Abelian models with closure constraint

In this section, we consider Abelian models based on the group U(1)d. Elements of U(1) are
written as g = exp 2iπ θ
L with θ ∈ [0, L], with L being a length. The covariance is of heat kernel

This equation is the group ﬁeld theory analogue of (55) in the framework of quantum ﬁeld
theory. Note that because of the closure constraint, the bubble couplings are only deﬁned on
subspaces of momentum space such that the sum of momenta incident to any vertex is 0. We
further assume L to be large enough (1/L (cid:28) Λ) so that momenta can be treated as continuous
variables. Then we can trade sums for integrals

(cid:90)

(cid:88)

and

(cid:88)
δ(cid:80) pi,0 → Ldδ(

(80)

Otherwise, a more precise but cumbersome analysis can be performed using the Poisson resum-
mation. Finally, we also allow derivatives of the bubble couplings with respect to momenta and
impose rotational invariance in momentum space. This last hypothesis is fulﬁlled if we assume
that the initial couplings are invariant under rotation since the propagator is.

To understand the large Λ behaviour, we repeat the steps followed in 3.4. Let us introduce

the analogue of dimensionless bubble couplings uB deﬁned by

λB({pe} , Λ) = ΛδB uB({qe} , Λ)

with

pe = Λqe.

(81)

δ(B) is not the dimension as would be derived by rescaling all lengths, L included. It is merely
a scaling dimension for large Λ that encodes the dominant behaviour of λB.

(83)

Then, the large Λ behaviour is entirely governed (at least in perturbation theory) by β0. To this
aim, let us search for a suitable scaling dimension for the bubble interactions in the form

δ(B) = α + βκ(B) + γv(B).

(84)

22

T. Krajewski and R. Toriumi

The exponent in the tree-like term is

δ(B(cid:48)) + δ(B(cid:48)(cid:48)) − δ(B) − 2 − d = α + β + 2γ − 2 − d,

while for the loop like term it is

δ(Bc) − δ(B) − 2 + d(D − d = −dk − βκ(B, c) + β + 2γ − 2 + d(D − 1),

(85)

(86)

where we recall that κ(B, c) is the number of connected components of B containing edges of the
cut. Setting α = d(D − 1), β = −d, and 2γ = d(D − 2)− 2, the tree-like term vanishes while the
loop-like one is d(κ(B), c) − k, thus always negative. Therefore, the couplings uB are governed
by an ﬂow equation that only involves negative powers of Λ. This leads to a scaling dimension

δ(B) = d(D − 1) − dκ(B) −

d(D − 2) − 2

.

(87)

For connected bubbles, this is the scaling dimension found in [12] by Carrozza, Oriti and Ri-
vasseau using multiscale analysis.

Assuming that the general picture presented in section 3.1 for quantum ﬁeld theory remains
valid, perturbatively renormalisable interactions correspond to relevant and marginal interac-
tions, or equivalently δ(B) ≥ 0. This leads us to only ﬁve values of D and d for which such
interactions can be found. Indeed, if we also take into account the term associated with rescaling

acterised by

δ(B, n) = (D − 1)d − κ(B) d −

(cid:2)(D − 2)d − 2(cid:3) v(B)

2 − n ≥ 0.

In particular, among all the renormalisable interactions, we always have the mass term δ
and for the kinetic term δ

,2 = 0.

Let us end by listing all renormalisable interactions in Abelian models with a closure con-
straint. The condition δB ≥ 0 implies vB ≤ 2 +
d(D−2)−2 . Non trivial interactions involve bubbles
with at most four vertices, so that we are left with only two possibilities: d(D − 2) = 4 and
d(D − 2) = 3, which leads to the following 5 renormalisable theories. This list, with connected
interactions only, was ﬁrst obtained in [12] using the multiscale analysis of Feynman graphs.

• D = 3 and d = 4 so that δ = 8 − 4κ − v. The renormalisable interactions is quartic and

melonic.

(δ = 0)

The ﬁxed point structure of a non Abelian version of this model has been studied in [27]

• D = 4 and d = 2 so that δ = 6 − 2κ − v. The renormalisable interactions are quartic

(δ = 0),

(δ = 0)

123123ERGE and loop equations for tensor models

23

Note that the second interaction is not melonic (called necklace in [28]).

• D = 6 and d = 1 so that δ = 5 − κ − v. The renormalisable interactions are quartic

(δ = 0),

(δ = 0),

(δ = 0).

The last two interactions are not melonic. This model was shown to be renormalisable in
[29] and [30] and its ﬁxed point structure was further investigated in [31].

• D = 3 and d = 3 so that δ = 6 − 3κ − v/2. The renormalisable interactions are quartic

and sextic

(δ = 1),

(δ = 0),

(δ = 0),

(δ = 0).

The ﬁrst term is in fact superrenormalisable (δ > 0) and the last one is not melonic. Its non
Abelian counterpart is the tensorial SU(2) group ﬁeld theory in D = 3 which corresponds
to three dimensional Euclidian quantum gravity without the cosmological constant, ﬁrst
shown to be renormalisable in [12].

• D = 5 and d = 1 so that δ = 4 − κ − v/2. The renormalisable interactions are quartic and

sextic. We ﬁrst have the melonic ones

(δ = 1),

(δ = 0),

(δ = 0),

(δ = 0).

The last interaction is not connected (κ = 2). This model, with the non connected
interaction, was shown to be renormalizable in [29]. Besides, there are also non melonic
renormalisable interactions.

Note that all these bubble couplings with v ≥ 4 have dimension 0 or 1, so that there is no
possibility of adding a derivative coupling. Indeed, the latter corresponds to a term with n > 0
in (89), which would lead to a negative dimension, the case n = 1 being forbidden by rotational
symmetry. Of course, we could always add quadratic terms (mass and kinetic terms) to the list
of interaction. Then, the kinetic term can play the role of a derivative coupling.

It is also worthwhile to notice that some of the renormalisable interactions are not necessary
melonic. As for unitarily invariant random tensors, non melonic interactions appear with a
negative power of Λ in the ﬂow of renormalisable melonic interactions. Therefore, they do not
require renormalisation if the bare theory only contains melonic interactions. However, if the
bare theory contains non melonic renormalisable interactions, the latter requires renormalisation.

3.7 SU(2) models in the spin network basis

In the SU(2) case which is involved in many spin-foam models, it is possible to expand all the
bubble couplings on spin networks, see [32], rather than just bubbles. For the group SU(2), spin
network observables provide a nice basis. We work with the heat kernel

Let us emphasize the analogy with (79), the spin playing the role of the momenta. The constraint
is implemented by the insertion of the interwiner ι at the two vertices created by the cut.
Consequently, it acts as a constraint since we can cut some edges only if their spins admit an
intertwiner. For D = 3 this constraint is the triangle inequality. It is also interesting to note
the similarity with the tensor model case, with the factor N D−k replaced by the product over
the D − k edges not in the cut of the dimensions djl.
3.8 Wetterich’s equation and non trivial ﬁxed points

The search for non trivial ﬁxed points in group ﬁeld theories have been investigated by several
authors. We give here a very brief account of the rationale behind these works since they also
make use of exact renormalisation group equations. We refer the reader to the original literature
[27], [33], [31] and [34] for the precise calculations and the phase diagrams.

These works use Wetterich’s equation (97), expanded as,

In this framework, a heat kernel type of covariance is used and the eﬀective average action Γ is
expanded over bubble couplings as in (27). Then, (97) is expanded a series of colour 0 one loop
graphs whose vertices are the D-bubbles in the expansion of Γ.

coupling pertaining to a given bubble B in terms of all the bubbles in the chain B1, . . . ,Bn, it
is therefore necessary to ﬁnd all such possible chains of bubbles. This is solved by the following
algorithm, involving a sequence of n cuts since they are the inverse of inverse operation of a
contraction of a line of color 0.

1. The ﬁrst cut c1 is arbitrary and results in Bc1, with two new vertices v1 and v1. This cut
determines the insertion of the derivative of the covariance K, materialised by a cross in
ﬁgure 11.

2. The next cuts c2, . . . , cn must always increase the number of connected components (there-
fore they involve all D colors) with the constraint that each new connected component
contains 1 or 2 new vertices vi and vj. If the ﬁrst cut has not increased the number of
connected components, all the cuts have to be performed on the connected component of
Bc1 containing v1 and v1; otherwise they may be performed anywhere.

3. Partition the set of connected components of Bc1...cn into n sets, each of which containing
one of the white vertices and one of the black vertices previously constructed in such a
way that joining corresponding vertices leads to a cycle of colour 0 lines.

4. The n sets of the partition deﬁne the n bubbles B1, . . . ,Bn
As is usual, for a given bubble there is a maximal value of n, if we exclude the trivial cuts
involving all the D edges incident to a given vertex. Except for the ﬁrst cut, this kind of cut
simply amounts to an insertion of a chain of dipoles which may be removed by a change in the
propagator.

To search for ﬁxed points, one usually resorts to truncations. It means that we select a few
couplings, usually including the the mass m2Φ · Φ and the kinetic term (Z − 1)Φ · ∆Φ, both
associated to the dipole graph, as well as some interactions bubble couplings expanded around

zero momentum (in Abelian theories). For instance, in the model considered by Benedetti and
Lahoche in [31] in D = 6 with the group U(1), only the interaction associated to the quartic
melon given in ﬁgure 12 has been retained. We focus now on this model and review brieﬂy their
work. In this case, the ﬂow equations reduce to the system

(101)

The wave function renormalisation is not a coupling and one has to rescale the ﬁelds as Φ →
Z−1/2Φ and Φ → Z−1/2Φ in order to have ﬁxed points. Second, it is also necessary to rescale
m and λ according to their scaling dimension for large t,

λ = et(6−D)Z2λ,

m2 = e2tZm2.

(102)

Note that 6 − D is the scaling dimension of the bubble
Finally, determining Z in terms of m and λ leads to a system of equations

found in equation (89), with Λ ∝ et.

(104)

Although non autonomous (i.e. still involving t) because of the ﬁnite size of the group, there are
ﬁxed points in the limit t → ∞. Besides the Gaußian one with m = 0 and λ = 0, there are two
others ﬁxed points. One of them cannot be connected to the Gaußian one by a trajectory because
of the presence of a singularity. The other one has one relevant and one irrelevant direction. It
corresponds to a negative value of m2, possibly indicating a phase transition. Similar results
have been obtained by the other authors mentioned at the beginning of this section.

4 Loop equations

4.1 Reparametrisation invariance in quantum ﬁeld theory

To begin with, let us consider again a general quantum ﬁeld theory whose ﬁelds are collectively
denoted by φi. The basic object of interest is the generating function for correlation functions,
which we write symbolically as

(cid:90)

Z[J] =

[Dφ] exp{−S[φ] + Jφ} .

(105)

ERGE and loop equations for tensor models

27

In this section, we consider formal algebraic relations satisﬁed by the generating function, treat-
ing the ﬁeld as a ﬁnite dimensional variable for simplicity. This is enough for the heuristic
purpose of this following presentation.

Because it is an integral over all ﬁelds, the generating functional Z[J] must be invariant under
any change of variables in the space of ﬁelds, a property known as reparametrisation invariance.
Consider an inﬁnitesimal change of variable, which we write as

Invariance of Z[J] under such a change of variable translates into the equation

φi → φi + X i[φ].

The ﬁrst term is the Jacobian of the change of variable and the two others arise from the
variation of the argument of the exponential. Since every function of the ﬁeld can be obtained
as a derivative acting on the source, we arrive at

Z[J] = 0.

associated to X and Y . Therefore, the operators L deﬁne a representation of the Lie algebra of
inﬁnitesimal change of variables.
When the vector ﬁeld X is independent of φ, the associated change of variable is simply a

4.2 Loop equations for tensor models

Let us apply the general framework depicted in the previous section to unitarily invariant random
tensor models. These equations where ﬁrst derived by Gurau in [35] at leading order and at all
order in [17]. We follow the presentation given in [36].

We start with an interaction of the form given in (7), except that we do not include the

combinatorial factor,

V (T, T ) =

λB TrB(T , T ).

(114)

The inclusion of the combinatorial factor CT is immaterial since it amounts to trading λB for
λB
CB . Here, we have included all bubbles, even non connected ones and the empty one. The latter
is simply a constant λ∅ that does not couple to the tensors. Then, solving the theory amounts
to computing the partition function as a function of all the bubble couplings,

{λB}

dµC(T, T ) exp−V (T, T ),
with a diagonal covariance C = t δi1i1 ··· δiDiD
. This has to be considered as a formal power
series in the variables λB, ordered by the number of vertices of the bubbles, in such a way that
at a given order there is only a ﬁnite number of terms. The expectation value of a bubble is
then obtained by

= −

(cid:17)

If only a subset of bubble couplings are present in the actual potential, all couplings not present
in the potential have to be set to 0 after the derivation.

For unitarily invariant models, there is a preferred set of change of variables parametrised
by bubbles with a vertex removed. Indeed, if v is a black vertex, then we deﬁne TrB\v(T , T )
as TrB(T , T ) with the tensor T at v removed. Treating T and T as independent variables, the
change of variables associated with B\v is

T → T + B\v TrB\v(T , T ),

T → T ,

(117)

with B\v an inﬁnitesimal parameter. Performing this change of variables in(115) leads to the

identity(cid:90)

(118)

For any bubble B, recall that B/vv is the bubble with the pair of vertices vv contracted (see
ﬁgure 2) and l(B, v, v) is the number of edges in B that connect v and v. The ﬁrst two terms
arise from the change of the Gaußian measure, the second one being the Jacobian. The third
term comes from the change of the potential. Note that the contribution of the covariance is of
the same form as that of the dipole, considered as an bubble coupling.
Writing this equation in terms of bubble expectation values, it reads

Considering a bubble in the potential as a triangulation of a space of dimension D−1. Then, has
the following interpretation. On a boundary triangulation, consider the simplex of dimension D−
1 labelled by vertex v. Then, the expectation of such a boundary triangulation is a combination
of the expectation values for which this triangle is connected to another triangle on the same
boundary triangulation or in a diﬀerent one, see ﬁgure 13. The power of N counts the number
of simplices of dimension D− 2 that are shared by the two simplices that we indentify, see ﬁgure
14. Low powers of N correspond to topology changes, so that the latter are expected to be
subdominant.

Since a bubble expectation can be generated by derivation with respect to a bubble coupling,
the previous equation can be written as a diﬀerential operator acting on the partition function

These equations are constraints on the partition function expressed as diﬀerential operators with

respect to the couplings. They are tensor analogues of the loop equations for matrix models,
which are recovered when D = 2, see section 4.3.

The commutation relation between two such diﬀerential operators reads

(122)

and simply reproduce the commutation relation between two changes of variables of the form
(117). These operators generate a Lie algebra whose structure is related to a Connes-Kreimer
algebra, see [37].

By the same token, removing a white vertex on a bubble deﬁnes a change of variables for the

conjugate tensor

T → T,

T → T + +B\v TrB\v(T , T ).

(123)

It leads to an analogous equation LB\v Z = 0. The operators LB\v obey similar commutations
relations and commute with LB\v,

(cid:2)

\v(cid:48)(cid:3) = 0,

LB\v,LB

(cid:48)

(124)

because we treat T and T as independent variables.

In our derivation of the constraints, we have included all possible bubble couplings in the
action, even for non connected bubbles and for the empty one. However, most of the authors
do not consider such couplings. The empty bubble can only appear as B/vv when B is a dipole.
∂
If the empty bubble is not present in the action, we assume that
∂λ∅ is the identity. If we start
with only connected bubble couplings, non connected ones can appear only in the Jacobian.
The latter can be generated by higher order derivations on the connected ones. Indeed, let us
denote by (B/vv)c the connected componenents of B/vv. Then, we simply have to replace the
diﬀerential operators by

LB\v =

t−1 ∂

(125)

This is in general a diﬀerential operator of order > 1. Nevertheless, the form of the loop
equations and all commutation relations remain unchanged.

4.3 The case of matrix models

When D = 2, coloured tensor models reduce to a theory of complex non hermitian matrices of
size N . In this case, connected bubble are just indexed by a integer n which is the equal number
of black and white vertices. Then, connected bubble invariants are just traces of the nth power
of M†M and the potential is

∞(cid:88)

λnTr(cid:0)M†M(cid:1)n,

V (M, M†) = λ0 +

(126)

n=1

where we have included the empty bubble with n = 0. The change of variable associated to a
bubble with a black vertex removed (see (117)) is
M† → M†,

M → M + n M(cid:0)M†M(cid:1)n−1,

(127)

ERGE and loop equations for tensor models

31

for n > 1.

To ﬁnd the explicit form of the diﬀerential operators LB\v (121), ﬁrst consider the case of a

dipole, n = 1. Then, B/vv is empty and we get

or two connected components (if v and v are not adjacent). This leads to

This is nothing but the commutation relation of the operators xn ∂
∂x , known as the Witt algebra.
After a shift n → n+1 and introducing an extra operator L−1, these are the Virasoro constraints,
see [38].
Finally, it may be interesting to note that the Witt algebra also appears as a subalgebra of

the constraint algebra of the tensor models. Indeed, if we deﬁne

LB\v,

(136)

(cid:88)

Ln =

with n(B) the number of white vertices of B, then the commutation relation (122) implies those
of the Witt algebra (135).

4.4 An application to melonic dominance

In section 3.4, we have shown that only melonic couplings contribute at leading order to the
partition function, provided each bubble coupling is written as λB = N D−1uB, considering only
connected bubbles for simplicity. Then, Dyson-Schwinger equations can be used to evaluate

32

T. Krajewski and R. Toriumi

the expectation value of such a bubble, see [18]. Indeed, with only melonic bubbles M, (119)

reduces to(cid:10)TrM(T, T )(cid:11) =

(137)

Let us make the Ansatz that the expectation value is of Gaussian type with a yet to be deter-
mined covariance G(t,{uM

(cid:48)}) depending on all melonic couplings in V ,

(cid:10)TrM(T, T )(cid:11) = N Gn(M)

(138)

with n(M) the equal number of black or white vertices of M. We also assume that the integral
for a product of melonic bubbles factorizes in the large N limit. Then (137) reduces, for D > 2,
to

−t−1Gn(M) + Gn(M)−1 −

n(M(cid:48))uM Gn(M

(cid:48))+n(M)−1 = 0.

(139)

(cid:88)

(cid:48)
M

The assumption D > 2 is crucial here since in this case there is a single v such that the
contribution of the second term in (137) is dominant, with all others subdominant.

This equation is solved if

G = t + t

n(M(cid:48))uM

(cid:48) Gn(M

(cid:48)) = 0.

If a ﬁnite number of bubbles are present in the action, an explicit perturbative expansion of G
in terms of the couplings can be obtained by a recursive solution, starting with G = t at lowest
order.

5 Conclusion and outlook

In this survey, we have presented the exact renormalisation groups equations and the loop
equations for random tensors and group ﬁeld theories. Exact renormalisation group equations
are powerful devices that allow to classify the interactions according to their degree of relevancy
in a speciﬁed limit. For unitarily invariant tensor models, the most relevant interactions are the
melonic ones. In group ﬁeld theory case in the limit of large cut-oﬀ, the theory is governed by
renormalisable interactions. On the other side, loop equations are constraints on the partition
function arising from reparametrisation invariance.

It is fair to say that the applications of these equations to tensor models and group ﬁeld
theories has not yet been completely explored. Recent works by various groups suggest the
following research directions.

• The group ﬁeld theories we have presented are based on abelian groups. However, powerful
techniques based on the heat kernel have been developed by Carrozza, Oriti and Rivasseau
in [39], [40] and [41] in the context of multiscale analysis. It would certainly be very useful
to adapt these techniques to ﬂow equations. This would also be particularly useful in the
renormalisation of D = 4 group ﬁeld theories related to general relativity.

• Most of the works presented here is of perturbative nature. However, exact renormal-
isation group equations, especially Wetterich’s one, can be used in the nonperturbative
regime. Ben Geloun, Benedetti, Carrozza, Lahoche and Oriti have already investigated
the existence of ﬁxed points using truncations.

ERGE and loop equations for tensor models

33

• Melonic interactions turn out to be the most relevant ones. Nevertheless, the eﬀects of
non melonic ones have not yet been understood. This is particularly true in group ﬁeld
theories where some models exhibit non melonic interaction of scaling dimension 0.

• Loop equations play a fundamental role in the theory of random matrices, establishing
the relation with conformal ﬁeld theory and integrable hierarchies. It would be of high
interest to establish similar connections in the case of random tensors.
