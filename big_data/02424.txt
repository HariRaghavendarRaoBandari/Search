Abstract
Excitation functions were measured for production of the 113,111,110Sn, 115m,114m,113m,112m,111g,110gIn and 111m,109Cd ra-
dioisotopes by bombardment of In targets with proton beams up to 70 MeV, some of them for the ﬁrst time. The new
results are compared with the earlier experimental data and with the theoretical data in the TENDL-2014 (Talys1.6
based) library. Thick target yields were deduced and application of the new data for production of medically relevant
110mIn, 111gIn, 113mIn and 114mIn, as well as applicability for thin layer activation (TLA) are discussed.

1. Introduction

the 113,111,110Sn,

radionuclides.

natIn(p,x)110Sn→110mIn,

The aim of the present work was to measure more
accurate and new cross sections for the production
115m,114m,113m,112m,111g,110gIn and
of
111m,109Cd radioisotopes. We also investigated the
production capabilities of diagnostic and therapeutic
radionuclides 110mIn, 111gIn, 113mIn and 114mIn through
natIn(p,x)111Sn→111gIn,
the
natIn(p,xn)113Sn→113mIn and natIn(p,x)114mIn reactions,
in the frame of a systematic study of charged particle
production routes of medical
The
experimental data eﬀectively contribute to practical
applications via production of recommended cross
sections in optimal energy ranges and derived yield
data for production of the particular radioisotope for
application purposes. Another important result of
the present study, the applicability of the new data in
the ﬁeld of wear measurements by using thin layer
activation (TLA) is also discussed in the Application
section.
The cross section data for production of
some of these radioisotopes were investigated by us
earlier
in detail using diﬀerent production routes:
For production of 110Sn and for direct production
of 110mIn we published investigations in (Ali et al.,
2014; Hermanne et al., 2010a; Szelecs´enyi et al.,
1990, 1991; Tak´acs et al., 2010; T´ark´anyi et al., 2011,

∗Corresponding author: ditroi@atomki.hu

2006, 2007, 2015, 2004). Data for production of
111gIn were reported in (Hermanne et al., 2014b,a,
2006; Szelecs´enyi et al., 1994; T´ark´anyi et al., 2011,
2006, 1994, 2005b). For production of 113Sn and for
direct production of 113mIn we have already presented
results on natCd(p,xn)113mIn
related experimental
natCd(d,xn)113In
(T´ark´anyi et al., 2005a, 2006),
(T´ark´anyi et al., 2007), 114Cd(d,3n)113mIn (T´ark´anyi
et al., 2005b), natCd(3He,xn)113Sn (Szelecs´enyi et al.,
natSn(p,x)113Sn (Hermanne et al., 2006),
1991),
natCd(α,xn)113Sn (Hermanne et al., 2010a) and recently
the natIn(d,x)113Sn reaction (T´ark´anyi et al., 2011). We
have investigated the production routes of 114mIn in
(Hermanne et al., 2014b, 2010b; T´ark´anyi et al., 2011,
2006, 2007, 2005b). We were involved in diﬀerent
IAEA CRP projects to produce recommended cross
data for production 111gIn, 114mIn in (Gul et al., 2001;
Qaim et al., 2011; T´ark´anyi et al., 2001). Production
of recommended data for 110mIn production is also
included in the ongoing IAEA CRP (Nichols and
Capote Noy, 2013). Searching of the literature for
nuclear reaction data of proton induced reactions on
indium showed only a few earlier experimental cross
section and thick target yield data determinations.
Cross section data were reported by (Nortier et al.,
1990) for production of 109,110,111,113Sn up to 100 MeV,
by (Nortier et al., 1991) for 109Sn, 109In, 109Cd up to
200 MeV, by (Lundqvist et al., 1991) up to 85 MeV

for 115Sn up to 5.8 MeV. Thick target yield data were
reported by (Dmitriev and Molin, 1981) for 113Sn up to
22 MeV, by (Dmitriev et al., 1982) for 113Sn and 114mIn
at 22 MeV and by (Nickles, 1991) for 113mIn and 115mIn
at 11 MeV.

2. Experimental

This study includes three irradiations at three dif-
ferent laboratories. All cross section measurements of
proton induced reactions on natIn were done by using
the activation method and stacked foil irradiation tech-
nique. Irradiations of commercial indium metal foil tar-
gets were performed at external beams of diﬀerent cy-
clotrons. The ﬁrst irradiation was done in 2006 at an
external beam of CYRIC AVF 110 (Sendai, Japan) cy-
clotron at 70 MeV, for 1h at 58 nA beam intensity. The
stack contained 13 stacked sets of Er(25 µm), Co(50
µm), Al(10 µm), In(50 µm) and Al(100 µm) foils. The
covered energy range for Indium was 69.5-59.4 MeV.
(The planned covered energy range was larger but by
mistake the intended 500 µm Al absorbers were not in-
serted behind each set). The second irradiation was per-
formed in 2014 at the LLN Cyclone 90 cyclotron (Bel-
gium) with 65 MeV protons, for 1 h at 35 nA beam in-
tensity. The stack contained 19 sets of 10 µm Al, 116
µm In, 99.2 µm Al, 8.41 µm V, 99.2 µm Al, 26.2 µm Ho
and 99.2 µm Al. The Al foils in both irradiations served
as monitors and to detect the possible recoils. The me-
dian proton energy in the last In-foil in the stack was
37.5 MeV. The third stack was irradiated at the VUB
CGR 560 (Brussels, Belgium) cyclotron at 35 MeV pri-
mary energy and 50 nA beam intensity for 1 h. The
stack contained 16 sets of 10 µm Al, 116 µm In, 16 µm
Au and 11 µm Ti foils. The Ti foils served as monitors.
The covered energy range for the indium was 33.3-8.9
MeV.

The stacks were mounted in a Faraday cup like tar-
get holder equipped with a long collimator. The ac-
tivity of all produced radionuclides, both in the target
material, and in the Al-backings/degraders and in the
monitor foils were measured with HPGe detectors. The
activity of the irradiated samples was measured nonde-
structively, without chemical separation. The source-
detector distance was kept large enough to minimize
dead time and pile up eﬀects and possible inﬂuence of
the non point-like geometry of the samples compared
to calibration situations. Measurements were started
1 day after EOB in CYRIC due to the high radiation
dose, at nearly EOB+10 h for irradiations at LLN due
the high dose and to needed transport of the irradiated

target to VUB. In case of these two high energy irradia-
tions hence only longer-lived activation products could
be identiﬁed. For the experiments at VUB also shorter-
lived products could be identiﬁed as the ﬁrst measure-
ments started at EOB + 0.3 h. Measurements were re-
peated a few times over a time period of several weeks
to assess the low activities of longer-lived radioisotopes
and to follow the decay of the produced radionuclides.
In case of high energy, multi-target irradiations, the
large number of diﬀerent targets and the limited de-
tector capacity made the optimization of gamma spec-
tra measurements practically impossible. Gamma spec-
tra were evaluated by using (Canberra, 2000; Sz´ekely,
1985) evaluation software. The complex spectra require
iterative evaluation, by using theoretical predictions and
preliminary experimental results. The natural element
indium contains two stable isotopes: 113In with 4.3 %
abundance and 115In with 95.7 % abundance. There-
fore, above some reaction thresholds only the so-called
elemental cross-sections could be determined. Direct
and cumulative cross-sections were calculated depend-
ing on the contributing processes and the activity mea-
surements by using standard activation and decay for-
mulas. The nuclear decay data used are collected in
the Table 1 and were taken from (NuDat, 2014). For
metastable states the energy level above ground is in-
dicted in the ﬁrst column. The reaction Q-values were
determined by using the NNDC Q-value calculator (Pri-
tychenko and Sonzogni, 2003).

Number of incident particles was initially derived
from the charge collected on the Faraday target hold-
ers in the three experiments. Correction of these values
were made based on re-measurement of the cross sec-
tions of the monitor reactions natAl(p,x)22,24Na over the
whole energy range and comparison with recommended
data (Fig. 1) taken from IAEA-TECDOC-1211 (Gul
et al., 2001). The incident beam energy on the targets
was initially derived from accelerator settings and by
calculation of the energy degradation in the target stack
(Andersen and Ziegler, 1977). These results in the de-
termination of incident energy were checked and cor-
rected by assuring overlap of the excitation functions
of the used monitor reactions with the recommended
data according to (T´ark´anyi et al., 2001). The num-
ber of the target nuclei was deduced from the thick-
ness of the target. The thickness of individual tar-
gets was determined from the surface and of the mass
of the target and the monitor foils. The uncertainty
on the cross section values was estimated by the stan-
dard technique according to the recommendations of
the ISO guide (1993)(International-Bureau-of-Weights-
and-Measures, 1993). The included experimental un-

certainties are: number of target nuclei including non-
uniformity (5 %), incident particle ﬂux (7 %), peak area
including statistical errors on counts (0.1-20 %), detec-
tor eﬃciency (5 %), γ-ray abundance and branching ra-
tio data ( 1 %, varies). Except for a few data points
the total uncertainty of 10-15 % was obtained as posi-
tive square root of the quadratic sum of the individual
sources. Possible additional uncertainties due to non-
linear eﬀects of half-lives and waiting time were not
accounted for. The monitoring method allows estimat-
ing the uncertainty on the primary beam energy at ± 0.2
MeV but the uncertainty on the average energy in each
foil is continuously rising through the stack and attains
± 1.5 MeV for the last foil due to cumulative possible
variations on target thickness and energy degradation.

3. Results

3.1. Production cross sections

The new experimental data are discussed for the dif-
ferent activation products separately in the next para-
graphs. Numerical values for the cross sections (di-
rect or cumulative) are presented in Tables 2-3 and in
Figures 2-10. Results of diﬀerent irradiations will be
presented separately in the ﬁgures. The new experi-
mental results are compared with the data found in the
literature and with the theoretical calculations in the
TENDL-2014 (Koning et al., 2014) TALYS based (Kon-
ing and Rochman, 2012) library. The cross sections
were evaluated using the average of the strong indepen-
dent gamma-lines (when those were consistent) for ev-
ery investigated radionuclide. The selection criteria of
gamma-lines involved in the average calculation were:

no interference with other gamma-lines/isotopes; suit-
able statistic, which means that not always the same set
of gamma-lines could be used for the same isotope in
the diﬀerent experiments.

3.1.1. Production of 113Sn

The 113Sn isotope has a long-lived (115.09 d) ground
state and a short-lived metastable state (21.4 min),
which could not be assessed reliably in our experiments.
We present hence the cumulative production of 113gSn
after total decay of the isomeric state (IT 91.1 %). The
113In(p,n) and 115In(p,3n) reactions can contribute to the
formation of this isotope and we can hence observe on
Fig. 2 an excitation function with two expected maxima.
According to Fig. 2 there is a good agreement between
all experimental data and the theoretical results.

3.1.2. Production of 111Sn

New cross section data for production of the 111Sn
(35.3 min, 7/2+) were obtained only from the low en-
ergy irradiation (VUB), where the reduced dose and
the logistic circumstances allowed to use short cooling
time after EOB. The cross sections of 113In(p,3n) reac-
tion were hence measured practically up to the threshold
of the 115In(p,5n) reaction (Q = -36664.46 keV). The
agreement with the earlier experimental data and with
the theory is good (see Fig. 3).

3.1.3. Production of 110Sn

The excitation functions for production of 110Sn (4.11
h) are shown in Fig. 4 in comparison with the earlier ex-
perimental data of (Nortier et al., 1990) and (Lundqvist
et al., 1991). The agreement in the whole energy range
is good, except the last 4 point of the CYRIC results,

The Q-values shown in Table 1 refer to the formation of the ground state. Increase absolute Q-values for isomeric states with level energy of the isomer. When complex particles are emitted instead of individual protons and neutrons
the absolute Q-values have to be decreased by the respective binding energies of the compound particles: np-d, +2.2 MeV; 2np-t, +8.48 MeV; 2p2n-α, +28.30 MeV.

which was possibly caused by the inhomogeneity in the
target foils accumulating a systematic shift towards the
end of the stack. The theory underestimates the cross
section of the 115In(p,6n) reaction at high energies.

3.1.4. Production of 115mIn

The 115In isotope has a very long-lived (4.41E+14
a) ground state and one shorter-lived metastable state
(4.486 h). We present cross section data for the produc-
tion of the isomeric state (Fig. 5) decaying overwhelm-
ingly (IT = 95 %) by internal transition to the ground

reaction is the only contributing reaction. Our exper-
imental results follow the TENDL prediction in shape
but the magnitude is higher. The decay of the long-lived
ground state could not be assessed in our experiments.

3.1.5. Production of 114mIn

The radioisotope 114In has a short-lived ground state
(71.9 s) and a long-lived (49.51 d) metastable state,
which decays with 96.7 % by IT to the ground state and
with 3.3 % by EC to stable 114Cd. Only the production
cross section of the longer-lived metastable state was
determined. According to Fig. 6 the measured and theo-
retical data are similar in shape, but TENDL-2014 over-
estimates the experimental cross section data at higher
energies. The production of 114mIn is the result of direct
(p,pn) reaction on 115In.

3.1.6. Production of 113mIn

The 99.476 min half-life metastable state of 113In can
be produced only directly via the 115In(p,p2n) reaction
and from the decay of 113gSn. The metastable state de-
cays by 100 % IT to the stable ground state 113gIn.
For measurements shortly after EOB in growth from the
long-lived parent 113Sn (115 d) can be neglected (the
113mSn EC decay leads to 113In ground state) and hence
we present here the direct formation. In average there is
a good agreement in the shape between the experimen-
tal data and the theoretical calculations. The TENDL-
2014 slightly, but systematically overestimates the ex-
periment (Fig. 7).

3.1.7. Production of 112mIn

Out of the two isomeric states we could deduce pro-
duction cross sections for the longer-lived, higher lying
state (20.67 min, 156.613 keV) decaying by IT 100 %
to the 14.88 min ground state (Fig. 8) in the low energy
irradiation. There is good correspondence between the
experiment and the theory.

Figure 9: 9. Excitation functions of the natIn(p,x)111gIn cumulative
reaction

3.1.8. Production of 111gIn

The 111In radionuclide has a short-lived (T1/2= 7.7
min) metastable state decaying to the 2.83 d ground
state by IT. The cumulative production after total de-
cay of the metastable state was measured. The forma-
tion of the ground state of 111In contains three contri-
butions: direct production by (p,pxn) reactions, decay
of the short-lived metastable state (isomeric transition
) and decay of the short-lived parent 111Sn (35.3 min).
In average the agreement between the experimental data
and the theoretical calculations is satisfactory (Fig. 9).

3.1.9. Production of 110gIn and 110mIn

The shorter-lived isomeric state (T1/2= 69.1 min,
62.08 keV) decays not into the longer-lived ground state
(T1/2= 4.92 h). The parent 110Sn decays only to the iso-
meric state. The cross sections for short-lived isomeric
state could not be deduced in our high energy experi-
ments due to the long cooling time. The shorter cool-
ing times for the VUB experiment should in principle
have allowed to deduce cross sections for production of
both states, taking into account the contribution from
the 110Sn decay in case of 110mIn. The gamma-lines
of the ground and isomeric states are however practi-
cally identical. We hence only determined the cumula-
tive production cross section for the ground state from
spectra taken after longer cooling times (Fig. 10). The
agreement is acceptable, except the last 4 point of the

mogeneity in the target foils accumulating a systematic

3.1.10. Production of 109In

The measured cumulative cross sections for produc-
tion of 109gIn (4.167 h ) contains the contribution from
total decay of the 109mIn isomeric state (1.34 min, IT:
100 %) and from the decay of the 109Sn parent isotope
(18.0 min, ε: 100 %) (Fig. 11). Rather good agreement
was found between the values of this experiment and
(Nortier et al., 1990) and the TENDL-2014 library.

3.1.11. Production of 111mCd

The 111Cd has a stable ground state and a 48.54 min
metastable state.
In principle two routes are possible
for production of the metastable state: direct production
by In(p,2pxn) reaction and decay chain of the 111Sn (-
22574.38 keV) -111In (100 %)-111mCd(0.005 %), which
is negligible. As our presented data were obtained from
spectra measured a few hours after EOB (short half-life
of 111mCd), the ingrowth from the decay of the longer-

comparison with the model calculations

lived 111gIn is in any case negligible and the cross sec-
tions reﬂect the direct production. The measured and
calculated cross sections are shown in Fig. 12.

3.1.12. Production of 109Cd

In Fig. 13 the cumulative cross sections of long-lived
109Cd (461.4 d) are shown, including direct production
and possible contributions through the 109Sn (18.0 min,
ˆIˇl: 100 %)-109In (4.167 h, EC 95.44 % and β+ 4.56 %)-
109Cd decay chain.

3.2. Integral yields

From excitation functions obtained by a spline ﬁt to
our experimental cross section data integral thick target
yields were calculated and are shown in Fig. 14 as a
function of the energy for the medically relevant 113Sn,

favorable production and decay characteristics these ra-
dioisotopes are also of importance in Thin Layer Activa-
tion technique (TLA) (IAEA-NDS, 2010; Warner et al.,
2010). For 113gSn an acceptable agreement with the re-
sults of (Dmitriev et al., 1975) is seen.

4. Applications

4.1. Medical applications

Various radiopharmaceuticals labeled with 111gIn
(T1/2= 2.81 d, 100 % EC decay) are used in the diagno-
sis of cancer and other diseases through SPECT. How-
ever, in particular for receptor-type studies, the quantiﬁ-
cation of the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical via PET
measurements may be important. For 111gIn the corre-
sponding isotope of choice is the β+-emitter 110mIn (61.3
%). The Auger- electron emitter 113mIn is a candidate
for internal radio-therapy, while recently the favorable

Auger-electron characteristics of 111gIn and 114mIn were
recognized and are used for studies of internal radio-
immunotherapy.

4.1.1. 114mIn

Production routes for 114mIn through proton and
deuteron induced nuclear reactions on cadmium, indium
and tin were measured and reviewed by us (T´ark´anyi
et al., 2005a, 2011, 2006, 2007).
It was shown there
that 114mIn can be produced also by using high energy
reactions on In with high yield. However the product is
not carrier free, which limits its possible applications.

4.1.2. 113mIn

Comparison of production routes of 113mIn and its
113Sn parent were discussed in detail in our previ-
ous work on deuteron induced reactions on indium.
(T´ark´anyi et al., 2011). By investigating all these re-
actions in detail it can be concluded that by direct pro-

duction it is diﬃcult to produce 113In with high radionu-
clidic purity. Large scale production of 113Sn at present
is done via the 112Sn(n,γ) reaction. This route results
in a product of low speciﬁc activity and asks for highly
enriched targets. Promising production routes, utiliz-
ing charged particle beams to reach high speciﬁc ac-
tivities, can be proposed relying on the 111Cd(α,2n),
natCd(α,xn), natCd(3He,xn), 113In(p,n), natIn(p,xn) and
113In(d,2n) nuclear reactions. By intercomparing these
production routes at medium energies the 113In(d,2n)
and natIn(p,xn) reactions are the most productive (Ta-
ble 4). At even higher energies (Ep = 100 MeV) the
natIn(d,xn) reaction is also advantageous.

4.1.3. 111gIn

We made detailed measurements and reviews on the
production routes of the widely used 111gIn (Hermanne
et al., 2014b; T´ark´anyi et al., 2005a, 2006). A re-
view of 111gIn production was recently done (Lahiri

et al., 2013). To avoid radionuclide impurities and en-
sure high speciﬁc activity in practice the 111Cd(p,n) and
112Cd(p,2n) are used, asking for enriched targets and
low to medium energy. The yields and radionuclide pu-
rity are high, but highly enriched targets are required
to avoid the 114mIn long-lived side product. In principle
the 111Cd(d,2n) reaction could be used as the production
yield is slightly higher (if high enough deuteron energy
is available) than what is obtained by using protons. In
practice, however, the deuteron induced reaction can-
not compete with the proton induced reaction for rou-
tine production of 111gIn as only a very limited number
of accelerators can provide the required higher deuteron
beams. The conclusion is nearly the same for use of the
109Ag(α,2n)111In reaction, where natural targets can be
used and no 114mIn side product is formed. The neg-
ative factors are the lower yield and the very limited
availability of alpha beams above 20 MeV. By using
indium target the carrier free products can be reaching
only through indirect methods. The cross section of the
natIn(p,x)111Sn-111gIn process is high in the 20-50 MeV
energy range (200-300 mb). The main disadvantage is
the small batch yield due to the short half-life of the
parent 111Sn (short irradiation time, losses during the
separation).

4.1.4. 110mIn

Comparison of production routes of 110mIn and its
parent 110Sn were also done in recent work dedicated to
this purpose (T´ark´anyi et al., 2015). The 110Sn(110mIn)
generator could be prepared at low and medium en-
ergies with light charged particles via the 113In(p,4n),
natIn(p,xn), 110Cd(α,4n), natCd(α,xn), 110Cd(3He,3n),
natCd(3He,xn) reactions. Each of these routes require
a proper selection of an adapted energy range and high
incident energies. The main advantage of the indirect
method is the high radionuclide purity, which can be
easily assured by the proper irradiation and cooling pa-
rameters. Considering the available commercial accel-
erators, use of the natIn(p,xn)110Sn reaction seems to be
the simplest and most productive method, however it
requires 70-100 MeV accelerators. It should be men-

tioned that the generator can be produced also at lower
energy machines, but it requires highly enriched tar-
gets (T´ark´anyi et al., 2015). For direct production the
110Cd(p,n), 110Cd(d,2n), 107Ag(α,n) and 109Ag(3He,2n)
reactions mean the candidate routes. Lower energy ac-
celerators can be used, but highly enriched targets are
required.

4.2. Thin layer activation (TLA)

Among the investigated reaction products, the pro-
duction and decay parameters of 113Sn (115.09 d,
391.698 keV - 64.97 %) are satisfying the usual require-
ments (medium half-lives, intense gamma-lines) for ap-
plication in TLA. Recommended cross sections and spe-
ciﬁc activity as a function of depth up to 20 MeV can be
found in the IAEA TLA database for the natIn(p,x)113Sn
reaction. According to Fig. 15 the recommended data
are a little lower above 12 MeV and a little higher be-
low 12 MeV proton energy, than what was found in this
experiment. By studying the decay parameters of the re-
action products and their excitation functions it can be
concluded that the 113Sn can be used in TLA not only
in low energy irradiation but much more eﬀectively at
higher energy irradiations due to the signiﬁcantly higher
cross sections, i.e. shorter irradiation time. (Fig. 2). It
should also be mentioned that in this case the penetra-
tion depth will be much higher, which might not ﬁt to
every wear measurement task. It should be mentioned
additionally to 113Sn that the natIn(p,x)114mIn reaction
is also a good candidate for TLA labeling, due to the
shorter half-life, high cross sections and the proper de-
cay of 114mIn ( 49.51 d, 190.27 keV - 15.56 %). Accord-
ing to Fig. 6, however, unfortunately only one experi-
mental data set is available.

5. Summary and conclusions

The results might contribute to medical and indus-
trial applications as well as to development of theoret-
ical nuclear reaction codes. We discuss the usefulness
of proton induced reactions on indium for production
of 110Sn/110mIn, 111Sn/111gIn, 113Sn/113mIn, and 114mIn
in comparison with other production routes. Except
114mIn, where the product is carrier added, the advan-
tage for the production of other three products through
Sn/In generators is the high radionuclide purity and high
speciﬁc activity. Disadvantage of the generator method
in case of 111gIn is the short half-life of 111Sn (small
batch yields). The recently measured new experimental
data will also allow further development of the nuclear
database for thin layer activation, as well as make pos-
sible a further reﬁnement in the nuclear reaction model
codes.
