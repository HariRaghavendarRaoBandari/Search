Abstract

We discuss the X(5568) particle recently announced by the D0 Collaboration. Several
types of models were proposed to explain this structure in the literature. As pointed out
by Burns and Swanson (arXiv:1603.04366), none of them provides a satisfactory description
of the observation. We provide additional arguments using general properties of QCD, and
conclude that the observation of the X(5568), if conﬁrmed, poses serious challenges to our
understanding of nonperturbative QCD.

Introduction. Very recently, the D0 Collaboration reported the observation of a narrow peak
s π± invariant mass distribution based on data from p¯p collisions at √s = 1.96 TeV [1].
in the B0
They ﬁtted to the data using an S-wave (and a P -wave for studying systematic uncertainties)
Breit–Wigner parametrization, and obtained a mass and width of

ΓX(5568) = (cid:0)21.9 ± 6.4+5.0

with a signiﬁcance of 5.1 σ. This observation has triggered a lot of theoretical calculations and
speculations [1–18], most of which interpreted the signal as a resonance consisting of two quarks
and two antiquarks, i.e. ¯bsq ¯q (q = u, d), either of a compact tetraquark or meson-meson molecular
structure. There is also an explanation using the so-called triangle singularity [8] by observing
that the peak is located only about 13 MeV above the B∗
s π → Bsπ
rescattering is required. A warning message was delivered in Ref. [17], where the diﬃculties of
interpreting the signal as a tetraquark, a hadronic molecule or a threshold eﬀect were discussed.
In this short note, we want to sharpen the conclusions of Ref. [17] by using very general arguments
from quantum chromodynamics (QCD) which include chiral symmetry and heavy quark symmetry.
We will argue that if the X(5568) will be conﬁrmed with the reported properties, then it would
pose serious challenges to our understanding of nonperturbative QCD.

bosons which are identiﬁed as the lightest pseudoscalar multiplet. This explains why the pion
mass, Mπ ≃ 138 MeV, is much lighter than the mass of any other hadron. Chiral perturbation
theory (CHPT) [19, 20] is the low-energy eﬀective ﬁeld theory for QCD based on chiral symmetry
and its spontaneous breaking. At leading order, one has the Gell-Mann–Oakes–Renner relation
M 2
π = 2Bmq ∝ mq, with mq the light quark mass and B a positive constant. It is clear that the
pion mass vanishes in the chiral limit mq → 0. In CHPT, one counts Mπ = O (p) with p ≪ MR
being a small momentum scale where MR denotes the mass of the lowest resonance, which can
not be described in a perturbative expansion like CHPT. Any hadron other than the Goldstone

bosons has a nonvanishing mass in the chiral limit, and this mass is of order O(cid:0)p0(cid:1). This can be
generalized to argue that introducing any additional quark-antiquark (q ¯q) pair will add a mass of
δmq ¯q = O (MR) ≫ Mπ. The Bs is the ground state of ¯bs systems, and any excitation will increase
the mass. We thus expect that a ¯bs¯qq tetraquark to have a mass

M¯bs¯qq & MBs + MR.

(2)

If we estimate MR by the f0(500) meson mass, which is the lowest meson resonance, then we get
∼ 5.9 GeV. It is much above the observed mass of the X(5568), consistent with the expectation
in Ref. [17] from the point of view of constituent quark model. The only possibility evading such
a large mass is to generate a state from the interaction between bottom mesons and Goldstone
bosons, more precisely, pions. If the interaction between matter ﬁeld and pseudo-Goldstone boson
is strong, then it is possible to generate a state close to the threshold. Since the reported mass is
not far from the Bsπ threshold, we discuss only the S-wave case. However, the low-energy pionic
interaction is weak because of chiral symmetry. Furthermore, the leading order interactions in the
chiral expansion in both of the Bsπ and isovector B ¯K channels vanish, see, e.g., Ref. [21]. It is
possible to generate a pole from coupled-channel eﬀects. But then the pole should not be located
only 60 MeV above the Bsπ threshold. In fact, in the charmed sector, a pole can be generated
by the isovector coupled-channel Dsπ–DK dynamics [21], but it is deep in the complex energy
plane with a real part about 200 MeV higher than the Dsπ threshold.

Heavy quark symmetry. In the heavy quark limit, for any hadron containing a single heavy
quark, the heavy quark mass does not play a role in the dynamics (see, e.g., Ref. [22]). This
leads to heavy quark ﬂavor symmetry (HQFS). If the X(5568) is a hadron resonance, either being
a compact tetraquark or of meson-meson type, it should have a charmed partner. The HQFS
breaking eﬀects are proportional to (1/mc − 1/mb) [22]. We therefore expect the charmed partner
of the X(5568) to have a mass around

where ¯MBs = 5.403 GeV and ¯MDs = 2.076 GeV are the spin-averaged masses of the pseudoscalar
and vector heavy-strange mesons. Within this mass range, the only candidate is the D∗
s0(2317)
which was discovered by the BaBar Collaboration in the Dsπ invariant mass distribution [23] and
has a width of less than 3.8 MeV [24]. It is generally believed that the D∗
s0(2317) is an isospin scalar
(isoscalar) meson, and its decay into the Ds and pion is due to isospin breaking eﬀects, which has
been proposed [25–27] to be used to discriminate the hadronic molecular interpretation [28–33]
from other possibilities. The width of the X(5568) is about 20 MeV. The only allowed possible
strong decay modes are the Bsπ and B∗
s π, both of which are isovector. Therefore, were the
X(5568) a hadronic resonance, its isospin should be 1, and hence the D∗
s0(2317) cannot be its
charmed partner. One needs to answer the question why the charmed partner of the X(5568),
with a width ideal for observation, has not been observed in the same processes where the very
narrow D∗

s0(2317) was observed.

Could the X(5568) be due to B∗

s π threshold eﬀects? Liu and Li suggested to explain the
peak as a triangle singularity eﬀect observing that it is close to the B∗
s π threshold [8]. Their
model involves the rescattering from B∗
s π to Bsπ. This mechanism was questioned in Ref. [17]
as such a process is too weak as it is in a P -wave and no ﬂavor exchange is possible. Here we
will show to what extent such a rescattering is suppressed. Around the X(5568) peak, the pion

s π are low. Thus, we can describe such a process by an eﬀective
s spin multiplet by
s · ~σ + Bs [34], where ~σ are Pauli matrices, which transforms under parity (P)

momenta in both Bsπ and B∗
chiral Lagrangian respecting heavy quark symmetry. We denote the Bs and B∗
a superﬁeld Hs = ~B∗
and heavy quark spin (S) transformations as

where h,i denotes the trace in the spinor space and a is the light ﬂavor index. Here χ+ and ui are
the usual building blocks of chiral Lagrangians. They contain an even number and an odd number
of pion ﬁelds, respectively, and read χ+ = 2χ − {π,{π, χ}}/(4F 2) + . . . and ui = −∂iπ/F + . . .,
where χ = 2B · diag(mu, md), F is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit, and π is the usual
2 × 2 matrix for the pion isospin triplet. These operators are doubly suppressed: (1) the lowest
order possible operators in the chiral expansion, as given above, are of O(cid:0)p4(cid:1), the next-to-next-
to-next-to-leading order, in the chiral expansion for the interaction between Goldstone bosons and
matter ﬁelds, and thus highly suppressed; (2) the bottom-strange mesons and pions do not have
a common ﬂavor, and the interaction is thus OZI suppressed or 1/N 2
c suppressed (a relative 1/Nc
suppression in comparison with those scattering processes with a common quark ﬂavor), with Nc
the number of colors. These strong suppressions make less likely explaining the observed peak by
invoking B∗

Summary. To summarize, our arguments based on chiral symmetry and heavy quark symmetry
support the analysis in Ref. [17] that it is hard to explain the properties of the X(5568) using either
tetraquark, hadronic molecule, or threshold-eﬀect models. If the observation of the X(5568) is
conﬁrmed, it would have an important impact on the understanding of nonperturbative QCD. We
thus suggest to search for it in other processes such as the dipion decays of excited bottom-strange
mesons, e.g., B∗
s2(5840) → Bsππ, and search for its charmed partner using the huge data sets of
B factories. In fact, the LHCb Collaboration did not see a signal corresponding to the X(5568)
based on their pp collision data [35].
