We evidence critical ﬂuctuations in the strain-rate of granular ﬂows that are weakly vibrated.
Strikingly, the critical point arises at ﬁnite values of the mean strain rate and vibration strength,
far away from the yielding critical point at zero ﬂow rate. We show that the global rheology, as well
as the amplitude and correlation time of the ﬂuctuations, are consistent with a mean-ﬁeld, Landau
like description, where strain rate and stress act as conjugated variables. We introduce a general
model which captures the observed phenomenology, and argue that this type of critical behavior
generically arises when self ﬂuidization competes with friction.

Fluctuations play an essential role in ﬂows of disor-
dered media [1–17]. In the simplest scenario, such ﬂuc-
tuations are rate-independent, as in thermal systems or
strongly vibrated granular ﬂows [16–18]. New phenom-
ena, such as nonlocal rheology, arise when ﬂuctuations
are generated by the ﬂow itself, as observed for emul-
sions [5], foams [6], and granular matter [7–13]. Granu-
lar media are particularly susceptible to ﬂow-generated
and externally provided ﬂuctuations. First, the particles
are so hard that tiny motions cause large ﬂuctuations
in the contact forces [8, 19]. Second, sliding friction is
nearly rate independent, allowing subtle self-ﬂuidization
eﬀects to qualitatively modify the slope of the ﬂow curve,
e.g.
from neutral to negative [10, 20, 21]. Indeed, self-
ﬂuidization is particularly spectacular for granular me-
dia: for example, the ﬁnite yield threshold, a hallmark
of static granular media, completely vanishes in the pres-
ence of ﬂow anywhere in the granulate [9–13].

What is the precise role of ﬂuctuations for granular
ﬂows? Can local ﬂuctuations organize in strong and slow
collective ﬂuctuations? How can we model the mutual
coupling between ﬂuctuations and ﬂow?

To answer these questions, we probe the ﬂuctuations
and ﬂow of weakly vibrated granular media sheared in
a split-bottom cell [9, 10, 22]. First, by controlling the
driving torque T at ﬁnite shaking strength Γ, and mea-
suring the time-resolved global ﬂow rate S(t), we reveal
that ﬂuctuations in S become increasingly large and slow
when (T, Γ) → (Tc, Γ+
c ) (Fig. 1a-b). Second, we show
that rheological curves T (S), obtained at ﬁxed S, and
their variation as a function of Γ (Fig. 1c), can be cap-
tured in a mean-ﬁeld type expansion around (Tc, Γc). To-
gether, these experiments evidence the existence of a ﬁ-
nite ﬂow-rate (FFR) critical point. While strong ﬂuctu-
ations have been studied near the zero ﬂow-rate yielding
point [2], we stress that critical ﬂuctuations at FFR criti-
cal points have not been reported before, presumably be-

cause they remain hidden in absence of an external source
of vibrations. Finally, we introduce a general model that
combines a microscopic frictional rheology with ﬂuctua-
tions of the microscopic stresses. This model successfully
describes the experimentally observed Γ-dependent rhe-
ology and the emergence of the FFR critical point, natu-
rally capturing the intricate coupling between stress, ﬂow

rate, and ﬂuctuations. Our results suggest that the FFR
critical point is robust, and that similar critical behavior
may arise in other frictional or nearly rate-independent
systems, leading to potentially hazardous ﬂuctuations in
previously overlooked ﬂow regimes.

Setup and phenomenology: The vertically vibrated
split-bottom cell has been described in detail previously
[10, 14, 22, 23].
In this system we drive granular ﬂow
by rotation of a disk and probe the driving torque τ
and rotation rate Ω by a rheometer (Anton Paar DSR
301), which can be employed in rate or stress controlled
modes. We vertically vibrate the system as A sin(2πf t),
with f = 63 Hz, and control the dimensionless vibration
strength Γ = A(2πf )2/g, where g is the gravitational
acceleration. The rheometer and vibrating ﬂow cell are
coupled through a ﬂexure, and to accurately probe the
disk rotation we use an optical angular encoder (Heiden-
hain ERO 2500) directly coupled to the disk. We express
our results in dimensionless units T := τ /τy, where τy is
the dynamic yield torque in the absence of external vi-
brations, and S := log(I), where I is the inertial number
deﬁned for pressures and strain rates at half depth [24].
Critical Fluctuations: We ﬁrst perform experiments at
constant torque T and vibration amplitude Γ > Γc and
determine the magnitude and correlation time of the ﬂuc-
tuations in ﬂow rate via the instantaneous angular posi-
tion θ(t) of the bottom disk. We extract the rotation
rate ω(t) := ∂tθ(t), after carefully checking that θ(t) is
probed at suﬃciently high temporal resolution. We then
compute the averaged ﬂow rate Ω = hωi, the amplitude
of its ﬂuctuations σ2
lations R(τ ) = hδω(t + τ )δω(t)i /σ2
ω, where δω = ω − Ω
and h·i denote temporal averages. The correlation time
τc is extracted by ﬁtting the autocorrelation to an ex-
ponential (and is consistent with the time obtained by
integrating the correlation function).

ω = (cid:10)δω2(cid:11) and the temporal corre-

Fig. 2a-b display the resulting dimensionless ﬂuc-
tuation amplitude σω/Ω and dimensionless correlation
time τcΩ as a function of the relative torque T ∗(Γ) =
(T − Ti(Γ)) /Ti(Γ), where Ti(Γ) is the inﬂection point in
the ﬂow curves, for diﬀerent values of Γ > Γc. There
is a sharp contrast between the ﬂuctuations at either
side of the peaks, which we interpret as signaling two
qualitatively diﬀerent ﬂow regimes: a vibration dom-
inated creep regime (strong but short-time correlated
ﬂuctuations) and a fast inertial ﬂow regime (small ﬂuc-
tuations with time scale ≈ Ω−1). Crucially, there is a
sharp transition between these regimes: both the ﬂuctu-
ation amplitude σω/Ω and correlation time τcΩ exhibit
a sharp maximum at T ∗ ≃ 0, which rapidly grows when
Γ∗ = (Γ − Γc)/Γc → 0+.

To check the robustness of our measurements, we have
also determined the ﬂuctuation magnitude and correla-
tion by considering the rotating disk as a massive random
walker with drift. We thus characterize the mean square

angular displacement ∆θ(τ )2 = (cid:10)(θ(t + τ ) − θ(t))2(cid:11).

The amplitude of the ﬂow rate ﬂuctuations ˜σω and the
correlation time ˜τc are then extracted from the asymp-
totics: for τ /˜τc << 1, we observe ballistic dynamics with
∆θ(τ )2 ∼ ˜σ2
ωτ , while for τ /˜τc >> 1 the dynamics is dif-
fusive, with ∆θ(τ )2 ∼ 2˜σ2
ωτcτ . These two independent
protocols yield consistent results, as shown in the insets
of Fig. 2ab.

The peak in the ﬂow rate ﬂuctuations diverges in a
manner consistent with a power-law scaling ∼ Γ∗−˜γ, with
˜γ ≈ 0.5 (Fig. 2c). The correlation times are too noisy
to be reliably ﬁtted to a power law Γ∗−µ, but if any,
µ ∈ [0.5, 1] (Fig. 2d). Together, these signals provide
strong evidence for critical behavior.

Scaling of the ﬂow curves: The critical behavior re-
ported above suggest that the torque and ﬂow rate should
be related via a Landau type expansion in the critical
regime:

T = a(S − Si)3 + b(S − Si) + Ti ,

(1)

where (Ti(Γ), Si(Γ)) are the inﬂection points of the ﬂow
curves. In order to probe this relation, we perform rate
controlled experiments, in which we can also access the
negative slope regime. The ﬂow curves, shown in Fig. 1c,
are indeed reminiscent of a third order polynomial. Fit-
ting the data accordingly, we extract (Si, Ti), a and b, and
the local maximum (S ′
−) as
a function of Γ. As shown in Fig. 3a, the ﬂow curves can
be rescaled on two distinct branches, below and above
Γc, over a substantial range. As expected, the cubic co-
eﬃcient a remains essentially constant (a ≃ 2, not shown
here). The coeﬃcient b, which sets the slope at the inﬂec-
tion point, akin to an inverse susceptibility χ−1, crosses
zero at Γ = Γc and increases linearly with Γ∗. The lo-

planes, displayed on Figs 3c-d, together with the location
of the inﬂection point (Si, Ti), determine the so-called
spinodal lines, which are the stability limits of the fast
and slow ﬂow phases. The region of ”coexistence” corre-
sponds here to the set of parameters for which the ﬂow
curves have a negative slope. The width of this region
∆ = S+ − S− scales like |Γ∗|β, with β = 0.5 for Γ∗ < 0,
in agreement with Eq. (1) and the linear dependence of
b with Γ∗.

FFR Critical Point: Our data for both stress-
controlled and strain-rate controlled experiments provide
strong evidence for the existence of a critical point at ﬁ-
nite ﬂow rate, characterized by the following scaling re-
lations:

∆ ∼ Γ∗β;
χ ∼ Γ∗−γ;
σω/Ω ∼ Γ∗−˜γ;

β ≃ 0.5

We note that in stress control experiments, Γc = 0.65 ±
0.01, as determined from both the zero slope inﬂection
point of the ﬂow curves, and the diverging ﬂuctuations,
while in strain rate controlled experiments, Γc = 0.46 ±
0.01, as determined from the zero slope inﬂection point
of the ﬂow curves. We believe this diﬀerence to be due to
the complex combination of large intrinsic ﬂuctuations,
ﬁnite size eﬀects, and the non-perfect feedback loop of
the rheometer in rate controlled experiments.

The fact that the critical behavior of χ, obtained for
averaged quantities in strain rate controlled experiments,
and that of σ2
ω, obtained from the ﬂuctuations in stress
controlled experiments, coincide is a strong indication of
the relevance of our analysis. Both the value of the expo-
nents and the quality of the description of the ﬂow curves

3

by Eq. (1) suggest that a mean ﬁeld description should
capture the essence of the observed phenomenology.

Flow Model: We ﬁnally introduce a general ﬂuctuation-
frictional (FF) model that captures the observed rheol-
ogy. We combine a frictional local rheology with ﬂuc-
tuations that are induced by both vibrations and ﬂow,
and show that the average rheology of this model ex-
hibits all the experimentally observed hallmarks, includ-
ing the FFR critical point. First, we introduce an agita-
tion strength A, which is a function of both ﬂow-induced
and vibration-induced agitations [25]:

A = Ag(Γ, I) ,

(6)

where Ag = 0 only when both Γ and I are zero. Second,
we postulate that the local stresses Tm are ﬂuctuating
around their mean T , and that the microscopic stress
distribution P (Tm) = ¯P ((Tm − T )/A), where ¯P (x) is a
given normalized distribution centered at x = 0 — note
that A sets the width of P (Tm). Third, we determine
the global ﬂow rate I as the mean of the microscopic
ﬂow rates Im, where Im and Tm are related by simple
frictional Herschel-Bulkley rheology with a ﬁnite yield
stress — in particular, Im = 0 when |Tm| < 1. Combin-
ing these ingredients, we ﬁnd:

I(A, T ) =Z ∞

−∞

dTm
A

¯P (cid:18) Tm − T

A (cid:19) Im(Tm) .

(7)

For a prescribed set of functions Ag, P and Im(Tm),
Eqs. 6-7 completely set the ﬂow curves T (I, Γ). We start
with a deﬁnite choice of Ag, ¯P and Im [26] and then show
that our conclusions are insensitive to this choice - details
are provided in the Supp. Mat. [27].

The FF model exhibits the experimentally observed
singularity of the stress T (I, A) at the origin: when
A = 0, Eq. (7) implies that Tm = T , Im = I, so that the
macro rheology is identical to the microscopic rheology
and T (0+, 0) = 1. In contrast, when A > 0 but I = 0,
Eq. (7) implies that the stress distribution must be sym-
metric around zero — therefore T = 0, and in particular
T (0, 0+) = 0. The model thus captures the discontinuous
vanishing of the yield stress when Γ becomes ﬁnite.

We now show that the FF model captures all quali-
tative features of the rheology of weakly vibrated ﬂows.
The solutions to this model can be understood by consid-
ering the variation of Γ and T in the (I, A)-plane (Fig. 4).
The ﬂow curves T (I, Γ) can be determined graphically
via the intersections of the contour curves of T and Γ, by
ﬁxing Γ, varying T , and determining the corresponding
value(s) of I. For T > 1 there is only one intersection,
corresponding to rapid ﬂows, and in the remainder we
focus on T ≤ 1. (i) For large Γ, there is only one intersec-
tion (black dot), leading to monotonic ﬂow curves T (I).
(ii) For small Γ, there are three intersections (crosses),
corresponding to non monotonic ﬂow curves. (iii) In be-
tween these two regimes is the critical Γc curve (red), for

4

sentially mean ﬁeld. An alternative, more complete strat-
egy would be to write down a dynamical equation for
the microscopic stress distribution, as introduced in the
H´ebraud-Lequeux [1] and related ﬂuidity models [28, 29],
which at present do not capture the critical scaling of the
ﬂow curves nor the diverging ﬂuctuations. In these mod-
els the self-ﬂuidization is captured by a diﬀusion term
for the local stresses, the amplitude of which is linearly
related to the amount of stress exceeding the local yield
stress. Adding any ﬁnite amount of external noise via a
constant term in the diﬀusion amplitude, we expect the
dynamical yield stress to vanish as observed here. Then,
following [29], one could work out the relation between
model parameters and ﬂow rate, and hopefully obtain
the observed non-monotonic rheology. Stress ﬂuctuations
could also be taken into account following the very re-
cent work by Agoritsas et al. [30]. It is an open question
whether such models can exhibit a negative slope at zero
ﬂow rate in the absence of external vibrations.

which the three intersection points merge (red dot). (iv)
Finally, for Γ = 0, there are precisely two intersections,
corresponding to the only ﬂow curve that has ﬁnite T
and negative slope at I = 0. We stress that the scenario
that emerges captures the essence of the experimental
ﬂow curves shown in Fig. 1a, without having to make
any assumptions about the behavior of A near the FFR
critical point.

Clearly, the essence of this scenario does not depend
on the details of the agitation function Ag, distribution
¯P and local rheology Tm. The only condition is that the
Γ = 0 curve is steeper than the T = 1 contour at the
origin, such that there are two intersections between the
Γ = 0 and T = 1 curves — for other examples of ﬂow
curves, including for when this condition is violated, see
the Supp. Mat. [27].

Discussion: We have uncovered a dynamical critical
point in agitated frictional ﬂows. We stress again that the
concomitant large ﬂuctuations arise at ﬁnite ﬂow rates,
away from the yielding point where strong ﬂuctuations
have been seen before [2], which makes this an experimen-
tally easily accessible yet nontrivial critical point which
deserves further investigation. We argued that this crit-
icality emerges from the interplay of external vibration
and self-ﬂuidization. Both act as sources of agitation, but
inﬂuence the rheology very diﬀerently: while external ag-
itations set the yield stress to zero and impose a positive
slope in the limit of zero ﬂow rate, ﬂow induced ﬂuctu-
ations cause a negative slope in the ﬂow curves, at least
in the absence of externally provided ﬂuctuations. The
FFR critical behavior emerges due to the competition of
these.

From a more theoretical point of view, the model we
have introduced here is purely phenomenological and es-

[23] Split-bottom ﬂow geometries produce smooth, robust,
and well controlled granular ﬂows. Our cell consists of
an acrylic cylindrical container (inner radius 7.0 cm), at
the bottom of which a rotating disk of radius rs of 4 cm
drives the ﬂow. To ensure no-slip boundary conditions,
the top surface of the disk and cylinder bottom is made
rough. The cell is ﬁlled to a height H of 24 mm with black
soda-lime glass beads with diameters ranging from 1 to
1.3 mm. All experiments are carried out under ambient
temperature, pressure and relative humidity, and our ex-
periments reproduce well over the course of several years
— more details in [10, 14].

[24] We use the standard deﬁnition of I := ˙γd/pP/ρ [3],
which, based on our estimates of typical values of
˙γ
throughout the ﬂowing zone amounts to I = (0.3s)Ω [22].
[25] We use I rather than S in the model, as we want to

consider the absence of ﬂow at I = 0.

tures that both vibrations and ﬂow induce ﬂuctua-

Supplemental Material
Here we provide a detailed discussion of the FF model
that relates ﬂuctuations, ﬂow and stress. The aim of
this model is to explore how the main experimental ﬁnd-
ings for slow, i.e., non-inertial, weakly vibrated granular
ﬂows can be captured by introducing a scalar agitation
strength A. We note that the experimentally observed
increase of T (I) for large values of I is due to inertial
eﬀects that our model does not necessarily capture.

The central idea of the FF model is illustrated in Fig. 5.
We assume that in the presence of agitations of magni-
tude A, a macroscopically applied stress T leads to a
distribution of microscopic stresses P (Tm). We assume
P (Tm) to be symmetric, peaked around Tm = T , and
with a width proportional to A — in the limit of vanish-
ing agitation strength, P (Tm) approaches a δ-function
(Fig. 5). For deﬁniteness, we assume here that P has
exponential tails, although this is not essential for our
qualitative picture:

P (Tm) = (2A)−1 exp(−|(Tm − T )|/A) .

(8)

We furthermore assume that a local rheology relates
a distribution of ﬂow rates Im to P (Tm), and that the
global ﬂow rate I is the mean of Im:

I(A, T ) =Z ∞

−∞

dTm P (Tm) Im(Tm) .

(9)

For the local rheology we take a Herschel-Bulkley form
with unit yield stress, i.e.,

Tm = sign(Im) [1 + |Im|α] ,

(10)

where for simplicity we set α = 1. This captures the
essential feature of a microscopic ﬂow threshold, as Im =
0 in the jammed region |Tm| < 1.

An important consequence of Eq. (8-10) is the singu-
lar diﬀerence in global ﬂow rheology between A = 0 and
A 6= 0. When A = 0, the global ﬂow follows the local
rheology, and there only will be ﬂow when |T | > 1. How-
ever, when A 6= 0, P (Tm) has a ﬁnite weight outside the
jammed region, and I will be ﬁnite for any value of T ,
unequal to zero. In other words, limA→0(limI→0 T ) = 0
limI→0(limA→0 T ) = 1.

What sets the agitation strength? Clearly, A = 0 when
both Γ and I are zero, and A should be non-zero when ei-
ther I or Γ are ﬁnite. This strongly suggests that Ag(Γ, I)
is linear in both Γ and I for small values of these argu-
ments. Below, we show the results for two functional
forms of A. The simplest linear agitation function reads:

Ag(Γ, I) = κΓ + λI ,

(11)

where we can set κ = 1 by overall scaling of A, and
where we will show λ to be an important parameter. In
the main text, we have taken a slightly more complex
form for Ag(I, Γ):

Ag(Γ, I) = Γ + (1 − exp(I/I0)), with I0 = 0.25 ,

(12)

where the exponential form is motivated by the observa-
tion that the ﬂow-induced ﬂuctuations likely saturate at
large ﬂow rates.

Qualitative Properties: Even without solving the cou-
pled equations (8-12), most qualitative properties of their
solutions can be shown in a straightforward manner to
match our experimental ﬁndings. The ﬁrst two prop-
erties follow from the singular diﬀerence in global ﬂow
rheology between A = 0 and A 6= 0 discussed above, and
capture the singular vanishing of the yield stress when Γ
becomes ﬁnite:
(1) When Γ 6= 0 and T 6= 0, there is ﬂow.

the ﬂowcurve T (I) has a positive slope for small I.

The slope of the ﬂow curve for Γ = 0 requires a more
subtle analysis, involving the rheological curves. These
rheological curves T (I) for ﬁxed Γ can be obtained graph-
ically, by considering both T and Γ as a function of I
and A. To do so, we ﬁx T and vary A to obtain I using
Eq. (9), which yields contours of ﬁxed T , and use Eq. (11)
or (12) to plot A(Γ, I) at ﬁxed Γ yielding Γ-contours. In
Fig. 6a we show these curves, for the agitation function
given by Eq. (12). Fixing Γ, the rheology, i.e. I(T ) fol-
lows from intersections of the pertaining Γ-contours and
T -contours, where we note that there may be multiple
solutions. Fig. 6b-c schematically illustrate that it is the
relative slope of the Γ-contours and T -contours which de-
termines whether the ﬂow curve T (I) has a positive or
negative slope.

In particular, the question whether the ﬂow curve for
Γ = 0 has a negative slope for small I, can be answered by
inspecting the slopes of the Γ = 0 curve and the T = 1
curve which meet at the origin (Fig. 6a). Expanding
Eq. 9 for small A yields that A ≈ 2I along the T = 1
contour. Hence, as long as ∂AI|I = 0 > 2 (evaluated
along the Γ = 0 contour), the Γ = 0 ﬂow curve will have
a negative slope. This is manifestly true for the agitation
function given by Eq. (12), and is also true for the agita-
tion function given by Eq. (11), provided that λ > 2. In
Figs. 7 and 8 we show examples of the contourplots and
corresponding rheological curves for λ = 3 and λ = 1.5.
The former clearly exhibits a Γ = 0 ﬂow curve with nega-
tive slope, and corresponding FFR critical point: details
of the agitation function are not important for the over-
all scenario. However, when λ is too low, the scenario
changes qualitatively: even though the origin is still sin-
gular, there is no longer a ﬁnite yield stress for Γ = 0, no
negative slope, and no FFR critical point (Figs. 8).

model, for a linear agitation function Ag(Γ, I) = Γ + 1.5 × I.

(2) When Γ = 0, the system is jammed for |T | < 1.
A corollary of the ﬁrst property is that when Γ 6= 0, the
stress smoothly goes to zero when I → 0, implying that
