The evolution equation for inhomogeneous and anisotropic temperature
ﬂuctuations inside a medium is derived within the ambit of Boltzmann
Transport Equation. Also, taking some existing realistic inputs we have
analyzed the Fourier space variation of temperature ﬂuctuation for the
medium created after heavy-ion collisions. The eﬀect of viscosity on the
variation of ﬂuctuations is investigated. Further, possible implications in
hadronic and heavy-ion collisions are explored.

1. Introduction

Fluctuations are commonly discussed for wide range of systems leading
to various diﬀerent phenomena. Density ﬂuctuations at all length scales
in the second order phase transition, the event-by-event ﬂuctuation of con-
served numbers in heavy ion collisions, important to explore the phase dia-
gram of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), are some such examples. Much
in the same way as number of particles in a certain region of a system ﬂuc-
tuates, the everyday examples teach us that the temperature for physical
systems can also ﬂuctuate. The dynamics of the evolving system dictates the
temperature ﬂuctuation until the system comes to equilibrium and therefore
it may vary with time and space during evolution.

Figure 1 shows a system with radially varying temperature zones. We
model the system to consist of several non-interacting zones whose tem-
peratures remain constant within a pre-determined time scale. But, after
that given time the temperatures vary. So, the average value as well as the
temperature ﬂuctuation are the quantities which vary with time.

Fig. 1: Radially varying temperature proﬁle in a medium [1].

In the present work, the evolution of ﬂuctuation in inverse temperature
(β = 1/T ) is discussed for a system resembling with the system formed in
heavy ion collisions using Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) in Relax-
ation Time Approximation (RTA). It is assumed that the observation time
is much less than the relaxation time of the thermal bath. Further, we
extend this study for an arbitrary observation time.

2. Method

In order to study the evolution of temperature ﬂuctuation, we consider

the following ansatz for the particle distribution function:

f = e−βp(1+∆β).

(1)

Here, we consider a medium with Boltzmann distribution of massless par-
ticles with average inverse temperature β(t), at some time slice. To include
anisotropic and inhomogeneous ﬂuctuation we add a function ∆β(~r, ˆp; t),
where ˆp is an unit vector along the direction of motion of particle. We use
the BTE to calculate the temporal evolution of β. Following is the generic
form of BTE:

df
dt

+ ~v.~∇f + ~F .~∇pf = C[f ].

(2)

=

∂f
∂t

Here ~v is particle velocity, ~F is any external force, C[f ] is the collision
term to take care the interaction and ~∇p is the momentum-space gradient
operator. For present study, we assume that the system experiences no
external force, and hence ~F = 0. However, the inhomogeneity in ∆β still
exists.

By assuming an isotropic ﬂuctuation proﬁle and averaging over the whole
solid angle Ω subtended by ˆp the average ﬂuctuations are derived as follows:

here ~k is a constant vector directed along the z-axis. Fig. 2 shows the
parametric Fourier space variation of the ∆βrel(~k; t) with time (t − t0) and
relaxation time (tR) respectively. It is observed that the relative ﬂuctua-
tions die down with time. Additionally, the ﬂuctuations at larger distances
towards the periphery of the medium, are large. Further, we observe no
modiﬁcation of ﬂuctuation with increasing tR when (t − t0) << tR.

To study a more realistic situation, we consider the temperature proﬁles
[1] of a evolving medium at diﬀerent stages of the evolution of Quark-Gluon
Plasma [2] created in central collisions. Given the proﬁle, we get a set of
temperatures, their average value and the temperature ﬂuctuation on top of
the average value. We can ﬁnd out the variation of the inverse temperature
ﬂuctuation at diﬀerent stages (for more details see [1]).

3. Results and Discussions

Fig. 3(a), shows that the soft modes of β-ﬂuctuation become dominant
at large system radius and Fig. 3(b) shows the variation of ﬂuctuation for
diﬀerent viscosities of the medium. As intuitively expected, higher viscosity
favours lower ﬂuctuations. Within any arbitrary choice of radius shell the
relative ﬂuctuations die down with time. For demonstration, we have chosen
the shell ranging between the radii 14 fm to 15 fm. But our observation
remains unaltered for any other shell.

In view of the connection between the relative temperature ﬂuctuation
and the Tsallis q parameter, as shown in Ref.
[3], we can compute the
relative temperature ﬂuctuation in QGP produced in a single event existing
even after a long time. The relative temperature ﬂuctuation at the boundary
is seen to be close to the experimentally obtained value 0.018 ± 0.005 for
0-10% central HICs at RHIC with √sNN = 200 GeV [4].
