In single molecule magnets, the exchange between a localized spin moment and the electronic background
provides a suitable laboratory for studies of dynamical aspects of both the local spin and transport properties.
Here we address the time-evolution of a localized spin moment coupled to an electronic level in a molecular
quantum dot embedded in a tunnel junction between metallic leads. The interactions between the localized
spin moment and the electronic level generates an effective interaction between the spin moment at different
instances in time. Therefore, we show that, despite being a single spin system, there are effective contributions
of isotropic Heisenberg, and anisotropic Ising and Dzyaloshinski-Moriya character acting on the spin moment.
The interactions can be controlled by gate voltage, voltage bias, the spin-polarization in the leads, in addition to
external magnetic ﬁelds. Signatures of the spin dynamics are found in the transport properties of the tunneling
system and we demonstrate that measurements of the spin-current may be used for read-out of the local spin
moment orientation.

INTRODUCTION

Single molecule magnets provide interesting workbench
opportunities to study quantum phenomena related to their in-
dividual properties as well as promising potential for quantum
information technology and quantum computation based on
spintronics devices. Easy control of single magnetic moments
open for deepened exploration of, e.g., magnetic anisotropies
and exchange interaction, as well as new routes for signiﬁ-
cantly less energy consuming active electronics devices and
information storage.

Molecular magnets offer a platform for studies of mag-
netic properties on a fundamental level due to their intrin-
sic discreteness. Experimentally this has opened for elec-
tronic control and detection of the magnetization of individual
molecules [1–3], magnetic anisotropy and exchange interac-
tion of single atoms such, e.g., Co and Mn on a surface [4–
8] and tuning of the magnetic anisotropy in molecular mag-
nets [9]. Furthermore, spatial anisotropies have been observed
for the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction
[10] as well as signatures of superexchange interaction and
long-range Kondo effect between single magnetic molecules
[11–13]. These advanced in the experimental techniques have
led to realizations of magnetically stable atomic scale conﬁg-
urations [14–16] which are important steps that lead way to
stable magnetic memory devices at the atomic scale. Mag-
netic molecules containing transition metal atoms, e.g., M-
phthalocyanine and M-porphyrins where M denotes a transi-
tion metal element (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) [17–21], as well
as single molecules comprising complexes of transition metal
elements [22, 23] and antiferromagnetic rings [24–29] have
been explored in many different contexts.

For technological applications, on the other hand, molec-
ular magnets and magnetic materials the potential is literally
unlimited. A range of different spintronics devices have been

proposed, both using spin currents [30] or spin torque [31],
including devices such as molecular spin-transistor, molecu-
lar spin-valve, molecular multidot devices [32]. These can
potentially be used both as building blocks of quantum com-
puters [33] and as quantum simulators [34]. There are already
several experimental realizations of these kind of devices in-
cluding magnetic memories and spin qubits [35–38].

On the theoretical side, we have witnessed a great progress
during the course of the past decade in developments of the
theory for, e.g., single molecular magnets and magnetization
dynamics. There have been several studies of magnetic ex-
change interaction and the possibilities for electrical control
of the interaction and spin transport [39–44]. Under non-
equilibrium conditions, magnetic molecules show signatures
of intrinsic anisotropic exchange interactions that can be used
for control of the molecular spin [41, 45], something which
may lead to read-and-write capabilities with currents in spin-
tronics devices [46, 47]. Non-equilibrium studies of transport
properties have, moreover, suggested that vibrations coupled
to the spin degrees of freedom may induce electrical currents
which can provide interesting properties for, e.g., mechanical
control of single magnetic molecules [48, 49]. Superconduct-
ing spintronics also open routes to enhance central effects in
spintronics devices [50–53].

The majority of the reported theoretical progress is, how-
ever, restricted to stationary, or Markovian, processes. Al-
though this is an important regime, both for fundamental stud-
ies as well as for technological applications, it is nonethe-
less crucial to control also transient properties induced by
sudden on-sets and variation of the external conditions ap-
plied to the system. Regarding spin dynamics, the Landau-
Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation is often postulated as the plat-
form for theoretical studies, despite that the (exchange and
damping) parameters for this equation typically are taken on
phenomenological grounds or from experiments. These pa-
rameters are, in addition, assumed to have a negligible time-
dependence, something which cannot be taken for granted in
nanoscale systems. Previous derivations of the LLG equa-
tion [39, 54] clearly illustrate that the electronically mediated

are no ad hoc contributions in the description in addition to
the basic model. However, within the realms of the model,
there is a current mediated spin-spin interaction generated in
the effective spin model, which describes interactions between
the spin at time t and time t(cid:48). Hence, although there is only one
spin in the system, it is still justiﬁed to introduce the concept
of spin-spin interaction since the spin at different times can be
regarded as different spins.

Separation of the magnetic molecule into a QD level
and a localized magnetic moment is justiﬁed for, e.g., M-
phthalocyanines and M-porphyrins. In these compounds, the
transition metal d-levels, which are deeply localized, consti-
tute the localized magnetic moment. The s- and p-orbitals in
the ligands, on the other hand, generate the spectral intensity
at the HOMO and LUMO levels which may be considered as
the QD level(s) in our model.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we discuss the
basic set-up of the formalism we employ in this study. After
deﬁning the model for the magnetic molecular QD, we derive
the equations for the spin moment and the tunneling current.
Numerical results from these equations are presented in Sec.
III and we summarize and conclude the paper in Sec. IV.

II. METHOD

To be speciﬁc, we consider a magnetic molecule embedded
in a tunnel junction between metallic leads which may support
spin-polarized currents, see Fig. 1 for reference. The mag-
netic molecule comprise a localized magnetic moment S cou-
pled via exchange to the molecular HOMO or LUMO level,
henceforth referred to as the QD level. We deﬁne our system
Hamiltonian as

H = Hχ + HT + HQD + HS.

(1)

Here, Hχ = ∑k∈χ,σ (εkχσ − µχ )c†
kχσ ckχσ is the Hamiltonian
for the lead χ = L/R, where c†
kχσ (ckχσ ) creates (annihi-
lates) an electron in the lead with energy εkχσ , momentum
k and spin σ =↑,↓. We have introduced the chemical poten-
tial µχ for the leads and the voltage bias across the junction
deﬁned as V = µL − µR. Tunneling between the leads and the
QD level is described by HT = HT L + HT R, where HT χ =
Tχ ∑kσ∈χ c†
kχσ dσ + H.c.. The single level QD is represented
by HQD = ∑σ εσ d†
σ (dσ ) creates (annihilates)
an electron in the QD with energy εσ = ε0 + gµBBσ z
σσ /2 and
spin σ. We include the Zeeman split due to the external mag-
netic ﬁeld B = Bˆz where g is the gyromagnetic ratio and µB
the Bohr magneton. The local spin is described by HS =
−gµBS · B − vs · S, where v is the interacting rate between
the local spin and the electron spin s = ∑σσ(cid:48) d†
σ σσσ(cid:48)dσ(cid:48)/2,
whereas σσσ(cid:48) is the vector of Pauli matrices.

A. Equation of motion of the local magnetic moment

Using the methods in, e.g., Refs. [39, 42, 44, 54, 55], we
derive an effective spin model for the localized magnetic mo-

and non-magnetic leads.

exchange interactions strongly depend on the magnetization
dynamics and are, hence, intrinsically dynamical quantities as
well. The non-linearity of the dynamical equations indicates,
moreover, that it is non-trivial to decide whenever the time-
dependence of the interaction parameters can be neglected.

In order to begin to depart from the ad hoc treatments of
dynamics of spins coupled to electron currents, in this paper
we perform time-dependent studies and analyses beyond the
Markovian and adiabatic approximations for both the spin-
dynamics and the tunneling current. In addition, we include
the interdependence between the current through the molecule
and the localized magnetic moment by considering both ac-
tion and back-action in the description. This can be regarded
as the ﬁrst loop in a self-consistent calculation, however, we
do not perform our calculations to full self-consistency.

The model system, onto which we apply our developed
method, comprises a magnetic molecule which is embedded
in the tunnel junction between metallic leads. The leads them-
selves may support spin-polarized currents. Here, the mag-
netic molecule consists of two components, namely, a quan-
tum dot (QD) level and a localized magnetic moment which
interact via exchange. The QD level is tunnel coupled to the
leads. Hence, the current ﬂowing through the metal-QD-metal
complex is expected to probe the presence of the localized
magnetic moment and, vice versa, the localized magnetic mo-
ment is expected to depend on the current. Taking this ob-
servation as an initial condition for our studies, we construct
a calculation scheme in which the dynamics of the localized
magnetic moment is described by a generalized version of the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation [39, 42, 54, 55]. The effec-
tive spin-spin interactions are mediated by the tunneling cur-
rent ﬂowing across the junction. The current, on the other
hand, depends directly on the presence and dynamics of the
localized magnetic moment. We include this dependence by
feeding the time-evolution of the spin dynamics into the cur-
rent, which leads to that the current dependent temporal spin
ﬂuctuations generate signatures back into the current.

The effective spin model derived in Sec. II, depends only
on the parameters included in our microscopical model – there

tions between the localized magnetic moment at times t and t(cid:48).

This current mediated interaction can be decomposed into
an isotropic Heisenberg, JH, interaction and the anisotropic
Dzyaloshinski-Moriya (DM), D, and Ising, I, interactions.
This can be seen from the product S· J· S, which is the cor-
responding contribution in the effective spin model [44] to
S(t)× J(t,t(cid:48))· S(t(cid:48)) in the spin equation of motion. Using the
general partitioning G = G0σ 0 +G1· σ, where G0 and G1 de-
scribes the electronic charge and spin, it is straight forward to
see that

This leads to that we can partition the current mediated spin-
spin interaction in the spin equation of motion into

S(t)× J(t,t(cid:48))· S(t(cid:48)) =JH (t,t(cid:48))S(t)× S(t(cid:48))

+ S(t)× I(t,t(cid:48))· S(t(cid:48))
− S(t)× D(t,t(cid:48))× S(t(cid:48)).

(10)

In absence of spin-dependence in the QD GF, that is, for
G1 = 0, it is clear that only the Heisenberg interaction JH re-
mains, since both I and D explicitly depend on G1. There are
different sources that generates a ﬁnite G1, e.g., spin injection
from the leads, Zeeman split QD level, but also the interac-
tion with the localized magnetic moment gives an essential
contribution. In this paper, we include effects from all three
sources.

B. Quantum dot GF

1. Bare quantum dot Green function

Next, we derive the GF for the QD, which is deﬁned as
G(t,t(cid:48)) = {(−i)(cid:104)Tc†
σ(cid:48)(t(cid:48))cσ (t)(cid:105)}σσ(cid:48) where T is the contour-
ordering operator. We introduce a bare GF gσ (t,t(cid:48)) as the so-
lution to the equation
(i∂t − εσ )gσ (t,t(cid:48)) =δ (t −t(cid:48)) +

Σσ (t,τ)gσ (τ,t(cid:48))dτ.

2. Dressed quantum dot Green function

The next step is to include the interactions with the local
magnetic moment into the description. We achieve this goal
by deﬁning the dressed QD GF as the ﬁrst order expansion in
terms of the local moment, that is,

where g is the bare GF and δG is the correction from the
interactions with the local magnetic moment. Similarly as
above, we write G = G0σ 0 + σ · G1, where G0 = g0 + δ G0
and G1 = g1 + δG1, whereas the corrections are given by

δ G0(t,t(cid:48)) =− v

We refer to the Appendix for details about the lesser/greater
forms of the charge and magnetic components of δG.

It should be noticed that the presence of the local spin mo-
ment gives rise to a spin-polarization of the QD level due
to the local exchange interaction, see Fig. 2 (b) for an il-
lustration. The effect is particularly strong whenever there
is an intrinsic spin-polarization in either the leads and/or the

These expressions for the charge and spin currents suggest
that any local dynamics that is picked up by the electronic
structure of the QD should provide signatures in its transport
properties. Next, we analyze the impact of the local dynamics
on the transport properties.

III. RESULTS

A. Stationary limit

Before embarking into the full time-dependent properties
of the system, we review some of the expected results for the
stationary regime in order to provide a benchmark for our cal-
culations. In the stationary limit all the time-dependences in-
duced from the on-set of the applied voltage bias have decayed
which leads to that the bare QD GF becomes time local and we
can, therefore, study the energetic properties of the QD. Then,
the local magnetic moment, (cid:104)S(cid:105), can be regarded as a constant
spin-polarization and a source for coupling between the spin
states, in agreement with Ref. [43]. The Fourier transform of
the bare QD GF is, therefore, written on the form

(29b)

QD, in which case g1 (cid:54)= 0. Then, the local spin moment af-
fects the properties of both the charge and magnetic structure
of the QD. Nevertheless, even for spin-degenerate leads and
QD, that is, for g1 ≡ 0, the QD level acquires a ﬁnite spin-
dependence. This is legible in the expression for δG1, where
the ﬁrst term only depends on the magnetic properties of the
local spin moment and the charge density in the QD. Thus,
by calculating the electronic structure in the QD as function
of the local spin moment opens for tracing signatures of the
local spin dynamics in the properties of the QD.

C. Current

The properties of the QD is probed by means of the electron
currents ﬂowing through the system. In this way, the goal is to
pick up signatures of the spin dynamics in the transport prop-
erties as these should inﬂuence the electronic structure of the
QD. The electron currents can be decomposed into charge and
spin currents, IC and IS, respectively. Here, we calculate the
currents ﬂowing through the left interface between the leads
and the QD. Accordingly, we deﬁne

and VR = −V /2.

FIG. 5: Ising interaction I of a static local magnetic moment in a

interaction for non-magnetic leads pχ = 0 as a function of bias volt-
age V. Here, the gate voltage is set to ε0 = 0 meV and ε0 = 1 meV
and the plots shifted for clarity (scale is the same). Panel (b) shows
the Ising interaction for antiferromagnetic leads, pL = −pR = 0.5, as
a function of bias voltage V. Other parameters as in Fig. 3.

Considering a symmetric and spin-independent back-
ground, i.e. non-magnetic contacts pχ = 0, and a constant
local magnetic moment, S, the local spin-polarization gives
rise to ﬁnite spin currents IS in the system, see Eqs. (25) –
(26) (note ΓS = 0). In Fig. 3 we plot the calculated (a) charge
(IC) and (b) spin current (IS) as function of the gate voltage,

the features in the spin current for gate voltages near zero
gives a clear indication of the induced spin-polarization from
the local spin moment. Due to the local spin moment induced
effective Zeeman split in the QD, as shown in Fig. 2 (b), the
spin current is strongly peaked at µχ = ε0. As can be seen in
Fig. 2, either one of the spin up- or down channels will be
more favorable for the tunneling electrons, thus causing a net
spin current in either direction depending on the conﬁguration
of the electron level of the leads. This is an important feature
as it can be used in order to read out the state of the local spin
moment from the spin current.

Regarding the Heisenberg interaction, recalling that, e.g.,
0(ω) = 1/(ω −ε0 +iΓ0/4) for non-magnetic leads,
Gr
0(ω) = gr
it can be readily seen that the charge contribution to the
Heisenberg exchange is given by

This suggests a spin-spin interaction which is strongly peaked

which is also strongly peaked at µχ = ε0. However, as the in-
tegrand of this component changes sign at ω = ε0,ε0 ± Γ0/4,
the contribution from the QD spin-polarization goes through
local minima at ε0 ± Γ0/4 and a local maxima at ε0, as a
function of the chemical potential µχ. We therefore expect
a competition between the charge and magnetic components
which may lead to a change of sign in the Heisenberg inter-
action, depending both on the properties of the system as well

as on the external conditions. This is illustrated by the com-
puted Heisenberg exchange plotted in Fig. 4 (a) as function
of the voltage bias for different gate voltages, showing the
changing character from negative to positive interaction as the
chemical potential µχ approaches the QD level. For ferro-
magnetic leads aligned anti-ferromagnetically in Fig. 4 (b),
pL = −pR = 0.5, we notice an anisotropic behaviour as the
sign of the interaction switches with respect to the polarity of
the voltage bias. This is in agreement with previous studies
of anti-ferromagnetically aligned leads coupled to molecular
spins [45].

The Ising interaction I essentially behaves in a similar
this contribution requires a ﬁnite spin-
manner, however,
polarization (G1 (cid:54)= 0) to become non-vanishing. For non-
magnetic leads, pχ = 0, this spin-polarization is provided by
the local spin moment and we ﬁnd that the Ising interaction ac-
quires the form given in Eq. (33), up to multiplying constants.
This is also veriﬁed by the numerically computed Ising inter-
action, shown in Fig. 5 (a) as function of the voltage bias for
different gating conditions. Again, for ferromagnetic leads
in anti-ferromagnetic alignment, pL = −pR = 0.5, there is a
switching behavior with respect to the polarity of the voltage
bias.

A similar switching behavior appears in the DM interaction
D, which is only considered for ferromagnetic leads aligned
anti-ferromagnetically, see Fig. 6 (a), where the DM interac-
tion is plotted as function of the voltage bias and for different
gating conditions. Varying the gate voltage it can be noticed
that there is a ﬁnite DM interaction only whenever the QD
electron level, ε0, lies in the window between the chemical
potentials in the leads spanned by the voltage bias. This is
understood since the DM interaction results from net current
ﬂow interacting with the local spin moment, as it requires si-
multaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symme-
tries to be ﬁnite.

We ﬁnally comment on the relevance for calculating the in-
teraction parameters in the stationary limit. This question is
justiﬁed since the effective spin Hamiltonian in the stationary

limit would assume the form

H eff

S =− J(H)S· S− D· S× S− S· I· S.

(34)
Here, one can notice that S· S = |S|2, which is a constant of
motion, whereas as S× S ≡ 0. Both these identities relies on
the fact that the spin S is time-independent in the stationary
limit. Actually, only the Ising interaction is physically moti-
vated, providing an anisotropy ﬁeld on the spin. For collinear
spin-polarization in the surrounding system, this contribution
reduces to the form IzzS2
z , which is the ordinary Ising Hamil-
tonian.

We justify the calculations and analysis of the stationary
limit interaction parameters by that we can understand and
interpret much of the time-dependent features, discussed in
the remainder of this paper, from the results obtained in the
stationary limit. In addition, our results also demonstrate that
despite the dynamics may be trivial, the ﬁelds that mediate the
interactions between the dynamical object need not be trivial.

B. Time-dependent exchange interaction

As we are interested in the transient dynamics, we study
the effect of an abrupt on-set of the voltage bias applied as a
step-like function Vχθ (t −t0) symmetrically over the junction
such that VL/R = ±V /2. Before the on-set of the voltage bias,
the local spin is subject to the static external magnetic ﬁeld

and we assume an initial polar angle of π/4.
The time-dependence of the interaction parameters, cf. Eq.
(9), has to be calculated as function of the gate voltage and
voltage bias at each time-step. In Fig. 7 we plot the time-
evolution of the Heisenberg, Ising, and DM interaction pa-
rameters as function of the gate voltage, where we integrated
over all t(cid:48), hence, showing JH (t), Izz(t) and Dz(t). Consid-
ered in this fashion, the plots illustrate the time-evolution of
the exchange interaction that would be expected in the adia-

batic approximation, that is,(cid:82) J(t,t(cid:48))· S(t(cid:48))dt(cid:48) ≈(cid:82) J(t,t(cid:48))dt(cid:48) ·

S(t) +···. In the transient regime, the interaction parameters
changes continuously, both due to the changing characteris-
tics of the system and the feed-back through the system from
the changing local magnetic moment. In the long time limit, it
may be noticed that the interaction strength peaks for all three
types of interactions when the QD electron level ε0 is reso-
nant with one of the chemical potentials of the leads µχ = eVχ.
We, hence, retain the properties of the system in the stationary
regime.

When going beyond the adiabatic approximation, one can-
not strictly separate the interaction parameters from the time-
evolution of the spin, see for instance Eq. (2). It is then more
comprehensible to directly study and analyze each component
of the equation of motion. Accordingly, in Fig. 8 we plot the
rates of change in the respective panels

(a) ˙Sz(t; εj) = −S(t)×(cid:82) [j(t,t(cid:48))]zdt(cid:48)/e,
(b) ˙Sz(t;J(H)) = −S(t)×(cid:82) J(H)(t,t(cid:48))Sz(t(cid:48))dt(cid:48)/e,

(d) ˙Sz(t) = −S(t)×(cid:82) Dz(t,t(cid:48))Sz(t(cid:48))dt(cid:48)/e.

The rate of change caused by the current induced magnetic
ﬁeld, ˙Sz(t, εj), shown in Fig. 8 (a), initially provides a large
contribution to the spin dynamics while it tends to zero in the

FIG. 9: Time-dependent evolution of the ﬁeld from the anisotropic

long time limit. This is to be expected since the time variations
of the charge current are largest immediately after the on-set
of the voltage bias. Far beyond the transient regime initiated
by this on-set, the temporal variations in the charge current are
much smaller which, therefore, also leads to a smaller induced
magnetic ﬁeld.

Similar behaviour appears for the Heisenberg, Ising and
DM interactions, shown in Fig. 8 (b) – (d), where they ini-
tially provides a large contribution to the spin dynamics in
the transient regime. Resulting from the time-dependent in-
teraction parameters, there is a ﬁnite contribution to the spin
dynamics for large time scales in the stationary limit, in agree-
ment with the time-independent solution. The difference,
however, is that there is a ﬁnite contribution in the station-
ary limit of the DM-interaction, something not observed in
the time-independent solution for non-magnetic leads. The
reason of this effect is because of the time-dependent feature
of the DM-ﬁelds. In Fig. 9 the effective ﬁeld from the DM
interaction is shown in the x- and y-components of the vector

deﬁned by (D· S)(t) =(cid:82) D(t,t(cid:48))· S(t(cid:48))dt(cid:48). The ﬁelds for the
Heisenberg and Ising contribution, i.e. (cid:82) JH (t,t(cid:48))S(t(cid:48))dt(cid:48) and
(cid:82) I(t,t(cid:48))× S(t(cid:48))dt(cid:48), are similar to the basic parameters shown
in Fig. 7,(cid:82) JH (t,t(cid:48))dt(cid:48) and(cid:82) I(t,t(cid:48))dt(cid:48).

C. Non-magnetic leads

Next, we study the time-dependent solution of the charge
and spin currents and the evolution of the local spin moment
for non-magnetic leads, pχ = 0. Here, we use Γ0 = v = 0.1
meV, T = 1 K, B = 1 T, pL = pL = 0, ε0 = 0 meV and V = 2
mV. Our computed charge current IC is shown in Fig. 10 for
step-like voltage biases V with different amplitudes, turned
on at time t = 0. The contour in Fig. 10 (a) shows the time-
evolution of IC(t) as function of V , while the plots in Fig. 10
(b) correspond to the traces indicated in panel (a). The current
acts as a response function to the step-like voltage bias ac-
cording to a well known and expected scheme and eventually
reaches the stationary regime. A direct inﬂuence of amplitude
of the voltage bias is the increasing the frequency of the cur-
rent oscillations as the voltage bias grows as well as increasing
decay time. For non-magnetic leads the inﬂuence of the local

9

fects in the spin currents in Fig. 11 (a) - (c) are both due to the
presence of the local spin moment and the current through the
system, as it depends on G1 = −vg0(cid:104)S(cid:105)g0. As the dynamics
of the local spin moment has a small dependence of the volt-
age bias, the time- and voltage-dependent changes of the spin
current is thus mainly due to the electron ﬂow in the system,
given by g0.

If there is no exchange coupling between the QD and the
local spin moment, i.e. v = 0, the spin moment would just
continue to rotate in the magnetic ﬁeld and there would not be
any induced spin currents in the system. This can be seen in
Fig. 12 (b)-(c) for a ﬁnite charge current through the system
in Fig. 12 (a). The interaction between the current through
the QD and the local spin moment increases as we turn on the
exchange coupling, thus changing the direction of the spin.
The scaling behavior depends on the interaction between the
QD and the local spin moment. The internal magnetic ﬁeld
scales linearly with the exchange coupling, εj ∝ v, and the
current mediated interaction scales quadratically, J ∝ v2. In
turn, these equations depends on the back-action from the spin
moment through the GF, deﬁned as G1 = −vg0(cid:104)S(cid:105)g0. The
scaling of the exchange coupling is thus v4 and in Fig. 12 (c)
we can observe a 16 times faster process for every doubling
of the exchange coupling. The spin current Fig. 12 (b) scales
linearly with exchange coupling, due to G1 = −vg0(cid:104)S(cid:105)g0, and
the charge current Fig. 12 (a) is independent of the exchange
coupling as it only depends on g0 for non-magnetic leads.

The QD electron level ε0 is adjusted by the gate voltage
V. In the stationary limit the charge current peaks when the
QD electron level lies between the chemical potential of the
leads and quickly diminish for higher and lower gate voltage.
Because of the effective Zeeman split in the QD there will be
ﬁnite spin currents that are strongly peaked at µχ = ε0. This
can also be observed in the long time limit for different gate
voltage, shown in Fig. 12 (d)-(e). Due to the asymmetry of
the time-dependent solution of the bare GF, where g0(t,t(cid:48)) is
not the same as g0(t(cid:48),t) around the onset of bias voltage, the
currents become asymmetric for small time scales depending
on the sign of the gate voltage. As this is a short term effect,
the asymmetry vanish as it reaches steady state. The evolution
of the local spin moment, shown in Fig. 8, depends on the
gate voltage as the strength of the interaction strongly depends
on the gate voltage, see Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. For zero gate
voltage, the local spin moment simply aligns with the leads,
as in Fig. 11 (f). When a ﬁnite gate voltage is applied, the QD
level is not symmetrically in between the leads, which both
gives a spin polarized current due to the Zeeman split and in
turn changes the action on the spin moment. This causes the
spin moment to reach different solutions in the steady state
depending on both the isotropic and anisotropic interactions
shown in Fig. 8.

Recalling that the charge current for non-magnetic leads is
given in the stationary limit by Eq. 31 we notice that it scales
with the tunneling coupling Γ0 as an Lorentzian. This can be
seen in the steady state limit in Fig. 12 (g) where the charge
current is plotted against different tunneling coupling. The
dependence of Γ0 in both the spin currents and the interaction
strength is as in Eqs. 32 – 33, where it is on the form Γ0/(1 +

FIG. 10: Charge current as a function of time, IC(t), for different

charge current as a function of bias voltage V is shown. In (b) the
cuts in (a) are shown for different bias voltage V. Here Γ0 = v = 0.2

magnetic moment S(t) on the current is negligible. Hence, the
essential time-dependent properties of the charge current are
captured by results provided in Refs. [56, 57].

In the case of non-magnetic leads both Γ1 = 0 and g1 = 0,
thus the only contribution to the spin-dependent dressed GF
comes from −vg0(cid:104)S(cid:105)g0. With no applied gate voltage this will
lead to zero spin currents in the stationary limit, cf. Fig. 3 (b).
This can be seen in Fig. 11 (a) - (c) where we show the spin
currents in the x-, y-, and z-direction for different bias volt-
ages. The local spin moment, initially at a polar angle π/4,
will due to the damping effect of the charge background align
in the z-direction, see Fig. 11 (d)-(e). The process will be
slower for a ﬁnite bias voltage than for zero voltage as there
are anisotropic effects in the system. The back-action via the
current in the junction causes this slower dynamics as it coun-
teracts the motion in Fig. 8 (notice that we have zero gate
voltage). Here, the induced internal magnetic ﬁeld and DM
interaction causes the spin to align in the positive z-direction,
whereas the Heisenberg and Ising interaction causes it to ﬂip
in the negative z-direction. Similar to this, the transient ef-

D. Ferromagnetic leads

We now study the system for different magnetization of the
leads. In Fig. 13 the different columns show different spin
polarization of the leads. In order to enhance the effects the
simulation was run with T = 1 µK and B = 1 µT. In Fig.
13 column (a) the magnetization is changed for both leads,
pL = pR = p, in a ferromagnetic alignment. As can be seen
in the stationary limit the spin current is then net positive or
net negative due to the spin polarization of the leads as ex-
pected. The charge current decreases some for strongly po-
larized leads as one of the spin species diminish, thus only
tunneling through either the spin up or down channel (see Fig.
2 (b) for illustration). If the drain lead is kept non-magnetic,
i.e. pL = p, pR = 0, this behavior becomes clearer, see Fig.
13 column (b). Here, a majority of spin up or spin down elec-
trons enters the QD while both have equal probability to exit.
The spin current through the junction becomes less polarized
because only one of the leads is ferromagnetic, while the other
is non-magnetic. The changes in charge current is large, be-
cause of the non-collinear arrangement of the leads. Similar
changes in charge and spin currents appears when the source
is kept non-magnetic, i.e. pL = 0, pR = p, see Fig. 13 column
(d).

When the source or drain lead is kept ferromagnetic, i.e.
pχ = 0.5,
the charge and spin current behavior changes
slightly, see Fig. 13 column (c) and (e). We get the highest
charge current when the leads are in ferromagnetic conﬁgura-
tion, while it is the lowest in anti-ferromagnetic conﬁguration.
The same happens for the spin current, where it is the highest
in ferromagnetic conﬁguration and goes to zero/negative when
the leads are in an anti-ferromagnetic conﬁguration. This is
well expected and agrees with a simple model of a QD be-
tween magnetic leads.

We notice that there is a slight difference between the spin
currents in Fig. 13 column (b) and (d) and the same for col-
umn (c) and (e). This is partly due to the asymmetry of the
source and drain leads which causes an effect on small time
scales when the bias voltage is turned on, where a spin up
injection causes a peak in the spin current and a spin down
a bottom.
It is also due to inﬂuence of the local spin mo-
ment in the junction which reaches different stationary solu-
tions, see the bottom row of Fig. 13, as the dressed GF de-
pends on the connection with the spin moment as is given
in Eq. 20. The difference is shown in Fig. 14 for the case
where one lead is kept non-magnetic and the spin polariza-
tion of the other lead is shifted. The plot shows the difference
z (pL = 0, pR = p)−IS
z (pL = p, pR = 0)]/IC. Hence, because
[IS
of the given polarity of the voltage bias the system is not in-
variant with respect to inversion symmetry, the conﬁgurations
pL = 0, pR = p and pL = p, pR = 0 are not equivalent under
ﬁnite voltage bias.

For ferromagnetic leads the interaction between the QD and
the spin moment changes. This causes the local spin moment

to change direction for different spin-polarized conﬁgurations
of the leads. The evolution of the spin moment for different
conﬁgurations is shown in the bottom row in Fig. 13. Due
to the anisotropic interactions I and D the local spin moment
anti-aligns with the source lead while it aligns with the drain
lead, see column (b) and (c). The effect is stronger from the
source lead than the drain lead as the source determines the
electron ﬂow into the system. In the small time scale, right
after the gate voltage is turned on, we can observe a dip in
the evolution of the spin moment before its reaches its sta-
tionary solution. This we can describe energetically as double
well potential, where the spin moment needs enough energy
in order to pass a barrier and reach a spin down solution. If
it does not have enough energy to pass the barrier it stays in
a spin up solution, see Fig. 15. In the present case the spin

is considered classical and the transition will be continuous,
while a quantum spin would tunnel through the potential bar-
rier for high enough energies. As we see in Fig. 13 column
(b) and (c), this conﬁguration favours a spin up solution, while
when the current is driven in the opposite direction, shown in
column (d) and (e), it favours a spin down solution. This is
illustrated by the different depths of the potential wells in Fig.
15. Due to the anisotropies in the system the spin moment
ends up differently depending on the anti-ferromagnetic con-
ﬁgurations of the leads. The anti-ferromagnetic conﬁguration
is the opposite in the bottom of the ﬁgures in column (c) and
(e) in the bottom row in Fig. 13, which will cause different
stationary solutions of the local spin moment. Thus, depend-
ing on the direction of the current through the dot one can use
the effective spin torque in order to control the spin, which is

row, where the left arrow indicates the polarization of the left lead and the right arrow indicates the right lead. The ﬁrst row shows the charge
current IC, the second row the spin currents IS
z and the third row shows the local magnetic moment in the z-direction Sz. In column (a) the
magnetization is changed for both leads, pL = pR = p. In column (b) the right lead is non-magnetic and the left lead is changed, pR = 0
and pL = p. In column (c) the right lead is ferromagnetic and the left lead is changed, pR = 0.5 and pL = p. In column (d) the left lead is
non-magnetic and the right lead is changed, pR = p and pL = 0. In column (e) the left lead is ferromagnetic and the right lead is changed,
pR = p and pL = 0.5. Here Γ0 = 0.1 meV, v = 0.25 meV, V = 2 mV, T = 1 µK, B = 1 µT , pL = pL = 0 and ε0 = 0 meV.

in Fig. 13 the spin moment starts up and then tries to reach a down

the other lead with different spin polarization. This plot corresponds
to the difference between columns (b) and (d) in the second row of

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In summary, we have studied the time evolution of a lo-
cal magnetic moment in a tunnel junction. We have shown
that one can control and read-out the local magnetic mo-
ment using gate voltage and using magnetic leads in an anti-

ferromagnetic set-up. This is in agreement with previous
works[45–47] and is a promising feature in order to perform
electrical control and read-out of magnetic molecules.

We have shown that non-trivial exchange interaction ap-
pears in the time-dependent domain, especially for small time
scales. Anisotropic effects occur due to time-dependency
which will effect the direction of the magnetic moment. A
large effective magnetic ﬁeld is a signiﬁcant effect that oc-
curs for small time scales and adjust the evolution of the local
magnetic moment, an effect not usually considered as it van-
ishes for the stationary solution. Considering time-dependent
exchange interaction is thus important in small time-scale cal-
culations and shows potential for a deeper understanding of
the exchange interaction. This leads to further questions on
how important the time-dependency is for large scale spin-
dynamics calculations, something suitable for further investi-
gation.

This work and previous have found that there is rich physics

13

within this framework and that it is important on the quan-
tum scale to take time-dependent non-equilibrium effects
into consideration when analyzing time-dependent phenom-
ena. Anisotropic exchange interactions play an important role
when studying time-dependent phenomena. With recent ex-
perimental advances we believe it to be possible to verify our
ﬁndings with state-of-the-art experiments.
