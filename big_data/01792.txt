The practically useful criteria of separable states ρ = Pk wkρk in d = 2 × 2 are discussed. The
equality G(a, b) = 4[hψ|P (a) ⊗ P (b)|ψi − hψ|P (a) ⊗ 1|ψihψ|1 ⊗ P (b)|ψi] = 0 for any two projection
operators P (a) and P (b) provides a necessary and suﬃcient separability criterion in the case of a
separable pure state ρ = |ψihψ|. We propose the separability criteria of mixed states, which are
given by Trρ{a · σ ⊗ b · σ} = (1/3)C cos ϕ for two spin 1/2 systems and 4Trρ{P (a) ⊗ P (b)} =
1 + (1/2)C cos 2ϕ for two photon systems, respectively, after taking a geometrical angular average of
a and b with ﬁxed cos ϕ = a · b. Here −1 ≤ C ≤ 1, and the diﬀerence in the numerical coeﬃcients
1/2 and 1/3 arises from the diﬀerent rotational properties of the spinor and the transverse photon.
If one instead takes an average over the states in the d = 2 Hilbert space, the criterion for two
photon systems is replaced by 4Trρ{P (a) ⊗ P (b)} = 1 + (1/3)C cos 2ϕ. Those separability criteria
are shown to be very eﬃcient using the existing experimental data of Aspect et al.
in 1981 and
Sakai et al. in 2006. When the Werner state is applied to two photon systems, it is shown that the
Hilbert space average can judge its inseparability but not the geometrical angular average.

INTRODUCTION

To characterize the entanglement, the notions of separability and inseparability,
which are the characteristic properties of state vectors in quantum mechanics, are
commonly used. On the other hand, the notion of local realism based on local
non-contextual hidden-variables models is also used to test the properties such as
locality and reduction [1, 2]. Local hidden-variables models are generally diﬀerent
from quantum mechanics, and thus local realism tests the deviation from quantum
mechanics also.

In the experimental study of local realism, which is commonly tested by CHSH
inequality [2], it is customary to ﬁrst conﬁrm the consistency of the measured basic
correlation such as the spin correlation ha · σ ⊗ b · σi with quantum mechanics and
then test the CHSH inequality. If one conﬁrms the consistency of ha · σ ⊗ b · σi
for any unit vectors a and b with quantum mechanics, one can naturally apply
the criterion of quantum mechanical separability to the correlation. In the present
study, we discuss this aspect of separability test in quantum mechanics. It is well
known that the Peres criterion of the positivity of partial transposed density matrix
gives a necessary and suﬃcient condition of separability of general density matrix in
d = 2×2 [3] which we study in the present paper. However, it is also well-known from
the days of Pauli [4] that the reconstruction of the state vector or density matrix
from measured data is in general very involved [5]. It is thus practically useful to
derive simpler criteria which do not require the precise state reconstruction. The

purpose of the present paper is to derive such separability criteria. We assume
the most general separable density matrix but we use a limited set of two-point
correlations and thus obtain only the necessary condition of separability in general.
Nevertheless, we illustrate that our criteria are very useful when applied to the past
experimental data of Aspect et al. in 1981 [6] and Sakai et al. in 2006 [7].

To be speciﬁc, we study the general separable quantum mechanical states

ρ = Xk

wkρk,

(1)

in d = 2× 2 = 4; all the states ρk are separable pure quantum states [8]. If the state
is a separable pure state ρ = |ψihψ|, separability in (1) is quantiﬁed by the equality,
which is necessary and suﬃcient,

G(a, b) ≡ 4[hψ|P (a) ⊗ P (b)|ψi − hψ|P (a) ⊗ 1|ψihψ|1 ⊗ P (b)|ψi] = 0,

(2)

for arbitrary two projection operators P (a) and P (b).

In the case of a general mixed ρ, we derive the useful criteria of separable mixed

states, namely

for two spin 1/2 systems, and

Trρ{a · σ ⊗ b · σ} = (1/3)C cos ϕ,

4Trρ{P (a) ⊗ P (b)} = 1 + (1/2)C cos 2ϕ,

(3)

(4)

for two photon systems with linear polarization projectors P (a) and P (b), respec-
tively: Here −1 ≤ C ≤ 1. The basic new ingredient in our derivation of these
criteria (3) and (4) is that we take a geometric angular average of unit vectors a
and b with ﬁxed cos ϕ = a · b. It is shown that this angular averaging, which is
originally motivated by the speciﬁc experiment [7], does not add a new burden to
measurements by analyzing the existing experimental data. The diﬀerence in the
numerical coeﬃcients 1/3 and 1/2 in (3) and (4) arises from the diﬀerence in rota-
tional properties; the spinor rotational freedom is 3-dimensional, which agrees with
the freedom of the d = 2 Hilbert space, while the rotational freedom of the photon
is two-dimensional, which diﬀers from the freedom of the d = 2 Hilbert space since
it is conﬁned in a plane perpendicular to the momentum direction. If one instead
takes an average over the states in the d = 2 Hilbert space, the formula for the
photon is replaced by

4Trρ{P (a) ⊗ P (b)} = 1 + (1/3)C cos 2ϕ.

(5)

This diﬀerence between the geometrical angular average and the Hilbert space av-
erage is interesting, and it has an interesting implication on the separability issue

3

of the Werner state [8] which accommodates a speciﬁc local hidden-variables rep-
resentation and thus satisﬁes CHSH inequality. In the case of photon, the Hilbert
space average can judge the inseparability of the Werner state but the geometrical
angular average cannot.

II. CRITERIA OF SEPARABILITY

in 1981 [6] and Sakai et al.

We discuss the separability criterion on the basis of explicit experimental data
in 2006 [7]. In these experiments,
by Aspects et al.
the authors emphasize a good agreement of the measured basic correlation such as
hP (a)⊗ P (b)i or the corresponding quantity for spin operators for any unit vectors
a and b with the predictions of quantum mechanics and then discuss the test of the
CHSH inequality. We instead formulate the separability criterion for the two-point
function

Trρ{P (a) ⊗ P (b)},

which inscribes much information about quantum mechanics in d = 2 × 2, and
discuss the entanglement from a point of view of separability.

Separability criterion of pure states:

We begin with the experimental analysis of separability for a pure state. The

experiments, which we use to test saparability, have been performed in the past
by Freedman and Clauser in 1972 [9] and Aspect, Grangier and Roger in 1981 [6]

4

(before the better known experiment in 1982 [10]). Those experiments are based on
the measurement of the transverse linear polarization of the photon. To rewrite our
relations, which are often written for spin operators, for the analysis of the photon
measurement, one may deﬁne the projection operator such as P (a) = (1 + a · σ)/2
or a· σ = 2P (a)− 1. The projector P (a) in the transverse direction is then formally
identiﬁed with the photon linear polarizer in the direction a; CHSH inequality based
on hidden-variables models is correctly described by this formal replacement, but
the properties under the rotation group, for example, cannot be correctly described
and a more careful treatment is required, as is explained later. We then obtain the
quantity

G(a, b) ≡ ha · σ ⊗ b · σi − ha · σ ⊗ 1ih1 ⊗ b · σi

= 4[hP (a) ⊗ P (b)i − hP (a) ⊗ 1ih1 ⊗ P (b)i],

(6)

corresponding to (2). In terms of measured quantities in [6] , G(ϕ) = G(a, b) is
written as

G(ϕ) = 4[

R1R2

]

= (0.971 − 0.029)(0.968 − 0.028)0.984 cos 2ϕ

(7)

where ϕ stands for the angle between a and b. The quantities R(ϕ), R1, R2 and
R0 are deﬁned in eq.(2) of [6], and the numerical factors which appear in front of
cos 2ϕ are also given in [6]. See also Refs. [2, 9].
Quantum mechanically, we have the prediction

for the (scalar) state

G(a, b) = cos 2ϕ

ψ = (1/√2)[|Hi1|Hi2 + |V i1|V i2]

(8)

(9)

of linearly polarized (horizontal |Hi and vertical |V i) photons, which we expect for
the cascade 61S0 → 41P1 → 41S0 in calcium [6]; this state corresponds to FµνF µν in
the 4-dimensional notation with Fµν standing for the Maxwell ﬁeld strength tensor,
and proportional to ~A(1)· ~A(2) in terms of the transverse vector potential. The mean
life of the intermediate state 41P1 is about 4.5 × 10−9 sec [11], and one may assume
no decoherence and thus a pure or close to pure two-photon state in the present
analysis. For the ideal measurement, the coeﬃcient of cos 2ϕ in (7) is expected
to be close to unity. In fact, the authors in [6] mentioned the good agreement of
measured results with quantum mechanical predictions.

We show the measured result of (7), which agrees well with the quantum me-
chanical prediction [6], in Fig.1 together with the prediction of separable state (2),

5

namely, a separable pure quantum state. Fig.1 shows that the criterion (2) applied
to (7) is very eﬀective and provides a good evidence of inseparability of measured
data by assuming a pure state.

Separability criteria of mixed states:

One may still argue that there is no guarantee that the two-photon state in [6]
is a pure state which we assumed in the analysis of our Fig.1, although the good
agreement of the observed data with the quantum mechanical prediction, as is noted
in [6], and the very fact that one can make a quantum mechanical prediction indi-
cates that the state is close to a pure state. To cope with this criticism and also
to deal with general mixed states, we next formulate convenient criteria to test the
separability of general mixed states in (1).

This formulation is motivated by the measurement of two-proton correlation by
Sakai et al. [7]. They measure a pair of massive spin 1/2 protons from the decay
of the short-lived (< 10−21 sec) 2He spin-singlet state [7]. The initial spin state is

most likely a pure state |ψsi = (1/√2)[|+i1|−i2 − |−i1|+i2]. For this maximally

entangled state, quantum mechanics predicts

G(a, b) = − cos ϕ,

(10)

for the quantity in (6). But the authors in [7] actually measured the quantity
corresponding to the quantum mechanical correlation

CQM (ϕ) = hψ|n(1) · σ ⊗ n(2) · σ|ψi,

(11)
with unit vectors n(1) and n(2). They did not measure hψ|n(1) · σ ⊗ 1|ψi and hψ|1 ⊗
n(2)·σ|ψi separately, and thus we cannot construct the quantity G(n(1), n(2)) deﬁned
in (6). They however mentioned that ”Thus, a measured value of Cexp(ϕ) = − cos ϕ,
which is same as CQM (ϕ), for n(1) and n(2) randomly rotated, is strong evidence that
the incident two protons are in the entangled state.” We thus deﬁne a quantity to
test the general separable mixed state in (1) by incorporating the angular average
in their measurement.
We start with an arbitrary separable pure quantum state |ψi = |s1i|s2i which
gives CQM (ϕ) = (s1 · n(1))(n(2) · s2). Here s1 and s2 stand for unit spin vectors which
deﬁne the pure state by |s1ihs1| = 1
2 [1 + s1 · σ], for example. The prediction of the
separable mixed state in (1) is thus written as

Trρ{n(1) · σ ⊗ n(2) · σ} = Z dΩs1dΩs2w(s1, s2)(s1 · n(1))(n(2) · s2)

(12)

where we use the continuum notation with R dΩs1dΩs2w(s1, s2) = 1 instead of the
discrete one, Pk wk = 1, in (1). This deﬁnes the most general separable mixed

states and thus naturally incorporates the positivity of partial transposed density
matrix. We emphasize that the geometrical average of the unit vector n covers all
the possible spin states in the d = 2 Hilbert space, which becomes crucial when one
compares the spin average with the average over photon polarization later. This
quantity becomes

after the angular averaging of n(1) and n(2) with ﬁxed cos ϕ = n(1)·n(2); note that the
angular average means the average with solid angle, namely, R cos2 θd cos θdφ/4π =
1/3. It is interesting that the separable state gives a non-trivial cos ϕ dependence
in CQM (ϕ). The quantity C in (13) is deﬁned by

C ≡ Z dΩs1dΩs2w(s1, s2)(s1 · s2)

(14)

which satisﬁes −1 ≤ C ≤ 1. The relation (13) is the prediction of separable quantum
states in (1). The measured value in [7], Cexp(ϕ) = − cos ϕ which is same as quantum
mechanical prediction [7] (expected in their experimental setting), contradicts the
prediction CQM (ϕ)mixed and thus clearly shows inseparability. See Fig.2.

separable mixed quantum state in eq.(13), and the solid line is the experimental result Cexp(ϕ) = − cos ϕ
of Sakai et al. [7]

Similarly, one may consider the angular averaging of the photon case, but the
angular average of the spinor and the photon is diﬀerent. To analyze this issue, we

start with a general quantum state in the d = 2 Fock space,

|α, γi = cos αe−iγˆa†

+|0i + sin αˆa†

−|0i

7

(15)

which is parameterized by two real numbers α and γ. We have [ˆa±, ˆa†
±] = 1 and
ˆa±|0i = 0. The second quantized operator for the photon propagating in z-direction
with p = (0, 0,|p|) is given by (in d = 2 subspace by ignoring all the space-time
indices)

ˆA(p) = u+ˆa+ + u−ˆa− + h.c.,

where one may choose the polarization vectors in the x − y plane as

u+ = (cid:18) 1

0 (cid:19) ,

u− = (cid:18) 0

1 (cid:19) ,

(16)

(17)

without writing the vanishing z component; ± states may be termed as x and y
states or H and V states. Note that p · ˆA(p) = 0 due to the Coulomb condition.
The wave function in the sense of the ﬁrst quantization is given by
ψ(α, γ) = h0| ˆA(p)|α, γi = cos αe−iγu+ + sin αu−.

(18)

We deﬁne the projection operator specifying the measured linear polarization of the
photon, which is chosen by the experimental setup, by

P (θ) = |θ, 0ihθ, 0|

(19)

using the state in (15) with 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π; namely α = θ and γ = 0 in (15). The
general separable state may be deﬁned in terms of the states in (15) by

ρ = Z dΩ1dΩ2w(θ1/2, φ1; θ2/2, φ2)|θ1/2, φ1i|θ2/2, φ2ihθ1/2, φ1|hθ2/2, φ2|

(20)

using the ”rotation” invariant volume element, which is analogous to the separable

mixed spin states in (12), with R dΩ1dΩ2w(θ1/2, φ1; θ2/2, φ2) = 1. We now evaluate

(21)
4hθ1/2, φ1|hθ2/2, φ2|P (θa) ⊗ P (θb)|θ1/2, φ1i|θ2/2, φ2i
= [1 + cos 2θa cos θ1 + sin 2θa sin θ1 cos φ1][1 + cos 2θb cos θ2 + sin 2θb sin θ2 cos φ2]

which becomes

(23)

C = Z dΩ1dΩ2w(θ1/2, φ1; θ2/2, φ2)[cos θ1 cos θ2 + sin θ1 cos φ1 sin θ2 cos φ2]

(24)

which is bounded by −1 ≤ C ≤ 1, if one recalls that v1 · v2 = cos θ1 cos θ2 +
sin θ1 cos φ1 sin θ2 cos φ2 when one deﬁnes a vector v = (cos θ, sin θ cos φ) whose mag-
nitude is smaller than unity. The term with sin 2ϕ in (22) vanishes if one assumes
that the positive semi-deﬁnite weight factor w(θ1/2, φ1; θ2/2, φ2) contains only the
components symmetric under 1 ↔ 2, which is a natural assumption.
This prediction (23) of the separable mixed state in (1) that is formulated without
assuming a pure state contradicts the experimental result given in (7)

Cexp(ϕ) = 0.996 + 0.88 cos 2ϕ,

(25)

which agrees well with the quantum mechanical prediction [6], and thus the data
clearly show inseparability. See Fig.3. As for the justiﬁcation of angular averaging,
the authors in [6] mentioned that, ”we never observed any deviation from rotational
invariance”. In passing, we mention that the two-photon state expected in the decay
of a pseudo-scalar state ( a spin 0 state with negative parity) ǫµναβFµνFαβ in the 4-
dimensional notation and proportional to ~k· ( ~A(1)× ~A(2)) in terms of the transverse
potential,

gives

ψps = (1/√2)[|Hi1|V i2 − |V i1|Hi2]

Cps(ϕ) = 1 − cos 2ϕ

(26)

(27)

in contrast to Cs(ϕ) = 1 + cos 2ϕ for the scalar state in (9). This prediction is also
tested by the criterion of separable mixed states in Fig.3.

The diﬀerence in the numerical coeﬃcients in front of C in (13) and (23) arises
from the fact that the geometrical angular averaging procedure we perform is 3-
dimensional for the spin 1/2 freedom while it is 2-dimensional for the linear polar-
ization of the photon which is conﬁned in the plane perpendicular to the momentum
direction. One may ask if it is possible to obtain 1/3 for the photon? It is possible
if one takes an average in the d = 2 Hilbert space; one may deﬁne the projection
operator for the linearly polarized photon using the states in (15) by

P (θ/2, φ) = |θ/2, φihθ/2, φ|

instead of (19). One then obtains

(33)

which is bounded by −1 ≤ C ≤ 1. In the ﬁnal expression in (32), one may replace
cos ˜ϕ → cos 2ϕ to compare it with the previous expression (23).
Physically, what is involved in the second procedure in (32) is to consider the
average over the states

|θ/2, φi = cos θ/2e−iφˆa†

+|0i + sin θ/2ˆa†

−|0i

(34)

10

by not only changing θ by geometric operations but also by applying the ”phase
shifter” to the state ˆa†
+|0i to generate the states with various φ. Since we take an
average over a larger class of states, the coeﬃcient in (32) is made smaller to 1/3.
Those formulas (13) and (23) (and also (32)) provide convenient criteria to test
separability without an explicit reconstruction of the state ρ from the measured data.
The angular averaging is required for these formulas to be a test of separability, but
it does not appear to be diﬃcult to implement the angular averaging in actual
experiments, as the past experiments we discussed indicate [6, 7].

We here mention the well-known Werner state [8],

ρw =

1 +

(35)

2|ψsihψs|

with the spin singlet state |ψsi = (1/√2)[|+i1|−i2−|−i1|+i2], which accommodates

a speciﬁc hidden-variables representation and thus satisﬁes CHSH inequality. This
state is rotation invariant and gives rise to

Trρw(a · σ ⊗ b · σ) = −

1
2

cos ϕ

(36)

which violates the separability criterion (13) and thus inseparable. The explicit
example of the Werner state shows that local realism (local hidden-variables models)
and quantum mechanical separability are logically independent notions.

It is interesting to examine the Werner state when it is applied to two photon
systems. If one chooses the state |ψsi in (35) as the photon state |ψpsi given in (26),
one obtains

4Trρw(P (θa) ⊗ P (θb)) = 1 −

1
2

cos 2ϕ

(37)

for which we cannot judge separability using the criterion (23). This failure of the
separability criterion is analogous to the failure of CHSH inequality. Instead, we
need to consider the projector in (28) for the Werner state,

4Trρw(P (θa/2, φa) ⊗ P (θb/2, φb)) = 1 −

1
2

cos ˜ϕ

(38)

and compare this expression with the separability criterion (32) to judge the insep-
arability of the Werner state. (If one uses the photon state |ψi in (8), one obtains
1 + 1
2 cos ˜ϕ in (38), respectively.) This analysis suggests that
we need to consider a larger class of detector states in (28) to detect inseparability
of the Werner state by photon measurements,.

(39)

P ij
kl|iihj| ⊗ |lihk|

ρT2 = Xijkl
for the original ρ = Pijkl P ij
kl|iihj| ⊗ |kihl|, which gives a necessary and suﬃcient
separability condition for d = 2× 2 systems [3], can be used in combination with the
state reconstruction of two linearly polarized photons such as in [5]. But in practice
the reconstruction of the state ρ from the measured data is generally involved [5].
We have instead presented simpler formulas (13) and (23), which incorporate the an-
gular averaging of measured two-point correlations while assuming the most general
separable density matrix. Our simpliﬁed test of separability nicely works without
any extra cost such as the state reconstruction, and the ﬁnal outcome in Fig.1 -
Fig.3 may be favorably compared with the standard test of CHSH inequality [6, 7],
although our formula tests separability while CHSH inequality tests locality and
thus not identical. From the point of view of separability, CHSH inequality and
our relation (2) both give the necessary and suﬃcient condition for any pure state,
while CHSH inequality and our relations (3) and (4) both give only the necessary
condition for mixed states. The Werner state is tested by our criterion in the case of
spin, but in the case of photon one needs the information coming from the Hilbert
space averaging.

We here mention a past work on the test of entanglement [12] which is closely
related to the present study. A comprehensive and comparative study of various
separability criteria has been given in [13]. The authors in [12] show that the sepa-
rability of the density matrix for a two-spin system is characterized by an algebraic
inequality derived from Robertson’s uncertainty relations for Pauli matrices. The
algebraic inequality is shown to give a necessary and suﬃcient separability crite-
rion for the two-spin system in d = 2 × 2, and thus the inequality can be used in
place of the positivity of partial transposed density matrix. However, it remains
hard to conﬁrm the separability of an unknown state in practice because one has to
check the proposed inequality for all sets of local complementary (non-commuting)
observables, despite of the fact that the analysis in [12] ensures in principle a viola-
tion of the inequality for any entangled state by choosing properly the local testing
observables.

The authors of [12] also suggest a simple necessary condition of separability by
just measuring 3 correlations hσ1 ⊗ σ1i,

hσ3 ⊗ σ3i and examining

hσ2 ⊗ σ2i,

− 1 ≤ hσ1 ⊗ σ1i + hσ2 ⊗ σ2i + hσ3 ⊗ σ3i ≤ 1

(40)

in the case of spin 1/2 systems. This condition is based on the equality

12

(41)

(s1 · s2) = hs1|hs2|[σ1 ⊗ σ1 + σ2 ⊗ σ2 + σ3 ⊗ σ3]|s1i|s2i,

which is bounded by unity. The expected initial spin state |ψsi = (1/√2)[|+i1|−i2−
|−i1|+i2] in [7] gives hψs|σ1 ⊗ σ1|ψsi = hψs|σ2 ⊗ σ2|ψsi = hψs|σ3 ⊗ σ3|ψsi = −1, and
this comparison shows the inseparability of the state |ψsi and provides information
to understand the criterion at ϕ = 0 in Fig.2. This analysis, when applied to the test
of the inseparability of the Werner state ρw in (35), leads to the same conclusion
as our relation (36) at ϕ = 0;
it is known that β ≤ 1/3 is the necessary and
suﬃcient condition of separability if one replaces the coeﬃcient 1/2 of the singlet
state appearing in the Werner state (35) by β [8], namely, ρw = 1
4(1−β)1+β|ψsihψs|.
For the photon case instead of the spin 1/2 case discussed in (41), one can show

the relation

ψ†(θ1/2, φ1)ψ†(θ2/2, φ2)[σ1 ⊗ σ1 + σ3 ⊗ σ3]ψ(θ1/2, φ1)ψ(θ2/2, φ2)
= cos θ1 cos θ2 + sin θ1 cos φ1 sin θ2 cos φ2,

in terms of separable wave functions in (20), which predicts

− 1 ≤ hσ1 ⊗ σ1i + hσ3 ⊗ σ3i ≤ 1

(42)

(43)

for the general separable states in (20). Here Pauli spinors act on the qubit states
deﬁned by the photon. In comparison, one can conﬁrm the relation ψ†[σ1⊗σ1 +σ3⊗
σ3]ψ = 2 for the singlet (scalar) wave function ψ in (8), and ψ†
ps[σ1⊗σ1+σ3⊗σ3]ψps =
−2 for the pseudo-scalar wave function ψps in (25). The comparison of these relations
shows the inseparability of both ψ in (8) and ψps in (25), and it provides information
to understand the curves at the point ϕ = 0 in Fig.3 (if one corrects the overall shift
by unity), although the geometrical meaning of the correlations in (43) in the real
3-dimensional space is not obvious.

It may be interesting to note that the analysis in [12] is closely related to the
analysis by Simon [14] who studied the separability criterion for the two-party system
with a one-dimensional continuous freedom in each party by writing an algebraic
inequality based on the positivity of partial transposed density matrix; the number
of independent linear operators is 4 since the phase space dimensionality is d =
2 × 2 in [14]. The criterion, which provides a necessary and suﬃcient separability
condition for Gaussian states in quantum optics [14, 15], has been later shown to
agree with an inequality based on Kennard’s uncertainty relation [16]. It appears
that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle accounts most of separability criteria in
lower dimensional systems.

The test of separability and the test of local realism are closely related in that
both test entanglement but there is a crucial diﬀerence. The separability is based

13

on quantum mechanics while the test of local realism is based on local hidden-
variables models and thus generally tests the deviation from quantum mechanics
also. The probability interpretation of quantum mechanics and hidden-variables
models are based on the notion of valuation. The valuation is deﬁned as the prob-
ability measure v which assigns non-negative values v(Pk) to any set of complete

orthogonal projection operators Pk Pk = 1 by preserving the linearity condition
v(Pk Pk) = Pk v(Pk) = 1. A general analysis [17–19] shows that such a mea-
sure is inevitably given by a trace representation v(Pk) = T r(ρPk) with a suitable
trace-class operator ρ [20] for the dimensions of the Hilbert space d ≥ 3, and no
deterministic (dispersion-free v(P 2
k ) − v(Pk)2 = 0) representation of v such as in
hidden-variables models is possible for d ≥ 3. There is also an analysis [21] which
asserts that, if one adopts POVMs, Pk Ek = 1, instead of projection operators, those
{Ek} are jointly measurable in a single experiment [21] but no deterministic repre-
sentation of v with v(Pk Ek) = Pk v(Ek) = 1 (by maintaining the dispersion-free
condition v(E2
k)− v(Ek)2 = 0) is possible even in d = 2, while a trace representation
v(Ek) = T r(ρEk) of von Neumann is always possible. If one should adopt this last
point of view, no sensible local non-contextual hidden-variables models in d = 2 × 2
would be deﬁned. In such a case, the separability provides an indispensable test of
entanglement.
