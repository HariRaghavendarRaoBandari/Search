1 Introduction

Investigation of the vertex operator algebras V S4
L2 plays an important part in the
classiﬁcation of rational vertex operator algebras with c = 1. The vertex operator algebra
V G
L2 consists of G invariants of the even lattice vertex operator algebra VL2.

L2 and V A5

In the literature of physics at character level, references [27] and [31] studied classiﬁ-
cation of rational vertex operator algebras with c = 1. These two references are based
on two assumptions. one assumption is that the sum of the square norm of irreducible
characters is invariant under the modular group. The second assumption is that each
irreducible character is a modular function over a congruence subgroup. Reference [31]
states that the character of a rational vertex operator algebra with c = 1 is the character
of one of the vertex operators,

Reference [9] indicates that the list above would not be correct if the eﬀective central
charge ˜c, by Reference [20], and the central charge c were diﬀerent. Reference [20] charac-
terizes the vertex operator algebra VL for any positive deﬁnite even lattice L by c, ˜c, and
the rank of the weigh one subspace as a Lie algebra. References [9] [5] [10] [40] characterize
the orbifold vertex operator algebra V +
L . References [11] [12] [13] characterize the vertex
operator algebra V A4
L2 . Reference [11] states the rationality and the C2-coﬁniteness of V A4
L2 .
Since A4 is of order two in S4, the C2coﬁniteness of V A4
implies the C2 coﬁniteness of
L2
V S4
L2 , by Reference [34].

Let V be a rational vertex operator algebra and G be a ﬁnite automorphism group of
V . Orbifold theory conjecture indicates that V G is rational and each irreducible V G-
module occurs in an irreducible g-twisted V -module for some g ∈ G. The second half of
the conjecture is closed in Reference [6]. So, irreducible V S4
L2 -modules are classiﬁed. Also,
the vertex operator algebra V G
L2, where G ∈ {A4, S4, A5}, is in the above list of rational
vertex operator algebras. With the assumption of rationality and C2-coﬁniteness, irre-
ducible modules of V A5

L2 can be determined.

Reference [14] deﬁnes and studies the quantum dimension and the globe dimension for
a V -module. Also, Reference [14] provides a quantum Galois theory V G ⊆ V , by Refer-
ences [19] [28]. The results in Reference [14] are strengthened in Reference [6], and are
important in determining irreducible modules of V S4

L2 and V A5
L2 .

2 Preliminaries

Let (V, Y, 1, ω) be a vertex operator algebra and g an automorphism of V of ﬁntie order
T . Denote the decomposition of V into eigenspaces with respect to the action of g as

V = Mr∈Z/T Z

V r,

where V r = {v ∈ V |gv = e−2πir/T v}. Use r to denote both an integer between 0 and
T − 1 and its residue class mod T in this situation.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A weak g-twisted V -module M is a vector space equipped with a linear
map

where δ(z) = Pn∈Z zn and all binomial expressions (here and below) are to be expanded

in nonnegative integral powers of the second variable.

Deﬁnition 2.2. A g-twisted V -module is a C-graded weak g-twisted V -module M :

M = Mλ∈C

Mλ

where Mλ = {w ∈ M|L(0)w = λw} and L(0) is the component operator of Y (ω, z) =
Pn∈Z L(n)z−n−2. We also require that dim Mλ is ﬁnite and for ﬁxed λ, M n
T +λ = 0 for all
small enough integers n.

If w ∈ Mλ, call λ as the weight of w and write λ = wtw.
Use Z+ to denote the set of nonnegative integers.

module M :

M = Mn∈ 1

satisfying

dinary and admissible V -modules.

where M(n)∗ = HomC(M(n), C). The vertex operator YM ′(a, z) is deﬁned for a ∈ V via

hYM ′(a, z)f, ui = hf, YM (ezL(1)(−z−2)L(0)a, z−1)ui,

where hf, wi = f (w) is the natural paring M ′ × M → C. It follows from References [25]
and [39] that (M ′, YM ′) is an admissible g−1-twisted V -module. Deﬁne the contragredient
module M ′ for a g-twisted V -module M. In this case, M ′ is a g−1-twisted V -module.
Moreover, M is irreducible if and only if M ′ is irreducible.

Deﬁnition 2.4. A vertex operator algebra V is called g-rational, if the admissible g-
twisted module category is semisimple. V is called rational if V is 1-rational.

There is another important concept called C2-coﬁniteness, by Reference [41].

Deﬁnition 2.5. A vertex operator algebra V is C2-coﬁnite if V /C2(V ) is ﬁnite dimen-
sional, where C2(V ) = hv−2u|v, u ∈ V i.
The following results about g-rational vertex operator algebras are well-known, by Refer-
ences [16], [17].

Theorem 2.6. If V is g-rational, the following statements hold.

• (1) Any irreducible admissible g-twisted V -module M is a g-twisted V -module. More-
Z+Mλ+n where Mλ 6= 0. The

over, there exists a number λ ∈ C such that M = ⊕n∈ 1
λ is called the conformal weight of M;

T

• (2) There are only ﬁnitely many irreducible admissible g-twisted V -modules up to

isomorphism.

• (3) If V is also C2-coﬁnite and gi-rational for all i ≥ 0 then the central charge c
and the conformal weight λ of any irreducible g-twisted V -module M are rational
numbers.

Let V be a simple vertex operator algebra and G a ﬁnite and faithful group of auto-
morphisms of V , and let Irr (G) denote the set of simple characters χ of G. Now as
CG-module, each homogeneous space Vn of V is of ﬁnite dimensional, and so there is a
direct sum decomposition of V into graded subspaces
V = ⊕χ∈IrrGV χ,

where V χ is the subspace of V on which G acts according to the character χ. In other
words, if Mχ is the simple CG-module aﬀording χ, then V χ is the Mχ-homogeneous
subspace of V in the sense of group representation theory.

Theorem 2.1. By Reference [20] , suppose that V is a simple vertex operator algebra and
that G is a ﬁnite and faithful solvable group of automorphisms of V . Then for χ ∈ Irr (G),
each V χ is a simple module for the G-graded vertex operator algebra CG⊗ V G of the form

where Mχ is the simple CG-module aﬀording χ and where Vχ is a simple V G-module.

V χ = Mχ ⊗ Vχ,

4

Theorem 2.2. By reference [8]), let V be a simple vertex operator superalgebra and G a
ﬁnite solvable subgroup of Aut (V ). Suppose that V G is rational. Then V is g-rational for
any g ∈ G.
For a V -module M with grading M = ⊕Mn, deﬁne the formal character as

chqM = q− c

24 X dim Mnqn = trq− c

24 +L(0).

Denote the holomorphic function chqM by ZM (τ ). Here and below, τ is in the upper half
plane H and q = e2πiτ .

Let V be a rational, C2-coﬁnite vertex operator algebra with central charge c. Zhu,
in Reference [41], proved that the space

Dq|a1|

1

· · · q|an|

n trW Y (a1, q1)· · · Y (an, qn) qL(0)−c/24 : W irreducible V -modules E

is SL2 (Z)-invariant with ai ∈ V|ai|, where qj = qzj = e2πizj and |ai| denotes the weight
of aj. The concept of g-twisted modules for a ﬁnite automorphism g was introduced in
Reference [17] and the modular invariance of the space

(cid:10)trM gnqL(0)−c/24 : n ∈ Z, M g-twisted modules(cid:11)

was proved there.

Let M 0,· · · , M d be the inequivalent irreducible V -modules where M 0 ∼= V . Deﬁne

Zi (u, v, τ ) = trM ie2πi(v(0))+(v,u)/2qL(0)+u(0)+(u,u)/2−c/24

for u, v ∈ V1.
Theorem 2.3. By Reference [33], let V be a rational, C2-coﬁnite vertex operator algebra
of CFT type. Assume u, v ∈ V1 such that u, v span an abelian Lie subalgebra of V1. Let
c d (cid:19) ∈ SL (2, Z) . Then Zi (u, v, q) converges to a holomorphic function in the
γ = (cid:18) a b

upper half plane and

Zi (u, v, γτ ) =

d

Xj=0

γi,jZj (au + bv, cu + dv, τ ) ,

where γi,j ∈ C are independent of the choice of u, v, γτ = aτ +b
cτ +c .
The convergence of these functions has been established in Reference [18].
The quantum dimensions of modules for vertex operator algebras are deﬁned and their
properties are discussed in Reference [14]. It is well known that qdimV M can be deﬁned
as the limit of ChqM
ChqV as q goes to 1 from the left. The advantage of this deﬁnition is

5

that one can use the modular transformation property of the q-characters, by Reference
[41], and Verlinde formula, by References [30] [37], to compute quantum dimensions and
investigate their properties. The quantum dimensions for rational and C2-coﬁnite vertex
operator algebras have some nice properties which enable us to determine fusion rules
when the quantum dimensions can be calculated. The following are some properties of
quantum dimensions, by Reference [14].

Deﬁnition 2.4. Let V be a vertex operator algebra and M a g-twisted V -module such
that ZV (τ ) and ZM (τ ) exists. The quantum dimension of M over V is deﬁned as

qdimV M = lim
y→0

ZM (iy)
ZV (iy)

,

where y is real and positive.

By Reference [17], there is a natural action of Aut(V ) on twisted modules. Let g, h be
two automorphisms of V with g of ﬁnite order. If M, Yg is a weak g-twisted V -module,
there is a weak hgh−1 twisted V modules (M ◦ h), Yhgh−1 where M ◦ h ∼= M as vector
spaces and

Yhgh−1(v, z) = Yg(h−1v, z)

for v ∈ V . this deﬁnes a left action of Aut(V ) on weak twisted V -modules and on iso-
morphism classes of weak twisted V -modules and on isomorphism classes of weak twisted
V -modules. Symbolically, write

h ◦ (M, Yg) = (M ◦ h, Yhgh−1) = h ◦ M.

Sometimes abuse notation slightly by identifying M, Yg with the isomorphism class that
it deﬁnes.

If g, h commute, obviously h acts on the g-twisted modules as above. Set M (g) to
be the equivalence classes of irreducible g-twisted V -modules and M (g, h) = {M ∈
M (g)|h ◦ M ∼= M}. Then, for any M ∈ M (g, h), there is a g-twisted V -module isomor-
phism

ϕ(h) : h ◦ M → M.
The linear map ϕ(h) is unique up to a nonzero scalar.

Deﬁnition 2.5. By Reference [14], deﬁne the global dimension of V as

(qdimV M i)2.

glob(V ) =

d

3 Basic results of irreducible modules

In the rest of the paper, assume the following if not speciﬁed.

• (V1) V = ⊕n≥0Vn is a simple vertex operator algebra of CFT type,
• (V2) G is a ﬁnite automorphism group of V and V G is a a vertex operator algebra

of CFT type,

• (V3) V G is C2-coﬁnite and rational,
• (V4) The conformal weight of any irreducible V G-module N is nonnegative and is

zero if and only if N = V G.

Let V be a vertex operator algebra, (W, Y )an irreducible V -module, and g an automor-
phism of V . Deﬁnite a linear map

by

Y σ : V → (End W )[[z, z−1]]

Y σ(u, z)w = Y (σ−1(u), z)w,

where u ∈ V , and w ∈ W . Reference [16] shows that (W, Y σ) is an irreducible V -module.
Denote (W, Y σ) by W σ.
Deﬁnition 3.1. By Reference [16], a V -module W is g stable if W ∼= W σ.
Theorem 3.2. By Reference [16], the cardinalities |M (g, h)| and |M (gahc, gbhd)| are
equal for any (g, h) ∈ P (V ) and γ ∈ Γ. In particular, the number of irreducible g-twisted
V -module is exactly the number of irreducible V -modules which are g-stable.

The next two lemmas are from Reference [19], and provide a practical way to construct
irreducible V G modules.

Lemma 3.3. Let V be a vertex operator algebra with an automorphism g of order T .
M(n) be an irreducible g-twisted admissible V -Module. Then M i =

T +Z M(n) is an irreducible V hgi-module for i = 0, . . . , T − 1.

Let M = Pn∈ 1
Ln∈ i
Lemma 3.4. Let V be a simple vertex operator algebra, g an automorphism of V of
prime order p, and M an irreducible V -module such that g ◦ M is not isomorphic to M
as V -modules. Then, M is an irreducible V hgi-module.

The next two theorems are from Reference [6], and are the key theorems in determining
irreducible modules of a rational, C2 coﬁnite vertex operator algebra.
Theorem 3.5. Let g, h ∈ G, M an irreducible g-twisted V -module, N an irreducible
h-twisted V -module. Also assume that M, N are not in the same orbit of S under the
action of G. Then
1) Each Mλ for λ ∈ ΛGM ,αM is an irreducible V G-module.
2) For any λ ∈ ΛGM ,αM and µ ∈ ΛGN ,αN , the irreducible V G-modules Mλ and Nµ are
inequivalent.

7

Theorem 3.6. Any irreducible V G-module is isomorphic to an irreducible V G-submodule
Mλ for some irreducible g-twisted V -module M and some λ ∈ ΛGM ,αM .
Remark 3.7. Theorem 3.6 shows that there are two types of irreducible V G modules
modules.

• An irreducible V G module M is of type one if M occurs in the decomposition of

irreducible V modules, as V G modules.

• An irreducible V G module M is of type two if M does not occur in the decomposition
of irreducible V modules, as V G modules. That is, M occurs in a g twisted V G
module for some g ∈ G and g 6= 1.

Theorem 3.8. Let V be a rational vertex operator algebra, and G an automorphism of
V . Let H be a subgroup of G such that CG(h) = H for each h ∈ H. Assume that V H
is rational. (Note that V G is not necessarily to be rational). Then, an irreducible V H
module of type two is an irreducible V G module of type two.

Proof. Let M be an irreducible V H module of type two. Then it occurs in some g-twisted
V module N with g ∈ H. Let GN be the subgroup of G consisting of h ∈ G such that
N ◦ h ∼= N. Note that GN ⊂ CGh = H. So, GN is the subgroup of H consisting of h ∈ H
such that N ◦ h ∼= N. Let (GN , αN ) be a projective representation of GN on N. Theorem
3.5 shows that
(3.1)

N = Mλ∈irr(GN ,αN )

Wλ ⊗ Nλ.

Then M = Nλ for some λ. Since each Nλ is an irreducible V G module, M is an irreducible
V G module. (cid:3)

Theorem 3.9. By Reference [6], one has

qdimV GM = |G|qdimV M.

for any irreducible g-twisted V -module M.

Theorem 3.10. By Reference [6], one has the following relation,

glob(V G) = |G|2glob(V ).

Theorem 3.11. By Reference [13], let V be a rational, C2-coﬁnite vertex operator algebra
with central charge c and M 0,· · · , M d be the inequivalent irreducible V -modules with
M 0 ∼= V . Then qdimM i = qdim (M i)σ.
Theorem 3.12. Let V be a vertex operator algebra, and G an automorphism group of V .
Let H1 and H2 be two subgroups of G such that g−1H1g = H2 for some g ∈ G, that is, H1
and H2 are conjugate under G. Let M1 be an irreducible V H1 module. Then, there exists
an irreducible V H2 module, M2 such that as VG modules, M1 ∼= M2.

8

Proof. Let h2 ∈ H2, v ∈ V H1. Then, there exists h1 ∈ H1 such that g−1h1g = h2, that is
g−1h1 = h2g−1

h2(g−1v) = g−1h1v

= g−1v.

This shows that g−1v ∈ V H2. Hence, g−1V H1 ⊆ V H2. Likewise, gVH2 ⊆ V H1. Thus,

V H2 = g−1(gV H2)

⊆ g−1V H1
⊆ V H2.

So, g−1V H1 = V H2.

Let M1 ◦ g ∼= M1 as vector spaces. Consider (M1 ◦ g, YM1◦g) as a V H2 module. For
v ∈ V H2, deﬁne

YM1◦g(v, z) := YM1(gv, z).

The fact g−1V H1 = V H2 shows that YM1◦g is well deﬁned, because g is an automorphism
of V . Write

(M1, YM1) ◦ g = (M1 ◦ g, YM1◦g) = M1 ◦ g.

Let N be a submodule of M1◦ g, as V H2 modules. Then, N ◦ g−1 is a submodule of M1, as
V H1 modules. The fact that M1 is an irreducible V H1 module shows that N ◦ g−1 is trivial
in M1. Thus, N = ((N◦g−1)◦g) is trivial in M1◦h. So, M1◦g is an irreducible V H2 module.
Let w ∈ V G. Then, gw = w, and hence YG(w, z) = YG(gw, z). That is, M1 ◦ g ∼= M1, as
VG modules. (cid:3)
Remark 3.13. Denote by M (H) the set of all irreducible modules of V H . Let {Hi|i ∈ I}
be a conjugacy class of an automorphism group G. Theorem 3.12 shows that M (Hi), for
i ∈ I, are the same, as V G modules.
Recall the deﬁnition of Schur covering group. The following materials are based on Ref-
erences [38] [29] [36].

Deﬁnition 3.14. A group homomorphism from D to G is said to be a Schur cover of the
ﬁnite group G if:

• 1. the kernel is contained both in the center and the derived subgroup of D, and
• 2. amongst all such homomorphism, this D has maximal size.

A group D is a Schur covering group for G if there is a Schur cover from D to G.

The Schur covers of the symmetric and alternating groups were classiﬁed.

9

Theorem 3.15. The symmetric group of degree n ≥ 4 has two isomorphic classes of
Schur covers, both of order 2 · n!. Then alternating group of degree n has one isomorphic
class of Schur covers, which has order n! except when n is 6 or 7.

Theorem 3.16. For n = 4, the Schur cover of the alternating group A4 is given by
SL(2, 3) → P SL(2, 3) ∼= A4. The Schur covers of the symmetric group S4 are GL(2, 3)
and binary octahedral group. For n = 5, the Schur cover of the alternating group A5 is
given by SL(2, 5) → P SL(2, 5) ∼= A5.
There is a construction of Schur covering group for A4. Let π : SU(2) → SO(3) be the
natural homomorphism. There is a injective homomorphism i : A4 → SO(3) such that
π−1(i(A4)) is a Schur covering group of A4.

Since A4 has only one 3-dimensional irreducible representation, for any injective homo-
morphism i : A4 → SO(3), π−1(i(A4)) is a Schur covering group of A4.
Lemma 3.17. Let G be a ﬁnite group such that A4 ⊂ G. Let π : SU(2) → SO(3) be the
canonical homomorphism. Let φ : G → SO(3) be a injective homomorphism. Then the
kernel of φ is contained both in the center and the derived subgroup of π−1(G).

Proof. Note that ker(π) = {Id,−Id} ⊂ SU(2) which is the center of SU(2). So ker(π)
is contained in the center of π−1(φ(G)). Since A4 ⊂ G, π−1(φ(A4)) ⊂ π−1(φ(G)). Note
that π−1(φ(A4)) is a Schur covering group of A4. So ker(π) is contained in the derived
subgroup of π−1(φ(A4)) and is also contained in the derived subgroup of π−1(φ(G)). (cid:3)

Remark 3.18. Let φ be a injective homomorphism from A5 to SO(3). Note that the the
degree of Schur covering group of A5 is 120 which is the same as the degree of the group
π−1(φ(A5)). By the deﬁnition of Schur covering group, π−1(φ(A5)) is the unique Schur
covering group of A5.

4 The vertex operator algebra V A4
L2

Let L = Zα be a positive deﬁnite even lattice of rank one. That is (α, α) = 2k for some
positive integer k. h = L ⊗Z C and ˆhZ the corresponding Heisenberg algebra; the bilinear
form on L or h is denoted h·,·i. Denote by M (1) the associated irreducible module for ˆhZ
such that the canonical central element of ˆhZ acts as 1. Let C [L] be the group algebra of
L with a basis eα for α ∈ L. Let β ∈ h such that hβ, βi = 1. It was proved in References
[4] [26] that there is a linear map

VL → (EndVL)(cid:2)(cid:2)z, z−1(cid:3)(cid:3)

v 7→ Y (v, z) = Xn∈Z

vnz−n−1

(vn ∈ EndVL)

such that VL = (VL, Y, 1, ω) is a simple vertex operator algebra where 1 = 1 ⊗ e0. The
dual lattice L◦ of L is

L◦ = {λ ∈ h| (α, λ) ∈ Z} =

1
2k

L.

i=−k+1 (L + λi) is the coset decomposition with λi = i

Then L◦ = ∪k
2k α. Set VL+λi =
M (1) ⊗ C [L + λi]. Then VL+λi for i = −k + 1, · · · , k are the irreducible modules for VL.
Let θ be an automorphism of ˆL such that θ (α) = −α. We deﬁne an automorphism of VL,
denote again by θ, such that

θ (u ⊗ eα) = θ (u) ⊗ e−α for u ∈ M (1) and α ∈ ˆL.

Here the action of θ on M (1) is given by

θ (β (n1)· · · β (nk)) = (−1)k β (n1) · · · β (nk) .

The θ-invariant V +

Let χs be a character of L/2L such that χs (α) = (−1)s for s = 0, 1 and Tχs = C the
irreducible L/2L-module with character χs. It is well known that V Ts
L = M (1) (θ) ⊗ Tχs
is an irreducible θ-twisted VL-module. By References [26] [24], denote the ±1-eigenspaces

Let L2 be the root lattice of type A1 and A4 the alternating group which is a subgroup of
the automorphism group of lattice vertex operator algebra VL2. Motivated by the classiﬁ-
cation of rational vertex operator algebras with c = 1, V A4
L2 was studied in Reference [11].
The C2-coﬁniteness and rationality of V A4
L2 are obtained, and the irreducible modules are
Zα as (cid:0)V +
classiﬁed. They ﬁrst realize V G
where hβ, βi = 8 and σ is an automorphism
of sl (2, C) of order 3, since V +
Zβ is well understood, by References [1] [3] [2] [22] [23] [21].

Zβ(cid:1)hσi

Let L2 = Zα be the rank one positive-deﬁnite even lattice such that (α, α) = 2 and
VL2 the associated simple rational vertex operator algebra. Then (VL2)1 ∼= sl2 (C) and
(VL2)1 has an orthonormal basis:

√2 (cid:0)eα − e−α(cid:1) .

Let τi ∈ Aut (VL2), i = 1, 2, 3 be such that

Then σ and τi, i = 1, 2, 3, generate a ﬁnite subgroup of Aut (VL2) isomorphic to the alter-

is a normal subgroup of A4 of order 4. Let β = 2α.

Lemma 4.4. By Reference [13], the group SO(3) is the connected compact subgroup of

Theorem 3.2 shows that there are exactly two irreducible gi twisted modules, where

on irreducible modules of V +

come from irreducible σi, for i = 1, 2, twisted V +

Let H=hσi. Then, H ⊆ A4 satisﬁes the assumption in Theorem 3.8. Remark 4.6 shows

L2 . Also,
theorem 3.6 indicates that the twelve irreducible V hσi
L2 modules of type two exhaust ir-
reducible V A4
L2 modules of type two. Thus, Theorems 3.9 and 3.10 show that the twelve
irreducible V hσi
L2 modules of type two are exactly the twelve irreducible V A4

L2 . The same idea will be used to ﬁnd

Proposition 5.8. By Reference [13], let g be an automorphism of VL2 of order T 6= 1.
Then there exists some vector u ∈ (VL2)1, such that g = e2πiu(0).
The action of {e2πih(0)|h ∈ (VL2)1} on VL2 is isomorphic to SO(3), and on VZ α
is isomorphic
to SU(2). The action of the group generated by {σ, τ1, τ2, τ3, ρ} on VL2 is isomorphic to
S4. Proposition 5.8 shows that hσ, τ1, τ2, τ3, ρi is a subgroup of {e2πih(0)|h ∈ (VL2)1}. So,
hσ, τ1, τ2, τ3, ρi acts on VZ α

that CD3(ρ) = hρi, and hρi ⊂ GM . The fact GM ⊂ CD3(ρ) shows that hρi = GM . Theo-

Remark 5.19. Actions of ω on the ﬁrst level of a module show that those ten irreducible

6 Irreducible modules of V A5

Let β = 2α, γ = 3α, and µ = 5α.

Remark 6.1. A collection of properties of the alternating group A5 are given.

• (a) A5 is simple.
• (b)Subgroups of A5 of a ﬁxed order has a unique conjugacy class.
• (c)The maximal proper subgroups of A5 are isomorphic to S3, D5, and A4.
• (d)The Sylow 2 group is isomorphic to the Klein four group K. The Sylow 3 group
is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z3. The Sylow 5 group is isomorphic to the cyclic
group Z5.

• (e)The projective special linear group of degree two for A is P SL(2, 5). The corre-

sponding Schur cover is SL(2, 5).

Remark 6.2. Denote the corresponding groups in A by V4, Z/3Z, Z/5Z, twisted S3, D5,
and A4. Use CG(H) and NG(H) to denote centralizer and normalizer respectively. Then,

CA5(V4) = V4, CA5(Z/3Z) = Z/3Z, CA5(Z/5Z) = Z/5Z,

and

NA5(V4) = A4, NA5(Z/3Z) = S3, NA5(Z/5Z) = D5,

Remark 6.3. There are two irreducible VL2 modules, VL2 and VL2+ α
the ﬁrst level of VL2 is 0, and on VL2+ α
and VL2+ α
that there are two types of irreducible V J

Consider H = Z/3Z. Then, NA5(H) = S3. Theorem 4.1 shows that those twelve ir-
reducible V Z/3Z
L2 modules of type two in Remark 6.1 become six nonisomorphic irreducible
V S3
L2 modules, VZγ± r
18 γ, for r ∈ Z, 1 ≤ r ≤ 8, and r 6= 0(mod3). Lemma 6.5 shows that
those six modules are irreducible V A5
L2 modules. The action of ω on the ﬁrst levels of these
six modules are distinct. Thus, they are nonisomorphic irreducible V A5

L2 modules.

Consider H = Z/5Z. Then, NA5(H) = D5. Theorem 4.1 shows that those forty irre-
ducible V Z/5Z
L2 modules of type two in Remark 6.1 become twenty nonisomorphic irre-
ducible V D5
50 µ, for t ∈ Z, 1 ≤ t ≤ 24, and r 6= 0 (mod 5). Lemma 6.5
L2 modules, VZµ± t
shows that those twenty modules are irreducible V A5
L2 modules. The action of ω on the
ﬁrst levels of these twenty modules are distinct. Thus, they are nonisomorphic irreducible
V A5
L2 modules. (cid:3)

Proof. The desired result follows from Lemma 6.5, Lemma 6.6, Theorem 3.12, and Remark
6.1. (cid:3)
Proposition 5.8 shows that A5 can be considered as a subgroup of {e2πih(0)|h ∈ (VL2)1}.
Thus, A5 acts on VZ α
Zα]. Remark 3.18 shows that the action of the group
A5 on VZ α
is a Schur cover of A4, which is isomorphic to SL(2, 5), the general linear group
of degree 2 over a ﬁeld of three elements. Thus, by the quantum Galois theory [19]

, where χ runs over all irreducible characters of SL(2, 5). The irreducible representa-
tions of the group SL(2, 5) are well known, one 1-dimensional, two 2-dimensional, two
3-dimensional, two 4-dimensional, one 5-dimensional, and one 6-dimensional irreducible
representations. Denote them by X1, X i

The subindex is the dimension of the module and the upper indices distinguish the irre-
ducible modules of the same dimension.
Remark 6.8. Irreducible V A5
L2 modules of type one occurs and exhausts the modules in
the complete decomposition in Equation 6.1. By quantum Galois Theory, express these
modules as T1, T i

the quantum dimension of the module and the upper indices distinguish the irreducible

Proof. The quantum dimensions listed are obtained by Remark 6.8, Theorem 3.9, and
Theorem 3.10. (cid:3)

Remark 6.11. These classiﬁcation of V A5
is based on the C2 coﬁniteness and on the
L2
rationality of V A5
L2 . However, Theorem 3.8 requires the rationality of V H rather than the
rationality of V G. For any proper subset H of A5, notice that V H is rational. Therefore,
even if V A5
L2 was not rational, the irreducible modules listed in this paper would still be
correct irreducible modules, but might not exhaust all of them.
