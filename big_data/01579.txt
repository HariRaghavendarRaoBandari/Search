To Grow is Not Enough: Impact of Noise on Cell Environmental Response and Fitness

Quantitative single cell measurements have shown that cell cycle duration (the time between cell
divisions) for diverse cell types is a noisy variable. The underlying distribution is mean scalable
with a universal shape for many cell types in a variety of environments. Here we show through
both experiment and theory that increasing the amount of noise in the regulation of the cell cycle
negatively impacts the growth rate but positively correlates with improved cellular response to
ﬂuctuating environments. Our ﬁndings suggest that even non-cooperative cells in exponential growth
phase do not optimize ﬁtness through growth rate alone, but also optimize adaptability to changing
conditions. In a manner similar to genetic evolution, increasing the noise in biochemical processes
correlates with improved response of the system to environmental changes.

The mantra,“Survival of the Fittest,” coined by
Spencer and popularized by Darwin himself [1], pervades
every corner of biology. Fitness is usually deﬁned to
be the“birth-rate” or the rate at which new individu-
als are added to the population. Cooperative and mut-
licellular systems may require a more complicated def-
inition; but often even these phenomena are shown to
derive from the maximization of total sustainable single-
cell number [2–5]. In the case of non-cooperative, single-
cell species (e.g. bacteria at low cell density), ﬁtness as
birth-rate is accepted. For such a population during ex-
ponential growth, the number of cells in an ensemble can
be well described as a function of time if we know the
initial number N0, and the cell cycle duration τ , yield-
ing N (t) = N0 exp(ln(2)t/τ ). In this way the constant
r = ln(2)/τ , often labeled the“growth-rate”, is used to
measure ﬁtness - the larger r and the faster an organism
grows, the ﬁtter it is.

However, the growth rate for a single cell is often
hard to deﬁne. Experiments conducted in constant en-
vironments maintained in microﬂuidic devices (so called
“Mother Machines”) show that the cell cycle duration
[6] is stochastic and exhibits large variations for both
prokaryotes and eukaryotes [7]. Thus one should consider
a statistical distribution of cell cycle durations P (τ ),
where τ is the time between 2 successive cell divisions
(septum formations). Owing to the fact that synthesis of
new proteins and replication of DNA require ﬁnite time,
there is a physical lower limit for the cell cycle dura-
tion, τ∗ (dependent on the environment), below which
no cells can divide. From an evolutionary perspective,
we quickly see that to optimize fast growth, P (τ ) should
be a narrow distribution centered as close to τ∗ as possi-
ble; however, the measured distribution for E. coli stands
in stark opposition to this idea [6, 7] (Fig. 1), exhibit-
ing a signiﬁcant variance in τ . Quite strikingly, P (τ ) is
mean scaleable [8, 9] across a wide variety of conditions,
with shape conservation spanning cell types from E. coli
to human dermal ﬁbroblast cells [7]. In Fig. 1 we dis-
play the distributions and corresponding statistics for the
ensembles investigated in this work and verify that they

reﬂect the features discussed here.

These observations,

in conjunction with established
cell cycle models [10, 11] and more recent experimen-
tal results for protein synthesis and volume regulation,
have given rise to the present discussion about whether
a cell is best described as regulating its time until divi-
sion, a“timer” mechanism; volume at division, a“sizer”
mechanism; or mass added over a single generation, a
“constant adder” mechanism [12–14].

Nevertheless, stochasticity in the cell cycle dynam-
ics and heterogeneity in cell growth rate seems univer-
sal, which begs the question “Why is this important?”
Speciﬁcally, we wish to probe the role of programmed
non-genetic heterogeneity apparent in this trend: that
slow growing cultures exhibit greater variability in their
cell cycle regulation. The question we will focus on for
this investigation is, “does increasing the noise in the
mechanisms regulating the cell cycle correlate with im-
proved cell ﬁtness?”

We ﬁrst sought to determine how the variance of the

Thus, the population growth-rate is not improved by
increasing the noise in the cell cycle duration distribution
and from the usual deﬁnition of ﬁtness, this would sug-
gest cells should narrow this distribution. If this noise is
intrinsic to underlying molecular mechanisms; however,
and stochasticity is prevalent in gene expression [19, 20],
polymerase activity [21], and chemotaxis [22, 23], cells
might require higher energy consumption (sacriﬁcing en-
ergy eﬃciency which carries its own evolutionary impor-
tance [24]), or an increase of τ∗ (increasing mean du-
ration) to minimize noise. Here we suggest that there
is another role (beneﬁt) for the observed programmed
non-genetic heterogeneity beyond the diﬃculty associ-
ated with noise reduction.

Organismal survival depends on two broad qualities -
stability and adaptability. Stability is a measure of short-
term ﬁtness, how precisely a system can maintain condi-
tions optimized for a constant environment. Adaptability
is a measure of long-term ﬁtness, how quickly a system is
able to achieve optimized conditions when introduced to
a new environment. In the context of genetic evolution,
a more mutable genome oﬀers an organism less stability
but improved adaptability over many generations both
through simply allowing for greater genetic diversity at
any given time [25, 26] and high mutation rates [27, 28]
Here we demonstrate that the case is similar for the non-
genetic noise between mother and daughter cells on a
much shorter timescale.

To see how heterogeneity correlates with adaptation
to environmental changes, we grew E. coli in the Mother
Machine and collected single cell cycle duration data. We
grew cells in ﬁve diﬀerent types of media, performed step
changes in the growth medium, and measured how cells
responded to these sudden environmental changes. Fig.
3 shows how the CCDDs evolved over time. For each
experiment, the distribution is initially constant and sta-
ble before the sudden environmental change. After the
change, the distribution shifted over time, and eventually
reached the new stable distribution for the new environ-
ment. We ﬁnd that the cell cycle duration trajectories
for individual cells follow a similar trend but include sig-
niﬁcant noise (Fig. 3 insets).

We observed the response of CCDDs ρ(τ, n) in a series
of step change experiments where for time t < 0 cells
were exposed to a constant environment, and at t = 0
the environment was altered in such a way that the new
mean cell cycle duration was measurably diﬀerent. (See
SM section III). The results are for E. coli in a Mother
Machine, but we also conducted a series of bulk temper-
ature shift experiments to compare with the microﬂuidic
results (See SM Section V). Fig. 3 shows the results of the
eight environmental shift experiments conducted. The
top row contains relaxation experiments where the cells
were grown in suboptimal conditions including one nu-
trient limited and three hypertonic solutions (where the
osmolarity was increased with the addition of Sorbitol)

cell cycle duration distribution (CCDD) correlates with
the mean ensemble growth rate. The duration distri-
bution is best described as a shifted gamma distribution:
Γ(K)θK (τ − τ∗)K−1 e− τ
θ , where θ and K are parameters.
The mean growth rate r of the population is obtained by
solving τ∗r + Kln (1 + r/θ) = ln 2 [7]. P (τ ) is bounded
on the left due to the ﬁnite time required to construct a
new cell as discussed above. Given this minimum time τ∗,
one may calculate the maximum growth rate for a given
variance (cid:104)δτ 2(cid:105) by changing parameters (K, θ). In Fig. 2,
we set τ∗ to be length of the shortest observed cell cycle
and numerically calculated the maximum growth rate for
variances ranging over experimentally observed values.
Over this range, the maximum growth rate diminished
by a factor of three as we increased (cid:104)δτ 2(cid:105). Clearly, in-
creased noise in the regulation of the cell cycle correlates
with a lower growth rate.
It is also important to note
that cell division dynamics in E. coli appears to be er-
godic: each individual mother cell explores the entire dis-
tribution and if data from a single cell is collected over a
long period of time, the resultant distribution appears to
match that of a collection of many cells at a single time,
shown in Fig. 2. This suggests that there are no “persis-
tor cells” that grow very slowly at all times to beneﬁt the
collective culture when subjected to harsh environments.
More generally, it can be shown that given any CCDD
with ﬁnite width, there exists a narrower one which at-
tains the same growth-rate or greater (SM section I). We
note that the existence of “persistor cells” has been con-
ﬁrmed [15–18] in specialized cases and that these cells
play an important role in culture survivability. From our
analysis of division phenotypes in the mother machine,
however, they do not contribute signiﬁcantly to the mea-
sured CCDD.

before shifting the media to the optimal environment (in
diluted LB medium) for fast growth. The bottom row
are the reverse, stress experiments. The model is able
to predict the time course of cell response, including the
overshoots observed in severe stress conditions (Fig. 3)

The trend across the top row in Fig. 3 is clear: as
the magnitude of the shift increases (left to right), the
response speed (change in the mean divided by the time
over which the change occurred) increases as well. A
complementary trend may be observed on the bottom
row: as the severity of the stress increases (left to right),
the response speed also increases. (See Fig. 4A). How-
ever, while for the relaxation experiments (top row) re-
sponse speed directly correlates with adaptability, for the
stress experiments (bottom row) this is not the case. We
consider an adaptable cell to be one which responds “eﬃ-
ciently” to environmental changes in terms of its growth
rate alone.
(Here we observe negligible ﬁlamentation
rates and cellular aging is not an issue as cells were only
followed for fewer than ﬁfty generations.) In other words,
its growth rate is as high as possible for as long as possi-
ble. In the case of the relaxation experiments (top row),
the faster the response speed, the greater the adaptability
as a greater response speed allows the cell to spend more
time in a fast growth state. For the stress experiments
(bottom row) the reverse is true: the greater the response
speed, the less time the cell is able to remain in the fast
growing state. In fact, we have observed that for severe
environmental stresses, cells respond so ineﬃciently that
they attain a growth rate during the period of response
which is even lower than that of the ﬁnal stable growth
rate (e.g. Fig. 3 last panel). Thus, to compare the ef-
ﬁciency of response across all experiments, we proposed

to use a new quantity, ∆,

is the minimum period for all eight ex-
periments to complete the response to their new en-
vironments, and the average (cid:104)(cid:105) is taken over all cells.
(Note that the trends observed are maintained over a
wide range of λ. See SM section IV.) µi,f is the steady
state average cell cycle duration before and after the step
change, respectively. When ∆ is large and positive, the
cells respond so ineﬃciently that during response they
grow even slower than in the stressed condition. When
∆ is large and negative, the cells are able to remain or
enter in the fast growth state for the majority of the re-
sponse period. We analyze these results in the context of
a phenomenological model introduced below.

We consider a sequence of cell cycles (τ1, τ2, . . . ) and
the evolution of the cell cycle distribution over genera-
tions, ρ(τ, n) where n is the index of generation. For a
constant environment at long times, cells are at steady
state in the Mother Machine, and ρ(τ, n) ≡ P (τ ) shown
in Fig. 1. For a changing environment, we consider a
Markovian stochastic model for ρ(τ, n), which describes
the evolution of this distribution from one generation to
the next as

(cid:90)

ρ(τi, n + 1) =

dτjM (τj → τi; φ)ρ(τj, n)

(2)

where M is the transition probability, which depends on
the current environment described by φ. M describes the
probability of a daughter cell to divide after duration τi
given that the mother cell divided after duration τj. Eq.

by developing a model for M , we can predict how cells
can respond to environmental changes over time.

Motivated by these ideas in conjunction with the
“constant-adder model” and older foundational work
[29], we propose an approximate Gaussian model for the
cell cycle dynamics:

where σ1, σ2 are positive constants describing the noise,
and µ is the mean cell cycle duration for a given condition
φ. σ1, σ2 and µ all depend on the current environmental
variable φ. α is a constant between 0 and 1, representing
the fraction of the cell cycle after DNA replication has
terminated and before septum formation. See SM sec-
tion II. The ﬁrst term represents adaptability - increasing
its weight (decreasing σ1) is equivalent to boosting the
amount of information a cell may obtain about its envi-
ronment. Conversely, the second term represents stabil-
ity and increasing its weight (decreasing σ2) is equivalent
to increasing the similarity between mother and daughter
cells. When the environment is constant, dynamics gen-
erated by M must produce the steady state CCDD, P (τ ).
Therefore, (σ1, σ2, µ) are determined by the environment
and their corresponding steady state distributions.
In-
deed, for constant environmental conditions, the model
predicts that the correlation of cell cycle duration is,

Since (σ1, σ2) depend on environmental conditions, this
result is a way to use steady state cell cycle correlations to
obtain M . In addition, it is possible to explicitly obtain
transition probabilities from the experimental data. The
comparison between our model M and the data collected
is shown in Fig. S1. (see SM section IV)

Unlike the response speed which increases with increas-
ing environmental shock severity over all experiments,
we ﬁnd that ∆ for the shock and relaxation experiments
display two opposing trends: as the severity of the en-
vironmental change, measured as |µi − µf| increases, ∆
decreases for the relaxation experiments and increases
for the stress experiments (See Fig. 4B). Clearly the
response eﬃciency cannot be predicted from the sever-
ity of the environmental change alone. According to our
model, there is a parameter that should be well corre-
lated with response eﬃciency, σ2. As σ2 (calculated from
the initial state) increases, the similarity between mother
and daughter cells decreases - which should make the
cell more adaptable. We ﬁnd that this agrees with ex-
periment: as σ2 increases, ∆ decreases (Fig. 4C). σ2 is
not the ideal parameter for comparison, however, since

it cannot be directly measured experimentally. It would
be better if the same trend could be observed for the to-
tal variance, (cid:104)δτ 2(cid:105), of the cycle duration distribution.
Here we may utilize a result from the constant-adder
model, which predicts that the autocorrelation function is
conserved across diﬀerent environmental conditions [12].
Given the autocorrelation function we can derive σ2 with
the variance of the ensemble. As the variance increases,
σ2 increases (Fig. 4D). Thus knowing that σ2 must be
large for an eﬃcient response, then the variance must
also be large for an eﬃcient response. We ﬁnd that this
well agrees with experiment: as the variance of the initial
CCDD increases, ∆ decreases (Fig. 4E).

We may now return to answer our original ques-
tion,“does increasing the noise in the mechanisms reg-
ulating the cell cycle correlate with improved cell ﬁt-
ness?” The answer appears to be yes:
Increasing the
variance of the CCDD, attributable to increasing non-
genetic heterogeneity of the culture, correlates with im-
proved adaptability of the cell to environmental changes.
This is because with increased noise, cells can explore
a wider range of phenotypes and some are already well
suited for a new environment before it is introduced. In
other stochastic systems, the ﬂuctuation dissipation the-
orem (FDT) expresses a similar concept. However, we
have not proved this connection conclusively, since in E.
coli, (cid:104)δτ 2(cid:105) is also inversely correlated with the mean di-
vision time. One could also argue that a slower dividing
cell responds eﬃciently. The conclusive proof requires
comparison between strains that divide with the same
mean, but diﬀerent (cid:104)δτ 2(cid:105). Such a construct is currently
not available to us.

sion [30] has proven to be important for cellular robust-
ness [31] and displayed clinical relevance: increasing the
stochasticity of protein expression can help combat dor-
mant pathogens such as HIV [32]. Here we showed that
these short term ﬂuctuations in the biochemical regula-
tion of the cell cycle are correlated with the ability of
a cell to adapt to a changing environment, analogous
to the long term genetic adaptations[33] and comple-
mentary to long term memory of a periodic, ﬂucuting
environment[34, 35]. Our results here provide a reason
for the mean-scaling (or ﬁxed CV) of CCDDs and their
universal shape: when growing fast, cells beneﬁt most
from stability where a greater gain may be achieved from
optimizing growth for the current and immediate envi-
ronment; however when growing slowly, cells beneﬁt more
from improving their adaptability so that when superior
growth conditions are presented they may respond eﬃ-
ciently to best utilize the new environmental conditions.
When the mean cell cycle duration is large, it most bene-
ﬁts the population to be heterogeneous. When the mean
is small it is best for the population to be homogenous.
