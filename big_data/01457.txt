Abstract

In this work, we analyze the eﬀects of thermal ﬂuctuations on the thermodynamics
of a modiﬁed Hayward black hole. These thermal ﬂuctuations will produce correction
terms for various thermodynamic quantities like entropy, pressure, inner energy and
speciﬁc heats. We also investigate the eﬀect of these correction terms on the ﬁrst law
of thermodynamics. Finally, we study the phase transition for the modiﬁed Hayward
black hole. It is demonstrated that the modiﬁed Hayward black hole is stable even
after the thermal ﬂuctuations are taken into account, as long as the event horizon is
larger than a certain critical value.

Keywords: Black hole; Thermodynamics.

Introduction

The black hole entropy obtained by famous formula S = A/4, where A denotes the area of
the event horizon [1]. This is the maximum entropy contained by any object of the same
volume [2, 3]. It may be noted that a maximum entropy has to be associated with the black
holes to prevent the violation of the second law of thermodynamics [4, 5]. The reason is that,
if a black hole did not have any entropy, then the entropy of the universe would spontaneous
reduce when any object crosses the horizon. The observation that the entropy of a black
hole scales with its area has led to the development of the holographic principle [6, 7]. This

principle equates the degrees of freedom in a region of space with the degrees of freedom on
the boundary of that region.

Even though the holographic principle is expected to hold for large regions of space, it
is expected to get violated near the Planck scale [8, 9]. This violation of the holographic
principle occurs due to the quantum ﬂuctuations in the geometry of space-time. As these
quantum ﬂuctuations are expected to dominate the geometry of space-time near the Planck
scale, it is expected that the holographic principle will be violated near the Planck scale.
Thus, the relation between the area and entropy of a black hole is also expected to get
modiﬁed near the Planck scale. In fact, the quantum ﬂuctuations in the geometry of the
black hole will lead to the thermal ﬂuctuations in the black hole thermodynamics [10, 11].
It will be possible to neglect these thermal ﬂuctuations for the large black holes. However,
as the black holes reduce in size due to the radiation of the Hawking radiation, the quantum
ﬂuctuations in the geometry of the black hole will increase. Thus, the thermal ﬂuctuations
will start to modify the thermodynamics of the black holes as the black holes reduce in size.
It is possible to calculate the correction terms generated from such thermal ﬂuctuations.
The correction terms generated from these thermal ﬂuctuations are logarithmic functions of
the original thermodynamic quantities.

The corrections to the black hole thermodynamics have been obtained using the density
of microstates for asymptotically ﬂat black holes [12]. This was done by using a formalism
called the non-perturbative quantum general relativity.
In this formalism, the density of
states for a black hole was associated with the conformal blocks of a well deﬁned confor-
mal ﬁeld theory. It was demonstrated that even though the leading order relation between
the entropy and area of a black hole is the standard Bekenstein entropy-area relation, this
formalism also generated logarithmic corrections terms to the standard Bekenstein entropy-
area relation. It has also been demonstrated using the Cardy formula that the logarithmic
correction terms are generated for all black holes whose microscopic degrees of freedom are
described by a conformal ﬁeld theory [13]. Matter ﬁelds have been studied in the presence
of a black hole, and this analysis has also generated logarithmic correction terms for the
Bekenstein entropy-area formula [14, 15, 16]. The logarithmic correction terms are also gen-
erated from string theoretical eﬀects [17, 18, 19, 20]. The corrections term for the entropy
of a dilatonic black holes has been calculated [21]. It was found that this correction term
is again a logarithmic functions of the original thermodynamic quantities. Such correction
terms have also been generated using a Rademacher expansion of the partition function [22].
So, it seems that such logarithmic corrections terms occur almost universally.

The singularity at the center of black holes indicates a breakdown of general theory of
relativity, as it cannot be gauged away by coordinate transformations. However, it is possible
to construct black holes which are regular and do not contain an singularity at the center.
The Hayward black hole is an example of such regular black hole as it does not contain
a singularity at the center [23, 24]. These black holes have been analyzed using various
modiﬁcations of the Chaplygin gas formalism [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. The motion of a

2

particle in background of a Hayward black hole also has been discussed [32]. The massive
scalar quasinormal modes of the Hayward black hole have been studied [33]. In fact, the
one-loop quantum corrections to the Newton potential for these regular black holes has been
calculated in [34]. Recently, the accretion of ﬂuid ﬂow around the modiﬁed Hayward black
hole have been analyzed [35]. The acceleration of particles in presence of a rotating modiﬁed
Hayward black hole has also been investigated [36]. In this paper, we will analyze the eﬀects
of thermal ﬂuctuations on thermodynamics of a modiﬁed Hayward black hole.

2 Modiﬁed Hayward Black Hole

The most general spherically symmetric, static line element describing modiﬁed Hayward
black hole can be written as [34, 35],

ds2 = −f (r)B(r)dt2 +

dr2
B(r)

+ r2dΩ2,

dΩ2 = dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2,

where

where M is the black hole mass, l is the Hubble length which is related to the cosmological
constant, α is a positive constants and β is related with the cosmological constant [37]. In
the Ref. [35] it is found that α > 1. We will ﬁnd lower bounds for both α and β using the
thermodynamics description.
The horizon radius of the black hole can be found by the real positive root of the following
equation,

So, one can obtain the black hole mass in terms of the horizon radius as follows,

which implies that r2

For the special case of M = 3√3
r+ = 2M = 3√3

An important thermodynamic quantity is the entropy which is related to the black hole
horizon area,

Also, volume of the black hole is given by,

where the black hole mass M is given by the equation (5) and black hole horizon radius
is given by the equation (6). Therefore, we can investigate thermodynamics of black hole
in terms of either black hole mass or radius associated with the event horizon. Now, the
temperature of the black hole can be simpliﬁed to the another form,

+ − 2α + β
There are two conditions to have real positive temperature,

Both conditions satisﬁed simultaneously if we have,

.

(13)

(14)

It shows that α > 1 is necessary to have positive β, as illustrated by Ref.
If we
assume integer values for α and β, quickly we ﬁnd β ≥ 8. Therefore, α = 2 and β = 8 are
corresponding to the zero-temperature limit, and both conditions of (13) are the same. The
case of β = 0 yields to ordinary Hayward black hole [23] with the temperature given by,

[35].

The pressure can be obtained by

It is interesting to investigate the ﬁrst law of thermodynamic [38, 39],

dM = T dS + V dP + ...,

other terms are corresponding to the black hole rotation and charge which are absent in
our model. It is easy to check that the equation (17) violates. In order for thermodynamic
quantities satisfy above relation, we have two solutions: the ﬁrst is to add rotation or charge
to the black hole, the second is consideration of logarithmic correction.

3 Logarithmic correction

It is possible to calculate the eﬀect of thermal ﬂuctuations on the thermodynamics of modiﬁed
Hayward black hole. One can write the partition function of the system as

Z =Z DgDAe−I,

(18)

where I → −iI is the Euclidean action for this system [40]. It is possible to relate it to the
partition function in the statistical mechanical as

Z =Z ∞

0

dE ρ(E)e−βκE,

(19)

where βκ is the inverse of the temperature. The partition function can be used to calculate
the density of states

ρ(E) =

1

2πiZ β0κ+i∞

β0κ−i∞

dβκ eS(βκ),

where

S = βκE + ln Z.

(20)

(21)

The entropy around the equilibrium temperature β0κ can be obtained by neglecting all the
thermal ﬂuctuations. However, if thermal ﬂuctuations are taken into account, then S(βκ),
can be written as

S = S0 +

1
2

(βκ − β0κ)2(cid:18)∂2S(βκ)

κ (cid:19)βκ=β0κ

∂β2

.

So, the density of states can be written as

ρ(E) =

eS0

2πiZ β0κ+i∞

β0κ−i∞

dβκ exp  1

2

(βκ − β0κ)2(cid:18) ∂2S(βκ)

κ (cid:19)βκ=β0κ! .

Thus, we obtain

So, we can write

S = S0 −

.

.

(24)

(25)

This expression can be simpliﬁed using the relation between the microscopic degrees of
freedom of a black hole and a conformal ﬁeld theory. This is because using this relation,
the entropy can be assumed to the form, S = a1βm
κ , where a1, a2, m, n are positive
constants [13]. This has an extremum at β0κ = (na2/ma1)1/m+n = T −1 and so we can expand
the entropy around this extremum

κ + a2β−n

S(βκ) = [(n/m)m/(m+n) + (m/n)n/(m+n)](an

2 )1/(m+n)

)1/(m+n)

1 am−2

2

+
2
×(βκ − β0κ)2,

Now we can write

S0 = (n/m)m/(m+n) + (m/n)n/(m+n)(an

2 )1/(m+n),

(cid:18)∂2S(βκ)

κ (cid:19)βκ=β0κ

∂β2

= (m + n)m(n+2)/(m+n)n(m−2)/(m+n)

×(an+2

1 am−2

2

)1/(m+n)

.

It is possible to solve for a1, a2 and express the entropy as

(cid:18)∂2S(βκ)

κ (cid:19)βκ=β0κ

∂β2

= YS0T 2 ,

where

Y = (cid:20)(cid:18)(m + n)m(n+2)/(m+n)n(m−2)/(m+n)
(n/m)m/(m+n) + (m/n)n/(m+n) (cid:19)
m(cid:17)2/(m+n)(cid:21) .
×(cid:16) n

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

However, the factor Y can be absorbed using some redeﬁnition as it does not depend on the
black hole parameters [10, 11]. Thus, we can write

= S0β−2
0κ .

(30)

(cid:18)∂2S(βκ)

κ (cid:19)βκ=β0κ

∂β2

So, the corrected value of the entropy can be written as

We can write a general expression for the entropy as

S = S0 −

1
2

ln S0T 2,

S = S0 −

b
2

ln S0T 2,

(31)

(32)

where we introduced a parameter b by hand to track corrected terms, so in the limit b → 0,
the original results can be recovered and b = 1 yields usual corrections [11]. By using the
temperature and entropy given by the equations (11) and (9) respectively, we can obtain the
following corrected entropy,

S = πr2

b

ln(cid:20) (r2

+ − 3)2(2αr2
+(2αr2

16πr4

+ − αβ − 2α + β)
+ − 2α + β)

(cid:21) .

(33)

It is clear that the logarithmic correction reduce the entropy of the black hole. We can obtain
the entropy at zero-temperature using appropriate choice of α and β (α = 2 and β = 8),

S(T = 0) = πr2

+ −

b
2

lns (r2

16πr4

+ − 3)3
+(r2

+ + 1)

.

(34)

As we mentioned already, both zero-temperature conditions (13) are the same for α = 2
and β = 8. So, r+ = √3 is zero-temperature condition where entropy (34) become inﬁnite.
The fact is that at the zero-temperature limit, thermal ﬂuctuations vanish and we should
set b = 0.
It is clear from the equation (32), so at the zero-temperature limit we have
S(T = 0) = 3π.
We can calculate pressure using the (9), (10), (11) and following relation,

P = T (cid:18) ∂S
∂V (cid:19)V

.

(35)

In the Fig. 1, we can analyze the behavior of pressure for various values of parameters.
Comparing dashed line and dotted line, we can ﬁnd that the logarithmic correction decrease
the pressure. Using the higher values for the black hole mass from the relation (8), we ﬁnd
zero pressure around the black hole horizon. Higher values of the mass yields to negative
pressure. For all cases with M < 3√3
4 , we can see positive pressure, which yields to zero as
M → 0, it is clearly expected that vanished black hole has no thermodynamics pressure.

Then, using the well known relation,

we can obtain inner energy which decreased dramatically due to the logarithmic corrections.
It may be noted that T and S can be used to obtain the speciﬁc heat at constant volume,

E =Z T dS,

(36)

Cv =(cid:18)T

∂S

∂T(cid:19)V

.

(37)

Figure 1: Pressure versus horizon radius with α = 2. b = 1, β = 10 (dashed line); b = 1,
β = 0 (solid line); b = 0, β = 10 (dotted line); b = 1, β = 8 (dash dotted line).

Calculation of P and E help us to obtain speciﬁc heat at constant pressure,

Cp =(cid:18)∂(E + P V )

∂T

(cid:19)P

.

(38)

So, we can investigate γ = Cp/Cv numerically. From the Fig. 2 it is illustrated that, for the
large horizon radius, γ → 0.5. We ﬁnd that the value of γ increased due to the logarithmic
corrected entropy.
Now, in order to investigate the ﬁrst law of thermodynamic we rewrite the equation (17)

as follow,

X = Y,

(39)
where X ≡ dM − T dS and Y ≡ V dP . Then, we give plots of X and Y in terms of the radius
of a black hole horizon in Fig. 3. We draw three curves corresponding to each X(α, β) and
Y (α, β). We see that, at least, there are two points where the ﬁrst law of thermodynamic is
satisﬁed. Cross points of the red (solid) and blue (dashed) curves states X = Y which means
validity of the relation (17). Therefore, we can say that, the ﬁrst law of thermodynamic may
also valid for the modiﬁed Hayward black hole. There are some special cases with suitable
horizon radius where the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is satisﬁed.

4 Phase transition

One of the best ways to ﬁnd instability of a black hole is studied the sign of the speciﬁc heat
given by the equation (37). The black hole is stable for Cv > 0, while is unstable for Cv < 0.
Therefore, Cv = 0 show the point of phase transition. It is easy to write the speciﬁc heat at
constant volume as follow,

Cv =

A2 = 4πα(2β − 10α − αβ),

We give graphical analysis of the speciﬁc heat which illustrated in Fig. 4. We can

demonstrate that various cases of the black hole may be stable for the case of r+ ≥
It is clear that the modiﬁed Hayward black hole with logarithmic correction of entropy is
stable for r+ ≥ 1.9. Therefore, we can say that the modiﬁed Hayward black hole is stable for
r+ ≥ rc, where rc is critical value (minimum value) for the radius of the event horizon. It may
be related to the minimum mass required for the formation of the Hayward black hole [41].

5 Conclusions

In this work, we have studied the spherically symmetric, static modiﬁed Hayward black hole.
The entropy, temperature and pressure have been calculated and found some restrictions on
the parameters α and β. Next, we have analyzed the eﬀects of thermal ﬂuctuations on the
thermodynamics of a Hayward black hole. Using the zero-temperature limit of the black
hole, we have obtained the bounds α ≥ 2 and β ≥ 8. Here, the equality holds only in the
zero-temperature limit. We have also analyzed the logarithmic correction to entropy and
obtained the behaviors of the pressure and speciﬁc heats numerically. We found that the
value of the pressure and inner energy reduced due to these logarithmic corrections. We also
studied phase transition for the modiﬁed Hayward black hole, and obtained critical point
for such a phase transition. We also demonstrated that the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics
is satisﬁed for the modiﬁed Hayward black hole, even in presence of thermal ﬂuctuations.
It may be noted that the thermodynamics of black holes also gets modiﬁed because of the
generalized uncertainty principle [42, 43]. Such correction terms are non-trivial, and can lead

11

to interesting consequences like the existence of black hole remnants. It would be interesting
to analyze the corrections to the thermodynamics of a regular Hayward black hole from the
generalized uncertainty principle.
