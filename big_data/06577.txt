ABSTRACT

Pulsar timing arrays are now setting increasingly tight limits on the gravitational wave background from
binary supermassive black holes. But as upper limits grow more constraining, what can be implied about
galaxy evolution? We investigate which astrophysical parameters have the largest impact on strain spectrum
predictions and provide a simple framework to directly translate between measured values for the parame-
ters of galaxy evolution and PTA limits on the gravitational wave background of binary supermassive black
holes. We ﬁnd that the most inﬂuential observable is the relation between a host galaxy’s central bulge and
its central black hole, M•-Mbulge, which has the largest effect on the mean value of the characteristic strain
amplitude. However, the variance of each prediction is dominated by uncertainties in the galaxy stellar mass
function. Using this framework with the best published PTA limit, we can set limits on the shape and scatter
of the M•-Mbulge relation. We ﬁnd our limits to be in contention with strain predictions using two leading
measurements of this relation. We investigate several possible reasons for this disagreement. If we take the
M•-Mbulge relations to be correct within a simple power-law model for the gravitational wave background,
then the inconsistency is reconcilable by allowing for an additional “stalling” time between a galaxy merger
and evolution of a binary supermassive black hole to sub-parsec scales, with lower limits on this timescale of
∼ 1 − 2 Gyr.

1. INTRODUCTION

Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are beginning to place mean-
ingful constraints on the gravitational wave background
(GWB) in the nanoHz-µHz gravitational wave band. In par-
ticular, recent upper limits have cut into the range of predicted
strengths of the GWB from supermassive black hole (SMBH)
binaries (Lentati et al. 2015; Arzoumanian et al. 2015; Shan-
non et al. 2015).

The characteristic strain spectrum of the GWB, hc(f ), is
the quadrature sum of individual sources emitting in a cer-
tain GW frequency band. The ﬁrst predictions of the GWB
signal in the PTA band were made primarily using semi-
analytical dark matter halo simulations (e. g. Jaffe & Backer
2003; Wyithe & Loeb 2003). These have been updated with
full cosmological simulations (i.e.
the Millennium simula-
tion (Sesana et al. 2009; Ravi et al. 2012)). In recent years
it has been recognized that the dominant source of emis-
sion in the PTA band may come from the z (cid:46) 2 binary
population (Sesana et al. 2008) and efforts to predict hc(f )
have been based on various combinations of simulated and
observed components of cosmological galaxy evolution. In
fact, a number of the parameters that make up the astrophys-
ical GWB are well-constrained by observation. Thus, the
focus has turned toward modeling the GWB based on local
observables (Sesana 2013b; McWilliams et al. 2014; Ravi
et al. 2015). Current work attempts to understand the ef-
fects that both under-efﬁcient inspiral (binary “stalling”) and
super-efﬁcient inspiral (i. e. binary coupling with the galaxy
core environment through the PTA band) might have on hc(f )
(Sesana 2013a; Ravi et al. 2014; Huerta et al. 2015; Sampson
et al. 2015). Inspiral efﬁciency affects both the predicted am-
plitude and the spectral shape of the of GWB, but it is unclear

how the effects described above map into galaxy evolution
parameters.

In this work, we aim to provide an accessible “translation”
of GW strain directly to the parameters contributing to the
largest uncertainties in the GWB spectrum. Our base assump-
tions are 1) circular SMBH binaries, and 2) dominantly GW-
driven inspiral through the nHz–µHz GW band (i. e. a sin-
gle power-law GWB). Section 2 lays out the mathematical
preliminaries of galaxy evolution parameters that contribute
to the strain spectrum. These parameters provide the ba-
sis for our construction of the astrophysical GWB. Section
3 describes the state-of-the-art observational constraints on
these parameters from the literature used in this work. Sec-
tion 4 presents how each astrophysical parameter effects the
strain amplitude, speciﬁcally exploring a direct mapping to
the M•-Mbulge relation. Finally, Sec. 5 explores an example
use-case for the results of this paper.

the frequency of the GWs emitted in the rest frame of the
binary, where Earth-observed frequency f = fr/(1 + z) for a
circular binary. In the absence of external inﬂuence from the
galactic environment, the orbit of such a system changes due
to the emission of gravitational radiation at a rate (Peters &

As in Sesana et al. (2008), we construct the characteristic

strain spectrum for binary SMBHs as

h2
c(f ) =

d4N

dz dM dq d(lnf )

h2
s dz dM dq ,

(3)

where d4N is the number of binaries in a given redshift range
dz, mass range dM, and mass ratio range dq, which are emit-
ting in a given GW frequency range d(lnf ). h2
s is the polar-
ization and sky-averaged strain from each binary in that range,
Eq. 1. Note that we expand chirp mass here into mass, M,
and mass ratio, q, with q ≤ 1: Mc = M (q3/(1 + q))1/5. The
contents of the triple integral encapsulate the total number of
binaries in a given frequency interval which, due to the con-
straints of human lifetime and measurement capabilities, are
predicted based on the evolutionary properties of the galaxies
that host the relevant SMBHs:

d4N

dz dM dq d(lnf )

=

d3n

dz dM dq

dVc

d(lnf )

(4)

In this expression, d3n is the number density of binaries in a
given redshift, mass, and mass ratio range (dz, dM, and dq,
respectively). The resulting conversion takes the number of
binaries per co-moving volume shell, dVc, and converts it to
the number of binaries per earth-observed gravitational wave
frequency bin, d(lnf ). This is done ﬁrst by converting from
co-moving volume shell to redshift, and then converting from
redshift to Earth-observed time.

Given Eqs. 1-4, hc can be written as a power-law with di-

mensionless amplitude Ayr (Jenet et al. 2006):

hc(f ) = Ayr

.

(5)

PTA constraints are often quoted as an upper limit on Ayr
using this basic f−2/3 model of the expected SMBH binary
background. However, PTAs are most sensitive to the GW
frequency close to f → 1/Tobs, where Tobs is the total obser-
vation time, which for current data sets is around ten years.
The constraint on Ayr is extrapolated using a spectral model
of f−2/3. A super-efﬁcient inspiral from environmental cou-
pling could give rise to a different spectral shape of the GWB
(Sesana 2013a; Ravi et al. 2014; Huerta et al. 2015), which
may include a “turn-over” frequency in the PTA band, where
the binary evolution changes from being dominated by energy
removal from environmental coupling to being dominated by
gravitational radiation (Sampson et al. 2015). In this paper,
we work within the single-power-law model, but as PTA lim-
its continue to improve, the extrapolation to a meaningful
limit on Ayr will become increasingly dependent on the as-
sumed shape of the spectrum (Arzoumanian et al. 2015).

2.1. Parameters of Galaxy Evolution

There are no current direct observational constraints on the
demographics of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries.
This work follows the prescription used in Sesana (2013b) and
Ravi et al. (2015), where the galaxy merger rate is used as a
proxy and each galaxy in a merger is populated with a central

The number density of galaxy mergers

is a combination of two functions:
the galaxy stellar mass
function (GSMF), Φ(z, M ), and the galaxy merger rate
R(z, M, q).
The GSMF is an astronomical observable, and is typi-
cally parametrized in terms of a either a single or a double

The galaxy merger rate is the redshift-dependent rate at
which a galaxy of mass M is involved in a major merger

This is calculated by combining the galaxy pair fraction,
fpair(z), and the merger timescale, τ (z, M ). The galaxy pair
fraction is an astronomical observable. The merger timescale,
which approximates the dynamical friction timescale for a dy-
namically bound pair of galaxies, must be determined through
simulations.

Once the number of galaxy mergers has been calculated in
a given redshift, mass and mass ratio range, the mass of each
black hole in the merger is calculated using SMBH-galaxy
scaling relations that have been observed in the local Uni-
verse. Again, we use the prescription described in Sesana
(2013b) to calculate Mbulge for each galaxy assuming some
fraction of the total mass is in the central bulge. This fraction,
fbulge, depends on galaxy morphology and mass. The SMBH
mass is then calculated using a relationship of the form:

log10M• = α + β log10

3. OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS

Sesana (2013b) presented the ﬁrst systematic investigation
of the GWB using the method described in Section 2 and uti-
lized the mean values of many different observations. This
work seeks to update that investigation in a complimentary
way to what was done in Ravi et al. (2015), which used fewer,
but more complete observations and focused closely on the
uncertainties in the galaxy merger rate as well as other uncer-
tainties inherent to the speciﬁc observations used to determine

Translating the GWB and astrophysical measurements

the GSMF and the M•-Mbulge relation. This work attempts to
ﬁnd a balance between these two approaches, using multiple
current and complete observations, while also attempting to
parse which details are more relevant to Ayr predictions.

3.1. Galaxy Stellar Mass Function

The total GSMF is fairly well-constrained by observation
out to z = 1.5 (Tomczak et al. 2014), however there is still
debate about how the total GSMF is broken down by galaxy
type (star-forming vs. quiescent). Quiescent galaxies domi-
nate the GW radiation that PTAs are sensitive to because they
host larger black holes than star-forming galaxies. Therefore,
the break-down of galaxy type as a function of mass and red-
shift has a large impact on the overall signal. We do not as-
sume any kind clustering effect on mergers, so a quiescent
galaxy’s likelihood of merging with another quiescent is only
based on the fraction of quiescent galaxies in a given redshift,
mass, and mass ratio range. Ravi et al. (2015) shows that
while there is some possibility for contamination of colour-
selected GSMFs, the overall effect on the amplitude of the
GWB is negligible compared to other contributions.

In this paper, we use the GSMF measured by the CAN-
DELS/ZFOURGE survey (Tomczak et al. 2014), and the full
UltraVISTA survey (Ilbert et al. 2013) for z > 0.2. The
ZFOURGE survey provides the deepest GSMF measurements
to date (Tomczak et al. 2014), while the UltraVISTA survey
covers a wide ﬁeld and so they compliment each other well.
These two surveys show consistent results with the updated
GSMF from Muzzin et al. (2013) used by Ravi et al. (2015).
This paper uses the SDSS/GALEX observations of the local
universe GSMF (z < 0.2; Moustakas et al. 2013).

3.2. Galaxy Merger Rate & Timescale Between Mergers
The observed galaxy merger rate is a combination of the
observed galaxy pair fraction fpair, and an analytically calcu-
lated merger timescale τ (Eqn. 8). The galaxy pair fraction,
fpair is fairly well constrained in the local universe (z ∼ 0.1),
but it is less constrained with increasing redshift (Keenan
et al. 2014). fpair is expected to peak and turn-over some-
where around z ∼ 2− 3 for the most massive galaxies, which
we are interested in (Conselice 2014). In this paper, we use
the galaxy pair fraction from the GAMA survey (Robotham
et al. 2014) and the combined value resulting from analysis
of the RCS1, UKIDSS, and 2MASS surveys (Keenan et al.
2014). While these two papers agree on the pair fraction in
the local universe (z ∼ 0.1), they differ by a factor of two
on the redshift dependence of the pair fraction, with Keenan
et al. (2014) showing a lower value. Here we keep the val-
ues of fpair ﬁxed out to z = 3, and ﬁnd that the values of
fpair reached are approximately at both the high and low ends
of predictions, respectively (Conselice 2014). While both
Sesana (2013b) and Ravi et al. (2015) use the fpair measure-
ment from Xu et al. (2012), it is not used in this work because
the authors of Robotham et al. (2014) note that a local pair
fraction observation from Xu et al. (2012), which sets both
the low fraction at z = 0 and the high slope of the redshift
dependence of the presented fpair relation, has been shown to
be unrealistic. The revised measurement of Xu et al. (2012) is
shown to be consistent with Robotham et al. (2014).

For self-consistent comparisons, recent observations of the
galaxy pair fraction use one of two formulas for τ (Lotz et al.
2011; Kitzbichler & White 2008), which differ by a factor
of two. The Kitzbichler & White (2008) timescale is a lower

FIG. 1.— Demonstration of the variation in M•-Mbulge correlations in
the literature. The intrinsic scatter parameter, , is shown as a ± vertical
bar for each relation. The points are given by the measurements in the re-
view of Kormendy & Ho (2013). The differences in α and β measurements
depend on a number of effects including: 1) mass range considered; 2) in-
clusion of pseudobulges/other subsample effects; and 3) how bulge mass is
determined (dynamical vs. stellar luminosity). The major difference between
the KH13/MM13 ﬁt and the Sani et al. (2011)/Beiﬁori et al. (2012) ﬁts is
the inclusion of new measurements of galaxies at the highest-mass end for
KH13/MM13.
limit for the galaxy merger timescale because it is derived by a
dark matter halo merger timescale from the Millennium Sim-
ulation. Lotz et al. (2011) calculates τ from a set of hydro-
dynamical simulations, which incorporates gas and dust into
the galaxy merger, unlike Kitzbichler & White (2008). Xu
et al. (2012) combined the mass and redshift dependence from
Kitzbichler & White (2008) with the results from Lotz et al.
(2011) to give a description of the major-merger timescale for
z < 1 which is combined with the pair fractions described
above to give two different galaxy merger rates used in this
work. Since this paper is focused on the effects of observable
galaxy evolution parameters on the GWB we do not inves-
tigate different formulations of tau. However, in Ravi et al.
(2015) the removal of the mass and redshift dependence of τ
was found to produce a slightly higher value for Ayr.

3.3. SMBH mass - Galaxy Bulge Mass Relation

In the past few years, there have been observations of a
steeper relationship than previously observed for the correla-
tion between bulge mass and the mass of the resident SMBH.
The steeper values are largely due to the recent measurements
of the high-mass end of Mbulge, which in turn house the most
massive SMBHs that will contribute to the GW signal in the
PTA band (Scott et al. 2013; Kormendy & Ho 2013; Mc-
Connell & Ma 2013). As we aim to predict the most real-
istic GWB signal as relevant to PTAs, in our simulation we
thus only consider the M•-Mbulge relations that include these
massive galaxy measurements. Figure 1 shows a demonstra-
tion of how the parameters of Eq. 9 vary with the inclusion or
exclusion of measurements at the high-mass end, and various
other considerations. It is unclear whether a single power-law
best describes this relationship over the full mass range (Gra-
ham 2016), but it appears to be sufﬁcient for the most massive
systems, and so in this work we do not consider the broken
power-law prescriptions in Scott et al. (2013). Additionally,
we note that the high mass relation in Scott et al. (2013) is
almost identical to the relation in Kormendy & Ho (2013).

Measurements of the M•-Mbulge relation also include , the
“intrinsic scatter”, which is the natural scatter of individual
galaxies around the trend line described by α and β in Eqn. 9.

FIG. 2.— Predictions of Ayr calculated using Eqn.10. The solid black
line is the total distribution calculated using the errors reported with the mea-
surements we have chosen to use, described in §3. Additionally, the total
distribution is broken down by M•-Mbulge relation, with Kormendy & Ho
(2013) shown in magenta, which is understood to predict higher values of
Ayr because the measurement is weighted strongly by large mass observa-
tions, as seen in Fig1, while McConnell & Ma (2013) shown in blue is not,
and thus creates smaller black hole masses. The breadth of the distributions
results from the observed variance in our input parameters, and also from the
fact that we use multiple formulations for the GSMF and fpair. The most
recent upper limits from each PTA are shown as points directly above the dis-
tribution of Ayr, and above that we show the predictions from similar models
in Sesana (2013b) and Ravi et al. (2015).

This parameter plays a critical role in Ayr predictions as a way
accounting for the outliers in the distribution. The galaxies
containing over-massive black holes will contribute more to
the GW signal in the PTA band than most galaxies of similar
mass and thus are a necessary inclusion into any prediction of
Ayr.

4. RESULTS

Combining all of the observational constraints from §3 into
our model described in Eqn. 10, we calculate a range of pre-
dictions for Ayr. The inputs are allowed to vary within the
reported observational errors for each combination of GSMF,
fpair, and M•-Mbulge relation used in this paper. Each com-
bination is run 500 times for a total of 4000 predictions of
Ayr. Figure 2 shows a plot of this distribution for major-
mergers, q > 1
4, between galaxies with a stellar mass in the
range 1010 − 1012M(cid:12) and lying in a redshift range z < 3.
Additionally, we include the predictions from Sesana (2013b)
and Ravi et al. (2015), and ﬁnd that all ranges on Ayr are
similar. Fig 2 also indicates where recent PTA upper limits
fall in respect to this model’s predictions. The most recently
published upper limit comes from 11 years of data taken
by the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA Shannon et al.
2015), which quotes an upper limit on Ayr of 1.0 × 10−15.
The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational
Waves (NANOGrav) has released nine years of data which
produce an upper limit of Ayr < 1.5 × 10−15 (Arzoumanian
et al. 2015), and the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA)
quoted an upper limit of Ayr of 3.0 × 10−15 (Lentati et al.
2015). PTA upper limits are typically shown to “rule out”
some portion of the predicted range on Ayr. However, it is
often unclear what that means in terms of limits on the input
SMBH evolution parameters. We aim to provide clarity by
determining how, and how much, each parameter effects the
resulting prediction of Ayr.

FIG. 3.— Cumulative fractional contribution to Ayr from binaries over
a range of chirp mass. Each prediction of Ayr is the quadrature sum of
many binaries. The solid black line shows the cumulative fraction of Ayr
that comes from binaries with a given Mc. The gray region shows the one
sigma error region for this distribution. The value of Ayr is dominated by
binaries with Mc > 108M(cid:12), as expected.

As expected for each prediction, Ayr is dominated by bi-
nary sources with chirp masses larger then 108 M(cid:12) as seen
in Figure 3, which shows how the cumulative contribution to
Ayr from increasing chirp masses. Figures 4 & 5 show that
the majority of the signal is produced at z (cid:46) 1.5, also as ex-
pected, but there is a lot of variance at lower redshift, which
is discussed further Section 4.1. Figure 4 shows the contribu-
tion from binaries at different redshifts for both GSMFs used
in this paper. While the general trend is the same for each, the
differences in them directly follow the way that each GSMF
handles the abundance of massive early-type galaxies, specif-
ically between 0.5 < z < 1.5.

At higher redshifts the amount of signal is dominated by the
total number of binaries, which is set in part by fpair. The ef-
fect of different fpair on the redshift distribution of the contri-
bution to Ayr is shown in Figure 5. While both values of fpair
used in this paper have the same value at z = 0, the redshift
dependencies vary by a factor of two. However, as described
in Section 3.2, the two values trace the upper and lower ends
of predictions for fpair at high redshift. An interesting feature
of Figure 5 is that the higher slope fpair from Robotham et al.
(2014) contributes less at lower redshifts than the the lower
slope fpair from Keenan et al. (2014). This trend is directly
related to the number of binaries contributing to Ayr at higher
redshifts.

4.1. Relative effects of GSMF, fpair, and M•-Mbulge

Each parameter in Eqn.10 that has an observational con-
straint also has an associated error. These errors obviously
effect the variance in the ﬁnal strain spectrum prediction. In
Fig. 6, we show the 1 − σ range of predictions for Ayr given
by each combination of observational parameters. The per-
centage contribution to the total error is broken down for each
parameter in a given combination, and shown underneath the
predicted range of Ayr. Below, we discuss the breakdown of
the errors in individual observational parameters impact on
the ﬁnal range of Ayr.

for the two GSMFs used in this work. The redshift distribution of Ayr of the
GSMF from Ilbert et al. (2013) is plotted as blue triangle points, while the

GSMF provides the mass distribution of galaxies as a function of redshift,
and thus affects how each redshift bin will contribute to the total value Ayr.
Above we plot both GSMFs with error bars, which indicate the root-mean-
squared value from all simulation runs. While the majority of the contribution
to Ayr comes from binaries at z (cid:46) 1.5, there is a large amount of variance
which is dominated by the uncertainty in the amount of massive galaxies in
this redshift range. We discuss the relative contributions from variance in the
GSMFs on the variance of Ayr predictions in Section 4.1.

FIG. 5.— Cumulative fractional contribution to A2

yr as a function of red-
shift for the two different observational measurements of fpair used in this
work. fpair is the fraction of galaxy pairs in a certain mass, redshift and mass
ratio range that are undergoing a merger. This parameter sets the number of
sources that will be contributing to Ayr. While both measurements have the
same value at z = 0, the redshift dependencies vary by a factor of two. The
higher slope fpair from Robotham et al. (2014), shown above in red circles,
contributes less at lower redshifts then the lower slope fpair from Keenan
et al. (2014), shown above in green triangles, which is directly related to the
number of binaries contributing to Ayr at higher redshifts.

tions, as can be seen by the breakdown in Figure 2. This is the
relation that provides the translation from galaxy population
to BH mass and therefore sets the mean value of the Mc distri-
bution. Section 4.2.1 discusses in detail how the M•-Mbulge
measurement parameters contribute to A2
yr.
The GSMF plays a large role in determining the variance
of a certain prediction. All mass functions used in this paper
are parametrized using a double Schechter function (Eqn 7)
for z < 1.5, so there are a lot observed parameters included
in each calculation. Looking at each Schechter parameter and

(Robotham et al. 2014), K+14 - (Keenan et al. 2014). Clearly the error from
the GSMF measurements dominate the error budget of each prediction, fol-
lowed by the error from the M•-Mbulge relation. The errors in fpair are
minimal as there is barely a hint of white in each stacker bar graph. The
implications of this plot are discussed in §4.1.
the error bars associated with it reveals that uncertainty in M∗
has the largest effect A2
yr predictions, contributing 45% of the
GSMF error for both observations used in this paper. M∗ is
the mass at which the Schechter function transitions between
the high-mass exponential decay and the lower-mass slopes
α1 and α2. The error from the local GSMF, z < 0.2 (Mous-
takas et al. 2013), is minimal at 2% of the GSMF error, but the
next redshift bin, 0.2 < z < 0.5, in both GSMF observations
used in this paper provides the largest inﬂuence by redshift
on GSMF error contribution to A2
yr at 55% for Tomczak et al.
(2014) and 72% for Ilbert et al. (2013).

The host galaxy’s mass is used to estimate each black hole’s
mass using fbulge. fbulge for quiescent galaxies is described
with two values, one that sets the fraction of mass in the cen-
tral bulge for massive galaxies, M > 1011M(cid:12), and one that
sets the fraction of mass in the central bulge for galaxies with
stellar masses of 1010M(cid:12). Given the dominance of the signal
from binaries with chirp masses above 108M(cid:12), the effect of
the quiescent galaxy’s fbulge on Ayr was calculated. Fig. 7
demonstrates the dependence of Ayr on fbulge for quiescent
galaxies, making it clear that there is not a strong dependence

(less than a factor of ∼ √2).

The pair fraction, fpair, has the least impact on A2

yr. Al-
though the parameter itself has a large range, it only impacts
the number of sources (A2
yr ∝ N), rather than the masses of
those sources.

4.2. Translating GWB Limits and Astrophysical Parameters
The overarching goal of this paper is to provide a mapping
of GWB limit/measurement values to speciﬁc parameters of
galaxy formation. Below, we look at how areas of parameter
space correspond to speciﬁc values of Ayr with an associated
error range.
In our discussions below we aim to make the
following two statements attainable:

FIG. 8.— Relative scaling of Ayr as a function of the intrinsic scatter, , of
the M•-Mbulge relation. As the scatter increases, the black hole mass func-
tion adjusts to include higher mass SMBH systems and as such the overall
strain increases in an exponential manner.

FIG. 7.— Inﬂuence of fbulge on Ayr. fbulge describes the fraction of a
galaxy’s total mass contained in the central bulge. This parameter is used to
estimate a black hole’s mass using the host galaxy’s total stellar mass. For
quiescent galaxies there are two parameters used to set fbulge, a value for
massive galaxies, M > 1011M(cid:12), which is plotted on the y-axis, and a value
for the less massive galaxies, M = 1010M(cid:12), which is plotted on the x-axis.
For galaxies with masses between 1010 − 1011M(cid:12), fbulge is assumed to
follow a log-linear line between the set values. Both of these values were
allowed to vary and the resulting fractional change in Ayr is shown on the
z-axis in color. In this paper we use the values (0.25, 0.9), which is the point
used for comparison in the fractional change shown in the color bar. Overall
there is not a strong dependence on Ayr from the parameterization of fbulge.
• Given a PTA upper limit on the GWB, what speciﬁcally
does this mean for galaxy/SMBH evolution?
• Given a new observation of the M•-Mbulge relation, are
the new values compatible with the best PTA limit? If
not, how can they be reconciled?

4.2.1. GW limits and the Black Hole - Host Galaxy Relation
The parameter space that characterizes the black hole-host
galaxy relation is encompassed by α, β, and . The last of
these is the natural scatter of individual galaxies around the
trend described by intercept α and slope β. This  plays a
critical role in Ayr predictions; as  increases, higher masses
are present in a few binaries, which increases the distribu-
tion of chirp masses and effectively weights Ayr upward. We
demonstrate the implications of this in Figure 8, which shows
the dependence calculated numerically; for any combination
of α and β, changes in  effect A2

yr in the same way.

In Fig. 9, we show contours of constant Ayr in α-β space,
while keeping  equal to zero, as this is the most common way
that the M•-Mbulge relation is reported. Yet, for a speciﬁc
value of α, changing β across the entire range of observed
values translates to only a < 20% change in Ayr. It is thus α
and  that have the most impact on a prediction of Ayr, and so
we combine the results of Fig. 8 & 9 in Fig. 10 to show Ayr
as a function of α and , while holding β = 1.

4.2.2. GW limits and Stalling Binaries

The assumption that galaxy mergers and binary black holes
form at the same cosmological time has until now been im-
plicit in the model used in this paper and others. Yet, as PTA
upper limits become inconsistent with measured astronomi-
cal parameters, the assumptions of this model must be ques-
tioned. It is straight forward to ease this assumption by al-
lowing for a “stall” in the binary SMBH formation. Let us
introduce a variable, Tstall, which is a measure of the time
between the galaxy merger, which occurs approximately on a

FIG. 9.— Mapping of GWB amplitude to M•-Mbulge parameters α and
β. These parameters, with , are used to characterize the black hole-host
galaxy relation described in Eqn. 9 ( = 0 in this ﬁgure). The contours show
constant values of Ayr; note, however, that the contours will scale downward
with  > 0 according to the curve in Fig. 8. Observational measurements are
indicated by diamonds. The grey region accounts for uncertainties in other
measured astrophysical parameters, speciﬁcally the GSMF and the galaxy
merger rate. This uncertainty applies to all values of Ayr but is only shown
on the current best published PTA limit. A set value of Ayr translates to
a collection of α − β pairs, while a PTA upper limit on the value of Ayr
translates to an upper limit on these parameters. Values of α and β which
predict a larger Ayr would be inconsistent with that PTA limit.

dynamical friction timescale, and the binary SMBH entering
the PTA band. This stalling timescale creates a redshift offset
between the galaxy merger and binary SMBH’s in-band GW
emission. This is incorporated into Eqn. 4 like so:

where z1 is the redshift of the galaxy merger, and z2 is the
redshift at which the binary is emitting in the PTA band, while
Tstall is the proper time between z1 and z2. Fig. 11 shows
how Ayr changes with different values of Tstall. Obviously
as the stalling time scale reaches values nearing the Hubble
time, Ayr falls to zero as no systems are expected to ever enter
the PTA band. The meaning and use of limits on Tstall are
described further in Section 5.2.

while this work is able to place tighter constraints by utilizing
a well established range of prior information.

5.1. Constraining α, β, and  with PTAs

It is common for PTA constraints to be quoted as a single
number, Ayr, which represents the 95% upper limit on a GWB
of a given spectral index: for binary SMBHs, αh = −2/3
(Eq. 5). However, quoting a single number is only for sim-
plicity; the actual result produced by PTAs for a limit on a
power-law GWB is a probability distribution for the value of
the strain amplitude.

Here we describe the use of this probability distribution to
obtain direct limits on α, β, and . We then demonstrate how
an inconsistency with an observed value can be used to place
a lower limit on Tstall.

In terms of Bayesian statistics, a PTA produces a posterior

on Ayr,

(cid:90)

p (Ayr|PTA) ∝ p (Ayr) p (PTA|Ayr) ,

(12)
where p (Ayr) is the prior distribution, and p (PTA|Ayr) is
the likelihood. We are interested in producing a posterior on
parameters from our model. As the M•-Mbulge relation pro-
vides the most inﬂuential parameters on Ayr, here we calcu-
late the posteriors on α, β, and :
p (α, β, |PTA) ∝ p (α) p (β) p () p (PTA|α, β, ) . (13)
Our model gives us a way of translating α, β, and  into a
value of Ayr, which means the two likelihoods are equivalent,
(14)
We do need to include other observational parameters into our
model, speciﬁcally the GSMF and the galaxy merger rate. We
will represent all of these parameters with θ, which we can
marginalize over, giving

p (PTA|α, β, ) = p (PTA|Ayr(α, β, )) .

Fig. 12 shows the translation of the recent upper limit from
Shannon et al. (2015) into the parameter space that character-
izes the M•-Mbulge relation. We can set a 95% upper limit in
the 2 − D parameter space, α-, by integrating the distribu-
tion, shown in Fig. 13. Similar work has been done in Mid-
dleton et al. (2016), where an attempt is made to reconstruct a
parametrized form of the black hole merger rate density from
a posterior on Ayr from PTAs. This kind of mapping from
PTA data to astrophysical parameters is the next step forward
in analyzing PTA data and is already being used in recent PTA
limit papers (Arzoumanian et al. 2015).
5.2. Reconciling PTA limits with M•-Mbulge measurements
Fig. 13 demonstrates that the Kormendy & Ho (2013) and
McConnell & Ma (2013) measurements are inconsistent with
the upper limit on the GWB by Shannon et al. (2015). We
can thus attempt to reconcile this discrepancy by consider-
ing whether a non-zero Tstall can make these two results con-
sistent. If we assume the measured values are correct, then
we can do a direct translation of the PPTA upper limit into a
probability distribution on Tstall. This is seen in Fig. 14, and
we set a lower limit of Tstall > 2.3 Gyrs using Kormendy &
Ho (2013) and a lower limit of Tstall > 1.2 Gyrs using Mc-
Connell & Ma (2013).

We reiterate that in our formulation, τ essentially represents
a dynamical friction timescale (the merger timescale), while

FIG. 10.— Mapping of GWB amplitude to M•-Mbulge parameters α and
. These parameters are found to most strongly deﬁne the predicted strength
of GW amplitude. The contours show the value of the Ayr as a function
of these parameters. Observational measurements are shown as indicated.
The grey region accounts for uncertainties in other measured astrophysical
parameters, speciﬁcally the GSMF and the galaxy merger rate. As in Fig. 9,
this uncertainty applies to all values of Ayr but is only shown on the current
best published PTA limit. A PTA upper limit on the value of Ayr translates
to an upper limit on the parameters α and  and would be inconsistent with
parameter values that predict a larger Ayr.

FIG. 11.— Effect of SMBH binary stalling time on the expected amplitude
of the GWB. Tstall measures the time between the galaxy merger and the
binary SMBH entering the PTA band in Gyrs. The predicted value of char-
acteristic strain for a given value of astronomical parameters depends on the
value of Tstall. As the time increases, binaries “stall” for longer and less
reach the PTA band, which lowers the overall strain until the time approaches
a Hubble time and there is effectively no GWB from binary SMBHs.

WITH PTA CONSTRAINTS

5. LIMITING M•-Mbulge AND STALLING TIMESCALE
The following section describes a method by which PTA
constraints can be extended beyond Ayr and into the param-
eter space of galaxy evolution. Similar goals have been pro-
posed using different methods in Middleton et al. (2016). We
note that a key difference between this work and that of Mid-
dleton et al. (2016) is that we interpret PTA limits in the con-
text of other observational constraints on galaxy evolution,
whereas the Middleton et al. (2016) method assumes no out-
side knowledge of the SMBH binary population, except for a
general form of the SMBH merger rate density (which is well
motivated), to formulate their constraints. As such, they were
unable to place meaningful limits on the binary population,

Simon and Burke-Spolaor

(Begelman et al. 1980), although for a few systems with suf-
ﬁcient gas it was shown that binary SMBHs can inspiral ef-
ﬁciently (e. g. Mayer et al. 2007; Cuadra et al. 2009). More
recently, numerical simulations have demonstrated that with
mild triaxiality or axisymmetries in merging galaxies, binary
SMBH coalescence timescales can be pushed to (cid:46) 2.4 Gyr,
and contrary to previous inference,
timescales have been
found to be much less (< 0.5 Gyr) for the highest-mass galax-
ies (Preto et al. 2011; Khan et al. 2011, 2013). Furthermore,
Burke-Spolaor (2011) placed an observational upper limit on
the stalling timescale of the most massive binary SMBH sys-
tems ((cid:38) 108 M(cid:12)) of < 1.25 Gyr at 50% conﬁdence (i. e. a few
Gyrs at 95% conﬁdence). The latter observationally-derived
value is consistent with our lower limits using both the Mc-
Connell & Ma (2013) and the Kormendy & Ho (2013) rela-
tions. However, the theoretical result that inspiral due to host
axisymmetries can be (cid:46) 2.4 Gyr, or beyond < 0.5Gyr for
the highest-mass galaxies we’re probing here, is in contention
with both of these limits. More recent work has shown that
for ‘dry’ mergers, where there is little gas present, the total
merger time is > 1 Gyr (Sesana & Khan 2015), which is con-
sistent with our limits.

There are two likely interpretations of this result. First, if
we assume that the Mbulge relations here hold, we must in-
fer that either something else is reducing the expected GW
background (for instance, a turn-over due to environmental
coupling or a longer merger timescale than assumed here), or
that triaxiality and axisymmetry are not prevalent enough to
be the dominant force in driving pre-GW-dominant inspiral in
massive galaxies. Second, it is possible that the parameteriza-
tions of Mbulge relations have been over-estimated. As a more
general consideration for this analysis, it is worth noting here
that it has been suggested that recent black hole - host rela-
tions might err on using an upper-limit mass value for many
black holes in their ﬁts, for a range of valid values Merritt
(2013, see e. g. the discussion in Chapter 3,). Thus, it is pos-
sible that the McConnell & Ma (2013) and Kormendy & Ho
(2013) measurements have arrived at disproportionately high
values, particularly for α and . Recent work has proposed
there is a bias in these measurements as well (Shankar et al.
2016), and we are currently working to assess what impact
this effect would have on our results, we note that a moderate
downward shift of both the McConnell & Ma (2013) and Ko-
rmendy & Ho (2013) relations in α and/or  would render ﬁts
consistent with current PTA limits (e. g. Fig. 13).

As previously noted, there could exist a deviation from a
single-power-law GWB spectrum due to essentially the oppo-
site effect from stalling: a super-efﬁcient evolution through
low orbital frequencies that also affects the PTA band. This
may lead to a low-frequency turn-over in the strain spectrum
and signiﬁcant additional complexity to PTA analysis (e. g.
Ravi et al. 2014; Huerta et al. 2015; Sampson et al. 2015; Ar-
zoumanian et al. 2015). An investigation of that possibility is
beyond the scope of this paper.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We inspected the amplitude variance of the nHz-µHz wave-
band GWB, as formulated from state-of-the-art observations
of massive galaxies, massive galaxy mergers, and SMBHs in
the z (cid:46) 3 Universe. In the course of this analysis we provided
simple reference plots which can be used to map PTA limits
on the GWB to the parameters of cosmological evolution that
most impact the power-law GWB prediction (Figs. 8–11).

We found that the vastly different observations of the in-

FIG. 12.— Translation of the marginalized posterior distribution of Ayr
into the black hole-host galaxy parameter space, which is characterized by
an intercept α, a slope β, and an intrinsic scatter . β is not informed by
the distribution of Agw, while both α and  are, with a limit on α being
more strongly set. The curves show the 1, 2, and 3σ contours. Since β is
not strongly informed by the upper limit, we can set an upper limit in α-
space by marginalizing over β. This upper limit and relevant observational
measurements of these parameters are shown in Fig. 13.

FIG. 13.— Translation of the 95% upper limit on Ayr into the parame-
ter space α-, which characterizes the black hole-host galaxy relation. The
points above the line are inconsistent with our model. Observed values of
these parameters are shown with error bars.

Tstall represents the additional time it takes the binary to enter
the PTA waveband. Our limits on Tstall could be capturing a
longer merger timescale, such as those discussed in Ravi et al.
(2015). However, since there is not a concrete deﬁnition for
each of these parameters in the literature, we choose to make
the straight-forward assumption that after a standard dynami-
cal friction timescale estimate, the remaining time for binary
evolution is captured by Tstall.

There are a limited number of observational and theoreti-
cal limits on stalling timescales in the literature. Originally,
the apparently “missing” inspiral mechanisms were taken to
imply that binary SMBHs might stall for up to a Hubble time

conclusion drawn from this analysis is that better constraints
on the M•-Mbulge relation will greatly tighten GWB predic-
tions, motivating further SMBH measurements to be made in
the (cid:38) 109 M(cid:12) range. Furthermore, it has been pointed out
that the masses used for many SMBH - host galaxy relations
may be overestimated, potentially solving the discrepancy we
have found, as recently noted in Shankar et al. (2016). How-
ever, this only points more strongly towards a need for better
characterization of these relations to allow an accurate predic-
tion of the GWB, which we intend to pursue in more detail in
future work. The host-galaxy relation is most critical to be
improved if we are to tighten the constraints PTAs can put on
effects such as binary stalling, wandering SMBHs, and en-
vironmental interactions from the inﬂuence of gas or stellar
dynamics during the GW-dominant regime. Finally, while the
redshift evolution of this relation was not considered in this
work, it is clear that strong evolution could further heighten
its impact on GWB predictions (see, e. g., Ravi et al. 2015).

We conclude by reiterating several caveats. We have con-
sidered only a power-law GWB, in which the binary inspiral
is decoupled from its environment throughout the nHz–µHz
GW band. However, a quantiﬁcation of super-efﬁcient evo-
lution due to strong environmental coupling poses an equally
large, if not much larger, source of uncertainty in the low-
frequency end of the PTA band. This must be better assessed
via observational and theoretical work.

the most impact on the range of GWB amplitude prediction.
We used the most constraining PTA upper limit on the GWB
of Ayr < 1.0 × 10−15 from Shannon et al. (2015) to com-
pare with our mapping to these parameters, and found that
the M•-Mbulge relations of McConnell & Ma (2013) and Ko-
rmendy & Ho (2013) are inconsistent with the PTA limit.
Both of these measurements include the high-mass SMBHs
expected to contribute the majority of signal to the PTA gravi-
tational wave band (Kormendy & Ho 2013; McConnell & Ma
2013), making them the appropriate measurements for this
comparison.

As discussed in Sec. 5.2, this inconsistency can be recon-
ciled in a number of ways. First, we can include a moderate
amount of “stalling” in the inspiral of the binary SMBH, in
which the pair slows its evolution for at least 1.2 and 2.3 Gyr
for the α,  values of McConnell & Ma (2013) and Kormendy
& Ho (2013), respectively, which are in contention with the-
oretical work that has shown how axisymmetries may allow
inspiral efﬁciencies of < 0.5Gyr for the most massive pairs.
Observationally, the uncertainty in M•-Mbulge and similar
relations are largely due to small sample sizes. One important
