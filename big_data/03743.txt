Time-dependent density functional theory is widely used to describe excitations of many-fermion
systems. In its many applications, 3D coordinate-space representation is used, and inﬁnite-domain
calculations are limited to a ﬁnite volume represented by a box. For ﬁnite quantum systems (atoms,
molecules, nuclei), the commonly used periodic or reﬂecting boundary conditions introduce spurious
quantization of the continuum states and artiﬁcial reﬂections from boundary; hence, an incorrect
treatment of evaporated particles. These artifacts can be practically cured by introducing absorbing
boundary conditions (ABC) through an absorbing potential in a certain boundary region suﬃciently
far from the described system. But also the calculations of inﬁnite matter (crystal electrons, quantum
ﬂuids, neutron star crust) suﬀer artifacts from a ﬁnite computational box. In this regime, twist-
averaged boundary conditions (TABC) have been used successfully to diminish the ﬁnite-volume
eﬀects. In this work, we extend TABC to time-dependent framework and apply it to resolve the box
artifacts for ﬁnite quantum systems using as test case small- and large-amplitude nuclear vibrations.
We demonstrate that by using such a method, one can reduce ﬁnite volume eﬀects drastically without
adding any additional parameters. While they are almost equivalent in the linear regime, TABC
and ABC diﬀer in the nonlinear regime in their treatment of evaporated particles.

Introduction — The time-dependent density functional
theory (TDDFT) for electronic systems had been devel-
oped as dynamical extension of stationary DFT [1] in
the early 1980ies [2] and has evolved in the meantime
to a widely used, eﬃcient, and reliable tool to describe
the dynamics of all sorts of electronic systems, see [3, 4]
for a review of the basics, and [3, 5–7] for examples of
applications. A parallel development took place in nu-
clear physics where TDDFT is known under the notion
of time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) scheme. TDHF
as such was proposed as early as 1930 in [8]. Applica-
tions to nuclei started in the mid 1970ies when appro-
priate computing facilities became available [9–11]. The
ever-improving computational capabilities had led to a
revival of TDHF without symmetry restrictions, applied
to both ﬁnite systems [12–16] and inﬁnite matter under
astrophysical conditions [17, 18]. The numerical tool of
choice for truly dynamical processes are coordinate- or
momentum-space representations of wavefunctions and
ﬁelds and there exists a great variety of published codes
using these techniques for electronic systems [19, 20] as
well as for nuclear TDHF [21].

A problem pertaining to all numerical solutions of
TDDFT is that one is bound to use ﬁnite basis sets. For
example, the most widely used scheme is based on the
coordinate-space representation of wave functions, den-

sities, and potentials. The size of the box, in which com-
putations are carried out, is ﬁnite, and this implies that
either reﬂecting or periodic boundary conditions (PBC)
are imposed [21]. This leads to unphysical artifacts. One
problem is that particles which are in principle emitted
from the system and thus traverse the box boundaries
are coming back to the system area (reﬂected or reen-
tering the simulation box from the opposite side) and so
perturb the dynamical evolution. Moreover, due to the
presence of ﬁnite box, the continuum states are artiﬁ-
cially discretized, and this produces artifacts at energies
above continuum threshold. Green’s functions methods
allow to cope with this problem in the regime of linear
response [22, 23]. In case of grid representations, one has
to work on the boundary conditions. Outgoing, or ra-
diation, boundary conditions which exactly connect the
dynamics on the grid to free ﬂow in outer space are pro-
posed as solution [24–26], but they are very elaborate
and hard to implement in fully three dimensional grid
representations. An eﬃcient and practical method are
ABC, which were introduced ﬁrst in atomic calculations
[27, 28] and are meanwhile also used in nuclear TDHF
[12, 29, 30]. Although they can be implemented techni-
cally with diﬀerent algorithms, they amount in practice
to adding an imaginary potential in a certain boundary
region. The quality of the absorption depends on the

proﬁle of the imaginary potential and its width [29]. A
good working compromise has to be found in each ap-
plication anew in order to suppress unwanted remaining
reﬂections as much as necessary.

Problems with ﬁnite simulation boxes appear also in
calculations of inﬁnite matter. Periodic boundary condi-
tions are appropriate in this case, and yet, the wave func-
tions are forced to be strictly periodic which induces spu-
rious quantization eﬀects. This can be avoided by TABC
[31–33], often referred to as ‘integration over boundary
conditions’. According to the Floquet-Bloch theorem, a
wave function in a periodic potential is periodic up to a
complex phase shift (twist) when going from one cell to
the next. Averaging over diﬀerent phase shifts very eﬃ-
ciently suppresses unwanted spurious quantization eﬀects
[34–38]. The beneﬁts of TABC have also been demon-
strated in nuclear physics, including time-independent
simulations of inﬁnite nucleonic matter [39–44] and lat-
tice QCD [45–50]. All these successful applications of
TABC indicate that this method can help with the prob-
lem of the unphysically discretized continuum in TDHF
calculations of ﬁnite nuclei. This is the question, which
we aim to investigate in this paper and we do that by
comparing the performance of TABC with that of ABC.
TABC is designed to suppress spurious ﬁnite-size quan-
tization eﬀects and does that very well. It leaves, how-
ever, all particles in the simulation box which means that
the gas of emitted particles is still around and may per-
turb system’s dynamics. By employing ABC, one can
avoid the gas because the emitted particles are removed
eﬃciently. In the same way ABC help to reduce spuri-
ous ﬁnite-volume quantization eﬀects. However, imper-
fect absorption always leaves some quantum beating [29].
Moreover, ABC also absorb the outer tails of bound-state
wave functions; hence, a faint background of spurious
particle emossion is produced (to be avoided by suﬃ-
ciently large boxes). As no practical prescription is per-
fect, we have to balance advantages and disadvantages of
various ways of implementing boundary conditions.

Boundary conditions — TABC are realized by imple-

menting the Bloch boundary conditions

ψαθ(r + T i) = eiθiψαθ(r),

(1)
where θ are three phases or twist angles, T i (i ∈ {x, y, z})
is one of the lattice vectors, ψαθ(r) is the sigle-particle
wave function characterized by the label α. When em-
ploying TABC, one runs separately DFT calculations
with diﬀerent twists θ and averages the results. This
can also be applied to the TDDFT case. An observable
to be evaluated is averaged according to

directions for the isoscalar E2 mode and in the x and y
directions for the isovector E1 mode. The 3D integration
over θ is carried out using an n-point Gauss-Lagrange
quadrature between 0 and π and 2n-point between 0 and
2π. The total number of TABC TDHF calculations to
be performed is thus n3 for the isoscalar E2 mode and
2n3 for the isovector E1 mode. The Slater determinants
|Ψθ(t)(cid:105) are obtained through independent TDHF calcu-
lations with the diﬀerent sets of twist angles θ.
ABC can be realized by either introducing an imagi-
nary absorbing potential in a boundary zone or by apply-
ing a mask function after each TDHF step. Both meth-
ods are equivalent and can be mapped into each other
[29]. Here we use the mask function f (r). One masking
step reads ψα → ψαf (r) with f (r) = 1 for r ≤ L/2−labs;
for L/2− labs < r ≤ L/2; and
f (r) = cos
f (r) = 0 for r > L/2, where L is the cubic box length and
labs is thickness of the absorbing sphere. Optimal values
of p depend on grid spacing and size of time step [29].
Here we use p = 0.0675 throughout. We perform the cal-
culations in two diﬀerent boxes: (L = 32 fm, labs = 6 fm)
or (L = 40 fm, labs = 10 fm). Mind that the absorb-
ing zone is applied at all sides such that the active zone
without absorption has in both cases the same radius of
L − 2labs = 20 fm.
Method — Our calculations are done using the 3D
Skyrme-TDHF solver Sky3d which is based on an
equidistant, Cartesian 3D grid [21]. We use it with a
grid spacing of ∆x = 1 fm and time steps of 0.1 fm/c.
We use the Skyrme energy density functional SV-bas
[51]. The natural boundary conditions for the plane-
wave representation used are PBC. Note that the long
range Coulomb force is treated exactly (i.e., yielding non-
periodic 1/r asymptotics) using a Green’s function for-
malism [52]. Here we have extended the code to accomo-
date ABC and TABC. Our benchmarking calculations
are performed for electric dipole and quadrupole oscilla-
tions of 16O. The oscillations are triggered by an initial
boost ψα(r) → ψα(r) e−iηF (r) where F is the electric
isovector dipole (E1) or isoscalar quadrupole (E2) opera-
tor and η is the excitation strength [53]. This boost aug-
ments the stationary ground-state wave functions with a
velocity ﬁeld which, in turn, drives dynamics. The ob-
servable we look at is the emerging time evolution of the
multipole moment (cid:104)F(cid:105), from which we also produce the
spectral distribution of the multipole excitation strength,
or power spectrum, by the windowed Fourier transform
of the time signal [54].

Results — Figure 1 shows the isoscalar E2 response
at the low excitation energy E∗ = 3 MeV. Compared
are PBC, ABC and TABC(n) results, where n denotes
the number of twists per direction. The time signal in
Fig. 1(a) reveals that PBC induce large-amplitude un-
physical beating pattern after about 1000 fm/c. The
magnitude of these reverberations is as large as half of

We now move to the isovector E1 mode. The corre-
sponding strength function is shown in Fig. 2 for the low
excitation energy E∗. To study the dependence of results
on box size, we compare results obtained with L = 32 fm
and L = 40 fm by keeping the inner region of ABC (no
masking function is applied) the same. The PBC re-
sults (not shown) exhibit the spurious ﬁnite-volume os-
cillations, which strongly depends on the box size. As
the excitation energy is small, there is a small loss of
about 0.1 nucleons in the ABC variant. Overall, ABC
and TABC(4) calculations produce fairly similar strength
functions for both box sizes. The enhanced shoulder
around 24 MeV for L = 32 fm in ABC is a faint remainder
of the artiﬁcial quantization of the continuum [29]. This
feature is wiped out by the improved absorption with
L = 40 fm. Another diﬀerence appears at the main peak
at about 20.5 MeV where both TABC calculations agree
aside from small remaining ﬂuctuations which could be
further reduced by averaging over more twist points. The
maximum for ABC and L = 40 fm appears at a lower en-
ergy and is lower as compared to L = 32 fm.

We now proceed to higher
excitation energies,
E∗
≈20 MeV. In this nonlinear regime for 16O [53], we
look at the power spectrum. Here we take a strictly pe-
riodic dipole and quadrupole operators by replacing the
coordinates with the periodic substitutes as in Ref. [21].
Figure 3 shows results for the isoscalar E2 excitation. In
the time signal, PBC shows the pronounced beat pat-
tern stemming from low-frequency oscillations of nucle-
onic gas moving within the full volume of the box. This
eﬀect is well visible in the E2 mode as the quadrupole
moment, being quadratic in x, y, and z,
is sensitive

the maximum amplitude at t = 0. The use of ABC com-
pletely extinguishes them. While with TABC(2) there
are still some small spurious oscillations, with TABC(4)
the damping appears almost the same as with ABC.
The corresponding strength functions are displayed in
Fig. 1(b). The results obtained with PBC exhibit large
ﬂuctuations due to the discretized continuum. With only
n = 2 points in each direction, these oscillations are al-
most gone in TABC(2). The results in TABC(4) and
ABC variants yield smooth quadrupole strength distri-
butions and both curves are practically the same. Since
TABC(4) represent a good compromise between feasibil-
ity and accuracy, n = 4 is therefore chosen for all follow-
ing calculations.

Although their results look very similar, the mecha-
nism damping the signals are much diﬀerent in ABC and
TABC variants. With ABC, the erratic nucleon gas is
removed from the box whenever it encounters the bound-
aries. In TABC, the gas remains in the box as the particle
number is strictly conserved by Ψθ(t) and every single
run for given twist shows qualitatively the same rever-
berations as PBC. However, these ﬂuctuations enter av-
eraged quantities (2) with diﬀerent phases and so average

ber of particles is strictly conserved and the gas is kept
in the box. This results in a pronounced low-frequency
eﬀect. In ABC, absorbing potential removes most of the
gas eﬃciently leaving only the unavoidable eﬀect from a
loosely bound nucleon halo. There is also a small dif-
ference in the resonance spectra around 20 MeV where
a dip appears with ABC. This can be attributed to an
eﬀect from the nucleon gas in TABC, which disturbs the
dynamics in the resonance region.

to the border areas of the box far from the oscillating
nucleus. The clouds of oscillating nucleonic gas can be
clearly seen in the animations included in Supplemental
Material (SM) [55]. Those spurious long-time ﬂuctua-
tions are eﬃciently wiped out in both ABC and TABC
after t ≈ 500 fm/c. At shorter times, say the ﬁrst 200
fm/c, we see some interesting diﬀerences in the time sig-
nal of TABC and ABC. The initial TABC signal takes a
bit longer to decay and the negative amplitudes are sup-
pressed indicating that the evaporated particles are emit-
ted predominantly in the direction of positive quadrupole
moment (z-direction). As seen in the animations in SM,
the gas particles are absorbed eﬃciently in ABC, which
results in a more symmetric time response.

To understand the eﬀect of the background gas in
TABS, Fig. 4 shows angular-averaged density distribu-
tions associated with E2 vibrations of Fig. 3. The aver-
aging was done by means of Gaussians centered at mesh
points of the original Cartesian 3D grid. At times longer
than 500 fm/c, the resulting nucleonic gas is uniformly
distributed within the volume of the box. The magnitude
of the gas density carries information about the eﬀective
temperature of the system and the particle emission rate
[56–59]. Integrating the gas density results in 0.38 neu-
trons and 0.47 protons, and this nicely agrees with the
number of absorbed particles in the ABC variant.

The power spectrum for PBC shows large ﬂuctuations
in the resonance region around 20 MeV and huge spikes at
energies < 4 MeV. Those peaks are removed by ABC and
TABC and replaced by smooth low-energy bumps associ-
ated with nucleonic gas. In the TABC variant, the num-

for the E1 mode shown in Fig. 5. We see again that ABC
as well as TABC remove the reverberation in the time sig-
nal and the spurious ﬂuctuations in the spectrum. Both
approaches reproduce nicely the strong enhancement of
the low-energy dipole peak at about 10 MeV as well as
the ﬂat proﬁle down to E = 0.

Conclusions — We demonstrated that TABC can be
implemented into TDDFT framework and tested it for
nuclear vibrations. Adding no additional parameters, the
new approach removes spurious ﬁnite-volume eﬀects as
eﬃciently as the previously used method based on ABC.
With only two twist phases per direction one obtains a
reasonable reduction of spurious ﬂuctuations; four twists
per direction oﬀer a good compromise between feasibility
and quality. Since TABC calculations for diﬀerent twists
can be performed independently, the method is easily
adapted to parallel computing.

For low-energy excitations corresponding to the linear
regime, TABC give very similar results as ABC. In the
non-linear regime, ABC absorb noticeable parts of wave
functions which for TABC remain in the box as ﬂoat-
ing nucleon gas. Nonetheless, we see a good agreement.
Both methods suppress eﬃciently the box artifacts and
provide very similar spectra, except for some diﬀerence
in the quadrupole response at very low energies where
TABC shows a sizeable bump associated with the slow
long-range ﬂuctuations of the nucleon gas. ABC is more
eﬃcient in suppressing this artifact.

In future applications,

the new TDDFT+TABC
method will be applied to excitations of heavy, super-
ﬂuid nuclei. Furthermore, we intend to apply TABC to
inﬁnite systems such as nuclear pasta oscillations in the
neutron star crust. In this case, the nucleonic gas rep-
resents physical reality, and the low-frequency bump as-
sociated with the motion of the cloud within the box is
likely to impact the transport properties of the crust.
