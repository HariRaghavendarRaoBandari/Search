3-NETS REALIZING A DIASSOCIATIVE LOOP IN A

PROJECTIVE PLANE

G ´ABOR KORCHM ´AROS AND G ´ABOR P. NAGY

Abstract. A 3-net of order n is a ﬁnite incidence structure consisting of
points and three pairwise disjoint classes of lines, each of size n, such that ev-
ery point incident with two lines from distinct classes is incident with exactly
one line from each of the three classes. The current interest around 3-nets
(embedded) in a projective plane PG(2, K), deﬁned over a ﬁeld K of character-
istic p, arose from algebraic geometry; see [5, 12, 14, 17, 18]. It is not diﬃcult
to ﬁnd 3-nets in PG(2, K) as far as 0 < p ≤ n. However, only a few inﬁnite
families of 3-nets in P G(2, K) are known to exist whenever p = 0, or p > n.
Under this condition, the known families are characterized as the only 3-nets
in PG(2, K) which can be coordinatized by a group; see [10]. In this paper
we deal with 3-nets in P G(2, K) which can be coordinatized by a diassociative
loop G but not by a group. We prove two structural theorems on G. As a
corollary, if G is commutative then every non-trivial element of G has the same
order, and G has exponent 2 or 3. We also discuss the existence problem for
such 3-nets.

1. Introduction

The concept of a 3-net comes from classical diﬀerential geometry via the com-
binatorial abstraction of the concept of a 3-web. Formally, a 3-net of order n is
a ﬁnite incidence structure consisting of points and three pairwise disjoint classes
of lines, each of size n, such that every point incident with two lines from distinct
classes is incident with exactly one line from each of the three classes. It is well
known that every 3-net can be coordinatized by a loop. The set Q endowed with
a binary operation “·” is a quasigroup, if for any a, b ∈ Q, the equations a · x = b
and y · a = b have unique solutions in Q. A quasigroup with a multiplicative unit
element is called a loop. For a general reference on nets, loops and quasigroups see
for instance [1, 4].

In this paper we deal with 3-nets (embedded) in PG(2, K), the projective plane
over a ﬁeld K of characteristic p ≥ 0. Such a 3-net, with line classes A, B, C and
coordinatizing loop G = (G, ·), is equivalently deﬁned by a triple of bijective maps
from G to (A, B, C), say

α : G → A, β : G → B, γ : G → C

such that a · b = c if and only if α(a), β(b), γ(c) are three concurrent lines in
P G(2, K), for any a, b, c ∈ G. If this is the case, the 3-net in P G(2, K) is said to
realize the loop G.

For the purpose of investigating 3-nets in PG(2, K), the groundﬁeld K may be
assumed to be algebraically closed. In order to present the key examples of embed-
ded 3-nets, it is convenient to work with the dual concept. Formally, a dual 3-net
of order n in P G(2, K) consists of a triple (Λ1, Λ2, Λ3) with Λ1, Λ2, Λ3 pairwise
disjoint point-sets of size n, called components, such that every line meeting two
distinct components meets each component in precisely one point. We notice that
ﬁnite dual 3-nets are also called transversal designs.

The following concepts and results have a detailed exposition in [10]. We say
that an embedded dual 3-net is algebraic, if its point set Λ1 ∪ Λ2 ∪ Λ3 is contained
in a cubic curve F . If F is reducible then we speak of pencil type, triangular type or
conic-line type dual 3-net. Except for the pencil type, all algebraic (dual) 3-nets are
coordinatized by either a cyclic group or by a direct product of two cyclic groups.
Finite dihedral groups can be realized by dual 3-nets of tetrahedron type; in this
case the point set is contained in six lines joining four independent points. Finally,
we mention that the quaternion group Q8 has an exceptional realization, cf. [16].
In recent years, ﬁnite 3-nets realizing a group have been investigated also in
connection with complex line arrangements and resonance theory; see [2, 3, 5, 10,
11, 12, 14, 17, 18]. The following almost complete classiﬁcation of such 3-nets is
proven in [10].

Theorem 1.1. In the projective plane P G(2, K) deﬁned over an algebraically closed
ﬁeld K of characteristic p ≥ 0, let (Λ1, Λ2, Λ3) be a dual 3-net of order n ≥ 4 which
realizes a group G. If either p = 0 or p > n then one of the following holds.

(I) G is either cyclic or the direct product of two cyclic groups, and (Λ1, Λ2, Λ3)

is algebraic.

(II) G is dihedral and (Λ1, Λ2, Λ3) is of tetrahedron type.
(III) G is the quaternion group of order 8.
(IV) G has order 12 and is isomorphic to Alt4.
(V) G has order 24 and is isomorphic to Sym4.
(VI) G has order 60 and is isomorphic to Alt5.

A computer aided exhaustive search shows that if p = 0 then (IV) (and hence
(V), (VI)) does not occur; see [13]. It has been conjectured that this holds true in
any characteristic.

In this paper we focus on 3-nets in P G(2, K) which can be coordinatized by a
diassociative loop G diﬀerent from a group. Recall that a loop G is diassociative if
any subloop generated by two elements is a group. There are two important classes
of diassociative loops: Moufang loops and Steiner loops. Moufang loops are loops
satisfying one (hence all) of the following identities.

z(x(zy)) = ((zx)z)y,

x(z(yz)) = ((xz)y)z,

(zx)(yz) = (z(xy))z.

In general, Moufang loops have a rich algebraic structure. This is not the case for
Steiner loops. Steiner loops are diassociative loops of exponent two. Finite Steiner
loops are in one-to-one connection with Steiner triple systems. For other classes of
diassociative loops we refer to [9].

Our results consist of three structural theorems on G.

Theorem 1.2. In the projective plane P G(2, K) deﬁned over an algebraically closed
ﬁeld K of characteristic p ≥ 0, let (Λ1, Λ2, Λ3) be a dual 3-net of order n ≥ 4 which
realizes a diassociative loop G diﬀerent from a group. Let d be the maximum of the

3-NETS REALIZING A DIASSOCIATIVE LOOP IN A PROJECTIVE PLANE

3

orders of the elements in G, and suppose that d ≥ 4. If either p = 0 or p > n then
one of the following holds.

(a) G has a unique subgroup H of order d. Moreover, each element not in H
is an involution, and two such involutions either commute or their product
is in H.

(b) d = 4, and G has a subgroup isomorphic to one of the groups Q8, Alt4.

Theorem 1.3. With the same hypotheses as in Theorem 1.2, assume further that
G contains a subgroup isomorphic to Q8 but no subgroup isomorphic to Alt4. Then
G has a unique involution and the subgroup generated by any two non-commuting
elements is isomorphic to Q8.

It may be observed that a loop G as in Theorem 1.3 deﬁnes a Steiner triple
system in a natural way, namely the points are subgroups of G of order 4 and the
blocks are the subgroups isomorphic to Q8, the point-block incidence being the set
theoretic inclusion.

For a commutative loop G, neither (a) nor (b) of Theorem 1.2 can occur, and

hence d ≤ 3. More precisely, the following result holds.

Corollary 1.4. With the same hypotheses as in Theorem 1.2, assume further that
G is commutative. Then every non-trivial element in G has the same order, and G
has exponent 2 or 3.

The quaternion group Q8 has a counterpart in the class of Moufang loops. Let O
be the division ring of real octonions and let 1, e1, . . . , e7 be an orthonormal basis.
The set

O16 = {±1, ±e1, . . . , ±e7}

forms a Moufang loop with a unique involution −1 and 14 elements of order 4.
(O16 is also called the Cayley loop of order 16.)

Theorem 1.5. With the same hypotheses as in Theorem 1.2, assume further that
G is a Moufang loop. Then G contains either the octonion loop O16, or it has a
subgroup isomorphic to Alt4.

An interesting issue which appears to be rather diﬃcult is the existence and
construction of 3-nets in the classical projective plane PG(2, K) realizing a loop
diﬀerent from a group. All such examples available in the literature are 3-nets of
order n = 5, 6, obtained by computer aided searches; see [16].

2. Proof of Theorem 1.2

Let Λ = (Λ1, Λ2, Λ3) be a 3-net of order n coordinatized by a diassociative
loop G but not by a group. Let g ∈ G be an element whose order is d, and let
Ψ = (Ψ1, Ψ2, Ψ3) be the 3-net (subnet of Λ) coordinatized by hgi. Take any element
h ∈ G not lying in the cyclic group generated by g, and consider the subgroup H
generated by g and h. Obviously, H is not a cyclic group. Since H is a subloop
of G, H also realizes a 3-net ∆ = (∆1, ∆2, ∆3) in P G(2, K). The classiﬁcation
[10, Theorem 1.1] applies to H and yields one of the cases below, apart from the
sporadic cases. Therefore, dismissing (b), we have that either

(i) H is the direct product of two cyclic subgroups, and ∆1 ∪ ∆2 ∪ ∆3 lies on

a plane non-singular cubic curve F3, or

(ii) H is a dihedral group, and ∆ is of tetrahedron type.

4

G ´ABOR KORCHM ´AROS AND G ´ABOR P. NAGY

We ﬁrst investigate case (i). As G is not a group, it must contain an element u 6∈ H.
Replacing h, H by u, U = hg, ui in the above argument shows that U realizes a 3-net
Φ = (Φ1 ∪ Φ2 ∪ Φ3) in P G(2, K), and that U is either the direct product of two
cyclic groups, or it is a dihedral group. The latter case here cannot actually occur.
To show this, observe that if U is dihedral then the maximality of d implies that u
is an (involutory) element lying in some coset of hgi. Since Φ is of tetrahedron type
in this case, we have that Ψ is a triangular 3-net in P G(2, K) of order d. But this
is impossible in our case, since the points of Ψ lie on F3. In fact, F3 is non-singular
while Ψ1 consists of d > 3 collinear points. Therefore, U is a direct product of two
cyclic groups and Φ1 ∪ Φ2 ∪ Φ3 lies on a non-singular plane cubic curve F1. The
intersection F3 ∩ F1 contains all points of Ψ. Since d > 3, this yields F3 = F1.
Since u denotes any element of G outside H, it turns out that Λ1 ∪ Λ2 ∪ Λ3 lies on
F3. But then G itself is a group, the direct product of two cyclic groups. Therefore,
(i) cannot actually occur.

In case (ii), we may assume that H1 = hg, h1i is dihedral for any h1 ∈ G \ hgi.
Therefore, h1 is an involution. Moreover, if h2 is another involution in G, then
either h2 commutes with h1, or h2 lies H1.

3. Proof of Theorem 1.3

From the deﬁnition of a dual 3-net, there is a triple of bijective maps from G
to (Λ1, Λ2, Λ3), say α, β, γ respectively such that a · b = c in G if and only if
α(a), β(b), γ(c) are three collinear points in P G(2, K), for any a, b, c ∈ G.

Choose two elements g1, g2 ∈ G which generate a subgroup H isomorphic to Q8.
We remark that case (a) in Theorem 1.2 cannot occur since both g and h have
order 4. Therefore, d = 4. Set g3 = g1g2; then hg1i, hg2i, hg3i are the three cyclic
subgroups of order 4 in H. Take an element u ∈ G not lying in H.

Assume that u is an involution. For i = 1, 2, 3, the group Ui = hu, gii contains at
least two distinct involutions, and hence it is not isomorphic to Q8. From Theorem
1.1 applied to Ui, we deduce that either Ui is dihedral, or abelian.

We ﬁrst investigate the case when all Ui’s are abelian. Clearly, Ui = hgii × hui ∼=
C4 × C2, and case (a) of Theorem 1.2 holds for the sub 3-net (∆i
3) realizing
Ui. Let Fi be the cubic curve containing ∆i
3. Since Ui is not cyclic, Fi
is nonsingular. These three sub 3-nets of order 8 share a sub 3-net of order 4, say
(Ω1, Ω2, Ω3), realizing the group T = hu, g2
2i. Since |F1 ∩ F2 ∩ F3| ≥ 12 > 9,
this yields that F1 = F2 = F3. But then the sub 3-net realizing H lies on F1 a
contradiction since Q8 is not abelian.

Assume now that U1, U2 are abelian and U3 dihedral. With the same argument,
the dual sub 3-nets realizing U1, U2 are contained in the nonsingular cubic curve F .
The dual sub 3-net realizing U3 is of tetrahedron type, which means that the four
points of α(hg3i) are collinear. The triple (α(hg3i), β(H \ hg3i), γ(H \ hg3i)) is a dual
3-net realizing hg3i. On the one hand, the 8 points of β(H \ hg3i) ∪ γ(H \ hg3i) are
contained in a (possibly degenerate) conic C, see [2, Theorem 5.1]. On the other
hand, H \ hg3i ⊂ hg1i ∪ hg2i ⊂ U1 ∪ U2. This implies β(H \ hg3i) ∪ γ(H \ hg3i) ⊂ F
and |F ∩ C| ≥ 8, a contradiction.

Assume that U1, U2 are dihedral. Hence the dual sub 3-nets realizing U1, U2 are
of tetrahedron type yielding that the four points of α(hg1i) and the four points of
α(hg2i) are contained in the lines ℓ1, ℓ2, respectively. However, α(1), α(g2
2) ∈
ℓ1 ∩ ℓ2, thus, ℓ1 = ℓ2. Similarly, the six points of β(hg1i ∪ hg2i) and the six points of

1 = g2

3-NETS REALIZING A DIASSOCIATIVE LOOP IN A PROJECTIVE PLANE

γ(hg1i ∪ hg2i) are contained in the lines m, m′, respectively. If U3 is dihedral, then
the dual sub 3-net realizing H is contained in ℓ1 ∪ m ∪ m′, which is impossible since
H is not cyclic. If U3 is abelian, then the sub 3-net realizing it is contained in the
nonsingular cubic curve F . The second component of its sub 3-net (α(hg3i), β(H \
hg3i), γ(H \ hg3i)) is contained in m, hence |m ∩ F | ≥ 4, a contradiction.

Assume that u has order 3. Then U is neither a dihedral group nor isomorphic
to Q8. From Theorem 1.1, U = hgi × hui and hence U is a cyclic group of order 12
contradicting the remark at the beginning about case (a) in Theorem 1.2.

Therefore, G contains just one involution v, and if u 6= v then u has order 4. Let
u1, u2 ∈ G be any two distinct elements other than v. Since U contains no element
of order 3, U = hu1, u2i is a 2-group of exponent 4 containing a unique involution.
Since U has order bigger than 4, the only possibility is U ∼= Q8.

Remark 3.1. Let S be the Steiner loop of order 10 corresponding to the Steiner
triple system AG(2, 3). S has a central extension Q of order 20 all proper subloops
are isomorphic to C2, C4, C2 × C4, or Q8.
In particular, Q is diassociative. By
Theorem 1.3, Q has no projective realization despite all its subloops have.

4. Proof of Theorem 1.5

We start with three important facts on Moufang loops of small exponent. First,
as diassociative loops of exponent 2 are commutative, Moufang loops of exponent
2 are elementary abelian groups. Second, by [6, Corollary 1] ﬁnite Moufang loops
of exponent 3 are nilpotent. This implies that any proper ﬁnite Moufang loop of
exponent 3 contains a subloop of order 27. The classiﬁcation of small Moufang
loops [8] shows that Moufang loops of order 27 are groups. Thus, if G is a Moufang
loop of exponent 3 then it contains a subgroup H of order 27. Since no such group
H has a realization in PG(2, K) by Theorem 1.1, we have a contradiction.

Let us assume that G has an element g of order d > 4. Put U = hgi. By
Theorem 1.2, any h ∈ G \ U has order 2 and hU, hi is a dihedral group of order 2d.
In particular, on the one hand, hU = U h, and on the other hand, the involutions
generate G.
[7, Theorem 1] implies that U is a normal subloop of G. For any
subset X of G, let Λi(X) denote the points of Λi, indexed by the elements of X.
[10, Proposition 22] implies that any of the sets Λi(U ), Λi(U h) is contained in a
line.

Choose an element h ∈ G \ U . Then we have four points P, Q, R, S such that
the point sets Λ1(U ), Λ2(U ), Λ3(U ), Λ1(U h), Λ2(U h), Λ3(U h) are contained in the
lines QR, RS, P R, SP, SQ, P Q. In fact, the points P, Q, R, S are the vertices of the
tetrahedron type dual 3-net, corresponding to the dihedral group hU, hi. Only the
vertex S depends on the choice of h; S = Sh.

Choose elements h1, h2 ∈ G \ U such that hU, h1, h2i is a non-associative subloop
of G. Let P, Q, R, Sh1, Sh2, Sh1h2 be the vertices of the tetrahedron type dual nets
of hU, h1i, hU, h2i and hU, h1h2i. The sets

Λ1(U h1), Λ2(U h2), Λ3(U h1h2)

of points form a triangular dual 3-net.
Sh1h2, a contradiction.

[10, Proposition 10] implies Sh1 = Sh2 =

Finally, assume that G has no subgroup isomorphic to Alt4. By Theorem 1.3,
G has a unique (central) involution u. As two non-commuting elements generate
a subloop isomorphic to Q8, the factor G/hui is an elementary abelian 2-group.

Thus, G contains a non-associative subloop S of order 16 with a unique involution.
Using the classiﬁcation of small Moufang loops in [8], S ∼= O16 follows.
