Emergence and Maintenance of Excitability:

Kinetics over Structure

Shimon Marom∗

Abstract

Emergence and maintenance of excitability is often phrased in terms of
arriving at and remaining about a manifold of ‘solutions’ embedded in a
high dimensional parameter space. Alongside studies that extend tradi-
tional focus on control-based regulation of structural parameters (channel
densities), there is a budding interest in self-organization of kinetic pa-
rameters. In this picture, ionic channels are continually forced by activity
in-and-out of a large pool of states not available for the mechanism of
excitability. The process, acting on expressed structure, provides a bed
for generation of a spectrum of excitability modes. Driven by microscopic
ﬂuctuations over a broad range of temporal scales, self-organization of
kinetic parameters extends the metaphors and tools used in the study of
development of excitability.

Highlights

• Excitability entails tuning of both structure and kinetics in a large parameter

space

• Controlled protein expression places a cell in a ballpark of excitability class
• Given expressed structure, self-organized kinetic parameters regulate excitability
• Self-organization of kinetic parameters is driven by microscopic ﬂuctuations
• Controlled expression and self-organized kinetics cover a continuum of timescales

Over half a century of extensive scientiﬁc work teaches us that the phenomenon
of excitability in biological membranes entails tuning of relations in a large
parameter space. A balance of eﬀective expression of ionic channel proteins
having unique gating kinetics is required for the action potential phenomenon
to emerge and be maintained. What is the nature of the processes that constrain
the relations between parameters in the large combinatorial space of all possible
conﬁgurations? While our understanding of the physics underlying membrane
excitability is advanced compared to other physiological phenomena, we are in
the dark when pushed to the corner with this question. Allegedly, even the
basic Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) formal description of excitability [1] – with only

two types of voltage-gated ionic conducting proteins – is not easily tamed when
the kinetic parameters of channel gating are modiﬁed (which occurs due to a
rich protein state space and modulatory processes); or, when the ratio between
the number of diﬀerent channel proteins in the membrane is changed (due to
diﬀerential protein turnover); or, when the membrane capacitance and current
leak change (during massive cell growth, movement or contact of the cell with
biological matrices that impact on membrane surface tension). The natural
phenomenon of excitability is resilient to such changes, or (at least) apparently
more robust than the formal, mathematical models used to describe it.

The problem, it is acknowledged, goes beyond the regulation of excitability; it
belongs to a class of open questions that concern organization in biological sys-
tems in general, the emergence of macroscopic functional ‘order’ from a large
space of potential microscopic ‘disordered’ conﬁgurations [2]••. Addressing this
fundamental question of how cells manage to ﬁnd and maintain ‘solutions’ is
challenging, at least in part, due to methodological limits in distinguishing rel-
evant from irrelevant determinants distributed over broad spatial and temporal
scales [3]•[4]•. The presumed regulatory processes might operate at the levels
of transcription, translation, protein folding and positioning, collective protein-
protein interactions, protein degradation, protein kinetics and the biochemical
modulations of these paths. What makes membrane excitability particularly
attractive to study in this context is the relatively sound understanding of the
functional end-product, the action potential, and its amenability to experimen-
tal manipulations at both microscopic (channel protein) and macroscopic (mem-
brane potential) levels.

Emergence and maintenance of excitability is often considered in terms of ar-
riving at and remaining about a manifold of ‘solutions’ embedded in a high di-
mensional space composed of two families of parameters, structural and kinetic.
In the Hodgkin and Huxley original model, the main structural parameters are
membrane capacitance (CM ), and maximal sodium (¯gNa), potassium (¯gK) and
leak (¯g(cid:96)) conductances, and the many kinetic parameters are expressed as six
transition rate functions: αn(v), βn(v), αm(v), βm(v), αh(v), βh(v). The tables
and ﬁgures exposed by Hodgkin and Huxley in their report [1] suggest that ki-
netic parameters vary over a range of ca. ±20% and structural parameters over
a factor of two or more. A glimpse to the nature of the manifold that supports
excitability in the Hodgkin-Huxley parameter space is provided in Figure 1,
where either pairs of parameters (Figure 1a) or the entire set of ten parameters
(Figure 1b-c) are randomly perturbed over a moderate range (±25% relative to
the original HH values). Clearly, to maintain excitability a ‘coordinated tun-
ing’ of physically independent entities (diﬀerent protein populations and their
kinetic parameters) is required. For each pair of parameters there exists an
‘allowed’ direction of change that is less prone to impact on excitability, and a
‘not-allowed’ direction that is more prone to cause a qualitative modiﬁcation of
the macroscopic order. While imaginable in two-dimensional settings (Figure
1a), coordinated tuning becomes intricate when all parameters are considered
simultaneously (Figure 1b-c). The parameter range apparent in the Hodgkin
and Huxley’s 1952 Journal of Physiology paper is indicative to the fact that
excitable cells actually utilize the space in maintaining functional order. But
the most convincing evidence to that eﬀect comes from a series of studies in the

of parameters is presented as a line connecting the values in a polar plot; several examples
shown in panel (b), where the Hodgkin-Huxley original parameter set is depicted by a thick

relatively well deﬁned settings of the lobster stomatogastric-ganglion, showing
that whether one observes the system from the point of view of a network or
that of the single neuron, degeneracy of functional parametric conﬁgurations
enables the emergence of excitability, as well as its maintenance in response
to a rich repertoire of neuromodulatory eﬀects and unforeseen environmental
challenges [5][6][7]••.

The manifold metaphor enriches the range of concepts available for descrip-
tion of mechanisms underlying the emergence and maintenance of excitability.
Traditionally, we ﬁnd ourselves adopting a control theoretical framework to ac-
count for the coordination between values of diﬀerent parameters, compensat-
ing ‘unwarranted’ changes in one (or more) by intelligibly changing others [8].
The language used includes terms such as error signals, set-points, tuning-rules;

bedrock of physiological thinking. Most studies related to the emergence and
maintenance of excitability use the control theoretical framework to explain the
coordination of structural parameters. These studies, extensively discussed in
the literature (for instance [6, 7]), stem from a general idea presented in the
early 1990’s, coupling channel protein expression to past electrical activity. In-
tracellular Ca2+ concentration is the default choice for a leaky integrator of
electrical activity because its inﬂux through voltage-gated channels is enhanced
by depolarizing membrane potentials; but the general message is independent
of the actual identity of the integrator. Several modeling studies have since
shown that such activity-dependent regulation mechanisms may robustly drive
cells to become excitable. Moreover, activity-dependent regulation of protein
expression levels was oﬀered as an explanation for the diﬀerent realizations un-
derlying similar excitability modes, the ‘many-to-one’ relations exempliﬁed in
Figure 1. In a recent elegant analysis the framework was further extended to
account for experimentally observed patterns of correlation in the expression
of diﬀerent ionic channels, by (reasonably) assuming diﬀerential regulation of
transcription rates [9]. Taken together with advances in understanding tricks
used by cells to optimally control protein synthesis at large (e.g. [10]), these and
related studies mark a steady progress, providing experimental and theoretical
grounds to believe that control-based tuning rules may intelligibly coordinate
maximal conductances – key structural parameters underlying excitability.

Yet, regulation of excitability by controlling densities of membrane channel pro-
teins comes at a price. Even if we turn a blind eye to the entailment of order
N constraints for controlling an N -dimensional system, there is an issue that
concerns timescales. Limited by rates of protein synthesis and degradation, it
is not straightforward to picture activity-dependent control of channel protein
densities as a mechanism covering regulation of excitability amidst dynamic
constraints over the entire spectrum extending from sub-second to hours. In
this context a recently budding stream of ideas suggests a potential contribu-
tion of kinetic parameters to the emergence and maintenance of excitability over
a broad range of timescales. The standard HH model assumes that the state
transitions governing elementary reactions are all voltage dependent, operate at
more-or-less the millisecond range and independent of each other. But as wisely
acknowledged by Hodgkin and Huxley in a comment about the range and appli-
cability of their equations (page 541 in [1]), their assumptions do not hold when
one is interested in dynamics beyond the timescale of a single spike. Even in the
case of the voltage gated sodium conductance – the very engine of excitability
– many years of extensive study (e.g., [11–16]) show that channels ﬂuctuate at
much slower timescales (in an activity-dependent manner) between a pool of mi-
croscopic states that is available for the generation of excitability (depicted A),
and a pool of microscopic states that is not available for such a process, depicted
(1 − A). The set of available states is rather compact and may indeed be imag-
ined as encompassing all the standard Hodgkin and Huxley transitions that are
functionally proximal to the open state (Figure 2a). It is compact in the sense
that the involved states are strongly coupled by rapid voltage dependent tran-
sitions with a characteristic time scale at the range of milliseconds. In contrast,
the set of unavailable states (1 − A) is extended. It may reﬂect many distorted
versions of the functional protein under conditions where the organization, oth-

4

erwise enforced by hyperpolarized membrane potential, is compromised upon
extensive depolarizing activity [17]••. In the (1 − A) set, states are coupled by
a mixture of weak voltage-dependent and voltage-independent transition rates
with time scales ranging from milliseconds to many minutes.
In accordance,
residence times in the unavailable pool are broadly distributed – maybe scale
invariant [11, 12, 18–20] – reﬂecting the depth of the population distribution
in that pool (Figure 2b). This implies a potential to become dormant in an
activity-dependent manner for a duration ranging from tens of milliseconds to
many minutes and possibly hours. Thus, regulation of excitability needs not be
solely based on changes to the expressed structure – i.e., the actual number of
proteins residing in the membrane. Rather, an eﬀective balance between chan-
nel populations amidst dynamic constraints may also be achieved by a process
acting on already expressed proteins. This interpretation is potentially attrac-
tive to explore. It partially relaxes the challenge of tightly controlled structural
parameters, enables local regulation of excitability in complicated oxo-dendritic
morphologies, and opens a wide range of potential excitability conﬁgurations
for a cell to resume while interacting with rich and dynamic input in multiple
time scales.

There are many experimental indications for channel-level broadly distributed
timescales in slow adaptive dynamics of excitability (e.g., [21, 22]), but here we
are interested in ways by which these complex kinetics contribute to regulation
of excitability. One suggestive experimental support to this eﬀect comes from
long-term recordings of response dynamics in detached cortical neurons in-vitro,
using extracellular stimulation (to prevent damaging the cell) and applying care-
ful measures to ascertain experimental stability [23–25]. Such long time series of
evoked spikes (minutes to hours) are dominated by scale-invariant rate statistics.
When closely examined, a given neuron seems to wander around, reversibly vis-
iting diﬀerent activity signatures, changing its excitability status as if randomly
switching identities between reliable, irregular, bursting or compound response
patterns. The reversible nature of this behavior, as well as the durations of
residence in these diﬀerent excitability modes, preclude changes in membrane
protein densities. Such quasi-stable long-term modes (under constant membrane
channel densities) may be accounted for by assuming interaction between slow
channel kinetic parameters and stochasticity; a model of such ﬂavor nicely ﬁts
experimental traces [26]. However, the huge space of unavailable states within
which channels diﬀuse and drift due to electrical activity may oﬀer more:
it
provides a bed for the emergence and maintenance of self-organized, adaptive
excitability modes. An example for eﬀective mapping between rich ionic channel
kinetics, adaptivity and self-organization, involves a low dimensional mathemat-
ical expression of channel population gating – the adaptive rate model [27]. The
general idea is that activity impacts on a global recovery rate from the unavail-
able pool of states as if an hourglass neck narrows down as a function of time
past since the glass was put on its head (Figure 2c–d). Such a process may
be expressed by a logistic-function-like form ˙A = −f (γ)A + g(A)(1 − A) that
captures the essence of the A ↔ (1 − A) dynamics, where f is a function of
the neural activity measure γ, and g(A) is a monotonically increasing function
of the population size occupying state A. As recently pointed out [28]••[29],
this model is formally identical to a mean-ﬁeld expression of a second order

(a) The state-space of voltage-gated ionic channels is di-
vided to available and unavailable state populations; the longer the history of activity the
deeper the channel drifts into the unavailable pool; the time constant for recovery into the
available pool scales accordingly. This is shown in panel (b), where recovery from inactiva-
tion in sodium channels is plotted as a function of duration of past activity (modiﬁed from
[11]).
(c) The behavior shown in panel (b) is analogous to the neck of an hourglass be-
ing modiﬁed by the time passed since it was put on its head. (Image L0011338, CC BY 4.0

phase transition in a global contact process [30].1 Taken together with a nat-
ural feedback that couples between available population (A) and excitability,
the adaptive rate model gives rise to self-organized positioning of the system
about an edge that separates between excitable and non-excitable phases, and
nicely corresponds to experimental observations [28, 29]. Experimental analy-
ses show that as one approaches that edge of excitability [28, 29][31]••, response
ﬂuctuations become larger and slower, tempting to propose a link between the
large space of channel states and the power-law statistics of ﬁring rate. Often,
being edgy is an edge; it enables small changes to signiﬁcantly impact on sys-
tem behavior.
In this context it is admittedly diﬃcult to avoid pointing the
reader’s attention to several similarities between the above cluster of theoreti-
cal and experimental arguments, and the toy model of self-organized criticality
[30, 32–34], reservations acknowledged [35–37].

citability were described. Alongside ongoing studies that focus on control-based
regulation of channel protein expression, a recent interest in kinetic-based self-
organization of excitability was pointed to, where the large space of protein
states and activity-dependent transitions between these states is perceived as a
bed for the emergence and adaptation of excitability modes. One might picture
the emergence and maintenance of excitability as driven by a compound ma-
chinery: structural changes that position the cell in a ‘ballpark’ within which
there are suﬃcient degrees of freedom to move between activity signatures over
a wide range of timescales, reﬂecting activity-dependent changes in kinetic pa-
rameters. The former operates on the timescale of hours or more, whereas the
latter caters to changes at shorter physiological scales. Given this ‘continuum’ of
timescales we might wish to extend our standard models of excitability and treat
these structural and kinetic values as dynamic variables rather than parameters,
at least when dynamics beyond the time scale of a single action potential are
considered.

The study of excitability, from Galvani and Helmholtz, through Adrian, Hodgkin
and Huxley, Neher and Sakmann, all the way to McKinnon’s elucidation of a
channel protein structure, should no-doubt make us physiologists very proud of
our discipline. But there is still a way to go. Present concepts and technolo-
gies make it possible to implement the biophysical understanding of excitability
in the more general context of mechanisms underlying the establishment and
maintenance of functional cellular organization. In doing so, whether we adopt
the path of control theory or the statistical physics one, we should bear in mind
that the full story of the emergence and maintenance of excitability must also
include a relational aspect. As commented elsewhere, pertaining to the wider
context of behavioral and brain sciences [38], searching for the coordinates of a
complex process by focusing solely on what goes on inside the object of analysis
is analogous to searching for a shape of a mug in raw clay; the latter may be used
to create one, but there is no mug in the raw material; it takes interaction with
a ‘potter environment’ to make one. The interactions between the cell and the
tissue (network) within which it is embedded are critical determinants in mould-
ing an instantiation of a given cellular conﬁguration out of the large space of
all possible conﬁgurations. Experimentally analyze and theoretically formulate
the nature of relational processes is no less than the challenge of physiology at
large, a challenge we are still falling short in meeting due to present conceptual
and methodological (to be distinguished from technological) limitations.
