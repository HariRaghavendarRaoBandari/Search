ABSTRACT

The sources SDSS J113126.08-020459.2 and SDSS J110851.04+065901.4 are two double-peaked [O III] emitting AGN, identiﬁed
as candidate binary AGNs by optical and near infrared (NIR) observations. We observed the two sources with high resolution Very
Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) using the European VLBI Network at 5 GHz, reduced VLA observations at three frequencies
available for one of the sources, and used archival HST observations.
For the source SDSS J113126.08-020459.2, the VLBI observations detected only one single compact component associated with the
eastern NIR nucleus. In SDSS J110851.04+065901.4, the VLBI observations did not detect any compact components, but the VLA
observations allowed us to identify a possible compact core in the region of the north-western optical/NIR nucleus. In this source we
ﬁnd kpc-scale extended radio emission that is spatially coincident to the ultraviolet continuum and to the extended emission narrow
line region. The UV continuum is signiﬁcantly obscured since the amount of extended radio emission yields a star formation rate of
about 110 M⊙ yr−1, which is an order of magnitude larger than implied by the observed ultraviolet emission.
Our analysis conﬁrms the presence of only one AGN in the two candidate binary AGNs.

1. Introduction

According to the Λ cold dark matter hierarchical models of
galaxy formation, more massive galaxies are assembled from
smaller ones in a series of minor or major merger events
(Toomre & Toomre 1972). Since most massive galaxies host
a central supermassive black hole (SMBH), a merger be-
tween two galaxies nearly always results in the formation
of a merger-remnant galaxy containing two SMBHs (e.g.
Kormendy & Richstone 1995). If suﬃcient gas accretes onto
both SMBHs, each may be visible as an active galactic nu-
cleus (AGN), forming a so-called “dual” or “binary” AGN.
Gas and stellar dynamical friction aid the shrinking of the bi-
nary AGN, which is gravitationally bound by the stellar bulges
with a separation >∼ 1 kpc. The duration of this stage of the bi-
nary AGN is highly uncertain and depends on the eﬃciency of
the drag from the dynamical friction, but the system will ulti-
mately shrink to form a pc-scale binary SMBH (Begelman et al.
1980; Milosavljevi´c & Merritt 2001; Madau & Quataert 2004;
Escala et al. 2004; Colpi 2014).

In recent years, moderate resolution optical spectra surveys,
such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS Schneider et al.
2010, and references therein) and the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift
Survey (Newman et al. 2013), allowed compilation of cata-
logues of AGNs with double-peaked [OIII] line emission that
were identiﬁed as dual/binary SMBH candidates (Wang et al.
2009; Smith et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2010b; Shen et al. 2011;
Fu et al. 2012). Even though AGN/SMBH pairs are a nat-
ural consequence of galaxy mergers and their search has
received great attention, evidence for such systems is elu-
sive, so only a few conﬁrmed examples have been found

2006; Rodriguez et al.

so far
(e.g. Junkkarinen et al. 2001; Komossa et al. 2003;
Hudson et al.
2006; Bianchi et al.
2008; Comerford et al. 2009; Bondi & P´erez-Torres 2010;
Piconcelli et al. 2010; Koss et al. 2011; Fu et al. 2011b;
Gitti et al. 2013; Deane et al. 2014; Wrobel et al. 2014). A
promising approach to identifying real dual AGN, based on
the wide-area high resolution VLA radio observations of the
SDSS Stripe 82 ﬁeld (Hodge et al. 2011), has been undertaken
by Fu et al. (2015a). This method already conﬁrmed four binary
AGN (Fu et al. 2015b), and would eventually yield a sample
of ∼ 80 conﬁrmed binaries that are bright enough for VLBI
observations.

The

galaxies SDSS J113126.08-020459.2 and SDSS
J110851.04+065901.4 (hereafter J1131-0204 and J1108+0659,
respectively) were classiﬁed as candidate binary AGNs by
Liu et al. (2010b,a), on the basis of spatially resolved double
nuclei in the near infrared (NIR) images, whose locations are
coincident with the two velocity components of the narrow line
emission in the slit spectra (Liu et al. 2010b).

Deep NIR images revealed tidal features and double stellar
components separated by <∼ 2 kpc in both galaxies (Liu et al.
2010a; Fu et al. 2011a). In each of the two objects, optical slit
spectroscopy showed two Seyfert-2 like nuclei that were spa-
tially coincident with the stellar components (within 1 arcsec)
and with velocity oﬀsets of a few hundred km s−1 (Liu et al.
2010b). On the other hand, for J1108+0659 integral ﬁeld spec-
troscopy showed that the extended narrow line region producing
the double-peaked proﬁle is far more complex than originally
thought from the longslit spectra, with most of the emission line
gas in a region oriented perpendicular to the position angle of the
two stellar nuclei (Fu et al. 2012). Finally, the two galaxies were

imaged with Chandra and HST (Liu et al. 2013). In J1108+0659
both nuclei were detected in X-rays (albeit the south-east nu-
cleus only at 3.4σ level), while no signiﬁcant X-ray emission
was detected in J1131-0204.

In this paper we report on Very Long Baseline Interferometry
(VLBI) radio observations at 5 GHz using the European VLBI
Network (EVN) for J1108+0659 and J1131-0204, two of the
four binary AGN classiﬁed by Liu et al. (2010a). For one source,
J1108+0659, our analysis is supported by multi-frequency ob-
servations carried out by the Karl G. Janski Very Large Array
(VLA). For both objects, HST archive observations are available
and are used to complement the discussion.

Throughout, we adopt the WMAP concordance ΛCDM cos-
mology with H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωmatter = 0.27 and
Ωvacuum = 0.73 (Komatsu et al. 2011).

2. Observations and data analysis

2.1. EVNobservations

We observed the radio sources J1131-0204 and J1108+0659
with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 5 GHz (project
code EB050). The observations were conducted in e-VLBI mode
(Szomoru 2008) where the data stream is not recorded on disk
and later correlated, but is directly transferred to the correlator
through ﬁbre links and processed in real time. The maximum
data transmission rate per station was 1024 Mbps for a total
bandwidth of 128 MHz in both left and right polarization, using
two-bit sampling. The observations were carried out on 2011
March 22 in phase-reference mode (e.g. Beasley & Conway
1995). The nearby calibrators J1136-0330 (at a distance of 1.9◦
from J1131-0204) and J1112+0724 (at a distance of 0.9◦ from
J1108+0659) were alternated with the target sources, about 1.5
minutes for the calibrator and 3.5 minutes for the target for a total
observing time of about 2 hr on each target source. The follow-
ing radio telescopes provided useful data: Eﬀelsberg (Germany),
Jodrell Bank Mk2 (UK), Medicina (Italy), Onsala (Sweden),
Torun (Poland), Yebes (Spain), Westerbork (The Netherlands),
Hartebeesthoek (South Africa), and Sheshan (China).

2.1.1. Data calibration and imaging

the

data

sets

using

analysed

We
correlated
the
NRAO Astronomical
Image Processing System (AIPS;
http://www.aips.nrao.edu) for calibration and imaging purposes.
We calibrated the visibility amplitudes using the system tem-
peratures and gain information provided for each telescope. We
then performed a channel-based inspection and editing of the
data, and corrected the bandpasses using scans on the bright
calibrator 4C39.25. We also applied standard corrections to the
phases of the sources in our experiment, including ionosphere
corrections (using total electron content measurements publicly
available). We corrected the instrumental phase and delay
oﬀsets among the baseband converters of each antenna using
observations of the calibrators.

We imaged and self-calibrated (hybrid mapping procedure)
the phase-reference calibrator of each of our target sources, so as
to derive the overall amplitude and phase corrections. We then
transferred those corrections, scan by scan, to the target sources.
Finally, we repeated the fringe-ﬁtting for the phase-reference
calibrators, taking their clean component models into account
to correct for small residual phases resulting from their struc-
ture. We then interpolated the obtained solutions and applied
them to the target sources. We imaged the calibrated visibilities

2

of J1131-0204 and J1108+0659 within AIPS. We note that we
did not perform any self-calibration of the phases, of the ampli-
tudes, or of the target sources, since the peaks in emission were
too faint for such procedures to be applied.

We point out that we kept the averaging integration time to
1 s and used a maximum channel bandwidth in the imaging of
16 MHz, which results in a maximum degradation of the peak
response for components far away from the phase centre of less
than 2% at 500 mas and prevents artiﬁcial smearing of the im-
ages (e.g. Bridle & Schwab 1999).

In imaging our target sources, we applied the following pro-
cedures. When available from high resolution VLA radio im-
ages, e.g. J1108+0659, we used the information on the position
of the radio components as a prior to search for radio emission
on mas scales. For J1131-0204, neither radio images in the lit-
erature nor observations in the VLA archive were available. We
therefore used the information on the position of the nuclei de-
rived from HST observations (Liu et al. 2013). For both sources,
in addition to the ﬁelds around the positions of our priors, we
imaged 25 additional ﬁelds centred on oﬀset positions (where
no radio emission would be expected) to test the reliability of a
possible detection.

2.2. VLAobservationsofJ1108+0659

J1108+0659 was observed in A-array conﬁguration at L and C-
bands (on 2011 July 4) and at X-bands (on 2011 July 13) under
project 11A-175 (PI: Fu). The total bandwidth of the observa-
tions was 256 MHz, split in two adjacent IFs centred at 1.4 GHz
(L-band), 5.0 GHz (C-band), and 8.5 GHz (X band). The source
3C 286 was used as primary ﬂux calibrator, and the compact ra-
dio source J1058+0133 as phase calibrator. The target source
J1108+0659 was observed in L, C, and X bands for about 18,
27, and 21 minutes, respectively. We reduced all three datasets
within AIPS using standard procedures.

2.3. HSTarchivalobservations

We also used HST archival observations of J1131-0204 and
J1108+0659. The two sources were observed using the Wide
Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on board the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST), programme code GO 12363. The two targets were
imaged in the UVIS/F336W U-band and IR/F105W (wide
Y-band) ﬁlters. Details of the observations can be found in
Liu et al. (2013). We registered the HST astrometry derived from
Liu et al. (2013) using the images derived from the VLA data of
J1108+0659. We found that the positions derived by Liu et al.
(2013) in the Y band are consistent with the position of the radio
component C at 5.0 GHz. Moreover, with the astrometry derived
from Liu et al. (2013) the 5σ radio source detected at 1.4 GHz
at about 9 arcsec SW of J1108+0659 overlaps with an optical
galaxy in the Y-band image. The absolute astrometric uncertain-
ties of the registered Y and U-band images are ≃ 0.20′′ and
≃ 0.25′′, respectively.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. J1131-0204

3.1.1. EVN observations

Since no high resolution radio image is available for this source,
we used the position of the two optical nuclei derived from ob-
servations carried out by WFC3 on the HST in the F103W ﬁlter

M. Bondi et al.: Unveiling the radio counterparts of two binary AGN candidates: J1108+0659 and J1131-0204

(Liu et al. 2013). Using our 5 GHz EVN observations we imaged
two 0′′.25 × 0′′.25 ﬁelds around these positions. We detected a
compact feature in the ﬁeld centred on the eastern nucleus, with
a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of about 6.9 (Fig.1). Our EVN im-
age has a resolution of 15 × 15 mas, a peak surface brightness,
and a total ﬂux density since the source is unresolved, of 118
µJy/beam. In contrast, we detected no radio emission above a
5σ threshold of 85 µJy/beam in the ﬁeld centred on the western
nucleus (even imaging larger ﬁeld sizes).

Thus, the position of the putative radio core is αJ2000 =
11:31:26.088 δJ2000= −02:04:59.160, which is oﬀset with re-
spect to the HST position by less than 0.1 arcsec, so well within
the uncertainty of the HST absolute astrometry (Liu et al. 2013).
To test the reliability of this radio detection, we imaged 25 ad-
ditional ﬁelds centred at positions that are slightly oﬀset with
respect to the ﬁrst two in order to be used as test blank ﬁelds.
In each ﬁeld we searched for the brightness peak in a circular
region of radius 0.11 arcsec. We found no brightness peak with
S/N≥ 5.0 in any of the 25 ﬁelds. The mean peak brightness is
60.4 ± 1.7µJy/beam where the error is the error on the mean.
Therefore, we conclude that the EVN detection of the eastern
nucleus of J1131-0204 is signiﬁcant, whilst we can place only
an upper limit for the western nucleus.

3.1.2. The AGN in J1131-0204

This kpc-scale candidate binary AGN is embedded in a massive
disk galaxy at z = 0.1463. Two nuclei, separated by 0.6 arc-
sec, were detected by NIR imaging (Liu et al. 2010a; Shen et al.
2011). The spatial correspondence between the two stellar con-
tinuum peaks and the two [OIII] velocity peaks supported the in-
terpretations that these are two active galaxies (Liu et al. 2010a).
On the basis of line diagnostics, both nuclei were optically clas-
siﬁed as Type-2 Seyferts, implying that at least one AGN must
be present, yet no X-ray emission is detected at the position of
the two nuclei above a 3-σ limit, implying an upper limit on
the (0.5–10 keV) X-ray luminosity of < 1041 erg s−1 (Liu et al.
2013).

From our EVN observations we derive a radio luminosity at
5 GHz for the eastern AGN of LR = 6.5 × 1028 erg s−1 Hz−1. For
the western component, assuming as upper limit in the ﬂux den-
sity the mean peak brightness of 60.4 µJy, gives LR < 3.5 × 1028
erg s−1 Hz−1. We note that these monochromatic radio luminosi-
ties are typical of low luminosity AGN (e.g. Nagar et al. 2005).
The radio core detected at 5 GHz is unresolved. Assuming a limit
on the source sizes given by the FWHM size of the observing
beam, we derive a limit on the brightness temperature given by
Tb >∼ 106 K.

We notice that neither of the two possible nuclei of J1131-
0204 is detected in X-rays. Liu et al. (2013) obtained just an
upper limit for the 0.5 − 10 keV luminosity of 1041 erg s−1.
We estimated the hard X-ray luminosities for both optical nu-
clei expected on the basis of the X-ray to [OIII] luminosity re-
lation for type 2 AGN reported by Ueda et al. (2015). We de-
rived L2−10kev ≃ 5.8 × 1043 erg s−1 and ≃ 4.8 × 1043 erg s−1 for
the candidate western and eastern nuclei, respectively. The com-
parison of these estimates with the upper limits inferred by the
Chandra observation implies a mismatch of a factor of > 100.
This can only be explained by the presence of a very dense,
Compton-thick (NH ≫ 1024 cm−2) obscuring screen along our
line of sight to the nucleus. Indeed, a ratio between the ob-
served and intrinsic X-ray luminosity of a factor of > 70 − 100
is typically derived for Compton-thick Seyfert galaxies (e.g.
Milosavljevi´c & Merritt 2001). As a merging system, it is likely

that a lot of gas and dust have been funnelled into the nuclear
region, providing a likely explanation for the apparent buried
nature of the AGN.

Using the deﬁnition for the radio-loudness parameter of
RX = νLν(5GHz)/LX (Terashima & Wilson 2003), we derived
log(RX) ≃ −5.2 for the radio detected eastern nucleus, assum-
ing the hard X-ray luminosity derived from the [OIII] emission.
This value characterizes the eastern nucleus of J1131-0204 as a
radio-quiet AGN.

Summarizing, from our EVN observations we obtain evi-
dence of just one radio-quiet AGN in J1131-0204, whose po-
sition is coincident, within the errors, with the eastern optical
nucleus.

3.2. J1108+0659

3.2.1. VLA observations

In Fig. 2 we display the contour maps of the images obtained
by the VLA observations at 1.4, 5.0 e 8,5 GHz. At 1.4 GHz
(top panel), the source is slightly resolved with a resolution of
2.30 × 1.38 arcsec, and is ﬁtted by a Gaussian component with
a deconvolved FWHM size of 1.9 × 1.0 arcsec in position an-
gle 16◦. The ﬁtted total ﬂux is 9.82 ± 0.15 mJy, consistent with
the ﬂux of 9.84 mJy measured in the FIRST survey (White et al.
1997).

At sub-arcsecond resolution, the 5.0 GHz and 8.5 GHz im-
ages (middle and bottom panels in Fig. 2) show interesting and
new features. At the intermediate frequency (resolution 0.46 ×
0.37 arcsec), the source morphology is mainly characterized by
three components. The brightest central component (labelled as
C) is elongated at position angle 113◦ and can be ﬁt either by
a single extended component or by two more compact compo-
nents embedded in some diﬀuse emission, mainly on the north-
western side. The total ﬂux of component C is about 1.4 mJy. A
tail of extended emission (labelled as B) is detected in the south-
western direction from the central component. This emission ex-
tends for more than 1 arcsec from component C and accounts for
∼ 0.5 mJy. On the northern side, a resolved component (decon-
volved FWHM size of 0.38 × 0.25 arcsec in position angle 133◦)
with a total ﬂux density of 0.38 mJy is detected (labelled A).
Accounting for the extended emission between the three major
components, the total ﬂux density at 5.0 GHz is 2.6 ± 0.1 mJy.

pact core, labelled C1, detected at position αJ2000 =11:08:51.030

at 5.0 GHz is resolved in two components, A1 and A2, separated

by 0.39 arcsec (about 1.2 kpc) in position angle 140◦, consistent
with the single component ﬁt at 5.0 GHz. The two components
A1 and A2 are both slightly resolved in the NS direction.

3.2.2. EVN observations

We used the information on the position of the radio compo-
nents A1, A2, and C1 from the 8.5 GHz VLA image as a prior to
search for radio emission in our EVN observations. We detected
no radio emission associated to any of these components above
a signiﬁcant level of conﬁdence (≥ 5σ). We therefore put a limit
on the ﬂux density of the mas-scale core of ∼ 85 µJy at 5 GHz.
There are obvious possible reasons for not having detected C1,
the most compact VLA component in our EVN observations. It
is clear from the radio morphology and ﬁtted size that, at the
resolution of the VLA, the component C1 can still be aﬀected
by emission from the eastern lobe, C2, and/or from a jet compo-
nent feeding the lobe on scales of several tens of mas. Therefore
it is possible that we did not detect a core component on the
mas scale due to the sensitivity limit of our EVN observations.
Observations ﬁlling the gap in resolution between the 8.5 GHz
VLA data and our EVN observations at 5 GHz would help to
solve this issue.

3.2.3. Radio spectral index

We derived radio spectral index information for J1108+0659 us-
ing the VLA data at 5.0 GHz and 8.5 GHz, as the resolution of
the 1.4 GHz image is too poor to derive the spectral index of dif-
ferent radio components. To this end, we imaged the two data
sets with the same resolution (0.41 × 0.41 arcsec; see Fig.3).

Then, we combined the images at the two frequencies to pro-
duce a spectral index image and a spectral index error image. We
identiﬁed three main components for which we extract the spec-
tral index information presented in Table 1. For each component
we list the mean spectral index (the mean of the spectral index
values over the region covered by the component) and the dis-
persion of the spectral index values with respect to the mean (σ)
and the mean error, i.e. the mean from the spectral index error
image in the region (σM). The northernmost radio component
(A) contains both components A1 and A2, which cannot be re-
solved at this resolution. The spectral index in this region is very
smooth and uniform (σ = 0.07) throughout the region, implying
that both A1 and A2 have similar spectral properties. The mean
spectral index of this component is 0.4 ± 0.2, where the error
is the mean error of the derived spectral index values in this re-
gion. This radio component is located in the northern tail of star
formation activity.

The central component (C) is clearly extended at both fre-
quencies (Fig. 3). Its is worth noting how the shape, in particular
the position angle, of this component changes with frequency.
At 5.0 GHz, the component is extended with about the same po-
sition angle of the separation between the two optical nuclei and

Fig. 3. VLA images of J1108+0659 used for spectral index analysis. Left panel: image at 5.0 GHz, beam size is 0.41 × 0.41 arcsec,
peak ﬂux is 0.50 mJy/beam, r.m.s noise σ = 0.025 mJy. Right panel: image at 8.5 GHz, beam size is 0.41 × 0.41 arcsec, peak ﬂux

the position angle of the extended U-band emission starting from
the north-west optical nucleus that traces recent star formation
(Fig. 4). We also note how the 5.0 GHz radio emission follows
a ﬁlament of star formation activity in the north-west region of
this component.

At higher frequency, the position angle of component C ﬂips
by about 40◦, most likely due to the emergence of a component
with a ﬂatter spectrum. This emerging component is the candi-
date radio nucleus C1, and it becomes the brightest component
in the high resolution 8.5 GHz image (see Fig.2). The average
spectral index in region C is steep, but not homogenous, and the
rather large dispersion (σ = 0.5) is due to large variations in the
spectral index across the component, owing to the superposition
of components with diﬀerent spectral shapes.

The southern component B has a very steep spectral index
α = 1.5 with σ = 0.8. In this region the large dispersion
is mainly due to the large errors associated to the spectral in-
dex values. The radio emission is clearly associated to the ex-
tended U-band emission-tracing region of star formation activ-
ity. Finally, we made an attempt to estimate the spectral index of
component C1. Component C1 has a total ﬂux of about 200 µJy
and a deconvolved FWHM of 0.14 × 0.04 arcsec in position an-
gle 52◦. This component is not prominent in the 5.0 GHz image,
since it is embedded in the more diﬀuse emission of component
C. This makes it challenging to derive the radio spectral index of
this component. We estimated the radio spectral index of C1 us-
ing ﬂux densities extracted from the same region at 8.5 GHz and
5.0 GHz using images at the highest (but diﬀerent) resolutions,
and obtained αC1 ≃ 0.3 ± 0.2. The uncertainty in the spectral in-
dex value is due to the estimate of the contribution of the diﬀuse
emission to the ﬂux density measured at 5.0 GHz.

3.2.4. AGN and/or star formation emission in J1108+0659

Near-infrared imaging revealed two stellar nuclei, which are sep-
arated by ≃ 0.7 arcsec in position angle 141◦and completely
enshrouded by the extended narrow line emission (Liu et al.
2010a; Fu et al. 2011a; Liu et al. 2013). The extended narrow
line region (ENLR) is centred on the double stellar compo-
nents and extends for several arcseconds in position angle
θENLR ≃ 0◦ (Fu et al. 2012). All the line diagnostics are con-
sistent with the presence and dominance of at least one type-2
AGN with Seyfert-like luminosity (Liu et al. 2010b,a; Fu et al.

2011a, 2012; Shirazi & Brinchmann 2012). Although with lim-
ited conﬁdence, both stellar nuclei are detected in the X-ray
Chandra observations (Liu et al. 2013). The hardness ratio de-
rived for the north-west nucleus is consistent with a steep spec-
tral index of Γ ≃ 2.4, which is typically associated to starburst
galaxies (Dahlem et al. 1998). This hypothesis is also supported
by the estimated soft/hard X-ray luminosity of 4 × 1041 erg s−1,
which is in the starburst range. In contrast, the south-east nu-
cleus exhibits both the X-ray ﬂat spectral shape and luminos-
ity of an obscured AGN, although it was detected at a 3.4σ
level. Speciﬁcally, Liu et al. (2013) measured a column density
of NH ≃ 3 × 1022 cm−2, which implies an X-ray de-absorbed
luminosity of ≃ 1.2 × 1042 erg s−1, suggesting the presence of an
AGN.

On the other hand, the UV-continuum is centred on the north-
west stellar component and extends for a few arcseconds along
the same position angle of the [OIII] line emission. Using the
X-ray to [OIII] luminosity relation for type 2 AGN reported by
Ueda et al. (2015), we derive hard X-ray luminosities of 1 × 1044
erg s−1 and 1.6×1043 erg s−1 for the north-west and south.east nu-
cleus, respectively. While the value for the south-east nucleus is
broadly consistent with that meaured by Liu et al. (2013), there
is a mismatch of a factor ∼ 100 for the north-west component.

C1, which is the most compact radio component and has the
ﬂattest spectral index, is the best candidate for hosting the ra-
dio nucleus of J1108+0659, although the oﬀset of the position
of C1 with respect to the HST and X-ray position of the north-
west optical/NIR core (0′′.29 and 0′′.23, respectively) may cast
some doubts. Still, this value is comparable to the uncertainty in
the HST astrometry. In addition, the relative alignment of the ra-
dio extended emission with the HST U-band emission is rather
good, and it would be worsened if the north-west optical core
would be shifted to the position of C1. Figure 4 shows the oﬀ-
set between component C1 and the north-west UV/NIR core.
Components A1 and A2 have a slightly steeper spectral index
than C1, are less compact, and are distant (> 1 arcsec) from both
stellar optical/NIR nuclei, and therefore they do not seem to be
good candidates for hosting the radio core of an AGN. Moreover,
they are located at the northern peak of the [OIII] narrow line
emission (see Fig.3 in Fu et al. 2012), in a region where intense
star formation is occurring.

Summarising, from our VLA observations, we ﬁnd some ev-
idences that component C1 is the radio nucleus of the AGN: it

5

M. Bondi et al.: Unveiling the radio counterparts of two binary AGN candidates: J1108+0659 and J1131-0204

has the ﬂattest radio spectrum and is the most compact compo-
nent in our highest frequency image. On the other hand, we note
that the presence of a mas-scale compact core is not conﬁrmed
by our EVN observations, albeit this could be explained by lack
of sensitivity, and that the position of component C1 is oﬀset
with respect to the HST and X-ray Chandra position of the east-
ern core. Further high sensitivity data, with an angular resolution
ﬁlling the gap between the 8.5 GHz VLA and 5 GHz EVN obser-
vations, are needed to unambiguously conﬁrm the presence of a
radio AGN in J1108+0659.

The extended UV emission is not the only evidence for
intense star formation in J1108+0659. The source is associ-
ated to the IRAS Faint Source Catalog galaxy F11062+0715
(Moshir et al. 1992; Hou et al. 2009). While the association has
been claimed [by others] as tentative due to the large oﬀset be-
tween the IRAS and optical positions (≃9 arcseconds), we note
that the 1σ ellipse error for F11062+0715 is 27 × 7 arcsec, and
therefore the association seems secure within the uncertainties
of the IRAS position. F11062+0715 has ULIRG-like luminosity
with a total IR luminosity LIR(1 − 1000 µm) = 12.01 (Hou et al.
2009).

An overplot of the radio contours at 5.0 GHz over the U-band
HST image is shown in Fig. 4. The U-band image reveals intense
star formation activity in the north-west nuclear region, while the
south-east nucleus is undetected, indicating a very low level of
star formation around this nucleus, or that the star formation is
highly obscured (Liu et al. 2013).

The extended radio emission is co-spatial with the U-band
UV emission and with the [OIII] line emission, supporting in-
tense star formation as a common origin for the radio and UV
continuum. We notice that the diﬀerent indicators of star for-
mation rate (SFR) give diﬀerent results. Indeed, on the basis
of the U-band luminosity, Liu et al. (2013) derived a star for-
mation rate SFRUV ≃ 10 M⊙ yr−1. On the other hand, using
the total IR luminosity yields a SFRIR ≃ 100 M⊙ yr−1, an or-
der of magnitude greater than derived from the U-band emis-
sion. To derive the star formation rate from the radio emis-
sion, we need to separate the synchrotron emission related to
the AGN (core and lobe/jet emission) from what is associated
with star formation activity. For simplicity, we assume here that
component C (including C1) is produced by AGN-related ra-
dio emission. The total ﬂux density at 5.0 GHz of components
A and B is about 0.9 mJy. Using an average spectral index
α = 0.8, we obtain a radio luminosity at 1.4 GHz associated
to star formation LS F ≃ 2.2 × 1030 erg s−1 Hz−1 corresponding
to a SFR1.4GHz ≃ 110 M⊙ yr−1consistent with the rate derived
from the total infrared luminosity. We conclude that a large part
of the UV-emission must be obscured, yielding a SFR estimate
in this band an order of magnitude less than derived from mea-
surements unaﬀected by dust absorption.

8.5 GHz VLA image (upper panel, HST in greys and VLA in
contours) and with the 5.0 GHz VLA image (lower panel, HST
in greys and green contours and VLA in blue contours). The
overplot with the 8.5 GHz radio image shows the slight oﬀset
between the candidate radio core and the north-west core de-
tected in the UV continuum. The south-east core is undetected
in the UV continuum. The overplot with the 5.0 GHz radio im-
age clearly shows that the extended radio emission and the UV
continuum are cospatial.

4. Summary

We have reported on EVN observations at 5 GHz of two dual
AGN candidates J1131-0204 and J1108+0659 (supported by
multifrequency VLA observations for this source). The main
goal of these observations was to detect, in both objects, two ra-
dio cores to unambigously conﬁrm the presence of a dual AGN.
Our results can be summarized as follows:

– J1131-0204. We detect only one compact radio core, asso-
ciated with the eastern optical/NIR nucleus of this system
with a 5 GHz luminosity of LR = 6.5 × 1028 erg s−1 Hz−1 typ-
ical of low luminosity AGN. For the second possible AGN

in this system we can only provide a 5σ upper limit on its
5 GHz radio luminosity of LR = 3.5 × 1028 erg s−1 Hz−1. No
X-ray emission is detected in either of the optical/NIR nu-
clei, even though the X-ray to [OIII] luminosity relation for
type 2 AGN would yield L2−10kev ∼ 1043 erg s−1 for each of
the muclei. This is a clear indication that the AGN is strongly
obscured by a Compton-thick screen.

– J1108+0659. This merging system is rather puzzling. From
our EVN observations, we can only put upper limits on the
radio luminosity of possible compact cores on the milliarc-
second scale. Using VLA observations we ﬁnd a complex ra-
dio morphology on sub-arcsecond scale with a tentative core
identiﬁcation at 8.5 GHz. The core (component C1) has a ﬂat
radio spectrum and is slightly resolved, and its non detection

M. Bondi et al.: Unveiling the radio counterparts of two binary AGN candidates: J1108+0659 and J1131-0204

in the EVN observations could be consistent with the sen-
sitivity limit of our observations. Moreover, the position of
this tentative radio core is oﬀset (∼ 0.2 arcsec) with respect
to the optical/NIR and X-ray positions of the closest nucleus.
Further radio observations that ﬁll the gap in angular resolu-
tion between the 8.5 GHz VLA and the 5 GHz EVN obser-
vations are needed to establish the nature of the radio core
candidate C1. Most of the extended sub-arcsecond scale ra-
dio emission is closely related to the UV continuum and with
the [OIII] line emission, suggesting that it could come from
intense star formation. Disentangling the AGN-related from
star formation-related radio emission, we derived SFR ≃ 110
M⊙ yr−1that is consistent with what is expected from the to-
tal infrared luminosity, but an order of magnitude higher than
implied by the UV luminosity, in turn implying large obscu-
ration by dust.
