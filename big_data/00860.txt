GOOD REDUCTION AND CANONICAL HEIGHTS OF SUBVARIETIES

BENJAMIN HUTZ

Abstract. We bound the length of the periodic part of the orbit of a preperiodic rational subvariety via
good reduction information. This bound depends only on the degree of the map, the degree of the subvariety,
the dimension of the projective space, the degree of the number ﬁeld, and the prime of good reduction. As
part of the proof, we extend the corresponding good reduction bound for points proven by the author for
non-singular varieties to all projective varieties. Toward proving an absolute bound on the period for a given
map, we the bound between the height and canonical height of a subvariety via Chow forms. This gives the
existence of a bound on the number of preperiodic rational subvarieties of bounded degree for a given map.
An explicit bound is given for hypersurfaces.

1. Introduction

Let K be a number ﬁeld of degree ν = [K : Q] and f : PN → PN be a morphism of degree d deﬁned over
K. Let X ⊆ PN be an irreducible projective subvariety of degree D deﬁned over K. We say X is periodic
if there is an integer n ≥ 1 such that f n(X) = X, and X is preperiodic if f m is periodic for some integer
m ≥ 0.
In the case that the dimension of X is 0, i.e., X is a rational point, Morton-Silverman [19] conjectured
the existence of a constant C(d, ν, N ) bounding the number of rational preperiodic points depending only
on the degree of f , the degree of K, and the dimension. While little is known about this conjecture in
general, adding an additional hypothesis about primes of good reduction yields the existence of a constant
C(d, ν, p, N ) bounding the number of rational preperiodic points, where p is a prime of K where f has good
reduction; for N = 1 see [2, 19, 32], for N > 1 see [16, 24].

When the dimension of X > 1, much less is known. By restricting to coordinate-wise univariate polynomial
maps, Medvedev-Scanlon are able to classify the ﬁxed subvarieties [18]. Studying ´etale maps where X has
at least one smooth rational point, Bell-Ghioca-Tucker are able to bound the size of the periodic part of
the orbit in terms of ν, N, p using p-adic methods [1]. It should be noted that this is not a bound as in the
Morton-Silverman conjecture because it does not bound the number of rational preperiodic varieties, only
provides a bound on the period. However, such a bound on the period for points is a key step in obtaining
the overall bound for points. Furthermore, it is not at all clear that a bound on the number of rational
preperiodic subvarieties is possible. If such a bound exists, it would need to at least depend on the degree of
the subvariety since for a homogeneous bivariate polynomial f of degree d, a map F : P2 → P2 of the form
F = (f (x, z), f (y, z), zd) has inﬁnitely many ﬁxed curves of the form (f n(x), xzdn−1, zdn

).

In this article we prove a bound on the periodic part of the orbit that depends only on (d, s, N, D, p).

Theorem. (Theorem 3.8) Let K be a number ﬁeld. Let f : PN → PN be a morphism of degree d deﬁned
over K. Let X ⊂ PN deﬁned over K be an irreducible periodic subvariety of degree D and codimension t for
f with minimal period n. Let p ∈ K be a prime of good reduction for f . If deg(f ℓ(X)) = deg(f ℓ(X)) for
0 ≤ ℓ ≤ n, then there exists a constant C depending only on d, D, N, t, p such that

n ≤ C(d, D, N, t, p).

The basic idea of the method is to move the problem to an endomorphism of a component of the Chow
variety and appeal to the similar bound for points from the author’s previous work [16]. The restriction on
the degree can be thought of as primes of good reduction for the subvariety and can only not be satisﬁed
for ﬁnitely many primes for a given periodic subvariety. However, this is probably not quite enough for

applications to problems such as the dynamical Mordell-Land conjecture. To apply these methods there, a
more general way is needed to get a bound on the degree of a subvariety in a cycle so that a bound on the
period can be obtained entirely independently of properties of X.

The second part of this article examines the canonical height of a subvariety in terms of its Chow form.
Starting with work of Nesterenko [22] and Philippon [25], heights of elimination forms, a version of the
more general Chow form, was introduced in transcendence theory. Philippon continued to study the heights
of subvarieties via the heights of associated Chow forms and proved many properties of heights and also
canonical heights of abelian varieties [26, 27, 28]. Alternatively, using the arithmetic intersection theory of
Gillet-Soul´e [11], Faltings deﬁned the height of a subvariety X as the intersection of the fundamental class
of X with the ﬁrst Chern class of the canonical hermitian line bundle on PN raised to the power dim(X) [9].
Faltings’ height is the arithmetic analog of the degree in algebraic geometry. Bost-Gillet-Soul`e deﬁned the
height as the intersection of the fundamental class of X with the d-th Chern class of the canonical quotient
hermitian bundle on PN [4]. The arithmetic intersection theory machinery is quite powerful, and they prove
many results on the heights of subvarieties. Furthermore, Zhang is able to prove the Bogomolov conjecture
for abelian varieties [31] with this framework. However, less is done with canonical heights. Gubler studies
local height and canonical heights in this framework. In this article, we extend Philippon’s approach for
abelian varieties to general projective morphisms and prove a number of basic results about the canonical
height of subvarieties [12]. We deﬁne

where h(X) is the height of the associated Chow form. We summarize our main results in the following

2. Preliminaries

Let f : PN → PN be a morphism of degree d. Since f is also proper, the forward image f (X) is a
subvariety. Furthermore, if X is pure codimension t and degree D, then f (X) is pure codimension t and
degree dN−tD. Note that if X is irreducible, then so is f (X). We can explicitly compute forward images
via elimination theory.
Proposition 2.1. Let f : PN → PN be a morphism of degree d and X = V (g1, . . . , gk) be a subvariety. Let
I ⊂ K[x0, . . . , xN , y0, . . . , yN ] be the ideal

I = (g1(¯x), . . . , gk(¯x), y0 − f0(¯x), . . . , yN − fN (¯x)),

2

where ¯x = (x0, . . . , xN ). Then the elimination ideal IN +1 = I ∩ K[y0, . . . , yN ] is a homogeneous ideal and

f (X) = V (IN +1).

Proof. Adapted from [5, Theorem 8.5.12].

We ﬁrst prove that IN +1 is homogeneous. Since the polynomials yi − fi(¯x) are not homogeneous, we
introduce weights: each xi has weight 1 and yi has weight d. Then I is a weighted homogeneous ideal
with degrees deg(gi) = di and deg(yi − fi(¯x)) = d. A reduced Groebner basis G with respect to any
monomial ordering consists of weighted homogeneous polynomials ([5, Theorem 8.3.2]). For an appropriate
lexicographic ordering, G ∩ K[y0, . . . , yN ] is a basis for IN +1 = I ∩ K[y0, . . . , yN ]. Thus, I has a weighted
homogeneous basis. Since the basis is in K[y0, . . . , yN ], it must also be homogeneous.
Now we consider the image and work in the product PN × PN . I is not generated by bi-homogeneous

polynomials, so we need to consider the ideal

J = (g1(¯x), . . . , gk(¯x), yifj(¯x) − yjfi(¯x)).

We show that V (J) is the graph of f (X). Let p ∈ X, then (p, f (p)) ∈ V (J). Conversely, suppose that
(p, q) ∈ V (J). Then we must have p ∈ X and qif (pj) = qjf (pi). There is a j with qj 6= 0 and, since f is a
morphism, an i with f (pi) 6= 0 so that qifj(p) = qjfi(p) 6= 0 so that qi 6= 0. Let λ = qi/fi(p) and we have
q = λf (p) so that (p, q) is on the graph of f (X). Let π2 : PN × PN → PN be the projection to the second
component. Then

f (X) = π2(V (J)).

Now we show π2(V (J)) = V (IN +1).

It suﬃces to work in the aﬃne cone AN +1 × AN +1 and show that π2(V (J)) = V (IN +1) ⊂ AN +1. Once
we exclude the origin, q ∈ π2(V (J)) if and only if there is some p ∈ AN +1 such that q = f (p) in PN so
If we set λ′ = d√λ, then q = f (λ′p), which is
that there is some λ 6= 0 such that q = λf (p) in AN +1.
equivalent to q ∈ π(V (I)). Since V (IN +1) ⊂ AN +1 is the smallest variety containing π2(V (J)) ⊂ AN +1, we
have V (IN +1) = π2(V (J)).

(cid:3)

Since f is ﬂat, the preimage of a degree D pure codimension t subvariety is again a pure codimension t
subvariety. We compute the preimage of X = V (g1, . . . , gk) as f −1(X) = V (g1 ◦ f, . . . , gk ◦ f ) and it has
degree dtD. Note that preimages of irreducible varieties are not necessarily irreducible.

2.1. Chow Forms. We will deﬁne heights and canonical heights in Section 4 in terms of the height of the
associated Chow form. See [10, Chapter 3] for more details on Chow forms.
Deﬁnition 2.2. Let X be an k-dimensional subvariety of PN of degree D. The (N − k − 1)-dimensional
projective subspaces of PN meeting X form a hypersurface in the Grassmannian G(N − k − 1, N ). The
homogeneous form deﬁning this hypersurface in Pl¨ucker coordinates is called the Chow form of X denoted
Ch(X).

The polynomial Ch(X) is degree D and if X is a cycle P nY Y its Chow form is the hypersurface
Q Ch(Y )nY . Note that when X is irreducible, its Chow form is the “forme ´elimiante” from Philippon [25].

There are explicit algorithms to compute the Chow form of a variety, see for example Dalbec [6].

3. Bounding the Period

In this section we show that there is a bound on the period of a subvariety that depends only on the
degree of the morphism, the degree of the subvariety, the dimension of the space, the degree of the number
ﬁeld, and a prime of good reduction. The idea is that for a periodic subvariety we can restrict the function
to an endomorphism of a subvariety of the Chow variety. Then the problem is about periodic points. Since
this restriction may be a singular variety, we need to extend the periodic point theorem from the author’s
previous work [16] to singular varieties. An important tool is the ability to extend morphisms of varieties to
morphisms of projective space from Bhatnagar-Szpiro and Fakhruddin [3, 7].

To be able to restrict to a subvariety of the Chow variety, we need to have an upper bound on the degree
of an element of the orbit. There are a couple issues that arise here. One is that a given orbit can have
elements of diﬀerent degree within the same orbit.

3

Example 3.1. For

we have the orbit

f : P2(F2) → P2(F2)

(x, y, z) 7→ (z2, y2 + xz + z2, x2)

V (y + z) → V (y2 + xz) → V (x + y) → V (x2 + y2 + xz + z2) → V (y + z) → ···

Secondly, there may be ﬁnitely many primes where the degree of the reduced subvariety is not the degree
of the rational subvariety. If we exclude these primes and have a bound on the period modulo p, then we
have an upper bound on the degree of an element in the orbit.

Although not explicit, seeing that there is a bound on the reduced period depending only on p, d, D, N, t
is quite simple. Since there are only ﬁnitely many residue classes of a map of degree d modulo p and only
ﬁnitely many subvarieties of a given degree D, there are only ﬁnitely many possible cycles. So there is, in
fact, a bound on the period of a subvariety modulo p that depends only on p, d, D, N, t.
Lemma 3.2. Let f : PN → PN be a morphism of degree d deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K. Let X ⊂ PN be a
periodic irreducible subvariety of degree D and codimension t deﬁned over K. Let p ∈ K be a prime of good
reduction for f . Then there exists a constant m depending on d, N, D, p, t such that the period of X modulo
p is bounded by m.

Proof. Given D, t, N, p, there are only ﬁnitely many subvarieties deﬁned over the residue ﬁeld of degree at
most D and codimension t (count for example the coeﬃcients of the Chow form). Also, given d, N, p, there
are only ﬁnitely many residue classes of morphisms deﬁned over the residue ﬁeld of degree d. Since X is
assumed periodic, its reduction modulo p must be one of ﬁnitely many possible cycles.
(cid:3)

Example 3.3. As an example consider d = 2, K = Q, p = 2, D = 1. To make the computational feasible we
assume that the degree of an element in the orbit of a degree 1 subvariety is ≤ 8. Then m = 7.

If we assume that deg(f n(X)) = deg(f n(X)), then Lemma 3.2 also gives a bound on the degree of the
subvarieties in the orbit of X as dm(N−t)D. In particular, we can embedded every element of the orbit of
X into the same Chow variety and look at the induced morphism. This restriction requires only excluding
ﬁnitely many additional primes (those which divide the discriminant of the Chow forms of the varieties in
the orbit of X).

We will need to restrict to a particular subvariety of the Chow variety, but ﬁrst we extend the bound on
the period for points using good reduction information to morphisms of possibly singular varieties. We do
this is two diﬀerent ways to arrive at two diﬀerent bounds. First we use a result of Bhatnagar-Szpiro [3].

Proposition 3.4. [3, Theorem 1] Let X be a projective variety deﬁned over an inﬁnite ﬁeld K, L a very
ample line bundle on X and f : X → X a morphism such that f ∗L = L⊗d for some integer d ≥ 2. Then
there exists a positive integer s and a morphism φ : Pm → Pm extending f s, where m + 1 = dimK H 0(X, L).
Moreover, if the linear system H 0(X, L) is complete, then f extends to Pm.

However, to get a bound independent of f and X, we need to show that s can be bounded in terms of

more general information.

Lemma 3.5. Let X be a projective variety of dimension u deﬁned over an inﬁnite ﬁeld K, L a very ample
line bundle on X and f : X → X a morphism such that f ∗L = L⊗d for some integer d ≥ 2. Embedding
X ⊂ Pm with L let D be the degree of X. There exists a constant C(u, d, D) such that the integer s in
Proposition 3.4 satisﬁes

s ≤ C(u, d, D).

Proof. Following the proof of Bhatnagar [3], we need a uniform bound on n0 from Serre’s Vanishing Theorem
such that for all n ≥ n0 we have H 1(Pm, IX (n)) = 0, where IX (n) is the twist of the sheaf of ideals I(n)
of X. Following Harsthorne [14, Proposition 24.4], n0 is bounded over ﬂat families. To apply this to our
situation we consider the Chow variety Ch(D) parameterizing varieties of degree D and dimension u in Pm.
We take a ﬂattening decomposition of this Chow variety, see [20, Lecture 8] or [23, Theorem 4.3]. Let C0 be
the open set of points of Ch(D) where the universal subvariety X of Pm is ﬂat. By [14, Proposition 24.4]

4

there is a uniform n0 for C0. Now consider the family C1, the open set of points of Ch(D) − C0 where X
restricted is ﬂat. On this family there is an n1. Continue this process for the ﬁnitely many possible families
([23, Theorem 4.3]) until we have H 1(Pm, IZ (n)) = 0 for all Z ∈ Ch(D). Then the desired n0 is the max
these ni.
Given this uniform n0, s is chosen so that ds > max(D, n0) ≥ max(deg(hi), n0) where X = V (h1, . . . , hv)
for some set of homogeneous generating polynomials. The second inequality comes form [15, Proposition 3]
on the degree of generators.
(cid:3)

We can now prove the extended theorem.

Theorem 3.6. Let X be an irreducible projective variety of degree D deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K equipped
with a line bundle L giving an embedding X ֒→ PN . Let f : X → X be a morphism such that f ∗L ∼= L⊗d,
d ≥ 2. Let p be a prime of K with residue ﬁeld k for which f has good reduction.
Let P be a periodic point of primitive period n for f whose reduction to the residue ﬁeld k has primitive
period m. Then there is a constant C depending on d, D, N, dim(X), p such that

n ≤ gm′rpe ≤ smrpe.

(cid:3)

Note that even when s is 1, this bound is slightly weaker than [16, Theorem 1] in the multiplier term, but
it has the advantage of applying to singular varieties. Note that [7, Proposition 2.1] gives an equivalent set
of conditions for H 0(X, L) to be complete, i.e., for when s = 1.

Since Lemma 3.5 is not eﬀective, we give a second proof that can provide an eﬀective bound by modifying
Fakhruddin’s construction in [7, Proposition 2.1]. Essentially, by results of Mumford [21, Theorem 1 and 3],
we are able to provide an embedding where s = 1 and just need to keep track of the degrees and dimensions.
Note that this version also removes the dependency on the dimension of X.

Theorem 3.7. Let X be a projective variety of degree D deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K equipped with a line
bundle L giving an embedding X ֒→ PN . Let f : X → X be a morphism such that f ∗L ∼= L⊗d, d ≥ 2. Let p
be a prime of K with residue ﬁeld k for which f has good reduction.

Proof. Let V = H 0(X, L) and let i : X ֒→ P(V ) be the embedding induced by L. For f to extend, we need
to satisfy the following conditions from [7, Proposition 2.1]:

2

(1) The maps i∗ : H 0(P(V ), Ø(n)) → H 0(X, L⊗n) are surjective for all n ≥ 0.
(2) i(X) is cut out set-theoretically by homogeneous forms of degree ≤ d.

From Mumford [21, Theorem 1 and 3], embedding X in a larger projective space with the deg(X)-uple
Veronese embedding and replacing L by a power at most dim(X) + 1 results in satisfying both properties.

We are embedding X in projective space of dimension M = (cid:0)N +D
N (cid:1) − 1. We apply [16, Theorem 1] to the
resulting map ψ : PM → PM , which extends f to have any rational periodic points with minimal period n
satisfying
n ≤ #X(k) · # GLM+1(k) · pe.

(cid:3)

We can now prove the existence of a bound for the minimal period of subvarieties based on good reduction

information.
Theorem 3.8. Let K be a number ﬁeld. Let f : PN → PN be a morphism of degree d deﬁned over K.
Let X ⊂ PN deﬁned over K be an irreducible periodic subvariety of degree D and codimension t for f with
minimal period n. Let p be a prime of good reduction for f . If deg(f ℓ(X)) = deg(f ℓ(X)) for 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ n,
then there is a constant C depending on d, D, N, t, p such that
n ≤ C(d, D, N, t, p).

Proof. Let m be the period of X over the residue ﬁeld k (which is bounded in Lemma 3.2). The morphism

f m induces a morphism φ from the Chow variety of degree D (i.e., PM for M =(cid:0)N +d

of degree dm(N−t)D. We have deg(φ) = dmN . However, there is a closed subvariety of the Chow variety on
which f m preserves the degree (which contains X). This is the subvariety where the image Chow form is a
power. In particular, if we take the image of a symbolic Chow form T of degree D, then the discriminant of
the resulting Chow form of degree dm(N−t)D gives the closed subvariety where the image degree is strictly
less than dm(N−t)D. We can compute this discriminant as [10, Prop 1.7, p434]:

We want the subvariety where the image degree is D. In particular, we need the image to be a dm(N−t)-th

On each irreducible component Y1, . . . , Yv of this subvariety, the map φ induces a map ψi : Yi → PM of degree
dm(N −t) = dmt. Note that the Yi may be singular. Assume, after possibly renaming, that Ch(X) ∈ Y1. This
map is deﬁned by a single set of homogeneous polynomials, but it is not yet a self-map of varieties. Consider
the following construction. Since Y1 is irreducible, the intersection ψ1(Y1) ∩ Y1 is the intersection of two
irreducible subvarieties, so either is Y1 or has dimension strictly less than Y1. If it is all of Y1, then we have
our self-map. If the dimension is strictly less, consider the component Y1,1 of ψ1(Y1) which contains X. We
again consider ψ1(Y1,1) ∩ Y1. Again, we either get a self-map or a strictly smaller dimension that Y1,1. This

6

process will terminate after ﬁnitely many steps in an irreducible variety ˜Y1. Since Ch(X) ∈ ˜Y1 ⊂ PM , this
intersection is nonempty and we have

ψ1 : ˜Y1 → ˜Y1

is a morphism of varieties. To get our ﬁnal constant depending only on d, D, N, t, p we need to know that
the degree of ˜Y1 can be bounded only in terms of d, D, N, t, p. We can bound the degree of ˜Y1 with a
B´ezout type bound. The number of steps in the process is at most dim(Y1) = M − 1. The degree of
Y1 = (M + 1)((dM D − dm)(N − t) + 1). If it takes j steps to get a self map, the degree of each irreducible
component containing X is bounded above by

deg(Y1,i) ≤ (dmt)i(M + 1)((dM D − dm)(N − t) + 1)

for 0 ≤ i ≤ j − 1,

where we let Y1,0 = Y1. The degree at each stage depends on the degree of Y1 and ψ1. Since for each step
we are intersecting an irreducible variety with a hypersurface and the resulting dimension in one less, we can
apply B´ezout’s Theorem on the degree of intersections. Since we are taking only one irreducible component,
this provides an upper bound

deg( ˜Y1) ≤

(dmt)i(M + 1)((dM D − dm)(N − t) + 1).

j−1

Yi=0

Most importantly, the number of steps is bounded by M − 1, and this degree bound depends only on
d, D, N, t, p. We could remove the dependency on p for this bound by removing the dm terms and making
the bound larger.

We apply Theorem 3.6 to ψ1 on ˜Y1 to get a constant such that

n ≤ C(d, D, N, t, p).

(cid:3)

Example 3.9. Consider the map

f (x, y, z) = (x2, y2 + z2, z2).

It is clear that V (z) = {(x, , y, z) ∈ P2 : x = 0} is ﬁxed, so we’ll consider linear subvarieties

T = V (a0x + a1y + a2z).

4. Explicit Heights and Canonical Heights

In this section we prove basic properties of heights and canonical heights of subvarieties as deﬁned by the
height of the associated Chow form. Recall that the height of a polynomial is the maximum of the heights
of its coeﬃcients.
Deﬁnition 4.1. Given a subvariety X ⊂ PN , we deﬁne the height of X as

h(X) = h(Ch(X)),

where Ch(X) is associated Chow form deﬁned in Section 2.

The height satisﬁes the following properties.

Proposition 4.2. Let X ⊂ PN be a subvariety of degree D.

(1) h(X) ≥ 0.
(2) There are only ﬁnitely many subvarieties of bounded height and bounded degree over a number ﬁeld

of bounded degree.

(3) Philippon’s height [26], Faltings height [8], Bost-Gillet-Soul´e’s height [4], and h are all equivalent.

Proof. The ﬁrst two properties are obvious from the defnition of h(X) as the height of Ch(X) as a polynomial.
The third property can be found in Bost-Gillet-Soul´e [4]; see for example Proposition 4.1.2, remark after
Theorem 4.2.3, and remarks starting with 4.3.12.

4.1. Height bounds of forward images. It is well known that for a morphism f and a point P that

for an explicitly computable constant C [29, Theorem 3.11]. Similarly [4, Prop 3.2.2], for a subvariety X of
codimension t, there exists a (non-explicit) constant C such that

|h(f (P )) − dh(P )| ≤ C

h(f (X)) − deg(f )

deg(f (X))

deg(X)

≤ C deg(X).

We ﬁrst prove a lemma on the size of coeﬃcients occurring in resultants.

Lemma 4.4. The map induced on the Chow coordinates in codimension t is a morphism of degree dN−t+1.

Proof. A ﬂat proper map induces a homomorphism between the Chow groups. In particular, a codimension
t subvariety maps to a codimension t subvariety. We can compute the image subvariety via Proposition 2.1.
We think of this map as acting on a projective point representing the coeﬃcients of the Chow form (i.e., the
Chow coordinates). The image coordinates will be polynomials in the original coordinates. Since we know
each image is a codimension t subvariety, this map is a morphism.

To compute its degree, we simply count the number of inverse images under the pullback map. If deg(X) =
dN −t subvariety maps to a degree D subvariety, so the

D, then deg(f −1(X)) is dD. Generically, a degree D
number of inverse images is

dD

dN−t

D

= dN−t+1.

(cid:3)

Theorem 4.5. Let f : PN → PN be a morphism of degree d ≥ 2. Let X ⊂ PN be a hypersurface of degree
D. Then there exists an explicitly computable constant such that

h(f (X)) − d

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

deg(f (X))

deg(X)
8

h(X)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

≤ C(f, N, D).

Moreover,

C =

deg(f (X))/ deg(X)

dN−1

(cid:18)log(τ (deg(f (X)))) + log((cid:18)τ (D) − 1 + e(D) − dN

(cid:19))

+ [4τ (D)(τ (D) + 1)(dN )τ (D)(2dN−1Dh(f ) + log(N ) + log(C) + log(τ (deg(f (X))))

+(τ (D) + 7) log(τ (D) + 1)dN )](cid:1)

Proof. Since X is a degree D hypersurface, it is the vanishing locus of a homogeneous degree D polynomial,
g. Let f (x) = (f0(x), . . . , fN (x)) be a tuple of homogenous polynomials in the variables x = (x0, . . . , xN ).
For a second set of variables y = (y0, . . . , yN ), deﬁne the tuple

J = (yjfi(x) − yifj(x), g(x)) for 0 ≤ i < j ≤ N.

The equations yjfi(x)−yifj(x) are degree d in x and g(x) is degree D. The ideal generated by the generalized
resultant ResD,d,...,d(J) in terms of x is the forward image of X by f . Recall that the generalized resultant
Resdi is homogeneous of degree Q di
in the coeﬃcients of the equation corresponding to dj for each j. In
dj
this particular case, the resultant has degree dN in the coeﬃcients of g and degree dn−1D in the coeﬃcients
of each of the yjfi(x) − fj(x)yi.

It is possible that deg(f (X))

deg(X) < dN−1, i.e., that the resultant is a power. In particular, the

dN −1

deg(X)/ deg(f (X)) -

root of the bound on the resultant is a bound on h(f (X)). We see that an upper bound is given by

where C is the max coeﬃcient in the resultant. From Lemma 4.3, we have

h(Res) ≤ [dN h(X) + dN−1D(2h(f )) + log(N )] + log(C),

log(C) ≤(cid:18)D + N dN + 1

N

(cid:19) + log(cid:18)(cid:18)D + N dN + 1

N

(cid:19)!(cid:19) .

Therefore,

h(f (X)) =

In particular,

The lower bound is somewhat more complicated. The morphism f induces a map on Chow varieties.
These Chow varieties can be thought of as points with their coeﬃcients as coordinates in some projective
space. For ease of notation, denote deg(f (X)) = D′. This induced map is a morphism of degree dN (Lemma
4.4)

where τ (v) =(cid:0)N +v

v (cid:1). For a point P we know that

φ : Pτ (D)−1 → Pτ (D′)−1,
(cid:12)(cid:12)h(φ(P )) − dN h(P )(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ C2

for an explicitly computable (Nullstellensatz) constant C2 [29, Theorem 3.11]. As with the upper bound, if
the degree of f (X) is not the full dN−1 deg(X), we get the actual bound from taking a root. We next bound
the constant.

The size of the domain τ (D) − 1 is one less than the number of monomials in a degree D hypersurface

which is

τ (D) =(cid:18)N + D
N (cid:19)

9

Similarly for τ (D′). Since the degree of the map is dN , from [30, §10] deﬁne

From [29, Theorem 3.11] and [17, Theorem 1], we have

e(D) = τ (D)dN − (τ (D) − 1) + 1 = (τ (D) − 1)dN + 2.

H(P )dN

≤ τ (D′)(cid:18)τ (D) − 1 + e(D) − dN

e(D) − dN

(cid:19) max(H(gi))H(φ(P ))

h(g) ≤ [4τ (D)(τ (D) + 1)(dN )τ (D)(h(φ) + log(τ (D′)) + (τ (D) + 7) log(τ (D) + 1)dN )]
dN h(P ) ≤ log(τ (D′)) + log((cid:18)τ (D) − 1 + e(D) − dN
(cid:19)) + [4τ (D)(τ (D) + 1)(dN )τ (D)(h(φ)

e(D) − dN

+ log(τ (D′)) + (τ (D) + 7) log(τ (D) + 1)dN )] + h(φ(P ))

So we need an upper bound on h(φ). We can get this from an upper bound on the resultant from above
(without the h(V ) part) as

where C is the Wustholz upper bound on the max coeﬃcient in the resultant (Lemma 4.3).

h(φ) ≤ 2dN−1Dh(f ) + log(N ) + log(C),

So we have

dN h(P ) ≤ log(τ (D′)) + log((cid:18)τ (D) − 1 + e(D) − dN

e(D) − dN

(cid:19)) + [4τ (D)(τ (D) + 1)(dN )τ (D)

(2dN−1Dh(f ) + log(N ) + log(C) + log(τ (D′)) + (τ (D) + 7) log(τ (D) + 1)dN )] + h(φ(P )).

Now we take the

dN −1

deg(f (X))/ deg(X) root of both sides (except for the h(φ(P )) term on the right) to get

d

deg(f (X))

deg(X)

h(P ) ≤

deg(f (X))/ deg(X)

dN−1

(cid:18)log(τ (D′)) + log((cid:18)τ (D) − 1 + e(D) − dN

e(D) − dN

(cid:19))

+ [4τ (D)(τ (D) + 1)(dN )τ (D)(2dN−1Dh(f ) + log(N ) + log(C) + log(τ (D′))

This diﬀerence is clearly larger than the upper bound, so this is the desired constant.

+(τ (D) + 7) log(τ (D) + 1)dN )](cid:1) + h(φ(P )).

(cid:3)

We now want to simplify the form of the constant to get a rough estimate of growth. We use two main

tools:

and

(cid:18)n + k

k (cid:19) ≤ nk

Corollary 4.6. Let f : PN → PN be a morphism for degree d ≥ 2. Let X be a hypersurface of degree D.
We have the following bound

n! ≤ nn

so that

log(n!) ≤ n log(n).

h(f (X)) − deg(f )

deg(f (X))

≤ O(D3N log(D)(dN )DN

)

h(X)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where the constant depends on f, d, N .

Proof. We see that an upper bound is given by
deg(f (X))

h(f (X)) − deg(f )

deg(X)

h(X) ≤ [dN−1D(2h(f )) + log(N )] + log(C)

where C is bounded by

So we have

log(C) ≤(cid:18)D + N dN + 1

N

(cid:19) + log(cid:18)(cid:18)D + N dN + 1

N

(cid:19)!(cid:19)

≤ (D + N dN + 1)N + DN N log(D) = O(DN (1 + N log(D))).

dN h(P ) ≤ O(log(DN ) + log((DN )DN

(cid:3)

We can use the above explicit bound to get an explicit bound on the height of a preperiodic subvariety of

degree D by taking an upper bound of the D that can occur in the cycle.

Example 4.7. We compute C for N = 2, d = 2, D = 1.

We ﬁrst compute the upper bound assuming the subvariety remains linear, even though we know it is

smaller than the lower bound.

4.2. Canonical Heights. Gubler proves the existence of a canonical height and local canonical height in
the language of arithmetic intersection theory [12, 13]. We take the more direct approach with Chow forms
in order to obtain a height diﬀerence bound and, thus, an upper bound on the height of a preperiodic
subvariety.

We deﬁne the canonical height as follows.

Deﬁnition 4.8. Let X ⊂ PN be a subvariety of codimension t. Let f : PN → PN be a morphism. Deﬁne

ˆh(X) = lim
n→∞

deg(X)

deg(f n(X))

h(f n(X))
deg(f n)

.

Theorem 4.9. The canonical height converges and satisﬁes the functional equation

ˆh(f (X)) =

deg(f ) deg(f (X))

deg(X)

ˆh(X).

Proof. For convergence, we will show the sequence is Cauchy. Assume that n > m ≥ 0. We will use the fact

Corollary 4.12. Given f : PN → PN , a morphism of degree d deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K, there are only
ﬁnitely many preperiodic rational subvarieties of degree at most D deﬁned over K.

Proof. A preperiodic subvariety has canonical height 0, so there is a height bound on preperiodic subvarieties
of degree at most D. There are only ﬁnitely many rational subvarieties of bounded degree and height. (cid:3)
