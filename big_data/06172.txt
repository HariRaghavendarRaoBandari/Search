Abstract. The covariant and gauge invariant calculation of the current expectation value in
the homogeneous electric ﬁeld in 1+3 dimensional de Sitter spacetime is shown. The result
accords with previous work obtained by using adiabatic subtraction scheme. We therefore
conclude the counterintuitive behaviors of the current in the infrared (IR) regime such as IR
hyperconductivity and negative current are not artifacts of the renormalization scheme, but
are real IR eﬀects of the spacetime.

Investigation of quantum ﬁeld theory in curved spacetime background has a long history.
We cannot put enough emphasis on the importance of the study in the context of cosmology
[1, 2]. Inﬂationary background, which is approximately described by de Sitter spacetime, may
be the most interesting and relevant subject (for a review of inﬂationary cosmology, see e.g.
[3]). One of the greatest achievements in the inﬂationary cosmology is the prediction of the
primordial perturbations which is supposed to become a seed of all the structure in the later
universe. Their calculation is entirely based on quantum ﬁeld theory in curved spacetime
and the agreement with observations infers the correctness of the approach. Not only the
scalar perturbation but also the vector and tensor perturbations can be generated from
the quantum ﬂuctuations in the inﬂationary universe. The cosmic microwave background
(CMB) observations basically espouse the generation of the primordial scalar perturbation.
The primordial tensor perturbation has also been investigated and detection of the primordial
gravitational waves is awaited.

The primordial vector perturbation is usually less signiﬁcant since it only has decaying
modes. On the other hand, the observations of galactic/extragalactic magnetic ﬁeld [4–11]
indicate the existence of large scale magnetic ﬁeld in extragalactic scale whose origin is yet
to be clariﬁed. The inﬂationary magnetogenesis is a serious candidate since it may be able
to produce coherent magnetic ﬁelds on large scale, especially, extragalactic scales (∼Mpc).
Thus it is motivated to modify the standard theory which is conformally invariant and hence
no long-wave perturbations are expected so that the primordial vector perturbation can
be generated during inﬂationary era. Among many proposed mechanisms of inﬂationary
magnetogenesis, one of the most actively investigated models is the so-called f 2F F model
[12–16] where the kinetic term has a nontrivial time dependence. However, it suﬀers from
the backreaction problem, namely, overproduction of the electric ﬁelds which occurs if one
tries to avoid the strong coupling problem of the theory [17].

– 1 –

A natural consequence of the strong electric ﬁeld is pair production of charged particles
known as the Schwinger eﬀect [18], which is an example of the nonperturbative eﬀect of
the quantum ﬁeld theory. Recently, several studies on this subject in de Sitter spacetime
have been done [19–24]. Their motivations vary widely from false vacuum decay and bubble
nucleation to a thermal interpretation of particle production or cosmological consequences
including magnetogenesis. The particle production rate can be calculated once the Bogoli-
ubov coeﬃcients, which constitute the connection matrix between the in-vacuum and the
out-vacuum mode function, are obtained. The real obstacle is the lack of the proper deﬁni-
tion of the out-vacuum state at an arbitrary time in curved spacetime. In order to estimate
the back reaction of the Schwinger eﬀect, we do not need to calculate the particle production
rate itself but instead the time evolution of the expectation value of the induced current
would suﬃce. This is the strategy adopted in [20, 22–24]. So far, the vacuum expectation
value of the current has been calculated for scalar quantum electrodynamics (QED) in 1 + 1
dimensional de Sitter spacetime [20], in 1 + 2 dimension [24], in 1 + 3 dimension [22] and for
spinor QED in 1 + 1 dimensional de Sitter spacetime [23], in 1 + 3 dimension [25]. The adi-
abatic subtraction scheme up to second order was employed to obtain a regularized current
in [22], while it is necessary to do the fourth order regularization to obtain ﬁnite expression
of the energy momentum tensor. Hence it is desired to compare their result with those using
other renormalization schemes.

Another issue is that the previous calculation also used momentum cutoﬀ to control the
divergence, which breaks the gauge invariance. It is well-known that the gauge symmetry
ensures the renormalizability of QED theory. Actually, cutoﬀ regularization brought about
unrenormalizable divergence(s) to the theory. To avoid this problem, we have to regularize
the divergence in a gauge-invariant way. Dimensional regularization is often used for this
purpose but it does not work in our case, as it does not control the divergence. Instead, we
can make use of the point splitting technique [1, 26] . In this scheme, the covariant point
separation is used to control the divergence.

Our aim in this paper is to perform the point-splitting renormalization of the vacuum
expectation value of the scalar current in 1 + 3 dimensional de Sitter spacetime in a covariant
and gauge invariant way. We choose the physically same background gauge ﬁeld seen in [22].
The construction of this paper is as follows. In Sec. 2, we will introduce the method
In Sec. 3, the properties of the result will be investigated.
of calculation and perform it.
In Sec. 4, a possible physical interpretation for the result is given. Finally, summary and
conclusion are given in Sec. 5.

2 Point splitting renormalization of Schwinger induced current

2.1 Set up

We investigate the scalar QED theory consisting of an U(1) gauge ﬁeld Aµ(x, t) and a complex
scalar ﬁeld φ(x, t) with charge e in de Sitter space

ds2 = gµν dxµdxν = −dt2 + e2Htdx2 = a2(η)(−dη2 + dx2),

a(η) =

(2.2)

– 2 –

with Dµ = ∂µ +ieAµ and Fµν = ∇µAν −∇νAµ . We treat the gauge ﬁeld Aµ as a background
ﬁeld giving rise to a constant electric ﬁeld. That is, we choose its conﬁguration as

Aµ(x) = (0, 0, 0, Az (η)), Az(η) = −

E
H

(a(η) − 1).

(2.3)

As deﬁned in (2.1) we take the scale factor as a(η) = eHt = (1− Hη)−1 so that we can obtain
the explicit Minkowski (H → 0) limit, Az(η) → −Et.

The local current operator is deﬁned by

ˆJµ(x) ≡ ie ˆφ†(x)←→Dµ ˆφ(x) = ie{ ˆφ†(x)Dµ ˆφ(x) − (Dµ ˆφ(x))† ˆφ(x)}.

(2.4)

As the vacuum expectation value of this operator is divergent, we adopt the point separation
xµ → xµ ± ǫµ to control the divergence and renormalize it in a gauge-invariant manner.

2.2

gauge-invariant two-point current operator

The gauge-invariant two-point current operator with symmetric point separation is given by

ˆJµ(x; ǫ) ≡ ie exp(cid:20)−ieZ x+ǫ

x−ǫ

dxµAµ(cid:21) ˆφ†(x + ǫ)←→Dµ ˆφ(x − ǫ),

which is invariant under the gauge transformation with an arbitrary function Γ(x),
ˆφ(x)† → e+ieΓ(x) ˆφ†(x), Aµ(x) → Aµ + Γ,µ(x).

ˆφ(x) → e−ieΓ(x) ˆφ(x),

(2.5)

(2.6)

Note that the covariant derivative is transformed as Dµ ˆφ(x) → e−ieΓ(x)Dµ ˆφ(x) and changes
the overall phase. This is canceled by the prefactor exp[−ieR x+ǫ
x−ǫ dxµAµ] which will be unity
when the coincidence limit ǫ → 0 is taken. Of course, we can recover the locality of the
current operator in the coincidence limit,

ˆJ(x) = lim
ǫ→0

ˆJ(x; ǫ)

(2.7)

We can also separate the vacuum expectation value lim

ǫ→0h ˆJ (x; ǫ)i into the ǫ-dependent diver-
gent terms and the ǫ-independent ﬁnite terms as we will see below. This fact indicates that
the divergence has an ultraviolet (UV) nature and can be absorbed by renormalization of the
charge e and the ﬁeld redeﬁnition.

The mode decomposition of the quantized scalar ﬁeld is given by

– 4 –

that the separation in scale factor (a± 6= a) must be preserved during calculation, otherwise
it would lead to a wrong result. We have only a logarithmic divergence of the separation
to be absorbed by the renormalization of the charge and the gauge ﬁeld. In fact, we also
have direction dependent divergent terms such as (−∆η2 + |∆x|2)−2∆z. We can, however,
eliminate them by adopting a rule that the limit ∆z → 0 must be taken in advance whenever
the coincidence limit ǫ → 0 is taken.
2.3 Renormalization

The vacuum expectation value of the current operator must be placed at the right-hand side
of the semiclassical Maxwell equation F µν

Renormalization prescription is required to deal with divergence. In our set up, only
the z-component is relevant. We can use usual ansatz for renormalized ﬁeld AR z and charge
eR involving a divergent coeﬃcient C such as

;ν(x) = −h ˆJ µ(x)i.

AR z = CAz,

eR = C −1e,

(2.16)

or instead of renormalizing Az we can introduce renormalized electric ﬁeld strength ER =
CE. Note that combination of the charge and the ﬁeld is unchanged eRER = eE, and
hJz(e, E)i = C hJz(eR, ER)i. The minimal choice for C is found to be

C 2 = 1 +

e2
24π2 log ǫ.

(2.17)

(2.18)

This choice gets rid of only the log ǫ term from (2.15). We can subtract the terms proportional
to L from large parenthesis [··· ] in (2.15) in addition to it. So the form of C is given by

C 2 = 1 +

e2
24π2 {log ǫ + (ﬁnite terms)} .

Some Physical condition is required to determine the ﬁnite part in (2.18). We adopt the
requirement that the renormalized current must vanish in massive scalar limit (m2 ≫ E, H 2),

Thus we have reached the same expression as obtained by Kobayashi and Afshordi [22]

using the adiabatic regularization up to the second order.

3 Properties of the result

It is remarkable that our result agrees with the previous one [22], and worthwhile to list its
physical signiﬁcance for self-containedness. Note that the dimensionless current deﬁned as

J = J(L, M ) ≡ h ˆJzi
eaH 3 ,

(3.1)

is a function of L and M . The graph of J(L, M ) as a function of the electric ﬁeld strength
L is shown in Fig. 1 for diﬀerent values of the mass parameter M .

Figure 1. Absolute value of the renormalized current J = hJi /eaH 3 is shown as a function of
L = eE/H 2. Each line corresponds to diﬀerent mass parameter M = m/H. Negative current is
observed in L = 1 ∼ 10 for M = 0.001 case.

3.1 Limiting behaviors

First let us consider various limiting behaviors.

(3.3)

There is a strong M −2 enhancement for the small scalar mass. This is a four dimensional
analog of the two dimensional IR hyperconductivity reported in [20]. We can also see the
M −2 scaling for the massive scalar but the coeﬃcient is slightly changed.

The exponentially suppressed term (∝ e−2πM ) in the large mass regime must exist
naturally because the standard Bogoliubov calculation gives the number density of the scalar
particles in dS spacetime n ∼ H 4(e2πM − 1)−1 which means the exponential suppression of
heavy particles. Nevertheless, we also have inexplicable terms which are not protected by
exponential factor in the conductivity.

Of course, there is room for changing the renormalization ﬁxing without breaking the
condition hJziren → 0 for M → ∞. If one naively tried to remove the M −2 term in (3.3),
it would cause a huge IR correction and even worse negativity to the renormalized current.
Furthermore, if all the unprotected terms should be subtracted from the current J, the second
term in (3.2) would be left results in a discontinuity at M = √2. 1 It is also obvious that
σ would be negative for M ≫ 1 in such a treatment. For these reasons, we do not consider
changing the renormalization condition.
Note also that this 7/(72π2M 2) term corresponds to the fourth order adiabatic term.
The terms in (2.20) correspond to the zeroth and second order adiabatic subtraction terms.
We can expect that the formal inﬁnite order adiabatic subtraction of the terms proportional
to L (WKB is an asymptotic expansion) would result in the removal of the exponentially
unprotected behavior in massive limit.

where asymptotic analysis reveals that no O(H 0) term appears. The divergence H −1 is due
to the lack of the cosmic dilution in the Minkowski spacetime. The particles produced at

1 This mass parameter corresponds to the conformal coupling ξRφ2 in dS spacetime, ξ = 1/6 and R = 12H 2.
Thus this is conformally equivalent to a massless scalar ﬁeld in Minkowski spacetime. Thus this discontinuity
(or divergence) at M = √2 might be physically reasonable.

– 7 –

Figure 2. Conductivity of dS spacetime

t = −∞ contributes to the current expectation value forever, so H −1 must be replaced by
some regulator such as (t − t0) with t0 being the turn-on time of the electric ﬁeld. This
prescription is justiﬁed because the diﬀerentiation d
dη hJi is ﬁnite when H → 0. Note that
the conformal time η is identical to the cosmic time t in this limit as we are taking the scale
factor a = (1− Hη)−1. This behavior corresponds to the result obtained in Minkowski space.
This linear growth of the current in time was shown in [28].

3.2 Negativity of the current
Noteworthy is the existence of the negative current J < 0 around L ∼ O(1) for small mass
regime M . 10−3. Typical situation is depicted in Fig. 3. L = 0 is a trivial zero of J(L, M ).
Two more zeros of the current appear in L > 0 and J is negative between them.

The positive current causes negative backreaction to the background electric ﬁeld as
expected. The negative current conversely enhances the background electric ﬁeld. The
current-electric ﬁeld system can be seen as a sort of feedback system and stability analysis
is easy. The ﬁrst (nontrivial) zero of the current corresponds to the so-called diverging
point. No backreaction occurs at this point, however, small deviation from this point induces
positive feedback which enhances the deviation. The second zero (and also the trivial zero)
is a stable point of the system. Small deviations are pulled back to this point.

Note that negativity of the induced current does not mean fatal instability of the system,
as it occurs only in a ﬁnite range of the electric ﬁeld and the induced current recovers its
positivity as L increases. The position of the second zero is numerically given by L =
− 1
3 log M for M ≪ 1 indeed.
In Fig. 4, we show the position of the zeros of J(L, M ) in L-M plane, which also serves
as a phase diagram of the current versus electric ﬁeld. Each line represents the zeros of
the current. The lower (upper) line corresponds to the ﬁrst (second) zero of the current
J(L, M ). The negativity happens in the region between the two lines. There exists a critical
mass Mc ∼ 0.0033, the maximum value of the scalar mass which can cause the negativity
of the current. We also emphasize that the negativity is usually mild compared to the IR

Figure 3. Example of the negativity of the current J(L, M ). IR enhancement around L ∼ M is not
shown here (see the logarithmic plot in Fig. 1). There are three zeros of J, two of them (L = 0 and
L ∼ 13) are stable, the other (L ∼ 2.5) is unstable.

hyperconductivity which occurs coincidently and the J ∝ L2 behavior in the strong ﬁeld
regime as we mentioned in previous subsection.

sents the trajectory of stable points and the lower (orange) line represents that of diverging points.
The red dot represents the critical point (Lc, Mc) = (5.7, 0.0033).

Although we have convinced ourselves that the negative induced current is not dangerous
as we intuitively thought, its interpretation is another problem. We must remember that the
particle description is correct only in the semiclassical regime, say, L2 + M 2 ≫ 1. Naively
taken, small mass but large electric ﬁeld regime can satisfy this condition and should be

– 9 –

described well by the semiclassical approximation, but it turns out not to be the case. The
appearance of the exponentially unprotected terms in weak electric ﬁeld but massive limit
(3.3) is the counterpart of the breakdown of the semiclassical description.

4 Discussion

In this section, we try to clarify the intuitive physical interpretation of the results summarized
in the previous section.

We begin with the semiclassical description for the induced current hJzi. In the particle

picture, hJzi can be split into two parts (see also [20]) as
hJzi = Jpairs + Jvac,

(4.1)

where Jpairs is a contribution due to the kinetic motion of the semiclassical particles and given

by Jpairs = 2eR vdn (v is the velocity and dn is the diﬀerential number density of carriers).

Jvac is the vacuum current which ﬂows to satisfy the local current conservation low when the
particle pair is produced out of the vacuum. The vacuum current connects the pair particles.
In Minkowski spacetime, the positiveness of the semiclassical current is obvious. However,
it is not so trivial in de Sitter spacetime due to the dynamics of the charged particles and
the spacetime topology. When the charged particles move along the electric ﬁeld, Jpairs is
always positive, but they can move against the electric ﬁeld (in upstream direction) in de
Sitter spacetime. This is due to the eﬀect of the rapid cosmic expansion. Of course, Jpairs
itself is expected to be positive because the particle production in the usual (down-stream)
direction is more likely than that in the opposite (up-stream) direction even in de Sitter
spacetime. Another diﬀerence from Minkowski appears in Jvac. Since four-dimensional de
Sitter spacetime has R × S3 topology, there is a detour which links two spatially separated
points. Thus, the vacuum current can make a detour and contribute negatively, while the
vacuum current in a shortcut way is always positive. Since a scalar ﬁeld with a small mass
has a long Compton wavelength, it can detect the global structure of spacetime.
If this
explanation for the negative current is pertinent, the negativity of the induced current might
be found even in a lower dimensional setup such as quantum ﬁeld theory on a circle.

When it comes to the terms without the exponential mass suppression in (3.3), we
cannot make any satisfactory interpretations so far as they are contributions beyond those
obtained by the semiclassical approximation or the instanton analysis [29].

5 Conclusion

In the present paper, we have calculated the vacuum expectation value of a charged scalar
current in the presence of a constant homogeneous electric ﬁeld along z-direction in de Sitter
spacetime using the point-splitting regularization scheme in a covariant and gauge-invariant
manner. This enabled us to do renormalization explicitly in the equation of motion. The
only divergence we have encountered is the logarithmic divergence which can be absorbed
into the kinetic term of the gauge ﬁeld in a conventional fashion. In a previous calculation
done with the momentum cutoﬀ technique [22], there was also a quadratic divergence which
was an obstacle to the gauge-invariant renormalization. In [22], the adiabatic subtraction, in
which WKB expansion was adopted to imitate the large momentum behavior of the mode
function, was applied. Here we have imposed the renormalization condition (2.19) instead
of employing the adiabatic subtraction. Interestingly, the result of the minimal subtraction

eliminating only the terms in (2.20) and that with the adiabatic subtraction show the perfect
agreement. This remarkable fact strongly suggests the correctness of the result.

We have also investigated the properties and the consequences of the renormalized
current (2.21). We have found two kinds of the breakdown of the semiclassical approxi-
mation. One is the term which is not suppressed by the exponential factor e−2πm/H and
it appears in the massive and weak electric ﬁeld limit, eE/H 2 ≪ 1, m/H ≫ 1. The con-
ventional Bogoliubov calculation indicates that all the terms in this limit should be pro-
tected by this exponential factor. The limiting behavior of the (dimensionless) conductivity
σ = hJiren /(e2aHE)|E→0 in (3.3), however, contains the unprotected terms.
The other is the negativity of the renormalized current which shows up in tiny mass
regime m . 0.003H that has already been discovered by Kobayashi and Afshordi [22] using
the adiabatic regularization scheme. It is natural that one might think the negative current
of an artifact of the renormalization scheme. Indeed, the adiabatic subtraction scheme breaks
down in the IR limit because WKB (adiabatic) approximation is not correct in this regime
even though it removes the UV divergences. We have, however, found that the outcome has
nothing to do with the accuracy of the WKB approximation, so that we can say that such a
criticism does not apply. Therefore, we have to take these strange phenomena seriously.

It should be noted that the expression for the renormalized current (2.21) apparently
has a divergence in the massless limit. This is not the problem of our analysis, but merely
an outcome of the fact that the vacuum state for an exactly massless charged ﬁeld in an
electromagnetic background is unstable. Of course, there is no divergence in the large mass
limit by construction.

We have argued that the uncertainty of the renormalization in curved spacetime comes
from the lack of knowledge of the correct behaviors of the quantum ﬁelds in some asymptotic
region. The only reliable behavior is the asymptotics in Minkowski limit, but it does not
fully ﬁx the renormalization condition, although the semiclassical properties are reproduced
in this limit, namely, for the cases L ≫ 1 or H ≪ 1. Again, this is not the problem of our
analysis but rather originates in the lack of information in this curved spacetime. Conversely,
the choice of the renormalization condition does not aﬀect the behavior in the ﬂat spacetime.
