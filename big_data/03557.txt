Abstract

The domination number γ(H) of a hypergraph H = (V (H), E(H)) is the minimum
size of a subset D ⊂ V (H) of the vertices such that for every v ∈ V (H) \ D there exist
a vertex d ∈ D and an edge H ∈ E(H) with v, d ∈ H. We address the problem of
ﬁnding the minimum number n(k, γ) of vertices that a k-uniform hypergraph H can
have if γ(H) ≥ γ and H does not contain isolated vertices. We prove that

n(k, γ) = k + Θ(k1−1/γ)

and also consider the s-wise dominating and the distance-l dominating version of the
problem. In particular, we show that the minimum number ndc(k, γ, l) of vertices that
a connected k-uniform hypergraph with distance-l domination number γ can have is
roughly kγl

prescribed property? In most cases, size is measured by the number of edges, hyperedges,
sets, respectively, contained in the object, and the number of vertices is usually included in
the prescribed property. However, sometimes it can be interesting and even applicable to
consider problems about the minimum or maximum number of vertices [18, 19, 20].

The neighborhood 1 of a vertex v ∈ V (H) is the set Nv := {v} ∪(cid:83)
neighborhood of a set S ⊂ V (H) is deﬁned as N (S) :=(cid:83)

In the present paper we address the problem of ﬁnding the minimum number of vertices
in a k-uniform hypergraph that has large domination number. The domination number
γ(G) of a graph G, a widely studied notion (see [10], [11]), is the smallest size that a subset
D ⊂ V (G) of the vertices can have if every vertex v ∈ V (G) \ D has a neighbor in D.
We will be interested in the hypergraph version of this notion, which was investigated
ﬁrst in [1] and later studied in [2, 3, 4, 14, 16]. Let H = (V (H), E(H)) be a hypergraph.
E∈E(H) : v∈E E, and the
v∈S Nv. A set D ⊂ V (H) is called
a dominating set of H if D ∩ Nv (cid:54)= ∅ for all v ∈ V (H). Equivalently we can say that D is
a dominating set if and only if N (D) = V (H). The minimum size γ(H) of a dominating
set in a hypergraph H is the domination number of H. As all isolated vertices always are
contained in every dominating set, they can be eliminated in an obvious way, therefore we
restrict our attention to hypergraphs without isolates.

Let n(k, γ) be the minimum number of vertices that a k-uniform hypergraph with no
isolated vertices must contain if its domination number is at least γ. Beyond the trivial case
of n(k, 1) = k, the problem of determining n(k, γ) is natural and seems interesting enough to
be addressed on its own right; neverhteless, Gerbner et al. (Problem 17 in [8]) arrived from
a combinatorial search-theoretic framework at the particular problem of deciding whether
n(k, 3) ≥ 2k + 3 holds or not. We answer this problem in the negative, determining the
asymptotic behavior of n(k, γ) as a function of k for every ﬁxed γ, up to the exact growth
order of the second term. To state our result in full strength, we need to introduce two
generalizations of domination. For an integer s > 0 we call D ⊂ V (H) an s-dominating
set of H if |D ∩ Nv| ≥ s for all v ∈ V (H) \ D and we call D and s-tuple dominating set if
|D ∩ Nv| ≥ s for all v ∈ V (H). Note that dominating sets are exactly the 1-dominating sets
and 1-tuple dominating sets. As introduced in [7] and [9], respectively, the minimum size
γ(H, s) of an s-dominating set in a hypergraph H is the s-domination number of H and
the minimum size γ×(H, s) of an s-tuple dominating set in a hypergraph H is the s-tuple
domination number 2 of H. By deﬁnition, we have γ(H, s) ≤ γ×(H, s). For every pair γ, s of
integers with γ ≥ s, let n(k, γ, s) denote the minimum number of vertices that a k-uniform
hypergraph H must have if γ(H, s) ≥ γ holds and there exist no isolated vertices in H and

1In this paper we use the short term “neighborhood”, although this is called “closed neighborhood” in
the main part of the literature. We note that the inclusion of {v} in the deﬁnition of Nv may be omitted if
v is not an isolated vertex in H.

2The standard notation for s-tuple domination in the graph theory literature is γ×s(G), but for the
diﬀerent variants of domination in this paper we try to use notations which are similar to each other in their
form, this is why we put s in another position.

let n×(k, γ, s) denote the minimum number of vertices that a k-uniform hypergraph H must
have if γ(H, s) ≥ γ holds and there exist no isolated vertices. From the above, we have
n×(k, γ, s) ≤ n(k, γ, s).

Our main theorem about s-domination is the following.

Theorem 1.1. For every γ ≥ 2 and s ≥ 1 with γ > s we have

k + k1−1/(γ−s+1) ≤ n×(k, γ, s) ≤ n(k, γ, s) ≤ k + (4 + o(1))k1−1/(γ−s+1).

Another generalization of domination is distance-l domination, which was introduced by
Meir and Moon in [17]. This notion has been studied only for graphs so far. A good survey
of the results until 1997 is [12]. For more recent upper and lower bounds on the distance-l
domination number of graphs see [13] and [6].

if(cid:83)

In distance-l domination a vertex v dominates all vertices that are at distance at most
l from v. As the deﬁnition of distance in graphs involves paths, and paths in hypergraphs
can be deﬁned in several ways, distance-l domination could be addressed with each of those
deﬁnitions. But as we will remark in Section 4, only so-called ‘Berge paths’ oﬀer new
problems in our context. A Berge path of length l is a sequence v0, H1, v1, H2, v2, . . . , Hl, vl
with vi ∈ V (H) for i = 0, 1, ..., l and vi−1, vi ∈ Hi ∈ E(H) for i = 1, 2, ..., l. The distance
dH(u, v) of two vertices u, v ∈ V (H) is the length of a shortest Berge path from u to v. The
ball centered at u and of radius l consists of those vertices of H which are at distance at most
l from u; it will be denoted by Bl(u). We call D ⊂ V (H) a distance-l dominating set of H
u∈D Bl(u) = V (H). Equivalently we can say that D ⊂ V (H) is a distance-l dominating
set if and only if D ∩ Bl(v) (cid:54)= ∅ for all v ∈ V (H). Note that distance-1 dominating sets are
the usual dominating sets.
The minimum size of a distance-l dominating set in a hypergraph H is the distance-l
domination number γd(H, l). Let further nd(k, γ, l) denote the minimum number of vertices
that a k-uniform hypergraph H with no isolated vertices can contain if γd(H, l) ≥ γ holds.
The next proposition shows that nd(k, γ, l) does not depend on l once l ≥ 2 is supposed.
Proposition 1.2. For any k, l ≥ 2 and γ ≥ 1 we have nd(k, γ, l) = kγ, and the unique
extremal hypergraph consists of γ pairwise disjoint edges.

Proof. It is clear that the k-uniform hypergraph with just γ disjoint edges yields the upper
bound nd(k, γ, l) ≤ kγ.
We prove the lower bound by induction on γ. The case γ = 1 is trivial. So assume that
γ ≥ 2, and let H = (V (H), E(H)) be a k-uniform hypergraph with γd(H, l) ≥ γ. Consider
an arbitrary v ∈ V (H). Any vertex in N (Bl−1(v)) is distance-l dominated by v, therefore
the k-uniform hypergraph H(cid:48) induced by the edge set {H ∈ E(H) : H ∩ Bl−1(v) = ∅}
covers all vertices of H not distance-l dominated by v. The assumption γd(H, l) ≥ γ implies
γd(H(cid:48), l) ≥ γ − 1 and thus using that |Bl−1(v)| ≥ k for l ≥ 2 and by induction we obtain

|V (H)| = |Bl−1(v)| + |V (H(cid:48))| ≥ k + (γ − 1)k = γk.

3

Strict inequality holds whenever v has degree at least two.

The problem becomes more interesting when disconnected hypergraphs get excluded.
Hence, for k ≥ 2 and l, γ ≥ 1 let ndc(k, γ, l) denote the minimum number of vertices that a
k-uniform connected hypergraph H must contain if it has γd(H, l) ≥ γ.

To state our main result concerning ndc(k, γ, l) we need to deﬁne the following function:

(cid:40) l
2kγ + max{k, γ}
l+1
2 kγ

f (k, γ, l) :=

if l is odd.

(d) For any k ≥ 2 and γ ≥ 3 we have

kγ ≤ ndc(k, γ, 3) ≤ 2kγ.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: we prove Theorem 1.1 in Section 2,
and Theorem 1.3 in Section 3. Section 4 contains some ﬁnal remarks, also including a general
upper bound on γdc(H, l) as a function of l, the number of vertices, and the edge size.

2 Proof of Theorem 1.1

In this section we prove our bounds on n×(k, γ, s) and n(k, γ, s). First we verify the bound
k + k1−1/(γ−s+1) ≤ n×(k, γ, s). Observe that it is enough to prove the statement for s = 1,
since for any hypergraph H we have γ×(H, s) − (s − 1) ≥ γ×(H, 1) as for any s-tuple

4

dominating set D of H and a s(cid:48)-subset D(cid:48) of D the set D \ D(cid:48) (s − s(cid:48))-tuple dominates H.
Consequently

n×(k, γ, s) ≥ n×(k, γ − (s − 1), 1),

which implies the statement.
To see n(k, γ, 1) ≥ k + k1−1/γ let H be a k-uniform hypergraph with γ(H) ≥ γ ≥ 2. Let
G = (V (H), E) be the graph with (u, v) ∈ E if and only if no H ∈ E(H) contains both u
and v. The γ ≥ 2 condition means that for any vertex v ∈ V (H) there exists a u such that
no edge H ∈ E(H) contains both u and v, thus G does not contain any isolated vertices.
Let us write n = |V (H)| = |V (G)| = k + x and let t be the number of edges in a largest
matching M = (V (M ), E(M )) of G. Note that two distinct vertices u(cid:48), v(cid:48) outside V (M )
cannot be adjacent to two distinct endpoints u, v of an edge e ∈ E(M ) as the matching
(M \{e})∪{(u, u(cid:48)), (v, v(cid:48))} would contradict the maximality of M . Then either just one of u
and v has neighbors outside M , or none of them have any, or they share their unique neighbor
outside M . We denote by e(v) the (or an) endpoint of e whose ‘outside’ neighborhood in
this sense contains the ‘outside’ neighborhood of the other endpoint, and let de(v) denote the
size of Ne(v) \ V (M ).
By the deﬁnition of γ = γ×(H, 1) = γ(H, 1) and G we have that for any set Γ of γ − 1
vertices in V (G) there is a vertex v ∈ V (G) which is connected by edges in E(G) to all
the vertices of Γ. If Γ is a subset of V (G) \ V (M ), then the vertex which is adjacent to all
vertices of Γ must be in V (M ), since M is maximal. By this we obtain

Let e ∈ E(M ) be an edge with de(v) = d, and let H be any hyperedge H ∈ E(H) containing
e(v). Just as any hyperedge, H must avoid an endpoint of each edge in M , and H is disjoint
from Ne(v) \ V (M ). Therefore, we obtain k + x = n ≥ d + t + k and thus x ≥ d + t. Plugging
the previous inequality into this and rearranging yields:

To prove the bound n(k, γ, s) ≤ k + (4 + o(1))k1−1/(γ−s+1) we need a construction. This
involves projective geometries or linear vector spaces over ﬁnite ﬁelds. We will use the

We claim that γ(Hq,γ−s+1,t, s) ≥ γ. Suppose not and let D = DB ∪ DA be a minimal s-
dominating set of H = Hq,γ−s+1,t with DB = D ∩ B, DA = D \ DB and |D| < γ. As every
vertex d ∈ DB is contained in exactly one hyperedge Hd of H, each such d can be replaced
by a vertex d(cid:48) ∈ V (H) \ (D ∪ B) to obtain an s-dominating set D(cid:48) with D(cid:48) ⊆ V (H) \ B
and |D(cid:48)| = |D| < γ. Let D(cid:48) = {d1, d2, . . . , dp} and D(cid:48)(cid:48) = {d1, d2, . . . , dγ−s}. Then for

Z =(cid:84)

j:∃v∈D(cid:48)(cid:48)∩Aj

Uj we obtain

dim(Z) ≥ 1.

If E is a 1-subspace of Z, then the corresponding vertex b ∈ V (H) is not dominated by any
vertex d ∈ D(cid:48)(cid:48) and thus at most (s − 1)-dominated by D(cid:48), which is a contradiction.
Let us consider the other parameters of the above hypergraph: n = |V (Hq,γ−s+1,t)| =
m(t + 1) and Hq,γ−s+1,t is kq,γ−s+1,t-uniform with kq,γ−s+1,t = 1 + qγ−st, therefore if t = q,
then we obtain n = qγ−s+1 + 2(qγ−s + qγ−s−1 + ··· + q) + 1 and kγ = kq,γ−s+1,q = 1 + qγ−s+1,
thus we have n ≤ kγ−s+1 + 4k1−1/(γ−s+1)
. This ﬁnishes the proof of the upper bound if k is
one larger than the (γ − s + 1)st power of a prime.
Finally, let us consider the general case when k(cid:48) = 1 + qγ−s+1 + e with e < q(cid:48)γ−s+1− qγ−s+1
where q(cid:48) is the smallest prime larger than q.
It is well-known that q(cid:48) = q + o(q) and
q−γ+s+2(cid:101), all
thus e = o(qγ−s+1). Let C1, C2, . . . , Cq+1 be pairwise disjoint sets all of size (cid:100)
being disjoint from V (Hq,γ−s+1,q). We renumber the subspaces U1, U2, . . . , Um in such a way
that U1, U2, . . . , Uq+1 correspond to the dual of a (q + 1)-arc in P G(γ − s, q), i.e. every 1-
subspace E of V is contained in at most γ − s − 1 subspaces among U1, U2, . . . , Uq+1. (For
a general introduction to ﬁnite geometries, see [15].) Therefore, for any 1 ≤ i ≤ m, the sets

3 Distance domination

In this section we prove Theorem 1.3, the lower and upper bounds on ndc(k, γ, l).

3.1 The j-radius of trees

We start with some deﬁnitions and an auxiliary statement that we will use in the proof.

Deﬁnition. For positive integers a1, a2, ..., ah the spider graph, denoted by

is the tree on 1 +(cid:80)h

S(a1, a2, . . . , ah),

i=1 ai vertices which is obtained from h paths of lengths a1, a2, . . . , ah,
respectively, by identifying the ﬁrst vertices of those paths to a single vertex v of degree h.
Hence, S(a1, a2, . . . , ah) \ {v} has h connected components, say C1, C2, . . . , Ch, where each
Ci is a path Pai on ai vertices (for i = 1, 2, ..., h).

In a connected graph G = (V (G), E(G)), the excentricity of a vertex v ∈ V (G) is deﬁned

as

and let the radius of G is

excG(v) := max{dG(u, v) : u ∈ V (G)}

r(G) := min{excG(v) : v ∈ V (G)}.

More generally, for any ∅ (cid:54)= W ⊂ V (G) let us write

excG(W ) := max{min{dG(u, w) : w ∈ W} : u ∈ V (G)}

7

and for an integer j ≥ 1 let the j-radius of G be

rj(G) := min{excG(W ) : W ⊂ V (G),|W| ≤ j}.

Certainly we have r(G) = r1(G). Finally, let

rj(n) := max{rj(T ) : |V (T )| = n, T is a tree}.

The numerical bounds themselves in the next lemma concerning the radius of a tree are
folklore; for later use, however, we need a more detailed assertion which describes some
structural properties, too. Some bounds on the function rj(n) can be derived also from
results of Meir and Moon [17], but the following is a little sharper.
Lemma 3.1. Let n ≥ j be positive integers. Then we have

Moreover, r1(n) =(cid:6) n−1

(i) if n is even, then the only tree with r1(T ) = (cid:100) n−1
(ii) If n is odd and r1(T ) = (cid:100) n−1

2 (cid:101) holds, then T is a path Pn−1 with a pendant edge.
Furthermore, T contains two copies of Pn−1 if and only if T is either a path Pn or a fork
Fn. Otherwise T contains just one copy of Pn−1.

2 (cid:101) is the path Pn on n vertices.

Proof. Let us ﬁrst prove the statements about r1(n). Let T be an arbitrary tree on n vertices
and let v be a middle vertex of a longest path P in T . If P contains l vertices, then any
2 (cid:101) from v. This implies all assertions of the lemma if n is
vertex is at distance at most (cid:100) l−1
even. If n is odd, this implies that T must contain a path on n − 1 vertices and thus T is a
path Pn−1 and a pendant edge.

Let us now prove the general lower bound. We claim that

j+1 (cid:99)) belonging to
j+1(cid:99) from v and thus from U . This completes the proof

j+1(cid:99),(cid:98) n

To see the general upper bound, let T be any tree on n vertices. We will use the following

claim repeatedly.

Claim 3.2. Let m < n be two positive integers. Then in any tree T on n vertices there
exists a vertex v such that if C1, C2, . . . , Cs denote those components of T \ {v} whose all

vertices are at distance at most m from v, then(cid:80)s

i=1 |Ci| ≥ m holds.

Proof of Claim 3.2. Let P be a longest path of T . If P contains at most m vertices, then
any vertex can play the role of v. If P contains at least m + 1 vertices, then let v be the
(m + 1)st vertex from one end of P .

For t = 1, 2, . . . , j − 1 let mt = (cid:98) n+t−1

mt for t = 1, 2, . . . , j − 1 to obtain vt; and then set
Tt+1 := Tj \ ∪kt

i=1Ci,t,

j+1 (cid:99) and let T1 = T . We apply Claim 3.2 to Tt and

In this way we obtain a tree Tj of at most (cid:100)2 n

at most mt from vt. By the claim we also have(cid:80)kt

where the Ci,t (i = 1, 2, ..., kt) are the components of Tt \ {vt} whose vertices are at distance
i=1 |Ci,t| ≥ mt.
j+1(cid:101) vertices. Let vj be a vertex of Tj
(cid:101) from all vertices of Tj. Such a vertex exists by the result on
j+1(cid:101), which proves

within distance (cid:100)|V (Tj )|−1

3.2 Putting things together: the proof of Theorem 1.3

Let us ﬁrst prove the upper bounds of Theorem 1.3. To do so we introduce two types of
hypergraphs with distance-l domination number γ. The second construction will prove the
upper bounds of (b), (c), and (d).
If γ = 2, then the construction giving the smaller
number of vertices depends on the values of k and l. This is why we have the minimum of
two expressions in the upper bound of (a).

vertices which are not elements of(cid:83)2l(γ−1)+1

Construction 1:
For i = 1, . . . , 2l(γ − 1) + 1 let Ui be pairwise disjoint sets, and let vi and w be distinct
Ui. During Construction 1 all the indices will

be taken modulo 2l(γ − 1) + 1, e.g. we then have 2l(γ − 1) + 2 = 1.

following way. Let

for all i. We deﬁne a hypergraph H = (V (H), E(H)) in the

2l(γ−1)+1(cid:91)

V (H) :=

(Ui ∪ {vi}),

and let the hyperedges of H be

i=1

for i = 1, . . . , 2l(γ − 1) + 1. Then the size of V (H) is

Hi := Ui ∪ Ui+1 ∪ {vi}

(2l(γ − 1) + 1)(k + 1)

2

.

If k is even, let |U2i| = k

We deﬁne H with the vertex set

2 for i = 1, . . . , l(γ − 1) and |U2i+1| = k

2 − 1 for i = 0, . . . , l(γ − 1).

V (H) := {w} ∪ 2l(γ−1)+1(cid:91)

(Ui ∪ {vi}),

and with the edge set E(H) := {Hi | 1 ≤ i ≤ 2l(γ − 1) + 1}, where

i=1

Hi := Ui ∪ Ui+1 ∪ {vi}

if i = 1, . . . , 2l(γ − 1), and

if i = 2l(γ − 1) + 1. Then,

Hi := Ui ∪ Ui+1 ∪ {vi, w}

|V (H)| =

(2l(γ − 1) + 1)(k + 1)

(cid:24)(2l(γ − 1) + 1)(k + 1)

To see that γd(H, l) ≥ γ holds in both cases, observe the following facts:
• vertex vi distance-l dominates a vertex vj exactly for

j ∈ {i − l + 1, ..., i + l − 1},

• vertex w distance-l dominates a vj exactly for

j ∈ {2l(γ − 1) − l + 2, ..., 2l(γ − 1) + l},

• a vertex u ∈ Ui distance-l dominates a vj exactly for
j ∈ {i − l, ..., i + l − 1}.

10

So, every vertex in V (H) distance-l dominates at most 2l vertices vi. This yields γd(H, l) ≥ γ.

Construction 2:

This construction relies on the spider graph S = S(a1, a2, . . . , aγ) with all of the ai being
equal to (cid:98)l/2(cid:99). Let v be the only vertex of S with degree γ. Let u1, u2, . . . , uγ be the
γ be the vertices of S that are at distamce (cid:98)l/2(cid:99)
neighbors of v in S, and let u(cid:48)
from v.
Let W be a set of size max{k, γ}. Take a partition (W1, W2, . . . , Wγ) of W such that
|Wi| = (cid:98)|W|+i−1
(cid:99). Finally, for every u ∈ V (S) \ {v}, let Uu := Uu,1 ˙∪ Uu,2 be a set of size k
such that

2, . . . , u(cid:48)

1, u(cid:48)

γ

• u ∈ Uu,1 holds for all u ∈ V (S) \ {v},
• Uu ∩ Uu(cid:48) = ∅ holds for all u (cid:54)= u(cid:48) ∈ V (S) \ {v},
• Uu ∩ W = ∅ holds for all u ∈ V (S) \ {v},
• |Uu,1| = |Wi| for all those u ∈ V (S) \ {v} which lie in the same component of S \ {v}

as ui.

With the help of the previously deﬁned sets we construct a k-uniform hypergraph H in the
following way, depending on the parity of l:

Case I: l is even

Let the vertex set of H be V (H) = W ∪(cid:83)

u∈V (S)\{v} Uu. Thus we have
+ max{k, γ}.

|V (H)| =

klγ
2

The edge set E(H) contains the following four types of hyperedges:

1. all k-subsets of W , i.e. (cid:0)W

(cid:1) ⊂ E(H),

k

2. for all u ∈ V (S) \ {v}, we have Uu ∈ E(H),
3. for all i = 1, 2, . . . , γ let Wi ∪ Uui,2 ∈ E(H),
4. for every edge (u, u(cid:48)) = e ∈ E(S) with u, u(cid:48) (cid:54)= v if dS(u, v) < dS(u(cid:48), v) holds, then let

Uu,1 ∪ Uu(cid:48),2 ∈ E(H).

Clearly, H is connected due to(cid:0)W

(cid:1) ⊂ E(H). We claim that γd(H, l) ≥ γ holds. Indeed,
D ∩ (Wi ∪ (cid:91)

Uu) = ∅

k

if D ⊂ V (H) has size at most γ − 1, then there exists an i ≤ γ such that

u∈Ci

11

Figure 1: Construction 2 in case of even l

holds where Ci is the component of S \ {v} containing ui. Then u(cid:48)
1 + 2 l

2 = l + 1 from any vertex of D and thus u(cid:48)
Case II: l is odd

i is not distance l-dominated by D.

i is at distance at least

In addition to the sets deﬁned above, let Z1, Z2, . . . , Zγ be pairwise disjont sets of size
k − |Wi|, each of which is disjoint from all previously deﬁned sets. Let the vertex set of H
be

V (H) = W ∪ (cid:91)

u∈V (S)\{v}

Uu ∪ γ(cid:91)

i=1

Zi.

Thus we have

As for the edge set of H, there is a ﬁfth type of hyperedge:

5. for all 1 ≤ i ≤ γ let Uu(cid:48)

i,1 ∪ Zi ∈ E(H).

|V (H)| ≤ (cid:100) l
2

(cid:101)kγ.

The fact that γd(H, l) ≥ γ follows similarly as in the previous case, because for any (γ−1)-set
D ⊂ V (H) there exists an i such that any vertex z ∈ Zi is at distance at least l + 1 from D.

Let us now turn our attention to the lower bounds. We prove ﬁrst that of (a). Consider
a connected k-uniform hypergraph H with γd(H, l) ≥ 2. Let M be a maximal matching in

12

H obtained in the following way. Let

M1 := {H1}, I1 := {H ∈ E(H) \ {H1} : H ∩ H1 (cid:54)= ∅} and R0 := E(H) \ (M1 ∪ I1).

Then for s ≥ 2 we deﬁne a sequence Ms,Is,Rs of partitions of E(H) such that:

1. Ms is a matching,
2. every hyperedge in Is meets at least one hyperedge in Ms, and
3. all hyperedges in Rs are disjoint from all hyperedges in Ms.
If Ms,Is,Rs are deﬁned with Rs (cid:54)= ∅, then let Hs+1 ∈ Rs be a hyperedge such that
Hs+1 ∩ Is (cid:54)= ∅ for some Is ∈ Is. The existence of such Hs+1 follows from the assumption that
H is connected. Set

Ms+1 := Ms ∪ {Hs+1}, Is+1 := Is ∪ {R ∈ Rs \ {Hs+1} : R ∩ Hs+1 (cid:54)= ∅}

and

Rs+1 := E(H) \ (Ms+1 ∪ Is+1).

of M, the graph GM is connected. For a vertex v ∈(cid:83)

For the smallest positive t with Rt = ∅, we let M := Mt. Thus the size of M is t.
Now let us consider the auxiliary graph GM with vertex set M and e = {Hi, Hj} ∈
E(GM) if and only if there exists H ∈ H with H ∩ Hi (cid:54)= ∅ and H ∩ Hj (cid:54)= ∅. By the deﬁnition
H∈M H let Hv denote the only element
of M containing v.
Suppose that for a pair H, H(cid:48) ∈ M we have dGM(H, H(cid:48)) = r. Then for any pair of
vertices u ∈ H, v ∈ H(cid:48) we have dH(u, v) ≤ 1 + 2r. To see this, consider the sequence
H, He1, Hi1, He2, Hi2, . . . , Her, H(cid:48), where es is the sth edge in a shortest path from H to H(cid:48)
and His is the sth vertex (i.e. a hyperedge in H) in the same path. By the maximality of
M, for every vertex w of H there exists an edge Hw containing w and an edge H ∈ M with
Hw ∩ H (cid:54)= ∅, therefore by the observation above we have
dH(u, w) ≤ 2 + 2rGM(u)

for every u ∈(cid:83)

H∈M H and w ∈ V (H).

If t ≥ l + 1 holds, then |V (H)| ≥ kt ≥ k(l + 1), proving the desired lower bound.
Now suppose that t ≤ l − 2 or t = l − 1 with t being odd. As we have noted, GM is

connected and thus by Lemma 3.1 we obtain
r(GM) ≤

Therefore, there exists an H∗ ∈ M = V (GM) such that rGM(H∗) ≤ (cid:100) t−1
the above, for a vertex v ∈ H∗ we have

2 (cid:101) holds and so, by

dH(v, v(cid:48)) ≤ 2 + 2

13

for any vertex v(cid:48) ∈ V (H). So in this case a vertex v ∈ H∗ distance-l dominates H, contra-
dicting γd(H, l) ≥ 2.

If t = l − 1 and t is even, then let T be a spanning tree of GM. By Lemma 3.1 we obtain

that T is a path on t vertices. So we may assume that

E(GM) ⊃ {(Hi, Hi+1) : i = 1, . . . , t − 1}.

Let e = (Ht/2, Ht/2+1) and consider a vertex v ∈ Ht/2∩He. As for vertices v(cid:48) with Hv(cid:48)∩Hi (cid:54)= ∅
for some i > t/2, a shortest path in H between v and v(cid:48) need not contain Ht/2. Thus we
obtain that v distance-l dominates H, contradicting γd(H, l) ≥ 2.

Finally, it remains to prove the lower bound of (a) in case of t = l and thus it is enough to
H∈M H| ≥ k/2 holds. We may and will assume that the radius of GM is
2 (cid:101). Let T be a spanning tree of GM. By Lemma 3.1 we know that T is a path if l is even,
(cid:100) l−1
and T contains a path on l − 1 vertices if l is odd. We claim that even if l is odd, T must be
a path on t vertices. Indeed, otherwise any vertex v ∈ He distance-l dominates H where e
is the middle edge of a path on l − 1 vertices that is contained in T . This would contradict
γd(H, l) ≥ 2. By this we may assume that E(GM) ⊃ {(Hi, Hi+1) : i = 1, . . . , l − 1}.

prove that |V (H)\(cid:83)

Claim 3.3. We have the following:

(ii) There exist w, w(cid:48) ∈ V (H) \(cid:83)

(i) For any pair of edges e, e(cid:48) in T we have He ∩ He(cid:48) = ∅.

H∈M H and Hw, Hw(cid:48) ∈ E(H) with

w ∈ Hw and w(cid:48) ∈ Hw(cid:48),

such that Hw meets only H1 and Hw(cid:48) meets only Hl, moreover Hwand Hw(cid:48) are disjoint from
all the other H ∈ M and also from He for all e ∈ E(T ).
Proof of Claim. We have two cases depending on the parity of l.

Case I: l is even.
Now we prove (i) in this case. Suppose that Hei ∩ Hej (cid:54)= ∅ with ei = (Hi, Hi+1), ej =
If i < j ≤ l/2, then a vertex v ∈ Hel/2 ∩ Hl/2+1 distance-l dominates H,
(Hj, Hj+1).
contradicting γdist(H, l) ≥ 2.. Similarly, if i < j and j ≥ l/2, then a vertex v ∈ Hel/2 ∩ Hl/2
distance-l dominates H, contradicting γdist(H, l) ≥ 2. Also, if i < l/2 < j, then if l/2 − i ≤
j−l/2, then a vertex v from Hl/2−1∩Hel/2−1 distance-l dominates H, while if l/2−i ≥ j−l/2,
then a vertex v from Hl/2+2 ∩ Hel/2+1 distance-l dominates H, contradicting γdist(H, l) ≥ 2.
We are done with (i) in Case I.
H∈M H and Hw containing w, the
hyperedge Hw meets He for some e ∈ E(T ) or Hw meets some Hz with z ≥ 2. Then a vertex
in Hen/2 ∩ Hn/2+1 distance-l dominates H, contradicting γdist(H, l) ≥ 2. The existence of w(cid:48)
and Hw(cid:48) can be shown analogously. This proves (ii) in Case I.

To see (ii) suppose that, for every w ∈ V (H) \(cid:83)

14

Case II: l is odd.

that, for every w ∈ V (H) \(cid:83)
Note that Hw ∩ Hw(cid:48) ⊂ V (H) \(cid:83)

H∈M H and also Hw ∪ Hw(cid:48) ∪(cid:83)

The proof of this case is very similar to the previous one. Let us just show (ii). Suppose
H∈M H and Hw containing w, the hyperedge Hw meets He for
some e ∈ E(T ) or Hw meets some Hz with z ≥ 2. Then a vertex in He(cid:100)n/2(cid:101) ∩ H(cid:100)n/2(cid:101) distance-l
dominates H, contradicting γdist(H, l) ≥ 2.

e∈E(T ) He ⊂ V (H), and
thus writing I = |Hw ∩ Hw(cid:48)| we obtain |V (H)| ≥ max{lk + I, (l + 1)k − I} ≥ lk + k/2. This
ﬁnishes the proof of the lower bound of (a).

Next we prove the lower bound of (b). We will need the following lemma.

Lemma 3.4. For any γ, l ≥ 2, let t∗ denote smallest t with rγ−1(t) ≥ l−1

2 . Then we have

ndc(k, γ, l) ≥ t∗k.

Proof. Let H be a connected k-uniform hypergraph with γd(H, l) ≥ γ. Let M be a maximal
matching in H obtained as in the proof of the lower bound of part (a), and let us consider
the auxiliary graph GM. For a vertex v ∈ ∪H∈MH let Hv denote the only element of M
containing v. Let the size of M be t. We assume ﬁrst that t < t∗, what means rγ−1(t) < l−1
2 .
Suppose that for a pair H, H(cid:48) ∈ M we have dGM(H, H(cid:48)) = r. Then for any pair of
vertices u ∈ H, v ∈ H(cid:48) we have dH(u, v) ≤ 1 + 2r. To see this, consider the sequence
H, He1, Hi1, He2, Hi2, . . . , Her, H(cid:48), where es is the sth edge in a shortest path from H to H(cid:48)
and His is the sth vertex (i.e. a hyperedge in H) in the same path. Let U ⊂ M be a subset
of size γ − 1 with rGM(U) = rγ−1(GM) ≤ rγ−1(t), and let L ⊂ V (H) be a set containing one
vertex from each U ∈ U.
By the maximality of M, for every vertex w of H there exists an edge Hw containing
w and an edge H ∈ M with Hw ∩ H (cid:54)= ∅. Therefore by the observation above and by the
deﬁnition of U, there exists a U ∈ U and a vertex u ∈ U for which we have

dH(u, w) ≤ 2 + 2rGM(U ) ≤ 2 + 2rγ−1(t) < 2 + 2

l − 1
2

= l + 1.

This means that if t < t∗ holds, then the (γ − 1)-subset L distance-l dominates H. Therefore
M consists of at least t∗ hyperedges and thus |V (H)| ≥ t∗k holds.
The lower bound of (b) follows by applying Lemma 3.1 with j = γ − 1 together with
Lemma 3.4, noting that (cid:100) t

implies t

γ > l−1

2 − 1.

γ(cid:101) ≥ l−1

2

Finally, we prove the lower bound of (c) and (d). This will follow from the claim that
any maximal matching in the edge set E(H) of a connected hypergraph H with γd(H, 2) ≥ γ
has size at least γ. To see this suppose that M = {H1, H2, . . . , Hm} is a maximal matching

15

in E(H) and for any i = 1, 2, . . . , m let vi be a vertex of Hi. As any vertex v ∈ V (H) is
contained in a hyperedge Hv which, by maximality of M, intersects some Hi ∈ M, the set
D = {vi : i = 1, 2, . . . , m} distance-2 dominates H. Therefore m ≥ γ must hold as claimed.

4 Final remarks and open problems

We addressed the problem of ﬁnding the minimum number of vertices that a connected k-
uniform hypergraph with high domination number must contain, and we considered two main
variants of the problem. For the original notion of domination and for s-wise domination we
found general lower and upper bounds on n(k, γ, s) in which even the order of magnitude of
the second term matches. The natural open problem occurs: it can be of interest to ﬁnd the
constant coeﬃcient of this second term.

Theorem 1.3, our main result concerning distance domination determines the asymptotics
of ndc(k, γ, l) if k and γ are ﬁxed and l tends to inﬁnity, or if all three parameters tend to
inﬁnity. Closing the gap of roughly 2kγ between the upper and lower bounds remains an
interesting open problem.

We had a good reason to choose the notion of Berge paths in the deﬁnition of distance-l
domination. The most common other deﬁnitions of a path in hypergraphs are linear paths,
where two consecutive hyperedges of the path must share exactly one vertex (an even more
restrictive notion is a loose path) and tight paths where the vertices v1, v2, . . . , vk+l−1 of the
path should be chosen in such a way that the ith hyperedge of the path is {vi, vi+1, . . . , vi+k−1}
for all i = 1, 2, . . . , l. This implies that consecutive hyperedges of a tight path share k − 1
vertices. Note that in the construction showing the upper bound of Theorem 1.1 no pair of
hyperedges has intersection size 1 or k− 1, therefore the construction does not contain linear
or tight paths of length larger than 1 and thus distance domination would not diﬀer from
ordinary domination, had we used these notions of hypergraph paths to deﬁne distance.

There are various results on diﬀerent domination numbers of a hypergraph in the litera-
ture: on the s-domination number in [2], on the inverse domination number in [16], on the
total domination number in [5], and on the connection of the domination number with the
transversal number in [3], [4]. Let us ﬁnish with the following theorem that can be obtained
simply by rearranging the lower bound of Theorem 1.3. In the style of Meir and Moon [17],
it uses only the size of the vertex set, the prescribed distance bound l, and the uniformity
of H.
Theorem 4.1. If H is a connected k-uniform hypegraph with |V (H)| = n, then

(cid:40) n
k · 2
l−3

k
n

γdc(H, l) ≤

if l = 2, 3 or 4,
if l > 4.

It remains an open problem to make these upper bounds tight.
