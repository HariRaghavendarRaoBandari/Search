Radio galaxies are active galactic nuclei (AGN) containing supermassive black holes with mis-
aligned relativistic jets. Centaurus A (Cen A) is the closest known γ-ray emitting radio galaxy.
Here, we report the discovery of a hardening in the Fermi-LAT γ-ray spectrum of the core of Cen
A above 2.4 GeV, at a signiﬁcance of 5σ as well as evidence for variability below 2.4 GeV at 99%.
These properties strongly support the hypothesis that the low energy component originates from
leptons in the jet while the additional source of very high energy particles near the core of Cen A
must originate from a diﬀerent cosmic ray population. We show for the ﬁrst time that the observed
γ-ray spectrum is compatible with either a very large localized enhancement (referred to as a spike)
in the dark matter halo proﬁle or a population of millisecond pulsars. A third explanation could
be nevertheless the presence of a hadronic component injected by the jet. Our work constitutes
the ﬁrst robust indication of new γ-ray production mechanisms in active galaxies and could provide
tantalizing ﬁrst evidence for the clustering of heavy dark matter particles around black holes.

INTRODUCTION

II. ANALYSIS

Due to its proximity [1] and the oﬀ-axis nature of its
jet, Cen A has been extensively studied at all wave-
lengths, including at γ-ray energies, where it has been
found to emit radiation from 30 MeV to about 5 TeV [2–
4]. A bright γ-ray core in Cen A was conﬁrmed by obser-
vations with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board
the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope [4] and a possi-
ble hardening of the gamma-ray emission above 4 GeV
was hinted by the authors of [5]. In addition, the Fermi -
LAT observations revealed an extended γ-ray emission
spatially coincident with Cen A’s giant radio lobes [6].
Both core and lobe emissions appeared to have similar
luminosities, and neither showed variability in their ﬂux.
This is at odds with observations of other prominent γ-
ray bright radio galaxies, such as M87 and NGC 1275,
whose ﬂux varies on very short timescales (as little as
days) [7, 8].

In this letter, we focus on the core emission of Cen A,
taking advantage of the improvements aﬀorded by the
new pass8 event characterisation of the Fermi -LAT data.
Using a maximum likelihood analysis and 7.5 years of
LAT data, we determine the 0.1 − 300 GeV γ-ray spec-
trum in the central part of Cen A with unprecedented
sensitivity and precision.

After establishing in Section II a statistically signiﬁ-
cant hardening of the high energy γ-ray emission in the
core of Cen A and ﬁnding evidence for variability of the
low energy component, we study in Section III two pos-
sible interpretations. One involves a spike in the dark
matter density proﬁle and the other one millisecond pul-
sars. We also discuss a third hypothesis, namely injected
protons by the jet before concluding in Section IV .

In the likelihood analysis, we modelled both the Galac-
tic and extragalactic diﬀuse emission, along with all
nearby extended and point sources as deﬁned by the third
Fermi -LAT source catalogue (3FGL). Cen A itself was
modelled as a point source coincident with the Cen A core
position (taken from the 3FGL), and a spatially extended
emission as deﬁned by the Fermi -LAT collaboration (see
the supporting online material for more details). The re-
sulting spectrum can be seen in Figure 1, and exhibits a
clear hardening above ∼ 2 GeV.
To characterise the existence of possible spectral fea-
tures, the 0.1 − 300 GeV spectrum was ﬁtted with both
power-law and broken power-law spectral models. Our
analysis shows that the broken power law is preferred
over the power law at a statistically signiﬁcant level
(test statistic greater than 28), which equates to a sig-
niﬁcance slightly greater than 5σ. The best-ﬁt bro-
ken power law has a break energy of Ebreak = 2.420 ±
0.003stat(+0.500
−0.062)sys GeV, with a spectral index of Γ1 =
−2.766±0.001stat(+0.063
−0.083)sys in the low energy regime and
a spectral index of Γ2 = −2.282 ± 0.014stat (+0.075
−0.000)sys
above the break energy. We note that extrapolating the
single power law found at low energy to the HESS ener-
gies would under predict the ﬂux above 250 GeV by an
order of magnitude, while the broken power law model
allows us to reconcile our Fermi -LAT spectrum with pre-
vious HESS observations.

Deconvolving the two spectral components aforemen-
tioned, we ﬁnd evidence that the γ-ray ﬂux above and be-
low the break energy originates from two diﬀerent source
populations. The γ-ray ﬂux below the 2.4 GeV spec-
tral break energy is inconsistent with a constant ﬂux at

III.

INTERPRETATION

There is a limited number of explanations for the non
variable emission above 2.4 GeV [10]. Here we exam-
ine the case of dark matter (DM), millisecond pulsars
(MSPs) and protons injected by the jet. We disregard
pulsar-like magnetospheric acceleration mechanisms of
electrons since these models attribute the entire MeV-
GeV γ-ray ﬂux to curvature radiation from the same
lepton population [11], which is inconsistent with both
the spectral break and the lack of ﬂux variability above
2.4 GeV. Moreover these magnetospheric models predict
that inverse-Compton luminosity, LIC, is proportional to
the supermassive blackhole mass, MBH, which is not ob-
served across the mass range of prominent γ-ray bright
radio galaxies [8].

A. Dark Matter

Dark matter (DM), as yet undetected, is a central ex-
planation for structure formation, the stability of galax-
ies and the acoustic peaks of the Cosmological Microwave
Background [12]. Most DM models assume annihilation
into lighter (Standard Model) particles but the nature
of DM is still an open question. While it is established
that DM agglomerates in the cores of galaxies, its den-
sity proﬁle near the central black hole (BH) is yet to
be characterised. Theoretical models predict that stellar
dynamical heating smooths out the DM density (produc-
ing a core), most notably in dwarf galaxies and, on the
other hand, considerably increases it (producing a spike)
in massive galaxies.
In either case, DM annihilations
should produce high energy cosmic rays in the central
parts of galaxies. The decay or hadronisation of the par-
ticles injected by the DM is expected to produce γ-rays
at an energy smaller than or equal to the DM mass (as-
suming they are charged and unstable)1. Here we exam-
ine whether this prompt emission is suﬃcient to explain
the anomalous spectral component between 2.4 GeV and
∼ 5 TeV.

In our analysis, the DM mass and annihilation cross-
section as well as the normalisation and slope of the spec-
tral emission below 2.4 GeV are free parameters. We
consider DM self-annihilations into leptons or quarks and
test two DM density proﬁles, the NFW proﬁle ρ(r) ∝ r−1
[16], and ρ(r) ∝ r−7/3 corresponding to a central DM
spike [17]. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2 (see the
supporting online material for more details), our best ﬁt
favours a DM candidate with a mass of 3 TeV, annihi-
lating into a pair of top and anti-top quarks (t¯t) with
cross-section σv (cid:39) 1.6 × 10−32 cm3s−1, and a spike in

1 Here we consider only prompt emission. We disregard any accel-
eration [13] or propagation processes [14, 15] that could distort
the prompt spectrum.

FIG. 1. The 0.1 to 300 GeV spectrum of Cen A’s core, as seen
by the Fermi-LAT detector. The broken power-law model,
shown in blue, is preferred over the power law model, shown
in red, with a signiﬁcance > 5σ. The grey histogram, with
the right hand y axis, shows the TS value for each spectral
bin. The bin with a TS< 25, is replaced with an upper limit
at 95% conﬁdence level.

99% level of conﬁdence, suggesting that the low energy
component of the γ-ray ﬂux in Cen A’s core is variable.
Conversely, the emission above 2.4 GeV is consistent with
a constant γ-ray ﬂux. Assuming isotropic γ-ray emission
and a luminosity distance of 3.8 Mpc, we ﬁnd that the
luminosities (L) of the low and high energy components
are comparable. We obtain L ≈ 9.9 × 1038 erg s−1 and
L ≈ 8.4 × 1038 erg s−1, respectively.

The hardening of the γ-ray spectrum above 2.4 GeV
reported here conﬁrms the trend that was suspected in
Ref. [5]. However the signiﬁcance of the hardening now
amounts to 5σ instead of the ∼ 2σ as obtained in Ref. [5].
Unlike in Ref. [5] though, we now have evidence for the
variability of the ﬂux associated with the low energy com-
ponent. Combining the two sets of information thus sug-
gests a jet origin for the low energy component and estab-
lishes a new production mechanism of high energy γ-rays
in the core of Cen A at 5 σ conﬁdence level.

Indeed, previous explanations of the γ-ray emission be-
low 10 GeV relied on a single zone population of relativis-
tic electrons within the AGN jet that would up-scatter
the synchrotron photon ﬁeld via the inverse Compton
process [4], usually cited as the synchrotron self-Compton
(SSC) model. However, the spectral hardening above
2.4 GeV is inconsistent with the SSC model predictions
(see the supporting online material), especially given the
latest X-ray observations [9], and so is the lack of vari-
ability above 2.4 GeV. Indeed, high energy electrons are
expected to lose energy quickly and generate ﬂux vari-
ability above the break energy, which is not observed.

γ-ray emission from DM prompt emission in an AGN
was ﬁrst studied in [15], our work consitutes the ﬁrst ev-
idence that γ-ray astronomy observations have the mean
to probe an anomalously high concentration of DM in
the very inner core of AGNs. In addition, we note that
the slope associated with the low energy contribution is
about 2.77, which is remarkably consistent with relativis-
tic Fermi acceleration in presence of shock compressed
turbulence [18], and supports the hypothesis that the low
energy emission has a jet origin.

The ﬁt corresponding to annihilations into t¯t gives
χ2 = 1.7 (while annihilations into a pair of bottom and
anti-bottom quark ﬁnal states gives χ2 = 3), for 11 spec-
tral data points2 and 4 free parameters (mDM, σv and the
normalisation and the slope of the power law spectrum
below 2.4 GeV). We ﬁnd a χ2/d.o.f = 0.24 which illus-
trates a remarkably good ﬁt and suggests that it is domi-
nated by statistical errors. The hypothesis of a NFW pro-
ﬁle with a thermal cross-section of σv (cid:39) 3×10−26 cm3s−1
is excluded because the ﬂux would be too strongly sup-
pressed (see the supporting online material).
Our best-ﬁt annihilation cross-section of the order of
σv (cid:39) 1.6 × 10−32 cm3s−1 is far too small to explain
the observed fraction of DM in the Universe. But this
might simply be revealing the existence of a rich dark
sector with several (non thermal) DM particles [19, 20]3,
or a combination of velocity-dependent and independent
terms in the annihilation cross section4. Either way, our
ﬁndings would suggest the existence of heavy DM par-
ticles exchanging at least one heavy particle mediator.
Such a mediator could be compatible with current hints
of a 750 GeV boson at LHC (though our best ﬁt requires
hadronic processes, which may be inconsistent with LHC
ﬁndings) [22].

B. Milli second pulsars

An alternative explanation to the DM model is mil-
lisecond pulsars (MSPs). These are rapidly rotating neu-
tron stars which have been observed mostly in globular
clusters. They are believed to spin up to millisecond peri-
ods due to frequent interactions with neighbouring stars
(e.g. by angular momentum accretion from a binary com-
panion). For this very reason, they are expected to form
in high stellar density environments, including the cen-
tral parsec around the Milky Way Galactic centre (GC),

FIG. 2. The upper panel shows the best ﬁt that we obtain by
assuming a single power law plus the prompt emission from
heavy DM particles annihilating into a pair of top quarks and
a spike in the DM density proﬁle. Middle panel assumes a
population of MSPs plus a power law. The bottom panel as-
sumes a power law, a population of MSPs and a DM candidate
of 30 TeV plus a spike.

2 The points are taken from our Fermi-LAT analysis and the ﬁrst
three data points from HESS observations [3]; see supporting
online material for details.

3 Our estimate assumes a unique DM candidate. Sub-component
DM particles might require eﬃcient co-annihilation processes,
see e.g. [21].

4 We note that there is a degeneracy between the annihilation
cross-section and the spike characteristics (normalisation, size,
power law index) which could aﬀect our estimates.

where the density is considerably higher than in globular
clusters.

MSPs, along with dark matter, are currently the lead-
ing explanations for the low energy γ-ray excess which
has been observed in the central region of the Milky
Way e.g.
It is estimated that around one to ten
thousand MSPs are needed to explain the GeV excess

[23].

The production mechanism of high en-
ergy γ-rays from MSPs involves electron-positron pairs
that may eventually be accelerated, radiate and produce
more electron-positron pairs [25]. This should lead to a
spectral feature at GeV energies. However the resulting
γ-ray signature can be broadened up to TeV energies by
inverse Compton processes [26], when the electrons accel-
erated by MSP winds up-scatter the ambient soft photon
ﬁeld (from e.g. UV and IR bands). Two critical assump-
tions for these estimates are an electron injection spec-
trum extending to a few tens of TeV and a large enough
interstellar radiation ﬁeld for the inverse Compton losses
to dominate over synchrotron losses. Here we use the
same propagation technique as for the Milky Way e.g.
[27], see online supporting material. For the magnetic
ﬁeld, we assume a constant value of 10 µG constrained
by Chandra limits on synchrotron radiation from high en-
ergy electron-positron pairs and use a conservative power
law, ρMSP ∝ r−1.2, for the MSP density proﬁle (consis-
tent with the GC γ-ray excess). As for the DM analysis,
we keep the normalisation and slope of the jet contribu-
tion as free parameters.
Assuming MSPs only leads to the ﬁt shown in the mid-
dle panel of Fig. 2, and a χ2 (cid:39) 10, that is χ2/d.o.f (cid:39) 1.4.
This ﬁt is only slightly improved by the addition of a
DM component at very high energy, as shown in the last
panel of Fig. 2 where we assumed a 30 TeV DM candi-
date annihilating into tau leptons. While the reduced χ2
is good, the poor knowledge of the MSPs density proﬁle,
the soft-photon ﬁeld and our rather crude model of the
magnetic ﬁeld severely limits our interpretation of the
goodness of the ﬁt.

C. Diﬀused protons

Another explanation is that both γ-ray core emissions
revealed in this letter originate from the jet in Cen A,
but are due to two diﬀerent cosmic ray populations. In
an analysis of the very high energy γ-ray spectrum of the
Milky Way’s central region, Ref [28] showed that accel-
erated protons from the jet could travel away from our
Galactic centre, Sgr A(cid:63), and emit enough γ-rays to ex-
plain the steady Milky Way spectrum up to a few TeV.
Probing this hypothesis in the case of Cen A requires

4

a much better knowledge of the diﬀusive zone and cos-
mic ray propagation parameters in AGNs than currently
available. Yet, in light of ref. [28], further evidence that
the jet is the dominant source of γ-ray emission in the
core of Cen A would strengthen claims that the Milky
Way has been an active galaxy in the past [29, 30]. The
study of the morphology of Cen A’s core emission will
thus be critical to answer this question.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this letter, we report a 5 σ evidence for a hardening
of the Fermi -LAT γ-ray spectrum and show that either
heavy DM particles or a population of MSPs could ex-
plain this high energy spectral feature. While we cannot
rule out that the jet itself is at the origin of the harden-
ing of the spectrum, the lack of variability of the emission
above 2.4 GeV argues against jet-induced leptonic models
(such as SSC). Hence, at the very least, our results are a
strong indication that the modelling of γ-ray production
mechanisms in active galaxies needs to be modiﬁed.

Our ﬁndings hint at new physics inside objects like Cen
A or astrophysical objects that are rarely detected out-
side our Galaxy. Therefore the precise modelling of cos-
mic ray propagation, together with observations of Cen
A’s γ-ray spectrum at TeV energies by HESS and the
Cherenkov Telescope Array, will be critical for determin-
ing the origin of the spectral break.

A DM explanation would reveal the existence of par-
ticles beyond the standard model of particle physics as
well as spikes in the DM proﬁle. While the existence of
spikes is highly debated, Cen A is dynamically young,
so such an enhancement may survive nuclear star cluster
dynamics. If conﬁrmed by other observations, our case
for a boost of the DM annihilation signal will constitute
the ﬁrst evidence that DM clusters around black holes,
and have central implications for our understanding of
the feedback mechanisms between ordinary matter and
DM in galactic cores.

Likewise, if the spectral hardening of Cen A’s core re-
ported here is due to a population of MSPs, then the
γ-ray spectrum of Cen A constitutes the ﬁrst insights
into the pulsar population in another galaxy. Either way,
these ﬁndings open up a new window on the physics of
the cores of active galaxies and provide the prospect of
more exciting discoveries.
