and extended to the complex plane via analytic continuation. Let sn = σn + itn, tn > 0, denote the sequence of
nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the upper halfplane ordered according to nondecreasing ordinates.
We demonstrate that, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, the Ces`aro means of the sequence Fsn(a) converge to the
ﬁrst harmonic exp(2πia) in the sense of periodic distributions. This reveals a natural broadband structure of the
pure tone. The proof involves Fujii’s reﬁnement of the classical Landau theorem related to the uniform distribution
modulo one of the nontrivial zeros of ζ.

Introduction

The periodized zeta function is deﬁned via the Dirichlet series:

∞(cid:88)

k=1

Fs(a) = F (s, a) =

e2πika

ks

a ∈ (0, 1],

,

(1)

where s = σ + it is a complex variable. When convenient we will identify the segment (0, 1] with the unit circle T
via a (cid:55)→ exp(2πia). Note that whenever σ > 1 the series converges absolutely and uniformly in a, and hence Fs is
continuous on T. Moreover, as is well known, for any ﬁxed a ∈ (0, 1] the function s (cid:55)→ F (s, a) can be extended into
the half plane σ ≤ 1 via analytic continuation; the Riemann zeta function is the particular case ζ(s) = F (s, 1). In
this way it is also seen that Fs(a) is well deﬁned for all s and all a ∈ (0, 1)1. Let sn = σn + itn, n ∈ N, be the
sequence of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the upper half plane, ordered so that 0 < tn ≤ tn+1.
It is known that 0 < σn < 1 for all n. Motivated by numerical evidence, see Fig. 1, we hypothesise that

a.e. in (0, 1].

The purpose of this article is to discuss the broader ramiﬁcations of this hypothesis and bring to light additional
supporting arguments. In particular, we demonstrate convergence in the sense of distributions on T, see Theorem 2
in Section 3. Our proof relies on a calculation of the Fourier coeﬃcients of Fs for s in the critical strip, see Theorem
1 in Section 2. It also involves a careful estimate pertaining to the distribution of nontrivial zeros of the Riemann
zeta function that was obtained by Fujii, [6], under the assumption of the Riemann Hypothesis (R.H.). In the
closing sections we brieﬂy discuss some new perspectives in harmonic analysis that the highlighted phenomenon
appears to suggest, see Subsection 4.1. We also describe the numerical experiment that is critically important to
the proposed hypothesis, see Subsection 4.2.

1Note that F1(1) is not deﬁned as it corresponds to the pole of ζ.

2 The Fourier coeﬃcients of Fs in the critical strip
Recall that for any f ∈ Lp[0, 1] with p ≥ 1 its Fourier coeﬃcients are deﬁned via the Lebesgue integral to be:

ˆf (k) =

f (a)e−2πika da,

k ∈ Z.

1(cid:90)

0

(cid:26) k−s, k ≥ 1

k ≤ 0

0,

ˆFs(k) =

Since (e2πik . )k∈Z furnishes an orthonormal basis in L2[0, 1] it follows directly from (1) that Fs ∈ L2[0, 1] whenever
σ > 1/2 and, in addition,

provided σ > 1/2.

(2)

Moreover, in this case the series in (1) converges to Fs in the L2 norm.

Our ﬁrst goal is to calculate the Fourier coeﬃcients of Fs when 0 < σ < 1. Of course, a successful calculation
should reproduce (2) when 1/2 < σ < 1. We begin by invoking the Hurwitz zeta function, ζ(s, a), which is related
to Fs(a) via an explicit formula discussed below, (13). It is at ﬁrst deﬁned in the half-plane σ > 1 by

ζ(s, a) =

1
as +

(n + a)s ,

a ∈ (0, 1].

(3)

∞(cid:88)

n=1

Note that the series on the right converges absolutely and uniformly and therefore deﬁnes a continuous function
of a ∈ [0, 1], while the ﬁrst term on the right is merely continuous in (0, 1]. The analytic continuation of ζ(s, a) to
the entire s-plane is given by (see Theorem 12.3 in [1]):

where Γ is the gamma function and

I(s, a) =

1
2πi

is a contour integral over C = C1 ∪ C2 ∪ C3 with

ζ(s, a) = Γ(1 − s)I(s, a)

(for all s)

(5)

C1 : z = re−iπ, c ≤ r < ∞;

C2 : z = ceiθ,−π ≤ θ ≤ π;

C3 : z = reiπ, c ≤ r < ∞.

In other words, the contour C runs along the real axis from negative inﬁnity to the point −c, where c is arbitrary
as long as 0 < c < 2π, then circles counterclockwise around the origin and ﬁnally goes back to negative inﬁnity
along the same path. Thus, zs means rse−iπs on C1 and rseiπs on C2. It is well known that s (cid:55)→ I(s, a) is an entire
function of s (for any ﬁxed a ∈ (0, 1]). In consequence ζ(s, a) is analytic for all s except for a simple pole at s = 1
with residue 1. The argument used in the proof of these facts, see [1], shows also that the function is smooth with
respect to a in (0, 1]. Indeed, it suﬃces to observe that the integral converges uniformly with respect to a ∈ [, 1].
Next, we ﬁnd the Fourier coeﬃcients of a (cid:55)→ I(s, a) when σ < 1 (i.e. in the critical strip as well as in the left
half-plane). Recall that c < 2π. First, assume k (cid:54)= 0. In this case (5) yields

Note that the contour with reversed orientation, i.e. −C, encircles the point z = 2πik counterclockwise. The
integral converges because σ < 1. Since the contour leaves the branching point z = 0 of z (cid:55)→ zs−1 on the outside
the integral is evaluated the same way as for a meromorphic integrand. Note that z = 2πik is the only singularity

of the integrand inside the contour, so that the contour integral over C may be replaced by a contour integral over
|z − 2πik| = , hence (8)2. The interchange of the two integrals in (6) is allowed by the Fubini Theorem, because
the double integral converges absolutely for every s. Indeed, it suﬃces to show that one of the iterated integrals
converges absolutely. Let z = x + iy; we have

and an analogous inequality with dx replaced by dy. Consider

The integrand is a smooth function on the compact circle C2. Indeed, (ex − 1)/x is smooth at x = 0 while |1 − ez|
is bounded below by a positive constant. This means that this part’s contribution is ﬁnite. On C1 and C3 we have
z = x = −r with r ≥ c, and the integrand is bounded by eπ|t|rσ−2 and, since σ < 1, these integrals converge. This
justiﬁes the interchange of the integrals. In addition, the same argument shows that a (cid:55)→ I(s, a) is in L1[0, 1]; see
also (10) and the remark that follows.
Second, consider the case k = 0. Proceeding as in lines (6) and (7) one can represent ˆI(s, 0) as a contour integral
over C, then notice that the integrand is regular outside the contour, which shows that ˆI(s, 0) = 0. Alternatively,
this can be observed via an explicit integration over the three parts of the contour.

By virtue of (4) we also have ζ(s, .) ∈ L1[0, 1], and

ˆζ(s, 0) = 0, ˆζ(s, k) = Γ(1 − s)(2πik)s−1 for k ∈ Z \ {0}

(σ < 1).

(9)

For clarity we emphasize the interpretation of the complex powers, namely:

(cid:26) (2πk)s−1 ei π(s−1)/2,

(2πik)s−1 =

k > 0
(2π|k|)s−1 e−i π(s−1)/2, k < 0.

The function a (cid:55)→ ζ(s, a) has a singularity at the left end-point of the unit interval. This singulary is described
by the following estimate, see Theorem 12.23, [1]. First, on the right from the critical strip (i.e. for σ > 1) the
distance |ζ(s, a) − a−s| is bounded by the constant ζ(σ). Second, if 1 − δ ≤ σ ≤ 2 for some δ ∈ (0, 1), then

(10)
where the constant A(δ) depends on δ but not on s. This implies that in fact ζ(s, .) ∈ Lp[0, 1] whenever 1 ≤ p < 1/σ
with 0 < σ < 1 (and |t| > 1).

|ζ(s, a) − a−s| ≤ A(δ)|t|δ

for |t| > 1,

We are now in a position to deduce the following:

Theorem 1. For an arbitrary s ∈ {0 < σ < 1, |t| > 1} we have Fs ∈ C∞(0, 1) and Fs ∈ Lp[0, 1] whenever
1 ≤ p < 1/(1 − σ). Moreover,

2 The latter integral may also be evaluated directly via an application of the generalized binomial formula

Proof. We invoke the Hurwitz formula3:

Fs(a) = i(2π)s−1e−πis/2Γ(1 − s)(cid:8)ζ(1 − s, a) − eπisζ(1 − s, 1 − a)(cid:9)

(s ∈ C, 0 < a < 1).

(13)

In light of (10) it is now clear that Fs ∈ Lp[0, 1] whenever 1 ≤ p < 1/(1 − σ) with 0 < σ < 1 (and |t| > 1).
In light of (2) it suﬃces to calculate the Fourier coeﬃcients for 0 < σ < 1. These are obtained by substituting
(9) into (13), observing that if g(a) = f (1 − a) then ˆg(k) = ˆf (−k), as well as making use of Euler’s formula
Γ(s)Γ(1 − s) = π/ sin (πs). This proves (11).
To prove (12) we make use of the fact that Fs is smooth in [, 1 − ] for small  > 0. Let us ﬁx an arbitrary
a ∈ (0, 1). There is a neighbourhood a ∈ [, 1− ] where the function is of bounded variation. It is well known that
this implies convergence of the Fourier series at a, see [3], Chapter 104. (cid:3)

Remark 1. We bring to the reader’s attention consistency of (11) with (2).
In a way we have come a full
circle starting from deﬁnition (1) and ending with an identically looking (12). While convergence in (12) is only
conditional for s is in the critical strip, it is a quite gratifying to see that the series returns the value of the function
Fs(a) everywhere in (0, 1). We note that Fs is not only smooth in (0, 1) but, in fact, it is analytic. Indeed, consider

˜Fs(z) =

k−szk

for complex z.

∞(cid:88)

k=1

1(cid:90)

It is straightforward that for s in the critical strip the radius of convergence of this series is 1, which means that
the function ˜Fs has at least one pole on the unit circle. On the other hand, by Abel’s theorem ˜Fs(z) → Fs(a) when
z → exp(2πia) within a Stolz angle, provided Fs(a) is ﬁnite. Thus, the only pole of ˜Fs occurs at z = 1, and the
function is analytic in the neighbourhood of any other point on the unit circle, where it coincides with Fs.
Remark 2. Recall that the convolution of two functions f, g ∈ L1[0, 1] is deﬁned via

f (cid:63) g(x) =

f (x − y)g(y)dy

It is a classical fact, [3], that f (cid:63) g ∈ L1[0, 1] and (f (cid:63) g)ˆ(k) = ˆf (k) ˆg(k). Theorem 1 together with (2) imply that
the family of functions {Fs : σ > 0} forms a semigroup with respect to convolution, i.e.

0

Fs (cid:63) Fs(cid:48) = Fs+s(cid:48) whenever σ, σ(cid:48) > 0.

Remark 3. We emphasize that the theorem does not resolve the case σ < 0, for which formula (11) would be
manifestly false. Indeed, it may be seen via an estimate similar to (10), see Theorem 12.23, [1], and the Hurwitz
formula (13) that Fs ∈ L1[0, 1] even for negative σ (assuming, as usual, that |t| > 1). However, the Fourier
coeﬃcients of an integrable function converge to zero as |k| → ∞ (by the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma), contrary to
what formula (11) would imply in this case.

3 A broadband representation of the pure tone

We will apply some classical results concerning the distribution of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.
Let {x} denote the fractional part of x. Recall that a sequence (xn)∞
n=1 is said to be uniformly distributed modulo
one if
#{1 ≤ n ≤ N : {xn} ∈ [α, β)} = β − α

for all [α, β) ⊂ [0, 1).

N→∞

3This formula is a direct consequence of Theorem 12.6 in [1]. It is given explicitly in [2] and also in [8] albeit in the latter it is

printed with incorrect sign.

4Note that convergence of the Fourier series to the value of the function almost everywhere in (0, 1) follows also from Lp ( p > 1 )

integrability by virtue of the celebrated theorems of L. Carleson and R. A. Hunt.

Let sn = σn + itn be the sequence of zeros of Riemann’s zeta function in the upper half plane, arranged in the
order of growing imaginary parts5, so that tn ≤ tn+1. It has been known for quite some time now6, [5], [7], [13],
that for every real number α (cid:54)= 0 the sequence (α tn)∞
n=1 is uniformly distributed modulo one. Closely related to
this fact is the Landau theorem, [9], which states the following: For a real number x > 1 we have

(cid:88)

0<tn≤T

x−sn = − T

as T → ∞

where Λ is the von ’Mangoldt function, i.e. Λ(x) = log p when x = pm for a prime p and m ∈ N, and Λ(x) = 0
otherwise. Recall also that the number of zeros of ζ with tn ∈ [0, T ] is known to be, see e.g. [4],

However, this result gives no information about the dependence of the rate of convergence on x. Indeed, the error
term in Landau’s asymptotic formula depends on x. Fortunately, more recently the formula was reﬁned by other
authors who analyze how the error depends on x. Speciﬁcally, we will apply a theorem of Fujii, [6], which is obtained
with the assumption that the R.H. holds, i.e. σn = 1/2 for all n. For its exact (rather lengthy) formulation the
reader is referred to the source, i.e. Theorem 2 in [6]. Here, we summarize as follows:

where the convergence type is as follows:

2. in L2-norm whenever σ > 1,

3. uniform whenever σ > 3/2.

Fσ+itn = exp (2πi . ),

(16)

Proof. We note that Theorem 1 applies to each Fsn as indeed tn ≥ t1 (cid:39) 14.1347 > 1. Thus, Fσ+itn ∈ L1. Moreover,

To prove pt. 1. we recall that whenever f ∈ L1[0, 1] and g is of bounded variation in [0, 1], the Parseval formula
holds, see [3], Chapter 10, i.e.

5Here, the zeros are listed with multiplicities. It is not known at present if all the nontrivial zeros of zeta are simple; see [10] for a

discussion of this problem.

commentary see [16].

Similarly, pt 3. follows from an observation that if σ > 3/2, then

This completes the proof. (cid:3)

Remarks on the proposed hypothesis. As mentioned in Section 1 it may be hoped that convergence in (16)
is in reality stronger than Theorem 2 indicates. Indeed, one may interpret Fig. 1 as supporting the claim that
sequence (Fsn ) is Ces`aro convergent to the fundamental tone pointwise almost everywhere. Note that convergence
everywhere in (0, 1) cannot hold, e.g. there is no convergence at a = 1/2 because Fsn(1/2) = 0 (since the zeros of
the alternating zeta function coincide with the zeros of ζ in the critical strip)7. Also, convergence in the L∞-norm
seems unlikely. Another subtle question is whether or not the optimal convergence result is inextricably dependent
on the R.H.

4.1 Broadband encryptions of periodic functions
Suppose f is a suﬃciently regular function on (0, 2π] ≡ T.

(cid:80)
In fact, in order to focus attention we assume
m∈Z | ˆf (m)| < ∞, so that the Fourier series of f converges uniformly and therefore f is continuous on T. In
order to simplify notation we also assume ˆf (0) = 0. In light of Theorem 2 it is natural to consider the following
encryption of f (depending on ﬁxed σ and n):

∞(cid:88)

∞(cid:88)

Mσ,n[f ](a) =

ˆf (m)Fσ+itn (ma) +

m=1

m=1

ˆf (−m)Fσ+itn (ma).

Theorem 1 shows that the frequency modes of Fσ+itn decay in magnitude as k−σ, i.e. very slowly for σ ∈ (0, 1].
Hence, Mσ,n[f ] is typically going to have a lot of high-frequency content, constituting a broadband encryption of
the function f . Nevertheless, in light of Theorem 2, one can expect that much information about f can be retained
in a family of broadband models, and recovered when desirable via simple averaging. Indeed, one may expect

Mσ,n[f ] ≈ f.

7It has been brought to the author’s attention that convergence is also known to fail at the rational points a = k/l where l is a

square-free integer.

Now, let ΦT,m be deﬁned by ΦT,m(a) = ΦT (ma) for m ∈ N, and also ΦT,−m = ΦT,m. We have

Mσ,n[f ] − f =

ˆf (m)(ΦT,m(a) − e2πima).

In essence the argument in (18) relies upon the fact that, for a smooth g, ˆΦT (k) ˆg(k) = O(log k/(k1+ε log T ))
whenever k > 1. Now, observe that ˆΦT,m(mk) = ˆΦT (k) while the Fourier coeﬃcients corresponding to indices not
divisible by m all vanish. This implies ˆΦT,m(k) ˆg(k) = O(log k/(|m|1+εk1+ε log T )) for k > 1. Hence

i.e. the double series on the right converges absolutely for suﬃciently large T and its limit is zero as T approaches
inﬁnity. This endows (19) with one rigorous interpretation. Again, it is an open problem to describe the optimal
type of convergence that takes place in this scenario. However, as in Theorem 2, it is clear that convergence becomes
increasingly stronger as σ increases. It is interesting to observe the inherent counterbalance of this phenomenon
with the diminishing high frequency content in the encryptions as σ increases.

In addition, it is interesting to observe that any attempt at recovery of signal f from Mσ,n[f ] (i.e. decryption)
would be a complicated matter when the waveform Fσ+itn is not known a priori. However, when it is known and in
addition its Fourier coeﬃcients diminish relatively rapidly, then decryption is a simple matter, see [14]. Finally, we
point out that when analogous operations are considered for digital signals the encryption as well as the decryption
can be computed with high numerical eﬃciency, [15], although the problem of numerical stability of these processes
would warrant a separate discussion in the case of slowly diminishing Fourier coeﬃcients (small σ).

4.2 Details of the numerical experiment

The graphs displayed in Fig. 1 have been obtained by means of numerical evaluation of Fs(a) for σ > 0. It is based
on the Hurwitz formula (13) as well as the following classical estimate for ζ(s, a), see Theorem 12.21, [1]:

N(cid:88)

n=0

ζ(s, a) =

1

(n + a)s +

(N + a)1−s

s − 1

+ o(N ).

Thus, the approximate values of ζ(s, a) are obtained from the ﬁrst two terms on the right. The rate of convergence
of the o(N ) term depends on the size of |s|. Generally, one has to engage more steps (larger N ) when |s| is large,
especially so for s in the critical strip, i.e. where the objects at hand are the most interesting. Also, for relatively
large |s| the computation of Γ(1 − s), an ingredient in (13), becomes more problematic. For moderate magnitudes
of s qualitatively tenable examples can still be computed via asymptotic formulas.
For the numerical values of the sequence (tn) we have relied on data from [12]. It is worthwhile pointing out
that when s = sn the size of factor eiπs in (13) is very small (∼ 5.1 × 10−20 already for s1). This implies that the
diﬀerence between Fsn (a) and the function

a (cid:55)→ i(2π)s−1e−πis/2Γ(1 − s)ζ(1 − s, a),

s = sn

is so minuscule as to be negligible in most numerical applications, e.g. even for a fairly ﬁne discretization of variable
a ∈ (0, 1) the graphs a (cid:55)→ Fsn (a) appear smooth at the right end-point (in spite of having a singularity there of
type ie−πtn (1 − a)−.5−itn).

n≤237 Fsn/237 in comparison with the cosine and the sine functions.
Note that the oscillatory patterns intensify toward the left end of the interval. This is related to the fact that
Fsn break into chirpy oscillations at this end. Note also that the function assumes value zero in the middle of
the interval. This is rigorously true because s (cid:55)→ Fs(1/2) coincides with the alternating zeta function and hence
Fsn (1/2) = 0 for all n.
