Abstract

The capacity region of the Multicast Cognitive Interference Channel (CIFC) is investigated. This
channel consists of two independent transmitters that wish to multicast two different messages, each
of them to a different set of users. In addition, one of the transmitters –commonly referred to as
the cognitive transmitter– has prior non-causal knowledge of both messages to be transmitted. This
scenario combines difﬁculties and challenges arising in the Interference Channel, the Broadcast Channel
and multicasting communications. Our aim concerns the derivation of optimal interference mitigation
techniques in such a challenging communication setup. We investigate to this end the multi-primary
CIFC and its dual multi-secondary CIFC under various interference regimes as an attempt to build a
thorough understanding for the more general setting. It is shown that, for some regimes, well-known
coding techniques for the conventional CIFC remain still optimal in the presence of multicasting. While
in other regimes, evolved encoding and/or decoding strategies are crucial. A careful use of these coding
schemes and new outer bounding techniques allows us to characterize the capacity region for several
classes of discrete memoryless and Gaussian channels in different interference regimes.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Cognitive Interference Channel (CIFC) was ﬁrst introduced by Devroye et al. [1] as
an interference channel with two sources and two destinations in which one of the sources
has full non causal knowledge of both messages to be transmitted, as depicted in Fig. 1. The
cognitive source models the secondary transmitter of a cognitive radio environment, which,
upon sensing the primary transmitter’s message, communicates the secondary message to the
secondary user. As such, the secondary source should not create too much interference in the
secondary transmission so as not to cause impediment to the primary communication, however,
it can also cooperate with the primary source and thus enhance the performances of the primary
communication. As it is deﬁned, a CIFC can be regarded as a Broadcast Channel with a helper,
i.e., the primary encoder. The helper enhances the transmission of the message W1 in the BC
formed by X2 and the two destinations (Y, Z), however, it creates more interference at user Z
that is interested only in message W2. The optimal transmission strategy needs to capture such
a tradeoff, and is thus hitherto unknown, however, a few cases denoted as interference regimes
are to this day fully understood.

The ﬁrst capacity result of this setting is due to Maric et. al [2] for the “very strong inter-
ference” regime based on an equivalence with the Interference Channel (IFC) with a common
message. Later Wu et. al in [3], and independently Jovicic et. al in [4], characterized the capacity
region of the “very weak interference” regime. The capacity of the Z-CIFC with a noiseless link
was derived by Liu et al. in [5] and the classes of Less-Noisy and More-Capable CIFC were
investigated in the works of Vaezi [6], [7]. Lately, Rini et. al proposed in [8] a unifying inner
bound that is capacity achieving in all regimes in which capacity is known, through a combination

of known techniques of binning, rate splitting, and superposition coding. They also suggest a new
outer bound that alleviates the computational complexity of existing outer bounds which involve
auxiliary random variables. Additionally, based on the proposed inner bound, the capacity region
of a new regime, denoted as “ better cognitive decoding” regime, was derived along with the
capacity of the semi-deterministic CIFC.

As for the Gaussian CIFC, the capacity region remains to be fully characterized, yet, some
regimes are fully understood: the weak interference capacity region was derived in [3], capacity
of the very strong interference was reported in [2] and that of the primary decodes interference
regime was found in [9]. The S-CIFC, where interference is experienced only at the primary user’s
side, was also extensively studied and capacity for the weak interference case was characterized
under different regimes by Jiang et al. in [10], Vaezi et al. in [11], and Rini et al. in [9].
Extensions to multiple users were attempted in the rather exhaustive survey of [12] where many
messages are to be delivered to many receivers from many transmitters, a subset of which have
non-causal knowledge of some messages.

In this paper, we investigate another challenging multi-user scenario where multicasting trans-
mission over a CIFC are combined, as depicted in Fig. 2. The resulting Multicast CIFC is
composed of many primary users interested in a same message W1 and many secondary receivers
similarly interested in a same message W2. A possible deployment scenario of this setting consists

of several users (spectators) in a football stadium wishing to have access to instantaneous replay
of the most important actions on their cell phones while being served by two base stations: a
primary one destined to the hosting team, and a secondary one intended to serve the guest team.
The aim of this work is to infer optimal interference mitigation techniques, considering
this multicast setting, through the understanding of how coding schemes should account for
multicasting among both primary and secondary receivers. This task is rendered challenging by
both the fact that the capacity region for the general CIFC is not known and that multicasting
imposes design efﬁcient interference mitigation techniques that could accommodate interference
for many users at once. Indeed, even in basic setups of multicast (or compound) Broadcast
Channels, i.e. without the helper, optimal schemes remains still unknown. In particular, we
investigate two dual classes of Multicast CIFC: the Multi-Primary CIFC where we consider only
one secondary receiver and design the optimal schemes to serve a set of N primary receivers,
and its dual Multi-Secondary CIFC. The two classes of Multicast CIFC bring distinct challenges
to face both at the encoding and at the decoding sides. It is shown that under speciﬁc interference
regimes, some known optimal schemes without multicasting remain optimal even in the presence
of multiple users. Whereas for other interference regimes, the introduction of more evolved
encoding and decoding strategies is necessary to derive capacity results. These strategies consist
in the two ideas of “Interference Decoding” and “Multiple Description coding” [13] whose
introduction will turn out to yield either optimality result, for the Multi-Primary CIFC, or a
signiﬁcant improvement over standard encoding techniques in the Multi-Secondary CIFC.

Contributions and outline:

We start by deriving in Section II an inner bound to the capacity region of the general Mutlicast
CIFC which combines optimal coding techniques of the Broadcast Channel (superposition coding
and random binning) with rate-splitting for the Interference Channel, and which generalizes
Marton’s inner bound to the Multicast setting. Then, in the remainder of the work, we evaluate
this rate region in both classes of Multi-Primary and Multi-Secondary CIFC in very strong
interference and very weak interference and a new regime denoted as mixed very weak/string
interference, as well as the Gaussian counterparts of these regimes. In Section III, we investigate
the Multi-Primary CIFC and derive the following results:

• The capacity region of the very strong interference regime,

March 7, 2016

6

• The capacity region of the very weak interference regime through a novel outer bound that

appears to be necessary to palliate the use of Csisz´ar & K¨orner sum-identity,

• The capacity region of the mixed very weak/strong interference regime while resorting to

the idea of Interference Decoding,

• The capacity region of the corresponding Gaussian Multi-Primary CIFC in very strong

interference, weak interference, and mixed weak/very strong interference regimes.

In Section IV, we investigate the Multi-Secondary CIFC and characterize, similarly to the

Mutli-Primary CIFC, and derive the following results:

• The capacity region of the very strong interference regime,
• The capacity region of the very weak interference regime through a novel outer bound that

palliates the use of Csisz´ar & K¨orner sum-identity,

• The capacity region of the mixed very weak/strong interference regime,
• The capacity region of the corresponding Gaussian Multi-Secondary CIFC in very strong

interference regime.

It is worth mention that the Gaussian Multi-Secondary CIFC in the weak interference regime
appears to be particularly challenging, as shown in the light of the work by Khisti et al. [14].
We address this difﬁculty that arises from multicasting constraint by sending multiple views
–intended to different users– of the same information which resorts to Multiple Description
coding. Although in this case the outer and inner bound we derived are not tight, our inner
bound strictly outperforms the inner bound where only a common description is used.

In Section V, we elaborate on a peculiar fact in the standard (non-multicast) CIFC which is
that the very strong interference and the better cognitive decoding are both included in the very
weak interference regime as proved by Vaezi in [15]. We show that this claim does not hold in
the considered scenario when we are in the presence of a strict multicast, i.e. N > 1 or M > 1.

An (M1n, M2n, n)-code for this channel consists of: two sets of messages, M1 ≡ {1, . . . , M1n}
and M2 ≡ {1, . . . , M2n}, two encoding functions, and (N + M )-decoding functions. The
encoding function at source 1 (the primary source) assigns an n-sequence xn
1 (W1) to each message
W1 while the encoding function at source 2 assigns an n-sequence xn
2 (W1, W2) to each pair of
messages (W1, W2) ∈ M1 × M2. The secondary decoders indexed by k ∈ [1 : M ] assign to
k an estimate message ˆW2,k while the primary decoders indexed by

Remarks In the absence of the helper, i.e., when X1 = Q1 = ∅, the inner bound collapses
to Marton’s inner bound in the multicast setting with the common auxiliary rv Q and the two
private ones U and V . On the other hand, the variables X1 and Q1 account for rate-splitting at
the primary source. The rate splitting at the secondary source is already contained in Marton’s
coding [16] with the common auxiliary Q. Thus, this inner bound combines both optimal coding
schemes for the Broadcast Channel [16] and Interference Channel [17].

Proof: The proof is relegated to Appendix B.

In the sequel, we investigate two distinct classes of Multicast-CIFC. The Multi-Primary CIFC
where we assume the existence of only one secondary receiver M = 1, which will allow us
to investigate the optimal interference mitigation techniques for primary receivers. Then, we
investigate as well the dual class referred to as Multi-Secondary CIFC where we consider only
one primary receiver N = 1 and characterize the optimal interference mitigation technique within
the set of secondary users.

III. CAPACITY RESULTS FOR THE MULTI-PRIMARY CIFC

We refer to this class of Multicast CIFC as the Multi-Primary CIFC since it consists of only
one secondary receiver, Z as denoted in the sequel, and N primary receivers as shown in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. The Multi-Primary Cognitive Interference Channel.

Our aim in this section is to characterize the capacity region of this class of channels under
distinct interference regimes resorting to the inner bound stated in Theorem1 and, in a speciﬁc
regime, a more evolved decoding scheme –referred to as Interference Decoding– when (5) would
be limited by the decoding behavior of the users.

A. Capacity region of the Multi-Primary CIFC in the Very Strong Interference regime

In this part of the work, we derive the capacity region of the Multi-Primary CIFC setting in
the very strong interference regime. To this end, consider the multicast CIFC described in Fig 3.

Assumption 1 (Strong interference). The strong interference condition is deﬁned as:

∀PX1X2 ,

I(X2; Z|X1) ≤ min
j∈[1:N ]

I(X2; Yj|X1) .

∀PX1X2 ,

I(X1X2; Yj) ≤ I(X1X2; Z) .

min
j∈[1:N ]

(17)

Theorem 2 (Very strong interference). The capacity region of the Multi-Primary CIFC satisfying
assumptions (16) and (17) is given by the set of rate pairs (R1, R2) that verify:

R2 ≤ I(X2; Z|X1) ,

R1 + R2 ≤ min
j∈[1:N ]

I(X1X2; Yj) ,

(18)

(19)

for some PD PX1X2.

Proof: The proof of achievability follows from rate region (5) letting Q1 = X1 and Q =

U = V = X2. This implies that all users Yj and Z decode both signals (X1, X2).

The obtained rate region is of the form:

I(X1X2; Yj) ,

∗R1 ≤ min
j∈[1:N ]
R2 ≤ I(X2; Z|X1) ,
R2 ≤ min
j∈[1:N ]

I(X2; Yj|X1) ,

R1 + R2 ≤ I(X1X2; Z) ,
R1 + R2 ≤ min
j∈[1:N ]

I(X1X2; Yj) .

(20a)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

One can notice that (20) is redundant due to the sum-rate (24) while (22) is redundant due
the strong interference assumption (16), and expression (23) is redundant by the very strong
interference condition (17). As for the converse, it follows from the strong interference condition
(16) alone and is given in Appendix C.

B. Capacity region of the Multi-Primary CIFC in the Very Weak Interference regime

We now give the capacity region of the under the very weak interference regime. To this end,

se state the next assumption.
Assumption 3 (Weak interference). Let Pw be the set of all joint PDs PU X1X2 which satisfy the
following Markov chain:

U −(cid:10)− (X1, X2) −(cid:10)− (Y1,··· , YN , Z1,··· , ZM ) .

March 7, 2016

(25)

DRAFT

The weak interference regime is deﬁned as:

∀j ∈ [1 : N ] ,

∀PU X1X2 ∈ Pw ,

I(U ; Yj|X1) ≤ I(U ; Z|X1) .

11

(26)

Assumption 4 (Very weak interference). The very weak interference regime is to verify (26)
while to further satisfy:

∀j ∈ [1 : N ] ,

∀PU X1X2 ∈ Pw ,

I(U X1; Yj) ≤ I(U X1; Z) .

(27)

The intuitive extension of the result of the standard CIFC (non-multicast CIFC with N = 1)
to an arbitrary number of users N will prove to be optimal for this regime as well. Yet, the
proof of the resulting capacity region presents a major difﬁculty in the converse part. Indeed, the
multicast nature of the transmission prevents from resorting to Csisz´ar & K¨orner’s identity that
was originally used in [4], [3]. To this end, an alternative proof of converse is required herein.

Theorem 3 (Very weak interference). The capacity region of the Multi-primary CIFC in very
weak interference regime is given by the set of rate pairs satisfying:

R1 ≤ min
j∈[1:N ]
R2 ≤ I(X2; Z|X1U ) ,

I(X1U ; Yj) ,

for some arbitrarily PD PU X1X2 satisfying U −(cid:10)− (X1, X2) −(cid:10)− (Y1,··· , YN , Z).

(28)

(29)

Proof: The achievability follows from the inner bound in (5) by letting Q = U, Q1 =
(X1, U ), and V = X2 which amounts to enabling decoders Yj to decode only their useful signal
while user Z decodes both signals (X1, X2). We end up with the inner bound:

R1 ≤ min
j∈[1:N ]
R2 ≤ I(X2; Z|X1U ) ,

I(X1U ; Yj) ,

R1 + R2 ≤ I(X1X2; Z) .

(30)

(31)

(32)

Using the very weak interference condition (27), the sum-rate bound is redundant. Hence, the
achievability is proved. As for the converse, the proof is more evolved and is presented in
Appendix D. The proof is valid under the loose condition of weak interference assumption
alone (26) and originates from noticing that this condition implies a “conditional less-noisiness”
[18] order between Yj and Z conditioned on X1.

12

In both previously investigated regimes of very weak and very strong interference, the inner
bound (5) proves to be optimal and an extension of the intuitive coding schemes to an arbitrary
number of users turns out to be optimal, though it might have required to write a new outer
bound to prove the optimality. In the sequel, we investigate a setting that did not arise in the
non-multicast CIFC where N = 1 and that will turn out to require a more evolved coding scheme
that can be encompassed with the inner bound (5).

C. Capacity region of the Multi-Primary CIFC in the Mixed Very Weak/Strong Interference
regime

We consider a Multi-Primary CIFC where we can partition the multicast set of users Yj ,
j ∈ [1 : N ], into two subsets. A subset W where all users are in weak interference, and a
subset S where users are in the strong interference regime, however, very weak or very strong
interference can be veriﬁed in either of the sets, without being imposed on both sets.

Assumption 5 (Mixed very weak/strong interference). The mixed very weak/strong interference
regime is deﬁned by the following conditions:

∀j ∈ W ,
∀j ∈ S ,

I(U ; Yj|X1) ≤ I(U ; Z|X1) ,
I(X2; Z|X1) ≤ I(X2; Yj|X1) ,

j∈S I(X1X2; Yj) ≤ I(X1X2; Z) or min

j∈W I(U X1; Yj) ≤ I(U X1; Z) ,

min

for all PU X1X2 that satisﬁed the Markov chain:

U −(cid:10)− (X1, X2) −(cid:10)− (Y1,··· , YN , Z1,··· , ZM ) .

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

Before enunciating the main result of this section, the following remark is crucial. The set
that experience very strong interference would require decoding the interfering
of users Yj
codeword X2, whilst those that experience very weak interference are required to decode only
their intended useful codewords U and X1. User Z is required to decode all codewords in
both interference regimes. As it is enunciated, the inner bound (5) fails in encompassing this
differentiated behaviour of users Yj since it relies on a similar decoding strategy for all users
Yj. Thus, the need for a more evolved decoding strategy arises, which justiﬁes the introduction
of the idea of “Interference Decoding”.

March 7, 2016

DRAFT

13

This decoding strategy was ﬁrst investigated by the authors for a Compound Broadcast Channel
[13] which can be regarded as a multicast setting where the many users of the multicast
are designated by the many possible channel instances of the Broadcast setting. Interference
Decoding allows each user in the multicast group Yj to decode/ or not the interfering codeword
X2, and thus, provides for a differentiated decoding at all users. Resorting to this idea allows to
state the following result.

Theorem 4 (Mixed very weak/strong interference). The capacity region of the Multi-primary
CIFC satisfying conditions (33)–(35), is given by the set of rate pairs satisfying:

R1 ≤ min
j∈W I(U X1; Yj) ,
R2 ≤ I(X2; Z|U X1) ,

for some joint input PD PU X1X2 such that U −(cid:10)− (X1, X2) −(cid:10)− (Y1,··· , YN , Z).

R1 + R2 ≤ min

j∈S I(X1X2; Yj) ,

(37)

(38)

(39)

Proof: The converse proof follows in the exact same manner as the converse proof of
both weak and strong interference cases. As for the achievability part, it is more involved and
requires introducing the idea of Interference Decoding. The decoders Yj with j ∈ W will choose
to decode only the useful signal U and X1 while the users that are in strong interference, i.e Yj
with j ∈ S, will decode all signals transmitted by source 2 and source 1, that is: (U, X1, X2).
User Z is allowed to decode all codewords as well. Proof details can be found in Appendix E.

D. Capacity results for the Gaussian Multi-Primary CIFC

Consider the following Gaussian Multicast CIFC model as shown in Fig 4:

∀j ∈ [1 : N ] ,

Yj = bjX2 + X1 + nj ,

(40)

(41)
where bj, j ∈ [1 : N ], and a are real numbers, and where (n1,··· , nN ), and nz are additive
white Gaussian noise components with powers N1 = ··· = NN = Nz = 1.

Z = X2 + aX1 + nz ,

In this section, we derive the capacity region for several different regimes of the Gaussian

Multi-Primary CIFC.

Proof: A detailed proof of this theorem is given in Appendix F. However, hereafter the

outline of proof for every interference regime.

1) Very strong interference regime. The achievability scheme consists in letting the two Gaus-
√
sian codewords (X1, X2) to be arbitrarily correlated, deﬁning thus: E[X1X2] = ρ
P1P2.
The proof of converse can be deduced from Rini et al.’s work [9] by showing that their
suggested outer bound can be generalized to an arbitrary number of primary users.

2) Weak interference regime. Note here ﬁrst that we no longer consider very weak interference
but we rather investigate the looser condition of weak interference. The reason being that,
in the Gaussian case, we can resort to Dirty-Paper Coding to eliminate the interference
(U, X1) at decoder Z, alleviating thus the decoding constraint at user Z, i.e.,

I(U X1; Yj) ≤ I(U X1; Z) .

(55)

The achievability part is brieﬂy described as follows: Split the power P2 into two parts ηP2
and (1 − η)P2. Generate a Gaussian ARV U with variance (1 − η)P2 and let it arbitrarily
correlated to X1 through the correlation coefﬁcient ρ. Generate a Gaussian ARV V that
dirty paper codes jointly the interference component Xu + aX1. The converse part follows
from Entropy Power Inequality along with some analytic manipulations.

3) Mixed weak/very strong interference regime. The achievability relies on the idea of Inter-
ference Decoding along with a strategic combination of both coding schemes for weak and
very strong interference regimes. As for the converse, it follows similarly from combining
entropy power inequality and entropy maximization techniques.

16

In the sequel we give a simpliﬁed expression of the capacity regions enunciated above for
some setting where the interference components seen at the primary decoders are coherent, i.e.
all bj’s are of the same sign, as opposed to the non-coherent interference case where bj’s might
be of distinct signs.

Corollary 1. 1) Provided that all gains bj’s share the same sign, i.e., coherent weak interference,

In addition, the capacity region is the intersection of the single capacity regions.

Proof: The proof of this corollary is given in Appendix F.

To illustrate the results of this corollary, we plot the capacity region for two settings, in both

coherent and non-coherent interference regimes as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.

In this section, we have investigated the Multi-Primary CIFC which consists of one secondary
user Z and N primary users Yj, j ∈ [1 : N ]. The aim was to characterize the capacity
region in different interference regimes and infer on the optimal required interference mitigation
techniques. The need for a more evolved decoding technique arises in the mixed interference
case, as opposed to the very weak and very strong interference regimes where the intuitive
extension of the optimal non-multicast scheme turned out to be optimal for the multicast setting
as well. In the sequel, we investigate the Multi-Secondary CIFC and characterize in a similar
manner the optimal interference mitigation techniques in distinct interference regimes.

IV. CAPACITY RESULTS FOR THE MULTI-SECONDARY CIFC

exhibit some similarities, originate from fundamentally different challenges to solve as will be

A. Capacity region of the Multi-Secondary CIFC in the Very Strong Interference regime

Assumption 6 (Very strong interference). The very strong interference regime is deﬁned by:

(∀k ∈ [1 : M ]) , I(X2; Zk|X1) ≤ I(X2; Y |X1) ,
I(X1X2; Y ) ≤ I(X1X2; Zk) .

(60)

(61)

for all joint PDs PX1X2.

It is worth to mention the above assumption implies that all users Zk and Y are assumed to

experience strong interference, and thus can all of them decode the interference.

Theorem 6 (Very strong interference). The capacity region of the Multi-Secondary CIFC in very
strong interference is deﬁned by all rate pairs verifying:

R2 ≤ min
k∈[1:M ]

I(X2; Zk|X1) ,

R1 + R2 ≤ I(X1X2; Y ) ,

(62)

(63)

for some joint PD PX1X2.

Proof: The inner bound follows from superposing the codeword letting similarly to previ-
ously Q1 = X1, V1 = V2 = V and Q = U = V = X2, i.e., allowing all users to decode all
codewords. The proof of converse is standard and follows along similar lines to the proof of
Multi-Primary CIFC presented in Appendix C.

B. Capacity region of the Multi-Secondary CIFC in the Very Weak Interference Regime

Assumption 7 (Very weak interference). The very weak interference regime is deﬁned by

I(U ; Y |X1) ≤ min
k∈[1:M ]
I(U X1; Y ) ≤ min
k∈[1:M ]

for all PU X1X2 verifying U −(cid:10)− (X1, X2) −(cid:10)− (Y, Z1, . . . , ZM ).

both constraints (64) and (65). The converse proof is more challenging, is dual to the proof
made for the Multi-Primary CIFC and is presented in Appendix G.

C. Capacity region of the Multi-Secondary CIFC in the Mixed Very Weak/Strong Interference
Regime

Assumption 8 (Mixed very weak/strong interference). Assume the set of secondary users can be
partitioned in two subsets: S corresponding to the set of users experiencing very strong inter-
ference, and W indicating the set of users that experience very weak interference. Accordingly,
the mixed very weak/strong interference regime is deﬁned by the set of inequalities:

I(U ; Y |X1) ≤ min
I(U X1; Y ) ≤ min

k∈W I(U ; Zk|X1) ,
k∈W I(U X1; Zk) ,

(∀j ∈ S) , I(X2; Zk|X1) ≤ I(X2; Y |X1) ,

for all joint PDs P U X1X2 such that U −(cid:10)− (X1, X2) −(cid:10)− (Y, Z1, . . . , ZM ).

I(X1X2; Y ) ≤ min

k∈S I(X1X2; Zk) ,

(68)

(69)

(70)

(71)

Theorem 8 (Mixed very weak/strong interference). The capacity region of the Multi-Secondary
CIFC in mixed very weak/ strong interference regime is the set of rate pairs satisfying:

R2 ≤ min

k∈S I(X2; Zk|X1) ,

R1 + R2 ≤ I(X1X2; Y ) ,

(72)

(73)

for some joint PD PX1X2.

Proof: Converse proof is straightforward. Achievability follows from evaluating the rate
region M with the choice V1 = V2 = ∅, Q1 = X1, and Q = U = V = X2 which is the optimal
scheme for very strong interference. Then, we note that:

which leads to the capacity region formulation.

Unlike the Multi-primary CIFC, the inner bound (5) is optimal for all discrete memoryless
interference regimes for which capacity region was characterized. Yet, the Gaussian counterpart,
i.e., the Gaussian Multi-Secondary CIFC, appears to be more challenging, especially in the weak
interference regime. Hence, it will require the introduction of a more evolved encoding technique.

D. Capacity results for the Gaussian Multi-Secondary CIFC

Let us consider the following channel model as depicted in Fig. 8:

Y = X1 + bX2 + N ,

Z1 = X2 + a1X1 + N1 ,

Z2 = X2 + a2X1 + N2 ,
where (N, N1, N2) are independent and N, N1, N2 ∼ N (0, 1).

1) The Very Strong Interference regime:

(76)

(77)

Assumption 9 (Very strong interference). The very strong interference regime in the Gaussian
setting is deﬁned by the couple of constraints:

(80)

(81)

Proof: The inner bound follows from noting that, since conditioned on X1 all channels Zj
have equal statistics, the index j does not play a role in the capacity region. The proof follows
along similar lines as in [9] since it is equivalent to a non-mutlticast CIFC.

2) The Weak Interference regime:

Assumption 10 (Weak Interference regime). The weak interference regime is deﬁned by |b| ≤ 1
which is equivalent to satisfy expression (64).

Note here, that we again investigate for the Gaussian case, a weak interference regime as
opposed to the discrete memoryless case where we can only characterize the capacity region of
the very weak interference regime.

Indeed, in the non-multicast setting, Z1 = Z2 = Z, i.e., a1 = a2 = a, the optimal strategy is
to apply Dirty-Paper Coding by letting the codeword destined to user Z, i.e. V , precode against
interference (Xu, X1) which is the signal intended to user Y . It is only at this condition that
we can alleviate the conditions of very weak interference to that of weak interference (64) since
the sum-rate decoding constraint is no longer necessary. However, in the multicast setting, by
setting X2 = Xv + Xu, we have that:

(82)

the transmission to both users Zk experiences different interference components Xu + a1X1 and
Xu + a2X1, it thus becomes inefﬁcient to apply only a “common” DPC scheme.

We remark that a similar challenging setting, though less general, was investigated in [14] when
dealing with simultaneous transmissions to a single-user having uncertainty about two different

DRAFT

interferences, e.g. a1Sn and a2Sn, and where tight upper and lower bounds on the capacity
region of such a setting are derived, but under the assumption that the sequence Sn is i.i.d
and Gaussian distributed. Besides having to deal with similar uncertainty about the interfering
sequence, we cannot assume an i.i.d. distribution for the input X1, which renders the analysis
of the inner and the outer bounds even more challenging.

23

The authors resort here to previous work presented as “Multiple Description Coding” that
was investigated within the framework of the Compound Broadcast Channel [13] but that can
be equivalently stated in the Multicast setting as well. In this precoding scheme, we introduce
two private descriptions, each decoded by a distinct destination Zk, leading thus to the rate
region R deﬁned by:

(cid:8)I(V Vk; Zk) − I(V Vk; U X1)(cid:9) ,
(cid:2)I(V Vk; Zj) − I(V Vk; U X1)(cid:3)−I(V1; V2|V U X1) ,

R2 ≤ min
k∈[1:2]

2 R2 ≤ (cid:88)

k∈[1:2]

R1 ≤ I(U X1; Y ) .

Our aim is to show that, compared to the inner bound based on “Common Description” coding:

I(V ; Zk) − I(V ; U X1) ,

R2 ≤ min
k∈[1:2]
R1 ≤ I(U X1; Y ) ,

(85)

(86)

multiple description coding can strictly enhance the rates at users Zk. To this end, we construct
two DPC schemes based on the two different ideas: MD-DPC and CD-DPC, and compare their
respective performances. In the sequel, let:

in which we split the common description power Pv into Pv − x and x and where: Xv ∼
N (0, Pv − x) ⊥ Xp ∼ N (0, x).

Vk = Xp + γkXu + αkX1 ,

We further combine with these DPC codewords a time sharing argument where the two private

descriptions are activated in different time slots. This yields a zero correlation cost:

In the sequel, we wish to compare the relative behaviour of both inner bounds through
analysing the behaviour of MD-DPC as function of x (the case x = 0 corresponds to CD-
DPC inner bound). We wish also to evaluate their gap to the best outer bound that we can
characterize for such a setting.

5) An outer bound for the weak interference regime: We can write an outer bound for the

weak interference regime inspired from the non-multicast CIFC.

Corollary 5 (Outer bound for the Gaussian weak interference regime). The capacity region of
the Gaussian Multicast CIFC is included in the set of rate pairs satisfying:

Fig. 9. Comparison of the bounds with: P1 = 3P2, a1 = .75, a2 = −.5, b = .1.

6) Comparison of the inner and outer bounds: In the light of the results in [13], we can
show by a simple function study that, the rate achieved by multiple description coding can be
strictly increasing in x and thus x = 0 (CD-DPC) yields its minimum value. In Fig. 9, we plot
the different inner bounds where we further combine the CD-DPC to a time-sharing argument,
referred to as block expansion in [19]. It is clear then that the improved endowed by multiple
description coding is strict and that it is becomes more relevant when the mismatch between the
multicast channels |a1 − a2| and the primary user power P1 increase.

We investigated the Multi-Secondary CIFC for which we characterize the capacity region
in some interference regimes and show that, for the Gaussian weak interference case, a more
evolved encoding scheme than the one allowed by the inner bound (5), is required to enhance
the transmission rates.

V. COMMENTS AND DISCUSSION

In a recent paper by Vaezi [15], it is shown that the better cognitive decoding (BCD) introduced
in [8] is nothing but the mere very weak interference (VWI) regime and that the new capacity

astonishing result in the work of Vaezi lies in proving that the very strong interference (VSI)
regime is contained in the VWI regime for ﬁnite alphabets suggesting that apparently contradic-
tory regimes from a conceptual point of view, are in fact equivalent. Later on, we clarify how
the present work does not fall in such a triviality be it even for ﬁnite alphabet settings.

27

A crucial remark here is that the claim of Vaezi that the class of probability distribution
that verify (VSI) falls into the class of (VWI) or equivalently, the (BCD), does not hold in the
multicast setting. Let us ﬁrst review this claim of triviality by Vaezi. The three regimes are given
by the following conditions:

(VWI) , ∀PU X1X2 :
(BCD) , ∀PU X1X2 : I(U X1; Y ) ≤ I(U X1; Z) ,

I(X1; Y ) ≤ I(X1; Z) ,

 I(U ; Y |X1) ≤ I(U ; Z|X1) ,
 I(X1X2; Y ) ≤ I(X1X2; Z) ,

I(X2; Z|X1) ≤ I(X2; Y |X1) .

(VSI) , ∀PX1X2 :

(100)

(101)

(102)

The key tool to show the equivalence between VWI and BCD is to notice that:

∀PU X1X2 , I(U X1; Y ) ≤ I(U X1; Z) ⇒ ∀PU X1X2 , I(U ; Y |X1) ≤ I(U ; Z|X1) .

(103)

Thus, since:

⇒ ∀PU , I(U X1; Y ) ≤ I(U X1; Z) ,

which means that VSI implies BCD which in turn is equivalent to VWI.

However, e.g. in the multi-primary setting, the distinct regimes are deﬁned by:
I(U ; Yj|X1) ≤ I(U ; Z|X1) ,
I(U X1; Yj) ≤ I(U X1; Z) ,
I(X2; Z|X1) ≤ I(X2; Yj|X1) ,
I(X1X2; Yj) ≤ I(X1X2; Z) .

It is clear when there is only one primary channel output, i.e., N = 1, that what we recover is
the BCD and the VSI regime. However, when N > 1, there is no evidence why the VSI should

be included in the VWI since: V SI implies minj∈[1:N ] I(U X1; Yj) ≤ I(U X1; Z), but the other
constraint of VWI can not be implied since it is too strict:

VSI (cid:59) , ∀j ∈ [1 : N ]

I(U ; Yj|X1) ≤ I(U ; Z|X1) .

(108)

Thus, VSI cannot imply VWI for all classes of multicast CIFC.

A. Future line of work

The analysis we made in this paper, for the Multi-Primary CIFC and Multi-Secondary CIFC,
would serve as a baseline to further study the Multicast CIFC with arbitrary numbers of primary
and secondary users. We emphasize here, however, that this constitutes a challenging task, for
two main reasons: one that arises from the fact that the Multi-cast CIFC is even more general
than the Compound Broadcast channel, for which only Degrees of Freedom are well understood
to date, and the other one that stems from the fact that deﬁning more general interference regimes
becomes quickly intractable due to the multiple combinations of users.

Yet, introducing the ideas of Interference Decoding and Multiple Description coding will
clearly be of crucial importance when dealing with more general Multicast CIFC settings and
thus, a thoughtful combination of the two schemes seems to be needed for such settings.

APPENDIX A

BASIC PROPERTIES AND RESULTS

This appendix provides basic notions on some concepts used through this paper. Following
deﬁnition in [20], we use in this paper strongly typical sets and the so-called delta-convention.
Some useful facts are recalled here.
Deﬁnition 1. For any sequence xn ∈ X n and any symbol a ∈ X , notation N (a|xn) stands for
the number of occurrences of a in xn.
Deﬁnition 2. A sequence xn ∈ X n is called (strongly) δ-typical w.r.t. X (or simply typical if
the context is clear) if

and N (a|xn) = 0 for each a ∈ X such that PX(a) = 0. The set of all such sequences is denoted
by T n

PROOF OF ACHIEVABILITY FOR THE MULTICAST CIFC

All the channel outputs in the Multicast setting are to be treated in a similar manner, thus,

we show the achievability only with one primary channel output Y .

Rate splitting:
The message W1 is split in two parts W01 of rate R01 that is intended to be decoded by all

users and a private part W11 that is intended to be decoded only by user Y .

Codebook generation: At source 1: First generate 2nR01 sequences qn
i=1 PQ1(q1,i(w01)) . For each sequence qn
i=1 PX1|Q1(x1,i(w11, w01)).

spectively in 2nR11 bins Bn

1 (w11, w01, s02) and 2nR22 bins Bn

2 (w22, w01, s02).

Encoding: The encoder 1 sends xn

1 (w11, w01). The encoder 2 ﬁnds in bin Bn

0 (w01, w02) a

sequence indexed by s02 such that:

(xn

1 (w11, w01), qn

1 (w01), qn(w01, s02)) ∈ T (n)

[QQ1X1] .

(110)

Then, it looks in the product bin Bn
such that:

1 (w22, w01, s02)× Bn

2 (w22, w01, s02) for a couple of sequences

(xn

1 (w11, w01), qn

1 (w01), qn(w01, s02), un(s11, w01, s02), vn(s22, w01, s02)) ∈ T (n)

[QQ1U V X1] .

It then sends a codeword xn

2 (s11, s22, w01, s02).

The encoding will be ﬂawless if the following inequalities hold:

T02 − R02 ≥ I(X1; Q|Q1) ,
T11 − R11 ≥ I(U ; X1|Q1Q) ,
T22 − R22 ≥ I(V ; X1|Q1Q) ,

T11 − R11 + T22 − R22 ≥ I(U ; V |Q1Q) + I(U V ; X1|Q1Q) .

(111)

(112)

(113)

(114)

(115)

Decoding: Receiver 2 decodes simultaneously the indices (w01, s02, s22) while decoder 1
decodes simultaneously (w01, s02, w11, s11). The probability of error can be made arbitrarily small
if the following inequalities hold:

T22 ≤ I(V ; Z|QQ1) ,
T02 + T22 ≤ I(QV ; Z|Q1) ,
R01 + T02 + T22 ≤ I(Q1QV ; Z) ,

T11 ≤ I(X1U ; Y |Q) + I(QU ; X1|Q1) ,

T02 + T11 ≤ I(X1QU ; Y |Q1) + I(QU ; X1|Q1) ,

Fourrier Motzkin Elimination: After running FME on binning rates T02, T11, T22 and on rate

splitting parameters R01 and R02, we end up with the rate region in Theorem 1.

Multicast setting: All channel output Yj , j ∈ [1 : N ] perform all the same decoding strategy,
thus, the rate region can be written similarly obtained replacing Y with the minimum over all
channel outputs Yj, where j ∈ [1 : N ]. The same applied for all users Zk, k ∈ [1 : M ].

As for the achievability part, we consider the codebook construction in Appendix B, and let

Q1 = ∅ and Q = U. We can summarize the encoding constraints as follows:

T1 − R1 ≥ I(U ; X1) ,
T2 − R2 ≥ I(V ; X1|U ) .

(158)

(159)

As for the decoding constraints, user Z decodes the signal U and X1 non-uniquely, ﬁnding

the unique s2 such that for some w1 and s1:

δ (U X1V Z) ,

where un(s1) is in the bin deﬁned by s1. Thus, we end up with the constraints:

T2 ≤ I(V ; Z|X1U ) + I(V ; X1|U ) ,
T1 + T2 ≤ I(X1U V ; Z) + I(U V ; X1) .

On the other side, the users Yj can choose between two decoding strategies:
• Not decoding interference, i.e., ﬁnding the unique w1 for which:

(cid:0)un(s1), xn

(cid:1) ∈ T n

1 (w1), yn

δ (U X1Yj) ,

March 7, 2016

where un(s1) ∈ Bn

1 (w1) is in the bin deﬁned by w1. This yields the following constraint:

• Decoding interference non-uniquely, ﬁnding the unique w1 such that for some s2,

T1 ≤ I(U X1; Yj) + I(U ; X1) .

(cid:0)un(s1), xn

(cid:1) ∈ T n

1 (w1), vn(s1, s2), yn
j

δ (U X1V Yj) .

This results in the constraint:

T1 + T2 ≤ I(U X1V ; Yj) + I(V U ; X1) .

One then can write an achievable inner bound with all possible combinations of decoding choices
of each of the users Yj.

Using this idea, we let the group of users in strong interference decode interference as well,
and we let the users in weak interference decode only their intended signals U and X1. The
resulting set of constraints is given by:



T1 ≤ min
j∈W I(U X1; Yj) + I(U ; X1) ,
T2 ≤ I(V ; Z|X1U ) + I(V ; X1|U ) ,

(164)

(165)

(166)

(167)

(168)

(169)

Running FME on the resulting rate region yields:
R1 ≤ min
R2 ≤ I(V ; Z|X1U ) ,
R1 + R2 ≤ I(X1U V ; Z) ,
R1 + R2 ≤ min

j∈S I(U X1V ; Yj) .
Letting V = X2, we end up with the following achievable region:

j∈W I(U X1; Yj) ,

R1 ≤ min
j∈W I(U X1; Yj) ,
R2 ≤ I(X2; Z|X1U ) ,

R1 + R2 ≤ I(X1X2; Z) ,



with the strong interference or the weak interference condition, we can show that the sum-rate

The achieavability follows from the achievable rate region:

j∈[1:N ]

I(X1U ; Yj) ,

R2 ≤ I(V ; Z) − I(V ; X1U ) ,

(179)

obtained through the inner bound (5) by letting Q1 = Q = ∅ and considering only one of the
resulting corner points.

The optimal coding scheme is then to let:

X2 = Xu + Xv

, Xv ∼ N (0, ηP2)

, Xu ∼ N (0, (1 − η)P2) ,

U = Xu

, X1 ∼ N (0, P1) ,
(X1, Xu) ∼ N (0, ΣX1Xu) , ΣX1Xu =

V = Xv + γ(Xu + aX1) ,

(183)
where |ρ| ≤ 1 and γ is the optimal Dirty-Paper Coding parameter to precode against the
interference Xu + aX1 seen at user Z.

Thus, we obtain:

I(XuX1; Yj) = h(Yj) − h(Yj|XuX1)

(cid:32)

log2 (1 + ηP2) .

(184)

(185)

(186)

N.B: It is because we can apply DPC techniques for the Gaussian case that we are able to
relax the constraint of very weak interference to only weak interference. In the general case, it
is not possible for user Z to decode interference unless its resulting sum-rate is satisﬁed, i.e.,
R1 + R2 ≤ I(X1X2; Z).

The parameter ρ cannot be optimized for each instance of the primary channels Yj since the
bj’s are not all compulsorily equal (in sign and module), leading us to the max min expression.

Hereafter, the converse proof. Let us start by writing

nR2 = H(W2)

(188)

where (a) is a consequence of Fano’s inequality and (b) follows from the fact that W2 is

Since the three claims have similar proofs, we only show the ﬁrst one. The ﬁrst part of the
proof is trivial since the optimal ρ is obtained by +1 if all channel coefﬁcients bj are positive,
and −1 otherwise. The second half of the claim can be proved by letting Cj be the capacity
region of the CIFC (Z, Yj) in weak interference. Assume that all bj’s are positive. We have that:
