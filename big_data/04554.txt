We study symmetric and asymmetric optical multi-peak solitons on a continuous wave background
in the femtosecond regime of a single-mode ﬁber. Key characteristics of such multi-peak solitons,
as the formation mechanism, propagation stability, and shape-changing collisions, are revealed in
detail. Our results show that this multi-peak (symmetric or asymmetric) mode could be regarded as
a single pulse formed by a nonlinear superposition of a periodic wave and a single-peak (W-shaped
or antidark) soliton. In particular, a phase diagram for diﬀerent types of nonlinear excitations on a
continuous wave background including breather, rogue wave, W-shaped soliton, antidark soliton, pe-
riodic wave, and multi-peak soliton is established based on the explicit link between exact nonlinear
wave solution and modulation instability analysis. Numerical simulations are performed to conﬁrm
the propagation stability of the multi-peak solitons with symmetric and asymmetric structures.
Further, we unveil a remarkable shape-changing feature of asymmetric multi-peak solitons. It is in-
teresting that these shape-changing interactions occur not only in the intraspeciﬁc collision (soliton
mutual collision) but also in the interspeciﬁc interaction (soliton-breather interaction). Our results
demonstrate that each multi-peak soliton exhibits the coexistence of shape change and conservation
of the localized energy of light pulse against the continuous wave background.

INTRODUCTION

Nonlinear waves on a continuous wave background in
optical ﬁbers becomes a subject of intense research in
both theory and experiment these days [1–8]. Especially,
signiﬁcant progress has been made on the experimental
veriﬁcation of some unique nonlinear wave structures,
including the Peregrine rogue waves [9], Kuznetsov-Ma
breathers (KMBs) [10], Akhmediev breathers (ABs) [11],
as well as their shape-unchanging interactions such as the
AB collision [12], and superregular breather [8, 13] (i.e.,
quasi-AB collision with π/2 phase shift) in the picosecond
regime. These picosecond pulses are well described by the
standard nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (NLSE) which
accounts for the second-order dispersion and self-phase
modulation. Speciﬁcally, these unique waves appear as
a result of the modulation instability (MI) [5–8, 14], and
in turn the common features and diﬀerences among wave
manifestations enrich the MI understanding of the non-
linear stage. It should be emphasized that a crucial pre-
cise link between rogue waves and zero-frequency MI sub-
region is recently unveiled [15, 16], although a compre-
hensive investigation of exact relations between various
types of nonlinear waves on a background and MI still re-
mains largely unexplored. On the other hand, the utility
of these waves based on their special properties in gen-
erating high-quality pulse trains [17], high-power pulses
[18], breatherlike solitons [19], nonlinear Talbot eﬀects
[20], and the Peregrine comb [21] has been revealed.

In the present work we extend nonlinear waves on a
continuous wave background in the femtosecond regime,
since ultrashort pulses are tempting and desirable to
improve the capacity of high-bit-rate transmission sys-

tems. However in this case, higher-order eﬀects such
as the higher-order dispersion and self-steepening play
an important role and become non-negligible [22–24].
The resulting models of higher-order NLSE thus describe
nonlinear waves on a continuous wave background with
higher accuracy than the standard NLSE. Recent studies
demonstrated that nonlinear waves on a continuous wave
background in the femtosecond regime exhibit structural
diversity beyond the reach of the standard NLSE [25–39];
in particular, some interesting types of nonlinear waves
on a background which completely diﬀer from the known
breathers and rogue waves have been unveiled [31–39].
The underlying mechanism can be qualitatively but quite
explicitly interpreted by the corresponding MI features
[31, 34, 35]. Here, we report and discuss a family of
multiparametric symmetric and asymmetric multi-peak
solitons on a continuous wave background in the fem-
tosecond regime. One key characteristic of this soliton is
that it exhibits both localization and periodicity along
the transverse distribution on a background; the cor-
responding periodicity and localization for (symmetric
or asymmetric) solitons are well described by a periodic
wave and a single-peak (W-shaped or antidark) soliton,
respectively. Especially, we focus our attention on the im-
portant properties of this multi-peak solitons, including
the generation mechanism, propagation stability, and the
shape-changing interaction feature of asymmetric multi-
peak solitons, which have not been studied so far, to our
knowledge. For special parameter values (the continuous
wave background frequency vanishes), a part of our gen-
eral multi-peak soliton solution (i.e., the symmetric case)
reduces to results reported quite recently [37].

The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

In

Section II, the exact solution with a uniﬁed form de-
scribing symmetric and asymmetric multi-peak solitons
on a background of the higher-order NLSE is obtained.
The consistency between the symmetric and asymmet-
ric solitons is revealed by the optical intensity against
the background. Section III shows that the periodicity
and localization for (symmetric or asymmetric) solitons
are well described by a periodic wave and a single-peak
(W-shaped or antidark) soliton. In Section IV, the phase
diagram for diﬀerent types of nonlinear excitations is pre-
sented on the continuous wave frequency and perturbed
frequency plane. Numerical simulations were performed
timely to conﬁrm the propagation stability of the multi-
peak solitons in Section V. Section VI unveils the striking
shape-changing feature of asymmetric multi-peak soli-
tons which occur not only in the intraspeciﬁc collision
(soliton mutual collision) but also in the interspeciﬁc in-
teraction (soliton-breather interaction). The ﬁnal section
presents our conclusions.

II. THE MODEL AND MULTI-PEAK SOLITONS

ON CONTINUOUS WAVE BACKGROUND

Femtosecond pulses (i.e., the duration is shorter than
100 fs) propagation in optical ﬁbers with higher-order
physical eﬀects such as the third-order dispersion, self-
steepening, and delayed nonlinear response is governed
by the following higher-order NLSE [22, 23]

iuξ +

αuτ τ + γ|u|2u − iβuτ τ τ − is(|u|2u)τ

− iδu(|u|2)τ = 0,

(1)

where u is the envelope of the electric ﬁeld, ξ is the prop-
agation distance, τ is the retarded time, α and γ are
second-order dispersion and self-phase modulation, β is
the third-order dispersion, s is the self-steepening coeﬃ-
cient, and δ is the delayed nonlinear response. All quan-
tities have been normalized.

To study nonlinear waves in the femtosecond regime
exactly, we shall consider a special parametric condition
for the higher-order terms, i.e., s = 6β, s + δ = 0 with
α = γ. As a result, the model (1) reduces to the inte-
grable Hirota equation [40]. The latter has been studied
in a number of papers [27, 34, 37, 40–45], which involve
mainly the standard bright solitons [41–44], breathers
[45], and rogue waves [27].
In contrast to the afore-
mentioned results, we introduce, in the following, an in-
teresting family of multiparametric nonlinear wave solu-
tions describing symmetric and asymmetric multi-peak
solitons on a continuous wave background in the fem-
tosecond regime.

By means of the Darboux transformation method
[46, 47], multi-peak solitons on a continuous wave back-
ground with symmetric and asymmetric amplitude struc-
tures can be described by the analytical uniﬁed solution

with a general and concise form,

where the continuous wave background has the expres-
sion: u0 = aeiθ, θ = qτ + [αa2 − αq2/2 + β(6qa2 − q3)]ξ,
and u1, u2 stand for the symmetric and asymmetric
multi-peak solitons, respectively. It is evident that the
solution (2) is formed by a nonlinear superposition of
the hyperbolic function cosh ϕ and trigonometric func-
tion cos φ on the background u0. This unique nonlin-
ear superposition signal exhibits the characteristics of
the nonlinear structures on the nonvanishing background,
which is expressed as:

ϕ = 2ηi(τ + vξ),
v = β(2a2 + 4a2

The above expressions depend on the continuous wave
background amplitude a, frequency q, the real constant
a1 (without loss of generality we let a1 ≥ 0), the real pa-
rameter α describing the group-velocity dispersion and
the self-phase modulation, the real parameter β (a small
value) which is responsible for the higher-order terms.
Note that the existence condition q1 = −α/(4β)−q/2 [see
Eq. (3)] implies that this nonlinear mode is induced by
the higher-order eﬀects (β (cid:54)= 0) and, therefore, it has no
analogy in the picosecond regime governed by the stan-
dard NLSE. Additionally, the background frequency q
plays a key role in properties of nonlinear modes, since
it cannot be ignored by the Galilean transformation. In-
deed, the nonlinear modes exhibit proliﬁc structures de-
pending on the value of q [f.i., see Figs. 1 and 2].

The key novel property of this solution is that it fea-
tures both hyperbolic and trigonometric with the same
velocity v [see the hyperbolic function (cosh ϕ) and

Figure 2 depicts the typical optical amplitude proﬁles
of the periodic waves and solitons extracting from the lo-
calized modes u1, u2, respectively. As is shown, the pe-
riodic waves possess the same proﬁle feature (the same
W-shaped structure of periodic units and the same in-
tensity), but for a slight phase shift. Surprisingly, the
single-peak solitions display completely diﬀerent struc-
tures depending on the phases: one is a W-shaped soliton
with one peak and two symmetric valleys whose central
position is located at (ξ, τ ) = (0, 0), extracting from the
symmetric multi-peak soliton u1; the another is an an-
tidark soliton (a bright soliton on a nonvanishing back-
ground) with a slight phase shift, extracting from the

(cid:54)= 0 [thus q (cid:54)= q1,

trigonometric function (cos φ)]. This implies ηr (cid:54)= 0,
i.e., q (cid:54)= −α/(6β)]. As a re-
ηi
sult, the hyperbolic functions and trigonometric func-
tions describe the localization and the periodicity of
the transverse distribution τ of the localized waves, re-
spectively. The corresponding typical optical amplitude

(I =(cid:112)|u1,2(ξ, τ )|2) proﬁles are well displayed in Fig. 1.

Remarkably, the pulse features a localized soliton-like
multi-peak structure propagating in ξ direction. Or,
strictly speaking, this interesting solitary mode exhibits
both localization and periodicity along the transverse dis-
tribution τ . This indicates that the characteristics of
this wave come from a mixture of a soliton and a peri-
odic wave. Speciﬁcally, this pulse possesses a main peak
and several sub-peaks, and the latter are distributed on
both side of the main peak in a symmetric or asym-
metric way. Although the maximum optical intensity
is diﬀerent, the interesting connection is that, the op-
tical intensity against the background of the two soli-
tons with symmetric and asymmetric proﬁles, turns out

to coincide with each other, i.e., (cid:82) +∞
(cid:82) +∞

(cid:0)|u1|2 − a2(cid:1) dτ =
(cid:0)|u2|2 − a2(cid:1) dτ . It should be noted that the solution

(2) includes, as a special case, the symmetric solution u1
with q = 0 that was reported in [37].

III. FORMATION MECHANISM FOR

MULTI-PEAK SOLITONS

Next, to further understand the formation mechanism
of the localized multi-peak structure on a background,
our attention is then focused on extracting separately
the periodic wave (periodicity) and soliton (localization)
from the mixed state.

To this end, the nonlinear excitation signal possesses
a single modulated function (hyperbolic or trigonomet-
ric functions). In this interesting case, the background
frequency q plays a key role and should be chosen as
q = −α/(6β) (thus q (cid:54)= 0). Speciﬁcally, the periodic wave
exists on its own when ηi = 0 vanishes (thus a1 < a),

asymmetric multi-peak soliton u2. We note that the op-
tical intensity against the background of the two types of
solitons is consistent with each other. It is worth pointing
out that, the rational W-shaped soliton reported before,
is only the limiting case of us1 and up1 with a1 = a [34].
An analysis of above results, shown in Figs. 1 and
2, implies that, a formation mechanism of the localized
periodic modes may be interpreted as a nonlinear su-
perposition of a periodic wave and a single-peak soliton.
The W-shaped and antidark solitons with periodic mod-
ulation give rise to the symmetric and asymmetric multi-
peak modes, respectively.

NONLINEAR EXCITATIONS

FIG. 3: (color online) (a) Characteristics of modulation in-
stability growth rate on perturbed frequency and background
frequency (Q, q) plane with higher-order eﬀects, and (b) the
explicit correspondence of phase diagram for diﬀerent types
of nonlinear excitations on a continuous wave background. In
(a), notations “MI” and “MS” denote modulation instability
and modulation stability regions, respectively. In (b), “RW”
(Peregrine rogue wave), “KMB” (Kuznetsov-Ma breather),
and “AB” (Akhmediev breather) are casted in the MI re-
gion with corresponding exact perturbed frequencies Q = 0,
Q = 0, and |Q| < 2a (Q (cid:54)= 0), respectively. “WSS” (W-
shaped soliton), “ADS” (antidark soliton), and “PW” (peri-
odic wave) are mapped in the MS line q = qs; speciﬁcally,
W-shaped and antidark solitons exist at (q, Q) = (qs, 0) (the
blue dot), and periodic waves exist at q = qs with |Q| ≤ 2a
(Q (cid:54)= 0). The “MPS” (multi-peak soliton), whether symmet-
ric or asymmetric structure, is displayed in the same orange
“X-shaped” region, which is depicted via the explicit per-
turbed frequency expression 2ηr with diﬀerent values of a1,
from a1 = 0 to a1 (cid:29) a. Here the solid blue, black, red lines in
the orange region correspond to the cases with a1 = 0, a1 = a,
a1 (cid:29) a, respectively. The setup is β = 0.1, α = 1, a = 1.

The next step of interest and signiﬁcance is to under-
stand the multi-peak structures on a background via MI.
To this end, we ﬁrst turn our attention to the standard
linear stability analysis of the continuous wave u0 via
adding small amplitude perturbed Fourier modes p i.e.,
up = [a + p]eiθ, where p = f+ei(Qτ +ωξ) + f∗
−e−i(Qτ +ω∗ξ),
f+, f∗
− are small amplitudes, Q represents perturbed fre-

4

quency, and the parameter ω are assumed to be complex.
In this case, by comparing the perturbed modes p with
the unique exact nonlinear superposition signal in u1,2,
the nonlinear modes, Eq. (2), shall be regarded as the
nonlinear perturbation signal on background u0 with the
explicit perturbed frequency Q = 2ηr. Diﬀerent per-
turbed frequencies correspond to diﬀerent types of non-
linear excitations [48]. In this regard, we can establish
an explicit correspondence between various nonlinear ex-
citations and MI on the (Q, q) plane. The corresponding
characteristic outcomes are displayed in Fig. 3.

Figure 3(a) depicts the typical characteristics of MI
growth rate G = −Im{ω}, and Fig. 3(b) shows the ex-
plicit correspondence between MI and various nonlinear
excitations. Remarkably, there is a modulation stabil-
ity (MS) region [dashed line in Fig. 3(a)], i.e., G = 0,
in low perturbed frequency region (|Q| ≤ 2a), resulting
from the higher-order eﬀects, which is given analytically
q = qs = −α/(6β). Hence MI is always present in the
region |Q| ≤ 2a (Q (cid:54)= 0, q (cid:54)= qs). Instead, the MS re-
gions contain the whole higher perturbation frequency
region (|Q| > 2a) and a special MS region q = qs in a
low perturbation frequency region (|Q| ≤ 2a).

An interesting ﬁnding is that the MS condition q = qs,
is consistent with the existence condition for the peri-
odic wave and W-shaped/antidark soliton, Eqs. (4) and
(5). According to their perturbed frequencies, the W-
shaped/antidark solitons are located at (q, Q) = (qs, 0),
and periodic waves exist at q = qs line with |Q| < 2a,
Q (cid:54)= 0.

Next, we map the whole distribution region of multi-
peak solitons on the MI plane. To this end, the modu-
lated parameter a1 of the perturbed frequency 2ηr is con-
sidered as a continuous variable from a1 = 0 to a1 (cid:29) a.
The corresponding marginal condition, can be found an-
alytically: Q = ±{4a2 + 9Λ2/4}1/2 (when a(cid:48) = 0 with
Λ = q − qs), Q = ±3|Λ|/2 (when a1 (cid:29) a). Thus, the
existence range of the multi-peak solitons is identiﬁed in
the orange “X-shaped” region between the two marginal
lines [see Fig. 3(b)].

Remarkably, this unique “X-shaped” region involves
both a MS subregion with higher perturbation frequency
(|Q| > 2a) and a MI subregion with low perturbation
frequency (|Q| < 2a). Further, the solid black line in
the “X-shaped” region represents the intermediate con-
dition with a1 = a, which can be given analytically as:
Q = ±{[(9Λ2/8)2 + 9a2Λ2]1/2 + 9Λ2/8}1/2. It is inter-
esting to note that, if q = qs, the region a1 ≥ a [i.e., the
range from red line to black line] reduces to the point
(q, Q) = (qs, 0), where the multi-peak solitons are con-
verted into the W-shaped/antidark solitons; while an-
other region 0 ≤ a1 < a [i.e., the range from black line to
blue line] reduces to the q = qs line with |Q| ≤ 2a, Q (cid:54)= 0,
where the multi-peak solitons are translated into the pe-
riodic waves. We stress that this ﬁnding coincides with
the transition condition for nonlinear waves in Eqs.(4)
and (5).

V. STABILITY FOR MULTI-PEAK SOLITONS

As is well known, the stability plays an irreplaceable
role in nonlinear wave realization and application in ex-
periment. On the other hand, one should keep in mind
that the multi-peak solitons reported above are on a con-
tinuous wave background. The latter, in general, displays
the feature of MI, namely, a small perturbation may dis-
tort the wave proﬁles formed on top of it. In this regard,
we shall test the stability of multi-peak soliton propa-
gation on a continuous wave background with symmetric
and asymmetric structures. We perform direct numerical
simulations of Eq. (1) by the split-step Fourier method
with the initial condition u1,2(0, τ ), i.e., the exact solu-
tion (2) at ξ = 0. Figures 4 and 5 show the stability
of the symmetric and asymmetric multi-peak solitons by

comparison the analytical solution (2) u1,2 with the nu-
merical simulation of Eq. (1).

In Fig. 4, we ﬁrst show the propagation stability of
a typical symmetric multi-peak soliton u1. Interestingly,
the numerical result [Fig. 4 (b)] shows clearly that the
symmetric multi-peak soliton can propagate in a stable
manner against the MI and ineradicable numerical devi-
ations.
In particular, we compare the numerical result
with the analytical solution by the corresponding ampli-
tude proﬁles at diﬀerent ξ. It shows in Figs. 4 (c) and
(d) that the numerical result (dotted red line) is in good
agreement with the analytical solution (solid black line)
at ξ = 2, 8.

Next, we test the stability of the asymmetric multi-
peak soliton. Here, we keep the the same parameters
as in Fig. 4, but the initial state is chosen as u2(0, τ ).

Our results indicate no collapse arising from the MI and
numerical deviations.
Instead, stable propagation over
tens of propagation distances is observed (see Fig. 5).
Namely, the asymmetric feature of the transverse ampli-
tude distribution seems to have no eﬀect on the propa-
gation stability of the multi-peak solitons. It should be
pointed out that although here we have demonstrated
the results of the stability only for the multi-peak soli-
tons in Eq. (1), similar conclusions hold for other-type
nonlinear waves as well, provided propagation distances
are kept within reasonable values.

VI. SHAPE-CHANGING FEATURE OF
ASYMMETRIC MULTI-PEAK SOLITONS

Let us then, in this section, focus our attention on
characteristics of interaction between nonlinear waves re-
ported above. In fact, we ﬁnd that rich intraspeciﬁc and
interspeciﬁc interactions do exist in this system via ex-
tracting explicit existence conditions from Table I in the
Appendix. However, our interest is conﬁned to a novel
kind of shape-changing interaction, which was not be re-
ported before. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that the asymmetric
multi-peak soliton u2 exhibits shape-changing character-
istics before and after interactions.
Interestingly, this
shape-changing interaction involves mutual collisions of
multipeak solitons as well as interactions between multi-
peak solitons and other-type nonlinear waves. In particu-
lar, it is found that the shape-changing feature is speciﬁc
to the multi-peak solitons.
We ﬁrst study the mutual collision of two multipeak
solitons with the coexistence condition qj = (3qs − q)/2,
q (cid:54)= qs, j = 1, 2. As shown in Fig. 6, two incident multi-
peak solitons S1, S2 with diﬀerent features of peak dis-
tributions move from ξ → −∞ and approach each other;
they undergo collision around (ξ, τ ) = (0, 0) and form a
higher peak. They then separate with a small phase shift
and propagate to ξ → +∞. It is evident to observe that
the multi-peak features of outgoing multi-peak structures
S(cid:48)
1, S(cid:48)
2, including the peak numbers and peak intensity
distributions, are changed signiﬁcantly after the collision
[see intensity proﬁles in Fig. 6]. This indicates that the
collision is shape-changing. For the details, by compar-
ing intensity proﬁles S1, S2 with S(cid:48)
2, we ﬁnd that, for
each soliton, the maximum intensity decreases while the
sub peaks increase. We may infer that this fascinating
shape-changing collision could stem from the intensity
transfer from subpeaks to main peaks of the multi-peak
soliton itself, rather than the intensity transfer between
solitons.

1, S(cid:48)

To prove the validity of the conjecture above, we then
analyze the localized energy of light pulse against the
background of multipeak solitons with the expression

(cid:8)|u(ξ, τ )|2 − a2(cid:9) dτ . As a result, the localized

Ie = (cid:82) τ2

energy of multi-peak solitons before and after the shape-
changing collision can be investigated via optimal numer-
ical method at diﬀerent propagation distance ξ. The total

localized energy of these two solitons [Ie(s1) + Ie(s2)] is
conserved which can be veriﬁed directly when τ1 = −∞,
τ2 = +∞. The localized energy of the each multi-
peak soliton [Ie(s1), Ie(s2)] is obtained by the appro-
priate choice for τ1, τ2. For a selected initial propaga-
tion distance, i.e., ξ < 0, we calculate Ie(s1) and Ie(s2)

tively. Note that the transverse position τ0 is located
between S1, S2, leading to |u(ξ, τ0)| = a, and vice versa
for positive ξ. Then the interesting ﬁnding is that each
multi-peak soliton preserves its localized energy before
and after the collision. Namely, after multi-peak solitons
collide, the shape change and localized energy conserva-
tion of the each multi-peak soliton coexist. It is noted
that, this shape-changing feature is completely diﬀerent
from the known shape-changing collisions between stan-
dard solitons in the coupled NLS systems that describe
a process of energy transference between solitons in one
component [49].

VII. CONCLUSION

7

In summary, symmetric and asymmetric multi-peak
solitons on a continuous wave background in the fem-
tosecond regime have been investigated analytically and
numerically. Key properties of such multi-peak solitons,
as the formation mechanism, propagation stability, and
shape-changing collisions, have been revealed in detail,
for the ﬁrst time to our knowledge.

This intriguing multi-peak soliton exhibits both local-
ization and periodicity along the transverse distribution
on a background. The corresponding periodicity and lo-
calization for multi-peak (symmetric or asymmetric) soli-
tons are well described by a periodic wave and a single-
peak (W-shaped or antidark) soliton, respectively.

Although the maximum optical

intensity is diﬀer-
ent, the interesting connection is that, the optical in-
tensity against the background of the symmetric and
asymmetric solitons, turns out to coincide with each
other under the same initial parameter condition, i.e.,
−∞
Especially, a phase diagram for diﬀerent types of non-
linear excitations on a continuous wave background in-
cluding breather, rogue wave, W-shaped soliton, antidark
soliton, periodic wave, and multi-peak soliton is estab-
lished based on the explicit link between exact nonlinear
wave solution and MI analysis. Numerical simulations
were performed to conﬁrm the propagation stability of
the multi-peak solitons with symmetric and asymmetric
structures.
Finally,

the remarkable shape-changing feature of
asymmetric multi-peak solitons, occurring not only in the
intraspeciﬁc collision (soliton mutual collision) but also
in the interspeciﬁc interaction (soliton-breather interac-
tion), was unveiled. It is demonstrated that each multi-
peak soliton exhibits the coexistence of shape change and
conservation of the localized energy of light pulse against
the continuous wave background. The shape-changing in-
teraction between nonlinear waves on a continuous wave
background will enrich our understanding of localized
wave collision in the (1+1)-dimensional scalar nonlinear
wave evolution systems.

FIG. 8: (color online) (a) shape-unchanging interaction be-
tween a breather and an antidark soliton (the incident soli-
ton S and breather B; the outgoing soliton S(cid:48) and breather
B(cid:48)) with the conditions q1 = (3qs − q)/2, q = qs, a2
1 > a2;
q2 (cid:54)= (3qs − q)/2. (b) the corresponding intensity proﬁles |u|2
at ξ = −8 (orange), ξ = 8 (yellow). The setup is the same as
in Fig. 7, but q = qs.

For a better understanding of the characteristic of this
shape-changing characteristic of multi-peak solitons, we
next explore interspeciﬁc interactions, i.e., the interac-
tions between multi-peak solitons and other-type local-
ized nonlinear waves (breathers). Our aim is to demon-
strate that after the interspeciﬁc interaction occurs, the
multi-peak solitons exhibit intensity redistribution but
the characteristic of breathers remains invariant.

Figure 7 illustrates the interaction between multi-peak
solitons and breathers for the choice of the parameters
q1 = (3qs − q)/2, q (cid:54)= qs, q2 (cid:54)= (3qs − q)/2. One can
see from Fig. 7 that, an incident multi-peak soliton S
propagating along ξ collides with a breather near ξ = 0;
after that the outgoing soliton S(cid:48) shows a typical shape-
changing characteristic but the breather remains the orig-
inal feature. An analysis of the intensity proﬁles and the
localized energy of S and S(cid:48) shows that, after the in-
terspeciﬁc interaction with a breather occurs, the single
multi-peak soliton allows the intensity redistribution be-
tween their peaks, and preserves strictly the localized
energy of the soliton.

Finally, we illuminate that the unique shape-changing
characteristic is speciﬁc to the multi-peak solitons. To
this end, we consider the limiting case of the interac-
tion shown in Fig. 7, i.e., the collision between antidark
solitons and breathers. The corresponding interaction
structure is displayed in Fig. 8 with the limiting con-
dition q = qs.
It is shown evidently that this collision
exhibits a completely shape-unchanging feature although
the waves are two distinct types of localized waves. As a
result, a comparison of Figs. 7 and 8 indicates that, the
shape-changing feature is speciﬁc to asymmetric multi-
peak solitons and is not available for antidark solitons.
