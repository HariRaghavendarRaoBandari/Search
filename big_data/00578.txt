Abstract

This paper studies ﬂag-transitive point-primitive non-symmetric 2-(v, k, 2) designs.
We prove that if D is a non-trivial non-symmetric 2-(v, k, 2) design admitting a ﬂag-
transitive point-primitive automorphism group G with Soc(G) = An for n ≥ 5, then
D is a 2-(6, 3, 2) or 2-(10, 4, 2) design.

Introduction

A 2-(v, k, λ) design is a ﬁnite incidence structure D=(P, B) consisting of v points and b

blocks such that every block is incident with k points, every point is incident with r blocks,

and any two distinct points are incident with exactly λ blocks. The design D is called

symmetric if v = b (or equivalently r = k) and non-trivial if 1 < k < v. A ﬂag of D is an

incident point-block pair (α, B) where α is a point and B is a block. An automorphism of D

is a permutation of the points which also permutes the blocks. The set of all automorphisms

of D with the composition of maps is a group, denoted by Aut(D). A subgroup G ≤ Aut(D)

is called point-primitive if it acts primitively on P and ﬂag-transitive if it acts transitively

on the set of ﬂags of D.

It is shown in [10] that the socle of the automorphism group of a ﬂag-transitive, point-

primitive symmetric 2-(v, k, 2) design cannot be alternating or sporadic. Motivated by this

article, it is natural to consider the case of non-symmetric designs. Recently, we proved in

[7] that, for a non-symmetric 2-(v, k, 2) design, if G ≤ Aut(D) is ﬂag-transitive and point-

primitive then G must be an aﬃne or almost simple group. Moreover, if the socle of G is

sporadic, then D is the unique 2-(176, 8, 2) design with G = HS, the Higman-Sims simple

group. This article is a continuation of [7]. Here we treat almost simple groups in which

Soc(G) is an alternating group. The main result is the following.

Theorem 1.1. If D is a non-trivial non-symmetric 2-(v, k, 2) design admitting a ﬂag-

transitive point-primitive automorphism group G with alternating socle An for n ≥ 5, then

(i) D is a unique 2-(6, 3, 2) design and G = A5, or

(ii) D is a unique 2-(10, 4, 2) design and G = A5, A6 or S6.

The structure of our paper is as follows. In Section 2, we give some preliminary lemmas

on ﬂag-transitive designs and permutation groups. In Section 3, we complete the proof of

Theorem 1.1 in 5 parts.

2 Preliminaries

Lemma 2.1. The parameters v, b, r, k, λ of a non-trivial 2-(v, k, λ) design satisfy the follow-

ing arithmetic conditions:

(i) vr = bk;

(ii) λ(v − 1) = r(k − 1);

(iii) b ≥ v and k ≤ r.

In particular, if the design is non-symmetric then b > v and k < r.

Lemma 2.2. Let D be a non-trivial 2-(v, k, λ) design. Let α be a point of D and G be a

ﬂag-transitive automorphism group of D.

(i) r2 > λv and |Gα|3 > λ|G|. In particular, r2 > v.

(ii) r | λ(v − 1, |Gα|), where Gα is the stabilizer of α.

(iii) If d is any non-trivial subdegree of G, then r | λd (and so

r
(r,λ) | d).

2

Proof. (i) The equality r = λ(v−1)
k−1

implies λv = r(k − 1) + λ ≤ r(r − 1) + λ = r2 − r + λ,
and the non-triviality of D implies r > λ, and so r2 > λv. Combining this with v = |G : Gα|
and r ≤ |Gα| by the ﬂag-transitivity of G, we have |Gα|3 > λ|G|.
(ii) Since G is ﬂag-
transitive and λ(v − 1) = r(k − 1), we have r | λ(v − 1) and r | |Gα|. It follows that r divides
(λ(v − 1), |Gα|), and hence r | λ(v − 1, |Gα|). Part (iii) was proved in [2, p.91] and [3].

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.3. ([8, p.366]) If G is An or Sn, acting on a set Ω of size n, and H is any maximal
subgroup of G with H 6= An, then H satisﬁes one of the following:

(i) H = (Sℓ × Sm) ∩ G, with n = ℓ + m and ℓ 6= m (intransitive case);

(ii) H = (Sℓ ≀ Sm) ∩ G, with n = ℓm, ℓ > 1 and ℓ 6= m (imprimitive case);

(iii) H = AGLm(p) ∩ G, with n = pm and p a prime (aﬃne case);

(iv) H = (T m.(Out T ×Sm))∩G, with T a nonabelian simple group, m ≥ 2 and n = |T |m−1

(diagonal case);

(v) H = (Sℓ ≀ Sm) ∩ G, with n = ℓm, ℓ ≥ 5 and m > 1 (wreath case);

(vi) T ✂ H ≤ Aut(T ), with T a nonabelian simple group, T 6= An and H acting primitively

on Ω (almost simple case).

Remark 1. This lemma does not deal with the groups M10, P GL2(9) and P ΓL2(9) that
have A6 as socle. These exceptional cases will be handled in the ﬁrst part of Section 3.

Lemma 2.4. ([9, Theorem (b)(I)]) Let G be a primitive permutation group of odd degree n
on a set Ω with simple socle X = Soc(G), and let H = Gα, α ∈ Ω. If X ∼= Ac, an alternating
group, then one of the following holds:

(i) H is intransitive, and H = (Sa × Sc−a) ∩ G where 1 ≤ a < 1

2c;

(ii) H is transitive and imprimitive, and H = (Sa ≀ Sc/a) ∩ G where a > 1 and a | c;

(iii) H is primitive, n = 15 and G ∼= A7.

Lemma 2.5. ([5, Theorem 5.2A]) Let G = Alt(Ω) where n = |Ω| ≥ 5, and let s be an integer
with 1 ≤ s ≤ n

2 . Suppose that, K ≤ G has index |G : K| < (cid:0)n

s(cid:1). Then one of the following

holds:

3

(i) For some ∆ ⊂ Ω with |∆| < s we have G(∆) ≤ K ≤ G{∆};

(ii) n = 2m is even, K is imprimitive with two blocks of size m, and |G : K| = 1

2(cid:0) n
m(cid:1); or

(iii) one of six exceptional cases hold where:

(a) K is imprimitive on Ω and (n, s, |G : K|) = (6, 3, 15);

(b) K is primitive on Ω and (n, s, |G : K|, K) = (5, 2, 6, 5 : 2), (6, 2, 6, P SL2(5)),

(7, 2, 15, P SL3(2)), (8, 2, 15, AGL3(2)) or (9, 4, 120, P ΓL2(8)).

Remark 2. (1) From part (i) of Lemma 2.5 we know that K contains the alternating group

G(∆) = Alt(Ω\∆) of degree n − s + 1.

(2) A result similar to Lemma 2.5 holds for the ﬁnite symmetric groups Sym(Ω) which

can be found in [5, Theorem 5.2B].

We will also need some elementary inequalities.

Lemma 2.6. Let s and t be two positive integers.

s (cid:1) > 2t4 > 2s2t2.

(i) If t > s ≥ 7, then (cid:0)s+t
2(cid:1)2
(ii) If s ≥ 6 and t ≥ 2, then 2(s−1)(t−1) > 2s4(cid:0)t
2(cid:1)2
(iii) If t ≥ 6 and s ≥ 2, then 2(s−1)(t−1) > 2s4(cid:0)t
(iv) If t ≥ 4, and s ≥ 3, then (cid:0)s+t

s (cid:1) > 2s2t2 implies (cid:0)s+t+1

(cid:3)

In this section, D denotes a non-trivial non-symmetric 2-(v, k, 2) design if without special

statement, and G ≤ Aut(D) is ﬂag-transitive point-primitive with Soc(G) = An. Let α be a
point of D and H = Gα. Since G is point-primitive, H is a maximal subgroup of G by [12,
Theorem 8.2]. Furthermore, by the ﬂag-transitivity of G, we have that v = |G : H|, b | |G|,
r | |H| and r2 > 2v by Lemma 2.2 (i).

If r is odd, then (r, 2) = 1. This case has been classiﬁed by Zhou and Wang in [11], and

we get the following:

Proposition 3.1. Let D be a non-trivial non-symmetric 2-(v, k, 2) design admitting a ﬂag-

transitive point-primitive automorphism group G with Soc(G) = An, n ≥ 5. If the replication
number r is odd, then D is the unique 2-(6, 3, 2) design and G = A5.

Now we assume that r is even in the following.
Suppose ﬁrst that n = 6 and G ∼= M10, P GL2(9) or P ΓL2(9). Each of these groups has
exactly three maximal subgroups with index greater than 2, and their indices are precisely

45, 36 and 10. By using the computer algebra system GAP [6], for v = 45, 36 or 10, we will

compute the parameters (v, b, r, k) that satisfy the following conditions:

r | (2(v − 1), |H|);

r2 > 2v;

2 | r;

r(k − 1) = 2(v − 1);

r > k > 2;

b =

vr
k

;

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

We obtain two possible parameters (v, b, r, k) as follows:

5

(10, 15, 6, 4) and (36, 45, 10, 8).

Now we consider the existence of ﬂag-transitive point-primitive non-symmetric designs with

above possible parameters.

Suppose ﬁrst that there exists a 2-(10, 4, 2) design D with a ﬂag-transitive point-primitive

automorphism group G. Let the point set P = {1, 2, ..., 10}, and the group G = M10,
P GL2(9) or P ΓL2(9) as the primitive permutation group of degree 10 acting on P. Since G
is ﬂag-transitive, G acts block-transitively on B, so |G|/b = |GB|, where B is a block. For
each case, using the command Subgroups(G:OrderEqual:=n) where n = |G|/b by Magma

[1], it turns out that G has no subgroup of order n, which contradicts the fact that GB is a
subgroup of order |G|/b.

Assume next that there exists a 2-(36, 8, 2) design D with the ﬂag-transitive point-

primitive automorphism group G = M10, P GL2(9) or P ΓL2(9).

When (v, G) = (36, P ΓL2(9)), by the Magma-command Subgroups(G:OrderEqual:=n)
where n = |G|/b, we get the block stabilizer GB. Since G is ﬂag-transitive, GB is transitive
on B, and so B is an orbit of GB acting on the point set P. Using the Magma-command
Orbits(GB) where GB = GB, it turns out that GB has no orbit of length k, a contradiction.
Now assume that (v, G) = (36, M10) or (36, P GL2(9)). By the deﬁnition of 2-(v, k, λ) de-
sign, every pair of distinct points is contained in exactly λ blocks for some positive constant λ,

i.e. pairwise balanced. However, for each case, the command PairwiseBalancedLambda(D)

turns out false.

Take (v, G) = (36, M10) for example, the orbits of GB are:

∆0 ={3, 17, 18, 21},

∆1 ={1, 4, 12, 14, 16, 22, 26, 34},

∆2 ={2, 6, 7, 9, 15, 23, 29, 36},

∆3 ={5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 19, 20, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35}.

As k = 8, we take the orbit of length 8 as the block B, i.e. B = ∆1 or B = ∆2.
Using the GAP-command D1:=BlockDesign(36,[[1,4,12,14,16,22,26,34]],G), we ob-
tain that |∆G
1 | = 45 = b. We take P = {1, 2, . . . , 36}, B = ∆1 and B = BG. Now,
we just need check that each pair of distinct points is contained in 2 blocks. However,

PairwiseBlancedLambda(D1) shows that this is not true, and so B 6= ∆1. Similarly, we can
get B 6= ∆2. So the case (v, G) = (36, M10) cannot occur.

Now we consider G = An or Sn with n ≥ 5. The point stabilizer H = Gα acts both on

P and the set Ωn = {1, 2, . . . , n}. Then by Lemma 2.3 one of the following holds:

6

(i) H is primitive in its action on Ωn;

(ii) H is transitive and imprimitive in its action on Ωn;

(iii) H is intransitive in its action on Ωn.

We analyse each of these actions separately. First of all, we assume a hypothesis.

Hypothesis 1. Let D be a non-trivial non-symmetric 2-(v, k, 2) design admitting a ﬂag-

transitive point-primitive automorphism group G with Soc(G) = An (n ≥ 5) and let the
replication number r be even.

3.1 H acts primitively on Ωn

Proposition 3.2. Assume that Hypothesis 1 holds and the point stabilizer H acts primitively

on Ωn, then there exist 10 possible parameters (n, v, b, r, k) which are listed in Table 3.

Proof. We claim that 2kr. Otherwise 4 | r, from the basic equation r(k − 1) = 2(v − 1),

we have that 2 | (v − 1), and so v is odd. Thus by Lemma 2.4, v = 15, G = A7 and
|H| = |G|/v = 168. Since r | (2(v − 1), |H|), r2 > 2v and k ≥ 3, r = 7 or 14, which

contradicts 4 | r.

Thus 2kr. Since r > 2, there exists an odd prime p that divides r, then p | (v − 1), and

so (p, v) = 1. Thus H contains a Sylow p-subgroup P of G. Let g ∈ G be a p-cycle, then

there is a conjugate of g belongs to H. This implies that H acting on Ωn contains an even
permutation with exactly one cycle of length p and n − p ﬁxed points. By a result of Jordan
[12, Theorem 13.9], we have that n − p ≤ 2. Therefore, n − 2 ≤ p ≤ n, p2 ∤ |G|, and so p2 ∤ r.
It follows that r = 2(n − 2), 2(n − 1), 2n or 2n(n − 2), where n, n − 1 and n − 2 are odd
primes. Moreover, the primitivity of H acting on Ωn and H (cid:11) An imply that v ≥ [ n+1
2 ]!
2
[12, Theorem 14.2]. Combining with r2 > 2v, we have that

by

r2 > [

n + 1

2

]!.

Therefore, (n, r) = (5, 6), (5, 10), (5, 30), (6, 10), (7, 10), (7, 14), (7, 70), (8, 14), (9, 14) or
(13, 286). By Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2, the facts v ≥ [ n+1
2 ]!
2
parameters (n, v, b, r, k):

and [b, v] | |G|, we obtain 10 possible

(5, 10, 15, 6, 4), (6, 16, 40, 10, 4), (6, 36, 45, 10, 8), (7, 15, 70, 14, 3), (7, 16, 40, 10, 4),

(7, 21, 42, 10, 5), (7, 36, 45, 10, 8), (7, 36, 84, 14, 6), (8, 15, 70, 14, 3), (8, 36, 84, 14, 6).

And we list them in Table 3.

3.2 H acts transitively and imprimitively on Ωn

Proposition 3.3. Assume that Hypothesis 1 holds and the point stabilizer H acts transitively

but imprimitively on Ωn, then there exist 2 possible parameters (n, v, b, r, k) = (6, 10, 15, 6, 4)
or (10, 126, 1050, 50, 6) which are listed in Table 3.

Proof. Suppose on the contrary that Σ = {∆0, ∆1, . . . , ∆t−1} is a non-trivial partition

of Ωn preserved by H, where |∆i| = s, 0 ≤ i ≤ t − 1, s, t ≥ 2 and st = n. Then

v = (cid:18)ts − 1

s − 1(cid:19)(cid:18)(t − 1)s − 1

s − 1 (cid:19) . . .(cid:18)3s − 1

s − 1 (cid:19).
s − 1 (cid:19)(cid:18)2s − 1

Moreover, the set Oj of j-cyclic partitions with respect to X (a partition of Ωn into t
classes each of size s) is an union of orbits of H on P for j = 2, . . . , t (see [4, 13] for deﬁnitions

and details).

Case (1): Suppose ﬁrst that s = 2, then t ≥ 3, v = (2t − 1)(2t − 3) · · · 5 · 3, and

dj = |Oj| =

1

2(cid:18)t

1(cid:19)j
j(cid:19)(cid:18)s

j(cid:19).
= 2j−1(cid:18)t

We claim that t < 7. If t ≥ 7, then v = (2t − 1)(2t − 3) · · · 5 · 3 > 5t2(t − 1)2. On the other
hand, since r divides 2d2 = 2t(t − 1), 2t(t − 1) ≥ r, and so v < 2t2(t − 1)2, a contradiction.
Thus t < 7. For t = 3, 4, 5 or 6, we calculate d = 2gcd(d2, d3), which are listed in Table 1
below.

In each line r ≤ d which contradicts the fact r2 > 2v.

Case (2): Thus s ≥ 3. So Oj is an orbit of H on P, and dj = |Oj| = (cid:0)t

In particular, d2 = s2(cid:0)t

for i = 2, 3, . . . , t, we have that v > 2(s−1)(t−1). Then

2(cid:1) and r | 2d2. Moreover, from (cid:0)is−1

and so

2(cid:19)2
2(s−1)(t−1) < 2s4(cid:18)t

We will calculate all pairs (s, t) satisfying above inequality. Since 2(6−1)(6−1) = 225 >
= 25 · 36 · 52, the pair (s, t) = (6, 6) does not satisfy the inequality, but satisﬁes

the conditions of Lemma 2.6 (ii) and (iii). Thus, we have either s < 6 or t < 6. It is not

2(cid:1)2
2 · 64 · (cid:0)6

hard to get 36 pairs (s, t) satisfying the inequality:

(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5),

(4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (7, 2), (7, 3), (8, 2), (8, 3), (9, 2),

(9, 3), (10, 2), (11, 2), (12, 2), (13, 2), (14, 2), (15, 2), (16, 2), (17, 2), (18, 2).

For each pair (s, t), we calculate the parameters (v, b, r, k) satisfying Lemmas 2.1, 2.2,

2 | r and r | 2d2. There exist 2 possible parameters (n, v, b, r, k) corresponding to (s, t):

(s, t) = (3, 2) with (n, v, b, r, k) = (6, 10, 15, 6, 4),

(s, t) = (5, 2) with (n, v, b, r, k) = (10, 126, 1050, 50, 6),

which are listed in Table 3.

3.3 H acts intransitively on Ωn

(cid:3)

Proposition 3.4. Assume that Hypothesis 1 holds and the point stabilizer H acts intran-

sitively on Ωn, then there exist 15 possible parameters (n, v, b, r, k) which are listed in Table

3.

and without loss of generality, we may assume that |S| = s < n

Proof. Since H acts intransitively on Ωn, we have H = (Sym(S) × Sym(Ωn\S)) ∩ G,
2 by Lemma 2.3 (i). By the
ﬂag-transitivity of G, H is transitive on the blocks through α, and so H ﬁxes exactly one

point in P. Since H stabilizes only one s-subset of Ωn, we can identify the point α with S.
As the orbit of S under G consists of all the s-subsets of Ωn, we can identify P with the set

of s-subsets of Ωn. So v = (cid:0)n

s(cid:1), G has rank s + 1 and the subdegrees are:
s − i(cid:19), i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , s − 1.

i(cid:19)(cid:18)n − s

d0 = 1, di+1 = (cid:18)s

We claim that s ≤ 6.

Combining this with r2 > 2v, we have that 2s2(n − s)2 > (cid:0)n

s(cid:1). Since s < n

It follows from r | 2ds and ds = s(n − s) that r | 2s(n − s).
2 equals to

9

s < t = n − s, we have

s (cid:19).
2s2t2 > (cid:18)s + t

Combining this with Lemma 2.6 (i), we have s ≤ 6.

Case (1):

If s = 1, then v = n ≥ 5 and the subdegrees are 1, n − 1. If k = v − 1, then

r(v−2) = 2(v−1), and so v−2 | v−1 for (r, 2) = 2, a contradiction. Therefore, 2 < k ≤ v−2.

Since G is (v − 2)-transitive on P, G acts k-transitively on P, and so b = |B| = |BG| = (cid:0)n
k(cid:1)
for every block B ∈ B. From the equality bk = vr, we obtain (cid:0)n
k(cid:1)k = nr. On one hand, by
r(k − 1) = 2(n − 1) and k > 2, we have r ≤ n − 1, and so (cid:0)n
k(cid:1)k ≤ n(n − 1); on the other

hand, by 2 < k ≤ n − 2, we have n − i ≥ k − i + 2 > k − i + 1 for i = 2, 3, . . . , k − 1. Thus,

Case (2):

If s = 2, then v = n(n−1)

Lemma 2.2 (iii), r | 2((cid:0)n−2

2 (cid:1), 2(n − 2)).

n(n − 1) = 2v < r2 ≤ (n − 2)2, which is impossible.

(a) If n ≡ 0(mod 4) or n ≡ 2(mod 4), then r | 2((cid:0)n−2
(b) If n ≡ 1(mod 4), then r | 2((cid:0)n−2

2 (cid:1), 2(n − 2)) = 2(n − 2).

Let r = 2(n−2)

for some integer u. Since r2 > 2v, we have 4 > 4(n−2)2

u

and the subdegrees are 1, (cid:0)n−2

2 (cid:1), 2(n − 2). By
2 (cid:1), 2(n − 2)) = n − 2, it follows that

n(n−1) > u2, which forces
. Since k and b

u = 1. Therefore, r = 2(n − 2). By Lemma 2.1, k = n+3
are integers, (n + 3) | 120 with n odd. Combining this with n ≡ 1(mod 4), we get that n=5,

2 and b = 2n(n−1)(n−2)

n+3

9, 17, 21, 37, 57 or 117. For each n, we calculate the parameters (v, b, r, k). We ﬁnd that if

n ∈ {17, 21, 37, 57, 117}, then |G : GB| = b < (cid:0)n

3(cid:1). By Lemma 2.5 and [5, Theorem 5.2B], it

is easy to know that G has no subgroup of index b, a contradiction. So we obtain 2 possible

parameters (n, v, b, r, k):

(5, 10, 15, 6, 4), (9, 36, 84, 14, 6).

(c) If n ≡ 3(mod 4), then r | 2((cid:0)n−2

Let r = 4(n−2)

2 (cid:1), 2(n − 2)) = 4(n − 2).

u

for some integer u. Since r2 > 2v, we have 16 > 16(n−2)2

n(n−1) > u2, and so

u = 1, 2 or 3.

If u = 1, then r = 4(n − 2), k = n+5
4

and b = 8n(n−1)(n−2)

n+5

. As b must be an integer,

(n + 5) | 1680. Combining with n ≡ 3(mod 4), we have that n=7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 35, 43, 51,

55, 75, 79, 107, 115, 135, 163, 235, 275, 331, 415, 555, 835 or 1675. Similarly, by Lemma

2.5 and [5, Theorem 5.2B], n ∈ {7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 35, 43} and we obtain 7 possible parameters

10

(n, v, b, r, k):

(7, 21, 140, 20, 3), (11, 55, 495, 36, 4), (15, 105, 1092, 52, 5), (19, 171, 1938, 68, 6),

(23, 253, 3036, 84, 7), (35, 595, 7854, 132, 10), (43, 903, 12341, 164, 12).

If u = 2, then r = 2(n − 2), k = n+3

2 and b = 2n(n−1)(n−2)

n+3

, and so (n + 3) | 120. Combining

with n ≡ 3(mod 4), we have that n = 7 or 27. By Lemma 2.5 and [5, Theorem 5.2B], n 6= 27,

so we obtain a possible parameter (n, v, b, r, k) = (7, 21, 42, 10, 5).

If u = 3, then r = 4(n−2)

3

, k = 3n+7

4

and b = 8n(n−1)(n−2)

3(3n+7)

, and so (3n + 7) | 7280. The facts

that r is an integer and n ≡ 3(mod 4) imply n = 11, 35, 119 or 1211. For each n, we ﬁnd

|G : GB| = b < (cid:0)n

3(cid:1). By Lemma 2.5 and [5, Theorem 5.2B], it is easy to know that G has no

subgroup of index b, a contradiction.

Case (3):

Suppose that 3 ≤ s ≤ 6. Now for each value of s, by the inequality

2s2t2 > (cid:0)s+t
let s = 3, since (cid:0)3+102

s (cid:1) and Lemma 2.6 (iv), we know that t (and hence n) is bounded. For example,
3 (cid:1) > 2 · 32 · 1022, we must have 4 ≤ t ≤ 101, and so 7 ≤ n ≤ 104. The

bounds of n are listed in Table 2 below.

Note that v = (cid:0)n

s(cid:1), and d1 = (cid:0)n−s

s (cid:1), d2 = s(cid:0)n−s

s−1(cid:1), d3 = (cid:0)s

2(cid:1)(cid:0)n−s

s−2(cid:1) are three non-trivial

subdegrees of G acting on P. Therefore, the 5-tuple (n, v, b, r, k) satisﬁes the arithmetical

conditions: (3.1)-(3.6) and r | 2di, i ∈ {1, 2, 3}.
If s = 3, using GAP, it outputs ﬁve 5-tuples:

(13, 286, 429, 30, 20), (14, 364, 2002, 66, 12), (22, 1540, 6270, 114, 28),

(32, 4960, 14880, 174, 58), (50, 19600, 39480, 282, 140).

If s = 4, 5 or 6, using GAP, there is no parameter (n, v, b, r, k) satisfying these conditions.

Thus, we totally obtain 15 possible parameters (n, v, b, r, k) and list them in Table 3.

3.4 Rules out potential parameters

Now, we will rule out 23 potential cases listed in Table 3 in several steps.

(i) Rules out Cases 6, 7, 11 and 12.

The GAP-command PrimitiveGroup(v,nr) returns the primitive group with degree v

in the position nr in the list of the library of the primitive permutation groups. For each

Case, the command shows that there is no primitive group corresponding to v.

(ii) Rules out Cases 1 and 8.

Since G is ﬂag-transitive, |H| = |G|/v. For each case, H is primitive on Ωn. However,
the command PrimitiveGroup(v,nr), where v = n, turns out that there is no group of

order |G|/v.

12

(iii) Rules out Cases 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23 and 25.

Since G is ﬂag-transitive, G acts transitively on B, so |G|/b = |GB|, where B is a block.
For each case, using the Magma-command Subgroups(G:OrderEqual:=n) where n = |G|/b,

it turns out that G has no subgroup of order n, which contradicts the fact that GB is a
subgroup of order |G|/b. When v ≥ 2500, the GAP-command PrimitiveGroup(v,nr) does

not know the group of degree v. For Case 25, G = A50 or S50, we use the Magma-command
G := Alt(50) or G := Sym(50) to get the group G, and Subgroups(G:OrderEqual:=n) where

n = |G|/b to get that G does not have such a subgroup of order |G|/b, a contradiction.

(iv) Rules out Cases 13, 14, 17, 20 and 22.

Since GB is transitive on B, B is an orbit of GB acting on the point set P. Using the
Magma-command Orbits(GB), where GB = GB, it turns out that GB has no orbit of length
b, a contradiction.

(v) Rules out Cases 3 and 5.

Using the command Orbits(GB), we get the orbits of GB. As |B| = k, we take the orbit
of length k as the block B. Since G acts transitively on B, |BG| = b. However, for each case,
using the GAP-command OrbitLength(G,B,OnSets), we get that |BG| < b, a contradiction.

Take Case 3, (v, G) = (10, A5) for example, the orbits of GB are:

∆0 = {1, 8}, ∆1 = {2, 6}, ∆2 = {3, 5}, ∆3 = {4, 7, 9, 10}.

So B = ∆3 = {4, 7, 9, 10}. However, OrbitLength(G,[4,7,9,10],OnSets) turns out
|BG| = 5 < 15, a contradiction.

(vi) Rules out Cases 9 and 10.

For each case, the GAP-command PairwiseBalancedLambda(D) turns out false, which

means that D is not pairwise balanced, contradicting the deﬁnition of design.

For Case 9, take (v, G) = (21, A7) for example, the orbits of GB are:

∆0 = {13},
∆2 = {4, 9, 16, 19, 20}, ∆3 = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18, 21}.

∆1 = {2, 7, 12, 14, 15},

As k = 5, we take the orbit of length 5 as the block B, i.e. B = ∆1 or B = ∆2. Using
the GAP-command D := BlockDesign(21, [[2, 7, 12, 14, 15]], G), we obtain that |∆G
1 | = 42 and
1 . Without loss of generality, we take P = {1, 2, . . . , 21}, B = ∆1 and B = ∆G
∆2 ∈ ∆G
1 .
Now, we just need check that D is pairwise balanced. However, PairwiseBalancedLambda(D)

shows that this is not true. So the case (v, G) = (21, A7) cannot occur.

(vii) Rules out Case 24.

Consider ﬁrst that (v, G) = (4960, A32). Let Ωn = {1, 2, . . . , 32}, then G acts primitively
denote the set of all 3-subsets (that is, subsets of size 3) of Ωn.

on Ωn. Let P = Ω{3}
n

13

Then G acts on P in a natural way, namely: (α1, α2, α3)g = (αg
and |P| = (cid:0)32

3(cid:1) = 4960. Using the Magma-command G := Alt(32) to get the group G,

and Subgroups(G:OrderEqual:=n) where n = |G|/b to know that G contains only one

1, αg

2, αg

3) for all g ∈ G

conjugacy class of subgroups of order |G|/b, denoted by K, so the block stabilizer GB is
conjugate to K, and then there is a block B0 such that K = GB0. Since G is ﬂag-transitive,
K is transitive on B0, that is, B0 is an orbit of K acting on P. Take S = {1, 2, 3} ∈ P.
Using the command OrbitLength(G, S, OnSets), we have that G acts transitively on P, and
using the command OrbitLength(K, S′, OnSets) for all S′ ∈ P, we get that K acting on P

has exactly only one orbit Γ of length 58. As k = 58, we take B0 = Γ. Furthermore, the
Magma-command O := Γ∧G turns out that |O| = 14880 = b, and then we take B = O. Now, we

just need check that each pair of distinct points is contained in 2 blocks. Let S1 = {1, 2, 3},
S2 = {5, 6, 9} ∈ P. Using Magma, it is easy to know that there is no block in B containing
both S1 and S2 , a contradiction. So the case (v, G) = (4960, A32) cannot occur.

The analysis of (v, G) = (4960, S32) is the same as above. Let P = Ω{3}

n and G acts on P

in the natural way. Using GAP and Magma, we get the group G, the subgroup K = GB0 of
order |G|/b, and the orbit Γ (|Γ| = 58) of K acting on P. Since G is ﬂag-transitive, G acts
transitively on B, and so |ΓG| = 14880. Using the Magma-command

M := PermutationGroup < 32|(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)(12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,

20, 21, 22, 23, 24)(25, 26, 27), (9, 11, 15), (4, 13, 21) >,

we get a subgroup M < G, and so |ΓM | ≤ 14880. However, O := Γ∧M turns out that

|O| = 36432 > 14880, a contradiction. So the case (v, G) = (4960, S32) is ruled out.

(cid:3)

3.5 The unique non-symmetric 2-(10, 4, 2) design

For Case 2, (v, G) = (10, A6), using the GAP-command PrimitiveGroup(10,3), we
∼= P SL(2, 9) acting on the set
get the primitive permutation representations of G = A6
P = {1, 2, . . . , 10}. By Magma, it is easy to know that G contains two conjugacy classes of

subgroups of order 24, denoted by K1 and K2 as representatives. As G acts ﬂag-transitively,
for any B ∈ B, |GB| = |G|/b = 24, so GB is conjugate to either K1 or K2.

Assume ﬁrst that GB is conjugate to K1, then there exists a block B0 such that K1 = GB0.
By the ﬂag-transitivity of G, B0 is an orbit of K1 acting on P. The Magma-command
Orbits(K1), where K1 = K1, turns out that the lengths of the orbits of K1 are 4 and 6. As
|B0| = k = 4, we take the orbit of length 4 as the block B0. Using GAP, we obtain that

14

G| = 15 and every pair of distinct points is contained in exactly 2 blocks. Therefore,
|B0
we get a point-primitive non-symmetric 2-(10, 4, 2) design, denoted by D1. Since G acts
transitively on B and GB0 acts transitively on B0, G acts ﬂag-transitively on D1. Thus, we
get a desired ﬂag-transitive point-primitive 2-(10, 4, 2) non-symmetric design D1.

Consider next that GB is conjugate to K2. By Magma, we obtain that the orbits of K2
are {2, 6, 7, 10} and {1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}, and so we take B0 = {2, 6, 7, 10}. Similarly, by the facts
that |BG
0 | = 15 and every pair of distinct points is contained in exactly 2 blocks, we get a

ﬂag-transitive point-primitive 2-(10, 4, 2) non-symmetric design D2.

The analysis of Case 2, (v, G) = (10, S6) is the same as above, here the group G is
PrimitiveGroup(10,5). There are two conjugacy classes of subgroups of order 48, denoted

by M1 and M2 as representatives. The orbits of M1 are {2, 4, 6, 8} and {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}, and
G| = 15 and every pair of distinct
so we take B0 = {2, 4, 6, 8}. Using GAP, we get that |B0
points is contained in exactly 2 blocks, and so we obtain a 2-(10, 4, 2) design D3 as desired.
The lengths of the orbits of M2 are 4 and 6, and so we take the orbit of size 4 as the block
B0, which satisﬁes |B0

G| = 15 and λ = 2, hence, we get a desired design D4.

For Case 4, we get the primitive group G = S5 by PrimitiveGroup(10,2). Using the
command Subgroups(G:OrderEqual:=n) where n = |G|/b, we know that there is exactly

only one conjugacy class of subgroups of order 8, denoted by L, so the block stabilizer GB is
conjugate to L, and then there is a block B0 such that L = GB0. Orbits(L) gives the orbits
of L:

∆0 = {3, 5}, ∆1 = {1, 2, 6, 8}, ∆2 = {4, 7, 9, 10}.

So either B0 = ∆1 or B0 = ∆2. If B0 = ∆2, OrbitLength(G,[4,7,9,10],OnSets) shows
that |BG
0 | = 5 < 15, a contradiction. If B0 = ∆1, D := BlockDesign(10, [[1, 2, 6, 8]], G) shows
that |BG
0 | = 15, and PairwiseBalancedLambda(D) gives λ = 2. We take P = {1, 2, . . . , 10},
B0 = ∆1 and B = BG
0 . Therefore, we construct a non-symmetric 2-(10, 4, 2) design D5,
which is ﬂag-transitive and point-primitive.

The GAP-command IsIsomorphicBlockDesign(D1,D2) turns out true when D1 = D1
and D2 = D2, D3, D4 or D5. So up to isomorphism we take these ﬁve designs as the same
design, denoted by D.

This completes the proof of Theorem 1.1.
