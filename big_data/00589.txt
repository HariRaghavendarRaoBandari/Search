Abstract—Open and anonymous nature of peer to peer net-
works provides an opportunity to malicious peers to behave
unpredictably in the network. This leads the lack of
trust
among the peers. To control
the behavior of peers in the
network, reputation system can be used. In a reputation system,
aggregation of trust is a primary issue. Algorithm for aggregation
of trust should be designed such that, it can converge to a certain
ﬁnite value. Absolute Trust is one of the algorithm, which is used
for the aggregation of trust in peer to peer networks. In this
letter, we present the generalized analysis of convergence of the
Absolute Trust algorithm.

Index Terms—Non-negative matrix, Eigenvector, Matrix Norm.

I. INTRODUCTION

R EPUTATION systems have been proposed by many

authors in the recent past [1], [5], [6], [7], [8], to prevent
the attacks by rogue peers. Absolute Trust [1] is one such
model. This model can characterize the past behavior of peers
in the network. It can be implemented as a truly distributed
system. In this model, peers evaluate each other locally, and
the local
trust for each other is aggregated in the whole
network. The aggregated trust is called global trust. The global
trust is evaluated recursively.

In recursive solution of any equation, error in each iteration
must reduce and for large number of iteration it should tend
to zero. This will guarantee the uniqueness of the solution. It
was shown in [1] that if error in global trust is less compare to
the actual solution, then it will converge to zero. But analysis
for large error was not presented. In this letter, we will show
that in any step, if error is very large compared to the actual
solution then it will converge much faster in that step.

II. PEER TO PEER MODEL AND ABSOLUTE TRUST

Let there be N peers in a peer to peer network. In this
network, peer i can be evaluated by peer j based on service
provided by peer i in the past. Evaluated value Tji can be
represented by a number from one to ten. One is for worst
service and ten is for best service. If there is no interaction
between peers, Tji will be zero. Tji is called local trust of
peer i evaluated by peer j. All local trust values evaluated
by various nodes can be aggregated in the whole network.
Aggregated global trust of peer i can be given by [1]

Here, t is global trust vector. Its ith entry is a global trust
of peer i. diag(t) is a diagonal matrix with its ii entry as ti
and other entry as zero. T is trust matrix with its element Tij
as a local trust of peer j evaluated by peer i. Tt is transpose
of matrix T. C is incidence matrix corresponding to matrix
Tt i.e. Cij = 1 if Tji > 0 otherwise Cij = 0. ei is the row
vector with its ith entry as ’1’ and all the other entry as zero.
Here, α = q/p.

III. ANALYSIS OF CONVERGENCE OF ABSOLUTE TRUST

A. Center Point of the Matrix
Deﬁnition 1. Center point of non-negative matrix Tt can be
deﬁned as the column vector t. Where, its ith element ti will
be (eiTtt/eiCt).
Deﬁnition 2. A non-negative matrix M is said to be mutually
exclusive with a non-negative matrix N, if Mij > 0 implies
Nij = 0. It also implies that when Nij > 0 then Mij = 0
Lemma 1. Center point of any non-negative,
irreducible
matrix Tt is unique and can be calculated by an iterative
function

tk = φ1(tk−1) = [diag(d1, d2....dN )]−1.Tt.tk−1

where di = eiCt
Proof. ith element of iterative function φ1(tk−1) is

tk
i =

(eiTt.tk−1)
(eiC.tk−1)

Let tk

i and tk−1
respectively, then

= fi(δtk−1).(cid:20)Ai − Bi(cid:21).δtk−1

where Ai and Bi are ith row of N XN matrices A and B
respectively. It can be observed easily that

2

Proof. Iterative function can be written as

tk = M(k − 1).tk−1

= M(k − 1).M(k − 2)....M(0).t0

eiC.tk

where ith row of matrix M(k) is(cid:0) eiC.diag(tk)

prove that for matrix M(k), sum of its each row is one. Hence
it has ’1’ as an eigen value. The corresponding eigen vector
will be e. For positive initial guess of t0, all matrices M(k)
will be non-negative and irreducible. So we can conclude that
spectral radius of all M(k) is ’1’. Hence (see Lemma 2 in
[1])

(cid:1). We can easily

limk→∞tk = limk→∞M(k − 1).M(k − 2)....M(0).t0 = e

limk→∞tk = limk→∞φ2(tk−1) = e

B. Properties of Center Point
Property 1. If center point of matrix M is t then center point
of matrix kM will be kt. Where k is any arbitrary scalar.

Proof. Let ti is ith element of t then
ei.M.t
ei.C.t

ti =

and

A.t = t

B.t = t.

or

or

Matrices A, B have non zero elements at same position as
matrix Tt, hence A, B are also irreducible. Therefore spectral
radius of A, B will be ’1’(see[2]).

Now

fi(δtk−1) =

1

(1 + ei.C.δtk−1

ei.C.t

)

If δtk−1 << t then fi(δtk−1) ≈ 1

Hence,

δtk =(cid:2)A − B(cid:3).δtk−1

limk→∞δtk = limk→∞[A − B]kδt0 = 0

(see Theorem 1 in [1]) here δt0 is initial error in t

Now, for the case when δtk−1 > t then fi(δtk−1) < 1, in
i will decrease more rapidly. If δtk−1 ≈ t then
i will reduced to half

each step, δtk
fi(δtk−1) ≈ 1/2, in this case each δtk
in kth step.

Hence we can conclude that center point of any non neg-
ative, irreducible matrix can be calculated by above iterative
function. Error in each step will depend upon the error in past
step. Error will reduce very fast, if it is far from actual solution
in an step and after large iterations it will go to zero.

Lemma 2. If vector t is the center point of matrix C.diag(t),
then center point will lie on the vector e. It can be calculated
by iterative function

tk = φ2(tk−1) = [diag(d1, d2....dN )]−1.C.diag(tk−1).tk−1

where e is a vector with each element as ’1’ and di = eiCt.

kti =

ei.kM.t
ei.C.t

ei.(kM).(kt)

(kti) =

ei.C.(kt)
hence kt is center point of matrix kM

Property 2.
If all entries of the N XN matrix M are
positive(Mij > 0 ∀i, j ) then center point will lie on the
principle eigen vector of matrix.

Proof. If all the entry of matrix M are positive then

N

ei.C.t =

Xj=1

tj = λ

∀i

=

ei.M.t

λ

.

Here λ is a constant. Further,
ei.M.t
ei.C.t

ti =

Hence Mt = λt. Hence λ will be spectral radius and t will
be principle eigen vector of matrix M (see[2])

Property 3. If center point of m non-negative, irreducible and
mutually exclusive matrices M1, M2....Mm are same, then
the center point of their sum will also be the same.

Proof. Let
the incidence matrix corresponding to matri-
ces M1, M2....Mm are C1, C2....Cm respectively. Now if
M = M1 + M2 + ....Mm then incidence matrix correspond-
ing to matrix M will be C = C1 + C2 + ....Cm because ma-
trices M1, M2....Mm are mutually exclusive. Let ith element
of center point of matrices M1, M2....Mm be ti then

ti =

ei.Mj.t
ei.Cj.t

∀j

hence t is also the center point of matrix M.

the center point then it will tend toward the center point very
rapidly. Hence for δtk−1 > t

C. Convergence of Absolute Trust for Large Error in Initial
Guess

It was stated in [1] that global trust in equation 1 can be

calculated by iterative function

tk = φ(tk−1) = [diag(d1, d2....dN )Tt.tk−1]

1

1+α

(cid:21). Proof was derived only

where di =(cid:20)(cid:0)eiC.diag(tk−1).tk−1(cid:1)α
(cid:0)eiCtk−1(cid:1)(1+α)

for the small error that is, if initial guess of t is very close to
the actual solution. However global trust can be calculated for
any positive initial guess. In this subsection we will show that
it will converge faster in any step if error is large compared
to t.

Let tk

i and tk−1
respectively, then

i

δtk−1

i

are, far from actual solution ti by δtk

i and

then we

can

(cid:0)eiC.δtk−1(cid:1)

Using Young’s Inequality [4], i.e.

Therefore error in every step will decrease. In any step, it will
decrease faster if tk is very far from actual solution. Speed of
convergence depends upon the α. For lower α, impact of φ2
will be lower and φ1 will dominate the speed of convergence.
Hence for smaller α speed of convergence will be high.

A. Convergence of the Center Point

The convergence of center point of matrix Tt is shown in
Table I and II. In Table I initial guess t0 =[1 2 3 4]t, it is close
to the center point and in Table II initial guess t0 =[100 300
200 100]t, which is signiﬁcantly far from center point. But
we can see in both the cases that it will converge in seven
iterations . In the latter case, error is very large in 0th step
and it becomes less then t with in one step.

B. Convergence of the Global Trust

Impact of initial guess and parameter α on the convergence
of global trust is shown in Table III, IV and V. In Table III and
IV α is taken as 1/3 but initial guess is different. Again we
can see that for large initial guess of global trust it takes only
one more iteration to converge to ﬁnal value. It converge very
fast when error(δt) is very large compare to global trust(t)

In Table III and V initial guess is taken same but α is
different and we can see that for α = 1/6 it converges only
in eight iterations.

V. CONCLUSION

In this letter, we analyzed the convergence of global trust
given by equation 1. We have shown that in recursive calcula-
tion of global trust, error will decrease even if initial guess is
very far from the actual solution. In any step, convergence
is faster if error is larger. We have shown that speed of
convergence depends upon the value of α. For smaller α it
will converge more faster.
