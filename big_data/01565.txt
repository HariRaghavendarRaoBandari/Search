ABSTRACT

Context. The prediction of the PLANCK-constrained primordial lithium abundance in the Universe is in discordance with the ob-
served Li abundances in warm Population II dwarf and subgiant stars. Among the physically best motivated ideas, it has been
suggested that this discrepancy can be alleviated if the stars observed today had undergone photospheric depletion of lithium.
Aims. The cause of this depletion is investigated by accurately tracing the behaviour of the lithium abundances as a function of
eﬀective temperature. Globular clusters are ideal laboratories for such an abundance analysis as the relative stellar parameters of their
stars can be precisely determined.
Methods. We performed a homogeneous chemical abundance analysis of 144 stars in the metal-poor globular cluster M30, ranging
from the cluster turnoﬀ point to the tip of the red giant branch. Non-local thermal equilibrium (NLTE) abundances for Li, Ca, and Fe
were derived where possible by ﬁtting spectra obtained with VLT/FLAMES-GIRAFFE using the quantitative-spectroscopy package
SME. Stellar parameters were derived by matching isochrones to the observed V vs V − I colour-magnitude diagram. Independent
eﬀective temperatures were obtained from automated proﬁle ﬁtting of the Balmer lines and by applying colour-Teﬀ calibrations to the
broadband photometry.
Results. Li abundances of the turnoﬀ and early subgiant stars form a thin plateau that is broken oﬀ abruptly in the middle of the SGB
as a result of the onset of Li dilution caused by the ﬁrst dredge-up. Abundance trends with eﬀective temperature for Fe and Ca are
observed and compared to predictions from stellar structure models including atomic diﬀusion and ad hoc additional mixing below
the surface convection zone. The comparison shows that the stars in M30 are aﬀected by atomic diﬀusion and additional mixing, but
we were unable to determine the eﬃciency of the additional mixing precisely. This is the fourth globular cluster (after NGC 6397,
NGC 6752, and M4) in which atomic diﬀusion signatures are detected. After applying a conservative correction (T6.0 model) for
atomic diﬀusion, we ﬁnd an initial Li abundance of A(Li) = 2.48 ± 0.10 for the globular cluster M30.
We also detected a Li-rich SGB star with a Li abundance of A(Li) = 2.39. The ﬁnding makes Li-rich mass transfer a likely scenario
for this star and rules out models in which its Li enhancement is created during the RGB bump phase.

1. Introduction

The primordial abundance of lithium is traced from observations
of warm metal-poor turnoﬀ stars in the halo of our Galaxy.

with a metallicity range −3.0 < [Fe/H]1< −1.0 is found to be
almost independent of metallicity, displaying a plateau (Spite &
Spite 1982). Although lithium in surface layers of stars can be
destroyed as a result of convective motions – surface material
can be dragged into the hot stellar interior, where lithium is
readily destroyed by proton capture – lithium is not or scarcely
aﬀected in the hottest (Teﬀ> 6000 K) and most massive un-
evolved halo stars since these have only a thin convection layer.
For these stars, lithium shows no correlation with temperature.

ements X and Y.

This is the Spite plateau.
If one assumes that lithium is not
being destroyed during the pre-main sequence phase and it is
not depleted at the surface of the stars so that the currently
observed abundance is equal to the initial one, the Spite plateau
level ought to measure the primordial abundance of lithium.
The small scatter around the Spite plateau can be interpreted
as an indication that depletion of lithium cannot have been
very eﬀective and did not vary much from star to star. Several
groups (e.g. Ryan et al. 1999; Charbonnel & Primas 2005;
Asplund et al. 2006; Bonifacio et al. 2007; Aoki et al. 2009;
Hosford et al. 2010; Meléndez et al. 2010) have undertaken
great eﬀort to measure lithium abundances of halo stars to create
suﬃcient samples where the dominant errors are systematic in
origin. These eﬀorts have led to a value for the Spite plateau of
2.20 ± 0.09 (Sbordone et al. 2010). This is signiﬁcantly lower
than the prediction for the initial Li abundance of the Universe
of N(7Li)/N(H)= (4.68 ± 0.67) × 10−10 or A(Li)= 2.66 ± 0.062,
obtained from standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) based
on the most recent determination of the baryon density from the
PLANCK data Ωbh2 = 0.022305±0.000225 (Cyburt et al. 2015).

During the past decade, advances in theoretical modelling of
stellar structure were made. Where the canonical models do not
predict Li destruction during the main-sequence lifetime of a Pop
II star, stellar structure models by Richard et al. (2005) based on
the work by Michaud et al. (1984) revealed that the low Li values
found in old, metal-poor stars can be naturally explained.

Richard et al. (2005) showed that the low Li abundances
observed in stars are a result of Li depletion by atomic dif-
fusion in competition with an additional transport or mixing
process (hereafter AddMix) in the radiative zones of Pop II
stars. By using sophisticated stellar models that treat atomic
diﬀusion including radiative acceleration from ﬁrst principles
and calibrated on the Sun, and assuming rather strict limits
on the extent and eﬃciency of AddMix, Richard et al. (2005)
found they could produce a Li plateau for Pop II stars that is
∼ 0.3 dex depleted from the BBN value. The extent of AddMix
is mainly due to the density, which falls oﬀ as ρ−3 (using solar
models while trying to represent Li destruction but avoiding Be
destruction) and depends to a lesser extent also on the eﬃciency.
The eﬃciency can be empirically constrained by the A(Li) value
of the plateau and abundance trends of heavier elements.

Although a number of suggestions have been made towards
the physical origin of AddMix (mass loss, rotation-induced
mixing, etc.), the true underlying mechanism is still unknown.
To further our knowledge about the intrinsic stellar processes
involved, we turn to stars in metal-poor Galactic globular
clusters. All stars in globular clusters are, to ﬁrst approximation,
born at the same time. This allows the evolutionary status of the
observed stars to be determined unambiguously. And although
the surface metallicities observed today may vary between stars
in diﬀerent evolutionary phases, due to the eﬀects of atomic
diﬀusion, e.g. Korn et al. (2007); Lind et al. (2008); Nordlander
et al. (2012); Gruyters et al. (2013, 2014), all stars were also
born with the same (iron-peak) metallicity.

At a metallicity of [Fe/H] = −2.3, M30 (NGC 7099) is one
of the most metal-poor globular clusters in the Milky Way. Its
location far from the Galactic plane ensures a low reddening.
However, given its large distance of 8.3 ± 0.2 kpc (Kains et al.

2 A(Li)= log N(Li)

2013) and an absolute visual magnitude of V = 7.1 3, the globu-
lar cluster M30 is a faint target with typical turnoﬀ point (TOP)
stellar magnitudes of V ∼ 18.5 mag. This makes it very hard
to obtain good quality spectra from turnoﬀ stars and even more
diﬃcult to precisely analyse them. It is also probably one of the
reasons why, to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to study
the chemical content of TOP stars in this cluster. Information on
the chemical content of red giant branch (RGB) stars of M30 has
been presented by Carretta et al. (2009). They detected a weak
sodium-oxygen anticorrelation in their observed RGB stars. This
anticorrelation is thought to be the direct result of the pollution
of the star-forming gas by short-lived intermediate-mass or mas-
sive stars of the ﬁrst generation of globular cluster stars (Prantzos
& Charbonnel 2006; Decressin et al. 2007; D’Ercole et al. 2010;
Krause et al. 2013; Ventura et al. 2013; Denissenkov & Hartwick
2014). During their short lifetimes, these stars eject hydrogen-
processed material and contaminate the intra-cluster gas from
which a subsequent generation of stars is formed. Compared to
the pristine cluster composition, the pollution mechanism will
increase the Na abundances while lowering the O abundances
in the cluster gas, making all second-generation long-lived low-
mass stars seem chemically diﬀerent from their ﬁrst-generation
counterparts. The observed anticorrelation in M30 thus presents
evidence that M30 is harbouring at least two stellar generations.
As Na also theoretically anticorrelates with Li, the same mech-
anism will lower the Li abundance in second-generation stars as
the more massive stars are hotter and thus burn the Li before it
is returned to the interstellar medium. Thus, if we wish to obtain
the primordial value of Li, we have to ﬁnd a way to disentangle
the eﬀects of atomic diﬀusion and intrinsic stellar depletion from
early cluster pollution (Lind et al. 2009b; Nordlander et al. 2012;
Gruyters et al. 2014).
In this work we present the results of a homogeneous abundance
analysis of 144 stars in M30. We derived non-local thermal equi-
librium (NLTE) abundances for Li, Ca, and Fe in an attempt to
trace the evolution of Li and derive new constrains on atomic
diﬀusion and additional mixing. The outline of the paper is as
follows. Section 2 describes the data sets, in Sect. 3 we present
our analysis, and the results are given in Sect. 4. These results
are discussed in Sect. 5, and a summary of the work can be found
in Sect. 6.

2. Observations
2.1. Photometry and target selection

The observations of stars in M30 are based on a carefully se-
lected sample of 150 stars. The selection of stars was made
on uvby Strömgren photometry obtained with the Danish 1.54m
telescope on La Silla, Chile (Grundahl et al. 1999) and designed
to obtain a homogenous sample covering all evolutionary phases
and populations from the TOP to the tip of the RGB in the globu-
lar cluster (GC) M30. The focus of this study, however, lies upon
the TOP as we aim to obtain a measurement of the Li abundance
in M30.
No standard star observations were made during the observing
run, therefore the photometry could not be properly calibrated
and hence cannot be used to obtain precise stellar parameters.
Instead, we used VI broadband photometry from Peter Stetson
(Stetson 2000, 2005) to derive photometric stellar parameters.
The photometry is displayed in Fig. 1, which shows the V − I

(−188± 5 km s−1) and Harris (1996) (−184.2± 0.2 km s−1, latest
web update (2010)).

2.2. Spectroscopy

We collected 20 exposures of 45 min centred on the globular
cluster M30, using the FLAMES instrument on VLT-UT2, ESO
Paranal (Pasquini et al. 2003). Approximately 100 ﬁbres, con-
nected to the medium-resolution spectrograph GIRAFFE, were
allocated to stars in all evolutionary stages between the cluster
TO point at V = 18.5 and the tip of the RGB at V = 12.5.
As only the faintest targets required 20 exposures to obtain the
required signal-to-noise ratio, we used two diﬀerent ﬁbre con-
ﬁgurations. This allowed us to switch ﬁbres for the brighter
stars. In total, we collected data for 150 stars using the setup
HR15N H665.5 (R ≈ 20 000). A minor fraction (four stars) of
the data had to be discarded because of crosstalk between ad-
jacent bright and faint objects on the CCD. Simultaneously, we
collected high-resolution spectra with the UVES spectrograph
for 13 RGB stars in total, using the standard setup centred on
580 nm. In this paper we focus on the GIRAFFE data set, the
UVES data will be analysed and discussed in a subsequent pa-
per.
The data were reduced with the dedicated ESO-maintained
pipelines and further processed in IDL. For the majority of
GIRAFFE targets, 20 individual exposures were co-added af-
ter sky-subtraction and radial-velocity correction.
In this pro-
cess, one foreground star (id 200161) with radial velocity
−65 km s−1was identiﬁed, as well as clear signs of binarity for
one SGB star (id 62198). These stars were excluded from the
analysis. The mean heliocentric radial velocity of the cluster was
found to be −187 km s−1, with a dispersion of σ = 3 km s−1and

3. Analysis
3.1. Effective temperature

The eﬀective temperatures for the target stars were derived by
ﬁtting Victoria isochrones (VandenBerg et al. 2014) transposed
to the V–(V − I) colour-magnitude space using the latest
synthetic colour transformations of Casagrande & VandenBerg
(2014) (see Fig. 1). The Victoria isochrones are similar to the
Montreal-Montpellier isochrones (for a comparison see e.g.
VandenBerg et al. 2002, 2012), the only diﬀerence being that
the models do not include radiative acceleration of elements
or additional mixing. The best ﬁt to the photometry is given
by an isochrone with an age of 13.4 Gyr and a reddening of
E(V − I) = 0.037. The distance modulus corresponding to this
best ﬁt is 14.73 and falls in between 14.64 and 14.82, the values
given in the Harris catalogue (Harris 1996, latest web update
(2010)) and by Dotter et al. (2010), respectively. Even though
we also tried BaSTI (Pietrinferni et al. 2013) and Dartmouth
isochrones (Dotter et al. 2008),
the Victoria isochrones are
the only isochrones that can reproduce the morphology of
the cluster within a reasonable parameter space (age <15Gyr,
Teﬀ(TOP)< 6600 K).

The eﬀective temperatures were then obtained by projecting
the stars onto the isochrone along the line of shortest distance
perpendicular to the isochrone. This ensures that the shift in
colour will not become unphysically large on the ﬂat part of the
colour-magnitude diagram (CMD), the SGB. We compared the

on published relations between Teﬀ and V−I colour indices, both
calibrated on the infra-red ﬂux method (Blackwell et al. 1986,
IRFM). A ﬁrst relation we adopted from Alonso et al. (1996)
and Alonso et al. (1999, hereafter these two papers are referred
to as Al96+99).

As a second calibration we combined the calibrations by
Casagrande et al. (2010, Cas10 hereafter) for the TO and SGB
stars, with the calibration by Ramírez & Meléndez (2005, RM05
hereafter) for the RGB stars. A zero-point correction of +100
K was applied to the RM05 scale to bring RM05 to the same
scale as that of Cas10 and allow for a smooth connection to
the colour-Teﬀ relation of the less evolved stars. For all stars
we assumed [Fe/H]= −2.3 when applying the relations. As
IRFM colour-Teﬀ relations are constructed for either dwarfs
(log g (cid:62) 3.8) or giants (log g (cid:54) 3.5), we interpolated linearly
between each dwarf- and giant-calibration pair to obtain a
smooth calibration for the SGB. The interpolation was made for
a V − I range between 0.62 and 0.8 mag.
Figure 2 shows the three V − I-based Teﬀ scales as a function
of log g. While the Victoria and Alonso eﬀective temperature
scales are oﬀset by 150 K on average, the diﬀerence with the
RM05+Cas10 Teﬀ scale is more variable, as the Teﬀ scale has a
diﬀerent morphology than the others. While the RM05+Cas10
Teﬀ scale (dashed line) is about 70 K hotter than the Victoria Teﬀ
scale at the TOP (Teﬀ(cid:62) 6300), it is on average about 70 K cooler
on the base-RGB (bRGB) before converging to the Victoria
scale on the RGB. On average, however, the RM05+Cas10 scale
is 17 K cooler than the Victoria scale.

Additionally, a spectroscopic Teﬀ scale was also derived by
ﬁtting the wings of Hα using a grid of 1D LTE plane-parallel
and spherical MARCS model atmospheres (Gustafsson et al.
2008) together with the spectral synthesis code Spectroscopy
Made Easy (SME, Valenti & Piskunov 1996; Valenti & Fischer
2005). The automated ﬁtting method uses metal-line free re-
gions extending up to ±50 Å from the centre of the Hα line (see
Lind et al. 2008) while avoiding the line core. We note that this
method is not applicable to the coolest stars in the sample be-
cause temperature sensitivity of the wings of the Balmer lines
becomes too weak. For those stars we used lines from iron-
peak elements (see Table 2) to obtain the Teﬀ from the excita-
tion balance. As the spectra of the hottest stars are the result
of a coaddition of up to 20 exposures that were stacked with
an outlier-resistant technique, they do not show strong con-
tamination of tellurics. If weak tellurics are present, they do
not strongly inﬂuence the best-ﬁt temperature since they are
evenly distributed over the Hα proﬁle and neighbouring con-
tinuum regions. Consequently, the uncertainty is set by the
signal-to-noise ratio in the line.

A comparison between the photometric Teﬀ scales and
the spectroscopic one is given in Fig. 3.
The plot shows
the diﬀerence between the derived Hα temperatures and the
eﬀective temperatures obtained from the diﬀerent photometric
calibrations and the isochrone temperatures.From the compari-
son we see that the Victoria Teﬀ scale agrees best with the Hα
temperatures. This is especially true on the bRGB (5000 K(cid:54)
Teﬀ(cid:54) 5500 K), where the Victoria scale is on average 30 ± 80 K
hotter than the Al96+99 and RM05+Cas10 scales, which are
97 ± 73 K cooler and 49 ± 77 K cooler, respectively, than the Hα
temperatures. On the TOP (Teﬀ(cid:62) 6300) the Victoria scale also
matches the Hα temperatures best with an average diﬀerence
of 17 ± 78 K compared to 172 ± 76 K and −48 ± 83 K for the
Al96+99 and RM05+Cas10 scales, respectively. On the SGB

Meléndez (2005), to colour indices V − I. The y-axis shows ∆Teﬀ =

peratures below 4950 K, the excitation temperatures are shown. The

the temperatures seem less well constrained, as is apparent from
the large spread in Hα temperatures (see Fig. 2). This is largely
due to the decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio with increasing
V magnitude, but also shows how diﬃcult it is to achieve high
precision on the temperatures of SGB stars using a photometric
calibration.

Given the high uncertainty on Teﬀ based on Hα compared to
photometric Teﬀ and the large diﬀerence between the Al96+99
and RM05+Cas10 Teﬀ scale, we here opt to use temperatures
based on the isochrone as our primary Teﬀ scale because it is the
most homogeneous. We note that we achieve the better agree-
ment with the Victoria scale partly by construction, as we varied
age, distance modulus and reddening to obtain the best ﬁt with
the observations. Circular arguments with respect to atomic dif-
fusion are not an issue. The complete set of eﬀective tempera-
tures is given in Table 1.

3.2. Surface gravities

As we use temperatures based on the isochrone, we com-
plemented these temperatures with the corresponding gravities
to complete our stellar parameter set homogeneously. Using
the 13.4 Gyr isochrone, we ﬁnd surface gravities ranging from
log g = 4.21 on the TOP at 6400 K to log g = 0.82 at the tip of
the RGB at 4200 K.

To estimate the uncertainty on the gravities, we investigated
the diﬀerence between the adopted isochrone gravities and pho-
tometric gravities. Photometric surface gravities are commonly
derived by using the customary relation between the eﬀective
temperature, the luminosity, the mass, and the surface gravity.
The luminosities were calculated using the bolometric correc-

tion that is a function of metallicity [Fe/H] and Teﬀ and were
obtained by using the Alonso et al. (1999) calibration. Given
the two photometric Teﬀ scales, we can calculate the diﬀerence
in gravity for each scale. We ﬁnd very similar gravities, with
average diﬀerences of −0.033 and +0.008 for the Al96+99 and
RM05+Cas10 scales, respectively.

The study presented here is based on the abundance diﬀer-
ence between stars. As such, the importance lies in the accu-
racy in surface gravities on a relative scale rather than on the
absolute scale. The dominant source of errors then stems from
the uncertainty in Teﬀ, for example an error in Teﬀ of +100 K
translates into an increase of approximately 0.03 dex in loga-
rithmic surface gravity. This is why we ﬁnd a larger diﬀerence
between the Victoria gravities and the gravities derived by us-
ing the RM05+Cas10 Teﬀ scale than for the Al96+99 Teﬀ scale.
Other contributions to the error on log g are minor compared
to the uncertainty stemming from Teﬀ. An uncertainty in stel-
lar mass of 0.03 M(cid:12) leads only to an uncertainty of 0.015 dex,
while an increase of 0.01 mag in V results in an error in log g
of about 0.004 dex. Finally, the uncertainty in distance modulus
will only aﬀect the absolute values of the surface gravity, for ex-
ample an increase of 0.5 in (m − M)V will raise the overall log g
with 0.2 dex.
The expected precision in log g thus predominantly follows the
uncertainty in Teﬀ , and given the colour-based uncertainty of
30 K in the giants and 85 K in the dwarfs, the surface gravity
is accurate within 0.02 dex for the giants and 0.03 dex for the
dwarfs. We note that the uncertainty on distance modulus is not
included and that, using the uncertainties based on Teﬀ(Hα),
we ﬁnd uncertainties in the gravity of 0.1 dex on the TOP
(Teﬀ > 5900 K with a Teﬀ uncertainty of 161 K) and 0.03 dex
on the RGB (Teﬀ < 5200 K with a Teﬀ uncertainty of 50 K).

3.3. Spectral synthesis

We determined spectroscopic temperatures (to compare to our
photometric Teﬀ values) and chemical abundances for individual
elements with an automated pipeline, based upon the SME spec-
trum synthesis program (Valenti & Piskunov 1996). The pipeline
consists of a suite of IDL routines, optimised to control the ana-
lysis of Gaia-ESO GIRAFFE data through an iterative scheme.
Brieﬂy, we performed a χ2 minimisation between the observed
spectra and synthetic spectra based upon a grid of 1D LTE plane-
parallel and spherical MARCS model atmospheres (Gustafsson
et al. 2008), applying masks to un-blended parts of carefully se-
lected spectral lines (see Table 2). The observed spectra ingested
in the pipeline are not pre-normalised.

The iteration scheme used in the pipeline is divided into two
main blocks. For the ﬁrst block, we adopted the starting guesses
for Teﬀ, and log g based on photometry, and kept [Fe/H] ﬁxed to
the metallicity of the cluster with an α-enhancement of 0.4 dex.

Notes. Only the lines measurable in the TOP stars were used to de-
termine the abundance, the other lines were only included to derive a
spectroscopic temperature for the RGB stars.

The second block adopted as starting guess the ﬁnal results of the
ﬁrst block. Each block was divided into two parts, normalisation
and stellar-parameter determination.

The normalisation was performed before each stellar param-
eter determination run by robust linear ﬁts to 5-60 Å segments,
minimising the χ2 distance between observations and a ﬁxed-
parameter synthesis. Thereafter, the χ2 minimisation was de-
signed to optimise the Teﬀ. These derived Teﬀ values were then
used as our spectroscopic Teﬀ scale.

The micro- and macro-turbulence values were determined
iteratively, using the starting parameter values for each block,
from the relations used in the Gaia-ESO survey. The projected
rotational velocity was set to 1.0 km s−1.

The main physical diagnostics that governs the stellar
parameter optimisation were the Hα line for Teﬀ and, if possible,
the excitation balance of Fe I lines. In each iteration the log g
was updated by using the customary relation between the
eﬀective temperature, the luminosity, the mass, and the surface
gravity.

In a second iteration block, we solved for individual chem-
ical abundances by using as input stellar parameters the diﬀer-
ent sets, spectroscopic, photometric, and isochrone-based stel-
lar parameters. To this aim, masks covering unblended spectral
features for Li, Ca, and Fe, (Li, Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni, and Ba) were
automatically computed for each star (RGB star) and adopted to
determine the abundance if the number of pixels in the mask ex-
ceeded ﬁve. Additionally, the code was modiﬁed to allow NLTE
line formation for Li, Fe, and Ca from a grid of precomputed cor-
rections (tabulations of LTE departure coeﬃcients). The NLTE
corrections for Li and Fe are based on pre-computed departure
coeﬃcients by Lind et al. (2009b) and Lind et al. (2012) for Li
and Fe, respectively. The Ca NLTE corrections are based upon
the Ca NLTE model atom described in footnote 3 on page 7 of
Melendez et al. (in prep.).

The errors provided by SME are computed from the error
vectors constructed from the variance of the observations. These
form part of the deﬁnition of the χ2 in SME and are thus used to
optimise parameters, derive abundances, and determine their as-
sociated internal errors. The given uncertainties in stellar param-
eters have not been propagated and added into these abundance
uncertainties.

4. Results
4.1. Ca and Fe
Iron and calcium abundances were derived for a sample of 144
stars. As the stars were only observed in one GIRAFFE setting
(HR15N), the line selection is very limited. For Ca, the spectrum
shows one ‘strong’ (EW=15-20 mÅ in TOP spectrum) Ca line
at 6493.9 Å and two weak to very-weak lines (EW=5-10 mÅ
in TOP spectrum) at 6499.7 and 6717.7 Å. For Fe, we ﬁnd one
strong line at 6495.0 Å and ﬁve very weak lines, including one
Fe II line at 6516.1 Å.

The derived NLTE abundances for iron and calcium are dis-
played in Fig. 4. The measurements become more uncertain with
increasing Teﬀ as the lines become weaker and the signal-to-
noise ratio drops. This is shown in the ﬁgure by the increasing
standard deviation (dashed lines) around a running mean (solid
line). The running mean shows the weighted average abundance
in bins of ±150 K, smoothed by a Gaussian (σ = 100 K). To
increase our chances of detecting Fe and Ca abundances near
the hot end of the sample, we coadded stars with similar stellar
parameters, weighting each spectrum with respect to its signal-
to-noise ratio, as we did in previous papers in the series. The
abundances derived from these coadded group spectra are over-
plotted in Fig. 4 with their respective error bars that represent the
statistical error. We omit the error bars for the individual stars for
reasons of clarity.
Fe shows a trend with eﬀective temperature, while Ca seems
more or less ﬂat. We note that the coadded group-spectra dis-
play the same abundance pattern as the running mean of the
individual stars. Similar (slightly stronger) trends are obtained
with the other Teﬀ-scales discussed in the paper. The diﬀerent
trends are given in Table 3, while Table 4 summarises the aver-
age abundances derived for Fe and Ca at three representative ef-
fective temperature points corresponding to the RGB, SGB, and
TOP. The values in Table 3 are derived by taking the diﬀerence
between the mean values and their corresponding standard de-
viations on the TOP (Teﬀ> 6200 K) and the middle of the RGB
(5100 K < Teﬀ< 4900 K). In Table 4 the values are derived by
taking the median values within each evolutionary group. The
uncertainties on the abundance are given by the corresponding

standard deviation within each group. The results for the individ-
ual coadded groups can be found in Table A.1 in the appendix.

4.2. Li

In addition to Ca and Fe abundances, we also derived lithium
abundances by using the 7Li resonance line at 6707Å. The line
has two ﬁne-structure components, separated by merely 0.15 Å
and hence unresolved at the GIRAFFE resolution of R = 19 300.
To measure the line accurately, we used atomic-line data from
the Vienna Atomic Line Database (VALD, Piskunov et al. 1995;
Kupka et al. 1999). We adopted log g f = −0.036 and −0.337
for the diﬀerent components.
Li abundances where derived under the assumption of LTE
and corrected for NLTE eﬀects in 1D according to Lind et al.
(2009a). The corrections on Li at this metallicity are rather
small with typical values of −0.05 dex for TOP and SGB stars,
but they increase and change sign with decreasing Teﬀ and
log g. The largest corrections (+0.13 - +0.15 dex) are found
for the coolest RGB stars. The derived NLTE abundances can
be found in Table 5 along with the adopted stellar parameters
and the abundances for Ca and Fe. Figure 7 shows the derived
NLTE Li abundances as a function of absolute visual magnitude
MV along with the CMD of M30. The ﬁgure agrees with
expectations: we ﬁnd two very well deﬁned plateaus, one for
dwarfs (A(Li) ≈ 2.2) and one for giants (A(Li) ≈ 1.1). At the
end of the dwarf plateau in the middle of the SGB (MV ≈ 3.25),
the Li abundances drastically drop to the giant plateau as a
result of the ﬁrst dredge-up, the dilution of the stellar surface
convection layer with hydrogen-processed and lithium-depleted
material from deeper layers. The giant plateau ends at the RGB
bump (MV ≈ 0) with another steep drop in Li abundance. This
last drop can probably be explained by thermohaline mixing
(Charbonnel & Zahn 2007), a mixing process that becomes
eﬃcient when the hydrogen-burning shell crosses the chemical
discontinuity left behind by the ﬁrst dredge-up. This mixing

process rapidly transports the surface Li down to the hotter
inner layer where the fragile element is readily destroyed. The
result is a Li-depleted surface layer. Similar lithium trends are
observed in other metal-poor clusters such as NGC 6397 (Lind
et al. 2009b; Nordlander et al. 2012), NGC 6752 (Gruyters et al.
2013, 2014), and M4 (Mucciarelli et al. 2012, Gruyters et al.,
submitted), (Gruyters et al. in prep.) as well as in halo ﬁeld stars
(Gratton et al. 2000).

5. Discussion
5.1. Comparison to atomic diffusion models
Figure 5 shows average abundances and the abundances from the
coadded group-averages of Ca and Fe as a function of eﬀective
temperature.
In both panels the observed abundance trends
are compared with predictions from stellar-structure models
including atomic diﬀusion and additional mixing (AddMix)
with diﬀerent eﬃciencies. While atomic diﬀusion is modelled
from ﬁrst principles, AddMix is a mixing mechanism modelled
as a diﬀusive process using a parametric function of density.
The eﬃciency of AddMix is given by a reference temperature
T0 (Richard et al. 2005, and references therein). The absolute
abundance scale of the models is slightly shifted to agree with
the observations from the coadded group-averages for stars
evolved beyond the onset of the ﬁrst dredge-up. The dashed line
gives the predicted initial abundance after correcting for atomic
diﬀusion and AddMix.
Figure 6 gives the evolution of Li as a function of eﬀective
temperature for the individual stars.
In the plot, the arrows
represent upper limits to the Li abundance, while the solid
lines are the predictions from stellar-structure models including
atomic diﬀusion and additional mixing (AddMix) with diﬀerent
eﬃciencies. For Li the eﬃciency of AddMix determines the
amount of Li that is transported from the surface convection
zone to the stellar interior. The eﬃciency thus aﬀects the over-
all appearance of the Li abundance plateau. Where the T6.09

plateau, the T5.80 model clearly predicts the surface abundances
to be dependent on eﬀective temperature. Unfortunately, none
of the models perfectly reproduces the derived Li abundances

together with the observed abundances of Ca and Fe. The low
Fe and high Ca abundances observed in the hottest coadded
group-average, however, seem to point towards a model with a
lower eﬃciency (T5.80), lower than that needed to explain the
trends in NGC 6397 at a metallicity of [Fe/H]= −2.1. We do,
however, advise caution about this result. As the size of the
abundance trends predicted by the models is set by the relative
abundance diﬀerence between the hottest and the coolest stars,
it is crucial to derive precise abundances in these points. Given
the limited signal-to-noise ratio and the weakness of the lines
on the hot end of the sample, it is extremely diﬃcult to reach
a precision better than 0.1 dex, which is needed to constrain
the eﬃciency of AddMix. To obtain our warmest coadded
group-average abundances, we coadded 28 spectra to reach a
signal-to-noise ratio of about 60. This is just barely enough
to derive Ca and Fe abundances with a measurement error of
0.1 dex, which does not include propagated uncertainties based
on stellar parameters. The true uncertainty on abundances thus
does not allow us to strictly limit the eﬃciency of AddMix.

The initial Li abundance of M30 was obtained by matching
the models to the observed Li abundances (see Fig. 6). As the
observations do not allow us to place ﬁrm constrains on the
eﬃciency of AddMix, we chose the T6.00 model to derive a
conservative lower estimate of the initial Li abundance. We
chose the T6.00 since this eﬃciency was derived for the GC
NGC 6397, which has a metallicity ([Fe/H] = −2.1) close to that
of M30, and we do not observe a bump in the Li abundances
around 5800 K that is predicted by the models with lower eﬃ-

ciency. After correcting for atomic diﬀusion and AddMix with
an eﬃciency of T6.00, we ﬁnd a value of A(Li) = 2.48 ± 0.10.
However, based on the observed abundances for Ca and Fe, it
might also be argued that the eﬃciency needs to be low. For
the T5.80 model the initial Li abundance would then increase
to A(Li) = 2.68 ± 0.10 (the models would be shifted vertically
to obtain the best ﬁt for the TOP stars), although the models
would then fail to predict the observed abundances on the RGB
plateau as is the case for NGC 6397. Whether this discrepancy
is due to a lack in our understanding of the ﬁrst dredge-up at
the metal-poor end or a problem with the derived abundances
is diﬃcult to say. More research on both fronts, theory and
observations, will have to be conducted to understand the
underlying physics.

The lower estimate to the initial Li abundance based on the
T6.00 model does not fully agree with the latest predictions from
BBNS by Cyburt et al. (2015) of 2.66 ± 0.06, but is signiﬁ-
cantly closer than the uncorrected Li abundances. The value
agrees well with the Li abundances derived for other metal-
poor globular clusters such as NGC 6397 (A(Li) = 2.46 ± 0.09
at [Fe/H] = −2.10, Lind et al. 2009b), NGC 6752 (A(Li) =
2.53 ± 0.10 at [Fe/H] = −1.60, Gruyters et al. 2014), and M4
(A(Li) = 2.57 ± 0.10 at [Fe/H] = −1.10, Gruyters et al., submit-
ted) (Gruyters et al. in prep.). We note that these Li values are
derived from predictions by the stellar structure model including
AD and AddMix, which represents the observations best, and
thus from models with diﬀerent eﬃciencies of AddMix. The
observations seem to suggest that the eﬃciency of AddMix in-

creases with increasing metallicity. To date, no physical theory
has been presented that can explain this relation. Nevertheless,
this ﬁnding presents theorists with valuable constraints on the
physical origin of AddMix.

5.2. Li as tracer for multiple populations?

Figure 7 reveals a large spread in derived lithium abundances in
the individual evolutionary phases (TOP and RGB). Whether or
not the spread is intrinsic is hard to prove given the low data
quality on the TOP on the one hand and the weakness of the Li
feature on the RGB on the other. We seem to observe four stars
pre-ﬁrst dredge-up (M > 3.25) and two stars post-ﬁrst dredge-up
(3 > M > 1) that are clearly Li deﬁcient compared to the other
stars within these groups. Typical line proﬁles of the Li 6707Å
doublet in stellar spectra of diﬀerent stellar evolution phases are
shown in Fig. 8. The top two panels show the Li line proﬁles for
two stars with very diﬀerent Li abundances but similar stellar
parameters. The spread in Li seems to suggest that the cluster
hosts more than one stellar population, as is common in globular
clusters. Lind et al. (2009b) showed the existence of a Li-Na
anticorrelation in the metal-poor globular cluster NGC 6397.
The anticorrelation is a direct result of the past intra-cluster
pollution occurring during the early stages of the globular
cluster formation. Unfortunately, we do not have access to
other abundances to conﬁrm such a Li-Na anticorrelation or
any other anticorrelation that may reveal information about a
possible pollution epoch in this cluster. Evidence for multiple
populations in M30 has been presented by Monelli et al. (2013)
and Piotto et al. (2015) using photometry by noting multiple
main sequences and a split up of the RGB in the CMD of M30.
Earlier, Carretta et al. (2009) showed the presence of an Na-O
anticorrelation in M30.

These ﬁndings together with our observed spread in Li on
both the dwarf and giant plateau strengthens our view that part
of the stars in M30 were formed from Li-depleted gas as a re-
sult of pollution that occurred early on in the formation of M30.
This is fully consistent with the fact that the ejecta of the GC pol-
luters that are responsible for the O-Na anticorrelation have been
processed at very high temperature and are thus Li free. There-
fore, second-generation stars that formed out of Li-depleted ma-
terial mixed with pristine gas were born with an initial Li abun-
dance lower than the BBN value. We thus conclude that the
most Li-deﬁcient stars belong to a second generation, formed
from intra-cluster gas polluted by a ﬁrst generation of more mas-
sive, faster evolving stars. Our results can be used to evaluate
the amount of dilution between pristine material and polluter
ejecta (Lind et al. 2011 and Chantereau et al. 2015 and refer-
ences therein). We considered only TOP stars (Teﬀ > 5900 K)
with Li abundance higher than A(Li) = 2.0 to identify the most
likely ﬁrst-generation stars. Hence we disregarded seven stars of
the pre-ﬁrst dredge-up. The dispersion in this group is rather low,
σ(Li) = 0.12, and does not follow any obvious trend with eﬀec-
tive temperature or visual magnitude. The average measurement
error in abundance stemming from photon noise is 0.10 dex for
the hottest stars. To this we need to add the propagated uncer-
tainty in stellar parameters. When we include a typical error in
eﬀective temperature (50-100 K), which is the most inﬂuential
stellar parameter, we can explain a spread in Li abundances of
0.10-0.12 dex, and thus we conclude that the observed Li abun-
dances on the TOP and RGB plateau are compatible with zero
scatter among the ﬁrst-generation stars.
The average Li abundances on the TOP plateau is 2.21± 0.12. If
we repeat this for the RGB plateau by considering all stars with
5000 < Teﬀ < 5250 K and A(Li) > 1.0, we ﬁnd 1.10 ± 0.06.

enhancement we derive for the star is 0.27 dex lower than de-
rived by Kirby et al. (2016) but can fully be explained by the
diﬀerence in stellar parameters (see Table 6) and the low signal-
to-noise ratio of our spectrum, which does not allow us to derive
accurate abundances besides Li. The detection of Li-rich stars in
M30 adds to the ever-growing list of globular clusters that host
Li-rich stars. Monaco et al. (2012) reported the detection of a
Li-rich dwarf in M4 with a Li abundance compatible with the
predicted primordial lithium abundance based on standard BBN
(Coc et al. 2013). In addition to M4, there are at least three other
globular clusters that seem to harbour stars with Li abundances
similar to the primordial Li abundance, NGC 6752 (Shen et al.
2010) and 47 Tuc (D’Orazi et al. 2010), or well above the pri-
mordial Li abundance, NGC 6397 (Koch et al. 2011).
Li-rich giants have mostly been detected in the ﬁeld (Casey et al.
in prep.)
(see e.g. Charbonnel & Balachandran 2000; Ruchti
et al. 2011; Kumar & Reddy 2009; Kumar et al. 2011; Lebzel-
ter et al. 2012, and Casey et al. 2016, submitted ), and a new
study reported that about 0.56% of the red giants are Li-rich
(Zhang et al. 2015). To date, ten Li-rich giants are known in
seven globular clusters. These clusters are M3 (Kraft et al.
1999), M5 (Carney et al. 1998), M30 (Kirby et al. 2016), M68
(Ruchti et al. 2011; Kirby et al. 2016), NGC 362 (Smith et al.
1999; D’Orazi et al. 2015), NGC 5053 (Kirby et al. 2016), and
NGC 5897 (Kirby et al. 2016). While until recently, only one
giant had been found to reside close to the RGB bump (D’Orazi
et al. 2015), Kirby et al. (2016) now added four more Li-rich
stars that have not yet evolved beyond the second dredge-up. Our
Li-rich star in M30 is the least evolved star (V = 17.7) to date
and forms an important data point in bridging the Li evolution
from Li-rich dwarfs to Li-rich giants. Unfortunately, the spec-
tral coverage does not allow us to precisely determine any other
abundances, but there is no indication for Ba enhancement, and
we thus conclude that the star is not enhanced in the s-process.
The lack of s-process enrichment then demonstrates that the Li
enrichment comes from mass transfer of an AGB star before the
thermal pulses set in and can pollute the stellar winds with s-
process material. Furthermore, as the star has not reached the
RGB and the Li abundance and after correcting for atomic dif-
fusion (A(Li)init = 2.76) is comparable to the Li-rich dwarfs de-
tected in other globular clusters, it is reasonable to assume that
this star is more closely related to the Li-rich dwarfs than to the
Li-rich giants. Clearly, it cannot have produced the large amount
of lithium itself. In fact, comparing the Li abundances of all less
evolved giants (MV > −1), we might argue that they are the evo-
lutionary successors of the Li-rich dwarfs because none of them
could have produced the large amount of lithium themselves. For
a more elaborate discussion on why the mass-transfer scenario
is a viable explanation for these stars, see Kirby et al. (2016).
Other scenarios for the Li production in giant stars can be found
in Casey et al. (in prep.).

6. Summary
We have performed a chemical abundance analysis based on GI-
RAFFE HR15N data of 144 stars in the globular cluster M30
at a metallicity of −2.3. We presented NLTE abundances for
Ca, Fe, and Li for stars in diﬀerent evolutionary phases from
the TOP to the tip of the RGB. This is the ﬁrst time that chem-
ical abundances for the faint TOP in this cluster were derived.
We observed an abundance trend in iron with respect to eﬀec-
tive temperature. This trend and the results for Li and Ca can be
explained as a result of atomic diﬀusion reduced by a compet-

Fig. 8.
Example ﬁts of the Li I 6707Å line. Each panel shows the
stellar id and stellar parameters. From top to bottom we have a Li-
normal TOP star, a Li-poor TOP star, a Li-normal SGB star just before
Li dilution as a result of the ﬁrst dredge-up sets in, the Li-rich bRGB
star, and a Li-normal RGB star.

5.3. A Li-rich subgiant

Among our Li abundances we found one SGB star (id-1966)
that is heavily enriched in lithium. With a Li abundance of
2.39 ± 0.07 dex it resides well above the average Li abundance
for giants and dwarfs in M30. Although we only have one
observation, we did not detect any anomalies in the stellar radial
velocity, and its radial velocity vrad = −186.3 ± 5.0 km s−1is
consistent with that of the cluster, vrad = −183.6± 0.6 km s−1. As
we do not detect any abnormalities with the stellar photometry
or stellar parameters, we conﬁrm cluster membership of the
Li-rich subgiant to M30. The stellar line proﬁle of the Li 6707Å
doublet is shown in the fourth panel from the top in Fig. 8 and
leaves little doubt that the star is indeed lithium rich. It is the
strongest proﬁle observed in our sample.

Two Li-rich stars were discovered in M30 by Kirby et al.
(2016). The Li-rich star in our sample corresponds to the star

Notes. The ids for the Kirby et al. (2016) stars refer to the Sandquist et al. (1999) catalogue. Crossmatching our catalogue with the Sandquist et al.
(1999) catalogue identiﬁed stars M30-132 and 1966 as the same. (a) As a result of the limiting signal-to-noise ratio of the stellar spectrum only an
upper estimate for the Fe abundance could be derived. (b) Kirby et al. (2016)

ing transport or mixing process referred to as additional mixing.
This is the fourth cluster after NGC 6397, NGC 6752, and M4
that shows atomic diﬀusion signatures. Given the low signal-
to-noise ratio on the faint end of the sample, we were unable
to distinguish between atomic diﬀusion models with diﬀerent
additional mixing eﬃciencies, although the data seem to indi-
cate a similar or lower eﬃciency than for the globular cluster
NGC 6397 at a metallicity of −2.1. An attempt will be made to
collect more data in the upcoming observing period to establish
the additional mixing eﬃciency needed to explain the diﬀusion
trends observed in this cluster.
We detected one Li-rich subgiant in our sample. With this detec-
tion we show that Li-rich stars can be found in all evolutionary
phases in globular clusters and thus that Li enhancement prob-
ably is not created during the RGB bump phase.
Instead, the
enhancement in Li could be the result of Li-rich mass transfer
during the life cycle of the star. Alternatively, the star could have
been formed from locally polluted Li-rich gas. The Li abun-
dances for the other stars show the typical Li evolution detected
in globular clusters in which the TOP and SGB stars form a thin
Li plateau on the same level as the Spite plateau for ﬁeld stars.
Further on in the evolution, the Li abundance drops dramatically
as a result of mixing processes connected with low-mass stellar
evolution.
The spread in Li abundance on the plateau seems to indicate the
presence of diﬀerent stellar populations, but to conclude on this,
other light element abundances need to be derived for the stars.
Unfortunately, given the spectral information at hand, this was
not possible. The Li plateau value we derived for the dwarfs,
after correcting it for atomic diﬀusion and a conservative eﬃ-
ciency of additional mixing (T6.0 model), is 2.48 ± 0.10 and
falls slightly below the agreement window for the primordial Li
abundance as derived from the baryonic density deduced from
the ﬂuctuations of the cosmic microwave background and stan-
dard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The value is the lowest in the
series of papers about atomic diﬀusion in globular clusters, but
is still consistent with the diﬀusion-corrected Li abundances in
the other clusters. The lower value could be a result of the diﬀer-
ent temperature scale used in this work. Steps have been taken
to obtain new Strömgren photometry for the cluster, and a new
dataset should be obtained in September 2016. After it is prop-
erly calibrated, a new temperature scale can be derived that is
closely related to the temperature scales used to derive the abun-
dances in the other clusters.
