Luttinger liquids (LLs) arise by coupling left- and right-moving particles through interactions
in one dimension. This most natural partitioning of LLs is investigated by the momentum-space
entanglement after a quantum quench using analytical and numerical methods. We show that
the momentum-space entanglement spectrum of a LL possesses many universal features both in
equilibrium and after a quantum quench. The largest entanglement eigenvalue is identical to the
Loschmidt echo, i.e. the overlap of the disentangled and ﬁnal wavefunctions of the system. The
second largest eigenvalue is the overlap of the ﬁrst excited state of the disentangled system with zero
total momentum and the ﬁnal wavefunction. The entanglement gap is universal both in equilibrium
and after a quantum quench. The momentum-space entanglement entropy is always extensive
and saturates fast to a time independent value after the quench, in sharp contrast to a spatial
bipartitioning.

Introduction.

There is nothing more quantum me-
chanical than entanglement, when the state of certain
particles cannot be described independently from the
rest. This constitutes one of the most fundamental dif-
ferences between classical and quantum physics. While
entanglement has always been considered as an interest-
ing quantity from its early existence, its governing role in
various ﬁelds of physics, especially those ﬁelds dominated
by strong correlations, has only become clear recently
[1]. For example, entanglement plays an important role
in understanding the thermodynamics of black holes [2],
quantum information theory [3] and (topological) order
[4].

The entanglement characteristics of a system is ob-
tained usually by partitioning it into two distinct regions,
and investigating the properties of the reduced density
matrix (eigenvalues, entropies etc.) of one of the regions.
While this partitioning is mostly spatial, i.e. done in
real-space, other ways of partitioning are equally fruit-
ful.
In particular, partitioning in momentum-space is
natural as various instabilities and phase transitions oc-
cur by coupling distinct regions in momentum-space to-
gether via interactions. For example, Cooper pairs are
made of particles with opposite momentum and give rise
to superconductivity. Density waves are created from
electron-hole pairs with a ﬁnite wavevector diﬀerence.
In one dimension, Luttinger liquids (LLs), which host
many interesting phenomena such as spin-charge sep-
aration, charge fractionalization, and non-Fermi liquid
behaviour, appear after coupling right- and left-moving
fermions together [5, 6]. Therefore, a momentum-space
partition oﬀers a unique perspective on the structure of
many-particle wavefunctions [7–19].

Parallel to these developments, non-equilibrium dy-
namics [20, 21] have enjoyed immense interest due to
experimental advances in cold atomic gases [22]. In this
context, the study of quantum quenches, i.e. time evolv-
ing a ground state wavefunction with a diﬀerent Hamilto-
nian, is particularly challenging due to the interplay of in-
teractions and non-equilibrium dynamics. Recently pro-
posals have been made about measuring entanglement in
cold atom systems, e.g., by using quantum switches cou-
pled to a composite system consisting of several copies
of the original many-body system [23] or using quantum
interference between the copies [24].

In this work, we combine momentum-space entangle-
ment and quantum quenches in a LL. We demonstrate
that after tracing out the left-movers, the entanglement
gap (EG), which is the diﬀerence between the two lowest
levels of the entanglement spectrum (ES) [25], is uni-
versal in a LL both in equilibrium and after a quantum
quench and depends only on the Luttinger parameter.
We show, by using bosonization and numerical exact di-
agonalization on an interacting lattice model, that the
largest eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix (the low-
est level of the ES) is identical to the Loschmidt echo,
i.e. the overlap of the ground state of the disentangled,
non-interacting system and the ﬁnal wavefunction of the
interacting system. The Loschmidt echo is related to
statistics of work done [26, 27] and the Crooks relation
[28], therefore our results create a direct link between
entanglement characteristics and recent developments in
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

ics of LLs is described in terms of bosonic sound-like
collective excitations, regardless to the statistics of the

where g(q) = g2|q|, with g2 the interaction strength, and
ωq = v|q| the energy of bosonic excitations with mo-
mentum q. Starting from the non-interacting limit with
g2 = 0, we focus on two extreme cases of turning on in-
teractions, adiabatically and suddenly. In the adiabatic
case (which we also refer to as the equilibrium case), the
system always remains in its ground state. In the case
of a sudden quantum quench, the interaction strength is
suddenly changed to some ﬁnite value. The ﬁnal velocity

we use the natural partitioning of the wavefunction in
terms of right (q > 0) and left (q < 0) moving excita-
tions and trace out all the left-movers. By expanding the
exponential in Taylor series in the wavefunction, the re-
duced density matrix, ρA(t), for the right-movers reads
as

It creates a direct link between entanglement, quantum
quenches [20, 21] and work statistics [26, 27] as the latter
is the Fourier transform of L(t). This connection and its
numerical veriﬁcation is one of our main results.

The largest eigenvalue of ρA is not the only entangle-

fact, all entanglement levels can be linked to the over-

In equilibrium, all Bo-

single particle entanglement eigenvalues, pn(q), are equal

This EG occurs for modes with sin2(vf|q|t) = 1. In the
thermodynamic limit (TDL), for every time t, there is
always a momentum state which satisﬁes this condition.

(blue line) after a quantum quench for the representative case
of Jz = J/2 and N = 26 is plotted, together with the over-
lap of the Jz = 0 and the quenched Jz = J/2 wavefunction
(red circles), falling on top of each other (up to numerical
accuracy). The upturn around tJ = 9 is due to ﬁnite size
eﬀects, following from the comparison of the inﬁnite system
result [31] (black dashed line). The green star denotes the
prediction of Eq. (10), which is valid for times much larger
than the transient time. The inset visualizes adiabatic results
for Pmax (blue squares) and the overlap of the ground state
wavefunctions (red dots) for N = 14 (upper dataset) and 22
(lower dataset). The ED data approaches Eq. (8) (black line),
which is valid in the TDL, upon increasing the system size.

Exact diagonalization. We now test these analytical
predictions numerically using exact diagonalization (ED)
on a half-ﬁlled tight binding chain of one-dimensional in-
teracting spinless fermions with nearest-neighbour inter-
actions and periodic boundary conditions [5, 6]. This sys-
tem can be mapped to the XXZ Heisenberg model by a
Jordan-Wigner transformation, whose nomenclature we
use [5].

a momentum-space Jordan-Wigner transformation, we
arrive at a momentum-space Hamiltonian of hard-core
bosons, which is solved numerically using ED or the
Lanczos method. We consider system sizes of N = 10,
14, 18, 22 and 26 (to avoid a degenerate Fermi sea) and
then perform ﬁnite size scaling to reach the TDL. For the
range of parameters we consider, there is a unique non-
degenerate ground state. We compute the time evolution
of the momentum-space wavefunction using the Krylov
method until tJ = 20 [34]. After constructing the density
matrix from the wavefunction in momentum-space basis,
all left-movers (i.e. k < 0 modes) are traced out, giving
the reduced density matrix.

Eqs.

(4) and (5) predict that the largest eigenvalue
of ρA is equal to the overlap of the decoupled and cou-
pled wavefunction. Using ED, Pmax, as well as the over-
lap of the Jz = 0 ground state wavefunction with the
ﬁnite Jz adiabatic or sudden quench wavefunction, are
evaluated and shown in Fig. 1. These agree perfectly
both in equilibrium and after the quench (within numer-
ical accuracy), thus conﬁrming the bosonization predic-

estimated from the ﬁdelity susceptibility χf [31], which
gives L/2πα ≈ N χf π2 with χf ≈ 0.0195 [35]. Eq. (5)
also works at the Jz = −J point (not shown), which
falls outside of the validity of bosonization because the
excitation spectrum changes from linear to quadratic in
momentum. We conjecture that Eq. (5) is valid for other
systems as well.

From the analysis of the the numerical data (not
shown), we ﬁnd that for all system sizes considered
and within the critical region, the second largest eigen-
value of ρA equals the overlap between the ﬁnal, cou-

pled wavefunction and the ﬁrst excited state of the dis-
entangled wavefunction with total momentum 0, arising
from annihilating a left and a right mover from right
below the ﬁlled Fermi sea and creating a left and right
mover right above the Fermi sea, shown in Fig. 2, i.e.

the case of a quantum quench, P1 (during its time evo-
lution) is equal to the overlap between the time evolved
wavefunction and a general total momentum zero excited
state of the initial disentangled Hamiltonian, but not nec-
essarily the ﬁrst zero momentum excited state. However,
the minimal value of P1 over time, which deﬁnes the EG,
occurs for the ﬁrst zero momentum excited state.

The EG, which is the minimal diﬀerence between the
ground state and ﬁrst excited state of the ES, is shown
in Fig. 3. After a quantum quench, the EG is obtained
from the diﬀerence of the ﬁrst two eigenvalues of ρA af-
ter the transient time but before the revival time N/J,
when ﬁnite size eﬀects become important. The EG is
largely insensitive to variations within this window. The
same results are obtained when the EG is calculated from
the overlaps of the ﬁnal wavefunction with the states
shown in Fig. 2. Around the non-interacting XX point,
∆EG ∼ − ln(J 2
z ) since the left and right moving fermions
are perfectly disentangled in this case. Both in equilib-
rium and after the quantum quench, the EG is universal
and in near perfect agreement with bosonization predic-
tion throughout the critical region, depending only on
K. The EG stays ﬁnite for Jz > 0 within the LL phase,
and does not vanish even at the BKT transition point at
Jz = J. On the other hand, the EG collapses at Jz = −J,
signaling the ﬁrst order quantum critical point. In equi-
librium, ∆EG ∼ √Jz + J for Jz & −J, which changes
to ∆EG ∼ Jz + J after a quantum quench. We suspect
that the EG is sensitive to any ﬁnite order quantum crit-
ical point, except possibly for the BKT transition, being
of inﬁnite order. The detection of the BKT transition
is also diﬃcult using the ﬁdelity susceptibility [35]. One
possible scenario is that the EG does not detect the BKT
transition due to the non-universality of the ES [36]. In
fact, recent numerical work on the momentum-space ES
of the XXZ spin-half chain strongly suggests that EG
(in equilibrium) remains open in the gapped phase [11].
We leave the non-universality of the ES after a quantum
quench an open question.

is quantiﬁed by the (von-Neumann or R´enyi) entangle-
ment entropy. The momentum-space von-Neumann en-

and after a quench for a LL, respectively [1]. For the
present case, interactions connects q and −q states, and
by halving momentum-space for partitioning, the num-
ber of bonds we cut through is proportional to the num-
ber of momentum states, i.e. ∼ N . Thus, a volume
law holds for the entropy both in equilibrium and af-
(13), S grows as
ter the quench. By inspecting Eq.
∼ Lt2 ln(1/t) initially after the quench, before saturating
(within a timescale α/v or 1/J) to a ﬁnite, ∼ L but t
independent value in the TDL. These results are repro-
duced by ED. Fig. (3) shows the ratio of the entropies (in
steady state) after a quantum quench and in equilibrium
from ED, free from the extensive N or L/α prefactor.
We see that Squench > Sequilibrium (after a short initial
transient time) and their biggest ratio is 2. This ratio is
reached as one approaches the non-interacting limit.

Discussion. We have demonstrated that the low lying
entanglement levels of LLs are identical to the overlap
of the ﬁnal wavefunction and the zero total momentum
eigenstates of the disentangled Hamiltonian. The EG
persists throughout the critical phase and is a universal
function of the Luttinger parameter both in equilibrium
and after a quantum quench. Our results create a unique
link between entanglement and the Loschmidt echo[27]
as well as the closely related work statistics[26]. We note
our approach also quantiﬁes the entanglement between
the up and down spins in the spin ﬁltered helical edge

state of a quantum spin-Hall insulator[37].

The momentum-space entanglement entropy is always
extensive, and grows initially as S ∼ Lt2 ln(1/t) after a
quantum quench, before saturating to a time indepen-
dent value. Understanding momentum-space entangle-
ment bears relevance for the development of momentum-
space numerical techniques built on optimally entangled
states [14, 38]. The similar magnitude of the entangle-
ment entropies in equilibrium and after quench as well as
the separation of entanglement scales, i.e. the EG, near
the critical point could help improve the density matrix
renormalization group algorithm [11, 14]. For example,
the EG seems to stay ﬁnite at the BKT transition point
even after the quench, facilitating numerics [11].
