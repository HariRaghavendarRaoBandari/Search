Abstract

Theoretically, the coordinate measurement of two identical parti-
cles at a point by two narrowly separated narrow detectors, is inter-
preted in the limit of shrinking width and separation, as the detection
of two particles by a single narrow detector. Ordinarily, the ratio be-
tween probabilities of point measurements is independent of the width
of the narrow detectors. We show here that not only this is not the
case, but that in some scenarios the results depend on the way the
dimensions shrink to zero. The ratio between the width and the sepa-
ration determines the detection result.
In particular, it is shown that
the bunching parameter of bosons is not a well-deﬁned physical prop-
erty. Moreover, it may suggests that there is a diﬃculty in quantum
measurement theory in the interpretation of coordinate measurement
of two particles.

Introduction

The measurement of the spatial coordinate of a particle is notoriously prob-
lematic in quantum theory. Thus, spatial coordinate measurement reduces
the wave function to one of the spatial eigenstates, which is assumed to be a
delta function; however, a delta function is not square integrable and cannot
be normalized, and therefore has no physical meaning. Nevertheless, this
problem is avoided by realizing that pure spatial coordinate measurement is
not physical either and, in fact, any detector must have ﬁnite dimensions.

1

Consequently, the delta functions can be approximated by narrow step func-
tions of ﬁnite width [1]. This choice of approximate eigenstates resolves the
problem of the deﬁnition of coordinate measurement of a single particle at a
point for any practical purposes. Nevertheless, spatial coordinate measure-
ments may lead to divergence in some measurable quantities. The issue of
spatial coordinate measurement of a single particle was discussed elsewhere
[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], and is not addressed here.

The device of approximate eigenstates of the spatial coordinate of two
identical particles at a point, however, does not solve the measurement prob-
lem. Speciﬁcally, evidence for the diﬃculty in deﬁning coordinate measure-
ment of two identical particles at a point can be traced to [8], where un-
expected bosons anti-bunching and fermions bunching emerge. It is shown
below that two diﬀerent bunching measurements, which, according to [9] are
expected to be equivalent, lead to diﬀerent results. It is therefore the purpose
of this paper to explore the signiﬁcance of this behavior. We show, among
others, that due to the fact that two equivalent measurements ratios yield
diﬀerent results, there is an anomaly in the measurement of the spatial co-
ordinate of two identical particles at a point. Moreover, it suggests that the
bunching parameter is not a well-deﬁned parameter.

2 Traditional approaches and Feynman’s deriva-

tion

In an attempt to demonstrate bosons bunching, Feynman has suggested two
approaches to local measurement of two particles [9]. In the ﬁrst approach,
the two particles are measured by two single-particle detectors, i.e., each one
of the detectors detect only a single particle, and since the two detectors are
extremely narrow and adjacent to one another, then double measurement
correspond to local measurement of the two particles. The second approach
was to take a ﬁnite width single two-particle detector. He has shown that in
both approaches, in the limit where the size of the detectors goes to zero, the
approaches are consistent, and both manifest with bosons bunching. Mathe-
matically, for the probability densities of bosons, fermions, and distinguish-
able particles, (p(bos), p(fer), and p(dis), respectively, see deﬁnitions in section
(4) below), Feynman results can be written

p(bos) = 2p(dis),

(1)

2

for both approaches. Traditionally, this result was interpreted as the bosons’
property to bunch. Similarly, the classical relation for fermions,

p(fer) = 0,

(2)

is interpreted as the exclusion of fermions (anti bunching).

Therefore, according to these examples, the two measurement approaches
yield the same result, and therefore no inconsistencies occur, and it seems
that at least in this sense, the local measurement is well-deﬁned. Feynman
has also generalized the bunching eﬀect to N particles (bosonic enhancement
factor). However, when the number of ﬁnal states is also larger than 2 the
problem’s complexity increases considerably (see for example, Refs.[11] [12]).
Moreover, when the initial states are not orthogonal Eq.(1) changes to p(bos) =
βp(dis), where 1 ≤ β < 2 (see Ref.[10]).

3

Indication of a problem

Recently it has been demonstrated that, while Feynman’s argument is correct
in most cases, in some speciﬁc ones it fails (for details see [8], [13]). For
example, when one of the wavefunctions of the particles has a zero, then the
two approaches lead to diﬀerent results. The ﬁrst, two detectors approach,
leads to the following result:

and

p(bos) = 0,

p(fer) = 2p(dis),

(3)

(4)

which can be interpreted as bosons anti-bunching and fermions bunching,
which contradicts Feynman’s result.

Moreover, when the second approach is chosen, i.e. a single two-particles

detector, the following result appears:

p(bos) = p(fer) = p(dis),

(5)

in which case no bunching occurs for either bosons or fermions.

3

Besides the question of bunching (which was discussed in detailed in [8]),
there is a disturbing problem of inconsistencies between the two approaching
methods. Since the two measuring approaches are equivalent (they both
measure the probability to detect two particles at the same local spot) one
would expect, that not only that bosons would always bunch, but that there
should be no diﬀerence in the outcome of both approaches. It seems that if
the local measurement is well deﬁned then they should yield the same result.
One may argue that the source of this discrepancy is the fact that there
is something fundamentally diﬀerent between the two approaches. They are
based on two diﬀerent experimental scenarios:
in one experiment there are
two detectors and in the next there is only one. Parenthetically, it should be
stressed that there is no reason to expect that the result would be diﬀerent,
after all, when the detectors width and the distance between them shrink to
zero, the two scenarios measure the same thing - the probability to detect
two particles at the same place.It is clear that in the case of single particle
detection the two processes are completely identical.

In this paper we show that the root of the discrepancy is even deeper. The
discrepancy still holds even between two similar detection scenarios, which
both are local and include two detectors. We focus on the two detectors
scenario. This detection scenario is characterized by two parameters: the
width of the detectors and the distance between them. In the limit of local
measurement both parameters (detectors width and distance) should shrink
to zero. In this paper we show, that in certain cases, the result of the local
measurement depends on the ratio between the two parameters. E very ratio
yields a diﬀerent result, despite the fact that in all cases they both go to
zero, i.e., it seems that the inconsistency is a fundamental problem in local
measurement of two particles.

4 Theoretical Background

In Quantum Mechanics there is a clear distinction between distinguishable
particles, bosons and fermions.

In the case of spatial coordinate measurement the wave function of two

distinguishable particles is reduced to the product [1],

ψ(dis)(x1, x2) = ψ1(x1)ψ2(x2) or ψ1(x2)ψ2(x1),

(6)

where the single particle wave functions (SPWF’s) are ψ1(x) and ψ2(x). The

4

validity of this reduction is independent of the SPWF’s orthogonality and of
the particles’ interaction. If it is known that only one of the two particles is
in state ψ1(x), but it is not known which one, the joint pdf is

p(dis)(x1, x2) =

1

2 (cid:0)|ψ1(x1)|2|ψ2(x2)|2 + |ψ2(x1)|2|ψ1(x2)|2(cid:1) ,

which can be written as

p(dis)(x1, x2) =

1
2

[p1(x1)p2(x2) + p1(x2)p2(x1)] ,

(7)

(8)

where the single particle probability density function (pdf) is pj(xi) = |ψj(xi)|2
for i, j = 1, 2.
If the two particles are indistinguishable, such as bosons in the same spin

states, the joint symmetric wave function is

ψ(bos)(x1, x2) =

1
√2

[ψ1(x1)ψ2(x2) + ψ1(x2)ψ2(x1)]

(9)

and the joint pdf is [1]

p(bos)(x1, x2) =

1
2

[p1(x1)p2(x2) + p1(x2)p2(x1) + 2Re{ψ1(x1)ψ∗

1(x2)ψ2(x1)ψ∗

=p(dis)(x1, x2) + p(inter)(x1, x2).

2(x2)}]
(10)

Similarly, for fermions we obtain the antisymmetric joint wave function

ψ(fer)(x1, x2) =

1
√2

[ψ1(x1)ψ2(x2) − ψ1(x2)ψ2(x1)]

(11)

and

p(fer)(x1, x2) =

[p1(x1)p2(x2) + p1(x2)p2(x1) − 2Re{ψ1(x1)ψ∗

1
2
=p(dis)(x1, x2) − p(inter)(x1, x2).

1(x2)ψ2(x1)ψ∗

2(x2)}]
(12)

It should be stressed that these equations are valid, provided the single
particle wave-functions ψ1(x) and ψ2(x) are orthogonal. For non-orthogonal
initial states the results could be dramatically diﬀerent (this case will be
discussed elsewhere), but are not relevant to the present work.

4.1 Measurement of the spatial coordinate of two iden-

tical particles at a point

If the single particle wave function ψ(x) is continuous in the real segment
S : xa < x < xb, then, as xa and xb converge to the point x0,
the mean
probability density of detecting the particle within this segment,

ZS |ψ(x)|2 dx

RS dx

becomes independent of the width of S (namely, independent of xb − xa),
provided it is suﬃciently narrow. This implies that for two segments, S1 and
S2 containing the point (ξ1, ξ2), if ψ(x1, x2) is the two-dimensional contin-
uous two-particle wave function (either fermions, bosons or distinguishable
particles), then

ZS1×S2 |ψ(x1, x2)|2 dx1dx2

ZS1

dx1ZS2

dx2

(14)

becomes independent of S1 and S2 as the endpoints of the segments converge
to (ξ1, ξ2).

Because the bunching parameter is the ratio between the probability to
measure two bosons and the probability to measure two distinguishable par-
ticles at the same point (ξ1, ξ2), this ratio is meaningful only if

(13)

(15)

ZS1×S2 |ψ(bos)(x1, x2)|2 dx1dx2
RS1×S2 |ψ(dis)(x1, x2)|2 dx1dx2

is independent of S1 and S2 as the endpoints of the segments converge to
(ξ1, ξ2). It is shown below that (14) and (15) are not always valid.

4.2 Feynman’s derivation of boson bunching and fermion

anti bunching

The probability to measure two bosons and two fermions are described by
the joint pdf of the coordinates of two identical particles. Feynman [9] pro-
posed the following argument, in analogy with the discrete case (see Ref.[9]).

6

ψj(x) − ψj(x0)

x − x0

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

≤ γ.

(17)

Consider the single particle wave functions near x0 such that

ψj(x) = ψj(x0) + O(|x − x0|) with ψj(x0) 6= 0f orj = 1, 2,

(16)

which means, as usual, that there exist δ > 0 and γ > 0 such that if
0 < |x − x0| < δ, then

It follows, in particular, that if 0 < |xj − x0| < δ for j = 1, 2, then

pj(xj) = |ψj(x0)|2 + O(|xj − x0|)
p(inter) = |ψ1(x0)|2|ψ2(x0)|2 + O(|x1 − x0| + |x2 − x0|).

An alternative approach to the problem of measuring the two particles was
suggested in [9] (see Fig.1). It consists in detecting them with two detectors
of width ∆ ≪ λ, placed at distance η ≪ λ apart, where the particular case
of two point detectors was considered, that is, ∆ ≪ η ≪ λ. For the case at
hand λ is the smallest length scale of the wave function. For a plane wave, λ
is the wave length. It has been shown in [8] that this approach in the scenario
given in the previous section can lead to bosons anti bunching and fermions
bunching. It turns out that the limits of the probabilities for ∆ → 0 and
η → 0 are not interchangeable.
Indeed, choosing the condition (16) for |x − x0| < ∆ ≪ 1, as in [9], we
obtain from (10) that for ﬁxed η > 0

= 2 + O(∆3)

(18)

= O(∆).

(19)

Therefore, it is clear that in the ordinary scenarios, which were presented
by Feynman, both detecting approaches yield the same result. This fact
apparently suggests that the local measurement of a pair of particles is well
deﬁned. However, as can be seen from the following section, in some speciﬁc
cases the two approaches can be inconsistent.

Figure 1: The two rectangles represent the detectors and ψ1 and ψ2 are the two
wave functions. The distance between the centers of the is 2η and their width
is 2∆. In the case of spatial coordinate measurement measurement, these both
distances, η and ∆, shrink to zero.

4.3 A counterexample

Obviously, (16) does not exhaust all the possibilities and diﬀerent assump-
tions lead to diﬀerent results. The case considered below provides a coun-
terexamples to (1) and (2) (see [8]). Consider the case

1(x0)(x − x0) + O((x − x0)2) with ψ′

ψ1(x) = ψ′
ψ2(x) = ψ2(x0) + O(|x − x0|) with ψ2(x0) 6= 0 for x → x0.

1(x0) 6= 0 for x → x0

(20)

Then

p1(x1) = |ψ′
p(inter) = O((x1 − x0)(x2 − x0)),

1(x0)|2(x1 − x0)2 + O((x1 − x0)3)

It is concluded in [9] is that these results conﬁrm that bosons bunch and
fermions anti bunch. It is easy to see, however, that under the assumption

(32)

To interpret the diﬀerent orderings of the limits, we note that taking the
limit η → 0 ﬁrst corresponds to putting together two detectors of width
∆, thus rendering them a single detector. Taking the limit ∆ → 0 ﬁrst
corresponds to measuring the correlation between two detectors η apart.
However, (29) and (30) suggest that if 1 ≤ a, then there are always
two detectors and still, the ﬁnal results depend on the value of a. This is
clearly seen in Fig.2. The ratio between the same measurement of bosons
and distinguishable particles can vary dramatically as a function of a. These
results clearly contradict (15).

The above considerations indicate that there is a problem in the deﬁnition
of the spatial coordinate measurement of two identical particles, because
apparently equivalent measurement scenarios give diﬀerent results.

A similar anomaly occurs when one calculates the ratio between the prob-
abilities to measure simultaneously one boson by the left detector and one by
the right one (P (bos)
1 left and 1 right), and the probabilities to measure both of them
by the same detector (either left or right) (P (bos)
2 left or 2 right). For distinguishable

We see again that this ratio, which is expected to be 1, depends on the ratio
between η and ∆. In fact, only when the two detectors overlap completely,
that is, η = 0, the ratio is 1.

Again, changing the order of the limits changes the ﬁnal result. Clearly,

These results also indicate an anomaly in the simultaneous coordinate mea-
surements of two identical particles, which is not observed in the coordinate
measurement of distinguishable particles. All these limits are consistent with
the measurement of the spatial coordinate, however, they all lead to diﬀerent
ratios of measurement results.

There are statistical consequences to these considerations. First, because
this eﬀect occurs only in a neighborhood of the zeros of the single particle
wave function, there should be no spatial averaging, unlike that done in [14]
and [15]. Second, the manifestation of the anomaly requires that one of
the quantum states be locally antisymmetric around a zero. Therefore, the
ﬁrst bound state, which is approximately a Gaussian or an approximately
spherical wave function, is not a good candidate for the manifestation of this
eﬀect, in contrast to [16], [17], and [18]. It is therefore not surprising that
the phenomenon discussed here has not been observed experimentally so far.

5 Discussion, conclusions, and generalization

The paper reveals discrepancies in the realization of spatial coordinate mea-
surement of two indistinguishable particles (bosons or fermions), due to the
wave symmetrization postulate. It demonstrates that when one of the wave
functions changes sign at a point, then near this point there is an anomaly
in the measurement of the spatial coordinate of two identical particles. How-
ever, this anomaly does not occur for distinguishable particles. It is known [9]
that if two detectors are used, then spatial coordinate measurement requires
taking their width as well as the distance between them to zero. However,
the analysis presented in this paper shows that the order of the limits and
the ratio between these parameters has a large eﬀect on the ﬁnal result.
In
particular, it is shown that the bunching parameter is not a well-deﬁned.

It should be emphasized that despite the fact that we have focused in
this paper on the limits of these expressions, the eﬀect can be realized ex-

13

perimentally even for ﬁnite dimensions. As long as η << λ and ∆ << λ it
is suﬃcient to change the ratio between η and ∆ to witness the anomaly.

Note that assumption (20) is a particular case of the more general assump-
tion that the joint wave function (in higher dimensions as well) ψ1(x)/ψ2(x)
is antisymmetric in a small ball centered at x in the sense that ψ1(x +
εe)ψ2(x − εe) = −ψ1(x − εe)ψ2(x + εe) + o(ε) for all vectors e such that
|e| = 1 and ε ≪ 1. Moreover, it should be further noted that the above
discussion can be generalized from spatial coordinate, which is important for
realizations, to any continuous observable, such as momentum.
