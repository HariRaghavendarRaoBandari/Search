TIME DEPENDENT DELTA-PRIME INTERACTIONS IN DIMENSION ONE

CLAUDIO CACCIAPUOTI, ANDREA MANTILE, AND ANDREA POSILICANO

Abstract. We solve the Cauchy problem for the Schr¨odinger equation corresponding to the
family of Hamiltonians Hγ(t) in L2(R) which describes δ ′ interactions with time-dependent
strength 1/γ(t). We prove that the strong solution of such a Cauchy problem exits whenever the
map t 7→ γ(t) belongs to the fractional Sobolev space H 3/4(R), thus weakening the hypotheses
which would be required by the known general abstract results. The solution is expressed in
terms of the free evolution and the solution of a Volterra integral equation.

Keywords: time dependent point interactions, delta-prime interaction, non-autonomous Hamiltonians

1. Introduction

In this paper we address the generation problem for the family of time-dependent Hamiltonians
Hγ(t), where Hγ(t), for any ﬁxed real t, denotes the self-adjoint operator in L2(R) describing a
δ′-interaction of strength 1/γ(t) (see [29, 17], [6, Chapter I.4] and references therein).
Most of the literature on time dependent point interactions focuses on perturbations of the
free dynamics of the form of a Dirac’s delta time dependent potential.
In dimension three
time dependent δ-interactions were studied in [28, 31] and in [13] in relation with the problem
of ionization under periodic perturbations, see also [12]. In dimension two, very recently, the
problem of the well-posedness was studied in [11]. In dimension one, this kind of non-autonomous
Hamiltonians were analyzed in [20], see also [27].
It is well known that in dimension one the family of point perturbation of the Laplacian is
richer than in dimension two and three, and includes δ and δ′ perturbations, as well as their
In this paper we focus attention on the topical case of a time dependent δ′-
combinations.
interaction.
We remark that time-dependent δ-interactions have a non-linear counterpart, see, e.g., [1, 2,
3] in dimension three, and [4, 5]. More recently a systematic study of the blow-up in the
one dimensional case was started in [21].
In dimension one, in particular, such models ﬁnd
applications to the propagation of optical waves in Kerr media, or one-dimensional many body
systems, see, e.g., [15, 25, 19, 26] and references therein. The problem of the derivation of non-
linear δ-interactions from scaled regular dynamics was recently studied in [9] in dimension one,
and [10] in dimension three, see also [8].
Several results discussed in the present paper set the ground for the deﬁnition of non-linear point
interactions of δ′-type and for the study of the problem of their derivation from scaled regular
dynamics.
We recall that the deﬁnition of Hγ is given by the theory of self-adjoint extensions of the
symmetric operator

H◦ = −∆ ≡ −

d2
dx2 ,

D(H◦) = C∞0 (R\{0}) ,

and, for any real γ, reads as follows:

D(Hγ) = {ψ ∈ L2(R) : ψ = φ + qη, φ ∈ X 2, q ∈ C, φ′(0) = γq} ,

where η(x) := 1
2 sgn(x) and for any ν ≥ 0 we deﬁned X ν as the space of tempered distributions
with Fourier transform in L2(R,|k|2ν dk).
We remark that if f ∈ X ν, then its Fourier transform might be a distribution as well. Moreover,
for ν = m + σ, with m integer and 1/2 < σ ≤ 1, if f ∈ X ν then f ∈ C m(R), see Prop. 2.1 below.
Hence, φ in D(Hγ) is a C 1(R) function and φ′(0) in the boundary condition is well deﬁned.
The action of the operator Hγ can be understood also by exploiting the decomposition ψ = φ+qη:
this leads to

(1.3)

Hγψ(x) = −φ′′(x),

x ∈ R.

When γ(t) is assigned as a real valued function of time, the domain D(Hγ(t)) changes in time
with the boundary condition φ′(0) = γ(t)q. In contrast, the quadratic form corresponding to
Hγ is given by

Qγ(ψ) = kφ′k2 + γ|q|2 ,

D(Qγ) = {ψ ∈ L2(R) : ψ = φ + qη, φ ∈ X 1, q ∈ C},

and so Qγ(t) has a time-independent domain. Thus, by the abstract results in [23] and [27],
assuming that the map t 7→ γ(t) is diﬀerentiable, there exists an unitary propagator Ut,s in
L2(R), continuously mapping D(Hγ(s)) onto D(Hγ(t)), such that ψ(t) := Ut,0ψ0 is the (strong)
solution of the Cauchy problem

(i d

dt ψ(t) = Hγ(t)ψ(t)
ψ(0) = ψ0 ∈ D(Hγ(0)) .

However, as the case of time-dependent self-adjoint extensions Hα(t) (corresponding to δ-inter-
actions) studied in [20] suggests, the quite explicit knowledge of the action and operator domain
of Hγ should allow to solve the Cauchy problem (1.4) under weaker regularity conditions on γ(t).
Indeed, as we show in this paper, this is the case and problem (1.4) has an unique strong solution
whenever the map t 7→ γ(t) is in the fractional Sobolev space H 3/4(R), a condition weaker than
the diﬀerentiability hypotheses required in [23] and [27]. Such a H 3/4 hypothesis is the same
required in the paper [20] in order to guarantee that the Cauchy problem for the family Hα(t)
has a strong solution. However, in contrast to [20], here we make use neither of sophisticated
analytic tools (paraproducts) nor of abstract generation theorems (as the ones provided in [23]
and [22]); instead, following the same strategy as in the paper [14], we apply a more direct
approach which exploits the deﬁnitions (1.1) and (1.2), providing a relatively explicit expression
for the solution of (1.4) with initial datum ψ0 = φ0 + q0η in D(Hγ(0)):
(1.5)

ψ(t) = φ(t) + q(t)η

We shall prove the following well-posedness result:
Theorem 1. Let T > 0, γ ∈ H 3/4(0, T ), and set γ0 = γ(0). Let ψ0 = φ0 + q0η ∈ D(Hγ0).
Then for any t ∈ [0, T ] there exists a unique strong solution of the Cauchy problem (1.4) given
by ψ(t) = φ(t) + q(t)η as in Eqs. (1.6) - (1.8). Moreover the map t 7→ Hγ(t)ψ(t) belongs to
C([0, T ], L2(R)).

We brieﬂy discuss the heuristic derivation of the solution. The solution of the Schr¨odinger
equation with Hγ as Hamiltonian satisﬁes the distributional equation

(1.9)

∂t

ψ(t) = −ψ′′(t) + q(t)δ′0,

where δ′0 = δ′0(x) is the ﬁrst derivative of the Dirac delta-distribution. Let us assume, in the
ﬁrst part of this discussion, that the source term q(t) were an assigned function. Since η′′ = δ′0,
it is natural to seek for solutions of the form (1.5). Setting ψ(t) = φ(t) + q(t)η in Eq. (1.9) gives
the equation for φ(t)

i

∂
∂t

φ(t) = −φ′′(t) − i ˙q(t)η.

(1.6) follows directly from the Duhamel’s formula.

Eq.
Section 2.3 (in particular Eqs. (2.6) and (2.8)), one obtains the following equation for ψ(t)

Indeed by integration by parts, see

ψ(t) = eit∆ψ0 − iZ t

0

ds q(s)ei(t−s)∆δ′0 .

This can be understood as the Duhamel’s formula applied to Eq. (1.9).
The equation for q(t) is obtained by imposing the boundary condition φ′(0) = γq, using Eq.
(1.6) to compute the l.h.s. in the boundary condition. We postpone the details of the calculation
to Section 2.3. Here we note that the boundary condition turns the ﬂow associated to Eq. (1.9)
into a unitary ﬂow. In fact one can show that

d
dtkψ(t)k2 = 2 Im ¯q(t)φ′(0, t).

Hence, if the boundary condition is satisﬁed, one has d

dtkψ(t)k = 0.

We remark that a function ψ ∈ D(Hγ) can be written as the sum of a regular and singular part
with both functions in L2 by introducing a regularization parameter λ. More precisely, deﬁne

Gλ(x) := −

√λ|x|
e−
2√λ

λ > 0.

The function Gλ is the solution of the distributional equation G′′λ = δ0 + λGλ. The domain
D(Hγ) can be rewritten as

D(Hγ) =nψ ∈ L2(R) : ψ = φλ + qG′λ, φλ ∈ H 2(R), q ∈ C, φ′λ(0) =(cid:16)γ +

and the action of Hγ can be understood by the identity

√λ

2 (cid:17)qo,

(Hγ + λ)ψ(x) = −φ′′λ(x) + λφλ(x),

x ∈ R,

see, e.g., [6]. Eq. (1.3) is obtained by taking λ → 0.
We note that the charge equation (1.7) does not depend on λ, it is easy to see that

We note that, even if the regularization would avoid few issues with convolutions and Fourier
transforms, which must otherwise interpreted in distributional sense, it makes formulae more
involved and introduces an unnecessary parameter. For this reasons we decided to avoid it.

The paper consists of one additional section in which we prove Theorem 1.

2.1. Notation and preliminaries. In what follows C denotes a generic positive constant whose
value may change from line to line.
We denote by ˆψ the spatial Fourier transform of ψ

The time-Fourier transform of f is denoted by Ff and deﬁned as

Then the continuity of f (m) follows from the bounds (2.1) and (2.2), and the dominated conver-

(cid:3)

We will make use of fractional Sobolev spaces, for this reason we recall few deﬁnitions. For any
−∞ ≤ a < b ≤ +∞ and ν ∈ (0, 1), we set

[f ]H ν (a,b) := Z[a,b]2

dsds′|f (s) − f (s′)|2

|s − s′|1+2ν !1/2

,

which is sometimes referred to as Gagliardo (semi)norm of f . The space H ν(a, b), for −∞ ≤
a < b ≤ +∞ and ν ∈ (0, 1), is the space of functions for which the norm

kfkH ν (a,b) = kfkL2(a,b) + [f ]H ν (a,b)

5

is ﬁnite. To deﬁne the space H ν(a, b) for ν > 1 not integer, one sets ν = m + σ, where m is
an integer and σ ∈ (0, 1). Then H ν(a, b) is the space of functions such that f ∈ H m(a, b) and
f (m) ∈ H σ(a, b).
Remark 2.2. Note that, for ν ∈ (0, 1) there exists a constant Cν such that

[f ]H ν (R) = CνkFfkL2(R,|ω|2ν dω),

for any f ∈ X ν , this a direct consequence of Plancherel’s theorem (see [7], Proposition 1.37).
This identity, together with Prop. 2.1 implies that, for all ν > 1/2, and a and b ﬁnite, if f ∈ X ν
then f ∈ H ν(a, b), and, consequently, in H µ(a, b) for all 0 ≤ µ ≤ ν. Also, if f ∈ L2(a, b) and
f ∈ X ν , then f ∈ H ν(a, b), and, consequently, in H µ(a, b) for all 0 ≤ µ ≤ ν.
We recall that, for −∞ ≤ a < b ≤ +∞, the space L2(a, b) can be identiﬁed with H 0(a, b), and
L2(R) can be identiﬁed with X 0.
For the norms, we shall use the notation k · k = k · kL2(R).
We denote by I the operator

to any ν ≥ 0.
We shall also use the following:

Proposition 2.5. Let µ > 1/2 and 0 ≤ ν ≤ µ.

2.2. Well-posedness of the charge equation. In this section we study the well-posedness of
the charge equation (1.7).
We start with the following lemma which gives the regularity properties of the inhomogeneous
term in Eq. (1.7).
Lemma 2.6. Let φ0 ∈ X 2, then (U (·)φ0)′(0) ∈ X 3/4.
Proof. Since φ′0 ∈ L2(R) one has that the distributional identity

shows that (U (t)φ0)′ ∈ L2(R). By using the Fourier transform one has that

(U (t)φ0)′(x) =ZR

By splitting the integral in dk for k > 0 and k < 0, and by using the change of variables k = √ω

We are now ready to prove the main result of this section.
Lemma 2.7. Let T > 0, γ ∈ H 3/4(0, T ), and set γ0 = γ(0). Let ψ0 = φ0 + q0η ∈ D(Hγ0). Then
Eq. (1.7) admits a unique solution q ∈ H 5/4(0, T ).
Proof. We split the proof in two steps: ﬁrst we prove that there exists a unique solution q ∈
L2(0, T ), then, by a bootstrap argument, we show that such solution belongs to H 5/4(0, T ).
We start by step 1. We use several results from the monograph [18]. We set

Hence

γ(s)

√t − s

π

k(t, s) =r 4i
q(t) = f0(t) −Z t

ds k(t, s)q(s).

This is a linear nonconvolution Volterra equation to which we can apply the results in [18, Ch.
9]. We start by noticing that for any ﬁnite interval J ⊂ R+, k(t, s) is a Volterra kernel of type
L2, more precisely

|||k|||L2(J) :=

sup

khkL2(J )≤1
kgkL2 (J )≤1

ZJZJ

ds dt|h(t)k(t, s)g(s)| ≤ C|J|1/2kγkL∞(J).

Hence the interval [0, T ] can be divided into ﬁnitely many subintervals Ji such that |||k|||L2(Ji) <
1 on each Ji, and, as a consequence of Cor. 9.3.14 in [18], one has that k has a resolvent of type
L2 on [0, T ]. By applying Th. 9.3.6 of [18], we conclude that Eq. (2.4) has a unique solution in
L2(0, T ).

We can now proceed to the second step of the proof, which consists in showing that such a
solution belongs to H 5/4(0, T ). By Lemma 2.6 and Rem. 2.2, one has (U (·)φ0)′(0) ∈ H ν(0, T )
for all 0 ≤ ν ≤ 3/4. We set

Q(t) = q(t) − q0

and

F (t) = √4i((U (t)φ0)′(0) − γ(t)q(t))

t ∈ [0, T ].

7

We denote by ˜Q the function obtained by prolonging Q to zero outside [0, T ] and remark that
the claim ˜Q ∈ X ν implies Q ∈ H µ(0, T ) for all 0 ≤ µ ≤ ν, see Rem. 2.2, therefore q ∈ H µ(0, T ).
By the charge equation (1.7), the identity Q = IF holds true for a.a.
t ∈ [0, T ], here I is
the operator deﬁned in (2.3). Since, by Prop. 2.5, F ∈ L2(0, T ) we can deﬁne ˜F ∈ L2(R)
by extending it to zero. Then, by Lemma 2.3, ˜Q = I ˜F ∈ X 1/2, hence, Q ∈ H 1/4(0, T ) and
q ∈ H 1/4(0, T ).
We can repeat the argument. We start with the observation that now we know that F ∈
H 1/4(0, T ) and conclude that q ∈ H 3/4(0, T ). Here we use Lemma 2.4-i) to claim that ˜F ∈
H 1/4(R) which in turn implies ˜F ∈ X 1/4.
To conclude the proof we must slightly adjust the argument above. So far we have proved that
F ∈ H 3/4(0, T ), moreover we know that F (0) = 0, because the boundary condition φ′0(0) = γ0q0
holds true by assumption. Deﬁne F s : [0, 2T ] → C by reﬂection of F about t = T . We have that
F s(0) = F s(2T ) = 0. We deﬁne ˜F s : R → C by extending F s to zero and use Lemma 2.4-ii) to
claim that ˜F s ∈ H 3/4(R), and, consequently, ˜F ∈ X 3/4. Applying again Lemma 2.3 we conclude
that q ∈ H 5/4(0, T ).

(cid:3)

2.3. Proof of Theorem 1. The function φ(t) deﬁned by Eq. (1.6) exists and is unique for all
t ∈ [0, T ]. Next we prove that φ(t) ∈ X 2. Let us rewrite Eq. (1.6) as

where we set

(2.5)

φ(t) = U (t)φ0 + ˜φ(t),

˜φ(t) = −Z t

0

ds ˙q(s)U (t − s)η.

One has that U (t)φ0 ∈ X 2, because k \U (t)φ0kL2(R,|k|4dk) = k ˆφ0kL2(R,|k|4dk).
We are left to prove that ˜φ ∈ X 2. We recall that the Fourier transform of η is the distribution
−i PV 1

Here the latter inequality follows from the same argument used in the proof of Prop. 3.3 in [10].
Next we prove that ψ(t) = φ(t) + q(t)η ∈ L2(R). Since φ(t) ∈ C 1(R), see Prop. 2.1, and η is
loc(R). Hence, it is enough to prove that (1 − χ)ψ(t) ∈ L2(R), where χ is the
bounded, ψ(t) ∈ L2
characteristic function of the interval [−1, 1]. In the deﬁnition of φ(t), see Eq. (1.6), we use the
identity

Next we prove that the boundary condition φ′(0) = γ(t)q holds true for all t ∈ [0, T ]. From Eq.
(2.7) we obtain

We gained a factor 1/x which gives the bound

(2.9)

Hence

(U (t)η)′(0) =

We apply the operator I, deﬁned in (2.3), and use the charge equation (1.7) to obtain

φ′(0, t) = (U (t)φ0)′(0) −Z t

By Eq. (1.3), to prove the continuity of the map t 7→ Hγ(t)ψ(t) in L2(R) it is enough to show
the continuity of kφ′′(t)k. As the continuity of U (t)φ0 is obvious, we just need to show that

By Eqs. (2.5) and (2.3), this is reduced to show that
