HUIJUN YANG

Abstract. Let X be an (8k + i)-dimensional pathwise connected CW-complex
with i = 1 or 2 and k ≥ 0, ξ be a real vector bundle over X. Suppose that ξ
admits a stable complex structure over the 8k-skeleton of X. Then we get that
ξ admits a stable complex structure over X if the Steenrod square

Sq2 : H8k−1(X; Z/2) → H8k+1(X; Z/2)

is surjective. As an application, let M be a 10-dimensional manifold with no
2-torsion in Hi(M; Z) for i = 1, 2, 3, and no 3-torsion in H1(M; Z). Suppose
that the Steenrod square

Sq2 : H7(M; Z/2) → H9(M; Z/2)

is surjective. Then the necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the existence of
a stable almost complex structure on M are given in terms of the cohomology
ring and characteristic classes of M.

1. Introduction

First we introduce some notations. For a topological space X, let VectC(X)
(resp. VectR(X)) be the set of isomorphic classes of complex (resp. real) vector
bundles on X, and let eK(X) (resp. gKO(X)) be the reduced KU-group (resp. re-

duced KO-group) of X, which is the set of stable equivalent classes of complex
(resp. real) vector bundles over X. For a map f : X → Y between topological
spaces X and Y, denote by

the induced homomorphisms. For ξ ∈ VectR(X) (resp. η ∈ VectC(X)), we will

denote by ˜ξ ∈ gKO(X) (resp. ˜η ∈ eK(X)) the stable class of ξ (resp. η). Moreover,

we will denote by

In particular, if X is a smooth manifold, we denote by

wi(X) = wi(T X)
pi(X) = pi(T X)

the i-th Stiefel-Whitney class of X,
the i-th Pontrjagin class of X,

where T X is the tangent bundle of X.

It is known that there are natural homomorphisms

which induced from

˜rX : eK(X) → gKO(X)
˜cX : gKO(X) → eK(X)
rX : VectC(X) → VectR(X)
cX : VectR(X) → VectC(X)

the real reduction,

the complexiﬁcation,

the real reduction,
the complexiﬁcation,

respectively. Let ξ ∈ VectR(X) be a real vector bundle over X. We say that ξ
admits a stable complex structure over X if there exists a complex vector bundle
η over X such that ˜rX(˜η) = ˜ξ, that is ˜ξ ∈ Im ˜rX. In particular, if X is a smooth
manifold, we say that X admits a stable almost complex structure if T X admits a
stable complex structure.

Let U = lim
n→∞

U(n) (resp. S O = lim
n→∞

S O(n)) be the stable unitary (resp.
special orthogonal) group. Denote by Γ = S O/U. Let Xq be the q-skeleton of X,
and denote by i : Xq → X the inclusion map of q-skeleton of X. Suppose that ξ
admits a stable complex structure over Xq, that is there exists a complex vector
bundle η over Xq such that

o(˜ξ) = ˜rXq(˜η).

Then the obstruction to extending η over the (q + 1)-skeleton of X is denoted by

oq+1(η) ∈ Hq+1(X, πq(Γ))

where

πq(Γ) =

If q ≡ 2 mod 4, that is the coeﬃcient group πq(Γ) = Z, the obstructions

oq+1(η) have been investigated by Massey [12, Theorem I]. For example,
(1.1)
where β : Hi(M; Z/2) → Hi+1(M; Z) is the Bockstein homomorphism. Moreover,
if q ≡ −1 mod 8, hence πq(Γ) = Z/2, the obstruction o8(η) has been studied by
Massey [12, Theorem III] , Thomas [16, Theorem 1.2] , Heaps [11], M. ˇCadek,
M. Crabb and J. Vanˇzura [6, Proposition 4.1 (a)], Dessai [8, Theorem 1.9] and
Yang[18, Corollary 1.6], etc. Furthermore, when X is a n-dimensional closed
oriented smooth manifold with n ≡ 0 mod 8, the obstruction on(η) is determined

by Yang [18, Theorem 1.1]. However, in the case q ≡ 0 mod 8, we only known
that oq+1(η) = 0 if Hq+1(X; Z/2) = 0.

In this paper, the obstructions oq+1(η) for q ≡ 0 mod 8 are investigated and

our results can be state as follows.

Denote by Sq2 : Hi(X; Z/2) → Hi+2(X; Z) the Steenrod square.

Theorem 1. Let X be a (8k + i)-dimensional pathwise connected CW-complex
with i = 1 or 2 and k the non-negative integral number, ξ be a real vector bundle
over X. Suppose that X satisfying the condition
(∗)
Then ξ admits a stable complex structure over X if and only if it admits a stable
complex structure over X8k.

Sq2 : H8k−1(X; Z/2) → H8k+1(X; Z/2)

is surjective.

Remark 1.1. This theorem tell us that the ﬁnal obstruction

o8k+1(η) = 0

if X satisfying the condition (∗). The following examples tell us that the CW-
complexes which satisfying the condition (∗) are exists .
Example 1.2. Trivial case: the CW-complex X with H8k+1(X; Z/2) = 0.
Example 1.3. Denote by Gk(Rn+k) the Grassmannian of k-planes in real n + k
dimensional space Rn+k, ζk,n the universal k-plane bundle over Gk(Rn+k).
It is
known that (cf. Borel [3]) dim Gk(Rn+k) = kn and

H∗(Gk(Rn+k); Z/2) (cid:27) Z/2[w1, · · · , wk, ¯w1, · · · , ¯wn]/Ik,n
where wi = wi(ζk,n) and Ik,n is the ideal generated by the equations

(1 + w1 + · · · + wk)(1 + ¯w1 + · · · + ¯wn) = 0.

Hence we get that dim G3(R6) = 9, dim G2(R7) = 10 and
H∗(G3(R6); Z/2) (cid:27) Z/2[w1, w2, w3]/hw4

Example 1.4. Denote by CP2 the 2-dimensional complex projective space, S l
the l-dimensional sphere. One may easily verify that the following manifolds are
all satisfying the condition (∗):

• M1 = CP2 × S 5 × S 1,
• M2 = M1 × S 8k, k > 0,
• ♯nMi the connected sum of n copies of Mi, i = 1, 2,
• etc.

Let M be an n-dimensional closed oriented smooth manifold. It is a classical
topic in geometry and topology to determine the necessary and suﬃcient condi-
tions for M to admits a stable almost complex structure. These are only known
in the case n ≤ 8 (cf. [17], [9], [12], [16], [11], [7], [6], [18], etc.). If n = 10,
Thomas and Heaps determined these conditions in the case H1(M; Z/2) = 0 and
w4(M) = 0 (cf. [16, Theorem 1.6] and [11, Theorem 2]). Moreover, Dessai [8,
Theorems 1.2, 1.9] got them in the case H1(M; Z) = 0 and Hi(M; Z), i = 2, 3 has
no 2-torsion, no assumption on w4(M) is made.

One may see from the proof of [16, Theorem 1.6] and [11, Theorem 2] that
the assumption H1(M; Z/2) = 0 is used just to guarantee that the ﬁnal obstruction
o9(η) = 0. So as an application of Theorem 1, the assumption H1(M; Z/2) = 0
in [16, Theorem 1.6] and [11, Theorem 2] can be replaced by the assumption
that the Stennrod square Sq2 : H7(M; Z/2) → H9(M; Z/2) is surjective. That is
trivial, we will not list them here.

As the second application of Theorem 1, we can get the following result.

From now on, M will be a 10-dimensional closed oriented smooth manifold
with no 2-torsion in Hi(M; Z), i = 1, 2, 3 and no 3-torsion in H1(M; Z). We may
also suppose that the Steenrod square

Sq2 : H7(M; Z/2) → H9(M; Z/2)

is surjective.

Since H2(M; Z) has no 2-torsion, it follows from the universal coeﬃcient
theorem that H3(M; Z) has no 2-torsion. Hence the mod 2 reduction homomor-
phism

ρ2 : H2(M; Z) → H2(M; Z/2)

is surjective by using the long exact Bockstein sequence associated to the coeﬃ-
cient sequence

Therefore M is spinc. We may ﬁx an element c ∈ H2(M; Z) satisfying

0 → Z

2
−→ Z → Z/2 → 0.

Deﬁnition 1.5. Set

ρ2(c) = w2(M).

D(M) , {x ∈ H2(M; Z) | x2 + cx = 2zx for some zx ∈ H4(M; Z)}

where ( uniquely determined ) zx is depending on x. One may ﬁnd that D(M) is
a subgroup of H2(M; Z) and it does not depend on the choice of c.

Theorem 2. Let M be a 10-dimensional closed oriented smooth manifold with
no 2-torsion in Hi(M; Z), i = 1, 2, 3, no 3-torsion in H1(M; Z). Suppose that the
Steenrod square

Sq2 : H7(M; Z/2) → H9(M; Z/2)

is surjective. Then M admits a stable almost complex structure if and only if
(1.2)

w2
4(M) · ρ2(x) = (Sq2ρ2(zx)) · w4(M)

holds for every x ∈ D(M).

Remark 1.6. This theorem is a generalization of Dessai [8, Theorem]. In fact, the
congruence (1.2) is a simpliﬁcation of the congruence (1.2) in [8, Theorem 1.2].

Remark 1.7. One may ﬁnd that we only need to check the congruence (1.2) for
the generators of D(M).

Obviously, one can get that

Corollary 1.8. Let M be as in Theorem 2. Suppose that w4(M) = 0. Then M
always admits a stable almost complex structure.

Remark 1.9. Compare Thomas [16, Theorem 1.6].

For M which has ”nice” cohomology, we have

Corollary 1.10. Let M be as in Theorem 2. Assume in addition that H2(M; Z)
is generated by h and h2 . 0 mod 2. Then M always admits a stable complex
structure.

Remark 1.11. Compare Dessai [8, Corollary 1.3].

Example 1.12. One can deduced easily from Corollary 1.10 that the manifold
CP2 × S 5 × S 1 (in Example 1.4) must admits a stable complex structure. In fact,
CP2 × S 5 × S 1 is a complex manifold because both CP2 and S 5 × S 1 are complex
manifold. Moreover, it follows from Theorem 2 and the cohomology ring of
♯nCP2 × S 5 × S 1, n ≥ 1 that they all admit a stable almost complex structure.

This paper is arranged as follows. Firstly, the Theorem 1 is proved in §2.
Then in order to prove the Theorem 2 and the Corollary 1.10 in §4 , we investi-
gated the obstruction to extend complex vector bundles over the (2q −1)-skeleton
of X to (2q + 1)-skeleton in §3.

2. The proof of Theorem 1

Let X be a (8k+i)-dimensional pathwise connected CW-complex, i = 1 or 2.
In this section, combining the Bott exact sequence with the Atiyah-Hirzebruch
spectral sequence of KO∗(X), we give the proof of Theorem 1.

Let BU (resp. BO) be the classifying space of the stable unitary group U
(resp. stable orthogonal group O). Since O/U is homotopy equivalent to Ω−6BO
(cf. [4]), the canonical ﬁbering

O/U ֒→ BU → BO

gives rise to a long exact sequence of K-groups ( we call it the Bott exact se-
quence ):

which is similar to the exact sequence given by Bott in [5, p.75].

According to Switzer [14, pp.336-341], the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral se-

quence of KO∗(X) is the spectral sequence {E p,q
r

, dr} with

E p,q
2 (cid:27) H p(X; KOq),
E p,q
∞ (cid:27) F p,q/F p+1,q−1,

where

F p,q = Ker [i∗

o : KOp+q(X) → KOp+q(X p−1)],

and the coeﬃcient ring of KO-theory is (cf. Bott [5, p. 73])

KO∗ = Z[α, x, γ, γ−1]/(2α, α3, αx, x2 − 4γ)

with the degrees | α |= −1, | x |= −4 and | γ |= −8.

It is well known that the diﬀerentials d2 of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral
sequence of KO∗(X) are given as follows (see M. Fujii [10, Formula (1.3)] for
instance):

sions. Then by the naturality of the long exact sequence of K theory, we got the

Therefore, this lemma can be deduced easily from the facts that K1(X, X8k+1) = 0
and ˜r : K1(X8k+1, X8k) → KO1(X8k+1, X8k) is injective.
(cid:3)
Lemma 2.2. If the Steenrod square Sq2 : H8k−1(X; Z/2) → H8k+1(X; Z/2) is sur-
jective, we must have

Im j∗

o ⊆ Im ˜rX.

Proof. In the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, since KO−1(X, X8k+1) = 0, it
follows that

F8k+2,8k−3 = Ker[i∗

o : KO−1(X) → KO−1(X8k+1)] = 0.

Hence

E8k+1,8k−2

∞

= F8k+1,8k−2/F8k+2,8k−3 = F8k+1,8k−2.

Therefore, by the equation (2.2), the surjectivity of the Steenrod square

Sq2 : H8k−1(X; Z/2) → H8k+1(X; Z/2)

implies that

F8k+1,8k−2 = E8k+1,8k−2

∞

= 0.

That is, the homomorphism i∗
follows from the exactness of the diagram (2.3) that the homomorphism

o : KO−1(X) → KO−1(X8k) is injective. Then it

is a zero homomorphism. So the composition homomorphism

o : KO−1(X, X8k) → KO−1(X)
j∗

γX ◦ j∗

o = j∗

o ◦ γ = 0,

and we get that

Im j∗

o ⊆ Im ˜rX.

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1. Obviously, ξ admits a stable complex structure over X im-
plies that ξ admits a stable complex structure over X8k.

Conversely, suppose that ξ admits a stable complex structure over X8k. That

is there exists a stable complex vector bundle ˜η′ ∈ eK(X8k) such that

˜rX8k(˜η′) = i∗

o(˜ξ).

Then it follows from the exactness of the diagram (2.3) and the Lemma 2.1 that
there is a stable complex vector bundle ˜η1 such that i∗

u(˜η1) = ˜η′ and

That is,

o(˜rX(˜η1) − ˜ξ) = 0.
i∗

˜rX(˜η1) − ˜ξ ∈ Im j∗
o.

Therefore, by the Lemma 2.2, the surjectivity of the Steenrod Square

Sq2 : H8k−1(X; Z/2) → H8k+1(X; Z/2)

implies that ξ admits a stable complex structure over X.

3. The obstruction for an extension of a vector bundle over X2q−1 to X2q+1

Let X be a pathwise connected CW-complex. In order to prove Theorem 2,
in this section, we will investigate the obstruction for an extension of a complex
vector bundle over the (2q − 1)-skeleton X2q−1 of X to the (2q + 1)-skeleton X2q+1.
Theorem 3.1. Let X be a pathwise connected CW-complex and ˜η ∈ eK(X2q−1) a
stable complex vector bundle over X2q−1. Denote by ϑ2q+1(˜η) ∈ H2q+1(X; Z) the
obstruction to extend ˜η to X2q+1. Then

(q − 1)! · ϑ2q+1(˜η) = 0.

Proof. . Denote by i : X2q−1 → X2q and j : X2q → (X2q, X2q−1) the inclusions. Let
f : ` S 2q → X2q be the attaching map such that

X2q+1 = X2q ∪ f a D2q+1,

where the symbol` means the disjoint union. Then it follows from eK(S 2q−1) (cid:27) 0

that we have the following diagram

where ∆2q = f ∗
u and the horizontal and vertical sequences are the long exact
sequences of K groups for the pairs (X2q, X2q−1) and (X2q+1, X2q) respectively.
Therefore, for any ˜η ∈ eK(X2q−1), there must exists a stable complex vector bundle
˜η′ ∈ eK(X2q) such that i∗

u(˜η′) = ˜η, and ˜η can be extended to X2q+1 if and only if

u (˜η′) ∈ Im ∆2q.

Denote by

the suspension which is a isomorphism,

f ∗ : H2q(X2q; Z) → H2q(a S 2q; Z)

and

j∗ : H2q(X2q, X2q−1; Z) → H2q(X2q; Z)

the homomorphisms induced by the maps f and j respectively. It is known that
the Chern characters

ch : eK(a S 2q) → H2q(a S 2q; Z)

are all isomorphisms, and the composition homomorphism

Σ ◦ ch ◦ ∆2q ◦ ch−1 : H2q(X2q, X2q−1; Z) → H2q+1(X2q+1, X2q; Z)

is just the cellular coboudary homomorphism

d2q = Σ ◦ f ∗ ◦ j∗ : H2q(X2q, X2q−1; Z) → H2q+1(X2q+1, X2q; Z)

of the cellular cochain complex of X (cf. Atiyah and Hirzebruch [2, pp. 16-18]).

Hence by the equation (3.1), the obstruction

ϑ2q+1(˜η) ∈ H2q+1(X; Z)

is just the cohomology class represented by

Σ ◦ ch( f ∗

u (˜η′)) = Σ (

u (˜η′))
cq( f ∗
(q − 1)!

).

Therefore, it follows from the surjectivity of j∗ and d2q = Σ ◦ f ∗ ◦ j∗ that

(q − 1)! · o(˜η) = 0.

(cid:3)

Corollary 3.2. Let X be a CW-complex. Suppose that H2q+1(X; Z) contains no
(q − 1)!-torsion. Then every stable complex vector bundle over X2q−1 can be
extended to a complex vector bundle over X2q+2.

Proof. Note that the homomorphism i∗

u : eK(X2q+2) → eK(X2q+1) is surjective.

(cid:3)

Similarly we can get that

Theorem 3.3. Let X be a pathwise connected CW-complex and ˜ξ ∈ gKO(X4q−1)
(resp. ˜γ ∈ gKS p(X4q−1)) a stable real (resp. symplectic ) vector bundle over X4q−1.
Denote by ϑ4q+1(˜ξ) ∈ H4q+1(X; Z) (resp. ϑ4q+1(˜γ) ∈ H4q+1(X; Z)) the obstruction
to extend ˜ξ (resp. ˜γ) to X4q+1. Then

(2q − 1)! · aq · ϑ4q+1(˜ξ) = 0,
(2q − 1)! · bq · ϑ4q+1(˜ξ) = 0,

where aq · bq = 2 and aq = 1 for q even and aq = 2 for q odd.

4. The proof of Theorem 2

In this section, we will take Dessai’s strategy, which was used to prove [8,

Theorem 1.2], to prove the Theorem 2.

Recall that M is a 10-dimensional closed oriented smooth manifold with no
2-torsion in Hi(M; Z), i = 1, 2, 3 and no 3-torsion in H1(M; Z). It also satisfying
that the Steenrod square

Sq2 : H7(M; Z/2) → H9(M; Z/2)

10

is surjective. Then M is spinc, and we have ﬁxed an element c ∈ H2(M; Z)
satisfying ρ2(c) = w2(M) and deﬁned

D(M) , {x ∈ H2(M; Z) | x2 + cx = 2zx for some zx ∈ H4(M; Z)}.

Denote by i∗

u : eK(M) → eK(M7) and j∗

u : eK(M) → eK(M8) the homomor-
phisms induced by the inclusions i : M7 → M and j : M8 → M respectively.
Let p∗ : Hi(M; Z) → Hi(M; Q) be the homomorphism induced by the canonical
inclusion p : Z → Q. Recall that ˜rMq : eK(Mq) → gKO(Mq) is the real reduction
Lemma 4.1. M has the following properties:

homomorphism. Then we get that

ρ2(D(M)).

is well deﬁned on p∗(H8(M; Z)).

Moreover, if ˜rM8 j∗

u(˜η) = ˜η′.

u(˜η) = j∗

Proof. (a) Since Hi(M; Z) has no 2-torsion for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 10, the same is true
for Hi(M; Z), i , 5, 6 ( universal coeﬃcient theorem and Poinar´e Duality ).
Hence the statement is true by using the long exact Bockstein sequence.

(b) That is because the kernel of p∗ : H8(M; Z) → H8(M; Q) is an odd torsion

which maps to zero under ρ2.

(c) Let y ∈ H2(M; Z/2). Note that the Wu class V2 is w2(M). Then it follows

from Cartan formula that for any z ∈ H6(M; Z)

y · Sq2ρ2(z) = 0

iﬀ

(w2(M) · y + y2) · ρ2(z) = 0.

Hence the statement is true by the statement (a) and the deﬁnition of D(M).
(d) Since H9(M; Z) (cid:27) H1(M; Z) has no 2-torsion and 3-torsion, the statement

can be deduced easily from Corollary 3.2.

(e) The statements can be proved by combining the identity (1.1) and the state-

ment (d) with the Theorem 1.

SOME REMARKS ON STABLE ALMOST COMPLEX STRUCTURES ON MANIFOLDS

For any x ∈ D(M), we may choose a class vx ∈ H6(M; Z) such that

ρ2(vx) = Sq2ρ2zx.

Since M has the properties as in Lemma 4.1, the results below can be deduced
easily by apllying the methods of Dessai in [8].

Lemma 4.2. Let ˜ξ ∈ gKO(M) be a stable oriented vector bundle over M. Then ˜ξ

admits a stable complex structure if and only if

ρ2 ◦ p−1

Lemma 4.3. Let c ∈ H2(M; Z) be an integral class satisfying ρ2(c) = w2(M). For
any x ∈ D(M) there is a stable complex vector bundle ˜ηx ∈ eK(M) trivial over the

3-skeleton such that

u(˜η) = i∗

Lemma 4.4. Let M be a 10-dimensional closed oriented smooth manifold as in

Theorem 2. Let ˜ξ ∈ gKO(M) be a stable real vector bundle over M. Choose c ∈
H2(M; Z) (resp. d ∈ H2(M; Z)) satisfying ρ2(c) = w2(M) (resp. ρ2(d) = w2(˜ξ)).
Then ˜ξ admits a stable complex structure if and only if
(4.1)
holds for every x ∈ D(M).

h ˆA(M) · ec/2 · ch(˜lx − ˜ηx) · ch(˜cM(˜ξ − ˜ld)), [M]i ≡ 0 mod 2

Proof of the Lemmas 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4. cf.
Theorem 1.9].
Remark 4.5. Since M is spinc, it follow from the Diﬀerentiable Riemann-Roch
theorem (cf. Atiyah-Hirzebruch [1, Corollary 1]) that the rational number

(cid:3)

h ˆA(M) · ec/2 · ch(˜lx − ˜ηx) · ch(˜cM(˜ξ − ˜ld)), [M]i
is integral, so it make sense to take congruent classes modulo 2.

In fact, the congruence (4.1) can be simpliﬁed, hence Lemma 4.4 can be

restated as follows.
Theorem 4.6. Let M be a 10-dimensional closed oriented smooth manifold with
no 2-torsion in Hi(M; Z), i = 1, 2, 3, no 3-torsion in H1(M; Z). Suppose that the
Steenrod square

Sq2 : H7(M; Z/2) → H9(M; Z/2)

is surjective. Let ξ be a real vector bundle over M. Choose integral class d ∈
H2(M; Z) such that ρ2(d) = w2(ξ). Set

holds for every x ∈ D(M).

Remark 4.7. One may ﬁnd that the rational number Aξ,x is integral (see the proof
of this Theorem below), so it make sense to take congruent classes modulo 2.

Proof. Let F = ˜ξ − ˜ld. Then F is a stable spin vector bundle since w2(F) = 0.
Therefore, the spin characteristic classes

qi(F) ∈ H4i(M; Z), i = 1, 2,

of F are deﬁned, and they satisfy the following relations (cf. Thomas [15])

p1(F) = 2q1(F),
p2(F) = 2q2(F) + q2

1(F),

ρ2(q1(F)) = w4(F),
ρ2(q2(F)) = w8(F).

Since we have the equations below

x3 = 2xzx − 2czx + c2x,

q1(F) = (p1(ξ) − d2)/2,
w4(F) = w4(ξ),
w8(F) = w8(ξ) + w2(ξ)w6(ξ) + w2
w6(ξ) = Sq2(w4(ξ)) + w2(ξ)w4(ξ),

2(ξ)w4(ξ),

it follows that

h ˆA(M) · ec/2 · ch(˜lx − ˜ηx) · ch(˜cM(˜ξ − ˜ld)), [M]i ≡ 0 mod 2

Proof of Theorem 2. Denote by Vi ∈ Hi(M; Z/2) the Wu-class which is the unique
class satisfying

Sqiu = Vi · u

Note that for any x ∈ D(M), we have

ρ2
2(x) = ρ2(x) · w2(M).

Therefore, for any x ∈ D(M), we can get that

ρ2(x)w2(M)Sq2w4(M) = Sq2(ρ2(x)w2(M)w4(M))

= ρ2(x)w2

2(M)w4(M).

Hence

Then Theorem 2 can be deduced easily from the Theorem 4.6 and the iden-
(cid:3)

tity (4.3) by choosing that ξ = T M and d = c.

Proof of Corollary 1.10. If M is spin, D(M) generated by 2h. Hence the congru-
ence (1.2) is always true.

If M is not spin, D(M) generated by h and ρ2(h) = w2(M). Therefore, we
only need to check the congruence (1.2) for x = h. Note that the Wu class V5 is
zero. In this case, zx = h2,
4(M)ρ2(x) = w2(M)w2
w2
and

4(M)) = (Sq1w4(M))2 = Sq5Sq1w4(M) = 0,

4(M) = Sq2(w2

Sq2(zx)w4(M) = Sq2(h2)w4(M) = 0.

Hence the congruence (1.2) is always true for this case.

These prove the Corollary 1.10.
