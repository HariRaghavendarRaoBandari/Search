Abstract
The energy range of our earlier measured activation cross-sections data of longer-lived products of deuteron in-
duced nuclear reactions on indium were extended from 40 MeV up to 50 MeV. The traditional stacked foil irra-
diation technique and non-destructive gamma spectrometry were used. No experimental data were found in lit-
erature for this higher energy range. Experimental cross-sections for the formation of the radionuclides 113,110Sn,
116m,115m,114m,113m,111,110g,109In and 115Cd are reported in the 37-50 MeV energy range, for production of 110Sn and
110g,109In these are the ﬁrst measurements ever. The experimental data were compared with the results of cross section
calculations of the ALICE and EMPIRE nuclear model codes and of the TALYS1.6 nuclear model code as listed in
the on-line library TENDL-2014.

Keywords: indium target, deuteron activation, Sn, In and Cd radioisotopes

1. Introduction

In the frame of our systematic study of charged parti-
cle induced activation, we earlier investigated the ac-
tivation cross sections induced by deuterons on natu-
ral indium targets (T´ark´anyi et al., 2011). The main
aim was then to study the production possibility of
the 113/113mIn medical generator up to the available 40
MeV deuteron energy at the CYRIC (Tohoku Univer-
sity) AVF cyclotron. The activation cross sections on
indium are however of importance not only for the men-
tioned generator, but four other medically relevant ra-
dionuclides can be produced: 114mIn (49.51 d), 113mIn
(99.476 min), 111In (2.8047 d) and 110mIn (69.1 min).
For the last three, apart from direct reactions also de-
cay from parent 113Sn (115.09 d), 111Sn (35.3 min) and
110Sn (4.11 h) is contributing. Taking into account that
no earlier data are available above 40 MeV incident
deuteron energy and having the possibility to irradiate
in the 50 MeV beam of the LLN Cyclone 90 cyclotron,
we decided to extend the energy range of our previous
study. Similar investigation is in progress on cross sec-
tions of proton induced reactions on indium up to 70

MeV by using diﬀerent accelerators. The possible ap-
plications of the experimental data are discussed in our
2011 publication. Here we summarize the new experi-
mental results, including only a short summary of the
speciﬁc characteristics of experimental technique and
the data evaluation method. The theoretical results cal-
culated with ALICE-D code (Dityuk et al., 1998) and
the EMPIRE-D code (Herman et al., 2007) were taken
from the previous work, while for the calculation with
the Talys code (Koning et al., 2007) the latest data avail-
able in the TENDL-2014 library (Koning and Rochman,
2013), based on the TALYS 1.6 version were used.

2. Experiment and data evaluation

For the cross section determination an activation
method based on stacked foil irradiation technique and
followed by γ-ray spectrometry were used. In order to
avoid contamination of the stack by indium or its ac-
tivation products in the case of accidental overheating,
the In targets consisted of sandwiches of thin In foils
backed by 50 µm Al and covered by a thin (6 µm)
Al foil. The stack bombarded for 3600 s with a 50
MeV deuteron beam of 32 nA at Louvain la Neuve con-
sisted of a sequence of Rh, Al, Al-In-Al, Pd, Al, Nb,
Al foils (thicknesses are in Table 1) repeated 9 times.

Figure 2: Experimental and theoretical cross sections for the forma-
tion of 113Sn by the deuteron bombardment of indium

The deuteron beam was degraded from 50 MeV down
to 32 MeV in the last In foil of the stack, assuring a
good energy overlap with the 2011 study. Additional
details on experiment, on beam parameters and on the
data evaluation can be found in our earlier works made
at same accelerator by using the same technique (Her-
manne et al., 2014). The main experimental parame-
ters and the methods of data evaluation for the present
study are summarized in Table 1. The used decay data
are collected in Table 2. The experimental data were
measured relative to the 27Al(d,x)24Na monitor reac-
tion (see Fig. 1). The uncertainty of the experimental
points was estimated by the common technique accord-
ing to the ISO guide (International-Bureau-of-Weights-
and-Measures, 1993). The calculated experimental un-
certainties are as follows: number of target nuclei in-
cluding non-uniformity (5 %), incident deuteron ﬂux (7
%), peak area including statistical errors of counts (0.1-
20 %), detector eﬃciency (5 %), γ-ray abundance and
branching ratio (3 %). Except for a few data points the
total uncertainty of 10-15 % was obtained as positive
square root of the quadratic sum of the individual un-
certainty sources. Possible additional uncertainties due
to non-linear eﬀects of half-lives and cooling time were
not taken into account.

3. Cross sections

The measured cross sections for the production
of 113,110Sn,116m,115m,114m,113m,111,110g,109In and 115Cd are
shown in Table 3 and Figures 2-11. The ﬁgures also
show the theoretical results calculated with the ALICE-
IPPE-D and the EMPIRE-D codes and the values avail-

able in the TALYS based TENDL-2014 library. The
results for 115gCd are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent compared
what was published in our earlier work in the over-
lapping energy range. After a detailed check of both
data evaluations an input mistake was discovered in the
calculation sheet (the detector eﬃciency) of the earlier
work. The results were corrected and are shown in Fig.
11. In most of the other excitation function a slight sys-
tematic shift can be observed, which could be caused
by the diﬀerent spectrometer system (eﬃciency calibra-
tion) and by the fact that all of our measurements are
relative measurements to the monitor reactions. An im-
provement in the monitor reaction data can result in a
modiﬁed excitation function by the nuclear reactions in
question. The theoretical model calculations are taken
from our previous work (except TENDL-2014 and for
110Sn, 110gIn and 109In isotopes), which are new, com-
pared to our previous work.

3.1. 113Sn

The excitation function of 113Sn (Fig. 2) was mea-
sured after total decay of the short-lived meta-stable
state (21.4 min, IT 91 %) to the long-lived ground state
(115.1 d). An acceptable agreement with our earlier
measurements can be seen. Clear improvement of de-
scription by the TALYS code in the new TENDL data
can be observed.

3.2. 110Sn

The experimental excitation functions for production
of 110Sn (4.11 h) are shown in Fig. 3 in comparison
with the TENDL-2014 predictions. Because it is a new

3.3. 116m1In(m2+)

The cross sections of the ﬁrst metastable state (54.29
min) were measured after complete decay of the second
metastable state (2.18 s), which decays to m1 by 100
% IT (Fig. 4). An acceptable agreement with our ear-
lier measurements has been observed. No real change
in description by TALYS code was done. All theoret-
ical model calculations underestimate the experimental
values except ALICE-D above 35 MeV.

3.4. 115mIn

The 115mIn metastable state (4.486 h) can be produced
directly via the 115In(d,pn) reaction and through decay
of 115Cd. No gamma-lines from the decay of signiﬁ-
cantly longer-lived isomers of 115Cd were detected in
the spectra measured shortly after EOB, indicating the
negligible contribution to the 115mIn production. The
cross sections therefore can hence be considered as di-
rect independent production cross sections (Fig. 5).
An acceptable agreement with our earlier measurements
is seen. The description by the recent version of the
TALYS code is better than before.

3.5. 114mIn

The independent cross sections for formation of the
metastable state of the 114In (T1/2 = 49.51 d) are shown
in Fig. 6. The contribution of reactions on both stable
indium isotopes can be distinguished. Our new results
connect well to the earlier measurements, but give lower
values in the overlapping energy range The description

tion of 113mIn by the deuteron bombardment of indium

3.6. 113mIn

The 113mIn (99.476 min) can be produced directly via
(d,pxn) reaction and through decay of long-lived 113gSn
(115.09 d). Based on the measured 113Sn cross section
(see above), no signiﬁcant contribution of parent decay
was estimated in the ﬁrst gamma spectra used for calcu-
lation of 113mIn production cross sections (Fig. 7). Good
agreement with our earlier measurement and slight im-
provement of the description by the TALYS code were
observed.

3.7. 111In

The measured cross sections (Fig.

8) of 111gIn
(2.8047 d) are cumulative, including also production
through isomeric transition of the short-lived 111mIn
metastable state (7.7 min) and decay of 111Sn parent
(35.3 min). An acceptable agreement with our earlier
measurements and clear improvement of the TALYS de-
scription above 25 MeV were observed.

3.8. 110gIn

The independent cross sections for production of
110gIn (4.92 h) are shown in Fig. 9. No earlier exper-
imental data were found. The description by TENDL-
2014 is acceptable good, the other theoretical model
codes are not used in this case.

3.9. 109In

We obtained cross sections for 109In (4.167 h) only
at two high energy points (Fig. 10). No earlier data
were found in the literature. The only theoretical model
calculation with TENDL-2014 overestimates the exper-
imental values.

3.10. 115gCd

The new independent cross section data for the
natIn(d,x)115gCd process is are shown in Fig.
11,
together with the published and corrected data of
(T´ark´anyi et al., 2011) (see explanation of needed cor-
rection earlier) A good agreement exist between the two
datasets. All codes give results that are about one order
of magnitude oﬀ the experimental values.

4. Summary and conclusion

We report experimental cross sections for production
of 113,110Sn, 116m,115m,114m,113m,111,110g,109In and 115Cd in
the 37-50 MeV energy range. The new data are ﬁrst data
sets for all products above 40 MeV and for production
of 110Sn and 110g,109In no earlier experimental data were
found. The experimental and theoretical data and the
deduced integral yields were compared in detail in our
2011 publication. The comparison between the 2009
and 2014 versions of the TENDL library (obtained with
the most recent version of the TALYS codes) shows fur-
ther improvement for (d,xn) and some (d,pxn) reactions
but the agreement is still poor when the (d,p) reactions
plays an important role. The possible use of experimen-
tal data for production was discussed in detail in our

previous work and for 110mIn, 111In, 113mIn and 114mIn
will be included in our simultaneously submitted work
on proton induced nuclear reactions on indium. The
direct productions of indium radionuclides on indium
target will in all cases be carrier added. Therefore for
production of these medical radioisotopes via deuteron
induced reactions on indium only the production possi-
bility through generator parent isotopes should be taken
into account.
