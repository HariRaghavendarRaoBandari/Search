ABSTRACT

The discovery of the most luminous supernova ASASSN–15lh triggered a shock-
wave in the supernova community. The three possible mechanisms proposed for the
majority of other superluminous supernovae do not produce a realistic physical model
for this particular supernova. In the present study we show the limiting luminosity
available from a nickel-powered pair-instability supernova. We computed a few exotic
nickel-powered explosions with a total mass of nickel up to 1500 solar masses. We
used the hydrostatic conﬁgurations prepared with the GENEVA and MESA codes, and
the STELLA radiative-transfer code for following the explosion of these models. We
show that 1500 solar masses of radioactive nickel is needed to power a luminosity of
2 × 10 45 erg s −1. The resulting light curve is very broad and incompatible with the
shorter ASASSN–15lh time-scale. This rules out a nickel-powered origin of ASASSN–
15lh. In addition, we derive a simple peak luminosity – nickel mass relation from our
data, which may serve to estimate of nickel mass from observed peak luminosities.

1 INTRODUCTION

The supernova community is highly excited with the recent
discovery of ASASSN–15lh, which is the most luminous su-
pernova ever detected (Dong et al. 2016) among other su-
perluminous supernovae (SLSNe) (see Gal-Yam 2012, for a
review). The estimated bolometric luminosity reported is ex-
tremely high and reaches (2.2±0.2)×10 45 erg s −1. ASASSN–
15lh is classiﬁed as a Type Ic supernova, so that it requires
hydrogen and helium free models to explain it.

As ASASSN–15lh took place close to the host galaxy
centre, one of the ﬁrst possible explanations is that it is a
tidal disruption event (TDE, see Supplementary materials in
Dong et al. 2016). The detected properties of ASASSN–15lh
are diﬀerent from usual TDEs which generally possess hy-
drogen and helium (Holoien et al. 2016), although there are
at least a few TDEs with a very small amount of hydrogen
(Gezari et al. 2015; Kochanek 2016).

One of the most promising models is a rapidly rotat-
ing young highly-magnetized neutron star (i.e., a magne-
tar) powering the supernova ejecta through its dipole radi-

ation (Mazzali et al. 2006; Woosley 2010; Kasen & Bildsten
2010; Metzger et al. 2015, and references therein). In the
case of ASASSN–15lh, the magnetar requires a period of 1–
2 ms, magnetic ﬁeld of 0.3–1×10 14 G, and mass of the ejecta
of 6 M⊙ (Bersten et al. 2016), or 0.7 ms, 2.5 × 10 13 G, and
8.3 M⊙ (Sukhbold & Woosley 2016). We discuss in more de-
tail the magnetar model in Section 4.

Considering ASASSN–15lh as an interaction-powered
supernova seems irrelevant as it would require the collision of
very massive hydrogen–helium poor shells and very high en-
ergies (Chevalier & Irwin 2011; Ginzburg & Balberg 2012;
Moriya et al. 2013; Baklanov et al. 2015; Sorokina et al.
2015). Varying parameters (e.g. mass of the shell or energy)
in the interaction model allows one to construct an appro-
priate ﬁt for a given SLSN (Chatzopoulos et al. 2013). How-
ever, interaction-powered events have lower photospheric ve-
locities (several thousand km s −1).

From the stellar evolution point of view, there are a
number of ideas as to how the star may produce shells or
a dense wind, either hydrogen-free or hydrogen-rich. Ei-
ther metal-free or metal-rich very massive stars undergo
enhanced mass–loss due to pulsations (Yoon & Cantiello
2010; Fadeyev 2011; Moriya & Langer 2015). Luminous blue

variables (Humphreys & Davidson 1994) or very massive
stars with similar activity are good candidates for produc-
ing dense circumstellar environments. Yusof et al. (2013)
show that mass-loss rates reach several 10 −3 M⊙ yr −1 dur-
ing core helium burning phases of 300 – 500 M⊙ rotat-
ing and non-rotating models (eWNE phase). The super-
nova shock smashes into the surrounding medium, and in-
stead of the usual shock breakout the luminous supernova-
like event is observed. This is the promising mechanism
for Type IIn SNSLe (Moriya et al. 2014), although it re-
mains a parameter–dependent model. Mass-loss can be en-
hanced by neutrino–emission from the stellar core or waves
Meakin & Arnett (2007); Moriya (2014); Shiode & Quataert
(2014). Nevertheless, there is no evidence for interaction
signatures for ASASSN–15lh from current observations
(Milisavljevic et al. 2015).

Pulsational pair-instability supernova is another type
of
interaction-powered scenario (Woosley et al. 2007). A
star with the initial mass below pair-instability super-
nova (PISN) limit of 140 M⊙ does not explode directly1
(Woosley & Heger 2015). The star produces a sequence of
pulses of explosive nuclear burning caused by pair-creation
instability (Yoshida et al. 2016). Eventually it explodes as
a normal core-collapse supernova followed by an interaction
of supernova ejecta with the previously swept stellar shells
(Yan et al. 2015).

The last possible known realistic scenario includes the
pair-instability explosion of a very massive star at the up-
per limit of PISN mass-range (∼ 260 M⊙) (Gal-Yam et al.
2009; Gal-Yam 2012). Heger & Woosley (2002) predict that
up to 55 M⊙ of radioactive nickel is generated in this kind
of explosion and powers a luminous supernova event.

In the present study we examine the maximum luminos-
ity possible for PISNe. We also examine how much radioac-
tive nickel is needed for ASASSN–15lh, if it is considered
to be purely nickel-powered. We describe our toy models in
Section 2, discuss the light curves and derive a relation be-
tween nickel mass and resulting supernova peak luminosity
in Section 3 and 4. We conclude in Section 5.

2 INPUT MODELS AND LIGHT CURVE

MODELLING

Our main input models are the following: h200, h200Ni55,
250M, 500M, 750M, 1000M, and 1500M. We summarize
their properties important for the current study in Table 1.
Our reference model is the h200 model. Its earlier evolu-
tion was computed with the stellar evolution code GENEVA
(Ekstr¨om et al. 2012; Yusof et al. 2013). Later evolution and
the pair-instability explosion were simulated with the KE-
PLER code (Whalen et al. 2014). This PISN model produces
40 M⊙ of radioactive nickel. To inspect the limiting PISN
luminosity (model h200Ni55), we use the h200 model with
artiﬁcially increased, to 55 M⊙, amount of nickel keeping
the overall structure as in the original h200 model. We map
h200 and h200Ni55 models into the STELLA code just before
shock breakout to follow up the post-explosion evolution of

2006; Kozyreva et al. 2014).

As an input for STELLA for the other models, we create
artiﬁcial structures in hydrostatic equilibrium. The hydro-
static structures were calculated with the GENEVA and MESA2
codes. Fig. 1 presents the density structure of our input mod-
els. For their composition, we artiﬁcially set pure radioactive
nickel, leaving a shallow outermost layer consisting of oxy-
gen with a total mass not exceeding 1.7 M⊙. This is done for
the numerical stability of the STELLA code. The explosion of
these toy models in STELLA is done manually as an instant
(lasting 0.1 s) input of thermal energy spread out up to the
surface of the progenitor. The explosion energy mentioned in
Table 1 is necessary to initiate the expansion of the progen-
itor. We chose it as: 120 B (1 B or Bethe = 10 51 erg), 500 B,
550 B, 700 B, and 600 B for 250M, 500M, 750M, 1000M, and
1500M, respectively.

grangian implicit hydrodynamics code. In the present simu-
lations we use 100 frequency bins. The opacity is calculated

(1995) and Verner et al. (1996). Deposition from nickel and
cobalt decay is treated in a one-group approximation accord-
ing to Swartz et al. (1995).

3 RESULTS

We show the comparison between our reference model h200
and the model h200Ni55 in Fig. 2. The peak luminosity of
the nickel-powered light curve is expected to depend on the
mass of radioactive nickel according to the following relation
(Arnett 1979):

L peak ∼ M Ni ε(t peak) ,

(1)

where ε(t peak) is the decay function of nickel and cobalt. In
Fig. 2, the diﬀerence in the peak luminosity between models
with 40 M⊙ and 55 M⊙ of nickel is exactly what Equation 1
predicts and is equal to 0.16 dex. We chose 55 M⊙ of nickel
for the h200Ni55 model, as it represents the upper luminos-
ity limit which a PISN is able to produce (Heger & Woosley
2002). Thus, the PISN limit is: peak bolometric luminosity
equal to 2.2 × 10 44 erg s −1, or a bolometric magnitude of
−22.12 mag.

Fig. 3 shows the results for our exotic explosions of pro-
genitors with the following amounts of nickel: ∼250, 500,
750, 1000, and 1500 M⊙. Models reach the following peak
luminosities: 8.6 × 10 44, 1.3 × 10 45, 1.7 × 10 45, 1.9 × 10 45,
and 2.1×10 45 erg s −1, respectively. According to Equation 1,
619 M⊙ of nickel supports the peak of ASASSN–15lh. How-
ever, we found that our exotic explosions decline from Equa-
tion 1 displaying a weaker peak. This happens because nickel
is spread out up to the edge of the star, and a large fraction of
gamma-photons escape freely without interaction with the
ejecta material (Arnett 1979). Hence, the “eﬀective nickel
mass” is lower. Fig. 2 from Kozyreva & Blinnikov (2015) also
shows that a gradually truncated input model provides a
slightly weaker peak even without changing nickel mass.

Fig. 4 illustrates the relation between Lpeak and M Ni
based on results of the current study and other high-mass
PISN models3. By ﬁtting our data with a linear least-
squared ﬁt in Fig. 4, we obtain the following relation:

log L peak = 42.99 (±0.12) + 0.77 (±0.05) log M Ni .

The relation may be used to estimate the nickel mass
needed for a given peak bolometric
luminosity, as-
suming it is a nickel-powered light curve. In addition,

Based on our simulations, the bolometric luminosity
of ASASSN–15lh requires an explosion in which at least
1000 M⊙ of radioactive nickel is produced. It is obvious that
there are no known stellar explosions which are capable of
generating this huge nickel mass. We discuss a few aspects
of producing high nickel mass in Section 4.

A high fraction of nickel results not only in the high
peak luminosity, but also in slow evolution of a light
curve. The light curve for the 1500M model lasts about
1000 d above 10 43 erg s −1. This fact resembles the well-
known Pskovskii–Phillips relation for SN Ia (Pskovskii 1977;
Phillips 1993), i.e., higher mass of nickel supports brighter
peak and broader light curve.

4 DISCUSSION

In this section we discuss the maximum luminosity for
PISN explosions. The grid of models from Heger & Woosley
(2002) shows the results of the simulation of non-rotating
zero-metallicity models in the helium-core mass range be-
tween 65 M⊙ and 135 M⊙. The initial corresponding main-
sequence star mass ranges from 140 M⊙ to 260 M⊙. How-
ever, the evolutionary parameter space greatly exceeds this
grid of very massive stars (Woosley & Heger 2015).

There is no diﬃculty to produce stars as massive
as a thousand solar masses, although they were not ob-
served yet (Wagoner 1969; Abel et al. 2002; Yungelson et al.
2008; Vanbeveren et al. 2009; Hosokawa & Omukai 2009;
Hosokawa et al. 2013). Such large stellar objects may be
formed in a two-step process through accretion on the al-
ready formed proto-star (Kuiper et al. 2011). However, the
uncertainty in mass-loss rates for very massive stars implies
large uncertainties in their evolution (Vink 2015).

The crucial aspect in the pair-instability explosion is
the balance between binding energy of the star and nuclear
energy released in the explosive oxygen and silicon burning.
Binding energy is proportional to its gravitational energy
(with a factor of γ − 4
3 ), i.e. its mass. For higher massive ob-
jects, density is lower, because of radiation-dominated pres-
sure, which leads to larger radii (Fig. 1 in this Letter, and
Wagoner 1969). A higher mass object is more “spongy”, and
its speciﬁc binding energy (ε/M ) is lower (see Table 3 in
Bisnovatyi-Kogan & Kazhdan 1967), therefore, it is easy to
unbind such systems. Roughly, half of the mass of the star
is left after wind mass-loss, and it becomes a carbon-oxygen
core (Bond et al. 1982). Once the carbon-oxygen core under-
goes the pair-creation instability, oxygen burns and provides
the essential fraction of explosive energy, which disrupts the
star. The released nuclear energy then depends linearly on
the mass of the carbon-oxygen core. Hence, the upper-mass
boundary for the pair-instability explosion might be higher

than 260 M⊙. It is, however, not expected to reach anywhere
near a thousand solar masses of radioactive nickel.

Rotation plays a role in reducing the gravitational force,
but not drastically (Fricke 1974). If a carbon-oxygen core
retains large angular momentum (Glatzel et al. 1985), the
PISN upper-mass boundary may slightly increase.

As we mention in Section 1,

An object as massive as 500–1000 M⊙ or higher is a
subject of general relativity. According to general relativis-
tic eﬀects, these supermassive objects in general collapse
into black holes, and nothing prevents contraction. How-
ever, some supermassive star models in a narrow mass-range
around 55,000 M⊙ explode (see studies by Fricke (1973),
Fuller et al. (1986), Johnson et al. (2013), Whalen et al.
(2013a), Whalen et al. (2013b), and Chen et al. (2014)
which include general relativity), but they do not produce
large nickel masses. Adding these factors together cannot
help in producing 1000 M⊙ of nickel. Therefore, we conclude
that ASASSN–15lh is clearly not a pair-instability explosion.
if consider a magnetar
origin for ASASSN–15lh, the magnetar requires a period
of 1–2 ms, magnetic ﬁeld of 0.3–1×10 14 G, and mass of
the ejecta of 6 M⊙ (Bersten et al. 2016), or 0.7 ms, 2.5 ×
10 13 G, and 8.3 M⊙ (Sukhbold & Woosley 2016). However,
it is not very clear whether a magnetar may store such
a high rotational energy (3 × 10 52 erg) and strong mag-
netic ﬁeld (Metzger et al. 2015). Independent detailed sim-
ulations show that if a magnetar powers a supernova ejecta,
the resulting event is not luminous (Badjin et al. in prepa-
ration). An ambiguous aspect is how the magnetic dipole
radiation (a Poynting ﬂux) is converted into thermal en-
ergy of the ejecta, as high-energy photons produce electron-
positron pairs and, in turn, high gamma-ray opacity (see
Kasen et al. 2015, for discussion). This cascading process
supplies an uncertainty to the thermalization timescale and
thermalization eﬃciency, and prevents a high photon ﬂux,
hence, the production of a luminous supernova. Neverthe-
less, it may be that independent of our understanding of
the microphysics, dipole radiation indeed is converted into
ejecta thermal energy, and the magnetar-powered mecha-
nism remains the best candidate for such luminous events.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In the present study we carried out post-explosion evolu-
tion of a PISN with a total mass of nickel equal to 55 M⊙.
55 M⊙ of nickel is roughly the upper published limit avail-
able in a pair-instability explosion. The limiting bolometric
luminosity of a PISN corresponds to 2.2 × 10 44 erg s −1, i.e.,
–22.12 mag. We show that the peak luminosity of ASASSN–
15lh signiﬁcantly exceeds the upper threshold available for
PISN explosions, therefore, it is deﬁnitely not a PISN.

On top of that we carried out simulations of a grid of
exotic explosions with total mass of nickel: 250, 500, 750,
1000, and 1500 M⊙. In the assumption of purely nickel-
powered light curves the peak luminosity of 2 × 10 45 erg s −1
requires at least 1000 M⊙ of nickel. However, the resulting
light curve is too broad (1000 d) and incompatible with the
shorter time-scale of ASASSN–15lh.

The late-time observations of ASASSN–15lh will shed
light on the origin of this unique event. One of the pos-
sibilities is that this is a tidal disruption event in which a

MNRAS 000, 1–5 (2016)

companion star ﬁrstly loses entirely its hydrogen and helium
layers at an earlier time and then accretes on to a massive
black hole. Another possible scenario includes a fast rotat-
ing highly-magnetized neutron star, although the required
rotation and magnetic ﬁelds are high.
