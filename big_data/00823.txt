ABSTRACT

The population of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is composed by quiescent SMBHs, such as those seen in local galaxies including
the Milky Way’s, and active ones, resulting in quasars and active galactic nuclei. Outside our neighbourhood, all the information we
have on SMBHs is derived from quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGN), giving us a partial view. We study the evolution of the
supermassive black hole population, total and active, by the continuity equation, backwards in time from z = 0 to z = 4. Type–1
and type–2 AGN are diﬀerentiated in the model on the basis of the Eddington ratio distribution, chosen on the basis of observational
estimates. The duty cycle is obtained by matching the luminosity function of quasars, and the average radiative eﬃciency is the
only free parameter in the model. For higher radiative eﬃciencies (& 0.07) a large fraction of the SMBH population, most of them
quiescent, must already be in place by z = 4. For lower radiative eﬃciencies (∼ 0.05), the duty cycle increases with the redshift
and the SMBH population evolves dramatically since z = 4. The mass function of active SMBHs does not depend on the choice of
the radiative eﬃciency or of the local SMBH mass function, but it is mainly determined by the quasar luminosity function, once the
Eddington ratio distribution is ﬁxed. Only a direct measurement of the total BHMF at redshifts z & 2 could break these degeneracies
giving important constraints on the average radiative eﬃciency. Focusing on type–1 AGN, for which observational estimates of the
mass function and Eddington ratio distribution exist at various redshift, models with lower radiative eﬃciencies reproduce better the
high–mass end of the mass function at high-z, but they tend to over-predict it at low-z, and vice-versa for models with higher radiative
eﬃciencies.

Key words. Galaxies: active – Galaxies: evolution – Galaxies: luminosity function, mass function – quasars: supermassive black
holes.

1. Introduction

The population of supermassive black hole (SMBHs) we de-
tect at the centre of local galaxies (e.g., Kormendy & Richstone
1995) has been built over long cosmic times, as traced, for
instance, by the luminosity function of active galactic nuclei
(AGN) and quasars. Local SMBHs represent the relics of the
young population observed at earlier cosmic epochs.

While at z = 0, for at least several tens of galaxies, we can
measure the SMBH mass (for a review of the masses and the
measurement techniques, see Kormendy & Ho 2013), this is im-
possible at higher redshift, where we can only obtain estimates
of SMBH masses through indirect methods. In fact, as soon as
we move away from the local Universe, we can only observe ac-
tive SMBHs, powering AGN and quasars, giving us only a partial
view of the full population. For each AGN there may be several
dormant SMBHs that we cannot identify as such.
There are diﬀerent ways of estimating,

theoretically,
the cosmic evolution of
the SMBH population. Analyti-
cal models, for instance, can use the continuity equation
(see, e.g., Cavaliere et al. 1971; Small & Blandford 1992;
Yu & Tremaine 2002; Marconi et al. 2004; Merloni & Heinz
2008; Shankar et al. 2013), hinging on the assumption that the
mass function of SMBH at one time can be evolved in time,

backwards or forwards, to predict the mass function at an earlier
or later time, in dependence of the distribution of accretion rates.
The strongest assumption in this kind of models is that SMBHs
grow primarily by gas accretion in luminous phases, and that lu-
minosity function of AGN can be used as a constraint. Another
option is to convolve the dark matter halo mass function and/or
merger rate with a relation between SMBH and halo, and track
the SMBHs by assuming that the link with the properties of dark
matter halos is suﬃcient to describe the main properties of the
SMBH population (e.g., Haiman & Loeb 1998; Wyithe & Loeb
2002, 2003).

Alternatively, one can use semi-analytical models, where
the population of SMBHs
is evolved jointly with the
dark matter halos and galaxies hosting them, using an-
alytical prescription to describe the main physical pro-
cesses such as gas cooling, star
formation rate, and ac-
cretion on the SMBHs (e.g., Kauﬀmann & Haehnelt 2000;
Cattaneo 2001; Volonteri et al. 2003; Monaco et al. 2000;
Haehnelt & Kauﬀmann 2000; Cattaneo et al. 2005; Croton et al.
2006; Bower et al. 2006; Monaco et al. 2007; Fontanot et al.
2011; Hirschmann et al. 2012). The strongest assumptions in this
case is that the properties of dark matter halos determine those

Hirschmann et al. 2014; Sijacki et al. 2015; Volonteri et al.
2016), where the advantage is that
the cosmological envi-
ronment is followed faithfully in the non-linear regime, and
the growth of galaxies through mergers and gas accretion is
naturally taken into account. However, small-scale baryonic
physics is included using analytical approximations as in
the case of semi-analytical models, and such simulations are
computationally expensive, barring the possibility of exploring
a large parameter space, as is instead possible using analytical
or semi-analytical techniques.

This paper is the ﬁrst in a series of two, where we ﬁrst de-
velop a framework, based on the continuity equation, to follow
the cosmic evolution of SMBHs (this paper), and we then apply
this framework to model the AGN luminosity function at radio
wavelengths, where little dedicated work has been done (e.g.,
Haiman et al. 2004; Shankar et al. 2010).

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we recall
the main properties of the continuity equation and its implemen-
tation. In Section 3 we describe methodology and assumptions.
In Section 4 we present the main results and their discussion,
and, ﬁnally, in Section 5 we summarize our conclusions.

2. SMBH evolution via continuity equation

The evolution of the SMBH population through time is typically
described by a continuity equation (see, e.g., Cavaliere et al.
1971;
2002;
Marconi et al. 2004; Merloni & Heinz 2008; Shankar et al.
2013):

where ΦBH(M, t)1 is the black hole mass function (BHMF), de-
ﬁned as the number of SMBHs per comoving volume with mass
in the logarithmic interval log(M), log(M) + ∆ log(M); h ˙Mi is
the average accretion rate of SMBHs of mass M at time t. Un-
der the assumption that SMBHs grow during phases of AGN
activity, the growth rate is the result of the mass that falls into

luminosity is L = ǫ ˙Maccc2, where ǫ is the radiative eﬃciency of
the accretion ﬂow. The growth rate of a SMBH is thus given by
˙M = (1 − ǫ) ˙Macc. Consequently, the bolometric luminosity can
be related to the mass accretion rate by

Although individual SMBHs turn on and oﬀ, the mass func-
tion evolution depends only on the average accretion rate of all
SMBHs, active and inactive. In term of the Eddington ratio – de-
ﬁned as λ ≡ L/LEdd with the Eddington luminosity LEdd = ℓM

where now ǫ has to be considered as the average value for
SMBHs of mass M at time t. The average Eddington ratio hλi
is

where P(λ|M, t) is the probability for a SMBH of mass M to
accrete at the Eddington ratio λ at time t (it is per unit of log λ

and it is normalized to unity, i.e. R d log λ P(λ|M, t) = 1).

The average accretion rate depends also on the duty cycle,
U(M, t), i.e. on the fraction of SMBHs of mass M that are active
at time t. By the deﬁnition of duty cycle, we can introduce the
mass function of active SMBHs (through the paper, this will be
also called as the AGN MF):

ΦAGN(M, t) = ΦBH(M, t) U(M, t) .

In Eq. 1 the contribution from black hole mergers has not
been included. The relevance of this term is quite unknown
and it is diﬃcult to evaluate. Shankar et al. (2013) attempted
to estimate this eﬀect using the SMBH merger rate predicted
by hierarchical models of structure formation. They found that
mergeres have limited eﬀects at z > 2, but they might be rele-
vant on the local mass function increasing the space density of
high–mass SMBHs (see also the discussion in Merloni & Heinz
2008). Aversa et al. (2015) agree with these conclusions. They
found that mergers increase moderately the space densities of
SMBHs with M >∼ 109 M⊙ at low redshifts, but that the ef-
fect is probably smaller than the current uncertainties on the lo-
cal black hole mass function (BHMF). Numerical simulations
by Volonteri et al. (2005); Berti & Volonteri (2008) also veriﬁed
that mass accretion dominates over mergers in determining the
mass growth and spin distribution of black holes. Because of the
large uncertainties in both merging rates of galaxies and physical
processes involved in black hole mergers, we neglect this contri-
bution in the following analysis. This is a standard assumption
in most of the studies that employ the continuity equation.

3. Method

Here below we describe in detail the method we employ to solve
the continuity equation (Eq. 6) and the main ingredients and as-
sumptions of the model. We use as boundary condition the local
BHMF and we integrate the equation backwards in time up to
redshift z = 4. The model requires the simultaneous knowledge
of the Eddington ratio distribution P(λ|M, z), the duty cycle and
the radiative eﬃciency of SMBHs. The Eddington ratio distribu-
tion is an input of the model and it is chosen on the basis of ob-
servational constraints on type–1 and type–2 AGN. In particular,
we refer to estimates from Kelly & Shen (2013) and Aird et al.
(2012). For the duty cycle we adopt a parametric function of
redshift and SMBH mass, and the parameters are determined
from the best–ﬁt of the observational quasar luminosity func-
tions from Hopkins et al. (2007). The radiative eﬃciency ǫ is a
free parameter of the model. We study solutions of the continuity
equation for diﬀerent values of the average radiative eﬃciency,
assuming it to be independent of time and SMBH mass.

3.1. LocalSMBHmassfunction

Marco Tucci and Marta Volonteri: SMBH and AGN evolution

Several works estimated the local BHMF using the observed em-
pirical scaling relations between SMBH mass and host galaxy
spheroidal properties, such as luminosity, stellar velocity disper-
sion and bulge mass (see Shankar et al. 2009; Kormendy & Ho
2013, for a review). Shankar et al. (2009) present a compila-
tion of local BHMF determinations based on a variety of meth-
ods, scaling relations, and data sets. The spread in the esti-
mates is shown in Fig. 1 (the blue shaded area). These estimates
give a local mass density of SMBHs in the range ρBH = 3.2–
5.4 × 105 M⊙Mpc−3. Moreover, Vika et al. (2009) derive the lo-
cal BHMF for a large sample of galaxies from the Millennium
Galaxy Catalogue using the empirical black hole mass–bulge lu-
minosity relation of Graham (2007). Li et al. (2011) use lumi-
nosity and stellar mass functions of ﬁeld galaxies to constrain
the masses of their spheroids, and then compute SMBH mass
through the empirical correlation between SMBH and spheroid
mass (Häring & Rix 2004). Despite the diﬀerent methods, all
these derived local BHMFs are well consistent with each other
(see Fig. 1).

However, uncertainties on the actual local BHMF do remain.
The main issue is related to the scaling relationships used for the
SMBH mass determination. Recently, Kormendy & Ho (2013)
have updated the calibration between the SMBH mass and the
luminosity, mass, or velocity dispersion of the bulge component
of the host galaxy in the local universe. This led to an upward
revision by a factor of ∼ 2–3 of SMBH masses that were previ-
ously computed. Assuming the new relation of Kormendy & Ho
(2013), Ueda et al. (2014) updated the local mass function of
Li et al. (2011) ﬁnding a larger MF at all masses. Moreover,
Shankar (2013) derived the local BHMF from the assumption
that all local galaxies follow the revised early-type MBH–σ rela-
tion from McConnell & Ma (2013). In this case the revised esti-
mates give a signiﬁcantly larger local MF at the highest masses
(>∼ 109 M⊙) with respect to previous computations (see Fig. 1).

Following Merloni & Heinz (2008) we adopt an analytic ex-
pression for the local BHMF, given by the convolution of a
Schechter function with a Gaussian scatter. The Schechter func-
tion has the following parametrization:

1+α

M

M⋆!

exp 1 −

ΨM = φ⋆  M
M⋆!
with φ⋆ = 10−3, log M⋆ = 8.4 and α = −1.19. These parameters
are chosen in order to give a mass function that is coincident with
the central value within the uncertainty range of Shankar et al.
(2009) if a Gaussian scatter of 0.3 dex is used.

(7)

In the following analysis, we will use a local BHMF com-
puted with a Gaussian scatter of 0.3 and 0.5 dex. In this way,
we can take into account the current uncertainties on the lo-
cal BHMF at the highest masses. Increasing the scatter from
0.3 to 0.5 dex, the mass function becomes compatible with es-
timates of Shankar (2013): the number density of SMBHs is
larger by a factor ∼ 2 at M ∼ 109 M⊙, and by an order of
magnitude at M ∼ 6 × 109 M⊙. Changing the scatter has how-
ever a moderate impact on the local SMBH mass density: ρBH =
4.3 (6.6) × 105 M⊙ Mpc−3 for a Gaussian scatter of 0.3 (0.5) dex.

3.2. Radiativeefﬁciency

The average radiative eﬃciency ǫ of quasars is commonly esti-
mated based on the classical “Soltan argument” (Soltan 1982),
according to which the local mass budget of black holes in galac-
tic nuclei should be accounted for by integrating the overall

energy density released by AGN, with an appropriate mass-to-
energy conversion eﬃciency. Several studies, assuming a ﬁxed
radiative eﬃciency over black hole mass and redshift, concluded
that ǫ has to be within the range 0.05–0.40 to explain the
relic population (e.g., Yu & Tremaine 2002; Elvis et al. 2002;
Marconi et al. 2004; Shankar et al. 2009; Li et al. 2012). The
same range of values is also predicted by the standard accre-
tion disc theory (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), from ǫ = 0.054 for
a non–rotating SMBH to ǫ = 0.42 for a SMBH with maximal
spin.

Individual AGN can also be used to deduce the absolute ac-
cretion rate and the radiative eﬃciency by ﬁtting observed op-
tical spectra with the thin accretion disk model (Davis & Laor
2011; Wu et al. 2013). Average values of ǫ ≈ 0.1 are derived,
roughly consistent with estimates based on the Soltan argument.

It is still debated if the radiative eﬃciency depends on SMBH
mass and redshift. Theoretical arguments have suggested that
the radiative eﬃciency may increase with the SMBH mass
(e.g. Volonteri et al. 2007; Fanidakis et al. 2011). Davis & Laor
(2011) directly determined the radiative eﬃciency for 80 quasars
and found a strong correlation with the SMBH mass. On the
other hand, Wu et al. (2013) showed that the SDSS quasar data
are consistent with no intrinsic correlation with the SMBH mass
and no redshift evolution. They also demonstrated that the appar-
ent correlation ǫ–M can be produced by selection eﬀects and bias
induced by mass estimates (see also Raimundo et al. 2012). Re-
sults based on Soltan’s argument are also contrasting: Cao & Li
(2008); Wang et al. (2009); Li et al. (2012) are in favour of a
mass and redshift dependence, while Cao (2010); Shankar et al.
(2013) reach opposite conclusions. For semplicity, in our analy-
sis we will assume ǫ to be a constant.

3.3. Activesupermassiveblackholes

Throughout the paper, we deﬁne an active SMBH (or, equiv-
alently, an AGN) if the Eddington ratio is λ ≥ λcut = 10−4.
At lower Eddington ratio SMBHs are supposed to be quies-
cent. This choice is somewhat arbitrary if the Eddington ratio
distribution is broad and extends to λ < 10−4 as indicated by
diﬀerent observations (e.g., Panessa et al. 2006; Hopkins et al.
2006; Babi´c et al. 2007). We choose this λcut because SMBHs
with smaller Eddington ratio do not give relevant contributions
to the bolometric luminosity function, at least in the luminosity
range we consider, i.e. 1043–1048 erg s−1. In fact, if λ < 10−4
only SMBHs with mass M >∼ 109 M⊙ have luminosity L ≥
1043 erg s−1. The number density of SMBHs exponentially de-
clines at these masses, i.e. much faster than the power–law in-
crease of the Eddington ratio distribution at low λ as seen, e.g.,
by Aird et al. (2012).

The duty cycle is clearly sensitive to the Eddington ratio limit
deﬁning an active SMBH. A lower threshold obviously increases
the fraction of active SMBHs, but, in principle, the BHMF de-
termined by the continuity equation should be independent of it.
However, the evolution of the BHMF is aﬀected by λcut through
the average accretion rate that is proportional to the product of
the duty cycle and hλi (see Eq. 3). As shown in Appendix A, λcut
seems to be not very relevant for the mass function of both total
and active SMBHs. Moreover, the choice of λcut is still less im-
portant when we compare the model predictions with estimates
from observational samples in which quasars are selected above
a given ﬂux limit and that are sensitive only to a speciﬁc range
of Eddington ratios.

An alternative view, considered e.g. by Merloni & Heinz
(2008), assumes that every SMBH is active at some level, and
there is no distinction between SMBHs and AGN. By deﬁni-
tion, the duty cycle is then equal to 1. However, this implies the
knowledge of the Eddington ratio distribution at very low accre-
tion rates, λ ≪ 10−4, which are scarcely accessible to observa-
tions.

3.4. Eddingtonratiodistribution

There are observational evidences that the Eddington ratio dis-
tribution is diﬀerent for type–1 (or unobscured) and type–2 (or
obscured) AGN. Trump et al. (2011) proposed two distinct dis-
tributions of Eddington ratios for X-ray-selected AGN, corre-
sponding to two diﬀerent modes of accretion. They found that, in
general, broad emission lines are present only at high accretion
rates (λ > 10−2). According to this study, unobscured AGN (and
possibly some obscured narrow–line AGN) should be fed by a
thin accretion disk containing the broad-line region and some
obscuring material. On the other hand, narrow–line or lineless
AGN at λ < 10−2 may be powered by a geometrically thick,
radiatively ineﬃcient accretion ﬂow. Lusso et al. (2012) studied
the Eddington ratio distribution for a X–ray sample of type–1
and type–2 AGN covering redshifts z ≤ 2. The Eddington ratio
distribution for type–1 AGN was found to be more consistent
with a Gaussian than a power law. For type–2 AGN results are
less clear, with some evidence for a power–law distribution only
at low redshifts. The presence of two distinct regimes for the
SMBH growth was also pointed out by Kauﬀmann & Heckman
(2009). They analyzed the observed distribution of Eddington
ratios for a sample of nearby SDSS galaxies. They found that
galaxies with signiﬁcant star formation are characterized by a
broad log–normal distribution of accretion rates peaked at a few
percent of the Eddington limit. On the contrary, galaxies with

Article number, page 4 of 15

old central stellar populations are characterized by a power–law
distribution function of Eddington ratios.

The Eddington ratio distribution for type–1 AGN was accu-
rately determined by Shen & Kelly (2012); Kelly & Shen (2013)
in a large redshift range, from 0.3–5. They jointly estimated the
BHMF and the Eddington ratio distribution function (ERDF) for
a sample of ∼ 58, 000 type–1 quasars from the SDSS. They em-
ployed a Bayesian technique to deal with selection eﬀects and
the statistical scatter between true SMBH masses and virial mass
estimates. In particular, Kelly & Shen (2013) modelled the joint
bivariate distribution of SMBH mass and Eddington ratio as a
superposition of 2D log–normal functions. Their results on the
ERDF at diﬀerent redshift bins show that the comoving number
densities of type–1 quasars increase toward lower Eddington ra-
tio, a trend that continues beyond the incompleteness limit. The
only exceptions are the z = 3.75 and z = 4.25 bins, which dis-
play evidence for a peak at λ ≈ 0.3. The distribution of λ are rel-
atively independent of the black hole mass at both low (z <∼ 0.6)
and high (z >∼ 3.2) redshift, while at intermediate redshifts they
found larger Eddington ratios moving from M ∼ 5 × 108 M⊙ to
M ∼ 5 × 109 M⊙. However, as they commented, the mass de-
pendence could not be real but be driven by systematic eﬀects
related to the change of the mass estimator in these redshift bins.
Concerning type–2 AGN, diﬀerent independent works agree
that the Eddington ratio distribution has a power law behavior.
Hopkins & Hernquist (2009) showed that the observed distri-
butions from the complete sample of SDSS galaxies selected
by Heckman et al. (2004); Yu et al. (2005) are well ﬁtted by a
Schecter function with a power law slope of ∼ −0.6, almost in-
dependent of the mass range, and a cut–oﬀ at λ ∼ 1. Aird et al.
(2012) estimated the distribution of the speciﬁc accretion rate –
the rate of black hole growth relative to the stellar mass of the
host galaxy – for a large sample of obscured X–ray AGN at red-
shift 0.2 < z < 1.0. They found that the distribution is indepen-
dent of the stellar mass of the host galaxy and can be described
by a power law with constant slope ≃ −0.65 throughout the spe-
ciﬁc accretion rate (10−4–1) and redshift range. These results can
be interpreted in terms of Eddington ratio assuming a direct pro-
portionality between the mass of the central SMBH and the stel-
lar mass of the host galaxy (they consider MBH ≈ 0.002M⋆).
Similar results were also obtained by Bongiorno et al. (2012)
from a X–ray and optically selected sample of AGN, but with
a slightly steeper power–law index (≈ −1).

Based on these observational ﬁndings, we model separately
the Eddington ratio distribution, P(λ), for type–1 and type–2
AGN. In both cases we assume distributions independent of the
SMBH mass. According to our deﬁnition of active SMBHs, P(λ)
is considered only for λ ≥ 10−4.

For type–1 AGN we use a log–normal distribution,

P1(λ, z) =

1

2πσ(z)λ

e−[ln λ−ln λc(z)]2/2σ2(z) ,

(8)

where the central value λc(z) and the dispersion σ(z) of the dis-
tribution are determined by ﬁtting the shape of the ERDFs from
Kelly & Shen (2013) in the diﬀerent redshift bins and by inter-
polating the results with a linear function (see Fig. 2). We ﬁnd

log λc(z) = max[−1.9 + 0.45z, log(0.03)]

σ(z)

= max(1.03 − 0.15z, 0.6) .

For type–2 AGN we use a power–law distribution with an

exponential cut–oﬀ at super–Eddington luminosities,

P2(λ, z) = a2(z) λαλ(z)e−λ/λ0 ,

(9)

Marco Tucci and Marta Volonteri: SMBH and AGN evolution

where λ0 = 1.5 (or 2.5 when ǫ ≥ 0.1). The distribution is nor-
malized to unity by the factor a2. The slope of the power law is
taken to be

αλ = ( −0.6

−0.6/(0.4 + z)

z ≤ 0.6
z > 0.6

(10)

At
low redshifts this is in agreement with ﬁndings from
Hopkins & Hernquist (2009); Kauﬀmann & Heckman (2009);
Aird et al. (2012). At redshifts z >∼ 1 there are no observational
constraints on the Eddington ratio distribution for type–2 AGN.
Here we introduce a redshift dependence in αλ that makes the
distribution ﬂatter and ﬂatter at high redshifts. As discussed in
Appendix A, keeping a constant slope of −0.6 would give a
BHMF that does not signiﬁcantly evolve over time at z >∼ 0.5
at low and intermediate masses, in contrast with general expec-
tations. For example, Fig. 3 shows the evolution of the BHMF
computed from the continuity equation, assuming U(M, t) = 1
and a power–law Eddington ratio distribution with constant slope
αλ = −0.6 and −0.3. Even with a duty cycle equal to 1, most
of SMBHs with M < 108 M⊙ should be already formed before
z = 4 if αλ = −0.6. To be noted the large diﬀerence in the mass
function evolution between the two values of αλ.

As explained in Hopkins & Hernquist (2009), given the
quasar luminosity function, the Eddington ratio distribution can
be directly translated into a quasar lifetime or light curve model.
A log–normal distribution, as we use for type–1 AGN, is typi-
cally associated to “light bulb” models, in which quasars grow
at ﬁxed Eddington ratio with an instantaneous or exponential lu-
minosity decay. A truncated power–law Eddington distribution
arises instead if the quasar luminosity undergoes a power–law
decay with time. Our assumptions on P(λ) imply therefore a dif-
ferent accretion model for type–1 and type–2 AGN.

The Eddington ratio distribution for all the active AGN is
thus the sum of the distributions for type–1 and type–2 quasars
weighted by the relative abundance of the two populations. The
fraction of obscured/unobscured AGN have been largely in-
vestigated in literature, giving evidence of an anti–correlation
with nuclear luminosity (e.g., Ueda et al. 2003; Hasinger 2008;
Merloni et al. 2014; Ueda et al. 2014). Several works have also
reported evidence of positive evolution of the fraction of ob-
scured AGN with increasing redshift (La Franca et al. 2005;
Hasinger 2008; Iwasawa et al. 2012; Merloni et al. 2014). In the
following analysis we adopt the parametrization provided by
Ueda et al. (2014) for the fraction of obscured AGN, i.e. for
AGN with an intrinsic absorption NH ≥ 1022 cm−2. This is based
on a combined sample of X–ray surveys of various depth, width
and energy bands. They provided the fraction of obscured AGN,
fobs, as a function of X–ray luminosity and redshift.

Because the relative abundance of type–1 and type–2 AGN
depends on the luminosity, the total Eddington ratio distribution
will depend on the SMBH mass too and will take the form:

P(λ|M, z) = an(M, z)(cid:20) funo(L, z)P1(λ, z)+ fobs(L, z) P2(λ, z)(cid:21) , (11)

where funo(L, z) = 1− fobs(L, z) is the fraction of type–1 AGN and
fobs is in terms of the bolometric luminosity2. The factor an(M) is
required by the normalization conditionR d log λ P(λ|M, z) = 1.
Fig. 2 shows P(λ) for M = 108 M⊙ at diﬀerent redshifts. At
low redshift, most of SMBHs, including type–1 AGN, accrete
at low rates, λ ≪ 0.1. Increasing the redshift, the distribution

2 X–ray luminosities are converted to bolometric luminosities through
the bolometric corrections provided by Marconi et al. (2004).

Fig. 2. Eddington ratio distribution given by Eq .11 for SMBHs of mass
M = 108 M⊙ at diﬀerent redshifts (black solid lines; dotted lines are for
type–1 AGN and dashed lines for type–2 AGN). The Eddington ratio
distributions from Kelly & Shen (2013) with an arbritary normalization
are also shown (red lines): the two lines give the uncertainty in their
estimates (at 68% of probability); dotted lines denote the regions below
the 10% completeness for the ﬂux–limited SDSS sample.

for type–2 AGN becomes ﬂatter, while for type–1 AGN sharper
and peaked at higher λ. At z >∼ 2 basically all the type–1 AGN
and about 30–50% of the total active population have λ > 0.01.
The fraction of AGN with L ∼ LEdd becomes also relevant. The
dependence of the distribution on the SMBH mass is modest,
and it is related only to the increasing fraction of type–1 AGN
with M.

Given the probability distribution, it is easy to compute the
average Eddington ratio as a function of black hole mass and
redshift (Fig. 4). We ﬁnd that it is roughly 10−2 at z < 1 and then
steadly increases with redshift up to 0.1–0.3 between z =3–4. As
expected, there is only a slight dependence on the SMBH mass.

3.5. Dutycycle

As previously discussed, we deﬁne the duty cycle U(M, z) as the
fraction of SMBHs of mass M that are active at redshift z, or,
in other terms, as the fraction of SMBHs accreting at λ ≥ 10−4.
Alternatively, the duty cycle of a SMBH can be also viewed as
the lifetime that quasars of a given mass pass radiating at a lumi-
nosity larger than a certain value L (e.g., Hopkins & Hernquist
2009). This is a key term to solve the continuity equation and it
is also an important prediction of the model.

Merloni & Heinz (2008) deﬁned the average growth time of
a SMBH as the ratio M/h ˙Mi. It measures the time it would take
a SMBH of mass M to double its mass if accreting at a rate h ˙Mi.
In Fig. 4 we plot the value of the duty cycle needed to have a
growth time equal to the age of the Universe at that redshift.
This indicates the “minimum” duty cycle above which SMBHs
(of mass M at time t) are, on average, actively growing or, in
other terms, the BHMF is signiﬁcantly evolving. We can see that

Fig. 3. SMBH mass function at redshifts 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 (from top
to bottom), assuming U(M, z) = 1 and a power–law distribution for the
Eddington ratio with a constant slope αλ = −0.6 (upper panel) and −0.3
(lower panel).

phases of major growth/evolution require duty cycles close to 1
at low redshifts and, in any case, larger than 0.1.

From the observational point of view, the duty cycle of
SMBHs is diﬃcult to estimate because it requires the simulta-
neous knowledge of the SMBH and AGN mass function. If we
assume that all massive galaxies contain a SMBH, then the frac-
tion of active galaxies can be used as an observable proxy for
black hole duty cycles. However, even in this way, the “mea-
sured” duty cycle will depend on the luminosity or Eddington
ratio threshold of the speciﬁc observational sample.

Our approach is to assume a parametric function for the duty

cycle, which is described by a double power law:

U(M, z) = min 

A(z)

(M/M0)αl(z) + (M/M0)αk(z) , 1! .

(12)

We have imposed the physical condition that U(M, z) ≤ 1, and
we ﬁx M0 = 107.5 M⊙ at all redshifts. The redshift evolution of
the duty cycle parameters is described by cubic polynomials,

X(z) = aX + bX z + cX z2 + dX z3 with X = A, αl, αk ,

(13)

giving a total of 12 parameters for the duty cycle. These param-
eters are constrained by the condition that, at each redshift bin,
the bolometric luminosity function computed by

Φ(L, z) = Z d log λ P(λ|M, z) U(M, z) ΦBH(M, z)

(14)

has to match the observational quasar luminosity function (QLF)
estimated by Hopkins et al. (2007). They combined a large set of
measurements from the optical, soft and hard X–ray, and near–
and mid–IR bands to determine the bolometric QLF in the red-
shift interval z = 0–6. Then, they ﬁt the observational QLF by
a double power law in each redshift bins. The evolution in red-
shift of the best–ﬁt parameters are also parametrized in order to

Fig. 4. Redshift evolution of the average Eddington ratio (black lines),
and of the duty cycle required in order to have a growth time equal to
the age of the Universe (red curves). The duty cycle is computed for
ǫ = 0.1 (upper lines) and 0.05 (lower lines). We have considered three
SMBH masses: 106 (dotted line), 108 (solid line) and 1010 M⊙ (dashed
line).

provide analytical formulas to compute the QLF in a generic red-
shift between 0 and 6. We use the results for the reference model,
indicated as “full” in Table 3 of Hopkins et al. (2007). Based on
the uncertainties of the best–ﬁt parameters, we estimate the un-
certainty on the QLF by a Montecarlo technique (see the shaded
areas in Fig. 5).

Given the duty cycle (i.e., chosen a set of the 12 parameters),
the continuity equation is solved recursively imposing the local
SMBH mass function as initial condition and going backwards
in time from redshift 0 to 4. At each timestep, we use the AGN
MF derived from the previous timesteps to compute the update
BHMF. The bolometric QLF is ﬁnally computed from Eq. 14.
We employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to
ﬁnd the parameters of the duty cycle that best ﬁt the QLF of
Hopkins et al. (2007) in the redshift range 0–4.

As a consistency test, we have developed another method
to determine the duty cycle parameters of Eq. 12 that does not
rely on any functional form for the redshift dependence of the
parameters. In this case, the duty cycle is assumed to be constant
in small redshift intervals of ∆z = 0.1. In each redshift bin, zi, the
3 free parameters of U(M, t) (i.e., A, αl and αk) are determined by
ﬁnding the best ﬁt to the observational QLF at z = zi−1 + ∆z/2. In
general, the two methods provide consistent results, although the
ﬁrst one is able to provide better ﬁts to the QLF at high redshifts,
especially when the BHMF is strongly evolving with time (i.e.,
for low values of the radiative eﬃciency).

4. Results

In this section we present the results of the model in term of
BHMF, duty cycle and AGN MF (Fig. 6). The average radiative
eﬃciency of SMBHs is a free parameter and we have solved
the continuity equation for diﬀerent values of ǫ. In addition, we

Marco Tucci and Marta Volonteri: SMBH and AGN evolution

have considered two diﬀerent inputs of the local mass function,
obtained, i.e., by convolving the Schechter function in Eq. 7 with
a Gaussian scatter of 0.3 (LMF03) and 0.5 dex (LMF05).

Three models are described in detail: with ǫ = 0.05 and 0.07,
and the LMF05 local BHMF; with ǫ = 0.1 and the LMF03 lo-
cal BHMF. They provide the best ﬁt to the QLF and show more
“reliable” behavors in term of black hole MF evolution with re-
spect to other model inputs (see Appendix A). Here below, we
refer to these models just for the diﬀerent value of the radiative
eﬃciency, but the reader should keep in mind also the diﬀerent
local BHMF used. In Appendix A we show results with diﬀerent
combinations of ǫ and the local BHMF, and we provide a general
discussion about the uncertainties in the model predictions.

4.1. Bolometricquasarluminosityfunction

In Fig. 5 we compare the QLF estimated by Hopkins et al.
(2007), with the LF obtained from the three models. In gen-
eral, the models accurately reproduce the observational LF, al-
though the transition between the low– and high–luminosity
tail is smoother in the models. At redshifts z > 2, the case
with ǫ = 0.1 tends to underestimate the observational QLF for
L >∼ 1047 erg s−1, due to the very low number density of SMBHs
with M > 109 M⊙ predicted by the model (see below).

In Fig. 5, we also plot the contribution to the QLF from
SMBHs in diﬀerent range of masses. The shape of these
contributions reﬂects the Eddington ratio distribution. For a
small interval of masses, in fact, the QLF is simply Φ(L) ≈
P(λ|M)ΦAGN(M). It is clearly visible the peak of the log–normal
distribution of type–1 AGNs and, at high redshifts, we can as-
sociate to each luminosity a narrow range of masses for the
SMBHs that mainly contribute to the QLF.

4.2. MassfunctionanddutycycleofSMBHs

In Fig. 6 we show the model predictions for the evolution
of the BHMF between redshift 0 and 4. Our results agree
with an anti–hierarchical growth of SMBHs (“cosmic down-
sizing”), where most of the low–mass SMBHs formed later
in time than high–mass SMBHs (e.g., Granato et al. 2001;
Ueda et al. 2003; Marconi et al. 2004; Merloni & Heinz 2008;
Shankar et al. 2009). More quantitatively, at low redshifts the
mass function evolves only at low/intermediate masses, and it
decreases of about 30–60% from z = 0 to 1 for objects of 106–
107 M⊙. On the contrary, the number density of very massive
SMBHs (M >∼ 109 M⊙) practically does not change up to z = 1,
and then undergoes a signiﬁcant evolution.

The details of the SMBH cosmic history depend strongly on
the radiative eﬃciency. If we compare the results for ǫ = 0.05
and 0.07, we note a much faster evolution after redshift 2 if
ǫ = 0.05. In this case, the BHMF drops by one order of mag-
nitude between z = 2 and 4 in the all range of masses. Instead,
both the models with ǫ = 0.1 and 0.07 predict a similar moder-
ate evolution of the BHMF, mainly at redshifts 0–2 for low–mass
objects and at 1–3 for M > 108 M⊙. In both cases, the MF does
not signiﬁcantly change between z = 3 and 4, and at these red-
shifts it is only a factor <∼ 10 lower than the local BHMF. The
main diﬀerence between the two models is the larger number
density of very massive SMBHs predicted by the model with
ǫ = 0.07, as eﬀect of the diﬀerent local BHMF employed.

The duty cycle is also shown in Fig. 6 and the best–ﬁt pa-
rameters of Eq. 12–13 are provided in Table 1. We can point out
a general trend in all the three cases: at z <∼ 1 the duty cycle is

∼ 1 at M <∼ 107 M⊙ and then decreases with the SMBH mass.
At z > 1, the duty cycle is less dependent on M. For ǫ = 0.07
and 0.1 (to be noted the similar behavior of U(M, z)), it is almost
constant at z >∼ 2 and decreasing with time. On the contrary, for
ǫ = 0.05 the duty cycle always increases with the redshift and
basically all SMBHs are active at z = 4. In this case, because
of the strong evolution of the BHMF, a high fraction of active
SMBHs is required in order to ﬁt the QLF at high redshifts.

Given the BHMF and the duty cycle, it is straightforward
to compute the mass function for active SMBHs (i.e., the AGN
MF). All the models predict very similar AGN MFs3 (see Fig. 6
and Fig. 7, where the type–1 and type–2 AGN MFs are given
separately). The number density of low mass AGN decreases by
more than an order of magnitude between z = 0 and 4. On the
contrary, for massive AGN (M > 108 M⊙) the number density
peaks at redshifts 1–2 and then rapidly decreases (by a factor
∼ 10) up to z = 4. This is a signature of the cosmic downsizing
of AGN. To be noted in Fig. 7 the increase of the fraction of
type–1 AGN with the SMBH mass.

It is important to stress that, contrary to what occurs for the
BHMF, the AGN MF is almost insensitive to the choice of the lo-
cal mass function and of the value of ǫ. This result can be under-
stood considering that our method, and in general standard con-
tinuity equation approaches, uses as observational constraints
the QLF that depends, through Eq. 14, on the AGN MF but not
on the BHMF. If the Eddington ratio distribution for SMBHs is
known, the QLF puts strong constraints on the AGN mass func-
tion, at least for masses M <∼ 109 M⊙ (more massive SMBHs
give a quite small contribution to the QLF, as shown in Fig. 5).
On the contrary, the continuity equation method is not able to
constrain details of the SMBH growth history, that depend on
the model parameters (see also Caplar et al. 2014; Veale et al.
2014). In our model, where the Eddington ratio distribution is
ﬁxed on the basis of observational data, the duty cycle degen-
erates with the input choice of the radiative eﬃciency and the
local mass function. Only a direct measurement of the BHMF at
redshifts z >∼ 2 could break these degeneracies giving important
constraints on the average radiative eﬃciency.

A useful quantity to have information on the typical accre-
tion rate of SMBHs is the growth time, i.e. the ratio M/h ˙Mi
(Merloni & Heinz 2008). Fig. 8 shows the redshift evolution of
the growth time as a function of SMBH mass. In each panel, we
draw as a reference the age of the Universe at that time. SMBHs

3 The only exception is at M >∼ 109 M⊙, where the model with ǫ = 0.1
predicts a signiﬁcant lower number density of active SMBHs. However,
because it also tends to underestimate the observational QLF at high
luminosities, we expect that the actual MF is larger than predicted by
the model in this range of masses. This issue may be related to the use
of the LMF03 local BHMF.

Black dotted lines show the contribution to the LF from SMBHs with mass in the interval indicated in the plots (e.g., “6” corresponds to a mass
interval [5 × 105, 5 × 106) M⊙), for the model with ǫ = 0.05.

with growth time longer than the age of the Universe are not
experiencing a major growth phase, which must have necessar-
ily happened in the past. On the contrary, objects with growth
times shorter than that are actively growing. Looking at Fig. 8,
we see that only small mass SMBHs (M <∼ 107 M⊙) can be ac-
tually growing in mass at low redshifts (see also Fig. 4). This
is expected according to the downsizing behavior of SMBHs,
in which only low–mass SMBHs are still accreting mass and
growing in the local universe or at low redshift, and it is in
agreement with observational constraints (Heckman et al. 2004;
Greene & Ho 2007; Goulding et al. 2010; Schulze & Wisotzki
2010). The main epoch of growth for SMBHs is around redshift
1.5–3. At these redshifts the growth time is almost independent
of M and below the age of the Universe. At z > 3 the growth
time becomes typically larger of the age of the Universe except
for ǫ = 0.05. In this case, the growth time steadly decreases and
SMBHs are active and growing independent of their mass up to
at least redshift 4.

Fig. 9 illustrates the evolution of the integrated SMBH mass

density, ρBH = R log(M)MΦBH(M), as predicted by the mod-

els. The interesting feature is the very diﬀerent time evolution
of ρBH between the model with ǫ = 0.05 and 0.07/0.1. In the
latter the evolution is modest, decreasing by a factor ∼ 5 from
redshift 0 to 4. On the contrary, for ǫ = 0.05 the mass density
is lower than 104 M⊙ Mpc−3 at z = 4, i.e. around two order of
magnitude below the local density. This behavior is in very good
agreement with observational ﬁndings from Ueda et al. (2014),

Article number, page 8 of 15

that are obtained from a compilation of AGN X-ray luminosity
surveys assuming a radiative eﬃciency of 0.05.

The diﬀerent evolution of the BHMF, as predicted by
our models, has important implications on models for the
seed population of SMBHs (see, e.g., Volonteri et al. 2008;
Volonteri 2010). Our results with large radiative eﬃciencies
(ǫ ≥ 0.07) indicate that a large fraction of SMBHs were al-
ready formed at z > 4. This imply very massive primordial
black hole seeds, as expected from the direct collapse of su-
permassive stars (e.g. Koushiappas et al. 2004; Begelman et al.
2006; Lodato & Natarajan 2007; Devecchi & Volonteri 2009).
The case with ǫ = 0.05 is instead more compatible with mod-
els in which primordial black holes originate from stellar mass
progenitors (remnants of the ﬁrst, Population III, stars; see e.g.,
Abel et al. 2000; Bromm et al. 2002) and that predict negligible
SMBH mass density at high redshifs.

If we consider active SMBHs, Fig. 9 shows a peak in the
mass density of type–2 and type–1 AGN at around redshifts 1–
1.5. The peak is more pronounced in type–1 AGN due to the
increase of their fraction with luminosity and redshift. As ex-
pected, the evolution of the AGN mass density is almost inde-
pendent of the model. The mass density is somewhat lower for
ǫ = 0.1, as eﬀect of the sharper drop of the mass function at
M >∼ 109 M⊙, observed in Fig. 7.

and the local mass function. At z < 1 the BHMF evolves only at M < 108 M⊙, while number density of very massive SMBHs undergoes a strong
evolution a higher redshifts. At z > 1 details of the SMBH cosmic history depend strongly on the radiative eﬃciency. (Middle Panels) The duty
cycle U(M, z) as predicted by the models. At z < 1 the duty cycle is ∼ 1 for SMBHs of M < 107 M⊙ and then decreases with the mass. The behavior
of the duty cycle is very similar for the models with ǫ = 0.1 and 0.07, increasing from redshift 0 to 1, and decreasing at z > 2. For ǫ = 0.05 it
always increases and almost all SMBHs are active at z ∼ 4. (Bottom Panels) The AGN MF as predicted by the models. This is almost insensitive
to the choice of the local mass function and to the value of the radiative eﬃciency. The number density of active SMBHs with M ≥ 108 M⊙ peaks
at redshifts 1–2 and then rapidly decreases.

4.3. Comparisonwithobservations

Observational estimates of the quasar mass function and of
the Eddington ratio distribution function (ERDF) are a promis-
ing test for model predictions. Nevertheless, the direct com-
parison between model and observations is not
trivial due
to selection eﬀects in quasar samples. A standard approach
to compute the MF and ERDF is based on the 1/Vmax esti-

mator with the same volume weights as for the QLF (e.g.,
Wang et al. 2006; Vestergaard et al. 2008; Vestergaard & Osmer
2009; Schulze & Wisotzki 2010; Nobuta et al. 2012). This
method has shown to suﬀer from severe incompleteness due
to active SMBHs below the ﬂux limit of the survey that are
not taking into account (see discussion in Kelly et al. 2009;
Schulze & Wisotzki 2010; Schulze et al. 2015). Uncertainties

Universe at that redshift. Lines indicate the diﬀerent values of ǫ: black,
red and green lines are for ǫ = 0.05, 0.07 and 0.1, respectively. The
main epoch of growth is at 1 < z < 3. At later time, only low–mass
SMBHs can be actually growing in mass, while at earlier time only in
the model with ǫ = 0.05 the growth time is much lower than the age of
the Universe.

(red lines), 0.05 (black lines). The AGN mass functions are practically
independent of the model in the all redshift range. The fraction of type–
1 AGN increases with mass.

and scatter in the relation to estimate SMBH masses have
also to be considered for a proper MF determination. Sev-
eral studies have estimated the MF and ERDF for type–1
AGN, employing statistical methods to properly account for
the survey selection function and the uncertainties in SMBH
mass estimates (Kelly et al. 2009; Schulze & Wisotzki 2010;
Shen & Kelly 2012; Nobuta et al. 2012; Kelly & Shen 2013;
Schulze et al. 2015). Their results are model dependent because
they use analytic functions to describe the bivariate distribution
function of M and λ.

Kelly & Shen (2013) determined the MF and the ERDF for a
sample of type–1 AGN from the SDSS at redshifts 0.4 < z < 5.
They found that the sample becomes signiﬁcantly incomplete (<∼
10%) at M <∼ 3 × 108 M⊙ or λ <∼ 0.07, with some variation with
redshift. In Fig. 10 we plot their results and we compare them
with predictions of our models. At a ﬁxed redshift, we compute
the MF of type–1 AGN as:

Φ

type1

AGN (M) = ΦAGN(M) an(M)Z 1

log λmin

and the ERDF as:

d log λ funo(L)P1(λ)

(15)

Φ

type1

AGN (λ) = P1(λ)Z 11

log Mmin

d log M an(M) funo(L) ΦAGN(M) , (16)

where funo(L) is the fraction of type–1 AGN with luminosity
L, and Mmin (λmin) is the minimum SMBH mass (Eddington ra-
tio) associated to the ﬂux–limited survey used in Kelly & Shen
(2013). The actual values of Mmin and λmin are not well deter-
mined and we choose two values that should represent upper and
lower limits for them (see Table 2).

Fig. 10 shows our predictions for the models with ǫ = 0.1
and 0.07 (the results are similar for ǫ = 0.05 and 0.07 mod-
els). At redshifts z < 2 the MF is rather dependent on the

results from Ueda et al. (2014). If ǫ = 0.1 or 0.07 the evolution of the
mass density is quite modest. On the contrary, if ǫ = 0.05, the mass
density at z = 4 is two order of magnitude lower than the local one. The
AGN mass density has similar evolution for the three cases, with a peak
at around z = 1–1.5.

choice of λmin due to the broad shape of the ERDF, that peaks
at 0.01 ≤ λ < 0.1. The comparison with observations is more
interesting at high redshifts where the choice of λmin is less im-
portant. In general, the models are reasonably consistent with
observational estimates of Kelly & Shen (2013). The case with
ǫ = 0.1 better reproduces the shape of the observational MF at
low redshifts, but fails at high redshifts where it strongly under-
estimates the observations for M >∼ 109 M⊙. Viceversa, models
with ǫ = 0.05/0.07 ﬁt very well the data at z >∼ 2, but at low
redshifts the predicted MF seems to decrease too slowly with
the mass and gives an excess of high–mass type–1 AGN. We
have to note, however, that SMBHs with M >∼ 5 × 109 M⊙ give
a negligible contribution to the QLF at z < 2 (see Fig. 5), and
the AGN MF is therefore poorly constrained by the analysis at
these masses. This argument does not work for the discrepancy
observed in the ǫ = 0.1 model: the fast decline of the MF at
high redshifts cannot be reconciled with the observations even
assuming duty cycles equal 1.

Concerning the ERDF, we remind that the model use a log–
normal function that ﬁts the shape of the Eddington ratio distri-
bution determined by Kelly & Shen (2013) at the diﬀerent red-
shifts. Therefore in Fig. 10 we simply verify if the amplitude of
the ERDF computed by Eq. 16 is consistent with observational
results. The agreement is good with Mmin = 108 M⊙, apart from
the ﬁrst and last redshift bin in which Mmin = 107 and 109 M⊙
provide a better ﬁt to the data. The only discrepancies we ob-
serve are at z = 2.15 and 2.65, where our predictions are signiﬁ-
cant lower than data. However, Kelly & Shen (2013) questioned
the reliability of their estimates at these redshift bins because
they found an apparent discontinuity across z ∼ 2 in the number
densities of type–1 AGN radiating at λ >∼ 0.05. They attributed
the discontinuity to systematic errors in the incompleteness cor-
rection, but it could be also due to the diﬀerent mass estimator
used before and after z ∼ 2 (Schulze et al. 2015).

Our predictions on the ERDF at z ∼ 2 are instead well consis-
tent with results from Schulze et al. (2015, blue lines in Fig. 10).
They combined large area SDSS data with two deep, small area
surveys (VVDS and zCOSMOS) to cover a wide range of lumi-
nosities at redshifts 1 <∼ z <∼ 2. They use a maximum likelihood
approach to ﬁt a parametric bivariate distribution function in the
intervals of −2 < log λ < 1 and 7 < log(M/ M⊙ < 11. Their es-
timates agree well with the Kelly & Shen (2013) MF and ERDF
at redshift z < 2. In Fig. 10 we also consider the results from
Nobuta et al. (2012), that used the Subaru XMM–Newton Deep
Survey (SXDS) to determine the MF and ERDF at z ∼ 1.4. Their
sample is X-ray selected and extends signiﬁcantly deeper than
SDSS, over an area of ∼ 1.0 deg2. Their MF is in agreement
with the other estimates in the mass range 8–9.5 M⊙, while they
show a turnover at lower masses not conﬁrmed by the other data.
Some discrepancies are also observed in the ERDF that gives a
much larger probability for high accretion SMBHs.

Finally, in Fig. 11 we consider the local MF and ERDF for
type–1 AGN computed by Schulze & Wisotzki (2010). They
used a sample of local (z < 0.3) broad line AGN from the Ham-
burg/ESO Survey. In the Figure we report the MF and ERDF di-

rectly determined from the data (red points) and after the incom-
pleteness correction through a maximum likelihood approach
(red lines). The model seems to be in better agreement with
the observational MF before the incompleteness correction (it
requires λmin ≃ 0.1). On the contrary, the predicted ERDF is
consistent with data only after the incompleteness correction.

5. Conclusions

In this paper we have studied the time evolution of the mass func-
tion of SMBHs and of their active population (i.e., SMBHs with
λ ≥ 10−4) by the continuity equation, backwards in time from
now to redshift 4. In our approach we distinguish active SMBHs
between type–1 and type–2 AGN. The Eddington ratio distribu-
tion of the two classes are chosen on the basis of observational
estimates, assuming a log–normal distribution and a truncated
power law for type–1 and type–2 AGN, respectively. The duty
cycle of SMBHs, as a function of redshift and mass, is instead
determined from the best ﬁt of the observational quasar lumi-
nosity functions of Hopkins et al. (2007). The only free parame-
ter of the model is the average radiative eﬃciency ǫ of SMBHs,
which is assumed constant. Moreover, we have considered two
possible inputs for the local SMBH mass function, one in agree-
ment with the Shankar et al. (2009) local BHMF and the other
with the revised estimates from Shankar et al. (2013). Below we
summarize and discuss our results.

– The evolution of the BHMF, especially at z >∼ 2, is very sen-
sitive to the value of the average radiative eﬃciency. This is
clearly shown by comparing the results using ǫ = 0.07 and
0.05: with the lower radiative eﬃciency, the evolution of the
BHMF is signiﬁcantly stronger at z >∼ 2 and at z = 4 the
mass function is one order of magnitude lower than that with

ǫ = 0.07. For larger radiative eﬃciencies, we ﬁnd very little
evolution in the MF, especially at low masses, and the num-
ber density of SMBHs (of M <∼ 109 M⊙) increased by only
a factor ∼ 4 (2) from z = 4 to 0 if ǫ = 0.1 (0.15). Radiative
eﬃciencies much larger than 0.1 seem to be discarded by
our model. In this case, in fact, the BHMF is almost constant
through the time, implying that most of SMBHs we observe
now were already formed before redshift 4.

– Independently of the parameters of the model, we conﬁrm
an anti–hierarchical growth of SMBHs. Black holes of M >∼
109 M⊙ stop forming at redshift 1 in all our models, while
lower–mass SMBHs typically grow later or keep growing
in all the redshift range according to the model. The anti–
hierarchical behavior can be observed also in the duty cycle:
at low redshift this is close to 1 for objects of M <∼ 107 M⊙
and it is rapidly decreasing with the mass.

– Results for ǫ ≥ 0.07 and ǫ ∼ 0.05 imply quite diﬀerent sce-
narios for the SMBH evolution at high redshifts. In the ﬁrst
case, a large number density of SMBHs, most of them qui-
escent, are already in place at z >∼ 4 (the mass density is of
the order of 105 M⊙ Mpc−3). On the other hand, the model
with ǫ = 0.05 predicts a small number density of SMBHs at
high redshifts (ρBH < 104 M⊙ Mpc−3 z ∼ 4). The duty cycle
is steadly increasing with redshift and almost all SMBHs are
active at z ≃ 4. The ﬁrst scenario would require primordial
black hole seeds that are very massive, as expected from the
direct collapse of supermassive stars, while the second one is
more compatible with models in which the primordial black
holes originate from stellar mass progenitors.

– The MF of active SMBHs does not depend on the choice
of the radiative eﬃciency or of the local BHMF, but it is
mainly determined by the quasar LF, once the Eddington
ratio distribution is ﬁxed. Our approach provides therefore
strict predictions on the evolution of active SMBHs. This is

the main result of the analysis and it is well described by
Fig. 12. In this Figure we plot the uncertainty on the pre-
dicted SMBH and AGN MFs at diﬀerent redshifts: they are
obtained by combining the results (including uncertainties;
see Appendix A) from the three best models discussed in the
paper, i.e. ǫ = 0.05, 0.07 and 0.1. We can see that the AGN
MF is typically very well constrained and the uncertainty in-
creases only for very massive SMBHs, whose contribution
to the observational quasar LF is small or negligible. On the
contrary, as already stressed, our approach is less predictive
of the evolution of the BHMF, which is more dependent on
the model parameters, especially at high redshifts.

– The evolution of active SMBHs shows an anti–hierarchical
behavior too. The MF of low–mass AGN steadily increases
with time, while for intermediate/high–mass AGN we ﬁnd
a peak in the number density between redshift 1 and 2. As
example, the number density of M ∼ 109 M⊙ AGN peaks
around z = 1.5 and it is about 8 times larger than now (and
than at z = 3.4, whose number density is equal to the local
one).

– Information on the actual Eddington ratio distribution of
SMBHs are still incomplete and uncertain. We have tested
our results against diﬀerent choices of the Eddington ratio
distribution for type–1 and type–2 AGN. In general, we ob-
serve a modest impact on the evolution of the AGN MF, com-
patible with the uncertainty of the model. The largest dis-
crepancy has been found if the distribution for type–2 AGN
is assumed to be a steep (αλ = −0.6) and constant power law
over the all redshift range4. In this case, most of AGN are
then weakly active through the time and the BHMF evolves

4 We remind that our reference distribution is a power law with αλ =
−0.6 at z ≤ 0.6 and a ﬂattening slope at higher redshifts.

very moderately. As expected, the AGN MF is larger with
respect to our previous results, but at most by a factor ∼ 2.

We can conclude that our models provide robust and strict
predictions on the evolution of the mass function for type–1 and
type–2 AGN. Moreover, they forecast two diﬀerent possible sce-
narios for the cosmic history of SMBHs that depend on the av-
erage radiative eﬃciency, and that can be proved by future space
missions as Athena and JSWT.

main part of the paper. When ǫ > 0.1, the BHMF does not evolve
signiﬁcantly over time for M <∼ 108 M⊙, as shown by Fig. A.1.
Instead, for ǫ < 0.1 the evolution of high–mass SMBHs is too
fast and, consequently, the model strongly underestimates the
high–luminosity part of the observational QLF at high redshifts
because of the lack of active SMBHs with M ≫ 108 M⊙. On the
other hand, if the local mass function with 0.5 dex Gaussian scat-
ter (LMF05) is used, we typically ﬁnd better ﬁts to the QLF in-
dependent of the choice of the radiative eﬃciency. Nevertheless,
again, when ǫ >∼ 0.1, the BHMF exhibits a very small evolution
at all the range of masses (see Fig. A.1).

These results can be understood taking into account that the
average accretion rate is proportional to (1 − ǫ)/ǫ and increases
by a factor 2 reducing ǫ from 0.1 to 0.05. If we use a local mass
function with low number density of very massive SMBHs (as
the LMF03 one), the duty cycle at these masses will be large in
order to ﬁt the high–luminosity tail of the QLF. The combina-
tion of a low radiative eﬃciency and a high duty cycle gives a
high accretion rate and a fast evolution of high–mass SMBHs,
whose number density will become too small at high redshifts.
Viceversa, the argument can be overturned in the case of high
radiative eﬃciencies associated to the LMF05 local mass func-
tion: the no–evolving MFs discussed before are then observed.
We can conclude that, independently of the local BHMF, models
with ǫ > 0.1 seem to be disfavored. They entail in fact an aver-
age accretion rate that is too low to produce SMBHs signiﬁcantly
growing with redshifts.

Fig. A.2 shows the 1–σ errors associated to the SMBH and
AGN MFs for ǫ = 0.07, obtained from the MCMC method.
They are quite small, due to the strong constraints imposed by
the quasar luminosity function. Clearly, they are not representa-
tive of the uncertainties of the model, that are mainly drawn by
the uncertainties on the value of the average radiative eﬃciency
and on the Eddington ratio distribution.

In Fig. A.2 we also investigate the eﬀect of varying λcut,
which deﬁnes the minimum accreation rate for an active SMBH.
We extrapolate the power–law behavior of the Eddington ratio
distribution for type–2 AGN up to λcut = 10−5 (type–1 AGN are
not aﬀected by the choice of λcut). This is probably an extreme
situation because we expect a drop in P(λ) somewhere below
λ ≃ 10−4 (Hopkins & Hernquist 2009; Fanidakis et al. 2012). As
expected, we ﬁnd larger MFs, but the eﬀect is modest both for
SMBHs and for AGN.

Observations give only very partial constraints on the Ed-
dington ratio distribution. For type–1 AGN they are limited to
the highest values of the Eddington ratio (λ >∼ 0.1), while for
type–2 AGN the Eddington ratio distribution is determined over
a large range of accretion rates (from ∼ 10−4 to 1) but only for
z < 1. Here below we discuss how the model predictions (es-
pecially in relation to the AGN MF) can change if diﬀerent Ed-
dington ratio distributions are employed. Results are shown in
Fig. A.3.
– So far we have used a log–normal function to ﬁt the Edding-
ton ratio distributions estimated by Kelly & Shen (2013).
However this is not the only possible choice. A truncated
power law, as used for type–2 AGN (Eq. 9), also provides a
good ﬁt to data. We use the same power–law index as for

the Kelly & Shen (2013) estimates at the diﬀerent redshift
bins. The AGN MFs are typically well compatible with pre-
vious results, while BHMFs are a bit lower especially at high
redshifts.

Appendix A: Testing model assumptions

Here we discuss solutions of the continuity equation with
diﬀerent values/combinations of the radiative eﬃciency and
the local BHMF. Firstly, let us consider models with a local
BHMF obtained by the convolution with 0.3 dex Gaussian scat-
ter (LMF03). We ﬁnd acceptable ﬁts to the observational QLF
only for ǫ >∼ 0.1. The results for ǫ = 0.1 were discussed in the

observed mainly at low/intermediate masses, at which the
number density is larger by a factor <∼ 2 with respect to the
reference model. Finally, the second model does not produce
large changes on MFs.

We can conclude that using diﬀerent Eddington ratio distri-
butions seems to have a limited impact on the BHMF evolution.
The uncertainty on it is dominated by the radiative eﬃciency
that can vary from ǫ = 0.05 to 0.1. In principle, the AGN MF
should be more sensitive to the choice of P(λ). However, we
see that the changes are not very relevant. They are signiﬁcantly
larger than the intrinsic uncertainty associated to the models only
when we take a constant Eddington ratio distribution for type–2
AGN. The uncertainty on the Eddington ratio distribution then
simply translates into a small increase of the uncertainty on the
model predictions. This proves that our approach gives robust
constraints on the AGN MF up to redshifts 4.

obtained after changing the Eddington ratio distribution. Lines are for
following cases: (1) we use a truncated power law for P(λ) of type–1
AGN (red short dashed lines); (2) a power–law distribution for type–
2 AGN with constant slope αλ = −0.6 (black solid lines); (3) a faster
evolving power–law distribution (αλ = −0.6/(0.4 + z)1.5) for type–2
AGN (green long dashed lines). Shaded areas are for the uncertainty of

dependences of the power–law index with respect to the one
used in Eq. 10. We consider two opposite situations: (1) we
extrapolate the distribution observed at low redshifts to high
redshifts, keeping a constant slope αλ = −0.6 over the all
redshift range; (2) we use a steeper redshift dependence,
αλ = −0.6/(0.4 + z)1.5. As expected, the former gives mass
functions that evolve more slowly at z >∼ 1. The eﬀect is
