Abstract

A coupled BEM/FEM formulation for the transient interaction between an
acoustic ﬁeld and a piezoelectric scatterer is proposed. The scattered part of the
acoustic wave is represented in terms of retarded layer potentials while the elas-
tic displacement and electric potential are treated variationally. This results in an
integro-diﬀerential system. Well posedness of a general Galerkin semi-discretization
in space of the problem is shown in the Laplace domain and translated into ex-
plicit stability bounds in the time domain. Trapezoidal-Rule and BDF2 Convo-
lution Quadrature are used in combination with matching time stepping for time
discretization. Second order convergence is proven for the BDF2-based method.
Numerical experiments are provided for BDF2 and Trapezoidal Rule based time
evolution.

Introduction

The study of the interaction between acoustic waves and elastic structures has been sub-
ject of much work in recent decades. Many of the recent modeling and computational
eﬀorts have been driven by the need to develop and improve techniques for vibration
control and reduction. Passive techniques rely on the use of sound absorbing materials
that dissipate the energy of the acoustic wave and have been successfully used to damp
high-frequency vibrations. On the other hand, active techniques employing piezoelec-
tric materials exploit the adaptability of the piezoelectric solid to react to the vibrations

in order to cancel them. Active materials are used to provide extra control in the low
frequency range.

In the frequency domain, works like [11, 12] have derived mathematical models and
variational formulations suitable for numerical treatment of the process, their approach
uses an eﬀective load to model the action of the incident acoustic wave on the piezoelectric
material and is geared towards a ﬁnite element solution of all the unknowns involved in
the problem. In the time domain, [1] is a classic reference for ﬁnite element simulation
of waves in piezoelectrics, and a thorough review of the work done on this area up until
the early 2000’s can be found in [9]. The propagation of plane waves waves in layered
piezoelectric media has been addressed recently in [32, 36], using analytical methods to
study the reﬂection and transmission of plane waves at the interface of media with diﬀerent
material coeﬃcients. Within the context of dynamic crack propagation in piezoelectric
solids, ﬁnite element formulations have been explored in [15, 30], while Boundary Integral
Equations (BIE) have been treated in [31, 24, 17]. Time domain BIE’s for a purely
piezoelectric problem have been used in recent works like [16, 37], where a Nystr¨om
approach is followed for the space discretization and Convolution Quadrature is used in
time.
In both cases the model concerns only the propagation of the wave inside the
piezoelectric material and no interaction with an acoustic wave is considered.

The present article describes, discretizes, and analyzes the complete interaction prob-
lem, considering an incident acoustic wave that interacts with a piezoelectric scatterer
through coupling boundary conditions inducing an elastic wave within the piezoelectric
obstacle and a scattered acoustic wave traveling in a homogeneous unbounded domain.
The system of PDE’s used to model the problem combines the acoustic/elastic coupling
conditions presented in [22] for wave structure interaction, with the PDE’s used in [12]
to describe the time evolution of the relevant variables. Aiming for a Finite Element
discretization of the elastic and electric variables and a boundary element treatment of
the acoustic wave, the system is translated into an integro-diﬀerential problem in the
Laplace domain, the analysis is carried out following the techniques systematized in [26]
and originated in the seminal work [2]. Galerkin discretization in space is used for all the
variables, while Convolution Quadrature combined with time stepping are used for the
time evolution.

We prove that the resulting fully discrete problem is well-posed and determine stability
and error bounds with explicit time dependence for the time discretization based on second
order backwards diﬀerentiation formulas (BDF2). A similar study with the backward
Euler method is easy to obtain, while a Trapezoidal Rule CQ method is also available [4],
but knowledge of the behavior of constants with respect to time is not known at current
time.

The paper is structured as follows. The general problem is presented in Section 2,
where the time domain PDE model and the geometry are introduced along with the
required notation and assumptions on physical parameters. Section 3 introduces the
Laplace-transformed problem. Using standard BIE techniques we derive an equivalent
integro-diﬀerential system and pose it variationally. The error equations satisﬁed by the
resulting Galerkin space semi-discretization and the required elliptic projector are then
presented. The core of the analysis is done in Section 4, where a slightly more general dis-
crete system –encompassing both the discrete-in-space problem and the error equations–

2

is shown to be uniquely solvable by studying the variational formulation of an equivalent
transmission problem; stability bounds are obtained in terms of the Laplace parameter
s. The main results in the time domain are presented in Section 5, where the estimates
obtained in the previous section are translated into the time domain and the system is
fully discretized with BDF2-based Convolution Quadrature; for suﬃciently smooth prob-
lem data second-order-in-time convergence is proven. Section 6 is dedicated to numerical
experiments, some remarks pertaining the implementation of CQ and the coupling of
boundary and ﬁnite elements are followed by experiments conﬁrming convergence for the
methods based in BDF2 and Trapezoidal Rule. Conclusions and possibilities for further
studies are discussed in Section 7.

will be used for scalar, vector and matrix-valued real L2 inner products. (In the latter
the colon denotes the Frobenius inner product of matrices.) When using complex-valued
functions the brackets will remain bilinear and conjugation will be used as needed. If Ω is
an open set with Lipschitz boundary or the complementary of such a set, then H 1(Ω) is
the usual Sobolev space and its norm will be denoted by (cid:107)·(cid:107)1,Ω. The space H 1/2(∂Ω) is the
trace space, while H−1/2(∂Ω) is the representation of its dual when L2(∂Ω) is identiﬁed
with its dual space. The norms of H±1/2(∂Ω), both for the real and complex valued cases,
will be denoted (cid:107) · (cid:107)±1/2,∂Ω. We will ﬁnally denote L2(Ω) := L2(Ω)d, H1(Ω) := H 1(Ω)d,
etc., and endow these spaces with the natural product norms.

2 Problem statement

Geometric considerations. We will assume that the piezoelectric obstacle occupies a
bounded, open and connected region Ω− ⊂ Rd with Lipschitz boundary Γ which might
not be connected. The boundary will be partitioned in two non-overlapping Dirichlet and
Neumann parts, open relative to Γ and such that Γ = ΓD ∪ ΓN and ΓD (cid:54)= ∅.

We will adopt the convention that the unit normal vector to the boundary ν will be
taken exterior to Ω− and as such, it will always point towards the acoustic unbounded
domain Ω+ := Rd \ Ω−.

Interior variables.
displacement ﬁeld u and the electric potential ψ

In the interior domain the problem variables will be the elastic

u : Ω− × [0,∞) −→ Rd,

ψ : Ω− × [0,∞) −→ R.

Diﬀerential operators in the space variables will be unsubscripted meaning, for instance,
that ∇ψ is the gradient in the space variables only.

Physical parameters and tensors. We will use the following constitutive relations
[35] to deﬁne the piezoelectric stress tensor σ and the electric displacement vector D

σ := Cε(u) + e∇ψ ,

In the above deﬁnition

ε(u) := 1

D := e(cid:62)ε(u) − ∇ψ.

is the linear elastic strain tensor, C, e, and  are the elastic compliance, piezoelectric,
and dielectric tensors respectively. They encode the electric and elastic properties of the
material. For a real symmetric matrix M ∈ Rd×d

Due to physical considerations, these tensors exhibit the following symmetries [25]:

j

Cijkl = Cjikl = Cklij ,

(2.2)
We will require that the components of the tensors are functions in L∞(Ω−) and that for
any symmetric matrix M ∈ Rd×d
sym and d ∈ Rd there exist positive constants c0 and d0
such that for almost every x ∈ Ω−

elij = elji ,

il = li.

C(x)M : M ≥ c0M : M ,

(x)d · d ≥ d0d · d.

The density of the piezoelectric material will be denoted by ρΣ and will be taken to be a
strictly positive function in L∞(Ω−).

Exterior domain. We will assume that the unbounded domain Ω+ surrounding the
obstacle is ﬁlled with an homogeneous, isotropic and irrotational ﬂuid with constant
density ρf . Since the ﬂuid is irrotational we can introduce a scalar velocity potential
v such that the actual ﬂuid velocity can be expressed as v = ∇v. As is standard, the
total acoustic wave ﬁeld vtot will be the superposition of a given incident ﬁeld vinc and an
unknown scattered ﬁeld v:

vtot = vinc + v.

Note that even if the domain Ω− has a cavity the total wave there will contain a non-
zero contribution of the incident wave, since vinc would be a solution of the problem
in the absence of the scatterer. This decomposition is non-physical but mathematically
meaningful. We will require that for t ≤ 0 the incident wave has not yet reached the
obstacle.

Figure 1: Scheme of the scattering geometry. The problem unknowns are the scattered acoustic wave
v (deﬁned in the unbounded region Ω+), the induced elastic wave u, and the electric potential ψ (both
deﬁned inside the obstacle Ω−).The total elastic boundary Γ is the disjoint union of the electric Dirichlet
boundary ΓD, and the electric Neumann boundary ΓN which are both open relative to Γ. The normal
vectors ν are exterior to the elastic domain and point towards the acoustic domain Ω+.

The PDE model. Under all the above considerations, and recalling the deﬁnitions
(2.1), the interaction between the incident acoustic wave and the piezoelectric scatterer
is governed by the following system of PDE’s (see, for instance, [23, 12]):

∆v = c−2vtt
∇ · σ = ρΣutt
∇ · D = 0

ut · ν + ∂νv = − αd
σ ν + ρf vtν = − ρf (βd)tν

D · ν = ηd

with homogeneous initial conditions for v, vt, u, and ut.

The problem data is

αd := ∂νvinc|Γ : Γ × [0,∞) −→ R,
βd := vinc|Γ : Γ × [0,∞) −→ R,

ηd : ΓN × [0,∞) −→ R,
µd : ΓD × [0,∞) −→ R.

This system can be given a rigorous form using causal distributions taking values in
Sobolev spaces as in [22, 26], etc. For the time being will will deal only with the Laplace
transform of this system and will come back to the time domain only at the time of giving
stability and error estimates.

Ω+Ω+Ω−Γνvincvu3 A Laplace domain semidiscrete problem

In order to cast this problem rigorously we will need to deﬁne precisely the meaning of
quantities on the boundary. Given v ∈ H 1(Rd \ Γ), its interior, exterior, averaged, and
diﬀerence traces will be denoted by:

γ−v,

γ+v,

{{v}} := 1

2(γ−v + γ+v),

[[γv]] := γ−v − γ+v.

For (u, ψ) ∈ H1(Ω−) × H 1(Ω−) such that

σ(u, ψ) = Cε(u) + e∇ψ ∈ L2(Ω−)d×d

we deﬁne the weak interior traction ﬁeld in analogy to the purely elastic normal stress
with the formula

(cid:104)σν, γw(cid:105)Γ := (Cε(u), ε(w))Ω− + (e∇ψ, ε(w))Ω− + (∇ · σ, w)Ω−

In a similar fashion, for (u, ψ) ∈ H1(Ω−) × H 1(Ω−) such that
D(u, ψ) = e(cid:62)ε(u) − ∇ψ ∈ L2(Ω−),

∀w ∈ H1(Ω−).

the weak normal electric displacement will be deﬁned by

(cid:104)D · ν, γw(cid:105)Γ := (ε(u), e∇w)Ω− − (∇ψ,∇w)Ω− + (∇ · D, w)Ω−

∀w ∈ H 1(Ω−).

These are, respectively, elements of the dual spaces H−1/2(Γ) and H−1/2(Γ). The Γ-
subscripted angled bracket will be used to denote the duality product of either H−1/2(Γ)
with H 1/2(Γ) or H−1/2(Γ) with H1/2(Γ).

To deal with the Dirichlet and Neumann conditions for the electric potential, we need
additional notation. The restriction to the Dirichlet boundary of the trace of a function
u ∈ H 1(Ω−) will be denoted by γDu := γu|ΓD and we deﬁne the function spaces

H 1/2(ΓD) :=(cid:8)γDu : u ∈ H 1(Ω−)(cid:9) ,
(cid:101)H 1/2(ΓN ) :=(cid:8)γu|ΓN : u ∈ H 1
D(Ω−)(cid:9) ,
(cid:101)H 1/2(ΓN ).
The angled bracket (cid:104)·,·(cid:105)ΓN should be understood as the duality pairing of H−1/2(ΓN ) with

D(Ω−) :=(cid:8)u ∈ H 1(Ω−) : γDu = 0(cid:9) ,
H−1/2(ΓN ) :=(cid:0)(cid:101)H 1/2(ΓN )(cid:1)(cid:48)

using the integral representation formula

v = S(s)λ − D(s)φ.

(3.2)

The operators S and D are known as the single and double layer potentials respectively.
Associated with the potentials, the following integral operators can be deﬁned

V(s) := {{γ·}}S(s) = γS(s),
K(cid:62)(s) := {{∂ν·}}S(s),

K(s) := {{γ·}}D(s),
W(s) := −{{∂ν·}}D(s) = −∂νD(s).

A coupled integro-diﬀerential system. Having deﬁned the notation and tools we
will borrow from potential theory, we can now introduce the continuous integro-diﬀerential
system that will be treated numerically later on.

If (v, u, ψ) is a solution of (3.1), then v can be represented as

v = D(s/c)φ − S(s/c)λ,

(3.4)

where φ = γ+v and λ = ∂+
yielding v ≡ 0 in Ω−. Therefore if we use (3.3) to write γ−v, we arrive at

ν v. Note that this representation can be extended to Ω−,

2I + K(s/c)(cid:1) φ = 0

B((u, ψ), (w, ϕ); s) := b(u, w; s) + (e∇ψ, ε(w))Ω−

(3.8b)
which is bounded in H1(Ω−) × H 1(Ω−). We also collect all the integral operators in

For the sake of notational simplicity, we will write D(s)(λ, φ) for the action of D(s) on

In order to discretize the system (3.9) a few deﬁnitions are in

only uses that these spaces are closed. This has the advantage of simultaneously providing
a well-posedness analysis of the continuous problem.) It will be assumed that the set

to an estimate like the one on the statement of the Lemma, can be approached using
standard arguments based on the hypothesis of the existence of an h-uniform lifting of

4 Laplace domain analysis

We consider a slightly more general problem from which both stability and error estimates
for (3.10) will be otained. Data are

d) ∈ H−1/2(Γ) × H 1/2(Γ) × H−1/2(ΓN ) × γDVh,

and

(θd, θd, λd, φd) ∈ H1(Ω−) × L2(Γ) × H−1/2(Γ) × H 1/2(Γ),

and we look for

((cid:98)uh,(cid:98)ψh) ∈ Vh × Vh,D and ((cid:98)λh,(cid:98)φh) ∈ H−1/2(Γ) × H 1/2(Γ)

such that for all (w, ϕ) ∈ Vh × Vh,D

Note that if the ﬁrst group of data (4.1a) is set to be zero and we take

(θd, θd, λd, φd) = (Phu − u, γ(Phu − u) · ν, λ, φ),

the system (4.2) reduces to the error equations (3.12), while if the second group of data
(4.1b) is identically zero then the discrete equations (3.10) are recovered.

(4.3)

Two equivalent problems. Using the Galerkin equations (4.2) as the starting point,
the analysis will proceed as in [26] by ﬁnding an equivalent transmission problem that
can then be studied variationally. Solvability will then be established for the variational
formulation and the stability constants will be obtained from the variational problem as
well.

Proposition 4.1 (Transmission problem). If ((cid:98)uh,(cid:98)ψh,(cid:98)λ,(cid:98)φ) solves (4.2), and
then ((cid:98)vh,(cid:98)uh,(cid:98)ψh) ∈ H 1(Rd \ Γ) × Vh × Vh,D satisﬁes for all (w, ϕ) ∈ Vh × Vh,D

B(((cid:98)uh,(cid:98)ψh), (w, ϕ); s) − ρf s(cid:104)[[γ(cid:98)vh]], γw · ν(cid:105)Γ = − ρf s(cid:104)βd, γw · ν(cid:105)Γ + (cid:104)ηd, γϕ(cid:105)ΓN

γD(cid:98)ψh = µh
ν(cid:98)vh) − (0, αd + sθd) ∈ X◦
Conversely, given a solution triplet ((cid:98)vh,(cid:98)uh,(cid:98)ψh) to (4.4) and deﬁning(cid:98)λh := −[[∂ν(cid:98)vh]], and
(cid:98)φh := −[[γ(cid:98)vh]], the functions ((cid:98)uh,(cid:98)ψh,(cid:98)λh,(cid:98)φh) solve (4.2).
Proof. Given a solution of (4.2) and deﬁning(cid:98)vh as in (4.3), it follows from the properties
that [[γ(cid:98)vh]] = −(cid:98)φh and [[∂ν(cid:98)vh]] = −(cid:98)λh, which shows that equations (4.4c) and (4.4e) follow

readily from (4.2b) and (4.2d) by substitution of the above terms. Moreover, using the

identities (3.3) to compute γ−(cid:98)vh and ∂+

ν(cid:98)vh, it can be seen that (4.2c) and (4.4d) are

equivalent.

The proof of the converse is very similar and requires only to observe that (4.4a) allows

for the layer potential representation of the acoustic ﬁeld

ν(cid:98)vh.
(cid:98)vh = D(s/c)γ+(cid:98)vh − S(s/c)∂+

Thus, deﬁning(cid:98)λh and (cid:98)φh as in the statement all the above arguments can be repeated to

show that equations (4.2) hold.

The system (4.4) can now be treated variationally. To do this we introduce the space

h :=(cid:8)w ∈ H 1(Rd \ Γ) : [[γw]] ∈ Yh, and γ−w ∈ X◦

V ∗

The following proposition gives the equivalent variational formulation from which the
solvability and stability bounds of the entire problem will be deduced.

Proposition 4.2 (Variational formulation). Consider the bilinear and linear forms

A((v, u, ψ), (w, w, ϕ); s) := (∇v,∇w)Rd\Γ + (s/c)2(v, w)Rd\Γ

+ B((u, ψ), (w, ϕ); s)
+ ρf s(cid:104)γu · ν, [[γw]](cid:105)Γ − ρf s(cid:104)[[γv]], γw · ν(cid:105)Γ,

(cid:96) ((w, w, ϕ); s) := − (cid:104)λd, γ−w(cid:105)Γ + (cid:104)αd + sθd, [[γw]](cid:105)Γ

+ (cid:104)ηd, γϕ(cid:105)ΓN .

The system (4.4) is equivalent to the problem of ﬁnding ((cid:98)vh,(cid:98)uh,(cid:98)ψh) ∈ H 1(Rd \ Γ) × Vh ×

This expression in combination with (4.4c) are equivalent to (4.5c).

where we have used the deﬁnition of the weak normal derivative ∂±

+ (cid:104)[[∂ν(cid:98)vh]] + λd, γ−w(cid:105)Γ.

To verify the converse statement, we expand the bilinear form in (4.5c) and rewrite it

h it

Once the equation is rewritten in this form, it is enough to notice that the mapping

h × Vh × Vh,D −→ V ∗
V ∗

h × Vh × Vh,D × X◦
(w, w, ϕ) (cid:55)−→ (w, w, ϕ, γ−w, [[γw]])

is surjective to conclude that every line of the above expression must vanish independently,
which implies –line by line– equations (4.4a), (4.4c), the second component of (4.4d), and
the ﬁrst component of (4.4e). The boundary condition (4.4b) is given and the remaining
two components of (4.4d) and (4.4e) are imposed strongly by the choice of function
spaces.

σ := min{σ, 1}.

5 Time domain estimates

For the timed-domain estimates, data and solutions will be assumed to be in spaces of
the form

+(X) := {ξ ∈ Ck−1(R; X) : ξ ≡ 0 in (−∞, 0), ξ(k) ∈ L1(R; X)},
W k

for k ≥ 1. We will also use the linear diﬀerential operator (cf. [14])

The stability bounds and semi-discrete error estimates obtained in the previous section
can be translated into the following time-domain results. Taking the second group of data
(4.1b) to be identically zero and setting

(θd, θd, λd, φd) = (Phu − u, γ(Phu − u) · ν, λ, φ),

Convolution Quadrature and time-stepping. Convolution Quadrature (CQ) was
developed by Christian Lubich in the late 80’s and early 90’s [19, 27, 28, 29] as a way
to approximate causal convolutions and convolution equations based on the knowledge of
the Laplace transform of the convolution kernel and time domain data.

Since then it has been enriched greatly by works like [34, 10, 18, 4, 5, 6, 7] and –due
to its stability properties, the advantage of requiring only Laplace-domain fundamental
solutions and the possibility to take damping eﬀects into account with relative ease – has
become one of the preferred tools for the numerical analysis and simulation of evolutionary
problems arising from wave propagation and diﬀusion. A thorough review of results and
properties of CQ applied to boundary integral equations can be found in [8], while [21]
gives a detailed explanation of the computational and algorithmic subtleties involved in
its implementation.

In the heart of every CQ implementation lies an ODE solver which determines its ana-
lytic and convergence properties and gives rise to diﬀerent families of CQ algorithms. We
will focus on BDF2 time-stepping for the analysis but will give numerical experiments for
both BDF2 and Trapezoidal Rule-based methods. The integral equations will be treated
numerically with CQ, while the Finite Element discretization of the elastic displacement
and electric potential will be discretized in time using BDF2 and TR time-steppers.

The key resut that will allow us to carry out all the time domain analysis using CQ
based tools –even if our computational implementation involves traditional time stepping
for the ﬁnite element discretization– is that this split treatment of diﬀerent parts of a
system is equivalent to the application of CQ globally, as long as the time stepping
method used for the FEM part coincides with the one giving rise to the CQ algorithm in
use (see [26, Proposition 12], [20]).

BDF2-CQ with a time step size κ and the semi-discrete approximation (vh, uh, ψh) can

6 Numerical experiments

In order to test the convergence results proven in the previous section, the formulation
was implemented using standard Lagrangian ﬁnite elements for the elastic and electric
ﬁelds and Galerkin boundary elements for the acoustic ﬁeld. We take Vh and Vh to be

17

continuous Pk ﬁnite elements on a triangular mesh of Ω−. On the inherited mesh on Γ,
we consider the space Xh of discontinuous piecewise Pk−1 and the space Yh of continuous
piecewise Pk functions.

About the implementation. One of the advantages of the formulation we propose
is that it lends itself to a highly modular implementation, in the sense that pre-existing
FEM code for piezoelectricity and BEM code for acoustics can be used to solve the coupled
problem in the frequency domain without any modiﬁcation. The only requirement is the
addition of a “discrete trace” which translates boundary FEM degrees of freedom into
BEM degrees of freedom. Formally, the structure of the discrete system (3.9) can be

where: (a) the ﬁnite element block FEM(s) contains sparse s-independent elastic stiﬀness,
material mass, piezoelectric, and electric stiﬀness-like matrices, the material mass matrix
being multiplied by s2 (see (3.8a) and (3.8b)); (b) the boundary element block BEM(s)
contains Galerkin discretizations of the operators of the Calder´on projector (see (3.8c));
(c) the sparse matrix (NΓ)h corresponds to the discretization of the bilinear form Vh×Yh (cid:51)
(uh, χh) (cid:55)→ (cid:104)uh · ν, χh(cid:105)Γ with added zero blocks for the interactions of all other spaces.
We note that the trace space for Vh is a vector-valued version of Yh, which means that,
apart from rearrangements of degrees of freedom (and possible changes of local polynomial
bases), the only matrix connecting the BEM and FEM codes is simple to implement.

In a similar way, the transition from Laplace domain to time domain can be done in a
modularly, either by implementing a CQ routine that inverts the full operator matrix,
or a time stepping routine where s is replaced with a discrete approximation of the
diﬀerentiation operator, or using a Schur complement strategy as was ﬁrst suggested in [3]
and outlined in [20] for a purely acoustic system or as in [22] for a coupled acoustic/elastic
problem. The latter approach, which results in a decoupling of the boundary integral part
of the system, is well suited for parallelization and was the chosen strategy for the following
numerical experiments.

Geometric setup and physical parameters.
In all the convergence studies (fre-
quency and time domain), the rectangle Ω− := (1, 3) × (1, 2) ⊂ R2 was used as the
piezoelectric domain. The double-indices used in our general presentation of tensor in the
piezoelectric domains will be reduced to a single index using the simple convention:

(1, 1) ↔ 1

(2, 2) ↔ 2

(1, 2) ↔ 3.

(By symmetry, the pair (2,1) can be avoided in the tensor representations.) We choose
the following constant Lam´e parameters, mass density, and acoustic speed of sound:

λ = 2, µ = 3,

ρ = 5,

c = 1.

In the acoustic domain, the cylindrical acoustic wave

was used. Right-hand sides are added to equations (3.1b) and (3.1c)

∇ · σ = ρΣs2u + f1

∇ · D = f2

so that (u, ψ) is a solution. Note that both f1 and f2 are independent of the frequency s,
due to the fact that we have chosen u to be an elastic plane wave. Boundary data for ψ
and transmission data in (3.1d)-(3.1e) are built so that the equations are satisﬁed.
The experiment was ran using k = 1, 2 for the Pk ﬁnite elements and Pk/Pk−1 bound-
ary elements. The acoustic wave was sampled in twenty random points in the exterior
of the piezoelectric domain and compared to the exact solution, using the maximum dis-
crepancy as the measure of the acoustic error Ev
h. For the elastic and electric unknowns
both L2(Ω−) and H 1(Ω−) errors were computed. Tables 1 and 2 as well as Figure 2 show
the outcome of the convergence tests.

Convergence studies in the time domain. Experiments were carried out using
matching time stepping (for the FEM part) and CQ (for the BEM part) based on both
Trapezoidal Rule and BDF2 for time evolution. The fully discrete method based on the
trapezoidal rule can analyzed in the same way as BDF2, using results from [4]. Note that
the only diﬀerence is the lack of knowledge of how the error constants depend on the time
variable.
Just as in the frequency domain case, the rectangle Ω− := (1, 3) × (1, 2) ⊂ R2 was

used as the piezoelectric domain where the elastic plane pressure wave

Analogously to the frequency domain experiments, right hand sides were added so that
(u, ψ) are solutions to the system and the appropriate Dirichlet data was sampled at the
boundary using Equations (2.3d). (2.3e), and (2.3g) to deﬁne the boundary data.

The experiment was ran using k = 1, 2 for the Pk ﬁnite elements and Pk/Pk−1 bound-
ary elements. The time step and mesh size were reﬁned simultaneously and the ﬁnal time
was t = 1.5. All errors are measured at the ﬁnal time: Ev
h,κ measures the maximum error
on twenty randomly chosen points in the exterior domain, while elastic and electric ﬁelds

and a pentagonal piezoelectric scatterer with mass density given by

ρ = 5 + 25e−(10|r|)2.

The remaining physical parameters of the solid were taken to be those deﬁned by (6.1)
and the entire solid/ﬂuid interface was taken as Dirichlet boundary, where a ground-
ing potential ψ ≡ 0 was imposed as boundary condition for all times. The simulation
was carried out using P2 Lagrangian ﬁnite elements and P2/P1 continuous/discontinuous
Galerkin boundary elements with Trapezoidal Rule-based time discretization using a time
step κ = 0.005. Figures 5 to 7 show snapshots of the process at diﬀerent times.

We have developed a well-posed integro-diﬀerential formulation for the interaction of
acoustic waves and piezoelectric scatterers with Lipschitz boundaries in the transient

regime. The formulation is geared towards a numerical implementation employing bound-
ary elements for the acoustic ﬁeld in the unbounded exterior domain and ﬁnite elements
for the elastic and electric ﬁelds inside of the bounded scatterer, and can be easily imple-
mented computationally building on existing FEM and BEM routines.

We have shown that the resulting stability bounds in the Laplace domain can be used
to give explicit time-domain error bounds when BDF2-CQ is used for time discretization,
resulting in a quasi-optimal in time scheme of order 2 for suﬃciently smooth problem
data. Numerical evidence strongly suggests that the Trapezoidal Rule based method has
the same optimal convergence order and in fact may have better numerical properties
such as a much shorter pre-asymptotic regime and smaller error constants than those for
BDF2.
