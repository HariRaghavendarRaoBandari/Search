Abstract: Fix a,b ∈ C, let LW (a,b) be the loop W (a,b) Lie algebra over C with basis {La ,i,Ib , j | a ,b ,i, j ∈ Z} and
relations [La ,i,Lb , j] = (a −b )La +b ,i+ j, [La ,i,Ib , j] = −(a +ba +b )Ia +b ,i+ j, [Ia ,i,Ib , j] = 0, where a ,b ,i, j ∈ Z. In this
paper, a formal distribution Lie algebra of LW (a,b) is constructed. Then the associated conformal algebra CLW (a,b)
is studied, where CLW (a,b) has a C[¶ ]-basis {Li,I j |i, j ∈ Z} with l -brackets [Li l L j] = (¶ + 2l )Li+ j, [Li l I j] =
(¶ + (1 − b)l )Ii+ j and [Ii l I j] = 0. In particular, we determine the conformal derivations and rank one conformal
modules of this conformal algebra. Finally, we study the central extensions and extensions of conformal modules.

Introduction

The notion of Lie conformal algebras was introduced by V. G. Kac as a formal language describing the singular part of
the operator product expansion in conformal ﬁeld theory. It is useful to research inﬁnite dimensional Lie algebras sat-
isfying the locality property. Recently, the structure theory and representation theory of some Lie conformal algebras
have been extensively studied in [1,8,19,21,22]. For example, ﬁnite irreducible conformal modules over the Virasoro
conformal algebra were determined in [3]. In addition, the conformal derivations and conformal modules of some
inﬁnite rank Lie conformal algebras were studied in [7, 11, 25]. However, there is little about the central extensions
and modules extensions of inﬁnite rank Lie conformal algebras. In this paper, we will investigate the structure theory
and representation theory of an inﬁnite rank Lie conformal algebra, called loop W (a,b) Lie conformal algebra, such
as rank one conformal modules, central extensions and modules extensions. We believe this article would play an
energetic role on the study of inﬁnite rank Lie conformal algebras.

It is well known that the Lie algebra W (a,b) is an important inﬁnite dimensional Lie algebra, whose theory plays

a crucial role in many areas of mathematics and physics. Fix a,b ∈ C, then W (a,b) =La ∈Z(CLa L CIa ) could be a

Lie algebra equipped with the following brackets:

[La ,Lb ] = (a − b )La +b ,

[La ,Ib ] = −(a + ba + b )Ia +b ,

[Ia ,Ib ] = 0,

for any a ,b ∈ Z. Obviously, we know that W (a,b) ≃ W ⋉ I(a,b), where W is the well-known centerless Virasoro and
I(a,b) is the tensor density module of W . The structure theory and representation theory of W (a,b) were developed
in [9, 10, 20]. Furthermore, W (a,b) turns out to be some famous Lie algebras for special values of a,b. For example,
W (0,0) is the well-known twisted Heisenberg-Virasoro algebra whose structure theory and Harish-Chandra modules
were investigated in [16, 18]. In addition, W (0, −1) is the W-algebra W(2,2) which was ﬁrst introduced and studied
in [27].

The loop W (a,b) Lie algebra LW (a,b) is deﬁned to be the tensor product of W (a,b) and the Laurent polynomial

algebra C[t,t−1], which is a Lie algebra with basis {La ,i,Ib , j |a , b , i, j ∈ Z} and Lie brackets given by

[La ,i,Lb , j] = (a − b )La +b ,i+ j,
[La ,i,Ib , j] = −(a + ba + b )Ia +b ,i+ j,
[Ia ,i,Ib , j] = 0,

for any a ,b ,i, j ∈ Z. The subalgebra spanned by {La ,i |a ,i ∈ Z} is actually isomorphic to the centerless loop-Virasoro
algebra, whose structure theory was studied in [23]. Furthermore, simple Harish-Chandra modules, intermediate series
modules, and Verma modules of the loop-Virasoro algebra were investigated in [10].

Inﬁnite rank Lie conformal algebras are important ingredients of Lie conformal algebras.

In this article, we
would like to study an inﬁnite rank Lie conformal algebra, namely, the loop W (a,b) Lie conformal algebra CLW (a,b)
(cf. (1.1)) for some a,b ∈ C. We construct the Lie conformal algebra CLW (a,b) by LW (a,b) in Section 3. As one can
see, it is a Lie conformal algebra with C[¶ ]-basis {Li,I j |i, j ∈ Z} and l -brackets

[Li l L j] = (¶ + 2l )Li+ j,

[Li l I j] = (¶ + (1 − b)l )Ii+ j,

[Ii l I j] = 0.

(1.1)

We should mention that CLW (a,b) contains many important conformal subalgebras. For example, the conformal
subalgebra CVir = C[¶ ]L0 is isomorphic to the well-known Virasoro conformal algebra and the conformal subalgebra

CW =Li∈Z C[¶ ]Li is isomorphic to the loop Virasoro Lie conformal algebra studied in [25]. Furthermore, we know

that CLW (0,0) is the loop Heisenberg-Virasoro Lie conformal algebra which was studied in [7]. In addition, [26]
constructed the W (a,b) Lie conformal algebra for some a,b and its conformal module of rank one. Therefore, we can
apply some results of these Lie conformal algebras.

Let us brieﬂy describe the structure of the article. In Section 2, we introduce some basic deﬁnitions and previous
results of Lie conformal algebras. In Section 3, on the one hand, we look for the condition such that F is a C[¶ ]-
module, on the other hand, we construct a formal distribution Lie algebra (LW (a,b),F) for a suitable family F of
pairwise local formal distributions. In Sections 4 and 5, we study conformal derivations and free nontrivial rank one
conformal modules of CLW (a,b). Finally, the central extensions and modules extensions of CLW (a,b) are classiﬁed
in Sections 6 and 7 respectively.

Throughout this paper, we denote by C, C∗, Z, Z+ the sets of complex numbers, nonzero complex numbers,

integers, nonnegative integers respectively. We assume that the indices i, j,k ∈ Z, unless otherwise stated.

2 Preliminaries

In this section, we summarize some deﬁnitions related to formal distribution Lie algebras and Lie conformal algebras
in [5, 13, 15].

Proposition 2.1. Let g be a Lie algebra. If (a(z),b(w)) is a local pair of g-valued formal distributions, the Fourier
coefﬁcients satisfy the following commutation relation on g:

[a(m),b(n)] = (cid:229)

j∈Z+(cid:0) m

j (cid:1)(a( j)b)(m+n− j),

where

a( j)b = a(w)( j)b(w) = Resz(z − w) j[a(z),b(w)],

is called the j-product of a(w) and b(w).

2

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let g be a Lie algebra. The l -bracket of two g-valued formal distributions is deﬁned by the C-bilinear
map

[·l ·] : g[[w,w−1]] ⊗ g[[w,w−1]] −→ g[[w,w−1]][[l ]]

with

[a(w) l b(w)] = F

l
z,w[a(z),b(w)],

where Fl

z,wa(z,w) = Reszel (z−w)a(z,w) is the formal Fourier transform.

Furthermore, one readily shows that the l -bracket is related to the j-product as follows:

[a l b] = (cid:229)

j∈Z+

l

j

j!

(a( j)b).

(2.1)

(2.2)

Deﬁnition 2.3. A Lie conformal algebra is a C[¶ ]-module A endowed with a linear map A ⊗ A → A[l ], a ⊗ b → [a l b],
called l -bracket, where l

is an indeterminate and A[l ] = C[l ] ⊗ A, subject to the following three axioms:

Con f ormal sesquilinearity :

[¶ a l b] = −l [a l b],

[a l

¶ b] = (¶ + l )[a l b];

Skew symmetry :

[a l b] = −[b −l −¶ a];

(2.3)

Jacobi identity :

[a l [b m c]] = [[a l b] l +m c] + [b m [a l c]].

Deﬁnition 2.4. A conformal module M over a Lie conformal algebra A is a C[¶ ]-module endowed with a l -action
A ⊗ M → M[l ] such that

(¶ a) l v = −l a l v,

a l (¶ v) = (¶ + l )a l v;

a l (b m v) − b m (a l v) = [a l b] l +m v.

Furthermore, if M is a free module of rank one over A, we call M a rank one conformal module over A.

Deﬁnition 2.5. A Lie conformal algebra A is Z-graded if A = ⊕i∈ZAi, where each Ai is a C[¶ ]-submodule and
[Ai l A j] ⊂ Ai+ j[l ] for any i, j ∈ Z.

Deﬁnition 2.6. Let V and W be two C[¶ ]-modules. A conformal linear map from V to W is a C-linear map f l
C[¶ ][l ] ⊗C[¶ ] W such that

: V −→

f l (¶ v) = (¶ + l )f l (v),

for v ∈ V .

Denote the space of conformal linear maps between C[¶ ]-modules V and W by Chom(V,W ).

Deﬁnition 2.7. Let A be a Lie conformal algebra. A conformal linear map Dl
derivation if

: A −→ A[l ] is called a conformal

Dl ([a m b]) = [(Dl a) l +m b] + [a m (Dl b)],

for all a,b,c ∈ A.

It can be easily veriﬁed that for any x ∈ A, the map adx, deﬁned by (adx)l y = [x l y] for y ∈ A, is a conformal
derivation of A. All conformal derivations of this kind are called conformal inner derivations. Denote by CDer (A) and
CInn (A) the vector spaces of all conformal derivations and conformal inner derivations of A respectively.

3 The Lie conformal algebra CLW (a, b)

In this section, we would like to start with the Lie algebra LW (a,b) to construct the Lie conformal algebra CLW (a,b)
via formal distribution Lie algebra. Let F be a vector space spanned by {Li(z), I j(z) |i, j ∈ Z}, where Li(z) =
a ∈Z La ,iz−a −2 and I j(z) = (cid:229)

b ∈Z Ib , jz−b −x for any i, j ∈ Z and some x ∈ Z.

According to the resultof the W (a,b) Lie conformal algebra studied in [26], we can get Proposition 3.1 similarly.

Proposition 3.1. F is a C[¶ ]-module if and only if x = a − b + 1.

By Proposition 3.1, we can obtain that if and only if a − b ∈ Z, there exists the Lie conformal algebra CLW (a,b).

Moreover, we have propositions as follows.

Proposition 3.2. If a − b ∈ Z, then we have I j(z) = (cid:229)

b ∈Z Ib , jz−b −a+b−1. Also, we have

[Li(z),L j(w)] = (¶ wLi+ j(w))d (z,w) + 2Li+ j(w)¶ wd (z,w),
[Li(z),I j(w)] = (¶ wIi+ j(w))d (z,w) + (1 − b)Ii+ j(w)¶ wd (z,w),
[Ii(z),I j(w)] = 0.

Proposition 3.3. If a − b ∈ Z, then we have

[Li l L j] = (¶ + 2l )Li+ j,

[Li l I j] = (¶ + (1 − b)l )Ii+ j,

[Ii l I j] = 0.

(3.1)

Proposition 3.4. Let CLW (a,b) be a free C[¶ ]-module with C[¶ ]-basis {Li,Ii | i, j ∈ Z} and a −b ∈ Z. Then CLW (a,b)
is a Lie conformal algebra with l -brackets deﬁned as in Proposition 3.3.

For convenience, we simply denote R(b) = CLW (a,b). Note that R(b) is a Z-graded Lie conformal algebra in the
sense R(b) = ⊕i∈Z (R(b))i, where (R(b))i = C[¶ ]Li ⊕ C[¶ ]Ii. Obviously, R(0) is the loop Heisenberg-Virasoro Lie
conformal algebra studied in [7].

4 Conformal derivations of CLW (a, b)

Suppose D ∈ CDer (R(b)). Deﬁne Di(L j) = p i+ jD(L j), Di(I j) = p i+ jD(I j) for any j ∈ Z, where in general p i is the
natural projection from

C[l ] ⊗ R(b) ∼= ⊕ j∈ZC[¶ ,l ]L j ⊕ ⊕ j∈ZC[¶ ,l ]I j,

onto C[¶ ,l ]Li ⊕ C[¶ ,l ]Ii. Then Di is a conformal derivation and D = (cid:229)
ﬁnitely many Dil (x) 6= 0. Let (CDer (R(b)))c be the space of conformal derivations of degree c, i.e.,

i∈Z Di in the sense that for any x ∈ R(b) only

(CDer (R(b)))c = {D ∈ CDer (R(b)) |Dl ((R(b))i) ⊂ (R(b))i+c[l ]}.

Firstly, by [7], we have the following theorem.

Theorem 4.1. CDer (R(0)) = CInn (R(0)) ⊕ C

.

For readers’ convenience, the deﬁnition of C

is given. Denote

C

= {~a = (ac)c∈Z |ac ∈ C and ac = 0 for all but ﬁnitely many c′s}.

For each ~a ∈ C
easily veriﬁed that D~a ∈ CInn (R(0)) implies D~a = 0. For simplicity, we denote by C
derivations.

, we deﬁne D~a l (Li) = (cid:229) acIi+c and D~a l (Ii) = 0 for all i ∈ Z. Then D~a ∈ CDer (R(0)). It can be
the space of such conformal

Methods similar to those in the article [7] are used to discuss nonzero parameter b. As a result, we obtain the

following theorem.

Theorem 4.2. If b ∈ C∗, we have CDer (R(b)) = CInn (R(b)).

Now we get the main result of this section.

Theorem 4.3. CDer (R(b)) = CInn (R(b)) ⊕ d b,0C

.

5 Rank one conformal modules over CLW (a, b)

Now suppose M is a free conformal module of rank one over R(b). We write M = C[¶ ]v and assume Li l v = fi(¶ ,l )v,
I j l v = g j(¶ ,l )v, where fi(¶ ,l ),g j(¶ ,l ) ∈ C[¶ ,l ]. We will compute the coefﬁcients fi(¶ ,l ),g j(¶ ,l ).

Firstly, according to [25], we have Lemma 5.1.

Lemma 5.1. There exist D

,a ,c ∈ C such that fi(¶ ,l ) = ci(¶ + D

l + a ) for any i ∈ Z.

Using the similar method of [7], we conclude the following lemma.

Lemma 5.2. gi(¶ ,l ) = d b,0dci where c,d ∈ C, i ∈ Z.

From above discussions, we obtain the main result of this section.

Theorem 5.3. A nontrivial free conformal module of rank one over R(b) is isomorphic to M(D
,a ,d ∈ C,c ∈ C∗, where M(D

,a ,c,d) = C[¶ ]v and l -actions are given by

,a ,c,d) for some

Li l v = ci(¶ + D

l + a )v, Ii l v = d b,0dciv.

Furthermore, M(D

,a ,c,d) is irreducible if and only if D

6= 0.

6 The central extensions of CLW (a, b)

In this section, we shall consider the central extensions of R(b).

An extension of a Lie conformal algebra R by an abelian Lie conformal algebra G is a short exact sequence of Lie

conformal algebra

0 → G →bR → R → 0.

That is to say,bR is called an extension of R by G. This extension is said to be central if
G ⊂ Z(bR) = {x ∈bR | [x l y] = 0, ∀ y ∈bR}, ¶ G = 0.
LetbR be a central extension of R by a one-dimensional center Cc. This means thatbR ∼= RL Cc as vector spaces, and

[a l b]bR = [a l b]R + f l (a,b)c,

5

¥
¥
¥
D
where f l

: R × R → C[l ] is a bilinear map. It follows from the axioms of Lie conformal algebra that f l satisfy:

−¶ −l (b,a);

f l (a,b) = −f
f l (¶ a,b) = −lf
f l +m ([a l b],c) = f l (a, [b m c]) − f m (b, [a l c]);

l (a,b) = −f l (a,¶ b);

(6.1)

for all a,b,c ∈ R. The map f l satisfying (6.1) is called a 2-cocycle of R.

and the l -brackets (3.1) are replaced by

Now we will compute the central extension dR(b) of R(b) by a one-dimensional center Cc, i.e., dR(b) = R(b) ⊕ Cc,

[Li l L j] = (¶ + 2l )Li+ j + Al (Li,L j)c,
[Li l I j] = (¶ + (1 − b)l )Ii+ j + Bl (Li,I j)c,
[Ii l I j] = Cl (Ii,I j)c,

where Al ,Bl ,Cl

: R(b) ⊗ R(b) → C[l ] are bilinear maps.

In the following, our main work is to determine Al (Li,L j),Bl (Li,I j) and Cl (Ii,I j).
Firstly, according to the conclusion of [12], we have the following equality

Al (Li,L j) = A(i + j)l + A′(i + j)l 3,

(6.2)

where A and A′ are complex functions.

Next we apply the Jacobi identity to (Li,L j,Ik), and one has

(l − m )Bl +m (Li+ j,Ik) = (l + (1 − b)m )Bl (Li,I j+k) − (m + (1 − b)l )Bm (L j,Ii+k).

(6.3)

We denote Bl (Li,I j) = (cid:229) n

m=0 bm(Li,I j)l m ∈ C[l ] with bn(Li,I j) 6= 0. Then we get

(l − m )

n(cid:229)

m=0

bm(Li+ j,Ik)(l + m )m = (l + (1 − b)m )

n(cid:229)

m=0

bm(Li,I j+k)l m − (m + (1 − b)l )

n(cid:229)

m=0

bm(L j,Ii+k)m m.(6.4)

By using the similar methods of computing Al (Li,L j), one can deduce that

b0(L j,Ik) = 0, b1(L j,Ik) = B(i + j),
b2(L j,Ik) = d b,0B′(i + j), b3(L j,Ik) = d b,−1B′′(i + j)

where B, B′ and B′′ are complex functions.

It is easily veriﬁed that bm(Li,I j) = 0 for m > 3.
Therefore, we have

Bl (Li,I j) = B(i + j)l + d b,0B′(i + j)l 2 + d b,−1B′′(i + j)l 3.

Applying the Jacobi identity to (Li,I j,Ik) and comparing the coefﬁcients of l

im

j, we show that

Cl (Ii,I j) = d b,0C(i + j)l .

where C is a complex function.

Finally, from above discussions, we obtain the main result of this section.

6

(6.5)

(6.6)

Theorem 6.1. The one-dimensional central extension dR(b) of R(b) has the following form:

[Li l L j] = (¶ + 2l )Li+ j + (A(i + j)l + A′(i + j)l 3)c,
[Li l I j] = (¶ + (1 − b)l )Ii+ j + (B(i + j)l + d b,0B′(i + j)l 2 + d b,−1B′′(i + j)l 3)c,
[Ii l I j] = d b,0C(i + j)l c,

where A, A′, B, B′, B′′ and C are complex functions.

In particular, we have the one-dimensional central extension of loop Heisenberg-Virasoro Lie conformal algebra

studied in [7]

[Li l L j] = (¶ + 2l )Li+ j + (A(i + j)l + A′(i + j)l 3)c,
[Li l I j] = (¶ + l )Ii+ j + (B(i + j)l + B′(i + j)l 2)c,
[Ii l I j] = C(i + j)l c.

7 The extensions of conformal modules

Above all we review some deﬁnitions about extensions of conformal modules.

For two conformal modules V and W over a Lie conformal algebra R, an extension E of W by V is a module over

R which satisﬁes an exact sequence

0 → V → E → W → 0,

Clearly, an extension can be regarded as the direct sum of vector spaces E = V ⊕W , where V is a submodule of

E, while for w in W we can obtain

a·w = aw + f a(w), a ∈ R,

where f a : W → V is a linear map satisfying the cocycle condition: f
[a,b](w) = f a(bw) + af b(w) − f b(aw) − bf a(w),
b ∈ R. The set of these cocycles forms a vector space over C. Cocycles corresponding to the trivial extension are
called trivial cocycles. The dimension of the quotient space is called the dimension of the space of extensions of W by
V . The quotient space is denoted by Ext(W,V ).

By Theorem 5.3, we have a nontrivial free conformal module M(D

,a ,c,d) = C[¶ ]v of rank one over R(b) with

l -actions given by

Li l v = ci(¶ + D

l + a )v, Ii l v = d b,0dciv.

We ﬁrst consider extensions of R(b)-modules of the form

0 −→ Cb −→ E −→ M(D

,a ,c,d) −→ 0,

where Cb = Cvb denotes the 1-dimensional vector space over C on which we have an action of R(b) deﬁned by

Then we have E = C[¶ ]v ⊕ Cb and l -action deﬁned by

Ll vb = Il vb = 0,

¶ vb = b vb .

Li l vb = Ii l vb = 0,
Li l v = ci(¶ + D
Ii l v = d b,0dciv + gi(l )vb ,

l + a )v + fi(l )vb ,

7

(7.1)

where fi(l ),gi(l ) ∈ C[l ].

According to [24], we have the following two lemmas. Since [24] is a doctor dissertation, for readers’ con-
venience, we supply an outline of the proof. Firstly, from the deﬁnition of the conformal module, we can get the
following equality

(l − m ) fi+ j(l + m ) = c j(a + b + l + D

m ) fi(l ) − ci(a + b + D
Letting i = j = m = 0 and i = m = 0 in (7.2), it follows that Lemma 7.1 holds.
At the same time, using the similar method of [4], we conclude Lemma 7.2.

l + m ) f j(m ).

(7.2)

Lemma 7.1. If a + b
Lemma 7.2. If a + b = 0, one has

6= 0, then fi(l ) = 0.

where e ∈ C.

fi(l ) =

if D = 1,
if D = 2,
otherwise.

Next we would like to investigate gi(l ).

Lemma 7.3. For any i, j ∈ Z,

(bl + m )gi+ j(l + m ) = ci(a + b + D

l + m )g j(m ) − d b,0dc j fi(l ).

(7.3)

Proof. A direct computation shows that

[Li l I j] l +m v = ((¶ + (1 − b)l )Ii+ j)l +m v

= −(bl + m )gi+ j(l + m )vb

(mod C[¶ ,l , m ]v),

[Li l I j] l +m v = Li l (I j m v) − I j m (Li l v)

= (d b,0dc j fi(l ) − ci(a + b + D

l + m )g j(m ))vb

(mod C[¶ ,l , m ]v).

Thus, the lemma holds.

Lemma 7.4. If a + b
6= 0, then gi(l ) = 0.
Proof. Letting l = i = 0 in (7.3), we obtain

m g j(m ) = (a + b + m )g j(m ).

(7.4)

Due to a + b

6= 0, we have g j(m ) = 0.

This completes the proof.

Lemma 7.5. If a + b = 0 and b 6= 0, then

where r ∈ C.

gi(l ) =(rci,

0,

if D = b,
otherwise.

8

Proof. If a + b = 0 and b 6= 0, then (7.3) can be rewritten by

Letting i = j = 0 in (7.5), one has

(bl + m )gi+ j(l + m ) = ci(D

l + m )g j(m ).

(bl + m )g0(l + m ) = (D

l + m )g0(m ).

If D

6= b, it can be easily seen that g0(m ) = 0.
Letting m = j = 0 in (7.5), it follows that

bgi(l ) = ciD g0(0).

Therefore, we have gi(l ) = 0.

If D = b in (7.7), we have gi(l ) = rci with r = g0(0).
So we have completed the proof.

Lemma 7.6. If a + b = b = 0, we obtain

gi(l ) =(cil ,

0,

if D = 1, d = 0,
otherwise.

Proof. If b = 0, according to

0 = [Ii l I j] l +m v

= [Ii l I j] l +m v = Ii l (I j m v) − I j m (Ii l v)
= d2ci+ j(gi(l ) − g j(m ))vb

(mod C[¶ ,l , m ]v),

then we have d2ci+ j(gi(l ) − g j(m )) = 0.

If c,d ∈ C∗, then gi(l ) is a constant for any i ∈ Z. Thanks to (7.3), we at once deduce gi(l ) = 0.
If a + b = b = d = 0, then (7.3) becomes

Setting i = j = 0 in (7.8), we obtain

m gi+ j(l + m ) = ci(D

l + m )g j(m ).

m g0(l + m ) = (D

l + m )g0(m ).

6= 1, it shows that gi(l ) = 0. If D = 1, we get gi(l ) = cil .

If D
Therefore, we have proved the lemma.

Finally, we can easily obtain the following two theorems.

Theorem 7.7. If b,c ∈ C∗, one can deduce that

Theorem 7.8. If b = 0,c ∈ C∗, one follows

dim Ext(M(D

if a + b = d = 0, D = −1 or 2,
if a + b = d = 0, D = 1,
otherwise.

Next we will compute Ext(Cb ,M(D

,a ,c,d)), i.e., the extension of Cb by M(D

,a ,c,d):

0 −→ M(D

,a ,c,d) −→ E −→ Cb −→ 0,

we have E = C[¶ ]v ⊕ Cb , where C[¶ ]v ∼= M(D

,a ,c,d) is a conformal submodule, and

¶ vb = b vb + r (¶ )v,
Li l vb = hi(¶ ,l )v,
Ii l vb = li(¶ ,l )v,

where r (¶ ) ∈ C[¶ ],hi(¶ ,l ),li(¶ ,l ) ∈ C[¶ ,l ].

According to [24], we have the following lemma.

Lemma 7.9.

where s = r (¶ ) ∈ C.

hi(¶ ,l ) =(sci,

0,

if a + b = 0, D = 1,
otherwise,

Note from Ii l (¶ vb ) = (¶ + l )li(¶ ,l )v, we get

(¶ + l )li(¶ ,l ) = b li(¶ ,l ) + r (¶ + l )d b,0dci.

(7.10)

If b 6= 0, by comparing the highest degree of ¶

in (7.10), we have li(¶ ,l ) = 0.

Lemma 7.10. If b = 0, one shows that li(¶ ,l ) = 0.

Proof. Firstly, using

0 = [Ii l I j] l +m vb = Ii l (I j m vb ) − I j m (Ii l vb )

= l j(¶ + l , m )li(¶ ,l ) − li(¶ + m ,l )l j(¶ , m ),

we conclude that

l j(¶ + l , m )li(¶ ,l ) = li(¶ + m ,l )l j(¶ , m ).

By comparing the highest degree of l

in both sides of (7.11), we conclude that

li(¶ ,l ) = li(l ).

(7.11)

(7.12)

By

we obtain

[Li l I j] l +m vb = −(bl + m )li+ j(¶ ,l + m )v.

[Li l I j] l +m vb = Li l (I j m vb ) − I j m (Li l vb )

= ci(¶ + D

l + a )l j(¶ + l , m ) − d b,0dcili(¶ + m ,l )v,

−(bl + m )li+ j(¶ ,l + m ) = ci(¶ + D

l + a )l j(¶ + l , m ) − d b,0dcili(¶ + m ,l ).

(7.13)

If b = 0, according to (7.12), then (7.13) can be rephrased by

−m li+ j(l + m ) = ci(¶ + D

l + a )l j(m ) − dcili(l ).

(7.14)

Comparing the degree of ¶

in (7.14), we obtain li(¶ ,l ) = li(l ) = 0.

Hence, the proof is ﬁnished.

Finally, we get the following theorem.

Theorem 7.11. If c ∈ C∗, we have

dim Ext(Cb ,M(D

,a ,c,d)) =(1,

0,

if a + b = 0, D = 1,
otherwise.
