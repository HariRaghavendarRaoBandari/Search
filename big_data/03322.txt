Abstract

The eigenstates of tetraquarks of type su ¯d¯b with JP = 0+ are calculated within a simple quark

model with chromomagnetic interaction and eﬀective quark masses extracted from meson and

baryon spectra. It is tempting to see if this spectrum can accommodate the new narrow structure

X(5568), observed by the DØ Collaboration and thought to be a tetraquark with four diﬀerent

ﬂavors. The calculated mass agrees with the experimental value. However we are aware of the

diﬃculty of extracting eﬀective quark masses, from mesons and baryons, to be used in multiquark

systems.

INTRODUCTION

The DØ Collaboration [1], has recently observed a narrow structure named X(5568) in

the B0

s π± invariant mass spectrum with 5.1σ signiﬁcance.

Its measured mass and width

are M = 5567.8 ± 2.9(stat)+0.9

−1.9(syst) MeV and Γ = 21.9 ± 6.4(stat)+5.0

tively. Its decay into the ﬁnal state B0

−2.5(syst) MeV, respec-
s π± suggests that X(5568) could be a su¯b ¯d (or sd¯b¯u)
tetraquark with four diﬀerent ﬂavors, among which one is heavy. The DØ Collaboration
s π+ produced in an S wave, the quantum numbers of X(5568) should
be J P = 0+ and that the resonance may be the heavy analogue of the isotriplet scalar a(980)

suggests that, with B0

with an s quark replaced by a b quark.

An advantage of studying a tetraquark with four diﬀerent ﬂavors is that there are not

annihilation processes like in c¯cq ¯q systems (q = u, d, s). These are diﬃcult to deal with

theoretically.

The present observation immediately stimulated theoretical interest. So far, approaches

based on QCD sum rules [2–9] quark models [10, 11] or rescattering eﬀects [12] have been

adopted. An SU(3) classiﬁcation has also been considered [13]. In [2–4] scalar tetraquarks

were studied while Ref.

[6] considered both scalar and axial tetraquark. Ref.

[8] strongly

supports a scalar nature for X(5568) by reproducing its decay width.

An incentive to studying tetraquarks can be found in a recent paper by Weinberg [14]

based on large Nc QCD. It is quite natural to inquire about the existence of exotics at large

Nc inasmuch as the 1/Nc expansion method proposed by ’t Hooft [15] has been very succesful

for ordinary hadrons. According to Weinberg exotic mesons consisting of two quarks and

two antiquarks are not ruled out in large Nc QCD. The real question is the decay rate of

a tetraquark. The suggestion has been considered in subsequent papers as, for example, in

Refs. [16–19].

For simplicity, in this work, we use the schematic model of Refs.

[20, 21] based on the

chromomagnetic interaction between quarks (antiquarks). In Ref.

[20] it was shown that

X(3872) can be interpreted as a c¯cq ¯q tetraquark where the lowest 1++ state has a dominant

color octet-octet component (0.9997) and a very small color singlet-singlet component (0.026)

which may explain why this state decays with a very small width into J/ψ + ρ or J/ψ + ω,

in agreement with the experimental value for the total width Γ < 2.3 MeV of X(3782)

[22]. The analysis has been extended to 0++ and 2++ sectors and the problem of extraction

2

the chromomagnetic strength from meson and baryons to be used in tetraquarks has been

extensively discussed in Ref.

[21]. The study of the entire spectrum of the c¯cs¯s system

in view of the analysis of the Y(4140) resonance has been later performed in Ref.

[23]

within the same model. The suggestion was that Y(4140) could be the strange partner of

X(3782), because the corresponding wave function also has a very small color singlet-singlet

component which may explain a narrow width in the J/ψ + φ channel. The model of Refs.

[20, 21] has also been considered in Ref. [24].

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we introduce the quark model used in this

study.

identiﬁed with B0

In Sec. III we recall the basis states in the direct meson-meson channel which is
s π±. In Sec. IV we present the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian for
J P = 0+ states. In Sec. V we exhibit the eigenvalues and eigenstates resulting from the

diagonalization of the matrix obtained for the chromomagnetic interaction and discuss the

features of the eigenstates. The last section is devoted to conclusions.

II. THE MODEL

This note is based on the simple model of Refs.

[20, 21] which can reveal the gross

features of a tetraquark, especially the structure of the wave functions.

In the next section we introduce the relevant basis states in the color-spin space, including

both the color singlet-singlet and the octet-octet channels, the latter being called hidden

color channels. There are no correlated quarks or diquarks, as in the diquark-antidiquark

picture [25, 26].

According to Refs. [20, 21] the mass of a tetraquark is given by the expectation value of

the eﬀective Hamiltonian

where

H = Xi

mi + HCM,

HCM = −Xi,j

Cij λc

i · λc

j ~σi · ~σj .

(1)

(2)

The ﬁrst term in Eq. (1) contains the eﬀective masses mi as parameters. The constants Cij

represent integrals in the orbital space of some unspeciﬁed radial forms of the chromomag-

netic part of the one gluon-exchange interaction potential and of the wave functions.

A warning should be given to the way of determining the eﬀective masses mi to be used

3

for multiquark systems. Besides the kinetic energy contribution, they incorporate the eﬀect

of the conﬁnement, which is still an open problem [27]. Information from lattice calculations

on tetraquarks (see i. e. [28, 29]) may lead to a better understanding of the eﬀective masses

to be used in simple models.

Presently, we use the compromise proposed in Refs. [20, 21] for mq and ms, while for mb

we rely on a value compatible with heavy-light systems [30]. Therefore we have

mu,d = 320 MeV, ms = 590 MeV, mb = 4860 MeV.

(3)

Due to the arbitrariness in the choice of eﬀective masses of quarks, precise estimates of the

absolute values of tetraquark masses is diﬃcult to make. One can have an approximate idea

about the range where the spectrum should be located. However, the relative distances be-

tween the eigenstates obtained from the chromomagnetic Hamiltonian (2) and the structure

of its eigenstates do not depend on the eﬀective masses, which is important for exploring

the strong decay properties.

The parameters Cij have presently been taken from Ref. [21] where a more complete list

is given. The chosen values are

Cu ¯d = 29.8 MeV, Cs ¯d = 18.4 MeV, Cus = 13 MeV,

Cu¯b = 2.1 MeV, C ¯d¯b = 1.9 MeV, Cs¯b = 2.2 MeV.

(4)

We should mention that the above parameters were extracted from a global ﬁt to meson and

baryon ground states. As one can infer from these values, most of the hyperﬁne attraction

will come from light qq or q ¯q pairs, as expected.

We do not intend to make a ﬁne tuning of the eﬀective masses. We are mostly interested

in the structure of the tetraquark wave functions which essentially depends on the hyperﬁne

interaction. We shall compare the calculated spectrum to the experimental thresholds.

III. THE BASIS STATES

Here we use a basis vectors relevant for understanding the decay properties of tetraquarks.

The total wave function of a tetraquark is a linear combination of these basis vectors. We

suppose that particles 1 and 2 are quarks and particles 3 and 4 are antiquarks, see Fig. 1.

Presently we take 1 = u, 2 = s, 3 = d and 4 = b.

FIG. 1: Three independent relative coordinate systems. Solid and open circles represent quarks

and antiquarks respectively: (a) diquark-antidiquark channel, (b) direct meson-meson channel, (c)

exchange meson-meson channel.

In principle the basis vectors should contain the orbital, color, ﬂavor and spin degrees

of freedom such as to account for the Pauli principle. But, as we consider ℓ = 0 states

the orbital part is symmetric and anyhow irrelevant for the eﬀective Hamiltonian described

in the previous section. Moreover, as the ﬂavor operators do not explicitly appear in the

Hamiltonian, the ﬂavor part does not need to be speciﬁed. A detailed description of the

three distinct bases corresponding to the three choices of internal coordinates shown in Fig.

1 was presented in Refs. [31, 32].

We remind that in the color space there are three distinct bases: a) |312334i, |612634i,

b) |113124i,

|813824i , and c) |114123i,

|814823i, associated to the three distinct internal

coordinate systems shown in Fig. 1. The 3 and 3 are antisymmetric and 6 and 6 are

symmetric under interchange of quarks and antiquarks respectively. This basis is convenient

for diquark-antidiquark models, where the color space is truncated to contain only |312334i

states [25, 26]. The sets b) and c) both contain a color singlet-singlet and a color octet-

octet state. The amplitude of the latter vanishes asymptotically, when the mesons, into

which a tetraquark decays, separate. These are called hidden color states by analogy to

states which appear in the nucleon-nucleon problem, deﬁned as a six-quark system [33].

The contribution of hidden color states to the binding energy of light tetraquarks has been

calculated explicitly in Ref.

[31]. The coordinate sets b) and c) deﬁne the direct and the

exchange meson-meson channels.

As the quarks and antiquarks are spin 1/2 particles the total spin of a tetraquark can be

S = 0 , S = 1 or S = 2. Here we discuss at length the S = 0 spectrum and only mention

5

the lowest S = 1 state at the end of Sec. V.

For S = 0 there are two independent basis states (two Young tableaux) for each channel.

The spin states associated to the three distinct internal coordinates depicted in Fig. 1 are:

a) |S12S34i,

| ~A12 · ~A34i, b) |P13P24i,

|(V13V24)0i , c) |P14P23i,

|(V14V23)0i, respectively,

where S stands for scalar, A for axial and P and V for pseudoscalar and vector subsystems

and the lower index 0 indicates the total spin. The relation between the three diﬀerent bases

can be found in Ref.

[32].

IV. MATRIX ELEMENTS

As already stressed, the Hamiltonian (1) does not contain ﬂavor operators so that the

ﬂavor part of the wave function does not need to be speciﬁed. Then the quantum numbers

of the states can be deﬁned in terms of the permutation properties of the spin and color

parts of the basis vectors, as shown in Ref.

[34]. The charge conjugation becomes a good

quantum number for the basis vectors (see Appendix A). Accordingly, for two identical

ﬂavors, a ground state tetraquark can have J P C = 0++, 1++, 1+− and 2++. For four distinct

ﬂavors the situation is more complicated.

In the direct meson-meson channel, in each case a basis can be built with the quark-

antiquark pairs (1,3) and (2,4) as subsystems, where each subsystem has a well deﬁned color

state, a singlet-singlet or an octet-octet. The other quark-antiquark pairs, (1,4) and (2,3)

are needed to study the meson-meson exchange channels (see Fig. 1c). One can ﬁx a basis

in terms of the problem one looks at, but for convenience, in the calculations one can pass

from one basis to another by an orthogonal transformation. In this study the adequate basis

is that related to the direct meson-meson channel, depicted in Fig. 1b.

To study the J P = 0+ spectrum we can use the J P C = 0++ basis constructed from

products of color and spin states associated to Fig. 1b are

ψ1

0++ = |113124P13P24i, ψ2

0++ = |113124(V13V24)0i,

ψ3

0++ = |813824P13P24i, ψ4

0++ = |813824(V13V24)0i.

The chromomagnetic interaction Hamiltonian with minus sign, -HCM, acting on this

basis leads to the following symmetric matrix

In the case of two distinct ﬂavors, for example s¯sc¯c systems, the following equalities hold

C14 = C23, C12 = C34,

(7)

in which case the above matrix takes a simpler form, to be found in Ref. [23]. Note that the

matrix element row 1 column 4 of -HCM has a correct - sign, a misprint has to be corrected

in Ref. [23].

We also note that the above matrix can be used in any quark model containing a chro-

momagnetic interaction.

In that case the coeﬃcients Cij should be replaced by integrals

containing the chosen form factor of the chromomagnetic interaction and the orbital wave

functions of the model.

V. THE JP = 0+ STATES OF su ¯d¯b

The calculated spectrum is exhibited in Table I. One can see that the choice of the eﬀective

masses (3) and of the hyperﬁne interaction parameters (4) is quite adequate, giving for the

lowest state a mass of 5530 MeV, close to the experiment, with a hyperﬁne contribution of

- 560 MeV. In the basis (5) the lowest state has the amplitudes given in row 1.

The ﬁrst number c1 implies that this state can decay substantially into a PP channel, i.

e. B0

the VV channel B0∗

s + π± (threshold 5506 MeV). The second number c2 indicates a negligible coupling to
s + ρ± which is consistent with the experiment. The third and fourth
numbers show the hidden-color content of the lowest state. These numbers should decrease

asymptotically when the two quark-antiquark pairs separate. As the PP channel component

of the lowest eigenstate is quite large it must be another reason to produce a narrow width,

contrary to the case of X(3872) where a tiny VV channel component was a reason to explain

its narrow width into J/ψ + ρ or J/ψ + ω [20]. The phase-space could be an important

factor or any other unknown mechanism.

Actually one can understand the reason why the two cases are so diﬀerent. In the matrix

produced by the chromomagnetic interaction for the 1++ case the key quantity was the oﬀ-

diagonal matrix element C23 − C12 ≡ Cq¯c − Cqc = 1.5 MeV which is very small, so there is no

much coupling between the only color singlet-singlet and the only hidden color states. Then

the amplitude of this VV channel is negligible and the hidden color part, which does not

decay, is dominant. Combined with the phase space of the decay of X(3872) into J/ψ + ρ

or J/ψ + ω the lowest 1++ acquires a very small width. An analogue situation occurs for

Y(4140) where C23 − C12 ≡ Cs¯c − Csc = 1.7 MeV is also very small [23].

In the present case there is no such tiny oﬀ-diagonal matrix element, which one can infer

from the deﬁnitions of these elements and the values of Cij given in Eq.(4).

On the other hand, there is a large phenomenological diﬀerence between X(3872) and

X(5568). While X(3872) is located only a few MeV below the DD

∗

threshold, the X(5568)

resonance is quite far below the B0

s + π± threshold. This implies that X(5568) could be a

more compact system, therefore a better candidate for tetraquarks.

One can also introduce the exchange channel. The corresponding amplitudes can in

principle be obtained from the orthogonal transformation going from the direct meson-meson

channel, Fig. 1b, to the exchange meson-meson channel, Fig. 1c.

Looking at Fig. 1c and recalling that we chose 1 = u, 2 = s, 3 = d and 4 = b, for the

exchange meson-meson channels we obtain

ψ1ex

0+ = |114123i|P14P23i = B+K

0

ψ2ex

0+ = |114123i|(V14V23)0i = B+∗K

0∗

The orthogonal transformation between the direct and exchange channel bases can be found

in Appendix A of Ref.

[23]. But the tetraquark state X(5568) can hardly decay into the

exchange channel B+K

0

, the threshold being too far, at 5777 MeV.

In addition we have also calculated the spectrum of J P = 1+ and found that the lowest

state has a mass of 5614 MeV, i.e. it lies 84 MeV above the lowest 0+ state. Therefore the

scalar and the axial tetraquarks are not degenerate in the present model, at variance with

the result of Ref.

[10] where they are almost degenerate. The lowest 1+ state can partly

decay into B ∗

s +π being at 59 MeV above the threshold of 5555 MeV.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have presented results in a simple tetraquark model to see whether or

not this model is compatible with the observation of the X(5568) resonance. The param-

eters of the model were deduced from meson and baryon masses. The calculated mass of

X(5568) so obtained is in agreement with the experimental mass range. The structure of

the corresponding wave function indicates a large component in the B0

s π+ channel.

A more elaborate study of the su ¯d¯b tetraquark system is worth by itself. The tetraquarks

containing four diﬀerent ﬂavors may be more diﬃcult to study than those with one light

and one heavy ﬂavor. It may be a long way before understanding them, if conﬁrmed. In

fact, the LHCb Collaboration did not see a signal for X(5568) in the preliminary analysis of

pp collisions reported at the Moriond meeting, March 19-26, 2016 [36].

Appendix A: Charge conjugation

From Ref.

[35] Ch. 10, one can see that the permutation (13)(24) leaves invariant the

color basis vectors |113124i and |813824i. Then, with the identiﬁcation 1 = u, 2 = s, 3 = d

and 4 = b the permutation (13)(24) is equivalent to the charge conjugation operator [34].

9

Thus all basis states introduced in this way have a deﬁnite charge conjugation, which is easy

to identify.
