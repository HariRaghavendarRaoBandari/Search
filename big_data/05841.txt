Abstract

This paper studies the competition of fracture initiation mechanisms in a two-phase material that comprises
a ductile soft phase and a hard phase which is comparatively brittle. A simple microstructural model is used
to predict macroscopic fracture initiation. The simplicity of the model ensures highly eﬃcient computations,
enabling an comprehensive study: a large range of hard phase volume fractions and yield stress ratios, for wide
range of applied stress states. Each combination of these parameters is analyzed using a large set of (random)
microstructures. It is observed that only one of the phases dominates macroscopic fracture initiation: at low
stress triaxiality the soft phase, but above a critical triaxiality the hard phase takes over resulting in a
strong decrease in ductility. This transition is strongly dependent on microstructural parameters.
If the
hard phase volume fraction is small, the fracture initiation is dominated by the soft phase even at high phase
contrast. At higher hard phase volume fraction, the hard phase dominates already at low phase contrast. This
simple model thereby reconciles experimental observations from the literature for a speciﬁc combination of
parameters, which may have triggered contradictory statements in the past. A microscopic analysis reveals
that the average phase distribution around fracture initiation sites is nearly the same for the two failure
mechanisms. Along the tensile direction, regions of the hard phase are found directly next to the fracture
initiation site. This “band” of hard phase is intersected through the fracture initiation site by “bands” of the
soft phase aligned with shear. Clearly, the local mechanical incompatibility is dominant for the initiation of
fracture, regardless whether fracture initiates in the soft or in the hard phase.

1 Introduction

1.1 Objective

This paper studies the competition between the diﬀerent fracture initiation mechanisms in the microstructure
of multi-phase alloys. The focus is on a class of materials that compromises between strength and ductil-
ity by employing a microstructure that consists of two or more phases/materials with distinct mechanical
properties: a comparatively hard but brittle (reinforcement) phase and a comparatively soft ductile phase.
Examples include metal matrix composites, e.g. silicon-carbide particles embedded in an aluminum matrix,
and advanced high strength steels, such as dual-phase steel where the martensite phase reinforces the ferrite
matrix. It has been shown, experimentally and numerically, that both phases contribute to fracture, and
that their relative contribution is dependent on the microstructural morphology, the relative amount of the
phases, the contrast of mechanical properties between them, and the applied stress state.

This paper studies the competition of the diﬀerent microstructural damage mechanisms, and the conse-
quences on the macroscopically observed fracture properties (i.e. strength and ductility), for these parameters
(hard phase volume fraction, phase contrast, and stress state). This furthermore enables the characteriza-

2

tion of the characteristic phase distribution around fracture initiation sites. The results are compared to
observations from the literature, for a speciﬁc combination of parameters.

A computational multi-scale approach is proposed which predicts macroscopic fracture initiation as a
natural outcome of unit cell computations. The model is chosen quite general, relevant for a wide range of
materials in which such micro-damage mechanism are present. It is composed of a microstructure with two
phases: a (quasi-)brittle hard phase that is embedded in a ductile soft matrix. The hard phase thereby is
able to accommodate a small amount of plastic deformation before fracture; signiﬁcantly less than the soft
phase. To include suﬃcient statistical ﬂuctuations, the adopted multi-scale approach is constructed to be
computationally inexpensive by incorporating only the essential micromechanics. It uses simple indicators
for both fracture initiation mechanisms: for the hard phase the Rankine model for cleavage [1–3] and for
the soft phase the Johnson-Cook model for ductile damage [4]. The microstructure is represented using
two-dimensional periodic volume elements that consist of equi-sized square cells. These simpliﬁcations with
respect to reality enable a systematic study as: (1) the computations are fast (few ﬁnite elements are needed
for accurate discretization) and thus allow the comparison of many diﬀerent microstructures for large range
of parameter variations, (2) variations in terms of composition (i.e. volume fraction) are well controlled, and
(3) the identiﬁcation of the average distribution of phases around fracture initiation sites is well deﬁned and
transparent.

1.2 State of the art

The macroscopic stiﬀness and yielding of the considered class of multi-phase materials as a function of the
constituents is reasonably well understood and can be predicted using a variety of models, ranging from a
simple rule of mixtures to involved multi-scale computations [5–10]. Most of these models however provide
limited accuracy or insight when it comes to failure. The state of the art for metal matrix composites and
dual-phase steel can be found in several review papers [11–13].

Early papers already recognized the relationship between strength and ductility on the macro-scale and
the volume fraction and mechanical properties of the reinforcement phase on the micro-scale [14–16].
It
is well-known from many experimental and numerical studies that an increase in reinforcement volume
fraction elevates the fracture strength but at the same time lowers the ductility [17–19]. Depending on the
reinforcement volume fraction and its mechanical properties, the dominant fracture mechanism changes from
ductile to brittle. Mummery and Derby [20] have observed that fracture initiation tends towards failure of
the silicon-carbide reinforcement particles when the volume fraction or the size of the particles is increased.
Lee et al. [21] have performed diﬀerent heat treatments on dual-phase steel, and found that specimens with a
high martensite hardness (tempered at a low temperature) reveal cleavage fracture, while specimens with low
martensite hardness (tempered at higher temperatures) evidence ductile fracture; see also [22]. Using X-ray
micro-tomography, Maire et al. [23] found that fracture initiates at or near the particle–matrix interface for
a comparatively soft matrix while it initiates by cracking of the particles for a comparatively hard matrix.
In other multi-phase materials, such as dual-phase steel, these observations are not as extensive due to the
chemical and crystallographic similarities of the phases. A reduction of fracture strain is ﬁnally observed
with increasing triaxiality, whereby the decrease is stronger than in other ductile materials as brittle fracture
is often observed for higher triaxialities. To complicate matters, inspection of the fracture surfaces of these
so-called brittle fracture modes still reveals dimples [24–28]. Focusing on the role of the morphology of the
microstructure, it has been observed that fracture is promoted if the reinforcement particles are clustered
[29–31]. For dual-phase steel, voids are frequently observed near the harder martensite bands caused by the
rolling during the production of commercial grades [32–34].

To study the eﬀect of morphology numerically, the model should include (part of) the morphological
complexity of the material. Researchers frequently use a microstructure that is directly obtained by mi-
croscopy. However, to limit the high complexity and computational cost, the mechanical degradation that
results in fracture is often omitted and replaced by a highly simpliﬁed criterion whereby fracture develops
along the localization of plastic strain [5, 6, 9, 35]. To account for the eﬀect of local degradation due to void
nucleation of growth, Prahl and co-workers apply the Gurson–Tvergaard–Needleman (GTN) model for the
ductile soft phase and the cohesive zone model for the hard phase to predict macroscopic stress–strain curves
up to fracture with adequate agreement with experiments [26, 27]. However, focus is thereby not put on the

3

individual contributions of the two fracture mechanisms in relation to the microstructure. Vajragupta et al.
[36] apply similar models to a microscopic analysis. They observe that fracture initiates in a narrow hard
region and it then propagates through the surrounding soft phase. This approach is restricted through its
strong dependence on the ﬁnite element discretization.

The studies above do not systematically relate the microstructure to the (initiation of) fracture in a
statistical sense. Mostly because the studied systems are not large enough or the model too complex to
include statistical variations, but also because systematically generating diﬀerent morphologies is highly non-
trivial. To overcome this Kumar et al. [35] have tried to ﬁnd the critical morphological feature in which
the damage is high, regardless of the morphology outside this feature. To this end they considered several
artiﬁcial microstructures which carried the geometrical statistics of the real microstructure. More recently, De
Geus et al. [37] considered a large ensemble of random microstructures to calculate the average morphology
around the initiation of fracture in the soft phase. It was found that a single grain of the soft phase with
neighboring regions of the hard phase on both sides along the tensile direction and interrupted by regions of
the soft phase in the shear directions, correlates to high damage levels. These observations are supported by
experimental studies from the literature. Avramovic-Cingara et al. [38] identiﬁed that fracture initiates at
interfaces perpendicular to the tensile axis. Such an interface appears even more critical when two regions
of the reinforcement phase are closely separated [22, 33, 35, 39–41]. Most notably, Segurado and LLorca [42]
considered a three-dimensional periodic volume element containing spherical reinforcement particles. It was
found that damage was preferentially nucleated in or in-between particles that are closely separated along
the tensile axis. In a more pronounced form, it was found that a band of hard phase interrupted by the soft
phase is critical for damage [32–34].

1.3 Outline

The paper is structured as follows. The micromechanical model including the numerical implementation is
discussed in Section 2. A reference ensemble of microstructures with a certain hard phase volume fraction
and phase contrast is examined for a particular stress state in Section 3. Using that ensemble, Section 4
studies the inﬂuence of diﬀerent stress states. The hard phase volume fraction and the phase contrast are
varied in Sections 5 and 6. All variations are combined to form a coherent mechanism map in Section 7.
The spatial distribution of phases around the fracture initiation sites is quantiﬁed in Section 8, again for
the reference ensemble. In Section 9 the damage model for the hard phase is replaced by a – completely
diﬀerent – ductile criterion to assess the sensitivity of the results to the speciﬁc choice of damage model (for
the reference ensemble). The paper ends with concluding remarks in Section 10.

2 Modeling

2.1 Microstructure
The microstructure is represented using a periodic volume element that comprises 32 × 32 square cells that
represent the individual grains or particles of the material. Each individual cell is randomly assigned the
properties of either the soft phase or the hard phase by comparing a random number in the range [0, 1] to
a probability ϕhard. The resulting hard phase volume fraction is then close to ϕhard and typically varies
between ±5% of it. A reference case is chosen with ϕhard = 0.25, for which a typical volume element is shown
in Figure 1(a) using red for the hard phase and blue for the soft phase. To obtain a statistically meaningful
representation of the microstructure, an ensemble of 256 random volume elements is used. Although the
analysis is done on the ensemble as a whole, the mechanical response is computed on each of the volume
elements separately, whereby the periodicity eliminates boundary eﬀects. The resulting computation is
considerably more eﬃcient compared to a single, large, volume element. Also, the computation is naturally
parallelized.

The response is calculated using the ﬁnite element method. Given the assumed idealization, only cell
averaged quantities are considered. The ﬁnite element discretization is chosen such that the averaged quan-
tities are independent of it. Each cell is discretized using 2 × 2 eight-node quadratic quadrilateral ﬁnite
elements. Numerical integration is performed using four Gauss-points per ﬁnite element. The considered
tensor components and scalar quantities are volume averaged over all 16 Gauss-points in the cell. It has been

nodes are shown using black markers.

veriﬁed that this discretization is suﬃciently accurate, whereby it was found that the local relative error is
1% with respect to a reference discretization of 10 × 10 ﬁnite elements per cell in terms of the stress and
(plastic) strain components.

2.2 Constitutive model

Both phases are assumed isotropic elasto-plastic. At the moment of the initiation of fracture, the local
deformations are high, and the response can be well in the plastic regime. A constitutive model suitable for
such conditions is the model due to Simo [43]. This model uses a linear relation between the Kirchhoﬀ stress
τ and the logarithmic elastic strain 1
2 ln(be) (where be is the elastic Finger tensor), involving the conventional
elasticity tensor with the Young’s modulus E and Poisson’s ratio ν.

The plasticity is modeled using J2-plasticity. In accordance with this model an associative ﬂow rule is

used. Linear hardening is assumed, which corresponds to the following yield function:

Φ(τ , εp) = τeq(τ ) − (τy0 + Hεp) ≤ 0

(1)

where τeq is the equivalent stress and εp is the accumulated equivalent plastic strain; the initial (Kirchhoﬀ)
yield stress τy0 and the hardening modulus H are material parameters. The ﬂow rule follows from normality.
The parameters of the soft phase are kept constant throughout this paper. They are chosen loosely

representative for a speciﬁc class of materials, namely dual-phase steel [6, 36, 44–46], as follows:

τ soft
y0
E

= 3 · 10−3

H soft

E

= 4 · 10−3

ν = 0.3

(2)

The hard phase diﬀers from the soft phase only through the plastic response. The yield stress of the hard
phase is related to that of the soft phase through the phase contrast factor χ, i.e.

y = χ(cid:0)τ soft

y0 + H softεp

(cid:1)

τ hard
y

= χ τ soft

(3)

The value of χ = 2 is used as a reference, but the inﬂuence of χ is also studied.

2.3 Applied deformation and stress state

The periodicity of the volume element is enforced by nodal tyings along the edge of the unit cell. Only
the average displacement is prescribed while all ﬂuctuations along the boundaries and throughout the vol-
ume element are permitted. As a reference load case, macroscopic pure shear deformation is prescribed in
combination with a plane strain condition for the out-of-plane direction. This corresponds to the following

5

(4)

where ¯ε is the macroscopic equivalent logarithmic strain. It is prescribed in small increments of 0.1% until
macroscopic fracture initiation is predicted (discussed in the next section).

The diﬀerent considered stress states are applied as a variation of the pure shear deformation. Since (4)
is volume preserving, the macroscopic hydrostatic stress ¯τm = 0 and therefore also the macroscopic stress
triaxiality ¯η = 0. The latter is deﬁned in terms of the macroscopic Kirchhoﬀ stress as

¯η =

¯τm
¯τeq

(5)

Diﬀerent triaxialities ¯η are applied, each constant throughout the deformation history. For eﬃciency reasons
this is done by superimposing a hydrostatic component to the local stress distribution τ obtained from the
pure shear simulation as follows:

τ (cid:63)((cid:126)x, ¯ε) = ¯η ¯τeq(¯ε) I + τ ((cid:126)x, ¯ε)

(6)

Since the microstructure is elastically homogeneous, the resulting stress tensor τ (cid:63) is in equilibrium, however,
the strain is no longer fully compatible with it, since the added hydrostatic stress would result in additional
volumetric strain – which is however elastic and hence small. It has been veriﬁed that the relative error in
¯ε is less than 1%, by comparing the approximated response to a full quasi three-dimensional computation
subjected to a constant ¯η [47]. Note that in [47], the eﬀect of the square cell shape was also found to be small
when compared to hexagonal cells.

2.4 Fracture initiation

Convincing experimental evidence revealed that in ductile materials voids and/or cavities nucleate and grow
throughout all stages of deformation, and then rapid and highly localized coalescence to global fracture
occurs ([19, 27, 29, 33, 38] and many others). This behavior is modeled using damage descriptors that
identify fracture initiation in the individual cells (representing grains or particles). These individual damage
events are assumed not to interact strongly up to global fracture, and are therefore not coupled to the
mechanical response. Global fracture is predicted when a critical number of cells have “fractured”.

The hard phase fails through cleavage fracture, for which a stress based Rankine damage descriptor is
used [1–3]. Fracture initiates when the maximum principal stress in a cell, τI, reaches a critical value, τc.
The damage indicator is deﬁned accordingly as

D =

τI
τc

(7)

so that D = 0 initially and fracture initiation is predicted for D = 1. Naturally, τc is a material parameter
(see below).

The soft phase is assumed to fail in a ductile manner, which is characterized by the Johnson-Cook model
[4]. Reformulated in an incremental form, this model compares the rate of eﬀective plastic strain in a cell,
˙εp (which is by deﬁnition non-negative), to a critical strain εc as follows

(cid:90) t

˙εp

dτ

D =

εc(η)

0

The critical strain εc depends on the stress triaxiality in that cell in the following way:

εc = A exp (−Bη) + εpc

where the parameters A, B, and the critical plastic strain εpc are material parameters.

(8)

(9)

6

The material parameters for both failure mechanisms are taken from the literature in the same range as

the parameters of the constitutive model [36]:

= 6.4 · 10−3

τc
E

A = 0.2

B = 1.7

εpc = 0.1

(10)

For the homogeneous hard phase, this implies that maximum 5% plastic strain is allowed under uniaxial
tension.
Based on both damage indicators in (7–8) an indicator for fracture initiation is also deﬁned, denoted by
D: D = 1 when fracture has initiated, which corresponds to any value D ≥ 1, whereas otherwise D = 0.
Macroscopic fracture initiation ﬁnally is assumed when fracture is predicted in 1% of the cells in the ensemble.
The large ensemble of diﬀerent microstructures ensures that the predicted fracture initiation is representative
and not due to a statistical ﬂuctuation.

3 Reference ensemble and load case

The reference ensemble – with hard phase volume fraction ϕhard = 0.25, phase contrast χ = 2, and applied
triaxiality ¯η = 0 – is considered ﬁrst. The ensemble averaged macroscopic equivalent stress (cid:104)¯τeq(cid:105) as a function
of the applied macroscopic equivalent strain ¯ε is shown using a solid black line in Figure 2. For this curve,
macroscopic fracture initiation is indicated using a marker and the hardening as predicted if loading is
continued after fracture initiation is shown using a dashed black line. The constitutive response of the hard
phase (red) and the soft phase (blue) are also included using dashed lines. As observed, macroscopic fracture
initiation is predicted at a strain of (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) = ¯ε = 0.111. Compared to soft phase, the stress is increased by 16%
due to the introduction of the hard phase at the onset of macroscopic fracture. This increase comes at the
expense of a decrease in fracture strain of 63% compared to the homogeneous soft phase.

Figure 2. The macroscopic equivalent stress of the ensemble (cid:104)¯τeq(cid:105) – normalized by the initial yield stress of the
ensemble τ soft
y0 – as a function of the macroscopic, applied, equivalent strain ¯ε for the reference conﬁguration: ϕhard =
0.25, χ = 2, ¯η = 0 (black). The fracture initiation strain (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) is indicated using a marker, the continued hardening
response is shown with a dashed line. The constitutive response of the hard phase (red) and the soft phase (blue) are
also included.

The microscopic response is visualized for a single representative volume element in Figure 3 at the
moment of macroscopic fracture initiation, for which the applied strain ¯ε = (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) = 0.11. The deformed
geometry clearly shows the eﬀect of the periodic boundary conditions, where the average deformation is
1Although the strain is not averaged over the ensemble, as it is imposed on the individual volume elements, the notation (cid:104)...(cid:105)

is used also for the strain to emphasize that the fracture initiation criterion is deﬁned on the ensemble as a whole.

prescribed by (4) with extension in horizontal direction and compression in vertical direction. The individual
cells are signiﬁcantly deformed in all directions. The plastic strain (in Figure 3(a)) is largest in the soft
phase, in particular where soft cells are interconnected under ±45 degree angles and surrounded by cells
of the hard phase. This explains the decrease of macroscopic ductility observed above: the soft phase has
to accommodate more (plastic) deformation due to phase contrast with the hard phase. The hydrostatic
stress, in Figure 3(b), has extremes in both phases, but is the largest in the hard phase. In the soft phase
the highest tensile values are found where a soft cell is ﬂanked by hard cells in the horizontal direction (e.g.
on the bottom right). In the hard phase this is observed where several hard cells are linked in horizontal
direction (e.g. on the top right). All predicted fracture initiation sites, in Figure 3(c), are in the soft phase.
In each case the soft cell is ﬂanked by a hard cell on one or both sides.

4 Inﬂuence of stress triaxiality

4.1 Results
The applied macroscopic stress triaxiality ¯η is varied in the range [−0.4, 1.5]. The resulting fracture strain
(cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) as a function of the applied triaxiality ¯η is shown in black in Figure 4, for the reference ensemble used in
the previous section. Also shown are solid curves that correspond to the cases where failure is modeled only
in the soft phase (i.e. fracture initiation is predicted in 1% of the soft cells, in blue) or only in the hard phase
(in red), and dashed curves that correspond to the uniform soft phase (in blue) and hard phase (in red).
Figure 4 shows that the fracture initiation strain (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) is signiﬁcantly reduced compared to a specimen of
uniform soft phase. The overall trend is similar: the fracture initiation strain (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) decreases for increasing
triaxiality ¯η, as is frequently observed for ductile materials. However for the composite a rather rapid decrease
of fracture strain is observed at a macroscopic triaxiality of 0.2 < ¯η < 0.5. At low triaxialities, ¯η < 0.2 and
thus also the reference case of Section 3, the macroscopic fracture initiation strain of the ensemble coincides
with that of the soft phase (in blue), while at high triaxialities, ¯η > 0.5, it coincides with that of hard phase
failure (in red).

The two failure mechanisms are thus in competition whereby the macroscopic triaxiality ¯η plays a key role.
At triaxialities ¯η < 0.2 a suﬃcient number of soft cells fail to call macroscopic fracture before a signiﬁcant
amount of damage is generated in the hard cells. For triaxialities ¯η > 0.5 the hard cells reach their failure
criterion substantially earlier. In the range 0.2 < ¯η < 0.5 the competition is more even and both contribute.
Thus, even though fracture initiation occurs sooner at higher triaxialities for both damage mechanisms, the
brittle failure mechanism becomes more pronounced due to its stress dependence that scales with the elastic

(c)(a)(b)8

modulus. The ductile failure mechanism on the other hand scales with the triaxiality through the plasticity
via the much lower hardening modulus.

Figure 4. Macroscopic fracture initiation strain (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) as a function of the applied triaxiality ¯η for the reference
conﬁguration: ϕhard = 0.25 and χ = 2 (black). The fracture strains predicted by the isolated failure mechanisms are
also shown: hard phase (red) and blue phase (soft) and for the uniform phases (dashed).

The trend in Figure 4 can be further analyzed by inspecting the microscopic response. The fracture
initiation indicator D is shown in Figure 5, again for the volume element of Figure 1. From left to right
the triaxiality increases whereby the simulation is terminated at the relevant macroscopic fracture initiation
strain (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105). For ¯η = 0 (Figure 5(a)) all fracture initiation sites are in the soft phase, always directly adjacent
to hard phase. In the transition regime, for ¯η = 0.5 in Figure 5(b), several fracture initiation sites occur in
hard cells. In the brittle fracture regime, for ¯η = 1 in Figure 5(c), all fracture initiation sites are in the hard
phase. Like for the soft phase, each of these sites have hard phase to the left and/or right. The morphological
characteristics of the phase distribution around the fracture initiation sites are discussed in more detail in
Section 8.

response is shown for diﬀerent stages of deformation, corresponding to the respective macroscopic fracture initiation
strain (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) for each applied triaxiality ¯η (see Figure 4).

4.2 Discussion

The results indicate that the initiation of fracture is either dominated by the ductile soft phase, by the
brittle hard phase, or by both. The damage mechanisms in the two phases are thus in competition, whereby
the outcome is determined by the macroscopic stress triaxiality, which is consistent with the literature [24–
28, 48, 49]. For example, Hoefnagels et al. [48] carefully categorized and counted the damage events in a
dual-phase steel subjected to diﬀerent strain paths. In the context of the results above, their most important
observation is that more fracture occurs in the hard martensite phase for a microstructure subjected to
bi-axial loading (with a high triaxiality) compared with the uni-axial loading case (with a low triaxiality).
Using macroscopic measurements, Anderson et al. [28] observed a trend similar to Figure 5, however their
focus was not on the micromechanical cause of the strong decrease.

For the presented model, one may ask to what extent the results depend on the deﬁnition for the macro-
scopic fracture initiation, i.e. 1% of the cells in the ensemble failed. The analysis has therefore been repeated
for diﬀerent values: 1/5% and 5%. Each time, the same qualitative trend is recovered: ductile and brittle frac-
ture are in competition. Quantitatively, the diﬀerence is 0.001 in terms of fracture strain and approximately
0.18 in terms of stress triaxiality.

Furthermore, it is often hypothesized that since plasticity occurs in the hard phase, it fails through ductile
fracture instead of brittle fracture [50–54]. Therefore, the analysis is also carried out with a ductile fracture
initiation criterion in the hard phase, see Section 9.

Inﬂuence of volume fraction

In this section the eﬀect of the variation of the hard phase volume fraction is considered. Ensembles with
diﬀerent hard phase volume fractions, ϕhard, are used, yet each with the same reference phase contrast χ = 2.
The macroscopic fracture initiation strain (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) as a function of macroscopic stress triaxiality ¯η is shown in
Figure 6 for seven diﬀerent values of ϕhard, each indicated using a diﬀerent color. The reference ensemble of
Figure 4 is shown in black. Increasing the amount of hard phase promotes both the soft phase and the hard
phase failure mechanisms. This is observed as a decrease of (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) in both regimes. The triaxiality ¯η at which
the transition between the two regimes takes place decreases with increasing hard phase volume fraction.

Figure 6. Macroscopic fracture initiation strain (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) as a function of the applied triaxiality ¯η, for diﬀerent hard
phase volume fraction, ϕhard, at constant phase contrast (χ = 2). The colors indicate the diﬀerent ϕhard, the reference
ensemble (ϕhard = 0.25 and χ = 2) is shown in black.

The predicted macroscopic stress–strain response in pure shear (¯η = 0) is shown in Figure 7 for diﬀerent
hard phase volume fraction ϕhard, where the fracture initiation is indicated with a marker. The increase of
the hard phase volume fraction results in an increase of the macroscopic yield strength while the macroscopic

0.1750.250.32510

hardening is more or less constant. The macroscopic fracture initiation strain (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) decreases with increasing
hard phase volume fraction (as already observed in Figure 6) while at the same time the fracture initiation
stress (cid:104)¯τ f

eq(cid:105) increases.

Figure 7. Ensemble averaged macroscopic equivalent stress (cid:104)¯τeq(cid:105) as a function the macroscopic, applied, strain ¯ε for
diﬀerent hard phase volume fractions ϕhard at constant phase contrast χ = 2; all a constant applied triaxiality ¯η = 0.
The curves are terminated at the predicted macroscopic fracture initiation strain (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) (indicated using a marker).

The consequence of the above observations is examined next in the context of the classical trade-oﬀ
between strength and ductility, and how this is inﬂuenced by the stress state. In Figure 8, the macroscopic
eq(cid:105), is plotted versus the fracture initiation strain (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) for diﬀerent macroscopic
fracture initiation stress, (cid:104)¯τ f
triaxialities ¯η. The arrow and the increasing size of the markers indicate the increase of the hard phase
volume fraction. For ¯η = 0 it is observed, as in Figure 7, that for an increasing hard phase volume fraction,
eq(cid:105), increases at the expense of decreasing ductility, (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105). However, at the highest considered
the strength, (cid:104)¯τ f
triaxiality of ¯η = 0.6 this trade-oﬀ breaks down. At this level of triaxiality, an increase of the hard phase
volume fraction causes the fracture to be dominated by the hard phase, leading to an almost constant strength
and decreasing ductility. In line with Figure 6, this is a direct consequence of the competition between failure
dominated by either the soft phase or the hard phase, whereby the latter ‘wins’ for ¯η = 0.6.

6 Inﬂuence of phase contrast

Next, the phase contrast χ is varied using diﬀerent2 ensembles with a constant hard phase volume fraction
of ϕhard = 0.25.
The macroscopic fracture initiation strain (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) as a function of macroscopic stress triaxiality ¯η is shown
in Figure 9 for seven diﬀerent values of χ. Both the soft phase and the hard phase failure mechanisms are
strongly promoted by increasing the phase contrast, however at a diﬀerent rate. Consequently, the outcome
of the competition between both failure mechanisms is diﬀerent for diﬀerent phase contrasts. At low phase
contrast (light blue), the fracture initiation strain (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) is signiﬁcantly higher than for the reference ensemble
(in black) as it is dominated by ductile fracture initiation for almost all considered triaxialities. At higher
phase contrast (in red) the fracture is entirely in the hard phase fracture regime.

The predicted macroscopic stress–strain responses in pure shear are shown in Figure 10. The observed
trend is quite diﬀerent from that in Figure 7: the yield stress is constant for all χ while the hardening increases.
This increase is much lower than the increase in phase contrast χ as the soft phase accommodates most of
the plastic deformation. Again, the predicted macroscopic fracture initiates at lower strain with increasing

volume fractions ϕhard (indicated with an arrow) at constant phase contrast χ = 2. The diﬀerent curves corresponds
to diﬀerent macroscopic stress triaxialities ¯η. The reference ensemble (ϕhard = 0.25 and χ = 2) is highlighted using a
black square.

χ. Note that the resulting fracture stress (cid:104)¯τeq(cid:105) is almost constant due to the rapid decay in fracture strain
caused by the diﬀerent outcome of the competition between failure mechanisms.

Figure 11 shows the strength versus ductility “trade-oﬀ” with contrast. For this case, a more or less
constant strength is observed accompanied by a decreasing ductility, regardless of the triaxiality. Recall from
Figure 9 that the increase in phase contrast at this volume fraction leads to hard phase dominated failure.
Furthermore, an increase in phase contrast χ mainly leads to an increase in hardening, not in the yield point
(see Figure 10). As the fracture strain (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) rapidly decreases and approaches the yield strain, the eﬀect of
the increase in hardening is negligible.

7 Mechanism map

7.1 Results

To understand the consequences of the competition between the two failure mechanisms, the outcomes of
all combinations of hard phase volume fractions, phase contrasts, and stress triaxialities are collected in a
mechanism map. This map is constructed using approximately 90000 ﬁnite element calculations. Due to the
model’s simplicity such a computation becomes feasible even on moderately sized computing cluster. Using
an in-house code each volume element takes between two and three minutes to compute.

The resulting mechanism map is presented in Figure 12. The diﬀerent curves represent the combination
of volume fractions ϕhard and phase contrast χ for which exactly 50% of the failed cells are soft and 50% are
hard, at a given value of applied triaxiality ¯η. In the region to the lower left of the curve, that is denoted by
“soft”, the majority of fractured cells are soft, whereas to the upper right (denoted by “hard”) the majority
is hard.

The result is ﬁrst discussed for a triaxiality ¯η = 0. For a low hard phase volume fraction, ϕhard < 0.15, the
initiation of fracture is dominated by the soft phase regardless of the contrast in plastic properties between the
hard and the soft phase. In this regime the eﬀect of the local incompatibility in deformability remains small
as the hard phase is suﬃciently dispersed in the microstructure. At the other extreme, where ϕhard > 0.4,
the initiation of fracture is dominated by the hard phase if the yield contrast is suﬃciently large (χ > 2.5).
In this regime, the incompatibility between the two phases has a strong inﬂuence, as the hard phase domains
are close and link up. The transition between these two regimes occurs at approximately ϕhard = 0.25. These
observations also apply for the other triaxialities although the transition shifts to favor hard phase failure at
higher triaxialities as observed before.

Figure 12. Competition between the initiation of ductile fracture in the soft phase, and brittle fracture in the hard
phase, in the form of a mechanism map. At the iso-lines (corresponding to diﬀerent levels of applied stress triaxiality
¯η) precisely 50 percent of the failed cells are soft and 50 percent are hard. The hard phase volume fraction ϕhard
increases along the vertical axis, and the phase contrast χ along the horizontal axis.

7.2 Discussion

The outcome of the simple numerical model in the form of this mechanism map is consistent with experimental
observations from the literature. For instance, Mummery and Derby [20] observe that the fracture initiation
is dominated by breaking of the brittle reinforcement particles for higher volume fractions. And for higher
phase contrasts, Lee et al. [21] observe cleavage fracture.

Inﬂuence of the local phase distribution

8.1 Analysis

To reveal the correlation between the local microstructural morphology and the individual fracture initiation
sites, the average microstructure around the fracture initiation sites is calculated. This approach was ﬁrst
introduced by De Geus et al. [37] and is summarized below.
It quantiﬁes the probability of ﬁnding the
hard phase at a certain position relative to the fracture initiation sites. A value higher than the hard phase
volume fraction, ϕhard, corresponds to a positive correlation between fracture initiation and hard phase at
that relative position. Vice versa a value lower than ϕhard corresponds to a positive correlation between
fracture initiation and the soft phase.
therefore omitted. The microstructure is described using a phase indicator I which is deﬁned as follows:

The method is discussed based on a single volume element; the ensemble average trivially follows and is

I(i, j) =

0
1

for (i, j) ∈ soft
for (i, j) ∈ hard

(11)

(cid:40)

whereby (i, j) represents the position of a particular cell. For the regular grid used here, it corresponds to
the “pixel” position, i.e. the row and column index of the grid of square cells.
The average microstructure at a certain position (∆i, ∆j) relative to a fracture initiation site is calculated
by averaging the phase indicator I weighted by the fracture initiation indicator D over all positions (i, j).
I.e.

ij D(i, j)

ID(∆i, ∆j) =

The index (i, j) loops of the cells (or pixels) in the volume element.

Finally, the ensemble average (cid:104)ID(cid:105) is calculated by averaging over all 256 volume elements in the ensemble.

8.2 Results

The result is shown in Figure 13 for two diﬀerent values of the applied triaxiality – one in the regime where
failure is governed by the soft phase (¯η = 0) and the other in the hard phase failure regime (¯η = 1). For both,
the average arrangement of phases is computed at their respective fracture initiation strain (see Figure 4).
The origin, indicated with black dashed lines, corresponds to the fracture initiation site. The colors are
chosen to maximize interpretation: red corresponds to an elevated probability of the hard phase, and blue
to that of the soft phase. For ¯η = 0, in Figure 13(a), it observed that, as expected, the fracture initiates in
the soft phase: (cid:104)ID(cid:105) ≈ 0 at the origin of the diagram. Directly to the left and right, in the tensile direction,
regions of the hard phase are found. This band of hard phase is interrupted by bands of the soft phase under
angles close to ±45 degrees. This observation coincides with the result of [37], which however was limited to
fracture initiation of the soft phase only.
When the result is compared to (cid:104)ID(cid:105) taken at ¯η = 1, in Figure 13(b), it appears that the key features
do not change, except that fracture now initiates in the hard phase (observed as (cid:104)ID > ϕhard in the center).
Fracture thus initiates in a band of the hard phase aligned with the tensile direction (in red) there where it
intersects with a band of the soft phase under an angle of close to ±45 degrees with respect to the tensile
direction (in blue); in this case the hard phase band is not interrupted. This result is remarkable as both
results in Figure 13 are dominated by totally diﬀerent failure mechanisms. The only noticeable diﬀerence is
that the probability of the regions of the soft phase is reduced (characterized by the intensity of blue in the
bands at ±45 degree angles) with respect to Figure 13(a).

8.3 Discussion

The above result suggests that a region or band of hard phase aligned with the tensile direction, intersected
by regions or bands of the soft phase in the direction of shear are critical for fracture initiation, regardless
of whether the hard band is actually interrupted or not. Such characteristics have frequently been observed

15

Figure 13. Average microstructure around the fracture initiation sites is shown for diﬀerent applied stress triaxialities:

experimentally [29–34], although experimentally the actual phase in which fracture initiates often can not
be uniquely determined. Based on Figure 13 the surroundings would look similar for both fracture initiation
mechanisms. Using a numerical model, Segurado and LLorca [42, 55] made the observation that damage
nucleation is promoted by clustering of the reinforcement phase in the tensile direction for either hard phase
damage, soft phase damage, or interface decohesion. The results in Figure 13 are in accordance with these
observations, the main diﬀerence of the current result is that average microstructure is obtained in a much
wider region around the fracture initiation sites.

De Geus et al. [37] considered ductile failure in the soft phase only and reasoned that the arrangement
of phases in Figure 13(a) is due to (i) a phase boundary perpendicular to the tensile axis giving rise to
hydrostatic stress and (ii) shear bands through the soft phase aligned with the shear axis, giving rise to high
plastic deformation. From the current result, in Figure 13(b), it is observed that a combination of these
mechanisms is also responsible for the high stress in the hard phase. In any case, critical for damage is (i)
a band of hard phase aligned with the tensile direction with which (ii) bands of the soft phase that aligned
with shear directions intersect. If such a conﬁguration could be avoided, the material’s fracture properties
would be enhanced.

9 Comparison with ductile failure of the hard phase

For the hard phase the Rankine model for cleavage has been used so far. It compares the maximum principal
stress to a critical value, see equation (7), and it is therefore strongly dependent on the actual stress state.
Since a small amount of plasticity is allowed in the hard phase and micrographs of the fracture surface often
reveal dimples, it may be appropriate to consider also the hard phase ductile. In this section, the Rankine
model is therefore replaced by the Johnson-Cook model according to (8), and both phases thus follow this
criterion albeit with diﬀerent parameter sets. The parameters of the soft phase are like before; those of the
hard phase are selected such that the fracture strain is obtained for the homogeneous hard phase in uniaxial
tension as for the Rankine-based model used so far.
The macroscopic fracture initiation strain (cid:104)¯εf(cid:105) is shown in Figure 14 as a function of the applied triaxiality
¯η for the reference parameters in black (i.e. hard phase volume fraction ϕhard = 0.25 and phase contrast
χ = 2). The curves for failure in only one of the phases are included using a red line (only hard phase failure)
and blue line (only soft phase failure). When the black curve is compared to the result in Figure 4, it appears
that the macroscopic fracture initiation strain decreases less strongly with triaxiality. The transition from
fracture initiation dominated by the soft phase to that dominated by the hard phase is still observed, however
at a diﬀerent triaxiality.

The average microstructure around the fracture initiation sites is shown in Figure 15. For ¯η = 0 the result
still coincides with Figure 13(a) as fracture initiation is dominated by the soft phase there. Also at ¯η = 1,
where the failure is dominated by the hard phase, the key features coincide with Figure 13(b). However, the
regions of the hard phase in the direction of tension (to the left and right of the fracture initiation sites) have

conﬁguration, predicted using a ductile damage indicator in both phases; cf. Figure 4.

a lower probability. Oppositely, the regions of the soft phase in the direction of shear (±45 degrees) have
a higher probability. I.e. the relative position of the soft phase around the fracture initiation site is more
important, while the relative position of the hard phase is less important compared to the case of cleavage
fracture. Also, the orientation of the regions of the soft phase deviates more from ±45 degrees with respect
to the tensile direction. This is due to the diﬀerent weighing of the plastic strain and the volumetric stress
by replacing the Rankine model with the Johnson-Cook model.

Figure 15. Average microstructure around the fracture initiation sites is shown for an applied stress triaxiality of
(a) ¯η = 0 and (b) ¯η = 1.

10 Concluding remarks

A simple multi-scale model is proposed and exploited that uses a microscopic model restricted to the most
essential micromechanics underlying the initiation of failure in ductile multi-phase materials. A large number
of microstructures are considered to capture the – statistically extreme – fracture initiation at the level of
the individual grains. Using this model, the common observations in the literature on the eﬀects of applied
stress triaxiality, hard phase volume fraction, and contrast in mechanical properties are analyzed and reﬁned.
• The large number of realizations enables the characterization of the average microstructural morphology
around the initiation of fracture. Around fracture initiation sites, a band of hard phase is identiﬁed in
the tensile direction, intersected by bands of soft phase in the directions of shear. This conﬁguration is

hard/softsofthard17

critical, regardless of whether the band of hard phase is interrupted or not; i.e. regardless if the local
fracture initiates in the soft phase or in the hard phase.

• The macroscopic fracture initiation is dominated by the soft phase at low values of applied stress
triaxiality. Above a certain critical triaxiality the balance tips to the hard phase. This critical triaxiality
is a function of the hard phase volume fraction and the contrast in mechanical properties between the
phases, as characterized by the mechanism map of Figure 12.

• The increase in hard phase volume fraction leads to an increase in strength at the expense of ductility.
Due to the diﬀerent eﬀect on the macroscopic elasto-plastic behavior, an increase in phase contrast
does not lead to a signiﬁcant increase in strength, while the ductility decreases.
