A NOTE ON RATIONAL CUSPIDAL CURVES ON

Q-HOMOLOGY PROJECTIVE PLANES

R.V. GURJAR, DONGSEON HWANG AND SAGAR KOLTE

Abstract. We generalize results by Wakabayashi and Orevkov
about rational cuspidal curves on the projective plane to that on
Q-homology projective planes. It turns out that the result is ex-
actly the same as the projective plane case under suitable assump-
tions. We also provide examples which demonstrate sharpness of
the results. The ambient surface is singular in these examples.

1. Introduction

The study of rational cuspidal plane curves has had a long and inter-
esting history. One approach is to apply the theory of open surfaces
to the complement P2 − C. In particular, Wakabayashi proved some
sharp bounds on the number of cusps of C in terms of the log Kodaira
dimension of P2 − C.

Theorem 1.1. ([15]) Let C be a rational cuspidal plane curve. Then,
we have the following:

(1) If κ(P2 − C) = −∞, then C has at most one cusp.
(2) If κ(P2 − C) ≤ 1, then C has at most two cusps.

Orevkov showed that the log Kodaira dimension of P2 − C is always
non-zero.

Theorem 1.2. ([9, Theorem B(c)]) Let C be a rational cuspidal plane
curve. Then, κ(P2 − C) 6= 0.

The aim of this note is to generalize these results to the case where the
ambient surface is a Q-homology projective plane instead of the usual
projective plane. Here, a Q-homology projective plane is deﬁned as a
normal projective surface S with quotient singularities having the same
rational homology as P2. It turns out that the generalized results give
us the same conclusions as the results of Wakabayashi and Orevkov
under the assumption that the cuspidal curve C does not pass through
the singularities of S.

Theorem 1.3. Let C be a rational cuspidal curve on a Q-homology
projective plane S. Assume that C is contained in the smooth locus of
S. Then, we have the following:

(1) If κ(S − C) = −∞, then C has at most one cusp.
(2) If κ(S − C) ≤ 1, then C has at most two cusps.
(3) κ(S 0 − C) 6= 0.

The above inequalities are sharp. See Examples in Section 5. Example
5.2 also shows that we can have κ(S − C) = 0. Thus, the assumption
that C is contained in the smooth locus of S is necessary to have a
right generalization of the results on plane cuspidal curves.

The study of rational cuspidal curves on Q-homology projective planes
are motivated by a problem posed by Kollár asking the classiﬁcation
of pairs (S, C) where C is a rational cuspidal curve on a Q-homology
projective plane S([5, Problem 33]).

Note that S in Theorem 1.3 is necessarily rational.
Indeed, since S
is of Picard number one, the complement X := S − C is Q-acyclic,
i.e., a Q-homology plane. Q-homology planes have been studied ex-
tensively. In particular, R.V. Gurjar, C.R. Pradeep and A.R. Shastri
have proved that every Q-homology plane with quotient singularities
is rational ([14] and [4]). We also note that, by a result of T. Fujita,
Q-homology planes are aﬃne (cf. [12, Theorem 1.1]).

2. Notation and Preliminaries

Let S be a smooth projective surface over the ﬁeld C of complex num-
bers. A divisor on S is a Z-linear combination of irreducible curves
on S. Similarly, a Q-divisor on S is deﬁned to be a Q-linear combi-
nation of irreducible curves on S. A Q-divisor D is said to be nef if
D.C ≥ 0 for every irreducible curve C on S. A Q-divisor D is said to
be pseudo-eﬀective if D.H ≥ 0 for any nef Q-divisor H. Clearly, every
eﬀective divisor is pseudo-eﬀective. For any (possibly reducible) curve
∆ on S, by a component of ∆, we mean an irreducible component of ∆.

We recall some terminology from [1, Section 6]. For an irreducible
component Y of D, we denote Y.(D − Y ) by βD(Y ). This is called the
branching number of Y in D. The component Y is called a tip of D
if βD(Y ) = 1. A sequence C1, ..., Cr of irreducible components of D is
called a rational twig T of D if each Ci is a non-singular rational curve,
βD(C1) = 1, βD(Cj) = 2 and Cj−i · Cj = 1 for 2 ≤ j ≤ r. C1 is called

RATIONAL CUSPIDAL CURVES ON Q-HOMOLOGY PROJECTIVE PLANES 3

the tip of T . Since βD(Cr) = 2, there is a component Y of D, not in
T , such that Cr · Y = 1. If Y is a rational tip of D, then T ′ = T + Y
is a connected component of D and will be called a rational club of
D. A component Y of D such that βD(Y ) = 0 is also called a rational
club of D. When the above Y is rational and βD(Y ) = 2, T ′ is again a
rational twig of D. If βD(Y ) ≥ 3 or Y is non-rational then T is called
a maximal rational twig of D and Y is called the branching component
of T . For an eﬀective Q-divisor D, we denote by Q(D) the Q-vector
space generated by the irreducible components of D.

If T is a rational twig of D which is a contractible rational twig of D,
the element N ∈ Q(T ) such that N · C1 = −1 and N · Cj = 0 for j ≥ 2
is called the bark of T . If T ′ = C1 +...+Cr +Y is a contractible rational
club of D, the bark of T ′ is deﬁne to be the Q-divisor N ′ in Q(T ′) such
that N ′ · C1 = N ′ · Y = −1 and N ′ · Cj = 0 for 2 ≤ j ≤ r. For an
isolated rational normal curve Y with Y 2 < 0, its bark is deﬁned to
be 2(−Y 2)−1Y . If all the rational clubs and maximal twigs of D are
contractible, then the sum of their barks is denoted by Bk(D) and is
called the bark of D. For the deﬁnition of bark of a non-linear tree of
smooth rational curves, see [1].

The next results originally due to Fujita [1] are useful in this work.

Lemma 2.1. ([1, Corollary 6.14]) Let eS be a smooth projective surface
and D be an eﬀective reduced divisor on it. If D has a rational twig or
a club which is not contractible, then κ( eS, K eS + D) = κ(S) = −∞.
Lemma 2.2. ([1, Lemma 6.20], [2, Lemma 1]) Let eS be a smooth
projective surface and D be an eﬀective reduced SNC divisor on it.
Assume that κ( eS − D) ≥ 0 and N 6= Bk(D). Then, there exists a
component L of N which is a (−1)-curve, not contained in D, satisfying
one of the following conditions:

(1) D · L = 0, i.e. D ∩ L = ∅
(2) D · L = 1 and L meets a twig of D.
(3) D · L = 2 and L meets exactly two components of D, one of
which is an irreducible component of a twig of D and the other
one is a tip of a rational club of D.

Furthermore, κ(S − D − L) = κ(S − D).

Lemma 2.3. ([1, Corollary 8.8], [3, Lemma 4]) Let eS be a smooth
projective surface and D be an eﬀective reduced SNC divisor on it.
Assume that κ( eS − D) = 0. Assume also that every (−1)-curve in D

4

meets at least three other components of D. If Bk(D) = N, then any
connected component of D is one of the following.

(1) A minimal resolution of a quotient singular point.
(2) A tree of P1’s with exactly two branching components such that
the branching components are connected by a (possibly empty)
linear chain of P1’s and each branching component meets exactly
two other (-2)-curves which are tips of D.

(3) A simple loop of P1’s.
(4) A tree of P1’s with a unique branching component which meets
three linear trees deﬁning cyclic quotient singular points at one
of their end points. Furthermore, the absolute values d1, d2, d3
of the discriminants of the three trees satisfy Σ1/di = 1.

(5) A tree of ﬁve P1’s with a unique branching component which
intersects the other four curves transversally in one point each,
and such that the four curves are all (-2)-curves.

(6) A smooth elliptic curve.

We will repeatedly use the well-known properties of singular ﬁbers of
a P1-ﬁbration on a smooth surface [7, Chapter I, Lemma 4.4.1].

Lemma 2.4. Let C be a rational cuspidal curve on a smooth projective
surface S ′. If κ(S ′ − C) = −∞, then C has at most one singular point.

Proof. Let eS → S ′ be a resolution of singularities on C and let D
be the total transform of C. Since D is connected, by a result of
Miyanishi-Sugie and Russell(see [7, Theorem I.3.13]), there is an A1-
ﬁbration on eS − D. Let h : eS ′ → ˜S be a birational morphism such that
the A1-ﬁbration extends to a P1-ﬁbration on eS ′, and D′ be the proper
transform of D under h.

Assume that C has at least two cusps. Then, D′ has at least two
(−1)-curves with branching number 3. Indeed, those (−1)-curves arise
from the ﬁnal blow-ups in order to resolve the cusps of C and make
D an SNC divisor. Note that at least one of the singular ﬁber of the
P1-ﬁbration on eS ′ has a (−1)-curve with branching number 3 in the
ﬁber. This is not possible by well-known properties of singular ﬁbers
of a P1-ﬁbration on a smooth projective surface.

(cid:3)

From now on, let C be a rational cuspidal curve on a Q-homology pro-
jective plane S. Let eS → S be a resolution of singularities of both S
and C such that the total transform D of C is a simple normal crossing
divisor. Let C ′ be the proper transform of C. We always assume that

RATIONAL CUSPIDAL CURVES ON Q-HOMOLOGY PROJECTIVE PLANES 5

the map is minimal, i.e., the Picard number of eS is the least possible.
The map eS → S factors through the minimal resolution S ′ → S of
singularities of S. Let E be the reduced exceptional divisor for the res-
olution of singularities of S. Since S has only quotient singularities, E
is a simple normal crossing divisor. The smooth locus of S is denoted
by S 0.

The following lemma is useful in proving Theorem 1.3 (3).

Lemma 2.5. If κ( eS − D) = −∞, then κ( eS − D − E) = −∞.

Proof. Before we begin the proof, we describe the structure of D when
C is uni-cuspidal. There is a unique (−1)-curve in D, which we denote
by H, such that its branching number is three. The proper transform
C ′ of C is one of the branches of H. Let T2 and T3 denote the other
two branches of H. It is easy to see that one of these two (say T2) is
a linear chain of rational curves and the other branch, say T3, is a tree
of rational curves such that every branch of T3 has branching number
three([9], Proposition 3.2). We will use this description implicitly in
the arguments that follow.

By a result of Koras and Palka([13]), κ( eS − D − E) < 2. Suppose that
κ( eS − D − E) ≥ 0. By [11, Theorem 5.1], S − C has an untwisted
C∗-ﬁbration f over A1 such that the ﬁber at inﬁnity can be assumed
to be smooth and f has two singular ﬁbers. One of the singular ﬁbers
is a punctured aﬃne line C∗ with suitable multiplicity and the other
consists of two C’s meeting in a cyclic singular point. Furthermore,
both C’s have multiplicity at least two. The C∗-ﬁbration is naturally
extended to eS − D and the extended action is also denote by f . We
will derive a contradiction by showing that such a C∗-ﬁbration cannot
exist on eS − D.

We claim that f is again extended to a P1-ﬁbration on eS. If not, then
f has a base point on D. Let D′ be the total transform of D under
the resolution of base locus. It is clear that the (−1)-curve resulting
from the last blow up will be one of the horizontal components of D′
to f which has branching number at most two. This is a contradiction
to the description of the C∗-ﬁbration by Palka (Figure 3, pp.450, [11])
where each horizontal component has branching number three. Thus
f has no base points on D.

6

R.V. GURJAR, DONGSEON HWANG AND SAGAR KOLTE

The extended P1-ﬁbration on eS is also denoted by f . A ﬁber of f is
contained in D. We denote this ﬁber by R. The ﬁber R is reducible
because D does not contain an irreducible component with self inter-
section 0 and branching number two. Clearly R contains a (−1)-curve.
Furthermore, the only components of D that can possibly have self
intersection −1 are C ′ and H.

We claim that R = C ′∪H. First note that H is contained in R. Indeed,
if H is not contained in R, it forces (C ′)2 = −1 and C ′ ⊂ R. But C ′ is a
tip of D and R is a rivet of f . Thus, the unique component of D which
is adjacent to C ′ (that is H) has to be in R, a contradiction. Thus,
H ⊂ R. Now at least one of the irreducible components of D adjacent
to H must be horizontal to the ﬁbration, since otherwise we will have
a (−1)-curve with branching number three in a singular ﬁber of a P1
ﬁbration. Next, if one of the irreducible components of D adjacent to
H is a cross-section then H is reduced in R. Therefore H cannot have
branching number two in R. This shows that H meets both sections
of f in D. This forces C ′2 = −1 and R = H ∪C ′. This proves our claim.

Using the claim and the fact that T2 is a linear chain of rational curves,
we see that the branching number of one of the horizontal components
of f is two. By [11, Theorem 5.1], κ( eS − D) ≥ 0, a contradiction. (cid:3)

3. Proof of Theorem 1.3 (1),(2)

Theorem 1.3 (1) directly follows from Lemma 2.4 by taking S ′ as a
minimal resolution of S. Now we prove Theorem 1.3 (2).
3.1. The case κ( ˜S −D) = 0. If C has at least three cusps, then C ′ has
more than 2 branches in D. Furthermore, each branching component is
attached to C ′ by means of a (−1)-curve each having branching num-
ber 3 in D. By Lemma 2.3, Bk(D) 6= N. Then, there is a (−1)-curve
not contained in D satisfying one of the three conditions in Lemma
2.2. By blowing down this curve and any other (−1)-curves that arise
as a result, D maps to one of the divisors listed in Lemma 2.3.
In
our case, only the cases (2) and (4) in Lemma 2.3 is possible. The
image of C ′ under the blowing downs have branching number at least
3 as the branches of C ′ are attached to it by (−1)-curves. Hence, by
Lemma 2.3 (2) and (4), at least two of the branches of the image of
C ′ will have to be contractible linear chains of rational curves whose
tips meet the image of C ′. This is not possible as the branches of C ′
are attached to C ′ by a (−1)-curve which is not a tip of a rational twig.

RATIONAL CUSPIDAL CURVES ON Q-HOMOLOGY PROJECTIVE PLANES 7

3.2. The case κ( ˜S − D) = 1. In this case, because X is aﬃne, by [8,
Chapter 3, Theorem 1.7.1] originally due to Y. Kawamata, there is a
C∗-ﬁbration on eS − D.

Assume that C has at least three cusps. Then, D has at least three
(−1)-curves each of which is a branching component with branching
number three. Furthermore, none of them are adjacent to each other.

The C∗-ﬁbration has no base points on D. Indeed, if otherwise, there
are at most two base points thus there is at least one (−1)-curve in D
on which there is no base point. Thus, after resolution of base locus,
this (−1)-curve is in a ﬁber of a P1-ﬁbration and has branching number
3 in the ﬁber. This is not possible.

Now that the C∗-ﬁbration extends to a P1-ﬁbration on eS, we claim
that none of the (−1)-curves in D can be contained in a ﬁber: If a
(−1)-curve l from D is contained in a ﬁber F of the P1-ﬁbration f
then l cannot have branching number three in F . Thus at least one
of the curves in D adjacent to l is horizontal to f . But this makes l a
reduced (−1)-curve in F . Hence l cannot have branching number two
in F . Thus, two curves adjacent to l are horizontal to f . None of them
are (−1)-curves, hence the other (−1)-curves in D are in the ﬁbers of
f as there are only two components of D which are horizontal to f .
Let l′ be the other (−1)-curve in D which is contained in a ﬁber F ′
of f . By a similar reasoning, two of the branching components of l′
are horizontal to f . Thus, D contains a loop. This is not possible as
D is a tree of rational curves. Hence none of the (−1)-curves are in
ﬁbers of f thus all the (−1)-curves in D are horizontal to f . But there
are exactly two components of D which are horizontal to f . Hence D
cannot have more than two (−1)-curves which is a contradiction.

4. Proof of Theorem 1.3 (3)

We prove Theorem 1.3 (3). Assume that κ( eS − D − E) = 0. By Palka
(Theorem 6.1 [11]), if κ( eS − D − E) = 0, then there is a twisted C∗-
ﬁbration on eS − D − E or S − C is an exceptional Q-homology plane
as described in [10]. It is easy to check that exceptional Q-homology
planes do not occur since D is the SNC resolution of a cuspidal ra-
tional curve([10, Proposition 4.4]). Now the following lemma gives a
contradiction.

8

R.V. GURJAR, DONGSEON HWANG AND SAGAR KOLTE

Lemma 4.1. If κ( eS − D − E) = 0 or 1, then every C∗-ﬁbration on
eS − D − E is untwisted.

Proof. The C∗-ﬁbration f on eS − D − E can be extended to a C∗-
ﬁbration on eS − D. That is to say, E is contained in ﬁbers of f .
Indeed, if otherwise, an irreducible component of E is horizontal for f .
Thus, ˜S − D contains a cylinder-like open set. Hence, by ([7], Chapter
1, Theorem 3.13) that κ( eS − D) = −∞. By Lemma 2.5, this implies
κ( eS − D − E) = −∞, a contradiction.

Since κ( eS − D − E) < 2, we have κ( eS − D) < 2, thus C has at most
two cusps by Theorem 1.3 (1) and (2).

Case 1. C is uni-cuspidal.
We use the notation in Lemma 2.5 in which a description of D, when
C is uni-cuspidal, is given.

We claim that C ′ is not a (−1)-curve. Indeed, if C ′ is a (−1)-curve, then
we can blow it down and map D to a divisor with a non-contractible
twig, which would imply by Lemma 2.1 that κ( eS − D) = −∞. But,
then, Lemma 2.5 implies that κ( eS − D − E) = −∞, a contradiction.

Assume that f is a twisted C∗-ﬁbration on eS − D − E. By [6, Lemma
2.10], the base of the C∗-ﬁbration f is A1. Furthermore, all singular
ﬁbers of f are irreducible and exactly one of them is an aﬃne line (un-
der the reduced structure). By [11, Lemma 4.1], the ﬁber at inﬁnity is
of the type [2, 1, 2].

We claim that f has no base points on D. If f has a base point on D,
it has to be unique. Indeed, if f has two base points on D, then f is
an untwisted ﬁbration. Furthermore, the base point of f will have to
lie on H as H is the unique (−1)-curve in D with branching number
three. Let D′ be the total transform of D under the resolution of base
locus. As the base point is on H, D′ has a unique (−1)-curve which
is horizontal to f . But the ﬁber at inﬁnity must also contain a (−1)-
curve, a contradiction.

Since f has no base points on D, H is the unique (−1)-curve in D and
is contained in the ﬁber at inﬁnity which is of the type [2, 1, 2]. Fur-
thermore, C ′ is a (−2)-curve contained in the ﬁber at inﬁnity and the
linear chain T2 is an irreducible (−2)-curve. Let θ denote the 2-section

RATIONAL CUSPIDAL CURVES ON Q-HOMOLOGY PROJECTIVE PLANES 9

of f which is an irreducible component of D adjacent to H. As D can
be blown down to C, it is easy to deduce that θ is a (−3)-curve.

Recall that θ has branching number at most three. First, we show that
θ has at most two branches. Assume that θ has branching number
three. By M1 and M2 we denote the two branches of θ in D other
than H. Note that M1 and M2 contain no (−1)-curves.
If M1 and
M2 are in separate ﬁbers, then both ﬁbers will contain an aﬃne line
A1 for the ﬁbration on eS − D − E. This contradicts [6, Lemma 2.10].
Hence M1 and M2 lie in the same singular ﬁber of f . Let F0 be the
ﬁber of f containing both M1 and M2. Then, by [6, Proof of Lemma
1.4], F0 ∩ ( eS − D) contains an aﬃne line A1. Thus, F0 contains at least
one more irreducible component which meets both M1 and M2 as the
ﬁber is connected. Thus, F0 is reducible which again contradicts to [6,
Lemma 2.10].

Now we show that θ has only one branch, that is, H. In other words,
T3 is irreducible. Let M1 be the branch of θ other than H. Let FM1
be the ﬁber containing M1. This ﬁber meets θ in only one distinct
point, hence the component of FM1 which meets θ has multiplicity 2
and hence has branching number 2 in FM1. There is a (−1)-curve in
FM1 which meets M1. We blow this curve down and the subsequent
(−1)-curves until the image of D is minimally SNC. By Lemma 2.3,
FM1 maps to a ﬁber of the type [2, 1, 2] and θ maps to a (−3)-curve as
it is not aﬀected during the process of blowing down. If we blow down
the singular ﬁbers of the resulting P1-ﬁbration to irreducible curves,
the image of θ is a smooth 2-section with self-intersection 1. By ele-
mentary properties of ruled surfaces this is not possible. Thus, θ has
only one branch.

This shows that the number of singular ﬁbers of the P1-ﬁbration f is
exactly one. Hence we have an open subset of eS − D − E which is
a twisted C∗-bundle over C∗. Either this is a trivial C∗-bundle or a
quotient of a trivial C∗-bundle modulo a ﬁxed-point free action of a
group of order 2. Thus, κ( eS − D − E) = 0.

Hence D has a unique branching component, i.e., the image of H.
Moreover, the image of H has three branches such that Σ1/di > 1.
This is impossible by Lemma 2.3.

Case 2. C is bi-cuspidal.

We begin with a description of D when C is bi-cuspidal. The branch-
ing number of C ′ is two. It is adjacent to two (−1)-curves H1 and H2
both having branching number three. By B11 and B12 we denote the
branches of H1 other than C ′. By B22 and B21 we denote the branches
of H2 other than C ′. We can assume B11 and B22 to be linear. Both
branches of C ′ can be blown down to smooth points.

Recall that we have a twisted ﬁbration f on ˜S − D − E. We claim that
the ﬁbration f has no base point on D. Indeed, if otherwise, as we ar-
gued in Case 1, the base point of f on D have to be unique because f is
twisted. Also, the base point of f has to lie on one of the (−1)-curves
with branching number three. This forces the other (−1)-curve with
branching number three to be in a singular ﬁber and have branching
number three in the ﬁber. This is not possible.

Now that f has no base points on D, by [11, Lemma 4.1], there is a
ﬁber at inﬁnity of type [2, 1, 2]. This is impossible by the description
of D above.
(cid:3)

5. Examples

In this section we give three examples of pairs (S, C) such that κ(S −
C) < 2.

5.1. Example A. We start with the Hirzebruch surface Σ0. We ﬁx a
ﬁber C ′ of one of the P1-ﬁbrations, say f , and a cross-section H0 on
Σ0. By choosing two other ﬁbers of f we blow up suitably to produce
linear chains of the type [2, 2, 1, 3] and [4, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2]. We contract the
subchains [3, 2, 2] and [3] in these subchains. The proper transform H
of H0 is a (−1)-curve. Let S be the surface obtained by blowing down
H and the two linear chains [4, 2] and [2, 2] to a smooth point on a
normal surface S. The image of C ′ in S is a unicuspidal rational curve
C contained in S 0. Both singular points of S are not rational double
points. One can see that κ( eS − D) = −∞ and κ( eS − D − E) = −∞.

5.2. Example B. We start with the Hirzebruch Surface Σ1. Let E
be the minimal section with negative self-intersection. There exists a
smooth rational curve C which meets every ﬁber twice and is disjoint
from E. Let F1 and F2 be the ﬁbers that meet C tangentially. Let the
points of intersection of F1 and F2 with E be p1 and p2 respectively.
We perform elementary transforms by blowing up at p1 and p2 and

RATIONAL CUSPIDAL CURVES ON Q-HOMOLOGY PROJECTIVE PLANES 11

then blowing down the proper transforms of F1 and F2. In this process
C acquires two cusps and E 2 = −3. Now blow down E to a singular
point. One can see that κ( eS − D) = 0 and κ( eS − D − E) = 1.

5.3. Example C. Consider a cubic C on CP2 with a single cusp. Let
T be the tangent line to C at the cusp. Let L be the tangent to C at
a smooth point of inﬂection. Let p = T ∩ L, clearly p is not on C. We
blow up at p. We have a ﬁbration with the proper transforms of T and
L are ﬁbers. Let q be the point where the proper transform L′ of L
and E meet. Here E is the exceptional curve. We perform elementary
transforms by blowing up at the point q and blowing down the proper
transform of L. Thus, C has two cusps. One can see that κ( eS −D) = 1
and κ( eS − D − E) = 1.
