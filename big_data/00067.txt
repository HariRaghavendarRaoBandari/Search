Abstract: In the search for QFT’s that admit boundstates, we reinvestigate the two di-
mensional Gross-Neveu model, but with massive fermions. By computing the self-energy
for the auxiliary boundstate ﬁeld and the eﬀective potential, we show that unlike the
massless model, where in the large N limit there is a boundstate at threshold, for mas-
sive fermions there is a non-trivial binding energy.
In the limit of inﬁnite coupling the
boundstate becomes massless and the binding energy is twice the fermion physical mass.

Keywords: Chern-Simons theory, spectrum of bound states.

1. Introduction

Bound states are a very important ingredient of physical systems. From hadrons via atoms
and molecules and all the way to solar systems and galaxies we encounter in nature systems
where a bunch of “ elementary objects” are bound together. Whereas, for most of such
systems the binding mechanism is well understood, for hadrons the process of conﬁning
together quarks and gluons is still quite far from being fully understood. Moreover, QFT
in general has been developed to handle mainly amplitudes of scattering and much less
tools have been constructed to analyze the phenomena of bound states.

A landmark development en route to deciphering conﬁnement in four dimensional
QCD has been ’t Hooft’s solution of two dimensional QCD in the large number of colors N
limit [1]. A Bethe-Salpeter equation for the wavefunction of the quark anti-quark bound
state was solved and the corresponding spectrum was determined.
It is easy to realize
that the same “magic” cannot be achieved for QCD in higher, even not three, dimensions.
A simpler toy model in three dimensions is the Chern-Simons (CS) theory coupled to
fundamental matter. Tremendous progress has been made in recent years in understanding
various aspects of these systems. In particular we have shown [2], [3] that unlike the two
dimensional QCD case, the three dimensional Chern-Simons theory coupled to fundamental
fermions in the large N , large level K limits where λ = N
K is kept ﬁxed, does not admit
a bound state spectrum. This was done by proving that the ’t Hooft like bound state
equations do not have solutions. On the other hand in [4] it was shown that the CS theory
coupled to scalars in the fundamental representation with quartic self interaction does
admit poles in the scattering amplitude which correspond to particle anti-particle bound
states in the singlet channel. Furthermore, it was shown [5] that this theory in the so called
“Wilson-Fisher” limit is equivalent to the theory of fundamental fermions coupled to a CS

gauge theory. This equivalence holds for a range of parameters that does not include the
region where the S matrix has poles so there is no contradiction between the no bound
states of [3] and the poles of [4].1 These ﬁndings raise a natural question of whether the
theories of fundamental matter with quartic interaction both for bosons and fermions but
with no coupling to the CS gauge ﬁelds admit bound states. This question, in various
dimensions, is the subject of the current paper and a following one [7].

Unlike the method we have used in [2] and [3], in this paper we use a much simpler
method. Following the gross Neveu model [GN] [8], we formulate the quartic interactions by
invoking a singlet auxiliary ﬁeld which trivially upon integrating it out yields the ordinary
formulation. We compute (exactly in large N ) the self-energy of the auxiliary ﬁeld, but
this time with non-zero fermion mass, and check for what domain of the parameters of the
theory it admits poles. It is found that there is one bound state, for a certain region of the
renormalized coupling constant. In the limit of inﬁnite coupling the boundstate becomes
massless and the binding energy is twice the fermion physical mass. It is worth mentioning
that the binding at threshold for the massless case is the leading result in large N but at
ﬁnite N it was found out in [9] that Mσ

The GN model and its generalizations have been thoroughly investigated from various
diﬀerent points of view. For review papers and references therein see [10] in 2+1 dimensions
and [11]. The massive GN model has attracted less attention than the massless one, however
certain properties of the massive were also examined for instance in [12], where the binding
energies for all the antisymmetric tensor multiplets were computed.

The paper is organized as follows. In section §2 we describe three methods of handling
bound states in QFT, and in particular we elaborate on the auxiliary ﬁeld method. In the
next section we review the self energy of the auxiliary ﬁeld. In section §4 we calculate the
eﬀective potential, for the case of a massive fermion. We show that for a certain range of
the coupling constant the system admits one bound state. In the last section we summarize
the results of the various diﬀerent cases and present some open questions.

2. Probing bound states

Quantum ﬁeld theories are equipped with eﬃcient tools to study scattering processes, but
the toolkit for analyzing bound states is much more limited. Among the methods to address
the issue of bound states are:

1. The identiﬁcation of poles of the S matrix,
2. Solving the bound state wave-function, like ’t Hooft in two dimensions, and
3. Studying the propagator of an auxiliary ﬁeld, that upon the use of the equations of
motion equals to a bound state of two underlying ﬁelds.

Let us now elaborate on the latter. Four Fermi interactions like that of the Gross-Neveu
model is known to be renormalizable in two space-time dimensions. However in the large
Nc limit such an interaction is renormalizable also in higher dimensions [10]. For the class

1The possibility of having a massless bound state was discussed in [6]

of models with quartic interactions of ﬁelds, either fermionic or bosonic, one can examine
the question of whether the model admits a bound state by examining the propagator of
an auxilary ﬁeld. The latter is introduced in the following form

L(Φ, ∂µΦ, ˜σ) = L0(Φ, ∂µΦ) +

µ2˜σ2 − g˜σΦ†Φ

1
2

(2.1)

where Φ is a ﬁeld, either bosoic or fermionic, in the fundamental representation of SU (Nc).
The equation of motion of ˜σ reads

We take now the following limit

˜σ =

g

µ2 Φ†Φ

(2.2)

(2.3)

g2 → ∞ µ2 → ∞

g2

µ2 ≡ ˜g2 f ixed

In fact taking the limit of µ2 → ∞ is needed if one adds a kinetic term for ˜σ. Using the
equation of motion of ˜σ we obviously get a quartic interaction in the action

L(Φ, ∂µΦ) = L0(Φ, ∂µΦ) − 1
2

˜g2(Φ†Φ)2

(2.4)

Note that this emerged from a ﬁled ˜σ that is actually a proper limit of an inﬁnite mass
tachyon ﬁeld. This is important for the scalar case, to ensure positivity of the energy.

The tree level and full propagators of the auxilary ﬁeld ˜σ are

D0

˜σ(k) = i

D˜σ(k) =

i

1 − iΠ(k)

(2.5)

where Π(k) is the self energy of the auxiliary ﬁeld. From the outcome of the equation of
motion (2.2) it follows that ˜σ is the ﬁeld that describes a boundstate of Φ†Φ. Thus, a
boundstate exists if

D˜σ(k) has a pole in the domain of 4M 2
where MΦ is the physical mass of the particle created by the ﬁeld Φ. If on the other

Φ > k2 > 0.

hand

There is a pole in the domain (−k2) > 0, then the theory suﬀers from a

Landau pole.

3. The self energy of σ

We start with the Lagrangian density

L = ¯ψ(iγµ∂µ − m)ψ − 1
2

˜σ2 − g˜σ ¯ψψ

(3.1)

where ψ is 2d Dirac fermion in the fundamental representation of U (N ) and ˜σ is a scalar
which is a U (N ) singlet. The γ matrices in 2d can be expressed in terms Pauli matrices
γ0 = σ1, γ1 = iσ2. Note that this model diﬀers from the orginal GN model by the fact that

– 3 –

here the fermions are massive. Since ˜σ does not have a dynamical term its free propagator
is a constant

˜σ(k) = −i
D0

The fermion free propagator is given by

Sψ(k) =

i

(cid:54) k − m

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

Next we proceed to compute the scalar self energy. We do it in the large N limit for which

N → ∞ g2N ≡ λ f ixed

where λ is dimensionless. The full propagator of ˜σ is given by

D˜σ(k) =

−i

(3.11)

The system admits one bound state. Note that in this case the self-energy vanishes at
k2 = 0, so no subtraction needed.

Of course to get the full eﬀects, we need to compute the ˜σ potential, as was done by

Gross-Neveu [8], but with a ﬁnite mass m this time.

4. The eﬀective potential

Due to translational invariance the vacuum expectation value of the ﬁeld σ(x) has to be
xµ independent, namely a constant. We denote it by σc =< 0|σ|0 >. The generating
functional is given by

(cid:90)

Γ(σc) =

dDxV (σc)

(4.1)

where V (σc) is the eﬀective potential. Since Γ is the generating functional of the one
particle irreducible (1PI) n point function the eﬀective potential is thus

V (σc) =

1
n!

(σc)nΓn(0, 0, ..., 0)

(4.2)

where Γn(0, 0, ..., 0) is the sum of all the 1PI Green’s function with n external lines of σ at
zero momentum. At tree level it is obvious that V (σc = 1
N we
have to sum all the one loop graphs with a UV cutoﬀ Λ. Therefore the eﬀective potential
is

5. Summary

In this note we address the issue of bound states in the two dimensional Gross Neveu model
with massive fermions. In the original paper it was shown that in the large N limit for
the massless case there is no binding energy, namely, it is a binding at threshold. For the
massive case the situation is diﬀerent and there is a non trivial binding energy. When the
coupling constant is λ = π the binding energy vanishes and when the coupling goes to
inﬁnity the binding energy is maximal, namely 2MF , twice the fermion physical mass, and
the bound state is massless.

This result is part of a larger investigation of quantum ﬁeld theories in various dimen-
sions that admit non-trivial bound states [7]. Naturally one would like to investigate in a

with a scalar in the fundamental representation of the SU (N ) at large N .
