ABSTRACT
In this work, we study the advantages of using a Lucky Imaging camera for the observations of
potential planetary microlensing events. Our aim is to reduce the blending effect and enhance
exoplanet signals in binary lensing systems composed of an exoplanet and the correspond-
ing parent star. We simulate planetary microlensing light curves based on present microlens-
ing surveys and follow-up telescopes where one of them is equipped with a Lucky imaging
camera. This camera is used at the Danish 1.54-m follow-up telescope. Using a speciﬁc ob-
servational strategy, For an Earth-mass planet in the resonance regime, where the detection
probability in crowded-ﬁelds is smaller, lucky imaging observations improve the detection ef-
ﬁciency which reaches 2 per cent. Given the difﬁculty of detecting the signal of an Earth-mass
planet in crowded-ﬁeld imaging even in the resonance regime with conventional cameras, we
show that Lucky Imaging can substantially improve the detection efﬁciency.

images from the
source can not be resolved by a typical ground based telescope
(Chang & Refsdal 1979). Mao and Paczy´nski (1991) proposed us-
ing this phenomenon for detecting planets, where planet and par-
ent star compose a binary system. This method has also been
discussed earlier by Liebes in 1964. In this type of microlens-
ing events, a planet produces anomalies in the light curve through
the perturbation in the gravitational potential of the primary lens
(Gould & Loeb 1992). This perturbation can have weak and strong
features on the light curve of a microlensing event, depending
on the geometrical conﬁguration of the source star with respect
to the caustic lines in the lens plane. The observability of this
anomaly is mostly sensitive to the planet distance to the par-
ent star on the lens plane, so-called ’lensing zone’. This zone
ranges in [0.6, 1.6]θE (Gould & Loeb 1992; Bennett & Rhie 1996;
Griest & Saﬁzadeh 1998) where θE is the angular Einstein radius
and corresponds to the ring shape image when the observer, source
and lens are completely aligned. Moreover, in close/wide high-
magniﬁcation microlensing events when the source star crosses the
caustic lines close to the lens or the companion planet, the planetary
signals can be detected (Shin et al. 2012).

The detectability of an exoplanet depends on the parame-
ters of the lensing system. These parameters are (i) planet to the
host star mass ratio, (ii) the angular separation, (iii) projected tra-
jectory of the source star on the lens plane and (iv) the size of
the source star. The advantage of planet detection by microlens-
ing is that this method enables exploring planets of Earth mass or
even lower mass planets (Beaulieu et al. 2006; Muraki et al. 2011;
Dominik et al. 2008; Paczy´nski 1996). While Earth-mass planets

have also been detected by the Kepler space telescope 1 and by the
eclipsing method (e.g. Quintana et al. 2014), the advantage of us-
ing gravitational microlensing is to detect planets beyond the snow
line of their parent stars and explore planets orbiting low-mass stars
(Sumi et al. 2010; Batista et al. 2011).

One of the problems in microlensing observations is the blend-
ing effect of the source star. This effect refers to the contribution
of light from dense stellar ﬁelds within the Point Spread Func-
tion (PSF) of the source star towards the Galactic bulge. The re-
sult is imposing uncertainties on the calculation of the lens pa-
rameters. One of the approaches for decreasing the blending ef-
fect is using space-based telescopes for microlensing observations
(Bennett & Rhie 2002). The other low-costs method for improving
the angular resolution of images from ground-based telescopes is
using active adaptive optics or Lucky Imaging cameras.

The Lucky Imaging or Lucky exposure technique was ﬁrst
proposed in the 1960s to decrease the effect of atmospheric tur-
bulence on astronomical images (e.g. Hufnagel & Stanley 1964).
In this method, a series of images is taken with exposure times
shorter than the time scale of the atmospheric turbulence. Then,
the best images with ﬂatter wavefront are selected, re-centered and
combined to get a high resolution image. In order to quantify the
quality of images, we can use the Strehl ratio (Strehl 1895) which is
the ratio of observed peak intensity to the theoretical peak intensity
of a perfect image at the diffraction limit (Baldwin et. al. 2001).
The ﬁrst numerical calculation of Lucky Imaging in order to have
a Lucky short-exposure image was done by Fried (1978). The next
development was carried out by a group in Cambridge operating
a Lucky Imaging camera on the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT)
with 2.56 m aperture and obtained diffraction-limited images at

wave lengths of 810 nm (Baldwin et al. 2001; Law et al. 2006).
This group could improve the Strehl ratio in visible bands on a
large telescope by combining this method with the adaptive optics
method (Law et al. 2009). They could make images with high res-
olutions from Mars and the other planets (Dantowitz et al. 2000;
Cecil & Rashkeev 2007).

We simulate the observing strategy with the Lucky Imaging
camera used for follow-up microlensing observations at the Dan-
ish 1.54-m telescope operated by the Microlensing Network for
the Detection of Small Terrestrial Exoplanets (MINDSTEp) con-
sortium 2. This telescope follows the observing strategy using a
Lucky Imaging camera and EMCCDs (Dominik et al. 2010). We
introduce an optimum method for analyzing light curves being ob-
served both with Lucky Imaging and normal cameras. The main
goals of this strategy are (i) decreasing the blending effect and en-
hancing signals from the anomalies on the light curve by selecting
only the high-quality images and (ii) increasing the number of data
points by considering all the photons gathered by the telescope(s)
(providing high speed photometry enables us to correct instrumen-
tal effects and rebin and unrebin datasets). Finally, we investigate
the improvement on the planet detection efﬁciency considering im-
provement of the blending effect with using the Lucky Imaging
camera.

The outline of this paper is as follows: in section (2) we in-
vestigate the blending effect on the detectability of exoplanet mi-
crolensing events. In the next section, we review the Lucky Imag-
ing technique and study the best observational strategy for detect-
ing microlensing events via a Lucky Imaging camera. The effect
of using a Lucky camera on the planetary detection efﬁciency will
be discussed in section (4). Conclusions and summary are given in
section (5).

2 THE EFFECT OF BLENDING ON THE

DETECTABILITY OF EXOPLANET MICROLENSING
SIGNALS

The blending effect on the planet detection efﬁciency as a func-
tion of the source radius was quantitatively investigated by Ver-
maak (2000). Also, Gaudi & Sackett (2000a) introduced an algo-
rithm to calculate the planet detection efﬁciency for the observed
microlensing light curves which contain the blending effect. They
noticed that it is crucial the accurate determination of the blended
light fraction for the accurate determination of the efﬁciency of in-
dividual events. In this part our aim is to show qualitatively the
effect of blending on the planet signatures.

The intrinsic magniﬁcation of a source star is suppressed by
including the blending of the background stars. These stars con-
tribute inside the area of Point Spread Function (PSF) of the source
star. Then the observed magniﬁcation Aobs as the ratio of the ob-
servable ﬂux to the baseline ﬂux is related to the intrinsic magniﬁ-
cation of source star, A⋆ by:

Aobs = (1 − b) + bA⋆,
where b is the blending parameter which is the ratio of the source
ﬂux to the total baseline ﬂux, without lensing effect:

(1)

b =

F⋆

F⋆ + Fbg

,

where F⋆ is the intrinsic ﬂux of the source star and Fbg is the

baseline ﬂux due to background stars within the source PSF. For
the case of b = 1 there is no blending and b = 0 is the maximum
blending. From the microlensing observations, determining the in-
trinsic source and baseline ﬂuxes and as a result the blending pa-
rameter from light curves is difﬁcult and there is uncertainty in this
parameter. Hence, the blending effect can not always be removed
from light curves. On the other hand the blending of source star
by increase the level of background makes it hard to conﬁrm the
planetary signals.

In order to quantify the effect of blending on an exoplanet
signal in the light curve, let us assume the effect of companion
planet in the binary lens is a perturbation on the Paczy´nski’s single
lens light curve. Then, a perturbation δA⋆ is related to the observed
magniﬁcation δAobs, as follows

(δA/A)obs = (δA/A)⋆

,

(3)

A⋆

A⋆ + b−1 − 1

where we can call δA/A as the relative contrast and for two ex-
treme limits of b → 0, we get no signal from the exoplanet and for
the case that b = 1, we get the maximum signal.
We can deﬁne the relative observed signal to the intrinsic sig-

nal of source star by

Y =

(δA/A)obs
(δA/A)⋆

,

(4)

here the denominator of this expression (i.e. (δA/A)⋆) depends on
the parameters of the binary lens as the distance of the planet from
the parent star, the mass ratio and relative position of the lenses and
the source star as well as the angular size of the source star. On the
other hand, the numerator (i.e. (δA/A)obs) depends on the signal
to noise ratio of the observed data in the light curve.

Figure (1) represents the Y parameter as a function of the in-
trinsic magniﬁcation of the source star and the blending parameter.
In order to get a strong signal from the planet either the magni-
ﬁcation of the source star should be high enough or the blending
parameter needs to be larger. The amount of blending depends on
the luminosity of the source star and density of the ﬁeld. The distri-
bution of the blending parameter of microlensing events for 3560
events, observed by the OGLE collaboration towards the Galactic
bulge for the period of years 2001-2009 (Wyrzykowski et al. 2014)
is given in Figure (2).

In what follows, we investigate the blending effect on the de-

(

We can rewrite this equation in terms of magnitude as
∆mobs = b∆m⋆. Having larger b (e.g. with the Lucky Imaging
method that will be discussed later), we can observe larger vari-
ations in the magnitude of the star. Let us assume the magniﬁca-
tion of simple microlensing light curve is A⋆ and any perturba-
tion around it is δA⋆. Then, the overall ﬂux taking into account the
background ﬂux would be:

Fobs = F⋆(A⋆ + δA⋆) + Fbg,

(6)

where using the deﬁnition of blending parameter which is brought
in the equation (2):
Fobs = F⋆(A⋆ + δA⋆ + b−1 − 1).
The photometric error bar, due to error in the source ﬂux as well as
other sources for the noises is given by

(7)

δFobs =

texpr texp

hν

F⋆(A⋆ + δA⋆ + b−1 − 1) + C(t)2,

(8)

where ν is the frequency of the light, texp is the exposure time and
C represents other noise terms excluding noise in the source ﬂux
(e.g. readout noise, dark noise, constant gain, extra noise from fast
readouts for the Lucky Imaging camera, etc). We note that C gen-
erally depends on time. This is because the blending effect in mi-
crolensing events is usually estimated via difference imaging and
is therefore affected by the choice of reference frame. The refer-
ence frames for different observational groups are chosen at differ-
ent times. Since the baseline ﬂux changes with time, so changes C
representing other noise terms except for the time-dependent un-
certainty in source ﬂux. However, the photometric error depends
on the number of pixels which is not considered here.

The observability of a signal means that a perturbation in the
observed ﬂux, ∆F, would be at least larger than the photometric
error bar, i.e. ∆F > δFobs. According to the amount of the per-
turbation in the observed ﬂux as ∆F = F⋆δA⋆, the observability
condition results in:

where Np = F⋆texp/(hν) represents the number of photons from
the source star for a given exposure time. Having smaller b requires
a larger number of photons. In the next section, we will discuss
the possibility of decreasing the blending effect using the Lucky
Imaging camera.

3 OBSERVATIONS OF PLANETARY MICROLENSING

EVENTS WITH A LUCKY IMAGING CAMERA

In this section we investigate the characteristics of the Lucky Imag-
ing method and introduce a strategy for the observation of planetary
microlensing events with the Lucky Imaging camera. We assume
that the Lucky Imaging observation is carried out by the Danish
telescope which is one of the follow-up telescopes.

3.1 The Lucky Imaging method

One of the challenging problems of photometry and imaging in as-
tronomy is dealing with atmospheric seeing variations. The seeing
parameter increases with atmospheric turbulence where the wave
front of a distance source gets distorted by crossing different lay-
ers of the atmosphere. Usually a telescope receives distorted wave
fronts; but occasionally we can ﬁnd ﬂat wave fronts. The prob-
ability of ﬁnding such a wave front depends on the size of the
wave front patch arriving at the primary mirror of the telescope.
Hence, we expect that smaller telescopes are more likely to receive
ﬂat wave fronts compared to larger telescopes in optical wave-
lengths. The probability of a diffraction-limited image detected
by a telescope with an aperture size of D in an instant of time
while the wave front crosses the atmospheric turbulence is given
by (Fried 1978):
P ≃ 5.6 exp (−0.1557 × D2/r2
0),
where r0 is the coherent length which is deﬁned as the diame-
ter of an area over which the root mean square (rms) of phase
variation due to the atmospheric turbulence is equal to 1 radian
(Fried 1978). This parameter deﬁnes the seeing of observation
equal to ∼ 251λ/r0 where λ is the wave length in µm, r0 is in mm
and seeing is given in the unit of the arc second. At wave length of
∼ 500 nm, the most common value of r0 is about 10−15 cm, but in
good conditions the value of this parameter reaches to 30 − 40 cm.
So the least amount of D/r0 for 1-meter class telescopes in visible
band is about ∼ 3. We can interpret D/r0 as the ratio of ”seeing”
to ”diffraction limit” of a telescope:

Figure 3. Lucky Imaging of an averaged PSF by the Danish telescope. The left panel shows a diffraction-limited stellar PSF extracted from the Lucky Imaging
camera obtained from the DANDIA pipeline (Bramich 2008). The right panel represents the same image taken by the Danish Faint Object Spectrograph and
Camera (DFOSC). The image scales are 0.09 arcsec/pixel for the Lucky Imaging camera and 0.39 arcsec/pixel for DFOSC.

In Lucky Imaging, we select a fraction of images to construct
a ﬁnal image with a smaller Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM)
value or in other words larger Strehl ratio (Law et al. 2009). How-
ever, just by re-centering all taken images with the Lucky cam-
era, we can already decrease the FWHM (see Figure (4) of Law et
al.2006). A decrease in FWHM in a given seeing amount is quanti-
ﬁed by the so-called improvement factor (IF), deﬁned as:

IF =

F W HM⋆
F W HMlc

,

(12)

where FWHM⋆ is the mean of FWHM of a typical source star ob-
served by a telescope without using the Lucky Imaging camera for
a given amount of seeing and FWHMlc is the FWHM of the ﬁ-
nal image produced by a Lucky Imaging camera (Law et al. 2006).
Hence, using Lucky Imaging the stellar PSF decreases and can
even reach the diffraction limit. Figure (3) illustrates this point:
the left panel represents a diffraction-limited stellar PSF extracted
from the Lucky Imaging camera at the Danish 1.54-m telescope
(EMCCD) obtained from the DANDIA pipeline (Bramich 2008).
The right panel shows the same image taken by the Danish
Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (DFOSC). The image
scales are 0.09 arcsec/pixel for the Lucky Imaging camera and
0.39 arcsec/pixel for DFOSC. The PSF area for the image taken
by Lucky Imaging (left panel) is about 0.2 arcsec2 and that for
the image taken by DFOSC (right panel) is 1.1 arcsec2, where
we deﬁne the PSF area by Ω = π(F W HM/2)2. Consequently,
this method reduces the PSF area and blending by the background
stars. By selecting only the best images, the ﬁnal image will have a
smaller PSF area or higher IF.

In order to ﬁnd an optimum procedure of observation with the
Lucky Imaging method, we consider a highly-blended area of stars
in the Galactic bulge and determine the blending parameter as fol-
lows. First we calculate the average number of blended stars by in-
tegrating over the number density of the Galactic bulge stars along
the the line of sight and the boundary of integral within the area of

the source PSF, i.e. < Nblend >=R ρ(D, Ω⋆)D2dDΩ, where D is

the distance from the observer position, Ω⋆ is the angular position

of the source star. We take the number density of the Galactic bulge,
ρ, from the Besanc¸on model (Dwek et al. 1995; Robin et al. 2003).
For these stars, we have the absolute magnitude according to their
mass, age and metallicity. Then, the apparent magnitude of each
blended star is calculated according to the absolute magnitude,
distance modulus and extinction. The extinction map towards the
Galactic bulge as a function of distance is adapted from Gonzalez
et al. (2012).

Figure (4) shows the number of background stars which con-
tribute in the PSF of source star (red solid line) and the blending
parameter (black dotted line) versus IF. We note that increasing IF
decreases the PSF area of the source star for a given amount of see-
ing. Also we show (in the left panel) the variation of the apparent
magnitude in that stellar PSF versus IF (red solid line) and fraction
of selected frames (black dotted line). Here, we use the relation
between percentage of selected frames and IF for the ﬁxed see-
ing amount (i.e. 0.9 arcsec) given by Law et al. (2006). However,
according to the Fried(1978)’s relation the probability of getting
a diffraction-limited image by the Danish telescope at R band is
even a little higher than that by NOT at I band, if it would not be
optics-limited. Decreasing the PSF area with the Lucky Imaging
method deblends the apparent magnitude of the stellar PSF due to
decreasing the number of blended stars. In these ﬁgures, we set the
apparent magnitude of the source star to m⋆ = 20.0 mag, the ini-
tial amount of the blending is b = 0.13 and seeing = 0.9 arcsec.
Noting that in reality seeing is changing with time during the ob-
servation. Hence, we choose the different fractions of images in
different seeing amounts to have constant PSF area throughout the
observation.

Lucky imaging observations reduce the blending and the PSF
size by selecting high quality images and the aim to (i) better con-
strain the blending parameter, (ii) make a more reliable ﬁt of the
parameters of the microlensing light curves and (iii) detect small
perturbations in the light curve, such as planetary signals (see equa-
tion 3).

3.2 An observational strategy for using a LI camera

In what follows, we introduce a strategy for analyzing microlens-
ing light curves hypothetically being observed both by the Lucky
Imaging and normal cameras. Our aim is to optimize the quality of
the light curves, by means of having less blending of the source star,
enough cadence in the light curve and the least photometric uncer-
tainties for data points. In the simulation we keep the two crucial
parameters constant throughout the light; (i) we select the frames
from the Lucky imaging camera in such a way that the source PSF
area is a constant parameter and (ii) for each data point, we stack
enough images from the lucky camera to have constant photometric
accuracy throughout the light curve.

We note that in reality during the observation, the ”seeing”
parameter changes with time and in order to have a constant PSF
area of the source star, we should have a time dependent procedure
for choosing percentage of the selected frames from each spool of
images. An example that demonstrate the variation of seeing versus
time is shown in Figure (5). Here, the seeing parameter (red solid
line) is shown with the cadence of 20 minutes. In our simulation,

the seeing amounts are chosen from a synthetic series of seeing data
points which were archived by the La Silla observatory 3

Keeping a constant value for the PSF area of the source star
(e.g. Ω = 0.27 arcsec2), we calculate the percentage of the se-
lected frames corresponding to each value of seeing. Following this
strategy, during the microlensing event, blending parameter which
is speciﬁed by the PSF area of source star is set to be a constant
value. On the other hand, adapting the second condition, we use an
enough number of images to get a threshold value for the photo-
metric precision. This factor can be tuned by the effective exposure
time for each data point (texp) to have uniform error bars through-
out the light curve, as suggested in Dominik et al.(2010). Since the
magniﬁcation factor for each data point is different, the signal to
noise ratio is different at each moment. According to the deﬁnition,
the photometric accuracy is given by:
σF
F
where Np is the total number of photons collected in PSF of the

source star and σNp =pNp is the photon-count noise. To get uni-

form error bars for data points the signal to noise ratio for each data
point should reach to a threshold amount where signal is deﬁned as
the total number of photons:

number of blended stars, µsky is sky brightness in mag/arcsec2
unit and mzp is the zero point magnitude which is equivalent to a
photon collected over the unit of the area of the telescope per unit

Figure 6. A simulated planetary microlensing light curve. Its theoretical
light curve is shown with green dashed line. The simulated data points over
this light curve hypothetically taken by the Danish telescope and other (sur-
vey and follow-up) telescopes are represented by black stars and red circles
respectively. The parameters used to make this light curve are u0 = −0.04,
tE = 12days, t0 = 0, ρ⋆ = 0.003, q = 3e − 5, d(RE) = 0.9, θ = 25◦,
m⋆ = 20.2 mag and b = 0.13.

zero. (Bessell 1979). We keep the signal to noise ratio of 500 for
lucky imaging data points throughout the light curve. Note that the
total observing time in terms of the effective exposure time will be:
Tobs = texp/f, where f is the fraction of selected frames. We note
that Tobs is longer than texp.

In reality a Lucky Imaging camera needs extra exposure times
due to (i) the extra noise at the electron multiplication stage (the
cascade can trigger unwanted extra electrons), (ii) extra noise by
distributing the ﬂux over many more pixels in case of not so op-
timal seeing or the worst seeing bins and (iii) extra noise due to
the shift-and-add. The latter aspects are somewhat related, since
the signal to noise ratio generally depends on the number of pixels
used. The more we shift images, the more the different uncertain-
ties in pixel-to-pixel sensitivity i.e. in the ﬂatﬁeld, sky, etc. All these
aspects need more exposure times. The signal to noise ratio for the
Lucky imaging camera is lower by a factor of √2 as compared to
regular CCDs (Skottfelt et al. 2015). This penalty can be avoided if
the EMCCD is operated in photon counting mode.

Here, we simulate the planetary microlensing light curve
shown in Figure (6), being observed by a group of telescopes
where one of them is the Danish 1.54-m telescope. The pa-
rameters used to generate this light curve are u0 = −0.04,
tE = 12 days, t0 = 0, ρ⋆ = 0.003, q = 3 × 10−5, d(RE) = 0.9,
θ = 25◦, m⋆ = 20.2 mag and b = 0.13 where θ is the angle be-
tween the projected source trajectory and the binary axis and ρ⋆ is
the projected source radius normalized to the Einstein radius.

To produce synthetic data points over this light curve, we as-
sume this light curve is being observed by survey and follow-up
telescopes while follow-up observations are started after the mag-
niﬁcation factor reaches to a given threshold (e.g.
). In order
to make a realistic light curve in the simulation, cadences between
the data points and the photometric uncertainties are taken from
the archived microlensing model light curves along with data col-
lected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE),
Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA), MiNDSTEp,
follow-up observations of microlensing events with a robotic
network of telescopes (ROBONet-II), Microlensing Follow-Up
Network (MicroFUN) and Probing Lensing Anomalies Network

(PLANET) 4. We adapt 20 archived microlensing events and ob-
tain the sampling time between consecutive data points from the
observed data over the light curves as well as the photometric ac-
curacy of data points.
We separate the simulated data points into two categories of
being Aobs 6 3/√5 where only the survey telescopes with the ca-
dence and photometry error of data associated with the surveys are
chosen and Aobs > 3/√5 after alerting the event where the speciﬁ-
cation of the surveys and follow-up telescopes are adapted. In order
to make lucky imaging observation with the Danish telescope we
label archived data points in reality taken by this telescope which
is illustrated by black stars in Figure (6). Here we use the adaptive
contouring method to calculate the magniﬁcation of the source star
in the binary lensing (Dominik 2007). The simulated data points
are shifted with respect to the mean light curve according to their
photometric uncertainties by a Gaussian function.

Figure (6) as a sample represents the data points over the sim-
ulated light curve. The data points by the Danish 1.54-m telescope
are in black stars and other surveys and follow-up telescopes are
in red points. The inset represents the caustic curves (black solid
curves) and the source trajectory with respect to the lens position
projected on the lens plane (red solid line). Also the microlensing
light curve with the planetary lens and simple Paczy´nski microlens-
ing light curve are shown by green dashed and blue dotted lines,
respectively.

In the next step, we regenerate this light curve by replacing
data from the conventional camera in the Danish telescope with
data taken by the Lucky camera. For simulating these data, the im-
portant quantity is the time interval between two consecutive data
points. Since the Danish telescope simultaneously observes several
microlensing targets during each night, so there is a time interval
i.e. cadence, between data points of each light curve. There is an
experimental relation between cadence τ and the observed magni-
ﬁcation factor (Dominik et al. 2010):

τ = 90s 3/√5

Aobs

min.

(16)

The crucial point regarding the sampling interval is that we set it to
∼ 10 minutes once at least three data points deviate from the sim-
ple microlensing light curve by more than 2σ. Once the anomaly is
covered, we return to the normal sampling rate. In addition to the
above cadence, we should consider the overhead time in between
such as slew time and operational losses (Dominik et al. 2010). The
operational loss could be due to the weather, technical and opera-
tional issues. The average values of the overhead time in between
two consecutive data points and the lost time for each data point
taken by the Danish telescope are ∼ 1.57 min and ∼ 1.45 min, re-
spectively. Considering Poisson uncertainties for these time scales,
they are added to these two time scales.

The Danish telescope monitors the Galactic bulge for ∼ 6.5
hours on average each night during the observing season. Also this
telescope observes ongoing events during the night with a proba-
bility of ∼ 83 per cent (Dominik et al. 2010) (i.e. no-observation
might be due to weather condition, technical failure and etc).
We consider all of these observational limitations in calculating
cadences. To generate observational data points, the magniﬁca-
tion factors are shifted according to a Gaussian function with
the width of uncertainty in the magniﬁcation factor δA. This un-
certainty is calculated according to the noise σF and fractional

Figure 9. Imposing the factors κ, all data points in light curves shown in Figure (8) are shifted to the least amount of blending effect corresponding to the least
amount of Ω (i.e. Ω = 0.15 arcsec2). Therefore, all of these light curves have the same (and the least) blending effects.

systematic uncertainty for the Danish telescope σs/Fobs = 0.3%
(Dominik et al. 2010). The overall amount of uncertainly is given

by δA =pσ2

s /Fbg.

We consider different amounts of PSF area for the source star
and for each case we simulate the observations with the Lucky
Imaging camera on the Danish telescope. Figure (7) shows a sam-
ple of light curves with four different Ωs which depend on the im-
ages we select from the lucky camera data. Here the simulated data
points hypothetically taken by the Lucky Imaging camera on the
Danish telescope are shown by black signs and data points taken
by other telescopes are shown with red circles. The crucial role of
the Lucky Imaging camera is to enhance small perturbations in the
light curve compare to the normal camera by decreasing the blend-
ing effect.

Let us divide data in the light curve into two sets of being
observed by the Lucky camera with the Danish telescope and ob-
served by the normal cameras with the other telescopes. Then, in
order to ﬁt the light curves with the theoretical model, we have dif-
ferent blending parameters for each data set:

(17)
(18)

Ao(tj) = boA⋆(tj ) + (1 − bo)
Alc(tj) = blcA⋆(tj) + (1 − blc),
where A⋆ is the magniﬁcation factor of the source without consid-
ering blending effect, Ao is the observed magniﬁcation factor with
normal cameras and bo is the corresponding blending parameter.
For the Lucky camera, Alc is the observed magniﬁcation and blc is
the corresponding blending parameter. Having less blending for the
Lucky camera, means blc is larger than bo. After ﬁtting theoretical
light curves in equation (17) and (18) to the two sets of data points,
we calculate the ratio of larger blending parameter to the smaller
blending parameter, using the magniﬁcation factor from each light

curve

α =

Alc(tj) − 1
Ao(tj) − 1

=

blc
bo

.

(19)

Hence by imposing this factor, we can normalize the microlensing
data points by shifting low quality blending data points to the high
quality data points with the following transformation function:
A′o(t) = α(Ao(t) − 1) + 1,
where A′o is the new value of data points taken by normal cameras.
Figure (8) shows this shifting for different values of Ωs.

(20)

Shifting data points with the factor of α, imposes uncertainties
in the data points due to the uncertainty in α. Relative error in α
due to errors in the blending parameters of each set of data points
is given by:

(

∆α
α

)2 = (

∆blc
blc

)2 + (

∆bo

(21)

where ∆blc and ∆bo are the uncertainties in the blending param-
eters which can be obtained from the maximum likelihood func-
tion of the best ﬁt to the observed data. The optimum amounts of
blending parameters for the minimum value of χ2 obtains from
∂χ2/∂b = 0, results in

where Aj,i with j = lc, o is the observed value for the magniﬁca-

photometric precision.

Therefore, according to the uncertainty of b we can obtain
corresponding error of α from equation (21). Figure (10) shows the

relation between the error in α and blending in terms of the PSF
area for an ensemble of events. While decreasing Ω improves the
blending around the source star, it increases uncertainty in the α
due to lack of enough data points in the light curve. This effect
also is shown in Table (1). Finally, the error bar corresponds to the
magniﬁcation of the shifted data due to the error in α and error in
the initial magniﬁcation can be obtained from:

(23)

Accordingly, the error bars of data points set at the baseline of
the microlensing light curves (i.e. Ao ∼ 1) increase signiﬁcantly.
Hence, the efﬁciency for detecting planetary signals located around
the baseline of the high-blended microlensing light curves is not
likely improved by the Lucky Imaging camera. These planetary
signals mostly happen while crossing the planetary caustic curves
close to the companion planets.

In Figure (8), it is seen that the normalization of the normal
camera data points depends on PSF size that we adapted in the
lucky imaging observation. The smaller PSF, results in a higher
magniﬁcation factor. We may normalized all data points with mod-
erate PSF values to the smallest PSF that is generated only by the
best images from the lucky camera. This procedure results in max-

Figure 11. This ﬁgure summarizes the issues of this subsection and shows
that (i) the blending effect decreases the detectability of planetary signal
in the microlensing light curve and (ii) the Lucky Imaging camera im-
proves detectability of this signal by decreasing the blending effect. The
red solid line represents the sample planetary microlensing event, studied
in this subsection, without blending effect. The gray dashed lines show the
best-ﬁtted simple Paczy´nski microlensing light curves with different blend-
ing parameters. The blue dotted line shows that event with the blending
effect, b = 0.13. The simulated data points with the corresponding error
bars over this light curve are shown with the black stars (taken by the Dan-
ish telescope) and the red circles (taken by other telescopes hypothetically).
This light curve is also shown in Figure (6), so-called LA. The green dashed
line and its data points represents that light curve resulted from this assump-
tion that the Danish telescope uses the Lucky Imaging camera for detecting
it, so-called LB. In this light curve the blending effect improves up to the
amount of b = 0.51, the error bars of data points increase due to the shifting
process while the planetary signal becomes more detectable. The planetary
signals of these light curves are enlarged in the inset of the ﬁgure.

imizing the data points in the light curve. Let us deﬁne the best
normalization factor with the best PSF value by αmax, then the
shift factor between light curves with different PSFs (i.e. αs) can be
deﬁned as κ = αmax/α. Figure (9) shows the shifted light curves
with different Ωs and αs with respect to the light curve with the
smallest Ω (i.e. 0.15 arcsec). We note that after shifting the data
points, all light curves have normalized with the same factor.

We summarize the properties of the generated light curves cor-
responding to different amounts of the PSF area in the table (1). In

Table 2. This table shows the improvement in detectability of the planetary signal using our strategy. The ﬁrst column indicates the amount of PSF area (Ω),
corresponding to different light curves some of them are represented in different panels of Figures (7), (8) and (9). The light curve with Ω = 1.02 arcsec2 is
shown in Figure (6) in which we do not use any Lucky Imaging camera. The next columns represent the best-ﬁtted parameters from ﬁtting different planetary
microlensing events to the mentioned light curves. The theoretical parameters for making these light curves are u0 = −0.04, tE = 12days, ρ⋆ = 0.003,
θ = 25◦, t0 = 0, q = 3 × 10−5 and d(RE) = 0.9. We ﬁxed ρ⋆ and t0 to their true values in the ﬁtting process. We note that the best ﬁtted parameters as
well as the minimum amounts of χ2 from ﬁtting simple Paczy´nski microlensing models to different light curves are brought in the bottom rows corresponding
to each light curve. n represents the number of data points hypothetically taken by Lucky Imaging and cover the planetary signal, i.e. located at the time
interval of [0.9 : 1.25] days. Two next columns show the minimum value of χ2 from ﬁtting planetary (and simple Paczy´nski) microlensing events to the light
curves as well as their differences. The last column represents the normalized amounts of ∆χ2 to n. The maximum amount of ∆χ2/n occurs for the light
curve with Ω = 0.26 arcsec2 and after shifting data points i. e. LB.

Two next columns represent the averaged amounts of the effec-
tive exposure time for data hypothetically taken by Lucky Imaging
¯texp(s) and the total observational time ¯Tobs(min). N represents
the number of data points over each light curve. Noting that the
effective exposure time depends on the PSF area and decreases by
increasing it. Because we ﬁx the photometric error bars throughout
the light curves. The total observational time depends on the frac-
tion of the selected images and increases by decreasing this factor.
In this part we examine the best value for the PSF size that
we can choose from the lucky imaging observation. Our criterion
is to maximize the signal to noise ratio of the planetary signal in
the binary lensing with minimizing the χ2 value from ﬁtting to
the model. We subtract χ2 from the binary lensing and simple
pl) where large ∆χ2
Paczy´nski microlensing (i.e. ∆χ2 = χ2
indicates a better signal from the lensing. Table (2) shows the
best-ﬁtted parameters from ﬁtting different planetary microlens-
ing events as well as ∆χ2 in terms of various values of Ω which
corresponds to different light curves. This table shows that using
a Lucky Imaging camera and shifting data points (a) improves
the detectability of a planetary signal according to the criterion
of ∆χ2 and (b) approaches the best-ﬁtted parameters to their true
values. According to this table, the light curve with the PSF area
Ω = 0.26 arcsec2 with the largest number of data points has the
maximum amount of ∆χ2 and its best-ﬁtted parameters coincide
to their real values. Hence, this strategy beneﬁts from the two im-
portant factors of (i) high resolution images at the ﬁrst round of
analysis of the Lucky camera by selecting a low percentage of good

0 − χ2

images (ii) shifting all the data points of larger PSF area with the
corresponding blending factor in order to decrease the cadence of
the data points in the light curve. We note that the photometric ac-
curacy for all data points taken by the Lucky camera with different
Ωs is ﬁxed.

To clarify how much this strategy improves the quality of the
planetary signal in microlensing light curves, we compare recon-
structed light curve which has the highest amount of ∆χ2, i.e. that
light curve corresponding to Ω = 0.26 arcsec2 after shifting to the
least blending effect, with the original light curve taken from the
normal cameras (shown in Figure 6). We called the former light
curve before shifting the other data points by LB and the later
one after shifting with LA. Figure (11) shows these light curves
with simulated data points with their error bars, the theoretical light
curve with no blending effect (red solid curve) and the best-ﬁtted
simple Paczy´nski microlensing model (gray dashed curves). The
planetary signals of these light curves is zoomed in the inset of the
ﬁgure. The Lucky Imaging camera decreases the blending effect,
but increases the photometric uncertainties a bit (due to shifting
process) and improves the detectability of the planetary signal (see
Table 2). Here, the ratio of the blending parameters of these two
light curves is α1 = 3.9 which means that the blending effect in
the LB light curve decreases by a factor of 1/α1.

Figure 12. The contour lines of planet detection efﬁciency for some of blended events from OGLE 2012 microlensing events. In the left panel we use the
normal camera on the Danish telescope and in the right panel, we assume the Danish telescope is occupied with a Lucky camera and the introduced strategy
is used to make light curves. For converting ε(d, q) to ε(s, mp) we use the typical amounts for the the mass of the primary lens Ml = 0.3M⊙, the distances
of the lens and source from the observer Ds = 8.5 kpc and Dl = 6.5 kpc.

camera according to the strategy discussed in the previous section.
We adopt the formalism introduced by Gaudi & Sackett (2000a,b)
for detection efﬁciency calculation of real microlensing events with
the blending effect.

We consider some of OGLE microlensing events with non-
zero blending effects. We calculate the planet detection efﬁciency
of every event and ﬁnally overlap them. For each event, we pick up
its parameters from ﬁtting process: i.e. the Einstein crossing time
tE, the time of the closest approach t0, the lens impact parame-
ter u0, the blending parameter b and the baseline ﬂux Fbg. The
apparent source magnitude, m⋆, can be obtained according to the
blending parameter and the baseline ﬂux. To indicate the source star
radius of each microlensing event, we ﬁrst specify the type of the
source according to its apparent magnitude. Indeed, amongst the
observed microlensing targets, there is a bimodal distribution for
the source star magnitude, corresponding to bright giants on one
side and highly-magniﬁed faint main-sequence stars on the other
side (Cassan et al. 2012). The transition magnitude between these
two types of giant and main-sequence stars is 17 mag. We consider
R⋆ = 10R⊙ for the former and R⋆ = R⊙ for the latter, where R⊙
is the sun radius. For indicating the projected source radius on the
lens plane ρ⋆, we need to determine the Einstein radius and the
lens-source relative distances from observer x = Dl/Ds.

Estimations of these two parameters as well as indication of
the lens mass are done according to the probability density of these
parameters versus the Einstein crossing time which is plotted in
Figure (5) of Dominik (2006). Two last parameters are times when
the ﬁrst (tmin) and the last (tmax) data points are taken by the
Lucky Imaging camera for each light curves. Since a trigger is nec-
essary to start observations it makes sense to continue following
microlensing events further down after the peak, we adopt to start
taking data points at Aobs = 1.5 and to stop at Aobs = 1.06.

For each event, the parameters of the planetary system, q and
d, change uniformly in the logarithmic scale over the ranges of
q ∈ [10−6, 10−2] and d ∈ [0.1, 10] with steps ∆ log q = 0.0625
and ∆ log d = 0.03125, respectively. The angle between the tra-
jectory of the source with respect to the binary axis changes in the
range of θ ∈ [0, 360◦] with the steps of ∆θ = 0.36◦.

For each conﬁguration of lenses in terms of q and d, the planet

detection efﬁciency ε(q, d) is obtained for all the possible source
trajectories (0 < θ < 2π) which is given by:

1

2π Z 2π

0

ε(q, d) =

Θ(q, d)dθ.

(24)

where Θ is a step function and is calculated for each simulated
planetary microlensing event corresponding to given amounts of
(d, q, θ). We apply this function when in the related light curve four
consecutive data points are located above (or below) the Paczy´nski
light curve with more than 2σ deviation. These points should be in
the same side with respect to the Paczy´nski light curve. Otherwise,
this function is set to be zero.

Having performed the simulation, in Figure (12) we com-
pare the efﬁciency function of the planet detection using the stan-
dard camera in the Danish telescope (left panel) and the Lucky
Imaging camera (right panel). For converting ε(d, q) to ε(s, mp)
we use typical values for the the mass of the primary lens
Ml = 0.3M⊙, the distances of the source and the lens from the ob-
server Ds = 8.5 kpc and Dl = 6.5 kpc, where s is the projected
separation in the Astronomical Unit (AU) and mp is the planet
mass. Comparing these two ﬁgures shows that the Lucky Imag-
ing camera improves the planet detection efﬁciency in a crowded
Field. Noting that we consider only microlensing events with non-
zero blending effect. For example a Neptune-mass planet in the
resonance regime can be detected with 30 per cent chance with
the Lucky camera compare to the normal camera with 10 per cent
probability. Also, we obtain the detection efﬁciency of an Earth-
mass planet in the resonance regime is more than ε ∼ 2 per cent
with the Lucky camera while with the normal camera this detec-
tion efﬁciency is about 0.5% in a crowded-ﬁeld. If the abundance of
Earth-mass planets is high (which is probable according to Cassan
et al. 2012), a considerable number of Earth-mass planets in the res-
onance regime would be expected for detection with this method.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have investigated the advantage of using Lucky
Imaging for exoplanet detection via the microlensing method. The
Lucky Imaging method is a technique where cameras take series

of images faster than the time scale of atmospheric turbulence. The
selected best images where wave-fronts are not distorted are re-
centered and combined to improve the ﬁnal image.

We have simulated microlensing events observed with the
Lucky camera on Danish 1.54-m telescope accompanied by normal
CCD cameras with other telescopes and in this regard introduced
an observational strategy. We propose to ﬁx the PSF area of the
source star for a ﬁxed photometric precision for all data points in a
microlensing event. For a ﬁxed PSF area in the Lucky camera the
blending of the source star is ﬁxed. We have two sets of data points
with different blending parameters one for the normal camera and
the other one with the Lucky camera. We propose shifting the low
quality blending data points to the high quality data points by cal-
culating the ratio of their blending parameters (i.e. α) in equation
(19). Re-positioning some of data points over a microlensing light
curve imposes an uncertainty for the shifted data points in which
these uncertainties decrease by the PSF area. On the other hand we
get fewer data points throughout the light curve as we decrease the
PSF area (see Table 1).

In order to address that problem, we propose to produce data
points from the Lucky camera with the least PSF area. Since these
Lucky images are stored in our database, we repeated analyzing
Lucky camera data with larger Ωs, resulted in increasing the data
points in the light curve. From the α parameter in each data set
of the Lucky camera, we shifted the corresponding data points to
that of the highest α. Finally, we produced a light curve with the
minimum blending effect and highest number of data points. In our
analysis we have the best light curve according to the maximum
value of ∆χ2, representing the difference between χ2 from ﬁtting a
simple microlensing light curve and a planetary microlensing light
curve.

We have also studied the improvement of the planetary detec-
tion efﬁciency using the Lucky Imaging camera. In this regard, we
have microlensing events of OGLE 2012 data with nonzero blend-
ing effect, calculated their planetary detection efﬁciencies and over-
lapped their detection efﬁciencies. We obtained the detecting efﬁ-
ciency of an Earth-mass planet with the Lucky camera in the reso-
nance regime increases up to ∼ 2% while this efﬁciency with the
normal cameras is about 0.5% in a crowded ﬁeld. If the abundance
of these planets is high (which is probable according to Cassan et
al. 2012), the number of detectable Earth-mass planets whose posi-
tions are projected in the resonance regime will be four times more
with using this method.
