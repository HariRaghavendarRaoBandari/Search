Introduction

The hyperbolic distance has turned out to be a useful tool in geometric function
theory. The basic models for the hyperbolic distance are the unit ball model and
the upper half space model. Using these models in the plane case n = 2, we can
ﬁnd the hyperbolic distance in any domain with at least 2 boundary points via
the Riemann mapping theorem. In higher dimensions n ≥ 3, there are no such
results we could use to consider the hyperbolic distance in general domains.
A solution to this is to use other distance functions, which approximate the
hyperbolic distance and are easier to evaluate. We call this kind of distance
functions hyperbolic type distances.

The study of hyperbolic distances was initiated four decades ago by Gehring,
Palka, Martin and Osgood [4, 5, 14]. Thereafter many researchers have studied
hyperbolic type metrics or used them as a tool in their work, see for example
[1, 3, 13, 16].

In this article we are interested in the growth of hyperbolic type distances
in proper subdomains G (cid:40) Rn. We consider the growth along a Euclidean line
segment from z(cid:48) ∈ G to z ∈ ∂G. By a linear transformation we may assume that
z(cid:48) = 0. To ensure that the line segment [z(cid:48), z) is in G we restrict our study to
starlike domains, which means that for every y ∈ G the Euclidean line segment
[x, y] is contained in G.
Let G ⊂ Rn be a starlike domain and z ∈ ∂G. Let y ∈ [0, z) and denote
t = |y|. We study the behaviour of the function

fm(t) = m(0, y) = m(0, tz/|z|),

(1.1)

where m is a hyperbolic type distance, see Figure 1. Note that now fm is a
continuous mapping from [0,|z|) to [0,∞). To study this function we start of

Figure 1: Starlike domain G and the function fm(t) = m(0, tz/|z|) = m(0, y).

with an easier one

g(t) = dG(y) = d(y, ∂G) = d(tz/|z|, ∂G).

(1.2)

All the results of our study are true in a more general setting as long as the
line segment [0, z) is contained in the domain. However, we consider starlike
domains as then this condition is clearly fulﬁlled.

Our main result is the following Schwarz lemma type theorem. For deﬁnition

of the distances see the section named after the distance.
Theorem 1.3. Let G (cid:40) Rn be a domain with 0 ∈ G and fm(t) be the function

deﬁned in (1.1) for any z ∈ ∂G. For m ∈ {j, k,(cid:101)σ, c}

2 Preliminaries and the hyperbolic distance, ρG

In this section we introduce notation and consider examples of the hyperbolic
distance in the upper half space and a ball.
For a, b ∈ Rn we denote the closed Euclidean line segment between the points
by [a, b] = {c ∈ Rn : c = x + t(y − x), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1}. We also use notation (a, b),
[a, b) and (a, b] for open and half-closed line segments in Rn. We denote the
smallest angle between line segments [a, b] and [b, c] by (cid:93)(a, b, c).

2

We denote Euclidean balls and spheres with centre x ∈ Rn and radius r > 0,
respectively, by Bn(x, r) and Sn−1(x, r). A domain G (cid:40) Rn, 0 ∈ G, is said to
be starlike, if it is strictly starlike with respect to 0: for every z ∈ ∂G the line
segment [0, z) is contained in G. We say that distance function mG in G (cid:40)∈ Rn
is hyperbolic type, if mBn ≈ ρBn , where ρBn is the hyperbolic distance in the
unit ball deﬁned in (2.2).
b = {a ∈ Rn : an > b} is

Let b < 0. The hyperbolic distance for all u, w ∈ Hn

(u, w) = arc cosh

Note that we use shifted version of the upper half space, as the usual upper half
space Hn = {a ∈ Rn : an > 0} does not contain the origin.
Example 2.1. Let z = (0, 0, . . . , 0, b) ∈ ∂G and y ∈ [0, z) with |y| = t. We show
that in this case f(cid:48)

Examples 2.1 and 2.3 suggest that for hyperbolic type distances f(cid:48)

m(0) =
a/dG(0) could hold for a ≥ 0 or perhaps even for a = 1. It turns out that this
conjecture is not true in general. However, based on our study in this article, it
seems that the following is true
Conjecture 2.4. For a hyperbolic type distance m there exists constants a ≥ 0
and b ≥ 1 such that

3 Distance to the boundary function, dG

In this section we study the problem for the distance to the boundary function
g(t) formulated in (1.2). Let us begin our study with few simple planar examples,
which are easy to reconstruct in higher dimensions.

Example 3.1. We consider starlike domain

G = R2 \ Rx, Rx = {w = (w1, w2) ∈ R2 : w1 ≥ x1, w2 ≥ x2},

where x = (x1, x2) ∈ R2 with x1, x2 > 0. For a given z = z(α) we derive a
formula for g(t) and show that g(t) = (|z| − t) sin α and thus linear for large
values of t. We choose z = (x1, y2) for z2 ≥ x2 and note that z ∈ ∂G.

Figure 2: The domains G of Examples 3.1 (on left) and 3.2 (on right).

When t is small, then y is close to 0 and g(t) = |y − x|. To be more explicit

we can write

g(t) = dG(y) = |y − x| =(cid:112)|a − x|2 + |a − y|2,

if t ≤ |a|,

where a is the point in [0, z], with a2 = x2, see Figure 2.

If t is faraway from 0, the we have

g(t) = d(y, l) = |y − z| sin α,

if t ≥ |a|,

4

where l = {(x1, t) : t ∈ R} and α = (cid:93)(y, z, x).
Next we want to express our function g(t) in terms of t and points x and z.
We easily obtain |y − z| = |z| − t, |a − z| = |x − z| cos α, |a − x| = |x − z| sin α,
|a − y| = |z| − t − |a − z| and

|a| = |z| − |a − z| = |z| − |x − z| cos α.

Putting all together gives

(cid:26) (cid:112)t2 − 2t(|z| − |a − z|) + |z|(|z| − 2|a − z|) + |x − z|2,

g(t) =

(|z| − t) sin α,

if t ≤ |a|,
if t > |a|,

and here |a − z| = |x − z| cos α.
Example 3.2. Let us consider starlike domain G = B2\(B2(1 + i, 1)∪B2(−1 + i, 1)∪
B2(−1 − i, 1) ∪ B2(1 − i, 1)) and z = 1 ∈ ∂G, see Figure 2.

(cid:52)

For y ∈ [0, z) and t = |y| ∈ [0, 1) we have

g(t) = dG(y) = |y − (1 + i)| − 1 =

t2 − 2t + 2 − 1.

(cid:112)

Now

g(cid:48)(t) =

√

t − 1
t2 − 2t + 2

(cid:52)
implying g(cid:48)(t) → 0 as t → 1.
Example 3.3. In Example 3.2 we could place the circular arc with any decreasing
function: First deﬁne a decreasing function h : [0, 1] → [0, 1] with h(0) = 1 and
h(1) = 0. Then reﬂect the function across the real axis and then reﬂect both
function across the imaginary axis.
For p ∈ {1, 2, . . .} we can deﬁne polynomial function h(t) = (1−t)p to obtain
a domain G. Now for z = 1 ∈ ∂G we have

and since(cid:112)(1 − t)2p + (1 − t)4p−2 ≥(cid:112)(1 − t)2p = (1 − t)p we obtain

g(t) =(cid:112)(1 − t)2p + (1 − t)4p−2.
2(cid:112)(1 − t)2p + (1 − t)4p−2

−2p(1 − t)2p−1 − (4p − 2)(1 − t)4p−3

g(cid:48)(t) =

≤ −2p(1 − t)2p−1 − (4p − 2)(1 − t)4p−3
= −p(1 − t)p−1 − (2p − 1)(1 − t)3p−3 → 0

2(1 − t)p

as t → 1.

(cid:52)
Let us then consider general case G (cid:40) Rn. How quickly and how slowly g(t)
can decrease for large values of t? How quickly and how slowly g(t) can increase
for t close to 0? Before considering the bounds for g(t), we introduce angular
domain.

5

For x, y ∈ Rn and α ∈ (0, π) we deﬁne

Sα,x,y = {z ∈ Rn : (cid:93)(y, x, z) ≤ α}.

If t is close to 0, then the slowest growth for g(t) occurs in the following case:

G1 = Rn \ (Sπ/4,−x,−2x ∪ Sπ/4,3x,4x)

(3.4)

for some x ∈ Rn \ {0} and z = 3x, see Figure 3. Now for t ∈ [0,|x|], we have

g(t) = dG(0) + t = |x| + t.

(3.5)

Figure 3: The domain G1 = Rn \ (Sπ/4,−x,−2x ∪ Sπ/4,3x,4x) deﬁned in (3.4) for
the extremal case, when t is close to 0.

If t is faraway from the boundary, then the slowest growth occurs in the case

G2 = Rn \ Sπ/4,x,2x

(3.6)

for any x ∈ Rn \ {0} and z = x. Now

g(t) = dG(0) − t = |x| − t

for t ∈ [0,|z|).

As we will later see, it turns out that the domains G1 and G2 deﬁned respec-
tively in (3.4) and (3.6) can be used as extremal domains for many hyperbolic
1 = Rn\{−x, 3x}
type distances. Note that if G was not starlike, we could use G(cid:48)
and G(cid:48)

2 = Rn \ {x} instead of G1 and G2.

Next we consider how quickly g(t) can decrease. Close to the origin the

fastest decrement occurs in the domain G = Bn(0, dG(0)) and it is

g(t) = dG(0) − t

(3.7)

for t ∈ [0, dG(0)).

Faraway from the origin the decrement can made arbitrarily slow as can
be observed from Examples 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. We have arrived to the following
theorem:

6

Theorem 3.8. For any starlike domain G and point z ∈ ∂G we have

g(cid:48)(t) ≤ 1,

for t ∈ [0,|z|).

Moreover,

−1 ≤ g(cid:48)(0) ≤ 1 and − 1 ≤ lim

t→|z| g(cid:48)(t) ≤ 0.

4 Distance ratio distance, jG

In this section we estimate fj(t) for the distance ratio distance jG, which is
deﬁned in any open subset G (cid:40) Rn for points u, w ∈ G by

(cid:18)

jG(u, w) = log

1 +

|u − w|

min{dG(u), dG(w)}

(cid:19)

.

The distance ratio distance was introduced by Vuorinen in the 1980’s [17] and
in a slightly diﬀerent form by Gehring and Osgood [4].

For fj(t) we can use the same domains as for g(t) to consider the extremal

cases. Note that the following result is true also in non starlike domains.
Theorem 4.1. Let G (cid:40) Rn be a starlike domain and z ∈ ∂G. For the distance
ratio distance jG we have f(cid:48)

j(0) = 1/dG(0),

fj(t) ≥ log

(cid:18)
(cid:18) dG(0)

1 +

t

dG(0)

dG(0) − t)

and

fj(t) ≤ log

Proof. Let us ﬁrst consider lower bound for fj(0). We denote a closest boundary
x ∈ ∂G with dG(0) = |0 − x| and z ∈ ∂G. Now y ∈ [0,|z|) with |y| = t we have

(cid:19)
(cid:19)

(cid:18)
(cid:19)

for all t ∈ [0,|z|),

for all t ∈ [0, dG(0)).

(cid:18)

fj(t) = jG(0, y) = log

:= l(t).

This is obtained for example as in (3.5) in the domain G1 = Rn \ (Sπ/4,−x,−2x ∪
Sπ/4,3x,4x) for some x ∈ Rn \ {0} and z = 3x.
may assume dG(y) ≤ dG(0) and obtain by (3.7)

Let us then consider upper bound for fj(0). Now as dG(0) is a constant we

(cid:18)
(cid:18)

fj(t) = log

1 +

min{dG(0), dG(y)}

= log

(cid:19)

dG(y)

=: u(t).

This situation is obtained in the domain G(cid:48) = Bn(0, dG(0)), because for any G
we have G(cid:48) ⊂ G.

The upper and lower bounds of fj(t) give us
j(0) ≤ lim
t→0

l(cid:48)(t) = lim
t→0

≤ f(cid:48)

lim
t→0

1

dG(0) + t

u(cid:48)(t) = lim
t→0

1

dG(0) − t

which yields f(cid:48)

j(0) = 1/dG(0).

Note that the lower bound for fj(t) in Theorem 4.1 works for all t whereas
the upper bound holds only close to the origin. As a matter of fact, by Theorem
3.8, the function g(cid:48)(t) can be arbitrarily close to zero near the boundary and
therefore we cannot ﬁnd an upper bound for fj(t) in this case.

5 Quasihyperbolic distance, kG
Next we consider the quasihyperbolic distance. Let G (cid:40) Rn be a domain. We
deﬁne the quasihyperbolic length of a curve γ ⊂ G by

(cid:90)

|du|
dG(u)

.

γ

(cid:96)k(γ) =

For u, w ∈ G the quasihyperbolic distance between u and w is deﬁne by

kG(u, w) = inf
γuw

(cid:96)(γuw),

where the inﬁmum is taken over all rectiﬁable curves γuw joining u and w in
G. The quasihyperbolic distance was introduced in the 1970’s by Gehring and
Palka [4].
Theorem 5.1. Let G (cid:40) Rn be a starlike domain and z ∈ ∂G. For the quasihy-
perbolic distance kG we have f(cid:48)

k(0) = 1/dG(0),

Proof. We start by ﬁnding a lower bound for fk(t). Let z ∈ ∂G and y ∈ [0, z).
For t = |z| we estimate

f (t) = kG(0, y) =

[0,y]

dG(0) + u

dG(0) + u

= log(dG(0) + t) − log dG(0) = log

8

fk(t) ≥ log

and

fk(t) ≤ log

for all t ∈ [0, dG(0)).

For G(cid:48) = Bn(0, dG(0)) and y ∈ [0, dG(0)) clearly dG(cid:48)(0) = dG(0) and we obtain

(cid:90) t

f (t) = kG(0, tz/|z|) ≤ kG(cid:48)(0, tz/|z|) =

= − log(dG(0) − t) + log dG(0) = log

.

The lower and the upper bounds of fk(t) are equal to the corresponding bounds
for fj(t) and the expression for f(cid:48)

k(0) follows as in the proof of Theorem 4.1.

Exactly same observation for fk(t) near the boundary can be made that we
made for the distance ratio distance. Theorem 5.1 gives a lower bound and an
upper bound can not be obtained.

6 Triangular ratio distance, sG (σG)
For a domain G (cid:40) Rn and points u, w ∈ G we deﬁne the triangular ratio distance
by

sG(u, w) = sup
q∈∂G

|u − q| + |q − w| .

|u − w|

Geometrically the supremum is attained at a point q such that it is either on
line segment [u, w] or if this is not possible, then q is on the largest ellipsoid with
focii u and w contained in G. The triangular ratio distance was introduced by
H¨ast¨o in the 2000’s [7]. Since sG ∈ [0, 1] we observe that sG is not hyperbolic
type. For u, w ∈ G we deﬁne

σG(u, w) = tan

πsG(u, w)

2

to obtain a hyperbolic type distance.
As in the case of the distance to the boundary function and the distance
ratio distance we can use the same extremal domains. The domain G1 = Rn \
(Sπ/4,−x,−2x ∪ Sπ/4,3x,4x) for some x ∈ Rn \ {0} and z = 3x gives lower bound

fs(t) ≥

t

dG(0) + (dG(0) + t)

=

t

2dG(0) + t

(6.1)

for t ∈ [0,|z|).

The domain G2 = Rn \ Sπ/4,x,2x for any x ∈ Rn \ {0} and z = x gives upper

bound

for t ∈ [0, d(0)).

fs(t) ≤

t

dG(y) + (dG(y) − t)

=

t

2dG(0) − t

(6.2)

Combining these estimates we obtain:

9

Theorem 6.3. Let G (cid:40) Rn be a starlike domain and z ∈ ∂G. Then

fσ(t) ≥ tan

πt

4dG(0) + 2t

for t ∈ [0,|z|) and

fσ(t) ≤ tan

πt

4dG(0) − 2t

for t ∈ [0, d(0)). Moreover, f(cid:48)

σ(0) = π/(4dG(0)).

Proof. The bounds for fσ(t) follow from (6.1) and (6.2). By diﬀerentiation we
obtain

∂
∂t

tan

πt

4dG(0) ± 2t

=

πdG(0) + 4πdG(0) tan2

4dG(0)2 ± 4dG(0)t + t2

πt

4dG(0) ± 2t

and thus fσ(0) = π/(4dG(0)).

Remark 6.4. Theorem 6.3 suggests that an alternative way to deﬁne a hyper-

bolic type distance by using the triangular ratio distance, could be (cid:101)σG(u, w) =
π σG(u, w). For this distance function f(cid:48)(cid:101)σ(0) = 1/dG(0).

7 Cassinian distance, cG
For a domain G (cid:40) Rn and points u, w ∈ G we deﬁne the Cassinian distance by

cG(u, w) = sup
q∈∂G

|u − w|

|u − q||q − w| .

The Cassinian distance was introduced by Ibragimov in the 2000’s [8]. In the
plane case the supremum is attained at a point q that is on the largest Cassinian
oval with focii u and w contained in G.
Theorem 7.1. Let G (cid:40) Rn be a starlike domain and z ∈ ∂G. Then

for t ∈ [0,|z|) and

fc(t) ≥

fc(t) ≤

t

dG(0)(dG(0) + t)

t

dG(0)(dG(0) − t)

for t ∈ [0, d(0)). Moreover, f(cid:48)
Proof. The domain G1 = Rn \ (Sπ/4,−x,−2x ∪ Sπ/4,3x,4x) for some x ∈ Rn \ {0}
and z = 3x gives lower bound

c(0) = 1/dG(0).

fc(t) ≥

t

dG(0)(dG(0) + t)

10

for t ∈ [0,|z|).

The domain G2 = Rn \ Sπ/4,x,2x for any x ∈ Rn \ {0} and z = x gives upper

bound

fc(t) ≤

for t ∈ [0, d(0)).

Diﬀerentiation gives

t

dG(y)(dG(y) + t)

=

t

dG(0)(dG(0) − t)

∂
∂t

t

dG(0)(dG(0) ± t)

=

dG(0)

dG(0)2 ± 2dG(0)t + t2

and clearly f(cid:48)

c(0) = 1/dG(0).

8 Apollonian distance, αG
Let G ⊂ Rn be a domain such that ∂G is not contained in a sphere in Rn. Then
for u, w ∈ G we deﬁne the Apollonian distance [3, Theorem 1.1] by

αG(u, w) = sup
a,b∈∂G

log

|a − w||b − u|
|a − u||b − w| .

The Apollonian distance was introduced by Barbilian in the 1930’s [2] and rein-
troduced by Beardon in the 1990’s in connection with the hyperbolic metric [3].
It is worth pointing out that we can write
|a − w|
|a − u| + sup
b∈∂G

αG(u, w) = sup
a∈∂G

|b − u|
|b − w|

(8.1)

log

log

and in the case n = 2 each quotient deﬁnes an Apollonian circle. Taking the
supremum means that we take the largest possible Apollonian circles in G.
Lemma 8.2. Let u ∈ Rn, r > 0 and w ∈ Bn(u, r). Denote S = Sn−1(u, r).
Then

|w − a|
|u − a| =

|u − a| ≤ sup

Next we note that the function g(r) = (r + γ)/r, γ > 0, is decreasing on
(0,∞), because g(cid:48)(r) = −γ/(rγ + r2) < 0. The function h(r) = r/(r− γ), γ > 0,
is decreasing on (γ,∞), because h(cid:48)(r) = γ/(γr − r2) < 0.

Combining monotonicity of g with (8.3) gives

Theorem 8.5. Let G ⊂ Rn be a starlike domain and z ∈ ∂G. Then

for t ∈ [0,|z|) and

dG(0) − t
for t ∈ [0, dG(0)). Moreover, we have 1/dG(0) ≤ f(cid:48)
bound for fα(t) and the lower bound for f(cid:48)
Proof. By (8.1) we can estimate αG(0, y) by estimating sup log(|a − y|/|a|) and
sup log(|a|/|a − y|) separately.

α(0) ≤ 2/dG(0) and the upper

α(0) are best possible.

By Lemma 8.2 we obtain upper bounds

Together these two inequalities give us

(8.7)

Diﬀerentiation of (8.6) gives 2dG(0)/(dG(0)2−t2) and diﬀerentiation of (8.7)

gives 1/(dG(0) + t). Thus 1/dG(0) ≤ f(cid:48)
fα(t) and the lower bound for f(cid:48)

Finally, we give two example domains, which show that the upper bound for
The domain G(cid:48) = Rn \ (Sπ/4,−x,−2x ∪ Sπ/4,x,2x) for some x ∈ Rn \ {0} and
z = x shows that the upper bound is best possible. Now the suprema in the
deﬁnition of the Apollonian distance are obtained at −x and x, and thus

α(0) are best possible.

α(0) ≤ 2/dG(0).

αG(cid:48)(0, y) = log

| − x − y||x|
| − x||x − y| = log

dG(0) + t
dG(0) − t

.

The domain G2 deﬁned in (3.6) shows that the lower bound for f(cid:48)

α(0) is best

possible. We recall that

G2 = Rn \ Sπ/4,x,2x

for any x ∈ Rn \ {0} and z = x. For u ∈ ∂G2 with |u − x| = a > 0 we have

αG2(0, y) = lim

a→∞ log

|u − y||x|
|u||x − y| = log

|x|

|x − y| = log

dG(0)
dG(0) − t

and diﬀerentiation together with taking the limit gives 1/(dG(0)− t) → 1/dG(0)
as t → 0.

Note that in the Theorem 8.5 also the upper bound for f(cid:48)

α(0) is best possible,
because the upper bound for fα(t) is best possible and both upper and lower
bounds of fα(t) tend to 0 as t → 0.

for δG(x, y).

and the assertion follows.

The following lower bound for δG(x, y) is from [15, Theorem 3.11].

Proposition 9.2. Let G ⊂ Rn be a domain and ∂G is not contained in a sphere
in Rn. Then for all x, y ∈ G we have

αG(x, y) ≤ δG(x, y).

We also need exact formulas for the Seittenranta distance in two starlike

domains.
Lemma 9.3. Let G2 be the domain deﬁned in (3.6) for some x ∈ Rn \ {0} and
deﬁne a starlike domain

G3 = G2 \ {u ∈ Rn : |u + 2x| ≤ |u|}.

where i ∈ {2, 3}. The idea of our proof is to ﬁrst show that for any b ∈ ∂Gi the
supremum over a ∈ ∂Gi is attained at a = a0. Using this property we can ﬁnd
supremum over b.

14

(1) We denote ra = |x − a| and rb = |x − b|. For ra, rb > 0 the angle

(cid:93)(0, x, a) = (cid:93)(0, x, b) = 3π/4 and by the law of cosines

The denominator of f(cid:48)(t) is positive, because t > |x|, rb > 0 and t2−|x|(cid:112)2t2 − |x|2 >

Let us now consider δG2 (0, y). If |b − x| < |x|, then |a − b|/|b| ≤ |x − b|/|x|
and the suprema in the deﬁnition of the Seittenranta metric are obtained at
a = x, b = ∞ implying

If |b − x| ≥ |x|, then |a − b|/|b| ≤ 1 and the suprema in the deﬁnition of the
Seittenranta metric are obtained at a = ∞, b = x implying

(2) It is easy to see that ∂G3 consists of ∂G2 and a line L. If both a, b ∈ ∂G2,
then the assertion follows from (1). We assume b ∈ L and denote |b + x| = s.

15

For any a ∈ ∂G3 with |a| = t we may assume that |a − b| is maximal. This
√
2 = r. Now for r, s ≥ 0
immediately implies that a ∈ ∂G2. We denote |x − a|/
we have by the Pythagorean theorem

|a − b|2 = (s + r)2 + (2|x| + r)2,

|a|2 = r2 + (|x| + r)2,

and we want to ﬁnd maximum of

f (r) =

|a − b|2
|a|2 =

(s + r)2 + (2|x| + r)2

r2 + (|x| + r)2

,

r ≥ 0.

We show that f (r) is a decreasing function. Diﬀerentiation gives

f(cid:48)(r) =

−2(|x|(2r2 + s2) + |x|2(6r − s) + 2rs(r + s) + 2|x|3)

(r2 + (|x| + r)2)2

and the numerator of f(cid:48)(r) equals zero whenever r = h(s) for

h(s) = −s2 − 3|x|2 ±(cid:112)s4 − 2s3|x| + 6s2|x|2 − 2s|x|3 + 5|x|4.
If we choose minus in ± then clearly h(s) < 0. If we choose plus in ±, then the
equation h(s) = 0 has solution s = −|x| and s = (|x| ± √
7|x|i)/2. Now h(s) is
h(1) = −1 − 3|x|2 +(cid:112)1 − 2|x| + 6|x|2 − 2|x|3 + 5|x|4
either positive or negative for s ≥ 0. We estimate
= −1 − 3|x|2 +(cid:112)(1 + |x|2)(1 − 2|x| + 5|x|2)
≤ −1 − 3|x|2 +(cid:112)(1 + |x|2)(1 + 5|x|2)
≤ −1 − 3|x|2 +(cid:112)1 + 6|x|2 + 5|x|4 < 0.

We have obtained h(s) < 0 and since

f(cid:48)(s/6) =

−2(|x|(2(s/6)2 + s2) + 2(s/6)s((s/6) + s) + 2|x|3)

((s/6)2 + (|x| + (s/6))2)2

< 0

we have f(cid:48)(r) < 0 for all r ≥ 0.
Now we are ready to consider δG3(0, y). For any ﬁxed b ∈ ∂G3, the largest
value for |a − b|/|a| is obtained for a = x. Thus the suprema in the deﬁnition
of the Seittenranta metric are obtained at a = x, b = −x implying

Finally, we show that the bounds for f(cid:48)

10 Visual angle distance, vG (τG)
Let G (cid:40) Rn be a domain. For u, w ∈ G we deﬁne the visual angle distance by

vG(u, w) = sup
a∈∂G

(cid:93)(u, a, w).

17

The visual angle distance was introduced in the 2010’s in [12]. Clearly v(u, w) ∈
[0, π] and therefore we deﬁne for u, w ∈ G a hyperbolic type distance

τG(u, w) = tan

vG(u, w)

.

2

Proposition 10.1. Let l ⊂ Rn \ {0} be a line and u, w ∈ l. Then the function

h(β) = vRn\{0}(u, u + β(w − u))

is strictly increasing for β ≥ 0.
Proof. Now vRn\{0}(u, a) = (cid:93)(u, 0, a) and the point a = a(β) = u + β(w − u)
moves along the line l. It is easy to see that a(0) = u, a(1) = w and |u − a| is
strictly increasing as a function of β.

By the law of sines

|u − a|

sin (cid:93)(u, 0, a)

=

|u|

sin (cid:93)(0, a, u)

and since (cid:93)(a, u, 0) is constant we obtain for c = π − (cid:93)(a, u, 0) ∈ (0, π)
|u − a| = |u| sin (cid:93)(u, 0, a)
vRn\{0}(u, a)
sin(c − vRn\{0}(u, a))
.
sin (cid:93)(0, a, u)
Now |u| is a constant and |u − a| is strictly increasing. Thus we need to show
that for c ∈ (0, π) the function

sin(c − (cid:93)(u, 0, a))

sin (cid:93)(u, 0, a)

= |u|

= |u|

h(γ) =

γ
c − γ

is strictly increasing in (0, c). By diﬀerentiation we obtain

h(cid:48)(γ) =

sin c

(sin(c − γ))2 > 0

and the assertion follows.

In Proposition 10.1 the line l did not contain 0. If l ⊂ Rn with 0 ∈ l, then

for any u, w ∈ l \ {0} we have

(cid:26) 0,

if 0 (cid:54)∈ [u, w],
if 0 ∈ [u, w].
Theorem 10.3. Let G (cid:40) Rn be a starlike domain. Then

vRn\{0}(u, w) =

(10.2)

for all t ∈ [0,|z|) and

0 ≤ fτ (t)

fτ (t) ≤

(cid:112)dG(0)2 − t2 + dG(0)

t

for all t ∈ [0, dG(0)). Moreover, the bounds for fτ (t) are best possible and
0 ≤ f(cid:48)

τ (0) ≤ 1/(2dG(0)).

18

Proof. By (10.2) we note that 0 ≤ fτ (t) for all t ∈ [0,|z|) and by Proposition
τ (t) for all t ∈ [0,|z|). The lower bound 0 is obtained in
10.1 we obtain 0 ≤ f(cid:48)
the domain G2 introduced in (3.6).
The upper bound for fτ (t) is attained in G(cid:48) = Bn(0, d(0)). By [12, (3.3)],
vBn(0, u) = arcsin|u| and thus

(cid:112)dG(0)2 − t2 + dG(0)

→ 1

2dG(0)

as t → 0.

Remark 10.4. As in Remark 6.4, Theorem 10.3 suggests that we could deﬁne

(cid:101)τ (u, w) = 2τ (u, w). For this distance function f(cid:48)(cid:101)τ (0) ≤ 1/dG(0).

11 Discussion

In this ﬁnal section we prove our main result and consider the estimates in
domains other than starlike.

Until now we have considered starlike domains and found estimates for the
function fm(t). Moreover, the upper bound for fm(t) is obtained only when t
is close to the origin (t ∈ [0, dG(0))), whereas the lower bound is valid also for
large values (t ∈ [0,|z|)).
Let now G (cid:40) Rn be any domain with 0 ∈ G and z ∈ ∂G. Our results hold
also in G, when y ∈ Bn(0, dG(0)). In other words, the lower and upper bounds
for fm(t) are true for t ∈ [0, dG(0)) and the results for f(cid:48)
m(0) are also true. We
initially choose 0 to simplify notation. It could be any point in G.

Proof of Theorem 1.3. The result for jG follows from Theorem 4.1, for kG from

Theorem 5.1, for(cid:101)σG form Theorem 6.3 and Remark 6.4, and for cG from 7.1.
The result for αG follows form Theorem 8.5, for δG from 9.4, and for (cid:101)τG

from Theorem 10.3 and Remark 10.4.

In Theorem 1.3 we assumed z ∈ ∂G. This is not needed, if we only consider

f (t) close to the origin. We can deﬁne for any z ∈ Rn \ {0}

Fm(t) = m(0, t z|z| ),

t ∈ [0, dG(0)).

As an application of Theorem 1.3 we obtain

Corollary 11.1. Let G (cid:40) Rn be a domain with 0 ∈ G. For m ∈ {j, k,(cid:101)σ, c}

F (cid:48)
m(0) =

dG(0)

and for m ∈ {α, δ}

dG(0)

≤ F (cid:48)

dG(0)

,

where the upper and lower bounds are best possible, and

0 ≤ F (cid:48)(cid:101)τ (0) ≤ 1

dG(0)

.

If we restrict to starlike John domains, then we can easily get lower bound
for fm(t). A domain G is C-John domain, C ≥ 1, if there is a distinguished
point u0 ∈ G such that any u ∈ G can be connected to u0 by a rectiﬁable curve
γ : [0, l] → G, which is parametrised by arclength and with γ(0) = u, γ(l) = u0
and

dist(γ(t(cid:48)), ∂G) ≥ 1
c

t(cid:48)

c t(cid:48) = 1

c (|z| − t).

for every t(cid:48) ∈ [0, l]. We can choose u0 = 0 and it is easy to see that for example
g(t) ≥ 1
We consider next monotonicity of the function fm(t). By [9, Theorem 4.8]
the metric balls Bj(0, r) = {u ∈ G : jG(0, u) < r} are starlike whenever G is
starlike. This implies that in starlike domains fj(t) is an increasing function.
Same is also true for the quasihyperbolic distance [10, Theorem 2.10], the Apol-
lonian distance [11, Theorem 3.5], the triangular ratio distance [6, Theorem 1.2]
and the visual angle distance (by deﬁnition). For the Seittenranta distance this
is not know [11, Open problem 4.10 (1)].
Monotonicity is not true for the function g(t). However, in convex domains
g(t) behaves well: there exists a point a ∈ [0,|z|) such that g(t) is increasing on
[0, a] and decreasing on [a,|z|). The next example shows that g(t) has not this
property in starlike domains.
Example 11.2. We show that g(t) misbehaves in the domain

for z = 1 ∈ ∂G. G is not strictly starlike, but by replacing line segments
[al, al/|al|] with angular domains Sαl,al,al/|al|, where αl is small enough, we
could construct a strictly starlike domain with the same eﬀect. We stick to the
line segment version to make the computation easier to follow. We demonstrate
that on each interval [1− 2−l, 1− 2−(l+1)] the function g(t) obtains its maximum
in (1 − 2−l, 1 − 2−(l+1)) and g(1 − 2−1) > g(1 − 2−(l+1)). This means that g(t)
has inﬁnitely many local maxima and minima.
Let us ﬁx l ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . .}. Now g(1−2−l) = 2−(l+1) and thus g(1−2−(l+1)) =
2−(l+2) < g(1 − 2−l). We show that for bl = 1 − 7
g(bl) > g(1 − 2−l).

By construction of G it is clear that

g(bl) = min{|ble1 − al|, d(ble1, (al, al/|al|]),|ble1 − al+1|}.

Example 11.2.

By geometry we have

d(ble1, (al, al/|al|]) ≥ 2−(l+1) = g(1 − 2−l).

Inequalities (11.4) and (11.5) imply (11.3) and thus g(t) misbehaves (it has
(cid:52)
inﬁnitely many local maxima and minima).
