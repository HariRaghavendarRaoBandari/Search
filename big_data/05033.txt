Fractional Sobolev Spaces and Bounded Variation Functions

M. Bergounioux∗, A. Leaci†, G. Nardi‡

March 17, 2016

Abstract

In this paper, we investigate the 1D Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative to
make the connection between the so called fractional Sobolev spaces and the classi-
cal spaces of functions of bounded variation whose derivatives are not functions but
measures, BV and SBV .

Introduction

The aim of this work is to investigate the fractional derivative concepts and make the
connection between the related (so called fractional) Sobolev spaces and the spaces of
functions of bounded variation whose derivatives are not functions but measures. There
are two main deﬁnitions of fractional diﬀerentiation whose connections are not clear (to
our knowledge). The fractional derivative in the sense of Gagliardo is not explicitely
deﬁned (almost everywhere for example) but through the setting of fractional Sobolev
Spaces and the underlying norm. It is, in some sense, a global deﬁnition which can be
easily handled via the Fourier transform. The second approach is based on the Riemann-
Liouville fractional derivative (in short RL) and may be pointwise deﬁned. We choose to
focus on the RL derivative : there are many variants of the fractional derivatives/integrals
deﬁnition as the Grunwald-Letnikov, Caputo, Weyl ones [8, 9, 17] but the RL derivative
can be considered as a generic one. For a complete study of these derivatives one can
refer to the book by Samko and al. [20]. Moreover, in [23], the connection is made with
metric and measure spaces, in particular the Hausdorﬀ measure. We decided to use this
derivative concept because it seems more adapted to applications than the Gagliardo one.
The RL derivative is widely used by physicists [25, 26], in automatics, control theory and
image processing as well, especially to deal with image enhancement and texture analysis
(see [18] for example); in [16] calculus of variations problem where the cost functional
involves fractional derivative are investigated. Nevertheless, the context is often a discrete
one and there is not much analysis (to our knowledge) in the inﬁnite dimensional setting.
In particular, the link between the classical spaces of bounded variation functions and
the fractional Sobolev spaces is not clear. The paper by Schmitt and Winkler[21] seems
to be a pioneer work to compare the BV space and the fractional Sobolev spaces (in the
Gagliardo sense but not in the RL sense). Indeed, the concept of fractional Sobolev spaces

is not much developed for the RL derivative. One can refer to [6, 14, 15] however. Here we
consider the 1D case and the paper is organized as follows: next section is devoted to the
presentation of the two main approaches with a special focus on the Riemann-Liouville
fractional derivative. We recall the main usual tools in this section. In section 3, we deﬁne
RL-fractional Sobolev spaces W s,1(a, b) and give basic properties. In the last section, we
perform a comparison between these fractional Sobolev spaces and the classical spaces BV

and SBV . In particular we prove that SBV ⊂ Ts∈(0,1)

W s,1 and Ts∈(0,1)

W s,1 \ BV 6= ∅ .

2 Fractional Calculus and Fractional Sobolev Spaces

In this section we present the two main (diﬀerent) deﬁnitions of fractional Sobolev spaces
that we can ﬁnd in the literature. We are in particular interested to the case where the
diﬀerentiation order is s ∈ [0, 1) in order to study the fractional spaces between L1 and
W 1,1 and their relationship with BV . We recall that

In the sequel, we consider the 1D framework; therefore

W 1,1(a, b) :=(cid:8)u ∈ L1(a, b) | u′ ∈ L1(a, b)(cid:9) .

W 1,1(a, b) ⊂ C(a, b),

the space of continuous functions on [a, b] (see [2, 5] for example) and

∀u ∈ W 1,1(a, b), ∀y ∈ [a, b]

kukL∞ ≤ |u(y)| + ku′kL1 .

2.1 Gagliardo’s fractional Sobolev Spaces

This section is devoted to recalling the classical deﬁnition of fractional Sobolev spaces:

Deﬁnition 2.1 (Gagliardo’s spaces) Let s ∈ (0, 1). For any p ∈ [1, +∞) we deﬁne the
following space:

W s,p

G (a, b) =(u ∈ Lp(a, b) :

|u(x) − u(y)|

|x − y|

1

p +s

∈ Lp([a, b] × [a, b])) .

(2.1)

This is a Banach space endowed with the norm

kukW s,p

G (a,b) ="Z[a,b]

|u(x)|pdx + Z[a,b]Z[a,b]

|u(x) − u(y)|p

|x − y|1+sp dx dy#

1
p

.

W s,p

G (a, b) is an intermediary space between Lp(a, b) and W1,p(a, b) and the term

[u]W s,p

G (a,b) ="Z[a,b]Z[a,b]

|u(x) − u(y)|p

|x − y|1+sp dx dy#

1
p

(2.2)

is the so-called Gagliardo semi-norm of u. We have in particular

W s,p

G (a, b) ⊆ Ws′,p

G (a, b)

∀ 0 < s′ < s < 1 .

2

If s = m + k > 1 with m ∈ N, k ∈ [0, 1[, such a deﬁnition can be generalized to higher

orders by setting

W s,p

G (a, b) = {u ∈ Wm,p(a, b) : Dmu ∈ Wk,p(a, b)}.

This point of view is quite related to interpolation theory (see [2, 4, 10, 13, 22, 24] for
example). Note that we are not interested in Hilbert framework so that a Fourier deﬁni-
tion is useless here. There is a huge literature concerning these fractional diﬀerentiation
methods that we cannot mention here.

2.2 Fractional integration and diﬀerentiation theory

Another point of view to deal with fractional derivatives is the one we describe in the
sequel: the generic deﬁnition is the Riemann-Liouville one, though there are many variants
that we do not consider. The point of view is diﬀerent from the Gagliardo one. More
precisely, we get a pointwise deﬁnition using fractional integrals while the Gagliardo’s
fractional Sobolev Spaces are deﬁned by interpolation and global approach. As we already
mentioned it, we decide to focus on this second type which seems more suitable with respect
to applications.

2.2.1 Fractional integrals

In what follows [a, b] is a non empty interval of R. We start by deﬁning the fractional
integral for L1-functions:

Deﬁnition 2.2 Let f ∈ L1([a, b]). For every s ∈ (0, 1) we deﬁne the left-side and right-
side Riemann-Liouville fractional integrals by setting

I s
a+(f ) : x ≥ a 7→

I s
b−(f ) : x ≤ b 7→

1

Γ(s)Z x
Γ(s)Z b

1

a

x

f (t)

(x − t)1−s dt,

f (t)

(t − x)1−s dt.

Here Γ stands for the classical Gamma function[1]. The properties of left-side and right-
side integrals are similar and we prove in the following the main results in the case of the
left-side integral I s
a+(u). The fractional integration theory has been extensively studied in
[20]. Next proposition recall the main properties of the fractional integral (see Theorem
2.5 and 2.6 in [20]):

Proposition 2.1 For any s ∈ (0, 1), the followings hold

(i) the fractional integral is a continuous operator on the Lebesgue spaces:

a+ : Lp(a, b) → Lp(a, b) p ≥ 1
I s
a+ukLp(a,b) ≤ C(a, b, s)kukLp(a,b) .

kI s

(ii) For every u ∈ Lp(a, b), with p ≥ 1, we have

kI s

lim
s→0

a+u − ukLp(a,b) = 0 .

3

(2.3)

(2.4)

Next theorem concern the mapping properties of fractional integral on Lebesgue and

H¨older spaces:

Proposition 2.2 For any s ∈ (0, 1), we get

(i) I s

a+ is a continuous operator from Lp(a, b) into Lr(a, b) for every p ∈ [1, 1/s) and
r ∈ [1, p/(1 − sp));

(ii) For every p > 1/s the fractional integral I s

a+ is a continuous operator from Lp(a, b)

into C0,s− 1

p (a, b);

(iii) For p = 1/s the fractional integral I s

a+ is a continuous operator from Lp(a, b) into

Lr(a, b) with r ∈ [1, ∞);

(iv) the fractional integral I s

a+ is a continuous operator from L∞(a, b) into C0,s(a, b).

Here C0,s(a, b) denotes the space of H¨older (continuous) functions of order s. For the proofs
we refer to [20] ((i): proof of Theorem 3.5 p.66, (ii):Theorem 3.6 p.67, (iii): paragraph
3.3 p.91, (iv): Corollary 2 p.56). The previous proposition shows that the fractional
integration improves the function regularity.

Remark 2.1 (Fractional integral of BV-functions) We point out that to ensure the
H¨older-regularity of the fractional integral we need to work with Lp-functions with p > 1.
The case p = 1 is not covered from the previous proposition. However, the point (iii)
guarantees such a regularity for bounded functions, which helps to study an important
subset of L1(a, b), namely BV ([a, b]) (see section 4). Indeed, for dimension one, every
function of bounded variation is bounded, so that we get

I s
a+(BV ([a, b])) ⊂ C0,s(a, b)

∀ s ∈ (0, 1) .

(2.5)

Next result states a stronger result for H¨older continuous functions. For the proof we refer
to [20] again (Theorem 3.4 p.65, Lemma 13.2 p. 240, and Theorem 13.13 p. 238).

Theorem 2.1 Let s ∈ (0, 1) and α > 0 be such that s + α < 1. Then the fractional
integral I s
a+ is an isomorphism between C0,α(a, b) and C0,s+α(a, b). Moreover, for every
f ∈ C0,s+α(a, b), there exists u ∈ C0,s(a, b) such that f = I s

a+(u) and

Ckf kC0,s+α(a,b) ≤ kukC0,s(a,b) ≤ Dkf kC0,s+α(a,b) .

where C, D are two positive constants.

2.2.2

Fractional derivatives and representability

There are several diﬀerent deﬁnitions of fractional derivatives. We recall next the deﬁnition
of Riemann-Liouville and Marchaud derivatives and refer to [20, 19] for a deeper analysis
of the fractional diﬀerentiation theory.

Deﬁnition 2.3 (Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative) Let u ∈ L1(a, b) and n −
1 ≤ s < n (n integer). The left Riemann-Liouville derivative of u at x ∈ [a, b] is deﬁned
by

Ds

a+u(x) =

dn
dxn I n−s

a+ u(x) =

1

Γ(n − s)

dn

dxn Z x

a

u(t)

(x − t)s−n+1 dt

(2.6)

if the previous term exists. If such a derivative exists then, for s = 0, it coincides with the
function u at every point.

Similarly, we may deﬁne the right Riemann-Liouville derivative of u at x ∈ [a, b] as

Ds

b−u(x) =

dn
dxn I n−s

b− u(x) =

1

Γ(n − s)

if the last term exists

dn

dxn Z b

(2.7)

Remark 2.2 We point out that Ds

b− is the adjoint operator of Ds

a+ in the sense to be

Example 2.1 (Power function) We consider the function u(x) = xk (k ≥ 0) on [0, 1]
and a = 0. Then for every s ∈ [n − 1, n) and any x ∈ (0, 1) the fractional derivative at x
is deﬁned as

Ds

0+u(x) =

Γ(n − s)

Γ(n − s)

Γ(k + 1)

Γ(k − n + 1)

If s is an positive integer number, then the fractional derivative coincides with the
classical one. Moreover, if k = 0 then the fractional derivative is null only if s ∈ N (recall
that Γ(1 − n) = ∞). Remark also that

Ds

0+xs−k = 0

∀ s > 0 , k = 1, ..., 1 + [s]

where [s] denotes the integer part of the real number s.

Now we focus on the case p = 1.

Deﬁnition 2.4 (Representability) A function f ∈ L1(a, b) is said to be represented by
a fractional integral if f ∈ I s

a+(L1(a, b)) for some s ∈ (0, 1).

Theorem 2.1 in [20] yields the following important result:

Theorem 2.2 [L1-representability] Let f ∈ L1(a, b). Then f ∈ I s
s ∈ (0, 1) if and only if

a+(L1(a, b)) for some

a+ f ∈ W 1,1(a, b)
I 1−s

and

I 1−s
a+ f (a) = 0 .

Moreover, there exists u ∈ L1(a, b) such that f = I s

a+u, and it holds

u = Ds

a+f .

5

(2.8)

As an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.2, we have the following result:

Corollary 2.1 Assume s ∈ (0, 1);

∀u ∈ L1(a, b)

and

Ds

a+I s

a+u = u,

∀u ∈ I s

a+(L1(a, b))

I s
a+Ds

au = u.

(2.9)

(2.10)

In the previous corollary, (2.9) proves that fractional diﬀerentiation can be seen as the

inverse operator of the fractional integration.

The converse is not true in general: a counterexample is given by the power function
xs−k (k = 1, ..., 1 + [s]) whose s-fractional derivative is null (Example 2.1). This is similar
to the classical integration and diﬀerentiation theories where the integral of u′ diﬀers from
u for a constant. However, according to (2.10), for every function that can be represented
as a fractional integral, the fractional integration acts as the reciprocal operator of the
fractional diﬀerentiation.

Using Theorem 2.2, it is easy to verify that the power function xs−1 is not represented
a+ xs−k ≡ Γ(s − 1) so that it belongs to W 1,1(a, b) but

by a fractional integral. In fact I 1−s
it does not verify I 1−s

a+ xs−k(0) = 0.

Next proposition follows from Theorems 2.1 and 2.2:

Proposition 2.3 Let α ≥ 1 and u ∈ C0,α(a, b). Then Ds
and Ds

a+u ∈ C0,α−s(a, b).

a+u exists for every s ∈ [0, α)

Let us give a comment about the relationship between Ds

a+. There are two
kind of results on the fractional integral that can be very useful to study the properties of
the fractional derivative :

a+ and I s

• The ﬁrst-one is a representability result (for instance Theorem 2.2) that gives condi-
tions for a function f to be represented as the fractional integral of an other function
u. This is quite important because it allows to easily prove that f admits a fractional
derivative with (2.8).
However, the representability of a function u (i.e., u = I s
0+ϕ) is only a suﬃcient
condition to get the existence of the derivative. The power function and the Heav-
iside function give two examples of functions that are not representable and whose
fractional derivative exists (see previous discussion and Example 4.1).

• The second kind of result are embedding results, as (2.5), that give some informations
on the regularity of the fractional integral to get the Riemann-Liouville fractional
derivative existence.

2.2.3 Marchaud derivative and representability for p ∈ (1, ∞)

The representability result given by Theorem 2.2 can be improved by characterizing the
set of the functions u ∈ Lp(a, b) (p > 1) represented by an other Lp-function

u = I s

a+(f )

f ∈ Lp(a, b) s ∈ (0, 1) .

In order to address this question we need to introduce a slightly diﬀerent deﬁni-

tion/notion of fractional derivative.

6

We remark that, for C1-functions and every s ∈ (0, 1), the use of integration by parts

(and writing u′(t) = (u(t) − u(x))′)), gives

Ds

a+u(x) =

u(x)

Γ(1 − s)(x − a)s +

s

Γ(1 − s)Z x

a

u(x) − u(t)
(x − t)1+s dt ∀ x ∈ (a, b] .

(2.11)

The Marchaud fractional derivative is deﬁned as the right term of (2.11). To extend this
setting to non-smooth functions we need to deﬁne the integral by a limit, which leads to
the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 2.5 (Marchaud fractional derivative) Let u ∈ L1(a, b) and s ∈ (0, 1).
The left-side Marchaud derivative of u at x ∈ (a, b] is deﬁned by

Ds

a+u(x) = lim

(x − t)1+s dt
(x − t)1+s dt

u(x)

if x ≥ a + ε ,

if a ≤ x ≤ a + ε .

(2.12)

Note that the deﬁnition of ψε for a ≤ x ≤ a + ε is obtained by continuing the function
u by zero beyond the interval [a, b]. The passage to the limit depends on the functional
space we are working with. In our case we will consider Lp-functions and the limit will be
deﬁned in the sense of the Lp-strong topology.

We remark that such a derivative is not deﬁned at x = a and that a necessary condition

for the derivative to exist is u(a) = 0

The right-side derivative can be deﬁned similarly by using the integral between x and b.
In the following we state the main results about Marchaud diﬀerentiation for the left-side
derivative, but we similar results can be obtained for the right-side one.

As expected,that, the Marchaud and Riemann-Liouville derivative coincide for every

s ∈ (0, 1), if u is a C1-function, and their expression is given by (2.11):

∀ u ∈ C1([a, b])

Ds

a+u(x) = Ds

a+u(x) ∀ x ∈ (a, b].;

Next results generalize Theorem 2.2 and Corollary 2.1 :

Theorem 2.3 Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ (1, ∞). For any f ∈ Lp(a, b), we get f = I s
a+(u)
with u ∈ Lp(a, b) if and only if the limit of the family {ψε} as ε → 0, where ψε is deﬁned
in (2.12) exists (for the Lp norm topology).

Theorem 2.4 Let be f = I s

a+u where u ∈ Lp(a, b) with p ≥ 1 and s ∈ (0, 1). Then

Ds

a+f = u .

Proofs can be found in [20] (Theorem 13.2 p. 229 and Theorem 13.1 p. 227, respectively.

7

Remark 2.3 (Marchaud vs Riemann-Liouville derivative) We point out that, for
every s ∈ (0, 1), we have

∀ u ∈ I s

a+(L1(a, b)), ∀ x ∈ (a, b] Ds

a+u(x) = Ds

a+u(x),

because of Theorems 2.2 and 2.4. With Theorem 2.1, this implies in particular that

∀ u ∈ C0,s+α(a, b), ∀x ∈ (a, b]

Ds

a+u(x) = Ds

a+u(x),

if s + α < 1. This is a useful result in order to study the fractional derivative because the
Marchaud derivative it is easier to handle.

3 Riemann-Liouville Fractional Sobolev space (p = 1)

In this section, we deﬁne the Sobolev spaces associated to the Riemann-Liouville fractional
derivative for p = 1. The case p = 1 is of particular interest since we aim to study the
relationship between these spaces and the spaces of functions of bounded variation.

A ﬁrst possible deﬁnition could be given by the following set for s ∈ (0, 1):

{u ∈ L1(a, b) | Ds

a+u ∈ L1(a, b)} ,

which contains all the L1-functions such that the -Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative
or order s for a given s ∈ (0, 1) belongs to L1.

Now, we noticed that if the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative of u exists (for some
s), then I s
a+(u) is diﬀerentiable almost everywhere. However, we have no information on
the diﬀerential properties of the fractional integral. These diﬀerential properties are not
completely described by the pointwise derivative though it exists a.e.
(it could be for
example a SBV -function). This shows that the previous deﬁnition is not suitable to
obtain a generalized integration by parts formula.

Therefore, to develop a satisfactory theory of fractional Sobolev spaces we use a more

suitable deﬁnition in the next section.

3.1 Riemann-Liouville Fractional Sobolev spaces

The Riemann-Liouville Fractional Sobolev spaces are deﬁned as follows:

Deﬁnition 3.1 Let s ∈ [0, 1). We denote by

W s,1

RL,a+ := {u ∈ L1(a, b) | I 1−s

a+ u ∈ W 1,1(a, b) }.

A similar space can be deﬁned by using the right-side fractional integral.

a+ u is representable. We shall describe the representable functions of W s,1

Note that this deﬁnition does not mean that u is representable but its fractional integral
f = I 1−s
RL,a+ next
(it is related to their trace).
We can make the connection with what would be the natural deﬁnition

Proposition 3.1 Let s ∈ [0, 1). Then

W s,1

RL,a+ ⊂ {u ∈ L1(a, b) | Ds

a+u ∈ L1(a, b) }.

8

Proof. Let be u ∈ W s,1

RL,a+(⊂ L1(a, b)). With deeﬁnition 2.3 (with n = 1) we get

a+ (u) ∈ W 1,1(a, b)

a+u exists a.e. and

dI 1−s
a+ u
dx

a+u =

. In addition, Theorem 1 p. 235 in [12], yields that if I 1−s

Ds
its Frechet derivative exists a.e. and coincides with its weak derivative.
This means that if u ∈ W s,1
RL,a+(a, b) then the fractional derivative Ds
belongs to L1(a, b). ✷

Remark 3.1 If I s
then u ∈ W s,1
point and its derivative is L1, then it belongs to W 1,1(a, b).

a+(u) is diﬀerentiable at every point and its derivative is a L1-function,
RL,a+(a, b). This is due to the fact that if a function is diﬀerentiable at every

In the sequel, when there is no ambiguity, we omit the index “RL,a+” in the notation.
Analogously to the usual theory we introduce the following space:

Deﬁnition 3.2 Let s ∈ [0, 1) and p ∈ [1, ∞). We denote by

W s,1

0 (a, b) := {u ∈ L1(a, b) | I 1−s

a+ u ∈ W 1,1

0,a (a, b)}.

where W 1,1

0,a (a, b) = {v ∈ W 1,1(a, b) | v(a) = 0}.

Note that u ∈ W s,1
The following result is a direct consequence of Theorem 2.2:

0 (a, b) does not mean that u(a) = 0 (it may even not be deﬁned).

Theorem 3.1 Let s ∈ [0, 1). Then u ∈ W s,1

0 (a, b) if and only if u is L1-representable.

Remark 3.2 Case s = 0. For every u ∈ L1(a, b), if s = 1 then

I 1−s

a+ u(x) =Z x

a

u(t)dt.

Then, as u ∈ L1(a, b), we get I 1−s

a+ u ∈ W 1,1

0,a (a, b) and

Ds

a+u(x) = u(x) .

This proves that

L1(a, b) = W s,1(a, b) = W s,1

0 (a, b)

if

s = 0 .

Case s = 1. This case deserves more attention. Indeed, the integral operator is not

well deﬁned for s = 0 and I 1−s

a+ u cannot be calculated explicitely if s = 1.

3.2 Main properties

Before performing comparisons between these fractional Sobolev spaces and the spaces of
bounded variation function spaces, we investigate their basic properties.

Theorem 3.2 For any s ∈ (0, 1), the Riemann-Liouville fractional Sobolev space W s,1(a, b)
is a Banach space endowed with the norm

kukW s,1(a,b) := kukL1(a,b) + kI 1−s

a ukW 1,1(a,b).

9

Proof. It is easy to verify that k · kW s,1(a,b) is a norm so that we have just to prove the
completeness. Let (un)n∈N be a Cauchy sequence in W s,1(a, b) which implies that (un)n∈N
and (I 1−s
a+ un)n∈N are Cauchy sequences in L1(a, b) and W 1,1(a, b), respectively. Then there
exists u ∈ L1(a, b) and v ∈ W 1,1(a, b) such that

L1
→ u ,

un

I 1−s
a+ un

W 1,1
→ v

Because of the deﬁnition we have I 1−s

un → u strongly in L1, we have I 1−s
that I 1−s

a+ (u) = v.

a+ (un) ∈ W 1,1(a, b), and, because of (2.3), as
a+ (u) strongly in L1 as well. This proves

a+ (un) → I 1−s

Now, we have to prove the (strong) L1 convergence of the ﬁrst distributional derivative
a+ (un))′ toward the derivative of I 1−s
a+ (u))′, where v′ denotes

a+ (u) that is : v′ = (I 1−s

0 (a, b) equipped with the norm

(a,b) := kukL1(a,b) + kDs

a+ukL1(a,b)

is a Banach space.

Proof. The space W s,1

is done as in the previous proof since W 1,1
space.

0 (a, b) is complete with respect to the norm k · kW s,1(a,b). This
0,a (a, b) = {u ∈ W 1,1(a, b) | u(a) = 0} is a Banach

Moreover, with Poincar´e’s inequality for spaces W 1,1

0,a (a, b), the norms k · kW s,1(a,b) and

k · kW s,1

0

(a,b) are equivalent. ✷

Theorem 3.4 Assume 0 < s < s′ < 1 and consider u ∈ I s′

a+(L1(a, b)). Then u ∈

kukW s,1(a,b) ≤ Cs,s′kukW s′ ,1(a,b) .

a+(L1(a, b)). Then u = I s′

Proof. Let be u ∈ I s′
2.5 p.46 in [20] we get u = I s′
s ∈ (0, s′].
As u is represented by a fractional integral of a L1-function, then with Theorem 3.1,
u ∈ W s,1

a+f with f ∈ L1(a, b). So with Theorem
a+(L1(a, b)) for every

0 (a, b) for every s ∈ (0, s′]. As f ∈ L1(a, b), Corollary 2.1 gives

Similarly, u is represented by g = I s′−s

a+ f and

kDs

a+ukL1 = kgkL1 = kI s′−s

a+ f kL1 .

Moreover, with the continuity of the fractional integral operator we get

where Cs,s′ is a generic constant depending on s et s′. Finally

a+ f kL1 ≤ Cs,s′kf kL1,

This proves the result. ✷

Theorem 3.8 The space W 1,1(a, b) is continuously embedded in W s,1

Proof. According to Lemma 2.1 p. 32 in [20] and its corollary, every u ∈ W 1,1(a, b) admits
a fractional derivative for every s ∈ (0, 1). The fractional integral and derivatives are given
by

kDs

a+ukL1(a,b) ≤ CkukW 1,1

on a, b and s).
Now, if u(a) = 0, then

∀ x ∈ [a, b] Ds

a+u(x) = I 1−s

(3.5)

Then the strong convergence of the derivative follows from (2.4).
Otherwise, because of (2.4), I 1−s
verify that

4 Comparison with BV and SBV

Let us recall the deﬁnition and the main properties of the space of functions of bounded
variation (see [3, 5] for example), deﬁned by

BV (a, b) = {u ∈ L1(Ω) | T V (u) < +∞},

where Ω is a bounded, open subset of Rd and

T V (u) := sup(cid:26)ZΩ

u(x) div ξ(x) dx | ξ ∈ C1

c (Ω), kξk∞ ≤ 1(cid:27) .

(4.1)

The space BV (a, b), endowed with the norm kukBV (a,b) = kukL1 + T V (u), is a Banach
space. The derivative in the sense of distributions of every u ∈ BV (a, b) is a bounded

Radon measure, denoted Du, and T V (u) = RΩ |Du| is the total variation of u. We next

recall standard properties of functions of bounded variation in the case d = 1.

Proposition 4.1 Let (a, b) be an open subset of R.

1. For every u ∈ BV (a, b), the Radon measure Du can be decomposed into Du =
∇u dx + Dsu, where ∇u dx is the absolutely continuous part of Du with respect of
the Lebesgue measure and Dsu is the singular part.

2. The mapping u 7→ T V (u) is lower semi-continuous from BV (a, b) to R+ for the

L1(a, b) topology.

3. BV (a, b) ⊂ Lσ(a, b) with continuous embedding, for σ ∈ [1, ∞].

4. BV (a, b) ⊂ Lσ(a, b) with compact embedding, for σ ∈ [1, ∞) .

The singular part Dsu of the derivative has a jump part and a Cantor component. The
SBV (Ω) space ( see [3] for example) is the space of functions in BV (Ω) whose derivative
has no singular Cantor component. The functions of SBV (a, b) have two components:
one is regular and belongs to W 1,1(a, b) and the other one is a countable summation
of characteristic functions. More precisely, any increasing function in SBV (a, b) can be
written as

u(x) = u(a) +Z x

a

u′(t)dt + Xxk∈Ju

pkχ[xk,1](x)

x ∈ [a, b]

where Ju denotes the (at most countable) set of jump points of u and pk = u+(xk)−u−(xk)
denotes the positive jump of u at xk. This describes all the functions of SBV (a, b) since
any BV -function can be written as the diﬀerence of two increasing functions.

15

Next example shows that there exists a SBV -function that belongs to W s,1

RL,a+(a, b)
for any s ∈ (0, 1). This conﬁrms the regularizing behavior of the fractional integral
operator and represents a preliminary result in order to prove the relationship between
SBV function and fractional Sobolev space.

Example 4.1 (Heaviside function) Let u : [0, 1] → R (a = 0), u(x) = χ[α,1](x) with
α ∈ (0, 1). We consider s ∈ [0, 1). For every x ∈ [α, 1] we get

0+ u(x) =


0
(x − α)1−s

Next result is useful to prove Theorem 4.1:

Lemma 4.1 Let {fk} ⊂ W 1,1(a, b) a sequence of non-negative functions with fk(a) = 0
and with non-negative derivative. We suppose also that

where u(a+) denotes the right limit of u at zero and Ju ⊂ (a, b) is the jump set of u.

Proof. With a simple change of variables, we can assume that [a, b] = [0, 1]. This will
make the proof easier to read. Every BV -function can be written as the diﬀerence of
two increasing functions. Then, in the following we prove the result for a SBV -increasing
function. Every SBV -function u can be written as

u(x) = u(0+) +Z x

0

u′(t)dt + Xxk∈Ju

pkχ[xk,1](x)

x ∈ [0, 1]

where u(0+) denotes the right limit of u at zero, Ju denotes the (at most countable) set
of jump points of u and pk = u+(xk) − u−(xk) denotes the positive jump of u at xk. In
particular

kukSBV ([0,1]) = |u(0+)| +Z 1

0

In particular, u can be written as the sum of two functions

pkχ[xk,1](x) .

So we have fs ∈ L1([0, 1]) and

Concerning g, by the monotone convergence theorem, we have

I 1−s

Now, because of (4.2) and (4.3), the previous series verify the hypothesis of Lemma 4.1.

(4.8)

The *-weak convergence of gs towards Pxk∈Ju

writing every function test as the sum of its positive and negative part. Finally, as the
fractional derivative is a linear operator, we get

pkδxk is obtained by the same arguments by

Ds

0+u(x) = fs(x) + gs(x) ∀ x ∈ [0, 1] .

u ∈ W s,1

Then, Ds

0+u is deﬁned at every point and belongs to L1(a, b), which implies that

RL,0+([0, 1]) for every s ∈ (0, 1). The result ensues from (4.7) and (4.8).

✷
The next two remarks point out that the fractional Sobolev spaces are larger than

SBV and give some relationship between BV and W s,1.

Remark 4.1 (Cantor function) The Cantor function is an example of increasing con-
tinuous function on [0, 1] whose standard derivative is deﬁned and null at a.e. point. It
is well known that such a function is of bounded variation but is not a SBV -function.
More precisely such a function is H¨older-continuous with exponent α = ln 2/ ln 3 (i.e.,
the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the Cantor set). Then, with Proposition 2.3 the Riemann-
Liouville derivative is well deﬁned at every point for every s ∈ (0, α). Moreover the
Riemann-Liouville derivative of order s belongs to C0,α−s([0, 1]) , and we get that the Can-
tor function belongs to W s,1
RL,0+([0, 1]) for every s ∈ (0, α). This proves in particular that
in general

(BV \ SBV ) ∩ W s,1

RL,0+ 6= ∅ .

Remark 4.2 (Fractional vs a.e. diﬀerentiation ) In [19] the authors investigate the
relationship between usual a.e. diﬀerentiation and the fractional Riemann-Liouville deriva-
tive deﬁnition. Several interesting examples are given. One of them is given by the Weier-
strass function deﬁned as

W (x) =

∞

Xn=0

q−n(eiqnx − eiqna)

x ∈ [a, b]

18

where q > 1. It is proved that W has continuous and bounded fractional Riemann-Liouville
derivatives of all orders s < 1. However, since W is nowhere diﬀerentiable it cannot be of
bounded variation.

This implies that Riemann-Liouville fractional Sobolev spaces are larger than BV ([a, b]).

Then we can state

SBV ⊂ \s∈(0,1)

W s,1 ,

\s∈(0,1)

W s,1 \ BV 6= ∅ .

5 Conclusion

In this paper we try to make connections between the two main deﬁnitions of fractional
derivatives : the local (pointwise) one whose typical representation is the RL derivative and
the global one which is typically the Gagliardo one. In view of a more precise description
of the derivative of order s ∈ (0, 1) with respect to BV functions we have also proved
preliminary results to compare SBV (a, b) and W s,1(a, b). Open problems are numerous. In
particular, it remains to strongly connect the Riemann-Liouville theory with the Gagliardo
one. This would allow to perform comparison between W s,1(a, b) and Besov-spaces for
example. In addition, we have to understand precisely how W s,1(a, b) behaves with respect
to BV (a, b) to get some information about the BV \W 1,1 functions.
In particular, we
proved that SBV (a, b) ⊂ W s,1(a, b) and exhibit a function in W s,1(a, b), that does not
belong to BV (a, b); however we still don’t know if BV (a, b) ( W s,1(a, b) (can we ﬁnd a
function in BV (a, b)\W s,1(a, b) ?) In addition, it remains to prove density results and
continuity/compactness results in view of variational models involving the RL derivative.
