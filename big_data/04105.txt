Equilibrium magnetic properties of the mixed state in type-II superconductors were measured with
high purity bulk and ﬁlm niobium samples in parallel and perpendicular magnetic ﬁelds using
dc magnetometry and scanning Hall-probe microscopy. Equilibrium magnetization data for the
perpendicular geometry were obtained for the ﬁrst time. It was found that none of the existing
theories is consistent with these new data. To address this problem, a theoretical model is developed
and experimentally validated. The new model describes the mixed state in an averaged limit, i.e.
ignoring interactions between vortices.
It is quantitatively consistent with the data obtained in
a perpendicular ﬁeld and provides new insights on properties of vortices. At low values of the
Ginzburg-Landau parameter, the model converts to that of Peierls and London for the intermediate
state in type-I superconductors. It is shown that description of the vortex matter in superconductors
in terms of a 2D gas is more appropriate than the frequently used crystal- and glass-like scenarios.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic properties of type-II superconductors in the
mixed state (MS) are discussed in all superconductivity
textbooks and in numerous papers following after fun-
damental experiments of Shubnikov and coworkers [1],
where type-II superconductivity was discovered. Refer-
ences for many of these papers can be found, e.g., in [2–4].
Therefore, it may be quite surprising that far not all, in-
cluding the most basic, magnetic properties are known.
Examples include, but are not limited to, a magnetiza-
tion curve M (H), where M is magnetic moment and H
is the applied ﬁeld, and the ﬁeld strength H (i) (also re-
ferred as the magnetic force [5], the thermodynamic ﬁeld
[6], and the Maxwell ﬁeld [7]) in samples of other than
cylindrical geometry. We will use this term for inﬁnite
cylinders and slabs in a parallel ﬁeld, i.e.
for samples
with demagnetizing factor η = 0 [8].

Here we present experimental results on equilibrium
magnetic properties of the MS measured with high purity
niobium samples in parallel and perpendicular magnetic
ﬁelds. To the best of our knowledge such data for the
perpendicular ﬁeld were not available earlier. A theo-
retical model quantitatively accounting for the new data
is developed and introduced here as well. Similar to a
model of Peierls [9] and London [10, 11] for the interme-
diate state (IS) of type-I superconductors, the new model
describes the MS in an averaged limit, that is without
detailing the samples’ magnetic structure and therefore
ignoring interactions between the structural units (vor-
tices). At low values of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) pa-
rameter κ, the new model converts to that of Peierls and

London for the intermediate state (IS) of type-I super-
conductors, valid in the limit of non-interacting normal
domains [15]. Overall, the new model accounts for equi-
librium magnetic properties of all (known) superconduc-
tors of any ellipsoidal shape (0 ≤ η ≤ 1) in a zero-order
approximation. We will show that description of the vor-
tex matter as a 2D gas of noninteracting vortices is the
most appropriate for samples of a transverse geometry.
The latter term will be used for the inﬁnite slabs or ﬁlms
in a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld, i.e.
for samples with
η = 1.

PROBLEM STATUS AND MOTIVATION
There are two equilibrium superconducting states
where samples consist of domains of normal (N) and su-
perconducting (S) phases. Those are the IS in type-I and
the MS in type-II materials. In the IS, due to positive
energy of the S-N interface, the N domains are multi ﬂux
quantum laminae, whereas in the MS, due to negative
sign of this energy, these domains are single ﬂux quantum
vortices. This quantitative diﬀerence in the ﬂux magni-
tude results in drastic qualitative diﬀerences in properties
of type-I and type-II superconductors. In particular, the
MS takes place in samples of any shape including cylin-
drical one (i.e. for 0 ≦ η ≦ 1), whereas the IS occurs only
if η 6= 0 [12]. (Under ”shapes” we mean shapes of ellip-
soids, because only ellipsoids allow performing rigorous
theoretical treatment of the magnetic properties [5].)

Due to that, signiﬁcant attention was payed to mea-
surements of the magnetization with cylindrical samples,
which, in particular, led to a fairly good knowledge of the
M (H) curve for this geometry [1, 3, 13, 14].

For cylinders at H < Hc1 the Meissner condition B = 0
allows one to calculate M (H) from either thermodynam-
ics, or magnetostatics (see, e.g.
[15]), or the Maxwell
ﬁeld H (i)(= H in this case). Recall that H (i) is deﬁned
as B − 4πm, where B is the induction and m is magneti-
zation, which for uniform samples of volume V is M/V .
However in the MS complexity of current distribution
leaves only one option to calculate M , i.e. through the
ﬁeld H (i) via calculation of an average induction ¯B. For
cylinders this was done using the GL theory (valid near
the critical temperature Tc [16, 17]) near Hc1 and Hc2
[12], and also with use of the London equation for the
vicinity of Hc1 [7, 17]. Approximate analytical expres-
sions for ¯B are available for ln κ ≫ 1 [7, 12, 17]. At
the same time it is supposed that entire M (H) curve for
any κ can be calculated via numeral solution of the GL
equations [18]. Note however, that an approximate solu-
tion of these equations (diﬀerent from the exact solution
for < 5%) is not quite consistent with this supposition,
e.g. a jump of M at Hc1 increases with increasing κ [19],
whereas in experiment [13] this jump decreases.

The situation is greatly complicated for non-cylindrical
geometry. For the experiments, it is due to a much larger
number of pinning centers in the sample area perpendic-
ular to the ﬁeld. On that reason available data on M (H)
for the MS in the transverse geometry (see, e.g., [20–22])
are strongly irreversible and, therefore, inappropriate for
judgment on thermodynamic properties.

On the theoretical side, the main complication is due to
a demagnetizing ﬁeld H(d) ≡ H−H(i). The Maxwell ﬁeld
H (i) in homogeneous ellipsoids is uniform but diﬀerent
from H [2, 5, 8].
If H is parallel to the sample axis,
relative to which the demagnetizing factor is η, then

(1 − η)H (i) + ηB = H.

(1)

Therefore
H (i) ≡ H − H (d) = H − η(B − H (i)) = H − η4πm. (2)
Thus, in uniform samples, H (d) = 4πηm. In the Meiss-
ner state the sample is homogeneous, which, together
with condition B = 0, allows one to calculate H (i) from
Eq. (1) and then M from Eq. (2) in full consistency with
experiments (see, e.g., [2]). However this is not the case
for the MS, where the sample is not uniform and therefore
η is not deﬁned and neither H (d), nor H (i) are known.

Here one can probably object by saying that there is
a well known approach [6, 23] in which H (i) for η 6= 0
is calculated from Eq. (1), then ¯B is calculated using
¯B(H) obtained for the cylindrical geometry (referred as
Be(H)) replacing H by H (i), and then both Be(H (i)) and
H (i) are used to calculate M . However, at η = 1, where
¯B = H, Eq. (1) becomes H (i)(1 − 4π) = H(1 − 4π) thus
yielding H (i) = H and therefore M = 0 regardless on
H, meaning that Hc2 = ∞. A reason of such a striking
inadequacy of this approach (apart from an error in [6])
is very simple: Eq. (1) is inapplicable for inhomogeneous
samples. A uniform sample with η = 1 is just a sample
in the N state where M is indeed zero.

FIG. 1: Data on the magnetic moment of Nb-SC sample mea-
sured in the parallel ﬁeld at temperatures indicated in the
ﬁgure. Inserts: M vs H at T = 8.60 K in two scales.

In [24, 25] M (H) for ﬁlms with diﬀerent κ and d in
the perpendicular ﬁeld was calculated using the GL the-
ory. Calculated curves strongly depend on κ and d, but
contradict the rule-of-1/2 [15] (see more about this rule
below) and hence are irrelevant.

The approach employing the London equation [17]
does not work for the transverse geometry either. The
reason is that, in the cylinders, the thermodynamic po-
tential ˜F ≡ F − BH (i)/4π = F − BH/4π is minimized
exclusively for the expense of the second term, reﬂecting
the work done by the magnet power supply when the ﬂux
through the sample changes. Here F is the Helmholtz po-
tential and ˜F is its Legendre transform, often referred as
the Gibbs free energy [11]. In the transverse geometry,
the ﬂux is ﬁxed and hence the term BH (i)/4π is absent,
making the minimization of ˜F = F impossible.

After all, inhomogeneities of the ﬁeld and of the vortex
cores near the sample surface should be taken into ac-
count. These inhomogeneities, unimportant when η = 0,
can be important for ﬁlms in nonparallel ﬁelds making
their properties dependent on the ﬁlm thickness. For
instance, in the IS they can change the critical ﬁeld of
a few µm thick ﬁlm in the perpendicular ﬁeld for more
than 50% compare to that in the parallel ﬁeld [15, 26].
An attempt to address this issue for the MS was inter-
preted by Cody and Miller in experiments with lead ﬁlms
[22], however the results obtained are inconclusive due to
strong pinning in their ﬁlms.

To summarize, (a) available experimental information
on the magnetic properties of the MS in non-cylindrical
samples is incomplete. In particular, magnetization data
are strongly irreversible and hence inapplicable for ther-
modynamic consideration and guiding the theory.
(b)
Available theoretical results and approaches are contro-
versial.
In particular, none of the existing theories is
capable to address the properties of samples with η = 1.
Progress toward solution of this fundamental problem is
the goal of our work, which results are presented below.

EXPERIMENTAL

Fabrication of the pinning free samples, being very
challenging for type-I materials [2, 15], is even more diﬃ-
cult for type-II superconductors, since most of them are
alloys with inevitably signiﬁcant pinning [1, 6]. A single
crystal sample is a solution, but since we also need a ﬁlm
for veriﬁcation of dependencies of the properties on the
sample thickness, such a solution is not complete.

Nb is known as a well veriﬁed intrinsic type-II super-
conductor [14, 27], hence it is a material from which one
can hope to fabricate the pinning free ﬁlms. On this
reason Nb was chosen for our samples. However Nb is
also known as a getter [14]. Due to that, our ﬁrst ﬁlms,
deposited via magnetron sputtering and having residual
resistivity ratio RRR ≈ 70, were still insuﬃciently clean.
A Nb ﬁlm sample (Nb-F) used in this work was grown
on sapphire via Electron cyclotron resonance technique
(ECR) [28]; its RRR = 640, the size is 4×6 mm2 and
d = 5.7µm. This is a record pure niobium ﬁlm, of the
same purity as indium ﬁlms in studies of the IS [15, 26].
More about ECR grown Nb ﬁlms can be found in [29].

Another sample (Nb-SC) was a single crystal Nb pro-
vided by Surface Preparation Laboratory, Netherlands.
It was a one side polished disc Ø7 mm × 1 mm.
However there is one more issue with Nb samples. A
driving force to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium in
inhomogeneous samples is the S-N surface tension [15],
which magnitude in type-II Nb is signiﬁcantly less than
that in type-I In. This could require even more pure
Nb samples, but fortunately pinning weakens with tem-
perature T . Speciﬁcally, both our samples are close to
pinning-free at T & 8 K. For this reason, we mostly dis-
cuss the data obtained at high temperatures.

The magnetic moment was measured using Quantum
Design MPMS system. Data obtained with Nb-SC sam-
ple in the parallel ﬁeld are shown in Fig. 1 with typi-

cal high-temperature data shown in the inserts. At the
Meissner state, all data agree with each other. Hence
the sample was well aligned with the ﬁeld and the ﬂux
trapped at the ascending ﬁeld was low, which allows to
calculate the thermodynamic critical ﬁeld Hc [13]. A
sample volume calculated from M (H) in the Meissner
range agrees with that measured directly within 5% er-
ror, indicating that ηk ∼ 10−2 and therefore η⊥(=1−2ηk)
is close to unity [8]. Here ηk and η⊥ are the demagnetiz-
ing factors in the parallel and the perpendicular ﬁelds.

The phase diagram of Nb-SC sample is shown in Fig. 2
with the data for M vs T at Earth ﬁeld shown in the
insert. Tc of this sample is 9.20 K; κ (=Hc2/√2Hc [12])
is 1.3 near Tc and up to 1.6 at 2 K.

The phase diagram of Nb-F sample is shown in Fig. 3,
where the original magnetization data are shown in the
insert. The sample volume was determined from the
slope of M (H) at the Meissner state; its uncertainty is
10%. Tc = 9.25K and κ is 0.8 near Tc up to 1.1 at 2 K.
Experimental data for the magnetic moment obtained
with Nb-SC and Nb-F samples in the perpendicular ﬁeld
at high temperatures are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respec-
tively. The data are reversible over more than half of
the ﬁeld range of the MS. Therefore, in this diapason,
the sample is in the equilibrium state. The equilibrium
M (H) is linear, and its extrapolation (shown by the dash-
dot green line) to H = 0 yields 4πM (0)/V close to −Hc1
(shown by the red star). The validity of such an extrap-
olation is supported by the rule-of-1/2: the area above
the green line equals to the condensation energy H 2
c V /8π
(=1/2 in coordinates 4πM/HcV vs H/Hc), calculated
from the data obtained in the parallel ﬁeld.

Comparing Figs. 4 and 5 with Figs. 4 and 5 in [15],
one can notice a striking similarity in M (H) for the MS
and the IS. However there are also important diﬀerences:
in the IS M (0)/V and the critical ﬁeld strongly depend

M (0) = −Hc1V /4π or 4πM (0)/V = −Hc1. Left and right

on the sample thickness, whereas for both our samples
4πM (0)/V is close to −Hc1 and Hc2⊥ = Hc2k, where
Hc2⊥ and Hc2k are the critical ﬁelds in the perpendicular
and the parallel geometries, respectively. Nevertheless,
it was important to ensure that our samples are indeed
type II superconductors. The most directly it can be
done measuring the ﬂux in N domains.

In the MS ¯B = nΦ0 [7], where a planar density n =
N/A is a number of ﬂux lines N passing through the area
A. In the transverse geometry ¯B = H and therefore

n = H/Φ0.

(3)

Hence, n(H) allows one to determine the ﬂux in the N

domains and therefore the type of a superconductor.

With this in mind we probed the ﬁlm sample with
a scanning Hall-probe microscope (SHPM) [30]. The
scanned area was 7.6 µm×7.6 µm. To achieve better res-
olution determined by a contrast of the ﬁeld inside and
outside the ﬂux lines, the SHPM images were taken at

tions of Fig. 4 for details.

low H. At these ﬁelds pinning is not small and therefore
the equilibrium triangular structure of the vortex ensem-
ble can be damaged. Typical images taken at T = 5.0
and 9.15 K are shown in Fig. 6.

A graph for n − n0 = (N − N0)/A vs H is shown in
Fig. 7. Here N0 is an adjustable parameter reﬂecting oc-
casional number of the lines in the scanned area at Earth
ﬁeld due to pinning and low statistics. As one can see,
the experimental points agree with Eq. 3, thus conﬁrm-
ing that each ﬂux line carries a single ﬂux quantum Φ0.
Since κ of our single crystal sample is greater than that
of the ﬁlm, we conclude that our samples are classical
type-II superconductors with Abrikosov vortices [12].

THEORETICAL

The problem of the magnetic properties of inhomoge-
neous superconductors was for the ﬁrst time addressed by
Peierls [9] and F. London [10, 11] for the IS. Both authors
solved it in an averaged limit, in which the nonuniform
induction B and the magnetization m are replaced by
averaged ¯B and ¯m, respectively.
In such a description
the demagnetizing factor η is the same as that for the
uniform sample. The key element in the Peierls-London
model is an assumption that H (i) = Hc in the entire

5

range of the IS, justiﬁed by a paradigm on instability of
the N phase when H (i) < Hc. Note, however, that this
paradigm is valid only for the cylindrical geometry [26].
The Peierls-London model is valid for thick samples
[2, 15, 26], i.e. when the surface related inhomogeneities
can be neglected (condition identical to that for the cylin-
drical geometry). Since N laminae are screened in the
sample interior and interact through the outer ﬁeld, the
Peierls-London model represents a global description of
the IS in a zero-order approximation, where interaction
between the structural units is neglected.

For the MS, such an averaged model is missing, result-
ing in the absence of the global description of this state
and leaving a signiﬁcant ”gap” in understanding the MS
magnetic properties. In particular, as shown above, none
of the existing theories is capable to address the magneti-
zation curve for a slab in a perpendicular ﬁeld. A model,
presented below, is targeted to ﬁll this gap.

In Fig. 8 graphs for η = 0 represent the Maxwell ﬁeld
H (i) vs H for the cylindrical geometry. The red section in
(b) represents this dependence for the MS, meaning that
the function H (i)(H) is linear and extends from Hc1 to
Hc2. On the other hand, the experimental results for the
transverse geometry (see Figs. 4 and 5), viz. (a) linearity
of M (H), (b) Hc2⊥ = Hc2k and (c) 4πM (0)/V = −Hc1,
suggest that H (i)(H) for η = 1 is also a linear function
extending in the same range. Therefore one can assume
the linear form of H (i)(H) for all η, as it is shown in
Fig. 8b. Analytical expression for these functions is

H (i) = Hc1 +

Hc2 − Hc1

Hc2 − Hc1(1 − η)

[H − Hc1(1 − η)].

(4)

Then from Eq. (2) one obtains for M and ¯B:

[H − Hc1(1 − η)].

(6)

FIG. 7: Dependence of the ﬂux line density on the applied
ﬁeld at diﬀerent temperatures.

Graphs for these functions are shown in Fig. 9.

In type-I materials, where Hc1 = Hc2 = Hc, Eq. (4)
yields H (i) = Hc, as in the Peierls-London model. This is
easily seen from Fig. 8b: when Hc2 → Hc1, meaning that
when superconductor converts from type-II to type-I, the
graphs in (b) convert to the graphs in (a). Then Eqs. (5)
and (6) convert to formulas for M and ¯B in the Peierls-
London model as well (see [15] for the graphs). Therefore,
our model describes averaged properties of both the MS
and the IS in the limit of the non-interacting vortices in
type-II and laminae in type-I superconductors.

DISCUSSION
First, we brieﬂy stop at the rule-of-1/2 because, being
well known (see, e.g. [2]), it is not always clearly artic-
ulated in the textbooks. This rule represents the law of
the energy conservation in superconductors when M is
aligned (antiparallel) to H. Consistency with this rule is
a prerequisite for discussion of equilibrium properties.

In the general case, this law reads that, at constant
T , the total free energy ˜FM (deﬁned as M = −∇H ˜FM )
of any singly connected superconductor in a dc magnetic
ﬁeld H of any orientation is

˜FM (H) = ˜FM (0) − Z MdH = Fn0 −

H 2

c V
8π − Z MdH,(7)

where Fn0 is Helmholtz free energy of the N state in zero
ﬁeld. Eq. (7) explicitly shows that, (a) the total free en-
ergy in the N state (= Fn0) is independent on the applied
ﬁeld since magnetic permeability µ of this state is unity,
and (b) a source of the magnetic energy EM of super-
conductors (the last term in Eq. (7)) is the condensation
energy. Finiteness of the latter makes transition to the
N state a mandatory property of any superconductor [8].
As one can see from Fig. 9a, the area under the graphs
M (H) for diﬀerent η is the same, meaning that if the
magnetic moment is calculated for diﬀerent orientations
of the applied ﬁeld, the sample condensation energy is
the same, as it must be. Therefore our model meets the
rule-of-1/2 and we can proceed to discussion.

Comparing the modeled magnetization curve for η = 1
in Fig. 9a with the experimental data in Figs. 4 and 5,
one can see that for the transverse geometry the model
is quantitatively consistent with experiment.

case all tunings are performed keeping maxim possible
number of vortices and therefore minimum ﬂux passing
through them, i.e. Φ0. Then the vortex density n is
as that in Eq. (3) and parameter of the most eﬀectively
packed triangular vortex lattice b = (2Φ0/√3H)1/2.

Important that n and b are as such not due to the
minimization of the free energy F (as it takes place for the
same geometry in the IS [26]), but due to the symmetry
and the ﬂux conservation and, hence, do not depend on
the sample thickness d. Figuratively, choosing Φ0 for the
ﬂux magnitude in the vortices, the sample gives itself to
the hands of the supreme power, the symmetry, hence
losing control over anything.

On the other hand, as soon as vortices in the transverse
geometry do not interact, the sample magnetic energy is
a simple sum of the free energies of the individual ﬂux
lines ǫd, where ǫ is energy of the line per unit length.
Therefore, taking into account that H = ¯B = nΦ0 =
N Φ0/A and using Eq.(5) with η = 1 one obtains

Comparing ǫ at Hc1 in the cylindrical geometry
(Φ0Hc1/4π [6, 7, 17, 18]) with Eq.(9), we see that ǫ in the
transverse geometry at H → 0 when H (i) = Hc1 equals
to ǫ in the cylinder, as it must be. At higher ﬁeld, ǫ de-
creases becoming Φ0Hc1/8π at H=Hc2, where it yields

states, respectively. The demagnetizing factors η are related
to a long cylinder in a parallel ﬁeld (η = 0), to a long cylin-
der in a perpendicular ﬁeld (1/2) and to an inﬁnite slab in a
perpendicular ﬁeld (1).

c is more general than it looked till now.

Next, since the area under the graphs in Fig. 9a equals
to H 2
c /2, we see that Hc is the geometrical mean of Hc1
and Hc2, which is consistent to a rule known for the
extreme type-II limit [18]. This suggests that the rule
Hc1Hc2 ≈ H 2
Further, as shown by Andreev [31], in the IS H (i) is the
Maxwell ﬁeld and hence the induction in the N domains
Bn = µH (i), since µ of the N phase is unity. Extend-
ing this consideration to the MS [17], one can state that
H (i) is the Maxwell ﬁeld in the vortex cores. Therefore
our model suggests that Bn in the vortex cores increases
from Hc1 at H = (1 − η)Hc1 to Hc2 at H = Hc2 and
the structure of individual vortices (in suﬃciently thick
samples) does not depend on the sample shape (η).

However there is an obvious problem.

In Fig. 9 the
linear graph M (H) for η = 0 (cylindrical geometry) dif-
fers from the experimental curve, showing a nonlinear
increase near Hc1 (see, e.g., Fig. 1 or [14]). A theoretical
description of this feature in M (H) requires accounting
interaction between vortices [17]. In our model vortices
do not interact, which explains this diﬀerence.

A question then arises, whether such a model is needed,
if the vortices interact [6, 7, 17, 18]? The same ques-
tion can be formulated as: Why the experimental graphs
M (H) in Figs. 4 and 5 are identical to that in the model
of noninteracting vortices in Fig. 9a? A possible answer
for the both formulations is: Because in the transverse
geometry an interaction between the vortices vanishes.

Any superconductor of the transverse geometry passes
through the ﬁeld and optimizes the currents to minimize
its magnetic energy and therefore the total free energy
˜FM . However result of this optimization is radically
diﬀerent in type-I and type-II superconductors. Type-
I samples tune a period of the laminar structure, the
fraction of the normal phase and induction inside it, as
well as the currents and the laminae shape near the sur-
faces, all together leading to a strong dependence of the
magnetic properties on the sample thickness d [15, 26].

No doubts that all these degrees of freedom are also
available for type-II superconductors, but owing to the
gain received from the negative interface energy, in this

of EM clearly indicates that the thermodynamic critical
ﬁeld Hc is a root mean square value of the induction at
Hc2. Having exact sense for thick type-I superconduc-
tors [2, 15], this side of Hc was not known for type-II
materials.

Therefore, the vortex matter in samples of the trans-
verse geometry can be viewed as a peculiar 2D ideal gas
where a role of pressure P is taken by the applied ﬁeld
H and the equation of state is given by Eq. (3).

Indeed, similar to the gas, which isothermal compress-
ibility ρ−1(∂ρ/∂P )T = 1/P (ρ is the gas density), the
vortex gas is highly compressible and its “compressibil-
ity” n−1(∂n/∂H)T = 1/H. Similar to the gas, where the
slope of ρ vs P is determined by the Boltzmann constant,
in the “vortex gas” the slope of n vs H is determined by
the fundamental constant Φ0. But, contrary to the gas,
properties of the vortex matter do not depend on tem-
perature. Therefore vortices in the slab in the perpendic-
ular ﬁeld can be treated as a gas at zero temperature and
hence with zero entropy, which makes this gas ordered.
Comparing the gas-like scenario with solid-like pictures
[18, 32], one can see that the former is more appropriate
for the vortex matter since a primary property of solids,
rigidity, is absent in the vortex ensemble. Extending this
analogy, the vortex matter in samples with η 6= 1 can be
viewed as a ”real gas”, where interactions are the most
signiﬁcant for η = 0.

Finally, the near-surface inhomogeneities, like in the
Peierls-London model, are not included in our model of
the zero-order approximation. But, contrary to the IS,
where eﬀects of these inhomogeneities were noticed al-
ready in 2 mm thick samples [33], such eﬀects were not
found in the reported experiments. This can be explained
by a ﬁner pattern of these inhomogeneities (compare im-
ages in Fig. 6 with those in [26]) and by the absence of
the factor of symmetry in the IS, leading to the condition
Hc2⊥ = Hc2k in the MS. Therefore, the surface eﬀects in
the MS can be expected in thinner samples and they
should diﬀer from those in the IS, hence constituting an
important problem of fundamental superconductivity.

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

Equilibrium properties of the mixed state in type-II
superconductors were studied with high purity bulk and
ﬁlm niobium samples with zero and unity demagnetizing
factor η. A magnetization curve of the samples with η=1
was obtained for the ﬁrst time. It was found that exist-
ing theories are not capable to describe these new data.
A theoretical model successfully addressing this problem
was developed and experimentally validated.

The new model describes magnetic properties of the
mixed state in a zero order approximation where inter-
actions between vortices are ignored. It is applicable to
samples with any η without limitation in magnitude of
the Ginzburg-Landau parameter κ. The model is quanti-
tatively consistent with the data obtained for the samples
with η = 1, thus indicating that the interaction between
vortices in such case is vanishing. A new formula for the

7

line tension of vortices valid in the entire ﬁeld range of
the mixed state is obtained.
It is shown that the root
mean square value of the induction at the applied ﬁeld
H → Hc2 is the thermodynamic critical ﬁeld Hc. At low
κ the model converts to that of Peierls and London for
the intermediate state in type-I superconductors, valid in
the limit of non-interacting laminae.

It is shown, that visualization of the vortex matter as
an ordered 2D gas at zero temperature is more appropri-
ate than frequently used solid-like scenarios. Since the
vortices in the samples with η = 1 do not interact, the
“vortex gas” in such samples is ideal. For η 6= 1 ac-
counting for the vortex interaction is important for the
description of the magnetic properties beyond the zero-
order approximation.

It is shown that eﬀects of the surface related inhomo-
geneities diﬀer from those in the intermediate state in
type-I superconductors, but speciﬁc form of these eﬀects
remain to be revealed.
Investigation of these eﬀects is
important for further progressing in understanding prop-
erties of type-II superconductors.
