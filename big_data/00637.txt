Abstract. Strong ﬁeld gravitational lensings are dramatically disparate from those in the
weak ﬁeld by representing relativistic images due to light winds one to inﬁnity loops around a
lens before escaping. We study such a lensing caused by a charged Galileon black hole, which
is expected to have possibility to evade no-hair theorem. We calculate the angular separations
and time delays between diﬀerent relativistic images of the charged Galileon black hole. All
these observables can potentially be used to discriminate a charged Galileon black hole from
others. We estimate the magnitudes of the observables for the closest suppermassive black
hole Sgr A*.
It is found that when the scalar ﬁled in the Galileon is weakly coupled to
the gravitational ﬁeld and it is “low-speed”, the charged Galileon black hole can possibly be
distinguished from a Reissner-Nordström black hole.

Strong ﬁeld gravitational lensings have received much attention in recent years because they
are dramatically disparate from those in the weak ﬁeld both on mathematical descriptions
and on astronomical observations. It was ﬁrstly illuminated by Darwin in 1959 [1] that light
bending by a compact body can exceed 2π and the light even can wind several loops before
escaping, which develops inﬁnite discrete images on two sides of the body closely, called
relativistic images. Relativistic images, not predicted by the classical weak gravitational ﬁeld
lensing, provide a new way to study the properties of spacetime in the strong gravitational
ﬁeld. Plenty works have done on the strong ﬁeld lensings by a Schwarzchild black hole [e.g.
2–5], by static and spherically symmetric spacetimes [e.g. 6–9] and by a Kerr black hole [e.g.
10–13].

With rapid development of advanced technology, the strong ﬁled gravitational lensings
have become appealing observational eﬀects for astronomy and fundamental physics. Rela-
tivistic images might be helpful for making a better understanding of diﬀerent black holes [e.g.
6, 14–16] and might be able to provide observational evidences for the possible existence of
naked singularities [e.g. 17–21] as well as wormholes [e.g. 22–25]. It also provides a promising
way to test fundamental theories of gravitation in the strong ﬁeld [e.g. 26–28]. However, it
is still a challenge to observe such eﬀects under the current observational capabilities. For
the most possible candidates, the supermassive black holes in our galaxy Sagittarius A* (Sgr
A*) and in M87, the angular separations between the relativistic images and the center of the
lens are respectively tens micro-arcsecond (µas) and few µas. The best ability for observing
Sgr A* is at the level of 30 µas at present [29], not suﬃcient for detection. Besides their
positions, the brightness of these images are other observables. Under the assumption that
the relativistic images can be recognized, several works have studied the light curves of the
stars moving around Sgr A* [30–32], and the S14 is proved to be the best candidate [33]. If

– 1 –

the light source is a pulsar or a celestial body with time signals, time delays among diﬀerent
relativistic images are observables as well [18, 34, 35]. A review of gravitational lensing by
black holes in the strong ﬁeld can be found in ref. [36].

One diﬃculty in describing the strong ﬁled gravitational lensing is that we cannot use
the methodology of small deﬂection angle approximation which works very well in the weak
ﬁeld.
It has been proved that when a photon moves around a black hole, there exists an
innermost unstable orbit named photon sphere [37, 38]. The deﬂection angle will diverge
when a photon approaches the photon sphere. In order to dispose this divergence in a static,
spherically symmetric and asymptotically ﬂat spacetime, one way is to expand the function
of the deﬂection angle near the photon sphere and obtain an approximate analytical solution
[3, 6]. The method can give the deﬂection angle in the strong deﬂection limit (SDL) [36]. A
logarithmic approximation is used to solve the deﬂection angle integral, which could make
the formula conciser in presentation and easier to handle than other kinds of approximations
[1, 8, 39–41]. A lens equation is also needed to deﬁne the geometrical relationships among
the observer, the lens, the source and the images.

Thus, if a speciﬁc spacetime and a lens equation are both known, the observables, includ-
ing the positions, magniﬁcations and time delays of relativistic images, can be analytically
deduced in the SDL, whose coeﬃcients may vary in alternative theories of gravity. Although
observations and experiments have proven the validation of Einstein’s general relativity (GR)
[42, 43], it seems that the theory might be incomplete. It is diﬃcult for GR to explain the
ﬂat rotation curves of spiral galaxies [44–46] without introducing dark matter and the present
acceleration of the Universe [47, 48] without dark energy. Nevertheless, the physical nature
of dark matter and dark energy remains still unknown. Another way to solve the problems
is to modify the theory of gravity and these modiﬁed theories can generate interesting astro-
physical and cosmological consequences [49]. Strong ﬁeld gravitational lensings can provide a
possible way to test and distinguish theoretical predictions in the vicinity of a compact body
by these modiﬁed theories of gravity and GR [e.g. 50–68]. In this work, we will study the
string ﬁeld lensing in the SDL by a charged Galileon black hole.

Galileon model was recently proposed as a scalar-ﬁeld theory [69–73] and its Lagrangian
contains second-order derivatives of the scalar ﬁeld, which leads to equations of motions
of second order.
It also turns out to be equivalent to the Horndeski theory in the 1970s
[74]. On the largest scale, Galileon can explain the present cosmological acceleration without
introducing dark energy, which make the theory attractive in cosmology [75–77]. Meanwhile,
Galilen can hide its eﬀects from the Solar System tests by the Vainshtein screening mechanism
[78–80] so that the parameterized post-Newtonian limit of Galilen is consistent with the
one of GR [81].
It makes Galileon black holes as important testbeds due to their strong
gravitational ﬁelds. In fact, a black hole in the Galileon ﬁeld is expected to have possibilities
to evade the no-hair theorem and maintain non-trivial hairs, because the time information in
the time dependent scalar ﬁeld could be saved under the Galileon shift symmetry, although
the hairs are perhaps unstable for static black holes [82] or under perturbations [83]. Black
hole solutions with a time-dependent Galileon have been found [84] and charged Galileon
black holes solutions coupled with an Abelian gauge ﬁeld have also been worked out [85]. It
was pointed out [86] that a positional oﬀset between the stellar center and the centric black
hole in a galaxy in Galileon theory might exist for detection, while strong ﬁeld gravitational
lensing by a Galileon black hole may provide another way for testing this theory.

In this work we will study the strong ﬁeld lensing by a charged Galileon black hole [85]
in the SDL [6, 34]. In section 2, the spacetime of the charged Galileon black hole is brieﬂy

reviewed for completeness. The lens equation with asymptotically ﬂat approximation and the
assumption of the source location are dicussed in section 3. The strong ﬁeld lensing by the
charged Galileon black hole in the SDL is calculated in section 4. The observables of such
a lensing, including the positions, the brightness and time delays between relativistic images
can be found in section 5. Some estimations of observables for Sgr A* and comparisons of
the results between the charged Galileon black hole and a Reissner-Nordström black hole are
also been given. Finally, in section 6, we summarize our results and discuss their implication.

2 Spacetime of a charged Galileon black hole

The spacetime of the charged Galileon black hole will be brieﬂy reviewed for completeness
in this section, which only covers necessary information for our following work. More details
about charged Galileon black holes can be found in ref. [85]. We consider a Galileon action
as [85]

where the action S is a function of the metric tensor gµν , the scalar ﬁeld φ and the magnetic
potential of the standard Maxwell gauge ﬁeld Aµ; g = det(gµν ) is the determinant of the
metric tensor gµν ; R is the Ricci scalar; Λ is the cosmology constant; Fµν ≡ ∂µAν − ∂νAµ is
the covariant tensor of the gauge ﬁeld strength and F µν is the contravariant term; Gµν is the
Einstein tensor; and T (M )

as

∇ is the nabla operator; ǫ, γ and η are constants. ǫ indicates the non-minimal kinetic coupling
between the scalar ﬁeld and the gravity, γ is a coupling constant of the gauge ﬁeld to the
scalar ﬁeld, and η represents the self-coupling of the scalar ﬁeld. The case of ǫ = 0, γ = 0
and η = 1/2 corresponds to the minimally coupled situation.

In order to obtain solutions of black holes, some assumptions are needed and they are

Aµdxµ = A(r)dt − P cos θdϕ.

Here, q is the linear coeﬃcient of time and P is a constant.

The ﬁeld equations given by variation of the action can be solved with the above assump-
tions. Indeed, several solutions were found in ref. [85]. Among them, one phenomenologically
interesting case is γ = 0, where the Maxwell ﬁeld is not coupled to the scalar Galileon ﬁeld.
With additional assumption η = Λ = 0, a perturbative solution can be found as [85]

and it is assumed that the magnetic charge P and the electric charge Q are small so that
|Γ| ≪ r2. The metric (2.6) is asymptotically ﬂat and diﬀers from the Reisser-Nordström
one because of h(r) 6= f (r). It can be checked that when Γ = 0, the metric (2.6) returns
to the Schwarzschild one. Another feature can be found that Γ < 0 if ǫ < 2
In the
following sections, we will study the strong ﬁeld lensing by the spacetime of the metric (2.6)
and investigate whether its observables can tell diﬀerence from other black holes.

3 Lens equation

In order to study the strong gravitational lensing by the charged Galileon black hole, we need
a lens equation ﬁrst to deﬁne the geometrical relationships among the observer, the lens and
the source. The exact lens equation in an arbitrary Lorentzian spacetime can be found in
refs.
[87, 88], and some works have given the explicit cases for spherically symmetric and
static lensing [7] and Schwarzchild lensing [89] without any requirement for ﬂat background
or hypothesis of the positions of the observer and the sources.

However, for the purpose of obtaining straightforward connections between models and
observations as well a more clear physical picture, we may put some approximations and
hypotheses into the lens equation. The most reasonable and easy-doing approximation is the
asymptotic approximation. It assumes the observer and the source are in a ﬂat spacetime,
while the curved spacetime only aﬀects the deﬂection angle in the vicinity of the lens. There-
fore, any other angular and distance quantities can be measured by the Euclidean geometry.
It is worth mentioning that the asymptotic approximation also requires that (i) both the
observer and the source should be far enough from the lens and (ii) the spacetime of the lens
is asymptotically ﬂat. In order to simplify the problem further, it can be assumed that the
source lies behind the lens. Generally, even in the situations that the source lies between the
observer and the lens or the source lies at the back of the observer, relativistic images can
still exist, which is called retrolensing [4, 90]; and the assumption that the source is far from
the lens can also be removed [91].

In this work, we focus on a conventional case that the source lies behind the lens. Under
the asymptotic approximation and the hypothesis of the source position, we adopt the lens
equation of ref. [2], which is

tan β = tan θ −

[tan θ + tan (α − θ)] .

Figure 1. A schematic diagram for the geometry of the observer, the lens, the source and the image.
O, L, and S respectively refer to the positions of the observer, the lens and the source. The light
emitted from S is deﬂected by L then arrives at O. I is the position of an observed image and the two
asymptotic line of the lights on the side of O and S meet at C. β is the angular separation between the
source and the lens; θ is the angular separation between the image and the lens; α is the deﬂection
angle. DOL, DLS and DOS are the projected distance of observer-lens, lens-source and observer-source
along the optical axis. The impact parameter u is the distance of L to the line OI.

Here β is the angular separation between the source and the lens; θ is the angular separation
between the image and the lens; and α is the deﬂection angle. DLS and DOS are the pro-
jected distance of lens-source and observer-source along the optical axis. Their geometrical
relationships are shown in ﬁgure 1. If the source is very close the optical axis and the photon
winds n loops around the lens before escape, eq. (3.1) can be Taylor expanded as [3]

β = θ −

(3.2)

where ∆αn = α(θ) − 2nπ. In eqs. (3.1) and (3.2), the angular separation θ and the impact
parameter u can be easily exchanged by the relationship of u = tan θDOL ≈ θDOL.

What the lens equation can hardly tell is where the light is deﬂected by the lens. As eq.
(3.1) and ﬁgure 1 shown, the deﬂection occurs at the point C, where CL is perpendicular to
the optical axis.

The lens equation can also be deﬁned in the way as ref. [92], which deﬁnes the position
of deﬂection occurring by using the symmetry of the impact parameters of the observer side
and the source side. Although it was assessed and found in ref. [93] that this lens equation
[2], the latter one
is a little more accurate for the strong ﬁeld lensing than the one of ref.
adopted in this work has the advantage in analysing the observational eﬀects for its brief
mathematical form.

4 Gravitational lensing in the SDL

Once we adopt the asymptotically approximated lens equation, the spacetime of the lens only
aﬀects the deﬂection angle α(θ), which will be calculated in the SDL.

For convenience, we rewrite the metric (2.6) of the charged Galileon black hole as

ds2 = A(x)dt2 − B(x)dx2 − C(x)(dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2),

(4.5)

where x0 is the closest distance of the photon to the black hole, A0 and C0 are the corre-
sponding values of A(x) and C(x) at x = x0. Substituting eqs. (4.2), (4.3) and (4.4) into
eq. (4.5), we can obtain the exact deﬂection angle of the charged Galileon black hole.

However, the integral in eq. (4.5) cannot be worked out in an explicit form. In the weak
gravitational ﬁeld, the deﬂection angle is a small angle and so an approximate solution can
be obtained in the weak deﬂection limit (WDL). When treating with the lensing in the strong
gravitational ﬁeld, the classical WDL is invalid. For solving this problem in the strong ﬁeld,
there are two feasible ways. One is seeking proper special functions to replace the integral
[e.g. 1, 90]. The other way is expanding the integral in the SDL near the photon sphere [2, 38].
The SDL method is valuable not only in providing an analytic representation of the deﬂection
angle, but also in physically showing behavior of photons near the photon sphere. The WDL
and SDL formulae work well in their own territories. Some strategies have been proposed to
unify the expression of the deﬂection angel from the photon sphere to inﬁnity [8, 39–41]. In
the present work, we adopt the SDL method since the strong ﬁeld lensing is focused on only.
In order to ﬁnd the deﬂection angle in the SDL, we deﬁne the radius of the photon

Following the approach proposed in ref. [6], we can have the deﬂection angle in the SDL as

The details of these calculations can be found in the appendix A.1.

Besides the deﬂection angle, time delays between relativistic images are potential ob-
servables. The time taken by a photon from the source to the observer can be decomposed
into three parts [34]

where ˜T (x0) is deﬁned as [34, 94]

The last two terms in eq. (4.13) can be easily handled since the photon is far away from
the black hole. But it is not the case for the ﬁrst term in eq. (4.13) because its integral is
divergent at x0. We can also apply the procedure proposed in ref. [34] to deal with it. The
resulting formula has the same form as eq. (4.8) and it reads as [34]

˜T (u) = −˜a ln(cid:18) u

um − 1(cid:19) + ˜b + O(u − um),

(4.15)

where ˜a and ˜b are the coeﬃcients for the SDL. It was found in ref. [34] that for a spherically
symmetric metric, there is a very important relation as

See appendix A.2 for more details.

5 Observables

After the lens equation (3.2) as well as the deﬂection angle (4.8) and the time delay (4.15)
in the SDL are obtained, we can calculate the observables of the strong ﬁeld lensing by the
charged Galileon black hole, including the positional separations, brightness diﬀerences and
time delays between relativistic images.

5.1 Positional separations and brightness diﬀerences of relativistic images

By using the lens equation (3.2), we have established a connection between the true position
of the source β and the apparent position of the image θ. The deﬂection angle α(θ) in that
equation is expressed by the SDL coeﬃcients: um, ¯a and ¯b in eq. (4.8), which can be calculated
according to the metric of the black hole (see appendix A.1 for details). Hence the position of

– 7 –

a n-loop relativistic image θn can be expressed by a function of um, ¯a and ¯b. Taking eq. (4.8)
into eq. (3.2), we can have [2, 6]

Besides the positions, another important observable is the brightness or the magniﬁcation
of the images. The magniﬁcation of the n-loop relativistic image’s brightness from the original
source’s brightness is given by [95, 96]

If we suppose that the outermost image could at least be able to separated from the inner
packed others and assume β ∼ θ∞ and ¯a ∼ 1, we can have three observables as [6]

where θ∞ is the asymptotic position approached by a set of images in the limit n → ∞,
s is the angular separation between the outermost image (n = 1) and the packed others
(n = 2, 3,··· ∞), and r is the magnitude diﬀerence between the outermost image and the
packed images. If the observables are available, the coeﬃcients in the SDL can be obtained
by [6]

the charged Galileon black hole like the supermassive black hole Sgr A* in our galaxy with
M• = 4.31×106 M⊙ and DOL = D• = 8.33 kpc [97]. We also estimate these quantities for the
Schwarzschild and the Reissner-Nordström black holes for comparison, where the Reissner-
Nordström black hole has a charge of ˜Q. It is found that, for the charged Galileon black hole,

Figure 2. The estimated observables θ∞, s and r of the charged Galileon and the Reissner-Nordström
black holes. It is assumed that they have the same mass and distance as Sgr A*. Diagram (a), (b)
and (c) represent θ∞, s and r for the charged Galileon black hole against the parameter Γ. Diagram
(d), (e) and (f) represent these observables for the Reissner-Nordström black hole against the square
of its charge ˜Q.

θ∞ is at the level of ∼ 26 µas while s is much smaller at the level of ∼ 34 nano-arcsecond
(nas). Figures 2 and 3 show how the observables and the coeﬃcients change against diﬀerent
lenses.

The metric coeﬃcients A(x) and C(x) of a charged Galileon black hole and a Reissner-
Nordström black hole have the same structure, i.e., Γ can eﬀectively be equivalent to ˜Q2, and
diﬀerence only appears in B(x). It is of interest whether observation of strong ﬁeld lensing
can distinguish one from the other. As table 1 shown, when ˜Q2 = Γ > 0, the charged Galileon
and the Reissner-Nordström black holes have identical θ∞ but slightly diﬀerent s and r. It

Figure 3. The SDL coeﬃcients um, ¯a, ¯b of the charged Galileon and the Reissner-Nordström black
holes. These black holes are also assumed to have the same mass and distance as Sgr A*. Diagram
(a), (b) and (c) represent the SDL coeﬃcients for the charged Galileon black hole against Γ. Diagram
(d), (e) and (f) represents these coeﬃcients for the Reissner-Nordström black hole against the square
of its charge ˜Q.

can be checked that θ∞ under positive Γ is always smaller than the one of the Schwarzschild
black hole with the same masses. Given the fact s ≪ θ∞, if the outermost relativistic image
is unable to be separated and all of the images are packed together, then the strong ﬁeld
lensings of these two kinds of black holes look the same.

However, an evident diﬀerence between these two kinds of black holes might appear when
Γ of the charged Galileon black hole have a negative value but ˜Q2 of the Reissner-Nordström
black hole is always positive. In the case of Γ < 0, θ∞ of the charged Galileon black hole is
always larger than the one of the Schwarzschild black hole with the same masses, while θ∞ of
the Reissner-Nordström black hole is smaller than the one of the Schwarzschild black hole (see
diagrams (a) and (d) in ﬁgure 2). As an example of Γ = −0.1 and ˜Q2 = 0.1, the diﬀerence
of their θ∞ can reach ∼ 3.6 µas (see table 1). In other words, even when we cannot separate
the relativistic images, it is still possible to discriminate a charged Galileon black hole from
a Reissner-Nordström black hole if observed θ∞ is bigger than the one of the Schwarzschild
black hole.

Separating the ﬁrst relativistic image from the packed others is a grand challenge for
observations, since the angular separation between them s is extremely small although the
brightness diﬀerence is theoretically notable. For the closet suppermassive black hole Sgr A*,
s is only ∼ 30 nas, which is far beyond the limit of current technology. But once we are able
to achieve the resolution, we will ﬁnd the ﬁrst image is closer and brighter to the packed one
in the vicinity of the charged Galileon black hole than those nearby the Reissner-Nordström
black hole (see ﬁgure 2 (b) and (e)). In a case that Γ = −0.1 and ˜Q2 = 0.1 the diﬀerence
between their s can reach nearly 15 nas, about a half of the s for the charged Galileon black

5.2 Time delays between relativistic images

Another important kind of observables are time delays among the relativistic images. If the
observer, the lens and the source are aligned, the time delay between a n-loop and a m-loop
relativistic image is [34]

Table 2 and ﬁgure 4 show the estimated time delays between the relativistic images
of the charged Galileon black hole, the Schwarzchild black hole and the Reissner-Nordström
n,m and ∆T 1
black hole, which are assumed to have the mass M• and the distance D•. ∆T 0
n,m
are both represented in the unit of GM•/c3 ≈ 21.22 s. Based on the values of m and n, we
consider six diﬀerent cases: (n = 2, m = 1), (n = 3, m = 2), (n = 4, m = 3), (n = 3,
m = 1),(n = 4, m = 2) and (n = 1, m = 1). It is clearly shown that the time delay grows
with the increment of the diﬀerence between n and m.

As discussed previously, there is a potentially important question whether the observa-
tions of time delay can distinguish the charged Galileon and the Reissner-Nordström black
holes. According to eq. (5.11), the time delay consists of two terms. The main term ∆T 0
n,m
only depends on um, whose values are identical for these two kinds of black hole if ˜Q2 = Γ > 0
(see table 1). The only diﬀerence comes from the second term ∆T 1
n,m, but it is smaller than
the main term by 2 to 4 orders of magnitude. Figure 4 (c) and (d) show the second term
of time delay between diﬀerent relativistic images. We ﬁnd that ∆T 1
n,m is only notable in
the cases of m = 1, among which the most signiﬁcant one is ∆T 1
2,1 (see ﬁgure 4 (e) and (f)).
It means that if the ﬁrst relativistic image and the second one can be separated, the time
delay between them might provide a chance to distinguish a charged Galileon black hole from
a Reissner-Nordström black hole. As table 2 shown, it seems unlikely to discriminate the
charged Galileon black hole in the case Γ > 0, while in the case of Γ = −0.1 and ˜Q2 = 0.1,
the diﬀerence between ∆T2,1 of the charged Galileon and the Reissner-Nordström black holes
is 1.14. However, it is still diﬃcult to observe the telltale term in the time delay because the
ﬁrst and second relativistic images need to be separated ﬁrst.

6 Conclusions and discussion

In this work we analyse the strong ﬁeld gravitational lensing eﬀects cause by the charged
Galileon black hole. It is possible for the charged Galileon black hole to evade the no-hair
theory. The strong ﬁeld lensing can provide an opportunity to test it in the vicinity of the
black hole by observing a set of inﬁnite discrete relativistic images near the photon sphere.
Those observations might be able to achieve in the future.

We adopt the asymptotic lens equation to describe the geometrical relationships among
the observer, the lens, the source and the images, and suppose the source lies behind the lens.
Then we expand the deﬂection angle on the neighborhood of photon sphere and get the SDL
coeﬃcients, so all the observables, including the angular separations, brightness diﬀerences
and time delays between the relativistic images, can be expressed by these coeﬃcients. We
estimate these observables by taking Sgr A* as an example and make a comparison between
the charged Galileon black hole and the Reissner-Nordström black hole. We ﬁnd that when
Γ > 0 it is diﬃcult to distinguish the charged Galileon black hole from the Reissner-Nordström
black hole by observed eﬀects.
It might be helpful if we can separate the ﬁrst relativistic
image from others and determine their diﬀerences on the positions, brightness and time delay.
However, in the case of Γ < 0, the diﬀerence is more notable. The photon sphere of the charged
Galileon black hole is always larger than the Reissner-Nordström black hole’s. For example,
when Γ = −0.1 and ˜Q2 = 0.1, their diﬀerence of the radii of the photon sphere can reach
about ∼ 3.6 µas. The diﬀerence in time delay between the ﬁrst image and the second image
can also be notable at the level of 1.14. Therefore, these cases are more attractive. Γ < 0
demands to satisfy the condition ǫ < 2
3 q−2, which means the coupling of the scalar ﬁeld and
the gravitational ﬁeld have to be weak and the “velocity” of the scalar ﬁeld q must be low.

On the possibility of observing the strong ﬁled lensing, it is a challenge to achieve such
a high resolution at present but the perspective of future observation is promising. The

Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) 1, a global network of millimetre-wave very long baseline
interferometric array, is expected to provide high-angular-resolution observation of Sgr A*

horizon scale, access & 10 µas angular scale [29]. However due to the limited number of
baselines, the current EHT array might not be able to directly image the black hole, but
provide the data in the Fourier domain, which can be ﬁtted with given geometric model and
accretion ﬂow simulations[98, 99]. The scale and the shape of the shadow of the Sgr A* can
be calculated more stringent in the future and may be able to testing gravitational theories
[29, 53, 100, 101]. But for relativistic images, there is still a long journey before detection.
Therefore, it is necessary to give an intuitive view of what the observed images will look like
through the analytical approach in the framework of GR and alternative theories of gravity.

A.1 Calculating the deﬂection angle in the SDL

[6]. For a static and spherically

symmetric black hole, its generic line element can be written as

ds2 = A(x)dt2 − B(x)dx2 − C(x)(dθ2 + sin2 θdϕ2),

Since what we actually concern is the angular separation θ = u/DOL instead of x0, where
DOL is the distance between the lens and the observer and the impact parameter u is given
by [2, 94]

the approximated relationship between x and u can be found as [6]

and P2(x, x0) can be found in eq. (A.9). The time taken by a photon from the source to the
observer can be decomposed into three parts [34]

It is assumed that the observer and the source are far from the lens, the time delay between
two relativistic images 1 and 2 can be given as [34]

where ˜T (x0) is deﬁned as [34]

where the subscript “, i” (i = 1, 2) of a quantity is the quantity of the i-th relativistic image.
With the same technique applied in the previous subsection of the appendix, the integral of
˜T (x0) can be rewritten as [34]

where f (z, x0) = P2(x, x0) and

˜R(z, x0)f (z, x0)dz,

We can obtain its value in the SDL at x0 ∼ xm and transform the variable x0 to u. Finally,
we can have [34]

˜T (θ) = −˜a ln(cid:18) θDOL

um − 1(cid:19) + ˜b + O(θDOL − um),
