Abstract

Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is widely used to noninvasively study

human brain networks. Network functional connectivity is often estimated

by calculating the timeseries correlation between blood-oxygen-level dependent

(BOLD) signals at diﬀerent regions of interest. However, standard correlation

cannot characterize the causality and the direction of information ﬂow between

regions.

In this paper, we introduce and test a new method, prediction cor-

relation, to estimate eﬀective connectivity from rs-fMRI. In this approach, the

correlation between two BOLD signals is replaced by a correlation between one

BOLD signal and a prediction of this signal via a causal linear model driven

by the other BOLD signal. Prediction correlation was applied to previously

published simulations of fMRI timeseries data, based on directed ground-truth

networks (Smith et al., (2011) NeuroImage, 54, 875-891). It was compared with

four standard algorithms, speciﬁcally, Granger, Gen Synch, LiNGAM and Pa-

tel’s Tau. Compared with the ground truth networks on which the simulations

are based, prediction correlation outperformed the other algorithms in networks

with sizes 5, 10, 15 and 50 regions of interest (ROIs). In addition, prediction

correlation is also able to analyze large-scale networks with more than hundreds

of ROIs. Testing the method on a “common driver” situation shows that predic-

tion correlation does not introduce false connections between the noninteracting

driven ROIs. Extending the result of Xu et al., (2014 IEEE ICIP, 3508 - 3512),

we also demonstrate the robustness of prediction correlation on experimental

data and demonstrate the ability to recover previously identiﬁed brain network

organizations from experimental data. These results provide an initial validation

that prediction correlation can capture causality information, the direction of

information ﬂow, and the possibility of extended temporal delays of information

ﬂow in BOLD signals. This approach not only maintains the high sensitivity to

network connectivity provided by the correlation analysis, but also achieves the

accurate estimation of connection directionality.

1. Introduction

Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has been widely used to study the

intrinsic functional architecture of the human brain based on spontaneous os-

cillations of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals (Smith et al.,

2011; Biswal et al., 1995; Yeo et al., 2011; Power et al., 2011). One fruitful

approach has been to examine the correlations between rs-fMRI timeseries at

pairs of regions of interest (ROIs) and use the correlations as a measure of

connectivity strength between each pair (Wig et al., 2011; Sporns, 2011). The

correlation method, though simple, plays a fundamental role in evaluating func-

tional connectivity in the human brain for both task-evoked networks (Sadaghi-

ani et al., 2015; Cole et al., 2014) and resting-state networks (Hipp and Siegel,

2015; Sadaghiani et al., 2015; Power et al., 2013). The relationships between

correlation and the topological properties, including small-world organization,

modular structure, and highly connected hubs, has been studied in Zalesky et al.

(2012). However, the direction of information ﬂow between pairs of ROIs and

the causality of information ﬂow cannot be derived from standard correlation

methods. Reliable insight into the direction and causality of functional connec-

tions in the brain from BOLD signals would provide substantial breakthroughs

2

in characterizing large-scale brain network dynamics.

The BOLD signal is an indirect and sluggish measure of neuronal activity.

Despite this, substantial insights have been gleaned by examining patterns of

BOLD signals as proxies for functional connectivity in the brain, and these are

consistent with more direct and invasive observations (Foster et al., 2015). At

every level of analysis, the brain demonstrates an organized network structure

(Bassett and Gazzaniga, 2011). So, even though neuronal activation occurs on

the millisecond time scale, organized and structured activation patterns are also

observed on the level of seconds, which is within the range of BOLD signals and

is important for understanding cognition. Causal information about the ﬂow of

information in the brain may be detected and estimated from the BOLD signals.

It remains critical, however, to evaluate methods of investigation against ground

truth simulation in order to validate these methods.

Numerous methods for estimating functional or eﬀective connectivity (Van

Den Heuvel and Pol, 2010; Friston, 2011) have recently been evaluated against

ground truth networks using simulated rs-fMRI data (Smith et al., 2011). Func-

tional connectivity can be quantiﬁed with a measure of statistical dependence

such as correlation, whereas eﬀective connectivity measures the directed causal

inﬂuence (Friston, 2011). In Smith et al. (2011), performance of both types of

methods across a range of measures was mixed. Standard and partial correlation

excelled at detecting the presence of a connection. Other methods for estimat-

ing the direction of a connection varied from chance (Granger) to greater than

50% accuracy (Patel’s Tau and pairwise LiNGAM). These results suggest that

novel methods are needed to estimate directed connectivity from rs-fMRI data,

particularly with a large number of ROIs, which are necessary for full coverage

of cortical and subcortical areas in the human brain. In this paper, we intro-

duce a new method, prediction correlation, to the neuroimaging community and

provide an initial validation of the approach.

Methods for estimating functional connectivity can be oriented toward esti-

mating a real number describing strength of connectivity, which might be quite

small, versus estimating a binary connectivity, which is present or absent, with

3

possibly the addition of a strength of connectivity, in the form of a real number,

for the case where a connection is present. Correlation and prediction corre-

lation, which is a generalization of correlation that we propose in this paper,

are methods that estimate a real number that describe strength of connection.

Subsequent processing can then be applied to remove week connections and/or

organize the complete network into modular networks.

As is described in the following sections, testing on simulated rs-fMRI data

with known ground-truth networks (Smith et al., 2011) demonstrates that pre-

diction correlation is not only sensitive to detected network connections, as

identiﬁed by standard correlation, but also achieves the highest accuracy on es-

timation of connection directionality among all approaches used in Smith et al.

(2011) (Section 3). In a “common driver” phenomena, when ROI 1 drives ROIs 2

and 3 but ROIs 2 and 3 do not directly interact, prediction correlation correctly
detects strong 1→2 and 1→3 connections but not 2→3 or 3→2 connections (Sec-
tion 4). Finally, extending Xu et al. (2014), we demonstrate the robustness of

this method on experimental data and that prediction correlation recovers pre-

viously identiﬁed brain network organization from experimental data (Section

5).

2. Prediction correlation

2.1. Fundamental method

In what follows, we describe a methodology for analyzing rs-fMRI data using

a generalization of the well-established correlation approach, which is to corre-

late the timeseries at two ROIs. The generalization, denoted by “p-correlation”

(“p” for “prediction”) is to replace correlation between the BOLD timeseries

at two ROIs by correlation between the BOLD timeseries at one ROI and a

prediction of this timeseries. The prediction is the output of a mathematical

dynamical system that is driven by the timeseries at the other ROI. More gen-

erally, the prediction could be based on several, spatially discrete, ROIs. In this

paper, we focus on the case where only one other ROI is used. We assume that

4

the dynamical system is linear and has ﬁnite memory and that the memory

duration and parameters may be estimated from the BOLD timeseries. If the

prediction of the timeseries is restricted to use only the current value of the

timeseries that drives the dynamical system, then p-correlation is the same as

standard correlation. Therefore p-correlation is a generalization of correlation.

Features of p-correlation include (1) the ability to indicate the directionality of

the interaction between two ROIs, (due to the fact that this prediction corre-

lation is asymmetrical between two signals), and (2) the ability to evaluate the

interaction based on casual information.

In the remainder of this section, we provide more detail on the p-correlation

approach. Consider the ordered pair of ROIs (i, j) and let xi (xj) denote the rs-
fMRI timeseries at the ith (jth) ROI. Both timeseries have duration Nx. The xj

signal is predicted from the xi signal by a linear time-invariant causal dynamical

model with xi as the input and the prediction ˆxj|i as the output. This model
can be described by an impulse response, denoted hj|i, which is zero for negative

times. We assume that the impulse response is of ﬁnite duration, with duration

denoted by Nhj|i. In summary,

ˆxj|i[n] =

Nhj|i(cid:88)

m=0

hj|i[m]xi[n − m].

(1)

The basic approach to estimate the coeﬃcients of hj|i is to minimize the least

squares cost

J (hj|i) =

Nx−1(cid:88)

(xj[n] − ˆxj|i[n])2.

(2)

n=0

We estimate the value of Nhj|i and the values of the impulse response at the same

time by restating the least squares problem as a Gaussian maximum likelihood

estimator (MLE) with a known variance for the measurement errors. The MLE

allows a trade oﬀ of the accuracy of predicting the current data (i.e., minimizing
J ), which is best done by large values of Nhj|i, with the accuracy of predicting
when presented with new data, which is best done by smaller values of Nhj|i.

There are several approaches to quantifying this trade oﬀ including Akaike in-

formation criteria (AIC) (Akaike, 1974, 1970; Sugiura, 1978; Hurvich and Tsai,

5

1989, 1993; Cavanaugh, 1997), Bayesian information criteria (BIC) (Schwarz,

1978), restricted maximum likelihood (REML) (Thompson Jr, 1962; Patterson

and Thompson, 1971), minimum description length (Rissanen, 1978) and min-

imum message length (Wallace and Boulton, 1968). We have focused on AIC

because it leads to easily computed problem formulations (Eq. 3). AIC realizes

this balancing goal by minimizing the sum of two terms, one term that char-

acterizes the prediction error of the dynamic system through the least squares
cost J (hj|i) and a second term that depends on the durations Nhj|i and Nx:

Simultaneous minimization of Eq. 3 with respect to both hj|i, which occurs
only in the J (hj|i) term, and Nhj|i determines the duration and the value of
the impulse response. The integer minimization over Nhj|i
is computed by

testing each value in a predetermined range of values, i.e., 1,2, ..., D seconds.

Then, for each value of Nhj|i, the minimization with respect to hj|i involves only
minimizing J (hj|i). Since the dynamical system describing how xi inﬂuences
xj is separate from the dynamical system describing how xj inﬂuences xi, the

approach described here can lead to a directed rather than undirected graph of

interactions between ROIs.

Once hj|i and Nj|i are estimated, the output of the dynamical system, which
is the prediction ˆxj|i, can be computed, and then the correlation of xj and ˆxj|i,
which is the so-called p-correlation, denoted by ρj|i, can be computed. We use

“correlation” and ρj,i for the standard approach (i.e., the standard correlation

between xj and xi).

Let the total number of ROIs be denoted by NROI. P-correlation is an
asymmetric NROI × NROI matrix, where the asymmetry follows the ρj|i (cid:54)= ρi|j.
Furthermore, p-correlation includes lags of the xi signal since the dynamical

system output at time n, ˆxj|i[n], depends on the input at its current and previous
times, i.e., xi[n], xi[n − 1], . . . , xi[n − Nhj|i + 1]. If Nhj|i = 1 (i.e., no lags)

6

and hj|i[0] ≥ 0 then ρj|i is the correlation between xj and xi so that ρj|i = ρj,i
and the approach of this paper exactly reduces to the standard approach. In
Section 2.2.1, we describe a constraint such that hj|i[0] ≥ 0 is always achieved.
The entire algorithm is shown in Fig. 1. The Matlab software of implementing

p-correlation is available upon request.

Specializations of the fundamental method

The fundamental method can be specialized for particular applications, often

based on what the user knows about the details of the applications. Several such

specializations are described in the following paragraphs.

2.2.1. Constraints on the least squares problems

If the user has information on the type of interactions that are present, then

this information can be used as a constraint on the least square problem that de-

termines the impulse response which is the basis of the prediction. For example,

as in the simulated data of Smith et al. (Smith et al., 2011), the interactions are

ance of the two signals, denoted by Rj,i[m]) by Rj|i =(cid:80)Nhj|i

all positive. Constraining the impulse response values hj|i[n] to be nonnegative
has implications for the values of ρj|i. Let Rj|i be the covariance of xj and ˆxj|i.
Rj|i is related to the covariance of xj[n] and xi[n− m] (i.e., the m-lagged covari-
m=0 Rj,i[m]hj|i[m].
The covariance Rj|i is the numerator of ρj|i. Therefore, if all the lagged co-
variances are positive and we require the estimated values of hj|i[m] to be
positive then we are assured of getting a nonnegative value for Rj|i and for
the p-correlation ρj|i. In the traditional functional connectivity analysis, when

−1

global signal regression is applied to rs-fMRI timeseries data, the valid inference

of negative correlations cannot be made (Murphy et al., 2009; Saad et al., 2012),

and only positive correlations are interpreted. In this situation, the nonnegative

“constrained” estimation approach is appropriate.

2.2.2. Thresholding ρj|i

Three natural methods for thresholding ρj|i are described in this section.
Even with hj|i[n] ≥ 0, it may be that p-correlation is not positive because
one or more of the m-lagged covariance values are negative. Therefore, if non-

negativity is required, we replace all negative ρj|i values by zeros. One reason for
seeking to have ρj|i non negative is mean signal regression in the preprocessing

of the fMRI data which makes it diﬃcult to interpret negative correlations.

9

However, alternative preprocessing which omits mean signal regression (Jo et al.,

2013) removes this requirement.

The previous paragraph concerned thresholding at value 0. Higher data-

dependent minimum thresholds are often used for correlation and the same

approach can be applied to p-correlaton. A standard approach (Power et al.,

2011) is to order the values of correlation and leave the top s percent of values

unchanged and set the remaining values to zero. In other words, the threshold

γ(s) is set to be the 100-s percentile of all values in the p-correlation matrix.

In some problems the interactions are known to be unidirectional, e.g., in

the simulated data of Smith (Smith et al., 2011).

In this situation, a third

thresholding method, which makes p-correlation unidirectional, is natural. The

threshold is to consider the two transpose related elements of the matrix and

set the smaller to zero and leave the larger unchanged.

All of the thresholding methods are nonlinear operation applied to the matrix

of ρj|i coeﬃcients. Each can be applied to any matrix M to give an output

matrix N , in particular, in the order of the previous three paragraphs,

where γ(s) is the 100 − s percentile of all values in M , and

The thresholding approach forms a NROI × NROI matrix of thresholded connec-
tion weights, from which the network is computed.

2.2.3. Averaging over subjects

In Smith et al. (2011), each subject is processed independently, but in many

investigations using experimental data, e.g., Power et al. (2011, 2013), there is

Just as the thresholding methods (Section 2.2.2), which are nonlinearities

that can be applied to any matrix, the averaging we use can be applied to any
family of matrices Mk (k ∈ {1, . . . , K}, where K is the number of subjects) to
give an output matrix N via N = 1
K

(cid:80)K

k=1 Mk.

In addition, it would be possible to measure the homogeneity of a cohort

of subjects by computing other quantities such as the second central moment.

If the cohort is not homogeneous then many techniques exist for partitioning

the cohort into a small number of discrete classes which are homogeneous (Do-

erschuk and Johnson, 2000) or into a small number of discrete classes each

of which has diﬀerent heterogeneity and characterize the heterogeneity (Zheng

et al., 2012).

3. Application on Simulated Data

3.1. Data source: simulated BOLD timeseries

Simulated fMRI timeseries from the laboratory of S. M. Smith are docu-

mented (Smith et al., 2011) and available on-line (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.

uk/analysis/netsim/). The simulations are based on a variety of underlying

networks of diﬀerent complexity and can be described as having three levels.

First there is a neural level which is a stochastic linear vector diﬀerential equa-

tion which produces a neural timeseries for each ROI. Second, for each ROI,

there is a nonlinear balloon model driven by the corresponding neural time-

series which produces a vascular timeseries. Third, for each ROI, the fMRI

timeseries is the vascular timeseries plus thermal noise. The current paper con-
siders the ﬁrst four sets of simulations from Smith et al. (2011), Sim1 − Sim4,
which are based on diﬀerent underlying networks with sizes 5, 10, 15, and 50

ROIs, respectively.

These synthetic fMRI timeseries were sampled every 3s (TR= 3s) and the

total duration is Nx = 60 mins. All four simulations have 1% thermal noise

and the hemodynamic response function (HRF) used in the second step has

standard deviation of 0.5 s. The simulation is repeated for each of 50 subjects.

11

3.2. Specialization on p-correlation for the processing of the simulated data

Figure 2: Block diagram describing the specialization of p-correlation for sim-

ulated data. Nonzero entries are ﬁlled by colored dots with higher values repre-

sented by “hotter” colors and lower values represented by “colder” colors, and

zero entries are left as blank in the above matrices.

The algorithm is shown in Figure 2. Given that the interactions are all pos-

itive in the simulated data, it is natural to apply the nonnegative constraint

on the least square problem so that no negative impulse responses are allowed.

Through unconstrained p-correlation is also computed on the simulated data,

looking forward to Section 3.5, the numerical results indicate that the con-

strained version is more appropriate.

As is described above, the integer minimization over the impulse function

duration, Nhj|i, is computed by testing from 1 second up to D seconds. Assum-

ing that knowledge of the behavior of a ROI over the past 15 seconds is suﬃcient

to describe its eﬀect on a second ROI, we restricted the temporal window for

directional inﬂuence between ROIs to no more than 15s, i.e. D = 15s.

Next, we consider the choice of threshold, s in Eq. 4b. We use this method in

order to exploit all of the a priori knowledge about the simulated data. Since the

underlying ground truth networks for the simulated fMRI timeseries, denoted by

aj|i, are given, the threshold value s is among our prior knowledge as is described

below. We denote ROIs that are involved in the connections of the ground

truth network as active ROIs. All connections involving the active ROIs are

such as the reverse connection in an unidirectional interaction. The value of s is

then the ratio of the number of COIs and the number of all possible connections,

which gives s = 40, 22, 16 and 4 percent for the four simulations, respectively.

An example of computing s for a 5-node network is shown in Fig. 3. For the

that do not existed in the ground truth but still are considered interesting.

Therefore, s = 6/25 for this network.

Smith simulated data, we have additional prior knowledge that the networks

contain only unidirectional connections. Therefore, as is also done in Smith et al.

(2011), we compare our estimated network dj|i, which includes the unidirectional
condition, with the ground truth network aj|i. The estimated network dj|i is
the output of Eq. 4c where the input is the thresholded network cj|i.

diﬀerentiates the performance of directional analytical methods based on their

sensitivity. The more sensitive the method is, the more true connections it can

detect. Notice that application of the threshold s leads to dj|i values that are
almost certainly far from zero or exactly zero. Computing the accuracy A after
the threshold operation tells the directionality after knowing the presence of the

connections, which enable us to evaluate the overall performance of sensitivity

and directionality of a directional analytical method.

3.4. Alternative methods for networks estimation

P-correlation and four alternative methods from Smith et al. (2011), specif-

ically, “Granger B1”, “Gen Synch S1”, “LiNGAM” and “Patel’s conditional
dependence measure”, were compared by the accuracy criteria (A), since un-
der both synthetic and experimental scenarios, these methods have been tested

and have relatively good performances among all the others (Smith et al., 2011;

Dawson et al., 2013). The computation of these methods were done by software

provided by Prof. S.M. Smith. Granger B1, a pairwise Granger causality esti-

mation method which provides the best performance among Granger causality

approaches (Smith et al., 2011; Dawson et al., 2013), uses the Bayesian Infor-

mation Criterion to estimate the lag up to 1 TR. Gen Synch S1 is a nonlinear

synchronization method with respect to the time lag 1 TR. It “evaluates syn-

chrony by analyzing the interdependence between the signals in a state space

reconstructed domain” (Dauwels et al., 2010, p. 671). The LiNGAM (Linear,

Non-Gaussian, Acyclic causal Models) algorithm is a global network model uti-

lizing higher-order distributional statistics, via independent component analysis,

to estimate the network connections. Patel’s conditional dependence measure

investigates the causality from the imbalance between two conditional proba-
bilities, P (xj|xi) and P (xi|xj). P-correlation, Granger B1, Gen Synch S1 and
LiNGAM all compute an asymmetric matrix ﬁlled with real-number connection

weights, analogous to our cj|i. In all cases, the unidirectional prior knowledge is
applied analogous to our transformation from cj|i to dj|i. For the Patel method

implemented by Smith et al. (2011), the thresholding operation was applied on

“Patel’s κ bin 0.75” matrix, while the directionality was determined by “Patel’s

τ bin 0.75” matrix.

In addition to the algorithms included in Smith et al. (2011), Ramsey pro-

posed IMaGES (Ramsey et al., 2010, 2011) and Gates proposed GIMME (Gates

and Molenaar, 2012) algorithms, which are designed for estimating connectivi-

ties based on a group of subjects. The IMaGES algorithm estimates one gener-

alized network from a group of subjects. The GIMME algorithm can be applied

both to event-related data and to resting-state data. For resting-state data,

GIMME is based on the uniﬁed Structural Equation Modeling (uSEM) model

proposed in Kim et al. (2007) and a practical automatic search procedure intro-

duced in Gates et al. (2010). While for event-related data, GIMME is based on

the extended uniﬁed SEM (euSEM) proposed in Gates et al. (2011). Though

both IMaGES and GIMME can work with a group of 1, the performance is ei-

ther similar to or less good than the best-performing method described in Smith

et al. (2011) on Smith’s simulation data. Comparing IMaGES and GIMME

with p-correlation, p-correlation can work on individual subjects directly, and is

therefore potentially useful in a clinical environment. In addition, p-correlation

can process networks with hundreds on ROIs while GIMME is limited to 3-

25 ROIs. GIMME and IMaGES estimate a single graph of interactions, while

p-correlation estimates an asymmetrical matrix which can be thresholded as

desired and/or further processed as desired using another algorithm. Therefore,

GIMME and IMaGES are solving somewhat diﬀerent problems than the p-

correlation method. Other algorithms have been developed as post-processoring

algorithms, which cannot detect connections, but only estimate direction if con-

nections are detected by other methods, e.g., correlation. Among them, pairwise

LiNGAM (Hyv¨arinen and Smith, 2013) achieved success on Smith data. Several

algorithms, such as Patel’s τ , LiNGAM and pairwise LiNGAM, chose one of the

two possible directions for each pair of ROIs. Such unidirectionality may be

appropriate in some situations. Alternative algorithms, including p-correlation,

provide strengths for both directions, where the two strengths may be quite

15

diﬀerent when one direction is dominant.

3.5. Results on simulated data

The methods described in this paper were implemented in Matlab software,

which is available upon request, and were applied to four of Smith’s fMRI simu-
lations (Smith et al., 2011). The four simulations are Sim1 − Sim4 which have
a variable number of ROIs (5, 10, 15, 50) but no confounding variables.

The p-correlation method is based on estimation of a linear time-invariant

causal dynamic model. The sample means of the duration of either constrained

or unconstrained impulse responses are 3.34s, 3.58s, 3.64s and 3.76s for the 4

simulations, respectively. By limiting the impulse response duration to 1 TR, it

was veriﬁed that p-correlation with constraint on Least Squares is equivalent to

the standard correlation as is described in Section 1. After thresholding the p-

correlations computed with the nonnegative constraint on the coeﬃcients of the

linear system, an asymmetric matrix of connection weights cj|i for each subject

was obtained.

The performance of all ﬁve methods was evaluated by the accuracy criteria
A (Eq. 5) for each subject. Fig. 4 shows the input to the accuracy criteria A,
i.e., aj|i and dj|i, for Subject 14 of Sim2.

of colors, but has diﬀerent range of numerical values.

were computed and the results are tabulated in Table 1. For all four simulations,

constrained p-correlation achieved the highest accuracy compared to the others.

The unconstrained p-correlation is less appropriate when applied to a network

with all positive connection weights. We also computed the mean and stan-
dard deviation of A for pairwise LiNGAM, which gives .566±.138, .656±.206,
.510±.119 and .506±.056 for four simulations, respectively. The result shows
the highly accurate directionality that pairwise LiNGAM can achieve in this

particular unidirectional network setting. Histograms displaying the distribu-

tion of accuracy for the ﬁve methods for each simulation are shown in Fig. 5.

The superior performance of p-correlation is demonstrated by the fact that the

bulk of the histogram is further to the right, and the left tail is less massive.

4. The performance of correlation and p-correlation on common drivers

A “common driver” situation is the case where ROI 1 drives ROIs 2 and 3

but ROIs 2 and 3 do not directly interact. The challenge is to correctly detect
the 1→2 and 1→3 connections without detecting 2→3 or 3→2 false connections.
In order to focus exclusively on this situation, we have computed synthetic data

from the three-ROI network shown in Fig. 6 and deﬁned by

Figure 6: The common driver problem.

where w[n] = [w1[n], w2[n], w3[n]]T is an independent and identically distributed
Gaussian stochastic process with mean 0 and variance I3 (the 3×3 identity
matrix). Zalesky et al. (2012) consider mathematical models of this type and

give theoretical results for correlations. The system is initialized in the steady

state and simulated for 1000 steps, Nx = 1000. We consider only a1 = a2 =

a3 = .8 (so that all ROIs have the same intrinsic memory duration) and b1 =

b2 = b3 = .2 (so that all ROIs have the same intrinsic noise power, and the

intrinsic noises are all independent). We consider the following cases: (1) no

driving: a21 = a31 = 0, (2) weak driving: a21 = a31 = .1, (3) strong driving:

a21 = a31 = .4, and (4) asymmetrical strong driving: a21 = .4, and a31 = .1.

Each simulation was repeated for 50 subjects. Let the maximum allowable

duration of the impulse response be 3 samples. By using the specialization of

p-correlation for Smith simulated data, as is described in Section 3.2, a directed

graph dj|i is estimated by p-correlation (Fig. 2) and the correlation matrix

is computed for each subject. The steady state covariance of Eqs. 6-8 is the

correlation matrix. In Case (1), the mean and standard deviation of nonzero
entries of ρj|i with constrained least squares (Section 2.2.1) are 5.384e-04±0.072.
This number becomes 0.058±0.043 when unconstrained least squares is applied.
The smaller magnitude of the results using constrained least squares indicates

that taking advantage of the prior knowledge that the weights are positive (i.e.,

a1 = a2 = a3 = .8) provides improved performance in this case. In Cases (2)

and (3), both the constrained and the unconstrained least squares achieve a

100% accuracy (Eq. 5) for each subject. In the fourth case, the constrained
or the unconstrained least squares gives an average of .800±.247 accuracy over
all 50 subjects. We also tested Nx =200, 500, 5000 for all four cases. Notice

that as Nx goes large, correlations become closer to the steady state and the

accuracy computed by the p-correlation method increases as well.

19

In addition, p-correlation estimated the correct hierarchy on the three pairs

of connection weights, which are consistent with “strong”, “weak” and “non-”

connections in the ground truth network. It also shows the correct direction of

connections in a pair by a stronger weight. The constrained least squares (Sec-

tion 2.2.1) provides a slightly superior result than the unconstrained approach.

Speciﬁcally, larger numerical diﬀerences between the zero and nonzero entries,

as well as between the asymmetric strong weights, were shown. On average

across all 50 subjects, p-correlation used an impulse response duration of 1.007

samples for all four cases for both constrained and unconstrained approaches. In

addition, in Case (3) (asymmetric strong weights), correlation mis-detected the

connection between node 2 and 3, speciﬁcally the 2-3 correlation was the high-

est correlation value among the three pairs, whereas p-correlation, for both the

constrained and unconstrained approaches, estimated this value as the lowest

of the three pairs thereby avoiding the error in the correlation results.

5. Performance on experimental fMRI data

While the tools described in this paper can be assembled into many algo-

rithms, we use only one algorithm, which is shown in Figure 7, to further char-

acterize (Xu et al., 2014), a cohort of 132 subjects from the 1000 Functional Con-

nectomes Project (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon_1000/) (Biswal et al.,

2010). We combine our p-correlation ideas with the widely-used (Power et al.,

2011, 2012; Lahnakoski et al., 2012) Infomap graph analytical algorithm (Lanci-

chinetti and Fortunato, 2009) to determine networks within the set of 264 ROIs.

As a function of the value of the threshold s, Infomap creates a variable

number of networks. Following Power et al. (2011, Fig. 1), the network stability
over a range of threshold s ∈ {2, . . . , 10} using correlations and p-correlations
are shown in Fig. 8, in which diﬀerent networks are represented by diﬀerent

colors. Similar to Power et al. (2011) (the ﬁrst ﬁgure in Fig 8), we note that the

assignment of ROIs to networks remains relatively constant over all values of

the threshold s, illustrated by the constant horizontal bands in diﬀerent colors.

Also, networks are hierarchically reﬁned as s rises. In summary, the number

of networks increases as the value of s decreases, and p-correlation replicated

the brain network organizations that were detected by correlation. The network

results are consistent with the network organizations detected in Power et al.

(2011).

6. Discussion

Standard correlation has been widely used to analyze functional connectivity

from rs-fMRI timeseries between prespeciﬁed ROIs. Prior work has shown its

simulated and experimental scenarios (Smith et al., 2011; Dawson et al., 2013).

This paper describes methodology for analyzing rs-fMRI data using a gener-

alization of well-established correlation ideas. The generalization, denoted by

“p-correlation” (“p” for “prediction”), is to compute the correlation between the

jth signal and an optimal linear time-invariant causal estimate of the jth signal

based on the ith signal. In this way, it captures additional features concerning

the interaction between two ROIs, speciﬁcally, the causality and directionality

of the information ﬂow on which the interaction depends. Based on the ﬁnite-

memory linear time-invariant causal model, p-correlation allows the memory

duration to be diﬀerent in the two directions for one pair of ROIs and also to be

diﬀerent for diﬀerent pairs of ROIs. In contrast, structural vector autoregres-

sive models (Kim et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2011) are assumed to have the same

memory duration across all ROIs. P-correlation is a generalization of standard

correlation ideas because, if the estimate of the jth signal based on the ith signal

is restricted to use only the current value of the ith signal, then p-correlation

and standard correlation have the same magnitude.

Testing p-correlation on simulated fMRI data provided in Smith et al. (2011),

the greater performance accuracy of p-correlation, which uses lagged informa-

tion from the BOLD timeseries, demonstrates the importance of causal informa-

tion which is missing in standard correlation. In our results, the mean duration

of the impulse response estimated by AIC using a search limited to a maximum

duration of 15s was roughly 4s. In these data, a search extending to 15s is not a

restriction on the maximum duration. As is described in Table 1, the accuracy

of p-correlation on the simulated data of Smith is about 0.5 (0.405 to 0.532).

While higher levels are desirable, this performance exceeds the performance of

many alternative algorithms on all four sets of simulations.

Many approaches have been introduced to assess functional or eﬀective con-

nectivity of rs-fMRI data. Smith et al. (2011) evaluated the validity of 38

approaches (Smith et al., 2011, Fig. 4) using simulated BOLD signals and a

variety of performance measures. The methods tend to have diﬀerent levels

23

of performance for diﬀerent measures, e.g., detection of a connection versus

determination of the direction of a connection. The p-correlation approach in-

troduced in this paper depends on causal dynamical models and so we focus on

this particular aspect of previous work. Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) has

been used with some success to assess causal dynamics in fMRI data by relying

on sophisticated models of neural dynamics. As discussed in Smith et al. (2011,

p. 878), most existing DCM algorithms require knowledge of external inputs

(which are not known for rs-fMRI) although some variations may not (Dau-

nizeau et al., 2009); all versions tend to be mathematically poorly conditioned;

and all versions fail to scale to networks with large numbers of ROIs which

are necessary for experimental studies. In contrast, the p-correlation approach

described in this paper scales similarly to a correlation approach for which hun-

dreds of ROIs are not a challenge (Xu et al., 2014).

Several versions of Granger causality analysis, based on multivariate vector

autoregressive modeling, have been tested and performed poorly (Smith et al.,

2011). Granger causality relies on regression and comparison of two predictions.

The ﬁrst prediction is based purely on an autoregressive model of the signal at

the ith ROI based on the past of the same signal. The second prediction is

based on regression of the signal at the ith ROI based on the past of the signal

at the jth ROI and, possibly, an autoregression as in the ﬁrst case. The sample

covariances of the prediction errors are then combined, essentially by taking

the ratio of the sample covariances scaled by integers describing the amounts

of data, to yield a statistic that is distributed according to the Fisher-Snedecor

F distribution. This statistic, indexed by i and j, is used to ﬁll an asymmetric

matrix. Although both are based upon lagged information there are important

diﬀerences between p-correlation and Granger causality. P-correlation is not a

statistic comparing two possible dependencies but rather is a statistic measuring

the accuracy of prediction using a particular dependency. The motivation for the

Granger causality statistic is dependent on the original Gaussian assumptions

on the errors when linear regression is used to describe the ROI time series. P-

correlation is based on just the sample variance of the prediction error and does

24

not have a Gaussian motivation which is advantageous if the BOLD signals lack

Gaussian structure. Multivariate autoregressive processes have been used as the

basis for generative models for complete sets of ROIs. Such models, which focus

on the eﬀect of the past on the present, can be combined with structural equation

modeling (SEM) models, which focus on contemporaneous eﬀects (Chen et al.,

2011). Other approaches to examining BOLD signal propagation using lags, as

is done in p-correlation, have been highly reproducible (Mitra et al., 2015).

In addition to the algorithms mentioned in Smith et al. (2011), which esti-

mate the directional connectivity for single subject data sets, IMaGES (Ramsey

et al., 2010, 2011) and GIMME (Gates and Molenaar, 2012) algorithms use a

group of subjects. IMaGES estimates one generalized network from a group,

whereas GIMME can reﬁne the estimate for each individual subject from the

general information estimated from the whole group. Similar to DCM’s limita-

tion on scalability, small networks with less than 25 ROIs are well analyzed by

the IMaGES and GIMME algorithms. However, their performances on large-

scale functional networks are not known. As p-correlation can work with hun-

dreds ROIs so it can be used in evaluating large-scale brain networks, and can

work on individual subjects so it potentially could be applied to patient clinical

data. Other algorithms that estimate direction after a connection is already

detected also exist (Section 3.4). While such algorithms may be useful in some

circumstances, they do not allow for situations where both directions are present

but of diﬀerent strengths.

Simulated data has lower dimensionality than experimental brain data. For

instance, in the simulation, connections are all unidirectional while most neural

connections are bidirectional. Additionally, in the simulations, most connections

had a value of exactly zero. While this simulated data is not a perfect test

of p-correlation, we leveraged the same data used in Smith et al. (2011) for

comparison with other published metrics, providing a broader context for these

ﬁndings.

In order to focus on the challenges of a “common driver”, we have produced

additional synthetic data for the three ROI network of Figure 6 in which one

25

ROI drives two other ROIs but the two other ROIs do not directly interact.

Using p-correlation in this network we found that p-correlation can identify

the existence and direction of the interactions between the driving ROI and

the other two ROIs (even when the two interactions are of diﬀerent strengths).

Furthermore, p-correlation did not introduce false interactions between the two

driven ROIs.

We have applied p-correlation to experimental data from the 1000 Functional

Connectome Project (Biswal et al., 2010). The p-correlation approach success-

fully replicated the modular architecture of the local and distributed networks

previously reported using standard correlation (Xu et al., 2014) (see Section 5

Fig. 8). Highly correlated p-correlation values on the two diﬀerent cohorts also

demonstrated that the p-correlation is highly reproducible and thus robust on

experimental data.

Here we introduce a novel approach, the p-correlation, to estimate brain con-

nectivity within well-characterized large-scale functional networks. The replica-

tion of previously observed network architectures in experimental data and the

performance against the ground truth in simulated data, both suggest that the

p-correlation approach may hold promise for future investigations of the brain’s

dynamic functional architecture.
