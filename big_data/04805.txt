ABSTRACT. This paper considers the geometry of E8 from a Clifford point of view in three com-
plementary ways. Firstly, in earlier work, I had shown how to construct the four-dimensional
exceptional root systems from the 3D root systems using Clifford techniques, by constructing
them in the 4D even subalgebra of the 3D Clifford algebra; for instance the icosahedral root
system H3 gives rise to the largest (and therefore exceptional) non-crystallographic root system
H4. Arnold’s trinities and the McKay correspondence then hint that there might be an indi-
rect connection between the icosahedron and E8. Secondly, in a related construction, I have
now made this connection explicit for the ﬁrst time: in the 8D Clifford algebra of 3D space
the 120 elements of the icosahedral group H3 are doubly covered by 240 8-component objects,
which endowed with a ‘reduced inner product’ are exactly the E8 root system. It was previously
known that E8 splits into H4-invariant subspaces, and we discuss the folding construction re-
lating the two pictures. This folding is a partial version of the one used for the construction of
the Coxeter plane, so thirdly we discuss the geometry of the Coxeter plane in a Clifford algebra
framework. We advocate the complete factorisation of the Coxeter versor in the Clifford algebra
into exponentials of bivectors describing rotations in orthogonal planes with the rotation angle
giving the correct exponents, which gives much more geometric insight than the usual approach
of complexiﬁcation and search for complex eigenvalues. In particular, we explicitly ﬁnd these
factorisations for the 2D, 3D and 4D root systems, D6 as well as E8, whose Coxeter versor fac-
torises as W = exp( π
30 B4). This explicitly describes 30-fold
rotations in 4 orthogonal planes with the correct exponents {1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29} arising
completely algebraically from the factorisation.

1. INTRODUCTION

At the last AGACSE in 2012, I presented a new link between the geometries of three and four
dimensions; in particular, I have shown that any reﬂection group in three dimensions induces
a corresponding symmetry group in four dimensions, via a new Clifford spinor construction
[6, 7]. This connection had been overlooked for centuries (usually one assumes the larger
groups are more fundamental) but the new construction derives all the exceptional phenomena
in 4D – D4, F4 and H4 – via induction from the 3D symmetry groups of the Platonic solids A3,
B3 and H3. This spinor construction also explains the unusual 4D automorphism groups. The
4D groups in fact do not contain anything that is not already present in the 3D groups they are
induced from [4].
This begs the obvious question of whether one can derive the largest exceptional geometry E8,
the holy grail of mathematics and physics, in a Clifford algebra approach as well. I have now
found a construction that constructs the E8 root system (see Fig. 1) in analogy to the above
construction going from 3D to 4D [8]. This previous construction worked along the following
lines: each 3D root system – which generates the corresponding reﬂection symmetry group via
the reﬂections in the hyperplanes orthogonal to the root vectors – allows one to form a group
of spinors by multiplying together even numbers of the reﬂection generating root vectors in
the Clifford algebra; these spinors have four components (the usual 1 scalar and 3 bivector
components) and one can endow these with a 4D Euclidean metric. One can then show that the
resulting set of spinors reinterpreted as 4D vectors satisﬁes the axioms for a 4D root system,
thereby generating a symmetry group in 4D.

THE E8 GEOMETRY FROM A CLIFFORD PERSPECTIVE

FIGURE 1. The projection of the 240 8D root vectors in the E8 root system into
the Coxeter plane is a popular visualisation of E8 as 8 concentric circles of 30.

For instance, starting with the root system H3 which generates the symmetries of the icosa-
hedron, one generates a group 2I of 120 spinors (the binary icosahedral group) via multipli-
cation in the Clifford algebra. These are precisely the 120 root vectors of the 4D root sys-
tem H4 once reinterpreted using the 4D Euclidean metric. H4 is exceptional and the largest
non-crystallographic Coxeter group; it also has the exceptional automorphism group 2I × 2I
[13, 14]. However, this is trivial to see in terms of the spinor group 2I, as it must be trivially
closed under left and right multiplication via group closure.
Taking the full set of pinors (i.e. not restricting to even products of root vectors) of the icosa-
hedron, one generates a group (doubly covering the 120 elements of H3) of 240 pinors with 8
components, as beﬁts a group of multivectors in 3D. I have now been able to show that these 240
pinors are precisely the 240 roots of E8 by using a reduced inner product, thereby generating
the exceptional group E8 [8].
It is extraordinary that the exceptional geometry E8 has been hiding in the shadows of icosahe-
dral geometry for millennia, without anyone noticing. As with the 4D induction construction,
this discovery seems only possible in Clifford algebra. There is much prejudice against the
usefulness of Clifford algebras (since they have matrix representations) and usually matrix
methods are equivalent if less insightful – but the 4D and 8D induction constructions are to
my knowledge the only results that require Clifford algebra and were completely invisible to
standard matrix methods.
This paper is structured in the following way. After some background and basic deﬁnitions in
Section 2, we summarise the general result that any 3D reﬂection group induces a 4D symmetry
group, via their root systems (Section 3). In terms of their 3D spinors, the Platonic root systems
(A3,B3,H3) thus induce all the exceptional 4D root systems (D4,F4,H4) with this spinorial
approach also explaining their unusual symmetry groups. We treat as an illustrative example
the case of the icosahedral group H3 whose spinor group is the binary icosahedral group 2I. It
doubly covers the 60 icosahedral rotations in terms of 120 spinors, but when thought of as a

collection of 4-component objects is precisely H4, the exceptional largest non-crystallographic
root system. Arnold’s trinities contain the above Platonic root systems (A3,B3,H3) as well as
the exceptional Lie groups (E6,E7,E8). They are connected indirectly via various intermediate
trinities as well as more explicitly via the new spinor construction in combination with the
McKay correspondence. This therefore hints that the icosahedron may be indirectly connected
with E8. Section 4 makes this explicit for the ﬁrst time via a new, direct construction [8],
which explicitly constructs the 240 roots E8 from the 240 pinors that doubly cover the 120
elements of the icosahedral group in the Clifford algebra of 3D. Thus all the exceptional root
systems can be seen to be contained in the geometry of 3D via the Platonic symmetries and
the Clifford algebra of 3D. This offers a completely new way of viewing these in terms of
spinorial geometry. Section 5 discusses H4 as a rotational subgroup of E8, and thus affords a
second way of viewing H4 more naturally as a group of rotations rather than reﬂections (as is
the standard view in the Coxeter picture). This construction of H4 from E8 is in fact a partial
folding or 4-fold colouring of the E8 diagram, whilst a complete folding leads to the Coxeter
plane. We therefore ﬁnish by discussing the geometry of the Coxeter plane of various root
systems, notably E8, and point out which advantages a Clifford algebraic view has to offer over
the naive standard view which involves complexifying the real geometry: in Clifford algebra the
complex eigenvalues in fact arise naturally as rotations in mutually orthogonal eigenplanes of
the Coxeter element (Section 6) with the bivectors of the planes providing the relevant complex
structures; we conclude in Section 7 and again stress that for root systems and reﬂection groups
Clifford algebra is the most natural framework.

2. BACKGROUND

Lie groups are a ubiquitous in mathematics and physics. In particular, the largest exceptional
Lie group E8 is of fundamental importance in String Theory and Grand Uniﬁed Theories and
is thus arguably the single most important symmetry group in modern theoretical physics. Lie
groups are continuous (group manifolds) but they are closely related to their corresponding Lie
algebras whose non-trivial part in turn is described by a root system:
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Root system). A root system is a collection Φ of non-zero (root) vectors α
spanning an n-dimensional Euclidean vector space V endowed with a positive deﬁnite bilinear
form, which satisﬁes the two axioms:

(1) Φ only contains a root α and its negative, but no other scalar multiples: Φ∩ Rα =
(2) Φ is invariant under all reﬂections corresponding to root vectors in Φ: sαΦ = Φ ∀ α ∈

{−α,α} ∀ α ∈ Φ.

Φ. The reﬂection sα in the hyperplane with normal α is given by

sα : λ → sα (λ ) = λ − 2 (λ|α)
(α|α)

α,

where (·|·) denotes the inner product on V .

For a crystallographic root system, a subset ∆ of Φ, called simple roots α1, . . . ,αn, is sufﬁcient
to express every element of Φ via Z-linear combinations with coefﬁcients of the same sign.
Φ is therefore completely characterised by this basis of simple roots. In the case of the non-
crystallographic root systems H2, H3 and H4, the same holds for the extended integer ring
Z[τ] = {a + τb|a,b ∈ Z}, where τ is the golden ratio τ = 1
5 , and σ is its
Galois conjugate σ = 1
5) (the two solutions to the quadratic equation x2 = x+1). For the
crystallographic root systems, the classiﬁcation in terms of Dynkin diagrams essentially follows
the one familiar from Lie groups and Lie algebras, as their Weyl groups are the crystallographic
Coxeter groups. A mild generalisation to so-called Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams is necessary for
the non-crystallographic root systems:

THE E8 GEOMETRY FROM A CLIFFORD PERSPECTIVE

Deﬁnition 2.2 (Coxeter-Dynkin diagram and Cartan matrix). A graphical representation of
the geometric content of a root system is given by Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams, where nodes
correspond to simple roots, orthogonal roots are not connected, roots at π
3 have a simple link,
m have a link with a label m. The Cartan matrix of a set of simple roots αi ∈ ∆
and other angles π
is deﬁned as the matrix Ai j = 2(αi|α j)/(α j|α j).

5 ), as does its four-dimensional analogue H4.

For instance, the root system of the icosahedral group H3 has one link labelled by 5 (via the
above relation τ = 2cos π
The reﬂections in the second axiom of the root system generate a reﬂection group. A Coxeter
group is a mathematical abstraction of the concept of a reﬂection group via involutive generators
(i.e.
they square to the identity, which captures the idea of a reﬂection), subject to mixed
relations that represent m-fold rotations (since two successive reﬂections generate a rotation in
the plane deﬁned by the two roots).
Deﬁnition 2.3 (Coxeter group). A Coxeter group is a group generated by a set of involutive
generators si,s j ∈ S subject to relations of the form (sis j)mi j = 1 with mi j = m ji ≥ 2 for i (cid:54)= j.

The ﬁnite Coxeter groups have a geometric representation where the involutions are realised
as reﬂections at hyperplanes through the origin in a Euclidean vector space V , i.e.
they are
essentially just the classical reﬂection groups. In particular, then the abstract generator si corre-
sponds to the simple reﬂection si : λ → si(λ ) = λ − 2 (λ|αi)
(αi|αi)αi in the hyperplane perpendicular
to the simple root αi. The action of the Coxeter group is to permute these root vectors, and its
structure is thus encoded in the collection Φ ∈ V of all such roots, which in turn form a root
system.
It is thus straightforward to move between those four related concepts of Lie groups/algebras,
root systems and Coxeter groups and we will usually not make a distinction – with the exception
of non-crystallographic root systems such as H3 (which generates icosahedral symmetry) and
its 4D analogue H4: their non-crystallographic nature means that there is no associated Lie
algebra, since going to the Lie algebra level in the Kac-Moody approach the Cartan matrix
entries appear in the Chevalley-Serre relations as powers of the generators, which have to be
integers rather than Z[τ] integers.
The E8 root system is thus usually thought of as an exceptional (i.e. there are no corresponding
symmetry groups in arbitrary dimensions) phenomenon of eight-dimensional geometry, with no
connection to the 3D geometry we inhabit. Surprisingly, the eight dimensions of 3D Clifford
algebra actually allow E8 to ﬁt into our 3D geometry; likewise all 4D exceptional root systems
arise within 3D geometry from the Platonic symmetries, unveiling them all as intrinsically 3D
phenomena. This opens up a revolutionary way of viewing exceptional higher-dimensional
geometries in terms of 3D spinorial geometry.
We employ a Clifford algebra framework, which via the geometric product by xy = x · y +
x∧ y affords a uniquely simple prescription for performing reﬂections λ → si(λ ) = λ − 2(α ·
λ )α = −αλα (assuming unit normalisation). This yields a double cover of the reﬂections
(since α and −α give the same reﬂection) and thus via the Cartan-Diedonn´e theorem (which
allows one to express any orthogonal transformation as the product of reﬂections) one gets a
double cover of all orthogonal transformations A : v → v(cid:48) = A(v) = ± ˜AvA, in spaces of any
dimension and signature, by products of unit vectors A = α1α2 . . .αk called versors. We also
call even versors spinors, as they doubly cover the special orthogonal transformations, and
general versors pinors, as they doubly cover the orthogonal transformations.
The non-exceptional Lie groups have been realised as spin groups in Geometric Algebra [11],
and Lie algebras as bivector algebras; here we offer a Clifford geometric construction of all the
exceptional phenomena via their root systems. Of course, H4 does not even have an associated
Lie algebra and Lie group and therefore could not be constructed as a spin group or bivector

algebra. We therefore advocate the root system as the most convenient, insightful and funda-
mental concept: for a root system, the quadratic form mentioned in the deﬁnition can always be
used to enlarge the n-dimensional vector space V to the corresponding 2n-dimensional Clifford
algebra. The Clifford algebra is therefore a very natural object to consider in this context, as its
uniﬁed structure simpliﬁes many problems both conceptually and computationally, rather than
applying the linear structure of the space and the inner product separately. In particular, it pro-
vides the above (s)pinor double covers of the (special) orthogonal transformations, as well as
geometric quantities that serve as unit imaginaries. We will see the beneﬁts of those throughout
the paper. We will largely be working with the Clifford algebra of 3D generated by three or-
thogonal unit vectors e1, e2 and e3, which is itself an eight-dimensional vector space consisting

3. THE GENERAL SPINOR INDUCTION CONSTRUCTION: H4 AS A GROUP OF ROTATIONS

RATHER THAN REFLECTIONS I, TRINITIES AND MCKAY CORRESPONDENCE

In this section we prove that any 3D root system yields a 4D root system via the spinor group
obtained by multiplying together root vectors in the Clifford algebra [7].
Proposition 3.1 (O(4)-structure of spinors). The space of Cl(3)-spinors R = a0 + a1e2e3 +

This allows one to reinterpret the group of 3D spinors generated from a 3D root system as a
set of 4D vectors, which in fact can be shown to satisfy the axioms of a root system as given in
Deﬁnition 2.1.
Theorem 3.2 (Induction Theorem). Any 3D root system gives rise to a spinor group G which
induces a root system in 4D.

Proof. Check the two axioms for the root system Φ consisting of the set of 4D vectors given by
the 3D spinor group:

(1) By construction, Φ contains the negative of a root R since spinors provide a double
cover of rotations, i.e. if R is in a spinor group G, then so is −R , but no other scalar
multiples (normalisation to unity).

Since the irreducible 3D root systems are (A3,B3,H3), the induction construction also yields
three induced root systems in 4D. These are in fact the exceptional root systems in 4D (D4,F4,H4).
Both sets of three are in fact amongst Arnold’s trinities following his observation that (R,C,H)
[1, 2] form a basic unit of three which can be extended to analogous sets of three such as the
corresponding projective spaces, Lie algebras of E-type (E6,E7,E8), spheres, Hopf ﬁbrations
etc. This is the ﬁrst very tentative hint that the icosahedral group H3 might be related to the ex-
ceptional geometry E8. Arnolds original link between (A3,B3,H3) and (D4,F4,H4) is similarly
extremely convoluted/indirect, whilst our construction presents a novel direct link between the
two; we will ﬁrst make the H3 and E8 connection more suggestive below, before making it ex-
plicit for the ﬁrst time. These root systems are intimately linked to the Platonic solids [5]. There
are 5 in three dimensions and 6 in four dimensions: A3 describes the reﬂection symmetries of

6

THE E8 GEOMETRY FROM A CLIFFORD PERSPECTIVE

1 generates A4

the tetrahedron, B3 those of the cube and octahedron (which are dual under the exchange of
midpoints of faces and vertices), and H3 describes the symmetries of the dual pair icosahedron
and dodecahedron (the rotational subgroup is denoted by I = A5), whilst the 4D Coxeter groups
describe the symmetries of the 4D Platonic solids. But this time the connection is much more
immediate: the Platonic solids are actually root systems themselves (or duals thereof). D4 is the
24-cell (self-dual), an analogue of the tetrahedron, which is also related to the F4 root system.
The H4 root system is the Platonic solid the 600-cell with its dual, the 120-cell (also Platonic),
having the same symmetry. A3
1, which constitutes the 16-cell – its dual is the
8-cell, both are Platonic solids. There is thus an abundance of root systems in 4D giving the
Platonic solids, which is essentially due to the accidentalness of the spinor induction theorem,
compared to arbitrary dimensions where the only root systems and Platonic solids are An (n-
simplex), Bn (n-hypercube and n-hyperoctahedron) and Dn. In fact the only 4D Platonic solid
that is not equal or dual to a root system is the 5-cell with symmetry group A4, which of course
could not be a root system, as its odd number (5) of vertices violates the ﬁrst root system axiom.
The induced root systems (D4,F4,H4) are precisely the exceptional ones in 4D, where we count
D4 as exceptional because of its exceptional triality symmetry (permutation symmetry of the
three legs in the diagram accidental in 4D). It is of great importance in string theory, showing
the equivalence of the Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz and the Green-Schwarz strings. F4 is the only
F-type root system, and H4 is the largest non-crystallographic root system. They therefore
naturally form a trinity.
On top of the exceptional nature of these root systems (their existence), they also have very
unusual automorphism groups. This is readily shown via the above spinor construction:
Theorem 3.3 (Spinorial symmetries). A root system induced through the Clifford spinor con-
struction via a binary polyhedral spinor group G has an automorphism group that trivially
contains two factors of the respective spinor group G acting from the left and from the right.

This systematises many case-by-case observations on the structure of the automorphism groups
[13, 14] (for instance, the automorphism group of the H4 root system is 2I × 2I – in the spinor
picture, it is not surprising that 2I yields both the root system and the two factors in the auto-
morphism group), and shows that all of the 4D geometry is already contained in 3D [4] in the
following sense. In terms of quaternionic representations of a 4D root system (e.g. H4), the
3D root system (H3) is often remarked in the literature to consist precisely of the pure quater-
nions, i.e. those without a real part, and the full 4D group can be generated from these under
quaternion multiplication. This is very poorly understood in the literature: in our picture the
spinors are just isomorphic to the quaternions whilst when the inversion ±I is contained in the
full group, one can trivially Hodge dualise vectors to bivectors (pure quaternions). However,
this statement is not true when the inversion is not contained in the group (e.g. for A3). Con-
versely, the spinorial induction construction still works perfectly well yielding D4. I.e. the fact
that the 3D group is generated by the subset of the pure quaternions amongst the 4D group
under quaternion multiplication is just a corollary of spinor induction when the inversion is
contained in the group. The literature has it ‘backwards’ deriving the 3D root system from
the 4D root system (under inconsistent conditions), whilst in our picture the 3D root systems
are more fundamental as they allow us to construct the 4D root system without any further
information. Moreover, the ‘quaternionic generators’ generating the 4D groups via quaternion
multiplication cited in the literature are easily seen to just be the products of pairs of 3D simple
roots (spinors) α1α2 and α2α3. Thus the 4D group clearly does not contain anything that was
not already contained in the 3D group, and we therefore argue that 3D root systems and spinor
induction are fundamental rather than the 4D root systems.

We consider the examples of the inductions of A3
the former, the 6 roots can be chosen as ±e1,±e2,±e3. Pairwise products yield the 8 spinors
±1,±e1e2,±e2e3,±e3e1. 3D spinors have four components (1, e1e2, e2e3, e3e1), such that

these 8 spinors give the 8 vertices of the (4D root system and Platonic solid) 16-cell

(±1,0,0,0) (8 permutations).

We now also construct the spinor group generated by the simple roots of H3, which we take as

α1 = e2,α2 = −1
2

((τ − 1)e1 + e2 + τe3), and α3 = e3.

Under multiplication with the geometric product they generate a group of 240 pinors doubly
covering the 120 elements of H3. Its even subgroup consists of 120 spinors doubly covering
the rotational subgroup A5, e.g. α1α2 = − 1
2 (τ − (τ −
1)e3e1 + e2e3). Taking the components of these 120 spinors in 4D yields exactly the H4 root

This is very surprising from a Coxeter perspective, as one usually thinks of H3 as a subgroup
of H4, and therefore of H4 as more fundamental. However, we have seen that H4 does not
actually contain anything that is not already in H3, which makes H3 more fundamental [4].
From a Clifford perspective it is not at all surprising to ﬁnd this group of 120 spinors (the
binary icosahedral group 2I) since it is well-known that Clifford algebra provides a simple
construction of the Spin groups. However, this is extremely surprising from the conventional
Coxeter and Lie group point of view.
It is convenient to have all the four different types of polyhedral groups (chiral, full, binary,
pin) in a uniﬁed framework within the Clifford algebra, rather than using SO(3) matrices for
the rotations and then having to use SU(2) matrices for the binary groups, as one can perform
all the different group operations with multivectors in the same Clifford algebra. For instance,
the spinor group 2I consists of 120 elements and 9 conjugacy classes, as one can easily conﬁrm
by explicit computation. A5 has ﬁve conjugacy classes and is of order 60, which implies that it
has ﬁve irreducible representations of dimensions 1, 3, ¯3, 4 and 5. The nine conjugacy classes of
the binary icosahedral group 2I of order 120 therefore mean that it has a further four irreducible
spinorial representations 2s, 2(cid:48)
s, 4s and 6s. This binary icosahedral group has a mysterious two-
fold connection with the afﬁne Lie algebra E+
8 via the so-called McKay correspondence [15],
which in fact applies to all other binary polyhedral groups and the afﬁne Lie algebras of ADE-
type (c.f. Figure 3): ﬁrstly, we can deﬁne a graph by assigning a node to each of the nine
irreducible representation of the binary icosahedral group where we connect nodes according
to its tensor product structure: each irreducible representation is represented by a node and
it is only connected to other nodes corresponding to those irreducible representations that are
contained in its tensor product with the irreducible representation 2s. For instance, tensoring
the trivial representation 1 with 2s trivially gives 1⊗ 2s = 2s and thus 1 is only connected to 2s;
2s⊗ 2s = 1 + 3, such that 2s is connected to 1 (as we know) and also to 3, and so on. The graph
that is built up in this way is precisely the Dynkin diagram of afﬁne E8 (Figure 2). Secondly the
order of the Coxeter element (the product of all the simple reﬂections α1 . . .α8), the Coxeter
number h, is 30 for E8, which is also exactly the sum of the dimensions of the irreducible
representations of 2I, ∑di. As already stated, these both extend to a correspondence between
all binary polyhedral groups and the ADE-type afﬁne Lie algebras.
We can therefore extend the connection between (A3,B3,H3) and (2T,2O,2I) via the McKay
correspondence which links (2T,2O,2I) and (E6,E7,E8) to a new connection between (A3,B3,H3)
and (E6,E7,E8) via Clifford spinors, which does not seem to be known. In particular, (12,18,30)
is one of the two connections in the McKay correspondence denoting the Coxeter number of
the afﬁne Lie algebra as well as the sum of the dimensions of the irreducible representations

the number of roots in the 3D root systems (12,18,30). These then induce the
binary polyhedral groups (linked via the McKay correspondence to the E-type
afﬁne Lie algebras) and the 4D root systems via the Clifford spinor construc-
tion. The new pinor construction links H3 directly with E8 explaining the latter

roots Φ in the 3D root systems (A3,B3,H3), which therefore feeds all the way through to the
binary polyhedral groups and via the McKay correspondence to the afﬁne Lie algebras. Our
construction therefore makes deep connections between trinities, and puts the McKay corre-
spondence into a wider framework, as shown in Figure 3. It is worth noting that the afﬁne Lie

8 only have S1, but are intimately
related as explained in Section 5. This therefore again suggests that there is a link between the
icosahedron and E8, which is slightly more explicit than just from observing the trinities. In the
next section we will show a new, completely explicit direct connection within the Clifford alge-
bra of 3D by identifying the 240 roots of E8 with the 240 pinors doubly covering the elements
of the icosahedral group H4 (right of Figure 3) [8].

4. THE BIRTH OF E8 OUT OF THE SPINORS OF THE ICOSAHEDRON

roots of H4

(±1,0,0,0) (8 permutations)

2 (0,−σ ,−τ,1),
A set of simple roots for these is given e.g. by a1 = 1
a3 = 1
As we have discussed above the H3 root system contains the inversion ±e1e2e3 = ±I. It simply
Hodge dualises the 120 spinors doubly covering the even subgroup A5 of 60 rotations to create
a second copy consisting of vector and pseudoscalar parts. This gives the 120 additional group
elements necessary to provide the 240 pinor double covering of the group H3 = A5×Z2 of order
120. These therefore consist of a copy of the 120 spinors (essentially H4) and another copy
multiplied by I. These are now valued in the full 8D Clifford algebra of 3D space consisting of
scalar, vector, bivector and trivector parts. For this set of 240 pinors in the 8D Clifford algebra
of 3D we now deﬁne a ‘reduced inner product’: we keep the spinor copy of H4 and multiply
the copy IH4 by τI. We then take inner products taking into account the recursion relation
τ2 = τ + 1 but then rather than taking the usual inner product consisting of both the integer
with the Z[τ]-integer part (·,·) = a +τb we extract only the integer part by deﬁning the reduced
inner product [18, 16]

(·,·)τ = (a + τb)τ := a.

which is just the E8 Cartan matrix [8]. The 240 icosahedral pinors therefore give the 240 roots
of E8 under the reduced inner product and it is straightforward (if tedious) to check closure
under reﬂections with respect to the reduced inner product.
Surprisingly, the E8 root system has therefore been hidden in plain sight within the geometry of
the Platonic icosahedron for three millennia, without anyone noticing. As with the 4D induction
construction, this discovery seems only possible in Clifford algebra – there is much prejudice
against the usefulness of Clifford algebras since they have matrix representations and usually
matrix methods are equivalent if less insightful – but the 4D and 8D induction constructions
are to my knowledge the only results that required Clifford algebra and were hitherto invisible
to standard matrix methods.

5. H4 AS A GROUP OF ROTATIONS RATHER THAN REFLECTIONS II: FROM E8

The usual view is the reverse of the process shown in the previous section, inducing E8 from H3,
via two intermediate copies of H4. E8 has an H4 subgroup, as can be shown via Coxeter-Dynkin
diagram foldings [17]:
We consider now the Clifford algebra in 8D with the usual Euclidean metric and take the simple
roots α1 to α8 of E8 as shown in Fig. 4. The simple reﬂections corresponding to the simple
roots are thus just given via sαv = −αvα. The Coxeter element w is deﬁned as the product
of all these eight simple reﬂections, and in Clifford algebra it is therefore simply given by the
corresponding Coxeter versor W = α1 . . .α8 acting via sandwiching as wλ = ˜WλW . Its order,
the Coxeter number h (i.e. W h = ±1), is 30 for E8 as mentioned previously.
As illustrated in Figure 4, one can now deﬁne certain combinations of pairs of reﬂections (ac-
cording to a four-fold colouring of the diagram, or corresponding to roots on top of each other
in a Dynkin diagram folding), e.g. sa1 = sα1sα7 etc. In a Clifford algebra setup these are just
given by the products of root vectors a1 = α1α7, a2 = α2α6, a3 = α3α5 and a4 = α4α8 (this is
essentially a partial folding of the usual alternating folding/two-colouring used in the construc-
tion of the Coxeter plane with symmetry group I2(h), see the next section). It is easy to show
that the subgroup with the generators sai in fact satisﬁes the relations of the H4 Coxeter group
[3, 17]: because of the Coxeter relations for E8 and the orthogonality of the combined pair the
combinations sa are easily seen to be involutions, and the 3-fold relations are similarly obvious
from the Coxeter relations; only for the 5-fold relation does one have to perform an explicit
calculation in terms of the reﬂections with respect to the root vectors. This is thus particularly
easy by multiplying together vectors in the Clifford algebra, rather than by concatenating two
reﬂection formulas of the type shown in Deﬁnition 2.1 – despite it only consisting of two terms,
concatenation gets convoluted quickly, unlike multiplying together multivectors.
Since the combinations sa are pairs of reﬂections, they are obviously rotations in the eight-
dimensional space, so this H4 group acts as rotations in the full space, but as a reﬂection group in
a 4D subspace. The H4 Coxeter element is given by multiplying together the four combinations
ai – its Coxeter versor is therefore trivially seen to be the same as that of E8 (up to sign, since
orthogonal vectors anticommute) and the Coxeter number of H4 is thus the same as that of E8,
30. The projection of the E8 root system onto the Coxeter plane consists of two copies of the
projection of H4 into the Coxeter plane, with a relative factor of τ (see the next section and in
particular Figure 9). This is also related to the fact that on the level of the root system there
is a projection which maps the 240 roots of E8 onto the 120 roots of H4 and their τ-multiples
in one of the H4-invariant 4-subspaces [16, 10] (c.f. previous section). This is essentially the
exact reverse of ﬁnding E8 from the two copies H4 + τH4 in the last section. We therefore now
consider the Coxeter plane itself.

6. THE COXETER PLANE

In this section, we consider the geometry of the Coxeter plane e.g. achieved by a complete
folding/two-fold colouring of the E8 Dynkin diagram (Figure 5). For a given Coxeter element
w of any root system, there is a unique plane called the Coxeter plane on which w acts as a
rotation by 2π/h. Projection of a root system onto the Coxeter plane is thus a way of visualising
any ﬁnite Coxeter group, for instance the well-known representation of E8 is such a projection
of the 240 vertices of the root system onto the Coxeter plane. In the standard theory there is an
unnecessary complexiﬁcation of the real geometry followed by taking real sections again just
so that complex eigenvalues exp(2πim/h) of w, for some integers m called exponents, can be
found [12]. Unsurprisingly, in Clifford algebra these complex structures arise naturally, and the
complex ‘eigenvectors’ are in fact eigenplanes where the Coxeter element acts as a rotation.
We therefore systematically factorise Coxeter versors of root systems in the Clifford algebra,

FIGURE 5. Illustration of the geometry of the Coxeter plane via diagram fold-
ings. Since any ﬁnite Coxeter group has a tree-like diagram, one can partition the
simple roots into two sets (black and white) of roots that are orthogonal within
each set. Since the Cartan matrix is positive deﬁnite, it has a Perron-Frobenius
eigenvector with all positive entries. This allows one to show the existence of
the invariant Coxeter plane (by construction) as the bivector deﬁned by the outer
product of two vectors that are linear combinations of all the reciprocals of the
white (respectively black) simple roots with the corresponding coefﬁcients given
by the entries in the Perron-Frobenius eigenvector.

which gives the eigenplanes and exponents algebraically. We brieﬂy discuss the 2D case of the
two-dimensional family of non-crystallographic Coxeter groups I2(n), followed by the three-
dimensional groups A3, B3 and H3 [6], before discussing the higher-dimensional examples.
The simple roots for I2(n) can be taken as α1 = e1, α2 = −cos π
n e2, which yields
the Coxeter versor W describing the n-fold rotation encoded by the I2(n) Coxeter element via
v → wv = ˜W vW as
(1)

e1e2 = −exp (−πe1e2/n).

W = α1α2 = −cos

In Clifford algebra it is therefore immediately obvious that the action of the I2(n) Coxeter
element is described by a versor that encodes rotations in the e1e2-Coxeter-plane and yields
h = n since trivially W n = (−1)n+1. Since I = e1e2 is the bivector deﬁning the plane of e1 and
e2, it anticommutes with both e1 and e2 such that one can take W through to the left (which
reverses the bivector part) to arrive at the complex eigenvector equation

v → wv = ˜W vW = ˜W 2v = exp (±2πI/n)v.

This yields the standard result for the complex eigenvalues, however, in Clifford algebra it is
now obvious that the complex structure is in fact given by the bivector describing the Coxeter
plane (which is trivial for I2(n)), and that the standard complexiﬁcation is both unmotivated
and unnecessary.
More generally, if v lies in a plane in which W acts as a rotation, then

v → wv = ˜W vW = ˜W 2v

still holds, whereas if v is orthogonal such that the bivector describing the planes commutes
with v, one just has

v → wv = ˜W vW = ˜WW v = v.

Thus, if W factorises into orthogonal eigenspaces W = W1 . . .Wk with v lying in the plane de-
ﬁned by W1, then all the orthogonal Wis commute through and cancel out, whilst the one that
deﬁnes the eigenplane that v lies in described by the bivector Bi gives the standard complex
eigenvalue equation

v → wv = ˜W vW = ˜W1 . . . ˜WkvW1 . . .Wk = ˜W1

If m is an exponent then so is h−m since w−1 will act as W1
m)/h)v; in particular 1 and h− 1 are always exponents (from the Coxeter plane) – in Clifford
algebra it is easy to see that these are just righthanded and lefthanded rotations in the respective

2v = exp(−2πBim/h)v = exp(2πBi(h−

. . . ˜WkWkv = ˜W1

2v = exp(2πBim/h)v.

eigenplanes, with bivectors giving the complex structures. If W has pure vector factors then
these act as reﬂections and trivially yield the exponents h/2.
The pin group/eigenblade description in Geometric Algebra therefore yields a wealth of novel
geometric insight, and we now consider higher-dimensional examples. For 3D and 4D groups,
the geometry is completely governed by the above 2D geometry in the Coxeter plane, since
the remaining normal vector (3D) or bivector (4D) are trivially ﬁxed. For H3 one has h = 10
and complex eigenvalues exp(2πmi/h) with the exponents m = {1,5,9}. For simple roots
α1 = e2, −2α2 = (τ − 1)e1 + e2 + τe3 and α3 = e3, the Coxeter plane bivector is BC = e1e2 +
τe3e1 and the Coxeter versor 2W = −τe2 − e3 + (τ − 1)I (here I = e1e2e3) with eigenvalues
exp (±2πBC/h), which corresponds to m = 1 and m = 9. The vector bC = BCI = −τe2 − e3
orthogonal to the Coxeter plane can only get reversed (since the Coxeter element in 3D is an
odd operation), so one has − ˜W bCW = −bC = exp (±5· 2πBC/h)bC which gives m = 5. A3
and B3 are very similar, they have Coxeter numbers h = 4 and h = 6, respectively, and thus
exponents m = {1,2,3} and m = {1,3,5}. The exponents 1 and h− 1 correspond to a rotation
in the Coxeter plane in which the Coxeter element acts by h-fold rotation, whilst the normal to
the Coxeter plane gets simply reﬂected, corresponding to the cases h/2 (m = 2 and m = 3 for
A3 and B3, respectively).
We now consider the four-dimensional cases A4, B4, D4, F4 and H4. We explain the case
of A4 in detail, which is known to have exponents {1,2,3,4}. We take as the simple roots
2(τe1 +τe2 +τe3 +(τ −2)e4).
α1 = 1√
2
It is easy to calculate that this choice of simple roots yields the correct A4 Cartan matrix and
that reﬂections in them yield a root polytope of 20 vertices. This matrix has Perron-Frobenius
eigenvector (1,τ,τ,1)T and one can construct the Coxeter plane bivector as BC ∝ −e1e3 −
e1e4 + e2e3 + e2e4 − 1/2(τ − 1)e3e4 via the two vectors e3 + e4 and −e1 + e2 + e3 + (2τ + 1)e4
arrived at from the Perron-Frobenius eigenvector and the reciprocal frame of the simple roots as
illustrated in Figure 5. The Coxeter versor W = α3α1α2α4 is calculated to be 4W = 1− e2e3 +
e1e4 + (τ − 1)(e3e4 + e2e4 − e1e3) − (τ + 1)e1e2 − (2τ − 1)e1e2e3e4. It is easy to show that

˜W BCW = BC and the Coxeter element therefore indeed stabilises the Coxeter plane. However,
we are claiming that the Coxeter element can actually be written as bivector exponentials in the
planes deﬁned by BC and IBC, with angles given by the exponents {1,2,3,4}. These are given
as left- and righthanded rotations in the two planes as shown in Figure 6 a) and b). The Coxeter
projection of the 20 vertices forms two concentric decagonal circles – in the Coxeter plane
w acts as a rotation by 2π/5 (as denoted by the two coloured vertices in a) with the Coxeter
element taking one into the other), whilst in the plane IBC it acts as a rotation by 4π/5, as
shown in b). It is easy to check that W can indeed be written as W = exp( π
5 IBC).
It is clear that taking the product of simple roots in the Coxeter element in a different order
introduces overall minus signs as well as minus signs in the exponentials, so we will not worry
about these from now on.
A4 is unusual in that the projection from 4D only yields two concentric circles in the Coxeter
plane. In fact, it consists of two copies of H2 (panel c)) with a relative factor of τ. This is similar
to the situation for E8 and H4, as explained in Fig. 4, since by removing four of the eight nodes
one gets a diagram folding from A4 to H2. In [9], we were considering afﬁne extensions of
H2 by adding a translation operator and taking the orbit under the compact group (panel d)).
What is striking is that this Ha f f
point set, i.e. an afﬁne extension of the decagon after one unit
translation, is very nearly the Coxeter projection of D6, which is shown in panel e).
The situation for the other 4D groups is similar, as shown in Figure 7, which shows for the
groups B4, D4, F4 and H4 that the Coxeter element acts in the Coxeter plane BC as rotations
by ±2π/h, and in the plane deﬁned by IBC as h-fold rotations giving the other exponents
algebraically. For B4 one has exponents {1,3,5,7} as shown in panels a) and b) and the de-
composition into eigenblades of the Coxeter element W = exp( π
8 IBC) reﬂects this.
D4 has exponents {1,3,3,5} which is reﬂected in the fact that the Coxeter versor can be writ-
ten as W = exp(−π
6 BC)IBC. The Coxeter projections of D4 into
the IBC plane demonstrate that the other factor in W that does not come from BC is actu-
ally the product of two vectors (e1 + e2 − 2e3 and e1 − e2 for simple roots e1, e2, e3 and
2 (e4 − e1 − e2 − e3)) rather than a bivector exponential (since the angle is π/2): on some
1
vectors it acts as a rotation by 3 = h/2 in the plane, others it projects onto the origin (Fig. 7
panels c) and d)). F4 has exponents {1,5,7,11} which again is evident from the Clifford fac-
torisation W = exp( π
12 IBC) and the way it acts on the two planes (panels e) and f)).
H4 has exponents {1,11,19,29} and factorisation W = exp( π
30 IBC) (panels g) and
h)). Table 1 summarises the factorisations of the 4D Coxeter versors.
10BC)exp( 3π
The Coxeter versor of D6 can be written as W = exp( π
10 B2)B3 for certain bivectors
B2 and B3 from which it is evident that the exponents are indeed {1,3,5,5,7,9}, including two
reﬂections and otherwise 10-fold rotations in the Coxeter plane and another orthogonal plane
(Figure Fig. 8 a) and c)). Since as in Fig. 4 by removing a pair of nodes and as for A4&H2 there
is also a diagram folding from D6 to H3 (H3 as we saw above has exponents {1,5,9}), the D6
projection again actually consists of two copies of that of H3 with a relative factor of τ (panel
b)) – but the H3 projection already has radii with a relative factor of τ such that two orbits of
the D6 projection fall on top of each other.

This gives the well-known exponents {1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29} a more geometric meaning as
30-fold rotations in four orthogonal eigenplanes (Fig. 9). As we have alluded to in Section 5,
the Coxeter projection of E8 actually consists of two copies of that of H4 in the bottom row of
Figure 7 with a relative radius of τ. We recall that H4 also has exponents {1,11,19,29} and
since it is a subgroup of E8 they have of course the same Coxeter element and number, and
share two eigenplanes with exponents 1 and 29 as well as 11 and 19.
For this E8 example we explicitly give the details. We choose the simple roots of E8 (in the
Clifford algebra of 8D, rather than as earlier the 8D Clifford algebra of 3D) as

In Clifford algebra, the Coxeter versor as the product of the simple roots therefore completely
encodes the factorisation into orthogonal eigenplanes, as of course it must, as Geometric Al-
gebra and the root system completely determine the geometry, without the need for artiﬁcial
complexiﬁcation.

7. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that with the help of Clifford algebra all exceptional root systems can in fact be
constructed from the 3D root systems alone. This offers a revolutionarily new way of viewing
these phenomena in terms of spinorial geometry of 3D as intrinsically 3D phenomena, with
huge potential implications for the many areas in which these symmetries appear. Likewise, the
geometry of the Coxeter plane is best viewed in a Clifford algebra framework, which provides
geometric meaning and insight, for instance the complex eigenvalues in standard theory are
just seen to be rotations in eigenplanes of the Coxeter element given by bivectors which act as
unit imaginaries. Since the deﬁnition of root systems stipulates a vector space with an inner
product, the associated Clifford algebra of this space can easily be constructed without any
loss of generality and is actually the most natural framework to use for such root systems and
Coxeter groups, both since Clifford algebra affords a uniquely simple reﬂection formula and
since combining the linear structure of the space with the inner product is better than using both
separately.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to thank David Hestenes and his wife Nancy for their support over the years and
for inviting me to spend half a year with them at ASU; my PhD advisor Anthony Lasenby
and his wife Joan Lasenby for all their support over more than a decade; Eckhard Hitzer for his
constant support and encouragement, and likewise Sebasti`a Xamb´o, in particular for organising
a splendid conference and for suggesting (with David Hestenes) a revised and more detailed
writeup for the proceedings.
