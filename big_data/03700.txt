AN INTEGRAL APPROACH TO THE GARDNER-FISHER AND

UNTWISTED DOWKER SUMS

CARLOS M. DA FONSECA, M. LAWRENCE GLASSER, AND VICTOR KOWALENKO

Abstract. We present a new and elegant integral approach to computing the Gardner-
Fisher trigonometric power sum, which is given by

Sm,v = (cid:16) π

2m(cid:17)2v

m−1

Xk=1

cos−2v(cid:18) kπ

2m(cid:19) ,

where m and v are positive integers. This method not only conﬁrms the results obtained
earlier by an empirical method, but it is also much more expedient from a computational
point of view. By comparing the formulas from both methods, we derive several new
interesting number theoretic results involving symmetric polynomials over the set of
quadratic powers up to (v − 1)2 and the generalized cosecant numbers. The method
is then extended to other related trigonometric power sums including the untwisted
Dowker sum. By comparing both forms for this important sum, we derive new formulas
for speciﬁc values of the N¨orlund polynomials. Finally, by using the results appearing in
the tables, we consider more advanced sums involving the product of powers of cotangent
and tangent with powers of cosecant and secant respectively.

In 1969 Gardner [9] stated that the ﬁnite sum of inverse powers of cosines

where m and v are positive integers, emerges during the calculation of the vth cumulant
of a certain quadratic form in m independent standardized normal variates. Although he
was able to show that

lim
m→∞

Sm,v = ζ(2v) ,

where ζ is the Riemann zeta function, he posed the problem of whether it was possible
to obtain a “simpler” closed form expression for Sm,v, for all m and v.

In solving this problem, Fisher [6,16] observed that the above sum could also be written

as

metric power series given by

Qm,v(δ) =

Consequently, he found that

while for large m, he obtained

Sm,v = ζ(2v) +

v

12m2 ζ(2v − 2) + O(cid:0)m−4(cid:1) .

Although Gardner ﬁrst obtained Sm,v, Fisher’s solution is largely responsible for the con-
tinuing interest in the sum. Consequently, the sum will be henceforth referred to as the
Gardner-Fisher sum.

2. Generalized cosecant numbers

In a recent work one of us [18] showed that the Gardner-Fisher sum can be expressed

as

Sm,v =

∞

Xj=0

c2v,j (cid:16) π

2m(cid:17)2j

m−1

Xk=1

k2j−2v ,

where the coeﬃcients cρ,k are a generalization of the cosecant numbers ck in Ref. [19] and
are given by

(2.1)

cρ,k = (−1)k

k,⌊k/2⌋,⌊k/3⌋,...,1

(−1)N (ρ)N

Pk

i=1 i ni=k

.

The above formula has been derived by applying the partition method for a power series
expansion to xρ/ sinρ x. That is, the generalized cosecant numbers are the coeﬃcients of
the power series for this function. The partition method for a power series expansion was
ﬁrst introduced in Ref. [22], but more recently it has been developed further in Refs. [19]-
[21] and [17]. To calculate the generalized cosecant number cρ,k via (2.1), we need to
determine the speciﬁc contribution made by each integer partition that sums to k. For
example, if we wish to determine cρ,5 we require all the contributions made by the seven
partitions that sum to 5 or those listed in the ﬁrst column of Table 2.1. Depending on the
function that is being studied, each element or part in a partition is assigned a speciﬁc
value. In the case of xρ/ sinρ x, each element i is assigned a value of (−1)i+1/(2i + 1)!.
Moreover, if an element occurs ni times in a partition or possesses a multiplicity of ni, then
we need to take ni values or (−1)(i+1)ni/((2i + 1)!)ni. Table 2.1 displays the multiplicities
of all elements in the partitions that sum to 5.

Associated with each partition is a multinomial factor that is determined by taking the

factorial of the total number of elements in the partition N(= Pi ni) and dividing by

the factorials of all the multiplicities. For the partition {2, 1, 1, 1} in Table 2.1, we have
n1 = 3 and n2 = 1, while all other multiplicities do not contibute or vanish. Hence, the
multinomial factor for this partition is 4!/(3! 1!) = 4. When the function is accompanied
by a power, another modiﬁcation must be made. Each partition must be multiplied by
Pochhammer factor of Γ(N + ρ)/Γ(ρ)N! or (ρ)N /N!. For ρ = 1, this simply yields unity

and thus, the multinomial factor is unaﬀected. Then the generalized cosecant numbers
reduce to the cosecant numbers ck [19], which are deﬁned as

and B2k represent the Bernoulli numbers.

In (2.1) the product is concerned with the evaluating the contribution made by each
partition based on the values of the multiplicities, while the sum is concerned with all
partitions. Thus, the sum covers the range of values for the multiplicities. For example,
n1 attains a maximum value of k, which corresponds the partition with k ones, while n2
attains a maximum value of [k/2], which corresponds to the partition with [k/2] twos in
it. Here, [k/n] denotes the ﬂoor function or the largest integer less than or equal to k/n.
Therefore for odd values, the partition with [k/2] twos would also have n1 = 1. Hence,
we see that ni can only attain a maximum value of [k/i], which becomes the upper limit
for each multiplicity in (2.1). Furthermore, a valid partition must satisfy the constraint

given by Pk

i=1 ini = k.

As an example, let us consider the evaluation of cρ,5. According to Table 2.1 there
are seven partitions whose contributions must be evaluated. By following the steps given
above, we ﬁnd that in the order in which the partitions appear in Table 2.1, (2.1) yields

cρ,5 = (ρ)1

From the above result we see that cρ,5 is a ﬁfth order polynomial in ρ. In fact, the highest
order term comes from the partition with k ones in it, which produces the term with
(ρ)k. Hence, we observe that the generalized cosecant numbers are polynomials of order
k. Another interesting property is that all the contributions from partitions with the same
number of elements in them possess the same sign, which toggles according to whether
there is an even or odd number of elements in the partitions. Furthermore, (2.2) can be
simpliﬁed further, whereupon one arrives at the result appearing in the sixth row below
the headings in Table 2.2.

Table 2.2 displays the ﬁrst ﬁfteen generalized cosecant numbers obtained by determin-
ing the multiplicities of all the partitions that sum to each order k and then evaluating the
sum of their contributions according to steps given above. Beyond k = 10, the partition
method for a power series expansion becomes laborious due to the exponential increase in
the number of partitions. To circumvent this problem, a general computing methodology
is required to determine higher order coeﬃcients via the partition method. This method-
ology, which is based on representing all the partitions that sum to a speciﬁc order as
a tree diagram and invoking the bivariate recursive central partition (BRCP) algorithm,

Table 2.2. Generalised cosecant numbers cρ,k up to k = 15

is presented in Ref. [17]. The general expressions for the coeﬃcients can then imported
into a mathematical software package such as Mathematica [29] whereupon its symbolic
routines yield the ﬁnal values presented in Table 2.2.

For the special case, where ρ is an even integer (the case of interest here), the generalized

cosecant numbers satisfy the following recurrence relation:

(2.3)

c2n+2,k+1 =

(2k + 2 − 2n)

(2k + 1 − 2n)

2n

(2n + 1)

c2n,k+1 +

2n + 1

c2n,k .

This equation is obtained by introducing the power series expansion for x2n/ sin2n x into
(27) of Ref. [18], which is

2n(2n + 1) cos2 x

Then one equates like powers of x. For the special case of n = 1, the numbers are related
to the cosecant-squared numbers in Ref. [19]. Consequently, we ﬁnd that

(2.5)

c2,k = 2(2k − 1)

ζ(2k)

.

Furthermore, the k-dependence in (2.3) can be removed by deducing that the c2n,k can
be expressed generally as

(2.6)

c2n,k = 4

and C(1, 0) = 2 from equating (2.6) with (2.5). For n = 1, we ﬁnd that C(n, 1) =

Similarly, if one introduces (2.8) into (2.7), then one obtains

(2.9)

C(n, 3) =

(2n − 6)6 c2n,3 .

Therefore, we see that the C(n, j) are related to the generalized cosecant numbers. In
the next section we shall also see that the generalized cosecant numbers are related to the
symmetric polynomials over the set of positive square integers.

3. Integral approach

In this section we present a totally diﬀerent approach to evaluating the Gardner-Fisher
sum from others who have studied similar trigonometric power sums, [1]- [8], [10]- [12],
[14], [16] and [24]- [25]. The main advantage of the integral approach presented here is that
it yields a ﬁnal form for the sum that is more expedient from a computational point of view
than the other references. In addition, except for Ref. [18], it is both more informative
and compact than the other references. It also provides an independent corroboration of
the results in Ref. [18], which were obtained by empirical means. As a consequence, a
comparison of the results can be undertaken.

We begin this section by diﬀerentiating No. 8.365(10) in Ref. [13], which yields

(3.1)

π2 csc2(πx) = ψ′(x) + ψ′(1 − x) .

6

CARLOS M. DA FONSECA, M. LAWRENCE GLASSER, AND VICTOR KOWALENKO

By introducing the series form for the derivative of the digamma function, viz. ψ′(x) =
P∞
n=0 1/(n + x)2 from No. 8.363(8) of Ref. [13], we replace the summand in (3.1) by the
integral representation for the gamma function. On interchanging the order of the sum
and the integral, we obtain

π2 csc2(πx) = Z ∞

0

∞

Xn=0(cid:0)e−(n+x)t + e−(n+1−x)t(cid:1) t dt .

Next we evaluate the sums over n via the geometric series. This yields

π2 csc2(πx) = Z ∞

0 (cid:18) e−xt

1 − e−t +

e−(1−x)t

1 − e−t(cid:19) t dt .

Now we make the change of variable u = e−t, thereby arriving at

(3.2)

π2 csc2(πx) = −Z 1

0

With the aid of the following identity:

ln u

1 − u(cid:16)ux + u1−x(cid:17) du

v−1

Yn=1(cid:0)∂2

z + 4n2(cid:1) csc2 z = (2v − 1)! csc2v z ,

for v = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,

which is obtained by replacing the cos2 x by 1−sin2 x in (2.4), thereby yielding

(cid:16) d2
dx2 + 4n2(cid:17) csc2n x = 2n(2n + 1) csc2n+2 x ,

and then multiplying this resulting equation by successive values of n, we ﬁnd after an
elementary change of variable that (3.2) can be expressed as

csc2v(cid:18) kπ

where xi1 < xi2 < · · · < xin and each xij

s(v, 0) = 1 ,

s(v, 1) = (v − 1)v(2v − 1)/6 ,

and

s(v, 2) =

(cid:16)(ζ(2) − ζ(2, v))2 + ζ(4, v) − ζ(4)(cid:17) .

The integral I over u can now be evaluated by decomposing the denominator of the
integrand and applying No. 4.271(4) from Ref. [13]. Then we ﬁnd that

I = Γ(2v − 2n)ζ(2v − 2n)(m−2(v−n) − 1) .

Introducing this result into (3.4), we ﬁnally arrive at

Sm,v =

The above result for the Gardner-Fisher sum is computationally expedient because it
can be implemented as a one line instruction in Mathematica [29]. With the aid of the
SymmetricPolynomial and the gamma and zeta function routines, (3.5) can be expressed
in Mathematica as

S[m−, v−] := (1/((2 v − 1)!))Sum[(Pi/m)∧(2 n)
SymmetricPolynomial[n, Table[k∧2, k, 1, v − 1]]
Gamma[2 v − 2 n] Zeta[2 v − 2 n](1 − 1/(m∧(2 v − 2 n))), {n, 0, v − 1}]

.

If we type in the instruction

F[m,n]:= Table[Simplify[S[m,v]],{v,1,n}]

,

then we can construct a table of values of the Gardner-Fisher sum. In fact, by typing

Timing[Grid[Partition[F[m,15],1]]]

,

one obtains the ﬁrst 15 values of the Gardner-Fisher sum printed out in table form. For
a Venom Blackbook 17S Pro High Performance laptop with 8 Gb RAM and equipped
with Mathematica 10.1 these take less than 0.16 seconds to appear on the screen. Table
3.1 presents the output generated by the above instruction. We have not only been
able to present a much greater number of results than Table 2 of Ref. [18], but we have
also corrected the typographical error occurring in the last term of the second result,
which should be −7/2m4, not −7/2m2. The results have been presented in terms of
the zeta function, thereby maintaining consistency with Gardner’s limit mentioned in the
introduction. Moreover, the results can be expressed as

where pv(x) is a polynomial of degree v with the coeﬃcients pv,j satisfying

Sm,v = (2m2)−v (m2 − 1) pv−1(m2) ,

(3.6)

Table 3.1. The ﬁrst 15 (2m2)vSm,v/(m2 − 1) for v, a positive integer

As mentioned previously, values of the Gardner-Fisher sum have been obtained in
Ref. [18] by an empirical approach. According to this approach, the coeﬃcients of m−2i
in Sm,v for i < v were determined to be

(3.8)

i = c2v,i ζ(2v − 2i)(cid:16) π

In these results we have dropped dividing by ζ(2v), which occurs when this factor is taken
outside the results for Sm,v to conﬁrm Gardner’s limit. In addition, (3.9) has an extra
factor of 2v in the ﬁrst term on the rhs, which is missing in (44) of Ref. [18]. Moreover, in
a future work it will be shown that the ﬁnal coeﬃcient of Sm,v can also be expressed as

These interesting results involving the generalized cosecant numbers have been veriﬁed
by programming them in Mathematica. Furthermore, by introducing (3.11) into (2.3),
we obtain the recurrence relation for the symmetric polynomials, which is

s(n + 1, k + 1) = s(n, k + 1) + n2 s(n, k) .

4. Untwisted Dowker sum

The integral approach of the previous section can be extended to the situation where
the external normalization factor in the Gardner-Fisher sum is dropped and π/2 inside
the trigonometric power is replaced by π/ℓ, where ℓ is any integer except 0. Then by
using the same integral approach as before, we obtain

For |ℓ| 6= 1 or 2, the Hurwitz zeta function is intractable and consequently, this general-
ization of the Gardner-Fisher sum will not yield polynomials as in Table 3.1. However,

10

for the important case of ℓ = 1, which is studied extensively in Ref. [4] and is known as
the untwisted form of the Dowker sum [5], (4.1) reduces to

Because there is no normalization factor outside the sum as in the Gardner-Fisher sum,
we obtain polynomials in powers of m2 of degree v. Although these polynomials are
denoted by C2v(m) in Ref. [4], we shall denote them by qv(m2) with the coeﬃcients of
m2i represented by qv,i. From (4.2) we ﬁnd that

(4.3) qv.0 = −22v+1

and qv,v =

π2v ζ(2v) .

Moreover, we can use (3.11) to express qv,0 and qv,i in terms of the generalized cosecant
numbers. Hence, we obtain

and

qv,0 = −2

v−1

Xn=0

π2n−2v c2v,n ζ(2v − 2n) ,

qv,i =

π2i c2v,v−i ζ(2i) ,

i < v .

As in the case of the Gardner-Fisher sum, the polynomials obtained from (4.2) possess
a commnon factor of (m2 − 1). Consequently, we can simplify the presentation of the
polynomials for Sm,v,1 by removing this factor. Hence, Table 4.1 presents the ﬁrst 15
values of Sm,v,1/(m2 − 1), which were obtained by writing (4.2) as a one-line instruction
in Mathematica as we did for the Gardner-Fisher sum. In this instance the instruction
becomes

CS[m−, v−] := (2∧(2 v + 1)/(2 v - 1)!) Sum[(2 Pi/m)∧(2 n -2 v)
SymmetricPolynomial[n, Table[k∧ 2, {k, 1, v - 1}]]
Gamma[2 (v - n)] Zeta[2 (v - n)] (1 - 1/(m∧(2 (v - n)))), {n, 0, v - 1}]

Then we can use the same intructions below the instruction for the Gardner-Fisher sum
except that S[m,v] is now replaced by CS[m,v] to tabulate the polynomials and time the
calculation. The results in Table 4.1 took 0.12 seconds to compute as the same Venom
laptop mentioned previously. It should also be mentioned that the ﬁrst ﬁve results in the
table are identical to those given in Ref. [4]. In fact, these authors prove that

(4.5)

qv(cid:0)m2(cid:1) = (−1)v−1 22n

2n(cid:19) B2v−2n B(2v)

where B2v−2n are the ordinary Bernoulli numbers and B(m)
(x) are the Bernoulli polyno-
mials of order m and degree k and sometimes referred as to N¨orlund polynomals. By

(4.6)

B(2v)

2n (v) = (−1)n (2n)!

Γ(2v − 2n)

Γ(2v)

s(v, n) , n < v ,

and

2v (v) = (−1)v 4v

v−1

Xn=0

(2π)2n−2v Γ(2v − 2n) s(v, n) ζ(2v − 2n) .

In obtaining this result we have used No. 9.616 in Ref. [13], which expresses the Bernoulli
numbers in terms of the Riemann zeta function. Furthermore, introducing (3.11) into
(4.6) and (4.7) yields

B(2v)

2n (v) = (−1)n 2−2n (2n)! c2v,n , n < v ,

and

B(2v)

2v (v) = (−1)v 21−2v Γ(2v + 1)

v−1

Xn=0

π2n−2v c2v,n ζ(2v − 2n) .

The above results can be veriﬁed in Mathematica [29], where the Bernoulli polynomials
of order m and degree k are determined by using the NorlundB routine.

5. Other Sums

We can use the results of the previous sections to consider more intricate trigonometric
power sums than the Gardner-Fisher and untwisted Dowker sums. E.g., consider the
following series:

(5.1)

SCC

m,v,w,l :=

m−1

Xk=1

cot2v(cid:16) kπ

ℓm(cid:17) csc2w(cid:16) kπ

ℓm(cid:17) ,

where v ≥ 0 and w ≥ 0 excluding v + w = 0, while ℓ = 1 and ℓ = 2 correspond respec-
tively to the untwisted Dowker and Gardner-Fisher cases. We could introduce a factor of
cos (2akπ/ℓm), where a is an integer less than ℓm − 1, into the summand. For ℓ = 1, this
becomes an extension of the twisted Dowker sum [5], which we aim to study in a future
work.

The above trigonometric power sum can also be expressed as

(5.2)

SCC

m,v,w,ℓ =

m−1

Xk=1

cos2v(kπ/ℓm)

sin2v+2w(kπ/ℓm)

.

Now we replace the cosine power in the numerator by (cid:0)1 − sin2(kπ/ℓm)(cid:1)v

binomial theorem [28], thereby obtaining

and apply the

(5.3)

SCC

m,v,w,ℓ =

Xj=0

Xk=1

(−1)v−j (cid:18)v

j(cid:19) csc2w+2j(cid:16) kπ

ℓm(cid:17) .

v

m−1

Therefore, the sum represents a ﬁnite sum of Fisher-Gardner and untwisted Dowker sums
depending upon the value of ℓ.

If w + v ≤ 15, then we can use the results displayed in Tables 3.1 and 4.1 to obtain the
m,v,w,ℓ. Moreover, denoting the quantities listed in Table 3.1 as Rv(m2), i.e.

values of SCC
Rv (m2) = (2m2)vSm,v/(m2 − 1), we ﬁnd that SCC

m,v,w,2 reduces to

(5.4)

SCC

m,v,w,2 = (cid:0)m2 − 1(cid:1)

v

Xj=0

(−1)v−j(cid:18)v

j(cid:19) 2w+j

π2w+2j Rw+j(cid:0)m2(cid:1) .

AN INTEGRAL APPROACH TO THE GARDNER-FISHER AND UNTWISTED DOWKER SUMS 13

If v and w are set equal to 5 and 4 respectively, then using the values of R4 (m2) to
R9 (m2) in Table 3.1 and the above result, we ﬁnd that

SCC

m,5,4,2 =

16

− 2906805048m4 − 2535353600m6 + 2920623488m8 + 2565749760m10

194896477400625 (cid:0)m2 − 1(cid:1)(cid:0)4m2 − 1(cid:1)(cid:0)2280413161 + 712556555m2
− 3310462976m12 + 898396160m14(cid:1) .

A general formula for the ℓ = 2 case can be obtained by using Eqs. (3.8) to (3.10), which
represent the coeﬃcients of Sm,v. Then we arrive at

(5.5)

(5.6)

SCC

m,v,w,2 =

v

Xj=0

(−1)v−j(cid:18)v

j(cid:19) 22v+2j

π2v+2j

v+j

Xi=0

C v+j

i m2v+2j−2i

.

The above result can also be expressed in terms of the symmetric polynomials of quadratic
integers since from (3.8), (3.10), (3.11) and (3.13), we have

and

C v

i = (2v)−2n ζ(2v − 2i) s(v, i) ,

i < v ,

C v

v = −

v−1

Xn=0

π2n(2v)−2n ζ(2v − 2n) s(v, n) .

For ℓ = 1 or the untwisted Dowker case, we can use the results of Table 4.1 to obtain
m,v,w,1, when v + w ≤ 15. If we denote the quantities listed in

the values of the sums, SCC
the table as Tv (m2), i.e. Tv (m2) = Sm,v,1/(m2 − 1), then we ﬁnd that

(5.7)

SCC

m,v,w,1 = (cid:0)m2 − 1(cid:1)

v

Xj=0

(−1)v−j(cid:18)v

j(cid:19)Tw+j (cid:0)m2(cid:1) .

For v = 6 and w = 3, the above result with the aid of the respective values in Table 4.1
yields
m−1

cot12(cid:16)kπ

m(cid:17) csc6(cid:16) kπ

m(cid:17) =

1

194896477400625(cid:0)m2 − 1(cid:1)(cid:0)m2 − 4(cid:1) (−29787342748

+ 1960688815m2 + 3595494399m4 − 275848135m6 − 335395979m8

+ 98107275m10 − 10795297m12 + 438670m14(cid:1) .

Both (5.5) and (5.8) have been checked for speciﬁc values of m by calculating the decimal
values of the sums on the lhs and comparing them with the decimal values of the rational
quantities on the rhs’s in Mathematica. In terms of the qv,i given by (4.3) and (4.4), we
can express SCC

Xk=1

(5.8)

m,v,w,1 more generally as
v

(5.9)

SCC

m,v,w,1 =

Xj=0

j(cid:19)
(−1)v−j(cid:18)v

w+j

Xi=0

qw=j,i m2i .

Another trigonometric power sum that can be studied with the aid of the previous

sections is:

(5.10)

ST S

m,v,w,l :=

m−1

Xk=1

tan2v(cid:16) kπ

ℓm(cid:17) sec2w(cid:16) kπ

ℓm(cid:17) ,

where the same conditions apply on v and w as in (5.1). For ℓ = 2, if we replace k by
m − k, then we ﬁnd that ST S
m,v,w,2. Hence, there is no need to consider this case.

m,v,w,2 = SCC

14

CARLOS M. DA FONSECA, M. LAWRENCE GLASSER, AND VICTOR KOWALENKO

On the other hand, for ℓ = 1, there is a possibility that one of the values of k can produce
powers of cos(π/2) in the denominator when m is an even integer. Therefore, this value
of k needs to be excluded when m = 2n, where n is a non-zero integer. Therefore, we
modify the above sum to

(5.11)

ST S

2n,v,w,1 =

2n−1

Xk=1

k6=n

tan2v(cid:16) kπ

2n(cid:17) sec2w(cid:16)kπ

2n(cid:17) ,

We now split the above sum into two separate sums, the ﬁrst ranging from k = 1 to n − 1
and the second, from k = n − 1 to 2n. In the second sum we replace k by 2n − k, which
yields the ﬁrst sum again. Consequently, (5.11) reduces to

(5.12)

ST S

2n,v,w,1 = 2

2n(cid:17) sec2w(cid:16) kπ

2n(cid:17) ,

n−1

tan2v(cid:16)kπ

Xk=1
2n,v,w,1 = 2SCC

By replacing k by n−k, we ﬁnd that ST S
n,v,w,2. The case of m = 2n+1 can also be
reduced, but it yields a second trigonometric power sum with an alternating summand.
Such sums will be studied in a future work. Finally, we add that the ℓ = 1, w = 0 and
m = 2n+1 case of (5.10) has been studied by Shevelev and Moses in Ref. [26], where they
give the polynomial values of the sum for the ﬁrst ﬁve values of v.

6. Conclusion

In this paper we have presented a new integral approach for evaluating the Gardner-
Fisher sum or Sm,v as deﬁned by either (1.1) or (1.2), which is not only computationally
expedient compared with other methods, but has also enabled us to quantify the coeﬃ-
cients of the polynomials as evidenced by (3.6) to (3.7). In so doing, we have been able to
relate the generalized cosecant numbers of Ref. [19] to the symmetric polynomials s(v, n)
over the set of quadratic powers, {1, 22, 32, . . . , (v − 1)2}, via (3.11), which was achieved
by matching the general result given here by (3.5) with the empirically determined results
of (43) and (44) in Ref. [18].

To demonstrate the versatility of our integral approach, it was then extended to situ-
ations where π/2 in the trigonometric power of the Gardner-Fisher sum was replaced by
π/ℓ. As a consequence, we were able to evaluate the sums for the ℓ = 1 case or Sm,v,1,
which is known as the untwisted Dowker sum [5] and has been studied extensively by
Cvijovi´c and Srivastava [4]. The latter authors obtain a general result for the sum, which
is given by another unwieldy sum whose summand is a product of Bernoulli numbers and
the esoteric N¨orlund polynomials as in (4.5). As a result, one is unable to ascertain the
mathematical forms for the coeﬃcients of the polynomials in Sm,v,1. Hence, one has to rely
on a software package such as Mathematica to generate the ﬁnal forms for the untwisted
Dowker sum. Nevertheless, the ﬁve values presented in [4] agree with the ﬁrst ﬁve results
in Table 4.1. Furthermore, by comparing their form for the untwisted Dowker sum with
our (4.2), we are able to express the particular values of the N¨orlund polynomials in their
result either in terms of the speciﬁc symmetric polynomials s(v, n) presented here or in
terms of the generalized cosecant numbers. By using the results of the previous sections
we were able to sketch out the calculations for more intricate sums involving products of
powers of cotangent and tangent with powers of cosecant and secant respectively.

This paper, which has resulted in a cross-fertilization of the ﬁelds of classical analysis,
number theory and computational/experimental mathematics, represents the introduc-
tory work of a more ambitious programme where the ideas and methods presented here

AN INTEGRAL APPROACH TO THE GARDNER-FISHER AND UNTWISTED DOWKER SUMS 15

and in [18, 19] are to be extended beyond the trigonometric power sums appearing in
Refs. [1] and [3]. Included in this investigation will be the cases where summands alter-
nate in sign. Once again, the existing results give similar unwieldy results to (4.5) and
thus, do not provide the interesting mathematics associated with the coeﬃcients of the
resultant polynomials.
