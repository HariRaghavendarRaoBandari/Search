ABSTRACT

We develop a model of particle acceleration in explosive reconnection events in relativistic magnetically-
dominated plasmas and apply it to explain gamma-ray ﬂares from the Crab Nebula. The model relies on
development of current-driven instabilities on macroscopic scales (not related to plasma skin depths), driven
by large-scales magnetic stresses (of the type “parallel currents attract”). Using analytical and numerical
methods (ﬂuid and particle-in-cell simulations), we study a number of model problems involving merger
of both current-carrying and zero total current magnetic ﬂux tubes in relativistic magnetically-dominated
plasma: (i) we extend Syrovatsky’s classical model of explosive X-point collapse to magnetically-dominated
plasmas; (ii) we consider instability of two-dimensional force-free system of magnetic islands/ﬂux tubes (2D
“ABC” structures); (iii) we consider merger of two zero total poloidal current magnetic ﬂux tubes. In all
cases regimes of spontaneous and driven evolution are investigated.

We identify two stages of particle acceleration: (i) fast explosive prompt X-point collapse and (ii) ensuing
island merger. The fastest acceleration occurs during the initial catastrophic X-point collapse, with the
reconnection electric ﬁeld of the order of the magnetic ﬁeld. During the X-point collapse particles are
accelerated by charge-starved electric ﬁelds, which can reach (and even exceed) values of the local magnetic
ﬁeld. The explosive stage of reconnection produces non-thermal power-law tails with slopes that depend
on the average magnetization σ. For plasma magnetization σ ≤ 102 the spectrum power law index is
p < 2; in this case the maximal energy depends linearly on the size of the reconnecting islands. For higher
magnetization, σ ≥ 102, the spectra are soft, p < 2, yet the maximal energy γmax can still exceed the
average magnetic energy per particle, ∼ σ, by orders of magnitude (if p is not too close to unity). The
X-point collapse stage is followed by magnetic island merger that dissipates a large fraction of the initial
magnetic energy in a regime of forced magnetic reconnection, further accelerating the particles, but proceeds
at a slower reconnection rate.

Crab ﬂares result from the initial explosive stages of magnetic island mergers of magnetic ﬂux tubes
produced in the bulk of nebula at intermediate polar regions. The Crab pulsar produces polar-angle de-
pendent magnetized wind which is magnetically-dominated at medium polar angles. Post-termination shock

1. Crab Nebula gamma-ray ﬂares: observational constraints and theoretical challenges

The detection of ﬂares from Crab Nebula by AGILE and Fermi satellites (Tavani et al. 2011; Abdo et al. 2011;
Buehler et al. 2012) is one of the most astounding discoveries in high energy astrophysics. The unusually short durations,
high luminosities, and high photon energies of the Crab Nebula gamma-ray ﬂares require reconsideration of our basic
assumptions about the physical processes responsible for acceleration of the highest-energy emitting particles in the
Crab Nebula, and, possibly in other high-energy astrophysical sources. During ﬂares, the Crab Nebula gamma-ray ﬂux
above 100 MeV exceeded its average value by a factor of several or higher, while in other energy bands nothing unusual
was observed (Weisskopf et al. 2013).

The discovery of ﬂares from Crab Nebula, exhibiting unusually short durations, high luminosities, and high photon
energies, challenges our understanding of particle acceleration in PWNe, and, possibly in other high-energy astrophysical
sources. On the one hand, the low magnetization numerical models of Crab Nebula (Komissarov & Lyubarsky 2004;
Del Zanna et al. 2004; Lyutikov et al. 2016) are able to reproduce the morphological details of the Crab Nebula down
to intricate details. Lyutikov et al. (2016) demonstrated that the inner knot of the Crab nebula is produced by a low
magnetization section of the pulsar wind passing through the termination shock. The implied acceleration mechanism
is then the acceleration at the termination shock (Rees & Gunn 1974; Kennel & Coroniti 1984), presumably via the
stochastic Fermi-type process. This is currently the dominant paradigm.

On the other hand, contrary to the exceptionally detailed explanation of the morphological features, low magnetiza-
tion models cannot reproduce the spectrum both of the stationary emission (Lyutikov 2010) and especially of the ﬂares
(Clausen-Brown & Lyutikov 2012). Even before the discovery of Crab ﬂares Lyutikov (2010) argued that the observed
cutoﬀ in synchrotron spectrum of the Crab Nebula at ∼ 100 MeV in the persistent Crab Nebula emission is too high
to be consistent with the stochastic shock acceleration. Indeed, balancing electrostatic acceleration in a regular electric
ﬁeld with synchrotron energy losses yields the synchrotron photon energy max ∼ η mc3
e2 ≈ 100 MeV. where η is the
ratio of the average accelerating electric ﬁeld to magnetic ﬁeld strengths. Since high conductivity of astrophysical plasma
ensures that in most circumstances η ≤ 1, the observed value of the cutoﬀ is right at the very limit. This estimate is
conﬁrmed by self-consistent PIC simulations of particle acceleration rates at unmagnetized shocks (Sironi et al. 2013).

– 5 –

During the gamma-ray ﬂares the cutoﬀ energy approached even higher value of ∼ 400 MeV, suggesting Doppler
boosting or a diﬀerent acceleration mechanism. In addition, recent optical observations show no signiﬁcant variability of
the brightest features associated with the termination shock (Weisskopf et al. 2013; Rudy et al. 2015a), apparently ruling
out the shock acceleration as a mechanism behind the ﬂares. Thus, low magnetization models reproduce the Crab PWN
morphology, but the implied acceleration mechanism, the stochastic shock acceleration, fails to reproduce the spectrum.

There is a number of possible resolutions of the problem. First, bulk relativistic motion reduces the requirement
on the acceleration rate in the rest frame by the Doppler factor. Though no relativistic motion is observed in the bulk
of the nebula, it is possible to have mildly relativistic motion, with the Doppler factor of a few, in speciﬁc locations,
e.g., near the axial part of the ﬂow produced by a highly anisotropic pulsar wind (Komissarov & Lyubarsky 2004;
Komissarov & Lyutikov 2011). A highly anisotropic pulsar wind produces non-spherical termination shock, in which
case the post-shock Lorentz factor can be at least of the order of the inverse of the angle of attack and even higher for
high-sigma wind. 1 Sonic perturbation propagating from the downstream ﬂow can then induce short variations in the
synchrotron emission (Lyutikov et al. 2012).

An alternative possibility is that magnetic reconnection in highly magnetized plasma is responsible for the acceler-
ation of the wind leptons (Lyutikov 2010; Cerutti et al. 2014a, 2013). How can these contradicting arguments (i.e., low
magnetization that explains the morphology and high magnetization needed for eﬃcient acceleration) be reconciled?
Sironi & Spitkovsky (2011a); Komissarov (2013); Lyubarsky (2012) pointed out that while particle acceleration may be
eﬃcient at the termination shock of the equatorial striped section of pulsar wind, it is unlikely to operate in the polar
section which is free from stripes (see also Sironi & Spitkovsky (2012)). Through this section of the shock, a highly
magnetized plasma must be injected into the nebula and the magnetic reconnection in this plasma could be responsible
for the observed ﬂares. Moreover, the magnetic dissipation is needed to reconcile the observed sub-equipartition mag-
netic ﬁeld of the Crab Nebula with its theoretical models. This conclusion is supported by the recent 3D numerical
simulations of PWNe by Porth et al. (2013), who demonstrated that indeed magnetic ﬂux can be eﬃciently dissipated via
reconnection events. In the model of Porth et al. (2013) the pulsar wind has both the low-sigma sectors (this reproduces
the overall morphology of the PWN), as well as high-sigma sectors (this allows the existence of highly magnetized plasma
in the post-shock region). It is within these highly magnetized regions, at intermediate latitudes, that we envision the
reconnection processes taking place.

The microphysics of the acceleration in relativistic reconnection layers has been addressed by a number of col-
laborations (e.g., Bessho & Bhattacharjee 2012; Guo et al. 2015; Deng et al. 2015, and others).
In particular, the
Colorado group (Uzdensky et al. 2011; Cerutti et al. 2012a,c, 2013) simulated the development of the tearing mode in
the relativistic highly magnetized plasma aiming to explain Crab ﬂares. In tearing mode instability of a relativistic
current layer (see also Lyutikov 2003a; Komissarov et al. 2007): after a short time a quasi-stationary relativistic recon-
nection reconnection layer is set-up. One of the demands on the acceleration mechanism imposed by the observations
of Crab ﬂares is that acceleration must proceed exceptionally fast and occur on macroscopic scales. This requirement
is, generally, not satisﬁed in tearing-mode based models.

There is a number of features of the approach of the Colorado group that we ﬁnd unsatisfactory. First, in the
collisionless plasma the typical thickness of the tearing-mode driven reconnection layer is microscopic - related to the
plasma skin depth. The length of the magnetic ﬂux tube might be somewhat larger than it’s transverse size, but not
much larger: long thin current-carrying ﬂux tubes created during the development of a tearing mode are unstable due to
kink instability on scales, typically, few times their transverse size Zenitani & Hoshino (2007); Daughton et al. (2011);
Karimabadi et al. (2013). As we argue below in §9.5, a typical potential available over a few skin depths is too small

1Parameter σ is deﬁned as twice the ratio of the rest-frame magnetic energy density to plasma enthalpy w (rest mass energy density for

cold plasma, σ = B2/(4πw) → B2/(4πnmec2)

to account for the observed particles’ energies. (In the presence of the guide ﬁeld, on the one hand, the ﬂux tubes
are stabilized, and can extend to scales much longer than the transverse size of few skin depth, but on the other hand
the reconnection rate, and thus the eﬃciency of acceleration are reduced (Zenitani & Hoshino 2008).) Second, in a
quasi-stationary regime and at scales much larger than the skin depth the velocity of the inﬂow into the reconnection
layer is small, much smaller than the speed of light. Recent studies of relativistic reconnection by means of 2D and 3D
PIC simulations have demonstrated that, for a reference magnetization σ = 10 (i.e., ten times more energy in magnetic
ﬁelds than in the plasma rest mass), the reconnection rate in anti-parallel reconnection (i.e., in the absence of a guide
ﬁeld perpendicular to the reconnection plane) is much smaller in 3D, where rrec ∼ 0.02, than in 2D, where rrec ∼ 0.1
(Sironi & Spitkovsky 2014). As a result of slow inﬂowing velocity, much smaller than the speed of light, it is hard to
(i) produce electric ﬁelds within the reconnection region that are of the same order as magnetic ﬁelds; (ii) it is hard
to reconcile the overall energetics of ﬂares: small inﬂow velocities do not allow the emission to tap a suﬃciently large
volume of magnetic energy during the short duration of the ﬂares. Also, the development of the tearing mode generally
does not lead to global reconﬁgurations - it typically results in a local dissipation event (like saw-tooth oscillations in
TOKAMAKs Fisch 1987). Finally, and most importantly, Crab ﬂares require acceleration to Lorentz factors γ ∼ 109.
In the simulations of (Uzdensky et al. 2011; Cerutti et al. 2012a,c, 2013) all the particles present within the acceleration
region are accelerated. If all the particles within a volume are accelerated, their terminal Lorentz factor is γp,max ∼ σ.
This requires regions with magnetization σ ∼ 109 - such highly magnetized regions are unlikely to exist with the Nebula.
Finally, the initial set-up in the simulations by (Uzdensky et al. 2011; Cerutti et al. 2012a,c, 2013) is not force-free - it
already has particles with energy σ, while the ﬁnal γp,max ∼ 4σ.

In this paper we develop an alternative model of reconnection in highly magnetized plasma, that overcomes all of the
above-mentioned problems related to the tearing-mode instabilities in the plane-parallel geometry. Most importantly,
reconnection in our model is explosive, occurs on macroscopic scales (not related to plasma skin depth), the electric
ﬁelds approach magnetic ﬁelds in the bulk and, thus, are an order of magnitude higher than in the case considered by
Cerutti et al. (2012a,c) (large inﬂow velocities allow to tap into larger energy containing volume and larger number of
particles). Importantly, only a small relative number of particles is accelerated - thus, the terminal Lorentz factor is not
limited by σ.

2. Large scale dynamics of PWNe - formation of current-carrying ﬂux tubes

2.1. Post-shock ﬂow of magnetized plasma: natural formation of highly magnetized regions

The powerful Crab ﬂares require that energy from a macroscopic scale is made available to the acceleration process.
As we will discuss in the following, current-driven MHD instabilities like the coalescence of parallel currents and the
”X-point collapse” can be a viable way to achieve this. One of the key questions is then how a violently unstable and
highly magnetized conﬁguration is setup in the ﬁrst place. To locate potential sites for the ﬂaring region, we need to
identify regions of high sigma and analyze the ﬂow structure in these candidate ﬂaring regions. Here we use the result
of simulations by Porth et al. (2014a). Although the scales required for the “daily” ﬂare duration are not resolved by
the simulation (its resolution is > 3 light-days), it is instructive to correlate the high-sigma region (that forms as a
consequence of ﬂow-expansion) with the current distribution in the simulations.

As Lyutikov et al. (2016) discuss, the modeling of the inner knot of the Crab Nebula requires that the equatorial
ﬂow is weakly magnetized. Intermediate latitudes can still be highly magnetized. In fact, highly magnetized regions
in the bulk of the nebula can be achieved via ﬂow expansion at intermediate latitude regions starting with only mildly
magnetized wind. In Fig. 1 we show the magnetization in the xy-plane from simulations of (Porth et al. 2014a). One
can clearly see that the magnetization rises well above the maximal injected value of σ = 1. The highest value of σ ≈ 8
in the snapshot is achieved at the point where radial expansion reverses and forms the plume-like polar ﬂow.

stream lines. There is a clearly visible region of high magnetization at intermediate latitudes.

2.2. Current ﬁlamentation

As the mildly relativistic post-shock ﬂow decelerates, it comes into a global causal contact. Once causally connected,
the almost purely toroidal magnetic conﬁguration of the nebula ﬂow is liable to current-driven instabilities (e.g. Begelman
1998; Mizuno et al. 2011). As pointed out by Lyubarsky (2012), in a highly magnetized expanding post-shock ﬂow, the
ﬂow lines are in fact focussed to the axis via the magnetic hoop-stress which can act as an additional trigger for instability.
Thereby the innermost ﬂow reaches the recollimation point ﬁrst and is expected to experience violent instability and
magnetic dissipation. Lyubarsky (2012) hence argues that the γ-ray ﬂares originate in the polar region at the base of
the observed jet/plume. On the one hand, the simulations of Porth et al. (2014a) are in agreement with this dynamical
picture and show development of m ∼ f ew modes that lead to the formation of current ﬁlaments at the jet base. On
the other hand, for numerical stability, Porth et al. (2014a) could only study moderate polar magnetizations of σ ≤ 3
which disfavours rapid particle acceleration. Even without this technical limitation, for non-vanishing wind power, the
axis itself cannot carry a DC Poynting ﬂux. Because of this, we are interested in ﬂow lines from intermediate latitudes
that acquire high sigma due to ﬂow expansion.

To visualize the current in the simulations, we now cut the domain by spherical surfaces and investigate current-
magnitude and magnetization in the φθ-plane. The white circles in Fig. 1 indicates the location of the innermost
spherical test-surface shown in the top panel of Fig. 2. In general, the current exhibits a quadrupolar morphology,
it is distributed smoothly over the polar regions and returns near the equator. When the test-surface crosses over
the termination shock, we observe an increased return-current due to the shock jump of Bφ. Although the ﬁeld is
predominantly toroidal in the high sigma downstream region, perturbations from the unstable jet occasionally lead to
current ﬁlaments and even reversals just downstream of the termination shock.

With increasing distance from the termination-shock, the ﬂow becomes more and more turbulent which leads to
increased ﬁlamentation and copious sign changes of the radial current. In the underlying simulations, the magnetization
in the turbulent regions has dropped already below unity which disfavours rapid particle acceleration at distances larger
than a few termination shock radii.
It is interesting to point out that although the magnetic ﬁeld injected in the
model decreases gradually over a large striped region of 45◦, an equatorial current sheet develops none the less in the
nebula. This can be seen in the lower panel of Fig.2 which corresponds to a surface outside of the termination shock at
r = 3 × 1017cm.

To better understand the geometry of the current and magnetic ﬁeld, we display a representative volume rendering
of the polar region in Fig. 3.
In the rendering, one can see the violently unstable polar beam embedded into the
more regular high-σ region comprised of toroidal ﬁeld lines. The plume forms downstream of this structure and is also
strongly perturbed. A part of the disrupted plume approaches the termination shock as a ﬂux-tube. The presence
of such a conﬁguration where two ﬂux tubes can come together very close to the high sigma region lets us speculate
that Crab ﬂares might originate when the right geometry (e.g. parallel ﬂux tubes) coincides with high magnetization
as present in the nebula even for moderate wind magnetization. For higher magnetizations of the polar beam, the
mechanism described by Lyubarsky (2012) could directly act also without ﬁrst having to rely on enhancement of σ via
ﬂow expansion. Extrapolating from the moderate sigma simulations where the polar beam is highly unstable and forms
a ﬁlamented current, this seems feasible at the very least.

A targeted investigation of the Crab nebula polar ﬂow also with higher magnetization of σ up to 10 was performed by
Mignone et al. (2013) through injecting a jet into the shocked nebula ambient. The model is appropriate for the lightyear
scale plume but lacks the formation of the jet via the hoop-stress in the nebula. To match the kinked morphology of
the observations of the plume, models with moderate bulk Lorentz factors Γ = 2 are favoured. Fragmentation of the
current and highly intermittent structures also develop in the large scale ﬂow, but with time-scales of not much less
than a year. The highest variability and potential reconnection sites are localized at the termination zone of the jet at

the edge of the nebula. At this point the magnetization has dropped considerably due to internal dissipation. These
features speak against the large scale jet as a site for the γ-ray ﬂares.

In conclusion, large scale simulations indicate that even for mildly magnetized winds (for wind magnetization σw ≥
few) the post-shock ﬂow naturally forms highly magnetized regions. These regions are unstable to large scale current-
driven instabilities that lead to the formation of current/magnetic ﬁlaments.
In the following sections we discuss a
number of plasma-physical models that can lead to impulsive particle acceleration in such conﬁgurations.

3. X-point collapse in force-free plasma

Explosive release of magnetic energy is a well known phenomenon in laboratory and space plasmas (e.g., Priest
& Forbes 2000). One of the promising line of research follows the work of Syrovatskii (Imshennik & Syrovatskivi 1967;
Syrovatskii 1975, 1981) on the explosive collapse of a magnetic X-point (see also Cowley & Artun 1997). In this Section
we consider explosive X-point collapse and particle acceleration in highly magnetized relativistic plasma.

3.1. Dynamic force-free plasma

The properties of plasma in many high energy astrophysics sources are very diﬀerent from those of more conventional
Solar and laboratory plasmas. The principal diﬀerence is that it is relativistically strongly magnetized, σ = uB/up (cid:29) 1,
where uB = B2/8π is the magnetic energy density and up is the plasma energy density (including the rest mass). The
parameter regime of highly magnetized plasma, σ (cid:29) 1, implies that (i) the inertia of this plasma is dominated by the
magnetic ﬁeldand not by the particle rest mass, B2/8π (cid:29) ρc2, (ii) the propagation speed of Alfv´en waves approaches
the speed of light, (iii) the conduction current ﬂows mostly along the magnetic ﬁeldlines, (iv) the displacement current
(c/4π)∂tE may be of the same order as the conduction current, j, (v) the electric charge density, ρe, may be of the
order of j/c. These are very diﬀerent from the properties of laboratory plasmas, plasmas of planetary magnetospheres,
and the interplanetary plasma, the cases where plenty of experimental data and theoretical results exist (Lyutikov &
Lazarian 2014).

The large expected value of σ (or small 1/σ) may be used as an expansion parameter in the equations of relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics. The zero order equations describe the so-called relativistic force-free approximation. One may
see this limit as the model where massless charged particles support currents and charge densities such that the total
Lorentz force vanishes all the time (this also insures the ideal condition E· B = 0.) This allows one to related the current
to electro-magnetic ﬁelds (Uchida 1997; Gruzinov 1999)

This may be considered as the Ohm’s law for ideal relativistic force-free electro-dynamics (the electromagnetic invariant
E · B = 0; that electromagnetic energy is conserved, E · J = 0.)

In a modiﬁcation of the ideal approach, one can also study dissipative processes in force-free electro-dynamics (e.g.,
Lyutikov 2003a; Li et al. 2012, ; importantly, only parallel component of the electric current is subject to resistive
dissipation). In §4.1 we use a variant of the resistive force-free, Eq. (15).

3.2. Stressed X-point collapse in force-free plasma: analytical solution

Let us consider the X-point collapse in a force-free plasma, with the Ohm’s law given by (1). Consider a vicinity
of a magnetic X-point. The non-current-carrying conﬁguration has null lines intersecting at 90 degrees. Following the
classic work on the collapse of a non-relativistic X-point (Dungey 1953; Imshennik & Syrovatskivi 1967; Priest & Forbes
2000), let us assume that the initial conﬁguration is squeezed by a factor λ, so that the initial conﬁguration has a vector
potential Az ∝ x2 − y2/λ2. In addition, we assume that there is an axial constant magnetic ﬁeld B0. 2

2 In Appendix A we demonstrate, using force-free and PIC simulations, that an unstressed X-point is stable to small-scale perturbations.

These solutions are valid for x, y ≤ (B0/B⊥)L, or, in other words, as long as the in-plane magnetic ﬁeld is smaller that
B0. (Note that for the unsqueezed conﬁguration, λ = α = 1, the magnetic ﬁeld near the null is an expansion of a
force-free multiple island conﬁguration (29) with B⊥ = B0/(2π).)

Solutions of the equations (6) show that “the sqeezinees” parameter a(t) has a ﬁnite time singularity for λ < 1: in
ﬁnite time a becomes inﬁnite, see Fig. 5. (For λ > 1 in ﬁnite time a becomes zero, so that b becomes inﬁnite.) Thus,
we have generalized the classic solution of Imshennik & Syrovatskivi (1967) to the case of force-free plasma. At the
moment when one of the parameters a or b becomes zero, the current sheet forms, see Fig. 4.

The structure of the electric ﬁeld in the x− y plane does not change during the collapse and qualitatively resembles
the initial conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld. The z-component of the electric ﬁeld evolves from a slightly squeezed
parabola at small times, Ez ∝ (x2λ2 + y2a4) to a trough-shape at later times, Ez ∝ y2. (At time t = 0 the electric ﬁeld
is zero.)

At these times the particle drift motion follows a trajectory in the x − y plane y ∝ 1/x. During the ﬁnal collapse, in
the limit a → ∞, the particle distribution is further squeezed towards the neutral layer, y ∝ 1/(a2√ln x) (though in
this limit the drift approximation becomes inapplicable.) This shows that the X-point is stretched in one direction and
is compressed in the other direction (note that ∇v = 0 - collapse is incompressible at the initial stage).

We have also veriﬁed that the evolution of the system in case of slowly developing or periodic stress proceeds in a
similar fashion, Fig. 6. The collapse develops slowly until stress reaches, approximately, 50% value, after which collapse
proceeds very fast. If subject to periodic perturbation, e.g., λ = 1 − δ sin(ωt), the collapse always occurs - reversing
the stress does not stop the collapse, only prolongs it, Fig. 6.b.

3.3. Expected charge starvation during collapse

During the X-point collapse the electromagnetic ﬁelds and currents experience a sharp growth, especially near the

null line. The current density at the null line is

(assuming a (cid:29) 1). Since a → ∞ during collapse, the current density similarly increases during the collapse. As the
parameter a grows, this imposes larger and larger demand on the velocity of the current-carrying particles. But the

In our PIC simulations, §4.2, L/δ = 800, while σL = 4 × 103 − 4 × 104, where we have deﬁned σL to be the value
of the magnetization at L. At diﬀerent distances, the magnetization changes with the square of the distance. Thus we
expect that the charge starvation occurs approximately at a ∼ few, when the opening of the X-point becomes tens of
degrees. These estimates are in agreement with the PIC runs.

Thus, in an ideal relativistic force-free plasma a stressed X-point undergoes a ﬁnite time collapse. The assumption
of the force-free plasma will be broken down when the inﬂow velocity would become of the order of the Alfv´en velocity
and/or when the charge starvation regime is reached. Then, the maximum electric ﬁeld is E ∼ βAB⊥ which is of the
order of B0, magnetic ﬁeld in the bulk, for σ ≥ 1.

4. X-point collapse: numerical simulations

4.1. Force-free simulations: X-point collapse

Next we compare the analytical results described above with numerical simulations. First we do force-free simula-

tions. In force-free simulations, we solve the system of Maxwell equations supplemented with the Ohm law

j = 

E×B
B2 c + κ(cid:107)E(cid:107) + κ⊥E⊥.

(15)

In the Ohm law, the ﬁrst term represents the drift current, where the electric charge density ρ is found from the Gauss
law. The second and third terms are the conductivity current along and perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld respectively.
κ⊥ is set to zero unless E > B, in which case it is set to a high value in order to quickly obtain E ≤ B. κ(cid:107) is always set
to a high value in order to quickly drive the solution towards the force-free state with E(cid:107) = 0. The numerical approach
is described in details in Komissarov et al. (2007). It is second order in space and time with the source terms treated
using the Strand-splitting algorithm. The method of Generalized Lagrange Multiplier (GLM) is employed to keep the
magnetic ﬁeld almost divergence-free.

The X-point collapse simulations are initialized with vanishing electric ﬁeld and the magnetic ﬁeld described by Eq.
(7), with parameters a = 1, λ = √0.5, L = 1, B⊥ = 1 B0 = 1. The computational grid is a two-dimensional Cartesian
grid with 400 × 400 cells covering the x-y domain [−2, 2] × [−2, 2]. We imposed the zero-gradient boundary conditions,
which leads to deformations of the X-point conﬁguration near boundaries which propagate towards the center with the
speed of light. However, these waves do not reach the central area of interest on the simulation time scale. Fig. 7 shows
the magnetic ﬁeld lines and the strength of the guide ﬁeld B0 in the central area of the size L at four instances during
the time interval [0, 1]. One can see the expected rapid collapse of the squeezed X-point.

Fig. 8 shows the evolution of the parameter a, which is measured using Eq.7 as

a(t) = λ1/2(xBx/yBy)1/4 ,

and the strength of the electric ﬁeld, both computed at the point (x, y) = (−0.1, 0.1). which is inside the domain of
applicability of the solution (8), namely x, y (cid:28) (B0/B⊥)λ2L. One can see that although the characteristic time scale
is close to τ = 1 based on the analytical solution, the numerical solution does not quite follow the analytical one. This
is because the constraint on the length scale also sets the limitation on the time-scale t (cid:28) (B0/B⊥)λ2(L/c) = λ2τ .
Moreover, as one can see in Fig. 7, the guide ﬁeld already shows signiﬁcant evolution on this time-scale, contrary to
what is assumed in the analytic solution.

For t (cid:29) τ the solution exhibits self-similar evolution – this is expected as the only characteristic length scale of this
problem is lg = (B0/B⊥)L. Its main properties are illustrated in Fig. 9. The contours of B2 − E2 are elongated along
the x axis. The X-point is replaced by a thin current sheet with two Y-points at its ends. Ahead of each of Y-point
there are bow-shaped regions where the drift speed is very close to c and E (cid:39) B.

4.2. PIC simulations of stressed X-point collapse

4.2.1. Overall principles and parameters of PIC simulations

The most fundamental method for simulating the kinetic dynamics of a reconnecting plasma involves the use of
particle-in-cell (PIC) codes, that evolve the discretized equations of electrodynamics — Maxwell’s equations and the
Lorentz force law (Hockney & Eastwood 1981; Birdsall & Langdon 1991). PIC codes can model astrophysical plasmas
from ﬁrst principles, as a collection of charged macro-particles — each representing many physical particles — that are
moved by integration of the Lorentz force.3 The electric currents associated with the macro-particles are deposited on
a grid, where Maxwell’s equations are discretized. Electromagnetic ﬁelds are then advanced via Maxwell’s equations,
with particle currents as the source term. Finally, the updated ﬁelds are extrapolated to the particle locations and used
for the computation of the Lorentz force, so the loop is closed self-consistently.

We study the collapse of a solitary X-point with 2D PIC simulations, employing the massively parallel electro-
magnetic PIC code TRISTAN-MP (Buneman 1993; Spitkovsky 2005). Our computational domain is a square in the
x− y plane, which is initialized with a uniform density of cold electron-positron plasma (the composition of pulsar wind
nebulae is inferred to have negligible ion/proton component). The simulation is initialized with a vanishing electric
ﬁeld and with the magnetic ﬁeld appropriate for a stressed X-point collapse (see Eq. (7)) with λ = 1/√2, for direct
comparison with the force-free results described above.4 The stressed X-point conﬁguration would require a particle
current in the direction perpendicular to the simulation plane, to sustain the curl of the ﬁeld (which, on the other hand,
is absent in the case of an unstressed X-point). In our setup, the computational particles are initialized at rest, but
such electric current gets self-consistently built up within a few timesteps. At the boundaries of the box, the ﬁeld is
reset at every timestep to the initial conﬁguration. This leads to a deformation of the self-consistent X-point evolution
which propagates from the boundaries toward the center at the speed of light. However, our domain is chosen to be
large enough such that this perturbation does not reach the central area of interest within the timespan covered by our
simulations.

We perform two sets of simulations. First, we explore the physics at relatively early times with a 2D Cartesian grid
of 32768 × 32768 cells. The spatial resolution is such that the plasma skin depth c/ωp is resolved with 10 cells.5 The
unit length is L = 800 c/ωp, so that the domain size is a square with (cid:39) 4L on each side. The physical region of interest
is the central 2L × 2L square. The simulation is evolved up to ∼ L/c, so that the artiﬁcial perturbation driven by the
boundaries does not aﬀect the region of interest. In a second set of simulations, we explore the physics at late times,
with a 2D Cartesian box of 40960×40960 cells, with spatial resolution c/ωp = 1.25 cells. With the unit length still being
L = 800 c/ωp, the overall system is a square of (cid:39) 41L on each side. At early times, the evolution is entirely consistent
with the results of the ﬁrst set of simulations described above, which suggests that a spatial resolution of c/ωp = 1.25
cells is still suﬃcient to capture the relevant physics (more generally, we have checked for numerical convergence from
c/ωp = 1.25 cells up to c/ωp = 20 cells). We follow the large-scale system up to ∼ 6L/c, so that the evolution of the
physical region at the center stays unaﬀected by the boundary conditions.

For both sets of simulations, each cell is initialized with two positrons and two electrons (with a small thermal
dispersion of kT /mc2 = 10−4), but we have checked that our results are the same when using up to 24 particles per

3For this work, we employ the Vay pusher, since we ﬁnd that it is more accurate than the standard Boris algorithm in dealing with the

relativistic drift velocities associated with the reconnection ﬂows (Vay 2008).

4We have also explicitly veriﬁed that an unstressed X-point (i.e., with λ = 1) is stable.

cell. In order to reduce noise in the simulation, we ﬁlter the electric current deposited onto the grid by the particles,
eﬀectively mimicking the eﬀect of a larger number of particles per cell (Spitkovsky 2005; Belyaev 2015).

We explore the dependence of our results on two physical parameters, namely the strength of the guide ﬁeld and
the ﬂow magnetization. In one set of simulations, the strength of the guide ﬁeld B0 (which is uniform across the box)
is chosen to be equal to the in-plane ﬁeld B⊥ at the scale L, as measured along the unstressed direction (i.e., the x
direction, in our setup). Due to the linear increase of the in-plane ﬁelds with distance from the center, along the stressed
direction (i.e., the x direction, in our setup) the in-plane and guide ﬁelds will be equal at a distance of λ2L = L/2 from
the center. The case of guide-ﬁeld collapse allows for a direct comparison with analytical theory and force-free results.
In the second set of simulations, we initialize the system with a vanishing guide ﬁeld. This case will be relevant for our
investigation of the collapse of ABC structures. There, we will demonstrate that particle acceleration is most eﬃcient
at null points, i.e., where both the in-plane ﬁelds and the out-of-plane guide ﬁeld vanish.

In addition to the guide ﬁeld strength, we investigate the dependence of our results on the ﬂow magnetization,
which for a cold electron-positron plasma is deﬁned as σ = B2/4πmnc2.6 The physics of X-point collapse has been
widely studied in the literature with PIC simulations (Tsiklauri & Haruki 2007, 2008; Graf von der Pahlen & Tsiklauri
2014; von der Pahlen & Tsiklauri 2014), but only in the non-relativistic regime σ (cid:28) 1. To the best of our knowledge,
our investigation is the ﬁrst to focus on the relativistic regime σ (cid:29) 1, which is appropriate for relativistic astrophysical
outﬂows. In the following, we identify our runs via the initial value of the magnetization σL at the distance L (along
the unstressed x direction), measured only with the in-plane ﬁelds (so, excluding the guide ﬁeld).7 We explore three
values of σL: 4 × 102, 4 × 103 and 4 × 104.

4.2.2. Stressed X-point collapse with guide ﬁeld

Figure 10 shows the initial phase (ct/L ≤ 1) of the collapse of a solitary X-point in PIC simulations with λ = 1/√2
and with guide ﬁeld B0 = B⊥, for two diﬀerent magnetizations: σL = 4 × 103 (left) and σL = 4 × 104 (right). The
expected rapid collapse of the squeezed X-point is clearly visible, and in excellent agreement with the 2D results of
force-free simulations, as shown in Fig. 7. The out-of-plane magnetic ﬁeld Bz is compressed toward the y = 0 plane, in
agreement with force-free results, but in apparent contradiction with the analytical solution, that assumed no evolution
of the guide ﬁeld. The 2D pattern of Bz in PIC simulations is remarkably independent of the magnetization (compare
left and right), for the early phases presented in Fig. 10.

The fact that PIC results at early times are independent of σL is further illustrated in Fig. 11, where we present the
temporal evolution of various quantities from PIC simulations of solitary X-point collapse with guide ﬁeld B0 = B⊥, for
three values of the magnetization: σL = 4 × 102 (blue), σL = 4 × 103 (green) and σL = 4 × 104 (red). Both the value of
a(t) = λ1/2(Bx/By)1/4 and of the electric ﬁeld E(t) (in units of B0) at the location (−0.1L, 0.1L) are independent of σL,
as long as ct/L (cid:46) 1, and they are in excellent agreement with the results of force-free simulations presented in Fig. 8. In
other words, the physics at early times is entirely regulated by large-scale electromagnetic stresses, with no appreciable
particle kinetic eﬀects. Carried along by the converging magnetic ﬁelds of the collapsing X-point, particles are ﬂowing
into the central region, with a reconnection speed of ∼ 0.2c (averaged over a square of side equal to L around the center).
This should be compared with the typical reconnection rate measured in relativistic guide-ﬁeld reconnection in the case

6In the case of a hot plasma, the general deﬁnition of the magnetization is σ = B2/4πw, where w = nmc2 + ˆγp/(ˆγ − 1); here, w is the

enthalpy, p is the pressure and ˆγ is the adiabatic index.

7Given the form assumed for the magnetic ﬁelds, and since the particle density is uniform in our simulation domain, the magnetization

increases quadratically with distance from the X-point.

magnetizations: σL = 4 × 103 (left) and σL = 4 × 104 (right). The plots show the out-of-plane ﬁeld Bz at ct/L =0.25,

of a plane-parallel ﬁeld conﬁguration, i.e., when the in-plane ﬁelds are initialized along the x direction throughout the
domain. Such a conﬁguration leads to vrec/c ∼ 0.02 for a guide ﬁeld equal to the alternating ﬁeld (Sironi & Spitkovsky
2016, in prep.), which is much smaller than the value attained in the present case of X-point collapse.8

As the system evolves and the a(t) parameter increases, the electric current is bound to become charge-starved, as
we have argued in Sect. 3.3. In Fig. 11, this is clearly indicated by the time when the force-free condition E · B = 0
is violated, as shown in panel (d). In agreement with the argument in Sect. 3.3, higher values of σL lead to an earlier
onset of charge starvation: the simulation with σL = 4 × 104 becomes charge starved at ct/L (cid:39) 0.75, the simulation
with σL = 4 × 103 at ct/L (cid:39) 1.1 and the simulation with σL = 4 × 102 at ct/L (cid:39) 1.5. The onset of charge starvation
is accompanied by a deviation of the curves in panels (a) and (b) from the results of force-free simulations, where the
condition E · B = 0 is imposed by hand at all times.

The physics of charge starvation is illustrated in Fig. 12, for the case σL = 4×104 that corresponds to the red curves
in Fig. 11. In response to the growing electromagnetic stress (and so, to the increasing curl of the magnetic ﬁeld), the
z velocity of the charge carriers has to increase (Fig. 12(a), for positrons), while their density stays nearly unchanged.
When the drifting speed reaches the speed of light, at ct/L (cid:39) 0.8 in Fig. 12(a), the particle electric current cannot
sustain the curl of the magnetic ﬁeld any longer, and the system must deviate from the force-free condition E· B = 0. In
fact, panel (b) shows that the value of E · B departs from zero at ct/L (cid:39) 0.8, i.e., right when the particle drift velocity
approaches the speed of light. The nonzero E · B triggers the onset of eﬃcient particle acceleration, as shown by the
proﬁle of the mean particle Lorentz factor in panel (c). Indeed, the locations of eﬃcient particle acceleration (i.e., where

8We point out that the value we obtain is consistent with the ﬁndings of Liu et al. (2015). The critical diﬀerence, though, is that their
measurement was performed on microscopic skin-depth scales, whereas our results show that signiﬁcant reconnection speeds can be achieved
over macroscopic scales L (cid:29) c/ωp.

As a function of time, we plot: (a) the value of a(t) = λ1/2(Bx/By)1/4 at the location (−0.1L, 0.1L), to be compared
with the result of force-free simulations in the left panel of Fig. 8; (b) the value of the electric ﬁeld strength E(t) at

(cid:104)γ(cid:105) (cid:29) 1) are spatially coincident with the regions where E · B (cid:54)= 0. There, the pressure of accelerated particles provides
a signiﬁcant back-reaction onto the ﬁeld collapse, and the agreement with the force-free results necessarily fails.

B0 = B⊥ and magnetization σL = 4 × 104, which corresponds to the red curves in Fig. 11. As a function of the
coordinate y along the inﬂow direction, we plot: (a) the bulk speed of positrons, in units of the speed of light (the
bulk speed of electrons is equal and opposite); (b) the parameter E · B/B2
0 , which explicitly shows when the force-free
condition E · B = 0 is falsiﬁed; (c) the mean particle Lorentz factor.

As shown in Fig. 11(e), the maximum particle energy dramatically increases, after the onset of charge starvation.
It is this rapid period of acceleration that will be extensively studied in the following sections. Here, and hereafter, the
maximum particle Lorentz factor plotted in Fig. 11(e) is deﬁned as

(cid:82) γncutdN/dγ dγ
(cid:82) γncut−1dN/dγ dγ

γmax =

(16)

where ncut is empirically chosen to be ncut = 6 (see also Bai et al. 2015). If the particle energy spectrum takes the

form dN/dγ ∝ γ−s exp(−γ/γcut) with power-law slope s and exponential cutoﬀ at γcut, then our deﬁnition yields
γmax ∼ (ncut − s) γcut.

As the collapse proceeds beyond ct/L ∼ 1, the system approaches a self-similar evolution, as we have already
emphasized for our force-free simulations (see Fig. 9). As shown in Fig. 13, the X-point evolves into a thin current
sheet with two Y-points at its ends. The current sheet is supported by the pressure of the compressed guide ﬁeld (as
it is apparent in Fig. 13) and by the kinetic pressure of the accelerated particles. As illustrated in Fig. 13, the current
sheet is thinner for lower magnetizations, at ﬁxed L/ c/ωp (compare σL = 4 × 103 on the left and σL = 4 × 104 on the
right). Roughly, the thickness of the current sheet at this stage is set by the Larmor radius rL,hot = √σL c/ωp of the

high-energy particles heated/accelerated by reconnection, which explains the variation of the current sheet thickness
with σL in Fig. 13. A long thin current sheet is expected to fragment into a chain of plasmoids/magnetic islands (e.g.,
Uzdensky et al. 2010), when the length-to-thickness ratio is much larger than unity. At ﬁxed time (in units of L/c), so
at ﬁxed sheet length, it is then more likely that the fragmentation into plasmoids appears at lower magnetizations, since
a lower σL results in a thinner current sheet. This is in agreement with Fig. 13, and we have further checked that the
current sheet in the simulation with σL = 4 × 102 starts fragmenting at even earlier times.

In the small-scale X-points in between the self-generated plasmoids, the electric ﬁeld can approach and exceed the
magnetic ﬁeld. This is apparent in Fig. 14 — referring to the same simulations as in Fig. 13 — where we show the value
of 1− E2/B2, which quantiﬁes the strength of the electric ﬁeld relative to the magnetic ﬁeld. In the case of σL = 4× 103
(left side), the microscopic regions in between the plasmoids are characterized by E > B (see, e.g., at the center of
panel (d)). In addition, ahead of each of the two Y-points, a bow-shaped area exists where E ∼ B (e.g., at |x| ∼ 5L
and y ∼ 0 in panel (c)). The two Y-points move at the Alfv´en speed, which is comparable to the speed of light for our
σL (cid:29) 1 plasma. So, the fact that E ∼ B ahead of the Y-points is just a manifestation of the relativistic nature of the
reconnection outﬂows. For σL = 4 × 103 (left side in Fig. 14), the electric energy in the bulk of the inﬂow region is
much smaller than the magnetic energy, corresponding to 1 − E2/B2 ∼ 0.6. Or equivalently, the reconnection speed is
signiﬁcantly smaller than the speed of light. The highly relativistic case of σL = 4 × 104 (right panel in Fig. 14) shows
a diﬀerent picture. Here, a large volume with E ∼ B develops in the inﬂow region. In other words, the reconnection
speed approaches the speed of light in a macroscopic region. In the next subsection, we will show that an inﬂow speed
near the speed of light (or equivalently, E ∼ B) is a generic by-product of high-σL reconnection.9

9In retrospect, the fact that this conclusion also holds for the case of guide-ﬁeld X-point collapse is not surprising. At the initial time,
only the region within a radius (cid:46) L from the current sheet has a guide ﬁeld stronger than the in-plane ﬁelds. This implies that at late times,

simulations, that implicitly constrain E ≤ B). This ﬁgure corresponds to the right side of Fig. 9, which shows the
results of force-free simulations.

4.2.3. Stressed X-point collapse without guide ﬁeld

Figure 15 shows the initial phase (ct/L ≤ 1) of the collapse of a solitary X-point in PIC simulations with λ = 1/√2
and with zero guide ﬁeld, for two diﬀerent magnetizations: σL = 4 × 103 (left) and σL = 4 × 104 (right). We plot the
quantity 1 − E2/B2 (more precisely, we present max[0, 1 − E2/B2]), in order to identify the regions where the electric
ﬁeld is comparable to the magnetic ﬁeld (green or blue areas in the plot). For both σL = 4× 103 (left) and σL = 4× 104
(right), the current sheet is subject to copious fragmentation into plasmoids since early times, in contrast with the
guide-ﬁeld case (compare with Fig. 10). There, the current sheet was supported by the pressure of the compressed guide
ﬁeld, and therefore its thickness was larger, making it less prone to fragmentation (at a ﬁxed time ct/L). In addition, a
comparison of Fig. 15, which refers to early times (up to ct/L = 1), with Fig. 16, that follows the system up to ct/L = 6,
shows the remarkable self-similarity of the evolution, for both magnetizations. As the current sheet stretches longer,
the two bow-shaped heads propagating outward become larger (with a typical size along y that is always comparable to
the half-length of the reconnection layer). At the same time, the size of the largest plasmoids generated in the current
sheet is always a ﬁxed fraction (∼ 0.1) of the overall length of the layer.

In Figs. 15 and 16, the plasmoids generated by the secondary tearing instability (Uzdensky et al. 2010) appear as
yellow structures, i.e., with magnetic energy much larger than the electric energy. In contrast, the region in between
each pair of plasmoids harbors an X-point, where the electric ﬁeld can exceed the magnetic ﬁeld. The typical size of
such X-points is much smaller than the overall length of the system (and consequently, of the size of the initial collapsing

when regions initially at a distance (cid:38) L are eventually advected to the center, the guide ﬁeld at the current sheet will be sub-dominant with
respect to the in-plane ﬁelds, so that the results of guide-ﬁeld reconnection will resemble the case of a vanishing guide ﬁeld.

X-point). Yet, the X-points in the current layer play a major role for particle injection into the acceleration process, as
we argue in the next subsection.

As observed in the case of guide-ﬁeld collapse, the two bow-shaped regions ahead of the Y-points (to the left and
to the right of the reconnection layer) are moving relativistically, yielding E ∼ B (green and blue colors in the ﬁgures).
In addition, in the high-magnetization case σL = 4× 104 (right side of Figs. 15 and 16), a macroscopic region appears in
the bulk inﬂow where the electric ﬁeld is comparable to the magnetic ﬁeld. Here, the inﬂow rate approaches the speed
of light, as we have already described in the case of guide-ﬁeld reconnection (right side of Fig. 14).

This is further illustrated in Fig. 17, where we present the temporal evolution of various quantities, from a suite
of PIC simulations of X-point collapse with vanishing guide ﬁeld, having three diﬀerent magnetizations: σL = 4 × 102
(blue), σL = 4× 103 (green) and σL = 4× 104 (red). The reconnection rate vrec/c (panel (b)), which is measured as the
inﬂow speed averaged over a macroscopic square of side equal to L centered at x = y = 0, shows in the asymptotic state
(i.e., at ct/L (cid:38) 0.5) a clear dependence on σL, reaching vrec/c ∼ 0.8 for our high-magnetization case σL = 4× 104 (red).

This trend has already been described by Liu et al. (2015). The critical diﬀerence, though, is that their measurement

– 30 –

was performed on microscopic skin-depth scales, whereas our results show that reconnection velocities near the speed
of light can be achieved over macroscopic scales L (cid:29) c/ωp. In addition, such inﬂow speed is signiﬁcantly larger than
what is measured on macroscopic scales in the case of plane-parallel steady-state reconnection, where the reconnection
rate typically approaches vrec/c ∼ 0.2 in the high-magnetization limit (Sironi & Spitkovsky 2014; Guo et al. 2015).

The dependence of the reconnection speed on σL is also revealed in Fig. 17(a), where we present the temporal
evolution of the electric ﬁeld E(t) measured at (x, y) = (−0.1L, 0.1L), in units of the initial magnetic ﬁeld at x = L.
The variation in slope in Fig. 17(a) is indeed driven by the diﬀerent reconnection speeds, since E ∼ vrecB/c in the inﬂow
region. Interestingly, the electric ﬁeld increases linearly with time. This is ultimately a result of the linear increase of
the initial magnetic ﬁeld with distance from the center. Assuming a constant reconnection speed, as time progresses
the plasma that is now advected into the current sheet was initially located farther and farther away. The plasma
carries its frozen-in magnetic ﬁeld, which is then linearly increasing over time. From E ∼ vrecB/c and taking a constant
reconnection rate, this explains the linear increase of the electric ﬁeld.

The temporal evolution of the electric ﬁeld has a direct impact on the maximum particle energy, which is shown in

Fig. 17(c). Quite generally, its time evolution will be

γmaxmc2 ∼ eEct ∼ evrecBt

(17)

Since both E and B in the reconnection region are scaling linearly with time (see Fig. 17(a)), one expects γmax ∝ t2,
as indeed conﬁrmed by the inset of panel (c) (compare with the dashed black line). This scaling is faster than in plane-
parallel steady-state reconnection, where E(t) is constant in time, leading to γmax ∝ t. From the scaling in Eq. (17),
one can understand the diﬀerent normalizations of the curves in Fig. 17(c). At a given time t, the magnetic ﬁeld B(t)
that is now present in the central region was initially at a distance ∼ vrect, if we assume a constant reconnection rate.
Due to the linear increase of the initial magnetic ﬁeld with distance from the center, we ﬁnd that B(t) ∝ √σLvrect. This

particles to an energy that is ∼ 30 times larger than for σL = 4 × 102, as a result of both the variation in σL and in the
reconnection speed. This is in excellent agreement with the curves in Fig. 17(c) (compare blue and red).

4.2.4. Particle acceleration and emission signatures

In this section, we explore the physics of particle acceleration in a stressed X-point collapse with vanishing guide
ﬁeld and σL = 4× 102, and we present the resulting particle distribution and synchrotron emission spectrum. In Fig. 18,
we follow the trajectories of a number of particles, selected such that their Lorentz factor exceeds a given threshold
γ0 = 30 within the time interval 1.4 ≤ ct0/L ≤ 1.7, as indicated by the vertical dashed lines in the top panel. The
temporal evolution of the Lorentz factor of such particles, presented in the top panel for the 30 positrons reaching the
highest energies, follows the track γ ∝ t2−t2
0 that is expected from dγ/dt ∝ E(t) ∝ t. Here, t0 is the injection time, when
γ ﬁrst exceeds the threshold γ0. The individual histories of single positrons might diﬀer substantially, but overall the top
panel of Fig. 18 suggests that the acceleration process is dominated by direct acceleration by the reconnection electric
ﬁeld, as indeed it is expected for our conﬁguration of a large-scale stressed X-point (see Sironi & Spitkovsky 2014; Guo
et al. 2015; Nalewajko et al. 2015, for a discussion of acceleration mechanisms in plane-parallel reconnection). We ﬁnd
that the particles presented in the top panel of Fig. 18 are too energetic to be conﬁned within the small-scale plasmoids
in the current sheet, so any acceleration mechanism that relies on plasmoid mergers is found to be unimportant, in our
setup.

Particle injection into the acceleration process happens in the charge-starved regions where E > B, i.e., in the
small-scale X-points that separate each pair of secondary plasmoids in the current sheet. Indeed, for the same particles

within a given time interval (chosen to be 1.4 ≤ ct0/L ≤ 1.7, as indicated by the vertical dashed lines), and we plot the
temporal evolution of the Lorentz factor of the 30 particles that at the ﬁnal time reach the highest energies. The particle
Lorentz factor increases as γ ∝ t2 − t2

γ0). Middle panel: for the same particles as in the top panel, we plot their locations at the onset of acceleration with
open white circles, superimposed over the 2D plot of 1 − E2/B2 (more precisely, of max[0, 1 − E2/B2]). Comparison of
the middle panel with the bottom panel shows that particle injection is localized in the vicinity of the X-points in the
current sheet (i.e., the blue regions where E > B).

as in the top panel, the middle panel in Fig. 18 presents their locations at the onset of acceleration with open white
circles, superimposed over the 2D plot of 1 − E2/B2 (more precisely, of max[0, 1 − E2/B2]). Comparison of the middle
panel with the bottom panel shows that particle injection is localized in the vicinity of the small-scale X-points in the
current sheet (i.e., the blue regions where E > B). Despite occupying a small fraction of the overall volume, such regions
are of paramount importance for particle acceleration.

spectrum is γdN/dγ ∝ const. This is much harder than the dotted line, which indicates the slope νLν ∝ ν1/2 resulting
from an electron spectrum γdN/dγ ∝ γ−1 (dotted line in the top panel).

at the high-energy end.

from PIC simulations of relativistic plane-parallel reconnection (Sironi & Spitkovsky 2014; Guo et al. 2015; Werner
et al. 2016). Due to energy conservation, such hard slopes would not allow the spectrum to extend much beyond the
instantaneous value of the magnetization at the current sheet (as we have explained before, in our setup the magnetization
at the current sheet increases quadratically with time, since B(t) ∝ t), in line with the arguments of Sironi & Spitkovsky
(2014) and Werner et al. (2016).

The particle distribution is signiﬁcantly anisotropic. In the top panel of Fig. 20, we plot the electron momentum
spectrum at the ﬁnal time along diﬀerent directions, as indicated in the legend. The highest energy electrons are
beamed along the direction x of the reconnection outﬂow (blue lines) and along the direction −z of the accelerating
electric ﬁeld (red dashed line; positrons will be beamed along +z, due to the opposite charge). This is consistent with
earlier PIC simulations of plane-parallel reconnection in a small computational box, where the X-point acceleration
phase was still appreciably imprinting the resulting particle anisotropy (Cerutti et al. 2012c, 2013, 2014b; Kagan et al.
2016). In contrast, plane-parallel reconnection in larger computational domains generally leads to quasi-isotropic particle
distributions (Sironi & Spitkovsky 2014). In our setup of a large-scale X-point, we would expect the same level of strong
anisotropy measured in small-scale X-points of plane-parallel reconnection, as indeed demonstrated in the top panel of
Fig. 20. Most of the anisotropy is to be attributed to the “kinetic beaming” discussed by Cerutti et al. (2012c), rather
than beaming associated with the bulk motion (which is only marginally relativistic, see the inset in the top panel of
Fig. 20).

The angle-averaged synchrotron spectrum expected from a relativistic X-point collapse is shown in the bottom
panel of Fig. 19. For each macro-particle in our PIC simulation, we compute the instantaneous radius of curvature and
the corresponding synchrotron emission spectrum. We neglect synchrotron cooling in the particle equations of motion
(unlike Cerutti et al. 2013, 2014b; Kagan et al. 2016), and we do not consider the eﬀect of synchrotron self-absorption and
the Razin suppression at low frequencies. At late times, the synchrotron spectrum approaches a power law with νLν ∝ ν,
which just follows from the fact that the electron spectrum is γdN/dγ ∝ const. This is consistent with the spectrum
of the Crab ﬂares. The frequency on the horizontal axis is in units of νB,0 = √σLωp/2π. Given the maximum particle
energy in the top panel, γmax ∼ 104, one would expect the synchrotron spectrum to cut oﬀ at νmax ∼ γ2
maxνB,0 ∼ 108νB,0,
as indeed conﬁrmed in the bottom panel. The bottom panel of Fig. 20 shows the synchrotron spectrum at the ﬁnal
time along diﬀerent directions (within a solid angle of ∆Ω/4π ∼ 3 × 10−3), as indicated in the legend. The resulting
anisotropy of the synchrotron emission is consistent with the particle anisotropy illustrated in the top panel of Fig. 20.
In addition, one can see that the resulting synchrotron spectrum along the direction −z of the accelerating electric ﬁeld
(dashed red line) appears even harder than the spectrum along x or y.

5. Magnetic island merger in highly magnetized plasma - analytical considerations

Numerical simulations described above clearly show two stages of magnetic island merger - fast explosive stage and
subsequent slower evolution. For intermediate times, the ﬂux tubes show oscillations about some equilibrium position.
Let us next construct an analytical model that captures the transition between the two stage. The fast explosive stage is
driven by large scale stresses of the type “parallel currents attract”. As an initial unstable conﬁguration let us consider
X-point conﬁguration of two attracting line currents (Green 1965)

This balances the attractive force between the currents for L = a0. Thus, attraction of parallel currents created a current
sheet with the surface current ﬂowing in the opposite direction; the repulsive force between each current and the current
sheet balances exactly the attractive force between the currents. Evolution of the resulting equilibrium conﬁguration
will proceed on resistive time scales on the central current sheet.

We can also build a simple dynamic model of the current merger. Let us approximate the eﬀective electromagnetic

mass per unit length of a current-tube as

2πrdr = (I0/c)2 ln a0/amin

Thus, mef f is nearly constant. Let us next relate the current sheet length L to the island separation l assuming that
for distance 2l < 2a0 (2a0 is the initial separation)

Thus, the motion of the ﬂux tubes obeys

with initial conditions l(0) = a0 and l(cid:48)(0) = 0. Solution l(t) shows oscillations with equilibrium value l = a0/√2,
minimal value lmin = 0.45, period of oscillations is 4.39a0/c. For small times t (cid:28) a0√c/I,

l − 2

For a distributed current, ln a0/amin ∼ few. Thus, the ﬂux tubes oscillate around the equilibrium conﬁguration, as the
numerical simulations demonstrate.

Next, let us estimate the resulting electric ﬁeld and the electric potential during the initial nearly ideal stage of
oscillations. Given the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld described above, we can ﬁnd a typical electric ﬁeld (by integrating
∂tB + curl E = 0). We ﬁnd at the point x = y = 0

Thus, the electric ﬁeld instantaneously becomes of the order of the magnetic ﬁeld; at the point x = 0, y = 0,

(value of magnetic ﬁeld at the point x = 0, y = 0 also increases linearly with time).

The model presented above explains the two stages of the island merger observed in numerical simulations. Initially,
the merger is driven by the attraction of parallel currents. This stage of the instability is very fast, proceeding on
dynamical (Alfv´en ) time scale. After the perturbation reaches non-linear stage, it takes about one dynamical time scale
to reach a new equilibrium consisting of two attracting current tubes and a repulsive current sheet in between. During
the initial stage electric ﬁelds of the order of the magnetic ﬁelds develop. After the system reaches a new equilibrium
the ensuing evolution proceeds on slower time-scales that depend on plasma resistivity.

6. Collapse of a system of magnetic islands

6.1.

2D magnetic ABC structures

In this section we consider large scale dynamics that can lead to the X-point collapse described above. As an initial

pre-ﬂare state of plasma we consider a 2D force-fee lattice of magnetic ﬂux tubes

Bx = − sin(2παy)B0 ,
By = sin(2παx)B0 ,
Bz = (cos(2παx) + cos(2παy)) B0 ,

(29)

Fig. 22. This constitutes a lattice of force-free magnetic islands separated by 90o X-points in equilibrium. Islands have
alternating out-of-the-plane poloidal ﬁelds and alternating toroidal ﬁelds. Each magnetic ﬂux tube carries a magnetic
0 /(α3) and axial current ∝ B0/(α). Helicity
ﬂux ∝ B0/α2, energy per unit length ∝ B2
of both types of ﬂux tubes is of the same sign.

0 /α2, helicity per unit length ∝ B2

Previously, this conﬁguration has been considered by Parker (1983) in the context of Solar magnetic ﬁelds; he
suggested that this force-free conﬁguration is unstable. Later Longcope & Strauss (1994) considered the evolution of
the instability.
In case of force-free plasma the instability has been recently considered by East et al. (2015). The
conﬁguration (29) belong to a family of ABC ﬂows (Arnold-Beltrami-Childress, e.g., Roberts 1972). ABC magnetic
structures are known to be stable to ideal perturbations Arnold (1974); Molodensky (1974); Moﬀatt (1986) provided
that all three corresponding coeﬃcients are non-zero. Two-dimensional structures considered here do not satisfy this
condition - in this case the islands can move with respect to each other, reducing their interaction energy, as we show
below. The stable full 3D ABC structures do not allow for such motion. Full 3D ABC structures have all ﬁelds linked,
while in case of 2D the neighboring cylinders are not linked together. The diﬀerence between stable 3D and unstable
2D ABC conﬁgurations illustrates a general principle that lower dimension magnetic structures are typically less stable.

We foresee that the conﬁguration (29) is created by large scale turbulent processes described in §2.1, and not through
slow evolution from smaller scales, via, e.g., an inverse cascade-type process (Zrake 2014) - such cascade is expected to
be highly dissipative, see Appendix C.

6.2. The nature of the instability

The instability of the 2D ABC conﬁguration is of the kind “parallel currents attract”. In the initial conﬁguration
the attraction of parallel currents is balanced by the repulsion of anti-parallel ones. Small amplitude ﬂuctuations lead to
ﬂuctuating forces between the currents, that eventually lead to the disruption of the system. To identify the dominant
instability mode let us consider a simpliﬁed model problem replacing each island by a solid tube carrying a given current.
Such incompressible-type approximation is expected to be valid at early times, when the resulting motions are slow and
the amount of the dissipated magnetic energy is small.

We identify two basic instability modes which we call the shear mode and the compression mode. Let us ﬁrst
consider a global shear mode, Fig. 23. Let us separate the 2D ABC equilibrium into a set of columns, labeled 1-2-3,
Fig. 23. In the initial state the ﬂux tubes in the columns 1 and 3 (dashed lines) are horizontally aligned with those
in column 2. Let us shift columns 1 and 3 by a value −dy (or, equivalently, shift the column 2 by +dy; corresponding
horizontal displacement is dx = ±dy2/2. Let us consider forces on the central island (labeled by 0 in Fig. 23). The
interaction of the central island with island 4 and 8 produces a force in the positive y direction Fy,4 + Fy,8 ∝ dy/2. The
sum of forces Fy,1 + Fy,3 + Fy,5 + Fy,7 ∝ dy/2 also produces a force in the positive vertical direction. From the symmetry

Fig. 22.— A 2D force-free system of magnetic islands (magnetic ABC structures). Color indicates out-of-the-plane
magnetic ﬁeld. Both types of islands have the same helicity. At the X-point the magnetic ﬁeld and current are exactly
zero.

of the problem it is clear that the sum of all the forces from all the islands produce a net force in the positive vertical
direction - this ampliﬁes the perturbations, leading to instability.

We can also compare directly the corresponding interaction energies of the two states pictured in Fig. 23. Let us
approximate each ﬂux tube as a line current I. Up to insigniﬁcant overall factor the interaction energy of two currents
is ∝ I1I2 log r12 where r12 is the distance between the two currents. Consider an arbitrary ﬂux tube. It’s interaction
with ﬂux tubes located in the even row from a given one are the same in two cases. In the second case the interaction
with ﬂux tubes located in the odd rows is zero by symmetry, while in the initial state it is

(cid:88)

n=0

Eodd =

n2 + (2m + 1)2,

(30)

(here 2m + 1, m = 0, 1, 2... is the number of a row from a given island, n = 0, 1, 2... is the number of the islands in a
row from a given islands). This sum (30) is positive: the interaction energy with the n = 0 island is always positive,
∝ ln((2m + 1)r0); the sum over nth and n + 1 islands is also positive, ∝ ln((n + 1)2 + (2m + 1)2)/(n2 + (2m + 1)2) > 0.
Thus, the energy of the second state in Fig. 23 is lower - this is the driver of the instability.

There is another instability mode that we identiﬁed, Fig. 24.

Instead of coherent shift of the rows/columns it
involve local re-arrangement of two pairs of ﬂux tubes, Fig. 24. This conﬁguration has a lower energy than the initial
state: the forces of interaction of each touching pair of currents with all other touching pairs of currents is zero by
symmetry. Thus, what is important is the change in the energy for each two pairs of currents, left panel. It is negative

and is ∝ − ln(2/√3).

This simple model problem demonstrates semi-qualitatively the exponentially growing instability of a system of

magnetic islands. The instability initially is ideal and proceeds on the dynamical time scale of an island, so that
perturbations grow to non-linear stage in few dynamical time scales.

The above analytical considerations are clearly conﬁrmed by numerical experiments as we discuss next.

2D ABC instability: evolution in the force-free regime

6.3.1. Force-free simulations

Force-free simulations were carried out in a square domain of size [−L, L] × [−L, L] with 400 grid cells in each
direction. Periodic boundary conditions were imposed on all boundaries. Four models with diﬀerent magnetic Reynolds
numbers Rem = 4πκ(cid:107)L/c were investigated. Fig. 26 shows the evolution of the parameter 1 − E2/B2, which is a
Lorentz-invariant measure of the relative electric ﬁeld strength, for the model with Rem = 103. Until t = 7 this
parameter remains very close to zero throughout the whole domain, indicating absence of current sheets and rapid
motion in the bulk. Around t = 7, thin current sheets become visible in between magnetic islands (see the top-left
panel of Fig. 26). After this time the evolution proceeds rapidly - small islands merge to form larger ones until only
two islands remain as one can also see in Fig. 27, which shows the evolution of Bz. Models with higher Rem show very
similar evolution, with almost the same time for the onset of mergers and the same rate of magnetic dissipation after
that. Fig. 28 shows the evolution of the total electromagnetic energy in the box. One can see that for t < 7, the energy
signiﬁcantly decreases in models with Rem = 103 and Rem = 2 × 103 due to the Ohmic dissipation, whereas it remains
more or less unchanged in the models with Rem > 5 × 103. The ﬁrst “knee” on each curve corresponds to the onset of
the ﬁrst wave of merges. At t > 7 the magnetic dissipation rate no longer depends on Rem. The characteristic time
scale of the process is very short – only few light-crossings of the box.

Overall, the numerical results agree with our theoretical analysis (§s 6-5). The fact that the onset of mergers does
not depend on Rem supports the conclusion that the evolution starts as an ideal instability, driven by the large-scale
magnetic stresses. This instability leads to the relative motion of ﬂux tubes and development of stressed X-points, with
highly unbalanced magnetic tension. They collapse and form current sheets (see Fig. 25).

Until t ≤ 7 the instability develops in the linear regime and the initial periodic structure is still well preserved.
At the non-linear stage, at t ≥ 7, two new important eﬀects come into play. Firstly, the magnetic reconnection leads
to the emergence of closed magnetic ﬁeld lines around two or more magnetic islands of similar polarity (see Fig. 28).
Once formed, the common magnetic shroud pushes the islands towards the reconnection region in between via magnetic
tension. Thus, this regime can be called a forced reconnection. As the reconnection proceeds, more common magnetic
ﬁeld lines develop, increasing the driving force. Secondly, the current of the current sheet separating the merging islands
becomes suﬃciently large to slow down the merger via providing a repulsive force (§5). Hence, the reconnection rate is
determined both by the resisitivity of the current sheet and the overall magnetic tension of common ﬁeld lines.

We have studied the same problem using PIC simulations of highly-magnetized plasma and their results are strikingly
similar (compare Figs. 25-26-27 with Figs. 34-33). Not only they exhibit the same phases of evolution, but also very
similar timescales. This shows that the details of microphysics are not important and the key role is played by the
large-scale magnetic stresses.

2D ABC instability: PIC simulations

We study the evolution of 2D ABC structures with PIC simulations, employing the electromagnetic PIC code
TRISTAN-MP (Buneman 1993; Spitkovsky 2005). To the best of our knowledge, our investigation is the ﬁrst to address
with PIC simulations the dynamics and particle acceleration of high-magnetization ABC structures.

Our computational domain is a square in the x− y plane with periodic boundary conditions in both directions. The
simulation box is initialized with a uniform density of electron-positron plasma at rest, a vanishing electric ﬁeld and
with the magnetic ﬁeld appropriate for the 2D ABC conﬁguration, as described in Eq. 29. In addition to the unstressed
geometry in Eq. 29, we also investigate the case of 2D magnetic structures with an initial stress, or with an initial
velocity shear, as we specify below.

For our ﬁducial runs, the spatial resolution is such that the plasma skin depth c/ωp is resolved with 2.5 cells, but
we have veriﬁed that our results are the same up to a resolution of c/ωp = 10 cells. Since we investigate the case of

both cold and hot background plasmas, our deﬁnition of the skin depth is c/ωp =(cid:112)

mc2[1 + (ˆγ − 1)−1kT /mc2]/4πne2,

where ˆγ is the adiabatic index. Each cell is initialized with two positrons and two electrons, but we have checked that
our results are the same when using up to 16 particles per cell. In order to reduce noise in the simulation, we ﬁlter the
electric current deposited onto the grid by the particles, mimicking the eﬀect of a larger number of particles per cell
(Spitkovsky 2005; Belyaev 2015).

Our unit of length is the diameter L of the ABC structures, and time is measured in units of L/c. Typically, our
domain is a square of side 2L, but we have investigated also rectangular domains with size 2L × L, and large square
domains with dimensions 4L× 4L. In addition to the shape of the domain, we also vary the ﬂow parameters, such as the
temperature of the background plasma (kT /mc2 = 10−4, 10 and 102) and the ﬂow magnetization. The general deﬁnition
of the magnetization is σ = B2/4πw, where w = nmc2 + ˆγp/(ˆγ− 1); here, w is the enthalpy, p is the pressure and ˆγ is the
adiabatic index. In the following, we identify our runs via the mean value σin of the magnetization measured with the
in-plane ﬁelds (so, excluding the Bz ﬁeld). As we argue below, it is the dissipation of the in-plane ﬁelds that primarily
drives eﬃcient heating and particle acceleration. The mean in-plane ﬁeld corresponding to σin shall be called B0,in, and
it will be our unit of measure of the electromagnetic ﬁelds. For the 2D ABC geometry, B0,in is equal to the ﬁeld B0 in
Eq. 29. We will explore a wide range of magnetizations, from σin = 3 up to σin = 680. The mean magnetization of the
system, including all the magnetic ﬁeld components, is 2σin.

It will be convenient to compare the diameter L of ABC structures to the characteristic Larmor radius rL,hot =
√σin c/ωp of the high-energy particles heated/accelerated by reconnection (rather than to the skin depth c/ωp). We
will explore a wide range of L/rL,hot, from L/rL,hot = 31 up to 502. We will demonstrate that the two most fundamental
parameters that characterize a system of 2D ABC structures are the magnetization σin and the ratio L/rL,hot.

6.4.1. The instability of 2D ABC structures

Figure 29 illustrates the instability of a typical 2D ABC structure. The plot presents the 2D pattern of the out-of-
plane ﬁeld Bz (in units of B0,in) from a PIC simulation with kT /mc2 = 102, σin = 42 and L = 126 rL,hot, performed
within a large square domain of size 4L × 4L. Time is measured in units of L/c and indicated in the grey boxes within
each panel. The system does not show any evidence of evolution until ct/L ∼ 4. This is also conﬁrmed by the temporal
tracks shown in Fig. 30, where the top panel presents the energy partition among diﬀerent components. Until ct/L ∼ 4,
all the energy is still in the magnetic ﬁeld (solid blue line), and the state of the system is identical to the initial setup.

Quite abruptly, at ct/L ∼ 5 (top right panel in Fig. 29), the system becomes unstable. The pattern of magnetic
islands shifts along the oblique direction, in analogy to the mode illustrated in Fig. 23. In agreement with the ﬂuid

kT /mc2 = 102, σin = 42 and L = 126 rL,hot, performed within a large square domain of size 4L × 4L. The system stays
unperturbed until ct/L (cid:39) 4, then it goes unstable via the oblique mode presented in Fig. 23. The instability leads to the
formation of current sheets of length ∼ L (at ct/L = 6), and to the merger of islands with Bz ﬁelds of the same polarity.
At the ﬁnal time, the box is divided into two regions with Bz ﬁelds of opposite polarity. This should be compared with
the force-free results in Fig. 27.

Top panel: fraction of energy in magnetic ﬁelds (solid blue), in-plane magnetic ﬁelds (dashed blue, with B,in = B/2

ct/L (cid:39) 5 is accompanied by little ﬁeld dissipation (kin/tot(0) ∼ 0.1) but dramatic particle acceleration. In both panels,
the vertical dotted black line indicates the time when the electric energy peaks, which happens shortly before the end
of the most violent phase of instability.

– 49 –

simulations presented by East et al. (2015), our PIC results conﬁrm that this is an ideal instability. The onset time is
comparable to what is observed in force-free simulations (see Fig. 28) and it does not appreciably depend on numerical
parameters (so, on the level of numerical noise).
In particular, we ﬁnd no evidence for an earlier onset time when
degrading our numerical resolution (spatial resolution or number of particles per cell). As we show below, the onset time
at ct/L ∼ 5 is also remarkably independent of physical parameters, with only a moderate trend for later onset times at
larger values of L/rL,hot. We have also investigated the dependence of the onset time on the number of ABC islands in
the computational domain (or equivalently, on the box size in units of L). We ﬁnd that square domains with 2L× 2L or
4L × 4L yield similar onset times, whereas the instability is systematically delayed (by a few L/c) in rectangular boxes
with 2L × L, probably because this reduces the number of modes that can go unstable (in fact, we have veriﬁed that
ABC structures in a periodic square box of size L × L are stable).

Following the instability onset, the evolution of the system proceeds on the dynamical time. Within a few L/c,
as they drift along the oblique direction, neighboring islands with the same Bz polarity come into contact (middle left
panel in Fig. 29 at ct/L = 6), the X-points in between each pair of islands collapse under the eﬀect of large-scale stresses
(see Sect. 4.2), and thin current sheets are formed. For the parameters of Fig. 29, the resulting current sheets are so
long that they are unstable to the secondary tearing mode (Uzdensky et al. 2010), and secondary plasmoids are formed
(e.g., see the plasmoid at (x, y) = (−1.5L, L) at ct/L = 6). Below, we demonstrate that the formation of secondary
plasmoids is primarily controlled by the ratio L/rL,hot. At the X-points, the magnetic energy is converted into particle
energy by a reconnection electric ﬁeld of order ∼ 0.3Bin, where Bin is the in-plane ﬁeld (so, the reconnection rate is
vrec/c ∼ 0.3).11 As shown in the top panel of Fig. 30, it is primarily the in-plane ﬁeld that gets dissipated (compare the
dashed and solid blue lines), driving an increase in the electric energy (green) and in the particle kinetic energy (red).12
In this phase of evolution, the fraction of initial energy released to the particles is still small (kin/tot(0) ∼ 0.1), but
the particles advected into the X-points experience a dramatic episode of acceleration. As shown in the bottom panel
of Fig. 30, the cutoﬀ Lorentz factor γmax of the particle spectrum presents a dramatic evolution, increasing from the
thermal value γth (cid:39) 3kT /mc2 (here, kT /mc2 = 102) by a factor of 103 within a couple of dynamical times. It is this
phase of extremely fast particle acceleration that we associate with the generation of the Crab ﬂares.

Over one dynamical time, the current sheets in between neighboring islands stretch to their maximum length of
∼ L. This corresponds to the time when the electric energy peaks, which is indicated by the dotted black line in Fig. 30,
and it shortly precedes the end of the most violent phase of instability. The peak time of the electric energy will be a
useful reference point when comparing runs with diﬀerent physical parameters. The ﬁrst island merger event ends at
ct/L ∼ 7 with the coalescence of island cores. At later times, the system of magnetic islands will undergo additional
merger episodes (i.e., at ct/L ∼ 9 and 12), with the formation of current sheets and secondary plasmoids (see, e.g., at
(x, y) = (L,−1.5L) in the bottom left panel of Fig. 29), but the upper cutoﬀ of the particle spectrum will not change
by more than a factor of three (see the bottom panel in Fig. 30 at ct/L (cid:38) 6). As a consequence, the spectral cutoﬀ at
the ﬁnal time is not expected to be signiﬁcantly dependent on the number of lengths L in the computational domain,
as we have indeed veriﬁed. Rather than dramatic acceleration of a small number of “lucky” particles, the late phases
result in substantial heating of the bulk of the particles, as illustrated by the red line in the top panel of Fig. 30. As
a consequence of particle heating, the eﬀective magnetization of the plasma is only σin ∼ 1 after the initial merger
episode (compare the dashed blue and solid red lines at ct/L ∼ 9 and 12 in the top panel of Fig. 30), which explains why
additional island mergers do not lead to dramatic particle acceleration. The rate of dissipation of magnetic energy into

11This value of the reconnection rate is roughly comparable to the results of solitary X-point collapse presented in Sect. 4.2. However,
a direct comparison cannot be established, since in that case we either assumed a uniform nonzero guide ﬁeld or a vanishing guide ﬁeld.
Here, the X-point collapse starts in regions with zero guide ﬁeld. Yet, as reconnection proceeds, an out-of-plane ﬁeld of increasing strength
is advected into the current sheet.

12The out-of-plane ﬁeld does not dissipate because island mergers always happen between pairs of islands having the same Bz polarity.

particle energy at late times is roughly consistent with the results of force-free simulations (see Fig. 28). At late times,
the system saturates when only two regions are left in the box, having Bz ﬁelds of opposite polarity (bottom right panel
in Fig. 29). In the ﬁnal state, most of the in-plane magnetic energy has been trasferred to the particles (compare the
red and dashed blue lines in the top panel of Fig. 30).

In Fig. 34 we compare the development of the two modes of instability, the shearing and the compressive one.

6.4.2. Particle acceleration and emission signatures

The evolution of the particle spectrum in the top panel of Fig. 31 illustrates the acceleration capabilities of the
instability of ABC structures. Until ct/L ∼ 4, the particle spectrum does not show any sign of evolution, and it does not
deviate from the initial Maxwellian distribution peaking at γth (cid:39) 300. From ct/L ∼ 4 up to ct/L ∼ 8 (from purple to
light blue in the plot), the high-energy end of the particle spectrum undergoes a dramatic evolution, whereas the thermal
peak is still unaﬀected (so, only a small fraction of the particles are accelerated). This is the most dramatic phase of
particle acceleration, which we associate with the Crab ﬂares. At the end of this explosive phase, the high-energy tail of

the particle spectrum resembles a power law dN/dγ ∝ γ−s with a hard slope s ∼ 1.5. The angle-averaged synchrotron
spectrum (bottom panel in Fig. 31) parallels the extreme evolution of the particle spectrum, with the peak frequency
of νLν moving from the “thermal” value ∼ 108νB,in (dominated by the emission of thermal particles with γ ∼ γth) up
to ∼ 1013νB,in within just a few dynamical times. Here, we have deﬁned νB,in = √σinωp/2π.

The evolution at later times, during subsequent merger episodes, is at most moderate. From ct/L ∼ 8 up to the
ﬁnal time ct/L ∼ 20 (from light blue to red in the plot), the upper energy cutoﬀ of the particle spectrum only increases
by a factor of three, and the peak synchrotron frequency only by a factor of ten. The most signiﬁcant evolution of the
electron spectrum at such late times involves the thermal peak of the distribution, which shifts up in energy by a factor
of ∼ 10. This conﬁrms what we have anticipated above, i.e., that subsequent episodes of island mergers primarily result
in particle heating, rather than non-thermal acceleration. At the ﬁnal time, the particle high-energy spectrum resembles
a power law γdN/dγ ∝ γ−1 (compare with the dotted black line in the top panel) and, consequently, the angle-averaged
synchrotron spectrum approaches νLν ∝ ν1/2 (compare with the dotted black line in the bottom panel).

The inset in the top panel of Fig. 31 shows the electron momentum distribution along diﬀerent directions (as
indicated in the legend), at the time when the electric energy peaks (as indicated by the dotted black line in Fig. 30).
The electron distribution is roughly isotropic. This might appear surprising, since at this time the particles are being
dramatically accelerated at the collapsing X-points in between neighboring islands, and in Sect. 4.2 we have demonstrated
that the particle distribution during X-point collapse is highly anisotropic. The accelerated electrons were beamed along
the reconnection outﬂow and in the direction opposite to the accelerating electric ﬁeld (while positrons were parallel
to the electric ﬁeld). Indeed, the particle distribution at each X-point in the collapsing ABC structure shows the same
anisotropy as for a solitary X-point.

The apparent isotropy in the inset of the top panel of Fig. 31 is a peculiar result of the ABC geometry. The middle
left panel in Fig. 29 shows that in the x − y plane the number of current sheets (and so, of reconnection outﬂows)
oriented along x is roughly comparable to those along y. So, no preferred direction for the electron momentum spectrum
is expected in the x − y plane. In addition, in 2D ABC structures the accelerating electric ﬁeld Ez has always the same
polarity as the local out-of-plane magnetic ﬁeld Bz (or equivalently, E · B > 0 at X-points, as we explicitly show in the
bottom panel in Fig. 33). In other words, current sheets that are colored in yellow in the middle left panel of Fig. 29 have
Ez > 0, whereas Ez < 0 in current sheets colored in blue. Since the two options occur in equal numbers, no diﬀerence
between the electron momentum spectrum in the +z versus −z direction is expected. Both the spatially-integrated
electron momentum distribution (inset in the top panel) and the resulting synchrotron emission (inset in the bottom

Figs. 32 and 33 describe the physics of particle acceleration during the instability of ABC structures. We consider
a representative simulation with kT /mc2 = 10−4, σin = 42 and L = 251 rL,hot, performed within a square domain of
size 2L × 2L. In the middle panel of Fig. 32, we present a 2D histogram of accelerated particles. On the vertical axis
we plot the ﬁnal particle Lorentz factor γend (measured at ct/L = 8.8), while the horizontal axis shows the particle
injection time ct0/L, when the particle Lorentz factor ﬁrst exceeded the threshold γ0 = 30 of our choice. The histogram
shows that the particles that eventually reach the highest energies are injected into the acceleration process around
6.5 ≤ ct0/L ≤ 6.8 (the two boundaries are indicated with vertical dashed black lines in the middle and bottom panels).
For our simulation, this interval corresponds to the most violent stage of ABC instability, and it shortly precedes the
time when the electric energy peaks (see the dotted green line in the top panel of Fig. 32) and the current sheets reach
their maximum length ∼ L.13 In order to reach the highest energies, the accelerated particles should sample the full
available potential of the current sheet, by exiting the reconnection layer when it reaches its maximal extent. Since they
move at the speed of light along the sheet half-length ∼ 0.5L, one can estimate that they should have been injected

13Even when we extend our time window up to ∼ 15L/c, including additional merger episodes, we still ﬁnd that the highest energy particles

are injected during the initial ABC collapse.

Among the particles injected within 6.5 ≤ ct0/L ≤ 6.8, the bottom panel in Fig. 32 shows the energy evolution of
the ten positrons that reach the highest energies. We observe two distinct phases: an initial stage of direct acceleration
by the reconnection electric ﬁeld (at 6.5 (cid:46) ct/L (cid:46) 7.3), followed by a phase of stochastic energy gains and losses (from
ct/L ∼ 7.3 up to the end). During the second stage, the pre-accelerated particles bounce oﬀ the wobbling/merging
magnetic islands, and they further increase their energy via a second-order Fermi process. At the time of injection, the
selected positrons were all localized in the vicinity of the collapsing X-points. This is shown in the top panel of Fig. 33,
where we plot with open white circles the location of the selected positrons at the time of injection, superimposed over
the 2D pattern of Bz at t ∼ 6.65L/c. In the current sheets resulting from X-point collapse the force-free condition

6.4.3. Dependence on the ﬂow parameters

In this subsection, we explore the dependence of our results on the initial plasma temperature, the in-plane mag-

netization σin and the ratio L/rL,hot.

Figs. 35 and 36 describes the dependence of our results on the ﬂow temperature, for a suite of three simulations of
ABC collapse with ﬁxed σin = 42 and ﬁxed L/rL,hot = 251, but diﬀerent plasma temperatures: kT /mc2 = 10−4 (blue),
kT /mc2 = 10 (green) and kT /mc2 = 102 (red). The deﬁnitions of both the in-plane magnetization σin and the plasma
skin depth c/ωp (and so, also the Larmor radius rL,hot) account for the ﬂow temperature, as described above. With
this choice, Figs. 35 and 36 demonstrate that our results do not appreciably depend on the plasma temperature, apart
from an overall shift in the energy scale. In particular, in the relativistic regime kT /mc2 (cid:29) 1, our results for diﬀerent
temperatures are virtually undistinguishable. The onset of the ABC instability is nearly the same for the three values of
temperature we investigate (top panel in Fig. 35), the exponential growth is the same (with a rate equal to ∼ 4c/L for
the electric energy, compare with the dashed black line) and the peak time is quite similar (with a minor delay for the
non-relativistic case kT /mc2 = 10−4, in blue). At the onset of the ABC instability, the upper cutoﬀ γmax of the particle
energy spectrum grows explosively. Once normalized to the thermal value γth (cid:39) 1 + (ˆγ − 1)−1kT /mc2 (which equals
γth (cid:39) 1 for kT /mc2 (cid:28) 1 and γth (cid:39) 3kT /mc2 for kT /mc2 (cid:29) 1), the temporal evolution of γmax does not appreciably
depend on the initial temperature, especially in the relativistic regime kT /mc2 (cid:29) 1 (green and red lines).

particle Lorentz factor (bottom panel; γmax is deﬁned in Eq. (16), and it is normalized to the thermal Lorentz factor

(red). The dashed black line in the top panel shows that the electric energy grows exponentially as ∝ exp (4ct/L). The
vertical dotted lines mark the time when the electric energy peaks (colors correspond to the three values of kT /mc2, as
described above).

collapse with ﬁxed σin = 42 and ﬁxed L/rL,hot = 251, but diﬀerent plasma temperatures: kT /mc2 = 10−4 (blue),
kT /mc2 = 10 (green) and kT /mc2 = 102 (red). The main plot shows γdN/dγ to emphasize the particle content,
whereas the inset presents γ2dN/dγ to highlight the energy census. The dotted black line is a power law γdN/dγ ∝ γ−1,

corresponding to equal energy content per decade (which would result in a ﬂat distribution in the inset). The particle
Lorentz factor on the horizontal axis is normalized to the thermal value γth, to facilitate comparison among the three
cases.

– 57 –

Similar conclusions hold for the particle spectrum γdN/dγ at the time when the electric energy peaks, presented in
the main panel of Fig. 36. The spectra of kT /mc2 = 10 (green) and kT /mc2 = 102 (red) overlap, once the horizontal axis

is normalized to the thermal Lorentz factor γth. Their high-energy end approaches the slope γdN/dγ ∝ γ−1 indicated

with the dotted black line. This corresponds to a distribution with equal energy content per decade (which would
result in a ﬂat distribution in the inset, where we plot γ2dN/dγ to emphasize the energy census). The spectrum for
kT /mc2 = 10−4 (blue line) is marginally harder, but its high-energy part is remarkably similar.

We now investigate the dependence of our results on the magnetization σin and the ratio L/rL,hot, where rL,hot =
√σin c/ωp. In Fig. 37, we present the 2D pattern of the out-of-plane ﬁeld Bz (in units of B0,in) at the most violent time
of ABC instability (i.e., when the electric energy peaks, as indicated by the vertical dotted lines in Fig. 38) from a suite
of PIC simulations in a square domain 2L × 2L. In the left column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and σin = 42 and we vary
the ratio L/rL,hot, from 31 to 251 (from top to bottom). In the right column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 102 and L/rL,hot = 63
and we vary the magnetization σin, from 3 to 170 (from top to bottom). The ﬁgure shows that the instability proceeds
in a similar way in all the runs, even though some cases go unstable via the “parallel” mode depicted in Fig. 24 (e.g.,
see the top right panel) , others via the “oblique” mode described in Fig. 23 (e.g., see the bottom left panel). Here,
“parallel” and “oblique” refer to the orientation of the wavevector with respect to the axes of the box.

The evolution is remarkably similar, whether the instability proceeds via the parallel or the oblique mode. Yet,
some diﬀerences can be found: (i) In the oblique mode, all the null points are activated, i.e., they all evolve into a long
thin current sheet suitable for particle acceleration; in contrast, in the parallel mode only half of the null points are
activated (e.g., the null point at x = 0 and y = 0.5L in the top right panel does not form a current sheet, and we have
veriﬁed that it does not lead to signiﬁcant particle acceleration). Everything else being equal, this results in a diﬀerence
by a factor of two in the normalization of the high-energy tail of accelerated particles (i.e., the acceleration eﬃciency
diﬀers by a factor of two), as we have indeed veriﬁed. (ii) The current sheets of the parallel mode tend to stretch longer
than for the oblique mode (by roughly a factor of √2), resulting in a diﬀerence of a factor of √2 in the maximum particle
energy, everything else being the same. (iii) in the explosive phase of the instability, the oblique mode tends to dissipate
some fraction of the out-of-plane ﬁeld energy (still, a minor fraction as compared to the dissipated in-plane energy),
whereas the parallel mode does not. Regardless of such diﬀerences, both modes result in eﬃcient particle acceleration
and heating, and in a similar temporal evolution of the rate of magnetic energy dissipation (with the kinetic energy
fraction reaching kin/tot(0) ∼ 0.1 during the explosive phase, and eventually saturating at kin/tot(0) ∼ 0.5).

The 2D pattern of Bz shown in Fig. 37 shows a tendency for thinner current sheets at larger L/rL,hot, when ﬁxing
σin (left column in Fig. 37). Roughly, the thickness of the current sheet is set by the Larmor radius rL,hot of the
high-energy particles heated/accelerated by reconnection. In the right column, with L/rL,hot ﬁxed, the thickness of the
current sheet is then a ﬁxed fraction of the box size. In contrast, in the left column, the ratio of current sheet thickness
to box size will scale as rL,hot/L, as indeed it is observed. A long thin current sheet is expected to fragment into a chain
of plasmoids/magnetic islands (e.g., Uzdensky et al. 2010; Werner et al. 2016), when the length-to-thickness ratio is
much larger than unity.14 It follows that the cases in the right column will display a similar tendency for fragmentation
(and in particular, they do not appreciably fragment), whereas the likelihood of fragmentation is expected to increase
from top to bottom in the left column.
In fact, for the case with L/rL,hot = 251 (left bottom panel), a number of
small-scale plasmoids appear in the current sheets (e.g., see the plasmoid at x = 0 and y = −0.5L in the left bottom
panel). We ﬁnd that as long as σin (cid:29) 1, the secondary tearing mode discussed by Uzdensky et al. (2010) — that leads
to current sheet fragmentation — appears at L/rL,hot (cid:38) 200, in the case of ABC collapse.15 In addition to the runs

14The fact that the ratio of lengths most important for regulating the reconnection physics is L/rL,hot was already anticipated by P´etri &

Lyubarsky (2007a) and Sironi & Spitkovsky (2011a), in the context of striped pulsar winds.

15This holds for both kT /mc2 (cid:28) 1 and kT /mc2 (cid:29) 1, with only a minor evidence for the transition happening at slightly smaller L/rL,hot

quite similar, apart from the fact that larger L/rL,hot tend to lead to a more pronounced fragmentation of the current
sheet. Some cases go unstable via the “parallel” mode depicted in Fig. 24, others via the “oblique” mode described in
Fig. 23.

grows exponentially as ∝ exp (4ct/L). The vertical dotted lines mark the time when the electric energy peaks (colors as
described above).

census. The dotted black line is a power law γdN/dγ ∝ γ−1, corresponding to equal energy content per decade (which
would result in a ﬂat distribution in the insets). The spectral hardness is not a sensitive function of the ratio L/rL,hot,
but it is strongly dependent on σin, with higher magnetizations giving harder spectra, up to the saturation slope of −1.

presented in Fig. 37, we have conﬁrmed this result by covering the whole σin − L/rL,hot parameter space, with σin from
3 to 680 and with L/rL,hot from 31 to 502.

We have performed an additional test to check that the current sheet thickness scales as rL,hot. When the recon-
nection layers reach their maximal extent (i.e., at the peak of the electric energy), the current sheet length should scale
as L, whereas its thickness should be ∼ rL,hot. Since the current sheets are characterized by a ﬁeld-aligned electric ﬁeld
(see the bottom panel in Fig. 33), the fraction of box area occupied by regions with E · B (cid:54)= 0 should scale as rL,hot/L.
We have explicitly veriﬁed that this is indeed the case, both when comparing runs that have the same L/rL,hot and for
simulations that keep σin ﬁxed.

The reconnection rate in all the cases we have explored is around vrec/c ∼ 0.3−0.5. It shows a marginal tendency for
decreasing with increasing L/rL,hot (but we have veriﬁed that it saturates at vrec/c ∼ 0.3 in the limit L/rL,hot (cid:29) 1), and
it moderately increases with σin (especially as we transition from the non-relativistic regime to the relativistic regime,
but it saturates at vrec/c ∼ 0.5 in the limit σin (cid:29) 1). Our measurements of the inﬂow speed (which we take as a proxy
for the reconnection rate) are easier when the parallel mode dominates, since the inﬂow direction lies along one of the
Cartesian axes, rather than for the oblique mode. In simulations with an aspect ratio of 2L × L, the parallel mode is
the only one that gets triggered, and most of the measurements quoted above refer to this setup.

In Fig. 38 we present the temporal evolution of the runs whose 2D structure is shown in Fig. 37. In the left column,
we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and σin = 42 and we vary the ratio L/rL,hot from 31 to 251 (from blue to red). In the right
column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 102 and L/rL,hot = 63 and we vary the magnetization σin from 3 to 170 (from blue to red).
The top panels show that the evolution of the electric energy (in units of the total initial energy) is remarkably similar
for all the values of L/rL,hot and σin we explore. In particular, the electric energy grows as ∝ exp (4ct/L) in all the cases
(see the dashed black lines), and it peaks at ∼ 10% of the total initial energy. The only exception is the trans-relativistic
case σin = 3 and L/rL,hot = 63 (blue line in the top right panel), whose peak value is slightly smaller, due to the
lower Alfv´en speed. The onset time of the instability is also nearly independent of σin (top right panel), although the
trans-relativistic case σin = 3 (blue line) seems to be growing slightly later. As regard to the dependence of the onset
time on L/rL,hot at ﬁxed σin, the top left panel in Fig. 38 shows that larger values of L/rL,hot tend to grow later, but
the variation is only moderate: in all the cases the instability grows around ct/L ∼ 5.

In the early stages of ABC instability, the cutoﬀ Lorentz factor γmax of the particle energy spectrum (as deﬁned in
Eq. (16)) grows explosively (see the two bottom panels in Fig. 38). If the origin of time is set at the onset time of the
instability, the maximum energy is expected to grow as

γmaxmc2 ∼ evrecBint

(31)

Due to the approximate linear increase of the in-plane magnetic ﬁeld with distance from a null point, we ﬁnd that
Bin ∝ √σinvrect/L. This leads to γmax ∝ v2
rec√σint2/L, with the same quadratic temporal scaling that was discussed
for the solitary X-point collapse. Since the dynamical phase of ABC instability lasts a few L/c, the maximum particle
Lorentz factor at the end of this stage should scale as γmax ∝ v2
recσin(L/rL,hot). If the reconnection rate
does not signiﬁcantly depend on σin, this implies that γmax ∝ L at ﬁxed σin. The trend for an increasing γmax with L
at ﬁxed σin is conﬁrmed in the bottom left panel of Fig. 38, both at the ﬁnal time and at the peak time of the electric
energy (which is slightly diﬀerent among the four diﬀerent cases, see the vertical dotted colored lines).16 Similarly, if
the reconnection rate does not signiﬁcantly depend on L/rL,hot, this implies that γmax ∝ σin at ﬁxed L/rL,hot. This
linear dependence of γmax on σin is conﬁrmed in the bottom right panel of Fig. 38.

rec√σinL ∝ v2

in ultra-relativistic plasmas.

16In contrast, a comparison at the same ct/L is not very illuminating, since larger values of L/rL,hot tend to systematically have later

instability onset times.

– 62 –

The dependence of the particle spectrum on L/rL,hot and σin is illustrated in Fig. 39 (left and right panel, respec-
tively), where we present the particle energy distribution at the time when the electric energy peaks (as indicated by
the colored vertical dotted lines in Fig. 38). The particle spectrum shows a pronounced non-thermal component in all
the cases, regardless of whether the secondary plasmoid instability is triggered or not in the current sheets (the results
presented in Fig. 39 correspond to the cases displayed in Fig. 37). This suggests that in our setup any acceleration
mechanism that relies on plasmoid mergers is not very important, but rather that the dominant source of energy is
direct acceleration by the reconnection electric ﬁeld (see the previous subsection).

At the time when the electric energy peaks, most of the particles are still in the thermal component (at γ ∼ 1 in
the left panel and γ ∼ 3kT /mc2 in the right panel of Fig. 39), i.e., bulk heating is still negligible. Yet, a dramatic event
of particle acceleration is taking place, with a few lucky particles accelerated much beyond the mean energy per particle
∼ γthσin/2 (for comparison, we point out that γth ∼ 1 and σin = 42 for the cases in the left panel). Since most of the
particles are at the thermal peak, this is not violating energy conservation. As described by Sironi & Spitkovsky (2014)
and Werner et al. (2016), for a power law spectrum dN/dγ ∝ γ−p of index 1 < p < 2 extending from γ ∼ γth up to

γmax, the fact that the mean energy per particle is γthσin/2 yields a constraint on the upper cutoﬀ of the form

(cid:20) σin

γmax (cid:46) γth

(cid:21)1/(2−s)

(32)

This constraint does not apply during the explosive phase, since most of the particles lie at the thermal peak (so, the
distribution does not resemble a single power law), but it does apply at late times (e.g., see the ﬁnal spectrum in Fig. 31,
similar to a power law). However, as the bulk of the particles shift up to higher energies (see the evolution of the thermal
peak in Fig. 30), the spectrum at late times tends to be softer than in the early explosive phase (compare light blue and
red curves in Fig. 30), which helps relaxing the constraint in Eq. (32).

The spectra in Fig. 39 (main panels for γdN/dγ, to emphasize the particle content; insets for γ2dN/dγ, to highlight
the energy census) conﬁrm the trend of γmax anticipated above. At ﬁxed σin = 42 (left panel), we see that γmax ∝ L (L
changes by a factor of two in between each pair of curves);17 on the other hand, at ﬁxed L/rL,hot = 63 (right panel), we
ﬁnd that γmax ∝ σin (σin changes by a factor of four in between each pair of curves).

The spectral hardness is primarily controlled by the average in-plane magnetization σin. The right panel in Fig. 39
shows that at ﬁxed L/rL,hot the spectrum becomes systematically harder with increasing σin, approaching the asymptotic
shape γdN/dγ ∝ const found for plane-parallel steady-state reconnection in the limit of high magnetizations (Sironi &
Spitkovsky 2014; Guo et al. 2015; Werner et al. 2016). At large L/rL,hot, the hard spectrum of the high-σin cases will
necessarily run into constraints of energy conservation (see Eq. (32)), unless the pressure feedback of the accelerated
particles onto the ﬂow structure ultimately leads to a spectral softening (in analogy to the case of cosmic ray modiﬁed
shocks, see Amato & Blasi 2006). This argument seems to be supported by the left panel in Fig. 39. At ﬁxed σin (left
panel), the spectral slope is nearly insensitive to L/rL,hot. The only (marginal) evidence for a direct dependence on
L/rL,hot emerges at large L/rL,hot, with larger systems leading to steeper slopes (compare the yellow and red lines in
the left panel), which possibly reconciles the increase in γmax with the argument of energy conservation illustrated in
Eq. (32).

In application to the GeV ﬂares of the Crab Nebula, which we attribute to the explosive phase of ABC instability,

to smaller reconnection speeds (in units of the speed of light), and so weaker accelerating electric ﬁelds. On the other

we envision an optimal value of σin between ∼ 10 and ∼ 100. Based on our results, smaller σin (cid:46) 10 would correspond
hand, σin (cid:38) 100 would give hard spectra with slopes p < 2, which would prohibit particle acceleration up to γmax (cid:29) γth

17The fact that the dependence is a little shallower than linear is due to the fact that the reconnection rate, which enters in the full

expression γmax ∝ v2

recσin(L/rL,hot), is slightly decreasing with increasing L/rL,hot, as detailed above.

– 63 –

without violating energy conservation (for the sake of simplicity, here we ignore the potential spectral softening at high
σin and large L/rL,hot discussed above).

As we have mentioned above, we invoke the early phases of ABC collapse as an explanation for the Crab GeV
ﬂares. As shown in Fig. 31, after this initial stage the maximum particle energy is only increasing by a factor of three
(on long timescales, of order ∼ 10L/c). When properly accounting for the rapid synchrotron losses of the highest energy
particles (which our simulations do not take into account), it is even questionable whether the spectrum will ever evolve
to higher energies, after the initial collapse. This is the reason why we have focused most of our attention on how the
spectrum at the most violent time of ABC instability depends on L/rL,hot or σin. For the sake of completeness, we
now describe how the spectrum at late times (corresponding to the bottom right panel in Fig. 29) depends on the ﬂow
conditions. In analogy to what we have described above, the eﬀect of diﬀerent kT /mc2 is only to change the overall
energy scale, and the results are nearly insensitive to the ﬂow temperature, as long as c/ωp and σin properly account
for temperature eﬀects. The role of σin and L/rL,hot can be understood from the following simple argument (see also

Sironi & Spitkovsky 2011a). In the σin (cid:46) 10 − 100 cases in which the spectral slope is always p > 2 and the high-energy
spectral cutoﬀ is not constrained by energy conservation, we have argued that γmax/γth ∝ σin(L/rL,hot) (here, we have
neglected the dependence on the reconnection speed, for the sake of simplicity). As a result of bulk heating, the thermal
peak of the particle distribution shifts at late times — during the island mergers that follow the initial explosive phase
— from γth up to ∼ γthσin/2. By comparing the ﬁnal location of the thermal peak with γmax, one concludes that there
must be a critical value of L/rL,hot such that for small L/rL,hot the ﬁnal spectrum is close to a Maxwellian, whereas for
large values of L/rL,hot the non-thermal component established during the explosive phase is still visible at late times.
We have validated this argument with our results, ﬁnding that this critical threshold for the shape of the ﬁnal spectrum
is around L/rL,hot ∼ 100.

7. Driven evolution of a system of magnetic islands

As we have seen in §6, a periodic 2D ABC equilibrium conﬁguration of magnetic islands is unstable to merger. Such
equilibrium conﬁguration is naturally an idealized simpliﬁcation. As we demonstrate below, in the case of a modiﬁed
initial conﬁguration which is compressed along one direction the rapid island merger sets up straight away. What could
create such a stressed conﬁguration and promote rapid reconnection which may give rise to Crab’s gamma-ray ﬂares?
One possibility which comes to mind is a strong shock. Shocks in strongly magnetized relativistic plasma are often
described as weakly compressive and indeed in the shock frame the plasma density and the magnetic ﬁeld strength are
almost the same. However, when measured in the ﬂuid frame, these quantities may experience huge jumps, of the order
of the shock Mach number (Komissarov 2012). This is accompanied by similarly large variation of the ﬂow Lorentz
factor, which may also accelerate the rate of physical processes via the relativistic time dilation eﬀect. PIC simulations
of shocked striped wind by Sironi & Spitkovsky (2011a) spectacularly illustrate this possibility. In these simulations,
the shock is triggered via collision of the wind with a stationary wall. At some distance downstream of the shock the
ﬂow decelerates from high Lorentz factor to full stop, which shortens the time scale of all processes via the relativistic
time-dilation eﬀect. Reconnection in the current sheets accelerates and the magnetic ﬁeld of stripes dissipates, with its
energy used to heat the wind plasma. The conversion of magnetic energy to heat is accompanied by a decrease of the
speciﬁc volume and hence by additional plasma compression. As the result, relative to the shocked plasma the shock
propagates at speed well below the speed of light but close to that of a shock in ultra-relativistic unmagnetized plasma,
vs (cid:39) c/3. The role of magnetic dissipation of the shock speed has been studied theoretically by Lyubarsky (2003)

In the following, we discuss the results of driven evolution of ABC structure using both ﬂuid and PIC simulations.
We ﬁnd that using both ﬂuid and PIC codes, that imposing ﬁnite amplitude perturbations from the beginning triggers
the instability much faster.

7.1. Evolution of compressed 2D ABC equilibrium:force-free simulations

In force-free simulations we added an initial perturbation δAz = δa ∗ (sin(kx) + sin(ky)) ∗ cos(k(y − x)/2), where
δa is an amplitude of a perturbations. We ﬁnd that this leads to the earlier onset of the non-linear stage of instability
depending on the amplitude of perturbations, Fig. 40.

Fig. 40.— Left Panel Electromagnetic energy and perturbation amplitude of force-free simulations as functions of time
for a case of initial state with ﬁnite amplitude perturbations, chosen to have a large contribution from unstable modes.
In comparison with the unstressed system of magnetic islands (Left Panel Fig. 28), the instability starts to grow
immediately.

To ﬁnd conﬁgurations that immediately display a large reconnecting electric ﬁeld, we turn to the stressed single
island case. This is just a cut-out of the muliple-island ABC ﬁelds, adopting an aspect ratio R (cid:54)= 1. We choose R = 0.9
as initial perturbation. We choose three diﬀerent values for the parallel conductivity κ|| ∈ [500, 1000, 2000] and set the
perpendicular component to zero κ⊥ = 0.

The over-all evolution is displayed in Figs. 41, 42 and 43.

7.2. Collision-triggered merger of magnetic islands: MHD simulations

Next, we study the role of collisions in triggering magnetic reconnection and dissipation using the framework of
resistive force-free electrodynamics (magnetodynamics). In the ﬂuid frame, the structure of colliding ﬂows is that of
the unstressed 2D ABC conﬁguration. In order obtain its structure in the lab-frame one can simply apply the Lorentz
transformation for the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Hence for the ﬂow moving along the x axis to the left with speed v, we
have

where Γ is the Lorentz factor. Via replacing v with −v, we obtain the solution for the ﬂow moving to right with the
same speed. To initiate the collision, one can introduce at t = 0 a discontinuity at x = 0 so that the ﬂow is moving to
the left for x > 0 and to the right for x < 0. The corresponding jumps at x = 0 are

[Bx] = [Bz] = [Ex] = [Ez = 0],

[By] = 2B(r)

[Ey] = 2E(r)

,

(34)

where index (r) refers to the value to the right of the discontinuity. Instead of studying the domain which includes both
ﬂows, one can treat x = 0 as a boundary with the boundary conditions described by Eqs. (34) and deal only with the
left (or the right) half of the domain. This is exactly what we did in our simulations.

In the simulations, we set B0 = 1, Γ = 3 and used the computational domain (0, 3L)× (−L, L), with a uniform grid
of 600× 400 computational cells. The boundary at x = 3L is treated as an inlet of the ﬂow described by Eq. (33). Hence
the solution at this boundary is given by these equation with x replaced by x + vt. The magnetic Reynolds number is
Rem = 103.

Figure 44 illustrates the solution at t = 4. To the right of x = 2 the ﬂow structure is the same as in the initial
solution. In the plot of Bz (top panel), one can clearly see the lattice of magnetic islands. It appears compressed along
the x axis, which is a signature of the relativistic length contraction eﬀect. To the left of x = 2, the islands rapidly
merge and form horizontal stripes of oppositely directed Bz. The in-plane magnetic ﬁeld is concentrated in the current
sheets separating these stripes.

Figure 45 shows the time evolution of the ﬂow using the Lorentz-invariant parameter pm = (B2 − E2)/2, which
plays the role of magnetic pressure. One can see that the evolution can be described as a wave propagation in the
direction away from the plane of collision. Behind this wave the magnetic pressure increases and the wave speed is
signiﬁcantly lower than the speed of light.

The wave properties are very diﬀerent from those of the basic hyperbolic waves of magnetodynamics. To illustrate

this fact, Figure 46 shows the solution of the Riemann problem

Left state: B = (2, 1, 2), E = (0, 0,−v) ;

Right state: B = (2,−1, 2), E = (0, 0, v) ,

which describes the collision of two uniform ﬂows. The collision speed v is the same as before ( Γ = 3). The collision
creates both the fast wave (FW) and the Alfv´en wave (AW). One can see that, the fast wave propagates with the speed
of light and the magnetic pressure is invariant across AW (Komissarov, 2002).

Comparing the results of the test Rienmann problem with the main simulations, we conclude that the main wave
is not AW because the magnetic pressure is not invariant and not FW as its speed is signiﬁcantly less than the speed of
light. In fact, the top-left panel (t = 1) of Figure 45 shows a weak linear feature located at x = 1 which can be identiﬁed
with the FW produced by the collision. A similar, but weaker feature can also be seen in the top-right panel (t = 2).
Presumable, this wave gets scattered by the inhomogeneities of the incoming ﬂow and gradually looses coherence. Other

and Bx at time t = 4.

ﬁne arc-like features seen in front of the main wave (e.g. in the region 1.2 < x < 1.7 ) are likely to be fast waves emitted
by the turbulence downstream of the main wave.

The main wave, which we will refer to as the dissipation front, seems to start as an Alfv´en wave. Immediately
downstream of the Alfv´en wave, the Bz component of the magnetic ﬁeld increases (see the middle panel of Fig.46),
and hence the ABC conﬁguration remains highly squashed along the x-axis. However, the ﬂow comes to halt in the x
direction and the X-points are now highly stressed in the ﬂuid frame18. This leads to their immediate collapse and rapid
merger of the ABC islands, as described in §7.1. The increase of pm seems to be a product of magnetic dissipation that

18In magnetodynamics, there no unique way to deﬁne the ﬂuid frame. If the electric ﬁeld vanishes in one frame then it also vanishes in

any other frame moving relative to this one along the magnetic ﬁeld.

follows the merger.

Since the dissipation front is not a well deﬁned surface of ﬁxed shape, it is rather diﬃcult to measure its speed.

– 72 –

However even naked eye inspection of the plots suggest that it monotonically decreases with time with saturation
towards the end of the run. Crude measurements based on the position of ﬁrst features showing strong deviation from
the properties of incoming ﬂow give vdf (cid:39) 0.73 , 0.47 , 0.45 , 0.40 , 0.38 and 0.37.

To see how the magnetic dissipation can inﬂuence the front speed, we analyze the energy and momentum conser-
vation in our problem. (This approach is similar to that used by (Lyubarsky 2003).) To simplify the analysis we ignore
the complicated electromagnetic structure of ﬂow and assume that the magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to the front. Denote
the front position as xdf and use indexes 1 and 2 to indicate the ﬂow parameters upstream of the front and downstream
of its dissipation zone the front respectively. Since our equations do not include particles pressure and energy, and the
dissipated electromagnetic energy simply vanishes this analysis is only relevant for the case of rapid radiative cooling.

the dissipation eﬃciency. From this we ﬁnd that in the absence of dissipation the shock speed equals to the speed of
light and thus recover the result for ideal magnetodynamics. In the opposite case of total dissipation, the front speed
vanishes, as expected. The ﬁnal value of vs = 0.37 found in our simulations corresponds to the dissipation eﬃciency
α = 86%.

7.3. Driven ABC evolution: PIC simulation

7.3.1. 2D ABC structures with initial shear

Next we investigate a driven evolution of the ABC structures using PIC simulations. Inspired by the development
of the oblique mode described in Fig. 23, we set up our system with an initial velocity in the oblique direction, so that
two neighboring chains of ABC islands will shear with respect to each other. More precisely, we set up an initial velocity
proﬁle of the form

vx = −vpush cos[π(x + y)/L]/√2
vy = −vx
vz = 0

(39)

and we explore the eﬀect of diﬀerent values of vpush.19

Fig. 47 shows that the evolution of the electric energy (top panel, in units of the total initial energy) is remarkably
independent of vpush, apart from an overall shift in the onset time. In all the cases, the electric energy grows exponentially
as ∝ exp (4ct/L) (compare with the black dashed line) until it peaks at ∼ 10% of the total initial energy (the time when
the electric energy peaks is indicated with the vertical colored dotted lines). In parallel, the maximum particle energy
γmax grows explosively (bottom panel in Fig. 47), with a temporal proﬁle that is nearly indentical in all the cases (once

19In addition to initializing a particle distribution with a net bulk velocity, we also set up the resulting −v × B/c electric ﬁeld.

the top panel shows that the electric energy grows exponentially as ∝ exp (4ct/L). The vertical dotted lines mark the
time when the electric energy peaks (colors correspond to the ﬁve values of vpush/c, as described above).

again, apart from an overall time shift). The initial value of the electric energy scales as v2

push for large vpush (black for
vpush/c = 10−1 and blue for vpush/c = 10−2), just as a consequence of the electric ﬁeld −vpush × B/c that we initialize.

At smaller values of vpush, the initial value of the electric energy is independent of vpush (green to red curves in the top
panel). Here, we are sensitive to the electric ﬁeld required to build up the particle currents implied by the steady ABC
setup. Overall, the similarity of the diﬀerent curves in Fig. 47 (all the way to the undriven case of vpush = 0, in red)
conﬁrms that the oblique “shearing” mode is a natural instability avenue for 2D ABC structures.

As a consequence, it is not surprising that the particle spectrum measured at the time when the electric energy
peaks (as indicated by the vertical colored lines in Fig. 47) bears no memory of the driving speed vpush. In fact, the ﬁve
curves in Fig. 48 nearly overlap.

7.3.2. 2D ABC structures with initial stress

We now investigate the evolution of ABC structures in the presence of an initial stress, quantiﬁed by the stress
parameter λ (see Sect. 4.2 for the deﬁnition of λ in the context of solitary X-point collapse). The unstressed cases
discussed so far would correspond to λ = 1. The simulation box will be a rectangle with size 2L along the x direction
and 2λL along the y direction, with periodic boundary conditions.

Fig. 49 shows the temporal evolution of the 2D pattern of the out-of-plane ﬁeld Bz (in units of B0,in) from a PIC
simulation with kT /mc2 = 10−4, σin = 42 and L = 126 rL,hot. The system is initially squeezed along the y direction,
with a stress parameter of λ = 0.94 (top left panel). The initial stress leads to X-point collapse and formation of current
sheets (see the current sheet at x = 0 and y = 0.5L in the top right panel). This early phase results in a minimal amount
of magnetic energy dissipation (see the top panel in Fig. 50, with the solid blue line indicating the magnetic energy
and the red line indicating the particle kinetic energy), but signiﬁcant particle acceleration. As indicated in the bottom
panel of Fig. 50, the high-energy cutoﬀ γmax of the particle distribution grows quickly (within one dynamical time) up
to γmax/γth ∼ 1.5 × 102. At this point, the increase in the maximum particle energy stalls. In Fig. 49, we ﬁnd that
this corresponds to a phase in which the system tends to counteract the initial stress. In particular, the reconnection
outﬂows emanating from the current sheets in the top right panel of Fig. 49 push away neighboring magnetic structures
(the current sheet at x = 0 and y = 0.5L pushes away the two blue islands at y = 0.5L and x = ±0.5L). The system
gets squeezed along the x direction (middle left panel), i.e., the stress is now opposite to the initial stress. Shortly
thereafter, the ABC structure goes unstable on a dynamical timescale (middle right panel), with a pattern similar to
the case of spontaneous (i.e., unstressed) ABC instability. In particular, the middle right panel in Fig. 49 shows that
in this case the instability proceeds via the “parallel” mode depicted in Fig. 24 (but other simulations are dominated
by the “oblique” mode sketched in Fig. 23). The subsequent evolution closely resembles the case of spontaneous ABC
instability shown in Fig. 29, with the current sheets stretching up to a length ∼ L and the merger of islands having the
same Bz polarity (bottom left panel in Fig. 49), until only two regions remain in the box, with Bz ﬁelds of opposite
polarity (bottom right panel in Fig. 49).

The second stage of evolution — resembling the spontaneous instability of unstressed ABC structures — leads to
a dramatic episode of particle acceleration (see the growth in γmax in the bottom panel of Fig. 50 at ct/L ∼ 4), with
the energy spectral cutoﬀ extending beyond γmax/γth ∼ 103 within one dynamical time. This fast increase in γmax
is indeed reminiscent of what we had observed in the case of unstressed ABC instability (compare with the bottom
panel in Fig. 30 at ct/L ∼ 5). In analogy to the case of unstressed ABC structures, the instability leads to dramatic
particle acceleration, but only minor energy dissipation (the mean kinetic energy reaches a fraction ∼ 0.1 of the overall
energy budget). Additional dissipation of magnetic energy into particle heat (but without much non-thermal particle
acceleration) occurs at later times (ct/L (cid:38) 6) during subsequent island mergers, once again imitating the evolution of

each panel) with an initial stress of λ = 0.94 (see Sect. 4.2 for the deﬁnition of λ in the context of solitary X-point
collapse). The plot presents the 2D pattern of the out-of-plane ﬁeld Bz (in units of B0,in) from a PIC simulation with

kT /mc2 = 10−4, σin = 42 and L = 126 rL,hot, performed within a domain of size 2L × 2λL. The system is initially

squeezed along the y direction. This leads to X-point collapse and formation of current sheets (see the current sheet
at x = 0 and y = 0.5L in the top right panel). The resulting reconnection outﬂows push away neighboring magnetic
structures (the current sheet at x = 0 and y = 0.5L pushes away the two blue islands at y = 0.5L and x = ±0.5L).
The system is now squeezed along the x direction (middle left panel), and it goes unstable on a dynamical time (middle
right panel), similarly to the case of spontaneous (i.e., unstressed) ABC instability. The subsequent evolution closely
resembles the case of spontaneous ABC instability shown in Fig. 29.

relative to the thermal Lorentz factor γth (cid:39) 1 + (ˆγ − 1)−1kT /mc2, which for our case is γth (cid:39) 1. The early growth of
γmax up to γmax/γth ∼ 1.5 × 102 is due to particle acceleration at the current sheets induced by the initial stress. The
subsequent development of the ABC instability at ct/L (cid:39) 4 is accompanied by little ﬁeld dissipation (kin/tot(0) ∼ 0.1)
but dramatic particle acceleration, up to γmax/γth ∼ 103. In both panels, the vertical dotted black line indicates the

unstressed ABC instability.

The two distinct evolutionary phases — the early stage driven by the initial stress, and the subsequent dynamical
ABC collapse resembling the unstressed case — are clearly apparent in the evolution of the particle energy spectrum
(top panel in Fig. 51) and of the angle-averaged synchrotron emission (bottom panel in Fig. 51). The initial stress
drives fast particle acceleration at the resulting currrent sheets (from black to dark blue in the top panel). Once the
stress reverses, as part of the self-consistent evolution of the system (top right panel in Fig. 49), the particle energy
spectrum freezes (see the clustering of the dark blue lines). Correspondingly, the angle-averaged synchrotron spectrum
stops evolving (see the clustering of the dark blue lines in the bottom panel). A second dramatic increase in the particle
and emission spectral cutoﬀ (even more dramatic than the initial growth) occurs between ct/L ∼ 3 and ct/L ∼ 6 (dark
blue to cyan curves in Fig. 51), and it directly corresponds to the phase of ABC instability resembling the unstressed
case. The particle spectrum quickly extends up to γmax ∼ 103 (cyan lines in the top panel), and correspondigly the
peak of the νLν emission spectrum shifts up to ∼ γ2
maxνB,in ∼ 106νB,in (cyan lines in the bottom panel). At times later
than c/L ∼ 6, the evolution proceeds slower, similarly to the case of unstressed ABC instability: the high-energy cutoﬀ
in the particle spectrum shifts up by only a factor of three before saturating (green to red curves in the top panel), and
the peak frequency of the synchtron spectrum increases by less than a factor of ten (green to red curves in the bottom
panel). Rather than non-thermal particle acceleration, the late evolution is accompanied by substantial heating of the
bulk of the particles, with the peak of the particle spectrum shifting from γ ∼ 1 up to γ ∼ 10 after ct/L ∼ 6 (see also the
red line in the top panel of Fig. 50 at ct/L (cid:38) 6, indicating eﬃcient particle heating). Once again, this closely parallels
the late time evolution of unstressed ABC instability.

Finally, we point out that the particle distribution at the time when the electric energy peaks (indicated by the
vertical dotted line in Fig. 50) is nearly isotropic, as indicated by the inset in the top panel of Fig. 51. In turn, this
results in quasi-isotropic synchrotron emission (inset in the bottom panel). We refer to the unstressed case in Fig. 31
for an explanation of this result, which is peculiar to the ABC geometry employed here.

We conclude this subsection by investigating the eﬀect of the initial stress, as quantiﬁed by the squeezing parameter
λ. In Figs. 52 and 53, we present the results of a suite of ﬁve PIC simulations of ABC collapse with ﬁxed kT /mc2 = 10−4,
σin = 42 and L/rL,hot = 126, but diﬀerent magnitudes of the initial stress: λ = 0.78 (black), 0.87 (blue), 0.94 (green),
0.97 (yellow) and 1 (red; i.e., unstressed).
In all the cases, the early phase (until ct/L ∼ 3) bears memory of the
prescribed stress parameter λ. In particular, the value of the electric energy at early times increases for decreasing λ
(top panel in Fig. 52 at ct/L (cid:46) 3), as the initial stress becomes stronger. In parallel, the process of particle acceleration
initiated at the stressed X-points leads to a maximum particle energy γmax that reaches higher values for stronger
stresses (i.e., smaller λ, see the bottom panel of Fig. 52 at ct/L (cid:46) 3). While the early stage is sensitive to the value
of the initial stress, the dramatic evolution happening at ct/L ∼ 4 is remarkably similar for all the values of λ (cid:54)= 1
explored in Fig. 52 (black to yellow curves). In all the cases, the electric energy grows exponentially as ∝ exp (4ct/L).
Both the growth rate and the peak level of the electric energy (∼ 0.1 of the total energy) are remarkably insensitive to
λ, and they resemble the unstressed case λ = 1 (red curve in Fig. 52), aside from a temporal oﬀset of ∼ 2L/c. The fast
evolution occurring at ct/L ∼ 4 leads to dramatic particle acceleration (bottom panel in Fig. 52), with the high-energy
spectral cutoﬀ reaching γmax ∼ 103 within a dynamical time, once again imitating the results of the unstressed case,
aside from a temporal shift of ∼ 2L/c.

As we have just described, the electric energy peaks during the second phase, when the stressed systems evolve in
close similarity with the unstressed setup. In Fig. 53, we present a comparison of the particle spectra for diﬀerent λ
(as indicated in the legend), measured at the peak time of the electric energy (as indicated by the vertical dotted lines
in Fig. 52). The spectral shape for all the stressed cases is nearly identical, especially if the initial stress is not too
strong (i.e., with the only exception of the black line, corresponding to λ = 0.78). In addition, the spectral cutoﬀ is in
remarkable agreement with the result of the unstressed setup (red curve in Fig. 53), conﬁrming that the evolution of

(yellow) and 1 (red; i.e., unstressed). The early phases (until ct/L ∼ 3) bear memory of the prescribed stress parameter
λ, whereas the evolution subsequent to the ABC collapse at ct/L ∼ 4 is remarkably similar for diﬀerent values of λ.
The dashed black line in the top panel shows that the electric energy grows exponentially as ∝ exp (4ct/L), during the
dynamical phase of the ABC instability. The vertical dotted lines mark the time when the electric energy peaks (colors
correspond to the ﬁve values of λ, as described above; the black, green and yellow vertical lines overlap).

Fig. 52): λ = 0.78 (black), 0.87 (blue), 0.94 (green), 0.97 (yellow) and 1 (red; i.e., unstressed). The main plot shows
γdN/dγ to emphasize the particle content, whereas the inset presents γ2dN/dγ to highlight the energy census. The

dotted black line is a power law γdN/dγ ∝ γ−1, corresponding to equal energy content per decade (which would result in

a ﬂat distribution in the inset). The particle spectrum at the time when the electric energy peaks has little dependence
on the initial stress parameter λ, and it resembles the result of the spontaneous ABC instability (red curve).

– 82 –

the stressed cases closely parallels the spontaneous ABC instability.

We conclude that this setup — with an initially imposed stress — is not a preferred mode of instability for the
ABC structure (unlike the shearing setup described in the previous subsection, which directly leads to ABC collapse).
Still, the perturbation imposed onto the system eventually leads to ABC instability, which proceeds in close analogy to
the unstressed case. Particle acceleration to the highest energies is not achieved in the initial phase, which still bears
memory of the imposed stress, but rather in the quasi-spontaneous ABC collapse at later times. In order to further test
this claim, we have performed the following experiment. After the initial evolution (driven by the imposed stress), we
artiﬁcially reduce the energies of the highest energy particles (but still keeping them ultra-relativistic, to approximately
preserve the electric currents). The subsequent evolution of the high-energy particle spectrum is similar to what we
observe when we do not artiﬁcially “cool” the particles, which is another conﬁrmation of the fact that the long-term
physics is independent from the initial stress.

8. Merging ﬂux tubes carrying zero total current

In Sections 3-6-7 we considered evolution of the unstable conﬁgurations – those of the stressed X-point and 2D
ABC conﬁgurations (both stressed and unstressed). We found that during the development of instability of the 2D
ABC conﬁgurations the particles are eﬃciently accelerated during the initial dynamical phase of the merger of current-
carrying ﬂux tubes (when the evolution is mostly due to the X-point collapse). There are two key feature of the preceding
model that are speciﬁc to the initial set-up: (i) each ﬂux tube carries non-zero poloidal current; (ii) the initial 2D ABC
conﬁguration is an unstable equilibrium. It is not clear how generic these conditions and how the details of particle
acceleration are aﬀected by these speciﬁc properties.

In this section we relax these conditions. We investigate a merger of two ﬂux tubes with zero total current. We will
study, using relativistic MHD and PIC simulations, the evolution of colliding ﬂux tubes with various internal structure.
Importantly, all the cases under investigation have a common property: they carry zero net poloidal current (either
completely distributed electric currents as in the case of conﬁgurations (40) and (8.2), or balanced by the surface current,
(44)). Thus, two ﬂux tubes are not attracted to each other - at least initially. All the conﬁgurations considered have a
common property: the current in the core of the ﬂux tube is balanced by the reverse current in the outer parts.

8.1. Force-free simulations

8.1.1. Merger of Lundquist’s magnetic ropes

First we consider Lundquist’s force-free cylinders, surrounded by uniform magnetic ﬁeld,

BL(r ≤ rj) = J1(rα)eφ + J0(rα)ez ,

(40)

Here, J0, J1 are Bessel functions of zeroth and ﬁrst order and the constant α (cid:39) 3.8317 is the ﬁrst root of J0. We chose
to terminate this solution at the ﬁrst zero of J1, which we denote as rj and hence continue with Bz = Bz(rj) and Bφ = 0
for r > rj. Thus the total current of the ﬂux tube is zero. As the result, the azimuthal ﬁeld vanishes at the boundary
of the rope, whereas the poloidal one changes sign inside the rope.

We start with the position of two ropes just touching each other and set the centre positions to be xc = (−rj, 0)
and xc = (rj, 0). The evolution is very slow, given the fact that at the contact the reconnecting ﬁeld vanishes. To speed
things up, we “push” the ropes towards each other by imposing a drift velocity. That is, we initialize the electric ﬁeld

E = −(1/c)vkick×B ,

(41)

where vkick = (±vkick, 0, 0) inside the ropes and here we set vkick = 0.1c.

The numerical setup is as follows: We have adopted the force-free algorithm of Komissarov et al. (2007) to create a
physics module in the publicly available code MPI-AMRVAC20 Porth et al. (2014b); Keppens et al. (2012). We simulate
a 2D Cartesian domain with x ∈ [−6, 6] and y ∈ [−3, 3] at a base-resolution of 128× 64 cells. In the following, the scales
are given in units of rj. During the evolution, we ensure that the FWHM of the current density in the current sheet is
resolved by at least 16 cells via local adaptive mesh reﬁnement of up to eight levels, each increasing the resolution by a
factor of two. Boundary conditions are set to “periodic”.

The results are illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the distribution of Bz and χ ≡ 1 − E2/B2 at t = 0, 2, 5, 6, 9.
Interestingly, around the time t ≈ 5, the cores (with Bz of the same sign) of the ﬂux tubes begin to merge. This leads
to zero guide ﬁeld in the current sheet and increased reconnection rate. The sudden increase in reconnection rate leads
to a strong wave being emitted from the current sheet which is also seen in the decrease to χ ≈ 0.7 in the outer part of
the ﬂux tubes, i.e. in the fourth panel of ﬁgure 54.

The inﬂuence of the guide ﬁeld is investigated in Figure 55.

In the left panel, we show cuts of Bz along the
y = 0 plane. As the in-plane magnetic ﬂux reconnects in the current sheet, the out-of-plane component remains and
accumulates, leading to a steep proﬁle with magnetic pressure that opposes the inward motion of reconnecting ﬁeld
lines. At t = 5.2, the guide ﬁeld changes sign and the reconnection rate spikes rapidly at a value of vr ≈ 0.6. This is
clearly seen in the right panel of ﬁgure 55. Thereafter, a guide ﬁeld of the opposite sign builds up and the reconnection
rate slows down again. The position of the ﬂux-tube core as quantiﬁed by the peak of Bz evolves for t < rj/c according
to the prescribed velocity kick Eq. (41) but then settles for a slower evolution governed by the resistive timescale.

8.2. Modiﬁed Lundquist’s magnetic ropes

8.2.1. Description of setup

For the future analysis, we consider a modiﬁed version of Lundquist’s force-free cylinders discussed in the previous

section 8.1.1. The toroidal ﬁeld is the same as given by equation 40, but the vertical ﬁeld reads

Bz(r ≤ rj) =(cid:112)

J0(αr)2 + C

(42)

within a ﬂux tube and is set to Bz(rj) in the external medium. As a result, the sign-change of the guide-ﬁeld is avoided
and only positive values of Bz are present. The additional constant C sets the minimum (positive) vertical magnetic
ﬁeld component. In the following, we always set C = 0.01.

In this section, we will investigate dependence of reconnection rate and electric ﬁeld magnitude on the kick velocity

and magnetic Reynolds number.

8.2.2. Overall evolution

As the current vanishes on the surface of the ﬂux tubes, the initial Lorentz force also vanishes and the ﬂux tubes
approach each other on the time scale given by the kick velocity. Then a current sheet is formed at the intersection
which reconnects in-plane magnetic ﬂux resulting in an engulﬁng ﬁeld. This evolution is illustrated in ﬁgure 56 for
an exemplary run with (vkick, η||) = (0.03c, 10−3), showing out-of plane magnetic ﬁeld strength Bz and the previously
introduced parameter χ = 1− E2/B2. It can be seen that in the outﬂow region of the current sheet, χ assumes values as
small as χmin = 0.09 but the distributed region of χ ≈ 0.7 that is observed for the unmodiﬁed Lundquist tubes is absent.
After the peak reconnection rate which for the shown parameters is reached at t (cid:39) 9, the system undergoes oscillations
between prolate and oblate shape during which the current sheet shrinks. The oscillation frequency corresponds to a

8.2.3. Dependence on kick velocity

We now vary the magnitude of the initial perturbation in the interval vkick ∈ [0.03c, 0.3c]. Figure 57 gives an
overview of the morphology when the peak reconnection rate is reached. The reconnection rate is measured as inﬂowing
drift velocity at x = ±0.05 and is averaged over a vertical extent of ∆y = 0.1. For the lower three kick velocities, we
obtain a very similar morphology when the peak reconnection rate is reached. With vkick = 0.3c, the ﬂux tubes rebound,
resulting in emission of waves in the ambient medium. As the ﬂux tubes dynamically react to the large perturbation,
it is not possible to force a higher reconnection rate by smashing them together with high velocity, they simply bounce
oﬀ due to the magnetic tension in each ﬂux tube. However, high velocity perturbations of vkick = 0.1c and vkick = 0.3c
lead to the formation of plasmoids which are absent in the cases with small perturbation and this in turn can impact
on the reconnection rate.

A more quantitative view is shown in Figure 58 illustrating the evolution of the mean electric energy in the domain
(cid:104)E2(cid:105)(t) and reconnection rate as previously deﬁned. One can see that all simulations reach a comparable electric ﬁeld
strength in the domain, independent of the initial perturbation. The electric ﬁeld grows exponentially with comparable
growth rate and also the saturation values are only weakly dependent on the initial perturbation. Indeed, comparing
highest and lowest kick velocities, we ﬁnd that (cid:104)E2(cid:105)max is within a factor of two for a range of 30 in the velocity
perturbation.

In the evolution of (cid:104)E2(cid:105)(t), one can also read oﬀ the oscillation period of P ≈ 1rj/c, most pronounced in the
strongly perturbed case. The span of peak reconnection rates is similar to the mean electric ﬁeld strength with a range
from vr = 0.2 down to vr = 0.11. The reconnection rate saturates at ∼ 0.1c for vanishing initial perturbation. When
plasmoids are triggered, as for the case vr = 0.1 and vr = 0.3, the run of vr shows additional substructure leading to
secondary peaks as seen e.g. in the green curve on the lower panel.

8.2.4. Scaling with magnetic Reynolds number

We next investigate the scaling of reconnection rate with magnetic Reynolds number while keeping a ﬁxed kick
velocity of 0.1c. As astrophysical Reynolds numbers are typically much larger than what can be achieved numerically,
this is an important check for the applicability of the results. For the force-free case, we simply deﬁne the Lundquist
number

(43)

and check the scaling via the resistivity parameter η||.

S =

rjc
η|| (cid:39) η

−1||

Figure 59 (left panel), shows the run of the domain averaged electric ﬁeld and the reconnection rate as in Figure 58.
In general, the initial evolution progresses faster when larger resistivities are considered, suggesting a scaling with the
resistive time. However, once a signiﬁcant amount of magnetic ﬂux has reconnected, the electric energy in the domain
peaks at values within a factor of 1.5 for a signiﬁcant range of Reynolds numbers η|| ∈ [1/100, 1/4000]. Very good
agreement is found for the peak reconnection rate of vr (cid:39) 0.15c. The η|| = 4000 run developed plasmoids at t (cid:39) 8 which
were not observed in the other runs.

We have also conducted a range of experiments in resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). The setup
is as the force-free conﬁguration described above, however we now choose constant values for density and pressure such

right panel correspond to the same resistivity parameter of η||, η = 1/1000 and cyan (left) and red (right) curves both
correspond to η||, η = 1/4000. The initial evolution up to the wave-reﬂection feature at t = 2 is very similar in both
realisations. Afterwards the evolution diﬀers: while the reconnection rate in the force-free run with η|| = 1/4000 increases
to reach a peak of vr (cid:39) 0.15c at t (cid:39) 9, vr remains approximately constant in the corresponding RMHD run. In contrast to
the force-free scenario, the RMHD runs did not feature any plasmoids at the Reynolds numbers considered here. Better
agreement is found for η||, η = 1/1000 (green curves in both panels). Here, the force-free reconnection rate reaches its
peak value of vr (cid:39) 0.14 at t (cid:39) 6 and the RMHD peaks at t (cid:39) 7 with vr (cid:39) 0.07c. Increasing the magnetisation improves
the match between both cases: In the green dashed (dotted) curve, we have doubled (quadrupled) the magnetization by
lowering plasma density and pressure in the SRMHD runs at η = 1/1000. One can see that the evolution speeds up and
higher reconnection rates are achieved: For the highest magnetisation run, we reach the peak reconnection rate of (cid:39) 0.1c
and the peak is reached already at t (cid:39) 6.2 very similar to the corresponding force-free run which peaked at t (cid:39) 6 with
vr (cid:39) 0.13c. This indicates that the RMHD model indeed approaches the force-free limit for increasing magnetization.

observed in the other runs. Right: Corresponding resistive MHD evolution with σ ∈ [1.7, 10] and doubled (dashed) and

8.3. Core-envelope magnetic ropes

8.3.1. Description of setup

We now adopt a setup where the current does no return volumetrically within the ﬂux tube, but returns as a current
sheet on the surface. The solution is based on the “core-envelope” solution of Komissarov (1999), with the gas pressure
replaced by the pressure of the poloidal ﬁeld. Speciﬁcally, the proﬁles read

rj is the outer radius of the rope and rm is the radius of its core. In the simulations, rm = 0.5, Bm = 1, α = 0.2 and
the coordinates are scaled to rj = 1. As in the previous cases, two identical current tubes are centred at (x, y) = (−1, 0)
and (x, y) = (1, 0). They are at rest and barely touch each other at (x, y) = (0, 0). In this scenario, since the current
closes discontinuously at the surface of the ﬂux tubes, the Lorentz-force acting on the outer ﬁeld lines is non-vanishing.
Thus we can dispense with the initial perturbation and always set vkick = 0.

8.3.2. Overall evolution

The overall evolution is characterised as follows: Immediately, a current-sheet forms at the point (0,0) and two
Y-points get expelled in vertical direction with initial speed of c. The expansion of the Y-points is thereafter slowed
down by the accumulating pressure of Bz in the ambient medium. Snapshots of Bz for the case η|| = 1/500 are shown
in ﬁgure 60. The stage of most rapid evolution of the cores is at t (cid:39) 4. At this time, the morphology is comparable to
the modiﬁed Lundquist ropes, i.e. Figure 57.

We quantify the evolution of Y-point (0, yyp) via the peak in Ex along the x = 0 line and the core location (xc, 0)
as peak of Bz along the y = 0 line. The data is shown in the top panel of ﬁgure 61. One can see the Y-point slowing
down from its initial very fast motion. Gradually, the cores accelerate their approach, reaching a maximal velocity at
t (cid:39) 4. The evolution stalls as the guide-ﬁeld at (0, 0) reaches its maximum and magnetic pressure in the current sheet
balances the tension of the encompassing ﬁeld.

8.3.3. Scaling with magnetic Reynolds number

As for the modiﬁed Lundquist ropes, section 8.2.4, we investigate the dependence of the dynamics with magnetic
Reynolds number by varying the resistivity parameter. An overview of relevant quantities is given in Figure 62 for the
range η|| ∈ [1/500, 1/8000]. After the onset-time of ≈ rj/c, all runs enter into a phase where the electric energy grows
according to ∝ exp(tc/rj). As expected, the electric energy decreases when the conductivity is increased. Between
t (cid:39) 4 and t (cid:39) 5, the growth of the electric energy saturates and the evolution slows down. In general, we observe two

regimes: Up to η|| = 1/4000, the reconnection rate decreases with increasing conductivity, as would be expected in a
Sweet-Parker scaling. In this regime, also the motion of the cores slows down when η|| is decreased. Whereas the most
rapid motion for η|| = 1/500 was found at t (cid:39) 4, for η|| = 1/4000 it is delayed to t (cid:39) 5 (c.f. 62, lower panel).

The case with the highest conductivity, η|| = 1/8000 breaks the trend of the low conductivity cases. Here, the
reconnection rate increases continuously up to t (cid:39) 4.5 at which point it rapidly ﬂares to a large value of vr (cid:39) 0.25c
where it remains for somewhat less than rj/c. Also the slowing of the core-motion is halted at η|| = 1/8000: Up to
t (cid:39) 5, the core position lines up well with the case η|| = 1/4000. Just after the ﬂare, the ﬂux tube merger is accelerated
as evidenced by the rapid decline of xc.

electric ﬁeld strength (cid:104)E2(cid:105). After one light-crossing time we observe a growth according to ∝ exp(tc/rj) indicated as
black dashed line. Middle: Reconnection rate, measured as drift velocity through x = ±0.1. The dynamical evolution
for η|| = 1/8000 is very diﬀerent from the cases η|| = 1/1000, 1/2000, 1/4000. In those cases, one large plasmoid would
form and remain stationary in the current sheet until very late times (t > 6). In the lowest resistivity case however,
many small plasmoids are created which expel ﬂux continuously to both sides. Thus the magnetic tension surrounding
the structure grows more rapidly, leading to the explosive increase of reconnection at t (cid:39) 4.5. Bottom: Core position
for the three selected cases η|| = 1/500, 1/4000, 1/8000. In the regime η|| ∈ [1/500, 1/4000], the merging of the cores
slows down as electric conductivity increases. For η|| = 1/8000 however, this trend is halted and reversed as the motion
of the cores actually speeds up after the peak in reconnection rate at t (cid:39) 5. This ﬁgure can be compared to the PIC
results shown in Figure 78.

It is interesting to ask why the dynamics changed so dramatically for the case η|| = 1/8000.

In ﬁgure 63, we
show snapshots of χ = 1 − E2/B2 at the time t = 5 for the two highest conductivity cases. At this point, in the
lower conductivity case, a single large central plasmoid has formed that remains in the current sheet for the entire
evolution. This qualitative picture also holds for the cases η|| = 1/1000, 1/2000. Flux that accumulates in the central
plasmoid does not get expelled from the current sheet and so does not add to the magnetic tension which pushes the
ropes together. Furthermore, the single island opposes the merger via its magnetic pressure of the accumulated Bz.

For the case η|| = 1/8000, the large-scale plasmoid does not form, instead smaller plasmoids are expelled symmetrically
in both directions. The expelled ﬂux continues to contribute to the large scale stresses and the merger of the islands
is accelerated further which is reﬂected also in the continued exponential rise of the electric energy shown in ﬁgure
62. As in the case of the Lundquist and modiﬁed Lundquist ﬂux tubes and as required for rapid particle acceleration,
macroscopic regions of E > B are found also in this conﬁguration in the outﬂow regions of the current sheet, illustrated
in ﬁgure 63.

In conclusion, our force-free experiments of coalescing ﬂux tubes show that scale stresses can lead to high reconnec-
tion rates in the range of 0.1c − 0.3c, independent of the magnetic Reynolds number. The dynamics is highly nonlinear
and depends on the details of the reconnection in the current sheet: When a single large plasmoid is formed in the current
sheet, rapid instability can be avoided. This was the case in the three intermediate resistivity cases for the core-envelope
conﬁguration considered here. Also the original Lundquist tubes showed a rapid reconnection ﬂare of vr (cid:39) 0.6c. The
reason is the sign change of the Bz component, leading to vanishing guide ﬁeld and a missing restoring force in the
current sheet. As guide ﬁeld with opposite polarity builds up in the current sheet thereafter, the fast reconnection is
quickly stalled.

cases at the time of the reconnection ﬂare at t = 5: η|| = 1/4000 (top) and η|| = 1/8000 (middle). One can clearly
see the diﬀerent qualitative behaviour: In the former case, a single large plasmoid grows in the centre of the current
sheet, in the latter case, instead small scale plasmoids are expelled in both directions. At this time, there are also
clear diﬀerences in the position of the Y-point: in the high conductivity case, the Y-point is notably further out as the
evolution has progressed faster. As the evolution progresses, a large connected charge starved area develops as seen in
the bottom panel for η|| = 1/8000 at t = 5.5rj/c.

8.4. PIC simulations of 2D ﬂux tube mergers: simulation setup

We study the evolution of 2D ﬂux tubes with PIC simulations, employing the electromagnetic PIC code TRISTAN-
MP (Buneman 1993; Spitkovsky 2005). We analyze two possible ﬁeld conﬁgurations: (i) Lundquist magnetic ropes (see
Eq. 40), containing zero total current (so, the azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld vanishes at the boundaries of the rope); (ii)
core-envelope ropes (see Eqs. 44 and 45) this conﬁguration has nonzero total volumetric current, which is cancelled by
the surface current.

Our computational domain is a rectangle in the x − y plane, with periodic boundary conditions in both directions.
The simulation box is initialized with a uniform density of electron-positron plasma at rest and with the magnetic
ﬁeld appropriate for the Lundquist or core-envelope conﬁguration. Since the azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld vanishes at the
boundaries of the Lundquist ropes, the evolution is very slow. Actually, we do not see any sign of evolution up to the
ﬁnal time ∼ 20 c/ rj of our simulation of undriven Lundquist ropes. For this reason, we push by hand the two ropes
toward each other, with a prescribed vpush whose eﬀects will be investigated below. It follows that inside the ropes we
start with the magnetic ﬁeld in Eq. 40 and with the electric ﬁeld E = −vpush × B/c, whereas the electric ﬁeld is initially
zero outside the ropes.

The azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld does not vanish at the boundaries of the core-envelope ropes, and the system evolves
self-consistently (so, we do not need to drive the system by hand). Here, both the azimuthal ﬁeld and the poloidal ﬁeld
are discontinuous at the boundary of the ropes. A particle current would be needed to sustain the curl of the ﬁeld. In our
setup, the computational particles are initialized at rest, but such electric current gets self-consistently built up within
a few timesteps. To facilitate comparison with the force-free results, our core-envelope conﬁguration has rm/ rj = 0.5
and α = 0.2, the same values as in the force-free simulation of Fig. 60.

For our ﬁducial runs, the spatial resolution is such that the plasma skin depth c/ωp is resolved with 2.5 cells, but
we have veriﬁed that our results are the same up to a resolution of c/ωp = 10 cells. We only investigate the case of a
cold background plasma, with initial thermal dispersion kT /mc2 = 10−4.21 Each cell is initialized with two positrons
and two electrons, but we have checked that our results are the same when using up to 64 particles per cell. In order
to reduce noise in the simulation, we ﬁlter the electric current deposited onto the grid by the particles, mimicking the
eﬀect of a larger number of particles per cell (Spitkovsky 2005; Belyaev 2015).

Our unit of length is the radius rj of the ﬂux ropes, and time is measured in units of rj/c. Our domain is typically
a large rectangle of size 10 rj along x (i.e., along the direction connecting the centers of the two ropes) and of size 6 rj
along y (but we have tested that a smaller domain with 5 rj × 3 rj gives the same results). A large domain is needed to
minimize the eﬀect of the boundary conditions on the evolution of the system.

We explore the dependence of our results on the ﬂow magnetization. We identify our runs via the mean value σin
of the magnetization measured within the ﬂux ropes using the initial in-plane ﬁelds (so, excluding the Bz ﬁeld). As we
argue below, it is the dissipation of the in-plane ﬁelds that primarily drives eﬃcient heating and particle acceleration.
In addition, this choice allows for a direct comparison of our results between the two conﬁgurations (Lundquist and
core-envelope) and with the ABC structures of Sect. 6.4. The mean in-plane ﬁeld corresponding to σin shall be called
B0,in, and it will be our unit of measure of the electromagnetic ﬁelds. We will explore a wide range of magnetizations,
from σin = 3 up to σin = 170.

It will be convenient to compare the radius rj of the ropes to the characteristic Larmor radius rL,hot = √σin c/ωp
of the high-energy particles heated/accelerated by reconnection (rather than to the skin depth c/ωp). We will explore a

21For a hot background plasma, the results are expected to be the same (apart from an overall shift in the energy scale), once the skin
depth and the magnetization are properly deﬁned. We point to Sect. 6.4 for a demonstration of this claim in the context of ABC structures.

wide range of rj/rL,hot, from rj/rL,hot = 31 up to 245. We will demonstrate that the two most fundamental parameters
that characterize the system are the magnetization σin and the ratio rj/rL,hot.

The temporal evolution of the merger of two Lundquist ropes is shown in Fig. 64. The plot presents the 2D
pattern of the out-of-plane ﬁeld Bz (left column; in units of B0,in) and of the in-plane magnetic energy fraction B,in =
y)/8πnmc2 (right column; with superimposed magnetic ﬁeld lines), from a PIC simulation with kT /mc2 = 10−4,
(B2
σin = 42 and rj = 61 rL,hot. The magnetic ropes are initially driven toward each other with a speed vpush/c = 0.1 (below,
we study the dependence on the driving speed). Time is measured in units of rj/c and indicated in the grey boxes
within each panel. The ﬁgure should be compared with the force-free result in Fig. 54 (even though vpush/c = 0.3 in
that case).

As the two magnetic ropes slowly approach, driven by the initial velocity push (compare the ﬁrst and second row
in Fig. 64), reconnection is triggered in the plane x = 0, as indicated by the formation and subsequent ejection of
small-scale plasmoids (third and fourth row in Fig. 64). So far (i.e., until ct/ rj ∼ 4.5), the cores of the two islands have
not signiﬁcantly moved (black line in the middle panel of Fig. 65, indicating the xc location of the center of the rightmost
island), the reconnection speed is quite small (red line in the middle panel of Fig. 65) and no signiﬁcant energy exchange
has occurred from the ﬁelds to the particles (compare the in-plane magnetic energy, shown by the dashed blue line in
the top panel of Fig. 65, with the particle kinetic energy, indicated with the red line).22 The only signiﬁcant evolution
before ct/ rj ∼ 4.5 is the reconnection-driven increase in the maximum particle Lorentz factor up to γmax/γth ∼ 40
occurring at ct/ rj ∼ 2.5 (see the black line in the bottom panel of Fig. 65).

As a result of reconnection, an increasing number of ﬁeld lines, that initially closed around one of the ropes, are now
engulﬁng both magnetic islands. Their tension force causes the two ropes to approach and merge on a quick (dynamical)
timescale, starting at ct/ rj ∼ 4.5 and ending at ct/ rj ∼ 7.5 (see that the distance of the rightmost island from the
center rapidly decreases, as indicated by the black line in the middle panel of Fig. 65). The tension force drives the
particles in the ﬂux ropes toward the center, with a fast reconnection speed peaking at vrec/c ∼ 0.3 (red line in the
middle panel of Fig. 65).23 The reconnection layer at x = 0 stretches up to a length of ∼ 2 rj, it becomes unstable
to the secondary tearing mode (Uzdensky et al. 2010), and secondary plasmoids are formed (e.g., see the plasmoid at
(x, y) ∼ (0, 0) at ct/ rj = 6). Below, we demonstrate that the formation of secondary plasmoids is primarily controlled
by the ratio rj/rL,hot. In the central current sheet, it is primarily the in-plane ﬁeld that gets dissipated (compare the
dashed and solid blue lines in the top panel of Fig. 65), driving an increase in the electric energy (green) and in the
particle kinetic energy (red).24 In this phase of evolution, the fraction of initial energy released to the particles is small
(kin/tot(0) ∼ 0.1), but the particles advected into the central X-point experience a dramatic episode of acceleration.

22We remark that the energy balance described in the top panel of Fig. 65 is dependent on the overall size of the box, everything else being
the same. More speciﬁcally, while the in-plane ﬁelds (which are the primary source of dissipation) are nonzero only within the ﬂux ropes,
the out-of-plane ﬁeld pervades the whole domain. It follows that for a larger box the relative ratios between kin (red line; or E, green line)
and B,in (dashed blue line) will not change, whereas they will all decrease as compared to the total magnetic energy B (blue solid line).

23This value of the reconnection rate is roughly comparable to the results of solitary X-point collapse presented in Sect. 4.2. However,
a direct comparison cannot be established, since in that case we either assumed a uniform nonzero guide ﬁeld or a vanishing guide ﬁeld,
whereas here the guide ﬁeld strength is not uniform in space.

24The out-of-plane ﬁeld for the Lundquist conﬁguration in Eq. 40 switches sign inside the ﬂux ropes. In force free simulations, this leads
to the formation of large areas with E > B in the outermost regions of the ropes. We do not observe the formation of such features in PIC
simulations.

rectangular domain of size 10 rj × 6 rj (but we only show a small region around the center). The evolution is driven with
a velocity vpush/c = 0.1. Reconnection at the interface between the two ﬂux ropes (i.e., around x = y = 0) creates an
envelope of ﬁeld lines engulﬁng the two islands, whose tension force causes them to merge on a dynamical time. This
ﬁgure should be compared with the force-free result in Fig. 54 (even though vpush/c = 0.3 in that case).

to the thermal Lorentz factor γth (cid:39) 1 + (ˆγ − 1)−1kT /mc2, which for our case is γth (cid:39) 1. In response to the initial
push, γmax increases at ct/ rj ∼ 2 up to γmax/γth ∼ 40, before stalling. At this stage, the cores of the two islands have
not signiﬁcantly moved (black line in the middle panel). At ct/ rj ∼ 5, the tension force of the common envelope of
ﬁeld lines starts pushing the two islands toward each other (and the xc location of the rightmost rope decreases, see
the middle panel), resulting in a merger event occurring on a dynamical timescale. During the merger (at ct/ rj ∼ 6),
the reconnection rate peaks (red line in the middle panel), a fraction of the in-plane magnetic energy is transferred
to the plasma (compare dashed blue and solid red lines in the top panel), and particles are quickly accelerated up to
γmax/γth ∼ 103 (bottom panel). In all the panels, the vertical dotted black line indicates the time when the electric
energy peaks, shortly after the most violent phase of the merger event.

As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 65, the cutoﬀ Lorentz factor γmax of the particle spectrum presents a dramatic
evolution, increasing up to γmax/γth ∼ 103 within a couple of dynamical times. It is this phase of extremely fast particle
acceleration that we associate with the generation of the Crab ﬂares.

The two distinct evolutionary phases — the early stage driven by the initial velocity push, and the subsequent
dynamical merger driven by large-scale electromagnetic stresses — are clearly apparent in the evolution of the particle

from the fact that the electron spectrum at high energies is close to γdN/dγ ∝ const. This is harder than the dotted
line, which indicates the slope νLν ∝ ν1/2 resulting from an electron spectrum γdN/dγ ∝ γ−1.

energy spectrum (top panel in Fig. 66) and of the angle-averaged synchrotron emission (bottom panel in Fig. 66). The
initial velocity push drives reconnection in the central current sheet, which leads to fast particle acceleration (from
dark blue to cyan in the top panel). This is only a transient event, and the particle energy spectrum then freezes
(see the clustering of the cyan lines, and compare with the phase at 2.5 (cid:46) ct/ rj (cid:46) 4 in the bottom panel of Fig. 65).
Correspondingly, the angle-averaged synchrotron spectrum stops evolving (see the clustering of the cyan lines in the
bottom panel). A second dramatic increase in the particle and emission spectral cutoﬀ (even more dramatic than the
initial growth) occurs between ct/ rj ∼ 4.5 and ct/ rj ∼ 7 (cyan to yellow curves in Fig. 66), and it directly corresponds
to the dynamical merger of the two magnetic ropes, driven by large-scale stresses. The particle spectrum quickly extends
up to γmax ∼ 103 (yellow lines in the top panel), and correspondigly the peak of the νLν emission spectrum shifts up
to ∼ γ2
maxνB,in ∼ 106νB,in (yellow lines in the bottom panel). The system does not show any sign of evolution at times
later than c/ rj ∼ 7.5 (see the clustering of the yellow to red lines). At late times, the high-energy spectrum approaches
a hard distribution γdN/dγ ∝ const (for comparison, the dotted black line shows the case γdN/dγ ∝ γ−1 corresponding
to equal energy content in each decade of γ). The synchrotron spectrum approaches a power law with νLν ∝ ν, which
just follows from the fact that the electron spectrum at high energies is close to γdN/dγ ∝ const. This is harder than
the dotted line, which indicates the slope νLν ∝ ν1/2 resulting from an electron spectrum γdN/dγ ∝ γ−1.

The particle distribution is signiﬁcantly anisotropic. In the top panel of Fig. 67, we plot the electron momentum
spectrum at the time when the electric energy peaks (see the vertical black dotted line in Fig. 65) along diﬀerent
directions, as indicated in the legend. The highest energy electrons are beamed along the direction y of the reconnection
outﬂow (blue lines) and along the direction +z anti-parallel to the accelerating electric ﬁeld (red solid line; positrons
will be beamed along −z, due to the opposite charge). This is consistent with our results for solitary X-point collapse in
Sect. 4.2. Most of the anisotropy is to be attributed to the “kinetic beaming” discussed by Cerutti et al. (2012c), rather
than beaming associated with the bulk motion (which is only marginally relativistic, see the inset in the top panel of
Fig. 67). The anisotropy of the synchrotron emission (bottom panel in Fig. 67) is consistent with the particle anisotropy
illustrated in the inset of the top panel.

8.5.1. Dependence on the ﬂow conditions

We now investigate the dependence of our results on the magnetization σin and the ratio rj/rL,hot, where rL,hot =
√σin c/ωp. In Fig. 68, we present the 2D pattern of the out-of-plane ﬁeld Bz (in units of B0,in) during the most violent
phase of rope merger (i.e., when the electric energy peaks, as indicated by the vertical dotted lines in Fig. 69) from a suite
of PIC simulations in a rectangular domain of size 5 rj × 3 rj. In the left column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and σin = 11
and we vary the ratio rj/rL,hot, from 31 to 245 (from top to bottom). In the right column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and
rj/rL,hot = 61 and we vary the magnetization σin, from 3 to 170 (from top to bottom). The evolution is driven with a
velocity vpush/c = 0.1 in all the cases.

The 2D pattern of Bz presented in Fig. 68 shows that the merger proceeds in a similar way in all the runs. The
only diﬀerence is that larger rj/rL,hot lead to thinner current sheets, when ﬁxing σin (left column in Fig. 68). Roughly,
the thickness of the current sheet is set by the Larmor radius rL,hot of the high-energy particles heated/accelerated by
reconnection. In the right column, with rj/rL,hot ﬁxed, the thickness of the current sheet is then a ﬁxed fraction of
the box size. In contrast, in the left column, the ratio of current sheet thickness to box size will scale as rL,hot/ rj, as
indeed it is observed. A long thin current sheet is expected to fragment into a chain of plasmoids/magnetic islands
(e.g., Uzdensky et al. 2010; Werner et al. 2016), when the length-to-thickness ratio is much larger than unity. It follows
that all the cases in the right column will display a similar tendency for fragmentation (and in particular, they do not
appreciably fragment), whereas the likelihood of fragmentation is expected to increase from top to bottom in the left
column. In fact, for the case with rj/rL,hot = 245 (left bottom panel), a number of small-scale plasmoids appear in

ropes (i.e., when the electric energy peaks, as indicated by the vertical dotted lines in Fig. 69) from a suite of PIC
simulations. The evolution is driven with a velocity vpush/c = 0.1. In the left column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and
σin = 11 and we vary the ratio rj/rL,hot, from 31 to 245 (from top to bottom). In the right column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4
and rj/rL,hot = 61 and we vary the magnetization σin, from 3 to 170 (from top to bottom). In all cases, the simulation
box is a rectangle of size 5 rj × 3 rj. The 2D structure of Bz in all cases is quite similar, apart from the fact that larger
rj/rL,hot tend to lead to a more pronounced fragmentation of the current sheet.

γth (cid:39) 1 + (ˆγ − 1)−1kT /mc2), for a suite of PIC simulations of Lundquist ropes (same runs as in Fig. 68). In all the
cases, the evolution is driven with a velocity vpush/c = 0.1. In the left column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and σin = 11
and we vary the ratio rj/rL,hot from 31 to 245 (from blue to red, as indicated in the legend). In the right column, we
ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and rj/rL,hot = 61 and we vary the magnetization σin from 3 to 170 (from blue to red, as indicated
in the legend). The maximum particle energy γmaxmc2 resulting from the merger increases for increasing rj/rL,hot at
ﬁxed σin (left column) and for increasing σin at ﬁxed rj/rL,hot. The dashed black line in the top panel shows that the
electric energy grows exponentially as ∝ exp (ct/ rj). The vertical dotted lines mark the time when the electric energy

σin (cid:29) 1, the secondary tearing mode discussed by Uzdensky et al. (2010) — that leads to current sheet fragmentation
— appears at rj/rL,hot (cid:38) 100, in the case of Lundquist ropes.25

In Fig. 69 we present the temporal evolution of the runs whose 2D structure is shown in Fig. 68. In the left column,
we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and σin = 11 and we vary the ratio rj/rL,hot, from 31 to 245 (from blue to red, as indicated
in the legend of the middle panel). In the right column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and rj/rL,hot = 61 and we vary the
magnetization σin, from 3 to 170 (from blue to red, as indicated in the legend of the middle panel). The top panels
show that the evolution of the electric energy (in units of the total initial energy) is similar for all the values of rj/rL,hot
and σin we explore. In particular, the electric energy grows approximately as ∝ exp (ct/ rj) in all the cases (compare
with the dashed black lines), and it peaks at ∼ 5% of the total initial energy. The only marginal exception is the

Fig. 70.— Particle spectrum at the time when the electric energy peaks, for a suite of PIC simulations of Lundquist
ropes (same runs as in Fig. 68 and Fig. 69). In all the cases, the evolution is driven with a velocity vpush/c = 0.1. In the
left column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and σin = 11 and we vary the ratio rj/rL,hot from 31 to 245 (from blue to red, as
indicated by the legend). In the right column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and rj/rL,hot = 61 and we vary the magnetization
σin from 3 to 170 (from blue to red, as indicated by the legend). The main plot shows γdN/dγ to emphasize the
particle content, whereas the inset presents γ2dN/dγ to highlight the energy census. The dotted black line is a power

law γdN/dγ ∝ γ−1, corresponding to equal energy content per decade (which would result in a ﬂat distribution in the
insets). The spectral hardness is not a sensitive function of the ratio rj/rL,hot, but it is strongly dependent on σin, with
higher magnetizations giving harder spectra, up to the saturation slope of −1.

trans-relativistic case σin = 3 and rj/rL,hot = 61 (blue line in the top right panel), whose peak value is slightly smaller,
due to the lower Alfv´en speed. The onset time of the instability is also nearly independent of σin (top right panel),
although the low-magnetization cases σin = 3 and 11 (blue and green lines) seem to be growing slightly later. As regard
to the dependence of the onset time on rj/rL,hot at ﬁxed σin, the top left panel in Fig. 69 shows that larger values
of rj/rL,hot tend to grow later, but the variation is only moderate (with the exception of the case with the smallest
rj/rL,hot = 31, blue line in the top left panel, that grows quite early).

The peak reconnection rate in all the cases we have explored is around vrec/c ∼ 0.2 − 0.3 (middle row in Fig. 69).
It marginally decreases with increasing rj/rL,hot (but we have veriﬁed that it saturates at vrec/c ∼ 0.25 in the limit
rj/rL,hot (cid:29) 1, see the middle left panel in Fig. 69), and it moderately increases with σin (especially as we transition
from the non-relativistic regime to the relativistic regime, but it saturates at vrec/c ∼ 0.3 in the limit σin (cid:29) 1, see the
middle right panel in Fig. 69). We had found similar values and trends for the peak reconnection rate in the case of
ABC collapse, see Sect.6.4.

In the evolution of the maximum particle Lorentz factor γmax (bottom row in Fig. 69), one can distinguish two
phases. At early times (ct/ rj ∼ 2.5), the increase in γmax is moderate, when reconnection is triggered in the central
region by the initial velocity push. At later times (ct/ rj ∼ 6), as the two magnetic ropes merge on a dynamical timescale,
the maximum particle Lorentz factor grows explosively. Following the same argument detailed in Sect.6.4, we estimate
that the high-energy cutoﬀ of the particle spectrum at the end of the merger event (which lasts for a few rj/c) should
scale as γmax/γth ∝ v2
recσin( rj/rL,hot). If the reconnection rate does not signiﬁcantly depend on σin, this
implies that γmax ∝ rj at ﬁxed σin. The trend for a steady increase of γmax with rj at ﬁxed σin is conﬁrmed in the

rec√σin rj ∝ v2

– 106 –

bottom left panel of Fig. 69, both at the ﬁnal time and at the peak time of the electric energy (which is slightly diﬀerent
among the four diﬀerent cases, see the vertical dotted colored lines).26 Similarly, if the reconnection rate does not
signiﬁcantly depend on rj/rL,hot, this implies that γmax ∝ σin at ﬁxed rj/rL,hot. This linear dependence of γmax on σin
is conﬁrmed in the bottom right panel of Fig. 69.

The dependence of the particle spectrum on rj/rL,hot and σin is illustrated in Fig. 70 (left and right panel, respec-
tively), where we present the particle energy distribution at the time when the electric energy peaks (as indicated by the
colored vertical dotted lines in Fig. 69). In the main panels we plot γdN/dγ, to emphasize the particle content, whereas
the insets show γ2dN/dγ, to highlight the energy census. The particle spectrum shows a pronounced non-thermal
component in all the cases, regardless of whether the secondary plasmoid instability is triggered or not in the current
sheets (the results presented in Fig. 70 correspond to the cases displayed in Fig. 68). This suggests that in our setup any
acceleration mechanism that relies on plasmoid mergers is not very important, but rather that the dominant source of
energy is direct acceleration by the reconnection electric ﬁeld, in analogy to what we had demonstrated for the solitary
X-point collapse and the ACB instability.

At the time when the electric energy peaks, most of the particles are still in the thermal component (at γ ∼ 1),
i.e., bulk heating is negligible. Yet, a dramatic event of particle acceleration is taking place, with a few lucky particles
accelerated much beyond the mean energy per particle ∼ γthσin/2 (for comparison, we point out that γth ∼ 1 and
σin = 11 for the cases in the left panel). At ﬁxed σin = 11 (left panel), we see that the high-energy spectral cutoﬀ scales
as γmax ∝ rj ( rj changes by a factor of two in between each pair of curves).27 On the other hand, at ﬁxed rj/rL,hot = 61
(right panel), we ﬁnd that γmax ∝ σin (σin changes by a factor of four in between each pair of curves).

The spectral hardness is primarily controlled by the average in-plane magnetization σin. The right panel in Fig. 70
shows that at ﬁxed rj/rL,hot the spectrum becomes systematically harder with increasing σin, approaching the asymptotic
shape γdN/dγ ∝ const found for plane-parallel steady-state reconnection in the limit of high magnetizations (Sironi &
Spitkovsky 2014; Guo et al. 2015; Werner et al. 2016). At large rj/rL,hot, the hard spectrum of the high-σin cases will
necessarily run into constraints of energy conservation (see Eq. (32)), unless the pressure feedback of the accelerated
particles onto the ﬂow structure ultimately leads to a spectral softening (in analogy to the case of cosmic ray modiﬁed
shocks, see Amato & Blasi 2006). This argument seems to be supported by the left panel in Fig. 70. At ﬁxed σin, the
left panel shows that the spectral slope is nearly insensitive to rj/rL,hot, but larger systems seem to lead to steeper
slopes, which possibly reconciles the increase in γmax with the argument of energy conservation illustrated in Eq. (32).

8.5.2. Dependence on the collision speed

So far, we have investigated the merger of Lundquist ﬂux ropes with a prescribed collision speed vpush/c = 0.1. In
Figs. 71 and 72, we explore the eﬀect of diﬀerent values of the driving speed on the temporal evolution of the merger
and the resulting particle spectrum, for a suite of four PIC simulations with ﬁxed kT /mc2 = 10−4, σin = 42 and
rj/rL,hot = 61, but diﬀerent magnitudes of vpush: vpush/c = 3 × 10−1 (blue), vpush/c = 10−1 (green), vpush/c = 3 × 10−2
(yellow) and vpush/c = 10−2 (red).

26The fact that the dependence appears slightly sub-linear is due to the fact that the reconnection rate is slightly larger for smaller rj/rL,hot.

27The fact that the dependence is a little shallower than linear is due to the fact that the reconnection rate, which enters in the full

expression γmax ∝ v2

recσin( rj/rL,hot), slightly decreases with increasing rj/rL,hot, as detailed above.

magnetic ropes. However, the subsequent evolution is remarkably independent of vpush, apart from an overall shift in
the onset time. In all the cases, the electric energy grows exponentially as ∝ exp (ct/ rj) (compare with the black dashed
line) until it peaks at ∼ 5 − 10% of the total initial energy (the time when the electric energy peaks is indicated with
the vertical colored dotted lines). The peak of electric energy corresponds to the most violent phase of merger, and it
shortly follows the peak time of the reconnection rate. As shown in the middle panel, the reconnection speed peaks at
vrec/c ∼ 0.2 − 0.3, with only a weak dependence on the driving speed vpush. Driven by fast reconnection during the
dynamical merger event, the maximum particle energy γmax grows explosively (bottom panel in Fig. 71), ultimately
reaching γmax/γth ∼ 103 regardless of the initial driving speed vpush. The initial phase of growth of γmax is sensitive to
the value of vpush, reaching higher values for larger vpush (compare the plateau at γmax//γth ∼ 102 in the green line at
ct/ rj ∼ 3 with the corresponding plateau at γmax//γth ∼ 5 in the red line at ct/ rj ∼ 12). In contrast, the temporal
proﬁle of γmax during the merger (i.e., shortly before the time indicated by the vertical dotted lines) is nearly indentical
in all the cases (apart from an overall time shift). Overall, the similarity of the diﬀerent curves in Fig. 71 conﬁrms
that the evolution during the dynamical merger event is driven by self-consistent large-scale electromagnetic stresses,
independently of the initial driving speed.

the initial vpush.

As a consequence, it is not surprising that the particle spectrum measured at the time when the electric energy
peaks (as indicated by the vertical colored lines in Fig. 71) bears no memory of the driving speed vpush. In fact, the four
curves in Fig. 72 nearly overlap (with the only marginal exception of the case with the largest vpush/c = 0.3, in blue).

8.6. PIC simulations of 2D ﬂux tube mergers: core-envelope ropes

The temporal evolution of the merger of two core-envelope ropes is shown in Fig. 73, which should be compared

units of rj/c and indicated in the grey boxes within each panel.

x + B2

For the core-envelope geometry, the initial in-plane magnetic ﬁeld is discontinuous at the interface x = 0 between
the two magnetic ropes. There, magnetic reconnection spontaneously starts since early times (in contrast to the case of
Lundquist ropes, where the system needs to be driven by hand with a prescribed velocity push). The ongoing steady-
state reconnection is manifested in Fig. 73 by the formation and subsequent ejection of small-scale plasmoids, as the
current sheet at x = 0 stretches up to a length ∼ 2 rj. So far (i.e., until ct/ rj ∼ 2), the cores of the two islands have not
signiﬁcantly moved (black line in the middle panel of Fig. 74, indicating the xc location of the center of the rightmost
island), the reconnection speed is small (around vrec/c ∼ 0.1, red line in the middle panel of Fig. 74) and no signiﬁcant
energy exchange has occurred from the ﬁelds to the particles (compare the in-plane magnetic energy, shown by the

rectangular domain of size 10 rj × 6 rj (but we only show a small region around the center). Spontaneous reconnection
at the interface between the two ﬂux ropes (i.e., around x = y = 0) creates an envelope of ﬁeld lines engulﬁng the
two islands, whose tension force causes them to merge on a dynamical time. This ﬁgure should be compared with the
force-free result in Fig. 60.

in γmax up to γmax/γth ∼ 20, before stalling. At this stage, the cores of the two islands have not signiﬁcantly moved
(black line in the middle panel). At ct/ rj ∼ 3, the tension force of the common envelope of ﬁeld lines starts pushing
the two islands toward each other (and the xc location of the rightmost rope decreases, see the middle panel), resulting
in a merger event occurring on a dynamical timescale. During the merger (at ct/ rj ∼ 4), the reconnection rate peaks
(red line in the middle panel), a fraction of the in-plane magnetic energy is transferred to the plasma (compare dashed
blue and solid red lines in the top panel), and particles are quickly accelerated up to γmax/γth ∼ 103 (bottom panel).

28As we have also pointed out for the case of Lundquist ropes, we remark that the energy balance described in the top panel of Fig. 74 is

(red line; or E, green line) and B,in (dashed blue line) will not change, whereas they will all decrease as compared to the total magnetic

signiﬁcant evolution before ct/ rj ∼ 2 is the reconnection-driven increase in the maximum particle Lorentz factor up to
γmax/γth ∼ 150 occurring at ct/ rj ∼ 0.5 (see the black line in the bottom panel of Fig. 74).

As a result of reconnection, an increasing number of ﬁeld lines, that initially closed around one of the ropes, are
now forming a common envelope around both magnetic islands. In analogy to the case of Lundquist ropes, the magnetic
tension force causes the two islands to approach and merge on a quick (dynamical) timescale, starting at ct/ rj ∼ 3 and
ending at ct/ rj ∼ 5 (see that the distance of the rightmost island from the center rapidly decreases, as indicated by the
black line in the middle panel of Fig. 74). The tension force drives the particles in the ﬂux ropes toward the center, with
a fast reconnection speed peaking at vrec/c ∼ 0.3 (red line in the middle panel of Fig. 74).29 In the reconnection layer
at x = 0, it is primarily the in-plane ﬁeld that gets dissipated (compare the dashed and solid blue lines in the top panel
of Fig. 74), driving an increase in the electric energy (green) and in the particle kinetic energy (red). In this phase of
evolution, the fraction of initial energy released to the particles is small (kin/tot(0) ∼ 0.1), but the particles advected
into the central X-point experience a dramatic episode of acceleration. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 74, the
cutoﬀ Lorentz factor γmax of the particle spectrum presents a dramatic evolution, increasing up to γmax/γth ∼ 103
within a couple of dynamical times. It is this phase of extremely fast particle acceleration that we associate with the
generation of the Crab ﬂares.

The two distinct evolutionary phases — the early stage governed by steady-state reconnection at the central current
sheet, and the subsequent dynamical merger driven by large-scale electromagnetic stresses — are clearly apparent in the
evolution of the particle energy spectrum (top panel in Fig. 75) and of the angle-averaged synchrotron emission (bottom
panel in Fig. 75). Steady-state reconnection in the central current sheet leads to fast particle acceleration at early times
(from black to light blue in the top panel).30 The particle energy spectrum then freezes (see the clustering of the light
blue and cyan lines, and compare with the phase at 1 (cid:46) ct/ rj (cid:46) 2.5 in the bottom panel of Fig. 74). Correspondingly,
the angle-averaged synchrotron spectrum stops evolving (see the clustering of the light blue and cyan lines in the bottom
panel). A second dramatic increase in the particle and emission spectral cutoﬀ (even more dramatic than the initial
growth) occurs between ct/ rj ∼ 3.5 and ct/ rj ∼ 4.5 (green to yellow curves in Fig. 75), and it directly corresponds to
the dynamical merger of the two magnetic ropes, driven by large-scale stresses. The particle spectrum quickly extends
up to γmax ∼ 103 (yellow lines in the top panel), and correspondigly the peak of the νLν emission spectrum shifts up
maxνB,in ∼ 106νB,in (yellow lines in the bottom panel). The system does not show any sign of evolution at times
to ∼ γ2
later than c/ rj ∼ 5 (see the clustering of the yellow to red lines). At late times, the high-energy spectrum approaches
a distribution of the form γdN/dγ ∝ γ−1 corresponding to equal energy content in each decade of γ (compare with the
dotted black line in the top panel). Consequently, the synchrotron spectrum approaches a power law with νLν ∝ ν1/2
(compare with the dotted black line in the bottom panel).

The particle distribution is signiﬁcantly anisotropic. In the top panel of Fig. 76, we plot the electron momentum
spectrum at the time when the electric energy peaks (see the vertical black dotted line in Fig. 74) along diﬀerent
directions, as indicated in the legend. The highest energy electrons are beamed along the direction y of the reconnection
outﬂow (blue lines) and along the direction +z anti-parallel to the accelerating electric ﬁeld (red solid line; positrons
will be beamed along −z, due to the opposite charge). This is consistent with our results for solitary X-point collapse in
Sect. 4.2 and for merger of Lundquist ropes presented above. Most of the anisotropy is to be attributed to the “kinetic
beaming” discussed by Cerutti et al. (2012c), rather than beaming associated with the bulk motion (which is only

29This value of the reconnection rate is roughly comparable to the results of Lundquist ropes.
30We point out that the spectral bump at γ ∼ 5 ∼ 0.5σin, which is apparent since early times and later evolves up to γ ∼ 10, is an artifact
of the core-envelope solution. In this geometry, both the azimuthal ﬁeld and the poloidal ﬁeld are discontinuous at the boundary of the ropes.
The discontinuity has to be sustained by the particles (everywhere around each rope), via their pressure and electric current. The system
self-consistently builds up the pressure and current by energizing a few particles, thereby producing the bump at γ ∼ 5.

marginally relativistic, see the inset in the top panel of Fig. 76). The anisotropy of the synchrotron emission (bottom
panel in Fig. 76) is consistent with the particle anisotropy illustrated in the top panel.

8.6.1. Dependence on the ﬂow conditions

We now investigate the dependence of our results on the magnetization σin and the ratio rj/rL,hot, where rL,hot =
√σin c/ωp. In Fig. 68, we present the 2D pattern of the out-of-plane ﬁeld Bz (in units of B0,in) during the most violent
phase of rope merger (i.e., when the electric energy peaks, as indicated by the vertical dotted lines in Fig. 78) from a suite
of PIC simulations in a rectangular domain of size 5 rj × 3 rj. In the left column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and σin = 11
and we vary the ratio rj/rL,hot, from 31 to 245 (from top to bottom). In the right column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and
rj/rL,hot = 61 and we vary the magnetization σin, from 3 to 170 (from top to bottom).

The 2D pattern of Bz presented in Fig. 77 shows that the merger proceeds in a similar way in all the runs. The only
diﬀerence is that larger rj/rL,hot lead to thinner current sheets, when ﬁxing σin (left column in Fig. 77). In the right
column, with rj/rL,hot ﬁxed, the thickness of the current sheet (∼ rL,hot) is a ﬁxed fraction of the box size. In contrast,
in the left column, the ratio of current sheet thickness to box size will scale as rL,hot/ rj, as indeed it is observed. The
tendency for fragmentation into secondary plasmoids is known to be an increasing function of the length-to-thickness
ratio (e.g., Uzdensky et al. 2010; Werner et al. 2016).
It follows that all the cases in the right column will display
a similar tendency for fragmentation (and in particular, they do not appreciably fragment), whereas the likelihood of
fragmentation is expected to increase from top to bottom in the left column. In fact, for the case with rj/rL,hot = 245
(left bottom panel), a number of small-scale plasmoids appear in the current sheets. We ﬁnd that as long as σin (cid:29) 1,
the secondary tearing mode discussed by Uzdensky et al. (2010) — that leads to current sheet fragmentation — appears
at rj/rL,hot (cid:38) 100, in the case of core-envelope ropes.31

In Fig. 78 we present the temporal evolution of the runs whose 2D structure is shown in Fig. 77. In the left column,
we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and σin = 11 and we vary the ratio rj/rL,hot, from 31 to 245 (from blue to red, as indicated
in the legend of the middle panel). In the right column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and rj/rL,hot = 61 and we vary the
magnetization σin, from 3 to 170 (from blue to red, as indicated in the legend of the middle panel). The top panels show
that the evolution of the electric energy (in units of the total initial energy) is similar for all the values of rj/rL,hot and
σin we explore. In particular, the electric energy grows approximately as ∝ exp (ct/ rj) in all the cases (compare with
the dashed black lines), and it peaks at ∼ 5 − 10% of the total initial energy. The onset time of the instability is also
nearly independent of σin (top right panel). As regard to the dependence of the onset time on rj/rL,hot at ﬁxed σin, the
top left panel in Fig. 78 shows that larger values of rj/rL,hot tend to grow later, but the variation is only moderate.

The peak reconnection rate in all the cases we have explored is around vrec/c ∼ 0.2 − 0.3 (middle row in Fig. 78).
It is nearly insensitive to σin (middle right panel in Fig. 78) and it marginally decreases with increasing rj/rL,hot (but
we have veriﬁed that it saturates at vrec/c ∼ 0.25 in the limit rj/rL,hot (cid:29) 1, see the middle left panel). We had found
similar values and trends for the peak reconnection rate in the case of ABC collapse, see Sect.6.4, and in the merger
of Lundquist ropes. This places our results on solid footing, since our main conclusions do not depend on the speciﬁc
properties of a given ﬁeld geometry.

In the evolution of the maximum particle Lorentz factor γmax (bottom row in Fig. 78), one can distinguish two
phases. At early times (ct/ rj ∼ 3), the increase in γmax is moderate, when reconnection proceeds in a steady state
fashion in the central region. At later times (ct/ rj ∼ 4.5), as the two magnetic ropes merge on a dynamical timescale,

31A similar result had been found for the case of ABC collapse, see Sect.6.4, and for the merger of Lundquist ropes.

PIC simulations. In the left column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and σin = 11 and we vary the ratio rj/rL,hot, from 31 to 245
(from top to bottom). In the right column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and rj/rL,hot = 61 and we vary the magnetization
σin, from 3 to 170 (from top to bottom).
In all cases, the simulation box is a rectangle of size 5 rj × 3 rj. The 2D
structure of Bz in all cases is quite similar, apart from the fact that larger rj/rL,hot tend to lead to a more pronounced
fragmentation of the current sheet.

γth (cid:39) 1 + (ˆγ − 1)−1kT /mc2), for a suite of PIC simulations of core-envelope ropes (same runs as in Fig. 77). In the
left column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and σin = 11 and we vary the ratio rj/rL,hot from 31 to 245 (from blue to red, as
indicated in the legend). In the right column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and rj/rL,hot = 61 and we vary the magnetization
σin from 3 to 170 (from blue to red, as indicated in the legend). The maximum particle energy γmaxmc2 resulting from
the merger increases for increasing rj/rL,hot at ﬁxed σin (left column) and for increasing σin at ﬁxed rj/rL,hot. The
dashed black line in the top panel shows that the electric energy grows exponentially as ∝ exp (ct/ rj). The vertical
dotted lines mark the time when the electric energy peaks (colors as described above).

the maximum particle Lorentz factor grows explosively. Following the same argument detailed in Sect.6.4 for the ABC
instability, we estimate that the high-energy cutoﬀ of the particle spectrum at the end of the merger event (which lasts
for a few rj/c) should scale as γmax/γth ∝ v2
recσin( rj/rL,hot). If the reconnection rate does not signiﬁcantly
depend on σin, this implies that γmax ∝ rj at ﬁxed σin. The trend for a steady increase of γmax with rj at ﬁxed σin is
conﬁrmed in the bottom left panel of Fig. 78, both at the ﬁnal time and at the peak time of the electric energy (which
is slightly diﬀerent among the four diﬀerent cases, see the vertical dotted colored lines).32 Similarly, if the reconnection
rate does not signiﬁcantly depend on rj/rL,hot, this implies that γmax ∝ σin at ﬁxed rj/rL,hot. This linear dependence of
γmax on σin is conﬁrmed in the bottom right panel of Fig. 78. Once again, these conclusions parallel closely our ﬁndings
for the instability of ABC structures and the merger of Lundquist ropes.

ropes (same runs as in Fig. 77 and Fig. 78). In the left column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4 and σin = 11 and we vary the
ratio rj/rL,hot from 31 to 245 (from blue to red, as indicated by the legend). In the right column, we ﬁx kT /mc2 = 10−4

census. The dotted black line is a power law γdN/dγ ∝ γ−1, corresponding to equal energy content per decade (which
would result in a ﬂat distribution in the insets). The spectral hardness is not a sensitive function of the ratio rj/rL,hot,
but it is strongly dependent on σin, with higher magnetizations giving harder spectra, up to the saturation slope of −1.

the colored vertical dotted lines in Fig. 78). In the main panels we plot γdN/dγ, to emphasize the particle content,
whereas the insets show γ2dN/dγ, to highlight the energy census.

At the time when the electric energy peaks, most of the particles are still in the thermal component (at γ ∼ 1),
i.e., bulk heating is negligible.33 Yet, a dramatic event of particle acceleration is taking place, and the particle spectrum
shows a pronounced non-thermal component, with a few lucky particles accelerated much beyond the mean energy per
particle ∼ γthσin/2 (for comparison, we point out that γth ∼ 1 and σin = 11 for the cases in the left panel). The
spectral hardness is primarily controlled by the average in-plane magnetization σin. The right panel in Fig. 79 shows
that at ﬁxed rj/rL,hot the spectrum becomes systematically harder with increasing σin, approaching the asymptotic
shape γdN/dγ ∝ const found for plane-parallel steady-state reconnection in the limit of high magnetizations (Sironi &
Spitkovsky 2014; Guo et al. 2015; Werner et al. 2016). At large rj/rL,hot, the hard spectrum of the high-σin cases will
necessarily run into constraints of energy conservation (see Eq. (32)), unless the pressure feedback of the accelerated
particles onto the ﬂow structure ultimately leads to a spectral softening (in analogy to the case of cosmic ray modiﬁed
shocks, see Amato & Blasi 2006). This argument seems to be supported by the left panel in Fig. 79. At ﬁxed σin, the
left panel shows that larger systems (i.e., larger rj/rL,hot) lead to systematically steeper slopes, which possibly reconciles
the increase in γmax with the argument of energy conservation illustrated in Eq. (32).

In application to the GeV ﬂares of the Crab Nebula, which we attribute to the dynamical phase of rope merger

33As we have explained above, the low-energy bump at γ ∼ σin/2 visible in the yellow and red curves on the right panel of Fig. 79 is due

to hot particles at the boundaries of the ropes, where the initial ﬁelds are sharply discontinuous.

(either Lundquist ropes or core-envelope ropes), we envision an optimal value of σin between ∼ 10 and ∼ 100. Based
on our results, smaller σin (cid:46) 10 would correspond to smaller reconnection speeds (in units of the speed of light), and
so weaker accelerating electric ﬁelds. On the other hand, σin (cid:38) 100 would give hard spectra with slopes s < 2, which
would prohibit particle acceleration up to γmax (cid:29) γth without violating energy conservation (for the sake of simplicity,
here we ignore the potential spectral softening at high σin and large rj/rL,hot discussed above).

8.7. Merger of two ﬂux tubes: conclusion

In this section we have conducted a number of numerical simulations of merging ﬂux tubes with zero poloidal
current. The key diﬀerence between this case and the 2D ABC structures, §6, is that two zero-current ﬂux tubes
immersed either in external magnetic ﬁeld or external plasma represent a stable conﬁguration, in contrast with the
unstable 2D ABC structures. Two barely touching ﬂux tubes, basically, do not evolve - there is no large scale stresses
that force the islands to merge. When the two ﬂux tubes are pushed together, the initial evolution depends on the
transient character of the initial conditions.

In all the diﬀerent conﬁgurations that we investigated the evolution proceeded according to the similar scenario:
initially, perturbation lead to the reconnection of outer ﬁeld lines and the formation of common envelope. This initial
stage of the merger proceeds very slowly, driven by resistive eﬀects. With time the envelope grew in size and a common
magnetic envelope develops around the cores. The dynamics changes when the two cores of the ﬂux tube (which carry
parallel currents) come into contact. Starting this moment the evolution of the two merging cores resembles the evolution
of the current-carrying ﬂux tubes in the case of 2D ABC structures: the cores start to merge explosively and, similarly,
later balanced by the forming current sheet. Similar to the 2D ABC case, the fastest rate of particle acceleration occurs
at this moment of fast dynamic merger.

Thus, in the second stage of the ﬂux tubes merger the dynamics is determined mostly by the properties of the
cores, and not the details of the initial conditions (e.g., how ﬂux tubes are pushed together). Also, particle acceleration
proceeds here in a qualitatively similar way as in the case of 2D ABC structure - this is expected since the cores of
merging ﬂux tubes do carry parallel currents that attract, similar to the 2D ABC case.

9. The model of Crab Nebula ﬂares

Based on the above discussion we develop a model of Crab ﬂares that satisﬁes the following criteria: (i) particle
acceleration should proceed very fast, with the accelerating electric ﬁeld of the order of the magnetic ﬁeld; (ii) re-
connection region is macroscopically large, not related to the plasma microscopic parameters like the skin depth; (iii)
only a relatively small number of particles are accelerated to the full potential available within the acceleration region
(otherwise γ ≤ σw). These are three very demanding criteria.

9.1. Available potential in the wind

Let us ﬁrst give order-of-magnitude estimates of the overall size and the location of the ﬂare emission region. Taking
the variability time scale of τf ∼ 1 day (Tavani et al. 2011; Abdo et al. 2011) as representative of the size of the emission
region, we can estimate the distance of the emission region from the pulsar based on the measured parameters of the
Crab pulsar and this variability time scale.

The magnetic ﬁeld in the wind (Michel 1973) scales as (below we use basic order-of-magnitude estimates, for more

detailed discussion see, e.g., Bogovalov 1999; Tchekhovskoy et al. 2016)

If the emission region is located between two ﬂux surfaces θ1 and θ2, the value of potential diﬀerence ∆Φ = Φ(θ2)−Φ(θ1)
can be used to estimate the maximal accelerating potential within the region. For radial ﬂow the potential diﬀerence
between two magnetic ﬂux surfaces is independent of the distance from pulsar – we can use the scaling of the potential

(49) to estimate the angular extent of the emission region as seen from the pulsar. For Crab pulsar with ˙E = 4 × 1038

The potential (49) is not easily accessible for the particles advected with the wind - in order to get accelerated
a particle needs to cross between diﬀerent magnetic ﬂux surfaces. To do this, the wind ﬁrst needs to be decelerated
to non-relativistic velocities (otherwise a causally connected region has only a small fraction of the total potential, of
the order 1/γw), and, second non-ideal process should allow a particle to cross the ﬂux surfaces. The ﬂow deceleration
occurs at the oblique termination shock and subsequent evolution ﬂow evolution (Komissarov & Lyubarsky 2003; Porth
et al. 2014a). As we discuss next, the post-shock ﬂow evolution leads to natural formation of highly magnetized regions
in the bulk of the nebula (see §2 for the discussion of corresponding large scale simulations)

9.2. Post-shock ﬂow - formation of highly magnetized regions

To understand the formation of highly magnetized regions starting with only mildly magnetized conditions at the
reverse shock, Fig. 1, let us consider the post oblique shock evolution of the wind. Let the wind magnetization be

σw (cid:38) 1, Eq. (51), and wind Lorentz factor γw (cid:29) 1. Let us consider evolution of plasma magnetization in the post-shock

ﬂow. Magnetization ﬁrst changes at the shock. As a guide we can use solutions for the normal shocks (Kennel & Coroniti
1984) - in oblique relativistic shocks the compression ratio diﬀers considerably from that of the normal shock only for
very small angles of attack (see, e.g., Fig. A2 of Lyutikov et al. 2016). In the σw (cid:29) 1 case the post-shock magnetization
parameter, deﬁned in terms of the ratio of the magnetic energy to plasma enthalpy, is σ = 2σw, while typical thermal
Lorentz factor is γT ≈ γw/(8√σw) (Kennel & Coroniti 1984; P´etri & Lyubarsky 2007b). Note, that magnetization

increases at the shock - σ is the measure of the ratio of the magnetic energy density to plasma energy density in
the ﬂow frame; in a highly magnetized strong shock the rest-frame magnetic ﬁeld increases due to ﬂow deceleration
(observer-frame magnetic ﬁeld remains nearly the same). This increase if rest-frame magnetic ﬁeld over-compensates

the dissipated part of the magnetic energy. At the same time the post-shock Lorentz factor is γ2 ∼ √σw/ sin δ1, where
δ1 ∼ 0.1 − 0.5 is the angle of attack. This value can reach ∼ tens for σw ≥ 100; as a conservative lower limit let us use
γ2 ≥ 10.

As a highly relativistic, γ2 (cid:29) 1 ﬂow propagates into the nebula, it is decelerated by the nebular material. As long as
it remains relativistic, the ﬂow remains nearly radial (also, for σ (cid:29) 1 the deﬂection angle at the shock is small Lyutikov
et al. 2012, 2016). As a result of deceleration the magnetic ﬁeld is further ampliﬁed within the nebula (the Cranﬁll eﬀect
Cranﬁll 1974), leading to formation of high-σ regions even for mild pre-shock magnetization.

The increased magnetization regions within the nebula are clearly seen in numerical simulations. For example, in
Fig. 1 we show plasma magnetization in simulations of Porth et al. (2014a). A high σ region originates from smaller σ
parts of the wind (in the simulations that part of the wind has σw = 3), then σ gets ampliﬁed at the shock, and later on
it gets even more ampliﬁed in the bulk. At the same time the bulk Lorentz factor decreases, while the ﬂow trajectory
becomes substantially non-radial. Thus, creation of highly magnetized regions, even starting from mildly magnetized
ﬂows, is a natural consequence of ﬂow evolution within the nebula.

Guided by the results of the numerical simulations (which used mild magnetization and wind Lorentz factors Porth
et al. 2013), we can estimate the general behavior of the post-shock ﬂow. Simulations show that, approximately, in
doubling the radius, the ﬂow decelerates from highly relativistic post-shock value, γ2 (cid:29) 1, to a non-relativistic one
v/c ∼ 0.1, while the enthalpy drops by a factor of a few. This must results in a huge increase of the rest-frame magnetic
ﬁeld and plasma magnetization, as we discuss next. From the induction equation BΓrv ≈ constant for quasi-stationary
radial ﬂow, the magnetic ﬁeld Bf in the ﬂare region can be estimated as

(cid:18) rs

(cid:19)(cid:18) c

(cid:19)

where rs is a shock radius along a given ﬂow line, B2 is a value of the magnetic ﬁeld at the shock, Γ2 is the immediate

(53)

post-shock Lorentz factor; Bf , rf , vf are evaluated in the ﬂare region. Since rf /rs ∼ 2, while Γ2 ≈ √σw/δ1 (cid:29) 1 and
c/vf ∼ few, we ﬁnd that the rest-frame magnetic ﬁeld in the ﬂare region may exceeds the values at the shock. At the
same time, density (from ρΓr2v ≈ constant) is

Γ2ρs.

For relativistic ﬂuid with adiabatic index of 4/3 the magnetization in the ﬂare region is then related to the magnetization
at the shock σ2 and in the wind σw as

σf =

Γ2/3
2 σ2

(55)

(here σ is deﬁned as the ratio of two times the magnetic energy to enthalpy, assuming highly relativistic EoS). All factors
in Eq. (55) in front of the shock magnetization parameter σ2 are larger than unity, thus σf (cid:29) σ2. Thus, even for σw ∼
few, there is strong ampliﬁcation of σ right at the shock (by as much as a factor of 2, σ2 ∼ 2σw), and then another
ampliﬁcation in the bulk, σf (cid:29) σ2.

Based on the above discussion, we expect that in the post-shock ﬂow the magnetization may increase by a large value.
Though the above considerations are approximate, and neglect a number of important details (most importantly, the
development of non-radial and non-axisymmetric velocity ﬁeld), the expected eﬀect - a large growth of the magnetization,
is huge. Thus, we conclude that highly magnetized structures are naturally formed in the post-shock ﬂow.

9.3. Relativistic boosting of the emission

The emission resulting in the Crab ﬂares needs to be relativistically boosted by a factor of a few. The main argument
in favor of the relativistic bulk motion of the emitters is the fact that the peak energy of ﬂares, 400 MeVs, exceeds by
a factor of a few the absolute synchrotron limit, Eq. (1). (In this context, Clausen-Brown & Lyutikov (2012) discussed
a ﬂare model based on the idea of randomly oriented mini-jets - ﬂares’ emission is beamed by relativistically moving
emission sites. A strong increase in the observed ﬂux is seen only when the beaming is directed towards the observer.)
Cerutti et al. (2012b,c) discussed a related eﬀect: directed acceleration of the particles along the neutral current sheet
– kinetic beaming. As we discuss next, bulk motion of the emitting plasma is important not only for the high spectral
peak of the ﬂare emission, but also to account for the energy budget of ﬂares, see §9.4 and Eq. (62).

Our simulations also show the eﬀect of kinetic beaming - the highest energy particles are highly anisotropic, e.g.,
in X-point collapse (§4.2.4 and Fig. 20) and ﬂux tube mergers, §8.4. In case of 2D ABC structures, §6.4.2, particle
isotropy is due to averaging over the simulation volume that contains many reconnection sheets (and, in some sense, an
artiﬁcial consequence of the idealized ABC geometry).

As a qualitative estimate of the anisotropy of the highest energy particles we can use the scaling of the outﬂow
Lorentz factor in a relativistic Petschek-type reconnection (Lyubarsky 2005), see also Lyutikov & Uzdensky (2003),

Γ ∼ √σ ≈ 10 − 20 for the preferred values of the magnetization in the emission region of σ = 100 − 500. We stress

that Clausen-Brown & Lyutikov (2012) used this estimate as an educated guess, while in the present study this scaling
comes from the PIC simulations.

9.4. Radiation physics

Let us consider synchrotron radiation by particles moving with bulk Lorentz factor Γ with respect to the observer.
(See §9.3 for the discussion of the origin of bulk motion in the nebula). To be on the conservative side, we scale the

– 123 –

relations to the bulk Lorentz factor of Γ = 5. Let us assume that the observed ﬂare duration τf ∼ 1 day is limited by
synchrotron losses. In the frame moving with the ﬂow the synchrotron losses occur on time scale τ(cid:48)
f (values measured
int he rest frame are denoted with prime).

(56)
where γ(cid:48) is the typical Lorentz factor of the emitting particles in the ﬂow rest frame. In the observer frame the loss
time is Γ times larger, but the observed duration will be ≈ 1/(2Γ2) shorter (assuming motion along the line of sight),

9.5. Emission region: size, location and microphysical parameters

Combining estimate of the magnetic ﬁeld in the emission region (59) with the scaling in the wind, Eq. (47), we ﬁnd

the distance of the ﬂare site from the pulsar:

f Ω2 = 2 × 1016(Γ/5)−5/3cm

(60)

(compare with Fig. 1 - the highly magnetized region is indeed located within the nebula at distances few ×1016 cm).
The angular size of the emission region, as seen from the pulsar, is

γ(cid:48)
γmax ∼ few × 10−2(Γ/5)−1/3 sin−2 θ/2

∆θ ≥

(61)

This implies that the emission region cannot be too close to the axis, θ ≥ 0.3(Γ/5)−1/6 (otherwise, since the ﬁeld is

small near the axis, there is not enough potential to accelerate the particles to the needed energy).

We conclude that the emission region is located at intermediate polar angles, not too close to the axis; it occupies a
size comparable to the distance to the axis. (If emission region is located new the equator, its size is about 0.05(Γ/5)−1/6
of the distance to the pulsar.) These estimates nicely agree with the location of highly magnetized region deduced in
large scale numerical simulations, Fig. 1.

Using the estimates above, the total energy within the emitting volume is

EB = (4π/3)

B2
8π

(cτf )3(2Γ2) ∼ 8 × 1041(Γ/5)10/3erg

(62)

– 124 –

The factor (2Γ2) appears because the size of the emitting region along the line of sight (and along its motion) is larger
that cτf . This is comparable to the total observed ﬂare energetics of ∼ 1041 erg (Tavani et al. 2011; Abdo et al. 2011).
The estimate (62) is an important one: without relativistic boosting there is not enough energy within the emitting
volume to power the ﬂares - relativistic boost is needed. Even for a fairly mild boost of Γ ∼ 5 the available energy
budget increases by a factor Γ10/3 ∼ 200.

We can also estimate the total number of particles producing a ﬂare. Assuming that emission occurs in the

radiation-reaction limited regime, the luminosity in the frame of the blob is

(cid:48) = Nem
L

γmec2

τ(cid:48)

f

(63)

where Nem is the goal number of particles participating in the emission and τ(cid:48)
f = 2Γτf is the ﬂare duration in the blob’s
frame. The observed luminosity L ≈ (2Γ)3L(cid:48). For the peak isotropic γ-ray luminosity of Lγ ∼ 1036 erg s−1 (Tavani et

al. 2011; Abdo et al. 2011) the number of emitting particles is then

Nem = 3 × 1035L36(Γ/5)−5/3

(64)

The number of particles required to produce a ﬂare, Eq. (64) the pulsar produces within less than a second, see Eq.
(52)

We can also verify that the total number of particles within volume (cτf )3 is much larger that the estimate (64):

Ntot = (cτf )3

˙N
4πcr2 = 4 × 1040(Γ/5)10/3λ4

(65)

Thus, only a small fraction of particles within the emission volume needs to be accelerated to the terminal Lorentz
factor.

This is an important result: only a small relative number of partciles is needed to produce a ﬂare. If all particles
within a region are accelerated, the terminal Lorentz factor is limited by the magnetization of the wind, (51), γmax ≤ σw.
Since the required Lorentz factors of the emitting particles is γ ∼ 109, it would then require σw ≥ 109 - an unreasonable
constraint.

9.6. Microphysical parameters in the emission zone: acceleration region is macroscopic

Next, let us estimate the microphysical parameters in the emission region. The key point that we would like to make
is that the acceleration should occur on macroscopic scales, not related to the plasma skin depth. Since the concluding
inequality is strong (Eq. 69) we neglect factors of a few.

Consider a high-σ shock (for simplicity, we neglect the eﬀects of the angle of attack) located at radius r from the
pulsar. For the wind Lorentz factor γw and magnetization σw the post-shock rest-frame density and magnetic ﬁeld
follow from conservation of mass ﬂux and induction equation,

The maximal Lorentz factor that a particle can achieve on a skin depth scale is then

(69)

The current models of pair production in the pulsar magnetosphere predict λ ∼ 104 (Arons & Scharlemann 1979;
Daugherty & Harding 1982; Cheng et al. 2000) (the model of Crab Nebula emission require λ ∼ 106 (Shklovsky 1970)).
The typical magnetization of the pulsar wind σw ∼ 103 − 106. Thus, the maximal Lorentz factor that can be reached
on microscopic scales, of the order of the skin depth, is much smaller than required by observations, Eq. (59), by many
orders of magnitude.
(It may also be demonstrated that this conclusion does not change if we take into account the
post-shock evolution of the ﬂow.)

We conclude that acceleration of particles producing Crab ﬂares occurs on spacial scales many orders of magnitude
larger than the plasma skin depth. This is an important result. In our view it is inconsistent with the reconnection
processes occurring during the development of the tearing mode (Cerutti et al. 2012a,c) in collisionless plasmas, since
the typical scale of a current sheet that collisionless tearing mode creates is of the order of the skin depths. The size of
plasmoids, at late times can reach 100s of skin depths, but the reconnection rate at those times becomes small, especially
in the realistic 3D geometry (Sironi & Spitkovsky 2014).

Our PIC simulations indicate that the spectrum of the accelerated particles depend on the overall magnetization.

This introduces an important constraint on the plasma parameters in the acceleration region that we discuss next.

9.7. Maximal Lorentz factor

If the spectrum of accelerated particles is soft, p > 2, most of the energy of the non-thermal particles is concentrated
at lower energies; in this case there is no limit on the possible highest energy of a particle. Our PIC simulations indicate
that p > 2 requires that the plasma magnetization in the emission region be not too high σ ≤ 100. For higher σ the
particle spectrum is hard, p < 2. Since magnetization increases both at the shock front and during the post-shock ﬂow
evolution, the corresponding requirement on the wind magnetization is σw ≤ 10; this value is well below what models of
particle acceleration in pulsar magnetospheres predict (Arons & Scharlemann 1979; Daugherty & Harding 1982; Cheng
et al. 2000). Regions of higher magnetization will produce ﬂatter spectra, 1 < p < 2, so that the density is dominated
by the low energy particles, while the energy is dominated by the high energy particles. Flatter spectra run into energy
limitation: the maximal energy of a particle is limited from above. Assuming that the initial magnetic energy per
particle (magnetization) is σ/2 and the initial typical Lorentz factor is γT , the maximal energy is (see Eq. (32), Sironi
& Spitkovsky (2011b))

– 126 –

Let us next do the estimate of the parameters of the wind required to accelerate particles to γmax ∼ 5 × 109. Let
the wind Lorentz factor and magnetization be γw, σw (cid:29) 1. Immediately after the oblique shock magnetization increases
σ2 = 2σw while particles are heated to γT = γw/√σw. The post oblique shock bulk Lorentz factor is γ2 = √σw/ sin δ1
(δ1 ≈ 0.3 is the angle of attack). Further in the emission region σf is related to σ2 by Eq. (55). Estimating σf = ηf σ2,
ηf (cid:29) 1, neglecting mild adiabatic compression in the decelerating post-shock ﬂow, and assuming power-law index
p = 3/2 (so that γmax ≈ γT σ2

(71)
For example for σw = 50, ηf = 5, γw = 106, we ﬁnd γmax = 4.5×109, suﬃcient to explain γ-ray ﬂares. The corresponding
magnetization in the emission region is σf = 500. The value of σf is only somewhat larger our best case scenario for
magnetization σ ∼ 100.

γmax = (1/2)γwη2

Importantly, these estimates show that γ-ray ﬂares come from parts of the wind that is not extremely highly
magnetized σw ∼ 10 − 100 (otherwise the increase of σ at the shock and further increase in the pos-shock ﬂow would
create regions with magnetization well exceeding our best case scenario, so that the resulting spectra will be hard and
the maximal Lorentz factor will be low.) This value of magnetization is lower than predicted by the pair formation
models (Arons & Scharlemann 1979; Daugherty & Harding 1982; Cheng et al. 2000). It is not clear whether the models
underestimate the pair formation multiplicity, or if the highly magnetized sections of the wind mix downstream of the
termination shock with the lower magnetized parts.

9.8. Potential-Luminosity relationship and the Alfv´en current

There is important, yet somewhat subtle, relationship between the parameters of the ﬂares that serve as a conﬁr-
mation of the basic principles of our approach. Qualitatively, the electromagnetic power of relativistic outﬂows can be
estimated as (Blandford & Znajek 1977; Blandford 2002)

where V is a typical values of the electric potential produced by the central engine and R ≈ 1/c is the impedance of
free space. In case of Crab ﬂares, the available potential,

LEM ≈ V 2/R
(cid:112)

V ∼

L/c ≈ 1.7 × 1015 V,

corresponds to γ ≈ 3.4 × 109 - very close to the estimate (59).

Similarly, the electric current associated with ﬂares

√Lc ≈ 5 × 1022 cgs units = 1.7 × 1013 Ampers

I ≈

is similar to the (relativistic) Alfv´en current (Alfv´en 1939; Lawson 1973) for the required Lorentz factor (59):

IA = γ

mec3

e

= 1.7 × 1023, cgs units = 6 × 1013 Ampers

This is important: the Lorentz factor that we derived from radiation modeling (from the peak energy and duration
of ﬂares) nearly coincides with the expected Lorentz factor of particles derived from the assumption that the radiated
power is similar to the intrinsic electromagnetic power of ﬂares.
In a related “coincidence”, the current required to

– 127 –

produce a given luminosity nearly coincides with the corresponding Alfv´en current, calculated using the Lorentz factor
of the emitting particles.

These coincidences, in our view, are not accidental: they imply that ﬂares are produced by charge-separated ﬂow.
This is indeed expected in the acceleration models based on DC-type acceleration. This is also consistent with our PIC
simulation that show eﬀects of kinetic beaming - highly anisotropic distribution of the highest energy particles.

10. Discussion

In this paper we developed models of particle acceleration during explosive reconnection events in highly magnetized

plasma and applied the results to explain the origin of Crab Nebula ﬂares.

There is a number of important basic plasma physics results.

X-point collapse in highly magnetized plasma. We extended to the new regime, that of a highly magnetized plasma,
the concept of explosive current sheet formations during catastrophic X-point collapse (Sweet 1969; Imshennik
& Syrovatskivi 1967; Syrovatskii 1981). Analytical results were cross-checked with force-free, MHD and PIC
simulations. We ﬁnd that the reconnection rates in our set-ups are typically much higher than in the plane-
parallel cases due to large-scale magnetic forces. A key feature of the relativistic case is that macroscopically large
regions with E ∼ B appear. It is in these specials regions that particles are eﬃciently accelerated by charge-starved
electric ﬁelds(see below).

Instability of 2D magnetic ABC structures. We have studied the instability of the 2D magnetic ABC structures
and identiﬁed two main instability modes (see also East et al. 2015). The instability is of the kind “parallel
currents attract”. (Parker 1983; Longcope & Strauss 1994, considered a similar model problem for the magnetic
ﬁeld structure of the Solar corona and generation of Solar ﬂares.) We identiﬁed two stages of the instability -
(i) the explosive stage, when the accelerating electric ﬁelds reach values close to the magnetic ﬁelds, but little
magnetic energy is dissipated; the most important process during this stage is the X-point collapse; (ii) slower,
forced reconnection stage, whereas a large fraction of the initial magnetic ﬁeld energy is dissipated; at this stage
the newly formed central current sheet repels the attracting currents. Though the model is highly idealized, it
illustrates two important concepts: (i) that ubiquitous magnetic null lines (e.g., Albright 1999) serve as sites of
current sheet formation, dissipation of magnetic energy and particle acceleration; (ii) that the evolution is driven
by large-scale magnetic stresses. The case of 2D ABC structures is diﬀerent from the 3D ABC, which is stable
(Moﬀatt 1986).

Triggered collapse of 2D ABC structures. We have studied a number of set-ups that greatly accelerate the development
of the instability of 2D ABC structures - either by a inhomogeneous large-scale compression or by a strong fast-
mode wave. Large-scale perturbations can greatly speed-up the development of instability.

Collision of magnetic ﬂux tubes. We have discussed the merger of magnetic ﬂux tubes carrying no net electric current.
In
In this case the tubes ﬁrst develop a common envelope via resistive evolution and then merge explosively.
comparison to two stages of the merger of current-carrying ﬂux tubes the zero-current ﬂux tubes have in addition
a slow initial stage of development of the common envelope.

Particle acceleration: diﬀerent stages. We have discussed intensively the properties of particle acceleration during the
X-point collapse, during the development of the 2D ABC instability and during the merger of ﬂux tube with
zero total current. These three diﬀerent set-ups allow us to concentrate on somewhat diﬀerent aspects of particle
acceleration. In all the cases that we investigated the eﬃcient particle acceleration always occurs in the region with
E ≥ B - by the charge-starved electric ﬁelds. This stage is best probed with the X-point collapse simulations. In
the case of ABC structures and ﬂux tube mergers the most eﬃciently particles are accelerated during the initial
explosive stage; during that stage not much of magnetic energy is dissipated. In case of 2D ABC system, this initial
stage of rapid acceleration is followed by a forced reconnection stage; at this stage particles are further accelerated
to higher energies, but the rate of acceleration is low. In case of the colliding/merging zero-current ﬂux tubes, the
fast dynamic stage is preceded by the slow resistive stage, when the outer ﬁeld lines form an overlaying shroud that
pushes the parallel current-carrying cores together. When these parallel current-carrying cores come in contact

– 129 –

the evolution proceeds similarly to the unstable ABC case. We stress that the fastest particle acceleration occurs
in the beginning of the dynamical stage of the merger (right away in the X-point collapse simulations, in the initial
stage of the instability of the ABC conﬁguration, after the slow resistive evolution in case of colliding/merging
ﬂux tubes).

Reconnection rates. The key advantage of the suggested model, if compared with the plane parallel case (that mostly
invokes tearing mode Uzdensky et al. 2011; Cerutti et al. 2012a,c, 2013), is that macroscopic large scale magnetic
stresses lead to much higher reconnection rate and much faster particle acceleration. Speciﬁcally, the dynamics
stage, associated with the X-point collapse, produces exceptionally high reconnection/acceleration rates, as large
as ∼ 0.8; most importantly, this occurs over macroscopic spacial scales. This high acceleration rate is nearly an
order of magnitude larger than is achieved in plane-parallel tearing mode-based models.

Particle acceleration: particle spectra and bulk magnetization.

In all the cases we investigated the power-law slope
of particle distribution depends on magnetization: higher σ produce harder spectra. The critical case of p = 2
corresponds approximately to σ ≤ 100. For p ≥ 2 the maximal energy that particles can achieve grows linearly
with the size of the acceleration region. In the regime 100 ≤ σ ≤ 1000 particle spectra indices are p < 2, yet the
maximal energy can still exceed σ by orders of magnitude. For very large σ ≥ 103 the spectrum becomes hard,
p → 1, so that the maximal energy is limited by γp,max ≤ σ. For small σ ≤ few the acceleration rate becomes
slow, non-relativistic (see also Werner et al. 2016).

Anisotropy of accelerated particles. In all the cases we investigated the distribution of accelerated particles, especially
those with highest energy, turned out to be highly anisotropic. Since the highest energy particles have large Larmor
radii, this anisotropy is kinetic; qualitatively it resembles beaming along the magnetic null line (and the direction
of accelerating electric ﬁeld). Importantly, this kinetic anisotropy shows on macroscopic scales.

We apply the above listed results to explain the origin of Crab Nebula γ-ray ﬂares. Our model of Crab ﬂares has a

number of key features, that are both required by observations and/or have not been previously explored.

Acceleration mechanism. We argued that the particles producing Crab ﬂares are accelerated in explosive magnetic
reconnection events. This is, arguably, the ﬁrst solidly established case in high energy astrophysics of direct ac-
celeration in reconnection events (as opposed to shock acceleration). In addition, since in our mode the maximal
energy that particles can achieve grows with the size of the acceleration region, it is possible that smaller reconnec-
tion events are responsible for the acceleration of the majority of high-energy emitting particles in the Crab Nebula;
shock acceleration does work - producing the Crab inner knot (Lyutikov et al. 2016) - but it may be subdominant
for the acceleration of high energy particles.

Location of ﬂares. The ﬂare-producing region is located at polar intermediate latitudes, between 10 and ∼ 45 degrees,
where the wind magnetization is expected to be high (the lower limit on the ﬂare latitude comes from available
required potential, Eq. (61), while upper limit comes from modeling of the Crab inner knot Lyutikov et al. (2016)).
The sectors of the wind that eventually become the acceleration sites for ﬂare particle have mild magnetization,
σw ∼ 10 − 100. Magnetization ﬁrst increases at the oblique termination shock and later in the bulk, during the
deceleration of the mildly relativistic post-shock ﬂow, Fig. 1. As the ﬂow decelerates to sub-relativistic velocities,
large scale kink instabilities lead to formation of current-carrying ﬂux tubes, Fig. 3. We hypothesize that the
ensuing evolution of ﬂux tubes is captured by our model problems considered in §6 - 8 - current-carrying ﬂux tubes
are attracted and merge explosively.

Size of the accelerating region. In our model the acceleration occurs on macroscopic scales, not related to the plasma
microscopic scales, like the skin depth. (Previous models of reconnection in Crab ﬂares, e.g., Cerutti et al. 2012a,c,

– 130 –

were based on the development of the tearing mode and achieved acceleration on scale related to the skin depth -
there is not enough potential on scales of few skin depths to account for Crab ﬂares.)

Relativistic beaming motion of the ﬂare producing region. The peak frequency of ﬂares, the energy and the energetics of
ﬂares all require mildly relativistic “bulk” motion of the ﬂare producing particles, with Γ ∼ few. This is achieved
via “kinetic beaming”, and not through a genuine, ﬂuid-like bulk motion of the lower energy component.)

Implication for other high energy sources: acceleration by shocks and/or magnetic reconnection

The Crab Nebula is the paragon of the high energy astrophysical source. Understanding physical processes operating
in the Crab has enormous implications for high energy astrophysics in general. Many models of Active Galactic Nuclei
and Gamma Ray Bursts use the unipolar inductor paradigm - they are driven by highly magnetized rotating compact
sources (e.g., Blandford & Znajek 1977; Usov 1992; Lyutikov 2006b; Komissarov & Barkov 2007; Thompson et al.
2004). In case of AGN jets acceleration of particles in reconnection events, and at shocks, might play an important role
in jet emission (Blandford 2002; Lyutikov 2003b; Uzdensky 2011; Sironi et al. 2015). Similarly, in case of Gamma-Ray
Bursts particles might be accelerated via reconnection events (Lyutikov et al. 2003; Lyutikov 2006b). Possibly, high
energy ﬂares in AGNs as well as spikes in GRBs’ proﬁles may resemble the ﬂares from the Crab Nebula, as discussed by
Lyutikov (2006a); Giannios et al. (2010); Clausen-Brown & Lyutikov (2012). Thus, the reconnection models developed
here for the particular case of Crab Nebula might be applicable to magnetized jets of Active Galactic Nuclei and Gamma
Ray Bursts.

These results further strengthen the argument that particles producing Crab ﬂares, and possibly most of the Crab
Nebula high energy emission, are accelerated via reconnection events, and not at shock via Fermi mechanisms, a major
change of paradigm. Though the shock acceleration paradigm has been recently conﬁrmed by the observations (Rudy
et al. 2015b) and theoretical interpretation of the inner knot (Lyutikov et al. 2016; Yuan & Blandford 2015), the relative
contribution of reconnection and shock acceleration to the overall nebular emissivity at various frequency bands remains
unclear. To produce ﬂares a very small amount of particles needs to be accelerated to the radiation reaction limit. It is
possible that more ubiquitous smaller reconnection events accelerated the majority of particles producing X-ray Crab
nebula emission.

A. Stability of unstressed X-point

The above analytical solution shows that the steady-state X-point solution is kind of unstable. This rises the
question of how such conﬁguration can be created in a ﬁrst place. Indeed, unstable states of a dynamical system cannot
be reached via its natural evolution. However, the X-point conﬁguration considered in this analyses occupies the whole
space and so is the perturbation that leads to its collapse. In reality, X-points and their perturbations occupy only ﬁnite
volume and in order to address the stability issue comprehensively one has to study ﬁnite size conﬁgurations.

In this section we describe the response of X-point to small-scale perturbations studied via force-free simulations.
In one of our experiments, we perturbed the steady-state X-point conﬁguration by varying only the x-component of the
magnetic ﬁeld:

δBx = B⊥ sin(πy/L) exp(−(y/L)2) .

Obviously, the length scale this perturbation is L and to ensure that it is small we select a computational domain whose
size is much larger than L. In this particular case we put B⊥ = L = 1 and use the computational domain (−6, 6)×(−6, 6)
with 300 cells in each direction. Fig. 80 shows the initial conﬁguration and the solution at t = 7. One can see that
the perturbation does not push the X-point away from its steady-state. On the contrary, the waves created by the
perturbation leave the central area on the light crossing time and the steady-state conﬁguration is restored. Although,
here we present the results only for this particular type of perturbation, we have tried several other types and obtained
the same outcome. Thus, we conclude that the magnetic X-point is stable to perturbations on a length scale which is
much smaller compared to its size, even when the perturbation amplitude is substantial.

We have also veriﬁed the stability of unstressed X-points with PIC simulations. Here, no initial perturbation is

C. The inverse cascade

The Woltjer-Taylor relaxation principle (Woltier 1958; Taylor 1974) states that magnetic plasma conﬁguration try
to reach so-called constant-α conﬁguration, conserving helicity in the process of relaxation. Such relaxation process is
necessarily dissipative, though the hope typically is that it is weakly dissipative. In case of 2D magnetic ABC structures
the energy per helicity ∝ α; thus, according to the Woltjer-Taylor relaxation principle the system will try to reach a
state with smallest α consistent with the boundary condition. This, formally, constitutes an inverse-type cascade of
magnetic energy to largest scales. On the other hand, such cascade is highly dissipative: conservation of helicity requires
that B ∝ α3/2, thus magnetic energy per ﬂux tube B2/α2 ∝ α decreases with the size of the tube (α is proportional to
the inverse radius). This implies that a large fraction of the magnetic energy is dissipated at each scale of the inverse
cascade - cascade is highly non-inertial. In contrast, the Woltjer-Taylor relaxation principle assumes a weakly resistive
process. Highly eﬃcient dissipation of magnetic energy is conﬁrmed by our numerical results that indicate that during
merger approximately half of the magnetic energy is dissipated, §6. As a results such cascade cannot lead to an eﬃcient
energy accumulation on the largest scales.

To ﬁnd the scaling of the cascade, consider a helicity-conserving merger of two islands parametrized by B1 and

conservation of area α2 = α1/√2; then B2 = B1/√2. The magnetic energy of the new state E2 = √2B2
Thus a fraction 1 − 1/√2 = 0.29 of the magnetic energy is dissipated in each step.
∝ (1− 1/√2)n. The two power-laws are connected by the index p = − ln 2/(2 ln(1− 1/√2)) = 3.54. This is very close to

the result of Zrake (2014) who concluded that the power-law index is close to 7/2 (the initial conditions used by Zrake
2014, are diﬀerent from ours).

Next, in each step the size of the island growth by √2. After n steps the scale is ∝ √2

The eﬃcient dissipation of the magnetic energy is conﬁrmed by our numerical results that indicate that during
merger a large fraction of the magnetic energy is dissipated. As a results such cascade cannot lead to an eﬃcient energy
accumulation on largest scales.

In addition, we have veriﬁed that the ﬁnal states are close to force-free. Due to square box size and periodic

boundary conditions, the following family of force-free solutions is then appropriate:

(cid:112)

Az = cos ax sin
B = ∇ × Az + αAzez
In particular, Az = cos(x/√5) sin(2y√5) produces two islands, Fig. 81.

(C1)

Thus, we conclude that the inverse cascade of 2D magnetic ABC structures proceeds through (nearly) force-free self-
similar conﬁgurations of ever increasing size. But the cascade is non-inertial (highly dissipative) with the approximate
index of 3.54.
