ABSTRACT

We use high-resolution ground-based observations from the VLT CRIRES instrument in December 2012 to identify sixteen previously
+ emission lines from Jupiter’s ionosphere. These emission lines are located in Jupiter’s 5-micron window (4.5-5.2 μm),
undetected H3
+ emission
an optically-thin region of the planet’s spectrum where the radiation mostly originates from the deep troposphere. The H3
+ emission
lines are so strong that they are visible even against this bright background. We measure the Doppler broadening of the H3
lines in order to evaluate the kinetic temperature of the molecules, and we obtain a value of 1390±160 K. We also measure the relative
intensities of lines in the ν2 fundamental in order to calculate the rotational temperature, obtaining a value of 960±40 K. Finally, we
use the detection of an emission line from the 2ν2(2)-ν2 overtone to measure a vibrational temperature of 925±25 K. We use these
three independent temperature estimates to discuss the thermodynamic equilibrium of Jupiter’s ionosphere.

1. Introduction

+ lines are a valuable tool

Observations of H3
in studying
Jupiter’s upper atmosphere. It can be used to measure iono-
spheric temperatures, and to trace energy inputs from high-
energy particles and solar radiation. The species itself also di-
rectly aﬀects the ionospheric conditions, both acting as a stabil-
ising ‘thermostat’, and providing the main contribution to iono-
spheric conductivity. Further details on the role of H3
+ in plane-
tary atmospheres can be found in Miller et al. (2006).

The ﬁrst spectroscopic detection of H3

+ emission from
Jupiter’s ionosphere was made by Drossart et al. (1989) in the
2ν2(l = 2) overtone band at 2 μm in the K-band. This was almost
immediately followed by detections of the ν2 fundamental at 4
μm in the L-band (e.g. Oka & Geballe 1990), and more recently
by detection of the 2ν2(0)-ν2 (4 μm) and 3ν2(3)-ν2 (2 μm) over-
tones (Stallard et al. 2002; Raynaud et al. 2004). The strongest
H3
+ signature is localised around the northern and southern au-
roral ovals (Drossart et al. 1992); in these regions of the planet,
high-energy electrons are accelerated along the magnetic ﬁeld
lines into the upper atmosphere, where they ionise Jupiter’s neu-
tral gases to produce H2
+ and H2 can then combine to pro-
+ and H, a reaction that is so eﬃcient that very little
duce H3
H2
+ remains in the upper atmosphere. In addition to this auroral
eﬀect, there is a planet-wide signal due to extreme ultra-violet
radiation from the sun which also causes ionisation (Miller et al.
1997).

+. H2

Studying the H3

+ emission lines can provide us with sev-
eral diﬀerent types of temperature measurements for Jupiter’s
ionosphere. The kinetic temperature, Tkin, can be derived from
the Doppler broadening of individual lines. The rotational tem-
perature, Trot, can be derived by comparing the relative inten-
sities of diﬀerent rotational lines within the same vibrational
manifold. The vibrational temperature, Tvib, can be derived by
simultaneously measuring lines from multiple vibrational lev-
els. If the gas is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE),
then these three temperatures should be the same. The kinetic
temperature of H3
+ in Jupiter’s ionosphere has been measure
once before (Drossart et al. 1993), the vibrational temperature

has been measured twice (Stallard et al. 2002; Raynaud et al.
2004), and several studies have measured the rotational temper-
ature (Drossart et al. 1989; Oka & Geballe 1990; Maillard et al.
1990).

In this work, we use high-resolution ground-based observa-
+ emission lines in the
tions to identify previously undetected H3
4.5-5.2 μm range, belonging to the ν2 fundamental and to the
2ν2(2)-ν2 overtone. These emission lines are located in Jupiter’s
5-micron atmospheric window; at these wavelengths, Jupiter’s
atmosphere is optically thin, allowing us to view bright radi-
ation from deep in the planet’s troposphere. We then measure
the broadening of these lines to evaluate Tkin and we measure
the relative intensities of the ν2 lines to evaluate Trot. Finally,
we compare the fundamental and overtone lines to evaluate Tvib.
This is ﬁrst time that all three temperatures have been measured
simultaneously.

2. Observations and data reduction

Observations of Jupiter were made using the CRIRES instrument
at the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope
(VLT). These observations took place on 12 November 2012 at
05:00-05:40 UT. CRIRES is a cryogenic high-resolution infrared
echelle spectrograph which provides long-slit spectroscopy with
a resolving power of 96,000 (Käuﬂ et al. 2004). The observa-
tions were made in 14 diﬀerent wavelength settings that to-
gether cover the entirety of Jupiter’s 5-micron atmospheric win-
dow. Each wavelength setting was observed at a slightly diﬀer-
ent time, so corresponds to a slightly diﬀerent longitude, rang-
ing from 87◦W to 108◦W. The 0.2×40” slit was aligned north-
south along Jupiter’s central meridian; on this date, Jupiter’s
angular diameter was 48” so the observations cover the north
pole, but not the south pole. Observations were also made of a
standard star, HIP 22509 (A1 Vn type, RA: 04:50:36.72, Dec:
08:54:00.56).

The initial data reduction was performed using the EsoRex
pipeline (Ballester et al. 2006). This included bias-subtraction,
ﬂat-ﬁelding, wavelength calibration using known telluric lines,

and noise calculation using sky observations. Corrections were
subsequently performed to account for tilting in both the spec-
tral and spatial directions. In the spectral direction, this was
achieved using telluric lines, and in the spatial direction, this
was achieved by cross-correlating the latitudinal proﬁle at dif-
ferent wavelengths. The jovian spectra were divided through by
the standard star observations in order to account for telluric ab-
sorption and to provide radiometric calibration. The estimated
ﬂux loss due to the narrow slit (0.2” compared to a seeing of
0.4”) was accounted for in this calibration. We ﬁnd that the
5-micron brightness temperatures vary between 200 K in the
coolest parts of the planet and 260 K in the brightest regions.
This is roughly consistent with the Cassini VIMS 5-μm observa-
tions, which showed a 190-240 K range (Giles et al. 2015); any
diﬀerences are likely to be due to how centrally the standard star
was located within the narrow slit. It should be noted that the ab-
solute calibration does not impact the quantitative results in this
paper, as we only measure the widths and relative intensities of
the emission lines.

Geometric data were calculated using the angular size of the
planet, the angular size of each pixel and the location of the
planet’s limb. We assumed that the slit was aligned with Jupiter’s
central meridian.

+ emission lines in this spectral region.
We detected sixteen H3
These lines were identiﬁed using the spectroscopic line list of
Kao et al. (1991), and are listed in Table 1. Fifteen of the lines
belong to the ν2 fundamental band, and the remaining line (lo-
cated at 4.6118 μm) belongs to the 2ν2(2)-ν2 overtone. This is
the ﬁrst time that an emission line from this overtone has been
observed in Jupiter’s atmosphere. All of the lines are in the P-
branch of the vibrational manifold, and the line identiﬁcation
describes the (J,K,l) quantum numbers of the lower state.

The ﬁrst emission line to be identiﬁed was the P(5,5) line
at 4.48401 μm. Using this emission line, we explored how the

strength of the H3
+ emission varied with latitude. In order to im-
prove the signal-to-noise, the data was smoothed with a spatial
bin width of three pixels. At each pixel, we used the IDL MP-
FIT routine (Markwardt 2009) to ﬁt the P(5,5) emission line. As
CRIRES is an echelle spectrometer, the instrumental line shape
is triangular, and the resolving power of 96,000 translates into a
resolution of ∼5×10−5
μm. Because the slit is very narrow, the
broadening that occurs from Jupiter’s rotation and the horizon-
tal ﬂow of gas is expected to be negligible. The function used
to ﬁt the data was therefore a convolution of a known triangular
lineshape (from the instrument) and an unknown Gaussian curve
(from the Doppler broadening). There were six variables used:
three for the Gaussian component (line centre, line width, line
strength) and three for the background (a quadratic ﬁt).

Figure 1(a) shows how the integrated radiance of the emis-
sion line varies with latitude. For comparison, Figure 1(b) shows
+ emission is a
the continuum radiance. The strength of the H3
factor of ∼100 higher in the polar regions than in the equatorial
regions, which is consistent with the fact that H3
+ is predom-
inantly an auroral species. Since the northern polar region has
the strongest H3
+ signature, data from this region (84-86◦N) was
used to search for additional emission lines. The results of that
search are the sixteen lines described in Table 1, and they are
each shown in Figure 2.

3.2. Kinetictemperature

The kinetic temperature of the H3
+ ions can be determined by
measuring the width of the emission lines. We restricted our
analysis to the same northern polar region (84-86◦N) shown in
Figure 2, where the emission lines are strongest; at other lati-
tudes, the low signal-to-noise prevents reliable results. As in the
previous section, we used the MPFIT routine to ﬁt a convolu-
tion of a triangle and a Gaussian to the sixteen observed lines.
These ﬁts are shown by the red lines in Figure 2 and the Gaus-
sian FWHM of each line is given in Table 1. These Doppler line
widths can then then converted into a kinetic temperature, Tkin,
via Equation 1 (e.g Emerson 1996):

where M is the molar mass of the molecule, c is the speed of
light, R is the molar gas constant, ∆λ is the Doppler line width
and λ0 is the wavelength at the centre of the line.

If a 10% error is assumed for the resolving power of the
CRIRES instrument, then the average kinetic temperature is
1390±160 K. This is reasonably consistent with the value of
1150±60 K that was obtained by Drossart et al. (1993) using an
emission line at 3.5 μm.

+ abundance should be consistent,
86◦W. Within each set, the H3
but the abundance may vary between the sets. The normalised
intensities of these lines are shown by the grey bars in Figure 3.
In the optically thin limit, the integrated radiance of the
emission line (relative to the continuum) is proportional to the
optical depth, and therefore to the line intensity. As described
in Stallard et al. (2002), if LTE is assumed, then the line inten-
sity, I, of a particular transition is given by

The rotational temperature of the H3
by measuring the relative intensities of diﬀerent rotational lines

observations of ﬁfteen lines from the same ν2 fundamental band.
Since multiple wavelength settings were used to make these
observations, we do not have the full set of H3
+ lines at any
given spatial location; diﬀerent lines correspond to diﬀerent lon-
gitudes. However, there is some overlap between the segments,
such that several emission lines were observed twice. If we as-
+ temperature is constant across this region,

and that the only variations are in in the H3

we can scale the diﬀerent lines so they can be compared. Once
scaled, we have three sets of lines that can be directly compared:
(i) P(5,0), P(5,1), P(5,2) and P(5,3) at 94◦W (ii) P(5,4), P(5,5),
P(6,1) and P(6,2) at 101◦W, (iii) P(6,4), P(7,4) and P(7,5) at

where ω is the wavenumber of the transition, g is the nuclear
spin degeneracy factor, J′ is the rotational quantum number of
the upper state, A is the Einstein A coeﬃcient, Q(T ) is the par-
tition function (Miller et al. 2013), E′ is the energy of the upper
state and Trot is the rotational temperature.

For each emission line, the parameters ω, g, J′, A and E′ are
known (Neale et al. 1996). We can therefore search for a tem-
perature T rot that reproduces the relative intensities shown in
Figure 3. We used MPFIT to apply a least-squares ﬁt, with four
variables: Trot and three scaling factors for each of the three sets
of emission lines, which are proportional to the H3+ abundance
in each case.

This ﬁtting process produced a best-ﬁt Trot of 960±40 K.

abundances are 1.47 (94◦W), 1.00 (101◦W) and 1.26 (86◦W),
and the grey bars in Figure 3 have been scaled according to these
values. In order to conﬁrm that this ﬁtting process was reliable,
the three sets of lines were also ﬁt independently, using just two
parameters in each case (Trot and a scaling factor). This pro-
duced results of 880±110, 980±40, 830±170 K, which is con-
sistent with the overall value of 960±40 K. This result is also
consistent with previously published results for the rotational
temperature of H3
+ in Jupiter’s atmosphere, which range from
670 K (Oka & Geballe 1990) to 1250 K (Drossart et al. 1993).

3.4. Vibrationaltemperature

The vibrational temperature of the H3
+ ions can be determined
by measuring the relative intensities of emission lines from dif-
ferent vibrational manifolds. In this dataset, we have simultane-
ous observations of one emission line from an overtone band,
P(5,6+), alongside several emission lines from the fundamental
band: P(5,0), P(5,1) and P(5,3). Equation 2 can be expressed as

where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to two diﬀerent emission
lines. If we compare the intensity of the overtone line with each
of the three fundamental band lines, we obtain vibrational tem-
peratures of 940±50 K, 910±80 and 920±30 K. The mean value
of Tvib is therefore 925±25 K. Previous studies found Tvib values
of 900-1250 K (Stallard et al. 2002) and 960±50 (Raynaud et al.
2004).

4. Discussion and conclusions

In this work, we use high-resolution ground-based observations
from the CRIRES instrument at the VLT to identify previously-
undetected H3
+ emission lines in Jupiter’s 5-micron spectrum:
ﬁfteen lines from the ν2 fundamental, and one line from the
2ν2(2)-ν2 overtone. By considering the broadening and rela-
tive intensities of these lines, we measure an average Tkin of
1390±160 K, an average Trot of 960±40 K and an average Tvib
of 925±25 K. All of these values are consistent with previous
measurements of H3

+ in Jupiter’s ionosphere.

By comparing these temperatures, we can gain insight into
whether the assumption of LTE is valid. The Einstein-A coeﬃ-
cients of the rotational transitions are very small, so at the tem-
peratures and densities present in Jupiter’s ionosphere, the rota-

the kinetic temperature; we ﬁnd that Trot is slightly lower than
Tkin, which could suggest that this assumption is not valid. The
only previous study to compare Tkin and Trot found consistent
values (1150K and 1250K, Drossart et al. 1993). However the
Trot in this case was larger than the temperature derived by most
other studies. It is less surprising that Tvib is lower than Tkin,
since the theoretical work Melin et al. (2005) has shown that vi-
brational levels depart from LTE in Jupiter’s upper atmosphere,
and the observational work of Raynaud et al. (2004) also found
this to be the case.

Departures from LTE will primarily aﬀect the high altitudes
(>2000 km above 1 bar), where the atmosphere is both hot and
tenuous (Melin et al. 2005). This signiﬁcantly reduces the abil-
ity of H3
+ to act as a thermostat in Jupiter’s upper atmosphere,
as the energy inputs from charged particles and solar radiation
are not oﬀset by the cooling provided by H3
+. In addition, non-
LTE eﬀects alter the apparent H3
+ column density, which in turn
aﬀects the inferred conductivity of the ionosphere. The degree
to which LTE holds is therefore important in understanding the
energy budget of the upper atmosphere.

It should be noted that this suggested violation of rotational
LTE must await direct conﬁrmation by future measurements.
The key challenge of this study was the use of H3
+ lines in mul-
tiple diﬀerent wavelength settings, observed at diﬀerent times,
meaning that we are potentially convolving diﬀerent tempera-
tures and ionospheric wind speeds, in addition to diﬀerent H3
+
abundances. Only an instrument capable of simultaneous obser-
vations of multiple H3
+ lines over a broad wavelength range
could allow conﬁrmation that Trot and Tkin are genuinely out
of equilibrium. This study may be possible with future obser-
vations, including IRTF/ISHELL and the refurbished CRIRES.
+ have focussed on the L-band and the
K-band. This work opens up a new atmospheric window for fu-
ture studies: the M-band. This increases the range of instruments
that can be used to observe H3
+ auroral emission, and will also
allow for simultaneous studies of both the upper and deep atmo-
sphere.
