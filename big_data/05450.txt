We show through the Choi matrix approach that the eﬀect of Unruh acceleration on a qubit
is similar to the interaction of the qubit with a vacuum bath, despite the ﬁniteness of the Unruh
temperature. Thus, rather counterintuitvely, from the perspective of decoherence in this framework,
the particle experiences a vacuum bath with a temperature-modiﬁed interaction strength, rather
than a thermal bath. We investigate how this “relativistic decoherence” is modiﬁed by the presence
of environmentally induced decoherence, by studying the degradation of quantum information, as
quantiﬁed by parameters such as nonlocality, teleportation ﬁdelity, entanglement, coherence and
quantum measurement-induced disturbance (a discord-like measure). Also studied are the perfor-
mance parameters such as gate and channel ﬁdelity. We highlight the distinction between dephasing
and dissipative environmental interactions, by considering the actions of quantum non-demolition
and squeezed generalized amplitude damping channels, respectively, where, in particular, squeezing
is shown to be a useful quantum resource.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum information is emerging in the forefront of processing and harnessing of information, using the advantages
of quantum mechanics, as well as becoming an essential ingredient towards understanding the fundamental aspects of
nature. Relativistic quantum information is a natural quest in this direction [1–7]. In this context, Unruh eﬀect [8, 9]
which predicts thermal eﬀects from observing uniform acceleration of the Minkowski vacuum has attracted intense
interest [10–14].

Experimental progress in this direction is now attracting considerable attention from the community. Circuit quan-
tum electrodynamics (cQED), using Superconducting Quantum Interferometric Devices (SQUIDs), is a promising
eﬀort in this direction. Here tuneable boundary conditions are possible, corresponding to mirrors moving at speeds
close to the speed of light in the medium. This was used to experimentally simulate the scenario of dynamical Casimir
eﬀect [15], hitherto belonging to the regime of quantum ﬁeld theory. This paved the way for investigations into var-
ious facets of relativistic quantum information. Thus, for example, there have been investigations into relativistic
quantum teleportation [16], entanglement generation and gate operations using superconducting resonators [17, 18],
entanglement generation via the dynamical Casimir eﬀect using SQUID [19, 20], relativistic eﬀects with supercon-
ducting qubits [21] and universal quantum computation, using continuous variable Gaussian cluster states, through
relativistic motion of cavity mirrors [22]. Further, there have been investigations of twin paradox in superconducting
circuits [23] as well as using the geometric phase to detect the Unruh temperature at accelerations small enough to be
experimentally feasible [24]. There have also been investigations into the quantum metrology aspects of Unruh eﬀect
[25–27].

This sets the scene for the present investigation where the eﬀect of environmentally induced decoherence, an in-
evitable attribute for an experimental realization, on various facets of quantum information, as quantiﬁed by pa-
rameters such as nonlocality, teleportation ﬁdelity, entanglement, coherence and quantum measurement-induced
disturbance (a discord-like measure) are studied. We highlight the distinction between dephasing and dissipative
environmental interactions, by considering the actions of quantum non-demolition (QND) and squeezed generalized
amplitude damping (SGAD) channels, respectively. The QND channel is a purely quantum eﬀect incorporating de-

coherence without dissipation [28], tracing its roots to gravitational wave detection [29, 30]. The SGAD [31, 32] is a
very general dissipative channel of the Lindblad class and incorporates the well known amplitude damping (AD) and
generalized amplitude damping (GAD) channels as limiting cases. In [33], the pure Unruh channel for the Dirac qubit,
that is, the Unruh channel without any external inﬂuence, was characterized information theoretically by constructing
its Kraus operators. Here, the Unruh channel is quantiﬁed taking into account possible ambient external inﬂuences.
Useful parameters characterizing channel performance are the gate ﬁdelity [34] as well as the average gate ﬁdelity
[32, 35, 36]. They represent how well a (noisy) gate performs the operation it is supposed to implement. How well
a gate preserves the distinguishability of states is captured by another channel performance parameter, the channel
ﬁdelity, introduced in [31]. These channel parameters are applied here to the Unruh channel, both with and without
external inﬂuences.

The plan of the work is as follows. In Section II, we brieﬂy discuss the Unruh channel for the Dirac qubit with
emphasis towards its information theoretic characterization. This is followed by studying how external inﬂuences,
characterized by parameters like temperature, squeezing and evolution time, eﬀect various features of quantum in-
formation, such as nonlocality, entanglement, teleportation ﬁdelity and measurement-induced disturbance. Next, the
average gate and channel ﬁdelities are studied in order to gain insight into the nature of the Unruh channel. Quantum
coherence, characteristic of a quantum operation, as a resource theory has attracted a lot of attention in recent times.
Mixing, which is inevitable with evolution, will result in a degradation of coherence. In order to have an operational
etimation of the utility of a quantum task, it is imperative to have an understanding of the trade-oﬀ between the two
[38–40]. This is done for the Unruh channel, pure as well as in the presence of ambient eﬀects, in the penultimate
section. We then make our conclusions.

INVITATION TO UNRUH EFFECT

We consider two observers, Alice (A) and Rob (R) sharing a maximally entangled initial state of two qubits at a
point in ﬂat Minkowski spacetime. Then Rob moves with a uniform acceleration and Alice stays stationary. Moreover,
we assume that the observers are equipped with detectors that are sensitive only to their respective modes and share
the following maximally entangled initial state:

|ψ(cid:105)A,R =

|00(cid:105)A,R + |11(cid:105)A,R

√

.

(1)

Assuming that R gets uniformly accelerated with acceleration a, from R’s frame the Minkowski vacuum state is a

two mode squeezed state [11]:

and the excited state is

|0(cid:105)M = cos(r)|0(cid:105)I|0(cid:105)II + sin(r)|1(cid:105)I|1(cid:105)II ,

|1(cid:105)M = cos(r)|1(cid:105)I|1(cid:105)II ,

where cos(r) =

1√

− 2πωc

and ω is Dirac particle acceleration with c being the speed of light in vacuum.

From the Fig. (1), it can be seen that the regions I and II are causally disconnected. The state in Eq. (1) has
contribution from the regions I and II. Since these regions are disconnected, the mode corresponding to II can be
traced out to obtain the following density matrix

(cid:2)cos2(r)|00(cid:105)(cid:104)00| + cos(r)(|00(cid:105)(cid:104)11| + |11(cid:105)(cid:104)00|) + sin2(r)|01(cid:105)(cid:104)01| + |11(cid:105)(cid:104)11|(cid:3) .

representation of the Unruh channel can be obtained. Following the procedure for constructing Kraus operators we

[31, 32]. Here γ = 1
. Thus, rather surprisingly, from the viewpoint of decoherence, the qubit experiences a
vacuum bath, with the role of Unruh temperature being to modify the interaction strength, rather than to serve as
bath temperature.

T∞ is the maximum temperature that can be simulated by Unruh eﬀect. Since the maximum temperature is never
inﬁnite, the asymptotic state due to Unruh acceleration is never a maximally mixed state and entanglement is seen
to survive [33]. In contrast, the qubit interacting with a thermal bath can become maximally mixed for inﬁnite bath
temperatures.

Once we have the Kraus operators of the Unruh channel, we can calculate its eﬀect on a qubit in pure state given

by

III. DEGRADATION OF QUANTUM INFORMATION UNDER UNRUH CHANNEL

The nonclassicality of quantum information can be characterized in terms of nonlocality B (for e.g., Bell inequality
violation [45–50]), entanglement, characterized here by concurrence C [51], teleportation ﬁdelity Fmax [49, 52, 53]
or weaker nonclassicality measures like quantum discord D [54] or measurement induced disturbance M [55]. In the
accelerated reference frame, the Unruh eﬀect degrades the quantumness of the state (4) [27, 33]. To achieve our goal,
we consider the scenario wherein only Robs qubit is interacting with a noisy environment. The other case in which
both the qubits of the two observers interact with a noisy environment is not seen here to produce any qualitatively
useful insight and hence is not considered in what follows.

A. Eﬀect of QND noise

Assuming an Ohmic bath spectral density with an upper cut-oﬀ frequency ωc, it can be shown that

QND is a purely dephasing noise channel whose action on a qubit, characterized by frequency ω0, can be studied

For the initial time t = 0, when the QND interaction has not begun, e−ω0γ2(t) = 1 and the above Kraus operators
reduce to that in Eq. (6). The composition of the dephasing channel with the Unruh channel has 3 Kraus operators,
essentially because only three of the resulting four operators obtained under composition, are linearly independent.

The QND channel acting on the Unruh qubit eﬀects its quantum characteristics and can be studied by the behavior
of the diﬀerent facets of quantum correlations. For the case of QND noise acting on Rob, analytical expressions can
be obtained for the corresponding measures of quantum correlations which are as follows,

The analytical expression for entanglement C turns out to be very involved. Hence we only provide a numerical
analysis. For the initial time t = 0 when QND interaction has not begun, e−ω0γ2(t) = 1 and the expressions Fmax, B
and M in the above equations reduce to the pure Unruh-eﬀect case.

The ﬁgures 2 to 5 correspond to the behavior of various aspects of quantum correlations of the Unruh channel under
the inﬂuence of QND noise. It can be seen from Fig. 2(a) that as reservoir squeezing s increases, the channel becomes

in the Unruh acceleration depicted, here, by r. Entanglement is seen, in Fig. 3(a), to decrease with increase in s. This
feature is more prominent for T > 1. From Fig. 3(b), for a given value of r, entanglement is seen to decrease with
time. For |s| < 2, Fig. 4(a) shows that Fmax > 2

The analytical expressions are complicated and hence we resort to numerical discussions. The ﬁgures 6 - 9 correspond
to the behavior of various aspects of quantum correlations of the Unruh channel under the inﬂuence of SGAD noise.
From Fig. 6(a) it can be seen that for certain range of T , squeezing enhances B. However, for the values of the
parameters indicated, it never crosses the threshold of nonlocality (B > 1). From Fig. 6(b) it can be seen that with
increase in r and t, B decreases and the channel becomes local. From Fig. 7(a), concurrence is seen to drop drastically
to zero with increase in T . Also for large values of s, concurrence is seen to fall to zero, irrespective of T . Fig.7(b)
depicts the decrease of concurrence with respect to time for any give value of r. From Fig. 8, Fmax is seen to decrease
with T , s, r and t. From Fig. 9, M is seen to decrease with increase in the parameters r and t. However for certain
range of T , M is seen to increase with bath squeezing s, reiterating the usefulness of squeezing.

IV. AVERAGE GATE AND CHANNEL FIDELITY

In this work we are trying to understand the Unruh channel under the inﬂuence of external noisy eﬀects. From
the perspective of quantum information, a useful way to understand this is to analyze the average gate and channel
ﬁdelities [32] of the Unruh channel under the ambient environmental conditions.

The average gate ﬁdelity [31, 57–59] has a closed expression

using which Gav can be calculated. In the limit t −→ 0 this reduces to the Unruh case. Unlike the QND case, the
analytical expression for Gav for the SGAD channel is very involved, and hence we discuss this case numerically.

From Fig. 10(a), it can be seen that Gav is stable for a certain range of squeezing, after which it falls. Gav is also
seen to decrease with r. However with time, Gav ﬁrst decreases and then is then seen to increase. Since the expression
for Gav has the oscillatory term cos ω0t, oscillation is seen in Fig. 10(b) with time t.

and r. The bath parameters are ω0 = 1, the coupling γ = 0.1 and squeezing angle φ = 0, T = 0.5 and s = 0.5.

From Figs. 11, a general trend is observed of average gate ﬁdelity Gav, under the inﬂuence of the SGAD channel,
decreasing with increase in T as well as evolution time t, for a given r. However, as can be observed from Fig. 11(a),
for a certain range of T , Gav is seen to increase with reservoir squeezing s. This indicates that squeezing can be a
useful quantum resource in this scenario.

Another quantity frequently used to access the channel’s performance is the channel ﬁdelity [31, 32]

(28)
where κ(B,E) is the Holevo bound for states prepared in basis B and passed through the channel E. The maximum
is achieved for the states prepared in the basis {|0(cid:105),|1(cid:105)}, i.e., for the state 1
2 (|0(cid:105)(cid:104)0| + |1(cid:105)(cid:104)1|). κ signiﬁes how well the
quantum input states are distinguishable after the action of the channel E. It can also be interpreted as how much
classical information can be extracted from the given quantum ensemble.

χ = maxB κ(B,E),

From Fig. 12 it can be seen that χ, for the Unruh-QND channel, does not change with s, T and t. The reason is
that the maximum is obtained for completely mixed state with no oﬀ-diagonal terms which make the QND ineﬀective,
whereas the diagonal terms are altered by the Unruh eﬀect. For the Unruh-SGAD channel, we see from Fig. 13(a) that
the Unruh channel drives the state away from the maximally mixed state for which the Holevo bound is maximum.
By increasing the bath squeezing and the temperature the system is driven back towards the maximally mixed states
which results in increment of χ to its maximum value. Fig. 13(b) show that as the SGAD channel acts for longer
duration the state is driven towards maximally mixed state and thus χ increases with t.

V. COHERENCE AND MIXEDNESS

Quantum coherence as a resource has attracted much attention in recent times [38–40]. Coherence plays a cen-
tral role in quantum mechanics [5] enabling operations or tasks which are impossible within the regime of classical
mechanics.

For a quantum state represented by density matrix ρ in basis {|i(cid:105)}, the l1 norm of coherence is given by

(cid:88)

i(cid:54)=j

C(ρ) =

|ρi,j|.

(29)

The mixedness, which is basically normalized linear entropy, of a d dimensional quantum state ρ is given by [56]

d
d − 1
The inequality relation between the C(ρ) and M(ρ) is [40]

M(ρ) =

(1 − Trρ2).

C(ρ)2
(d − 1)2 + M(ρ) ≤ 1.

(30)

(31)

When this inequality is saturated for certain values of C(ρ) and M(ρ), the situation corresponds to states which have
maximum coherence for a given mixedness in the states. Such states are known as Maximally Coherent Mixed States
(MCMS).

The analytical expressions for coherence and mixedness of the Unruh channel under the inﬂuence of the QND noise

are

respectively.
From Fig. 14, coherence C is seen to decrease with increase in temperature T as well as reservoir squeezing s. Mixing
M increases with both T and s. From Fig. 15, it can be seen that coherence decreases with t whereas mixedness
increases with t as well as r, a feature which is consistent with common intuition.

the input state is parameterized by θ = π/4, φ = π/4.

Also, ﬁnite s brings a notion of stability in the behavior of coherence C as a function of external temperature T .
Thus, squeezing s once again emerges as a useful resource. The expected increase in mixing M with increase in T
is observed in Fig. 16(b). From Fig. 17, it can be seen that coherence decreases with increase in t and r whereas
mixedness increases rapidly with t.

From Figs. 18 and 19, it is clear that the inequality Eq.

(31) is respected for both QND and SGAD noises,
respectively. In particular, from Fig. 18(a), due to the action of QND noise, it can be seen that for t = 2 and r = π/8,
by varying parameters T and s we cannot get any MCMS as the inequality is not saturated. However, ﬁxing T and
s to 0.5 and varying r, MCMS can be achieved, as can be seen from Fig. 18(b). For the case of SGAD noise, Fig.
19(a) depicts that for t = 2 and r = π/8, by varying the parameters T and s MCMS states can be attained. Also, by
ﬁxing T and s to 0.5 and varying r and t, MCMS can be achieved as can be seen from Fig. 19(b).

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We show that the eﬀect of Unruh acceleration on a qubit is similar to the action of an amplitude damping channel,
where the damping parameter is determined by the acceleration, and thus by the Unruh temperature. Since the
amplitude damping channel arises from interaction with a vacuum, this suggests that the Unruh temperature should
be regarded as a factor that modiﬁes the system’s interaction strength rather than as the temperature of the damping
environment. We study how environmentally induced decoherence modiﬁes the eﬀect of the Unruh channel, essentially
by investigating the degradation of quantum information, as quantiﬁed by measures such as nonlocality, mixed-state

entanglement, teleportation ﬁdelity, coherence and a discord-like quantity. The diﬀering eﬀects of an environment that
interacts dissipatively or non-dissipatively are noted. In particular, the latter is shown to lead to a non-Pauli channel
of rank 3. Further, useful parameters characterizing channel performance such as gate and channel ﬁdelity are applied
here to the Unruh channel, both with and without external inﬂuences. Squeezing is shown to be a useful resource
in a number of scenarios. We hope this work is a contribution towards the development of relativistic quantum
technologies.
