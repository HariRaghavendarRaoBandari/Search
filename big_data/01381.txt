ABSTRACT

Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are bursts of γ-rays generated from relativistic jets launched from
catastrophic events such as massive star core collapse or binary compact star coalescence. Previous
studies suggested that GRB emission is erratic, with no noticeable memory in the central engine. Here
we report a discovery that similar light curve patterns exist within individual bursts for at least some
GRBs. Applying the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method, we show that similarity of light curve
patterns between pulses of a single burst or between the light curves of a GRB and its X-ray ﬂare
can be identiﬁed. This suggests that the central engine of at least some GRBs carries “memory” of
its activities. We also show that the same technique can identify memory-like emission episodes in
the ﬂaring emission in Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters (SGRs), which are believed to be Galactic, highly
magnetized neutron stars named magnetars. Such a phenomenon challenges the standard black hole
central engine models for GRBs, and suggest a common physical mechanism behind GRBs and SGRs,
which points towards a magnetar central engine of GRBs.

1.

INTRODUCTION

In astronomy, light curves usually carry the informa-
tion about the central objects. In stably rotating neu-
tron star systems (e.g.
radio pulsars and X-ray pul-
sars), strict periodicity is detected, which is related to
the rotation period of the neutron star.
In black hole
binaries or some active galactic nuclei (AGNs), quasi-
periodic oscillation (QPO) signals are detected in certain
frequency ranges, which probe the quasi-periodic prop-
erties in the accreting systems. For transient objects
such as GRBs (e.g., M´esz´aros 2006; Gehrels et al. 2009;
Kumar & Zhang 2015) and SGRs (e.g, Kouveliotou et
al. 1998; Mereghetti et al. 2015), on the other hand, the
light curves usually track the history of the central engine
activities. Time sequence analyses of GRB light curves
using power density spectral analysis and fast Fourier
transform (Beloborodov et al. 2000; Guidorzi et al. 2012;
Hakkila & Preece 2014; Baldeschi & Guidorzi 2015) sug-
gested that these light curves are “featureless”. Using
a stepwise ﬁlter correlation method, Gao et al. (2012)
revealed the existence of superpositions of slow and fast
components in GRB light curves, but no repetitive fea-
ture of GRB emission was identiﬁed. It is believed that
due to the erratic activities of the central engine (e.g. un-
steady accretion onto a black hole), one would not expect
a repeatable pattern in GRB light curves (M´esz´aros 2006;
Kumar & Zhang 2015). In other words, the GRB cen-
tral engine is supposed to be “memory-less”. Similarly,
the SGR ﬂares mark the erratic magnetic reconnection
processes in the crusts or magnetospheres of the magne-
tars (Thompson & Duncan 1995). No regular repeatable
patterns are expected.

On May 8, 2014, GRB 140508A was detected by
Fermi/GBM (Yu & Goldstein 2014), which exhibits 6
visually dramatically similar episodes in its light curve
(Figure 1). Multi-pulse GRBs have been commonly ob-

served (Gruber et al. 2011), but the one with such a
peculiar signature has not been noticed before. Since
power density spectral analyses usually do not catch
these features, we therefore apply other analysis meth-
ods as an eﬀort to conﬁrm the visual impression of re-
peatable behavior in this burst.
Since GRB light
curves are deﬁned by many factors, including the cen-
tral engine activity, dynamical evolution (acceleration,
coasting, or deceleration) during the emission phase,
and the viewing angle, the light curves in diﬀerent
epochs may have been distorted in the time domain
even if diﬀerent episodes have intrinsic similarities. Tra-
ditional methods, such as the Bayesian Adaptive Re-
gression Splines (BARS) method introduced by KASS
(http://www.stat.cmu.edu/∼kass/bars/), are not ideal
to correct for these distortions. After testing some meth-
ods, we ﬁnd that the dynamic time warping (DTW Sakoe
& Chiba 1978) technique is well suited to address this
problem. DTW is a robust technique to search for simi-
lar time series signals by automatically coping with time
deformation and varying speed associated with time-
dependent data, and has been widely used in diverse
ﬁelds (Keogh & Ratanamahatana 2005). This method
calculates an optimal match between two time sequences
by minimizing the distance-like quantity. By eﬀectively
stretching or squeezing the time sequences, this method
can account for non-linear variation in the time dimen-
sion by non-linearly “warping” the time sequence to
achieve a similarity match with another time sequence.
In this letter, we apply the DTW method to the light
curves of GRBs and SGRs and try to identify the similar
patterns of the central engine activities of these objects.
Our method is detailed in Section 2, results are presented
in Section 3. A brief summary and discussion on astro-
physical implications are presented in Section 4.

2. METHOD

* Contact Email: zhang.grb@gmail.com

The basic concept of the DTW method and a toy exam-

2

ple to show how it works are presented in the Appendix.
Practically, the following procedure can be used to search
for a similarity pattern in a light curve. (I) Pattern se-
lection: One may select a query pattern in the light curve
(denoted as X = (x1, ..., xN )) to be searched. (II) Refer-
ence selection: By cutting the pattern oﬀ the light curve,
the rest of the light curve is regarded as the reference (de-
noted as Y = (y1, ..., yM )), which is the time series where
patterns similar to the pattern X may be searched. (III)
Search for pattern in the reference: The open-begin–end
DTW (OBE-DTW) technique (Tormene et al. 2008) is
performed in this step. The goal of a match is to mini-
mize the average accumulated distortion, D, between the
warped time series X and Yp−q, i.e.

Y (p,q) = (yp, ..., yq)
DOBE = min

1≤p≤q≤M

D(X, Y (p,q))

(1)

where D(X, Y (p,q)) = Σd(φx(k), φy(k))mφ(k)/Mφ, and
k = 1, ..., T , with T being the allowable absolute time
deviation between the two matched elements. The dis-
tance function is deﬁned as d(i, j) = |xi − yi|. Mφ is
the normalization constant so that the accumulated dis-
tortions are comparable along diﬀerent paths (Giorgino
2009), and mφ(k) is a weighting coeﬃcient. The warping
curve φ(k) is deﬁned as:

φ(k) = (φx(k), φy(k))

(2)
with φx(k) ∈ {1, ..., N} and φx(k) ∈ {p, ..., q}. The
DTW algorithm requires certain constraints on φ, e.g.,
monotonicity is imposed to preserve their time order-
ing and to avoid meaningless loops: φx(k + 1) ≥ φx(k),
φy(k + 1) ≥ φy(k), and p and q are determined dur-
ing minimizing the cumulative distance in Equation (1).
After the search, one may identify a “successful match”
(criteria deﬁned below) or a “rejected match”. (IV) After
ﬁnding the match, the matched segment is cut oﬀ from
the reference, and the step (III) is repeated to search for
more matches.

For each match, we measure the correlation between
the normalized pattern light curve and the normalized
de-warped reference light curve. We deﬁne a successful
match based on the following criteria: (a) The Pearson’s
correlation coeﬃcient is r > 0.8, which indicates a “very
strong” correlation (Evans 1996).
(b) The Spearman
rank correlation signiﬁcance level, p is less than 0.003
(3-σ level). We note that such criteria, even though care-
fully chosen based on statistical methods, have not been
applied to the DTW applications before. Strictly speak-
ing, the threshold criteria should be tested through ex-
periments. For instance, in the ﬁeld of image processing,
a false acceptance rate (FAR, e.g., Jayadevan et al. 2009)
is measured by counting the frequency that DTW falsely
recognize the true image, which is used to set the criteria
for DTW applications. However, in astrophysical prob-
lems involving transients (such as the study in this work),
we do not have the pre-knowledge about the central en-
gine to deﬁne the “correct behavior”, and also do not
have the luxury to let the source to repeat many times.
As a result, an FAR cannot be deﬁned and measured.
The criteria stated above (e.g. r > 0.8 & p < 0.003) may
not be as robust as the FAR criteria used in other ﬁelds,
but in any case, give a quantitative judgement about the

similarities among diﬀerent emission episodes.

3. RESULTS

3.1. GRB 140508A

We ﬁrst apply the method to GRB 140508A whose
light curve displays 6 separated but similar emission
episodes (Figure 1). Strong hard-to-soft spectral evolu-
tion is observed among those episodes. We select the ﬁrst
isolated episode emission above 3-σ background level as
the pattern, which is between T0-2 s to T0+18 s (where
T0 is the Fermi trigger time). Based on our criteria
described above, we identiﬁed two successful matches,
which are shown in Figures 1. For comparison, we also
plot one rejected match (3rd row in Figure 1) which does
not satisfy the successful criteria. The successful matches
suggest that at least for this GRB, the central engine has
a memory, which allowed it to reproduce a similar pat-
tern of central engine activities for at least three times.

3.2. GRB 151006A and its X-ray ﬂare

To further investigate whether similar behavior ap-
pears in other GRBs as well, we look into the light curve
data of other GRBs. Most GRBs have overlapping pulses
(unlike GRB 140508A), which make it diﬃcult to deﬁne
a clean pattern to search for possible matches. We there-
fore include X-ray ﬂares, which are the extension of the
GRB central engine activities to the weaker and softer
regime (Burrows et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2006; Chincar-
ini et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2014), in the analysis. As
an example, we show GRB 151006A, which has a sin-
gle “FRED” (fast-rise-exponential-decay, Kocevski et al.
2003) shape light curve with a duration about 20 s, and
a signiﬁcant X-ray ﬂare between ∼ 50 s and ∼ 100 s
(Figure 2). We take the 0-50 s prompt gamma-ray light
curve as the pattern, and apply our DTW technique to
search for the pattern in the X-ray ﬂare light curve. In-
terestingly, we ﬁnd a successful match (Figure 2) despite
of the obviously diﬀerent time scales and spectral ranges
between the pattern and the reference light curves.

3.3. Fermi/GBM Bursts 080823478 and 080823847

from SGR J0501+45165

In order to investigate whether the central engine
memory may also apply to other transient events, we
apply our DTW method to the light curves of SGR
bursts, which usually happen sporadically, with separa-
tions ranging from hours to months. We applied our
method to a pair of bursts, named as 080823478 and
080823847, from SGR J0501+45165 (Lin et al. 2013).
These two bursts happened in the same day but were
separated by about 9 hours. Their light curves are shown
in Figure 3. Interestingly, we ﬁnd one successful match
(Figure 3) between the ﬁrst ﬂare and the ﬁrst emis-
sion episode of the second ﬂare. Despite the previous
failure to identify a QPO from the light curves of this
source (Huppenkothen et al. 2013), we show that the
magnetar central engine of SGR J0501+45165 seems to
also carry a memory of its activities.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

By applying the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
method for the ﬁrst time to astronomical objects, we
found that similar light curve patterns do exist within

individual bursts for at least some GRBs. We also found
that such a similarity exists between the light curves of
a GRB and its X-ray ﬂare as well as distinct emission
episodes in the ﬂaring emission in SGRs, in particular,
in SGR J0501+45165.

Following physical processes may leave imprints in the
light curve of a GRB: 1. the erratic central engine ac-
tivity; 2. processes during jet propagation (e.g.
jet
modulated by a stellar envelope, e.g. Morsony et al.
2010); 3.
rapid variability in the emission region due
to magnetic reconnection or turbulence (Narayan & Ku-
mar 2009; Zhang & Yan 2011; Zhang & Zhang 2014);
and 4. geometric eﬀects (e.g. due to jet precession, Lei
et al. 2007). The mechanisms 2 & 3 invoke instabili-
ties, whose behaviors are erratic, likely not memory-like
physical. The variability of a precessing jet should be pe-
riodical, which is not true for the cases we have studied.
This makes central engine itself as a possible source of
memory. There are two widely discussed types of central
engines for GRBs: a hyper-accreting black hole (BH) and
a rapidly spinning, millisecond pulsar (or magnetar) (Ku-
mar & Zhang 2015, for a recent review). For a BH engine
model, the variability may originate from a variation in
the accretion rate, which is in turn related to the mass-
feeding rate. It is hard to imagine how a memory-like
process could regulate the accretion rate in certain pat-
terns. On the other hand, a magnetar central engine may
have the potential to induce memory-like behaviors. For
example, Klu´zniak & Ruderman (1998) invoked the dis-
ruption of magnetic loops formed in a diﬀerentially rotat-
ing neutron star central engine to interpret variability of
GRB prompt emission. A similar mechanism applied to
a massive neutron star after double neutron star mergers
could interpret X-ray ﬂares following short GRBs (Dai et
al. 2006). For these processes, similar to the solar cycle
activities, the mechanism to produce an emission episode
invokes similar physical processes, including winding up
magnetic ﬁeld lines due to diﬀerential rotation, break
ﬁeld lines at a critical condition, and release high en-
ergy particles and emission abruptly. As the emission
episode is over, the same process would repeat itself and
generate a similar emission episode2. Unlike the Sun
whose diﬀerential rotation rate is essentially constant for
many cycles (and hence, produce a 11-year periodic be-
havior), GRBs invoke a rapidly evolving central engine
with the power quickly decrease with time. One there-
fore does not expect a strict periodicity, but expect the
late-time emission episodes be weaker and more tempo-
rally stretched with respect to the early-time ones. This
would give a possible interpretation to the discovery in
this paper. Since SGRs are Galactic magnetars, the dis-
covery of memory patterns in these objects is consistent
with this interpretation. Since GRB magnetar models
produce highly magnetized winds, the results also lend
supports to the GRB emission models that invoke dissi-
pation of Poynting ﬂux energy as the resource of GRB
prompt emission (Zhang & Yan 2011).

APPENDIX

BASICS OF THE DYNAMIC TIME WARPING METHOD AND ITS APPLCIAITON TO ASTRONOMICAL LIGHT CURVES

Dynamic time warping (DTW) was originally developed for speech recognition (Sakoe & Chiba 1978; Rabiner &
Juang 1983; Juang & Rabiner 1991), i.e. to ﬁnd an optimal alignment between two given time series under certain
restrictions. The method allows one sequence to be warped in a nonlinear manner to match the other. For example,
similarities in speech patterns (e.g., same words or phases) can be detected using DTW, even if one person was speaking
faster than the other, or if there were accelerations/decelerations during the course of an observation. This technique
is now widely used in many other ﬁelds as a tool of data mining and information retrieval, such as in computer vision
science (e.g., signature/ﬁngerprint recognition; Munich & Perona 1999; Kovacs-Vajna 1999), bioinformatics (e.g., Aach
& Church 2001), chemical engineering (e.g., Dai & Zhao 2011), to automatically handle the time deformations and
diﬀerent speeds associated with time-dependent data. We refer the interested readers to Keogh & Ratanamahatana
(2005) for a more detailed technical treatment.

A toy example is presented in Figure 4 to illustrate the method and its application to astronomical light curves.
In this example, we assumes that an astronomical object emits its light curve with a perfect sine function in Episode
A, then emits a distorted sine shape light curve (with ﬂuctuations in amplitude included), and slows down in time
non-uniformly by an averaged factor of 2 in Episode B. By applying the DTW method, one can successfully ﬁnd the
similarity between the light curves in the two episodes (see point-to-point matches through red lines).

by about 9 hours. Such 9-hour separation is marked with a dashed line.

Figure 4. A toy example illustrating how the DTW method works for light curves. An astronomical object is assumed to emit its light
curve with a perfect sine function in Episode A, and then emits a distorted sine shape light curve (with ﬂuctuations in amplitude added),
and slows down in time non-uniformly by an averaged factor of 2, in Episode B. The red lines, calculated by the DTW method, show the
alignments between the two episodes.
