A Quasi-sure Non-degeneracy Property for the

Brownian Rough Path

H. Boedihardjo∗, X. Geng†, X. Liu‡ and Z. Qian§

March 3, 2016

Abstract

In the present paper, we are going to show that outside a slim set in
the sense of Malliavin (or quasi-surely), the signature path (which consists
of iterated path integrals in every degree) of Brownian motion is non-self-
intersecting. This property relates closely to a non-degeneracy property
for the Brownian rough path arising naturally from the uniqueness of
signature problem in rough path theory. As an important consequence we
conclude that quasi-surely, the Brownian rough path does not have any
tree-like pieces and every sample path of Brownian motion is uniquely
determined by its signature up to reparametrization.

1 Introduction

In 1954, motivated from the study of homotopy theory and loop space homology,
Chen [4] proposed a way of representing a vector-valued path x by a fully non-
commutative tensor series

S(x) =

∞Xn=0

ˆ0<t1<···<tn<T

dxt1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ dxtn

(1.1)

of iterated path integrals. In recent literature, this representation is known as
the signature of a path. Intuitively, the ﬁrst degree of S(x) is the increment
of x, and the second degree of S(x) encodes the geometric signed area enclosed
by x and the chord connecting its end points.
In general, the signature is a
global quantity which captures the total “area” in each degree produced by the
underlying path.

The fundamental importance of the signature representation lies in the fact
that it is essentially faithful: the signature uniquely determines the underlying
path in a certain sense. This is a deep point as it reveals the relationship
between local and global properties of a path. The ﬁrst result along this direction
was contained in Chen’s original work [5] in 1958, in which he proved that an
irreducible and piecewise regular path is uniquely determined by its signature
up to translation and reparametrization.

However, the class of paths Chen studied is very special as it does not reveal
a crucial invariance property of the signature map: a piece along which the
path x goes out and traces back does not contribute to the signature of x. The
characterization of this invariance property in a precise mathematical form is the
key point of understanding in what sense a generic path x is uniquely determined
by its signature.
It was after ﬁve decades that Hambly and Lyons [10] ﬁrst
gave a complete characterization in the case of continuous paths with bounded
variation.
In particular, they showed that a continuous path with bounded
variation is uniquely determined by its signature up to tree-like equivalence in
their sense deﬁned in terms of a height function.

Since the work of Hambly and Lyons, many eﬀorts have been made to explore
beyond the bounded variation setting. For applications in probability theory,
a natural class of paths to be considered is the space of rough paths, as it
is well known that a large amount of interesting stochastic processes can be
regarded as rough paths in a canonical way. However, in the rough path setting,
Hambly and Lyons’ characterization does not apply any more as their tree-
like characterization forces the underlying path to have bounded variation. It
was in a recent work of Boedihardjo, Geng, Lyons and Yang [2] that the right
characterization for the above invariance property was identiﬁed in terms of a
real tree structure and the corresponding uniqueness result for signature was
established.

On the other hand, if we consider the uniqueness problem for sample paths
of a stochastic process, we might expect stronger results since a stochastic pro-
cess usually has non-degenerate sample paths and the above invariance phe-
nomenon will not appear at all. A series of probabilistic works have been done
along this direction, originally for Brownian motion by Le Jan and Qian [14],
which was later extended to hypoelliptic diﬀusions by Geng and Qian [9] and
Gaussian processes by Boedihardjo and Geng [1]. Formally the result can be
stated as the fact that with probability one, every sample path of the underlying
stochastic process is uniquely determined by its signature up to translation and
reparametrization.

The techniques involved in studying the uniqueness problem for signature
in the deterministic and probabilistic settings are very diﬀerent. Moreover, the
deterministic result is weaker but it treats all possible rough paths in one goal,
while the probabilistic result is stronger but we have to work in the support
of the law of the underlying process on path space. The link between the
deterministic and probabilistic approaches seems to be missing, and the main
goal of the present paper is to ﬁll in this gap in a relatively robust way.

To be more precise, we will be interested in the following non-degeneracy

2

property for the Brownian rough path: it is not possible for a path having a piece
along which the path goes out and traces back (the precise mathematical state-
ment will be made in the next section). As discussed before, this non-degeneracy
property arises naturally from the deterministic uniqueness of signature problem
for rough paths. In particular, we are going to prove this non-degeneracy prop-
erty in Malliavin’s capacity setting, which is much stronger than the probability
measure case and it reveals ﬁner analytic structure over the Wiener space than
the underlying probability measure. According to the deterministic uniqueness
result for signature in [2], a direct consequence is that outside a slim set in
the sense of Malliavin or quasi-surely (see deﬁnition in the next Section), every
sample path of Brownian motion is uniquely determined by its signature up to
reparametrization.

The main motivation of investigating quasi-sure analysis for the Brownian
rough path lies in the fundamental work of Sugita [20] in 1988 that capacity is
a universal object with respect to a large class of positive generalized Wiener
functionals. Therefore, the quasi-sure analysis provides a powerful universal tool
in studying degenerate functionals (for instance the Brownian bridge or pinned
diﬀusions) on the Brownian rough path.

According to [2], the aforementioned quasi-sure non-degeneracy property for
the Brownian rough path is equivalent to the quasi-sure non-self-intersection
for the Brownian signature path. Indeed, we are going to obtain a quantitative
constraint on the degree n of signature, the dimension d of Brownian motion and
the capacity index (r, q) (see (2.1) in the next Section for deﬁnition), under which
the truncated Brownian signature path up to degree n is non-self-intersecting
outside a set of zero (r, q)-capacity.

Intersection properties for random walks and stochastic processes is a clas-
sical topic in probability theory, and it has important applications in statistical
ﬁeld theory. The non-self-intersection of sample paths of Brownian motion was
studied extensively in the literature. The ﬁrst result dates back to 1944, in
which Kakutani [13] proved that almost every sample path of Brownian mo-
tion is non-self-intersecting if the dimension d > 5. Later on, it was known by
Dvoretzky, Erdős and Kakutani [6] that the optimal dimension is d = 4. The
technique of Kakutani was extended to the capacity setting on Wiener space by
Fukushima [8]. In particular, he showed that outside a set of zero (1, 2)-capacity,
every sample path of Brownian motion is non-self-intersecting if d > 7. This re-
sult was further extended by Takeda [21] for general (r, q)-capacities under the
constraint d > rq + 4. It is remarkable that in Fukushima’s setting, Lyons [15]
proved that the optimal dimension is d = 6. However, it is not known (and we
expect that it is not true) that outside a slim set every sample path of Brownian
motion is non-self-intersecting regardless of the dimension d.

Our technique of proving the quasi-sure non-self-intersection of the Brownian
signature path is inspired by the general ideas contained in the aforementioned
series of works. In particular, the key ingredient is to establish a maximal type
capacity estimate and a small ball capacity estimate for the signature path.
However, it will be clear that our technique is robust enough to be extended to
more general Gaussian processes as it does not rely on the explicit distribution

3

of Brownian motion and any martingale properties, which is indeed the case for
the aforementioned works. In contrast to the Brownian motion, as the Brownian
signature path is an inﬁnite dimensional process taking values in the algebra of
tensor series, it is not entirely surprising that a quasi-sure non-self-intersection
result can be expected.

According to Sugita’s work in [20], our result implies the corresponding
almost-sure non-degeneracy property and uniqueness of signature result for any
probability measure on W associated with a positive generalized Wiener func-
tional.

The present paper is organized in the following way. In Section 2 we formu-
late our main result, in Section 3 we develop the proofs and in Section 4 we give
a few remarks as conclusion.

2 Formulation of Main Result

In this section, we present the basic notions in quasi-sure analysis and formulate
our main result. We refer the reader to [18] and [19] for a systematic introduction
to the Malliavin calculus and quasi-sure analysis.

Let (W, B(W ), P) be the canonical Wiener space over Rd. In other words, W
[0, 1] → Rd starting at the origin equipped
is the space of continuous paths w :
with the uniform topology, B(W ) is the Borel σ-algebra and P is the canonical
Wiener measure. Let H be the space of absolutely continuous paths in W with
square integrable derivative with respect to the Lebesgue measure. It is well
known that the canonical embedding ι : H → W give rise to the structure of
an abstract Wiener space in the sense of Gross. Let ι∗ : W ∗ → H∗ ∼= H be the
corresponding dual embedding.

Consider the space P of polynomial functionals over W, which consists of
functionals of the form F = f (ϕ1, · · · , ϕn), where f is a polynomial over Rn
and ϕ1, · · · , ϕn ∈ W ∗. The Malliavin derivative of F is the H-valued functional

DF =

nXi=1

∂f
∂xi (ϕ1, · · · , ϕn)ι∗ϕi.

This deﬁnition extends to Hilbert space valued polynomial functionals in a nat-
ural way. In particular, the r-th derivative of F ∈ P can be deﬁned inductively
as an H⊗r-valued functional. For r ∈ N and q > 1, the (r, q)-Sobolev norm of
F is deﬁned to be

kDF kr,q =  rXi=0

E[kDiF kq

q

H⊗i]! 1

.

The (r, q)-Sobolev space Dr,q is the completion of P under the (r, q)-Sobolev
norm.

Throughout the rest we always assume that r ∈ N and q > 1.

4

Let O be an open subset of W. The (r, q)-capacity of O is deﬁned to be

Capr,q(O) = inf{kF kr,q : F ∈ Dr,q, F > 1 on O, F > 0 on W for P−a.s.}.

For a general subset A ⊂ W, its (r, q)-capacity is deﬁned to be

Capr,q(A) = inf{Capr,q(O) : O open, A ⊂ O}.

(2.1)

It is not hard to see that the (r, q)-capacity is non-negative, increasing and
sub-additive. Moreover, the following inequality holds:

P(A)

1

q = Cap0,q(A) 6 Capr,q(A), ∀A ∈ B(W ).

Therefore, capacities are ﬁner scales in measuring the size of a set from an
analytic view point than the underlying probability measure.

According to Malliavin, a slim set is a subset having zero (r, q)-capacity for
every (r, q). A property on paths is said to hold quasi-surely if it holds outside
a slim set. We are interested in properties which hold quasi-surely.

We will also be working with functions that are deﬁned quasi-surely. A
function f on W is said to be (r, q)-quasi-continuous if for every ε > 0, there
exists an open subset O ⊂ W , such that Capr,q(O) < ε and f |Oc is continuous.
A main property for quasi-continuous functions that we will be using is a version
of Chebyshev’s inequality (see [18], Theorem 2.2):

Capr,q(|f | > R) 6

Mr,qkf kr,q

R

, R > 0,

(2.2)

for any (r, q)-quasi-continuous function f ∈ Dr,q, where Mr,q is a constant de-
pending only on r and q.

Now we are in a position to formulate our main result.
The basic object we are interested in is the Brownian rough path

w = (1, w1, w2) :

[0, 1] → G2(Rd) = exp(cid:0)Rd ⊕ [Rd, Rd](cid:1)

in dimension d > 2, which is the canonical lifting of Brownian motion to the free
nilpotent Lie group of order 2 over Rd. Heuristically, through the logarithmic
diﬀeomorphism onto the Lie algebra, the Brownian rough path w is equivalent
to the process

which is the original Brownian motion coupled with its Lévy area process.

In rough path theory, it is an important result of Lyons [16] that any rough
path X with roughness p (or a p-rough path) extends uniquely to a continuous
path X taking values in the algebra

T ((Rd)) = R ⊕ Rd ⊕ (Rd)⊗2 ⊕ · · ·

5

of tensor series, such that the projection of X onto the truncated tensor algebra
up to every degree n > ⌊p⌋ has ﬁnite p-variation. Here the truncated tensor
algebra T (n)(Rd) is equipped with the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. Lyons’ lifting X
of a rough path X is also known as the signature path of X. This is a generalized
notion of taking iterated path integrals in each degree, and the signature is just
the end point of the signature path (see (1.1)).

According to Inahama [12] (see also [3]), the Brownian rough path is quasi-
surely well deﬁned as the limit of the lifting of dyadic piecewise linear interpo-
lation of Brownian motion under p-variation metric for 2 < p < 3. Therefore,
from Lyons’ extension theorem, the Brownian signature path and the signature
are well deﬁned quasi-surely.
Remark 2.1. Due to the multiplicative structure in T ((Rd)), a rough path X can
either mean an actual path Xt indexed by a single parameter t or a multiplicative
functional Xs,t indexed by a pair s 6 t. These two notions are interchangeable
with each other by setting Xs,t = X−1
s ⊗ Xt and Xt = X0,t. In this paper,
except for the situation in which we write down the notation explicitly with a
double subscript, when referring to a rough path or a signature path, we always
mean the actual path with one single parameter.

Our main result can be stated as follows.

Theorem 2.1. For n ∈ N, deﬁne

On = {w ∈ W : Sn(w)0,s = Sn(w)0,t for some 0 6 s < t 6 1},

where Sn(w)0,t is the truncated Brownian signature path up to degree n. Then
On has zero (r, q)-capacity provided

(cid:18) n + d − 1

n

(cid:19) > rq + 4.

In particular, the Brownian signature path is non-self-intersecting quasi-surely.

Remark 2.2. Takeda [21] proved that if d > rq + 4, outside a set of zero (r, q)-
capacity every sample path of Brownian motion is non-self-intersecting. This
corresponds to the case of n = 1 in Theorem 2.1. Therefore, our main result
extends Takeda’s result to the higher degree situation.

The non-self-intersection of the Brownian signature path has an important
geometric interpretation on the Brownian rough path, which corresponds to
the non-degeneracy property mentioned in the introduction and arises naturally
from the uniqueness of signature problem in rough path theory. According to [2],
this non-degeneracy property can be made precise by using the language of a real
tree. Recall that a real tree is a metric space τ in which every two distinct points
can be joined by a unique non-self-intersecting path (up to reparametrization),
and this path is a geodesic.
A continuous path x :

[0, 1] → X in some topological space X is called
[0, 1] → τ
tree-like, if there exists a real tree τ, and two continuous maps α :
and β : τ → X such that α(0) = α(1) and x = β ◦ α. In other words, a tree-like

6

path is a path which can be realized as a loop in some real tree. A tree-like
piece of a continuous path x is a pair s < t such that x|[s,t] is tree-like.

From the feature of a real tree, it is clear that the aforementioned non-
degeneracy property means the fact that a path does not have any tree-like
pieces.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A continuous path is called tree-reduced if it does not have any
tree-like pieces.

It is clear that if a path is non-self-intersecting, then it is tree-reduced.
According to the deterministic uniqueness result for signature in [2], we know
that a weakly geometric rough path (a continuous path in the free nilpotent
group of order ⌊p⌋ with ﬁnite p-variation for some p > 1) is tree-like if and only if
it has trivial signature. Therefore, a tree-like piece in a rough path corresponds
to a loop in its signature path and vice versa.
It follows immediately that
Theorem 2.1 is equivalent to the following, which is already interesting on its
own.

Theorem 2.2. The Brownian rough path is tree-reduced quasi-surely.

Another important consequence of Theorem 2.1 is a quasi-sure uniqueness
result for the signature of Brownian motion.
In the uniqueness of signature
aspect, this partially extends the work of Le Jan and Qian [14] to the capacity
setting. Note that their original work is stronger than uniqueness as it gives an
explicit way to reconstruct a sample path of Brownian motion from its signature
.

Theorem 2.3. Outside a slim set N ⊂ W, two sample paths w and w′ of Brow-
nian motion have the same signature if and only if they diﬀer from each other by
a reparametrization. In other words, quasi-surely every sample path of Brownian
motion is uniquely determined by its signature up to reparametrization.

3 Proof of the Main Theorem

In this section, we are going to develop the proof of Theorem 2.1 and point
out how Theorem 2.3 follows easily from this and the deterministic uniqueness
result for signature.

Along the general ideas in the aforementioned works of Kakutani, Fukushima
and Takeda, our proof of Theorem 2.1 contains three main steps: a large devia-
tion type capacity estimate for the maximal functional on the signature path, a
small ball capacity estimate for the signature path, and a subdivision argument.
A crucial point in our proof is a general and useful technique in rough path
theory on controlling higher degree signature components. It consists of a quan-
titative statement of Lyons’ lifting theorem and a technique used by Hambly
and Lyons [11] in the construction of stochastic area for Brownian motion on
the Sierpinski gasket. We state the result as follows and refer the reader to the
monograph by Lyons and Qian [17] for its proof.

Theorem 3.1. Let X = (1, X 1, · · · , X ⌊p⌋) be a p-rough path.

(1) Suppose that X = (1, X 1, X 2, · · · ) is the signature path of X. If there

exists a control function ω(s, t) such that

then the inequality (3.1) holds for all i > ⌊p⌋ as well.

ﬁnite partitions of [s, t].

As we are interested in the Brownian rough path, throughout the rest, we
always ﬁx 2 < p < 3 and the two constants β, γ arising from Theorem 3.1. For
simplicity, we always omit the dependence on p, β and γ for a constant, and the
value of a constant may change from line to line even the same notation is used.

3.1 A Maximal Type Capacity Estimate

As the ﬁrst step, we are going to estimate the (r, q)-capacity of the event {w :
maxt∈[t0,t1] kSn(w)0,t − Sn(w)0,t0 k > η}, where [t0, t1] is a dyadic sub-interval
[t0, t1] = [(k − 1)/2m, k/2m] for some k, m). Our main idea is to
of [0, 1] (i.e.
control the maximal function by the series deﬁned by (3.3), and to observe that
the increments wi

s,t (i = 1, 2) are “evenly distributed” over a dyadic partition.

For m > 1, let w(m) = (1, w(m),1, w(m),2) be the lifting of the dyadic piece-
wise linear interpolation of w|[t0,t1] over the dyadic partition of [t0, t1] into small
intervals of length 1/2m. In other words, w(m),1 is just the increment process of
the interpolation, while w(m),2 is deﬁned by second order iterated integrals of
the interpolation.

(2) From the multiplicative property of a rough path, we know that

Therefore, for any δ > 0, we have

Now (3.7) follows immediately.

Remark 3.1. In the probability measure case (i.e. r = 0), it is possible to
strengthen the maximal inequalities in Proposition 3.1 to an exponential type
by using a Fernique type estimate for the p-variation of the Brownian rough
path. However, this approach cannot be applied to the capacity case as the
Chebyshev inequality for capacity involves the Sobolev norm instead of the Lq-
norm. Indeed, it is even not clear whether the p-variation is diﬀerentiable in the
sense of Malliavin.

3.2 A Small Ball Capacity Estimate

The second step is to establish an estimate for the (r, q)-capacity of the event
{w : |Sn(w)0,t1 −Sn(w)0,t0 | 6 η}, where t0, t1 are two dyadic points in [0, 1]. The
key ingredient here is to observe the hypoellipticity of a collection of signature
components regarded as a stochastic diﬀerential equation (short for SDE), so
that the required estimate will follow from the Malliavin calculus for hypoelliptic
SDEs. It should be pointed out that Sn(w)0,t, as a path in the truncated tensor
algebra, is not hypoelliptic as it lives on the free nilpotent Lie group.

Recall from rough path theory (see [7], Proposition 7.8) that the truncated

signature path Sn(w)t0,t satisﬁes the linear diﬀerential equation

(dSn(w)t0,t = Sn(w)t0,t ⊗ dwt,

Sn(w)t0,t0 = 1.

(3.11)

In our case we can either interpret (3.11) as a rough diﬀerential equation or a
Stratonovich type SDE driven by Brownian motion. Under the canonical basis
of Rd, we can write it as

dwI

t0,t = wI ′

t0,t ◦ dwi

(3.12)

13

starting at zero, where I runs over all words over {1, · · · , d} with length at most
n, and I ′ is the word obtained by dropping the last letter i. We are interested
in a consistent collection I of words in the sense that I ∈ I =⇒ I ′ ∈ I.

Deﬁnition 3.1. A word I over {1, · · · , d} is said to be non-degenerate if it has
the form

I =i0, i1, · · · , i1
}
{z

l1 copies

|

 ,

}

, · · · , ik, · · · , ik

lk copies

|

{z

where 1 6 i0 < i1 < · · · < ik 6 d and l1, · · · , lk > 0.

The collection Id,n of non-degenerate words with length at most n is clearly

consistent.

Lemma 3.3. The cardinality of Id,n is given by

|Id,n| =(cid:18) n + d − 1

n

(cid:19) .

Proof. For 1 6 k 6 d, let Id,n(k) be the set of words I ∈ Id,n whose ﬁrst letter
is k. It is not hard to see that there is a bijection between Id,n(k) and the set
of non-negative integer solutions to the equation

xk+1 + · · · + xd + y = n − 1.

It follows that

Therefore,

|Id,n| =

(cid:19) .

d − k

|Id,n(k)| =(cid:18) n − 1 + d − k
dXk=1(cid:18) n − 1 + d − k

(cid:19) =

d − k

The last expression is easily seen to be(cid:18) n + d − 1

n

n+d−1Xl=n (cid:18) l − 1
n − 1 (cid:19) .
(cid:19) as it can be modeled by

choosing subsets of {1, · · · , n + d − 1} with n elements and with l being the
largest one.

Now we have the following result.

Lemma 3.4. The restriction of (3.12) to the collection Id,n of non-degenerate
words deﬁnes an |Id,n|-dimensional linear SDE satisfying Hörmander’s condi-
tion at the origin in the sense that the linear span of its generating vector ﬁelds
and their Lie brackets of any order at the origin is R|Id,n|.

14

Proof. First of all, the consistency of Id,n implies that the restriction of (3.12)
to Id,n is itself a linear SDE of dimension |Id,n|. It suﬃces to verify Hörmander’s
condition at the origin.

We use the notation X k;I for a component to keep track of the length k of
the word I ∈ Id,n. In geometric notation, the generating vector ﬁelds of the
SDE (3.12) restricted to Id,n are given by

Vi =XIi

xk−1;I ′

i ∂k;Ii , 1 6 i 6 d,

where we set x0;I ′
last letter is i, and I ′

i = 1. Here the sum is taken over all words Ii ∈ Id,n whose
i is the word obtained by dropping the last letter from Ii.

We write

where

Vi = ∂1;(i) + Pi,

Pi = X|Ii|>2

xk−1;I ′

i ∂k;Ii

is a vector ﬁeld with homogeneous linear coeﬃcients. For 1 6 i < j 6 d, we
then have

[Vi, Vj] = [∂1;(i) + Pi, ∂1;(j) + Pj ]

= ∂1;(i)Pj − ∂1;(j)Pi + [Pi, Pj]
= ∂2;(i,j) − ∂1;(j)Pi + [Pi, Pj],

where the ∂P denotes the vector ﬁeld obtained by diﬀerentiating the coeﬃcients
of P.

Now the key observation is that if i 6 j, then Pi does not depend on x1;(j).
Indeed, if this is not the case, then Ii = (j, i) has to be a word appearing in the
summation, contradicting the construction of Id,n. Therefore,

and we have

∂1;(j)Pi = 0

[Vi, Vj] = ∂2;(i,j) + [Pi, Pj].

Note that [Pi, Pj] is a vector ﬁeld with homogeneous linear coeﬃcients of the
form xk−1;I ′

i or xl−1;I ′

j (k, l > 2).

If 1 6 i < j1 6 j2 6 d, then

[[Vi, Vj1 ], Vj2 ] = [∂2;(i,j1) + [Pi, Pj1 ], ∂1;(j2) + Pj2 ]

= ∂3;(i,j1,j2) − ∂1;j2 [Pi, Pj1 ] + [[Pi, Pj1 ], Pj2 ].

Again we know that the second term on the right hand side vanishes as [Pi, Pj1 ]
does not depend on x1;(j2).

By an induction argument, we obtain the fact that

[· · · [[Vi, Vj1 ], Vj2 ], · · · , Vjm ] = ∂m+1;(i,j1,··· ,jm) + Pi,j1,··· ,jm,

15

for all 1 6 i < j1 6 · · · 6 jm 6 d and 1 6 m 6 n − 1, where

Pi,j1,··· ,jm = [· · · [[Pi, Pj1 ], Pj2 ], · · · , Pjm ]

is a vector ﬁeld with homogeneous linear coeﬃcients not depending on any x1;(j)
with j > jm. In particular,

Pi,j1,··· ,jm(0) = 0

and we conclude that the linear span of Vi and their Lie brackets at the origin
coincides with Span{∂k;I : I ∈ Id,n}, which is R|Id,n|.

According to Lemma 3.4 and Hörmander’s theorem from the Malliavin cal-
culus, we know that the law of (wI
t0,t)I∈Id,n has a smooth density with respect
to the Lebesgue measure. A small ball probability estimate follows immediately
from this fact. To obtain a corresponding capacity estimate, we need to the
following lemma.

Proof. Let ew(m) be the lifting of the m-th dyadic piecewise linear interpolation
by replacing w by ew(m). According to Theorem 3.1, we have
ωm(s, t) 6 C(cid:16)ρ1(ew(m); s, t) + ρ2(ew(m); s, t)(cid:17) ,

Now we are able to establish the required small ball capacity estimate.

Proposition 3.2. Given any τ > 1, we have the following estimate:

Cr,q,n,d,τ

for every 0 < η < 1 and n ∈ N, where Cr,q,n,d,τ is a constant depending only on
r, q, n, d and τ.

Proof. Write Xt0,t = (wI
structure of the signature path and the fact that kSn(w)0,t0 k > 1, we have

t0,t)I∈Id,n as a diﬀusion in R|Id,n|. By the multiplicative

6 Capr,q (kXt0,t1k 6 η) .

Now consider a function f ∈ C∞(R|Id,n|) such that

obtain that

(3.15)

Moreover, the same reason as in the proof of Proposition 3.1 shows that F is

17

for any τ > 1, we have

Capr,q(kXt0,t1k 6 η) 6 Capr,q(F > 1)

Finally, according to Lemma 3.4 and Hörmander’s theorem from the Malli-

has a smooth density pt0,t1 (x) with respect to the Lebesgue measure on R|Id,n|.
In particular, pt0,t1(x) satisﬁes the following estimate:

3.3 Kakutani’s Sub-division Argument

Following the original sub-division argument of Kakutani [13], we are now in a
position to complete the proof of Theorem 2.1.

Here a remarkable fact that we are going to use is the sub-additivity for
the q-th power of the (r, q)-capacity (up to a constant depending only on r, q)
instead of the original sub-additivity. This sub-additivity can be easily seen by
using the renowned Meyer’s inequalities and the integral representation formula
(see [19], Chapter 4)

(I − L)− r

2 =

1

Γ(r/2) ˆ ∞

0

e−tt

r

2 −1Ttdt,

where L is the generator of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup Tt. If we use
the sub-additivity for the capacity itself, we will end up with the quantitative
constraint |Id,n| > rq + 4q for the non-self-intersection property, which is not as
sharp as the version we are going to obtain.

18

Proof of Theorem 2.1. Fix two dyadic sub-intervals [s0, s1], [t0, t1] with equal
length ∆ and s1 < t0. Let An be the event that Sn(w)0,s = Sn(w)0,t for some
s ∈ [s0, s1] and t ∈ [t0, t1]. It follows that

An ⊆ {w : kSn(w)0,s0 − Sn(w)0,t0 k 6 2η}

[{w : max

t06t6t1

kSn(w)0,s − Sn(w)0,s0 k > η}

kSn(w)0,t − Sn(w)0,t0 k > η}

for every η > 0. Combining with Proposition 3.1 and Proposition 3.2, we have

(3.16)

for any τ > 1, N > r, δ > 0 and small η.

Now we divide the intervals [s0, s1] and [t0, t1] into dyadic sub-intervals with
length ∆/2l. Note that any I ⊆ [s0, s1] and J ⊆ [t0, t1] are separated from each
other by distance at least t0 − s1. Therefore, by applying (3.16) to the dyadic
sub-intervals, we obtain that

·(cid:16)1 + 2−N ql(1−2σ(1+δ))(cid:17) .

(3.17)

To expect that the right hand side goes to zero as l → ∞, we choose the

parameters τ, δ and σ such that

and

σ(cid:18) |Id,n|

τ

− rq(cid:19) > 2

1 − 2σ(1 + δ) > 0.

19

This is equivalent to

2

|Id,n|/τ − rq

< σ <

1

2(1 + δ)

,

(3.18)

provided that the left hand side is positive. As τ > 1 and δ > 0 is arbitrary,
when

|Id,n| > rq + 4,

a choice of parameters satisfying (3.18) is certainly possible. Therefore, after
choosing τ, δ and σ, when N is large we conclude that the right hand side of
(3.17) converges to zero as l → ∞. In other words, we have

Capr,q(An) = 0.

On the other hand, if Sn(w)0,s = Sn(w)0,t for some s < t, apparently there
exist two disjoint dyadic sub-intervals [s0, s1] and [t0, t1] containing s and t
respectively. Therefore,

Capr,q(On) = 0,

which gives the ﬁrst assertion of Theorem 2.1.

To prove the second assertion, let O be the event that the Brownian signature

path has self-intersection at some 0 6 s < t 6 1. Then we have

O ⊆ \n>1

On.

Therefore, O has zero (r, q)-capacity for every r and q. In other words, O is a
slim set.

Based on the deterministic uniqueness result for signature in [2], it is not
hard to see that the quasi-sure uniqueness for the signature of Brownian motion
(Theorem 2.3) is a direct consequence of Theorem 2.1.

Proof of Theorem 2.3. From [2], Theorem 4.1, we know that the space of signa-
tures for weakly geometric p-rough paths has a canonical real tree structure. In
particular, if g is the signature of some weakly geometric p-rough path X, then

there exists a unique weakly geometric p-rough path eX (up to reparametriza-

tion) such that its signature is g and its signature path is non-self-intersecting.
In our case, let N be the slim set outside which every Brownian signature
path is non-self-intersecting. Suppose w, w′ ∈ N c are two sample paths of
Brownian motion with the same signature. It follows that the corresponding
rough paths w and w′ diﬀer by a reparametrization, and hence w are w′ diﬀer
by a reparametrization. Therefore, quasi-surely every sample path of Brownian
motion is uniquely determined by its signature up to reparametrization.

4 Final Remarks

We give a few remarks to conclude our paper.

First of all, from the details of the proof, it is not hard to see that our tech-
nique is robust as it only involves the Gaussian nature of Brownian motion and
the structure of its covariance function. In particular, its explicit distribution,
martingale property and Markov property are not used at all. Therefore, our
work extends to any Gaussian rough path under the intrinsic capacities induced
by the underlying Gaussian measure over the associated abstract Wiener space,
for the cases where the Gaussian rough path X is well deﬁned quasi-surely and
Hörmander’s theorem for rough diﬀerential equations driven by X is applica-
ble. A fundamental example where everything works is the fractional Brownian
motion BH with Hurst parameter H > 1/4.

On the other hand, one might ask if we could strengthen Theorem 2.1 to
the intrinsic dimension of the truncated signature path Sn(w)0,t instead of re-
stricting it to the collection Id,n of components. Indeed, it is known that (see
[7]) Sn(w)0,t satisﬁes an intrinsic hypoelliptic diﬀerential equation

dSn(w)0,t =

dXi=1

Ui(Sn(w)0,t) ◦ dwi
t

on the free nilpotent Lie group Gn(Rd) of order n over Rd. Therefore, it is
reasonable to expect that Sn(w)0,t is non-self-intersecting outside a set of zero
(r, q)-capacity provided

dim Gn(Rd) > rq + 4.

This will be sharper as |Id,n| grows with rate nd while dim Gn(Rd) grows with
rate dn/n as n → ∞. However, what is missing is the analysis on the vector
ﬁelds Ui in order to guarantee a priori estimates on the density which is needed
in our proof. This is non-trivial as the vector ﬁelds are in fact polynomial of
degree n when pulled back to the free nilpotent Lie algebra. It is not clear how
to develop a localization method which is consistent with our argument. We do
not pursue this direction because unlike the full signature path, the truncated
signature path up to a given degree does not have a natural interpretation on
the geometric behavior of the Brownian rough path.

However, the case when n = 2 is particularly interesting because it is just

the Brownian rough path. In this case,

dim G2(Rd) = |Id,2| =

d2 + d

2

.

Based on the works of Dvoretzky, Erdős and Kakutani [6] and Lyons [15] as
we mentioned in the introduction, it is natural to expect that the Brownian
rough path has self-intersection with positive probability when d = 2 while it is
non-self-intersecting outside a set of zero (1, 2)-capacity when d = 3. Moreover,
it is even not unreasonable to expect that the Brownian rough path is non-self-
intersecting outside a set of zero (r, 2)-capacity if and only if d2 + d > 4r + 8.
