We adapt Forman’s discretization of Ricci curvature to the case of undirected networks, both
weighted and unweighted, and investigate the measure in a variety of model and real-world net-
works. We ﬁnd that most nodes and edges in model and real networks have a negative curvature.
Furthermore, the distribution of Forman curvature of nodes and edges is narrow in random and
small-world networks, while the distribution is broad in scale-free and real-world networks. In most
networks, Forman curvature is found to display signiﬁcant negative correlation with degree and
centrality measures. However, Forman curvature is uncorrelated with clustering coeﬃcient in most
networks. Importantly, we ﬁnd that both model and real networks are vulnerable to targeted dele-
tion of nodes with highly negative Forman curvature. Our results suggest that Forman curvature
can be employed to gain novel insights on the organization of complex networks.

INTRODUCTION

Complex networks [1–6] pervade our everyday life. These range from biological networks [7] such as metabolic
network [8] representing interactions among metabolites and enzymes responsible for growth and maintenance of a
cell, to transportation networks [9] such as the road, rail and airline network linking cities across the world, to social
networks such as Facebook [10] linking individuals based on their friendships. A key goal of network theory is to
characterize the structure of networks and investigate structure-function relationships [1–6].

In this direction, a focus has been the geometrical characterization of model and real-world networks [11–19]. In
geometry, curvature plays a central role, since it represents a measure to quantify the deviation of a geometrical object
from being ﬂat. Given the essential role of curvature in diﬀerential geometry wherefrom this notion originated, the
search for its analogue in various generalized settings, and in particular, in the discrete case is only natural. However,
only with the advent of computer science and modern graph theory did this drive attend maturity (see below).

Sectional curvature is the most expressive classical curvature, that has proved to be extremely fruitful leading
to signiﬁcant generalizations in geometry (see, for example [20, 21] and references therein). However, the sectional
curvature with the notable exception of combinatorial curvature (or angular defect), has turned out to be less fruitful in
the context of graph theory. Combinatorial curvature has led to several applications in graph theory, computational
geometry, graphics and imaging.
In particular, the role of combinatorial curvature in studying the properties of
various types of networks has been realized and exploited, even if, in many cases, only in the simplest form of
clustering coeﬃcient [11]. Shortly, a number of other more elaborate and geometric types of sectional curvature have
also been considered [17, 22–24].

In contrast to sectional curvature, Ricci curvature is a more abstract and less intuitive concept. The work of
Grigori Perelman on the geometrization conjecture [25, 26] has led to renewed interest in Ricci curvature and its
discretizations. Ricci curvature has proved to be more versatile and ﬂexible compared to sectional curvature, rendering
many discretizations for graphs and alike structures [27–35].

In particular, Ollivier’s discretization of the Ricci curvature [12, 36, 37] has proven to be successful for both
conceptual advances [13–16, 38] and practical applications [18, 19, 39] in the domain of networks. However, Ollivier-
Ricci curvature has some limitations. Ollivier-Ricci curvature necessitates the calculation of the earth mover’s distance
or Wasserstein 1-metric, and this in practice requires solving a linear programming problem. Thus, the calculation
of Ollivier-Ricci curvature is computationally intensive and may be forbidden for very large networks. Ollivier-Ricci
curvature has formal basis in optimal transport theory, and thus, Ollivier’s curvature is well suited to investigate
information transfer in communication networks. However, Ollivier-Ricci curvature may be less suited to investigate
interaction networks such as protein-protein interactions.

dimensional face), or a parent (i.e., a higher dimensional face), but not both simultaneously. The edges ev1 , e(cid:48)

In this paper, we introduce another discretization of the classical Ricci curvature proposed by R. Forman [40] to the
domain of complex networks. Remarkably, Forman’s curvature for complex networks is enticingly simple to compute in
large-scale networks. Forman’s curvature is general and ﬂexible which renders it suitable for most situations. Notably,
unlike clustering coeﬃcient, Forman’s curvature is deﬁned for any edge in the network, and does not presume the
existence of triads or triangles in the graph. Moreover, the deﬁnition of Forman’s curvature elegantly incorporates
the weights of edges and nodes in the network. Hence, Forman’s curvature is suitable to study both unweighted and
weighted networks.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In section II, we introduce the Forman curvature for networks.
In section III, we describe the model and real networks used to investigate the Forman curvature for networks, while
section IV contains our main results. We conclude, in section V, with suggestions for future extensions and possible
applications.

II. DEFINITION OF FORMAN CURVATURE FOR NETWORKS

In this section, we introduce Forman curvature to the realm of complex networks, and present the mathematical

formula to compute the Forman curvature in undirected networks.

Forman’s [40] discretization of the classical Ricci curvature holds for a broad class of geometric objects, the so
called (regular ) CW complexes [41, 42]. A full deﬁnition of this notion is out of the scope of this paper, and the
interested reader is directed to Forman’s article [40] for details. Here, we only wish to emphasize that the broad
class of geometric objects for which Forman’s discretization of the classical Ricci curvature holds include polyhedra,
triangular meshes, and most important for this work, (locally ﬁnite) graphs.

It is worthwhile to mention that Forman’s deﬁnition of the classical Ricci curvature for the case of cell complexes is
based on a proper interpretation of the so called Bochner-Weitzenb¨ock formula. Again the mathematical expression
of the Forman-Ricci curvature is extremely technical and less relevant in the present context of networks, and the
interested reader may refer for example [43] for details. We remark that, in the classical context, the Forman Ricci
curvature gives the relationship between the Riemannian good Laplacian and the so-called rough Laplacian, in terms of
a complicated expression containing the curvatures of the manifold. Simply stated, it corrects the standard Laplacian
which is also known as the Laplace-Beltrami operator, in terms of the curvatures of the underlying manifold. Since
Laplacian plays a key role in heat equation (see, e.g. [43]), one can gain some physical intuition by realizing that the
heat evolution on a curved metal plate diﬀers from that on a planar plate in a manner that is evidently dependent on
the shape (i.e., curvature) of the plate. We also suggest possible applications of the Forman’s version of the Laplacian
in our concluding remarks.

Due to the technical nature of the Forman-Ricci curvature, we choose not to present here the expression for Forman’s
curvature in its general form, but would rather restrict ourselves to highlighting the following important point. Ricci
curvature operates directionally along vectors. A direct consequence of this fact is that, in our discrete setting,
Forman’s curvature is associated with the discrete analogue of a vector, namely, edges.

Forman curvature for an edge (which is in dimension 1) is given by the following formula:

where

• e denotes the edge under consideration between two nodes v1 and v2.
• we denotes the weight of the edge e under consideration.
• wv1 and wv2 denote the weights associated with the nodes v1 and v2, respectively.
• ev1 ∼ e and ev2 ∼ e denote the set of edges incident on nodes v1 and v2, respectively, after excluding the edge e
under consideration which connects the two nodes v1 and v2 (see Figure 1).

Note that by deﬁnition this notion of curvature is intrinsically associated with edges, and thus, Forman curvature is
inherently suited to networks. Also, this notion of curvature does not necessitate any artiﬁce such as extending a
measure for the curvature of nodes to the edges.

On the other hand, while Forman curvature is essentially deﬁned on edges (as it represents a discretization of Ricci

curvature), it can be elegantly extended to nodes as follows:

(cid:88)

F(v) =

1

deg(v)

ev ∼ v

F(ev)

(2)

where ev denotes the set of edges incident on the node v and deg(v) denotes the degree of node v. This deﬁnition of
the Forman curvature of nodes in network is handy because several standard measures (such as degree and clustering
coeﬃcient) to characterize the structure of networks are deﬁned for the nodes. Thus, the deﬁnition of the Forman
curvature of nodes enables a comparative analysis with other node based network measures.

A full explanation of the formula above, in particular of the role of parallel edges, is beyond the scope of the
present paper, and we refer the interested reader to Forman’s original article [40]. However, we provide an intuitive
interpretation of Forman curvature in the Appendix.

III. DATASET OF MODEL AND REAL NETWORKS

We have analyzed the Forman curvature in diverse networks which include both model and real-world networks. In

this study, we have considered the following generative models for networks:

• Erd¨os-R´enyi (ER) model [44] is widely used to generate random graphs. ER model gives an ensemble G(n, p)
of graphs where n is the number of nodes and p is the probability that each possible edge exists between any
pair of nodes in the network.

• Watts-Strogatz (WS) model [1] generates graphs with small-world properties of high clustering coeﬃcient
and small average path length. This model initially starts with a regular ring lattice, a graph with n nodes
where each node is connected to its k nearest neighbors. Next an endpoint of each edge in the regular ring
lattice is rewired with probability β to a new node (which is selected from all possible nodes in the network
with a uniform probability).

• Barab´asi-Albert (BA) model [2] generates scale-free networks with power-law degree distribution. This
growing network model initially starts with a graph of m0 nodes. Next new nodes are added to the initial graph
one at a time, and each new node is connected to m ≤ m0 existing nodes with a probability that is proportional
to the degree of existing nodes. Formally, in this preferential attachment model, the probability pi that the new
node is connected to existing node i is given by

ki(cid:80)

,

j kj

pi =

where ki is the degree of existing node i and the sum in the denominator is taken over the degree of all existing
nodes j. Thus, high-degree nodes acquire more edges over time compared to low-degree nodes in this model.

4
• Power-law cluster (PLC) model [45] is an extension of the BA model that generates scale-free networks
with power-law degree distribution and approximate average clustering. Compared to the BA model, the PLC
model contains an extra step where the addition of a random edge between a new node and an exiting node i is
followed by the possibility of adding an edge between the new node and a neighbor of the existing node i. This
extra step in the PLC model renders the formation of triads more likely, and thus, can generate networks with
high average clustering coeﬃcient.

In addition to the model networks, we have analyzed the following undirected real-world networks:
• US Power Grid network [46] captures the high-voltage power grid in the western states of USA. In this
network of 4941 nodes and 6594 edges, the nodes are generators or transformers or substations, and the edges
are power supply lines.

• Euro road network [9] represents the international E-road network which is a road network located mostly
in Europe. In this network of 1174 nodes and 1417 edges, the nodes are cities, and the edges are roads linking
them.

• PGP network [47] represents the interaction network of users of the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) algorithm.
In this network of 10680 nodes and 24316 edges, the nodes are users of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) algorithm,
and edges are interactions between the users.

• Email communication network [48] represents the Email communication at the University Rovira i Virgili
in Tarragona in the south of Catalonia in Spain. In this network of 1133 nodes and 5451 edges, the nodes are
users, and the edges represent direct communication between users.

• Yeast protein interactions [49] represents the interactions between proteins of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
In this network of 1870 nodes and 2277 edges, the nodes are proteins, and the edges are interactions between
proteins.

• PDZ domain interactions [50] represents the network of protein–protein interactions obtained from PDZbase.
In this network of 212 nodes and 244 edges, the nodes are proteins, and the edges are PDZ-domain mediated
interactions between proteins.

• Adjective-Noun adjacency network [51] gives the common noun and adjective adjacencies for the novel
David Copperﬁeld written by Charles Dickens. In this network of 112 nodes and 425 edges, the nodes are nouns
or adjectives, and the edges represent their presence in adjacent positions in the novel.

• Jazz musicians network [52] represents the collaboration network between Jazz musicians. In this network
of 198 nodes and 2742 edges, the nodes are Jazz musicians, and the edges represent collaboration between
musicians.

• Facebook network [53] represents the user–user friendships in the online social network Facebook. In this
network of 2888 nodes and 2981 edges, the nodes are users, and the edges represent friendship between users of
Facebook.

• Hamsterster Friendship represents the network of friendships and family links between users of the website
hamsterster.com. In this network of 2426 nodes and 16631 edges, the nodes are users of hamsterster.com, and
the edges represent friendship or family links between users.

• Gnutella [46] captures the Gnutella peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing network from August 2002. In this network of
6301 nodes and 20777 edges, the nodes are hosts in Gnutella network, and the edges are connections between
hosts.

• Human protein interactions [54] represents the initial version of a proteome-scale map of human binary
protein–protein interactions. In this network of 3133 nodes and 6726 edges, the nodes are proteins, and the
edges are interactions between human proteins.

• Noun occurrences in Bible [55] represents the network of nouns (i.e., places and names) in the King James
Bible and information about their occurrences. In this network of 1773 nodes and 9131 edges, the nodes are
nouns, and the edges represent occurrences of nouns in a single verse in Bible. Note unlike other undirected
networks considered here, this undirected network has positive edge weights.

FIG. 2. Distribution of Forman curvature of nodes in model networks. Erd¨os-R´enyi (ER) model with parameters: number of
nodes n = 1000 and probability p that two nodes in the graph are directly connected = 0.003. Watts-Strogratz (WS) model
with parameters: number of nodes n = 1000, each node in the initial ring topology is connected to its k = 5 nearest neighbors,
and probability p of rewiring each edge = 0.5. Barab´asi-Albert (BA) model with parameters: number of nodes n = 1000, and
the number of random edges to be added to each new node m = 3. Power-law cluster (PLC) model with parameters: number
of nodes n = 1000, the number of random edges to be added to each new node m = 3, and probability p of adding a triangle
after adding a random edge = 0.05.

Majority of the above-mentioned undirected real networks were downloaded from the KONECT [56] database (cf.
Supplementary Table S1).

We have analyzed the structure of the considered model and real networks based on several network measures such
as maximum degree, minimum degree, average degree, number of connected components, size of the largest connected
component, mean shortest path length, average clustering coeﬃcient and degree assortativity, and these results are
contained in Supplementary Tables S2-S4. Note that we take the weight of nodes and edges to be 1 while computing
the Forman curvature in unweighted networks.

IV. RESULTS

A. Distribution of Forman curvature in model and real networks

Figure 2 shows the distribution of Forman curvature of nodes in model networks.

It is seen that most nodes
in model networks have negative curvature. Moreover, there is a clear diﬀerence in the nature of distribution of
node curvature in diﬀerent types of model networks. Speciﬁcally, in random networks generated by ER model and
small-world networks generated by WS model, the distribution of node curvature is narrow with most nodes having
curvature close to -4. But in scale-free networks generated by BA model and PLC model, the distribution of node
curvature is broader with several nodes having curvature less than -40. In Supplementary Figure S1, we show the
distribution of Forman curvature of edges in model networks. Similar to nodes, most edges in model networks have
negative curvature. Also, there is a clear diﬀerence in the nature of distribution of edge curvature in diﬀerent types

of model networks. Random networks and small-world networks have a narrow distribution of edge curvature while
scale-free networks have a broader distribution of edge curvature.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of Forman curvature of nodes in real networks. It is seen that most nodes in real
networks have negative curvature. Moreover, the analyzed real networks have a broad distribution of node curvature.
By comparing distributions of node curvature in model and real networks (cf. Figures 2 and 3), it is clear that the
nature of distribution in real networks is closer to that for scale-free networks. These ﬁndings are consistent with
well-known result that most real-world networks have a scale-free architecture with power-law degree distribution
[3]. In Supplementary Figure S2, we show the distribution of Forman curvature of edges in analyzed real networks.
Similar to model networks, the distribution of edge curvature in analyzed real networks is similar to the distribution
of node curvature.

Figure 4 shows the network of PDZ-domain mediated protein-protein interactions [50]. It is seen that most nodes

location (i.e., latitude and longitude) on the map of the world. Here, we show a section of the Euro road network limited to
the cities with Forman curvature of nodes ≤ −2 and edges between them. Size of nodes and width of edges are proportional to
the absolute value of the corresponding Forman curvature. Cities with Forman curvature < −7 are labeled here.

and edges in the PDZ network have negative curvature. In the PDZ network, high-degree nodes or hubs and central
nodes or bottlenecks seem to have highly negative curvature. PDZ network is disassortative with negative degree
assortativity, and it can be seen that the high-degree nodes in this network are less likely to be directly connected to
each other.

Figure 5 shows the Euro road network [9] based on the international E-road network connecting cities located
mostly in Europe. Similar to PDZ network, most nodes in the Euro road network have negative curvature. However,
the Euro road network has positive degree assortativity unlike PDZ network, and it can be seen that the high-degree
nodes in this network are more likely to be directly connected to each other.

In the classical Riemannian setting, Ricci curvature controls the growth of volumes (see for example [43, 57]). More
precisely, spaces of negative Ricci curvature have exponential type growth, whereas those of positive Ricci curvature
have a ﬁnite diameter. The same also holds for the Forman’s discretization of the Ricci curvature [40]. Since majority
of the nodes and edges in considered networks essentially display a negative curvature, it follows that these networks
display the potential of inﬁnite growth. This important realization for real networks can be exploited for potential
applications.

B. Forman curvature and common network measures in model and real networks

Degree of a node is given by the number of edges incident to the node in the network. Figure 6 shows the correlation
between degree and Forman curvature of nodes in model networks. We ﬁnd a high negative correlation between node
curvature and node degree in random networks generated by ER model and small-world networks generated by WS
model. However, a weaker negative correlation is obtained between node curvature and node degree in scale-free
networks generated by BA model and PLC model. Note that Forman curvature of a node is computed based on
Forman curvature of edges incident on the node, and the Forman curvature of an edge in the network is dependent
on its neighboring edges.

Figure 7 shows the correlation between degree and Forman curvature of nodes in real networks.

Interestingly,
high negative correlation between node curvature and node degree is found in transportation and communication
networks such as US Power Grid, Euro road and Email communication, while a weaker negative correlation between
node curvature and node degree is found in biological networks such as Yeast protein interactions and PDZ domain
interactions. Supplementary Table S5 summarizes the results of these analyses between Forman curvature and degree

of nodes in model and real networks.

In Supplementary Figure S3, we plot the value of correlation between Forman curvature and degree of nodes in real
networks as a function of degree assortativity of considered networks. This ﬁgure suggests that disassortative networks
such as Yeast protein interactions and PDZ domain interactions have weaker correlation between node curvature and
node degree. Moreover, communication and transportation networks with positive degree assortativity have high
correlation between node curvature and node degree. In future, it will be worthwhile to expand the investigation of
the observed relationship between degree assortativity and value of correlation between Forman curvature and degree
of nodes to other networks.

Clustering coeﬃcient [1, 58] of a node is given by the number of edges that are realized between the neighbors of
the node divided by the number of edges that could possibly exist between the neighbors of the node in the network.
Clustering coeﬃcient quantiﬁes the tendency of nodes to cluster together in a network. Figure 8 shows the correlation
between clustering coeﬃcient and Forman curvature of nodes in model networks.
Interestingly, no correlation is
obtained between Forman curvature and clustering coeﬃcient of nodes in random networks generated by ER model
and small-world networks generated by WS model. However, a weak negative correlation is obtained between Forman
curvature and clustering coeﬃcient of nodes in scale-free networks generated by BA model and PLC model.

Since clustering coeﬃcient is another measure to quantify curvature in complex networks [11, 59], we investigated
the correlation between degree and clustering coeﬃcient of nodes in model networks (cf. Supplementary Table S6).
We ﬁnd very weak or no correlation between degree and clustering coeﬃcient of nodes in random networks generated
by ER model and small-world networks generated by WS model. Moreover, we ﬁnd a weak negative correlation
between degree and clustering coeﬃcient of nodes in scale-free networks generated by BA model and PLC model.
However, the absolute value of the negative correlation between degree and clustering coeﬃcient of nodes is lower than
the absolute value of the negative correlation between degree and Forman curvature of nodes in scale-free networks
(cf. Supplementary Tables S5 and S6).

Figure 9 shows the correlation between clustering coeﬃcient and Forman curvature of nodes in real networks. It can

be seen that there is either extremely weak or no correlation between clustering coeﬃcient and Forman curvature of
nodes in considered real networks. Also, there is very weak or no correlation between degree and clustering coeﬃcient
of nodes in the analyzed real networks (cf. Supplementary Table S6). Notably, the absolute value of correlation
between degree and Forman curvature of nodes is much higher in real networks compared to the observed correlation
between degree and clustering coeﬃcient of nodes in the same networks (cf. Supplementary Tables S5 and S6).
Presumably, Forman curvature unlike clustering coeﬃcient, has better correlation with degree because this type of
curvature by its deﬁnition captures the geometric properties of the classical notions for smooth spaces discretized by
networks.

Betweenness centrality [4, 60] of a node gives the fraction of shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in the network
that pass through that node. This measure is an indicator of the centrality of a node in the network, and a node
with high betweenness centrality is a bottleneck for ﬂows in the network. Figure 10 shows the correlation between
betweenness centrality and Forman curvature of nodes in model networks. Interestingly, high negative correlation is
obtained between Forman curvature and betweenness centrality of nodes in random networks generated by ER model
and small-world networks generated by WS model. Also, signiﬁcant negative correlation is obtained between Forman
curvature and betweenness centrality of nodes in scale-free networks generated by BA model and PLC model. Figure
11 shows the correlation between betweenness centrality and Forman curvature of nodes in real networks. It can be
seen that there is a weak to high negative correlation between betweenness centrality and Forman curvature of nodes
in considered real networks.

We have also studied the correlation between Forman curvature and two other centrality measures, eigenvector
centrality [61] and closeness centrality [62, 63], in model and real networks. Similar to betweenness centrality, we ﬁnd
a high negative correlation between Forman curvature and closeness (or eigenvector) centrality of nodes in considered
model networks (cf. Supplementary Table S5). Also, we ﬁnd a clear negative correlation between Forman curvature
and closeness (or eigenvector) centrality of nodes in analyzed real networks (cf. Supplementary Table S5).

Since clustering coeﬃcient is another measure to quantify curvature in complex networks, we have also investigated
the correlation between betweenness, closeness or eigenvector centrality and clustering coeﬃcient of nodes in model
and real networks (cf. Supplementary Table S6). We ﬁnd in majority of considered model and real networks, there is
no or weak correlation between betweenness, closeness or eigenvector centrality and clustering coeﬃcient of nodes (cf.
Supplementary Table S6). Moreover, there is a clear lack of consistent trend in the correlation between betweenness,
closeness or eigenvector centrality and clustering coeﬃcient of nodes in considered model and real networks (cf.

measures compared to clustering coeﬃcient.

C. Forman curvature and topological robustness of networks

We next investigated the eﬀect of removing nodes based on increasing order of their Forman curvature on the
large-scale connectivity of networks. Figure 12 shows the size of the largest connected component in model networks
as a function of the number of nodes removed. Here, the order of removing nodes is based on the following criteria: (a)
Random order, (b) Increasing order of Forman curvature (i.e, starting from the node with most negative curvature),
and (c) Decreasing order of clustering coeﬃcient (i.e, starting from the node with highest clustering coeﬃcient). By
comparing the eﬀect of random removal against Forman curvature based removal in Figure 12, it is clear that targeted
removal of nodes with highly negative Forman curvature leads to faster disintegration compared to random removal of
nodes in model networks. Moreover, it is found that removal of nodes based on increasing order of Forman curvature
leads to faster disintegration compared to removal of nodes based on decreasing order of clustering coeﬃcient in model
networks.

Figure 13 shows the size of the largest connected component in real networks as a function of the number of
nodes removed. Similar to model networks, we ﬁnd that targeted removal of nodes with highly negative Forman
curvature leads to faster disintegration compared to random removal of nodes in real networks. Also, we ﬁnd that
removal of nodes based on increasing order of Forman curvature leads to faster disintegration compared to removal
of nodes based on decreasing order of clustering coeﬃcient in real networks. Our results suggest that nodes with
highly negative Forman curvature seem more important than nodes with high clustering coeﬃcient to maintain the
large-scale connectivity of model and real networks.

Earlier work [2–4, 8, 49, 64, 65] has shown that diverse networks are vulnerable to targeted removal of nodes
with high degree or high betweenness centrality. Thus, we decided to compare the eﬀect of removing nodes based
on increasing order of their Forman curvature against removing nodes based on decreasing order of their degree or
betweenness centrality on the large-scale connectivity of networks (cf. Supplementary Figures S4 and S5). We ﬁnd
that the removal of nodes based on decreasing order of degree or betweenness centrality leads to faster disintegration
compared to removal of nodes based on increasing order of Forman curvature in considered model and real networks
(cf. Supplementary Figures S4 and S5). Thus, nodes with highly negative Forman curvature are more important
than nodes with high clustering coeﬃcient for maintenance of the overall connectivity of model and real networks,
but such nodes with highly negative Forman curvature are less important compared to nodes with high degree or high
betweenness centrality.

D. Forman curvature and weighted networks

The deﬁnition of Forman curvature (Equation 1) elegantly incorporates the weights of nodes and edges in networks,
and this feature renders Forman curvature an attractive measure to study the organization of complex networks.
Notice that the clustering coeﬃcient unlike Forman curvature is unable to account for weights of nodes and edges
in networks. So far, we have reported results based on our investigation of undirected and unweighted networks.
Here, we report the Forman curvature in the network of Noun occurrences in Bible [55] which is a undirected but
positively-weighted network.

Figure 14(a) shows the distribution of Forman curvature of nodes in the network of Noun occurrences in Bible.
It is seen that most nodes have a negative curvature but the distribution is broad with several nodes having highly
negative curvature (≤ -100). Figure 14(b) shows the size of the largest connected component in the network of Noun
occurrences in Bible as a function of the number of nodes removed. In Figure 14(b), the order of removing nodes

of nodes based on increasing order of Forman curvature leads to faster disintegration compared to removal of nodes
based on decreasing order of clustering coeﬃcient in this weighted undirected network.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have introduced here the Forman curvature, which represents a new type of discretization of Ricci curvature,
to the realm of undirected networks. The mathematical formula of the Forman curvature (Equation 1) elegantly
incorporates the weights of nodes and edges in networks. Hence, Forman curvature can be utilized to study the
structure of both unweighted and weighted complex networks.

By investigating the distribution of Forman curvature of nodes and edges in model and real networks, we ﬁnd that
most nodes and edges in considered networks have a negative curvature. The distribution of node curvature and edge
curvature is narrow in both random and small-world networks, while the distribution is broad in scale-free networks.
In real networks, the distribution of node curvature and edge curvature is also broad like scale-free networks. Our
results highlight that the distribution of Ricci curvature enables distinction between the diﬀerent types of model
networks (cf. Figure 2), but also between the diﬀerent types of real networks (cf. Figure 3). This suggests that
Forman curvature can be used to classify diﬀerent types of networks.

We next investigated the correlation between Forman curvature and common network measures including degree,
clustering coeﬃcient and betweenness centrality, in model and real networks. High negative correlation is observed
between Forman curvature and degree in both random and small-world networks, while a weaker negative correlation
is seen in scale-free networks. Among real networks, a high negative correlation between Forman curvature and degree
is found in transportation and communication networks such as US Power Grid, Euro road and Email communication,
while a weaker negative correlation is found in biological networks such as Yeast protein interactions and PDZ domain
interactions. Our extensive analysis of real networks also uncovers a possible relationship between degree assortativity
and value of correlation between Forman curvature and degree. We also ﬁnd a signiﬁcant negative correlation between
Forman curvature and diﬀerent centrality measures including betweenness, eigenvector and closeness centrality in
random, small-world and scale-free networks. In real networks, we ﬁnd a weak to high negative correlation between
Forman curvature and centrality measures.

Clustering coeﬃcient has been used as a reference measure to quantify curvature in complex networks [11, 59]. We
ﬁnd no correlation between Forman curvature and clustering coeﬃcient in random and small-world networks, while
a weak negative correlation was found in scale-free networks. Similarly, there is an extremely weak or no correlation
between Forman curvature and clustering coeﬃcient in analyzed real networks. Our results underline that Forman
curvature has stronger association with degree and centrality measures compared to clustering coeﬃcient.

By investigating the eﬀect of removing nodes based on their Forman curvature on the large-scale connectivity of
networks, we show that both model and real networks are vulnerable to targeted removal of nodes with highly negative
Forman curvature. Moreover, in both model and real networks, node removal based on increasing order of Forman
curvature leads to faster disintegration compared to node removal based on decreasing order of clustering coeﬃcient.
Our results underscore the importance of nodes with highly negative Forman curvature compared to those with high
clustering coeﬃcient for the maintenance of the large-scale connectivity in networks.

Forman’s curvature for networks introduced here like the more established Ollivier’s curvature [12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19]
for networks is a discretization of the the classical Ricci curvature. Previously, Ni et al [18] have studied the Ollivier’s
curvature in both model and real networks. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that our results for Forman’s curvature in networks
are qualitatively similar to those obtained by Ni et al [18] for the Ollivier’s curvature in networks. Like Ni et al [18]
for Ollivier’s curvature, in both model and real networks, we ﬁnd that most nodes and edges have a negative Forman
curvature, and are vulnerable to targeted deletion of nodes with negative Forman curvature. However, the analysis
of Ni et al [18] for Ollivier’s curvature was limited to communication networks among real networks. In contrast, we
have performed an extensive analysis of the Forman curvature that spans across biological, social and communication
networks. Fundamentally, still the qualitative agreement seen between our results for Forman’s curvature and Ni et
al for Ollivier’s curvature, reinforces the strength of both types of curvature for complex networks, and shows that
the two curvatures, both in theoretical and practical sense, represent good discretizations of Ricci curvature.

Strikingly, the formula to compute Forman’s curvature in networks is extremely simple and can easily scale to
very large networks. In contrast, the calculation of Ollivier’s curvature in networks is computationally intensive as
it requires solving a diﬃcult linear programming problem associated with the optimal mass transport. Thus, the
computation of Ollivier’s curvature may be computationally infeasible in extremely large networks. Also, a detailed
comparative analysis of Forman’s curvature and Ollivier’s curvature in diverse networks is a natural follow-up of this

work, but such follow-up analysis will require substantial more eﬀort compared to this work.
Several other natural extensions of the present work can be foreseen in the near future.

In the present work,
we have ported the concept of Forman curvature from diﬀerential geometry to the sphere of undirected networks.
However, several important real-world networks including the world wide web (WWW) [66], metabolic network [8],
gene regulatory network [67] and neural network [68] are inherently directed in nature. An extension of the Forman
curvature to directed edges is necessary for proper investigation of directed networks.

Notice that the mathematical formula of the Forman curvature (Equation 1) contains terms with square root of
node weights and edge weights in the denominator, and thus, the formula of the Forman curvature can only be
utilized to compute curvature in networks with positive weights of nodes and edges. We remark that the formula of
the Forman curvature for edges in networks was derived from a more general formula by Forman which is applicable
to a broad class of geometric objects, and thus, the weights in the present formula correspond to the Riemannian
notions of length, area, volume, etc., considered by Forman which must be positive. However, nodes and edges in
real-world networks such as gene regulatory network [67] and neural network [68] can have negative weights. For
example, negative edge weights in gene regulatory network represent repressive interactions between transcription
factors and regulated genes. Thus, an extension of the Forman curvature to account for negative weights of edges and
nodes will enable proper investigation of signed networks.

We conclude with a suggestion for another possible extension that stems from a theoretical, albeit straightforward,
reﬂection of the mathematical formula of the Forman curvature. As mentioned in section II, the deﬁnition of the
Forman curvature is coupled with two ﬁtting Laplacians. In future, it will be interesting to utilize these Laplacians
associated with the Forman curvature for standard applications of spectral analysis and denoising in large-scale
networks.

Appendix A: Interpretation of Forman curvature

As mentioned in section II, Forman’s discretization of Ricci curvature is derived from the so called Bochner-
Weitzenb¨ock formula, and, as such, its geometric content is, perhaps, less than transparent. However, we can still
gain some insight into this curvature measure by following Forman’s own approach [40]. Forman’s curvature was
devised as a discrete version of the classical Ricci curvature by keeping in mind surfaces and higher dimensional
(smooth) manifolds. Still one can gain intuition on Forman’s curvature by considering the simpler yet relevant case
of two-dimensional surfaces.

A ﬁrst important insight to gain arises from the fact that Ricci curvature is intrinsic. An intrinsic measure is
independent of the embedding in the space, while an extrinsic measure is dependent upon the chosen (or given)
embedding. In the smooth setting, isometric embeddings are formally deﬁned as follows. Let M m, N n be smooth
Riemannian manifolds and let f : M m → N n be a smooth mapping. Then f is called:
• an immersion if df has maximal rank (i.e., equal to m) at every point p ∈ M m.

xe0y..xe0y..xe0yxy..(a)e1e2e4e3e0C1C2(b)17

• an embedding if it is an immersion and a homeomorphism onto its image.
• an isometric embedding if it is an embedding and if it preserves the length of (smooth) curves.

Intuitively, a property (e.g. length, curvature, etc.) is intrinsic if it does not depend upon the speciﬁc realization of
the given geometrical object (e.g. of a surface in Euclidean space). In our context, it means that Forman’s curvature
depends solely on the combinatorial data (i.e., adjacency matrix) and prescribed weights of the network. But Forman’s
curvature is not dependent, for instance, on the way the edges are drawn, say in the plane, and nor on the relative
magnitudes or distribution of the weights. Since in Forman’s original concept, edge weights represent abstractizations
of the notion of length, the connection with the classical notion of intrinsic embedding becomes quite transparent (see
also the discussion below).

Let us now see how this deﬁnition translates into a more discrete setting by considering a square grid shown in
Figure 15(a). For the square grid in Figure 15(a), the following points need to be emphasized. First, in the classical
(smooth manifold) setting, Forman-Ricci curvature is measured along a vector whose discrete analogue is an edge.
Second, the intrinsic distances on the square grid shown in Figure 15(a) need to be identiﬁed. Following Forman [40],
the only edges contributing to the intrinsic distances are the ones parallel to the edge e0 under consideration in Figure
15(a). That is, those edges that either have a common parent (higher dimensional face) or a common child (lower
dimensional face) with edge e0 contribute to the intrinsic distances, but not those edges which have both a common
parent and common child. One can convince themselves about the truth of this assertion by passing to a degenerate
case, namely, by collapsing the incoming (adjacent) edges as shown in Figure 15(b). It can be shown that the parallel
edges are precisely the ones that make a contribution to the meaningful Laplacian which is intrinsically associated
with the Forman-Ricci curvature along the edge e0 (for details see [40]). Thus, based on these observations, one can
regard the Forman-Ricci curvature of an edge as a measure of the weighted ﬂow along the given edge.

In the limiting case of graphs or networks considered here, there are no higher dimensional faces than the one-
dimensional faces which correspond to the edges of the network, and this realization leads to the mathematical
formula (Equation 1) for the Forman curvature of the edge. We remark that the interpretation of the Forman-Ricci
curvature still holds for the case of networks. Namely, the Forman curvature is a measure of the ﬂow across an edge
in the network, as contributed by the edges adjacent to it.
