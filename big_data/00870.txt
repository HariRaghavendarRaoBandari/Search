The Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) and Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) are a
class of pulsars understood as neutron stars (NSs) with super strong surface magnetic
ﬁelds, namely B (cid:38) 1014 G, and for that reason are known as Magnetars. However, in
the last years some SGRs/AXPs with low surface magnetic ﬁelds B ∼ (1012 − 1013) G
have been detected, challenging the Magnetar description. Moreover, some fast and very
magnetic white dwarfs (WDs) have also been observed, and at least one showed X-Ray
energy emission as an ordinary pulsar. Following this fact, an alternative model based
on white dwarfs pulsars has been proposed to explain this special class of pulsars. In
this model, AXPs and SGRs as dense and magnetized white dwarfs can have surface
magnetic ﬁeld B ∼ 107 − 1010 G and rotate very fast with frequencies Ω ∼ 1 rad/s,
consistent with the observed rotation periods P ∼ (2 − 12) s.

1. Introduction

The Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars are a special class
of pulsars, they are understood in the framework of strongly magnetized neutron
star,1, 2 but there are alternative scenarios, in particular the white dwarf (WD)
pulsar model developed by Malheiro, Rueda and Ruﬃni.3 Recently, four over a
total of about 23 SGRs/AXPs presented radio-pulsed emission. These radio sources
showed several properties that make them diﬀerent from the others SGRs/AXPs.
As pointed by Coelho and Malheiro4 the large steady X-ray luminosity seen
for some no-radio SGRs/AXPs, can be explained as coming from a large spin-
down energy lost of a massive white dwarf with a much large magnetic dipole

moment of 1034 ≤ µ ≤ 1036 emu consistent with the range observed for isolated
and very magnetic WDs (see Coelho & Malheiro 20125 for discussions), indicating
a diﬀerent nature between these sources and the radio SGRs/AXPs. These radio
SGRs/AXPs have large magnetic ﬁeld and seem to be very similar to the high-
B pulsars recently founded.6 However, even if the radio SGRs/AXPs are strong
magnetized neutron stars, they are not magnetars in the sense that their steady
luminosity is not originated by the magnetic energy, but from the rotational energy
as rotation powered pulsars.

2. Canonical spin-powered pulsar model

Rotation powered pulsars (RPPs) are detected by its radio emission and their lu-
minosity LX is considered as coming from rotation.

In this model we consider a dipole moment µ with an orientation α in the
rotation axis that rotates with an angular frequency Ω. On the surface of the star
the magnetic ﬁeld at the equator is Bs ∼ µ/R3 and at the poles Bp = 2µ/R3, where
R is the star radius. The rotational energy is given by,7

Erot =

IΩ2,

(1)

where I is the moment of inertia. Thus, the loss of rotational energy of the pulsar
is:

˙Erot = IΩ ˙Ω +

˙IΩ2 ≈ IΩ ˙Ω.

Such conﬁguration has a time-varying magnetic dipole moment, in an inﬁnity ref-
erential, and radiates energy with a rate

where c is the speed of light. Combining (2) and (3) we obtain the surface magnetic
ﬁeld at the equator as:8

with period P = 2π/Ω, and ˙P = dP/dt. We see that the value of the magnetic ﬁeld
P ˙P that are measures obtained by astronomical observations,
is inferred from
and two parameters, the moment of inertia I and the star radius R that depend
how the mass-energy density is distributed inside the star, are obtained solving the
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ equation for a speciﬁc equation of state chosen, and
of course, are quite diﬀerent for Neutron Stars or White Dwarfs.

3. The magnetar model

In the magnetar model, the SGRs/AXPs are considered as neutron stars with large
magnetic ﬁelds, higher than the value of critical ﬁeld from the quantum electrody-
namics (QED) Bq ≡ m2c3/e = 4.4 × 1013 G (m is the electron’s mass, c the speed
of light and  the reduced Planck’s constant and e the charge) and 100-1000 times
than the magnetic ﬁeld of normal pulsars observed. The observed X-ray luminosity
LX is determined by complex structures in its magnetosphere (see1, 2), considering
that luminosity is powered by the energy of magnetic ﬁeld.

The recent discovery of radio-pulsed emission in four of this class of sources,
where the spin-down rotational energy lost ˙Erot is larger than the X-ray luminosity
LX as we see in the Figure (1) opens the question of the nature of these radio
sources in comparison to the other SGRs/AXPs (we have also recently studied this
point in Refs.,9–11 where the models of radio emission were investigated).

3.1. Diﬃculties with the magnetar model

According the magnetar model the high X-ray luminosity from this sources is pow-
ered by the energy stored in their strong magnetic ﬁelds.12, 13 Although the inter-
pretation as neutron stars is the one most successfully, here are some aspects about
SGRs/AXPs not very well understood in this interpretation:

• RPPs are assumed born with a short period ∼1ms resulting in large mag-
netic ﬁelds by dynamo process,14 the SGRs/AXPs presents longs period,
such that generation of high magnetic ﬁelds by this mechanisms is not well
understood.
• the large spin-down rates in comparison with the typical pulsar implies,
for example, that the source SGR 0418+5729 has a characteristic age τ =
P/2 ˙P = 2.4× 107 years. Thus, it is diﬃcult to understand, how being much
older than ordinary pulsars, it still ﬁts in the magnetar model where the
sources are seen as young pulsars.

In fact, some SGRs/AXPs with low magnetic ﬁelds and smaller spin-down rates
were observed.15 In this observation we highlight SGR 0418+5729, with period
P = 9.08s, spin-down ˙P < 6.0×10−15s/s and X-ray luminosity LX < 6.2×1031erg/s,
considering this source a neutron star, the loss of energy associated with injection
of rotational energy in the pulsars magnetosphere does not explain the luminosity
of this star, i.e.,
rot < LX. Thus, excludes the possibility to be a RPP, where
˙ENS
rot > LX. Recent observations of Fermi satellite16–18 does not ﬁnd evidences of
γ radiation. Furthermore, were detected 4 SGRs/AXPs that emit in wavelength
of radio, while for the others not. These observations carried some uncertainties
about the nature of SGRs/AXPs and opens the possibility of consider a diﬀerent
nature for these sources, as white dwarf pulsars as proposed by Malheiro, Rueda
and Ruﬃni.3

4. SGRs/AXPs as white dwarf pulsars
Rapidly, massive white dwarfs and with observed high magnetic ﬁeld 106 − 109G
were detected in the recent years19 and share some similarities with SGRs/AXPs.
After these facts, Malheiro and collaborators3 following two works from Morini20
and Paczynski21 developed an alternative model explaining SGRs/AXPs as white
dwarfs. As was investigated by Usov in 1989,22 the process of release energy in
a massive, magnetic white dwarf can be explained in terms of a canonical spin-
powered pulsars model, because in several aspects they are similar.
For example, if we consider a star with M = 1.4M(cid:12) and R = 106 cm (a neutron
star), from (4) the magnetic ﬁeld at poles is:

(5)
In the case of a white dwarf with M = 1.4M(cid:12) and R = 3 × 108 cm, there is a new
scale for the magnetic ﬁeld at poles:

p = 3.2 × 1019(P ˙P )1/2G,
BNS

p = 4.21 × 1014(P ˙P )1/2G,
BWD

(6)

and to the dipole moment µ , responsible by the dipole radiation emitted, which is
a factor 103 times larger than for neutron stars. That is the factor observed between
the X-Ray luminosity of SGRs/AXPs as white dwarfs and slowly pulsars like the
XDINS,23 and high magnetic pulsars:24 basically all these sources present the same
period P ∼ 1 − 10s that SGRs/AXPs. When SGRs/AXPs are white dwarfs there
are new values for the mass density, moment of inertia, dipole moment and rotation
energy. It explains a large class of problems related in considering SGRs/AXPs as
neutron stars. Furthermore, we cannot ignore the recent astronomical observations
of old SGRs (characteristic age ∼ (106 − 107) Myr) with low surface magnetic
ﬁeld, as well as the four SGRs/AXPs showing radio emission recently discussed by
Coelho and Malheiro.25, 26 In the table (1) we summarized the properties among
SGR 0418+5729, Swift J1822.3-160627 (both SGRs with low-B), AE Aquarii28 (the
ﬁrst white dwarf pulsar), RXJ 0648.0-4418 (rapid WD that emit in X-ray), and the
candidate EUVE J0317-855.29

• the existence of stable white dwarfs could explain the band of period 2 (cid:46)
P (cid:46) 12s observed in SGRs/AXPs. In particular the fact that we do not
observe SGRs/AXPs with P < 2s is due the white dwarf structure. In31 self-
consistent computations shown that the minimum period to white dwarfs
are ∼ 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 2.2s to star made of 4He, 12C, 16O, 56Fe respectively.
• the energy balance is solved, since the X-luminosity observed is less than the
rotational energy of a white dwarf, LX < ˙Erot, because ˙Erot is 105 bigger
than the value to a neutron star. SGRs/AXPs powered by rotational energy
are completely analogous to RPPs of neutron star.
• largest luminosity LX ∼ 1035erg/s to slowly pulsar (Ω ∼ 1Hz) is understood
as consequence of the white darfs’ radius that produces a large dipole mo-
ment. Some works shown the possibility of pulsed radiation in white dwarfs.
SGRs/AXPs like white dwarfs have large magnetic ﬁelds and rotate very
fast, near the Kepler frequency, and they could produce large potential dif-
ference on its surface able to produce X and γ radiation.32 Bursts in this
sources, that is common, would be a consequence of their angular veloc-
ity and change in the moment of inertia. In this situation there are blunt
changes in gravitational energy.3
• SGRs/AXPs has a low population in contrast with more than 2000 RPPs
founded, this is justiﬁed by the motivation that white dwarfs with high
magnetic ﬁeld an rapidly are rarely formed.33 Furthermore following the
observations, white dwarfs with high magnetic ﬁelds are only 10% of mag-
netic stars.

4.1. Eﬃciency

SGRs/AXPs when understood as neutron stars typically have a larger luminosity
in X-ray that can not be explained by their spin-down luminosity, i.e., LX (cid:29) ˙Erot.
However, in four of them that is not true and they present radio emission. These
radio SGRs/AXPs showed several properties diﬀerent from the others SGRs/AXPs.
As was discussed, in this four sources the X-ray eﬃciency ηX = LX/ ˙Erot seems to
be small comparing with SGRs/AXPs as white dwarfs.3, 26 However, when these
four sources are understood as neutron stars pulsars the eﬃciency is ηX ∼(0.2-0.1),
much larger than the values of ordinary pulsars where ηX ∼ (10−3 to 10−4), but
still smaller than one: for this reason Coelho and Malheiro26 suggested that these
four star are very eﬃcient neutron stars RPPs in contrast to the others that are
white dwarfs RPPs. As we can see in the ﬁgure (1) this four sources presents a
loss of rotational energy larger than the X-ray luminosity. They are very similar
to the high-B pulsars recently found34, 35 which have their luminosity powered by
rotational energy.

Fig. 1. Four SGRs/AXPs in comparison with all no-radio SGRs/AXPs as neutron stars. These
radio sources have large magnetic ﬁelds and are very similar to high-B pulsars. Even this sources
are strong magnetized neutron stars, they are not magnetar, because their steady luminosity can
be explained by loss of rotational energy.

4.2. Diﬃculties with the white dwarf pulsar model

Although SGRs/AXPs as white dwarfs pulsars are well described, there are some
diﬃculties aspects in the phenomenology:

• Some SGRs/AXPs are associate with supernova. Usually, this association is
an evidence of SGRs/AXPs to be neutron stars; and also some are associate
with new born stars’ clusters.
• AXPs show up variation in its luminosity and some transients seems to

contradict the rotation powered hypotheses.

SGRs/AXPs as white dwarfs pulsars in comparison with magnetar have larger ra-
dius. However is diﬃcult to estimate the radius due to the distance, since the ma-
jority of SGRs/AXPs are in d (cid:38) 2 kpc. The knowledge about their nature has an
uncertainty until we have better measures for the radii of these sources.

5. Conclusions

Some SGRs/AXPs within the description of white dwarfs pulsars can be well un-
derstood. In the white dwarfs pulsars scenario we solve the majority of problems
concerning the magnetar model, in particular the ultra high magnetic ﬁelds. Super-
massive, fast and highly magnetized white dwarfs have already been found and, this
number is increasing every year, opening a new research area. The future will solve
the correct nature of SGRs/AXPs: Magnetars or White Dwarf pulsars.
