Abstract
We conducted a high-sensitivity radio detection survey for forty narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1)
galaxies using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) at 22 GHz through phase-referencing
long-time integration and using a newly developing recorder with a data rate of 8 Gbps, which
is a candidate of the next generation VLBI data recording systems for the Japanese VLBI
Network. The baseline sensitivity was typically a few mJy. The observations resulted in a
detection rate of 12/40 for our radio-selected NLS1 sample; 11 out of the detected 12 NLS1s
showed inverted radio spectra between 1.4 and 22 GHz on the basis of the Very Large Array
ﬂux densities and the VLBI detections. These high fractions suggest that a compact radio
core with a high brightness temperature is frequently associated with NLS1 nuclei. On the
other hand, at least half of the sample indicated apparently steep spectra even with the limited
VLBI sensitivity. Both the inverted and steep spectrum radio sources are included in the NLS1
population.

1 Introduction

The radio natures of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1s) galaxies po-
tentially provide us key understandings of outﬂowing mecha-
nisms in the growing phase of active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
NLS1s as a class are thought to be fed at high mass accretion
rates onto relatively small-mass black holes, potentially con-
necting between stellar-mass and supermassive black hole sys-
tems in the mass function. The ﬁrst systematic studies in ra-

dio bands by interferometric observations were carried out at
arc-second resolutions using the Very Large Array (VLA), and
indicated little difference between NLS1s and Seyfert galaxies:
similar radio luminosities, steep radio spectra, and scarcely re-
solved radio morphology suggest the presence of weak nonther-
mal jets as a radio emitting source (Ulvestad et al. 1995; Moran
2000), although several optical/X-ray properties are clearly dif-
ferent. NLS1s were thought to be radio-quiet objects as a class

with only a few exceptions of known radio-loud objects (e.g.,
Grupe et al. 2000; Oshlack et al. 2001; Siebert et al. 1999);
subsequent systematic studies based on large database, such as
the VLA Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters
(FIRST; Becker et al. 1995) and the NRAO VLA Sky Survey
(NVSS; Condon et al. 1998) in radio and the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) in optical, have revealed a lower fraction of
radio-loud objects (∼ 7%; Komossa et al. 2006, see also Zhou
et al. 2006; Whalen et al. 2006; Yuan et al. 2008) compared to
that of broad-line Seyfert galaxies.

Recently, gamma-ray detections by Fermi Gamma-Ray
Space Telescope toward six NLS1s galaxies with high signif-
icance (Abdo et al. 2009a, 2009c; D’Ammando et al. 2012,
2015) have offered a new population of gamma-ray emitting
AGNs other than blazars and radio galaxies. The radio observa-
tions at high angular resolutions using very-long-baseline inter-
ferometry (VLBI) for the ﬁrst discovered γ-ray emitting NLS1
SDSS J094857.31+002225.4 (PMN J0948+0022) had revealed
the presences of a one-sided pc-scale jet and a rapidly variable,
very high brightness radio core showing an inverted spectrum
at the nucleus (Doi et al. 2006). PMN J0948+0022 also shows
a core-dominant structure with two-sided kpc-scale radio emis-
sions (Doi et al. 2012). The combination of these radio/gamma-
ray properties is reminiscent of blazars, which are characterized
by Doppler-beaming on relativistic jets viewed from pole-on
typically at parsec (pc) scales and by decelerated components
at from kpc to Mpc scales. VLBI observations of the other
several gamma-ray emitting NLS1s also indicate the presence
of beamed jets at pc scales (D’Ammando et al. 2012, 2013b;
Doi et al. 2011, 2013; Wajima et al. 2014); some of them also
show two-sided kpc-scale radio structures (Ant´on et al. 2008;
Doi et al. 2011, 2012). However, the radio jets are mildly rel-
ativistic and their powers are comparable to the least energetic
blazars, on the basis of single-dish monitoring (Angelakis et al.
2015).

On the other hand, VLBI observations of radio-loud NLS1s
including gamma-ray detections/non-detections have revealed
that the radio-loud aspect is possibly attributed not only to
a beaming effect but also an intrinsically large radio power.
Intrinsic radio powers that are corrected for the beaming ef-
fect using estimated Doppler factors suggest that radio-loud
NLS1s include both intrinsically radio-loud and intrinsically
radio-quiet cases (Doi et al. 2011, 2012). An extended pc-scale
jet showing a steep spectrum dominates a total radio power,
which suggests being not so relativistic and/or sufﬁciently in-
clined with respect to our line of sight for the jet (Gu & Chen
2010; Gu et al. 2015). Seven out of known ten NLS1s with kpc-
scale radio structures (Richards & Lister 2015, see also Gliozzi
et al. 2010; Doi et al. 2012, 2015) are not still gamma-ray de-
tected. This situation suggests that jet powers may be intrinsi-
cally large sufﬁcient to escape the core regions of host galaxies,

but not so beamed because of relatively large viewing angles.
For several nearby radio-quiet NLS1s, VLBI observations have
also revealed pc-scale jet-like structures showing steep spectra,
which are presumably generated through the same process as
that of radio-loud NLS1s, but probably with an only difference
in power or viewing angle for nonthermal jets (Giroletti et al.
2005; Doi et al. 2013, 2015). Thus, at least a fraction of NLS1
nuclei has an ability to generate nonthermal jets, which have a
wide range of radio powers; in some cases, the signatures of
beaming effect on relativistic jets viewed from pole-on are ob-
served.

However, a limited number of NLS1s has still been in-
vestigated at milli-arcsecond (mas) resolutions so far, because
NLS1s are relatively weak radio sources in comparison with
the other AGN classes. Systematic VLBI observations have
been started by the other authors (Gu et al. 2015), whose targets
are sixteen radio-loud NLS1s selected from several parent sam-
ples with 105 sources; fourteen sources were detected at 5 and
6.7 GHz, which were relatively low frequencies and may tend
to be biased to the contribution of an extended jet component.
The present paper reports the result of a new VLBI detection
survey as a systematic study for NLS1s in the radio band at a
higher frequency (22 GHz), where an inner jet component is
potentially focused on. Our observation was planned before the
publication of Gu et al. (2015). Our sample selection was rela-
tively similar to theirs; the differences are (1) the combination
of parent samples, (2) including radio-quiet NLS1s as well, and
(3) at a higher observing frequency. Section 2 presents the sam-
ple selection. In Sections 3 and 4, VLBI observations and the
procedures of data reductions are described. These results are
presented and its implications are brieﬂy discussed in Section 5.

2 Sample

We selected NLS1 radio sources by position-matching between
the catalog of the Very Large Array (VLA) 1.4-GHz Faint
Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm (FIRST) survey (Becker
et al. 1995) and source lists in the following NLS1 studies:
(1) 64 sources in V´eron-Cetty et al. (2001), (2) 2011 sources
in Zhou et al. (2006), (3) 23 sources in Yuan et al. (2008), and
(4) 62 sources in Whalen et al. (2006). We found several sources
that were counted redundantly; the number of uniquely selected
sources resulted in 233 sources (734–0.8 mJy beam−1). We
clipped these sources into 41 sources with an intensity higher
than 10 mJy beam−1. The NLS1 radio source catalogue that is
a target list in the present study is listed in Table 1.

The sample selection criteria are similar to those of the pre-
vious systematic VLBI study by Gu et al. (2015), which was
also based on the radio selected samples with ﬂux densities of
> 10 mJy in the FIRST. The parent samples were restricted
to only radio-loud objects from Komossa et al. (2006); Zhou

et al. (2006); Yuan et al. (2008); Foschini (2011), which were
slightly different from ours including radio-quiet ones as well.
Six radio-quiet objects are included in our sample (log RL < 1,
see Col. (7) in Table 1).

3 Observation

The observations are performed as a part of the experimen-
tal observations to test a developing OCTAVE-DAS (Data
Acquisition System, Oyama et al. 2012). It is a candidate of the
next generation data recording system for OCTAVE (Optically
Connected Array for VLBI Exploration, Kono et al. 2012),
JVN (Japanese VLBI Network, Fujisawa et al. submitted) and
other VLBI arrays.

OCTAVE-DAS consists of three key components. The ﬁrst
is a high speed analog-to-digital (A/D) converter at a sam-
pling rate of 8 gigabits per second (Gbps) of 3 bit quantiza-
tion. It is called OCTAD (OCTave A/D converter). It is able
to sample signals at a radio frequency (RF) directly. In addi-
tion, it has digital base-band converter (DBBC) functions for
the VLBI Global Observing System (VGOS) observation. The
second key component is a media converter between single
10 GigE (Gigabit Ethernet) port and four VSI-H (Vlbi Standard
Interface-Hardware) I/O ports. It is called OCTAVIA (OCTave
Vlbi Interface Adapter) or OCTAVIA2 depending on its ver-
sion. The last key component is a recorder. It is able to record
the data stream at the rate from 4.5 Gbps up to 32 Gbps.
It
is called OCTADISK (OCTave DISK recorder), OCTADISK2
or VSREC (Vlbi Software Recorder) depending on its version.
OCTAVE-DAS is being developed at the Mizusawa VLBI ob-
servatory, a branch of the National Astronomical Observatory
of Japan.

The test observations using OCTAVE-DAS were conducted
on April 21 and 28, 2014 using four radio telescopes of
the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry project (VERA;
Kobayashi et al. 2003); Mizusawa, Ogasawara, Iriki, and
Ishigaki stations participated in the experiment. The polariza-
tion is the left-circular-polarization. VERA has a dual-beam re-
ceiving system. The dual beams are called A- and B-beam. For
the dual beam observation in this paper, A-beam was used for
the target sources. B-beam was used for the reference sources.
The received radio signals of dual beams are converted to IF
frequency, respectively. The bandwidth is 512 MHz. The IF
signals are sampled by two A/D converters (ADS-1000s). The
sampling rate is 1.024 GHz. The quantization bit number is two.
The data streams are recorded by OCTADISK. The aggregated
bit rate is 4.096 Gbps.

In addition to this current VERA observation system, we in-
stalled OCTAVE-DAS in order to expand the bandwidth. We
also installed the analog signal converters with wider band-
width. The new system was installed on A-beam for this test

observation to increase the sensitivity of target sources. The
received signal of A-beam was divided to two signals for the
current and the new system. The signal for the new systems is
divided to four IF channels of which bandwidth is 512 MHz.
The starting frequencies of the four IFs are 21.459, 21.971,
22.483, and 22.995 GHz. The four IF signals are A/D con-
verted by ADS-3000+ which was developed by NICT (National
Institute of Information and Communications Technology) in-
stead of OCTAD for the observation in this paper. The sampled
data stream was recorded by VSREC. The aggregated recording
rate is 8.192 Gbps.

The dual beam systems with the current VERA system and
OCTAVE-DAS can work simultaneously. We utilized “dual-
beam phase referencing” in order to increase coherent inte-
gration time by elimination of the atmospheric phase ﬂuctu-
ation of the targets with the phases of the calibrators. For
several targets (SBS 0846+513, SDSS J103727.44+003635.5,
B3 1441+476, [HB89] 1519-065, [HB89] 1546+353), proper
calibrators cannot be found within a separation angle of 2.1 de-
grees. We used a nodding style phase-referencing. A-beam
pointing was switched between a target and a reference cal-
ibrator. On-source tracking was used for PMN J0948+0022,
which was expected to be detected without phase-referencing.
SDSS J124634.64+023809.0 was mis-allocated in our observa-
tion. The number of observed targets resulted in 40.

The A/D converter ADS1000 at Ishigaki station was un-
locked to a reference signal during both of the two observa-
tions unfortunately. The solutions of phase reference from the
B-beam were unavailable.

4 Data reduction

The correlations were processed with the software correla-
tor OCTACOR2 (OCTAve CORrelator), which was developed
at the Mizusawa VLBI observatory and NICT (Oyama et al.
2012). The correlated data were integrated every one second.
The frequency channel number per an IF channel is 512.

Data reduction procedures were performed using the
Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS; Greisen 2003).
Amplitude calibration using a priori gain values together with
the system noise temperatures measured during the observa-
tions were applied. The calibration accuracy had not been eval-
uated in this new system, probably less than 20%, which was
inferred from the comparison of results of known strong sources
in the data. The delay differences among the four IF channels
were calibrated using the fringe-ﬁtting solutions of a bright cal-
ibrator (”manual-pcal”). This solution allowed us to adopt a
small fringe-ﬁnding window in subsequent fringe ﬁtting proce-
dures.

For dual-beam phase-referencing, the fringe-ﬁtting solution
in phase for the reference calibrator was obtained with the B-

beam data at ﬁrst. Next, we applied the solution to the four
channels of the A-beam. Calibrators for ﬁve targets were not
detected. The difference between the center frequencies of two
beams is 256 MHz (∼ 1% with respect to the radio frequency).
In the case of residual phase variation of ∼ 100 deg (typi-
cally observed during VERA dual-beam observations) after a
fringe-rate removal, the coherence loss is expected to be only
0.02% when we apply fringe-phase solutions to data at a ∼ 1%-
different frequency. With the dual beam phase referencing,
we were able to extend the fringe-ﬁtting solution interval to
720 seconds. The interval is equivalent to a scan duration time
of the antenna schedule. As a result, six out of 29 targets were
detected at signal-to-noise ratios (SN Rs) higher than 3 in this
observing mode.

We also performed fringe-ﬁtting on the ﬁve target that ob-
served in the manner of nodding style phase-referencing with
a cycle of 40 seconds. The solution interval was 720 seconds
with a net accumulation of 240 seconds on a target. As a result,
two out of the ﬁve targets were detected at SN R > 3 in this
observing mode.

PMN J0948+0022, which was observed without phase-
referencing, was detected with a solution interval of 120 sec.
Fringe ﬁndings for ﬁve targets whose calibrators were not de-
tected in B-beam were also attempted with a solution interval
of 120 sec. As a result, three out of the ﬁve were detected at
SN R > 3.

5 Result and Discussion

Correlated ﬂux densities averaged through baselines with de-
tection are listed in the last column of Table 1; the table in-
cludes the references for sources for which previous VLBI stud-
ies exist. Upper limits of correlated ﬂux density, ranging from
7 mJy to 23 mJy depending on the observing mode (Sect. 4),
were determined by SN R = 3 on the most sensitive baseline
during observations. Twelve out of 40 observed targets were
detected with VERAs’ baselines ranging from ∼ 1000 km to
∼ 2300 km, which imply a brightness temperature of the or-
der of 107 Kelvin or more for high-frequency radio emissions
associated with these NLS1s. Even if we adopted a detection
limit of 5σ instead of 3σ, only [HB89] 1546+353, which is the
weakest detection in our sample, would get into non-detection.
and
the ﬁrst detected with very
FBQS J1713+3523, are for
long baselines. FBQS J114654.2+323652 was presumably de-
tected with the MIZUSAWA–IRIKI baseline in the dual-beam
phase reference mode; we also conﬁrmed the fringe detection
in a normal fringe ﬁtting, without a calibrator, with a shorter in-
tegration (2 min). Around this source, there is no strong source
potentially confusing to our observation. FBQS J1713+352
was positively detected with baselines of all the four antennas

in fringe ﬁtting without a calibrator (because its calibrator was
not detected in B-beam). Around this source, there is no strong
source potentially confusing to our observation. Both the
two sources are weak radio sources at 1.4 GHz in the FIRST
(15.42 mJy and 11.24 mJy for FBQS J114654.2+323652
(1994.4) and FBQS J1713+352 (1994.5), respectively); on
the other hand, they are relatively strong at 22 GHz in our
observation (104 mJy and 138 mJy). These sources should be
inverted spectrum sources with α = +0.7 and α = +0.9, where
α is the spectral index (Fν ∝ ν α), assuming that the 1.4 GHz
FIRST (and the 22 GHz) ﬂuxes do not vary signiﬁcantly in
∼ 20 years. Such a weak source showing an inverted spectrum
has also been previously reported by Doi et al. (2007) for
FBQS J1629+4007, which is also in the list of the present
study and has been detected (11.95 mJy at 1.4 GHz (1994.6)
and 145 mJy at 22 GHz).
In the ﬁrst place, relatively weak
radio emissions at 1.4 GHz and a limited baseline sensitivity
at 22 GHz were supposed to strongly bias VLBI detections
toward inverted spectrum sources.
In fact, all the detected
sources except for one (11/12) show ﬂat or inverted spectra
(α = −0.1–+0.9) between 1.4–22 GHz, if variability in the
time interval between measurements at 1.4 and 22 GHz is
assumed insigniﬁcant. Although this is a sort of artiﬁcial
effect, it is noteworthy that not so small fraction of NLS1 radio
sources (12/40) have been detected at such a high frequency
even with very long baselines.

On the other hand, at least half of the sources indicate appar-
ently steep spectra (α < −0.2) between 1.4 GHz and 22 GHz on
the basis of the FIRST ﬂux densities and the VLBI upper limits.
Both the inverted and steep spectrum radio sources are included
in the NLS1 population, as previously pointed out by several
authors (Doi et al. 2007; Gu & Chen 2010; Doi et al. 2011).
Particularly, [HB89] 1044+476 is the strongest radio source
(767.44 mJy at 1.4 GHz in the FIRST (1997.2)) in our sam-
ple but not detected with the VLBI at 22 GHz (< 7 mJy). Only
a weak radio emission (19.4 mJy) with a core-jet structure in the
east-west direction has been previously found in VLBI images
at 5 GHz while VLA images at 8.4 and 22 GHz show signif-
icantly large radio ﬂux densities; a bulk of total ﬂux must be
resolved out with very long baselines and originate in extended
components of a compact steep spectrum source (Gu et al.
2015). B3 1702+457 is in the similar situation (118.64 mJy
at FIRST 1.4 GHz (1997.2) and < 9 mJy at VLBI 22 GHz);
the previous VLBI studies revealed an extended radio struc-
ture with a steep spectrum for B3 1702+457 (Doi et al. 2007,
2011). Hence, our negative detections with a limited sensitivity
at 22 GHz are genuine even for these sources relatively strong
at 1.4 GHz.

Consequently, the systematic study by our VLBI detection
survey has revealed that NLS1s are one of AGN subclasses
that can possess compact radio components with high bright-

Col. (1) Source Name in NED; Col. (2) redshift; Col. (3) right ascension; Col. (4) declination; Col. (5) peak intensity in mJy beam−1 in VLA FIRST; Col. (6) parent sample;
Col. (7) radio loudness from reference listed in Col. (6), except for sources from V´eron-Cetty et al. (2001) that includes no value for radio loudness. Note that the deﬁnition of
radio loudness differs from reference to reference. We calculated radio loudness for sources in V´eron-Cetty et al. (2001) by the ratio of FIRST 1.4 GHz radio to SDSS g-band
PSF optical ﬂux densities, according to V´eron-Cetty et al. (2001). Sources denoted by †† represent the use of B-band magnitudes listed in V´eron-Cetty et al. (2001) because
their SDSS results are not available; Col. (8) reference of previous VLBI observation; Col. (9) observation mode in the present study. ”ND” and ”2B” represent nodding-style
and VERA’s dual-beam phase referencing, respectively. ”1B” represents an on-source observation with a single beam. SDSS J124634.64+023809.0 was mis-allocated in our
observation; Col. (10) phase-referencing calibrator used in the present study. Calibrators denoted by † represent non-detection in B-beam; Col. (11) correlated ﬂux density in
mJy measured in the present study.

ness temperatures (>
∼ 107 Kelvin) even at the high frequency
(22 GHz). These compact components show inverted spec-
tra in almost all the VLBI-detected cases, which account for
a signiﬁcant fraction in our radio-selected NLS1 sample. These
properties may be related to NLS1s’ blazer-like aspects such as
gamma-ray detections in several NLS1s in contrast to normal
broad-line Seyfert galaxies.

Exploration Agency (JAXA), and the National Institute of Information
and Communications Technology (NICT). The VERA is operated by
the Mizusawa VLBI observatory, a branch of the National Astronomical
Observatory of Japan. We used the US National Aeronautics and Space
Administration’s (NASA) Astrophysics Data System (ADS) abstract ser-
vice and NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), which is oper-
ated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). In addition, we used the
Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS) software developed at
the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), a facility of the US
