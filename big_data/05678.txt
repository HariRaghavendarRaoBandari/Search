Abstract

We study the backreaction of smeared and localised anti M2-branes placed at the
tip of the CGLP background. To this end we derive a Smarr relation for backreacted
antibranes at zero and ﬁnite temperature. For extremal antibranes we show that
if smeared they cannot have regular horizons, whereas localised M2-branes can
potentially be regular when polarised into M5-branes, in agreement with the probe
result of Klebanov and Pufu. We further discuss antibranes at ﬁnite temperature
and argue that localised antibrane solutions with regular horizons are not excluded.

Introduction

Breaking supersymmetry in a controlled manner remains one of the hard challenges in
constructing string theory vacua. A reliable mechanism would be welcome for many
applications in string theory. One way to make progress is to combine two objects
which are both individually supersymmetric, while their combination is not. In practice,
one changes a sign of a charge such that the BPS conditions of these two elements are
incompatible. Consider for example an M2-brane in ﬂat space whose 16 Killing spinors
obey

(1.1)
where the sign reﬂects the charge of the brane. Combining two M2-branes with opposite
charge results in incompatible BPS conditions and supersymmetry is broken. Such a
solution is however also unstable; the branes attract each other and will eventually
annihilate. The same game can be played by combining M2-branes with nontrivial ﬂux

Γ012 = ± ,

dG7 = QM2δ(M2) − 1
2

G4 ∧ G4 .

(1.2)

One then also breaks supersymmetry in much the same way as for two oppositely charged
M2-branes. Brane/ﬂux set-ups have already proved useful in string cosmology [1, 2], the
black hole microstate program [3,4] and dynamical supersymmetry breaking in holographic
ﬁeld theories [5–9]. Stability of such a background is however more complicated to analyse
since the decay generically occurs through the Myers eﬀect [10], with the M2-branes
polarising into M5-branes that then subsequently decay. The M2-branes are then eﬀectively
annihilated against ﬂux quanta in a process called brane/ﬂux annihilation [6].

A concrete set-up involves placing anti M2-branes in the resolved cone background of
Cvetič, Gibbons, Lü and Pope (CGLP) [11] analogous to a similar one found by Klebanov
and Strassler in type IIB supergravity [12]. This set-up was analysed using a probe brane
in [13] where it was found that the M2 would polarise to a spherical M5-brane which ﬁnds
a metastable state close to the original M2-brane location. Later, various approaches
used to study the backreaction of M2-branes on the geometry revealed a divergent energy
density for G4 which could not be attributed to the presence of M2-branes [14–18]. One
reasonable interpretation of the singularity is that because the M2s want to polarise to
an M5-brane they induce the observed singularity in G4. The singular ﬂux pile-up could
signal that the brane/ﬂux annihilation process occurs classically rather than through
quantum tunnelling [19–21]. If not, we would expect to be able to hide the singularity or
any polarised metastable state behind a horizon by heating up the branes [22]. Reference
[18] found that smeared antibranes exhibit a singular horizon at any temperature. A toy
model analysis of localised branes showed that the result of [18] might be an artifact of
the smearing [23]. In this paper we aim to determine what is required so that a extremal
polarised state exists, but we also revisit the non-extremal scenario.

Before discussing our results let us point out that the story outlined above closely
follows a similar one for anti D3-branes in the Klebanov-Strassler background [6]. These
also exhibit a singularity that could not be attributed to the presence of D3-branes [24–
29]. Many attempts to interpret the singularity have yielded negative results [21, 30–35].
Nevertheless, a recent discussion has showed some promise in resolving the puzzle that the
singularity raises. First, some have suggested that the singularity does not pose particular
problems when only one anti brane is placed in KS as opposed to many [36, 37]. Then it

2

was discovered recently that a possible loophole exists in previous arguments that allows
for a polarised state and a ﬁnite temperature version of it that resolves the singularity
[23, 38, 39].

In this paper, we study the backreaction of anti M2-branes and polarised M5-branes
in the background of [11], using a technique employed in [40] and further developed in
[34, 38]. After reviewing the essential ingredients of the CGLP background in Section 2,
we derive in Section 3 the Smarr relation for a system of M2 and M5-branes placed at
the tip of that geometry. It relates the energy measured far away from the branes to the
charge and surface gravity of the M2/M5 system

E =

+ ΦM2QM2 + ΦM5QM5 ,

(1.3)

where κ and A denote the surface gravity and area respectively, ΦM2 and QM2 denote the
potential and M2-charge of the system, while ΦM5 and QM5 denote the dipole potential
and charge of the brane system. Note that since the M5-branes are contractible, as we
explain later, their monopole charge vanishes. However, we ﬁnd similar to [38,41] that the
dipole charge of the M5s contribute with a non-vanishing term to the Smarr relation. A
non-vanishing dipole contribution is only possible for horizons with a non-trivial topology.1
In Section 4 we warm up by discussing smeared antibranes, which we will show cannot
be regular. Then, in Section 5, we extend the results of [14, 15, 18] to localised branes,
showing that extremal anti M2-branes with trivial horizon topology cannot have a regular
horizon. If the horizon topology is non-trivial on the other hand, then the Smarr relation
does not constrain the horizon to be singular. This is most likely the metastable state
found by Klebanov and Pufu [13] although a full solution remains to be found. Finally in
Section 6 we consider non-extremal branes. There we argue that localised branes posses
at least two possible phases, diﬀering in their horizon topology, which we brieﬂy discuss.
We conclude with Section 7.

2 Anti M2-branes in CGLP

In this section we review the smooth background of [11] which is a warped product of
R1,2 and a Stenzel manifold. We start with the construction of Stenzel spaces before
turning to the full supergravity ﬁeld conﬁguration.

Let us consider Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in Cn+1 with a conical singularity at the

origin:

Cn =(cid:8)z ∈ Cn+1 : zizi = 0(cid:9) .
B2n−1 =(cid:8)z ∈ Cn : zi ¯zi = 1(cid:9) .

(2.1)
For n ≥ 3, the base spaces of the cones are Sasaki-Einstein manifolds of dimension 2n − 1
and can be identiﬁed by intersecting Cn with the unit sphere in Cn+1:

(2.2)
For n = 3 the base space is B5 = T 1,1 whereas for n = 4 the base is B7 = V5,2. A
resolution of the conical singularity of (2.1) can be achieved by modifying the deﬁning

1One could wonder whether the backreacted solution has no horizon but is rather supported by a
topological contribution as in [42]. In this paper we will not explore this possibility as we assume a
presence of a horizon.

where  ∈ R. For n = 2 the hypersurface is the Eguchi-Hanson resolution of the A1
singularity [43] while n = 3 gives the well-known deformed conifold [44]. The explicit
metrics can be derived using a Kähler potential K which only depends on the variable

and satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation [45]

We will focus exclusively on n = 4 with c = 9/43 for which an explicit form of the
metric can be found in [13]. Since we do not require its explicit form in this paper we omit
writing it. From now on we will rescale our coordinates to absorb , then the coordinate
ρ ranges between 1 and ∞ and for large ρ the metric reduces to that of the cone (2.1).

Finally, for ρ = 1 the metric reduces to that of a 4-sphere with radius(cid:112)3/2.

2.1 The CGLP background
The supergravity background of [11] is a warped product of the metric (2.6) with n = 4
and ﬂat 3-dimensional spacetime:

ds2 = H

(2.7)

This metric solves the Einstein equation derived from the action of 11-dimensional

The constant c0 controls the asymptotic behaviour of the solution. We will consider both
c0 = 0 for which the metric is asymptotically AdS4 × V5,2, and c0 (cid:54)= 0 for which the
solution is asymptotically Ricci ﬂat, R1,2 × C4. For c0 (cid:54)= 0 we can rescale the coordinates
as well as m to absorb c0. Therefore we will only consider c0 = 1 in addition to c0 = 0.

2.2 Probe anti M2-branes
Anti M2-branes placed in the M-theory background just described experience a radial
force which pulls them towards the resolved tip of the cone. In [13] Klebanov and Pufu
performed a probe analysis to determine the behaviour of p anti M2-branes sitting at the
tip. In this section we review their results.

Locally, close to the tip, the metric (2.6) reduces to the metric on the 4-sphere

3 is the metric on the round three-sphere and ψ ∈ [0, π] is the azimuthal angle
where dΩ2
on the four-sphere. Without loss of generality, one may assume that the antibranes are
initially located at the North pole, with ψ = 0. The interaction between the branes
and the background ﬂux gives rise to a polarisation process through the Myers eﬀect.
Concretely, the anti M2-branes polarise into an M5-brane carrying ﬁnite M2 charge
wrapping a ﬁnite size S3 at a certain value of ψ.

The probe calculation follows closely the initial work of [6]. By evaluating the
Lagrangian of a probe M5-brane with p units of M2 charge, one obtains an eﬀective
potential as a function of the azimuthal angle and the ratio p/M, where M is the total
G4 ﬂux threading the four-sphere:2

M =

(2π(cid:96)p)3

G4 =

18π2m
(2π(cid:96)p)3 .

(2.16)

Depending on the value of p/M, this potential has either only one absolute minimum at
ψ = π, corresponding to the supersymmetric state where the M5-brane has p− M units of
M2-brane charge which preserves the same supersymmetry as the ﬂux background, or one
absolute minimum at ψ = π plus a local minimum at some value ψ = ψmin, corresponding
to a metastable polarised state.

The analysis of [13] was carried out after a dimensional reduction along one of the
coordinates of the anti M2-branes. We then have anti fundamental strings in type IIA

3 A Smarr relation for M2-branes

In this section we derive the Smarr relation (1.3) for p anti M2-branes in the CGLP
background with ﬂux number M. We will assume that p/M (cid:28) 1, in line with [13]. In
Sections 4, 5 and 6 we then use this formula to constrain both extremal and non-extremal
antibrane solutions. We ﬁnd that smeared and extremal pointlike anti M2-branes are not
consistent with the Smarr relation, whereas polarised and non-extremal states are. Our
approach is reminiscent of the one employed in [40] and later [34] for type II antibrane
systems. In Appendix D we derive the Smarr relation for such set-ups.

ically, far away from the tip of the cone, the solution should look like the CGLP solution
described above. In particular the M2 charge measured at inﬁnity is ﬁxed to the one for
a CGLP background for a given m. When the antibranes are introduced we adjust m so
that the charge remains the same. This will lead to a nonvanishing ADM mass measured
at inﬁnity as we will explain in Section 5. It is the aim of this section to obtain the Smarr
relation between the ADM energy density, area, charge and chemical potentials of the
antibrane system.

The full antibrane metric is assumed to take the form

11 = e2A(cid:16)−e2f dt2 + (dx1)2 + (dx2)2(cid:17)

ds2

+ d¯s2
8 ,

(3.1)

8 is a modiﬁcation of the metric on C4

where d¯s2
 which takes into account the backreaction
of the M2 branes on the ﬂux background. We omit writing an explicit warp factor in
front of the 8-dimensional metric but assume that asymptotically, for large ρ,

d¯s8 → H 1/3ds2
8 ,

(3.2)

8 is given in eq. (2.6). Note that we have introduced a metric function e2f
where ds2
that breaks the Lorentz symmetry of R1,2 to incorporate a possible non-extremal state.
The metric is general enough to describe either a stack of anti M2-branes or polarised
M5-branes carrying M2 charge.

In the following it will be useful to introduce notation for the gauge ﬁelds that is

adapted to the metric (3.1). We write

G4 = −e3A+f vol3 ∧ F1 + ˜F4 ,
G7 = e3A+f vol3 ∧ F4 + F7 ,

(3.3)
(3.4)
which implies F4 = (cid:63)8 ˜F4 and F7 = − (cid:63)8 F1. In this section (cid:63)8 refers to the Hodge operator
8. With these deﬁnitions the equations of motion in absence of source terms take
on d¯s2
the form

1
2

dF7 +

˜F4 ∧ ˜F4 = 0 ,
d(e3A+f F4) + e3A+f F1 ∧ ˜F4 = 0 ,
d(e3A+f F1) = 0 ,
d ˜F4 = 0 .

(3.5)

(3.6)
(3.7)
(3.8)

For pointlike M2-branes in the internal space, only eq. (3.5) receives a delta function
contribution on the right hand side. For M5-branes that wrap three internal dimensions
only eq.
(3.8) receives a contribution, unless the M5 carries M2 charge which then
disguises itself as a contribution to eq. (3.5). For large ρ, the asymptotic expansion of all
ﬁeld strengths and warp factor should equal the one for the CGLP background to leading
order. Beyond leading order, ﬁelds will generically diﬀer from their background values.
We therefore let

e2f → 1 ,

e2A → H

(3.9)

as ρ → ∞.

We will from now on assume that there are globally well-deﬁned gauge potentials for

7

F4 and F1, deﬁned by

e3A+f F1 = dC0

and

e3A+f F4 = dC3 − C0 ˜F4 .

potentials reduce to

(3.11)
and so these are globally deﬁned for the CGLP background. The presence of M2-branes or
their polarised state does not aﬀect the existence of C0 and C3 in line with the discussion
below eqs. (3.5-3.8). The gauge transformations that leave the ﬁeld strengths invariant

(3.12)

3.1 ADM energy
We now turn our attention to the ADM energy density of the anti M2-branes. We will
relate it to the potentials C0 and C3 evaluated at the horizon of the brane conﬁguration.
The general expression for the ADM energy density of a p-brane conﬁguration in D
dimensions is derived in Appendix A, which extends the results of [46] to spacetimes
which are not transverse asymptotically Ricci ﬂat. The result is

For the CGLP background the horizon area vanishes and the regularity of the background
ensures that the second integral also vanishes so that we end up with the expected result

ECGLP = 0 .

(3.31)

The equation (3.30) has non-trivial implications for the consistency of the supergravity
solutions describing anti M2-branes and polarised M5-branes at the tip of the cone. It
allows us to relate the UV behaviour of the solution, characterized by the ADM energy
measured at inﬁnity, to the IR structure of the horizon. In [34, 38] such a relation was
used to argue for a singular ﬂux at the horizon of localised anti D3-branes sitting at the
tip of the Klebanov-Strassler background as a result of demanding a non-vanishing ADM
energy. However, we will use (3.30) in a somewhat diﬀerent way: we will assume that
the solutions have regular horizons, and from there on investigate what it implies for the
ADM energy measured in the UV.

3.2 Charges and potentials
We now close the ADM discussion by interpreting the last term in (3.30). First of all,
from the equations of motion (3.5)-(3.8) we can write a local gauge potential for ˜F4:

˜F4 = dH3 ,

F7 = ˜F7 − 1
2

H3 ∧ ˜F4 ,

where ˜F7 is a closed 7-form. With this we can rewrite the horizon integral as

(cid:19)

(C3 − C0H3) ∧ ˜F4 + C0 ˜F7

(3.32)

(3.33)

4In our units the charge of a single M2-brane is µM2 = 2π/(2π(cid:96)p)3 and the unit charge of an M5-brane

is µM5 = 2π/(2π(cid:96)p)6.

10

The integral involving C0 and ˜F7 has the structure of the potential-charge (ΦM2QM2) term
that is standard in Smarr relations for black holes. Indeed, we will see that C0 is constant
at the horizon. Moreover, the integral of ˜F7 corresponds to the Page charge sourced by
the branes, and hence measures the localised M2 charge present in the geometry through

(cid:73)

(3.34)

(3.35)

(3.36)

We are left with

where ΦM2 equals to the gauge potential C0 evaluated at the horizon:

ΦM2 = C0|H .

As for the other term in the integral (3.33), we will now argue that the three form
(C3 − C0H3) restricted to the horizon is closed. The Einstein equation for 11-dimensional
supergravity takes the form

Rµν − 1

gµν|G4|2 = 0 ,

(3.37)

from which we derived eq. (3.17). At the Killing horizon of the timelike Killing vector ξ
we have5

|ξ|2 = 0

and ξµξνRµν = 0 .

(3.38)

Contracting the Einstein equation with ξ at the horizon yields

|ιξG4|2 = 0 .

(3.39)

Analogously we can write the Einstein equation in terms of the dual ﬁeld strength G7
and run the same argument to show that at the horizon

|ιξG7|2 = 0 .

Using the deﬁnitions (3.3) and (3.4), we can rewrite the previous equations as:

e−4A|e3A+f F1|2 = e−4A|dC0|2 = 0 ,
e−4A|e3A+f F4|2 = e−4A|dC3 − C0 ˜F4|2 = 0 .

(3.40)

(3.41)
(3.42)

It follows that C0 is constant along the horizon as stated before and furthermore that
C3 − C0H3 restricted to the horizon is closed. The latter allows us to write

C3 − C0H3 = ω3 + exact ,

(3.43)

where ω3 is harmonic at the horizon. Furthermore since d ˜F4 = 0, the integral of
(C3 − C0H3) ∧ ˜F4 reduces to

(cid:73)

(3.45)

where M4 is a submanifold of the horizon which is related to the Poincaré dual of ω3 by a

system of anti M2-branes normalised for the background energy of the CGLP background:

E =

+ ΦM2QM2 + ΦM5QM5 .

(3.46)

The numerical factor 7/6 seems rather ad-hoc in this equation but is correct. We can see
this by deriving the ﬁrst law of black hole thermodynamics. It is easy to verify that κ
scales with the area in a non-trivial way

[κ] = L

−1 = [A]−1/7 ,

(3.47)

whereas the chemical potentials do not scale with the charge. Using this, the ﬁrst law
takes the expected form

dE =

(3.48)

3.3 Relation to on-shell brane actions
In [40] a similar relation between brane charges and the cosmological constant of a
compactiﬁcation of type II supergravity was obtained. There the derivation relied on
using delta functions in the equations of motion, which result from varying the brane
worldvolume action. This is only relevant for extremal branes for which the worldvolume
actions are known. We can also do this in 11-dimensional supergravity where the modiﬁed
form equations of motion take the form

dF7 +

1
2

˜F4 ∧ ˜F4 = QM2δ8 − QM5F3 ∧ δ5 ,

(3.49)

d ˜F4 = −QM5δ5 .

(3.50)
In these equations F3 is the self-dual tensor ﬁeld living on the M5 brane. It is ﬁxed by
gauge invariance of the M5 action to be F3 = db2 + A3 with b2 a 2-form and A3 the gauge
potential for G4. The Einstein equation will also receive delta function contributions
from the DBI actions of the branes but since we only use its external components in the
derivation of the ADM energy, we only need to consider the couplings to form ﬁelds.

We can now repeat the evaluation of the ADM energy using delta functions in the
equations of motion, following closely the calculation performed in the last two subsections.
All equations remain unchanged up to (3.26), which now takes the form:

(cid:16)

2|F7|2 + | ˜F4|2(cid:17)

e3A+f (cid:63)8

= d(C3 ∧ ˜F4 + 2C0F7)

−(C3 − 2F3C0) ∧ QM5δ5 − 2C0QM2δ8 ,

(3.51)

where b2 is assumed to only have legs transverse to the M2 worldvolume. The ﬁrst term
of equation (3.22) is zero since we only discuss extremal branes, the second one reduces

12

to an integral over the delta functions after cancelling the inﬁnite contribution using the
third term:

C0δ8 +

QM5

2

(C3 − 2F3C0) ∧ δ5 .

(3.52)

(cid:90)

E = QM2

(cid:90)

Note that we have assumed that the delta functions take care of the singularities and
that the total derivative in (3.51) is free of any singularities. Identifying the chemical
potential ΦM2 with C0 and ΦM5 with the integral

(cid:90)

ΦM5 =

1
2

(C3 − 2F3C0) ∧ δ5 ,

(3.53)

we reproduce the Smarr relation (3.46). It is interesting to note that the Smarr relation
has the form of a sum of on-shell brane actions in analogy with the results of [40]. A
recent paper has suggested that this is not an accident and in general the on-shell actions
of branes will arise in the calculation of the on-shell gravitational action (or free energy)
of a given system [48].

4 Smeared anti M2-branes

As a warm-up we will start by considering smeared antibranes. Smeared branes preserve
the full SO(5) symmetry of the 4-sphere at the tip of the background. This implies that
the gauge potential C3 vanishes. Regularity of the horizon then implies that

ΦM2 = C0|H = 0 ,

(4.1)

as follows from eq. (3.42). Finally, it easy to verify that a Smarr relation for smeared
branes cannot have a dipole contribution. This follows from eq. (3.44) together with the
previous result that C3 = C0 = 0. The ﬁnal Smarr relation for smeared branes then takes
the form

E =

κA
8πGN

7
6

.

(4.2)

Such a Smarr relation cannot be attributed to branes with antibrane charge. In particular
an extremal limit would give zero energy to the Smarr relation which cannot represent a
stack of supersymmetry breaking antibranes sitting at the tip of the geometry.

This result has previously been observed as singular backreaction of the antibranes
on the ﬂux background [14, 15, 18]. Our calculation does not allow for such a singularity
since we assumed a regular horizon. If we would not have done so, then we could not
conclude that ΦM2 vanishes, but we would then also see that the solution exhibits the
previously found singularity.

5 Extremal anti M2-branes

In this section we use eq. (3.46) to constrain localised extremal antibrane solutions.
Extremality implies that (3.46) reduces to

E = ΦM2QM2 + ΦM5QM5 .

(5.1)

All quantities on the right hand side of (5.1) are evaluated in the limit of zero horizon
area. For the set-up in question, the ADM energy measured at the UV is proportional to

13

E = 2pTM2e3A/2 .

two times the red-shifted tension of the p anti M2-branes sitting at the tip of the throat
[13],

(5.2)
Here e3A is the red-shift factor generated by the warping of the background evaluated at
the tip. This equation can be understood as follows. We ﬁx the M2-charge at inﬁnity
to be the same as for a CGLP background with a given m. This charge is calculated in
Appendix C and appears in equation (C.5). For every anti M2-brane introduced into the
background, m must be adjusted so that the charge remains constant. This is equivalent
to adding an M2-brane together with every anti M2-brane at the tip of the geometry
which explains the factor of 2 in eq. (5.2).

There is the further constraint from eq. (3.42) that restricted to the horizon,

dC3 = C0 ˜F4 .

(5.3)

We now focus on the component of this equation along the 4-sphere at the tip. ˜F4 must
be proportional to the volume form on the 4-sphere at the tip, since its integral there is
proportional to M. The symmetries of the solution require that the only component of
C3 along the 4-sphere takes the form

f (ρ, ψ)volS3

(5.4)

for a function f of the cone coordinate ρ and the azimuthal angle ψ on the 4-sphere with
the antibranes sitting at ψ = 0. Since C3 is globally deﬁned by construction, we conclude
that f (ρ, ψ) should reach either a minimum or a maximum at the poles, and therefore
dC3 restricted to ψ = 0 at the tip vanishes. Then eq. (5.3) yields:

C0|H = ΦM2 = 0

(5.5)

for pointlike antibranes. The conclusion is that the ﬁrst term in the right-hand side of
(5.1) cannot contribute and the Smarr relation reduces to

E = ΦM5QM5 .

(5.6)

Moreover, it is simple to see that for a pointlike horizon, just like for a smeared one, the
M5-charge QM5 as deﬁned in (3.45) is zero. This can be seen by freely transforming the
integration domain in the deﬁnition of QM5 in (3.45) to inﬁnity using the fact that ˜F4 is
closed. Since we demand CGLP asymptotics, and therefore no M5 charge as measured at
inﬁnity, we obtain

(5.7)
We conclude that there is no way to satisfy the Smarr relation (5.1) for pointlike anti
M2-branes present at the tip.

QM5 = 0 .

A crucial step in our argument above was that ˜F4 was regular at the horizon and that
we could freely transform the integral of ˜F4 to inﬁnity where it is zero, thereby leading
to a contradiction. Once the antibranes polarise to spherical M5 branes with induced
anti M2-charge both of these arguments break down. First of all we do expect a singular
˜F4 close to an M5-brane to account for the charge. Secondly, since the topology of the
polarised state is non-trivial one cannot freely transform the integral of ˜F4 to inﬁnity.
In fact, there will be obstructions whenever the integration surface M4 is non-trivial

14

in homology on the horizon (see ﬁgure 2). Note that for M5-branes the horizon is not
7-dimensional as for M2-branes, so three of the directions in the integral

(cid:73)

(C3 − C0H3) ∧ ˜F4 ,

(5.8)

H

are parallel to the brane worldvolume.
It is for this reason that we clarify that the
integration surface in eq. (3.45) must be non-trivial as for example in ﬁgure 2 in order
to give a non-vanishing contribution. The polarised antibranes have much in common
with black ring solutions in ﬁve dimensions [41] whose thermodynamics was studied in
[49]. The black rings had the surprising feature that the dipole charge entered into the
ﬁrst law. This was understood as a consequence of the horizon not being spherical as was
previously assumed in the black hole thermodynamics literature. If QM5, which we will
denote as the dipole charge, is non-vanishing we can obviously satisfy eq. (5.1).

In the set-up we are considering, we expect the M5-branes to source a component of
C3 extending along the three-sphere they are wrapping. In fact there is a very natural way
of satisfying the Smarr relation by letting again C0|H = dC3|H = 0 and C3 = f (ψ)volS3,
so that the gauge potential C3 equals the volume from on the brane times a function
f (ψ). Then the potential ΦM5 is proportional to f (ψH ), the function f (ψ) evaluated at
the polarisation radius. The Smarr relation (5.1) reduces to

2pTM2e3A = E = ΦM5QM5 = µM5f (ψH ) .

(5.9)

Where we used that QM5 is the charge of a single M5-brane, µM5. Comparing to the
probe result (2.20) we can rewrite this as

(5.10)
We learn that in order to recover the probe result in the p/M → 0 limit of the backreacted

solution, the function f (ψH ) should scale as ψ2

Figure 2: The left ﬁgure depicts a black M2 horizon for which the dipole charge vanishes. Since
˜F4 is regular and closed, the integration surface M4 can be shrunk down to zero size which
implies that QM5 = 0. In contrast the fact that polarised antibranes have a nontrivial horizon
implies that the dipole charge can be non-zero.

M46 Black branes

After having discussed extremal antibranes, let us take a look at what would be the eﬀect
of heating up the system away from extremality. The Smarr relation (3.46) now also
includes non-zero contributions from the area,

Remember that

= T S ,

(6.1)

(6.2)

where T is the temperature and S is the entropy of the black brane. Starting from the
extremal state discussed in last section we expect a near-extremal antibrane to have a non-
trivial horizon topology. This corresponds to a black M5-brane wrapping a contractible
three-cycle on the four-sphere at the tip of the cone. The dipole M5-charge does not
vanish (see ﬁgure 2) if the topology is non-trivial and ΦM2 can be small, or zero as in
last section. As the horizon area increases we expect an instability towards a collapse to
a spherical black brane which cannot support a dipole charge (see ﬁgure 2). A regular
horizon then demands a cancellation between the form ﬁelds

dC3 − C0 ˜F4 = 0 ,

(6.3)

when restricted to the horizon. This spherical phase, however, does not have a regular
extremal limit and so we expect that below some critical area Acrit the dominant phase
has non-trivial topology. In ﬁgure 3 we sketch these two phases as horizons in the ρ − ψ
plane close to the tip.

Let us remark that the spherical phase of anti M2-branes (as well as anti D3-branes)
was studied in a linear approximation in [23], where the branes were inserted in a toy
model background which captures some of the features of the set-up studied here. There
it was observed that the spherical antibranes become singular as the area shrinks to zero
size which is consistent with our results

Figure 3: The left ﬁgure represents a spherical black M2 horizon for which QM5 vanishes. The
right ﬁgure depicts a non-extremal M5-brane with induced antibrane charge. For small horizon
area we expect the latter to be the dominant phase.

ψρbψρb7 Conclusion

In this paper we derived the Smarr relation for anti M2-branes (and their polarised state)
immersed in the CGLP background [11]. We followed a similar procedure as in [34, 40]
where the supergravity equations of motion were combined to ﬁnd a constraint on the
boundary conditions of the solutions at the antibrane location. We showed that these
constraints arise when trying to satisfy the Smarr relation (1.3). We argued that smeared
antibranes do not satisfy the Smarr relation without a singular horizon in agreement with
[14, 15, 18]. We extended these results to localised extremal anti M2-branes in the CGLP
background, and showed that these also cannot be regular while satisfying the Smarr
relation. The relation can however be satisﬁed for an extremal polarised antibrane, i.e.
an M5-brane with induced antibrane charge. A crucial feature of the polarised brane is
that the dipole M5-charge is nonzero. We do therefore not ﬁnd a contradiction with the
probe results of Klebanov and Pufu [13]. Let us stress that moving away from smeared
branes and discussing fully localised branes was crucial to reach this conclusion. Finally,
by combining the probe results with ours, we give boundary values for the form ﬁelds
that could serve as starting points for numerical study of the full supergravity solution.
We brieﬂy discussed non-extremal antibranes where we expect at least two phases
diﬀering in their horizon topology. We argued that an antibrane with trivial horizon area
is unstable towards a black ring-like state for a small horizon area. We leave a closer
study of the diﬀerent phases of antibranes in ﬂux backgrounds and their instabilities to
future research. The technology used in this paper could also be employed to study black
hole microstate backgrounds that make use of antibranes as their method of breaking
supersymmetry. The antibrane charge is carried by a non-supersymmetric supertube that
polarises and carries dipole charge. It would certainly be interesting to analyse whether
conditions posed by the Smarr relation can be used to evaluate the accuracy of probe
calculations for supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric supertubes.

A ADM energy for p-branes in general backgrounds

In this appendix we extend the Komar integrals for asymptotically ﬂat black branes of
[46] to black branes with arbitrary asymptotics.

We will follow the Noether procedure as presented for instance in [50]. This method
leads to Komar-like integrals and is closely related to the approach of [51], which one
can use to calculate the energy of a p-brane in D dimensions with an asymptotically
ﬂat transverse space [46]. The main ideas of [46] generalize to non-asymptotically ﬂat
p-branes in a natural way, by adding a counter-term to the action that takes care of the
inﬁnite contribution of the background.

17

First of all, we consider the solution obtained by dimensionally reducing along the p
spatial dimensions of the brane. The reason for doing this is the fact that Komar surface
integrals are uniquely deﬁned for p = 0 (up to a normalisation factor) as opposed to
p ≥ 1, as explained in [46]. To this end, we write the metric as a warped product

ds2

D = gIJ (x)dxIdxJ + v(x)gmn(y)dymdyn ,

(A.1)
with I, J = 0, p + 1, p + 2, . . . , D − 1 and m, n = 1, 2, . . . , p. We will assume that the
solution is maximally symmetric along the p spatial directions of the brane.

Our solution is here just a point-like black hole, for which we can use the Noether approach
in order to compute its mass as explained in [50]. To do this, we need to ﬁnd a one-form
ζ such that the combination (d˜η + ζ ∧ ˜η) vanishes asymptotically, and is identically zero
for the background metric. Here, ˜η is the timelike Killing vector of the tilde metric. To
ﬁnd this ζ, we can can evaluate ˜η for the background:

˜η = ˜g00dt = e
2(D − 2)
D − p − 2

d˜η =

2(D−2)
D−p−2 ABdt
dAB ∧ ˜η ,

where e2AB is the warp factor of the background solution. This implies that

ζ = − 2(D − 2)

where µ, ν = 1, . . . , p and i, j = p + 2, . . . , D − 1. The factor e2f vanishes at the horizon,
while the component ˜g00 is regular.

C M2 charge of the CGLP background

The total M2 charge of the background as measured at the UV can be computed by
integrating G7 along the base of the cone for large values of the radial coordinate ρ.

D ADM energy for D-branes

In this appendix we present a general derivation of the ADM energy for Dp-branes
immersed in ﬂux backgrounds of type II supergravity with p + 1-dimensional maximally
symmetric spacetime. We assume a background three-form ﬂux H and (6 − p)-form ﬂux
F6−p which are internal and support a smooth asymptotically Ricci ﬂat metric. We also
allow for a ﬂuctuating internal (8 − p)-form F8−p. Asymptotically AdS metrics can be
treated in a similar way as was done in the main text.

Once the Dp-brane is introduced into the game, we expect a backreaction onto the
metric and the form ﬁelds. The metric splits into the worldvolume metric and a transverse
part

ds2 = e2A(cid:16)−e2f dt2 + dx2

(cid:17)

(D.1)

where t and xp span the worldvolume coordinates of the antibrane.

The trace reversed Einstein equation (in Einstein frame) along the brane worldvolume

is

(D.2)

The form ﬁeld equations can be written in terms of the magnetic dual forms

(D.3)
(D.4)
(D.5)
where η = (−1)p and the operator σ reverses all form indices. The forms in these equations
are related to the ones in the Einstein equation by the usual duality rules

dFp+2 = 0 ,
dFp+4 − H ∧ Fp+2 = 0 ,
dH7 + ηF6−p ∧ σ(Fp+2) = 0 ,

H7 = e−φ (cid:63)10 H , Fp+2 = e

p−3
2 φ (cid:63)10 σ(F8−p) , Fp+4 = e

p−1
2 φ (cid:63)10 σ(F6−p) .

(D.6)

Using the form equations above we write a set of globally deﬁned gauge potentials:

Fp+2 = −η σ(volp+1) ∧ dA0 ,
Fp+4 = −η σ(volp+1) ∧ [dA2 + HA0] ,
H7 = η volp+1 ∧ [dA5−p − ηF6+pA0] .

(D.7)
(D.8)
(D.9)

The existence of these potentials is not aﬀected by the presence of the anti-Dp brane or

21

its polarised states. We can now rewrite the right hand side of the Einstein equation as

(cid:16)

2e−φ|H|2 + (7 − p)e(p−3)φ/2|F8−p|2 + (5 − p)e(p−1)φ/2|F6−p|2(cid:17)

(cid:63)10 1
= −volp+1 ∧ d (−2A5−p ∧ H − (7 − p)A0 F8−p − (5 − p)A2 ∧ F6−p) .

(D.10)

Since we want to end up with a ADM energy density we redeﬁne the potentials we work
with. Finally using the form of the metric the worldvolume Einstein equations can now
be written as two PDEs

(cid:17)
(cid:16)
e(p+1)A+f (cid:63)9−p dA − B(cid:17)

At inﬁnity we expect that A5−p, A2 → 0 while the A0 → 1. The last term will therefore
give the Dp charge of the background, and we can normalise this away in the same way
as in the main text by including a counter-term in the action. Here we will simply drop
this ﬁnite term from the expression. The ﬁrst term in the integrand gives the surface
gravity times the area as explained in appendix B. This leaves us with

These can be used to rewrite B at the horizon
16B = −2(A5−p + A0B5−p)∧ H − (7− p)A0 ˜F8−p − (5− p)(A2 + A0B2)∧ F6−p , (D.17)
where

˜F8−p = F8−p − 5 − p

and is closed. The Einstein equations imply that on a regular horizon7

H7 , Fp+4 , Fp+2 → 0

(D.18)

(D.19)

7Here we make use of the fact that the D-branes in question are at ﬁnite temperature, which regularises

their horizon. All extremal D-branes have singular horizon except for the D3-brane.

22

which implies that the forms

A0 , A5−p + A0B5−p , A2 + A0B2

(D.20)

are closed when restricted to the horizon. This implies that on the horizon we can write

A5−p + A0B5−p = ω5−p + exact , A2 + A0B2 = ω2 + exact ,

(D.21)

where ω5−p and ω2 are harmonic. Repeating the same arguments as in the main text, i.e.
identifying the Poincaré duals of the harmonic forms and deﬁning the chemical potentials
as their proportionality factors, we are left with

E =

7 − p

(D.22)

All the terms in this expression are analogous to the ones we discussed in the main text.
QDp is the Page charge, deﬁned as the integral of ˜F8−p over the horizon.
