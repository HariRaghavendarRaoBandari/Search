Well–deﬁned criteria are proposed for assessing the accuracy of quantum master equations whose memory
functions are approximated by Pad´e resummation of the ﬁrst two moments in the electronic coupling. These
criteria partition the parameter space into distinct levels of expected accuracy, ranging from quantitatively
accurate regimes to regions of parameter space where the approach is not expected to be applicable. Extensive
comparison of Pad´e–resummed master equations with numerically exact results in the context of the spin–
boson model demonstrate that the proposed criteria correctly demarcate the regions of parameter space where
the Pad´e approximation is reliable. The applicability analysis we present is not conﬁned to the speciﬁcs of the
Hamiltonian under consideration and should provide guidelines for other classes of resummation techniques.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The study of open quantum systems is among the
most active areas in condensed matter science.1 Under
the rubric of dissipative quantum dynamics falls topics
ranging from electron and energy transfer2–6 to singlet
ﬁssion dynamics in condensed media.7–11 The theoretical
treatment of the dynamics of open quantum systems is
challenging due to the large number of degrees of freedom
and energy scales in such problems. Numerically exact
approaches12–22 are generally limited to idealized models,
while approximate approaches23–27 are often limited by
issues of both accuracy and scalablility. Thus, the search
for methods that are reliable, general, and numerically ef-
ﬁcient continues at the forefront of theoretical chemistry
and physics.

Schemes based on projection operator techniques28
and generalized quantum master equations (GQMEs)
have been used both to design successful approximate
approaches and as a platform to develop numerically ex-
act methods.19,29–32 The projection operator technique
partitions the Hilbert space into system and bath sub-
spaces, leading to the derivation of GQME for the sys-
tem subspace which accounts for the bath’s dynamical
inﬂuence on the system via a memory kernel. Exact and
approximate techniques for the evaluation of the mem-
ory kernel have been developed that make use of pertur-
bation theories,1,33–36 resummation techniques,37–42 and
self–consistent expansions.43–46 Recent progress aﬀorded
by these methods has illustrated several advantages of
the GQME scheme. First, the memory kernel may decay
on a shorter timescale than the system dynamics under
study, so that approximate memory kernels may yield
more accurate dynamics than would be obtained by di-
rect simulation of the system dynamics using the same
level of approximation. Second, the GQME scheme is
general enough to treat realistic anharmonic baths40,44

and arbitrary system–bath coupling.44 Finally, the ﬂexi-
bility of diﬀerent projection operator formulations allows
for facile extension to more general situations, such as
nonequilibrium initial preparation,47,48 as well as more
complex correlation functions.49 However, despite these
notable results, it remains a diﬃcult task to accurately
calculate memory kernels in many regimes of general
quantum dissipative systems.

The Pad´e resummation approach approximates the
memory kernel as an inﬁnite resummation based on the
kernel’s second and fourth moments.37,50 At the expense
of fourth–order perturbation theory in the electronic cou-
pling, the Pad´e–resummed GQME is capable of produc-
ing an accuracy that exceeds that of simple perturbation
theory for the spin–boson model,41 and resummation of
higher order kernels provide quantitative corrections.51
Recently, however, it has been demonstrated that this
approach can lead to unphysical, divergent dynamics in
the strong electronic coupling regime,42 and the applica-
bility and accuracy of the Pad´e approximations through-
out the entire parameter space is still diﬃcult to evaluate.
The aim of the present work is to provide feasible esti-
mates of the applicability based on analysis of the Pad´e
approximation itself.

We propose well–deﬁned criteria in terms of the ker-
nel’s second and fourth moments that correspond to con-
ditions leading to “physically reasonable” results within
the Pad´e resummation scheme. To examine the proposed
criteria, we perform systematic benchmark comparisons
of Pad´e–resummation with numerically exact results for
a prototypical dissipative open quantum system, namely
the spin–boson model with a Debye spectral density. The
proposed criteria divide the parameter space into sub-
spaces associated with diﬀerent levels of accuracy, and
we conﬁrm that the systematic comparison of population
dynamics with exact results clearly demarcate when the
approach should provide quantitatively reliable results.

It should be noted that the proposed criteria are not
limited to the spin–boson model, but are generally ap-
plicable for estimating the accuracy of Pad´e–resummed
memory kernels for generic open quantum systems. In
addition, the present work may provide guidelines for the
applicability of other types of resummation techniques,
such as the Landau–Zener resummation.42

The outline of the paper is as follows. We present
in Sec. II a brief review of the nonequilibrium Pad´e–
resummed GQME approach to a generic open quantum
system. In Sec. III, we analyze the Pad´e resummation
and deﬁne the criteria for the validity of the approxima-
tion. We apply the proposed criteria to the spin–boson
model in Sec. IV and show the correspondence of the dif-
ferent regions of the applicability phase diagrams with
exactly computed population dynamics.
In Sec. V, we
conclude.

II. THE PAD´E RESUMMED GQME APPROACH

We consider an open quantum system whose Hamil-
tonian takes the form, ˆH = ˆHs + ˆHb + ˆV , where ˆHs
and ˆHb correspond to the system and bath Hamiltoni-
ans, respectively, and ˆV denotes the system–bath cou-
pling. We denote the quantum states of the system by
the kets |ji and the bath density operator by ˆρ.
It is
convenient to adopt the Liouville space notation37,38 for
the total density operator, ˆW ≡ |W ii, and deﬁne the
product hhA|Bii ≡ TrsTrb{A†B} where Trs and Trb are
partial traces over the states of the system and bath,
respectively. Time evolution of the density operator is
governed by the Liouville–von Neumann equation

d
dt

|W (t)ii = −iL|W (t)ii,

(1)

where the Liouville super–operator (the Liouvillian) is
deﬁned by L|W (t)ii = [ ˆH, ˆW (t)] and we set  = 1
throughout this paper. The reduced density matrix of the
system can be written as σjk(t) = Trb {|ki hj| W (t)} =
hhjk|W (t)ii where the Liouville state is given by |jkii =
|ji hk| ⊗ ˆ1 and ˆ1 is the unit operator for the bath. Then
we can denote the population dynamics as

Pj(t) = hhj|W (t)ii,

(2)

where the diagonal elements are expressed as |jjii → |jii
for simplicity.

We implement

the standard projection operator

Pj(t) = Ij(t) − X

(4)

where the memory kernel matrix is

Kjk(t) = hhj|PLe−iQLtQL|kρkii,

and the inhomogeneous terms are given by

Ij (t) = −ihhj|PLe−iQLtQ|W (0)ii,

(5)

(6)

with Q = 1 − P. The inhomogeneous terms result from
the fact that the initial condition for the total density
operator will generally satisfy Q|W (0)ii 6= 0. For cases
Q|W (0)ii = 0, Ij(t) = 0.
In the frequency domain,
Eq. (4) can be transformed from an integro–diﬀerential
equation into the algebraic form

spj(s) = pj(t = 0) + Ij (s) − X

k

Kjk(s)pk(s)

(7)

f (s) = ´ ∞

with the use of the one–side Laplace transformation,
0 e−stF (t)dt, where s is a complex number.
It should be noted that calculation of the memory kernel
matrix and the inhomogeneous terms is diﬃcult in part
because dynamical evolution involves a projected propa-
gator e−iQLt.

To approximate the projected propagator, one can
carry out a perturbation treatment with respect to a
perturbation ˆH ′ and an unperturbed Hamiltonian ˆH0 =
ˆH − ˆH ′. The Liouvillian can be decomposed as L =
L0 + L′ and Eq. (5) and (6) can be expanded in terms
of L′. As a result, the memory matrix and the inho-
mogeneous terms in frequency domain can be expressed
as a moment expansion Kjk(s) = P∞
jk (s) and
Ij(s) = P∞

(9)

where the unperturbed Green’s function is G0(s) =
(s + iL0)−1.
In practice, evaluating the (2n)-th order
moment requires a Laplace transformation for each time
variable in a (2n − 1)-time correlation function. Clearly,
the complexity of the terms in the moment expansion
grows quickly as the moment order increases.

The memory matrix and inhomogeneous terms may be
approximated by a Pad´e resummation using the second
and fourth moments in the frequency domain,

where |jρjii = |ji hj| ⊗ ˆρj and the bath density operator
ˆρj is taken to be in equilibrium in the electronic state

ing. We now focus precisely on this issue.

III. APPLICABILITY ANALYSIS AND CRITERIA

The accuracy of the Pad´e resummation is unknown
and depends on the analyticity of an unknown function
in the complex plane. Despite this fundamental diﬃculty,
we may estimate its validity via simple convergence prop-
erties and physical requirements of the memory kernels.
For simplicity below, the criteria are expressed in terms
of a single memory kernel element K(s), thereby sup-
pressing the indices associated with memory functions
and inhomogeneous terms.

The Pad´e resummation can be viewed as a complex
geometric series which is expected to yield well–behaved
results only within the disk of convergence of the Lau-
rent series that represents the expansion in the complex
plane. A necessary condition for such convergence is
kK (4)(s)/K (2)(s)k < 1, for all s ∈ C, where K (n)(s)
is the n-th order expression given in Eq. (8). Since the
inverse Laplace transformation is performed along the
imaginary axis s = iω, we restrict this condition to

(a)

kK (4)(iω)/K (2)(iω)k < 1 for real ω.

2πi ´C K(s)estds, where C is the vertical contour

The above condition is quite strict and may be re-
laxed by consideration of the physical requirements of
a generic memory kernel. Consider the Laplace inver-
sion via the contour integration of the Bromwich integral
K(t) = 1
in the complex plane chosen to include all singularities
of K(s) to the left of it.53,54 The asymptotic physical be-
havior of the memory kernel dictates that the poles of
the Pad´e–resummed approximation cannot have a non–
negative real part, otherwise the memory function would
not be guaranteed to decay to zero as t → ∞. We as-
sume that the distribution of poles changes continuously
and smoothly as the parameters of the model changes,
allowing us to focus on the imaginary axis s = iω and
monitor the behavior of K (4)(iω)/K (2)(iω). In particu-
lar, the equality Re[K (4)(iω∗)/K (2)(iω∗)] = 1 is a neces-
sary (albeit not suﬃcient) condition for the occurrence
of a pole on the imaginary axis at s = iω∗, which obviate
the asymptotic decay of the memory kernel in real–time.
We thus propose a second condition

(b)

Re[K (4)(iω)/K (2)(iω)] < 1 for real ω,

3

which, excepting random occurrences, maintains that all
poles are conﬁned to the left of the imaginary axis in the
complex plane and that the memory function is well be-
haved. Note that the ﬁrst criterion is stricter than the
second since it corresponds to the interior of a unit cir-
cle in the complex plane while the latter condition cor-
responds to the entire complex plane to the left of the
boundary at Re[z] = 1.

These criteria are indeed crude because they rely on
the the limited information of the ﬁrst two terms of an
inﬁnite expansion. We will employ these conditions be-
low as demarcation lines in parameter space to gauge the
reliability of the Pad´e approximation. As will be demon-
strated, the criteria provide robust if conservative guide-
lines for the domain of applicability for Pad´e–resummed
master equations.

IV. RESULTS FOR THE SPIN–BOSON MODEL

A. Pad´e–resummed GQME approach for the spin–boson
model

In this section, we examine the criteria suggested above
via investigation of the population dynamics in the spin–
boson model. The spin–boson model is an idealization of
an open quantum system which contains most of the im-
portant generic features of more complicated dissipative
quantum systems while oﬀering the advantage that nu-
merically exact algorithms exist for the calculation of its
dynamics over a wide range of parameter space.12,13,19,25
To produce benchmark results for the spin–boson model
in this work, we use the numerically exact hierarchical
equations of motion (HEOM) methodology in the Paral-
lel Hierarchy Integrator (PHI).21

We consider a two–level system with energy bias ǫ and

constant electronic coupling ∆

ˆHs =

ǫ

ˆσz + ∆ˆσx,

(12)

and ˆσz = |1i h1| − |2i h2| and ˆσx = |1i h2| + |2i h1|. The
two–level system is coupled to a bath consisting of an
inﬁnite set of harmonic oscillators

(13)

Here, the frequency of the α-th bath mode is ωα, while
ˆPα, ˆQα refer to the mass–weighted momenta and coor-
dinates of the α-th mode. The system–bath coupling is
taken to be of the form

ˆV = ˆσz X

α

cα ˆQα,

(14)

where cα is the coupling strength between the two–level
system and the α-th harmonic oscillator. The spectral

the dynamics of the system, and takes the form

(16)

which is Ohmic at low frequency with a Lorentzian cut-
oﬀ at high frequency. The Debye spectral density is
characterized by two parameters: the characteristic bath
frequency ωc, which represents the average timescale of
the bath response, and the reorganization energy λ =
Pα c2
α, which is a direct measure of the coupling
strength between the system and the bath. In electron–
transfer theory, the Debye spectral density is commonly
used for the description of a solvent environment with
Debye dielectric relaxation (i.e. exponential in time).

Throughout this work, we employ an initial density

operator for the bath of the form

ˆρ0 =

e−β ˆHb

Trb{e−β ˆHb}

,

(17)

where β = 1/kBT is the inverse temperature of the bath.
This initial condition corresponds to thermal equilibrium
in the reservoir in the absence of the system–bath cou-
pling and is the initial density operator of relevance for
the description of an impulsive Franck–Condon excita-
tion.

We implement a commonly used projection operator

of the form,37,38

inversion.54
this

the Pad´e–resummed
GQME approach has lead to population dynamics
in near perfect agreement with numerically exact
simulations.39,41 On the other hand, Van Voorhis and
coworkers have shown the breakdown of the Pad´e–
resummed GQME approach in the strong electronic cou-
pling region.42 Our goal in the following is to system-
atically delineate the regime of validity of the approach
based on the criteria of Sec III.

B. Parameter Space Diagrams

The model we study in this work can be parametrized
by ﬁve independent energy scales. We use the electronic
coupling ∆ as the unit of energy so that four dimension-
less parameters characterize the parameter space. These
are: the electronic bias ǫ/∆, the reorganization energy
λ/∆, the bath’s characteristic frequency ωc/∆, and the
thermal energy of the bath kBT /∆.

To systematically scan parameter space, we consider
variation in the scaled ωc–λ plane for diﬀerent scaled
temperature and bias cuts.
It is expected that, for a
given system–bath coupling λ, smaller values of ωc/∆
render the Pad´e approximation less accurate due to the
fact that the perturbation series is ordered by ∆. There-
fore, we deﬁne critical characteristic frequencies, ω(a)
(λ)
and ω(b)
c (λ), as the lower bound of scaled ωc to satisfy
the criteria (a) and (b) for all elements of the memory
kernels respectively. The boundaries ω(a)
c (λ)
are determined by the conditions that there exists a sin-
gle imaginary number iω∗ for which either

are employed with ˆHj = ±( ǫ
1 and − for 2). Note that with the use of the projec-
tor (18), factorized initial conditions with an uncorre-
lated bath (17) will necessitate the evolution of inho-
mogeneous terms (11) in the GQME. The second–order
moments of the memory kernels (K (2)
jk ) result in an ex-
pression equivalent to the noninteracting blip approxi-
mation (NIBA).31 We carry out the time integrations
of the memory kernels and the inhomogeneous terms by
the techniques outlined in Ref. 41 and the same Gaus-
sian quadrature subroutine (DCUTRI).55 The population
dynamics of the Pad´e–resummed GQME is calculated

Re[K (4)(iω∗)/K (2)(iω∗)] = 1,

is satisﬁed. The critical characteristic frequencies indi-
cate the boundaries of the proposed criteria that parti-
tion parameter space into three distinct regions of diﬀer-
ent levels of accuracy.

Because K(t) and I(t) have similar structure that
should decay to zero after a transient time and the Pad´e
approximation takes the same form for both K(s) and
I(s), we expect the proposed criteria also apply to the
inhomogeneous term.
In fact, Refs. 39–41 have shown
that the initial preparation of the bath, captured by the
inhomogeneous term, is crucial for obtaining the correct
dynamics. We only focus here on the memory kernel and
expect the inhomogeneous term have similar analytical
behaviors.

For illustrative purposes, we show a phase diagram for
an unbiased (ǫ = 0), high temperature (kBT = 2∆) sys-
tem in Fig. 1 and the corresponding population dynamics

5

achieve almost perfect agreement with the numer-
ically exact results. This regime covers the weak
electronic coupling (non–adiabatic) limit (ωc/∆ ≫
1), where the ∆–perturbation based methods works
well. We also ﬁnd that the Pad´e–resummed ap-
proach provides a signiﬁcant improvement over
NIBA in the large system–bath coupling regime,
as can be seen in the upper panels of Fig. 1 (b).

2. ω(b)

c

(semi–quantitatively accurate):

c < ωc < ω(a)
The population dynamics of the Pad´e approach
in this region are not quite as accurate as in the
“quantitatively accurate” regime, but the Pad´e–
resummed method still captures most of the impor-
tant features in a semi–quantitative manner, such
as the long–lived oscillations and dissipative relax-
ation. Since the electronic coupling is considered
to be intermediate, the NIBA results become worse
while the Pad´e results remain accurate.

3. ωc < ω(b)

c

(unreliable):

The discrepancies in the population dynamics be-
tween the Pad´e approach and the HEOM generally
become larger in this regime since the large elec-
tronic coupling (∆/ωc ≫ 1) renders the perturba-
tion theory in ∆ questionable. In this regime, the
Pad´e approach may lead to a shift of the oscilla-
tion frequency of the population (see panels labeled
by (λ, ωc)/∆ = (0.2, 0.4), (0.2, 0.2), (1.8, 0.2)), as
well as overly coherent behavior (see the panel la-
beled by (λ, ωc)/∆ = (1.0, 0.2)). Extreme cases in
the strong electronic coupling (adiabatic) limit may
cause the Pad´e resummation breakdown and result
in unphysical population dynamics.
Importantly,
the parameters of Fig. 1(d) of Ref. 42 lie in the
“unreliable” region (labeled by × in the phase di-
agram). In this case the Pad´e–resummed approach
yields unphysical population dynamics for the long
time behavior.56

C. Energetic bias dependence

The bias dependence of the parameter space phase di-
agram is shown in Fig. 2, as well as the corresponding
population dynamics. We ﬁnd that, as the energetic bias
grows, both critical frequencies increase in the low λ re-
gion. Furthermore, in the region when ωc < ω(b)
c , the
Pad´e approach may lead to incorrect steady state popula-
tion values (see the panels labeled (λ, ωc)/∆ = (0.2, 0.6)
for ǫ = ∆ and (λ, ωc)/∆ = (0.2, 0.2) for ǫ = 3∆) as well
as an unphysical “recoherence” behavior (namely the en-
velope of the population does not decay monotonically)
as illustrated in the panels (λ, ωc)/∆ = (1.0, 0.2) for all
biases. This eﬀect can be attributed to near singularities
in the approximate kernels when the Pad´e resummation

namics in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 4(b) of Ref. 42 show qual-
itatively similar discrepancies from exact calculations as
illustrated here.56 The parameters for these two cases
(labeled as (×) in Fig. 2) lie in the expected regions of
parameter space.

c

and ω(b)

We ﬁnd that ω(a)

c become insensitive to the
energetic bias in the limit λ ≫ ǫ. Since the reorganization
processes dominate the incoherent decay in this limit, the
ﬂuctuations induced by the energetic bias becomes less
important here. Hence, the boundaries of accuracy of the
Pad´e–resummed GQME approach do not change when
system–bath coupling becomes very large.

D. Temperature dependence

In general, the Pad´e–resummed GQME approach be-
comes less accurate for lower temperature baths. Fig. 3
shows that, as the temperature decreases, the critical

frequencies increase signiﬁcantly throughout the entire
range of reorganization energies. This may be explained
by the fact that the bath degrees of freedom progres-
sively populate lower frequency modes as temperature
decreases, rendering ∆ relatively larger with respect to
the participating low–frequency modes. However, the
Pad´e approach can still properly capture the dynami-
cal eﬀect of the bath and yield qualitatively reasonable
results in the semi–quantitatively accurate region.

In the regions of lower accuracy, the Pad´e approach
tends to overestimate the coherent oscillations.
In ad-
dition, the coherent oscillations are generally shifted to-
ward lower frequencies. In addition, we observe spurious
recoherence in the panel labeled (λ, ωc)/∆ = (1.0, 0.6) for
kBT = 0.2∆. Once again the most sever deviations from
exact calculation are found in the region ωc < ω(b)
c (λ) as
expected.

The value (λ, ωc)/∆ = (1.0, 0.3) of Fig. 3(c) of Ref. 42
is labeled (⊙) in panel (c) of Fig. 3. However, note that
the values of the energetic bias are diﬀerent in this com-
parison. As discussed above, we expect both critical fre-

the value of (λ, ωc)/∆. The symbol × in panel (c) refers to the parameters corresponding to Fig. 2(b) of Ref. 42. The symbol

quencies to increase in the low λ region as the value of
bias grows. Hence, we infer by this trend that the value
of (λ, ωc)/∆ in the biased case should lie in the region of
parameter space where the Pad´e approach is expected to
be unreliable.

V. CONCLUSIONS

ture signiﬁcant features of population dynamics within
this regime.57 When ωc < ω(b)
c (λ), the Pad´e–resummed
GQME is demonstrated to often exhibit spurious long–
time behavior, overestimate oscillations with shifted fre-
quencies, and display unphysical recoherence. Overall,
we ﬁnd that the accuracy of the Pad´e resummation is
relatively insensitive to the system bias and reorganiza-
tion energy, but becomes worse with decreasing bath fre-
quency and decreasing temperature.

c

(λ) and ω(b)

In this work we provide criteria to estimate the ac-
curacy and applicability of the nonequilibrium Pad´e–
resummed GQME approach to dissipative quantum dy-
namics. For the spin–boson model, the criteria yield crit-
ical frequencies ω(a)
c (λ) that partition the
parameter space into three distinct regions of expected
accuracy. One particularly signiﬁcant outcome of our
analysis is the fact that the diﬃcult intermediate cou-
pling regime, where all energy scales are comparable, falls
frequently into a region of parameter space where the
Pad´e approach is expected to be accurate, and indeed
we ﬁnd that the Pad´e–resummed GQME can still cap-

The criteria of accuracy we propose is crude for several
reasons. First, it is only based on the analytic properties
of the ﬁrst two moments of an inﬁnite expansion. Second,
even with regard to these moments, we merely search
for the boundaries in the complex plane where a single
pole may obviate physical properties required of generic
memory functions. In this sense, the boundaries of accu-
racy are conservative and we expect to see cases where
the Pad´e approach may still yield accurate results even
if ω(b)
(λ) and even occasionally when
ωc < ω(b)
c (λ) . Indeed, we do ﬁnd cases where exact cal-

culations demonstrate that the approximate results may
be more accurate than expected. However, overall we
ﬁnd that the trends predicted by the criteria of Sec. III
faithfully delineate the trends of accuracy of the Pad´e–
resummed generalized master equation approach.

The proposed criteria should be valid for Pad´e resum-
mations used to approximate the memory kernels pro-
duced by other types of projection operators, and our
applicability analysis may provide guidelines for assessing
the domain of validity of other resummation techniques.
In particular, one can construct applicability phase dia-
grams for other theories, such as the Landau–Zener re-
summation, leading to an increased understanding of the
domain of validity of complimentary approaches. This
line of investigation will be taken up in future work.

56Despite qualitatively similar behaviors, we notice that our results
near the parameters marked by × appear to be more accurate
than those of Ref. 42. One possible reason may be attributed to
numerical errors of the FFT–based Laplace inversion method of
Honig and Hirdes.58 Here, we employ a simple improved method
proposed by Yonemoto et al.54 In addition, we note that Ref. 42
assumes Ij(s) = 0 which may yield diﬀerent population dynamics
for short times..

57The criteria should be generally applicable in the larger reorga-
nization energy regime than we present here. In fact, the NIBA
approach is capable of producing quantitatively accurate results
in the “golden rule” regime where the reorganization energy is
suﬃciently larger than the diabatic coupling (λ ≫ ∆). In addi-
tion, Fig 1 (a) and (b) of Ref. 42 show that Pad´e GQME approach
does capture the dynamics well for large λ/∆. Therefore, we ex-
pect the asymptotic behavior of the Pad´e GQME approach to be
as good as or better than the NIBA approach in this regime.
