Abstract

We have studied the high energy gamma-rays produced in the reaction 19F(p,αγ)16O for incident proton
energies from 1.5 to 4.0 MeV over NaF/Ag and CaF2/Ag thin targets in two diﬀerent sets of data. Gamma-
rays were detected with a High Purity Ge detector with an angle of 130o with respect to the beam axis.
The cross-sections for the high energy gamma-rays of 6.129, 6.915 and 7.115 MeV have been measured for
the whole group between 5 and 7.2 MeV with accuracy better than 10%. A new energy range was covered
and more points are included in the cross-sections data base. Results are in agreement with previous
measurements in similar conditions.

1. Introduction

Particle-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE) is
a common technique used to detect and analyze
some light elements [1].
In particular, the anal-
ysis of monoenergetic photons from the reaction
19F(p,αγ)16O can oﬀer applications to the analy-
sis of ﬂuorine concentrations, for example, in dental
studies [2, 3]. Nevertheless, literature on this topic
is scarce and, in some cases, inconsistent [4].

The 19F(p,αγ)16O reaction has a Q-value of 8.11
MeV and proceeds via the 20Ne nucleus, whose α-
decay leads to the ﬁrst excited states of 16O. Three
of these excited states (1−, 2+ and 3−) de-excite to
the ground state (0+) emitting gamma rays with en-
ergies of 6.129, 6.915 and 7.115 MeV. Besides, the
ﬁfth excited of state 8.872 MeV can be also pop-
ulated and can de-excite to the 1− and 3− lower
states by the emission of 1.755 and 2.741 MeV
photons respectively. A simpliﬁed levels scheme of
16O illustrating how the reaction proceeds mainly

This paper deals with the measurement and anal-
ysis of gamma-ray yields and cross-section of the
reaction 19F(p,αγ)16O measured at a polar angle
of 130o, ranging the proton beam energy from 1.5
to 4.0 MeV. The ﬁnal cross-section is calculated for
the whole group of high energy gammas, from 5 to
7.2 MeV, and compared with other results from lit-
erature in similar conditions [5, 6, 7, 8]. The cross-
section values in the beam range of 1.5 and 3.0 MeV
are given for the ﬁrst time.

2. Experiment

The experimental work was carried out at the
IST-CTN Tandem accelerator in Lisbon [9], in two
separate stages.
In the ﬁrst stage, the measure-
ments were performed with a proton beam at en-
ergies from 2.1 to 4.0 MeV with an approximate 4
keV step. The proton beam reached the reaction
chamber with a 2mm diameter spot after collima-
tors with typical currents of about 100 nA. The
target consisted on a NaF thin ﬁlm of 36 µg/cm2
evaporated over a self-supporting Ag ﬁlm of 64

µg/cm2. During the second stage, a proton beam
energy range from 1.5 to 2.5 was covered in approx-
imate steps of 10 keV with the same accelerator
conditions. Thus, there is an overlap in the energy
range between both measurements. In the second
stage, the target consisted on a CaF2 thin ﬁlm of 64
µg/cm2 evaporated also over a self-supporting Ag
ﬁlm of 68 µg/cm2. Both targets were developed by
our group in the Nuclear Physics Center facilities
in Lisbon.

The gamma radiation was detected with an OR-
TEC High-Purity Germanium detector (HPGe) of
64mm × 62.6mm with resolution of 1.76 keV and in-
trinsic eﬃciency of 45% for the 1.33 MeV 60Co line.
It is placed at an angle of 130o and a distance of
55.5mm with respect to the interaction point. For
detecting charged particles, two Camberra Passi-
vated Implanted Planar Silicon (PIPS) detectors of
50mm2 each, eﬀective depth of 100 µm, and 12 keV
resolution for alphas of 5486 keV from 241Am, were
also operative inside the reaction chamber placed
at about 110o and 140o with respect to the target.
In the ﬁrst stage of measurements, each spectrum
was acquired to the same number of counts, while a
new current integrator was used in the second stage
which allowed to record each spectrum to the same
number of current collected in the reaction cham-
ber. This method made simpler the normalization
procedure for the second set of data.

A custom made current integrator was used for
the start/stop DAQ signal so that each spectrum
was recorded with the same collected current in the
reaction chamber.

3. Simulation

The reaction chamber’s HPGe detector setup was
simulated in Geant4 and data was analyzed with
ROOT, all together within an user-friendly frame-
work for nuclear reactions simulations called Ensar-
Root, based on the FairRoot framework [10]. The
detector geometry was designed to ﬁt all the man-
ufacturer’s speciﬁcations.

The corresponding spectra of the photons of in-
terest was simulated in the HPGe detector, with the
corresponding intrinsic resolution. The kinemat-
ics of the reaction was included as well, giving to
the emitted photons a Lorentz boost ranging from
β = 0 to β = 0.02, as they can be emitted with
the recoil nucleus either in rest or still moving, and
in any direction with respect to the beam axis. A
deep analysis of the three main transitions to the
ground state by means of simulation is under study
and will produce a diﬀerent publication.

The main contribution of the simulation to this
analysis is a much better estimation and under-
standing of the detector eﬃciency at higher ener-
gies. The detection eﬃciency was calculated for
a photon energy range between 4.5 and 7.5 MeV,
and compared with that extrapolated from mea-
surements with radioactive sources resulting in a
good agreement. Although our region of interest
falls in the tail of the eﬃciency curve [11], that value
over the region is far to be constant. Furthermore,
a diﬀerence of 20% is observed between both ends
of the range. By assuming a constant eﬃciency like
the average value, as it is done in [6], the ﬁnal emis-
sion yield of a given photopeak, and therefore the
cross-section, can be underestimated by a factor up
to 5%. In this work, a parameterization of the de-
tector eﬃciency as a function of the photon energy
(in the range of interest), εγ(Eγ), was used for the
cross section calculation.

(dashed blue line). Gamma peaks of 6.129, 6.915 and 7.115

double escape peaks.

1845 keV is shown (solid black line). Also, the sim-
ulated spectrum (dashed blue line) obtained tak-
ing into account the contribution of each peak at
the given energy is shown. The three main peaks
are identiﬁed together with their single and dou-
ble escape peaks. It is known that the contribution
of each peak changes as the proton beam energy
changes [5] but, as already mentioned above, that
feature is being analyzed in detail by means of sim-
ulation and will be part of a future work.

The diﬀerential cross-section for the high energy
gamma-rays of 6.129, 6.915 and 7.115 MeV was ob-
tained for the whole group, within a window be-
tween 5 and 7.2 MeV in the energy spectrum of
gammas. The measured values were deduced from

In the overlapped region of the two sets of data
(proton beam energy between 2.1 and 2.5 MeV),
only points from the second stage was taken into
account due to the fact that data from the ﬁrst
stage presented technical problems in part of that
range. The measured diﬀerential cross-sections for
the whole group are presented in Fig. 3. The con-
tributions to the error bars come from statistical
errors, resulting in any case lower than 10%. On
the other hand, it is known that the beam line can
produce a thin deposit of carbon over the target
[12]. Thus, the eﬀective beam energy was calcu-
lated taking into account the proton energy loss in
the carbon. The Rutherford Back-Scattering tech-
nique (RBS) with data from the PIPS was applied
to estimate the amount of carbon in the target for
each single run. Due to technical issues, this cor-
rection could only be applied to the second stage
set of data.

Results from both set of measurements are com-
pared with those from [6]. The agreement in shape
is very good although our cross-section is slightly
bigger in part of the overlapped range (between 3
and 10%). This can be result from our better es-
timation of the detection eﬃciency in the range of
interest. On the other hand, our data is still about
30% lower than that from [7], which suggests that
the normalization procedure adopted there was not
optimal. The position of the resonances of the sec-
ond stage set of data appears to be systematically
shifted by about 10 keV with respect to [6], but still
in agreement within the error with respect to the
values listed in [13]. This can be attributed to the
fact that the beam energy value is not corrected by
energy losses in the target (could be up to 10 keV
in this proton beam energy range), as mentioned
above.

Values for cross-sections are not given in Refs. [8]
and [5], but yields. Our data also agrees with them
both in shape and in resonances, although due to a
ﬁner step in proton beam energy and better detec-
tion resolution (both references used single crystal
NaI scintillation detectors) more resonances can be
found in our case. Besides, our measuring angle is
not the same than that for [8], [7] or [5], and not
even than that for [6], and it is reported [5] that the
angular distribution of photon emission is not ﬂat.

Acknowledgements

The high energy gamma-ray emission of the 16O
ﬁrst excited states was studied with the reaction
19F(p,αγ)16O at beam energies from 1.5 to 4.0
MeV. The corresponding gamma spectrum was
studied and reproduced in simulation. The detec-
tion eﬃciency was calculated and characterized in
the range of interest.

The diﬀerential cross-section for the whole group
of gamma rays between 5 and 7.2 MeV was calcu-
lated and the obtained curves are in agreement with
previous measurements in similar conditions. The
