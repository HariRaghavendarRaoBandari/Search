A microscopic version of the Continuum Discretized Coupled Channel (CDCC) method is used to
investigate 6He scattering on 27Al, 58Ni, 120Sn, and 208Pb at energies around the Coulomb barrier.
The 6He nucleus is described by an antisymmetric 6-nucleon wave function, deﬁned in the Resonating
Group Method. The 6He continuum is simulated by square-integrable positive-energy states. The
model is based only on well known nucleon-target potentials, and is therefore does not depend on
any adjustable parameter. I show that experimental elastic cross sections are fairly well reproduced.
The calculation suggests that breakup eﬀects increase for high target masses. For a light system such
as 6He+27Al, breakup eﬀects are small, and a single-channel approximation provides fair results.
This property is explained by a very simple model, based on the sharp-cut-oﬀ approximation for the
scattering matrix. I also investigate the 6He-target optical potentials, which conﬁrm that breakup
channels are more and more important when the mass increases. At large distances, polarization
eﬀects increase the Coulomb barrier, and provide a long-tail absorption component in the imaginary
part of the nucleus-nucleus interaction.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The 6He nucleus is the lightest exotic bound system.
Owing to its low separation energy (S2n = −0.973 MeV),
6He presents a large radius (2.33 ± 0.04 fm) compared to
the α particle (1.63 ± 0.03 fm) [1]. These observations
naturally lead to consider 6He as a halo nucleus, where
the α core is surrounded by two neutrons [2]. This halo
structure also exists in other exotic nuclei, such as 11Li,
11Be or 14Be, but the strong binding energy of the α
core makes 6He a particularly good candidate for precise
theoretical models.

Since the 90’s, the availability of radioactive beams
provided a rich information on the structure and prop-
erties of exotic nuclei [3, 4]. The ﬁrst experiments es-
sentially focused on reaction cross sections at high en-
ergies (see, for example, Ref. [5]). From simple semi-
classical models, the radius of the projectile can be de-
duced from reaction cross sections [6]. These high-energy
experiments have been complemented by breakup cross
sections, providing E1 strength distributions.
In most
neutron-rich light nuclei, these E1 distributions present
a peak at low energies [7].

More recently, several radioactive-beam experiments
were devoted to elastic scattering at low energies, i.e.
at energies around the Coulomb barrier. Typical exam-
ples are scattering experiments involving 6He, 8Li or 11Li
(see references in Ref. [8]). The main purpose of these
data is to provide information on the projectile structure
through a reaction model. In this context, the traditional
optical model presents several shortcomings, since the
structure of the colliding nuclei is neglected. Although
optical-model calculations may provide some information
on the range of the nucleus-nucleus interaction, they are
of limited use to derive properties of the projectile.

A signiﬁcant step forward is provided by the CDCC
(Coupled Channel Discretized Continuum) method [9,
10], where the structure of the projectile is taken into ac-
count. The CDCC formalism has been initially developed

to investigate deuteron-induced reactions [9]. Although
the deuteron is not considered as an exotic nucleus, its
low binging energy (B = 2.22 MeV) makes breakup chan-
nels quite important, even for elastic scattering. In the
CDCC model, the projectile breakup is simulated by a
discrete number of approximate continuum states. This
technique permits a strong improvement in the descrip-
tion of deuteron-nucleus cross sections.

In parallel with the development of radioactive beams,
the CDCC theory has been abundantly used. The low
binding energy of exotic nuclei makes CDCC an eﬃcient
tool, well appropriate to halo nuclei. Three-body CDCC
calculations (i.e. where the projectile is deﬁned in terms
of two clusters) have been performed on systems involv-
ing various projectiles, such as 8B [11], 11Be [12] or 17F
[13]. The main steps in CDCC calculations are: (1) the
determination of the projectile wave functions, includ-
ing approximate continuum states, referred to as pseu-
dostates; (2) the calculation of the projectile-target cou-
pling potentials; (3) the resolution of the coupled-channel
system; (4) from the scattering matrices and/or from the
wave functions, the calculation of the various cross sec-
tions (elastic scattering, breakup, fusion, etc).

The application of CDCC to three-body projectiles
(i.e., to four-body systems) is, in principle, straightfor-
ward, as the calculations follow the same procedure as
for two-body projectiles.
In practice, however, CDCC
calculations involving three-body projectiles are much
more demanding. A three-body model for the projectile
is obviously more complicated than a two-body model,
and the level density in the continuum is much higher,
leading to coupled-channel systems involving many equa-
tions (see, for example, Ref. [14]). The ﬁrst application
was performed on the 6He+209Bi elastic scattering [15].
Later, other reactions involving 6He [15], 9Be [14] or 11Li
[16] were analyzed with α + n + n, α+α+n or 9Li+n+n
descriptions of the projectile.
In most cases, breakup
channels play a crucial role to describe elastic scattering.
Even if the ground state wave function of the projectile

accurately reproduces the halo structure, single-channel
calculations are in general not able to account for the
experimental scattering cross sections.

This traditional CDCC approach, where the projectile
is described by a two- or by a three-body structure, faces
two major problems: (1) for complex projectiles, such as
11Li, the three-body model is a rather strong approxima-
tion, since it neglects the structure of the core; (2) more
important, optical potentials between the target and each
constituent of the projectile are often unknown, and
crude approximations are sometimes necessary. These
problems have been recently addressed by using a micro-
scopic description of the projectile (MCDCC, see Refs.
[17, 18]). In the MCDCC approach, the projectile wave
functions are obtained from a nucleon-nucleon interac-
tion. To describe the scattering process, only nucleon-
target optical potentials are necessary. These potentials
are well known over a broad range of masses and ener-
gies. A ﬁrst application was performed on the 7Li sys-
tem, where it was shown that the MCDCC provides an
excellent description of elastic and inelastic scattering,
without any adjustable parameter. In that calculation,
the 7-body wave functions of 7Li are deﬁned in a micro-
scopic α+ t cluster approximation, which has been tested
on many spectroscopic and scattering properties [19].

Our aim in the present work is to extend the MCDCC
to the 6He three-cluster projectile. In the spirit of Ref.
[17], I use microscopic 6He cluster wave functions, with
an exact antisymmetrization between the six nucleons.
The availability of 6He microscopic wave functions is re-
cent [20, 21], and provides an excellent opportunity to im-
prove the theoretical description of 6He scattering. I will
consider four systems (6He+27Al, 6He+58Ni, 6He+120Sn,
and 6He+208Pb) covering a wide range of target masses,
and which have been investigated in various experiments.
The present model oﬀers the possibility of a common
study with identical conditions of calculations except, of
course, in the nucleon-target interaction. The 6He nu-
cleus is a typical three-body system, and is fairly sim-
ple since the core is an α particle, known to be strongly
bound and with a spin 0+. General conclusions drawn
here can be, at least partly, extended to other weakly
bound three-body systems, such as 11Li or 14Be, which
are more diﬃcult to describe in a microscopic approach.
An interesting issue that will be also addressed is
the 6He+target potential. This has been discussed in
the past [22], and the conclusions are still controver-
sial [8].
It is now accepted that single-channel calcu-
lations, using standard 6He+target potentials, are not
able to reproduce experimental data on elastic scattering,
and that breakup channels cannot be neglected. Deduc-
ing equivalent potentials [23], including breakup eﬀects,
should bring a valuable information on the nature of the
6He+target interaction, and more generally, of the inter-
action involving exotic nuclei.

In Sec. II, I brieﬂy present the microscopic description
of 6He. Section III describes the MCDCC formalism.
In Sec. IV, I discuss the application to the 6He+27Al,

2

6He+58Ni, 6He+120Sn and 6He+208Pb elastic scattering.
I also try to derive general trends of the 6He-target inter-
action, derived from the MCDCC. In particular, I discuss
the role of the halo structure and of breakup in the 6He
scattering. Conclusions and outlook are presented in Sec.
V.

tial wave with spin jm and parity π reads

where Ti is the kinetic energy of nucleon i, and V N

ij are the nuclear and Coulomb interactions between
nucleons i and j. The nuclear term is taken as the Min-
nesota potential [24], involving the exchange parameter
u, and complemented by a zero-range spin-orbit force
[25].

Equation (1) is solved by using the cluster approxima-
tion. In other words, the 6He nucleus is represented by a
six-body wave function, but approximated by an α core
and two neutrons. This leads to the Resonating Group

where I use the hyperspherical formalism with ρ as hyper-
radius [20, 27]. In Eq. (3), A is the six-nucleon antisym-
metrizor, φα is a (0s)4 shell-model wave function of the α
particle, and φn is a spinor associated with the neutrons.
The total spin S = 0, 1 results from the coupling of the
neutron spins, and the total angular momentum ℓ from
the coupling of the angular momenta ℓx and ℓy, associ-
ated with the Jacobi coordinates xxx and yyy. Index γ stands
for γ = (ℓx, ℓy, ℓ, S), and the hypermoment K runs from
zero to inﬁnity. In practice a truncation value Kmax is
adopted. The hyperspherical functions Y ℓ
ℓxℓyK(Ωρ) are
well known (see, for example, Ref. [27]), and depend on
ﬁve angles Ωρ = (Ωx, Ωy, α), where α is the hyperangle.
The hyperradial functions χjπ
(k)γK(ρ) are to be determined
from the Schr¨odinger equation (1).

As for two-cluster systems, the RGM deﬁnition clearly
displays the physical interpretation of the cluster approx-
imation. In practice, however, using the Generator Coor-
dinate Method (GCM) wave functions is equivalent, and

is more appropriate to systematic numerical calculations
[25]. In the GCM, the wave function (3) is equivalently
written as

Ψjmπ

(k) =Xγ,KZ dR f jπ

(k)γK(R) Φjmπ

γK (R),

(4)

where R is the generator coordinate, Φjmπ
γK (R) are pro-
jected Slater determinants, and f jπ
(k)γK(R) are the gener-
ator functions (see Ref. [25] for more detail). In practice,
the integral is replaced by a sum over a ﬁnite set of R
values (typically 10 values are chosen).

After discretization of (4), the generator functions are
obtained from the eigenvalue problem, known as the Hill-
Wheeler equation,

(5)

where the Hamiltonian and overlap kernels are obtained
from 7-dimension integrals involving matrix elements be-
tween Slater determinants. These matrix elements are
computed with Brink’s formula [28], and the main part
of the numerical calculations is devoted to the multidi-
mension integrals (see Refs. [20, 25] for detail).

In addition to the overlap and Hamiltonian kernels

from the matrix elements (7). The sign ”−” correspond
to proton (p) density, and the sign ”+” to the neutron
(n) density. The densities are necessary to compute the
6He-target coupling potentials (see Sec. III). They are
expanded in multipoles [29, 30] as

(10)

For the sake of clarity in the notations, I do not explic-
itly write indices p and n for the proton and neutron
densities, respectively.

As usual in CDCC calculations, the continuum of the
projectile is simulated by positive-energy wave functions,
referred to as pseudostates. In other words, k values cor-
responding to Ejπ
(k) < 0 are physical states (for 6He only
the ground state is bound), and k values corresponding
to Ejπ
(k) > 0 are associated with pseudostates (or with
narrow resonances).

III. OUTLINE OF THE MCDCC

The MCDCC has been presented in Refs. [17, 18] for
I give here a brief outline, by
two-cluster projectiles.
emphasizing speciﬁcities of three-cluster projectiles. For
a system involving a projectile associated with H0 [see
Eq. (1)], the total Hamiltonian is deﬁned by

H = H0(rrri) + TR +Xi

viT (rrri − RRR),

(11)

where rrri are the internal coordinates of the projectile,
and RRR is the projectile-target relative coordinate. In the
isospin formalism, the interaction between nucleon i and
the target T reads

viT (sss) =(cid:0)

(12)

where ZT e is the charge of the target, and vpT (sss) and
vnT (sss) are proton and neutron optical potentials, respec-
tively. Their imaginary parts simulate the excitation of
the target.

In the CDCC formalism, the total wave function, as-

sociated with Hamiltonian (11) is expanded as

ΨJMπ(R) =XjkL

jkL (ΩR, rrri) gJπ
ϕJMπ

jkL(R),

where J and π are the total angular momentum and par-

ϕJMπ

jkL (ΩR, rrri) = iL(cid:20)Ψj

(k)(rrri) ⊗ YL(ΩR)(cid:21)JM

.

(14)

In Eq. (13), the sums over k and j are truncated at
a maximum energy Emax, and at a maximum angular
momentum jmax, respectively (notice that I assume that
the parity of the projectile is implied in j). The radial
functions gJπ
c (R) (I use c = (j, k, L)) are given by the

The calculation is performed by Fourier transforms of

[31]. Technical details are provided in Ref. [32].

At large distances,

i.e. when only the monopole
Coulomb interaction remains in (17), the solutions of the
coupled-channel system (15) are given by

The proton and neutron monopole densities of the
ground state are shown in Fig. 1 (for a spin j = 0, only
the monopole term λ = 0 contributes to the expansion
(10)). As expected, the neutron density presents a slow
decrease at large distance, in agreement with the pic-
ture of a ”neutron halo”. For comparison I also present
in Fig. 1 the densities obtained in the Green’s-function
Monte Carlo method with the Argonne v18 interaction
[41]. The goal of the present work is not to focus on an
optimal description of 6He. However, I have here a good
opportunity to compare the densities of the ground state
with those of an ab initio model. At large distances, the
proton densities are slightly lower in the present model,
as expected from the cluster approximation. However
the neutron densities, accurately described by a cluster
model, are very close to each other.

matrices UUU Jπ, which are used to compute cross sections
[35, 36]. System (15) is solved by the R-matrix technique,
using a Lagrange basis [37, 38]. This method represents
a useful tool to determine the scattering matrices, even
for many-channel calculations. The elastic cross sections
are then determined from standard formula [36].

IV. APPLICATION TO 6He SCATTERING

A. Conditions of the calculation

FIG. 1. Proton (ρp) and neutron (ρn) monopole densities of
the 6He ground state (jπ = 0+, k = 1 in Eq. (9)). The dashed
lines represent densities obtained with the ab initio model of
Ref. [41].

In the CDCC method, the ﬁrst step before the cross
section calculations is the determination of 6He wave
functions (3, 4). I take N = 8 values for the generator co-
ordinate associated with the hyperradius R (R = 1.5 fm
to 12 fm by step of 1.5 fm). The parameters of the Min-
nesota interaction are u = 1.0045 and S0 = 37 MeV.fm5
which reproduce the 6He binding energy (−0.973 MeV)
and the α + n phase shifts [39]. The oscillator parame-
ter is chosen as b = 1.36 fm, a standard value for the α
particle.

With these conditions, the matter and charge radii are

computed as √< r2 >m = 2.35 fm andp< r2 >p = 1.80

fm. The matter radius is in excellent agreement with ex-
periment (2.33±0.04 fm [1]). The charge radius has been
measured with a high accuracy (2.054± 0.014 fm), by us-
ing laser spectroscopy [40]. The RGM, as most cluster
theories (see the discussion in Ref. [40]) slightly under-
estimates this value. Most likely the t + t conﬁguration
might play a role to explain the experimental charge ra-
dius.

The 6He spectrum for the j = 0+ − 3− partial waves
is shown in Fig. 2 up to 15 MeV. The only bound state
is the 0+ ground state. The 2+ narrow resonance is pre-
dicted at an energy lower than experimentally, as already
observed in previous calculations [20]. It was shown in
Refs. [20, 21] that no narrow resonances are predicted in
the j = 1− and j = 3− partial waves. All states in these
partial waves therefore correspond to approximations of
the continuum.

Notice that I only include 6He states with natural par-
ity (−)j . Other partial waves (0−, 1+, 2−, 3+) are not
directly coupled to the ground state. They can be cou-
pled only to partial waves with j > 0, and are therefore
expected to play a negligible role. This will be discussed
in the next subsection.

B. Elastic cross sections

I consider diﬀerent systems where scattering data exist
around the Coulomb barrier (27Al, 58Ni, 120Sn, 208Pb).
These examples cover a wide range of target masses, and
are investigated here within the same model and the same
conditions of calculations. The optical potentials vpT and
vnT [see Eq. (12)] are taken from the compilation of Kon-
ing and Delaroche [42]. For the chosen targets, local po-
tentials exist, and are speciﬁcally ﬁtted to nucleon-target
data. This is in contrast with global potentials, whose
parameters are ﬁtted on diﬀerent systems, and then in-
terpolated to the system considered.

For all calculations, I use an R-matrix channel radius
a = 24 fm, with N = 120 mesh points. The maximum
angular momentum in the projectile target motion de-
pends on the system and on the relative energy (typically
Jmax ∼ 100 − 150). Many tests have been performed to
check that all cross sections are numerically stable for
small variations of these parameters.

I ﬁrst analyze the convergence of the cross sections with
the CDCC parameters jmax and Emax. This is presented
in Fig. 3 with the 6He+208Pb system, at Elab = 22 MeV,
where the convergence is the most critical. Figure 3(a)
illustrates the convergence with jmax. Clearly the single-
channel approximation is unable to reproduce the data.
This was also observed in a non-microscopic approach
[43]. With a truncation energy Emax = 15 MeV, the j =
0+ and j = 1− breakup contributions slightly improve
the agreement between theory and experiment, but a fair
agreement is obtained from jmax = 2. The convergence
is excellent up to θ ≈ 90◦, but remains fair even at large
backward angles. The slowness of the convergence at
energies close to the Coulomb barrier is well known [43].
The lower panel of Fig. 3 displays the convergence with
Emax. Angular momenta up to j = 3 are included. Again
the convergence is slow, and using the low truncation
energy Emax = 5 MeV overestimates the cross section

is the most critical for convergence. It is characterized
by a heavy target, and by a low incident energy (the
c.m. energy is Ec.m. = 21.4 MeV, which is close to the
Coulomb barrier VB = 18.4 MeV). For the other systems
considered here, the convergence with jmax and Emax is
faster, and is not illustrated.

tions for 6He scattering on 27Al, 58Ni, 120Sn and 208Pb,
respectively. These choices are guided by several rea-
sons: (i) covering a wide mass range, from light to heavy
targets; (ii) experimental data are available; (iii) local
nucleon-target interactions, i.e. speciﬁcally ﬁtted to nu-
cleon scattering data, have been determined [42].

Figure 4 shows the 6He+27Al system, at four energies.
These energies (Ec.m. = 7.8, 9.0, 9.8, 11.0 MeV) are sig-
niﬁcantly higher than the Coulomb barrier (VB ≈ 3.9
MeV). Although a slight improvement of the theoreti-
cal results is obtained within the multi-channel calcula-
tion, the single-channel approximation is not very dif-
ferent. A similar conclusion has been drawn recently for
the 9Be+27Al system, in a non microscopic CDCC model
[45]. This weak sensitivity to breakup channels will be

analyzed in more detail in Sec. IV.E.

In Figures 5 and 6, I present the 6He+58Ni and
6He+120Sn cross sections, respectively. Here the diﬀer-
ences between the full calculation and the single-channel
approximation are increasing. The converged results
are close to those of Ref. [43], where a non-microscopic
α+n+n description of 6He was used. In Fig. 7, I consider
the 6He+208Pb system, which was used as an illustration
of convergence issues in Fig. 3. The strong inﬂuence of
breakup channels is conﬁrmed at the three energies. Let
us emphasize that all cross sections are obtained with
the same conditions of calculations. The only diﬀerence
is that, of course, the choice of the neutron- and proton-
target potentials is adapted to each system.

Finally, let us brieﬂy discuss the role of non-natural-
parity partial waves of 6He (j = 0−, 1+, 2−, etc.). These
states cannot be coupled to the j = 0+ ground state, but
may play a role through couplings to the continuum. As a
full calculation, involving all pseudostates with jmax = 3
and Emax = 15 MeV is extremely demanding in terms of
computer time and memory, I have performed two cal-
culations with Emax = 10 MeV and j = 0+, 1−, 2+ or
j = 0±, 1±, 2±. The diﬀerence between the two cross
sections should provide a fair insight on the inﬂuence of
non-natural-parity states. The calculation has been done
for 6He+208Pb at Elab = 22 MeV. The diﬀerences in the
cross sections are, however, too small to be visible on a
ﬁgure. The cross sections diﬀer by less than 0.5%, and
are therefore not shown.

In Fig. 8, I present calculations for the 27Al and 208Pb
targets, either by including to core component only, or by
including the full density. In both cases, a single-channel
calculation is performed, in order to isolate halo eﬀects
from breakup eﬀects. In both systems, the diﬀerence is
small, in particular for 6He+27Al. Figure 8 shows, with
the 6He+208Pb system, that breakup eﬀects, obtained
with the full continuum, are more important than halo ef-
fects. This weak halo eﬀect can be explained by the small
diﬀerences in the folding potentials. A simple property
of folding potentials is related to the volume integrals as

Z V (rrr) drrr = AZ v(rrr) drrr,

(22)

where v(rrr) is the nucleon-target interaction (this iden-
tity holds for protons and neutrons separately). In other
words, changing the density does not aﬀect the volume
integral. The halo component of the neutron density (20)
therefore modiﬁes the range of the 6He-target potentials,
but this eﬀect is weak, as observed in the cross sections.

The accuracy of the polarization potential has been

D. Discussion of the 6He-target interaction

The present model, including breakup channels, oﬀers
the possibility to analyze equivalent 6He-target poten-
tials. Similar studies have been done for other projectiles,
in non-microscopic CDCC approaches (see, for example,
Refs. [15, 22, 51, 52]).

For a given partial wave Jπ, the equation associated

with the elastic channel ise written as

11 (R) − E(cid:19)gJπ

1 (R) =

(cid:18)TL(R) + V Jπ
−Xc>1

V Jπ
1c (R)gJπ

c (R).

(23)

A polarization potential Vpol can be deﬁned from

(cid:18)TL(R) + V Jπ

11 (R) + V Jπ

pol (R) − E(cid:19)gJπ

1 (R) = 0, (24)

where

V Jπ

pol (R) = −Pc>1 V Jπ

1c (R)gJπ
gJπ
1 (R)

c (R)

.

(25)

With this deﬁnition, Eqs. (23) and (24) are strictly equiv-
alent. However, the polarization potential (25) presents
two disadvantages: (i) it depends on J and π; (ii) it
presents singularities at the nodes of the wave function.
Thompson et al. [23] proposed an approximate, J in-

dependent, polarization potential as

Vpol(R) = −PJπ V Jπ

pol (R)ωJπ(R)

PJπ ωJπ(R)
11 |2)|gJπ

where ωJπ(R) is a weight function, chosen as

ωJπ(R) = (2J + 1)(1 − |U Jπ

1 (R)|2.

(27)

This choice permits to avoid singularities in the potential,
and to givet more weight on the important partial waves
(where |U Jπ
11 | ≪ 1). It has been abundantly used in the
literature (see references in Ref. [8]). The reliability of
the approximation can be tested by comparing the cross
sections obtained with (24) and with the original CDCC
calculation.

In Fig. 9, I present the total potential for the four sys-
tems considered here. Those potentials are determined
at typical energies (Ec.m. = 11.0, 11.1, 16.6, 21.4 MeV for
6He+27Al, 6He+58Ni, 6He+120Sn and 6He+208Pb, re-
spectively). The general trend is that the polarization
potential increases for heavy systems. This is consis-
tent with the conclusions drawn from the cross sections:
breakup eﬀects are weak for light targets, and increase
for heavier targets. The real part of the polarization po-
tential is always repulsive, as usually observed [8]. The
imaginary part has a long tail, and is responsible for the
long-range absorption. For the 208Pb target, the imagi-
nary part is negative beyond R = 11 fm, but presents a
shape diﬀerent from other targets. This behaviour is ex-
pected from the strong breakup eﬀects found with 208Pb.

FIG. 9.
(Color online). Single-channel potentials V11(R)
(solid lines) and total potentials V11(R) + Vpol(R) (dashed
lines). The upper panel (a) represents the real part, and the
lower panel (b) the imaginary part.

E. Discussion of 6He breakup eﬀects

I showed in the previous subsections that breakup ef-
fects are weak for 27Al, and increase for heavier targets.
This eﬀect can be traced in the scattering matrices U Jπ
11 .
For a given energy, the set of scattering matrices contains
the same information as the elastic cross section. Figure
10 displays the scattering matrices for the 27Al and 208Pb
targets, and for the single-channel and full calculations.
They are parametrized as

U Jπ
11 = |U Jπ

11 | exp(2iδJπ
11 ).

(28)

For 27Al and 208Pb, the shape are clearly diﬀerent.
Whereas low J values are completely absorbed by the
27Al target (U Jπ ≃ 0 for J ≤ 5), they are still partly
reﬂected in the 208Pb target. As a general statement,

this kind of ﬁgure presents three regions:

11 | ≈ 0 for low J values,
11 | ≈ 1 for high J values,

|U Jπ
|U Jπ
0 ≤ |U Jπ

11 | ≤ 1 for intermediate J values.

(29)

The precise shape of the nuclear potential does not
aﬀect neither region 1, nor region 2. Figure 10 shows
that region 3, where the scattering matrices are sensitive
to the interaction, is much wider for 208Pb than for 27Al.

In the limit of the sharp-absorption model, essentially
developed by Frahn [53] (see also Refs. [36, 54]), it is
assumed that the transition occurs at a grazing angu-
lar momentum Jg.
In other words, I have, within this
approximation

|U Jπ
|U Jπ

11 | = 0 for J ≤ Jg,
11 | = 1 for J > Jg.

(30)

The model also assumes (i) that the phase shifts δJπ
11 are
zero, (ii) that summations over the angular momentum
can be replaced by integrals. Even though this model has
been essentially developed with the aim of investigating
heavy-ion scattering at high energies, it remains valid
provided the assumptions are satisﬁed. Our goal here

9

is not to use Frahn’s model as a ﬁt of the data, but to
provide a simple estimate of the cross sections.

Under these conditions, the scattering cross section is

given by

w =(cid:20)

Jg(cid:19),

where η is the Sommerfeld parameter.

In (31), C(w) and S(w) are the Fresnel integrals. This
simple expression can be generalized to a smooth vari-
ation of the scattering matrix (30) around Jg [53, 54].
Although more physical, this extension leads to cross
sections more complicated than (31). As already men-
tioned, our aim is to provide a simple interpretation of
the CDCC cross sections, and not perform optimal ﬁts
of the data.

FIG. 11. (Color online). Scattering cross sections computed
with Eq. (31) (red lines) for the 6He+27Al (a) and 6He+208Pb
(b) systems. The black solid lines represent the full CDCC
calculations, and the dotted lines represent the single-channel
approximation.

In Fig. 11, I compare approximation (31) with the
CDCC calculations, for the 27Al and 208Pb targets. The
value of Jg is estimated from Fig. 10 (Jg = 9 for 27Al,
and Jg = 11 for 208Pb).

Let us ﬁrst discuss the 27Al target, where diﬀerences
between the single-channel and the full calculations are
found fairly weak. Here the Frahn approximation (31)
provides a good description of the data and, except for
θ . 20◦, is in reasonable agreement with CDCC. This
is consistent with the scattering-matrix distribution, and
explains why breakup eﬀects play a minor role. The data
on 6He+27Al scattering are weakly sensitive to the po-
tential. The only important parameter is the grazing an-
gular momentum Jg which is associated with the range
of the imaginary potential [54].

The situation is diﬀerent for the 6He+208Pb system.
Here, approximation (31) is rather poor, as expected
from the scattering matrices of Fig. 10. Therefore the
experimental cross section cannot be estimated from a
simple model, and is more sensitive to the optical po-
tential, or, in other words, to the inclusion of breakup
channels in the calculation.

V. CONCLUSION

In this work, I have applied the MCDCC method to the
6He nucleus, considered as an α + n + n three-cluster sys-
tem. The theory initiated in Ref. [17] for two-cluster pro-
jectiles was extended to three-cluster nuclei. Although
the main principles are identical, the numerical treatment
of microscopic three-cluster projectiles is much more in-
volved. The 6He system is typical of Borromean nuclei,
and is relatively simple since the core is a (0s)4 wave func-
tion. The conclusions drawn can be probably extended
to other nuclei such as 11Li or 14Be, more demanding
in terms of computer times since the core (9Li or 12Be)
involves p-shell orbitals.

The main advantage of the MCDCC is that it only
relies on nucleon-target optical potentials, which are in
general well known. I have considered four diﬀerent tar-
gets, 27Al, 58Ni, 120Sn, and 208Pb, which should cover
most typical masses. Around the Coulomb barrier, where
experimental data are available, the elastic cross sections
are fairly well reproduced by the model. In particular,
the 6He+208Pb data at large backwards angles are sen-
sitive to the conditions of the calculations. I have shown

10

that breakup channels are crucial to explain the large
experimental cross sections. As a general statement, I
ﬁnd that breakup eﬀects are weak for light targets, and
increase for heavier targets. Light systems have a low
Coulomb barrier. In that case, either the energy is sig-
niﬁcantly larger (say 2 or 3 times the Coulomb barrier),
and the scattering matrices follow the sharp cut-oﬀ ap-
proximation, or the energy is around the Coulomb bar-
rier, and most breakup channels are closed. As a conse-
quence, data with light targets should be very accurate,
and extend to large backwards angles to be sensitive to
the model.

This property is conﬁrmed by an analysis of equiva-
lent potentials. The polarization potential, induced by
breakup eﬀects, is small for light targets. The general
trend is that polarization eﬀects increase the Coulomb
barrier, and provide a long-range absorption in the imag-
inary component of the nucleus-nucleus interaction. The
importance of breakup channels has been analyzed within
the simple sharp cut-oﬀ approximation, where the scat-
tering matrix is supposed to be either 0 below a graz-
ing angular momentum, or 1 above this limit. Even if
this model is very basic, it provides a reasonable ﬁrst
guess of the physical cross sections, and explains the weak
breakup eﬀects obtained for 27Al.

The present model could be generalized in various di-
rections. Considering other projectiles, such as 11Li or
14Be is a challenge for microscopic theories. The main
limitation is the calculation of the GCM matrix elements
(6) which involve 7-dimension integrals. If the computer
times remain within reasonable limits for 6He, the neces-
sity of p-orbitals represents a huge increase in the com-
putational issues. Other aspects of 6He scattering, such
as breakup or fusion cross sections, are certainly worth
being investigated, and represent future applications of
the MCDCC.
