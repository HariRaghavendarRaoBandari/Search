In analogy with usual Anderson localization taking place in time-independent disordered quantum
systems where the disorder acts in conﬁguration space, systems exposed to temporally disordered
potentials can display Anderson localization in the time domain. We demonstrate this phenomenon
with one-dimensional examples where a temporally disordered potential induces localization during
the quantum evolution of wave-packets, in contrast with a fully delocalized classical dynamics. This
is an example of a time crystal phenomenon, i.e., a crystalline behavior in the time domain.

Anderson localization (AL) is the inhibition of trans-
port in a spatially disordered quantum system due to de-
structive interference [1]. It manifests itself in the expo-
nential localization of eigenstates in conﬁguration space,
while the classical dynamics is on the average diﬀusive.
Relying on the interference between paths multiply scat-
tered by the disorder – e.g. a disordered potential –
AL very much depends on the geometrical properties of
these paths and especially on the dimension of the sys-
tem. The scaling theory of localization [2] makes it possi-
ble to understand semi-quantitatively this behavior and
shows that AL is a generic behavior in one-dimensional
(1D) systems and in time-reversal invariant 2D systems.
In higher dimensions, localization usually takes place at
low energy, while high energy states are delocalized.

Although space and time do not play the same roles,
one may wonder whether a system where the potential
is a spatially “ordered” function, but a temporally “dis-
ordered” function, displays a phenomenon analogous to
AL, but in the time domain. It is the aim of this Letter
to show that the answer is positive.

A simple example of such a transposition between
space and time is already known in the context of local-
ization phenomena. The so-called “kicked rotor” model
describes a free rotor which is periodically (in time)
kicked by a spatially dependent potential. At long time,
it displays ”dynamical localization”, that is localization
in momentum space [3], which has been shown to be
equivalent to AL [4]. Moreover, the addition of temporal
modulations of the kick strength is tantamount to adding
spatial dimensions in the equivalent Anderson model [5–
7].

In the kicked rotor, the disordered character comes
from the classically chaotic dynamics when the kick
strength is suﬃciently strong. We will here use a dif-
ferent idea, namely directly incorporate the disordered
character in the temporal variations of the potential.

Recently, it has been proposed that crystalline phe-

nomena in the time domain can emerge due to sponta-
neous breaking of continuous time translation symmetry
to a discrete one [8, 9]. Such phenomena are termed
time crystals and there is debate in the literature as to
whether the formation of time crystals is possible [10–19].
In solid state physics, it is often assumed that space crys-
tals are already formed in a spontaneous process of space
translation symmetry breaking and their properties are
investigated with the help of space periodic potentials.
A similar approach can be applied in the time domain.
That is, periodically driven systems are able to reveal
crystalline behavior in time in analogy to Bloch wave so-
lutions of space periodic problems [19]. Here, we also
show that, if a periodically driven system is perturbed,
time periodic solutions become Anderson localized in a
similar way as extended Bloch states localize in the pres-
ence of a weak spatially disordered potential.

Let us begin with a time-independent system per-
turbed by a temporally disordered potential. A spatially
constant potential trivially does not aﬀect the dynamics.
We have thus to use a space-dependent potential. To
keep the spatial structure as simple as possible, we take
a 1D particle moving on a ring. The position of the par-
ticle is denoted by an angle θ and its momentum by p.
The particle experiences a time dependent perturbation
so that the classical Hamiltonian reads

where V is the amplitude of the perturbation and the
parameter α is introduced in order to remove degeneracy
of unperturbed motions corresponding to ±p. We assume
that f (t+ 2π/ω) = f (t) = Pk fkeikωt but, between t and
t + 2π/ω, it performs random ﬂuctuations, i.e. fk = f ∗

regular function displaying no disorder. In the following,
we concentrate on an example where g(θ) = θ/π for θ ∈
[−π, π[, i.e., g(θ) = Pn gneinθ where gn = i(−1)n
for n 6=
0 and g0 = 0.

Switching to the rotating frame, Θ = θ−ωt, we can see
that Θ becomes a slowly varying quantity if its canoni-
cally conjugate momentum fulﬁlls the resonance condi-
tion P = p− α− ω ≈ 0. Then, the motion of the particle
can be described by an eﬀective Hamiltonian Heﬀ that is
obtained by averaging the original Hamiltonian over the
fast time variable (the so-called secular approximation

For each realization of the random function f (t), the mo-
tion of the particle in the vicinity of the resonant tra-
jectory, i.e.
for |P| ≪ ω, is described by an integrable
Hamiltonian (2). The Hamiltonian (2) does not depend
on ω apart from the last constant term. However, the
validity of the eﬀective Hamiltonian does depend on ω.

resonant motion of the system is perfectly described by

The Hamiltonian (2) indicates that the particle eﬀec-
tively experiences a disorder potential. We will con-

sider an example where |gkfk| =
Arg(fk) are random variables chosen uniformly in the
interval [0, 2π[. This requires that many gk coeﬃcients
are non-zero, that is a spatial dependance of the poten-
tial with many Fourier components; it excludes potentials
with a simple sinusoidal dependance. Actually, the secu-
lar term in the eﬀective Hamiltonian (2) can be thought
of as the coherent addition of resonant terms between the
spatial harmonics of the potential and the corresponding
temporal harmonics of the disordered driving amplitude.

boundary conditions, it is visible only if the localization
length ξloc ≪ 2π. In 1D systems, ξloc is essentially twice
the transport mean free path [21].
In the weak disor-
der limit, it can be computed using the Born approxima-
tion, from the power spectrum of the potential correlation
function and the disorder-free density of states [21, 22].
In our case, this gives:

the so-called correlation energy [22] (throughout this pa-
per, we assume  = 1). Eζ is the energy scale separating
two qualitatively diﬀerent regimes. If E ≪ Eζ , the de

In Fig. 1, an exemplary eigenstate of the quantum
version of the eﬀective Hamiltonian (2) is presented for

V = 4 × 103, k0 = 103 and α = (√5 − 1)/2 [23]. The
energy of this state is close to E − ω2/2 = 8 × 103, so
that V 2/EEζ = 0.004 ≪ 1, and the Born approximation
can be used. It predicts ξloc = 0.30. Numerical calcula-
tion using the transfer matrix method [24] agrees with
this value within 1%. Single eigenstates do not display a
perfect exponential localization, so that there are state-
to-state ﬂuctuations of the estimated localization length,
making the observed length 0.17 fully compatible with
the theoretical calculation.

The original Hamiltonian (1) is a periodic function of
time. Thus, in the quantum description we can employ
the Floquet theorem [20], which is the analogue of the
Bloch theorem in the time domain, and calculate quasi-
energy eigenstates. These eigenstates, called Floquet
states, are periodic eigenfunctions of the Floquet Hamil-
tonian HF = H(t) − i∂t. Eigenstates of the eﬀective
Hamiltonian (2) are actually Floquet states within the
secular approximation. When we return from the rotat-
ing frame to the laboratory frame, all eigenstates of (2)
perform a periodic motion with period 2π
ω . Anderson lo-
calized eigenstates of (2) appear in the laboratory frame
as periodically evolving exponentially localized density
proﬁles. If we ﬁx the position in the laboratory frame,

we observe that probability density for a measurement of
the particle at this position reveals a proﬁle that is ex-
ponentially localized around a certain t0, cf. Fig. 1. The
proﬁle comes back periodically with period 2π
ω . Thus, one
deals with the situation analogue to a time-independent
1D problem of a particle in a disorder potential with pe-
riodic boundary conditions.

AL considered here is induced by a time ﬂuctuating
perturbation not by a spatial disorder and appears in
the time domain. In the case of a particle on a ring, an
exponential localization is observed in time (for a ﬁxed
position in the conﬁguration space) but also in the conﬁg-
uration space (at a ﬁxed time) which is a speciﬁc property
of the ring problem.
In general, an exponential local-
ization is only present in the time domain, as discussed
below.

We now consider a slightly diﬀerent problem. The for-
mation of time crystals is related to spontaneous break-
ing of time translation symmetry, in analogy with the
spontaneous breaking of space translation symmetry in
the formation of usual space crystals [8, 9]. We will not
consider the formation of time crystals, but try to simu-
late time crystal phenomena with the help of periodically
driven systems [19]. This is in analogy with the stan-
dard approach of solid state physics where space periodic
Hamiltonians are used to model properties of space crys-
tals. Let us assume that an unperturbed Hamiltonian for
a particle on a ring reads H0 = (p−α)2
2 +λ cos(sθ) cos(sωt)
where the integer s ≫ 1. When we switch to the rotating
frame, the new variable Θ = θ−ωt is a slow variable (sim-
ilarly to the previous discussion) and the secular eﬀective
Hamiltonian H0,eﬀ = P 2
2 describes quan-
titatively the resonant motion if λ2
ω2 ≪ 1. Our problem
has been reduced to a particle in an external periodic
potential. The eigenstates of H0,eﬀ are solutions of the
Mathieu equation [20]. In the limit of large amplitude λ
and large s (with √λ/s ≫ 1), they appear in the labora-

tory frame as trains of s localized wavepackets arriving
periodically at any chosen point on the ring. This is a
model of time crystals obtained with the help of a pe-
riodically driven system. If we add to the unperturbed
Hamiltonian H0 the same perturbation than in (1), the
full eﬀective Hamiltonian of the system reads,

For V ≪ λ, we deal with a particle in a periodic lat-

(2j + 1)π/s for 0 ≤ j < s, perturbed by a weak dis-
order potential. If we can restrict to the lowest energy
band of the periodic lattice, we can further simplify the
description by deriving the standard Anderson Hamil-
tonian. When ζ is shorter than 2π/s, the disorder is

the laboratory frame. Panels show probability density for the
measurement of a particle at a ﬁxed point on a ring versus
time, for eigenstates with energy in the middle of the lowest

tice and is given by J = (25λ3s2/π2)1/4 exp(−
In the weak disorder limit V ≪ J, the localization length
at the center of the band reads ξloc = 8πJ 2/sV 2 [21].
Figure 2(a) shows the evolution of the probability density
for the particle detection at a ﬁxed position in the labo-
ratory frame, for an eigenstate in the middle of the band.
For the parameters of the ﬁgure, we obtain J = 7.57, so
that we are not fully in the perturbative limit. Never-
theless the predicted localization length is ξloc = 0.144
in good agreement with the results in the ﬁgure. Note
that the Hamiltonian (4) also predicts the possibility of
AL in higher energy bands. In the ﬁrst excited band, the
asymptotic solutions of the Mathieu equation [26] predict
J to be 32 times larger than in the lowest band. For a V
value 30 times larger than in Fig. 2(a), the localization
length should be similar to the case of the lowest band;
that is indeed observed in Fig. 2(b).

We have illustrated AL in the time domain with the
simple problem of a particle on a ring. However, the phe-
nomenon is general and can be realized in a broad class
of systems. Assume that we have an integrable 1D sys-
tem described by a classical Hamiltonian H0(x, p) which
is perturbed by a time-dependent potential of the form
V g(x)f (t) where f (t) is a randomly ﬂuctuating function
but fulﬁlls f (t + 2π/ω) = f (t) and g(x) is a regular func-
tion. For example, we can think of a particle bounc-
ing on a mirror whose position ﬂuctuates in time; then,
H0(x, p) = p2
2 + x and g(x) = x [20]. The canonical
transformation to the angle-action variables (θ, J) of the

unperturbed problem allows one to write a full Hamil-
tonian in the form H = H0(J) + V g(θ, J)f (t). Periodic
solutions of the unperturbed system possess very sim-
ple forms in the angle-action variables, i.e. J =constant
and θ = H′0(J)t+constant, where H′0 = ∂H0
∂J . Let us
stress that the canonical transformation between (x, p)
and (θ, J) is usually non-linear. On the other hand, the
previous equation shows that the angle variable θ changes
always linearly with time on an unperturbed orbit. By

expanding g(J, θ) = Pn gn(J)einθ and f (t) in Fourier se-

ries, one can perform the standard approach for resonant
motion that yields the eﬀective secular Hamiltonian

Heﬀ =

modulo a constant term, where Θ = θ− ωt and J0 fulﬁlls
the resonant condition ω = H′0(J0). Such an eﬀective
Hamiltonian has the same form than (2). If, in addition,
we apply a periodic driving λg(x) cos(sωt), the result-
ing eﬀective Hamiltonian will be of the form (4) [27].
Thus, in terms of the angle-action variables, we obtain
the same kind of behavior: AL phenomena can be ex-
pected. There is, however, one diﬀerence. AL is iden-
tiﬁed and described in the rotating frame in terms of
angle-action variables. When one tries to plot the proba-
bility density of a localized state in the laboratory frame
as a function of x (for ﬁxed t), one does not observe
in general an exponentially localized proﬁle because the
canonical transformation from (Θ, J) to (x, p) is generi-
cally non-linear. However, the temporal evolution of the
probability of detecting the particle at a ﬁxed position
x is always exponentially localized around a certain t0.
Indeed, our temporal AL takes place along a periodic
orbit of the unperturbed system, resonant with the time-
dependent perturbation. As the relation between t and
Θ is always linear for an unperturbed motion, AL in the
Θ space also means exponential localization in time.

Finally let us discuss possible realizations of AL in
the time domain in higher dimensional systems. Assume
that, in a 3D case, the Hamiltonian of a one-particle sys-
tem can be written, in the angle-action variables (θi, Ji),
as H0(J1) + V (θ1, θ2, θ3; J1, J2, J3; t) where V ﬂuctuates
in time but fulﬁlls V (t + 2π/ω) = V (t). This occurs,
e.g., in the Hydrogen atom perturbed by a ﬂuctuating
electromagnetic ﬁeld where J1 is the principal action, θ1
denotes the position of the electron on an unperturbed
elliptical orbit, while (θ2, J2, θ3, J3) deﬁne the shape and
orientation of the orbit. It may happen that, even if the
perturbation is on, there is a stable resonant periodic
orbit where (θ2, J2, θ3, J3) remain nearly constant [20].
Then, the eﬀective Hamiltonian of the θ1 degree of free-
dom can be reduced to a form similar to (5) and AL of
the electron can take place.

A key point for a possible experimental observation
of AL in the time domain is that both the temporally

4

“disordered” periodic driving and the “regular” inner po-
tential must contain many harmonics of the fundamen-
tal frequency. Thanks to modern electronics, creating
a complex temporal proﬁle of the driving is not neces-
sarily diﬃcult. Getting a highly anharmonic potential
requires a speciﬁc system. In the example used in this
Letter, the high-order spatial harmonics come from the
discontinuity of the potential g(θ) in (1). In a more re-
alistic system, it will require some kind of singularity. A
ﬁrst example could be a cold atom bouncing on an op-
tical mirror (created by an evanescent wave [28]) whose
eﬀective position is modulated in time. Another possibil-
ity would be to use the dynamics of a Rydberg electron
[29]. There the close encounters with the nucleus are re-
sponsible for a highly anharmonic classical motion and
consequently Fourier components decrease only slowly at
large order [20]. Driving the Rydberg electron with a
temporally disordered microwave ﬁeld could lead to AL
in the time domain. Let us also mention the possibility
of trapping a cold atomic gas in a ring-shaped trap whose
parameters can be modulated in time or the use of rings
of superconducting or normal metal devices [30].

To summarize, we have proposed a new scenario for the
observation of Anderson localization, based on a tempo-
rally disordered driving of a quantum system. In proper
conditions, it leads to the spontaneous appearance of
wavepackets Anderson localized along an unperturbed
periodic trajectory.
