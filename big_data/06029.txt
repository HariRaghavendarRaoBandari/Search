Abstract

We obtain a nonsmooth higher-order extension of Noether’s symmetry theorem for vari-
ational isoperimetric problems with delayed arguments. The result is proved to be valid in
the class of Lipschitz functions, as long as the delayed higher-order Euler–Lagrange extremals
are restricted to those that satisfy the delayed higher-order DuBois–Reymond necessary op-
timality condition. The important case of delayed isoperimetric optimal control problems is
considered as well.

Keywords: time delays; invariance; symmetries; isoperimetric conservation laws; DuBois–
Reymond necessary optimality condition; Noether’s theorem; optimal control.

Introduction

Noether’s theorem, published in 1918 [21] ina seminal work, is a central result of the calculus of
variations that explains all physical conservation laws based upon the action principle. It is a very
general result, asserting that “to every variational symmetry of the problem there corresponds a
conservation law”. Noether’s principle gives powerful insights from the various transformations
that make a system invariant. For instance, in mechanics the invariance of a physical system with
respect to spatial translation gives conservation of linear momentum; invariance with respect to
rotation gives conservation of angular momentum; and invariance with respect to time translation
gives conservation of energy [18]. As a consequence, the Noether’s theorem is usually considered the
most important mathematical theorem of the twentieth century for Physics. On the other hand, the
calculus of variations is now part of a more vast discipline, called optimal control [22], and Noether’s
principle still holds in this more general setting [24]. Within the years, this result has been studied
by many authors and generalized in diﬀerent directions: see [1, 5–7, 13, 19, 20, 24] and references
therein. In particular, in the recent paper [8, 9], Noether’s theorem was formulated for variational
problems with delayed arguments. The result is important because problems with delays play a
crucial role in the modeling of real-life phenomena in various ﬁelds of applications [4, 10, 12]. In
order to prove Noether’s theorem with delays, it was assumed that admissible functions are C2-
smooth and that Noether’s conserved quantity holds along all C2-extremals of the Euler–Lagrange
equations with time delay [7]. Here we show that to formulate higher-order Noether’s theorem

1

with time delays for nonsmooth functions, it is enough to restrict the set of delayed isoperimetric
higher-order Euler–Lagrange extremals to those that satisfy the delayed isoperimetric higher-
order DuBois–Reymond condition. Moreover, we prove that this result can be generalized to more
general isoperimetric optimal control problemas.

The text is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give a short review of the results for the funda-
mental isoperimetric problem of variational calculus with delayed arguments. The main contribu-
tions of the paper appear in Sections 3 and 4: we prove an Euler–Lagrange and DuBois–Reymond
optimality type conditions for nonsmooth higher-order isoperimetric variational problems with
delayed arguments (Theorems 16 and 19, respectively), isoperimetric higher-order Noether sym-
metry theorem with time delay for Lipschitz functions (Theorem 25) and a delayed Noether’s
symmetry theorem (Theorem 33) for isoperimetric optimal control problems. Two examples of
application are given in Section 5.

2 Preliminaries

In this section we review necessary results on the calculus of variations with time delay. For more
on variational problems with delayed arguments we refer the reader to [2, 3, 12, 14, 16, 17, 23].

We begin by deﬁning the isoperimetric variational problem as in [9].

Problem 1. (The isoperimetric variational problem with time delay) The isoperimetric problem
of the calculus of variations consists of minimizing a functional

J τ [q(·)] =Z t2

t1

L (t, q(t), ˙q(t), q(t − τ ), ˙q(t − τ )) dt

subject to the isoperimetric equality constraints

I τ [q(·)] =Z t2

t1

and boundary conditions

g (t, q(t), ˙q(t), q(t − τ ), ˙q(t − τ )) dt = l,

l ∈ Rk ,

q(t) = δ(t) for t ∈ [t1 − τ, t1] and q(t2) = qt2 .

(1)

(2)

(3)

.

We assume that L, g : [t1, t2] × R4 → R, are a C2-functions with respect to all their arguments,
admissible functions q(·) are C2-smooth, t1 < t2 are ﬁxed in R, τ is a given positive real number
such that τ < t2 − t1, l is a speciﬁed real constant and δ is a given piecewise smooth function on
[t1 − τ, t1].

Throughout the text, ∂iL denotes the partial derivative of L with respect to its ith argument.

For convenience of notation, we introduce the operator [·]τ deﬁned by

[q]τ (t) = (t, q(t), ˙q(t), q(t − τ ), ˙q(t − τ )).

The arguments of the calculus of variations assert that, by using the Lagrange multiplier rule,

Problem 1 is equivalent to the following augmented problem [11, §12.1]: to minimize

F [q, λ]τ (t)dt

t1

J τ [q(·), λ] =Z t2
:=Z t2

t1

[L[q]τ (t) − λ · g[q]τ (t)] dt

subject to (3), where [q, λ]τ (t) = (t, q(t), ˙q(t), q(t − τ ), ˙q(t − τ ), λ).

The augmented Lagrangian

F := L − λ · g, λ ∈ R

(4)

(5)

has an important role in our study.

The notion of extremizer (a local minimizer or a local maximizer) can to be found in [11].

Extremizers can be classiﬁed as normal or abnormal.

Deﬁnition 2. An extremizer of Problem 1 that does not satisfy the Euler–Lagrange equations

t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2.

t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ,

(6)

is said to be a normal extremizer; otherwise (i.e., if it satisﬁes (6) for all t ∈ [t1, t2]), is said to
be abnormal.

The following theorem gives a necessary condition for q(·) to be a solution of Problem 1 under

the assumption that q(·) is a normal extremizer.

Theorem 3. If q(·) ∈ C2 ([t1 − τ, t2]) is a normal extremizer to Problem 1, then it satisﬁes the
following isoperimetric Euler–Lagrange equation with time delay:

d
dt {∂3F [q, λ]τ (t) + ∂5F [q, λ]τ (t + τ )}
= ∂2F [q, λ]τ (t) + ∂4F [q, λ]τ (t + τ ),
d
dt ∂3F [q, λ]τ (t) = ∂2F [q, λ]τ (t),

t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2 ,

t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ,

(7)




t ∈ [t1, t2], where F is the augmented Lagrangian (5) associated with Problem 1.

Remark 4. If one extends the set of admissible functions in problem (1)–(3) to the class of
Lipschitz continuous functions, then the isoperimetric Euler–Lagrange equations (7) remain valid.
This result is obtained from our Corollary 17 by choosing m = 1.

Deﬁnition 5 (Isoperimetrc extremals with time delay). The solutions q(·) ∈ C2 ([t1 − τ, t2]) of
the Euler–Lagrange equations (7) are called isoperimetric extremals with time delay.

Theorem 6 (Isoperimetric DuBois–Reymond necessary condition with time delay [9]). If q(·) is
an isoperimetric extremals with time delay such that

∂4F [q]τ (t + τ ) · ˙q(t) + ∂5F [q]τ (t + τ ) · ¨q(t) = 0

for all t ∈ [t1 − τ, t2 − τ ], then it satisﬁes the following conditions:

d
dt

{F [q]τ (t) − ˙q(t) · (∂3F [q]τ (t) + ∂5F [q]τ (t + τ ))} = ∂1F [q]τ (t)

for t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ , and

d
dt

{F [q]τ (t) − ˙q(t) · ∂3F [q]τ (t)} = ∂1F [q]τ (t)

(8)

(9)

(10)

for t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2, where F is deﬁned in (5).

Remark 7. If we assume that admissible functions in problem (1)–(3) are Lipschitz continuous,
then one can show that the DuBois–Reymond necessary conditions with time delay (9) are still
valid (cf. Corollary 20 by choosing m = 1).

Deﬁnition 8 (Invariance up to a gauge-term). Consider the following s-parameter group of in-
ﬁnitesimal transformations:

(¯t = t + sη(t, q) + o(s) ,

¯q(t) = q(t) + sξ(t, q) + o(s),

(11)

3

where η ∈ C1(R) and ξ ∈ C1(R2). We say that functional (4) is invariant under the s-parameter
group of inﬁnitesimal transformations (11) up to the gauge-term Φ if

˙Φ[q]τ (t)dt =

(12)

for any subinterval I ⊆ [t1, t2] and for all q(·) ∈ Lip ([t1 − τ, t2]) .

Deﬁnition 9 (Isoperimetric constant of motion/isoperimetric conservation law with time delay).
We say that a quantity C(t, t + τ, q(t), q(t − τ ), q(t + τ ), ˙q(t), ˙q(t − τ ), ˙q(t + τ )) is an isoperimetric
constant of motion with time delay τ if

d
dt

C(t, t + τ, q(t), q(t − τ ), q(t + τ ), ˙q(t), ˙q(t − τ ), ˙q(t + τ )) = 0

(13)

along all the extremals q(·) (cf. Deﬁnition 5). The equality (13) is then an isoperimetric conser-
vation law with time delay.

The next theorem establishes an extension of Noether’s theorem to isoperimetric problems of

the calculus of variations with time delay.

Theorem 10 (Isoperimetric Noether’s symmetry theorem with time delay for Lipschitz functions
[9]). If functional (1) is invariant up to Φ in the sense of Deﬁnition 8, then the quantity C(t, t +
τ, q(t), q(t − τ ), q(t + τ ), ˙q(t), ˙q(t − τ ), ˙q(t + τ )) deﬁned by

− Φ[q]τ (t) + (∂3F [q]τ (t) + ∂5F [q]τ (t + τ )) · ξ(t, q(t))

for t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ and by

+(cid:16)F [q]τ − ˙q(t) · (∂3F [q]τ (t) + ∂5F [q]τ (t + τ ))(cid:17)η(t, q(t))

− Φ[q]τ (t) + ∂3F [q]τ (t) · ξ(t, q(t)) +(cid:16)F [q]τ − ˙q(t) · ∂3F [q]τ (t)(cid:17)η(t, q(t))

for t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2 , is a constant of motion with time delay along any q(·) ∈ Lip ([t1 − τ, t2])
satisfying both (7) and (9)-(10), i.e., along any Lipschitz Euler–Lagrange extremal that is also a
Lipschitz DuBois–Reymond extremal that satisfy the condition (8).

3 Nonsmooth higher-order Noether’s theorem for isoperi-
metric problems of the calculus of variations with time
delay

Let Wk,p, k ≥ 1, 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, denote the class of functions that are absolutely continuous with their
derivatives up to order k − 1, the kth derivative belonging to Lp. With this notation, the class Lip
of Lipschitz functions is represented by W1,∞. We now extend previous results to isoperimetric
problems with higher-order derivatives.

3.1 Higher-order Euler–Lagrange and DuBois–Reymond optimality con-

ditions with time delay

Let m ∈ N and q(i)(t) denote the ith derivative of the vector q(t) deﬁned in Rn (n ∈ N∗),
i = 0, . . . , m, with q(0)(t) = q(t). For simplicity of notation, we introduce the operator [·]m

τ by

[q]m

τ (t) :=(cid:16)t, q(t), ˙q(t), . . . , q(m)(t), q(t − τ ), ˙q(t − τ ), . . . , q(m)(t − τ )(cid:17).

Consider the following higher-order isoperimetric variational problem with time delay:

boundary conditions (3) and q(i)(t2) = qi
t2 , i = 1, . . . , m − 1. The functions L, g : [t1, t2] ×
R2n(m+1) → R are assumed to be a Cm+1-function with respect to all their arguments, admissible
functions q(·) are assumed to be Wm,∞, t1 < t2 are ﬁxed in R, τ is a given positive real number
t2 are given vectors in Rn, i = 1, . . . , m − 1 , l is a speciﬁed real constant
such that τ < t2 − t1, qi
and δ is a given piecewise smooth function on [t1 − τ, t1].

Remark 12. When m = 1 and n = 1 the Problem 11 reduces to Problem 1.

In [8] the authors proved the following corollary:

Corollary 13 (Higher-order Euler–Lagrange equations with time delay in diﬀerential form). If
q(·) ∈ Wm,∞ ([t1 − τ, t2], Rn) is an extremal of functional (16), then

The previous corollary motivates the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 14. An admissible function q(·) ∈ Wm,∞ ([t1 − τ, t2], Rn) is an extremal for problem
(17)–(3) if it satisﬁes the following Euler–Lagrange equations with time delay:

Now we extend notion of normal extremizer (Deﬁnition 2) to higher-order normal extremizer

for isoperimetric problems of the calculus of variations with time delay.

Deﬁnition 15. An extremizer of Problem 11 that does not satisfy (18)–(19) is said to be a higher-
order normal extremizer; otherwise (i.e., if it satisﬁes (18)–(19) for all t ∈ [t1, t2]), is said to be
higher-order abnormal extremizer.

The next theorem is crucial for our purposes.

Theorem 16 (Isoperimetric higher-order Euler–Lagrange equations with time delay in integral
form). If q(·) ∈ Wm,∞ ([t1 − τ, t2], Rn) is a higher-order normal extremizer of Problem 11, then

a polynomial of order m − 1, i.e., p(t) = c0 + c1t + · · · + cm−1tm−1 for some constants ci ∈ R,
i = 0, . . . , m − 1.

Proof. Consider neighboring functions of the form

ˆq(t) = q(t) + ǫ1h1(t) + ǫ2h2(t),

(22)

where for each κ ∈ {1, 2} ǫκ is a suﬃciently small parameter, hκ ∈ Wm,∞ ([t1 − τ, t2], Rn),
h(i)
κ (t2) = h(i)

κ (t2 − τ ) = 0, i = 0, . . . , m − 1, and hκ(t) = 0, t ∈ [t1 − τ, t1] .

First we will show that (22) has a subset of admissible functions for the variational isoperimetric

problem with time delay. Consider the quantity

I τ

m[ˆq(·)] =Z t2

t1

g[ˆq]m

τ (t)dt.

Then we can regard I τ

m[ˆq(·)] as a function of ǫ1 and ǫ2. Deﬁne ˆI(ǫ1, ǫ2) = I τ

m[ˆq(·)] − l. Thus,

Since q(·) ∈ Wm,∞ ([t1 − τ, t2], Rn) is a higher-order normal extremizer of Problem 11, by the
fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations (see, e.g., [27]), there exists a function h2 such
that

6= 0 .

(29)

Using (23) and (29), the implicit function theorem asserts that there exists a function ǫ2(·), deﬁned
in a neighborhood of zero, such that ˆI(ǫ1, ǫ2(ǫ1)) = 0. Consider the real function ˆJ(ǫ1, ǫ2) =
m[ˆq(·)]. By hypothesis, ˆJ has minimum (or maximum) at (0, 0) subject to the constraint ˆI(0, 0) =
J τ
0, and we have proved that ∇ ˆI(0, 0) 6= 0. We can appeal to the Lagrange multiplier rule (see,
e.g., [27, p. 77]) to assert the existence of a number λ such that ∇( ˆJ (0, 0) − λ · ˆI(0, 0)) = 0.

reduce to (7).

We ﬁnally obtain (37) by the arbitrariness x ∈ [t1, t2 − τ ] .

In the particular case when m = 1 and n = 1, we obtain from Theorem 19 an extension of

Theorem 6 to the class of Lipschitz functions.

Corollary 20 (Nonsmooth isoperimetric DuBois–Reymond conditions). If
q(·) ∈ Lip ([t1 − τ, t2]; R) is a normal isoperimetric extremals with time delay, then the DuBois–
Reymond conditions with time delay (9) and (10) hold true.

Proof. For m = 1, the hypothesis (36) is reduced to (8), condition (37) to

One ﬁnds the intended equalities (9) and (10) by substituting the quantities (44) and (45) into
(42) and (43), respectively.

3.2

Isoperimetric higher-order Noether’s symmetry theorem with time
delay

Now, we generalize the Noether-type theorem (Theorem 10) to the more general case of delayed
isoperimetric variational problems with higher-order derivatives.

We know (see Section 3.1) that by using the Lagrange multiplier rule, Problem 11 is equivalent

to the following augmented problem: to minimize

The notion of variational invariance for Problem 11 is deﬁned with the help of the equivalent

augmented Lagrangian (46).

Remark 26. In the particular case when ϕ(t, q, u, qτ , uτ ) = u, problem (60)–(63) is reduced to the
Problem 1. The problems of the calculus of variations with higher-order derivatives are also easily
written in the optimal control form (60)–(63). For example, the delayed isoperimetric problem of
the calculus of variations with derivatives of second order,

I[q(·)] =Z t2

t1

F (t, q(t), ˙q(t), ¨q(t), q(t − τ ), ˙q(t − τ ), ¨q(t − τ )) −→ min ,

(64)

is equivalent to problem

˙q0(t) = q1(t) ,
˙q1(t) = u(t) ,

where F = L − λ · g and g = g (t, q(t), ˙q(t), ¨q(t), q(t − τ ), ˙q(t − τ ), ¨q(t − τ )) .

Notation. We introduce the operators [·, ·]τ and [·, ·, ·]τ deﬁned by

[q, u]τ (t) = (t, q(t), u(t), q(t − τ ), u(t − τ )) ,

where q(·) ∈ C1 ([t1 − τ, t2], Rn) and u(·) ∈ C0 ([t1 − τ, t2], Rm); and

[q, u, p, λ]τ (t) = (t, q(t), u(t), q(t − τ ), u(t − τ ), p(t), λ) ,

where q(·) ∈ C1 ([t1 − τ, t2], Rn), p(·) ∈ C1 ([t1, t2], Rn), u(·) ∈ C0 ([t1 − τ, t2], Rm) and λ ∈ Rk.

Deﬁnition 27. The delayed diﬀerential control system (61) is called an isoperimetric control
system with time delay.

Deﬁnition 28. (Isoperimetric process with time delay) An admissible pair (q(·), u(·)) that sat-
isﬁes the isoperimetric control system (61) and the isoperimetric constraints (62) is said to be a
isoperimetric process with time delay.

Theorem 29. (Isoperimetric Pontryagin maximum principle [9]) If (q(·), u(·)) is a minimizer of
(60)–(63), then there exists a covector function p(·) ∈ C1 ([t1, t2], Rn) such that for all t ∈ [t1−τ, t2]
the following conditions hold:

• the isoperimetric Hamiltonian systems with time delay

( ˙q(t) = ∂6H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t)

˙p(t) = −∂2H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t) − ∂4H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t + τ )

for t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ , and

for t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2;

( ˙q(t) = ∂6H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t)

˙p(t) = −∂2H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t)

• the isoperimetric stationary conditions with time delay

∂3H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t) + ∂5H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t + τ ) = 0

for t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ , and

for t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2;

∂3H[q, u, p]τ (t) = 0

where the isoperimetric Hamiltonian H is deﬁned by

(65)

(66)

(67)

(68)

H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t) = L[q, u]τ (t) − λ · g[q, u]τ (t) + p(t) · ϕ[q, u]τ (t).

(69)

Deﬁnition 30. A triplet (q(·), u(·), p(·)) satisfying the conditions of Theorem 29 is called an
isopereimetric Pontryagin extremal with time delay.

We deﬁne the notion of invariance for Problem (60)–(63) in terms of the Hamiltonian, by

introducing the augmented functional as in [3]:

J [q(·), u(·), p(·)] =Z t2

t1

[H(t, q(t), u(t), q(t − τ ), u(t − τ ), p(t)) − p(t) · ˙q(t)] dt

(70)

subject to (63), where H is given by (69). The notion of invariance for (60)–(61) is deﬁned using
the invariance of (70).

Deﬁnition 31 (cf. Deﬁnition 8). Consider the following s-parameter group of inﬁnitesimal trans-
formations:

¯t = t + sη(t, q, u) + o(s),
¯q(t) = q(t) + sξ(t, q, u) + o(s),
¯u(t) = u(t) + s̺(t, q, u) + o(s),
¯p(t) = p(t) + sς(t, q, u) + o(s),

(71)



The functional (70) is said to be invariant under (71) if

where η ∈ C1(cid:0)R1+n+m, R(cid:1), ξ, ς ∈ C1(cid:0)R1+n+m, Rn(cid:1), ̺ ∈ C0(cid:0)R1+n+m, Rm(cid:1) are given functions.

ξτ (t) = ξ (t − τ, q(t − τ ), u(t − τ )).

Deﬁnition 32. A quantity C(t, q(t), q(t − τ ), u(t), u(t − τ ), p(t)), constant for t ∈ [t1, t2] along
any isoperimetric Pontryagin extremal with delay (q(·), u(·), p(·)) of problem (60)–(63), is said to
be an isoperimetric constant of motion with delay for (60)–(63).

Theorem 33 gives a Noether-type theorem for isoperimetric optimal control problems with time

delay.

Theorem 33 (Isoperimetric Noether symmetry theorem with time delay in Hamiltonian form).
If we have invariance in the sense of Deﬁnition 31, then

C(t, q(t), q(t − τ ), u(t), u(t − τ ), p(t)) = −p(t) · ξ (t, q(t), u(t))

+ H (t, q(t), u(t), q(t − τ ), u(t − τ ), p(t)) η (t, q(t), u(t))

(72)

is an isoperimetric constant of motion with delay (cf. Deﬁnition 32) for (60)–(63).

Proof. The constant of motion with delay (72) is obtained by applying Theorem 10 to problem
(70).

Remark 34. The constant of motion with time delay (72) has the same expression in the two
intervals t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ and t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2.

Remark 35. For the isoperimetric problem of the calculus of variations (1)–(3), the Hamiltonian
(69) takes the form H = L + p · u, with u = ˙q and p(t) = −∂3L[q]τ (t) − ∂5L[q]τ (t + τ ). In this case
the isoperimetric constant of motion with delay (72) reduces to (14) in the interval t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ
and to (15) in the interval t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2 with Φ ≡ 0 .

Corollary 36. (Isoperimetric Noether’s theorem for problems of the calculus of variations with
second-order derivatives) For the second-order problem of the calculus of variations (64), the
isoperimetric constant of motion with delay (72) is equivalent to

τ (t) · (ξ1 − ¨qτ )

(73)

(74)

for t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2

Proof. For simplicity, we only prove the corollary in the interval t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2 . For the problem
of the calculus of variations with second-order derivatives, one has

H(cid:0)t, q0(t), q1(t), u(t), q0(t − τ ), q1(t − τ ), u(t − τ ), p0, p1(cid:1)

= F (t, q0, q1, u, q0(t − τ ), q1(t − τ ), u(t − τ )) + p0q1 + p1u ,

and




q0(t) = q(t)
q1(t) = ˙q(t)
u(t) = ¨q(t)
q0(t − τ ) = q(t − τ )
q1(t − τ ) = ˙q(t − τ )
u(t − τ ) = ¨q(t − τ )

17

Using these equalities, it follows from the isoperimetric Pontryagin Maximum Principle (The-

orem 29) that

∂H

= 0 ⇔ p1 =

∂F
∂ ¨q

˙p1 = −

In this case, the constant of motion (72) takes the form

C = Hτ − p0 · ξ0 − p1 · ξ1 ,

and substituting H, p0 and p1 by its expressions, the intended result is obtained.

Remark 37. We can easily verify that for m = 2 the quantities (73) and (74) coincide with (56)
and (57), respectively, in the case Φ ≡ 0 .

Illustrative examples

In this section we consider two examples where the isoperimetric problems do not depend explicitly
on the independent variable t (autonomous case).

Example 38. Consider the second-order isoperimetric problem of the calculus of variations with
time delay

J 2

1 [q(·)] =Z 2

0

(¨q(t) + ¨q(t − 1))2 dt −→ min,

q(t) = −t4 , − 1 ≤ t ≤ 0,

˙q(2) = −32,

q(2) = −14,

(75)

(76)

(77)

subject to isoperimetric equality constraints

I 1[q(·)] =Z 2

0

( ˙q + ˙q(t − 1))2 dt = l

in the class of functions q(·) ∈ Lip ([−1, 2]; R). For this example, the augmented Lagrangian F is
given as

F = (¨q(t) + ¨q(t − τ ))2 − λ ( ˙q + ˙q(t − 1))2 .

From Corollary 17 with m = 2, one obtains that any solution to problem (75)-(76) must satisfy

2q(iv)(t) + q(iv)(t − 1) + q(iv)(t + 1) + 2λ (¨q(t) + ¨q(t − 1) + ¨q(t + 1)) = 0,

0 ≤ t ≤ 1,

q(iv)(t) + q(iv)(t − 1) + λ (¨q(t) + ¨q(t − 1)) = 0,

1 ≤ t ≤ 2 .

(78)

(79)

Because problem (75)–(76) is autonomous, we have invariance, in the sense of Deﬁnition 21, with
η ≡ 1 and ξ ≡ 0. Simple calculations show that isoperimetric Noether’s constant of motion with
time delay (73)–(74) coincides with the DuBois–Reymond condition (37)–(38) with m = 2:

(¨q(t) + ¨q(t − τ ))2 − λ ( ˙q + ˙q(t − 1))2

+ 2 ˙q(t)hλ (2 ˙q(t) + ˙q(t − 1) + ˙q(t + 1)) + 2q(iii)(t) + q(iii)(t − 1) + q(iii)(t + 1)i

− 2¨q(t) (2¨q(t) + ¨q(t − 1) + ¨q(t + 1)) = c1,

0 ≤ t ≤ 1,

(¨q(t) + ¨q(t − τ ))2 − λ ( ˙q + ˙q(t − 1))2 + 2 ˙q(t)hλ ( ˙q(t) + ˙q(t − 1))) + q(iii)(t) + q(iii)(t − 1)i

− 2¨q(t) (¨q(t) + ¨q(t − 1)) = c2,

1 ≤ t ≤ 2,

(80)

(81)

18

where c1 and c2 are constants.

One can easily check that function q(·) ∈ Lip ([−1, 2]; Rn) deﬁned by

−t4
t4
−t4 + 2

for − 1 < t ≤ 0
for 0 < t ≤ 1
for 1 < t ≤ 2

(82)

q(t) =

is an isoperimetric Euler–Lagrange extremal, i.e., satisﬁes (78)–(79) and is also a isoperimetric
DuBois–Reymond extremal, i.e., satisﬁes (80)–(81). Corollary 36 asserts the validity of Noether’s
constant of motion, which is here veriﬁed: (73)–(74) holds along (82) with η ≡ 1, and ξ ≡ 0.

Example 39. Let us consider an isoperimetric autonomous optimal control problem with time
delay, i.e., the situation when L, ϕ and g in (60)–(62) do not depend explicitly on t. In this case
one has invariance, in the sense of Deﬁnition 31, for η ≡ 1 and ξ = ̺ = ς ≡ 0. It follows from
Theorem 33 that

H (q(t), u(t), q(t − τ ), u(t − τ ), p(t)) = constant

along any isoperimetric Pontryagin extremal with delay (q(·), u(·), p(·)) of the problem.
language of mechanics (83) is called conservation of energy.
