Abstract

Linear and nonlinear ion-acoustic waves are studied in a ﬂuid model for non-relativistic, unmag-

netized quantum plasma with electrons with an arbitrary degeneracy degree. The equation of state

for electrons follows from a local Fermi-Dirac distribution function and apply equally well both to

fully degenerate or classical, non-degenerate limits. Ions are assumed to be cold. Quantum diﬀrac-

tion eﬀects through the Bohm potential are also taken into account. A general coupling parameter

valid for dilute and dense plasmas is proposed. The linear dispersion relation of the ion-acoustic

waves is obtained and the ion-acoustic speed is discussed for the limiting cases of extremely dense

or dilute systems.

In the long wavelength limit the results agree with quantum kinetic theory.

Using the reductive perturbation method, the appropriate Korteweg-de Vries equation for weakly

nonlinear solutions is obtained and the corresponding soliton propagation is analyzed. It is found

that soliton hump and dip structures are formed depending on the value of the quantum parameter

for the degenerate electrons, which aﬀect the phase velocities in the dispersive medium.

INTRODUCTION

The study of degenerate plasma is important due to its applications e.g. to strong laser

produced plasmas [1], high density astrophysical plasmas such as in white dwarfs or neutron

stars [2], or large density electronic devices (as in the drain region of n+nn+ diodes [3]). In

plasmas, the quantum eﬀects are more relevant for electrons rather than ions because of their

lower mass. The quantum nature of the charge carriers manifests with the inclusion of both

Pauli exclusion principle for fermions and Heisenberg uncertainty principle due to the wave

like character of the particles. Accordingly, electrons obey the Fermi-Dirac statistics and

their equation of state is determined using the Fermi-Dirac distribution. On the other hand

the quantum diﬀraction eﬀects are usually modeled by means of quantum recoil terms in

kinetic theory or the Bohm potential in ﬂuid theory, besides higher order gradient corrections

[4, 5].

Accordingly, the wave propagation in a degenerate plasma can be studied using at least

two main approaches i.e., kinetic and hydrodynamic models. In kinetic theory, the unper-

turbed electron distribution is frequently given by a Fermi-Dirac function, while in hydrody-

namics the momentum equation for electrons is made consistent with the equation of state

of a degenerate electron Fermi gas [4, 5]. In ﬂuid models, the ion-sound wave propagation

in plasmas with degenerate electrons has been investigated by a number of authors [6–12],

using the equation of state for a cold (fully degenerate) Fermi electron gas, with a negligible

thermodynamic temperature. The energy distribution of a degenerate electron gas described

by the Fermi-Dirac distribution is characterized by independent parameters, one of which

is the chemical potential, while the other is the thermodynamic temperature. On the other

hand, the energy spread for the classical ideal electron gas obeying Maxwell-Boltzmann

distribution is uniquely determined by the thermodynamic temperature. The equation of

state for the fully degenerate electron gas so reduces to an one-parameter problem i.e., the

chemical potential. Therefore, it is of interest to study the linear and specially nonlinear

wave propagation in the intermediate regime, depending on the competition between the

two parameters i.e., chemical potential and thermal temperature [13], including quantum

diﬀraction.

Our treatment is specially relevant to borderline systems with T ≈ TF , which are neither
strongly degenerate nor suﬃciently well described by classical statistics, where T and TF are

2

resp. the electron thermodynamic and Fermi temperatures. A striking example is provided

by inertial conﬁnement fusion plasmas [14], with particle densities ranging from 1030m−3

to 1032m−3, and thermodynamic temperatures above 107K. During laser irradiation of the

solid target, quantum statistical eﬀects tend to be more relevant immediately after compres-

sion, before the heating phase. Moreover, laboratory simulation of astrophysical scenarios

involving dense plasmas better ﬁt the intermediate quantum-classical regime [15]. For these

reasons and potential applications on e.g. ultra-small semiconductor devices operating in a

mixed dense-dilute regime [3], it is desirable to have a general macroscopic model covering

both classical and quantum statistics, besides quantum diﬀraction.

Previously, Maafa [16] studied the ion-acoustic and Langmuir waves in a plasma with ar-

bitrary degeneracy of electrons using classical kinetic theory, linearizing the Vlasov-Poisson

system around a Fermi-Dirac equilibrium. Using quantum kinetic theory, Melrose and Mush-

taq derived the electron-ion plasma low-frequency longitudinal response including quantum

recoil, ﬁrst for dilute (Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium) plasmas [18] and then [19] for gen-

eral degeneracy, in a Fermi-Dirac equilibrium. These works were restricted to linear waves

only. Eliasson and Shukla [20] derived nonlinear quantum electron ﬂuid equations by taking

the moments of the evolution equation for the Wigner function in terms of a local Fermi-

Dirac equilibrium with an arbitrary thermodynamic temperature. In this model quantum

diﬀraction manifest in terms of the Bohm potential. The high (classical) as well as the

low (degenerate) temperature limits of the obtained ﬂuid equations were also discussed in

connection to Langmuir waves. Recently Dubinov et al.

[21] investigated the nonlinear

theory of ion-acoustic waves in isothermal plasmas with arbitrary degeneracy, but without

including quantum recoil. They presented the equation of state for ions and electrons by
considering them as warm (T 6= 0) Fermi gases. The nonlinear analysis was done using
a Bernoulli pseudo-potential approach. The ranges of the phase velocities of the periodic

ion-acoustic waves and the soliton velocity were investigated. However, for simplicity they

ignored the quantum Bohm potential, which increases the order of the resulting dynami-

cal equations. Our central issue here is to analyze the combined quantum statistical and

quantum diﬀraction eﬀects on linear and nonlinear ion-acoustic structures in plasmas, in an

analytically simple (but hopefully not simplistic) approach.

The manuscript is organized in the following way. In Section II, the basic set of hydro-

dynamic equations is proposed and the barotropic equation of state deﬁned, for a general

3

Fermi-Dirac equilibrium.

In Section III, the linear dispersion relation for quantum ion-

acoustic waves is derived, following the ﬂuid model. Comparison with known results from

quantum kinetic theory allows to determine a ﬁtting parameter in the quantum force, so

that the macroscopic and microscopic approaches coincide in the long wavelength limit. In

Section IV, nonlinear wave structures are studied by means of the reductive perturbation

method and the associated Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. The associated quantum

soliton solution is obtained. Section V studies the possibility of forward and backward

propagating solitons in real systems. Finally, Section VI collect some conclusions.

II. MODEL EQUATIONS

In order to study ion-acoustic waves in unmagnetized electron-ion plasmas with arbitrary

electron temperature, we use the set of dynamic equations described as follows [4].

The ion continuity and momentum equations are respectively given by

The Poisson equation is written as

∂2φ
∂x2 =

e
ε0

(ne − ni) ,

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

where φ is the electrostatic potential. The ion ﬂuid density and velocity are represented

by ni and ui respectively, while ne is the electron ﬂuid density. Also, me and mi are the
electron and ion masses, −e is the electronic charge, ε0 the vacuum permittivity and  the
reduced Planck constant. In Eq. (3), α is a dimensionless constant factor to be determined

and p = p(ne) is the electron’s ﬂuid scalar pressure, to be speciﬁed by a barotropic equation

of state obtained in the continuation.

The last term proportional to 2 on the right hand side of the momentum equation for

electrons is the quantum force, which arises due to the quantum Bohm potential, responsible

for quantum diﬀraction or quantum tunneling eﬀects due to the wave like nature of the

4

electrons. The dimensionless quantity α will be selected in order to exactly ﬁt the kinetic

theory linear dispersion relation in a three-dimensional Fermi-Dirac equilibrium, as detailed

in Section III. It is known that the qualitative role of the Bohm potential is to provide

extra dispersion. However, the precise numerical coeﬃcient in its deﬁnition is a debatable

subject involving e.g. the dimensionality and the temperature [22]. For instance, for a local

Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium, Gardner [23] has found a factor α = 1. Frequently, the

factor α is set in order to ﬁt numerical results from kinetic theory [24], which is in the spirit

of the present work. On the other hand, quantum eﬀects on ions are ignored in the model

in view of their large mass. For simplicity, ion temperature eﬀects are also disregarded.

In order to derive the equation of state, consider a local quasi-equilibrium Fermi-Dirac

particle distribution function f = f (v, r, t) for electrons [25], given by

f (v, r, t) =

A

1 + eβ(ε−µ) ,

(5)

where β = 1/(κBT ), ε = mev2/2, v = |v| and µ is the chemical potential regarded as a
function of position r and time t. Besides, κB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the (constant)

thermodynamic electron’s temperature and v is the velocity. In addition, A is chosen to

ensure the normalization R f d3v = ne, so that

A = −

2π(cid:17)3

,

(6)

the last equality following from the Pauli principle (the factor two is due to the electron’s

spin). Therefore, in the ﬂuid description, µ and A are supposed to be slowly varying functions

of space and time. Equation (6) contains the poly-logarithm function Liν(η) of index ν, which

can be generically deﬁned [26] by

Liν(η) =

1

Γ(ν)Z ∞

0

sν−1
es/η − 1

ds ,

(7)

where Γ(ν) is the Gamma function. We also observe that a three-dimensional equilibrium is

assumed, although for electrostatic wave propagation only one spatial variable x is needed

in the model equations.

The scalar pressure follows from the standard deﬁnition for an equilibrium with zero drift

velocity,

yielding

p =

.

(9)

It is worth to consider some limiting cases of the barotropic equation of state. From Eq.
(9), in the dilute plasma limit case with a local fugacity eβµ ≪ 1 and using Liν(−eβµ) ≈ −eβµ,
one has

p = nekBT ,

(10)

which is the classical isothermal equation of state.

On the opposite, dense limit with a large local fugacity eβµ ≫ 1, from Liν(−eβµ) ≈

− (βµ)ν /Γ(ν + 1) the result is

p =

2
5

n0εF (cid:18) ne

n0(cid:19)5/3

,

(11)

which is the equation of state for a three-dimensional completely degenerate Fermi gas,

expressed in terms of the equilibrium number density n0. In Eq. (11), the electron’s Fermi
energy is εF = κBTF = [2/(2me)] (3π2n0)2/3, which is the same as the equilibrium chemical

potential in the fully degenerate case. In addition, n0 is the equilibrium electron (and ion)

number density.

The present treatment has similarities, as well as some diﬀerent choices, in comparison

to Eliasson and Shukla work [20]. In this article, also a local quasi-equilibrium Fermi-Dirac

distribution function was employed. However, presently a non-constant chemical potential

is admitted. In addition, in Ref. [20] the focus was on situations involving one-dimensional

laser-plasma compression experiments, while here it is assumed a three-dimensional isotropic

equilibrium. Finally, the present work deals with low-frequency (ion-acoustic) instead of

high-frequency (Langmuir) waves.

In passing, from Eq. (6) one deduce the useful relation

Li3/2(−eβµ)
Li3/2(−eβµ0)
where µ0 is the equilibrium chemical potential, satisfying

ne = n0

(13)

Using the equation of state (9), the chain rule and the property dLiν(η)/dη =

containing the minimal number of poly-logarithmic functions with a non-constant argument.

It is worth noticing that the model does not include collisional damping, which is rea-
sonable if the average electrostatic potential per particle hUi is much smaller than the
corresponding average kinetic energy hKi. For any degree of degeneracy, one can estimate
hUi ≈ e2/(4πε0rS), where the Wigner-Seitz ratio rS is deﬁned by (4πr3
S/3) n0 = 1. On the
other hand, from hKi = [me/(2ne)]R f v2d3v and evaluating on equilibrium, one derive the

general coupling parameter

covering both degenerate and non-degenerate systems, in the non-relativistic regime. In the

last equality in Eq. (16) it was used the expression (13) of the equilibrium density in terms

of the equilibrium fugacity z = eβµ0 and the temperature T . In the dilute case, it follows
from the properties of the poly-logarithm function that g ∝ hUi/(κBT ), while in the dense
case g ∝ hUi/εF , with µ0 ≈ εF .

For both dilute or dense plasmas, the condition for low collisionality is that the interaction
energy should be small in comparison to the kinetic energy, or g ≪ 1 [27]. Using Eq. (16),
the minimal temperature Tm for low collisionality (g < 1, relaxing the inequality sign) for

both dilute and dense regimes follows from

The result is shown in Fig.
(1), where T > Tm is equivalent to g < 1. Starting from
z ≈ 0 and increasing the density, larger temperatures are needed for ideality, until reaching
z = 9.8, T = 8.5 × 104K, corresponding to n0 = 2.9 × 1029m−3. For z > 9.8, smaller
temperatures are admitted, due to the Pauli blocking eﬀect inhibiting collisions.

[28] employed the

arithmetic sum of the thermal and Fermi energies, but in Eq. (19) we set some numerical

factors to have agreement with the exact form in the dilute and ultra-dense cases where one
has resp. hKi ≈ 3 κBT /2 and hKi ≈ 3 εF /5. In fact, using Eq. (13) expressing the density
in terms of the fugacity and the temperature, as well as the expression of the Fermi energy,

one ﬁnd

On the same spirit one can deﬁne a general electron thermal velocity (in the sense of

spreading of velocities) as vT ≡p2hKi/me, which is found from Eq. (18),

In the dilute case one has vT ≈p3κBT /me, while in the dense case vT ≈p(6/5) εF /me.

For non-degenerate ions in strongly coupled plasma, the ion crystallization eﬀects [29, 30]

that appear due to viscoelasticity of the ion ﬂuid in the ion momentum equation and cause

damping of the ion-acoustic wave are ignored under the assumptions (in three-dimensional
version) τm << ωpi and ∂ui/∂t >> (η/ρi)∇2ui +(1/ρi) (ζ + η/3)∇ (∇ · ui), where ρi =
nimi is the ion mass density, τm is the viscoelastic relaxation time or memory function for

ions, η is the shear and ζ are the bulk ion viscosity coeﬃcients, respectively.

III. LINEAR WAVES

A. Fluid theory

We linearize the system given by equations (1)-(15) by considering the ﬁrst order pertur-

bations (with a subscript 1) relative to the equilibrium, as follows,

ni = n0 + ni1 , ne = n0 + ne1 ,

ui = ui1 ,

φ = φ1 , µ = µ0 + µ1 .

(21)

The dispersion relation is obtained assuming plane wave excitations ∼ exp[i(kx − ωt)],

plays the role of a generalized ion-acoustic speed and ωpi =pn0e2/(miε0) is the ion plasma
In the long wavelength limit α 2k4/(12memi) ≪ c2

pi it follows from Eq.(22)
that ω2 ≈ c2
sk2. In the dilute case with a small fugacity eβµ0 ≪ 1 the well-known classical
result cs ≈ csc ≡ pκBT /mi is veriﬁed. In the opposite, extremely degenerate case where
the fugacity eβµ0 ≫ 1 one ﬁnd cs ≈ p(2/3)εF /mi, which is the ion-acoustic velocity for

a three-dimensional ultra-dense plasma [16]. Finally, the very short wavelength limit of

sk2 ≪ ω2

the dispersion relation gives ion oscillations such that ω = ωpi, both in the classical or

quantum situations. This happens because the ions are no longer shielded by electrons when

wavelength is comparable to or smaller than the electron shielding length. It is interesting

to note that taking the square root of both sides of Eq.(22) is identical to Eq.(4.5) in Ref.[17]

for the completely degenerate plasma case i.e., for α = 1/3.

Using Eq. (23), the ion-acoustic speed cs normalized to the purely classical expression csc

against z = eβµ0 is shown in Fig.(3). It can be seen that as the value of z increases (i.e. the

degeneracy of electrons and plasma density increase) the ion-acoustic speed also increases.

B. Kinetic theory

To endorse the macroscopic modeling, and to set the value of the parameter α in front of

the quantum force, it is useful to compare with the microscopic (quantum kinetic) results.

Considering the Wigner-Poisson system [4] involving a cold ionic species and electrons, it is

straightforward to derive the linear dispersion relation

The longitudinal response of an electron-ion plasma in a Fermi-Dirac equilibrium

f0(v) =

A

1 + eβ(ε−µ0)

(25)

has been calculated in [19], where A and µ0 are obtained from Eq. (13). Including the ﬁrst

order correction from quantum recoil, the result is

which follows from Eq. (29) of [19], in a diﬀerent notation. The ﬁrst and second terms in the

right-hand side of Eq.(26) are, respectively, the ionic and electronic responses of the plasma.

11

For the treatment of low-frequency waves, for simplicity it is suﬃcient to consider the
static electronic response, so that we set ω ≈ 0 in the last term of Eq. (26). From inspection,
and since we want to retain the ﬁrst order quantum correction, this approximation requires
ω2 ≪ 2k4/(12 m2

(28)

The combined low-frequency and long wavelength requirement (28) is more easily worked
out in the dilute (eβµ0 ≪ 1) and fully degenerate (eβµ0 ≫ 1) cases. For hydrogen plasma
and using the appropriate asymptotic expansions of the poly-logarithm functions, one ﬁnd
n0/T 2 ≫ 3.5×1016 m−3K −2 in the non-degenerate situation, and n0 ≪ 4.5×1037 m−3 for very
dense systems. It is seen that non-degenerate plasmas satisfy (28) more easily in denser and

colder plasmas, while fully degenerate plasmas safely ﬁt the assumptions, except for extreme

densities (e.g neutron star), which would deserve a relativistic treatment. Otherwise, there

would be the need to retain the full electronic response in Eq.(26). As a consequence, a

somewhat more involved dispersion relation would be found.

In fact, using n0 from Eq.

(13), it can be shown that the necessary condition (28) is safely attended for all fugacities,
as far as T ≪ 109 K, which is reasonable in view of the non-relativistic assumption.
Dropping ω in the electronic response, Eq. (26) considerably simplify, reducing to

which is our ultimate choice. Therefore, to comply with the results of kinetic theory on

quantum ion-acoustic waves in a three-dimensional Fermi-Dirac equilibrium, the numerical

coeﬃcient in the quantum force has to be a function of the fugacity. In particular, with
z = exp(βµ0), we have α → 1 for z → 0 and α → 1/3 as z → ∞. Moreover, as seen in
Fig. (4), the coeﬃcient α is a monotonically decreasing function of the fugacity, showing
that the quantum force becomes less eﬀective in denser systems. The result α → 1 for
non-degenerate systems agrees with the quantum hydrodynamic model for semiconductor
devices derived in [23], while α → 1/3 agrees with [31, 32] in the fully degenerate case. On
the other hand, high frequency waves such as quantum Langmuir waves would be correctly

described by a value α = 3, in order to reproduce the Bohm-Pines [33] dispersion relation

The detailed account of the collisionless damping of quantum ion-acoustic waves has

been considered in [19], where the damping rate is shown to be small, as long as the ion

temperature is much smaller than the electron temperature of the plasma.

IV. NONLINEAR WAVES

Having performed the analysis of linear quantum ion-acoustic waves, it is worth to con-

sider the nonlinear structures which are accessible through our hydrodynamic model.

From now on, it is useful to deﬁne the rescaling

H =

.

In the dilute or fully degenerate cases one has resp. H ≈ βωpe/√3 or H ≈ ωpe/(2εF ).

Moreover, from Eq.(12),

˜ne =

Li3/2(−eβµ)
Li3/2(−eβµ0)

.

(40)

In the following, for simplicity the tilde will be omitted in the normalized quantities.

In order to ﬁnd a nonlinear evolution equation, a stretching of the independent variables

x, t is deﬁned as follows [6, 12],

ξ = ε1/2(x − V0t) ,

τ = ε3/2t,

where ε is a small parameter and V0 is the phase velocity of the wave to be determined later

14

on. The perturbed quantities can be expanded in powers of ε,

ni = 1 + εni1 + ε2ni2 + . . . ,

ne = 1 + εne1 + ε2ne2 + . . . ,

ui = εui1 + ε2ui2 + . . . ,

Φ = εΦ1 + ε2Φ2 + . . . ,

µ = µ0 + εµ1 + ε2µ2 + . . .

The lowest order equations give

and

ni1 = ui1 = ne1 = Φ1 ,

V0 = ±1 ,

(41)

(42)

(43)

which is the normalized phase velocity of the ion-acoustic wave in plasmas with arbitrary

degeneracy of electrons. From now on, we set V0 = 1 without loss of generality.

Now collecting the next higher order terms, we have

Using the next higher order Poisson’s equation together with Eqs. (42), (44) and (45) yield

H 2

4 (cid:19) .

(46)

(47)

In the fully classical limit (non-degeneracy and no Bohm potential), one has a = 1, b = 1/2,

recovering the KdV equation for classical ion-acoustic waves [34]. The eﬀect of arbitrary

degeneracy of electrons appears in both the nonlinear and dispersive coeﬃcients in the KdV

equation (46).

15

It is easy to derive traveling wave solutions for the problem. One of them is the one-soliton

solution of the KdV equation (46) given by

Φ1 = D sech2(

η
W

) ,

(48)

where D = 3u0/a and W = p4b/u0 are resp. the height and width of the soliton. The
polarity of the soliton depends on the sign of D. In the co-moving frame one has η = ξ−u0τ ,
where u0 is the speed of the nonlinear structure. Decaying boundary conditions in the

co-moving system were used. For a given perturbation speed, one conclude that larger

degeneracy (larger a, b) gives a smaller scaled amplitude and a larger scaled width. This

is because it becomes harder to accommodate more fermions in a localized wave packet

under strong degeneracy. The transformed coordinate η can be written as η = ε1/2 ˜η where
˜η = x − V t and V = V0 + εu0 is the soliton velocity in the lab frame.

It can be seen from the relation (47) that the dispersive coeﬃcient b disappears at H =

2.

In principle, the lack of a dispersive term eventually yields the formation of a shock.

However, actually in this case a dispersive contribution could be obtained from a higher-

order perturbation theory, as occurs in the Kawahara equation [35]. In the present context
of quantum ion-acoustic nonlinear waves, the soliton solution can exist only for H 6= 2, with
a proper balance between dispersion and nonlinearity. Notice that for H < 2 the soliton

velocity is positive i.e., u0 > 0 (which means V > V0 and it moves with supersonic speed)

and we have a hump (bright) soliton structure since a > 0 and D > 0. However, for H > 2

case the dispersive coeﬃcient becomes negative i.e., b < 0, so that the soliton solution will

exist only if u0 < 0 (i.e., V < V0 soliton moves with subsonic speed), since the width W

should have real values. As u0 is negative in the H > 2 case, the nonlinearity coeﬃcient

remains positive i.e., a > 0, therefore D < 0 which gives a dip (or dark) soliton instead of a

hump (or bright) structure [36]. In brief, the model predicts hump solitons for H < 2 case

and dip solitons for H > 2. Finally, in the special ﬁne tuning case with H = 2 there is a

shock instead of solitonic solutions, at least within the present order of perturbation theory.

V. ON BRIGHT AND DARK PROPAGATING SOLITONS

The qualitative diﬀerences of quantum ion-acoustic soliton propagation for H < 2 or

H > 2 deserve a closer examination about the associated physical conditions. First, the

16

quantum parameter in Eq. (39) can be re-expressed according to

H 2 = −

ε0

Li−1/2(−eβµ0) ,

(49)

where the equilibrium density in Eq. (13) was employed. From the last equation, one ﬁnd

that H > 2 occurs for suﬃciently small temperatures, or

κBT <

288π3(cid:18) e2

(cid:2)Li−1/2(−eβµ0)(cid:3)2

(50)

as illustrated in Fig. (5). Low temperature plasmas with T < 103K are therefore candidates
for the peculiar dark solitons. Starting from z = eβµ0 ≈ 0 the maximal temperature increases
until z = 3, T = 1.1×103K (corresponding to n0 = 3.0×1026m−3), when it starts to decrease.

FIG. 5: The temperatures for H > 2 satisfying Eq. (50) are below the curve, where z = eβµ0 .

As an example, in Figs.(6) and(7) the two classes of quantum ion-acoustic bright or dark

solitons are shown, following Eq. (48). The bright soliton (H < 2) moves with supersonic

speed while the dark soliton (H > 2) moves with subsonic speed.

On the other hand, it is interesting to examine the conditions for weak coupling as

deduced in the present theory. Combining the weak coupling condition yielding the minimal

temperature in Eq. (17) with Eq. (49) gives an upper bound on the quantum diﬀraction

parameter, or

H 2 < H 2

which is shown in Fig. (8).

It follows that large H > 2 values fall within the strongly

coupled regime where coupling parameter g for degenerate electrons may become near or

greater than one.

FIG. 6: Hump soliton structure for H < 2 is shown moving with supersonic speed in lab frame.

The soliton hump corresponds to T = 105K, z = 5, u0 = 0.1, ε = 0.1 for which H = 0.64,
n0 = 3.5 × 1029m−3, ωpe = 3.3 × 1016s−1, respectively.

FIG. 7: Dip soliton structure for H > 2 is shown moving with subsonic speed in lab frame. The
soliton dip is obtained at T = 103K, z = 5, u0 = −0.1, for which H = 2.03, n0 = 3.5 × 1026m−3,
ωpe = 1.1 × 1015s−1, respectively.

Nevertheless, considering ion-acoustic waves at least, a strong coupling between electrons

will be not the main aspect of the dynamics. Although the complete analysis of the strongly

coupled plasma regime is beyond the scope of this work, some conclusions can be found from

the simplest way to introduce non-ideality for electrons, namely the addition of a dissipation
term −ωcollue in the right-hand side of Eq. (3), where ue is the electron ﬂuid velocity and

ωcoll is the electron-electron collision frequency. Using the continuity equation for electrons
it is possible to estimate ωne1 ≈ k n0ue1, where ne1 and ue1 are the ﬁrst-order perturbations
of the electron ﬂuid density and velocity. Finally with ω ≈ csk one ﬁnds that the dissipation
term is negligible with respect to the pressure term provided ω ≫ (me/mi)ωcoll, which is
always satisﬁed within the inertialess electrons assumption. We note that according to the

Landau expression [37] one has in the non-degenerate case

ωcoll
ωpe ≈

ln Λ
Λ

,

(52)

where Λ ∼ 1/g3/2 is the plasma parameter. In the fully degenerate case the right-hand side
of Eq. (52) needs to be multiplied by the Pauli blocking factor κBT /εF . The conclusion is
that except for very high g ≫ 1 the electron-electron coupling can be neglected as long as
the inertialess assumption is valid.

VI. CONCLUSION

The linear and nonlinear ion-acoustic waves in a non-relativistic quantum plasma with

arbitrary degeneracy of electrons have been investigated. Besides degeneracy, the quantum

diﬀraction eﬀect of electrons was also included, in terms of the Bohm potential. The linear

dispersion relation for quantum ion-acoustic waves was found in terms of a generalized

ion-acoustic speed, valid for both the dilute and dense cases. The numerical factor α in

19

front of the quantum force in the macroscopic model was ﬁxed in order to comply with the

kinetic theory results. The corresponding KdV equation was obtained using the reductive

perturbation method. The possible classes of propagating solitons, namely bright for H < 2

moving with supersonic speed and dark for H > 2 case moving with subsonic speed were

discussed, where H is a measure of the strength of quantum diﬀraction eﬀects arising from

the Bohm potential. To conclude, the derivation covers both the basic quantum eﬀects in

plasmas (arising resp. from quantum statistics and wave-like behavior of the charge carriers),

in both the dilute and dense regimes. For instance, from Eq. (48) the scaled amplitude of

the soliton becomes smaller for larger degeneracy, with D = 3u0 for α = 1 (non-degenerate

case) and D = 9u0/4 for α = 1/3 (fully degenerate) case. The results are useful for the

understanding of ion-acoustic wave propagation in an unmagnetized quantum plasma with

arbitrary degeneracy of electrons.
