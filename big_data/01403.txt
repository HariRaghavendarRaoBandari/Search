1. Introduction

The study of slant submanifolds was started in 1990 by Chen [7] which is the generalization
of CR-submanifolds introduced by Bejancu [1]. The theory of slant submanifolds become very
rich area of research for geometers. Slant submanifolds were studied by diffrent geometers in
different ambient spaces. In 1994 Papaghiuc generalizes the slant submanifolds as semi-slant
submanifolds [10]. Carriazo introduced the idea of bi-slant submanifolds as generalization of
semi-slant submanifolds [2]. The hemi-slant submanifolds are one of the classes of bi-slant
submanifolds. The hemi-slant submanifolds were ﬁrst named as anti-slant submanifolds. In [4]
B. Sahin named these submanifolds as hemi-slant submanifolds, as anti-slant seems to refer no
slant factor. since then these submanifolds were studied in different kinds of structures.

In this paper, we ﬁrst collect some results and deﬁnitions for ready references in the pre-

manifolds. In fourth section we obtain some results on totally umbilical hemi-slant submani-
folds and in the last section we study cohomology class for hemi-slant submanifolds of nearly
Kaehler manifolds.

2. Preliminaries

Let f : N → N be an isometrical immersion of a Riemannian manifolds N into N . The

denote the Lie algebra of vector ﬁeld and set of all normal vector ﬁelds on N respectively. The
Levi-Civita connection on T N and T ⊥N is denoted by (cid:209)
. the Gauss and Weingarten
equation are give as

and (cid:209)

(cid:209) XY = (cid:209) XY + W (X ,Y ),

(cid:209) XV = −SV X + (cid:209) ⊥

(2)

for any X ,Y in T N and V in T ⊥N . Where W

is the second fundamental form and S is
the shape operator. The second fundamental form and the shape operator are related by the
following equation

g(W (X ,Y ),V ) = g(SV X ,Y ).

The mean curvature vector H on a submanifold N is given by the following relation

H =

(4)

where l denotes the dimension of submanifold N and {e1 , ..., el} is the local orthonormal
frame. The submanifold N is said to be a totally umbilical submanifold of a Riemannian
manifold N , if for the mean curvature vector H The following relation holds

W (X ,Y ) = g(X ,Y )H .

Using (5), the gauss and Weingarten equation takes the form

and

(cid:209) XY = (cid:209) XY + g(X ,Y )H ,

(cid:209) XV = −Xg(H ,V ) + (cid:209) ⊥

X V.

for X ,Y ∈ T N and V ∈ T ⊥N .

let PX and N X denotes the tangential and normal components of ((cid:209) X J)H then

PX = −Xg(H , J H ) − T Xg(H , H ) − t(cid:209) ⊥

A submanifold N is said to be totally geodesic if W (X ,Y ) = 0, for any X ,Y ∈ T N and if

H = 0, the submanifold N is minimal.

Now for a submanifold N of a Riemannian manifold N , we can write X ∈ T N as

JX = T X + NX ,

(10)

where PX and NX are the tangential and normal parts of JX respectively. In the same way, for
any V ∈ T ⊥N , we have

JV = tV + nV,

(11)

where tV and nV are tangential and normal components of JV . The covariant derivative of
tangential and normal parts of (10) and (11) is given as

((cid:209) X T )Y = (cid:209) XTY − T (cid:209) XY,

((cid:209) X N)Y = (cid:209) ⊥

X NY − N(cid:209) XY,

((cid:209) Xt)V = (cid:209) XtV − t(cid:209) ⊥

X V,

and

((cid:209) X f )V = (cid:209) ⊥

X fV − f (cid:209) ⊥

X V.

(13)

(14)

(15)

The manifold N with almost complex structure J and Riemannian metric g is said to be a

nearly Kaehler manifold if

((cid:209) X J)Y + ((cid:209) Y J)X = 0,

(16)

for any vector ﬁeld X ,Y in T N . The above condition is equivalent to the following equation

((cid:209) X J)X = 0,

for X in T N . For a nearly Kaehler manifold, we also have the following facts:

J2 = −I

and

g(JX , JY ) = g(X ,Y ),

(17)

(18)

for all vector ﬁeld X ,Y ∈ N .

We know that the Kaehler manifold is always a nearly Kaehler manifolds but converse is

not always true.

The covariant derivative of the complex structure J is deﬁned as

((cid:209) X J)Y = (cid:209) X JY − J(cid:209) XY,

(19)

or

(cid:209) X JX = J(cid:209) X X .

(20)

For a hemi-slant submanifold N of a nearly Kaehler manifold N . The following facts can
easily seen from [4]

and

T 2X = −cos2q X ,

g(T X , TY ) = cos2q g(X ,Y ),

g(NX , NY ) = sin2q g(X ,Y ),

(21)

(22)

(23)

for X ,Y ∈ Dq .
Let N be nearly Kaehler manifold and N be a submanifolds of N .

there are certain
important classes of submanifolds viz totally real submanifolds, holomorphic submanifolds and
CR-submanifolds as a generalization of totally real and holomorphic submanifolds. The CR-
submanifolds were generalized by Chen as slant submanifolds. The hemi-slant submanifolds
is a generalization of slant submanifolds.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let N be submanifold of nearly Kaehler manifold N , then N is said to be a
hemi-slant submanifold if there exist two orthogonal distributions Dq and D⊥ on N such that
(i) T N = Dq
(ii) Dq
is a slant distribution with slant angle q
(iii) D⊥ is a totally real, that is JD⊥ ⊆ T ⊥N ,

⊕ D⊥

p
2 ,

6=

it is clear from above that CR-submanifolds and slant submanifolds are hemi-slant subman-

ifolds with slant angle q =

p
2 and Dq = 0, respectively.

3. Hemi-slant submanifolds of nearly Kaehler manifolds

In this section, we study the integrability and the minimality of the distributions involved
in the deﬁnition. We try to prove some lemmas which are very important to prove for next two
sections.

Lemma 3.1. Let N be proper hemi-slant submanifold of nearly Kaehler manifold N . then
we have

Proof. For any X ∈ Dq and Z ∈ D⊥, using (10)

J(D⊥) ⊥ N(D

q

).

g(JX , JZ) = (T X + NX , JZ) = g(NX , JZ).

4

We know from (18)

which implies that

which shows that N(Dq

) ⊥ J(D⊥)

g(JX , JZ) = g(X , Z) = 0,

g(NX , JZ) = 0,

In the light of above lemma the normal bundle T ⊥N can be decomposed as

T ⊥N = J(D⊥) ⊕ N(D

q

) ⊕ m

,

(24)

where m

is the invariant distribution of T ⊥N with respect to J.

Lemma 3.2. Let N be proper hemi-slant submanifold of nearly Kaehler manifold N . then
we have

T D⊥ = {0}

and

T D

q

q

= D

.

(25)

Proof. The proof follow from (10), (18) and (21)trivially, so we omit the proof.

Theorem 3.3. Let N be a submanifold of nearly Kaehler manifold N , then for any X ,Y ∈
T N , we have the following

(cid:209) X TY − SNY X − T(cid:209) XY − 2tW (X ,Y) + (cid:209) Y T X − SNXY − T (cid:209) Y X = 0,

(26)

and

W (X , TY ) + (cid:209) ⊥

X NY − N(cid:209) XY − 2nW (X ,Y ) + W (Y, T X ) + (cid:209) ⊥

Y NX − N(cid:209) Y X = 0.

Proof. For a nearly Kaehler manifold, we know that

((cid:209) X J)Y + ((cid:209) Y J)X = 0,

which implies that

(cid:209) X JY − J(cid:209) XY + (cid:209) Y JX − J(cid:209) Y X = 0.

Using (1) and (10), we have

(cid:209) X TY + (cid:209) X NY − J(cid:209) XY − JW (X ,Y ) + (cid:209) Y T X + (cid:209) Y NX − J(cid:209) Y X − JW (Y, X ) = 0.

Using (1), (2), (10) and (11), we get

(cid:209) X TY + W (X , TY ) − SNY X + (cid:209) ⊥

+(cid:209) Y T X + W (Y, T X ) − SNXY + (cid:209) ⊥

X NY − T (cid:209) XY − N(cid:209) XY − tW (X ,Y) − nW (X ,Y )
Y NX − T(cid:209) Y X − N(cid:209) Y X − tW (Y, X ) − nW (Y, X ) = 0.

Comparing the tangential and normal components, we have the required results.

5

In the following theorem, we prove the integrability of of the slant distribution.

Theorem 3.4. Let N be hemi-slant submanifold of a nearly Kaehler manifold, then the slant
distribution Dq

is integrable if and only if

(cid:209) X TY + (cid:209) Y T X − SNXY − SNY X − 2T (cid:209) Y X − 2tW (X ,Y) ∈ D

q

,

(27)

.

for X ,Y ∈ Dq
Proof. We know that the slant distribution is integrable if and only [X ,Y ] ∈ Dq for any X ,Y ∈
Dq . On the other hand, we know from (25), that T Dq
if and
only if T [X ,Y ] ∈ Dq . From (26), we have

= Dq , which infer that [X ,Y ] ∈ Dq

(cid:209) X TY − SNY X − T(cid:209) XY − 2tW (X ,Y) + (cid:209) Y T X − SNXY − (cid:209) Y X = 0,

for any X ,Y ∈ Dq . From which we conclude that

T [X ,Y ] = (cid:209) X TY + (cid:209) Y T X − SNXY − SNY X − 2T(cid:209) Y X − 2tW (X ,Y).

Using (25) and from above equation, we obtain that T [X ,Y ] ∈ Dq

if and only if (27) satisﬁes.

Now we prove the integrability of the anti-invariant distribution

Theorem 3.5. Let N be a hemi-slant submanifold of nearly Kaehler manifold N the the
totally real distribution D⊥ is integrable if and only if

SNZW + SNW Z − 2T(cid:209) W Z − 2tW (Z ,W ) = 0.

for any Z ,W ∈ D⊥.

Proof. For Z ,W ∈ D⊥. Using (26), we have

(cid:209) ZTW − SNW Z − T(cid:209) ZW − 2tW (Z ,W ) + (cid:209) W T Z − SNZW − T(cid:209) W Z = 0.

Using (25), from above equation, we have

−SNW Z − T(cid:209) ZW − 2tW (Z ,W ) − SNZW − T(cid:209) W Z = 0,

from which we infer that

T [Z ,W ] = −SNZW − SNW Z − 2T(cid:209) W Z − 2tW (Z ,W ) = 0

Hence from above equation we obtain the result.

Next, we prove the minimality of the slant distribution Dq .

6

Lemma 3.6. Let N be hemi-slant submanifold of nearly Kaehler manifold N then the distri-
bution Dq

is minimal if and only if the normal bundle is parallel and

g(AJW Z + sec2q AJW Z , T X ) = 0,

for X ∈ Dq and W ∈ D⊥.
Proof. For X ∈ Dq and W ∈ D⊥, we have

g((cid:209) XX + (cid:209)

secq T X secq T X ,W ) = g((cid:209) XX ,W ) + g((cid:209)

secq T X secq T X ,W )

Using (1) and (2) and the lemma (3.2), we have

g((cid:209) X X + (cid:209)

secq T X secq T X ,W ) = g((cid:209) X JX , JW ) + sec2q g((cid:209) X JX , JW )

= g((cid:209) X T X , JW ) + g((cid:209) X NX , JW )

+sec2q g((cid:209) XT X , JW ) + sec2q g((cid:209) X NX , JW )

= g(AJW X , T X ) + g((cid:209) ⊥

X NX , JW )

+sec2q g(AJW X , T X ) + sec2q g((cid:209) ⊥

X NX , JW ),

Now using the parallel condition of normal bundle, we conclude that

g((cid:209) XX + (cid:209)

secq T X secq T X ,W ) = g(AJW Z + sec2q AJW Z , T X )

frow which we have the result.

4. Totally umbilical hemi-slant submanifolds

In the present section, we deal with the hemi-slant submanifolds of nearly cosymplectic
manifold. Throughout this section we treat N a totally umbilical hemi-slant submanifold of a
nearly Kaehler manifolds N

Theorem 4.1. Let N be a totally umbilical hemi-slant submanifolds of a nearly Kaehler man-
ifold N . Then one of the following statements is necessarily holds (i) H = 0 or (ii) H ⊥ JW
or (iii) dimD⊥ = 1 or (iv) N is proper hemi-slant submanifold.

Proof. We know that N is nearly Kaehler manifold. For any Z ,W ∈ D⊥, we have

Using (19) implies that

((cid:209) ZJ)W + ((cid:209) W J)Z = 0,

(cid:209) ZJW + J(cid:209) ZW + (cid:209) W JZ + J(cid:209) W Z = 0.

Using the equation ( 6) and (7), we obtain

−Zg(H , JW ) + (cid:209) ⊥

Z JW − J(cid:209) ZW − g(Z ,W )JH −W g(H , JZ)
W JZ − J(cid:209) W Z − g(W , Z)JH = 0.

+(cid:209) ⊥

7

Taking inner product with Z, we get

−g(Z , Z)g(H , JW ) − g(Z ,W )g(Z , JH ) − g(W , Z)g(H , JZ) − g(W , Z)g(Z , JH ) = 0,

from which we conclude that

g(Z ,W )g(Z , JH ) = kZk2g(W , JH ).

Interchange the role of Z and W , we have

g(W , Z)g(W , JH ) = kW k2g(Z , JH ).

From (28) and (29), we get

g(W , JH ) =

g(Z ,W )2
kZk2kW k2 g(W , JH ).
The solution of (30) hold with respect to the following cases:
(i) H = 0, then we say that N is totally geodesic submanifold,
(ii) H ⊥ JW , which implies that H ∈ m ,
(iii) X is parallel to W , then dimD⊥ = 1,
(iv) N is proper hemi-slant submanifold as H ∈ m

implies that Dq

6= 0.

(28)

(29)

(30)

Theorem 4.2. Let N be a totally umbilical proper hemi-slant submanifolds of a nearly Kaehler
manifold N such that H ∈ m and (cid:209) ⊥

, ThenN is totally geodesic in N ,

X H ∈ m

Proof. Since N is a nearly Kaehler manifold. For X ∈ T N , we have

(cid:209) X JX = J(cid:209) X X

(cid:209) X T X + (cid:209) X NX = J(cid:209) X X

Using (10) , we have

Using (6) and (7), we obtain

(cid:209) X T X + g(X , T X )H − Xg(H , NX ) + (cid:209) ⊥

X NX = T(cid:209) X X + N(cid:209) X X + g(X , X )JH

Taking the inner product of above equation with JH , we get

g((cid:209) ⊥

X NX , JH ) = g(N(cid:209) X X , JH ) + g(X , X )g(JH , JH )

or

g((cid:209) ⊥

X NX , JH ) = g(X , X )kH k2

(31)

Also for any X ∈ T M, we have

((cid:209) X J)H = (cid:209) X JH − J(cid:209) X H

8

using (7), we have

((cid:209) XJ)H = −Xg(H , JH ) + (cid:209) ⊥

X JH − JXg(H , H ) + J(cid:209) ⊥

X H

(32)

Let PX and N X denotes the tangential and normal components of ((cid:209) X J)H . Now taking the
inner product of (32), with NX, we get

g(N X , NX ) = g((cid:209) ⊥

X JH , NX ) − sin2q kH k2g(X , X )

or

g((cid:209) ⊥

X NX , JH ) = −sin2q kH k2g(X , X ) − g(N X , NX )

From (31) and (33), we have

cos2q kH k2g(X , X ) + g(N X , NX ) = 0

from (9), we have

g(N X , NX ) = sin2q g(X , X )kH k2

Thus from (9),(34) and (36) we have

g(X , X )kH k2 = 0

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

Since N is totally umbilical proper hemi-slant submanifolds. Hence from (36), we conclude
that N is totally geodesic in N .

5. Cohomology of Hemi-slant submanifolds of nearly Kaehler manifold

In this section we study the de Rham cohomology class for a closed hemi-slant submanifold

in a nearly Kaehler manifold.

Let {e1 , ..., el , secq Te1 , ..., secq Tel , E1 , ..., Em, JE1 , ..., JEm} be the local orthonormal frame
} be the dual frame of one forms, then for any

v m∗

w 1∗

w m

v 1

on N and {w 1
Z ∈ D⊥, we have

w

l∗

and

w

i(Z) = 0,

w

i(e j) = d i
j

for

i, j = 1, 2, ..., 2l

w

i∗

(Je j) = d i

j , i∗ = l + j, ..., 2l , j = 1, ..., m

where el+ j = secq Te j. Then

w = w 1 ∧ ... ∧ w 2l

(37)

then w deﬁnes the 2l-form on N and is globally deﬁned on N .

Now we are able to prove the main result of this section.

9

Theorem 5.1. Let N be a closed hemi-slant submanifold of a nearly Kaehler manifold N . If
the normal bundle is parallel and

g(AJW X + sec2q AJW X , T X ) = 0,

for X ∈ Dq and Z ∈ D⊥ then the 2l-form w deﬁnes a de Rham cohomology class [w ] in
H2l(M ,
is integrable then the cohomology class is non-
trivial.

R). Now, if D⊥ is minimal and Dq

Proof. From (37), we have

2l

dw =

(−1)iw 1 ∧ ... ∧ ... ∧ w 2l

.

i=1

suppose w deﬁnes a cohomology class [w ] ∈ H2l(M ,

R). Now dw = 0, if and only if

dw (Z ,W , X1 , ..., X2l−1) = 0

(38)

(39)

and

dw (Z , X1 , ..., X2l) = 0

(40)
for Z ,W ∈ D⊥ and X1 , ..., X2l ∈ Dq . Thus (39) holds if and only if [Z ,W ] ∈ D⊥, which is the
condition of integrability of D⊥, which holds because of the theorem 3.5. The equation (40)
satisﬁes if and only if Dq
is minimal distribution, which holds due to the lemma 3.7. Hence w
is a closed form on N and deﬁnes a cohomology class given by [w ] ∈ H2l(M ,

R).

Now suppose Dq

and dual frame of D⊥, we can show that v
which shows that N is harmonic 2l-form. As D 6= 0 shows that w
is non-trivial in H2l(M ,

is integrable and D⊥ is minimal. By using similar arguments for the frame
is closed. since w and v are closed, we get dw = 0,
6= o, the cohomology class

R). which completes the proof.
