Abstract: Recent LHC data show hints of a new resonance in the diphoton distribution
at an invariant mass of 750 GeV. Interestingly, this new particle might be both CP odd and
play the role of a portal into the dark matter sector. Under these assumptions and motivated
by the fact that the requirement of SU (2)L invariance automatically implies the coupling of
this alleged new resonance to ZZ and Zγ, we investigate the current and future constraints
coming from the indirect searches performed through the neutrino telescope IceCube. We
show that these constraints can be stronger than the ones from direct detection experiments
if the dark matter mass is larger than a few hundred GeV. Furthermore, in the scenario in
which the dark matter is a scalar particle, the IceCube data limit the cross section between
the DM and the proton to values close to the predicted ones for natural values of the
parameters.

Introduction

The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have recently announced [1, 2] (for a recent update
see Refs. [3, 4]) the observation of an excess of events in the search for two photons in the
ﬁnal state. The shape of the excess suggests the detection of a resonance at an invariant
mass of approximately 750 GeV, and preliminary analyses suggest a rather large value for
the width of the resonance, around 45 GeV (equivalent to 6% of its mass).

The statistical signiﬁcance of this observation is still far from conclusive. The ATLAS
collaboration, with 3.2 fb−1 of data, claims a statistical signiﬁcance of 3.9σ (or 2.3σ by tak-
ing into account the look-elsewhere eﬀect) with an excess of about 14 events, corresponding
to a cross section of about 10 ± 3 fb. The CMS collaboration partially supports this ob-
servation, with a weaker statistical signiﬁcance (local signiﬁcance of 2.9σ) due to a smaller
integrated luminosity of 2.6 fb−1, and with an estimated cross section of 6 ± 3 fb.

If the excess were conﬁrmed by the data collected in the continuation of the Run-
2 of the LHC experiments, this discovery would represent a historical cornerstone in the
investigation of fundamental interactions beyond the Standard Model (SM).

It is tempting, although speculative, to try to relate this hypothetical new particle to
the fact that about 30% of the energy density of the universe seems to be in the form
of Dark Matter (DM) particles. If the indication on the total width ΓP of the resonance
persists, then the possibility of a coupling of this new resonance to DM with a sizeable

branching ratio (BR) would gain stronger support, because it would be easier to obtain
such a large width in a simple, weakly coupled model.
In that case, a natural scenario
would be that P acts as a portal between the SM and DM [5–24]. Given that the mass
scale of the resonance is above the electroweak scale, it is reasonable to write an eﬀective
theory describing the interaction between P and the photon in an SU (2)L invariant way.
In this case, an interaction of P with photons automatically implies the existence of the
vertices P ZZ and P Zγ, with ﬁxed couplings (see Ref.
[25] for a Run-2 ATLAS analysis
analysis of Zγ ﬁnal states). This very general statement has important implications for
phenomenology, ﬁrst of all at LHC but also in DM searches, if indeed P acts as a portal
into the DM sector.

The observed decay channel into two photons already constrains the spin of the reso-
nance (which we denote by P ) by virtue of the Landau-Yang theorem [26, 27], forcing its
spin to be either 0 or 2.1 In this work, we focus on the possibility that P is a particle of
spin zero, which interacts with a DM particle charged under a Z2 symmetry that prevents
it from decaying and makes it a viable DM candidate. We consider the two cases of a Dirac
fermion χ and of a complex scalar φ. The discussion of the DM phenomenology of this
model is strongly aﬀected by the assumption on the CP properties of P . At the energy
scales involved at the LHC, the production cross section of P is basically independent of
whether P is a scalar or a pseudoscalar particle, whereas at low energies the two options
bring to diﬀerent non-relativistic eﬀective operators.

In the scalar case, the eﬀective operator for the interaction between DM and nuclei is
spin independent (SI), yielding strong bounds from direct detection (DD) experiments. If
however P is a pseudoscalar particle, then the low energy eﬀective interaction between DM
and a nucleus is spin dependent (SD). In this case, the exclusion reach of DD is much weaker
and has to be complemented with the constraints coming from indirect detection (ID),
because the DM annihilation at low velocities occurs through an s-wave for the pseudoscalar
case (while in the scalar case it occurs through a p-wave process).

In this paper we assume that the particle P is a pseudoscalar2 and assess the constraints
coming from the IceCube (IC) experiment [33], a neutrino telescope that can be used to
study the DM annihilations occurring in the Sun [34, 35]. DM particles can get captured
in the gravitational well of the Sun if they scatter with atomic nuclei inside it and they lose
some energy. The accumulation of DM particles is partly compensated by their annihilation,
until the DM density in the Sun reaches an equilibrium level. If this is already achieved
today, then one can directly relate the annihilation rate to the capture rate in the Sun and
constrain the interactions of the DM with the 750 GeV resonance as well as the interactions
of the resonance with the SM particles.

The following features make particularly interesting the study of the 750 GeV resonance

with the IC experiment, if the pseudoscalar P acts like a portal to DM:

1Consequences of the Landau-Yang theorem can be evaded in scenarios in which a vectorial resonance
decays via a cascade into a ﬁnal state of three photons, two of which are too collimated to be discriminated
in the detector (see e.g. Ref. [28]). For a discussion about the fate of Landau-Yang theorem in non-Abelian
gauge theories, see [29].

2See Refs. [30–32] for a discussion of a pseudoscalar ﬁeld coupled to B(cid:101)B as a heavy hypercharge axion.

• The decay of P into ZZ and Zγ, granted by the assumption of SU (2)L invariance,
ensures the presence of at least two annihilation channels for DM that yield energetic
neutrinos which can be observed by IC.

• Given the assumption of equilibrium inside the Sun, neutrino ﬂuxes at Earth depend
only on the BR’s of DM annihilating into SM primary products. In the expression
of the BR’s, interesting simpliﬁcations occur and the bound from IC turns out to be
independent of the total width ΓP , of the coupling of P to the DM particle, and of
the mass mP of the resonance. Furthermore, the expressions of BR’s can be rewritten
as functions of the partial decay widths of P , which are the quantities that can be
directly measured via a resonant production at LHC.

• IC constraints reach the highest exclusion power for DM masses of order 10−1 to
1 TeV [34]. Indeed, for DM masses higher than a TeV, the DM number density in
the Sun is reduced and this, together with the fact that primary neutrinos from DM
annihilations hardly escape without interacting within the Sun and losing much of
their energy, deteriorates the limit. At lower DM masses, the angular resolution of
IC is poorer because of the lower number of Cherenkov photons produced by muons
at these energies.
Interestingly, this mass window coincides with the order of magnitude mP . Thus, if
the DM particle has a mass close to mP , IC might give the strongest bounds on DM.

This paper is structured as follows. Sec. 2 describes the diﬀerent models we consider, and
the benchmarks we choose for the couplings of P to SM particles which are consistent with
LHC observations. Sec. 3 illustrates the physics that links the observations of IceCube and
DM annihilations, and the importance of electroweak (EW) corrections at the energy scales
of interest to IC. Sec. 4 contains the results for the constraints from IceCube and DD on
the benchmark models we consider. Finally, in Sec. 5 we summarise our results.

2 The 750 GeV resonance as a portal to DM: the models

The observation of P in ﬁnal states with two photons forces P to be coupled at least
to the photon ﬁeld strength. According to our assumption, P is a pseudoscalar and the

eﬀective vertex for its interactions with photons must be of the form P Fµν(cid:101)Fµν in order not
to introduce a source of CP violation, where (cid:101)Fµν = 1
of excess in W W , ZZ and Zγ searches, the coupling of P to B(cid:101)B is favoured with respect
to a coupling to W i(cid:102)W i (where i = 1, 2, 3 is the SU (2)L index). Thus, for minimality, we
set to zero the coeﬃcient of the vertex P W i(cid:102)W i.3

Since the theory must have a cut-oﬀ at least higher than mP = 750 GeV, it is more than
reasonable to write down an explicitly SU (2)L-invariant Lagrangian. Given the current lack

2 εµνρσF ρσ is the dual ﬁeld strength.

3This can be easily realised in a UV completion where the eﬀective vertex between P and the vector

bosons arises via a fermion loop with fermions charged under U (1)Y and singlets under SU (2)L.

The absence of anomalies in the diphoton searches of Run-1 at LHC strongly favours
the hypothesis that P couples also to gluons4 and/or quarks, because the parton distribu-
tion function (PDF) for photons changes only mildly from 8 TeV to 13 TeV, whereas the
experimental results of Run 1 and 2 can be consistent if P is produced mainly by gluon
fusion or from heavy quarks (see for instance Ref.
[5]). We ignore the coupling of P to
leptons, since this is irrelevant for diphoton production and has a minor impact for IC and
DD. We consider therefore the following Lagrangian density

where Λ is the dimensionful scale of the eﬀective theory, a = 1, . . . , 8 is the gluon SU (3)c
index, i is the family index, H is the Higgs doublet and Hc = iσ2H∗ is its conjugate, Qi L
is the quark weak doublet, and cgg, cBB, yqP , yχP are real coeﬃcients.

As for the DM Lagrangian we envisage two possible (and mutually excluding) cases:
either the DM is a Dirac fermion χ (the results being analogous in case of a self-conjugate
DM particle)

LDM = χ(i /∂ − mχ)χ + yχP P χiγ5χ ,

or it is a scalar particle φ with CP-conserving Lagrangian

LDM = (∂µφ∗)(∂µφ) − m2

φ φ∗φ + P AP φ∗φ ,

where AP has to be thought of as a spurion ﬁeld which changes sign upon CP (for example
it might be the vacuum expectation value of some heavy parity-odd ﬁeld).

Notice that in both cases the DM could be identiﬁed with one of those particles in the
fermion or scalar multiplets coupled to the resonance and which, upon integrating them
out, give rise to the eﬀective interaction between P and photons and gluons. If so, the DM
must be of course a singlet under the SM gauge group.

In order to explain the diphoton excess and ensure that it can be consistent with Run-
1, we need at least cBB and one among cgg and yqP to be diﬀerent from zero.
In the
benchmark scenarios that we illustrate below we always assume a coupling of P both to
gluons and to light quarks. These allow respectively to improve the compatibility between
Run-1 and Run-2 of LHC (given the stronger increase of gluon PDF with energy with
respect to valence quarks), and to increase the elastic cross section between proton and
DM, in order to achieve more easily the equilibrium of DM number density in the Sun.

The coupling of P to B(cid:101)B induces partial decay widths of P to the ﬁnal states γγ, Zγ

and ZZ, proportional respectively to cos4 θW , 4 cos2 θW sin2 θW , sin4 θW , where θW is the
Weinberg angle. We stress again that the compulsory coupling of P to γγ automatically

interactions.

implies, when requiring SU (2)L invariance, a coupling of P to ZZ and Zγ that can give a
relevant signal for IC, given the typical hard spectrum of ν from Z decay.

We identify then three benchmark scenarios, where we always assume a coupling of P
to DM, gluons, photons (and hence ZZ and Zγ), a light quark (for simplicity we assume
that only yuP (cid:54)= 0, but the result would not diﬀer much if also ydP and ysP were present),
and possibly a heavy quark (top or bottom).

We choose the couplings cBB, cgg, yuP , ybP , ytP , and the coupling to DM in such a
way to satisfy three requirements: 1) the corresponding partial decay widths of P satisfy
the present collider bounds from Run-1 and explain the Run-2 diphoton excess [5], 2) the
capture rate of DM in the Sun due to elastic scattering with the proton is high enough so
that the DM number density in the Sun has reached equilibrium today, and 3) we obtain a
reasonable compatibility between γγ searches in Run-1 and Run-25.

The preliminary indication on the total decay width ΓP = 0.06 mP is included in most
of the bounds shown in Ref. [5]. As we will see in section 3, the IC bounds depend only
on the BR’s of χχ (or φφ) into SM particles. With the use of Eqs. (A.13) and (A.14) (or
(A.15) in the scalar DM case) one can rewrite the BR into, say, γγ, as follows, if P couples
for example to BB, gg and uu:

BR (DM DM → γγ) =

ΓZγ
Γγγ

ΓZZ
Γγγ

Γgg

+

Γuu
Γγγ

As stressed in appendix A, the dependence on ΓP and on the coupling of P to DM disappears
rendering the IC ﬂux predictions independent from both.

Even more importantly, the ratios of partial widths appearing in Eq. (2.4) are the
quantity directly constrained by LHC observations. Furthermore, the allowed ranges for
these ratios do not alter signiﬁcantly if one drops out the assumption ΓP = 0.06 mP (see
for example Figs. 1 and 2 of Ref. [5]).

We now illustrate the three benchmark scenarios we have chosen6.
(cid:5) Scenario A: P couples to B, g, u, χ. We choose the coeﬃcients of the model
leading to the partial decay widths of P into SM particles listed in table 1. The
production of P at LHC at 13 TeV occurs mainly from gluons, while at low energies
the elastic scattering with protons is mediated mainly by u. The resulting BR’s for
the annihilation of χχ into SM channels as a function of mχ are shown in Fig. 1.7
The relevant channels for the production of hard neutrinos are ZZ and Zγ.

(cid:5) Scenario B: P couples to B, g, u, χ and b. The chosen partial decay widths of
P are listed in table 2. The coupling of P to b quarks improves the compatibility
5We quantify this latter requirement by means of the gain factors deﬁned as the ratio r℘ between the
cross section for the process pp → P → γγ at 13 and 8 TeV, computed assuming that the resonance is
produced from a single parton ℘. Compatibility between Run-1 and Run-2 is achieved for r℘ ∼ 5, which
favours ℘ = g, b, s, c and disfavours ℘ = u, d, γ.

6For the rest of this section, for simplicity of notation we denote the DM particle by χ, but the discussion

is identical for the case of scalar DM.

7We do not show the BR for the process χχ → P P , where χ is exchanged in the t-channel, because the
result in terms of SM ﬁnal particles stays identical: the decay products of P P have the same identical BR’s
as the ones of χχ into two-body SM ﬁnal states.

between Run-1 and Run-2, although the coupling to photons is quite larger than the
one to gluons. As far as LHC is concerned, the production of P occurs mainly from
b partons. The resulting BR’s for the annihilation of χχ into SM channels are shown
in Fig. 2.
The bb channel yields soft neutrinos for IceCube, for which the main channels remain
ZZ and Zγ.

(cid:5) Scenario C: P couples to B, g, u, χ and t. The chosen partial decay widths of P
are listed in table 3. We choose the coupling to tt to be the main one. This channel
does not contribute to the production at LHC, and ampliﬁes the signal for IC. The
production at LHC occurs via gluon fusion. The corresponding BR for χχ into SM
channels are plotted in Fig. 3.
Given its large BR, tt is the only important channel for IceCube.

We illustrate in the next section the main features of IceCube and its relevance in DM
searches. Section 4 shows the resulting bounds from IC and DD experiments for the three
scenarios just described.

3 Constraints on DM annihilations from the IceCube experiment

The IceCube experiment, located at the South Pole, is a neutrino telescope observing high
energy neutrinos by detecting Cherenkov photons radiated by charged particles produced in
their interactions [37]. Muons from νµ and νµ charged current interactions leave long visible
tracks within the detector, which can be easily reconstructed to estimate the direction of
the incoming neutrino. IceCube has an angular resolution of a few degrees for ∼ 100 GeV
νµ (and < 2◦ for ∼ for a 1 TeV νµ), allowing it to search for an excess of GeV-TeV neutrinos
from the direction of the Sun [38].

DM accumulates in celestial bodies if it loses some of its kinetic energy via elastic scat-
tering and remains gravitationally bound within them. As the DM number density nDM
increases, pairs of DM particles annihilate into SM ones, and some are lost due to evap-
oration (for further details, see Ref. [39] and references therein). The system eventually
reaches an equilibrium, and nDM freezes. Neglecting the evaporation rate, which is a plau-
sible assumption for mχ (cid:38) 10 GeV, at equilibrium the capture rate Γcap is equal to 2Γann,
where Γann is the annihilation rate of DM particles into SM particles and is proportional
to n2
DM. The capture rate Γcap is proportional to the elastic scattering cross section σpχ
between a proton and the DM particle χ. The higher Γcap, the faster the equilibrium is
reached. When equilibrium is achieved, σpχ can be directly related to the annihilation rate.
The key point to note is that once equilibrium is attained, in order to predict the
neutrino ﬂuxes searched for by IC only the ratios of the annihilation cross sections (or
branching ratios) matter, and these ratios can be directly related to LHC measured quanti-
ties. Indeed, once we know the ﬂux of neutrinos on Earth per DM annihilation, we can infer
an upper bound on the rate of DM annihilation from the non-observation of an excess over
the expected background. In other words, the neutrino ﬂuxes depend only on branching
ratios, not on the absolute value of annihilation rate.

– 7 –

The computation of the energy spectra of the neutrinos originated from the annihilation
of DM particles is performed including the electroweak corrections, which can signiﬁcantly
alter the neutrino spectra when the mass of the DM particles is larger than the electroweak
scale [40]. This is because soft electroweak gauge bosons are copiously radiated when the
mass of the DM is larger than the gauge boson mass, and this opens new channels in the
ﬁnal states, including neutrinos, which otherwise would be forbidden if such corrections
are neglected.
In order to implement such electroweak corrections, we make use of the
PPPC4DM ID code [41].

The current most stringent bounds on spin dependent DM-nucleon scattering cross
section from IC comes from a search employing 3 years of IC data [35]. The IC collaboration
presents constraints in terms of three benchmark cases: DM annihilation into b¯b, W +W −
and τ +τ−. The least stringent constraints are for DM annihilating 100% into b¯b, a situation
which produces few neutrinos and at energies much below the mass of the DM. DM particles
annihilating 100% to W +W − or τ +τ− produce a signiﬁcantly larger number of neutrinos
at energies close to the DM mass and consequently stronger bounds on the scattering cross
section. Neutrino ﬂux predictions for these cases can be obtained from WimpSim [42].

Figure 4. Upper limits on the DM annihilation rate in the Sun for the IceCube benchmark
channels, as well as the three scenarios discussed above. The benchmark limits shown and used
for rescaling conservatively correspond to the upper edge of the systematics band in [35] and are
derived using the online ﬂux conversion tool provided by the authors of WimpSim [43].

The event rate expected from a diﬀerential (anti)-muon neutrino ﬂux F(E) in an IC sample
of eﬀective area Aeﬀ is given by

ns (F) =

F(E) · Aeﬀ (E) dE,

These quantities can be calculated for neutrino ﬂux predictions calculated as described
before, and also for the benchmark channel predictions, for each of the three IC samples
described in Ref. [34]. Subsequently, the limit on the annihilation rate Γann for theoretical
neutrino ﬂux F(E) can be obtained by rescaling the benchmark limits according to the
expression:

Γtheory
ann = Γbenchmark

ann

· ns(Fbenchmark)
ns(Ftheory)

· Ψ (Emed(Ftheory))
Ψ (Emed(Fbenchmark))

,

(3.3)

where Ψ(E) is the angular resolution of the IceCube sample at at neutrino energy E. This
scaling is possible because the search is performed using the unbinned maximum likelihood
√
Background and the
ratio method [33, 34], for which the sensitivity scales with Signal/
background level varies as Ψ2. In practice a scaling factor averaged over the three samples
weighted by their exposure at the median energy is used. For a given Ftheory, σtheory
can be calculated with respect to any of the three benchmark IC channels. The diﬀerent
calculations are consistent to within ∼ 30% and are thus averaged.

The limits on Γann for the IC benchmark channels can be obtained from the limits on
σ using tools provided by WimpSim and DarkSuSy [43]. Figure 4 illustrates the limits on
Γann for the scenarios discussed above, as well as for the IC benchmark cases.

4 Results and discussions

Having set our benchmark models describing the interactions of the pseudoscalar P with
the SM particles and having addressed the way we deal with the IC physics, we now proceed
to present our results in the cases in which the DM is a fermion and a scalar.

4.1 The case of fermionic DM
Using the solar capture rates evaluated in Ref. [44], the bounds on Γann shown in Fig. 4
can be interpreted as a bound on σpχ for the operator ONR
6 = ((cid:126)sχ · (cid:126)q)((cid:126)sN · (cid:126)q). This operator
originates in the non-relativistic limit in the case in which the DM is a Dirac fermion χ.

In comparison to direct detection, bounds from solar DM searches are generally more
stringent in the scenario where the DM-nucleon scattering depends on the spin of the
nucleus, since the Sun consists of mostly protons, in contrast to the target nuclei used in
direct detection experiments which usually have no spin. Bounds on σpχ for the operator
((cid:126)sχ · (cid:126)q)((cid:126)sN · (cid:126)q) are signiﬁcantly weaker than for the common spin dependent operator due
to the double velocity suppression.

Our results are summarized in Fig. 5. Together with the current IC bounds obtained
using the procedure explained above, we show a forecast for the bound that could be
obtained by a similar neutrino telescope with 300 times the exposure. The sensitivity will
scale with the square root of exposure [33]. While the exposure scales linearly with time

Figure 5. Upper bounds on σpχ from Direct Detection and IceCube experiments, for fermionic
DM. DD constraints are shown with thick, solid coloured lines, and IC ones with thick dashed lines,
with the colour code for the three scenarios shown in the bottom right corner. With the same colour
code, we show also the expected signal for yχP = 1 (dotted lines), and the prediction obtained by
imposing that the relic density of χ and χ equals the observed one (thin solid lines). Forecasts for
a neutrino telescope with 300 times the exposure of IceCube are shown with a light blue band.

and an improvement of ∼ 300 is unlikely for IceCube, future proposed neutrino telescopes
such as KM3Net/ARCA [45] may achieve a similar improvement in sensitivity faster, using
larger volumes, better angular resolutions or improved analysis techniques. However, it
is not clear if future neutrino detectors will target the sub TeV energy range in primary
neutrinos that is crucial for Solar DM searches. Our results are summarized in Fig. 5.

The bounds from DD are obtained with the use of the software made available by
[46], which allows to derive easily the bounds on a combination of

the authors of Ref.
non-relativistic operators for the interaction between DM and nucleons.

We also show, as a tentative reference point, the expected σpχ for a value of yχP = 1,
from Eq. (A.3) and the lines corresponding to the points of the parameter space where the
relic energy density of the DM candidate through the freeze-out mechanism turns out to
be ΩDMh2 = 0.1196 ± 0.0031 [47].

The conclusion we draw from Fig. 5 is that the double velocity suppression arising in
the case of fermion DM and pseudoscalar mediator dramatically reduces the experimental
exclusion reach, and the constraints on the parameter of such a model are very weak. This
outcome further motivates us to investigate the case of scalar DM.

– 10 –

4.2 The case of scalar DM

In this case the non-relativistic operator for the interaction between the DM particle φ and
nucleon is ONR
10 = i((cid:126)sN ·(cid:126)q), which is SD and suppressed by one power of DM velocity, instead
of two as in the fermion DM case. This behaviour alters signiﬁcantly the experimental
bounds, as apparent from Fig. 6.

Figure 6. The same as in ﬁgure 5, for the case of scalar DM.

As a reference point, we show the predicted cross section for the value AP = 1 TeV
of the dimensionful coupling AP introduced in Eq. (2.3). The cross section σpφ, reported
P . We conclude that, in the case in which the DM is a
in Eq. (A.5), is proportional to A2
scalar particle, IC experimental bounds are important for two reasons: ﬁrst, for masses of
the DM larger than O(300) GeV, IC constraints are stronger than the bounds coming from
DD experiments and, secondly, they bound AP to be not larger than a few TeV. Forecasts
for a possible future neutrino telescope lower this bound to around 1 TeV in the region
(mφ ∼ 0.1 ÷ 1) TeV, improving signiﬁcantly the bounds from DD experiments in the mass
region close to mP .

5 Conclusions

Should future data collected by the LHC collaborations ATLAS and CMS conﬁrm the
existence of a new resonant state with a mass of around 750 GeV, the era of physics beyond
the SM would start. Following this wishful route, one can imagine that the resonance acts
a portal into the DM sector. By identifying three benchmark models, in this paper we have
investigated the possibility that the resonance is caused by a pseudoscalar particle which

– 11 –

also couples to either fermionic or scalar DM. Motivated by the fact that the bounds from
solar DM searches are generally more stringent than DD experiments when the DM-nucleon
scattering depends on the spin of the nucleus, we have analyzed the bounds coming from
the search for neutrinos originated from DM annihilations in the Sun performed by the IC
collaboration. Our ﬁndings indicate that the IC data provide constraints stronger than the
DD experiments for DM masses larger than a few hundred GeV. Furthermore, if the DM
is a scalar particle, the IC data limit the cross section between the DM and the proton to
values close to the predicted ones for natural values of the parameters.

A Relevant formulæ for scattering with protons, annihilation of DM and

computation of relic density

We report in this section the relevant formulæ for the computation of cross sections for DD,
for DM annihilations (which are relevant for IC), and of the relic density of DM.

A.1 Elastic scattering between proton and DM
Fermionic DM The eﬀective operator for the interaction between χ and a nucleon N is
(throughout this section we follow the notation of Ref. [46])

where the coeﬃcient yχP is introduced in Eq. (2.2), and we deﬁne cN as

where vDM is the DM particle velocity in the centre-of-mass frame (which we assume to be
220 km/s), and µN = mχmN
mχ+mN

is the DM-nucleon reduced mass.

We notice that this cross section is suppressed by the fourth power of the velocity
of DM, as a result of the presence of the two pseudoscalar Lorentz bilinears in Eq. (A.1)
which in the non-relativistic limit reduce each to the scalar product of the spin of the
correspondent particle and of (cid:126)q.

Scalar DM The eﬀective operator for the interaction between the DM particle φ and a
nucleon is

where AP is the parity-odd dimensionful coeﬃcient introduced in Eq. (2.3), and cN is
deﬁned in Eq. (A.2). The corresponding cross section in the low velocity limit is

We point out that in this case σN φ is suppressed just by the second power of vDM, accord-

contains only one pseudoscalar Lorentz bilinear.

A.2 Annihilation of DM pairs into SM channels

We highlight with a shade of grey the terms that are common to all ﬁnal states, and simplify
when computing the branching ratios for the annihilation of DM pairs into SM channels.
These are indeed the relevant quantities for computing the neutrino ﬂuxes for IC. This

– 13 –

interesting simpliﬁcation makes IC bound independent of the coupling of P to DM, of mP
and of ΓP .

The analogue formula to Eq. (A.14) for the case of scalar DM is:

(A.15)

The centre-of-mass energy s, when applying Eq.s (A.3) and (A.5) to DM annihilations
inside the Sun, has to be evaluated with the typical kinetic energy of DM particles in the
Sun. We notice that all the squared matrix elements in Eqs. (A.6)-(A.12) in the low velocity
expansion have a non vanishing constant term. We assume as a reference kinetic energy
the thermal one inside the core of the Sun, around ∼ 1 keV (corresponding to a velocity
10−4 for mχ ∼ 100 GeV).

A.3 Relic density of DM via freeze-out
We collect the main formulæ needed to compute the actual relic abundance of DM. For a
thorough discussion, we refer to Refs. [48, 49].

By deﬁning x = mDM/T , the expression for the thermally averaged cross section (cid:104)σv(cid:105)

at a temperature T reads [48]

(cid:0)K2(x)(cid:1)2

where Ki is the modiﬁed Bessel function of order i.

The relic abundance is then obtained from [49, 50]

T0

where Tf is the freeze-out temperature, T0 is the present temperature, g(cid:63) is the degrees of
freedom parameter as a function of the temperature and the factor of 2 accounts for the
fact that the total DM density is the sum of the density of DM particles and antiparticles.
Note that here we approximate g(cid:63) = geﬀ = heﬀ, where geﬀ and heﬀ are the number of
degrees of freedom that enters the deﬁnition of the energy density and of the entropy
density respectively [48].

The freeze-out temperature Tf (or, equivalently, xf ) is deﬁned to be the temperature
at which the quantity Y = n/s diﬀers from its equilibrium value by Y − Yeq = c Yeq. With
a standard notation we indicate by n and s the number density of DM particles and the
(cid:113) 45
entropy density of the Universe. The value of xf is obtained by
8 gmDMMPlc(c + 2)(cid:104)σv(cid:105)

(A.18)

exf =

√

2π3g1/2

(cid:63)

,

where g = 1 (scalar), 2 (spinor) accounts for the number of spin states of the DM particle.
Following Ref. [48] we take c = 1.5.

– 14 –

The thermally averaged cross section appearing in the denominator of Eq. (A.17) can
be expanded as a function of x. This approximation can be slightly inaccurate when a
resonance is excited [51], because for mDM just below the resonance also higher orders
of the expansion of σann(v) at low velocity can matter. For this reason, we perform our
computation without expanding Eq. (A.16) in powers of vDM.
We report the results for the expansion of σ(χχ → ij) · vMøl in series of vMøl, to show
that the term of order zero in the velocity is always non vanishing. Therefore, the ﬁnal
value for the cross section does not depend strongly on the numerical value assumed for
DM velocity.

For the case of fermionic DM, the expanded cross sections read

σ(χχ → gg) · vMøl =

σ(χχ → γγ) · vMøl =

σ(χχ → Zγ) · vMøl =

σ(χχ → ZZ) · vMøl =
