Introduction

shown as formula (1):

China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) is under
construction, and three neutron scattering instruments
are built at the same time, belong which, the multi-
functional reﬂectometer employs a high pressure 3He gas
multi-wire proportional chamber (MWPC) as its neu-
tron detector[1]. This detector is designed using an 8
atm 3He/C3H8(80/20) mixture as working gas and gold-
plated tungsten as anode and signal wires. The sensitive
area of the detector is designed to be 200mm×200mm,
and the neutron space resolution is expected less than
2mm, besides the counting rate can reach to 107/cm2s[2].
As the inﬂuence of electrostatic force and gravity, the an-
ode and signal wires will have position oﬀset, as a result
the performance of the detector, including magniﬁcation,
position resolution, etc, will be aﬀected[3]. To ensure the
wires’ position deviation as small as possibleit is very
important to keep the wires with proper tensions, so we
have to measure and control the wire tension in the de-
tector construction. The principle of the wire tension
measurement is based on the relationship between the
tension and its vibration inherent frequency, which is

T = ρ(2Lf0)2.

(1)

Where T (N) is the wire tension, f0(Hz) is the wire
vibration fundamental frequency, ρ(kg/m)is the linear
mass density, and L(m)is the wire length.

Based on the principle, a lot of equipment was de-
signed, and in general they can be sorted into two classes.
In the ﬁrst class, it inputs diﬀerent periodic driving force
to a wire, and make the wire resonance, and then by de-
termining the resonance to measure the wire inherent
frequency. Because of driving force generator and reso-
nance determination module, these equipments are com-
plicated and the measurements are time consuming[4–
10].
In the other class, a short-time driving force was
used to make the wire to vibration, and then measuring
the signal of the vibration to analysis the wire inherent
frequency[11–15]. In these equipments, the wire inher-
ent frequency is measured directly, so the measurement
is quicker and more accurate, but they need a powerful
signal processing system.

In this paper, we present a simple, quick and accu-

rate equipment by adopting the wires’ vibration method
for measuring the wires’ tension in MWPC construction.

2 Description of tension measurement

system

According to Faraday’s lawwhen a wire with current
(I) is placed in a magnetic ﬁeld (B), it will experience a
force (F), and the force is equal to I·L×B. Meanwhile,
when a wire is moving in a magnetic ﬁeld with velocity ν,
electric potential is induced along the wire. The poten-
tial direction is equal to L·ν×B. Based on this principle,
we designed a simply equipped wire tension measure-
ment system: two electromagnets are used to generate
an adjustable magnetic ﬁeld, and the wire which will be
measured is placed between them. A mono-stable trig-
ger mode is used to produce narrow pulses, then the
pulses are ampliﬁed by a power ampliﬁer and used to
stimulate the wire to vibration in the magnetic ﬁeld. To
make sure the wire generates largest vibration, the pules’
widths are controlled to one fourth of the wire inherent
vibration period. Then the vibration signal, which is an
attenuate sine wave in theory, is ampliﬁed by a oper-
ational ampliﬁer module. At last, the vibration signal
is recorded and analyzed by a digital oscilloscope or a
computer controlled data acquisition board, and the vi-
bration frequency is measured. A schematic drawing of
the system is shown as Fig.??.

As shown in Fig.??, two electromagnets are operated
with a 30V DC low-voltage power supply and can pro-
duce a 5.0 cm2 uniform magnetic ﬁeld which has a maxi-
mum intensity about 2000 Gauss. The mono-stable trig-
ger, which is connected with a 1µF capacitor and a 10KΩ
variable resistor and operated with a 5V DC power, can
generate TTL pulse with a minimum width of 100µs. It
makes the system is suitable for measuring wires with
inherent vibration frequency no large than 2500Hz. The
power ampliﬁer in the system has a 3A rated current and
can amplify the a TTL pulse to 15V level. In the oper-
ational ampliﬁer module, a 500Ω resistor is connected
at input terminal and a 2MΩ potentiometer is used as
feedback resistor, so the voltage ampliﬁcation factor can
get up to 4000. For ﬂexibility, we design two options to
analyze vibration signals. One method is using a digital
oscilloscope to record the signal and do Fourier trans-
form, the other alternative is using an ADC data acqui-
sition board to converts the analog signals to digital sig-
nals and transmits them to computers, then a LabVIEW

program is used to display and analyze the signals. To
suppress direct current interference, 50µF capacitors are
used among diﬀerent function modules.

A vibration signal captured by oscilloscope and its
frequency spectrum are shown in Fig.??.
In this pic-
ture, the wire’s diameter, length and applied tension are
25µm, 240mm and 40g respectively, and the operation
voltage of the electromagnets is set at 30V. The highest
peak at about 420Hz on the frequency spectrum is the
inherent frequency, while the peaks at about 820Hz and
1260Hz are the second and third harmonics of the wire.
As this, measuring a wire’s frequency with the system
takes only a few seconds.

For ﬂexibility, an ADC data acquisition board and
a LabVIEW computer program are designed as an al-
ternative to a digital oscilloscope. The data acquisition
board has a sample rate of 80KHz and can convert ±8V
analog signals into digital ones. With a USB2.0 con-
nector digital signals in the board are transmitted to a
personal computer. Using a LabVIEW signal analysis
program, the measurement digital accuracy can reach to
1Hz, which can be neglected compared with the “statis-
tical” errors. Only taking a low-voltage power supply
and a personal computer, the system can be used at any
places we need. Fig.?? are the front panel and its corre-
sponding graphical program in the LabVIEW platform
respectively.

3 Performance of the measurement sys-

tem

3.1 Accuracy of the system

For testing the accuracy of the wire tension measure-
ment system, we measured 240mm long and 25µm di-
ameter wires with 20, 30, 40. . . 130g tension 40 times
respectively. Fig.?? is the measured frequency results of
20g tension wire, and we ﬁt the results with a gaussian
distribution function. The same data analysis procedure
is applied to the other measurements. The frequency av-
erage value and ﬁtted gaussian σ, which is marked with
“statistical error”, are listed in Tab.1. Meanwhile, the
wires’ diameters and tensions’ uncertainty is about 4%
and 1% respectively. According formula (1), these de-
viations can induce frequency uncertainty, and they are
listed in Tab.1 marked as “system errors”. We draw the
results in Fig.?? and ﬁt the results with a line. As shown
in the picture, the measurement system can distribute
diﬀerent wire tensions perfectly.

3.2 Signal-to-noise ratio V.S. magnetic intensity

As shown in Ref[11], by enhancing magnetic ﬁeld in-
tensity, we can increase the amplitudes of wires’ vibra-
tion signals and signal to noise ratio. So we set the
electromagnets’ voltage at diﬀerent values for checking
the system performance. Fig.?? (a)-(d) are the vibra-
tion signals and their frequency waveforms of wire with
25um diameter, 240mm long and 80g tension when the

electromagnet’s voltage is set at 10, 15, 20, 30V respec-
tively. As expected, the signal amplitude and the sig-
nal to noise ratio increased obviously with the magnetic
ﬁeld’s enhancement. Fig.?? is shown the signal ampli-
tudes and measured frequencies with diﬀerent magnetic
intensities. Fig.?? shown that the measurement errors.
Obviously, for getting better results, the system should
set the magnetic ﬁeld as strong as possible.

3.3 Wire length eﬀect

For testing the performance the system in measuring
diﬀerent size MWPC, we measured some 25µm diame-
ter wires with 50g tension, and the length of the wires
is from 250mm to 450mm. In these measurements, the
electromagnets’ voltage is 30V. Fig.1 is the results, as
displayed, the system can get correct frequencies for dif-
ferent length wires. As the results shown, wire’s ten-
sion of MWPC with sensitive area from 200mm×200mm
to 450mm×450mm can be measured by the system cor-
rectly.

3.4 The wires’ tension of an anode wire plane

In the MWPC neutron detector of MR in CSNS,
many 25µm, 206mm long wires with 50g tension are
melted on a PCB board parallel with 2mm intervals to
make a anode wire plane. To make sure the detector
have steady and uniform ampliﬁcation factor, the ten-
sion’s deviation is controlled to no larger than 10%. Us-
ing the system, we measured the wires’ tension. The
results are shown in Fig.2 and the error is about 3.5%.
This mean the wire tension control techniques in the wire
plane manufacture is reliable and accurate.

4 Discussion

For the construction of MWPC neutron detectors
in CSNS, we developed a portable, accurate and time-
saving wire tension measurement system. With a low-
voltage power supply and a digital oscilloscope or a
personal computer, the system can measure a wire’s
tension in a few seconds and the error is about 3Hz.

Compared with the wire’s diameter and tension uncer-
tainties, the measurement error is very small and can
be neglected.We also use the system testing all wires’
tension in an anode wire pane of a MWPC, the results
shown the wire tension control methods in the detector
construction is reliable, and they can make the detector
work steady in the future.
