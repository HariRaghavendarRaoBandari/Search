RIEMANNIAN GEOMETRY OF THE SPACE OF VOLUME

PRESERVING IMMERSIONS

MARTIN BAUER, PETER W. MICHOR, AND OLAF M ¨ULLER

Abstract. Given a compact manifold M and a Riemannian manifold N of

bounded geometry, we consider the manifold Imm(M, N) of immersions from
M to N and its subset Immµ(M, N) of those immersions with the property
non-minimal elements of Immµ(M, N) form a splitting submanifold. On this

that the volume-form of the pull-back metric equals µ. We ﬁrst show that the

submanifold we consider the Levi-Civita connection for various natural Sobolev
metrics write down the geodesic equation and show local well-posedness in
many cases. The question is a natural generalization of the corresponding
well-posedness question for the group of volume-preserving diﬀeomorphisms,
which is of great importance in ﬂuid mechanics.

for various reasons; e.g., in the case of closed surfaces in R3 this condition restricts
to convex surfaces only. Thus, as a ﬁrst step, we want to ged rid of that additional
condition and show a similar statement for the spaces in the above diagram. Similar,
as in [19], the proof of this statements will be an application of the Nash-Moser
inverse function theorem, however we will have to consider a diﬀerent splitting of
the tangent space. The proof of these statements will be given in Sect. 2. However
we will still be forced to require the immersions to be not minimal; i.e., they do not
have an everywhere vanishing mean curvature. In the case of embeddings into R3,
the absence of compact minimal embeddings already shows that this is only a weak

Remark. This result is stronger then the one in [19]. There it has only been shown
that the space of embeddings with nowhere vanishing mean curvature is a a tame

splitting Fr´echet submanifold of Emb(M, N). The condition of having a nowhere

vanishing mean curvature is, however, too restrictive for our purposes, since it only
allows for convex (resp. concave) surfaces in the case of hypersurfaces.

Remark. Our main subject will be spaces of immersions, but note that the proofs
of most theorems, e.g., of the previous one, immediately carry over to the smaller
spaces of embeddings.

The ﬁrst step in the proof of the theorem (modeled after the proof of the corre-
sponding theorem in [19]) is the following proposition which allows to decompose
any vector ﬁeld h along f into a part hµ that is divergence-free – in the sense that
its ﬂow preserves the volume µ – and its complement.

Now we would like to show that the projection, extends to a smooth mapping
on Sobolev completions of suﬃcient high order. However, one major building block
towards this result is missing, namely elliptic theory for pseudo diﬀerential operators
with Sobolev coeﬃcients acting as isomorphism between spaces of Sobolev sections
in a certain range of Sobolev orders. For the case of diﬀerential operators the
relevant results have been proved in [20] and used in the proof of Thm. 1. The
proofs for pseudo diﬀerential operators will be done in a future paper. This will
