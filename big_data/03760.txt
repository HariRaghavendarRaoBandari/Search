Abstract: Four-dimensional gravity in the presence of a dilatonic scalar ﬁeld and an
Abelian gauge ﬁeld is considered. This theory corresponds to the bosonic sector of a
Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity which induces a de-
termined self-interacting potential for the scalar ﬁeld. We compute the conserved charges
and carry out the thermodynamics of an anti-de Sitter (AdS) dyonic black hole solution
recently proposed. The charges coming from symmetries of the action are computed by
using the Regge-Teitelboim Hamiltonian approach. These correspond to the mass, which
acquires contributions from the scalar ﬁeld, and the electric charge. Integrability condi-
tions are introduced because the scalar ﬁeld leads to non-integrable terms in the variation
of the mass. These conditions are generically solved by introducing boundary conditions
that arbitrarily relates the leading and subleading terms of the scalar ﬁeld fall-oﬀ. The
Hamiltonian Euclidean action, computed in the grand canonical ensemble, is obtained by
demanding the action to attain an extremum. Its value is given by a radial boundary term
plus an additional polar angle boundary term due to the presence of a magnetic monopole.
Remarkably, the magnetic charge can be identiﬁed from the variation of the additional
polar angle boundary term, conﬁrming that the ﬁrst law of black hole thermodynamics is
a consequence of having a well-deﬁned and ﬁnite Hamiltonian action principle, even if the
charge does not come from a symmetry of the action. The temperature and electrostatic
potential are determined demanding regularity on the black hole solution, whereas the value
of the magnetic potential is already identiﬁed in the variation of the additional polar angle
boundary term. Consequently, the ﬁrst law of black hole thermodynamics is identically
satisﬁed by construction.

Introduction

It has been recently conjectured about the need of additional terms in the ﬁrst law of
black hole thermodynamics, interpreted as scalar charges for a new class of dyonic black
hole introduced in [1], [2]. This black hole is asymptotically AdS provided the system is
endowed with a self-interacting potential. The theory is described by the action of the
bosonic sector coming from a consistent truncation of a S7 reduction of eleven-dimensional
supergravity [3]. In the thermodynamic analysis of [1], the authors claimed that the ﬁrst
law is not satisﬁed unless one adds a term which is interpreted as a scalar charge [1], [2].
However, this argument conﬂicts with the fact that there is no gauge symmetry related to
the presence of a single scalar ﬁeld, i.e., there is no a Noether charge associated to this
Lagrangian (nor a topological charge as is the case of the magnetic charge). Moreover,
it has been clearly identiﬁed that the scalar ﬁeld generically contributes to the mass with
non-integrable terms. This has been proved with general asymptotic conditions through
Hamiltonian [4] and other methods [5], [6], and even with an explicit black hole example in
presence of gauge ﬁelds in three dimensions [7]. In this context, in [8] is presented a new class
of dyonic AdS black hole solutions of four-dimensional N = 8, SO(8) gauge supergravity
where the AdS4 dyonic dilatonic black hole of [1] is included. It is found in fact that the
missing term, supposedly related to a scalar charge, is a contribution to the variation of
the mass. It is also pointed out in [8] that the non-integrability of this term leads to an
ill-deﬁned mass with independent electric and magnetic charges. However, as it will be
shown in this manuscript, it is possible to impose general integrability conditions. One
can settle some physical criterium that is manifested through suitable boundary conditions
which determine the arbitrary functions coming from the integrability conditions. One
possible criterium is to demand the preservation of the AdS symmetry of the scalar ﬁeld
fall-oﬀ [9], [4], obtaining that the scalar ﬁeld contribution is cancelled by a term coming
from the gravitational contribution to the mass.

Other motivation for studying the black hole solution presented in [1] has to do with the
computation of its Gibbs free energy. For doing so, it requires to have a well deﬁned action
and also presenting other thermodynamic features such that to exhibit all the charges of the
solution with their respective chemical potentials. The Gibbs free energy presented in [1]
fails on that, since they cannot recover the magnetic contribution to the Euclidean action,
not even including the supposed scalar charge. The value of the action in [1] was obtained
through the holographic renormalization method described in [10] by adding counterterms
which only considers radial surface terms to get a ﬁnite action principle. As we will show
bellow, it is necessary an additional polar angle boundary term for obtaining the magnetic
contribution to the Euclidean action. For proving the latter, we formulate a well-deﬁned
and ﬁnite Hamiltonian action principle for the system and we prove that this additional
boundary term comes from a total derivative in the polar angle which appears due to the
black hole solution is endowed with a magnetic monopole.

The aim of this paper is to compute the conserved charges of the AdS4 dyonic black
hole and also to formulate a well-deﬁned and ﬁnite Hamiltonian action principle for the
described system which allows to obtain the value of the Hamiltonian Euclidean action. By

imposing the grand canonical ensemble, the Gibbs free energy is chosen as our thermody-
namic potential which, unlike the free energy computed in [1], exhibits all the conserved
charges of the solution, i.e., the mass (with its respective scalar ﬁeld contribution), the
electric charge and the magnetic charge. The plan of this manuscript is the following, in
the Section 2 we present the Lagrangian and the AdS4 dyonic dilatonic black hole solution
of [1]. Section 3 is focused on the Hamiltonian analysis and the corresponding conserved
charges. The mass and the electric charge are computed by using the Regge-Teitelboim
Hamiltonian approach. In the variation of the mass there are two contributions, the grav-
itational and the scalar ﬁeld part (already identiﬁed in [8]). Integrability conditions are
needed to be imposed since the presence of the scalar ﬁeld leads to a non-integrable term.
Suitable boundary conditions are chosen in order to preserve the AdS symmetry of the
scalar ﬁeld fall-oﬀ. This implies a precise relation on the coeﬃcients of the leading and
subleading terms of the scalar ﬁeld, as was noted for this kind of systems in [4]. In Sec-
tion 4 we perform the thermodynamic analysis of the solution. In there, the Hamiltonian
Euclidean action is introduced, where for simplicity the calculations are done in a suitable
Euclidean minisuperspace. For obtaining the Gibbs free energy we compute the value of
the Euclidean Hamiltonian action endowed with a suitable radial boundary term and an
additional polar angle boundary term. These terms are needed to be added in order to have
a well-deﬁned and ﬁnite Hamiltonian action principle. From the variation of the boundary
term at inﬁnity is possible to identify the variation of the Hamiltonian conserved charges
of this system, which are the mass and electric charge. On the other hand, the variation of
the magnetic charge comes from the additional polar boundary term. This boundary term
has to be considered due to the presence of a magnetic monopole. The chemical potentials
associated to Noether charges are Lagrange multipliers of the system at inﬁnity. They are
obtained through regularity conditions at the horizon, unlike the magnetic potential which
remarkably already appears determined in the variation of the boundary term besides the
magnetic charge. It is worth to note that the ﬁrst law of black hole thermodynamics is
satisﬁed independently of the integrability conditions on the mass, since the relation only
involves the variation of the conserved charges. Once the Gibbs free energy is obtained, the
value of the mass, electric charge, magnetic charge and entropy are veriﬁed by using the
known thermodynamic relations. Finally, Section 5 is devoted to some concluding remarks.

2 AdS4 dyonic black hole solution

We consider four-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant in presence of an
Abelian gauge ﬁeld and a dilatonic scalar ﬁeld with a self-interacting potential. The action

where the coupling constant g determines the AdS radius as (cid:96)2 = g−2. The theory given
by (2.1) corresponds to the bosonic sector of two possible dimensional reductions, which
depend on the coupling constant g. In the case of vanishing g, the action is obtained after
a S1 reduction of ﬁve-dimensional pure gravity. On the other hand if g (cid:54)= 0 the action can
be obtained after a S7 reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity as was found in [3].

In the case of β1 = β2, the dilatonic scalar ﬁeld is decoupled and the solution turns
out to be an AdS dyonic Reissner-Nordström black hole where the electric and magnetic
charges have the same value. If β1 = 0 the solution is purely magnetic and in the case of
β2 = 0 the conﬁguration becomes purely electric. If µ = 0 the solution turns out to be the
anti-de Sitter spacetime.

where the boundary term Q(cid:2)ξ, ξA(cid:3), which corresponds to the conserved charges in the

(3.1)

d3x

Regge-Teitelboim approach, ensures that the Hamiltonian generator has well-deﬁned func-
tional derivatives [14]. The bulk term appearing in (3.1) is a linear combination of the
constraints H⊥, Hi and G, where the ﬁrst two are the energy and momentum densities, and
the last one corresponds to the Gauss constraint associated to the Abelian gauge ﬁeld. The

asymptotic surface deformations of the spacetime are given by the vector ξ =(cid:0)ξ⊥, ξi(cid:1), and

ξA in turn is the gauge parameter of the Abelian symmetry. The constraints are explicitly

3.1 Conserved charges of the AdS4 dyonic black hole
In order to obtain the above surface integrals, let us consider a static and spherically
symmetric minisuperspace in which the AdS4 dyonic black hole (2.8) is included. For
simplicity in the upcoming analysis we perform the following change of variable in the
radial coordinate

(3.16)

and the scalar ﬁeld also depends on the radial coordinate φ = φ(ρ). Taking in considera-
tion this minisuperspace the only nonvanishing momentum is the radial component of the
electromagnetic one, where πρ = pρ (ρ, θ). Therefore, the value of the Hamiltonian charges,
computed on the sphere S2 of inﬁnite radius, is given by

In order to compute and perform a proper analysis of the charges, we must give suitable

The coeﬃcients in the expansions given above are parameters that depend on the integration

2It has to be noted that a divergent term appears in the variation of the charge but it vanishes once the
solution is replaced. This is because the divergent part of the gravitational contribution is cancelled by the
divergent part of the scalar ﬁeld contribution by virtue of the relation δF0 = g2

approach is obtained from δM = δQ(cid:2)ξt(cid:3), while the electric charge is the charge associated

fall-oﬀ, which can be carried out since the AdS4 dyonic dilatonic black hole of [1] is within
the asymptotic conditions for AdS spacetimes analyzed in [9], [4]. In there, they construct
a set of boundary conditions for having a well-deﬁned and ﬁnite Hamiltonian generators
for all the elements of the anti-de Sitter algebra in the case of gravity minimally coupled to
scalar ﬁelds. Then, we are allowed to impose certain relations on the leading and subleading
terms of the scalar ﬁeld fall-oﬀ provided the scalar ﬁeld does not break the AdS symme-
try at inﬁnity. These boundary conditions are (φ1 = 0, φ2 (cid:54)= 0), (φ1 (cid:54)= 0, φ2 = 0) and
1, where c is a constant without variation. In terms of the integration constants
φ2 = cφ2
the latter relation becomes

From eq. (3.35) we observe three cases, two of them nontrivial. When µ = 0 (3.35) holds,
the mass, the electric charge and magnetic charge vanish giving rise to the vacuum solution
which turns out to be the AdS4 spacetime. The other two cases imply that β1 = β1 (β2) in
such a way that they make the terms proportionals to g2 in (3.29) to vanish. Hence, the
mass becomes the AMD mass [15], [16] obtained in [1],

M =

.

(3.36)

This fact is in agreement with [17], where it is pointed out that in hairy spacetimes the
mass does not receive scalar ﬁeld contributions provided the scalar ﬁeld respects the AdS
invariance at inﬁnity, making some holographic prescriptions suitable for computing the
mass.

4 Thermodynamics of the AdS4 dyonic black hole

The thermodynamic analysis of the AdS4 dyonic dilatonic black hole is performed in this
section. We deﬁne the Euclidean Hamiltonian action of the theory including a surface term
and a additional polar boundary term to have a ﬁnite action principle. The presence of
the latter additional term is due to the solution counts with a magnetic monopole. For
simplicity, we take a minisuperspace in which the AdS4 dyonic black hole is included. The
variation of the Euclidean Hamiltonian action is computed in the grand canonical ensemble,
where the chemical potentials are ﬁxed. Remarkably, the magnetic charge emerges from
the additional polar boundary term accompanied by its respective chemical potential. The
value of the temperature and electric potential, on the other hand, are settled imposing
regularity conditions. When the variation of the additional surface and polar boundary
terms is determined, as was mentioned above, integrability conditions are needed to be
impose to determine the value of the Euclidean Hamiltonian action leading to the Gibbs
free energy.

4.1 Hamiltonian action and Euclidean minisuperspace
Let us consider spacetimes with manifold of topology R2 × S2. The plane R2 is centered at
the event horizon r+ and is parametrized by the periodic Euclidean time τ and the radial
coordinate r. These plane coordinates range as

0 ≤ τ < β,
r+ ≤ r < ∞,

(4.1)
(4.2)

with β the inverse of the Hawking temperature and the 2-sphere S2 stands for the topology
of the base manifold. The Hamiltonian Euclidean action for the system is given by

where Σ = R× S2 is the spatial section of the manifold. Note that the additional term B in
(4.3) needs to be added to the action in order to have a well-deﬁned variational principle,
and it is crucial for determining the value of the action for stationary conﬁgurations.

The Euclidean continuation of the AdS4 dyonic black hole (2.8) is considered. The line

In this expression is possible to recognize two kind of terms, the surface term coming from
a total derivative in the radial coordinate and a boundary term that comes from a total
derivative in the polar angle, which clearly is not vanishing since the presence of an angular
component depending on the polar angle in the gauge ﬁeld. The analysis of the variation
of the term B and the evaluation on the AdS4 dyonic black hole (4.16) will be performed
in the following subsection.

4.2 Gibbs free energy and ﬁrst law
From (4.16), we can identify diﬀerent contributions depending whether the term comes
from a total derivative in the radial coordinate, or whether the term comes from a total
derivative in the polar angle which is identiﬁed as a polar boundary term. The surface term
evaluated at inﬁnity will be denoted by δB (∞) and, on the other hand, δB(r+) will stand
for the surface term at the horizon. The polar boundary term in turn will be denoted by
δBθ. Hence, the variation of B (4.16) can be written as

δB = δB(∞) + δB(r+) + δBθ,

(4.17)

Once the diﬀerent contributions to the variation of B are identiﬁed one can analyze
their physical content. In the surface term at inﬁnity δB (∞) is possible to ﬁnd the variation
of the charges coming from symmetries of the action together with their respective chemical
potentials, which correspond to the Lagrange multipliers at inﬁnity of the respective sym-
metry (as was shown in Section 3). This is because at the end of the day the term (4.18) is
obtained from the boundary term of the Hamiltonian which ensures that the canonical gen-
erators have well-deﬁned functional derivatives [14]. Then, from δB (∞) it will be identiﬁed
the variations of the mass and the electric charge of the AdS4 dyonic dilatonic black hole.
From the surface term at the horizon δB (r+) will be obtained the entropy of the black hole
which corresponds to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Finally, from the polar boundary
term δBθ can be identiﬁed the contribution of the topological charge of the system leading
to the variation of the magnetic charge multiplied by the magnetic potential.

Let us to introduce the Euclidean continuation of the AdS4 dyonic dilatonic black hole
that satisﬁes the ﬁeld equations (4.11)-(4.14) and the constraints (4.10). This is obtained
after performing the identiﬁcations t → −iτ and β1 → −β1 in the Lorentzian solution,
which make the black hole functions to take the form

(4.23)

Note that the possibility of adding a constant Φe allows to have a regular gauge ﬁeld at
the horizon. This constant is related to the electrostatic potential of the solution when
the regularity conditions on the black hole are established. The angular component of the
gauge ﬁeld takes the same deﬁnition given in (2.14).

Replacing the Euclidean continuation of the AdS4 dyonic dilatonic black hole in the

surface term at inﬁnity δB (∞) given in eq. (4.18), it is obtained that

δB (∞) = −βδM − βΦeδQe,

The temperature is obtained by demanding the absence of conical singularities around the
event horizon, while the electrostatic potential comes from the trivial holonomy condition of
the gauge ﬁeld around a temporal cycle on the plane r−τ at the event horizon. Introducing
the values of the chemical potentials (4.28) into the surface term at the horizon δB (r+),
we get that this term exactly coincides with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy

In consequence, the variation of the boundary term B is given by

(4.32)

(4.34)

Note that once this term is integrated, the value of B corresponds to the Euclidean Hamil-
tonian action I E evaluated on stationary conﬁgurations and on the constraints surface. In
the grand canonical ensemble I E is related to the Gibbs free energy as I E = −βG. It is
also worth to point out that since the ﬁrst law of black hole thermodynamics,

δM = T δS − ΦeδQe − ΦmδQm,

(4.35)

is a consequence that the Euclidean action to attain an extremum, (4.35) is identically
satisﬁed independently of the boundary conditions on the mass. This is because (4.35) is
a relation that only involves the variation of the conserved charges. This can be explicitly
proved by introducing the computed value for the charge variations (4.25), (4.26), (4.33)
and the chemical potentials obtained by using regularity conditions (4.28) into (4.35).

Once the mass is integrated using arbitrary boundary conditions (see Section 3), it is
possible to ﬁnd the value of the Gibbs free energy which is equivalent Euclidean Hamiltonian
action evaluated on-shell,

I E = S − βM − βΦeQe − βΦmQm.

(4.36)

Recalling that we have chosen the grand canonical ensemble and taking the Euclidean
action as our thermodynamic potential, the values of the extensive quantities; mass, electric

5 Concluding remarks

We have carried out the thermodynamic analysis of a new class of AdS4 dyonic dilatonic
black hole recently proposed in [1], which is a solution of the bosonic sector of a Kaluza-Klein
dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity. The Noether conserved charges
were computed using the Regge-Teitelboim Hamiltonian approach. These correspond to
the mass, which acquires contributions from the scalar ﬁeld and the electric charge.
It
was also shown that the mass acquires non-integrable contributions from the scalar ﬁeld,
then it was necessary to impose integrability conditions for having a deﬁnite mass. These
conditions are generically solved by introducing boundary conditions that arbitrarily relate
the leading and subleading terms of the scalar ﬁeld fall-oﬀ. A possible physical criterium
to establish the arbitrary functions coming from the integrability condition is to preserve
the AdS symmetry of the scalar ﬁeld behavior at inﬁnity as was established in [9], [4].
The Hamiltonian Euclidean action was computed by demanding the action to attain an
extremum, where its value was given by the corresponding radial boundary term plus an
additional polar angle boundary term, since the presence of a magnetic monopole. The
computation was performed in the grand canonical ensemble. From the thermodynamic
analysis, the conserved charges were identiﬁed. Noether charges, mass and electric charge,
were obtained from the radial boundary term at inﬁnity unlike the magnetic charge, that
comes from the additional polar angle boundary term. Remarkably, the magnetic potential
appeared already determined in the variation of such boundary term, unlike the chemical
potentials associated to Noether charges which are Lagrange multipliers of the system at
inﬁnity. They are obtained through regularity conditions at the horizon. Considering the
above, it is possible to verify that the ﬁrst law of black hole thermodynamics is identically
satisﬁed. This is a consequence of having a well-deﬁned and ﬁnite Hamiltonian action
principle.

A diﬀerent way to deal with the thermodynamics of dyonic black holes is to consider
a manifestly duality invariant action that involves two U(1) symmetries, producing the ap-
pearance of electric and magnetic Gauss constraints [18]. The dyonic Reissner-Nordström
black hole is solution of system proposed in [18], however in this case the magnetic and
electric ﬁeld appear as Coulombian potentials, hence the solution is devoid of stringy sin-
gularities.
In this case, all the conserved charges appearing in the ﬁrst law come from
symmetries of the action.

It would be interesting to analyze the existence of phase transitions between this dyonic
dilatonic black hole solution and the dyonic Reissner-Nordström black hole, and studying
the chance that bellow a critical temperature the dyonic Reissner-Nordström black hole
undergoes spontaneously to a dressing state with a dilaton scalar ﬁeld. This kind of results
have been reproduced, for instance, in the case of four-dimensional topological black holes
dressed with a scalar ﬁeld in [19].
