Interpolation of data by smooth non-negative

functions

Charles Feﬀerman, Arie Israel, Garving K. Luli ∗

March 9, 2016

Introduction

Continuing from [18], we prove a ﬁniteness principle for interpolation of data
by nonnegative Cm functions. Our result raises the hope that one can start
to understand constrained interpolation problems in which e.g. the interpo-
lating function F is required to be nonnegative.

Let us recall some notation used in [18].
We ﬁx positive integers m, n. We write Cm (Rn) to denote the Banach

space of all real valued locally Cm functions F on Rn, for which the norm

kFkCm(Rn) := sup
x∈Rn

max
|α|≤m

|∂αF (x)|

is ﬁnite.

We will also work with the function space Cm−1,1(Rn). A given continuous

function F : Rn
derivatives ∂βF belong to L∞ (Rn) for |β| ≤ m. We may take the norm on
Cm−1,1 (Rn) to be

→ R belongs to Cm−1,1 (Rn) if and only if its distribution

ess. sup

x∈Rn(cid:12)(cid:12)∂βF (x)(cid:12)(cid:12) .

Expressions c (m, n), C (m, n), k (m, n), etc. denote constants depending
only on m, n; these expressions may denote diﬀerent constants in diﬀerent
occurrences. Similar conventions apply to constants denoted by C (m, n, D),
k (D), etc.

If X is any ﬁnite set, then # (X) denotes the number of elements in X.
We are now ready to state our main theorem.

Theorem 1 For large enough k# = k (m, n) and C# = C (m, n) the follow-
ing hold.

(A) Cm FLAVOR Let f : E → [0,∞) with E ⊂ Rn ﬁnite. Suppose that

for each S ⊂ E with # (S) ≤ k#, there exists FS ∈ Cm (Rn) with norm

(cid:13)(cid:13)FS(cid:13)(cid:13)Cm(Rn) ≤ 1, such that FS = f on S and FS ≥ 0 on Rn.

Then there exists F ∈ Cm (Rn) with norm kFkCm(Rn) ≤ C#, such that
F = f on E and F ≥ 0 on Rn.

that for each S ⊂ E with # (S) ≤ k#, there exists FS ∈ Cm−1,1 (Rn) with

(B) Cm−1,1 FLAVOR Let f : E → [0,∞) with E ⊂ Rn arbitrary. Suppose
norm (cid:13)(cid:13)FS(cid:13)(cid:13)Cm−1,1(Rn) ≤ 1, such that FS = f on S and FS ≥ 0 on Rn.

Then there exists F ∈ Cm−1,1 (Rn) with norm kFkCm−1,1(Rn) ≤ C#, such
that F = f on E and F ≥ 0 on Rn.

Our interest in Theorem 1 arises in part from its possible connection to
the interpolation algorithm of Feﬀerman-Klartag [15, 16]. Given a function

f : E → R with E ⊂ Rn ﬁnite, the goal of [15, 16] is to compute a function

F ∈ Cm(Rn) such that F = f on E, with ||F||Cm(Rn) as small as possible up
to a factor C(m, n). Roughly speaking, the algorithm in [15, 16] computes
such an F using O(N log N) computer operations, where N = #(E). The
algorithm is based on an easier version [10] of Theorem 1. Our present result
diﬀers from the easier version in that we have added the hypothesis FS ≥ 0
and the conclusion F ≥ 0. Accordingly, Theorem 1 raises the hope that we
can start to understand constrained interpolation problems, in which e.g. the
interpolant F is required to be nonnegative everywhere on Rn.

For results related to Theorem 1, we refer the reader to our paper [18]

and references therein.

In the following sections, we will set up the notation; then we will recall

a main theorem in [18] and use it to prove Theorem 1.

This paper is part of a literature on extension, interpolation, and selection
of functions, going back to H. Whitney’s seminal work [33], and including

1 Notation and Preliminaries

1.1 Background Notation

Fix m, n ≥ 1. We will work with cubes in Rn; all our cubes have sides parallel
to the coordinate axes. If Q is a cube, then δQ denotes the sidelength of Q.
For real numbers A > 0, AQ denotes the cube whose center is that of Q,
and whose sidelength is AδQ.

A dyadic cube is a cube of the form I1 × I2 × · · · × In ⊂ Rn, where each
Iν has the form [2k · iν, 2k · (iν + 1)) for integers i1, · · · , in, k. Each dyadic
cube Q is contained in one and only one dyadic cube with sidelength 2δQ;
that cube is denoted by Q+.

We write Bn (x, r) to denote the open ball in Rn with center x and radius

r, with respect to the Euclidean metric.

We write P to denote the vector space of all real-valued polynomials of
degree at most (m − 1) on Rn. If x ∈ Rn and F is a real-valued Cm−1 function
on a neighborhood of x, then Jx (F) (the “jet” of F at x) denotes the (m − 1)rst
order Taylor polynomial of F at x, i.e.,

Jx (F) (y) = X|α|≤m−1

1
α!

∂αF (x) · (y − x)α .

Thus, Jx (F) ∈ P.

3

For each x ∈ Rn, there is a natural multiplication ⊙x on P (“multiplica-

tion of jets at x”) deﬁned by setting

P ⊙x Q = Jx (PQ) for P, Q ∈ P.

If F is a real-valued function on a cube Q, then we write F ∈ Cm (Q) to
denote that F and its derivatives up to m-th order extend continuously to
the closure of Q. For F ∈ Cm (Q), we deﬁne

kFkCm(Q) = sup
x∈Q

max
|α|≤m

|∂αF (x)| .

The function space Cm−1,1(Q) and the norm k · kCm−1,1(Q) are deﬁned

analogously.

If F ∈ Cm (Q) and x belongs to the boundary of Q, then we still write
Jx (F) to denote the (m − 1)rst degree Taylor polynomial of F at x, even
though F isn’t deﬁned on a full neighborhood of x ∈ Rn.

Let S ⊂ Rn be non-empty and ﬁnite. A Whitney ﬁeld on S is a family of

polynomials

~P = (Py)y∈S (each Py ∈ P),

parametrized by the points of S.

We write Wh (S) to denote the vector space of all Whitney ﬁelds on S.
For ~P = (Py)y∈S ∈ Wh (S), we deﬁne the seminorm

=

max

x,y∈S,(x6=y),|α|≤m

|∂α (Px − Py) (x)|

|x − y|m−|α|

.

~P(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) ˙Cm(S)
(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

= 0.)

(If S consists of a single point, then (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

~P(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) ˙Cm(S)

We also need an elementary fact about convex sets.

Helly’s Theorem Let K1, · · · , KN ⊂ RD be convex. Suppose that Ki1 ∩ · · · ∩
KiD+1 is nonempty for any i1, · · · , iD+1 ∈ {1, · · · , N}. Then K1 ∩ · · · ∩ KN is
nonempty.

See [22].

1.2 Shape Fields

Let E ⊂ Rn be ﬁnite. For each x ∈ E, M ∈ (0,∞), let Γ (x, M) ⊆ P
be a (possibly empty) convex set. We say that ~Γ = (Γ (x, M))x∈E,M>0 is a
shape ﬁeld if for all x ∈ E and 0 < M′ ≤ M <∞, we have
Let ~Γ = (Γ (x, M))x∈E,M>0 be a shape ﬁeld and let Cw, δmax be positive
real numbers. We say that ~Γ is (Cw, δmax)-convex if the following condition
holds:

Γ (x, M′) ⊆ Γ (x, M) .

Let 0 < δ ≤ δmax, x ∈ E, M ∈ (0,∞), P1, P2, Q1, Q2 ∈ P. Assume that

(1) P1, P2 ∈ Γ (x, M);

(2) |∂β(P1 − P2)(x)| ≤ Mδm−|β| for |β| ≤ m − 1;

(3) |∂βQi(x)| ≤ δ−|β| for |β| ≤ m − 1 for i = 1, 2;

(4) Q1 ⊙x Q1 + Q2 ⊙x Q2 = 1.

Then

(5) P := Q1 ⊙x Q1 ⊙x P1 + Q2 ⊙x Q2 ⊙x P2 ∈ Γ (x, CwM).

1.3 Finiteness Principle for Shape Fields

We recall a main result proven in [18].

Theorem 2 For a large enough k# determined by m, n, the following holds.
Let ~Γ0 = (Γ0 (x, M))x∈E,M>0 be a (Cw, δmax)-convex shape ﬁeld and let Q0 ⊂ Rn
be a cube of sidelength δQ0 ≤ δmax. Also, let x0 ∈ E ∩ 5Q0 and M0 > 0 be
given. Assume that for each S ⊂ E with # (S) ≤ k# there exists a Whitney
ﬁeld ~PS = (Pz)z∈S such that

and

≤ M0,

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)
~PS(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) ˙Cm(S)

Pz ∈ Γ0 (z, M0) for all z ∈ S.

Then there exist P0 ∈ Γ0 (x0, M0) and F ∈ Cm (Q0) such that the following
hold, with a constant C∗ determined by Cw, m, n:

5

• Jz(F) ∈ Γ0 (z, C∗M0) for all z ∈ E ∩ Q0.

Q0

• |∂β(cid:0)F − P0(cid:1) (x) | ≤ C∗M0δm−|β|
• In particular, (cid:12)(cid:12)∂βF (x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ C∗M0 for all x ∈ Q0, |β| = m.

for all x ∈ Q0, |β| ≤ m.

2 Cm Interpolation by Nonnegative Functions

In this section, c, C, C′, etc. denote constants determined by m and n.
These symbols may denote diﬀerent constants in diﬀerent occurrences. For
x ∈ Rn and M > 0, deﬁne

(1) Γ∗ (x, M) =(cid:12) P ∈ P : There exists F ∈ Cm (Rn) with kFkCm(Rn) ≤ M,
It is not immediately clear how to compute Γ∗; we will return to this issue

F ≥ 0 on Rn, Jx (F) = P.

in a later section. Let E ⊂ Rn be ﬁnite, and let f : E → [0,∞). Deﬁne
~Γf = (Γf(x, M))x∈E,M>0, where
(2) Γf (x, M) = {P ∈ Γ∗ (x, M) : P (x) = f (x)}.
Lemma 1 ~Γf is a (C, 1)-convex shape ﬁeld.

(cid:13)

Proof. It is clear that ~Γf is a shape ﬁeld, i.e., each Γf(x, M) is convex, and
M′ ≤ M implies Γf(x, M′) ⊆ Γf(x, M). To establish (C, 1)-convexity, suppose
we are given the following:

(3) 0 < δ ≤ 1, x ∈ E, M > 0;

(4) P1, P2 ∈ Γf (x, M) satisfying

(6) Q1, Q2 ∈ P satisfying

(5) (cid:12)(cid:12)∂β (P1 − P2) (x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Mδm−|β| for |β| ≤ m − 1;
(7) (cid:12)(cid:12)∂βQi (x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ δ−|β| for |β| ≤ m − 1, i = 1, 2, and

(8) Q1 ⊙x Q1 + Q2 ⊙x Q2 = 1.

Set

6

(9) P = Q1 ⊙x Q1 ⊙x P1 + Q2 ⊙x Q2 ⊙x P2.

We must prove that

(10) P ∈ Γf (x, CM).

Thanks to (4), we have

(11) P1 (x) = f (x) and P2 (x) = f (x),

and there exist functions F1, F2 ∈ Cm(Rn) such that

(12) kFikCm(Rn) ≤ M (i = 1, 2),

(13) Fi ≥ 0 on Rn (i = 1, 2), and

(14) Jx (Fi) = Pi (i = 1, 2).

We ﬁx F1, F2 as above. By (8), we have |Qi(x)| ≥ 1√2

for i = 1 or for
i = 2. By possibly interchanging Q1 and Q2, and then possibly changing Q1
to −Q1, we may suppose that

(15) Q1 (x) ≥ 1√2

.

For small enough c0, (7) and (15) yield

(16) Q1 (y) ≥ 1

10 for |y − x| ≤ c0δ.

Fix c0 as in (16). We introduce a Cm cutoﬀ function χ on Rn with the

following properties.

(17) 0 ≤ χ ≤ 1 on Rn; χ = 0 outside Bn (x, c0δ); χ = 1 in a neighborhood

of x;

We then deﬁne ˜θ1 = χ · Q1 + (1 − χ) and ˜θ2 = χ · Q2.

(18) (cid:12)(cid:12)∂βχ(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Cδ−|β| on Rn, for |β| ≤ m.
These functions satisfy the following: ˜θi ∈ Cm (Rn) and (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
Bn (x, c0δ) we have ˜θ1 = 1 and ˜θ2 = 0. Setting θi = ˜θi ·(cid:16)˜θ

∂β˜θi(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
10 on Rn; Jx(cid:16)˜θi(cid:17) = Qi for i = 1, 2; outside
2(cid:17)−1/2

on Rn for |β| ≤ m, i = 1, 2; ˜θ1 ≥ 1

i = 1, 2, we ﬁnd that

≤ Cδ−|β|

1 + ˜θ

for

7

(19) θi ∈ Cm (Rn) and (cid:12)(cid:12)∂βθi(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Cδ−|β| on Rn for |β| ≤ m, i = 1, 2;

2 = 1 on Rn;

(20) θ2

1 + θ2

(21) Jx (θi) = Qi for i = 1, 2 (here we use (8)); and

(22) outside Bn (x, c0δ) we have θ1 = 1 and θ2 = 0.

Now set

(23) F = θ2

1F1 + θ2

2F2 = F1 + θ2

2 (F2 − F1) (see (20)).

Clearly F ∈ Cm(Rn). By (14), we have Jx(F2 − F1) = P2 − P1; hence (5)

yields the estimate

Together with (12), this tells us that

(cid:12)(cid:12)∂β (F2 − F1) (x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ CMδm−|β| for |β| ≤ m − 1.
(cid:12)(cid:12)∂β (F2 − F1)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ CMδm−|β| on Bn (x, c0δ) for |β| ≤ m.
2 · (F2 − F1)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ CMδm−|β| on Bn (x, c0δ) for |β| ≤ m.
(cid:12)(cid:12)∂β(cid:0)θ2

Recalling (19), we deduce that

Together with (12) and (23), this implies that

(cid:12)(cid:12)∂βF(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ CM on Bn (x, c0δ) ,

since 0 < δ ≤ 1 (see (3)). On the other hand, outside Bn(x, c0δ) we have
F = F1 by (22), (23); hence |∂βF| ≤ CM outside Bn(x, c0δ) for |β| ≤ m, by
(12). Thus, |∂βF| ≤ CM on all of Rn for |β| ≤ m, i.e.,

(24) kFkCm(Rn) ≤ CM.

Also, from (13) and (23) we have

(25) F ≥ 0 on Rn;

and (9), (14), (21), (23) imply that

8

(26) Jx (F) = Q1 ⊙x Q1 ⊙x P1 + Q2 ⊙x Q2 ⊙x P2 = P.

Since F ∈ Cm (Rn) satisﬁes (24), (25), (26), we have

(27) P ∈ Γ∗ (x, CM).

Moreover,

(28) P (x) = (Q1 (x))2 f (x) + (Q2 (x))2 f (x) = f (x),

thanks to (8), (9), (11).

From (27), (28) we conclude that P ∈ Γf(x, CM), completing the proof of

Lemma 1.

Lemma 2 Let (Px)x∈E be a Whitney ﬁeld on the ﬁnite set E, and let M > 0.
Suppose that

(29) Px ∈ Γ∗ (x, M) for each x ∈ E,

and that

(30) (cid:12)(cid:12)∂β(cid:0)Px − Px′(cid:1) (x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ M |x − x′|m−|β| for x, x′ ∈ E and |β| ≤ m − 1.

Then there exists F ∈ Cm(Rn) such that

(31) kFkCm(Rn) ≤ CM,

(32) F ≥ 0 on Rn, and

(33) Jx (F) = Px for all x ∈ E.

Proof. We modify slightly Whitney’s proof [33] of the Whitney extension
theorem. We say that a dyadic cube Q ⊂ Rn is “OK” if #(E ∩ 5Q) ≤ 1 and
δQ ≤ 1. Then every small enough Q is OK (because E is ﬁnite), and no Q
of sidelength δQ > 1 is OK. Also, let Q, Q′ be dyadic cubes with 5Q ⊂ 5Q′.
If Q′ is OK, then also Q is OK. We deﬁne a Calder´on-Zygmund (or CZ)
cube to be an OK cube Q such that no Q′ that strictly contains Q is OK.
The above remarks imply that the CZ cubes form a partition of Rn; that
the sidelengths of the CZ cubes are bounded above by 1 and below by some
positive number; and that the following condition holds.

(34) “Good Geometry”: If Q, Q′ ∈ CZ and 65

64 Q ∩ 65

64 Q′

6= ∅, then 1

2 δQ ≤

δQ′ ≤ 2δQ.

We classify CZ cubes into three types as follows.
Q ∈ CZ is of

Type 1 if E ∩ 5Q 6= ∅

Type 2 if E ∩ 5Q = ∅ and δQ < 1.

Type 3 if E ∩ 5Q = ∅ and δQ = 1.

Let Q ∈ CZ be of Type 1. Since Q is OK, we have #(E∩5Q) ≤ 1. Hence
E ∩ 5Q is a singleton, E ∩ 5Q = {xQ}. Since PxQ ∈ Γ∗ (xQ, M), there exists
FQ ∈ Cm (Rn) such that

(35) kFQkCm(Rn) ≤ M, FQ ≥ 0 on Rn, JxQ (FQ) = PxQ.

We ﬁx FQ as in (35).
Let Q ∈ CZ be of Type 2. Then δQ+ ≤ 1 but Q+ is not OK; hence # (E ∩ 5Q+) ≥

2. We pick xQ ∈ E ∩ 5Q+. Since PxQ ∈ Γ∗ (xQ, M), there exists FQ ∈ Cm (Rn)
satisfying (35). We ﬁx such an FQ.

Let Q ∈ CZ be of Type 3. Then we set FQ = 0. In place of (35), we have

the trivial results

(36) kFQkCm(Rn) = 0 and FQ ≥ 0 on Rn.

Thus, we have deﬁned FQ for all Q ∈ CZ, and we have deﬁned xQ ∈

E ∩ 5Q+ for all Q of Type 1 or Type 2. Note that

(37) Jx (FQ) = Px for all x ∈ E ∩ 5Q.

Indeed, if Q is of Type 1, then (37) follows from (35) since E ∩ 5Q = {xQ}.
If Q is of Type 2 or Type 3, then (37) holds vacuously since E ∩ 5Q = ∅.
Now suppose Q, Q′ ∈ CZ and 65

64 Q′ 6= ∅. We will show that

64 Q ∩ 65

(38) (cid:12)(cid:12)∂β (FQ − FQ′)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ CMδm−|β|

Q

equal to 1, hence δQ ≥ 1

on 65

64 Q ∩ 65

64 Q′ for |β| ≤ m.

To see this, suppose ﬁrst that Q or Q′ is of Type 3. Then δQ or δQ′ is

2 by (34). Consequently, (38) asserts simply that

10

(39) (cid:12)(cid:12)∂β (FQ − FQ′)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ CM on 65

64 Q ∩ 65

64 Q′ for |β| ≤ m,

and (39) follows at once from (35), (36). Thus, (38) holds if Q or Q′ is of
Type 3. Suppose that neither Q nor Q′ is of Type 3. Then xQ ∈ E ∩ 5Q+,
xQ′ ∈ E ∩ 5(Q′+), 65

2 δQ ≤ δQ′ ≤ 2δQ. Consequently,

64 Q′ 6= ∅, 1

64 Q ∩ 65

(40) |xQ − xQ′| ≤ CδQ, and

(41) |x − xQ|, |x − xQ′| ≤ CδQ for all x ∈ 65

64 Q ∩ 65

64 Q′.

Applying (35) to Q and to Q′, we ﬁnd that

(42) (cid:12)(cid:12)∂β (FQ − PxQ) (x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ CM |x − xQ|m−|β| ≤ CMδm−|β|
(43) (cid:12)(cid:12)∂β (FQ′ − PxQ′ ) (x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ CM |x − xQ′|m−|β| ≤ CMδm−|β|

for x ∈ 65

64 Q′, |β| ≤ m.
Also, (30), (40), (41) imply that

64 Q ∩ 65

Q

,

, and

Q

(44) (cid:12)(cid:12)∂β (PxQ − PxQ′ ) (x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ CMδm−|β|

Q

(Recall, PxQ − PxQ′ is a polynomial of degree at most m − 1.)
Estimates (42), (43), (44) together imply (38) in case neither Q nor Q′

for x ∈ 65

64 Q ∩ 65

64 Q′, |β| ≤ m.

is of Type 3. Thus, (38) holds in all cases.

Next, as in Whitney [33], we introduce a partition of unity

(45) 1 =PQ∈CZ θQ on Rn,

where each θQ ∈ Cm(Rn), and

(46) support θQ ⊂ 65

Q for |β| ≤ m, θQ ≥ 0 on Rn.

We deﬁne

64 Q, (cid:12)(cid:12)∂βθQ(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Cδ−|β|

(47) F =PQ∈CZ θQFQ on Rn.

Thus, F ∈ Cm

loc(Rn) since CZ is a locally ﬁnite partition of Rn, and F ≥ 0
on Rn since θQ ≥ 0 and FQ ≥ 0 for each Q. Let ^x ∈ Rn, and let ^Q be the
one and only CZ cube containing ^x. Then for |β| ≤ m, we have

11

(48) ∂βF (^x) = ∂βF ^Q (^x) +PQ∈CZ ∂β(cid:0)θQ ·(cid:0)FQ − F ^Q(cid:1)(cid:1) (^x).

A given Q ∈ CZ enters into the sum in (48) only if ^x ∈ 65

64 Q; there are
at most C such cubes Q, thanks to (34). Moreover, for each Q ∈ CZ with
^x ∈ 65

64 Q, we learn from (38) and (46) that

Q

≤ CM for |β| ≤ m, since δQ ≤ 1.

(cid:12)(cid:12)∂β(cid:0)θQ ·(cid:0)FQ − F ^Q(cid:1)(cid:1) (^x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ CMδm−|β|
Since also (cid:12)(cid:12)∂βF ^Q (^x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ CM for |β| ≤ m by (35), (36), it now follows from
(48) that (cid:12)(cid:12)∂βF (^x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ CM for all |β| ≤ m. Here, ^x ∈ Rn is arbitrary. Thus,

Next, let x ∈ E. For any Q ∈ CZ such that x ∈ 65

F ∈ Cm (Rn) and ||F||Cm(Rn) ≤ CM.

64 Q, we have Jx(FQ) = Px,
64 Q for each Q ∈ CZ, it follows that Jx(θQFQ) =

by (37). Since support θQ ⊂ 65
Jx(θQ) ⊙x Px for each Q ∈ CZ, and consequently,

Jx(F) = XQ∈CZ

Jx (θQFQ) ="XQ∈CZ

Jx (θQ)# ⊙x Px = Px, by (45).

Thus, F ∈ Cm (Rn), kFkCm(Rn) ≤ CM, F ≥ 0 on Rn, and Jx (F) = Px for each
x ∈ E.

The proof of Lemma 2 is complete.

Theorem 3 (Finiteness Principle for Nonnegative Cm Interpolation)
There exist constants k#, C, depending only on m, n, such that the following
holds.

Let E ⊂ Rn be ﬁnite, and let f : E → [0,∞). Let M0 > 0. Suppose that
for each S ⊂ E with #(S) ≤ k#, there exists ~PS = (Px)x∈S ∈ Wh(S) such that

• Px ∈ Γf(x, M0) for each x ∈ S, and

• |∂β(Px − Py)(x)| ≤ M0|x − y|m−|β| for x, y ∈ S, |β| ≤ m − 1.

Then there exists F ∈ Cm(Rn) such that

• kFkCm(Rn) ≤ CM0,

• F ≥ 0 on Rn, and

• F = f on E.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that E ⊂ 1
Pick any x0 ∈ E. (If E is empty, our theorem holds trivially.)

2 Q0 for a cube Q0 of sidelength δQ0 = 1.

Let S ⊂ E with #(S) ≤ k#.
Our present hypotheses supply the Whitney ﬁeld ~PS required in the hy-

potheses of Theorem 2.

Hence, recalling Lemma 1 and applying Theorem 2, we obtain

(49) P0 ∈ Γf(x0, CM0)

and

(50) F0 ∈ Cm(Q0)

such that

(51) Jx(F0) ∈ Γf(x, CM0) for all x ∈ E ∩ Q0 = E

and

(52) |∂β(P0 − F0)| ≤ CM0 on Q0, for |β| ≤ m.

From (1), (2), (49), we have |∂βP0(x0)| ≤ CM0 for |β| ≤ m − 1.
Since P0 is a polynomial of degree at most m − 1, and since x0 ∈ E ⊂ Q0

with δQ0 = 1, it follows that |∂βP0| ≤ CM0 on Q0 for |β| ≤ m.

Together with (52), this tells us that

(53) |∂βF0| ≤ CM0 on Q0 for |β| ≤ m.

Note that F0 needn’t be nonnegative.
Set Px = Jx(F0) for x ∈ E. Then

(54) Px ∈ Γf (x, CM0) for x ∈ E, and

(55) (cid:12)(cid:12)∂β (Px − Py) (x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ CM0 |x − y|m−|β| for x, y ∈ E, |β| ≤ m − 1.

By Lemma 2, there exists F ∈ Cm (Rn) such that

(56) kFkCm(Rn) ≤ CM0,

(57) F ≥ 0 on Rn, and

13

(58) Jx (F) = Px for each x ∈ E.

From (54) and (2), we have Px(x) = f(x) for each x ∈ E; hence, (58)

implies that

(59) F (x) = f (x) for each x ∈ E.

Our results (56), (57), (59) are the conclusions of our theorem. Thus, we

have proven Theorem 3 in the case in which E ⊂ 1

2 Q0 with δQ0 = 1.

To pass to the general case (arbitrary ﬁnite E ⊂ Rn), we set up a partition

of unity 1 = Pν χν on Rn, where each χν ∈ Cm(Rn) and χν ≥ 0 on Rn,

2 Qν, with δQν = 1, and with any given point

kχνkCm(Rn) ≤ C, support χν ⊂ 1
of Rn belonging to at most C of the Qν.

For each ν, we apply the known special case of our theorem to the set
2 Qν and the function fν = f|Eν. Thus, we obtain Fν ∈ Cm(Rn),

Eν = E ∩ 1
with kFνkCm(Rn) ≤ CM0, Fν ≥ 0 on Rn, and Fν = f on E ∩ 1

2 Qν.

Setting F = Pν χνFν ∈ Cm

kFkCm(Rn) ≤ CM0, F ≥ 0 on Rn, and F = f on E.

loc(Rn), we verify easily that F ∈ Cm(Rn),

This completes the proof of Theorem 3.

Remark Conversely, we make the following trivial observation: Let E ⊂ Rn

be ﬁnite, let f : E → [0,∞), and let M0 > 0. Suppose F ∈ Cm(Rn) satisﬁes

kFkCm(Rn) ≤ M0, F ≥ 0 on Rn, F = f on E. Then for each x ∈ E, we have

• Px = Jx(F) ∈ Γf(x, M0) by (1), (2); and

• |∂β(Px − Py)(x)| ≤ CM0|x − y|m−|β| for x, y ∈ E, |β| ≤ m − 1.

Therefore, for any S ⊂ E, the Whitney ﬁeld ~PS = (Px)x∈S ∈ Wh(S)

satisﬁes

• Px ∈ Γf(x, CM0) for x ∈ S, and

• |∂β(Px − Py)(x)| ≤ CM0|x − y|m−|β| for x, y ∈ S, |β| ≤ m − 1.

Note that Theorem 1 (A) follows easily from Theorem 3.

3 Computable Convex Sets

In this section, we discuss computational issues regarding the convex set

(1) Γ∗ (x, M) =(cid:10)Jx (F) : F ∈ Cm (Rn) , kFkCm(Rn) ≤ M, F ≥ 0 on Rn(cid:11) .

We write c, C, C′, etc., to denote constants determined by m and n.

These symbols may denote diﬀerent constants in diﬀerent occurrences.

We will deﬁne convex sets ˜Γ∗(x, M) ⊂ P, prove that
(2) ˜Γ∗(x, cM) ⊂ Γ∗ (x, M) ⊂ ˜Γ∗(x, CM) for all x ∈ Rn, M > 0,
and explain how (in principle) one can compute ˜Γ∗(x, M).
We may then use
(3) ˜Γf (x, M) =(cid:10)P ∈ ˜Γ∗(x, M) : P (x) = f (x)(cid:11)

in place of Γf(x, M) in the statement of Theorem 3. (The assertion in terms
of ˜Γf follows trivially from (2) and the original assertion in terms of Γf.)

To achieve (2), we will deﬁne

(4) ˜Γ∗(x, M) =(cid:10)MP (· + x)) : P ∈ ˜Γ0(cid:11), for a convex set ˜Γ0.

We will prove that

(5) Γ∗(0, c) ⊂ ˜Γ0 ⊂ Γ∗(0, C).
Property (2) then follows at once from (1), (4), and (5).
Thus, our task is to deﬁne a convex set ˜Γ0 satisfying (5), and explain how

(in principle) one can compute ˜Γ0.

Recall that P is the vector space of (m − 1)-jets. We will work in the
space of m-jets. In this section, we let P + denote the vector space of real-
valued polynomials of degree at most m on Rn, and we write J+
x (F) to denote
the mth-degree Taylor polynomial of F at x, i.e.,

J+

x (F) (y) = X|α|≤m

(∂αF (x)) · (y − x)α .

We deﬁne

P ∈ P + :(cid:12)(cid:12)∂βP (0)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ 1 for |β| ≤ m; P (x) + |x|m ≥ 0 for all x ∈ Rn;

and for every ǫ > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that

P (x) + ǫ |x|m ≥ 0 for |x| ≤ δ.

Later, we will discuss how Γ +
We next establish the following result.

0 may be computed in principle.

Lemma 3 For small enough c and large enough C, the following hold.

(A) If F ∈ Cm(Rn), kFkCm(Rn) ≤ c, F ≥ 0 on Rn, then J+

0 (F) ∈ Γ +
0 .

(B) If P ∈ Γ +

0 , then there exists F ∈ Cm(Rn) such that kFkCm(Rn) ≤ C, F ≥ 0

on Rn, and J+

0 (F) = P.

Proof. (A) follows trivially from Taylor’s theorem. We prove (B).

Let P ∈ Γ +

0 be given. We introduce cutoﬀ functions ϕ, χ ∈ Cm (Rn) with

the following properties.

(7) kχkCm(Rn) ≤ C, χ = 1 in a neighborhood of 0, χ = 0 outside Bn (0, 1/2),

and 0 ≤ χ ≤ 1 on Rn.

(8) kϕkCm(Rn) ≤ C, ϕ = 1 for 1/2 ≤ |x| ≤ 2, ϕ ≥ 0 on Rn,

and ϕ (x) = 0 unless 1/4 < |x| < 4.

For k ≥ 0, let

(9) ϕk (x) = ϕ(cid:0)2kx(cid:1) (x ∈ Rn).

Thus,

(10) kϕkkCm(Rn) ≤ C2mk, ϕk ≥ 0 on Rn, ϕk (x) = 1 for 2−1−k ≤ |x| ≤ 21−k,

ϕk (x) = 0 unless 2−2−k ≤ |x| ≤ 22−k.

Also, for k ≥ 0, we deﬁne a real number bk as follows.

(11) bk = 0 if P (x) ≥ 0 for |x| ≤ 2−k; bk = − min(cid:8)P (x) : |x| ≤ 2−k(cid:9) other-

wise.

Since P ∈ Γ +

0 , the bk satisfy the following:

(12) 0 ≤ bk ≤ 2−mk for all k ≥ 0.

16

(13) bk · 2mk

→ 0 as k→∞.

By deﬁnition of the bk, we have also for each k ≥ 0 that

(14) P (x) + bk ≥ 0 for |x| ≤ 2−k.

We deﬁne a function ˜F on the closed unit ball Bn(0, 1) by setting

(15) ˜F (x) = P (x) +P∞

k=0 bkϕk (x) for x ∈ Bn (0, 1).

(The sum contains at most C nonzero terms for any given x.)

We will check that

(16) ˜F ≥ 0 on Bn (0, 1).

Indeed, ˜F (0) = P(0) ≥ 0 since each ϕk(0) = 0 and P ∈ Γ +

0 . For ^x ∈

Bn(0, 1) \ {0} we have 2−1−^k ≤ |^x| ≤ 2−^k for some ^k ≥ 0.

We then have ϕ^k(^x) = 1 by (10), hence P(^x) + b^kϕ^k(^x) ≥ 0 by (14).

Since also bkϕk(^x) ≥ 0 for all k, it follows that

˜F(^x) = [P (^x) + b^kϕ^k (^x)] +Xk6=^k

bkϕk (x) ≥ 0,

completing the proof of (16).

Next, we check that

˜F(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)Cm(Bn(0,1))

≤ C, J+

0 (cid:16)˜F(cid:17) = P.

(17) ˜F ∈ Cm(cid:16)Bn (0, 1)(cid:17), (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)
(18) ˜FK = P +PK

To see this, let

Since P ∈ Γ +

k=0 bkϕk for K ≥ 0.

(19) kPkCm(Bn(0,1)) ≤ C.

0 , we have (cid:12)(cid:12)∂βP (0)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ 1 for |β| ≤ m, hence

Also, (10) and (12) give

kbkϕkkCm(Bn(0,1)) ≤ C for each k.

Since any given x ∈ Bn(0, 1) belongs to at most C of the supports of the

ϕk, it follows that

From (18), (19), (20), we see that

(20) (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)PK
k=0 bkϕk(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)Cm(Bn(0,1))
(21) ˜FK ∈ Cm(cid:16)Bn (0, 1)(cid:17) and (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)
0 (cid:16)˜FK(cid:17) = P for each K.
Furthermore for K1 < K2, (18) gives ˜FK2 − ˜FK1 = PK1<k≤K2

˜F(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)Cm(Bn(0,1))

Also, (10) and (18) tell us that

ǫ > 0. From (10) and (13) we see that

(22) J+

bkϕk. Let

K1<k≤K2

kbkϕkkCm(Bn(0,1)) < ǫ if K1 is large enough.

Since any given point lies in support ϕk for at most C distinct k, it follows
that

bkϕk(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)Cm(Bn(0,1))

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)
XK1<k≤K2
Thus, (˜FK)K≥0 is a Cauchy sequence in Cm(Bn(0, 1)). Consequently, ˜FK →

˜F∞ in Cm(Bn(0, 1))-norm for some ˜F∞ ∈ Cm(Bn(0, 1)). From (21) and (22),
we have

≤ C and J+

0 (cid:16)˜F∞(cid:17) = P.

On the other hand, comparing (15) to (18), and recalling that any given
˜F

˜F∞(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)Cm(Bn(0,1))
(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)
x belongs to support θk for at most C distinct k, we conclude that ˜FK →

Since also ˜FK →
Thus, ˜F ∈ Cm(cid:16)Bn (0, 1)(cid:17), (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)
0 (cid:16)˜F(cid:17) = P, complet-

˜F∞ pointwise as K→∞, we have ˜F∞ = ˜F.

Finally, we recall the cutoﬀ function χ from (7), and deﬁne F = χ˜F on

From (16), (17), and the properties (7) of χ, we conclude that F ∈

Cm (Rn), kFkCm(Rn) ≤ C, F ≥ 0 on Rn, and J+

0 (F) = P.

Thus, we have established (B).
The proof of Lemma 3 is complete.
Now let π : P +

→ P denote the natural projection from m-jets at 0 to

(m − 1)-jets at 0, namely, πP = J0 (P) for P ∈ P +.

We then set ˜Γ0 = πΓ +
0 .
From the above lemma, we learn the following.

(A′) Let F ∈ Cm (Rn) with kFkCm(Rn) ≤ c, F ≥ 0 on Rn. Then J0 (F) ∈ ˜Γ0.

(B′) Let P ∈ ˜Γ0. Then there exists F ∈ Cm (Rn) such that kFkCm(Rn) ≤ C,

F ≥ 0 on Rn, and J0 (F) = P.

˜Γ0 ⊂ Γ∗ (0, C).

Recalling the deﬁnition (1), we conclude from (A′), (B′) that Γ∗ (0, c) ⊂
Thus, our ˜Γ0 satisﬁes the key condition (5).
We discuss brieﬂy how the convex set ˜Γ0 may be computed in principle.
Recall [20] that a semialgebraic set is a subset of a vector space obtained
by taking ﬁnitely many unions, intersections, and complements of sets of the
form {P > 0} for polynomials P. Any subset of a vector space V deﬁned by E =
{x ∈ V : Φ (x) is true}, where Φ is a formula of ﬁrst-order predicate calculus
(for the theory of real-closed ﬁelds) is semialgebraic; moreover, there is an
algorithm that accepts Φ as input and exhibits E as a Boolean combination
of sets of the form {P > 0} for polynomials P. For any given m, n, we see,
by inspection of the deﬁnitions of Γ +
0 ⊂ P + is deﬁned by a
formula of ﬁrst-order predicate calculus; hence, the same holds for ˜Γ0 ⊂ P.
Therefore, in principle, we can compute ˜Γ0 as a Boolean combination of

0 and ˜Γ0, that Γ +

sets of the form {P ∈ P : Π (P) > 0}, where Π is a polynomial on P.
In practice, we make no claim that we know how to compute ˜Γ0.
It would be interesting to give a more practical method to compute a

convex set satisfying (5).

4 Cm−1,1 Interpolation by Nonnegative Func-

tions

In this section we will establish Theorem 1 (B) and discuss computational
issues for Cm−1,1 interpolation by nonnegative functions.

19

We note that the derivatives ∂βF of F ∈ Cm−1,1 (Rn) of order |β| ≤ m − 1

are continuous. Also, Taylor’s theorem holds in the form

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
∂βF (y) − X|β|+|γ|≤m−1

for x, y ∈ Rn.

γ!(cid:2)∂γ+βF (x)(cid:3) · (y − x)γ(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

≤ C kFkCm−1,1(Rn) · |y − x|m−|β|

Similar remarks apply to Cm−1,1 (Q) and Cm (Q) for cubes Q ⊂ Rn.
Therefore, we may repeat the proofs [18] of Lemmas 1 and 2 in Section

2, to derive the following results.

Lemma 4 For x ∈ Rn, M > 0, let

Γ ′
∗

(x, M) =(cid:12)

P ∈ P : ∃F ∈ Cm−1,1 (Rn) such that

kFkCm−1,1(Rn) ≤ M, F ≥ 0 on Rn, Jx (F) = P (cid:13) .
Let f : E→ [0,∞), where E ⊂ Rn is ﬁnite. For x ∈ E, M > 0, let
Then ~Γ ′f := (Γ ′f (x, M))x∈E,M>0 is a (C, 1)-convex shape ﬁeld, where C depends
only on m, n.

Γ ′f (x, M) = {P ∈ Γ ′
∗

(x, M) : P (x) = f (x)} .

(x, M) be as in Lemma 4, and let M > 0, ~P =
(x, M) for all x ∈ E, and

Lemma 5 Let E, f, Γ ′

exists F ∈ Cm−1,1 (Rn) such that Jx (F) = Px for all x ∈ E, and kFkCm−1,1(Rn) ≤
CM, where C depends only on m, n.

(cid:12)(cid:12)∂β (Px − Py) (x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ M |x − y|m−|β| for x, y ∈ E, |β| ≤ m − 1. Then there

Similarly, by making small changes in the proof [18] of Theorem 3, we

obtain the following result.

Lemma 6 There exist k#, C, depending only on m, n for which the follow-
ing holds.

Let E ⊂ Rn be ﬁnite, let f : E → [0,∞), and let M0 > 0. Suppose that
for each S ⊂ E with # (S) ≤ k# there exists ~PS = (Px)x∈S ∈ Wh (S) such
that Px ∈ Γ ′f (x, M0) for all x ∈ S, and (cid:12)(cid:12)∂β (Px − Py)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ M0 |x − y|m−|β| for
x, y ∈ S, |β| ≤ m − 1.

Then there exists F ∈ Cm−1,1 (Rn) such that kFkCm−1,1(Rn) ≤ CM0, F ≥ 0

on Rn, and F = f on E.

20

Now we can easily deduce the following result.

Theorem 4 (Finiteness Principle for Nonnegative Cm−1,1-Interpolation)
There exists constants k#, C, depending only on m, n for which the following
holds.

Let f : E → [0,∞), with E ⊂ Rn arbitrary (not necessarily ﬁnite). Let
M0 > 0. Suppose that for each S ⊂ E with #(S) ≤ k# there exists ~P =
(Px)x∈S ∈ Wh(S) such that

• Px ∈ Γ ′f(x, M0) for all x ∈ S,

• (cid:12)(cid:12)∂β (Px − Py) (x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ M0 |x − y|m−|β| for x, y ∈ S, |β| ≤ m − 1.

Then there exists F ∈ Cm−1,1 (Rn) such that

• ||F||Cm−1,1(Rn) ≤ CM0,

• F ≥ 0, and

• F = f on E.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that E ⊂ Q for some cube Q ⊂ Rn. Then by Ascoli’s
theorem,

(cid:10)F ∈ Cm−1,1 (Q) : kFkCm−1,1(Q) ≤ CM0, F ≥ 0 on Q(cid:11) ≡ X

is compact in the Cm−1(Q)-norm topology.

For each ﬁnite E0 ⊂ E, Lemma 6 tells us that there exists F ∈ X such that

F = f on E0.

Consequently, there exists F ∈ X such that F = f on E. That is,

(1) F ∈ Cm−1,1 (Q), kFkCm−1,1(Q) ≤ CM0, F ≥ 0 on Q, F = f on E.

We have achieved (1), assuming that E ⊂ Q.
Now suppose E ⊂ Rn is arbitrary.

We introduce a partition of unity 1 = Pν θν on Rn, with θν ≥ 0 on Rn,

θν ∈ Cm (Rn), kθνkCm(Rn) ≤ C, support θν ⊂ Qν for a cube Qν ⊂ Rn, with
(say) δQν = 1, and such that any given x ∈ Rn has a neighborhood that
intersects at most C of the Qν. (Here C depends only on m, n.)

21

functions Fν ∈ Cm−1,1 (Qν) such that kFνkCm−1,1(Qν) ≤ CM0, Fν ≥ 0 on Qν,
Fν = f on E ∩ Qν.

Applying our result (1) to f|E∩Qν : E ∩ Qν → [0,∞) for each ν, we obtain
We deﬁne F = Pν θνFν on Rn. One checks easily that kFkCm−1,1(Rn) ≤

(Here C depends only on m, n.)

C′M0 with C′ determined by m, n; F ≥ 0 on Rn; and F = f on E.

This completes the proof of Theorem 4.
Note that Theorem 4 easily implies Theorem 1 (B).
As in the case of nonnegative Cm-interpolation, we want to replace Γ ′f(x, M)
by something easier to calculate. In the Cm−1,1-setting, it is enough to make
the following observation.

Deﬁne

Then

˜Γ ′0 =(cid:12) P ∈ P :(cid:12)(cid:12)∂βP (0)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ 1 for |β| ≤ m − 1 and

P (x) + |x|m ≥ 0 for all x ∈ Rn

(cid:13) .

(2) Γ ′
∗

(0, c) ⊂ ˜Γ ′0 ⊂ ˜Γ ′
∗

(0, C) with c, C depending only on m, n.

Indeed, the ﬁrst inclusion in (2) is immediate from the deﬁnitions and
Taylor’s theorem. To prove the second inclusion, we let P ∈ ˜Γ ′0 be given,
and set F(x) = χ(x)(P(x) + |x|m), where χ is a nonnegative Cm function with
norm at most C∗ (depending only on m, n), satisfying J0(χ) = 1 and support
χ ⊂ Bn(0, 1).
We then have F ∈ Cm−1,1(Rn), kFkCm−1,1(Rn) ≤ C (depending only on m,
(0, C), completing the proof of

n), F ≥ 0 on Rn, J0 (F) = P. Hence, P ∈ Γ ′
∗
(2).

This concludes our discussion of interpolation by nonnegative Cm−1,1 func-

tions.
