VORTEX GROUND STATES FOR KLEIN-GORDON-MAXWELL-PROCA

TYPE SYSTEMS

PIETRO D’AVENIA, JAROSŁAW MEDERSKI, AND ALESSIO POMPONIO

Abstract. We look for three dimensional vortex-solutions, which have ﬁnite energy and are
stationary solutions of Klein-Gordon-Maxwell-Proca type systems of equations. We prove the
existence of three dimensional cylindrically symmetric vortex-solutions having a least possible
energy among all symmetric solutions. Moreover we show that if the Proca mass disappears then
the solutions tends to a solution of the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell system.

1. Introduction

In the last years a wide literature has been devoted to gauge ﬁeld theories. In a gauge theory the
action is invariant under a continuous symmetry group that depends on spacetime. Gauge theories
are used to describe theoretically fundamental forces of nature as electromagnetism, weak force and
strong force and their interaction with matter ﬁeld. These models are also veriﬁed experimentally
with a high precision. Klein-Gordon-Maxwell type systems, in which we are interested, fall within
this framework. In this case, the starting point is the nonlinear Klein-Gordon Lagrangian density

(1.1)

LKG(ψ) =

1
2

[|∂tψ|2 − |∇ψ|2 − m2|ψ|2] + F (x, ψ),

where (t, x) ∈ R × R3, ψ : R × R3 → C represents the matter ﬁeld, m is a constant (the mass of ψ)
and F : R3 × C → R is a nonlinearity, which can represent the interaction among many particles,
such that F (x, 0) = 0 and F (x, ψ) = F (x, |ψ|).
To study the interaction of the ﬁeld ψ with its own electromagnetic ﬁeld, whose gauge potential
is given by (φ, A) (φ : R × R3 → R and A : R × R3 → R3 are respectively the electric and the
magnetic potentials), it is usual to consider the gauge covariant derivatives instead of the classical
ones, replacing in (1.1) the time derivative ∂t and the spatial derivatives ∇ respectively with ∂t+iqφ
and ∇ − iqA, where q is a coupling constant (see [16, 22, 23]). Thus we get

˜LKG(ψ, φ, A) =

1

2(cid:2)|∂tψ + iqφψ|2 − |∇ψ − iqAψ|2 − m2|ψ|2(cid:3) + F (x, ψ).

To this Lagrangian density we have to add the electromagnetic one in the vacuum. In this paper
we consider the Maxwell and Maxwell-Proca Lagrangian densities

The Maxwell-Proca Lagrangian density is a massive version of the Maxwell one and coincides with
it if µ = 0. This model was introduced by Alexandre Proca (see [24–28]) under the de Broglie

inﬂuence as a generalization of the Maxwell’s one. The mass term is due to the eﬀects of a photon
rest mass (which can be small but still nonzero) and the invariance of electrodynamics under
transformations of special relativity is preserved (see [18] and references therein for more details).
Hence the total Lagrangian density is given by

and the Euler-Lagrange equations of the total action

in R × R3.

A very interesting problem regarding system (1.2) is the existence of solitary wave solutions,
namely solutions whose ﬁnite energy travels as a localized packet. These solutions are strictly joint
with solitons, i.e. solitary waves that exhibit a very strong form of stability.

Starting from the pioneering paper [4], many papers have been devoted to the study of this
type of systems and, in particular, to the existence of stationary solutions of (1.2), i.e. solution
of the form ψ(t, x) = u(x)eiS(t,x), with u : R3 → R and S : R × R3 → R, especially in the purely
electrostatic case (φ = φ(x) and A = 0), with µ = 0. Existence and non-existence results, under
diﬀerent assumptions on the nonlinearity and on m and ω are present in [1, 10, 11], while the
existence of a ground state has been considered in [2, 30]. Moreover we mention [13, 14], for the
bounded domain case, and [9, 15, 17, 19, 20], for the case A = 0 and µ 6= 0 on manifolds. Finally
Klein-Gordon equations coupled with Born-Infeld type equations have been treated in [8, 12, 32].

In this paper, instead, we are interested in the electromagnetostatic case (nontrivial φ = φ(x)
and A = A(x)) which has been studied in a smaller number of articles (see [3, 5, 6]), only for
the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell system (µ = 0). In particular, from the physical point of view, it is
important to ﬁnd ground state solutions which are minimizers of the energy functional among a
set of nontrivial solutions and, in this work, we ﬁnd symmetric ground states for any µ ∈ R. Our
results are also new when µ = 0. Besides we investigate the behavior of solutions when the Proca
mass µ disappears.

These lists of literature, of course, are not complete and we refer to [7] and references therein

for a more exhaustive description.

When we look for stationary solutions, the total action S depends on the unknowns u, S, φ, A
and its Euler-Lagrange equations, in the particular case S(t, x) = S0(x) − ωt with ω ∈ R, φ = φ(x)
and A = A(x), are

−∆φ + µ2φ = q(ω − qφ)u2,
∇ × ∇ × A + µ2A = q(∇S0 − qA)u2,

in R3.

Observe that, for instance, considering ∇S0(x) 6= 0 a.e. in R3, we get that if A = 0, then the

unique solution of (1.3) is the trivial one and so the purely electrostatic case is meaningless.

If µ = 0, moreover, the second equation in (1.3) follows from the fourth one. If µ 6= 0, second
and fourth equation in (1.3) imply div A = 0. Thus, while in the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell system
(µ = 0) the natural constraint div A = 0 seems to be a technical requirement in order to avoid the

GROUND STATES FOR KGMP SYSTEMS

problems related to the curl-curl operator in the last equation of (1.3) (see e.g. [7]), in the Klein-
Gordon-Maxwell-Proca case (µ 6= 0) we need to require this property in order to get solutions.
Thus, system (1.3) is equivalent to

(1.4)

−∆u + [m2 − (ω − qφ)2]u + |∇S0 − qA|2u = ∂uF (x, u),
−∆φ + µ2φ = q(ω − qφ)u2,
∇ × ∇ × A + µ2A = q(∇S0 − qA)u2,

in R3,

with the additional constraint that div A = 0 if µ 6= 0. We will show (see Section 2) that, including
such a condition in our setting, we get a natural constraint and for this reason we can restrict to
consider system (1.4) for all µ ∈ R.

Hence, as e.g. in [5, 6], we set

(1.5)

and we consider the maps

Σ =(cid:8)(x1, x2, x3) ∈ R3 : x1 = x2 = 0(cid:9)

(1.6)

θ : R3 \ Σ → R/(2πZ),

θ(x1, x2, x3) = Im log(x1 + ix2),

and S0(x) = ℓθ(x), with ℓ ∈ Z \ {0}. Thus we look for vortex solutions ψ(t, x) = ei(ℓθ(x)−ωt)u(x) of
(1.2) and so (u, φ, A)’s that solve

in R3,

with the additional condition div A = 0 for µ 6= 0. In the following we refer to (Sµ) as Klein-
Gordon-Maxwell-Proca system if µ 6= 0, otherwise, as Klein-Gordon-Maxwell.

In particular, in this paper we are interested in the existence of symmetric ground state solutions
of (Sµ), namely solutions that minimize the energy on suitable Nehari-type manifolds (see Section
3 and Section 4 for more details): this kind of solutions are often a good starting point in order
to get solitons. We emphasize that, with respect to previous papers on this topic, we prove our
existence results for an arbitrary µ ∈ R, under general weak assumptions on the nonlinearity f ,
without any constraint on the L2-norm of u (the total charge) and with a nontrivial magnetostatic
potential A. Moreover, up to our knowledge, another novelty is the study of the behaviour of these
ground states as µ → 0 according to the physical meaning of such a parameter.

Let 0 < ω2 < m2 and assume that the function f : R3 × R → R satisﬁes:

x3, f (x, ·) continuous for a.e. x ∈ R3 and there are a > 0 and 2 < p < 6 = 2∗ such that

|f (x, s)| ≤ a(1 + |s|p−1),

(F2) f (x, s) = o(s) uniformly in x as |s| → 0;

(F3) F (x, s) > 0 for all s 6= 0 and a.e. x ∈ R3, where F (x, s) =R s

If (F1)-(F4) hold, then for every µ ∈ R, the system (Sµ) admits a symmetric ﬁnite energy ground
state solution (uµ, φµ, Aµ).

Observe that (F4) implies that s 7→ f (x, s)/|s|σ−1 is nondecreasing on (−∞, 0) and (0, +∞).
If σ ≥ 4 then (F4) can be weakened, in the spirit of [29], and we consider the following mono-

tonicity condition:

(F5) u 7→ f (x, u)/|u|3 is nondecreasing on (−∞, 0) and (0, +∞).

With this weaker assumption we have

Theorem 1.2. If (F1)–(F3) and (F5) hold, then for every µ ∈ R, the system (Sµ) admits a
symmetric ﬁnite energy ground state solution (uµ, φµ, Aµ).
Remark 1.3. Observe that both (F4) and (F5) imply f (·, s) = o(s) a.e. in R3 (we have respectively
that f (·, s) = O(sσ−1) and f (·, s) = O(s3)). Thus, if we have some uniformity with respect to
x ∈ R3, e.g.
if f does not depend on x, (F2) can be deleted. Moreover (F1)–(F3) and (F4),
respectively (F5), imply that p ≥ σ, respectively p ≥ 4 (see Lemma 2.8). Therefore, while in
Theorem 1.1 we can consider also p ∈ (2, 4), in Theorem 1.2 we need to require that p ≥ 4. On
the other hand, the assumptions on the nonlinearity f in Theorem 1.2 are weaker than in Theorem
1.1.

In this kind of problem the classical approach consists in considering a functional which depends
only on two variables, (u, A), since the second equations of (Sµ) is uniquely solved, ﬁxed u, (see
for example [7] and the references therein). In the assumptions of Theorem 1.1, the minimization
on the Nehari manifold of the two variable functional seems to fail, because it is not clear if the
Nehari manifold is a natural constraint. We overcome this diﬃculty by the following trick (that, up
to our knowledge, is used here for the ﬁrst time): we consider also the unique symmetric solution
of the third equation of (Sµ), for u ﬁxed, and then we minimize on the symmetric Nehari manifold
of a one variable functional. The classical approach, instead, works in the hypotheses of Theorem
1.2: even if we cannot minimize directly on the Nehari manifold of the two variable functional due
to the general assumptions on f , in particular the lack of an Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition, we
are able to ﬁnd a Mountain Pass solution and to show that it is actually a minimizer on the Nehari
manifold.

We emphasize, moreover, that our ground states are also least energy solutions among all cylin-

drically symmetric ones.

We conclude the paper analyzing the behavior of the symmetric ground state solutions found
in the previous theorems as µ goes to zero. We show, in particular, that these solutions tend to a
weak solution of the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell system (Sµ) with µ = 0; however we do not know if
this weak solution is again a ground state (see Section 5 for more details).

Theorem 1.4. Suppose that (F1)-(F3) hold and, additionally, assume (F4) or (F5). If (uµ, φµ, Aµ)
is a symmetric ﬁnite energy ground state solution of (Sµ) and µ → 0, then (uµ, φµ, Aµ) tends weakly
in H 1(R3) × D1,2(R3) × (D1,2(R3))3 and a.e. in R3 to a symmetric weak solution (u0, φ0, A0) of
the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell system (Sµ) with µ = 0.

Observe ﬁnally that, with slight modiﬁcations, we could consider the case ω = 0. In this situation

we are in the purely magnetostatic case, namely φ = 0.

In the following we denote by C, Ci positive constants which can change from line to line. If not

speciﬁed, all the integrals are evaluated on the whole R3.

In this section we give some properties on the variational structure of our problem and on

symmetries we consider in order to get the desired solutions of (Sµ).

In this section we want to introduce some useful properties of φu.

Lemma 2.2. The function Φ := u 7→ φu is of class C1 and for all v ∈ H 1(R3),
(2.1)
Proof. We proceed as in [10, Proposition 2.1]. So we deﬁne the map T : H 1(R3) × Hµ → Hµ such
that

Φ′(u)[v] = −2q(∆ − µ2 − q2u2)−1[(ω − qφu)uv].

T (u, φ) = q(∆ − µ2)−1[(ω − qφ)u2] + φ.

Simple calculations show that

and

∂uT (u, φ) = v ∈ H 1(R3) 7−→ 2q(∆ − µ2)−1[(ω − qφ)uv]

∂φT (u, φ) = ψ ∈ Hµ 7−→ −q2(∆ − µ2)−1[u2ψ] + ψ.

We have that ∂φT (u, φ) is invertible and that

(∂φT (u, φ))−1 = (∆ − µ2 − q2u2)−1 ◦ (∆ − µ2).

6

Thus, by Implicit Function Theorem, we conclude.

(cid:3)

Moreover we have the following further useful properties.

Lemma 2.3. Let u ∈ H 1(R3). Then φu satisﬁes

and there exists C > 0 such that

Moreover, ψu := Φ′(u)[u]/2 satisﬁes

(2.8)

−∆ψu + µ2ψu = q(ω − qφu − qψu)u2,

ωZ ψuu2 =Z (ω − qφu)φuu2,

0 ≤ ψu ≤ φu.

Proof. Fix u ∈ H 1(R3). Equation (2.2) is simply obtained multiplying the second equation of (Sµ)
by φu and integrating.

Let us prove that φu ≥ 0. Assume by contradiction that it is not true. Then let Γ =(cid:8)x ∈ R3 | φu ≤ 0(cid:9)

and (φu)− = min{φu, 0}. Multiplying by (φu)− the second equation of (Sµ) and integrating on Γ
we get

ZΓ

|∇φu|2 + µ2ZΓ

φ2

u = qωZΓ

φuu2 − q2ZΓ

and we reach a contradiction since the right hand side is negative and the left hand side is
positive. To prove that φu ≤ ω/q, assume by contradiction that it is not true and let Γ =

(cid:8)x ∈ R3 | ω − qφu ≤ 0(cid:9) and (ω − qφu)− = min{ω − qφu, 0}. Multiplying by (ω − qφu)− the second

equation of (Sµ) and integrating on Γ we get

−qZΓ

|∇φu|2 + µ2ZΓ

φu(ω − qφu) = qZΓ

(ω − qφu)2u2

and we reach again a contradiction since the left hand side is negative and the right hand side is
positive. Inequality (2.4) easily follows from (2.2) and (2.3) and, again by (2.2),

k∇φuk2

2 ≤ qωZ φuu2 ≤ qωkφuk6kuk2

12/5 ≤ C(k∇φuk2

so that (2.5) holds.
By (2.1) we have that

ψu = −q(∆ − µ2 − q2u2)−1[(ω − qφu)u2]

and so (2.6) easily follows.
Moreover, since φu solves the second equation in (Sµ) and by (2.6), we have

qZ (ω − qφu)ψuu2 =Z (−∆φu + µ2φu)ψu =Z (−∆ψu + µ2ψu)φu = qZ (ω − qφu − qψu)φuu2

GROUND STATES FOR KGMP SYSTEMS

and so (2.7).
To prove (2.8), we proceed as before. First, assume by contradiction that ψu is not positive and

let Γ =(cid:8)x ∈ R3 | ψu ≤ 0(cid:9) and (ψu)− = min{0, ψu}. Multiplying (2.6) by (ψu)− we have that
and we reach a contradiction. Then, if by contradiction Γ =(cid:8)x ∈ R3 | φu ≤ ψu(cid:9) 6= ∅, we consider

(ψu − φu)+ = max{0, ψu − φu}. Since, by (2.6) and the second equation in (Sµ),

(ω − qφu)ψuu2 − qZΓ

|∇ψu|2 + µ2ZΓ

|ψu|2 = qZΓ

|ψu|2u2 ≤ 0

ZΓ

−∆(ψu − φu) + µ2(ψu − φu) = −q2ψuu2,

multiplying by (ψu − φu)+ we have that

ZΓ

|∇(ψu − φu)|2 + µ2ZΓ

and we reach a contradiction.

|(ψu − φu)|2 = −q2ZΓ

(ψu − φu)ψuu2 ≤ 0

(cid:3)

So we can introduce the reduced functional

is a critical point of I.

2.3. Symmetries and natural constraint. If µ 6= 0 we could prove that, for ﬁxed u ∈ ˆH 1, there
exists a unique Au which solves the third equation of (Sµ), minimizing the functional

being K strictly convex and coercive on H(curl, µ, u). However, in such a way, we do not get any
information on div Au but, as observed in the Introduction, we are looking for solutions (u, φ, A),
with div A = 0. Moreover, if µ = 0, then kAkcurl,0,u does not deﬁne a norm, in general.

Hence, to avoid these diﬃculties, we consider the following symmetric setting similarly as in [5,6],

where the case µ = 0 has been considered for diﬀerent types of nonlinearities.

Let us consider functions that are cylindrically symmetric, namely which depend only on the
cylindrical coordinates (r, x3) and let us denote with (C ∞
0 (R3 \ Σ))♯,
the subspace of cylindrically symmetric test functions in R3, respectively in R3 \ Σ (Σ is deﬁned
0 (R3))♯ with respect to the H 1(R3)-norm and,
in (1.5)). Moreover let H 1
analogously, we deﬁne (Hµ)♯ and ˆH 1
♯ .
Observe that if u ∈ H 1
div A = 0, we consider the set

♯ (R3), then φu ∈ (Hµ)♯. Moreover, since we are looking for solutions with

Lemma 2.4. For every A ∈ A we have that div A = 0, k∇ × Ak2 = k∇Ak2, and so ∇ × ∇ × A =

Thus we consider

equipped with the product norm. Note that A ⊂ (Hµ)3.

V := ˆH 1

In the next lemma we prove that V is a natural constraint and so we can reduce to look for
critical points of J on V . Note that Lemma 2.4 implies that the critical points on V satisfy
div A = 0, which is the additional condition that arises when we pass from system (1.3) to (Sµ)
in the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell-Proca case (µ 6= 0). Therefore if (u, A) ∈ V is a critical point of J,
then (u, φu, A) is a solution of (Sµ) for an arbitrary (ﬁxed) value of µ ∈ R.
Lemma 2.5. Let (u, A) ∈ V . If ∂uJ(u, A)[v] = 0 for any v ∈ ˆH 1
∂AJ(u, A)[B] = 0 for any B ∈ A, then ∂AJ(u, A) = 0.
Proof. We argue similarly as in [5, Theorem 16]. Suppose that ∂uJ(u, A)[v] = 0 for any v ∈ ˆH 1
♯
and let

♯ , then ∂uJ(u, A) = 0 and if

η = −∆u + [m2 − (ω − qφu)2]u + |ℓ∇θ − qA|2u − f (x, u).

Take any v ∈ ˆH 1 and let v = v1 + v2, where v1 ∈ ˆH 1

♯ )⊥. Then
∂uJ(u, A)[v] = hη, vi = ∂uJ(u, A)[v1] + hη, v2i = hη, v2i.

♯ and v2 ∈ ( ˆH 1

Since u, φu, |ℓ∇θ−qA|2, and f are cylindrically symmetric, then by the density argument η ∈ ( ˆH 1
♯ )′
and

∂uJ(u, A)[v] = 0.

Similarly we suppose that ∂AJ(u, A)[B] = 0 for any B ∈ A and let
ξ = −∆A + µ2A − q(ℓ∇θ − qA)u2.

Take any B ∈ (Hµ)3 and let B = B1 + B2, where B1 ∈ A and B2 ∈ A⊥. Then
∂AJ(u, A)[B] = hξ, Bi = ∂AJ(u, A)[B1] + hξ, B2i = hξ, B2i.

Similarly as in [5, Lemma 12], by the density argument ξ ∈ A′ and

∂AJ(u, A)[B] = 0.

In this symmetric setting, we are able to prove the following result that holds true both for µ 6= 0

(cid:3)

and for µ = 0.
Lemma 2.6. For every u ∈ ˆH 1
(Sµ). Moreover we have

♯ there exists a unique Au ∈ A that solves the third equation of

Proof. Fix u ∈ ˆH 1
♯ . Let us consider the functional K, deﬁned in (2.10), on A. It is strictly convex
and coercive, hence there is a unique critical point, Au, of K. In view of Lemma 2.5 we get that
Au solves the third equation of (Sµ). Equation (2.11) and the ﬁrst two inequalities in (2.13) are
trivial. To conclude, it is enough to observe that

0 ≤ k∇ × Auk2

2 + µ2kAuk2

2 +Z |ℓ∇θ − qAu|2u2
= qZ (ℓ∇θ − qAu) · Auu2 +Z |ℓ∇θ − qAu|2u2
= ℓ2Z u2

r2 − ℓqZ ∇θ · Auu2.

(cid:3)

The following regularity result is useful in order to deal with a further reduced functional.

Lemma 2.7. The map A := u ∈ ˆH 1

♯ 7→ Au ∈ A is of class C1 and for all v ∈ ˆH 1
♯ ,

A ′(u)[v] = −2q(∆ − µ2 − q2u2)−1[(ℓ∇θ − qAu)uv].

Moreover, Ψu := A ′(u)[u]/2 satisﬁes

(2.14)

and so

(2.15)

Finally

(2.16)

− ∆Ψu + µ2Ψu = q(ℓ∇θ − qAu − qΨu)u2,

k∇Ψuk2

2 + µ2kΨuk2

2 + q2Z u2|Ψu|2 = qZ (ℓ∇θ − qAu) · Ψuu2 ≥ 0.

ℓZ ∇θ · Ψuu2 =Z (ℓ∇θ − qAu) · Auu2.

Proof. In the ﬁrst part we proceed as in Lemma 2.2. So we deﬁne the map T : ˆH 1
that

♯ × A → A such

T (u, A) = q(∆ − µ2)−1[(ℓ∇θ − qA)u2] + A.

Simple calculations show that

∂uT (u, A) = v ∈ ˆH 1

♯ 7−→ 2q(∆ − µ2)−1[(ℓ∇θ − qA)uv]

and

∂AT (u, A) = V ∈ A 7−→ −q2(∆ − µ2)−1[Vu2] + V.

We have that ∂AT (u, A) is invertible and that

(∂AT (u, A))−1 = (∆ − µ2 − q2u2)−1 ◦ (∆ − µ2).
Thus, by Implicit Function Theorem, A is of class C1 and, for all v ∈ ˆH 1
♯ ,
A ′(u)[v] = −2q(∆ − µ2 − q2u2)−1[(ℓ∇θ − qAu)uv];

so

namely Ψu satisﬁes (2.14). Moreover, since Au solves the third equation in (Sµ), by (2.14) we have

Ψu = −q(∆ − µ2 − q2u2)−1[(ℓ∇θ − qAu)u2],

qZ (ℓ∇θ−qAu)Ψuu2 =Z (−∆Au+µ2Au)Ψu =Z (−∆Ψu+µ2Ψu)Au = qZ (ℓ∇θ−qAu−qΨu)Auu2

and so (2.16).

2.4. The nonlinearity. We conclude this section, showing some useful properties on the nonlin-
earity f . First of all we observe that if f satisﬁes (F1) and (F2), then

(2.18)

∀ε > 0 ∃Cε > 0 such that for a.e. x ∈ R3 and ∀s ∈ R : |f (x, s)| ≤ ε|s| + Cε|s|p−1

and so, for all u ∈ H 1(R3),

(2.19)

and

2 + Cεkukp

2+Cεkukp
p.

Moreover we have

Lemma 2.8. If f satisﬁes (F1)–(F4), for a.e. x ∈ R3 we have

(2.21)

and

(2.22)

sf (x, s) ≥ σF (x, s) ≥ 0 for all s ∈ R

F (x, ts) ≥ F (x, s)tσ for all s ∈ R, t ≥ 1.

If f satisﬁes (F1)–(F3) and (F5), for a.e. x ∈ R3 we have

(2.23)

and

(2.24)

sf (x, s) ≥ 4F (x, s) ≥ 0 for all s ∈ R

F (x, ts) ≥ F (x, s)t4 for all s ∈ R, t ≥ 1.

Proof. It is easy to show that (F4) implies that s 7→ f (x, s)/|s|σ−1 is nondecreasing on (−∞, 0) and
(0, +∞) and so (2.21) holds. Moreover, since the function t > 0 7→ F (x, ts)/tσ is nondecreasing by
(2.21), we get (2.22). Finally (2.23) and (2.24) can be obtained in the same way.
(cid:3)

Remark 2.9. As in [5, Lemma 9], up to take f (s) = 0 for s < 0, we can show, using (2.3), that
the each solution (u, φu, A) of (Sµ) has u ≥ 0 a.e. in R3.

3. Minimizing on the Nehari manifold

In this section we assume that (F1)–(F4) hold and we look for minimizers of the reduced func-

tional J , deﬁned in (2.17), on its Nehari manifold

First we prove

N :=nu ∈ ˆH 1

♯ \ {0} : J ′(u)[u] = 0o .

Lemma 3.1. For any u ∈ ˆH 1

♯ \ {0} there exists ¯t > 0 such that ¯tu ∈ N and so N is nonempty.

Moreover we have

Lemma 3.2. There exists C > 0 such that for every u ∈ N , kukp ≥ C.

Proof. Let u ∈ N , then, using (2.3), we have

and using Sobolev inequality we conclude.

(cid:3)

We have also

Lemma 3.3. N is a natural constraint.

Proof. Let u ∈ N be a critical point of J |N , then there exists λ ∈ R such that

J ′(u) = λ∂u(J ′(u)[u]).

Our aim is to show that λ = 0. Since

0 = J ′(u)[u] = λ∂u(J ′(u)[u])[u],

12

a.e. in R3 and then, by (1.7) and Lemma 3.2, we conclude.

Now we can complete the proof.

Proof of Theorem 1.1 concluded. Let {un} ⊂ N be a minimizing sequence, i.e.

13

(cid:3)

lim
n

J (un) = inf
u∈N

J (u).

As a ﬁrst step, we want to prove that {un} is bounded in ˆH 1.
Arguing as in the proof of Lemma 3.4 we get that {un} is bounded in H 1(R3). Hence, we need to
prove the boundedness of {un} in ˆH 1. If we set An = Aun, by (2.20) we have

and so, if ε small enough, since {un} is bounded in H 1(R3) and, by (2.12), we get that {An} is
bounded in (Hµ)3 and so in (L6(R3))3. Moreover

and so, combining (3.2) with (3.1), we get the boundedness of {un} in ˆH 1, as desired.
By Lemma 3.2 and by the classical Lions Lemma [21, Lemma I.1], there are δ > 0 and a sequence
{zn} ⊂ Z3, such that

(3.3)

ZB1(zn)

|un(x)|2 ≥ δ

for any n. Let us consider the cylindrical group action G = O(2)×Id ⊂ O(3) on R3. Observe that in
the family {B1(gzn)}g∈G we ﬁnd an increasing number of disjoint balls when rn = |zn · (e1 + e2)| →
+∞, being {ei}i=1,2,3 the canonical basis of R3. Since {un} is bounded in L2(R3) and the functions
un are cylindrical symmetric, then, by (3.3) rn must be bounded and so, for suﬃciently large R > 0,

(3.4)

ZBR(z3

ne3)

|un(x)|2 ≥ δ

where z3
n is the third component of zn. Due also to (F1), the functional J is invariant with respect
to Z-translations in the x3-axis and so the sequence {un(· + z3
ne3)}, that we denote again {un}, is
still a minimizing sequence. Thus, in view of (3.4), we get that, up to a subsequence, un ⇀ u0 6= 0
in ˆH 1
♯ .
As a second step, we show that (u0, φu0 , Au0) is a solution of (Sµ).
Since N is a natural constraint, by [31, Theorem 8.5] we have that {un} is a Palais-Smale sequence
for J ((PS) sequence, for short) and J ′(un)[v] → 0 for any v ∈ ˆH 1

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

♯ . Then,
∂uI(un, φn, An)[v] → 0, for any v ∈ (C ∞
0 (R3 \ Σ))♯,
∂φI(un, φn, An)[w] = 0, for any w ∈ C ∞
0 (R3),
∂AI(un, φn, An)[V] = 0 for any V ∈ A∞
0 ,

14

P. D’AVENIA, J. MEDERSKI, AND A. POMPONIO

where φn = φun. Since {un} is bounded in ˆH 1, by Lemma 2.3, Lemma 2.6 and (3.2), also {φn}
and {An} are bounded respectively in Hµ and (Hµ)3. Thus there exist φ0 ∈ Hµ and A0 ∈ (Hµ)3
such that, up to a subsequence,

φn ⇀ φ0 weakly in Hµ,
An ⇀ A0 weakly in (Hµ)3.

Arguing as in [2, Lemma 2.7], the weak convergence of {un}, (3.6) and (3.7) imply

∂φI(u0, φ0, A0)[w] = 0 for any w ∈ C ∞
0 (R3),
∂AI(u0, φ0, A0)[V] = 0 for any V ∈ A∞
0 ,

and so, by the uniqueness results in Section 2, φ0 = φu0 and A0 = Au0. Moreover, by (3.5), we get

∂uI(u0, φ0, A0)[v] = 0 for any v ∈ (C ∞

0 (R3 \ Σ))♯.

Hence,

∂uJ(u0, Au0)[v] = ∂uI(u0, φ0, A0)[v] = 0 for any v ∈ (C ∞
∂AJ(u0, Au0)[V] = ∂AI(u0, φ0, A0)[V] = 0 for any V ∈ A∞
0 ,

0 (R3 \ Σ))♯,

and so, by Lemma 2.5, we have that (u0, φ0, A0) is a solution for (Sµ) and so u0 ∈ N .
Finally, to prove that u0 is a ground state, we observe that

4. A Mountain Pass approach

In this section we assume (F1)–(F3) and (F5). Note that, arguing as in Lemma 3.1, we can show
that N is nonempty. However, it may be not of class C1 and so the minimization technique from
Section 3 fails. Moreover, due to the nonlocal terms φu and Au it is not clear if for any u ∈ ˆH 1
♯
the map J attains its maximum on R+u at an unique point tu ∈ N with t ≥ 0. This is a crucial
property to prove that the Nehari manifold is a topological manifold homeomorphic to the unit
sphere, where the minimization techniques can be performed in the spirit of [29].

In order to overcome the above diﬃculties we introduce a larger constraint M and we intend to

apply the following variant of the Mountain Pass Theorem.

Lemma 4.1. Let X, Y be Banach spaces, J : X × Y → R is of class C1 and

M := {(u, v) ∈ (X \ {0}) × (Y \ {0})| ∂uJ(u, v)[u] = 0, ∂vJ(u, v)[v] = 0} 6= ∅.

Let us assume that J satisﬁes the following

(J1) there is ρ > 0 such that

inf

k(u,v)kX×Y =ρ

J > 0 = J(0, 0);

GROUND STATES FOR KGMP SYSTEMS

15

(J2) for any (u, v) ∈ M there is T > 0 such that k(T u, v)kX×Y > ρ and J(T u, v) < 0;
(J3) if (u, v) ∈ M then

J(u, v) ≥

max

(t,s)∈[0,+∞)×[0,1]

{J(tu, v), J(0, sv)}.

Then, if

we have that

(4.1)

Γ := {γ ∈ C([0, 1], X × Y ) : γ(0) = (0, 0), J(γ(1)) < 0, kγ(1)kX×Y > ρ} ,

0 < c := inf
γ∈Γ

max
t∈[0,1]

J(γ(t)) ≤ inf
M

J

and there is a (PS) sequence {(un, vn)} at level c.

Proof. Since J satisﬁes the assumptions of the classical Mountain Pass Theorem, then c > 0
and there is a (PS) sequence (un, vn) at level c. Let (u, v) ∈ M and take T > 0 such that
k(T u, v)kX×Y > ρ and J(T u, v) < 0. Let us consider a path

γ(t) =((0, 2tv)

(T (2t − 1)u, v)

0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2,
1/2 ≤ t ≤ 1.

c ≤ max
t∈[0,1]

J(γ(t)) ≤ J(u, v).

Then γ ∈ Γ and by (J3)

Therefore c ≤ infM J.

(cid:3)

We take X := ˆH 1

♯ , Y := A and below we show that in our case, the functional J deﬁned in (2.9)

satisﬁes (J1)–(J3) in Lemma 4.1 for

M = {(u, A) ∈ (X \ {0}) × (Y \ {0})| ∂uJ(u, A)[u] = 0, ∂AJ(u, A)[A] = 0}

Observe that if u ∈ N , then (u, Au) ∈ M; hence, arguing as in Lemma 3.1, M is nonempty as
well.

J(0, sA) ≤ J(0, A) ≤ J(u, A).

Now we prove the following results that will be useful to get Theorem 1.2.

Lemma 4.4. Every (PS) sequence for the functional J is bounded.

Proof. Let {(un, An)} be a (PS) sequence for the functional J, i.e.

and

J(un, An) → β

dJ(un, An) → 0 in V ′

as n → +∞. Using (2.23), we have that

4J(un, An) − ∂uJ(un, An)[un] = k∇unk2

2 + 2k∇ × Ank2

≥ k∇unk2

2 + (m2 − ω2)kunk2

2 + 2k∇ × Ank2

2 + 2µ2kAnk2
2.

On the other hand

4J(un, An) − ∂uJ(un, An)[un] ≤ 4β + 1 + on(1)qk∇unk2

2 + (m2 − ω2)kunk2
2.

Then

k∇unk2

2 + (m2 − ω2)kunk2

2 + 2k∇ × Ank2

2 + 2µ2kAnk2

2 ≤ 4β + 1 + on(1)qk∇unk2

2 + (m2 − ω2)kunk2
2

and so {un} is bounded in H 1(R3) and {An} is bounded in (Hµ)3. Then we can conclude arguing
as in the proof of Theorem 1.1.
(cid:3)

Lemma 4.5. If {(un, An)} is a (PS) sequence for J at level β > 0, then kunkp ≥ C > 0.

Proof. Take any (PS) sequence {(un, An)} at level β > 0. Assume by contradiction that un → 0
in Lp(R3). Then, the interpolation and Sobolev inequalities and the boundedness of the (PS)
sequences imply that un → 0 in Ls(R3) for all s ∈ [2, 6). Moreover, since ∂uJ(un, An)[un] = on(1),
{un} and {An} are bounded and by Hölder and Sobolev inequalities, (3.2), Lemma 2.3 and (2.18)
we have

∂uJ(un, An)[un] + q2Z φ2

nu2

n = on(1) + q2Z φ2

nu2

n ≤ on(1) + Ckunk2

2 = on(1)

and so un → 0 in ˆH 1. Moreover, since ∂AJ(un, An)[An] = on(1), arguing as before,

k∇ × Ank2

2 + µ2kAnk2

2 + q2Z |An|2u2

n = on(1) + qℓZ ∇θ · Anu2

n = on(1).

Hence (un, An) → (0, 0) in V and, by continuity, we get J(un, An) → 0 which contradicts the fact
that J(un, An) → β > 0.
(cid:3)

Thus we can conclude as follows.

18

P. D’AVENIA, J. MEDERSKI, AND A. POMPONIO

Proof of Theorem 1.2. In view of the previous lemmas given in this section, there exists {(un, An)},
a bounded (PS) sequence for the functional J at level c > 0, with c deﬁned as in (4.1), such that
kunkp ≥ C > 0. Arguing as in the proof of Theorem 1.1, we get that, up to a subsequence
un ⇀ u0 6= 0 in ˆH 1
♯ and An ⇀ A0 in A and we show that (u0, φu0, A0) is a nontrivial critical point
of I. Finally, we can conclude that (u0, A0) ∈ V is a nontrivial critical point of J in V . In view
of Lemma 2.5 and Proposition 2.1, (u0, φu0, A0) is a solution of (Sµ) with u0 6= 0, φu0 6= 0 and
A0 6= 0. Observe that

c + on(1) = J(un, An)

5. The behaviour as µ → 0

In this section we assume that |µ| ≤ 1, F satisﬁes (F1)-(F3) and, additionally, (F4) or (F5),
and by the subscript or the superscript µ we denote the dependence on µ of functions, sets and
functionals deﬁned and used before. For µ 6= 0, the norms of Vµ’s are equivalent and so Vµ = V1.
Moreover we have V1 ⊂ V0.

Proof of Theorem 1.4. Let µ 6= 0. Note that

where K is deﬁned in (2.10). Hence, by (2.3) and the above inequality we have

Kµ(Aµ

Let uµ be a ground state of Jµ and ﬁx u0 6= 0. By Lemma 3.1 we ﬁnd tµ > 0 such that tµu0 ∈ Nµ
and, using (2.22) if f satisﬁes (F4), respectively (2.24) if f satisﬁes (F5), we have

u) ≤ 0.

0 < Jµ(uµ) ≤ Jµ(tµu0) ≤ sup

˜J (tu0) < +∞.

t∈[0,+∞)

Therefore {Jµ(uµ)} is bounded. Moreover arguing as in the proof of Theorem 1.1, we infer that
{uµ} is bounded in ˆH 1 and {Aµ

and so, as in the proof of Theorem 1.1, we ﬁnd a family {yµ} ⊂ Z such that, denoting again uµ
the function uµ(· + yµe3), we have that

uµ ⇀ u0 6= 0 in ˆH 1

Since, by Lemma 2.3, {φµ
uµ} is bounded also in D1,2(R3),
uµ ⇀ φ0 in D1,2(R3) and Aµ

uµ ⇀ A0 in (D1,2(R3))3

as µ → 0 for some φ0 ∈ (D1,2(R3))♯ and A0 ∈ A0. Then, since for every µ 6= 0

Remark 5.1. We are not able to say if such limit solution (u0, φ0
u0) is a ground state for (Sµ)
with µ 6= 0. One of the main diﬃculties is that, in general, it is not clear if, for a ﬁxed u ∈ ˆH 1

the map µ 7→ Jµ(u) is increasing or not. In fact, if we write

but, in (5.1), they appear with the opposite sign.

Remark 5.2. Observe that we can get a similar result as in Theorem 1.4, for any family {(uµ, φµ, Aµ)}
of solutions of (Sµ) such that {Iµ(uµ, φµ, Aµ)} is bounded above.
