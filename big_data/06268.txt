Abstract Since twenty years, a large population of close-in planets orbiting various classes
of low-mass stars (from M-type to A-type stars) has been discovered. In such systems, the
dissipation of the kinetic energy of tidal ﬂows in the host star may modify its rotational
evolution and shape the orbital architecture of the surrounding planetary system. In this
context, recent observational and theoretical works demonstrated that the amplitude of this
dissipation can vary over several orders of magnitude as a function of stellar mass, age and
rotation. In addition, stellar spin-up occurring during the Pre-Main-Sequence (PMS) phase
because of the contraction of stars and their spin-down because of the torque applied by
magnetized stellar winds strongly impact angular momentum exchanges within star-planet
systems. Therefore, it is now necessary to take into account the structural and rotational
evolution of stars when studying the orbital evolution of close-in planets. At the same time,
the presence of planets may modify the rotational dynamics of the host stars and as a conse-
quence their evolution, magnetic activity and mixing. In this work, we present the ﬁrst study
of the dynamics of close-in planets of various masses orbiting low-mass stars (from 0.6 M(cid:12)
to 1.2 M(cid:12)) where we compute the simultaneous evolution of the star’s structure, rotation
and tidal dissipation in its external convective enveloppe. We demonstrate that tidal friction
due to the stellar dynamical tide, i.e. tidal inertial waves excited in the convection zone,
can be larger by several orders of magnitude than the one of the equilibrium tide currently
used in celestial mechanics, especially during the PMS phase. Moreover, because of this
stronger tidal friction in the star, the orbital migration of the planet is now more pronounced
and depends more on the stellar mass, rotation and age. This would very weakly aﬀect the
planets in the habitable zone because they are located at orbital distances such that stellar
tide-induced migration happens on very long timescales. We also demonstrate that the rota-
tional evolution of host stars is only weakly aﬀected by the presence of planets except for
massive companions.

1 Introduction

The discovery twenty years ago of the ﬁrst hot Jupiter 51 Peg close to its host star (Mayor
& Queloz, 1995) opened the path to the detection and characterization of more than 1600
conﬁrmed exoplanetary systems, which have a large diversity of host stars (from M to A
type-stars), orbital architecture and planetary types (e.g. Perryman, 2011; Fabrycky et al.,
2014). Among them, a large population of systems are constituted by planets orbiting very
close to their host stars as this is the case for example for hot Jupiters (e.g. Mayor & Queloz,
1995; Henry et al., 2000; Charbonneau et al., 2000) and other compact planetary systems
(e.g. Fang & Margot, 2012; Fabrycky et al., 2014). In those conﬁgurations, tidal dissipation
inside the host stars may strongly aﬀects surrounding planetary orbits (Jackson et al., 2008;
Husnoo et al., 2012; Lai, 2012; Guillot et al., 2014) and the spin-orbit inclination (e.g. Winn
et al., 2010; Albrecht et al., 2012) while the presence of a massive close-in planet should
modify its rotational evolution (e.g. Pont, 2009; Lanza, 2010; Bolmont et al., 2012; Mc-
Quillan et al., 2013; Poppenhaeger & Wolk, 2014; Paz-Chinch´on et al., 2015; Ferraz-Mello,
2015; Ceillier et al., 2016).

At the same time, stellar structure and rotation strongly vary from the formation of
their planetary systems during their Pre-Main-Sequence to their late stage of evolution (e.g.
Maeder, 2009; Bouvier, 2008; Irwin et al., 2011; McQuillan et al., 2013, 2014, and refer-
ences therein). This has strong consequences for the amplitude of tidal dissipation in their
interiors (e.g. Zahn, 1966; Zahn & Bouchet, 1989; Ogilvie & Lin, 2007; Mathis, 2015a,b),
their magnetic activity (e.g. Barnes, 2003; Barnes & Kim, 2010; Garc´ıa et al., 2014) and
their related winds (e.g. Skumanich, 1972; Kawaler, 1988). In stellar convective regions,
tidal dissipation is due to the action of the turbulent friction applied by convective eddies
on the so-called equilibrium tide ﬂow induced by the hydrostatic elongation along the line
of centers because of the presence of the companion (Zahn, 1966; Remus et al., 2012a) and
tidal inertial waves driven by the Coriolis acceleration (Ogilvie & Lin, 2007; Goodman &
Lackner, 2009; Lai, 2012; Auclair Desrotour et al., 2015). In stellar radiation zones, it is
due to thermal diﬀusion and breaking mechanisms acting on gravito-inertial waves (Zahn,
1975; Barker & Ogilvie, 2010). In the case of the convective enveloppe of low-mass stars
recent works (Ogilvie & Lin, 2007; Barker & Ogilvie, 2009; Mathis, 2015a) demonstrated
that tidal dissipation vary over several orders of magnitude with stellar mass, age and the
related internal structure, and rotation. Simultaneously, because of their rotational evolution,
the torques applied by stellar winds vary with stellar age (Matt et al., 2015).

Since tidal dissipation and stellar winds both strongly impact the dynamical evolution of
their planetary systems along the evolution of their host stars (Barker & Ogilvie, 2009; Bol-
mont et al., 2012; Damiani & Lanza, 2015; Ferraz-Mello, 2015), it thus becomes mandatory
to take into account their potential strong variations over orders of magnitude as a function of
stellar age using their best available ab-initio modeling. In this work, we thus propose to re-
place the currently used constant values of stellar tidal dissipation calibrated on observations
(e.g. Hansen, 2010, 2012) by the new values recently computed for convective enveloppes
of low-mass stars as a function of stellar mass, age and rotation (Mathis, 2015a,b) based on

3

the theoretical work by Ogilvie (2013) using realistic stellar grid models (Siess et al., 2000).
This will allow us for the ﬁrst time to unravel the eﬀects of the rotation and tidal dissipation
history of stars on the evolution of close-in planets. In Sec. 2, we describe the implementa-
tion of the new tidal model in our state-of-the-art celestial mechanics code (Bolmont et al.,
2011, 2012). In Sec. 3, we explore the orbital evolution of planets of diﬀerent masses (from
Earth mass to Jupiter mass) around various low-mass K-,G-,F-type host stars. In Sec. 4, we
examine and discuss the impact of their orbital evolution on the stellar rotational history in
the context of asteroseismic constraints which have been recently obtained (e.g. Gizon et al.,
2013; Ceillier et al., 2016). Finally, in Sec. 5, we present the conclusions of our study and
discuss its perspectives.

2 Model description

2.1 Tidal model

2.1.1 Matching two diﬀerent tidal formalisms

The tidal model we present here is a ﬁrst step in reconciling two diﬀerent tidal formalisms.
On the one hand, we base our work on the same tidal model as in Bolmont et al. (2011,
2012, 2015), which computes the orbital tidal evolution of planetary systems and takes
into account the evolution of the star. The model is an equilibrium tide model (following
Alexander, 1973; Mignard, 1979; Hut, 1981; Eggleton et al., 1998), which is very practical
to compute orbital evolution because it works for all eccentricities (Leconte et al., 2010) and
allows for fast computation. The dissipation of the kinetic energy of the tides inside the star
is usually taken to be constant throughout the system’s evolution.

On the other hand however, as a star evolves, its radius changes, mainly on the PMS, a
radiative core appears and gets bigger while the convective enveloppe becomes shallower for
stars from 0.45 M(cid:12) to 1.4 M(cid:12). All these structural changes have a strong inﬂuence on the way
the star dissipates tidal energy (e.g. Zahn, 1966, 1975, 1977; Ogilvie & Lin, 2007; Remus
et al., 2012a; Mathis, 2015a,b) and this should be taken into account in tidal calculations.

Besides, by deﬁnition, the equilibrium tide does not take into account the dynamical tide
(Zahn, 1975; Ogilvie & Lin, 2007). The equilibrium tide corresponds only to the large-scale
ﬂows induced by the hydrostatic adjustment of the star’s structure because of the presence of
the companion (Zahn, 1966; Remus et al., 2012a). It is mainly dissipated in the convective
enveloppe of low-mass stars by the turbulent friction applied by convection (Zahn, 1977,
1989). However, both in convection and radiation zones, the equilibrium tide is not solution
of the hydrodynamics equation (e.g. Zahn, 1975; Ogilvie & Lin, 2004; Ogilvie, 2013) and
it must be completed by the so-called dynamical tide. In convective regions, the dynamical
tide is constituted of inertial waves, which are driven by the Coriolis acceleration, that are
excited when the tidal frequency ω ∈ [−2Ω(cid:63), 2Ω(cid:63)], where Ω(cid:63) is the rotation frequency of
the star (Ogilvie & Lin, 2007). If the system is coplanar and the perturber is on a circular or-
bit, the tidal frequency is simply ω ≡ 2(n − Ω(cid:63)), where n is the orbital frequency. This gives
the following condition on the orbital period of the planet: Porb > 1/2P(cid:63) for the excitation
of tidal inertial waves, where P(cid:63) is the rotation period of the star. In this context, Bolmont
et al. (2012) studied the tidal evolution of planets around evolving stars taking into account
the radius evolution of the star and its impact on the tidal evolution of planets. The plan-
ets were chosen to be initially close to the corotation radius (deﬁned as the orbital distance

4

for which n = Ω(cid:63)). Consequently, the planets considered in Bolmont et al. (2012) should
in fact raise inertial waves in the convective enveloppe of their host star. Therefore, a new
dissipation, which adds to the one of the equilibrium tide, must be taken into account be-
cause of the turbulent friction applied by convective eddies on tidal inertial waves. In stellar
radiation zones, the dynamical tide is constituted by gravito-inertial waves, in more explicit
terms internal gravity waves which are inﬂuenced by the Coriolis acceleration (Zahn, 1975;
Terquem et al., 1998; Ogilvie & Lin, 2007; Ivanov et al., 2013; Auclair Desrotour et al.,
2015). In some cases, their dissipation compete with those of the equilibrium tide and in-
ertial waves in convective regions (e.g. Goodman & Dickson, 1998; Ogilvie & Lin, 2007),
especially when massive companions excite high-amplitude waves that may non-linearly
break at the center of K- and G-type stars (Barker & Ogilvie, 2010; Barker, 2011; Guillot
et al., 2014). Tidal dissipation rates and torques are highly dependent on tidal frequency (e.g.
Ogilvie & Lin, 2004, 2007; Auclair Desrotour et al., 2015); therefore, they vary over several
orders of magnitude as a function of the excitation frequency. This has strong consequences
on tidal dynamics (Witte & Savonije, 1999; Auclair-Desrotour et al., 2014) with possible
erratic variations of orbital and rotational properties, which are not treated by ”equilibrium
tide”-like models. Solving hydrodynamics equations for tidal ﬂows and waves must thus be
done in the Fourier spectral space. This requires to expand tidal potential/force and perturb-
ing function on Fourier series (Kaula, 1964; Zahn, 1977; Mathis & Le Poncin-Laﬁtte, 2009;
Efroimsky & Makarov, 2013), with a number of mandatory modes (and frequencies) that
strongly increases with orbital eccentricity and inclination, and obliquity (Savonije, 2008).
Then, computation of tidal dynamics can become very heavy compared to ”equilibrium
tide”-like models.

This is the reason why we adopt several simpliﬁcations of the problem in this ﬁrst work
where we wish to take into account the impact of the history of tidal dissipation in stars
on the orbital dynamics of close-in planets. First, we choose to focus only on tidal dissipa-
tion in the external convective enveloppe of low-mass stars hosting planets (Ogilvie, 2013;
Mathis, 2015a,b). Therefore, we take into account the dissipation of tidal inertial waves
when Porb > 1/2P(cid:63) and of the equilibrium tide otherwise. Next, we simplify the treatment
of the frequency-dependence of the problem adopting two assumptions. On the one hand, we
focus on binary systems constituted by a planet on coplanar circular orbit around its evolv-
ing host star. The problem is thus only dependent on the main tidal frequency ω ≡ 2(n− Ω(cid:63))
introduced in the previous paragraph. We consider that the only tide driving orbital evolu-
tion is the stellar tide (meaning that the planet is synchronized with zero obliquity1). On
the other hand, instead of taking into account the full frequency-dependence of tidal dis-
sipation, we choose to adopt the frequency-averaged approach ﬁrst introduced by Ogilvie
(2013) and applied to low-mass stars by Mathis (2015a,b). The advantage of this method is
that it provides us relevant orders of magnitude for the dissipation as a function of structural
and dynamical stellar parameters (i.e. their mass, age, corresponding mass and radius of the
convective enveloppe, and rotation; Mathis, 2015a,b) even if it ﬁlters out the potential vari-
ation of the dissipation over a narrow range of frequencies (e.g. Ogilvie & Lin, 2004, 2007;
Auclair Desrotour et al., 2015). The corresponding values of averaged dissipation will be
here obtained for a range of stellar masses (0.4 to 1.4 M(cid:12)) with a metallicity of Z = 0.02 and
a mixing length parameter (scaled on the local pressure height scale) α = 1.605 calibrated

1 For a close-in planet, the evolution time scale of its rotation period and obliquity is very short. We
therefore expect the planets we consider here to be synchronized and with a null obliquity very early in the
evolution (e.g., Leconte et al., 2010).

so that when the spin of the star increases, 1/Q(cid:48) increases, thus Q(cid:48) decreases and the dissi-
pation increases.

The orbital dynamics code we use has been written in the framework of the constant
time lag model. This model is very practical to compute orbital evolution, we thus want to
continue using it. However, we now allow the dissipation σ(cid:63) (normalized bulk dissipation
per unit mass, as deﬁned in Hansen, 2010) to vary while the star evolves. The dimensionless
σ(cid:63) is linked with the dissipation factor σ(cid:63) and the time lag by the following formula:

where σ0 =
σ(cid:63) was considered constant throughout the evolution, which meant that k2

In order to incorporate the formalism from Mathis (2015b) in the framework of the
constant time lag model, one needs to express the time lag ∆τ as a function of the equivalent
lag angle δ. As discussed by Leconte et al. (2010), this is not straightforward in the general
case. Indeed, introduced equivalent tidal angle and quality factor are related to frequency-
averaged quantities computed in the Fourier space while the constant time lag model is a
model using quantities in real space such as bodies’ position and velocity. We ﬁrst do the
approximation that the lag angle δ is small so that sin

(cid:105) ≈ 2δ. Besides,

(cid:104)

2δ

2δ = ω∆τ,

(9)

where ω is the tidal frequency. In the general case of an eccentric orbit, several tidal fre-
quencies would have to be taken into account and it would become necessary to have several
terms associated with each Fourier mode. However, in the simplest case considered here of
a circular orbit, there is a unique frequency ω ≡ 2|n − Ω(cid:63)|. Consequently, the time lag is
given by:

∆τ(cid:63) =

δ

|n − Ω(cid:63)| =

4Q(cid:48)|n − Ω(cid:63)| =

3ˆ2
s|n − Ω(cid:63)| .

4Q(cid:48)

(10)

We recover the fact that when Q(cid:48)
s is small, ∆τ(cid:63) and σ(cid:63) are big and consequently the tidal
evolution timescales are shorter. As in Mathis (2015b), we see that the higher the spin of the
star, the higher the dissipation 1/Q(cid:48) or σ(cid:63).

(cid:104)

Note that for n = Ω(cid:63), there is a non-physical singularity intrinsic to the deﬁnition of the
constant time lag model given in Eq. (9) which is here the price of a lighter computation.
It would be possible to avoid it as soon as the full complex frequency-dependence of tidal
dissipation will be taken into account. Then, it would be possible to deﬁne a spectral time
lag ∆τ (ω) computed directly from Im
. However, the simple and compact equations
derived by Hut (1981) would have to be abandoned in favor of a fully spectral treatment
of dynamical equations (Mathis & Le Poncin-Laﬁtte, 2009; Remus et al., 2012a; Ogilvie,
2014) needing potential heavy computations. In this ﬁrst qualitative work, to be able to
continue to use the compact formalism, we choose to smooth out the artiﬁcial singularity by
using the following formula:

k2
2(ω)

(cid:105)

max(cid:2)|n − Ω(cid:63)|, ρ(cid:3) ,

δ

∆τ(cid:63) =

(11)

(12)

(13)

where ρ is a regularization value to avoid the singularity. ρ has the dimension of a frequency.
We tested ρ = 10−8 s−1 and ρ = 10−5 s−1 and qualitative diﬀerences appear for the most
extreme cases initially close to the corotation radius: a planet initially at corotation can fall
on the star in one case and survive in the other. However for most cases, the evolution is
qualitatively similar, although not exactly quantitatively similar.

2.1.2 Tidal secular evolution

Thanks to this method linking the equivalent modiﬁed quality factor to the time lag (or to
the dissipation factor σ(cid:63)), we are able to simulate the tidal evolution of planets using the
constant time lag formalism (Mignard, 1979; Eggleton et al., 1998; Bolmont et al., 2011).
Taking into account here only the stellar tide, the secular tidal evolution of the semi-major
axis a is given by:

and depends on the stellar mass M(cid:63), its dissipation σ(cid:63) and the planet mass Mp. Na1(e) and
Na2(e) are eccentricity-dependent factors, which are valid even for very high eccentricity
(Hut, 1981):

Na1(e) =

Na2(e) =

1 + 31/2e2 + 255/8e4 + 185/16e6 + 85/64e8

(1 − e2)15/2

.

,

In the present case, as the orbits we consider are circular, Na1(e) = Na2(e) = 1.

In our model, the planets are driven by the dynamical tide when Porb > 1/2P(cid:63) and by
the equilibrium tide when Porb < 1/2P(cid:63). When the equilibrium tide is driving the evolution,
the dissipation factor is taken to be the normalized bulk dissipation per unit mass σ(cid:63) for a
1 Gyr star and a tidal period of 1 day given in Hansen (2012). This equilibrium tide factor
is given in Table 1 for the stars considered in this work. When the dynamical tide is driving
the evolution, the dissipation factor is obtained using Equations 8 to 11.

2.1.3 Stellar wind

We also take into account the spin down of the star due to the stellar wind. As in Bouvier
et al. (1997), we assume that the stars considered here rotate as solid bodies, although more
recent work has included the eﬀect of internal diﬀerential rotation between the radiative
core and the convective enveloppe (e.g., Bouvier, 2008; Gallet & Bouvier, 2013; Penev
et al., 2014; Gallet & Bouvier, 2015). The wind braking processes at work for a Sun-like
star are the same as for other low-mass stars (Matt et al., 2015) so we consider the same wind
parametrization for all stars. We use here the torque formula from Bouvier et al. (1997) with
updated estimates for the saturation spin ωsat from Matt et al. (2015). In this work, M(cid:63)
is held constant, and the eﬀect of mass loss (through processes like stellar winds) on the
internal structure of the star is considered negligible.

Our calculations begin during the stellar Pre Main Sequence (PMS). As in Bolmont et al.
(2012) we use the “disk locking” parametrization (e.g., Bouvier et al., 1997; Rebull et al.,
2004, 2006; Edwards et al., 1993; Choi & Herbst, 1996), which consists in assuming that
the rotation period of the star remains at an initial constant value for a given time (hypothe-
sized to be associated with the time of disk dissipation). After this time, the spin of the star
evolves from this initial value depending on its radius contraction rate and the inﬂuence of
the stellar wind. We thus start our calculations at the moment of “disk dispersal” and we
consider that the planets are fully formed at that point.

One goal of the present work is to determine how diﬀerent stellar spin and dissipation
histories inﬂuence the star-planet tidal interaction. To this end, we consider three diﬀerent
stellar masses: 0.6, 1.0 and 1.2 M(cid:12) and consider an initial spin rate of P(cid:63),0 = 1.2 day, which
corresponds to the fast enveloppe of the observed stellar spin distribution (Bouvier et al.,
1997). In Section 4.2, we consider other initial spin rates: P(cid:63),0 = 8 day, which corresponds
to the slow enveloppe of the observed stellar spin distribution and an intermediate initial
spin rate: P(cid:63),0 = 3 day.

As in Bolmont et al. (2012), we consider both the inﬂuence of tides and the stellar wind
on the rotation of the star. The expression for the angular momentum loss rate is (Kawaler,
1988; MacGregor & Brenner, 1991; Bouvier et al., 1997):

simulations were done with a regularization value ρ of 10−5 s−1. The initial rotation period of the stars is
1.2 day.

Here K, and ωsat are parameters of the model from Bouvier et al. (1997). We use the
value of K = 1.7 × 1047 cgs for all stars and we choose ωsat from Matt et al. (2015) so that:

for M(cid:63) = 1.0 M(cid:12)

.

Bouvier et al. (1997) showed that for fast rotators (Ω(cid:63) > ωsat), µ = 1 and for slow rotators
(Ω(cid:63) < ωsat), µ = 3.

2.1.4 Evolution of stellar rotation period and dissipation

Figure 1 shows the evolution of the radius and rotation period of the star, as well as the
s and its counterpart Q(cid:48) (cf Eq. 7), and the normalized
structural equivalent quality factor Q(cid:48)

and 1.2 M(cid:12). All stars have an initial rotation period of 1.2 day. For the last panel of Fig.
1b), we simulated the evolution for two cases. Either the evolution is driven following our
model (full lines) or the evolution is solely driven by the equilibrium tide with a constant
dissipation (dashed lines, as in Bolmont et al., 2012). Table 1 shows the stellar parameters
used in this work.

These evolutions were calculated for a 1 M⊕ planet orbiting the diﬀerent stars at a semi-
major axis of 1000 AU, which means that the inﬂuence of the planet on the evolution of the
star is negligible. Besides, the planet is so far away from the star that it does not actually
tidally evolve in the 5 Gyr timescale of the simulation. Consequently, this allows us to see
the variation of the dissipation in the star due to its structural evolution. Besides, in this
conﬁguration where the planet is very far away, the planet following our model is always
evolving due to the dynamical tide (Porb is always higher than 1/2P(cid:63)). The tidal frequency
can be here approximated by ∼ 2Ω(cid:63).

Table 1 also shows the initial time we consider for the beginning of our simulations.
This initial time corresponds to the time of disk dissipation, when the disk no longer has an
inﬂuence on the dynamical evolution of the planets. For M(cid:63) = 1 M(cid:12) and M(cid:63) = 1.2 M(cid:12),
the initial time is taken to be 5 Myr, however for M(cid:63) = 0.6 M(cid:12) it is taken to be 8.2 Myr.
The lower the mass of the star, the later the radiative core appears. For a star of mass M(cid:63) =
0.6 M(cid:12), this happens at an age of 8.2 Myr. Before the apparition of the radiative core, the
inertial waves propagate in a fully convective sphere and cannot reﬂect in a way that leads
to the formation of sheared waves attractors that may lead to strong dissipation (Ogilvie &
Lin, 2004, 2007); the dissipation is therefore very weak and the equivalent modiﬁed quality
factor very high.

Figure 1 shows that the spin of the stars evolves accordingly with the observations (Matt
et al., 2015). Indeed, for M(cid:63) = 1 M(cid:12), we reproduce today’s Sun rotation period (the dot in
Fig. 1). For M(cid:63) = 1.2 M(cid:12), the rotation at 5 Gyr is comparable to that of the Sun, while for
M(cid:63) = 0.6 M(cid:12) it is slower.
Figure 1 also shows that the values of the dissipation σ(cid:63) in our model are in agreement
with the equivalent modiﬁed quality factor Q(cid:48)
s from Mathis (2015b). Indeed, during the
PMS stage the dissipation of the high mass stars is higher than that of the low mass stars
(Q(cid:48)
s decreases with mass) but during the MS stage the dissipation of the low mass stars is
higher than the dissipation of the high mass stars (Q(cid:48)
s increases with mass). The dissipation
factor σ(cid:63) evolves on the one hand due to the changes of the structural equivalent modiﬁed
quality factor Q(cid:48)
s, and on the other hand due to the changes in the spin of the star (through
the parameter ˆ). Figure 1 also shows the evolution of Q(cid:48), which encompasses both eﬀects.
Ferraz-Mello (2015) gives the value of Q for a number of observed planetary systems.
Among them, the CoRoT candidate LRc06E21637 (M(cid:63) = 0.93 M(cid:12)) allows us to compare
our value of the tidal quality factor Q with the value of Q = 6 × 106 given by Ferraz-Mello
(2015). The orbital period of the brown-dwarf companion is Porb = 5.81 day and the rotation

11

period of the star is P(cid:63) = 8.95 day, so the evolution of this system is driven by the dynamical
tide. If the star is on the main sequence, our model gives a value of the structural tidal quality
factor of Q(cid:48)
s = 103. From the rotation period of the star and Eq. 7, we can thus infer a value
of Q(cid:48) of 5.9 × 106. Assuming that the quadrupolar Love number of this star is k2 = 0.03
and using Eq. 4, this gives us a value of Q = 1.18 × 105, which is 50 times lower than the
value of Ferraz-Mello (2015). Given that Ferraz-Mello (2015) does not take into account the
dynamical tide, this should be the reason why we ﬁnd a higher dissipation (lower Q).
s decreases and the rotation increases which
has the eﬀect of increasing the dissipation σ(cid:63). Then, from a age of 10 Myrs, Q(cid:48)
s increases
but the rotation still increases suﬃciently so that the dissipation increases for about another
∼ 5 Myr. From ∼ 15 Myr to ∼ 35 Myr (i.e., when the star reaches the MS), the dissipation
σ(cid:63) decreases because the spinning up of the star brakes down and Q(cid:48)
s still increases. Then,
from ∼ 35 Myr to the end of the simulation, Q(cid:48)
s is constant and the dissipation σ(cid:63) decreases
slowly due to the spinning down of the star.

Let us consider M(cid:63) = 1 M(cid:12). At ﬁrst Q(cid:48)

For a star of M(cid:63) = 0.6 M(cid:12), the increase of the dissipation is more pronounced due to
the fact that the star spins up longer and faster and also that Q(cid:48)
s does not evolve as much as
for the Sun-like star. However, for a star of M(cid:63) = 1.2 M(cid:12), the increase of dissipation is less
pronounced because it does not spin-up as much as the Sun-like star and Q(cid:48)
s decreases by
almost 2 orders of magnitude when reaching its minimum in the PMS.

Finally, Figure 1b also shows the evolution of the tidal timescale T(cid:63) (Eq. 13) for a 1 M⊕
planet at 0.026 AU (ﬁxed semi-major axis) around the diﬀerent stars. The timescale T(cid:63) was
computed for two cases: due to the dynamical tide (regardless of the domain of validity,
represented in full lines in Fig. 1b) and due to the equilibrium tide (dashed lines). For this
last panel, we do not consider the case of the planet at 1000 AU because its tidal evolution
timescale would be much larger than the age of the universe. This last panel of Figure 1b is
to show the typical evolution of the tidal timescale with the structural evolution of the star.
For all stars, the equilibrium tide evolution timescale (dashed lines) increases with time due
to the shrinking of the radius. It decreases with increasing stellar mass, due to the higher
stellar radius for higher masses. The dynamical tide evolution timescale also increases with
time, but this time its evolution is not solely linked to the evolution of the radius, but also the
evolution of σ(cid:63) (or Q(cid:48), or Q(cid:48)
s and Ω(cid:63)). The evolution timescales reaches with a plateau more
or less pronounced corresponding to the moment where the structural equivalent modiﬁed
quality factor Q(cid:48)

s becomes constant.

The comparative evolution of the timescales depending on the mass of the star is not
straightforward because it depends on a lot of parameters: the structural evolution of the star,
through the radius and Q(cid:48)
s and also on the spin. Nonetheless, we can see that in the beginning
and in the end of the stellar evolution considered here, T(cid:63) decreases when increasing stellar
mass. In the beginning of the evolution, T(cid:63) is smaller for 1.2 M(cid:12) because of both the higher
dissipation σ(cid:63) (or lower Q(cid:48)) and the higher radius, while from 4 Gyr to 5 Gyr, despite a
smaller dissipation σ(cid:63), T(cid:63) is smaller for 1.2 M(cid:12) only because the radius is much bigger
than the 0.6 and 1 M(cid:12) stars.

3 Orbital tidal evolution

We therefore investigate how this new model impacts the orbital tidal evolution of planets
compared with the standard equilibrium tide model of Bolmont et al. (2012). We consider
planets from 1 M⊕ to 1 MJup orbiting the three diﬀerent stars considered here.

12

3.1 Evolution of planets orbiting 1 M(cid:12)

Figure 2 shows the tidal evolution if the system was evolving solely due to the equilib-
rium tide (dashed lines) and if it was evolving following our model (full lines). In the latter
scenario, the planet evolves due to the dynamical tide during the ﬁrst few 100 Myr of its
evolution (when Porb > 1/2P(cid:63)). When the star has spun down suﬃciently, so that the orbital
period becomes less than half the stellar rotation period, the equilibrium tide takes over and
the dissipation σ(cid:63) decreases to the value of Hansen (2012).

Fig. 2 Tidal evolution of a 1 M⊕ planet around an evolving 1 M(cid:12) star. The evolution calculated with the
equilibrium tide model using Hansen (2012)’s dissipation factor (see Table 1) is represented in dashed lines.
The evolution calculated with our model of the dynamical tide is represented in full lines. Top: evolution of
the semi-major axis of the planets (colors), corotation radius of the star (bold black dashed lines) and the line
deﬁning Porb = 1/2P(cid:63) (thin black dashed lines). Middle: rotation period of the star, the rotation of the Sun
at present time is represented with a black dot. Bottom: Evolution of the normalized dissipation factor σ(cid:63).
These simulations were done with a regularization value ρ of 10−8 s−1.

For planets closer than 0.03 AU, the diﬀerence between an evolution driven by the equi-
librium tide and an evolution driven by the dynamical tide is clearly visible. For a planet
of 1M⊕, due to the very low dissipation, the equilibrium tide do not cause any signiﬁcant
migration. However, as the dynamical tide is responsible for a dissipation factor higher by
several orders of magnitude than the equilibrium tide dissipation, the planet experiences a
faster migration. This means that the planet is much more sensitive to the rotation period

evolution of the star: planets interior to the corotation radius will migrate inward, while
those exterior to the corotation radius migrate further outwards than before.

Figure 2 shows that the rotation period of the star is not particularly inﬂuenced by the
planet. Except from a small deviation around t = 1 Myr due to the passage of the planet
through corotation, the spin of the star follows the same evolution for all planets and the
rotation tends to that of the Sun at present day (as observed for example for KOIs, see e.g.
Ceillier et al., 2016).

For the innermost planet, we notice the same kind of behavior that was ﬁrst observed
by Bolmont et al. (2011) of inward migration followed by outward migration as the planet
crosses the shrinking corotation radius. This planet was “saved” from falling onto the star
by the spinning-up of the star. Later on in the evolution, the planet crosses once more the
expanding corotation radius. However, as the dissipation is lower at that time because of the
evolution of Q(cid:48)
s and of the rotation, no signiﬁcant orbital changes are visible. As discussed
in section 2.1.1, note that when the planet crosses corotation the dissipation increases.

In this framework, we investigated the inﬂuence of the parameter ρ that smoothes the
divergence when n = Ω(cid:63) (Eq. 11) and for most cases it is negligible. In some cases, massive
planets located very close to the corotation can either survive and migrate outward when
ρ = 10−5 s−1, or migrate inward and fall onto the star when ρ = 10−8 s−1. Apart from these
very speciﬁc cases, the diﬀerence in ρ only inﬂuences slightly the ﬁnal semi-major axis (less
than a percent).

When increasing the mass of the planet, the tide raised in the star is bigger and the plan-
ets migrate outward farther away. Figure 3a shows the evolution of a 10 M⊕ planet. The
planets experiencing outward migration migrate from ∼ 0.02 AU to semi-major axes big-

ger than 0.03 AU. The two planets beginning below the corotation radius migrate inwards.
The inward migration happens in three steps. The ﬁrst one is due to the dynamical tide
which very quickly makes the planet migrate to the limit Porb = 1/2P(cid:63) (thin black dashed
lines in Fig. 3a). Once the planet reaches this limit, after a few thousand hundred years, the
equilibrium tide drives the evolution with a much lower dissipation. The planets’s inward
migration then occurs on a much longer timescale. However the star continues spinning up
so that P(cid:63) decreases on shorter timescales than Porb does. When 1/2P(cid:63) becomes smaller
than Porb, the dynamical tide drives the inward migration once more until Porb = 1/2P(cid:63).
Consequently, the dissipation in the star jumps back and forth from the dynamical value
to the equilibrium value and the planet stays on the limit Porb = 1/2P(cid:63) for a few million
years. Figure 3a shows this behavior but the sampling of our outputs do not allow to see the
dissipation jumping more than once. In the end, the planet migrates inward suﬃciently due
to the equilibrium tide to escape this blockage and collide with the star in less than 100 Myr.
When increasing even more the mass of the planet, for example to Mp = 1 MJup, the
planets initially outside the corotation radius migrate even farther away. Figure 3b shows
that typically for a star with an initial rotation period of 1.2 day, the planets migrate from
∼ 0.02 AU to 0.05 AU in a Gyr or so. For Jupiter mass planets, there is a huge diﬀerence
in the evolution following our model including the dynamical tide and the evolution due to
the equilibrium tide. Planets beginning just outside the corotation radius fall onto the star

in a few Gyr when evolving due to the equilibrium tide. As the equilibrium tide evolution
timescale is very big, the planets are not sensitive to the initial spin of the star. Their tidal
evolution is noticeable only when the star has already spun down signiﬁcantly. However,
when evolving due to the dynamical tide, they survive and migrate to 0.05 AU.

As discussed in Bolmont et al. (2012), when the planet falls at late ages onto the braking
star, it entails an important spinning-up of the rotation. However, with our new model, the
planets falling onto the star do so very early in the stellar history so that the spin history of
the star is not altered signiﬁcantly (see Sec. 4).

3.2 Evolution of planets orbiting other stars

Figure 4 shows the evolution of a planet of 2 M⊕ (4a) and 1 MJup (4b) initially orbiting each
of the three diﬀerent stars outside of corotation.

For low mass planets, the evolution does not depend a lot on the star, they do not migrate
very far away from the star. For a planet of mass 2 M⊕, a diﬀerence can be seen between the
lowest mass star and the two others. Figure 4a shows that the dissipation of the 1 M(cid:12) star is
very similar to the dissipation of the 1.2 M(cid:12) star for the ﬁrst million year of the evolution
(which can also be seen in Fig. 1). Consequently, the planets orbiting these two stars undergo
a very similar evolution. The diﬀerence in the dissipation of the 1 M(cid:12) star and the 1.2 M(cid:12)
occurring after one million year is not suﬃcient to cause a diﬀerence in the orbital evolution.
However, the dissipation of the 0.6 M(cid:12) star is initially one order of magnitude smaller
than the two other stars. After a few million years and for the rest of the evolution, the
dissipation of the 0.6 M(cid:12) becomes more than one order of magnitude higher than the two
other stars. However, the tidal evolution timescale does not only depend on the dissipation
of the star but also on its radius. Equation 13 shows that the smaller the radius of the star,
the longer the evolution timescales. Thus, despite a higher dissipation, the tidal evolution
around the 0.6 M(cid:12) star occurs on longer timescales than the more massive stars.

For high mass planets, such as the Jupiter-mass planet of Fig. 4b, the migration occurs
on shorter timescales as discussed in the previous section. The diﬀerence between a star
of 0.6 M(cid:12) and the two more massive ones is more pronounced. The planet orbiting the
lowest mass star migrates outward less than for the other stars but does so for a longer time.
This is due to the smaller radius of the 0.6 M(cid:12) star which does more than compensate the
higher dissipation. Due to the increase of the dissipation happening in the ﬁrst few 107 yr of
evolution, the migration of the planet ﬁrst accelerates. Then as the dissipation σ(cid:63) stabilizes,
the migration decelerates due to the increase of the semi-major axis and the consequent
increase of the evolution timescale.

The evolution of the planet orbiting the 1 M(cid:12) star is slightly diﬀerent than the one or-
biting the 1.2 M(cid:12) star. Migration initially happens faster around a 1.2 M(cid:12) star than a 1 M(cid:12)
star because the radius of the higher mass star is bigger (their dissipation being of the same
order of magnitude). However as time passes, the evolution timescale of the planet orbiting
the 1.2 M(cid:12) star increases ﬁrst because the planet migrates outward and second because the
dissipation σ(cid:63) decreases by almost two orders of magnitude. In the end, the outward migra-
tion stops around an age of 30 Myr at a semi-major axis of ∼ 0.05 AU. For the 1 M(cid:12) star,
the combination of a smaller radius and a higher dissipation leads to a slower evolution on a
longer time so that the planet reaches ∼ 0.05 AU around an age of ∼ 200 Myr.

16

4 Rotational evolution of the host star

During their orbital evolution, the planets inﬂuence the rotation of their host star. This in-
ﬂuence is more or less visible depending on the initial semi-major axis and the mass of the
planet. One extreme exemple can be seen in Figure 3b, when the evolution is driven by the
equilibrium tide. The close-in planets collide with the star in a few gigayears and this en-
tails an acceleration of the rotation of the star (see Bolmont et al., 2012, for a description of
this phenomenon). However, when the evolution is calculated with our model and the star is
initially rotating fast, the inﬂuence is less visible as it leads to much less collisions.

4.1 Inﬂuence of the planet on the rotation of the star

We investigated the inﬂuence of the planet on the rotation of the star for each star considered
here. In order to quantify the eﬀect of the planet on the spin of the star, we introduce the
quantity δP deﬁned as follows:

δP = P(cid:63),tides=on, t=5 Gyr − P(cid:63),tides=oﬀ, t=5 Gyr,

(15)

where P(cid:63),tides=on, t=5 Gyr is the rotation period of the star at an age of 5 Gyr for simulations
with our tidal model and P(cid:63),tides=oﬀ, t=5 Gyr is rotation period of the star at an age of 5 Gyr for
simulations with only the inﬂuence of the wind-braking.

Figure 5 shows the variation of this quantity with the mass of the planet, for diﬀerent
initial semi-major axes: 0.024, 0.026, 0.028, ..., 0.040 AU and for the 3 diﬀerent stars con-
sidered here. Only the spin of the stars whose planets have survived the 5 Gyr evolution is
plotted. As the star considered here is an initially fast rotator, the planets considered here all
migrate outwards during their evolution. We discuss in the following section what happens
when the planets fall towards the star, which occurs when the star is an initially slow rotator.
We ﬁnd that the more massive the star, the less inﬂuence the planet has on the stellar spin
evolution; and the more massive the planet, the more inﬂuence the planet has on the stellar
spin evolution. We retrieve here the signature of the applied torque, which scales for a circu-
(cid:63) (R(cid:63)/a)6 (Ω(cid:63) − n) (Zahn, 1989). The planets have here the eﬀect
lar orbit as (Mp/M(cid:63))2M(cid:63)R2
of slowing down the rotation of the star. For planets less massive than 10 M⊕, the eﬀect of
the planet on the spin of the star is negligible. For Mp = 10 M⊕, the diﬀerence at 5 Gyr is
of a few hours, while for Mp = 1 MJup = 317.8 M⊕ it can reach several days. A hot Jupiter
around an initially fast rotating Sun-like star can slow down the rotation of its star by a day.
We can see that δP is bigger for a Jupiter-mass planet orbiting a 0.6 M(cid:12) star, where the
diﬀerence can be up to 3 days for the close-in planets. With such a diﬀerence, the inﬂuence
a planet has on the stellar spin can be potentially measured. Indeed, high resolution photo-
metric space missions such as CoRoT (Baglin et al., 2006) and Kepler (Borucki et al., 2010)
allows us to precisely measure stellar rotation (a sensibility up to 10% of the rotation period;
e.g. Garc´ıa et al., 2014) and to test proposed gyrochronology relationships (e.g. Gizon et al.,
2013; McQuillan et al., 2013; Paz-Chinch´on et al., 2015; Ceillier et al., 2016; van Saders
et al., 2016). For example, Ceillier et al. (2016) demonstrated that the rotation of KOIs host-
ing low-mass planets are the same, up to the observational sensitivity, that assumed single
similar solar-type stars. This result is coherent with our theoretical prediction.

4.2 Inﬂuence of initial rotation spin

Bouvier et al. (1997) were considering two populations of stars which are thought to bracket
to the possible state of stars just after the disk dissipation: the initially fast rotators (P(cid:63),0 =
1.2 day) and the initially slow rotators (P(cid:63),0 = 8 day). Following Bolmont et al. (2012), we
investigated here the inﬂuence of the initial rotation spin of the star on the outcome of the
planets considering an initially fast rotator (P(cid:63),0 = 1.2 day), an initially slow rotator (P(cid:63),0
= 8 day) and a star with an intermediate initial spin (P(cid:63),0 = 3 day). Figure 6 shows the
evolution of a Jupiter-mass planet orbiting the three diﬀerent stars and for the three diﬀerent
initial stellar rotation periods. The planets initially around faster rotating stars migrate farther
away and the more massive the star, the bigger are the diﬀerences between the diﬀerent
stellar initial spins.

For 0.6 M(cid:12), the planets initially closer than 0.05 AU undergo a diﬀerent evolution de-
pending on the initial rotation state of the star. It is especially true for the innermost planet:
it survives and migrates outward for P(cid:63),0 = 1.2 day, it falls onto the star for P(cid:63),0 = 3 day
and it does not experience signiﬁcant orbital migration for P(cid:63),0 = 8 day. For P(cid:63),0 = 1.2 day,
it is initially exterior to the corotation distance and in the region where Porb > 1/2P(cid:63) so it
rapidly migrates outward due to the dynamical tide. However, for P(cid:63),0 = 3 day, it is initially
interior to the corotation distance so it migrates inward and as it is also in the region where
Porb < 1/2P(cid:63), the equilibrium tide is initially driving the evolution. However as the star
spins up, the planet reaches the limit Porb = 1/2P(cid:63) and the dynamical tide takes over. The
planet stays for a few 10 million years on the limit Porb = 1/2P(cid:63) following the mechanism
introduced in Section 3.1 before falling onto the star. Note that while falling onto the star,
the planet makes the star spin up, which is visible on the second panel of Figure 6c with
the dark green dashed line. Finally for P(cid:63),0 = 8 day, the planet is initially interior to the
corotation radius so it migrates inward, however contrary to the previous case the star does

not spin up enough, so that the condition Porb = 1/2P(cid:63) is never met. The planet therefore
evolves solely due to the equilibrium tide, and as the equilibrium tide dissipation is small,
the evolution timescales are very long and the planet essentially remains at its initial semi-
major axis. For planets farther away, the only diﬀerence between the diﬀerent stellar initial
spins is the ﬁnal semi-major axis. This qualitative diﬀerence vanishes for planets initially at
more than 0.05 AU.

When the planet evolves due to the dynamical tide, the dissipation σ(cid:63) follows the same
kind of evolution independently of the initial stellar rotation. However there is a quantitative
diﬀerence due to the diﬀerence of spin (Eq. 10), which entails an order of magnitude of
diﬀerence for σ(cid:63) between the fast rotator and the slow rotator. Planets orbiting the slow
rotating star (P(cid:63),0 = 8 day) leave the region Porb > 1/2P(cid:63) earlier in the evolution of the star
than for the other stars. In the end, the evolution around slowly rotating stars is slower for
two reasons: the slower rotation and the fact that the dynamical tide drives the evolution for
a shorter time.

The higher the mass of the star, the higher the corotation radius for the same initial
rotation period. Consequently the close-in planet (at 0.02 AU), which was just outside the
corotation radius when orbiting the 0.6 M(cid:12) star initially rotating at P(cid:63),0 = 1.2 day, is just
inside the corotation radius when orbiting the 1.0 M(cid:12) star initially rotating at P(cid:63),0 = 1.2 day.
Consequently, the planet falls onto the star. And it does so independently of the initial stellar
spin. The only diﬀerence is that the faster the star is rotating, the quickest the planet falls:
about 1 Myr for P(cid:63),0 = 1.2 day, a few 10 Myr for P(cid:63),0 = 3 day and a few 100 Myr for
P(cid:63),0 = 8 day. For farther out planets, the only diﬀerence is the ﬁnal semi-major axis, which is

clearly visible for the planet beginning its evolution at 0.036 AU. Indeed, this planet migrates
slightly inward for P(cid:63),0 = 8 day, it migrates outward up to 0.04 AU for P(cid:63),0 = 3 day,
and up to 0.05 AU for P(cid:63),0 = 1.2 day. Planets initially farther than 0.07 AU undergo the
same evolution (= no orbital evolution) independently of the initial rotation state of the
star. For a star of 1.2 M(cid:12), the diﬀerences with 0.6 M(cid:12) are even more marked. Due to the
higher mass and consequent increase of the corotation radius the planet initially at 0.036 AU
experiences diﬀerent evolution depending on the initial spin: it survives and migrates away
when P(cid:63),0 = 1.2 day, it falls onto the star when P(cid:63),0 = 3 day and migrates in on a gigayear
timescale when P(cid:63),0 = 8 day.

Figure 6 also shows that hot Jupiters can be found at small orbital distances around
initially slow rotating stars. If formation mechanisms in the protoplanetary disk allow to
form hot Jupiters equally around all three type of stars, we therefore ﬁnd that they are more
likely to survive on gigayear timescales around low-mass stars rather than higher mass stars.
This statement is in contradiction with the observations that show that the occurrence rate
of hot Jupiters around low mass stars is very low (e.g. Bonﬁls et al., 2013). The diﬀerence
in the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters around low mass stars compared to Sun-like stars must
therefore depend on tidal dissipation in the stellar radiative core (Guillot et al., 2014) or on
formation mechanisms rather than on the following tidal evolution related to the dissipation
in the convective enveloppe. For an initially slowly rotating 1 M(cid:12) star, Jupiter mass plan-
ets survive a 5 Gyr evolution if they start their evolution at a semi-major axis bigger than
0.028 AU. However these planets would be currently migrating towards the star. For exem-
ple, the orbit of a hot Jupiter beginning at 0.028 AU around an initially slowly rotating star
shrinks to 0.024 AU after ∼ 5.3 Gyr of evolution.

Due to tidal interaction, the massive planets either fall or migrate away. When falling
onto the star, the planets make their host star spin-up. This phenomenon was discussed in
Pont (2009) and Bolmont et al. (2012). Figure 7 shows the evolution of the semi-major axis
of planets orbiting a 1 M(cid:12) star with an initial rotation of 8 day, as well as the evolution of
the corresponding stellar spin. The planets can be sorted into two populations: three planets
are falling onto the star and three planets survive the 5 Gyr evolution. Among the three
falling planets, two of them fall onto the star in less than 2 Gyr, making the star spin up
signiﬁcantly. For example, the planet falling when the star is 2 Gyr makes the star spin up
to ∼ 7 day, when it should have had a rotation of ∼ 20 day. The planet which is still falling
at an age of 5 Gyr is responsible for an spin-up of about 8 day with respect to the “normal”
rotation period at that moment. This diﬀerence will increase as the planet continues falling
towards the star.

The ingestion of planets by the star has been one explanation proposed for the observed
dearth of close-in planets around fast rotating stars (see McQuillan et al. 2013 for the ob-
servational aspect and Teitler & K¨onigl 2014 for a theoretical explanation using a standard
equilibrium tide model). An alternative explanation based on a combination of secular or-
bital evolution in a multiple planet system and tides was suggested by Lanza & Shkolnik
(2014). They showed that around old stars – and thus according to gyrochronology slowly
rotating stars – planets initially far away and excited on a very eccentric orbit could have
had time be tidally circularized on short orbits. We show here that due to the stronger tidal
dissipation induced by dynamical tide, this observed dearth can also be partly accounted by
the outward migration of the planets which depletes the inner parts of a system. We will in-
vestigate in the future the eﬀect of this higher dissipation on the evolution of multiple planet
systems using the Mercury-T code (Bolmont et al., 2015).

5 Conclusions

We present here a new tidal model, which constitutes a ﬁrst step in the endeavor to reconcile
two tidal formalisms. This improvement constitutes a ﬁrst step because 1) it is using an av-
eraged model for the quality factor of the star (see Mathis, 2015b) and 2) it is only valid for
non-inclined circular systems. This new model takes into account the eﬀect of the dynami-
cal tide, and more speciﬁcally the evolution of the dynamical tide-induced dissipation in the
convective enveloppe over the evolution of the host star.

We found that due to the consequent enhanced dissipation compared to a standard equi-
librium tide dissipation, the planets experience a more pronounced tidal orbital evolution.
For example, a Jupiter mass planet orbiting a fast rotating star can migrate from ∼ 0.02 AU
to 0.05 AU when its evolution is due to the dynamical tide instead of falling onto the star
when its evolution is due to the equilibrium tide. This changes the conclusions of the work
of Bolmont et al. (2012) and underlines the need to incorporate better tidal models in orbital
dynamics codes.

We found that the planets have behaviors more similar to what was ﬁrst introduced in
Bolmont et al. (2011) than to what was shown in Bolmont et al. (2012). This means that
the dynamical tide is strong enough so that planets can be inﬂuenced by the early age spin

evolution of the star. Indeed, a planet with an initial orbital distance much smaller than
the corotation radius will migrate inwards to eventually fall onto the star. A planet initially
exterior to the corotation radius will migrate outward. Finally, a planet initially interior to
the corotation radius but suﬃciently close to it can be saved by the spin-up of the star during
the PMS phase (and the consequent shrinking of the corotation radius).

We also found that planets initially interior to the corotation radius fall onto the star in
three steps. First, the dynamical tide brings the planet to the limit Porb = 1/2P(cid:63). Second,
a competition between the acceleration of the rotation of the star and the equilibrium tide-
induced inward migration causes the planet to remain at Porb = 1/2P(cid:63). Third, when the
planet has suﬃciently migrated inward, the equilibrium tide is strong enough to make the
planet fall onto the star.

We investigated the inﬂuence of the initial spin of the star on the orbital evolution of the
planets and we found that for a Jupiter-mass planet the tidal evolution around a star initially
rotating at P(cid:63),0 = 1.2 day, 3 day and 8 day is diﬀerent if the planet is closer than ∼ 0.07 AU.
Depending on the initial spin, a close-in planet can either fall onto the star, migrate outward
or not experience any signiﬁcant orbital evolution. For a planet of 1M⊕, this limit decreased
to ∼ 0.03 AU. We found that “really” hot Jupiters (Porb < 5 day) would be more common
around initially slow rotating stars, and if their formation rate was independent on the stellar
mass, they would be more common around low mass stars. This illustrates the fact that the
scarcity of hot Jupiters around low mass stars may be due to the dissipation in the radiative
core or to formation mechanisms within the protoplanetary disk.

We found that the planet has a negligible eﬀect on the spin rotation history of the star
unless its mass is higher than 10 M⊕. For a 1 M(cid:12) star, the presence of a hot Jupiter around an
initially fast rotating star can lead to a spin-down of the star of one day at an age of 5 Gyr.
For an initially fast rotating 0.6 M(cid:12) star, the spin-down can be up to three days. However,
when considering initially slow rotating stars, more planets are engulfed causing a spin-up
of the stellar rotation. Consequently, observations of the spin of stars hosting hot Jupiters for
which we know the age (through another mean than gyrochronology) could eventually tell
us something about the rotation history of the star: if the star is rotating slower than it would
without planets, it means that it was probably initially rotating fast; if however the star is
rotating faster than it would without planets, it means that it was probably initially rotat-
ing slow. This can be now probed thanks to high-precision asteroseismology. Note that the
modiﬁcation of the rotational evolution of a low-mass star due to the presence of a massive
companion may also have several important consequences. First, because of the applied tidal
torque, the angular momentum redistribution inside the star may be modiﬁed in comparison
to the case of a single star (see e.g. Zahn, 1992, 1994; Mathis & Zahn, 2004; Mathis &
Remus, 2013; Amard et al., 2016). Then, internal diﬀerential rotation proﬁle may be diﬀer-
ent, leading to a diﬀerent mixing of chemical elements and thus diﬀerent surface chemical
abundances at the surface (Zahn, 1994). Next, it may aﬀect the magnetic activity of cool and
solar-type stars. Indeed, surface magnetic ﬁelds observed at the surface of low-mass stars
are generated by a dynamo action occurring in their external convective zone, the amplitude,
the geometry and the possible cyclic behavior of the ﬁelds being strongly correlated with the
mass, the age and the rotation of stars (see e.g. Charbonneau, 2014; Brun, 2014).

As explained before, this model is a ﬁrst step towards a coherent description of tidal
dissipation in orbital dynamics codes. First, as discussed in §2.1.1, dissipation of tidal waves
in the radiative core of low-mass stars hosting planets as well as the angular momentum
exchanges with the surrounding convective enveloppe should be taken into account. Next,
additional complex physical mechanisms that may impact tidal ﬂows and their dissipation

22

such as diﬀerential rotation (Baruteau & Rieutord, 2013; Favier et al., 2014; Guenel et al.,
2016) and magnetic ﬁelds (Barker & Lithwick, 2014) have to be studied. The same eﬀort
should also be undertaken for planetary interiors to have tidal models taking into account
their structural and dynamical properties (e.g. Correia & Laskar, 2003; Ogilvie & Lin, 2004;
Tobie et al., 2005; Henning et al., 2009; Efroimsky, 2012; Remus et al., 2012b; Correia
et al., 2014; Guenel et al., 2014). The second important step, will be to take into account
dependence of tidal dissipation/torques on tidal frequency. It will allows us to treat the case
of eccentric orbits and avoid any singularity of tidal models. Finally, it would be important
to take into account orbital inclination and planetary obliquity (e.g. Lai, 2012).

Furthermore, the wind prescription we used in this work (Bouvier et al., 1997) can also
be improved for example by using a more recent parametrization which depends closely on
the structural evolution of the star (Matt et al., 2015) and the geometry of the ﬁeld (R´eville
et al., 2015). This would be particularly useful in order to have a more precise insight of the
inﬂuence of the planets on the spin history of the star. Finally, we will use our model to try to
reproduce the orbital and stellar spin state of known systems (as was done in Ferraz-Mello,
2015, which found similar results as Bolmont et al. 2012 and in Damiani & Lanza 2015).
