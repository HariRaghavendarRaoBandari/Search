The ternary Goldbach problem with primes in

positive density sets

Quanli Shen ∗

Abstract

Let P denote the set of all primes. P1, P2, P3 are three subsets of P.
Let δ(Pi) (i = 1, 2, 3) denote the lower density of Pi in P, respectively.
It is proved that if δ(P1) > 5/8, δ(P2) ≥ 5/8, and δ(P3) ≥ 5/8, then
for every suﬃciently large odd integer n, there exist pi ∈ Pi such that
n = p1 + p2 + p3. The condition is the best possible.

Keywords. the ternary Goldbach problem; positive density; transference prin-
ciple.

1 Introduction

The ternary Goldbach conjecture states that every odd positive integer greater
than 5 can be written as sums of three primes. It was ﬁrst proposed from an
exchange of letters between Goldbach and Euler in 1742. Until 1923, Hardy
and Littlewood [11] claimed it is true for suﬃciently large positive odd integers,
depending on the generalised Riemann hypothesis (GRH). Instead, in 1937, I.
M. Vinogradov [7] showed for the ﬁrst time a nontrivial estimate of exponential
sums over primes, and solved this problem unconditionally. It should be noted
that, recently, H. A. Helfgott [8, 9, 10] (2014) has completely proved the ternary
Goldbach conjecture for every odd integer n greater than 5.

The main idea used above is circle method which is founded by Hardy and
Littlewood. On the other hand, B. Green proposed the transference principle,
and now it is playing an increasing important role in number theory [2, 3].
Employing this method, H. Li and H. Pan extended [4] (2010) the Vinogradov’s
three primes theorem to a density version. Let P denote the set of all primes.
For a subset A ⊂ P, the lower density of A in P is deﬁned by

δ(A) = lim inf
N→∞

|A ∩ [1, N ]|
|P ∩ [1, N ]|

.

They stated that if P1, P2, P3 are three subsets of P satisfying that

δ(P1) + δ(P2) + δ(P3) > 2,

then for every suﬃciently large odd integer n, there exist pi ∈ Pi (i = 1, 2, 3)
such that n = p1 + p2 + p3.

Motivated by the work of Li and Pan, X. Shao proved [5] (2014) that if A is

a subset of P with

δ(A) >

5
8

,

then for every suﬃciently large odd integer n, there exist pi ∈ A (i = 1, 2, 3)
such that n = p1 + p2 + p3. It is worth mentioning that X. Shao gave [6] (2014)
an l-function-free proof of Vinogradov’s three primes theorem.

This paper is to revise Shao’s method, and show the following result.

Theorem 1.1 Let P1, P2, P3 be three subsets of P, satisfying that

δ(P1) >

5
8

, δ(P2) ≥

5
8

, δ(P3) ≥

5
8

.

Then for every suﬃciently large odd integer n, there exist pi ∈ Pi (i = 1, 2, 3)
such that n = p1 + p2 + p3.

Note that Theorem 1.1 in [5] can be immediately obtained from the above
theorem. We remark that the condition in Theorem 1.1 cannot be improved, and
the counterexample can be seen in [5]. Here we provide another counterexample.
Let P1 = P2 = P3 = {n ∈ P |n ≡ 1, 4, 7, 11, 13 (mod 15)}. Note that δ(P1) =
δ(P2) = δ(P2) = 5/8, but N ≡ 2 (mod 15) cannot be written by p1 + p2 + p3
with pi ∈ Pi (i = 1, 2, 3).

The key to our proof is the following theorem:

Theorem 1.2 Let n ≥ 6 be an even number. Let {ai}, {bi}, {ci} (0 ≤ i < n)
are three decreasing sequences of real numbers in [0, 1]. Let A, B, C denote the
averages of {ai}, {bi}, {ci}, respectively. Suppose that for all triples (i, j, k) with
0 ≤ i, j, k < n and i + j + k ≥ n, we have

Then we have

aibj + bjck + ckai ≤

AB + BC + CA ≤

(ai + bj + ck).

(A + B + C).

It was [5, Lemma 2.2] with the condition n ≥ 10, which could only deduce
Theorem 1.1 with Pi = A (i = 1, 2, 3). X. Shao remarked there exists the
numerical evidence for the conditon n ≥ 6. In this paper, we verify its truth
and apply it as the critical step which enables the argument of Shao to be valid
for the general case.

Theorem 1.2 can deduce the following

Theorem 1.3 Let 0 < δ < 5/32 and 0 < η < 2δ/5 be parameters. Let m
m → [0, 1] be functions

be a square-free positive odd integer. Let f1, f2, f3 : Z∗

m with x = a + b + c such that

f1(a)f2(b)f3(c) > 0, f1(a) + f2(b) + f3(c) >

.

Theorem 1.3 is crucial for applying transference principle in section 4. It also
asserts that A + B + C must cover all residue classes modulo m for any square-
free odd m, provided that A, B, C ⊂ Z∗
m with δ(A) > 5/8, δ(B) ≥ 5/8, δ(C) ≥
5/8, where δ(A) denotes the density of A in Z∗
m. It is the following Corollary
1.4, which extends [5, Corollary 1.5]. Note that if m is a prime, Corollary
1.4 can be immediately proved by the Cauchy-Davenport-Chowla theorem [12],
which asserts that if A, B, C are subsets of Zp for prime p, then |A + B + C|
≥ min(|A| + |B| + |C| − 2, p). However, we cannot assure whether the Cauchy-
Davenport-Chowla theorem is valid for arbitrary integer m.

If A, B, C ⊂ Z∗

m, denote by fi(x) (x = 1, 2, 3) the char-
acteristic functions of A, B, C, respectively. Then by Theorem 1.3 we have the
following

m are subsets of Z∗

Corollary 1.4 Let m be a square-free positive odd integer. Let A1, A2, A3 be
three subsets of Z∗
8 φ(m) (i = 2, 3). Then
A1 + A2 + A3 = Zm.

8 φ(m), and |Ai| ≥ 5

m with |A1| > 5

2 Proof of Theorem 1.2

We ﬁrst make the change of the variables xi = 16
5 bi − 1, zi =
16
5 ci−1. Note that {xi}, {yi}, {zi} are three decreasing sequences of real numbers
in [−1, 2.2]. Let X, Y, Z denote the averages of {xi}, {yi}, {zi}, respectively.

5 ai − 1, yi = 16

Now our goal is to conﬁrm that if

xiyj + yjzk + zkxi ≤ 3

(1)

for all 0 ≤ i, j, k < n with i + j + k ≥ n, then

XY + Y Z + ZX ≤ 3.

Write n = 2m and

Xi=m

Deﬁne M ={(i, j, k)|0 ≤ i, j < m, m ≤ k ≤ n − 1, i + j + k ≡ 0 (mod m)}. Note
that all of the elements in M except (0, 0, m) satisfy (1), and #(M) = m2. We
have

(xiyj + yjzk + zkxi) − (x0y0 + y0zm + zmx0) ≤ 3(m2 − 1).

X(i,j,k)∈M

3

Noting also that if two of the variables i, j, k are ﬁxed, then the third is uniquely
determined by the condition i + j + k ≡ 0 (mod m). Thus, we have

X(i,j,k)∈M

It follows that

(xiyj + yjzk + zkxi) = X0Y0 + Y0Z1 + Z1X0.

X0Y0 + Y0Z1 + Z1X0 ≤ 3(m2 − 1) + (x0y0 + y0zm + zmx0).

Similarly,

X0Y1 + Y1Z0 + Z0X0 ≤ 3(m2 − 1) + (x0ym + ymz0 + z0x0),
X1Y0 + Y0Z0 + Z0X1 ≤ 3(m2 − 1) + (xmy0 + y0z0 + z0xm).

By the above three inequalities, we claim that

n2(XY + Y Z + ZX)
= (X0 + X1)(Y0 + Y1) + (Y0 + Y1)(Z0 + Z1) + (Z0 + Z1)(X0 + X1)
≤ 9(m2 − 1) + (x0y0 + y0zm + zmx0) + (x0ym + ymz0 + z0x0)+
+ (xmy0 + y0z0 + z0xm) + X1Y1 + Y1Z1 + Z1X1.

(2)

For convenience, write

U = (x0 + xm)(y0 + ym) + (y0 + ym)(z0 + zm) + (z0 + zm)(x0 + xm),
∆0 = x0y0 + y0z0 + z0x0,
∆m = xmym + ymzm + zmxm,

∆m,0 = xmz0 + ymz0 + ymx0 + zmx0 + xmy0 + zmy0.

Then (2) can be denoted by

n2(XY + Y Z + ZX) ≤ 9(m2 − 1) + U − ∆m + X1Y1 + Y1Z1 + Z1X1.

(3)

It follows from (1) that

xmym + ymz0 + z0xm ≤ 3,
xmy0 + y0zm + zmxm ≤ 3,
x0ym + ymzm + zmx0 ≤ 3.

Then we have

Together with (2), we have

∆m,0 ≤ 9 − ∆m.

(4)

n2(XY + Y Z + ZX) ≤ 9m2 + ∆0 − ∆m + X1Y1 + Y1Z1 + Z1X1.

(5)

In fact, we will apply inequalities (3) and (5) repeatedly later.

′

Deﬁne M
from (1) that

={(i, j, k) : m ≤ i, j, k < n, i + j + k ≡ 0 (mod m)}. It follows

(xiyj + yjzk + zkxi) − (xmym + ymzm + zmxm) ≤ 3(m2 − 1).

X(i,j,k)∈M′

As has been done previously, we can deduce that

X1Y1 + Y1Z1 + Z1X1 − ∆m

(xiyj + yjzk + zkxi) − (xmym + ymzm + zmxm)

= X(i,j,k)∈M′

≤ 3(m2 − 1).

(6)

Write r = x0 + xm, s = y0 + ym, t = z0 + zm. We may assume that r + s ≥ 0,
s + t ≥ 0, t + r ≥ 0. In fact, if at least one is negative, say r + s < 0, then

U = rs + st + tr ≤ rs − 2(r + s) = (r − 2)(s − 2) − 4 ≤ (−4) × (−4) − 4 = 12. (7)

Note that (3), (6), and (7) together can deduce XY + Y Z + ZX ≤ 3. It means
the lemma has been true. Hence, we only need to consider the case r + s ≥ 0,
s + t ≥ 0, t + r ≥ 0. We can see that U is an increasing function with the
variables r, s, t.

We next consider four cases.

Case 1.

If X1, Y1, Z1 < 0. Considering the inequality (3), we note that
X1Y1 + Y1Z1 + Z1X1 is decreasing with the variables X1, Y1, Z1. Then we have

X1Y1 + Y1Z1 + Z1X1
≤ [xm − (m − 1)][ym − (m − 1)] + [ym − (m − 1)][zm − (m − 1)]+
+ [zm − (m − 1)][xm − (m − 1)]
≤ 3(m − 1)2 − 2(m − 1)(xm + ym + zm) + ∆m.

Since U is increasing, we have

U ≤ (2.2 + xm)(2.2 + ym) + (2.2 + ym)(2.2 + zm) + (2.2 + zm)(2.2 + xm)

≤ 14.52 + 4.4(xm + ym + zm) + ∆m.

Together with ∆m ≤ 3 by (1), we have

U − ∆m + X1Y1 + Y1Z1 + Z1X1 ≤ 17.52 + 3(m − 1)2 − (2m − 6.4)(xm + ym + zm).

If m = 3, we bound the term xm + ym + zm by 2.2 × 3 trivially. Then

U − ∆m + X1Y1 + Y1Z1 + Z1X1 ≤ 3m2 − 19m + 63 ≤ 3m2 + 6.

If m ≥ 4, note that the term xm + ym + zm is greater than −1 × 3. Then

U − ∆m + X1Y1 + Y1Z1 + Z1X1 ≤ 3m2 + 2.

5

Hence, it follows from (3) that XY + Y Z + ZX ≤ 3 for all m ≥ 3.

Case 2.

If exactly two of X1, Y1, Z1 are negative, say X1 < 0, Y1 < 0,
and Z1 ≥ 0. Now we consider the inequality (5). Since Y1Z1, Z1X1 are both
nonpositve, we have

X1Y1 + Y1Z1 + Z1X1 ≤ X1Y1.

Noting that X1, Y1 < 0, then X1Y1 is trivially bounded by [xm − (m − 1)][ym −
(m − 1)]. Hence,

X1Y1 + Y1Z1 + Z1X1 − ∆m
≤ −(m − 1)(xm + ym) + (m − 1)2 − (ymzm + zmxm)
≤ 2(m − 1) + (m − 1)2 − zm(ym + xm)
≤ m2 − 1 + 2 × 2.2.

The second inequality above holds since zm ≥ 0 when Z1 ≥ 0. Together with
∆0 ≤ 3 × 2.22 and (5), we have n2(XY + Y Z + ZX) ≤ 10m2 + 18 ≤ 12m2
(m ≥ 3). Hence, we have XY + Y Z + ZX ≤ 3.

Case 3.

If exactly one of X1, Y1, Z1 are negative, say X1 < 0, Y1 ≥ 0,
and Z1 ≥ 0. And suppose at least one of X1+ Y1 and X1 + Z1 is nega-
tive. We may assume X1+ Y1 < 0. Since the term X1Y1 + Y1Z1 + Z1X1 =
(X1 + Y1)Z1 + X1Y1 ≤ 0, we can ignore it in (5). Noting that at most two terms
of ∆m are nonpostive, we have −∆m ≤ 2.22 × 2. Together with ∆0 ≤ 3 × 2.22,
it follows that n2(XY + Y Z + ZX) ≤ 9m2 + 5 × 2.22 ≤ 12m2 (m ≥ 3). This
leads to XY + Y Z + ZX ≤ 3.

Case 4. If X1+ Y1, Y1 + Z1, and Z1 + X1 are all nonnegative. Therefore,
xm + ym, ym + zm, and zm + xm are all nonnegative. Noting that X1Y1 + Y1Z1 +
Z1X1 is increasing with variables X1, Y1, Z1, we have

X1Y1 + Y1Z1 + Z1X1 ≤ m2∆m.

(8)

Write E = x0 + y0 − 5(xm + ym), F = y0 + z0 − 5(ym + zm), G = z0 + x0 −
5(zm + xm). Four more cases are considered below:

(i) Suppose E, F, G are all negative. Note that

[x0 + y0 − 5(xm + ym)](z0 − zm) ≤ 0.

Upon expanding, it follows that

(x0z0 + y0z0) + 5(xmzm + ymzm) ≤ x0zm + y0zm + 5(xmz0 + ymz0).

Similarly, we have

(y0x0 + z0x0) + 5(ymxm + zmxm) ≤ y0xm + z0xm + 5(ymx0 + zmx0),
(z0y0 + x0y0) + 5(zmym + xmym) ≤ z0ym + x0ym + 5(zmy0 + xmy0).

6

Combining the inequalities above, we have

∆0 + 5∆m ≤ 3∆m,0.

Together with (4), we have

Noting that ∆m ≤ 3 by (1), (5), (8), and (9) together can deduce that

∆0 + 8∆m ≤ 27.

(9)

n2(XY + Y Z + ZX) ≤ 9m2 + ∆0 + (m2 − 1)∆m
≤ 9m2 + (m2 − 9)∆m + 27
≤ 12m2

for m ≥ 3, which implies XY + Y Z + ZX ≤ 3.

(ii) If exactly two of E, F, G are negative, say E, F < 0, and G ≥ 0. We can

see that

[x0 + y0 − 5(xm + ym)][z0 + x0 − 5(zm + xm)] ≤ 0.

Upon expanding, we have

∆0 + 25∆m + (x0 − 5xm)2 ≤ 5∆m,0,

which implies that ∆0 + 25∆m ≤ 5∆m,0. Combining it with (4), we have

Then we have

∆0 + 30∆m ≤ 45.

∆0 + (m2 − 1)∆m ≤

≤ 2m2 − 16 ≤ 3m2.

Together with (5) and (8), we have n2(XY + Y Z + ZX) ≤ 12m2, which leads
to XY + Y Z + ZX ≤ 3.

7

(iii) If exactly one of E, F, G is negative, say E < 0, F ≥ 0, and G ≥ 0. The

proof is similar to the case (ii).

(iv) If E, F, G are all nonnegative. Note that xmym ≤ ( xm+ym

)2, x0 + y0 ≥

5(xm + ym) and xm + ym ≥ 0 by X1 + Y1 ≥ 0, then we have

xmym ≤ (

x0 + y0

10

)2 ≤ 0.442.

2

Similarly, we have ymzm ≤ 0.442 and zmxm ≤ 0.442.
It implies that ∆m ≤
3 × 0.442 ≤ 1. We have trivially ∆0 ≤ 3 × 2.22. By (5) and (8), we have
n2(XY + Y Z + ZX) ≤ 10m2 + 14 ≤ 12m2 which implies XY + Y Z + ZX ≤ 3.
This completes the proof.

Here we remark that for n ≥ 6, the constant 5/8 can be slightly improved.

3 Proof of Theorem 1.3

The argument of the proof is similar to that in [5]. Using Theorem 1.2 we can
show that

Lemma 3.1 Let 0 < δ < 5/32 and 0 < η < 2δ/5 be parameters. Let m be a
square-free positive integer with (m, 30) = 1. Let f1, f2, f3 : Z∗

Then for every x ∈ Zm, there exist a, b, c ∈ Z∗

m with x = a + b + c, such that

f1(a)f2(b) + f2(b)f3(c) + f3(c)f1(a) >

5
8

(f1(a) + f2(b) + f3(c)).

Proof. The proof will proceed by induction. First consider the base case when
m = p is prime. It could prove the conclusion only for p ≥ 11 while f1, f2, f3
might be diﬀerent [5, Proposition 3.1] and for p ≥ 7 with the constraint condition
f1 = f2 = f3. Now by Theorem 1.2, we are able to show the case that f1, f2, f3
need not to be the same for p ≥ 7. Let a0 ≥ a1 ≥ · · · ≥ ap−2 be p − 1 values
of f1(x) (x ∈ Z∗
p) in decreasing order. Similarly, deﬁne b0 ≥ b1 ≥ · · · ≥ bp−2 for
f2(x) (x ∈ Z∗
p). Let A, B, C denote
the averages of {ai}, {bi}, {ci}, respectively. We can deduce that

To prove it, we make the change of the variables X = 16

I = {x : f1(x) ≥ ai}, J = {x : f2(x) ≥ bj}, K = {x : f3(x) ≥ ck}.

Since {ai}, {bi}, {ci} are decreasing, we have

|I| + |J| + |K| ≥ (i + 1) + (j + 1) + (k + 1) ≥ p + 2.

(11)

By the Cauchy-Davenport-Chowla theorem, it follows from (11) that

I + J + K = Zp.

That means for any x ∈ Zp, there exist a ∈ I, b ∈ J, c ∈ K such that x = a+b+c.
From the deﬁnition of I, J, K, we can see that

f1(a) ≥ ai, f2(b) ≥ bj, f3(c) ≥ ck.

Write h(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx − 5
with variables x, y, z on the area

8 (x + y + z). Note that h(x, y, z) is increasing

D = {0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1 : x + y ≥

8

In fact, (10) implies ai +bj ≥ 5
8 (ai +
bj). But it is impossible since 0 ≤ ai, bj ≤ 1. Similarly, we have bj + ck ≥ 5
8 ,
and ck + ai ≥ 5

8 . Otherwise aick +bjck ≤ 5

8 ck, then aibj > 5

8 . Hence, we have

h(f1(a), f2(b), f3(c)) ≥ h(ai, bj, ck) > 0,

which implies

f1(a)f2(b) + f2(b)f3(c) + f3(c)f1(a) >

This completes the proof.

This completes the proof.

4 Sketch of the proof of Theorem 1.1

The proof is almost same as in [5]. Therefore, we omit the details. Theorem 1.1
can be deduced from the following transference principle Proposition 4.1.

For f : ZN → C, we deﬁne the Fourier transform of f by

f (r) = Xx∈ZN

f (x)eN (rx), r ∈ ZN ,

where eN (y) = exp(2πiy/N ).

Proposition 4.1 Let N be a suﬃciently large prime. Suppose that µi : ZN →
R+ and ai : ZN → R+ (i = 1, 2, 3) are functions satisfying the majorization
condition

0 ≤ ai(n) ≤ µi(n),

and the mean condition

min(δ1, δ2, δ3, δ1 + δ2 + δ3 − 1) ≥ δ

for some δ > 0, where δi = Xx∈ZN

also satisfy the pseudorandomness conditions

ai(x) (i = 1, 2, 3). Suppose that µi and ai

|ˆµi(r) − δr,0| ≤ η, r ∈ ZN ,

where δr,0 is the Kronecker delta, and

||ˆai||q = Xr∈ZN

|ˆai(r)|q!1/q

≤ M

11

for some 2 < q < 3 and η, M > 0. Then for any x ∈ ZN , we have

a1(y)a2(z)a3(x − y − z) ≥

c(δ)
N

Xy,z∈ZN

for some constant c(δ) > 0 depending only on δ, provided that η ≤ η(δ, M, q) is
small enough.

Proof. See [5, Proposition 4.1].

Let n be a very large positive odd integer. The aim is to show there exist
p1 ∈ P1, p2 ∈ P2, and p3 ∈ P3 such that n = p1 + p2 + p3.
In the case of
Theorem 1.1, we note that there exist 0 < δ < 5/12 and 0 < η < δ/50 such that

|P1 ∩ [1, N ]| > (

|Pi ∩ [1, N ]| > (

(14)

The rest part of the proof is just like the proof in [5]. Applying (14), one
can conﬁrm the mean condition in Proposition 4.1. The pseudorandomness
conditions hold by Lemma 6.2 and Lemma 6.6 in [2]. The majorization condition
is satisﬁed immediately from the deﬁnitions of ai and µi. Then the transference
principle is applied, leading to Theorem 1.1. Here we want to refer readers to
section 4 of [5] for further details.
