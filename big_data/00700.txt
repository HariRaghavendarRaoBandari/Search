Prolongation of Tanaka structures: an alternative

approach

Dmitri Alekseevsky and Liana David

March 3, 2016

Dedicated to the 150th anniversary of the Romanian Academy

Abstract: The classical theory of prolongations of G-structures was generalized by
N. Tanaka to a wide class of geometrical structures (Tanaka structures), which are deﬁned
on a non-holonomic distribution. Examples of Tanaka structures include subriemannian,
subconformal, CR structures, structures associated to second order diﬀerential equations
and structures deﬁned by gradings of Lie algebras (in the framework of parabolic geome-
tries). Tanaka’s prolongation procedure associates to a Tanaka structure of ﬁnite order
a manifold with an absolute parallelism. It is a very fruitful method for the description
of local invariants, investigation of the automorphism group and equivalence problem. In
this paper, we develop an alternative constructive approach for Tanaka’s prolongation
procedure, based on the theory of quasi-gradations of ﬁltered vector spaces, G-structures
and their torsion functions.

Key words: G-structures, Tanaka structures, prolongations, automorphism groups,

quasi-gradations, torsion functions.

Introduction

Recall that a G-structure of an n-dimensional manifold M is a principal subbundle
πG : PG → M of the frame bundle of M with structure group G ⊂ GL(V ), V = Rn.
Any tensor ﬁeld which is inﬁnitesimally homogeneous, i.e. whose value at any point has
the same normal form with respect to some (”admissible”) frame, is identiﬁed with a
G-structure, whose total space PG is the set of all such admissible frames.
The prolongation of G-structures (see e.g. [9], Chapter VII) is a powerful method in dif-
ferential geometry which associates, in a canonical way, to any G-structure πG : PG → M
of ﬁnite order a new manifold P = P (πG) (the full prolongation), with an absolute
parallelism (i.e. an {e}-structure), with the important property that the group of auto-
morphisms Aut(P, {e}) of (P, {e}) is isomorphic to the group of automorphisms Aut(πG)
of πG. Therefore, (P, {e}) provides local invariants for πG (see [9], Theorem 4.1 of Chapter
VII) and, together with Kobayashi’s theorem (see [4], Theorem 3.2 of Chapter 0) implies
that Aut(πG) ≃ Aut(P, {e}) are Lie groups of dimension less or equal to the dimension
of P .

The full prolongation P of πG : PG → M is deﬁned by consecutive applications of the
ﬁrst prolongation. We brieﬂy recall its construction. It is based on the observation that

the bundle j1(πG) : J 1PG = Hor(PG) → PG of 1-jets of sections of πG (i.e. horizontal
subspaces of T PG) is a G-structure with structure group

G1 = id + Hom(V, g) = {(cid:18)id 0

id(cid:19) , A. ∈ Hom(V, g)},

A.

which is a commutative subgroup of GL(V +g). Using the torsion functions of j1(πG), one
can reduce j1(πG) to a G-structure π(1)
G → PG, whose structure group G(1) is the Lie
subgroup of G1 generated by the Lie subalgebra g(1) = Hom(V, g)∩(V ⊗S2V ∗) ⊂ gl(V +g).
The G-structure π(1)
G is called the ﬁrst prolongation of πG. If the k-th iterated prolongation
g(k) := (g(k−1))(1) of the Lie algebra g = Lie(G) vanishes, then G is called of ﬁnite order
and the k-th iterated P (k)
G ﬁrst prolongation of PG deﬁnes an absolute parallelism on the
full prolongation P := P (k−1)

G : P (1)

While the prolongation procedure works eﬀectively for G-structures of ﬁnite order
(e.g. conformal of quaternonic) there are other important geometric structures (e.g. CR-
structures and other structures deﬁned on a non-integrable distribution), which cannot
be treated eﬀectively by this method. To overcome this diﬃculty, in 1970 Tanaka [12]
generalized the prolongation of G-structures to a larger class of geometric structures,
called Tanaka structures in [1] and inﬁnitesimal ﬂag structures in [3] (see Deﬁnition 15).
Examples of Tanaka structures include CR-structures, sub-Riemannian and subconformal
structures. Tanaka’s prolongation procedure received much attention in the mathemat-
ical literature. There are many approaches for the Tanaka prolongation under diﬀerent
assumptions, see [7, 2, 1, 14, 3]. Our approach is a developing and a detalization of the
approach from [1], where the ﬁrst step of the Tanaka prolongation was explained in detail,
but the other steps were only stated without proofs. To prove the iterative construction,
one has to check many extra conditions, and this will be carefully done in this paper.
Our approach is quite close to the approach of I. Zelenko [14]. The main diﬀerence is
that we develop and systematically use the theory of quasi-gradations of ﬁltered vector
spaces. Together with the well-known theory of Tanaka prolongations of non-positively
graded Lie algebras and the torsion functions of G-structures, this provides a concep-
tual and simple description of each step of the prolongation procedure: the principal
bundle ¯π(n) : ¯P (n) → ¯P (n−1) which relates the n and (n − 1)-prolongations of a given
Tanaka structure is a subbundle of the principal bundle of (n + 1)-quasi-gradations of
T ¯P (n−1) and is obtained as the quotient of a G-structure on ¯P (n−1), with structure group
GnGLn+1(mn−1), with suitable properties of the torsion function. These statements are
explained in detail in Theorem 19. In Theorem 20 we state the ﬁnal result of the Tanaka
prolongation procedure, which reduces the classiﬁcation of Tanaka structures of ﬁnite
order to the well understood classiﬁcation of absolute parallelisms. This requires the con-
struction of a canonical frame on a prolongation of suitable order and a careful analysis
of the behaviour of the automorphisms of a Tanaka structure under the prolongation pro-
cedure. We do this in Propositions 53 and Proposition 54. In the remaining part of the
introduction we present the structure of the paper.

Structure of the paper. Section 2 is intended, in large part, to ﬁx notation. Our
original contribution in this section is the theory of quasi-gradations of ﬁltred vector
spaces (see Subsections 2.2 and 2.3). We recall the deﬁnition of the Tanaka prolongation
of a non-positively graded Lie algebra [12], the basic facts from the theory of G-structures,
including the torsion functions (see e.g. [9]) and the deﬁnition of a Tanaka structure [1].

2

In its highest generality, our deﬁnition of Tanaka structures is more general than the
standard one from the literature (see Deﬁnition 15 and Remark 16).

In Section 3 we state our main results from this paper, namely Theorems 19 and 20.

All notions used in these statements are deﬁned in the previous section.

The remaining part of the paper is devoted to the proofs of Theorems 19 and 20. Let
(Di, πG : PG → M) be a Tanaka G-structure of type m. Basically, the proof of Theorem
19 is divided into two main parts: in a ﬁrst stage, in Section 4 we construct the starting
projection ¯π(1) : ¯P (1) → P = PG of the sequence of projections from Theorem 19 (also
called the ﬁrst prolongation of the Tanaka structure (Di, πG)). For this, we remark that
P has a canonical Tanaka {e}-structure of type m0 (where g0 = Lie(G)) and we deﬁne
the G-structure π1 : P 1 → P as the set of all adapted gradations of T P , or the set of all
frames of T P which lift the canonical graded frames of the Tanaka {e}-structure of P (see
Proposition 21 and Deﬁnition 22). Using the torsion function, we reduce π1 to a subbundle
˜π1 : ˜P 1 → P , with structure group G1GL2(m1), and we deﬁne ¯π(1) : ¯P (1) → P = PG to
be the quotient of ˜π1 by the normal subgroup GL2(m1) (see Deﬁnition 33). To a large
extent (except Subsection 4.2, which provides an alternative argument for the computation
of a certain component of the torsion function of π1), this material is a rewriting of
the construction from [1], using frames instead of coframes (which are more suitable for
the higher steps of the prolongation).
It is also the simplest part of the prolongation
procedure. We skip its details in this introduction and we describe directly the higher
steps of the prolongation, where our new approach using quasi-gradations plays a crucial
role. Therefore, suppose that all projections ¯π(i) : ¯P (i) → ¯P (i−1) (i ≤ n) from Theorem 19
are known. We aim to deﬁne ¯π(n+1) : ¯P (n+1) → ¯P (n).

In Section 5 we deﬁne P n+1 ⊂ Gr(T ¯P (n)) as the set of all adapted gradations of
T ¯H n ¯P (n) (for any ¯H n ∈ ¯P (n)), whose natural projection to T ¯H n−1 ¯P n−1 is compatible with
the quasi-gradation ¯H n ∈ Grn+1(T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1)) (see Deﬁnition 36). We show that the
natural projection πn+1 : P n+1 → ¯P (n) is a G-structure, with structure group ¯G :=
k=0 gk, mn), and we characterize it as a subbundle of the bundle

The deﬁnition of ¯π(n+1) requires a careful analysis of the torsion functions of the
G-structure πn+1. This is done in Sections 6 and 7. In Section 6 we consider an arbi-
trary connection ρ on the G-structure πn+1 : P n+1 → ¯P (n) and we study the component
tρ : P n+1 → Hom((m−1 + gn) ∧ mn, mn) of its torsion function (see Theorem 43). We
deﬁne an action of GnGLn+1(mn−1) on P n+1, with respect to which the soldering form
θn+1 ∈ Ω1(P n+1, mn) of πn+1 is equivariant (see Section 5.2). This is used to treat the
Hom(gn ∧ mn, mn)-valued component of tρ (see Proposition 47). The properties of the
Hom(m−1 ∧ m, mn)-valued component of tρ are consequences of the fact that the canonical
graded frames of the Tanaka {e}-structure on ¯P (n) are Lie algebra isomorphisms when re-
k=0 gk, mn)-valued
component are inherited from the properties of the torsion function of the G-structure
˜πn : ˜P n → ¯P (n−1) (see Proposition 46).

stricted to m (see Proposition 44). The properties of the Hom(m−1 ∧Pn−1

In Section 7 we determine the homogeneous components of tρ which are independent of
the connection ρ and we deﬁne and study the (n + 1)-torsion ¯t(n+1) : P n+1 → Torn+1(mn)
of the Tanaka structure πG (see Deﬁnition 49 and Theorem 50).

In Section 8 we deﬁne the G-structure ˜πn+1 : ˜P n+1 → ¯P (n) and the projection ¯π(n+1) :
¯P (n+1) → ¯P (n) we are looking for. Let W n+1 be a complement of Im(∂n+1) in the space
of torsions Torn+1(mn) (see Theorem 50 for the deﬁnition of the map ∂n+1). The G-

3

Id + gln+1(mn) + Hom(Pn−1

of frames on ¯P (n) (see Lemma 38 and Proposition 39).

structure ˜πn+1 is the restriction of πn+1 to ˜P n+1 = (¯t(n+1))−1(W n+1). We prove that
˜πn+1 has structure group G = Gn+1GLn+2(mn) (see Proposition 51). The bundle ¯π(n+1) :
¯P (n+1) → ¯P (n) is deﬁned as the quotient of ˜πn+1 by the normal subgroup GLn+2(mn) and
satisﬁes all required properties (see Theorem 52). This concludes the proof of Theorem
19.

In Section 9 we prove Theorem 20. The construction of the canonical frame F can on
¯P (¯l) (or on any ¯P (¯l′), for ¯l′ ≥ ¯l), required by Theorem 20 is done in Proposition 53. In
Proposition 54 we show that the automorphism group Aut(Di, πG) of a Tanaka structure
(Di, πG) (not necessarily of ﬁnite order) is isomorphic to the automorphism group of any
of the associated G-structures ˜πn : ˜P n → ¯P (n−1) (n ≥ 1). When (Di, πG) is of ﬁnite
order ¯l, the G-structure ˜π¯l′+1 : ˜P ¯l′+1 → ¯P (¯l′) becomes an absolute parallelism for large
enough ¯l′, which coincides with the canonical frame of ¯P (¯l′) (see Proposition 56). This
fact, combined with Proposition 54 and Kobayashi’s theorem mentioned above, completes
the proof of Theorem 20.

2 Preliminary material

2.1 Adapted gradations of ﬁltred vector spaces

Let V = V−k ⊃ V−k+1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ Vl be a decreasing ﬁltration of a ﬁnite dimensional vector
space V by subspaces Vi. We deﬁne Vj = {0} for j > l and Vj = V for j < −k. For any
m ≥ 0, let

glm(V ) = {A ∈ gl(V ), A(Vi) ⊂ Vi+m}.

The sequence gl0(V ) ⊃ gl1(V ) ⊃ gl2(V ) ⊃ . . . is a ﬁltration of the Lie algebra gl0(V ), i.e.
[gli(V ), glj(V )] ⊂ gli+j(V ), for any i, j. For i ≥ 0, we denote by

GLi(V ) := { B ∈ GL(V ) : B = Id + A , A ∈ gli(V ) }

the Lie group with Lie algebra gli(V ) ⊂ gl(V ).

Any gradation V = H −k + H −k+1 + · · · + H l of V deﬁnes a decreasing ﬁltration

Vi = H i + H i+1 + · · · + H l.

We say that the gradation {H i} is adapted (to the ﬁltration {Vi}). We denote by Gr(V )
the space of all adapted gradations. Let

gli(V ) := {A ∈ gl(V ), A(H j) ⊂ H i+j, ∀j}.

4

The decomposition gl0(V ) = Pi≥0 gli(V ) is a gradation of the Lie algebra gl0(V ), i.e.
[gli(V ), glj(V )] ⊂ gli+j(V ), for any i, j. If V =Pi H i and W =Pi

spaces, then Hom(V, W ) and V ∧ W inherit a gradation

˜H i are graded vector

Homs(V, W ) := {A : V → W, A(H i) ⊂ ˜H i+s, ∀i}

(V ∧ W )s := Xi+j=s

V i ∧ V j.

We denote by Ak ∈ Homk(V, W ) the homogeneous degree k component of A ∈ Hom(V, W ).

2.2 Quasi-gradations of ﬁltred vector spaces

Let V = V−k ⊃ V−k+1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ Vl be a ﬁltred vector space.

Deﬁnition 1. A quasi-gradation of degree m ≥ 1 (or shortly, m-quasi-gradation)
of V is a system of subspaces ¯H = { ¯H i, −k ≤ i ≤ l} such that

i)Vi = ¯H i + Vi+1,

ii) ¯H i ∩ Vi+1 = Vi+m.

We denote by Grm(V ) the set of all m-quasi-gradations of V . Remark that Grm(V ) =

Gr(V ) for any m ≥ k + l + 1. For any 1 ≤ m ≤ p, we deﬁne

Πm

p : Grp(V ) → Grm(V ), Πm

p ( ¯H i) := ¯H i + Vi+m.

In particular, there is a natural projection

Πm : Gr(V ) → Grm(V ), H := {H i} → ¯H := { ¯H i := H i + Vi+m}.

(1)

Deﬁnition 2. Any adapted gradation of V which belongs to Gr ¯H(V ) := (Πm)−1( ¯H) is
called compatible with the quasi-gradation ¯H.

We denote by ¯V = gr(V ) = ¯V −k + ¯V −k+1 + · · · + ¯V l,

graded vector space associated to V . More generally, let gr(m)(V ) :=Pi gri

(m)(V ) := Vi/Vi+m for any i and m ≥ 1. We denote by

¯V i = gri(V ) = Vi/Vi+1 the
(m)(V ), where

(m)(V ), gri

(m) : gri

(m)(V ) → ¯V i

the natural projections. Remark that gri = pri

(1) = gri

(m) for m ≥ k + l + 1.

Any adapted gradation H deﬁnes injective maps bH i : gri(V ) → Vi, with image H i ⊂ Vi

(by means of the decomposition Vi = Vi+1 + H i). The next proposition generalizes this
statement to quasi-gradations.

Proposition 3. i) There is a one to one correspondence between the space Grm(V ) of
m-quasi-gradations ¯H = { ¯H i} and the space of injective maps

f = (f i) : gr(V ) → gr(m)(V ),

where

f i : gri(V ) → gri

Any m-quasi-gradation ¯H ∈ Grm(V ) deﬁnes an injective map b¯H = (b¯H
gr(m)(V ) which satisﬁes (3) and b¯H

(m)(V ).
Conversely, any map f as in (2) and (3) deﬁnes an m-quasi-gradation ¯H = { ¯H i} by

Proof. Let ¯H ∈ Grm(V ). From Deﬁnition 1, Vi/Vi+m = ¯H i/Vi+m + Vi+1/Vi+m (direct sum
decomposition). This induces an isomorphism between gri(V ) = (Vi/Vi+m)/(Vi+1/Vi+m)
and ¯H i/Vi+m ⊂ gri
. More explicitly,

(m)(V ) = Vi/Vi+m, which gives the required map b¯H

associates to a class [y] ∈ ¯V i the unique class [z] ∈ gri

(m)([z]) = [y]
(m)( ¯H i). In a similar way, one can prove that any map f like in (2) and (3),
and [z] ∈ pri
deﬁnes, by (4), an m-quasi-gradation ¯H of V . This proves claim i). Claim ii) follows
easily, from deﬁnitions.

2.3 Lifts and quasi-gradations

In this subsection we present the algebraic setting which underlies our prolongation pro-
cedure of Tanaka structures. It is based on the notion of m-lifts of graded vector space
isomorphisms.

Let m be a graded vector space, V a ﬁltered vector space and u : m → ¯V = gr(V ) a

graded vector space isomorphism.

Deﬁnition 4. A lift of u is a ﬁltration preserving isomorphism F : m → V which satisﬁes
gri ◦ F |mi = u|mi, for any i. More generally, an m-lift (m ≥ 1) is a map F = (F i) : m →
(m) ◦ F i = u|mi, for any i.
gr(m)(V ), where F i : mi → gri
We remark that F is a lift of u if and only if it is ﬁltration preserving and gri ◦ F |mi =
u ◦ πmi|mi, for any i, where πmi : m → mi is the natural projection. The next theorem
generalizes Lemma 7.1 of [1].

(m)(V ) are injective, such that gri

Theorem 5. There is a one to one correspondence between m-quasi-gradations of V and
m-lifts of u. Any m-quasi-gradation ¯H deﬁnes an m-lift, by F i
◦ u|mi. Conversely,
any m-lift F of u deﬁnes an m-quasi-gradation ¯H = { ¯H i := (pri
(m))−1F (mi)} and the lift
of u determined by ¯H coincides with F , i.e. F ¯H = F.
Proof. From its very deﬁnition, F i

¯H = b¯H

(m)(V ) is injective and gri

¯H : mi → gri

¯H = gri

(m) ◦ F i

(m) ◦

◦ u|mi = u|mi. This means that F ¯H is an m-lift, as needed. Conversely, if F is an
m-lift, then F ◦ u−1 : gr(V ) → gr(m)(V ) satisﬁes the properties from Proposition 3. We
deduce that

¯H = { ¯H i}, ¯H i = (pri

(m))−1Im(F ◦ u)i = (pri

(m))−1F (mi)

is an m-quasi-gradation. It remains to prove that F ¯H = F . For this, let x ∈ mi. Since
¯H i = (pri
¯H(x) =

(m) ◦ F i(x) = u(x), we obtain F i

(m))−1F (mi), F (x) ∈ pri

(m)( ¯H i). Since gri

c¯H i(u(x)) = F i(x) as needed (in the second equality we used the deﬁnition of c¯H i).

In view of the above theorem, we identify the space Grm(V ) of m-quasi-gradations
with the space of m-lifts of u. To avoid confusion, lifts of u will be denoted by FH and
m-lifts by F ¯H. The map (1), in terms of lifts, is

Πm : Gr(V ) → Grm(V ), FH := (F i

H ) → F ¯H := (F i

Theorem 6. i) The group GL1(m) acts simply transitively on Gr(V ), by

(F A) := F ◦ A, A ∈ GL1(m),

and the normal subgroup GLm(m) of GL1(m) acts trivially on the ﬁbers of Πm.

ii) The orbit space Gr(V )/GLm(m) is isomorphic to Grm(V ). The quotient group

GL1(m)/GLm(m) acts simply transitively on Grm(V ), by

F ¯H → F ¯H [A],

homogeneous components of A, A0 = Id, and fk+i : grk+i
(m)(V ) are the natural
projections.

(m)(V ) → gri

Proof. We explain the action (7), the other statements being easy. Let F ¯H ∈ Grm(V ) and
choose FH ∈ Gr(V ), such that Πm(FH) = F ¯H . For any x ∈ mi,

2.4 The Tanaka prolongation of a non-positively graded Lie al-

gebra

Let m0 =P−1
negative part m :=P−1

i=−k mi + g0 be a non-positively graded Lie algebra, with Lie bracket [·, ·] and
i=−k mi. We always assume that m is fundamental, i.e. generated
by m−1. In order to deﬁne the Tanaka prolongation of m0, we need to deﬁne inductively
a sequence of vector spaces gl (l ≥ 1). First, we deﬁne

g1 := {A ∈ gl1(m0), A[x, y] = [A(x), y] + [x, A(y)], ∀x, y ∈ m}.

Next, suppose that gs ⊂ gls(ms−1) are known for any 0 ≤ s ≤ l (where mf := m+Pf

for any f ≥ 0). We deﬁne

r=0 gr,

gl+1 := {A ∈ gll+1(ml), A[x, y] = [A(x), y] + [x, A(y)] ∀x, y ∈ m}.

In relation (8) [·, ·] : m × ml → ml extends the Lie bracket [·, ·] of m and

[x, z] = −[z, x] = −z(x),

x ∈ m, z ∈ gs ⊂ gls(ms−1), s ≤ l.

Deﬁnition 7. i) The commutative Lie algebra gl ⊂ gll(ml−1) is called the l-Tanaka
prolongation of m0.

ii) Let G ⊂ GL(m) be a Lie group, with Lie algebra g0. The commutative Lie group

Gl := Id + gl ⊂ gll(ml−1) is called the l-Tanaka prolongation of G.

Remark that any A ∈ gl ⊂ gll(ml−1) annihilates the non-negative part Pl−1

ml−1. Therefore, we may consider gl ⊂ Homl(m, ml−1).

Theorem 8. [12] The vector space (m + g0)∞ has the structure of a graded Lie algebra,
with Lie bracket deﬁned in the following way:

i) the Lie bracket of two elements from m0 is their Lie bracket in the Lie algebra m0;
ii) the Lie bracket of an element x ∈ m and an element z ∈ gs is given by (9).

iii) the Lie bracket on ((m+g0)∞)≥0 =Ps≥0 gs is deﬁned by induction by the condition

[f1, f2](x) = [f1(x), f2] + [f1, f2(x)],

f1 ∈ gs1, f2 ∈ gs2, x ∈ m.

2.5 G-structures

In this section we recall the basic facts we need about connections on G-structures and
their torsion function. More details (including proofs) can be found e.g. in Chapter VII
of [9]. We begin by ﬁxing notation.

Notation 9. Our actions on manifolds are always right actions. If a Lie group G acts on
a manifold P , we denote by Rg : P → P , p → pg the action of g ∈ G on P and by (ξa)P
(or simply ξa) the fundamental vector ﬁeld on P generated by a ∈ Lie(G) = g. For any
u) = (ξAd(g−1)(a))ug and [ξa, ξb] = ξ[a,b]. In particular,
u ∈ P , a, b ∈ g and g ∈ G, (Rg)∗(ξa
if π : P → M is a principal G-bundle and ν : g → T v(P ) the vertical parallelism, then
νug = (Rg)∗ ◦ νu ◦ Ad(g), for any u ∈ P and g ∈ G.

Let π : P → M be a G-structure with structure group G ⊂ GL(V ). Any u ∈ P
is a frame u : V → TpM and the action of g ∈ G on u is given by u · g := u ◦ g. Let
θ ∈ Ω1(P, V ) be the soldering form of π, deﬁned by

θu(X) := (u−1 ◦ π∗)(X), X ∈ TuP.

It is well-known that θ is G-equivariant (see e.g. [9], p. 309):

R∗

g(θ) = g−1 ◦ θ, LξA(θ) = −A ◦ θ,

g ∈ G, A ∈ g.

(10)

Let ρ be a connection on the G-structure π : P → M.

Deﬁnition 10. A ρ-twisted vector ﬁeld is a vector ﬁeld Xa on P (where a ∈ V ), such
that (Xa)u is the ρ-horisontal lift of u(a) ∈ TpM, for any u ∈ P (and p = π(u)).

According to [9] (see p. 356),

(Rg)∗Xa = Xg−1(a), [ξB, Xa] = XB(a),

Deﬁnition 11. The ρ-torsion function is the function

tρ : P → Hom(Λ2(V ), V ), tρ

u(a ∧ b) = (dθ)u(Xa, Xb),

u ∈ P, a ∧ b ∈ Λ2(V ).

(12)

From the deﬁnition of Xa and θ we obtain θ(Xa) = a, for any a ∈ V , and

tρ
u(a ∧ b) = −θu([Xa, Xb]) = −(u−1 ◦ π∗)([Xa, Xb]u),

u ∈ P, a ∧ b ∈ Λ2(V ).

(13)

The next theorem collects various properties we need on the torsion function. It can

be checked directly, using (10) and (11).

Theorem 12. i) The torsion function tρ is G-equivariant:

2.6.1 Filtrations of the Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds

Let T M = D−k ⊃ D−k+1 · · · ⊃ Dl (l ≥ −1) be a ﬂag of distributions on a manifold M.
For any p ∈ M, we deﬁne gri(TpM) = Di
the associated graded vector space. We denote by (gri)D : Di → gri(T M) the natural
projection. We assume that the non-positive part {Di, i ≤ 0} deﬁnes a ﬁltration

p := (Di)p/(Di+1)p and gr(TpM) :=Pi gri(TpM)

X (M) = Γ(D−k) ⊃ Γ(D−k+1) ⊃ · · · ⊃ Γ(D0)

of the Lie algebra X (M) of vector ﬁelds on M. Then, for any p ∈ M, gr<0(TpM) :=

Pi<0 gri(TpM) is a graded Lie algebra, with Lie bracket induced by the Lie bracket of

vector ﬁelds. It is called the symbol algebra of D at p. Its Lie bracket will be denoted
{·, ·}p or just {·, ·} (when p is understood). The following simple lemma will be useful
and can be checked directly.

Lemma 13. Let f : N → M be a smooth map and {DM

2.6.2 Deﬁnition of Tanaka structures

Let m0 = m−k + · · · + m−1 + g0 be a non-positively graded Lie algebra. Associated to m0
are the vector spaces gl and ml = m + g0 + · · · + gl, deﬁned for any l ≥ 1, as in Subsection
2.4.

Deﬁnition 14. The ﬂag of distributions T M = D−k ⊃ D−k+1 · · · ⊃ Dl (l ≥ −1) deﬁnes a
ﬁltration of type ml (or shortly, is of type ml), if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

i) for any i, j ≤ 0, [Γ(Di), Γ(Dj)] ⊂ Γ(Di+j);

9

ii) for any p ∈ M, there is an isomorphism u−
p

: m → gr<0(TpM) of graded Lie

algebras;

iii) for any p ∈ M, there is a canonical isomorphism νp : (ml)≥0 → gr≥0(TpM) of

graded vector spaces.

The isomorphism u := u−

p ⊕ νp : ml → gr(TpM) is called a graded frame at p.

The group Aut(m) of automorphisms of the graded Lie algebra m acts simply transi-
tively on the set Pp of graded frames at p ∈ P . We denote by π : P → M the principal
Aut(m)-bundle of graded frames.

Deﬁnition 15. Let {Di, −k ≤ i ≤ l} be a ﬁltration of type ml on a manifold M and
G ⊂ Aut(m) a Lie subgroup of Aut(m). A Tanaka G-structure of type ml on M is a
principal G-subbundle πG : PG → M of the bundle π : P → M of graded frames.

Remark 16. Our deﬁnition of Tanaka structures is more general than the one from [1],
where the Tanaka structures are always of type m, i.e. there are no distributions indexed
by non-negative indices. Our prolongation procedure will be developed only for Tanaka
structures of type m. The above more general deﬁnition is stated merely for convenience,
to simplify the presentation of the data at each step in the induction process.

Deﬁnition 17. A Tanaka G-structure (Di, πG) of type m has order ¯l if ¯l is the minimal
number such that G¯l+1 = Id.

Deﬁnition 18. An automorphism of a Tanaka G-structure (Di, πG : PG → M) of type
ml is a diﬀeomorphism f : M → M with the following properties:

i) it preserves the ﬂag of distributions Di (and induces a map on gr(T M));
ii) for any graded frame u : ml → gr(TpM) from PG, the composition f∗ ◦ u : ml →

gr(Tf (p)M) is also a graded frame from PG.

3 Statement of the main results

With the preliminary material from the previous section, we can now state our main
results from this paper.

Theorem 19. Let (Di, πG : PG → M) be a Tanaka G-structure of type m =P−1
m(g0)∞ = m+Pi≥o gi the Tanaka prolongation of m(g0) = m+g0 (where g0 = Lie(G)) and

Gn = Id + gn the n-prolongation of G. There is a (non-canonical) sequence of principal
Gn-bundles ¯π(n) : ¯P (n) → ¯P (n−1) (n ≥ 1), with the following properties:

i=−k mi,

A) the base ¯P (n−1) has a Tanaka {e}-structure of type mn−1. This means that there is

a ﬂag of distributions {T ¯P (n−1) = ¯D(n−1)

−k ⊃ · · · ⊃ ¯D(n−1)

n−1 } which satisﬁes

[Γ( ¯D(n−1)

i

), Γ( ¯D(n−1)

j

)] ⊂ Γ( ¯D(n−1)

i+j

), i, j ≤ 0,

and for any ¯H n−1 ∈ ¯P (n−1), there is a canonical isomorphism

I ¯H n−1 : mn−1 → gr(T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1))

of graded vector spaces whose restriction to m is a Lie algebra isomorphism.

10

B) The principal bundle ¯π(n) is obtained as the quotient of a G-structure ˜πn : ˜P n →
¯P (n−1), with structure group GnGLn+1(mn−1), by the normal subgroup GLn+1(mn−1). The
G-structure ˜πn is a subbundle of the bundle Gr(T ¯P (n−1)) → ¯P (n−1) of adapted gradations
of T ¯P (n−1) (which is a G-structure, whose frames are lifts of the graded frames from the
Tanaka {e}-structure of ¯P (n−1)). In particular, ¯π(n) : ¯P (n) = ˜P n/GLn+1(mn−1) → ¯P (n−1)
is a subbundle of the bundle Grn+1(T ¯P (n−1)) → T ¯P (n−1) of (n + 1)-quasi-gradations of
T ¯P (n−1).

C) For one (equivalently, any) connection ˜ρ on the G-structure ˜πn, the torsion function

t˜ρ : ˜P n → Hom(m−1 ∧ (

gi), mn−1)

n−1Xi=0

has non-negative homogeneous components and

(t˜ρ

H n)0(a ∧ b) = −[a, b], H n ∈ ˜P n, a ∧ b ∈ m−1 ∧ (

gi).

n−1Xi=0

We reobtain the ﬁnal result of the Tanaka’s prolongation procedure:

Theorem 20. Let (Di, πG : PG → M) be a Tanaka G-structure of type m and order ¯l. The
¯l-Tanaka prolongation ¯P (¯l) admits a canonical {e}-structure. The group of automorphisms
Aut(Di, πG) of (Di, πG) is isomorphic to the group of automorphisms of this {e}-structure.
i=0 gi.

In particular, it is a ﬁnite dimensional Lie group and dimAut(Di, πG) ≤ dim(M)+P¯l

The remaining part of the paper is devoted to the proofs of Theorem 19 and 20.

4 The ﬁrst prolongation of a Tanaka structure

Let (Di, πG : PG → M) be a Tanaka G-structure of type m = m−k + · · · + m−1. In this
section we deﬁne the ﬁrst projection ¯π(1) : ¯P (1) → P = PG from Theorem 19.

4.1 The G-structure π1 : P 1 → P = PG

To simplify notation, we denote by P := PG the total space of πG : PG → M. Let
ν0 : g0 → T v(P ) be the canonical vertical parallelism of πG, where g0 = Lie(G). For any
i ≤ −1, let DP
∗ (Di) and D0 := T v(P ) the tangent vertical bundle of πG. The
:= (πG)−1
i
sequence of distributions

T (P ) = DP

−k ⊃ DP

−k+1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ DP

−1 ⊃ DP
0

(16)

deﬁnes a ﬁltration of the Lie algebra X (P ) of vector ﬁelds on P and the diﬀerential (πG)∗
of induces a symbol algebra isomorphism

(πG)∗ : gr<0(TuP ) → gr(TpM),

u ∈ P, p = πG(u).

(17)

Since g0 ⊂ Der0(m), m0 := m + g0 is a graded Lie algebra. Its Lie bracket [·, ·] extends the
Lie brackets of m and g0, and [a, b] = −[b, a] = −b(a), for any a ∈ m and b ∈ g0 ⊂ End(m).
The next proposition can be checked directly.

11

Proposition 21. Any point u ∈ P deﬁnes an isomorphism

ˆu = (πG)−1

∗ ◦ u + ν0

u : m0 = m + g0 → gr(TuP ) = gr<0(TuP ) + T v

u (P ).

The set of isomorphisms {ˆu, u ∈ P } is a Tanaka {e}-structure of type m0 on P .

Any gradation H = {H i} of TuP adapted to the ﬁltration (16) determines a frame

which lifts the graded frame ˆu : m0 → gr(TuP ) (see Theorem 5). For any a ∈ g0,
FH(a) = (ξa)P

u . From Theorem 6 i) we obtain:

FH : m0 → TuP, FH := bH ◦ ˆu,

(18)

Proposition 22. The principal bundle π1 : P 1 → P of adapted gradations in T P is a
G-structure with structure group GL1(m0).

Deﬁnition 23. The G-structure π1 : P 1 → P is called the G-structure associated to
the Tanaka structure (Di, πG : P → M). It consists of all frames on TuP (for any
u ∈ P ) which are lifts of the canonical graded frame ˆu : m0 → gr(TuP ).

4.2 The action of G on P 1

In this subsection we construct an action of G on P 1 which lifts the action of G on P (the
total space of the principal G-bundle πG). The action of G on P preserves the ﬁltration
(16) and induces an action on gr(T P ): for any g ∈ G,

(Rg)∗ : gr(TuP ) → gr(TugP ),

(Rg)∗([Xu]) = [(Rg)∗(Xu)].

Above [Xu] denotes the class of Xu ∈ (DP

i )u in gri(TuP ). Let

ρ : G → Aut(m0), ρ(g)(a + b) := g(a) + Ad(g)(b),

a ∈ m, b ∈ g0.

(19)

are related by

Proposition 24. i) For any u ∈ P and g ∈ G, the frames ˆu andcug from Proposition 21

(20)

ii) There is an action of G on P 1, which associates to any frame FH : m0 → TuP from
P 1 and g ∈ G the frame

cug = (Rg)∗ ◦ ˆu ◦ ρ(g) : m0 → gr(TguP ).

(FHg) := (Rg)∗ ◦ FH ◦ ρ(g) : m0 → TguP.

(21)

iii) For any a ∈ g0, the fundamental vector ﬁeld (ξa)P 1 generated by a on P 1 is π1-
projectable and (π1)∗(ξa)P 1 = (ξa)P .

Proof. Claim i) follows from the deﬁnition of ˆu,cug, and ν0
u ∈ P and g ∈ G. For claim ii), we check that FHg is a lift of cug (direct computation,

which uses that FH is a lift of ˆu and that ρ is gradation preserving). Claim iii) follows
from Rg ◦ π1 = π1 ◦ Rg.

u ◦ Ad(g), for any

ug = (Rg)∗ ◦ ν0

Lemma 25. The soldering form θ1 ∈ Ω1(P 1, m0) of π1 is G-equivariant:

(Rg)∗θ1 = ρ(g−1) ◦ θ1, L(ξa)P 1 (θ1) = −ρ∗(a) ◦ θ1,

g ∈ G, a ∈ g0.

(22)

12

Proof. From the deﬁnition of θ1, for any XH ∈ TH P 1,

((Rg)∗θ1)(XH) = θ1((Rg)∗XH) = (FH g)−1(π1 ◦ Rg)∗(XH )
= (ρ(g−1) ◦ (FH )−1 ◦ (Rg−1)∗ ◦ (π1 ◦ Rg)∗)(XH)
= (ρ(g−1) ◦ (FH )−1 ◦ (π1)∗)(XH)
= (ρ(g−1) ◦ θ1)(XH),

where we used π1 ◦ Rg = Rg ◦ π1. The second relation (22) is the inﬁnitesimal version of
the ﬁrst.

4.3 The torsion function tρ of π1

Let ρ be a connection on the G-structure π1 : P 1 → P . In this section we study the
properties of the torsion function tρ, in connection with the gradation of m0. We preserve
the notation from Subsection 2.5.
In particular, associated to ρ there is the family of
ρ-twisted vector ﬁelds {Xa, a ∈ m0} on P 1. Recall that for any a ∈ m0, (Xa)H is the
ρ-horisontal lift of FH(a), for any H ∈ P 1. In particular, Xa is the ρ-horisontal lift of
(ξa)P when a ∈ g0.

Proposition 26. The function tρ : P 1 → Hom(Λ2(m0), m0) has only components of non-
negative homogeneous degree.

i

:= (π1)−1

∗ (DP

i ). The sequence {DP 1

Proof. For any i ≤ 0, let DP 1
, i ≤ 0} deﬁnes a
ﬁltration of the Lie algebra X (P 1) of vector ﬁelds on P 1. Since for any H ∈ P 1, FH :
m0 → TuP preserves ﬁltrations, we obtain that Xa ∈ Γ(DP 1
i ), for any a ∈ (m0)i (i ≤ 0).
Similarly, Xb ∈ Γ(DP 1
i+j) and
tρ
H(a, b) = −(FH)−1(π1)∗([Xa, Xb])H) belongs to (m0)i+j.
Theorem 27. i) For any a ∧ b ∈ Λ2(g0) and H ∈ P 1, tρ

j ) for any b ∈ (m0)j (j ≤ 0). It follows that [Xa, Xb] ∈ Γ(DP 1

H(a ∧ b) = −[a, b].

i

ii) For any a ∧ b ∈ Λ2(m0) and H ∈ P 1, (tρ

H )0(a, b) = −[a, b].

Proof. Let a, b ∈ g0. Then Xa, Xb are the ρ-horisontal lifts of the fundamental vector ﬁelds
(ξa)P and (ξb)P on P . Thus, [Xa, Xb] is π1-projectable and (π1)∗[Xa, Xb] = [(ξa)P , (ξb)P ] =
(ξ[a,b])P . We obtain

tρ
H(a, b) = −(FH )−1(π1)∗([Xa, Xb]H ) = −(FH )−1(ξ[a,b])P = −[a, b].

Claim i) follows.

For claim ii), we need to consider the cases: I) a, b ∈ m; II) a ∈ m, b ∈ g0 (for a, b ∈ g0,

claim ii) follows from i)).

Let a ∈ mi and b ∈ mj (i, j < 0). Then Xa ∈ Γ(DP 1

i ) and Xb ∈ Γ(DP 1

j ). Being a lift

of ˆu : m0 → gr(TuP ), the frame FH : m0 → TuP is ﬁltration preserving and satisﬁes

(grs)DP

◦ FH|(m0)s = ˆu ◦ π(m0)s|(m0)s, π(m0)s ◦ (FH)−1|DP

s = ˆu−1 ◦ (grs)DP

(23)

where π(m0)s : m0 → (m0)s and (grs)DP : (Du)P
Using (π1)∗([Xa, Xb]H) ∈ (DP

i+j)u and the second relation (23), we obtain

s → grs(TuP ) are natural projections.

(tρ

H)0(a ∧ b) = −π(m0)i+j (FH)−1(π1)∗([Xa, Xb]H)
(π1)∗([Xa, Xb]H).

= −ˆu−1 ◦ (gri+j)DP

(24)

13

On the other hand, from Lemma 13 and the ﬁrst relation (23), we obtain

(gri+j)DP

(π1)∗([Xa, Xb]H) = {((gri)DP

◦ FH)(a), ((grj)DP

◦ FH)(b)}

= {ˆu(a), ˆu(b)}.

(25)

Using that ˆu : m → gr−(TuP ) is a Lie algebra isomorphism, we deduce, from (24) and
(25), that

(tρ

H )0(a ∧ b) = −ˆu−1({ˆu(a), ˆu(b)}) = −[a, b],

as needed.

It remains to consider a ∈ g0 and b ∈ m. We now use the action of G on P 1, deﬁned
in Subsection 4.2. From Proposition 24, (ξa)P 1 is π1-projectable and (π1)∗(ξa)P 1 = (ξa)P .
On the other hand, FH(a) = (ξa)P
u , for any H ∈ P 1 (and u = π1(H)). Thus, Xa is the ρ-
horisontal lift of (ξa)P and (π1)∗(Xa) = (ξa)P . Therefore, the vector ﬁeld Y := Xa −(ξa)P 1
is π1-vertical. We write

H (a ∧ b) = −θ1([Xa, Xb]H) = −θ1([(ξa)P 1
tρ

, Xb]H) − θ1([Y, Xb]H ).

(26)

We need to compute the two terms from the right hand side of (26). From Lemma 25
and θ1(Xb) = b,

θ1([(ξa)P 1

, Xb]H) = −(L(ξa)P 1 θ1)H(Xb) = ρ∗(a)(b) = a(b).

In order to compute θ1([Y, Xb]H), we write Y =Ps fs(ξAs)P 1, where fs are functions on

P 1 and {As} is a basis of gl1(m0). Then

H (Xb(fs)(ξAs)P 1
θ1

+ fs[Xb, (ξAs)P 1

])

where in the ﬁrst equality we used that (ξAs)P 1 is π1-vertical (hence annihilated by θ1)
and in the last equality we used the second relation (10). We proved that

tρ
H(a ∧ b) = −a(b) − A(b),

a ∈ g0 ⊂ gl(m), b ∈ m,

(28)

where A = Ps fs(H)As ∈ gl1(m0) is uniquely determined by (Xa)H − (ξa)P 1

H = (ξA)P 1
H .
H (a ∧ b) ∈ (m0)i and (by projecting (28) onto mi)

Assume now that b ∈ mi. From (28), tρ
(tρ
H)0(a, b) = −a(b) = −[a, b] as required.

4.4 Variation of the torsion tρ of π1

For a connection ρ on π1 : P 1 → P , we use the same notation tρ for the torsion function
tρ : P 1 → Hom(Λ2(m0), m0) and its composition (at the right) with the natural projection
from Hom(Λ2(m0), m0) onto its various components.

Proposition 28. i) The degree zero homogeneous component of tρ : P 1 → Hom(g0 ∧
m, m0) is independent of ρ.

ii) The degree zero and one homogeneous components of tρ : P 1 → Hom(Λ2(m), m) are

independent of ρ.

Proof. Let ρ′ be another connection on π1. For any a ∈ m0, the ρ and ρ′-twisted vector
ﬁelds Xa and X ′
H , where
A ∈ gl1(m0) (the Lie algebra of the structure group GL1(m0) of π1). Similarly, for any
b ∈ m0, (X ′

a, at a point H ∈ P 1, are related by (X ′

H , where B ∈ gl1(m0). From Theorem 12,

a)H = (Xa)H + (ξA)P 1

b)H = (Xb)H + (ξB)P 1

tρ′
H (a ∧ b) = tρ

H (a ∧ b) − A(b) + B(a).

(29)

Let a ∈ g0 and b ∈ mi (i < 0). Then B(a) = 0, deg(A(b)) ≥ i + 1. We obtain that the
m1-component of A(b) − B(a) vanishes. Claim i) follows. Let a ∈ mi and b ∈ mj with
i, j < 0. Then deg(A(b)) ≥ j + 1 > i + j + 1 and deg(B(a)) ≥ i + 1 > i + j + 1 (because
i, j < 0). We obtain that the mi+j and mi+j+1-components of A(b) − B(a) vanish. Claim
ii) follows.

We denote by Tor(m0) := Hom(Λ2(m), m0) the space of torsions. It is a graded vector

space, with gradation Torm(m0) = Pi,j Hom(mi ∧ mj, (m0)i+j+m). For any H ∈ P 1, we

denote by (tρ
Deﬁnition 29. Let ρ be a connection on the G-structure π1 : P 1 → P associated to the
Tanaka structure πG : PG → M. The function

H )m the projection of tρ

H onto Torm(m0).

t1 : P 1 → Tor1(m0), P 1 ∋ H → t1

H := (tρ

H )1 ∈ Tor1(m0)

is called the torsion function of the Tanaka structure (Di, πG).
Proposition 30. The torsion function t1 is independent of the choice of ρ. It is given
by:

t1
H(a, b) = −(FH )−1(π1)∗([Xa, Xb]H)mi+j+1, H ∈ P 1, a ∈ mi, b ∈ mj

(30)
where Xa, Xb ∈ X (P 1) are ρ-twisted vector ﬁelds (and ρ is an arbitrary connection on
π1).

Proof. The ﬁrst claim follows from Proposition 28 ii). Relation (30) follows from (13).
Proposition 31. For any H ∈ P 1 and A = Id + A1 ∈ GL1(m0),

t1
HA = t1

H + ∂A.

Above, ∂A ∈ Hom(Λ2m, m0) is given by
(∂A)(a ∧ b) := A1

(31)
Proof. Since A−1 ∈ GL1(m0), it is of the form A−1 = Id + ˜A1, where ˜A1 ∈ gl1(m0) and
˜A1
1 (easy check). We choose a connection ρ on π1. From Theorem 12, for any
a ∧ b ∈ Λ2(m),

1 = −A1

Suppose now that a ∈ mi and b ∈ mj (i, j < 0). Projecting the above equality to
mi+j+1 and using that tρ has only components of non-negative homogeneous degree (see
Proposition 26), we obtain

t1
HA(a ∧ b) = t1
Using ˜A1

4.5 The ﬁrst prolongation

Let (Di, π : PG → M) be a Tanaka G-structure of type m = m−k + · · · + m−1, π1 : P 1 → P
the associated G-structure and t1 : P 1 → Tor1(m0) the torsion function. Let

∂ : gl1(m0) → Tor1(m0), (∂A)(a ∧ b) = A1([a, b]) − [A1(a), b] − [a, A1(b)], a, b ∈ m. (32)

Fix a complement W of ∂(gl1(m0)) in Tor1(m0).
Proposition 32. The bundle ˜π1 : ˜P 1 := (t1)−1(W ) → P is a G-structure with structure
group G1GL2(m0). For any connection ˜ρ on ˜π1, its torsion function

t˜ρ : ˜P 1 → Hom(m−1 ∧ g0, m0)

takes values in Hom(m−1 ∧ g0, m−1 + g0) (i.e. has only components of non-negative ho-
mogeneous degree) and

(t˜ρ

H )0(a ∧ b) = −[a, b], a ∧ b ∈ m−1 ∧ g0.

Proof. The ﬁrst claim follows from Proposition 31 and Ker(∂) = gl2(m0) + g1. The second
claim follows from Proposition 26 and Theorem 27.

The quotient ¯P (1) = ˜P 1/GL2(m0), with the natural projection ¯π(1) : ¯P (1) → P is a

principal bundle with (abelian) structure group G1.

Deﬁnition 33. The principal G1-bundle ¯π(1) : ¯P (1) → P is called the ﬁrst prolongation
of the Tanaka structure (Di, πG).

The next proposition concludes the ﬁrst induction step from the proof of Theorem 19.

Proposition 34. The projection ¯π(1) : ¯P (1) → P satisﬁes the required properties from
Theorem 19.
In particular, it is canonically isomorphic to a subbundle of the bundle
Gr2(T P ) → P of 2-quasi-gradations of T P.

Proof. From Proposition 21, the base P has a Tanaka {e}-structure, i.e. property A)
from Theorem 19 is satisﬁed. Properties B) and C) follow from Proposition 32 and the
deﬁnition of ¯π(1). The statement about quasi-gradations follows from Theorem 6 ii).

5 The G-structure πn+1 : P n+1 → ¯P (n)
We now assume that the projections ¯π(i) : ¯P (i) → ¯P (i−1) from Theorem 19 are known,
: ¯P (n+1) → ¯P (n) from
for any i ≤ n. Our goal is to construct the projection ¯π(n+1)
this theorem. According to the statement of Theorem 19, ¯P (n) needs to have a Tanaka
{e}-structure of type mn. This is induced from ¯P (n−1), as follows.

I ¯H n−1 : m → gr<0(T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1)) have this property.

5.1 Deﬁnition and basic properties of πn+1
In this section we deﬁne a G-structure πn+1 : P n+1 → ¯P (n) and we study its properties.
Let ¯H n ∈ ¯P (n) and H n+1 = {(H n+1)i, −k ≤ i ≤ n} an adapted gradation of T ¯H n ¯P (n).
It projects to an adapted gradation (¯π(n))∗(H n+1) := {(¯π(n))∗(H n+1)i, −k ≤ i ≤ n − 1}
of T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1) (remark that (H n+1)n = T v( ¯P (n)) projects trivially to T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1)). The
adapted gradations H n+1 and (¯π(n))∗(H n+1) deﬁne frames which lift the canonical graded
frames I ¯H n and I ¯H n−1 respectively (see Theorem 5):

FH n+1 = [H n+1 ◦ I ¯H n : mn → T ¯H n ¯P (n)

F(¯π(n))∗(H n+1) =

\

(¯π(n))∗(H n+1) ◦ I ¯H n−1 : mn−1 → T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1).

(34)

We shall often use the notation F i
F(¯π(n))∗(H n+1)|(mn−1)i (i ≤ n − 1).

H n+1 := FH n+1|(mn)i (i ≤ n) and similarly F i

(¯π(n))∗(H n+1) :=

Deﬁnition 36. The total space P n+1 of πn+1 is the set of all adapted gradations H n+1 of
T ¯H n ¯P (n) (for any ¯H n ∈ ¯P (n)), whose projection (¯π(n))∗(H n+1) to T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1) is compatible
with the quasi-gradation ¯H n ∈ Grn+1(T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1)) (where ¯H n−1 := ¯π(n)( ¯H n)).

More precisely, we set

P n+1 = {H n+1 ∈ Gr(T ¯H n ¯P (n)), Πn+1(¯π(n))∗(H n+1) = ¯H n}

where Πn+1 : Gr(T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1)) → Grn+1(T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1)) is the natural projection (see the
map (1)). From the ﬁrst relation (34), we obtain:

Lemma 37. The natural map πn+1 : P n+1 → ¯P (n) is a G-structure.

In order to determine the structure group of πn+1, we need to describe P n+1 as
a submanifold of the frame manifold of ¯P (n). From Theorem 5, any ¯H n ∈ ¯P (n) ⊂

Grn+1(T ¯P (n−1)) deﬁnes an (n + 1)-lift F ¯H n = c¯H i ◦ I ¯H n−1 : mn → gr(n+1)(T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1))

of I ¯H n−1.
Lemma 38. i) Let H n+1 = {(H n+1)i, −k ≤ i ≤ n} be an adapted gradation of T ¯H n ¯P (n)
and (¯π(n))∗(H n+1) its projection to T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1). The associated frames F(¯π(n))∗(H n+1) and
FH n+1 deﬁned by (34) are related by

F(¯π(n))∗(H n+1) = (¯π(n))∗ ◦ FH n+1|mn−1.

associated frame FH n+1 satisﬁes: for any −k ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and x ∈ (mn−1)i,

Relation (35) follows from (34), (37) and I ¯H n|mn−1 = (¯π(n))−1

For claim ii), let H n+1 ∈ Gr(T ¯H n ¯P (n)). Then H n+1 ∈ P n+1 if and only if (¯π(n))∗(H n+1) ∈
Gr(T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1)) is compatible with the quasi-gradation ¯H n ∈ Grn+1(T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1)). From

group ¯G := Id + gln+1(mn) + Hom(Pn−1

Proof. Let H n+1, ˜H n+1 ∈ (πn+1)−1( ¯H n) be two adapted gradations of T ¯H n( ¯P (n)), whose
projections to T ¯H n−1( ¯P (n−1)) are compatible with the quasi-gradation ¯H n ∈ Grn+1(T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1)).

5.2 An action of GnGLn+1(mn−1) on P n+1
We denote by GnGLn+1(mn−1) the subgroup of GL(mn−1) of all automorphisms of the form
Id + An + An+1, where An ∈ gn ⊂ gln(mn−1) and An+1 ∈ gln+1(mn−1). In this subsection
we deﬁne an action of GnGLn+1(mn−1) on P n+1, naturally related to the action of Gn on
¯P (n) which makes ¯π(n) a principal bundle. Let

Pr : GnGLn+1(mn−1) → Gn,

g = Id + An + An+1 → Pr(g) := ¯g = Id + An.

It is a group homomorphism. For any a ∈ gn + gln+1(mn−1), we denote by ¯a its gn-
component. The natural action of GnGLn+1(mn−1) ⊂ GL(mn−1) on mn−1 will be denoted
(g, vn−1) → g(vn−1). We consider the trivial extension of this action to mn = mn−1 + gn.
A vector from mn will be denoted as vn−1 + v, where vn−1 ∈ mn−1 and v ∈ gn. We obtain
a representation

ρn : GnGLn+1(mn−1) → Aut(mn), ρn(g)(vn−1 + v) := g(vn−1) + v.

(39)

The group GnGLn+1(mn−1) acts on the frame bundle Fr( ¯P (n)) of ¯P (n):
GnGLn+1(mn−1) and frame F : mn → T ¯H n ¯P (n),

for any g ∈

F g := (R¯g)∗ ◦ F ◦ ρn(g) : mn → T ¯H n ¯g

¯P (n).

Proposition 41. The action (40) preserves P n+1 and

(πn+1)∗((ξa)P n+1

) = (ξ¯a) ¯P (n)

,

∀a ∈ gn + gln+1(mn−1).

(40)

(41)

Proof. Let H n+1 ∈ P n+1 and FH n+1 : mn → T ¯H n ¯P (n) the associated frame. We need to
prove that for any g ∈ GnGLn+1(mn−1), the frame

FH n+1g = (R¯g)∗ ◦ FH n+1 ◦ ρn(g) : mn → T ¯H n ¯g

¯P (n)

belongs to P n+1, i.e. satisﬁes the following conditions:

I) It is ﬁltration preserving and lifts I ¯H n ¯g : mn → gr(T ¯H n ¯g

¯P (n)), i.e.

((gri) ¯D(n)

◦ (FH n+1g))(x) = (I ¯H n ¯g ◦ π(mn)i)(x), x ∈ (mn)i,

(42)

where π(mn)i : (mn)i → (mn)i is the natural projection. This means that FH n+1g is the
frame associated to an adapted gradation of T ¯H n ¯g

II) The projection of the adapted gradation from I to T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1) is compatible with

¯P (n).

the quasi-gradation ¯H n¯g ∈ Grn+1(T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n−1)).

Since GnGLn+1(mn−1) ⊂ GL1(mn) and (R¯g)∗ : T ¯H n−1 ¯P (n) → T ¯H n−1¯g

¯P (n) preserves
ﬁltrations, FH n+1g preserves ﬁltrations as well. Using the deﬁnition of FH n+1g, that R¯g
preserves ﬁltrations, (R¯g−1)∗ ◦ I ¯H n ¯g = I ¯H n (which follows from (33) and the fact that gn
is abelian) and

((gri) ¯D(n)

◦ FH n+1)(ρn(g)(x)) = (I ¯H n ◦ π(mn)i)(ρn(g)(x)), x ∈ (mn)i,

(which holds because ρn(g)(x) ∈ (mn)i and FH n+1 lifts I ¯H n), we see that (42) is equivalent
to π(mn)i(ρn(g)(x) − x) = 0, for any x ∈ (mn)i and i ≤ n. This relation is obviously true,
from the deﬁnition of ρn. Condition I is proved.

19

Condition II can be checked in a similar way, using

F i
¯H n ¯g(x) = (fi,n ◦ F i+n

¯H n )(¯g(x)), x ∈ (mn−1)i, i ≤ n − 1

i+n / ¯D(n−1)

where fi,n : ¯D(n−1)
i+n+1 is the natural projection (see Theorem 6
ii)). We proved that (40) deﬁnes an action on P n+1. Relation (41) follows from πn+1◦Rg =
R¯g ◦ πn+1, for any g ∈ GnGLn+1(mn−1).

Let θn+1 : T P n+1 → mn be the soldering form of the G-structure πn+1:

θn+1(X) = (FH n+1)−1((πn+1)∗X),

∀X ∈ TH n+1P n+1.

It is equivariant with respect to the structure group ¯G of πn+1: (Rg)∗(θn+1) = g−1 ◦ θn+1,
for any g ∈ ¯G. The next lemma shows that θn+1 is equivariant also with respect to the
action of GnGLn+1(mn−1) on P n+1 from Proposition 41.

Lemma 42. For any g ∈ GnGLn+1(mn−1) and a ∈ gn + gln+1(mn−1),

(Rg)∗(θn+1) = ρn(g−1) ◦ θn+1, L(ξa)P n+1 (θn+1) = −(ρn)∗(a) ◦ θn+1.

(43)

Proof. The proof is the same as in Lemma 25. For any g ∈ GnGLn+1(mn−1),

(Rg)∗(θn+1)(XH n+1) = θn+1((Rg)∗(XH n+1)) = (FH n+1g)−1((πn+1 ◦ Rg)∗(XH n+1)).

From FH n+1g = (R¯g)∗ ◦ FH n+1 ◦ ρn(g) and R¯g ◦ πn+1 = πn+1 ◦ Rg, we obtain the ﬁrst
relation (43). The second relation (43) is the inﬁnitesimal version of the ﬁrst.

6 The torsion function of πn+1

Let ρ be a connection on the G-structure πn+1 : P n+1 → ¯P (n) and tρ : P n+1 →
Hom(Λ2(mn), mn) the torsion function. We consider the compositions (at the right)
of tρ with the natural projection from Hom(Λ2(mn), mn) onto its various components
Hom((mn)i ∧ (mn)j, mn) and we preserve the notation tρ for the resulting maps. In this
section we prove the following theorem.

Theorem 43. i) The torsion function

tρ : P n+1 → Hom((m−1 + gn) ∧ mn, mn)

has only homogeneous components of non-negative reduced degree, i.e.
P n+1 and −k ≤ i ≤ n,

for any H n+1 ∈

H n+1(m−1 ∧ (mn)i) ⊂ (mn)i−1, tρ
tρ

H n+1(gn ∧ (mn)i) ⊂ (mn)min{n+i,n}.

ii) For any H n+1 ∈ P n+1,

(tρ

H n+1)0(a ∧ b) = −[a, b], ∀a ∧ b ∈ m−1 ∧ mn + gn ∧ m.

We divide the proof of the above theorem into three parts (Subsections 6.1, 6.2 and
i=0 gi), mn) and Hom(gn∧mn, mn)-
∈ X (P n+1) the ρ-twisted

6.3), according to the Hom(m−1∧m, mn), Hom(m−1∧(Pn

valued components of tρ. Along the proof we denote by X n+1
vector ﬁelds (for any a ∈ mn).

6.1 The Hom(m−1 ∧ m, mn)-valued component

This part of Theorem 43 is the easiest and follows from the next proposition.

Proposition 44. The torsion function tρ : P n+1 → Hom(m−1 ∧ m, mn) has only homoge-
neous components of non-negative degree. For any H n+1 ∈ P n+1,

(tρ

H n+1)0(a ∧ b) = −[a, b], ∀a ∧ b ∈ m−1 ∧ m.

(45)

Proof. The argument is similar to the proof of Proposition 26 and Theorem 27 ii) (case I).
For any a ∈ m−1 and b ∈ mi, X n+1

deﬁnes a ﬁltration of the Lie algebra X ( ¯P (n)) and FH n+1 : mn → T ¯H n ¯P (n) is ﬁltration
preserving, we obtain that tρ
]) ∈ (mn)i−1. We
proved the ﬁrst statement of the proposition. It remains to prove (45). Since FH n+1 is a
lift of I ¯H n : mn → gr(T ¯H n ¯P (n)),

H n+1(a ∧ b) = −(FH n+1)−1([X n+1

6.3 The Hom(gn ∧ mn, mn)-valued component
This is the last component of the torsion function tρ which needs to be studied, in order
to conclude the proof of Theorem 43.

Proposition 47. The torsion function tρ : P n+1 → Hom(gn ∧ mn, mn) has non-negative
reduced homogeneous components and satisﬁes

(tρ

H n+1)0(a ∧ b) = −[a, b],

∀a ∧ b ∈ gn ∧ m.

Proof. Let a ∈ gn and b ∈ mn. Recall that GnGLn+1(mn−1) acts on P n+1 (see Proposition
41). Let (ξa)P n+1 be the fundamental vector ﬁeld of this action generated by a ∈ gn ⊂
gn + gln+1(mn−1). From Proposition 41, (πn+1)∗(ξa)P n+1 = (ξa) ¯P (n). On the other hand,
) = (ξa) ¯P (n). We obtain that
X n+1
Y := X n+1

is the ρ-horisontal lift of (ξa) ¯P (n). Thus (πn+1)∗(X n+1
a − (ξa)P n+1 is πn+1-vertical. We write

(56)

We need to compute the two terms from the right hand side of (56). For the ﬁrst term,
we use Lemma 42:

θn+1([(ξa)P n+1

, X n+1

b

]) = −L(ξa)P n+1 (θn+1)(X n+1

b

) = (ρn)∗(a)(b).

(57)

To compute the second term, we remark that, since Y is πn+1-vertical, there is A ∈
H n+1. The soldering form θn+1 of
πn+1 is ¯G-equivariant (see relation (10)). Like in the computation (27) from the proof of
Theorem 27, we obtain

gln+1(mn) + Hom(Pn−1

θn+1([Y, X n+1

]H n+1) = −L(ξA)P n+1 (θn+1)((X n+1

(58)

Relations (56), (57) and (58) imply that

tρ
H n+1(a ∧ b) = −(ρn)∗(a)(b) − A(b),

a ∈ gn, b ∈ mn.

If b ∈ mi (with i ≤ −1) then (ρn)∗(a)(b) = a(b) ∈ (mn−1)i+n and A(b) ∈ (mn)i+n+1. We
deduce that tρ
If b ∈ gk
(0 ≤ k ≤ n) then (ρn)∗(a)(b) = 0 and tρ

H n+1)0(a ∧ b) = −a(b) = −[a, b].

H n+1(a ∧ b) ∈ (mn)i+n and (tρ

H n+1(a ∧ b) = −A(b) ∈ gn.

The proof of Theorem 43 is now completed.

7 Variation of the torsion tρ of πn+1

In this section we deﬁne the (n + 1)-torsion and we study its behaviour under the action
of ¯G on P n+1. We preserve the setting from Section 6.

Proposition 48. i) Let 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The homogeneous component (tρ)i of degree i of
tρ : P n+1 → Hom(m−1 ∧ gk, mn) is independent of the connection ρ, for any 0 ≤ i ≤ n − k.
ii) Let i ≤ n + 1. The homogeneous component (tρ)i of degree i of tρ : P n+1 →

Hom(m−1 ∧ m, mn) is independent of the connection ρ.

24

Proof. Consider another connection ρ′ on πn+1 : P n+1 → ¯P (n). From Theorem 12, for any
k=0 gk, gn), such that

H n+1 ∈ P n+1 and a, b ∈ mn, there are A, B ∈ gln+1(mn) + Hom(Pn−1

(59)

tρ′
H n+1(a ∧ b) = tρ

H n+1(a ∧ b) − A(b) + B(a).

Suppose that a ∈ m−1 and b ∈ gk. Then A(b), B(a) ∈ gn and n > −1 + k + i, for any
i ≤ n − k. Relation (59) implies claim i). Let a ∈ m−1 and b ∈ mj. Then degA(b) ≥
n + 1 + j > (−1 + j) + i and degB(a) = n > (−1 + j) + i, for any i ≤ n + 1 (because
j < 0). Relation (59) again implies claim ii).

Deﬁnition 49. i) The vector space Torn+1(mn) := Homn+1(m−1∧m, mn)+Pn−1

gi, gn−1) is called the space of (n + 1)-torsions.

ii) Let ρ be a connection on πn+1 : P n+1 → ¯P (n). The function

H n+1)n−i(a ∧ b), a ∧ b ∈ m−1 ∧ gi

(tρ

is called the (n + 1)-torsion of the Tanaka structure πG.

From Proposition 48, ¯t(n+1) is independent of the choice of ρ.

Theorem 50. For any H n+1 ∈ P n+1 and Id + A ∈ ¯G,

¯t(n+1)
H n+1(Id+A) = ¯t(n+1)

H n+1 + ∂(n+1)(A).

Since a ∈ m−1 and An+1(a) ∈ gn, all arguments of tρ
belong to (m−1 + gn) ∧ mn. From Theorem 43,

H n+1, in the right hand side of (61),

Also, since An+1(a) ∈ gn and An+1(b) ∈ (mn)i+n+1,

tρ
H n+1(An+1(a) ∧ An+1(b)) ∈ (mn)min{n,n+(i+n+1)}.

We project (61) onto (mn)i+n. Using that i+n < min{n, 2n+i+1}, the term tρ
An+1(b)) brings no contribution. We obtain

8 Deﬁnition of ¯π(n+1) : ¯P (n+1) → ¯P (n)

In the setting of the previous section, let W n+1 be a complement of Im(∂(n+1)) in Torn+1(mn).

Proposition 51. i) The natural projection ˜πn+1 : ˜P n+1 = (¯t(n+1))−1(W n+1) ⊂ P n+1 →
¯P (n) is a G-structure, with structure group G = Gn+1GLn+2(mn).

ii) For any connection ˜ρ on ˜πn+1, the torsion function

t˜ρ : ˜P n+1 → Hom(m−1 ∧ (

gi), mn)

nXi=0

has only components of non-negative homogeneous degree and

H n+1)0(a ∧ b) = −[a, b], H n+1 ∈ ˜P n+1, a ∧ b ∈ m−1 ∧ (
(t˜ρ

gi).

nXi=0

Proof. Any An−i ∈ Hom(gi, gn) with ∂(n+1)(An−i) = 0, i.e.

[a, An−i(b)] = −An−i(b)(a) = 0,

∀a ∈ m−1, b ∈ gi,

vanishes identically (because An−i(b) ∈ gn ⊂ Hom(m, mn−1) satisﬁes An−i(b)[x, y] =
[An−i(b)(x), y]+[x, An−i(b)(y)] for any x, y ∈ m, and m−1 generates m; so, if An−i(b)|m−1 =
0, then An−i(b) = 0 and An−i = 0). We proved that ∂(n+1)|Pn−1
i=0 Hom(gi,gn) is injective. For
the same reason, any An+1 ∈ gln+1(mn) which satisﬁes ∂(n+1)(An+1) = 0, i.e.

An+1

n+1([a, b]) = [An+1

n+1(a), b] + [a, An+1

∀a ∈ m−1, b ∈ m,

satisﬁes this relation for any a, b ∈ m. It follows that Ker(cid:0)∂(n+1)|gln+1(mn)(cid:1) = gn+1 +

gln+2(mn). Claim i) follows. Claim ii) follows from Theorem 43 ii).

We can ﬁnally deﬁne ¯P (n+1) and the projection ¯π(n+1) : ¯P (n+1) → ¯P (n). Namely, let

¯P (n+1) := ˜P n+1/GLn+2(mn) and ¯π(n+1) : ¯P (n+1) → ¯P (n) the natural projection.

Theorem 52. The projection ¯π(n+1) : ¯P (n+1) → ¯P (n) satisﬁes the required properties from
Theorem 19 (with n replaced by n + 1).

Proof. Since ˜πn+1 has structure group Gn+1GLn+2(mn), ¯π(n+1) has structure group Gn+1.
The G-structure ˜πn+1 satisﬁes property C from Theorem 19 (see Proposition 51). From
Theorem 6, ¯π(n+1) is isomorphic to a subbundle of the bundle Grn+2(T ¯P (n)) of (n + 2)-
quasi-gradations of T ¯P (n).

9 Proof of Theorem 20

In this section we prove Theorem 20. In Subsection 9.1 we construct the canonical frame
required by Theorem 20. In Subsection 33 we prove the statements about the automor-
phism groups.

27

9.1 The canonical frame on ¯P (¯l).
Proposition 53. Let (Di, πG) be a Tanaka structure of ﬁnite order ¯l. Then the Tanaka
prolongation ¯P (¯l) has a canonical frame F can.

¯l+1 = 0 (at any ¯H s ∈ ¯P (s), ( ¯D(s)

¯l+1) ¯H s is isomorphic to (ms)¯l+1 = g

Consider now a point ¯H ¯l ∈ ¯P (l). We need to construct a canonical frame F can
¯H ¯l

¯l+1 = 0, also gs = 0 for any s ≥ ¯l+1. The ﬁbrations ¯π(s) : ¯P (s) → ¯P (s−1) have
Proof. Since g
structure group Gs; thus, ¯π(s) is a diﬀeomorphism, for any s ≥ ¯l +1. Moreover, for such an
¯l+1 + · · ·+ gs, hence is
s, ¯D(s)
trivial). We obtain that Grm(T ¯P (s)) = Gr(T ¯P (s)) for any s ≥ ¯l + 1 and m ≥ k + ¯l + 1. For
any f, t (with f ≥ t+1) we denote by ¯π(f,t+1) : ¯P (f ) → ¯P (t) the composition ¯π(t+1)◦· · ·◦¯π(f ).
:
m¯l → T ¯H ¯l ¯P (¯l). Let ¯H k+¯l+1 := (¯π(k+¯l+1,¯l+1))−1( ¯H ¯l) ∈ ¯P (k+¯l+1). By our construction of
Tanaka prolongations, ¯P (k+¯l+1) ⊂ Grk+¯l+2(T ¯P (k+¯l)). From the above, Grk+¯l+2(T ¯P (k+¯l)) =
Gr(T ¯P (k+¯l)) and we obtain that ¯P (k+¯l+1) ⊂ Gr(T ¯P (k+¯l)). In particular, ¯H k+¯l+1 deﬁnes a
\¯H k+¯l+1 ◦ I ¯H k+¯l : mk+¯l = m¯l → T ¯H k+¯l ¯P (k+¯l),
gradation of T ¯H k+¯l ¯P (k+¯l) or a frame F ¯H k+¯l+1 =
where ¯H k+¯l = ¯π(k+¯l+1)( ¯H k+¯l+1) and I ¯H k+¯l : m¯l → gr(T ¯H k+¯l ¯P (k+¯l)) is the graded frame from
to be the composition (¯π(k+¯l,¯l+1))∗ ◦
the Tanaka {e}-structure of ¯P (k+¯l). We deﬁne F can
¯H ¯l
F ¯H k+¯l+1 : m¯l → T ¯H ¯l ¯P (¯l).

9.2 The automorphism group Aut(Di, πG)

The proof of the remaining part of Theorem 20 is based on the behaviour of the auto-
morphisms of a Tanaka structure, under the prolongation procedure.

Proposition 54. Let (Di, πG : P = PG → M) be a Tanaka G-structure of type m. The
group of automorphisms Aut(Di, πG) of (Di, πG) is isomorphic to the group of automor-
phisms of the Tanaka {e}-structure on P = PG (see Proposition 21) and to the group of
automorphisms Aut(˜πn) of the G-structures ˜πn : ˜P n → ¯P (n−1), n ≥ 1.

Proof. The argument is similar to the one used in Theorem 3.2 of [9] (in the setting of
prolongations of G-structures) and is based on the naturality of our construction. One ﬁrst
shows that any f ∈ Aut(Di, πG) induces an automorphism fG : P → P of the Tanaka {e}-
structure of P , by fG(u) := f∗ ◦u, for any graded frame u : m → gr(TpM) which belongs to
P , and that f → fG is a bijection betweeen these automorphism groups. Next, one notices
(from deﬁnitions) that the automorphisms of the Tanaka {e}-structure of P coincide with
the automorphisms of the G-structure ˜π1. It remains to prove that Aut(˜πn) is isomorphic
to Aut(˜πn+1), for any n ≥ 1. Any ¯f (n) ∈ Aut(˜πn) induces a map f ˜P n : ˜P n → ˜P n,
deﬁned by f ˜P n(FH n) := ( ¯f (n))∗ ◦ FH n, for any FH n ∈ ˜P n. The map f ˜P n commutes
with the action of GnGLn+1(mn−1) on ˜P n and induces a map ¯f (n+1)
: ¯P (n) → ¯P (n)
which belongs to Aut(˜πn+1) (easy check). For the converse, let ¯f (n) ∈ Aut(˜πn+1), i.e.
¯f (n) : ¯P (n) → ¯P (n) is a diﬀeomorphism, such that, for any frame FH n+1 : mn → T ¯H n ¯P (n)
from ˜P n+1, ( ¯f (n))∗ ◦ FH n+1 : mn → T ¯f (n)( ¯H n)
¯P (n) also belongs to ˜P n+1. Since the frames
from ˜P n+1 are ﬁltration preserving, both FH n+1 and ( ¯f (n))∗ ◦ FH n+1, therefore also ¯f (n),
are ﬁltration preserving. Since the frames from ˜P n+1, restricted to gn, coincide with the
vertical parallelism of ¯π(n) : ¯P (n) → ¯P (n−1), we obtain that ¯f (n)(ξv) ¯P n = (ξv) ¯P (n), for any
v ∈ gn. Therefore, there is ¯f (n−1) : ¯P (n−1) → ¯P (n−1) such that ¯π(n) ◦ ¯f (n) = ¯f (n−1) ◦ ¯π(n).

28

We check that ¯f (n−1) induces ¯f (n). For this, we use

H n+1(x)]( ¯D(n−1)

(66)

for any x ∈ (mn−1)i, where ¯H n = ˜πn+1(H n+1). (Relations (66) follow from FH n+1, ( ¯f (n))∗ ◦
FH n+1 ∈ ˜P n+1 and Lemma 38). Since ¯π(n) ◦ ¯f (n) = ¯f (n−1) ◦ ¯π(n) and ¯f (n), ¯f (n−1) are
ﬁltration preserving, we obtain from relations (66) that F ¯f (n)( ¯H n) = ( ¯f (n−1))∗ ◦ F ¯H n, i.e.
¯f (n) is induced by ¯f (n−1), as required. It is easy to see that ¯f (n−1) ∈ Aut(˜πn).

Remark 55. Recall that the group of automorphisms of a G-structure is isomorphic to
the group of automorphisms of its ﬁrst (or higher order) prolongation, the isomorphism
being given by the natural lift of automorphisms. In the more general setting of Tanaka
structures, the analogue of this statement does not hold: right multiplications in the
principal bundle ¯π(n) are certainly isomorphisms of the Tanaka {e}-structure of ¯P (n), but
are not induced from ¯P (n−1).

Proposition 56. Let (Di, πG : P = PG → M) be a Tanaka structure of ﬁnite order ¯l and
F can the canonical frame of ¯P (¯l). Then Aut(Di, πG) is isomorphic to Aut( ¯P (¯l), F can) and

has the structure of a Lie group, of dimension at most dim(M) +P¯l

Proof. The argument from Proposition 53 provides a canonical frame (an absolute paral-
lelism) (F can)′ on any prolongation ¯P (¯l′) (with ¯l′ ≥ ¯l), isomorphic to F can by means of the
map ¯π(¯l′,¯l+1). Let ¯l′ ≥ ¯l suﬃciently large such that πl′ : P ¯l′ → ¯P (¯l′−1) is an {e}-structure
(recall Deﬁnition 36 for πl′). Then, for any s ≥ ¯l′, P s = ˜P s = ¯P (s) and πs = ˜πs = ¯π(s).
For any ¯H s ∈ ¯P (s) (s ≥ ¯l′), we denote by F ¯H s : m¯l → T¯π(s)( ¯H ¯l)
¯P (s−1) the associated frame.
The ﬁber (πs+1)−1( ¯H s) is the unique frame F(πs+1)−1( ¯H s) : m¯l → T ¯H s ¯P (s), given by

i=0 gi.

(¯π(s))∗ ◦ F(πs+1)−1( ¯H s) = F ¯H s,

s ≥ ¯l′.

Consider now the canonical frame (F can)′ of ¯P (¯l′). It is deﬁned by

(F can)′

¯H ¯l′ = (¯π(k+¯l′,¯l′+1))∗ ◦ F(¯π(k+¯l′+1,¯l′+1))−1( ¯H ¯l′ ).

¯H ¯l′ = F ¯H ¯l′ , for any ¯H ¯l′ ∈ ¯P (¯l′), i.e.
Using (67) and (68), one can check that (¯π(¯l′))∗ ◦ (F can)′
¯H ¯l′ = (π¯l′+1)−1( ¯H ¯l′). We proved that (F can)′ coincides with the absolute parallelism
(F can)′
π¯l′+1 on ¯P (¯l′). Hence Aut( ¯P (¯l′), (F can)′) (or Aut( ¯P (¯l), F can)) is isomorphic to Aut(˜π¯l′+1) =
Aut(π¯l′+1), and also to Aut(Di, πG) (from Proposition 54). From Kobayashi theorem
(see Theorem 3.2 of [4], p. 15) , these groups are Lie groups of dimension at most

dim(M) +P¯l

i=0 gi.
