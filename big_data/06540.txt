ABSTRACT: We have been developing monolithic active pixel
series, named
“XRPIX,” based on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) pixel technology, for future X-ray astronomical
satellites. The XRPIX series offers high coincidence time resolution (∼1 µs), superior readout
time (∼10 µs), and a wide energy range (0.5–40 keV). In the previous study, we successfully
demonstrated X-ray detection by event-driven readout of XRPIX2b. We here report recent
improvements in spectroscopic performance. We successfully increased the gain and reduced the
readout noise in XRPIX2b by decreasing the parasitic capacitance of the sense-node originated in
the buried p-well (BPW). On the other hand, we found signiﬁcant tail structures in the spectral
response due to the loss of the charge collection efﬁciency when a small BPW is employed. Thus,
we increased the gain in XRPIX3b by introducing in-pixel charge sensitive ampliﬁers instead of
having even smaller BPW. We ﬁnally achieved the readout noise of 35 e− (rms) and the energy
resolution of 320 eV (FWHM) at 6 keV without signiﬁcant loss of the charge collection efﬁciency.

Charge-coupled devices (CCDs) [1]-[3] are the standard imaging spectrometers in current X-ray
astronomical satellites. They offer Fano-limited spectroscopic performance with a low readout
noise of about three electrons (rms) and superior imaging performance with the sensor size of 20–
30 mm and a pixel size of ∼24 µm. However, X-ray CCDs have some limitations. The most
signiﬁcant issue is the high non-X-ray background (NXB) above 10 keV generated by the cosmic
rays in orbit.

The NXB can be signiﬁcantly reduced by introducing an anti-coincidence method between hit
signals and external active shield detectors [4]-[6]. This technique requires an X-ray sensor with
a high coincidence time resolution (i.e., ∼1 µs) and short readout time (i.e., ∼10 µs). Thus, we
started developing a new type of active pixel sensors, named XRPIX (X-Ray PIXel). The XRPIX
series is one of the “SOIPIX” family, which is a active pixel sensor based on a semiconductor
pixel detector realized in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
(CMOS) pixel technology led by the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) [7].
Figure 1 shows the cross-sectional view of SOIPIX. The SOI wafer composed of two bonded silicon
wafers with a thin oxide ﬁlm (BOX: buried oxide) in between. The pixel detector consists of a
circuit built within the low-resistivity silicon and a sensing volume realized in the high-resistivity
silicon. The SOIPIX utilizes the thick handle wafer of the SOI structure as a sensing volume to
detect X-rays. We have processed four prototype productions of XRPIX1, XRPIX1b, XRPIX2
and XRPIX2b, and reported the results with them [8]-[12]. In our previous study, we successfully
demonstrated the X-ray detection by the event-driven readout [13][14]. Here, we report recent
improvements in spectroscopic performance in this paper.

The three major factors determining the spectral performance are readout noise, charge col-
lection, and dark current. The noise due to the dark current is simply suppressed by cooling. The
charge collection related issues of XRPIX are studied in [12][15].
In this paper, we focus on
reduction of readout noise mainly limited by in-pixel and on-chip readout circuits. We investigate
a relation between gain and readout noise. Then, we describe a new prototype, “XRPIX3b,” which
has a charge-sensitive ampliﬁer (CSA) circuit in each pixel in order to increase the conversion gain
and reduce readout noise. We also provide some details of the next design challenge from the
information obtained.

2. Reduction of Readout Noise by Small BPW

The chip output gain and the readout noise of XRPIX1, the ﬁrst prototype of the XRPIX series,
were 3.6 µV/e− and 129 e− (rms) [8], where the chip output gain and the readout noise are
deﬁned as the conversion gain from signal charge to output voltage at the output of the chip
(Figure 2) and the width of pedestal peak, respectively. We found the parasitic capacitance of the
sense-node is dominated by the capacitive coupling between a transistor layer and a buried p-well

(BPW) [10][11]. The BPW is the p-type dopant region in the sensor layer under the BOX layer (see
Figure 1), which is one of the key technology of SOIPIX and is introduced as an electrical shield
to suppress the back-gate effect [7]. In XRPIX1b following XRPIX1, we decrease the area of the
BPW to 14 µm square and obtained higher chip output gain of 6.2 µV/e− and better readout noise
of 70 e− (rms) [13].

In order to further increase the gain, we developed the XRPIX2b, which is the forth prototype
of the XRPIX series (Figure 6). The detailed description is found in [14] and its pixel circuit is
shown in Figure 2. XRPIX2b has four kinds of test element groups (TEGs) with the same pixel
circuit layout but with different BPW sizes (Table 1). We obtained spectra of X-rays from an 241Am
radioisotope with the four TEGs in the frame readout mode, in which we read out analog signals
from all pixels serially. After the data reduction and analyses, the details of which are found in [8],
we obtained chip output gains and readout noises given in Table 1. The examples of the spectra
(TEG–A and –C) is shown in Figure 3.

We successfully increased the chip output gain and made further reduction of the readout noise
by decreasing the area of the BPW. Figure 4 shows the relationship between the BPW area and the
gain, which is ﬁtted with a power-law function. We plot the readout noise as a function of the
chip output gain for the TEGs in XRPIX2b, XRPIX1 and XRPIX1b in Figure 5 and found the
correlation can be ﬁtted with a power-law function whose power is ∼ −1.

Although we succeeded in the reduction of the readout noise by increasing the conversion

gain as shown above, we encountered a new problem. As is shown in Figure 3, the X-ray spectral
response of a single line has a signiﬁcant tail structure especially in TEG–B and –C. The fraction
of the tail component to the gaussian increases as the size of BPW decreases from TEG–A to –C.
Through the previous studies on the tail structures by [11][12][15], we consider that it is due to the
loss of the signal charge in the sensor layer. The BPW works also as a part of the sense node as
well as an electrical shield since the BPW is electrically connected to the sense node. Thus, too
small size of the BPW is unable to collects all the signal charge generated and degrades the charge
collection efﬁciency (CCE) and spectral performance. This result suggests that there is a limit to
the method of increasing the gain by reducing the area of the BPW in order to improve spectral
performance.

3. Improvement of Spectral Performance by CSA

We introduced in-pixel CSAs in XRPIX3b, the sixth prototype of an XRPIX series, to raise the
chip output gain by increasing the preceding-stage output gain keeping an appropriate area of the
BPW. In this section, we describe the device speciﬁcation and spectral performance of XRPIX3b.

3.1 Device Description

XRPIX3b was fabricated using the 0.2 µm fully depleted SOI CMOS pixel process by Lapis
Semiconductor Co., Ltd., the same process as XRPIX2b. The detector is 2.9 mm × 2.9 mm in
size and consists of 32 × 32 pixels. The pixel size and the imaging area are 30 µm × 30 µm
and approximately 1.0 mm × 1.0 mm, respectively. Based on the lesson learned, described in the

Figure 8. Pixel circuit of XRPIX3b. The basic component of the pixel circuit is same as the previous
devices. XRPIX3b has CSA circuit newly. The feedback capacitor used in the CSA circuit is 1 fF.

Section 2, we adopted the BPW size of 14 µm in order to keep enough CCE. Herein, we show a
result of the n-type Czochralski-SOI wafer device with a thickness of 310 µm.

The sensor format and block diagram are shown in Figure 7. The chip contains two different
types of TEG pixels. One of the two, “CSA TEG,” has in-pixel CSAs while the other, “SF TEG”
has same pixel circuit but with SFs instead of CSAs, which are shown in the right and left sides of
the device shown in Figure 7. Figure 8 shows the preceding-stage circuits used in the two TEGs
where the feedback capacitance of 1 fF is used in the in-pixel CSA of the CSA TEG.

3.2 Spectral Performance

Figure 9 shows plots of X-ray energy calibrations of XRPIX3b using 5.9, 6.4, 9.71, 11.44, 13.95,
17.74, and 20.77 keV X-ray lines from a 55Fe and an 241Am. The SF and CSA TEGs have the chip
output gains of 5.4 µV/e− and 17.8 µV/e−, respectively. The CSA TEG has the chip output gain
3.3 times higher than the SF TEG.

Figure 10 shows the 55Fe X-ray spectra of single pixel events obtained with the two TEGs
after the data reduction and analyses given in [8]. No signiﬁcant tail structures are seen in the
spectra. The energy resolutions of the SF and CSA TEGs are 730 eV (12.4%) and 320 eV (5.4%)
in FWHM at 5.9 keV, respectively. The readout noises of the SF and CSA TEGs are 82 and 35 e−
(rms), respectively. We successfully improved the X-ray spectral performance by introducing the
in-pixel CSA circuit without degradation of the CCE and resolved Mn-Kα and -Kβ lines for the
ﬁrst time in the XRPIX series.

4. Discussion and Future Prospects

Plotting the readout noise and chip output gain of the CSA TEG of XRPIX3b in Figure 5, we found
it follows the correlation between those of XRPIX1, 1b and the TEGs of XRPIX2b in spite that
the preceding stage output gains are different. All the devices including XRPIX3b are equipped
with the same readout circuits. This implies that almost all the readout noise is attributed not to
the preceding stage but to the readout circuit. Thus, improving the readout circuit is signiﬁcantly
effective to reduce the readout noise. Increasing the preceding stage output gain is also effective.

In this paper, we investigated the adoption of small BPW and in-pixel CSAs in order to
improve the spectral performance of XRPIX. We found that the reduction of the size of the BPW
surly increases the gain. However, there is a limit to it because too small BPW degrades the
CCE. We consider the BPW size of ∼14 µm is optimal for the pixel size of 30 µm. The in-pixel
CSA also increases the preceding stage output gain and reduces the readout noise successfully.
While the CSA with the feedback capacitance of 1 fF is expected to have the chip output gain of

It suggests that there would
be a room to optimize a parameter of the CSA. In the following prototype devices, we will make
further improvement of the spectral performance according to the guideline obtained in this paper.
