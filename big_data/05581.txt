Abstract—This paper presents a novel norm-one-
regularized, consensus-based imaging algorithm, based on
the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).
This algorithm is capable of imaging composite dielectric
and metallic targets by using limited amount of data.
The distributed capabilities of
the ADMM accelerates
the convergence of the imaging. Recently, a Compressive
Reﬂector Antenna (CRA) has been proposed as a way
to provide high-sensing-capacity with a minimum cost
and complexity in the hardware architecture. The ADMM
algorithm applied to the imaging capabilities of the Com-
pressive Antenna (CA) outperforms current state of the art
iterative reconstruction algorithms, such as Nesterov-based
methods, in terms of computational cost; and it ultimately
enables the use of a CA in quasi-real-time, compressive
sensing imaging applications.

I. INTRODUCTION

Reducing the cost of electromagnetic sensing and
imaging systems is a necessity before they can be
ubiquitously deployed as a part or a large-scale network
of sensors. Recently, a single transceiver Compressive
Antenna (CA) was proposed as a vehicle to enhance
the sensing capacity of an active imaging system, which
is equivalent
to maximizing the information transfer
efﬁciency from the imaging domain and radar system;
and, as a result, the cost and hardware architecture of
the imaging system can be drastically reduced [1]. This
unique feature of CAs has triggered its use in a wide
variety of applications, which include the following: 1)
active imaging of metallic target at mm-wave frequencies
[1]; passive imaging of the physical temperature of the
earth at mm-wave frequencies [2]; and active imaging of
red blood cells at optical frequencies [3]. CAs rely on
the use of norm-one-regularized iterative Compressive
Sensing imaging techniques (CS), such as NESTA [4],
which are slow and computationally very expensive; and,
ultimately, it may compromise its use in quasi-real-time
imaging applications. In order to overcome these imag-
ing barriers, a new fully-parallelizable, consensus-based
imaging algorithm, based on the Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) formulation is proposed
in this paper.

II. COMPRESSIVE REFLECTOR ANTENNA

A. General Overview

The concept of operation of the CRA for sensing
and imaging applications relies on two basic principles:

Fig. 1. 2D cross-section of a Traditional Reﬂector Antenna (x > 0),
and Compressive Reﬂector Antenna (x < 0).

1) multi-dimensional codiﬁcation, generated by a cus-
tomized reﬂector; and 2) compressing sensing imaging,
performed on the measured data.

The CRA is fabricated, as Fig. 1 shows on the bottom
(x < 0), by introducing discrete scatterers, Ωi, on
the surface of a Traditional Reﬂector Antenna (TRA),
shown on the top (x > 0) of Fig. 1. Each scatterer
Ωi is characterized by the electromagnetic parameters:
conductivity, permeability and permittivity, {σi, µi, i},
and the scatterer size {Dx
i } in {ˆx, ˆy, ˆz}. CRA
and TRA share also many geometrical parameters: D,
aperture size; f, focal length; ho, offset height.

i , Dy

i , Dz

These scatterers generate a spatially coded pattern in
the near and far ﬁeld of the antenna after reﬂecting the
incident ﬁeld produced by the feeding element. When
this coded pattern is changed as a function of time,
CS techniques can be used to generate a 3D image
of an object under test. There are several techniques
that may be used for switching among different spatial
coded patterns generated by the CRA. Some of them
are the following: 1) electronic beam steering by using
a focal plane array; 2) electronic beam steering by an
electronically-reconﬁgurable sub-reﬂector; 3) electronic
change of the constitutive parameters of the scatters; 4)
mechanical rotation of the reﬂector along the axis of the
parabola ˆz; 5) mechanical rotation of a single feeding

horn or array along the axis of the parabola ˆz.

B. Sensing matrix

For the example carried out in this paper, a mechanical
rotation of the reﬂector along the axis of the parabola
is chosen to generate the coded pattern, so just with a
single transceiver the CRA can perform the 3D imaging.
This conﬁguration can be described as a multiple mono-
static one, in which data is collected during the scan
period, ts, where the reﬂector is rotated θr degrees for
r = 1, ..., Nθ along the axis of the parabola. The image
reconstruction, which is placed on a Region Of Interest
(ROI) located zT
0 meters away of the focal point of the
CRA, is performed in Np pixels and the systems uses Nf
frequencies. Under this conﬁguration, the sensing matrix
H ∈ CNt×Np establishes a linear relationship between
the unknown complex vector u ∈ CNp and the measured
complex ﬁeld data g ∈ CNt, with Nt = Nθ·Nf , the total
number of reﬂector rotation angles times the number
of frequencies. This relationship can be expressed in a
matrix form as follows:

g = Hu + w,

(1)
where w ∈ CNt represents the noise collected by the
receiving antenna for a given frequency and rotation
angle.

III. ADMM FORMULATION

Equation (1) can be solved via a novel method
for optimizing convex functions called the Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), [5], [6].
The general representation of an optimization problem
through the ADMM takes the following form:

minimize f (u) + g(v)
s.t.
Pu + Qv = c

(2)

where f and g are convex, closed and proper functions
over the unknown vectors u ∈ Cn and v ∈ Cm, and the
known matrices P ∈ Cp×n and Q ∈ Cp×m and vector
c ∈ Cp are the ones that deﬁne the constraint. As it can
be noticed, the methodology of ADMM introduces a new
variable v in order to be able to update both variables
u and v in an alternating direction fashion. The price
to pay for this is the need to add a new constraint. A
detail description about the ADMM may be found in
the references [5], [7], [8]. In order to solve equation
(1) for the unknown variable u, the convex function
f (u) = (cid:107)Hu − g(cid:107)2
2 is minimized in conjuntion with
the norm 1 regularized g(v) = λ(cid:107)v(cid:107)1; as a result, the
ADMM problem to minimize takes the lasso form and
is formulated as follows:
1

2 (cid:107)Hu − g(cid:107)2

2 + λ(cid:107)v(cid:107)1

minimize

(3)

u − v = 0,

s.t.

where P = I, Q = −I and c = 0 enforces that
the
variables u and v are equal. This problem can be solved
in a distributed fashion, by splitting the original matrix
H and the vector g into N submatrices Hi –by rows–
and N sub-vectors gi, as shown in Fig. 2. Additionally,
it is possible to deﬁne N different variables ui; so that
the equation (3) turns into

ui = v, ∀i = 1, ..., N.

Equation (4) is solved as N different problems. The
variable v works as a consensus variable, imposing the
agreement between all the variables ui. See for example
[9]–[13]. The augmented Lagrangian function for this
problem is of the following form:

where si is the dual variable for each constraint i, and ρ

by using all the independent solutions ui and si. The

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

The performance of

the CRA is evaluated in a
millimeter-wave imaging application. The parameters
used for the numerical simulation are shown in Table
I, as deﬁned in [1]. The total number of measurements
used for the reconstruction is given by the number of
angles times the number of frequencies, which is equal
to 93. The center frequency of the system is 60GHz,
and it has a bandwidth of 6GHz. For this example, each
scatter Ωi is considered as a Perfect Electric Conductor
(PEC), so σi = σP EC and the CRA is discretized into
triangular patches, as described in [17]. These triangles
are characterized by an averaged size of < Dx > and <
Dy > in ˆx and ˆy dimensions, respectively. The scatterer
size Dz
i of each triangle in ˆz is modeled as a uniform
random variable. The parameter λc is the wavelength at
the center frequency. The imaging ROI is located zT
0
away from the focal point of the CRA; and it encloses a
0 ,
volume determined by the following dimensions: ∆xT
0 in ˆx, ˆy and ˆz dimensions. The ROI is
∆yT
discretized into cubes of side length l.
With the paremeters shown in Table I, the sensing
matrix H has a size of 93×25000. The proposed method
divides H into N = 31 submatrices of size 3 × 25000,
which is used for each optimization of ui. As a result of
applying the matrix inversion lemma, only 31 matrices
of dimension 3 × 3 need to be inverted instead of a
large 25000 × 25000 matrix. The inversion of these 31
matrices are performed just once; and they are used
afterwards in each iteration, as indicated in equation (6).
The proposed ADMM algorithm highly accelerates the

optimization process. Figure 3 shows the imaging results
using (a) a traditional pseudo-inverse approach, where
many artifacts appear, (b) NESTA algorithm [4] and (c)
the ADMM method, with a norm-1 weight of λ = 0.01
and a value of ρ = 1, for a structure of 4 targets. Despite
a few artifacts may appear in this process, the regular-
ized ADMM solution clearly outperforms the pseudo-
inverse solution in terms of image quality. Additionally,
the ADMM algorithm solved the problem in just 3s
for 500 iterations, while the NESTA algorithm solved
the problem in 203s, thus showing the efﬁcacy of the
proposed approach. In Fig. 4, the ADMM convergence
process for different values of the parameters λ and ρ is
shown, including the combination used for the example
in this paper. The stability and speed of the convergence
prove that the imaging could be performed in real time.

V. CONCLUSION

This work has presented the mathematical principles
of a new distributed, consensus-based imaging algorithm
using the norm-one-regularized ADMM for a Compres-
sive Reﬂector Antenna. The explanation of the whole
methodology, the graphical comparison between other
techniques and the convergence process have been ex-
plained in this paper. Besides the simplicity of the pro-
posed algorithm, it outperforms both traditional pseudo-
inverse imaging algorithms, in terms of image quality,
and current state of the art
iterative algorithms (i.e.
NESTA), in terms of computational cost.
