THE SPECTRUM OF GEODESIC BALLS ON SPHERICALLY

SYMMETRIC MANIFOLDS

DENIS BORISOV AND PEDRO FREITAS

Abstract. We study the Dirichlet spectrum of the Laplace operator on ge-
odesic balls centred at a pole of spherically symmetric manifolds. We ﬁrst
derive a Hadamard–type formula for the dependence of the ﬁrst eigenvalue λ1
on the radius r of the ball, which allows us to obtain lower and upper bounds
for λ1 in speciﬁc cases. For the sphere and hyperbolic space, these bounds
are asymptotically sharp as r approaches zero and we see that while in two
dimensions λ1 is bounded from above by the ﬁrst two terms in the asymptotics
for small r, for dimensions four and higher the reverse inequality holds.

In the general case we derive the asymptotic expansion of λ1 for small
radius and determine the ﬁrst three terms explicitly. For compact manifolds we
carry out similar calculations as the radius of the geodesic ball approaches the
diameter of the manifold. In the latter case we show that in even dimensions
there will always exist logarithmic terms in these expansions.

1. Introduction

Within the last forty years several papers appeared in the literature devoted to
the study of the ﬁrst eigenvalue of geodesic disks on spherically symmetric mani-
folds, with particular emphasis on the case of spaces of constant curvature – see,
for example, [Ba, BB, BCG, Ca, FH, Ga, Gr, K, M, MT, P1, P2, S, W]. In this
particular instance, namely, hyperbolic space Hn and spheres Sn, the solutions are
known explicitly in terms of Legendre functions of the ﬁrst kind, the eigenvalues
then being given in terms of zeros of such functions. What is thus of interest is
to obtain bounds and approximations which may be written explicitly in terms of
more elementary functions, as in general computer packages may determine these
zeros with the needed accuracy – it should, however, be noted that in limit cases
such as when the radius becomes very large in hyperbolic space these computations
may still pose some diﬃculties from a numerical point of view.

For general spherically symmetric manifolds, however, it will not be possible to
write the eigenvalues of geodesic balls explicitly in terms of known functions, and it
then becomes important to have accurate estimates for these quantities. Apart from
their intrinsic interest, bounds of this type may also be used to estimate eigenvalues
of balls on manifolds which are not necessarily spherically symmetric, by making
use of the recent spectral comparison results established in [FMS].

A major diﬀerence when moving away from the Euclidean framework is that
scaling the domain no longer translates into a mere scaling in spectral terms. More
precisely, while in the former case we have λ(αΩ) = α−2λ(Ω) for a scaling of a

domain Ω by a positive number α and any eigenvalue λ, for the latter the variation
of eigenvalues will provide extra information on the metric.

With the above in mind, it makes thus sense as a ﬁrst step in this direction
to derive a Hadamard–type formula for the variation of the ﬁrst eigenvalue of a
geodesic ball with respect to the radius. This will in turn allow us to derive some
new lower and upper bounds which, apart from improving existing results within
certain ranges of the radius, also have the advantage of being explicit in the sense
mentioned above. As an example of this, Theorem 3.3 gives lower and upper bounds
for disks in hyperbolic space and spheres which agree with the ﬁrst two terms in
the asymptotics of the ﬁrst eigenvalue as the radius approaches zero.

In fact, and as a consequence of these bounds, we see that for (non-Euclidean)
constant curvature spaces, while in two dimensions the ﬁrst eigenvalue is bounded
from above by the ﬁrst two terms in the asymptotics, this relation is reversed for
dimensions greater than or equal to 4 – for H3 and S3 the expressions obtained are
exact.

In the case of a general n−manifold, the ﬁrst two terms in these asymptotic

expansions of the kth eigenvalue λk are known to be given by

λk(r) =

1
r2 γk −

1
6S(p) + o(1),

where γk denotes the kth eigenvalue of the unit disk in n−dimensional Euclidean
space and S(p) denotes the scalar curvature at the point p – see [C, p. 318]. In
the particular case of a spherically symmetric manifold we shall derive the full
asymptotic expansion for the ﬁrst eigenvalue of a disk of small radius r centred at
a pole and, for compact manifolds, also the expansion as this radius approaches
the diameter of the manifold. We then determine the expression for the ﬁrst three
terms explicitly, from which we obtain, for instance, that under certain natural
smoothness assumptions the third term in the expansion above is of order r2 and
the corresponding expansion for λ1 is given by

λ1(r) =

j2

n
2

−1,1

r2 −

1

6S(p) +(cid:2)α1S2(p) + α2S ′′(p)(cid:3) r2 + o(r4),

where α1 and α2 are constants which depend only on the dimension – see Theo-
rem 4.1 below for the details, including explicit expressions for these coeﬃcients.
The expressions for the asymptotics as the radius of the ball approaches the di-
ameter are more involved (in particular, they depend in a nontrivial way on the
dimension) and are presented in Theorem 5.1. Although this situation corresponds
to the well–known singular perturbation problem of a manifold with a small hole
whose volume approaches zero – see [F, C] and [MNP], for instance, and the refer-
ences therein – we shall see that in all even dimensions logarithmic terms do appear
in the expansions for λ1. This comes as a surprise as, to the best of our knowl-
edge, so far only in two dimensions was it known that a logarithmic term would be
present (in fact the leading term), as a direct consequence of the singularity of the
corresponding Green’s function – see also Table II in [F] which contains an overview
of the results for this type of problems.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In the next section we ﬁx the notation and
state some basic facts which will be used in the sequel. Section 3 contains the state-
ment and derivation of the Hadamard-type formula, followed by its application to
obtaining upper and lower bounds in Section 3.1. We then proceed to determine the

THE SPECTRUM OF GEODESIC BALLS ON SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC MANIFOLDS 3

asymptotic expansions mentioned above for small and maximal radius in Sections 4
and 5, respectively.

2. Notation and preliminaries

Given a suﬃciently smooth function f : R+

0 → R+

0 satisfying

(2.1)

f (0) = 0,

f ′(0) = 1,

f ′′(0) = 0,

and f (r) > 0 for all r in (0, R) for some positive R (possibly inﬁnite), let M be the
spherically symmetric n−manifold with metric dr2 + f 2(r)dθ2 and p be the point
at the North pole. The above restriction on the second derivative of f stems from
the fact that the scalar curvature S at a point p is given by [Pe, p. 69]

(2.2)

S(p) = −2(n − 1)

f ′′(t)
f (t)

+ (n − 1)(n − 2)

1 − [f ′(t)]2

f 2(t)

and it thus follows that for this to be ﬁnite at t = 0 one must have f ′′(0) = 0. It
turns out that for the metric to be regular at t equal to zero stronger restrictions
have to be imposed on f . In particular, if it is to be smooth, then all even derivatives
of f must vanish at zero [Pe, pp. 12–13]. Throughout the paper we shall make this
assumption, although it is clear that if f (2k)(0) is not zero for some k larger than
one then the terms appearing in the asymptotics in Section 4 should be modiﬁed
accordingly.

We consider the geodesic ball B(r) centred at p and with radius r. The n−volume

of this ball is then given by

V (r) = ωn−1

rZ0

f n−1(t)dt,

while the (n − 1)−volume of its boundary is given by
S(r) = ωn−1f n−1(r),

where ωn−1 denotes the (n − 1)−volume of the unit sphere Sn−1.
In this setting, the ﬁrst eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on B(r)
with Dirichlet boundary conditions is simple and the corresponding eigenfunction
does not change sign and is also spherically symmetric. Denoting this eigenvalue
by λ = λ(r) and by ψ a corresponding eigenfunction, we have that the pair (λ, ψ)
satisﬁes

(2.3)

( −(cid:2)f n−1(t)ψ′(t)(cid:3)′

ψ′(0) = ψ(r) = 0.

= λf n−1(t)ψ(t),

t ∈ (0, r)

We can also interpret λ and ψ as the ﬁrst eigenvalue and the associated eigen-
function of the operator Hr, where Hr is introduced as the self-adjoint operator in
X 0
r associated with the closed lower-semibounded quadratic form hr[u] := ku′k2
on Xr. Here

3. A Hadamard-type formula for the first eigenvalue

While in the Euclidean case the ﬁrst eigenvalue of balls centred at any point and
with diﬀerent radii are related to each other by a simple rescaling, this will not be
the case in more general ambient spaces. As a consequence, the way in which the
eigenvalue varies as a function of the radius of the ball will contain information
about the ambient space. The purpose of this section is to establish a formula for
such a variation in the more general situation of a spherically symmetric manifold
with the centre of the ball placed at the North pole.

Lemma 3.1. Let ψ be a solution of equation (2.3) associated to the ﬁrst eigenvalue
λ(r). Then, for any non–negative r0,

λ(r) =

3.1. Applications of Lemma 3.1 to hyperbolic space and spheres. As in
the classical Hadamard formula for the variation of the ﬁrst eigenvalue with respect
to domain variations, the expressions in Lemma 3.1 depend on the eigenfuntion of
the unperturbed domain. Although this may make it slightly diﬃcult to use in
general, there are situations for which, depending on the behaviour of the function
H, it might be possible to derive simpliﬁed expressions for these formulae. The
case of spaces of constant curvature is one such example as we shall now see.

where s denotes sinh or sin, respectively, and in all indicated ± the plus and minus
signs are to be considered for Hn and Sn, respectively.
Remark 3.4. In the case of the upper bounds in Hn (n > 3), they approach (n−1)2/4
as r goes to inﬁnity and are thus also asymptotically accurate in this limit. The
bounds for Sn are not asymptotically accurate as r approaches π (except for n = 3),
and indeed they may become quite poor in this limit.

Remark 3.5. Note also that the above bounds are similar to those in Theorem 5.2
in [Ga]. However, the latter do not display the correct asymptotic behaviour as r
goes to zero.

Proof. In the case of hyperbolic space with constant curvature −1, f (t) = sinh(t),
and the function H(t) = th′(t) + 2h(t) becomes

H(t) = (n − 1) coth2(t) −

1

sinh2(t)

[2 + (n − 3)t coth(t)] .

Its derivative may be written as
n − 3
2 sinh4(t)

H ′(t) =

[2t(2 + cosh(2t)) − 3 sinh(2t)] ,

from which it follows that, for positive t, H is decreasing for n equal to two, identi-
cally equal to 2 for n equal to three, and increasing for n larger than three. Using
these monotonicity properties in Lemma 3.1, together with

and lim
t→∞
yields the bounds for Hn given in Theorem 3.3.

while

H ′(t) =

n − 3
2 sin4(t)

[2t(2 + cos(2t)) − 3 sin(2t)] .

We again obtain that, for 0 < t < π, H is decreasing when n is two, constant
(−2) for n equal to three and increasing for n larger than 3. This, together with
Lemma 3.1, yields the bounds for Sn given in Theorem 3.3.

4. Asymptotic expansion for small radius

In this section we consider the case of a small geodesic disk centred at the North
Pole in the case where its radius approaches zero. We assume f to be suﬃciently
smooth for small r, and our aim is to obtain the asymptotic expansion for λ(r) and
the associated eigenfunction ψ.

Our main result here is the following.

Remark 4.2. The integrals Ik (k = 2, 3) above are, in general, not computable in
terms of known constants. However, in dimension three it is possible to carry out
all the computations explicitly to obtain that α1 vanishes in that case and thus

Remark 4.3. Although the above theorem provides only three terms in the asymp-
totics for the eigenvalue, our technique allows us to construct the complete asymp-
totic expansion, cf. equations (4.4), (4.5), (4.6), (4.7), (4.11), (4.12) below. And in
the theorem we calculate explicitly in a convenient form only ﬁrst three terms just
to demonstrate the result.

In order to handle the situation where r → 0+, it is natural to introduce a

rescaled variable ξ := tr−1 and to rewrite the eigenvalue problem (2.1) as

where the function f0(t) is bounded uniformly in [0, r0]. We substitute the last

with the boundary conditions (4.2). More precisely, operator H∗ is understood as
the associated one with the quadratic form h0[u] := ku′k2
Y0 on Y1. By D(H∗) we
denote the domain of operator H∗.
Lemma 4.4. For each u ∈ D(H∗) the estimate

holds true, where the constant C is independent of u.

Proof. The statement of the lemma follows easily from the two estimates

kf0(r ·)u′kY0 6 C(cid:0)kH∗ukY0 + kukY0(cid:1)
2(cid:0)kH∗uk2

Y0 + kuk2

and

h0[u] = (H∗u, u)Y0 6 1
valid for each u ∈ D(H∗).

kf0(r ·)u′kY0 6 Ch0[u],

(cid:3)

The last lemma implies that the operator (n − 1)f0(rξ) d

dξ is H∗-bounded with
the bounds independent of r. Hence, we can consider problem (4.3), (4.2) as a small
perturbation of the eigenvalue problem for H∗. Therefore, eigenvalue λ(r) and the
associated eigenfunction can be represented as the convergent series

(4.4)

λ(r) = r−2

where the latter converges in Y1. We substitute these series into (4.3) and (4.2) to
obtain the following equations for ψj,

(H∗ − λ0)ψj = λjψ0 +

λkψj−k + (n− 1)f0(r ·)ψ′

λ1 = −(n − 1)(f0(r ·)ψ′

0, ψ0)Y0 .

The solution to (4.8) exists and is deﬁned up to an additive term Cu0, which may
be determined by the orthogonality condition

(4.10)

(ψ1, ψ0)Y0 = 0.

In the same way we solve the succesion of the problems for ψj, j > 2. The corre-
sponding equations (4.5) for ψj are solvable, if their right–hand sides are orthogonal
to ψ0 in Y0. These solvability conditions then yield the formulae for λj,

(4.11)

λj = −(n − 1)(f0(r ·)ψ′

j−1, ψ0)Y0 .

Here we have used that all the functions ψj are deﬁned modulo an additive term
of the form Cψ0, which are determined as above from the orthogonality conditions

(4.12)

(ψj, ψ0)Y0 = 0.

In this way all the coeﬃcients of series (4.5) are uniquely determined. One can
also check by induction that these coeﬃcients are bounded uniformly in r (the
coeﬃcients ψj in Y1-norm).

The coeﬃcients of series (4.4) depend on r through the coeﬃcient f0(rξ) in (4.3).
On the other hand, if the function f is smooth enough, we can simplify the asymp-
totic expansion. More precisely, we can replace f0(rξ) by its Taylor formula as
r → 0+ and substitute it into (4.5), (4.8), (4.9), (4.10), (4.11) and (4.12), leading
to another asymptotic expansion in terms of powers of r. We employ this fact
to construct leading terms of the asymptotics in a more explicit form than (4.4).
Namely, we assume f ∈ C5[0, r0] and f (2)(0) = 0 with, as mentioned in Section 2,
the latter identity reﬂecting the smoothness of the manifold at the pole. Hence

¿From the expression for the scalar curvature at a point p given by (2.2) we
obtain that at the North Pole (t = 0) this becomes S(p) = −n(n − 1)f (3)(0), while
S ′(p) = 0 and

S ′′(p) =

(n + 2)(n − 1)

6

(cid:20)(cid:16)f (3)(0)(cid:17)2

− f (5)(0)(cid:21) .

Solving this for f (3) and f (5) and substituting above yields the expressions for α1
and α2 in Theorem 4.1.

5. Asymptotic expansion for maximal radius

In this section we consider the case of a compact manifold with the function f

satisfying

(5.1)

f (R) = 0,

f ′(R) = A < 0,

f ′′(R) = 0.

In contrast to the previous section, here we treat the case of the disk being close
to the whole manifold, namely, r → R−. Note that since the disk is centred at the
North pole, we have that the maximal radius R equals the diameter of the manifold.
Our aim is to construct the asymptotic expansion for λ(r) as r → R−. And the

main result reads as follows.

p and with radius r satisﬁes as r → R−

Remark 5.2. The ﬁrst term in the asymptotics in the case of domains with a small
hole was investigated by many authors – see [F] and the references therein, and
also [C] and [MNP], for instance; the latter of these includes the full expansion in
the case of a two-dimensional manifold with a small hole. With our approach we are
able to obtain the complete asymptotic expansions in any dimension, cf. identities
(5.8) below. As we see, for dimensions 2, 4 and 6 logarithmic terms appear in these
expansions. While for n = 2 this is quite natural as these terms are produced
directly by the singularity of the Green function for such two-dimensional elliptic
operators, for other dimensions their appearance is not so evident and, to our
knowledge, was not known before. Moreover, provided f is smooth enough, say, f
is inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable, it can be shown that the complete asymptotic expansion
for λ(r) involves logarithmic terms in all even dimensions, see Remark 5.6.

DENIS BORISOV AND PEDRO FREITAS

First we construct the asymptotics formally and then we rigorously estimate the
error terms. Since for r = R the lowest eigenvalue of Laplace-Beltrami operator
on the manifold is 0 and the associated eigenfunction is constant, we could assume
that the leading term in the asymptotic expansion for ψ(t, r) should be constant.
On the other hand, the constant function does not satisfy the boundary condition
on t = r in (2.3). The usual way to achieve the desired boundary condition is to
employ the boundary layer method [VL] or the matching of asymptotic expansion
[I]. Here we do not go in this way since it is possible to include the inner expansion
into the external one and to construct the full asymptotics as a series in terms of
the variable t without introducing the rescaled variable. In order to do it, we have
to take the leading term in the expansion for ψ in a special form. Namely, we
assume the following ans¨atzes,

(5.8)

λ(r) =

µj

n(r)λj (r), ψ(t, r) =

∞Xj=1
µn(r) :=( ln−1(R − r),

n = 2,
(2 − n)(r − R)n−2, n > 3.

∞Xj=0

µj

n(r)ψj (t, r),

where λj and ψj are to be determined. We deﬁne the function ψ0 as the solution
to the boundary value problem

(−(f n−1ψ′

in (0, r),

0(0, r) = 0, ψ0(0, r) = 1,

has the unique solution given by the formula

It belongs to C2[0, r] and satisﬁes the uniform in r estimate

Proof. It is clear that the function u deﬁned by (5.15) solves (5.14) and belongs to
C2[0, R]. Let us prove estimate (5.16). Due to (5.13) we have

we arrive at (5.16).

(cid:3)

We employ the last lemma to solve the problems (5.12). In order for the series
(5.8) to be asymptotic the coeﬃcients λj and ψj should be bounded uniformly in
r. Hence, to have the function ψ1 bounded, the right hand side of the equation for
ψ1 should satisfy (5.13). It implies the formula for λ1,

We shall now compute the denominator in the last formula. To this end, integrate

Together with the deﬁnition of λ0 in (5.9), this allows us to rewrite the formula for
λ1,

Again by (5.10) we see that

λ1(r) =

λ1(r) =

Since condition (5.13) is satisﬁed, the solution to the equation for ψ1 in (5.12) is

given by the identity

and this function is bounded uniformly in r,

ψ1 = L[λ1f n−1ψ0 − λ0f n−1] ∈ C2[0, R]

In the same way we solve problems (5.12) for j > 2. We ﬁrst write condition

(5.13) that determines λj,

where we have used (5.17). Provided the functions ψk and λk, k > j − 1, are
bounded uniformly in r (the former in the C1[0, R]-norm), by (5.10) we obtain that
λj is also bounded uniformly in r. Then, by Lemma 5.3, the function ψj reads as
follows,

(5.20)

ψj = L(cid:2)λj ψ0 +

j−1Xk=1

λkψj−k(cid:3).

It belongs to C2[0, R] and is bounded uniformly in r in the C1[0, R]-norm.

In conclusion to the formal constructing we prove that series (5.8) are formal

asymptotic solutions to (2.3). For N > 0 we let

(cid:3)

We proceed to the justiﬁcation of the asymptotics. We ﬁrst prove two auxiliary

lemmas characterizing λ(r).

Lemma 5.5. The eigenvalue λ(r) is the only one of the problem (2.3) which con-
verges to zero as ε → 0+. It is simple and satisﬁes the estimate

satisfy (5.29). At the same time, it contradicts to the fact that these eigenfunctions

Remark 5.6. Provided f is smooth enough and all its even derivatives vanish at
R, we can write the next terms in expansion (5.35). They will be of order O((t −
R)−n+2k+1), k > 0, and for even dimensions we obtain a term of order O((t−R)−1).
After integration, this will produce the logarithmic term in the expansion for G(r)
as r → R−, giving rise to such terms appearing in the expansion for λ(r).

Suppose n > 6. Then by (5.8)

(5.36)

λ(r) = µn(r)λ1(ρ) + O(cid:0)(R − r)2n−4(cid:1),

r → R−.

Let us identify the asymptotic behavior of λ1(r) as r → R−. We ﬁrst employ (5.17)

In order to calculate similar three-terms asymptotics for λ(r) for low dimensions
n = 2, 3, 4, 5 we cannot neglect higher terms of asymptotics (5.8) as in (5.36). The
reason is that higher terms also contribute to the desired asymptotics.
In what
follows we consider separately each dimension.

Consider ﬁrst the case n = 5. We take ﬁrst two terms in (5.8),

(5.37)

λ(r) = µ5(r)λ1(r) + µ2

5(r)λ2(r) + O(cid:0)(R − r)9(cid:1),

(5.41) λ(r) = µ3(r)λ1(r) + µ2

It remains to consider the case n = 2. As in (5.41), we take ﬁrst three terms in

(5.8),
(5.45) λ(r) = µ2(r)λ1(r) + µ2
It follows from (5.35), (5.17) that
