ON HOMOLOGY OF COMPLEMENTS OF COMPACT

SETS IN HILBERT CUBE

ASHWINI AMARASINGHE AND ALEXANDER DRANISHNIKOV1

Abstract. We introduce the notion of spaces with weak relative
cohomology and show the acyclicity of the complement Q\X in the
Hilbert cube Q of a compactum X with weak relative cohomology.
As a corollary we obtain the acyclicity of the complement results
when

(a) X is weakly inﬁnite dimensional;
(b) X has ﬁnite cohomological dimension.

1. Introduction

This paper was motivated in part by a recent results of Belegradek
and Hu [BH] about connectedness properties of the space Rk
≥0(R2) of
non-negative curvature metrics on R2 where k stands for C k topology.
In particular, they proved that the complement Rk
≥0(R2) \ X is con-
nected for every ﬁnite dimensional X. In [A] this result was extended
to weakly inﬁnite dimensional spaces X. The main topological idea of
these results is that a weakly inﬁnite dimensional compact set cannot
separate the Hilbert cube.

A. AMARASINGHE AND A. DRANISHNIKOV

Banakh and Zarichnyi posted in [P] a problem (Problem Q1053)
whether the complement Q \ X to a weakly inﬁnite dimensional com-
pactum X in the Hilbert cube Q is acyclic. They were motivated by the
facts that Q \ X is acyclic in the case when X is ﬁnite dimensional [K]
and when it is countably dimensional (see [BCK]). It turns out that
the problem was already answered aﬃrmatively by Garity and Wright
in the 80s [GW]. It follows from Theorem 4.5 [GW] which states that
ﬁnite codimension closed subsets of the Hilbert cube are strongly inﬁ-
nite dimensional. In this paper we found some suﬃcient cohomological
conditions on compact metric spaces for the acyclicity of the comple-
ment in the Hilbert cube which give an alternative solution for the
Banakh-Zarichnyi problem.

We introduced a cohomological version of the concept of strongly in-
ﬁnite dimensional spaces. We call a spaces which is not cohomologically
strongly inﬁnite dimensional as spaces with weak relative cohomology.
The main result of the paper is an acyclicity statement for the comple-
ment of compacta with weak relative cohomology in the Hilbert cube.

2. Main Theorem

2.1. Alexander Duality. We recall that for a compact set X ⊂ Sn
there is a natural isomorphism ADn : H n−k−1(X) → Hk(Sn \ X) called
the Alexander duality. The naturality means that for a closed subset
Y ⊂ X there is a commutative diagram (1):

H n−k−1(X) ADn−−−→ ˜Hk(Sn \ X)

y

y

H n−k−1(Y ) ADn−−−→ ˜Hk(Sn \ Y ).

Here we use the singular homology groups and the ˇCech cohomology
groups. We note the Alexander Duality commutes with the suspension
isomorphism s in the diagram (2):

H n−k−1(X)

ADn−−−→ ˜Hk(Sn \ X)

sy

H n−k(ΣX)

∼=y

ADn+1−−−−→ ˜Hk(Sn+1 \ ΣX).

This the diagram can be viewed as a special case of the Spanier-
Whitehead duality [W].

Since Bn/∂Bn = Sn, the Alexander Duality in the n-sphere Sn and
its property can be restated verbatim for the n-ball Bn for subspaces

ON HOMOLOGY OF THE COMPLEMENTS

X ⊂ Bn with X ∩ ∂Bn 6= ∅ in terms of relative cohomology groups

H n−k−1(X, X ∩ ∂Bn) AD−→ Hk(Int Bn \ X).

Note that for a pointed space X the reduced suspension ΣX is the
quotient space (X×I)/(X×∂I∪x0×I) and the suspension isomorphism
s : H i(X, x0) → H i+1(ΣX) = H i+1(X ×I, X ×∂I ∪x0 ×I) is deﬁned by
a cross product with the fundamental class φ ∈ H 1(I, ∂I), s(α) = α×φ.
Note that α × φ = α∗ ∪ φ∗ in H i+1(X × I, X × ∂I ∪ x0 × I) where α∗ ∈
H i(X×I, x0×I) is the image of α under the induced homomorphism for
the projection X ×I → X and φ∗ ∈ H 1(X ×I, X ×∂I) is the image of φ
under the induced homomorphism deﬁned by the projection X ×I → I.
Thus in view of an isomorphism H∗(Int Bn \ X) → H∗(Bn \ X), the
commutative diagram (2) stated for Bn turns into the following (2′)

H n−k−1(X, ∂X)

ADn−−−→

˜Hk(Bn \ X)

−∪φ∗y

H n−k(X × I, ∂X × I ∪ X × ∂I)

∼=y

ADn+1−−−−→ ˜Hk(Bn+1 \ (X × I))

where ∂X = X ∩ ∂I n.

2.2. Strongly inﬁnite dimensional spaces. First, we recall some
classical deﬁnitions which are due to Alexandroﬀ [AP]. A map f :
X → I n to the n-dimensional cube is called essential if it cannot be
deformed to ∂I n through the maps of pairs (I n, f −1(∂I n)) → (I n, ∂I n).
A map f : X → Q = Q∞
i=1 I to the Hilbert cube is called essential
if the composition pn ◦ f : X → I n is essential for every projection
pn : Q → I n onto the factor. A compact space X is called strongly
inﬁnite dimensional if it admits an essential map onto the Hilbert cube.
An inﬁnite dimensional space which is not strongly inﬁnite dimensional
is called weakly inﬁnite dimensional.

We call a relative cohomology class α ∈ H k(X, A) pure relative if
j ∗(α) = 0 for the inclusion of pairs homomorphism j ∗ : H k(X, A) →
H k(X). This means that α = δ(β) for β ∈ ˜H k−1(A).
In the case
when k = 1 the cohomology class β can be represented by a map
f ′ : A → S 0 = ∂I. Let f : X → I be a continuous extension of f ′.
Then α = f ∗(φ) for the map f : (X, A) → (I, ∂I) of pairs where φ is
the fundamental class.

2.2.1. Proposition. Suppose that for a compact metric space X there a
sequence of pure relative classes αi ∈ H 1(X, Ai), i = 1, 2, . . . , Ai ⊂Cl X
such that the cup-product α1 ∪ αn ∪ · · · ∪ αn 6= 0 for all n. Then X is
strongly inﬁnite dimensional.

A. AMARASINGHE AND A. DRANISHNIKOV

Proof. Let fi : (X, Ai) → (I, ∂I) be representing αi maps. Note that
the homomorphism f ∗
i=1Ai) induced by the
map ¯fn = (f1, f2, . . . , fn) : X → I n takes the product of the funda-
mental classes φ1 ∪ · · · ∪ φn to α1 ∪ αn ∪ · · · ∪ αn 6= 0. Therefore, fn is
essential. Thus, the map

n : H n(I n, ∂I n) → H n(X, ∪n

f = (f1, f2, . . . ) : X →

∞

Y

i=1

I = Q

is essential.

(cid:3)

We call a space X cohomologically strongly inﬁnite dimensional if
there is a sequence of pure relative classes αi ∈ H ki(X, Ai), ki > 0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , Ai ⊂Cl X such that the cup-product α1 ∪ αn ∪ · · · ∪ αn 6= 0
for all n. Compacta which are not cohomologically strongly inﬁnite
dimensional will be called as compacta with weak relative cohomology
or relative cohomology weak compacta. One can take any coeﬃcient
ring R to deﬁne relative cohomology weak compacta with respect to
R.

Thus, the class of cohomologically weak compacta contains weakly
inﬁnite dimensional compacta (Proposition 3.0.6) as well as all com-
pacta with ﬁnite cohomological dimension.

2.3. Proof of the main theorem.

2.3.1. Proposition. Let X ⊂ Q be a closed subset and let a ∈ Hi(Q\X)
be a nonzero element for some i. Then there exists an n ∈ N such that
the image an of a under the inclusion homomorphism

Hi(Q \ X) → Hi(Q \ p−1

n pn(X))

is nontrivial.

Proof. This follows from the fact that

Hi(Q \ X) = lim
→

Hi(Q \ p−1

n pn(X)).

2.3.2. Theorem. Let X ⊂ Q be a compact subset of the Hilbert cube
with weak relative cohomology with coeﬃcients in a ring with unit R.
Then ˜Hi(Q \ X; R) = 0 for all i.

Proof. We assume everywhere below that the coeﬃcients are taken in
R.

(cid:3)

We note that Q \ p−1

n pn(X) = (I n \ pn(X)) × Qn where Qn is the

Hilbert cube complementary to I n in Q = I n × Qn.

ON HOMOLOGY OF THE COMPLEMENTS

Assume the contrary, ˜Hi(Q\X) 6= 0. Let a ∈ ˜Hi(Q\X) be a nonzero
element. We use the notation Xk = pk(X). By Proposition 2.3.1 there
is n such that ak 6= 0, ak ∈ ˜Hi((I k \ Xk) × Qk) for all k ≥ n. Thus, we
may assume that ak lives in ˜Hi((I k \ Xk) × {0}) ∼= ˜Hi((I k \ Xk) × Qk).
Let βk ∈ H k−i−1(Xk, Xk ∩ ∂I k) be dual to ak for the Alexander
duality applied in (I k, ∂I k). By the suspension isomorphism for the
Alexander duality (see diagram (2′)), ak is dual in I k+1 to β ∗
k ∪ φ∗
where β ∗
k is the image of βk under the homomorphism induced by the
projection Xk × I → Xk and φ∗ is the image of the fundamental class
φ ∈ H 1(I, ∂I) under the homomorphism induced by the projection
Xk × I → I.

By the naturality of the Alexander duality (we use the Bn-version
of the diagram (1)) applied to the inclusion Xk+1 ⊂ Xk × I we obtain
that ak+1 is dual to β ′
k to Xk+1
and φk+1 is the restriction of φ∗ to Xk+1. Note that β ′
)∗(βk)
where qk+1
: I k+1 → I k restricted
to Xk+1. Thus, βk+1 = (qk+1

: Xk+1 → Xk is the projection pk+1

k+1 is the restriction of β ∗

k ∪φk+1 where β ′

We deﬁne a sequence αj = (qn+j)∗(φn+j) of relative cohomology

the ˇCech cohomology we have
n+k(A)) = lim

for any A ⊂Cl Xn+k. Hence for ﬁxed k the product α1 ∪ · · · ∪ αk is
deﬁned by the thread
{(qn+m

n+1 )∗(φn+1) ∪ · · · ∪ (qn+m

n+k )∗(φn+k)}m≥k

in the above direct limit. Since βn+m 6= 0, in view of (∗) we obtain that

(qn+m

n+1 )∗(φn+1) ∪ · · · ∪ (qn+m

n+k )∗(φn+k) = ψ1 ∪ · · · ∪ ψk 6= 0.

Hence, α1 ∪ · · · ∪ αk 6= 0 for all k. Therefore, X is cohomologically
strongly inﬁnite dimensional. This contradicts to the assumption. (cid:3)

2.3.3. Corollary. Let X ⊂ Q be a compactum with ﬁnite cohomological
dimension. Then ˜Hi(Q \ X) = 0 for all i.

We recall that the cohomological dimension of a space X with inte-

gers as the coeﬃcients is deﬁned as

dimZ X = sup{n | ∃ A ⊂Cl X with H n(X, A) 6= 0}.

2.3.4. Corollary. Let X ⊂ Q be weakly inﬁnite dimensional com-
pactum. Then ˜Hi(Q \ X) = 0 for all i.

Proof. This is rather a corollary of the proof of Theorem 2.3.2 where we
constructed a nontrivial inﬁnite product of pure relative 1-dimensional
cohomology classes α1 ∪ α2 ∪ . . . . on X. Then the corollary holds true
in view of Proposition 2.2.1.
(cid:3)

3. On weakly infinite dimensional compacta

Let φ ∈ H m−1(K(G, m − 1); G) be the fundamental class. Let ¯φ
denote the image δ(φ) ∈ H m(Cone(K(G, k −1)), K(G, k −1); G) of the
fundamental class under the connecting homomorphism in the exact
sequence of pair.

3.0.5. Proposition. For any pure relative cohomology class α ∈ H m(X, A; G)
there is a map of pairs

f : (X, A) → (Cone(K(G, m − 1)), K(G, m − 1))

such that α = f ∗( ¯φ).

Proof. From the exact sequence of the pair (X, A) it follows that α =
δ(β) for some β ∈ H m−1(A; G). Let g : A → K(G, m − 1) be a
map representing β. Since Cone(K(G, m − 1)) is an AR, there is an
extension f : X → Cone(K(G, m − 1)). Then the commutativity
of the diagram formed by f ∗ and the exact sequence of pairs implies
δg∗(φ) = f ∗δ(φ) = f ∗( ¯φ).
(cid:3)

Corollary 2.3.4 can be derived formally from the following:

3.0.6. Theorem. Every weakly inﬁnite dimensional compactum is rel-
ative cohomology weak for any coeﬃcient ring R.

Proof. Let αi ∈ H ki(X, Ai; R) be a sequence of pure relative classes
with a nontrivial inﬁnite cup-product. We may assume that ki > 1.
We denote Ki = K(R, ki). By Proposition 3.0.5 there are maps fi :
i ( ¯φi) = αi.
(X, Ai) → (Cone(Ki), Ki) representing αi in a sense that f ∗
Let

qi = Cone(c) : Cone(Ki) → Cone(pt) = [0, 1]

be the cone over the constant map c : Ki → {0}. We show that
g = (q1f1, q2f2, . . . ) : X → Q∞
i=1 I is essential. Assume that for some n
the map

gn = (q1f1, q2f2, . . . , qnfn) : X →

is inessential. Then there is a deformation H of gn to a map h : X →
Nǫ(∂I n) rel g−1
n (Nǫ(∂I n)) to the ǫ-neighborhood of the boundary ∂I n.
Since the map q1 × · · · × qn is a ﬁbration over Int I n, there is a lift ¯H
of H that deforms

¯fn = (f1, . . . , fn) : X →

n

Y

i=1

Cone(Ki)

to an ǫ-neighborhood of M = (q1 × · · · × qn)−1(∂I n). Since M is an
ANR we may assume that ¯fn can be deformed to M rel ¯f −1
n (M). Since
α1 ∪ · · · ∪ αn = ¯f ∗
n( ¯φ1 ∪ · · · ∪ ¯φn), to complete the proof it suﬃces to
show that the restriction of ¯φ1 ∪ · · · ∪ ¯φn to M is zero.

We denote

D =

n

i=1

Cone(Ki) \

n

Y

i=1

Ocone(Ki)

where Ocone(K) stands for the open cone. Since Q Cone(Ki) is con-
tractible, φ1 ∪ · · · ∪ φn = δω for some ω ∈ H k1+···+kn−1(D; R).

We show that D is homeomorphic to K1 ∗ · · · ∗ Kn. Note that

n

Y

i=1

Cone(Ki) = {t1x1 + · · · + tnxn | xi ∈ Ki, ti ∈ [0, 1]}

and

n

Y

i=1

Ocone(Ki) = {t1x1 + · · · + tnxn | xi ∈ Ki, ti ∈ [0, 1)}

with the convention that 0x = 0x′. Then the set D consists of all
t1x1 + · · · + tnxn such that ti = 1 for some i. We recall that

K1 ∗ · · · ∗ Kn = {t1x1 + · · · + tnxn | xi ∈ Ki, ti ∈ [0, 1] X ti = 1}

with the same convention. Clearly, the projection of of the unit sphere
in Rn for the max{|xi|} norm onto the unit sphere for the |x1|+· · ·+|xn|
norm is bijective. Thus, the renormalizing map ρ : D → K1 ∗ · · · ∗ Kn,

ρ(t1x1 + · · · + tnxn) =

t1
P ti

x1 + · · · +

tn

xn

is bijective and, hence, is a homeomorphism.

The space M can be deﬁned as follows:

M = {t1x1 + · · · + tnxn | xi ∈ Ki, ti ∈ [0, 1] ∃i : ti ∈ 0, 1}.

Therefore, M = D ∪ L where

L = {t1x1 + · · · + tnxn | xi ∈ Ki, ti ∈ [0, 1] ∃i : ti = 0}.

8

A. AMARASINGHE AND A. DRANISHNIKOV

We note that L is the cone over

L∗ = {t1x1 + · · · + tnxn ∈ K1 ∗ · · · ∗ Kn | ∃i : ti = 0}.

Thus, the space M is obtained by attaching to D the cone over L∗.
We show that the inclusion L∗ → D is null-homotopic. Note that

L∗ =

i=1

K1 ∗ · · · ∗ ˆKi ∗ · · · ∗ Kn

where ˆKi means that the i-factor is missing. Fix points ei ∈ Ki and
the straight-line deformation

t : K1 ∗ · · · ∗ ˆKi ∗ · · · ∗ Kn → K1 ∗ · · · ∗ Kn
hi

to the point ei. We recall that the reduced joint product is deﬁned as
follows

K1˜∗ · · · ˜∗Kn = {t1x1 + · · · + tnxn | xi ∈ Ki, ti ∈ [0, 1], X ti = 1}

with convention that 0x = 0x′ and ei = ej. Let q : K1 ∗ · · · ∗ Kn →
K1˜∗ · · · ˜∗Kn be the quotient map. Note that q has contractible ﬁbers
and hence is a homotopy equivalence. Then ˜x0 = q(∆n−1) is the base
point in the reduced joint product where the simplex ∆n−1 is spanned
by e1, . . . , en.

The deformation hi

t deﬁnes a deformation ˜hi

t of K1˜∗ · · · ˜∗ ˆKi˜∗ · · · ˜∗Kn
to the base point P tiei in the reduced joint product K1˜∗ · · · ˜∗Kn. We
note that for any i < j the deformations ˜hi
t agree on the common
part K1˜∗ · · · ˜∗ ˆKi˜∗ · · · ˜∗ ˆKj˜∗ · · · ˜∗Kn. Therefore, the union (∪˜hi
t) ◦ q|L∗ is
a well-deﬁned deformation of L∗ to the base point in the reduced joint
product where q : K1 ∗ · · · ∗ Kn → K1˜∗ · · · ˜∗Kn is quotient map. Since
q is a homotopy equivalence, L∗ is null-homotopic in K1 ∗ · · · ∗ Kn. (cid:3)

t and ˜hj

Since there exist strongly inﬁnite dimensional compacta with ﬁnite
cohomological dimension (see [D],[DW]) the converse to Theorem 3.0.6
does not hold true.

The following can be easily derived from from the deﬁnition of the
cup product for the singular cohomology and the deﬁnition of the ˇCech
cohomology.

3.0.7. Proposition. Let A, A′ ⊂ Y , Y, B, B′ ⊂ X be closed subsets
with B ∩ Y = A and B′ ∩ Y = A′. Then for any ring R there is a

∪−−−→ H k+l(Y, A ∪ A′; R).

3.0.8. Theorem. Let Y be a closed subset of a compactum X with a
weak relative cohomology over a ring R. Then Y has a weak relative
cohomology over R.

Proof. Assume that Y is cohomologically strongly inﬁnite dimensional.
Let αi ∈ H ki(Y, Ai; R) be pure relative cohomology classes with nonzero
product. Let

fi : (Y, Ai) → (Cone(K(R, ki − 1)), K(R, ki − 1))

be a map from Proposition 3.0.5 representing αi. Let

gi : X → Cone(K(R, ki − 1))

i ( ¯φi) ∈ H ki(X, Bi). Note that αi = ξ∗

be an extension of fi and let Bi = g−1
i (K(R, ki − 1)). We consider
βi = g∗
i (βi) where ξi : (Y, Ai) →
(X, Bi) is the inclusion. By induction, Proposition 3.0.7, and the fact
αi ∪ · · · ∪ αn 6= 0 we obtain that β1 ∪ · · · ∪ βn 6= 0 for all n. Then we can
conclude that X is cohomologically strongly inﬁnite dimensional. (cid:3)

4. Applications

Let Σ denote the linear span of the standard Hilbert cube Q in the
Hilbert space ℓ2 and let Σω denote the product of countably many
copies of Σ. The following is well-known:

4.0.9. Proposition. Let H be either ℓ2 or Σω. Then for any closed
subset A ⊂ Q of the Hilbert cube any embedding φ : A → H can be
extended to an embedding ¯φ : Q → H.

Let Rγ(M) denote the space of all Riemannian metrics on a manifold
M with the C γ topology. For the deﬁnition of such topology for ﬁnite
γ which are not integers we refer to [BB]. The following theorem was
proved in [BB]:

4.0.10. Theorem. For a connected manifold M the space Rγ(M) is
homeomorphic to Σω when γ < ∞ and R∞(M) is homeomorphic to ℓ2.
≥0(R2) is homeomorphic to Σω when γ < ∞ and it is

The space Rγ

not an integer. The space R∞

≥0(R2) is homeomorphic to ℓ2.

This theorem with our main result implies the following

4.0.11. Corollary. Let X ⊂ Rγ(M) be a closed weakly inﬁnite dimen-
sional subset for a connected manifold M . Then Rγ(M) \ X is acyclic.
≥0(R2) be a closed weakly inﬁnite dimensional subset
when γ = ∞ or γ < ∞ and it is not an integer. Then the complement

Proof. In either of the cases we denote the space of metrics by H.
Let f : K → H \ X be a singular cycle. By Proposition 4.0.9 there
is an embedding of the Hilbert cube Q ⊂ H such that f (K) ⊂ Q.
By Theorem 2.3.2 f is homologous to zero in Q \ X and, hence, in
H \ X.
