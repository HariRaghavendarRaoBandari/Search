The theory of general relativity, for which we celebrate the centennial at this Sympo-
sium, is based on the Einstein equivalence principle. This principle could be violated
through a pseudoscalar-photon interaction, which would also produce a rotation of the
polarization angle for radiation traveling over very long distances. Therefore, if we could
show that this cosmic polarization rotation does not exist, our conﬁndence in general rel-
ativity would be greatly increased. We review here the astrophysical searches for cosmic
polarization rotation, which have been made in the past 26 years using the polarization
of radio galaxies and of the cosmic microwave background. So far no rotation has been
detected within about 1 degree. We discuss current problems and future prospects for
cosmic polarization rotation measurements.

Keywords: General relativity; Equivalence principles; Polarization; Radio galaxies; Cos-
mic microwave background.

1. The importance of cosmic polarization rotation

The possibility that space-time is curved by a gravitational ﬁeld, as postulated
by the theory of general relativity (GR), rests on the extension of the equivalence
between an accelerated frame and a gravitational ﬁeld from experiments involving
just moving bodies (the weak or Galilean equivalence principle, WEP 17) to those
concerning all non-gravitational forces, including electromagnetic ﬁelds and photons
(the Einstein equivalence principle, EEP 16). In fact, the trajectory of a photon in
an accelerated frame is curved because of the ﬁnite speed of light, and the same
should equivalently occur in a gravitational ﬁeld. However, this extension from
the WEP to the EEP would not be justiﬁed if there were a pseudoscalar ﬁeld φ
coupling to electromagnetism and leading to a violation of the EEP, while obeying
the WEP. 33,34 Such pseudoscalar ﬁeld, if it existed, would also produce a rotation
of the polarization angle (PA) for radiation traveling over large distances across the
universe, 10 the so called cosmic polarization rotation (CPR). If we could show that
there is no CPR, the EEP would be tested with the same high accuracy of the WEP,
greatly increasing our conﬁdence in the EEP and consequently in GR. In fact CPR
could also be induced by violations of other fundamental physical principles (see
ref. 36 for a recent review), connected with the breaking of symmetry and parity:
clearly, if there were any CPR, i.e. if the CPR angle α were not zero, it should be

either positive for a counter-clockwise rotation, or negative for a clockwise rotation,a
leading to asymmetry.

Searches for CPR are important also to make the best use of the information
about the universe which photons carry to us. Almost all the information we have
about the universe outside the Solar System is carried to us by photons; a few cosmic
rays, several elusive neutrinos, and the just discovered gravitational waves are the
only exceptions. Photons carry information about their direction, their energy (or
wavelength/frequency), and their polarization. The latter consists essentially in the
position angle (PA) of the polarization ellipse, i.e. photons carry throughout the
universe an important geometrical information, although our eyes cannot see it. In
order to make the best use of this information, it is important to know if and how
it is changed while photons travel to us. We know that the direction of photons
can be modiﬁed by a strong gravitational ﬁeld, and that their energy is modiﬁed by
the expansion of the universe. Is the polarization PA also modiﬁed while photons
travel large distances in vacuum?b The searches for CPR deal with this important
question.

In the following I will brieﬂy review the tests on CPR carried out with diﬀerent
methods in the past 26 years, and discuss current problems and future prospects for
these tests. A more extensive recent review of CPR tests can be found in ref. 15.

2. Searches for cosmic polarization rotation

CPR tests are simple in principle: they require a distant source of polarized radi-
ation for which the polarization orientation P Aem at the emission or at the last
interaction can be established. By measuring the observed orientation P Aobs, the
CPR angle can be calculated:

α = P Aobs − P Aem.

The problem is the estimate of P Aem, since it is not generally possible to know
the geometry of the emission process. Fortunately this problem can be solved
when the last interaction was due to scattering and when the scattering geometry
can be ﬁgured out.
In this case we can use the fact that scattered radiation is
polarized perpendicularly to the plane containing the incident and scattered rays.
This simple physical law has been applied to CPR tests, using both the ultraviolet
(UV) radiation of radio galaxies (RG) and the tiny disuniformities of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB). The ﬁrst CPR tests 26 years ago used instead a
stastical analysis of the radio polarization in RG. 9 The most accurate CPR tests

aWe adopt the convention for PA enforced by the International Astronomical Union (IAU): it
increases counter-clockwise facing the source, from North through East. 22
bWe know that the polarization PA is modiﬁed while photons travel in a plasma with a magnetic
ﬁeld, the so called Faraday rotation, which is proportional to the wavelength squared. However
we deal here only with possible modiﬁcations in vacuum.

obtained with the various methods are summarized in Fig. 1, which is derived from
the data of ref. 15.

Blue error bars are for the statistical error, while red ones include also the systematic one, if
present. A systematic error should be added to the ATCPol measurement, equal to the unknown
diﬀerence of the Crab Nebula polarization PA between 146 GHz and 89 GHz. 32

Since this review 15 some new measurements connected with CPR have become
available. The POLARBEAR collaboration 2 reports about a diﬀerence of 1.08◦
in the instrument polarization angle obtained minimizing the EB spectrum and
that obtained from the Crab Nebula using the PA measurement of ref. 6. This
corresponds to a measurement of CPR, performed with the eﬀect of a rotation on
the EB spectrum and using the Crab Nebula for the PA calibration, and giving a
CPR angle α = 1.08◦ ± 0.2◦(stat.) ± 0.5◦(syst.). The BICEP2 collaboration 3 ﬁnds

that TB and EB spectra at high monopoles are consistent with a coherent rotation
of the polarization angle by 1.1◦ with a random error of 0.2◦. However this is not
necessarily a measurement of the CPR angle α, since this TB and EB minimization
procedure 27 cannot disentangle α from a PA systematic error due to calibration
uncertainties (see the next section). Recently the ﬁrst results about CPR from the
Planck satellite have become available: a CPR angle α = 0.0◦±1.3◦(stat.)±1◦(syst.)
has been obtained from an analysis of just TE and EE spectra. 20 However this is not
the ﬁnal word on CPR from Planck, since, when also the BB, TB, and EB spectra
will be included in the analysis, it is foreseen that the statistical uncertainty on the
CPR angle should decrease to about 0.03◦, 20 and hopefully it will also be possible
to decrease the systematic errors with an improved PA calibration.

The CPR tests considered above assume that the rotation angle α is uniform
across the sky. However it is also possible that α depends on the direction one is
looking at 35 and that one can therefore measure its ﬂuctuations hδα2i1/2. The CPR
data obtained on 8 RG 13 have been used to constrain hδα2i1/2 ≤ 3.7◦. 24 A better
constraint hδα2i1/2 . 1◦ has been derived from the WMAP7 data. 18 B-mode CMB
polarization data have been used to set a constraint hδα2i1/2 ≤ 1.56◦. 14

Attempts have been made to derive constraints on CPR by combining data
from various CMB experiments. For example, a CPR angle of 2.12 ±1.14◦ has been
obtained 30 combining the data of BOOMERanG, 37 WMAP9, 21 and BICEP1. 25
However we ﬁnd it problematic to combine data taken at diﬀerent frequencies, in
diﬀerent areas of the sky, and particularly in the presence of large and diﬀerent
systematic errors due to uncertainties in the PA calibration.

In summary, the results so far are consistent with a null CPR with upper limits

of the order of one degree.

3. Current problems in searches for cosmic polarization rotation

Searches for CPR using the UV polarization of RG have reached the limits allowed
by current instrumentation, for the lack of suitable RG, for which the test can be
performed and which are bright enough so that their polarization can be measured
with the available instruments.

The most accurate results are now obtained with the CMB polarization, aver-
aging over large sky areas, i.e. assuming uniform CPR over these areas. A current
problem with CPR searches using the CMB is the calibration of the polarization
PA for the lack of sources with precisely known PA at CMB frequencies. This in-
troduces a systematic error, which is similar to the statistical measurement error,
of the order of 1 degree (see the red error bars in Fig. 1). Recently the polarization
PA of the Crab Nebula (Tau A) for a beam of 5’ and 10’ has been measured with
an accuracy of 0.2◦ at 89.2 GHz. 6 However most CMB polarization measurements
are made at higher frequencies (100–150 GHz) and the Crab Nebula is not visible
from the South Pole, the site of several CMB experiments. In order to overcome
the PA calibration problem, some CMB polarization experiments have used a TB

and EB nulling procedure. 27 However this procedure would eliminate together the
PA systematic error and any CPR angle α, so it cannot be used for CPR tests.

A second problem with CMB tests of CPR is that unfortunately the CMB po-
larimetrists have adopted the convention that the polarization PA increases clock-
wise (looking at the source), which is opposite to the standard convention adopted
by all other polarimetrists for centuries and enforced by the IAU (PA increases
counter-clockwise). 22 This corresponds to a change of the sign of the U Stokes pa-
rameter and is obviously producing problems when comparing measurements with
diﬀerent methods, like for CPR tests, also because the CMB convention has not
been well documented in the CMB polarization papers. The “CMB convention”
has been unfortunately adopted following a software for pixelization on a sphere. 19
However a pixelization software using the IAU convention exists 41 and changing
the sign of the U Stokes parameter does not require any sophisticated software and
can be done easily. 4 Recently the IAU has issued a recommendation that all as-
tronomers, including those working on the CMB, follow the IAU convention for the
PA. 23 It would clearly be desirable that we all use the same convention and avoid
parochialism in Science.

4. Summary and future prospects

All results are so far consistent with a null CPR. The CPR test methods have
reached so an accuracy of the order of 1◦ and upper limits to any rotation of the
same order.

The diﬀerent methods are complementary in many ways. They cover diﬀerent
wavelength ranges and the methods at shorter wavelength have an advantage, if
CPR eﬀects grow with photon energy, as foreseen in some cases 28,29 . They also
reach diﬀerent distances, and the CMB method obviously reaches furthest. However
the relative diﬀerence in light travel time between z = 3 and z = 1100 is only 16%.
Improvements can be expected by better targeted high resolution radio polar-
ization measurements of RGs and quasars, by more accurate UV polarization mea-
surements of RGs with the coming generation of giant optical telescopes, 7,12,38 and
by future CMB polarization measurements such as those from BICEP3. 5. Also the
ﬁnal results by the Planck satellite 1 are foreseen to bring improvements for CPR
measurements because of the small expected statistical error (see Section 2).
In
any case, in order to exploit its great accuracy, Planck will have to reduce accord-
ingly also the systematic error in the calibration of the polarization angle, which at
the moment is of the order of 1◦ for the CMB polarization experiments. The best
prospects to achieve this improvement are likely to be more precise measurements
of the polarization angle of celestial sources at CMB frequencies with ATCA 31 and
with ALMA, 39 and a calibration source on a satellite. 26
