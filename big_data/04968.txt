Abstract

We report observations of bright dots (BDs) in a sunspot penumbra using High Resolution Coronal
Imager (Hi-C) data in 193 ˚A and examine their sizes, lifetimes, speeds, and intensities. The sizes of the
BDs are on the order of 1(cid:48)(cid:48) and are therefore hard to identify in the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA) 193 ˚A images, which have 1.2(cid:48)(cid:48) spatial resolution, but become readily apparent with Hi-C’s ﬁve
times better spatial resolution. We supplement Hi-C data with data from AIA’s 193 ˚A passband to
see the complete lifetime of the BDs that appeared before and/or lasted longer than Hi-C’s 3-minute
observation period. Most Hi-C BDs show clear lateral movement along penumbral striations, toward
or away from the sunspot umbra. Single BDs often interact with other BDs, combining to fade away
or brighten. The BDs that do not interact with other BDs tend to have smaller displacements. These
BDs are about as numerous but move slower on average than Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph
(IRIS) BDs, recently reported by Tian et al. (2014), and the sizes and lifetimes are on the higher
end of the distribution of IRIS BDs. Using additional AIA passbands, we compare the lightcurves of
the BDs to test whether the Hi-C BDs have transition region (TR) temperature like that of the IRIS
BDs. The lightcurves of most Hi-C BDs peak together in diﬀerent AIA channels indicating that their
temperature is likely in the range of the cooler TR (1 − 4 × 105 K).

INTRODUCTION

In the past few decades, high resolution images from
space telescopes have allowed solar astronomers to view
and analyze the Sun in unprecedented detail. The
data from the High Resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-
C: Kobayashi et al. 2014) yield new information about
small-scale structures in the corona and chromosphere-
corona transition region (TR), including braiding in coro-
nal loops, triggering of subﬂares in them, and signatures
of nanoﬂares and impulsive heating (e.g., Cirtain et al.
2013; Winebarger et al. 2013; Thalmann et al. 2014; Ti-
wari et al. 2014). This paper examines a sunspot in Hi-
C’s ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) with particular attention to the
penumbra. A sunspot consists of the inner, darker um-
bra, and the outer, lighter (but darker than quiet Sun)
penumbra. The umbra has strong nearly vertical mag-
netic ﬁeld, with umbral-dots and light-bridges in it as sig-
natures of magnetoconvection (e.g., Sobotka et al. 1993;
Weiss 2002; Rimmele 2008; Riethm¨uller et al. 2013).
The magnetic ﬁeld inclination in the penumbra greatly
varies azimuthally at small-scales (Solanki 2003; Mathew
et al. 2003; Tiwari et al. 2009; Borrero & Ichimoto 2011;
Scharmer & Henriques 2012; Tiwari et al. 2013, 2015).
The penumbra is known for its ﬁlaments, horizontal ten-
drils that extend outward from the umbra. Penumbral
ﬁlaments contain a general outﬂow (the Evershed ﬂow:
Evershed 1909);
localized up- and downﬂows at their
heads (ends of ﬁlaments closer to sunspot center) and
tails, respectively. Penumbral ﬁlaments have a stretched
granule shape and reversed polarity edge ﬁeld sustained
by lateral downﬂows (Rempel 2012; Tiwari et al. 2013).

In addition to the dynamic features in the photosphere
in sunspots e.g., p-modes,
inward motion of penum-
bral grains, moving magnetic features (Harvey & Harvey
1973), there exist chromospheric and coronal dynamic
features in sunspots e.g., umbral ﬂashes and running
penumbral waves (Zirin & Stein 1972), and penumbral
jets (Katsukawa et al. 2007; Jurˇc´ak & Katsukawa 2008;
Tiwari et al. 2016). There have been only limited in-
vestigations of the smaller dynamic events owing to the
limited simultaneous temporal and spatial resolution of
observations.

Using data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectro-
graph (IRIS: De Pontieu et al. 2014), Tian et al. (2014)
recently discovered bright dots (BDs), another dynamic
feature, in the TR of sunspots. The BDs are most nu-
merous in penumbrae but are also present in umbrae
and light-bridges. The penumbral BDs observed by IRIS
move along the direction of penumbral ﬁlaments with
speeds of 10–40 km s−1, and appear slightly elongated
along the ﬁlaments, with the two dimensions being 300–
600 km and 250–450 km, respectively. The lifetimes of
the IRIS BDs are mostly less than one minute, some last-
ing for a few minutes. Many of these BDs were proposed
to be signatures of small-scale energy release events at
the TR footpoints of coronal magnetic loops.

In this Paper, we report on Hi-C observations of BDs
in a sunspot penumbra. We measure and compare the
physical characteristics of these Hi-C penumbral BDs to
the IRIS penumbral BDs and use diﬀerent Atmospheric
Imaging Assemply (AIA: Lemen et al. 2012) channels to
explore the temperature of the Hi-C BDs.

2. OBSERVATION AND DATA ANALYSIS

We use Hi-C 193 ˚A data taken on July 11, 2012 during
18:52:43–18:55:30 UT. The entire Hi-C FOV is shown in
Figure 1a. Hi-C data has a cadence of 5.5 seconds and a
plate scale of 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48)pixel−1. The sunspot that is the main
focus of this research is centered south-east of disk center,
at (−122(cid:48)(cid:48), −325(cid:48)(cid:48)). A 40(cid:48)(cid:48)× 40(cid:48)(cid:48) FOV around this point
is used for most of the analysis. The blue inset in Figure
1a indicates the Hi-C 40(cid:48)(cid:48)× 40(cid:48)(cid:48) FOV used in this study,
enlargement of which is shown in Figure 1b. Due to the
Hi-C data’s short duration and for comparison reasons,
supplemental 193 ˚A data is used from SDO/AIA. AIA
has a cadence of 12 seconds (24 seconds for UV channels)
and a plate scale of 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48) pixel−1. Figure 1c is the same
FOV and time of observation as Figure 1b, but shows
SDO/AIA 193˚A data. Hi-C BDs are indicated by the
smaller contours. Evidently, BDs are present in both
umbra and penumbra of the sunspot, most of them being
in penumbra.
In this Paper, we have focused on the
penumbral BDs.

Additional AIA data is used from the 1600, 304, 171,
and 211 ˚A passbands to examine BD visibility at dif-
ferent atmospheric heights/temperatures. To compare
the same FOV across instruments, same subregion of the
AIA 193 ˚A image was extracted to match the Hi-C FOV.
These AIA 193 ˚A coordinates were then used for the
other AIA channels alignments.

When examining the sunspot, we ﬁnd small, roundish,
BDs. Any compact transient blob that appears brighter
than the surrounding area is considered a BD. To iden-
tify, track, and measure the BDs easily, we smooth the
images (20 × 20 pixels for Hi-C and 7 × 7 pixels for AIA)
and subtract them from the originals. The enhanced im-
ages can be seen in comparison to the original images in
Movie1. It must be noted that although we used the en-
hanced images to more easily identify the BDs, all size,
intensity, lifetime, speed, and lightcurve measurements
were made using the original images.

Figure 2 shows examples of diﬀerent types of BDs that
are seen in the sunspot penumbra. The image sequences
display the lateral drift and brightness evolution of the
BDs over the Hi-C observing period. Figure 2a shows a
single stationary BD. Figure 2b shows a single BD that
moves away from the umbra. Figure 2c shows two sepa-
rate BDs moving towards each other before combining to
form one larger, brighter BD. Figure 2d shows a triple-
system of BDs; a larger BD splits to become two sepa-
rate, smaller BDs and one of these then combines with
a third BD. Unlike the combined, large BDs in Figure
2c, the BDs in Figure 2d fade as they merge. It must
be noted that all BD motion, if motion is seen at all, is
along the direction of the penumbral ﬁlamentary struc-
tures. During its lifetime, a BD may move inward and
outward, i.e., oscillatory motion is commonly seen. To
look at all of the BDs in the sunspot, see Movie1.

We tracked 30 BDs by eye and characterized them. To
get the best sense of the movement and overall changes of
the BDs, we picked one at a time and tracked through-
out the length of the movie, combining Hi-C and AIA
data. We repeated this for a few movie cycles, and for
each of 30 BDs. Note that for the BDs that separate
into smaller BDs, a variety of motion is seen after the

split; the individual BDs may move apart, remain sta-
tionary, one moves while the other remains stationary,
or they may recombine to either form a larger, brighter
BD (Figure 2c) or fade away (Figure 2d). The longest-
lived BDs tend to be the ones that are large, bright, and
isolated (no interaction with other BDs).

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 3 shows histograms of the size, intensity, life-
time, and speed measurements of the 30 BDs that we
selected in this sunspot penumbra. This ﬁgure is similar
to Figure 3 of Tian et al. (2014) and we replicate their
measurement methods closely in order to make the best
comparisons between the properties of IRIS BDs and our
BDs. Figures 3a,b,c depict how the size was determined.
Noticing the slightly non-circular shape of the BDs and in
being consistent with the techniques used by Tian et al.
(2014), we measured length and width for each BD. The
measurement was taken when the BD was the brightest.
Figure 3a shows one example BD in the normal inten-
sity image. The length, measured along the black line,
is in the local direction of the penumbral striation. The
width is measured along the red line, perpendicular to
the length cut. Figure 3b shows the same dot as in 3a,
but from the enhanced image, which is used to determine
the direction and placement of the dots.

In Figure 3c, we show plots of intensity along each cut
ﬁtted with a Gaussian. Please note that a non-constant
background is used when ﬁtting the Gaussian. The size
of the dot (length and width) is the full-width at half-
maximum of the Gaussian. Figure 3d displays the dis-
tribution of 30 BD lengths and widths; the length has a
mean of 557 km and standard deviation of 252 km while
the width has a mean of 472 km and a standard devia-
tion of 185 km. Figure 3e is the length-to-width ratio,
showing that about half of the BDs are longer than they
are wide. On average, BDs are not signiﬁcantly larger
in their direction of motion than in the orthogonal di-
rection. Figure 3f shows the intensity enhancement of
each BD, measured as the brightness of the brightest
part of the dot divided by the background brightness,
which is estimated by averaging intensities of many pixels
surrounding the BD. Average BDs are just under twice
brighter than their surroundings.

The histogram in Figure 3g represents the lifetime of
the BDs, tracked manually and supplemented with AIA
193 ˚A data for the longer-lasting BDs. Most of them
last 1–5 minutes, but several survive for 12–14 minutes.
The longer-lasting BDs are normally the bright, large,
stationary ones and are closer to the sunspot umbra.

Figure 3h displays a histogram of the speed of the BDs.
To calculate the speed of the BDs, we track the center
of the BD as it moves. The tracking is done as follows.
The initial location of the center of the BD is recorded
and then the image is advanced in time. The location
is then recorded again. The velocity is calculated by di-
viding the distance the center of the BD moved by the
time between recordings. The image was then advanced
again and this process is repeated until the BD disap-
pears or merges with another BD. Because the lifetime of
the BDs is variable, the time between recordings varies,
but as a general rule, the number of recordings is maxi-
mized (minimizing the time between each recording) but
there are at least 11 seconds between each recording. The

average velocity of a BD is the average of these multi-
ple velocity measurements. The speed was measured for
only 25 BDs because there were not enough data points
for ﬁve of the BDs. Figure 3i is a scatterplot between the
speed and the ratio of length-to-width of the BDs. We
plot this ﬁgure in an attempt to ﬁnd a correlation be-
tween how long a BD is relative to how fast it is moving
(the thought being that faster BDs might be elongated
in the radial direction), but evidently there is no clear
relationship; there is perhaps a slight tendency for faster
BDs to have less elongation.

To investigate the formation mechanism and temper-
ature of these BDs, we obtained their lightcurves from
ﬁve AIA channels. Figure 4 shows the lightcurves of
four of our BDs. These lightcurves are made by tracking
the BD from when it ﬁrst begins to brighten, through
peak intensity, and ending when it fades from view or
gets dim enough. To measure the intensity, we ﬁrst ﬁnd
the target BD using the Hi-C 193 ˚A images and then
match the location to the AIA 193 ˚A images. We center
a circle on the BD’s brightest part and measure the in-
tensity inside. The frame is advanced and the intensity

is measured for the new time, again with the circle cen-
tered on the brightest part of the BD. In this way, we
track the BD’s peak brightness over its lifetime or over
its brightest peak during its lifetime. This intensity is
then normalized to the highest intensity over the period.
We use four AIA wavelengths in addition to the 193 ˚A:
211, 171, 1600, and 304 ˚A. The AIA 171, 193, and 211
channels are typically coronal, as their response functions
peak at temperatures of roughly 1, 1.5, and 2.5 MK, re-
spectively (Lemen et al. 2012). However, all of these
channels have cooler-TR lines in the passband and hence
have some response in the cooler-TR temperature range
(e.g., O’Dwyer et al. 2010). The 304 and 1600 channels
both respond to cooler-TR emission.
If the BDs have
cooler-TR temperature then these diﬀerent wavelength
channels, which all have some sensitivity to emission
from plasma at TR temperature, will peak at the same
time (Winebarger et al. 2013). If the BDs are heated to
(and cooling from) coronal temperatures, then the dif-
ferent channels will not peak at the same time. Figure 4
shows the lightcurves of a few representative BDs, show-
ing that the diﬀerent wavelengths do peak at the same
time.
These lightcurves indicate that the BD plasma is at
cooler-TR temperatures (1 − 4 × 105 K); its appearance
in AIA coronal channels is due to leakage of low temper-
ature emission into the predominantly coronal channels.
Note that the lightcurves before and/or after the peak
brightness need not necessarily be in phase.

After determining the characteristics of the BDs that
we see with Hi-C, we compare them to the BDs seen
by Tian et al. (2014) using the IRIS telescope. Table 1
compares our measured BD values with those found in
Tian et al. (2014). All listed values are averages.

Tian et al. (2014) did not calculate average speed be-
cause they measured dot velocities, i.e., they included
the direction the dot moves in their data. In this work,
we measure the speed of the BD as the distance traveled
by the center of the BD over time, without reference to
the direction of travel. We deduce from Table 1 that
our BDs are, on average, larger, longer-lived, and slower
than the dots seen in the TR with IRIS. These results and
our ﬁnding from the lightcurves that the Hi-C BDs have
cooler-TR temperature implies that Hi-C detects only
the brighter BDs seen by IRIS. The smaller and dimmer
BDs are probably masked by the Fe XII emission of the
overlying corona.

Based on our analysis, there are several diﬀerent mech-
anisms that could be the cause of these BDs. Because the
BDs are at the feet of coronal loops, cooled plasma that
ﬂows down along the loops could hit the lower, denser at-
mosphere and create shocks that locally heat the plasma

and cause an increase in intensity; this requires super-
sonic downﬂow (∼200 km s−1) (Kleint et al. 2014). The
heating could also be due to the intricate,
interlaced
magnetic ﬁelds of the penumbra repeatedly reconnect-
ing; the radially inward/outward motion of BDs might
result from sliding reconnection between the two inclined
penumbral ﬁeld components (spines and bulk of penum-
bral ﬁlaments). Also using Hi-C data, R´egnier et al.
(2014) found EUV bright dots at the edges of active re-
gions which have a characteristic diameter of 680 km and
a duration of 25 s; they proposed impulsive energy release
in the coronal loops (Parker 1988) rooted in the dots be-
ing responsible for those dots. Ubiquitous chromospheric
bright grains have also been observed in coronal holes
and the quiet Sun, also on the order of 1(cid:48)(cid:48)in diameter
and lasting 1.5–2.5 minutes (e.g., Mart´ınez-Sykora et al.
2015).

Running penumbral waves (Zirin & Stein 1972; Moore
1973; Bloomﬁeld et al. 2007), which are driven by photo-
spheric p-mode oscillations, could perhaps be responsible
for the oscillatory motion of some of the BDs. These
waves could cause the BDs to move along ﬁeld lines
rooted in the penumbra. However, there are very slow
moving and stationary BDs present near the BDs that
oscillate; this casts doubt on running penumbral waves
as the cause of all of our BDs.

The slowest moving or stationary BDs might be at the
heads of penumbral ﬁlaments (Tiwari et al. 2013), also
known as penumbral grains (Muller 1973; Rimmele &
Marino 2006). Those BDs might then be the result of
opposite polarity ﬁelds at the sides of ﬁlaments recon-
necting with the surrounding spines. This mechanism
would also create penumbral jets (Katsukawa et al. 2007),
as proposed by Tiwari et al. (2016). Thus, some penum-
bral jets and BDs perhaps have the same location and
same cause. This proposal is similar to the one given
by Vissers et al. (2015) that some penumbral BDs are
the heating signatures of penumbral jets. However, from
Figure 2 of Tiwari et al. (2016) we ﬁnd evidence that
most of the Hi-C penumbral BDs do not coincide with
penumbral jets. As pointed out by Tian et al. (2014),
some of the BDs concievably could be produced by mov-
ing magnetic features (Zhang et al. 2003; Ravindra 2006;
Sainz Dalda & Bellot Rubio 2008).

4. CONCLUSIONS

We observe BDs in the penumbra of a sunspot using
193 ˚A data from the Hi-C. Their lateral motion is in-
ward or outward from the sunspot center, following the
direction of penumbral ﬁlaments. We compare our BDs
to those found by Tian et al. (2014) in the TR using
the IRIS telescope. Our BDs are 300–800 km long and
300–600 km wide, last 1–5 minutes or longer, are double
the intensity of the surrounding regions, and move 3–15
km s−1.
In general, they are larger, longer-lived, and
slower than the IRIS BDs. Based on the lightcurves ob-
tained using supplemental AIA data, most of the plasma
in our BDs is probably at cooler-TR temperature, but
the data is widely varied and subject to resolution and
temporal constraints. The cause of these BDs is an open
question. They are conceivably a consequence of plasma
downﬂow impacting the TR or upper-chromosphere den-
sity, or of reconnection between two inclined components
of penumbral magnetic ﬁeld (more vertical spine ﬁeld

and more horizontal ﬁeld in the bulk of penumbral ﬁla-
ments), perhaps sometimes triggered by running penum-
bral waves. The Hi-C BDs belong to the class of TR
penumbral BDs found in IRIS data by Tian et al. (2014),
and have possible counterparts at the edges of active re-
gions in the corona and/or TR (R´egnier et al. 2014).
