We present a uniﬁed evolution of the universe from very early times until the present epoch
by including both the leading local correction R2 and the leading non–local term R 1(cid:3)2 R to the
classical gravitational action. We ﬁnd that the inﬂationary phase driven by R2 term gracefully
exits in a transitory regime characterized by coherent oscillations of the Hubble parameter. The
universe then naturally enters into a radiation dominated epoch followed by a matter dominated
era. At suﬃciently late times after radiation–matter equality, the non–local term starts to dominate
inducing an accelerated expansion of the universe at the present epoch. We further exhibit the fact
that both the leading local and non–local terms can be obtained within the covariant eﬀective ﬁeld
theory of gravity. This scenario thus provides a uniﬁed picture of inﬂation and dark energy in a
single framework by means of a purely gravitational action without the usual need of a scalar ﬁeld.

Introduction. Cosmological observations strongly
support the idea that the universe underwent an early
period of accelerated expansion called inﬂation [1, 2]. Be-
sides, local supernovae measurements [3, 4] also suggest
that the universe is experiencing a phase of acceleration
at the present epoch, caused by dark energy [5]. Whether
there exists a deeper and fundamental connection be-
tween the two (or not), an interesting question to ask
is if it is possible to unify both these epochs in a single
framework with minimal degrees of freedom. Such sce-
narios have been explored by using matter ﬁelds (scalar
ﬁelds with an appropriate potential) as well as by mod-
ifying gravity. Within General Relativity (GR) and in
the absence of a cosmological constant, it is not possible
to explain either inﬂation or dark energy without adding
extra degrees of freedom and therefore, these two epochs
are very novel consequences of physics beyond classical
GR described by the Einstein–Hilbert (EH) action. The
framework of the covariant Eﬀective Field Theory (EFT)
of quantum gravity, developed in [6, 7], predicts both lo-
cal and non–local correction terms which then become
natural candidates for driving inﬂation and dark energy
thereby allowing us to construct a uniﬁed picture of the
universe. The key advantage of using EFT methods is
that they allow to compute such corrections from ﬁrst
principles even in the absence of a complete theory of
quantum gravity [8–11].

In addition to scalar ﬁelds, an inﬂationary epoch in the
early universe can also be driven by higher order curva-
ture corrections to the EH action, notably by a R2 term –
a scenario ﬁrst proposed by Starobinsky [12] and further
discussed in [13]. This scenario is one of the simplest and
oldest model of inﬂation based on purely gravitational
corrections. Albeit the existence of a large number of
inﬂationary models, Starobinsky inﬂation should be one
of the most probable among all from an Occam’s razor

point of view and also turns out to be the most preferred
model with the highest Bayesian evidence in the recent
datasets [2, 14]. The presence of higher order curvature
terms (including the derivatives) can be understood by
means of one–loop quantum corrections to the EH action
as suggested in [12] and extended, for example, in [15].
In the covariant EFT of gravity, we found that a R2 term
naturally arises as a leading local correction to the EH
action and becomes responsible for driving inﬂation at
early times without the need of additional matter ﬁelds.
Thus, inﬂation in this set–up is entirely a feature of the
leading corrections in the gravitational sector [7].

Within the framework of GR, cosmic acceleration at
the present epoch can be achieved by adding a cosmolog-
ical constant Λ and is indeed the simplest possibility. Re-
cently, it has been realized that speciﬁc curvature square
non–local terms can also drive the current acceleration
of the universe. In particular, the non–local term R 1(cid:3)2 R
leads to a very interesting phenomenology as it eﬀectively
behaves like a cosmological constant as R/(cid:3) → 1 at late
times. This term has been argued as a consistent IR
modiﬁcation of GR and the theory together with the EH
action remains free of any propagating ghost–like degree
of freedom or other instabilities [16]. This scenario pro-
vides a viable alternative to dynamical dark energy and
has been greatly studied including the study of cosmolog-
ical perturbations and other observable imprints [17, 18].
In order to understand the origin of such non–local terms
in a consistent framework, we have recently shown that
various non–local terms appear at the second order in
a curvature expansion [6, 7]. However, the R 1(cid:3)2 R term
among others is the most relevant one for dark energy due
to being roughly a constant at late times. Lately, mod-
iﬁcations of GR including the Weyl–square term, also
predicted by the covariant EFT [6], have also been stud-
ied. Such terms do not contribute to the background

inﬂationary stage, passing through a transitionary phase characterized by strong coherent oscillations, followed by radiation

expansion but only to the evolution of cosmological per-
turbations [19].

In this Letter, we present a uniﬁed evolution of the
universe from very early times until the present epoch
by including both the leading local correction R2 and
the leading non–local contribution R 1(cid:3)2 R to the EH ac-
tion together with radiation and matter. We ﬁnd that
the initial inﬂationary epoch induced by the R2 term ex-
ists into a transitory regime with coherent and damped
oscillations of the Hubble parameter and could be char-
acterized as reheating in this scenario. This phase then
naturally enters into a radiation dominated epoch fol-
lowed by a matter dominated era. At suﬃciently late
times, the non–local term becomes dominant and leads
to a dark energy dominated universe with equation of
state w ≤ −1. This set–up provides a uniﬁed picture
of our universe from earliest epochs until today thereby
unifying both inﬂation and dark energy in a single frame-
work by means of purely gravitational corrections to the
EH action. Later we will show that these corrections are
naturally present in the covariant EFT of gravity.

A uniﬁed scenario. We are interested in studying
the evolution of the universe in a scenario wherein the
leading local quadratic term is combined with the most
relevant IR non–local terms. The total eﬀective action
including the matter part Sm is then given by

ergy density today leads to m ∼ 0.3√H0MPl. The spe-
ciﬁc non–local term R 1(cid:3)2 R has been chosen since it is the
simplest that can eﬀectively emulate a cosmological con-
stant term since R 1(cid:3)2 R ∼ 1 as R/(cid:3) → 1 at late times.
This term as an alternative to dark energy was ﬁrst pro-
posed in [16]. The eﬀective action in (1) is the minimal
uniﬁed action (with deviations from GR of purely grav-
itational character) capable of describing inﬂation and
dark energy together in a single framework sans a cos-
mological constant. It was ﬁrst proposed in [7, 18] and
later also suggested in [20].

In order to understand the implications of this ef-
fective action for our universe, we work in a (3 + 1)–
dimensional, spatially ﬂat, FRW spacetime described by
the line element ds2 = −dt2 + a2(t)dx2 where a(t) is the
scale factor. Einstein’s equations can now be written as
Gµν + ∆Gµν = Tµν/M 2
Pl, where ∆Gµν corresponds to
the correction terms arising from the local and non–local
terms in (1). It is evident that ∆Gµν is covariantly con-
served and its explicit form can be found in [7]. The
modiﬁed Friedmann equations of motion (EOM) can be
obtained by varying this action

and Ωde vs log a. All the salient features of Fig. 2 are clearly
evident here.

suﬃciently late times after equality, the non–local term
R 1(cid:3)2 R which was so far subdominant starts to become
relevant and drives the current acceleration of the uni-
verse, due to the fact that R 1(cid:3)2 R → 1 as R/(cid:3) → 1 at
the present epoch. The eﬀects of this non–local term
are studied by solving the modiﬁed Friedmann equation
numerically, as shown in Fig. 1 and also discussed in [16].

Moreover, we are also interested in understanding the
imprints of the non–local term using an analytical ap-
proach in the background of both radiation and matter.
It is useful to note that in terms of the conformal time

τ =(cid:82) dt/a(t), the Friedmann equation including only ra-
solution is a(τ )/aeq = (2√2 − 2) (τ /τeq) + (1 − 2√2 +

Pl/ρeq. Here,
ρeq, aeq and τeq are the energy density, scale factor and
conformal time at the epoch of radiation–matter equality,
respectively. Using this background solution in a closed
form, we have solved the Friedmann EOM corresponding
to the non–local term with initial conditions U = S = 0
and U(cid:48) = S(cid:48) = 0. We have also treated the contribu-
tions from the non–local term when taken on the right
hand side of the EOM as an eﬀective dark energy den-
sity.
In Fig. 2, we have plotted the total equation of
state parameter w as a function of log a.
It is evident
from the ﬁgure that the universe starting from radiation
epoch (w = 1/3) smoothly transits to the matter domi-
nated regime (w = 0) which then evolves in the present
epoch dominated by the non–local term with w ≤ −1.
For later discussion we have also shown the correspond-
ing behavior for the leading non–local term R 1−(cid:3) R but
found that only R 1(cid:3)2 R leads to an accelerating universe
today. Moreover, in Fig. 3, we have plotted the di-
mensionless energy density ratio Ωr, Ωm and Ωde as a
function of log a which perfectly corroborates the behav-

FIG. 2. We plot the total equation of state parameter w vs.
log a from radiation epoch until today. The imprints due to
the ﬁrst two non-local terms R 1−(cid:3) R and R 1(cid:3)2 R in the eﬀective
action are compared. It is evident that R 1(cid:3)2 R eﬀectively leads
to w (cid:39) −1 at the present epoch.

S = 1(cid:3)2 R, respectively. We also deﬁne the mass scale
characterizing inﬂation as M 2 ≡ ξM 2
Pl. The modiﬁed
Friedmann EOM must be solved together with the conti-
nuity equations for radiation and matter which are given
by ˙ρi + 3H(1 + wi)ρi = 0, where i = {r, m} with wr = 1/3
and wm = 0. At early times when local corrections are
most relevant, our scenario reduces to the Starobinsky
model and naturally describes inﬂation. To achieve suﬃ-
cient e–folds of inﬂation, the time derivate of the Hubble
parameter at an initial time can be appropriately tuned.
The CMB normalization instead determines the value of
the coupling ξ. Note that, as pointed out in [7], R + R2
gravity is not exactly solvable due to the non–linear na-
ture of the equations. However, at suﬃciently early times
when R2 is dominant over the EH term, the theory ad-
mits a quasi de-Sitter solution leading to Starobinsky in-
ﬂation. This is depicted by the constant H solution on
the left in Fig. 1. Note that, the universe in this scenario
gracefully exits from inﬂation and enters into an oscilla-
tory regime. We obtain the oscillatory solution for the
Hubble parameter numerically but one can also gain an
analytical understanding of their origin by ignoring some
higher order terms in the modiﬁed Friedmann EOM [7].
We stress that this transient oscillatory regime is very
novel and generic feature of our scenario which can be
considered as the reheating epoch in this set–up. This
could in principle have interesting observable imprints.
We leave the study of the details of the reheating stage
and its possible imprints to future work.

After the oscillatory phase is over, the universe natu-
rally enters into the radiation dominated epoch. After
radiation–matter equality, the universe then evolves in
a matter dominated era as clearly shown in Fig. 1. At

sistent with observations today, we can also obtain the
value of the mass scale m of the non–local term to be
m ∼ 0.3√H0MPl ∼ 5.7 × 10−4 eV.

Covariant EFT of gravity. As we have seen, the ef-
fective action in (1) is very appealing from a phenomeno-
logical perspective since it can naturally describe all the
diﬀerent phases through which the universe has evolved,
but can it have a deeper origin or interpretation? Under
which assumptions is it a good low energy description of
quantum gravity? We will discuss here how the model (1)
can be justiﬁed from low energy quantum gravity when
this is treated by means of EFT methods.

Since we are interested in studying the evolution of the
whole universe, the EFT approach must be developed
in a covariant way in order to derive an eﬀective action
valid on an arbitrary spacetime and in particular FRW.
In our previous paper [6], we have computed the leading
order EFT action to the second order in the curvatures.
The ﬁnal result for the gravitational part of the eﬀective
action is given by

where the structure function F is completely determined
once the matter content of the theory is speciﬁed. The
general form of the structure function can be found in
[6]. The action depends on two parameters ξ and m.
The ﬁrst is free to tune while the second is in principle
related to some mass scale of the underlying theory. On
FRW the Weyl tensor vanishes identically and therefore
we have not reported the Weyl part of the eﬀective action
(3) since it will not contribute to the background EOM.
However, this is not true when dealing with cosmological
perturbations and the contributions due to these terms
must be taken into account which could lead to very dis-
tinct signatures in the cosmological observables [19].

The structure function F is non–local in the low energy

where the coeﬃcients α, β, γ and δ are indeed predictions
of the EFT of gravity which ultimately depend only on
the ﬁeld content of the theory and are listed in [6]. We
recognize in (4) the appearance of the non–local term
R 1(cid:3)2 R assumed in the model (1), but even if there ex-
ists speciﬁc matter choices that can make one or more
of these coeﬃcients vanish, in the general case these are
all non–zero and so all other non–local terms are in prin-
ciple present [7] in the eﬀective action. Non–local mod-
iﬁcations of GR based on one or more of the operators

4

in (4) have been considered by many authors, see for ex-
ample [21–31] and references therein. In order to justify
the model (1) we need to show that indeed the operator
R 1(cid:3)2 R dominates the late time evolution of the universe.
For this reason in Fig. 2 we have compared the equa-
tion of state parameter for a dark energy ﬂuid generated
by the ﬁrst two non–local terms R 1−(cid:3) R and R 1(cid:3)2 R. As
can be seen, only the latter is capable of changing the
late time evolution while the ﬁrst only aﬀects the inter-
mediate regime. The terms containing the log opera-
tors are more delicate to deﬁne and have been discussed
in [6]. The analysis shows that their behavior is sub–
leading with respect to the relative operator without the
log and so to ﬁrst approximation can be discarded. The
−(cid:3)
m2 R term may be relevant at early times but in our
R log
model this epoch is dominated by the local R2. Finally,
due to the smallness of the mass scale m, all higher order
operators will be suppressed by large additional factors
and to ﬁrst approximation can also be discarded. Of the
terms contained in the expansion (4) the one dominant
at late times is thus the one included in equation (1) and
the eﬀective action (1) is in principle justiﬁable from ﬁrst
principles via EFT arguments.

As discussed in [6], the eﬀective action also contains
many new non–local operators with three or more curva-
tures, as for example R 1−(cid:3) R 1−(cid:3) R. Within these there is
also the contribution from the conformal anomaly. These
operators may have interesting cosmological implications
(see for instance [32, 33] and references therein) and, even
if sub–leading when compared with the two curvature
terms considered in this Letter, their eﬀects should be
studied carefully, for a recent discussion, see [20, 34].

grav = 2 V (v)/M 2

Finally, we can try to answer the question: what is
m? In the case of scalars and fermions, m is the eﬀective
mass of the particle. For these cases the mass required
for observational consistency is m ∼ 0.57 meV which
makes it a very light particle. Photons do not contribute
while gravitons can induce an eﬀective gravitational mass
m2
Pl (where V (ϕ) is the scalar potential
with v its minimum). Such a light particle must have
been relativistic all its life during the evolution of the
universe and would contribute to the eﬀective number
of relativistic degrees of freedom Neﬀ . For instance, a
light scalar in equilibrium with the same temperature
as neutrinos would lead to a departure of Neﬀ from the
standard value of 4/7 [35]. The presence of such extra
degrees of freedom can therefore be tightly constrained
using Planck and other observations [36]. Furthermore,
structure formation can also be used to constrain the im-
prints of such light particles. It has been shown recently
that the diﬀerence between the predictions of the non–
local model R 1(cid:3)2 R and ΛCDM is small with respect to
the present observational errors [17]. This is somewhat
expected as neutrinos, for instance, being very light with

(cid:80) mν (cid:46) 0.23 eV induce only sub–leading corrections at a

few percent level to ΛCDM at small scales and a similar

conclusion can be anticipated for the even lighter parti-
cle in our scenario. A more detailed analysis to judge the
consistency of this picture will require studying the cos-
mological evolution of the full model (3) with the exact
structure function F before the simplifying expansion (4)
[37]. A diﬀerent microscopic interpretation of the mass
scale m has been proposed in [18].

Discussion and outlook.

In this Letter we have
studied a simple yet elegant scenario which generalizes
GR by including leading local R2 and leading non–local
R 1(cid:3)2 R terms to the action. We have derived the mod-
iﬁed Friedman EOM by evaluating the generalized Ein-
stein’s equations on an FRW background which are sub-
sequently solved by a combination of analytical and nu-
merical methods. Our main result is that the solution,
depicted in Fig. 1, exhibits a uniﬁed and consistent evo-
lution of the universe that starts from an inﬂationary
regime at very early times and ends in a dark energy
phase at the present epoch.

In particular, we have found that the transition be-
tween the end of inﬂation to the radiation epoch is char-
acterized by strong coherent oscillations of the Hubble
parameter which may be interpreted as a concrete real-
ization of the reheating phase. These oscillations orig-
inate from the competition between R and R2 contri-
butions and are indeed a precise and distinct feature of
our scenario (when the theory is treated consistently in
the Jordan frame). After this transient oscillatory phase,
the universe naturally enters the Einstein regime with
radiation domination followed by a matter dominated
era. Eventually, the non–local term starts to dominate
and drives the evolution of the universe, behaving as
a dynamical and purely gravitational dark energy with
w ≤ −1. Thus, the model (1) is able to describe the
evolution of the universe through all the epochs and is
characterized by only two new parameters ξ and m. The
oscillatory phase it predicts may have characteristic ob-
servable imprints which should be analyzed more care-
fully.

We emphasize that the uniﬁed scenario we studied is
not only phenomenological but can be justiﬁed using an
eﬀective approach to low energy quantum gravity. The
mass scale m can either be identiﬁed with the mass of a
very light species or with the eﬀective gravitational mass.
This connection is not only satisfactory from a theoretical
point of view but it also provides a way to reduce the
number of free parameters by linking m to the underlying
theory. In conclusion, this scenario represents a uniﬁed
cosmological model with one parameter less, and is thus
characterized by a higher predictive power that can in
principle be falsiﬁed.
