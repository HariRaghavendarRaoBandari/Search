A physically-motivated function was developed to accurately determine the total absorption peak
in an electromagnetic calorimeter and to overcome biases present in many commonly used methods.
The function is the convolution of a detector resolution function with the sum of a delta function,
which represents the complete absorption of energy, and a tail function, which describes the partial
absorption of energy and depends on the detector materials and structures. Its performance was
tested with the simulation of three typical cases. The accuracy of the extracted peak value, resolu-
tion, and peak area was improved by an order of magnitude on average, relative to the Crystal Ball
function.

INTRODUCTION

The extraction of useful and physically meaningful parameters from a measured energy spectrum is a long-standing
question in particle and nuclear physics experiments. Electromagnetic (EM) calorimeters have been a cornerstone
of particle physics experiments and today are still irreplaceable as tools for making new discoveries, like at the
Large Hadron Collider [1]. Because of their ﬁnite sizes and the presence of insensitive materials, EM calorimeters
do not faithfully convey the incident energy of a particle in many cases. This fact can be signiﬁcant for experiments
that require relatively high accuracy in absolute energy, like the RENO50 [2], JUNO [3], and Jinping [4] neutrino
experiments.

Several functions are frequently used to ﬁt the spectrum of deposited energy in electromagnetic calorimeters.
The Gaussian function and truncated Gaussian function are very popular in determining the total absorption peak.
Another widely used function originally introduced for this purpose is the Crystal Ball (CB) function [5–7]. The
logarithmic Gaussian and exponentially modiﬁed Gaussian distribution have also been used, for example in Refs. [8–
10]. The total absorption peak extracted using these functions has intrinsic biases.

In this article, a detailed discussion is given with respect to the CB function without loss of generality. The CB
function was developed to describe the energy deposition of electrons or gammas in an array of NaI (Tl) crystals
of the calorimeter of the Crystal Ball experiment. It has been used, for example, to describe EM energy deposition
in the liquid scintillator detectors of the Daya Bay neutrino experiment [11] and the invariant mass of a resonance
with radiative energy loss in the Belle [12] and LHCb [13] experiments. It has become one of the standard functions
supported by popular analysis softwares, for example, RooFit of ROOT [14].

The CB function is piecewise-deﬁned, consisting of a Gaussian peak and a power-law tail. The function can be

expressed as

where µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian peak, n is the exponent of the tail function, α
gives the connecting point of the Gaussian and tail function, and N is a normalization factor. µ and σ are generally
used to study the energy scale and resolution of a calorimeter.

With the high statistics often accumulated in experiments or simulations, we observed a consistently poor χ2 per
number of degrees of freedom (NDF) when ﬁtting with the CB function, and signiﬁcant biases of the extracted means
and resolutions, which will be demonstrated.

2

Theoretically it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd a physical motivation for two piecewise-deﬁned sub-functions. The impact of
the tail to the ﬁtted mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian is indirect and obscure. Furthermore, there is no
apparent representation of the number of totally absorbed events.

In this article, we brieﬂy discuss the energy deposition of photons and electrons in an EM calorimeter and introduce a
physically-motivated EM calorimeter function in section II, present performance studies using Geant4 [15] simulation
for three typical applications of EM calorimeters in section III, discuss additional details of the calorimeter function
in section IV, and conclude in section V.

II. ELECTROMAGNETIC CALORIMETER FUNCTION

The energy measured in an electromagnetic calorimeter is described with the electromagnetic calorimeter function

(calorimeter function for short) fcal:

fcal ≡ fenergy deposited ⊗ fresolution,

(2)

which is a convolution of the deposited energy spectrum and the detector resolution. Detector nonlinearity and
nonuniformity are not directly considered.

Figure 1(a) shows a typical distribution of the energy deposited by monoenergetic gammas or electrons in an EM

calorimeter. The distribution has some noticeable features:

• the peak is a Kronecker delta function corresponding to the complete absorption of the energy;
• the tail to the left corresponds to the partial absorption of energy in the sensitive region of the detector;
• the shape and fraction of the tail depends on the actual detector dimensions, materials, and structure.
Detector energy resolution can often be approximated by a Gaussian function and is generally a function of energy.

Figure 1(b) gives the measured spectrum after a constant-resolution Gaussian smearing.

Figure 1(c) illustrates the contributions of the peak and tail portions after the Gaussian smearing. The smeared
tail spreads into the Gaussian peak from the left, causing the maximum of the spectrum to occur below the true
Gaussian peak energy, and apparently enlarging the Gaussian resolution. Fitting the spectrum without considering
these eﬀects yields intrinsic biases.

Inspired by these observations, Eq. (2) can take a more concrete form:

fcal = (αfpeak + (1 − α)ftail) ⊗ fresolution

= (αδ + (1 − α)ftail) ⊗ Gauss,

(3)

where α is the peak fraction and ftail is the tail distribution, which is determined according to the situation.

Peak: The sharp peak in Fig. 1(a) corresponds to total energy absorption. With a Gaussian detector resolution

where E refers to the measured energy, and µ and σ are the total absorption energy and energy resolution, respectively.
Tail: The shape of the tail depends on the detector. Two analytical expressions are presented for demonstration:

During the study a few more complicated tail shapes were also tested, such as combinations of constant and

fcal = (αδ + βfexp1 + (1 − α − β)fexp2) ⊗ Gauss,

which contains two exponential tails, fexp1 and fexp2, with fractions of β and 1 − α − β, respectively, and

fcal = (αδ + βfexp + (1 − α − β)fconst) ⊗ Gauss,

(9)

(10)

which contains one exponential tail, fexp, and one constant tail, fconst, with fractions of β and 1− α− β, respectively.

In addition, a simple case of energy dependent energy resolution can be found in Appendix A.

III. PERFORMANCE

In this section we examine the performance of the calorimeter function. Three practical cases were studied using
Geant4: uniformly distributed γ’s in a liquid scintillator detector, a calibration source in the center of the scintillator
detector, and γ’s directed into a crystal EM calorimeter.

Three parameters were extracted and studied:

1. peak energy,

2. energy resolution, and

3. peak area,

where peak area represents the number of totally absorbed events. The peak area is not explicitly deﬁned for the CB
function, so the area of its Gaussian (integrated from −∞ to +∞) was used as a proxy. The Accuracy is deﬁned as
the percentage error of the ﬁt result with respect to the true value:

Accuracy ≡(cid:18) ﬁt result − true value

true value

(cid:19) · 100%.

Case 1 : Liquid scintillator detector

(11)

Liquid scintillator (and similarly liquid argon or liquid neon) has been used by numerous neutrino experiments,
It has also been
including the KamLAND [16], Double Chooz [17], RENO [18], and Daya Bay [11] experiments.
selected for use by the forthcoming RENO50 [2], LENA [19], JUNO [3], SNO+ [20], DEAP [21], and Jinping [4]
experiments. The detectors of these experiments are large electromagnetic calorimeters. We simulated a cylindrical
detector of 3 meters in height and 3 meters in diameter, as shown in Fig. 2, which is the scale of the Double Chooz,
RENO, and Daya Bay detectors. We simulated 2.2-MeV γ’s uniformly distributed in the detector. The 2.2-MeV γ
from neutron capture by hydrogen has been used to measure neutrino oscillation and the reactor neutrino spectrum,
in addition to being used for detector calibrations [16, 22–24].

Each 2.2-MeV γ developed an electromagnetic cascade in the detector. The primary γ and its secondary particles in
this cascade sometimes escaped the detector boundary resulting in partial energy absorption. The Compton scattering
spectrum of the 2.2-MeV γ and those of the secondary γ’s pile up as shown in Fig. 3(a). The ≈20-keV gap just below
the peak is due to daughter γ’s that deposited most of their energy and then escaped the detector. The reason
the gap is about 20 keV is because that is the energy around which the interaction cross-section begins to increase
exponentially (see, for example, Ref. [25]). Thus a γ with energy < 20 keV is much less likely to escape the detector.
The deposited energy spectrum was smeared by a constant-resolution Gaussian function of σ/µ = 6% [11]. This
example made use of Eq. (10), which contains two exponential tails. In Fig. 3(b), an improvement in the χ2/NDF can
be seen with respect to the CB function result, which is shown in Fig. 3(c). The details are summarized in Table I.
The Accuracy of the peak energy, energy resolution, and peak area are all improved by an order of magnitude (> 10).

calorimeter function. The bottom plot shows the ﬁtting results with the CB function with two diﬀerent ﬁtting ranges. The ﬁt
errors with the CB function are at the same level as with the calorimeter function.

Case 2 : Calibration source

Calibration sources are essential to make precise measurements using liquid scintillator detectors. For example,
68Ge and 60Co sources have been used to calibrate the energy scale of a detector, or to study its non-linear energy
68Ge decays through positron emission [27] where the positron quickly annihilates and emits two
response [26].
0.511-MeV γ’s. 60Co undergoes β-decay and emits γ’s: over 99% of the time, a 1.17-MeV and 1.33-MeV γ will be

6

observed [27].

A realistic 68Ge calibration source [26] was simulated in the center of the liquid scintillator detector modeled for
the previous section. The source geometry was simpliﬁed as a Teﬂon sphere of 3-cm diameter with a thin 68Ge slab
of 1 cm×1 cm×0.2 cm in its center. The geometry of the setup is shown in Fig. 4.
Figure 5(a) shows the spectrum of energy deposited from the positron source. Energy loss occurred dominantly in
the Teﬂon sphere but also beyond the region of liquid scintillator. The resulting distribution is an overlap of these
two Compton scattering spectra. The most obvious structure is the single 0.511-MeV γ Compton edge at 0.68 MeV.
A 3% detector energy resolution smearing was applied [3].

The ﬁtting results with the calorimeter function given by Eq. (8) and the CB function are shown in Fig. 5(b) and
Fig. 5(c), where the peak energy, energy resolution, and peak area were determined with an overall improvement of
a factor of 10. The comparison details are summarized in Table I.

FIG. 4: Calibration source in the center of a liquid scintillator detector.

Case 3 : CsI crystal array

Last, we simulated an array of CsI crystals as used mostly in large scale particle detectors. Each CsI crystal was a
cuboid of 7 cm×7 cm×32 cm, similar to the size of the BES III [28] electromagnetic calorimeter. 7×7 crystals were
put together with a gap of 0.5 mm between adjacent crystals. Each gap was ﬁlled with Mylar, which is often used as
a wrapping material. The geometry is shown in Fig. 6. 50-MeV γ’s were directed toward the the central crystal.

Figure 7 shows the distribution of deposited energy, where partial energy absorption occurred at every surface of
the calorimeter and the Mylar gaps. The fraction of partial absorption is much large than for the previous two cases
involving the liquid scintillator detector. The most obvious Compton edge is around 49.7 MeV. The detector energy
resolution was 4% [28].

The measured energy distribution was ﬁt with the calorimeter function given by Eq. (10). Because the ﬁrst Compton
edge is very close to the total absorption peak, and has a complicated surrounding structure, the two exponents of the
tail function were predetermined by ﬁtting the unsmeared tail shown in Fig. 7(a). The ﬁt results with the calorimeter
and CB functions are shown in Fig. 7(b) and Fig. 7(c). Signiﬁcant improvements in peak energy, energy resolution,
and peak area were observed (see Table I). Because the fraction of total absorption for this case is much smaller than
for the previous two cases, the extraction of the peak area is worse and would beneﬁt from a more careful construction
of the tail function.

IV. DISCUSSION

A summary of the comparisons for all three cases is given in Table I. The calorimeter function is successful in
extracting the total absorption peak energy, energy resolution, and peak area, with accuracies improved by an order
of magnitude in almost all cases.

The CB function results in a lower peak energy and a larger energy resolution relative to the true values, in all
cases. This is due to the fact that the function does not consider the impact of the tail on the peak. The peak area

in the CB function is not a well-deﬁned quantity, and was grossly overestimated. The fourth column in Table I lists
the results of the CB function using ﬁt ranges that provided the best χ2/NDF. These ﬁts are essentially those of a
truncated Gaussian, which can be seen from panel (c) of Figs. 3, 5, and 7.

The shape and fraction of the tail strongly depend on the structure of the detector as demonstrated in the pre-
vious sections. Single or double exponential tail functions were generally suﬃcient for these applications. However,
additional forms can be explored by studying the energy tail using simulation, which is the suggested approach when
applying the calorimeter function. As an example, the 20-keV gap of Case 1 in Section III may be better accommo-
dated by integrating the tail function from 0 to µ−20 keV (instead of from 0 to µ). A similar modiﬁcation could be
considered for the Compton edge of Case 3 in Section III.
At the same time, the shape and fraction of the tail are key to characterizing the detector structure, for example,

extracted, the calorimeter function can provide a unique perspective using data.

V. CONCLUSION

In this work, we studied energy deposition in an electromagnetic calorimeter. Motivated by observed spectral
features, an electromagnetic calorimeter function was developed. The performance of the function was compared
with the Crystal Ball function using simulation. With a clear physical meaning, the accuracies of the extracted peak
energy and energy resolution are signiﬁcantly improved. The concept of peak area is naturally deﬁned. The shape and
fraction of the tail reﬂect the characteristics of the detector, and are thus informative in understanding a detector. A
similar application to hadronic calorimeters and invariant mass distributions is expected. Further studies are needed.

Appendix A: Including energy resolution

The energy dependence of energy resolution is considered by performing the integration in Eq. (6) under the

assumption that the energy resolution is proportional to the square root of the deposited energy: σ = c√E′.

where erfc(E) ≡ 1 − erf(E) and A ≡ √1 − 2c2λ. Thus, this function is restricted to cases where the shape of the tail

and the resolution satisfy λ < 1

Combining Eqs. (3), (4), and (A1) after normalization, we obtain Eq. (A2) for the complete form of the function:
