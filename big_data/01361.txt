The tunneling junction between one-dimensional topological superconductor and integer (frac-
tional) topological insulator (TI), realized via point contact,
is investigated theoretically with
bosonization technology and renormalization group methods. For the integer TI case, in a ﬁnite
range of edge interaction parameter, there is a non-trivial stable ﬁxed point which corresponds to
the physical picture that the edge of TI breaks up into two sections at the junction, with one side
coupling strongly to the Majorana fermion and exhibiting perfect Andreev reﬂection, while the
other side decouples, exhibiting perfect normal reﬂection at low energies. This ﬁxed point can be
used as a signature of the Majorana fermion and tested by nowadays experiment techniques. For
the fractional TI case, the universal low-energy transport properties are described by perfect nor-
mal reﬂection, perfect Andreev reﬂection, or perfect insulating ﬁxed points dependent on the ﬁlling
fraction and edge interaction parameter of fractional TI.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, the study of topological superconductors
which support Majorana fermion excitations has been
a focus of theoretical and experimental studies in con-
densed matter physics1–3. Majorana fermions being
their own anti-particles have exotic non-Abelian braid-
ing statistics and great potential in the applications of
fault-tolerant topological quantum computation4. There
are many proposals which allow us to engineer topo-
logical superconductor (TSC), based on proximity cou-
pling to s-wave superconductors. These include topo-
insulators5,6, semiconductor quantum wires7,8,
logical
and chains of magnetic adatoms9–13. Among these pro-
posals, the most promising candidate for the experi-
mental realization is the semiconductor quantum wires
proposal1,14. The experimental evidences of Majorana
fermions have been shown in spin-orbit coupled quantum
wire model15–17. All other proposals are being actively
pursued18,19.

Because of these intrinsically fascinating of Majorana
fermions, there are many interesting transport properties
and critical points when TSC couples to other materi-
als20–33. A junction between a TSC and a Fermi lead (or
interacting lead) is predicted to exhibit perfect Andreev
reﬂection at low energies20,23. Further, a novel type of
quantum frustration and quantum critical points appear
at low energies when one-dimensional (1D) TSC couples
to two interacting leads or an interacting lead with two
channels23–25. At this critical point, the perfect Andreev
reﬂection occurs in one interacting lead (one channel)
and perfect normal reﬂection in the other. The tunnel-
ing junction between a TSC with chiral Majorana liquid
at the edge and a helical Luttinger liquid is studied28,
the main conclusion of which is that at low energies, the
helical Luttinger liquids is cut into two separated half
wires by backscattering potential and the tunneling be-

tween the Majorana liquid and the helical Luttinger liq-
uid is forbidden. The perfect Andreev transmission (the
reﬂected hole goes into a diﬀerent lead from where the
electron arrived) can occur when the edge of topological
insulator (TI) contacts with a Kramers pair of Majorana
fermions in TSC33.

Usually, the quantum wires with electron-electron in-
teraction are described by Luttinger liquids theory34,35
and the low-energy physics of the tunneling junctions be-
tween TSC and interacting quantum wires are analyzed
by renormalization group method23–31. These interact-
ing quantum wires are topological trivial systems.
In
contrast, the interplay of the TSC and other topologi-
cal matters may result in novel and interesting transport
properties. Recently, we have studied the point contact
tunneling junction between 1D TSC and single-channel
quantum Hall (QH) liquids36. For the ν = 1 integer
QH liquid, the perfect Andreev reﬂection with quantized
zero-bias tunneling conductance 2e2/h is predicted to oc-
cur at zero temperature and voltage, which is caused
by Majorana fermion tunneling not by the Cooper-pair
tunneling. The quantized conductance can serve as a
deﬁnitive ﬁngerprint of a Majorana fermion. However,
for the Laughlin fractional QH liquid cases, the universal
low-energy transport is governed by the perfect normal
reﬂection ﬁxed point with vanishing zero-bias tunneling
conductance.

The edges states of two-dimensional (2D) integer TI,
known as helical liquid, are topologically protected by
time-reversal symmetry. The localized Majorana modes
emerge at interface of superconductor-ferromagnet junc-
tion on the edge of 2D TI6,37. The diﬀerent geome-
tries of TSC coupling with the edge of 2D TI have been
investigated28,32,33. The fractional TI38–43, which is the
strongly interacting version of 2D TI, can be regarded as
the generalization of the fractional QH liquids to time-
reversal-invariant systems. The simplest case of a frac-

tional TI consists of two decoupled copies of a Laugh-
lin fractional QH states with opposite spin polarizations.
The parafermions (fractionalizing Majorana fermoins)
can be obtained at the interface between a SC and a
ferromagnet along the edge of fractional TI44–47. Due to
these intriguing and exotic properties, it is of both theo-
retical and practical interest to investigate the transport
properties of junction between the TSC and integer (frac-
tional) TI.

The content of the paper is organized as follows. In
Sec.
II, using bosonization technology and renormal-
ization group methods, we ﬁrstly research the tunneling
transport signatures of 1D TSC and integer TI. In a ﬁ-
nite range of edge interaction parameter, the edge of TI
breaks up into two sections at the junction, with one
side having perfect Andreev reﬂection due to Majorana
fermion tunneling, while the other side decouples, hav-
ing perfect normal reﬂection. This physical picture of our
setup can be tested by present experimental techniques.
Next, we calculate the phase diagram of the fractional
TI case. In Sec. III, we make discussions and concluding
remarks.

II. THEORY AND DISCUSSION

In this section, we consider the point contact tunneling
junction of 1D TSC and ﬁlling fraction ν = 1/m (m is
an odd integer) fractional TI, as shown in Fig. 1. When
m = 1, the fractional TI degenerates into 2D topological
insulator. Next, we will use TI to denote the integer and
fractional TI, except where confusion might result from
these abbreviations.

FIG. 1: (Color online) Schematic illustration of the tunnel-
ing junction between TSC and TI. The edge of TI can be
described in terms of two bosonic ﬁelds φα. The 1D TSC is
characterized by the Majorana fermions γ and γ(cid:48).

The 1D TSC is characterized by the two Majorana
fermions γ and γ(cid:48) at end points, which can be obtained
by a spin-orbit coupled quantum wire subjected to a mag-
netic ﬁeld and proximate to an s-wave superconductor7,8.
We assume all the important energy scales are smaller
than the superconducting energy gap and the 1D TSC is
suﬃciently long so that Majorana fermion γ(cid:48) do not cou-
ple to electrons in the TI. The fractional TI we analyze

2

consists of two coupled fractional QH states, in which
electrons of spin up form a Laughlin fractional QH states
with ﬁlling fraction ν↑ = 1/m and electrons of spin down
form a Laughlin fractional QH states with ﬁlling fraction
ν↓ = −1/m. The edge states of the TI are helical Lut-

tinger liquid and the top edge of TI connects leads µ1 and
µ2. Here, we label the right and left sides of junction by
x > 0 and x < 0 respectively, and assume that the two
leads are inﬁnitely far away.

The Hamiltonian of the tunneling junction can be ex-

pressed as

H = H0 + HT

(1)

where H0 is the Hamiltonian of TI edge theory and HT
tunneling Hamiltonian.

Firstly, we discuss the edge theories (helical Luttinger
liquids) of integer TI48,49 and fractional TI39,40,50. Here,
we express these theories within a uniﬁed framework.
When m = 1, these reduce to integer TI case. The edges
of TI can be described by two chiral bosonic quantum
ﬁelds φα and the density operators are

ρα =

where α = R (right-mover with spin up), L (left-mover
with spin down).

tion relations

where K < 1 (K > 1) for repulsive (attractive) edge

be substituted by a simple electron-hole bilayer where
the two layers are in a Laughlin fractional QH states
with ﬁlling fraction ν = ±1/m.

The electron creation operators can be expressed as

Ψ†α (x) = Γαeim(σz)ααφα

(7)

with Γα the Klein factor that is used to ensure the correct
anti-commutation relations between diﬀerent fermion
species and obey the following commutation relations.

Γ†α = Γα,{Γα, Γβ} = 2δαβ,{Γα, γβ} = 0

(8)

From the ﬁrst relation above, we can view Klein fac-
tors as additional Majorana fermions, which is important
for studying related Majorana fermion models as shown
in51,52. The third equation ensure the anti-commutation
relations of electrons Ψα and Majorana fermion γ.

As regards the various couplings at the point contact,
there are three major types of tunneling processes: the
Majorana fermion-induced tunneling, the Cooper pairs
tunneling, and backscattering of electrons in the helical
Luttinger liquid. The tunneling Hamiltonian of our sys-
tem at x = 0 can be expressed as

HT =γ

(cid:104)

(cid:3) + ∆
(cid:105)

+ u

Ψ†RΨL + H.c

(cid:105)

(cid:88)

where the ﬁrst term stands for Majorana fermion cou-
pling to electrons of TI, the second term is the tunneling
of Cooper pairs between TSC and TI. The second term
∆ is the s-save Cooper-pair tunneling induced locally in
the wire by the superconducting pairing23,53, similar to
the tunnel junction between conventional superconduc-
tor and multicomponent fractional QH liquids54,55. The
third term u is the backscattering of electrons in the heli-
cal Luttinger liquid. As shown in Ref. 28, the backscat-
tering of electrons occurs because of the broken time-
reversal symmetry by the TSC. For time-reversal invari-
ant TSC, the electrons backscattering is forbidden33.

After bosonization, the tunneling term becomes

HT =2iγ

tαΓα cos [m (ϕ (0) ± θ (0))] + 2∆ sin [2mθ (0)]

α

+ 2u sin [2mϕ (0)]

(10)

where the upper (lower) sign is for α = R (L). The ﬁrst
tunneling term factorize into Klein-Majorana interaction
and charge sector parts. We can deﬁne ordinary fermion

ψα = (γ + iΓα) /2 with(cid:8)ψα, ψ†α

(cid:9) = 1, so

iγΓα = 2ψ†αψα − 1 = ±1

(11)

and we can see that the values correspond to this energy
level being occupied and empty. Consequently, the Klein-
Majorana fusion procedure can eliminate the Majorana

and fast (f ) modes: ϕs (τ ) = (cid:82) Λ/b
ϕf (τ ) = (cid:82)

We ﬁrst assume tα, ∆ and u are weak perturbation
and study these fate using perturbative renormalization
group (RG) analysis. First, we pass to a Lagrangian
formalism by a Legendre transform of the Hamiltonian
and integrate out the bosonic ﬁelds in the partition func-
tion of the system except at x = 0, then obtain a the-
ory deﬁned only at the location of the point contact.
Next, the bosonic ﬁeld ϕ (θ) are split into slow (s)
2π e−iωτ ϕ(ω) and
2π e−iωτ ϕ(ω), with Λ as an energy
cutoﬀ, b > 1 as a scale factor, and τ = it the Euclidean
time. The θs and θf have a similar deﬁnition. Third, we
integrate over the fast modes and the new eﬀective action
for the slow degrees of freedom can be calculated using
cumulant expansion to the lowest-order approximation.
Last, the eﬀective action is identical in its structure to
the original action hence is renormalizable and the next
step is rescaling.
In a word, the lowest-order ﬂows for
the coupling tα, ∆, and u are

signatures. Then, the fractional TI case is investigated.

each other. For 2 − √

we can see that when 2−√

When m = 1, our system reduces to the 2D integer TI
(quantum spin Hall eﬀect) case. From the Eqs. (12-14),
3, the Majorana
fermion coupling to electrons term becomes relevant. For
K > 1, the Cooper-pair tunneling term becomes relevant.
When K < 1, the electrons backscattering is relevant.
So, when 1 < K < 2 +
3, the Majorana fermion cou-
pling and Cooper-pair tunneling are in competition with
3 < K < 1, the Majorana fermion
coupling and electrons backscattering are in competition
with each other. Thus, the tunneling junction will exhibit
fascinating phase diagrams. According to these RG ﬂows
of Eqs. (12-14), for K >
3, the Cooper-pair tunneling
is the dominant scattering process and the low-energy
transport is controlled by perfect Andreev reﬂection ﬁxed
point with quantized zero-bias conductance 2e2/h. For
K < 1/
3, the electrons backscattering is most relevant
and the system ﬂows to the prefect insulating ﬁxed point
at low energies, analogous to the result of Ref 28. This

√

√

ﬁxed point corresponds to the physics picture where the
backscattering cuts the edge into two halves (denoted
by right R and left L sides) and the conductance be-
tween the leads µ1 and µ2 is zero. We then have two
half-inﬁnite helical Luttinger liquids. Next, we ﬁrst an-
√
alyze the stability of the prefect insulating ﬁxed point
√
for K < 1/
3, and then research the scattering proper-
ties for 1/
3, where the Majorana fermions
3 < K <
coupling is most relevant.

√

√

For convenience, we regard the left and right edge
parts of 2D TI at x = 0 as the leads Lµ and Rµ. To
investigate the stability of the prefect insulating ﬁxed
point for K < 1/
3, we consider the possible perturba-
tions around it. Now, our system is similar to 1D TSC
coupling to two interacting leads or one lead with two
channels23,24,28, while the diﬀerences from our system are
that the two leads are the edges of 2D TI and have the
same Luttinger interaction parameter K. So, we can use
these part conclusion for our setup. Physically, the devi-
ations from this ﬁxed point mean that the single electron
transmission between left and right sides at x = 0 is al-
lowed. There are other possible perturbation around it
such as Majorana fermion tunneling tβ term and Cooper-
pair tunneling ∆β. The single electron transmission λ
can be expressed as

Hλ = λ(cid:0)Ψ†(cid:0)0+(cid:1) Ψ(cid:0)0−(cid:1) + H.c(cid:1)

(15)

Based on the above RG analysis, we can derive the the
scaling dimensions of tβ, ∆β, and λ, yielding D (tβ) =
1/ (2K), D (∆β) = 2/K, and D (λ) = 1/K. So, the
Cooper-pair tunneling and single electron transmission
√
are irrelevant. However, the Majorana fermion tunnel-
ing is relevant for 1/2 < K < 1/
3 and destabilize the
prefect insulating ﬁxed point. We naively might conclude
that the Majorana fermion is simultaneously and strongly
coupling with the two sides under renormalization and
the low-energy transport is controlled by perfect Andreev
reﬂection ﬁxed points in the two sides (label A ⊗ A).
However, this A ⊗ A ﬁxed point is unstable, as shown in
Ref 24. First, the A ⊗ A quantum critical point occurs
only when t1 and t2 exactly balance. But, the Majorana
fermion has a spin structure56,57. Generally, Majorana
fermion γ couples with one side stronger than the other.
Second, using the ‘-expansion’ techniques24, we can de-
rive that the bigger tunneling tβ grows under renormal-
ization and the smaller ﬂow to zero. So, the system ﬂows
to A ⊗ N or N ⊗ A ﬁxed points which corresponding to
perfect Andreev reﬂection with quantized zero-bias tun-
neling conductance 2e2/h in one side and perfect normal
reﬂection with vanishing zero-bias tunneling conductance
in the other. Here, we discuss the stability of the A ⊗ N
or N ⊗ A ﬁxed points. For simplicity, we assume the sys-
tem ﬂows to A ⊗ N ﬁxed point where perfect Andreev
reﬂection occurs in left side and perfect normal reﬂection
takes place in the right side. The possible perturbations
around this ﬁxed point are that the electrons backscatter-
ing Ψ†R (0−) ΨL (0−)+H.c in left side with scaling dimen-
sion 2K, Cooper-pair tunneling Ψ†R (0+) Ψ†L (0+) + H.c

4

√

3 < K <

√

in right side with scaling dimension 2/K, and electrons
transmission Ψ† (0+) Ψ (0−) + H.c between the two sides
with scaling dimension (K + 1/K)/2. All these pertur-
bations are irrelevant. Thus, for 1/2 < K < 1/
3, the
low-energy physics is described by A⊗ N or N ⊗ A ﬁxed
points where the edge of TI breaks up into two sections
at the junction, with one side coupling strongly to the
Majorana mode and exhibiting perfect Andreev reﬂec-
tion, while the other side decouples, exhibiting perfect
normal reﬂection. In addition, for K < 1/2, the prefect
insulating ﬁxed point is stable.

√
Next, we analyze the scattering processes for the region
of 1/
3. Now, the Majorana fermions cou-
pling is the leading relevant operator. Under renormal-
ization, the Majorana fermion couples more strongly with
the two right and left movers (chiral bosonic ﬁelds φα).
This might indicate the system ﬂows toward A⊗ A ﬁxed
point. As discussed above, this A ⊗ A ﬁxed point is also
unstable. The reason is that the critical point A⊗A needs
PT (parity ⊗ time reversal) symmetry protecting, while
the electrons backscattering Ψ†RΨL + H.c. term breaks
time reversal symmetry, as shown in the Appendix F in
Ref 24. By way of the ‘-expansion’ techniques, we found
that the system ﬂows to A ⊗ N or N ⊗ A ﬁxed points
which corresponding to perfect Andreev reﬂection in one
mover and perfect normal reﬂection in the other. Accord-
ing to the perfect Andreev reﬂection boundary condition
Ψ†R (0±) = −ΨL (0±), the edge of TI breaks up into two
sections at the junction, with one side coupling strongly
to the Majorana mode and exhibiting perfect Andreev
reﬂection, while the other side decouples, exhibiting per-
√
fect normal reﬂection. This result is the same as the case
3. So, the A ⊗ N or
√
for the region of 1/2 < K < 1/
N ⊗ A ﬁxed points are stable for 1/
3. In
summary, we can derive the phase diagram of the integer
TI case, as shown in table I. The low-energy physics is
governed by the perfect Andreev reﬂection ﬁxed point for
3 with Cooper-pair tunneling, A ⊗ N or N ⊗ A

In what follows, we calculate the low energy physi-
cal observable conductance of our setup for K < 1 with
physical interest. For convenience, the TSC, leads Lµ
and Rµ (the left and right sides for the edge of TI) are
labelled as 0, 1, and 2. For the K < 1/2, the leading irrel-
evant scattering processes are electron transmission and
Majorana fermion tunneling. The tunneling conductance
G between TSC and TI, and conductance G12 between

leads Lµ and Rµ to the lowest-order approximation in
inﬁnitesimal voltage V or temperature T are
G (V ) ∼ V 1/K−2, G (T ) ∼ T 1/K−2,
G12(V ) ∼ V 2/K−2, G12 (T ) ∼ T 2/K−2.

(16)

(17)

For the 1/2 < K < 1, we assume ﬁrst that the system
ﬂows toward A⊗N ﬁxed point and then calculate the dif-
ferential conductance. The results for N ⊗ A ﬁxed point
are straightforward. Now, the perfect Andreev reﬂection
occurs at the left side and perfect normal reﬂection oc-
curs at the right side. The conductance G01 between
TSC and lead Lµ, conductance G02 between TSC and
lead Rµ, and conductance G12 between leads Lµ and Rµ
in bias voltage V are

(20)

where cV is a non-universal constant. The low tem-
perature dependences of these conductance have similar
power-law scaling behaviors.

When the 1D TSC is in topological trivial phase and
Majorana fermion tunneling is absent, the tunneling con-
ductance between TSC and 2D TI, and conductance G12
between leads Lµ and Rµ for K < 1 are

G (V ) ∼ V 4/K−2, G (T ) ∼ T 4/K−2
G12 (V ) ∼ V 2/K−2, G12 (T ) ∼ T 2/K−2

(21)

(22)

where the Cooper-pair tunneling and electrons transmis-
sion terms are the leading irrelevant operators.

Finally, we discuss the experimental measurements for
our setup. The experimental evidences of TSC have
been shown in InSb quantum wire15–17. On the other
hand, the 2D TI has been observed in HgTe/CdTe58
and InAs/GaSb59 quantum wells. Here, we take the
HgTe/CdTe for example.
It is rather nontrivial to es-
timate the experimentally edge interaction parameter K
of 2D TI. As calculated in Refs. 60 and 61, the value
of interaction parameter for HgTe/CdTe quantum well is
0.5 < K < 0.55. So, in the case of HgTe/CdTe quantum
well, the low-energy physics is determined by the non-
trival stable A ⊗ N or N ⊗ A ﬁxed points. The diﬀerent
bias voltage dependences in Eqs.
(18-22) can identify
whether the TSC is nontrivial or not. So, the quantized
conductance and diﬀerent power-law scaling behaviors in
Eqs. (18-20) can be used as a signature for the Majorana
fermion in 1D TSC. For the InAs/GaSb62 quantum well,
the Fermi velocity of the edge modes can be controlled
by gates and Luttinger interacting parameter can be ﬁne
tuned, we can use the InAs/GaSb quantum well to test
the phase diagram of integer TI coupling to 1D TSC as
a function of the Luttinger interacting parameter.

B. Fractional topological insulator case

From the Eqs. (12-14), we can see that for all odd in-
teger m > 1, the tunneling term t of Majorana fermion
coupling to electrons is irrelevant. When K > m, the
Cooper-pair tunneling term ∆ is relevant and the low-
energy transport is controlled by perfect Andreev reﬂec-
tion ﬁxed point with quantized zero-bias conductance
2e2/h. When 1/m < K < m, the low-energy physics
is governed by the perfect normal reﬂection ﬁxed point
with a vanishing zero-bias tunneling conductance. For
K < 1/m, the electrons backscattering is relevant and
the system ﬂows to the prefect insulating ﬁxed point at
low energies. This ﬁxed point corresponds to the physics
picture where the backscattering cuts the edge into two
halves and the conductance between the leads µ1 and µ2
is zero.

Now we analyze the stability of the prefect insulating
ﬁxed point. There are three types of scattering processes
that might destabilize the ﬁxed point: Majorana fermion
tunneling, Cooper-pair tunneling, and the quasiparticles
ψR/L,α (x) = (cid:122)αeiφα(x)((cid:122)α is the Klein factor) transmis-
sion. The same RG analysis also applies to this prefect
insulating ﬁxed point. The scaling dimensions of quasi-
particles transmission, Majorana fermion coupling, and
Cooper-pair tunneling are given by 1/(mK), m/(2K),
and 2m/K. We can see that for K < 1/m, these three
processes are all irrelevant and this ﬁxed point is sta-
ble for strong repulsive interaction. Next, we calculate
the corrections to the tunneling conductance G and two-
terminal conductance G12 between leads Lµ and Rµ due
to ﬁnite bias voltage or temperature. The scaling behav-
iors of the tunneling conductance G and two-terminal
conductance G12 to the lowest-order approximation are

G (V ) ∼ V m/K−2, G (T ) ∼ T m/K−2
G12(V ) ∼ V 2/mK−2, G12 (T ) ∼ T 2/mK−2

(23)

(24)
√

√

In the perfect normal reﬂection regime, when

3 <
K < m, the leading irrelevant operator around this point
is Cooper-pair tunneling term ∆. The tunneling conduc-
tance G at bias voltage V (low temperature T ) has the
power-law form

G (V ) ∼ V 2m/K−2, G (T ) ∼ T 2m/K−2

and when 1/m < K <
3, the leading irrelevant opera-
tor is Majorana fermion tunneling term and the tunneling
conductance G is given by
G (V ) ∼ V m(K+1/K)/2−2, G (T ) ∼ T m(K+1/K)/2−2 (26)

The Majorana fermion-induced tunneling is irrelevant
which can be rooted in strong repulsive interaction of
fractional TI. The quasiparticles of fractional TI have
fractional charge and obey fractional exchange statistics
which are forbidden for tunneling. In a word, the univer-
sal low-energy transport properties is described by per-
fect Andreev reﬂection ﬁxed point for K > m, perfect

normal reﬂection ﬁxed point for 1/m < K < m, perfect
insulating ﬁxed point for K < 1/m. When the 1D TSC is
trivial, we can derive the same phase diagram. But, the
tunneling conductance has diﬀerent power-law behaviors
when the bias voltage or temperature is nonzero. The
power-law form of tunneling conductance G for perfect
insulating regime (K < 1/m) is

G (V ) ∼ V 4m/K−2, G (T ) ∼ T 4m/K−2

(27)

In the perfect normal reﬂection regime (1/m < K <

m), the tunneling conductance G is

G (V ) ∼ V 2m/K−2, G (T ) ∼ T 2m/K−2

lator, according to the strength of edge interaction pa-
rameter, there is a non-trivial stable ﬁxed point that the
edge is cut into two halves, the perfect normal reﬂection
occurs in one side, and perfect Andreev reﬂection occurs
in the other side. We can use the InSb quantum wire and
HgTe/CdTe quantum well to test this non-trivial stable
ﬁxed point, which can be used to identify the Majorana
fermion in 1D TSC. For the fractional TI case, the uni-
versal low-energy transport properties are described by
perfect normal reﬂection, perfect insulating, or perfect
Andreev reﬂection ﬁxed points dependent on the ﬁlling
fraction and edge interaction parameter of fractional TI.
From the above results, we found that there are diﬀer-
ent ﬁxed points for the diﬀerent topological matters cou-
pling to TSC. When other strongly correlated topological
matters couple with TSC, the exotic electron tunneling
transport properties and critical points maybe occur.

In this paper, we have studied the point contact tun-
neling junction between 1D TSC and integer (fractional)
TI with bosonization and renormalization group meth-
ods. For the junction of 1D TSC and topological insu-
