GROWTH BEHAVIOUR OF PERIODIC TAME FRIEZES

KARIN BAUR, KLEMENS FELLNER, MARK J. PARSONS, MANUELA TSCHABOLD

Abstract. We examine the growth behaviour of the entries occurring in (the
lattice of) an n-periodic tame frieze F of real numbers. We begin by observing that
the diﬀerence between vertically adjacent entries in (non-trivial) rows n ´ 2 and
n is constant. Entries separated by intervals of n positions in any given diagonal
are then shown to be recursively related, with this constant value appearing as a
coeﬃcient in the linear recursion relation. For this reason, we term it a growth
coeﬃcient for F . Since n can be any multiple of the minimal period of F , this
is one of a family of such coeﬃcients, which are in-turn also recursively related.
Analysis of this latter recursion plays an important role in our investigations.

We place special emphasis on periodic tame friezes of positive integers, spec-
ifying the values the growth coeﬃcients take for any such frieze. We establish
that the growth coeﬃcients of the pair of friezes arising from a triangulation of
an annulus can be considered to coincide. The entries of both are shown to grow
asymptotically exponentially, while triangulations of a punctured disc are seen to
provide the only friezes of linear growth.

1. Introduction

Frieze patterns of numbers were ﬁrst introduced by Coxeter in the early 1970’s
([6]). In recent years, various generalisations in diﬀerent contexts have been studied,
for example in [2, 3, 7, 8, 10], to mention just a few. An excellent overview can be
found in the expository article [9], by Morier-Genoud.

we have mi,jmi`1,j`1 ´ mi,j`1mi`1,j “ 1. The ﬁrst non-trivial row of a frieze F ,
which we denote paiqiPZ with ai “ mi,i for all i, is referred to as the quiddity row
of the frieze. Such a frieze is called periodic if it is invariant under a horizontal
translation. In this case, we refer to any ﬁnite subsequence of consecutive terms of
its quiddity row which generates this row as a quiddity sequence for F .

The frieze F is said to be ﬁnite if it consists of ﬁnitely many rows, ending with
a row of 1’s followed by a row of 0’s. Otherwise, F is said to be inﬁnite. If all the
entries of F are positive integers, apart from those appearing in the initial row (and
also the ﬁnal row in the case of a ﬁnite frieze) of zeros, then it is said to be a frieze
of positive integers. Finite friezes of positive integers ﬁrst appeared in the article [6]
of Coxeter, who then studied them further, together with Conway, in [4, 5]. They
observed that such a ﬁnite frieze is invariant under a glide reﬂection, and hence
periodic.

In general, the positive integer condition on entries is too restrictive for our pur-
poses, and can be replaced by tameness: We refer to F as tame (using the termi-
nology introduced in [2] for SLk-tilings) if any 3 ˆ 3-matrix

formed by successive diagonals has determinant 0. Any frieze whose non-trivial
entries are all non-zero is tame. In particular, this includes all friezes of positive
integers. The quiddity row of a tame frieze is periodic if and only if the frieze
itself is: Note that the forward implication follows since the quiddity row of a tame
frieze determines the frieze, while the reverse implication is trivial. Throughout this
article, our friezes are always assumed to be tame and periodic (these properties are
often tacitly assumed).

Recall that, by [4, 5], ﬁnite friezes of positive integers correspond to triangulations
of (convex) polygons: Given such a frieze, the sequence whose entries are the num-
bers of triangles incident with each vertex of the corresponding triangulation (with
vertices taken in anti-clockwise order around the polygon) is a quiddity sequence
for that frieze. In [1], building upon [12], we gave an analogous characterisation of
periodic inﬁnite friezes of positive integers. Namely, that every triangulation of a
(once-) punctured disc with marked points on the boundary or of an annulus with
marked points on both boundary components gives rise to a periodic inﬁnite frieze
of positive integers (via a quiddity sequence), and every such frieze arises in this
way. More precisely, given such a triangulation the entries in an associated quiddity
sequence are the numbers of regions incident (in a small neighbourhood) with each
vertex on a given boundary component.

Figure 1.1. A lattice of a ﬁnite frieze.

In this article, we examine the growth behaviour of the entries occurring in a
periodic tame frieze. We place special emphasis on ﬁnite and inﬁnite friezes of
positive integers.

The study of the growth behaviour of periodic friezes was initiated by the fourth
author, in [12]. She showed that each diagonal of a periodic inﬁnite frieze, with
minimal period n, arising from a triangulation of a punctured disc is made up of a
collection of n arithmetic sequences, with successive terms separated by n positions.
Since an entry of an arithmetic sequence is given by the diﬀerence of twice the
previous entry and the entry preceding that, we immediately deduce a recursive
relationship (with coeﬃcient 2) between the entries in a diagonal, see Section 2 for
details.

One of our main results is to show that this idea can be extended to arbitrary
periodic tame friezes. For this, it is natural to extend each such frieze to a “uni-
modular lattice” in the plane. In particular, this allows us to also give a meaningful
interpretation of our results for ﬁnite friezes.

Given an inﬁnite frieze F “ pmi,jqj´iě´2, we reﬂect the entries across the row of
zeros while also negating them: For j ´ i ă ´2 we set mi,j “ ´mj`2,i´2. For ﬁnite
friezes, we iteratively perform this anti-symmetric mirroring across the rows of zeros
in a similar manner, see Figure 1.1; in [2], this extension has been referred to as the
skew-periodic extension of the ﬁnite frieze. In both cases, we denote the resulting
lattice in the plane by L “ pmi,jqi,jPZ. It is easy to check that the lattice L of a
(tame) frieze F is also tame in the same sense as for friezes.
The noted recursive relationship holds throughout each diagonal of the lattice of
an inﬁnite frieze arising from a triangulation of a punctured disc. We refer to the
coeﬃcient appearing in the recursion as the principal growth coeﬃcient of the frieze
(and its lattice). For the lattice of an inﬁnite frieze arising only from triangulations

4

K. BAUR, K. FELLNER, M. J. PARSONS, M. TSCHABOLD

of annuli, the principal growth coeﬃcient is greater than 2 (Corollary 3.8). The
principal growth coeﬃcient of the lattice of a ﬁnite frieze of positive integers must
belong to t´2, 0, 1u (Proposition 4.1).
Surprisingly, the principal growth coeﬃcient of a periodic frieze with minimal
period n can be read-oﬀ directly from the frieze (and its lattice), as the (constant)
diﬀerence between entries lying directly above/below one-another in the non-trivial
rows n and n ´ 2 (Theorems 2.2 and 2.5).
By considering a periodic frieze with minimal period n as kn-periodic for k P N, we
obtain a family of growth coeﬃcients for the frieze (and its lattice), all of which can
again be read-oﬀ directly from the lattice. These growth coeﬃcients turn out to be
equal to 2 for inﬁnite friezes arising from triangulations of a punctured disc (Proposi-
tion 4.4). For an inﬁnite frieze arising only from triangulations of annuli, the family
of growth coeﬃcients forms a strictly increasing monotone sequence (Lemma 4.3
together with Corollary 4.5). On the other hand, the family of growth coeﬃcients
of a ﬁnite frieze of positive integers forms a periodic sequence (Corollary 4.2). For
any periodic tame frieze, we also deﬁne a zeroth growth coeﬃcient, which we take
to be 2 and can also be read-oﬀ from the associated lattice.

A triangulation of an annulus An,m (n, m ą 0) in fact gives rise to two periodic
inﬁnite friezes: one from the outer boundary and one from the inner boundary.
It is natural to expect that there is a strong relationship between these friezes.
We show that they can be considered to have the same growth coeﬃcients, when
treating the former as n-periodic and the latter as m-periodic (Theorem 3.4). An
important idea used in the proof of this result is that the growth coeﬃcient of
a periodic inﬁnite frieze can be considered to be invariant under “cutting” and
“gluing” operations (Theorem 3.1), which respectively correspond to removing or
adding a peripheral triangle (that is, removing a triangle formed by three successive
points on a boundary, or gluing a triangle to a boundary segment on a boundary)
in any associated triangulation.

The recursive relationship between entries in a diagonal of a periodic tame frieze
induces a recursive relationship between the diﬀerent growth coeﬃcients of that
frieze (Proposition 2.10). In Section 4, as well as establishing the aforementioned
results on the family of growth coeﬃcients of a periodic frieze of positive integers,
we also study the growth behaviour of such a frieze in terms of the recursively
related growth coeﬃcients. While an inﬁnite frieze arising from a triangulation of
a punctured disc can of course be considered to have linear growth, one arising
from an annulus grows asymptotically exponentially as a result of the larger growth
coeﬃcients (Theorem 4.6 and Proposition 4.7).

The proofs of the results of Section 4 are partly based on the results of Section 5,
which contains a more general analysis of the recursion deﬁning the sequences of
growth coeﬃcients. While Proposition 5.1 classiﬁes conditions under which gener-
alised recursion sequences grow linearly or asymptotically exponentially, Proposi-
tion 5.9 studies periodic solutions. The proof of the latter is built on Theorem 5.2,
which provides generalised multi-stage recursion formulas.

GROWTH BEHAVIOUR OF PERIODIC TAME FRIEZES

2. Growth coefficients of periodic friezes

We consider a lattice L “ pmi,jqi,j in the plane obtained from the (inﬁnite or ﬁnite)
frieze F “ pmi,jqi,j with quiddity row paiqi, where ai “ mi,i for all i P Z. Recall that
F , and hence also L, are always assumed to be periodic and tame. Let us point out
that for inﬁnite friezes, F is the sublattice of L formed by the mi,j with j ´ i ě ´2.
For ﬁnite friezes, the sublattice of L formed by the mi,j with j ´ i ě ´2 consists of
inﬁnitely many copies of the ﬁnite frieze, mirrored “downwards”, with signs reversed
as appropriate. When working with lattices obtained from ﬁnite friezes, we will often
tacitly work in the sublattice of L formed by the mi,j with j ´ i ě ´2.
j ` 1,

We have the following three frieze properties in L, for all i ď j and every i ď k ď

mi,j “ ajmi,j´1 ´ mi,j´2,

and mi,j “ aimi`1,j ´ mi`2,j,

mi,j “ mi,k´1mk,j ´ mi,k´2mk`1,j.

In the ﬁnite case, (1) and (2) already appeared in [6]. For tame lattices, (2) is given
by Equation (5) of [2], with (1) following as a trivial consequence. Using (2), the
proof of (3) given in [1] (for ﬁnite and inﬁnite friezes of positive integers) extends
readily to our setting. We note that (2) is a linear diﬀerence equation which is
sometimes called a discrete Hill equation ([10]).

Our aim is to consider the growth behaviour of the entries within a diagonal
of a (periodic tame) frieze and the associated lattice. In diagonals of friezes aris-
ing from triangulations of punctured discs, see [12], arithmetic sequences of non-
negative integers appear, providing linear growth in our setting. In particular, due
to [12, Proposition 3.11], given such a frieze F “ pmi,jqi,j of period n, then for
any entry mi,j there exists a positive integer d, depending on i and j, such that
mi,j`kn “ mi,j ` kd for all k P Zě0. In other words, if we ﬁx the i-th South-East
diagonal in F and choose some arbitrary j P ti ´ 2, i ´ 1, . . . , i ` n ´ 3u, we get
an arithmetic sequence pmi,j`knqkě0. This actually gives the following recursion for-
mula mi,j`pk`2qn “ 2mi,j`pk`1qn ´ mi,j`kn. Moreover, this recursion still holds if we
replace n with any multiple of n.
This is not true in general for periodic friezes. For instance, for periodic inﬁnite
friezes of positive integers not arising from triangulations of punctured discs, we
will see that a similar recursion holds with a coeﬃcient strictly greater than 2. As
motivation, we consider the special case of one-periodic friezes.
Example 2.1. Let F “ pmi,jqi,j be a one-periodic frieze with quiddity sequence paq,
where a P R and L “ pmi,jqi,j its associated lattice. By (2), we have the following

6

K. BAUR, K. FELLNER, M. J. PARSONS, M. TSCHABOLD

recursion formula for a sequence of three consecutive entries in an SE-diagonal of L:

mi,j`2 “ ami,j`1 ´ mi,j

for all i, j P Z. In case a is an integer strictly greater than 2, we note that the given
quiddity sequence arises from a triangulation of an annulus, but not of a punctured
disc (refer to [1, Corollary 4.5]).

The next theorem tells us that the diﬀerence between the non-trivial rows n and

pn ´ 2q in an n-periodic frieze (and hence also its lattice) is constant.
Theorem 2.2. Let L “ pmi,jqi,j be the lattice of an n-periodic tame frieze F . Then

m1,n ´ m2,n´1 “ mk`1,k`n ´ mk`2,k`n´1

for all k P Z.
Proof. Let pa1, a2, . . . , anq be the quiddity sequence of F . By (2), we have m1n “
a1m2,n´m3,n and m2,n`1 “ a1m2,n´m2,n´1, where in the latter relation we used that
a1 “ an`1. It follows immediately that m1,n ´ m2,n´1 “ a1m2,n ´ m3,n ´ pa1m2,n ´
m2,n`1q “ m2,n`1 ´ m3,n. All other equalities may be established similarly.

(cid:3)

If we choose n to be minimal in Theorem 2.2, we get a family of invariants for the
frieze. Hence it makes sense to abbreviate them by introducing the following notion
of growth coeﬃcients.
Deﬁnition 2.3. Let F “ pmi,jqi,j be a periodic tame frieze with minimal period n
and let L be its lattice. For k ě 0, the kth growth coeﬃcient for F (and for L) is
given by s0 :“ 2 and sk :“ m1,kn ´ m2,kn´1, otherwise. In particular, we say that s1
is the principal growth coeﬃcient for F (and for L).

Remark 2.4. For a one-periodic inﬁnite frieze, the principal growth coeﬃcient s1
coincides with the single entry a in the quiddity sequence, see Example 2.1. A
more general example illustrating the growth coeﬃcients is given in Figure 2.1. An
immediate consequence of (1) is that each growth coeﬃcient is a diﬀerence of two
determinants.

For the upcoming results to hold, it is not required for n to be the minimal period
of the frieze. Therefore, we will often use a more relaxed notion by assigning growth
coeﬃcients to quiddity sequences: Given a frieze F “ pmi,jqi,j with lattice L and
quiddity sequence q, we deﬁne sq :“ m1,n ´ m2,n´1, where n is the length of q. In
particular, if n is minimal (that is, if n is the minimal period of F ), we have sq “ s1.
One of our main results is the following theorem giving a linear recursion formula
for the entries in a diagonal of the lattice associated to a frieze depending on a
growth coeﬃcient. It motivates our use of the terminology “growth coeﬃcient”.
Theorem 2.5. Let L “ pmi,jqi,j be the lattice of an n-periodic tame frieze F with
quiddity sequence q of length n. Then for all i, j, we have

piq mi,j`2n “ sqmi,j`n ´ mi,j,
piiq mi´2n,j “ sqmi´n,j ´ mi,j.

GROWTH BEHAVIOUR OF PERIODIC TAME FRIEZES

Proof. We initially consider piq. Without loss of generality, we will establish the
claim for the diagonal with i “ 1. This entails showing that m1,j`2n “ pm1,n ´
m2,n´1qm1,j`n ´ m1,j for all j.
We ﬁrst deal with the case j ě ´1, using induction on j. We require two initial
cases.
Let j “ ´1. Since m1,´1 “ 0, we aim to show m1,2n´1 “ pm1,n ´ m2,n´1qm1,n´1.
Taking i “ 1, j “ 2n ´ 1, k “ n in (3) and using periodicity, we obtain m1,2n´1 “
m1,n´1mn,2n´1 ´ m1,n´2mn`1,2n´1 “ pmn,2n´1 ´ m1,n´2qm1,n´1. By Theorem 2.2, the
latter is equal to pm1,n ´ m2,n´1qm1,n´1 as required.
Suppose j “ 0. Since m1,0 “ 1, it is enough to show that m1,2n “ pm1,n ´
m2,n´1qm1,n ´ 1. As above we make use of (3), taking i “ 1, j “ 2n, k “ n ` 1,
to obtain m1,2n “ m1,nmn`1,2n ´ m1,n´1mn`2,2n “ m2
1,n ´ m1,n´1m2,n, where the
latter follows by periodicity. But by the unimodular rule, we have m1,n´1m2,n “
m1,nm2,n´1 ` 1, so m1,2n “ m2
1,n ´ m1,nm2,n´1 ´ 1 “ pm1,n ´ m2,n´1qm1,n ´ 1 as
desired.
Our induction hypothesis is that m1,j`2n´1 “ pm1,n´m2,n´1qm1,j`n´1´m1,j´1 and
m1,j`2n “ pm1,n ´ m2,n´1qm1,j`n ´ m1,j. We will establish that m1,j`2n`1 “ pm1,n ´
m2,n´1qm1,j`n`1 ´ m1,j`1. By (2) and periodicity, we have m1,j`n`1 “ aj`1m1,j`n ´
m1,j`n´1 and m1,j`1 “ aj`1m1,j ´ m1,j´1. Using these two relations together with
the induction hypothesis, we obtain pm1,n ´ m2,n´1qm1,j`n`1 ´ m1,j`1 “ pm1,n ´
m2,n´1qpaj`1m1,j`n´ m1,j`n´1q´paj`1m1,j ´ m1,j´1q “ aj`1ppm1,n´ m2,n´1qm1,n`j ´
m1,jq ´ ppm1,n ´ m2,n´1qm1,n`j´1 ´ m1,j´1q “ aj`1m1,2n`j ´ m1,2n`j´1 “ m1,2n`j`1
as required, where the latter follows again by (2) and periodicity.
It follows that piq holds in the sublattice L` for which j ´ i ě ´2. (That is, the
sublattice bounded above by the central row of zeros pmi,i´2qiPZ.) Likewise, piiq also
holds in L`. Using a “mirroring” argument, it follows easily that piq also holds in the
sublattice L´ where j ´ i ď ´2: Consider the diagonal with i “ 1, for j ď ´1 ´ 2n
(so that j ` 2n ď ´1). We have sqm1,j`n ´ m1,j “ ´psqmj`n`2,´1 ´ mj`2,´1q “
´mj`2n`2,´1 “ m1,j`2n. Likewise, piiq also holds in L´.
In order to establish piq for the whole lattice, it remains to deal with the cases
for which m1,j, m1,j`n and m1,j`2n don’t all lie in the same sublattice L` or L´.
Suppose ﬁrst that m1,j lies in L´zL`, while m1,j`n and m1,j`2n lie in L`, so that
´1 ´ n ď j ă ´1 (that is, n ´ 1 ď j ` 2n ă 2n ´ 1). In this case, we use strong
induction on j to establish

m1,j`2n “ sqm1,j`n ´ m1,j.

(4)

Our ﬁrst initial case, j “ ´1´n, is checked by noting that m1,n´1 “ sq¨0`m1,n´1 “
sqm1,´1 ` m1´n,´1 “ sqm1,´1 ` m1,´1´n. And our second initial case, j “ ´n, is
checked by noting that m1,n “ pm1,n ´ m2,n´1q ¨ 1 ` m2,n´1 “ pm1,n ´ m2,n´1q ¨ 1 `
m´n`2,´1 “ sqm1,0 ´ m1,´n.

8

K. BAUR, K. FELLNER, M. J. PARSONS, M. TSCHABOLD

Now, suppose that 1 ´ n ď j ă ´1 and that (4) holds for j ´ 1 and j ´ 2. Using

this together with (2), we have

m1,j`2n “ aj`2nm1,j`2n´1 ´ m1,j`2n´2

“ aj`2npsqm1,j`n´1 ´ m1,j´1q ´ psqm1,j`n´2 ´ m1,j´2q
“ sqpaj`2nm1,j`n´1 ´ m1,j`n´2q ´ paj`2nm1,j´1 ´ m1,j´2q
“ sqpaj`2nm1,j`n´1 ´ m1,j`n´2q ´ pajm1,j´1 ´ m1,j´2q
“ sqm1,j`n ´ m1,j.

It remains to consider the case where m1,j and m1,j`n lie in L´ and m1,j`2n
lies in L`zL´. That is, the case where ´1 ´ 2n ă j ď ´1 ´ n (so that ´1 ă
j ` 2n ď n ´ 1). For such j, using the SW-diagonal analogue of the above
argument, we have mj`n`2,n´1 “ sqmj`2n`2,n´1 ´ mj`3n`2,n´1. Therefore, since
m1,j`2n “ ´mj`2n`2,´1 “ ´mj`3n`2,n´1, we see that m1,j`2n “ sqp´mj`2n`2,n´1q ´
p´mj`n`2,n´1q “ sqmn`1,j`2n ´ mn`1,j`n “ sqm1,j`n ´ m1,j as required.

The proof of piiq can be completed using analogous arguments.
We state Theorem 2.5 for the special case where the period is minimal as a

(cid:3)

corollary.
Corollary 2.6. Given the lattice L “ pmi,jqi,j of a periodic tame frieze F with
minimal period n, we have

mi,j`2kn “ skmi,j`kn ´ mi,j, and mi´2kn,j “ skmi´kn,j ´ mi,j

for all k ě 0.
Remark 2.7. It is immediate that all of the growth coeﬃcients of an inﬁnite frieze
arising from a triangulation of a punctured disc are equal to 2.

We illustrate Theorem 2.5 and Corollary 2.6 with an example.

Example 2.8. Let us consider the frieze in Figure 2.1. The minimal period of the
frieze is 3, and its ﬁrst four growth coeﬃcients are given by s0 “ 2, s1 “ 3, s2 “ 7
and s3 “ 18. In particular, the quiddity sequence q “ p1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 6q, or indeed any
quiddity sequence of length 6, gives rise to the growth coeﬃcient sq “ s2 “ 7. The
sequences of entries highlighted in green and red are recursively related by s1 and
sq “ s2 respectively.
Remark 2.9. Let L “ pmi,jqi,j be the lattice of a given n-periodic tame frieze F
with quiddity sequence q of length n. Since the entries of a diagonal separated by n
positions are recursively related as in Theorem 2.5, then so are linear expressions in
entries separated by n positions. That is, for ik, jk P Z and λk P R, for N P N and
1 ď k ď N, we have

λkmik,jk`2n “ sq˜ Nÿk“1

Nÿk“1

λkmik,jk`n¸ ´

Nÿk“1

λkmik ,jk.

The analogous statement for the South-West diagonals also holds.

Figure 2.1. Growth coeﬃcients (and the associated recursions) in
the lattice of a periodic inﬁnite frieze.

It follows that the (arithmetic) row-means arising from a fundamental domain (of
width n, or equivalently, any positive integer multiple of n) for F are also recursively
related via sq. This further motivates our approach to understanding the growth
behaviour of periodic tame friezes.

The next result, which will play an important role in further analysing the growth
behaviour of the entries of a frieze (and its lattice), shows how the growth coeﬃcients
of a frieze are recursively related to each other. This recursive relationship again
involves the principal growth coeﬃcient s1 as a coeﬃcient. Moreover, we use this
relationship to provide a closed formula for the kth growth coeﬃcient sk in terms of
the principal growth coeﬃcient.

3. Relating the pair of friezes of a triangulated annulus

In this section, we concentrate solely on periodic inﬁnite friezes of positive integers.
Recall that every such frieze arises from a triangulation of a punctured disc or of
an annulus, where we can assume without loss of generality that the set of marked
points on both boundaries is non-empty.
In the latter case, two periodic inﬁnite
friezes can be associated to the same triangulation: one for the outer boundary and
one for the inner boundary. In this section, we show that they can be considered to
have the same growth coeﬃcients. We observe that if we can obtain the two friezes
arising from a triangulation of an annulus via triangulations of a punctured disc,
then all growth coeﬃcients are equal to 2 for both friezes. Hence we already know
the claim is true in this case. Let us point out this happens if and only if there is no
bridging arc in the triangulation of the annulus, i.e. there is no arc connecting the two
boundaries. So from now on, we will assume for this section, that the triangulation
of the annulus contains bridging arcs (for details we refer to [1, Sections 3 and 4]).
We ﬁrst establish that we can add or remove triangles from a triangulation of
an annulus (or a punctured disc) without changing the growth behaviour: In [12,
Section 2], we described two algebraic operations on periodic inﬁnite friezes of posi-
tive integers, called n-gluing and n-cutting. In the language of triangulations, these
operations respectively add or remove a peripheral triangle in the triangulation asso-
ciated to the periodic inﬁnite frieze we are modifying. In particular, given a quiddity
sequence q “ pa1, . . . , anq, n-gluing above a pair pai, ai`1q produces the quiddity se-
quence ˆq “ pa1`2, 1q, if n “ 1, and ˆq “ pa1, . . . , ai`1, 1, ai`1`1, . . . , anq, otherwise.
Whenever we have an entry ai “ 1 in q, for some i P t1, . . . , nu, we can perform an
n-cutting above ai and the outcome is the quiddity sequence ˇq “ pai`1´ 2q, if n “ 2,
and ˇq “ pa1, . . . , ai´1´1, ai`1´1, anq, otherwise. (We recall that a quiddity sequence
of an inﬁnite frieze of positive integers cannot contain two consecutive ones.)
The next result states that these operations have no eﬀect on the growth coeﬃcient

associated to the quiddity sequences.

GROWTH BEHAVIOUR OF PERIODIC TAME FRIEZES

Theorem 3.1. Given a periodic inﬁnite frieze of positive integers with quiddity se-
quence q of length n, let ˆq and ˇq be quiddity sequences obtained from q by performing
n-gluing and n-cutting (if deﬁned), respectively. Then sq “ s ˆq and sq “ s ˇq.

As a direct consequence, it is enough to compute growth coeﬃcients for bridging
triangulations, i.e. for triangulations where all arcs are bridging.
In the proof of
Theorem 3.1, we will use the following lemma whose prove we omit as it is straight-
forward.

relates the entries of the two friezes as follows

Let T be a triangulation of An,m, where we assume n and m to be positive. Label
the vertices of the outer and inner boundaries anti-clockwise by t1, 2, . . . , nu and
t1, 2, . . . , mu respectively. The n-tuple q “ pa1, a2, . . . , anq with ai the number of
triangles incident with vertex i on the outer boundary is called the outer quiddity
sequence of length n. The inner quiddity sequence ¯q “ p¯a1, ¯a2, . . . , ¯amq of length
m is given by the numbers ¯ai of triangles incident with the vertices on the inner
boundary. We name the corresponding friezes generated by q and ¯q the outer frieze
and inner frieze respectively, and denote them by F and ¯F.

Figure 3.1. A triangulation of A5,2 providing outer quiddity se-
quence q “ p6, 1, 2, 5, 1q and inner quiddity sequence ¯q “ p3, 3q.

Every triangulation of An,m can be viewed as a periodic triangulation of an in-
ﬁnite strip in the plane by using the cylindrical representation of the annulus, and
translates of it, in the plane. For details, see [1, Section 3.3]. This point of view is
very convenient for determining entries in the associated friezes as they are given by
“matching numbers”. We will make frequent use of this. We will refer to a single
copy of the triangulation in the strip as a fundamental domain (for T ).

Clearly, considering triangulations of An,m, the entries in the outer quiddity se-
quence and the entries in the inner quiddity sequence are closely related. In partic-
ular, if the entries in one are large, that means the other must have a comparatively
high number of small entries, in order to balance. Indeed, one can easily convince
oneself that the average value of all ai’s and ¯ai’s is equal to three. Another re-
markable connection between the pair of outer and inner friezes is illustrated in the
example below and later stated in Theorem 3.4.

Example 3.3. We consider the triangulation of A5,2 given in Figure 3.1, yielding
the two quiddity sequences q “ p6, 1, 2, 5, 1q and ¯q “ p3, 3q for the outer and inner
boundary respectively. A “fundamental domain” for each associated frieze is given
in the ﬁgure below. We observe that the growth coeﬃcients of the two quiddity
sequences coincide. However, note that it is necessary to keep the quiddity sequences
exactly as they come from the triangulation, regardless of their period.

Theorem 3.4. Let F “ pmi,jqi,j and ¯F “ p ¯mi,jqi,j be the outer and inner boundary
pair of friezes associated to a triangulation of An,m pm ą 0q with quiddity sequences
q and ¯q, respectively. Then sq “ s ¯q.

Before commencing the proof of this result, we introduce some notions concerning
bridging triangulations in order to provide the necessary ingredients. Let T be a
triangulation of an annulus An,m with n, m ą 0. Due to Theorem 3.1, we can assume
T to be a bridging triangulation. So a fundamental domain for T in the inﬁnite strip
may be viewed as a collection of r alternating fans pr ě 1q as illustrated in Figure
i“1 mi, where the ni’s and mi’s are the
numbers of triangles in the fans (note that ni “ Ni ´ Ni´1 and mi “ Mi ´ Mi´1 for
each i). Without loss of generality, we may assume there is a fan starting at 1 at
each boundary (as shown).

i“1 ni and m “ Mr “řr

3.2 with n “ Nr “řr

Recall that, by [1, Theorem 5.6], for the outer frieze F “ pmi,jqi,j associated to
T , we have that mi,j is the number of matchings between the corresponding vertices
in the inﬁnite strip and triangles incident with them for all i ď j, with an analogous
statement holding for the inner frieze ¯F “ p ¯mi,jqi,j. Let q and ¯q be the quiddity
sequences of F and ¯F respectively.
Our strategy for the proof will be as follows: We will express sq “ m1,n ´ m2,n´1
in terms of n1, . . . , nr, m1, . . . , mr by counting matchings, and then show that the
expression we obtain is invariant under performing the substitution ni Ø mr`1´i
for all 1 ď i ď r. This suﬃces due to the fact the the expression obtained in this
manner must clearly be s ¯q. (Imagine rotating Figure 3.2 through 180˝; to be precise,
we obtain ¯m2,m`1 ´ ¯m3,m which is equal to s ¯q by Proposition 2.2.)
Using the fan structure of the triangulation, one can routinely establish the fol-
lowing results by iteratively building up matching numbers (noting that we take
empty sums to be 0).

It is immediate that sq “ s ¯q.

From the proof of Theorem 3.4, we have the following corollary.

Corollary 3.6. Let F and ¯F be the outer and inner boundary pair of friezes associ-
ated to a bridging triangulation T (as in Figure 3.2) of An,m pm ą 0q, with quiddity
sequences q and ¯q respectively. Then

We can easily make use of this to write a practical algebraic expression for the
growth coeﬃcient of a periodic inﬁnite frieze of positive integers which does not
contain determinants.

Corollary 3.10. For each integer greater or equal to 2, there exists a periodic inﬁ-
nite frieze of positive integers for which the principal growth coeﬃcient is given by
this value.

4. Growth behaviour of periodic friezes of positive integers

In this section, we analyse the sequence pskqkPN0 of growth coeﬃcients associated
to a periodic frieze of positive integers or its lattice (with integer entries). We
start by determining the growth coeﬃcients for ﬁnite friezes, before considering the
inﬁnite cases. In order to determine the growth behaviour of the growth coeﬃcients
of periodic friezes (of positive integers), we consider in particular sequences pskqkPN0
of integers with s0 “ 2, s1 P Z and which satisfy the recursion

sk`2 “ s1sk`1 ´ sk.

(8)

Proposition 4.1. Let F be a ﬁnite frieze of positive integers of order n. Then,
s1 P t´2, 0, 1u. Furthermore, the value of s1 is determined by the order of rotational
symmetry of the associated triangulation (of an n-gon).

Proof. Since F has order n, it is n-periodic and arises from a triangulation T of
an n-gon. In particular, the minimal period of F has to be an element of tn, n
2 , n
3u.
These correspond respectively to the cases where T has no rotational symmetry, 180
degree rotational symmetry, and 120 degree rotational symmetry. We work in the
lattice L “ pmi,jqi,j associated to F .

If n is the minimal period, then s1 “ m1,n ´ m2,n`1 “ ´1 ´ 1 “ ´2.
If the minimal period of F is n
Proposition 2.10 (a) yields s2 “ s2

Corollary 4.2. If F is a ﬁnite frieze of positive integers, then its growth sequence
is one of the following:

p2, 1,´1,´2,´1, 1, 2, 1, . . .q.
p2,´2, 2,´2, 2,´2, . . .q,
The ﬁrst of these growth sequences arises precisely when the associated triangulation
has no rotational symmetry. The second and third respectively arise from triangu-
lations with 180 degree and 120 degree rotational symmetry.

p2, 0,´2, 0, 2, 0,´2, . . .q,

Proof. In view of Proposition 4.1 (and its proof), the result follows directly from
Proposition 2.10.
(cid:3)

We note that the growth sequences appearing in Corollary 4.2 also arise as special

cases of Proposition 5.6 below.

Lemma 4.3. Let F be a periodic inﬁnite frieze of positive integers. Then

p1q sk ě 2 for all k ě 0,
p2q sk ď sk`1 for all k ě 0.

Furthermore, the inequalities in p2q are strict when s1 ą 2.
Proof. p1q In the case where F arises from a triangulation of a punctured disc, we
have from Remark 2.7 that sk “ 2, for all k. Otherwise, we have sk ą 2 for all k
from Corollary 3.8.
1 ´ 2 and from (1) we
have s1 ě 2, hence s2 ě s1. Then, by Proposition 2.10 (a) and induction, i.e.
sk`1 “ s1sk ´ sk´1 ě s1sk ´ sk “ skps1 ´ 1q, we obtain sk`1 ě sk for k ě 1, see also
Proposition 5.1 below. The ﬁnal sentence of the statement is clear.

Proposition 4.4. Let F be a periodic inﬁnite frieze of positive integers. The fol-
lowing are equivalent:

paq There exists k ą 0 such that sk “ 2.
pbq sk “ 2 for all k ě 0.
pcq F arises from a triangulation of a punctured disc.

Proof. We ﬁrst show that paq and pbq are equivalent. Assume st “ 2 for some t ą 0.
By Lemma 4.3 (1) and (2), we have 2 ď s1 ď s2 ď ¨¨¨ ď st “ 2, so sk “ 2 for all
1 ď k ď t. With Proposition 2.10 we can deduce inductively that sk “ 2 for all
k ą t. The other implication is trivial.
To see that pbq implies pcq is an immediate consequence of Corollary 3.8, and that
pcq implies pbq is stated in Remark 2.7.

Corollary 4.5. Let F be a periodic inﬁnite frieze of positive integers. The following
are equivalent:

paq There exists k ą 0 such that sk ą 2.
pbq sk ą 2 for all k ą 0.
pcq F does not arise from a triangulation of a punctured disc.

Theorem 4.6 (Dynamics of periodic friezes of positive integers). Let F be an n-
periodic frieze of positive integers with lattice L. Then the entries in any diagonal of
L` must have exactly one of the three behaviours: (a) they form periodic sequences;
(b) they grow linearly (when jumping in steps of n positions); (c) their growth is
asymptotically exponential, as speciﬁed in Proposition 4.7 below.

Proof. The lattice L arises from a ﬁnite or inﬁnite frieze of positive integers.
In
the ﬁnite case, it is clear that each diagonal of the lattice L`, and also L, forms a
periodic sequence.

So, assume F is inﬁnite. We have seen that sk “ 2 for all k if and only if F
arises from a triangulation of a punctured disc (Proposition 4.4). This is equivalent
to linear growth in the diagonals, for sequences of entries separated by n positions.
Finally, statement (c) follows from Proposition 4.7 below.
(cid:3)

Proposition 4.7 (Asymptotic exponential growth of superlinear periodic inﬁnite
friezes of positive integers). Let pskqkPN0 be the sequence of growth coeﬃcients of
a periodic inﬁnite frieze of positive integers not arising from a triangulation of a
punctured disc.

Then, the sequence pskqkPN0 grows monotonically and asymptotically exponentially

with the rate

where S P p1,8q

for

in the sense that for every 0 ă δ and every suﬃciently large index κ “ κpδq satisfying
S´2pκ´1qps1 ´ S ´ 1q ď δ, the following asymptotically exponential growth holds

sκ Sl ă sκ`l ă sκpS ` δql

for all

(9)

Thus, S is the exponentially asymptotic exponential growth rate (i.e. the asymptotic
exponential growth is approximated exponentially fast) of the sequence pskqkPN0.

Moreover, the frieze entries asymptotically obey the same asymptotically expo-
nential growth when considered in blocks of n rows. In particular, it follows from
Corollary 2.6, i.e. from mi,j`2kn “ skmi,j`kn ´ mi,j by recursively setting k “ 2l´k1
that

Thus, since for any frieze entries mi,J between the 2l`1-th and the 2l`2-th block of n
rows of the lattice L`, we have J “ j ` 2l`1n with j “ ˜j ` 2ln, it follows recursively
that mi,J “ mi,j`2l`1n “ OpS 2l`1
Proof. First, we note that s1 ą s0 “ 2 yields x1 – s2
s1 ą S (more precisely,
it is easy to verify that S ă s1 ´ 1 ă x1 for all s1 ą 2).
Then, Proposition 4.7 follows from case (EG) of Proposition 5.1 below, which
provides a more general analysis of the recursion (8). More precisely, the exponen-
tially asymptotic exponential growth (9) follows from case (EG) of Proposition 5.1
specialised to values x1 ą s1 ´ 1 ą S, and thus from the estimate (23) of Lemma
B.1, which also implies that S ă xk and 2 ă sk for all k ě 1. Finally, the growth
behaviour of the frieze entries follows in an elementary manner via iteration by using
k“0 2l´k “ 2l`1 ´ 1.

5. Growth behaviour of real-valued sequences and tame friezes

s1 “ s1 ´ s0

řl

In this section, we generalise the framework of growth coeﬃcients for tame real
periodic friezes and their lattices. More precisely, we consider sequences prkqkPN0,
which are deﬁned via the recursion (8), yet start from arbitrary initial values, i.e.

r1, r0 P R, k ě 0.

rk`2 “ r1rk`1 ´ rk,

(10)
A comprehensive analysis of the behaviour of the sequences prkqkPN0 deﬁned via
recursion (10) is provided below by Proposition 5.1 for |r1| ě 2 and Proposition 5.9
for |r1| ă 2. The results obtained are more general than what is required for the
growth coeﬃcients of inﬁnite integer- or real-valued friezes and also go beyond the
relationship between the (growth coeﬃcient like) sequences pskqkPN0 with s0 “ 2 and
Chebyshev polynomials in s1, see e.g. Example 2.11. Please note that for r0 ‰ 2,
the sequences prkqkPN0 do not rescale to Chebyshev polynomials in r1.

One key result of this section is Theorem 5.2 on the existence of generalised
recursion formulas, which implies an interesting relation between the existence of
p-periodic solutions of recursion (10) and the condition sp “ 2, where sp is the p-th
entry of the speciﬁc solution sequence pskqkPN0 of recursions (10) with s0 “ 2 and
s1 “ r1 P R.

At ﬁrst, we point out that by applying the rescaling rk “ r1tk for r1 ‰ 0 and

k ě 0, the rescaled recursion,

tk`2 “ r1tk`1 ´ tk,

t1 “ 1, t0 “

r0
r1 P R

separates the role of r1 as parameter of the recursion from the role of r1 as initial
value, which is now normalised to t1 “ 1 without loss of generality. The fact that
this rescaled recursion is subject to only one arbitrary initial value t0 suggests that
the two-stage recursion (10) can be transformed into a one-stage recursion: Indeed,
by denoting xk`1 :“ rk`2

Moreover, in case xk “ 0 for some k ě 1, then we uniquely extend the recursion
(11) by setting
(12)

xk “ 0 ùñ xk`1 :“ ´8,

xk`2 :“ r1,

and continue (11) accordingly.

The extension (12) corresponds exactly to the behaviour of recursion (10), where

rk`1 “ 0 (which is equivalent to xk “ 0) yields

rk`2 “ ´rk,

rk`3 “ r1rk`2

and thus xk`2 “

rk`3
rk`2 “ r1.

Moreover, the sign of xk`1 :“ ´8 reﬂects the fact that the sequence rk changes sign
when passing through zero, i.e. signprkrk`2q “ ´1.
Proposition 5.1 (Growth behaviour of the recursion (10) for |r1| ě 2).
Let |r1| ě 2. Then, the recursion

rk`2 “ r1rk`1 ´ rk,

|r1| ě 2, r0 P R .

yields sequences prkqkPN0 satisfying the following cases of linear and superlinear
growth:
(LG) (Linear/Constant Growth) If r1 “ 2, then a straightforward induction proves

rk`1 “ pk ` 1qr1 ´ kr0 “ kpr1 ´ r0q ` r1.

In particular, the only one-periodic, constant pattern of the recursion (10)
(see also Proposition 5.6 below) has the initial values r0 “ r1 “ 2, i.e. rk “ 2
for all k P N0.
Moreover, the only integer-valued sequences prkqkPN0 for which rk “ 0
is possible for some k ě 2 (and thus the extension rule (12) is neces-
sary) are found in the special case r2 “ 1, e.g. pr0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, . . .q “
p3, 2, 1, 0,´1,´2, . . .q.

(EG) (Exponential Growth) If r1 ą 2 and r0 P R, then the behaviour of the two-
stage recursion (10) follows from the one-stage recursion (11) with the ex-
tension rule (12). In particular, Lemma B.1 implies that the recursion (10)
grows exponentially in the following sense: For every 0 ă ε ă S ´ 1 with S
given in (20), i.e.

for

r1 P p2,8q.

there exists an index K “ Kpεq, suﬃciently large, such that

as

l Ñ 8.

Note, that the exponential growth stated in the above inequalities holds inde-
pendently of the sign of rK, and that it is possible that the sequence prkqkPN0
underwent a sign change prior to the index K.

The only integer-valued sequences prkqkPN0 for which rk “ 0 is possible (and
thus the extension rule (12) is necessary) are found in the special cases r2 “
1, e.g. for r1 “ 3, we ﬁnd pr0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, . . .q “ p8, 3, 1, 0,´1,´3, . . .q.

(S) (Sign Alternating Growth) If r1 ď ´2 and r2 P R, then the following modiﬁed
transformation of the two-stage recursion (10) into the one-stage recursion

have

Thus, the results of cases (LG) and (EG) carry over accordingly and lead to
sign alternating, linear or superlinear growing sequences prkqkPN0.
periodic pattern is two-periodic with r0 “ 2. In this case, we have

In the special case r1 “ ´2, Proposition 5.6 implies that the only possible

which arises from any triangulation of a polygon which has no rotational
symmetry, i.e. from the quiddity sequence (1,4,1,2,2,2), and corresponds to
˜xk`1 “ ˜x1 “ 1 for all k P N0 with ˜x1 “ ´ ´2

Proof. The proof of item (LG) is a straightforward induction, while the proof of
(EG) follows from Lemma B.1 stated in the Appendix B. Finally, (S) then follows
as explained in the statement.
(cid:3)

Proposition 5.1 provides an essentially complete analysis of the recursion (10), for

the cases |r1| ě 2, based on the results of Lemma B.1.

For |r1| ă 2, Lemma B.1 implies that the one-stage recursion (19) has no ﬁxed
point and that the dynamics of the growth coeﬃcient recursion (10) must feature
periodic solutions or possibly more complicated behaviour (like almost-periodic or
even chaotic sequences). A complete analysis of the recursion (10) in this case may
therefore be very hard.

The following theorem exhibits an interesting relationship between any real-valued
sequence prkqkPN0 satisfying (10) and the speciﬁc associated sequence pskqkPN0, whose
initial values are s0 “ 2 and s1 “ r1, and which also satisﬁes (10). Namely, the ele-
ments of the latter sequence appear as coeﬃcients in generalised recursion formulas
involving the elements of the former.

Theorem 5.2 (Generalised recursion formulas).
Consider a real valued sequence prkqkPN0 such that the recursion (10) is satisﬁed. Let
pskqkPN0 be the sequence satisfying (10) with the initial values s0 “ 2, s1 “ r1 P R.
Then, for all p ě 0 and k ě 0, we have

rk`2p “ sprk`p ´ rk.

Proof. We show the claim using induction on p. For p “ 0, the claim requires
rk “ 2rk ´ rk, which is true. If p “ 1, we get rk`2 “ s1rk`1 ´ rk, which holds by the
recursion (10) since s1 “ r1.
Now assume the claim holds for some p ě 1, and also for p´ 1. We have to deduce
that rk`2pp`1q ´ sp`1rk`pp`1q ` rk “ 0. First, by the recursion (10), i.e. rk`2pp`1q “
r1rk`2p`1 ´ rk`2p, and by the induction hypothesis rk`1`2p “ sprk`1`p ´ rk`1, we get

rk`2pp`1q “ r1sprk`1`p ´ r1rk`1 ´ rk`2p.

GROWTH BEHAVIOUR OF PERIODIC TAME FRIEZES

23

Then, by using (10) again, i.e. ´r1rk`1 “ ´rk`2 ´ rk and ´sp`1 “ ´r1sp ` sp´1, we
compute

rk`2pp`1q ´ sp`1rk`pp`1q ` rk “ ´rk`2 ´ rk`2p ` sp´1rk`p`1 “ 0,

where the last identity holds again by the induction hypothesis since sp´1rk`p`1 “
sp´1rk`2`pp´1q “ rk`2`2pp´1q ` rk`2. This completes the proof.
Remark 5.3. Theorem 5.2 generalises the special case when r0 “ 2 (i.e. rk “ sk for
all k ě 0) for which the specialised recursion formulas sk`2p “ spsk`p´sk correspond
to a well-known property of Chebyshev polynomials. Moreover, we remark that in
this special case, the generalised recursions sk`2p “ spsk`p ´ sk for p ě 1 enable the
derivation of further explicit expressions, e.g. for s2l for l P N0.

(cid:3)

As a consequence of Theorem 5.2, we can, for any p ě 1, deﬁne

and observe that

the one-stage recursion (11) with modiﬁed parameter r1 “ s1 Ñ sp for all p ě 1.
In particular, we recall that (13) is therefore a generalisation of the recursion (11),
which we recover in the case p “ 1, with yl “ xl. The multi-stage recursion (13)
yields the following Corollary on periodic subsequences and sequences.

Corollary 5.4 (Periodic subsequences and periodic sequences).
Consider, as in Theorem 5.2, a real-valued sequence prkqkPN0 satisfying the recursion
(10), together with the sequence pskqkPN0 with the initial values s0 “ 2, s1 “ r1 P R.
Let 1 ď p P N. Then, for 0 ď l ď p ´ 1, the sequence prkqkPN0 has a p-periodic
subsequence prl`npqnPN0, i.e.

rl`pn`1qp “ yl`np rl`np “ rl`np,

@n P N0,

Moreover, if y0 “ 1 and y1 “ 1, then yl “ 1 for all 0 ď l ď p´ 1 and the sequence

if and only if sp “ 2 and yl “ 1.
prkqkPN0 is consequently p-periodic provided that sp “ 2.
Proof. First, the analysis of the recursion (13) in Lemma B.1 in Appendix B implies
for all 0 ď l ď p ´ 1 that yl`np “ 1 is a ﬁxed point of (13) if and only if sp “ 2
and yl “ 1. Then, given that yl “ 1 and yl`1 “ 1, it follows by induction that
rp`l`2 “ r1rp`l`1 ´ rp`l “ r1rl`1 ´ rl “ rl`2, which implies yl`2 “ 1.
Remark 5.5. In fact, explicit calculations will show that for all the examples of
periodic solutions of (10) exhibited in Proposition 5.6 below, the conditions sp “ 2
and y0 “ 1 imply also y1 “ 1. Moreover, for p ě 3, it is even true in these cases
that sp “ 2 implies y0 “ 1 and y1 “ 1, which is the reason for three-, four-, and
six-periodic solutions existing for all r0 P R. However, we were unable to turn these
observations into a general theorem.

Corollary 5.4 now enables us to prove the following Proposition 5.6, which char-
acterises all one-, two-, three-, four- and six-periodic solutions of the recursion (10).
In particular, we are able to identify all possible periodic solutions of (10) for the
integer values r1 “ 0,˘1,˘2. For higher periods p, we point out that the condition
sp “ 2 (despite being a polynomial equation of order p) can be solved due to the
relationship between the sequence pskqkPN0 and the properties of extremal points of
Chebyshev polynomials. More precisely, we have that

sp “ 2 cospp arccospr1{2qq,

|r1| ď 2,

Please note that not all values of r1 for which sp “ 2 holds, give rise to genuinely
p-periodic behaviour. By taking k “ 0 in (14), for instance, the following Proposi-
tion 5.6 will show that r1 “ 2 allows only a one-periodic solution, which is of course
also p-periodic. Similarly, all divisors of p yield non-genuinely p-periodic solutions.

Proposition 5.6 (Characterisation of periodic solutions of (10) of small periods).
Consider the recursion

Then,
‚ the only possible one-periodic sequence is the constant sequence pr0, r1, r2, . . .q “
p2, 2, 2, . . .q. In turn, given r1 “ 2, the only possible periodic sequence requires
also r0 “ 2, which yields the same constant sequence rk “ 2,@k P N0.
‚ the only possible two-periodic sequence is pr0, r1, r2, r3, . . .q “ p2,´2, 2,´2, . . .q.

Proof of Proposition 5.6. First, we recall the one-stage recursion (11), i.e.

xk`1 “ r1 ´

and

xk “

r1 ´ xk`1

.

The following cases follow from elementary considerations and Theorem 5.2.

One-periodic solutions of (10): We recall recursion (11), or equally recursion (13)
for p “ 1, and require

rk`1 “ xkrk “ rk, ðñ xk “ 1,

@k P N,

which is equivalent to 1 being a ﬁxed point of (11), which is in turn equivalent to
r1 “ 2 and x1 “ 1 due to Lemma B.1 in Appendix B. Since 2 “ x1r1 “ r2 “ r2
1 ´ r0,
these two conditions imply r0 “ 2. Thus, as already found in Proposition 5.1, the
only possible one-periodic pattern is pr0, r1, r2, r3, . . .q “ p2, 2, 2, 2, . . .q.
Two-periodic solutions of (10): By recalling the multi-stage recursion (13) for p “ 2
and s2 “ r2

1 ´ 2, i.e.

yk`2 “ pr2

(15)

we ﬁnd (again by Lemma B.1) that (15) has a ﬁxed point yk`2 “ yk “ 1 iﬀ r2
1´2 “ 2,
i.e. r1 “ ˘2 and y0 “ 1. Similarly, a ﬁxed point yk`3 “ yk`1 “ 1 occurs iﬀ r2
1´2 “ 2,
i.e. r1 “ ˘2 and y1 “ 1. Moreover, we calculate r0 “ y0r0 “ r2 “ 4 ´ r0, which
yields r0 “ 2. Also, r3 “ r1pr2
1 ´ r0 ´ 1q, which implies that y1 “ 1 holds also
provided r0 “ 2. Thus, for r1 “ 2, we recover the above one-periodic pattern, while
for r1 “ ´2, we have the stated two-periodic pattern p2,´2, 2,´2, . . .q.
Three-periodic and three-anti-periodic solutions of (10): By recalling the multi-stage
recursion (13) for p “ 3 and s3 “ r1pr2

1 ´ 3q, i.e.

yk`3 “ r1pr2

1 ´ 3q ´

1

(16)

and Corollary 5.4, we observe that prkqkPN0 is a three-periodic pattern iﬀ r1pr2
1´3q “
2 and y0 “ y1 “ 1. Moreover, r1pr2
1 ´ 3q “ 2 has the solutions r1 “ ´1, 2. For
r1 “ 2, the above arguments recover the one-periodic pattern p2, 2, 2, 2, . . .q. For
r1 “ ´1, we calculate r3 “ r0 which yields y0 “ 1 independently of r0. Moreover,
r4 “ ´1 “ r1 implies y1 “ 1 holds (independently of r0). Thus, for any r0 P R, we
have three-periodic patterns pr0,´1, 1 ´ r0, r0,´1, 1 ´ r0, . . .q.

More generally, all ﬁxed points y of the three-step recursion (16) must satisfy

Three-periodic solutions correspond to y “ 1, which is equivalent to r1 “ ´1.
Moreover, for r1 “ 1, we have y “ ´1, which leads to three-anti-periodic solutions
and thus, six-periodic solutions provided that y0 “ y1 “ ´1 (see below).

we see that prkqkPN0 is a six-periodic pattern iﬀ r2
1`9q´2 “ 2 and y0 “ y1 “ 1.
Moreover, r2
1 ` 9q ´ 2 “ 2 has the solutions r1 “ ˘1,˘2. For r1 “ ˘2, this
leads to the above one- and two-periodic patterns. For r1 “ ´1, we recover the above
three-periodic family of patterns. Finally, for r1 “ 1, we recover precisely the six-
periodic family of patterns that arose above as three-anti-periodic patterns. These
six-periodic patterns have the form pr0, 1, 1 ´ r0,´r0,´1,´1 ` r0, r0, 1, 1 ´ r0, . . .q,
with r0 P R.
Example 5.7. A source of one-periodic real friezes are regular convex polygons. Let
P be the regular convex n-gon with sides of length one: the length of the shortest
diagonal in P serves as the entry a for the quiddity sequence paq. One can check that
the diamond rule then amounts to calculating the lengths of the diﬀerent diagonals
in the polygon via the Ptolemy rule. In the case of the square, a “ ?2 “ r1, in the
case of the hexagon, a “ ?3 “ r1. The former leads to a four-anti-periodic sequence
prkqk, the latter to a six-anti-periodic sequence prkqk, both with r0 “ 2. We can
take this further and describe any periodic sequence prkqk with arbitrary r0 P R and
r1 “ ˘?2 or r1 “ ˘?3:
‚ If r1 “ ˘?2, then all sequences prkqkPN0 satisfying (10) are four-anti-periodic
‚ If r1 “ ˘?3, then all sequences prkqkPN0 satisfying (10) are six-anti-periodic and

In order to calculate six-anti-periodic sequences prkqkPN0 (rather than looking at
ﬁxed points of the six-stage recursion (18), which requires solving a sixth order
polynomial), we observe that six-anti-periodic sequences prkqkPN0 are build of three-
anti-periodic patterns of the two-stage-recursion (15), which exist if and only if

The above example of ﬁnding six-anti-periodic sequences prkqkPN0 indicates a prac-
tical way to determine periodic solutions, where the periodicity p can be factorised
into suﬃciently small numbers. This is described in the following remark.
Remark 5.8. In order to study, for instance, six-periodic sequences prkqkPN0, in-
stead of directly analysing the six-stage recursion (18) (which leads to sixth order
polynomials), we can alternatively consider three-periodic patterns of the two-step
recursion (15), where we require that the recursion parameter s2 “ r2
1 ´ 2 of (15)
equals minus one, i.e. r2
1 ´ 2 “ ´1 ðñ r1 “ ˘1. Observe that only for r1 “ 1 are
these patterns genuinely six-periodic (and three-anti-periodic), while for r1 “ ´1,
we recover three-periodic patterns.
Similarly, we can also consider two-periodic solutions of the three-step recursion
1 ´ 3q of (15) equals minus two,

(16), where we require that the parameter s3 “ r1pr2
i.e.

r1pr2

1 ´ 3q “ ´2 ðñ pr1 ´ 1q2pr1 ` 2q “ 0 ðñ r1 “ 1 _ r1 “ ´2,

and recall that r1 “ ´2 leads to a two-periodic pattern.

As a consequence of Proposition 5.6, we obtain the following results on the dy-

namics of the recursion (10) for |r1| ă 2.
Proposition 5.9 (Dynamics of the recursion (10) for |r1| ă 2.).
Let |r1| ă 2. Then, the growth coeﬃcient recursion (10), i.e.
|r1| ă 2, r0 P R .

rk`2 “ r1rk`1 ´ rk,

yields sequences prkqkPN0 satisfying the following cases of periodic behaviour:

In the special case r1 “ 1, Proposition 5.6 implies that all sequences prkqkPN0

which arises from the quiddity sequence (1,3,1,3,1,3,. . . ) from the triangulations
with 1200 symmetry of the hexagon by an inner triangle.

In general, the sequence prkqkPN0 will undergo inﬁnitely many sign changes. It
is an open problem for which r1 P p0, 2qzt1u there exist periodic or non-periodic
sequences, how frequently it may occur that rk “ 0 for some k P N0, and what
kind of sign-changing periodic pattern or even strange attractors might exist.

Proposition 5.1) yields the one-stage recursion (19) with parameter |r1|. Thus,
the above results carry over accordingly.

Appendix A. Proof of Proposition 2.10 (b)

Proof. Let F be an n-periodic frieze (n the minimal period). We have the recursive
formula sk`2 “ s1sk`1 ´ sk from Proposition 2.10 (a). This holds for k ě 0, with
s0 “ 2.

Now, we want to prove the following closed formula: For k ě 1, we have

To prove this, we use induction on k. The claim is true for k “ 1, 2. So assume
the claim holds for k ´ 1 and for k. By (a), we have sk`1 “ s1sk ´ sk´1. We use the
induction hypothesis to replace sk and sk´1, thus obtaining the followng expression
for sk`1 (note that in the third line, the summands involving sk´1
are grouped into
one term and the sums are corrected accordingly):

Appendix B. Lemma B.1

Lemma B.1. Let s1 ě 2 and consider, for k ě 1, the recursion

xk`1 “ s1 ´

1
xk “: fps1, xkq,

x1 P R,

(19)

which is generalised by the extension rule (12), i.e. if xk “ 0 for some k ě 1, then
we set xk`1 “ ´8, xk`2 “ s1 and continue (19).

Then, the extended recursion (19) exhibits the stable ﬁxed point

and the unstable ﬁxed point

S :“

U :“

2ˆ1 `bs2
2ˆ1 ´bs2

1 ´ 4˙ with
1 ´ 4˙ with

1

1 ď S ă 8 for

s1 P r2,8q,

(20)

0 ă U ď 1

for

s1 P r2,8q.

(21)

In particular, the stable ﬁxed-point S attracts all initial values x1 P RztUu expo-
nentially fast in the following sense: If x1 P pU, Sq, then for every K ě 1 we have
U ă x1 ă xK ă xK`1 ă S and

pS ´ xKq,

@ k, K ě 1,

(22)

where Sx1 ą SU “ 1. If x1 P RzrU, Ss, then there exists an index K ě 1 such that
S ă xK. Moreover, it holds that S ă xK`k`1 ă xK`k ă xK for all k ě 1 and

S ´ xK`k ă´ 1
SxK¯k

S 2¯k
xK`k ´ S ă´ 1

pxK ´ Sq,

@ k ě 1.

(23)

If s1 “ 2, then S “ U “ 1 is a single unstable ﬁxed point, which is repelling to the
left yet attracts all initial values x1 P R from above, i.e. limkÑ8 xk Œ S “ 1 (which
is a consequence of ´8 ď xk ă 0 implying xk`1 ě s1 ą S).
Remark B.2. The recursion (19) needs to be extended by (12) to pass through zero
and minus inﬁnity at most once. More precisely, the set of initial values x1 ‰ 0, for
which xk “ 0 holds after ﬁnitely many iterations of the recursion (19) is a countable

set N of initial values within the interval“ 1

s1

, U˘,
, U¯ yk “ pf ´1qpkqp0q

N :“"yk P” 1

s1

for all k ě 1* ,

(24)

for which it follows from the proof of Lemma B.1 that U ą yk`1 ą yk for all
k ě 1. Thus, if for some k P N, we are looking for yk “ x1 “ s2
, we then require
s2 “ s1yk P r1, s1Uq Ă r1, 2q, where the last inclusion follows from s1U “ U 2 ` 1 (by
deﬁnition) and U 2 ` 1 ď 2. As a consequence, if xk “ 0, then xk`2 “ s1 R N since
s1 ě 2 and thus xk`l ‰ 0 for all l ě 2, which means the recursion (19) will not pass
through zero again.

s1

GROWTH BEHAVIOUR OF PERIODIC TAME FRIEZES

Proof. Possible ﬁxed points x of the recursion (19) are determined by x “ s1 ´ 1
x,
which is equivalent to solving the quadratic equation

Fps1, xq :“ x2 ´ s1x ` 1 “ 0 ùñ x1 “ S, x2 “ U,

where S and U are given as in (20) and (21), and the stated properties are easily
veriﬁed.

Next, it is straightforward to check the monotonicity property of the recursion

(19) by calculating

xk`1 ´ xk “ s1 ´

1
xk ´ xk “ ´

Fps1, xkq

xk

.

Thus, by observing that Fps1, xq ă 0 ðñ x P pU, Sq Ă p0,`8q, and upon deﬁning
the intervals

II :“ pU, Sq,

IV :“ r´8, 0q,

III :“ r0, Uq,
it follows with the extension rule (12) that
xk`1 ă xk ô rFps1, xkq ą 0 ^ xk ą 0s _ rxk “ 0 ^ xk`1 “ ´8s ô xk P III Y I,
xk`1 ą xk ô rFps1, xkq ă 0 ^ xk ą 0s _ rFps1, xkq ą 0 ^ xk ă 0s ô xk P IV Y II.
Bx fps1, xq “ x´2 ą 0, which means that the recursion (19) is

Moreover, we have B

order preserving, i.e.

Finally, we observe that xk`1 “ 0 ðñ xk “ 1

which motivates us to deﬁne

xk ď ¯xk ùñ xk`1 ď ¯xk`1.

Altogether, we conclude that the mapping f satisﬁes the following monotonicity

properties:

f :

bijective and order preserving with xk`1 ă xk,
with xk`1 “ fpSq “ S “ xk,
bijective and order preserving with xk`1 ą xk,
with xk`1 “ fpUq “ U “ xk,
bijective and order preserving with xk`1 ă xk,
bijective and order preserving with xk`1 ă xk,
bijective and order preserving with xk`1 ą xk.

(25)

Therefore, according to the monotonicity properties (25), all initial values x1 P
IVY IIY I as well as all initial values x1 P IIIz N will converge to S without passing
through zero. Here the set N as deﬁned in (24) is the set of all values, which are
mapped onto 0 during the recursion and for which the recursion has to be extended

32

K. BAUR, K. FELLNER, M. J. PARSONS, M. TSCHABOLD

by rule (12) to pass through zero and minus inﬁnity. The set N is obtained from
considering the backward recursion

xk “ f ´1pxk`1q “

s1 ´ xk`1

and the same monotonicity arguments as above imply that the backward recursion

Finally, the stated rates of convergence follows from observing that

s1

s1

xk`1 ´ S “ rkpxk ´ Sq,

where

(26)

Since for x1 P pU, Sq, the sequence pxkqkPN is strictly monotone increasing and
limkÑ8 xk Õ S, the statement (22) follows directly from (26), which is a contraction
since prkq´1 ě pr1q´1 “ Sx1 ą SU “ 1 for k ě 1. Similarly, for 0 ď x1 ă U the
recursion (19) is monotone decreasing and there exists an index K ě 3 such that
xK´1 ă 0, and thus xK ě s1 ą S (this includes the case xK´2 “ 0, xK´1 “ ´8 and
xK “ s1 arising via the extension rule (12)). Thus, if x1 P RzrU, Ss, there exists
an index K ě 1 such that S ă xK. We then have that S ă xK`k for all k ě 0
and limkÑ8 xK`k Œ S. Moreover, since 1 ą S´2 ą rK`k ě rK for all k ě 0, the
contraction (26) directly yields the exponential convergence (23).
