Abstract

Using the Slavnov–Taylor identities we prove that the three-point ghost vertices with
a single line of the quantum gauge superﬁeld are not renormalized in all loops in N = 1
supersymmetric gauge theories. This statement is veriﬁed by the explicit one-loop calcu-
lation made by the help of the BRST invariant version of the higher covariant derivative
regularization. Using the restrictions to the renormalization constants which are imposed by
the non-renormalization of the considered vertices we express the exact NSVZ β-function in
terms of the anomalous dimensions of the Faddeev–Popov ghosts and of the quantum gauge
superﬁeld. In the expression for the NSVZ β-function obtained in this way the contributions
of the Faddeev–Popov ghosts and of the matter superﬁelds have the same structure.

Introduction

Existence of ultraviolet divergences is a long standing problem of quantum ﬁeld theory. Su-
persymmetry allows to improve the ultraviolet behaviour due to the so-call non-renormalization
theorems. For example, N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills (SYM) theory is ﬁnite in all orders
[1, 2, 3, 4], and N = 2 supersymmetric theories are divergent only in the one-loop approxima-
tion [1, 4, 5]. Using the N = 2 non-renormalization theorem it is possible to construct ﬁnite
theories with N = 2 supersymmetry [6]. It is well known that the superpotential of N = 1
supersymmetric theories does not receive divergent quantum corrections [7], and the β-function
of these theories is related to the anomalous dimension by a special equation [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13],
which is called the exact NSVZ β-function (or the NSVZ relation). For the N = 1 SYM theory
without matter superﬁelds the NSVZ equation gives the exact expression for the β-function,
which appears to be a geometric progression.

The non-renormalization theorems appear due to large symmetries of a theory. Therefore,
deriving them it is essential to assume that these symmetries remain unbroken at the quantum
level. This means that one has to use an invariant regularization.1 In supersymmetric theories
it is not a trivial problem [18], because the dimensional regularization [19, 20, 21, 22] breaks
the supersymmetry [23], while its modiﬁcation called the dimensional reduction [24] is not
mathematically consistent [25]. Removing of the inconsistencies leads to the loss of manifest
supersymmetry [26] and to breaking supersymmetry by quantum corrections in higher loops

1Non-invariant regularizations supplemented by a special subtraction scheme which restore the Slavnov–Taylor

identities can be also used [14, 15, 16, 17], but they are much more inconvenient.

[27, 28, 29]. Actually, the only invariant regularization which can keep supersymmetry and
the gauge invariance unbroken is the higher covariant derivative regularization [30, 31]. In the
supersymmetric case it can be formulated in the manifestly supersymmetric way in terms of N =
1 superﬁelds [32, 33]. It was also generalized to the case of N = 2 supersymmetry [34, 35], but in
order to have manifest N = 2 supersymmetry at all steps of quantum corrections calculating one
should formulate the higher derivative regularization in N = 2 harmonic superspace [36, 37].
This was done in [38] and allows to give a simple proof of the N = 2 non-renormalization
theorem.

In this paper we investigate renormalization of theories with N = 1 supersymmetry, so that
we will use the N = 1 supersymmetric BRST invariant version of the higher covariant derivative
regularization. This regularization allows to calculate quantum corrections in a manifestly gauge
and N = 1 supersymmetric way. An example of such a calculation can be found in [39], where
the one-loop divergences have been obtained using this regularization. The result reveals an
interesting feature of the quantum corrections: the three-point vertices with two ghost legs and
one leg of the quantum gauge superﬁelds are ﬁnite in the one-loop approximation. In this paper
we prove that this fact is not accidental and follows from the Slavnov–Taylor identities [40, 41] for
the general renormalizable N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory with matter. In principle, this
statement can be considered as a new non-renormalization theorem in N = 1 supersymmetric
theories. Moreover, it seems to be useful for deriving the exact NSVZ β-function by the direct
summation of Feynman diagrams in the non-Abelian case.

In the Abelian case the NSVZ relation was obtained by the direct summation of Feynman
diagrams in all orders for the renormalization group (RG) functions deﬁned in terms of the bare
coupling constant in [42, 43]. A similar expression for the Adler D-function [44] in N = 1 SQCD
was also derived in [45, 46]. Both these derivations are based on the observation that the integrals
giving the β-function (deﬁned in terms of the bare coupling constant) in supersymmetric theories
are integrals of (double) total derivatives in the momentum space [47, 48]. This structure of
loop integrals was conﬁrmed by a large number of explicit loop calculations (see, e.g.
[49, 50,
51, 52, 53, 35, 38]).
It allows calculating one of the loop integrals analytically and relating
renormalization of the coupling constant in a certain order to the renormalization of the matter
superﬁelds in the previous order. Qualitatively this picture is illustrated by Fig. 1 [48, 53, 54].
From the left we present two-loop diagrams contributing to the β-function. They contain two
external lines of the background gauge superﬁeld attached to the same two-loop vacuum graph,
which is shown in the center of the ﬁgure. Cutting the matter line in this graph we obtain
the one-loop diagram contributing to the anomalous dimension of the matter superﬁelds. The
detailed discussion of the corresponding results in the three-loop approximation can be found in
[53].

In the non-Abelian case cuts of internal lines will give the diagrams contributing to the
anomalous dimensions of the matter superﬁelds, of the quantum gauge superﬁeld, and of the
Faddeev–Popov ghosts. Therefore, it is desirable to express the β-function in terms of these
anomalous dimensions. In this paper we will demonstrate that this can be done using the non-
renormalization theorem for the three-point vertices with two ghost lines and one line of the
quantum gauge superﬁeld. In particular, we will see that chiral ghosts superﬁelds and chiral
matter superﬁelds similarly contribute to the NSVZ β-function. Thus, the statement derived in
this paper may occur very useful for deriving the NSVZ relation in the non-Abelian case.

This paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2 we consider a general renormalizable N = 1
SYM theory with matter. We regularize it by the BRST invariant version of the higher covariant
derivative regularization in order that supersymmetry, the background gauge symmetry, and the
BRST symmetry will be unbroken at the quantum level. Then the Slavnov–Taylor identities are
constructed using the BRST invariance of the (regularized) theory. In Sect. 3 these Slavnov–
Taylor identities are written for the three-point ghost-gauge vertices. Using them in Sect. 4

Figure 1: This ﬁgure qualitatively illustrates how the diagrams contributing to the β-function
produce the corresponding diagrams contributing to the anomalous dimension. (The bold exter-
nal lines corresponds to the background gauge superﬁeld V , while the thin wavy lines correspond
to the quantum gauge superﬁeld. The matter propagators are denoted by the usual line.)

we prove the ﬁniteness of these vertices. (Note that we consider the vertices with the quantum
gauge superﬁeld.) This statement is veriﬁes by the explicit one-loop calculation in Sect. 5.
Finally, in Sect. 6 using the non-renormalization theorem proved in this paper we rewrite the
NSVZ relation for the N = 1 non-Abelian SYM theories in such a form that the Faddeev–Popov
ghosts, the quantum gauge superﬁeld, and the chiral matter superﬁelds similarly contribute to
the right hand side. In this section we also discuss, why this form of the NSVZ relation is useful
for making a general prove of the exact NSVZ β-function by summing the Feynman diagrams.
Also here we suggest the conditions that deﬁne the NSVZ scheme in the non-Abelian case with
the BRST-invariant version of the higher covariant derivative regularization, if the RG functions
are deﬁned in terms of the renormalized coupling constants.

where A = ie0ABT B is an arbitrary chiral superﬁeld in the adjoint representation of the gauge
group. We also deﬁne the superﬁeld Ω as a solution of the equation e2V ≡ eΩ+
eΩ. Using this
superﬁeld one can introduce the background ﬁeld method [55, 56, 57] by making the substitution

e2V → e−A+

e2V e−A,

φ → eAφ;

The background gauge superﬁeld V is then deﬁned by the equation e2V = eΩ+
eΩ, and V
becomes a quantum gauge superﬁeld. The background ﬁeld method enables us to construct the
eﬀective action manifestly invariant under the background gauge transformations

eΩ → eΩeΩ.

eΩ → eiK eΩe−A;

eΩ → eΩe−iK;

V → eiK V e−iK ;

φ → eAφ,

(6)

where the parameter K is a hermitian superﬁeld. The quantum gauge invariance is broken by
the gauge ﬁxing procedure, the remaining symmetry being the BRST invariance [58, 59].

At the quantum level the gauge invariance is encoded in the Slavnov–Taylor identities [40, 41].
These identities follows from the BRST invariance of the full action which also includes a gauge
ﬁxing term and ghosts. That is why we will regularize the considered theory in such a way
that the BRST invariance is unbroken. Certainly, it is also highly desirable that supersymmetry
is also unbroken. Both these requirements can be satisﬁed if the higher covariant derivative
method is used for regularization. Following Ref.
[39], we add to the classical action (1) the
term containing the higher covariant derivatives

where the regulators R and F rapidly grow at the inﬁnity. Consequently, the propagators
contain large degrees of momentums in the denominator and all diagrams beyond the one-loop
approximation [60] become convergent (except for the one-loop subdivergencies). The remaining
one-loop divergencies and subdivergencies should be regularized by inserting the Pauli–Villars
determinants into the generating functional [61]. Then the generating functional can be written
as

Z[V , Sources] =Z Dµ Det(P V, MΦ)Det(P V, Mϕ)−1

where the sources should be expressed in terms of ﬁelds in the standard way.

In this paper we are interested in diagrams which do not contain external lines of the back-
ground superﬁeld. Therefore, below we set the background ﬁeld to 0. In this case after elimi-

Also we will use one more identity which can be derived by making the substitution ¯c → ¯c+a,
where a is an arbitrary chiral superﬁeld. After this substitution and diﬀerentiating the result
with respect to a we obtain the ﬁrst of the following identities:

where the background gauge superﬁeld is also set to 0. The second identity can be found by the
similar method, if one make the substitution ¯c+ → ¯c+ + a+. (These identities are well-known.
For the (non-supersymmetric) Yang–Mills theory they are derived, e.g., in [62].)

The Slavnov–Taylor identities allow proving the renormalizability of the supersymmetric
gauge theories [63, 64, 65, 66]. As a consequence, all divergencies can be absorbed into the
renormalization of superﬁelds and coupling constants.
In our notation, the renormalization
constants are deﬁned by the following equations

similarly to Ref. [39]. Here the subscript R denotes renormalized superﬁelds, α, λ, and ξ are the
renormalized coupling constant, Yukawa constant, and gauge parameter, respectively; m denotes
the renormalized masses. We can impose the following conditions on these renormalization
constants:

j = (pZφ)i

(Zm)i

j = (Zλ)i

j;

Zξ = Z −2
V ;

Zb = Z −1
α .

(19)

It is possible due to the non-renormalization of the superpotential, transversality of quantum
corrections to the two-point Green function of the (quantum) gauge superﬁeld, and structure
of the Nielsen–Kallosh ghost Lagrangian, respectively.
In general, these conditions are not
mandatory, because ﬁnite renormalizations are also possible. However, these relation are natural
and convenient. That is why below we will assume that they are always valid.

3 Slavnov–Taylor identities for the V ¯cc vertices

In this section we obtain the Slavnov–Taylor identities for the three-point vertices of the
V ¯cc-type, which are a key ingredient for proving the non-renormalization theorem for these
vertices.

Let us diﬀerentiate the Slavnov–Taylor identity (14) with respect to ¯c∗B

w . After
this, we set all ﬁelds equal to 0 and take into account that, due to the symmetry leading to the

legs can be non-trivial. The result has the form

Also we need two correlators containing derivatives of(cid:10)δcB(cid:11) = ε · ie0f BCD(cid:10)cCcD(cid:11) /2, which

enter into Eqs. (24) and (25). In order to investigate them let us introduce the (Grassmannian

construction, the function H satisﬁes the relation

H(p, q) = H(p, −q − p).

Certainly, the functions H and eH also depend on the regularization parameter Λ and the bare

coupling constants, but, for simplicity, we do not write these arguments. From Eq. (31) we
conclude that the Green functions (30) are explicitly written as

Substituting these expressions into the Slavnov–Taylor identities (24) and (25) (and taking into

them in the ﬁnal form2

where we take into account the identity D2 ¯D2D2 = −16∂2D2, which follows from the algebra
of the supersymmetric covariant derivatives.

These identities can be easily veriﬁed in the tree approximation. Starting from the expression
for the classical action (which includes the ghosts and the gauge ﬁxing term) one can see that
in this case

f (p, q) = O(α0, λ2

0);

Fµ(p, q) = O(α0, λ2

Gc(q) = 1 + O(α0, λ2

This implies that in the tree approximation F = 1, Fµ = 0, and f = 0. The other functions are
constructed in a similar way.

Substituting the expressions (37) into Eqs. (35) and (36) it can be easily veriﬁed that the
Slavnov–Taylor identities are really valid in this approximation. The one-loop veriﬁcation of
these identities will be presented below.

4 Non-renormalization of the V ¯cc vertices

In order to prove the non-renormalization theorem for the V ¯cc-vertices we ﬁrst consider the
structure of quantum corrections to the function H(p, q) which is deﬁned by Eq. (33). These
quantum corrections are given by diagrams in which one leg corresponds to the chiral source

2For simplicity, we use the compact notation Gc(−q2/Λ2) → Gc(q). Also it should be noted that the scalar

products of vectors are constructed using the Minkowski metric with the signature (+ − −−).

J and two other legs correspond to the chiral ghost superﬁelds c. Let us consider an arbitrary
supergraph of this type (with an arbitrary number of loops) and denote the vertex containing
the source J by y. This vertex also contains the product of two ghost propagators with y chiral
ends (their antichiral ends we denote by the subscripts 1 and 2):

(40)

(This structure of the vertex follows from Eq. (29).) Using the standard technique for calculating
supergraphs [67, 68] we see that the considered contribution to the eﬀective action is given by
an integral over the whole superspace. In particular, this implies that it includes integration
over d4θ. From the other side, any loop correction to the considered correlator is presented in
the form of the ﬁrst term of Eq. (31). Taking into account that

Z d4θ = −

1

2Z d2θ ¯D2 + total derivatives in the coordinate space,

(41)

we obtain that two left spinor derivatives should act to the external lines. However, the external
lines are chiral. Therefore, according to the standard rules for supergraph calculating, a non-
trivial result can be obtained only if two right spinor derivatives also act to the external lines.
Thus, we conclude that the result should be proportional to, at least, the second degree of the
external momenta. Therefore, the corresponding integrals are proportional to Λ−2 and do not
contain ultraviolet divergencies. This implies that the function H(p, q) is UV ﬁnite. (Due to the
renormalizability, the UV subdivergencies are also absent if the function H is written in terms of
the renormalized coupling constants.) Below we will demonstrate the ﬁniteness of the function
H(p, q) by the explicit calculation in the one-loop approximation.

Let us construct the renormalization constant Zc which is deﬁned so that the renormalized

Green function

(Gc)R(α, λ, q2/µ2) = lim
Λ→∞

Zc(α, λ, Λ/µ) Gc(α0, λ0, q2/Λ2)

(42)

is ﬁnite in the UV region. Here µ is the renormalization point, α and λ are the renormalized
coupling and Yukawa constants, respectively. By construction, (Gc)R does not depend on the
parameter Λ in the higher covariant derivative term.

In order to prove the non-renormalization of the V ¯cc-vertex we multiply the Slavnov–Taylor
identity (35) by the renormalization constant Zc, and express both sides of this equation in terms
of the renormalized coupling constants. After this, we make the diﬀerentiation with respect to
ln Λ at ﬁxed values of the renormalized coupling constants and take the limit Λ → ∞. Due to
the ﬁniteness of the renormalized ghost two-point Green function (Gc)ren and of the function H
(expressed in terms of the renormalized coupling constants) the right hand side vanishes and we
obtain

(cid:16)(Gc)R(q)

d

d ln Λ

F (p, q)(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Λ→∞

Next, we set in this equation p = −q and take into account that the function Gc depends only
on the squared momentum. Therefore,

= 0.

(43)

where the derivative with respect to ln Λ should be calculated at ﬁxed values of the renormalized
coupling and Yukawa constants. Because the function F (−q, q) depends only on ln(Λ2/q2), we

conclude that it is ﬁnite. Therefore, the corresponding renormalization constant (see below) is
ﬁnite. As a consequence, the function F (p, q) is also ﬁnite.

Terms in the eﬀective action corresponding to the Green function (27) have the form

(45)

Writing this expression in terms of the renormalized values according to Eq. (18) we conclude
that the renormalized function F is given by

FR(p, q) = Z −1/2

α

ZcZV F (p, q).

(46)

Note that deriving this equation we take into account the presence of the bare coupling constant
e0 in Eq. (45). Similar equations can be also written for the functions f (p, q) and Fµ(p, q). From
Eq. (46) we see that the ﬁniteness of the function F leads to the relation

d

(47)

Although the renormalization constants are not uniquely deﬁned, it is possible to choose the
subtraction scheme in which

−

ln Zα + ln Zc + ln ZV = 0.

(48)

Finally, we note that the renormalization constants for all 4 vertices of the type V ¯cc, i.e.,
proportional to ¯c[V, c], ¯c+[V, c], ¯c[V, c+], and ¯c+[V, c+] are the same. Therefore, ﬁniteness of the
vertex ¯c+[V, c], which was proved above, leads to ﬁniteness of the other vertices. Certainly, this
is a consequence of the renormalizability of N = 1 gauge supersymmetric theories.

5 One-loop veriﬁcation

It is desirable to verify the proof made in the previous section using a rather complicated
technique by explicit calculations in the lowest loops.
In this section we make such a veriﬁ-
cation in the one-loop approximation. Namely, in the considered approximation we calculate
the Faddeev-Popov ghost two-point function Gc, the three-point ¯c V c-vertices, and the Green
functions (30). Next, we check the Slavnov–Taylor identities (verifying, thereby, correctness of
the calculation) and demonstrate ﬁniteness of the function H and ¯c V c-vertices.

The function Gc(p) is deﬁned by Eq. (21) so that in the tree approximation Gc = 1. The
one-loop correction to this function is determined by two diagrams presented in Fig. 2. Having
calculated these diagrams we obtained

where Rk ≡ R(k2/Λ) and Kk ≡ K(k2/Λ2). This expression is written in the Euclidean space
after the Wick rotation as function of the Euclidean momentum pµ with p4 = −ip0. From
the expression (49) we see that the considered function is divergent in the ultraviolet region
(for inﬁnite Λ). Certainly, for ﬁnite Λ the integral is UV ﬁnite due to the higher derivatives
in the denominator (inside the functions R and K). It is should be noted that the integral is
divergent in the IR region. Such divergences are well-known [62]. Usually, they are regularized
by the substitution k2 → k2 + m2, where m is a small dimensionful parameter. However, in this
paper we are interested only in the ultraviolet divergences and will ignore the infrared eﬀects.
It is suﬃcient to point out that well-deﬁned expressions can be obtained by diﬀerentiating with
respect to ln Λ and taking the limit Λ → ∞:

The three-point V ¯cc Green functions in the one-loop approximation are determined by the

results for the functions entering Eqs. (27) and (28). Here we present the results for the functions

From these expressions we see that the considered functions are really ﬁnite in the limit Λ → ∞.
The remaining functions f (p, q) and Fµ(p, q) are also ﬁnite in the one-loop approximation,
because they have the dimensions m−2 and m−1, respectively. The expressions for them are
much larger, and we explicitly write them in the Appendix. Certainly, their ﬁniteness can be
easily seen from the explicit expressions presented there.

In order to verify correctness of the calculations and the general arguments presented in the
previous section it is necessary to check the Slavnov–Taylor identities (35) and (36). Taking into
account the relation between Minkowski and Euclidean scalar products, (aµbµ)M = −(aµbµ)E,
and using the result for the function Fµ(p, q) it is possible to obtain3

Moreover, it is necessary to calculate one-loop contributions to the functions H(p, q) and eH(p, q)

which are deﬁned by Eq. (31). For this purpose we calculate the diagrams presented in Fig. 4.
In these diagrams two external lines correspond to the chiral ghosts superﬁelds c and the double
external line corresponds to the chiral source J . After calculating this graph we obtained that
the sums of the tree and one-loop contributions have the form

We see that the function H is ﬁnite in the ultraviolet region and proportional to the second
degree of external momenta, as it was argued in the previous section.
(Let us remind that
the ultraviolet ﬁniteness of the functions H(p, q) is a key ingredient of V ¯cc-non-renormalization

theorem proof.) The function eH is UV ﬁnite and in the considered approximation does not also

contain IR divergencies. However, the infrared divergences are present in the expression for the
function H. The well-deﬁned expression is obtained after diﬀerentiating with respect to ln Λ (at
ﬁxed values of the renormalized coupling constants) and subsequent taking the limit Λ → ∞:

Using the above expressions one can easily verify the Slavnov–Taylor identities. For example,

in the one-loop approximation Eq. (35) gives

where α0 and λ0 are bare coupling and Yukawa constants, respectively, and the constants en-
tering this equation are deﬁned by

4Let us remind that in Eq. (36) we use Minkowski momentums, while here the momentums are Euclidean.

Thus, due to the identity (aµbµ)M = −(aµbµ)E some signs are diﬀerent.

(62)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)α,λ=const

d ln Zα

d ln Λ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)α,λ=const

Eq. (48) allows relating Zα to the renormalization constants Zc and ZV . Therefore, due to the
non-renormalization theorem for the V ¯cc vertex it is possible to present the β-function (deﬁned
in terms of the bare charges) in the form

β(α0, λ0) = −2α0

d ln(ZcZV )

d ln Λ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)α,λ=const

= 2α0(cid:16)γc(α0, λ0) + γV (α0, λ0)(cid:17),

(63)

where γc and γV are anomalous dimensions of the Faddeev–Popov ghosts and of the quantum
gauge superﬁeld, respectively. Substituting this expression to the right hand side of Eq. (61)
one can rewrite the NSVZ β-function as

β(α0, λ0)

i(α0, λ0)/r(cid:17). (64)

This form seems to be convenient for deriving the NSVZ relation by the direct summation of
Feynman diagrams, because the Faddeev–Popov ghosts and the ordinary matter superﬁelds enter
in the right hand side in a similar way. Moreover, the calculations made in the Abelian case
and for the Adler D-function in N = 1 SQCD reveal the qualitative picture of appearing the
NSVZ expression in the perturbation theory in the case of using the higher covariant derivative
regularization, which is illustrated by Fig. 1. Namely, we start with a graph without external
lines. Then the contribution to the β-function is obtained after calculating all diagrams which
are obtained from the original graph be attaching two external lines of the background gauge
superﬁeld. From the other side, the diagrams corresponding to the right hand side of the
NSVZ relation are obtained by various cutting of the original graph. Certainly, as a result of
this procedure in the non-Abelian case we will obtain diagrams contributing to the anomalous
dimensions of the matter superﬁelds, Faddeev–Popov ghosts, and quantum gauge superﬁeld.
The example is presented in Fig. 5.

Exactly these anomalous dimensions are present in the right hand side of Eq. (64). That
is why we believe that it is Eq. (64) that will be obtained by summing the diagrams in the
perturbation theory. More exactly, taking into account the results of [39], the derivation of the
NSVZ relation in the non-Abelian case for the RG functions deﬁned in terms of the bare charges
should be made by proving the following relation between the Green functions

Certainly, from (65) one can easily obtain the NSVZ relation (59) for the RG functions
deﬁned in terms of the bare coupling constants. It is important that the RG functions deﬁned
in terms of the bare charges are scheme-independent for a ﬁxed regularization [69]. That is why
in the Abelian case Eq. (59) is valid for an arbitrary choice of the renormalization prescription
if the theory is regularized by the higher derivative method [69, 70, 71]. We believe that in
the non-Abelian case Eq. (65) can be also derived using the BRST invariant version of the
higher covariant derivative regularization. However, for RG functions deﬁned in the standard
way in terms of the renormalized coupling constants [72] it is necessary to specify the NSVZ
subtraction scheme. This can be easily done starting from Eq.(65) repeating the argumentation
of Ref.
[69, 70, 71]. In the non-Abelian case the RG functions entering into Eq.(65) deﬁned
in terms of the bare coupling constant coincide with ones deﬁned in terms of the renormalized
coupling constants if the boundary conditions

Zα(α, λ, x0) = 1;

(Zφ)i

j(α, λ, x0) = δi

j;

Zc(α, λ, x0) = 1,

(67)

where x0 is a ﬁxed value of ln Λ/µ, are imposed on the renormalization constants. (For ex-
ample, it is possible and convenient to choose x0 = 0.) Certainly, we also assume that the
renormalization constants satisfy Eq. (19) and the equation

ZV = Z 1/2

α Z −1

c

,

(68)

which follows from the non-renormalization theorem derived in this paper. Thus, Eqs. (67),
(68), and (19) presumably give the NSVZ scheme in the non-Abelian case if the supersymmetric
gauge theory is regularized by the BRST invariant version of the higher covariant derivative

regularization. This prescription is a straightforward generalization of the results of Ref.
[69,
70, 71] for the Abelian case. It should be also noted that in the case of using the dimensional
reduction so far there is no similar prescriptions which works in all orders [73, 74, 75, 76, 77],
although the structures similar to integrals of δ-singularities (which appear with the higher
derivative regularization due to the factorization of loop integrals into integrals of double total
derivatives) were considered [78].

7 Conclusion

In this paper using the Slavnov–Taylor identities we prove that four three-point Green func-
tions corresponding to the ghost-gauge vertices in N = 1 SYM theories with matter are ﬁnite. As
a consequence, one can choose a subtraction scheme in which the corresponding renormalization
constant is equal to 1. (Certainly, ﬁnite renormalizations are also possible.) In principle, this
result can be considered as a non-renormalization theorem. Moreover, in this paper we argue
that it could be useful for deriving the exact NSVZ β-function in the non-Abelian case. Re-
ally, qualitatively, in order to ﬁnd the NSVZ relation we consider a graph without external lines.
Then, attaching two external lines of the background gauge superﬁeld one obtains diagrams con-
tributing to the β-function. From the other hand, cutting the considered graph gives diagrams
contributing to the anomalous dimensions of various ﬁelds, namely, the matter superﬁelds, the
quantum gauge superﬁeld, and the Faddeev–Popov ghosts. The non-renormalization theorem
proved in this paper allows writing the NSVZ β-function in the form of a relation between the
β-function and the anomalous dimensions of these superﬁelds. Thus, we obtain exactly the same
qualitative picture for the origin of the NSVZ relation (for the RG functions deﬁned in terms of
the bare coupling constants) as in the Abelian case. If this picture is correct, the NSVZ scheme
for the RG function deﬁned in terms of the renormalized coupling constants can be constructed
similar to the Abelian case, if the BRST invariant version of the higher covariant derivative
method is used for the regularization.

A Appendix

In this appendix we present one-loop expressions for the functions f (p, q) and Fµ(p, q) deﬁned

One can easily verify that these expressions are ﬁnite in the ultraviolet region, in agreement with
the non-renormalization theorem proved in this paper. However, for these two functions in the
one-loop approximation the result is trivial, because it can be derived from simple dimensional
considerations.
