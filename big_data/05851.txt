Abstract

In a recent paper (arXiv:1505.01475 ) Est´elyi and Pisanski raised a question
whether there exist vertex-transitive Haar graphs that are not Cayley graphs.
In this note we construct an inﬁnite family of trivalent Haar graphs that are
vertex-transitive but non-Cayley. The smallest example has 40 vertices and is the
well-known Kronecker cover over the dodecahedron graph G(10, 2), occurring as
the graph ‘40’ in the Foster census of connected symmetric trivalent graphs.

Keywords: Haar graph, Cayley graph, vertex-transitive graph.

Introduction

Let G be a group, and S be a subset of G with 1G /∈ S. Then the Cayley graph
Cay(G, S) is is the graph with vertex-set G and with edges of the form {g, sg} for all
g ∈ G and s ∈ S. Equivalently, since all edges can be written in the form {1, s}g,
this is a covering graph over a single-vertex graph having loops and semi-edges, with
voltages taken from S : the order of a voltage over a semi-edge is 2 (corresponding to an
involution in S), while the order of voltage over a loop is greater than 2 (corresponding
to a non-involution in S). Note that we may assume S = S −1.

A natural generalisation of Cayley graphs are the so called Haar graphs, introduced
in [14] by Hladnik et al, as follows. A dipole is a graph with two vertices, say black and
white, and parallel edges (each from the white vertex to the black vertex), but no loops.
Given a group G and an arbitrary subset S of G, the Haar graph H(G, S) is the regular
G-cover of a dipole with |S| parallel edges, labeled by elements of S. In other words, the
vertex-set of H(G, S) is G × {0, 1}, and the edges are of the form {(g, 0), (sg, 1)} for all
g ∈ G and s ∈ S. If it is not ambiguous, we use the notation (x, 0) ∼ (y, 1) to indicate
an edge {(x, 0), (y, 1)} of H(G, S). The name ‘Haar graph’ comes from the fact that
when G is an abelian group, the Schur norm of the corresponding adjacency matrix can
be easily evaluated via the so-called Haar integral on G (see [13]).

Note that the group G acts on H(G, S) as a group of automorphisms, by right
multiplication, and moreover, G acts regularly on each of the two parts of H(G, S),
namely {(g, 0) : g ∈ G} and {(g, 1) : g ∈ G}. Conversely, if Γ is any bipartite graph and
its automorphism group Aut Γ has a subgroup G that acts regularly on each part of Γ,
then Γ is a Haar graph — indeed Γ is isomorphic to H(G, S) where S is determined by
the edges incident with a given vertex of Γ.

Haar graphs form a special subclass of the more general class of bi-Cayley graphs,
which are graphs that admit a semiregular group of automorphisms with two orbits of
equal size. Every bi-Cayley graph can be realised as follows. Let L and R be subsets
of a group G such that L = L−1, R = R−1 and 1 /∈ L ∪ R, and let S be any subset of
G. Now take a dipole with edges labelled by elements of S, and add |L| loops to the
white (or ‘left’) vertex and label these by elements of L, and similarly add |R| loops
to the black (or ‘right’) vertex and label these by elements of R. This is a voltage
graph, and the bi-Cayley graph BCay(G, L, R, S) is its regular G-cover. The vertex-set
of BCay(G, L, R, S) is G × {0, 1}, and the edges are of three forms: {(g, 0), (lg, 0)} for
l ∈ L, {(g, 1), (rg, 1)} for r ∈ R, and {(g, 0), (sg, 1)} for s ∈ S, for all g ∈ G. Note that
the Haar graph H(G, S) is exactly the same as the bi-Cayley graph BCay(G, ∅, ∅, S).

Recently bi-Cayley graphs (and Haar graphs in particular) have been investigated
by several authors — see [8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 28], for example.
It is known that every Haar graph over an abelian group is a Cayley graph (see [21]).
More precisely, if A is an abelian group, then a Haar graph over A is a Cayley graph
over the corresponding generalised dihedral group D(A), which is the group generated
by A and the automorphism of A that inverts every element of A (see [24]). The authors
of [14] considered only cyclic Haar graphs — that is, Haar graphs H(G, S) where G is
a cyclic group. In [9], the second and third authors of this paper extended the study
of Haar graphs to those over non-abelian groups, and found some that are not vertex-
transitive, and some others that are Cayley graphs. The existence of Haar graphs that
are vertex-transitive but non-Cayley remained open, and led to the following question.

Problem 1. Is there a non-abelian group G and a subset S of G such that the Haar
graph H(G, S) is vertex-transitive but non-Cayley?

In this note we give a positive answer to the above question, by exhibiting an inﬁnite
family of trivalent examples, coming from a family of double covers of generalised Pe-
tersen graphs. These graphs, which we denote by D(n, r) for any integers n and r with

2

n ≥ 3 and 0 < r < n, are described in Section 2. They have been considered previously
by other authors (as we explain); in particular, by a theorem of Feng and Zhou [28], it is
known exactly which of the graphs D(n, r) are vertex-transitive, and which are Cayley.
Then in Section 3 we determine necessary and suﬃcient conditions for D(n, r) to be a
Haar graph, and this provides the answer in Section 4.

2 The graphs D(n, r) and their properties

Let G(n, r) be the generalised Petersen graph on 2n vertices with span r. By D(n, r)
we denote a double cover of G(n, r), in which the edges get non-trivial voltage if and
only if they belong to the ‘inner rim’ (see below). This gives a class of graphs that
was introduced by Zhou and Feng [27] under the name of double generalised Petersen
graphs, and studied recently also by Kutnar and Petecki [20]. In both [27] and [20], the
notation DP (n, r) was used for the graph D(n, r). But it is easy for us to deﬁne the
vertices and edges of the graph D(n, r) explicitly.

There are four types of vertices, called ui, vi, wi and zi (for i ∈ Zn), and three types

of edges, given by the sets

Ω = {{ui, ui+1}, {zi, zi+1} : i ∈ Zn}
Σ = {{ui, vi}, {wi, zi} : i ∈ Zn}
I = {{vi, wi+r}, {vi, wi−r} : i ∈ Zn}

(the ‘outer’ edges),
(the ‘spokes’), and
(the ‘inner’ edges).

This speciﬁcation makes it easy to see that each D(n, r) a special tetracirculant [11],
which is a cyclic cover Σ0(n, a, k, b) over the voltage graph given in Figure 1. To see
this, simply take a = b = 1 and k = 2r, and then D(n, r) ∼= Σ0(n, 1, 2r, 1).

We now give some of other properties of the graphs D(n, r).

Proposition 1. Every D(n, r) is connected.

Proof. Clearly all of the ui lie in the same component as each other, as do all the zj.
Next, all the vi lie in the same component as the ui, and similarly, all the wj lie in the
same component as the zj. Finally, there are edges between the vertices vi and some of
the wj, and this makes the whole graph connected.

Proposition 2. The graph D(n, r) is bipartite if and only if n is even.

Proof. If n is odd, then the vertices ui lie in a cycle of odd length, and so the graph is
not bipartite. On the other hand, if n is even, then the graph is bipartite, with one part
containing the vertices ui and wi±r for even i and the vertices vj and zj±r for odd j.

3

We now consider automorphisms of the graphs D(n, r). Some automorphisms are

apparent from the deﬁnition, such as these, which were noted in [20]:

α :

β :

γ :

ui 7→ ui+1,
ui 7→ zi,
ui 7→ u−i,

vi 7→ vi+1, wi 7→ wi+1,
vi 7→ wi,
vi 7→ v−i,

wi 7→ vi,
wi 7→ w−i,

zi 7→ zi+1
zi 7→ ui
zi 7→ z−i

(rotation),

(ﬂip symmetry),

(reﬂection).

Immediately we obtain the following:

Proposition 3. The automorphism group of the graph D(n, r) has at most two orbits
on vertices, namely the set of all ui and all zj, and the set of all vi and all wj.

Note also that α and β commute with each other. In fact, Zhou and Feng [27] proved
that D(n, r) is isomorphic to the bi-Cayley graph BCay(G, R, L, {1}) over the abelian
group G = hα, βi ∼= Zn × Z2, and R = {α, α−1} and L = {αrβ, α−rβ}.

Next, we consider isomorphisms among the graphs G(n, r) and D(n, r).

Proposition 4. For every n and r, the graph D(n, r) is isomorphic to D(n, n−r), and
D(2n, r) is isomorphic to D(2n, n−r).

Proof. First, the graphs D(n, r) ∼= D(n, n−r) because G(n, r) is identical to G(n, n−r).
For the second part, consider a 180 degree rotation of the two ‘inner’ layers, namely
wi 7→ wi+n and zi 7→ zi+n for all i. This shows that D(2n, r) is isomorphic to D(2n, n+r),
and then applying the ﬁrst part gives D(2n, r) ∼= D(2n, 2n − (n+r)) = D(2n, n−r).

Here we note that it can happen that the graphs D(n, r) and D(n, s) are diﬀerent
when G(n, r) is isomorphic to G(n, s). For instance, G(7, 2) is isomorphic to G(7, 3) but
D(7, 2) is not isomorphic to D(7, 3), since D(7, 3) is planar but D(7, 2) is not.

Also we have the following:

Proposition 5. For every r, the graph D(2r + 1, r) is planar, and isomorphic to the
generalised Petersen graph G(4r+2, 2).

Proof. To see that D(2r + 1, r) is planar, ﬁrst note that since r is coprime to 2r + 1,
the edges between the vertices vi and wj give a cycle of length 2(2r + 1), namely
(v0, w−r, v1, w1−r, v2, w2−r, . . . , v−2, wr−1, v−1, wr). Now draw three concentric circles,
with the middle one for this 2(2r + 1)-cycle, the inside one for the (2r + 1)-cycle
(u0, u1, . . . , u2r), and the outside one for the (2r + 1)-cycle (z0, z1, . . . , z2r), in a con-
sistent order, and then add the spoke edges {ui, vi} and {wi, zi} in the natural way.
In the resulting planar drawing of D(2r + 1, r), there is an inner face of length 2r + 1
(with the ui as vertices), then two layers of pentagonal faces (bounded by cycles of the
form (ui, vi, wi−r, vi+1, ui+1) and (vj, wj+r, zj+r, zj−r, wj−r)), and an outer face of length
2r+1 (with the zj as vertices). After doing this, it is also easy to see that D(2r+1, r) is
isomorphic to the generalised Petersen graph G(4r+2, 2), with the spoke edges joining
vertices of the large 2(2r + 1)-cycle (on the vertices vi and wj) to the two (2r + 1)-cycles
(on the vertices ui and vertices zj respectively).

4

In particular, the graph D(5, 2) is isomorphic to the dodecahedral graph G(10, 2),

and hence D(5, 2) is vertex-transitive. But as we will see, it is not a Haar graph.

Finally in this section, we consider the questions of which of the graphs D(n, r)
are vertex-transitive, and which are Cayley (or equivalently, for which Aut(D(n, r))
has a subgroup that acts regularly on vertices). Recall that Aut(D(n, r)) has at most
two orbits on vertices, and just one when (n, r) = (5, 2). The complete picture was
determined by Feng and Zhou in [28, Theorem 1.3], as follows:

Theorem 6. The graph D(n, r) is vertex-transitive if and only if n = 5 and r = ±2, or n
is even and r2 ≡ ±1 mod n
2 . In the ﬁrst case, D(n, r) is isomorphic to the dodecahedral
graph G(10, 2), which is non-Cayley, and in the second case, if r2 ≡ 1 mod n
2 then
D(n, r) is a Cayley graph, while if r2 ≡ −1 mod n

2 then D(n, r) is non-Cayley.

3 The graphs D(n, r) as Haar graphs

Recall that a Haar graph is a regular cover of a dipole, and also a bi-Cayley graph. Also
we have the following, proved in a diﬀerent way in [9, Proposition 5]:

Proposition 7. A Cayley graph is a Haar graph if and only if it is bipartite.

Proof. Let Γ be a Cayley graph, say for a group K. Then K acts on Γ as a group of
automorphisms, and acts regularly on the vertices of Γ. Now if Γ is a Haar graph, then
by deﬁnition Γ is bipartite. Conversely, suppose Γ is bipartite. Then the subgroup G
of K preserving each of the two parts of Γ has index 2 in K, and acts regularly on each
part, so Γ is a Haar graph (by the argument given in the Introduction).

We can now prove our main theorem:

Theorem 8. D(n, r) is a Haar graph if and only if it is vertex-transitive and n is even.

Proof. First, we note that D(n, r) is bipartite if and only if n is even, by Proposition 2,
and hence we may suppose that n is even, and then show that under that assumption,
D(n, r) is a Haar graph if and only if it is vertex-transitive.

One direction is easy. Suppose Γ = D(n, r) is a Haar graph, say H(G, S). Then
by the deﬁnition of a Haar graph given in the Introduction, the subgroup GR of Aut Γ
induced by G has two orbits on vertices, namely the two parts of the bipartition of Γ.
On the other hand, by Proposition 3, all the vertices ui lie in the same orbit of Aut Γ;
and then since these vertices lie in both parts of Γ, it follows that Aut Γ has a single
orbit on vertices. Thus Γ is vertex-transitive.

For the converse, suppose that Γ = D(n, r) is vertex-transitive, and let m = n

2 . Then
by Theorem 6, we know that r2 ≡ ±1 mod m. Also by Proposition 4 we may suppose
that 0 < r < m, and further, we may suppose that r is odd, because if r is even then
m is odd, and then by Proposition 4 we can replace r by m − r. We now proceed by
considering separately the two cases r2 ≡ ±1 mod m.

5

Case (a): Suppose that r2 ≡ 1 mod m. Then by Theorem 6, we know that D(n, r)
is a Cayley graph, and also since it is bipartite, it follows from Proposition 7 that it is
a Haar graph as well.

Case (b): Suppose that r2 ≡ −1 mod m. In this case we construct a group of auto-
morphisms of D(n, r) that acts regularly on each part of D(n, r). To do this, we take
the automorphism α from the previous section, given by

α : ui 7→ ui+1, vi 7→ vi+1, wi 7→ wi+1, zi 7→ zi+1,

and then take an additional automorphism δ, given by

δ : ui 7→ vri+1, vi 7→ uri+1, wi 7→ zri+1, zi 7→ wri+1
δ : ui 7→ wri+1, vi 7→ zri+1, wi 7→ uri+1, zi 7→ vri+1
or

if m is odd and i is even,
if m is odd and i is odd,

δ : ui 7→ vri+1, vi 7→ uri+1, wi 7→ zri+m+1, zi 7→ wri+m+1
δ : ui 7→ wri+1, vi 7→ zri+1, wi 7→ uri+m+1, zi 7→ vri+m+1

if m is even and i is even,
if m is even and i is odd.

It is a straightforward exercise to verify that δ preserves the edge-set Ω ∪ Σ ∪ I of
D(n, r), and also preserves the two parts of D(n, r), given in the proof of Proposition 2.
To do the former, it is important to note that r2 ≡ 1 mod 4 (because r is odd), and
hence that r2 ≡ −1 mod n when m is odd, while r2 ≡ m−1 mod n when m is even. For
example, if m and i are even then {vi, wi+r}δ = {uri+1, ur(i+r)+m+1} = {uri+1, uri}.

It is also easy to see that conjugation by δ takes α2 to α2r, and so the subgroup G of
Aut(D(n, r)) generated by α2 and δ is isomorphic to the semi-direct product Zm ⋊r Z4.
In particular, G has order 4m = 2n. Also G acts transitively and hence regularly on
each of the two parts of D(n, r), and therefore D(n, r) is a Haar graph.

4 Vertex-transitive Haar graphs that are not Cayley

graphs

Combining Theorems 6 and 8, we have the following, in answer to Problem 1:

Theorem 9.

(a) If n is odd, or if n is even and r2 6≡ ±1 mod n

2 , then D(n, r) is not a Haar graph,

and is vertex-transitive only when (n, r) = (5, ±2);

(b) If n is even and r2 ≡ 1 mod n
(c) If n is even and r2 ≡ −1 mod n
transitive but not a Cayley graph.

2 , then D(n, r) is a Haar graph and a Cayley graph;
2 , then D(n, r) is a Haar graph and is vertex-

Corollary 10. If m > 2 and r2 ≡ −1 mod m, then D(2m, r) is a Haar graph that is
vertex-transitive but non-Cayley. In particular, there are inﬁnitely many such graphs.

Proof. The ﬁrst part follows immediately from Theorem 9, and the second part follows
from a well known fact in number theory, namely that −1 is a square mod m if and
only if m or m/2 is a product of primes p ≡ 1 mod 4 (see [12, Chapter 6]), or simply by
taking m = r2 + 1 for each integer r ≥ 2.

We discovered the ﬁrst few of these examples during the week of the conference
Geometry and Symmetry, held in 2015 at Veszpr´em, Hungary, to celebrate the 60th
birthdays of K´aroly Bezdek and Egon Schulte.

The smallest of our examples is D(10, 2), of order 40, occurring when m = 5 and
r ≡ ±2 or ±3 mod 10 (noting that m − r = 3 when (m, r) = (5, 2)). This is also the
smallest known Haar graph that is vertex-transitive and non-Cayley. It is a Kronecker
cover over the dodecahedral graph G(10, 2), and is also a double cover over the Desargues
graph G(10, 3). These graphs are illustrated in Figure 2.

Figure 2: The dodecahedral graph G(10, 2), the Desargues graph G(10, 3), and the Haar
graph D(10, 2) ∼= D(10, 3) ∼= F40

The graph D(10, 2) was known by R.M. Foster as early as the late 1930s, and appears
as the graph ‘40’ (alternatively known as ‘F40’) in the Foster Census of connected
symmetric trivalent graphs [7]. It was also studied in [25] by Asia Ivi´c Weiss (the chair
of the Veszpr´em conference), and by Betten, Brinkmann and Pisanski in [1], and Boben,
Gr¨unbaum, Pisanski and ˇZitnik in [2]. It has girth 8, and automorphism group of order
480, and it is not just vertex-transitive, but is also arc-transitive. Moreover, by a very
recent theorem of Kutnar and Petecki [20], the graph D(n, r) is arc-transitive only when
(n, r) = (5, 2) or (10, 2) or (10, 3). This implies that F40 is the only example from the
family of graphs D(n, r) that is arc-transitive but non-Cayley.

In fact, F40 is the smallest vertex-transitive non-Cayley Haar graph, in terms of
both the graph order and the number of edges. We found this by running a Magma [3]
computation to construct all Haar graphs with at most 40 vertices or at most 60 edges,
with a check for which of the graphs are vertex-transitive but non-Cayley. Incidentally,
this computation shows that there are 60 diﬀerent examples of order 40, with valencies
running between 3 and 17, but just one of valency 3, namely F40.

Finally, there are many other examples of vertex-transitive non-Cayley Haar graphs
that are not of the form D(n, r), including 3-valent examples of orders 80, 112, 120 and
128, and higher-valent examples of orders 48, 64, 72, 78 and 80. Among the 3-valent

7

examples, many are arc-transitive, including the graphs F80 and F640 in the Foster
census [7] and its extended version in [5, 6], and others in the ﬁrst author’s complete set
of all arc-transitive trivalent graphs of order up to 10000 described on his website [4].
Most of these ‘small’ examples are abelian regular covers of F40, of orders 1280, 2560,
3240, 5000, 5120, 6480, 6720, 9720 and 10000, and are 3-arc-regular, but two others are
2-arc-regular of type 22, with orders 6174 and 8064, and these are abelian regular covers
of the Pappus graph (F18) and the Coxeter graph (F28) respectively.
