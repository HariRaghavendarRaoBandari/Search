ABSTRACT

Context. The new Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) mission provides high-resolution observations of UV spectra and
slit-jaw images (SJIs). These data has become available for investigating the dynamic features in the transition region (TR) below the
on-disk ﬁlaments.
Aims.The driver of “counter-streaming” ﬂows along the ﬁlament spine is still unknown yet. The magnetic structures and the upﬂows
at the footpoints of the ﬁlaments, and their relations with the ﬁlament mainbody have not been well understood. We study the dynamic
evolution at the footpoints of ﬁlaments in order to ﬁnd some clues for these unsolved questions.
Methods. Using UV spectra and SJIs from the IRIS, and coronal images and magnetograms from the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO), we present the new features in a quiescent ﬁlament channel: subarcsecond bright points (BPs) and quasi-periodic upﬂows.
Results. The BPs in the TR have a spatial scale of about 350−580 km and lifetime of more than several tens of minutes. They are
located at stronger magnetic structures in the ﬁlament channel, with magnetic ﬂux of about 1017−1018 Mx. Quasi-periodic brightenings
and upﬂows are observed in the BPs and the period is about 4−5 min. The BP and the associated jet-like upﬂow comprise a “tadpole-
shaped” structure. The upﬂows move along bright ﬁlament threads and their directions are almost parallel to the spine of the ﬁlament.
The upﬂows initiated from the BPs with opposite polarity magnetic ﬁelds have opposite directions. The velocity of the upﬂows in
plane of sky is about 5−50 km s−1. The emission line of Si IV 1402.77 Å at the locations of upﬂows exhibits obvious blueshifts of
about 5−30 km s−1, and the line proﬁle is broadened with the width of more than 20 km s−1.
Conclusions. The BPs seem to be the bases of ﬁlament threads and the upﬂows are able to convey mass for the dynamic balance
of the ﬁlament. The “counter-streaming” ﬂows in previous observations may be caused by the propagation of bi-directional upﬂows
initiated from opposite polarity magnetic ﬁelds. We suggest that quasi-periodic brightenings of BPs and quasi-periodic upﬂows result
from small-scale oscillatory magnetic reconnections, which are modulated by solar p-mode waves.

1. Introduction

Quiescent ﬁlaments are large structures of cool and dense plasma
embedded in the surrounding hotter corona of quiet regions.
Despite over a century of observations, a big question still re-
mains: how the ﬁlament plasma forms and evolves. It is recog-
nized that the ﬁlament material should come from the chromo-
sphere, rather than the rareﬁed corona (Pikel’Ner 1971; Saito &
Tandberg-Hanssen 1973). Several models have been proposed
to explain the formation process of ﬁlament material. In injec-
tion models, chromospheric plasma is propelled directly into the
corona through the reconnection of magnetic ﬁeld during cancel-
ing ﬂux (Wang 1999; Chae et al. 2001; Litvinenko et al. 2007).
Levitation models propose that cool plasma is lifted by ﬂux rope
emergence from below the photosphere or post-reconnection re-
laxation associated with ﬂux cancellation (van Ballegooijen &
Martens 1989; Priest et al. 1996). In evaporation-condensation
models, chromospheric plasma is evaporated due to thermal non-
equilibrium and ultimately condensed in the corona to form cool
ﬁlament threads (Karpen et al. 2005; Xia et al. 2012; Liu et al.
2012; Berger et al. 2012). The dynamic evolution at the foot-
points of the ﬁlaments could provide important information for
our understanding of the formation mechanism of the ﬁlaments
(Parenti 2014; Li et al. 2015).

Bright points (BPs) are ubiquitous small-scale bright dynam-
ical features at various atmosphere layers. BPs are frequently
observed in X-rays and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths
and correspond to coronal bright points (CBPs). The spatial sizes
of CBPs are around 5−20′′ and their lifetime ranges from sev-
eral hours to 2 days (Vaiana et al. 1973; Golub et al. 1974; Li et
al. 2013). CBPs are often located at network magnetic features
of opposite polarity, with the total ﬂuxes of about 1019−1020
Mx (Golub et al. 1976; Hong et al. 2014). The observations
showed that some CBPs are associated with quasi-periodic im-
pulsive ﬂashes, with periods of a few minutes to hours (Habbal
et al. 1990; Ning & Guo 2014; Samanta et al. 2015). Some au-
thors suggest that small-scale repeated magnetic reconnections
result in the quasi-periodic variation in the intensity of CBPs
(Madjarska et al. 2003; Doyle et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2012).
Recently, R´egnier et al. (2014) reported the existence of subarc-
second EUV bright dots at the edge of the active region with a
characteristic length of 680 km from observations of the High-
resolution Coronal (Hi-C) instrument. The bright dots are short-
lived (25 s) and appear at the footpoints of large-scale coronal
loops. Tian et al. (2014a) found similar subarcsecond bright dots
above sunspots in the transition region (TR) with the observa-
tions of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS; De
Pontieu et al. 2014).

Å and SDO/HMI LOS magnetogram showing the subarcsecond
BPs underlying the ﬁlament and bi-directional (red and white ar-

(white square).

The majority of previous observations about ﬁlaments were
taken in Hα and EUV wavelengths, and the dynamical fea-
tures below the on−disk ﬁlaments could not be seen as a
result of the abundant Lyman continuum absorption and the
“volume−blocking” eﬀect (Wang et al. 1998; Heinzel et al.
2001). The recently launched IRIS mission is now providing
high-resolution observations of the TR and the chromosphere.
The slit-jaw images (SJIs) from the IRIS are centered at 1330,
1400, 2796 and 2832 Å (De Pontieu et al. 2014). The ﬁlaments
seem semitransparent and optically thin in the channels of 1330
and 1400 Å and the dynamic evolution at the footpoints of the ﬁl-
aments could be seen. Thus in this work we investigate the small-
scale activities at the footpoints of the ﬁlament in the TR by
combining imaging and spectroscopic observations of the IRIS
and try to ﬁnd some clues to the material source of the ﬁlaments.
Here, new dynamical features in the TR below the quiescent ﬁla-
ments are found: subarcsecond BPs and quasi-periodic upﬂows.
We investigate the physical properties of BPs, the quasi-periodic
patterns of BPs and associated upﬂows.

The IRIS observations were taken from 18:01 UT to 18:45 UT
on 2015 February 13, with the ﬁeld of view (FOV) covering part
of a quiescent ﬁlament in the southern hemisphere. The SJIs cen-
tered at 1330, 1400 and 2796 Å are used to analyze the evolu-
tion of BPs, with 0′′.33−0′′.4 spatial resolution. The observa-
tions have a long exposure time of 15 s and a temporal cadence
of ∼ 66 s. The spectral data are taken in a 8−step raster mode
with a step cadence of 16.4 s and a spectral dispersion of ∼0.025
Å pixel−1. The SJIs at 1330 Å and spectral data of the Si IV
1402.77 Å line are mainly analyzed. The C II 1335.71 Å line
is formed in the lower TR and corresponds to a temperature of
about 2.5×104 K (Li et al. 2014). The Si IV 1402.77 Å line is
formed in the middle TR with a temperature of about 8.0×104
K. The calibrated level 2 data were used in our study. The EUV
observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA;
Lemen et al. 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) are used to compare with the IRIS
data. Cross-correlation between the AIA 1600 Å image and the
IRIS SJI 1400 Å image was used for the coalignment (Tian et
al. 2014b). The full-disk line-of-sight magnetograms from the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012)
are also applied to analyze the magnetic structures at the BPs.

3. Results

The large-scale quiescent ﬁlament stretches across the solar
southern hemisphere, with a length of ∼1000 Mm (Figure 1a).
The middle part of the ﬁlament is covered by the FOV of the
IRIS (148′′×148′′). In the zoomed 171 Å image (Figure 1b), sev-
eral bright thread-like structures were observed along the spine
of the ﬁlament. At the bases of these threads, a few grain-like
knots could be obscurely seen. High-resolution observations of
1330 and 1400 Å clearly showed several tens of small-scale BPs
underlying the ﬁlament (Figures 1c-d). These BPs are mainly
located at two areas below the ﬁlament (regions “R1” and “R2”
in Figure 1c). Most of the BPs in regions “R1” and “R2” are
respectively located at opposite polarity magnetic ﬁelds (Figure
1e). We have selected 22 relatively isolated BPs in the two re-
gions and obtain the intensity-location proﬁles along the slices
that pass through the centers of the BPs. Then the Gaussian func-
tion is used to ﬁt the proﬁles and the full width at half maximum
(FWHW) of the Gaussian ﬁtting proﬁle is thought to be the spa-
tial size of each BP. The average size of these BPs is 440 km
(about 4 pixels), with the maximum value of 580 km and the
minimum value of 350 km. Most of the BPs always exist during
the observational time interval, and this means that their life-
times are at least tens of minutes.

The BPs seem to be connected with loop-like structures, ap-
pearing as the morphology of “tadpoles”. At region “R1”, the
directions of the loop-like structures are roughly parallel to the
spine of the ﬁlament, pointing from the BPs to the northwest
(Figures 2b and 2e). The comparison of the IRIS and AIA im-
ages suggests that several loop-like structures at 1330 and 1400
Å could be observed at 171 and 304 Å, corresponding to the
bright EUV threads of the ﬁlament (arrows in Figures 2a-b and
2d-e). The BPs are located at the negative-polarity ﬁelds (Figure
2c) near the polarity inversion line (PIL). Several relatively iso-
lated BPs are deﬁned and their magnetic ﬂux (see white circles
in Figures 2b-c) is calculated. The magnetic ﬂux of these BPs is
between 3.8×1017 Mx and 1.2×1018 Mx, and the average value is
about 7.0×1017 Mx. Signatures of these BPs and loop-like struc-

at the selected locations. The FOV of 1400 Å images is the same
as that of Figure 2. The red, blue and yellow pluses denote the
locations of the upﬂows initiated from the BPs. The green plus in
panel (a) indicates one location without upﬂows. Dotted curves
in right column are the single Gaussian ﬁtting with a parabolic
background of the solid curves.

tures are not very prominent in the chromospheric 2796 Å im-
ages (Figure 2f).

The temporal evolution of some BPs at region “R1” is pre-
sented in Figure 3. Red and white squares in Figure 2(e) re-

spectively denote the FOVs of Figures 3(a)-(d) and 3(e)-(l). We
ﬁnd that the emission intensities of the BPs at 1330 Å vary with
time. At 18:41:56 UT, the intensities of the two BPs (yellow cir-
cles in Figure 3a) were very weak. About 2 min later, the emis-
sions of the two BPs increased by 60% and the mass upﬂows
were simultaneously initiated (Figures 3b-c). The constant up-
ﬂows resulted in the appearance of observed loop-like structures
linked with the BPs. The magnetic ﬁelds at the two BPs are very
weak and could not be clearly discerned (Figure 3d). More dras-
tic events occasionally occurred at the concentration area of the
BPs (Figures 3e-h). At about 18:03 UT, the emission intensity of
the BPs was enhanced and meanwhile the upﬂow occurred with
a projected velocity of about 50 km s−1. Then the intensity of the
upﬂow was decreased at 18:08 UT. About 3 min later, the BPs
and the upﬂow were activated again. In AIA 171 Å images (pan-
els i-j), the outﬂows (e.g., see the “Flow” in panel (f)) could not
be observed. Only the relatively steady EUV threads could be
discerned. At the base of the upﬂow, magnetic ﬂux cancellation
of the strong negative polarity ﬁelds with the nearby small-scale
positive polarity ﬁelds was observed (Figures 3k-l).

The appearance of the BPs at region “R2” (Figure 1c) was
shown in Figure 4. The loop-like structures connecting with the
BPs could be observed in the 171 and 1330 Å channels, cor-
responding to the bright EUV threads of the quiescent ﬁlament
(arrows in Figures 4a-b). The direction of the loop-like struc-
tures at this region is roughly towards the southeast, which is
diﬀerent from the loop-like structures at region “R1” (red and
white arrows in Figure 1c). The BPs are anchored at positive po-
larity ﬁelds and their magnetic ﬂux ranges from 6.9×1017 Mx to
1.4×1018 Mx (Figures 4c-d). The small-scale explosive events
are frequently initiated in close proximity to some BPs. Taking
one BP (Figures 4e-f) as an example, its emission intensity at
1330 Å was suddenly enhanced and meanwhile the bright mate-
rial was ejected from the BP with a velocity of 10 km s−1. The BP
and the associated upﬂow comprise a “tadpole-like” morphol-
ogy. At 18:20:04 UT, the upﬂow at another BP appeared (Figure
4g). The magnetogram showed that extremely weak negative po-

larity ﬁelds seemed to exist nearby the main positive polarity
ﬁelds (Figure 4h).

In order to analyze the kinematic evolution of the upﬂows at
1330 Å in detail, we obtain the stack plots (Figures 5a-d) along
four diﬀerent straight lines (“A−B” and “C−D” in Figure 2b;
“E−F” and “G−H” in Figure 4b). The stack plots show multi-
ple moving intensity features, with each strip representing the
propagating upﬂow. The velocity of the upﬂows initiated from
the BPs was about 5−14 km s−1. The emission of the BPs and
the appearance of upﬂows are intermittent, and indeed some-
what periodic. The upﬂows seemed to appear each time when
the emission intensity of the BP was enhanced. The vertical sum
of the intensity in area “A1” (two dashed lines in Figure 5a) was
shown in Figure 5(e). The intensity of the BP exhibited a quasi-
periodic pattern, with an average period of about 5.2 min. The
peak intensity of the BP was about 1.4 times as high as the val-
ley intensity. The upﬂows associated with the brightenings of
BPs also occurred periodically. In the stack plot at region “R2”
(Figure 5d), we select the intensity variation at location “L1” to
obtain the period of the upﬂows. Location “L1” is far away from
the north BPs and thus the intensity variation of the BPs is not
aﬀecting the measured intensity of the upﬂows. Also, several up-
ﬂows could be clearly detected at this location. It shows that the
period of the upﬂows was about 3.9 min (black curve in Figure
5f).

Figure 6 shows the proﬁles of Si IV 1402.77 Å line at lo-
cations of the upﬂows from the BPs. We are interested mostly
in the main component of the line, including the line shift and
the line width. Therefore we add a parabolic background in the
single Gaussian ﬁt just to account for the wing emission. The
FWHW of the ﬁtting proﬁle is thought to be the line width (Peter
et al. 2014). The recurrent upﬂows generated from the same BP
have diﬀerent Doppler shifts and line widths. At 18:02:17 UT,
the emission proﬁle at the notable upﬂow (yellow plus in Figure
6a) was blueshifted by ∼14 km s−1, with the Doppler width of
about 40 km s−1 (Figures 6b-c). For the use of a single Gaussian
function with a parabolic background, the ﬁtting proﬁle at this
location (yellow dotted line in panel c) looks asymmetric and
shows a blue-wing excess. One can have used also a Gaussian
function for the extended wings (Peter 2000), but in the present
case the parabolic ﬁt works as well. The inclusion of a second
broad component can also have an impact on the shift of the
main component. The broad component that we account for by
the parabolic background could be, i.e. that some further high-
velocity component is present (indicating jets or whatever; see
Peter 2001, 2010), but this contributes less to the emission than
the main component of the spectrum. The emission intensity
of the second upﬂow at the same location was decreased by
40% at 18:06:40 UT (yellow pluses and curves in Figures 6d-
f). However, the blueshift of the second upﬂow reached about
33 km s−1 and the line width was increased by a factor of two.
Afterwards, the upﬂows exhibited small blueshifts of 5−7 km
s−1 and had the line width of about 20−30 km s−1 (Figures 6g-i).

4. Summary and Discussion

We ﬁrstly report the observations of subarcsecond BPs underly-
ing a quiescent ﬁlament in the TR by the IRIS on 2015 February
13. The BPs have a spatial scale of about 350−580 km and life-
time of more than several tens of minutes. The dimension of
BPs is similar to those of the EUV bright dots at the edge of the
active region (R´egnier et al. 2014) and the subarcsecond bright
dots in the TR above sunspots (Tian et al. 2014a), however, the
lifetime of BPs is much longer than those of the reported bright

dots (∼25 s). Compared to well-known CBPs, the BPs in the ﬁl-
ament channel are much smaller than CBPs (with a spatial size
of 5−20′′; Vaiana et al. 1973). The subarcsecond BPs and CBPs
are both long-lived and their emission intensities both exhibit the
quasi-periodic variation. In this work, the intensities of BPs have
a period of about 4−5 min, comparable to the minimum period
of CBPs. The BPs are anchored at small-scale magnetic struc-
tures near the PIL and their magnetic ﬂux was about 1017−1018
Mx, almost two orders of magnitude smaller than that of CBPs.
The directions of upﬂows are almost parallel to the spine
of the quiescent ﬁlament. The upﬂows initiated from the BPs
with opposite polarity magnetic ﬁelds have opposite directions
(Figure 1c). The direction of the upﬂows is generally thought
to trace out the connectivity of the magnetic ﬁelds. The bi-
directional upﬂows probably imply the consistent direction of
magnetic ﬁelds along the ﬁlament spine. The ﬁlament is com-
posed of multiple groups of magnetic systems and their direc-
tions are the same, pointing from the northwest to the southeast
(Figure 1). The connectivity between magnetic structures within
the ﬁlament channel is not in any arbitrary pattern, e.g., the posi-
tive magnetic structures in “R2” connect with the southeast neg-
ative ones and the negative magnetic structures in “R1” connect
with the northwest positive ones (Figures 1c and 1e). Martin
(1998) found that the chromospheric ﬁbrils on the two sides of
an Hα ﬁlament had opposite orientations. Sheeley et al. (2013)
reported cellular plumes leaning in opposite directions on the
two sides of a ﬁlament channel based on SDO observations. The
conﬁguration of the upﬂows within the ﬁlament channel in our
work is roughly consistent with those shown in previous studies
and may be an intrinsic feature of the quiescent ﬁlament. The
multiple groups of magnetic systems along the ﬁlament spine
have the same orientation and this magnetic topology is more
stable than the opposite ﬁeld orientations within the ﬁlament due
to the low probability of magnetic reconnection.

The BPs appear to be the bases of ﬁlament threads and the
upﬂows intermittently inject plasma inside the ﬁne threads. Our
observations imply that the source of the ﬁlament material may
be the recurrent upﬂows in the TR. Chae (2003) and Liu et al.
(2005) reported the ﬁndings of Hα jets associated with the ﬁl-
aments and suggested that the frequent injection of ﬂow from
below supplies the mass necessary for the formation of the ﬁl-
aments. In our work, the quasi-periodic upﬂows might be able
to convey mass into the ﬁlament threads, which is consistent
with the injection models that the ﬁlament plasma is lifted from
the lower atmosphere by magnetic reconnection (Wang 1999;
Litvinenko et al. 2007).

Quasi-periodic upﬂows are generated when the intensities of
BPs are enhanced, with the BPs and jet-like upﬂows compos-
ing a morphology of “tadpoles”. The quasi-periodic brightenings
of BPs and appearances of upﬂows might be caused by oscilla-
tory magnetic reconnection (Kankelborg et al. 1997; Gupta &
Tripathi 2015). The recurring time scale of the upﬂows is about
4−5 min, approximately consistent with the period of solar p-
mode waves. This implies that p-mode waves possibly modulate
magnetic reconnections by changing the plasma density near the
reconnection site and induce periodic reconnection of the mag-
netic ﬁelds (Chen & Priest 2006). The brightenings of BPs and
generation of upﬂows are observed each time when the magnetic
reconnection occurs. Recently, Li & Zhang (2015) found quasi-
periodic oscillations of the small-scale substructures within the
ﬂare ribbon with periods of 3-6 min, which is attributed to
quasi-periodic slipping reconnection. The observation of wave-
like pulses in a ﬁlament pillar was presented and simulated by
Schmieder et al. (2013) and Ofman et al. (2015). These waves

have a period of about 300 s, similar to that of quasi-periodic
upﬂows in our event. They interpreted these waves propagat-
ing perpendicular to the ﬁlament magnetic ﬁeld as nonlinear fast
magnetosonic waves in the ﬁlament foot. In this work, the ve-
locity of the upﬂows in plane of sky is about 5−50 km s−1. The
emission line of Si IV 1402.77 Å at the locations of upﬂows
exhibits obvious blueshifts of about 5−30 km s−1, and the line
proﬁle is broadened with the width of more than 20 km s−1. The
Doppler velocities of the repeated upﬂows at the same location
are not constant and change with time. This may be caused by
the diﬀerent energy released during the magnetic reconnection
process. The more energy is released, the higher velocity the up-
ﬂow has.

High-resolution observations showed that ﬁlament threads
had an average width of 0′′.3 (Lin et al. 2005; Li & Zhang
2013), slightly thinner than the spatial scale of subarcsecond
BPs (0′′.48−0′′.8). The plasma in the ﬁlament threads moves
with the magnetic ﬁeld lines in opposite directions, appearing
as “counter-streaming” ﬂows (Zirker et al. 1998; Schmieder et
al. 2010; Alexander et al. 2013). The speed of the “counter-
streaming” ﬂows is about 5−20 km s−1, comparable to that of
quasi-periodic upﬂows at the bases of ﬁlament threads. Until
now, the mass source and triggering mechanism of anti-parallel
ﬂows are still unknown. Chen et al. (2014) suggested that the
Hα counter-streamings in previous observations were caused
by longitudinal oscillations of ﬁlament threads. Our observa-
tions reveal that the upﬂows at the BPs with opposite polarity
magnetic ﬁelds move along the ﬁlament threads in opposite di-
rections. The bi-directional upﬂows travelling from the positive
and negative-polarity footpoints of ﬁlament threads indicate that
the ﬁlament is composed of multiple separate systems of mag-
netic ﬁelds. The “counter-streaming” ﬂows may be caused by
the propagation of bi-directional upﬂows along diﬀerent mag-
netic systems that are initiated at the subarcsecond BPs below
the ﬁlament.
