It is theoretically and experimentally argued that there may exist bubble or toroid-shaped conﬁgu-
rations in some nucleus systems. Based on the isospin-dependent transport model of nucleus-nucleus
collisions, here we propose a method to probe the bubble conﬁguration in nucleus. That is, one
could use the value of π−/π+ ratio especially its kinetic energy distribution in head-on collision at
intermediate energies to probe whether there is bubble conﬁguration or not in projectile and target
nuclei. Due to diﬀerent maximum compressions and the eﬀect of symmetry energy, the value of
π−/π+ ratio in the collision of bubble nuclei is evidently larger than that in the collision of normal
nuclei.

INTRODUCTION

It was argued that a nuclear system may have bubble
conﬁguration [1–3], which is in conﬂict with the general
knowledge that an atomic nucleus is compact. The ques-
tion of the possibility of the existences of exotic bubble
or toroidal conﬁguration of atomic nuclei has long been
discussed for more than 60 years [4–12]. The pioneer
study of the spherical bubble nuclei was made by Wil-
son in 1946 [4]. Twenty years later, based on a liquid
drop model, Siemens and Bethe studied spherical bubble
nuclei [5]. Wong studied known stable nuclei and found
spherical bubbles on the basis of a liquid drop model
plus a shell correction energy [12]. And Moretto et al.
argued that nuclear bubble conﬁguration could be stabi-
lized by the inner vapor pressure [13]. Based on the hy-
drodynamic equations, Borunda and L´opez argued that
the hollow conﬁguration is caused by the liquid-like be-
havior of compressed nuclear matter [14]. The transport
model simulations of nuclear collisions at lower incident
beam energy also point out the possible bubble conﬁg-
uration in nuclear matter [15–20]. And J. Decharg´e et
recently gave stable bubble solutions of some spe-
al.
ciﬁc super-heavy nuclei using the approach of the self-
consistent microscopic Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov calcu-
lations with the eﬀective Gogny interaction [1, 2]. These
results are qualitatively consistent with the studies based
on the liquid drop model using Strutinsky shell correction
method [6, 21] plus the phenomenological shell model po-
tentials [22, 23]. At the time being, the possible proton
bubble conﬁguration of some light nuclei has also been
studied [24].

The probe of the bubble conﬁguration formed in heavy-
ion collisions has recently been argued in Refs. [15–20],
while the hollow conﬁguration of atomic nucleus is in
fact hard to probe [25]. This is the reason why the ex-
istence of bubble nuclei is still in debate. Besides the
possible electronic hyperﬁne conﬁguration measurement
of the nuclear density proﬁle [2, 26, 27], it is necessary
to study whether hollow atomic nuclei exist or not by
other completely diﬀerent methods. Very recently, Naj-
man et al. analyzed the Data from an experiment on the

197Au+197Au reaction at 23 MeV/nucleon and showed
that the exotic nuclear conﬁgurations such as toroid-
shaped objects may exist [25]. This experimental in-
vestigation stimulates further studies on the exotic nu-
clear conﬁgurations theoretically. Based on the isospin-
dependent Boltzmann nuclear transport model, here we
show that the observable π−/π+ ratio in heavy-ion col-
lisions at intermediate energies is very sensitive to the
initial nuclear bubble conﬁguration. In the following, for
the convenience of studying, we use the bubble nucleus
900
274X as projectile and target to collide at a beam energy
of 0.4 GeV/nucleon to show how to probe the nuclear
bubble conﬁguration in nucleus. This example is ﬁcti-
tious, but it could demonstrate the point.

II. THE ISOSPIN-DEPENDENT TRANSPORT

MODEL

In the used isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-
Uhlenbeck (BUU) transport model, nucleon coordinates
in initial colliding nuclei are given by [28]

r = R(x1)1/3; cosθ = 1 − 2x2; φ = 2πx3,

x = rsinθcosφ; y = rsinθsinφ; z = rcosθ.

(1)

Where R is the radius of compact nucleus, x1, x2, x3 are
three independent random numbers (limited to be be-
tween 0 and 1). If there is a spherical bubble with radius
Rbubble in a nucleus, the radius Rb of the nucleus with
bubble conﬁguration is given by conservation of volume

R3

b = R3 + R3

bubble.

(2)

In the present study we let inner bubble radii Rbubble
= R/2, R/3 [11]. Due to the short-range correlations of
nucleons in nucleus, above Fermi momentum, momentum
distribution of nucleon in nucleus exhibits a 1/k4 high-
momentum tail shape [29], the isospin-dependent nucleon
momentum distribution in this study is thus given by

nproton(neutron)(p) = 


A

2Z(2N )
0,

C1,proton(neutron), p ≤ pf ;

· C2
p4 ,

pf < p ≤ λpf ;
p > λpf .

(3)

Where n(p) is nucleon momentum distribution in initial
colliding nucleus, pf is the nuclear Fermi momentum.
λ = pmax/pf , is the factor of maximum momentum of
nucleon relative to the nuclear Fermi momentum. We in
this study let λ = 2 [30]. A, Z, N are the nuclear mass
number, proton number and neutron number, respec-
tively. The C1 and C2 parameters are determined by the
0 n(p)p2dp = 1 and roughly
normalization condition 4π R ∞
20 percent of nucleons with momenta above the nuclear
Fermi momentum [31], i.e., 4π R λpf
n(p)p2dp × 100% =
20%. The 20 percent of nucleons with high momenta are
randomly distributed in the nucleus.

pf

We use the Skyrme-type parametrization for the mean

ﬁeld, which reads [28]

U (ρ) = A(ρ/ρ0) + B(ρ/ρ0)σ.

(4)

Where σ = 1.3, A = -232 MeV accounts for attractive
potential and B = 179 MeV accounts for repulsive. With
these choices, the ground-state compressibility coeﬃcient
of nuclear matter is K = 230 MeV [32]. We let the ki-
netic symmetry-energy (the symmetry energy can be di-
vided into the kinetic symmetry energy and the potential
symmetry energy) be -6.71 MeV [33], and the symmetry-
potential becomes [34]

U n/p

sym(ρ, δ) = 38.31(ρ/ρ0)γ × [±2δ + (γ − 1)δ2],

(5)

 

where δ = (ρn −ρp)/ρ is the isospin asymmetry of nuclear
medium. In the above, we let the value of the symmetry-
energy at saturation density be 31.6 MeV [35, 36]. In the
present study, we let γ = 0.3 [37] for the soft symmetry
energy choice while γ = 1.5 for stiﬀer symmetry energy
choice as comparison.

The in-medium baryon-baryon (BB) elastic cross sec-
tions are factorized as the product of a medium correc-
tion factor and the free baryon-baryon scattering cross
sections [38], i.e.,

sorption are in fact mainly determined by the inelastic
baryon-baryon scattering cross section, the in-medium
correction of the inelastic baryon-baryon scattering cross
section has also to be taken into account. In this model,
for the inelastic baryon-baryon scattering cross section,
we use the form [39]

Before studying how to probe the bubble conﬁgura-
tion in nucleus in heavy-ion collisions, it is instructive
to show the density-evolution in collisions of normal and
bubble nuclei. Shown in Fig. 1 is the evolution of the

on collisions at a beam energy of 0.4 GeV/nucleon with
bubble radii Rbubble = 0, R/2, R/3.
It is clearly seen
that, compared with the collision of normal nuclei, there
is a serious depletion of central density with bubble con-
ﬁgurations in projectile and target nuclei. Shown in
Fig. 2 is the evolution of contour plots of density dis-
tribution in 900
274X head-on collisions at the beam
energy of 0.4 GeV/nucleon in X - Z plane (the beam axis
is in the Z direction). We can see that the maximum
compression-density region (ρ/ρ0 > 1.8) is larger for the
normal nuclei while it is smaller if there are bubble con-
ﬁgurations in nuclei. And the larger the bubble is, the
smaller the maximum compression region is seen. This is
understandable since with bubbles in colliding nuclei, the
collision of the two nuclei becomes two bubble’s collision,
the compression is thus not strong. It is interesting to
see that, if there are larger bubble conﬁgurations in the
colliding nuclei, there is also a bubble conﬁguration in
the formed compression matter. Fig. 3 shows the evolu-
tion of the contour plots of density distribution in X - Y
plane. Again, it is seen that there is larger compression if
there are no bubble conﬁgurations in projectile and tar-
get while the compression is smaller if there are bubble
conﬁgurations in initial colliding nuclei.

Since the bubble conﬁgurations in colliding nuclei af-
fect maximum compression in heavy-ion collisions and
the ratio of π−/π+ is in fact aﬀected by the neutron to
proton ratio of compression matter [40], it is thus natu-
rally to think whether the observable π−/π+ ratio is af-
fected by the bubble conﬁgurations in colliding nuclei or
not. Shown in Fig. 4 is the time evolution of the observ-
able π−/π+ ratio in the 900
274X head-on collisions

value of π−/π+ ratio from the bubble nuclei’s collision is
evidently larger than that from the collisions of normal
nuclei. The eﬀects of bubble conﬁgurations in colliding
nuclei on the value of π−/π+ ratio reach about 23% and
68%, respectively, for Rbubble = R/3, R/2. Because the
size of the compression region from the bubble nuclei’s
collision is smaller than that from the normal nuclei, the
symmetry potential at supra-saturation densities would
have less time to act on nucleons. The eﬀect of the sym-
metry energy at supra-saturation densities is thus smaller
in the collision of the bubble nuclei’s collision. There-

fore neutrons are less repelled by the symmetry potential
at high densities in the collision of bubble nuclei. And
the value of the π−/π+ ratio reﬂects the ratio of neu-
tron number and proton number in dense matter, i.e.,
π−/π+ ≈ (Ndense/Zdense)2 [40], it is not surprising to
see larger value of the π−/π+ ratio in the collision of
bubble nuclei.

Shown in Fig. 5 is the kinetic energy distribution of the
observable π−/π+ ratio in the same collisions as Fig. 4.
It can be seen that, for the energetic pion mesons (mainly
from more denser matter), the eﬀects of the bubble con-
ﬁgurations on the value of π−/π+ ratio reach about 70%
and 300%, respectively, for Rbubble = R/3 and R/2. Such
large bubble eﬀects on the π−/π+ ratio could be used to
probe the bubble conﬁguration in nucleus.

While in fact the eﬀects of the nuclear symmetry en-
ergy on the π−/π+ ratio in the collisions for heavy nu-
clei, especially for super-heavy or hyper-heavy nuclei, are
larger than that for lighter nuclei. This is because the
heavier nuclei generally have large N/Z ratio. Shown in
Fig. 6 is the eﬀects of the symmetry energy on the evo-
lution of the observable π−/π+ ratio in the 900
274X
head-on collisions at the beam energy of 0.4 GeV/nucleon
with bubble radii of Rbubble = 0, R/2, R/3. Because the

274X + 900

4

stiﬀer symmetry energy (γ = 1.5) causes more neutrons
to emit from the formed dense matter in collision and
the neutron-poor dense matter causes a small value of
the π−/π+ ratio [40], as expected, one sees in Fig. 6 the
value of π−/π+ ratio with the stiﬀer symmetry energy (γ
= 1.5) is smaller than that with the soft symmetry en-
ergy (γ = 0.3). Therefore, the eﬀect of the symmetry en-
ergy is one of the largest uncertain factors in probing the
bubble conﬁguration in heavier nuclei by the observable
π−/π+ ratio. Fortunately, the nuclear symmetry energy
at high densities has recently been roughly pinned down,
i.e., a soft symmetry energy is supported by the FOPI
and FOPI-LAND experiments [37].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Based on the isospin-dependent nuclear transport
model at intermediate energies, it is found that the bub-
ble conﬁgurations in colliding nuclei aﬀect maximum
compression in heavy-ion collisions. Compared with the
collision of normal nuclei, there is a serious depletion of
central density with bubble conﬁgurations in projectile
and target nuclei. Since the symmetry energy plays im-
portant role, the observable π−/π+ ratio in heavy-ion
collisions is sensitive to the bubble conﬁgurations in col-
liding nuclei. The ratio of π−/π+, especially its kinetic-
energy distribution, could be used to probe the bubble
conﬁguration in nucleus.

However, the detection of the variation of the value
of the π−/π+ ratio with the size of the bubble de-
pends on the experimental ability of discerning bubble
nucleus. Furthermore, since the variation of the value
of the π−/π+ ratio can be due to other factors (frag-
mentation of participant nuclei, inelastic cross section of
nucleon-nucleon scattering, etc.), from an enhancement
of the value of the π−/π+ ratio, one can not deduce the
existence of bubble conﬁguration in nucleus before reduc-
ing theoretical uncertainties.
