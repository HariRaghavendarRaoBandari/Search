Abstract

To learn about a physical system of interest, experimental results must be able to discriminate

among models. We introduce a geometrical measure to quantify the distance between models for

pseudoscalar-meson photoproduction in amplitude space. Experimental observables, with ﬁnite

accuracy, map to probability distributions in amplitude space, and the characteristic width scale of

such distributions needs to be smaller than the distance between models if the observable data are

going to be useful. We therefore also introduce a method for evaluating probability distributions

in amplitude space that arise as a result of one or more measurements, and show how one can use

this to determine what further measurements are going to be necessary to be able to discriminate

among models.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Nuclear and hadron physics have entered an era of high precision measurements from

often very demanding experiments. In the planning stage, it is important to estimate the

potential impact of a particular set of measurements. High impact experiments are ones

in which there is a large potential for the data to constrain the models of the underlying

physical processes of interest, typically by greatly reducing uncertainties in model parame-

ters. An analysis of nucleon-nucleon scattering data, for example, with advanced statistical

methods [1] allows one to infer the parameters and corresponding errors in nucleon-nucleon

potentials. Statistical methods that are designed to reliably infer parameters from exper-

imental data are, however, not necessarily optimized to estimate the potential impact of

various combinations of possible experiments. In other words, model discrimination often

requires diﬀerent strategies than parameter estimation within models [2–4].

In this paper we lay out a framework that can be used to obtain estimates of the possible

impact of (combinations) of polarization measurements in pseudoscalar-meson photoproduc-
tion from the nucleon (hereafter denoted as γN → M B). Information about the reaction
amplitudes in a particular range of kinematics is the key to discriminating between two

or more models. In imaging systems, the Rayleigh criterion is used to determine whether

two or more light sources can be resolved from each other. We develop an analogue of this

criterion which requires a measure of the distance between models in amplitude space, and

a means of determining the characteristic spread of probability densities in amplitude space

that result from measurement of observables.

Several models for the underlying reaction mechanisms of γN → M B reactions are
available. Some of the most common approaches are the coupled-channel (CC), isobar

and hybrid isobar-Regge models. All of these aim to extract s-channel resonance content

from experimental data. In most cases, model assumptions are required to describe other

contributing mechanisms (referred to as “the background”). After decades of research,

however, the precise underlying resonance content is still under debate, and the list of

known resonances changes with each edition of the Review of Particle Physics [5]. A detailed

knowledge of the reaction amplitudes as a function of kinematical variables should enable one

to discriminate among various reaction models, but it is necessary to perform measurements
of several γN → M B polarization observables to access the reaction amplitudes.

At ﬁxed kinematics, four complex reaction amplitudes determine the γN → M B dynam-
ics. The kinematics are ﬁxed by the invariant mass W and the cosine of the center-of-mass

(c.m.) scattering angle θc.m., and there is a one-to-one relation between (W, cos θc.m.) and

the Mandelstam variables (s, t). It was suggested [6, 7] that a selection of polarization mea-

surements may lead to a situation where all reaction amplitudes are known to the extent

that the outcome of any future experiment could be predicted.

In Ref. [7] it was shown

that eight well-chosen observables suﬃce to unambiguously determine the amplitudes. One

refers to a such a combination of observables as a “complete set”. However, this is only true

in a mathematical sense, and it has been established that there is no such thing as complete

sets when dealing with data with ﬁnite error bars [8–12].

Two categories can be distinguished for polarization observables: single-polarization (S =
{Σ (beam), T (target), P (recoil)}) where only one of the initial and ﬁnal state particles is
polarized, and double-polarization that require two polarized particles. The latter category
can be subdivided into three categories: beam-recoil (BR = {Cx, Cz, Ox, Oz}), beam-target
(BT = {E, F, G, H}) and target-recoil (T R = {Tx, Tz, Lx, Lz}) observables [13]. These are
connected to the reaction amplitudes through bilinear relations (see e.g. Ref. [8]). We note

that in practice, experiments are conﬁgured to have beam polarization, target polarization,

the ability to determine recoil polarization or some combination thereof. Each of these

experimental conﬁgurations are sensitive to diﬀerent combinations of “observables”, and so

3

the observables are not usually measured in isolation [14].

Models that are ﬁtted to the published observables, can in fact have very diﬀerent re-
action amplitudes. An example is the BT double polarisation observable E in (cid:126)γ(cid:126)p → π+n
that was measured recently [15]. Despite the availability of data for other observables,
the existing γp → π+n models predicted a large range of values of E at similar kinematic
points (see Fig. 3 in Ref. [15]), pointing to substantial diﬀerences among the models at the

amplitude level. The overall or “global” performance of two models can be compared by

averaging their least squared-distance to the measurements over all experimentally probed

kinematics. More restrictive is a “local” model discrimination, where models are compared

at speciﬁc kinematics (s, t). A partial-wave analysis parameterizes the cos θc.m. dependence

of the reaction amplitudes at ﬁxed s and can be regarded as an analysis technique that falls

in between “local” and“global”. In this work, we focus on the most local (and completely

model-independent) form of amplitude analysis, but we note that in practice it is probable

that model comparison will be done with partial wave analyses. The question that we aim to

address is what kind of experimental results do we need to be able to discriminate between

various models at speciﬁc kinematics.

In this work we use transversity amplitudes (TA), where particle spins are quantized in a

transverse basis. The TA have so-called “optimally simple” relations [16] to the observables,

in which the single-polarization observables depend on the amplitude moduli only [8, 9].

In what follows we use the representative Bonn-Gatchina [17] (BoGa) and hybrid Regge-
plus-Resonance [18] (RPR-2011) models for γp → K +Λ to set the scale of the introduced
measure. The BoGa model is a highly sophisticated coupled-channel model. The RPR-2011
model is a hybrid Regge-isobar model for γp → K +Λ with very low number of parameters.
Both models are ﬁtted to a large data set of cross sections, a sizable set of single-polarization

observables (mostly P ) and a limited number of double-polarization observables. The BoGa
and RPR-2011 models parametrize the γp → K +Λ background very diﬀerently at low
energies. Figure 1 shows A[A = BoGa, B = RPR-2011](W, cos θc.m.). Both models produce
comparable cross sections at forward θc.m.. The results for A(cos θc.m.) indicate that the

5

deviations between BoGa and RPR-2011 grow with increasing θc.m.. This reﬂects the fact

that the description of the background (which requires only a few parameters) in the RPR-

2011 model is physically less justiﬁed at backward angles [19].

At extremely backward θc.m. and in the threshold region, the measurements typi-
cally come with low statistics. Good experimental statistics are obtained for W ≥ 1.65
GeV and −0.75 ≤ cos θc.m. ≤ 0.85.

To further improve our knowledge of the physics underlying γN → M B processes, polar-

ization measurements are key [15]. Bilinear relations connect the polarization observables

to the amplitudes. Therefore, the potential impact of a polarization measurement is not

always clear a priori. At given kinematics, a measurement possesses the ability to locally

distinguish between two models (or two hypotheses) if its resolving power is smaller than the

diﬀerence between the two models in amplitude space. Therefore, we introduce a measure to

This analogy provides one with an expression for a distance in C4: the opening angle of the
position vectors, situated on the surface of the sphere, of two models in amplitude space

(measured along the sphere deﬁned by the normalization condition). For two amplitude sets

The quantity Re

depends on the reference phase. As bilinear relations connect

the observables to the amplitudes, the reference phase is inaccessible, and only the relative
phases can be determined. Hence, one can opt to ﬁx α4 = 0 of the M’s to infer the phase
information from the data, corresponding to the substitution αi → δ4
i (i = 1, 2, 3). We wish
to provide a distance measure that is independent of the choice of reference phase, so that

can it be used both for comparing models or for comparing a model with data. To this end,

in the deﬁnition of Eq. (6) we minimize the distance by varying the reference phase α4 of
MA while keeping all three relative phases δ4

i in both MA and MB ﬁxed.

Figure 2 shows the kinematic dependence of the D [RPR-2011, BoGa] for γp → K +Λ. The
distance between the two models grows as W and θc.m. increases. The models diﬀer in their

7

background parametrization and resonance content. The diﬀerences in the resonance content

are mainly visible at backward θc.m.. Also shown in Fig. 2 is the kinematic dependence of
D for two versions of the RPR-2011 model. Thereby, we study the kinematic dependence
of the distance in amplitude space between the full model and a model variant where the

coupling constant of the D13(1900) resonance is forced to be 0. This allows us to estimate

the eﬀect of removing a single resonance on the distance measure of Eq. (6). At forward θc.m.,

where the background contributions dominate, we ﬁnd that the diﬀerence is relatively small

compared to backward θc.m. where the resonance content dominates. The results indicate

that conﬁrmation or rejection of the presence of an s-channel resonance R from data in a
restricted kinematical range, requires experimental resolutions of the order D (cid:28) π/20 at
backward θc.m. and W (cid:38) MR.

In order to tell two models (A, B) apart in amplitude space, a combined experimental
resolution better than the characteristic D [MA,MB] is required. In Fig. 3 we show the
frequency distributions of D [MA,MB], which are derived from ensembles of values over
the range in W and cos θc.m., for four prototypical examples of model combinations (A, B).
The Kaon-MAID (KM) model [20] is a prototypical example of an isobar model for γp →
K +Λ. The KM model has not been reﬁtted to any data for the past 15 years, and hence,

no double-polarization data was included in the ﬁt. This means that only the moduli

of the amplitudes are constrained, while all phases are undetermined by the data. This
is reﬂected in the fact that the values of D [RPR-2011, KM] are signiﬁcant in amplitude
space. To estimate the required experimental resolution to identify the resonance content,
we also show the frequency distribution of D between the full RPR-2011 model and a
pure Regge model that only accounts for the Reggeized background contribution of RPR-
2011. The D [RPR-2011, Regge] distribution peaks at considerably larger values than the
D [RPR-2011, RPR-2011∗]. This is a reﬂection of the fact that hunting a particular resonance
in a small kinematic interval requires a substantially bigger experimental eﬀort (the results

point at a resolution which is at least a factor of ﬁve better) than identifying the global

eﬀect of all resonances.

III. MODEL-INDEPENDENT AMPLITUDES FROM DATA

This section deals with a fully model-independent extraction of the reaction amplitudes

from polarization data. Given a set of measurements, this is in principle achievable using

the bilinear relations that connect the observables to the reaction amplitudes. As the data

come with ﬁnite error bars it is essential to provide realistic estimates of the uncertainties

on the extracted amplitudes. We have explored two methods of statistical inference that

can quantify the propagated uncertainty on the extracted reaction amplitudes. Firstly,

a frequentist approach, using bootstrapping with χ2 minimization. Secondly, a Bayesian

approach whereby we explore the posterior distribution directly.

Given a set of N measured polarization observables {Aexp

i } ≡ {Aexp

i ± ∆Ai, i = 1, ..., N}
in a given (∆W, ∆ cos θc.m.) range, a bootstrap method boils down to creating M sets of
synthetic data {{A(j)
i }. Thereby,
each observable A(j)
, σ = ∆Ai). For each of the M sets,

(8)

The ensemble {M(j)} can be interpreted as the probability distribution in NTA space of
amplitudes that are compatible with the data {Aexp
i }. Each χ2-inference is a point estimate
of the M. Therefore, the most likely reaction amplitudes M are those related to the global
minimum of the χ2 surface. We search for this minimum with the aid of a genetic algorithm

(GA) followed by a gradient minimizer [22]. This strategy with a combination of a “rough”

and “high-precision” minimizer algorithm, has already been successfully applied to a precise

determination of resonance parameters in Ref. [23].

Another approach to extracting amplitudes from data is to sample amplitude space and

(9)

Here again we have assumed that all the polarization observables Aexp

i

are normally dis-

tributed. Upon evaluating the Eq. (9) with the Nested Sampling technique, one also obtains
the posterior distribution P (M|{Aexp
i }). We use the robust MultiNest version of the nested
sampling algorithm [24] in order to obtain posterior samples from distributions that may

contain multiple modes and pronounced degeneracies in high dimensions. Both the boot-

strapping and the Bayesian method described here provide one with a means to understand

how uncertainties in the measured experimental observables map onto the probability den-

sities in amplitude space. Obviously the quality of those uncertainties are far superior to for

example the Hessian error bars which are often quoted in papers.

As an illustration of the adopted methodology and to convince the reader of the impor-

tance of a detailed uncertainty propagation in parameter inference, we illustrate the result
of the bootstrap method for the extracted a3e−iα4 = r3eiδ4
Fig. 4. Thereby we use synthetic data for four combinations of polarization observables.

3 at representative kinematics in

The results indicate that after including realistic error bars for a mathematically complete

set as deﬁned by Chiang and Tabakin [7] one is left with a so-called continuous ambigu-

ity with hardly any information about the relative phase of one of the amplitudes. After

including information of three more double polarization observables one is left with a multi-

modal distribution for the phase. A unimodal posterior is typically reached after including
information from ≈ 12 diﬀerent polarization observables. Including additional observables

N behavior, where N is the number of
now improves the phase resolution via a typical 1/

observables in the data set.

We quantify the uncertainty of the posterior distribution P (M|{Aexp

i }) in amplitude
space in two ways. First, it is intuitive to regard the posterior as a distribution with a

central value and a standard deviation. In Eq. (6), we introduced a distance measure in

amplitude space that quantiﬁes the diﬀerence of two models at (W, cos θc.m.). Obviously, in

order to tell the diﬀerent models apart, one should aim at carrying out experiments with

a resolving power better than those representative values. In the absence of any data, the

∆M =

NTA are uniformly distributed over the surface of a unit 7-sphere. In what follows we refer
to this distribution as the prior π(M). We work out the evolution of the resolution in
amplitude space reached after combining data from several single- and double-polarization

experiments. Using Eq. (6), the dispersion of the ensemble of NTAs can be readily computed

(10)
where M0 is the central amplitude vector.
It can be shown that 0 ≤ D ≤ π/2. For a
given M0, one ﬁnds ∆M ≈ 1.08 for M distributed according to the prior π(M). Note
that expression (6) and the ∆M are invariant under any unitary transformation of the
amplitudes. Hence, Eq. (10) yields results which are identical for all amplitudes bases which

P (M|{Aexp

}) ,

i

are connected through unitary transformations. For example, the NTA and the normalized
helicity amplitudes (NHA) result in identical values for ∆M.

Figure 5 illustrates the current status of ∆M given the published polarization data
for γp → K +Λ. Hereby, we use the available CLAS {P, Cx(cid:48),z(cid:48)} data [25–28] and GRAAL
{Σ, T, P, Ox,z} data [29, 30]. For W > 1.9 GeV, one obtains larger ∆M values, which is
a reﬂection of the fact that the GRAAL data extends from threshold to W (cid:46) 1.9 GeV.
Inclusion of new CLAS data [31], which covers a wider energy range, lowers ∆M for W ≥
1.9 GeV to values that are comparable to those obtained for W < 1.9 GeV in Fig. 5.
Interestingly, inclusion of the new CLAS data does not signiﬁcantly diminish the ∆M
values for W < 1.9 GeV. This is primarily due to the fact that {Σ, T, P, Cx,z, Ox,z} is not a
mathematically complete set of observables.

The standard deviation in Eq. (10) is useful to connect the resolving power of experiments

to the distance between models (6). The second method to quantify the uncertainty of the
posterior distribution P (M|{Aexp
i }) does not require a central value M0. In Ref. [10] it was
pointed out that information entropy is a convenient way of quantifying the extent to which

one reaches a status of practical completeness given a set of measurements. The information
entropy H(P ) of the posterior P (M|{Aexp
P (M|{Aexp

i }) is deﬁned as
i }) log2 P (M|{Aexp

i }) dM .

H(P ) =

(cid:90)

(11)

We calculate the information gained through measurements relative to the prior distribution
π(M) (which reﬂects the situation of no measured polarization observables)

I(π, P ) = H(π) − H(P ) .

(12)

12

A large information gain indicates that a set of measurements accomplishes an exclusion of

signiﬁcant parts of the domain of possible solutions in amplitude space. Since we choose

to use base-2 logs, information is quantiﬁed in bits. One bit of information is equivalent

to decisive information on a boolean decision. For example, assume a set of measurements

which leaves a discrete ambiguity, corresponding to two identical, but non-overlapping peaks

in amplitude space. An additional measurement of which the only eﬀect is that it completely

excludes one of the two solutions, corresponds to an information gain of exactly one bit.

FIG. 5. The kinematic dependence of the computed ∆M given the published γp → K+Λ polar-

ization data. The grid is determined by (∆W = 20 MeV, ∆ cos θc.m. = 0.1).

The left panel in Figure 6 shows the result of a Bayesian inference of the reaction am-

plitudes for a number of observable sets. None of the observable sets constitute a complete

set. Hence, there is an upper value by which the information gain is limited. Using the

available data, one can at best determine the moduli ri=1,..,4 and two relative phases (δ4

2).
It was estimated in [10] that approximately 21 bits of information gain are required to form

1, δ3

a well-deﬁned unimodal distribution.

The comparison of the expected data resolution to the benchmark model distances are
also depicted in Fig. 6. For the available data set and W < 1.9 GeV, we obtain ∆M ∼ 0.5,
which indicates that one can locally resolve between RPR-2011 and the Kaon-MAID models.

Also, the uncertainty on the available data is low enough to locally distinguish RPR-2011

The “ALL” results for ∆M are obtained with synthetic data (with realistic error bars) for all 15

the results in Fig. 5 have been averaged over the considered cos θc.m. range.

and the pure Regge model. Hence, even in a limited kinematical region (“locally”), we

can at least say there is evidence of s-channel resonances in the current data. For W >
1.9 GeV, the distance D[RPR-2011, Regge] is less than the spread ∆M of the available
data, but similar to the resolution provided by the new CLAS data in addition to available

data. Therefore we expect that the new data should be able to tell us more about the

existence of resonances in the RPR model above W = 1.9 GeV, while the eﬀect below this

energy is relatively modest. Since background contributions dominate at forward angles,
D[RPR-2011, Regge] and D[BoGa, Regge] fall from backward to forward θc.m., therefore it
is apparent that measurements at backward angles contain more information about the

presence of s-channel resonances. The existence of speciﬁc resonances has a very small

eﬀect in amplitude space at a single (s, t) point. It is also observed that measurements of

all observables are required to resolve the relatively small distance between models diﬀering

by one resonance.

Summarizing, we have investigated methods to quantify the distance between models in

amplitude space. This distance measure can also be used to estimate in a model-independent

way how well a given set of combinations of polarization measurements will succeed in

constraining the underlying reaction amplitudes.
