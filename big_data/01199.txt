ABSTRACT
The maps of intensity and polarization of the radio synchrotron emission from shell-
type supernova remnants (SNRs) contain a considerable amount of information, al-
though of not easy interpretation. With the aim of deriving constraints on the 3-D
spatial distribution of the emissivity, as well as on the structure of both ordered and
random magnetic ﬁelds (MFs), we present here a scheme to model maps of the emission
and polarization in SNRs.

We ﬁrst generalize the classical treatment of the synchrotron emission to the case
in which the MF is composed by an ordered MF plus an isotropic random component,
with arbitrary relative strengths. In the case of a power-law particle energy distribu-
tion, we derive analytic formulae that formally resemble those for the classical case.
We also treat the case of a shock compression of a fully random upstream ﬁeld and
we predict that the polarization fraction in this case should be higher than typically
measured in SNRs. We implement the above treatment into a code, which simulates
the observed polarized emission of an emitting shell, taking into account also the eﬀect
of the internal Faraday rotation.

Finally, we show simulated maps for diﬀerent orientations with respect to the
observer, levels of the turbulent MF component, Faraday rotation levels, distributions
of the emissivity (either barrel-shaped or limited to polar caps), and geometries for the
ordered MF component (either tangential to the shell, or radial). Their analysis allows
us to outline properties useful for the interpretation of radio intensity and polarization
maps.

1 INTRODUCTION

Supernova remnants (SNRs), an aftermath of stellar explo-
sions, are among the ﬁrst sources that have been observed
by radio astronomers and, since the advent of radio interfer-
ometers, many of them have been mapped with high spatial
resolution: their typical shell-like emission pattern roughly
traces the location where the blast wave of the explosion hits
the ambient medium. In many cases radio detectors have
been devised to provide the observer with full information
about the incoming polarized radiation (i.e. all four Stokes
parameters).

In spite of this wealth of information, it seems that radio
observations of SNRs have not been fully exploited, at least
if compared with observations in other spectral bands, like
for instance in the X rays. One possible reason is that the ra-

dio emissivity, which in SNRs is typically non-thermal and
of synchrotron origin, depends on a combination of phys-
ical parameters that are separately poorly known, namely
the injection eﬃciency of the relativistic electrons and the
magnitude of the magnetic ﬁelds (hereafter MFs).

On the other hand, the spatial structure of the polariza-
tion may provide important clues on the geometrical struc-
ture of the MF. For instance, it was noted (Milne 1987)
that there is the tendency, in younger SNRs, for the polar-
ization to be consistent with a predominantly radial struc-
ture of the MF while, in older SNRs, with a MF structure
predominantly tangential to the SNR boundary: a review
on this issue may be found in Dubner & Giacani (2015).
This kind of dichotomy had been interpreted by some au-
thors (e.g. Jun & Norman 1996; Inoue et al. 2013) as an ev-
idence that in younger SNRs instabilities lead to strongly
tangled MFs. Instead in older SNRs the ordered component
of the MF still keeps memory of the pattern originated by

the shock compression of the ambient MF. It has also been
shown (Petruk et al. 2016) that in post-adiabatic SNRs the
parallel component of the MF decreases, while the perpen-
dicular one increases in the shock downstream. Therefore,
shocks of diﬀerent obliquities in old SNRs tend to eventu-
ally become quasi-perpendicular, even those that initially
were quasi-parallel.

in the

MF turbulent ampliﬁcation generated by kinetic pro-
cesses
case of a “quasi-parallel” shock (e.g.
Caprioli & Spitkovsky 2014b, and reference therein) should
give rise to a tangential ordered component: in fact, eﬃcient
MF ampliﬁcation taking place upstream of the shock leads,
in the most extreme case, to a completely random MF; but
then the shock compresses this ﬁeld, enhancing the tangen-
tial component with respect to the radial one. Therefore the
observation of a radially oriented MFs cannot be justiﬁed
even in this case, but suggests instead the onset of hydrody-
namic instabilities, like Rayleigh-Taylor (e.g. Jun & Norman
1996) or Richtmyer-Meshkov (e.g. Inoue et al. 2013) insta-
bilities.

Observations show that the polarization fractions vary
from object to object, and from region to region within
the same object, but their typical values are much lower
than the maximum theoretically allowed limit (≃ 69%, for
a slope –0.5 of the synchrotron emission, namely a slope
–2.0 in the energy distribution of the emitting electrons).
For instance, Dickel & Milne (1976) quote generally low po-
larizations, usually < 10%; while Kothes et al. (2006) show
that the peaks of polarization fraction typically range from
about 10% to about 50%. This seems to indicate that the
discrepancy between theory and observations can be partly
explained with the superposition, along the line of sight, of
regions where the MFs have diﬀerent orientations, and/or
with the presence of a partially random MF.

This work presents a detailed treatment of synchrotron
emission in the case of a partially random MF, and imple-
ments it within a thin-shell SNR model. This approximation
allows us to considerably simplify the problem (also making
our numerical models much lighter to compute), while re-
taining a a large number of eﬀects, and therefore allowing
an analysis a wide variety of realistic cases. Since our aim
is to to show in which way quantitative information could
be eﬀectively extracted from (suitably detailed) polarization
maps, but not to model speciﬁc sources, we will discuss here
only simple geometries.

The plan of the paper is as follows.
Sect. 2 analyzes the synchrotron emissivity and its po-
larization properties. We begin reviewing the classical ap-
proach, valid for the case of particles with a power-law en-
ergy distribution (as it is typically the case for radio emit-
ting particles) sitting in a uniform MF. We then introduce
a generalization of this approach, which extends its validity
to the case of a partially disordered MF, with the random
component assumed to be isotropic. This treatment allows
a continuity from the case of an almost uniform MF to that
of an almost completely randomized one. In a similar way,
we also estimate the level of polarization induced by the
compression, at a shock front, of an originally fully random
MF. Just a feeling is given of the diﬃculties that arise if the
particle distribution is not a power-law, by considering the
mono-energetic case.

For a correct modelling of radio polarization maps, to

be compared with actual observations, it is required to prop-
erly sum up the local emissivity in the various Stokes pa-
rameters, by also correcting for the Faraday Rotation (FR)
eﬀects. While this could apply to many diﬀerent classes of
astrophysical sources, in Sect. 3 we focus on the case of radio
shell-type SNRs, with suitable assumptions on the geometry
of the MF as well as on the spatial distribution of thermal gas
and of the emitting particles. In particular, we assume axial
symmetry, and the “thin-layer” simpliﬁed approach, deriving
formulae that we then extensively use in our modelling. At
the end of this section we also present a momenta approach,
which allows us to formally treat also a more general case of
source structure, in the limit of suﬃciently short radiation
wavelengths.

In Sect. 4 we present a variety of simulated maps ob-
tained under diﬀerent parameters choices, and we use them
to discuss for instance the eﬀects of changing the aspect an-
gle, the level of internal FR, the level of MF ﬂuctuations.

In addition to the “classical” case, in which the ordered
MF component has a meridional structure, consistent with a
compression of a pre-existing uniform ambient MF, in Sect. 5
we also investigate the completely diﬀerent case, probably
more appropriate for some young SNRs, in which the ob-
served MF structure is mostly radial. We compare some of
your results with the observed structure of the SNR SN 1006.

Sect. 5 concludes.

2 LOCAL EMISSIVITY AND POLARIZATION

In this section we study the synchrotron emissivity, from an
element of volume. The meaning of adding the word “radio”
is that we consider only the case in which the energy dis-
tribution of the relevant electrons is a pure power law, as it
is typically for radio emission. For X-ray emitting electrons,
instead, their energy distribution experiences a cutoﬀ, which
would require a diﬀerent treatment from that presented be-
low.

2.1 The classical case of a uniform MF

Let us begin with a review of the basic formulae about syn-
chrotron radiation, and polarized radiation in general (see
e.g. Rybicki & Lightman 1979). Let us ﬁrst consider the
case of a particle with a given Lorentz factor γ, moving in a
MF B (assumed to be uniform, at least on scales smaller
than the particle gyration radius). In this case the syn-
chrotron power emitted per unit frequency (ω = 2πν; so
that P (ν) = 2πP (ω)) is the sum of polarized components,
respectively perpendicular and parallel to the direction of
the projected MF, which are equal to

P⊥(ω) =

Pk(ω) =

So far, the distinction between primed and unprimed Stokes
parameters has been just formal. However, starting from the
next section, it will become more substantial. With a MF
varying in time the primed reference frame, which is instan-
taneously oriented with the MF, also changes its orientation
with time, and therefore the primed Stokes parameters can
only appear, as instantaneous values, inside the integrals
that we will use to estimate quantities averaged over ﬂuctu-
ations.

2.2 Inclusion of an isotropic random MF

Scope of this section is to extend the classical treatment
of the synchrotron emission to the case in which the MF
is a combination of an ordered and of a random compo-
nent. While the two limit cases of a uniform MF (maximally
anisotropic emissivity, and maximal polarization fraction),
and of a completely random MF (isotropic and unpolarized
emission) are well known, the intermediate cases are not so
obvious. In particular, it must be clear that in the case of
a partly random MF it would be incorrect to estimate the
time-averaged synchrotron emissivity as simply the sum of
the emissivities of its ordered component and of random
part. We will show, instead, that a general theory can be
developed, as a rather natural extension of the treatment
for the case of a uniform MF.

Let us consider now a MF B = ¯B + δB, where ¯B is
its average (which, without loss of generality, we assume to
be directed along ˆy) while δB varies randomly according to
an isotropic Gaussian distribution. Indeed, one may envis-
age an ample choice of statistical distributions for the ran-
dom component: for instance, one could have assumed δB
to be perpendicular to ¯B . Our choice is motivated instead
not only by an advantage for the computations but also by
the fact that, with our recipe, we can treat in a continu-
ous and homogeneous way both cases in which ﬂuctuations
are just a small perturbation and those in which they dom-
inate, and that in all cases the observed emission depends
uniquely on the properties of the projected MF. Instead, for
instance, the prescription of purely transverse ﬂuctuations
would have lead to the paradox that, in the limit of very
large ﬂuctuations, an energetically irrelevant ¯B would still
play a leading role, determining the orientation of ﬂuctua-
tions. Another important constraint on the ﬂuctuations is
that they must be consistent with a vanishing divergence
of the total MF. However, this constraint applies only to

(where the constant K is deﬁned by the last equation; here-
after the symbol ˆ= will be used to indicate the deﬁnition of a
new quantity, rather than a result), and B⊥ the modulus of
the projected MF: note that all formulae depend only on the
projected MF, while the component radial to the observer
does not aﬀect the emission (it could be investigated only
through propagation eﬀects, namely through FR).

It is more convenient to express this emission in terms of
the Stokes parameters. To be more precise, by now we con-
sider only their “local values”, namely their values per unit
path; while the actual Stokes parameters (namely those that
should match the observations) will be obtained by integra-
tion along the line of sight. The choice of reference orienta-
tion for the linear polarization parameters, Q and U , is such
that:

Q = hExE∗
U = (cid:10)ExE∗

xi −(cid:10)EyE∗
y(cid:11) ;
y(cid:11) + hEyE∗
xi ,

(6)

(7)

where Ex and Ey are the components of the complex ampli-
tude of the electric vector.

Without loss of generality, let us ﬁrst consider an ori-
entation of axes with the unit vector ˆx′ perpendicular to
B⊥ and ˆy′ parallel to it. In this way, the parameters I ′ (to-
tal ﬂux) and Q′ (diﬀerence between the linear polarizations
along the two axes) relative to the emission of a single par-
ticle are

where the quantity H is deﬁned by the rightmost equalities.
Note that the Stokes parameters respectively associated to
tilted linear polarization (U ′) and circular polarization (V ′)
are both vanishing.
For any other reference frame x-y, rotated of an angle χ
(taken to be anti-clockwise) with respect to the x′-y′ refer-
ence frame chosen above, the Stokes parameters transform
as

I = I ′;
cos(2χ)Q′ + sin(2χ)U ′ = cos(2χ)Q′;
Q =

tions. In fact, without loss of generality, we will consider
only the transverse MF components. By changing the el-

2.3 An anisotropic random MF

A scenario somehow diﬀerent from that outlined above ap-
plies to the case of eﬃcient particle acceleration in a quasi-
parallel shock (see e.g. Caprioli & Spitkovsky 2014a, and ref-
erences therein): in this case a strong MF turbulent ampliﬁ-
cation takes place upstream of the shock front. This turbu-
lent MF is roughly isotropic, as long as it keeps upstream;
but the compression at the shock has the eﬀect of enhanc-
ing the ﬁeld components parallel to the shock front, leading
to an anisotropic random MF component downstream. Un-
der general conditions, this case is more complex than that
outlined in the previous section, and does not allow an ana-
lytic solution. However, it becomes considerably simpler in
the case of a negligible original MF ( ¯B = 0): a condition
physically rather reasonable, whenever the MF experiences
a strong ampliﬁcation.

Let us consider also in this case just the projected MF,
and assume the following distributions for the two compo-

Figure 6. Comparison of the spectral proﬁle of the synchrotron
emissivity from a mono-energetic particles distribution, both in
the case of a completely ordered MF (dashed line), and in that
of a fully random MF (solid line). Beﬀ indicates the eﬀective MF
for each case, namely ¯B in the former case, and √2σ in the latter
one.

therefore leading, as expected, to the same limit value of the
polarization fraction as in the case of a fully ordered MF.

The above results can be readily applied to estimate
the polarization induced by a shock compression. If the pro-
jected shock velocity is along the x axis, in the downstream
σx would be equal to σ in the upstream, while σy would be
enhanced by a factor κ (where κ is the shock compression
ratio). In the case of a strong shock with κ = 4, then, fan
would be equal to 15/17; the related polarization fraction,
evaluated from Eq. 42 is shown in Fig. 5. It is worth noting
that in this case the downstream emission still exhibits a
strong polarization, much stronger than typically measured
in typical shell-like SNRs.

2.4 Mono-energetic electron distribution

We have shown how, in the case of a power-law energy dis-
tribution of the electrons, one may obtain in a rather elegant
way analytic formulae for the polarized emission that resem-
ble the classical formulae for a the case of a fully ordered
MF.

Unfortunately, for a general particle energy distribution
the situation is much more complex, and there is no guar-
antee about the existence of analytic solutions. Just to give
an feeling of the kind of additional problems arising in the
general case, let us consider here the case of total intensity
(hIiγ ) for a mono-energetic distribution of particles: this
case requires one to solve Eq. 20, for a ﬁxed γ value. In spite
of the expected simplicity of this problem, we have not found
any analytic solution to it except for the two limiting cases,
namely a fully ordered and a completely random MF.

The former case is simply proportional to the emitted
spectrum from a single particle, Eq. 8. The latter case, in-
stead, is obtained by evaluating Eq. 20 in the limit ¯B = 0.
Using Eq. 3 for the deﬁnition of F (x), and inverting the

(49)

in order to obtain a formula that formally resembles Eq. 8.
Fig. 6 shows a comparison between F (x) and Fσ(√2x)/√2
(where the √2 factors come from the fact that, in the com-
pletely random case, the eﬀective MF strength would be
equal to √2σ). The present analysis is in a sense similar
to that in Pohl et al. (2015); the main diﬀerences are that
that paper assumes a 1-D Gaussian distribution for the MF
values and an approximation of F (x), while here we use a
2-D one, which we think is more correct, and the exact F (x)
function: the interesting fact is that our approach luckily
allows an exact solution.

However, no analytic solution is known for cases inter-
mediate between a fully ordered and a fully random ﬁeld.
This issue, which is also preliminary to any further gen-
eralization to particle energy distributions diﬀerent from
the pure power-law one (the case thoroughly treated in the
present work), will need a separate treatment.

3 MODELLING SHELL-TYPE SNRS

In order to apply the formulae derived in the previous section
and to synthesize the emission and polarization maps for
shell-like SNRs, we need to introduce SNR models on which
to integrate the contribution of all volume elements along
the lines of sight. In the most general case the number of
parameters would be unfortunately so large to hinder any
extensive investigation in the parameters space.

For this reason in the following of this paper we will
limit our discussion to the case of a thin layer model of a
spherical shell-type SNR. According to this approximation,
in each position of the map the observed emission originates
from two (geometrically thin) limbs, at a physical distance
Rs from the SNR center. Moreover, we assume that we can
substitute the actual proﬁles of all physical quantities (like
the density of the thermal gas, that of the relativistic par-
ticles, as well as the MF direction and strength) with their
average values. As we shall see, also this very simpliﬁed ap-
proximation my lead to a rather complex and various phe-
nomenology. In a forthcoming paper we shall release this
assumption, and discuss the validity and limits of the thin
layer approximation.

In the rest of this section we will describe in more detail

the various elements of this model.

3.1 Physical and projected coordinates

A very important although just geometrical task is how to
convert speciﬁc elements in the SNR from/to points on the

8

R. Bandiera, O. Petruk

observed map, and in this section we present some relations
that allow us to make this conversion easier.

Let {r, θ, ϕ} be the spherical coordinates in a reference
system oriented with respect to a given axis that we will
identify with the SNR axis. In order to further simplify the
modelling, we also assume that the SNR is axially symmet-
ric, namely no explicit dependence on ϕ of the SNR physical
quantities. Moreover, as before, let {x, y} be the coordinates
of the map and z that along the line of sight.
Let us also deﬁne ̺ and Θ as the projected radial and
angular coordinates, and φo as the angle (aspect angle) by
which the SNR axis is tilted with respect to the line of sight.
The projection of the SNR axis can be assumed, without loss
of generality, to lie along the x direction. A preliminary step
is to set the conversion between the two sets of coordinates.
Under the above assumptions, the map coordinates read

x = ̺ cos Θ = r (cos φo sin θ cos ϕ + sin φo cos θ) ; (50)

y = ̺ sin Θ = r sin θ sin ϕ,

while the line of sight coordinate

z = r (cos φo cos θ − sin φo sin θ cos ϕ) .
Using Eqs. 50 and 51 one can derive

cos ϕ =

sin ϕ =

˜̺ cos Θ − sin φo cos θ

cos φo sin θ

;

˜̺ sin Θ
sin θ

,

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

where ˜̺ = ̺/r, which is always less than unity. It is worth
noting that, if we consider a spherical shell, the tilt angle
(τ ) of an element of surface would be such that sin τ = ˜̺.

Eqs. 53 and 54 can be combined to give

cos θ = ˜̺ sin φo cos Θ ± cos φop1 − ˜̺2,

the two solutions referring respectively to the nearer and
further limb of the sphere of radius r, intercepted by the
line of sight.

(55)

3.2 MF geometry

Probably the most natural geometry for the ordered MF
component is that based in the idea that the SNR expands
in an ambient medium with a pre-existing uniform ambient
MF Bamb, and that the MF structure inside the SNR itself
is a direct consequence of compression. We also assume that
the morphology to the SNR emission is aﬀected by this MF
geometry, and in particular that the SNR symmetry axis is
aligned with the ambient MF direction.

Within the thin-layer approach, all MF lines are asymp-
totically aligned along the meridians. Therefore, in the SNR
reference frame, the magnetic unit vector is
ˆB = {− cos θ cos ϕ,− cos θ sin ϕ, sin θ} ,
or with opposite sign, depending on the MF orientation
(anyway, this orientation does not aﬀect in any way the val-
ues of the Stokes parameters). The projection of this unit
vector on the x-y plane is then

(56)

(cid:26) sin φo − ˜̺ cos Θ cos θ

sin θ

,−

˜̺ sin Θ cos θ

sin θ

(cid:27) ;

(57)

while the magnetic pitch angle α is

cos α =

sin θ2 − sin φ2

o + ˜̺ cos Θ cos θ sin φo
cos φo sin θ

.

(58)

As for the strength of the ordered MF, the ﬂux conservation
leads to

¯B =

sin θ Bamb

1 − (1 − w(θ)/Rs)2 ≃

sin θ Bamb
2w(θ)/Rs

,

(59)

where w(θ) is the layer thickness, the thin-layer approxi-
mation requiring w(θ) ≪ Rs at all θ. This results in an
artiﬁcially large B, but it does not aﬀect the patterns of
polarization maps.

Also the densities of thermal and relativistic particle
components will depend on the layer thickness. The mass
conservation implies:

ρ =

ρamb

1 − (1 − w(θ)/Rs)3 ≃

ρamb

3 w(θ)/Rs

.

(60)

Let us also assume that the relativistic component is frozen
in the MF and evolves adiabatically (the Lorentz factors
then evolving as γ ∝ ρ1/3). In this case the normalization
factor A, as deﬁned in Eq. 12, is

A = As(cid:18) ρ

ρs(cid:19)1+(s−1)/3

= As(θ)(cid:18) 3w(θ)

4Rs (cid:19)(s+2)/3

.

(61)

The quantity As(θ), namely its value right downstream of
the shock, is generally unknown. Let us assume here that,
for the sake of simplicity, both w(θ) and As(θ) are constant.
These values are not important here, because in the rest
of the paper we will concentrate on the form factors, and
we will present only normalized emission maps. Let us add
that, as shown by Eqs. 13–15, the synchrotron emissivity at
a given frequency ω is proportional to AB(s+1)/2
. Therefore
there is a degeneracy between the layer thickness, the nor-
malization of the energy distribution of particles, and the
MF strength (to the power (s + 1)/2), in the sense that if we
scale any of them by a given factor the resulting emissivity
will be scaled by the same factor, and leaving completely
unchanged the pattern of the various maps.

⊥

Another MF geometry, suggested by radio polariza-
tion maps of younger SNRs (Milne 1987), is the radial one,
namely
ˆB = {sin θ cos ϕ, sin θ sin ϕ, cos θ} .
Of course, this does not imply the (quite unphysical) as-
sumption of a magnetic monopole. Since the polarization
properties of the synchrotron emission do not depend on
the MF orientation, one could imagine a mixture of inward
and outward oriented radial MF lines. Diﬀerently from the
previous case, now there is no obvious recipe about the de-
pendence of the ordered MF strength on the position, so we
will have to choose it a priori (see the two cases discussed in
Sect. 5).

(62)

3.3 Faraday Rotation

The Stokes parameters projected onto the plane of the sky
can be obtained by integration of the local values along the
line of sight. However, for the two Stokes parameters related
to linear polarization, one should also take into account the

MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2016)

FR, a propagation eﬀect that produces a rotation (by an
angle β) of the polarization plane, according to the formula

show how they are obtained, by integrating along the line of
sight, and also accounting for the FR eﬀect:

(63)

with n being the local plasma electron density, λ = 2πc/ω
the radiation wavelength, and z2, z1 two given positions
along the line of sight (of which z2 is the closer to the ob-
server). By deﬁning the rotation measure as

RM (z1, z2) =

n(z′)Bz(z′) dz′,

(64)

e3
2πm2

ec4 Z z2

z1

one can simply write β = RM λ2. In order to simplify the no-
tation in some points, we will also use RM (z) = RM (z, zobs)
(where zobs is at the observer’s location). This formula for
the FR is linear in B, which means that only the ordered
MF matters, while the eﬀect of ﬂuctuations averages to zero.
It is however necessary to distinguish between “fore-
ground FR” (namely that produced by the medium between
the SNR and the observer) and “internal FR” (namely that
produced inside the SNR itself). The eﬀect of a foreground
medium on the observed Stokes parameters (of course, only
Q and U are aﬀected) is the following

Q = cos(2β)Qi − sin(2β)Ui;
U = sin(2β)Qi + cos(2β)Ui,

(65)

(66)

where Qi and Ui indicate the intrinsic Stokes parameters,
namely in the absence of FR, as it is the case for λ → 0;
while β is the angle of rotation accumulated between the
source boundary closest to the observer, and zobs. It is worth
noting that the above formulae are not only valid to describe
the eﬀect of the interstellar medium in front of the SNR, but
also to that of the SNR front-side limb with respect to the
emission from the rear-side limb.

Instead, the eﬀect of the “internal FR” on the observed
polarization is more complex, since diﬀerent rotation mea-
sures apply to the radiation emitted in diﬀerent layers, so
that a double integral is required to evaluate its overall ef-
fect.

As it will better shown below, a more general relation
between the intrinsic and observed Stokes parameters can
be described by the relations

Q = fobs(cid:16) cos(2RMobsλ2)Qi − sin(2RMobsλ2)Ui(cid:17); (67)
U = fobs(cid:16) sin(2RMobsλ2)Qi + cos(2RMobsλ2)Ui(cid:17), (68)

which allow us deﬁne what we intend by “observed” Fara-
day depolarization factor (fobs) and RM (RMobs). Only in
the case of a purely foreground FR we have fobs = 1 and
RMobs equal to the quantity described by Eq. 64; while in
the general case both fobs and RMobs will depend on λ.

Finally, it is worth noting that, while the FR due to
a foreground medium could be completely corrected in the
post-processing phase (provided that the radio data have
a suﬃciently narrow bandwidth), no such correction could
be applied in the case of internal FR, since the intrinsic
depolarization is irreversible.

3.4 Observed polarization

Before proceeding with the derivation of the observed Stokes
parameters, let us draw there the general equations that

MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2016)

Q = R z2

z1 I(z′)dz′;
z1 (cid:16) cos (2β(z1, z′)) Q(z′)

(69)

U = R z2

z1 (cid:16) sin (2β(z1, z′))Q(z′)

+ cos (2β(z1, z′)) U(z′)(cid:17)dz′.

The polarization fraction can be then derived as

The angle

(70)

(71)

is orthogonal to the polarization angle, and gives the average
orientation of the “observed” MF, namely we have

Bx = B cos Ψ,

By = B sin Ψ.

(72)

3.5 Single-layer case

The problem simpliﬁes considerably within the thin-layer
approximation, namely under the assumption that nBz, as
well as the speciﬁc Q and U values, are constant across the
shell. In this case, since

dβ
dz′ =

e3λ2
2πm2

ec4 nBz

(73)

is constant, the integration along a layer (z1 = 0, z2 = z)
leads to the following relations:

In addition, we readily have:

Namely, the amount of rotation is half of that for a fore-
ground layer; while, diﬀerently from the case of a foreground
FR, which turns out into a mere rotation of the polarization
plane, now the observed polarization fraction is lower than
the intrinsic one. In fact

3.6 Two-layers combination

The observed Stokes parameters read

In the case of a thin shell SNR, in each projected position we
see the combination of the eﬀects of two layers, each of them
subject to internal FR, and in addition the front-side layer
Faraday rotating the polarized emission from the rear-side
one (in the following we will label the front and rear limb
quantities as “f” and “r” respectively). We then have

Q=Z cos(cid:16)2RM (z)λ2(cid:17)Q(z) − sin(cid:16)2RM (z)λ2(cid:17)U(z) dz;(84)
U =Z sin(cid:16)2RM (z)λ2(cid:17)Q(z) + cos(cid:16)2RM (z)λ2(cid:17)U(z) dz.(85)

Let us introduce the quantities

Q =

sin(RMf λ2)

RMf λ2 (cid:16) cos(RMf λ2)Qf − sin(RMf λ2)Uf(cid:17)
RMrλ2 (cid:16) cos(RMxλ2)Qr − sin(RMxλ2)Ur(cid:17);
RMf λ2 (cid:16) sin(RMf λ2)Qf + cos(RMf λ2)Uf(cid:17)

where RMx = 2RMf + RMr.

Even in the simpliﬁed case of two homogeneous thin lay-
ers, the formulae for fobs and RMobs (as deﬁned by Eqs. 67
and 67) turn out to be rather complex. For this reason we
consider here the limit for small rotations, namely for small
enough λ values, getting

fobs = 1 −

(83)
where QUm = Qf Ur − QrUf , QUp = QiQr + UiUr, RMt =
RMf + RMr, Qi = Qf + Qr and Ui = Uf + Ur. Note that
the quantity fobs, previously dubbed as “depolarization fac-
tor” does not always lead to a decreased polarization level.
In its series expansion, it depends on the sign of the coeﬃ-
cient of λ2). This means that under some circumstances the
diﬀerential FR may have a constructive eﬀect.

At least in principle, comparing polarizations measured
at various wavelengths, including longer ones, would allow
one to measure more coeﬃcients of the power expansions
with λ of both RMobs and fobs, then allowing to get further
information on the MF structure. This is unfortunately a
diﬃcult observational task at the present time, but it should
become feasible with the advent of larger radiotelescopes
operating at low-frequency radio wavelengths (like in the
cases of LOFAR and SKA).

3.7 A generalized momentum treatment

Releasing the thin-layer assumption, the treatment of the
internal FR becomes considerably more complex, since the
calculation of the observed Stokes parameters requires the
explicit calculation of a double integral for each projected
point. A complete solution of the inverse problem, namely
how to derive from the observations the 3-D structure of
density and MF, looks then essentially hopeless. However,
in an analogous way to that shown in the previous section,
some relation can be derived as power-law expansions, in the
limit of wavelengths.

Qi,n = Z ∞
Ui,n = Z ∞

0 Q(z)RM (z)n dz;
0 U(z)RM (z)n dz

(86)

(87)

(in the following, for Qi,0 and Ui,0 we shall simply use Qi and
Ui respectively). It can be shown that the power expansions
of both observed depolarization fobs and rotation measure
RMobs can be expressed as fractions whose numerator is
a polynomial of these I quantities, while the denominator
is a power of (Q2
i ). We present here the expansions
equivalent to those shown by Eqs. 82 and 83 for the thin-
layer case

Here is a list of general conclusions arising from this analy-
sis (and that in some respects, conﬁrm what already found
from the thin-layer approximated analysis):
- Diﬀerently from what happens when the FR is just due to
foreground medium, the internal FR does not simply scale
with λ2.
- While foreground FR does not cause depolarization (apart
from that produced by the ﬁnite spectral width of the tele-
scope), internal FR necessarily involves some change in the
polarization level, which depending on the case may lead to
a depolarization or to an increase of the polarization frac-
tion.
- The momentum analysis can in principle provide an in-
ﬁnite number of observational constraints: they correspond
to the various orders of the power expansion in λ of Eqs. 88
and 89 that, combined to the fact that Q → Qi and U → Ui,
for λ → 0.
- Unfortunately, the number of relations is not suﬃcient to
derive Q(z), U(z), and RM (z) independently (but just two
of them, given the third one): therefore some a priori condi-
tions on the MF and the emissivity must be given.

4 THIN-LAYER MODELS OF SNRS

4.2 The eﬀect of FR

Radio polarization maps of SNRs

13

In this section we present and discuss some SNR models
generated using the thin-layer approach described above. It
is not our intention, at this stage, to model any individ-
ual SNR, also because real maps typically show patterns
at smaller scales, which will not be considered here. Our
present aim is just that of outlining some general trends, for
a better insight on the importance of the various parameters.
For all models presented below we have used a shell thick-
ness 10−2 times its radius , and a power-law particle energy
distribution with s = 2 (corresponding to a radio spectral
index of 0.5, close to what usually measured in SNRs). The
exact value of the thickness (w, here taken to be constant),
provided it is much smaller than Rs, does not aﬀect consid-
erably the pattern of the emission maps, but just their ﬂux
normalization.

It must be noticed that all maps of surface brightness

presented below are normalized to

WoB(s+1)/2

o

w,

(94)

where the quantities Wo and Bo are their respective max-
imum values within the shell: for instance, the equatorial
value (namely that at θ = π/2), for a meridional MF like
that deﬁned above. In the following maps (except when
stated diﬀerently) the projection of the SNR symmetry axis
runs from left to right; while for all maps in tones of grey,
lighter tones means higher values.

4.1 Fully ordered MF and negligible FR

Let us begin considering the case of a completely ordered
MF, aligned along the meridians, as from Eqs. 56–59 with
constant layer thickness. Let us also assume that the normal-
ization A of the particle distribution is a constant (diﬀerent
functional dependencies with θ will also be used, then chang-
ing the relative importance of the emissivity, for instance, of
the equatorial zone with respect to the polar ones).

At this stage we take an observing frequency high
enough that FR does not give any appreciable eﬀect. The re-
sults are shown in Fig. 7, 8, 9, and 10, respectively for aspect
angles of 0◦ (the polar direction), 30◦, 60◦, and 90◦ (along
the equatorial plane): this choice of aspect angles allows one
to appreciate the continuity of the change of properties be-
tween the limit cases, even though they look so diﬀerent one
from the other.

The three upper panels, from left to right, show the
maps in the I, Q and U Stokes parameters; while the three
lower panels show more intuitive polarization quantities
namely, again from left to right, the polarization fraction,
the magnetic polarization angle with respect to the pro-
jected axis, and ﬁnally the vectorial map of the magnetic
polarization.

In the 0◦ and 90◦ special cases the direction of projected
MF in the front layer coincides with that in the rear layer:
therefore, in the absence of FR, the measured polarization
is spatially constant, and reaches its maximum theoretical
value (for all these maps we have assumed s = 2, equivalent
to a spectral index of –0.5 for the emission).

MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2016)

In the same way as we did with the emission, let us use
dimensionless quantities also for the treatment of FR. With
reference to Eq. 63, let us normalize all RM quantities with:

e3
ec4 noBow
2πm2

(95)

where no is the electron density in the shell. In Fig. 11, 12,
13, and 14 we may see the kind of distortion produced by
FR: here we have used an intermediate value of RM, namely
such to give a FR equal to unity at the equator, when seen
face-on. The results are shown in Fig. 11, 12, 13, and 14,
respectively for the same aspect angles of 0◦, 30◦, 60◦, and
90◦: also in this case, even though the patterns are distorted,
one may appreciate the continuity in the change of pattern
between contiguous aspect angles.

4.3 The eﬀect of a random MF component

Let us consider here just the case in which in addition to
the ordered MF there is an isotropic random component, in
which case the emission quantities derive from Eqs. 26 and
27. While there is an inﬁnity of possible cases, here we shall
just consider the simplest one (even though not physically
more justiﬁed than others), in which the σ/ ¯B ratio is con-
stant everywhere; moreover, with the aim of discussing the
various eﬀects independently, let us consider here just the
case with vanishing FR. For an isotropic random MF com-
ponent, a constant σ/ ¯B ratio means that on the projected
MF the eﬀect of ﬂuctuations will be larger when the ordered
MF is oriented closer to the line of sight, and therefore the
depolarization level will be higer in those cases. The eﬀect
is more evident at large aspect angles, so that in Fig. 15 we
present the case at an aspect angle of 90◦ (and σ/ ¯B = 1):
this map has to be compared with Fig. 10.

4.4 Structure of RM maps

In the previous sections we have already made a distinction
between the standard deﬁnition of the RM (Eq. 64, which
can be associated to real observations only in the case of FR
of a background source), and the RM (plus depolarization)
that can be actually derived from observations in the case
of intrinsic FR (see Eqs. 82 and 83). Figs. 16 and 18, respec-
tively associated to Figs. 12 and 14, show these FR-related
quantities: in the upper panels the RM as from the stan-
dard deﬁnition, namely (from left to right) its total value,
the value for the front layer, and that for the rear layer;
in the lower panels, instead, (again from left to right) the
observed map of the intrinsic RM (more precisely RMobs,0,
its small λ limit), and then the quantities tracing the next
order of approximation eﬀects respectively on the polariza-
tion direction (RMobs,2; the coeﬃcient of λ2, in Eq. 83) and
on the polarization degree (fobs,2; the coeﬃcient of λ2, with
positive sign, in Eq. 82).

The next order of approximation eﬀects, which to our
knowledge have not been measured as yet, should be observ-
able with high-quality and high-resolution observations at
low-frequency radio wavelength: testing their patterns would
provide a further information to constrain the structure of a
radio SNR. We may see that, at an aspect angle of 90◦, the

second-order terms vanish: in general, one may expect them
to vanish all the times in which the intrinsic polarization
angles of the front and rear layer are equal, this implying
the quantity QUm (deﬁned right after Eq. 83) to vanish.

5 POLAR-CAPS VS BARREL-LIKE MODELS

So far we have considered the simplest possible case, namely
that in which the shocked ambient medium is conﬁned to a
shell of constant thickness, the MF into that shell is just the
result of the ambient ﬁeld compression, and the normaliza-
tion of the particles energy spectrum is the same everywhere.
Let us release now the last assumption and, following
Fulbright & Reynolds (1990), let us parametrize the acceler-
ation eﬃciency with the “obliquity angle”, namely the angle
between the shock normal and the (ordered component of
the) MF. Consistently with what typically assumed in the
literature, we will consider here the angle between the shock
velocity and the post-shock MF (θBn2), which is linked to
the polar angle by the relations

sin θBn2 =

cos θBn2 =

κ sin θ

cos θ

pκ2 sin2 θ + cos2 θ
pκ2 sin2 θ + cos2 θ

;

.

(96)

(97)

Incidentally, the polar angle θ coincides with the angle be-
tween the shock velocity and the ambient MF, θBn1.

Let us also deﬁne, as “quasi-parallel” and “quasi-
perpendicular” cases, those in which the normalization of
the particle energy distribution is respectively proportional
to cos2 θBn2 (therefore enhancing the emissivity at obliq-
uity angles closer to 0◦) or to sin2 θBn2 (which privilege an-
gles closer to 90◦). In the former case the emission will be
then enhanced near the polar regions (“polar-cap” morphol-
ogy), while in the latter one around the equatorial regions
(“barrel-like” morphology). Critical comparisons of these two
morphologies are present in the literature, when discussing
the nature of bilateral SNRs in general (e.g. Orlando et al.
2007; Fulbright & Reynolds 1990), or more speciﬁcally the
case of SN 1006 ((e.g. Schneiter et al. 2015; Bocchino et al.
2011; Schneiter et al. 2010).

In fact, the quasi-perpendicular prescription leads to
maps very similar to those of the isotropic case: in fact Eq. 96
gives values very close to unity, except in narrow regions
around the poles. The opposite is for Eq. 97, which leads to
polar-cap enhanced emission, and for which one can easily
appreciate the diﬀerences (see for instance Fig. 19, for an
aspect angle of 90◦, to be compared with Fig. 10).

We have already mentioned that, for young SNRs, there
is an indication that the MF conﬁguration must be mostly
radial. Our main intention here, far from presenting speciﬁc
and detailed models for individual SNRs, is to show in gen-
eral how radio polarization data could be eﬀectively used to
investigate similar objects; but, for the sake of illustration,
we shall consider here as an archetypal case the remnant of
SN 1006, which has been extensively studied, and of which
very detailed radio emission and polarization maps are now
available.

Polarization mapping

e.g.
Reynolds & Gilmore 1993) show that the direction of
the projected MF is approximately radial along the

source

(see

of

this

two brighter limbs (in the NE and SW sectors). This
pattern of polarization is clearly inconsistent with a
quasi-perpendicular model (if the MF stays ordered and
the internal FR is negligible), as shown for instance by
Schneiter et al. (2015), and may be easily inferred from our
Fig. 10. Instead, an ambiguity may remain between a quasi-
parallel case with ordered MF, and either a quasi-parallel or
a quasi-perpendicular case, but with the formation of radial
MF patterns (possibly due to the onset of instabilities),
especially in the brighter regions.

More recently, Reynoso et al. (2013) have shown that
the polarization along the two fainter edges of SN 1006 (in
the SE and NW sectors) is consistent with a tangential MF,
and that while the average fractional polarization of the two
bright limbs is about 17%, it typically increases along the
weaker limbs: for instance, in the SE sector it reaches a value
of about 60 ± 20% (this last value being consistent with
the theoretical limit of ≃ 71%, for a radio spectral index
≃ 0.6). Reynoso et al. (2013) interpret these results in the
framework of the quasi-parallel case, and in addition take
the lower polarization fraction in the two brighter limbs as
the signature of eﬃcient particle acceleration and generation
of magnetic turbulence in those regions.

However, in Sect. 2.3 we have shown that, in the case
of strong turbulence with an isotropic random MF in the
upstream, the shock compression would imply a strong
anisotropy in the immediate downstream turbulence, lead-
ing anyway to large polarization fractions (≃ 60% for typical
radio spectral indices, see Fig. 5), with a polarization consis-
tent with a preferential MF direction tangent to the shock
front. Therefore, except for very ﬁne tuned conditions, the
observation of typically radial patterns for the projected MF
seems to require the onset of Rayleigh-Taylor-like instabil-
ities, and for this reason we are going here to examine the
eﬀects of a preferentially radial MF, in the framework of a
barrel-like model.

For the sake of simplicity, we shall consider here a
monopole-like conﬁguration for the ordered MF. The radi-
ally oriented MF may actually have alternate orientations
in diﬀerent places; but this neither aﬀects the magnitude of
the synchrotron emissivity, nor its polarization. Similarly to
the standard quasi-perpendicular model, we shall use also
here the B ∝ sin θ prescription; but, diﬀerently from before,
here the only justiﬁcation is that in this way the azimuthal
dependence of the radio emission in SN 1006 can be roughly
reproduced. For the normalization of the particle energy dis-
tribution we will use again the sin2 θBn2 prescription, as in
the standard quasi-perpendicular case.

In Fig. 20, we show respectively the Stokes parameters
and the polarization in the absence of FR, with an aspect
angle of 60◦ (see Petruk et al. 2009, for estimates of the as-
pect angle for SN 1006). On the other hand, if as mentioned
above the radial MF reverses its orientation many times on
smaller scales, one should not be able to detect any net eﬀect
of this radial pattern on the FR; while only the FR originat-
ing from the meridional structure would not average to zero.
A strategy to tell apart the correct model could then involve
an analysis of the pattern of the internal RM, in order to
identify the symmetry axis of the underlying meridional MF.
In fact, the pattern of the RM, independently of the distri-
bution of the emitting particles, would allow one to identify
the symmetry axis of the MF meridional component (see e.g.

Fig. 17 or 18 for cases with large aspect angles). Therefore,
if an overall gradient of the RM is detected, it may indicate
the direction of the axis of symmetry of the SNR, and there-
fore if the radio emission from this source shows a bilateral
structure it would be interesting to check whether the two
directions are nearly parallel or nearly orthogonal. Of course,
this kind of analysis requires the absence of gradients in the
foreground FR (to be checked observing nearby polarized
background sources) as well as a not too distorted structure
for the SNR, therefore limiting the numbers of objects on
which such kind of analysis could be actually performed.

Finally, let us discuss the implications of the argument
presented by Rothenﬂug et al. (2004) to disprove a barrel-
like emission structure: stated in a qualitative way, they
noted that in a symmetric barrel-like structure one can quan-
tify a lower limit to the ratio of the emission near the pro-
jected center of the SNR and from the projected limbs. More
formally, they have ﬁrst considered a homogeneously emit-
ting annulus of radius r, and deﬁned Rλ (here, following
the notation in Rothenﬂug et al. 2004, the symbol λ is an
angle) as the ratio between the ﬂux of the regions whose pro-
jected distance from the symmetry axis is less than r sin λ,
and those with projected distance larger than r sin λ: in this
case, by purely geometrical arguments, this ratio is found
to be equal to π/(2λ) − 1; in particular, the authors use
λ = π/3, for which the ratio evaluates 0.5. Their last point
is that a generic distribution of the emission can be imag-
ined as the sum of more annuli, with diﬀerent radii, in which
case using that criterion for the largest radius gives a lower
limit to the global ratio Rπ/3 > 0.5).
Rothenﬂug et al. (2004), in the derivation of their crite-
rion, used the assumption of “isotropic radiation” (cf. their
Sect. A.1). This assumption, while apparently reasonable, in
fact requires the MF to be completely random and, among
others, it would be inconsistent with the presence of polar-
ized emission, as actually observed. On the other hand, if we
release this assumption the situation can change consider-
ably. In particular, Fig. 21 shows the case of an annulus seen
edge-on (now the orientation matters), for diﬀerent values
of the ratio between the random and ordered (radial) MF,
for some choices of the spectral index. It is apparent that,
while the asymptotic limit for large σ/ ¯B values is 0.5, inde-
pendently of the slope s, lower values are obtained for non
negligible values of the ordered component.

More insight can be obtained by computing the equa-
torial radial proﬁle for the model shown in Fig. 20 (with an
aspect angle of 60◦), for diﬀerent values of σ/ ¯B. It can be
seen that, while the emission near the projected center is
appreciable for large σ/ ¯B values (mostly random MF), in
the limit of a completely ordered radial MF (σ/ ¯B = 0) it
goes to vanish. In the lower panel of the same ﬁgure we show
the proﬁle of the fractional polarization. The fact that in the
bright limbs of SN 1006 a polarization fraction of ∼ 20% is
measured (Reynolds & Gilmore 1993; Reynoso et al. 2013),
this poses an upper limit of ≃ 1 to σ/ ¯B. Therefore, the ac-
tual proﬁle should be somehow dimmer near the center than
what estimated for a purely random MF.

In order to allow a closer comparison with the radio
proﬁles shown in Rothenﬂug et al. (2004), in Fig. 23 we also
present the proﬁles of the ﬂux, integrated along the direc-
tion orthogonal to the projected equator: in this case the
diﬀerences between models with diﬀerent σ/ ¯B values are

less evident, but still existing. In particular, one may see
from Fig. 23 that, in the fully ordered MF case, the inte-
grated I value on the symmetry axis is just about 40% of
the Rothenﬂug et al. (2004) case (i.e. σ/ ¯B = ∞). Therefore,
the criterion introduced in that paper cannot be intended by
itself as a mathematical proof against a barrel-like geometry.
In fact, in the case of a radially-oriented ordered component
of the MF, it would be oriented almost along the projec-
tion plane near the limbs and toward the observer near the
center, and this may result in smaller values of the ratio of
emission between center and limbs.

expect in the case of a laminar expansion into an ambi-
ent medium with a pre-existing homogeneous MF, having in
mind the case of young SNRs, and SN 1006 in particular, we
have also discussed the case of a radially oriented MF. We
have shown that the radial proﬁles of the emission may eﬀec-
tively depend also on the level of MF ﬂuctuations, so that
in the case of a low level of ﬂuctuations also a barrel-like
geometry of the emissivity could be consistent with lower
surface brightness near the central regions of the projected
image.

6 SUMMARY

In this paper we have presented a generalization of the classi-
cal treatment of the synchrotron radiation, valid in the case
in which the MF has a random component. The resulting
formulae, while nicely resembling those in the classical case,
are now valid for any relative level between ordered and ran-
dom component, and clearly show that the emission in the
case a partially random case cannot be simply modelled as
the sum of the emission in a fully ordered MF and that in a
completely random MF.

We have then used these formulae to model the syn-
chrotron emission from shell-type SNRs. The main limita-
tion of the present treatment is its applicability only to the
case in which the particle energy distribution is a power law,
and for this reason we have focussed our attention on the ra-
dio emission in SNRs. For the future we plan to extend this
treatment also to particle energy distributions with an up-
per cutoﬀ, and therefore to allow also an analysis of the non-
thermal SNR emission in the X-ray energy range. Another
limitation of this treatment is that the ﬂuctuations consid-
ered are on scales smaller that the instrumental resolution;
while for ﬂuctuations on larger scales the only possible ap-
proach is through multidimensional, high resolution, fully
numerical simulations.

Our goal here is instead to allow a numerically much
lighter treatment than full simulations, while still keeping
enough detail to allow investigations of several eﬀects. With
this aim, in order to model the emission from shell-type
SNRs we have introduced a thin-shell model. Our discus-
sion has involved various issues, like the dependence of the
typical polarized fractions on the level of MF ﬂuctuations,
and the pattern of the polarization as well as of the RM on
the geometry of the ordered MF component. We have also
introduced the idea that in the presence of internal FR the
measured RM maps contain an information diﬀerent from
that of the classical case, when FR is just due to a fore-
ground medium. In addition, we have also discussed further
eﬀects, on the observed direction of the polarization as well
as on its level, which should be more evident at longer ra-
dio wavelengths and which, if suitably tested in the future,
could provide additional information on the MF structure.
While this paper has been mostly devoted to cases with
a meridional geometry of the ordered MF, as one would
