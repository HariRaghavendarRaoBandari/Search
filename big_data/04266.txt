COPS AND ROBBERS ORDINALS OF COP-WIN TREES

ANTHONY BONATO, PRZEMYSŁAW GORDINOWICZ, AND GENA HAHN

Abstract. A relational characterization of cop-win graphs was provided by Nowakowski and
Winkler in their seminal paper on the game of Cops and Robbers. As a by-product of that
characterization, each cop-win graph is assigned a unique ordinal, which we refer to as a CR-
ordinal. For ﬁnite graphs, CR-ordinals correspond to the length of the game assuming optimal
play, with the cop beginning the game in a least favourable initial position. For inﬁnite graphs,
however, the possible values of CR-ordinals have not been considered in the literature until the
present work.

We classify the CR-ordinals of cop-win trees as either a ﬁnite ordinal, or those of the form
α + ω, where α is a limit ordinal. For general inﬁnite cop-win graphs, we provide an example
whose CR-ordinal is not of this form. We ﬁnish with some problems on characterizing the
CR-ordinals in the general case of cop-win graphs.

1. Introduction

In the game of Cops and Robbers, cop-win graphs are those for which one cop has a winning
strategy to capture the robber. Nowakowski and Winkler [16] were the ﬁrst ones to provide a
characterization of cop-win graphs that is not restricted to ﬁnite graphs. Consider an inﬁnite
graph G of order ℵα and write κ = ℵα+1, where α ≥ 0 is an ordinal. Deﬁne the relations {≤α}α<κ
on V(G) as follows (it is useful to remember that ≤α⊆ V(G) × V(G)). For a vertex v, let N[v]
be its closed neighbourhood.
(i) If u = v, then u ≤0 v.
(ii) u ≤α v if for all x ∈ N[u], there exists y ∈ N[v] such that x ≤β y for some β < α.
Observe that for all α < β, ≤α ⊆ ≤β. It follows that this tower of relations stabilizes at some
= ≤ρ+1. We refer to ρ as the CR-ordinal of

ordinal ρ ≤ κ; that is, there is a minimum ρ such ≤ρ
G. In the case G is a ﬁnite graph of order n, note that ρ ≤ n(n − 1).

A result of [16] that had often been overlooked is that the graph G is cop-win if and only
if the relation ≤κ is trivial (that is, ≤k = V(G) × V(G)). In this paper, we refer to ≤ρ as the
capture relation on cop-win graphs. The capture relation has provided insights into algorithms
for recognizing cop-win graphs [15], graphs with higher cop number [10], and for generalized
Cops and Robbers games [6]. It is not well-deﬁned for graphs whose cop number is greater
than one and that is one reason we still do not have a good characterization of k-cop-win
graphs, where k > 0.

For ﬁnite graphs, ρ(G) is an integer and is the length of the game assuming that the cop
and robber play optimally (that is, the cop plays to minimize the length of the game, while
the robber plays to maximize it), maximized over all possible starting positions for the cop. A
related notion is the capture time of G, which is the length of the game assuming optimal play
minimized over starting positions for the cop; see [4]. In the inﬁnite case, we can no longer

directly interpret the CR-ordinal as a length of a game. We emphasize that even in the inﬁnite
case, a cop captures a robber in a cop-win graph in ﬁnitely many rounds as there is no inﬁnite
descending sequence of ordinals.

Finite paths demonstrate that every non-negative integer can be a CR-ordinal. Not surpris-
ingly, the classiﬁcation of CR-ordinals for inﬁnite cop-win graphs is more complex. Indeed,
[5] suggests that the family of cop-win graphs is likely not classiﬁable as for each inﬁnite
cardinal ℵα there are the maximum possible number 2ℵα of non-isomorphic cop-win graphs of
order ℵα.

We say that an ordinal κ is a CR-ordinal if it is the CR-ordinal of some cop-win graph.
We denote the CR-ordinal of a given graph G by ρ(G). A basic question, therefore, is which
ordinals are CR-ordinals?

We provide a characterization of CR-ordinals for cop-win trees in Theorem 3.1. The cop-
win trees are precisely the rayless ones: trees not containing an inﬁnite path as a subgraph.
Theorem 3.1 shows that ﬁnite ordinals and the ordinals of the form α + ω, where ω is the
ﬁrst inﬁnite ordinal, are the CR-ordinals witnessed by cop-win trees. In the ﬁnal section, we
consider general cop-win graphs. We provide a family of cop-win graphs, inspired by the
graphs in [17], whose CR-ordinals are not those found from trees. Some open problems on the
classiﬁcation of CR-ordinals are stated at the end of the paper.

All the graphs we consider are simple and undirected. We assume the reader is (or will
be) familiar with the basic game of Cops and Robbers as deﬁned in, for example, [8, 16].
For additional background on Cops and Robbers and its variants, see the book [8] and the
surveys [1, 2, 3, 14]. For background on graph theory, see [12, 19]. We denote the distance
between vertices u and v by d(u, v). If u is a vertex and S a set of vertices, then d(u, S ) is the
minimum distance from u to a vertex in S . Let ON be the proper class of ordinals. We use
the property that every ordinal is the set of ordinals preceding it in the well ordering of ON.
For instance, ω consists of the set of all ﬁnite ordinals, and we use this notation throughout.
Hence, ω = N = {0, 1, 2, . . .}. We use the notation ω+ for ω \ {0}. Recall that a successor
ordinal is one which contains a maximum element; such ordinals are of the form α + 1, where
α is some ordinal. A limit ordinal is not a successor ordinal; for example, ω is a limit ordinal.
Transﬁnite induction is analogous to usual induction, but considers the cases of both successor
and limit ordinals. For further reading on ordinals and cardinals, see [11, 18].

2. Capture-time ordinal

Throughout this section, let G be a cop-win graph. Before we state our main result in the
next section, it will be useful to use the sequence {≤α}α≤ρ(G) to introduce a parameter that
provides a simpler means of computing ρ(G). Capture-time [4] is a temporal counterpart to
the cop number for a graph, measuring the length of the game assuming optimal play. We now
provide an ordinal analogue of capture-time.

For u, v ∈ V(G), deﬁne η(u, v) = α, where α is the minimum ordinal for which u ≤α v holds.
Note that η(u, v) is well-deﬁned as ordinals are well-ordered. If η(u, v) is ﬁnite, then we may
interpret it as the length of time it takes a cop on v to capture a robber on u, assuming both
play optimally. Note that the relation is not necessarily symmetric: η(u, v) may be diﬀerent
than η(v, u). For an example, see Figure 1 and its corresponding table of η values.

Deﬁne η(v) as the minimum ordinal α such that u ≤α v holds for every u ∈ V(G). Observe
that from the deﬁnitions, for any v ∈ V(G) we have that η(v) = supu∈V(G) η(u, v). Finally, we

deﬁne

η(G) = min
v∈V(G)

η(v).

When ﬁnite, η(G) is precisely the capture time [4] of the cop-win graph G, and, hence, we will
call such ordinals the capture-time ordinals associated with cop-win graphs.

A crucial observation (which follows from the deﬁnitions) is that

ρ(G) = sup
v∈V(G)

η(v).

In particular, in the ﬁnite case, ρ(G) is the maximum capture time over all initial positions of
the cop.

Deﬁne θ(G) to be the set of vertices that realize η(G); namely

θ(G) = {v ∈ V(G): η(v) = η(G)}.

Note that by the deﬁnitions, θ(G) , ∅. We may view the set θ(G) as the vertices which are
optimal starting positions for the cop. For example, in a ﬁnite tree T , θ(T ) is the centre of the
tree.

As we have just introduced a number of graph parameters, we give an example that illus-
trates them. Consider the tree T depicted in Figure 1, along with its table of η-values. Note

that by considering the table, we derive that ρ(T ) = 5, η(T ) = 3, and θ(T ) = {r, x31}.

To further explore the capture-time ordinals, we consider the following example. Deﬁne the

tree Tω

= (V(Tω), E(Tω)) by setting

V(Tω) = {r} ∪ {xi, j : i, j < ω+, j ≤ i}

and

E(Tω) = (cid:8){r, xi,1} : i < ω+}(cid:9) ∪ (cid:8){xi, j, xi, j+1} : i, j < ω+, j < i(cid:9).

In other words, for each positive integer n attach a path of length n to the root vertex r. The tree
Tω is suggested in Figure 2. The tree Tω possesses no ray and so is cop-win. However, the rob-
ber may choose starting position any given end-vertex, making the capture-time unbounded.
We now make this precise in the setting of CR-ordinals. Note that

η(xi( j+k), xi j) = i − j for any i, j, k ∈ ω+ such that j + k ≤ i.

Hence, we have that

η(xi j, r) = i for any i, j < ω+, j ≤ i.

4

Figure 2. The tree Tω.

For any v ∈ V(Tω) there exists an i < ω such that v ≤i r. Further, for any i < ω there exists

a v ∈ V(Tω) such that v ≤i r does not hold. Thus, we have that η(r) = ω.

It is straightforward to derive that for any i < ω+, η(r, xi1) = ω. Further, for any vertex
v ∈ V(Tω), v ≤ω xi1. Actually, regardless of the robber’s moves, the cop can move to r. Hence,
for any i < ω+ we have that η(xi1) = ω.

In addition, for i, j < ω+, j ≤ i, η(r, xi j) = ω + j − 1. Note that for any vertex v ∈ V(Tω)
we have v ≤ω+ j−1 xi j. In addition, for some v, η(v, xi j) may be smaller than ω + j − 1. Hence,
η(xi j) = ω + j − 1.

By the above observations, we ﬁnd that for all positive integers t, there are vertices x with
η(x) = ω + t. Hence, we have the perhaps surprising conclusion that ρ(Tω) = ω + ω = ω · 2.
Note that η(Tω) = ω, while θ(Tω) = {r} ∪ {xi1 : i < ω+}.

An analogous argument works for any inﬁnite tree obtained by attaching any cardinal num-
ber of ﬁnite paths to a common root, provided the path lengths are unbounded. Such trees may
be uncountable. This gives examples of uncountable graphs with η(G) = ω · 2 (see also the
construction in the next section).

3. The classification of CR-ordinals for trees

The main result of the paper is the following theorem. Deﬁne
ΛT = (cid:8)ρ(T ): T is a cop-win tree(cid:9).

Theorem 3.1. A CR-ordinal for a cop-win tree is either a ﬁnite ordinal, or of the form α + ω,
where α is a limit ordinal. In particular,

ΛT = ω ∪ (cid:8)α + ω : α is a limit ordinal(cid:9).

The proof of Theorem 3.1 is divided into two parts: necessity (see Lemmas 3.2 and 3.3)
and suﬃciency (see Lemma 3.4). For necessity, the main idea of the proof is to determine the
relationship between the values of η(T ), ρ(T ) and the radius of the given tree. For suﬃciency,
we give a transﬁnite construction of trees whose CR-ordinals have values in ΛT .

We ﬁrst present a lemma which is essentially a part of folklore. We omit the proof as it is

straightforward.
Lemma 3.2. Let T be a tree with ﬁnite radius. Then η(T ) equals the radius of T , and ρ(T )
equals the diameter of T . In particular, ρ(T ) is a ﬁnite ordinal.

COPS AND ROBBERS ORDINALS OF COP-WIN TREES

The next lemma complements the above for the necessity part of Theorem 3.1.

Lemma 3.3. If T is a cop-win tree with inﬁnite radius, then η(T ) is inﬁnite and ρ(T ) = η(T )+ω.

In the proof we heavily use that in a tree, an optimal cop strategy is always to go directly
towards the robber using the unique geodesic connecting the two players’ vertices. Observe
that this greedy strategy of the cops may not be optimal for other graph classes. See the results
on the game of Zombies and Survivors [7, 13].

Proof. As η(u, v) ≥ d(u, v) for any two vertices u, v ∈ V(T ), we derive immediately that η(T )
is inﬁnite.

We claim that the set θ(T ) induces a subtree of T with diameter at most two. Now, if
θ(T ) contains more than one vertex, let u and v be distinct vertices in θ(T ). If u and v are
not adjacent, then let w be any vertex on the unique uv-path. Note that vertex w has the
property that for any vertex x ∈ V(T ) at least one of ux-path or vx-path contains vertex w.
Therefore, vertex w is also contained in the set θ(T ). Hence, the subgraph induced by θ(T ) in
T is connected.

By rechoosing u and v if necessary, suppose for a contradiction that the length of the uv-
path is three; say the path is uu′v′v. Let Tu, Tv be the two disjoint subtrees obtained from
T by removing edge {u′, v′}, such that u ∈ V(Tu) and v ∈ V(Tv), respectively. Notice that
u′ ∈ θ(T ) implies that either η(v′, u′) = η(T ), or for each ordinal α < η(T ), there exists a vertex
w ∈ V(Tu) such that η(w, u′) > α. The second case, however, implies that η(u′, v′) ≥ η(T ). As
v′ ∈ θ(T ) as well, we have that η(v′, u′) = η(T ) or η(u′, v′) = η(T ). But then we have that

η(u) ≥ η(v′, u) > η(T ) or η(v) ≥ η(u′, v) > η(T ),

which contradicts that both u and v are contained in the set θ(T ). Hence, the claim concerning
θ(T ) follows.

By induction we have that for any vertex v ∈ V(T ) \ θ(T ), we have that

η(v) = η(T ) + d(v, θ(T )).

As the radius of the tree is inﬁnite while the diameter of the subgraph induced by θ(T ) is ﬁnite,
for any n < ω there exists some vertex v ∈ V(T ) such that d(v, θ(T )) > n. Hence, we derive
that ρ(T ) = η(T ) + ω.

(cid:3)

By elementary ordinal arithmetic, we may assume that η in the sum η + ω is a limit ordinal.
This follows since every successor ordinal is of the form α + k, where α is a limit ordinal, and
k is a ﬁnite ordinal.

To prove Theorem 3.1, it is enough to construct a family of trees with CR-ordinals taking all
values in the set ω ∪ (cid:8)α + ω : α is a limit ordinal(cid:9). Finding examples of trees with CR-ordinals
equalling all the ﬁnite, non-zero ordinals is straightforward. For this, consider the family of
ﬁnite paths {Pn}n≥2: Lemma 3.2 implies that η(Pn) = ⌈ n−1

2 ⌉ and ρ(Pn) = n − 1.

We now turn to our construction in the inﬁnite case. We construct a family {Tα : α ∈ ON},
such that for any α ∈ ON we have that η(Tα) = α. This construction, in light of Lemma 3.3,
will complete the proof of Theorem 3.1.

The construction is based on the operation of summing rooted trees. The basic idea is to
form a new root, then append trees to the root by new edges. To be precise, suppose that
{(Ti, ri) : i ∈ α} is a set of disjoint rooted trees indexed by the ordinal α. Form the rooted tree
Li∈α(Ti, ri) be adding a new vertex r that is joined to each of the ri.

6

ANTHONY BONATO, PRZEMYSŁAW GORDINOWICZ, AND GENA HAHN

We construct our examples by transﬁnite induction. Let S 1 = (K1, r1) with r1 equalling the
single vertex. For any ordinal α > 1, assume that all the rooted trees (S α, rα) are deﬁned. Let
S α be the rooted tree Li<α(S i, ri), whose root we denote rα.
refer to these as S α.

See the Figure 3 for the ﬁrst four trees in the family {(S α, rα) : α ∈ ON}. For simplicity, we

Figure 3. The rooted trees S 1, S 2, S 3 and S 4, with roots coloured black.

As an aside, by Lemma 3.2, we have that for n < ω, η(S n+1) = n and ρ(S n+1) = 2n − 1.

Lemma 3.4. For α ∈ ON we have that η(S α+1) = α.

Note that taking Tα

= S α+1 for α ∈ ON \ ω constructs the desired family.

Proof. We prove a slightly stronger statement; namely that for any α ∈ ON there exists a vertex
v ∈ V(S α+1) such that

η(S α+1) = η(rα+1) = η(v, r) = α

and, when α is a limit ordinal, there is η(S α) = η(rα) = α.

We proceed by transﬁnite induction on α, with case α = 1 being trivially true. Assume that
for some α ∈ ON and for all β < α one has η(S β+1) = β, and η(rβ+1) = η(rβ+1, vβ+1) = β, for
some vβ+1 ∈ V(S β+1) and for all limit β < α there is η(S β) = η(rβ) = β.

Let α = β + 1 be a successor ordinal. By construction, we see that (S α+1, rα+1) is consisted
of the two copies of (S β+1, rβ+1) on disjoint vertex sets, say (S , r) and (S ′, r′) joined by the edge
{r, r′}, with rα+1 = r.

Consider the capture relation in S α+1. Note that every non-leaf vertex of a tree is a cut vertex;
hence, the cop can forbid the robber to enter any component (that is, subtree) except the one
occupied by the robber. Therefore, using the induction hypothesis, we have that η(u, r) ≤ β
for all u ∈ V(S ) and that there exists v ∈ V(S ′) such that η(v, r′) = β, while η(u, r′) ≤ β for all
u ∈ V(S ′). Since r′ is a neighbour of r we have that η(v, r) ≤ β + 1 for any v ∈ V(S α+1), while
η(r′, r) = β + 1.

Observe that η(r′, v) ≥ η(r′, r) for any v ∈ V(S ) and, by the symmetry, for any v ∈ V(S ′) we

have that η(r, v) ≥ η(r, r′) = β + 1. Hence,

η(S α+1) = η(r) = η(r′, r) = β + 1 = α.

Now let α be a limit ordinal. Using the induction hypothesis it is straightforward to see
that in (S α, rα) = Lβ<α(S β, rβ), for any ordinal β < α there exist a neighbour of rα, namely
rβ+1, such that η(rβ+1, rα) = β + 1. On the other hand, for any v ∈ V(S α) \ {rα} we have that
v ∈ V(S β), for some β < α, hence there is η(v, r) ≤ β + 1 < α. Therefore, we have that
η(rα) = α, while for any vertex v ∈ V(S α) we have that η(v, rα) < α. Moreover, we ﬁnd that
η(rα, v) ≥ α, for v ∈ V(S α) \ {rα}. This follows since a robber on rα may choose to escape to
any neighbour of rα except at most the one leading towards vertex v, on which the cop stay.
Hence, η(S α) = α = η(rα).

COPS AND ROBBERS ORDINALS OF COP-WIN TREES

To ﬁnish this case consider tree (S α+1, rα+1) as two copies of (S α, rα) on disjoint vertex sets,
say (S , r) and (S ′, r′) joined by the edge {r, r′}, with rα+1 = r. By considering capture relation
on S α+1, we see that η(r′, r) = α, while for any vertex v ∈ V(S α+1) there is η(v, r) ≤ α. Of
course there is η(r′, v) ≥ η(r′, r) for any v ∈ V(S ) and, by the symmetry, for any v ∈ V(S ′) we
have that η(r, v) ≥ η(r, r′) = α.

Hence, we have that

and the proof follows.

Deﬁne

η(S α+1) = η(r) = η(r′, r) = α,

4. General cop-win graphs

(cid:3)

Of course, ΛT ⊆ Λ. However, the containment is strict as we describe in the following exam-
ple.

Λ = (cid:8)ρ(G): G is a cop-win graph(cid:9).

Consider the following cop-win graph introduced in [17], which we refer to as the Polat
graph. Let X = {xn : n < ω}, Y = {yn : n < ω}, and Z = {z} be disjoint sets of vertices. Let G
be the graph deﬁned by V(G) = X ∪ Y ∪ Z and

E(G) = [

n<ω

(cid:16){xn, xn+1}, {xn, z}, {xn, yn}, {xn, yn+1}, {xn, yn+2}, {xn, yn+3}(cid:17).

The Polat graph is suggested in Figure 4. By direct checking, we have that ρ(G) = ω + 1,

Figure 4. The Polat graph.

η(G) = ω and θ(G) = X ∪ Z (we omit the details here). Hence, the Polat graph witnesses the
fact that ω + 1 ∈ Λ \ ΛT .

We may modify the construction of the Polat graph in several ways to obtain other CR-
ordinals. For example, we may add a ﬁnite path to the vertex z obtaining graphs with CR-
ordinal equalling ω + i, for i < ω+. By forming a sum (akin to the rooted tree sum described in
the previous section) of these generalized Polat graphs, for j < ω, j > 1, there exist cop-win
graphs with CR-ordinal ω · j + (i + j).

5. Problems

The main open problem we consider is to classify which ordinals belong to Λ. Deﬁne

Υ = (cid:8)ω · i + (i + j): i, j < ω} ∪ (cid:8)α + ω : α is a limit ordinal(cid:9).

8

ANTHONY BONATO, PRZEMYSŁAW GORDINOWICZ, AND GENA HAHN

Our family of cop-win graphs derived from the Polat graph supports the assertion that Λ = Υ.
We leave this as an open problem. Some ordinals do not seem possible to attain as a CR-
ordinal. For example, is ω ∈ Λ? Note that this question is answered negatively if Λ = Υ.

We mention in closing that the paper [16] fails to distinguish between cardinals and ordinals
(though its results are correct when the distinction is made). Further, we do not know the best
upper bound on the tower of relations {≤α}α<ℵα+1 for a graph G of cardinality ℵα.
