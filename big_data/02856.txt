ENRICO BOASSO

Abstract. We consider the complex solvable non-commutative two dimen-
sional Lie algebra L, L =< y > ⊕ < x >, with Lie bracket [x, y] = y, as linear
bounded operators acting on a complex Hilbert space H. Under the assump-
tion R(y) closed, we reduce the computation of the joint spectra Sp(L, E),
σδ,k(L, E) and σπ,k(L, E), k = 0, 1, 2, to the computation of the spectrum, the
approximate point spectrum, and the approximate compression spectrum of
a single operator. Besides, we also study the case y2 = 0, and we apply our
results to the case H ﬁnite dimensional.

1. Introduction

In [1] we introduced a joint spectrum for complex solvable ﬁnite dimensional
Lie algebras of operators acting on a Banach space E. If L is such an algebra, and
Sp(L, E) denotes its joint spectrum, Sp(L, E) is a compact non empty subset of
L∗, which also satisﬁes the projection property for ideals, i. e., if I is an ideal of
L and Π : L∗ → I ∗ denotes the restriction map, then Sp(I, E) = Π(Sp(L, E)). In
addition, when L is a commutative algebra, Sp(L, E) reduces to the Taylor joint
spectrum, see [5]. Moreover, in [2] we extended S lodkowski joint spectra σδ,k and
σπ,k to the case under consideration and we proved the usual spectral properties:
they are compact non empty subsets of L∗ and the projection property for ideals
still holds.

In this paper we consider the complex solvable non-commutative two dimen-
sional Lie algebra L, L =< y > ⊕ < x >, with Lie bracket [x, y] = y, as bounded
linear operators acting on a complex Hilbert space H, and we compute the joint
spectra Sp(L, H), σδ,k(L, H) and σπ,k(L, H), for k = 0, 1, 2, when R(y) is a closed
subspace of H. Besides, by means of an homological argument, we reduce the
computation of these spectra to the one dimensional case. We prove that these
joint spectra are determined by the spectrum, the approximate point spectrum,
and the approximate compression spectrum of x in Ker(y) and x in H/R(y),
where x is the quotient map associated to x, (R(y) and Ker(y) are invariant
subspaces for the operator x).

In addition, we consider the case y2 = 0 (it easy to see that y is a nilpotent op-
erator), and we obtain a relation between the spectrum of x in R(y) and a subset
of the spectrum of x in H/R(y), which give us a more precise characterization of
the joint spectrum Sp(L, E). Finally, we apply our computation to the case H
ﬁnite dimensional.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review several deﬁnitions
and results of [1] and [2]. In Section 3 we prove our main theorems and, in Section
4, we consider the case y2 = 0 and the ﬁnite dimensional case.

2. Preliminaries

In this section we brieﬂy recall the deﬁnitions of the joint spectra Sp(L, H),
σδ,k(L, H) and σπ(L, H), k = 0, 1, 2. We restrict ourselves to the case under
consideration. For a complete account of the deﬁnitions and mean properties of
these joint spectra, see [1] and [2].

From now on, let L be the complex solvable two dimensional Lie algebra,
L =< y > ⊕ < x >, with Lie bracket [x, y] = y, which acts as right continuous
linear operators on a Hilbert space H, i. e., L is a Lie subalgebra of L(H)op, where
L(H) is the algebra of all bounded linear operators deﬁned on H, and where
L(H)op means that we consider L(H) with its opposite product. We observe
that any complex solvable non-commutative two dimensional Lie algebra may be
presented in the above form.

If f is a character of L, we consider the chain complex (H ⊗ ∧L, d(f )), where

∧L denotes the exterior algebra of L, and d(f ) is the following map:

dp−1(f ) : H ⊗ ∧pL → H ⊗ ∧p−1L,

d0(f )(a < y >) = y(a),

d0(f )(b < x >) = (x − f (x))(b),

d1(f )(c < yx >) = (−(x − 1 − f (x)))(c) < y > +y(c) < x > .

Let H∗(H ⊗ ∧L, d(f )) denote the homology of the complex (H ⊗ ∧L, d(f )), we
now state our ﬁrst deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.1. With H, L and f as above, the set {f ∈ L∗ : f (L2) = 0, H∗(H ⊗
∧L, d(f )) 6= 0}, is the joint spectrum of L acting on H, and it is denoted by
Sp(L, H).

As a consequence of the results of [1], we have that Sp(L, H) is a compact non
empty subset of L∗. Besides, as a standard calculation shows that the equality
y = [x, y]op = [y, x] implies nyn = [yn, x] = [x, yn]op, we have that y is a nilpotent
operator. Thus, Sp(< y >) = 0, and by the projection property, if f belongs to
Sp(L, H), as < y >= L2 is an ideal of L, f (y) = 0.

Now, let us consider the basis of L, A, deﬁned by, A = {y, x}, and B, the basis
of L∗ dual of A. If we consider Sp(L, H) in terms of the above basis, and we
denote it by Sp((y, x), H), i. e., Sp((y, x), H) = {(f (y), f (x)) : f ∈ Sp(L, H)},
we have that, Sp((y, x), H) = {(0, f (x)) : f ∈ Sp(L, H)}.

In addition, the complex (H ⊗ ∧L, d(f )) may be written in the following way,

0 → H d1−→ H ⊕ H d0−→ H → 0,

d0 = (cid:0)y x − λ(cid:1) ,

d1 = (cid:18)−(x − 1 − λ)

y

(cid:19) ,

where λ = f (x). We denote this chain complex by (C, d(λ)). Thus, as (0, λ) ∈
Sp((y, x), H) if and only if f ∈ Sp(L, H), where λ = f (x), to compute the latter

is equivalent to compute the former, and to study the exactness of the chain
complex (H ⊗ ∧L, d(f )) is equivalent to study the exactness of (C, d(λ)).

With regard to the joint spectra σδ,k(L, H) and σπ,k(L, H), k = 0, 1, 2, we
review, for the case under consideration, the deﬁnition of them given in [2]. If
p = 0, 1, 2, let Σp(L, H) be the set Σp(L, H) = {f ∈ L∗ : f (L2) = 0, Hp((H ⊗
∧L, d(f ))) 6= 0}. We now state our second deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.2. With H, L and f as above,

σδ,k(L, H) = [0≤p≤k

Σ(L, H),

σπ,k(L, H) = [k≤p≤2

Σp(L, H)[{f ∈ L∗ : f (L2) = 0, R(dk(f ))is not closed},

where 0 ≤ k ≤ 2.

We observe that Sp(L, H) = σδ,2(L, H) = σπ,0(L, H). Besides, as we have
said, these joint spectra are compact non empty subsets of L∗.
In addition,
as in the case of the joint spectrum Sp(L, H), we consider the joint spectra
σδ,k(L, H) and σπ,k(L, H) in terms of the basis A and B. As these joint spectra are
subsets of Sp(L, H), we have that σδ,k((y, x), H) = {(0, f (x)) : f ∈ σδ,k(L, H)},
and σπ,k((y, x), H) = {(0, f (x)) : f ∈ σπ,k(L, H)}, where k = 0, 1, 2.

Moreover, as in the case of the joint spectrum Sp(L, H), to compute σδ,k(L, H)
and σπ,k(L, H), 0 ≤ k ≤ 2, is equivalent to compute these joint spectra in terms
of the basis A and B. Finally, to compute the latter joint spectra it is enough
to study the complex (C, d(λ)), and to consider the corresponding properties
involved in the deﬁnition of σδ,k(L, H) and σπ,k(L, H), 0 ≤ k ≤ 2, for it.

3. The Main Result

We begin with the characterization of Sp(L, H). Indeed, we consider Sp((y, x), H),

and by means of an homological argument we reduce its computation to the case
of a single operator.

Let us consider the chain complex (C, d),

0 → H

d=y
−−→ H → 0.

Then an easy calculation shows that we have a short exact sequence of chain
complex of the form,

0 → (C, d) i−→ (C, d(λ))

p
−→ (C, d) → 0,

where (ij)(0≤j≤2) and (pj)(0≤j≤2) are the following maps: i2 = 0, i1 = IH ⊕ 0,
i0 = IH, and p2 = IH, p1 = 0 ⊕ IH, p0 = 0.

Thus, by [4, Chapter II, Section 4, Theorem 4.1], and the fact that p is a map

of degree −1, we have a long exact sequence of homology spaces of the form,

→ Hq(C, d(λ))

pq∗
−−→ Hq−1(C, d)

∂q−1−−→ Hq−1(C, d)

iq−1∗
−−−→ Hq−1(C, d(λ)) → .

We observe that H1(C, d) = Ker(y) and that H0(C, d) = H/R(y). Moreover,
as [x, y]op = y, we have that x(R(y)) ⊆ R(y) and that x(Ker(y)) ⊆ Ker(y).

Then, by [4, Chapter II, Section 4, Theorem 4.1], ∂q, q = 0, 1, are the following
maps: ∂0([a]) = [(x − λ)(a)] = (x − λ)[a], and ∂1(b) = −(x − λ − 1)(b), where
x : H/R(y) → H/R(y) is the map obtained by passing x to the quotient space
H/R(y). We now give our characterization of Sp(L, H).

Proposition 3.1. Let L be the complex solvable non-commutative two dimen-
sional Lie algebra L =< y > ⊕ < x >, with Lie bracket [x,y]=y, which acts
as right continuous linear operators on a complex Hilbert space H. If R(y) is a
closed subspace of H and we consider Sp(L, H) in terms of the basis {y, x} of L
and the basis of L∗ dual of the latter, then we have,

Sp((y, x), H) = {0} × Sp(x − 1, Ker(y)) ∪ {0} × Sp(x, H/R(y)).

In addition, we have:

(i) H0(C, d(λ)) = 0 iﬀ x − λ : H/R(y) → H/R(y) is a surjective map,
(ii) H2(C, d(λ)) = 0 iﬀ x − 1 − λ : ker(y) → Ker(y) is an injective map,
(iii) H1(C, d(λ)) = 0 iﬀ x − 1 − λ is injective, and x − λ − 1 is surjective.
Proof. It is a consequence of the long exact sequence of homology spaces and the
form of the maps ∂j, j = 0, 1.
(cid:3)

In order to characterize the joint spectra σπ,k(L, H), we recall the notion of
approximate point spectrum of an operator T : λ is in the approximate point
spectrum of T , which we denote by Π(T ), if there exists a sequence of unit
vectors, (xn)n∈N, xn ∈ H, k xn k= 1, such that (T − λ)(xn) → 0 (n → ∞). An
easy calculation shows that λ /∈ Π(T ) if and only if Ker(T − λ) = 0 and R(T − λ)
is closed in H.

We now consider the spectrum σπ,2((y, x), H). We observe that, as [x, y]op = y,
(x − 1)(Ker(y) ⊆ Ker(y). Then, we may consider Π(x − 1, Ker(y)). Indeed, we
shall see that σπ,2((y, x), H) = {0} × Π(x − 1, Ker(y)).

To prove the last assertion we proceed as follows. By Deﬁnition 2, we have
that σc
π,2 = {(0, λ) : H2(C, d(λ)) = 0 and R(d1(λ)) is closed}. However, by the
deﬁnition of d1(λ) and H2(C, d(λ)), H2(C, d(λ)) = Ker(x − 1 − λ) ∩ Ker(y).
Then, H2(C, d(λ)) = 0 is equivalent to Ker(x − 1 − λ |Ker(y))= 0. Thus, in order
to conclude with our assertion, it is enough to see that the fact R(x−1−λ |Ker(y))
is closed, is equivalent to R(d1(λ)) is closed.

Indeed, if (an)n∈N is a sequence in Ker(y) such that (x − 1 − λ)(an) → b ∈
Ker(y) (n → ∞), we have that, d1(λ)(an) → (−b, 0) (n → ∞). If R(d1(λ)) is
closed, there is a z in H such that d1(λ)(z) = (−b, 0), i.e., −(x − 1 − λ)(z) = −b
and y(z) = 0. Thus, z ∈ Ker(y) and R((x − 1 − λ) |Ker(y)) is closed.

On the other hand, if R((x − 1 − λ |Ker(y)) is closed, let us consider a se-
quence (zn)n∈N, zn ∈ H, such that d1(λ)(zn) → (w1, w2) ∈ H ⊕ H (n → ∞).
We decompose H as the orthogonal direct sum of Ker(y) and Ker(y)⊥, H =
Ker(Y )⊕Ker(y)⊥. Let (an)n∈N and (bn)n∈N be sequences in Ker(y) and Ker(y)⊥,
respectively, such that zn = an + bn. Then,

d1(λ) = d1(λ)(an) + d1(λ)(bn)

= (−(x − 1 − λ)(an), 0) + (−(x − 1 − λ)(bn), y(bn)),

TWO DIMENSIONAL LIE ALGEBRA OF OPERATORS

where y : Ker(y)⊥ → R(y) is the restriction of y to Ker(y)⊥. We observe that,
as R(y) is a closed subspace of H, y is a topological homeomorphism. Besides, as
y(bn) → w2 (n → ∞), there exists a z2 ∈ Ker(y)⊥ such that bn → z2 (n → ∞),
and y(z2) = w2. Then, −(x − 1 − λ)(bn) → −(x − 1 − λ)(z2) (n → ∞), and
−(x − 1 − λ)(an) → w1 + (x − 1 − λ)(z2) (n → ∞). As (an)n∈N is a sequence
in Ker(y), and R(x − 1 − λ |Ker(y)) is closed, there is a z1 ∈ Ker(y) such that
w1 + (x − 1 − λ)(z2) = −(x − 1 − λ)(z1). Thus, (w1, w2) = d1(λ)(z1 + z2),
equivalently, R(d1(λ)) is a closed subspace of H ⊕ H.

With regard to σπ,1((y, x), H), we have, by Deﬁnition 2.2, that,
σπ,1((y, x), H)c = {(0, λ) : Hi(C, d(λ)) = 0, i = 1, 2, and R(d0(λ)) is closed},

which, by Proposition 1, is equivalent to the following conditions:
(i) x − 1 − λ : Ker(y) → Ker(y) is an isomorphic map,
(ii) x − λ : H/R(y) → H/R(y) is an injective map,
(iii) R(d0(λ)) is closed.

We shall see that σπ,1((y, x), H) = Sp(x − 1, Ker(y)) ∪ Π(x, H/R(y)).
Indeed, it is clear that condition (i) is equivalent to λ /∈ Sp(x − 1, Ker(y)).
Then, it is enough to see that condition (ii)-(iii) are equivalent to λ /∈ Π(x, H/R(y)
). However, by (ii), it suﬃces to verify that the fact R(d0)(λ) is closed is equivalent
to R(x − λ) is closed. Now, as the quotient map, Π : H → H/R(y), is an identiﬁ-
cation, by [3, Chapter II, Section 6, Lemma 6.1], R = R(x − λ) = Π(R(x − λ)) is
closed in H/R(y) if and only if Π−1(R) = R(x − λ) + R(y) = R(d0(λ)) is closed
in H.

In order to study the joint spectra σδ,k(L, H), k = 0, 1, 2, we recall the deﬁnition
of the approximate compression Spectrum of an operator T in H: λ is in the
approximate compression spectrum of T , which we denote by ΠC(T ), if there
exists a sequence of unit vectors in H, (xn)n∈N, xn ∈ H, k xn k= 1, such that
(T − λ)∗(xn) → 0 (n → ∞), i. e., ΠC(T ) = Π(T ∗). Besides, an easy calculation
shows that λ does not belong to Π(T ) if and only if (T − λ) is a surjective map.
We now consider the joint spectra σδ,o((y, x), H). However, by Deﬁniton 2.2,
Proposition 3.1 and the previous considerations about the approximate compres-
sion spectrum, it is clear that σδ,k((y, x), H) = {0} × ΠC(x, H/R(y)).

With regards to σδ,1((y, x), H), by Deﬁnition 2.2 and Proposition 3.1, we have
that (0, λ) does not belong to σδ,1((y, x), H) if and only if (0, λ) satisﬁes the
following conditions:
(i) x − λ : H/R(y) → H/R(y) is an isomorphic map,
(ii) x − 1 − λ : Ker(y) → Ker(y) is surjective.

Then, it is obvious that σδ,1((y, x), H) = {0} × Sp(x, H/R(y)) ∪ {0} × ΠC(x −

1 |Ker(y)).

We now summarize our results.

Theorem 3.2. Let L be the complex solvable non-commutative two dimensional
Lie algebra, L =< y > ⊕ < x >, with Lie bracket [x, y]op = y, which acts as right
continuous linear operators on a complex Hilbert space H. If R(y) is closed, then
the joint spectra Sp(L, H), σδ,k(L, H) and σπ,k(L, H), k = 0, 1, 2, in terms of the
basis {y, x} of L and the basis of L∗ dual of the latter, may be characterize as
follows:

6

ENRICO BOASSO

(i) Sp((y, x), H) = {0} × Sp(x − 1, Ker(y)) ∪ {0} × Sp(x, H/R(y)),
(ii) σδ,0((y, x), H) = {0} × ΠC(x, H/R(y)),
(iii) σδ,1((y, x)) = {0} × Sp(x, H/R(y)) ∪ {0} × ΠC(x − 1, Ker(y)),
(iv) σπ,2((y, x), H) = {0} × Π(x − 1, Ker(y)),
(v) σπ,1((y, x), H) = {0} × Sp(x − 1, Ker(y)) ∪ {0} × Π(x, H/R(y)),
(vi) σδ,2((y, x), H) = σπ,0((y, x), H) = Sp((y, x), H).

4. A Special Case

As we have seen, y is a nilpotent operator. In this section we study the case y2 =
0 and we obtain a more precise characterization of th joint spectrum Sp(L, H).
We decompose H in the following way: H = Ker(y) ⊕ Ker(y)⊥. Besides,
as R(y) is contained in Ker(y), let us consider M, the closed subspace of H
deﬁned by M = Ker(y) ∩ R(y)⊥. Then we have another orthogonal direct sum
decomposition of H, H = R(y) ⊕ M ⊕ Ker(y)⊥. Moreover, if we recall that
x(R(y)) ⊆ R(y) and x(Ker(y)) ⊆ Ker(y), then we have that x and y have the
following form,

y = 


0 0 y
0 0 0
0 0 0


 ,

x = 


x11 x12 x13
x22 x23
0
0
0
x33


 ,

where y is as in Section 3 and the maps xij ,1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ 2, are the restriction of
x to the corresponding spaces. We now see that, in the case under consideration,
Sp(L, H) reduces essentially to the spectrum of x in Ker(y).

Proposition 4.1. Let L be the complex solvable non commutative two dimen-
sional Lie algebra L =< y > ⊕ < x >, with Lie bracket [x, y]op = y, which acts
as right continuous linear operators on a complex Hilbert space H. If R(y) is
closed and y2 = 0, Sp(L, H), in terms of the basis {y, x} of L and the basis of
L∗ dual of the latter, may be described as follows. If x11 and x22 are the maps
deﬁned above, and if Si, i = 1, 2, are the sets: S1 = (Sp(x11, R(y)) − 1), and
S2 = (Sp(x22, R(y)⊥ ∩ Ker(y)), then, we have that,

Sp((y, x), H) = {0} × (S1 ∪ (S1 + 2) ∪ S2 ∪ (S2 − 1)).

Proof. An easy calculation shows that the relation [x, y]op = y is equivalent
to yx33 − x11y = y. However, as y is a topological homeomorphism, x33 =
IKer(y)⊥ + y−1x11y. In particular, Sp(x33, Ker(y)⊥) = Sp(x11, R(y)) + 1. Then, as
Sp(x, H/R(y)) = Sp(x22, M) ∪ Sp(x33, Ker(y)⊥), where M = R(y)⊥ ∩ Ker(y),we
have that Sp(x, H/R(y)) = (S1 + 2) ∪ S2.

On the other hand, it is clear that Sp(x − 1, Ker(y)) = S1 ∪ (S2 − 1). Thus,
(cid:3)

by Theorem 1, we conclude the proof.

Finally, we consider the case R(y) closed, y2 = 0, and H ﬁnite dimensional. If
r = dim(R(y)) and k = dim(Ker(y)), let us chose a basis of Ker(y) such that
the ﬁrst r-vectors of it are a basis of R(y), and in this basis, x has an upper
triangular form, with diagonal entries λii, 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Then we have the following
corollary.

Corollary 4.2. Let H, L and the operator y be as in Proposition 4.1. If H is
ﬁnite dimensional and we consider a basis of Ker(y) with the above conditions,
Sp(L, H), in terms of the basis of L and L∗ considered in Proposition 4.1, is the
following set,

Sp((y, x), H) = {0} × {(λii − 1)(1≤i≤k) ∪ (λii)(m≤i≤k) ∪ (λii + 1)(1≤i≤m)}.
