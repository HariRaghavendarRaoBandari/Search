Introduction

Fredholm operators are one of the most important classes of linear operators in mathematics.

They were introduced around 1900 in the study of integral operators and by deﬁnition they

share many properties with linear operators between ﬁnite dimensional spaces. They appear
naturally in global analysis which is a branch of pure mathematics concerned with the global

and topological properties of systems of diﬀerential equations on manifolds. One of the basic
important facts says that every linear elliptic diﬀerential operator acting on sections of a vector

bundle over a closed manifold induces a Fredholm operator on a suitable Banach space comple-
tion of bundle sections. Every Fredholm operator has an integer-valued index, which is invariant

under deformations of the operator, and the most fundamental theorem in global analysis is the
Atiyah-Singer index theorem [AS68] which gives an explicit formula for the Fredholm index of

an elliptic operator on a closed manifold in terms of topological data. An important special case
are selfadjoint elliptic operators, which naturally appear in geometry and physics but for which,

however, the Fredholm index vanishes. Atiyah, Patodi and Singer introduced in [APS76] the
spectral ﬂow as an integer-valued homotopy invariant for (closed) paths of selfadjoint Fredholm

operators. Roughly speaking, the spectral ﬂow is the number of eigenvalues which pass through
zero in the positive direction from the start of the path to its end. Atiyah, Patodi and Singer

proved in [APS76] that the spectral ﬂow of a closed path of selfadjoint elliptic diﬀerential opera-

tors on a closed manifold can be computed by a topological index in essentially the same way as
the Fredholm index in the previous index theorem [AS68] of Atiyah and Singer. In what follows,
we denote the spectral ﬂow of a path A = {Aλ}λ∈S 1 of selfadjoint Fredholm operators by sf(A).
The spectral ﬂow has been deﬁned in several diﬀerent but equivalent ways and it has become

a well known and widely used integer-valued homotopy invariant for generally non-closed paths
A = {Aλ}λ∈I of selfadjoint Fredholm operators (cf. [Ph96], [BLP05]). For example, lots of ef-
forts have been made to compute the spectral ﬂow for paths A of operators induced by boundary
value problems for ﬁrst order selfadjoint elliptic operators on manifolds with boundary. Several
spectral ﬂow formulas have been found in this setting expressing sf(A) in terms of various in-
[LW96] among many other references). The spectral ﬂow has also been used
variants (cf. e.g.

in symplectic analysis, where, e.g., Floer introduced it as a substitute for the Morse index in
order to deﬁne a grading of his celebrated homology groups [Fl88]. It was thoroughly studied

in this setting by Robbin and Salamon in [RS95], and it was also used before by Salamon and

Zehnder in [SZ92].
The aim of these notes is an essentially self-contained introduction to the spectral ﬂow for paths of

(generally unbounded) selfadjoint Fredholm operators. We begin by recapitulating well known

theory about bounded and unbounded operators in the ﬁrst two sections following [GGK90],
[Go06], [Wei80] and [Ru91], where we particularly focus on spectral theory. The third section is

devoted to the gap-topology on the space of all closed operators on a given Hilbert space, which
we need in order to deal with continuous paths of operators. In the fourth section we construct

the spectral ﬂow and discuss some of its properties following [BLP05], [Le05] and [RS95]. The
ﬁnal section is devoted to a simple example and some hints for further reading.

This manuscript are extended lecture notes of a PhD course that the author gave at the Università
degli studi di Torino in Italy in spring 2013. We are grateful to Anna Capietto and Alessandro

Portaluri for inviting us to give these lectures, and to the audience for several valuable questions.

Linear Operators

1.1 Bounded Operators and Subspaces

Let E and F be non-trivial complex Banach spaces. We denote throughout by IE, IF the identity
operators on E and F , respectively. Recall that a linear operator A : E → F is bounded if there
exists a constant c ≥ 0 such that

The smallest possible bound in (1.1) is the norm kAk of A and it is given by

kAuk ≤ ckuk,

u ∈ E.

kAk = sup
u6=0

kAuk
kuk

= sup

kuk≤1kAuk = sup

kuk=1kAuk.

(1.1)

(1.2)

It is a simple exercise for boring train trips to check the equalities in (1.2) as well as the following

lemmata.

1.1.1 Lemma. The following assertions are equivalent:

• A is continuous,
• A is continuous at some u ∈ E,
• A is continuous at 0 ∈ E,
• A is bounded.

In what follows, we denote by L(E, F ) the set of all bounded operators A : E → F which is a
normed linear space with respect to the operator norm (1.2).

1.1.2 Lemma. L(E, F ) is a Banach space.

CHAPTER 1. LINEAR OPERATORS

The proof of the previous lemma only uses that F is complete and hence the dual space N∗ :=
L(N, C) of any normed linear space N is a Banach space.
The following important result in functional analysis is called the open mapping theorem, and it

is frequently applied to prove the continuity of inverses of operators.

1.1.3 Theorem. If A ∈ L(E, F ) is surjective, then A is an open map, i.e., A(U ) ⊂ F is open
for any open subset U ⊂ E.
In contrast, compact operators are never boundedly invertible on inﬁnite dimensional spaces:

1.1.4 Deﬁnition. A linear operator A : E → F is compact if A(U ) ⊂ F is relatively compact
for any bounded subset U ⊂ E.
We denote by K(E, F ) the set of all compact operators A : E → F .
1.1.5 Lemma. Every compact operator is bounded; i.e., K(E, F ) ⊂ L(E, F ). Moreover, K(E, F )
is closed and products of compact and bounded operators are compact.

Now we assume that U, V are subspaces of E such that E = U ⊕ V algebraically. In this case
we have a unique projection P : E → E onto U with respect to this decomposition and we can
ask about the boundedness of P .

1.1.6 Lemma. The projection P : E → E is bounded if and only if U and V are closed.
A strictly related problem concerns the following deﬁnition.

1.1.7 Deﬁnition. A closed subspace U of a Banach space E is called complemented if there
exists a closed subspace V of E such that E = U ⊕ V .
A well known example of a non-complemented subspace of a Banach space is given by

which is a closed subspace of

{{xn}n∈N ⊂ C :

lim
n→∞

xn = 0}

l∞ = {{xn}n∈N ⊂ C : sup

n∈N|xn| < ∞},

k{xn}n∈Nk = sup

n∈N|xn|.

However, we have the following two positive results.

1.1.8 Theorem. Any closed subspace U of a Hilbert space H is complemented.

Note that the latter result is just the well known theorem on orthogonal projections and decom-
positions H = U ⊕ U⊥ for any closed subspace U ⊂ H.
1.1.9 Lemma. Any subspace U of E of ﬁnite dimension is complemented.

1.1. BOUNDED OPERATORS AND SUBSPACES

Lemma 1.1.9 suggests the question if the same result holds if we require the codimension of U
instead of its dimension to be ﬁnite. That is, we assume to have a decomposition E = U ⊕ V
where V is of ﬁnite dimension. Since ﬁnite dimensional spaces are closed we obtain immediately

that any closed subspace of E of ﬁnite codimension is complemented. However, by the following
result, we cannot omit the closedness assumption.

1.1.10 Lemma. In any Banach space E of inﬁnite dimension, there exists a one-codimensional
subspace U which is not closed.

Proof. Since E is of inﬁnite dimension, there exists an unbounded linear functional f : E → R.
Then U := ker(f ) has codimension 1 and it is not closed. For, assume that U is closed. Since V
is of ﬁnite dimension, we have E = U ⊕ V , where U and V are closed. But f |U≡ 0 and f |V are
continuous and consequently f : E → C would be continuous.

The following remarkable result implies that a ﬁnite codimensional subspace U ⊂ F is comple-
mented if it is the image of a bounded linear operator.

1.1.11 Lemma. If A ∈ L(E, F ) is a bounded linear operator and V ⊂ F is a closed subspace
such that F = im(A) ⊕ V , then im(A) is closed.

Proof. Let P : E → E/ ker(A) denote the projection onto the quotient space. Then A : E → F
factorises as

A

where S : E/ ker(A) → im(A) is the bounded and bijective map deﬁned by S[u] = Au, u ∈ [u] ∈
X/ ker(A). We now deﬁne

S : E/ ker(A) × V → F, S([u], v) = S[u] + w

and note that E/ ker(A) × V is a Banach space as V and ker(A) are closed. Now S is a bijective
bounded linear operator and hence S−1
is bounded by Theorem 1.1.3. As E/ ker(A) × {0} is
closed in E/ ker(A) × V , we obtain that

im(A) = S(E/ ker(A)) = S(E/ ker(A) × {0}) ⊂ F

is closed.

CHAPTER 1. LINEAR OPERATORS

1.2 Closed Operators

As before, we let E and F be non-trivial complex Banach spaces. A linear operator acting
between E and F is a linear map T : D(T ) → F , where D(T ) is a linear subspace of E. We
usually write

in order to emphasise the space E. The operator T is called densely deﬁned if D(T ) is dense in
E and it is called bounded if there exists c > 0 such that

T : D(T ) ⊂ E → F

kT uk ≤ ckuk,

u ∈ D(T ).

Given linear operators T : D(T ) ⊂ E → F , S : D(S) ⊂ E → F R : D(R) ⊂ F → G and α ∈ C,
we deﬁne

• α T : D(α T ) ⊂ E → F by (α T )u = α (T u), u ∈ D(α T ) = D(T ),
• T + S : D(T + S) ⊂ E → F by (T + S)u = T u + Su, u ∈ D(T + S) = D(T ) ∩ D(S),
• RS : D(RS) ⊂ E → G by (RS)u = R(Su),

u ∈ D(RS) = S−1(D(R)) = {u ∈ E : u ∈ D(S), Su ∈ D(R)}.

We write T ⊂ S if D(T ) ⊂ D(S) and T u = Su for all u ∈ D(T ). Moreover, we set T = S if T ⊂ S
and S ⊂ T . Finally, we denote by 0 the operator acting by u 7→ 0 on the domain D(0) = E.
For three operators R, S, T acting between E and F , one easily veriﬁes that

• 0 T ⊂ 0, 0 + T = T + 0 = T ,
• (R + S) + T = R + (S + T ),
• S + T = T + S,
• (S + T ) − T ⊂ S.

Moreover, if T, T1, T2 are operators from E to F , S, S1, S2 map from F to G and R has its range
in E, then

• (ST )R = S(T R),
• (α S)T = S(α T ) = α(ST ) if α 6= 0,
• (0 S)T = 0(ST ) ⊂ T (0 S),
• (S1 + S2)T = S1T + S2T ,
• S(T1 + T2) ⊃ ST1 + ST2,

1.2. CLOSED OPERATORS

• IF T = T IE = T .

1.2.1 Deﬁnition. We call an operator T : D(T ) ⊂ E → F invertible, if T maps D(T ) bijectively
onto F . We say that T has a bounded inverse, if T is invertible and T −1 : F → D(T ) ⊂ E is
bounded.

Let us point out that there are various non-equivalent deﬁnitions of invertibility in the literature.
For example, in [Ka76] an operator is called invertible if it is injective. On the contrary, in [HS96]

an operator is said to be invertible if it has a bounded inverse according to Deﬁnition 1.2.1.
For an operator T : D(T ) ⊂ E → F , we denote by

graph(T ) = {(u, T u) ∈ E × F : u ∈ D(T )} ⊂ E × F

the graph of T , which is a linear subspace of the Banach space E×F . Clearly, T ⊂ S is equivalent
to graph(T ) ⊂ graph(S).
1.2.2 Deﬁnition. The operator T : D(T ) ⊂ E → F is called closed if graph(T ) is a closed
subspace of E × F .
Note that T is closed if and only if, for every sequence {un}n∈N ⊂ D(T ) such that (un, T un) →
(u, v) ∈ E × F for some u ∈ E and v ∈ F we have u ∈ D(T ) and T u = v.
1.2.3 Example. We consider the operator

T : C1[0, 1] ⊂ C[0, 1] → C[0, 1],

T u = u′,

which is not bounded as kT unk∞ = n = nkunk∞ for un(t) = tn, n ∈ N. We claim that T is
closed. Let {un}n∈N ⊂ C1[0, 1] be a sequence and v ∈ C[0, 1] such that un → u and T un = u′n → v
uniformly. Then

Z t

v(s) ds = Z t

n→0

u′n(s) ds = lim

u′n(s) ds = u(t) − u(0), t ∈ [0, 1],

and hence

u(t) = u(0) +Z t

0

v(s) ds,

t ∈ [0, 1],

where v ∈ C[0, 1]. Consequently, u ∈ C1[0, 1], T u = v and so T is closed.
In what follows we denote the set of all closed operators acting between E and F by C(E, F ). In
contrast to L(E, F ), the set C(E, F ) is not a linear space:
1.2.4 Example. Assume that D ⊂ E is dense and strictly contained in E and let T : D(T ) ⊂
E → F be a closed operator deﬁned on D(T ) = D (e.g., E = C[0, 1], T u = u′ on D(T ) = C1[0, 1]
as in Example 1.2.3). Then T − T = 0 T ⊂ 0 is not closed because

is not a closed subspace of E × F .

graph(T − T ) = graph(0 T ) = D × {0}

12

CHAPTER 1. LINEAR OPERATORS

1.2.5 Lemma. A bounded operator T is closed if and only if D(T ) is closed in E.
Proof. Assume that T is bounded and closed, and let {un}n∈N ⊂ D(T ) be a sequence such that
un → u in E. Since T is bounded, {T un}n∈N is a Cauchy sequence in F and hence converges
to some v ∈ F . Consequently, (un, T un) → (u, v), n → ∞, and as T is closed, we conclude that
u ∈ D(T ) (and v = T u).
Conversely, assume that T is bounded and D(T ) is closed. If {un}n∈N is a sequence converging
to some u ∈ E, then u ∈ D(T ). As T is bounded, we obtain that T un → T u and hence T is
closed.

We obtain as a consequence of the previous lemma that L(E, F ) ⊂ C(E, F ).
1.2.6 Lemma. Let T ∈ C(E, F ) be a closed operator.

(i) α T is closed for any 0 6= α ∈ C.
(ii) If B : D(B) ⊂ E → F is bounded and D(T ) ⊂ D(B), then T + B ∈ C(E, F ).
(iii) If T is invertible, then T −1 ∈ C(F, E).
Proof. For the ﬁrst assertion we just note that the map

E × F → E × F,

(u, v) 7→ (u, α v)

is a homeomorphism mapping graph(T ) to graph(α T ). In order to show the second assertion
let {un}n∈N be a sequence in D(T + B) = D(T ) such that un → u ∈ E and assume that
(T + B)un = T un + Bun → v, n → ∞. As B is bounded, D(B) is closed by Lemma 1.2.5 and
Bun → Bu. We obtain T un → v−Bu. Since T is closed, this implies u ∈ D(T ) and T u = v−Bu.
Consequently, u ∈ D(T + B) and v = (T + B)u. For the last assertion, we only have to observe
that

{(T −1u, u) ∈ E × F : u ∈ F} = {(u, T u) ∈ E × F : u ∈ D(T )} = graph(T )

and that the left hand side is mapped to graph(T −1) under the homeomorphism E× F → F × E,
(u, v) 7→ (v, u).
1.2.7 Example. Let us consider the operator T : D(T ) ⊂ C[0, 1] → C[0, 1], T u = u′, where
D(T ) = {u ∈ C1[0, 1] : u(0) = 0}. Then T has a bounded inverse given by

T −1 : C[0, 1] → C[0, 1],

(T −1u)(t) = Z t

0

u(s) ds

and hence T is closed by Lemma 1.2.6 and Lemma 1.2.5.

Let T : D(T ) ⊂ E → F and S : D(S) ⊂ E → F be two linear operators such that D(T ) ⊂ D(S).
Then S is said to be T -bounded if there exists a, b ≥ 0 such that

kSuk ≤ akuk + bkT uk, u ∈ D(T ).

(1.3)

1.2. CLOSED OPERATORS

13

The inﬁmum of all b ≥ 0 for which an a ≥ 0 exists such that (1.3) holds is called the T -bound of
S. Note that the T -bound is 0 if S is bounded. The second part of the previous lemma can be

improved as follows.

1.2.8 Theorem. Let T : D(T ) ⊂ E → F and S : D(S) ⊂ E → F be two linear operators such
that S is T -bounded with T -bound less than 1. Then T + S is closed if and only if T is closed.

Proof. [Wei80, Theorem 5.5]

1.2.9 Lemma. If T ∈ C(E, F ), then ker(T ) ⊂ E is closed.
Proof. This follows from

ker(T ) × {0} = graph(T ) ∩ (E × {0}),

as graph(T ) and E × {0} are closed.
The following important result is usually called the closed graph theorem.

1.2.10 Theorem. If T ∈ C(E, F ) and D(T ) = E, then T ∈ L(E, F ).
Proof. By assumption, graph(T ) ⊂ E × F is closed and hence a Banach space in its own right.
We deﬁne an operator

S : E → graph(T ), Su = (u, T u)

and note that S is bijective and its inverse is the restriction P1 |graph(T ): graph(T ) → E, where
P1 denotes the projection onto the ﬁrst component in E × F . As P1 |graph(T ) is bounded and
surjective, it is an open map by the open mapping theorem (Theorem 1.1.3). Accordingly,

(P1 |graph(T ))−1 = S

is bounded. To show the assertion, we just have to observe that T = P2 ◦ S, where P2 denotes
the projection on the second component in E × F .
Note that Theorem 1.2.10 implies that D(T ) 6= E if T ∈ C(E, F ) is unbounded. Moreover, if
T ∈ C(E, F ) is invertible, then T −1 ∈ C(F, E) by Lemma 1.2.6 and D(T −1) = F . Accordingly,
T −1 ∈ L(F, E), and so a closed operator is invertible if and only if it has a bounded inverse.
1.2.11 Lemma. If B ∈ L(E, F ) and T ∈ C(F, G) are such that im(B) ⊂ D(T ), then T B ∈
L(E, G).
Proof. By Theorem 1.2.10 we only need to show that T B is closed since D(T B) = E by assump-
tion. Let {un}n∈N be a sequence in E such that un → u ∈ E and assume that (T B)un → v,
n → ∞. As B is bounded, we obtain Bun → Bu. Moreover, since T is closed, we get that
Bu ∈ D(T ) and (T B)(un) → T (Bu). Hence v = T Bu and so T B is closed.

14

CHAPTER 1. LINEAR OPERATORS

Now let T : D(T ) ⊂ E → F be a linear operator. The graph norm on D(T ) is deﬁned by

kukT = (kuk2 + kT uk2)

1

2 ,

u ∈ D(T ).

Note that T : D(T ) → F is bounded when considered as an operator on the normed linear space
D(T ) with respect to the graph norm. The normed linear space D(T ) with respect to k · kT is
isometric to the linear subspace graph(T ) of E × F . Hence we immediately obtain the following
result.

1.2.12 Lemma. T ∈ C(E, F ) if and only if D(T ) is a Banach space with respect to the graph
norm.

The following result shows that the Banach space structures are essentially determined by the
underlying domains of the operators.

1.2.13 Lemma. If T1, T2 ∈ C(E, F ) have the same domain D = D(T1) = D(T2), then the graph
norms of T1 and T2 on D are equivalent.

Proof. We denote by DT1 and DT2 the space D with the graph norm of T1 and T2, respectively.
Let us consider T1 : DT2 → F and let {(un, T1un)}n∈N ⊂ graph(T1 : DT2 → F ) be any sequence
which converges in DT2 × F to an element (u, v) ∈ DT2 × F . Since un → u in DT2 implies that
un converges also to u with respect to the norm of E, we get from the closedness of T1 that
(un, T1un) → (u, T1u) in E × F . Hence (un, T1un) → (u, T1u) in DT2 × F which implies that
T1 : DT2 → F is closed. As DT2 is complete, we obtain from Theorem 1.2.10 that T1 : DT2 → F
is bounded. Accordingly, there exists a constant c > 0 such that

and thus

kT1ukF ≤ c(kukE + kT2ukF )

By using elementary inequalities, we ﬁnally obtain

kukE + kT1ukF ≤ (c + 1)(kukE + kT2ukF ).

The assertion follows by swapping T1 and T2.

We now consider special classes of closed Operators.

1.2.14 Deﬁnition. An operator T ∈ C(E, F ) is called Fredholm if ker(T ) is of ﬁnite dimension
and im(T ) of ﬁnite codimension. The Fredholm index of a Fredholm operator is deﬁned as

ind(T ) = dim ker(T ) − codim im(T ).

1.3. SPECTRAL THEORY

15

Note that T is assumed to be a closed operator. The following result is often required as an
additional assumption in the deﬁnition of a Fredholm operator.

1.2.15 Lemma. If T ∈ C(E, F ) is Fredholm, then im(T ) ⊂ F is closed.
Proof. If we consider T on its domain D(T ) with respect to the graph norm, then T is bounded.
As a change of the norm in the domain does not aﬀect im(T ), the assertion follows from Lemma
1.1.11.

1.2.16 Example. Let us consider once again the operator T : C1[0, 1] ⊂ C[0, 1] → C[0, 1]
given by T u = u′. We have already seen in Example 1.2.3 that T is closed. The kernel of T is
the one-dimensional subspace of C[0, 1] consisting of the constant functions. Given v ∈ C[0, 1],
then u(t) = R s
0 v(s) ds, t ∈ [0, 1], deﬁnes an element in C1[0, 1] such that T u = v. Hence T is

surjective and we conclude that T is a Fredholm operator of index 1.

Finally, we mention without proof the following two results on the stability of Fredholmness.

1.2.17 Theorem. Let T ∈ C(E, F ) be Fredholm. Then there exists γ > 0 such that for every
S : D(S) ⊂ E → F such that D(T ) ⊂ D(S) and

kSuk ≤ γ(kuk + kT uk),

u ∈ D(T ),

the operator T + S is Fredholm and

(i) dim ker(T + S) ≤ dim ker(T ),
(ii) codim im(T + S) ≤ codim im(T ),
(iii) ind(T + S) = ind(T ).

Proof. [GGK90, Theorem XVII.4.2]

1.2.18 Theorem. Let T ∈ C(E, F ) be Fredholm and S : D(S) ⊂ E → F such that D(T ) ⊂ D(S)
and S |D(T ): D(T ) → F is compact with respect to the graph norm of T on D(T ). Then T + S
is Fredholm and

ind(T + S) = ind(T ).

Proof. [GGK90, Theorem XVII.4.3]

1.3 Spectral Theory

Let T : D(T ) ⊂ E → E be a linear operator. We call λ ∈ C an eigenvalue of T if there exists
u ∈ D(T ), u 6= 0, such that T u = λu. If λ is not an eigenvalue, then λ − T is injective and hence
the resolvent operator

16

CHAPTER 1. LINEAR OPERATORS

R(λ, T ) = (λ − T )−1, D(R(λ, T )) = im(T ) ⊂ E,

is well deﬁned. We deﬁne the resolvent set of T by

ρ(T ) = {λ ∈ C : λ − T bijective, R(λ, T ) ∈ L(E)}.

A ﬁrst important observation reads as follows:

1.3.1 Lemma. If T /∈ C(E), then ρ(T ) = ∅.
Proof. If λ ∈ ρ(T ) 6= ∅, then R(λ, T ) = (λ − T )−1 is bounded and hence closed by Lemma 1.2.5.
Then λ − T is closed by Lemma 1.2.6 and so T is closed as well.

Accordingly, we assume in what follows that T ∈ C(E). Note that in this case we obtain from
Theorem 1.2.10 that

ρ(T ) = {λ ∈ C : λ − T is bijective}.

We deﬁne the spectrum σ(T ) of T to be C \ ρ(T ) and the point spectrum σp(T ) ⊂ σ(T ) as the
set of all eigenvalues of T .

1.3.2 Lemma. The resolvent set ρ(T ) ⊂ C is open and, accordingly, σ(T ) ⊂ C is closed.
Moreover, if λ0 ∈ ρ(T ) 6= ∅ and |λ − λ0| < kR(λ0, T )k−1, then λ ∈ ρ(T ) and

R(λ, T ) =

∞Xk=0

(λ − λ0)kR(λ0, T )k+1,

where the series converges in the norm of L(E). In particular, R(·, T ) is analytic on ρ(T ).
Proof. We assume that ρ(T ) 6= ∅ and take some λ0 ∈ ρ(T ). If |λ − λ0| < kR(λ0, T )k−1 then the
series

S(λ) :=

∞Xk=0

(λ − λ0)kR(λ0, T )k+1

converges absolutely and we claim that S(λ) = R(λ, T ) = (T − λ)−1. If u ∈ D(T ), then

R(λ0, T )(T − λ)u = (T − λ0)−1(T − λ0 − (λ − λ0))u = u − (λ − λ0)R(λ0, T )u

(1.4)

and we obtain

S(λ)(T − λ)u =

(λ − λ0)kR(λ0, T )ku −

∞Xk=0

(λ − λ0)k+1R(λ0, T )k+1u = u.

Consequently, S(λ)(T − λ) = ID(T ). Now let v ∈ E be given. We deﬁne

un :=

n

Xk=0

(λ − λ0)kR(λ0)k+1v, n ∈ N,

which is a sequence in D(T ) converging to u := S(λ)v ∈ E. By using a computation as in (1.4),
we obtain

(T − λ)un =

n

and so we see from our assumption on λ that (T − λ)un → v ∈ E, n → ∞. As T − λ is closed,
we conclude that u ∈ D(T ) and (T − λ)S(λ)v = (T − λ)u = v. Consequently, (T − λ)S(λ) = IE
and we ﬁnally obtain that S(λ) = (T − λ)−1 = R(λ, T ).
Let us point out that in contrast to operators in L(E), the spectrum of elements in C(E) can be
unbounded and even empty:

1.3.3 Example. We consider again the closed operators

T : D(T ) ⊂ C[0, 1] → C[0, 1],

T0 : D(T0) ⊂ C[0, 1] → C[0, 1],

where

D(T ) = C1[0, 1],

D(T0) = {u ∈ C1[0, 1] : u(0) = 0}

and both operators map elements u to their ﬁrst derivative.
For the operator T , we see that eλ t ∈ ker(λ − T ) for all λ ∈ C and hence σ(T ) = C. For
T0 it is readily seen that ker(λ − T0) = {0} for all λ ∈ C. Moreover, if g ∈ C[0, 1], then
u(t) = −eλtR t

0 e−λs g(s) ds, t ∈ [0, 1], is a solution of the equation (λ − T0)u = g and so

18

CHAPTER 1. LINEAR OPERATORS

k(λ − T0)−1gk = kuk ≤ e|λ|kgk.

Hence σ(T0) = ∅.
There are various deﬁnitions of subsets of σ(T ) other than σp(T ). Here we just want to introduce
the essential spectrum σess(T ) which consists of all λ ∈ C such that λ − T is not a Fredholm
operator. In contrast to the case of bounded operators, it is possible that σess(T ) = ∅. Note
that in general we neither have σ(T ) = σp(T ) ∪ σess(T ) nor σp(T ) ∩ σess(T ) = ∅.
As next step we introduce Riesz projections. Let T ∈ C(E) and assume that we have a disjoint
union σ(T ) = σ ∪ τ , where σ is contained in a bounded Cauchy domain1 ∆ such that τ ∩ ∆ = ∅.
Let Γ denote the oriented boundary of ∆. For N ∈ N suﬃciently large we approximate Γ by a
union of straight-line segments ∆i, i = 1, . . . N , such that SN
i=1 ∆i is a closed polygonal contour
containing σ. We choose λi ∈ ∆i, i = 1, . . . , N and set

P N

σ =

In this way we can construct a sequence

Given an operator T acting on a linear space E, a subspace M ⊂ E is called T -invariant if
T (M ∩D(T )) ⊂ M . In this case T |M denotes the operator T with domain M ∩D(T ) and range
in M .

1.3.4 Theorem. Let T ∈ C(E) with spectrum σ(T ) = σ ∪ τ , where σ is contained in a bounded
Cauchy domain △ such that △ ∩ τ = ∅. Let Γ be the oriented boundary of △. Then

(iii) the subspaces M = im(Pσ) and N = ker(Pσ) are T -invariant,

(iv) the subspace M is contained in D(T ) and T |M is bounded,
(v) σ(T |M ) = σ and σ(T |N ) = τ .
1The deﬁnition of Cauchy domain can be found in [GGK90, Sec. I.1]. For example, any open and connected

subset of C whose boundary is a closed rectiﬁable Jordan curve is a Cauchy domain.

1.3. SPECTRAL THEORY

19

Proof. [GGK90, Theorem XV.2.1]

Pσ is called the Riesz projection of the operator T with respect to σ.
We call a point λ ∈ σ(T ) an eigenvalue of ﬁnite type if λ is isolated in σ(T ) and the associated
projection P{λ} has ﬁnite rank. Since by Theorem 1.3.4, {λ} = σ(T |im(P{λ})) and im(P{λ}) is
ﬁnite dimensional, it follows that λ ∈ σp(T ). Moreover, note that im(P{λ}) ⊃ ker(λ − T ) but
equality does not hold in general. However, we will see in the next chapter that im(P{λ}) =
ker(λ − T ) if T is selfadjoint.
A quite often appearing situation is considered in the following theorem.

1.3.5 Theorem. Let T ∈ C(E) be such that R(λ0, T ) = (λ0 − T )−1 is compact for some λ0 ∈
ρ(T ). Then R(λ, T ) is compact for any λ ∈ ρ(T ), σ(T ) does not have a limit point in C and
every point in σ(T ) is an eigenvalue of ﬁnite type. Moreover, for any λ ∈ C we have

dim ker(λ − T ) = codim im(λ − T ) < ∞

so that each operator λ − T is Fredholm of index 0.
Proof. [GGK90, Theorem XV.2.3]

We call T ∈ C(E) an operator with compact resolvent if there exists λ0 ∈ C such that R(λ0, T )
is compact. Note that σess(T ) = ∅ in this case.
1.3.6 Lemma. If T ∈ C(E) has a compact resolvent and B ∈ L(E) is bounded, then T + B is a
Fredholm operator of index 0.

Proof. We ﬁx λ ∈ ρ(T ) and obtain a compact operator (λ − T )−1 : E → E. Then B(λ − T )−1 :
E → E is compact as well since the composition of a bounded and a compact operator is still
compact. Consequently,

B = (B(λ − T )−1)(λ − T ) : D(T ) → E

is compact with respect to the graph norm of T on D(T ). Now the assertion follows from Theorem
1.2.18 and Theorem 1.3.5.

Chapter 2

Selfadjoint Operators

2.1 Deﬁnitions and Basic Properties

Let H be a complex non-trivial Hilbert space. The following result is known as the Riesz

representation theorem.

2.1.1 Theorem. Let f : H → C be a continuous linear functional. Then there exists a unique
v ∈ H such that

f (u) = hu, vi,

u ∈ H.

Let T : D(T ) ⊂ H → H be a densely deﬁned operator acting on H. We deﬁne

D(T ∗) = {v ∈ H : u 7→ hT u, viH is bounded onD(T )},

and note that, as D(T ) is assumed to be dense in H, each functional u 7→ hT u, viH , v ∈ D(T ∗),
has a continuous extension on all of H. Hence, by the Riesz Representation Theorem, we can
associate to any v ∈ D(T ∗) an element T ∗v ∈ H such that

hT u, viH = hu, T ∗viH ,

u ∈ D(T ), v ∈ D(T ∗).

The resulting operator T ∗ on H with domain D(T ∗) is linear and it is called the adjoint of T .
We make at ﬁrst a rather simple observation, which is however often used when dealing with

adjoints of operators.

2.1.2 Lemma. Assume that T : D(T ) ⊂ H → H is densely deﬁned and S : D(S) ⊂ H → H is
any linear operator. If

hT u, vi = hu, Svi,

u ∈ D(T ), v ∈ D(S),

(2.1)

then S ⊂ T ∗.

21

22

CHAPTER 2. SELFADJOINT OPERATORS

Proof. We obtain from (2.1) and the deﬁnition of the adjoint that D(S) ⊂ D(T ∗). Hence we
conclude from (2.1) that hu, T ∗vi = hu, Svi for all u ∈ D(T ) and v ∈ D(S). This implies that
Sv = T ∗v, as D(T ) is dense by assumption.
2.1.3 Lemma. If T is densely deﬁned, then T ∗ ∈ C(H).
Proof. Let us assume that {un}n∈N ⊂ D(T ∗) is such that un → u and T ∗un → v, n → ∞,
for some u, v ∈ H. We obtain for all w ∈ D(T ) that hw, T ∗uni = hT w, uni → hT w, ui and
hw, T ∗uni → hw, vi. Hence hw, vi = hT w, ui for all w ∈ D(T ) which shows that u ∈ D(T ∗) by
the deﬁnition of T ∗. Moreover, we obtain hw, vi = hw, T ∗ui for all w ∈ D(T ) and conclude that
v = T ∗u. This shows that T ∗ is closed.

Let us point out that it is possible that D(T ∗) = {0} for a densely deﬁned operator T (cf.[GGK90,
p.291]). However, since we are solely interested in closed operators, such singular phenomena

cannot occur:

2.1.4 Lemma. If T ∈ C(H) is densely deﬁned, then T ∗ is densely deﬁned as well and T ∗∗ = T .
Proof. [Wei80, Theorem 5.3]

A densely deﬁned operator T acting on a Hilbert space H is called symmetric if T ⊂ T ∗ and
selfadjoint if T = T ∗. Note that a selfadjoint operator is closed by Lemma 2.1.3.

2.1.5 Lemma. Let T be a densely deﬁned operator acting on H.

(i) T is symmetric if and only if T ⊂ T ∗∗ ⊂ T ∗ = T ∗∗∗. In this case T ∗∗ is symmetric as well.
(ii) T ∈ C(H) is symmetric if and only if T = T ∗∗ ⊂ T ∗.
(iii) T is selfadjoint if and only if T = T ∗∗ = T ∗.

Proof. [We05, VII.2.5]

The next result is the Hellinger-Toeplitz theorem:

2.1.6 Theorem. If T is symmetric and D(T ) = H, then T is selfadjoint and T ∈ L(H).
Proof. Since T ⊂ T ∗ and D(T ) = H, it is clear that T is selfadjoint. In particular, T is closed
by Lemma 2.1.3 and hence bounded by the closed graph theorem (Theorem 1.2.10).

The following lemma holds analogously to the bounded case:

2.1.7 Lemma. Let T : D(T ) ⊂ H → H be densely deﬁned. Then

(i) (im T )⊥ = ker(T ∗),

(ii) im T = (ker T ∗)⊥.

2.1. DEFINITIONS AND BASIC PROPERTIES

23

Proof. Since (U⊥)⊥ = U for all U ⊂ H, the second assertion follows from the ﬁrst one. In order
to show (i) let us assume at ﬁrst that u ∈ (im T )⊥. Then hT v, ui = 0 for all v ∈ D(T ) and we
conclude that u ∈ D(T ∗) and T ∗u = 0. Consequently, u ∈ ker(T ∗). If, conversely, v ∈ ker(T ∗),
then hu, T ∗vi = 0 for all u ∈ H. Hence hT u, vi = 0 for all u ∈ D(T ) and so v ∈ (im T )⊥.
2.1.8 Lemma. If T ∈ C(H) is densely deﬁned and invertible, then T ∗ is invertible as well and
(T ∗)−1 = (T −1)∗.

Proof. As T −1 : H → H, the domain of the adjoint (T −1)∗ is H and we obtain for all v ∈ H
and u ∈ D(T )

Hence

hT u, (T −1)∗vi = hT −1T u, vi = hu, vi.

(T −1)∗v ∈ D(T ∗),

T ∗(T −1)∗v = v,

v ∈ H,

(2.2)

and we note that T ∗ is surjective. As T is invertible, T ∗ is injective as well by Lemma 2.1.7, and
so T ∗ has a bounded inverse by the closed graph theorem. Finally, from (2.2) we deduce that
(T ∗)−1 = (T −1)∗.

2.1.9 Lemma. Let T, S ∈ C(H) be densely deﬁned. If ST is densely deﬁned, then

Moreover, if S ∈ L(H) then

T ∗S∗ ⊂ (ST )∗.

(ST )∗ = T ∗S∗.

Proof. If u ∈ D(ST ) and v ∈ D(T ∗S∗), then

and

hT u, S∗vi = hu, T ∗S∗vi

hST u, vi = hT u, S∗vi.

Consequently, hST u, vi = hu, T ∗S∗vi and the ﬁrst assertion is shown.
Now assume that S ∈ L(H) and v ∈ D((ST )∗). As S∗ ∈ L(H), we have D(S∗) = H and so we
obtain for all u ∈ D(ST )

hT u, S∗vi = hST u, vi = hu, (ST )∗vi.

We conclude that S∗v ∈ D(T ∗) and so v ∈ D(T ∗S∗). Consequently, (ST )∗ = T ∗S∗ by the ﬁrst
assertion of the lemma.

24

CHAPTER 2. SELFADJOINT OPERATORS

The following example can be found, e.g., in [Ru91].

2.1.10 Example. We consider H = L2[0, 1] and deﬁne

D(T1) = H 1[0, 1] = {u : [0, 1] → C : u absolutely continuous, u′ ∈ L2[0, 1]},

as well as

D(T2) = {u ∈ D(T1) : u(0) = u(1)}
D(T3) = {u ∈ D(T1) : u(0) = u(1) = 0}.

If we set Tku = i u′ for k = 1, 2, 3, then

T ∗1 = T3,

T ∗2 = T2,

T ∗3 = T1.

(2.3)

As T3 ⊂ T2 ⊂ T1 we note in particular that T3 is symmetric and T2 is selfadjoint.
In order to show (2.3) we compute for u ∈ D(Tk), v ∈ D(Tm), m + k = 4,

hTku, vi = Z 1

If now k = 1 or k = 2, then Y := {u ∈ L2[0, 1] : u ≡ const.} ⊂ D(Tk) and we see from (2.4) that

If k = 3, we have u(1) = 0 for all u ∈ D(T3) and we conclude that in all cases

w(1) = 0,

k = 1, 2.

iv − w ∈ (im Tk)⊥,

k = 1, 2, 3.

(2.5)

(2.6)

Now let us consider at ﬁrst T1. As T1 is surjective, we obtain from (2.6) that iv = w. By (2.5),
this implies that v(0) = v(1) = 0 and hence v ∈ D(T3) which shows that T ∗1 ⊂ T3.

2.1. DEFINITIONS AND BASIC PROPERTIES

25

For k = 2 and k = 3, we note at ﬁrst that im(Tk) = Y ⊥ and so we obtain from (2.6) that iv − w
is a constant function. By the deﬁnition of w, we conclude that v is absolutely continuous and
v′ = T ∗k v ∈ L2[0, 1]. Hence v ∈ D(T1), and for k = 3 we see that T ∗3 ⊂ T1. For k = 2 we have in
addition w(1) = 0 by (2.5) which shows v(0) = v(1). Hence v ∈ D(T2) and T ∗2 ⊂ T2.
2.1.11 Lemma. If T : D(T ) ⊂ H → H is symmetric and surjective, then T is selfadjoint.
Proof. As T is symmetric, we only need to show that D(T ∗) ⊂ D(T ). Let v ∈ D(T ∗). Since T
is surjective, there exists u ∈ D(T ) such that T u = T ∗v. So for every w ∈ D(T )

hT w, vi = hw, T ∗vi = hw, T ui = hT w, ui,

and consequently v = u ∈ D(T ), where we use again the surjectivity of T .
2.1.12 Example. We revisit the diﬀerential operator T2 on L2[0, 1] from Example 2.1.10, where
we modify the domain slightly. We consider for λ ∈ [−π, π] the operator Tλu = i u′ on

D(Tλ) = {u ∈ H 1[0, 1] : u(0) = eiλu(1)}.

Note that Tλ = T2 for λ = 0, so that in this case Tλ is selfadjoint by Example 2.1.10. If, however,
λ 6= 0 and v ∈ L2[0, 1], then a straightforward computation shows that

u(t) = −iZ t

v(s) ds −

v(s) ds,

hTλu, vi = Z 1

uv′ dt = hu, Tλvi,

(iu′)v dt = ieiλu(0)eiλv(0) − iu(0)v(0)

and so Tλ is symmetric. Consequently, by Lemma 2.1.11, Tλ is selfadjoint for all λ ∈ [−π, π].
Note that the sum of two selfadjoint operators is in general not selfadjoint. The Kato-Rellich

theorem is a classical result giving conditions on how much a selfadjoint operator can be perturbed
without losing its selfadjointness. Here we just prove a much weaker assertion which, however,

is often suﬃcient for applications and is a rather direct consequence of the deﬁnitions.

2.1.13 Theorem. Let T : D(T ) ⊂ H → H be selfadjoint and let S : H → H be symmetric.
Then T + S is selfadjoint on D(T ).
Proof. Let v ∈ D(T + S) = D(T ) = D(T ∗). Then

h(T + S)u, vi = hT u, vi + hSu, vi = hu, T vi + hu, Svi = hu, (T + S)vi

26

CHAPTER 2. SELFADJOINT OPERATORS

and the functional u 7→ h(T + S)u, vi is bounded on D(T + S) = D(T ). Hence v ∈ D((T + S)∗)
and we have shown that T + S ⊂ (T + S)∗.
Now we assume that v ∈ D((T + S)∗). Then the functional

u 7→ h(T + S)u, vi = hT u, vi + hSu, vi,

u ∈ D(T + S) = D(T ),

If we now assume that u 7→ hT u, vi is unbounded on D(T ), then there exists a
is bounded.
sequence {un}n∈N ⊂ D(T ), kunk = 1, n ∈ N, such that hT un, vi → ∞, n → ∞. As |hSun, vi| ≤
kSkkvk, we would obtain that h(T + S)un, vi → ∞ which is a contradiction. Hence u 7→ hT u, vi
is bounded on D(T ) and so v ∈ D(T ∗) = D(T ) = D(T + S). Consequently, (T + S)∗ = T + S.

2.2 Spectral Theory of Selfadjoint Operators

2.2.1 Lemma. Let E be a Banach space. If T ∈ C(E) and there exists β ≥ 0 such that

kT uk ≥ βkuk,

u ∈ D(T ),

(2.7)

then im(T ) is closed.

Proof. Let {T un}n∈N be a sequence in im(T ) such that T un → v ∈ E. We obtain from (2.7)
that {un}n∈N is a Cauchy sequence in E and so un → u for some u ∈ E. As T is closed, we
conclude that u ∈ D(T ) and v = T u ∈ im(T ). Consequently, im(T ) is closed.
2.2.2 Lemma. If T : D(T ) ⊂ H → H is selfadjoint, then σ(T ) ⊂ R and

k(λ − T )−1k ≤ |β|−1,

λ = α + i β, α, β ∈ R, β 6= 0.

(2.8)

Proof. Assume that λ = α + i β, α, β ∈ R and β 6= 0. We obtain for u ∈ D(T )

h(α + iβ)u − T u, (α + iβ)u − T ui = h(αu − T u) + iβu, (αu − T u) + iβui

= kαu − T uk2 + β2kuk2 − iβh(α − T )u, ui + iβhu, (α − T )ui

and conclude that

k(λ − T )uk2 ≥ β2kuk2,

u ∈ D(T ),

(2.9)

where we use that T is symmetric. Hence im(λ− T ) is closed by Lemma 2.2.1. As ker(λ− T ) = 0
by (2.9), we obtain from Lemma 2.1.7

2.2. SPECTRAL THEORY OF SELFADJOINT OPERATORS

27

H = im(λ − T ) ⊕ ker(λ − T ) = im(λ − T )

and so λ ∈ ρ(T ). Finally, (2.8) follows from (2.9).
The ﬁrst part of the previous lemma can be improved as follows:

2.2.3 Lemma. Let T ∈ C(H) be densely deﬁned and symmetric. Then precisely one of the
following assertions hold:

(i) σ(T ) = C;

(ii) σ(T ) = {α + iβ ∈ C : β ≥ 0};
(iii) σ(T ) = {α + iβ ∈ C : β ≤ 0};
(iv) σ(T ) ⊂ R.
Moreover, σ(T ) ⊂ R if and only if T is selfadjoint.
Proof. [Ka76, Sec. V.3.4]

Note that in particular a closed symmetric operator is selfadjoint if ρ(T ) ∩ R 6= ∅.
2.2.4 Lemma. If T ∈ C(H) is densely deﬁned and selfadjoint, then

σ(T ) = σp(T ) ∪ σess(T ).

Proof. Since σ(T ) ⊂ R, any λ− T , λ ∈ σ(T ), is selfadjoint as well. Hence we can assume without
loss of generality that 0 ∈ σ(T ) and it suﬃces to consider the case λ = 0.
As ker(T ) = (im T )⊥ by Lemma 2.1.7, we see that either T is not injective or its image is dense
in H. If T is not injective, then 0 ∈ σp(T ). If on the other hand T is injective, then T has a
dense image but im(T ) 6= H as otherwise 0 ∈ ρ(T ). Hence im(T ) is not closed and so T is not a
Fredholm operator which implies that 0 ∈ σess(T ).
Finally, we consider selfadjoint Fredholm operators.

2.2.5 Lemma. Let T ∈ C(H) be selfadjoint and Fredholm. Then 0 is either in the resolvent set
ρ(T ) or it is an isolated eigenvalue of ﬁnite multiplicity.

Proof. As T is Fredholm, we get from Lemma 1.2.17 that there is ε > 0 such that λ − T is also
Fredholm for all λ ∈ (−ε, ε). Consequently, (−ε, ε) ∩ σess(T ) = ∅ and by Lemma 2.2.4 we only
need to show that 0 is isolated in σ(T ) if it is not in the resolvent set.
We set X := (ker T )⊥ = im(T ) which is a Hilbert space as it is a closed subspace of H. We claim
that

28

CHAPTER 2. SELFADJOINT OPERATORS

T ′ := T |X : D(T ′) = X ∩ D(T ) ⊂ X → X

is closed. Indeed, if {un}n∈N ⊂ D(T ′) is a sequence such that un → u and T ′un → v for some
u, v ∈ X, then we obtain for all w ∈ D(T )

hT ′un, wi = hun, T wi → hu, T wi.

Since hT ′un, wi → hv, wi, we get that hu, T wi = hv, wi for all w ∈ D(T ) and so u ∈ D(T ∗) =
D(T ). As un ∈ (ker T )⊥ for all n ∈ N, we also have that u ∈ (ker T )⊥ and so u ∈ D(T ′).
Moreover, we obtain

hv, wi = hT ∗u, wi = hT u, wi = hT ′u, wi, w ∈ D(T ),

which shows that T ′u = v, and so T ′ is closed.
Since T ′ is moreover bijective, we obtain from the closed graph theorem that (T ′)−1 : X → X
is bounded and hence 0 ∈ ρ(T ′). Accordingly, there exists a neighbourhood of 0 in C belonging
entirely to the resolvent set of T ′.
Now let us assume that there is some λ ∈ (−ε, ε) \ {0} such that λ ∈ ρ(T ′) and that there exists
u = u1 + u2 ∈ D(T ) = (ker(T )⊕ im(T ))∩D(T ) such that λu− T u = λu1 + λu2 − T u2 = 0. Then
λu1 = (T − λ)u2 = (T ′ − λ)u2 and since the right hand side is in im(T ) and the left hand side
in ker(T ), we see that both sides vanish. As 0 6= λ ∈ ρ(T ′), we get that u1 = u2 = 0 and hence
u = 0 which shows that λ ∈ ρ(T ).
Finally, let us note the following result on spectral projections for later reference.

2.2.6 Lemma. Let T ∈ C(H) be selfadjoint and let λ0 be an isolated point in the spectrum σ(T ).
Then λ0 ∈ σp(T ) and

Proof. [HS96, Prop. 6.3]

im(P{λ0}) = ker(λ0 − T ).

The Gap Topology

3.1 Deﬁnition and Properties

As before we let H 6= {0} be a complex Hilbert space. We denote by C sa(H) the set of all densely
deﬁned, selfadjoint operators T : D(T ) ⊂ H → H and the aim of this section is to introduce a
metric on the space C sa(H).
If T ∈ C sa(H), then ±i /∈ σ(T ) and we obtain in particular that T + i has a bounded inverse
(T + i)−1 : H → H. As T − i ∈ C(H) and im((T + i)−1) = D(T ) = D(T − i), we conclude by
Lemma 1.2.11 that

The operator κ(T ) is called the Cayley-transform of T ∈ Csa(H) and we note that

κ(T ) := (T − i)(T + i)−1 ∈ L(H).

κ(T ) = (T + i − 2i)(T + i)−1 = IH − 2i (T + i)−1.

Consequently, if T1, T2 ∈ Csa(H), then

kκ(T1) − κ(T2)k = 2k(T1 + i)−1 − (T2 + i)−1k

and κ : C sa(H) → L(H) is injective.
3.1.1 Deﬁnition. The gap metric on C sa(H) is deﬁned by

(3.1)

(3.2)

dG(T1, T2) = kκ(T1) − κ(T2)k.

Note that dG indeed deﬁnes a metric because of the injectivity of κ : C sa(H) → L(H). Moreover,
by (3.2) we obtain an equivalent metric δ by

30

CHAPTER 3. THE GAP TOPOLOGY

δ(T1, T2) = k(T1 + i)−1 − (T2 + i)−1k.

(3.3)

Let us recall that a linear operator U : H → H is called unitary if U∗ = U−1, and moreover
every surjective isometry is unitary. We prove the following results along the lines of §1.1 of

Booss-Bavnbek, Lesch and Phillips’ article [BLP05].

3.1.2 Theorem. If U is unitary and U − IH injective, then T := i(IH + U )(IH − U )−1 is
selfadjoint on D(T ) = im(IH − U ). Moreover, T = i(IH − U )−1(IH + U ).
Proof. Since U is in particular normal we see that ker(IH − U∗) = ker(IH − U ) and so

im(IH − U ) = ker(IH − U∗)⊥ = ker(IH − U )⊥ = H,
as IH − U is injective. Consequently, D(T ) = im(IH − U ) is dense. From

(IH − U )(IH + U ) = IH − U 2 = (IH + U )(IH − U )

we obtain

(IH + U )(IH − U )−1 = (IH − U )−1(IH − U )(IH + U )(IH − U )−1

= (IH − U )−1(IH + U ) |im(IH−U)⊂ (IH − U )−1(IH + U ).

(3.4)

(3.5)

On the other hand, if u ∈ D((IH −U )−1(IH +U )), then (IH +U )u ∈ D((IH −U )−1) = im(IH −U )
and accordingly there exists v ∈ H, such that (IH + U )u = (IH − U )v. We conclude that
u = (IH − U )v + (IH − U )u − u and hence

u =

1
2

(IH − U )(u + v) ∈ D((IH + U )(IH − U )−1).

We obtain from (3.5) that

T = i(IH + U )(IH − U )−1 = i(IH − U )−1(IH + U ).

As next step, we want to show that T is symmetric. If u, v ∈ D(T ) = im(IH − U ), then there
exist y, z ∈ H such that v = y − U y and T u = i(z + U z) and we get

hT u, vi = ihz + U z, y − U yi = i(hz, yi − hz, U yi + hU z, yi − hU z, U yi)

= ihU z, yi − ihz, U yi = hz − U z, i(y + U y)i = hu, T vi.

Hence T is symmetric and we obtain from Lemma 2.1.9

31

(3.6)

3.1. DEFINITION AND PROPERTIES

T ⊂ T ∗ = −i(IH − U∗)−1(IH + U∗).

By arguing verbatim for T ∗ as for T , we have

T ∗ = −i(IH − U∗)−1(IH + U∗) = −i(IH + U∗)(IH − U∗)−1

and so also T ∗ is symmetric. Hence

T ∗ ⊂ T ∗∗ = i(IH − U )−1(IH + U ) = T

and we conclude from (3.6) that T = T ∗.

We obtain two important corollaries from the previous theorem.

3.1.3 Corollary. If U and T are as in Theorem 3.1.2, then κ(T ) = U .

Proof. By Theorem 3.1.2 we have T = i(IH − U )−1(IH + U ). Hence

T + i = i(IH − U )−1(IH + U ) + i(IH − U )−1(IH − U ) = 2i(IH − U )−1,

and so

Analogously,

(T + i)−1 =

1
2i

(IH − U ).

T − i = i(IH − U )−1(IH + U ) − i(IH − U )−1(IH − U ) = 2i(IH − U )−1U

and we obtain

κ(T ) = (T − i)(T + i)−1 = (IH − U )−1U (IH − U ) = U.

3.1.4 Corollary. The Cayley transform κ induces a homeomorphism

κ : C sa(H) → {U ∈ L(H) : U∗ = U−1 , ker(U − IH ) = {0}} ⊂ L(H).

32

CHAPTER 3. THE GAP TOPOLOGY

Proof. By Theorem 3.1.2, we only have to show that U := κ(T ) is unitary and IH −κ(T ) injective
for all T ∈ C sa(H).
It is clear that U is surjective. For u ∈ D(T ) we have

kT u + iuk2 = hT u + iu, T u + iui = kT uk2 + kuk2 + ihu, T ui − ihT u, ui

= kT uk2 + kuk2 = kT u − iuk2

and since U (T u + iu) = T u − iu, we conclude that kU vk = kvk for all v ∈ H. Hence U is a
surjective isometry deﬁned on all of H, and consequently it is a unitary operator.
Now we assume that u ∈ H is such that κ(T )u = u. Then we obtain from (3.1)

and hence (T + i)−1u = 0 which implies that u = 0.

u = κ(T )u = u − 2i(T + i)−1u

Let us recall that

κ : R → S1,
induces a homeomorphism onto S1 \ {1} ⊂ C.
3.1.5 Lemma. If T ∈ Csa(H), then

κ(t) =

t − i
t + i

λ − T = (λ + i)(κ(λ) − κ(T ))(IH − κ(T ))−1.

Proof. This follows from

λ − T = λ − i(IH + κ(T ))(IH − κ(T ))−1 = (λ(IH − κ(T )) − i(IH + κ(T )))(IH − κ(T ))−1
= (λ − λκ(T ) − i − iκ(T ))(IH − κ(T ))−1 = ((λ − i) − (λ + i)κ(T ))(IH − κ(T ))−1
= (λ + i)((λ − i)(λ + i)−1 − κ(T ))(IH − κ(T ))−1 = (λ + i)(κ(λ) − κ(T ))(IH − κ(T ))−1.

As a consequence we obtain the following important corollary illustrating the relation between
the spectrum of an operator in C sa(H) and the spectrum of its Cayley transform.
3.1.6 Corollary. If T ∈ C sa(H), then
(i) ker(λ − T ) 6= {0} if and only if ker(κ(λ) − κ(T )) 6= {0}. Moreover the dimensions of both

spaces coincide.

(ii) im(λ − T ) = im(κ(λ) − κ(T )).

3.1. DEFINITION AND PROPERTIES

33

Moreover,

• λ ∈ ρ(T ) ⇐⇒ κ(λ) ∈ ρ(κ(T )),
• λ ∈ σ(T ) ⇐⇒ κ(λ) ∈ σ(κ(T )),
• λ ∈ σp(T ) ⇐⇒ κ(λ) ∈ σp(κ(T )),
• λ ∈ σess(T ) ⇐⇒ κ(λ) ∈ σess(κ(T )).

Proof. By the previous Lemma 3.1.5 we know that

λ − T = (λ + i)(κ(λ) − κ(T ))(IH − κ(T ))−1

and moreover (IH − κ(T ))−1 maps D(T ) bijectively onto H. This implies the assertions on
ker(λ − T ) and im(λ − T ). The remaining part of the corollary is an immediate consequence of
them.

3.1.7 Lemma. Let T ∈ C sa(H). Then
(i) 1 ∈ ρ(κ(T )) ⇐⇒ D(T ) = H, and this is true if and only if T is bounded.
(ii) 1 ∈ σess(κ(T )) ⇐⇒ D(T ) 6= H, and this is true if and only if T is unbounded.
Proof. The assertions regarding the boundedness and unboundedness of T follow from Lemma
1.2.5 and the assumption that T is densely deﬁned.

By (3.1) we have

IH − κ(T ) = 2i(T + i)−1 ∈ L(H)

mapping H bijectively onto D(T ). Accordingly, if 1 ∈ ρ(κ(T )), we infer H = im(IH − κ(T )) =
D(T ). Conversely, if D(T ) = H, then IH − κ(T ) maps H bijectively onto H showing that
1 ∈ ρ(κ(T )) by the closed graph theorem (Theorem 1.2.10). Hence assertion (i) is proved.
In order to show (ii) we note at ﬁrst that by (i), 1 ∈ σ(κ(T )) if and only if D(T ) 6= H. Now it
remains to show that if 1 ∈ σ(κ(T )), then we actually have 1 ∈ σess(κ(T )). But, if D(T ) 6= H,
we see that im(IH − κ(T )) = D(T ) is a proper dense subspace of H and hence in particular not
closed. Accordingly, IH − κ(T ) is not a Fredholm operator.
We obtain from Corollary 3.1.6:

3.1.8 Corollary. If T ∈ C sa(H), then
(i) κ(σ(T )) = σ(κ(T )) if T is bounded.

(ii) κ(σ(T )) ∪ {1} = σ(κ(T )) if T is unbounded.

34

CHAPTER 3. THE GAP TOPOLOGY

3.2 Stability of Spectra

We recall at ﬁrst the spectral stability for bounded operators:

3.2.1 Theorem. Let E be a Banach space, A ∈ L(E) and Ω ⊂ C an open neighbourhood of
σ(A). Then there exists ε > 0 such that σ(B) ⊂ Ω for any B ∈ L(E) with kA − Bk < ε.
Moreover, the same conclusion holds true if we replace σ by σess.

Proof. The spectral stability holds for any complex unital Banach algebra R (cf. e.g.
[He92,
96.5]), and so the ﬁrst assertion follows by setting R = L(E). For the stability of the essential
spectrum, we let R be the Calkin algebra Cal(E) = L(E)/K(E) of E and use that the quotient
map q : L(E) → Cal(E) is continuous.
The next two results can be found in [BLP05, §2.2].

3.2.2 Lemma. Let K ⊂ C be compact. Then

and

{T ∈ C sa(H) : K ⊂ ρ(T )}

{T ∈ C sa(H) : K ⊂ ρess(T )}

are open in C sa(H), where ρess(T ) := C \ σess(T ).
Proof. We denote by U(H) the set of all unitary operators acting on H. By using Corollary 3.1.6
and Corollary 3.1.8, we have

{T ∈ C sa(H) : K ⊂ ρ(T )} = {T ∈ C sa(H) : σ(T ) ⊂ (C \ K) ∩ R}

= {T ∈ C sa(H) : σ(κ(T )) ⊂ κ((C \ K) ∩ R) ∪ {1}}.

We conclude from Theorem 3.1.2 that

{T ∈ C sa(H) : K ⊂ ρ(T )} = κ−1({U ∈ U(H) : σ(U ) ⊂ κ((C \ K) ∩ R) ∪ {1}}).

As K is compact, the set κ((C \ K) ∩ R) ∪ {1} is open and we see from Theorem 3.2.1 that

{U ∈ U(H) : σ(U ) ⊂ κ((C \ K) ∩ R) ∪ {1}}

is open in L(H). Since κ is a homeomorphism by Theorem 3.1.2 , we obtain the assertion. The
proof for ρess(T ) proceeds along the same lines.

3.2.3 Theorem. Let ∅ 6= K ⊂ C and ΩK = {T ∈ C sa(H) : K ⊂ ρ(T )}. Then the map

R : K × ΩK → L(H),

(λ, T ) 7→ (T − λ)−1

is continuous.

3.2. STABILITY OF SPECTRA

Proof. We ﬁx z0 ∈ K and note that we have for (λ, T ) ∈ K × ΩK

R(λ, T ) = (T − λ)−1 = ((T − z0) − (λ − z0))−1

= ((T − z0)(IH − (λ − z0)(T − z0)−1))−1
= (IH − (λ − z0)(T − z0)−1)−1(T − z0)−1 = F (G(λ, T )),

where the maps F and G are deﬁned by1

35

(3.7)

G : K × ΩK → K × {S ∈ L(H) : (K − z0)−1 ⊂ ρ(S)},

(λ, T ) 7→ (λ, (T − z0)−1)

and

F :K × {S ∈ L(H) : (K − z0)−1 ⊂ ρ(S)} → L(H),

(λ, S) 7→ (IH − (λ − z0)S)−1S,

respectively. G is continuous as dG is equivalent to the metric (3.3). Furthermore, the continuity
of F follows by a simple computation using the continuity of the inversion on GL(H) (cf. [Ka76,
I.(4.24),III.3.1]).

As an important corollary of the previous theorem, we obtain the continuity of the spectral
projections which we introduced in Theorem 1.3.4.

3.2.4 Corollary. Let △ ⊂ C be a Cauchy domain with boundary Γ and

ΩΓ = {T ∈ C sa(H) : Γ ⊂ ρ(T )} ⊂ C sa(H).

ΩΓ → L(H),

T 7→ PΓ(T ) :=

1

2πi ZΓ

(λ − T )−1 dλ

Then the map

is continuous.

Proof. For any T, S ∈ ΩΓ we have by [He92, (97.4)]

kPΓ(T ) − PΓ(S)k ≤

1
2π|Γ| max

λ∈Γ k(λ − T )−1 − (λ − S)−1k,

1For A ⊂ C \ {0}, we denote A−1 = { 1

z ∈ C : z ∈ A}.

CHAPTER 3. THE GAP TOPOLOGY

where |Γ| denotes the length of the contour Γ. The rest of the proof is a standard argument in
analysis:
Let T ∈ ΩΓ and ε > 0. By Theorem 3.2.3 there exists δ(λ′) > 0 for any λ′ ∈ Γ such that

k(λ − S)−1 − (λ′ − T )−1k <

πε
|Γ|

if

λ ∈ U (λ′, δ(λ′)) := {λ ∈ Γ : |λ − λ′| < δ(λ′)}
As Γ is compact we can ﬁnd λ1, . . . , λn ∈ Γ such that Sn
min1≤i≤n δ(λi).
Now, for any λ ∈ Γ there exists 1 ≤ i ≤ n such that λ ∈ U (λi, δ(λi)) and hence we obtain for
S ∈ ΩΓ such that dG(S, T ) < δ,

i=1 U (λi, δ(λi)) = Γ, and we set δ :=

and dG(S, T ) < δ(λ′).

k(λ − T )−1 − (λ − S)−1k ≤ k(λ − T )−1 − (λi − T )−1k + k(λi − T )−1 − (λ − S)−1k <

We get by (3.8)

λ∈Γ k(λ − T )−1 − (λ − S)−1k < ε

for all S ∈ ΩΓ such that dG(S, T ) < δ.

3.3 Spaces of Selfadjoint Fredholm Operators

In this section, we brieﬂy consider diﬀerent topologies on spaces of selfadjoint Fredholm operators

following mainly Lesch’s work [Le05]. We set

CF sa(H) = {T ∈ C sa(H) : T Fredholm}

and recall that CF sa(H) is a metric space with respect to the gap metric

dG(T1, T2) = kκ(T1) − κ(T2)k, T1, T2 ∈ CF sa(H).

For T ∈ C sa(H) one can show that IH + T 2 is invertible and selfadjoint on D(T 2) ⊂ D(T ). We
obtain from Lemma 1.2.11 that F (T ) := T (IH + T 2)− 1
2 ∈ L(H). The Riesz metric on CF sa(H)
is deﬁned by

dR(T1, T2) = kF (T1) − F (T2)k,

T1, T2 ∈ CF sa(H).

3.3. SPACES OF SELFADJOINT FREDHOLM OPERATORS

37

We set

BF sa(H) = {T ∈ CF sa(H) : D(T ) = H}

and note that we have a metric on BF sa(H) given by

The following result is due to Nicolaescu [Ni07].

dN (T1, T2) = kT1 − T2k, T1, T2 ∈ BF sa(H).

3.3.1 Theorem. The topology induced by the Riesz metric on CF sa(H) is strictly ﬁner than the
topology induced by the gap metric.

Note that the theorem implies in particular that every path in CF sa(H) which is continuous
with respect to the Riesz metric is also continuous with respect to the gap metric. Let us now
consider BF sa(H) and let us note a classical result by Cordes and Labrousse [CL63]:
3.3.2 Theorem. On BF sa(H) the topologies induced by dN , dR and dG coincide.
The space BF sa(H) was investigated by Atiyah and Singer in [AS69] and it plays a fundamental
role in topology.

3.3.3 Theorem. The space BF sa(H) consists of three connected components

BF sa

to the previously mentioned results:

3.3.4 Theorem. The space CF sa(H) is connected with respect to the gap metric.

The Spectral Flow

4.1 Deﬁnition of the Spectral Flow

The aim of this section is to introduce the spectral ﬂow along the lines of [BLP05, §2.2]. Before

we begin the construction, we rephrase the results about the spectral stability from Section 3.2.
In what follows, we denote for T ∈ CF sa(H) such that a, b /∈ σ(T ) by

χ[a,b](T ) =

1

2πi ZΓ

(λ − T )−1 dλ

the spectral projection with respect to the interval [a, b], where Γ is the circle of radius b−a
2
around a+b

2 . Moreover, we will need the following well known fact.

4.1.1 Lemma. Let P, Q ∈ L(E) be two projections on the Banach space E. If kP − Qk < 1,
then

Proof. [GGK90, Lemma II.4.3]

dim im(P ) = dim im(Q).

The next lemma is a cornerstone in the deﬁnition of the spectral ﬂow.

4.1.2 Lemma. Let T0 ∈ CF sa(H) be given.
(i) There exists a positive real number a such that ±a /∈ σ(T0), and an open neighbourhood

N ⊂ CF sa(H) of T0 such that

N → L(H),

T 7→ χ[−a,a](T )

(4.1)

is continuous and, moreover, σess(T ) ∩ [−a, a] = ∅ and the projection χ[−a,a](T ) has ﬁnite
rank for all T ∈ N .

39

40

CHAPTER 4. THE SPECTRAL FLOW

(ii) If −a ≤ c < d ≤ a are such that c, d ∈ ρ(T ) for all T ∈ N , then T 7→ χ[c,d](T ) is continuous
on N . Moreover, the rank of χ[c,d](T ), T ∈ N , is ﬁnite and constant on each connected
component of N .

Proof. By Lemma 2.2.5 there exists a > 0 such that [−a, a] ∩ σ(T0) ⊂ {0}. Now

N := {T ∈ CF sa(H) : [−a, a] ⊂ ρess(T0), ±a /∈ σ(T0)}

is open with respect to the gap metric by Lemma 3.2.2 and the map (4.1) is continuous by
Corollary 3.2.4. Moreover, χ[−a,a](T ) has ﬁnite rank for all T ∈ N as [−a, a] ∩ σess(T ) = ∅.
Hence we have shown the ﬁrst assertion. The second assertion now follows immediately from

Corollary 3.2.4.

Note that if c, d and N are as in (ii) of the previous lemma, then

im(χ[c,d](T )) = Mµ∈[c,d]

ker(µ − T ) ⊂ H

for all T ∈ N .
Let now A : I → CF sa(H) be a continuous path with respect to the gap topology, where we
denote by I = [0, 1] the unit interval. By the previous Lemma 4.1.2 we conclude that for every
λ ∈ I there exists a > 0 and an open neighbourhood Nλ,a ⊂ CF sa(H) such that ±a ∈ ρ(T ) for
all T ∈ Nλ,a and the map

Nλ,a → L(H),

T 7→ χ[−a,a](T )

is continuous. Moreover, all χ[−a,a](T ), T ∈ Nλ,a, have the same ﬁnite rank. Now the counterim-
ages of the Nλ,a under A deﬁne an open covering of the unit interval and, by using the Lebesgue
number of this covering, we can ﬁnd 0 = λ0 ≤ λ1 ≤ . . . ≤ λn = 1 and ai > 0, i = 1, . . . n, such
that the maps

[λi−1, λi] ∋ λ 7→ χ[−ai,ai](Aλ) ∈ L(H)

are continuous and of constant rank. In what follows we denote for [c, d] ⊂ [−ai, ai] by

E[c,d](Aλ) = Mµ∈[c,d]
the direct sum of the eigenspaces with respect to eigenvalues in the interval [c, d]. Our intention
is to deﬁne the spectral ﬂow of A : I → CF sa(H) by

ker(µ − Aλ)

sf(A) =

n

Xi=1(cid:0)dim E[0,ai](Aλi ) − dim E[0,ai](Aλi−1 )(cid:1)

(4.2)

but we need to prove its well deﬁnedness before.

4.1. DEFINITION OF THE SPECTRAL FLOW

41

4.1.3 Lemma. sf(A) depends only on the continuous map A.
Proof. We decompose the proof into three steps.
Let us begin by considering λ0, . . . , λn and a1, . . . , an as in (4.2), and we take a further instant
λ∗ ∈ (0, 1) such that λi−1 < λ∗ < λi for some i. If we now use the two maps

[λi−1, λ∗] ∋ λ 7→ χ[−ai,ai](Aλ),

[λ∗, λi] ∋ λ 7→ χ[−ai,ai](Aλ)

instead of

[λi−1, λi] ∋ λ 7→ χ[−ai,ai](Aλ)

for the computation of (4.2), then the sum does not change as the two new appearing terms

cancel each other.
In the second step we do not change the partition of the interval but instead the numbers ai.
Let [c, d] ⊂ [0, 1] be any subinterval and

λ 7→ χ[−a1,a1](Aλ),

λ 7→ χ[−a2,a2](Aλ)

two continuous maps as in (4.2) which are deﬁned and continuous on [c, d]. We may assume
without loss of generality that a1 is greater or equal to a2. As a1, a2 /∈ σ(Aλ) for all λ ∈ [c, d],
we obtain by Theorem 1.3.4

dim E[0,a1](Aλ) − dim E[0,a2](Aλ) = dim im(χ[a2,a1](Aλ))

which is a constant function on [c, d] by Lemma 4.1.2 (ii). Consequently,

dim E[0,a1](Ad) − dim E[0,a1](Ac) = (dim E[0,a2](Ad) + dim im(χ[a2,a1](Ad))
− (dim E[0,a2](Ac) + dim im(χ[a2,a1](Ac)))
= dim E[0,a2](Ad) − dim E[0,a2](Ac).

Finally, let us consider the general case, i.e. we have two partitions λ0, . . . , λn and λ′0, . . . , λ′m
having associated numbers a1, . . . , an and a′1, . . . , a′m, respectively, as in (4.2). The union of both
partitions yield a third one λ′′0 , . . . , λ′′m+n, which is ﬁner than λ0, . . . , λn and λ′1, . . . , λ′m. By our
ﬁrst step of the proof we obtain

for suitable b1, . . . , bm+n ∈ {a1, . . . , an} and b′1, . . . , b′m+n ∈ {a′1, . . . a′m}. Now the same partition
is used on the right hand sides in (4.3), and so these sums are equal by the second step of our

proof.

Let us point out that we have deﬁned the spectral ﬂow for paths that are parametrised by the
unit interval only for the sake of simplicity of notation. Clearly, the same formula as (4.2) can
be used to deﬁne sf(A) for paths A : [a, b] → CF sa(H), where [a, b] ⊂ R is a compact interval.
In what follows, we will use this without further mention.

4.2 Properties and Uniqueness

In this section we introduce the basic properties of the spectral ﬂow, where we follow essentially
[Ph96]. We begin with some simple observations that all follow from its construction.

4.2.1 Lemma. Let N ⊂ CF sa(H) be a neighbourhood as in the construction of the spectral ﬂow,
i.e. there exists a > 0 such that −a, a ∈ ρ(T ), [−a, a] ∩ σess(T ) = ∅ for all T ∈ N , the map

N ∋ T 7→ χ[−a,a](T ) ∈ L(H)

is continuous and all χ[−a,a](T ) have the same ﬁnite rank.
If A1,A2 : I → CF sa(H) are gap continuous and

A1(I),A2(I) ⊂ N, A1

1 = A2
1,

0 = A2

0, A1

(4.4)

then

Proof. We obtain from (4.4) and the deﬁnition (4.2)

sf(A1) = sf(A2).

sf(A1) = dim E[0,a](A1
= dim E[0,a](A2

1) − dim E[0,a](A1
0)
1) − dim E[0,a](A2
0) = sf(A2).

4.2.2 Lemma.

then

(i) If A1,A2 : I → CF sa(H) are two gap continuous paths such that A2

0 = A1
1,

sf(A1 ∗ A2) = sf(A1) + sf(A2).

4.2. PROPERTIES AND UNIQUENESS

43

(ii) If A : I → CF sa(H) is gap continuous and A′ is deﬁned by A′t = A1−t, then

sf(A′) = − sf(A).

(iii) If A : I → CF sa(H) is gap continuous and At is invertible for all t ∈ I, then sf(A) = 0.
Proof. The ﬁrst two assertions follow immediately from the deﬁnition (4.2). For the third asser-
tion we just have to observe that by Lemma 3.2.2 we can ﬁnd δ > 0 such that σ(Aλ)∩ [−δ, δ] = ∅
for all λ ∈ [0, 1]. Then

sf(A) = dim E[0,δ](A1) − dim E[0,δ](A0) = 0.

In what follows we set

GC sa(H) = {T ∈ C sa(H) : T invertible}.

The probably most important property of the spectral ﬂow is its homotopy invariance which we
prove in the following lemma.

4.2.3 Lemma. Let h : I × I → CF sa(H) be a continuous map such that

Then

h(I × ∂I) ⊂ GCsa(H).

sf(h(0,·)) = sf(h(1,·)).

Proof. As h(I × I) ⊂ CF sa(H) is compact, we can ﬁnd a ﬁnite open covering

h(I × I) ⊂

n

[i=1

Ni,

where Ni ⊂ CF sa(H), i = 1, . . . , n, are open sets as in the construction of the spectral ﬂow.
Accordingly, for each Ni there exists ai > 0 such that −ai, ai ∈ ρ(T ), [−ai, ai] ∩ σess(T ) = ∅ for
all T ∈ Ni, the map

Ni ∋ T 7→ χ[−ai,ai](T ) ∈ L(H)

44

CHAPTER 4. THE SPECTRAL FLOW

is continuous and all χ[−ai,ai](T ) are projections of the same ﬁnite rank.
If ε0 > 0 is a Lebesgue number of the open covering

I × I =

n

[i=1

h−1(Ni),

then each subset of I × I of diameter less than ε0 is entirely contained in one of the h−1(Ni).
We choose numbers 0 = λ0 < λ1 < . . . < λm = 1 such that |λi − λi−1| < ε0√2
, 1 ≤ i ≤ m. Then
for each pair 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m, h([λi−1, λi]× [λj−1, λj]) is contained in one of the Nk. Now we obtain
for any h |[λi−1,λi]×[λj−1,λj ] from Lemma 4.2.1 and Lemma 4.2.2

sf(h(λi−1,·) |[λj−1,λj ]) = sf(h(·, λj−1) |[λi−1,λi]) + sf(h(λi,·) |[λj−1 ,λj ])

− sf(h(·, λj) |[λi−1,λi]).

Moreover,

sf(h(·, 0) |[λi−1,λi]) = sf(h(·, 1) |[λi−1,λi]) = 0,

i = 1, . . . , m,

by the third part of Lemma 4.2.2. By using the ﬁrst part of Lemma 4.2.2 once again, we obtain

sf(h(λi−1,·)) =

=

=

Hence

m

m

Xj=1
Xj=1
Xj=1

sf(h(λi−1,·) |[λj−1 ,λj ])

sf(h(·, λj−1) |[λi−1,λi]) + sf(h(λi,·) |[λj−1,λj ]) − sf(h(·, λj ) |[λi−1,λi])

sf(h(λi,·) |[λj−1 ,λj ]) = sf(h(λi,·)).

sf(h(0,·)) = sf(h(λ0,·)) = sf(h(λ1,·)) = sf(h(1,·)).

We now want to discuss a normalisation property, which is needed for the uniqueness of the
spectral ﬂow. Let {ek}k∈Z be a complete orthonormal system of the Hilbert space H, which
we now assume to be separable. Denote by P+ the orthogonal projection onto the closure of
the space spanned by {ek}k∈N, by P− the orthogonal projection onto the closure of the space
spanned by {e−k}k∈N, and by P0 the orthogonal projection onto the span of e0. Then

4.2. PROPERTIES AND UNIQUENESS

45

and moreover the operator

P+ + P− + P0 = IH

Lλ = λP0 + P+ − P−

is for each λ ∈ [−1, 1] a bounded selfadjoint Fredholm operator. More precisely, Lλ ∈ GL(H) as
long as λ 6= 0, and in the remaining case L0 has a one dimensional kernel and cokernel which are
both given by the span of e0. Moreover, Lλ is obviously a continuous path with respect to the
norm topology and thus continuous with respect to the gap topology as well. Hence the spectral

ﬂow of L is well deﬁned. As

it is immediate from the deﬁnition that

σ(Lλ) = {−1, 1, λ}, λ ∈ [−1, 1],

Moreover, we note that if we set T0 = P+ + P0 − P− and P = P0, then

sf(L) = 1.

(IH − P )T0(IH − P ) = (IH − P0)(P+ + P0 − P−)(IH − P0) = (IH − P0)(P+ − P−) = P+ − P−.
In particular, (IH − P )T0(IH − P ) deﬁnes a bounded, invertible and selfadjoint operator on ker P
such that the path

λP + (IH − P )T0(IH − P ) = Lλ,

λ ∈ [−1, 1],

has spectral ﬂow 1.

Now we ﬁnally state the so called uniqueness of spectral ﬂow which is the main result of [Le05].
For a topological space X and a subspace Y ⊂ X, we use the common notation Ω(X, Y ) for the
set of all paths in X having endpoints in Y .

4.2.4 Theorem. Let H be a separable Hilbert space and let

µ : Ω(CF sa(H), GCsa(H)) → Z

be a map which is additive with respect to concatenation of paths, invariant under gap contin-
uous homotopies inside Ω(CF sa(H), GCsa(H)) and which satisﬁes the following normalisation

46

CHAPTER 4. THE SPECTRAL FLOW

condition:
There is a rank one orthogonal projection P ∈ L(H) and a bounded selfadjoint operator T0 having
σ(T0) = {−1, 1} such that the selfadjoint operator (IH − P )T0(IH − P ) is invertible on ker P and

where Lλ = λP + (IH − P )T0(IH − P ), λ ∈ [−1, 1].
Then µ is the spectral ﬂow.

µ(L) = 1,

Note that we have veriﬁed in this section that the spectral ﬂow indeed has all the properties

mentioned in its uniqueness theorem. In the proof of Theorem 4.2.4 in [Le05], it is shown that
any gap continuous path can be deformed into a path in a certain normal form in which the

spectral ﬂow can be computed by considering ﬁnite dimensional matrices. Then the uniqueness
of spectral ﬂow follows from a corresponding result in ﬁnite dimensions which can also be found

in [Le05].

4.3 Crossing Forms

In this section we brieﬂy discuss a method which is often helpful for computing the spectral

ﬂow and which was introduced in [RS95] and [FPR99], respectively, and recently generalised by
the author in [Wa15b]. To this aim we have to restrict our considerations to special paths in
CF sa(H).
Let W ⊂ H be a Hilbert space in its own right and assume that W ֒→ H is continuous (e.g.,
W = H, or W = H 1[0, 1], H = L2[0, 1]). We denote by BF sa(W, H) the set of all T ∈ CF sa(H)
such that D(T ) = W and T ∈ L(W, H). In what follows we consider BF sa(W, H) as a topological
subspace of the Banach space L(W, H). It is shown in [Le05, Prop. 2.2] that the inclusion

BF sa(W, H) ֒→ CF sa(H)

is continuous but not a topological embedding, i.e. the resulting topology on BF sa(W, H) is
strictly stronger than the gap topology. From now on we assume that A : I → BF sa(W, H) is a
continuously diﬀerentiable path.

4.3.1 Deﬁnition. An instant λ0 ∈ [0, 1] is called a crossing if ker(Aλ0 ) 6= 0. The crossing form
at a crossing λ0 is the quadratic form deﬁned by

Γ(A, λ0) : ker(Aλ0 ) → R, Γ(A, λ0)[u] = h(

d
dλ |λ=λ0 Aλ)u, uiH .

A crossing λ0 is called regular, if Γ(A, λ0) is non-degenerate.
We mention without proof the following two theorems.

4.3.2 Theorem. There exists ε > 0 such that

4.3. CROSSING FORMS

47

i) A + δ IH is a path in BF sa(W, H) for all |δ| < ε;
ii) A + δ IH has only regular crossings for almost every δ ∈ (−ε, ε).

For a quadratic form q : V → R on a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space V , there is a unique
Hermitian matrix A such that q(u) = hAu, ui for all u ∈ V .
In what follows, we denote by
m−(q) the number of negative eigenvalues of A counted with multiplicities, and we set m+(q) :=
m−(−A) as well as sgn(q) := m+(q) − m−(q).
The following theorem shows that the spectral ﬂow of a continuously diﬀerentiable path A in
BF sa(W, H) can be computed easily if all crossings are regular.
4.3.3 Theorem. If A has only regular crossings, then they are ﬁnite in number and

sf(A) = −m−(Γ(A, 0)) + Xλ∈(0,1)

sgn Γ(A, λ) + m+(Γ(A, 1)).

(4.5)

Theorem 4.3.2 and Theorem 4.3.3 were ﬁrstly proved by Robbin and Salamon in [RS95] under
the additional assumption that W is compactly embedded in H. Later Fitzpatrick, Pejsachowicz

and Recht proved Theorem 4.3.3 for bounded operators, i.e. if W = H. Note that the latter case
is not covered by Robbin and Salamon’s theorem as the inclusion W ֒→ H is not compact if W
and H are of inﬁnite dimension. A proof of both Theorems in the generality stated above can
be found in [Wa15b]. Finally, let us mention that crossing forms can also be deﬁned for paths of

operators having varying domains [SW08, App.A].

48

CHAPTER 4. THE SPECTRAL FLOW

Chapter 5

A Simple Example and a Glimpse at

the Literature

5.1 A Simple Example

In this section we consider the Hilbert space H = L2[0, 1] and the diﬀerential operators Aλu = iu′
on the domains

D(Aλ) = {u ∈ H 1[0, 1] : u(0) = eiλu(1)}.

Our aim is to show that {Aλ}λ∈[−π,π] is a continuous path in CF sa(H) and we want to compute
its spectral ﬂow.

The operators Aλ are selfadjoint and Fredholm
We have already seen in Example 2.1.12 that Aλ is selfadjoint for all λ. Moreover, we have
shown that Aλ is surjective if λ 6= 0. As the kernel of Aλ is trivial in this case, we see that
Aλ ∈ CF sa(H) for λ 6= 0. Let us now consider the operator A0. Clearly, ker(A0) consists of all
constant functions on [0, 1] and, moreover, it is readily seen that the image of A0 is

im(A0) = {v ∈ L2[0, 1] : Z 1

0

v(t) dt = 0},

which is closed. Indeed, if {vn}n∈N is a sequence in im(A0) converging to some v ∈ H, then

Z 1

0

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

vn(t) − v(t) dt(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ kvn − vkH → 0, n → ∞,

and so v ∈ im(A). Hence A0 ∈ CF sa(H) by Lemma 2.1.7.
Let us note that there is another way to check that A0 is Fredholm. If we let Y denote the
subspace of H consisting of all constant functions, then we have a direct sum decomposition

v(t) dt(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

= (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Z 1

0

49

50

CHAPTER 5. A SIMPLE EXAMPLE AND A GLIMPSE AT THE LITERATURE

H = im(A0)⊕ Y . Indeed, the intersection of these spaces is trivial and, moreover, every function
v ∈ H can be written as

v(t) = (cid:18)v(t) −Z 1
{z

v(t) dt(cid:19)
}

+Z 1

v(t) dt

.

∈Y

{z

}

As the kernel of A0 is of ﬁnite dimension, this shows that A0 is Fredholm by Lemma 1.1.11.

The path {Aλ}λ∈[−π,π] is continuous
We deﬁne Tλ : H → H by Tλ = (Aλ + i)−1 and note that by (3.2) we need to show that Tλ is
a continuous path of bounded operators on H. To this aim, we will ﬁrst compute Tλ explicitly.
If v ∈ H, then u := Tλv is a solution of iu′ + iu = v, and we obtain from standard methods for
ordinary diﬀerential equations that

u(t) = ce−t − ie−tZ t

0

v(s)es ds,

t ∈ [0, 1],

for some constant c depending on λ and v. As u ∈ D(Aλ), we have to require that

c = u(0) = eiλu(1) = eiλ(cid:18)ce−1 − ie−1Z 1

0

v(s)es ds(cid:19) ,

which implies that

c = −

and so we ﬁnally obtain

i

e1−iλ − 1 Z 1

0

v(s)es ds =: m(λ) Z 1

0

v(s)es ds,

(Tλv)(t) = m(λ) e−tZ 1

0

v(s)es ds − ie−tZ t

0

v(s)es ds.

Clearly, m : [−π, π] → C is a continuous function. If now λ0, λ1 ∈ [−π, π], then it is readily seen
that

kTλ1v − Tλ0 vkH ≤

1

√2pcosh(2) − 1 |m(λ1) − m(λ0)|kvkH .

Consequently, {Tλ}λ∈[−π,π] is a continuous path of bounded operators on H = L2[0, 1] showing
the continuity of A in CF sa(H).

The spectral ﬂow of {Aλ}λ∈[−π,π]
In order to compute the spectra of the operators Aλ, we need to consider the diﬀerential equations

iu′ − µu = 0,

5.2. A GLIMPSE AT THE LITERATURE

51

where µ is a real number. Clearly, the solution of this equation is given by u(t) = ce−iµt, t ∈ [0, 1],
for some constant c. As u is an element of D(Aλ), we get in addition

c = u(0) = eiλu(1) = cei(λ−µ),

and so λ − µ = 2kπ for some k ∈ Z. Consequently, we see that

σ(Aλ) = {2kπ + λ : k ∈ Z}

the corresponding eigenspace is one

and each element in σ(Aλ) is a simple eigenvalue, i.e.
dimensional.
For the computation of the spectral ﬂow, we set λ0 = −π, λ1 = − π
2 and a3 = π
well as a1 = π
dim E[0,ai](Aλi−1 ) = 0 for all i. Hence

8 , a2 = π

4 and λ3 = π, as
8 . Then dim E[0,ai](Aλi ) 6= 0 only if i = 2, and moreover

4 , λ2 = π

sf(A) = 1.

Note that the path A is closed and hence we have found a non-trivial element in π1(CF sa(H)).
This shows in particular that the spectral ﬂow does not only depend on the endpoints of a path,
for otherwise sf(A) = 0 for every closed path A.

5.2 A Glimpse at the Literature

In this ﬁnal section we provide some literature on the spectral ﬂow and its applications. Let
us emphasise that our selection of articles is highly subjective and not at all an attempt for an

exhaustive overview of the existing literature. It reﬂects the author’s personal interests and we
apologise to everyone not mentioned in the following paragraphs.

Deﬁnition of the Spectral Flow

The spectral ﬂow was introduced by Atiyah, Patodi and Singer in [APS76] for paths in BF sa(H),
and consequently also on CF sa(H) with respect to the Riesz metric (cf. Section 3.3). A more
analytic approach was given by Floer in [Fl88] and later fully developed by Phillips in [Ph96].
Alternative constructions can be found in [RS95], for paths in BF sa(W, H), and in [FPR99] for
paths in BF sa(H). That the spectral ﬂow can even be deﬁned for paths of unbounded selfadjoint
Fredholm operators which are merely continuous in the gap topology was observed by Booss-

Bavnbek, Lesch and Phillips in [BLP05]. Finally, let us mention that Wahl introduced in [W08a]
a topology on CF sa(H) which is even weaker than the gap topology and she extended the spectral
ﬂow to this setting.

52

CHAPTER 5. A SIMPLE EXAMPLE AND A GLIMPSE AT THE LITERATURE

Uniqueness of the Spectral Flow

As discussed in Section 4.2, one may ask which properties characterise the spectral ﬂow. Theorem
4.2.4 was proved by Lesch in [Le05] and the same source also discusses uniqueness for CF sa(H)
with respect to the Riesz metric, for BF sa(W, H) and for BF sa(H). An alternative approach for
paths in BF sa(H) can be found in [CFP00]. Robbin and Salamon proved in [RS95] uniqueness
for BF sa(W, H) if W is compactly embedded in H.

Crossing Forms and Partial Signatures

Crossing forms and partial signatures are convenient tools to compute spectral ﬂows. Crossing

forms were introduced by Robbin and Salamon in [RS95], and later adapted in [FPR99] and
[Wa15b]. For partial signatures we refer to [GPP04], and their application in [EP07].

Global Analysis

Beginning from Atiyah, Patodi and Singer’s article [APS76], probably most applications of the

spectral ﬂow were obtained in global analysis and related ﬁelds. We are deﬁnitely unable to give
an exhaustive list of literature, and so we just want to mention [BW85], [Ge93], [Bu94], [JL09]

and that many applications deal with boundary value problems for Dirac operators, e.g. [Bu95],
[Ni95], [LW96], [BBB04], [KL04], [GPP04], [Pr13] and [GL15]. Some of these works equate the

spectral ﬂow in this setting with Maslov indices for curves of Lagrangian subspaces in inﬁnite
dimensional symplectic spaces (cf. [BZ13]). Let us ﬁnally mention the author’s contributions in

[Wa13] and with Bei in [BeW15].

Symplectic Analysis

Floer used the spectral ﬂow in connection with his celebrated homology groups in [Fl88]. As in
global analysis, there are too many papers dealing with the spectral ﬂow in symplectic analysis to

give an exhaustive bibliography. Let us just mention [Ta90], [Yo91], [RS95], [Se08], [SW08] and
[MP11]. Also Kronheimer and Mrowka’s monograph [KM07] contains a section on the spectral

ﬂow, to which we refer for further literature.

Mathematical Physics

Vafa and Witten used the spectral ﬂow in [VW84] to obtain bounds on eigenvalues of Dirac
operators (cf. also [At85]). More recent applications can be found, e.g., in [BEL07], [Pu08],

[GLM11], [KN12], [SB14] and [BS15], among many others.

5.2. A GLIMPSE AT THE LITERATURE

53

Higher Spectral Flows

The spectral ﬂow was generalised to several-parameter families under additional assumptions by

Dai and Zhang in [DZ96] and [DZ98], where it is no longer an integer but a K-theory class of
the parameter space. A central element in this construction are spectral sections, which were

introduced by Melrose and Piazza in [MP97].

Spectral Flow and Operator Algebras

There is a vast literature on diﬀerent extensions of the construction of the spectral ﬂow to more

general settings. As we are hardly acquainted with these topics, we just want to quote without
further comments [Per95], [Ph97], [CP98] [LP03], [W07b], [W08b], [AW11] and [KL13].

Nonlinear Analysis

Fitzpatrick, Pejsachowicz and Recht discovered in [FPR99] that the spectral ﬂow can also be used
in the bifurcation theory of critical points of strongly indeﬁnite functionals on Hilbert spaces,

for which they introduced an alternative construction of the spectral ﬂow. Their result was later
improved in [PeW13] by Pejsachowicz in a joint work with the author. Recently, Alexander and

Fitzpatrick revisited the spectral ﬂow in bifurcation theory in [AF16].

2nd order Partial Diﬀerential Equations

Formulas for the spectral ﬂow for paths of second order PDEs can be found, e.g., in the recent
work [GS16] by Goﬀeng and Schrohe, as well as the author’s papers [PW15] with Portaluri and

[Wa16].

Hamiltonian Systems

The bifurcation theory developed in [FPR99] was ﬁrstly applied to bifurcation of periodic orbits

of Hamiltonian systems in [FPR00]. Further applications of the spectral ﬂow in case of periodic
orbits can be found in [RS95], [Iz99], [PeW13] and [Wa15a]. The spectral ﬂow for homoclinic solu-

tions was considered in [CH07], [Pe08b] and [Wa15b]. Also the works [MPP05], [Zh06], [MPP07]
and [Wa12] on a generalisation of the Morse index theorem to geodesics in semi-Riemannian

manifolds may be considered as an application to Hamiltonian Systems.
