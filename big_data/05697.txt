A LOWER BOUND FOR THE Θ FUNCTION ON MANIFOLDS

WITHOUT CONJUGATE POINTS.

YANNICK BONTHONNEAU

Abstract. In this short note, we prove that the usual Θ function on a Riemannian manifold
without conjugate points is uniformly bounded from below. This extends a result of Green in
two dimensions. This elementary lemma implies that the Bérard remainder in the Weyl law
is valid for a manifold without conjugate points, without any restriction on the dimension.

1. Introduction

Let (M, g) be a compact manifold of dimension n. Then the spectrum of its Laplacian is

discrete. We denote the eigenvalues by µ0 = 0 < µ1 ≤ . . . , and its counting function by

N (λ) := #{µi ≤ λ2}.

In 1977, Bérard proved the following:

Theorem 1 ([Bér77]). Assume that n = 2 and M has no conjugate points, or that M has
non-positive sectional curvature. Then, as λ tends to inﬁnity,

(1)

N (λ) =

In this note, we prove

vol(B∗M )

(2π)n λn + O(cid:18) λn−1
log λ(cid:19) .

Theorem 2. It suﬃces to assume that M does not have conjugate points to obtain the above
result.

This really is an improvement of theorem 1, as there exist manifolds without conjugate
points whose curvature has no sign. One can ﬁnd such examples in Gulliver [Gul75], or
Ballmann-Brin-Burns [BBB87].

We will not enter into all the details of the original proof, as we will just make an observation
on a crucial point in the arguments of Bérard. To obtain the theorem, Bérard studied the
local behaviour of the wave trace via the Hadamard parametrix. The kernel K(t, x, x′) of the

wave operator cos t√−∆ on fM – the universal cover of M – has an expansion of the form

(t2 − d(x, x′)2)k−(n+1)/2

mod (C ∞)

(2)

K(t, x, x′) = C0Xk≥0

uk(x, x′)|t|

Γ(k − (n − 1)/2)

The coeﬃcients uk satisfy certain transport equations along the geodesic between x and x′.
The expansion (2) is valid on the universal cover of M as soon as M has no conjugate points.
A critical part of the proof of Bérard, which is the only spot where the negative curvature
assumption is used, is the lemma:

YANNICK BONTHONNEAU

Lemma 1.1 ([Bér77]). Let (N, g) be the universal cover of a compact manifold without con-
jugate points. When n = 2 or if the curvature is non-positive, for all k ≥ 0 and l ≥ 0,

x′uk(x, x′) = O(1)eO(d(x,x′)).
∆l

To prove theorem 2, it suﬃces to establish

Lemma 1.2. The conclusion of lemma 1.1 holds with the sole assumption that (N, g) is
a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold without conjugate points and bounded
geometry.

The assumption of bounded geometry means here that the curvature tensor and all its
covariant derivatives are bounded on N , since expx is a global diﬀeomorphism for any x ∈ N .
Remark 1. In [HT15], Hassell and Tacy gave a uniform logarithmic improvement on the Lp
norms of eigenfunctions, with the same assumptions on the manifold as in Bérard’s theorem.
According to their proof, the reason why they need non-positive curvature in dimension n > 2
is that they use lemma 1.1. Their result can thus be generalized to all closed manifolds without
conjugate points.

To understand the proof, we need to introduce the Θ function, announced in the title: for

x, x′ ∈ N

Θ(x, x′) = det Texp−1

x (x′) expx .

x (x′) expx is a linear application between TxN and Tx′N , this determinant is naturally
As Texp−1
computed taking as reference the volume form d volg at the points x and x′. We also deﬁne

Now, we can give an explicit expression for the coeﬃcients uk (see [Bér77]):

ϑ(x, x′) = d(x, x′)n−1Θ(x, x′).

u0(x, x′) =

uk+1(x, x′) =

skpΘ(x, xs)(−∆x′uk)(x, xs)ds.

where x′ = expx(ru) and xs = expx(su). When investigating the Weyl law for some non-
compact manifolds of ﬁnite volume with hyperbolic cusps (see [Bon15]), it was convenient to
introduce a modiﬁed version of the Hadamard parametrix. This involved new coeﬃcients ˜uk,
which satisfy

˜u0(x, x′) =r sinh(r)n−1

ϑ(x, x′)(cid:0)−∆x′ + k2 − n + 1(cid:1) ˜uk(x, xs)ds,

still with r = d(x, x′). The proof of lemma 1.1 which can be found in the appendix of Bérard’s
article is suﬃciently robust so that we can make two remarks:

• The same proof with the same result applies to the coeﬃcients ˜uk.

• To complete the proof in the general case, it suﬃces to prove the most basic estimate,
that is, u0 = O(1)eO(d(x,x′)). This fact was actually hinted at in the last remark of
Bérard’s paper.

The proof of lemma 1.2 will therefore be complete if we can prove this Riemannian geometry

lemma:

Lemma 1.3. Assume that (N, g) is a complete simply-connected manifold without conjugate
points, and bounded sectional curvature. For all ǫ > 0, there is a constant C > 0 so that
ϑ(x, x′) > C whenever d(x, x′) > ǫ.

The rest of this note is devoted to the proof of this lemma. For surfaces, it is due to Green
(see lemma 2 in [Gre56]). While it may have been known for a while, we did not ﬁnd any
published statement, or proof, for the general case. In Eberlein [Ebe73], one can ﬁnd a proof
that for any (x, u), limt→∞ ϑ(x, expx(tu)) = +∞, but the convergence is not uniform in (x, u)
in higher dimension, so that this is not enough to deduce lemma 1.3. As a special case, Goto
[Got78] proved the lemma for manifolds with no focal points.

Acknowledgement It was a great pleasure to discuss the matters of this note with Pierre
H. Bérard. He communicated a note [Bér16] with a diﬀerent take on the proof of lemma 1.3,
via Bochner’s formula.

2. Proof

The arguments we use are somewhat elementary, and they are inspired by the original
proof of Green [Gre58], and some arguments from Eberlein [Ebe73]. However, our proof is
(almost) self-contained.

There is a direct link between the Θ function and Jacobi ﬁelds. Let us ﬁx for the moment
a geodesic γ(t), starting at x, of the form expx(tu). Then we choose a direct orthonormal
basis in TxN , whose last vector is u. Using parallel transport, this deﬁnes a family of parallel
direct orthonormal frames along γ, and we can express Jacobi ﬁelds in those frames. They
are found to satisfy the usual matrix equation:
(∗)
where K(t)X(t) = Rγ(t)(X(t), ˙γ(t)) ˙γ(t), R being the curvature tensor of N . In particular, K
is a symmetric matrix, and K(t) ˙γ = 0, so K(t) preserves the orthogonal of ˙γ. Hence we can
decompose the Jacobi ﬁelds into a parallel part c(t) ˙γ(t), and an orthogonal part. The parallel
coeﬃcient c(t) is of the form at + b.

X ′′(t) + K(t)X(t) = 0

In these coordinates, the matrix for Ttu expx is t−1A(t) where A(t) is the Jacobi matrix
ﬁeld such that A(0) = 0 and A′(0) = 1. If we decompose this into parallel and orthogonal
ﬁelds, the parallel part is of course 1, so we can abuse notations, and still denote by A(t) the
orthogonal ﬁeld. In what follows, we will only deal with orthogonal ﬁelds.

With the notations above,

Θ(x, expx(tu)) =

det(A(t))

tn−1

.

4

YANNICK BONTHONNEAU

The condition that there are no conjugate points is equivalent to assuming that the ﬁeld A(t)
is invertible for t 6= 0, independently of the vector (x, u) (or equivalently, that for all x, expx
is a global diﬀeomorphism). We also have

ϑ(x, expx(tu)) = det A(t).
We will use the Ricatti equation associated to (∗), that is
(∗∗)
This is also a matrix-valued equation along γ(t), and it is satisﬁed for V’s of the form B′B−1,
where B is an invertible solution of (∗). The non-conjugacy assumption will imply the ex-
istence of solutions to (∗∗) on the interval [0, +∞), and this can be seen as the conceptual
argument behind the proof.

V′ + V2 + K = 0.

The following lemma is fundamental for our argument. It can be found in Green for surfaces
(see lemma 3 in [Gre58]), or in Eberlein in this level of generality (lemma 2.8 in [Ebe73]). It
is actually a generalization of a result on Sturm-Liouville equations, known at least since E.
Hopf. When we write an inequality between two matrices, they are assumed to be symmetric,
and it means that the corresponding inequality holds between the associated quadratic forms.

Lemma 2.1. Let V be a symmetric solution to the Ricatti equation (∗∗), deﬁned for all t > 0,
then |V| ≤ k coth kt as soon as K ≥ −k21 for all t > 0.
Before going any further, let us make two remarks
(1) It is useful to recall that if B and C are two solutions of (∗), their Wronskian is
W(B, C) = B∗C′ − B′∗C — here L∗ is the transpose of L. It is constant. In particular,
if W(B, B) = 0 and B is invertible, the associated solution B′B−1 of (∗∗) is symmetric.
(2) Let U = A′A−1. One can check that it is a symmetric solution to (∗∗). Additionally,
we ﬁnd

d
dt

ϑ(x, expx(tu)) = ϑ(x, expx(tu)) Tr U(t).

In particular, this implies the existence of a bound of the form |ϑ(t)|−1 = O(t1−n)eO(t),
where the constants are independent of x and u. This would probably be suﬃcient
to obtain lemma 1.2, but we will nonetheless go on with the proof of lemma 1.3.

2.1. Green’s method. In this section, we recall the proof of existence of Green’s bundles.
As a corollary of the proof, we ﬁnd a bound that is exactly what we need. Let us introduce
further notations. The vector (x, u) is still ﬁxed.

For t 6= 0, the ﬁeld Dt is the unique solution to (∗) such that Dt(0) = 1, and Dt(t) = 0. The
existence and unicity of such a ﬁeld is assured by the non-conjugacy assumption. Green’s
bundles are the subbundles X± in T SN such that X±(x,u) = {(ξ, D′
±∞(0)·ξ), ξ ∈ TxN}. Here
D±∞ is the limit of the ﬁelds Dt as t → ±∞. Let us recall the proof of existence of such
limits.

First, there is an explicit expression for Dt:

Dt(s) = A(s)Z t

s

A(ℓ)−1A(ℓ)−1∗dℓ.

This is valid when s and t have the same sign. Observe that, still if s and t have the same
sign,

A(ℓ)−1A(ℓ)−1∗dℓ.

s(0) =Z t

In particular, the matrices D′
s > 0 ﬁxed, the family t 7→ D′
It suﬃces to prove that it is bounded from above.

s(0) are symmetric, and as symmetric matrices, with
s(0) is increasing. We want to show that it has a limit.

Since for any t > 0, A et Dt are two independent solutions of (∗), we can write

D−s = ANs,t + Dt

where Ns,t is a constant matrix. We ﬁnd

(3)

But we also have

−s(0) − D′
D′

t(0) = Ns,t.

Ns,t = −A(−s)−1Dt(−s)

This implies that Ns,t is symmetric positive deﬁnite for all s, t > 0. Indeed, N−t,t = 0, and
for s 6= 0,

d

(Ns,t − N∗

s,t) = A−1A−1∗(s)W(A, Dt) + W(Dt, A)A−1A−1∗(s) = 0.

This proves that Ns,t is symmetric for all s < 0. Now, examining s → 0, we ﬁnd that N − N∗
is continuous at s = 0, so that N ∗
s,t = Ns,t for all s. To check that N is positive deﬁnite, it
suﬃces to remark, as Green did, that for s > 0 small enough, it is true because Ns,t ∼ (1/s)1.
Next, for it to stop being true, the determinant would need to vanish at some s > 0. But
A(−s) and Dt(−s) are invertible for s > 0, so this is not possible.

As a consequence, for t > 0 and s > 0, according to (3),

and so for s > 0, and t > s,

D′
t(0) − D′

−s(0) ≤ 0

Letting t go to +∞, we ﬁnd:
M (s) := lim

2.2. End of the proof. From formula (4), we deduce that D+∞(s) is invertible for every
D−1
s ≥ 0. Hence the associated solution of (∗∗) V = D′
+∞ is deﬁned at least for all s ≥ 0.
It is also symmetric. Indeed, for any t, we have W(Dt, Dt) = 0 by evaluation at t. Letting
t → +∞, we get W(D+∞, D+∞) = 0.

+∞

Now, we want to apply lemma 2.1 on solutions of (∗∗). We consider

In particular,

As M (s) is symmetric, positive deﬁnite, M −1(s) ≥ 1/kM (s)k2, and

U(t) − V(t) = A(t)−1∗M (t)−1A(t)−1.

(cid:12)(cid:12)A(t)−1∗M (t)−1A(t)−1(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ 2k coth kt.

2kM (t)k2k coth kt ≥ A(t)−1∗A(t)−1

As a consequence,

2 ≤ 2kM (t)k2k coth kt
We ﬁnally get the result of this computation: for t > s > 0,
−s(0) − D′

kA−1(t)k2

s(0)k2

and according to Hadamard’s inequality,

kA(t)−1k2
2 ≤ 2k coth ktkD′
ϑ−1(t) ≤(cid:8)2k coth ktkD′

−s(0) − D′

s(0)k2(cid:9) n−1

Now, the last step of the proof is

Lemma 2.2. The quantity kD′
s(0)k2 is bounded independently of x and u, provided
that s > 0 is small enough. For this, it suﬃces to assume that the sectional curvature of
(N, g) is bounded.

−s(0) − D′

Proof. Let us ﬁx a vector (x, u) ∈ SN . Let J1 and J2 be the two Jacobi matrix ﬁelds along
{expx(tu)} such that

J1(0) = 1, J′

1(0) = 0, J2(0) = 0, J′

2(0) = 1.

One can check that for s 6= 0, D′

s(0) = −J2(s)−1J1(s). Whence we deduce that as s → 0,

D′
s(0) = −

1 + O(s).

s

To prove the lemma, it suﬃces to prove that the constant in O(s) can be controlled by the
sectional curvature. Let kmax be the supremum of kKx,u(t)k for all x, u, t. This is actually
the supremum of the absolute value of the sectional curvature of N .

Recall from the proof of the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem that the Jacobi ﬁelds J1 and J2

are obtained, at least for small times, as ﬁxed point of contraction mappings, respectively
