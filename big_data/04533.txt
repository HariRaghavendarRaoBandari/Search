High star formation rates in turbulent atomic-dominated gas in

the interacting galaxies IC 2163 and NGC 2207

ABSTRACT

CO observations of the interacting galaxies IC 2163 and NGC 2207 are com-
bined with HI, Hα and 24 µm to study the star formation rate (SFR) surface
density as a function of the gas surface density. More than half of the high SFR
regions are HI dominated. When compared to other galaxies, these HI-dominated
regions have excess SFRs relative to their molecular gas surface densities but nor-
mal SFRs relative to their total gas surface densities. The HI-dominated regions
are mostly located in the outer part of NGC 2207, where the HI velocity disper-
sion is high, 40 - 50 km s−1. We suggest that the star-forming clouds in these
regions have envelopes at lower densities than normal, making them predomi-
nantly atomic, and cores at higher densities than normal because of the high
turbulent Mach numbers. This is consistent with theoretical predictions of a
ﬂattening in the density probability distribution function for compressive, high
Mach number turbulence.

Introduction

The galaxies IC 2163 and NGC 2207 are undergoing a grazing collision with perigalac-
ticon ∼ 240 Myr ago (Struck et al. 2005). The tidal force exerted on IC 2163 by NGC 2207
is prograde and nearly in-plane. It produces an intrinsically ocular structure (a cuspy oval)
at mid-radius in IC 2163 and two tidal arms. A narrow ridge along the ocular appears to be
a galactic-scale shock front with intense star formation, several super-star clusters including
one measuring 2 × 105 M⊙ (Elmegreen et al. 2001), and an IR-to-radio continuum ratio (S[8
µm]/S[6 cm]) that is a factor of 2 higher than elsewhere in the galaxies (Kaufman et al.
2012). HI observations (Elmegreen et al. 1995a) reveal photometric and kinematic major
axes in IC 2163 that are nearly orthogonal, indicating high speed streaming motions. The
tidal force exerted on NGC 2207 by IC 2163 is mostly perpendicular to NGC 2207, causing
a velocity perturbation in NGC 2207 that is ∼ 200 km s−1 in places, and suggesting a warp
with 15 kpc vertical distortion (Elmegreen et al. 1995b).

Both galaxies have large HI velocity dispersions of ∼ 30 − 50 km s−1, and several large
HI cloud complexes with masses of 108 M⊙ or more (Elmegreen et al. 1993, 1995a). IC 2163
has an HI tidal bridge behind the eastern half of NGC 2207, and NGC 2207 has an HI spiral
arm (visible also optically) in front of IC 2163 (see Figures in Elmegreen et al. 2000, where
the HI contours are overlaid on an HST image).

NGC 2207 contains a peculiar region, Feature i, called a mini-starburst by Kaufman et al.
(2012). This is the brightest source for either galaxy in radio continuum, 8 µm, 24 µm and
Hα; it accounts for one-quarter of the total 24 µm ﬂux for both galaxies combined. At λ 6
cm, the radio continuum luminosity of Feature i is 13% of the radio continuum luminosity
of the central starburst in M82. Soft X-ray emission was found by Mineo et al. (2014).

We observed NGC 2207/IC 2163 in CO(1-0) with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array
(ALMA). The present paper is devoted to determining the spatially-resolved Kennicutt-
Schmidt (Kennicutt & Evans 2012) relation in this galaxy pair. We are interested in whether
this relation on a scale of 2.4 kpc diameter diﬀers from that in other galaxies, and whether it
is the same in both galaxies here. We combine the ALMA CO observations with our previous
HI, 24 µm, and Hα data to determine the star formation rate (SFR) surface density, ΣSFR,
as a function of atomic, molecular, and total gas surface densities. Other properties of these
CO observations will be discussed in Kaufman et al. (2016).

In what follows, Section 2 describes the observations, Section 3 gives the luminosities,
SFRs, and surface densities of the selected regions, Section 4 shows the relations between
ΣSFR and the gas surface density, and Section 5 discusses the implications.

2. Observations

IC 2163 and NGC 2207 were observed in 34 pointings using ALMA at the 12CO(1-0)
frequency of 115.27 GHz (λ 2.6 mm). We made naturally weighted maps of CO emission with
a point spread function of 2.00′′ × 1.52′′ (HPBW), beam position angle 68.5◦, and channel
width 10 km s−1. The rms noise per channel is 3.7 mJy beam−1 and a CO surface brightness
of 1 Jy beam−1 corresponds to Tb = 30.7 K. To select areas of genuine CO emission, we
made a blanking mask by convolving this cube to 6′′ × 6′′ HPBW, where the noise was 7.9
mJy/beam. Regions were left unblanked if they exceeded 2.5 times this rms noise for at
least 2 adjacent channels in an area of at least 1 arc sec. This means that regions with
line-of-sight N(H2) < 2.45 M⊙ pc−2 were blanked out. After correcting for primary beam
attenuation, we made the 551 × 301 pixel ×64 channel subcube used in this paper that
contains all of the unblanked CO emission. In the subcube, the product of the rms noise
and the channel width is equivalent to a line of sight N(H2) = 3.27 M⊙ pc−2, which is a
measure of our uncertainty. (The apertures A10, A16, A33, A38, and A39 discussed below
have mean values of line-of-sight N(H2) below this because of blanked pixels.) The total
integrated CO line ﬂux in the subcube is S(CO) = 505 Jy km s−1. For more details on the
observing procedure, see Kaufman et al. (2016).

To convert CO emission into molecular mass M(H2), we use XCO = 1.8 ± 0.3 × 1020
H2 cm−2 (K km s−1)−1 from Dame et al. (2001) and a distance D = 35 ± 2.5 Mpc from the
NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) for a Hubble constant of H = 73 km s−1 Mpc−1
corrected for infall towards Virgo. The scale is 170 pc per arcsec. To convert surface density
to face-on, we took inclinations of i = 40◦ for IC 2163 and 35◦ for NGC 2207 (Elmegreen et al.
1995b). We discuss the implications of diﬀerent XCO and i in Section 4.

The 24 µm ﬂux density, Sν(24µm), of Feature i and the galaxies as a whole were mea-
sured from the MIPS 1 pBCD image obtained from the Spitzer archive in 2013; the resolution
is 6′′. Other star-forming regions were measured on the HiRes deconvolution image (∼ 1.9′′
resolution) by Velusamy et al. (2008), who provided their HiRes 24 µm data to us as a FITS
image 1. According to Velusamy et al., the HiRes deconvolution conserves ﬂuxes of point
sources to better than 5%. This uncertainty is in addition to the 5% uncertainty in the

1MIPS 1 BCD images from Spitzer prior to April 2007 suﬀer from two software bugs which cause the
brightness of sources as bright as Feature i to be underestimated. We compared our Spitzer 24 µm MIPS 1
pBCD (level 2) image retrieved from the Spitzer archive in 2013 with the MIPS 1 image in Elmegreen et al.
(2006). We found that Feature i was the only source in NGC 2207/IC 2163 aﬀected by the software bug,
and that its ﬂux density is a factor of 1.9 times greater than in Elmegreen et al. (2006) and Kaufman et al.
(2012). Thus Feature i accounts for 23%, rather than 12%, of the 24 µm ﬂux density from the galaxy pair.
We use the corrected ﬂux here.

MIPS 1 photometric calibration. The HiRes deconvolution has about the same resolution
as our CO data. This high resolution minimizes line-of-sight corrections for diﬀuse emission
at 24 µm that is not coincident with the star-forming region (Leroy et al. 2012). The abso-
lute calibration of the 24 µm term in the SFR leads to an uncertainty of about 25% in the
absolute determination of the SFR (Leroy et al. 2012).

The HI is from VLA observations obtained in 1990 using a hybrid CnB array with an
extended north arm to compensate for the low latitude of the source. The duration on source
was 6 hours (for more details, see Elmegreen et al. 1995a). The map representing column
density, N(HI), comes from an HI cube with a channel width of 21 km s−1, rms noise 0.73
mJy beam−1, and FWHM of the point spread function equal to 13.5′′ × 12′′. The product
of the rms noise times the channel width is equivalent to a line-of-sight N(HI) = 0.84 M⊙
pc−2. Before creating the HI column density map, the HI data cube was masked in a similar
manner to the CO data described above; none of our apertures contain blanks in HI.

The Hα data stem from narrowband Hα images and broadband R images obtained by
Deidre Hunter with the Lowell 1.1m telescope in 1999 (Elmegreen et al. 2001). Four Hα
images were combined for a total time of 3600 s, and three R band images were combined for
a total of 900 s. The narrow ﬁlter excludes the redshifted [NII] line at 6583 ˚A, but includes
the 6548 ˚A line, which may contribute as much as 15% of the light for solar metallicity.
Considering equation 1 below, a systematic 15% decrease in the Hα ﬂux after removal of
[NII] amounts to an average decrease in ΣSFR of 5%.

Figure 1 displays the chosen regions as circular apertures overlaid on the CO integrated
intensity image, the HiRes 24 µm image, and the Hα image, which has a point spread
function of 4.2′′ × 3.6′′. The apertures were selected to have minimal overlap and to enclose
regions with prominent 24 µm, Hα, CO and/or HI emission. They include three of the
massive HI clouds in IC 2163 (I2, I3, I5) and four in NGC 2207 (N2, N3, N4, N6), even
though some have little star formation. Figure 2 shows the HI contours on CO for IC 2163
(top) and NGC 2207 (bottom), where the separate HI contributions from each galaxy were
determined from the line kinematics. For IC 2163 the lowest contour level is 5 M⊙ pc−2,
which is equivalent to three times the rms noise over 2 channel widths. For NGC 2207 we
omitted this contour level for clarity.

Table 1 compares global values of M(H2), M(HI), the 24 µm ﬂux density, Sν(24µm),
and the Hα ﬂux, S(Hα), for the ﬁelds displayed in Figure 1. For the values of M(H2),
Sν(24µm), and S(Hα), we chose a right ascension of 06h16m25.60s as the dividing line
between IC 2163 and NGC 2207. For M(HI), we included the tidal bridge of IC 2163
behind NGC 2207 and the spiral arm of NGC 2207 in front of IC 2163. The values listed
under M(HI) (total) include the HI emission outside the ﬁeld in Figure 1; the values listed

– 5 –

under M(HI) (CO ﬁeld) are only for the ﬁeld in that ﬁgure. For IC 2163, the value of
Sν(24µm) measured on the HiRes image is 84% of that measured on the MIPS 1 pBCD
image (the HiRes image is less sensitive to faint extended emission).

Table 1 indicates that IC 2163 has a total molecular mass M(H2) = 2.1 × 109 M⊙,
which corresponds to an integrated CO line ﬂux of 240 Jy km s−1, and NGC 2207 has
M(H2) = 2.3 × 109 M⊙ for a CO line ﬂux of 265 Jy km s−1. If we restrict the HI to the ﬁeld
of Figure 1, then the global ratio of molecular to atomic gas is 4 times greater in IC 2163
than in NGC 2207. For most of the 15 apertures in IC 2163 (except those on the massive HI
clouds), the column density N(H2) dominates N(HI), while for most of the 29 apertures in
NGC 2207, N(HI) > N(H2). Thus, the eyelid shock in IC 2163 is currently more eﬀective
than the spiral arms of NGC 2207 in converting HI to H2. Also, the global ratio of M(H2) to
24 µm ﬂux density is ∼ 2 times greater in IC 2163 than in NGC 2207, and the global ratio
of M(H2) to Hα ﬂux is ∼ 3 times greater in IC 2163 than in NGC 2207. These molecular
excesses compared to star formation in IC 2163 are not as large as the molecular excesses
compared to atomic gas as traced by HI. This diﬀerence suggests that the encounter has
converted a high fraction of HI into H2 in IC 2163 but has not (yet) converted the additional
molecules into stars.

3. Star formation rates

A combination of the continuum-subtracted Hα image (Elmegreen et al. 2001) and the
Spitzer MIPS 24 µm image was used to obtain the SFR, following Kennicutt et al. (2009),

SFR(M⊙ yr−1) = 5.5 × 10−42 (L[Hα] + 0.031L[24µm])

(1)

where L(Hα) and L(24µm) are in erg s−1, and L(24µm) = νLν. We chose source apertures
with a diameter of 14′′ = 2.4 kpc. This choice was governed by the HI resolution and by the
need to have a suﬃciently large aperture to avoid stochastic eﬀects from including too few
O stars when using Hα as a star-formation tracer.

For the 24 µm measurement of Feature i, we did a local background subtraction and
applied an aperture ﬂux correction factor of 1.61 from the MIPS Instrument Handbook2. It
was not necessary to remove background for the CO or HI sources, nor for the other HiRes
24 µm sources. For Hα, we did a global background subtraction but not a local subtraction
because there would be contamination from adjacent sources in many cases.

Foreground Galactic extinction AV = 0.238 mag from NED (using Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner
2011) gives an extinction at Hα equal to 0.238 mag/1.28 = 0.186 mag. In addition, IC 2163
is aﬀected by extinction from the foreground spiral arm of NGC 2207. Since the outer part
of NGC 2207 is likely to be metal poor, we take AV(mag) = (0.35 ± 0.18) × 10−21N(HI)
for this region (Elmegreen et al. 2001). This additional extinction is applied to 8 of the 15
regions in IC 2163. These 8 have the highest foreground N(HI) and the largest corrections
(AV(Hα) > 0.45 mag), with an average AV(Hα) = 0.85 ± 0.4 mag from the foreground HI
in NGC 2207. We assume that Hα and 24 µm emission from the foreground part of NGC
2207 are negligible.

Table 2 compiles the locations, luminosities, SFRs, ΣSFR, and surface densities for H2
and HI in all of the chosen apertures. The regions associated with massive HI clouds are
indicated by the footnote h. The SFR is lower than 0.001 in the massive HI cloud apertures
A10 and A33. This is below the limit suggested by Leroy et al. (2012) where the SFR can
be reliably determined using the above method; the actual values do not contribute to the
conclusions of this paper.

4. Star formation - surface density correlation

The conventional way to consider star formation on galactic scales is in terms of the
correlation between ΣSFR and gas surface density (the “Kennicutt-Schmidt” relation), either
for HI (ΣHI), H2 (ΣH2), or the sum of these (Kennicutt & Evans 2012).

Figure 3 shows these correlations. Figure 3(a) has the total gas relation, Figure 3(b) has
H2 alone, 3(c) has HI alone, and 3(d) shows ΣSFR versus ΣH2/ΣHI, the molecular ratio. Figure
3(d) is divided into three parts: where ΣSFR > 0.01, the green points are for a molecular ratio
less then 1 and the red points are for a molecular ratio greater than 1. Where ΣSFR < 0.01,
the blue points are plotted for all molecular ratios. These colors have the same meaning in
the other panels.

First consider the molecular relation in Figure 3(b). In the THINGS survey (Bigiel et al.
2008; Leroy et al. 2008), this was linear with a constant consumption time per CO molecule
of 1-2 Gyr. This is the case here too, but only for the red and blue points, i.e., for the
molecular-dominated gas at high SFR and all of the gas at low SFR. The HI-dominated
gas at high SFR (green points) lies high oﬀ the linear molecular relation. The scatter in
the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt relation in Bigiel et al. (2008) is ±0.2 dex for ΣSFR, which
is three times smaller than the displacement of the green points from the red+blue point
correlation in Figure 3(b). The H2 consumption time for the HI-dominated gas is ∼ 300

– 7 –

Myr, which is relatively fast compared to the time for the H2-dominated gas. The red circles
around the points are for locations in the ocular rim of IC 2163.

The total-gas relation in Figure 3(a) has a consumption time for total gas of about 1
Gyr in regions with high SFRs (green and red points). This time is normal for molecular
gas, but here it includes HI and also applies in HI-dominated regions (green points). The
blue points (low SFR) have longer total-gas consumption times, between ∼ 3 and 10 Gyr.

In Figure 3(c), the molecular-dominated regions (red points) have relatively low HI
and the HI-dominated regions (green points) have relatively high HI. The values for the HI
surface density in the HI-dominated, high SFR regions are unusually high: ΣHI is greater
than 20 M⊙ pc−2 in many cases, which is twice as large as the saturated value of HI in the
THINGS survey (Bigiel et al. 2008; Leroy et al. 2008).

What is peculiar about these relationships is the HI. If we ignore the HI-rich, high
SFR regions (green points), then the molecular relation in Figure 3(b) is normal; the nearly
constant ΣHI up to ∼ 10 M⊙ pc−2 for the high-SFR regions (red points) in Figure 3(c) is
normal, and the steady increase in ΣSFR with molecular fraction in Figure 3(d) is normal. In
these galaxies, however, there is a component of high HI column density gas where the SFR
is high also. The HI is replacing some fraction of the molecules, giving a linear relation when
the SFR is plotted against the total gas (Fig. 3(a)). Similarly, the HI-dominated regions
lie oﬀ the normal linear law when the SFR is plotted versus only the molecular part of the
gas (Fig. 3(b)). We also note that the molecular ratio ΣH2/ΣHI increases with decreasing
L(Hα)/[0.031L(24µm)] (not shown) suggesting more optical extinction in the star-forming
cores when the molecular content is high.

Figure 4 shows the locations of these three types of regions on the sky using the same
color scheme as in Figure 3. The HI-rich regions of high ΣSFR are on the periphery of the
galaxy that underwent the retrograde, perpendicular encounter (NGC 2207) and are globally
coincident with the areas of high HI velocity dispersion in that galaxy (see Elmegreen et al.
1995a). The H2-rich regions of high ΣSFR are mainly in the ocular ridge of IC 2163 where
in-plane tidal forces produced a compression. The low ΣSFR regions are scattered across
both galaxies.

Feature i in each panel (denoted by “i”) has ΣSFR at least a factor of 5 higher than in any
other region. The molecular mass of Feature i is 8 × 107 M⊙, which is not unusual for these
2.4 kpc diameter apertures. In IC 2163, 11 of the 15 apertures have molecular masses greater
than this (Table 2), and the mass in region A9 is 2.5 times greater. However, because of the
high SFR, the molecular gas consumption time for Feature i, ΣH2/ΣSFR = 50 Myr, is much
shorter than for the other regions, and the total gas consumption time, (ΣHI + ΣH2)/ΣSFR =

– 8 –

118 Myr, is shorter too, as indicated by the positions of Feature i relative to the dashed red
lines in Figures 3(b) and (a), respectively.

A lower XCO as suggested for some interacting galaxies and in Bournaud et al. (2015)
would decrease the H2 mass and strengthen the conclusion that there are HI-rich star-forming
regions with peculiar cloud structure. A higher XCO would bring the H2 content of these
regions in line with the CO-bright regions, but then XCO would have to vary from cloud
to cloud and be high primarily in the outer parts of NGC 2207, where the peculiar HI gas
is. These outer parts are not so remote that low metallicities and an associated high XCO
are expected. Higher XCO is also unlikely because the high velocity dispersion should lower
the CO opacity by broadening the line, producing more CO emission per unit H2 molecule
(Bournaud et al. 2015). Inclination eﬀects would not seem to be causing the peculiar HI
either. The suspected warp in NGC 2207 occurs about where this HI is, but correcting
for that by lengthening the line-of-sight for gas emission only strengthens the conclusions
because it lowers the average density for the observed column of HI and makes star formation
slower, when in fact it is faster than normal. Changing the inclination slides points parallel
to the lines of constant gas consumption time in the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation because it
aﬀects the deprojected areas used for the ordinate and abscissa equally.

A second version of Figure 4 was made (not shown) with all of the images convolved to
14′′ × 14′′ resolution before the measurements were made inside the same apertures. This
change had the eﬀect of decreasing the ﬂuxes used for the SFRs and ΣH2 by factors between
0.5 and 0.9, and that moved the points in the ﬁgure slightly down and to the left in a
direction nearly parallel to the lines of constant consumption time. Considering the wings
of the Gaussian, this is the expected reduction factor for a small source located somewhere
in the aperture when the aperture diameter is the same as the FWHM of the point spread
function in the convolved image. None of the conclusions of this paper were aﬀected by this
change.

5. Discussion

HI-dominated regions with high SFRs are unusual and could be related to the high tur-
bulent speeds in this interacting pair. The mean HI velocity dispersion for the 16 green circles
in N2207 (Fig. 4) is 42 km s−1, compared to ∼ 10 km s−1 in normal galaxies (Tamburro et al.
2009). An interaction perturbs the smooth circular ﬂow of gas and causes deﬂected streams
to intersect each other at high speeds, producing shocks and a turbulent cascade. Numeri-
cal simulations show this eﬀect (Wetzstein et al. 2007; Bournaud et al. 2011a; Powell et al.
2013). Some turbulent energy in NGC 2207 may also come from excited vertical motions.

– 9 –

High velocity dispersions in interacting systems were also reported by Kaufman et al. (1999),
Rich et al. (2015) and others. In comparison, the THINGS galaxies and most others used
for the conventional SFR-gas correlations are not interacting.

Stronger shocks imply a greater compressive component to the turbulence, as opposed
to a normally dominant rotational component (Federrath et al. 2008, 2010). Tidal forces
can increase the compressive mode too (Renaud et al. 2014). As a result, the probability
distribution function for density ﬂattens from an approximately log-normal (Nolan et al.
2015) shape to a broad distribution where a large amount of low-density atomic gas co-exists
with a large amount of high-density star-forming gas (Federrath 2013; Federrath & Klessen
2013; Bournaud et al. 2011b; Renaud et al. 2012). The star formation rate may scale with
the mass of the high density gas as usual (e.g., Evans et al. 2014; Clark & Glover 2014).
Physically, this implies a change in the structure of clouds toward more extended HI envelopes
around denser H2 and CO cores.

The molecular envelop traced by CO in a self-gravitating cloud usually contributes to
the gas surface density in the molecular star formation law. Here, the envelopes may be
puﬀed up with high velocity dispersions, giving them low densities and a transparency that
keeps them predominantly atomic. Then the envelopes act physically like the CO envelopes
of star-forming clouds in non-interacting galaxies, but produce a star formation law with a
signiﬁcant amount of HI and dark H2 substituted for CO-bright gas.

Another possibility for the HI-rich regions of high SFR is that there is large-scale syn-
chronization of star formation in NGC 2207, starting at perigalacticon ∼ 240 Myr ago,
whereby many of the giant molecular clouds formed in the outer parts have just now dis-
persed into HI before their OB associations have signiﬁcantly faded.

aThe units are as follows: R.A. in seconds, Dec. in arcminutes and arcseconds; L(24 µm)
and L(Hα) in 1040 erg s−1; SFR in M⊙ yr−1; ΣSFR in M⊙ pc−2 Myr−1; ΣH2 and ΣHI in
M⊙ pc−2.

bL(24µm) is νLν at 24 µm.

cL(Hα) is corrected for Galactic foreground extinction using AV/1.28 = 0.186 mag.
L(Hα) for apertures A3, A4, A5, A6, A12, A13, A14, and A15 have also been corrected
for foreground extinction by the outer arm of NGC 2207 in front of IC 2163. The latter
correction (see text) amounts to an average of 0.85 ± 0.43 mag at Hα.

dSFR(M⊙ yr−1) = 5.5 × 10−42[L(Hα) + 0.031L(24µ m)] (erg s−1).

eSurface densities have been corrected to face-on using i = 40◦ for IC 2163 and i = 35◦

for NGC 2207.

f Feature i

gApertures are 14′′ in diameter.

hIn IC 2163, apertures A1 and A2 are on parts of the massive HI cloud I3, A7 is on I2,
and A10 and A11 are on parts of I5. In NGC 2207, apertures A17, A33, A36, and A38 are
on massive HI clouds N6, N2, N3, and N4, respectively.

Fig. 3.— The SFR surface density is plotted versus the gas surface density in various forms.
Color indicates regions with high SFR (green for low molecular fraction and red for high
molecular fraction) and low SFR (blue), as indicated in panel (d). Feature i is labeled. The
red circles in (b) are for locations in the ocular rim of IC 2163. The red dashed lines in (a)
and (b) indicate gas consumption times. The dashed lines in (d) separate regions of high
and low SFR and high and low ΣH2/ΣHI ratio.
