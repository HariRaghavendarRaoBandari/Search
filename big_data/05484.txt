Coupling by reﬂection mixed with synchronous coupling is constructed for a class of stochas-
tic diﬀerential equations (SDEs) driven by L´evy noises. As an application, we establish the
exponential contractivity of the associated semigroups (Pt)t≥0 with respect to the standard
Lp-Wasserstein distance for all p ∈ [1, ∞). In particular, consider the following SDE:

where (Zt)t≥0 is a symmetric α-stable process on Rd with α ∈ (1, 2). We show that if the drift
term b satisﬁes that for any x, y ∈ Rd,

dXt = dZt + b(Xt) dt,

hb(x) − b(y), x − yi ≤(cid:26) K1|x − y|2,

−K2|x − y|θ,

|x − y| ≤ L0;

|x − y| > L0

holds with some positive constants K1, K2, L0 > 0 and θ ≥ 2, then there is a constant λ :=
λ(θ, K1, K2, L0) > 0 such that for all p ∈ [1, ∞), t > 0 and x, y ∈ Rd,

Wp(δxPt, δyPt) ≤ C(p, θ, K1, K2, L0)e−λt/p(cid:20)

|x − y|1/p ∨ |x − y|

1. Introduction

In this paper, we consider the following stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE) driven by
L´evy noises:

where (Zt)t≥0 is a d-dimensional L´evy process, and b : Rd → Rd is a continuous vector
ﬁeld such that for any x, y ∈ Rd,

dXt = dZt + b(Xt) dt,

holds for some constant C > 0. It is a standard result that in this case the SDE (1.1)
enjoys the unique strong solution.

Denote by (Pt)t≥0 the semigroup associated to (1.1). If the initial value X0 is dis-
tributed as µ, then for any t > 0, the distribution of Xt is µPt. We are concerned with
the exponential contractivity of the map µ 7→ µPt with respect to the standard Lp-
Wasserstein distance Wp for all p ≥ 1. Given two probability measures µ and ν on Rd,
the standard Lp-Wasserstein distance Wp for all p ∈ [1, ∞) (with respect to the Euclidean
norm | · |) is given by

Wp(µ, ν) = inf

Π∈C(µ,ν)(cid:18)ZRd×Rd

|x − y|p dΠ(x, y)(cid:19)1/p

.

Equipped with Wp, the totality Pp(Rd) of probability measures having ﬁnite moment of
order p becomes a complete metric space.

The following result is well known.

Theorem 1.1. Suppose that there exists a constant K > 0 such that

hb(x) − b(y), x − yi ≤ −K|x − y|2

for all x, y ∈ Rd.

Then, for any p ≥ 1 and t > 0,

Wp(µPt, νPt) ≤ e−KtWp(µ, ν)

for all µ, ν ∈ Pp(Rd).

(1.2)

(1.3)

The proof of this result is quite straightforward, by simply using the synchronous
coupling, which is also called the basic coupling or the coupling of marching soldiers in
the literature (see, e.g., [8], Deﬁnition 2.4 and [7], Example 2.16). The reader can refer
to [3], page 2432, the proof of Theorem 1.1 for the case of diﬀusion processes. (1.2) is
the so-called uniformly dissipative condition, which seems to be a limit in applications.
For diﬀusion processes, it follows from [21], Theorem 1, or [3], Remark 3.6 (also see [5],
Theorem 3.6) that (1.3) holds for any probability measures µ and ν if and only if (1.2)
holds for all x, y ∈ Rd. The ﬁrst breakthrough to get rid of such restrictive condition in
this direction for L1-Wasserstein distance W1 was done recently by Eberle in [10, 11],
at the price of multiplying a constant C ≥ 1 on the right-hand side of (1.3). See [10],
Corollary 2.3, for more details, and [15], Theorem 1.3, for related developments on Lp-
Wasserstein distance Wp with all p ∈ [1, ∞) on this topic. However, the corresponding
result for SDEs driven by L´evy noises is not available yet now. Indeed, we will see later
that in this case we need a completely diﬀerent idea for the construction of the coupling
processes, and a new approach by using the coupling argument, in particular the more
delicate choice of auxiliary functions.

Throughout this paper, we assume that the driving L´evy process has a symmetric α-
stable process as a component. That is, let ν be the L´evy measure of the process (Zt)t≥0,
then

ν(dz) ≥

Cd,α
|z|d+α dz,

Lp-Wasserstein distance for stochastic diﬀerential equations driven by L´evy processes 3

where Cd,α = 2αΓ((d + α)/2)π−d/2|Γ(−α/2)|−1 is a constant associated with the L´evy
measure of a symmetric α-stable process or fractional Laplacian, that is,

−(−∆)α/2f (x) =Z (f (x + z) − f (x) − h∇f (x), zi1{|z|≤1})

Cd,α
|z|d+α dz.

Denote by ωd = 2πd/2/Γ(d/2) the surface measure of the unit sphere in Rd. Our main
contribution of this paper is as follows.

Theorem 1.2. Assume that for any x, y ∈ Rd,

hb(x) − b(y), x − yi ≤(cid:26) K1|x − y|2,

−K2|x − y|θ,

|x − y| ≤ L0;
|x − y| > L0

(1.4)

holds with some positive constants K1, K2, L0 > 0 and θ ≥ 2. Then for all α ∈ (1, 2) or
for all α ∈ (0, 1] with

αCd,αωd3α−1

8(2 − α)d

> K1Lα
0 ,

(1.5)

there exists a positive constant λ := λ(θ, K1, K2, L0) > 0, such that for any p ≥ 1 the
following two statements hold:

(i) if θ = 2, then for all x, y ∈ Rd and any t > 0,

Wp(δxPt, δyPt) ≤ Ce−λt/p(|x − y|1/p ∨ |x − y|);

(ii) if θ > 2, then for all x, y ∈ Rd and any t > 0,

Wp(δxPt, δyPt) ≤ Ce−λt/p(cid:20) |x − y|1/p ∨ |x − y|
1 + |x − y|1(1,∞)(t)(cid:21),

where C > 0 is a positive constant depending on θ, K1, K2, L0 and p.

(1.6)

(1.7)

Theorem 1.2 above does provide new conditions on the drift term b such that the asso-
ciated semigroup (Pt)t≥0 is exponentially contractive with respect to the Lp-Wasserstein
distance Wp for all p ≥ 1. In particular, when α ∈ (1, 2), the conclusion of Theorem 1.2
is the same as that of [15], Theorem 1.3, for diﬀusion processes; while for α ∈ (0, 1] we
need the restrictive condition (1.5); see Remark 3.3 for a further comment. Indeed, (1.5)
is natural in the sense that, when α ∈ (0, 1] the drift term plays the dominant role or
the same role (just in case that α = 1) for the behavior of SDEs driven by symmetric
α-stable processes, see, for example, [2, 9] for (Dirichlet) heat kernel estimates and [24]
for dimensional free Harnack inequalities on this topic. Similarly, in considering the ex-
ponential contractivity of SDE (1.1), we need (1.5) to control the locally non-dissipative
part of the drift term. Note that (1.5) holds true when K1, L0 are small enough.

To show the power of Theorem 1.2, we consider the following example about the SDE
driven by symmetric α-stable processes with α ∈ (0, 2), which yields the exponential

contractivity of the semigroup (Pt)t≥0 with respect to the Lp-Wasserstein distance Wp
(p ≥ 1) for super-convex potentials.

Example 1.3. Let (Zt)t≥0 be a symmetric α-stable process in Rd with α ∈ (0, 2), and
b(x) = ∇V (x) with V (x) = −|x|2β and β > 1. Then there exists a constant λ := λ(α, β) >
0 such that for all p ≥ 1, x, y ∈ Rd and t > 0,

Wp(δxPt, δyPt) ≤ C(α, β, p)e−λt/p(cid:20) |x − y|1/p ∨ |x − y|
1 + |x − y|1(1,∞)(t)(cid:21).

Note that the uniformly dissipative condition (1.2) fails for Example 1.3; see, for exam-
ple, (3.8) below. That is, one cannot deduce directly from Theorem 1.1 the exponential
contractivity with respect to the Lp-Wasserstein distance Wp for all p ∈ [1, ∞).

The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. In the next section, we will present
the coupling by reﬂection mixed with the synchronous coupling for the SDE (1.1) driven
by L´evy noise, and also prove the existence of coupling process associated with this
coupling (operator). Section 3 is mainly devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.2. For this, we
need more delicate choice of auxiliary functions and some key estimates for them, which
are diﬀerent between α ∈ (1, 2) and α ∈ (0, 1]. The sketch of the proof of Example 1.3 is
also given here.

2. Coupling operator and coupling process for SDEs

with jumps

2.1. Coupling by reﬂection and synchronous coupling

It is easy to see that the generator of the process (Xt)t≥0 acting on C2

b (Rd) is

Lf (x) =Z (f (x + z) − f (x) − h∇f (x), zi1{|z|≤1})ν(dz) + hb(x), ∇f (x)i.

(2.1)

In this part, we construct a coupling operator for the generator L above. For any x, y
and z ∈ Rd, we set

ϕx,y(z) :=

2hx − y, zi
|x − y|2 (x − y),

z −

−z,

x 6= y;

x = y.

It is clear that ϕx,y : Rd → Rd has the following three properties:

(A1) ϕx,y(z) = ϕy,x(z) and ϕ2
(A2) |ϕx,y(z)| = |z|;
(A3) (z − ϕx,y(z)) // (x − y) and (z + ϕx,y(z)) ⊥ (x − y).

x,y(z) = z, that is, ϕ−1

x,y(z) = ϕx,y(z);

Next, for any f ∈ C2

b (R2d), let

∇xf (x, y) :=(cid:18) ∂f (x, y)

∂xi (cid:19)1≤i≤d

,

∇yf (x, y) :=(cid:18) ∂f (x, y)

∂yi (cid:19)1≤i≤d

.

Now, let L0 be the constant appearing in (1.4). We will split the construction of
the coupling operator into two parts, according to x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| ≤ L0 or with
|x − y| > L0. First, for any f ∈ C2

b (R2d) and x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| ≤ L0, we deﬁne

eLf (x, y) :=

(f (x + z, y + ϕx,y(z)) − f (x, y) − h∇xf (x, y), zi1{|z|≤1}

− h∇yf (x, y), ϕx,y(z)i1{|z|≤1})

− h∇xf (x, y), ϕx,y(z)i1{|z|≤1})

Cd,α

|z|d+α dz(cid:21)

(f (x + z, y + z) − f (x, y) − h∇xf (x, y), zi1{|z|≤1}

− h∇yf (x, y), zi1{|z|≤1})(cid:18)ν(dz) −

Cd,α

|z|d+α dz(cid:19)

(f (x + z, y + z) − f (x, y) − h∇xf (x, y), zi1{|z|≤1}

− h∇yf (x, y), zi1{|z|≤1})ν(dz)

+ h∇xf (x, y), b(x)i + h∇yf (x, y), b(y)i,

where a ∈ (0, 1/2) is a constant determined by later.

On the other hand, for any f ∈ C2

b (R2d) and x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| > L0, we deﬁne

eLf (x, y) :=Z (f (x + z, y + z) − f (x, y) − h∇xf (x, y), zi1{|z|≤1}

− h∇yf (x, y), zi1{|z|≤1})ν(dz)

+ h∇xf (x, y), b(x)i + h∇yf (x, y), b(y)i.

We can conclude the following.

Proposition 2.1. The operator eL deﬁned by above is the coupling operator of the oper-

ator L given by (2.1).

6

Proof. Since eL is a linear operator, it suﬃces to verify that

b (Rd),

f ∈ C2

eLf (x) = Lf (x),

where, on the left-hand side, f is regarded as a bivariate function on R2d, that is, f (x) =
f (x, y) for all x, y ∈ Rd.

For any x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| > L0, it is trivial to see that (2.2) holds true, and so we

only need to verify that for x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| ≤ L0. First, we have

(2.2)

eLf (x) =

+ hb(x), ∇f (x)i.

By (A1) and (A2), we know that the measure Cd,α
mation z 7→ ϕx,y(z). This, along with (A2) and the equality above, leads to

|z|d+α dz is invariant under the transfor-

eLf (x) =Z{|z|≤a|x−y|}

+Z{|z|>a|x−y|}

(f (x + z) − f (x) − h∇f (x), zi1{|z|≤1})

(f (x + z) − f (x) − h∇f (x), zi1{|z|≤1})ν(dz)

+ hb(x), ∇f (x)i

= Lf (x).

This completes the proof.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.2. (1) Here, we give an interpretation of the construction of the coupling

operator eL above. If |x − y| > L0, we use the synchronous coupling. If |x − y| ≤ L0,
then the coupling operator eL constructed above consists of two parts. Fix any x, y ∈

Rd. If |z| ≤ a|x − y|, then we adopt the coupling by reﬂection by making full use of
the rotationally invariant measure Cd,α
|z|d+α dz; while for the remainder term, we use the
synchronous coupling again, where the components maintain at each step the same length

Lp-Wasserstein distance for stochastic diﬀerential equations driven by L´evy processes 7

of jumps (i.e., from (x, y) to (x + z, y + z)) with the biggest rate ν(dz) when |z| > a|x − y|,
and with the rate ν(dz) − Cd,α
|z|d+α dz when |z| ≤ a|x − y|. For the coupling by reﬂection for
Brownian motion and diﬀusion processes, we refer to [6, 14, 22].

(2) Recently, the coupling property of L´evy processes has been developed in [4, 17, 18].
The corresponding property for Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes with jumps also has been
successfully studied in [19, 23]. Unlike L´evy processes and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes
with jumps, it is impossible to write out an explicit expression for transition functions
of the solution to the SDE (1.1) with general drift term b(x). This observation indicates
that all the approaches in [4, 17–19, 23] are not eﬃcient in the present setting. This
diﬃculty will be overcome by constructing proper coupling operators for the Markov
generator corresponding to the solution of the SDE (1.1), as done in [25]. However,
diﬀerent from [25] which deals with the corresponding coupling property by making full
use of large jumps part of L´evy processes, here to consider the exponential contractivity
of the associated semigroups (Pt)t≥0 with respect to Wasserstein distances we need a
new construction of the coupling operator. As seen from Propositions 3.1 and 3.2 below,
the coupling for small jumps part of L´evy processes [i.e., the coupling by reﬂection as
mentioned in (1)] is key for our purpose.

2.2. Coupling process

In this part, we will construct a coupling process associated with the coupling operator

eL. For this, we will frequently talk about the martingale problem for the operator L
given by (2.1) and the coupling operator eL. Let D([0, ∞); Rd) be the space of right

continuous Rd-valued functions having left limits on [0, ∞), equipped with the Skorokhod
topology. For t ≥ 0, denote by Xt the projection coordinate map on D([0, ∞); Rd). A
probability measure Px on the Skorokhod space D([0, ∞); Rd) is said to be a solution to
the martingale problem for (L, C2
c (Rd)) with initial value x ∈ Rd if Px(X0 = x) = 1 and
for every f ∈ C2

c (Rd)

(cid:26)f (Xt) − f (x) −Z t

Lf (Xs) ds, t ≥ 0(cid:27)

to the martingale problem for the coupling operator eL on C2

is a Px-martingale. The martingale problem for (L, C2
c (Rd)) is said to be well-posed if it
has a unique solution for every initial value x ∈ Rd. Similarly, we can deﬁne a solution
c (R2d). Note that, in [13] an
equivalence is proved between the existence of weak solutions to SDEs with jumps and
the existence of solutions to the corresponding martingale problem, by using a martingale
representation theorem. Recently, Kurtz [12] studied equivalence between the uniqueness
(in sense of distribution) of weak solutions to a class of SDEs driven by Poisson random
measures and the well-posed solution to martingale problems for a class of non-local
operators using a non-constructive approach. Note that in our setting the SDE (1.1)
has the pathwise unique strong solution. According to [1], Theorem 1, page 2, the weak
solution to the SDE (1.1) enjoys the unique (in sense of distribution) weak solution. This,

along with [12], Corollary 2.5, yields that the martingale problem for (L, C2

3.1. Key estimates

We ﬁrst assume that α ∈ (1, 2). For any r > 0, deﬁne

ψ(r) :=(cid:26) 1 − e−c1r,

Aec2(r−2L0) + B(r − 2L0)2 + (1 − e−2c1L0 − A),

r ∈ [0, 2L0];
r ∈ [2L0, ∞),

where

A =

c2 is a positive constant such that c2 ≥ 20c1, that is,

log

2(c1 + c2)

c2

≤ log 2.1,

and c1 is a positive constant determined by later. With the choice of the constants A
and B above, it is easy to see that ψ ∈ C2([0, ∞)). Then we have:

Proposition 3.1. Assume that α ∈ (1, 2). Then there exists a constant λ > 0 such that
for any x, y ∈ Rd,

Proof. (1) In this part, we treat the case that x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| ≤ L0. First, for any
x, y, z ∈ Rd, by (A3),

eLψ(|x − y|) ≤ −λψ(|x − y|).

and so

hx − y, z + ϕx,y(z)i = 0

h∇xψ(|x − y|), z + ϕx,y(z)i = 0 and h∇yψ(|x − y|), z + ϕx,y(z)i = 0.

It is easy to see that ψ ∈ C3([0, 2L0)) such that ψ′ > 0, ψ′′ < 0 and ψ′′′ > 0 on [0, 2L0).

Then, for any 0 ≤ δ < r ≤ L0,

ψ′′(u) du ≤ ψ′′(r + δ)δ2,

where in the inequality we have used the fact that ψ′′′ > 0 on [0, 2L0). Hence, according
to the deﬁnition of ϕx,y(z) and the inequality above, for all x, y, z ∈ Rd with |x − y| ≤ L0
and |z| ≤ a|x − y| with a ∈ (0, 1/2), we have

ψ(|x − y + (z − ϕx,y(z))|) + ψ(|x − y − (z − ϕx,y(z))|) − 2ψ(|x − y|)

(2) Second, we consider the case that x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| > L0. For any x, y ∈ Rd

with L0 < |x − y| ≤ 2L0, by (1.4) and the fact that ψ′ > 0,

On the other hand, also by (1.4) and the fact that ψ′ > 0, for any x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| ≥
2L0,

eLψ(|x − y|) ≤ −c1K2e−c1|x−y||x − y|θ−1 ≤ −c1K2Lθ−2
eLψ(|x − y|) ≤ −K2[Ac2ec2(|x−y|−2L0) + 2B(|x − y| − 2L0)]|x − y|θ−1.

Next, we consider the function

g(r) = 1

2 Ac2ec2(r−2L0) + 2B(r − 2L0)

on [2L0, ∞). It is easy to see that due to the deﬁnitions of the constants A and B, there
is a unique r1 ∈ [2L0, ∞) such that g′(r1) = 0 and

Since c2 > 0 is large enough such that

Lp-Wasserstein distance for stochastic diﬀerential equations driven by L´evy processes 13

we have g(r1) > 0, which implies that g(r) > 0 for all r ∈ [2L0, ∞). In particular,

1

2 Ac2ec2(|x−y|−2L0) + 2B(|x − y| − 2L0) ≥ 0

for any x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| ≥ 2L0. That is, for any x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| ≥ 2L0,

Combining both estimates above with the deﬁnition of ψ, we ﬁnally conclude that

there is a constant λ2 > 0 such that for any x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| > L0,

This along with the conclusion of part (1) yields the desired assertion.

eLψ(|x − y|) ≤ −λ2ψ(|x − y|).

(cid:3)

Next, we turn to the case of α ∈ (0, 1]. For this, we ﬁrst take the constant a = 1

4 in

which is diﬀerent from that in the case α ∈ (1, 2). For any r > 0, we deﬁne

the deﬁnition of the coupling operator eL, and then change the test function ψ as follows,
ψ(r) :=(cid:26) r − cr1+α,

Aec0(r−2L0) + B(r − 2L0)2 + (2L0 − c(2L0)1+α − A),

then there exists a constant λ > 0 such that for any x, y ∈ Rd with x 6= y,

eLψ(|x − y|) ≤ −λψ(|x − y|).

Since ψ ∈ C3((0, 2L0)) such that ψ′ > 0, ψ′′ < 0 and ψ′′′ > 0 on (0, 2L0), one can follow
the proof of (3.1), and get that for all x, y, z ∈ Rd with 0 < |x − y| ≤ L0 and |z| ≤ 1

Next, we turn to the case that x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| > L0. For any x, y ∈ Rd with

eLψ(|x − y|) ≤ −K2(1 − c(1 + α)|x − y|α)|x − y|θ−1

eLψ(|x − y|) ≤ −K2[Ac0ec0(|x−y|−2L0) + 2B(|x − y| − 2L0)]|x − y|θ−1.

Now, we consider again the function

g(r) = 1

2 Ac0ec0(r−2L0) + 2B(r − 2L0)

on [2L0, ∞). It is easy to see that due to the deﬁnitions of the constants A and B, there

Lp-Wasserstein distance for stochastic diﬀerential equations driven by L´evy processes 15

and so g(r1) > 0, which implies that g(r) > 0 for all r ∈ [2L0, ∞). In particular,

2 Ac0ec0(|x−y|−2L0) + 2B(|x − y| − 2L0) ≥ 0

for any x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| ≥ 2L0. That is, for any x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| ≥ 2L0,

eLψ(|x − y|) ≤ − 1

2 K2Ac0ec0(|x−y|−2L0)|x − y|θ−1.

According to both estimates above and the deﬁnition of ψ, we ﬁnally conclude that

there is a constant λ2 > 0 such that for any x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| > L0,

This along with the conclusion above yields the desired assertion.

eLψ(|x − y|) ≤ −λ2ψ(|x − y|).

(cid:3)

Remark 3.3. According to the argument above, we can easily improve (3.3), for ex-
ample, by taking ψ(r) = c1r − c2r1+α′
for r ∈ [0, 2L0] and changing the integral domain
{z: |z| ≤ 1
with some proper choices of c1, c2 > 0, α′ ∈ (0, α] and a ∈ (0, 1/2). For simplicity, here we
just set c1 = 1, c2 = c, α′ = α and a = 1/4.

4 |x − y|} in the deﬁnition of the coupling operator eL into {z: |z| ≤ a|x − y|}

3.2. Proofs of Theorem 1.2 and Example 1.3

We divide the proof of Theorem 1.2 into two parts.

Proof of Theorem 1.2 for |x − y| ≤ L0 or θ = 2. We will make full use of the coupling
process (X ′
tion and the expectation of (X ′
set rt = |X ′

t )t≥0 constructed in Section 2.2. Denote byeP(x,y) and eE(x,y) the distribu-

t )t≥0 starting from (x, y), respectively. For any t > 0

t |, and for n ≥ 1 deﬁne the stopping time

t − Y ′

t, Y ′

t, Y ′

Tn = inf{t > 0: rt /∈ [1/n, n]}.

For any x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| > 0, we take n large enough such that 1/n < |x − y| < n.
Let ψ be the function given in Proposition 3.1 if α ∈ (1, 2) or the function given in
Proposition 3.2 if α ∈ (0, 1]. Then

E[ψ(rt∧Tn )] ≤ ψ(r0)e−λt.

Therefore,

16

J. Wang

Since the coupling process (X ′
where T is the coupling time of the process (X ′
n → ∞ in the above inequality gives us

t, Y ′

t )t≥0 is non-explosive, we have Tn ↑ T a.s. as n → ∞,
t ). Thus, by Fatou’s lemma, letting

t, Y ′

E[ψ(rt∧T )] ≤ ψ(r0)e−λt.

Thanks to our convention that Y ′

t = X ′

t for t ≥ T , we have rt = 0 for all t ≥ T , and so

Eψ(rt) ≤ ψ(r0)e−λt.

That is,

As a result, if |x − y| ≤ L0, then for any p ≥ 1 and t > 0,

Eψ(|Xt − Yt|) ≤ ψ(|x − y|)e−λt.

E|Xt − Yt|p ≤ C(p)Eψ(|Xt − Yt|) ≤ C1e−λt|x − y|,

(3.4)

where the ﬁrst inequality follows from the deﬁnitions of the test function ψ in Propositions
3.1 and 3.2.

Now for any x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| > L0, take n := [|x − y|/L0] + 1 ≥ 2. We have

n
2

≤ n − 1 ≤

|x − y|

L0

(3.5)

Set xi = x + i(y − x)/n for i = 0, 1, . . . , n. Then x0 = x and xn = y; moreover, (3.5) implies
|xi−1 − xi| = |x − y|/n ≤ L0 for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Therefore, by (3.4) and (3.5),

In particular, the proof of the ﬁrst assertion for θ = 2 in Theorem 1.2 is completed. On
the other hand, from (3.4) and the conclusion above, we also get the second assertion for
θ > 2 with |x − y| ≤ 1 and all t > 0, or with |x − y| > 1 and 0 < t ≤ 1.
(cid:3)

Next, we turn to:

Proof of Theorem 1.2 for |x − y| > L0 and θ > 2. For |x − y| > L0, we use the
synchronous coupling and the assertion of Theorem 1.2 for |x − y| ≤ L0. In detail, with

Lp-Wasserstein distance for stochastic diﬀerential equations driven by L´evy processes 17

(1.1), let (Xt, Y (2)
same as that of (X ′

t

)t≥0 be the coupling process on R2d such that its distribution is the
t, Y ′

t )t≥0 constructed in Section 2.2. We now consider

dYt =( dZt + b(Yt) dt,

dY (2)

,

t

0 ≤ t < TL0,

TL0 ≤ t < T ,

(3.6)

where

TL0 = inf{t > 0: |Xt − Yt| ≤ L0}

and T = inf{t > 0: Xt = Yt} is the coupling time. For t ≥ T , we still set Yt = Xt. There-
fore, the diﬀerence process (Dt)t≥0 := (Xt − Yt)t≥0 satisﬁes

dDt = (b(Xt) − b(Yt)) dt,

t < TL0.

Note that the equality above implies that t 7→ Dt is a continuous function on [0, TL0)
such that limt→TL0 − |Dt| = L0. As a result,

d|Dt|2 = 2hDt, b(Xt) − b(Yt)i dt,

t < TL0.

Still denoting by rt = |Dt|, we get from (1.4) that

drt ≤ −K2rθ−1

t

dt,

t < TL0,

which implies that

TL0 ≤

K2(2 − θ)

(|x − y|2−θ − L2−θ

0

K2(θ − 2)

=: t0

(3.7)

since θ > 2 and the continuity of t 7→ rt on [0, TL0).

Therefore, for any x, y ∈ Rd with |x − y| > L0, p ≥ 1 and t > t0, we have

E|Xt − Yt|p = E[E

where in the ﬁrst inequality we have used (3.4), and the last inequality follows from (3.7)
| ≤ L0. In particular, we have for all |x − y| > L0 and
and the fact that |XTL0
t > t0,

− YTL0

E|Xt − Yt|p ≤ C3e−λt.

Combining with all conclusions above, we complete the proof of the second assertion in
Theorem 1.2.
(cid:3)

We ﬁnally present the following.

18

J. Wang

Proof of Example 1.3. In this example,

b(x) = ∇V (x) = 2β|x|2β−2x.

It follows from the proof of [5], Example 5.3, that for any x, y ∈ Rd,

hb(x) − b(y), x − yi ≤ −β24−3β|x − y|2β.

(3.8)

Then, (1.4) holds with K2 = β24−3β, θ = 2β and any positive constants K1, L0. In par-
ticular, (1.5) holds for all α ∈ (0, 1] and K1, L0 > 0 small enough. Then the required
assertion is a direct consequence of Theorem 1.2.
