A Network Approach to Unravel Correlated Ion Pair Dynamics in Protic

Ionic Liquids. The Case of Triethylammonium Nitrate

Institute of Physics, University of Rostock, Albert-Einstein-Str. 23-24, 18059 Rostock, Germany

Abstract

The intermolecular interactions in the title compound are investigated using self-consistent charge density
functional based tight binding molecular dynamics. Emphasis is put on the analysis of correlated motions
of ion pairs using ideas of network theory. At equilibrium such correlations are not very pronounced on
average. However, there exist sizeable local correlations for cases where two cations share the same anion
via two NHO-hydrogen bonds. The eﬀect of an external perturbation, which artiﬁcially introduces a sudden
local heating of an NH-bond, is investigated using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics. Here, it is found
that the average N-H bond vibrational relaxation time is about 5.3 ps. This energy redistribution is rather
nonspeciﬁc with respect to the ion pairs and does not lead to long-range correlations spreading from the
initially excited ion pair.

1. Introduction

Ionic liquids (ILs) are promising candidates for
a wide variety of applications, most importantly
as ’green’ solvents [1]. To exploit the exceptional
physico-chemical properties in novel applications,
the inﬂuence of intermolecular interactions must be
understood in great detail. The ionic character of
the molecules leads to strong Coulomb interactions,
but there are also dispersion forces [2] and a wide
range of Hydrogen bond (HB) interactions of diﬀer-
ent strength [3]. The HBs may link ions of opposite
charge into networks. Here, protic ILs are of partic-
ular interest due to their rather strong HBs. Fur-
ther, these systems allow for proton transfer from
the cation to the anion such as to create a neutral
pair.

The strong Coulomb interactions lead to a long
range ordering, which can be seen, for example, in
the radial distribution functions [4, 5]. Further-
more, the polar and nonpolar groups can segregate
and form spatial heterogeneities in the liquid [6].

For example, Canongia Lopes and co-workers anal-
ysed the mesoscopic segregation of imidazolium-
based ILs depending on the alkyl chain lengths
[7, 8]. However, the substructure of the polar re-
gions is still not solved and the concept of ion pair-
ing and long-lived neutral subunits is much debated
[9]. Important in this context is the charge trans-
fer between anion and cation, leading to absolute
ion charges below one e [10]. Zhang and Maginn
showed that the ion pair lifetimes can be linked to
transport properties [11]. The eﬀects of noncovalent
intermolecular forces can be quantiﬁed by quantum
chemical simulations on small systems down to the
atomic resolution [12]. Experimentally, these inter-
actions can be probed by NMR chemical shift mea-
surements; see, for example, the study of the eﬀect
of mixtures on HB interactions in Ref. [13]. The in-
termolecular interactions give rise to signatures in
infrared absorption and Raman spectra [14]. Both
dispersion and HB interactions show spectral signs
in the far infrared region [15, 16, 17, 18], where HB
forces manifest themselves in a blue-shift with re-
spect to the dispersion dominated band position.
In the region of CH- and NH-stretching vibrations,
the H-bonded vibrational modes appear red-shifted
with respect to the non H-bonding modes. Further-

The experimental spectra of imidazolium based ILs
could be reproduced for clusters of 8 monomers and
10 ps trajectory length, suggesting a locality in time
and space that is consistent with the ion cage inter-
pretation. A computationally less demanding ap-
proach is provided by the self-consistent charge den-
sity functional based tight-binding method (DFTB)
[31, 32, 33]. DFTB works without empirical in-
put and provides self-consistent Mulliken charges,
which account for polarization eﬀects. As far as
ILs are concerned, it was shown, for instance, that
the structure extracted from DFTB simulations
matches the predicted structures of various pro-
tic ILs,
including alkylammonium nitrates, from
diﬀraction experiments [34].

more, nonlinear spectroscopy has been employed
to investigate the inﬂuence of H-bonding on the
dephasing dynamics of the CH-stretching vibra-
tions [19].

Computer simulations are a useful tool to in-
vestigate properties of liquids [20, 21] and various
methods, ranging from coarse grained molecular
dynamics (MD) [22] to quantum chemical calcula-
tions have been applied to ILs (for an overview,
see Refs. [23, 24]). Systems consisting of hundred
thousands of atoms are routinely simulated with
various force ﬁelds [25]. Furthermore, atomic polar-
ization eﬀects can be incorporated thus improving
the agreement with experiments, but at a higher
computational cost [26, 27, 28]. A yet more realis-
tic description is provided by ab initio MD simula-
tions, which were performed for a few selected small
systems. For example, the ion pair and HB dynam-
ics of methylammonium nitrate was investigated by
Zahn et al. [29], ﬁnding that only 1.8 out of 3 pos-
sible HB sites are H-bonded and that preferred an-
gles with respect to other HB exist. The ion pairs
are long lived, however the lifetime of the individ-
ual conformations was short, a behaviour that is
called ion cage rattling. Power spectra calculated
from the velocity autocorrelation functions of ab
initio MD simulations can be employed to get in-
sights into the dynamics at a microscopic level [30].

to explore the dynamics of protic ILs. As a par-
ticular example, triethylammoniun nitrate (tEAN)
will be used, where each isolated ion pair is capable
of forming a single N-H···O HB, cf. Fig. 1 (up-
per panel). The focus will be on the quantiﬁcation
of correlated motions caused by intermolecular in-
teractions. To this end, ideas from network the-
ory are introduced [35, 36]. The ion pairs will be
considered as nodes of a network graph, which are
connected by edges. The correlation between the
pairs is quantiﬁed by the weight of the respective
edge. These weights are introduced such as to re-
late to diﬀerent types of motions, from the proton
stretching vibration to the ion pair’s hindered rota-
tion. A particular role is played by disruption and
formation of ion pairs. Two situations will be con-
sidered. First, the equilibrium case, i.e. the system
performs only thermal ﬂuctuations within a canon-
ical ensemble at a given temperature. Second, a
proton transfer reaction is triggered by artiﬁcially
raising the energy of the proton within the HB. This
way we mimic infrared excitation, whose conditions
are such as to promote proton transfer and thus
formation of a pair of neutral molecules. This sit-
uation corresponds to a rather drastic disturbance
of the system and correlations might appear in the
subsequent relaxation back to equilibrium.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2
we start with a discussion of the MD simulation
setup. Next, we provide some details concerning
the generation of nonequilibrium initial conditions.
We conclude this section by introducing the corre-
lation measures used to analyse the results. Sim-
ulation results are presented in Section 3 for both,
equilibrium and nonequilibrium cases. Finally, a
summary is provided in Section 4.

2. Theoretical Methods

2.1. Molecular Dynamics

Molecular dynamics simulations are performed
for a box consisting of 32 tEAN ion pairs with pe-
riodic boundary conditions. To simulate the liquid
phase the temperature is set to 177◦C, well above
the melting point 113 − 114◦C [37], at a density of
ρtEAN = 1.048g/cm3. To obtain equilibrated start-
ing structures ﬁrst classical MD is performed, which
is followed by production runs with the DFTB
method. For equilibration the box is simulated with
Gromacs 4.5.5 [38] with force ﬁeld parameters taken

from OPLS-AA [39] and its extension to ILs (espe-
cially partial charges were recalculated) by P´adua
and coworkers [40, 41]. Long-range Coulomb forces
were evaluated using the particle mesh Ewald sum-
mation, long range cut-oﬀ radii of 0.9 nm and a
timestep of 0.5 fs are used.

Production run DFTB simulations were done
with the DFTB+ code [42] including the 3rd or-
der correction [43] and employing the corresponding
Slater-Koster parameters 3ob [44]. Van der Waals
dispersion forces are included a posteriori in the
DFTB calulations, with parameters taken from the
Universal Force Field [45]. All runs were performed
at the Γ-point only. The equilibrated structure
obtained from the force ﬁeld was used to start a
canonical ensemble simulation in DFTB. From the
respective trajectory ﬁve starting structures for a
microcanonical trajectory were sampled randomly.
These DFTB production runs were simulated up to
a length of 25 ps using a timestep of 0.5 fs. The mi-
crocanonical ensemble was chosen in order to have
the system free from external perturbations. This
way the observed response of the system to the ex-
citation of the NH-bond is only due to the pertur-
bation of the bond and not from the random forces
of a thermostat or barostat.

Each of the ﬁve starting structures is run in
the equilibrium and nonequilibrium setup. In the
nonequilibrium setup a single selected NH-bond in
the box is excited by repositioning the respective
proton as described below in Section 2.2. All other
positions and momenta are equal to the initial con-
ditions of the equilibrium setup. In the simulation
box, on average about 18 % of the HBs motifs have
an anion, which is H-bonded to two cations (cf.
Fig. 1 (lower panel)). This suggests that for these
cases diﬀerent type of correlations between ion pairs
may be present. To account for these particular
structural motifs, we have selected two nonequilib-
rium starting geometries from each of the equilib-
rium trajectory snapshots. These are the cases with
a single and with a double HB, which yields three
25 ps trajectories for each starting geometry to be
used for the correlation analysis. The conﬁgura-
tions with a single HB between anion and cation
will be called HB1, whereas those having an anion
H-bonded to two cations are will be labeled as HB2.

2.2. Modeling the Local Excitation
A typical potential energy curve for the displace-
ment of the proton in an N-H···O HB is shown

might be diﬀerent from the more global ion pair
dynamics and a more speciﬁc measure is needed.
Here, we will use the NH-bond dipole, which would
be observable in infrared spectroscopy. Thus, we
have two types of dipole moments, (cid:126)d, for quantify-
ing correlations, which might be present in diﬀerent
types of motion and on diﬀerent time scales.

The present analysis of the equilibrium trajec-
tories provides evidence that the H-bonding be-
tween ion pairs is weak enough such as to allow
frequent changes of the H-bonding partners, includ-
ing a switch from an HB1 to a HB2 conﬁguration.
In fact such changes occur on average every 1.6 ps.
They represent an abrupt change with respect to
the above dipole moments. As a consequence, the
dipole moments are not normally distributed on the
time scale of the trajectory and hence the often
used Pearson correlation coeﬃcient analysis is not
applicable.
Instead, in order to quantify the cor-
relations of the dipole moment dynamics, the non-
parametric Spearman’s rank correlation coeﬃcients
rS are used. Given two time series xt and yt with
the time index t, Spearman’s rank correlation coef-
ﬁcient is deﬁned as [47]

(cid:80)
[(cid:80)
t(Rxt − Rx)2(cid:80)
t(Rxt − Rx)(Ryt − Ry)

t(Ryt − Ry)2]1/2

.(1)
rS(x, y) =
The rank Rxt returns the position of the value when
the time series data is ordered according to the ab-
solute values. Rx denotes the average rank of x.
Values of rS can range from -1 (negative correla-
tion) to 1 (positive correlation), with 0 being no
correlation.

Correlations will be quantiﬁed by representing
the IL as a network. Here, the ion pairs take the
role of the network nodes. The weight wij be-
tween nodes i and j is calculated from the trajec-
tories of dipole moment vectors. However, due to
the abrupt changes the commonly used analysis in
terms of ﬂuctuations with respect to the mean value
doesn’t provide the insight we are interested in. It
turned out that in order to trace the correlations
between the motions of diﬀerent ion pairs and their
HBs, which is actually strongly inﬂuenced by the
abrupt changes of bonding partners, it is useful to
look at the time series of increments of the dipole
moment vector, ∆ (cid:126)dt = (cid:126)dt − (cid:126)dt−δt (δt: MD step
size), of the ion pairs and the NH-bond distance.
This gives the respective edge weights, wij, which
are calculated from the correlation coeﬃcients rS
by considering correlations between all three vec-
tor components of the considered dipole moments,

in Fig. 2 (bottom panel), where it was assumed
that all other atoms are ﬁxed. The solutions of the
vibrational Schr¨odinger equation for this potential
are shown as well. They have been obtained us-
ing the standard Fourier Grid Hamiltonian method
[46]. To have the possibility of a transfer and to
create a pair of neutral molecules, the probability
density of the vibrationally excited state must be
reasonably high at the second minimum.
In the
representative potential plotted in Fig. 2 this was
only the case for ν > 5. Hence, in the following
excitation to the νexcited = 6 level will be assumed
to generate a nonequilibrium initial condition. To
model this excitation of the bond for the general sit-
uation, the proton is moved in 0.03 ˚A steps along
the NH-bond vector and the potential energy of the
new positions is calculated. Starting from the po-
sition where the potential energy is closest to the
energy of the of the vibrational level νexcited, the
procedure is repeated with a step size of 0.01 ˚A.
As soon as the energy approaches the energy of the
vibrational level νexcited, the respective geometry is
used to start the nonequilibrium trajectory. The
kinetic energy remains unchanged.

2.3. Correlation Coeﬃcients

In general one expects that due to the strong in-
teraction with the nitrate anion all cations form
HBs, and the IL can be described as consisting of
ion pairs. The pair dipole, pointing roughly from
the cationic nitrogen to the anion center, will be
a reasonable quantity for the analysis of correlated
motions of diﬀerent pairs. The HB motion itself

weights are converged with respect to the length of
the trajectory.

3. Results

3.1. Structural Analysis

In this section we will consider the IL as a net-
work consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are
positioned at the center of mass of the ion pair and
the edges connect all the nodes. Each edge car-
ries a weight calculated according to Eq. (2), that
represents the correlation strength between the two
nodes. First, we take a look at the unperturbed
(equilibrium) network and analyze the correlations
between the dipole moments of ion pairs and NH-
bonds. Subsequently, equilibrium and nonequilib-
rium cases will be compared. In order to link cor-
relations to local structure, the edge weights will
be analyzed with respect to the distance between
the nodes, rij, and the relative orientation of the
dipoles associated with the nodes. For the latter
we use the orientation factor

(cid:126)dj − 3((cid:126)rij

(cid:126)di)((cid:126)rij

(cid:126)dj)

κij = (cid:126)di

where (cid:126)d = (cid:126)d/| (cid:126)d| and (cid:126)r = (cid:126)r/|(cid:126)r| denote the unit vec-
tors.

The distribution of average distances and relative
orientations in the simulation box is shown in Fig. 3.
Noteworthy in this distribution is the “band” of
short distances and κij-values beyond 0.0.

Anticipating that correlations will be of particu-
lar importance at short distances, the structure of
the IL is analyzed in terms of the radial distribution
function, g(r), with respect to the center of mass
coordinates of the ion pairs.
In Fig. 4a we show
g(r) for all pairs (black) and for HB2 motifs only
(red). Apparently, the ﬁrst peak at short distances
(around 4 ˚A) is solely due to HB2 motifs. Panel b of
Fig. 4 shows the decomposition of the radial distri-
bution function with respect to diﬀerent ranges of
κij. It is nicely seen that the HB2 motif comes with
orientation factors κij > 1.5. Finally, in Fig. 4c a
decomposition in terms of angles between the pair
dipole moment vectors is provided. The HB2 mo-
tif which dominates the peak around 4 ˚A facilitates
angles between 60◦ and 120◦. Preparing for the fol-
lowing discussion it should be stressed again that
HB1 and HB2 motifs interconvert on average every
1.6 ps. Thus along a trajectory an ion pair will con-
tribute to the HB2 peak around 4 ˚A, but also to the
range of the maximum around 6.5 ˚A. In passing we
note that while being in the HB2 conﬁguration, the
notion of two pair dipoles is, of course, a bit mis-
leading since the two pairs share the same anion.

The edge weights representing correlations be-
tween the motions of the diﬀerent dipole moments
are relatively small, if averaged with respect to all
pairs in the simulation box. Speciﬁcally, we have
for the pair and NH dipoles 0.038 and 0.040, re-
spectively. A more detailed view on the correlated

motion is provided by the distance and relative ori-
entation dependence of the edge weights.In contrast
to g(r) the edge weights wij are plotted as a func-
tion of position and orientation factor averaged over
the whole trajectory.
In Fig. 5a the case of pair
dipole moments is shown. Clearly, correlations play
a role for short distances only, i.e. up to the max-
imum in g(r) in Fig. 4. Further, there is a pref-
erence for those conﬁgurations, which have parallel
dipoles (κij ≈ 1). In Fig. 5b the edge weights are
plotted for those pairs that have an HB2 motif at
some point along the trajectory. Comparing both
panels and Fig. 4 one can conclude that correlated
motion between ion pairs takes place mostly for the
HB2 conﬁguration. Or, in other words, the longer a
pair stays in a HB2 conﬁguration along the trajec-

6

tory the stronger is the correlation as measured by
the edge weight. A similar analysis has been per-
formed for the NH-bond dipoles (see Suppl. Mat.,
Fig. 1). In this case, however, we ﬁnd no distance
and orientation dependence.

3.3. Nonequilibrium Case

3.3.1. Vibrational Energy Redistribution

Before analysing the ﬂuctuation dynamics in de-
tail, the vibrational energy redistribution following
nonequilibrium excitation of an NH-bond will be
investigated. To this end, all 32 ion pairs in each
of the ﬁve starting geometries are prepared and
nonequilibrium runs for 200 fs are performed. Typ-
ical trajectories are shown in Fig. 2 (top panel).
After ’excitation’ the proton motion has a large
amplitude, but the excess energy is rapidly dissi-
pated into the environment. Eventually, the proton
gets trapped either in its original conﬁguration (ion
pair) or transiently at the HB acceptor side (two
neutral molecules). Out of the 160 nonequilibrium
setups only one pair of neutral molecules is present
after 200 fs (cf. green line in Fig. 2 (top panel)).
Hence, proton transfer is a rather unlikely event
and the ionic conﬁgurations are strongly favoured
due to the ionic background [3]. The average N-
H distance of the modiﬁed cation at the begin-
ning of the run was rNH = 1.74 ˚A. After 200 fs
the average bond distance of the excited cations is
rNH = 1.08 ˚A, i.e. close to the equilibrium bond
distance of rNH = 1.05 ˚A.

The kinetic energy of the cations is calculated
as the sum of the atomic kinetic energies and the
moving average of 50 fs is plotted in Fig. 6 for an
exemplary case. By ﬁtting the kinetic energy of the
excited cation to (cid:104)Ekin(cid:105)(t) = Eexcited×exp(−t/τ ), a
relaxation time τ can be obtained. In the ﬁve 25 ps
NVE runs the average relaxation time is τ = 5.3 ps.
Thereby, the relaxation time of cations which form
a HB to anions that themselves are not involved in
another HB, τHB1 = 7.0 ps, is larger than the re-
laxation time τHB2 = 4.1 ps of cations H-bonded to
anions that form another HB. The extra HB on the
anion appears to trigger extra dissipation pathways.
However, the intuitive picture does not apply, i.e.
neither the counter anion nor the second cation H-
bonded to the anion do show a noticeable increase
in kinetic energy (not shown). In summary, the av-
erage relaxation time is 5.3 ps, but speciﬁc values
depend on the local structure of the HBs.

all other 31 other cations for one selected trajectory.

3.3.2. Correlation Analysis

The excitation of the selected ion pair perturbs
the dynamics of all ions and therefore inﬂuences
the correlation between the pairs. According to
the analysis of the previous section, the energy
disposed into the system is rapidly redistributed
without any preference for a certain pathway.
In
Fig. 7 we give the distance and orientation resolved
change of the pair dipole correlation edge weights
between nonequilibrium and equilibrium simula-
tions, ∆wij = w(non)
. Overall, changes are
rather local, i.e. within the range where correla-
tions have been present already in the equilibrium
simulation.
Interestingly, the largest changes are
observed for those distances and orientations where
the correlations in equilibrium have been strongest,
but, here ∆wij < 0, i.e. the edge weights decrease.
It is tempting to assume that this is an eﬀect of local
heating, which increases the ﬂuctuations such that
correlated motion between neighboring ion pairs is
disturbed.

lighted for equilibrium and nonequilibrium simu-
lations. Here, a pair is counted as HB2 when it

ﬁguration in the nonequilibrium case. For the latter
pairs the situation is opposite. Closer inspection of
the trajectory revealed that the initial excitation
spreads over the simulation box, which causes HB1
into HB2 conversions and vice versa. Nevertheless,
this has no eﬀect on the local nature of the im-
portant edge weights. However, these weights are
calculated with respect to the total trajectory, i.e.
transient correlations might not be properly cap-
tured.

method of choice [48].
In the present case, the
potential target could be the NH-stretching vibra-
tion, which is part of the HB. Correlated or anti-
correlated NH-vibrations would show up in speciﬁc
oﬀ-diagonal features of the two-dimensional spec-
trum [49]. Based on the present results, triethylam-
monium nitrate cannot be recommended for such a
study. However, it can be anticipated that stronger
correlations exist for those cases where in the tri-
ethylammonium cation one or both alkyl chains
have been replaced by hydrogen, to facilitate ad-
ditional H-bonding.

Figure 8: Edge weights of pair dipoles for the equilibrium vs.
the nonequilibrium simulation. The blue stars denote those
pairs that have been initially excited in the nonequilibrium
simulation. Green symbols denote those pairs that are in a
HB2 motif in the equilibrium but not in the nonequilibrium
simulation, whereas red symbols denote those pairs where
the opposite is true. The bisecting line is drawn to guide the

4. Summary

Due to their ability to form HBs, protic ILs
are often considered as networks [15, 16]. For the
simple case of triethylammonium nitrate, we have
addressed the question to which extent such net-
works actually exist. Taking a dynamics perspec-
tive a network should imply correlated motions of
ion pairs. Using ideas from network theory, the ion
pairs were considered as nodes, connected by edges.
The weight of a certain edge was determined from
the Spearman correlation coeﬃcient, which was cal-
culated on the basis of the ﬂuctuating dipole mo-
ments.

For the present example it was found that corre-
lations are on average weak. However, sizeable local
correlations between the pair dipole moments exist.
Here, structural motifs play a prominent role, where
two cations share one anion with two N-H···O HBs.
Correlations between the dipole moments of the NH
bonds are of minor relevance. A local nonequilib-
rium situation introduced by artiﬁcially exciting a
single NH-bond vibration rapidly equilibrates on a
time scale of 5.3 ps. This changes the distribution
of correlated pairs in the simulation box, but does
not lead, e.g., to long-range correlations spreading
from the initially excited pair.

Finally, we address the question how to ob-
In princi-

serve correlated motions in protic ILs.
