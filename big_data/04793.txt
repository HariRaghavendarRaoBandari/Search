In this work, we present the f (R)-Einstein-Palatini formalism in arbitrary dimensions and
the study of consistency applied to brane models, the so-called braneworld sum rules. We

show that it is possible a scenario of thick branes in ﬁve dimensions with compact extra

dimension in the framework of the f (R)-Einstein-Palatini theory by the accomplishment of

an assertive criteria.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Braneworld models have received a large amount of attention in the high-energy community

since the outstanding Randall-Sundrum model [1], providing a precise relation between a warped

geometry and the mass scale of an eﬀective TeV universe. Soon after the establishment of warped

models, a plethora of models, generalizations, and applications where developed [2]. Most impor-

tantly to our purposes was the smooth extension of warped branes, ﬁrst introduced by Gremm in

[3]. From the perspective that there must exist a typical length scale below what our understanding

of the physical laws should be, at lest, superseded by a full quantum gravity theory, the idea of

inﬁnitely thin branes, as used in the Randall-Sundrum model, is only an approximation, though

highly nontrivial.

A crucial point concerning smooth extensions of branewords (see [4] for a comprehensive review)

in General Relativity theory is that it is always necessary to preclude of the extra dimension orbifold
topology used in the original Randall-Sundrum model. After all, the S1/Z2 is also important to
make contact to Hoˇrava-Witten theory [5]. With eﬀect, there is an exhaustive theorem which forbids

smooth generalizations of the usual Randall-Sundrum model [6] (see also [7]). By usual, we mean

a ﬁve dimensional braneworld endowed with non-separable geometry whose extra dimensions are

compact, within the context of General Relativity. In a gravitational theory diﬀerent from General

Relativity, however, the situation may be diﬀerent. In fact, by applying the so-called braneworld

sum rules (a set of consistency conditions obtained from the gravitational equations of motion) it is

possible to see that smooth generalizations of the Randall-Sundrum framework are indeed possible.

Many extensions based upon the ideas delineated in the previous paragraph was done. The

investigation of braneworld sum rules applied to smooth branes generalization in the context of

Brans-Dicke and f (R) gravity has been studied in some detail in [8]. In these cases it is always
possible to show that the sum rules can be relaxed by the presence of additional terms coming from

the gravitational theory (other than the usual case) in question. The f (R) theory analyzed in [8]
was worked out in the light of the metric formalism. As it is well known, however, that the metric

and Palatini formalisms are not equivalent in the approach to f (R) gravity [9, 10]. One of the main
diﬀerences between the two approaches is given by the fact that in the metric formalism the trace

of ﬁelds equations gives rise to a dynamical degree of freedom, whilst in the Palatini formalism

this procedure lead to an algebraic constraint. Concerning the problem we are interested here, we

shall see that the necessary condition leading to a smooth brane extension is considerably modiﬁed,

presenting a more clear criteria, namely, a f (R) theory with negative ﬁrst derivative with respect
to R.

One of the diﬃculties that may arise when performing the sum rules regards the Einstein

tensor managing. Here, we use a simple conform transformation in the metric to accomplish the

sum rules program and extend the consistency conditions in the scenario of theories f (R) adopting
the Palatini formalism. This work is organized as follows. In Section II, we brieﬂy present the

sum rules idea for braneworld scenarios. In the following Section we construct the ﬁeld equations

in a f (R)-Einstein-Palatini formalism in arbitrary dimensions. In Section IV, we apply the sum
rules to the f (R)-Einstein-Palatini case, investigating the relevant condition which leads to smooth
branewords. In the last Section we conclude.

II. SUM RULES FOR BRANEWORLD SCENARIOS

Much of the necessary formalism to the implementation of sum rules in the f (R)-Einstein-
Palatini context was developed elsewhere [7, 8]. Therefore, we shall pinpoint some important aspects

in this Section. By considering the spacetime as a D-dimensional manifold endowed with a non-

factorisable geometry, we write the line element as

ds2 = gAB(X)dX AdX B = W 2(r)gµν (x)dxµdxν + gab(r)dradrb,

(1)

3

where W 2(r) is the warp factor, X A denotes the coordinates of the full D-dimensional spacetime,

xµ stands for the (p + 1) coordinates of the non-compact spacetime (brane), and ra labels the

(D − p − 1) directions in the internal compact space. The classical action takes into account the
spacetime dynamics coupled to a scalar ﬁeld, namely

S = Sgravity +Z dDX √−g(cid:18)−

1
2

∂AΦ∂AΦ − V (Φ)(cid:19) ,

(2)

where we assume that the scalar ﬁeld has only dependence on the internal space coordinates

Φ = Φ(rm). The scalar ﬁeld above shall be understood as the responsible to generate the brane.

We leave the potential unspeciﬁed since it will not be relevant in our case. The energy-momentum

tensor gives

and

Tµν = −W 2gµν(cid:18) 1

2∇Φ · ∇Φ + V (Φ)(cid:19) ,

Tab = ∇aΦ∇bΦ − gab(cid:18) 1

2∇Φ · ∇Φ + V (Φ)(cid:19) .

It is possible to show [6, 7] that the following expression holds

∇ · (W α∇W ) =

W α+1

p(p + 1)hα (cid:0)W −2 ¯R − Rµ

a(cid:17)i ,
µ(cid:1) + (p − α)(cid:16) ˜R − Ra

(3)

(4)

(5)

µ = W −2gµνRµν and Ra

where Rµ
a and α is
an arbitrary parameter. Moreover, ¯R is the scalar of curvature derived from gµν and ˜R the scalar

a = gabRab are the partial traces such that R = Rµ

µ + Ra

of curvature associated to the internal space. The braneworld sum rules can be obtained from two

considerations, one physical and one mathematical. From the physical point of view it is necessary

to specify the gravitational theory in question, i. e. write Sgravity. This being done (notice that the

dynamics is speciﬁed accordingly), one is able to use the fact that, as far as the internal space is

periodic without boundary, the left hand side of (5) vanish under integration.

III. THE f (R)-EINSTEIN-PALATINI FORMALISM IN ARBITRARY DIMENSIONS

In the so-called Palatini formalism the metric and the connection are assumed to be independent

variables. The ﬁeld equations are derived from the variation of the Einstein-Hilbert action with

respect to metric and connection independently. Thus, the Ricci and Riemann tensors are objects

constructed from a general aﬃne connection, but without the torsion terms.

4

It is well known that the deﬁnition TAB ≡ 2/√−gδSM /δgAB when implemented along with the
principle of least action for f (R)-Einstein-Palatini gravity, leads to the following ﬁeld equations

and

f (R)gAB = 8πGDTAB,

− ∇C(√−gf ′(R)gAB) + ∇D(√−gf ′(R)gD(A)δB)

C = 0,

(6)

(7)

such that when f (R) = R, the Palatini formalism restores general relativity. Rewriting Eq. (7) we

get

− ∇C (√−gf ′(R)gAB) +

1

2 h∇D(√−gf ′(R)gDA)δB

C + ∇D(√−gf ′(R)gDB)δA

Ci = 0,

and contracting the indices C e B we are left with

Therefore Eq. (7) reads simply

∇D(√−gf ′(R)gDA) = 0.

∇C (√−gf ′(R)gAB) = 0.

In this vein, by deﬁning a metric hAB as

hAB ≡ f ′(R)

hAB ≡ f ′(R)

we formally have the connection equation

As a last step, by assuming the internal space compact (as in the standard cases) the left hand

side of Eq. (23) vanishes upon integration. Following the standard presentation we denote these

integrating over the internal space, it is possible to obtain the sum rules to the very general case in

integrations by H ∇ · (W α∇W ) = 0. Hence, by inserting the energy-momentum partial traces and
the scope of f (R)-Eintein-Palatini theory. The result is quite large, and its generality contributes
to overshadow its physical content.

In order to extract physical information it is convenient to particularize the analysis to the

D = 5 and p = 3 case. Thus we shall investigate a ﬁve-dimensional bulk with an unique extra
dimension ( ˜R = 0) endowed to a orbifold topology, for instance. Besides, in this four-dimensional
brane context we can implement the physical constraint ( ¯R = 0) in trying to describe our universe

in large scales. Therefore, after these particularizations, and using equations (3) and (4) for the

sources, we have the following set of conditions

Among all consistency conditions encoded in (24), each related to a given α, there are many

irrelevant. As a matter of fact, in order to explore the smooth branes possibility the choice α = −1
is particularly elucidative, since it eliminates the overall warp factor. In fact, this choice provides

simply

rewritten as

27πG5 I (ln|F (R)|)′ · (ln|F (R)|)′ = 0.

(26)

Now it turns out that whether F (R) is positive, then it is impossible to achieve a smooth gener-
alization of usual braneworld models, since the resulting constraint

of smooth 3-branes in a ﬁve dimensional bulk. In comparing with the metric approach, where

the negative quantity were proportional to H F (R)−1∇2F (R), the result obtained in the Palatini
context is indeed exhaustive. As a ﬁnal remark, notice that in the limit F (R) → 1, i. e. f (R) → R,
Eq. (28) reduces to H Φ′ · Φ′ = 0, just as in usual General Relativity (as expected), a constraint

which can never be reached.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

8

The modeling of warped smooth branes has given rise to a somewhat more formal branch of

research in the context of braneworld gravity. In turn, this line of investigation has lead to the solid-

iﬁcation of braneworld models in several diﬀerent perspectives, since non-compact extra dimension

[11], diﬀerent bulk cosmological constants [12], and ingenious single thick branes approach [13],

just to enumerate some. In which concern this paper, the general idea is not to set a speciﬁc model,

but instead to provide a comprehensive scope from which consistent models can be constructed up.

It is shown that smooth generalizations of the usual Randall-Sundrum braneworld model can be

achieved in f (R) gravity. This is already know from previous work [8], but here we have worked in
the Palatini formalism to f (R). Apart from the fact that the metric and the Palatini formalisms to
f (R) are inequivalent, the analysis performed here has culminating into a more clear and assertive
constraint to be fulﬁlled.

Even though it is not our purpose here the proposition of models, we shall emphasize that

among all the possible generalizations leading to smooth 3-branes in a ﬁve dimensional within non-

separable geometry (and a compact extra dimension), the use of f (R)-Eintein-Palatini formalism
seems to be a quite promising approach. This is because, once again, in this context it is possible

to extract a simple and sharp necessary criteria.
