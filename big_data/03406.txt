Identiﬁcation of nematic superconductivity from the upper critical ﬁeld

Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA

J¨orn W. F. Venderbos, Vladyslav Kozii, and Liang Fu

Recent nuclear magnetic resonance and speciﬁc heat measurements have provided concurring
evidence of spontaneously broken rotational symmetry in the superconducting state of the doped
topological insulator CuxBi2Se3. This suggests that the pairing symmetry corresponds to a two-
dimensional representation of the D3d crystal point group, and that CuxBi2Se3 is a nematic super-
conductor. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the upper critical ﬁeld Hc2 of nematic
superconductors within Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. Contrary to typical GL theories which have
an emergent U(1) rotational symmetry obscuring the discrete symmetry of the crystal, the theory
of two-component superconductors in trigonal crystals reﬂects the true D3d crystal symmetry. This
has direct implications for the upper critical ﬁeld. First, Hc2 of trigonal superconductors exhibits a
sixfold anisotropy in the basal plane. Second, when the degeneracy of the two components is lifted
by, e.g., uniaxial strain, Hc2 exhibits a twofold anisotropy with characteristic angle and tempera-
ture dependence. Our thorough study shows that measurement of the upper critical ﬁeld is a direct
method of detecting nematic superconductivity, which is directly applicable to recently-discovered
trigonal superconductors CuxBi2Se3, SrxBi2Se3, NbxBi2Se3, and TlxBi2Te3.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Unconventional superconductors can be deﬁned by su-
perconducting order parameters that transform nontriv-
ially under crystal symmetries. For a given superconduc-
tor, possible unconventional order parameters are classi-
ﬁed by non-identity representations of the crystal point
group. Such representations are either one-dimensional
or multi-dimensional, and this distinction deﬁnes two
classes of unconventional superconductivity [1, 2]. The
ﬁrst class is exempliﬁed by d-wave superconductors in
cuprates [3, 4], while the second class is exempliﬁed by
the p-wave superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 [5], with two
degenerate components (px, py) at the superconducting
transition temperature. Superconducting states in the
second class spontaneously break lattice or time-reversal
symmetry [6], in addition to the U(1) gauge symmetry,
leading to novel thermodynamic and transport proper-
ties not seen in single-component superconductors. The
search for new superconductors with multi-component
order parameters is therefore of great interest.

The doped topological insulator CuxBi2Se3, a super-
conductor with Tc ∼ 3.8K [7, 8], has recently attracted
a lot of attention as a promising candidate for uncon-
ventional superconductivity [9–19]. Fu and Berg pro-
posed that it may have an odd-parity pairing symmetry
resulting from inter-orbital pairing in a strongly spin-
orbit-coupled normal state [9]. While previous surface-
sensitive experiments [20, 21] drew disparate conclusions
regarding the nature of superconductivity in this mate-
rial, direct tests of the pairing symmetry in the bulk of
CuxBi2Se3 are carried out only very recently. A nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement [22] found that
despite the three-fold rotational symmetry of the crys-
tal, the Knight shift displays a twofold anisotropy be-
low Tc as the ﬁeld is rotated in the basal plane. The
twofold anisotropy is also found in the speciﬁc heat of
the superconducting state under magnetic ﬁelds down to
H = 0.03T corresponding to H/Hc2 ∼ 0.015 [23]. Both

experiments found that the twofold anisotropy vanishes
in the normal state, establishing that the superconduct-
ing state of CuxBi2Se3 spontaneously breaks the three-
fold rotational symmetry. This is only possible when the
order parameter belongs to the two-dimensional Eu or Eg
representation of the D3d point group. The Eg pairing
has been ruled out by comparing the theoretically ex-
pected gap structure [24] with speciﬁc heat data [8, 23].
These results taken together strongly suggest that the
pairing symmetry of CuxBi2Se3 is Eu, an odd-parity pair-
ing with two-component order parameters [9].

Spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking due to su-
perconductivity is a rare and remarkable phenomenon.
Superconductors exhibiting rotational symmetry break-
ing from multi-component order parameters can be called
nematic superconductors [24], in analogy with the ne-
matic liquid crystals and nematic electronic states in
non-superconducting metals [25, 26]. Nematic and chi-
ral superconductivity, the latter breaking time-reversal
symmetry, are the two distinct and competing states of
multi-component superconductors, corresponding to real
and complex order parameters respectively [1, 6]. Bro-
ken rotational symmetry has previously been reported
in the heavy-fermion superconductor UPt3 [29] under a
magnetic ?eld [28]. In addition, the A phase in a nar-
row temperature range at zero ﬁeld is likely rotational
symmetry breaking, which however may be due to anti-
ferromagnetic order already present in the normal state
[30, 31]. Thus the recent discovery of broken rotational
symmetry in CuxBi2Se3, without broken time-reversal
symmetry, may potentially open a fruitful research di-
rection.

Motivated by the recent experimental progress, in this
work we study the upper critical ﬁeld Hc2 of trigo-
nal nematic superconductors within the framework of
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. Such GL theory admits
a new trigonal gradient term which is not allowed in
hexagonal crystals [27]. We relate the gradient terms
to Fermi surface and gap function anisotropies by a mi-

2

croscopic calculation of the GL coeﬃcients. Building
on and generalizing the previous work [27], we show
that the upper critical ﬁeld generically displays a sixfold
anisotropy within the basal plane of trigonal crystals. We
further show that a uniaxial strain acts as a symmetry-
breaking ﬁeld in nematic superconductors, which directly
couples to the bilinear of the two-component supercon-
ducting order parameter. As a result, Hc2 in the basal
plane exhibits a twofold anisotropy with a distinctive
angle and temperature dependence, similar to theoret-
ically expected results for UPt3 in the presence of anti-
ferromagnetic order [45, 46]. Our ﬁndings suggest that
measurement of the upper critical ﬁeld is a direct method
of detecting nematic superconductivity.
In particular,
this method may shed light on the pairing symmetries
of other superconducting doped topological insulators
SrxBi2Se3 [32, 33], NbxBi2Se3 [34] and TlxBi2Te3 [35],
which have yet to be determined.

to fourth order in η, and we have deﬁned η† = (η∗1, η∗2).
The coeﬃcients A ∝ T − Tc and B1,2 are phenomenologi-
cal constants of the GL theory. The sign of GL coeﬃcient
B2 determines the nature of the superconducting state,
selecting either chiral or nematic order [24, 36].

Spatial variation of the superconducting order param-
eter is captured by the gauge-invariant gradient Di =
−i∂i − qAi, with (cid:126)A the electromagnetic vector potential
and q = 2e. In case of multicomponent order parameters,
there generally exist multiple independent gradient terms
which are allowed by crystal symmetry. It is insightful
to present all gradient terms in order of “emergent sym-
metry”. For crystals with a principal rotation axis along
the z direction, such as the three- and sixfold rotations of
trigonal and hexagonal crystals, four gradient terms with
full continuous in-plane rotational symmetry are present
and given by [1, 37, 38]

We start by constructing the GL theory of odd-parity
two-component superconductivity in trigonal crystals
with strong spin-orbit coupling. The pairing potential
ˆ∆((cid:126)k), which is a (cid:126)k-dependent matrix in spin space, takes
the following form

ˆ∆((cid:126)k) = η1 ˆ∆1((cid:126)k) + η2 ˆ∆2((cid:126)k).

(1)

The pairing potential is a linear superposition of two de-
generate components ˆ∆1,2((cid:126)k), the basis functions of the
two-dimensional trigonal pairing channel Eu. For odd-
parity superconductors the pairing components satisfy
ˆ∆1,2(−(cid:126)k) = − ˆ∆1,2((cid:126)k). A key property of (doped) Bi2Se3
materials is strong spin-orbit coupling that locks the elec-
tron spin to the lattice. The two complex ﬁelds η1,2 de-
ﬁne the superconducting order parameters η = (η1, η2)T .
In contrast, in case of triplet superconductors in spin-
rotation invariant materials the order parameter compo-
nents are vectors in spin space.

The GL theory of two-component superconductivity is
formulated in terms of the order parameters η and the

GL free energy Ftot =(cid:82) d3(cid:126)x ftot is the sum of a homoge-

neous term and a gradient term given by ftot = fhom+fD,
where fhom and fD are the corresponding free energy den-
sities.
In addition, the free energy contains a Maxwell
term fEM = ((cid:126)∂ × (cid:126)A)2/8π, which for our purposes can
be taken as a constant. The free energy densities fhom
and fD are polynomial expansions in the order parameter
ﬁelds and their gradients, and consist of all terms invari-
ant under the symmetry group of the crystal. For two-
component trigonal superconductors the homogeneous
contribution is the same as the corresponding expression
for hexagonal symmetry [1, 6],

fhom = Aη†η + B1(η†η)2 + B2|η∗1η2 − η∗2η1|2,

(summation understood, i = x, y, a = 1, 2), and J1,2,3,4
are the phenomenological GL coeﬃcients. The ﬁrst three
terms are invariant under independent U(1) rotation of
coordinates and order parameters, and thus have an
emergent U(1)×U(1) symmetry, whereas the gradient
term with coeﬃcient J4 is invariant under arbitrary joint
rotations of coordinates and order parameters, i.e., an
emergent U(1) symmetry. Therefore, fD does not reﬂect
the discrete rotational symmetry of the crystal. However,
a new gradient term fD,trig, is uniquely present in crys-
tals with trigonal symmetr, but not allowed in hexagonal
crystals [27]. It is given by the expression

fD,trig = J5 [(Dzη1)∗Dxη2 + (Dzη2)∗Dxη1

+(Dzη1)∗Dyη1 − (Dzη2)∗Dyη2 + c.c.] .

(4)

The appearance of this new gradient term, which has D3d
symmetry, can be understood from angular momentum,
since in trigonal symmetry L = 3 is equivalent to L = 0.
Indeed, in momentum space (Di → qi) the trigonal gra-
dient term can be expressed as iqz(q−η∗+η− − q+η∗
−η+),
where q± = qx ± iqy and similarly for η1,2. The relative
phases between η+ (q+) and η− (q−) are determined by
mirror symmetry: η1 (η2) is even (odd) under x → −x. It
follows from the structure of fD,trig that in trigonal crys-
tals spatial variation of the order parameter in the basal
plane is coupled to spatial variation in the z-direction,
which is in sharp contrast to hexagonal and tetragonal
crystals. In the rest of this work we map out the conse-
quences of trigonal crystal anisotropy in the GL theory
for the upper critical ﬁeld.

III. UPPER CRITICAL FIELD IN THE BASAL

PLANE

The angular dependence of Hc2 was ﬁrst proposed as
a method to establish the multicomponent nature of un-
conventional superconductors in the context of heavy-
fermion superconductors [40–42]. The key idea is as fol-
lows. For the class of single-component (e.g., s-wave)
superconductors with trigonal, tetragonal, and hexago-
nal symmetry, Hc2 is always isotropic within the GL the-
ory, due to the emergence of U (1) rotational symmetry to
second order in the gradients. In case of multicomponent
superconductors, eﬀects of crystal anisotropy can appear
in the GL theory, removing the emergent U(1) symme-
try, but this crucially depends on crystal symmetry. For
instance, hexagonal systems with multicomponent order
parameters do not show in-plane Hc2-anisotropy due to
the emergent rotational symmetry of Eq. (3), whereas
tetragonal symmetry can give rise to an angular depen-
dence of Hc2 with fourfold symmetry [41].
In trigonal
crystals, Hc2 can exhibit a sixfold anisotropy in the basal
plane [27] as of Eq. (4). Here we map out the basal plane
upper critical ﬁeld of trigonal superconductors for general
GL gradient coeﬃcients.

Within GL theory, the upper critical ﬁeld is calculated
by solving the GL equations obtained from Ftot, keeping
only terms linear in η since the order parameter is small
at Hc2. Therefore, the calculation also applies to chiral
superconductors. The resulting system of GL equations
can be solved as a two-component harmonic oscillator
problem, leading to a Landau-level spectrum from which
Hc2 is determined as the lowest Landau-level solution.
The coupling of the two harmonic oscillators is deter-
mined by the structure of the GL equations, and is in
general complicated by the presence of multiple gradient
terms.
In hexagonal and tetragonal systems, straight-
forward or even exact analytical expressions for Hc2 can
be found [41].
In contrast, the trigonal gradient term
of Eq. (4) couples basal plane gradients to gradients in
the orthogonal direction, giving rise to a diﬀerent set of
harmonic oscillator equations to which previous methods
do not apply. A special limiting case was considered in
Ref. 27. We generalize this result by solving the trigo-
nal GL equations in the presence an in-plane magnetic
ﬁeld for general gradient coeﬃcients. In deriving the gen-
eral solution we adopt an operator based approach and
exploit that harmonic oscillator mode operators corre-
sponding diﬀerent cyclotron frequencies can be related
by squeezing operators. The details of our calculations
are presented in the Supplemental Material.

To demonstrate the key features of Hc2 in trigonal crys-
tals, we will focus the discussion on the most physical
case, where trigonal anisotropy eﬀects may be considered
weak and J5 can be treated as perturbation. We take the
magnetic ﬁeld (cid:126)H in the basal plane to be given by (cid:126)H =
H(cos θ, sin θ, 0). Taking J4 = 0 ﬁrst, solving the GL
equations yields two degenerate series of Landau levels
with cyclotron frequency ω = √J1J3, with the upper crit-

ical ﬁeld given by Hc2 = −A/2eω = −A/2e√J1J3. In-

1 ∓ |J4|J3/ω2 = ω

cluding the gradient contribution in Eq. (3) proportional
to J4 simply makes the cyclotron frequencies inequiva-
1 ∓ |J4|/J1, and in-
lent, ω1,2 = ω
creases the upper critical ﬁeld to Hc2 = −A/2eω1. This
deﬁnes the exactly solvable unperturbed system. Then,
introducing trigonal perturbation (parametrized by J5)
couples the two series of Landau levels with diﬀerent fre-
quencies in a nontrivial way: the coupling of in-plane and
out-of-plane gradients implies a coupling of canonically
conjugate operators of the form {Dz, Dx,y} ∼ {−i∂z, z}.
To solve the system of GL equations we assume that crys-
tal anisotropy eﬀects are weak and use second order per-
turbation theory to obtain the correction to the cyclotron
frequency −δω1. The upper critical ﬁeld then becomes
Hc2 to lowest order in J5 as

Hc2 = (cid:101)Hc2(1 + δω1/ω1) with (cid:101)Hc2 ≡ −A/2eω1. We ﬁnd

F (0) = 1, which implies that for J4 = 0 (correspond-
ing to ω−/ω+ = 0) no angular dependence of Hc2 exists.
The latter is a consequence of an emergent rotational
symmetry of fD,trig in Eq. (4): it is invariant under in-
plane rotations of the order parameters and coordinates
according to q+ → q+e2iϕ, η+ → η+e−iϕ. (Note that this
is not a physical symmetry.)
In general, however, considering all regimes of gradient
coeﬃcients that satisfy the stability constraints of the
free energy, Hc2 exhibits a six-fold anisotropy in the basal
plane trigonal crystals. For instance, the sixfold Hc2-
anisotropy can be obtained starting from a solution of the
GL equations derived from Eqs. (3) and (4) for J5 (cid:54)= 0
and J4 = 0, and treating J4 as a small perturbation. This
case was considered in Ref. 27.
Figure 1 shows the angular dependence of the upper
critical ﬁeld for small to moderate J5/ω = J5/√J1J3 and
J4/J1 as obtained from Eq. (5). Note that in general,
for materials with weak to moderate (crystal) anisotropy
eﬀects, one expects J1 ∼ J3. To make the interplay be-
tween J4 and J5 explicit, we expand Eq. (5) for small

IV. NEMATIC SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND

UPPER CRITICAL FIELD

4

Within our GL theory, the rotational symmetry break-
[22, 23]
ing superconducting state reported in Refs.
corresponds to a real order parameter,
i.e., η =
η0(cos φ, sin φ)T . Up to fourth order [see Eq. (2)], the
angle φ represents a continuous degeneracy. This degen-
eracy is lifted at sixth order by a crystal anisotropy term
and leads to a discrete set of degenerate ground states
[24, 36]. In materials, such as CuxBi2Se3, the remaining
degeneracy may be further lifted by a symmetry-breaking
pinning ﬁeld, selecting a unique ground state. The ori-
gin of such pinning can be strain-induced distortions of
the crystal, but in principle, any order with the same
symmetry, electronic or structural, can pin the order pa-
rameter. In case of two-component superconductors, the
symmetry-breaking (SB) pinning ﬁeld couples linearly to
order parameter η in the following way

fSB = g(cid:2)(uxx − uyy)(|η1|2 − |η2|2) + 2uxy(η∗1η2 + η∗2η1)(cid:3) ,

(8)

with coupling constant g. The order parameter bi-
linears (|η1|2 − |η2|2, η∗1η2 + η∗2η1) constitute a two-
component subsidiary nematic order parameter [24] with
the same symmetry as the symmetry-breaking ﬁeld
(uxx − uyy, 2uxy).
For comparison, uniaxial strain
in single-component superconductors couples to the
gradient of the order parameter ψ, taking the form
˜J1,x|Dxψ|2 + ˜J2,y|Dyψ|2 diﬀerent from Eq. (8).
It is
worth noting that the coupling considered here diﬀers
from the candidate theories proposed for the hexagonal
superconductor UPt3, in which case magnetic order cou-
ples quadratically, instead of linearly, to order parameter
bilinears [29, 31, 37, 38, 43, 44].

From a microscopic perspective, the origin of the or-
der parameter pinning in Eq. (8) can be understood as a
(strain-induced) Fermi surface distortion, leading to dif-
ferent Fermi velocities vF,x (cid:54)= vF,y. A uniaxial distortion
of this form couples to |η1|2 − |η2|2 and has the eﬀect
of selecting either η = (1, 0) or η = (0, 1) by raising Tc,
resulting in a split transition. A quantitative calculation
of the coupling constant g, relating the order parame-
ter bilinear to such Fermi surface distortion can be ob-
tained within weak-coupling (see [39]). This eﬀect of a
Fermi surface distortion should be compared to uniaxial
gradient anisotropies such as ∼ |Dxηa|2 − |Dyηa|2 and
∼ |Diη1|2 − |Diη2|2, with the eﬀect of the former being
enhanced by a factor of ln(ωD/Tc)(ξ/ξ0)2 [39], where ξ
is the coherence length, ln ωD/Tc ∼ 1/V N (εF ), ωD is a
cutoﬀ frequency, and V is an eﬀective interaction energy
scale associated with the pairing. In addition, the eﬀect
of a uniaxial Fermi surface distortion ∼ vF,x/vF,y on the
shift of Tc is enhanced by ln ωD/Tc.
To address the eﬀect of the SB ﬁeld on Hc2 in case of
the trigonal nematic superconductors, we solve the lin-
earized GL equations for small J4,5 gradient coeﬃcients
in the presence of a uniaxial symmetry breaking term

Within weak coupling, the GL coeﬃcients Ji can be
obtained in terms of Fermi surface and gap function
properties using a microscopic mean-ﬁeld Hamiltonian
with pairing potential ˆ∆((cid:126)k) given by Eq. (1). The gra-
dient coeﬃcients J1, J3, J4, and J5 are proportional to
N (εF )v2
0, where εF , vF , and ξ0 are the
Fermi energy, Fermi velocity, and correlation length re-
spectively, and N (εF ) is the density of states (see Sup.
Mat.). We ﬁnd that their relative strength depends on
the crystal anisotropy of the Fermi surface and of the gap
functions ˆ∆1,2((cid:126)k). In particular, J5 is nonzero only when
trigonal Fermi surface anisotropy is present, or when the
gap function is composed of trigonal crystal spherical
harmonics of the Eu pairing channel, and is generally
expected to be weak.

The general sixfold basal plane anisotropy of Hc2 is a
direct consequence of trigonal symmetry and a discrim-
inating characteristic of two-component pairing symme-
try.
Indeed, single-component superconductivity corre-
sponding to one-dimensional pairing channels of D3d can-
not exhibit sixfold Hc2 anisotropy: the in-plane gradient
term is given by ˜J1|Diψ|2 and has emergent U(1) rota-
tional symmetry. As a result, the sixfold anisotropy pro-
vides a clear experimental evidence for two-component
pairing.

rial. A similar problem of upper critical ﬁeld anisotropy
was studied for split transitions in UPt3 [45, 46].

for J5 = 0 in Eq. (5), to ﬁrst order in J4/J1 (i.e., ω1
expanded to ﬁrst order in J4/J1). For J4 = 0 we simply
ﬁnd Hc2 = Hc2,0 [see Eq. (7)], but with critical temper-
ature T ∗c = Tc + ∆Tc with ∆Tc ∼ |δ|. This follows from
comparing δ to A ∼ (T − Tc), i.e., δ shifts the transition
temperature and can be taken as a measure of T . We
deﬁne a dimensionless temperature t by T = T ∗c − t∆Tc.
For general J4/J1 and nonzero δ we solve Eq. (9) for
Hc2 and show the representative results for J4/J1 = 0.1
and J4/J1 = 0.6 in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). Two key char-
acteristics of Hc2 in the presence of a pinning ﬁeld are
evident in Fig. 2(a)–(b). First, the angular dependence of
Hc2 exhibits a distinct two-fold anisotropy, with a typical
“peanut”-shape close to T ∗c . This twofold anisotropy be-
comes more pronounced with increasing J4/J1, as shown
Fig. 2(b). Expanding the square root in Eq. (9) under the
assumption of very small ﬁelds, i.e., l2
b (cid:29) J4J3/2ωδ, one
ﬁnds Hc2 ∝ (1 − J4sgn(δ) cos 2θ/2J1). This “peanut”-
shape of the Hc2 proﬁle should be contrasted with the
Hc2 proﬁle of single-component superconductor where
uniaxial gradient anisotropy leads to a weak elliptical
angular dependence of Hc2, an eﬀect which is paramet-
rically smaller than the twofold anisotropy in the two-
component case. Consequently, the twofold anisotropy
of Hc2 shown in Fig. 2, in particular the “peanut”-shape,
is a discriminating property of two-component pairing.

Second, the angular dependence of Hc2 is a function
of temperature and has diﬀerent shape in the vicin-
ity of T ∗c (i.e., small ﬁelds) as compared to far below
Tc (and high ﬁelds). This is in sharp contrast to the
usual case, for instance Eq. (5), where only the overall
magnitude of Hc2 is temperature dependent. The un-
usual temperature dependence of Hc2 can be more pre-
cisely captured by considering the upper critical ﬁeld
anisotropy ratio Hc2( π
2 )/Hc2(0) as function of temper-
ature. In the vicinity of T ∗c , the anisotropy ratio should

(1 + J4sgn(δ)/2J1)/(1 − J4sgn(δ)/2J1). This is shown
in Fig. 2(c), where the Hc2-anisotropy ratio is plotted for
various values of J4/J1. In contrast, using Eq. (9) we ﬁnd
that the Hc2-anisotropy ratio approaches unity for large
temperature t according to ∼ 2/(t−1), which is indepen-

was also found and discussed in the context of a hexago-
nal applicable to UPt3 [45–47]. The distinctive tempera-
ture dependence of Hc2-anisotropy is uniquely associated
with two-component pairing since single-component pair-
ing with uniaxial gradient anisotropy leads to tempera-
ture independent Hc2-anisotropy.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

To summarize,

in this work we have addressed the
magnetic properties of two-component superconductors
in trigonal crystals. Starting from a general GL theory
of trigonal two-component superconductors, we ﬁnd that
the upper critical ﬁeld exhibits a sixfold anisotropy in
the basal plane, which is a discriminating property of
two-component pairing. The sixfold anisotropy is a rare

of crystal anisotropy are typically obscured in GL theory
by an emergent U(1) rotational symmetry. In addition,
in this work we show that when a symmetry breaking
ﬁeld originating from, e.g., structural distortions selects
a real order parameter, Hc2 exhibits a twofold anisotropy
with characteristic angular and temperature dependence.
The recent NMR and speciﬁc heat measurements on
CuxBi2Se3, which reported spontaneously broken rota-
tional symmetry, indicate that this material belongs to
the class of superconductors with two-component pair-
ing symmetry. Prominent other examples of materials
with trigonal symmetry, which have attracted increasing
attention recently, are the doped Bi2Se3 superconduc-

tors SrxBi2Se3, NbxBi2Se3, and TlxBi2Te3. Our theory
of in-plane anisotropy of upper critical ﬁeld stands to
contribute to uncovering the pairing symmetry of these
superconductors, which remains to be determined.

VII. LANDAU THEORY OF TRIGONAL TWO-COMPONENT SUPERCONDUCTORS

A Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory of two-component superconductivity in a trigonal crystal is formulated in terms of
the superconducting order parameters, which in turn are obtained from pairing potential. In the presence of spin-orbit
coupling, when spin-rotation symmetry is broken, and the symmetry group is the symmetry group G of the crystal
lattice, the superconducting pairing potential ˆ∆((cid:126)k) is decomposed into irreducible representations of G. In most cases,
one is interested in a single pairing channel, i.e., a single representation of the symmetry group, which may be one-
or multi-dimensional. The pairing matrix ˆ∆((cid:126)k) corresponding to pairing channel Γ takes the form [1–3]

ˆ∆((cid:126)k) =

ηΓ,m ˆ∆Γ,m((cid:126)k),

(10)

(cid:88)

m

where Γ labels the representation (i.e., pairing channel) and m labels the components of the representation. The
expansion coeﬃcients ηΓ,m are the superconducting order parameters and are complex scalars.
In case of two-
component superconductors the order parameter is the two-component complex number η ≡ (η1, η2)T .
the order parameters η1,2 to given order,

The GL free energy functional describing the two-component superconductor is then obtained as an expansion in

which consists of terms fully invariant under the symmetries of the crystal. Therefore, the GL free energy depends on
the crystal symmetry group as well as the pairing channel. A trigonal crystal admits two two-component represen-
tations, Eg (even parity) and Eu (odd parity), and in both cases the free energy density up to fourth order is given
by

f = F/V = A(|η1|2 + |η2|2) + B1(|η1|2 + |η2|2)2 + B2|η∗1η2 − η1η∗2|2,

(12)

in terms of the expansion coeﬃcients A ∝ (T − Tc) and B1,2. When the GL coeﬃcient B2 is positive (B2 > 0) the
order parameter η is real and breaks rotational symmetry. In that case, a continuous degeneracy remains at fourth
order, which is lifted by crystal anisotropy eﬀects at sixth order. The sixth order contribution to the free energy
density reads as

f (6) = C1[(η∗+η−)3 + (η∗

−η+)3] + C2(|η1|2 + |η2|2)3 + C3(|η1|2 + |η2|2)|η∗1η2 − η1η∗2|2,

(13)

(where η± = η1 ± iη2) and it is the ﬁrst term, proportional to C1, which is responsible for lifting the continuous
degeneracy and selecting three degenerate ground states related by threefold rotation.
We extend the GL theory to include terms representing spatial inhomogeneity: the gradient terms. The super-
conductor is a charged superﬂuid with charge q = 2e, and gradient terms are introduced by deﬁning the covariant
derivative as Di = −i∂i − 2eAi, where Ai is the electromagnetic vector potential.
The gradient terms of the free energy expansion are obtained using the same representation theory recipe as before.
The derivative components (Dx, Dy) transform as Eu, and Dz transforms as A2u of the trigonal point group. These
representations are used to form products with (η1, η2), from which bilinears with the general structure

are obtained. Here Xia is a tensor transforming irreducibly under crystal symmetry (see Table I). A gradient term is
then simply given by |DiXiaηa|2, with an independent phenomenological stiﬀness constant for each distinct represen-
tation.

TABLE I: Table listing the gradients terms present in a trigonal crystal (i.e., D3d symmetry). On the left the irreducible tensors
Xia and corresponding bilinears are shown. On the right, a multiplication table of trigonal representations is presented. This
table assumes (η1, η2) have Eu symmetry, but the results for Eg are obtained by exchanging the symmetry labels g ↔ u.

We now discuss all gradient terms of an odd-parity two-component superconductor in a trigonal crystal. We start
from the gradient terms which have a continuous U(1) rotational symmetry with respect to the coordinates and order
parameters individually, thus giving rise to an emergent U(1)×U(1) symmetry. They are given by

fD,U (1)×U (1) = J1(Diηa)∗Diηa + J2ijab(Diηa)∗Djηb + J3(Dzηa)∗Dzηa,

(15)

with gradient coeﬃcients Ji (and a sum over repeated i, j and a, b is understood, and i, j = x, y). As a result of the
emergent U(1)×U(1) symmetry, these gradient terms obscure the true trigonal crystal symmetry.
Whether or not the true crystal symmetry is reﬂected in the GL gradient expansion of multicomponent order
parameters depends on the crystal system. For instance, in case of hexagonal symmetry (i.e., point group D6h) the
gradient terms are obtained by considering all irreducible tensors Xia of the hexagonal group. For the two-component
representations E1u,1g the gradient terms are given by [2]
fD = K1|Dxη1 + Dyη2|2 + K2|Dxη2 − Dyη1|2 + K3(|Dxη1 − Dyη2|2 + |Dxη2 + Dyη1|2) + K4(|Dzη1|2 + |Dzη2|2).
(16)

A very similar result is obtained for the E2u,2g representations. This can be rewritten to obtain (see also, e.g., [4, 5])

fD,U (1)×U (1)[J1, J2, J3] + fD,4[J4] = J1(Diηa)∗Diηa + J2ijab(Diηa)∗Djηb + J3(Dzηa)∗Dzηa

When crystal symmetry is lowered to trigonal symmetry, an additional gradient term arises which reﬂects the true
D3d symmetry of the crystal. Table I lists all irreducible tensors Xia and their symmetries. With the help of this table
it is straightforward to obtain all gradient terms. One observes that there are two distinct tensors with Eg symmetry.
As a result, a cross term of these two is an allowed gradient term. Speciﬁcally, the additional gradient term, deﬁned
fD,trig[J5], takes the form [6]

fD,trig[J5] = J5 [(Dxη2)∗Dzη1 + (Dxη1)∗Dzη2 + (Dyη1)∗Dzη1 − (Dyη2)∗Dzη2 + c.c.] ,

= J5 [τ x

(19)

The new gradient term is a consequence of trigonal anisotropy and is absent in hexagonal crystals, as is clear from
Eq. (17). This is rooted in the fact that in the presence of six-fold rotations p- and d-waves (angular momentum l = 1
and l = 2, respectively) have distinct symmetry, whereas in trigonal crystals they belong to the same representation. In
momentum space (Di → qi) the trigonal gradient term can be expressed as iqz(q−η∗+η−−q+η∗
−η+), where q± = qx±iqy
and similarly for η1,2. The relative phases between η+ (q+) and η− (q−) are determined by mirror symmetry: η1 (η2)
is even (odd) under x → −x. Even though the trigonal gradient term has D3d, and breaks the U(1) symmetry of
Eq. (17), it possesses an emergent rotational symmetry: it is invariant under in-plane rotations of the order parameters
and coordinates according to q+ → q+e2iϕ, η+ → η+e−iϕ. This, however, is not a physical symmetry.

The GL theory of odd-parity two-component superconductors can be further extended by considering the coupling
to other orders. In general, multi-component orders can be characterized by subsidiary order parameters. In case of
the two-component trigonal superconductors, the subsidiary order parameters have symmetry A2g and Eg, and the
corresponding bilinears of primary ﬁelds are given by

Here κ and (N1, N2) deﬁne the chiral and nematic subsidiary order parameters, respectively.

(|η+|2 − |η−|2),

2

(20)

(21)

The coupling of the superconducting order to other orders is easily understood in terms of the subsidiary orders.

A general magnetic order parameter (cid:126)M is a pseudo-vector and transforms as

Mz → A2g,

(Mx, My) → Eg,

(22)

under trigonal symmetry D3d. From Eq. (21) we ﬁnd that the only term that can couple to the magnetic order is of
the form |η+|2 −|η−|2, giving rise to a coupling Mz(|η+|2 −|η−|2). The magnetic order parameter Mz can be thought
of as a Zeeman ﬁeld in the z direction coupling to the electron (pseudo)spin as ∼ Mzσz.
A structural deformation of the crystal, which leads to the breaking of rotational symmetry, can be expressed in
terms of the strain tensor uij. Speciﬁcally, the uniaxial and shear strain components (uxx − uyy, 2uxy) transform as
an Eg doublet. As a result, these two strain tensor components can couple to the nematic superconductor associated
with Eg subsidiary order.

In terms of the coupling constants gM and gN we can write the contribution to the GL free energy coming from

the magnetic and nematic coupling as

gM Mz(|η+|2 − |η−|2) + gN [(uxx − uyy)N1 + 2uxyN2]

(23)

As is clear from the form of this term, the eﬀect of symmetry breaking induced by the magnetic and nematic ﬁelds is
to lift the degeneracy of the two-component pairing.

It is important to note that when we use the term “strain” here we very generally mean any nonmagnetic spin-

rotation invariant order transforming as Eg.

VIII. SOLVING GINZBURG-LANDAU EQUATIONS FOR UPPER CRITICAL FIELD Hc2

In this section we present the solutions of the GL equations in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld (cid:126)H, from which we
ﬁnd the expressions for the upper critical ﬁeld Hc2. We ﬁrst derive the GL equations from collecting the free energy
contributions of Eqs. (11), (17), and (19).

we write the total free energy as Ftot =(cid:82) d3(cid:126)x ftot, where ftot is the total free energy density. The free energy density

We ﬁrst derive the full set of GL equations governing the odd-parity two-component superconductor. To this end

has the following contributions

ftot = f [A, B1, B2] + fD,U (1)×U (1)[J1, J2, J3] + fD,4[J4] + fD,trig[J5],

(24)

where we make the functional dependence on GL coeﬃcients explicit. The contribution from the electromagnetic ﬁeld
(cid:126)A, given by fEM = ((cid:126)∂ × (cid:126)A)2/8π is neglected since it does not play a role in our theory. The GL equations follow from
functional variation with respect to the ﬁelds and are given by

We consider the case of a magnetic ﬁeld applied in the z-direction (i.e., perpendicular to the basal plane of the
trigonal crystal) given by (cid:126)H = H ˆz. The corresponding vector potential in the symmetric gauge is (cid:126)A = −H(cid:126)x × ˆz/2 =
−Hijxj/2, whereas in the Landau gauge (cid:126)A = Hxˆy.

The GL equations (collecting the results J1-J4) for the order parameter η read

It will be beneﬁcial to perform a basis transformation to positive and negative angular momentum combinations

In addition to an order parameter change of basis, we deﬁne the covariant derivatives D± = Dx ± iDy. In terms of
the angular momentum basis for the Di operators, the operators appearing in the GL equations are given by

The problem of solving the GL equations is equivalent to the problem of two-component fermions in a magnetic ﬁeld.
To see this, we note that [Dx, Dz] = [Dy, Dz] = 0 and [Dx, Dy] = 2ieij∂iAj = 2ieH = i/l2
b . The latter commutation
relation is the well-known commutation relation for momentum components in a magnetic ﬁeld. We have deﬁned
a magnetic length lb = 1/√2eH. Based on the commutation relation we deﬁne raising and lowering operators as
Π± = lbD∓/√2 and substitute the expression in the GL equations to obtain

The J4 term (and J5 term) has been suppressed for the moment. The raising and lowering operators obey [Π−, Π+] = 1
by deﬁnition. Furthermore, we see that inhomogeneity in the z-direction can only increase the (energy) eigenvalues
and therefore corresponds to lower Hc2. We take Dzη = 0. Then, including the J4 term, the GL equations read

It may be simply checked that this system of equations is solved by either of the following solutions

Trigonal anisotropy in the GL equations thus couples the raising and lowering operators to Dz, and does not aﬀect
any homogeneous solution deﬁned by the condition Dzη = 0. It is possible that an inhomogeneous solution has lower
energy and therefore higher Hc2. To investigate this we take Dzη = qzη. Setting J4 = 0 as a ﬁrst step, this leads to

The largest Hc2 corresponds to the n = 0 solution. Such solution for Hc2 should be compared to the solution of the
homogeneous case, i.e., choosing ˜qz = 0 to begin with. That solution is simply given by

If this is larger, then a homogeneous solution gives the correct Hc2. For realistic values of the gradient coeﬃcients,
the homogeneous solution always leads to a larger Hc2.

Hc2 = |A|[4e(J1 − |J2|)]−1,

(41)

C. The case (cid:126)A = Hz(sin θˆx − cos θˆy)

Next, we come to the case of magnetic ﬁeld in the basal plane: (cid:126)H = H(cos θ, sin θ, 0)T . The corresponding vector

potential conﬁguration is given by (cid:126)A = Hz(sin θ,− cos θ, 0)T , and in this gauge we have

Dx = −i∂x + 2eHz sin θ,

Dy = −i∂y − 2eHz cos θ,

(42)

in addition to Dz = −i∂z. Since the ﬁeld is directed along a unit vector (cos θ, sin θ, 0)T in the xy plane, it is convenient
to rotate the covariant derivative operators so that they are aligned with and orthogonal to the ﬁeld direction. We
deﬁne

(cid:19)

(cid:18) D(cid:107)

D⊥

(cid:18)cos θ

=

sin θ
sin θ − cos θ

(cid:19)(cid:18)Dx

(cid:19)

Dy

,

(43)

where D(cid:107) is along the ﬁeld and D⊥ is orthogonal to the magnetic ﬁeld. As a result, D(cid:107) plays the same role as Dz
when the ﬁeld is applied along the z-axis (see Sec. VIII B), and we have that [D(cid:107), D⊥] = [D(cid:107), Dz] = 0. The two
components D⊥ and Dz do not commute and deﬁne the magnetic algebra, i.e., [Dz, D⊥] = −2ieH. In order to solve
the GL Eq. (30) we reexpress them in terms of D(cid:107),⊥. The quadrature simply transforms as D2
⊥, and
we ﬁnd for the two “d-wave” components
D2
y = cos 2θ(D2
x − D2
{Dx, Dy} = sin 2θ(D2

⊥) + sin 2θ{D(cid:107), D⊥},
⊥) − cos 2θ{D(cid:107), D⊥}.

(cid:107) − D2
(cid:107) − D2

y = D2
(cid:107)

x + D2

+ D2

(44)

Note that [Dx, Dy] = 0. Following the standard approach, we assume homogeneity in the direction along the ﬁeld,
i.e., D(cid:107)η = 0, implying that we can ignore all terms containing D(cid:107).

The trigonal contribution to the GL equations takes the form

6

which, after rewriting in terms of D(cid:107),⊥ and neglecting D(cid:107) becomes

J5 [{Dz, Dx}τ x

abηb + {Dz, Dy}τ z

abηb] ,

To solve this set of equations we employ the commutation relations of the operators Dz and D⊥, which give rise
to a magnetic algebra equivalent to the case of Dx,y when the ﬁeld is applied in the z-direction (see Sec. VIII B).
Speciﬁcally, we have [Dz, D⊥] = −i/l2
b , which implies that Dz and D⊥ satisfy a canonical commutation relation.
It will be convenient to deﬁne eﬀective “momentum” and “position” operators ˆP = lbDz and ˆX = lbD⊥, so that
[ ˆX, ˆP ] = i.
The appearance of the anti-commutator {Dz, D⊥} ∼ { ˆX, ˆP} in Eq. (49) complicates this set of equations signiﬁ-
cantly, as it is not diagonal in the basis of harmonic oscillator states deﬁned by the raising and lowering operators
obtained from ˆX, ˆP . Therefore, the presence of two gradient terms originating from (trigonal) crystal anisotropy, the
J4 and J5 terms, does not allow for a straightforward exact solution for arbitrary gradient coeﬃcients.

To proceed, we map out the consequences of trigonal anisotropy terms on Hc2, starting from a number of limiting
cases. In doing so, we obtain the full functional dependence of the upper critical ﬁeld on the gradient coeﬃcients.
We will start by considering the cases J5 = 0 (as applicable to hexagonal crystals), and J4 = 0, i.e., when only the
trigonal gradient coeﬃcient J5 is present. Then, we introduce the neglected terms perturbatively.

1. The hexagonal symmetry case (J5 = 0)

This is the simplest case, as it reduces to the case of hexagonal symmetry (rather than trigonal symmetry, we
are eﬀectively assuming additional artiﬁcial symmetry) and the result is well-known [8]. It is nevertheless helpful to
express the result in the present language. The system to solve takes the form

(51)

Hence, this system gives rise to two series of Landau levels. The upper critical ﬁeld is simply determined by the lowest
Landau level solution of the series with the smallest cyclotron frequency. Speciﬁcally, the upper critical ﬁeld is given
by

(cid:101)Hc2 = max

i=1,2{ −A

We note that here, in the Supplemental Material we deﬁne the cyclotron frequencies ω1, ω2 (and similarly for ω,
ω± below) in a dimensionless fashion. A diﬀerent convention is used in the Main Text, where an overall factor J3 is
absorbed in the cyclotron frequencies.

We can now write the system of GL equations as a matrix equation for η = (η1, η2)T and ﬁnd

where I is the identity matrix. It is convenient to diagonalize the J4 term by performing the following rotation

2. The case when J4 = 0 (only J5)

As a next case, we make the assumption that J4 = 0, yet J5 is nonzero, which may be called pure trigonal case.
For this case, it is helpful to go back to equation (47), which is expressed in terms of the η variables. The system to
solve is then given by

and it is convenient to perform an order parameter rotation deﬁned by

−Aη =(cid:2)(J1D2

with ω2 = J1/J3. Since this system is diagonal, we can focus on the diagonal entries individually. To ﬁnd the
eigenvalues of such system, we introduce the raising and lowering operators Π± = ( ˆP + iω ˆX)/√2ω, with Π+ = Π†
−.

We then have for the right-hand side of Eq. (56)

To proceed, we redeﬁne the raising and lowering operators by performing the following “rotation”: (cid:101)Π± = e±iπ/4Π±.

It can be checked that this corresponds to a rotation in the space of operator variables ˆX and ˜P . Note that such
rotation preserves the operator algebra. We then ﬁnd that (57) takes the form

Note that this implies a stability condition on the value of J5 in relation to J1,3, since the system does not make sense
if J5 exceeds both J1,3.

3. J5 as a perturbation

Let us now reconsider Eqs. (49) and (50). We want to consider the J5 term as a perturbation to Eq. (50). It
is convenient to use squeezing operators to make the cyclotron frequencies match in Eq. (50). Let us assume that
ω2 > ω1 (the calculation for the opposite case is equivalent), and take ω2/e2r = ω1. We then have

(cid:16)

ˆS(r) = e2r(cid:16)

ˆS†(r)

ˆP 2 + ω2

ˆP 2 + ω2

where we have used a squeezing operator with θ = π (see Sec. VIII E). With this transformation, we bring the matrix

which does not yet include the J5. The matrix operator in Eq. (46) proportional to J5, which we call H(cid:48) and consider
as a perturbation, takes the following form after applying the squeezing transformation

(cid:18)

ˆX 2 → ω1((cid:101)Π+(cid:101)Π− +(cid:101)Π−(cid:101)Π+), { ˆX, ˆP} → −((cid:101)Π2
the latter case the squeezing operator is deﬁned in terms of (cid:101)Π±.

Let us ﬁrst consider the diagonal matrix elements. We recognize that they have the same structure as in the
case considered above (J4 = 0, J5 (cid:54)= 0). They can therefore be diagonalized in the same manner. We make the
substitutions ˆP 2 + ω2
−) and ˆS(r, θ = π) → ˆS(r, θ = π/2), where in
1
In that case we can ignore
the coupling between the two series of Landau levels. All we are then left with is diagonalizing the matrix entry
corresponding to ω1. This was achieved in the previous section and we simply substitute J5 → J5 cos 3θ. The
cyclotron frequency ω1 transforms in the same way as ω (see above) and we obtain

We can immediately deduce an expression for Hc2 in case r (cid:29) 1, i.e., ω1 (cid:28) ω2.

It is important to note that this limit corresponds to (J1 − |J4|)/(J1 + |J4|) (cid:28) 1 with the hard constraint |J5| <
(J1 − |J4|)J3, which also should be considered a rather unphysical limiting case.
Let us now explore the case ω1 ∼ e2rω1(= ω2). In this case we cannot ignore the coupling between the two series of
Landau levels. It is convenient to work with raising and lowering operators Ξ± = ( ˆP + iω1 ˆX)/√2ω1 (instead of the
operators Π±, which are deﬁned in terms of ω). The eigenstates of the unperturbed system are given by [note that
this is after squeezing of the second component, i.e., in the basis (g1, g2)T ≡ (f1, ˆS†f2)T ]

+ − Ξ2

The ground state wave function of the unperturbed system is (|0(cid:105), 0)T . The operator part of the perturbation is given
by { ˆX, ˆP} = −i(Ξ2
In general, when applying perturbation theory one must make two assumptions. First, one must obviously require
that J5/J3 (cid:28) ω1 for the whole exercise to make sense. Second, one could naively think that whether to apply
degenerate or non-degenerate perturbation theory depends on the smallness of J5/J3 as compared to the diﬀerence
of the frequencies, i. e., whether the condition J5/J3 (cid:28) ω2 − ω1 is satisﬁed or not.
It turns out, however, that
non-degenerate perturbation theory is suﬃcient even if the latter inequality is not satisﬁed. The reason for this is that
the correction perturbative in J5 remains small in the limit ω1 → ω2. We conﬁrm this conclusion explicitly applying
degenerate perturbation theory.
In light of the latter discussion, we ﬁrst consider non-degenerate perturbation theory. Given the operator part of
the perturbation, we directly conclude that there is no ﬁrst order correction to the cyclotron frequency. The second
order correction to the cyclotron frequency is given by the sum of contributions from the two series of Landau level
states, and it takes the form

The presence of the squeezing operator complicates the summation in the last term. With the help of the properties

Including the correction (74), the cyclotron frequency becomes ω1 + δω. The upper critical ﬁeld Hc2 is always
obtained from dividing −A/2e by the cyclotron frequency, and therefore the upper critical ﬁeld becomes, to lowest

Naively one would think that non-degenerate perturbation theory is no longer justiﬁed when J5/J3 is larger than
ω2−ω1, in which case we must resort to (quasi)-degenerate perturbation theory. We will now present calculation using
(quasi)-degenerate perturbation theory, and show that the result exactly equals the result of Eq. (74). We comment
on this below.

In this limiting case, we start by reconsidering Eq. (56). In order to treat the gradient term with coeﬃcient J4, we

ﬁrst perform the same rotation of order parameter variables. This yields

In order to express this in the same operators that were used to solve Eq. (56), we ﬁrst have to rotate the raising

and lowering operators [i.e., Π± → (cid:101)Π±, see Eq. (58)] and then apply the squeezing transformation. After rotation we
have ˆX → ( ˆX + ˆP /ω)/√2 and therefore ˆX 2 → ( ˆX 2 + ˆP 2/ω2 + { ˆX, ˆP}/ω)/2. Applying the squeezing transformation

leads to

The next step is to evaluate the expectation value of the oﬀ-diagonal elements. This is more involved as a result of
the appearance of the squeezing operators. We ﬁnd that the oﬀ-diagonal elements take the form

5. Summary of the result for Hc2 in the presence of trigonal anisotropy

For convenience and clarity of presentation, here we collect the main results of basal plane Hc2 calculations. In
particular, we list the expressions for Hc2 in all limiting cases we considered, and state their ranges of applicability.

13

Taking J5 = 0, the case which is applicable to a hexagonal crystal, the exact solution is

J5 = 0,

Hc2 =

(95)

(cid:112)

J3(J1 − |J4|)

IHc2 does not exhibit any angular dependence due to the emergent U (1) symmetry of the GL equations.

Taking J4 = 0, where J5 is the only gradient coeﬃcients in addition to J1,2,3 the exact solution of the GL equations

is

J4 = 0,

Hc2 =

2e

(cid:112)

−A

.

(96)

Due to an emergent (but unphysical) rotational symmetry of the GL equations, Hc2 is isotropic (see Main Text).

We obtain the following approximate solution in the case where |J4| ≈ J1 and J5 satisﬁes the stability constraint

(cid:112)

J5 <

Hc2 =

(97)

The most physical case arises when J4 takes arbitrary values (but |J4| < J1 due to stability constraints) and J5 is

small. The expression for Hc2 reads as

(cid:112)

|J5| (cid:28)

J3(J1 − |J4|),

Hc2(θ) =

where F (x) is the function deﬁned in Eq. (73), and deﬁnitions of ω, ω±, ω1,2 are listed in Table II.

We also considered the opposite case, where J5 is arbitrary and satisﬁes J5 < √J1J3, and J4 is small. The result is

This reproduces the result of Ref. 6. The advantage of this solution is that it can be obtained by ﬁrst-order perturbation

D. Upper critical ﬁeld in the presence of symmetry breaking ﬁeld

We now come to the problem of calculating Hc2 in the presence of a symmetry breaking ﬁeld which pins the order
parameter along a preferred axis. As in the main text, we take the symmetry breaking ﬁeld to have xx−yy symmetry,
ijη∗i ηj. We then solve the GL equations in the presence of
which implies a contribution to the free energy given by δτ z
an in-plane magnetic ﬁeld (see Sec. VIII C) for two cases: (i) when only J4 is present (J5 = 0), and (ii) when both J4
and J5 are present.

1. Symmetry breaking ﬁeld δ and J4

14

We ﬁrst consider case of J4 only, where trigonal anisotropy is set to zero [11, 12]. Starting from Eq. (47) and adding

the symmetry breaking ﬁeld, the GL equations take the form

This system of equations is similar to what has been considered in the context of UPt3 [11, 12]. In order to ﬁnd the
upper critical ﬁeld, we simply project it into the lowest Landau level solutions (|0(cid:105), 0)T and (0,|0(cid:105))T . This is justiﬁed
as long as J4 (cid:28) J1. Noting that (cid:104)0| ˆX 2|0(cid:105) = 1/2ω, we ﬁnd the following implicit equation for the upper critical ﬁeld

Here x is a measure of the strength of the hexagonal anisotropy J4 as compared to the (unperturbed) cyclotron

parameters the equation reads

It is important to note that the magnetic length, and therefore the magnetic ﬁeld, enters this expression in a non-trivial
way. The physical implication is that the upper critical ﬁeld will exhibit diﬀerent behavior close to Tc as compared
to far below Tc. This may be understood from the fact that the symmetry breaking ﬁeld splits the transitions of two
order parameter components at zero ﬁeld, as Tc depends linearly on δ within the framework of GL theory.

At this point, it is worth commenting on the variable t [the parameters x and y were deﬁned in Eq. (105)]. To make
its signiﬁcance explicit, we write explicitly A = A(cid:48)(T − Tc),. In weak-coupling A(cid:48) is equal to (up to the constant of
the order one) the density of states. Then, the transition temperature in the presence of the pinning ﬁeld δ is shifted
to T ∗c = Tc + |δ|/A(cid:48), or ∆Tc = T ∗c − Tc = |δ|/A(cid:48). In this notation, t = −1 − (T − T ∗c )/∆Tc, and t takes the role of
an eﬀective temperature through T = T ∗c − (t + 1)∆Tc. Note that in the Main Text we have left the proportionality
constant A(cid:48) implicit in the deﬁnition of t. Also note that in the superconducting state t takes values t ≥ −1. We
thus observe that the upper critical ﬁeld, in particular its angular dependence, is a function of temperature through
t = t(T ).

Let us see how this is reﬂected in the Hc2 anisotropy coeﬃcient Hc2( π

2 )/Hc2(0). We ﬁnd that it takes the form

Hc2( π
2 )
Hc2(0)

= −x sgn(y) − 2t − |2 + x sgn(y)t|
x sgn(y) − 2t − |2 − x sgn(y)t|

.

Close to T ∗c , at t < 2/x (corresponds to T > Tc − 2J1|δ|/J4A(cid:48)), it can be shown to reduce to

Hc2( π
2 )
Hc2(0)

1 + x sgn(y)/2
1 − x sgn(y)/2

=

1 + J4 sgn(δ)/2J1
1 − J4 sgn(δ)/2J1

,

(113)

(114)

which is independent of temperature and in agreement with Eq. (109). In contrast, when t > 2/x, i.e., at temperatures
far below T ∗c , we ﬁnd that [in case sgn(y) > 0]

Hc2( π

(115)

Since this expression does not depend on x, we conclude that far below T ∗c (measured in units of ∆Tc), the upper

critical ﬁeld anisotropy ratio has a temperature dependence which is independent of J4 (See Main Text).

Strictly speaking, Eq. (104) is valid when J4 is small. We can also address a diﬀerent limiting, in which no
assumptions are made with regard to J4, but instead we assume relatively large magnetic ﬁeld (temperature is far
J3(J1 − |J4|) (cid:29) |δ|. In this case, the equation from which Hc2 can be determined reads
below Tc), expressed as eH

In terms of the position and momentum operators the equations read

Under the assumption that both J4 and J5 are small, we can construct a degenerate perturbation theory up to second
order. Such perturbation theory up to ﬁrst order is what produced Eq. (104), and the eﬀect of J5 only enters at
second order. Using the same basis states as in Eq. (78) and writing η as η = α|1(cid:105) + β|2(cid:105), we ﬁnd the followong matrix

In the same way as above, the upper critical is found by considering the lowest eigenvalue of the matrix equation and

where we have used the same deﬁnitions of x, y as in Eq. (105), in addition to the deﬁnition z = J5/J3ω = J5/√J1J3.
It is easy to see from this equation, that to second order in both J4 and J5 the corrections to Eq. (104) do not
introduce qualitatively diﬀerent behavior.

One can carry out perturbation theory up to third order in both J4 and J5, which will introduce the sixfold

anisotropy into the equation, entering as a term proportional to ∼ |J4|J 2
5 .
To conclude, we consider a ﬁnal limiting case, in which we take J4 = 0 and assume that we are in a regime of large
ﬁelds, i.e., far below Tc measured in units of δ. In this case we must again resort to quasi-degenerate perturbation
theory and derive the Hamiltonian in the low-energy subspace to second order in J5/J3. The calculation proceeds
along the same line as the calculation based following Eq. (79). We ﬁnd the Hamiltonian up to second order as

From this equation we can already infer that for large ﬁelds, i.e., δ → 0 the twofold anisotropy of the angular
dependence vanishes.

E. The operator algebra of squeezed states

In this section we provide additional information on the squeezing operators used to solve linearized GL equations
in a magnetic ﬁeld. The starting point is the simple harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian ˆP 2 + ω2 ˆX 2. The eigenvalues of
this operator are found using the raising and lowering operators Π± = ( ˆP + iω ˆX)/√2ω, with Π+ = Π†
−, which satisfy
[Π−, Π+] = 1.

The squeezing operator is deﬁned as

(cid:26) 1

(cid:27)

ˆS(z) = exp

(z∗Π2

− − zΠ2
+)

2

,

z = reiθ

(125)

where z is a complex number characterizing the squeezing. The name squeezing operator originates from the fact
that momentum and position quadratures are “squeezed” under application of these unitary operators. Note that the
squeezing operators are unitary and therefore preserve commutation relations.

Their action on the raising and lowering operators is given by

(126)
Since the position and momentum operators are related to Π+± Π−, we have the for these quantities after application
of the squeezing operators

ˆS†(z)Π−
ˆS(z) = cosh rΠ− − eiθ sinh rΠ+
ˆS†(z)Π+ ˆS(z) = cosh rΠ+ − e−iθ sinh rΠ−

ˆS†(z) ˆP ˆS(z) = (cosh r − cos θ sinh r) ˆP + ω sin θ sinh r ˆX
sin θ sinh r ˆP
ˆS†(z) ˆX ˆS(z) = (cosh r + cos θ sinh r) ˆX +

1
ω

Note that in case z is purely real, θ = 0, the momentum and position operators transform as

ˆS†(z) ˆP ˆS(z) = e−r ˆP
ˆS†(z) ˆX ˆS(z) = er ˆX

(127)

(128)

and it is precisely this rescaling which is a manifestation of squeezing. It is this property that will be used to express
the solutions of two harmonic oscillator problems with diﬀerent frequencies in terms of the same raising and lowering
operators.

For the present purposes we need the matrix elements of the squeezing operators. In order to ﬁnd them we ﬁrst
the structure of the squeezed vacuum. In particular, we relate the raising and lowering operation on the squeezed
vacuum. We ﬁnd

ˆSΠ−|0(cid:105) = 0 = ˆSΠ−

ˆS† ˆS|0(cid:105) = (cosh rΠ− + sinh rΠ+) ˆS|0(cid:105), → cosh rΠ−

ˆS|0(cid:105) = − sinh rΠ+ ˆS|0(cid:105)

(129)

With the help of this relation we ﬁnd the following expressions for the matrix elements that need to be calculated,

ˆS|0(cid:105) = n(cid:104)n| ˆS|0(cid:105),

(cid:104)n|Π+Π−
(cid:104)n|Π−Π+ ˆS|0(cid:105) = (n + 1)(cid:104)n| ˆS|0(cid:105),
(cid:104)n|Π+Π+ ˆS|0(cid:105) = −n

We ﬁnd that the matrix elements (cid:104)n| ˆS|0(cid:105) are the only objects we need. Furthermore, for our purposes we only require
the absolute value squared |(cid:104)n| ˆS|0(cid:105)|2, which is know is in the literature [10], and given by

IX. MICROSCOPIC CALCULATION OF GL COEFFICIENTS

The purpose of this section is to calculate the GL coeﬃcients, which up to this point have been treated as phe-
nomenological expansion constants, from a microscopic model for paired electrons within a weak-coupling BCS ap-
proach. This will allow us to express the GL coeﬃcients in terms of quantities characterizing the electronic normal
state, i.e., the Fermi surface properties.

The calculation proceeds as follows. We ﬁrst consider a microscopic mean-ﬁeld theory in which pairs of electrons
are coupled to a bosonic order parameter ﬁeld. The mean-ﬁeld action is quadratic in the fermionic ﬁelds, which can
be integrated out to obtain an eﬀective free energy the superconducting order parameter ﬁelds. The eﬀective action
is an expansion of this free energy in the order parameter ﬁelds (i.e., the Ginzburg-Landau free energy) with the
expansion coeﬃcients given by fermion loop diagrams. Explicit evaluation of the loop diagrams yields expressions for
GL coeﬃcients in terms of quantities directly related to the Fermi surface electrons.

The starting point of our calculation is a mean-ﬁeld action S = S0 +S∆, expressed in terms of the electron operators
ψα((cid:126)x, τ ), where S∆ represents a coupling to a pairing potential ˆ∆((cid:126)x, (cid:126)x(cid:48)) (a matrix in spin space). Speciﬁcally, we
start from the action

(cid:90)

(cid:104)

S =

dτ d3(cid:126)x ψ†α((cid:126)x, τ )

∂τ + ε(−i∂/∂(cid:126)x) − εF

(cid:105)

(cid:90)

(cid:104)

Here ε((cid:126)p) is the normal state kinetic energy as function of momentum operator (cid:126)p = −i∂/∂(cid:126)x, and εF is Fermi energy.
At this stage we do not include the electromagnetic gauge potential explicitly, but instead impose gauge invariance
at the end.

Taking the Fourier transform, the superconducting part of the action is expressed as

(133)

where (cid:126)k is the momentum variable conjugate to the relative coordinate, and (cid:126)q is conjugate to the center-of-mass
coordinate as follows

The superconducting order parameter ˆ∆((cid:126)q, (cid:126)k) is decomposed as ˆ∆((cid:126)q, (cid:126)k) = (cid:80)

d(cid:126)xd(cid:126)x(cid:48) ˆ∆((cid:126)x, (cid:126)x(cid:48)) exp[−i(cid:126)q ·

ˆ∆((cid:126)q, (cid:126)k) =

2 − i(cid:126)k · ((cid:126)x − (cid:126)x(cid:48))].

m ηm((cid:126)q) ˆ∆m((cid:126)k). Here ηm((cid:126)q) are the
complex order parameters and ˆ∆m((cid:126)k) are the superconducting structure factors corresponding to component m of
the multi-dimensional representation [speciﬁed in Eq. (151) below].

(134)

with τ± = (1/2)(τ x ± iτ y).
We are now in the position to write down the full action S = S0 + S∆, which is bilinear in the electron operators
and can be integrated to obtain an eﬀective Seﬀ[ηi]. First, we transform to Matsubara frequency space and write
k = (iω, (cid:126)k) and q = (0, (cid:126)q). Note that we have set the bosonic frequencies to zero since we will only be interested in
static spatial inhomogeneities. The full electronic action S then takes the form

hole Green’s functions G± on the diagonal. The hole Green’s function is obtained from particle-hole conjugation of
the electron Green’s function, and one has

where F0 is the normal state part of free energy. Here, the trace Tr is understood as a sum over frequency and
momenta, and as a matrix trace over the matrix structure of ˆG0 and ˆΣ∆: Tr ≡
(cid:126)k tr. We note that since we
restrict to the quasiparticle part of the free energy, we have left the contribution to the free energy which is quadratic
in the order parameter ﬁeld and explicitly depends on the pairing interaction implicit.

We now focus on the derivation of the free energy to the second order in ˆ∆. Explicitly, it is given by the expression

A. Calculation of gradient coeﬃcients J1,2,3,4,5 in presence of trigonal crystal anisotropy

We now proceed to the calculation of the gradient coeﬃcients J1,2,3,4,5. In particular, we demonstrate that the
trigonal gradient term fD,trig (see Main Text) is generated only when the Fermi surface has trigonal crystal anisotropy,
or when the gap functions are general linear combinations of crystal harmonics allowed by trigonal symmetry. Hence,
we take into account the trigonal anisotropy of the Fermi surface (FS) and the speciﬁc form of the pairing potential
ˆ∆m((cid:126)k) applicable to trigonal symmetry.

In the case of trigonal distortion, energy spectrum of electrons can be described as

ξ((cid:126)k) = ξ0((cid:126)k) + δξ((cid:126)k) = ξ0((cid:126)k) + i

where ξ0 = k2/2m − εF , k± = kx ± iky and kF = √2mεF is Fermi momentum. Here we have neglected all other

fourth order contribution to the dispersion, since they aﬀect the result only quantitatively and in a way unimportant
for our purposes. In particular, they do not aﬀect the gradient coeﬃcient of fD,trig, which is what we are mainly
interested in. The corresponding change in the velocity equals

Then, the recipe is to plug δξ and δ(cid:126)v back into Eq. (148) and perform the integration over ξ0, the summation over
ω and the average over the directions of (cid:126)k. Though straightforward, this procedure is somewhat tedious. We note
that the third term in (148) is odd in ξ0 and thus, to the leading order, is zero after integration. To obtain a non-zero
contribution, one needs to carefully extract the ξ0 dependence, i.e., take k ≈ kF (1 + ξ0/2εF ) everywhere. In addition,
the ξ0 dependence of density of states must be taken into account. In three dimensions, and for a quadratic spectrum,
it equals N (εF + ξ0) ≈ N (εF )(1 + ξ0/2εF ).
In order to perform the averaging over angles, we calculate form factors Qmn((cid:126)k) = tr [ ˆ∆n((cid:126)k) ˆ∆†m((cid:126)k)]. For the
odd-parity two-component pairing in crystals with trigonal symmetry (D3d) pairing potentials ˆ∆1,2((cid:126)k) are given by

∆1((cid:126)k) = λaˆkxσz + λbˆkzσx + λc(ˆkyσx + ˆkxσy), ∆2((cid:126)k) = λaˆkyσz + λbˆkzσy + λc(ˆkxσx − ˆkyσy)

(151)

with real coeﬃcients λa,b,c. In hexagonal crystals, symmetry imposes the constraint λc = 0 (E1u pairing) or λa =
λb = 0 (E2u pairing), whereas in trigonal crystals these p-wave spherical harmonics have Eu symmetry. With this
pairing, we ﬁnd for form-factors

with c = 22/21.

We see that, indeed, trigonal anisotropy of Fermi surface and special form of the pairing function lead to the
generation of the trigonal gradient term J5. We see also that, to the leading order, the term J2 is absent. It becomes
non-zero if one takes into account particle-hole unsymmetry (dependence of density of states on energy). This term
is of the order (Tc/εF )2 (cid:28) 1.

For simplicity, we particularize to the case of hexagonal symmetry [i.e. take λc = 0 in (151)] and do not take into
account any fourth-order terms in dispersion relation. The presence of the symmetry breaking ﬁeld leads to the
dispersion relation

To the leading order, the symmetry-breaking ﬁeld couples to the superconducting order parameter, according to

Eq. (23). To ﬁnd this coupling explicitly, we consider the ﬁrst term in Eq. (147), and write (we omit indices m, n)

This term is responsible for the shift of Tc, ∆Tc/Tc ∼ λSB ln ωD/T . This implies that the eﬀect of a strain-induced
Fermi surface distortion (λSB) on the shift of Tc is enhanced by ln ωD/T . The coeﬃcient on the right hand side of
(162) is what we have called δ in the previous sections and Main Text.

Next, we calculate the gradient terms due to symmetry-breaking ﬁeld, i.e., the second term in Eq. (147). Velocity

It is instructive to compare the coupling of symmetry-breaking ﬁeld to the order-parameter and its derivatives. It
is convenient to introduce the coherence length ξ = ξ(T ) and ξ0 = ξ(T = 0) ∼ vF /Tc (Note that here ξ is used for
coherence length). The ratio of the gradient term to the direct quadratic coupling to the order parameter equals

It follows from our calculation that the direct coupling of symmetry-breaking ﬁeld to order parameter is much stronger
than to its derivatives. It implies that the eﬀect of uniaxial distortion ﬁeld is much more pronounced in the case of
two-component superconductors. Indeed, the eﬀect of the symmetry breaking ﬁeld in case of two-component order
parameters is to shift the transition temperature. Single-component superconductors allow coupling to the derivatives
of the order parameter only, thus signiﬁcantly decreasing possible eﬀects of the symmetry-breaking ﬁeld.
