Spectral asymptotics on sequences of elliptically degenerating

Riemann surfaces

26 Feb 2016

D. Garbin and J. Jorgenson ∗

Abstract

This is the second in a series of two articles where we study various aspects of the spectral
theory associated to families of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces obtained through elliptic degen-
eration. In the ﬁrst article, we investigate the asymptotics of the trace of the heat kernel both
near zero and inﬁnity and we show the convergence of small eigenvalues and corresponding
eigenfunctions. Having obtained necessary bounds for the trace, this second article presents
the behavior of several spectral invariants. Some of these invariants, such as the Selberg
zeta function and the spectral counting functions associated to small eigenvalues below 1/4,
converge to their respective counterparts on the limiting surface. Other spectral invariants,
such as the spectral zeta function and the logarithm of the determinant of the Laplacian
diverge. In these latter cases, we identify diverging terms and remove their contributions,
thus regularizing convergence of these spectral invariants. Our study is motivated by a result
from [He 83], which D. Hejhal attributes to A. Selberg, proving spectral accumulation for the
family of Hecke triangle groups. In this article, we obtain a quantitative result to Selberg’s
remark.

Introduction

In the last section of the monumental second volume of Selberg trace formula for PSL(2, R), D.
Hejhal proves a statement that he attributes to A. Selberg, concerning the behavior of the zeros
and poles of the scattering determinant for the Eisenstein series associated to the Hecke triangle
groups GN as N goes to inﬁnity. Namely, for the Hecke triangle groups GN which is a subgroup
of PSL(2, R) generated by the fractional linear transformations z (cid:55)→ −1/z and z (cid:55)→ z + 2 cos(π/N )
for 3 ≤ N ≤ ∞, the parabolic Eisenstein series associated to the cusp at inﬁnity has the following
Fourier expansion

EN (z; s) = ys + φN (s)y1−s + O(e−2πy) ,

where the function φN (s) is referred to as the determinant of the scattering matrix (a 1-1 matrix
in this case.) The behavior for the zeros and the poles of φN (s) are the last two results in Hejhal’s
second volume on the trace formula, with zeros accumulating to the right of the critical line and
the poles to the left of it. The precise statements of Theorem 7.11 and Corollary 7.12 in [He 83]
are as follows:
Given t0 ∈ R and 0 < δ < 1, the rectangle [ 1
and the rectangle [ 1
large.
The latter result appears in the ending remarks of Selberg’s G¨ottingen lectures part 2. Hejhal
also promises to explore more this topic in a third volume on the trace formula, volume that
unfortunately has not been published.

The Hecke triangle groups is one instance of a family of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces which is
elliptically degenerated. In the setting of the Hecke groups GN , Hejhal shows that the Eisenstein
series and the scattering determinants converge through degeneration. Motivated by this, one can
ask questions about the behavior of other spectral invariants such as the Selberg zeta and the
spectral zeta functions, and spectral counting functions, and eigenfunctions associated to families
obtained through elliptic degeneration.

This paper is the second in a series of two articles where we study various spectral invariants
through elliptic degeneration. In the ﬁrst paper [GJ 16], we show the behavior through degener-
ation of the trace of the heat kernel. After we identify the divergent contributions to the trace,
we regularize the trace and produce bounds in both compact and non-compact but ﬁnite volume
settings. Using these bounds, we are then able to show that the small eigenvalues converge. In
this second paper, we investigate the behavior of other spectral invariants as mentioned above.
Among the highlights here is the quantiﬁcation of the rate of accumulation of the poles of the
scattering determinant for the Hecke triangle groups.

We should note that the phenomenon of degeneration of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces has
been study elsewhere. A series of articles are concerned with the asymptotic behavior on families
compact and non-compact ﬁnite volume through hyperbolic degeneration obtained by pinching
geodesics. Articles such as [JoLu 95], [Wo 87], [JoLu 97a], [HJL 97] study heat kernels, Selberg
zeta function, determinants of the Laplacian, and small eigenvalues while for instance [DJ 98] looks
at the hyperbolic degeneration of 3-manifolds. While the methods of proofs in the hyperbolic de-
generation case are adapted here in the elliptic setting, we feel that it would not be mathematically
honest to simply state so without carefully analyzing the details. At the same time, the methods
here are used to give a quantitative statement to Selberg’s remark, which is not present in the
previously mentioned articles.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the setting of elliptic degeneration.
In Section 3 we recall the main results from the ﬁrst paper [GJ 16]. In Sections 4 and 5 we present
the behavior of spectral measures in general and spectral counting functions in particular, the
latter of the two sections containing the result about accumulation of the poles of the scattering
determinant for the Hecke triangle groups. In Section 6 we present the behavior of the spectral
and Hurwitz zeta functions while in Section 7 we study the Selberg zeta and the determinant
of the Laplacian. Section 8 concludes the paper by remarks concerning the behavior for other
integral kernels.

2 Geometry of elliptic degeneration

In this section we will present the notion of elliptic degeneration of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces
of ﬁnite volume (compact or non-compact), having elliptic ﬁxed points. Elliptic degeneration
occurs when the orders of such elliptic ﬁxed points are increasing without a bound. As these
orders are running oﬀ to inﬁnity, their corresponding cones turn into cusps.

Let M be a connected hyperbolic Riemann surface of ﬁnite volume, either compact or non-
compact. For simplicity, let us assume that M is connected, so then M can be realized as the
quotient manifold Γ\H, where H is the hyperbolic upper half space and Γ is a discrete subgroup
of SL(2, R)/{±1}. A non-identity element γ ∈ Γ is called hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptic, if
γ is conjugated in SL(2, R) to a dilation, horizontal translation, or rotation respectively. This
is analogous to |Tr(γ)| being greater than, equal, or less than 2, respectively. Furthermore, an
element γ is called primitive, if it is not a power other than ±1 of any other element of the
group. With this in mind, a primitive hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptic element γ is conjugated

, or

(cid:18) cos(π/qγ)

(cid:19)

respectively. Here (cid:96)γ is the

length of the simple closed geodesic on the surface M in the homotopy class of γ, wγ denotes the
width of the cusp ﬁxed by γ, and 2π/qγ is the angle of the conical point ﬁxed by γ. The positive
integer qγ is the order of the centralizer subgroup of the elliptic element γ. We will say that the
corresponding elliptic ﬁxed point has order qγ.

For a given positive integer q, let Cq denote the inﬁnite hyperbolic cone of angle 2π/q. One

can realize Cq as a half-inﬁnite cylinder

Cq = {(ρ, θ) : ρ > 0, θ ∈ [0, 2π)} .

equipped with the Riemannian metric

having volume form

ds2 = dρ2 + q−2 sinh2(ρ)dθ2 ,

dµ = q−1 sinh(ρ)dρdθ .

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

A fundamental domain for Cq in the hyperbolic unit disc model is provided by a sector with
vertex at the origin and with angle 2π/q. In coordinates, we write {α exp(iφ) : 0 ≤ α < 1, 0 ≤ φ <
2π/q}. The hyperbolic metric on Cq is the metric induced onto the fundamental domain viewed as
a subset of the unit disc endowed with its complete hyperbolic metric. The isotropy group which
corresponds to this fundamental domain consists of the numbers exp(2πik/q) for k = 1, 2,··· , q
acting by multiplication. Let Cq,ε denote the submanifold of Cq obtained by restricting the ﬁrst
coordinate of (ρ, θ) to 0 ≤ ρ < cosh
−1(1 + εq/2π). A fundamental domain for Cq,ε in the unit disc
model is obtained by adding the restriction that α < (εq/(4π + εq))1/2. An elementary calculation
shows that the volume of this manifold vol(Cq,ε) = ε, and the length of the boundary of Cq,ε is
(4πε/q + ε2)1/2. For ε1 < ε2 one can show that the length between the boundaries of the two
nested cones Cq,ε1 and Cq,ε2 is

dH(∂Cq,ε1, ∂Cq,ε2) = log

(cid:32)

ε2q + 2π +(cid:112)ε2q(4π + ε2q)
ε1q + 2π +(cid:112)ε1q(4π + ε1q)

(cid:33)

.

Let C∞ denote an inﬁnite cusp. A fundamental domain for C∞ in the upper half plane is given
by the set {x + iy : y > 0, 0 < x < 1}. A fundamental domain for C∞ in the upper half plane is
obtained by identifying the boundary points iy with 1 + iy. The isotropy group that corresponds
to the above fundamental domain consists of Z acting by addition. As before, let C∞,ε denote
the submanifold of C∞ obtained by restricting the y coordinate of the fundamental domain given
above to y > 2ε. Easy computations show that vol(C∞,ε) = ε/2, and the length of the boundary
of C∞,ε is also ε/2.
Let q = (q1, q2,··· , qm) be a vector of the orders of elliptic ﬁxed points. In this case we deﬁne
Cq = ∪m
k=1Cqk . We similarly deﬁne Cq,ε as a union over the components of q. We say that the
vector q approaches inﬁnity if and only if each of its components approach inﬁnity. Consequently,

the Riemannian manifold Cq (with m connected components) converges to m copies of the limit
Riemannian manifold C∞ as q → ∞. Similarly, Cq,ε converges to m copies of C∞,ε. We shall
write these limits as m × C∞ and m × C∞,ε.

A family of ﬁnite volume hyperbolic surfaces Mq parametrized by the m-vector q will be called

an elliptically degenerating surface if it has the following properties (see Fig. 1):

a) For any ε < 1/2, the surface Cq,ε (with m components) embeds isometrically into Mq.
b) As q → ∞, Mq converges to a complete, hyperbolic surface M∞ in the following sense. M∞
contains m embedded copies of C∞,ε which is the limit of Cq,ε ⊂ Mq. The geometry of Mq\Cq,ε
converges to the geometry of M∞\(m × C∞,ε).

In the above, m × C∞,ε refers to the “new” cusps of M∞, that is, the cusps which developed
from degeneration. In particular, for every q, it is possible to identify points x(q) and y(q) on
Mq\Cq,ε such that limq→∞ dq(x(q), y(q)) = d∞(x(∞), y(∞)). Henceforth, we shall suppress the
q dependence of points which are identiﬁed during degeneration and simply write x and y. The
volume forms induced by the converging metrics also converge uniformly on Mq\Cq,ε, and all such
measures are absolutely continuous with respect to each other. In general, the hyperbolic volume
form occurring in an integral will be denoted by dµ with an appropriate subscript when needed
(for example, dµq). Length measure will be denoted by dρ.
The description of the degeneration of Mq to the limit surface M∞ also applies to the degen-
eration of Cq and Cq,δ (with ε < δ) to their limit surfaces, m × C∞ and m × C∞,δ respectively.

3 Asymptotics of heat kernels and traces

We begin this section with a brief account of the spectral theory and the heat kernel associated
to a hyperbolic Riemann surface of ﬁnite volume. After deﬁning the regularized, hyperbolic,
elliptic, and degenerating traces of the heat kernel, we present a particular instance of the Selberg
trace formula. We end this section, by harvesting some of the results from [GJ 16] concerning
the behavior thorough elliptic degeneration of the regularized trace. For brevity, we only present
these results without proof, referring the reader to [GJ 16] where elaborate accounts are given.

In this paper we consider hyperbolic surfaces having conical singularities (see [Ju 95]), surfaces
realized as the action of discrete groups Γ of PSL(2, R) acting on H. The conical singularities are
present once the group Γ contains elements (other than the identity) having ﬁxed points. Such
is the case with the full modular group PSL(2, Z). In particular, let M be a compact hyperbolic
surface, having n marked points {ci}n
i=1. The Riemannian metric g on M is called conically singular
hyperbolic metric if and only if for every i = 1, .., n there exists a chart (Ui, µi) about the point
ci isometrically mapping Ui to a hyperbolic cone model with associated angle αi. The metric g
induces a compatible complex structure on M\{ci}n
i=1,
provide a complex structure on M . Given such structure, there exist a unique complete hyperbolic
metric on M\{ci}n

i=1 and together with the charts {(Ui, µi)}n

i=1 for which each ci is a cusp.

As the surfaces in consideration have conical points, there is a way to extend the domain
on which the Laplace operator acts so that it is self-adjoint. The Friedrichs procedure is one
such possible extension and we use it here for our spectral purposes. Namely, the domain of the
extension is the closure in L2(M ) of the space

D =

f ∈ L2(M ) :

(< gradf, gradf > +f 2)dµ < ∞ and

f dµ = 0

M

∂cusp

where dµ denotes the hyperbolic volume form and the domain of integration for the second integral
is a horocycle. For details of the above construction we refer the reader to [LP 76], [CdV 83],
[Ji 94], and [Ju 95]. Throughout this paper, we will refer to the pseudo-Laplacian above as simply
the Laplace operator.

Let ∆M denote the non-negative Laplace operator on the surface M . Consider the heat operator
∆M + ∂t acting on functions u : M × R+ (cid:55)→ R which are C 2(M ) and C 1(R+). Then the heat
kernel associated to M is the minimal integral kernel which inverts the heat operator. Namely,
the heat kernel is a function KM : R × M × M (cid:55)→ R satisfying the following conditions. For any
function f ∈ C 2(M ) consider the integral transform

u(t, x) =

KM (t, x, y)f (y)dµM (y) .

Then the following diﬀerential and initial time conditions are met

M

∆xu + ∂tu = 0 and f (x) = lim
t→0+

u(t, x) .

(cid:90)

∞(cid:88)

n=0

If M is compact, then the spectrum of the Laplace operator is discrete, consisting of eigenvalues
0 = λ0 < λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ → ∞ counted with multiplicity. Associated to these eigenvalues there is
complete system {φn(x)}∞
n=0 of orthonormal eigenfunction of the Laplace operator on M. For t > 0
and x, y ∈ M , the heat kernel has the following realization

KM (t, x, y) =

e−λntφn(x)φn(y) ,

(3.1)

and the sum converges uniformly on [t0,∞) × M × M for ﬁxed t0 > 0 (see for instance [Ch 84].)
If M is not compact, the spectrum has a discrete part as well as a continuous part in the real
interval [1/4,∞]. The continuos spectrum comes from the parabolic Eisenstein series Epar;M,P (s, z)
associated to the each cusp P of M . In such case, the spectral expansion has the following form
(coming from [He 83])

Let KH(t, ˜x, ˜y) denote the heat kernel on the upper half plane. Recall that KH(t, ˜x, ˜y) is a

function of t and the hyperbolic distance d = dH(˜x, ˜y) between ˜x and ˜y, so

KH(t, ˜x, ˜y) = KH(t, d).

Quoting from page 246 of [Ch 84], we have for d > 0

For any hyperbolic Riemann surface M (cid:39) Γ\H, one can express the heat kernel as a periodiza-
tion of the heat kernel of the hyperbolic plane. Let x and y denote points on M with lifts ˜x and
˜y to H. Then we can write the heat kernel on M as

KM (t, x, y) =

KH(t, dH(˜x, γ ˜y)).

Denote by H(Γ), P (Γ), and E(Γ) complete sets of Γ-inconjugate primitive hyperbolic, parabolic,
and elliptic elements, respectively, of the group Γ. If M is compact, then P (Γ) is empty. Let Γγ
denote the centralizer of γ ∈ Γ. If γ is a hyperbolic or a parabolic element then Γγ is isomorphic
to the inﬁnite cyclic group. If γ is elliptic then its centralizer is isomorphic to the ﬁnite cyclic
group of order qγ. In each instance, the centralizer is generated by a primitive element. We can
use elementary theory of Fuchsian groups (see for instance [McK 72]) to write the periodization
(3.5) as

Using the above decomposition we deﬁne the parabolic contribution (i.e. the contribution coming
from the parabolic elements) to the trace of the heat kernel by

and in a similar manner we deﬁne the hyperbolic contribution and elliptic contribution which we
denote by HKM (t, x) and EKM (t, x) respectively.

Deﬁnition 3.2. For a connected hyperbolic surface M , we deﬁne the regularized or standard heat
trace StrKM (t) by

STrKM (t) = HTrKM (t) + ETrKM (t) + vol(M )KH(t, 0) ,

where the hyperbolic and elliptic traces HTrKM (t) and ETrKM (t) are given by

respectively. If M is a hyperbolic Riemann surface of ﬁnite volume, but not connected, each trace
can be deﬁned as the sum of the traces associated to each connected component of M .

to show that the two seemingly diﬀerent expressions (3.7) and (3.8) for EtrKM (t) are equal (see
Remark 2.6 in [GJ 16]).

Remark 3.3. In the case M is compact, the standard trace STrKM (t) is simply the trace of the
heat kernel. One immediately obtains from (3.1) the spectral aspect of the standard trace,

(3.10)

The combination of (3.9) and (3.10) represent an instance of the Selberg trace formula as applied
to the function f (r) = e−tr2

and its Fourier transform ˆf (u) = (4πt)−1/2e−u2/4t.

One can use this special case to generalize the trace formula to a larger class of functions.
First, denote by rn the solutions to λn = 1/4 + r2
n. The non-negativity of the eigenvalues imply
that for each n there are two solutions rn which are either opposite real numbers or complex
conjugate numbers in the segment [−i/2, i/2] .
To continue, let h(t) be any measurable function for which h(t)e(1/4+ε)t is in L1(R) for some
ε > 0 . Multiply the right-hand side of (3.9) and (3.10) by h(t)et/4 and integrate from 0 to ∞ with
respect to t. Set

By rewriting the absolute integrand of H(r) as |h(t)e(1/4+ε)t)| · |e−(r2+1/4+ε)t)| and recalling the
imposed conditions on h(t), it easily follows that H(r) is analytic inside the horizontal strip
|Im(r)| ≤ 1/2 + ε(cid:48) for some ε(cid:48) > 0 depending on ε . The Fourier transform of H(r) has the form

H(r) =

with the formula in Theorem 5.1 of [He 76], with χ being the trivial character of the group Γ.

In the case M is non-compact, the regularized trace equals the trace of the heat kernel minus
the contribution of the parabolic conjugacy classes. While the geometric side of the regularized

using integration by parts. Furthermore, for any t ≥ 0, the integral can be bounded as follows

with equality when t = 0. It then follows that the identity trace has the following asymptotics

The hyperbolic trace, the second term in the geometric side of the trace (3.10), has the following
asymptotics

O(e−t/4), at t = ∞ .

For a detailed account of these see Theorem 1.1 in [JoLu 97b]. To continue, the integrals in
the elliptic trace can be bounded as follows: For any primitive elliptic element γ ∈ E(Γ) and
1 ≤ n < qγ, we have

Now for b > 0, the function Gb(t) given by the Gaussian integral

Gb(t) =

is deﬁned for any t ≥ 0. Furthermore, since the limits of Gb(t) at t = 0 and at t = ∞ are b−1 and
0 respectively, the integrals in the elliptic trace are ﬁnite for all t ≥ 0. Consequently, the elliptic
trace has the following behavior

ETrKM (t) =

O(1), at t = 0

O(e−t/4), at t = ∞ .

(3.16)

Putting all these together, the combination of (3.9), (3.10), (3.14), (3.15), and (3.16) give the
asymptotic behavior for the standard trace of the heat kernel in the compact setting. Namely, at
t = 0, we have

The next result presents the behavior through degeneration of the heat kernel and its deriva-
tives. Namely, we have the following theorem. For brevity, we only state the result. For details,
we refer the reader to [JoLu 95] and Theorem 1.3 of [JoLu 97a] which one can easily adapt to the
elliptic degeneration setting.

Theorem 3.5. Let Rq denote either Mq or Cq. For i = 1, 2, let νi = νi(q) be a tangent vector of
unit length based at xi ∈ Rq which converges as q → ∞. Denote by ∂νi,xi the directional derivative

10

with respect to the variable xi in the direction νi. Assume that either x1 or x2 is not a degenerating
conical point. Then

lim
q→∞ KRq (z, x1, x2) = KR∞ (z, x1, x2)

lim
q→∞ ∂νi,xiKRq (z, x1, x2) = ∂νi,xiKR∞(z, x1, x2) for i = 1, 2

(3.20)

(3.21)

(3.22)

a) Let A be a bounded set in the complex plane with inf z∈A Re(z) > 0. For any ε > 0, the

convergence is uniform on A × Rq\Cq,ε × Rq\Cq,ε.

b) We deﬁne Dε,ε(cid:48) to be an ε(cid:48) neighborhood of the diagonal of Rq\Cq,ε × Rq\Cq,ε. That is,

Dε,ε(cid:48) = {(x1, x2) ∈ Rq\Cq,ε × Rq\Cq,ε : d(x1, x2) < ε(cid:48)}

Let B be a bounded set in the complex plane with inf z∈B Re(z) ≥ 0. For any ε > 0 and ε(cid:48) > 0,
the convergence is uniform on B × ((Rq\Cq,ε × Rq\Cq,ε)\Dε,ε(cid:48)).
To continue, let us deﬁne the degenerating trace of the heat kernel. Denote by DE(Γ) a subset
of the elliptic conjugacy classes E(Γ), corresponding to the cones we wish to degenerate into cusps.
It then follows that the degenerating heat trace DtrKM (t) can be expressed as

DTrKM (t) =

One of the staple ingredient in this paper is the convergence through elliptic degeneration of
the regularized trace minus the degenerating trace on Mq to the regularized trace on the limiting
surface M∞. The result below presents a two-fold aspect of this behavior, whose details can be
found in Theorem 5.4 of [GJ 16].

Theorem 3.6. Let Mq denote an elliptically degenerating family of compact or non-compact
hyperbolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume converging to the non-compact hyperbolic surface
M∞.

(a) (Pointwise) For ﬁxed z = t + is with t > 0, we have

q→∞[HTrKMq (z) + ETrKMq (z) − DTrKMq (z)] = HTrKM∞(z) + ETrKM∞ (z).

lim

(b) (Uniformity) For any t > 0, there exists a constant C (depending on t) such that for all s ∈ R

and all q, we have the bound

|HTrKMq (z) + ETrKMq (z) − DTrKMq (z)| ≤ C(1 + |s|)3/2.

Furthermore, one can derive the following bound for the diﬀerence of traces: For 0 < t < 1, there
is a positive constant C such that

|HTrKMq (z) + ETrKMq (z) − DTrKMq (z)| ≤ Ct−2(1 + |s|)3/2 ,

holds (c.f. Remark 5.5 of [GJ 16].)

As a consequence of Theorem 3.6, we have the following corollary, which describes the small

time asymptotic behavior for the regularized trace of the heat kernel.

Corollary 3.7. Let Mq denote an elliptically degenerated family of compact or non-compact hy-
perbolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume which converges to the non-compact hyperbolic surface
M∞. Then for any ﬁxed δ > 0, there exists a positive constant c such that for all 0 < t < δ, we
have

HTrKMq (t) + ETrKMq (t) − DTrKMq (t) = O

uniformly in q.

(cid:16)

t−3/2(cid:17)

Aside from the asymptotics near t = 0, we also need the behavior of the trace for large values
of the time parameter t. In this direction, we need the following deﬁnition and theorem which we
recall from Section 7 of [GJ 16] where all details are presented.

Deﬁnition 3.8. Let Mq be an elliptically degenerating family of compact or non-compact hyper-
bolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume which converge to the non-compact hyperbolic surface M∞.
Let 0 ≤ α < 1/4 be such that α is not an eigenvalue of M∞. We deﬁned the α-truncated hyperbolic
and elliptic trace by

such that the bound

4 Asymptotics of spectral measures

We start the section with some general remarks on the Laplace transforms of a function. This
material can also be found in [HJL 97]. However, to make the reading self contained we present
the material below.

For any function f (t) deﬁned on the positive real line, we formally deﬁne the Laplace transform

and cumulative distribution function to be

(cid:90) ∞

L (f )(z) =

e−ztf (t)dt

and F (t) =

f (u)du.

0

0

The Laplace transform L (f ) of f exists, if say f (t) is a piecewise continuous, real-valued function
for 0 ≤ t < ∞ and for some constants M and c we have that |f (t)| ≤ M ea0t. Then the Laplace
transform will make sense in a some right half plane Re(z) > a0. The inversion formula for the
Laplace transform allows us to write

(cid:90) t

(cid:90) a+i∞

a−i∞

(cid:90) a+i∞

a−i∞

f (t) =

1
2πi

etzL (f )(z)dz

and F (t) =

1
2πi

etzL (f )(z)

dz
z

.

which holds for any a > a0.

Remark 4.1. We will assume that f is such that its Laplace transform exists and the inversion
formula holds. Furthermore, we will need the following basic assumption

(cid:90) a+i∞

a−i∞

(1 + |s|)3/2|L (f )(z)||ezT||dz|

|z| < ∞

where z = t + is and a is some positive number.

As an application of the convergence of the regularized trace of the heat kernel, we have the
following theorem which is analogous with Theorem 2.1 of [HJL 97]. Note that the theorem
in [HJL 97] deals with hyperbolic degeneration whereas the theorem below deals with elliptic
degeneration.

Theorem 4.2. Let Mq be an elliptically degenerating family of compact or non-compact hyperbolic
Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume converging to the non-compact hyperbolic surface M∞. Let f
be any function which satisﬁes the above assumption. Let z = t + is with t > 0 and denote by

(cid:90) a+i∞

a−i∞

NMq (f )(T ) =

1

NMq,D(f )(T ) =

L (f )(z)DtrKMq (z)ezT dz
z

12

Proof. Consider the sequence of functions gq(z) given by

lim

q→∞[NMq (f )(T ) − NMq,D(f )(T )] = NM∞ (f )(T ) .
gq(z) = L (f )(z)(cid:2)StrKMq (z) − DtrKMq (z)(cid:3) ezT

z

g∞(z) = L (f )(z)StrKM∞ (z)

We need to show that

.

(cid:90) a+i∞

a−i∞

gq(z)dz =

g∞(z)dz .

As q runs oﬀ to inﬁnity, using part (a) of Theorem 3.6, gq(z) converges pointwise to g∞(z)
whenever t = Re (z) > 0. Using part (b) of the very same theorem, we also get that the functions
are bounded uniformly, that is

|gq(z)| ≤ |L (f )(z)|(1 + |s|)3/2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ezT

z

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) .

Furthermore, the assumption on f coming from the Remark 4.1 requires that the right-hand
side of the above inequality is integrable on vertical lines. All the hypotheses of the dominated
convergence theorem are met, so that we can interchange the limit and the integration.

5 Convergence of spectral counting functions and small eigen-

values

In this section, we will make use of the Theorem 4.2 as applied to a particular family of test
functions which come from analytic number theory and spectral theory. In this particular case,
the functions mentioned in Theorem 4.2 will be called spectral weighted counting functions with
parameter w ≥ 0. For these functions and their associated degenerating component, we can
explicitly determine the asymptotic behavior for ﬁxed T > 0 and all w ≥ 0.

Consider the following family of functions with parameter w ≥ 0

fw(t) = (w + 1)tw.

It follows immediately that the corresponding Laplace transform and cumulative distribution are
given by

L (fw)(z) =

Γ(w + 2)

zw+1

and Fw(t) = tw+1

respectively. With these remarks in mind, we can now deﬁne the regularized weighted spectral
counting function on a hyperbolic Riemann surface M by

NM,w+1(T ) = NM (fw(t))(T ) =

1
2πi

Γ(w + 2)

zw+1 StrKM (z)ezT dz

z

.

In a similar fashion, we deﬁne the degenerating elliptic weighted spectral counting functions on
the family Mq, by using DtrKMq (z) in lieu of StrKMq (z). By Theorem 3.6, these weighted spectral
counting functions are deﬁned for values of the parameter w > 3/2.

(cid:90) a+i∞

a−i∞

If the surface M is compact, the regularized trace equals the trace of the heat kernel (see the
Remark 3.3). Using the spectral side of the Selberg trace formula (see equation (3.9)) together
with the mechanism of the inversion formula for the Laplace transforms, one can show that

NM,w(T ) =

(T − λn)w .

(5.1)

In the non-compact case, the regularized trace equals the trace of the heat kernel minus the
contribution to the trace of the parabolic conjugacy classes. Using the spectral side of the trace
as given by equation (3.12)together with the inversion formula, we obtain

The next result establishes the asymptotic behavior of the function GMq,w(T ) for ﬁxed T > 1/4

and weight w ≥ 0.

Proposition 5.2. Let Mq denote an elliptically degenerating family of compact or non-compact
hyperbolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume converging to the non-compact hyperbolic surface
M∞. For any degenerating elliptic representative γ ∈ DE(Γq) let qγ denote the order of the
corresponding ﬁnite cyclic subgroup.

provided that T > 1/4. In the case T ≤ 1/4, the properties of inverse Laplace transform imply
that the integral over the vertical line equals zero, hence GMq,w(T ) = 0. Recall that, from the
deﬁnition of the weighted spectral counting function, we know that such functions are only deﬁned
for weights w > 3/2. However, the above formula is deﬁned for any w ≥ 0. This in turn, allows us
to extend the deﬁnition of the degenerating (as well as elliptic) weighted spectral counting to any
non-negative weights w. This proves parts (a) and (b) of the theorem.

To prove part (c), we start by ﬁxing T > 1/4. We note that

e−2πnr/qγ = 1 + O(r/qγ) for r2 ≤ T − 1/4,

elements of Γq, we can write

GMq,w(T ) = cw(T ) log Q + O(1)

(5.5)

as the q tends to inﬁnity. Furthermore, in the special case w = 0, we can apply the mean value
theorem to estimate the integral the deﬁnes c0(T ). Namely, for some value c in the domain of

This allows to rewrite the behavior of the weight 0 degenerating elliptic counting function as

as q tends to inﬁnity and for some 0 < C < 1.

We continue by making the following observation. For w > 1/2, the expression for the weighted

counting function associated to the compact family Mw as given by (5.1) implies

The left-hand side above is deﬁned since, w + 1 > 3/2. It is also clear that the right-hand side
above is a well deﬁned function. This allows us to deﬁne NMq,w(T ) for values of the weight above
1/2, namely,

(5.6)
By repeating the above argument, we can extend NMq,w(T ) to any w ≥ 0. In particular, NMq,0(T )
counts with multiplicity the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator on Mq which are less than T .
With the above remarks in mind, we are now ready to give the behavior of the counting function
NMq,w(T ) for any weight 0 ≤ w ≤ 3/2 in the compact case.
Theorem 5.3. Let Mq denote an elliptically degenerating family of compact hyperbolic Riemann
surfaces of ﬁnite volume. Then for T > 1/4 and 0 ≤ w ≤ 3/2 we have that

NMq,w(T ) ∼ cw(T ) log Q

as q tends to inﬁnity.
Proof. Given any w ≥ 0, the counting function NMq,w(T ) is increasing for T > 0. Choose any
ε > 0. The mean value theorem applied to NMq,w(T ) on the interval [T, T + ε] together with
the diﬀerential equation satisﬁed by the counting functions (see formula (5.6)) as well as the
monotonicity imply

NMq,w(T ) ≤ 1

w + 1

NMq,w+1(T + ε) − NMq,w+1(T )

ε

≤ NMq,w(T + ε) .

(5.7)

Now ﬁx a weight w > 1/2. Then we can write the inequalities in (5.7) above as

NMq,w(T )

w + 1

NMq,w+1(T + ε)/ log Q − NMq,w+1(T )/ log Q

ε

(5.8)

Taking the limit as q goes to inﬁnity in (5.8 ), together with the convergence of counting functions
of weight w > 3/2 (see Theorem 5.1) and the asymptotic coming from (5.5) applied to the middle
term imply that

lim sup

(5.10)

This proves that for weights w > 1/2 we have

lim

NMq,w(T )

log Q

= cw(T ) .

Fix w ≥ 0 and repeat the above argument to extend the result to any non-negative weight w.

Let us continue by investigating the behavior of the counting functions for weights 0 ≤ w ≤ 3/2

associated to the non-compact family Mq.

Theorem 5.4. Let Mq denote an elliptically degenerating family of non-compact hyperbolic Rie-
mann surfaces of ﬁnite volume. Then for T > 1/4 and 0 ≤ w ≤ 3/2 we have that

NMq,w(T ) ∼ cw(T ) log Q

as q tends to inﬁnity.
Proof. We need to show that for ﬁxed T > 1/4 and 0 ≤ w ≤ 3/2 the following limit holds

lim
q→∞

NMq,w(T )

log Q

= cw(T ) .

(5.11)

Recall that for T > 1/4 and w > 3/2, the spectral counting function NMq,w(T ) is given by
formula (5.2). Let us look at the 5 terms that amount the counting function. For the third term
we have that

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) Γ(cid:48)

Γ

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) Γ(cid:48)

Γ

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = Γ(cid:48)(1) = γ

(1 + ir)

(1)

where γ denotes the Euler-Mascheroni constant (coming from p. 114 [JoLa 93b] ). This shows
that this term in the expression of the spectral counting function is ﬁnite and independent of q.
Consequently, the contribution of this term to the limit (5.11) is zero. The fourth term in (5.2)
involves the trace of the scattering matrix at s = 1/2. From [Ku 73], we have that the p× p matrix
A = Φ(1/2) is orthogonal and symmetric. Then A2 = Id which implies that the only eigenvalues
of the matrix A are ±1. Since the trace of the matrix equals the sum of its eigenvalues, it follows
that |Tr Φ(1/2)| ≤ p. Consequently, the fourth term in (5.2) is bounded independently of q, so
that its contribution to the limit (5.11) is zero. The contribution of the ﬁfth term of the spectral
counting function to the above limit is clearly zero.

So far we have shown that only the ﬁrst two terms in the right-hand side of equation (5.2) have

a signiﬁcant contribution to the spectral counting function. To this end, let us deﬁne

(5.14)

Consequently, the hat spectral counting function, as given by (5.14), is increasing whenever w ≥ 0
and T > 0. Furthermore, the hat function satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation as in (5.6). For
w > 3/2, the result of the Theorem 5.1 applies. Fix a weight w > 1/2 and proceed as in (5.7)
through (5.10) to show that

Repeating the argument, but now with w ≥ 0 ﬁxed, completes the proof.

As an immediate consequence of Theorem 5.1 and Proposition 5.2 together with the fact that

these counting functions extend to any non-negative weight, we obtain the following corollary.

Corollary 5.5. Let Mq denote an elliptically degenerating family of compact or non-compact
hyperbolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume converging to the non-compact hyperbolic surface
M∞. Then for T ≤ 1/4 and w > 0 we have that

In addition to this, if T is not an eigenvalue of M∞, we get that

lim
q→∞ NMq,w(T ) = NM∞,w(T ).

q→∞ NMq,0(T ) = NM∞,0(T ).
lim

In the case T ≤ 1/4, the weighted spectral counting functions for Mq in both compact and

non-compact case (see equations (5.1) and (5.2)) turn out to be
(T − λn,q)w .

NMq,w(T ) =

(cid:88)

λn,q<T

The above corollary states that convergence through elliptic degeneration of functions that involve
the eigenvalues below 1/4. Furthermore, the above corollary in implies the convergence of these
small eigenvalues through elliptic degeneration. In particular, if the eigenvalue λn,q has multiplicity
one, then we have

q→∞ λn,q = λn,∞ .
lim

Remark 5.6. We note that Theorems 5.3 and 5.4 present the asymptotic behavior of the counting
function NMq,w(T ) for T > 1/4 and weights 0 ≤ w ≤ 3/2, in both the compact and non-compact
case. These two results only mention the behavior of the leading term and nothing about the
error term. Modiﬁcations in the course of the proof of the two theorems can lead to results
about the error term. To get such results, one needs to assume something extra about the rate
at which ε approaches zero. More precisely, ε should approach zero at a rate that depends on
the degenerating parameter q. A similar situation had been studied in [HJL 97] in the context of
hyperbolic degeneration.

From Theorem 5.1, we have that for w > 1/2, T > 1/4, and arbitrarily large values of the

degenerating parameter q

NMq,w+1(T ) = NM∞,w+1(T ) + GMq,w+1(T ) + O(f (q)) ,

for some function f (q) which approaches zero when q runs oﬀ to inﬁnity. Choose ε(q) > 0.
Applying the mean value theorem on the interval [T, T + ε(q)] allows us to write

19

NMq,w(T ) ≤ 1

NM∞,w+1(T + ε(q)) − NM∞,w+1(T )

One needs to optimize the way in which ε(q) approaches zero so that the amount of error is
allows then for the improvement of the error in the case w ≥ 0.

ε(q)

Using the above remark together with some calculations that had been pointed out by Dennis

Hejhal, we have the following result.

Theorem 5.7. Let Mq denote an elliptically degenerating family of compact or non-compact
hyperbolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume converging to the non-compact hyperbolic surface
M∞. Then

NMq,0(T ) = c0(T ) log Q + O

(cid:16)
(log Q)3/4(cid:17)

Proof. The proof uses two applications of Remark 5.6. In the ﬁrst step we set w = 1. Following
the computations of Proposition 5.2, we can take f (q) = 1. In this case, Remark 5.6 begins with

and ends with

NMq,2(T ) = NM∞,2(T ) + GMq,2(T ) + O(1)

NMq,1(T ) = NM∞,1(T ) + GMq,1(T ) + O (ε(q) log Q) + O

and ends with

(cid:16)
(log Q)1/2(cid:17)

By formula (5.5) together with Theorems 5.3 and 5.4, the ﬁrst two terms on the right-hand side
above grow like c0(T ) log Q .

Example 5.8. Hecke triangle groups Let GN be the Hecke triangle group, which is the discrete
group generated by

z (cid:55)→ −1/z and z (cid:55)→ z + 2 cos(π/N )

for any integer N ≥ 3. The group is commensurable with PSL(2, Z) if and only if in the three cases
when N = 3, 4, 6. In all other cases, the non-arithmetic nature of GN is such that certain precise,
theoretical computations can be impossible. However, the explicit nature of the group theoretic
deﬁnition of GN is such that numerical methods can be employed (see, for example, [He 92]). It
can be shown that for each N , the quotient space GN\H has genus zero with one cusp and three
elliptic points of order 2, 3, and N (see [He 83], [He 92], and references therein). As such, the
results in the present paper apply. Speciﬁcally, Theorem 5.7 determines the accumulation of the
spectral densities as a function of N , a result which is attributed to Selberg (see p. 579 of [He 83]).
In other words, Theorem 5.7 above can be viewed as providing precise quantiﬁcation to Selberg’s
result.

6 Spectral functions

In this section, we investigate the behavior through degeneration of the spectral zeta function
and Hurwitz zeta function, the former being a special case of the latter. After we recall deﬁnitions,
we present the analytic properties these functions posses as well as describe their behavior on a
family of elliptically degenerating surfaces. The main ingredient in the process is the analysis of
the various integral transforms of the trace of the heat kernel that realize these spectral functions.

6.1 Spectral zeta function

Let us assume ﬁrst that the surface M is compact (with 1 connected component.) In this case,
the spectral theory of the Laplacian asserts the spectrum 0 = λ0 < λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ . . . (cid:37) ∞ counted
with multiplicity. The positive eigenvalues can be used to form a Dirichlet series, the spectral zeta
function ζM (s) which is deﬁned by

(cid:88)

λn>0

ζM (s) =

λ−s
n .

By Weyl’s law (3.19), the series converges absolutely and uniformly for Re(s) ≥ 1 + ε with ε > 0 .
Hence ζM (s) is an analytic function for Re(s) > 1 .

Furthermore, we have

The behavior of StrKM (t) at t = 0 and t = ∞ (see (3.17) and (3.18) respectively) shows that
the above integral is deﬁned for Re(s) > 1. Parenthetically, if the surface had cM connected

21

components, then the value 1 (c.f. the zero eigenvalue) in the above integrand would be replaced
by cM . For simplicity of notation, we assume that cM = 1. That said, the above manipulations
show that the spectral zeta function is essentially the Mellin transform of the standard trace of
the heat kernel, namely

Proposition 6.1. Suppose that M is a compact hyperbolic Riemann surface. The spectral zeta
function ζM (s) has meromorphic continuation to all s ∈ C, except for a simple pole at s = 1 with
residue vol(M )/(4π) .

Proof. The proof follows from the analysis of the integral representation of the spectral zeta from
(6.1) above. We start by breaking oﬀ the integral as follows

The second term above is entire. Since StrKM (t)− 1 has exponential decay at inﬁnity (c.f (3.18)),
the third term is also analytic. So we only need to continue the term containing the integral over
[0, 1], which we call G(s). For the latter, we recall (3.18), namely at t = 0

StrKM (t) =

b−1

this term as follows

The ﬁrst term in the right-hand side of (6.5) is entire, while the second term, call it G2(s), is

with the right-hand side being analytic for Re(s) > −n. In this fashion, the spectral zeta can be
continued to all s ∈ C .

If the surface M is not compact, one deﬁnes the spectral zeta by the Mellin transform of the
standard trace as in the formula (6.1) above. Similar arguments may be employed to show the
analytic continuation of the spectral zeta associated to a non-compact surface.

For α ∈ (0, 1/4) we deﬁne the α-truncated standard trace by

M (t) = StrKM (t) − (cid:88)

StrK (α)

With these in mind, we have the following result concerning the behavior of the truncated spectral
zeta function through elliptic degeneration.

Theorem 6.2. Let Mq be an elliptically degenerating sequence of compact or non-compact hyper-
bolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume with limiting surface M∞. Let α < 1/4 be any number
that is not an eigenvalue of M∞. Then for any s ∈ C, we have

and make the following remarks. The volume is bounded by a universal constant depending
solely on the genus and the total number κ of cusps and conical ends of the family, namely
vol(Mq) ≤ 2π(2g − 2 + κ). By (3.14), the kernel function KH(t, 0) decays exponentially as t goes
to inﬁnity, so that the integral over [1,∞) is entire as a function of s. Using the same arguments
as in the course of the proof of Proposition 6.1, the integral over [0, 1] is analytic for Re(s) > 1
and may be continued to all s ∈ C.

can be split over [0, 1] and [1,∞). From Theorem 3.9, the bracket in (6.7) has exponential decay; so
then the portion over [0, 1] is analytic for Re(s) > 0 and may be continued to the whole complex
plane, while the part of the integral over [1,∞) is entire as function of s. By the dominated
convergence theorem, we can interchange the limit and the integral. The proof then follows by
the convergence Theorem 3.6.

6.2 Hurwitz zeta function

23

As in the case of the spectral zeta function, we start in the compact setting where the Hurwitz

zeta function is represented via the Dirichlet series

(cid:88)

ζM (s, z) =

(z + λn)−s ,

for z, s ∈ C with Re(z) > 0 and Re(s) > 1.

The above integral transform allows to extend the deﬁnition of the Hurwitz zeta function to the
non-compact setting.

From Section1 of [JoLa 93] (see also [Sa 87]) we obtain the following result.

Proposition 6.3. For each z ∈ C, the Hurwitz zeta function extends to a meromorphic function
to all s ∈ C.

Proof. Assuming ﬁrst that z > 0 we expand the right-hand side of (6.8) as follows

(6.9)

By (3.18), the ﬁrst term in the right hand side of (6.9) above is entire as a function of s. For the
second term, which is initially deﬁned for Re(s) > 1, we can mimic the ideas starting with (6.3)
in Proposition 6.1 to provide its analytic continuation. The third term is entire as a function of
s. Consequently, these arguments allow to extend the Hurwitz zeta function to Re(z) > 0.

Next, we extend the Hurwitz zeta to Re(z) > −λ1. In this direction, we have

(6.10)

The ﬁrst sum in the right-hand side of (6.10) has ﬁnitely many terms (according to the multi-
plicity of λ1). For the second term, the sum in the bracket has the same asymptotic behavior
as StrKM (t) − 1. Consequently, the second term is now deﬁned for Re(z) > −λ1 and can be
continued to all s ∈ C. The process then can be repeated to extend to Re(z) > −λk, with λk
being the ﬁrst eigenvalue surpassing λ1.

We end this section by presenting the behavior of the Hurwitz zeta through degeneration. For

α ∈ (0, 1/4) we deﬁne the α-truncated Hurwitz zeta function as

With these in mind, we have the following result concerning the behavior of the truncated spectral
zeta function through elliptic degeneration.

Theorem 6.4. Let Mq be an elliptically degenerating sequence of compact or non-compact hyper-
bolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume with limiting surface M∞. Let α < 1/4 be any number
that is not an eigenvalue of M∞. Then for any s, z ∈ C, we have

Furthemore, the convergence is uniform in half planes of the form Re(s) > C and ﬁxed z.

Proof. The result follows using similar arguments as in Theorem 6.2.

7 Selberg zeta and determinant of the Laplacian

In this section, we investigate the behavior of the Selberg zeta function and the determinant
of the Laplacian. After we recall deﬁnitions and some analytic properties of these functions, we
describe their asymptotics through elliptic degeneration. It is worth mentioning that the spectral
zeta, Selberg zeta, and the determinant of the Laplacian, are very much connected. Namely,
the determinant of the Laplacian specialized to s(s − 1) is essentially the completed Selberg zeta
function, with additional factors coming from the volume and the conical points ([Sa 87], [Vo 87],
[Ko 91]), while the spectral zeta function regularizes the determinant product. This comes with
no surprise since the aforementioned functions appear in either the spectral side or the geometric
side of the trace formula.

7.1 Selberg zeta function

The Selberg zeta function is deﬁned by the product

ZM (s) =

1 − e−(s+n)(cid:96)γ

Following an elementary argument (see for example Lemma 4 in [JoLu 95]), one can estimate the
number of closed geodesics of bounded length. It then follows that the Euler product which deﬁnes
the Selberg zeta function converges for Re(s) > 1.

Following [McK 72], the integral representation is derived by carefully manipulating the loga-

rithmic derivative of the Selberg zeta, namely

zeta function can be expressed via the integral

ZM (s)

HtrKM (t)e−s(s−1)tdt .

For α < 1/4, we deﬁne the α-truncated logarithmic derivative of the Selberg zeta function,
using the above integral representation minus the contribution to the trace of the small eigenvalues.
Consequently, we have

As a direct corollary to Theorem 7.1 we obtain the following result.

Corollary 7.2. Let Mq be an elliptically degenerating sequence of compact or non-compact hy-
perbolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume with limiting surface M∞.
(a) For any s with Re(s) > 1 or Re(s2 − s) > −1/4, we have

7.2 Determinant of the Laplacian

For a compact surface M , the determinant of Laplacian ∆M is deﬁned as the inﬁnite product

det ∆M =

λn ,

(7.1)

(cid:89)

λn>0

(see for instance [Sa 87], [Vo 87], [JoLa 93], [JoLa 93b], [JoLa 94], [Ts 97] ). To give meaning to
such divergent product, we observe that if the above product converged, than the logarithm of the
determinant could be written as

− log det ∆M = − (cid:88)

log λn =

d

λn>0

(cid:88)

λn>0

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s=0

λ−s

n

M (0) .

Recalling from Proposition 6.1 that the spectral zeta ζM (s) is analytic at s = 0, the above formal
manipulation suggests that the divergent product in (7.1) be regularized as

det ∆M = exp(−ζ(cid:48)

M (0)) .

(7.2)

26

For 0 < α < 1/4, we can express the derivative of α-truncated spectral zeta function as follows

M (s) = − Γ(cid:48)(s)

At s = 0 the gamma function has a simple pole, so that 1/Γ(s) = 0 and consequently the second
term above has no contribution to the logarithmic determinant. Directly from the Weierstrass
product deﬁnition of the gamma function, it follows that

Γ(cid:48)
Γ2 (0) = lim

The integral representation (7.3) above together with Theorem 6.2 concerning the behavior of
the spectral zeta through elliptic degeneration, yield the following result concerning the behavior
of the regularized determinant.

perbolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume with limiting surface M∞. Let α < 1/4 be any number
that is not an eigenvalue of M∞. Then

Integral kernels

As in the articles [HJL 97], [JoLu 97a], and [JoLu 97b], one can prove the asymptotic behavior
of numerous other spectral quantities having once established the heat kernel convergence (see
Theorem 3.5), and the regularized convergence theorem of heat traces (see Theorem 3.6). For
completeness, we list here some of the questions that now can be answered and, for the sake of
brevity, we outline the method of proof. In the cases when Theorem 3.5 is used, one obtains a
result which amounts to continuity through degeneration.
The resolvent kernel
The resolvent kernel gM (w, x, y) is the integral kernel which inverts the operator ∆ − w on the
orthogonal complement of the null space of ∆− w. In the case w = 0, the resolvent kernel becomes
the classical Green’s function. For Re(w) > 0 and x (cid:54)= y, the resolvent kernel is deﬁned by

gM (w, x, y) = −

K(t, x, y)e−wtdt.

(cid:90) ∞

0

If the surface is compact, we can use the spectral expansion of the heat kernel as in equation

(3.1) to write

gM (w, x, y) = −

(cid:33)

(cid:32)

∞(cid:88)

1

w + λM,n

n=0

φM,n(x)φM,n(y)

for Re(w) > 0 and x (cid:54)= y. From the above, it easily follows that the resolvent kernel has a
meromorphic continuation to the entire plane with poles located at the negative eigenvalues of the

27

Laplacian. If the surface is not compact, there is a similar spectral expansion for the resolvent
kernel (coming from (3.2) together with the above integral representation).

Let 0 < α < 1/4. Then the α-truncated resolvent kernel g(α)

M (w, x, y) is given by

g(α)
M (w, x, y) = gM (w, x, y) +

1

w + λM,n

φM,n(x)φM,n(y).

(cid:32)

(cid:88)

λM,n<α

(cid:33)

It then follows that the truncated resolvent kernel inverts ∆ + w on the orthogonal complement
of the space spanned by the eigenfunctions that correspond to the eigenvalues of ∆ which are less
than α.

With the above remarks in mind, we have the following result.

Theorem 8.1. Let Mq be an elliptically degenerating sequence of compact or non-compact hyper-
bolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume with limiting surface M∞. Let 0 < α < 1/4.

(a) For all ﬁxed w with Re(w) > 0, we have

lim
q→∞ gMq (w, x, y) = gM∞(w, x, y).

The convergence is uniform for x (cid:54)= y bounded away from the developing cusps and in half-
planes Re(w) > 0.

(b) For all ﬁxed w with Re(w) > −α, we have

q→∞ g(α)
lim

Mq

(w, x, y) = g(α)

M∞ (w, x, y).

The convergence is uniform for x (cid:54)= y bounded away from the developing cusps and in half-
planes Re(w) > −α.

Proof. Part (a) follows from the convergence of the heat kernel as in Proposition 3.5 together
with the dominated convergence theorem. Part (b) is similar to part (a) with the addition of the
convergence of the small eigenvalues and eigenfunctions from Section 5.

The Poisson kernel
A Poisson kernel on the surface M is a smooth function PM (w, x, y) deﬁned on R+ × M × M ,
satisfying the following conditions: Suppose that f is a bounded and continuous function on M
and deﬁne

Then the Poisson kernel satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation

M

u(w, x) =

PM (w, x, y)f (y)dµ(y).

(∆x − ∂2

w)u(w, x) = 0

and the Dirac condition

f (x) = lim
w→0+

PM (w, x, y)f (y)dµ(y)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

M

(cid:90) ∞

0

uniformly on compact sets. For a more detailed discussion on the Poisson kernel we refer the
reader to [JoLa 03].

The Poisson kernel is given through the G-transform

PM (w, x, y) =

w√
4π

KM (t, x, y)e−w2/4tt−3/2dt.

We conclude continuity of the Poisson kernel through degeneration. By arguing as in the case of
the resolvent kernel mentioned above, the region of convergence extends to all w ∈ C.

28

The wave kernel
From the Poisson kernel we can deﬁne the wave kernel by rotation of the w-variable, namely

WM (w, x, y) = PM (−iw, x, y).

The wave kernel WM (w, x, y) is a fundamental solution to the wave equation

∆x + ∂2

w = 0.

As with the Poisson kernel, we obtain continuity of the wave kernel through degeneration.
