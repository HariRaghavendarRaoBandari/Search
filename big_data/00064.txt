REGULAR POISSON MANIFOLDS OF COMPACT TYPES

(PMCT 2)

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

Abstract. This is the second paper of a series dedicated to the study of
Poisson structures of compact types (PMCTs).
In this paper, we focus on
regular PMCTs, exhibiting a rich transverse geometry. We show that their
leaf spaces are integral aﬃne orbifolds. We prove that the cohomology class of
the leafwise symplectic form varies linearly and that there is a distinguished
polynomial function describing the leafwise sympletic volume. The leaf space
of a PMCT carries a natural Duistermaat-Heckman measure and a Weyl type
integration formula holds. We introduce the notion of a symplectic gerbe,
and we show that they obstruct realizing PMCTs as the base of a symplectic
complete isotropic ﬁbration (a.k.a. a non-commutative integrable system).

1. Introduction

This is the second paper of a series of works devoted to the study of Poisson
structures of compact types (PMCTs). These are the analogues in Poisson Geometry
of compact Lie groups in Lie theory. In the ﬁrst paper of this series [20] we have
discussed general properties, described several examples, and outlined our general
plan. In this paper, which is self-contained, we focus on regular PMCTs and we
discover a very rich transverse geometry, where several structures, both classical
and new, interact with each other in a non-trivial way. These include orbifold

structures, integral aﬃne structures, symplectic gerbes, etc. Moreover, we ﬁnd that
celebrated results, like the Duistermaat-Heckman Theorem on the linear variation of
the symplectic class in the cohomology of reduced spaces, the polynomial behavior
of the Duistermaat-Heckman measure, the Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg Convexity
Theorem, or the Weyl Integration Formula, ﬁt perfectly into the world of PMCTs,
arising as particular statements of general results concerning PMCTs.

Given a Poisson manifold (M, π) we will look at s-connected integrations (G, Ω),
which are symplectic Lie groupoids of compact type. At the level of Lie groupoids,
there are several compact types C characterized by possible conditions on G:

C ∈ {proper, s-proper, compact},

(1.1)

that is, Hausdorﬀ Lie groupoids with proper anchor map, proper source map, and
compact manifold of arrows, respectively. For example, when G = G × M comes
from a Lie group acting on a manifold M , the three conditions correspond to the
properness of the action, the compactness of G, and the compactness of both G
and M , respectively. Therefore, one says that the Poisson manifold (M, π) is of:

• C-type if it has an s-connected integration (G, Ω) with property C;
• strong C-type if its canonical integration Σ(M, π) has property C.

A Poisson manifold (M, π) comes with a partition into symplectic leaves, gener-
alizing the partition by coadjoint orbits from Lie theory. In this paper, we consider
PMCTs where the dimension of the leaves is constant, leaving the non-regular case
to the next paper in the series [21]. This gives rise to a regular foliation Fπ on M ,
so, in some sense, we are looking at symplectic foliations from the perspective of
Poisson Geometry.

For a general regular Poisson manifold, the leaf space

B = M/Fπ

is very pathological. However, for us, the ﬁrst immediate consequence of any of
the compactness conditions is that B is Hausdorﬀ. Moreover, we will see that it
comes with a very rich geometry, illustrated in the following theorem, which collects
several results spread throughout the paper:

Theorem 1.0.1. Given a regular Poisson manifold (M, π) of proper type and an
s-connected, proper symplectic integration (G, Ω):
(a) The space B of symplectic leaves comes with an orbifold structure B = B(G);
(b) There is an induced integral aﬃne structure Λ on B;
(c) The classical eﬀective orbifold underlying B is good;
(d) There is a symplectic T -gerbe over B, where T is the symplectic torus bundle
induced by Λ. This gerbe is classiﬁed by the Lagrangian Dixmier-Douady class:

c2(G, Ω) ∈ H 2(B, TLagr).

(e) The class c2(G, Ω) vanishes if and only if (M, π) admits a proper isotropic
realization q : (X, ΩX) → (M, π) for which G ∼= BX (M, π), a natural symplectic
integration constructed from X and the orbifold structure B.

The presence of an orbifold structure on the leaf space which, in general, is non-
eﬀective, gives rise to several technical diﬃculties throughout the discussion. When
the symplectic leaves are 1-connected, then B is just a smooth manifold, and no
further complications arise from orbifolds. In this case, all the other main features
of PMCTs are already present, and it includes interesting examples, such as the

PMCT 2

3

regular coadjoint orbits or the principal conjugacy classes of a compact Lie group.
For that reason, in the general discussion we will often consider this case ﬁrst.

The diﬀerent geometric structures present on the leaf space of a PMCT, men-
tioned in the previous theorem, interact nicely with the leafwise symplectic geome-
try. One illustration of this interaction is the linear variation of symplectic forms
in cohomology, generalizing the classical Duistermaat-Heckman Theorem. For sim-
plicity, we concentrate on the smooth case, where the leaves are 1-connected. Then
to each b ∈ B corresponds a symplectic leaf (Sb, ωb), and the cohomologies H 2(Sb)
yield a bundle H → B. The cohomology class of the leafwise symplectic form
deﬁnes a section of this bundle:

B ∋ b 7→ [ωb] ∈ Hb = H 2(Sb).

In the s-proper case, the leaves are compact and H is a smooth ﬂat vector bundle
over B. The ﬂat connection is the so called Gauss-Manin connection and arises
from the underlying integral cohomology. Using parallel transport, one can compare
classes [ωb] at distinct points b ∈ B, once a path has been ﬁxed. On the other hand,
the integral aﬃne structure on B of the previous theorem determines a developing
map, deﬁned on the universal cover of B:

Denoting the Chern classes of the principal torus bundle t : s−1(x0) → Sb0 , where
s and t are the source/ﬁber of the s-proper integration, by

dev : eB → Rq

(q = dim B).

the linear variation theorem can be stated as follows:

c1, . . . , cq ∈ H 2(Sb0 ),

Theorem 1.0.2. If (M, π) is a regular, s-proper Poisson manifold, with 1-connected
symplectic leaves, then for any path γ in B starting at b0 one has
γ∗([ωγ(1)]) = [ωb0 ] + dev1(γ)c1 + . . . + devq(γ)cq.

Similar formulas hold for a general Poisson manifold of s-proper type.

One can also look at volume forms instead. Assume as before that we have
an s-proper integration (G, Ω) of (M, π). Pushing forward the Liouville measure
associated to Ω, one obtains the Duistermaat-Heckman measure on the leaf space:

µDH ∈ M(B).

On the other hand, the integral aﬃne structure on B gives rise to another measure,
µAﬀ ∈ M(B). The classical result on the polynomial behavior of the Duistermaat-
Heckman measure is a special case of the following general result for PMCTs:

Theorem 1.0.3. If (M, π) is a regular Poisson manifold, with s-connected, s-proper
integration (G, Ω), then:

µDH = (ι · vol)2µAﬀ ,

where vol : B → R is the leafwise symplectic volume function and ι : B → N counts
the number of connected components of the isotropy group Gx (x ∈ Sb). Moreover,
(ι · vol)2 is a polynomial relative to the orbifold integral aﬃne structure on B.

The previous theorem has an interesting version already on M , where we obtain
two measures, µM
DH and ρM , which
are invariant under all Hamiltonian ﬂows. Our study of such invariant densities
yields the following Fubini type theorem:

M = µM , both induced by densities ρM

DH and µAﬀ

Theorem 1.0.4. If (M, π) is a regular Poisson manifold, with proper integration
(G, Ω), then for any f ∈ C∞

c (M ):

ZM

f (x) dµM (x) =ZB(cid:18)ι(b)ZSb

f (y) dµSb(y)(cid:19) dµAﬀ (b),

where µSb is the Liouville measure of the symplectic leaf Sb, and ι : B → N is the
function that for each b ∈ B counts the number of connected components of the
isotropy group Gx (x ∈ Sb).

We shall see in [21] that a similar theorem is valid for all, including non-regular,
PMCTs. This theorem includes, as a special instance, the classical Weyl Integration
Formula.

The rest of this paper is organized into 8 sections and 2 appendices.
Section 2 is devoted to foliations and orbifolds, recalling Haeﬂiger’s approach
to transversal geometry, ﬁxing the necessary framework, but also illustrating the
various compactness properties (1.1) in the simpler context of foliations. In this
section, the orbifold structure on the leaf space of a PMCT, stated in part (a) of
Theorem 1.0.1, is shown to exist.

Section 3 includes some basics on Integral Aﬃne Geometry and describes its
relationship with Poisson Geometry. Besides proving part (b) of Theorem 1.0.1, we
discover new Poisson invariants, the so-called extended monodromy groups which
give rise to obstructions to s-properness, but which are interesting also for general
Poisson manifolds.

Sections 4 and Section 5 concern Theorem 1.0.2, on the linear variation of the
cohomology class of the leafwise symplectic form. We ﬁrst treat the case of smooth
leaf space and then the orbifold case. Both these sections start by revisiting the
developing map for integral aﬃne structures from a novel groupoid perspective.
That allows for a global formulation, free of choices, which is more appropriate
for our purposes. We also obtain a decomposition result for Poisson manifolds of
s-proper type which, from the point of view of classiﬁcation, indicates two types of
building blocks: (i) the strong proper ones with full variation, and (ii) the ones with
no variation, corresponding to symplectic ﬁbrations over integral aﬃne manifolds.
Section 6 discusses the Duistermaat-Heckman measures on PMCTs and on their
leaf spaces, its relationship with the measures determined by the integral aﬃne
structures, and the interaction with the Liouville measure on the symplectic leaves,
leading to proofs of Theorem 1.0.3, on the polynomial nature of the Duistermaat-
Heckman measure, and the integration formula of Theorem 1.0.4.

Section 7 explains the relationship between PMCTs and proper isotropic real-
izations, which appears in part (e) of Theorem 1.0.1. For any proper isotropic
realization q : (X, ΩX) → (M, π) we introduce a “holonomy groupoid relative to
X”, HolX (M, π), which is usually smaller than the canonical integration Σ(M, π),
and hence has better chances to be proper. The groupoids HolX (M, π) not only
arise in many examples, but are an important concept. Indeed, recall that folia-
tions come with two standard s-connected integrations: the largest one which is
the monodromy groupoid Mon(M, F ) and the smallest one which is the holonomy
groupoid Hol(M, F ). In Poisson geometry, the integration Σ(M, π) is the analogue
of Mon(M, F ) but, in general, there is no analogue of the holonomy groupoid. Our

PMCT 2

5

results suggest that, in Poisson Geometry, instead of looking for the smallest in-
tegration, one should look for the smallest one that acts on a given symplectic
realization. This property characterizes HolX (M, π) uniquely.

Sections 8 and 9 describe our theory of symplectic gerbes, ﬁrst in the smooth
case and then in the orbifold case, proving parts (d) and (e) of Theorem 1.0.1.
Our departure point, is the usual theory of S1-gerbes, which we ﬁrst extend to T -
gerbes, where T is an arbitrary torus bundle over a manifold B. For the symplectic
theory, we need to look at a symplectic torus bundles (T , ωT ) over an orbifold B or,
equivalently, integral aﬃne structures on B. In the more standard theory ones looks
at central extensions of T by Lie groupoids, while in the symplectic theory we look
at central extensions of (T , ωT ) by symplectic groupoids. The main conclusion
is that, while T -gerbes are classiﬁed by their Dixmier-Douady classes, living in
H 2(B, T ), for symplectic gerbes one obtains a Lagrangian Dixmier-Douady class
which gives rise to a group isomorphism

c2 : GerbB(T , ωT ) → H 2(B, T Lagr),

where T Lagr is the sheaf of Lagrangian sections of (T , ωT ).

Appendix A gives some background on actions of symplectic groupoids, Hamil-
tonian G-spaces, and symplectic Morita equivalence, which are relevant for the
paper. Appendix B is of a very diﬀerent nature: we show there how one can adapt
(part of) Molino’s approach of Riemannian foliations to the context of integral
aﬃne geometry, to prove that integral aﬃne orbifolds are good, i.e. quotients of
a discrete integral aﬃne group action. While this is relevant for PMCTs and we
make good use of it, we believe it may be of independent interest.

As we develop the theory of PMCTs, we will explain how to adapt it to Dirac
manifolds. The ﬁrst motivation for this arises from the extension of the results
of this paper from regular to arbitrary PMCTs, since we will introduce in [21] a
desingularization procedure which will turn a PMCT into a regular, Dirac manifold
(without changing the leaf space or the compactness type!). The second motiva-
tion comes from Lie theory and the striking similarity between the geometry of
(co)adjoint orbits and the one of conjugacy classes (see e.g. [30]). While coadjoint
orbits ﬁt into Poisson Geometry, conjugacy classes belong to the world of (twisted)
Dirac Geometry. Hence the Dirac framework allows us to (re)cover even more
fundamental examples.

However, in order to get a faster grasp of the results and new techniques intro-
duced here, the reader may choose to skip, in a ﬁrst reading, all sections concerning
Dirac Geometry. The same applies to the sections on orbifolds, since the rich geo-
metry that comes with PMCTs is present already when the leaf space is smooth.

Acknowledgments. The work of N.-T. Zung [66] on proper symplectic grou-
poids should be considered as a precursor of the theory of PMCTs. However, Zung
focus his attention on the symplectic groupoid, instead of the underlying Poisson
manifold. A. Weinstein’s work on measures on stacks [64] was a source of inspiration
for our study of measures. Our theory of symplectic gerbes can be viewed as a
symplectic version of I. Moerdijk’s work on regular proper groupoids [51], but with
a richer geometric ﬂavor that includes the connection to the Delzant-Dazord theory
of isotropic ﬁbrations [26]. We would also like to acknowledge various discussions
with (....) and the gracious support of IMPA, the University of Utrecht and the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne, at various stages of these project.

2. PMCTs, foliations of compact types and orbifolds

Recall that given a foliation F on M the associated distribution can be thought
of as a Lie algebroid with anchor the inclusion and bracket the restriction of the
Lie bracket of vector ﬁelds. This Lie algebroid is well-known to be integrable
– for example by the holonomy groupoid (see Section 2.1). Therefore, for any
of the compactness types (1.1), the notion of C-type (respectively, strong C-type)
makes sense for any foliated manifold (M, F ): one requires the existence of a source
connected (respectively, source 1-connected) Hausdorﬀ Lie groupoid integrating F
having property C.

In this section we shall make a detailed study of these compactness types of folia-
tions. On the one hand, foliations of compact types are easier to handle than regular
Poisson manifolds of compact types, but they still exhibit phenomena/properties
that will persist in the Poisson case. Thus the analysis of the former will play a
guiding role in the analysis of the latter. On the other hand, if a regular Pois-
son manifolds is of (strong) C-type, then so is the underlying symplectic foliation.
Hence, the results in this section have immediate applications to the Poisson case.

As (rough) main goal of this section, we mention here:

Theorem 2.0.5. If (M, π) is a regular Poisson manifold of C-type, then the sym-
plectic foliation Fπ is of C-type. As a consequence, the space of symplectic leaves

B = M/Fπ

is an orbifold. More precisely, any integration G of (M, π) of C-type gives rise to
an integration B(G) of Fπ of C-type, which induces an orbifold structure on B.

We shall see in the next sections that symplectic integrations of (M, π) induce
several geometric structures on the orbifold B. For that reason this section pays
special attention to geometric structures on leaf spaces of foliations and on orbifolds.

Remark 2.0.6 (Classical compact foliations). In classical Foliation Theory the
notion of a compact foliation refers to a foliation all whose leaves are compact (see,
e.g., [31, 32]). This property does not refer to any of the integrations of F . We
will clarify later how this classical notion is related to our compactness types. In
this regard, since the pioneering work of A. Haeﬂiger, Lie groupoids (in particular,
the holonomy groupoid) have been extensively used in the study of the transverse
geometry of foliations. Our approach, follows the same spirit, deﬁning compactness
type of foliations in terms of groupoids integrating them.

2.1. The monodromy and holonomy groupoids. The Lie groupoids that in-
tegrate foliations are called foliation groupoids. They are easy to characterize,
since, in general, the Lie algebra of the isotropy group of a Lie groupoid is precisely
the kernel of the anchor of its Lie algebroid:

Proposition 2.1.1 ([24]). A Lie groupoid G is a foliation groupoid iﬀ all the iso-
tropy groups Gx are discrete.

Since any foliation F on M is integrable as a Lie algebroid, it has a unique
(smooth) source 1-connected integration, called the the monodromy groupoid
of F and denoted by

Mon(M, F ) ⇒ M.

The arrows in this groupoid are the leafwise homotopy classes (relative to the end-
points) of leafwise curves in M (see [52]).

PMCT 2

7

Every foliation has yet another s-connected canonical integration: the holo-

nomy groupoid of F , denoted by

Hol(M, F ) ⇒ M.

The arrows are now equivalence classes of leafwise paths where two paths are iden-
tiﬁed if they induce the same germ of holonomy transformation. From their deﬁni-
tions, we have a morphism of Lie groupoids which is a local diﬀeomorphism:

hol : Mon(M, F ) → Hol(M, F ).

(2.1)

The relevance of the holonomy groupoid in studying the transverse geometry of
foliations stems from the fact that any other s-connected Lie groupoid integrating
F lies above it. More precisely:

Theorem 2.1.2 ([24, 56]). For any s-connected integration E of a foliation F on M ,
there is a natural factorization of (2.1) into a composition of surjective submersions
compatible with the groupoid structure:

Mon(M, F )

hE

/ E

holE /

/ Hol(M, F ) .

Recall that we are only interested in Hausdorﬀ Lie groupoids, although even
very elementary foliations can have non-Hausdorﬀ monodromy and/or holonomy
groupoids. Moreover, one can have one of them being Hausdorﬀ while the other
one is not, and even both not being Hausdorﬀ but there exists a Hausdorﬀ one
in between them! The monodromy groupoid is Hausdorﬀ iﬀ the foliation does not
have vanishing cycles [2], but no geometric criteria characterizing the Hausdorﬀness
of other foliation groupoids (e.g., the holonomy groupoid) is known.

Example 2.1.3 (Simple foliations). If p : M → B is a submersion with connected
ﬁbers, then the ﬁbers of p deﬁne a foliation F on M , called a simple foliation. The
holonomy groupoid of F is the submersion groupoid of p, consisting of pairs of
points in M that are in the same ﬁber of p:

Hol(M, F ) = M ×B M ⇒ M,

where (x, y) ∈ M ×B M is thought of as an arrow from y to x. This groupoid is
Hausdorﬀ but the monodromy groupoid of F may fail to be Hausdorﬀ: e.g., the
ﬁber above 0 of the ﬁrst projection p : R3 \ {0} → R contains a vanishing cycle.

Example 2.1.4 (One sided holonomy). On the cylinder M = S1 × R consider the
foliation F given by the orbits of the vector ﬁeld X = ∂
∂t , where f (t) is a
smooth function with f (t) = 0 for t ≤ 0 and f (t) > 0 for t > 0. F has closed leaves
S1 × {t} for t ≤ 0 and open leaves for t > 0. It follows that there are no vanishing
cycles, so Mon(M, F ) is Hausdorﬀ. The leaf S1 × {0} has one-sided holonomy, so
the leaves with t < 0 give cycles with trivial holonomy that converge to a cycle at
t = 0 with non-trivial holonomy. Hence, Hol(M, F ) is non-Hausdorﬀ.

∂θ + f (t) ∂

Recall that the linear holonomy of a foliation F on M along a leafwise path
γ ⊂ S from x to y is, by deﬁnition, the linearization of the holonomy parallel
transport along γ.
Identifying the tangent spaces of the transversals with the
normal spaces νx(S) = TxM/TxS, the linear holonomy becomes a map:

hollin

γ := dxholγ : νx(S) → νy(S).

(2.2)

8

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

It can also be described directly as the parallel transport associated to the so-
called Bott connection. The linear holonomy groups are then deﬁned similarly, by
identifying loops that induce the same linear holonomies:

Hollin

x (M, F ) := Monx(M, F )/linear holonomy equivalence.

Similarly, one can also deﬁne the linear holonomy groupoid Hollin(M, F ). The

resulting quotient map

hollin : Mon(M, F ) → Hollin(M, F )

will factor through the holonomy groupoid, giving rise to a morphism of groupoids
lin : Hol(M, F ) → Hollin(M, F ). However, in general, Hollin(M, F ) will only be a
topological groupoid: it follows from Theorem 2.1.2 that, for Hollin(M, F ) to admit
a Lie groupoid structure such that lin is smooth, the holonomy must coincide with
the linear holonomy, i.e. lin must be 1-1. When this happens, we say that (M, F )
has linear holonomy. As a consequence of Bochner’s linearization theorem, this is
the case whenever the holonomy groups are ﬁnite. On the other hand, the foliation
in Example 2.1.4 does not have linear holonomy.

Example 2.1.5 (Linear foliations). A class of examples that is relevant for us,
since they provide the (linear) local models that appear in local Reeb stability and
are intimately related to our compactness types, is obtained as follows. One starts
with a connected manifold S and:

(i) ˆS → S a covering space with group Γ;
(ii) a representation Γ → GL(V ) on a vector space V of dimension q.
The associated linear local model ( ˆS ×Γ V, Flin) is the foliation of the quotient:

ˆS ×Γ V := ( ˆS × V )/Γ

obtained from the trivial codimension q product foliation { ˆS × {v}}v∈V . Note that
S sits canonically inside the linear local model as the leaf corresponding to 0 ∈ V .
This construction has a groupoid version which gives us an integrating foliation
groupoid for Flin. More precisely, ˆS is replaced by the pair groupoid ˆS × ˆS ⇒ ˆS.
The product of this groupoid with V (viewed as a groupoid with units only) gives
rise to a groupoid ˆS × ˆS × V ⇒ ˆS × V , where Γ acts freely and properly by groupoid
automorphisms (again by the diagonal action). Hence, we have a quotient groupoid:

( ˆS × ˆS) ×Γ V ⇒ ˆS ×Γ V.

(2.3)

One readily checks that this is a foliation groupoid, and that the induced foliation
on its base is precisely Flin. However, this groupoid may sit strictly between the
monodromy and holonomy groupoids. In fact, the monodromy groupoid is obtain
as a special case of this construction:

where π1(S) acts on V via the homomorphism π1(S) → Γ → GL(V ).

Mon(M, Flin) = (eS ×eS) ×π1(S) V ⇒ eS ×π1(S) V,

(2.4)

We summarize the previous discussion in the following result (for item (ii) see

Example 2.2.2):

Proposition 2.1.6. The linear local model Flin is a foliation with linear holonomy
and s-connected integration the Lie groupoid (2.3). Moreover, this groupoid:

(i) coincides with Mon(M, Flin) iﬀ ˆS is simply connected.
(ii) coincides with Hol(M, Flin) iﬀ the action of Γ on V is eﬀective.

PMCT 2

2.2. Foliation versus ´etale groupoids. Recall that an ´etale groupoid is a Lie
groupoid whose source map is a local diﬀeomorphism. Typical examples of ´etale
groupoids include:

• the identity groupoid M ⇒ M of a manifold,
• the action groupoid associated to a discrete group action on a manifold.

The fundamental example coming from foliation theory is the restriction of the
holonomy groupoid of (M, F ) to a complete transversal T (i.e., a transversal inter-
secting all the leaves):

Hol(M, F )|T

⇒ T.

Historically, ´etale groupoids associated with a foliation were introduced via pseu-
dogroups, as the objects that encode the transverse geometry of the foliation (see
Remark 2.3.3 below). The main point about ´etale groupoids is that they can be
handled very much as usual manifolds. The resulting theory should be viewed as
a study of “singular spaces”, namely, the orbit spaces of the ´etale groupoids. The
role of the ´etale groupoid is to provide a “desingularization” of the singular space.

A foliation groupoid E ⇒ M and the ´etale groupoid

ET := ( E|T

⇒ T )

(2.5)

obtained by restricting E to a complete transversal T for F have the same leaf
space. This passage to the ´etale groupoid depends on the choice of a transversal T
but, modulo the appropriate notion of equivalence, called Morita equivalence (see
Section 2.3), this choice is irrelevant. An entirely similar story holds for any Lie
groupoid G, with the exception that the restriction to a complete transversal is not
´etale unless G is a foliation groupoid.

A fundamental property that will be used repeatedly is the following: in an ´etale

groupoid ET ⇒ T , any arrow g : x → y induces a germ of diﬀeomorphisms:

σg : (T, x) → (T, y).

(2.6)

To deﬁne it choose a neighborhood U of g in ET where both s and t restrict to local
diﬀeomorphisms and then take the germ at x of σg := (t|U ) ◦ (s|U )−1.

Given a foliation groupoid E ⇒ M ,

if the restriction ET to some complete
transversal T is eﬀective then the same holds for any other transversal. In such case
we say that E is an eﬀective foliation groupoid. One can characterize holonomy
groupoids as follows:

Proposition 2.2.1 ([24]). A foliation groupoid E ⇒ M is the holonomy groupoid
of the induced foliation on the base iﬀ E is s-connected and eﬀective.

Example 2.2.2. Consider the linear foliation Flin in Example 2.1.5 associated
with a Γ-cover ˆS → S and a linear action Γ y V . A complete transversal to
Flin is furnished by V sitting inside the linear local model ˆS ×Γ V as v 7→ [x, v],
where x ∈ ˆS is ﬁxed. The restriction of the Lie groupoid (2.3) to this transversal
is isomorphic to the action groupoid Γ ⋉ V ⇒ V . Therefore, Proposition 2.2.1
immediately implies part (ii) in Proposition 2.1.6.

2.3. Morita equivalence. Morita equivalence is relevant to our story for it is the
equivalence that reﬂects the “transverse geometry” or the “geometry of the leaf
space”. Let us recall its precise deﬁnition using bibundles [38]. For more details we
refer to [1, 13, 41, 44, 54].

A Morita equivalence between two Lie groupoids Gi ⇒ Mi, i ∈ {1, 2}, also
called a Morita bibundle, denoted by P : G1 ≃ G2 and illustrated by the diagram

is given by a smooth manifold P , endowed with:

• surjective submersions q1 : P → M1 and q2 : P → M2;
• commuting groupoid actions on P of G1 from the left, making q2 : P → M2
into a principal G1-bundle, and of G2 from the right, making q1 : P → M1
into a principal G2-bundle.

Given a Morita equivalence P : G1 ≃ G2 one ﬁnds that:
(i) there is a homeomorphism of the orbit spaces M1/G1 and M2/G2, where two

orbits Oi ⊂ Mi correspond to each other iﬀ q−1

1 (O1) = q−1

2 (O2);

(ii) if x1 ∈ O1 and x2 ∈ O2 are points in orbits in this correspondence, then the

isotropy Lie groups G1,x1 and G2,x2 are isomorphic;

(iii) the groupoid G1 is proper/Hausdorﬀ iﬀ the groupoid G2 is.

Example 2.3.1 (Gauge groupoids). Given a Morita equivalence P as above, the
groupoid G1 can be recovered from G2 together with P and its structure of principal
G2-bundle over M1: G1 will be isomorphic to the gauge groupoid

P ⋆
G2

P := (P ×M2 P/G2 ⇒ M1) ,

the quotient of the submersion groupoid associated to q2 : P → M2 (Example 2.1.3)
modulo the (diagonal) action of G2. The isomorphism is induced by the division
map P ×M2 P → G1.

For a foliation groupoid E ⇒ M and any complete transversal T , the groupoids
E and ET (see 2.5) are Morita equivalent: P := t−1(T ) deﬁnes a Morita bibundle,
where q1 and q2 are the restrictions of s and t, respectively, and the actions are
given by the multiplication of E. This leads to the following characterization of
foliation groupoids, which is a reﬁnement of Proposition 2.1.1:

Proposition 2.3.2 ([24]). A Lie groupoid E is a (proper) foliation groupoid iﬀ it
is Morita equivalent to a (proper) ´etale groupoid.

Remark 2.3.3 (Haeﬂigers’s approach to transverse geometric structures). Let us
call a Haeﬂiger sheaf on Rq any sheaf on Rq that comes together with an action
of local diﬀeomorphisms φ : U → V between opens in Rq; that means that any such
φ induces a bijection φ∗ : S(U ) → S(V ) and φ∗ is compatible with the restriction
maps. More formally, S is a Γq-sheaf, where Γq ⇒ Rq is the Haeﬂiger groupoid,
whose space of arrows consists of germs of local diﬀeomorphisms, with the sheaf
topology. A good example to keep in mind is the sheaf of diﬀerential forms.

Fix such a Haeﬂiger sheaf S. Using local charts, S extends to all q-dimensional
manifolds, giving rise to a functor deﬁned on the category Manq consisting of q-
dimensional manifolds and local diﬀeomorphisms between them. This extension is
unique if we require it to have the same properties as S, but now with respect to
diﬀeomorphisms between manifolds; it will be denoted by the same letter S.

Given an ´etale groupoid E ⇒ T over a q-dimensional manifold, the sheaf property

allows us to deﬁne S(E ) as the set of E -invariant structures on the base,

S(E ) := S(T )E .

More precisely, for any arrow g of E we have a germ σg of a local diﬀeomorphism of T
from s(g) to t(g), see (2.6), and u ∈ S(T )E iﬀ σg takes germs(g)(u) to germt(g)(u),
for any g ∈ E .
In other words, S(T ) is a E -sheaf and S(E ) is the space of its
invariant sections. Moreover, any Morita equivalence E1 ≃ E2 of ´etale groupoids
induces a bijection S(E1) ∼= S(E2), and this construction is natural with respect to
composition of Morita equivalences.

The last property allows us to further extend S to arbitrary foliation groupoids
E ⇒ M by making use of the restrictions ET (see (2.5)). To make the deﬁnition
independent of the choice of T , we deﬁne S(E) as the set of collections

u = {uT }

of elements uT ∈ S(ET ), one for each complete transversal T , with the property
that for any two such transversals T1 and T2, uT1 to uT2 correspond to each other
via the map S(ET1 ) ∼= S(ET2 ) induced by the natural Morita equivalence between
ET1 and ET2 (i.e. the composition of the Morita equivalences ET1 ≃ E ≃ ET2 or,
more directly, the Morita equivalence deﬁned by the Morita bibundle E (T1, T2) of
arrows starting in T1 and landing in T2). With this, it is clear that once a complete
transversal T is ﬁxed, the obvious map S(E) → S(ET ) is 1-1.

Therefore, given a codimension q foliated manifold (M, F ) one can deﬁne the set
S(M/F ) of transverse S-structures on (M, F ) as S(Hol(M, F )). For instance,
if one considers diﬀerential forms on manifolds, the space of transverse forms for
(M, F ) is the space Ω•(T )Hol(M,F ) of diﬀerential forms on a complete transversal T ,
invariant under holonomy. Similarly for transverse Riemannian metrics, transverse
measures, transverse symplectic forms, etc.

One can often remove the ambiguity coming from the choice of a complete
transversal by representing a transverse S-structure directly at the level of M .
For instance, in the case of S = Ω• one looks at the basic forms

Ω•(M )F −bas := {ω ∈ Ω•(M ) : iV ω = 0, £V ω = 0 for all V ∈ Γ(F )}.
Restriction from M to any complete transversal T induces an isomorphism:

Ω•(M )F −bas ∼= Ω•(T )Hol(M,F ), ω 7→ ω|T .

Hence, Ω•(M )F −bas yields a concrete realization of S(M/F ) at the level of M .

2.4. Foliations of C-types. We turn now to the study of foliations of compact
types. Any such foliation has linear holonomy. In fact, we have:

Lemma 2.4.1. Let (M, F ) be a foliation of proper (respectively, s-proper) type.
Then its leaves are closed embedded (respectively, compact) submanifolds, the holo-
nomy groups are ﬁnite, and the orbit space is Hausdorﬀ. If (M, F ) is strong proper,
then the leaves have ﬁnite fundamental group.

Proof. A simple topological argument implies that for a proper (respectively, s-
proper) Lie groupoid all the orbits are closed embedded (respectively, compact)
submanifolds, the isotropy groups are compact, and the orbit space, furnished with
the quotient topology, is Hausdorﬀ (see e.g.
[25, 63, 66]). For an s-connected
integration E of F , the isotropy groups of E surject onto the holonomy groups. (cid:3)

12

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

While strong C-types were deﬁned using the monodromy groupoids, we claim

that the C-types can be checked using the holonomy groupoids:

Theorem 2.4.2. A foliation is of C-type iﬀ its holonomy groupoid has property C.

The proof of Theorem 2.4.2 is deferred until the next section, where we discuss
normal forms for foliations. For now, we look at some examples. One should keep in
mind that a foliation (M, F ) is of compact type iﬀ it is s-proper and M is compact.

Example 2.4.3. A simple foliation (M, F ) as in Example 2.1.3 is always of proper
type, it is of s-proper type iﬀ p is proper and it is of compact type iﬀ M is compact.
Example 2.4.4. For the linear foliation ( ˆS ×Γ V, Flin) the explicit integrations
(2.3) and (2.4) together with Proposition 2.1.6 imply that Flin is:

• proper (respectively, s-proper) iﬀ Γ is ﬁnite (respectively, Γ is ﬁnite and S

is compact);

• strong proper (respectively, strong s-proper) iﬀ π1(S) is ﬁnite (respectively,

π1(S) is ﬁnite and S is compact);

• never of compact type.

Note that in the deﬁnition of C-type one requires the foliation groupoid to be

s-connected. One should be aware of the following phenomena:

(i) If a foliation groupoid E ⇒ M is proper, then passing to its source connected

component E 0 ⊂ E may destroy properness.

(ii) If a foliation (M, F ) is of proper type and U ⊂ M is open, then (U, F|U ) may

fail to be of proper type.

In fact, notice that for a foliation (M, F ) and an open set U ⊂ M , the leaves
of F|U are the connected components of the intersections of the leaves of F with
U . Although the restriction Hol(M, F )|U still integrates F|U , it may fail to be
s-connected. Passing to the associated s-connected groupoid, one gets precisely the
holonomy groupoid of F|U :

Hol(U, F|U ) = (Hol(M, F )|U )0.

(2.7)

Examples illustrating (i) and (ii) can then be constructed even starting from a
simple foliation. For instance, consider M = R2 with the foliation induced by the
second projection and restrict it to U = R2 \ {0}. Then (U, F|U ) is not proper
because its leaf space is not Hausdorﬀ. In particular, Hol(M, F )|U is proper while
its source connected component is not.

Lemma 2.4.1 gives necessary conditions for the properness of a foliation, but

they are not suﬃcient as illustrated by the next two examples:

Example 2.4.5. There are foliations where all leaves are embedded, the holonomy
groups are ﬁnite, and the leaf space is Hausdorﬀ, but are not of proper type:
consider the linear foliation of the M¨obius band M by circles. The middle circle C
is the only leaf with non-trivial holonomy.

Restrict now this foliation to the open U obtained from M by removing one
point in C. In this way, the leaf space remains unchanged, is Hausdorﬀ, and the
leaves clearly have the desired properties. However, the holonomy groupoid is not
proper, as can be seen by considering the holonomy group of the initial foliation,
given by (2.3), and then restricting as in (2.7). From Theorem 2.4.2 we conclude
that (U, F|U ) is not of proper type.

PMCT 2

13

Example 2.4.6. There are foliations where all leaves are embedded, the homotopy
groups are ﬁnite, and the leaf space is Hausdorﬀ, but are not of strong proper type:
consider the ﬁrst projection p : R5 → R and on the ﬁber p = 0 remove the com-
plement of a tubular neighborhood of an embedding P2 ⊂ {0} × R4. The resulting
submersion p : M → R deﬁnes a simple foliation whose leaves have the desired
properties. Since a curve in P2 which is non-trivial in homotopy is a vanishing
cycle, the monodromy groupoid cannot be Hausdorﬀ. However, being an instance
of a simple foliation, it is of proper type.

These examples indicate that properness is more diﬃcult to check directly. The
situation is quite diﬀerent for s-properness and compactness when the local Reeb
stability implies a converse to Lemma 2.4.1. This brings us to normal forms.

2.5. Normal forms. We start with the the standard local Reeb stability:

Theorem 2.5.1 (Local Reeb stability). Let (M, F ) be a codimension q foliation.
If S is a compact leaf with ﬁnite holonomy group, then there exists a saturated
neighborhood U of S and a foliated isomorphism

(U, F|U )

∼=−→ ( ˆS ×Γ νx(S), Flin),

where the right hand side is the linear model associated to the linear holonomy action
of the holonomy group Γ = Holx(M, F ) at some point x ∈ S (Example 2.1.5).

As promised, an immediate consequence is:

Theorem 2.5.2. A foliation is s-proper (respectively, strong s-proper) iﬀ all its
leaves are compact and have ﬁnite holonomy (respectively, fundamental group).

Proof. We are left to prove the converse implication. For that notice that it suﬃces
to check s-properness on saturated neighborhoods, i.e., by the previous theorem,
on the linear models. But this was already remarked in Example 2.4.4.
(cid:3)

Theorem 2.5.2 shows that foliations of s-proper type are the same thing as clas-
sical compact foliations (Remark 2.0.6) all of whose leaves have ﬁnite holonomy.
While the leaves of an arbitrary classical compact foliation need not have ﬁnite
holonomy, one of the main results in the subject states that for compact foliations
the following two conditions are equivalent ([31, 32]):
(a) All leaves have ﬁnite holonomy.
(b) The leaf space is Hausdorﬀ.

Hence, the part of Theorem 2.5.2 concerning s-properness can be restated as:

Corollary 2.5.3. A foliation is s-proper iﬀ all its leaves are compact and its leaf
space is Hausdorﬀ.

What about the proper case? For that we need a version of local Reeb stability
which holds on saturated neighborhoods of non-compact leaves. To achieve such a
“normal form” one needs to enlarge the class of “local models” allowed.

Example 2.5.4 (Non-linear local models). The new local models start with the
following data (compare with the linear local models in Example 2.1.5):

(i) A ﬁnite group Γ acting linearly on a ﬁnite dimensional vector space V .
(ii) A connected manifold P endowed with a free and proper action of Γ.
(iii) A Γ-equivariant submersion µ : P → V with connected ﬁbers.

14

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

The foliation F (µ) by the ﬁbers of µ descends to the quotient modulo Γ and the
new local model is the resulting foliated manifold

(P/Γ, F (µ)/Γ).

(2.8)

The foliations arising in this way are still of proper type. To see this, we exhibit
a proper integrating foliation groupoid. We start with the submersion groupoid
associated to µ (Example 2.1.3), denoted P ×V P , and we consider the diagonal
action of Γ. The action is free, proper and by groupoid automorphisms. Therefore

(P ×V P )/Γ ⇒ P/Γ,

(2.9)

is a Lie groupoid, which is easily seen to be a proper integration of F (µ)/Γ. Of
course, this is just an instance of the gauge construction from Example 2.3.1.

Notice that if one starts with a Γ-cover ˆS → S and a representation Γ → GL(V ),
letting P = ˆS × V and µ : P → V be the second projection, one recovers the local
linear models of Example 2.1.5, together with their integration.

Here is our version of Reeb stability for non-compact leaves of proper foliations:

Theorem 2.5.5. If (M, F ) is a foliation of proper type and S is a leaf, then there
exists data (i)-(iii) as above, a saturated neighborhood U of S, and a diﬀeomorphism
of foliated manifolds

sending S to the leaf µ−1(0)/Γ.

(U, F|U ) ∼= (P/Γ, F (µ)/Γ)

This result is in fact the “improved local model” for proper groupoids of [25],
applied to foliation groupoids. For foliation groupoids however, both the local
model as well as the proof, are simpler. We will sketch here an argument which,
modulo some small adaptations, can be applied also in the Poisson context [21].

Proof. Fix an s-connected, proper integrating groupoid E ⇒ M and let x ∈ S. One
divides the proof into the following steps:

1) Choose a small transversal T to the foliation with T ∩S = {x}. The restriction

E = E|T is a proper ´etale groupoid which has x as a ﬁxed point.

2) For any proper ´etale groupoid E ⇒ T with a ﬁxed point x, there exists a
saturated neighborhood V ⊂ T of x together with an action of the (ﬁnite) isotropy
group Ex on V such that

E |V ∼= Ex ⋉ V ∼= Ex ⋉ TxV.

The ﬁrst isomorphism follows from the linearization of proper ´etale groupoids
around ﬁxed points ([52, Proposition 5.30] or [63, Section 6]), while the second
one follows from Bochner’s Linearization Theorem ([30]).

3) In our case, we have Ex = Ex and TxV = νx(S). Hence, if we consider the

saturation U ⊂ M of V , then there is a Morita equivalence:

E|U ≃ Ex ⋉ νx(S).

4) For a bibundle P that implements this Morita equivalence,

the right action amounts to a free and proper action of Ex on P for which µ is an
equivariant surjective submersion.

5) Therefore, using the gauge construction (Example 2.3.1), E|U can be recovered
In our case this translates

from the groupoid on the right and the bibundle P .
simply into the desired isomorphism:

E|U

(P ×νx P )/Γ

(2.10)

∼=

U

P/Γ

which sends the class of a pair (p, q) ∈ P ×νx P to the unique arrow g ∈ E|U with
the property that p = gp.
(cid:3)

One can recover the s-proper case as follows. Letting Γ = Ex, note that ˆS =
s−1(x) is a Γ-covering of S and that Γ acts on νx(S) via the linear holonomy. One
then checks that P = ˆS × νx(S) is a bibundle implementing the Morita equivalence
between E|U and Ex ⋉ νx(S), giving rise to the isomorphism:

E|U

( ˆS × ˆS) ×Γ νx(S)

(2.11)

∼=

(U, F|U )

( ˆS ×Γ νx(S), Flin)

In this way, we recover the linear local model of Example 2.1.5. We conclude that
the Local Reeb Stability Theorem applies to any leaf S of an s-proper foliations and,
in fact, the diﬀeomorphism (2.11) is nothing but a groupoid version of Theorem
2.5.1 for any s-proper foliation.

Proof of Theorem 2.4.2. We have to show that if an integration E of (M, F ) is of
C-type, then the same holds for the holonomy groupoid Hol(M, F ). It is clear that
such properties descend to quotients provided the latter are Hausdorﬀ. To check
that Hol(M, F ) is indeed Hausdorﬀ one proceeds, again, by restricting to small
enough saturated opens and checking it for the local model (2.8).

If the action of Γ on V is eﬀective, then so is the action of Γ on P ×V P .
Proposition 2.2.1 then implies that (2.9) must be the holonomy groupoid of (2.8)
and we are done. The general case can be reduced to the eﬀective one as follows:
the representation ρ : Γ → GL(V ) has image and kernel denoted by Γ0 and K,
respectively. By construction, Γ0 acts eﬀectively on V . Consider P0 = P/K. Then
the action of Γ on P descends to an action of Γ0 on P0 (still free and proper) and
p descends to p0 : P0 → V . It is clear that P/Γ = P0/Γ0.

2.6. Orbifolds. Proper foliation groupoids serve as atlases for orbifold structures:

Deﬁnition 2.6.1. Let B be a topological space. An orbifold atlas on B is a pair
(B, p) consisting of:

• a proper foliation groupoid B ⇒ M ;
• a homeomorphism p : M/B→B between the space of orbits of B and B.

An orbifold is a pair (B, B) consisting of a space B and an orbifold atlas B on B.

Two orbifold atlases (Bi, pi), i ∈ {1, 2}, are said to be equivalent if there exists
a Morita equivalence B1 ≃ B2 with the property that the induced homeomorphism
on the orbit spaces is compatible with p1 and p2.

It follows from the previous discussion that, by passing to a transversal T , one
can always use orbifold atlases which are ´etale. While nowadays one uses general
foliation groupoids [50], the ﬁrst approaches to orbifolds via groupoids used only
´etale atlases (see e.g. [1]). Although ´etale atlases are often advantageous, restricting
to them is unnatural, not only conceptually, but also from the point of view of
concrete examples. For example, quotients M/G of proper, locally free, actions of
Lie groups come with an obvious choice of orbifold atlas (the action groupoid), but
not with a canonical ´etale one. PMCTs will provide similar examples.

Remark 2.6.2. In the existing literature, orbifolds are often deﬁned as “a space
with an equivalence class of orbifold atlases”, while an atlas is interpreted as a
“presentation” of the orbifold [50, 1]. However, note that:

• two equivalent atlases can be equivalent in many, very distinct, ways, and
• two diﬀerent equivalences give rise to diﬀerent ways of passing from one

atlas to the other.

Hence, not ﬁxing an atlas gives rise to subtleties. This shows up already when
deﬁning, in an atlas-independent way, a morphism between orbifolds, or a vector
bundle over an orbifold. This kind of problems can be solved by developing a
rather heavy categorical language [44]. In practice, we do not have to deal with
such issues and all orbifolds arise with a canonical orbifold atlas, in the sense of
our deﬁnition. Given an orbifold (B, B), it is sometimes advantageous to pass to a
more convenient atlas E: however, such a passing will always be done via a speciﬁed
Morita equivalence QE : E ≃ B.

Example 2.6.3 (Manifolds and smooth orbifolds). Any manifold B can be seen
as an orbifold by using the trivial groupoid B ⇒ B as an atlas. Such an orbifold
is called a smooth orbifold. Note that an orbifold is smooth precisely when
a/any deﬁning atlas has no isotropy. Other equivalent ´etale atlases are provided by
choosing a manifold atlas {Ui, φi}i∈I for B and considering the associated covering

groupoid, i.e. the ´etale groupoid with space of objects the disjoint union`i Ui and

one arrow from (x, i) to (x, j) for each x ∈ Ui ∩ Uj.

On the other hand, for any orbifold B one may also talk about the smoothness
of the underlying topological space: one requires the topological space B to
admit a smooth structure such that, for some orbifold atlas B ⇒ M , the quotient
map p : M → B is a submersion. This condition does not depend on the choice of
the atlas and determines a unique smooth structure on B, if it exists.

Obviously, for a smooth orbifold the underlying topological space is smooth.
However, it is important to keep in mind that the underlying topological space
maybe smooth while the orbifold itself may still fail to be a smooth orbifold, for

PMCT 2

17

the orbifold atlases may have non-trivial isotropy. A simple example is obtained by
taking the action groupoid Γ ⋉ B ⇒ B associated with a trivial action of a ﬁnite
group. Our study of PMCTs will give rise to much more interesting examples-
where the isotropy information is important and cannot be disregarded.

Example 2.6.4 (Classical orbifolds). Originally, orbifold structures on a space B
were deﬁned in complete analogy with smooth structures, but using charts that
identify the opens in B with quotients Rn/Γ of ﬁnite groups Γ acting eﬀectively on
Rn [58, 61]. With the appropriate compatibility between such charts, one obtains
the notion of a classical orbifold atlas. Similarly to the covering groupoids above
for manifolds, such an atlas can be organized into a proper ´etale groupoid whose
space of orbits is B [1, 52]. Therefore, the classical notion of orbifold can be seen as
particular classes of orbifolds in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.6.1. Here, following [1, 50],
we will adopt the following equivalent working deﬁnition: a classical orbifold is
an orbifold for which the deﬁning atlas is eﬀective.

Notice that the subtleties related to orbifolds atlases mentioned in Remark 2.6.2

are not present in the case of classical orbifolds:

Lemma 2.6.5. For a classical orbifold B, an equivalence Q : B1 ≃ B2 between two
orbifold atlases for B is unique up to isomorphism.

Since any (proper) ´etale groupoid has an associated eﬀective (proper) ´etale
groupoid, we see that any orbifold has an underlying classical orbifold struc-
ture. In this terminology, the smoothness of the underlying topological space of
an orbifold is equivalent to the condition that its underlying classical orbifold is
smooth. A general orbifold structure can be seen as a classical orbifold together
with extra data, which is codiﬁed in the isotropy groups of the orbifold atlases.

Example 2.6.6 (Good orbifolds). A large class of examples of orbifolds arise as
quotients M/Γ for proper actions of discrete groups Γ: the action groupoid Γ ⋉ M
gives an orbifold atlas. Orbifolds of this type are called good orbifolds [1, 61].

Example 2.6.7 (Foliations of C-type and orbifolds). For a foliation (M, F ) of C-
type, any s-connected, proper integration E ⇒ M makes the leaf space B = M/F
into an orbifold (B, E). Diﬀerent integrations give diﬀerent orbifold structures.
However, the holonomy groupoid Hol(M, F ) ⇒ M provides a smallest integration
(Theorem 2.1.2), which is proper (Theorem 2.4.2) and eﬀective (Proposition 2.2.1).
Hence, the underlying classical orbifold of any orbifold deﬁned by a foliation (M, F )
of C-type has atlas Hol(M, F ) ⇒ M .

Remark 2.6.8 (Geometric structures on orbifolds). Haeﬂiger’s approach to trans-
verse structures, discussed in Remark 2.3.3, when applied to the orbifold atlases
allows one to consider various geometric structures on orbifolds, such as vector
bundles, diﬀerential forms, Riemannian structures, etc: if S is a Haeﬂiger sheaf on
Rq then S(B) for a q-dimensional orbifold (B, B) is deﬁned by applying S to the
orbifold atlas B ⇒ M . Given some other atlas QE : E ≃ B we have an induced
isomorphism S(E) ∼= S(B), which in general depends on the Morita equivalence QE.

We can now return to regular PMCTs, the conclusion being that their leaf spaces
are orbifolds. More precisely, each s-connected, proper integration gives rise to a
orbifold structure on the leaf space, so one has the following more precise version
of Theorem 2.0.5:

18

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

Theorem 2.6.9. If (M, π) is a regular Poisson manifold of C-type and G is an
s-connected integration of (M, π) having property C, then G ﬁts into a short exact
sequence of Lie groupoids

1

/ T (G)

/ G

/ B(G)

/ 1 ,

where:

(i) T (G) is a smooth bundle of tori consisting of the identity connected compo-

nents of the isotropy Lie groups Gx.

(ii) B(G) is an s-connected foliation groupoid integrating Fπ satisfying property C.
In particular, G induces an orbifold structure on the leaf space B = M/Fπ, with
B(G) as orbifold atlas. The underlying classical orbifold has atlas Hol(M, Fπ) ⇒ M .

Proof. This is basically proven in [51] in the context of regular groupoids. The
main remark is that T (G) is a closed subgroupoid of G. This implies not only that
B(G) is a Lie groupoid, but also that it is of C-type, and in particular Hausdorﬀ,
whenever G is. In our case, since the isotropy Lie algebras are abelian and Gx are
compact, T (G) will be a bundle of tori.
(cid:3)

The reader will notice that the integration in Theorem 2.6.9 does not need to be
symplectic. We now turn to the implications of considering symplectic integrations.

3. Integral affine structure

Integral aﬃne structures form another type of geometric structure that plays a
crucial role in the study of compactness in Poisson Geometry. We initiate their
study in this section. First, we start by recalling some basic deﬁnitions and proper-
ties of integral aﬃne structures on manifolds. Then we discuss transverse integral
aﬃne structures on foliated manifolds and their relation to integral aﬃne struc-
tures on orbifolds. This will set the stage to prove the main result of this section,
which improves on the orbifold structure on the leaf spaces of PMCTs constructed
in Theorem 2.6.9. A simpliﬁed version can be stated as follows:

Theorem 3.0.10. For any regular Poisson manifold (M, π) of C-type its leaf space
B = M/Fπ is an integral aﬃne orbifold: any s-connected symplectic integration
(G, Ω) of (M, π) having property C gives rise to an integral orbifold structure on B.
Moreover, the underlying classical orbifold is good.

For a foliated manifold (M, F ), a transverse integral aﬃne structure is described
by a collection of subgroups of its conormal bundle ν∗(F ), as will be recalled below.
On the other hand, the monodromy groups of a Poisson manifold [18], an invariant
which characterizes its integrability, is another collection of subgroups of ν∗(Fπ).
Another goal of this section is to describe the role of the monodromy groups in
the integral aﬃne geometry of PMCTs. In this study, a new invariant of Poisson
structures, called the extended monodromy groups, will emerge.

3.1. Integral aﬃne structures on manifolds. We will denote by Aﬀ Z(Rq) =
GLZ(Rq) ⋉ Rq, the group of integral aﬃne transformations, consisting of transfor-
mations of the type:

(3.1)
with v ∈ Rq, A ∈ GLZ(Rq). Integral aﬃne structures on manifolds can be described
in several equivalent ways; we start with the most natural one, in terms of atlases.

Deﬁnition 3.1.1. An integral aﬃne structure on a q-dimensional manifold B is
a choice of a maximal atlas {(Ui, φi) : i ∈ I} with the property that each transition
function

φj ◦ φ−1

i

: φi(Ui ∩ Uj) → φj(Ui ∩ Uj),

is (the restriction of) an integral aﬃne transformation. Any chart (Ui, φi) is called
an integral aﬃne coordinate system.

More eﬃcient descriptions are given in terms of latices. By a lattice Λ in a
vector space V we mean a discrete subgroup of (V, +) of maximal rank. We can
always choose a basis {v1, . . . , vq} for V such that:

Λ = Zv1 + · · · + Zvq.

The dual lattice Λ∨ ⊂ V ∗ of the lattice Λ is deﬁned by

V ∨ = {ξ ∈ V ∗ : ξ(λ) ∈ Z, ∀ λ ∈ Λ}.

By a lattice on a vector bundle E → B we mean a sub-bundle

∂

∂x1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b

∂

∂xq(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b

where (x1, . . . , xq) is any integral aﬃne coordinate system around b ∈ B.

Example 3.1.3. Consider an integral aﬃne group, i.e. a subgroup Γ ⊂ Aﬀ Z(Rq)
of the group of transformations of type (3.1). For explicit examples, it is useful to
write an element γ ∈ Γ in split form:

The subgroup condition is equivalent to the following two conditions:

γ = (uγ, Aγ) ∈ Rq × GLZ(Rq).

EZ = [b∈B

Λb ⊂ E,

consisting of lattices Λb ⊂ Eb. We say that it is smooth if, locally around each
point b0 ∈ B, one can write

Λb = Zλ1(b) + . . . + Zqλq(b)

for some smooth local sections λi of E. An integral vector bundle is a pair
(E, EZ) where EZ is a smooth lattice in E. An integral vector bundle (E, EZ) comes
with a canonical ﬂat linear connection ∇: the one deﬁned by the condition that
all the local sections of EZ are ﬂat.

We can now state some alternative descriptions of integral aﬃne structures,

which will be useful later.

Proposition 3.1.2. If B is a q-dimensional manifold, then there is a 1-1 corre-
spondence between:

(i) An integral aﬃne atlas {(Ui, φi) : i ∈ I} on B;
(ii) A lattice Λ∨ ⊂ T B satisfying one of the following equivalent conditions:

(a) Λ∨ is smooth and any two local vector ﬁelds with values in Λ∨ commute.
(b) Λ∨ is smooth and the induced ﬂat connection on T B is torsion free.
(iii) A lattice Λ ⊂ T ∗B satisfying one of the following equivalent conditions:

(d) Λ is smooth and all its local sections are closed 1-forms.
(e) Λ is a Lagrangian submanifold of (T ∗B, ωcan).

In this 1-1 correspondence, Λ and Λ∨ correspond to the lattices:

Λ∨

b := Z

+ · · · + Z

,

Λb := Z dx1|b + · · · + Z dxq|b ,

(i) γ 7→ Aγ deﬁnes a linear representation ρlin : Γ → GLZ(Rq);
(ii) γ 7→ uγ deﬁnes a 1-cocycle for Γ, i.e. uγγ ′ = uγ + Aγ(uγ ′),
We say that the subgroup Γ is of orbifold type if the aﬃne action on Rq is proper
and of smooth type if the action is proper and free. In the smooth case,

∀ γ, γ′ ∈ Γ.

B := Rq/Γ

comes with an integral aﬃne structure induced from the the standard integral aﬃne
structure on Rq.
Integral aﬃne manifolds which are quotients of Rq by smooth
integral aﬃne groups are called complete.

The space B can be obtained in stages. First, the split short exact sequence

0

/ Rq

/ Aﬀ Z(Rq)

/ GLZ(Rq)

/ 0

restricts to Γ, yielding a short exact sequence:

0

/ Γtr

/ Γ

/ Γlin

/ 0

where:

Γlin = {Aγ : γ ∈ Γ}, Γtr = {vγ : γ ∈ Γ, Aγ = Id}.

The translational part Γtr is a discrete subgroup of (Rq, +). Its rank r is called the
translational rank of the integral aﬃne group Γ and deﬁnes a Γlin-covering of B:

Blin := B/Γtr ∼= Tr × Rq−r.

Here are two distinct examples of integral aﬃne structures on the 2-torus. For
the ﬁrst one, we consider the subgroup Γ ⊂ Aﬀ Z(R2) generated by the translations
γ1 : (x, y) 7→ (x + 1, y) and γ2 : (x, y) 7→ (x, y + 1) or, in the split notations,

These two transformations commute and generate the abelian subgroup

γ1 =(cid:18)(1, 0),(cid:20) 1 0
Γ =(cid:26)γn

0 1 (cid:21)(cid:19) , γ2 =(cid:18)(0, 1),(cid:20) 1 1
0 1 (cid:21)(cid:19) .
2 =(cid:18)(n, m),(cid:20) 1 0
0 1 (cid:21)(cid:19) : n, m ∈ Z(cid:27) .

1 γm

Of course, this is just Z × Z with its standard action on R2, inducing the standard
integral aﬃne structure on the 2-torus B = R2/Γ = T2. Note that in this case Γ
has translational rank 2 since we have:

For the second example, we consider Γ ⊂ Aﬀ Z(R2) generated by

0

0

Γtr = Z × Z ⊂ R2.

Γlin =(cid:26)(cid:20) 1
1 (cid:21)(cid:27) ,
γ1 =(cid:18)(1, 0),(cid:20) 1 0
0 1 (cid:21)(cid:19) , γ2 =(cid:18)(0, 1),(cid:20) 1 1

0 1 (cid:21)(cid:19) .
1 (cid:21)(cid:19) : n, m ∈ Z(cid:27) .

Again, these commute, so they generate a subgroup isomorphic to Z × Z,

Γ =(cid:26)γn

1 γm

2 =(cid:18)(n +

The quotient B = R2/Γ is still diﬀeomorphic to the 2-torus T2, but with a new
integral aﬃne structure. In this case Γ has translational rank 1 since we have:

Γlin =(cid:26)(cid:20) 1 m

1 (cid:21) : m ∈ Z(cid:27) , Γtr = Z(1, 0).

Integral aﬃne structures look, at ﬁrst, deceivingly simple. However, even some
of the simplest questions are surprisingly hard to answer. For instance, we mention
here an integral aﬃne version of an old conjecture in aﬃne geometry:

Conjecture 3.1.4 (Markus conjecture – integral aﬃne version). Any compact in-
tegral aﬃne manifold must be complete, i.e. of the form Rq/Γ for some smooth
integral aﬃne subgroup Γ ⊂ Aﬀ Z(Rq).

Remark 3.1.5 (Aﬃne structures). Aﬃne structures on B are deﬁned, via atlases,
as above, except that the changes of coordinates (3.1) are only aﬃne (i.e., v ∈ Rq
and A ∈ GL(Rq)). The analogue of the 1-1 correspondence from the previous
proposition, states that they correspond to ﬂat torsion free connections on T B. In
this context one can talk about invariant (or parallel) densities and volume forms
by requiring invariance with respect to parallel transport of the connection. The
standard Markus conjecture states that a compact aﬃne structure with an invariant
density has a complete connection.

Integral aﬃne structures always admit invariant positive densities (or volume
forms, in the orientable case): one sets µ := |dx1 ∧ . . . ∧ dxq| for any choice of
integral aﬃne local coordinates (x1, . . . , xn). An interesting question that seems to
be still open is whether, conversely, any aﬃne structure that admits an invariant
density comes from an integral aﬃne structure.

A integral structure EZ on a vector bundle E → B gives rise to a bundle of tori
T := E/EZ. Conversely, given a bundle of tori T → B, the Lie algebras of the
ﬁbers give rise to a vector bundle E → B, while the kernels of the exponential maps
give rise to an integral structure EZ on E such that T ≡ E/EZ.

The very ﬁrst indication of the close relationship between PMCTs and integral
aﬃne structures arises from the symplectic version of this correspondence, i.e., by
considering proper integrations of the zero Poisson structure π ≡ 0 on B. Such
an integration is the same thing as a symplectic torus bundle over B, i.e. a
(smooth) bundle of tori p : T → B together with a symplectic form ωT which is
multiplicative in the sense that

m∗(ωT ) = pr∗

1(ωT ) + pr∗

2(ωT )

(3.2)

where m, pr1, pr2 : T ×M T → T are the bundle multiplication and the two projec-
tions, respectively.

Proposition 3.1.6. If Λ ⊂ T ∗B deﬁnes an integral aﬃne structure on B then

TΛ := T ∗B/Λ

is a torus bundle and the standard symplectic form ωcan on T ∗B descends to a
symplectic form on TΛ, making it into a symplectic torus bundle. Moreover, this
gives rise to a bijection:



integral aﬃne

structures on B

1−1←→

isomorphism classes of

symplectic torus bundles over B

Proof. Let us start by remarking that given an integral aﬃne structure Λ ⊂ T ∗B
we have a smooth, free, and proper action of the bundle Λ on the bundle of abelian
groups T ∗B → B by translations:

ξb 7→ ξb + α(b), α ∈ Γ(Λ).

22

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

Hence, TΛ := T ∗B/Λ is a torus bundle. The canonical symplectic form ωcan on
T ∗B descends to TΛ iﬀ ωcan is invariant under this action. For a ﬁxed α ∈ Γ(Λ),
one checks easily that the translation by α is the time-1 ﬂow of the vector ﬁeld Xα
given by iXαωcan = p∗α, where p : T ∗B → B is the projection. Denoting by φt
α the
ﬂow of Xα and by mt : T ∗B → T ∗B ﬁberwise multiplication by t, one ﬁnds that:

m∗

t ωcan = tωcan, φt

α = mt ◦ φ1

α ◦ m1/t.

So ωcan is invariant under φ1 iﬀ it is invariant under φt

0 = £Xαωcan = diXαωcan = p∗dα,

a, which will follow if:
∀α ∈ Γ(Λ).

But this follows from the fact that all sections of Λ are closed (Proposition 3.1.2).
Since ωcan ∈ Ω2(T ∗B) is multiplicative, the same holds for the induced symplectic
form ωTΛ ∈ Ω2(TΛ). We conclude that (TΛ, ωTΛ) is a symplectic torus bundle.

Conversely, let (T , ωT ) be a symplectic torus bundle over B. It is a s-connected
integration of the zero Poisson structure on B. Since the Weinstein groupoid of
(B, 0) is (T ∗B, ωcan), it follows that there is a morphism of symplectic groupoids:

q : (T ∗B, ωcan) → (T , ωT ),

b B → Tb, so its kernel is a lattice Λb ∈ T ∗

which is a local diﬀeomorphism. The restriction of q to a ﬁber gives a Lie group
covering q : T ∗
b B. Since q is a local
diﬀeomorphism, for each α0 ∈ Λb0 there exists a unique smooth local section α ∈
Γ(T ∗B) such that α(b0) = α0 and α(b) ∈ Λb. It follows that Λ ⊂ T ∗B is smooth.
We conclude that the map q factors through an isomorphism:

(T ∗B, ωcan)

q

(TΛ, ωTΛ)

/ (T , ωT )

8qqqqqqqqqq

∼=

This shows that ωcan descends to T ∗B/Λ, i.e., that is invariant under the action of
Λ. As in the ﬁrst part of the proof, then every section of Λ is closed, so Λ is an
integral aﬃne structure on B, by Proposition 3.1.2.

To complete the proof it remains to show that if Λ1, Λ2 ⊂ T ∗B are any integral
aﬃne structures and there is an isomorphism of symplectic torus bundle covering
the identity, φ : (TΛ1 , ωTΛ1
), then Λ1 = Λ2. For that, observe that
any such (possibly, non-symplectic) isomorphism, being continuous and additive on
the ﬁbers, must be induced by a bundle map ˆφ : T ∗B → T ∗B of the form:

) → (TΛ2 , ωTΛ2

ˆφ : (b, α) 7→ (b, Ab(α)),

(b ∈ B),

where Ab : T ∗
b B are linear isomorphisms with Ab(Λ1) = Λ2. To see that
Ab =Id, so that Λ1 = Λ2, one now uses that φ preserves the symplectic forms. (cid:3)

b B → T ∗

Integral aﬃne structures are very closely related to Lagrangian ﬁbrations. In-
deed, any symplectic torus bundle ﬁbers in a Lagrangian way over its base. Con-
versely, if q : (X, ΩX ) → B is a Lagrangian ﬁbration with compact, connected
ﬁbers, then B has an induced integral aﬃne structure ΛX given by:

(3.3)
αX denotes the ﬂow of the vector ﬁeld αX on the ﬁber q−1(x) deﬁned by:

αX = id},

ΛX,x := {α ∈ T ∗

x B : φ1

where φt

iαX ΩX = q∗α.

We now give a Poisson geometric interpretation of this construction, which will
serve as inspiration later on. First, the Lagrangian ﬁbration condition is equivalent
to the fact that

q : (X, ΩX ) → (B, 0).

is a Poisson map into B with the zero Poisson structure π ≡ 0, i.e. that (X, ΩX ) is
a symplectic realization of the Poisson manifold (B, 0). By the general properties
of symplectic realizations [18] (see also Section 7.1 below), it follows that the Lie
algebroid and the canonical integration act on the realization. In our case the Lie
algebroid is T ∗B with the zero bracket and anchor (hence just a bundle of abelian
Lie algebras) and the induced action on X is

σ : Ω1(B) → X(X), α 7→ αX .

The canonical integration is the symplectic groupoid (T ∗B, ωcan), where T ∗B is
viewed now as a bundle of abelian Lie groups, and the integration of the inﬁnitesimal
action σ is the groupoid action:

(X, ΩX ),

α · u := φ1

αX (u).

(T ∗B, ωcan)

u❦❦❦❦❦❦❦❦❦❦❦❦❦❦❦

(B, 0)

This action is locally free. Moreover, it is symplectic in the sense that (compare
with (3.2) and with Appendix A.1):

m∗(ΩX ) = pr∗

1(ωcan) + pr∗

2(ΩX ),

where m : T ∗B ×B X → X is the action and pri are the projections.

Now the lattice (3.3) is precisely the isotropy of this action. Hence the corre-
sponding symplectic torus bundle T = T ∗B/ΛX , a symplectic groupoid integrating
(B, 0), arises as the quotient of T ∗B which acts freely on X:

(T , ωT )

The action is still symplectic, hence q : X → B is a symplectic principal T -bundle,
or a free Hamiltonian T -space (see Appendix A). Conversely, any such symplectic
principal bundle is a Lagrangian ﬁbration with compact, connected, ﬁbers:

Proposition 3.1.7. Any Lagrangian ﬁbration q : (X, ΩX ) → B with compact
and connected ﬁbers induces an integral aﬃne structure Λ on B, yielding a proper
integration of (B, 0), i.e. a symplectic torus bundle TΛ over B, for which it becomes
a symplectic principal TΛ-bundle.

Conversely, for any symplectic torus bundle TΛ over B, a symplectic principal
TΛ-bundle q : (X, ΩX ) → B is a Lagrangian ﬁbration with compact, connected
ﬁbers, inducing the integral aﬃne structure Λ.

A classical result due to Duistermaat [28] shows that Lagrangian ﬁbrations with
compact, connected ﬁbers, are classiﬁed by the integral aﬃne structure Λ and the
Lagrangian Chern class. This will be recalled and generalized in Section 8.1.

3.2. Integral aﬃne structures on orbifolds and foliations. We deﬁne integral
aﬃne structures on orbifolds following Haeﬂiger’s approach (see Remark 2.6.8):

Deﬁnition 3.2.1. An integral aﬃne structure on a orbifold (B, B) is an
integral aﬃne structure on the base of some ´etale orbifold atlas E ⇒ T which is
invariant under the action (2.6) by elements of E .

This deﬁnition only uses the linear part of the action (2.6), so an integral aﬃne
structure on an orbifold is the same things as one on its underlying classical orbifold.
For this reason, the Morita equivalence QE : E ≃ B plays here no role (see Lemma
2.6.5): any Morita equivalence between two atlases allows us to move an invariant
integral aﬃne structure from one base to the other (pull-back to the bibundle, then
push forward by the obvious quotient operation), and the result does not depend
on the choice of equivalence.

Example 3.2.2. If Γ ⊂ Aﬀ Z(Rq) is an integral aﬃne group of orbifold type (see
the previous example) then B = Rq/Γ will inherit the structure of integral aﬃne
orbifold. As a baby illustration, consider the subgroup Γ ⊂ Aﬀ Z(R) generated by

γ1(x) = −x + 1, γ2(x) = −x.

As an abstract group, Γ is the free group in two generators γ1 and γ2 subject to
the relations γ2

2 = 1, so that:

1 = γ2

Γ ∼= Z2 ⋆ Z2,

Γtr = {(0, 0)}, Γlin = {Id, −Id}.

The action of Γ on R is proper and the only x ∈ R with non-trivial isotropy group
are x = n

2 with n ∈ Z, in which case we ﬁnd:

Γ n

2

= {1, (γ1γ2)n−1γ1} ∼= Z2.

The quotient B = R/Γ = S1/Z2 is, topologically, just [0, 1]. This gives the interval
[0, 1] the structure of an integral aﬃne orbifold.

To represent the integral aﬃne structure in arbitrary, possibly non-´etale, orbifold
atlases, we need the notion of transverse integral aﬃne structure. Recall that for
a foliation (M, F ) of codimension q a foliation atlas {(Ui, φi) : i ∈ I} is an open
cover {Ui : i ∈ I} of M together with submersions φ : Ui → Rq whose ﬁbers are
the plaques of F in Ui.

Deﬁnition 3.2.3. A transverse integral aﬃne structure on a foliation (M, F )
of codimension q is a choice of a maximal foliation atlas {(Ui, φi) : i ∈ I} with the
property that each transition function

φj ◦ φ−1

i

: φi(Ui ∩ Uj) → φj(Ui ∩ Uj),

is (the restriction of) an integral aﬃne transformation in Aﬀ Z(Rq) = GLq(Z) ⋉ Rq.
A chart (Ui, φi) is called a transverse integral aﬃne coordinate system.

More eﬃcient descriptions of transverse integral aﬃne structure can be given in
terms of lattices: there is an analogue of Proposition 3.1.2 where the lattices now live
in the normal/conormal bundle to the foliation. The most useful characterization
for us will be the one in terms of the conormal bundle ν∗(F ) = (T F )o ⊂ T ∗M ,
which we state as follows:

PMCT 2

25

Proposition 3.2.4. If (M, F ) is a foliation of codimension q, there a 1-1 corre-
spondence between:

(i) A transverse integral aﬃne atlas {(Ui, φi) : i ∈ I} on (M, F );
(ii) A lattice Λ ⊂ ν∗(F ) which is a Lagrangian submanifold of (T ∗M, ωcan);
(iii) A lattice Λ ⊂ ν∗(F ) locally spanned by q closed, F -basic, 1-forms on M .
In this 1-1 correspondence, Λ is given by:

Λx := Z dx1|x + · · · + Z dxq|x ,

where (x1, . . . , xq) is any transverse integral aﬃne coordinate system around x ∈ M .

Since basic forms are determined by their restriction to complete transversals,
we deduce that a transverse integral aﬃne structure on (M, F ) is the same thing
as the choice of a holonomy invariant integral aﬃne structure on a (any) complete
transversal. This relates Deﬁnition 3.2.3 to Haeﬂiger’s approach (Remark 2.3.3).

Example 3.2.5 (Simple foliations). If (M, F ) is simple, then transverse integral
aﬃne structures on F are in 1-1 correspondence with integral aﬃne structures on
the smooth manifold B = M/F . In terms of lattices, they are related via pullback
by p : M → B.

Example 3.2.6 (Orbifolds). For foliations (M, F ) of proper type we know that the
leaf space B = M/F is an orbifold (see Example 2.6.7). We now have a bijection

Strictly speaking, one has several orbifold structures on B, one for each proper
s-connected integration E of F . However, as we remarked before, the notion of
integral aﬃne structure only depends on the underlying classical orbifold.

Starting with an arbitrary orbifold B, the previous example is relevant to the
way one can represent integral aﬃne structures on B with respect to arbitrary
orbifold atlases E ⇒ M (not necessarily ´etale ones). While in this case E may
have disconnected s-ﬁbers, we have to consider transverse integral aﬃne structures
Λ for the foliation F induced by E on M which satisfy the extra-condition that
Λ is invariant with respect to the induced action of E on ν∗(F ) (of course, this
condition is superﬂuous if E is s-connected). Such Λs will be called E-invariant
(transverse) integral aﬃne.

Example 3.2.7 (Linear foliations). Let ˆS → S be a Γ-cover of a manifold S and let
(V, VZ) be an integral vector space. If ρ : Γ → GLVZ (V ) is an linear representation
that preserves the lattice, then the linear foliation ( ˆS ×Γ V, Flin) (see Example 2.1.5)
has a transverse integral aﬃne structure.

The analogue of the relationship between integral aﬃne structures and the zero-
Poisson structure (Proposition 3.1.6) holds for transverse integral aﬃne structures,
provided one allows for Dirac structures into the picture. Let (M, F ) be a foli-
ation with a transverse integral aﬃne structure Λ ⊂ ν∗(F ). Since Λ ⊂ T ∗M is
Lagrangian, the pullback to ν∗(F ) of the canonical symplectic form ωcan gives rise
to a presymplectic torus bundle

(TΛ = ν∗(F )/Λ, ωT ).

In general, by a presymplectic torus bundle over a manifold M we mean
a bundle of tori p : T → M together with a closed 2-form ωT ∈ Ω2(T ) which is
multiplicative and satisﬁes the non-degeneracy condition

For presymplectic torus bundles one has the following analogue of Proposition 3.1.6:

Ker(ωT ) ∩ Ker(dp) = {0}.

Proposition 3.2.8. The correspondence (F , Λ) 7→ (TΛ, ωT ) deﬁnes a bijection:

(cid:26) transverse integral aﬃne
foliations (F , Λ) on M (cid:27) 1−1←→(cid:26) isomorphism classes of presymplectic

torus bundles (T , ωT ) over M

(cid:27)

Proof. We need to show that a presymplectic torus bundle deﬁnes a foliation F
with a transverse integral aﬃne structure Λ. Let us mention the main changes in
the arguments of the proof of Proposition 3.1.6

For a vector bundle E → M , closed multiplicative 2-forms on E, where multi-

plicativity is with respect to ﬁberwise addition, are necessarily of type

ωσ = σ∗(ωcan),

for some vector bundle map σ : E → T ∗M . This follows, e.g., from the integrability
result of [11] applied to E, viewed as a presymplectic groupoid. Hence, if (T , ωT )
is a presymplectic torus bundle, and we apply this result to the bundle t → M
consisting of the Lie algebras of the ﬁbers of T , we ﬁnd that:

exp∗(ωT ) = ωσ,

for some σ : t → T ∗M , where exp : t → T denotes the ﬁberwise exponential map.
The non degeneracy condition continues to hold for the pull-back ωσ and when
applied at elements 0x ∈ tx implies that σ must be injective. Hence, there is a
distribution F ⊂ T M such that

Im(σ) = (T M/F )∗ = ν∗(F ).

The lattice Λt := ker(exp) ⊂ t will be moved by σ into a lattice Λ ⊂ ν∗(F ). We
have the extra-information that ωσ descends to T = t/Λt; then, as in the proof of
Proposition 3.1.6, this will imply that all the (local) sections of Λ must be closed.
In turn, this implies also that F is integrable and then that Λ is indeed a transverse
integral aﬃne structure for the foliation F . The rest of the arguments continue as
for Proposition 3.1.6.
(cid:3)

Example 3.2.9. Assume that (M, F ) is a simple foliation, as in Example 3.2.5,
and Λ is a transversely aﬃne structure that comes from an integral aﬃne structure
ΛB on the leaf space B = M/F . Then we have the presymplectic torus bundle
) → B. The foliation
(TΛ, ωTΛ) → M and the symplectic torus bundle (TΛB , ωTΛB
deﬁned by Ker(ωTΛ) on TΛ is simple as well, and its leaf space is precisely TΛB . In
other words, we have TΛ = p∗TΛB and ωTΛ = p∗ωTΛB
, where p : M → B is the
projection onto the leaf space.

For the analogue of Proposition 3.1.7 one replaces the Lagrangian ﬁbrations by
the symplectically complete isotropic ﬁbrations of Dazord-Delzant [26]. This will
be discussed in detail in Section 7.

The presymplectic torus bundle (TΛ, ωT ) is also relevant for the integration of
the Dirac structure LF associated with a foliation F and understanding its C-type.

PMCT 2

27

Recall that this Dirac structure is deﬁned by

LF := F ⊕ ν∗(F ) ⊂ T M ⊕ T ∗M,

and has presymplectic leaves consisting of the leaves of F equipped with the zero-
presymplectic form. We have an exact sequence of Lie algebroids

0

/ ν∗(F )

/ LF

/ F

/ 0 ,

which leads to explicit integrations of LF . One such integration is obtained by
observing that the linear holonomy action of Hol(M, F ) on ν∗(F ) descends to an
action on TΛ, so one obtains a groupoid

TΛ ⋊⋉ Hol(M, F ) ⇒ M,

where an arrow (λ, γ) consists of γ ∈ Hol(M, F ) and λ ∈ TΛ,γ(0), and

s(λ, γ) = s(γ),

t(λ, γ) = t(γ),

(λ, γ) · (λ′, γ′) = (λ · hollin

γ (λ′), γ · γ′).

(3.4)

Together with the pull-back of ωT , this becomes a presymplectic groupoid integrat-
ing LF . It is of C-type if F is of C-type.

3.3. From PMCTs to integral aﬃne structures. We are now ready to describe
the transverse integral aﬃne structure associated with a PMCT, a fundamental
geometric structure associated with such a of Poisson manifold.

If (G, Ω) is a proper integration of (M, π), then for any x ∈ M :
(i) the isotropy Lie group Gx is a compact Lie group with abelian isotropy Lie

algebra gx, hence the kernel of the exponential deﬁnes a lattice

ΛG,x := Ker(expgx) ⊂ gx.

(ii) the symplectic form Ω induces an identiﬁcation between the Lie algebroid

A(G) := Ker ds and T ∗M , which identiﬁes gx with the conormal direction:

vx 7→ (ivx Ω)|TxM
Putting (i) and (ii) together, we obtain lattices ΛG,x ⊂ ν∗

x(Fπ),

gx ∼= ν∗

x(Fπ), and we set:

ΛG := [x∈M

ΛG,x ⊂ ν∗(Fπ).

An alternative description can be obtained by considering the torus bundle T (G)
made of the identity components of the isotropy groups (see Theorem 2.6.9), to-
gether with the restriction of Ω. It is a presymplectic torus bundle so one can apply
Proposition 3.2.8 to obtain ΛG.

The relationship between these two approaches will be clear in the proof of the

following basic result:

Theorem 3.3.1. For each proper integration (G, Ω) of a regular Poisson mani-
fold (M, π) of proper type, ΛG deﬁnes a transverse integral aﬃne structure on the
symplectic foliation Fπ.

x(Fπ) = (TxFπ)0 = Ker(π♯

Proof. To show that ΛG is smooth we describe the lattices ΛG,x ⊂ ν∗
x(Fπ) as follows.
Each α ∈ ν∗
x) corresponds to a right-invariant vector
ﬁeld Xα tangent to the isotropy group Gx. By restricting Xα to G0
x, the connected
component of the identity of Gx, we obtain an action of the bundle of abelian Lie

implies that this action can be integrated to an action of the bundle of Lie groups
(ν∗(Fπ), +) on T (G):

α · g := φ1

Xα (g),

(α ∈ (TxFπ)0, g ∈ G0

x),

where φτ
identify ΛG with the kernel of this action:

Xα denotes the ﬂow of Xα. Note that expgx(α) = φ1

Xα (1x), so we can

ΛG,x = {α ∈ ν∗

x(Fπ) : φ1

Xα = id}.

This action is locally free, since the map α 7→ Xα is injective. This action is
transitive on the ﬁbers, since α 7→ Xα|1x ∈ T1xGx is onto. It follows that the kernel
of the action ΛG is a smooth sub-bundle whose ﬁbers ΛG,x are lattices in ν∗
x(Fπ).
In order to show that ΛG ⊂ T ∗M is a Lagrangian submanifold, note that
dim ΛG = dim M = 1/2 dim(T ∗M ) so we only need to check that ωcan|ΛG = 0.
By the fundamental property of ωcan, for any 1-form α : M → T ∗M we have:

α∗ωcan = dα.

Hence, it is enough to show that any 1-form α ∈ Γ(ΛG|U ), deﬁned on some open set
U ⊂ M , is closed. To see this, observe that the associated vector ﬁeld Xα satisﬁes:

iXαΩ = t∗α.

In fact, both sides are right invariant 1-forms and they coincide at the the identity
section. Hence, when αx ∈ ΛG,x we ﬁnd that:

where we use t◦φτ

Xα = t. Since t is a submersion we obtain, as claimed, dα = 0. (cid:3)

Using Theorem 2.6.9 and Example 3.2.6 we deduce:

Corollary 3.3.2. Any s-connected, proper integration (G, Ω) of a regular Poisson
manifold (M, π) induces an integral aﬃne orbifold structure on the leaf space M/Fπ.

Remark 3.3.3 (Twisted Dirac structures). The previous discussion extends to the
Dirac case word by word. If (M, L, φ) is a regular φ-twisted Dirac manifold, then a
proper presymplectic integration (G, Ω, φ) of (M, L, φ) deﬁnes a transverse integral
aﬃne structure ΛG ⊂ ν∗(FL). The reason is that the constraints on the kernel of
Ω imply that its restriction to T (G) still yields a presymplectic torus bundle.

For an s-proper, twisted presymplectic groupoid with smooth leaf space B, Zung
[66] described the integral aﬃne structure on B by very diﬀerent means. Our
approach, using transverse integral aﬃne structures, allow us to deal with non-
smooth leaf spaces as discussed in Example 3.2.6 and, as we will see in [21], and
even with non-regular Dirac manifolds of compact types.

3.4. The extended monodromy groups. We recall (see [18]) that for any reg-
ular Poisson manifold (M, π) there is a monodromy map at x ∈ M :

∂mon,x : π2(S, x) → ν∗

x(S)

(3.5)

where S = Sx is the symplectic leaf through x. The monodromy group at x is
deﬁned as the image of the monodromy map:

Nmon|x := Im(∂mon,x) ⊂ ν∗

x(S),

and we set Nmon = ∪x∈M Nmon|x.

The origin of these Poisson invariants lies in the variation of symplectic areas,

but they admit several interpretations, all of which will be useful in the sequel:

• At the groupoid level, the Weinstein groupoid Σ(M, π) yields a homotopy

long exact sequence associated to s : s−1(x) → S with ﬁrst few terms:

π2(S, x)

∂mon,x

/ ν∗

x(S)

exp

/ Σx(M, π)

/ 1 .

This gives a description of Nmon|x as the kernel of the exponential map
exp : ν∗

x(S) → Σx(M, π).

• At the Lie algebroid level, any splitting τ : T S → T ∗

sequence of algebroids:

(3.6)

yields a curvature 2-form Ωτ ∈ Ω2(S, ν∗(S)) given by

Ωτ (X, Y ) := τ ([X, Y ]) − [τ (X), τ (Y )]

(3.7)
Viewing ν∗(S) as a ﬂat vector bundle for the Bott connection, the 2-form
Ωτ is closed as a form with coeﬃcients ν∗(S). Its cohomology class does
not depend on the choice of τ and deﬁnes a class [Ωτ ] ∈ H 2(S, ν∗(S)), and:

(for X, Y ∈ X(S)).

∂mon,x : π2(S, x) → ν∗

x(S),

[σ] 7→Zσ

Ωτ .

• The most geometric description of the monodromy arises as the variation
of symplectic areas of leafwise spheres: for any sphere σ : (S2, N ) → (Sx, x)
based at x and a transverse direction v ∈ νx(S), one can ﬁnd a foliated
family of spheres σt : (S2, N ) → (Sxt, xt), such that σ0 = σ and v = [ ˙xt];
one has:

h∂mon,x[σ], vi =

ωSxt .

(3.8)

Hence, the quantity h∂mon,x[σ], vi is the variation of the symplectic area of
σ in the normal direction v.

For integrable Poisson manifolds, each monodromy group Nmon|x is a discrete
subgroup of ν∗
x(S). As one could expect, they are closely related to the lattice ΛG
of an s-proper integration. In the s-proper case the rank of Nmon does not depend
on x, but it may fail to be a lattice, unless we are in the strong proper case. More
precisely, we have:

Theorem 3.4.1. Let (M, π) be a regular Poisson manifold. Then:

(i) Nmon ⊂ ΛG for any s-connected, proper integration (G, Ω) of (M, π);
(ii) Nmon = ΛΣ(M,π) if and only if (M, π) is strong proper.

Proof. We use the same notation of the proof of Theorem 3.3.1. Note that if

α ∈ Nmon|x then the corresponding right invariant vector ﬁeld eXα in Σ(M, π)

satisﬁes

φ1
eXα

= id.

Under the covering projection Σ(M, π) → G this vector ﬁeld is projected to Xα,
which therefore also satisﬁes φ1
Xα = id. It follows that α ∈ ΛG|x, so (i) holds. Now
(ii) follows from the deﬁnition of ΛG and the previous discussion on Nmon.
(cid:3)

In particular, we have the following characterization of regular Poisson manifolds

of strong C-type:

Corollary 3.4.2. A regular Poisson manifold (M, π) is of strong C-type if and
only if the foliation Fπ is of strong C-type and Nmon is a transverse integral aﬃne
structure for the symplectic foliation Fπ.

Proof. The previous theorem, combined with Theorem 2.0.5, proves the direct im-
plication. For the reverse implication, note ﬁrst that the lattice condition, together
with the integrability criteria of [17, 18], implies that Σ(M, π) is smooth. Moreover,
we have the short exact sequence of Lie groupoids:

1

/ ν∗(Fπ)/Nmon

/ Σ(M, π)

/ Mon(M, Fπ)

/ 1

where the second map associates to a cotangent path its base path, while the ﬁrst
map is induced from the exponential map exp : ν∗
x(Fπ) → Σx(M, π) (see [18]).
This is a sequence of Lie groupoids in which the extreme groupoids are of C-type.
It follows immediately that the middle one is also of C-type, so the result follows. (cid:3)

Conversely, one can look at regular Poisson manifolds (M, π) for which Nmon = 0.
We have the following result, which includes as a particular case Proposition 3.1.6:

Corollary 3.4.3. Let (M, π) be a regular Poisson manifold such that:

(i) the monodromy groups are trivial: Nmon = 0;
(ii) the symplectic foliation Fπ is of strong C-type.
Then each transversal integral aﬃne structure Λ on (M, π) determines an s-connected,
proper integration (GΛ, Ω) such that ΛGΛ = Λ. Moreover, if the symplectic leaves
are 1-connected, this establishes a bijection:

(cid:26) transversal integral aﬃne
structures Λ on (M, Fπ) (cid:27) 1−1←→(cid:26) s-connected, proper symplectic

integrations of (M, π)

(cid:27)

Proof. When Nmon = 0, the exponential map exp : ν∗(Fπ) → Σ(M, π) has no
kernel. Therefore, a transverse integral aﬃne structure Λ ⊂ ν∗(Fπ) yields a sub-
groupoid exp(Λ) ⊂ Σ(M, π), which is normal, discrete and Lagrangian. Hence,

(GΛ, Ω) := (Σ(M, π), ΩΣ(M,π))/ exp(Λ)

is a symplectic groupoid integrating (M, π). As in the proof of Corollary 3.4.2, this
symplectic groupoid is of C-type iﬀ Fπ is of C-type. It is also clear that ΛGΛ = Λ.
In general, the isotropy groups Σx(M, π) will not be connected, so there might be
diﬀerent symplectic groupoids deﬁning Λ. If the symplectic leaves are 1-connected,
then (GΛ, Ω) is the only integration deﬁning Λ.

A version of the hol-monodromy map appears in the work of I. M˘arcut [46] on
rigidity in Poisson geometry (see also [22]). For its geometric interpretation, we
will consider smooth marked surfaces in the leaf S through x, i.e. smooth maps

σ : (Σ, p) → (S, x),

with Σ a connected, oriented, compact surface without boundary, and p ∈ Σ. By
a leafwise deformation of σ we mean a family σt : (Σ, p) → (M, xt) of smooth
maps parametrized by t ∈ (−ǫ, ǫ), starting at σ0 = σ and such that for each ﬁxed
t the surface σt is inside the symplectic leaf through xt. The transversal variation
of σt at t = 0 is the class of the tangent vector

Our next aim is a more reﬁned version of Theorem 3.4.1, and this will require a
more reﬁned version of the monodromy groups. These are new invariants, related to
obstructions to s-properness, and they arise when revisiting the above descriptions
of Nmon|x: the basic idea is to replace the spheres (2-homotopy classes) in the leaf
S by more general surfaces (2-homology classes) in S.

Consider an arbitrary regular Poisson manifold (M, π) and ﬁx x ∈ M . We choose
a splitting τ : T S → T ∗
SM of the short exact sequence (3.6). In order to integrate
the resulting curvature 2-form Ωτ ∈ Ω2(S, ν∗(S)) over some surface we need ﬁrst to
pullback the vector bundle ν∗(S) → S along px : Shol
x → S, the Hol(∇)-covering for
the Bott connection based at x. This is the smallest cover over which the pullback
of ν∗(S) becomes a trivial vector bundle ν∗

x . We can then set:

x(S) × Shol

x → Shol

Deﬁnition 3.4.4. The hol-monodromy map of the regular Poisson manifold
(M, π) at x is the map:

dt(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0
varν(σt) :=(cid:20) d

σt(p)(cid:21) ∈ νx(S).

Note that given a smooth marked surface σ : (Σ, p) → (S, x) and a normal vector
v ∈ νx(S) there may not exist a leafwise deformation σt with transversal variation
varν(σt) = v. We will say that σ is holonomy-trivial with respect to the foliation
Fπ if the holonomy of Fπ along loops of type σ ◦ γ, with γ a loop in Σ, is trivial.

Lemma 3.4.5. For any holonomy-trivial marked surface σ : (Σ, p) → (S, x) and
v ∈ νx(F ), one can ﬁnd a leafwise deformation σt with varν (σt) = v. In this case,

σ admits a lift eσ : (Σ, p) → (Shol

x ,ex), where ex denotes the class of the trivial loop.

Remark 3.4.6. Note that the notion of a holonomy-trivial surface uses the (non-
linear) holonomy of the foliation Fπ, while the covering Shol
x → S is relative to the
Bott connection, i.e. the linear holonomy. Vanishing holonomy implies vanishing
linear holonomy, but not the converse. Hence, a holonomy-trivial surface admits a
lift to the cover Shol

x , but the converse is not true in general.

Proof. Fix a complete Riemannian metric on M , split T M = Fπ ⊕ E and consider:

φ : Eσ := σ∗E → M, φ(x, v) := expσ(x)(v).

Then T0xEσ = TxΣ ⊕ Eσ(x) and (dφ)0x : T0xEσ → Tσ(x)M becomes (i, (dσ)x),
where i : E ֒→ T M is the inclusion. Hence φ is transversal to Fπ and we can take

32

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

the pull-back foliation Fφ := φ∗Fπ as a foliation on Eσ. The codimension remains
the same, so the leaves of Fσ are two-dimensional. Since Σ is compact and tangent
to Fφ, it must be an entire leaf of Fπ. On the other hand, as a general property
of pull-back foliations, the holonomy of Fσ at p ∈ Σ factors through the holonomy
of Fπ at σ(p) = x ∈ S. Therefore, since σ is a holonomy-trivial surface, we deduce
that the holonomy of Fφ along Σ is trivial. By Reeb stability, Fφ is isomorphic, in
a neighborhood of Σ, to the trivial foliation Σ × Rq. Then φ yields a smooth map
Σ × Rq → M which takes leaves to leaves and induces isomorphisms at the level of
the normal bundle. This allows one to construct for any normal vector v ∈ νx(S) a
leafwise deformation σt with transversal variation varν(σt) = v.
(cid:3)

We then have the following geometric interpretation of the hol-monodromy in

of a holonomy-trivial σ:

terms of variations of symplectic areas whenever a class [eσ] ∈ H2(Shol, Z) is a lift

Proposition 3.4.7. Let (M, π) be a regular Poisson manifold. If σ : (Σ, p) → (S, x)
is a holonomy-trivial marked surface then:

ν(S) → S becomes trivial. Of course, we can consider larger covers of S, i.e., covers

Consider now a regular Poisson manifold (M, π) whose symplectic foliation Fπ

is proper. In this case the linear and non-linear holonomy of Fπ coincide, hence:

• the geometric interpretation of the hol-monodromy is valid for every class

in H2(Shol

x , Z);

• given any s-connected foliation groupoid E integrating the symplectic foli-
ation Fπ, the s-ﬁber yields a covering space t : E(x, −) → Sx which lies in
x . In particular, we have a corresponding monodromy

between eSx and Shol

map:

∂E,x : H2(E(x, −), Z) → ν∗

x(S).

Deﬁnition 3.4.8. The E-monodromy group of (M, π) at x relative to the s-
connected integration E of the symplectic foliation Fπ, denoted NE |x, is the image
of ∂E,x.

We can ﬁnally discuss the more reﬁned version of Theorem 3.4.1:

Theorem 3.4.9. Let (M, π) be a regular Poisson manifold whose symplectic foli-
ation Fπ is proper. For any s-connected integration E of the symplectic foliation:

Nmon ⊂ NE ⊂ Nhol,

where the ﬁrst (respectively, second) inclusion becomes equality for E = Mon(M, Fπ)
(respectively, for E = Hol(M, Fπ)). Moreover, if E = B(G) is induced by an s-
connected, proper integration G as in Theorem 2.6.9, then

NE ⊂ ΛG.

Remark 3.4.10. When E = B(G) is induced by an s-proper integration G, it will
follow from Section 5.2 that NE will be not just a bundle of discrete subgroups of
ν∗(Fπ), but also a smooth, closed sub-bundle (in particular, of constant rank). In
the maximal rank case, i.e. when NE is a lattice, one can show that E is induced

“normalized”.

by an s-proper integration eG with Λ eG = NE . Such integrations eG deserve the name

Proof. The ﬁrst part of the theorem follows from the remarks proceeding it. For the
second part we use the Atiyah sequence (3.6). Recall that similar sequences arise
from principal bundles: if q : P → N is a principal G-bundle, then A(P ) := T P/G
is not only a vector bundle over N but also a Lie algebroid with anchor induced
by dq and with the bracket coming from the identiﬁcation Γ(A(P )) = X(P )G−inv.
The short exact sequence associated to it is

0

/ P ×G g

/ A(P )

dq

/ T N

/ 0.

(3.9)

Splittings τ of this sequence are the same thing as connections on the principal
bundle, while the associated expression (3.7) is precisely the curvature of the con-
nection. When G = T is a torus, this closed form will represent the Chern class of
the bundle, c1(P ) ∈ H 2(N, t), which is integral: the pairing of c1(P ) with elements
in H2(N, Z) always lands in ΛT, the kernel of the exponential map of t.

Now, if G is an s-connected, proper integration of (M, π), then we obtain a
principal bundle q : G(x, −) → E(x, −) with structure group the torus Tx = Tx(G)
(see Theorem 2.6.9). Moreover, the associated Atiyah sequence coincides with the
pull-back of (3.6) via the covering map pE : E(x, −) → S, which is just a translation
of the fact that G integrates the Lie algebroid T ∗M . We deduce that

E [Ωτ ] ∈ H 2(E(x, −), ν∗

34

coincides with the Chern class of the torus bundle q : G(x, −) → E(x, −). The
integrality of this Chern class shows that evaluation on classes in H2(E(x, −)) lands
in ΛG, so we conclude that NE ⊂ ΛG.
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.4.11. If (M, π) is of s-proper type then Nhol is a smooth closed sub-
bundle of discrete subgroups of ν∗(Fπ). Moreover, if E is induced by an s-connected,
s-proper integration, then NE is of ﬁnite index in Nhol.

Proof. Let G be an s-connected, s-proper integration. Using the ﬁrst part of Remark
3.4.10, it suﬃces to show that NE |x is of ﬁnite index in Nhol|x. This follows from

a general remark about ﬁnite covers applied to E(x, −) → Shol: if q : eN → N is a

ﬁnite cover between compact manifolds then

q∗(H2(eN , Z)/torsion) ⊂ H2(N, Z)/torsion

is of ﬁnite index. This is equivalent to the fact that, when working over Q, q∗ :
In turn, this follows from the standard spectral

sequence E2
homology over Q of ﬁnite groups is trivial, we deduce that Hk(N ) is isomorphic to
(cid:3)

p,q = Hp(Γ, Hq(eN )) =⇒ Hp+q(N ) (Γ the group of the cover): since the

H2(eN ) → H2(N ) is surjective.
the space of Γ-coinvariants of Hk(eN ) and q∗ becomes the quotient map.

Remark 3.4.12. The notions of extended monodromy discussed here extend to
non-regular Poisson manifolds and, in fact, to any Lie algebroid. We postpone this
discussion to [21].

3.5. Examples. Here are some examples to illustrate the behavior of the groups
Nmon and Nhol, their computation and their relevance to the compactness-types.

3.5.1. A non-proper example with Nhol discrete. The groups Nhol can be seen as
Poisson invariants whose discreteness is a necessary condition for properness- cf.
Corollary 3.4.11. Here is an example which shows that this condition is not suﬃcient
and that Nhol provides interesting invariants also in the non-proper case. Start with
the Reeb foliation F of S3 and make it into a symplectic foliation by choosing a
metric on S3 and considering the induced area forms on the leaves. The resulting
Poisson structure is not of proper type since the Reeb foliation is not proper: for
example, the linear and non-linear holonomy of the compact leaf are distinct.

These Reeb type Poisson structures are always integrable since for any symplectic
leaf S we have π2(S, x) = {0}, so that Nmon = {0}. On the other hand, for points x
in the open leaves we obviously have Nhol|x = {0}, since the leaves are contractible.
However, we claim that for points in the compact leaf, Nhol is not trivial. In order
to see this, we consider as a model for a neighborhood of the compact leaf T2 the
space M = (R × S1 × R)/Z, and we let R+ × S1 × R, with coordinates (r, θ, z), be
foliated by the level sets of the submersion:

F (r, θ, z) = (r2 − 1)ez,

and let Z act by translations in the z coordinate. The compact leaf T2 corresponds
to r = 1. On R+ × S1 × R we consider the regular Poisson structure:

The function F is a Casimir and π is invariant under the Z-action, so we obtain a
Poisson structure on M whose symplectic foliation is the Reeb foliation. Choosing

is a discrete subgroup. Notice, by the way, that the (non-linear) holonomy of the
compact leaf is non-trivial and that there are no holonomy-trivial σ : Σ → T2 with
[σ] 6= 0, so one cannot compute ∂hol by transverse variations of symplectic areas.
In any case, the groups Nhol are discrete, but they do not form a smooth closed
sub-bundle of ν∗(Fπ) (compare with Corollary 3.4.11).

3.5.2. An s-proper but not strong proper example. Consider now

M = T2 × R+,

π = t ∂

.

As above, Nmon = {0} and Nhol is clearly a lattice. In particular (M, π) is not
of strong proper type but, since the symplectic foliation is of proper type (even
simple), one may expect that (M, π) is of proper type. Let us prove all these in an
explicit manner. It is useful to remark that the universal cover of (M, π),

sits as an open Poisson submanifold of the linear h(3)∗, where h(3) is the Lie algebra
of the Heisenberg group H(3) of unipotent upper triangular 3 × 3 matrices:

and where we use ξ1, ξ2, t for the coordinates with respect to the canonical basis of
h(3)∗, corresponding to x, y and z, respectively. Hence the canonical integration of

(x, y, z) · (ξ1, ξ2, t) = (ξ1 + ty, ξ2 − tx, t).

(3.10)

The symplectic form on this groupoid comes from the Liouville form on T ∗H(3).
After trivializing T ∗H(3) using left translations, in our coordinates, it becomes

Ω = dξ1 ∧ dx + dξ2 ∧ dy + dt ∧ dz − tdx ∧ dy − xdt ∧ dy,

(3.11)

Of course, one can check directly that (H(3) ⋉ fM , Ω) is a symplectic groupoid
integrating (fM ,eπ). The action of π1(M ) = Z2 is Poisson hence it lifts to an

action on the groupoid by symplectic groupoid automorphisms. Hence the canonical
integration of (M, π) can be described exactly as above using (3.10) and (3.11) but
with R2 × R+ replaced by T2 × R+ and the coordinates (ξ1, ξ2) replaced by the
coordinates (θ1, θ2) of T2. It is clear that this groupoid is not proper.

Any other s-connected symplectic integration is obtained as a quotient modulo
a discrete normal subgroupoid H of the isotropy bundle, which is Lagrangian as a
submanifold of (Σ(M, π), Ω). Now observe that the isotropy bundle is:

{(x, y, z, θ1, θ2, t) ∈ H3 × M : yt ∈ Z, xt ∈ Z, z ∈ R} ∼= (Z2 × R) × M,

so any local (bi)section of the isotropy bundle is of the form:

where m, n ∈ Z and r(θ1, θ2, t) is smooth on M . The section is Lagrangian iﬀ:

ﬁt into a subgroupoid so that G := Σ(M, π)/H is s-proper and Ω descends to G.
This gives an explicit s-connected, s-proper integration of (M, π) with ΛG = Nhol.

3.5.3. The free Hamiltonian T -spaces perspective. A fundamental tool to construct
Poisson structures is by Hamiltonian reduction of symplectic manifolds. This is
recalled in Appendix A, in the general context of symplectic groupoids. Integral
aﬃne manifolds (B, Λ) provide the simplest examples of symplectic groupoids: the
symplectic torus bundle TΛ. These give rise to the simpler theory of Hamiltonian
TΛ-spaces (see A.4) where one can take Corollary A.4.1 as deﬁnition. For a free
Hamiltonian TΛ-space q : (X, ΩX ) → B with connected ﬁbers, the reduced Poisson
manifold Xred = X/TΛ is of proper type, it will have B as (smooth) leaf space and
the induced integral structure is precisely Λ (cf. Corollary A.4.2). Looking at the
explicit s-connected integrating groupoid X ⋆
TΛ

X given by (A.4), we see that:

(a) it is s-proper iﬀ q : X → B is proper;
(b) it is compact iﬀ X is compact;
(c) it is the canonical integration iﬀ the q-ﬁbers are 1-connected.
Already when B is 1-dimensional, with the standard integral aﬃne structure, pro-
duces interesting examples. For instance, the strong compact type example from
[47] arises via this procedure with B = S1. For B = R, using maps q with ﬁbers
which are not 1-connected may produce examples which are not strong proper but
are proper (or s-proper if q is proper). The previous example ﬁts into this scheme,
but here is a slightly more general class of examples.

Start with a symplectic manifold (S0, ω0) and consider the regular Poisson mani-
fold M = S0 × R+, whose symplectic leaves are (S0 × {t}, tω0), Using the geometric
interpretation of the monodromy, we ﬁnd that

Nmon = PerS2(ω0) :=(cid:26)[σ] ∈ π2(S0, x0) :Zσ

ω0(cid:27) ⊂ R,

the group of spherical periods of ω0. Since the holonomy of the foliation is trivial
Nhol is computed similarly and gives the full group of periods Per(ω0). Hence, while
the discreteness of PerS2(ω0) is the obstruction to integrability, the discreteness of
Per(ω0) arises as an obstruction to properness. This time, this is the only obstruc-
tion. This can be seen by producing explicit proper integrations and that is done
by realizing M via reduction. Let us assume Per(ω0) = Z, so that one can ﬁnd a

PMCT 2

37

principal S1-bundle p : P → S0 whose Chern class is [ω0]. That means that we ﬁnd
a connection 1-form θ ∈ Ω1(P ) with dθ = p∗ω0. The symplectization of (P, θ):

X = P × R+, ΩX = d(tθ),

with S1-acting on the ﬁrst coordinate and q : (X, ΩX ) → R the projection, is a
Hamiltonian TZ-space. Its Poisson reduced space is Xred = M so, by the general
discussion, M is of proper type (and of s-proper type iﬀ S0 is compact).

Here are some concrete examples, with various behavior of Nmon and Nhol:

(a) if (S0, ω0) = (S2, a ωS2), then Nmon = Nhol = a · Z;
(b) if (S0, ω0) = (Σg, b ωΣg ), then Nmon = 0 and Nhol = b · Z;
(c) if (S0, ω0) = (S2 × Σg, a ωS2 ⊕ b ωΣg ), then Nmon = a · Z and Nhol = a · Z + b · Z;
where a, b ∈ R \ {0}, and ωS2, ωΣg , are normalized area forms on the sphere and on
the closed surface of genus g > 0. Cases (b) and (c) come with inﬁnite fundamental
groups, hence they produce examples which are not strong proper. By the previous
discussion, they are s-proper except when a/b /∈ Q. In all the cases one can proceed
as in the previous example (g = 1), and construct explicit s-connected, s-proper
integrations, this time using the Lie theory of SO(3) (if g = 0) or of SL(2) (if g > 1).

4. The linear variation theorem I: 1-connected leaves

The linear variation in the titles of this section and the next one refers to a
fundamental result concerning PMCTs, which is a generalization of the classical
Duistermaat-Heckman Theorem on the variation of the cohomology class of the
symplectic form of symplectic reduced spaces. Loosely speaking, we will see that
for a PMCT the cohomology class of the symplectic form on the leaves varies
linearly, relative to the integral aﬃne structure on the leaf space. One can state
this result in a precise way in several distinct ways and we will see that each of
these exhibit interesting features of the PMCT and its transverse geometry.

Throughout this section we ﬁx a Poisson manifold (M, π) of s-proper type and

an s-connected, s-proper integration (G, Ω) ⇒ (M, π). Moreover:

• Standing assumption in this section: The symplectic leaves of (M, π)

are 1-connected.

This assumption will be dropped in the next section, where we will consider the
general case. The advantage of dealing ﬁrst with 1-connected symplectic leaves is
that there are no subtleties arising from the geometry of the leaf space: in this case
B = M/Fπ is smooth and there is only one groupoid integrating Fπ, namely the
equivalence relation M ×B M ⊂ M ×M associated with the submersion p : M → B.
Therefore we do not have to worry about the foliation groupoid B(G) (cf. Theorem
2.6.9) or, equivalently, with the orbifold structure on B, which may be present even
when B is smooth but the leaves are not 1-connected.

4.1. The developing map for integral aﬃne structures. The linear variation
theorem, in one form or another, involves a basic concept of integral aﬃne geometry
which we have not discussed so far. This is done in this section, where we ﬁx an
integral aﬃne manifold (B, Λ) and we discuss its developing map [36, 61]. This
is a local diﬀeomorphism of integral aﬃne manifolds

dev : (eB,eΛ) → (Rq, Zq)

38

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

deﬁned on the universal cover eB endowed with the pull-back eΛ of Λ. Let us ﬁrst

recall the standard deﬁnition:

Fix a point b0 ∈ B and an integral aﬃne chart (U0, χ0) centered
at b0. For any path γ starting at b0, cover it by a ﬁnite number of
integral aﬃne charts χi : Ui → χi(Ui) ⊂ Rq, 0 ≤ i ≤ r. Arrange
the coordinates charts inductively so that each two consecutive ones
match on the intersection (this can be done since the changes or co-
ordinates, being aﬃne, are deﬁned on the entire Rq). Then dev([γ])
is the image of γ(1) by the last coordinate chart.

If one restricts to loops γ and considers the entire change of coordinates between
the ﬁrst and the last chart, one obtains the integral aﬃne holonomy represen-
tation hAﬀ : π1(B) → Aﬀ Z(Rq), where π1(B) = π1(B, b0). Of course,

hAﬀ = (dev(γ), hlin(γ))

where hlin : π1(B) → GLZ(Rq) is the linear holonomy representation of (B, Λ),
i.e. the linear holonomy of the ﬂat connection on B induced by Λ. These represen-
tations give rise to the aﬃne holonomy group ΓAﬀ := hAﬀ (π1(B)) ⊂ Aﬀ Z(Rq)
and similarly the linear holonomy group Γlin. Note that ΓAﬀ is an integral aﬃne
group as in Example 3.1.3, whose linear part is Γlin. The factorization of the linear
holonomy representation:

π1(B) hAff

/ ΓAﬀ

pr2

/ Γlin

gives rise to a sequence of covering spaces by integral aﬃne manifolds:

/ BAﬀ

/ Blin

/ B

eB

where the middle and the last spaces are called the aﬃne and linear holonomy
covers, respectively. They are the smallest covers with trivial aﬃne and linear

Rq and Blin = Rq/Γtr.

holonomy, respectively. For instance, in the situation of Example 3.1.3, eB = BAﬀ =

The standard deﬁnitions given above for the developing map and the aﬃne ho-
lonomy have a drawback: they both depend on a choice of a base point b0 ∈ B and
an integral aﬃne chart around b0. However, it is possible to give a more intrinsic
deﬁnition, in the spirit of the present work, using the language of groupoids, as
we now explain. This approach will turn out to be very useful in the sequel. We
denote by GLΛ∨(T B) ⇒ B (respectively, Aﬀ Λ∨ (T B) ⇒ B) the Lie groupoid whose
arrows are the integral linear (respectively, integral aﬃne) isomorphisms between
the ﬁbers of T B. Our convention is that an arrow φ : TxB → TyB has source y
and target x. Notice that:

(i) Parallel transport for the canonical ﬂat connection ∇ of (B, Λ) deﬁnes the

linear holonomy, which can be seen as morphism of Lie groupoids:

hlin : Π1(B) → GLΛ∨ (T B),

hlin([γ]) : Tγ(1)B → Tγ(0)B.

(4.1)

(ii) The connection ∇ is torsion free and this can be interpreted as saying that

the identity map

Id : T B → T B

/
/

PMCT 2

is a 1-cocycle on the Lie algebroid T B with coeﬃcients in the representation
T B. Hence, it integrates to a groupoid 1-cocycle in Π1(B) with values in T B:

dev : Π1(B) → T B,

[γ] 7→ dev([γ]) ∈ Tγ(0)B.

The general formula for integrating algebroid 1-cocycles gives the expression:

dev([γ]) =Z 1

0

hlin(γǫ)( ˙γ(ǫ))dǫ,

and the cocycle condition means that for any two composable arrows in Π1(B):

dev([γ] ◦ [τ ]) = dev([τ ]) + hlin([τ ])(dev([γ])).

These two pieces of structure can be organized together into an integral aﬃne

action of Π1(B) on (T B, Λ∨): any [γ] ∈ Π1(B) induces an aﬃne transformation

Tγ(1)B → Tγ(0)B, v 7→ v · [γ] = dev([γ]) + hlin([γ])(v).

Hence, one obtains a morphism of Lie groupoids

hAﬀ : Π1(B) → Aﬀ Λ∨ (T B).

(4.2)

In order to recover the classical/based aﬃne holonomy representation and devel-
oping map, one restricts to the isotropy group of Π1(B) at b0, which is π1(B, b0),
and to the s-ﬁber above b0, which is the model for the universal cover using paths

starting at b0: eB = s−1(b0). One obtains the linear and aﬃne representations at b0,

hAﬀ |b0 : π1(B, b0) → Aﬀ Λ∨

hlin|b0 : π1(B, b0) → GLΛ∨

(Tb0 B),

(Tb0 B),

b

b0

and the developing map at b0,

dev |b0 : eB → Tb0B.

Finally, a choice of a basis bΛ for Λb0 (which is equivalent to a choice of an inte-
) ∼= (Rq, Zq),
gral aﬃne chart centered at b0) leads to an identiﬁcation (Tb0B, Λ∨
b0
and we recover the original notions. Note also that, since Π1(B) is transitive, no
information is lost by restricting at b0.

appears in the work of Matsusima [48], who attributes the idea to Koszul.

The description of dev : eB → Rq as a 1-cocycle for π1(B, b0) with values in Rq
Remark 4.1.1. The image Ω ⊂ Rq of dev : eB → Rq is an open subset which is

invariant under the aﬃne action of ΓAﬀ . When the action is free and proper, the
induced map B → Ω/ΓAﬀ will be a local diﬀeomorphism between integral aﬃne
manifolds. The conclusion of the Markus conjecture (Conjecture 3.1.4) is equivalent
to saying that Ω = Rq and that the last map is a diﬀeomorphism. In turn, this is
also equivalent to the condition that the linear connection is geodesically complete.

4.2. The linear variation. We now return to Poisson geometry and deﬁne the
linear variation of the leafwise symplectic cohomology class.

Under our standing assumption, the transverse integral aﬃne structure ΛG ⊂
ν∗(Fπ) deﬁned by G (see Theorem 3.3.1) is the pull-back of an integral aﬃne struc-
ture on the manifold B = M/Fπ. In this section we will only use the structure on
B, for which we use the same notation ΛG.

On the other hand, we can deﬁne a vector bundle H → B whose ﬁbers are the

degree 2 cohomology of the symplectic leaves:

Hb := H 2(Sb)

40

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

There are two things to notice about the vector bundle H → B:

(i) the integral cohomology yields a structure of an integral vector bundle (H, HZ);
(ii) the leafwise symplectic form yields a canonical section ̟ ∈ Γ(B, H):

b 7→ ̟b := [ωp−1(b)] ∈ H 2(Sb).

(4.3)

There is a rich interplay between the integral aﬃne structure ΛG on B and the
integral vector bundle (H, HZ). To make this precise note that, by (i) above, the
bundle H → B has a canonical ﬂat connection ∇, the so-called Gauss-Manin
connection. Our ﬁrst formulation of the variation of the symplectic form is:

Deﬁnition 4.2.1. The linear variation of ̟ is the bundle map:

varlin

̟ : T B → H, v 7→ varlin

̟ (v) := ∇v̟.

Its image is called the linear variation bundle of ̟, denoted:

and it has an integral part, denoted:

V lin

̟ := varlin

̟ (T B) ⊂ H,

̟ (Λ∨
G ⊂ T B is the lattice induced by (G, Ω).

̟,Z := varlin

V lin

G),

where Λ∨

Note that the linear variation ̟, as well as its image V lin

̟ , does not depend on

the speciﬁc integration (G, Ω), while the integral part V lin

̟,Z does.

We will see that we have always V lin

̟,Z ⊂ HZ. A key ingredient in the proof is the
following: since Fπ is regular, we can choose a splitting for all leaves at the same
time, i.e., a bundle map τ : Fπ → T ∗M which is a splitting of π♯ : T ∗M → Fπ.
The curvature Ωτ of this splitting gives a 1-form [Ωτ ] ∈ Ω1(B; H) by setting:

[Ωτ ] : T B → H,

vb 7→ [hΩτ , vbi] ∈ H 2(Sb).

Here we use the identiﬁcation TbB ∼= νx(Fπ), so vb can be thought of as a constant
section of ν(Sb). Note that [Ωτ ] is independent of the choice of splitting τ and:

Proposition 4.2.2. If (M, π) is regular with compact, 1-connected, leaves, then:

∇̟ = [Ωτ ].

In particular, if v ∈ TbB and σ : (S2, pN ) → (Sb, x), then:

Zσ

varlin

̟ (v) = h∂mon([σ]), vi.

(4.4)

(4.5)

Proof. Clearly, the integral formula (4.5) follows from (4.4) and the deﬁnition of
the monodromy in terms of the curvature.

To prove (4.4), let us a chose a distribution D ⊂ T M complementary to Fπ, so

that D ∼= ν(Fπ). This gives rise to a unique extension eω ∈ Ω2(M ) of the leafwise
symplectic form satisfying iVeω = 0, for any V ∈ D. This extension, in turn, gives
rise to a splitting τ : Fπ → T ∗M , X 7→ iXeω, with a curvature 2-form Ωτ . We

claim that if V ∈ X(D) is any vector ﬁeld deﬁned in a neighborhood of Sb whose
restriction to Sb projects to vb ∈ T B, then:
(a) for any section ¯η ∈ Γ(H) represented by η ∈ Ω2(M ) with iV η = 0 one has:

∇v ¯η = [(£V η)|Sb ];

(b) £Veω = Ωτ (V ).

PMCT 2

41

These will imply (4.4).

Item (a) follows from the fact that the Gauss-Manin connection can be deﬁned
by lifting a vector ﬁeld X on B to M via a distribution D, since the ﬂow of the
horizontal lift gives a 1-parameter group of diﬀeomorphisms of the ﬁbers, that
preserves the integral cohomology.

In order to prove item (b), we see that, for any X, Y ∈ Fπ, the deﬁnition of the

curvature 2-form gives:

Ωτ (X, Y )(V ) = h[τ (X), τ (Y )]π − τ ([X, Y ]), V i

which shows that (b) holds. Here, we have used ﬁrst that

= h[iXeω, iYeω]π, V i
= −(£V π)(iXeω, iYeω) = (£Veω)(X, Y ),
together with iVeω = 0 and π(iXeω, iYeω) = −eω(X, Y ), which yields:

iV [α, β]π = iπ♯(α)diV β − iπ♯(β)diV α − (£V π)(α, β),

(£V π)(iXeω, iYeω) = −(£Veω)(X, Y ).

(α, β ∈ Ω2(M ))

(cid:3)

In what follows we make use of the following terminology related to integral
vector bundles (E, EZ): a weak integral sub-bundle of E is an integral vector
bundle (F, FZ) for which F is a vector sub-bundle and FZ ⊂ EZ; it is called an
integral vector sub-bundle if FZ = F ∩ EZ.

Proposition 4.2.3. For any Poisson manifold (M, π) with 1-connected leaves and
an s-connected, s-proper integration G, varlin
̟ is a Π1(B)-equivariant morphism of
integral vector bundles,

varlin

̟ : (T B, Λ∨

Moreover, (V lin

̟ (Λ∨

G ⊂ Tp(x)B ⇐⇒ λ(v) ∈ Z, ∀ λ ∈ ΛG

⇐⇒ Zσ

⇐⇒ varlin

̟ (v) ∈ H 2(S, Z)

̟ (Λ∨

where, for the last implication, we used that S is simply connected. This proves
that varlin
G ) ⊂ HZ. Since the actions of Π1(B) on T B and H are by parallel
transport relative to the ﬂat connections determined by ΛG and HZ, we also obtain
that varlin

̟ is Π1(B)-equivariant.

Next we prove that V lin

̟,Z is a lattice in V lin

̟ . It is discrete since it sits inside
̟,Z is compact. But this follows from

HZ, hence it suﬃces to remark that V lin
the fact that Λ∨

̟ /V lin

G is a lattice in T B and we have a surjective map:

varlin

̟ : T B/Λ∨

G → V lin

̟ /V lin

̟,Z.

42

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

Finally, in the strong s-proper case, the only implication above becomes an
(cid:3)

equivalence, and we obtain that V lin

̟,Z = HZ ∩ V lin
̟ .

The previous proposition allows one to identify certain “building blocks” sitting
inside (M, π). The extreme cases follow easily from the previous two propositions:

Corollary 4.2.4. For any s-proper Poisson manifold (M, π) with simply connected
leaves one has:

(i) Zero-variation: varlin
(ii) Full-variation: varlin

̟ = 0 iﬀ p : (M, π) → B is a symplectic ﬁbration;
̟ is injective iﬀ (M, π) is strong s-proper.

Proof. By Proposition 4.2.2, varlin
̟ = 0 is equivalent to the fact that all the classes
[Ωτ |Sb ] vanish. These classes are the restrictions to the leaves of a global class
[Ωτ ] ∈ H 2(Fπ, ν∗), which can also be described more directly (see [18]) by choosing

an extension eω ∈ Ω2(M ) of the symplectic forms on the leaves, and then taking:

Ωτ (X, Y )(V ) = dνeω(X, Y )(V ) = deω(X, Y, V ).

A spectral sequence argument and the fact that the leaves are 1-connected, implies
that the vanishing of all the classes [Ωτ |Sb ] is equivalent to the existence of an

By Proposition 4.2.2, Ker(varlin

tion of symplectic ﬁbrations (see [37]).

extension eω such that dνeω = 0. This last condition is a well-known characteriza-

̟ ) is the annihilator of Nmon and, by Proposition
4.2.3, Im(varlin
̟ is equivalent to
Nmon being a lattice. By Theorem 3.4.1, this is equivalent to (M, π) being of strong
s-proper type.
(cid:3)

̟ ) is a discrete group. Hence the injectivity of varlin

When an s-proper Poisson manifold (M, π) has full-variation, Proposition 4.2.3
̟ realizes (T B, Λ∨) as an integral vector sub-bundle of (H, HZ)

above shows that varlin
if and only if G is the Weinstein groupoid of (M, π).

For the general case, we look at

K := Ker(varlin

̟ ) ⊂ T B

and this leads to a decomposition of (M, π) into a foliation by Poisson submanifolds
of zero-variation:

Theorem 4.2.5. For any s-proper Poisson manifold (M, π) with simply connected
leaves, K deﬁnes an involutive distribution of constant rank.
If (G, Ω) is an s-
connected, s-proper integration, then one has:

(i) The subgroup

{ξ ∈ T ∗B : ξ(v) ∈ Z for all v ∈ (varlin

̟ )−1(HZ)} ⊂ T ∗B

sits inside ν∗(K) and deﬁnes a transverse integral aﬃne structure for K;

(ii) Each leaf K of K is an integral aﬃne submanifold of B and the resulting

Poisson submanifold

MK := p−1(K) ⊂ M

has zero-variation. In particular, p : MK → K is a symplectic ﬁbration over
the integral aﬃne manifold K;

(iii) For any transversal T to K of complementary dimension, the resulting Poisson

submanifold

MT := p−1(T ) ⊂ M
is a Poisson manifold of strong s-proper type.

PMCT 2

43

Proof. First of all, the fact that varlin
̟ is Π1(B)-equivariant implies that K has cons-
tant rank. The Gauss-Manin connection being ﬂat, its curvature tensor vanishes,
which obviously implies involutivity of K.

Next, we turn to the proof of (i). We work at the level of B: under the isomor-
p(x)B, the monodromy group of (M, π) at any x ∈ p−1(b) becomes

x(F ) ∼= T ∗

phism ν∗
a subgroup Nmon|b ⊂ T ∗

b B. Moreover, by Theorem 3.4.1 (i), we have

Nmon ⊂ ΛG ⊂ T ∗B.

Since ΛG is a lattice, the ﬁbers Nmon|b will be discrete, hence also closed in T ∗

b B.

For a closed subgroup C ⊂ V in a vector space, we set

C∨ := {ξ ∈ V ∗ : ξ(C) ⊂ Z}.

Notice that (C∨)∨ = C. Also, to any such closed subgroup C we associate two
subspaces: Span(C) ⊂ V the span over R, and Cospan(C) ⊂ V the cospan over
R, deﬁned as the largest vector subspace of V contained in C. Note that the
span/cospan of C∨ coincides with the annihilator of the cospan/span of C. Moreover:
(a) if C is discrete, then C is a lattice in Span(C);
(b) if C spans V , then C/ Cospan(C) is a lattice in V / Cospan(C).

Back to our situation, Proposition 4.2.2 shows that K is the annihilator of Nmon.
Equivalently, Span(Nmon) = K0 so Nmon is a lattice in ν∗(K) = (K)0. Since
Nmon ⊂ ΛG, sections of Nmon are necessarily closed forms, hence Nmon deﬁnes a
transverse integral aﬃne structure for K. In order to obtain the description of Nmon
directly in terms of varlin
̟ , one notes that the sequence of implications in the proof
of Proposition 4.2.3 all become equivalences if we replace Λ∨

mon, so that:

G by N ∨

N ∨

mon = (varlin

̟ )−1(HZ).

(4.6)

Since Nmon = (N ∨

mon)∨ this proves the description in (i).

While (i) is a statement about Nmon, part (ii) of the proposition is about ΛG
G is a lattice in K.

and its subtle interaction Nmon. We need to prove that K ∩ Λ∨
Since it is clearly discrete, it suﬃces to prove that the resulting quotient

K/K ∩ Λ∨
G

∼= (K + Λ∨

G)/Λ∨
G

is compact. Under the previous identiﬁcation, this quotient is the kernel of the map

N ∨

mon/Λ∨

G → N ∨

mon/(K + Λ∨

G ).

Notice that the image of the last map is discrete, since it is a quotient of N ∨
mon/K,
which is itself discrete by part (i). This implies that the kernel is closed in N ∨
mon/Λ∨
G,
hence it suﬃces to remark that this last space is compact. Indeed, (4.6) implies
that N ∨

G is the kernel of the map induced by varlin
̟ :

mon/Λ∨

varlin

̟ : T B/Λ∨

and since T B/Λ∨
G is compact, the result follows. To conclude the proof of (ii),
notice that MK with the induced Poisson structure will have zero variation, since
the associated normal bundles are precisely the kernel of varlin
̟ .

Finally, to prove (iii), the linear variation map for MT will be just the injective

descent of varlin

̟ , deﬁned on T B/K, modulo the obvious identiﬁcations:

Example 4.2.6. For a Lie algebra g of compact type, the dual M = g∗ is a Poisson
manifold of proper type. In this case, we have the decomposition g = z ⊕ gss into
center and semisimple part, and z = {0} if and only if g∗ is of strong-proper
type. The passing from M to MT in Proposition 4.2.5 should be seen as a Poisson
generalization of the passing from a compact Lie algebra to its semi-simple part.
This example will be further discussed in Section 4.5.1.

4.3. The linear variation theorem. We now move to the study of the actual
variation of ̟:

Deﬁnition 4.3.1. The variation of ̟ is the bundle map:

var̟ : Π1(B) → H,

[γ] 7→ γ∗̟γ(1),

where γ∗ stands for the parallel transport associated to the Gauss-Manin connec-
tion. The variation bundle of ̟ is the image of var̟:

V ̟ := Im(var̟) ⊂ H

Our aim now is to show that the variation is linear. For this, as it will become
apparent in the sequel, it is more natural to consider an aﬃne point of view. We
deﬁne the aﬃne variation of ̟ to be:

varAﬀ

̟ := ̟ + varlin

̟ : T B → H,

and the aﬃne variation bundle to be its image:

V Aﬀ

̟ := varAﬀ

̟ (T B) = ̟ + V lin
̟ .

From this point of view, the relevant action of Π1(B) on T B is the one by aﬃne
transformations, as given by (4.2). We will refer to it as the integral aﬃne action
of Π1(B) on T B. On H, we will continue to use the linear action of Π1(B).

Our ﬁrst version of the statement that the variation is linear or, more precisely,

aﬃne, is the following:

Theorem 4.3.2. For any s-proper Poisson manifold (M, π) with 1-connected leaves
and an s-connected, s-proper integration (G, Ω), the developing map dev of the
integral aﬃne structure on B = M/Fπ identiﬁes the variation of ̟ with its aﬃne
variation, i.e. one has a commutative diagram:

Π1(B)

#●●●●●●●●

̟

In particular, V ̟ is open in V Aﬀ
̟ and they are both Π1(B)-invariant. Moreover,
the variation V ̟,b ⊂ H 2(Sb) at each b ∈ B sits inside the symplectic cone of the
symplectic leaf Sb.

Remark 4.3.3. The commutativity of the diagram in Theorem 4.3.2 is equivalent
to saying that varAﬀ

̟ is equivariant. In this way,

becomes a morphism of integral aﬃne representations of Π1(B).

Note that in this diagram:

Γ(H); it diﬀerentiates to the algebroid 1-cocycle v 7→ ∇v̟, i.e., varlin
̟ ;

(b) dev : Π1(B) → T B is the 1-cocycle on Π1(B) with values in T B which inte-

grates the algebroid 1-cocycle Id : T B → T B.

̟ : T B → H is a morphism of representations.

In order to obtain a more concrete picture, let us ﬁx

• a base point b0 ∈ B, and
• a Z-basis bΛ = {λ1, . . . , λq} for Λb0 .

For any x ∈ S, let P := s−1(x) be the s-ﬁber above x of the s-proper integration
(G, Ω) ⇒ (M, π). The submersion t : P → S is a principal Gx-bundle and the choice
of basis bΛ gives an identiﬁcation of the isotropy group with the standard q-torus
Tq. Hence P → S becomes a principal Tq-bundle and we consider its Chern classes:

c1, . . . , cq ∈ H 2(S)

(integral classes)

Since S is simply connected these classes do not depend on the base point x ∈ S.

Note that in the strong s-proper case the Chern classes c1, . . . , cq are linearly
independent, so var0 is a local diﬀeomorphism, and if G is the canonical integration
then they form a primitive family, in the sense that:

SpanZ(c1, . . . , cq) = SpanR(c1, . . . , cq) ∩ H 2(S, Z).

Hence, V Aﬀ

is an integral aﬃne subspace of H 2(S), not only a weak one.

Proof. The corollary follows from Proposition 4.2.3 and Theorem 4.3.2 once we
realize that varlin
(cid:3)

0 (λi) = ci. This follows immediately from (4.4).

Remark 4.3.5. The corollary shows that, for any v ∈ Im(dev0) ⊂ Rq, one can
ﬁnd a symplectic form ωv on S such that, in cohomology, we have:

[ωv] = [ω0] + v1c1 + · · · + vqcq.

This gives an explicit description for the image of the variation map inside the
symplectic cone as:

Im(var0) = {[ωv] : v ∈ Im(dev0)} ⊂ H 2(S).

Note however that the symplectic forms ωv are not unique. Also, while they can
locally be chosen to depend smoothly on v, it is not clear whether v 7→ ωv can be
chosen smooth on the entire open Im(dev0).

Theorem 4.3.2 and Corollary 4.3.4 are reminiscent of a famous result of Duister-
maat and Heckman [29] stating that for Hamiltonian torus actions on symplectic
manifolds the cohomology classes of their symplectic reduced spaces vary linearly.
We will explain in detail this connection in the next section.

For now we observe that the previous results suggests the following strategy to
construct examples of PMCTs. For simplicity we restrict to integral aﬃne manifolds
which are complete (see Conjecture 3.1.4).

Proposition 4.3.6. Consider an integral aﬃne manifold of type B = Rq/Γ, with
Γ ⊂ Aﬀ Z(Rq). Assume that Γ acts on a compact 1-connected manifold S, that we
can ﬁnd a smooth Γ-equivariant map

Rq ∋ v 7→ ωv ∈ Ω2

sympl(S),

and that there are linearly independent integral cohomology classes c1, . . . , cq in
H 2(S) such that:

[ωv] = [ω0] + v1c1 + . . . + vqcq,

(4.8)
Then M := S ×Γ Rq is a regular Poisson manifold of strong s-proper type (hence,
if B is compact, then M is of strong compact type).

∀ v ∈ Rq.

Note that the equivariance condition and (4.8) imply that the action of Γ on
[ω0] and the cis is given by (4.7). Therefore, in practice, one starts from some
smooth integral aﬃne group Γ ⊂ Aﬀ Z(Rq) writing its elements in the split form
γ = (vγ, A(γ)) (cf. Example 3.1.3) and then one tries to realize the identities (4.7)
inside the cohomology of a compact manifold S and to represent the right hand
side of (4.8) by symplectic forms.

Example 4.3.7. The simplest case to consider is B = S1 with its usual integral
aﬃne structure. The resulting problem turns out to be very closely related to
McDuﬀ and Salamon’s question on the existence of symplectic free circle actions
with contractible orbits. Actually, the example given by Kotschick in that context
[42] turns out to be precisely the answer to our problem for B = S1 (see also [47]).
That produces a very interesting example of Poisson manifold of strong compact
type with leaf space S1 and K3 surfaces as symplectic leaves. As we shall explain in
future work, one can use the structure of the moduli space of marked K3 surfaces
to build similar PMCTs of strong compact type with base the standard T2 and
symplectic leaf the K3 surface (more generally, the Hilbert scheme of n points on
the K3 surface).

4.4. The twisted Dirac case. We now brieﬂy discuss the changes one needs to
make so that the previous section applies also to twisted Dirac structures (for the
motivation, please see the Introduction). Therefore we ﬁx a closed 3-form φ ∈
Ω3(M ) and a φ-twisted Dirac structure L on M which, as before, we assume to be
regular, of s-proper type, with 1-connected leaves, and with leaf space B = M/FL.
To make sense of the linear variation, we interpret the class of ﬁberwise presym-
plectic forms as a section of a bundle over B, generalizing the section ̟ ∈ Γ(H)
used above. This forces us to consider the φ-twisted version of H:

Deﬁnition 4.4.1. The φ-twisted (second) cohomology at b ∈ B is

Hφ

b = H 2(Sb, φb) :=

{β ∈ Ω2(Sb) | dβ + φb = 0}

{dΩ1(Sb)}

.

b is non-empty).
The cohomology Hφ

Notice that this deﬁnition applies to any proper ﬁbration p : M → B together
with a closed 3-form φ ∈ Ω3(M ) whose restriction φb to each ﬁber is exact (so that
each Hφ

b is not a vector space, but it is an integral aﬃne space with
underlying integral aﬃne vector space (Hb, HZ,b). As φb is exact, Hodge theory
implies that these aﬃne spaces ﬁt into an integral aﬃne bundle (Hφ, HZ) with
underlying integral vector bundle (H, HZ).

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

Remark 4.4.2 (Integral aﬃne bundles). Given an aﬃne bundle E → B we denote
by Elin its underlying vector bundle. An integral aﬃne bundle (E, Elin
Z ) is an
Z ⊂ Elin. As before, one can talk about
aﬃne bundle E together with a lattice Elin
(weak) integral aﬃne sub-bundle and of morphisms between integral aﬃne bundles.
The notion of aﬃne connection makes sense on any aﬃne bundle E → B: the
space of sections Γ(E) is an aﬃne space with underlying vector space Γ(Elin) and
an aﬃne connection is an aﬃne map

∇ : Γ(E) → Ω1(B, Elin)

whose linear part is a linear connection on Elin. A (local) ﬂat section s is a section
satisfying ∇s = 0 and a ﬂat aﬃne connection is one for which there exist local
ﬂat sections through every point in E. If the aﬃne connection is ﬂat, then so is it
underlying linear connection on Elin. A ﬂat integral aﬃne bundle is an integral
aﬃne bundle (E, Elin
Z ) endowed with a ﬂat aﬃne connection ∇ whose underlying
linear connection ∇lin coincides with the one induced by the lattice Elin
Z .

The notion of parallel transport and its basic properties extend to the setting of
aﬃne connections. In particular, a ﬂat integral aﬃne bundle is the same thing as an
integral aﬃne bundle (E, Elin
Z ) together with an action of Π1(B) on E by integral
aﬃne transformations of the ﬁbers. Also, a morphism of ﬂat integral aﬃne
bundles is an integral aﬃne morphism f : E → F which is Π1(B)-equivariant.

While any vector space/bundle is canonically aﬃne, any integral vector bundle
is canonically a ﬂat integral aﬃne bundle, with the connection associated with the
integral structure. An aﬃne space/bundle is non-canonically isomorphic as aﬃne
spaces/bundles to its underlying vector space/bundle, and similarly if we add the
adjective “integral”, because an aﬃne bundle always has a global section. However,
a ﬂat integral aﬃne bundle E is not isomorphic as ﬂat integral aﬃne vector bundles
to its underlying integral aﬃne vector bundle, unless E has a global ﬂat section.
This is equivalent to the vanishing of the so-called radiance obstruction of the
ﬂat aﬃne bundle [35].

Example 4.4.3. Consider the tangent bundle T B of an integral aﬃne manifold
(B, Λ). Obviously, (T B, Λ∨) is an integral vector bundle, hence also a ﬂat integral
aﬃne one: the corresponding action of Π1(B) on T B is precisely the one induced
by the linear holonomy representation (4.1). However, T B admits yet another ﬂat
integral aﬃne structure, namely the one deﬁned by the aﬃne holonomy action of
Π1(B) on T B given by (4.2). For T B together with this ﬂat integral aﬃne structure
we will reserve the notation T AﬀB, and this is our realization of the aﬃne tangent
bundle from [35]. Of course, the only diﬀerence between T AﬀB and T B lies on the
Π1(B)-action that one considers.

In this framework, the identiﬁcation of the variation with the aﬃne variation

from Theorem 4.3.2 is equivalent to saying that

varAﬀ

̟ : (T Aﬀ B, Λ∨) → (H, HZ)

is a morphism of ﬂat integral aﬃne bundles (see Remark 4.3.3). Moreover, the aﬃne
variation bundle V Aﬀ
̟ is a ﬂat integral aﬃne bundle, with underlying integral aﬃne
vector space (V lin
̟ can be split into
two: (i) varAﬀ
̟ is a morphism of ﬂat integral aﬃne bundles and (ii)
V Aﬀ

̟,Z) and the previous statement about varAﬀ

̟ is a weak sub-bundle of (H, HZ).
We can now introduce a ﬂat connection on the integral aﬃne bundle (Hφ, HZ):

̟ : T Aﬀ B → V Aﬀ

Deﬁnition 4.4.4. For any a proper ﬁbration p : M → B with a closed 3-form
φ ∈ Ω3(M ) whose restriction to each ﬁber is exact, the twisted Gauss-Manin
connection ∇φ : Γ(Hφ) → Ω1(B, H) is given by:

h∇φ

d

where v ∈ TbB, s ∈ Γ(B, Hφ), [σ0] ∈ H2(Sb) is a homology class represented by a
map σ0 : Σ → Sb, and σ : [0, 1] × Σ → M is a map of ﬁbrations extending σ0 with
base map a curve in B representing v.

The independence of this deﬁnition on choices is a consequence of Stokes’ theorem
and the exactness of φ on ﬁbers. One checks directly that ∇φ is a morphism of
aﬃne spaces, and that its linear part is the Gauss-Manin connection on H.

A local ﬂat section through any c ∈ Hφ

b can be constructed as follows: over a
contractible neighborhood of b the twisting form is exact: φ = dχ. Therefore [−χ]φ
deﬁnes a local ﬂat section. It can be translated to attain the value c at b by adding
the appropriate local ﬂat section of H. Therefore Hφ is a ﬂat integral aﬃne bundle
with underlying integral vector bundle (H, HZ).

Now, given a φ-twisted Dirac manifold (M, L) we have the section ̟ ∈ Γ(Hφ)
and the twisted Gauss-Manin connection, and this allows one to proceed as before.
We can deﬁne the linear and aﬃne variations by the same formulas:

varlin

̟ := ∇φ̟ : T B → H,

varAﬀ

̟ := ̟ + varlin

̟ : T B → Hφ

and similarly for the linear/aﬃne variation bundles V lin
̟ . Also, using the
induced action of Π1(B) by parallel transport on Hφ one obtains the variation map

̟ and V Aﬀ

var̟ : Π1(B) → Hφ,

[γ] 7→ γ∗̟.

and its image the variation bundle V ̟.

The main results from the previous section carry over to this context, with

obvious modiﬁcations. For example:

Theorem 4.4.5. For any s-proper φ-twisted Dirac manifold (M, L) with 1-connec-
ted leaves and an s-connected, s-proper integration (G, Ω, φ), the developing map
dev of the integral aﬃne structure on B = M/Fπ identiﬁes the variation of ̟ with
its aﬃne variation, i.e. one has a commutative diagram:

̟ and they are both Π1(B)-invariant.

In particular, V ̟ is open in V Aﬀ
Proof. The proof of Theorem 4.3.2 applies word by word, with one exception: one
needs to be careful with the inclusion varlin
G ) ⊂ HZ of Proposition 4.2.3. For
that, we need to make sure that Proposition 4.2.2 still holds, and that sends us back
to a description of the monodromy map in terms of variations of presymplectic areas.
That was based on the choice of a splitting τ of (3.6) and the use of its curvature
(3.7). Such a splitting is provided by any extension of the foliated form ω to a
2-form on M and the curvature Ωτ is computed using the φ-twisted Dirac bracket.
The resulting formula is precisely (4.9), where Σ is a sphere and the variation is
determined by the corresponding vector at the image of its north pole.

4.5. Two examples from Lie theory.

4.5.1. Regular coadjoint orbits. Let G be a compact, connected Lie group with g
its Lie algebra. The symplectic groupoid (T ∗G, ωcan) is an s-proper integration
of the linear Poisson structure on g∗. The regular set M := g∗
reg, consisting of
those coadjoint orbits with stabilizer a maximal torus, is a regular Poisson mani-
fold of s-proper type and G := (T ∗G)|g∗
reg is a proper symplectic integration,
inducing a transversal integral aﬃne structure ΛG. Compact coadjoint orbits are
1-connected, so our standing assumption holds and the leaf space of g∗
reg is a smooth
integral aﬃne manifold (B, ΛB). In this example, we can relate our previous discus-
sion with some standard facts and constructions from Lie theory (see, e.g., [8, 30]).
We will describe here this relationship, leaving the veriﬁcations to the reader.

⇒ g∗

reg

Fix a maximal torus T ⊂ G and let c ⊂ t∗ be the interior of a Weyl Chamber.
We recall that t is a full slice to the adjoint action of G on g: any regular orbit
intersects t transversely with tangent space [t, g]. Dually, the splitting

g = t ⊕ [t, g]

embeds t∗ into g∗ as a full slice to the coadjoint action. Each regular orbit intersects
c exactly once, so we get a canonical diﬀeomorphism:

G/T × c → g∗

reg

(gT, ξ) 7→ Ad∗

g ξ

(4.10)

Under this diﬀeomorphism, the symplectic form of the orbit through ξ ∈ c is the
unique left G-invariant form ωξ ∈ Ω2(G/T) satisfying at ξ ∼= eT:
u, v ∈ g/t = Tξ(G/T).

ωξ(u, v) = ξ([u, v]),
Let us ﬁx a coadjoint orbit S0 ⊂ g∗

(4.11)
reg through some point ξ0 ∈ c, so that S0 ∼=
G/T. If ΛG = Ker(exp : t → T) and Λw is the weight lattice, we have isomorphisms:

• The leaf space: (B, ΛB) ∼= (c, Λ∨
• The normal space: (νξ0 (S0), ΛG|ξ0) ∼= (t∗, Λ∨
• The cohomology: (H 2(S0), H 2(S0, Z)) ∼= (t∗

decomposition into center and semisimple part, and t = z ⊕ tss.

Explicitly, the last isomorphism associates to an element ξ ∈ t∗
class of the form ωξ given by (4.11), hence we ﬁnd that:

case, the linear variation is an isomorphism of integral vector spaces iﬀ G is the
simply connected integration (cf. Proposition 4.2.3).

In general, the linear variation is not injective and its kernel is precisely z∗. If we

4.5.2. Principal conjugacy classes. Let G be a compact, connected Lie group with
Lie algebra g, let h·, ·i be an Ad-invariant inner product, and let LG the correspond-
ing Cartan-Dirac structure on G with twisting φ the Cartan 3-form [4, 11, 59]. Re-
call that its leaves are the conjugacy classes and an s-proper integration is provided
by the conjugacy action groupoid G ⋉ G endowed with the multiplicative 2-form:

(4.12)

where θL and θR are the left and right-invariant Maurer-Cartan forms. We have
the following basic result, relating (G, LG) and (g∗, πlin) (see [3, Theorem 3.13]):

Proposition 4.5.1. Let exp : g∗ → G be the composition of exp : g → G with
the isomorphism g∗ ∼= g given be the inner product. The pullback Dirac structure
exp∗(LG) is smooth and there is a 2-form χ ∈ Ω2(g∗) giving a gauge transformation:

exp∗(LG) = eχLπlin.

The 2-form χ in the proposition is an Ad∗-invariant, canonical primitive of the

pullback of the Cartan 3-form: exp∗φ = dχ.

Let us now restrict to the regular set Greg ⊂ G, formed by the conjugacy classes
of maximal dimension. We obtain an s-proper presymplectic φ-twisted integration
(G, Ω) = (G ⋉ Greg, ΩG) ⇒ Greg, inducing a transverse integral aﬃne structure ΛG
to the foliation consisting of conjugacy classes in Greg.

We recall that a regular orbit is called principal if its isotropy is connected. A
good example to keep in mind is G = SO(3), whose non-trivial conjugacy classes
are all regular and among these there is only one which is non-principal, namely the
conjugacy class of a non-trivial diagonal matrix. Principal orbits are 1-connected,
and therefore (Gprinc, LG) is a connected regular twisted Dirac manifold of s-proper
type, satisfying our standing assumption. Hence, the leaf leaf space B = Gprinc/G
is a smooth manifold carrying an integral aﬃne structure ΛB such that ΛG = p∗ΛB.
Again, we can relate our previous discussion with some standard facts from the Lie
theory of conjugacy classes of compact Lie groups (see.e.g., [30, 8]).

A maximal torus T ⊂ G is a full slice for the conjugation action, so Treg = T∩Greg
and Tprinc = T∩Gprinc are also slices for the restricted action on Greg and Gprinc. If
K is a connected component of Treg and B is a connected component of Tprinc ∩ K,
then we obtain a diﬀeomorphism:

G/T × B → Gprinc,

(gT, k) 7→ gkg−1,

so B is identiﬁed with the leaf space Gprinc/G.

In general, B is not 1-connected and one can identify its universal cover using
exp : t → T. A choice of positive roots determines a Weyl alcove of g, which is a
connected component a ⊂ t of exp−1(Treg). A Weyl alcove of G is a connected com-
ponent aG ⊂ a of exp−1(Tprinc) and the exponential exp : aG → B gives a covering

map, so that eB = aG. It follows that we have a surjective local diﬀeomorphism:

(gT, ξ) 7→ g exp(ξ)g−1 = exp(Adg ξ),

G/T × aG → Gprinc,

identifying the 2-form on the conjugacy class determined by ξ ∈ aG with:

eχξ + ωξ ∈ Ω2(G/T).

(4.13)

52

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

Here, ωξ is the symplectic form (4.11) and eχξ is the restriction to G/T × {ξ} of the
form eχ ∈ Ω2(G/T × aG) obtained by pulling back the form χ in Proposition 4.5.1

Now ﬁx a conjugacy class S0 ⊂ Gprinc through some point g0 ∈ exp(aG), so that

along the map (4.10).

S0 ∼= G/T. If ΛG = Ker(exp : t → T), Λw is the weight lattice, and

Λ∗

G := {v ∈ t : hv, λi ∈ Z : ∀λ ∈ ΛG},

we ﬁnd isomorphisms:

• (νg0 (S), ΛG|g0 ) ∼= (t, Λ∗
G);
• (H 2(S0), H 2(S0, Z)) ∼= (t∗

ss, Λw).

We conclude that:

(i) The developing map dev0 : eB → νg0 (S0) is the inclusion:

dev0 : (aG, Λ∗

G) ֒→ (t, Λ∗

G);

(ii) The linear variation map varlin

̟ : νg0 (S0) → H 2(S0) is the composition of the
isomorphism t ∼= t∗ given by the inner product, with the projection onto t∗
ss:

varlin

̟ : (t, Λ∗

G) → (t∗

ss, Λw);

and aﬃne variation.

(iii) The pullback to eB = aG of the bundle Hφ of twisted 2-cohomology groups
trivializes and has the ﬂat section ξ 7→ [eχξ], which allows to identify the linear
(iv) The variation map var̟ : eB → H 2(S0) becomes the inclusion:

var̟ : (aG, Λ∗

G) → (t∗, Λ∨

Again, we note that the linear variation is injective iﬀ (Gprinc, LG) is of strong
s-proper type and this happens iﬀ g is semisimple. In this case the linear variation
is an isomorphism of integral vector spaces iﬀ G is the simply connected integration.

w).

5. The linear variation theorem II: the general case

We now extend the results from the previous section to general PMCTs of s-
proper type, removing the assumption that symplectic leaves are 1-connected. The
main diﬀerence is that now the leaf space is an orbifold. We will see how to state
an appropriate version of the linear variation theorem, which will be a statement
that holds on an orbifold bundle made of cohomologies of the symplectic leaves.

5.1. The developing map for transverse integral aﬃne foliations. Since we
do not have a smooth leaf space anymore, we are now forced to work with transverse
integral aﬃne structures. Let us point out how the discussion in Section 4.1, on
the developing map of integral aﬃne manifolds, can be extended to the setting of
transversally integral aﬃne foliations [36, 53, 61].

Given a foliation (M, F ) with a transverse integral aﬃne structure Λ, in the

intrinsic approach to the developing map one now has:

(i) An induced ﬂat connection ∇ on ν(F ) for which the local sections of Λ
are ﬂat. The connection gives rise to a linear holonomy action (by parallel
transport) of Π1(M ) on ν(F ):

hlin : Π1(M ) → GLΛ(ν(F )).

Its image will be denoted by Πlin

1 (M ) ⊂ GLΛ(ν(F )).

PMCT 2

53

(ii) The projection map T M → ν(F ) is an algebroid 1-cocycle and it integrates

to the developing map:

dev : Π1(M ) → ν(F ).

This, together with the linear holonomy action, gives rise to the aﬃne holo-
nomy action

hAﬀ : Π1(M ) → Aﬀ Λ(ν(F )).

Its image will be denoted by ΠAﬀ

1 (M ) ⊂ Aﬀ Λ(ν(F )).

As in Section 4.1, to be more concrete one ﬁxes

• a base point x ∈ M , and
• a Z-basis bΛ = {λ1, . . . , λq} for Λx.

Upon restriction, we obtain the based/classical linear and aﬃne holonomy repre-
sentations (see [36]):

hlin
0

: π1(M, x) → GLZ(Rq),

hAﬀ
0

: π1(M, x) → Aﬀ Z(Rq),

(5.1)

and the based developing map:

which is a π1(M, x)-equivariant integral aﬃne submersion. The images of these rep-
resentations are the linear holonomy group Γlin ⊂ GLZ(Rq) and the aﬃne holonomy
group ΓAﬀ ⊂ Aﬀ Z(Rq).

dev0 : (fM ,eΛ) → (Rq, Zq),

5.2. The linear variation theorem. We assume now that (M, π) is a regular
Poisson structure and (G, Ω) ⇒ M is an s-connected, s-proper integration. We
denote by Λ = ΛG the induced integral transverse integral aﬃne structure and by
B = B(G) the induced integration of Fπ, so we have a short exact sequence of Lie
groupoids:

1

/ ν∗(Fπ)/Λ

/ G

/ B

/ 1 .

We endow B = M/Fπ with the orbifold structure with atlas B (Theorem 2.0.5).

In order to study the variation of the leafwise symplectic forms, we need a better
understanding of the “vector bundle” H → B with ﬁber Hb = H 2(Sb), where the
leafwise symplectic forms live. The problem is that H is now only a set-theoretical
vector bundle and even the ranks of the ﬁbers may vary from point to point! To
solve this problem we should proceed as follows:

• replace H → B by the representation HB → M of B ⇒ M deﬁned by:

HB

x = H 2(B(x, −)),

where the action is the one induced from the right action of B on itself;

• replace Γ(H) by the space Γ(HB)inv consisting of B-invariant sections of
the representation. Note that, while a priori Γ(H) does not make sense,
Γ(HB)inv sits inside the space of set-theoretical sections of H:

Γ(HB)inv ⊂ Γset(H).

The image of this inclusion could be taken as deﬁnition of Γ(H).

The inclusion (5.2) comes from the canonical isomorphisms

(HB

x )Bx−inv ∼= Hb,

(5.2)

(5.3)

valid for all x ∈ M , where b = p(x) and p : M → B is the projection. This holds
because t : B(x, −) → Sb is a Bx-covering projection and the isotropy Bx is ﬁnite.

54

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

In this way, for any invariant section σ of HB, σ(x) makes sense as an element of
Hb. Moreover, for any other y with p(y) = b, there exists an arrow g : x → y in
B and right action by g becomes, after the identiﬁcations (5.3), the identity map
on Hb. The invariance of σ implies that σ(x) ∈ Bb only depends on b, therefore
making sense of σ as a section of H.

Therefore, while (4.3) deﬁnes ̟ only as a set-theoretical section of H, the pre-
vious discussion shows that the same information is obtained by considering the
smooth section

̟ ∈ Γ(HB)inv

which, as a section of HB, is deﬁned by pulling back along the target map of B the
cohomology classes of the leafwise symplectic forms.

Remark 5.2.1 (Orbivector bundles). The previous discussion belongs to the world
of orbivector bundles (see [1, 50] and Remark 2.6.8): an orbivector bundle over the
orbifold (B, B) is given by a linear representation EB → B of the groupoid B. The
bundle HB is, of course, an example. Another example is provided by the tangent
bundle to the orbifold: it is represented by the normal bundle ν(F ) → M of the
foliation on the base, endowed with the linear holonomy action of B.

For any orbivector bundle EB → M over (B, B) its space of (smooth) sections
is deﬁned as Γ(EB)inv. A morphism of orbivector bundles EB
2 (over the
identity) is just a morphism of the representations and it induces a map between
the space of sections Γ(EB

1 → EB

1 )inv → Γ(EB

2 )inv.

The previous remark suggests that the linear variation map T B → H of Section
4.3, should now be replaced by a morphism of orbivector bundles T B → H, i.e.,
a morphism of representations ν∗(Fπ) → HB.
Indeed, using the Gauss-Manin
connection on HB induced by HB

Z , we deﬁne:

Deﬁnition 5.2.2. The linear variation is the morphism of orbivector bundles:

varlin

̟ : ν(Fπ) → HB, v 7→ ∇v̟.

This map should now be seen as a morphism of integral representations of B or,
equivalently, of integral orbivector bundles over B. We also consider the resulting
linear variation space:

(V lin

G).

̟ , V lin

̟,Z) = varlin

̟ (ν(Fπ), Λ∨

We will see that this is an integral vector bundle sitting weakly inside (HB, HB

Z ).

The integral structures make HB and ν(Fπ) also into representations of the

fundamental groupoid Π1(M ) using the holonomy

h∇ : Π1(M ) → GLZ(HB)

induced by ∇ (and similarly for ν(Fπ)). It is not diﬃcult to see that the actions of
B and Π1(M ) on (HB, HB
Z ) are compatible, since we have the commutative diagram:

Π1(M )

O
/
O

PMCT 2

where hB is the submersion associated to the foliation groupoid B and ρB is the
action of B on HB (and similarly for ν(Fπ)).

We can now extend Proposition 4.2.3, Corollary 4.2.4 and then Theorem 4.2.5
to general s-proper Poisson manifolds. We ﬁrst formulate the analogues of Propo-
sition 4.2.3 and Theorem 4.2.5 together. Similar to the null-variation foliation K
introduced there, we now deﬁne KM ⊂ T M by

Ker(varlin

̟ ) = KM /Fπ ⊂ ν(Fπ).

One should also recall the B-monodromy groups NB associated with any foliation
groupoid B integrating (M, Fπ), introduced in Section 3.4.

Theorem 5.2.3. If G is an s-connected, s-proper integration of (M, π) then:

(i) varlin

̟ is a Π1(M )-equivariant morphism of integral vector bundles,

varlin

̟ : (ν(Fπ), Λ∨

G) → (HB, HB
Z )

with kernel N 0

B and image (V lin

(ii) KM is an integrable distribution and NB ⊂ ν∗(KM ) deﬁnes a transverse inte-

gral aﬃne structure for KM .

(iii) every leaf eK of KM is a Poisson submanifold of (M, π) saturated by symplectic

leaves and (eK, π| eK) is of s-proper type with zero-variation.

(iv) for any transversal T to KM of complementary dimension its saturation MT
with respect to the symplectic foliation is a Poisson submanifold of s-proper
type with full-variation. It is of strong s-proper type if Nmon|T is a lattice.

Proof. The Π1(M )-invariance is a consequence of the integrality varlin
G ) ⊂ HB
which we now prove. We use the B-variation map ∂B whose image is precisely NB
(see Section 3.4). By exactly the same arguments as in Proposition 4.2.2, one has

̟ (Λ∨

Z

hvarlin

̟ (v), αi = ∂B(α)(v),

∀ v ∈ νx(Fπ), α ∈ H2(B(x, −), Z).

(5.4)

Starting now with v ∈ νx(Fπ), we have:

varlin

̟ (v) ∈ H 2(B(x, −), Z) ⇐⇒ hvarlin

̟ (v), αi ∈ Z, ∀ α ∈ H2(B(x, −), Z)

⇐⇒ ∂B,x(α)(v) ∈ Z, ∀ α ∈ H2(B(x, −), Z)
⇐⇒ λ(v) ∈ Z, ∀ λ ∈ NB,x
⇐⇒ v ∈ N ∨
B .

In other words one has the analogue of (4.6):

(varlin

̟ )−1(HB

(cid:3)

56

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

The analogue of Corollary 4.2.4 (i), concerning zero-variation, holds without any
further complications, once one makes precise sense of the notion of symplectic
ﬁbration over an orbifold- which we leave as an exercise for the reader.

The analogue of Corollary 4.2.4 (ii) states that the full-variation condition (i.e.
the injectivity of varlin
̟ ) is equivalent to the fact that NB is a lattice in ν∗(Fπ). This
holds, by Theorem 5.2.3 (i). One ﬁnds this situation, for example, in the strong
s-proper case when NB = Nmon (but not only then!). Whenever the full-variation
condition holds one obtains that

V lin

̟,Z = V lin

̟ ∩ HB
Z .

This shows that the full-variation condition does not depend on the integrating
groupoid. It can also be seen as an immediate consequence of the fact that for any
ﬁnite covering the pull-back map in (real) cohomology is injective.

Finally, we can look at the variation of ̟ and again prove its linear nature. First

of all, similar to the previous section, we now have a variation map:

[γ] 7→ γ∗̟γ(1).
On the other hand, we also have the aﬃne version of varlin
̟ :

var̟ : Π1(M ) → HB,

varAﬀ

̟ : ν(Fπ) → HB,

and its image:

v 7→ varAﬀ

̟ (v) := ̟ + varlin

̟ (v),

V Aﬀ

̟ := ̟ + V lin

̟ ⊂ HB.

For the statement of the linear variation theorem we use ν(Fπ) and its structure
of integral aﬃne representation of Π1(M ) (see Section 5.1), or in the terminology
of Remark 4.4.2, with the structure of ﬂat integral aﬃne bundle.
In order to
emphasize this structure, we will use the notation νAﬀ (Fπ). Moreover, we also use
the developing dev : Π1(M ) → ν(Fπ) associated to the transverse integral aﬃne
structure (see Section 5.1):

Theorem 5.2.4. The image of the variation map var̟ is contained in V Aﬀ
̟ : νAﬀ (Fπ) → V Aﬀ

In particular, V Aﬀ

̟ is a Π1(M )-invariant weak integral aﬃne sub-bundle of HB.

The proof follows exactly the same arguments as in Theorem 4.3.2, and so it will

be omitted.

More explicit descriptions, as in Corollary 4.3.4, can be obtained by ﬁxing a
base point x ∈ M and a Z-basis bΛ = {λ1, . . . , λq} for Λx. Then bΛ induces an
identiﬁcation of G0
x with the standard torus Tq, so the projection G(x, −) → B(x, −)
becomes a principal Tq-bundle. We can then consider its Chern classes

where we set ¯S := B(x, −). As in Corollary 4.3.4, we denote by

c1, . . . , cq ∈ H 2( ¯S, Z) = HB

Z,x.

the ﬁber of V lin
obtains the following extension of Corollary 4.3.4:

variations of ̟:

̟ at x and by dev0 : fM → Rq the resulting developing map. One

V lin
0 = SpanR(c1, . . . , cq), V lin

0,Z = SpanZ(c1, . . . , cq).

In the strong s-proper case, the classes c1, . . . , cq are linearly independent and they
form a primitive family, i.e., we have

SpanZ(c1, . . . , cq) = SpanR(c1, . . . , cq) ∩ H 2( ¯S, Z).

Moreover, for any path γ in M starting at x one has

γ∗([ωγ(1)]) = [ωx] + dev1

One also has analogous results for twisted DMCTs with the appropriate modiﬁ-

cations. We leave the statements to reader and discuss an interesting example.

5.3. Examples.

5.3.1. The classical Duistermaat-Heckman theorem. The linear variation of coho-
mology, given by Theorems 4.3.2 and 5.2.4, or their more explicit versions Corol-
laries 4.3.4 and 5.2.5, are the global versions of a famous result of Duistermaat and
Heckman [29]: if a torus T acts freely on a symplectic manifold S in a Hamiltonian
fashion then, in the integral aﬃne coordinates of t∗, the cohomology classes of the
reduced spaces vary linearly with slopes the Chern classes.

More precisely, we can recover the classical Duistermaat-Heckman theorem as
follows. Given a free Hamiltonian T-action on a connected symplectic manifold
(S, ω) with moment map µ : S → t∗ we consider the Poisson manifold M = S/T,
whose symplectic leaves are precisely the symplectic reduced spaces Sξ = µ−1(ξ)/T
(see Appendix A.2). This kind of Poisson manifolds furnish examples of PMCTs,
and were discussed in detail in [20, Section 5.4]: there it is shown that if µ is proper,
then an s-connected, s-proper symplectic integration is:

G = (S ×µ S)/T ⇒ S/T,

with symplectic form Ω induced from pr∗

1 ω − pr∗

2 ω.

Now observe that for this symplectic integration (G, Ω) ⇒ S/T:

• the induced orbifold structure on the leaf space B = µ(S) ⊂ t∗ is the

submersion groupoid B(G) = S/T ×µ S/T, so it is smooth;

• the induced integral aﬃne structure on t∗ is the canonical integral aﬃne

structure Λ for which T = t∗/Λ;

• the s-ﬁber of G through a point in Sξ is (isomorphic to) the principal T-

bundle µ−1(ξ) → Sξ.

/
/
 
=
58

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

Since the orbifold B(G) is actually smooth, Theorem 5.2.4 (respectively, Corollary
5.2.5), reduces to its smooth version, Theorem 4.3.2 (respectively, Corollary 4.3.4).
The conclusion is that the cohomology class [ωξ] of the symplectic form of the
symplectic reduced space Sξ = µ−1(ξ)/T satisﬁes:

[ωξ] = [ωξ0] + hc, ξ − ξ0i,

where c ∈ H 2(Sξ0 , Λ) is the Chern class of the principal T-bundle µ−1(ξ0) → Sξ0.
This is precisely the classical result of Duistermaat and Heckman [29].

Actually, in their paper Duistermaat and Heckman allow for non-free actions,
which leads to symplectic reduced spaces µ−1(ξ)/T which are orbifolds. It is not
hard to see that our work on PMCTs can be extended to Poisson orbifolds, which
allow to treat the non-free case. Moreover, our approach extends to the non-regular
case [21], showing that s-proper Poisson manifolds provide the right setting for the
globalization of the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem.

5.3.2. Regular conjugacy classes. Let us return to the Cartan-Dirac structure on
a compact, connected Lie group G discussed in Section 4.5.2, and look now at
all the regular conjugacy classes. While the principal orbits are 1-connected, the
regular non-principal orbits are not. As before, (Greg, LG) is a regular φ-twisted
Dirac structure, with an s-connected, s-proper integration provided by the φ-twisted
presymplectic groupoid G ⋉ Greg. It induces a transverse aﬃne structure ΛG to the
foliation FLG made of the regular conjugacy classes and its leaf space B = Greg/G
is now an integral aﬃne orbifold.

The orbifold structure on B is determined by the foliation groupoid B in the

sequence (see Theorem 2.0.5):

1

/ ν∗(FLG)/Λ

/ G ⋉ Greg

/ B

/ 1

We claim that B is the holonomy groupoid of FLG or, equivalently, that the action
of B on Greg is eﬀective. In fact, if (g, x) ∈ G ⋉ Greg maps to h ∈ B, then the (local)
action of h is the one of the bisection {g} × Greg of G ⋉ Greg. This (local) action
is trivial iﬀ g ∈ Z(G). Since the center is the intersection of all maximal tori, the
arrow h ∈ B must be a unit.

The universal cover of Greg is given by

G/T × a → Greg,

(gT, ξ) 7→ g exp(ξ)g−1 = exp(Adg ξ),

(5.5)

where a is a Weyl alcove for g, with covering group the quotient of the aﬃne Weyl
groups (see [8]):

Γ = π1(Greg) = W Aﬀ

G /W Aﬀ .

One has π1(Greg) = π1(G), so there is a covering group Glin → G whose regular
part is the holonomy cover of (Greg, FLG). Hence, the linear holonomy group is:

Γlin = π1(Greg)/π1(Glin) = W Aﬀ

G /W Aﬀ
Glin.

The covering map (5.5) allows us to identify the twisted symplectic 2-forms on
the leaves (conjugacy classes) by the same formula (4.13). In fact, the analysis of
the regular part of G is essentially the analysis of the principal part of Glin discussed
in Section 4.5.2. If we ﬁx a non-principal conjugacy class S0 ⊂ Greg\Gprinc through
some point g0 ∈ exp(a), we have ¯S0 = B(g0, −) ∼= G/T and, again, we ﬁnd:

• (νg0 (S0), ΛG|g0 ) ∼= (t, Λ∗
G);
• (H 2( ¯S0), H 2( ¯S0, Z)) ∼= (t∗

ss, Λw).

We conclude:

(i) B is an orbifold quotient of the integral aﬃne manifold Blin = a/Γlin (endowed

with integral aﬃne structure Λ∗

G);

(ii) The developing map dev0 : eGreg → νg0 (S0) is now given by:

dev0 : (G/T × a, Λ∗

G) → (t, Λ∗

G),

where one ﬁrst projects onto a and then takes the inclusion.

(iii) The linear variation varlin

̟ : νg0 (S0) → H 2( ¯S0) is the identiﬁcation t ∼= t∗ given

by the inner product followed by the projection onto the semisimple factor

(iv) The pullback to eGreg = G/T × a of the bundle HB of twisted 2-cohomology
groups trivializes and has the ﬂat section ξ 7→ [eχξ], which allows to identify
(v) After the previous identiﬁcation, the variation map var̟ : eGreg → H 2( ¯S0)

becomes the projection to a, followed by the inclusion in t, the identiﬁcation
t ∼= t∗, and then the projection onto the semisimple factor:

var̟ : (G/T × a, Λ∗

G) → (t∗

6. Measures and the Duistermaat-Heckman formula

Another fundamental property of PMCTs is the existence of natural invariant
volume forms/measures. Given a regular Poisson manifold of proper type (M, π)
and an s-connected, proper integration (G, Ω) ⇒ M we will see that the leaf space
B = M/Fπ carries a natural measure. The basic idea is simple: an integral aﬃne
structure gives rise to a density, hence to a measure. However, since B is an
orbifold we need a bit of care with the role of the groupoid in this construction.
The outcome will be that any s-connected, proper integration (G, Ω) induces a
measure on B, called the integral aﬃne measure induced by (G, Ω) and denoted
µG
Aﬀ (we omit the dependence in Ω in the notation, but the reader should keep in
mind that this construction depends on having a proper symplectic integration).

In the s-proper case there is yet another natural measure on B: the one obtained
by pushing down the Liouville measure associated to the symplectic form Ω. One
obtains a measure on B, called the Duistermaat-Heckman measure induced
by (G, Ω) and denoted by µG
Aﬀ and
µG
DH can be described via a Duistermaat-Heckman formula, involving the volumes
of the symplectic leaves.

DH. As we shall see, the relationship between µG

6.1. Measures on leaf spaces. We start by ﬁxing some notations and terminol-
ogy. First of all, by a measure on a locally compact Hausdorﬀ space X we mean
here a Radon measure in the sense of a positive linear functional

µ : Cc(X) → R

deﬁned on the space Cc(X) of compactly supported continuous function on X.
Although we will not use set-measures, it is still handy to use the notation

µ(f ) =ZX

f (x) dµ(x).

When M is a smooth manifold one can use C∞

c (M ) instead of Cc(M ). Moreover,
in this case one can talk about geometric measures: if Dc(M ) denotes the space

of compactly supported sections of the density bundle DM = | ∧top T ∗M |, then
each density ρ ∈ D(M ) = Γ(M, DM ) induces a linear functional

µρ : C∞

c (M ) → R, µρ(f ) :=ZM

f ρ,

which is a measure whenever ρ is positive. When M is an oriented manifold, we
can use the orientation to identify DM with ∧topT ∗M , hence to integrate top forms
instead of densities.

An integral aﬃne structure Λ on a manifold M induces a density ρΛ: locally, if

λ1, . . . , λn is a coframe that spans Λ ⊂ T ∗M , then
ρΛ = |λ1 ∧ . . . λn|.

Of course, if M is oriented, then one case use oriented coframes to obtain a volume
form ηΛ and ρΛ = |ηΛ|.

Notice that forms, densities or measures on manifolds give sheaves

X 7→ Ω•(X), D(X), or M(X)

to which one can apply Haeﬂiger’s transverse geometry approach (see Remarks
2.3.3 and 2.6.8). This leads to well-deﬁned notions of diﬀerential forms Ω•(B, B),
densities D(B, B) and measures Morbi(B, B) on any orbifold (B, B): if E ⇒ T is an
´etale orbifold atlas then one considers invariant forms Ω•(T )E , invariant densities
D(T )E and invariant measures M(T )E . It is easy to see that, in these cases, the
resulting objects depend only on the underlying classical orbifold.

The following shows that Morbi(B, B) can be identiﬁed with M(B)- the space

ordinary of measures on the locally compact Hausdorﬀ space B.

Lemma 6.1.1. Given a ´etale orbifold atlas E ⇒ T with quotient map p : T → B,
there is a 1-1 correspondence:

{measures µ on B} 1−1←→ {E − invariant measures eµ on T }.

Explicitly, it is uniquely determined by eµ = µ ◦ p!, where
c (B), p!(f )(p(x)) = Xg∈s−1(x)

f (t(g)).

p! : C∞

c (T ) → C∞

Remark 6.1.2. It is instructive to realize that, in the resulting bijection

M(B) ∼= Morbi(B, B),

the left hand side depends only on the topological space B, the right hand side
depends only on the classical orbifold underlying (B, B), but the isomorphism de-
pends on the full orbifold structure (p! above depends on E !). A simple but already
illustrative example is obtained when B is a smooth manifold but we endow it with
a non-smooth orbifold structure with orbifold atlas B := Γ ⋉ B ⇒ B, where Γ
is a ﬁnite group acting trivially on B; while Morbi(B, B) = M(B), the previous
isomorphism introduces a factor |Γ|, the cardinality of Γ.

More generally, this discussion extends to any foliation groupoid E ⇒ M , so one
can talk about E-transverse forms, E-transverse densities and E-transverse mea-
sures: one considers invariant forms Ω•(T )ET , invariant densities D(T )ET and in-
variant measures M(T )ET , where T ⊂ M is any complete transversal to the E-orbit
foliation. Of course, for a proper foliation (M, F ) the structures on the orbifold
B = M/F coincide with the transverse structures on (M, F ).

For any foliation groupoid E ⇒ M there is a 1:1 correspondence:

(cid:26) E-transverse forms

ρT ∈ Ω•(T )ET

(cid:27) 1−1←→(cid:26) invariant sections
ρν ∈ Γ(∧•ν∗(F ) (cid:27)

where by “invariant” we mean invariant under linear holonomy, i.e., satisfying:

∇X ρν = 0, ∀X ∈ X(F ),

where ∇ is the Bott connection. Similarly, for densities we have:

(cid:26) E-transverse densities

ρT ∈ D(T )ET

(cid:27) 1−1←→(cid:26) invariant sections

ρν ∈ Γ(Dν )

(cid:27)

where Dν = | ∧top ν∗(F )|. These correspondences are obtained by considering the
Morita equivalence:

For each g ∈ s−1(T ), we obtain an isomorphism:

dgt

νg(s−1(s(g)))

dg s

/ Ts(g)T .

The isomorphisms determined by two arrows with the same source and target diﬀer
by the action of an element of E on the normal space to the orbit, i.e., the linear
holonomy action. This gives the desired 1-1 correspondence between elements ρT ∈
Ω•(T )ET and invariant sections ρν ∈ Γ(∧topν∗(F )).

Using this correspondence, we conclude:

Proposition 6.1.3. Let E ⇒ M be a proper foliation groupoid integrating F . Each
transverse integral aﬃne structure Λ ⊂ ν∗(F ) determines a measure µAﬀ on the
orbifold M/F which is represented by the invariant density ρν
Aﬀ ∈ Γ(Dν) given by:

where λ1, . . . , λn is any basis of Λx.

ρν
Aﬀ |x = |λ1 ∧ . . . λn|,

Lemma 6.1.1 tells us how to compute the resulting integrals by working on a
transversal, but it is desirable to work directly at the level of M . For that, observe
that the short exact sequence:

0

/ T F

/ T M

/ ν(F )

/ 0

induces an isomorphism between the associated density bundles:

So we can decompose any invariant density ρν ∈ Γ(Dν) as:

Dν ≃ DT ∗F ⊗ DM .

ρν = ρ∗

F ⊗ ρM ,

where ρF is a density along the leaves of F and ρM is a density on M .

Proposition 6.1.4. Let E ⇒ M be a proper foliation groupoid integrating F . If
µB is a geometric measure on the orbifold B = M/F represented by an invariant
density ρν ∈ Γ(Dν), then for any f ∈ C∞

c (M ) one has:

ZM

f (x) dµM (x) =ZB(cid:18)ι(b)ZSb

f (y) dµSb(y)(cid:19) dµB(b),

where µSb is the measure on the leaf Sb and µM the measure on M associated with
any decomposition ρν = ρ∗
F ⊗ ρM , while ι : B → N is the function that for each
b ∈ B counts the number of elements of the isotropy group Ex (x ∈ Sb).

Proof. First we claim that it is enough to prove the theorem in the case where
(M, F ) admits a complete transversal T which intersects each orbit a ﬁnite number
of times. In fact, recall that proper groupoids admit invariant partitions of unit,
so it is enough to proof the theorem in the case where M is the saturation of a
small enough transversal T to some orbit. Since the leaves of a proper groupoid
are embedded and the leaf space is Hausdorﬀ, we can choose the small transverse
T so that it intersects each orbit on a ﬁnite set. This proves the claim.

Now assume that we have ﬁxed a µB is a geometric measure on the orbifold
B = M/F represented by an invariant density ρν ∈ Γ(Dν ), and that we have
chosen some decomposition ρν = ρ∗
F ⊗ ρM . We consider the Morita equivalence
(6.1). Since t : s−1(T ) → M is a local diﬀeomorphism, on the space s−1(T ) we
have the pullback density t∗ρM . We pick some f ∈ C∞
c (M ) and we compute the
integral:

Zs−1(T )

1

|E(t(g), T )|

f (t(g)) dt∗µM (g),

in two diﬀerent ways:

(i) If we apply ﬁber integration along the proper submersion t : s−1(T ) → M , we

obtain:

Zs−1(T )

1

|E(t(g), T )|

f (t(g)) dt∗µM (g) =ZM

f (x) dµM (x).

(ii) If we apply ﬁber integration along the proper submersion s : s−1(T ) → T , we

obtain:

Zs−1(T )

1

|E(t(g), T )|

f (t(g)) dt∗µM (g) =Zs−1(T )

1

|E(t(g), T )|

f (t(g)) (t∗ρF ⊗ t∗ρν )(g)

1

=ZT 
=ZT(cid:18) |Ex|

|E(x, T )|Zs−1(x)
|E(x, T )|ZSx

f (t(g)) dµs−1(x)(g)! dµT (x)
f (y) dµSx(y)(cid:19) dµT (x),

where we ﬁrst used that ρM = ρν ⊗ ρF and then that t restricts to a cover on
each ﬁber s−1(x) with covering group Ex. Using Lemma 6.1.1, we conclude
that:

Zs−1(T )

1

|E(t(g), T )|

f (t(g)) dt∗µM (g) =ZB(cid:18)ι(b)ZSb

f (y) dµSx(y)(cid:19) dµB(b),

where ι(b) = |Ex| for any x with p(x) = b.

Putting (i) and (ii) together the proposition follows.

6.2. A Weyl type integration formula. Let (M, π) be a regular Poisson mani-
fold. The leafwise symplectic form gives the leafwise Liouville volume form:

ωtop
Fπ
top!

∈ Ωtop(Fπ).

This induces a 1:1 correspondence between top degree forms η ∈ Ωtop(M ) and
sections ην ∈ Γ(∧topν∗(Fπ)) by setting:

η =

ωtop
Fπ
top!

⊗ ην .

It turns out that under this correspondence the transverse invariant densities/volu-
me forms correspond to the Hamiltonian invariant densities/volume forms in (M, π),
in the sense of the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 6.2.1. A Hamiltonian invariant volume form/density/measure
µ on a Poisson manifold (M, π) is any volume form/density/measure η on M which
is invariant under the ﬂow of any Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld Xh, i.e.:

£Xh η = 0,

∀h ∈ C∞(M ).

In fact, we have:

Proposition 6.2.2. For a regular Poisson manifold (M, π) the assignment η 7→ ην
gives a 1-1 correspondence between:

(i) Hamiltonian invariant volume forms η ∈ Ωtop(M ),
(ii) transverse volume forms ην ∈ Γ(∧topν∗(Fπ)).

Proof. It is immediate to check that if η =

ωtop
top! ⊗ ην , then:
Fπ

£Xh η =

ωtop
Fπ
top!

⊗ ∇Xh ην,

so the result follows.

(cid:3)

A similar discussion holds for densities where one replaces the foliated volume

form ωtop
Fπ

by the foliated density |ωtop
Fπ

|.

Let now (G, Ω) be an s-connected, proper integration of a Poisson manifold
It gives rise to a transverse integral aﬃne structure Λ ⊂ ν∗(Fπ) and
(M, π).
an orbifold structure B(G) on B = M/Fπ. Hence, we obtain (see Propositions 6.1.3
and 6.2.2):

• a integral aﬃne measure µAﬀ on the orbifold (B, B(G));
• a integral aﬃne transverse density ρν
• a Hamiltonian invariant density ρM on (M, π) corresponding to ρν

Aﬀ on (M, Fπ) representing µAﬀ ;
Aﬀ .
The integral aﬃne transverse density and the Hamiltonian invariant density are
related by:

ρM :=

|

|ωtop
Fπ
top!

⊗ ρν

Aﬀ .

(6.2)

The resulting measure µM on M is an incarnation of the integral aﬃne measure
µAﬀ on B at the level of M .

As a consequence of Proposition 6.1.4, we obtain:

Theorem 6.2.3. Given an s-connected, proper integration (G, Ω) of a regular Pois-
son manifold (M, π), one has for any f ∈ C∞

c (M ),

ZM

f (x) dµM (x) =ZB(cid:18)ι(b)ZSb

f (y) dµSb(y)(cid:19) dµAﬀ (b),

where µSb is the Liouville measure of the symplectic leaf Sb, and ι : B → N is the
function that for each b ∈ B counts the number of connected components of the
isotropy group Gx (x ∈ Sb).

Proof. The result follows immediately by applying Proposition 6.1.4 to the foliation
groupoid B(G) associated with G in the short exact sequence (see Theorem 2.6.9):

1

/ T (G)

/ G

/ B(G)

/ 1 ,

where T (G) is the bundle of Lie groups consisting of the identity connected com-
ponents of the isotropy Lie groups Gx. Notice that |B(G)x| is exactly the number
of connected components of Gx.
(cid:3)

In the s-proper case the leaves are compact, hence they have ﬁnite symplectic

volume, and we obtain:

Corollary 6.2.4. If (G, Ω) is an s-connected, s-proper integration of a regular
Poisson manifold (M, π), then for any h ∈ C∞

c (B):

ZM

h(p(x)) dµM (x) =ZB

ι(b) vol(Sb) h(b) dµAﬀ (b),

where vol(Sb) is the symplectic volume of Sb, and ι : B → N is the function that
for each b ∈ B counts the number of connected components of the isotropy group
Gx (x ∈ Sb).

If G is a compact, connected Lie group with Lie algebra g and T is a maximal

torus, Weyl’s integration formula asserts that there is an isomorphism:

C∞(g) ∼= C∞

c (G/T × t)W f (x) 7→ F (gT, u) := f (Ad(g)(u))|det(Ad u)g/t|,

and for ﬁxed Ad-invariant measures µg and µt:

Z f (x)µg(x) =

1

|W |Zt ZG/T

f (Ad(g)(u))µg/t(gT)! |det(Ad u)g/t|µt(u).

Here W = N (T)/T denotes the the Weyl group. In [21] we shall prove that Weyl’s
formula is the result of specializing to (g∗, πlin) (with integration (T ∗G, ωcan)) an
integration formula generalizing Corollary 6.2.4 for arbitrary Poisson manifolds of
s-proper type.

6.3. The Duistermaat-Heckman measure. The discussion above was valid for
general PMCTs. When the Poisson manifold is s-proper there is another natural
measure associated with the PMCT: if (G, Ω) is an s-proper integration of (M, π),
then it is natural to consider the measure on B = M/G obtained as the push-forward
of the Liouville measure µΩ:

along the proper map pB := p ◦ s = p ◦ t : G → B. We will show that:

µDH := (pB)∗(µΩ)

Theorem 6.3.1. If (G, Ω) is an s-connected, s-proper integration of (M, π) then

µDH = (ι · vol)2µAﬀ ,

(6.3)

where vol : B → R is the leafwise symplectic volume function and ι : B → N
counts the number of connected components of the isotropy group of a symplectic
leaf. Moreover, (ι · vol)2 is a polynomial for the orbifold integral aﬃne structure.

Example 6.3.2. In order to recover the classical Duistermaat-Heckman measure,
one proceeds as in Section 5.3.1.

Consider a free Hamiltonian T-action on a connected symplectic manifold (S, ω)
with a proper moment map µ : S → t∗, so that M = S/T is a Poisson manifold with
leaf space µ(S) ⊂ t∗. As we observed in Section 5.3.1, the s-connected, s-proper
symplectic integration G = (S ×µ S)/T induces on t∗ the integral aﬃne structure
Λ for which T = t∗/Λ. Hence, the integral aﬃne measure µAﬀ on the leaf space
is the usual Lebesgue measure on t∗. On the other hand, µDH coincides with the
pushforward of the Liouville measure ωtop/n! under the moment map µ : S → t∗,
i.e.
the classical Duistermaat-Heckman measure. Applying Theorem 6.3.1, we
recover the polynomial nature of the classical Duistermaat-Heckman measure on t∗
[29].

The rest of this section is devoted to the proof of the theorem. First, assuming
(6.3) to hold, we show that (ι·vol)2 is a polynomial in (B, Λ). Note that its pullback
to M is a Casimir. Another Casimir, which we know to be a polynomial on (B, Λ)
by Theorem 5.2.4, is the function p∗ vol2
B, associating to a leaf Sx the square of the
symplectic volume of B(x, −). We now have two non-zero Casimirs which on each
leaf diﬀer by an integer multiple; therefore their ratio is a constant.

Now we turn to the proof of (6.3). First of all, recall that the push-forward of
measures is deﬁned whenever we have a proper map p : P → B between locally
compact Hausdorﬀ spaces: it is the map given by

p∗ : M(P ) → D(B), (p∗µ)(f ) = µP (f ◦ p).

or in the integral formula notation:

ZB

f (b) d(p∗µ)(b) =ZP

f (p(x)) dµ(x).

When p : P → B is a proper submersion this operation transforms geometric
measures into geometric measures, and amounts to ﬁber integration of densities:

p! =Zp−ﬁbers

: Dc(P ) → Dc(B).

More precisely, the short exact sequence induced by the dp : T P → T B yields, for
each x ∈ P , a canonical decomposition:

DP,x ∼= Dp

x ⊗ DB,p(x)

where Dp is the bundle of densities along the ﬁbers of p. Hence, given ρ ∈ D(P ),
for any b ∈ B we can view the restriction ρ|p−1(b) as an element of D(p−1(b)) ⊗ DB,b
and one can integrate along the ﬁber to obtain:

p!(ρ)(b) :=Zp−1(b)

ρ|p−1(b) ∈ DB,b.

By Fubini’s theorem we conclude that p∗(µρ) = µp!(ρ).

66

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

We apply this to an s-connected, s-proper integration (G, Ω) of (M, π). The
Duistermaat-Heckman density µDH = p∗s∗(µΩ) can be understood in two steps.
The ﬁrst one is integration along the s-ﬁbers giving rise to a density on M :

Lemma 6.3.3. µM

DH is an invariant measure.

Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds Xf and Xs∗f are s-related and we have:

£Xf µM

DH =Zs

|Ωn|

(cid:3)

The second step is to push-forward the measure µM

resulting in µDH = p∗µM
the proof of Theorem 6.3.1 is completed by proving the following:

DH along the map p : M → B,
DH. Since Theorem 6.2.3 shows that p∗(µM ) = ι · vol ·µAﬀ ,

Lemma 6.3.4. One has ρM

Proof. We ﬁx a point x ∈ M , we denote by S the leaf through x and let

p = dim(S), q = dim(νx(Fπ)), n = p + q.

For any g ∈ G the short exact sequence:

gives a canonical isomorphism

DTg G ∼= DTg (s−1(x)) ⊗ DTxM .
This leads to a decomposition of the Liouville density

For that we have to unravel the construction of ηg, which goes via the decomposi-

for TgG with the following properties:
(a) X 1, . . . , X n is a basis of Ker(dgs);
(b) X p+1 =

As we shall show in [21] Theorem 6.3.1 holds for arbitrary Poisson manifolds of
s-proper type. In fact, the polynomial (ι · vol)2 will play a fundamental role in the
study of global properties of non-regular Poisson manifolds of s-proper type [21].

Remark 6.3.5. This section is related to Weinstein’s work on measures on stacks
[64]. According to his philosophy, the measures to consider in Poisson Geometry
should arise by interpreting the symplectic groupoid as a stack. Our approach here
is more direct approach, using the foliation groupoid instead of the full symplectic
one. The precise relationship between the two is explained in [23].

7. Proper isotropic realizations

Many algebraic or geometric objects can be studied via their representations.
This philosophy also applies to Poisson Geometry, where the representations of a
Poisson manifold take the concrete form of symplectic realizations (see below). For
instance, the integrability of a Poisson manifold is equivalent to the existence of a
complete symplectic realization [18]. In this section we show that the properness of
a Poisson manifold is closely related to the existence of proper isotropic realizations.
More precisely, to any proper isotropic realization q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) we
will associate a symplectic integration of (M, π)- the holonomy symplectic groupoid
relative to X, denoted by HolX (M, π). It is the smallest integration that acts on
X symplectically and it will play an import role in the last two sections of the
paper. There we will introduce the Lagrangian Dixmier-Douady class of a proper
integration and the ones with vanishing class are precisely the holonomy symplectic
groupoids relative to some proper isotropic realization.

Proper isotropic realizations appeared ﬁrst in the work of Dazord and Delzant
[26], under the name of symplectically complete isotropic ﬁbrations, as special ﬁ-
brations of symplectic manifolds that generalize Lagrangian ﬁbrations. From that
point of view, this section generalizes the fact that the base of a proper Lagrangian
ﬁbration inherits an integral aﬃne structure: we will show that the base of a proper
symplectically complete isotropic ﬁbration with connected ﬁbers is a Poisson ma-
nifold of proper type.

7.1. Symplectic realizations and Hamiltonian G-spaces. Recall that a sym-
plectic realization of a Poisson manifold (M, π) is a symplectic manifold (X, ΩX )
together with a Poisson submersion

q : (X, ΩX) → (M, π).

The symplectic realization is called complete if for any complete Hamiltonian
vector ﬁeld Xh ∈ X(M ) the pullback Xh◦q ∈ X(X) is complete. Of course, if q
is proper then it is complete. While every Poisson manifold admits a symplectic
realization, for complete symplectic realizations one has:

Theorem 7.1.1 ([18]). A Poisson manifold is integrable if and only if it admits a
complete symplectic realization.

Note however that, as the canonical integration Σ(M, π) may already fail to be
Hausdorﬀ, in the previous theorem one has to allow for non-Hausdorﬀ symplectic
realizations (cf. [18, Remark 1]). However, we will soon impose conditions that
ensure that all the manifolds involved are Hausdorﬀ.

We recall in Appendix A that for a symplectic integration (G, Ω) ⇒ (M, π)
the moment map of an inﬁnitesimally free Hamiltonian G-space (X, ΩX ) yields a
symplectic realization of (M, π). This motivates:

Deﬁnition 7.1.2. Given a symplectic realization q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π), a sym-
plectic integration (G, Ω) ⇒ (M, π) is called X-compatible if there is a symplectic
G-action with moment map q : X → M :

Every complete symplectic realization admits compatible integrations: the proof
of Theorem 7.1.1 given in [18] shows that the Weinstein groupoid acts on every
complete symplectic realization. In fact, we have (see also Appendix A):

Proposition 7.1.3. For a Poisson manifold (M, π), the complete symplectic real-
izations of (M, π) are the same thing as the moment maps of inﬁnitesimally free
Σ(M, π)-Hamiltonian spaces.

It will be useful to recall the construction from [18], that shows how the inﬁni-

tesimal action determined by the realization q : (X, ΩX) → (M, π):

σ : q∗T ∗M → X(X),

iσ(α)(ω) = q∗α,

integrates to a symplectic action:

For that, let a : I → T ∗M be a cotangent path with base path γa : I → M and
choose u ∈ X in the ﬁber over the initial point γ(0). Since q is complete, it follows

a (t)) = γa(t) and satisfying:

We call eγu

a the horizontal lift of the cotangent path a with initial point u.
It is easy to check that the horizontal lifts are leafwise paths in the symplectic
orthogonal foliation (ker dq)⊥. It is proved in [18] that two cotangent paths with
the same initial point are cotangent homotopic if and only if their horizontal lifts
are leafwise homotopic relative to the endpoints (and if this holds for some initial
point u it holds for any other point in the ﬁber).

In summary, one can characterize the canonical integration Σ(M, π) ⇒ M from

the realization q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) as:

Σ(M, π) =

{cotangent paths a : I → T ∗M }

cotangent paths w/ lifts leafwise homotopic in (ker dq)⊥ .

(7.1)

If we denote by [a] the class of a cotangent path, the symplectic action of Σ(M, π)
on q : X → M is then given by:

The action gives an isomorphism of Lie groupoids:

Since Σ(M, π) ⇒ M acts on any symplectic realization and it is the largest,

s-connected, symplectic integration of (M, π), it is natural to wonder:

• Given a symplectic realization q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π), is there is a “smallest”

X-compatible, s-connected, symplectic integration?

The minimality property of the holonomy groupoid of a foliation suggests that, to
construct such a groupoid, one should replace in the description (7.1) of Σ(M, π)
“homotopy” by “holonomy”.

the concatenations a0 · b0 and a1 · b1, if deﬁned, are cotangent holonomic

Therefore, we are led to the following:

Deﬁnition 7.1.4. The holonomy symplectic groupoid relative to q : (X, ΩX ) →

HolX (M, π) :=

In good cases HolX (M, π) will indeed be the “smallest” X-compatible integration
of (M, π) and the last morphism will be an isomorphism of Lie groupoids.

Example 7.1.5. For any symplectic groupoid (G, Ω) ⇒ (M, π), the target map
t : G → M yields a complete symplectic realization of (M, π). We claim that in this
case we have a natural isomorphism:

7.2. The holonomy groupoid relative to an isotropic realization. In gen-
eral, for a proper Poisson manifold (M, π) the canonical integration Σ(M, π) ⇒
M will fail to be proper. For a symplectic realization, the holonomy groupoid
HolX (M, π) constructed in the previous section is a smaller integration with better
chances of being proper. When HolX (M, π) is a proper symplectic groupoid then,
according to Theorem 3.3.1, it will determine a transverse integral aﬃne structure
on (M, Fπ). We focus now on a class of proper symplectic realizations to which one
can always attach a transverse integral aﬃne structure:

Deﬁnition 7.2.1. An isotropic realization of a Poisson manifold (M, π) is a
symplectic realization q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) whose ﬁbers are connected isotropic
submanifolds of (X, ΩX).

Remark 7.2.2. Dazord and Delzant have studied in [26] the notion of a sym-
plectically complete isotropic ﬁbration of a symplectic manifold (X, ΩX ). It
is deﬁned as a ﬁbration q : X → M satisfying two properties:

(i) the ﬁbers of q are isotropic;
(ii) the symplectic orthogonal (ker dq)⊥ is an integrable distribution.

If one assumes additionally that the ﬁbers of q are connected it follows that M
carries a unique Poisson structure such that q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) is a Poisson
map, therefore making q into an isotropic realization of (M, π). Conversely, any
isotropic realization of a Poisson manifold satisﬁes Dazord-Delzant’s conditions.

However, while the two notions are equivalent, they do reﬂect two diﬀerent points
of view, depending on whether one emphasizes the Poisson manifold (M, π) or the
symplectic manifold (X, ΩX ), respectively. The second point of view makes it clear
that we are dealing with a generalization of the notion of a Lagrangian ﬁbration of
a symplectic manifold (see Section 3.1).

Generalizing from proper Lagrangian ﬁbrations, any proper isotropic realization
also has an associated lattice. The inﬁnitesimal action σ : q∗T ∗M → X(X) asso-
ciated with the Poisson map q : X → M (see Appendix A) restricts to an action
σ : ν∗(Fπ) → X(X), which integrates to a global (bundle of groups) action:

Of course, this is just a particular case of the previous discussion: the exponential
x(Fπ) → Σ(M, x)0 identiﬁes this action with the restriction of the action

map exp : ν∗
of Σ(M ) on X to the connected component of its isotropy.

Deﬁnition 7.2.3. The lattice associated to the proper isotropic realization
q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) is the lattice ΛX ⊂ ν∗(Fπ) given by:
σ(α) = id}.

ΛX,x := {α ∈ ν∗

x(Fπ) : φ1
The associated torus bundle is TX := ν∗(Fπ)/ΛX.

Lemma 7.2.4. If q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) is a proper isotropic realization, then
ΛX deﬁnes a transverse integral aﬃne structure for the symplectic foliation Fπ,
containing the monodromy group Nmon of (M, π) (see Section 3.4).

Moreover, the action (7.5) induces an action of TX on X,

m : TX ×M X → X, (λ, u) 7→ λ · u,

which is free and proper, makes q : X → M into a principal TX -bundle and the
action is presymplectic in the sense that
m∗(ΩX ) = pr∗

1(ωT ) + pr∗

2(ΩX ),

(7.6)

where ωT the presymplectic form on TX (cf. Proposition 3.2.8).

Proof. The fact that ΛX is a transverse integral aﬃne structure is proved exactly as
in the case of Lagrangian ﬁbrations (see, e.g., [26], or our proof of Theorem 3.3.1).
The fact that ΛX contains Nmon is clear because we already know that the action of
ν∗(Fπ) on X factors through the action of the identity component of Σ(M ), which
is ν∗(Fπ)/Nmon.

The action of TX on X is free since ΛX is precisely the kernel of the ν(Fπ)-
action and the properness follows from the properness of TX . To check that the
action is presymplectic, it suﬃces to observe that the action of Σ(M ) on X is
symplectic, together with the fact that the presymplectic forms on the conormal
bundle coincides with the the pull-back of the symplectic form of Σ(M ) via the
exponential map exp : ν∗(Fπ) → Σ(M ).
(cid:3)

We can now state the main result of this section:

Theorem 7.2.5. For any proper isotropic realization q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π):

(i) HolX (M, π) is an X-compatible, s-connected symplectic integration of (M, π).
(ii) For any X-compatible, s-connected symplectic integration (G, Ω) ⇒ (M, π)

there are ´etale morphisms of symplectic groupoids:

Σ(M, π)

/ G

/ HolX (M, π) ;

(iii) HolX (M, π) is a proper Lie groupoid if and only if Fπ is of proper type.
Moreover, one has a short exact sequence of Lie groupoids:

0

/ TX

/ HolX (M, π)

/ Hol(M, Fπ)

/ 0 .

For the proof of this theorem we start with an elementary but important prop-
erty of isotropic realizations, which serves as starting point for reconstructing the
holonomy groupoid of (ker dq)⊥ (hence, using (7.4, also the groupoid HolX (M, π)).

Lemma 7.2.6. For an isotropic ﬁbration q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π), the foliation
(ker dq)⊥ coincides with the pull-back via q of the symplectic foliation Fπ.

Proof. The deﬁnition of the inﬁnitesimal action σ shows that Im(σ) = (ker dq)⊥.
Now, the fact that q is a symplectic realization is equivalent to

π♯(ξ) = dq(σ(ξ)),

∀ξ ∈ T ∗M.

We deduce that, for a vector v tangent to X, one has:

dq(v) ∈ Fπ ⇐⇒ dq(v) = dq(σ(ξ)), for some ξ ∈ T ∗M

⇐⇒ v ∈ Im(σ) + (ker dq) = (ker dq)⊥ + (ker dq) = (ker dq)⊥

where for the last equality we used that the ﬁbers are isotropic.

(cid:3)

Next, we look at the interaction between TX and the holonomy of the foliation.
Using the general properties of transverse integral aﬃne structures (see Section 5.1)
and the discussion on presymplectic actions from Appendix A.5, one ﬁnds:

Lemma 7.2.7. The linear holonomy action (2.2) preserves ΛX so descends to an
action on TX : for any leafwise path γ : [0, 1] → M from x to y one obtains

holγ : TX,x → TX,y.

If Hol(M, Fπ) is endowed with the zero presymplectic form then the resulting action
m : Hol(M, Fπ) ×M TX → TX is presymplectic:

m∗(ωT ) = pr∗

2(ωT ).

(7.7)

We can now turn to the study of HolX (M, π), with the aim of proving Theorem
7.2.5. Following the general discussion in Section 7.1, our strategy will be to un-
derstand the holonomy groupoid Hol((ker dq)⊥) and then show that the morphism
HolX (M, π) ⋉ X → Hol((ker dq)⊥) is actually in isomorphism.

Lemma 7.2.6 and the fact that q has connected ﬁbers, shows that

Hol((ker dq)⊥)∼=q∗ Hol(Fπ),

where q∗ Hol(Fπ) is the pullback groupoid:

q∗ Hol(Fπ) = (X ×M Hol(M, Fπ) ×M X ⇒ X).

(7.8)

(7.9)

This groupoid consists of triples (v, γ, u) with q(v) = t(γ), s(γ) = q(u). The source
and target of the arrow (v, γ, u) are u and v, respectively, and the multiplication is
given by:

(w, γ1, v) · (v, γ2, u) = (w, γ1 · γ2, u).

Here we will momentarily not distinguish between the leafwise path γ and the
element it represents in the holonomy groupoid.

Next, we consider the projection q∗ Hol(Fπ) → M , (v, γ, u) 7→ q(u), and we
deﬁne an action of the torus bundle TX on q∗ Hol(Fπ) → M appealing to Lemma
7.2.7, by setting for each λ ∈ TX |q(x):

λ · (v, γ, u) = (holγ(λ) · v, γ, λ · u).

(7.10)

Since the action of TX on X is free and proper, it follows easily that the resulting
quotient q∗ Hol(Fπ)/TX is a Lie groupoid:

Lemma 7.2.8. If q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) is a proper isotropic realization, the
quotient

q∗ Hol(Fπ)/TX = (X ×M Hol(M, Fπ) ×M X) /TX ⇒ M

is a smooth groupoid, which is Hausdorﬀ whenever Hol(M, Fπ) is Hausdorﬀ. More-
over, q∗ Hol(Fπ)/TX is proper if Fπ is of proper type.

PMCT 2

75

Proof. It is immediate to check from the deﬁnitions that the quotient is a groupoid.
When Hol(M, Fπ) is Hausdorﬀ, then we have a free and proper action of TX on a
Hausdorﬀ manifold, hence the quotient is smooth and Hausdorﬀ. The last part on
properness also follows immediately.

The only remaining question is to show that the quotient is smooth, when
Hol(M, Fπ) is non-Hausdorﬀ. Since the quotient map can be made into a sub-
mersion in at most one way, we only have to prove the local statement, around a
neighborhood of an arrow [v0, γ0, u0] going from x0 to y0. Choosing two local sec-
tions of TX , τt and τs, deﬁned on opens U (y0) containing y0 and U (x0) containing
x0, respectively, then

TX |U(y0) ×M Hol(M, Fπ) ×M TX |U(x0) → X ×M Hol(M, Fπ) ×M X

(λ2, γ, λ1) 7→ (λ2 · τt(t(γ)), γ, λ1 · τs(s(γ)))

deﬁnes an embedding into an open invariant subspace of X ×M Hol ×M X. Finally,
the quotient of the left hand side modulo the action of TX is clearly smooth.
(cid:3)

Next, we exhibit the symplectic structure of q∗ Hol(Fπ)/TX :

Lemma 7.2.9. The 2-form eΩ := pr∗

3 ΩX on X ×M Hol(M, Fπ) ×M X,
where pri is the projection on the i-th factor, descends to a 2-form Ω on the quotient
groupoid q∗ Hol(Fπ)/TX , making it into a symplectic groupoid integrating (M, π).

1 ΩX − pr∗

1 ΩX − pr∗

to a symplectic form Ω on the quotient q∗ Hol(Fπ)/TX and that the target map

Proof. A more or less tedious computation shows that the kernel of the closed form
3 ΩX is the image of the inﬁnitesimal action induced by (7.10).

eΩ = pr∗
Also, note that pr3 : (q∗ Hol(Fπ),eΩ) → (M, π) is f-Dirac. It follows thateΩ descends
is Poisson. Since eΩ is obviously multiplicative, so is Ω, hence one obtains a sym-

t : (q∗ Hol(Fπ)/TX , Ω) → (M, π)

plectic groupoid (q∗ Hol(Fπ)/TX , Ω) integrating (M, π).

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 7.2.5. We claim that HolX (M, π) is a smooth quotient of Σ(M, π),
i.e., that it admits a smooth structure (necessarily unique) such that the canonical
projection is a submersion. As ﬁrst step we construct an isomorphism of groupoids

Φ : HolX (M, π) ∼= q∗ Hol(Fπ)/TX

(7.11)

as follows: for an element [a]h ∈ HolX (M, π) represented by a cotangent path whose
base path γa starts at x ∈ M , we choose any u ∈ q−1(x) and we set

Φ([a]h) := [[a] · u, γa, u] ∈ HolX (M, π),

where we use the action of [a] ∈ Σ(M, π) on X (see (7.2)) and we omit writing [γa]h
for the middle element. This is independent of the choice of u.

The injectivity of Φ is clear: if γa1 and γa2 have the same holonomy with respect
to Fπ, Lemma 7.2.6 shows that any lifts tangent to (ker dq)⊥ and starting at the
a2, have the same holonomy with respect to (ker dq)⊥.
For the surjectivity of Φ, given any [v, γ, u], one chooses a cotangent path a with
[γa]h = γ. Since [a]·u and v are in the same ﬁber of q, we can write [v] = [α]·([a] · u)
for some α ∈ ν∗(Fπ), so that:

76

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

To check that HolX (M, π) is a smooth quotient of Σ(M, π), we still have to check
that the composition of the map Φ with the projection Σ(M, π) → HolX (M, π) is
a submersion. For that it suﬃces to prove the same property for its pull-back to
X via q. On the pull-back, one has the identiﬁcation (7.3) with the monodromy
groupoid of (ker dq)⊥, the interpretation of (7.9) as the holonomy groupoid of the
same foliation, and the map is just the canonical projection between the two.

For the proof of Theorem 7.2.5 (ii), let G be any other X-compatible, s-connected,
symplectic integration of (M, π). The groupoid q∗G is an s-connected integration of
the foliation (ker dq)⊥. Since q∗ Hol(M, Fπ) ≃∼= ((ker dq)⊥), and Mon((ker dq)⊥) ∼=
q∗Σ(M, π), there are morphisms q∗Σ(M, π) → q∗G → q∗ Hol(M, Fπ) so that the
following is a commutative diagram of surjective groupoid maps:

HolX (M, π)

The existence of the dotted arrow follows by surjectivity, so this proves (ii).

Finally, part (iii) of the theorem follows from the description of HolX (M, π) as
(cid:3)

a quotient of q∗ Hol(M, Fπ).

We now look at some consequences of Theorem 7.2.5. We concentrate on Poisson
manifolds (M, π) for which the symplectic foliation Fπ is of proper type, a condition
that is necessary for (M, π) to be of proper type. First of all we have:

Corollary 7.2.10. Let (M, π) be a Poisson manifold with Fπ of proper type. If
q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) is a proper isotropic realization then HolX (M, π) is an s-
connected proper symplectic groupoid. Moreover:

(i) the orbifold structure induced on B = M/Fπ is a classical orbifold structure;
(ii) the transverse integral aﬃne structure associated to the proper isotropic real-
ization q coincides with the one induced by the proper integration HolX (M, π).

In particular:

Corollary 7.2.11. Let (M, π) be a Poisson manifold with Fπ of proper type. If
(M, π) admits a proper symplectic realization, then (M, π) is of proper type.

One should be aware however that the properness of (M, π) does not imply the
existence of proper symplectic realizations. As we shall explain in the ﬁnal sections
of the paper, there is one more obstruction to the existence of proper symplectic
realizations: the Lagrangian Dixmier-Douady class.

The previous corollary brings us to yet another aspect: after eventually passing
to a cover, proper symplectic realizations can be made simple in the sense of the
following:

Deﬁnition 7.2.12. A simple isotropic realization is an isotropic realization
q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) for which there exists an X-compatible symplectic integration
(G, Ω) ⇒ (M, π) whose action on X is free.

Using Theorem 7.2.5 and the discussion from Appendix A, we deduce the fol-

lowing equivalent characterizations:

Proposition 7.2.13. Let q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) be a proper isotropic realization
and assume that the symplectic foliation Fπ is of proper type. Then the following

(a) the symplectic foliation Fπ is simple;
(b) q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) is a simple isotropic realization;
(c) there exists an X-compatible, s-connected, proper integration (G, Ω) ⇒ (M, π)

that acts freely on X;

(d) (X, ΩX ) is a free Hamiltonian TΛ-space for an integral aﬃne manifold (B, Λ)

with reduced space (M, π) ∼= (Xred, πred) (see Corollary A.4.2).

Of course, under any of the equivalent conditions of the proposition, one has that
B = M/Fπ, Λ the integral aﬃne structure on B induced by ΛX and G is the gauge
groupoid G ∼= X ⋆

X associated to the principal TX -space X (Appendix A.4).

Proof. The fact that the holonomy of the symplectic foliation Fπ is an obstruction
to the existence of simple isotropic realizations of (M, π) follows from (7.8), the
minimality property of holonomy groupoids (Theorem 2.1.2) and the fact that for
an X-compatible integration G ⋉ X is a foliation groupoid integrating (ker dq)⊥.
The rest of the statement should be clear.
(cid:3)

In order to show that eventually passing to a cover, proper symplectic realizations
can be made simple, we need to appeal to the main result of Appendix B. This
result applied to the proper foliation (M, Fπ), together with the transversal integral
aﬃne structure ΛX , yields the linear holonomy cover (M lin, F lin
π ) with a smooth
leaf space Blin = M lin/F lin
π - an integral aﬃne manifold carrying an action of the
linear holonomy group Γlin by integral aﬃne transformations, with Blin/Γlin = B.
The conclusion is that when Fπ is of proper type, any proper isotropic realization
is obtained as quotient of a simple one:

Corollary 7.2.14. Let (M, π) be a Poisson manifold with Fπ of proper type. If
q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) is a proper isotropic realization then X lin := X ×M M lin
yields a Γlin-equivariant proper isotropic realization

which is simple.

This is summarized in the following diagram:

7.3. Isotropic realizations and Morita equivalence. The symplectic groupoids
arising from proper isotropic realizations form a rather special class among all
proper symplectic groupoids. A ﬁrst illustration is the following result, where we
use the presymplectic version of Morita equivalence (see Appendix A):

Proposition 7.3.1. If q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) is a proper isotropic realization then
X ×M Hol(M, Fπ), endowed with the pull-back of ΩX by the ﬁrst projection, deﬁnes
a presymplectic Morita equivalence between the symplectic groupoid HolX (M, π) and
the presymplectic groupoid integrating the Dirac structure LFπ :

Proof. For the groupoid on the right hand side we use the description given by
(3.4), while for the groupoid HolX (M, π) we use (7.11). The two left and right
actions are deﬁned by

[v, γ0, u] · (u, γ1) = (v, γ0 · γ1),

(u, γ1) · (λ, γ2) = (holγ1 (λ)u, γ1 · γ2).

respectively. The actions obviously commute and it is straightforward to check that
they are principal, so they deﬁne a Morita equivalence.

We are left with proving that the actions are presymplectic. We will use the
abbreviated notation Hol = Hol(M, Fπ). For the right action, we have to check an
equality of forms on the ﬁber product

X ×M Hol ×M TX ×M Hol = {((u, γ1), (λ, γ2)) : q(u) = t(γ1), s(γ1) = t(γ2) = p(λ)}.
We denote by Hol(2) the space of pairs of composable arrows in Hol and by letting
η = holγ1 (λ) we reparametrize this ﬁber product space as

X ×M TX ×M Hol(2) = {(u, η, γ1, γ2) : q(u) = p(η) = t(γ1)}.

The two projections and the multiplication corresponding to the right action on
the bibundle, on this new space become:

• pr1 : X ×M TX ×M Hol(2) → X ×M Hol, (u, η, γ1, γ2) 7→ (u, γ1). We need

to consider the pull-back by this map of the form pr∗

X ΩX .

• m : X ×M TX ×M Hol(2) → X ×M Hol, (u, η, γ1, γ2) 7→ (η · u, γ1 · γ2). We

need to consider the pull-back by this map of the form pr∗

X ΩX .

• pr2 : X ×M TX ×M Hol(2) → TX ⋊⋉ Hol, (u, η, γ1, γ2) 7→ (hol−1

γ1 (η), γ2).
We need to consider the pull-back by this map of the form pr∗
TX ωT . How-
ever, due to (7.7), the same result is obtained if one pulls-back ωT via
(u, η, γ1, γ2) 7→ η.

Combining these three terms, we ﬁnd that the equation
2 pr∗

X ΩX + pr∗
reduces to (7.6), so the right action is presymplectic.

X ΩX = pr∗

m∗ pr∗

1 pr∗

TX ωT

For the left action one needs to check that:

m∗ pr∗

X ΩX = pr∗

1 Ω + pr∗

2 pr∗

X ΩX .

If one pulls back both sides of this equation along the submersion:

X ×M Hol ×M X ×M X → HolX ×M (X ×M Hol)

(v, γ0, u, γ1) 7→ ([v, γ0, u], (u, γ1))

one obtains an obvious identity, so the the left action is presymplectic.

(cid:3)

One can pass from presymplectic to symplectic Morita equivalences by restricting

to complete transversals to the symplectic foliation. We obtain:

Corollary 7.3.2. If q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) is a proper isotropic realization, for
each choice of a complete transversal T ⊂ M to Fπ there is a symplectic Morita
equivalence:

The previous two results show that the groupoids associated with proper isotropic
realizations are very special: they are Morita equivalent to torus bundles over the
leaf space. Moreover, their symplectic Morita equivalence class does not depend on
X but only on the transverse integral aﬃne structure it deﬁnes on (M, Fπ).

When the foliation Fπ is proper we can do better and pass to torus bundle over
classical orbifolds (see Corollary 7.2.10). Here, as for Corollary 7.2.14, we appeal
again to Appendix B; the Morita point of view leads to an improvement of the
corollary. More precisely, if we consider the linear holonomy cover Blin, together
with the action of the linear holonomy group Γlin, we see that one has not only
the symplectic torus bundle TBlin corresponding to the integral aﬃne structure, but
also the semi-direct groupoid (itself a symplectic groupoid!)

TBlin ⋊⋉ Γlin ⇒ Blin.

Corollary 7.3.3. If Fπ is of proper type then, for any proper isotropic realization
q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π), the symplectic holonomy groupoid HolX (M, π) is Morita
equivalent to the symplectic groupoid TBlin ⋊⋉ Γlin ⇒ Blin associated with the linear
holonomy cover of the classical orbifold B = M/Fπ. In particular, there is a 1-1
correspondence:



Hamiltonian

HolX (M, π)-spaces

1−1←→

Γlin-equivariant

Hamiltonian TBlin-spaces

The advantage of passing to Blin instead of restricting to transversals is that the
construction is choice-free and the base Blin remains connected if M is connected.

7.4. Isotropic realizations and E-integrations. If we start from a proper isotropic
realization q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π), the corresponding holonomy groupoid ﬁts into a
short exact sequence (see Theorem 7.2.5):

0

/ TX

/ HolX (M, π)

/ Hol(M, Fπ)

/ 0 .

One the other hand, if we consider an s-connected, proper symplectic integration
(G, Ω) ⇒ (M, π) then we have the short exact sequence:

0

/ T (G)

/ G

/ B(G)

/ 0 ,

where T (G) = ν∗(Fπ)/Λ and B(G) ⇒ M is a proper foliation groupoid integrating
Fπ. In general, the groupoid B(G) will be a larger integration than Hol(M, Fπ).

This shows that it is not possible to obtain every s-connected, proper symplectic
integration (G, Ω) ⇒ (M, π) as the holonomy groupoid relative to an isotropic
realization of (M, π). However, one can extend the construction of HolX (M, π),
replacing Hol(M, π) by any foliation groupoid integrating Fπ, even non s-connected
integrations, if we adopt the identiﬁcation (7.9) as deﬁnition of HolX (M, π):

Deﬁnition 7.4.1. For any proper isotropic realization q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) and
any integration E ⇒ M of (M, Fπ) the E-integration of (M, π) relative to X is

EX (M, π) := (X ×M E ×M X) /TX ⇒ M

with the symplectic structure induced from the 2-form eΩ := pr∗

This deﬁnition recovers HolX (M, π) when E = Hol(M, Fπ). However, one should
be aware that when E = Mon(M, Fπ) the groupoid EX (M, π) and the Weinstein
groupoid Σ(M, π), in general, do not coincide, since q∗ Mon(M, Fπ) may be very
diﬀerent from Mon(q∗Fπ) = Mon((ker dq)⊥).

1 ΩX − pr∗

3 ΩX .

Remark 7.4.2. When the foliation groupoid E is s-connected we can still deﬁne
the E-integration of (M, π) relative to X geometrically, as in Deﬁnition 7.1.4: the
pullback groupoid q∗E is also an s-connected integration of (ker dq)⊥, and one can
deﬁne cotangent E-equivalent paths, in a manner analogous to the way we deﬁned
cotangent holonomic paths, by requiring their horizontal lifts to induce the same
element in the pull-back q∗E. However, this geometric deﬁnition fails in general,
and later we do have to deal with non s-connected foliation groupoids.

Exactly the same arguments as before imply the following more general version

of Theorem 7.2.5:

Theorem 7.4.3. For any proper isotropic realization q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) and
any foliation groupoid E integrating (M, Fπ):

(i) EX (M, π) is an an X-compatible symplectic integration of (M, π).
(ii) EX (M, π) is an s-connected, proper Lie groupoid iﬀ E is s-connected and

proper.

Moreover, one has a short exact sequence of Lie groupoids:

0

/ TX

/ EX (M, π)

/ E

/ 0 .

When Fπ is proper we still ﬁnd:

• the transverse integral aﬃne structure deﬁned by EX (M, π) coincides with

the lattice ΛX deﬁned by the proper isotropic realization.

• the associated orbifold structure on B = M/Fπ is the one induced by E.

Also, similar to Proposition 7.3.1, TX ⋊⋉ E ⇒ M is a presympectic groupoid inte-
grating the Dirac structure LFπ associated with the foliation Fπ, and one obtains:

Proposition 7.4.4. If q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) is a proper isotropic realization
and E is a foliation groupoid integrating (M, Fπ), there is a presymplectic Morita
equivalence:

By restricting to complete transversals T ⊂ M to Fπ, one can obtain symplectic

Morita equivalences, leading to the analogue of Corollary 7.3.2.

7.5. The Dazord-Delzant class. Given a regular Poisson manifold (M, π), we
have seen that any proper isotropic realization q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) deﬁnes a
transverse integral aﬃne structure ΛX on (M, Fπ). We now address the converse
problem. Namely, given:

• (M, π) a Poisson manifold;
• Λ ⊂ ν∗(Fπ) a transverse integral aﬃne structure;

is there a proper isotropic realization q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) deﬁning Λ? This leads
to a cohomology class, which is essentially due to Dazord and Delzant [26], and
which we will call the Dazord-Delzant class associated to the data (M, π, Λ).

In order to describe this class, we will have to deal with sheaf cohomology. For a
bundle E → M we will denote by E the associated sheaf of sections. For example,
T denotes the sheaf of section of the torus bundle T → M and we will also denote
by T cl the sheaf of closed sections, so for an open set V ⊂ M we have:

T cl(U ) = {α ∈ T (U ) : α∗ωcan = dα = 0}.

Let us denote by (Ω•(M, Fπ), d) the complex of forms whose pullback to the
leaves of Fπ vanish. We have the short exact of sequence of sheaves (Poincar´e
Lemma):

0

/ Ω•

cl(M, Fπ)

/ Ω•(M, Fπ)

d

/ Ω•+1

cl

(M, Fπ)

/ 0

(7.13)

where Ω•

cl(M, Fπ) denotes the sheaf of closed forms. Notice that:

Ω1(M, Fπ) = ν∗(Fπ),

cl(M, Fπ) as a locally constant subsheaf. If T := ν∗(Fπ)/Λ,

and we can view Λ ⊂ Ω1
this leads to an identiﬁcation of quotient sheaves:
T cl = Ω1

T = Ω1(M, Fπ)/Λ,

cl(M, Fπ)/Λ,

and to the short exact sequence of sheaves:

0

/ T cl

d

/ T

/ Ω2

cl(M, Fπ)

/ 0

We are interested in the following piece of the corresponding long exact sequence
in sheaf cohomology:

/ H 1(M, T )

/ H 1(M, Ω2

cl(M, Fπ))

δ

/ H 2(M, T cl)

(7.14)

Now observe that associated to the leafwise symplectic form ωFπ there is a class
which is the obstruction to extend ωFπ to a closed two 2-form on M : if {Ua}a∈A
is a good cover of M then we can ﬁnd closed 2-forms ωa ∈ Ω2(Ua) which locally
extend ωFπ and on Uab = Ua ∩ Ub their diﬀerence is closed and vanishes on the
symplectic leaves, so deﬁnes a 2-cycle ωab := ωa − ωb ∈ Ω2
cl(Uab, Fπ). Hence, we
can set

ξ(M, π) := [ωij ] ∈ H 1(M, Ω2

cl(M, Fπ)).

Remark 7.5.1. Since Ω•(M, Fπ) is a ﬁne sheaf, the sequence (7.13) gives:

H 1(M, Ω2

cl(M, Fπ)) ≃

H 0(M, Ω3
dH 0(M, Ω2

cl(M, Fπ))
cl(M, Fπ))

= H 3(M, Fπ).

Under this isomorphism, the class ξ(M, π) corresponds to the class [deω] where
eω ∈ Ω2(M ) is any 2-form extending the leafwise symplectic form ωFπ .

Deﬁnition 7.5.2. If (M, π) is a regular Poisson structure and Λ ⊂ ν∗(Fπ) is a
transverse integral aﬃne structure, the Dazord-Delzant class c2(M, π, Λ) is the
image of ξ(M, π) under the connecting homomorphism (7.14):
c2(M, π, Λ) := δ(ξ(M, π)) ∈ H 2(M, T cl),

Notice that an explicit 2-cocycle representing the obstruction class can be ob-
tained by considering a good cover {Ua} of M and local extensions ωa ∈ Ω2(Ua) of
the leafwise symplectic form ωFπ , so that the diﬀerence ωab = ωa − ωb is exact:

ωab = dαab,

(αab ∈ Ω1(Uab, Fπ)).

Then αab + αbc + αca is a closed 1-form in Uabc := Ua ∩ Ub ∩ Uc vanishing on the
leaves, and its projection gives a 2-cocycle representing c2(M, π, Λ):

cabc = [αab + αbc + αca] ∈ Ω1

cl(Uabc, Fπ)/Λ.

The following result is essentially due to Dazord and Delzant:

Theorem 7.5.3 ([26]). The class c2(M, π, Λ) vanishes if and only if Λ is deﬁned
by a proper isotropic realization q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π).

The proof of this result can be split into two steps:
(i) c2(M, π, Λ) = 0 if and only if there is a class c1 ∈ H 1(M, T ) which is mapped

to ξ(M, π) in the long exact sequence (7.14);

(ii) Given any class c1 ∈ H 1(M, T ) there is a principal T -bundle q : X → M
whose Chern class is c1. This bundle has a symplectic structure ΩX making
q into a symplectic complete isotropic ﬁbration inducing π on M if and only
if c1 is mapped to ξ(M, π) in the long exact sequence (7.14).

We refer to [26] for the details.

To our knowledge, it is an open problem to give an example of a Poisson manifold
(M, π) with Dazord-Delzant class c2(M, π, Λ) 6= 0, where Λ is a lattice deﬁned by
some proper integration (G, Ω) ⇒ (M, π).

Remark 7.5.4 (The Dirac setting). The results on proper isotropic realizations
extend to twisted Dirac structures with the appropriate modiﬁcations. Now, the
central notion is that of a presymplectic realization (see [11]):

q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, L, φ),

where ω is a 2-form such that dΩX + q∗φ = 0, q is a f-Dirac map, and one requires
the non-degeneracy condition:

Ker(ΩX ) ∩ Ker(dq) = {0}.

One deﬁnes HolX (M, L), the holonomy groupoid relative to the presymplectic re-
alization q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, L, φ), as the quotient of cotangent paths modulo
cotangent holonomy rel X as in Deﬁnition 7.1.4. Then all fundamental proper-
ties of HolX (M, π) still hold in the presymplectic setting, namely Theorem 7.2.5,
Proposition 7.2.13 and Corollary 7.3.3. In the proofs one must use the (twisted)
presymplectic version of Hamiltonian G-spaces (see Appendix A).

The Dazord-Delzant theory also extends in a more or less straightforward way

to twisted Dirac structures (see [57] for the case of twisted Poisson structures).

8. Symplectic gerbes over manifolds

In the previous sections we have seen that Poisson manifolds of proper type
come with a rich transverse geometry. In particular, the leaf space is an integral
aﬃne orbifold. We now ﬁx an integral aﬃne orbifold (B, Λ) and we investigate
the freedom one has in building Poisson manifolds of proper type with leaf space
(B, Λ). This problem is really about constructing (symplectic) groupoid extensions
with kernel the torus bundle T associated to Λ, and hence resembles the standard
theory of S1-gerbes ([6, 45, 51, 55, 62]).

Recall that an S1-gerbe is a higher version of the notion of principal S1-bundle
over B. While principal S1-bundles are classiﬁed by their Chern class c1 ∈ H 2(B, Z),
S1-gerbes are classiﬁed by a similar class c2 ∈ H 3(B, Z), called the Dixmier-Douady
class. We will introduce a symplectic variant of the theory, consisting of symplectic
TΛ-gerbes over B and we will show that they are classiﬁed by their Lagrangian
Dixmier-Douady class living in H 2(B, T Lagr).

To achieve this, we will need the following variations of the standard theory of

S1-gerbes:

v1: Replace S1 by general torus bundles T : this is straightforward, but
note that, while S1-gerbes arise as higher versions of principal S1-bundles,
in the process of passing from S1 to torus bundles, principal S1-bundles will
be replaced by T -torsors, a special class of principal T -bundles. Therefore,
T -gerbes arise as higher versions of T -torsors;

v2: A symplectic version of the theory: this is the main novelty of our
story. Remarkably, the lower version of the theory, the symplectic story, i.e.
symplectic T -torsors, as well as its relevance to Lagrangian ﬁbrations, has
already appeared in [60];

v3: Gerbes over orbifolds: although a large part of our discussion will be
carried out in the case where B is a smooth manifold, in general our leaf
spaces B are orbifolds. The passage from manifolds to orbifolds will be
based again on Haeﬂiger’s philosophy (Remark 2.3.3). Note that S1-gerbes
over orbifolds have already been considered- see e.g. [45].

Some of the generalizations of S1-gerbes that we will consider could, in principle,
be obtained by making use of the general theory of gerbes with a given “band” over
general “sites” [7, 34, 43]. However, since all our bands will be abelian, and the
most general sites we we need are the ones associated to orbifolds, we do not have
to appeal to the general theory. And, more importantly, our symplectic gerbes can
always be represented by extensions of Lie groupoids (as in, e.g., [55, 45, 6, 62]).

In this Section we take care of symplectic gerbes over smooth manifolds, leaving
the orbifold case for the next section. Regarding PMCTs, the outcome can be
stated in a simpliﬁed form as follows:

Theorem 8.0.5. Assume that (M, π) is a Poisson manifold of proper type whose
foliation Fπ has 1-connected leaves. Then each proper integration (G, Ω) ⇒ (M, π)
gives rise to a symplectic gerbe over B = (M/Fπ, ΛG), which is classiﬁed by a class

c2(G, Ω) ∈ H 2(B, T Lagr).

Moreover, its pull-back via the projection p : M → B is precisely the Dazord-Delzant
class c2(M, π, ΛG) (Deﬁnition 7.5.2). Furthermore, c2(G, Ω) vanishes iﬀ G is the
gauge groupoid of a free Hamiltonian T -space q : (X, ΩX ) → B (Appendix A.4).

MARIUS CRAINIC, RUI LOJA FERNANDES, AND DAVID MART´INEZ TORRES

8.1. Symplectic torsors. Since S1-gerbes are higher versions of principal S1-
bundles, in order to get ready to deal with symplectic gerbes, we ﬁrst discuss how
to implement the variations that we mentioned in the case of principal S1-bundles.
Here we concentrate on variations v1 and v2. The formalism necessary for passing
to orbifolds will be discussed in the next section.

8.1.1. From S1 to general torus bundles. We would like to replace S1 by a general
torus bundle T → B and principal S1-bundles by “principal T -bundles”. Some
care is needed, since we will not be dealing with general principal T -bundles.

Recall that a (right) principal H-bundle over M , for any Lie groupoid H ⇒ N
over some other manifold N , consists of a bundle P with two maps: the bundle
projection p : P → M , as well as a map q : P → N along which H acts on P :

&◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

H

N

M

When M = N = B and G = T is a torus bundle over B, principal T -bundles over
B still come with two maps, p and q, which need not coincide. We will be interested
in principal T -bundles over B, which in addition satisfy p = q. These will be called
T -torsors. To distinguish them from other types of (groupoid) principal bundles,
we will denote them by the letter X.

Hence a T -torsor over B is a manifold X endowed with a (right) action of T along

a submersion pX : X → B, along which T acts ﬁberwise, freely, and transitively:

X

pX

B

T

~⑦⑦⑦⑦⑦⑦⑦⑦

The fusion product of two T -torsors X1 and X2 is the new T -torsor

X1 ⋆ X2 := (X1 ×B X2)/T ,

(8.1)

where T acts on the ﬁbered product by (u1, u2) · λ = (u1 · λ, u2 · λ), and where the
action of T on X1 ⋆ X2 is induced by the action on the second factor. Modulo the
obvious notion of isomorphism, one obtains an abelian group TorB(T ).

Remark 8.1.1 (B-ﬁbered objects). A very useful interpretation to keep in mind
of the condition p = q, distinguishing T -torsors as a particular class of principal
T -bundle, is the following. The base B is ﬁxed from the start and all the objects
that one considers are “ﬁbered” over B or “parametrized” by B, i.e. come with a
submersion onto B. One should refer to them as pairs (N, pN ) with pN : N → B,
but we will simply say that N is B-ﬁbered without further mentioning pN . They
form a category ManB.

The objects that we consider are B-ﬁbered versions of standard objects, which
maybe recovered by letting B be a point. For instance, a torus bundle T → B
is just a compact, connected, abelian group object in ManB. More generally, a
Lie groupoid ﬁbered over B, i.e. a Lie groupoid in ManB, is just a Lie groupoid
H ⇒ N together with a submersion pN : N → B such that pN ◦ s = pN ◦ t. These
should be thought of as families of groupoids parametrized by b ∈ B, namely the
restrictions of H to the ﬁbers p−1
N (b). One also has a B-ﬁbered version of principal

When M = N = B, this precisely means that p = q. Hence, T -torsors are the same
thing as B-ﬁbered principal T -bundles over B.

If H ⇒ N is a Lie groupoid we denote by BunH(M ) the set of equivalence
classes of principal H-bundles over M . The description of principal bundles based
on transition functions, yields an isomorphism:

BunH(M ) ∼= ˇH 1(M, H),

(8.2)
where ˇH 1(M, H) denotes Haeﬂiger’s ﬁrst ˇCech cohomology with values in the
groupoid H [38, 40]: the ˇCech cocycles are families g = {Vi, gij}, where {Vi}i∈I is
an open cover of M and

gij : Vij → G,

gij(x) · gjk(x) = gik(x), ∀x ∈ Vijk.

(8.3)

Two such cocycles g and h are cohomologous if (after eventually passing to a re-
ﬁnement) there exist λi : Vi → H such that:

hij (x) = λi(x) · gij (x) · λj (x)−1, ∀x ∈ Vij .

One has a completely similar B-ﬁbered version of the previous discussion, ob-
tained by requiring that all the maps involved, including isomorphisms of principal
bundles, ˇCech cocycles {gij}, etc., commute with the projections into B. One
obtains a B-ﬁbered version of (8.2):

BunH,B(M ) ∼= ˇH 1

B(M, H).

(8.4)

In the case we are interested in, when M = N = B and G = T , notice that

ˇH 1

B(B, T ) = H 1(B, T ),

the cohomology with coeﬃcients in the sheaf T of sections of T .

One can use the exponential sequence of T to pass to the associated lattice Λ:

1

/ Λ

/ t

exp

/ T

/ 1 ,

Then (8.4) becomes the Chern-class isomorphism

c1 : TorB(T ) ∼ /

/ H 1(B, T ) ∼= H 2(B, Λ)

(8.5)

(8.6)

associating to a T -torsor its Chern class. Concretely, given a T -torsor p : X → B,
any open cover {Vi} of B with local sections si : Vi → X, yields on overlaps

si(x) = sj(x)λij (x),

(8.7)
where the {λij } is a ˇCech 1-cocycle representing the Chern class of X. Similarly, the
construction of the real representatives of the Chern class of principal S1-bundles
via connections extends without any problem to the setting of T -torsors.

8.1.2. A symplectic version of the theory: There is very little left to be to be done
to obtain the symplectic torsors:

• restrict to symplectic torus bundles (T , ωT ) → B (see Section 3.1), which
are determined by integral aﬃne structures Λ on B (cf. Proposition 3.1.6);
• consider T -torsors X endowed with a symplectic form ΩX and require that

the action of T to be symplectic in the sense of Appendix A.

The resulting objects (X, ΩX ) are called symplectic (T , ωT )-torsors. Note that
for two such (X1, Ω1) and (X2, Ω2), their composition (8.1) is again symplectic: the
form pr∗
2 Ω2 on X1 ×B X2 descends to a symplectic form on X1 ⋆ X2. We
denote by TorB(T , ωT ) the resulting group of symplectic torsors.

1 Ω1 − pr∗

Proposition 3.1.7, in this language, says that Lagrangian ﬁbrations are the same

thing as symplectic torsors:

Proposition 8.1.2. For any symplectic T -torsor the projection into B is a La-
grangian ﬁbration. Conversely, any Lagrangian ﬁbration over B is a symplectic
TΛ-torsor, where Λ is the integral aﬃne structure induced by the ﬁbration.

The construction of the Chern class class has a natural symplectic version, that
dates back to Duistermaat’s work on global action-angle coordinates [28]. This was
further clariﬁed and generalized by Delzant and Dazord [26] and Zung [67], and
rephrased in the language of symplectic torsors by Sjamaar [60]. The relevant sheaf
is no longer T , but rather the subsheaf T Lagr of local Lagrangian sections:

T Lagr(U ) = {α ∈ T (U ) : α∗ωcan = dα = 0}.

The Lagrangian Chern class c1(X, ΩX ) ∈ H 1(B, T Lagr) of a symplectic T -torsor
X is represented by a ˇCech-cocycle {λij }, constructed as before (see (8.7)), but
using now local Lagrangian sections si : Vi → X.

To realize the Lagrangian Chern class as a degree two cohomology class, one
needs the symplectic analogue of the exact sequence (8.5). For that one considers

OΛ ⊂ OAﬀ ⊂ O,

where O is the sheaf of smooth functions on B, OAﬀ is the subsheaf of aﬃne

functions (i.e. of type x 7→ r +Pi cixi in integral aﬃne charts), and OΛ is the

subsheaf of integral aﬃne functions (obtained by requiring ci ∈ Z in the previous
expressions). The DeRham diﬀerential gives the short exact sequence of sheaves:

1

/ OΛ

/ O d

/ T Lagr

/ 1 ,

and this leads to the Chern class map for symplectic torsors (cf. (8.6)):

c1 : TorB(T , ωT ) ∼ /

/ H 1(B, T Lagr) ∼= H 2(B, OΛ) .

Finally, the forgetful map from TorB(T , ωT ) to TorB(T ) corresponds to the map

H 2(B, OΛ) → H 2(B, Λ)

induced by the DeRham diﬀerential d : OΛ → Λ, which interpreted as a sheaf
morphism gives rise to the short exact sequence:

1

/ R

/ OΛ

Corollary 8.1.3. Let T be a torus bundle over a manifold B. If B is contractible,
then any T -torsor is trivial (or, equivalently, admits a global section). The same
holds for symplectic T -torsors (i.e, they admit Lagrangian sections over contractible
open sets).

Remark 8.1.4. In the construction of the Chern class of a principal S1-bundle via
connections, one passes from integral to real coeﬃcients. Similarly, in our case, we
have to pass from OΛ to OAﬀ or, equivalently, from TLagr ∼= O/OΛ to O/OAﬀ . In
other words, to ﬁnd a representative of the Chern classes in terms of diﬀerential
forms, we are interested in the image of c1(X, ΩX ) under the map:

H 1(B, T Lagr) → H 1(B, O/OΛ) ∼= H 2(B, OAﬀ ).

(8.9)

To work with these groups, it is useful to use the following ﬁne resolution:

O/OAﬀ

/ Ω1

∂(B, T ∗B)

dΛ /

/ Ω2

∂(B, T ∗B)

dΛ /

/ . . .

∂(B, T ∗B) is the kernel of the antisymmetrization map ∂ : Ωk(B, T ∗B) →
where Ωk
Ωk+1(B), and where dΛ is the covariant derivative induced by the ﬂat connection
∂(B, T ∗B), dΛ). Now, given a sym-
associated to Λ. Hence, H 2(B, OAﬀ ) = H 2(Ω•
plectic T -torsor (X, ΩX ), one chooses a Lagrangian connection

θ ∈ Ω1(X, t)

(i.e. the horizontal spaces that it deﬁnes are Lagrangian) and one observes that its
curvature

kθ ∈ Ω2(X, t)Λ−bas = Ω2(B, T ∗B)

actually lives in Ω2
the class induced by c1(X, ΩX ) under (8.9).

∂(B, T ∗B). The resulting class [kθ] ∈ H 2(B, OAﬀ ) is precisely

8.2. Gerbes and their Dixmier-Douady class. We are now ready to move to
gerbes. Our exposition will be self-contained, overviewing the standard theory of
S1-gerbes and explaining at the same time how to take care of v1, replacing S1 by
a general torus bundle. Throughout this section we ﬁx the base manifold B and all
the objects that we will consider will be ﬁbered over B (see Remark 8.1.1).

8.2.1. Deﬁnition of a T -gerbe. Among the various approaches to gerbes, the most
relevant one for us is via extensions of groupoids [6, 45, 55, 62]: an S1-gerbe over
B is, up to Morita equivalence, an S1-extension of B, where B is interpreted as
a the identitiy groupoid. The groupoids that are Morita equivalent to B are the
groupoids M ×B M associated to submersions pM : M → B, and this leads one to
consider central S1-extension of groupoids over M :

1

/ S1
M

/ G

/ M ×B M

/ 1 ,

where S1
M = M × S1 is the trivial S1-bundle over M . There is an appropriate notion
of Morita equivalence between two such extensions (see below) and the resulting
equivalence classes are called S1-gerbes over B.

Next we replace the trivial circle bundle S1

B = B × S1 by a general bundle of tori

T → B. Therefore, we consider central groupoid extensions of type

1

/ TM

/ G

/ M ×B M

/ 1 ,

where TM = p∗

M T . Here, by central we mean that:

for any arrow g : x → y of G and λ ∈ Tb, with b = pM (x) = pM (y), and where we
use (TM )x = Tb = (TM )y.

Example 8.2.1. Recall that any (right) principal T bundle over M :

P (see Appendix A). When P is B-ﬁbered, i.e
gives rise to the gauge groupoid P ⋆
when pM ◦p = pP = q, it follows that the gauge groupoid deﬁnes a central extension
as above. Such gauge extensions will soon be considered “trivial”.

T

All the groupoids appearing in the extension (8.10) are ﬁbered over B, and this
is relevant for the right notion of equivalence. Two such extensions, associated with
projections pi : Mi → B and groupoids Gi ⇒ Mi, i = 1, 2, are said to be Morita
equivalent extensions if there exists a Morita (G1, G2)-bibundle P , in the sense
of Section 2.3, such that:

(i) P is a B-ﬁbered Morita equivalence;
(ii) P is central, i.e. the actions of TMi on P inherited from the Gi-actions coincide:

λ · u = u · λ for all u ∈ P , λ ∈ Tb, with b = p1(q1(u)) = p2(q2(u)).

The ﬁrst condition says that the map induced by P between the Gi-orbit spaces, i.e.
B, is the identity. Or, with the notations from Section 2.3, that p1 ◦ q1 = p2 ◦ q2.
Moreover, this condition is used to make sense of the second condition. With these:

Deﬁnition 8.2.2. Given a torus bundle T over a manifold B, a T -gerbe over B
is a Morita equivalence class of extensions of type (8.10).

fusion product. The set of T -gerbes over B has an
8.2.2. The group of gerbes:
abelian group structure.
It is based on the notion of fusion product of two
extensions G1 and G2 of type (8.10), which is the extension associated with the
submersion p12 : M12 = M1 ×B M2 → B:

1

/ TM12

/ G1 ⋆ G2

/ M12 ×B M12

/ 1 ,

where the groupoid G1 ⋆ G2 ⇒ M12 has space of arrows:

G1 ⋆ G2 := (G1 ×B G2)/T .

Here, the action of λ ∈ Tb on a pair (g1, g2) of arrows in the orbits of G1 and G2
corresponding to b ∈ B, is given by (g1, g2) · λ = (g1 · λ, λ · g2).

The trivial T -gerbe is the one represented by the trivial extension of the iden-

tity groupoid B ⇒ B (hence M = B):

1

/ T

/ T

/ B

/ 1 .

(8.11)

One checks easily that there are canonical isomorphisms of extensions:

G ⋆ T ∼= T ⋆ G ∼= G,

G1 ⋆ G2 ∼= G2 ⋆ G1,

(G1 ⋆ G2) ⋆ G3 ∼= G1 ⋆ (G2 ⋆ G3).

The inverse T -gerbe of the gerbe deﬁned by an extension (8.10) is represented

by the opposite extension:

where Gopp is G with the opposite multiplication and the source/target inter-
changed. This is still a T -gerbe because on T the multiplication is unchanged.
Note that the inversion gives an isomorphism G ∼= Gopp of groupoids but not one
of extensions since it does not induce the identity on T ! The fact that G ⋆ Gopp
represents the trivial gerbe follows from the straightforward Morita equivalence:

It is useful to be able to recognize more directly when an extension (8.10) rep-
resents the trivial gerbe. That means that there exists a Morita bibundle P imple-
menting a Morita equivalence with (8.11):

Since P is central, the structure of (right) principal T -bundle on P is determined
by the action of G: u · λ = λ · u. Hence, the only thing that matters is the existence
of a principal G-bundle over B:

Lemma 8.2.3. An extension (8.10) represents the trivial T -gerbe iﬀ ˇH 1
i.e. iﬀ there exists a B-ﬁbered principal G-bundle P over B.

B(B, G) 6= ∅,

Changing the point of view we also see that G is itself determined, via the gauge

construction, by P and its structure of principal T -bundle. Hence:

Corollary 8.2.4. An extension (8.10) represents the trivial T -gerbe iﬀ it is the
gauge extension associated to a B-ﬁbered principal T -bundle (Example 8.2.1).

8.2.3. The Dixmier-Douady class: We now recall the construction of the Dixmier-
Douady class of the gerbe represented by the extension (8.10). It is the obstruction
to triviality that arises from the characterization given in Lemma 8.2.3: any princi-
pal bundle P as in the lemma is pushed forward via the map G → M ×B M to the
principal M ×B M -bundle over B which is M itself, hence the triviality question
amounts to deciding whether [M ] ∈ ˇH 1
B(B, G). This
lifting problem can be translated to the language of cocycles. One chooses a good
cover {Vi}i∈I of B with local sections si : Vi → M of the projection into B (maps
in ManB!). Then the ˇCech cocycle describing M as an element in ˇH 1
B(B, M ×B M )
is given by

B(B, M ×B M ) comes from ˇH 1

gij = (si, sj) : Vij → M ×B M,

and the issue is wether one can lift this cocycle along the projection G → M ×B M
of the extension, to a cocycle with values in G.

Viewing G as a T -torsor over M ×B M , we denote by Gi,j its pull-back via (si, sj):

Gi,j := {g ∈ G : t(g) = si(x), s(g) = sj(x) for some x ∈ Vij }.

Since the Vij are contractible, this T -torsor is trivializable and we can ﬁnd a section:

looking at triple intersections, on which we deﬁne

The only issue is that {egij} may fail to be a cocycle. The obstruction arises by

(8.12)

egij : Vij → Gi,j ,
egij 7→ gij = (si, sj).
cijk :=egij ·egjk ·egki ∈ Γ(Vijk, T ).

This is indeed a section of T since everything ﬁbers over B!

Deﬁnition 8.2.5. The Dixmier-Douady class of the extension is the cohomol-
ogy class represented by the ˇCech 2-cocycle:

c2(G) := [{cijk}] ∈ ˇH 2

B(B, T ) ∼= H 3(B, ΛT ).

When T = S1 × B → B with associated lattice ΛT = Z ⊂ R, we recover the

usual Dixmier-Douady class of an S1-gerbe living in H 3(B, Z).

It is clear that c2(G) = 0 if and only if G represents the trivial gerbe. Indeed,
the assumption that the 2-cocycle cijk is exact gives us, eventually after passing to
a reﬁnement, smooth functions λij : Vij → T , ﬁbered over B, such that:

cijk(x) = λij · λjk · λkj .

Then we can use the action of TM on G to correct theegij:

ij .

gij :=egij · λ−1

We still have that gij 7→ gij and that gij · gjk · gki = 0, so that gij : Vij → G is a
1-cocycle representing an element [P ] ∈ ˇH 1

B(B, G) with i([P ]) = [M ].

The previous constructions can be interpreted as a connecting “homomorphism”
construction, c2(G) = δ([M ]), where δ arises from the short exact sequence (8.10):

ˇH 1

B(B, G)

i

/ ˇH 1

B(B, M ×B M )

δ

/ ˇH 2

B(B, T ) = H 2(B, T ) .

(8.13)

A formal argument shows that this is exact, i.e. Im(i) = δ−1(0). Here and in what
follows we will use the additive notation for the group structure of H 2(B, T ), hence
0 for its identity. Lemma 8.2.3 combined with the remark that ˇH 1
B(B, M ×B M )
contains only one element, namely [M ], shows that the statement that “G represents
the trivial gerbe iﬀ c2(G) = 0” is equivalent to the exactness of (8.13).

The last interpretation of the Dixmier-Douady class, via (8.13), makes it rather
clear that it only depends on the Morita equivalence class of the extension. Indeed,
a Morita (G1, G2)-bibundle Q allows one to transport a principal G1-bundle P → B
along the Morita equivalence yielding a principal G2-bundle P ⊗G1 Q → B. This
leads to a bijection in Haeﬂiger cohomology:

Q∗ : ˇH 1

B(B, G1) ∼= ˇH 1

B(B, G2).

Because of the naturally of the construction, one obtains a commutative diagram

which implies that c2(G1) = c2(G2). Of course, this can also be proved using ˇCech
cocycles. The details for the cocycle argument will be given in the next subsection
in the context of symplectic gerbes.

8.2.4. The Dixmier-Douady class as a group isomorphism. The additivity of the
Dixmier-Douady class:

c2(G1 ⋆ G2) = c2(G1) + c2(G2),

can be checked using a formal argument based on the interpretation of c2 via the
exact sequence (8.13), starting from the remark that G1 ×B G2 deﬁnes a T ×T -gerbe
over M1 ×B M2. Alternatively, one can also give a “down to earth” argument in
terms of cocycles. Again, the details of the direct approach will be given in the
next section in the context of symplectic gerbes.

Since c2(G) = 0 if and only if G represents the trivial gerbe, we conclude that c2
is an injective group homomorphism. Since the base manifold M of our extensions
is allowed to be disconnected, c2 is also surjective: any class u ∈ H 2(B, T ) is
represented by a ˇCech cocycle {cijk} with respect to a good cover V = {Vi}i∈I of
B, so taking M to be the disjoint union of the Vi, we see that {cijk} becomes a
2-cocycle on the resulting groupoid M ×B M with coeﬃcients in TM , and we let G
to be the corresponding extension.

Putting everything together, one obtains the central result of the theory:

Theorem 8.2.6. The Dixmier-Douady class induces an isomorphism between the
group of T -gerbes over B and H 2(B, T ).

8.3. Symplectic gerbes and their Lagrangian class. We are interested in the
extension of gerbes to the symplectic world. Similar to the passage from torsors
to symplectic torsors (Section 8.1), we replace torus bundles by symplectic torus
bundles over B. Hence, our starting point is an integral aﬃne manifold (B, Λ) with
its the associated symplectic torus bundle (T , ωT ) = (T ∗B, ωcan)/Λ.

Deﬁnition 8.3.1. Let (B, Λ) be a smooth integral aﬃne manifold with associated
torus bundle (T , ωT ). A symplectic (T , ωT )-gerbe over B is a symplectic Morita
equivalence class of central extensions of the form:

1

(8.14)

where pM : M → B is a surjective submersion, TM = p∗
plectic groupoid with i∗Ω = p∗

M ωT .

M T and (G, Ω) is a sym-

Remark 8.3.2. Symplectic Morita equivalence of extensions is the symplectic ver-
sion of the notion from the previous section (see Appendix A). We continue to allow
symplectic groupoids over a disconnected base (and possibly with disconnected s-
ﬁbers). This does not aﬀect the basic property that M carries a Poisson structure
π. When dealing with extensions (8.14) with connected s-ﬁbers, then G will make
(M, π) into a Poisson manifold of proper type for which the associated leaf space
is the integral aﬃne manifold (B, Λ).

Example 8.3.3. The symplectic analogue of Example 8.2.1 is the (symplectic)
X associated to a free Hamiltonian T -spaces q : (X, ΩX ) → B,

The fusion product of extensions has a straightforward symplectic version:

in
the product G1 ×B G2 one considers the closed 2-form pr∗
2 Ω2 and a simple
computation shows that the kernel of this form is precisely the orbits of the diagonal
T -action on G1 ×B G2, so this form induces a multiplicative symplectic form Ω1 ⋆ Ω2
on the quotient G1 ⋆ G2. We deﬁne the fusion of symplectic (T , ωT )-gerbes by:

1 Ω1 − pr∗

(G1, Ω1) ⋆ (G2, Ω2) := (G1 ⋆ G2, Ω1 ⋆ Ω2).

As in the case of T -gerbes, the trivial symplectic (T , ωT )-gerbe is represented
by (T , ωT ) and the inverse of the symplectic (T , ωT )-gerbe deﬁned by (8.14) is the
one represented by the Gopp with the same symplectic form Ω. Moreover, we have
obvious symplectic isomorphisms:

(G, Ω) ⋆ (T , ωT ) ∼= (T , ωT ) ⋆ (G, Ω) ∼= (G, Ω)

(G1, Ω1) ⋆ (G2, Ω2) ∼= (G2, Ω2) ⋆ (G1, Ω1)

((G1, Ω1) ⋆ (G2, Ω2)) ⋆ (G3, Ω3) ∼= (G1, Ω1) ⋆ ((G2, Ω2) ⋆ (G3, Ω3))

We conclude that the set of symplectic (T , ωT )-gerbes over B is an abelian group
with the operation induced by the fusion product.

For the symplectic version of the Dixmier-Douady class and of Theorem 8.2.6 it
is not surprising, given the discussion from Section 8.1, that we now have to replace
T by the subsheaf T Lagr of local Lagrangian sections:

Theorem 8.3.4. Given a symplectic groupoid (G, Ω) ⇒ M ﬁtting into an extension
(8.14) there is an associated cohomology class:

c2(G, Ω) ∈ H 2(B, T Lagr).

(8.15)

Moreover:

(i) this construction induces an isomorphism between the group of symplectic

(T , ωT )-gerbes over B and H 2(B, T Lagr).

(ii) c2(G, Ω) = 0 iﬀ G is the gauge extension associated to a free Hamiltonian

T -space (Example 8.3.3).

The class c2(G, Ω) is called the Lagrangian Dixmier-Douady class of the
symplectic gerbe. The rest of this section is devoted to the proof of this theorem.

8.3.1. Construction of the Lagrangian Dixmier-Douady class. We proceed like in
the previous section, and using the same notations. We choose the local sections
si : Vi → M giving rise to the 1-cocycle gi,j = (si, sj) and we form the T -torsor Gij
over Vij . This is now a symplectic torsor, with the symplectic form inherited from
(G, Ω), so the bundle projection Gij → Vij is a Lagrangian ﬁbration with connected

ﬁbers. Since the Vij are contractible, we can choose the liftsegij to be Lagrangian.

Using the multiplicativity of the symplectic form on G, it is straightforward to check
that the resulting 2-cocycle (8.12) is made of Lagrangian sections:

cijk =egij ·egjk ·egki ∈ Γ(Vijk, TLagr).

A tedious but straightforward argument shows that the resulting cohomology class
does not depend on the choices involved; this deﬁnes our Lagrangian Dixmier-
Douady class:

c2(G, Ω) ∈ H 2(B, T Lagr).

Note that the characterization of the extensions which represent the trivial gerbes
given by Lemma 8.2.3, has a straightforward version in the symplectic case. This
implies part (ii) of Theorem 8.3.4.

Remark 8.3.5. A symplectic version of the exact sequence (8.13) leads to an
interpretation of the Lagrangian Dixmier-Douady class as the image of a connecting
morphism of the class of (M, π), as in the standard case:

c2(G, Ω) = δ([(M, π)]) ∈ H 2(B, T Lagr).

8.3.2. Independence of the Morita class. In order to show invariance under sym-
plectic Morita equivalence, assume we are given two extensions:

Vi is contractible, it has a Lagrangian section, i.e. we ﬁnd ui : Vi → P such that

that there exist unique λij : Vij → T such that:

Because ui, uj and ega

obtain for x ∈ Uijk:

ui(x) = λij (x) ·eg1

ij(x) · uj(x) ·eg2

ji(x)

(x ∈ Vij ).

ji are Lagrangian sections, the actions of Ga on P are sym-

plectic, and ωT is multiplicative, it follows that λij is also Lagrangian.

Looking at triple intersections, and using that the actions of TMa commute, we

λij (x) ·eg1

ij(x) · λjk(x) ·eg1

jk(x) · λki(x) ·eg1

ki(x) =eg2

ij(x) ·eg2

jk(x) ·eg2

which can be written as:

ki(x),

ijk(x) − c1

ijk = λij (x) + λjk(x) + λki(x).

Hence, passing to cohomology we have c2(G1, Ω1) = c2(G2, Ω2).

8.3.3. The Lagrangian Dixmier-Douady class as a group isomorphism. We now
turn to the additivity of the Dixmier-Douady class:

To represent the Dixmier-Douady class of (G1 ⋆ G2, Ω1 ⋆ Ω2) we start with the
data used to construct c2(Ga, Ωa) for a ∈ {1, 2}: a covering {Vi}i∈I and sections

ijk given by (8.16). But now observe that
these give similar data for G1 ⋆ G2: the sections si = (s1

associated 1-cocycle gij = (g1

ij) and then the Lagrangian lift

ij = (sa

ij) : Vij → G1 ×B G2 with the projection into G1 ⋆ G2.

Finally, note that the argument on the injectivity and the surjectivity of c2 from

the previous subsection straightforwardly adapts to the present context.

8.4. Lagrangian Dixmier-Douday class vs Dazord-Delzant class. Given an
extension (8.14) let us observe now that there is an obvious isomorphism of sheaves:

p−1(T Lagr) ∼= TM cl,

so there is an induced map at the level of cohomology:

p∗ : ˇH 2(B, T Lagr) → ˇH 2(M, TM cl).

(8.17)

This map allows to express the precise relationship between the Lagrangian Dixmier-
Douady class of the extension and the Delzant-Dazord class of the underlying Pois-
son manifold (see Section 7.5):

Proposition 8.4.1. Under (8.17) the class c2(G, Ω) ∈ ˇH 2(B, T Lagr) of a symplectic
(T , ωT )-gerbe with representative (G, Ω) ⇒ (M, π) is mapped to the obstruction class
c2(M, π, ΛG) ∈ ˇH 2(M, TM cl).
Proof. Start with the data (8.16) to construct the cocyle cijk representing c2(G, Ω):
a cover {Vi}i∈I of B, sections si : Vi → M of p : M → B and the Lagrangian lifts

proposition it is enough to show that

egij : Vij → G of the 1-cocycle gij = (si, sj). Since p : M → B is open, to prove the

cijk ◦ p : p−1(Vijk) → p∗Tcl,

is a 2-cocycle representing c2(M, π, ΛG).

For each i ∈ I, we cover the open sets p−1(Vi) by contractible open sets. The
collection of all such open sets, denoted {Ua}a∈A, is an open cover of M which
comes with a map of the indices A → I, a 7→ ia, such that:

p−1(Vi) = [ia=i

Ua.

Since the Ua are contractible, we can pick local sections σa : Ua → G(Tia , −)
of the principal T |Via -bundle t : G(Tia , −) → p−1(Via ). Now observe that on the
intersection Uab, we have two sections of this principal bundle: the restriction σa|Uab
and the section:

It follows that there exist λab : Uab → TVia such that:

(x ∈ Uab).

σb(x) ·egibia (p(x)),
σa(x) = σb(x) ·egibia (p(x)) · λab(x).

Using this relation successively for σa, σb and σc, we conclude that for x ∈ Uabc:

Using the fact that TM is abelian, we conclude that:

1 =egiaic (p(x)) · λca(x) ·egicib (p(x)) · λbc(x) ·egibia (p(x)) · λab(x)

egiaib ·egibic ·egibia = λab + λbc + λca,

where we are now viewing λab : Uab → TM . This says that under the map (8.17) the
class c2(G, Ω), represented by the 2-cocycle cijk, is mapped to a class represented
by the 2-cocycle λab + λbc + λca : Uabc → TM . But now observe that:
(a) The map t : (G(Tia , −), Ω) → p−1(Via ) is an isotropic realization, so it follows
aΩ is a closed 2-form on Ua extending the leafwise symplectic form ωFπ ;

where we used the fundamental property of ωT and that the egiaib are La-

It follows that the 2-cocycle λab + λbc + λca takes values in (TM )cl and represents
the obstruction class c2(M, π, ΛG), so the proof is completed.
(cid:3)

Remark 8.4.2. In general, the map (8.17) fails to be injective. Hence, it is possible
to have a proper symplectic integration (G, Ω) ⇒ (M, π) such that c2(G, Ω) 6= 0,
but c2(M, π, ΛG) = 0.
In this case, the Poisson manifold (M, π) admits rather
diﬀerent proper integrations deﬁning the same lattice: one of them arising from
free Hamiltonian reduction (Theorem 7.5.3) and the other one not. When the
ﬁbers of p : M → B (the symplectic leaves) are 1-connected, a spectral sequence
argument shows that (8.17) is injective, and we conclude that either all proper
integrations of (M, π, Λ) arise from free Hamiltonian TΛ-reduction, or none of them
does.

9. Symplectic gerbes over orbifolds

We now extend the theory of symplectic gerbes over manifolds to the case of
orbifolds. Of course, our motivation comes from the fact that the leaf spaces of
PMCTs are, in general, orbifolds. As in Section 8, we start with a simpliﬁed
statement of our results, generalizing Theorem 8.0.5:

Theorem 9.0.3. Let (G, Ω) ⇒ M be a proper integration of (M, π), inducing the
orbifold atlas B = B(G) on the leaf space B = M/Fπ. Then (G, Ω) gives rise to a
symplectic gerbe over (B, B), which is classiﬁed by a cohomology class

c2(G, Ω) ∈ H 2(B, T Lagr).

Moreover, c2(G, Ω) vanishes iﬀ G = BX(M, π), the B-integration of (M, π) relative
to a proper isotropic realization q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) (cf. Deﬁnition 7.4.1).

The passage from symplectic gerbes over manifolds to symplectic gerbes over
orbifolds is based on Haeﬂiger’s philosophy explained in Remark 2.6.8. So through-
out this section we ﬁx an orbifold (B, B), with atlas B ⇒ N . The reader should
keep in mind, as main examples: the smooth case of the previous section where B
is B ⇒ B (hence N = B), and the leaf space of a proper Poisson manifold (M, π)
with proper integration G, where B(G) ⇒ M will be the foliation groupoid from
Theorem 2.6.9 (hence N = M ).

To handle various geometric structures on the orbifold (B, B) one may, in prin-
ciple, represent them with respect to the atlas B. However, for some purposes this
may not be the most convenient atlas, so we will be looking at other orbifold atlases
E ⇒ M related to B through a speciﬁed Morita equivalence

The organization of this section is similar to that of Section 8, so we will describe

ﬁrst torsors over orbifolds and then gerbes over orbifolds.

QE : E ≃ B.

9.1. Symplectic torsors over integral aﬃne orbifolds.

9.1.1. Torus orbibundles. The notion of a torus orbibundle T over (B, B) is very
similar to the notion of vector orbibundle (see Remark 5.2.1): they are represented
by a B-torus bundle T , i.e. a torus bundle over M endowed with an action of B:

gives rise to a 1-1 correspondence between (isomorphism classes of) E1-torus bundles
T1 and E2-torus bundles T2. The correspondence is deﬁned by the condition that
there is a left E1-equivariant and right E2-equivariant isomorphism of torus bundles:

Here, the left action of E1 on q∗
the left action on q∗
E1 takes an element (u, λ) in the ﬁber of q∗
y = q2(x) = q2(x′), to the element (g · u, λ) in the ﬁber of q∗
for the right actions. Explicitly, starting from T1 we obtain T2 as q∗

1T1 it is the lift of the original action of E1 on T1, while
2T2 is the tautological one: the action of an arrow g : x → x′ of
2T2 above x, q1(u) = x, λ ∈ T2,y where
2T2 above x′. Similarly

1T1/E1.

As in 8.1.1, it is useful to look at the more general notion of H-principal bundle
over (B, B), for an arbitrary Lie groupoid H ⇒ M . By that we mean a (right)
H-principal bundle P over M , together with a left action of B,

such that all the axioms from the notion of Morita equivalence are satisﬁed, except
for the condition that the action of B is principal. We denote by BunH(B) the set
of isomorphism classes of such bundles.

A description in terms of transition functions/ ˇCech cocycles similar to (8.3)
works well when B is ´etale. For that we need the embedding category EmbU (B)
associated to a basis U for the topology of N [51]. This is the discrete category
whose objects are all open sets U ∈ U, and whose arrows σ : U → V are bisections
σ : U → B such that s ◦ σ = idU and t ◦ σ : U → V is an embedding. The
composition of σ with another arrow τ from V to W is given by

(τ ◦ σ)(x) := τ (t(σ(x)) · σ(x).

Given a principal H-bundle P over (B, B), one choses U such that p : P → N has
local sections sU over each U ∈ U. Fixing the {sU }U∈U , one obtains:

• for each U ∈ U, a smooth map fU : U → M , namely fU := q ◦ sU .
• for each arrow σ : U → V in EmbU (B), a smooth map gσ : U → H so that

gσ(x) : fU (x) → fV (tσ(x)),

σ(x) · sU (x) = sV (t(σ(x))) · gσ(x).

The collection {fU , gσ} will satisfy the cocycle condition

gτ ◦σ(x) = gτ (t(σ(x))) · gσ(x).

Conversely, P can be recovered from the family {fU , gσ} and it is clear that the
usual discussion on transition functions/ ˇCech cocycles extends to this setting.

9.1.2. Symplectic torus orbibundles. For the notion of symplectic torus orbi-
bundles the discussion is simpler when one works with an ´etale atlases E: we
just require that TE comes with a symplectic structure which is multiplicative and
which is invariant under the action of E. Passing to a non-´etale B ⇒ N , the non-
degeneracy of the 2-form is lost and the symplectic torus orbibundle is represented
by a presymplectic torus bundle (T , ωT ) ⇒ N satisfying (see Proposition 3.2.8):
(i) the kernel of ωT coincides with the image of the inﬁnitesimal action of B.
(ii) the action of B on (T , ωT ) is presymplectic (exactly as in Lemma 7.2.7).
The ﬁrst condition holds if and only if holds at units, i.e. if

(i)’ the foliation induced by (T , ωT ) on M coincides with the orbits of B ⇒ M .

Moreover, when B is s-connected then (ii) follows from (i) (see Appendix A).

Example 9.1.1. The ﬁrst part of Lemma 7.2.4, together with Lemma 7.2.7 can be
reformulated as saying that an isotropic realization gives rise to a symplectic torus
orbibundle (T , ωT ) over the classical orbifold M/Fπ .

9.1.3. T -torsors over an orbifold. Given a torus orbibundle T over an orbifold
(B, B), a T -torsor over (B, B) is a T -torsor X over the base N of B, together with
a (left) action of B on X which is compatible with the action of T in the sense that
for u ∈ X and λ ∈ T above x ∈ N and b : x → y in B, one has:

where b(λ) refers to the action of B on T .

This notion can be transported along Morita equivalences, hence X can be rep-
resented similarly with respect to any other atlases (9.1). To see this directly is
rather tedious, but the “ﬁbered point of view” allows for a simple formal argument.

Remark 9.1.2 (Fibered point of view). As in the previous section when (B, B)
was a manifold, it is useful to realize that all our objects are “B-ﬁbered”, i.e. they
come with a “map” into B. For example, while torus bundles over a manifold B
can be looked at as group-like objects in the category ManB of manifolds ﬁbered
over B (see Remark 8.1.1), one should think of a torus bundle T over (B, B) as
encoding a group-like object in the category of groupoids ﬁbered over B, namely
T ⋊⋉ B ⇒ N with the obvious projection into B.

Furthermore, it is useful to relax the notion of “map” between groupoids from
smooth functors to Morita maps [38] (also called Hilsum-Skandalis maps [41, 54]).
For these generalized maps, the resulting “generalized isomorphisms” will be pre-
cisely the Morita equivalences. One thinks of a principal G2-bundle over G1 (in the
sense described above) as a graph of a map from G1 to G2. Hence such a principal
bundle will also be called a Morita map from G1 to G2 and we set:

Given a third groupoid G3 one has a composition operation:

M(G1, G2) = BunG2(G1).

M(G1, G2) × M(G2, G3) → M(G1, G3),

(P, Q) 7→ Q ◦ P = P ×M2 Q/G2.

Moreover, any smooth morphism F : G1 → G2 can be thought of as a Morita map

PF := M1 ×M2 G2 ∈ M(G1, G2),

where the actions of Gi on PF are the obvious ones. More details on Morita maps
can be found in [1, 41, 44, 52, 54].

Now, while a torus bundle T over (B, B) may be thought of as encoding the
groupoid T ⋊⋉ B endowed with the obvious projection into B, a T -torsor X over

where q1(u, b) = pX (u), q2(u, b) = s(b) and the left/right actions on an element
(u, b) ∈ X ×N B are:

b0 · (u, b) = (b0 · u, b0b),

(u, b) · (λ, b1) = (u · b(λ), bb1).

This bibundle describes a Morita map from B to T ⋊⋉ B, which is a right inverse
to the projection T ⋊⋉ B → B. Conversely, from a Morita map P ∈ M(B, T ⋊⋉ B)
right inverse to the projection prB : T ⋊⋉ B → B, one recovers X as X := P/B,
with pX induced by q1, and the obvious left action of B. For the right action of
T on X one remarks that the condition that P be a right inverse makes P into a
principal T -bundle over B, with some projection map pr : P → B. Using this, for
u ∈ X and λ ∈ T in the ﬁber above pX(u), one deﬁnes

u · λ := p · b−1(λ)

where p ∈ P is any representative of u and b = pr(p). All together, one obtains:

Lemma 9.1.3. The construction X 7→ X ×N B describes, up to isomorphism, a
1-1 correspondence between:

(i) T -torsors X over (B, B).
(ii) Morita maps P ∈ M(B, T ⋊⋉ B) which are sections of prB : T ⋊⋉ B → B.

9.1.4. Symplectic T -torsors over an orbifold. In the case of presymplectic torus
bundles (T , ωT ) one can talk about symplectic (T , ωT )-torsors over (B, B): then
X comes with a closed 2-form ΩX and one requires that both actions X ×N T → X
and B ×N X → X are compatible with the 2-forms that are present:

Again, the situation is simpler when B is ´etale, when the condition on the left
action simply says that the form on X is B-invariant. Lemma 9.1.3 has an obvious
“symplectic version”, which uses (pre)symplectic bibundles (Appendix A).

9.2. Symplectic gerbes over integral aﬃne orbifolds.

9.2.1. Gerbes over orbifolds. We now ﬁx a torus bundle T over the orbifold (B, B).

Here TE → M is the E-torus bundle which represents T in the new atlas. Such
an extension induces an action of E on TE obtained by lifting the elements of E to
elements of G and conjugating by the lifts. A central extension is one for which
the induced action coincides with the original action of E on TE . From now on we
consider only central extensions, with no further notice.

Gi, relative to two foliated orbifold atlases Ei ⇒ Mi. Notice that the two atlases

where Q = QE1,E2 is obtained by composing QE1 : E1 ≃ B with the inverse of

(9.4)

Deﬁnition 9.2.1. A Morita equivalence of extensions (9.2) is a Morita equiv-
alence P between the two groupoids,

together with a submersion pr : P → Q satisfying the following properties:

(i) it is left G1-equivariant and right G2-equivariant, where the actions of Gi on

Q are induced from the actions of Ei via the submersions Gi → Ei;

(ii) it is a (left) principal TE1 -bundle and a (right) principal TE2 -bundle;

(iii) the two torus actions on P are compatible: ifeu ∈ P and u = pr(eu) ∈ Q, then

∀ λ ∈ TE2,q2(u).

Example 9.2.2 (Pullback of extensions). Central extensions cannot be transpor-
ted along general Morita maps or equivalences, so they behave quite diﬀerently
than the other types of objects over orbifolds that we looked at so far. However,
extensions can be pulled-back. First of all, an atlas QE : E ≃ B for the orbifold
(B, B), with E ⇒ M , can be pulled-back along any smooth map

eu · λ = λu ·eu,

q : P → M

that is transverse to the leaves of the orbit foliation on M induced by E. It gives
rise to the new atlas q∗E ⇒ P , where q∗E = P ×M E ×M P is the pull-back groupoid
and Qq∗E = P ×M QE. Now, given an extension (9.2) over E, one has a pull-back
extension over the orbifold atlas q∗E:

1

/ Tq∗E

/ q∗G

/ q∗E

/ 1 ,

where q∗G is the pull-back groupoid, while Tq∗E is the pull-back bundle. Notice
that G ×M P gives a Morita bibundle between G and q∗G.

In particular, extensions can be pulled-back via submersions, without aﬀecting
the Morita class. One can also take for q the inclusion of a complete transversal,
and conclude that any extension is Morita equivalent to one over an ´etale atlas.

The pull-back operation can be used to reinterpret and even redeﬁne the notion
of Morita equivalence of extensions. First, a Morita equivalence Q : E1 ≃ E2 induces
an isomorphism of Lie groupoids

E1 corresponds to the point

(u, γ2, u′) where γ2 is uniquely determined by the condition γ1 · u′ = u · γ2. In a
general Morita equivalence between extensions, the conditions on P ensure that the
similar isomorphism P∗ : q∗
2G2 is an isomorphism of extensions (i.e. not only
of groupoids) that is compatible with Q. More precisely, one has an isomorphism

where the left and right vertical maps are the pull-backs of (9.5) and (9.3) via
pr : P → X and we use q∗

. From the previous example, we conclude:

i = pr∗ ◦q∗
i

Corollary 9.2.3. Two central extensions Gi over Mi (i = 1, 2), are Morita equi-
valent if and only if there is a manifold P together with submersions qi : P → Mi
such that the pull-backs q∗

i Gi are isomorphic extensions.

Deﬁnition 9.2.4. Given a torus orbibundle T over the orbifold (B, B), a T -gerbe
over (B, B) is a Morita equivalence class of central extensions (9.2). We say that
the extension represents the gerbe over the atlas QE : E ≃ B.

As we explained above, a general gerbe can be represented only over some orbi-
fold atlas. Still, Example 9.2.2 shows that if a gerbe is represented by an extension
over the atlas QE : E ≃ B, with E ⇒ M , then we can pullback along any map
q : M ′ → M transverse to the orbits of E. Letting q be the inclusion of a complete
transversal, we see that any gerbe can be represented over an ´etale atlas.

9.2.2. Group structure. We start by observing that any atlas QE : E ≃ B for the
orbifold (B, B) comes with a trivial central extension

(9.6)

whose Morita class does not depend on the choice of atlas E. These deﬁne the
trivial T -gerbe over the orbifold (B, B).

Example 9.2.5. As in the smooth case, there are non-trivial extensions that may
still represent the trivial gerbe. Actually, one can give a full characterization of such
extensions, generalizing Corollary 8.2.4 to the orbifold context. The starting point
is an orbifold atlas QE : E ≃ B, with E ⇒ M , and a TE -torsor X over M . This gives
rise to the groupoid EX (M ) = (X ×M E ×M X)/TE exactly as in Deﬁnition 7.4.1
(hence the quotient is modulo the action (7.10)), which ﬁts into a central extension

Moreover, exactly as in Proposition 7.4.4, using X ×M E as Morita bibundle, it
follows that this extension represents the trivial gerbe. For the converse, one uses
an argument similar to that of Lemma 9.1.3.

The inverse T -gerbe of the gerbe deﬁned by an extension (9.2) is represented

by the opposite extension:

/ E opp

/ 1

Note that inversion gives a groupoid isomorphism E ∼= E opp, so this extension rep-
resents a well deﬁned gerbe over the same orbifold.

Next, for the fusion product of extensions, we start with two extensions Gi as
above, relative to two orbifold atlases Ei ⇒ Mi. We still denote by Q the induced
Morita equivalence between E1 and E2, with projections denoted qi : Q → Mi
(i = 1, 2). While the pull-backs of Ei to Q are isomorphic by (9.5), there is a more
symmetric way to represent the resulting groupoid over Q, namely as the ﬁbered
product over M1 (for ⋉) and M2 (for ⋊):

E1,2 := E1 ⋉ Q ⋊ E2.

Indeed, (γ1, u, γ2) 7→ (γ1 · u, γ1) identiﬁes E1,2 with q∗
E2).
1
The groupoid E1,2 ⇒ Q is another atlas for (B, B) and the advantage of this point
of view is that one can deﬁne similarly the groupoid

E1 (and similarly for q∗
2

and the torus bundle:

G1,2 = G1 ⋉ Q ⋊ G2 ⇒ X

T1,2 = TE1 ⋉ Q ⋊ TE2 = q∗
1

TE1 ⊗ q∗
2

TE2.

We now act with the smaller torus bundle (9.3) using, e.g. its left hand side q∗
2
The action is along the map G1,2 → M2, (g1, u, g2) 7→ q
(u) and it is given by

2

TE2.

(g1, u, g2) · λ := (g1 · λu, u, λ · g2),

where we use again the notation (9.4). Finally, we deﬁne the fusion product of
extensions by considering the groupoid

G1 ⋆ G2 := (G1 ⋉ Q ⋊ G2)/T1,2

and the associated central extension over the orbifold atlas E1,2.

It is tedious but straightforward to extend the discussion from the smooth case
to conclude that the fusion product gives rise to a group structure on the set of T -
gerbes over the orbifold (B, B) with the above identity gerbe and inverse operation
on gerbes.

9.2.3. The Dixmier-Douady class. We proceed as in the smooth case, starting with
a characterization of triviality. This is the following generalization of Lemma 8.2.3
to the orbifold case, which should now be obvious:

Lemma 9.2.6. Given a central extension (9.2), the following are equivalent:
(a) it represents the trivial gerbe over (B, B);
(b) there exists a principal G-bundle P over B which lifts the principal E-bundle
over B given by the atlas QE : E ≃ B. Equivalently: P ∈ M(B, G) ﬁts into a
commutative diagram of Morita maps

Next, eventually after pulling back to a complete transversal T ֒→ N , we may
assume that the atlas B ⇒ N is already ´etale. This allows us to use a ˇCech-type
description of orbifold cohomology, due to Moerdijk [51], which we now recall.

We consider abelian sheaves over (B, B), i.e. sheaves S of abelian groups on N
together with an action of B from the right: hence any arrow x → y of B gives a
group homomorphism between germs Sy → Sx. These form an abelian category
with enough injectives and the sheaf cohomology groups H •(B, S) are deﬁned
as the right derived functors associated to the functor Γ(·)B of taking invariant
sections. Hence:

H n(B, S) := H n(Γ(I •)B),

for some injective resolution 0
cohomology is invariant under Morita equivalences.

/ S

/ I 0

/ · · · . This sheaf

For the ˇCech cohomology description we use the embedding category EmbU (B)
[51, Section 7] (see Section 9.1.1) . Similar to the transition functions for principal

bundles over B, any abelian B-sheaf S gives rise to a preseheaf eS on EmbU (B),
i.e. to a contravariant functor A : EmbU (B) → AbGrp. Explicitly, eS associates

to U ∈ U the space S(U ) of sections of S over U and to an arrow σ : U → V
of EmbU (B) the map σ∗ : S(V ) → S(U ) described as follows: for λ ∈ S(V ) the
section σ∗(λ) ∈ S(U ) has germ at x ∈ U :

σ∗(λ)x = λt(σ(x)) · σ(x).

The ˇCech complex of B relative to U with coeﬃcients in S, denoted ( ˇC•
U (B, S), d), is
deﬁned as the standard complex computing the cohomology of the discrete category

EmbU (B) with coeﬃcients in eS. That means:

cohomology are functorial with respect to reﬁnements of covers, so one can pass to
colimits and deﬁne the ˇCech cohomology of the orbifold (B, B) with coeﬃcients
in S as:

We now have the following result:

ˇH •(B, S) = colim H •

U (B, S).

Proposition 9.2.7 ([24]). If H i(U, S) = 0 for i > 0 and all U ∈ U, then

H •(B, S) ∼= ˇH •

U (B, S),

and these isomorphisms are compatible with taking reﬁnements. In particular,

ˇH •(B, S) ∼= H •(B, S).

And here is a result that is relevant for our discussion on orbifolds and which

makes essential use of properness.

Lemma 9.2.8. For any proper ´etale groupoid B and a torus bundle T over B, with
corresponding lattice Λ, one has

H •(B, T ) ∼= H •+1(B, Λ).

Similarly, if (T , ωT ) is a symplectic torus bundle over a proper ´etale groupoid B:

H •(B, T Lagr) ∼= H •+1(B, OΛ).

Proof. The key remark is that, due to the properness of B ⇒ N , for any B-sheaf S
of R-vector spaces which is ﬁne as a sheaf over the base manifold N , one has

H •(B, S) = 0,

∀ k ≥ 1.

Use now the exact sequences induced by (8.5) and (8.8) in cohomology.

(cid:3)

With all the cohomology apparatus in place, we can now proceed to deﬁne the
Dixmier-Douady class of a gerbe over (B, B). The construction is entirely similar to
the smooth case, the main diﬀerence being that we have to start with an extension
(9.2) over an atlas E ⇒ M which may be diﬀerent from B. We denote by Q = QE
the given Morita equivalence between E and B and we would like to measure the
failure of extending Q, viewed as a principal E-bundle over B, to a principal G-
bundle over B. This can be rephrased in terms of transition functions: we choose
the basis U of N together with local sections sU : U → Q of q2 : Q → N , so that
we can consider the transition system {fU , gσ}. We may assume that each U ∈ U
is contractible. For each arrow σ : U → V of EmbU (B), the pull-back of pr : G → E
via gσ : U → E gives a T -torsor Gσ → U . Since U is contractible it will admit a

section, i.e. we obtain a lift egσ : U → G of gσ. Of course, the cocycle condition

may fail: for composable arrows U0
of T over U given by

in EmbU (B), one has a section

U1

σ1

σ2

U2

and (σ1, σ2) 7→ cσ1,σ2 deﬁnes a cocyle in C2
U (B, T ). This gives rise to a class in
cohomology which, by the usual arguments, is independent of the various choices:

cσ1,σ2 :=egσ1◦σ2egσ1egσ2

Deﬁnition 9.2.9. The Dixmier-Douady class of the gerbe represented by the
extension (9.2) is

c2(G) := [cσ1,σ2 ] ∈ H 2(B, T ) ∼= H 3(B, Λ).

To see that c2(G) only depends on the Morita equivalence class, one ﬁrst proves

the additivity with respect to the fusion product:

c2(G1 ⋆ G2) = c2(G1) + c2(G2).

This is done exactly like in the smooth case, but using the embedding category.
Also, it is clear that c2(Gopp) = −c2(G). Hence, if G1 and G2 are Morita equivalent
then, since G1 ⋆ Gopp

is Morita equivalent to the trivial extension, we ﬁnd:

2

c2(G1) − c2(G2) = c2(G1 ⋆ Gopp

2

) = 0.

Notice that, by construction, the vanishing of this class is equivalent to the fact
that G represents the trivial gerbe. In this way we have extended the discussion of
gerbes from the smooth to the orbifold case.

Theorem 9.2.10. Given a torus bundle T over the orbifold (B, B) with lattice Λ,
the Dixmier-Douady class induces an isomorphism:

c2 : Gerb(B,B)(T ) → H 2(B, T ) ∼= H 3(B, Λ).

9.2.4. Symplectic gerbes. The symplectic version of gerbes over an orbifold should
now be obvious. One starts with a symplectic torus bundle (T , ωT ) over the orb-
ifold (B, B) or, equivalently, with an integral aﬃne structure. Then one looks at
symplectic central extensions of the form

1

/ TE

i

/ (G, Ω)

pr

/ E

/ 1 ,

(9.7)

where (G, Ω) is now a symplectic groupoid and i∗Ω = ωT . Similarly for the notion
of symplectic Morita equivalence, using symplectic Morita bibundles (Appendix
A.3). Therefore a symplectic (T , ωT )-gerbe over (B, B) is a symplectic Morita
equivalence class of such symplectic central extensions.

The group structure on gerbes is, this time, a bit more subtle; e.g., even the
trivial extension (9.6) may fail to be symplectic. The most satisfactory solution is
to consider presymplectic extensions (see Section 9.3). The shortest solution is to
pass to an ´etale atlas. Indeed, if B is ´etale, then:

• The trivial central extension (9.6) is now symplectic, yielding the trivial
symplectic gerbe. Similarly, the inverse of a symplectic gerbe is symplectic.
• The fusion product of symplectic extensions is a symplectic extension, and

is independent of the symplectic Morita class.

For the construction of the Lagrangian Dixmier-Douady class of a symplectic gerbe,
we assume again that B is ´etale, and we proceed exactly as in the non-symplectic
case, except that in the construction above one now choses Lagrangian sections
sU : U → Q, making use of Corollary 8.1.3. This leads to:

Theorem 9.2.11. Given a symplectic groupoid (G, Ω) ⇒ M ﬁtting into an exten-
sion (9.7) there is an associated cohomology class:

c2(G, Ω) ∈ H 2(B, T Lagr).

Moreover:

(i) this construction induces an isomorphism between the group of symplectic T -

gerbes over (B, B) and H 2(B, T Lagr).

(ii) c2(G, Ω) = 0 if and only if (G, Ω) is isomorphic to EX (M, π), the E-integration

of (M, π) relative to a proper isotropic realization (X, ΩX ) → (M, π).

Finally, let us look at the relationship between gerbes and symplectic gerbes.
At the level of the Dixmier-Douady classes, the relationship is provided by the
cohomology sequence induced by (8.8), which gives:

H 3(B, R)

i∗

/ H 3(B, OΛ)

d∗

/ H 3(B, Λ)

/ H 4(B, R)

(9.8)

Since d∗ maps c2(G, Ω) to c2(G), the preimage d∗−1(c2(G)) is the aﬃne space
c2(G, Ω) + i∗H 3(B, R). A geometric interpretation will be given in the next sec-
tion, using twisted Dirac structures, where the role of H 3(B) will be to provide
the background 3-forms. For now, let us recall a more explicit model for H •(B, R):
in the DeRham complex (Ω•(N ), d) on the base B ⇒ N we consider the subcom-
plex (Ω•(N )B, d) of B-invariant forms. Of course, this makes sense for any ´etale
groupoid B and deﬁnes a cohomology H •

bas(B).

Corollary 9.2.12. For any proper ´etale groupoid B one has natural isomorphisms

H •

bas(B) ∼= H •(B, R).

The concrete description of H •(B, R) can be extended to non-´etale orbifold at-
lases QE : E ≃ B. If E ⇒ M is any proper foliation groupoid one can talk about
forms on M which are E-basic: they are the forms on M whose pull-back via the
source and the target map of E coincide. This deﬁnes a sub-complex (Ω•
bas(E), d)
of the DeRham complex of M and gives rise to a (Morita invariant!) cohomology
of E, denoted H •

bas(E). When E is ´etale, this agrees with the previous deﬁnition.

Corollary 9.2.13. For any proper ´etale groupoid B and any orbifold atlas E ≃ B
one has natural isomorphisms

H •

bas(E) ∼= H •

bas(B) ∼= H •(B, R).

In particular, when H 3

bas(E) = H 3

symplectic extension is trivial, then so is the induced symplectic gerbe.

bas(B) = 0, if the ordinary gerbe deﬁned by a

9.3. The twisted Dirac setting. We close our discussion on gerbes by explaining
brieﬂy how to pass from the Poisson to the (twisted) Dirac setting. The main
outcome will not be a new theory of “twisted presymplectic gerbes”, but a new
way to represent symplectic gerbes by more general extensions.

Let (G, Ω, φ) ⇒ M be φ-twisted presymplectic groupoid integrating a Dirac
manifold (M, L) with background 3-form φ. As discussed in Remark 3.3.3, in the
proper regular case this still gives rise to a central extension

1

/ T (G)

/ (G, Ω)

/ E(G)

/ 1

inducing an integral aﬃne orbifold structure on the space B of orbits, with associ-
ated presymplectic torus bundle T (G) equipped with the restriction of Ω.

Start now with a sympletic torus bundle (T , ωT ) over the orbifold (B, B) and

look at central extensions deﬁned over some orbifold atlas QE : E ≃ B, of type

1

/ TE

/ (G, Ω, φ)

/ E

/ 1 ,

with i∗Ω = ωTE , but where (G, Ω, φ) is now a twisted presymplectic groupoid. Such
an extension will be called a central twisted presymplectic extension on the
integral aﬃne orbifold (B, B). The notion of presymplectic Morita equivalence
between to such extension is deﬁned exactly as in the symplectic case, with the only
diﬀerence that one now allows twisted presymplectic bibundles and the twisting will
vary (see Appendix A). The construction of the Lagrangian Dixmier-Douady
class of such an extension carries over modulo some obvious modiﬁcations, giving

c2(G, Ω, φ) ∈ H 2(B, T Lagr) ∼= H 3(B, OΛ).

However, one does not obtain a new notion of “twisted presymplectic gerbes”:

Proposition 9.3.1. For an integral aﬃne orbifold (B, B), one has that:

(i) any twisted presymplectic extension is presymplectic Morita equivalent to a

symplectic extension;

(ii) two symplectic extensions are presymplectic Morita equivalent if and only if

they are symplectic Morita equivalent.

Proof. Part (i) follows by observing that:
(a) given a (regular) twisted presymplectic groupoid (G, Ω, φ), after restricting to a
complete transversal to the foliation induced on the base, one obtains a twisted
presymplectic groupoid whose 2-form becomes non-degenerate. Moreover, as

/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
PMCT 2

107

in Example 9.2.2, this operation does not change the (presymplectic) Morita
equivalence class;

(b) given an extension (G, Ω, φ) over M and any 2-form τ ∈ Ω2(M ), the original
extension is presymplectic Morita equivalent to its τ -gauge transform (G, Ω −
t∗τ + s∗τ, φ − dτ ). In particular, if φ is exact, then by such a gauge transform
one can pass to an untwisted presymplectic extension.

To prove (ii) we invoke again the fact that a presymplectic Morita equivalence
between symplectic groupoids is automatically symplectic.
(cid:3)

However, it is still interesting to think about twisted presymplectic representa-
tions of symplectic gerbes. To illustrate that let us assume ﬁrst that B is smooth,
so that (9.8) gives us the exact sequence:

H 3(B, R)

i∗

/ H 3(B, OΛ)

d∗

/ H 3(B, Λ) .

(9.9)

From the construction of the Dixmier-Douady classes we immediately deduce:

Proposition 9.3.2. Given an integral aﬃne manifold (B, Λ), any closed 3-form
η ∈ Ω3
cl(B) and a twisted presymplectic extension over the submersion pM : M → B

1

/ (TΛ)M

/ (G, Ω, φ)

/ M ×B M

/ 1 ,

then (G, Ω, φ + p∗

M η) deﬁnes another twisted presymplectic extension with class:

c2(G, Ω, φ + p∗

M η) = c2(G, Ω, φ) + i∗[η].

In particular, even if we are only interested in symplectic extensions, twisted
(symplectic!) ones arise if one wants to understand the diﬀerence between symplec-
tic gerbes and non-symplectic ones:

Corollary 9.3.3. Given an integral aﬃne manifold (B, Λ), if two TΛ-central sym-
plectic extensions (Gi, Ωi) induce the same (non-symplectic) gerbe, i.e. if there is a
Morita equivalence of extensions:

G1 ≃ G2,

then there exists a closed 3-form η on B and a twisted symplectic Morita equivalence
of extensions:

(G1, Ω1) ≃ (G2, Ω2, η).

This discussion can be generalized from a smooth B to orbifolds (B, B) by using
(9.9) instead of (9.8) and the description of H 3(B, R) via basic forms, provided by
Corollary 9.2.13. In other words, one works with presymplectic extensions

1

/ TE

/ (G, Ω, φ)

/ E

/ 1

deﬁned over orbifold atlases QE : E ≃ B and one replaces the closed 3-forms η on B
by E-basic closed 3-forms on the base M of E. One concludes that for any E-basic
3-form η on M , the twisted presymplectic groupoid (G, Ω, φ + η) has class satisfying
the same formula as in the previous proposition.

Remark 9.3.4. It is not hard to see that all our deﬁnitions of (symplectic) gerbes
over orbifolds extend to gerbes over any Lie groupoid (gerbes over stacks) and the
deﬁnition of the (Lagrangian) Dixmier-Douady class makes sense at least for gerbes
over any foliation groupoid.

Appendix A. Symplectic groupoids and moment maps

In this appendix we recall some basic notions and results associated with sym-
plectic groupoids and their actions on symplectic manifolds, which are needed
throughout the paper. Much of this material goes back to the work of Mikami
and Weinstein [49] and Xu [65], complemented by the results in [18].

A.1. Hamiltonian G-spaces. Given a Poisson manifold (M, π) and an integrat-
ing symplectic groupoid (G, Ω), a Hamiltonian G-space is a symplectic manifold
(X, ΩX ) endowed with a smooth map

q : (X, ΩX ) → M,

as well as an action m of G on X along q which symplectic. The condition that the
action is symplectic can be expressed by saying that its graph:

Graph(m) = {(g, x, g · x) : g ∈ G, x ∈ X, s(g) = q(x)} ⊂ G × X × X

is a Lagrangian submanifold of (G × X × X, Ω ⊕ ΩX ⊕ −ΩX). Alternatively, this
condition can be rewritten in the multplicative form:

m∗(ΩX ) = pr∗

1(Ω) + pr∗

2(ΩX ),

where pri are the two projections.

Recall that a Poisson map q : X → M is called complete if for any complete
Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld Xh ∈ X(M ) the pullback Xh◦q ∈ X(X) is complete. The
very ﬁrst basic fact about Hamiltonian G-spaces is:

Lemma A.1.1. Given a symplectic groupoid (G, Ω) integrating the Poisson mani-
fold (M, π) and a symplectic action of (G, Ω) on (X, ΩX ), one has:

(i) q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) is a complete Poisson map;
(ii) the induced inﬁnitesimal action T ∗M on X,

σ : q∗T ∗M → T X,

σ(u, αx) =

satisﬁes the moment map condition

exp(tαx) · u.

d

dt(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

iσ(α)(ΩX ) = q∗α ∀ α ∈ Ω1(M ).

(A.1)

Conversely, if one starts with a Poisson map q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π), it is imme-
diate to check that the moment map condition (A.1) deﬁnes an inﬁnitesimal Lie
algebroid action σ : q∗T ∗M → T X. Moreover, one has:

Lemma A.1.2. Let q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) be a Poisson map with associate inﬁni-
tesimal action σ : q∗T ∗M → T X. Then:

(i) if for some symplectic groupoid (G, Ω) integrating (M, π) the inﬁnitesimal ac-

tion σ integrates to an action of G on X, then the action is symplectic;

(ii) if q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π) is complete, the inﬁnitesimal action always integrate

to a symplectic action of the Weinstein groupoid (Σ(M, π), Ω) on (X, ΩX ).

The standard theory of Hamiltonian G-spaces for a Lie group G is recovered by
letting G = T ∗G = G ⋉ g∗ be the cotangent symplectic groupoid integrating the
linear Poisson structure on g∗, and q : (X, ΩX ) → g∗ be the usual moment map.

PMCT 2

109

A.2. Symplectic quotients of Hamiltonian G-spaces. Given a Hamiltonian
G-space (X, ΩX ), we will say that:
(a) the action is free at u ∈ X if the isotropy group Gu of the action is trivial.
(b) the action is inﬁnitesimally free at u ∈ X if the isotropy group Gu of the
action is discrete. Equivalentely, if the isotropy Lie algebra of the inﬁnitesimal
action σ is trivial, or still if σu is injective. By (A.1) this is also equivalent to
q being a submersion at u.

Symplectic reduction makes sense in the general context of a Hamiltonian G-space
q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, π): the symplectic quotient of (X, ΩX ) at a point x ∈ M is:

X//x G := q−1(x)/Gx.

This carries a canonical symplectic form uniquely determined by the condition that
its pull-back to q−1(x) is ΩX |q−1(x).

As in the classical case, to ensure smoothness one assumes that G is proper and
one restricts to points where the action is free, which form an open dense subspace
of M . The following proposition shows that, in that case, if the ﬁbers of q are
connected, then the symplectic reductions q−1(x)/Gx can be interpreted as the
symplectic leaves of a second Poisson manifold:

Xred := X/G,

which will still be of proper type, with the same space of symplectic leaves as (M, π).

Proposition A.2.1. Let (G, Ω) be a proper symplectic integration of (M, π) and
let q : (X, ΩX) → M be a free Hamiltonian G-space. Then:

(i) Xred is smooth and carries a unique Poisson structure πred making the canon-

A.3. Symplectic Morita equivalence. Free Hamiltonian G-spaces are also the

sition becomes an immediate consequence of one of the main properties of such
equivalences. We start by recalling the deﬁnition (see [65]):

Hence, the two legs in a symplectic Morita equivalence are left/right free Hamil-
tonian Gi-spaces. The two actions are proper, but the groupoids need not be proper.
Similar to the non-symplectic case, one can recover one groupoid in a symplectic
Morita equivalence from the other groupoid and the the bibundle (X, ΩX ) by the
gauge construction:

G2 ∼= X ⋆

X, G1 ∼= X ⋆

G1

X.

G2

This is precisely the construction of (A.2) in Proposition A.2.1.

A Morita equivalence allows to identify various “transversal objects” associated
to G1, such as leaf spaces, isotropy groups,
isotropy Lie algebras, monodromy
groups, etc., with the similar ones of G2. Moreover, in the symplectic case, one
obtains an equivalence between Hamiltonian G1-spaces and Hamiltonian G2-spaces
(see [65]). It is not diﬃcult to see that all these ﬁt nicely together in the proper
case, when the homeomorphism between the two resulting leaf spaces will be a
diﬀeomorphism of integral aﬃne orbifolds and the variation of symplectic areas of
symplectic reductions for Hamiltonian G1-spaces will correspond to the ones for G2.

A.4. Hamiltonian TΛ-spaces. The discussion above is interesting even in the case
of proper integrations of the zero Poisson structure. By Proposition 3.1.6, these
correspond to integral aﬃne structures Λ ⊂ T ∗B: the associated torus bundle
TΛ = T ∗B/Λ can be viewed as a symplectic groupoid integrating (B, π ≡ 0).
Therefore, for any integral aﬃne manifold (B, Λ) one can talk about Hamiltonian
TΛ-spaces in the sense discussed above, and we have:

Corollary A.4.1. Let (B, Λ) be an integral aﬃne manifold and let (X, ΩX ) be a
symplectic manifold endowed with an action of TΛ along a smooth map q : X → B.
Then the following are equivalent:
(a) (X, ΩX ) is a Hamiltonian TΛ-space;
(b) the moment map condition iσ(α)(ΩX ) = q∗α holds for all α ∈ Ω1(B), where
σ : q∗T ∗B → T X is the inﬁnitesimal action induced by the action of TΛ on X.

From Proposition A.2.1 and the discussion on Morita equivalences we deduce:

Corollary A.4.2. Given an integral aﬃne manifold (B, Λ) and a free TΛ-Hamil-
tonian space q : (X, ΩX ) → B, with quotient Xred := X/TΛ, one has:

(i) There a unique Poisson structure πred on Xred carries such that the projection

is a Poisson submersion with connected ﬁbers:

p : (X, ΩX ) → (Xred, πred).

(A.3)

Moreover, p makes (X, ΩX ) into a proper isotropic realization of (Xred, πred).

(ii) (Xred, πred) admits the following proper integrating symplectic groupoid:

X ⋆
TΛ

X := (X ×B X) /TΛ ⇒ Xred,

(A.4)

with the 2-form induced from the 2-form pr∗

Note that the s-ﬁbers of the gauge groupoid (A.4) are copies of the q-ﬁbers, so we
we conclude that Xred is of proper type when the ﬁbers of q are connected. There
are examples where the ﬁbers are not connected, the gauge groupoid is proper, but
its source connected component fails to be proper.

We show in Section 3.1 that Hamiltonian TΛ-spaces are nothing more than La-
grangian ﬁbrations (X, ΩX ) → B inducing the integral aﬃne structure Λ on B.
When B = Tn with its standard integral aﬃne structure, TΛ is the trivial Tn-
bundle over Tn and Hamiltonian TΛ-spaces are the same thing as quasi-Hamiltonian
Tn-spaces in the sense of (Reference [4]).

A.5. The twisted Dirac case. Let us mention brieﬂy how to modify the previous
discussion in the case of twisted Dirac manifolds. For details see (Reference ????).
Given a presymplectic groupoid (G, Ω, φ) integrating a twisted Dirac manifold
(M, L) with background 3-form φ ∈ Ω2(M ), a Hamiltonian G-space consists of
a manifold X, endowed with a 2-form ΩX , together with a smooth map

q : (X, ΩX ) → M,

as well as an action m of G on X along q, satisfying:
(a) multiplicativity: m∗(ΩX ) = pr∗
(b) twisting: dΩX − q∗φ is horizontal relative to the action.
For such a Hamiltonian G-space, the map q : (X, ΩX ) → (M, L) is a forward Dirac
map. One also has analogues of Lemmas A.1.1 and A.1.2.

1(Ω) + pr∗

2(ΩX );

For a free Hamiltonian G-space, the reduced space:

Xred := X/G,

now carries a unique φred-twisted Dirac structure Lred for which the projection
p : (X, ω) → (Xred, Lred) is a forward Dirac map and the twisting satisﬁes:

Hence, the two legs in a presymplectic Morita equivalence are left/right free
Hamiltonian Gi-spaces and one can recover one groupoid from the other groupoid
and the bibundle (X, ΩX ) by the gauge construction:

G2 ∼= X ⋆

Note that a twisted presymplectic groupoid maybe presymplectic Morita equi-

valent to a non-twisted symplectic groupoid. Moreover, it is easy to check that:

(i) Any φ-twisted presymplectic groupoid (G, Ω, φ) ⇒ (M, L) is presymplectic
Morita equivalent to its restriction to a complete transversal G|T ⇒ T , which
is a twisted symplectic groupoid with twisting the restriction of φ to the
transversal T ;

(ii) A presymplectic Morita equivalence between two symplectic groupoids is ac-

tually a symplectic Morita equivalence.

Finally, given a 2-form B ∈ Ω2(M ), there is a presymplectic Morita equivalence
between a φ-twisted presymplectic groupoid (G, Ω) ⇒ (M, L) and its B-transform,
namely the (φ + dB)-twisted presymplectic groupoid (G, Ω′) ⇒ (M, eBL), where
Ω′ = Ω + t∗B − s∗B.

Appendix B. Proper transverse integral affine foliations

In this section we show that some of the ideas from Molino’s structure theory
of riemannian foliations ([52, 53]) can be adapted to the case of transverse integral
aﬃne foliations proving in particular that the leaf spaces of proper transverse inte-
gral aﬃne foliations are good orbifolds, i.e. global quotients modulo proper actions
of discrete groups.
In the terminology of [61, 36], we show that proper integral
aﬃne foliations are complete.

Throughout this section we ﬁx a foliated manifold (M, F ) together with a trans-

verse integral aﬃne structure Λ ⊂ ν∗(F ).

B.1. Transverse integral aﬃne structures and the foliation holonomy. We
start by investigating the inﬂuence of the transverse integral aﬃne structure Λ on
the holonomy of F Note ﬁrst that the various groupoids associated to the foliation
discussed in Section 2.1 ﬁt into a sequence of groupoid morphisms

Mon(M, F )

hol

/ Hol(M, F )

lin /

/ Hollin(M, F ) ⊂ GLΛ(ν(F )),

where the Λ in the last factor is justiﬁed by the fact that the holonomy of the
foliation preserves Λ. As pointed out in Section 2.1, unlike the other groupoids in
this sequence, Hollin(M, F ) does not have a smooth structure making lin smooth
unless the holonomy is linear.

Proposition B.1.1. If (M, F ) admits a transverse integral aﬃne structure then
its holonomy is linear, i.e.
lin is bijective. Moreover, with the induced smooth
structure, Hollin(M, F ) is an immersed Lie subgroupoid of GL(ν(F )).

Proof. For a leafwise path γ from x to y, choosing small transversals S through
x and T through y, the induced holonomy germ hol(γ) : (S, x) → (T, y) preserves
the integral aﬃne structures on the transversals. Using transverse integral aﬃne
charts, we obtain a a germ of a diﬀeomorphism Rq → Rq around the origin which
preserves the standard integral aﬃne structure. Such germs are clearly linear. (cid:3)

/
PMCT 2

113

Note that Hollin(M, F ) ⊂ GL(ν(F )) may fail to be an embedding: one example
is given by the the Kronecker foliation on the torus, with an irrational slope. This
problem will soon disappear, once we assume properness of the foliation.

Next we compare the holonomy of the foliation, which we will refer to as F -
holonomy, with the ones associated to the transverse integral aﬃne. Recall from
Section 5.1 that, associated to Λ, we consider:

• the linear holonomy hlin : Π1(M ) → GLΛ(ν(F )) with image denoted by

Πlin

1 (M, Λ) ⊂ GLΛ(ν(F )).

• the aﬃne holonomy hAﬀ : Π1(M ) → Aﬀ Λ(ν(F )) with image denoted by

ΠAﬀ

1 (M, Λ) ⊂ Aﬀ Λ(ν(F )).

While the holonomies associated to Λ are deﬁned on Π1(M ), the F -holonomy is
deﬁned on Mon(M, F ). Hence, to compare the two, we will use the tautological
map sending the leafwise homotopy class of a leafwise path to its homotopy class
as a path in M :

i∗ : Mon(M, F ) → Π1(M ).

Proposition B.1.2. For a transverse integral aﬃne structure Λ on a foliation
(M, F ), its holonomies are related to the F -holonomy through the following com-
mutative diagrams:

hlin

/ GLΛ(ν(F ))

hAff

/ Aﬀ Λ(ν(F ))

(0,hollin)

Mon(M, F )

In particular, the F -holonomy sits inside both the linear and the aﬃne holonomy,
and Hol(M, F ) sits as an immersed subgroupoid:

j : Hol(M, F ) ֒→ Πlin

1 (M, Λ),

(0, j) : Hol(M, F ) ֒→ ΠAﬀ

1 (M, Λ).

Proof. For the commutativity of the ﬁrst diagram it suﬃces to check that the ﬂat
connection ∇ on ν(F ), whose parallel transport gives rise to hlin, when computed
on vectors tangent to F , becomes the Bott F -connection, whose parallel transport
gives rise to hollin. In other words, that we have:

∇V (X) = [V, X],

∀ V ∈ Γ(F ), X ∈ Γ(ν(F )).

This is a local statement that follows right away using local vector ﬁelds X 1, . . . , X q
spanning the integral lattice and such that [V, X i] ∈ Γ(F ) whenever V ∈ Γ(F ).

The commutativity of the second diagram follows from the ﬁrst one and the
remark that the developing map dev : Π1(M ) → ν(F ) vanishes on the image of i∗.
To prove the remark observe that the projection T M → ν(F ), an algebroid 1-cocyle
whose integration is dev, is zero on the sub-algebroid F ⊂ T M ; hence hAﬀ ◦ i∗, as
a groupoid cocycle integrating the zero algebroid cocycle, must be trivial.
(cid:3)

B.2. Lifting to the linear holonomy cover. As in Section 5.1, one can be more
concrete by ﬁxing

• a base point x ∈ M , and
• a Z-basis bΛ = {λ1, . . . , λq} for Λx.

Then one can represent the F -holonomy at x as a map
hollin|x : π1(S, x) → GLZ(Rq),

and similarly for the holonomies of Λ, hlin|x and hAﬀ |x, deﬁned on π1(M, x) (see
(5.1)). The diagrams in Proposition B.1.2 become the following diagrams:

π1(L, x)

The images of hlin|x and hAﬀ |x will be denoted by

Γlin ⊂ GLZ(Rq), ΓAﬀ ⊂ Aﬀ Z(Rq),

respectively. These groups, being quotients of π1(M, x), give rise to a sequence of
covering spaces endowed with pull-back foliations:

(fM , eF )

/ (M Aﬀ , F Aﬀ )

/ (M lin, F lin)

/ (M, F )

Each of these foliations has a (pull-back) transverse integral aﬃne structure. Using
the base point x, we can identify each of these spaces with the source ﬁber at x of
the corresponding groupoids:

fM = Π1(M )(x, −), M Aﬀ = ΠAﬀ

Remark B.2.1. One can also use the basis bΛ to obtain a more concrete model
for M lin, as the connected component through (x, bΛ) of the Λ-frame bundle:

1 (M, Λ)(x, −), M lin = Πlin

1 (M, Λ)(x, −).

Fr(ν(F ), Λ) := {(x, v1, . . . , vq) : x ∈ M, v1, . . . , vq − basis of Λx} ⊂ Fr(ν(F )).

We will not use this description in what follows, but it provides some geometric
insight into the linear holonomy cover and actions on them. Incidentally, it also
shows that Πlin

1 (M ) is the unit connected component of GLΛ(ν(F )).

Next, we state the main properties of the foliation (M lin, F lin). An entirely

similar result holds for (M Aﬀ , F Aﬀ ), but we leave the details to the reader.

Lemma B.2.2. If p : M lin → M is the covering projection, then the foliation
(M lin, F lin) has the following properties:

(i) it has trivial F -holonomy;
(ii) the action of Γlin on M lin takes leaves to leaves;
(iii) each leaf L′ of F lin is isomorphic to the F -holonomy cover of a leaf L of F ,

with covering projection the restriction of p : M lin → M ;

(iv) there is a free, possibly non-proper, action of Hol(M, F ) ⇒ M on M lin → M
and Hol(M lin, F lin) ⇒ M lin is isomorphic to the resulting action groupoid
Hol(M, F ) ⋉ M lin ⇒ M lin;

Proof. Property (i) should be clear since the transverse integral aﬃne structure p∗Λ
on (M lin, F lin) has linear holonomy map the composition of the linear holonomy
map of Λ on (M, F ) with p∗ : π1(M lin) → π1(M ). Using Proposition B.1.2, we
conclude that (M lin, F lin) must have trivial holonomy.

Property (ii) follows from general properties of covers and pullback foliations.

For the proof of property (iii), we consider the s-ﬁber Πlin

1 (x, −) above x, together

with the target map

p : Πlin

1 (x, −) → M,

as a model for the covering p : M lin → M . From the homotopy exact sequence of
the Γlin-cover p : M lin → M , we obtain the following short exact sequence:

0

/ π1(M lin)

/ π1(M ) hlin

/ Γlin

/ 0 .

For any embedded sub-manifold L ⊂ M and for any connected component L′
of p−1(L), the restriction p|L′ : L′ → L is a covering projection with group the
image of i∗(π1(L)) by hlin.
In particular, π1(L′) is isomorphic to the kernel of
the composition hlin ◦ i∗ which equals the linear holonomy group of (M, F ) by
Proposition B.1.2. This proves (iii) in the case where the leaves are embedded.
With some care, the argument can be adapted to immersed leaves L ⊂ M . An
alternative proof of (iii) follows also from the proof of (iv), to which we now turn.
In the model above, the action of Hol(M, F ) on M lin is induced from the inclusion
(see Proposition B.1.2): this clearly gives a free, left, action

j : Hol(M, F ) ֒→ Πlin
1

Hol(M, F ) × Πlin

1 (x, −) → Πlin
The orbit of the action through any γ ∈ Πlin
Rγ : Hol(M, F )(x′, −) → Πlin

(a, γ) 7→ j(a)γ.

1 (x, −),
1 (x, −) is the image of the immersion:
1 (x, −), Rγ(a) = j(a)γ.

We claim that the tangent space at γ to such an orbit coincides with TγF lin. Since
these orbits are smooth, connected, immersed submanifolds of M lin = Πlin
1 (x, −), it
will follow that they are precisely the leaves of F lin. To prove the claim we compute

(dp)(dRγ (Ta Hol(M, F )(x′, −))) = (dt)γ(Tγ Hol(M, F )(x, −)) = Tt(a)F .

This shows that dRγ(Ta Hol(M, F )(x′, −)) ⊂ Tj(γ)aF lin; by a dimension counting,
this inclusion must be an equality, proving the claim. Therefore Hol(M, F ) ⋉ M lin
is a groupoid over M lin integrating F lin, so it comes with a groupoid submersion

Hol(M, F ) ⋉ M lin → Hol(M lin, F lin).

Composing this map with the anchor (s, t) : Hol(M lin, F lin) → M lin×M lin gives the
anchor (s, t) : Hol(M, F ) ⋉ M lin → M lin × M lin, which is injective by freeness of the
action. Therefore the submersion is actually a diﬀeomorphism and (iv) follows. (cid:3)

B.3. Proper Foliations: a Molino type Theorem. In the proper case we have:

Lemma B.3.1. If (M, F ) is a proper foliation with a transverse integral aﬃne
structure then the immersions Hol(M, F ) ֒→ GL(ν(F )), Hol(M, F ) ֒→ Πlin
1 (M )
and Hol(M, F ) ֒→ ΠAﬀ

1 (M ) are embeddings of Lie groupoids.

Proof. By Proposition 2.4.2, the properness of (M, F ) implies that Hol(M, F ) is
a proper groupoid. It then suﬃces to remark that if H is a proper groupoid and
F : H → G is a morphism of Lie groupoids over M covering the identity on the
base, then F is automatically a proper map: for K ⊂ G compact, F −1(K) is closed
inside the compact H(s(K), t(K))), hence it must be compact. In particular, if F
is an injective immersion, than it is automatically a closed embedding.
(cid:3)

As explained in Example 3.2.6, under the present assumptions, B = M/F is an

integral aﬃne orbifold. Our ﬁnal result shows that B is actually a good orbifold:

Theorem B.3.2. If (M, F ) is a foliation of proper type with a transverse integral
aﬃne structure, then the linear holonomy cover (M lin, F lin) is simple and carries
a transverse integral aﬃne structure. Hence, its space of leaves

Blin := M lin/F lin

is a smooth integral aﬃne manifold. Moreover, the action of Γlin on M lin descends
to a proper action on Blin by integral aﬃne transformations and M lin yields a
Morita equivalence:

Blin

In particular, we have an isomorphism of integral aﬃne orbifolds:

M/F ∼= Blin/Γlin.

Proof. By Lemma B.2.2 (iv), the holonomy groupoid of (M lin, F lin) is proper and
this foliation has trivial holonomy. Hence, it must be a simple foliation with smooth
orbit space Blin. Equivalently, now the free action of Hol(M, F ) on M lin is also
proper, hence Blin = M lin/ Hol(M, F ) is smooth and q : M lin → Blin is a principal
Hol(M, F )-bundle. By Lemma B.2.2 (ii) we have an action of Γlin on Blin and
p : M lin → M is a principal Blin ⋊ Γlin-bundle.

The two actions on M lin clearly commute, hence we obtain a Morita equiva-
lence. Since properness is a Morita invariant, it follows that the action of Γlin on
Blin must be proper. The properties concerning the integral aﬃne structure are
straightforward.
(cid:3)

Remark B.3.3. There is a version of the previous theorem where the linear ho-
lonomy cover M lin is replaced by the aﬃne holonomy cover M Aﬀ, giving rise to
a similar Morita equivalence of Hol(M, F ) ⇒ M with BAﬀ ⋊ ΓAﬀ ⇒ BAﬀ . Here
BAﬀ is the aﬃne holonomy cover of the integral aﬃne manifold Blin. This version
allows us to view the developing map dev : M Aﬀ → Rq as the composition of the
projection M Aﬀ → BAﬀ with the developing map dev : BAﬀ → Rq of the integral
aﬃne manifold B. The argument uses the aﬃne version of Lemma B.2.2.

Since a classical integral aﬃne orbifold can always be obtained as the leaf space
of a foliation of proper type with a transverse integral aﬃne structure, we conclude:

Corollary B.3.4. Any classical integral aﬃne orbifold is a good orbifold.
