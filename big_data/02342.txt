We present and expand the simplest possible quantum cosmological model already dis-
cussed in Ref. 1: the trajectory formulation of quantum mechanics applied to cosmology
in the FLRW minisuperspace without spatial curvature. The initial conditions that were
assumed there were such that the wave function would not change its functional form but
instead provide a dynamics to its parameters. Here, we consider a more general situation,
in practice consisting of modiﬁed Gaussian wave functions, aiming at obtaining a bounce
from a contracting phase. Whereas previous works consistently obtain very symmetric
bounces, we ﬁnd that it is possible to produce highly non symmetric solutions, and even
cases for which multiple bounces naturally occur. We also introduce a means of treating
the shear in this category of models by quantizing in the Bianchi I minisuperpace.

1. Introduction

Although recent accumulation of data2 seem to favor the standard3 inﬂationary
paradigm4 with primordial perturbations originating from quantum vacuum ﬂuctu-
ations,5 a few riddles still need solutions, among which the presence of a primordial
singularity.6 It is often hoped, but never proven, that quantum gravitational eﬀects
should take care of this problem, and indeed, many proposals have been made in
this direction,7–9 although not always successfully.10, 11

Treating the Universe itself as a quantum object immediately raises the question
of both the meaning of the wave function Ψ and the issue of measurement. Indeed,
whereas a tabletop experiment leads to a simple interpretation of |Ψ|2 as the prob-
ability to measure whatever it is one wants to measure, when one is dealing with
the wave function of the Universe, such an interpretation becomes instantly slightly
more obscure. Moreover, what is it exactly that one measures in quantum cosmol-
ogy that would collapse the wave function in the eigenvalue of? Such questions
have been the subject of long debates, including possibilities to modify quantum
mechanics itself by inclusion of non linear and stochastic terms in a new version of

the Schr¨odinger equation.12, 13

Similarly using a quantum cosmological framework in which the usual quan-
tum mechanics is modiﬁed, in Ref. 1, a plausible solution to all questions and
issues above was shown to possibly stem from assuming an actual (quantum) mo-
tion14–16 of the scale factor a for quantum cosmology expressed in the Friedmann-
Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) minisuperspace: quantizing a barotropic ﬂuid
along with the gravitational ﬁeld, one obtains a well-deﬁned time variablea T en-
titling to rewrite the Wheeler-De Witt equation in a Schr¨odinger form to which
a de Broglie-Bohm (dBB) trajectory a(T ) can then assigned. With either dust or
radiation, and with arbitrary spatial curvature, one sees that for a given initial (es-
sentially gaussian) wave function, the resulting trajectory never goes through a = 0,
and hence that no singularity is ever reached: a bounce instead takes place.19

In what follows, we present an extension of this resultb aiming at generalizing
the initial condition wave function Ψ0 given at an arbitrary time: in the previous
work,1 the initial wave function that were used had been chosen in such a way
that the only eﬀect of the time evolution was to give a time dependency on the
parameters without modifying their functional forms. For example, for a Gaussian
initial condition, the time evolution just modiﬁes the variance, adding a complex
value to it. Here we assume more general initial wave packets for which this simple
behavior does not hold.

To simplify matters, we restrict attention to ﬂat spatial curvature (although in
full generality this component should be included) but allow for the presence of
shear and thus start with the Bianchi I Hamiltonian.21 Splitting the wave function
into a function of the scale factor only and a shear component eigenmode, we then
reduce our system to the simplest possible case equivalent to the free particle,
which we then endow with a complex initial wave function. Building the Hilbert
space, we calculate the propagator and subsequently evolve this initial wave function
to derive the necessary equation of motion of the scale factor. We then solve the
dBB trajectory numerically to show that non symmetric bouncing solutions appear
generic in this model. We conclude by discussing the generality of our result and
providing the future investigation directions.

aThis is achieved through a formalism introduced by Schutz17, 18 in which the velocity potential
can be expressed in terms of a ﬁeld T whose canonical conjugate pT appears linearly ine the
Hamiltonian, thus providing the basis for a time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation.
bAnother extension was presented in Ref. 20 with a diﬀerent goal related with the initial probability
of a large Universe

Our starting point will be the Hamiltonian discussed in Ref. 21 obtained to study

with matter consisting in a radiation ﬂuid with equation of state w ≡ p/ρ = 1
3 .
In full generality, one could choose any value for w, leaving, as we will see below,
the time parameter unﬁxed, but here we assume that we are considering extremely
early stages of the Universe during which, if a ﬂuid description is to make any sense
at all (and that it questionable indeed), it will have to be a radiation ﬂuid; setting
w = 1
3 is therefore, in our view, not restricting to a particular case but merely a
physically motivated statement.

In the framework above, one sees that the relevant Hamiltonian, assuming the

choice N → a, reads

below) satisfying the usual canonical commutation relations [ˆa, ˆΠa] = [ ˆβ±, ˆp±] = i

In order to move ahead, we ﬁrst rescale the variables in such a way that they retain

their commutation relations and thus perform the replacements a → a/(2√6) and
Πa → 2√6Πa, leading to

which has to be compared with the usual FLRW case with no restriction on the
spatial curvature K for which the last term is proportional to Kˆa2 (the diﬀerence,
quartic in the scale factor, is the same that holds between the curvature and shear
terms appearing in the classical Friedman equation in which the curvature terms is

merely K/a2 while the shear energy density is ∝ a−6; see Ref. 19) and references

therein.

We now work in a mixed representation for the wave function in which the
operators ˆa and ˆp± are merely multiplying operators, i.e., ˆaΨ = aΨ and ˆp±Ψ = p±Ψ,
so that the conjugate operators read ˆΠa = −i∂/∂a and ˆβ± = i∂/∂p±; this is a

position representation for the scale factor part and the momentum representation
for the shear. Since the average scale factor a is, by construction, a positive quantity,

with the limits of integration deﬁned in (4). As already mentioned above, the set of
normalizable functions is too large and the actual Hilbert space H must be restricted
to those normalizable functions such that the condition above is satisﬁed. We note
that the condition (7) is automatically satisﬁed if the Hamiltonian eigenvectors form

set c+ = 1 and c− = 0, or the opposite c+ = 0 and c− = 1; given the initial wave

A simple bouncing quantum cosmological model

3. Time evolution

As alluded to earlier, the existence of a ﬂuid implies that of a preferred time slicing,
and hence of a natural time parameter t for the Schr¨odinger equation. The most
appropriate choice of the lapse function N (t) in (1) depends on the equation of
state of the ﬂuid, and for a radiation dominated universe, one can set N = a, so the
relevant time is the usual conformal time η, in terms of which the ﬂuid canonical

momentum reads ˆPﬂuid = −i∂η. The evolution U (η, η0) thus satisﬁes

i

∂U
∂η

= ˆHU

=⇒ U (η, η0) = e−i(η−η0) ˆH ,

(11)

with η0 an arbitrary initial time. Anticipating on the dBB trajectory, we note that,
contrary to previous work, we do not intend here to impose initial condition at the
expected bounce time at which da/dη = 0, assuming such a time to exist, but we
will instead demand arbitrary initial condition in a contracting stage da/dη < 0
and actually evolve the universe until it bounces (again anticipating that it will do
so).

3.1. Propagator

Our ultimate goal is, starting from an arbitrary initial wave function Ψ0(a) =
Ψ(a; η0), to follow its time development Ψ(a; η), whose phase S(a; η) provides the
dBB trajectory through

pected, we see that if one starts with an eigenstate of ˆp±, the subsequent time
evolution remains on this state. For now on, we shall therefore discard the shear
contribution insofar as it does not contribute to the equation of motion; we therefore
simply denote the propagator by G(a, a(cid:48); η) in what follows.

to evolve the wave functions. As expected, the wave form changes dramatically during the time
evolution, as in particular the mode, depending on its initial localization and spread, eventually
reaches the potential wall at a = 0 at which point the wave function bounces oﬀ. Oscillations then
appear, due to the reﬂection on the wall, inducing a signiﬁcant change in the subsequent time
evolution; these changes are responsible, as we show below, for the completely new behavior of the

function (16) peaks at aini = √2ασ (maximum of
|Ψ0|2), has a mean

is essentially given by α while the spread mostly stems from the value of σ. Finally,
applying (12) to the initial Ψ0 (16), one ﬁnds that the coeﬃcient Hini actually rep-
resents the initial value of the conformal Hubble parameter, hence the name of the
parameter.

which, although it happens to be explicitly integrable in terms of hypergeometric
functions, is not particularly illuminating. Figure 1 also shows the typical time
evolution (17) for the modulus of the wave function. This evolution clearly diﬀers
form that of Ref. 1 where it would hold its shape at all time with time-dependent
parameters. Here, one sees that the boundary condition at a = 0 acts as an inﬁnite
potential wall such that, when the wave function evolves towards it, it bounces
oﬀ, thereby inducing subsequent oscillations that can change dramatically the dBB
trajectories, as we now discuss.

4. Results: from Bianchi I to FLRW

Let us move on to the results, and for the purpose of exemplifying, concentrate on
the shearless limit whereby ν → 1
2 . The full analysis of the Bianchi I case will be
provided elsewhere,23 and for the purpose of this work, we will make contact with
Ref. 1 by going to the vanishing shear limit for which k = 0, and hence ν = 1

0 =⇒ (c− = 1, c+ = 0) and αBC → ∞ =⇒ (c− = 0, c+ = 1), as already mentioned.
The Hamiltonian reduces to that of a free particle on the half-line with the point
a = 0 equivalent to an inﬁnite potential wall. In our ﬁnal result (17), the Bessel
function then reduces to a hyperbolic sine of its argument, so that most calculations
are analytically tractable. We shall not go along this direction here23 and instead
concentrate on a numerical evaluation of the dBB trajectories, comparing those
with previous calculations.

A simple bouncing quantum cosmological model

9

This family of solution has very simple properties: ﬁrst, as expected from a quantum
gravity framework, they solve the singularity problem (what would be the point to
have a quantum gravity model with singularities?) in the sense that the contracting
phase never reaches the singular point a = 0 since the minimum scale factor aB > 0
unless one sets aB = 0 in the ﬁrst place, in which case the solution is singular at all
times and thus lacks any physical relevance.

A second conclusion that can be drawn from (18) is that there is one and only
one bounce taking place, with a regular decrease of the scale factor followed by a
simple bounce and a subsequent regular increase. In a sense, this is the simplest
extension of the standard cosmological model that can be though of. Finally, and
this is possibly the most crucial point, the bounces induced by (18) are all symmetric
in time.

Figure 2 shows various solutions assuming diﬀerent values for the initial scale
factor and conformal Hubble parameter, for the cases depicted on Fig. 1. It is
apparent that the very simple solution of Ref. 1, is merely an exceptional case. In
the cases studied here, we ﬁnd that not only is the bounce often non symmetric in
time, but also that many bounces can naturally occur, and in a way which is quite
sensitive to the initial condition one sets on aini and Hini.
Our study opens a wide range of new studies that need now be done for a com-
plete understanding of such bouncing scenarios. First, the case with non vanishing
shear must be investigated in details, with particular emphasis on the so-called BKL
instability (see again Ref. 19 for a thorough discussion of bounce models and their
problems) according to which a pre-existing shear can spontaneously lead to many
new Kasner-like singularities.

The second point that should be examined in details concerns the propagation
of perturbations through such a complicated bounce. In models such as those based
on dBB trajectories, it was found that perturbations can be easily evaluated in a
way reminiscent the ordinary perturbation theory based on general relativity, but
with the scale factor replaced by that obtained along the dBB trajectory.24–26 With
characteristic solutions exhibiting such features as shown on Fig. 2, it is clear that
the potential for the perturbations will have many new interesting consequences
that we hope to clarify in a further extension of the current work.
