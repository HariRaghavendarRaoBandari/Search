ABSTRACT
Radio relics are Mpc-scale diﬀuse radio sources at the peripheries of galaxy clusters
which are thought to trace outgoing merger shocks. We present XMM-Newton and
Suzaku observations of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 (z = 0.306), which reveal the
presence of a shock front 1.5 Mpc East of the cluster core. The surface-brightness jump
coincides with the position of a known radio relic. Although the surface-brightness
jump indicates a weak shock with a Mach number M = 1.7+0.5−0.3, the plasma in the
post-shock region has been heated to a very high temperature (∼ 13 keV) by the
passage of the shock wave. The low acceleration eﬃciency expected from such a weak
shock suggests that mildly relativistic electrons have been re-accelerated by the passage
of the shock front.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the standard hierarchical structure formation scenario,
galaxy clusters are expected to form through subsequent
mergers of smaller entities. In this process, the plasma con-
tained within the merging subclusters collides, launching
Mpc-scale shock waves with Mach numbers in the range
1.5-3 which contribute to the thermalization of the plasma
(e.g. Miniati et al. 2001; Ryu et al. 2003). This picture has
received increasing observational support lately thanks to
the discovery of shock fronts in a handful of merging clus-
ters (Markevitch et al. 2002, 2005; Owers et al. 2011, 2014;
Russell et al. 2010). Additionally, merger shocks are also
expected to (re-)accelerate particles through diﬀusive shock
acceleration (DSA, e.g. Ensslin et al. 1998; Hoeft et al. 2008;
Kang & Ryu 2013). This phenomenon is thought to give rise
to radio relics, i.e. irregular, diﬀuse, steep-spectrum radio
sources at the periphery of merging clusters (e.g. Rottgering
et al. 1997; van Weeren et al. 2010; Bonafede et al. 2012).

While in a few cases a shock front has been found co-

incident with a radio relic (Finoguenov et al. 2010; Ogrean
et al. 2013a), X-ray observations tend to prefer lower Mach
numbers compared to the values expected from DSA based
on the radio spectrum (Akamatsu & Kawahara 2013; Ogrean
et al. 2013b; van Weeren et al. 2016). Some X-ray-detected
shock fronts are not associated with radio emission (Abell
2146, Russell et al. 2011), and the acceleration eﬃciency of
electrons and protons diﬀers from that expected from DSA
(Vazza & Br¨uggen 2014; Vazza et al. 2015). Therefore, while
there is usually a connection between shock fronts and ra-
dio relics, diﬀerent systems provide contradicting results and
the acceleration mechanism is still poorly understood.

Abell 2744 (hereafter A2744) is a massive cluster
(M200 ∼ 2 × 1015M(cid:12), Medezinski et al. 2016) at a redshift
of 0.306 (Owers et al. 2011). It is located at the crossroads
of several ﬁlaments (Eckert et al. 2015) and it is experi-
encing a merger of at least four individual entities. Radio
observations of this system have reported the presence of a
central radio halo and also of a peripheral radio relic of size
1.6 × 0.3 Mpc located roughly 1.5 Mpc East of the cluster
core (Govoni et al. 2001).

associated with the radio relic of A2744. The paper is orga-
nized as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the available X-ray
data and the analysis procedure. Our results are presented
in Sect. 3 and discussed in Sect. 4. At the redshift of A2744,
the standard ΛCDM cosmology corresponds to 1(cid:48)(cid:48) = 4.5 kpc.
The uncertainties are given at the 1σ level.

2 DATA

2.1 XMM-Newton

A2744 was observed by XMM-Newton on December 18-20,
2014 for a total of 110 ks (OBSID 074385010, PI: Kneib).
We analyzed the data using the XMMSAS software pack-
age v13.5 and the ESAS data analysis scheme (Snowden
et al. 2008). After cleaning the event ﬁles by excluding the
time periods aﬀected by soft proton ﬂares, we obtain 96
ks (MOS1), 97 ks (MOS2), and 87 ks (PN) of good data.
We extracted a count image in the [0.5-1.2] keV band and
computed the corresponding exposure map to correct for
vignetting eﬀects. A model for the particle background was
created from a large collection of ﬁlter-wheel-closed observa-
tions which were then rescaled to match the particle back-
ground count rate in the A2744 observation. This dataset
was presented in Eckert et al. (2015) and Jauzac et al.
(subm.). For more details on the analysis procedure, we refer
the reader to these papers.

2.2 Suzaku

The NE ﬁeld of A2744 around the radio relic was targeted by
Suzaku on November 20-22, 2013 for a total of 70 ks (OBSID
808008010). A three-pointing mosaic of the outer regions of
A2744 also exists in the archive and was presented by Ibaraki
et al. (2014). For the purpose of this study we only focus on
the NE pointing. We analyzed this observation using the
Suzaku FTOOLS v6.17 and the corresponding calibration
database. We reprocessed the data using the aepipeline
tool, ﬁltering out the time periods when the geomagnetic
cut-oﬀ rigidity was < 6 GeV. We extracted spectra from the
three XIS chips in the relic region and in a background re-
gion located 12.5 arcmin NE of the cluster core, where no
cluster emission is detected. We used the xisnxbgen tool to
extract model particle background spectra from dark-Earth
data. The particle background spectra were ﬁt using a phe-
nomenological model and added to the global spectral model
to preserve the statistical properties of the data, following
the approach presented in De Grandi et al. (2016).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Surface-brightness proﬁle

In the left-hand panel of Fig. 1 we show the co-added XMM-
Newton/EPIC image of A2744 in the [0.5-1.2] keV band
centered on the radio relic. The image was corrected for vi-
gnetting and the model particle background was subtracted.
The resulting image was then adaptively smoothed using
the XMMSAS task asmooth. For comparison, we also show
GMRT radio contours at 330 MHz (Mulcahy et al. in prep.).

A sharp drop in X-ray surface brightness can be observed
beyond the eastern edge of the relic.

To conﬁrm this statement, we used Proffit v.1.3 (Eck-
ert et al. 2011) to measure the brightness proﬁle across the
relic in the sector displayed in green in Fig. 1. The resulting
surface-brightness proﬁle is shown in the right-hand panel of
Fig. 1. A ﬂat proﬁle is observed inside the relic, followed by
a sharp decline in the measured surface brightness. This be-
haviour is characteristic of a density discontinuity. Thus, we
ﬁtted the surface-brightness proﬁle with a broken power-law
model projected along the line of sight and convolved with
the PSF of XMM-Newton. The best-ﬁt model is displayed
in the right-hand panel of Fig. 1, conﬁrming the presence of
a brightness jump coincident with the eastern edge of the
radio relic. The model provides an accurate description of
the data (χ2 = 4.7 for 10 d.o.f.) and yields a signiﬁcant im-
provement compared to a single power-law ﬁt (χ2 = 26.9
for 13 d.o.f.), which according to the F-test corresponds to
a null-hypothesis probability of 4 × 10−4 (3.6σ level). The
best-ﬁt model returns density slopes αin = 0.1 ± 0.3 and
αout = 1.7 ± 0.7 inside and outside the relic, respectively.
The density jump at the front is nin/nout = 1.9+0.6−0.4. This
analysis demonstrates that a density discontinuity is present,
coincident with the eastern edge of the radio relic.

3.2 Spectral properties

We extracted spectra in the relic region from both XMM-
Newton and Suzaku data to investigate the thermodynamic
properties of the plasma inside the density discontinuity.
The corresponding region is shown in the left-hand panel
of Fig. 1. In both cases, we used oﬀset regions to esti-
mate the background parameters. To model the background
spectrum, we followed the approach presented in Eckert
et al. (2014). The background spectrum was ﬁt with a 4-
component model including a phenomenological model for
the particle background, a power law for the cosmic X-
ray background and two APEC thin-plasma models for the
Galactic halo and the local hot bubble. Spectral ﬁtting was
performed using XSPEC v12.9 and the C-statistic estimator.
The background spectrum was extracted from four diﬀerent
oﬀset regions in the ﬁeld and no variation in the background
parameters was found across the ﬁeld of view (see Eckert
et al. 2015, for a detailed description of the background
model in the region of A2744). To model the spectrum of
the relic region, the normalization of the sky background
parameters was renormalized by the ratio of the area of
the source region to that of the background region. Con-
versely, the normalization of the particle background model
was left free while ﬁtting. The source itself was modeled with
a single-temperature APEC model absorbed by the Galac-
tic NH (1.5 × 1020 cm−2, Kalberla et al. 2005). The metal
abundance was ﬁxed to the canonical value of 0.25Z(cid:12) (Lec-
cardi & Molendi 2008). A similar approach was adopted for
the Suzaku spectra (see De Grandi et al. 2016).

In Fig. 2 we show the spectra of the relic region ex-
tracted with XMM-Newton and Suzaku, together with their
best-ﬁtting model. From the Suzaku data we measured
kT = 12.3+4.5−3.5 keV. This value is consistent with the tem-
perature reported by Ibaraki et al. (2014). The ﬁt to the
XMM-Newton data diverges to very high temperatures well
outside the ﬁtting range. The XMM-Newton data allow us

to set a lower limit of kT > 12.1 keV to the temperature in
the relic region (90% conﬁdence level). Therefore, the two
instruments return consistent results and show that the tem-
perature of the gas in the relic region is very high. For the
remainder of the paper we adopt the Suzaku value because
of its lower particle background.

We also extracted the Suzaku spectrum from the region
just beyond the discontinuity (see Fig. 3). Unfortunately, a
number of relatively bright point sources are present in this
area, which cover a large fraction of the region because of
the broad PSF of Suzaku. We ﬁxed the position of these
point sources to the position measured by XMM-Newton
and excluded circular regions of 1.5 arcmin radius around
the corresponding positions. Fitting the spectrum of the re-
maining region following the same procedure as explained
above, we obtained a temperature kT = 4.6+2.3−1.3. Therefore,
we conclude with high conﬁdence that the density disconti-
nuity shown in Fig. 1 is a shock front with a temperature
jump Tin/Tout = 2.7+1.4−0.9.

An alternative explanation is that a fraction of the
X-ray emission at the radio relic originates from inverse-
Compton scattering of CMB photons with the relativistic
electron population responsible for the radio relic. To test
this possibility, we added an additional power-law compo-
nent to model the Suzaku/XIS spectrum. We ﬁxed the spec-
tral index of the model to the value of 1.1 reported by Orr´u
et al. (2007) in the radio waveband and added the normal-
ization of the power law as a free parameter. Adding this
component yields a very modest improvement in C-statistic
compared to the single APEC model (∆C=0.8) and the nor-
malization of the power-law component is consistent with 0.
We thus conclude that a strong non-thermal contribution to
the X-ray emission is unlikely.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Mach number

As shown in Fig. 1, we detect a surface-brightness edge
at the position of the radio relic, which can be modeled
with a projected broken power law with a density jump
r = nin/nout = 1.9+0.6−0.4. The density jump at the front
can be related to the Mach number of the moving plasma
through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions (Markevitch
& Vikhlinin 2007),

where γ = 5/3 is the polytropic index. Using the above
formula, we obtain a Mach number Mshock = 1.7+0.5−0.3 at
the front. Radio observations of the radio relic indicate a
spectral index of α = 1.1± 0.1 at the radio relic (Orr´u et al.
2007), which from the standard DSA formula,

Mradio =

, with p = 2α + 1,

(2)
translates into a Mach number Mradio = 2.1 ± 0.1, in
agreement with the Mach number derived from the shock
front, albeit slightly higher. Note however that this calcu-
lation assumes that all the electrons are freshly accelerated
and neglects cooling losses. Indeed, Orr´u et al. (2007) report
a steepening of the radio spectral index from ∼ 0.9 at the
front to ∼ 1.5 at the western edge. Thus, the actual spectral
index at the front is likely ﬂatter than the value α = 1.1
reported by Orr´u et al. (2007), corresponding to a higher
Mach number. Higher-resolution radio observations are re-
quired to test the consistency between the Mach number
inferred from the X-ray shock and that expected from DSA
theory.

(XIS0+XIS3) are shown, however the ﬁts were performed simultaneously on all available chips.

4.2 Clues on electron acceleration eﬃciency

The combination of X-ray and radio observations of A2744
allows us to test the DSA model for the origin of the ra-
dio relic. We follow the same approach outlined in Vazza
& Br¨uggen (2014), which makes it possible to constrain the
acceleration eﬃciency of electrons at the shock to match
the observed radio power. Given the relic parameters (i.e.
the size and distance of the relic, the radio spectrum) and
the gas density and temperature at the relic, we can esti-
mate the kinetic energy ﬂux across the shock and also how
much energy should be dissipated into relativistic electrons
to match the observed radio power.

We ﬁx the post-shock gas temperature to 12 keV, while
the pre-shock is derived from the shock jump conditions for
the Mach numbers inferred by the X-ray (M ≈ 1.7) and the
radio (M ≈ 2.1). The gas density at the relic location is the
extrapolation of the β-model solution for A2744 at the relic
position, and we add the density jump of the shock. For the
magnetic ﬁeld, we use the range of values derived by Orr´u
et al. (2007) under the hypothesis of equipartition between
cosmic ray electrons and magnetic ﬁelds, B ≈ 0.6 − 1.1µG.
Table 4.2 shows the list of values we investigated for this
test. The last two columns show the electron acceleration
eﬃciency, ξe, we derive from the data and the correspond-
ing value predicted by DSA. In the last case, we used the
proton acceleration eﬃciency derived by the DSA model by
Kang & Ryu (2013), rescaled for an electron to proton in-
jection ratio Kep = 0.01, which is at the high end of what
is assumed in DSA. The comparison clearly shows that the
required electron acceleration eﬃciency for the weak shock
in A2744 is from 10 to 103 times higher than predicted by
DSA. Therefore, the single injection model is inconsistent
with our data.

The problem in explaining the radio emission from such
weak shocks has been already addressed in the literature
(Pinzke et al. 2013; Kang et al. 2014; Vazza & Br¨uggen
2014), suggesting that a pool of mildly relativistic electrons
must be already present in the volume, and that it can get

Figure 3. Same as Fig. 2 for the Suzaku spectrum of the pre-
shock region.

The very high temperature measured in the relic region
provides direct evidence of heating of the plasma induced
by the passage of the shock wave. Although the relic is lo-
cated at a rather large projected distance from the cluster
core (∼ 1.5 Mpc), the temperature of the relic region is
higher than in the cluster core. Applying again the Rankine-
Hugoniot jump conditions, one can predict the temperature
jump at the front to lie in the range 1.4 − 2.1, which is
slightly lower (albeit consistent) with the measured temper-
ature jump. Given the sound speed cs = (γkT /µmp)1/2 in
the pre-shock plasma, we estimate the velocity of the shock
wave to be in the range 2, 000 − 2, 800 km/s.

reaccelerated by weak shocks. Given the variety of sources
of relativistic electrons in the ICM (e.g. previous cluster
shocks, supernovae, radio galaxies etc) this scenario is en-
ergetically viable. For example, the evidence of a physical
connection between a peripheral radio relic and the lobes of
a radio galaxy has been recently discussed by Bonafede et al.
(2014). The robust measure of the shock Mach number and
the fact that the relic is so peripheral makes other alternative
scenarios (i.e. a much higher magnetic ﬁeld or Mach num-
ber) very unlikely. However, the shock re-acceleration sce-
nario also faces non-trivial problems, because unless the pre-
existing electrons are the product of a leptonic-dominated
acceleration mechanism (Kep ≥ 0.1), shocks would also reac-
celerate protons and cause γ-ray emission in excess of Fermi
limits (e.g. Vazza et al. 2015).

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this Letter, we have reported the discovery of a density
jump by a factor of ∼ 1.9 associated with the eastern edge
of the radio relic of A2744. The temperature of the gas co-
incident with the radio relic is very high (∼ 12 keV), which
indicates a heating of the plasma by the passage of a shock
front. Our data imply a Mach number of 1.7+0.5−0.3 at the front.
This value agrees with the temperature jump and with the
Mach number of 2.1 expected from the spectral index of the
radio relic (Orr´u et al. 2007), although this estimate assumes
that all electrons are freshly accelerated. The high temper-
ature of the plasma in the post-shock region provides clear
evidence for simultaneous heating and particle acceleration
by merger-induced shock waves. The acceleration eﬃciency
implied by DSA is insuﬃcient to explain the observed radio
power, which suggests that pre-existing mildly-relativistic
electrons have been re-accelerated at the shock front. Fi-
nally, we note that the shock front reported here should be
an excellent target for the new generation of high-resolution
Sunyaev-Zeldovich cameras (e.g. NIKA2), which could allow
us to detect the associated pressure jump directly.
