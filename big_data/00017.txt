Topological Weyl semimetals, besides manifesting chiral anomaly, can also accommodate a
disorder-driven unconventional quantum phase transition into a diﬀusive metallic phase. A fun-
damentally and practically important question in this regard concerns an experimentally measur-
able quantity that can clearly distinguish these two phases. We show that the optical conductivity
while serving this purpose can also play the role of a bonaﬁde order parameter across such disorder-
driven semimetal-metal quantum phase transition by virtue of displaying distinct scaling behavior in
semimetallic and metallic phases, as well as inside the quantum critical fan supporting a non-Fermi
liquid. We demonstrate that the correction to dielectric constant and optical conductivity in a dirty
Weyl semimetal due to weak disorder is independent of the actual nature of point-like impurity
scatterers. Therefore, optical conductivity can be used as an experimentally measurable quantity to
study the critical properties and to pin the universality class of the disorder-driven quantum phase
transition in Weyl semimetals.

Introduction: Understanding and characterizing phase
transitions is one of the most important problems in con-
densed matter physics. Identiﬁcation of distinct phases
of matter and the possible phase transitions among them
necessarily rely on the existence of a physical quantity
that behaves diﬀerently in two phases and as such can
potentially serve as a bonaﬁde order parameter (OP)
across the transition. The notion of an OP is as ger-
mane near a zero-temperature quantum phase transi-
tion (QPT), driven by quantum ﬂuctuations, as near
the ﬁnite-temperature classical phase transition, where
thermal ﬂuctuations dominate [1, 2]. With increas-
ing complexity of various phases, the horizon of OPs
has expanded enormously, and topological OPs, which
globally characterize a phase of matter, have recently
emerged [3, 4]. Moreover, the landscape of topolog-
ical states has been extended to gapless systems fea-
turing quasiparticles at arbitrarily low energies in the
bulk, with Weyl semimetal (WSM), discovered in various
three-dimensional gapless semiconductors [5–14], stand-
ing as the paradigmatic representative. The constitut-
ing Weyl nodes are topologically protected and act as a
source (monopole) and a sink (anti-monopole) of Berry
ﬂux in the momentum space, manifesting through Adler-
Bell-Jackiw chiral anomaly and surface Fermi arcs [15].
In addition to its topological properties, WSM can also
support a disorder-tuned unconventional QPT toward a
diﬀusive metallic phase at a ﬁnite disorder strength [16–
31], see Fig. 1, and we propose that optical conductiv-
ity (OC) can expose the rich phase diagram of a dirty
WSM at ﬁnite frequencies. Unveiling such novel quan-
tum critical phenomena in real materials, however, nec-
essarily encounters technical diﬃculties. For example,
the average density of states at the Weyl points has

been proposed as a possible OP across such semimetal-
metal QPT [24, 26, 28–30], but its measurement through
compressibility in three-dimensional systems is extremely
challenging, and may become even more complicated
due to unwanted but likely presence of charged pud-
dles [32, 33], Lifshitz tail and rare region eﬀects [34] in
vicinity of the Weyl nodes, as well as due to pinning of the
Fermi energy away from the Weyl points. These mecha-
nisms can musk the WSM-metal quantum critical point
(QCP) [32, 33] or perhaps even convert it into a hidden
QCP [34], therefore demanding the search of a measur-
able quantity that can unearth the underlying QCP by
exposing the wide quantum-critical regime away from the
pristine QCP. While its inter-band component is capable
of bypassing these barriers, we show here that the OC can
also display a single parameter scaling across the WSM-
metal QPT, thus being suitable as a promising candidate
for an experimentally viable OP in a dirty WSM.

We establish that while the OC vanishes linearly with
frequency (Ω) in a clean WSM, weak disorder leads to
a nontrivial but universal (up to a sign) correction,
irrespective of the actual nature of elastic scatterers.
Thus both clean and weakly disordered WSMs behave
as power-law insulators.
It is worth mentioning that
OC (σ) has been experimentally measured in the three-
dimensional materials featuring linearly dispersing quasi-
particles in the bulk, suggesting that σ(Ω) ∼ Ω [35–
37]. On the other hand,
in the metallic phase the
zero-frequency OC becomes ﬁnite, displaying a universal
power-law dependence on disorder strength (measured
from the critical one), set by the correlation length ex-
ponent (ν). Inside the quantum critical regime, consti-
tuted by disorder-induced strongly coupled gapless crit-
ical modes supporting a non-Fermi liquid, the OC van-

Disorder: Eﬀects of randomness are captured by the

VN (x) assumes a Gaussian white noise distribution, with
disorder average (cid:104)(cid:104)VN (x)VN (x(cid:48))(cid:105)(cid:105) = ∆N δ(x − x(cid:48)). As
shown in the SM, various types of disorder can be de-
scribed by an appropriate choice of the 4×4 matrix ˆN and
the scaling dimension of disorder coupling [∆N ] = 2z−d.
The clean WSM features linearly dispersing quasiparti-
cles and is thus characterized by dynamic scaling expo-
nent z = 1. Therefore, any suﬃciently weak disorder is
an irrelevant perturbation (since [∆N ] = −1), and low
energy excitations retain their ballistic nature in WSM.
The fact that weak disorder is an irrelevant pertur-
bation in three-dimensional WSM gives rise to the pos-
sibility of a disorder-driven QPT to a metallic phase
for strong disorder [16–31].
In light of this, we next
show that OC exhibits a single parameter scaling, and
therefore can serve as a bonaﬁde OP across the WSM-
metal QPT. For extremely strong disorder the three-
dimensional metal eventually undergoes the Anderson
transition into an insulating phase [16, 26], which is, how-
ever, outside the scope of the current work.

Scaling: The scaling of conductivity (σ) with the sys-
tem size (L) follows from the gauge invariance, leading to
σ ∼ L2−d. As the system approaches the QCP located at
∆N = ∆∗
N , the correlation length (ξ) diverges according
to ξ ∼ |δ|−ν, while the corresponding energy (0) van-
ishes as 0 ∼ |δ|νz, where δ = (∆N − ∆∗
N measures
the distance from the QCP. Therefore, semimetallic and
metallic phases are respectively realized for ∆N < ∆∗

and ∆N > ∆∗
In the proximity of a QCP, critical

scaling of any physical observable depends on two di-
mensionless parameters L/ξ and Ω/0. These arguments
then lead to the following scaling ansatz for the OC (in
units of e2/h) in a dirty WSM
σ(Ω, δ, L) = L2−dG
where G and F are two unknown, but universal scaling
functions. Although the explicit forms for these scaling
functions are generally unknown and can only be deter-
mined experimentally, their salient features can be de-
duced from the behavior of OC in various phases of a
dirty WSM. Since we are interested in the optical proper-
ties of a WSM in the thermodynamic limit (L → ∞), for
brevity we drop the explicit L-dependence in σ(Ω, δ, L).
First we focus on the QCP (δ = 0), where the OC
must be devoid of any δ-dependence, dictating F(x) ∼
x(d−2)/z. Its scaling with frequency is then given by

aries (black lines), such as the ones between the critical regime

by δ (see text). The optical conductivity inside the Weyl

correlation length exponent (ν) deﬁnes the universality
class of the WSM-metal QPT.

Model : Quintessential properties of a WSM can be

captured by the eﬀective low-energy Hamiltonian

where v is the the Fermi velocity of Weyl fermions, as-
sumed to be isotropic for simplicity, and pj are com-
ponents of momentum. Three mutually anticommuting
matrices are deﬁned as Γj = τ3 ⊗ αj with two sets of
Pauli matrices τ and α respectively acting in the chi-
ral (valley) and spin spaces. The spinor is deﬁned as
Ψ(cid:62)
p = [cp,↑,+, cp,↓,+, cp,↑,−, cp,↓,−], where cp,σ,τ is the
fermion annihilation operator with momentum p, spin
projection α =↑ / ↓, and chirality τ = +/− (left/right).
As shown in the Supplementary Material (SM), the above
low-energy Hamiltonian for WSM can be realized from a

00.20.40.60.8∆(cid:87)E(cid:76)MetalWeylsemimetalCriticalregimeQCP|δ|νz, which in turn roughly determines the extent of the
critical regime at ﬁnite frequencies (see Fig. 1). Notice
that as the QCP is approached from the WSM phase the
residue of quasiparticle pole vanishes smoothly [20], while
approaching it from the metallic side the diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient diverges [24]. Therefore, the critical regime consti-
tutes a non-Fermi liquid phase of strongly coupled gap-
less critical modes, due to quantum ﬂuctuations driven
by disorder, where the OC scales as Ω1/z.

Next we consider the metallic phase, where average
density of states at zero energy is ﬁnite, and thus OC as
Ω → 0 also becomes ﬁnite. Hence, inside the metallic
phase F(x) ∼ x0 (to the leading order) and OC scales as

σ(Ω → 0, δ > 0) ≡ σM (Ω → 0) ∼ δν(d−2).

OC in the metallic phase thus depends only on ν as
Ω → 0, which together with the dependence of σQ(Ω)
solely on z endows a unique opportunity to extract the
correlation length and the dynamic critical exponents
near the WSM-metal QCP independently, and that way
pin the universality class of this transition. Hence, in
the presence of strong disorder (∆N > ∆∗
N ), as the fre-
quency is gradually lowered the intra-band component of
OC starts to dominate over the inter-band counterpart,
and in the limit Ω → 0, only the former contribution
survives. Therefore, in the super-critical regime, OC dis-
plays a smooth crossover from Ω1/z dependence (high
frequency) toward a constant value as Ω → 0 (low fre-
quency) around Ω ∼ δνz [see Fig. 1].

Finally, we delve into the scaling of OC on the WSM
In the clean limit, on dimen-
side of the transition.
sional grounds, we expect inter-band OC σ(Ω) ∼ Ωd−2.
Such scaling of OC remains valid in the weakly disor-
dered WSM, at least when Ω (cid:28) 0,
indicating that
F(x) ∼ xd−2 for δ < 0, leading to

σ(Ω, δ < 0) ≡ σW (Ω) ∼ Ωd−2 |δ|ν(1−z)(d−2),

which vanishes linearly with frequency Ω. With increas-
ing strength of disorder, the system becomes more metal-
lic and typically at the WSM-metal QCP z > 1 [16, 19–
21, 24, 26–30]. Consequently, σW (Ω) increases as one
approaches the WSM-metal QCP from the semimetal-
lic side.
In the weak disorder regime, the inter-band
component of OC dominates over intra-band piece un-
til Ω ∼ EF , with EF being the Fermi energy (typically
unknown) in a WSM, and with increasing frequency OC
displays a smooth crossover from Ω to Ω1/z dependence.
As disorder increases the frequency range over which OC
scales linearly with the frequency shrinks, while the re-
gion with Ω1/z scaling increases. Finally, at the WSM-
metal QCP σ ∼ Ω1/z over the entire range of frequency
[see Fig. 1], at least when Ω (cid:28) vΛ.
Optical response in a WSM : Since weak disorder ﬂows
toward smaller values with increasing RG time l ∼
log(vΛ/Ω) or decreasing frequency, the lowest energy ex-
citations are described by ballistic chiral fermions in a

3

weakly disordered WSM. Thus, we can rely on the Kubo
formalism in this regime to compute OC of a WSM di-
agramatically, and directly test the validity of the scal-
ing ansatz of OC for weak enough randomness. To set
the stage, we ﬁrst focus on the OC in a clean WSM
(∆N = 0), which at zero temperature can be extracted
from the current-current correlation function.
In what
follows and as shown in the SM, we compute the inte-
grals over the internal momentum in d = 3 −  spatial
dimensions, and at the end send  → 0, closely follow-
ing the spirit of dimensional regularization that mani-
festly preserves the gauge invariance [38]. The OC in
a clean WSM is σ(Ω) = (e2Nf Ω)/(6hv) ≡ σ0, with Nf
as the number of Weyl pairs.
In this limit (∆N = 0),
in agreement with the above scaling
σW (Ω) = σ(Ω),
form. Therefore, inter-band component of OC scales lin-
early with the frequency [19, 39, 40], as has been observed
in Nd2(IrxRh1−x)2O7 [35] and Eu2Ir2O7 [37], which pos-
sibly through an “all-in all-out” magnetic ordering in py-
rochlore lattice enter into a WSM phase [41].

By now it is well established that random charge impu-
rities (∆V ) can drive WSM-metal transition [16–31] or at
least can support a large crossover regime if rare regions
dominate at the lowest energy scale [34]. As described
in depth in the SM, elastic scatterer of any other nature
(magnetic, spin-orbit, mass disorder etc.) generates ran-
dom axial chemical potential through quantum correc-
tions. Such axial disorder (∆A) causes random but equal
and opposite shifts of the Fermi level for left and right
chiral fermions, while maintaining the overall charge neu-
trality of the system. Strong axial disorder also gives rise
to semimetal-metal QPT [19, 20, 26, 28]. Hence, to an-
chor the scaling behavior of OC in weak disorder regime,
it is suﬃcient to focus on these two disorder couplings,
∆V and ∆A, respectively characterized by two matrices
ˆN = τ0 ⊗ α0 and ˆN = τ3 ⊗ α0. After accounting for the
correction to OC to the lowest order in disorder coupling
the total OC is given by (see SM for details)

σ(Ω) = σ0

for N = V, A, where ˆ∆N = ∆N Λ/(π2v2) is the di-
mensionless bare disorder strength, and the function
F (x) ≈ 1 − x2 + O(x4). The above form of the OC
σ(Ω) = σ0(1 + ˆ∆N ) is also compatible with the scaling
form of σW (Ω) after substituting z = 3/2, ν = 1, as pre-
dicted from one-loop RG calculation [19–21] and also rea-
sonably consistent with recent numerical works [24, 28–
30], with ˆ∆∗
V /A = 1/2 being the non-universal critical
strength of disorder for the WSM-metal QPT. Such a
striking agreement among scaling theory [see Eq.
(2)
and σW (Ω)], perturbative correction to OC in the weak
disorder limit [see Eq. (3)], RG and numerical analysis
indicates internal consistency of our analysis, and puts
forward OC as a bonaﬁde OP across the unconventional

QPT in WSM to a metallic phase. With one-loop re-
sult for the critical exponents ν and z, OC in the criti-
cal regime σQ(Ω) ∼ Ω2/3 and inside the metallic phase
σM (Ω → 0) ∼ δ. However, as our scaling analysis sug-
gests, these critical exponents can be determined inde-
pendently from the scaling of OC in numerical studies
and experiments to precisely determine the universality
class of the WSM-metal transition.

The imaginary part of OC in a weakly disordered WSM
also receives a correction yielding the total dielectric con-
stant in the presence of the chemical potential (N = V )
or axial disorder (N = A)

which displays a logarithmic enhancement as Ω → 0. It
is worth mentioning that recent experiment has observed
enhancement of ε(Ω) in Eu2Ir2O7 as Ω → 0 [37].

Furthermore, in the presence of arbitrary disorder the
OC in three-dimensional WSM exhibits a remarkably
universal dependence on frequency and disorder, but up
to a sign, depending on the type of elastic scatterer, as
shown in Table I of SM. Correction to OC due to any dis-
order (such as spin-orbit disorder with ∆N = ∆SO and
ˆN = τ2 ⊗ αj) that together with axial disorder changes
the universality class of the WSM-metal QPT [19, 42],
conforms to the critical scaling form, shown in Eq. (3).
Consequently, the dielectric constant also receives a uni-
versal (up to a sign) correction due to disorder that, how-
ever, scales linearly with frequency, as shown in Eq. (4).
Conclusions: We establish OC as an experimentally
accessible OP across the disorder-driven WSM-metal
QPT. In particular, we show that it can uncover signa-
tures of an underlying dirty QCP by exposing the associ-
ated quantum critical regime at ﬁnite frequencies. While
the scaling analysis is performed here strictly at T = 0
in the ballistic (collisionless) regime, it remains opera-
tive also at ﬁnite temperature as long as Ω (cid:29) T [45].
Our scaling arguments can also be applied to the dc con-
ductivity [19, 21, 25] in the collision-dominated regime
T (cid:29) Ω, for which the scaling behavior qualitatively fol-
lows Eq. (2) upon taking Ω → T [45].

Even though we primarily focused on WSMs [5–14],
our results are consequential to a vast number of mate-
rials, such as the topological Dirac semimetal that has
recently been discovered in Cd2As3 [43] and Na3Bi [44],
conventional Dirac semimetals that can be found at the
QCP separating two topologically distinct (strong, weak,
crystalline and trivial) insulating phases in various three-
dimensional strong spin-orbit coupled materials, such
as Bi1−xSbx, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te2, Sb2Te3 [3, 4] and quasi-
crystals supporting Dirac fermions [36]. From the extent
of the critical regime and semimetalic phase at ﬁnite fre-
quencies (see Fig. 1), we expect that the critical scaling
of OC and its correction due to random impurities can be

4

observed in a broad class of disordered Weyl and Dirac
semimetals.

This Supplementary Material contains (i) lattice model for Weyl fermions, (ii) scaling analysis for disorder coupling
in three dimensional Weyl semimetals, (iii) generation of axial disorder from arbitrary disorder through quantum
loop corrections, (iv) calculation of optical properties, such as inter-band part of the optical conductivity, dielectric
constant in clean WSM, (v) corrections to these quantities due to weak randomness in the system, and (vi) some
essential integral identities useful for the calculation of optical conductivity.

• A lattice model of Weyl semimetal: The low energy Hamiltonian for WSM, shown in the main part of the

paper, can be realized from a simple tight-binding model on a cubic lattice

k = [ck,↑, ck,↓] is a two component spinor. The term proportional to t(cid:48) plays
where a is the lattice spacing and Ψ(cid:62)
the role of Wilson mass that turns three pairs of Weyl nodes into massive, except the ones at ±k0, respectively
supporting left and right chiral fermions, where k0 = (1, 1, 1) π
2a . The low energy Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) of main
paper is then obtained by linearizing the above tight binding model near ±k0, with v = ta/, Λ ∼ 1/a is the
ultraviolet cutoﬀ, and momentum (p) is measured from two Weyl nodes.

• Scaling dimension of disorder in WSM: The eﬀects of disorder can be captured from the Euclidean action
. We assume that all disorder assumes Gaussian white noise distribution, with disorder
average (cid:104)(cid:104)VN (x)VN (x(cid:48))(cid:105)(cid:105) = ∆N δ(x − x(cid:48)). Then performing the disorder averaging, we arrive at the replicated action

FIG. 2:
WSM arises from diagram (i), while its leading order correction due to weak disorder stems from diagrams (ii) and (iii). Solid,
dashed and wavy lines respectively represent fermions, disorder and external gauge ﬁeld.

where a, b are replica indices, and ¯Ψ = Ψ†γ0 as usual. For convenience we have slightly modiﬁed the deﬁnition of the
γ matrices from the main part of the paper according to γ0 = τ1 ⊗ α0, γj = τ2 ⊗ αj for j = 1, 2, 3 and γ5 = τ3 ⊗ α0.
Various types of elastic scatters (disorder) are realized with diﬀerent choices of 4 × 4 matrices, as shown in Tab. I.
Notice that due to linearly dispersing quasiparticles WSM corresponds to a z = 1 ﬁxed point. Consequently under the
rescaling of space-time(imaginary) coordinates (x, τ ) → el (x, τ ). The Euclidean action ¯S in Eq. (6) remains invariant
under such coarse graining only when accompanied by rescaling of fermionic ﬁeld according to Ψ → e−dl/2Ψ. The
scaling dimension of disorder coupling then reads as [∆N ] = 2z − d = −1 for d = 3, for any choice of N . Therefore,
any weak disorder is an irrelevant perturbation at the z = 1 ﬁxed point, describing a clean WSM.

• Generation of axial disorder in renormalization group framework: We here show how axial disorder
(∆A) can be generated from all types of disorder (except the potential disorder) once we account for quantum (loop)
corrections. For this purpose computation of simple one-loop diagrams, shown in Fig. 2(a), is suﬃcient and serves
the purpose. Total contribution from these two diagrams reads as

where the integral over momentum is carried out within the Wilsonian shell Λe−l < |k| < Λ and ∆N/M captures the
strength of diﬀerent types of elastic scatterer characterized by 4 × 4 matrix N/M (see Table I). The noninteracting
Green’s function is given by

G0(iω, k) = − iγ0ω + iγjkj

where a and b are replica indices. Thus aforementioned four disorders generate axial disorder. The eﬀect of mass
disorder in WSM is more subtle. In Weyl semimetal the scalar mass and the pseudo-scalar mass disorder are present
in WSM simultaneously. The quantum corrections arising from diagrams (i) and (ii) of Fig. 2(a) in the presence of
two mass disorder ∆S and ∆P S yield

where j = 1, 2, 3. Therefore, mass disorder (∆S and ∆P S) in Weyl semimetal generates magnetic disorder (∆M )
through loop corrections. As we have shown in Eq. (9), magnetic disorder in turn generates axial disorder. Therefore,
to appreciate the scaling of optical conductivity it is suﬃcient to examine the eﬀects of regular charge impurity
(∆V ) and axial disorder (∆A). A complete renormaliazation group analysis in the presence of all disorder couplings
is an interesting problem, which however, falls outside the central theme of current work and deserves a separate
publication. Nevertheless, the above exercise justiﬁes our claim that salient features of the scaling properties of op-
tical conductivity can be captured by focusing on (1) random charge impurity and (2) random axial chemical potential.

TABLE I: Various types of disorder represented by fermionic bilinears (j = 1, 2, 3), their symmetries under pseudo time-reversal
(T ), parity (P), continuous chiral rotation (Uc) and charge-conjugation (C), disorder coupling (∆N ), and the corresponding
sign function [f (∆N )]. Note that true time-reversal symmetry in WSM in already broken. The pseudo time-reversal symmetry
T is generated by an anti-unitary operator γ0γ2K, where K is complex conjugation, such that T 2 = −1 (The true time-reversal
operator is γ1γ3K). The parity operator is generated P = γ0, while the charge-conjugation operator is C = γ2. The continuous
chiral symmetry (Uc) of WSM is generated by γ5. Here (cid:88) and × signiﬁes even and odd under a symmetry operation.

• Optical properties of clean WSM: We now present the calculation of the optical conductivity (OC) of a clean
WSM. The OC in clean WSM at zero temperature (T = 0) can be extracted from the current-current correlation
function, which as a function of external frequency (Matsubara) has the form

Hence the total OC in wekly disordered WSM is given by

Notice that in three spatial dimensions ∆N Λ/(π2v2) = ˆ∆N is the dimensionless disorder coupling. Hence, to the
leading order in disorder coupling and for small frequency, i.e. Ω/(2vΛ) (cid:28) 1, we can compactly write the total OC as

(cid:60)(σ)(Ω) = σ0

(33)
• Method of integration: Finally, we comment on some essential mathematical steps that were used to compute
the optical conductivity of clean and weakly disordered WSMs. Notice that integral over internal frequency (ω) can
readily be performed using residue formula. On the other hand, we here compute the integrals over the internal
momentum in spatial dimensions d = 3 − , and at the end send  → 0, closely following the spirit of dimensional
regularization that manifestly preserves the gauge invariance.

In particular, when we compute the correction to OC due to disorder (from two-loop diagrams (ii) and (iii) in
Fig. 2(b)) for which the expressions are given in Eqs. (18) and (19), the strategy is to ﬁrst perform the integrals over
the frequency and the momentum k, and only at the end integrate over the momentum p. In the last step, it is useful
to separately integrate out the part of the integrand even under p → −p in d = 3, using the fact that this piece is of
the form

I = csc(dπ)

dp F (d, p),

(34)

(cid:90) ∞

0

10
where d = 3 − , csc(x) = 1/ sin(x), and the function F (d, p) has the property F (d,−p) = (−1)2dF (d, p). To compute
the last integral, let us consider the following integral, which can be in our case readily computed by using the Cauchy
theorem,

dp csc(dπ) F (d, p) = C + O().

(35)

(cid:90) ∞

−∞

After splitting this integral in two parts from −∞ to 0, and 0 to ∞, substituting p → −p in the ﬁrst term and using
the parity property of the function F (d, p), we have

(cid:90) ∞

−∞

dp csc(dπ)F (d, p) =(cid:0)1 + (−1)2d(cid:1) I = [2 + C1 + O(2)]I,

with C1 as a constant. We know that the left hand side is of the form C + O(), and therefore

I = C/2 + O().

The part that is odd under p → −p is easily computed by using some elementary integrations.
