Abstract

The factorization method is used to construct two diﬀerent spectrum generating
algebras for the radial oscillator. The states are classiﬁed in hierarchies according
to either the orbital angular momentum or the energy.
It is shown that the Lie
groups SU (1, 1) and SU (2) are the dynamical groups of the deﬁnite orbital angular
momentum and deﬁnite energy hierarchies respectively. Diﬀerent representation
spaces of ﬁnite dimension are constructed in the latter case. The generators of
the Lie algebras su(1, 1) and su(2) are expressed in the Schwinger representation
and the corresponding generalized coherent states are constructed. It is shown that
squeezing occurs in terms of the complex parameter that labels the coherent states.

Introduction

It is well known that the Lie groups admitted by the mathematical models of physi-
cal phenomena determine the special functions that describe the corresponding quantum
states [1–3]. Of special interest, the Lie groups SU (1, 1) and SU (2) play the role of dy-
namical group for a series of exactly solvable quantum systems that includes the harmonic
oscillator, Morse oscillator, Coulomb potential, angular momentum, qubit and qudit sys-
tems among others.

2H and J± = 1

A remarkable example is given by the one dimensional oscillator H = N + 1

2 for which
2(a±)2, with [a−, a+] = I and N = a+a−, satisfy the
the operators J3 = 1
commutation relations of the Lie algebra su(1, 1) [2], pp 383. As the Casimir operator is
calculated to be proportional to the identity C = − 3
I = κ(κ − 1)I, the Bargmann index
κ leads to two classes of energy eigenstates: even for κ = 1
4. The full
space of states is then covered by two inﬁnite representations of SU (1, 1).

Another important example, dealing with the subject of the present work, is the 3D
isotropic oscillator for which the symplectic group Sp(6) ⊃ Sp(2) ⊗ O(3) is the dynamical
group [4]. Thus, in spherical polar coordinates the quantum states of the 3D oscillator
are characterized by O(3), the rotation group, while Sp(2) is the generating group of the
radial spectrum. Considering that Sp(2) ∼ SU (1, 1), it is quite natural to ﬁnd that the
spectrum of the radial oscillator is generated by the algebra of SU (1, 1). Below we present
an alternative development of the spectrum generating algebra for the radial oscillator.
This is based on the factorization method, as it was introduced in Quantum Mechanics
by Dirac [5], promoted by Schr¨odinger [6], and developed by Infeld and Hull [7] (see also
the review [8]).

In this paper we factorize the radial part of the spherical oscillator Hamiltonian in four
diﬀerent (basic or canonical) forms and show that the factors can be used to construct
the basis elements of the Lie algebras of SU (1, 1) and SU (2). In the former case we show
that the full state space is covered by a denumerable set of inﬁnite-dimensional repre-
sentations of SU (1, 1), spanned each one by oscillator states of deﬁnite orbital angular
momentum. In the second case we ﬁnd three diﬀerent forms of achieving ﬁnite representa-
tions of SU (2). The ﬁrst one is by considering the accidental degeneracy of the oscillator
energy eigenvalues. The full space of states is covered in this case by a denumerable set of
degeneracy subspaces, each one a representation space of SU (2). A second way of obtain-
ing ﬁnite representations of SU (2) is considering the transitions between the vectors in a
given degeneracy. We show that the allowed transitions involve intermediary states that
are, by necessity, of undeﬁned energy. These last together with the subspace of degener-
ated vectors span a ﬁnite representation of SU (2) that is diﬀerent from the ones indicated
above. The third way of constructing representation spaces for SU (2) is based on the al-
lowed transitions between the admissible states of the radial oscillator. Paying attention
to the coordinate-representation of the wave-functions one immediately recognizes that
the radial quantum number accounts the related number of nodes. We show that a pair
of our canonical factorizing operators are indeed ladder operators for the radial quantum
number that labels a given wave-function. Moreover, these operators produce also the
transitions (cid:96) → (cid:96)± 1, with (cid:96) the orbital quantum number labelling the wave-functions. In
this form, the third representation of SU (2) is spanned by subspaces of state vectors that
are connected by the allowed transitions of the system. Thus, we ﬁnd that both SU (1, 1)
and SU (2) are generating groups for the radial oscillator. Our identiﬁcation of su(1, 1) as
the generating algebra of the radial oscillator shows that the factorization method devel-
oped here is equivalent to the representation theory reported in [4]. Quite interestingly,
we ﬁnd that the factorization constant (cid:96) that deﬁnes the building-blocks of the su(1, 1)
algebra corresponds to the Bargmann index κ = 1
4 that characterizes the rep-
resentation. On the other hand, the identiﬁcation and construction of ﬁnite-dimensional
representations of SU (2) as an alternative generating group of the radial oscillator has
been, as far as we know, unnoticed in the literature on the matter until the present work.

Provided the representations of SU (1, 1) and SU (2) in terms of the radial oscillator
wave-functions we construct the related coherent states by following the approximation
of either Perelomov [3], Barut and Girardelo [9], or both of them. Some insights of the

2

SU (1, 1) coherent states reported here have been already remarked in [10] and [11] for the
Perelomov and Barut-Girardello approaches respectively. In [10] these states are deﬁned
for (cid:96) ﬁxed and called ‘radial coherent states’, in [11] they are constructed in association
with the so-called Calogero-Sutherland oscillator. Our results in this context represent
a reﬁnement because the factorization method permits the explanation of some aspects
that were unclosed in [10, 11]. For instance, we show that the generators of the su(1, 1)
algebra are expressed in the two-boson representation of Schwinger [12], so that the related
coherent states are aﬀected by the two-mode squeezing of the quadratures. On the other
hand, the construction of the SU (2) coherent states for the radial oscillator seems to be
not reported in any place previous to the results presented here. For both generating
groups SU (1, 1) and SU (2), we show that almost all our coherent states are squeezed
for the quadratures under the criterion of Wodkiewicz and Eberly [13]. That is, if the
2|(cid:104)K3(cid:105)| in the coherent state of a given representation,
variance of K1 or K2 is less than 1
then such state is said to be squeezed. Here K1, K2 and K3 are the generators of either
SU (1, 1) or SU (2).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide four canonical factoriza-
tions of the radial oscillator Hamiltonian as well as the algebra of the basic operators
that will be used as the building-blocks of the su(1, 1) and su(2) generating algebras.
We also distinguish between two classes of states that will span the representation spaces
(hierarchies): states of deﬁnite orbital angular moment and states of deﬁnite energy. In
Section 3 we detail the construction of the generating algebras and the related coher-
ent states. Section 3.1 is devoted to the algebra of SU (1, 1) and to the corresponding
inﬁnite-dimensional representation in terms of the hierarchies of deﬁnite orbital angular
momentum. The Barut-Girardelo coherent states are constructed in Section 3.1.1; we
show that these are minimum uncertainty states that evolve in time by oscillating back
and forth between two turning points while the packet spreads as its center approaches
the outer turning point. The Perelomov coherent states are constructed as displaced ver-
sions of the ‘vacuum’ in Section 3.1.2. There, we show that the displacement operator is
indeed a two-mode squeeze operator leading to the squeezing of the quadrature variances.
Section 3.2 deals with the algebra of SU (2). In 3.2.1 we construct in detail the ﬁnite rep-
resentation spaces of this group and the Perelomov coherent states are derived in 3.2.2; we
show that these states are squeezed depending on the phase φ of the complex parameter
z = |z|e−iφ that labels the superposition. In Section 3.3 we analyze the transition proba-
bilities in the hierarchies of deﬁnite energy and show that a set of Dicke-like states arises
when the transitions are equally probable. We also show that these states span another
ﬁnite representation of SU (2). In Section 4 we discuss about the third way of getting a
ﬁnite representation of SU (2) and comment some of the generalities of the corresponding
coherent states. In Section 5 we present some conclusions and perspectives of the present
work. The paper concludes with a pair of appendices containing complementary informa-
tion that is relevant in diﬀerent parts of the manuscript but can be consulted in separate
form.

The general solution of this last linear equation, with 2En instead of (cid:96), is given in (A-27)
and serves as a repository seed of solutions to the nonlinear Riccati equation (9). As
discussed below, there are two immediate particular solutions of (9) that give rise to four
diﬀerent factorizations.

2.3 Canonical factorizations and hierarchies of states

In the previous sections we have constructed four diﬀerent factorizations for the radial
Hamiltonian

H(cid:96) = a

H(cid:96) = b

†
†
(cid:96)−1 + (cid:96)−2,
(cid:96)a(cid:96) + (cid:96), H(cid:96) = a(cid:96)−1a
(cid:96)b(cid:96) − (cid:96)−2, H(cid:96) = b(cid:96)+1b
(cid:96)+1 − (cid:96).
†
†

These expressions were already noticed in [16] by looking for the dynamical algebras
associated with the radial oscillator equation (see also [17]). Here we call them canonical
factorizations because they have been constructed by using a pair of particular solutions
of the Riccati equation (9), in the spirit of the conventional factorization [7]. Other
factorizations, named after Mielnik [18], are easily obtained by taking α = − d
dr ln v, with
γ and δ properly chosen in the general function (A-27).

Using (45)–(46), it is immediate to verify that the vectors |ϕk(cid:105) such that

(50)
are solutions of H(cid:96)|ϕk(cid:105) = λk|ϕk(cid:105) with λ1 = −λ4 = (cid:96) and λ2 = −λ3 = (cid:96)−2. Among
these, only |ϕ1(cid:105) satisﬁes the appropriate boundary conditions in position-representation
ϕ1(r) := (cid:104)r|ϕ1(cid:105). Thus, |ϕ1(cid:105) = |(cid:96), (cid:96)(cid:105)e = |0, (cid:96)(cid:105) is the state belonging to the lowest admissible
eigenvalue E(cid:96) = E0,(cid:96) = (cid:96) of H(cid:96) for (cid:96) ﬁxed. The relevance of these last results will be clear
in Section 3.

Now, let us consider the set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of H(cid:96),
En = 2n + 3 = 4s + 2(cid:96) + 3 ≡ Es,(cid:96).

|n, (cid:96)(cid:105)e ≡ |s, (cid:96)(cid:105),

(51)

The relation between n, s and (cid:96) permits the following classiﬁcation of states:

1. Deﬁnite orbital angular momentum states. For ﬁxed (cid:96) we have an inﬁnite number

of possible energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors,
|s, (cid:96)(cid:105) ≡ |s(cid:105)(cid:96), Es,(cid:96) = (cid:96) + 4s,

(52)
We say that the inﬁnite-dimensional space H(cid:96) spanned by the vectors |s(cid:105)(cid:96) is an
(cid:96)-hierarchy of deﬁnite orbital angular momentum states.

s = 0, 1, . . .

2. Deﬁnite energy states. For ﬁxed n one has a ﬁnite number of possible energy eigen-

values and eigenvectors

|n, (cid:96)(cid:105)e, En = 2n + 3, n = 2s + (cid:96) = 0, 1, . . .

(53)
We say that the ﬁnite-dimensional space H(n) spanned by the vectors |n, (cid:96)(cid:105)e is an En-
hierarchy of deﬁnite energy states. The dimension of H(n) is equal to the accidental
degeneracy d = deg(En) of the related energy eigenvalue.

Intertwining algebras and coherent states

The intertwining relationships deﬁned in Section 2 connect the elements of a given (cid:96)-
hierarchy with the ones of the (cid:96) ± 1 hierarchy, and the elements of the En-hierarchy with
the ones of the En±1-hierarchy. In this section we look for relationships intertwining the
elements of a given hierarchy with other elements of the same hierarchy. The main idea is
to ﬁnd the combinations of operators a and b, Eqs. (29) and (42), that produce vertical,
horizontal or diagonal mappings s ↔ s + 1 in the ((cid:96), s)-plane.

3 and LM± the su(1, 1) generators reported by Quesne and Moshinsky for a 3D
with LM
harmonic oscillator with (cid:96) ﬁxed (after integrating out the angular variables) [4]. The factor
r at the left of the Moshinsky operators obeys the fact that the treatment in [4] is based
on the radial functions Rn(cid:96)(r) while ours is developed on the functions un(cid:96)(r) = rRn(cid:96)(r),
see Appendix A. The above expressions show that SU (1, 1) is the generating group of the
radial oscillator. Considering the Moshinsky Casimir of the algebra C M = 1
4), with
L2 given in (A-8), we see that the Bargmann index κ of the representation is deﬁned by
the factorization constant κ = 1
4(cid:96). That is, for the two-mode boson realization
(60), we have κ = 3
4, 5
4, . . . The space of states of the radial oscillator decomposes into
κ=3/4 Hκ, where the ‘vertical’ subspaces Hκ are the (cid:96)-hierarchies of
deﬁnite angular momentum H(cid:96) introduced in Section 2. As indicated, the basis states
will be written in the shorthand notation |κ, s(cid:105) ↔ |s, (cid:96)(cid:105) = |s(cid:105)(cid:96).

On the other hand, expressions (59)–(62) are the Schwinger representation of the
su(1, 1) Lie algebra for which the deﬁnite angular momentum operators L± are linked to
the two bosons a± and b±, whenever Ns + N(cid:96) + 1 = 2L3, see [12]. In this context, the
boson occupation 2L3 gives the number 2(s + κ). Thus, given κ, the representation is
labelled by the radial quantum number s. In addition, the action of L± on the vectors
belonging to the (cid:96)-hierarchy is given by

L−|s(cid:105)(cid:96) =(cid:112)s(s + (cid:96) + 1/2)|s − 1(cid:105)(cid:96), L+|s(cid:105)(cid:96) =(cid:112)(s + 1)(s + (cid:96) + 3/2)|s + 1(cid:105)(cid:96).

(64)

That is, acting on the points in the ((cid:96), s)-plane, the operator L− (L+) produces vertical
displacements by decreasing (increasing) the radial quantum number s in one unit, as
desired. Moreover, s (cid:55)→ s± 1 leads to n (cid:55)→ n± 2, so that the action of A(cid:96) and A
†
(cid:96) depicted
in Figure 3 produces jumps of energy in steps of four units just because there are two
photons involved in the energy transitions (remember that En is twice the dimensionless
energy En of the spherical oscillator).

For completeness, besides the commutation rules (32) and (43), in the Schwinger

representation we have

other hand, given (cid:96) the probability density exhibits more than one peak for |z| >> (cid:96), as
it is shown in Figures 4(a–c).

An additional form of |z(cid:105)BG is available by writing the deﬁnite angular momentum

vector |s(cid:105)(cid:96) as the result of the iterated action of L+ on the ground state |0(cid:105)(cid:96), that is

• Time evolution and classical behaviour. The time-evolution of the coherent state
(67) is easily shown to be

|z; t(cid:105)BG = e−iH(cid:96)t|z(cid:105)BG = e−iλ(2(cid:96)+3)t|z(t)(cid:105)BG,

z(t) = ze−i4λt,

(79)

where the parameter λ = mω
 has been retrieved for clarity. That is, the time-dependence
of our coherent state is encoded in the phase of the complex eigenvalue z(t) = |z|e−i(φ+4λt)
with z(0) = z, as usual. With this result in (71) we see that the time-evolution of the
probability density |ϕBG
(r, t)|2 is periodic with angular frequency 2λ (twice the oscillation
frequency ω). The center of the wave-packet oscillates back and forth between two turning
points that depend on |z| (see Figure 6) and can be determined by matching the average
energy E

(cid:96) with the eﬀective potential:

Moreover, as by construction (cid:104)L−(cid:105)BG = z and (cid:104)L+(cid:105)BG = z∗, with z∗ the complex conjugate
of z ∈ C, we immediately have (cid:104)L1(cid:105)BG = Re(z) = |z| cos φ and (cid:104)L1(cid:105)BG = Im(z) = |z| sin φ.
Considering the time-dependence φ → φ + 4λt we see that (cid:104)L1(cid:105)BG and (cid:104)L2(cid:105)BG behave
as the classical generalized coordinates associated with a harmonic oscillator of period

In all cases φ = 0 is the initial condition and the vertical axis
measures time in units of τ = 2λt. The wave packet propagates in time by oscillating back and forth
between two turning points that depend on |z|. At τ = 2kπ, k ∈ Z+, for |z| >> (cid:96), the probability density
exhibits a series of peaks that are disseminated close to the origin, see ﬁgures (b–c) and (f). The packet
becomes broad and single peaked as its center approaches the outer turning point.

z

4λ. An interpretation of these results is as follows. The center of the packet ϕBG

T = π
(r, t)
behaves as a classical particle in the radial oscillator potential that describes elliptical
paths by oscillating twice between the turning points during one complete period.

z

On the other hand, the probability density becomes narrow as it approaches the origin
and spreads about the outer turning point (see Figure 6). The phenomenon may be
interpreted as a generalized squeezing due to the centrifugal barrier of the potential If
|z| >> (cid:96), the probability density exhibits a series of local maxima (peaks), the number of
which depends on the value of the phase φ and evolves in time periodically as it is shown
in Figures 6 and 7.

z (r) deﬁned in (84) for the indicated

The expression (84) has been linked with the so called ‘radial coherent states’ reported
in [10]. There, the authors use the Moshinky realization of the su(1, 1) algebra for the

16

isotropic oscillator [4] as point of departure. Here, such a realization corresponds to the
position-representation (77) of the quadratures (76) associated to the deﬁnite angular
momentum operators L±, as this has been discussed in the previous section.

To verify that |z(cid:105)P is the result of a displacement let us rewrite it in the form

|z(cid:105)P = (1 − |z|2)

2(cid:96)+3

4 ezL+e−zL−|0(cid:105)(cid:96),

where we have used (72). Then, applying the well known disentangling formula [3],

eξL+−ξL− = ezL+eln(1−|z|2)L3e−zL−,

z = ξ|ξ| tanh(|ξ|),

ξ ∈ C,

(85)

(86)

one immediately gets

|z(cid:105)P = D(ξ)|0(cid:105)(cid:96) with D(ξ) = eξL+−ξL−.

(87)
That is, the Perelomov coherent states |z(cid:105)P are displaced versions of the ‘vacuum’ deﬁnite
angular momentum state |0(cid:105)(cid:96) (remember, the radial quantum number s = 0 means zero
nodes in position-representation). This is precisely the reason for which the related prob-
ability density is single peaked for any value of the orbital quantum number (cid:96) and the
phase φ. A fact unnoticed in the literature on the matter already published (see e.g., [10]).
• Time evolution. The time-evolution of these coherent states is also encoded in
the phase of the complex number z, namely |z; t(cid:105)P = e−iλ(2(cid:96)+3)t|z(t)(cid:105)P , with z(t) =
|z|e−i(φ+4λt). Again, the wave packet oscillates back and forth with frequency 2λ and
spreads as its center approximates the outer turning point (see Figure 9).

Figure 9: Time-evolution of the probability density |ϕP
the vertical axis measures time in units of τ = 2λt. In (b) the vertical axis refers to the amplitude of the
probability density. As in Figure 6, the wave packet propagates by oscillating back and forth between the
origin and the outer turning point. In this case the probability density is single peaked and spreads as
its center approaches the outer turning point. The density proﬁles at the right correspond to the times

• Uncertainty relation. As indicated in Section 3.1, L± correspond to the Schwinger

So that the inequality (75) is reduced to an equality only for z = 0. This last means that
only the coherent state |0(cid:105)P = |0(cid:105)(cid:96) minimizes the uncertainty between L1 and L2.
• Squeezing and nonclassical behaviour. For other values of z occurs squeezing if the
variance of either L1 or L2 is smaller than the related average uncertainty [13]. Explicitly,
either

(∆L1)2 <

is fulﬁlled. In general, according to (75), the variance of one quadrature is reduced at the
expense of the other. In Figure 10 we can appreciate that the phase φ alternates such
squeezing between the quadratures (compare with [10]). In particular, L1 is squeezed for
φ = π
2 , . . ., and L2 for φ = 0, π, 2π, . . . Thus, L2 is squeezed around the turning points

2 , 3π

18

identiﬁed in Figure 9 because they are reached by the wave packet center at the times in
which z(t) has a global phase equal to entire multiples of π. In turn, L1 is squeezed at
one and three quarters of the entire period. Similar properties are true for the Perelomov
coherent states |z(cid:105)P associated with other (cid:96)-hierarchies.

To be more precise, it is well known that the Glauber-Sudarshan P -function [27, 28]
used to calculate a given variance (∆X)2 that is squeezed does not have the character of
a probability distribution because it is either negative or highly singular [29]. Therefore,
the related system has not classical description. This is precisely the case of the quadra-
ture variances (96), so that the radial oscillator prepared in the coherent state |z(cid:105)P is
nonclassical for z (cid:54)= 0 and φ = n π

Thus, B(cid:96) and B+
(cid:96) operate in a speciﬁc En-hierarchy by decreasing and increasing the
radial quantum number s in one unit (see Figure 11). Hereafter they are referred to as
deﬁnite energy ladder operators.

[D(cid:96), B(cid:96)] = −4B(cid:96).

(106)

(107)

Following the steps of the previous sections we now introduce the free-index operators2:

(108)
2From (97) it is clear that one has an additional representation for J±. Namely, J+ = b−a+ and

J3 = 1

J+ = a+b−,

J− = b+a−,

2(Ns − N(cid:96)),

J− = a−b+.

20

that is

J+ ↔ 1
4B

†
(cid:96) ,

J− ↔ 1

4B(cid:96),

J3 ↔ 1

4D(cid:96).

Then the commutators (106) and (107) correspond to the Lie algebra of SU (2),

[J−, J+] = −2J3,

[J3, J±] = ±J±.

(109)

(110)

The expressions (106)–(110) are the Schwinger representation of the su(2) algebra for
which the deﬁnite energy ladder operators J± are linked to the two bosons a± and b±
provided that 2J3 = Ns − N(cid:96). In this case the boson occupation 2J3 leads to −((cid:96) + 1
2), so
that the representation is determined by the orbital quantum number (cid:96).

In addition to the commutation rules (32), (43) and (65), we have

[J±, a∓] = ∓b∓,

[J±, b±] = ±a±,

[J3, a±] = ± 1

2a±,

[J3, b∓] = ± 1

2b∓.

(111)

[J±, a±] = [J±, b∓] = 0,

2

The action of J± on the vectors belonging to the En-hierarchy is as follows
J−|(cid:96), (cid:96)(cid:105)e = 0,

J−|n, (cid:96)(cid:105)e = 1

J+|n, (cid:96)(cid:105)e = 1

(cid:112)(n − (cid:96))(n + (cid:96) + 3)|n, (cid:96) + 2(cid:105)e,
J−|s, (cid:96)(cid:105) =(cid:112)s(s + (cid:96) + 3/2)|s − 1, (cid:96) + 2(cid:105),

(cid:112)(n − (cid:96) + 2)(n + (cid:96) + 1)|n, (cid:96) − 2(cid:105)e.
J+|s, (cid:96)(cid:105) =(cid:112)(s + 1)(s + (cid:96) + 1/2)|s + 1, (cid:96) − 2(cid:105).

For completeness, in ((cid:96), s)-conﬁguration, the above expressions are written as

J−|0, (cid:96)(cid:105) = 0,

2

(112)

(113)

(114)

(115)

Thus, acting on the points of the ((cid:96), s)-plane, J−(J+) produces horizontal displacements
by decreasing (increasing) the radial quantum number s in one unit, as desired. At the
same time the orbital quantum number (cid:96) is increased (decreased) in two units. In this
form, the representation determined by s ((cid:96)) implies that J− and J+ are annihilation
(creation) and creation (annihilation) operators respectively. This two-fold proﬁle of J±
plays a relevant role in the following calculations.

3.2.1 Representation spaces
As indicated in Section 2, the dimension of the En-hierarchy H(n) is ﬁnite and equal
In particular,
to the accidental degeneracy d = deg(En) of the energy eigenvalue En.

derived in the previous section, it is required the existence of two extremal vectors such
that J−|ϕlow(cid:105) = 0 and J+|ϕhig(cid:105) = 0, otherwise the representation would be not ﬁnite
dimensional. From (112), it is clear that |ϕlow(cid:105) = |(cid:96), (cid:96)(cid:105)e. However, the states that are
annihilated by J+ = b−a+ = a+b− are unphysical. This last is particularly true for the
†
(cid:96)−1 and b(cid:96) respectively.
vectors deﬁned in (48) and (49) because they are annihilated by a

21

Therefore, in order to get a ﬁnite representation of the group that rules the dynamics of
the deﬁnite energy states, we have to look for an additional realization of the su(2) Lie
algebra in the En-hierarchies.

Bearing in mind that |n, (cid:96)(cid:105)e is eigenvector of J3 with eigenvalue m = − 1

4(2(cid:96) + 1), and
that n = 2s + (cid:96) is ﬁxed while s = 0, 1, . . . , d − 1, we ﬁnd that the admissible values of
(cid:96) are equidistant in two units and even (odd) for n even (odd), going from 0 (1) to n.
Let us make the transformation m → µ = m + µ0, with µ0 = 1
4(n + 1) for n even and
µ0 = 1

(119)

the present case decomposed into the direct sum (cid:76)∞

are eigenstates of S3 with eigenvalue µ. In other words, the set (118)-(119) solves the
spectral decomposition of S3. The space H(n) spanned by the eigenvectors of S3 is d =
(2j+1)-dimensional. In Table 1 of Appendix B we specify this result for the En-hierarchies
deﬁned by the ﬁrst 6 energy levels. The space of states of the radial oscillator is in
n=0 H(n), where the deﬁnite energy
hierarchies H(n) are ‘horizontal’ subspaces.
We now proceed to get the representation of the ladder operators S± ∈ SU (2) in the

basis (119). With this aim let us rewrite

k = 1, 2, . . . , 2j + 1 (n even)

k = 1, 2, . . . , 2j + 1

(n odd)

(120)

so that µ ↔ µp = j − p + 1 with p = 1, 2, . . . , 2j + 1, regardless of wheter n is even or
odd. Accordingly, the relationship (119) is simpliﬁed

(cid:40) 2(k − 1),

;

p = 1, 2, . . . , 2j + 1.

(121)

In particular, the extremal states |j, j(cid:105)J and |j,−j(cid:105)J are obtained for p = 1 and p = 2j + 1
respectively; they are linked to deﬁnite energy states as follows

(cid:40) |n, 0(cid:105)e

Now, according to [20, 21], let us introduce the dyadic expressions

which are Hubbard operators in their simplest representation and correspond to (2j + 1)-
square matrices that have entry 1 in position (p, q) and zero in all other entries. In this
form we have the Hubbard representation of the operators we are looking for

These last generate the su(2) Lie algebra in the space of deﬁnite energy states

[S3, S±] = ±S±,

[S−, S+] = −2S3.

The representations deﬁned by the ﬁrst En-hierarchies can be consulted in Appendix B.
We have shown that SU (2) is the generating group of the deﬁnite energy hierarchies.
Here the spectrum is the set of values that can take either the radial quantum number s
or the orbital one (cid:96), provided that n is ﬁxed.

The action of S3 and S± on the elements of the En-hierarchy is as follows

S3|j, µp(cid:105)J = µp|j, µp(cid:105)J ,

S+|j, µp(cid:105)J =(cid:112)(p − 1)(2j + 2 − p)|j, µp−1(cid:105)J ,
S−|j, µp(cid:105)J =(cid:112)p(2j + 1 − p)|j, µp+1(cid:105)J .

3.2.2 SU (2) Perelomov coherent states
We now use |j,−j(cid:105)J as the extremal state to be displaced in order to get the related
Perelomov coherent states. That is,

|n, z(cid:105)P = D(ξ)|j,−j(cid:105)J with D(ξ) = eξS+−ξS−,

ξ ∈ C.

(131)

Using the disentangling formula [3],

eξS+−ξS− = ezS+eln(1+|z|2)J3e−zS−,

(132)
together with (130) and the fact that |j,−j(cid:105)J is annihilated by S−, it is immediate to
obtain

z = ξ|ξ| tan(|ξ|) ∈ C,

The behaviour of the above quantities is shown in Figure 12. We can appreciate that
inequality (135) becomes an identity for either |z| = 0 and any value of φ, or for φ = nπ/2,
n = 0, 1, . . ., and any value of |z| (although this last has been taken equal to 1.8 in the
ﬁgure). Squeezing of S1 and S2 occurs in the vicinity of φ = nπ and φ = (2n + 1) π
2
respectively (compare with [13]). Thus, we have classical-to-quantum and quantum-to-
classical transitions due to the phase of the complex parameter |z|e−iφ that do not depend
on the value of (cid:104)S3(cid:105)0, see Figure 13. As in the squeezing occurring for the deﬁnite angular
momentum states, one of the quadratures of the deﬁnite energy states is reduced at the
expense of the other around the above indicated points. Notice however that this is
not true for all the values of the phase φ. For instance, taking φ ≈ π
4 , . . ., both of the
variances are bigger than the average uncertainty, so that neither squeezing nor minimized
uncertainty is present.

3.3 Transition probabilities

†
(cid:96) act on
In Section 3.2 we have shown that the deﬁnite energy ladder operators B(cid:96) and B
the states |n, (cid:96)(cid:105)e by aﬀecting the orbital quantum number (cid:96) in two units. That is, the
transitions between the states of a given En-hierarchy are ruled by the condition ∆(cid:96) = ±2
(see for instance Figure 14). The SU (2) Perelomov coherent states (134) are indeed a
linear combination of vectors such that the orbital label decreases in two units as the sum
index increases one unit. Then, one can show that

r = 0, 1, . . . , 2j,

(140)

is the probability of ﬁnding the coherent state with the orbital angular momentum deﬁned
by (cid:96) = n − 2r. However, the Schwinger representation of B(cid:96) and B
†
(cid:96) includes two bosons,
so that the transitions between deﬁnite energy states |n, (cid:96)(cid:105)e must be ruled by the action
of the ladder operators a± and b±.
In this respect, we should notice that there is a
series of intermediary states that connect two arbitrary vectors in a given En-hierarchy.
The intermediary states are by necessity of undeﬁned energy but deﬁnite angular orbital
momentum. For instance, the H(2) hierarchy depicted in Figure 14 includes only two
allowed transitions: |2, 0(cid:105)e ↔ |2, 2(cid:105)e. Using the boson operators a± and b± we see that an
arbitrary superposition of the states |0(cid:105)1 and |1(cid:105)1 is involved. As no preference is a priori
considered, both intermediary vectors must occur with equal probability, so that we have
the transitions

|2, 0(cid:105)e ↔ 1√

2

(|0(cid:105)1 + e−iχ|1(cid:105)1) ↔ |2, 2(cid:105)e, χ ∈ [0, 2π).

(141)

Figure 14: Intertwining between the deﬁnite energy states |2, 0(cid:105)e and |2, 2(cid:105)e that share the eigenvalue
E2 = 7. The transitions |2, 0(cid:105)e ↔ |2, 2(cid:105)e are regulated by an intermediary state 1√
(|0(cid:105)1 + e−iχ|1(cid:105)1) of
undeﬁned energy but deﬁnite orbital angular momentum ((cid:96) = 1). The same diagram corresponds to
the transitions |0(cid:105)1 ↔ |1(cid:105)1, these last regulated by an intermediary state |2, e−iφ(cid:105)P of undeﬁned orbital
angular momentum but deﬁnite energy.

2

Notice that each of the three vectors in (141) represents a state of well-deﬁned angular
momentum. Moreover, they can be used as the orthonormal basis of a 3-dimensional
representation space associated to the E2-hierarchy:

|1,−1(cid:105)D1 = |2, 2(cid:105)e,

|1, 0(cid:105)D1 = 1√

2

(|1, 1(cid:105)e + |3, 1(cid:105)e),

|1, 1(cid:105)D1 = |2, 0(cid:105)e,

(142)

26

where |0(cid:105)1 = |1, 1(cid:105)e, |1(cid:105)1 = |3, 1(cid:105)e, and the phase χ has been ﬁxed as χ = 0 for simplic-
ity. A similar description holds by analyzing the transition between the deﬁnite angular
momentum states |0(cid:105)1 and |1(cid:105)1 showed in Figure 14. In this case the Perelomov vector
|2, e−iφ(cid:105)P plays the role of intermediary state with identical probability of occurrence for
the related deﬁnite energy states
|1(cid:105)1 ↔ 1√

(|2, 2(cid:105)e + e−iφ|2, 0(cid:105)e) ↔ |0(cid:105)1.

(143)

2

Then, we have a 3-dimensional representation space associated with the (cid:96) = 1 hierarchy:

|1,−1(cid:105)D2 = |3, 1(cid:105)e,

|1, 0(cid:105)D2 =

1√
2

(|2, 0(cid:105)e + |2, 2(cid:105)e),

|1, 1(cid:105)D2 = |1, 1(cid:105)e,

(144)

where we have taken φ = 0. Other two representation spaces of dimension 3 can be
achieved by considering the diagram shown in Figure 15. For the E3 and (cid:96) = 2 hierarchies
we respectively have

|1,−1(cid:105)D3 = |3, 3(cid:105)e,
|1,−1(cid:105)D4 = |4, 2(cid:105)e,

|1, 0(cid:105)D3 = 1√

|1, 1(cid:105)D3 = |3, 1(cid:105)e,
|1, 1(cid:105)D4 = |2, 2(cid:105)e,

(145)

(146)

where |0(cid:105)2 = |2, 2(cid:105)e and |1(cid:105)2 = |4, 2(cid:105)e, with χ = φ = 0.

Figure 15: Intertwining between the deﬁnite energy states |3, 1(cid:105)e and |3, 3(cid:105)e that share the eigenvalue
E3 = 9. The transitions |3, 1(cid:105)e ↔ |3, 3(cid:105)e are regulated by an intermediary state 1√
(|0(cid:105)2 + e−iχ|1(cid:105)2) of
undeﬁned energy but deﬁnite orbital angular momentum ((cid:96) = 2). The same diagram corresponds to
the transitions |0(cid:105)2 ↔ |1(cid:105)2, these last regulated by an intermediary state |3, e−iφ(cid:105)P of undeﬁned orbital
angular momentum but deﬁnite energy. Compare with Figure 14.

3.3.1 Dicke-like states

We have seen that the transitions between the physical states of the 2-dimensional hierar-
chies E2 and E3 require an intermediary state of undeﬁned energy. Thus, the transitions
H(cid:96) → H(cid:96)±1, (cid:96) = 1, 2, allowed by the intertwining relationships deﬁned in the previous
sections, demand a representation space bigger than H(2). Indeed, the four cases discussed
above are diﬀerent representation spaces of dimension 3 for the SU (2) group. All of them
correspond to the angular momentum that is deﬁned by the highest weight jDk = 1, this
last justiﬁes the notation |jDk, µDk(cid:105)Dk, with µDk = 1, 0,−1, and k = 1, 2, 3, 4.

27

Intertwining between the deﬁnite energy states |4, 0(cid:105)e, |4, 2(cid:105)e and |4, 4(cid:105)e that share the
Figure 16:
eigenvalue E4 = 11. The transitions between these vectors are regulated by the intermediary states
|2, k(cid:105)D1, k = 1, 0,−1. The same diagram corresponds to the transitions between the states indicated at
the right column of the ﬁgure.

In general, given any En-hierarchy, one has

(cid:40) n/2,

jDk =

n even
(n − 1)/2, n odd

(147)

Then, we can construct a representation space HD
ing the steps indicated in Section 3.2.1. As an example consider the diagram shown in
Figure 16, where we have omitted the representation of the corresponding ladder opera-
tors. The E4-hierarchy is spanned by the orthonormal basis |4, (cid:96)(cid:105)e, with (cid:96) = 0, 2, 4. We
have three possible transitions:

(2jD+1) of vectors |jDk, µDk(cid:105)Dk by follow-

|4, 0(cid:105)e ↔ |4, 2(cid:105)e,

|4, 2(cid:105)e ↔ |4, 4(cid:105)e,

|4, 0(cid:105)e ↔ |4, 4(cid:105)e.

The ﬁrst two require only one intermediary state, that is,

|4, 0(cid:105)e ↔ |2, 1(cid:105)D1 ↔ |4, 2(cid:105)e,

|4, 2(cid:105)e ↔ |2,−1(cid:105)D1 ↔ |4, 4(cid:105)e,

where

|2, 1(cid:105)D1 = 1√

2

(|3, 1(cid:105)e + |5, 1(cid:105)e),

|2,−1(cid:105)D1 = 1√

2

(|3, 3(cid:105)e + |5, 3(cid:105)e).

(148)

(149)

(150)

The third transition in (148) requires these last two intermediary states and a third one:

|2, 0(cid:105)D1 = 1√

(|2, 2(cid:105)e + |4, 2(cid:105)e + |6, 2(cid:105)e).

(151)
The identiﬁcation |4, 0(cid:105)e = |2, 2(cid:105)D1, |4, 4(cid:105)e = |2,−2(cid:105)D1 completes the basis |jD1, µD1(cid:105)D1
for jD1 = 2. A second representation is obtained by considering the transitions |6, 2(cid:105)e ↔
|2, 2(cid:105)e indicated at the right column of Figure 16. In addition, other two representations
of dimension 5 are associated with the E5-hierarchy.

3

As in the previous cases, the representation of the generators of the su(2) Lie algebra

is constructed by using the Hubbard operators

X p,q
nk

:= |jDk, jDk − p + 1(cid:105)Dk(cid:104)jDk, jDk − q + 1|, nk = 2jDk + 1.

J D− = (J D

On the other hand, we say that the vectors |jDk, µDk(cid:105)Dk are Dicke-like states in resem-
blance with the permutation invariant states that describe a system of n qubits with k
elements in the excited state [22]. In the canonical basis, the Dicke states are of the form

(154)

The sum is accomplished over all the permutations of qubits and Sn denotes the symmetric
group of order n. These states constitute an irreducible representation of SU (2) deﬁned
by the so called collective operators:

n(cid:88)

n(cid:88)

ˆJ3 =

σ(i)
3 ,

ˆJ± =

σ(i)± ,

(155)

i=1

i=1

with σ(i)
3,± acting on the ith qubit. Although our model is mono-partite and the Dicke
states are deﬁned for multi-partite systems, the following analogy can be established.
The vectors |jDk, µDk(cid:105)Dk are either states of deﬁnite angular momentum (horizontal blue
expressions in Figures 14, 15 and 16) or states of deﬁnite energy (vertical blue expressions
in the above quoted ﬁgures) likewise to the fact that the Dicke vectors are states of deﬁnite
number of excitations. Therefore, we can consider a multi-qubit system as follows.

Figure 14 is also the representation of two qubits, the ﬁrst one is of deﬁnite orbital
quantum number (cid:96) = 1 and admits only one of two possible values of the energy, E3 and
E1 (the zero of the energy is at E2). The second qubit is of deﬁnite energy E2 = 7 and
admits only one of two possible values of the orbital quantum number, (cid:96) = 0 and (cid:96) = 2
(the zero is at (cid:96) = 1). Thus, the diagram shown in Figure 14 corresponds to a bi-partite
qubit system of radial oscillators S = SA + SB, where SA is characterized by the energy
and SB by the orbital quantum number. In the canonical basis we can write |3, 1(cid:105)e = |0(cid:105)A,
|1, 1(cid:105)e = |1(cid:105)A, |2, 0(cid:105)e = |1(cid:105)B, and |2, 2(cid:105)e = |0(cid:105)B. Then, the most general state of the full
system S acquires the form

|Ψ(cid:105) = a|0(cid:105)A ⊗ |0(cid:105)B + b|0(cid:105)A ⊗ |1(cid:105)B + c|1(cid:105)A ⊗ |0(cid:105)B + d|1(cid:105)A ⊗ |1(cid:105)B

= a|3, 1(cid:105)e ⊗ |2, 2(cid:105)e + b|3, 1(cid:105)e ⊗ |2, 0(cid:105)e + c|1, 1(cid:105)e ⊗ |2, 2(cid:105)e + d|1, 1(cid:105)e ⊗ |2, 0(cid:105)e,

(156)

where a, b, c and d are such that |Ψ(cid:105) is normalized. The concurrence C(|Ψ(cid:105)) = 2|ad − bc|,
0 ≤ C ≤ 1, is a measure of the entanglement [23] between the two radial oscillators
SA,B. For instance, taking c = d = 0 we have C = 0 (unentangled) while for a = d = 0,
b = c = 1√
, we have C = 1 (fully entanglement). Applying the appropriate interactions
the transitions showed in Figure 14 should correspond to the coherences of the related
density operator (see, e.g. [24–26]). Other possibility for the intermediary states is to take

2

29

them in correspondence with the coherent and squeezed states discussed in the previous
section. Further details will be reported elsewhere.

A similar description is true for the elements in Figure 15. For vector spaces HD

(2jD+1)
of higher dimension (as the one associated with Figure 16), the number of qubits increases
as the value of jDk.

4 Spectrum generating algebra of ‘diagonal’ hierar-

chies

In the previous sections we have shown that su(1, 1) and su(2) are the spectrum gener-
ating algebras of the deﬁnite angular momentum hierarchies H(cid:96) and the deﬁnite energy
hierarchies H(n) respectively. Such algebras are deﬁned by the ladder operators A(cid:96), A
†
(cid:96), B(cid:96)
†
and B
(cid:96) , that modify the radial quantum number s in either vertical or horizontal form,
see Figure 17. There is, however, an additional set of ﬁnite-dimensional spaces spanned by
the vectors that are intertwined in diagonal form. These last are connected by diagonal
red arrows in Figure 17. The boson operators a± deﬁned in (29)–(32) seem to be the
natural option to produce such an intertwining. Indeed, we introduce the operators C3
and C± as

C3 = 1

2(2Ns − N(cid:96) + 1

2), C− =

N(cid:96) − Ns − 1

N(cid:96) − Ns − 1
2.

(cid:113)

2 a−, C+ = a+(cid:113)

(cid:115)

30

(157)

(158)

(159)

They span the Lie algebra of SU (2) because satisfy the commutation rules

[C3, C±] = ±C±,

[C−, C+] = −2C3.

The action of this new set of operators on the vectors |s, (cid:96)(cid:105) is given by

C−|s, (cid:96)(cid:105) =(cid:112)s((cid:96) + 1) |s − 1, (cid:96) + 1(cid:105), C+|s, (cid:96)(cid:105) =(cid:112)(s + 1)(cid:96) |s + 1, (cid:96) − 1(cid:105),

2(s − (cid:96))|s, (cid:96)(cid:105),

C3|s, (cid:96)(cid:105) = 1

with C−|0, (cid:96)(cid:105) = 0 and C+|s, 0(cid:105) = 0, as desired.
In other words, following the steps
indicated in Section 3.2.1, |ϕlow(cid:105) = |0, (cid:96)(cid:105) and |ϕhig(cid:105) = |s, 0(cid:105) are the extremal vectors that
we require to get a ﬁnite representation of SU (2). The highest weight of the eigenvalue
µC = 1
2s. This
last means that the representation will be determined by the even values of the principal
quantum number because, for (cid:96) = 0, we have n = 2s with s a nonnegative integer (see
the energy levels connected by red arrows in Figure 17). In this form,

2(s − (cid:96)) is reached for the lowest orbital angular momentum, that is jC = 1

C k−|ϕhigh(cid:105) = C k−|s, 0(cid:105) =

Γ(s + 1)Γ(k + 1)

Γ(s − k + 1)

|s − k, k(cid:105).

†
operators A(cid:96) and A
(cid:96), black–vertical arrows, operate in a speciﬁc (cid:96)-hierarchy of state vectors by annihilat-
ing and creating the radial quantum number s respectively. In turn, the energy deﬁnite ladder operators
†
(cid:96) , blue–horizontal arrows, operate in a speciﬁc En-hierarchy of state vectors by annihilating and
B(cid:96) and B
†
creating the radial quantum number s respectively. A third type of ladder operators, namely C(cid:96) and C
(cid:96) ,
operate in the ﬁnite–dimensional subspaces spanned by the vectors belonging to the ‘diagonal’ energy
levels, as indicated by the red–diagonal arrows.

In particular, for k = s we have C s−|s, 0(cid:105) = Γ(s + 1)|0, s(cid:105), so that C s+1− |s, 0(cid:105) = 0. In other
words, the dimension of the representation is dC = 2jC + 1 = s + 1. Thus, for jC ﬁxed,
the vectors

|s, (cid:96)(cid:105) = |2jC, 2(jC − µC)(cid:105) ≡ |j, µ(cid:105)C, µC = jC − 1
2(cid:96),

(cid:96) = 0, 1, . . . , s,

(161)

are eigenstates of C3 with eigenvalue µC. In such a representation we have

C3|j, µ(cid:105)C = µC|j, µ(cid:105)C,

C−|j, µ(cid:105)C =(cid:112)(jC + µC)(jC − µC + 1)|j, µ − 1(cid:105)C,
C+|j, µ(cid:105)C =(cid:112)(jC − µC)(jC + µC + 1)|j, µ + 1(cid:105)C.

The full space of states of the radial oscillator decomposes into the direct sum(cid:76)∞

where the ‘diagonal’ subspaces are deﬁned as HdC = {|s, (cid:96)(cid:105), s + (cid:96) = 2jC}.

(162)

dC =1 HdC ,

The construction of the SU (2) coherent states can be accomplished as in the previous
cases. These have properties similar to the ones discussed for the states of Section 3.2.2.
To conclude this section let us emphasize that the operator multiplying a± in the

deﬁnition of C± acts on the elements of HdC as follows

(N(cid:96) − Ns − 1

2)|s, (cid:96)(cid:105) ≡ ˆ(cid:96)op|s, (cid:96)(cid:105) = (cid:96)|s, (cid:96)(cid:105).

(163)

Hence, for (cid:96) (cid:54)= 0, we can write

C3 =

1

2ˆκop

(ˆκopNs − I) , C− =

1(cid:112)−ˆκop

a−, C+ = a+

1(cid:112)−ˆκop

,

ˆκop = − 1
ˆ(cid:96)op

.

(164)

Quite recently, in connection with the generalized oscillator algebra reported in [30], a
similar set of operators (with a negative number κ instead of the operator ˆκop) has been

31

introduced in [31]. There, the authors show that the parameter κ deﬁnes the dimension
of the representation d = 1 − 1/κ and gives rise to a phase factor in the relations (162).
This last is then shown to be essential in generating mutually unbiased bases.
In our
case, the algebra spanned by C3 and C± is deﬁned in a vector space integrated by states
of the radial oscillator that diﬀer in angular momentum and energy as well, so that
the operator ˆκop cannot be substituted by a number that is common to all the vectors
|s, (cid:96)(cid:105).
Indeed, the basis elements of HdC are eigenvectors of ˆκop with non-degenerate
eigenvalue 0 > κ = −1/(cid:96). Notice however that |ϕlow(cid:105) = |0, (cid:96)(cid:105) is eigenvector of ˆκop
with eigenvalue −1/(cid:96). This last deﬁnes the dimension of the representation because
dC = 1 − 1/κ = 1 + (cid:96) = 1 + 2jC. Further insights on the matter will be reported
elsewhere.

5 Conclusions

We have used the factorization method to show that each of the Lie algebras su(1, 1) and
su(2) determine the energy spectrum of the radial oscillator. Accordingly, the space of
states H of the radial oscillator decomposes into the following direct sums:

κ=3/4 Hκ, with Hκ the inﬁnite-dimensional hierarchies H(cid:96) deﬁned in Section 2
4(2(cid:96) + 3) = 1
4(cid:96) the Bargmann index characterizing each ‘vertical’ subspace

and κ = 1
Hκ as a representation space of the noncompact Lie group SU (1, 1).

a) H =(cid:76)∞
b) H = (cid:76)∞
c) H =(cid:76)∞

n=0 H(n), where the ‘horizontal’ subspaces H(n) are the ﬁnite-dimensional
hierarchies deﬁned in Section 2, each one a representation space of the compact Lie
group SU (2). The standard angular momentum basis |j, µ(cid:105)J ↔ |n, (cid:96)(cid:105)e is introduced
the highest weight of µ and d the dimension of H(n).
in (117)–(119), with j = d−1
dC =1 HdC , where each ‘diagonal’ subspace HdC = {|s, (cid:96)(cid:105), s + (cid:96) = 2jC} is a
representation of SU (2). Here dC = 2jC + 1 is the dimension of the representation
and jC is the highest weight of µC.

2

d) Besides the representations (b–c), we have constructed diverse ﬁnite-dimensional

2jd+1 of SU (2) that are spanned by the Dicke-like states |jDk, µDk(cid:105)Dk

representations HD
introduced in Section 3.3.1.

The emphasis of this work is on SU (2) as the generating group of the radial oscilla-
tor because the ﬁnite-dimensional representation spaces (b–d) have been unnoticed in
the literature on the matter. Another relevant point in our approach is the two-boson
(Schwinger) proﬁle of the generators of su(1, 1) and su(2) that arises as a natural con-
sequence of applying the factorization method on the radial oscillator Hamiltonian. On
the one hand, this Schwinger structure justiﬁes the squeezing observed in the quadrature
variances of the coherent states for both generating groups, SU (1, 1) and SU (2). On the
other hand, the Schwinger proﬁle is a necessity originated by the allowed transitions of the

32

system. These last properties of the representation theory associated to the generating
algebras for the radial oscillator have been not previously reported in the literature.

We have also shown that the majority of the coherent states constructed here are
squeezed for the quadratures under the criterion of Wodkiewicz and Eberly [13]. In par-
ticular, for the SU (2) Perelomov coherent states constructed in Section 3.2.2, the squeez-
ing depends on the complex parameter z = |z|e−iφ that labels the linear combination of
deﬁnite energy states. For any value of |z| and φ in the vicinity of the points φn = n π
2 ,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., the squeezing alternates between the two quadratures of the system. The
points φn deﬁne minimum uncertainty states and the neighbourhoods of φ = π
4 , . . .,
are such that the variances of both quadratures are bigger than the average uncertainty.
These classical-to-quantum and quantum-to-classical transitions deserve special attention
because they can be controlled by manipulating the phase of z ∈ C.

4 , 3π

In the literature [32] one can ﬁnd discussions addressed to motivate the searching of
states that satisfy squeezing conditions diﬀerent from the ones of the Wodkiewicz-Eberly
criterion. The main criticism is that for the SU (1, 1) coherent states the variances are
greater than their value in the ground state. This is certainly true for the states of
Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 (see e.g. Figures 5 and 10). However, this is not the case for the
SU (2) coherent states of Section 3.2.2 because the classical-to-quantum and quantum-to-
classical transitions do not depend on the ground state of the system (see Figure 13). The
same holds for the other representations of SU (2) reported in this work. We hope that
our results will be useful in the studies on the matter.

Some applications could be found in quantum optics, where the Laguerre-Gaussian
modes are useful in ﬁnding out the role of the shape in the quality of light beams [33],
and in the comparison of the propagation of light in uniaxial crystals with the propagation
in isotropic media [34]. The Gouy phase (one of the photon geometrical phases) has been
observed through quantum correlations in Laguerre-Gaussian modes [35], the experiment
was based on the relative phase of two diﬀerent modes. The prospects discussed in
Section 3.3.1 for the Dicke-like states are addressed in this last direction.

must be satisﬁed. We would like to emphasise that (A-22) includes the same (cid:96)-index
for both u-functions because (A-16) is already fulﬁlled. That is, the product of two u-
functions with diﬀerent (cid:96)-index would be diﬀerent from zero even-though they are labelled
with diﬀerent n-indices. Notice however that the integral of u∗
n(cid:96)(r)un(cid:48)(cid:96)(cid:48)(r) must be ﬁnite
in general, otherwise the product (A-21) is not necessarily zero for (cid:96) (cid:54)= (cid:96)(cid:48).

In this work we pay attention to the states |n, (cid:96)(cid:105) for which the following orthogonality

condition is satisﬁed

δnn(cid:48)δ(cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:48) = (cid:104)n, (cid:96)|n(cid:48), (cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:105) =

Remark that the Θ-functions have the same m-index because (A-16) is already fulﬁlled.
That is, the product (A-23) makes sense only for a given value of the z-projection of the
involved orbital angular momenta. As m = 0 is included for any value of (cid:96), without loss
of generality we take this as the deﬁnite value of m. In this form the product (A-23) is
indeed twice indexed. Then, we can rewrite the position representation of the states |n(cid:105)
and |(cid:96)(cid:105) associated with the eigenvalue equation (A-19) as follows
(cid:104)(cid:96)|θ(cid:105) ≡ Θ(cid:96),m=0(θ).

(cid:104)r|n(cid:105) ≡ un(cid:96)(r),

(A-24)

Bearing in mind this last simpliﬁed representation, the radial eigenvalue equation (A-19)
is expressed as

H(cid:96)|n, (cid:96)(cid:105) = 2λEn|n, (cid:96)(cid:105), H(cid:96) = − d2

Finally, the transformation from the second order linear diﬀerential equation (A-19) to
the conﬂuent hypergeometric one [14] leads to the general form of the u-fnctions (γ and
