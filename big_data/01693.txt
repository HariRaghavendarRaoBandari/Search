Dessins on Modular Curves

Khashayar Filom∗ Ali Kamalinejad†

Abstract

Given a ﬁnite index subgroup Γ of PSL2(Z), we investigate Belyi functions on
the corresponding modular curve X(Γ) by introducing two methods for constructing
such functions. Numerous examples have been worked out completely and as an
application, we have derived modular equations for Γ0(2), Γ0(3) and several special
values of the j-function by a new method based on the theory of Belyi functions and
dessin d’enfants.

Introduction

It is an elementary fact that in the action of Γ(1) = SL2(Z) on the upper half plane H,
πi
there are two elliptic orbits, that of i and e
3 . So for any ﬁnite index subgroup Γ of Γ(1)
the ﬁnite ramiﬁed cover Γ\H → Γ(1)\H after compactiﬁcation give rises to a morphism
from the compact Riemann surfaces associated with Γ to the compactiﬁcation of Γ(1)\H
3 along with Γ(1).∞. On
with at most three critical values which are Γ(1).i and Γ(1).e
the other hand, the j-function establishes an isomorphism from the compactiﬁcation of
Γ(1)\H to CP1. Therefore, the aforementioned morphism of compact Riemann surfaces
can be realized as a Belyi function.
The purpose of this paper is to show how dessin theory can be an eﬀective tool in compu-
tational problems in modular curves. More speciﬁcally, it allows the explicit computation
of modular equations, the determination of certain special values of j-function and pro-
vides explicit examples of ramiﬁed coverings of algebraic curves.
In particular, in the
case of isogenies of elliptic curves, these examples lead to identities for the Weierstrass ℘-
functions, for instance in Remark 3, that appear to be new.

Examples of calculations of the Belyi function and the dessin d’enfant associated with
a congruence subgroup have appeared before in literature e.g.
in [3],[8] for the case of
genus zero torsion-free congruence subgroups. We will investigate some of the congruence
subgroups which possess torsion elements for instance in Examples 7, 8 and furthermore
few subgroups of higher genera in Examples 3, 5 and 10. Moreover, a second method for
constructing Belyi functions on modular curves is introduced in section 3 the advantage
of which is a simple description of the monodromy representation (see section 3 for the
deﬁnition). The ﬁnal section is devoted to applications in computing the modular equa-
tions and some special j-values.
For notations we mainly follow [9] which is our primary reference on modular functions
and modular curves. H∗ := H ∪ Q ∪ {∞} denotes the upper half plane union cusps for
Γ(1). Γ(N ) is the principal congruence subgroup of level N and Γ0(N ) is the subgroup of
with c ≡ 0 (mod N ). Γ always indicates a
Γ(1) = SL2(Z) consisting of matrices
ﬁnite index subgroup of Γ(1). We denote the compact Riemann surface Γ\H∗ by X(Γ).
πi
For Γ = Γ(N ) or Γ0(N ), notations X(N ) and X0(N ) are used instead. The point e
3 of
the upper half plane is denoted by ρ and [z] means the orbit of z ∈ H under the action
of Γ and also the corresponding point in X(Γ). Finally, ¯Γ is the image of Γ ≤ SL2(Z) in
¯Γ(1) = PSL2(Z) ⊂ Aut(H) and we will work with M¨obius transformations T : z (cid:55)→ z + 1
and S : z (cid:55)→ −1
set of generators for PSL2(Z).

2 First Construction

Let us analyze the ramiﬁcation structure of the map X(Γ) = Γ\H∗ → X(1) = Γ(1)\H∗.
The commutative diagram below

H

Γ\H

/ Γ(1)\H

and the fact that in the action of ¯Γ(1) on H points with non-trivial stabilizer are exactly
the elements of orbits Γ(1).ρ or Γ(1).i with stabilizers of orders three and two respectively,
indicates that critical values of the map Γ\H → Γ(1)\H obtained from its restriction are
among [ρ], [i] ∈ H. Moreover, point [z] ∈ Γ\H where z ∈ Γ(1).ρ (resp. z ∈ Γ(1).i) is a
critical point of this map iﬀ z is not an elliptic point of Γ and in that case, multiplicity

of this point is three (resp. two). The only other critical value that Γ\H∗ → Γ(1)\H∗
may possess is [∞] whose ﬁber is the set of orbits of cusps for Γ. Hence Γ\H∗ → Γ(1)\H∗
is a Belyi function provided one identiﬁes X(1) = Γ(1)\H∗ with CP1 in a way that the
subset containing two elliptic orbits (points [ρ], [i] ∈ X(1)) and one orbit of cusps (point
[∞] ∈ X(1)) bijects to {0, 1,∞}. The modular function j : H → C gives us such an
identiﬁcation since it has a simple pole at inﬁnity and satisﬁes j(ρ) = 0 and j(i) = 1728.
Thus, for any Γ, the function 1

1728 j : X(Γ) = Γ\H∗ → CP1 is Belyi:

Proposition 1. Let Γ be a ﬁnite index subgroup of Γ(1). Then

f : X(Γ) = Γ\H∗ → CP1

1728 j(z)

is a Belyi function of degree m := [¯Γ(1) : ¯Γ] whose black (resp. white) vertices are Γ-orbits
of points in Γ(1).ρ (resp. Γ(1).i) and centers of faces (× vertices) are orbits of cusps of Γ.
If ν3 (resp. ν2) and ν∞ indicate the number of inequivalent elliptic points of order three
(resp. two) and the number of inequivalent cusps for Γ respectively, then the dessin has
ν∞ faces and among its black (resp. white) vertices, there are m−ν3
) vertices
of degree three (resp. two) and the rest, i.e. ν3 (resp. ν2) remaining black (resp. white)
vertices, are all of degree one1. Furthermore, the number of edges of the face surrounding
a vertex [z] of type × where z ∈ Q ∪ {∞} is twice the width of the cusp z of Γ.

This description of degrees of vertices of various kinds in our dessin certainly does not
need to specify isomorphism class of the corresponding Belyi function since there is still
the question of the way the graph is embedded on the underlying topological surface.
This deﬁciency is remedied in the second method for constructing Belyi functions on
modular curves introduced in the next section where in certain cases the monodromy of
Belyi function can be recovered from the corresponding subgroup of Γ(1). Nevertheless,
symmetries stemming from the group action always can be used to determine the dessin.
In particular, when Γ(cid:69) Γ(1) the well-deﬁned transitive left action of Γ(1) on Γ\H∗ implies
that the deck transformation group of the Belyi function Γ\H∗ → Γ(1)\H∗ ∼= CP1 may
be identiﬁed with ¯Γ(1)/¯Γ. Consequently, this ramiﬁed covering is regular, our dessin is
uniform (degrees of vertices of the same type coincide.) and ¯Γ(1)/¯Γ is actually a group of
symmetries of the dessin. Exploiting these symmetries extremely simpliﬁes calculations
with dessins as we shall see in examples.

Corollary 1. In examples of this section, we mainly deal with principal congruence sub-
groups Γ(N ) where N > 1. Since they do not have any elliptic point, according to 1, in
their dessins, •,◦,× vertices are of degrees 2, 3, N respectively. The genus of X(N ) is

Remark 1. Although as mentioned before the mere description of dessin’s degree se-
quence in 1 is not suﬃcient to determine the corresponding Belyi function X(Γ) → CP1,
it might be enough to determine the complex structure of the compact Riemann surface
X(Γ) provided that this degree sequence speciﬁes the underlying graph of the dessin up
to isomorphism. This is due to a simple observation: various embeddings of a bipartite
graph as a dessin on a ﬁxed oriented topological surface all lead to the same complex
structure. The reason is that diﬀerent embeddings diﬀer by an orientation preserving
self-homeomorphism of the surface. Such a homeomorphism respects two triangulations
of the surface obtained from these embeddings and thus respects complex structures on
the surface induced by these triangulations. There are some relevant cases where the un-
derlying graph may be uniquely determined, e.g. when the dessin is uniform. To see this,
note that since each white vertex is of degree two, the dessin is obtained from a graph
with black vertices by putting one white vertex on each edge2. This is a 3-regular graph
embedded (as a map) on a topological surface where every face has the same number of
edges and the number of vertices, edges and faces are prescribed by Γ. Clearly such a
graph is unique up to isomorphism.

Example 1. For our ﬁrst example, consider the index six normal subgroup Γ(2). Since
µ2 = 6, Corollary 1 implies that the genus of X(2) is zero, there are µ2 = 6 edges, µ2
3 = 2
black vertices each of degree three, µ2
2 = 3 white vertices each of degree two and µ2
N = 3
faces each with 2N = 4 edges. Thus, the dessin is an embedding of the graph K2,3 on
∼=→ S3 in which cosets of S and T are
(cid:3) = −1 the Belyi function f : X(2) → X(1) ∼= CP1 (along with its
the sphere. There is an isomorphism ¯Γ(1)/¯Γ(2)
mapped to transpositions. Using these symmetries, after ﬁxing three white vertices by

We may also explicitly describe the group Deck(cid:0)f : CP1 → CP1(cid:1) ∼= S3 as the group gen-

2In literature dessins of this kind are called clean. It follows from Proposition 1 that the dessin on X(Γ)
is clean provided that Γ does not have any elliptic point of order two, e.g. in the case of Γ = Γ(N ) when
N ≥ 2 or Γ0(N ) when −1 is not a quadratic residue modulo N .

Remark 2. Although irrelevant in the previous example, it might seem ambiguous how
one should connect black and white vertices in the dessin on X(Γ). Note that in the
identiﬁcation of X(1) with CP1 in Proposition 1 via a multiple of j-invariant, the arc

(cid:8)z ∈ H(cid:12)(cid:12)|z| = 1, 0 ≤ R(z) ≤ 1

there is a general method discussed in [3] for drawing the underlying graph of the dessin
by relating it to the Schreier coset graph associated with the subgroup Γ of PSL2(Z).

Example 2. In this example, we concentrate on the principal congruence subgroup Γ(3)

and the corresponding Belyi function f : X(3) → X(1) ∼= CP1 where N = 3, µ3 = 12.
So by Corollary 1, the corresponding dessin has twelve edges, four black vertices each
of degree three, six white vertices each of degree two and four faces (× vertices) each
surrounded with six edges. The deck transformation group ¯Γ(1)/¯Γ(3) is isomorphic to
the alternating group A4 by the map which sends cosets of T and S to a 3-cycle and
a product of two disjoint transpositions in A4. The description (Z2 × Z2) (cid:111) Z3 of the
group A4 as a semidirect product of the subgroup of order two elements by a subgroup
generated by an order three element (like T ’s) coset indicates that in terms of S and T a
set of representatives may be described as:

{I2, S, T ST −1, T 2ST −2, T, T S, T 2ST −1, ST −2, T 2, T 2S, ST −1, T ST −2}

(2)
3The degree six meromorphic function on the Riemann sphere obtained as Γ(2)\H∗ → Γ(1)\H∗ is in
fact up to a constant factor isomorphic to the formula of the j-invariant of an elliptic curve in its Legendre
form given by λ (cid:55)→ 256 (λ2−λ+1)3

(λ2−λ)2 , cf. page 267 of [2].

With applying them to points ρ, i,∞ of H∗, one can easily compute the Γ(3)-orbits that
form the set of vertices and then Remark 2 enables us to draw the underlying graph of
our dessin on X(3) ∼= CP1 as in Figure 2.

Example 3. Let us consider N = 6 and examine the Belyi function f : X(6) → X(1) ∼=
CP1 which is of degree µ6 = 72, corresponding to a dessin on the torus with 72 edges,
24 black vertices of degree three, 36 white vertices of degree two and 12 faces each with
2N = 12 edges. It factorizes as

X(6) = Γ(6)\H∗ 6-sheeted−→ X(3) = Γ(3)\H∗ ∼= CP1 12-sheeted−→ Γ(1)\H∗ ∼= CP1

where the latter map is the Belyi function studied in Example 2. We will concentrate on
the former which expresses a genus one Riemann surface as a 6-fold ramiﬁed cover of CP1.
Critical values of ˜f : X(6) = Γ(6)\H∗ → X(3) = Γ(3)\H∗ are the points corresponding to
cusps of Γ(3), that are [0], [1], [2], [∞] ∈ X(3) and the ﬁber above each has precisely three
points all of multiplicity two. The deck transformation group is a version of S3 generated by
order two and three automorphisms of X(6) = Γ(6)\H∗ induced respectively by left actions
. We will employ them to construct factorizations of ˜f that not only will

applying the Riemann-Hurwitz formula: in any factorization X(6) 2-sheeted−→ Y 3-sheeted−→ X(3)

isogeny between these elliptic curves. By diagram chasing one deduces that the degree
three map h : CP1 → CP1 has exactly four critical values which form the set of the critical
values of both ˜f and right column of (6). Moreover, h’s ﬁber over any of them consists of a
point of multiplicity two and a simple point. These simple points of h over its critical values
are the critical values of the left column. Identifying the modular curve X(3) with the
Riemann sphere just like Example 2, the coordinate of cusps or in the other word critical
values of ˜f : X(6) → X(3) are: [∞] = ∞, [0] = 1, [1] = e

the curve in the top right corner of the diagram (6) is y2 = x3−1 and we will ﬁnd the other

properties. It attains the value 1 at points −2, 1 where the latter is simple and due to the

In our second construction, we assume Γ to be a ﬁnite index subgroup of Γ(2) instead of
Γ(1) = PSL2(Z). It is no loss of generality as the Belyi theorem implies that arithmetic
Riemann surfaces are exactly those containing a proper Zariski open subset uniformised
by a ﬁnite index subgroup of Γ(2). This is due to a key observation: H → Γ(2)\H is a
universal covering since Γ(2) does not possess any elliptic element and on the other hand
Γ(2)\H may be identiﬁed with C − {0, 1} because it is the complement of cusps’ orbits in
X(2) = Γ(2)\H∗ ∼= CP1 while the number of inequivalent cusps for Γ(2) is exactly three:

(8)
So in this section, we ﬁx an isomorphism from X(2) to CP1 which takes points [0], [1], [∞] ∈
Γ(2)\H∗ to 0, 1,∞ ∈ CP1 respectively. Then for any ﬁnite index subgroup Γ of Γ(2), the

The main advantage of working with this Belyi function rather than X(Γ) → X(1) ∼= CP1
the monodromy homomorphism of X(Γ) → X(2) ∼= CP1, which speciﬁes the isomorphism
class of the Belyi function, may be investigated via knowledge of the subgroup Γ as we
shall explain. Away from the set {[0], [1], [∞]} containing its critical values, X(Γ) → X(2)
restricts to Γ\H → Γ(2)\H which is an intermediate cover of the universal cover H →
Γ(2)\H7. Thus, ¯Γ(2) = Γ(2)/{±I2}, which acts freely on H, can be identiﬁed with the
rank two free group π1

(cid:0)Γ(2)\H ∼= C − {0, 1}(cid:1) and this intermediate cover corresponds to

(cid:0)C − {0, 1}(cid:1), it is a standard fact that the monodromy homomorphism is determined

The monodromy is a homomorphism from this rank two free group to the permutations
of a regular ﬁber.
In general, given a Belyi function, ﬁxing a basis for the free group
π1
with a pair of permutations of a regular ﬁber that generate a transitive subgroup and such
pairs modulo conjugation by the same permutation are in a one-to-one correspondence with
isomorphism classes of Belyi functions. See [2] for more details and also a very concrete
description of the monodromy of a Belyi function in terms of its dessin. Here, as the left
action ¯Γ(2) on H is free, ﬁbers may be identiﬁed with the set of right cosets of ¯Γ in ¯Γ(2):
points above [x] ∈ Γ(2)\H are precisely [β1.x], . . . , [βm.x] ∈ Γ\H where {β1, . . . , βm} is a set
of right coset representatives of ¯Γ in ¯Γ(2). Let us analyze the monodromy homomorphism.
A fundamental domain for Γ(2) is depicted in Figure 4 as union of six fundamental domains
for Γ(1) = SL2(Z). Two arcs and the segment which are bolded in the ﬁgure provide us

circular arc from ρ to ρ + 1 we will get a small counterclockwise loop in the punctured

(cid:0)Γ(2)\H, [ρ − 1](cid:1) consisting of these two homotopy classes, it is easy to describe

for π1
the monodromy homomorphism from π1
elements of Γ\H → Γ(2)\H’s ﬁber above [ρ − 1]. Since the endpoints of the liftings to the
universal cover H just constructed satisfy ρ + 1 = T 2(ρ − 1) and ρ − 1 = ST 2S−1(ν), we
conclude that the corresponding two permutations on the ﬁber above [ρ − 1], identiﬁed
with the set of right cosets of ¯Γ in ¯Γ(2), are those induced by multiplication at T 2 and
ST 2S−1 from right8. This discussion proves:

Proposition 2. Let Γ be a ﬁnite index subgroup of Γ(2). Then the obvious map

f : X(Γ) = Γ\H∗ → X(2) = Γ(2)\H∗ ∼= CP1

where X(2) is identiﬁed with CP1 in the way that [0] (cid:55)→ 0, [1] (cid:55)→ 1 and [∞] (cid:55)→ ∞, is a Belyi
function of degree m := [¯Γ(2) : ¯Γ]. In its dessin black, white and vertices corresponding
to faces are Γ-orbits of points in Γ(2).0, Γ(2).1 and Γ(2).∞ respectively. The number of
edges is m and the degree of a vertex [z] ∈ X(Γ) is half the width of the cusp z ∈ Q∪{∞}
of Γ. Moreover, the monodromy is given by two permutations of the set of right cosets of
¯Γ in ¯Γ(2) induced by the right actions of T 2 and ST 2S−1.

When Γ(cid:69) Γ(2), the Belyi function is regular and its dessin is uniform and by 9 the number
of •,◦ or × vertices are respectively the number of Γ-orbits that subsets Γ(2).0, Γ(2).1 or
Γ(2).∞ of Q∗ = Q ∪ {∞} decompose to. Using normality, this number is easy to ﬁnd: it
only suﬃces to consider the index in ¯Γ(2) of the subgroup generated by ¯Γ and stabilizers
of 0, 1 or ∞ in the action of ¯Γ(2):

Corollary 2. Suppose Γ is a ﬁnite index normal subgroup of Γ(2). Then the Belyi function
f : X(Γ) → X(2) from Proposition 2 is regular. Put:

m =(cid:2)¯Γ(2) : ¯Γ(cid:3)

8Equivalently, having in mind the way we identiﬁed X(2) with CP1 and following notations of [2], in
the permutation representation (σ0, σ1, σ∞) (where σ0σ1σ∞ = 1) of the Belyi function X(Γ) → X(2) ∼=
CP1, σ0 is the permutation induced by multiplication at ST 2S−1 and σ∞ is the permutation induced by
multiplication at T 2.

The monodromy representation of this degree m Belyi function f is given by two permu-
tations of Sm induced by the right actions T 2 and ST 2S−1 on the underlying set of the
order m group ¯Γ(2)/¯Γ.

Considering the case of principal congruence subgroups Γ(2N ) which are normal in Γ(1)
while contained in Γ(2), preceding corollary indicates that:

For the dessin on X(2N ) constructed in Proposition 2, the number of edges of the dessin

Example 4. Let N = 2. According to Corollary 3 the Belyi function f : X(4) ∼= CP1 →
X(2) ∼= CP1 is of degree four and in its dessin every vertex is of degree two. The quotient
group ¯Γ(2)/¯Γ(4) is isomorphic to to the Klein four-group. Corollary 3 implies that the
monodromy homomorphism is speciﬁed by a pair of permutations on the set of elements
of Klein group induced by multiplication at two non-trivial elements of this group. So
after an arbitrary labeling of four edges, monodromy is given by two distinct elements of
the symmetric group S4 each a product of two disjoint transpositions, e.g. (1 2)(3 4) and
(1 4)(2 3). The complete picture of the dessin is illustrated in the Figure 5 which (after
arbitrarily ﬁxing three vertices) immediately yields the formula of the Belyi function f :

Example 5. Here we sketch a similar analysis for the case of N = 4 in Corollary 3 where
we have the Belyi function f : X(8) → X(2) ∼= CP1 of degree 4
3 µ4 = 32 on the Riemann
surface X(8) of genus ﬁve. This Belyi function has exactly 32
4 = 8 critical points all of mul-
tiplicity N = 4 in each of its critical ﬁbers. But this map factors through the degree four
Belyi function X(4) → X(2) from the previous example whose critical points are of multi-
plicity two (Note that all of these coverings are regular). Hence, it only suﬃces to analyze
the ramiﬁed 8-fold cover ˜f : X(8) → X(4) ∼= CP1 whose critical points are of multiplicity

two and its critical values are the critical points of
conclude that the critical values of ˜f are ±1,±i, 0,∞ and the ﬁber above each of them con-
(cid:35)
sists of four critical points of multiplicity two. The group of deck transformations of ˜f is the
elementary abelian 2-group ¯Γ(4)/¯Γ(8) ∼= ker (PSL2(Z8) → PSL2(Z4)) ∼= Z2×Z2×Z2. The
cosets of matrices T 4 =
−4 5
in ¯Γ(4)/¯Γ(8) form a basis for this group over Z2. Now the order two deck transformation
of ˜f induced by the left action of an element γ ∈ Γ(4) − Γ(8), in its action on a critical
ﬁber (which consists of four critical points) either ﬁxes all the points or permutes them
as a product of two disjoint transpositions. The former can happen only if γ is congruent
to a parabolic matrix modulo eight. This is the case for the elements of the cosets of
T 4, ST 4S−1, A while the action of any other γ on critical ﬁbers of ˜f is ﬁxed point free

and thus results in the factorization X(8) → (cid:104)γ(cid:105)\X(8) → X(4) of ˜f : X(8) → X(4)
where the ﬁrst map is an unramiﬁed 2-fold covering a genus three Riemann surface by
the genus ﬁve Riemann surface X(8). Next, let us consider the deck transformations
induced by T 4, ST 4S−1, A. They ﬁx some of the critical points of ˜f because they are
parabolic matrices. They are conjugate in SL2(Z) and therefore by analyzing just one of
them it can be easily veriﬁed that each of these three deck transformations ﬁxes all the
points in exactly two of critical ﬁbers and in any of other four critical ﬁbers permutes
four points of that ﬁber as a product of two disjoint transpositions. Using the Riemann-
Hurwitz formula, we deduce that for any γ in {T 4, ST 4S−1, A}.Γ(8), X(8) → (cid:104)γ(cid:105)\X(8)
is a degree two ramiﬁed covering of a genus one Riemann surface by X(8) with precisely
eight critical points all of multiplicity two. We will utilize these observation to investigate
˜f : X(8) = Γ(8)\H∗ → X(4) = Γ(4)\H∗ via factorizing it by introducing some suitable
intermediate subgroups between Γ(8) and Γ(4) as in the following diagram:

X(8) = Γ(8)\H∗

unramiﬁed

(cid:0)Γ(8).(cid:104)AST 4S−1(cid:105)(cid:1)\H∗

/ (Γ(8).(cid:104)A(cid:105))\H∗

/(cid:0)Γ(8).(cid:104)A, ST 4S−1(cid:105)(cid:1)\H∗

/ X(4) = Γ(4)\H∗ ∼= CP1

(11)
In this diagram, all of the arrows are of degree two and the multiplicity of any of their
critical points is two since ˜f : X(8) → X(4) satisﬁes the same property. Only the left
column is unramiﬁed as indicated in the diagram. Hence since (Γ(8).(cid:104)A(cid:105))\H∗ is of genus

one as discussed before, we conclude that (cid:0)Γ(8).(cid:104)A, ST 4S−1(cid:105)(cid:1)\H∗ is of genus zero and
(Γ(8).(cid:104)A(cid:105))\H∗ and the genus three Riemann surface (cid:0)Γ(8).(cid:104)AST 4S−1(cid:105)(cid:1)\H∗ as hyper-
elliptic curves. The 2-fold ramiﬁed cover (cid:0)Γ(8).(cid:104)A, ST 4S−1(cid:105)(cid:1)\H∗ ∼= CP1 → X(4) =
(cid:0)(Γ(8).(cid:104)A, ST 4S−1, T 4(cid:105) = Γ(4)(cid:1)\H ∼= CP1 appeared in the right of (11) may be assumed

consequently the right column and the bottom row realize the genus one Riemann surface

to be z (cid:55)→ z2 because its critical values are exactly those critical values of ˜f where the
action of the parabolic element T 4 on the corresponding ﬁber is trivial and these are points
[∞] = ∞, [−1
2 ] = 0 of X(4) (cf. Figure 5). In this situation the critical values of the right
column and the bottom row are in the preimage of the set {±1,±i, 0,∞} under this map
but cannot be critical values of z (cid:55)→ z2. Finding these critical values enables us to write
the equations of these hyperelliptic curves explicitly and simplify the diagram (11) as:

˜f with the degree four Belyi function X(4) → X(2) ∼= CP1 derived in (10) shows that the

Example 6. The simple description in 2 of the monodromy representation allows one
to demonstrate examples of Belyi functions associated with non-congruence subgroups by
exhibiting their permutation representations. For instance, deﬁne a surjective homomor-
phism from the free group on two generators ¯Γ(2) onto A6 via sending T 2 , ST 2S−1 to
the generators (123), (23456) of the alternating group. The kernel, denoted with Γ, is a
normal subgroup of Γ(2) of index 360 which is not congruence since A6 is not a quotient
of Γ(2)/Γ(2N ) for any N , cf. [6]. Note that under Γ(2) → A6:

T 2 (cid:55)→ (123) ST 2S−1 (cid:55)→ (23456)

(T S)T 2(T S)−1 (cid:55)→ (23456)−1(123)−1 = (12)(6543)

Thus, following notations of [2], in the permutation representation (σ0, σ1, σ∞) of dessin,
σ0, σ1, σ∞ are the permutations of elements of A6 induced by right multiplication in
(23456), (12)(6543), (123) respectively. Plugging their orders k0 = 5, k1 = 4, k∞ = 3
and m = 360 in the Corollary 2 yields 40 for X(Γ)’s genus and implies that the dessin has
360 edges, 72 black vertices of degree 5, 90 white vertices of degree 4 and 120 faces each
with 6 edges. One can even extract some arithmetic information from this monodromy

data: the group of permutations on elements of ¯Γ(2)/¯Γ ∼= A6 generated by the right ac-
tion of a generating set of this quotient group obviously has the center equal to that of A6
which is trivial. Now the Corollary 3.2 from [1] implies that the ﬁeld of moduli for this
Belyi function is a ﬁeld of deﬁnition. More generally and by the same argument, this is
the case for any Belyi function X(Γ) → X(2) where the group N¯Γ(2)(¯Γ)/¯Γ is centerless.

4 Dessins on X0(N ) and Modular Equation

The primary objective of this section is to study the Belyi function f : X0(N ) = Γ0(N )\H∗ →
X(1) = Γ(1)\H∗ ∼= CP1, which according to Proposition 1 is actually
1
1728 j, and employ
it to compute the modular equation associated with Γ0(N ) which is the algebraic de-
pendence relation between Γ0(N )-invariant functions z (cid:55)→ j(z) and z (cid:55)→ j(N z).
It is
well-known that these two modular functions generate the function ﬁeld of X0(N ) and
the minimal polynomial of j(N z) over C (j(z)) is with integer coeﬃcients and of degree µ
written below. See [9] for further details.

The meromorphic function [z] (cid:55)→ j(z) on the compact Riemann surface X0(N ) may be
determined provided that Belyi function f : X0(N ) → X(1) ∼= CP1 has been computed.
Since the subgroup Γ0(N ) is not normal, this Belyi function is not regular and thus
computing it is much harder than what carried out in section 2 examples due to lack of
symmetry. But as (cid:104)T(cid:105)Γ(N ) ≤ Γ0(N ), once the regular Belyi function X(N ) → X(1) and
its very symmetric dessin are obtained along with an explicit description of the action of
the group Deck (X(N ) → X(1)) ∼= ¯Γ(1)/¯Γ(N ) generated by automorphisms of X(N ) =
Γ(N )\H∗ obtained from left actions of T =

this Belyi function and its dessin through the action of the subgroup ¯Γ0(N )/¯Γ(N ) of deck
transformations in order to derive the Belyi function X0(N ) → X(1) and its dessin. We
will illustrate this idea for N ∈ {2, 3, 6} where ¯Γ0(N ) and (cid:104)T(cid:105)¯Γ(N ) coincide. So to obtain
X0(N ) → X(1) it only suﬃces to consider X(N ) → X(1)’s quotient under the order N
automorphism induced by T .

Example 7. Suppose N = 2. In Example 1 the Belyi function X(2) ∼= CP1 → X(1) ∼=
CP1 was calculated as f (z) = (3z2+1)3
(9z2−1)2 (cf. (1)) whose dessin is depicted in Figure 1 and
its group of deck transformation is a version of S3 generated by involutions z (cid:55)→ −z and
z (cid:55)→ −z+1
(cid:17)2
3z+1 corresponding to S and T respectively. The latter is an order two M¨obius
3 . Therefore, any meromorphic function CP1 → CP1
transformation with ﬁxed points −1, 1

invariant under it factors via z (cid:55)→(cid:16) z+1

. Applying this map to coordinates of vertices

in Figure 1 are identiﬁed in Figure 6 under T ’s action on the upper half plane given by

According to Proposition 1, the dessin in Figure 6 conveys information about the congru-
ence subgroup Γ0(2): it possesses exactly one elliptic orbit, that of i+1
9 which is of order
2
two 10 . Looking at × vertices, there are two cusps [0], [∞] of degrees two and one11.

Example 8. Suppose N = 3. ¯Γ0(3) = (cid:104)T(cid:105)¯Γ(3) is an index N + 1 = 4 subgroup of
¯Γ(1) = PSL2(Z). So the degree twelve Belyi function

written in (5)

The ﬁrst map is the quotient map for the action of the group (cid:104)T(cid:105) on CP1. We saw in 2 that
T acts as the rotation through 120 ◦ about the origin. Hence, this quotient map can be

is
the unique elliptic orbit whose order is three whereas having a degree one black vertex, it
precisely has one elliptic orbit of order three12. Analyzing × vertices implies that orbits
of cusps for Γ0(3) are [∞] and [0] of widths one and three respectively.

Example 9. For N = 6, we have equalities µ6 = (cid:2)¯Γ(1) : ¯Γ(6)(cid:3) = 72,(cid:2)¯Γ(1) : ¯Γ0(6)(cid:3) =
6(cid:0)1 + 1

(cid:1) = 12 while T ’s coset in ¯Γ0(6)/¯Γ(6) is of order 6 = 72

12 . We deduce that
¯Γ0(6) coincides with (cid:104)T(cid:105)¯Γ(6) and therefore the degree twelve Belyi function X0(6) →
X(1) ∼= CP1 is just the quotient of map X(6) → X(1) ∼= CP1 appeared in (7) under the
automorphism induced by T ’s action which is an order six deck transformation. But X(6)
is the hexagonal elliptic curve y2 = x3 − 1 whose group of automorphisms is of order six

Note that as 2, 3 | N = 6, Γ0(N ) does not have any elliptic element and thus from
Proposition 1, its twelve edge dessin has four black vertices of degree three and six white
vertices of degree two. We infer that the underlying graph is the same as that of Example
2. Nevertheless, Belyi functions written in (5) and (12) are not isomorphic since the former
is regular and the latter is not, cf. Remark 1.

Example 10. Here we depict the dessin corresponding to the congruence subgroup
Γ0(11). This subgroup is of index 12, does not possess any elliptic element and has
exactly two cusps, i.e. orbits of 0,∞, of widths 11,1. Hence, some basic properties of its
dessin can be inferred: it is a dessin on the torus with 12 edges, 4 black vertices of degree
three, 6 white vertices of degree two and 2 faces surrounded by 22 and 2 edges. There-
fore, by deleting white vertices, we have an embedding of a graph with four degree three
vertices that has exactly one loop (which is the boundary of the face with two edges and
contributes two to the degree of the corresponding vertex.) on the torus as a map whose
complement consists of two 2-cells where of course one of them is the one determined by
the loop. The reader may quickly check that essentially there is only one way to draw
such a graph (as a map) on the torus and by putting back one white vertex on each edge,
we arrive at X0(11)’s dessin in Figure 8.

Figure 8

After studying the Belyi function f : [z] ∈ X0(N ) (cid:55)→ 1
1728 j(z) in these examples, let us
concentrate on z ∈ H (cid:55)→ j(N z) which is Γ0(N )-invariant and therefore gives a meromor-

21

phic function on X0(N ). Once more, this function has at most three critical values, i.e.
j(∞) = ∞ and the critical values j(ρ) = 0 and j(i) = 1728 of j : H → C. Thus, nor-
malizing it, one gets a new Belyi function on X0(N ) denoted by g. Calculating ﬁrst their
formulas and then the algebraic dependence relation between them results in the modular
equation for Γ0(N ). This is our key idea: thinking of the modular equation for Γ0(N ) as
an algebraic relation that two Belyi functions f : [z] (cid:55)→ 1
1728 j(N z)
on the modular curve X0(N ) should satisfy.

1728 j(z) and g : [z] (cid:55)→ 1

Remark 4. It is vital to note that in our approach to computing the modular equation
it is not suﬃcient to only obtain Belyi functions f and g up to isomorphism since we are
interested in the algebraic dependence relation between them. Thus, after computing a
version of the Belyi function f : X0(N ) → CP1 (corresponding to j(z)), the task that has
been carried out in Examples 7 , 8 and 9 for N ∈ {2, 3, 6}, its dessin is ﬁxed in the sense
of both algebraic (i.e. in terms of the orbits of Γ0(N )’s action appearing as vertices) and
geometric (in the sense of coordinates on the Riemann surface X0(N )) and then one should
consider how the dessin of the Belyi function g (corresponding to j(N z)) is positioned with
respect to it. For N = 2, 3 this is going to be achieved in Examples 11 , 12.

What can be said about g? Black (resp. white) vertices of its dessin correspond
to Γ0(N )-orbits of points z from upper half plane lying in the Γ0(N )-invariant subset
1
1
N Γ(1).ρ (resp.
N Γ(1).i) where again just as f ’s dessin described in Proposition 1, their
degree is either one or three (resp. two) with degree one happens precisely when z is
an elliptic point of Γ0(N ). Just like the case of f , vertices of type × (poles of the Belyi
function g) are orbits of cusps for Γ0(N ). The degree of g is same as that of f , i.e.

µ = [Γ(1) : Γ0(N )] =(cid:2)¯Γ(1) : ¯Γ0(N )(cid:3). These are immediate consequences of the following

commutative diagram:

H

Γ0(N )\H

[z](cid:55)→j(N z)
/ Γ(1)\H = X(1) − [∞] ∼= C

With some group-theoretic manipulations, one can acquire the orbits that are vertices of
g’s dessin on X0(N ): choose a complete set of left cosets representatives of Γ0(N ) in Γ(1)
denoted by γ1, . . . , γµ. It is easy to verify that:

As the ﬁnal remark that will aid us below in drawing f ’s and g’s dessins, consider points
[0], [∞] ∈ X0(N ) = Γ0(N )\H∗ which are vertices of type × in both cases. According to 1,
their degrees in f ’s dessin are given with N and 1 respectively. These degrees are reversed
for g’s dessin: writing q-expansion and carefully analyzing charts around these points of
X0(N ), it is not hard to see that the orders of poles [0] and [∞] of [z] ∈ X0(N ) (cid:55)→ j(N z)
are 1 and N respectively.

It only remains to derive the algebraic dependence relation between the cubic and the
quartic in y appeared above (this is a bit harder and is best to carry out with a software
supporting symbolic calculations, for example MAPLE.) and then substitute the cubic
(which came from f + g) with X + Y and the quartic (which came from f g) with XY .
This culminates in the modular equation for Γ0(3) below:
X 4 + Y 4 − X 3Y 3 + 2232(X 3Y 2 + X 2Y 3) + 2587918086X 2Y 2 − 1069956(X 3Y + XY 3)

The existence of a relation such as f

z−1 is an involution of Xi(2) ∼= CP1 (i ∈ {2, 3}) composition by
(cid:3) of
this property always exists and is the well-deﬁned holomorphic involution [z] (cid:55)→(cid:2) −1
(cid:1) = j(N z) which is the Belyi function g. Since under this involution f

= g(z) between two Belyi functions in either
of (15) or (17) that facilitated computing the algebraic dependence for either of these pairs
is not accidental. z (cid:55)→ z
which in either of pairs swaps the functions in that pair. An involution of X0(N ) with
X0(N ) = Γ0(N )\H∗. Composing it with the Belyi function f : [z] (cid:55)→ 1
[z] (cid:55)→ 1
goes to g, the symmetry of all algebraic equations that f, g satisfy and in particular the
modular equation will readily be inferred. We summarize our method:
Proposition 3. For any N ∈ N, there is a pair of Belyi functions consists of

We ﬁnish with another interesting consequence of what carried out in last two exam-
ples. Suppose in Proposition 3 after ﬁxing f ’s dessin (cf. Remark 4) Γ0(N )-orbits that
occur as vertices of g’s dessin has been determined after necessary group-theoretic argu-
ments and also the positions of these vertices on X0(N ) are known. Evaluating j = 1728f
at them might lead to some non-trivial j-invariant calculations because among g’s vertices
there are some new orbits not previously appeared. For example, compare Figures 6 and
9 where N = 2 and Figures 7 and 10 where N = 3. In the ﬁrst case, evaluating the Belyi
function f (z) = 1

Another interesting set of values of the modular j-function can be obtained by evaluating
1728f at ﬁxed points of the involution mentioned in Proposition 3. In both of Examples
11 and 12 this involution was given by z (cid:55)→ z
z−1 whose ﬁxed points are z = 0, 2. When
N = 2, under the action of Γ0(2) we have [z] = [−1
