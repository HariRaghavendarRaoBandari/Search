The gravitational baryogensis may not generate a suﬃcient baryon asymmetry in the standard
thermal history of the Universe when we take into account the gravitino problem. Hence it has been
suggested that anisotropy of the Universe can enhance the generation of the baryon asymmetry
through the increase of the time change of the Ricci scalar curvature. We study the gravitational
baryogenesis in the presence of anisotropy, which is produced at the end of an anisotropic inﬂation.
Although we conﬁrm that the generated baryon asymmetry is enhanced compared with the original
isotropic cosmological model, taking into account the constraint on the anisotropy by the recent
CMB observations, we ﬁnd that it is still diﬃcult to obtain the observed baryon asymmetry only
through the gravitational baryogenesis without suﬀering from the gravitino problem.

INTRODUCTION

The thermal history of the Universe after the Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis (BBN) is well studied, and some observa-
tions have conﬁrmed it as the standard cosmology. How-
ever, it suﬀers from various initial conditions such as the
horizon problem, ﬂatness problem, relic problem such as
monopoles and the origin of the large scale structure of
the Universe. Fortunately, these problems are elegantly
solved all at one time by the idea of inﬂation [1]. Never-
theless the standard Big Bang cosmology still have some
unsolved problems. One is the baryon-antibaryon asym-
metry appeared before the BBN epoch.
Its origin has
been remained as an outstanding mystery of the parti-
cle cosmology. In the inﬂationary scenario, as any pre-
existing baryon asymmetry would be rapidly diluted, the
baryon asymmetry must be generated after inﬂation.

The baryon asymmetry is typically characterized by
the ratio of the baryon number density nB to the en-
tropy density s.
Its value is observationally obtained
from the highly precise measurement of the cosmic mi-
crowave background radiation (CMB) by Planck mission
[2] as

YB ≡

nB
s

(1.1)

=(cid:0)0.864+0.016

−0.015(cid:1) × 10−10.

The other independent observations such as the abun-
dance of the primordial light elements from BBN also
support this value [3].
In order to generate a non-
vanishing YB, Sakharov [4] has argued the following three
necessary conditions: (i) the existence of baryon num-
ber (B) violating interactions; (ii) the breaking of C and

∗Electronic address: dark-matter@gravity.phys.waseda.ac.jp
†Electronic address: shuntaro.mizuno@aoni.waseda.jp
‡Electronic address: maeda@waseda.ac.jp

CP symmetries; and (iii) departure from thermal equilib-
rium. Many baryogenesis models which satisfy the above
criteria have so far been proposed [5–8].

Interestingly, however, there exists some loopholes to
generate the baryon asymmetry without satisfying the
Sakharov criteria. For example, in Ref. [9], the eﬀec-
tive CP T violating interaction is introduced. Since the
CP T violating interaction can bias B-violating interac-
tion among particles and antiparticles in the thermal
equilibrium, the Sakharov’s third criterion is not required
with this interaction. As the similar idea, the possibility
that a gravitational interaction plays an interesting role
in baryogenesis has been proposed in Ref. [10].
It was
shown that such an interaction dynamically breaks CP T
in an expanding Universe and generates the baryon num-
ber asymmetry while maintaining thermal equilibrium.

This gravitational baryogenesis is one of the attractive
models as its interaction may be obtained in supergravity
theories. However, in order to generate observationally
suﬃcient baryon asymmetry (1.1), the Universe needs
to experience a high-enough temperature state during a
generating baryon asymmetry phase if the Universe fol-
lows the standard thermal history. Unfortunately this
condition conﬂicts with the requirement from the grav-
itino problem not to overproduce the lightest supersym-
metric particles (LSPs) [11]. Hence, in the paradigm of
supergravity, the gravitational baryogenesis seems not to
work well.

In a less symmetric background spacetime, however,
some possibility of the enhancement of the baryon asym-
metry was argued in Ref.
[12]. They changed the
background from the Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-
Walker (FLRW) isotropic universe to the Bianchi type I
anisotropic spacetime and showed that the baryon asym-
metry will increase with the anisotropy of the Universe.
However, they have not discussed the detail, i.e., how
large this anisotropic enhancement eﬀect is and whether

or not it can really solve the aforementioned problem. In
addition, they have not mentioned about the origin of
anisotropy at all, either.

Hence, in this paper, we consider the Universe which
has an anisotropic characteristic at the early stage of its
history and assume that this anisotropy originates from
an anisotropic inﬂationary model [13]. Although most in-
ﬂationary scenarios assume an isotropic spacetime, there
is a possibility that an inﬂation may be inﬂuenced by the
existing gauge ﬁeld which coupled to the inﬂaton ﬁeld
[14]. Although, in the ﬁrst place, these models are moti-
vated by generating primordial magnetic ﬁeld, they also
generate a statistical anisotropy of the curvature pertur-
bations [15]. Of course, as long as we accept the cos-
mic no-hair conjecture [16–18], the accelerated expansion
during inﬂation makes the Universe isotropic. However,
we can evade this conjecture by introduction of nonmin-
imal kinetic term of a vector ﬁeld inspired from the su-
pergravity theory. An anisotropic hair can survive during
and after the inﬂation. We ﬁnd that the anisotropy of the
Universe rapidly grows at the end of the inﬂation, which
may aﬀect the gravitational baryogenesis. We evaluate
how large anisotropy is generated after the anisotropic
inﬂation and ﬁnd how large enhancement of the gravi-
tational baryon asymmetry is achieved. Then we con-
clude whether or not the gravitational baryogenesis can
explain the observed baryon asymmetry in the context of
the anisotropic inﬂation.

The rest of this paper is organizes as follows. In Sec. II,
we will overview the gravitational baryogenesis model in
the standard Big Bang cosmology and explain how it is
constrained by the gravitino problem.
In Sec. III, we
study the gravitational baryogenesis in the anisotropic
inﬂationary scenario and evaluate how the amount of
baryon asymmetry is enhanced by the anisotropy of the
Universe. The last section is devoted to discussion and
conclusions.
In Appendix, we shortly summarize the
anisotropic inﬂation.

II. GRAVITATIONAL BARYOGENSIS

A. Gravitational Baryogenesis

In order to discuss gravitational baryogenesis, we con-

sider the following interaction:

Sint =

1
M 2

∗ Z d4x√−g (∂µR) J µ,

(2.1)

where R is the Ricci scalar curvature and J µ is the
baryon number current (J µ could be the B − L charge
current, where B and L stand for baryon and lepton
number, respectively, and B − L can be translated to
B via electroweak sphaleron process [19].). M∗ is a
cut-oﬀ mass parameter in an eﬀective theory. If M∗ is
of the order of magnitude of the reduced Planck mass

2

MP ≡ (8πG)−1/2 ≃ 2.4×1018 GeV, the above interaction
could be obtained in a low-energy eﬀective ﬁeld theory
of quantum gravity. It is also worth mentioning that this
interaction can be obtained from a higher dimensional
operator in the K¨ahler potential in supergravity theories
[10].

Since the interaction in Eq. (2.1) violates CP , if there
exists a B-violating process in thermal equilibrium, it can
generate a net baryon number. The generated net baryon
number can be evaluated as follows: In the expanding
homogeneous Universe, we have

(∂µR) J µ =

1
M 2
∗

˙R
M 2
∗

(nb − n¯b) ,

(2.2)

where nb and n¯b are the baryon and anti-baryon number
densities, respectively.
In what follows, we will use an
overdot sign to denote the derivative with respect to the
cosmic time. This interaction shifts the energy of a bary-
onic particle by the amount of 2 ˙R/M 2
∗ relative to that
of an anti-baryonic particle, which provides an eﬀective
“chemical” potential given by µb = ˙R/M 2
∗

For relativistic fermionic type of baryons, using this ef-
fect, in thermal equilibrium, the non-zero baryon number
density given by

= −µ¯b.

nB = nb − n¯b = −

+(cid:16) µb

T (cid:17)3(cid:21) ,

(2.3)

will be generated [20]. Here, gb ∼ O(1) is the baryon
number of fermionic baryons.
In the expanding Universe, when the temperature
drops and B-violating interactions become ineﬀective, a
non-zero value of nB will be frozen. Therefore, the net
baryon asymmetry remains below the decoupling temper-
ature TD, where we denote the epoch when B-violating
interactions is frozen out by the subscript D.

While the entropy density of the Universe is given by
s = 2π2g∗(T )T 3/45 where g∗(T ) denotes the total degree
of freedom for particles that contribute to the entropy
of the Universe. Consequently, the baryon asymmetry
parameter is given by

YB ≡

(2.4)

˙R(T )
M 2

T(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)TD

where we have assumed TD ≫ |µb|. Even if there exists
bosonic type of baryons, the above result does not change
so much.

For the spatially ﬂat FLRW Universe, whose metric is

given by

ds2 = −dt2 + a2(t)(cid:0)dx2 + dy2 + dz2(cid:1) ,

the Einstein equations become

(2.5)

H 2 =

P

ρ ,

˙H = −

2M 2
P

(P + ρ) ,

(2.6)

where H is the expansion Hubble parameter deﬁned by
˙a/a, P and ρ are the pressure and energy density of
matter ﬂuid, respectively. The eﬀective equation-of-state
(EOS) parameter w = P/ρ is not necessary to be con-
stant.

In order to ﬁx the decoupling temperature TD, we have
to specify the B-violating interaction. In this paper, we
assume one B-violating interaction, which is is given by
an operator OB of mass dimension 4 + n. Such a B-
violating interaction may exist as a non-renormalizable
interaction in some eﬀective ﬁeld theory when we regard
the baryon conservation as an eventual symmetry of the
Standard Model of particle physics. n > 0 is required for
the B-violating interaction.

Since the coupling constant is proportional to 1/M n

B in
this interaction, where MB is the mass scale associated
with OB, the generation rate of such an interaction in
thermal equilibrium with the temperature T is given by
[10]

ΓB =

T 2n+1
M 2n
B

.

(2.7)

The B-violating interaction is decoupled when the Hub-
ble parameter becomes larger than ΓB. Therefore, TD
is ﬁxed by the condition H = ΓB. TD is described by
some function of MB and n, which are most fundamen-
tal parameters in the B-violating interaction model. It
is worth mentioning that a decoupling of B-violating di-
mension 5 interaction does not occur during reheating
phase. This is because the B-violating interaction rate
ΓB with the mass dimension smaller than 6 decreases al-
ways slower than the Hubble parameter H, and then H
cannot exceed ΓB.

When we discuss the gravitational baryogenesis, we
have to evaluate the Ricci scalar curvature R, which is
given by

R = 3H 2(1 − 3w).

(2.8)

Using the Einstein equations (2.6), the time derivative of
the Ricci scaler curvature is written by

˙R = −

√3(1 + w)(1 − 3w)

ρ3/2
M 3

P − 3 ˙w

M 2
P

.

(2.9)

In order to evaluate the generated net baryon asym-
metry, we need to specify the epoch of B-violation de-
coupling and calculate the value of ρ and T at that
time. In what follows, we will consider just the following
two cases: the reheating phase (w ≈ 0) and radiation-
dominated phase (w ≈ 1/3) 1.

1. Reheating Phase

3

If the reheating process after inﬂation is due to the
decay of an inﬂaton scalar ﬁeld φ to relativistic parti-
cles (radiation) and it is characterized by the oscillation
of φ, the reheating period can be described by matter-
dominated era (w ≈ 0). In this phase, the inﬂaton and
radiation energy density evolve as

˙ρφ + 3Hρφ = −Γφρφ,
˙ρr + 4Hρr = Γφρφ,

(2.10)

(2.11)

where Γφ is the decay rate of inﬂaton into radiation.

If M 4

I is the vacuum energy of the inﬂaton ﬁeld at the
end of inﬂation, the energy density of inﬂaton ﬁeld is
given by

(2.12)

ρφ = M 4

e−Γφ(t−tosc) ,

aosc(cid:19)−3
I (cid:18) a
where tosc ≃ MP /M 2
I . During this phase, we have
ρφ ∝ a−3 and a ∝ t2/3. Using the second law of thermo-
dynamics and supposing that all of the energy released
from inﬂaton decay is rapidly converted into radiation,
we can also evaluate the entropy and radiation energy
density in this phase:

S4/3 =

ρr = ΓφM 4

where we have ignored the initial entropy. Since a ∝ t2/3
in this epoch, we ﬁnd that ρr ∝ a−3/2 and S ∝ a15/8 if
the reheating process is slow (Γφ ≪ H(tosc)). Then

ρφ =

ρr =

(2.14)

where the variables with the subscript RD denote those
evaluated when radiation becomes dominant. TRD corre-
sponds to the reheating temperature. Finally, we rewrite
the energy density of inﬂaton ﬁeld:

ρφ =

π2g∗
30

T 8
T 4

RD

.

(2.15)

The total energy density ρ is approximated by ρφ, since
the main component of the matter ﬁeld in this phase is
the inﬂaton ﬁeld.

1 It is worth mentioning that it was reported in Ref. [10] that
the gravitational baryogenesis works in a very eﬃcient way and

easy to explain the observed baryon asymmetry when the baryon
generation occurs in the phase dominated by a nonthermal com-
ponent with w > 1/3. This case also includes the other scenarios
such as [21–23]

Using the above result together with Eq. (2.4) and

Eq. (2.9), we evaluate the baryon asymmetry as

YB ≃

πgbg1/2

T 11
D
∗ M 3
P T 6

RD

M 2

.

(2.16)

This asymmetry, however, is diluted by a continuous pro-
duction of entropy during the reheating epoch. From the
above, the entropy is generated as S ∝ a15/8 which means
that the entropy density evolves as s = S/a3 ∝ a−9/8.
During reheating phase, the baryon asymmetry dilutes
as YB ∝ a−15/8. In terms of the temperature, this dilu-
tion factor is given by (TRD/TD)5, which yields

YB ≃

πgbg1/2

M 3

.

M 2
∗

(2.17)

It is worth mentioning that the overall factor in this for-
mula is of order unity since g∗ ∼ O(102) in this time.
In this phase, by deﬁnition, the decoupling tempera-
ture must be in the range of TRD < TD < MI . Mean-
while, since the observed baryon asymmetry is about
10−10 and it is natural to assume that the baryon asym-
metry before dilution is less than order unity, we ﬁnd
the upper bound of the decoupling temperature as TD .
102TRD.
In consequence, the possible range of the de-
coupling temperature is

TRD < TD . 102TRD.

(2.18)

On the other hand, TD needs to be expressed by us-
ing MB that is a typical mass scale of the B-violating
interaction. From Eq. (2.6) and Eq. (2.15), the Hubble
parameter at the decoupling time is evaluated by

upper bounds correspond to TD = TRD and TD = 102TRD,
respectively. In supersymmetric theories, however, we have an
additional constraint on the reheating temperature by grav-
itino problem (TRD < 109 GeV), whose acceptable parameter
range is shown by the blue region. The intersection of the red

some non-trivial eﬀects. The radiation-dominated epoch
is characterized by w = 1/3 and then R = 0. As a re-
sult, no net baryon asymmetry seems to be generated.
However, we ﬁnd a loophole for this issue by taking into
account the quantum anomaly eﬀect [24] 2. The typical
gauge ﬁelds and matter contents at very high energy scale
have a trace anomaly, whose equation of state (EOS) is
given by (1 − 3w ∼ 10−2-10−1). This trace anomaly
makes T µ
µ 6= 0 and can generate a net baryon asymme-
try. In what follows, we discuss this case.
Using the above anomaly eﬀect, we can evaluate the

amount of the generating baryon asymmetry as

gravity, a net baryon asymmetry may be generated even during

B. Additional Constraint in Supergravity Theories

So far, we have discussed the condition for which
the observationally acceptable baryon asymmetry can be
generated. However, since some B-violating interactions
may be expected in supergravity theories, we will have
an additional constraint in such a model.

In supergravity theories, it is well known that gravitino
production places severe bounds on TRD. This bound
comes from two constraints: (i) protecting the products
of BBN from decay which is caused by late gravitino
decays, and (ii) avoiding the overclosure of the Universe
by gravitinos. Since the exact value of TRD is related
with the gravitino mass m3/2 and decaying process of
gravitino which strongly depend on supergravity theories,
throughout this paper, we adopt the constraint that TRD
must be smaller than 109 GeV, obtained from typical
supergravity theories [11].

From this restriction, using Eqs. (2.20) or (2.26), the
allowed region of MB is limited from the above. Conse-
quently, this makes M∗ also small in order to explain the
observationally acceptable baryon asymmetry.

In Figs. 1 and 2, then we show how the allowed parame-
ter region will be further restricted by this additional con-
straint. From Fig. 1, the allowed region predicts a tiny
value of M∗, which is lower than LHC energy scale. Since
we have not so far found any B-violating interactions up
to such a scale, we conclude that the gravitational baryo-
genesis during the reheating phase is unfavorable. From
Fig. 2, the cut-oﬀ mass scale M∗ also have to be small
in order to fulﬁll the observational constraint. As a re-
sult, we may not expect the eﬃcient generation of baryon
asymmetry in the FLRW background. That is why we
have to look for some enhancement mechanisms of gen-
erating baryon asymmetry for the gravitational baryoge-
nesis in supergravity theories.

In next section, we shall consider some enhancement
mechanism, which is found in an anisotropic universe
[12], and analyze the detail assuming an anisotropic in-
ﬂationary model.

In the radiation dominated era, the range of M∗ and

in which the observed baryon asymmetry is ob-
tained, is shown in Fig. 2, in which we have assumed
a dimension-6 B-violation interaction (n = 2).

As mentioned above,

it seems diﬃcult to generate
the baryon asymmetry by the gravitational baryogen-
esis both in the reheating phase and in the radiation
dominated stage after inﬂation. However, the baryon
number asymmetry could be enhanced in a less sym-
metric background spacetime as pointed out in Ref. [12].
They assumed the Bianchi type I anisotropic background
spacetime but with an isotropic matter ﬂuid, and then

they found that the eﬀect of anisotropy enhances the
generated baryon asymmetry compared with that in the
FLRW background.

Here, we will brieﬂy summarize the mechanism in

Ref. [12] and extend their discussion.

6

We consider an isotropic matter ﬁeld and Bianchi type I spacetime with the metric

ds2 = −dt2 + e2α(t)he−4β+(t)dx2 + e2(β+(t)+√3β−(t))dy2 + e2(β+(t)−

√3β−(t))dz2i .

w = P/ρ is the EOS parameter of the isotropic mat-

The mean expansion rate H, which corresponds to the
Hubble expansion parameter in the FLRW spacetime, is
deﬁned by

H = ˙α .

(3.3)

It is worth mentioning that this anisotropic back-
ground brings two enhancement eﬀects through ˙R and
TD. The shear term increases ˙R and then it enhances
the generated baryon asymmetry because YB is propor-
tional to ˙R. In contrast, since the eﬀect through TD is
non-trivial, one may need a further explanation, which
is given as follows. TD is determined by the condition
H ∼ ΓB. Since H and ΓB are determined by the Fried-
mann equation of the anisotropic Universe,

H 2 = Σ2 +

3M 2
P

MP(cid:19)2
ρ ∼ Σ2 +(cid:18) T 2

,

(3.4)

and by Eq. (2.7), respectively, TD increases as the shear
gets large when n ≥ 1. We then ﬁnd that YB becomes
larger as larger TD from Eqs. (2.17) and (2.22). As a
result, we ﬁnd that the shear also enhances the generated
baryon asymmetry through the increase of TD.

Expecting the above two enhancements, we shall eval-
uate the baryon asymmetry in the anisotropic Universe.
If the shear term is dominated comparing with the other
p Σ2, we easily ﬁnd YB with such
terms such that ρ ≪ 3M 2
a large shear Σ.

Here, we focus on the case when the decoupling of the
B-violating interaction occurs during the radiation sub-
dominated era3. Assuming that the shear is dominated,

anomaly with 1 − 3w = 10−1. The pale pink, dark pink,

for an isotropic universe is shown by the red region. When
we take into account the gravitino problem (TRD < 109 GeV)
in supersymmetric theories, the allowed region is restricted in
the shaded region below the blue line.

This gives the favorable region of M∗ and MB for the
anisotropic universe, which is shown in Fig. 3. From this
ﬁgure, we ﬁnd that if the magnitude of the shear Σ is
larger than 109 GeV, the cut-oﬀ scale M∗ can be larger
than the LHC energy scale.
Although this discussion shows the possibility of grav-
itational baryogenesis in anisotropic universe, it has not
clariﬁed how large the anisotropy can be and whether
or not it really solves the aforementioned problem in
the FLRW spacetime.
It has not given the origin of
the anisotropy at all, either. With all these matters in
mind,
in this paper, we continue to examine whether
the anisotropy is really helpful to settle the problem
of the gravitational baryogenesis based on a concrete
anisotropic inﬂation model, by which we can discuss the
origin of anisotropy as well as its evolution systematically.

7

with V (φ) being a potential, the anisotropy survives even
during inﬂation and then it can become large at the
end of inﬂation. Since such a large anisotropy would be
important in the anisotropic gravitational baryogenesis
as well, we reanalyze the evolution of the shear in the
anisotropic inﬂation model in Appendix B.

We assume the model parameter c in (3.10) is smaller
than O(10) beyond which the maximum value of Σ/H
does not change signiﬁcantly. The natural value of c will
be discussed later.

We denote the energy densities and the pressures of ra-
diation ﬂuid, of the inﬂaton ﬁeld and of the vector ﬁeld
by ρr, Pr, ρφ, Pφ, and ρv, (P x
v ), which are explic-
itly given by (B8), respectively. Here we have assumed
that the vector ﬁeld has the vacuum expectation value
in the x-direction. From the symmetry between y- and
z-directions, we set β− = 0 and β+ = β.

Then we introduce the total energy density ρtot and

v , P y

In this paper, we adopt the anisotropic inﬂationary
model proposed in Ref. [13], which is shortly summarized
in Appendix B. The spatial anisotropy is produced during
inﬂation in this model. Although an anisotropy in the
universe will usually disappear during inﬂation, it has
been shown that if there exists some coupling with an
inﬂaton in the kinetic term of the U(1) gauge ﬁeld such
that

for the anisotropic inﬂation model.

Comparing (3.16) with the result in the FLRW Uni-

verse given by Eq. (2.9), we ﬁnd that the anisotropic
component is added to the ﬁrst term of the right hand
side in Eq. (3.16) . Moreover, the second term reﬂects the
eﬀect of the shear evolution by the anisotropic pressure
of the vector ﬁeld. The last term, as well as Eq. (2.9),
represents the time change of the dominant components.
In order to calculate ˙w, we have to solve the evolution
equation of the matter ﬁelds. This evolution depends on
the phase where the baryon asymmetry is generated and
as in the isotropic case, we consider the following two
phases: (i) reheating phase and (ii) radiation-dominated
phase. We calculate it for each cases and compare the
generated baryon asymmetry with that in FLRW Uni-
verse.

1. Reheating Phase

Here, we assume that the reheating process occurs only
through the perturbative decay of inﬂaton whose rate is
expressed by Γφ. We adopt Γφ/m = 10−15 throughout
this paper4.
It is worth pointing out that this choice
does not change signiﬁcantly the ﬁnal result on the ratio
of the generated baryon asymmetry as we will see later.
There is also an energy transfer between the vector ﬁeld
and the inﬂaton ﬁeld, which transition rate is given by
Γv We assume that the radiation is generated not from
the vector ﬁeld but only from the inﬂaton ﬁeld, just for
simplicity. Thus, the energy evolution equations among
above three matters are given by

˙ρv + (4H + 4Σ)ρv = Γvρv,
˙ρφ + 3Hρφ = −Γvρv − Γφρφ,
˙ρr + 4Hρr = Γφρφ .

(3.17)

(3.18)
(3.19)

Using the equation for inﬂaton ﬁeld, we ﬁnd that the
transition rate Γv is described by

Γv =

2c
M 2
P

φ ˙φρv .

(3.20)

Assuming that the EOS parameter for each component
is constant during this evolution, we obtain ˙wtot from
Eqs. (3.17)-(3.19) as

˙wtot = −

(3.24)

The diﬀerence between (3.23) and (3.24) is only the part
inside the square root, which is just given by the Hub-
ble parameter. Since the Hubble parameter becomes
large by the existence of the shear, we expect the gener-
ated baryon asymmetry is consequently enhanced in the
anisotropic model.

We start to calculate the baryon asymmetry from the
end of inﬂation t = te for the anisotropic inﬂation model
with the potential V (φ) = 1
2 m2φ2. We then compare the
amount of the generated baryon asymmetry with that in
the FLRW Universe with the same set-up, i.e., we assume
that the value of MB is the same, which means that we ﬁx
the same B-violating interaction5, and that the inﬂaton
mass m and the deﬁnition of the end of inﬂation are the
same in both models. In Fig. 4, we plot the ratio of the
baryon asymmetry in the anisotropic model YB, aniso and
that in the standard isotropic model YB, iso

We must mention that we have used the following as-
sumptions in the above calculations. As we showed in
Sec. II, the additional entropy creation during the re-
heating phase dilutes the generated baryon asymmetry.
This dilution eﬀect can be treated easily in our calcu-
lation with the following assumption. Since we are fo-
cusing our attention on the case that the decoupling of
the B-violating interaction occurs during the reheating
phase, the reheating must be proceeded slowly. On the
other hand, the shear and the vector energy density is
diluted faster than the inﬂaton energy density, and so
the Universe immediately comes to resemble with FLRW
Universe. Hence we assume that the dilution factor is the
same as one of the FLRW Universe case, i.e., (TRD/TD)5.
Besides, we know that the gradual reheating makes the
reheating temperature depending only on the interaction
rate Γφ. This is because the reheating process will ﬁnish
at Γφ ≃ H and the temperature is given by the energy
density of the radiation which satisﬁes

H 2 = Σ2 +

ρtot ≃

(3.25)

4 From the standard perturbative reheating, the reheating temper-
ature is given by TRD ∼ pΓφMP . Thus, we have a constraint
Γφ/m ≤ 10−13 in order to obtain suﬃciently low reheating tem-
perature.

5 Here, we have assumed the B-violating interaction is given by a

mass dimension 6 (n = 2) operator.

9

baryon asymmetry is aﬀected by the anisotropic eﬀect
only in the case that the B-violating interaction is de-
coupled immediately after the end of inﬂation.
In the
other words, the ﬁne-tuning of model parameters is re-
quired in order for the anisotropic components to aﬀect
the generated baryon asymmetry.

In the above calculation, we have assumed that the re-
heating process starts at t = te. However, there is an am-
biguity when the reheating really starts. Hence, we have
also checked how the enhancement factor YB, aniso/YB, iso
is sensitive to the starting time of the reheating by choos-
ing the latest possible staring time t = tf which is when
the inﬂaton ﬁeld reaches φ = 0. We ﬁnd that the result
does not depend on the starting time of the reheating so
much (within the factor of 1±0.2).
Since we assume that the gradual reheating, as long
as Γφ is suﬃciently small, the anisotropic components
completely diluted before a certain amount of radiation
energy density appears in the total energy density. With
such a small value of Γφ, the enhanced baryon asymmetry
does not much change for the diﬀerent values of Γφ, as
the backreaction of radiation is neglected in the initial
phase of reheating. Therefore, the diﬀerent choice of Γφ
aﬀects only the temperature of the Universe. It means
that the ﬁne-tuning of MB depends strongly on the value
of Γφ.

Finally, we comment about the mass dimension of B-
violating interaction. The case of the mass dimension 6
(n = 2), which we have analyzed in this paper, may gives
the maximum enhancement. If the mass dimension is 5,
the decoupling of B-violating interaction never happens
because ΓB does not decrease faster than the Hubble
expansion rate H. For the case of the mass dimension
higher than 6 (n = 2), we expect that the increase of TD
by the shear becomes ineﬃcient, and it diminishes the
generated baryon asymmetry.

2. Radiation-dominated Phase

Next we evaluate ˙R in the radiation dominated phase.
In this phase, there is no longer the interaction between
the inﬂaton ﬁeld and the vector or the radiation ﬁeld.
Therefore, the evolution equations of the energy densities
are given by

˙ρv + (4H + 4Σ)ρv = 0,
˙ρr + (4 − 3ε)Hρr = 0 ,

(3.26)

(3.27)

where ε is the trace anomaly, which magnitude is ex-
pected to be 10−2-10−1. The eﬀective EOS parameter is
expressed by

wtot =

FIG. 4: The diﬀerence of the generated baryon asymmetry
between the anisotropic/isotropic models are plotted in terms
of MB. We assume that the B-violating interaction (n = 2)
is decoupled in the reheating phase. We choose the initial
data from the numerical calculation of anisotropic inﬂation
at t = te. and assume Γφ/m = 10−15. The black (diamond),
red (circle), green (box), and cyan (cross) plots represent the
results for the cases of c = 2, 3, 5, and 10, respectively.

where we have used the fact that the shear and the vec-
tor energy density are diluted faster than the inﬂaton
energy density. Thus the reheating temperature TRD are
assumed to be the same in both models, and so the diﬀer-
ence of the dilution factor depends only on the diﬀerence
of the decoupling temperature TD.

From Fig. 4, we ﬁnd the enhancement eﬀect of gener-
ating baryon asymmetry by the eﬀect of the anisotropic
component. Since, as mentioned in Appendix B, the gen-
erated anisotropy of the universe increases as the param-
eter c gets large, we ﬁnd that the amount of the baryon
asymmetry becomes larger for the larger value of c.

If we do not take into account the constraint from the
gravitino problem, YB, aniso can be larger by one order
of magnitude than YB, iso. However, if we impose such a
constraint, the enhancement factor is larger just by a few
times, which may not be suﬃcient. Since YB ∝ M−2
∗ , the
enhancement factor does not allow the observationally
favorable value of M∗ which must be suﬃciently higher
than the LHC scale. We conclude that it is diﬃcult to
obtain a suﬃcient baryon asymmetry in the reheating
phase.

In addition to this, as the shear decreases faster
than the other ﬁelds, its enhancement eﬀect disappears
rapidly. We ﬁnd from Fig. 4 that the eﬀect of anisotropic
components appear in the short range of MB, which value
is related to the decoupling temperature. Therefore, the

Thereby, from the evolution equations (3.26) and (3.27),

FIG. 5: The diﬀerence of generated baryon asymmetry be-
tween anisotropic/isotropic models, plotted as a function of
MB. In this picture, we assumed that the B-violating interac-
tion (n = 2) is decoupled in the radiation dominated phase.
Additionally, we choose the initial data from the numerical
calculation of anisotropic inﬂation at t = te. Also, we assume
trace anomaly is ε = 10−1. The black (diamond), red (circle),
green (box), and cyan (cross) plots represent the results for
the cases of c = 2, 3, 5, and 10, respectively.

If the reheating takes for long time, just as the previous
reheating case, the anisotropic component is completely
diluted and it will not aﬀect the generation of the baryon
asymmetry. Therefore, in this case, we assume that the
reheating process rapidly ﬁnishes. Assuming that the in-
stantaneous reheating occurs, the initial radiation energy
density is given by the inﬂaton energy density. We show
the generated baryon asymmetry in Fig. 5.

As the previous reheating case, we ﬁnd that the en-
hancement factor is at most O(1). We ﬁnd that the am-
biguity of when the reheating really starts does not aﬀect
the result signiﬁcantly (within the factor of 4).

10

We ﬁnd that the enhancement factor YB, aniso/YB, iso
is always smaller than that in the reheating case. We
also ﬁnd that the ratio is less sensitive to MB compared
with one in the reheating case. Thus, the anisotropic
component contribution is less eﬃcient in the radiation
dominated phase, but the tuning for MB is not required
strongly.

Furthermore, when we take into account the gravitino
problem, the expected reheating temperature and the ex-
istence of the anisotropic components in the radiation-
dominated phase may not be compatible. Since the en-
ergy scale of the inﬂation seems much higher than the
reheating temperature constrained by the gravitino prob-
lem, the assumption of an instantaneous reheating pro-
cess is contrary to this low reheating temperature. There-
fore, we conclude that it is diﬃcult to consider a suﬃ-
ciently large initial anisotropy in the radiation dominated
phase. As a result, the anisotropic components generated
in the anisotropic inﬂation do not improve the gravita-
tional baryogenesis enough.

C. Observational Constraint on c

In the above calculation, we have assumed the model
parameter c as a free parameter. However, c is strongly
constrained by the observation of CMB anisotropy.

The statistical anisotropy in the power spectrum of the

curvature perturbation is parametrized by [26]

P (k) = P (k)h1 + h∗(ˆk · ˆv)i ,

(3.32)

where ˆv is some preferred direction in space and h∗ is
the amplitude of the anisotropy. As shown by [27], h∗ is
calculated for the anisotropic power law inﬂation as

h∗ = 24(cid:18)1 −

1

c(cid:19) N 2

k ,

(3.33)

where Nk is the number of e-folds of the ﬂuctuation with
the wave number k counted from the end of the inﬂation.
The current observational bound on h∗ is given by 0.002±
0.016 (68% CL) [28]. The model parameter c is strongly
bounded as

1
c

1 −

. 10−7 ×(cid:18) |h∗|

10−2(cid:19)(cid:18) Nk

60(cid:19)−2

.

(3.34)

Thus we ﬁnd that c must be extremely close to unity,
so that the anisotropic component does not grow up
so largely.
It is diﬃcult to expect a suﬃciently large
anisotropy of the Universe from the anisotropic inﬂation
with satisfying the observational constraints.

Note that the above calculation is based on the as-
sumption that the model parameter c satisﬁes c−1& O(1)
so that the attractor solution of the anisotropic inﬂation
exists. Using another branch of the anisotropic inﬂation
found in Ref. [29], it was shown that the allowed param-
eter region is slightly increased.

11

constraint, however, might be relaxed in some supergrav-
ity models. In the case of the heavy gravitino mass, it
will decay before the BBN epoch but the overproduced
LSPs overclose the Universe. However, if the R-parity is
violated and LSPs can decay before the BBN epoch, we
can avoid the overproduction of LSPs. Then the high re-
heating temperature can be arrowed with such a R-parity
violating interaction.

IV. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

We have discussed the gravitational baryogenesis
mechanism in the anisotropic spacetime induced by the
anisotropic inﬂation. The main purpose of the present
work has been to check a possibility of the gravitational
baryogenesis by the anisotropic-shear enhancement. We
have obtained the following results using the concrete
anisotropic inﬂationary model.

First, we have clariﬁed the issue of gravitational baryo-
genesis that is unavoidable if the temperature of the uni-
verse is bounded by the gravitino problem. The cut-oﬀ
mass parameter M∗ is smaller than the LHC scale in or-
der to generate a suﬃcient baryon asymmetry. This un-
naturalness denies a possibility of baryogenesis via gravi-
tational interactions. However it might be resolved if the
background spacetime is anisotropic. This is due to the
shear which enhances ˙R and TD, and so the amount of
generating baryon asymmetry increases. For instance, if
there exists a huge shear such as Σ & 109 GeV in the
radiation dominated phase, the favorable M∗ is enlarged
above the LHC scale. Thus we ﬁnd that there is a little
possibility of gravitational baryogenesis.

Next, we have studied a concrete example of the
anisotropic spacetime caused by the anisotropic inﬂation.
Although the shear is negligible during the inﬂation, it
can grow exponentially at the end of the inﬂation. More-
over, we have seen that the anisotropy of the universe
Σ/H can increase to O(1) at the end of the inﬂation if the
model parameter c takes suﬃciently large value. We ﬁnd
that the anisotropy works to increase the baryon asym-
metry, but the enhancement factor is not large. Further-
more, as the anisotropic components are rapidly diluted
comparing with the other isotropic mater ﬁelds after the
inﬂationary phase is ﬁnished, the enhancement works
only in a brief period.
In other words, the anisotropic
eﬀect appears if and only if B-violating interaction de-
couple is occurred immediately after the end of inﬂation.
Thus, we newly suﬀer from the ﬁne-tuning problem for
MB. The most crucial problem is that c must be ex-
tremely close to unity from the observational constraint
by the statistical anisotropy in the power spectrum of the
curvature perturbation. Due to this, it is hopeless to gen-
erate large anisotropy of the universe by the anisotropic
inﬂationary model. The model of gravitational baryogen-
esis has been still suﬀered from a low temperature bound
by the gravitino problem.

It should be noted that in this paper we have as-
sumed the anisotropy of the universe is originated by the
anisotropic inﬂationary model.
If there exists another
mechanism for generating huge anisotropy, gravitational
baryogenesis might be reactivated again.

Finally, we comment on the reheating temperature. In
this paper, we have used the standard constraint for the
reheating temperature by the gravitino problem. This

(A1)

where Σ and ρ are the shear and energy density of the
matter ﬁelds, respectively. Here, we assume that the case
that the shear is dominated comparing with the other
P Σ2 ≫ ρ. On the other hand, we know
matter ﬁelds; M 2
that the shear evolves as Σ ∝ a−3, where a is the spatially
averaged scale factor. Therefore, from the Friedmann
equation, the Universe is expanded as a ∝ t1/3 in the
shear dominated epoch.
With this in mind, we discuss the evolution of the ra-
diation energy density in the reheating phase. The ra-
diation energy density is given by Eq.
If the
reheating processes gradually proceed (Γφtosc ≪ 1), Eq.
(2.14) can be solved as

where we have used a ∝ t1/3 in the shear dominated case.
Thus, the leading term of the radiation energy density is
constant in this phase.

This result means that the amount of the radiation
energy density generated by the inﬂaton ﬁeld is almost
balanced with its dilution eﬀect by the cosmic expansion.
That is why the temperature can be regard constant dur-
ing the shear dominated reheating phase. By contrast,
the gravitational baryogenesis needs a decoupling of the
B-violating interaction. We, however, cannot expect it,
if the background temperature is constant. That is be-
cause the constant temperature makes ΓB be also con-
stant with time, on the other hand H ∼ Σ monotonically
decreases in this phase. Accordingly, we conclude that
the gravitational baryogenesis does not occur during the
shear dominated reheating epoch.

Appendix B: Anisotropic Inﬂation

In this Appendix, we

shortly summarize

Adopting the inﬂaton potential

FIG. 6: Phase diagram of the evolution of the inﬂaton ﬁeld in
the anisotropic inﬂation model. The curve shows the evolu-
tion path in the φ- ˙φ phase space for the case with c = 2.
The transition between the ﬁrst isotropic and the second
anisotropic inﬂations occur around φ/MP = 11. After the

oscillating phase after the end of inﬂation.

than that of the inﬂaton, the ﬁrst phase is realized. Dur-
ing this phase, since the energy density of the vector ﬁeld
grows as ρv ∝ e4(c−1)α, the vector ﬁeld eventually comes
to aﬀect the dynamics of the inﬂaton ﬁeld and the sec-
ond anisotropic inﬂationary phase appears6. We show
one example in Fig. 6.

During the inﬂationary phase, we ﬁnd that the eﬀect
of shear cannot become as large as the Hubble parame-
ter. The measure of the anisotropy is described by Σ/H,
where H ≡ ˙α and Σ ≡ | ˙β| describe the average expansion
rate and the magnitude of the spacetime shear, respec-
tively. During the anisotropic inﬂation when the slow-
roll approximation is valid, it is shown that the above
anisotropic parameter satisﬁes [13]

This inﬂationary model possesses the following two
phases: (i) the conventional slow-roll inﬂationary phase
and (ii) the anisotropic inﬂation after the contribution
of the vector ﬁeld becomes no longer negligible. If the
initial energy density of the vector ﬁeld is much smaller

ǫH ≡ −

(B24)

Eq. (B23) means that Σ/H is approximately the same as
the slow-roll parameter ǫH , unless |c− 1| ≪ 1. Therefore,

6 However, if there exist three or more U(1) ﬁelds with the same
coupling function or the Yang-Mills ﬁeld with the similar cou-
pling to the inﬂaton ﬁeld, an isotropic inﬂationary expansion
becomes an attractor[30, 31].

stage.

FIG. 7: The evolution of the anisotropy parameter Σ/H
with respect to the e-foldings.
In the ﬁrst isotropic inﬂa-
tionary phase, the anisotropy grows rapidly up to O(ǫH)
in accordance with the increment of the vector energy den-
sity. While it becomes almost constant during the second
anisotropic inﬂationary phase. Then it suddenly grows again
just at the end of the inﬂation. The black (solid), red (dot-
ted), green (dashed), and blue (chain) plots show the cases
of c = 2, 3, 5, 10, respectively. We also enlarge the ﬁgure near
the peaks to see the dependence of c more clearly.

However, as shown in Fig. 7, the shear increases expo-

nentially at the end of inﬂation.

In the evaluation of the generated baryon asymmetry
in the text, we have used our numerical solution, but
the increase of the shear at the end of inﬂation can be
obtained (or restricted) by the semi-analytic approach,
which we will show in the next section.

Appendix C: Evaluation of the shear in anisotropic

inﬂation

In this Appendix, we derive an upper limit of the space-
time shear at the end of the anisotropic inﬂation by the
semi-analytic approach (See also [32]).

First we see the existence of the saturation of the
shear magnitude from our numerical calculation. Using
Eqs. (B16) and (B17), we describe the shear in terms of
the slow-roll parameter ǫH as

FIG. 8: Plots of the shear Σ2 vs slow-roll parameter ǫH with
c = 2. The vertical broken line expresses ǫH = 1 . The upper
bound of the shear is evaluated at the intersection point.

We then evaluate the more precise upper bound of
anisotropy by the semi-analytic approach. For a chaotic
inﬂation with V (φ) = 1
2 m2φ2, H and φ can be approxi-
mated by linear functions of the cosmic time during the
second inﬂationary phase:

Σ2 =

(2ǫH − 3 − 3wtot)ρtot

6M 2

P (3 − ǫH)

.

(C1)

Since the right hand side of Eq. (C1) includes ρtot, its
dependence on ǫH seems complicated. During the inﬂa-
tionary era satisfying ǫH ≤ 1, however, we ﬁnd that Σ
increases monotonically as ǫH increases from the numeri-
cal calculation as shown in Fig. 8. The upper limit of the

is the end time of inﬂation evaluated by ǫH = 1. Al-
though the exponential function in Eq. (C8) does not
change so much during the above inﬂationary period, the
amplitude A(t) grows rapidly and saturates around the
end of inﬂation, just because of the typical behavior of
the error function. As a result, we ﬁnd that the shear
increases drastically during the anisotropic inﬂationary
phase.

We expect from the above saturation of Σ that the
anisotropy of the Universe becomes the largest at the
end of the inﬂation. The maximal value is obtained at
t = te as

Here, we have used cH(tt)2/m2 ≫ 1.
This result gives the better evaluation for the maximal
value of anisotropy comparing with the previous result
Eq. (B23). The other approach to evaluate the maximal
value by use of the higher-order expansion of the slow-roll
parameter has been also given [32]. Our result is mostly
the same as theirs.

Eq. (C11) gives a good explanation for the tendency
that the anisotropy of the Universe at the end of inﬂation
is larger as the parameter c increases as well as the fact
that it is saturated for suﬃciently large c. Therefore, we
do not expect an enormously large anisotropy at the end
of the anisotropic inﬂation even with the very large c.
