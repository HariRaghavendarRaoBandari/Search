RIGIDITY OF 2-STEP CARNOT GROUPS

MAURICIO GODOY MOLINA, BORIS KRUGLIKOV, IRINA MARKINA,

AND ALEXANDER VASIL’EV

Abstract. In the present paper we study the rigidity of 2-step Carnot groups,
or equivalently, of graded 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras. We prove the alterna-
tive that depending on bi-dimensions of the algebra, the Lie algebra structure
makes it either always of inﬁnite type or generically rigid, and we specify the
bi-dimensions for each of the choices. Explicit criteria for rigidity of pseudo H-
and J-type algebras are given. In particular, we establish the relation of the
so-called J 2-condition to rigidity, and we explore these conditions in relation
to pseudo H-type algebras.

1. Introduction

The study of H(eisenberg)-type algebras started in the 80’s with A. Kaplan’s
seminal paper [24]. These graded 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras are profoundly
related to representations of Cliﬀord algebras of vector spaces endowed with a
positive deﬁnite inner product, and have been extensively studied for the past 35
years, see for example [14, 16, 17, 25, 26, 31, 37].

The extension of the work of Kaplan to Cliﬀord algebras over non-degenerate
scalar product spaces is much more delicate and has only been treated in detail
recently [6, 10, 12, 19, 21, 22]. In this paper, we will refer to such an extension
as to pseudo H-type algebras.

Two important algebraic results concerning the classical H-type algebras with
a positive deﬁnite scalar product are a complete characterization of rigid H-type
algebras, that are those with a ﬁnite Tanaka prolongation, and those H-type
algebras satisfying a Cliﬀord algebraic requirement known as the J 2-condition,
see [14]. Both algebraic conditions have deep implications in other aspects of the
study of H-type groups. The rigidity of most H-type algebras is an obstruction
to the development of an analytic deformation theory, while the presence of the
J 2-condition has profound geometric consequences on their groups, for example,
they are transitive isometry subgroups of hyperbolic spaces, they appear as the
nilpotent part of Iwasawa decompositions of rank one groups G = KAN, and

moreover, the group AN is symmetric if and only if the Lie algebra of N satis-
ﬁes the J 2-condition [14]. Analogues of these milestones are not known in the
pseudo H-type context, and the aim of the present article is to contribute in these
directions.

The fact that the Lie algebras obtained by non-degenerate indeﬁnite bilinear
forms has not been duly addressed is surprising, especially since Cliﬀord alge-
bras deﬁned by non-degenerate scalar product have played a fundamental role
in mathematics and physics, see [29, 30, 32]. An intimately related object to
the pseudo H-type algebras that appears naturally in mathematical physics is
the notion of extended (super-)Poincar´e algebras, see [1, 2, 3, 4]. Some of our
results have analogues in this theory. An interesting fact that we plan to inves-
tigate in the future is the connection between the isometry algebra of a simply
connected homogeneous quaternionic K¨ahler manifold, studied in [13], and the
pseudo H-type algebra n3,4 presented at the end of Section 4.

The fundamental problem in the analysis of quasi-conformal mappings (even
of lower regularity) is to detect when a non-holonomic structure on a manifold
has at most a ﬁnite-dimensional family of automorphisms [33, 38, 37]. The model
situation is the rigidity of Carnot groups, that is determination whether the trans-
formation group of a Lie group with left-invariant bracket generating vector distri-
bution is a Lie group itself (Carnot groups are usually considered with a positive
deﬁnite or sometimes indeﬁnite metric, but for the rigidity issue this structure
is omitted, since the isometry group is always ﬁnite-dimensional). Equivalently,
linearization reduces the problem to ﬁnite-dimensionality of the Tanaka prolon-
gation of a graded nilpotent Lie algebra. This problem is non-trivial already for
2-step nilpotent algebras, which is the main subject of our paper. We will resolve
the problem for the generalizations of H-type structures discussed above, and
clarify the situation with the general 2-step nilpotent algebras n = n−2 ⊕ n−1
depending on their bi-dimensions (n−2, n−1).

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 is devoted to introducing the
main concepts and notations that will be in use throughout the paper. In order
to keep track of our hypotheses, we have introduced the concepts of M-type and
pseudo J-type algebras that generalize the well-known objects in the positive
deﬁnite context. Section 3 is dedicated to proving rigidity of a wider class of
real graded 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras with the center of dimension ≥ 3. This
result applies to the well-known case of pseudo H-type algebras. Section 4,
deals with the J 2-condition of pseudo J-type algebras and their relation to the
rigidity. The next two sections are devoted to the generic rigidity of graded 2-step
nilpotent Lie algebras and to describing the position of pseudo H-type algebras
among the rigid ones. We also study the pseudo H-type algebras that satisfy the
J 2-condition in Section 7. After careful analysis, we conclude that besides the
well-known classical Abelian, Heisenberg, quaternionic and octonionic H-type
algebras, there are only their pseudo-analogs with this property (these new cases
are described), thus exhausting all possible situations.

2. Pseudo J -type and pseudo H-type algebras

Let n = n−2 ⊕n−1 be a real or complex graded 2-step nilpotent Lie algebra, and
let h. , .i be a non-degenerate real or complex symmetric bilinear form. We assume
that the restriction h. , .in−2 of h. , .i to the subspace n−2 is also non-degenerate
and the decomposition n = n−2 ⊕ n−1 is orthogonal (such a choice can be made
on any 2-step algebra n). We call the pair (n, h. , .i) an M-type Lie algebra, since
such objects have been referred to as “metric Lie algebras” in the real case with
a positive deﬁnite symmetric bilinear form, see, for example [17]. A complex
Lie algebra may have diﬀerent real forms. Each real form carries a real non-
degenerate symmetric bilinear form, whose complexiﬁcation coincides with the
original complex non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form.

Deﬁnition 1. Let (n, h. , .i) be an M-type Lie algebra. The linear representation
J : n−2 → End(n−1) deﬁned by

(1)

hJzx, yin−1 = hz, [x, y]in−2

for all x, y ∈ n−1, z ∈ n−2.

is called the J-map of n.

Deﬁnition 2. A real M-type algebra (n, h. , .i) is of pseudo J-type if there is an
orthonormal basis {z1, . . . , zk} for n−2 such that the J-maps satisfy the condition

(2)

J 2
zi = ± Idn−1,

i = 1, . . . , k.

Note that this deﬁnition extends the notion of a J-type algebra in [37, Sec-
tion 6].
It is relevant to note that we consider the operators Jzi as complex
structures for some indices i = 1, . . . , k, but we also allow involutions for the
rest of them. Moreover, the identities (2) are not necessarily related to the Clif-
ford condition J 2
zi = −hzi, ziin−2Idn−1 deﬁned on the chosen basis for n−2, as it
has been used in [37] in the presence of a positive deﬁnite scalar product. A
particular case of these pseudo J-type algebras are the pseudo H-type algebras
introduced in [10, 22].

Deﬁnition 3. A real M-type algebra (n, h. , .i) is said to be of pseudo H-type if
the J-maps satisfy the Cliﬀord relations

(3)

JziJzj + Jzj Jzi = −2hzi, zjin−2Idn−1,

i, j = 1, . . . , k,

for a basis {z1, . . . , zk} of n−2 (that can be chosen orthonormal).

Note that equation (3) implies that the J-map can be extended to a represen-
tation of the Cliﬀord algebra Cl(n−2, h. , .in−2) on the space n−1. Condition (3)
implies condition (2) for a special choice of signs, but not conversely. Pseudo
J-type and pseudo H-type algebras originated from the papers [24, 33] in which
H-type algebras were deﬁned as generalizations of the Heisenberg algebra en-
dowed with a positive deﬁnite scalar product.

The construction of pseudo H-type Lie algebras is delicate, so we postpone
its precise description to Section 7. Nevertheless, let us describe them brieﬂy
here. We denote by Rr,s the vector space Rr+s whose symmetric bilinear form is

v = (v1, . . . , vr, vr+1, . . . , vr+s) ∈ Rr+s

by polarization. The pseudo H-type Lie algebra nr,s(V ) is a real graded 2-step
nilpotent Lie algebra structure on the space Rr,s ⊕ V , where V is an admissible
Cl(Rr,s)-module. If the Cliﬀord module V is irrelevant to the statement we will
denote by nr,s the class of all pseudo H-type algebras with the same center.
Equivalent deﬁnitions of pseudo H-type algebras can be found in [10, 22, 24].

The H-type algebras are a special case of a wider class of algebras satisfying
the hypothesis (H ), introduced in [33], which states that ωα(x, y) = α([x, y]) is
a non-degenerate 2-form on n−1 for any non-zero α ∈ n∗
−2. In [16, 17, 31, 35] the
authors established the following equivalent deﬁnitions.

Proposition 1. The following statements are equivalent for a real graded 2-step
nilpotent Lie algebra n = n−2 ⊕ n−1:

(1) n satisﬁes M´etivier’s hypothesis (H).
(2) adx : n−1 → n−2 is surjective for any non-zero x ∈ n−1.
(3) The map Jz is non-degenerate for any non-zero z ∈ n−2.

3. Rigidity of M -type algebras

Given a graded nilpotent Lie algebra n = Ls

i=1 n−i generated by n−1, there is
an algebraic procedure to compute symmetries of n−1, called the Tanaka prolon-
gation [43]. This is the maximal graded Lie algebra ˆn = n−s ⊕ · · · ⊕ n−1 ⊕ n0 ⊕ . . .
with ˆn<0 = n. There is a vast literature on this topic, and we refer the reader
to [5, 8, 34, 37, 45] and the references therein for an overview.

A graded 2-step nilpotent Lie algebra n = n−2 ⊕ n−1 is called rigid or of ﬁnite
type if its Tanaka prolongation ˆn = n−2 ⊕ n−1 ⊕ n0 ⊕ · · ·
is ﬁnite dimensional.
Otherwise it is called of inﬁnite type. These deﬁnitions are valid for either complex
or real Lie algebras. We will assume throughout the text that n is fundamental
or equivalently stratiﬁed, i.e. n−1 generates n, and in the 2-step case n−1 contains
no central elements, the center of n is exactly n−2, see [43].

A criterion to detect whether a given complex graded 2-step nilpotent Lie alge-
bra n = n−2 ⊕ n−1 is rigid is the corank one criterion (see [15, Theorem 1], based
on [43, Corollary 2 of Theorem 11.1], and [27]). It states that n is of inﬁnite type
if and only if there exist x ∈ n−1 and a hyperplane Π ⊂ n−1, such that

[x, y] = 0 for all

y ∈ Π.

A key observation is that the corank one criterion can be rewritten conveniently
in the case when the adjoint map of n induces endomorphisms of n−1 through
a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form, as in Deﬁnition 1. We conclude that
above is equivalent to the existence of a non-zero vector x ∈ n−1 with

Jn−2x ∈ Π⊥,

or

dimC Jn−2x = dim(Π⊥) = 1.

RIGIDITY OF 2-STEP CARNOT GROUPS

This means that Jn−2 is a one dimensional complex subspace of End(n−1), and
therefore, there exists

L ⊂ n−2,

codimC L = 1,

such that JLx = 0.

The last condition is equivalent to say that x ∈ Tz∈L ker(Jz). Thus, we conclude:

n is of inﬁnite type if and only if there exists a subspace

L ⊂ n−2,

codimC L = 1,

ker(Jz) 6= {0}.

such that \

z∈L

Notice that for real graded 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras n the criterion fails in
its suﬃcient part and the complexiﬁcation is required, i.e. condition (4) will be
applied to nC and J C.

Remark 1. Even though this rigidity criterion is formulated in terms of M-
type algebras, viz. the deﬁnition of the operators Jz involves a choice of a scalar
product on n, the output, i.e., the type of algebra n (ﬁnite or inﬁnite), does not
depend on this choice.

Since the Tanaka prolongation is a linear algebra operation, we notice the
following well-known statement concerning the relation between the complexiﬁ-
cation and prolongations or real Lie algebras.

Proposition 2. Let n be a real graded nilpotent Lie algebra of any step, and let

This statement has the following immediate consequences.

nC be its complexiﬁcation. Then ˆnC = cnC.
Corollary 1. Let n and ˜n be two graded nilpotent Lie algebras such that nC ∼= ˜nC.
Then they are either simultaneously rigid or of inﬁnite type.

Corollary 2. Let n be a real graded nilpotent Lie algebra of any step with the
complexiﬁcation nC. Then n and nC are either simultaneously rigid or of inﬁnite
type in their respective categories.

Proof. Recall that dimC nC = dimR n, where nC is the complexiﬁcation of the real
vector space n, and the claim follows.
(cid:3)

The idea of the following constructions is to employ the complexiﬁcation and
criterion (4) in order to detect the rigidity of real 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras.
The following is a special case of Theorem 4 in [15], see also [37, Lemma 6].

Lemma 1. Let n = n−1 ⊕ n−2 be a real M-type algebra. If dimR n−2 = 2, then n
is of inﬁnite type.

Proof. Let us complexify n and use Corollary 2. Choose a basis z1, z2 of nC
−2. For
some λ ∈ C the vector z = z1 + λz2 is null and so det Jz1+λz2 = 0. Then one can
take L = span{z} and the claim follows from ker(Jz) 6= 0.
(cid:3)

The aim of this section is to generalize [37, Theorem 1] to a much wider class
of real Lie algebras. In order to state the result, we introduce the following con-
dition (C): an M-type algebra n = n−2 ⊕ n−1 satisﬁes this condition if

6

M. GODOY MOLINA, B. KRUGLIKOV, I. MARKINA, A. VASIL’EV

(C)

There exist three linearly independent vectors z1, z2, z3 ∈ n−2 such
that the J-maps Jzi are non-degenerate, and JziJzj = σijJzj Jzi, for
all i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3}, where σij ∈ {−1, 1} and σ12σ13σ23 = −1.

Condition (C) is not too restrictive because several important systems satisfy
it. For example, it is veriﬁed in the important case of the pseudo H-type algebras
of Deﬁnition 3. Another case in which it holds is when Jzi commutes with both
Jzj and Jzk, but Jzj and Jzk anti-commute.

Theorem 1. Let n = n−2 ⊕ n−1 be a real M-type algebra with dimR n−2 ≥ 3 that
satisﬁes condition (C). Then n is rigid.

Proof. Let z1, z2, z3 ∈ n−2 be the linearly independent vectors from condition (C)
and with a slight abuse of notation deﬁne K = spanC{z1, z2, z3} ⊂ nC

−2.

Suppose, that nC is of inﬁnite type, and let L ⊂ nC

−2 be the codimension one
subspace coming from the corank one criterion. By dimension counting, it is easy
to see that dimC(K ∩ L) ≥ 2.

Without loss of generality, we can assume that there are s1, s2 ∈ C such that
K ∩ L ⊃ spanC{z1 + s1z3, z2 + s2z3}. By the deﬁnition of L, there is a non-zero
x ∈ nC

−1 such that

(Jz1 − s1Jz3)(x) = (Jz2 − s2Jz3)(x) = 0,

where we use the notation Jz for the complexiﬁcation as well. By the non-
degeneracy of Jzk, k ∈ {1, 2, 3}, it holds that s1, s2 6= 0. By condition (C), we
have that

Jz1Jz2x = s2Jz1Jz3x = σ13s2Jz3Jz1x = σ13s1s2J 2

z3x,

and analogously, Jz2Jz1x = σ23s1s2J 2
z3x. Thus, it follows that σ23 = σ12σ13. This
contradicts σ12σ13σ23 = −1 in condition (C), and so nC is rigid. The rigidity of n
follows from Corollary 2.
(cid:3)

Observe that Theorem 1 is valid in a wider variety of situations than just M-
type algebras. In particular, in the case of some real graded 2-step nilpotent Lie
algebras with symmetric bilinear forms degenerating on their centers n−2, as long
as there is a three dimensional subspace of n−2 that makes condition (C) hold.
They have been considered before in the literature, see [6, 9, 12].

As a consequence of Theorem 1 we have the following results, see also [39].

Corollary 3. Any pseudo H-type algebra with dim n−2 ≥ 3 is rigid.

Corollary 4. Let n be a pseudo J-type algebra, and let A be the subalgebra of
End(n−1) generated by the set {JzJw : z, w ∈ n−2}. If n is of inﬁnite type, then
A has a common eigenvector over C.

Proof. Choose an orthonormal basis {z1, . . . , zk} of n−2. As in the proof of
Theorem 1, by complexifying, we know there exist non-zero complex numbers
s1, . . . , sk−1 ∈ C such that

(5)

Jzi − siJzk ∈ JL,

RIGIDITY OF 2-STEP CARNOT GROUPS

where L is the subspace given in the corank one condition. If x ∈ nC
−1 is the non-
zero vector corresponding to L, then equation (5) implies that there are constants
cij ∈ C, i, j ∈ {1, . . . , k}, such that JziJzj x = cijx. Consequently, since any I ∈ A
can be written as a polynomial in the variables JziJzj , say I = P (. . . , JziJzj , . . . ),
we have Ix = P (. . . , JziJzj , . . . )x = P (. . . , cij, . . . )x. (cid:3)
Remark 2. It follows from Corollary 4 that, in particular, if there are three
linearly independent vectors z1, z2, z3 ∈ n−2 such that [Jz1, Jz2], [Jz1, Jz3], [Jz2, Jz3]
have no common eigenvector over C, then n is rigid.

4. Rigidity and J 2-condition

The main goal of this section is to characterize an analogue of the so-called
J 2-condition for pseudo J- and H-type algebras, studied in [11, 14]. Although
in the classical situation this condition has deep geometric implications, we only
focus here on those algebras that admit this algebraic property.

Deﬁnition 4. A pseudo J-type algebra n = n−2 ⊕ n−1 satisﬁes the J 2-condition if
for every x ∈ n−1, hx, xin−1 6= 0, and for every orthogonal pair z, z′ ∈ n−2, there
exists z′′ ∈ n−2 satisfying
(6)

JzJz ′x = Jz ′′x.

Equation (6) implies that the space Rx ⊕ Jn−2x = {αx + Jz ′x | α ∈ R, z′ ∈ n−2}
for any given x ∈ n−1, hx, xin−1 6= 0, is invariant under the action of Jz for every
z ∈ n−2. The converse statement is partially true. Namely, given a pseudo H-
type algebra n, if for any x ∈ n−1, hx, xin−1 6= 0, the space Rx ⊕ Jn−2x is invariant
under the action of Jz for every z ∈ n−2, then the pseudo H-type algebra n
satisﬁes the J 2-condition. The latter holds thanks to the identity

hJzx, Jz ′xin−1 = hz, z′in−2hx, xin−1

that will be used in the sequel. Nevertheless, the pseudo J-type algebras, which
are not of pseudo H-type do not possess this property. If hx, xin−1 6= 0, then the
space Rx ⊕ Jn−2x is also a non-degenerate subspace of (n−1, h. , .in−1) and the J 2-
condition applied to pseudo H-type algebras is equivalent to the existence of an
admissible Cliﬀord module of a special type. In the case when hx, xin−1 = 0, the
invariant subspace is a degenerate subspace of (n−1, h. , .in−1), but still possesses
some interesting algebraic properties, see Theorem 2. Therefore, we deﬁne the
so-called general J 2-condition, where we omit the requirement hx, xin−1 6= 0.
Deﬁnition 5. A pseudo J-type algebra n = n−2 ⊕ n−1 satisﬁes the general J 2-
condition if for any x ∈ n−1, and for all orthogonal pairs z, z′ ∈ n−2 there exists
z′′ ∈ n−2 such that equation (6) holds.

Observe that for J-type algebras (more generally, for the case when h. , .in−1 is a
positive deﬁnite metric on n−1) the general J 2 condition is equivalent to the usual
J 2 condition. Note also that the J 2-condition is fulﬁlled with z = z′ = z′′ = 0 for
dim(n−2) = 0 and with z′ = z′′ = 0 for dim(n−2) = 1.

Theorem 2. A pseudo J-type algebra n = n−2 ⊕ n−1, dim(n−2) ≥ 3, satisfying
the general J 2-condition is rigid.

8

Proof. We will work over the ﬁeld C. If necessary we use the complexiﬁcation
and ﬁnish the proof by applying Corollary 2.

By contradiction, let us suppose that a pseudo J-type algebra n is of inﬁnite
type. Corollary 4 implies that there exists a common eigenvector x ∈ n−1 for the
algebra A generated by the operators JziJzj , where {zi} is an orthonormal basis
for n−2. Thus, we obtain JziJzj x = µzi,zj x for some non-vanishing µzi,zj ∈ C.

We claim that the same x is also an eigenvector for all Jz, z ∈ n−2. Indeed,
since the pseudo J-type algebra satisﬁes Deﬁnition 5, for any pair zi, zj of vectors
from the orthonormal basis for n−2, there is z′′
x.
zi = ǫi = ±Idn−1. Since j is an arbitrary
We get Jzj x = ǫiJziJz ′′
index and {zj} is a basis for n−2, the claim follows.

ij ∈ n−2 such that JziJzj x = Jz ′′

x = ±µzi,z ′′

Let us ﬁx the eigenvector x. Then Jzx = λzx for a non-zero linear function

λ : n−2 → C. The deﬁnition of pseudo J-type algebras leads to

(7)

hz, [x, y]in−2 = hJzx, yin−1 = λzhx, yin−1 = −hx, Jzyin−1

for all y ∈ n−1, z ∈ n−2. This implies that hx, xin−1 = 0, and we have [x, Π] = 0
for the co-dimension 1 subspace Π ⊂ n−1 orthogonal to x. We can choose y 6∈ Π
such that hx, yin−1 = 1. Thus, there exists a basis e1 = y, e2 = x, e3, . . . , en,
n = dim n−1, ei ∈ Π for i > 1, such that he1, e2in−1 = 1, he2, eiin−1 = 0 for i > 1.
From (7) with x = e2 and y = e1 we obtain λz = −he2, Jze1in−1, whence
Jze1 = −λze1 mod Π. Similarly, substituting y = ei for i > 2 in (7) we obtain
he2, Jzeiin−1 = 0, whence Jzei = 0 mod Π for i > 2. Finally, since e2 = x is
an eigenvector, we have Jze2 = λze2. Hence, the matrix of the operator Jz ∈
End(n−1) in the chosen basis e1, e2, . . . , en has the form

that diﬀers from any matrix Jz ′′ unless λzλz ′ = λz ′′ = 0. Since for a generic
orthogonal pair z, z′ ∈ n−2, we have λz 6= 0, λz ′
6= 0 due to non-zero λz on n−2,
we obtain a contradiction. This proves the required rigidity of n.

5. Generic rigidity of 2-step nilpotent algebras

Let us discuss the general rigidity problem for graded 2-step nilpotent algebras
n = n−2 ⊕ n−1. Notice that if 0 ≤ dim n−2 ≤ 2, then the algebra n is of inﬁnite
type, see Section 3. So we study the algebras with dim n−2 > 2.

In this section we work with both real and complexiﬁed cases, so we omit

speciﬁcation of the ﬁeld and signature in the deﬁnition of so(n) below.

Denote by N(m, n) the space of 2-step graded nilpotent Lie algebras with bi-

dimensions (m, n), where m = dim n−2, n = dim n−1, 0 ≤ m ≤ (cid:0)n
is an algebraic manifold of dimension md, d = (cid:0)n

2(cid:1). This space
2(cid:1) − m, with the isomorphism to

the Grassmanian Grd(Λ2n−1) given by associating Z = ker(Λ2n−1 → n−2) to the
bracket on n. Reciprocally, n is restored by letting n−2 = Λ2n−1/Z. In particular,
the notion of a generic Lie algebra structure n ∈ N(m, n) is given by the notion
of a Zariski generic point Z ∈ Grd(Λ2n−1).

Theorem 3. A generic algebra n ∈ N(m, n) is rigid for m ≥ 3, n ≥ 3.

In other words, for a generic Lie bracket on n with the bi-dimensions in the
range m, n ≥ 3 the automorphism group of n is a Lie group. Before we give a proof
of this, let us notice that several authors have studied automorphisms of generic
2-step Carnot groups. In particular, let us mention the result by P. Pansu [38,
Proposition 13.1], asserting that in general, the automorphism group is generated
by translations adx, x ∈ n−1, and the standard homothety, action by the grading
element e ∈ n0 ⊂ ˆn, provided that n ∈ 2Z, n ≥ 10, 3 ≤ m < 2n − 3. The
restrictions on bi-dimensions were relaxed by P. Eberlein [18, Proposition 3.4.3],

where his assumption is that ¯d = min{m,(cid:0)n

for ¯d = 3. See also [26, 40, 42].

2(cid:1) − m} ≥ 3 excluding the cases n ≤ 6

When the stability subgroup of the automorphism group is only scaling due to
the grading element, the positive part of the Tanaka prolongation vanishes, which
yields the claim of our theorem. However, in order to overcome the restrictions
assumed by Pansu and Eberlein, we will give the proof valid for all pairs (n, m)
with the range speciﬁed. Outside this range all the algebras n are of inﬁnite type.
Notice that absence of rank 1 elements in the family {Jz : 0 6= z ∈ n−2} ⊂
End(n−1) is a Zariski open condition, so proving there exists one rigid Lie algebra
structure on n in bi-dimensions (m, n) implies the same for a generic one.

Proof. We will give two proofs of Theorem 3. First, let us remind that we work
in the complexiﬁcation. Using criterion (4), we have to show that generically, for
a basis z1 . . . , zm of n−2, the vectors Jz1x, . . . , Jzmx span the space of dimension
greater than 1 for all non-zero vectors x ∈ n−1. In other words, choosing a basis
in n−1, the n × m matrix M = [Jz1x| . . . |Jzmx] has rank less than or equal to 1
only if x = 0. In the case x = 0 the rank is indeed 0.

The ﬁrst proof is constructive. The condition rank (M) ≤ 1 means that all 2×2
minors vanish. Take independent minors M 1,j
for 1 < i ≤ n, 1 < j ≤ m. The
1,i
entries (linear in x) are at our disposal since we are free to perturb the operators
Jzj , so we get (n − 1)(m − 1) > n quadratic conditions on x ∈ n−1 whose common
solution is generically only zero, thus proving our claim.

has rank greater or equal than 2, whence this Lie algebra, as well as generic
nilpotent algebras n with (m, n) = (3, 5), are of ﬁnite type.

The second proof uses the fact that there exist three linearly independent op-
erators J1, J2, J3 ∈ so(n) such that any 2-dimensional subspace of their span
generates the whole Lie algebra so(n). Note that any 3 generic skew-symmetric
operators satisfy this property. Statements of this kind can be found in [7]. As-
sume that Jn−2 contains three operators Jz1, Jz2, Jz3 of the indicated type. Then
the intersection L† of the three-dimensional span{z1, z2, z3} ⊂ n−2 with the hy-
perplane L, used in criterion (4), has dimension 2 or 3. Since L† ⊂ L, there exists
a non-zero vector x ∈ n−1 satisfying Jzx = 0 for all z ∈ L†. However L† generates
the Lie algebra so(n), and thus, we get Ax = 0 for all A ∈ so(n), whence x = 0.
This contradiction proves the result.
(cid:3)

Let us remark that one can also consider moduli of Lie structures on n =
n−2 ⊕ n−1, i.e., quotient of N(m, n) by the natural action of GL(n) on n, induced
by the action on n−1. It is no longer a manifold, though the action is algebraic and
so allows a rational quotient on a Zariski open stratum by Rosenlicht’s theorem
[41], but it contains substrata of positive dimensions in the following cases:

• ¯d = min{m,(cid:0)n

2(cid:1) − m} ≥ 3, n ≥ 6, because dim sl(n) < dim Grm(so(n)).

The standard homothety acts trivially on the Grassmanian, so we consider
its quotient by the projective group PSL(n).

• ¯d = 2, n ∈ 2Z, n > 6, because of the following. The algebra structure
on n is given by two skew-symmetric operators Jz1, Jz2 on n−1, which are
generically non-degenerate. They are however not invariants of the Lie
algebra structure, but only of the chosen M-algebra: under the change
of metrics on n−2 and n−1 given by symmetric matrices B and A of sizes
2 × 2 and n × n respectively, the operator Jz changes to AJBz. Passage
to I = J −1
z1 Jz2 eliminates dependence on A, and the action of the M¨obius
group I 7→ a+bI
c+dI eliminates dependence on B. Since the spectrum of I
consists of double eigenvalues, so that generically without multiplicities
|I| = n/2, we obtain a continuous invariant.

RIGIDITY OF 2-STEP CARNOT GROUPS

11

In all other cases, there is an open orbit, and thus, no moduli for 2-step structures
n ∈ N(m, n). This is obvious if ¯d ≤ 1. In the remaining cases, the codimension
of the orbit of PSL(n) on Grm(so(n)) is

(9) dim Grm(so(n)) − dim sl(n) + d(m, n) = m ·(cid:0)n

2(cid:1) − m2 − n2 + 1 + d(m, n),

where d(m, n) is the dimension of the stabilizer of a generic point Z in the Grass-
mannian, or equivalently, the minimum of dimensions of stabilizers of all points,
which was computed in [18, Section 4.3]:

d(2, 2k + 1) = 2k + 4, d(2, 4) = 7, d(2, 6) = 9, d(3, 4) = 6, d(3, 5) = 3.

It is straightforward to check that the value in (9) is zero for these bi-dimensions,
and that it is positive for (2, 2k) since d(2, 2k) = 3k for k > 3.

We conclude generic rigidity on the moduli of highest dimension in the quotient

of N(m, n) by PSL(n).

6. Digression: rigidity vs. pseudo H-type

Let us at ﬁrst discuss the rigidity problem in lowest dimensions. The ﬁrst
non-trivial case is thus dim n−2 = 3. The fundamental property implies that
dim n−1 ≥ 3 and in the case of equality dim n−2 = dim n−1 = 3 the bracket
identiﬁes n−2 = Λ2n−1. It is well-known, see [8, 44], that the Tanaka prolongation
of n in this case is the simple Lie algebra of type B3 with the 2-grading induced
by the parabolic subalgebra p3. Namely, it is so(3, 4) in the real case or so(7, C)
in the complex case. Thus the algebra n with dim n−2 = dim n−1 = 3 is rigid.

The situation changes when dim n−2 = 3 and dim n−1 = 4. The classiﬁcation
of such graded 2-step Lie algebras, which can be extracted from [28], is as follows.
Let e1, e2, e3, e4 be a basis of n−1, and let f1, f2, f3 be that of n−2. The non-trivial
brackets of n in every of six non-isomorphic cases are given below. These cases are
numerated in loc.cit. as m7 2 2, m7 2 3, m7 2 4, m7 2 2r, m7 2 5 and m7 2 5r
respectively:

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

(15)

[e1, e4] = f1, [e2, e4] = f2, [e3, e4] = f3;

[e1, e4] = f1, [e2, e4] = f2, [e3, e4] = f3, [e2, e3] = f1;

[e1, e4] = f1, [e2, e3] = f2, [e3, e4] = f3;

[e1, e3] = [e4, e2] = f1, [e1, e4] = [e2, e3] = f2, [e3, e4] = f3;

[e1, e2] = [e3, e4] = f1, [e1, e4] = f2, [e2, e3] = f3;

[e1, e2] = [e3, e4] = f1, [e1, e3] = [e4, e2] = f2, [e1, e4] = [e2, e3] = f3.

Clearly in cases (10–12) rank(ade1) = 1, and for (13) we have to use the com-
plexiﬁcation rank(ade1+ie2) = 1, so the corresponding algebras n are of inﬁnite
type by the rank 1 criterion [15, 36]. On the contrary, in cases (14) and (15) the
algebras n are rigid. Indeed, in these cases they are isomorphic to the pseudo
H-type algebras n1,2 and n3,0 respectively. Thus, we conclude the following.

Proposition 3. The algebra n with (dim n−2, dim n−1) = (3, 4) is of ﬁnite type if
and only if it is of pseudo H-type.

12

M. GODOY MOLINA, B. KRUGLIKOV, I. MARKINA, A. VASIL’EV

The corresponding statement does not hold for n = dim n−1 > 4. Already for
(m, n) = (3, 5) we have rigid algebras n ∈ N(m, n) that are not of pseudo H-type.
A criterion for 2-step nilpotent Lie algebra to be of H-type was obtained in [31].
Indeed, there are no 5-dimensional representations without trivial modules for the
Cliﬀord algebra generated by a 3-dimensional scalar product space, see Table 1
in Section 7. More generally, we have

Theorem 4. Generic (rigid) algebras n ∈ N(m, n) in the range m > 1 (resp.
m > 2), with the exception of (m, n) ∈ {(2, 4), (3, 4)}, are not of pseudo H-type.

Proof. Any representation of the Cliﬀord algebra Cl(n−2, h. , .in−2) is decomposed
into a direct sum of irreducible modules. We have to exclude trivial submodules
which lead to inﬁnite type. Thus, ﬁrst of all, not every pair of bi-dimensions
(m, n) can be realized for a pseudo H-type algebra.

Second, if n−1 = ⊕k

i=1Ui is the sum of k irreducible modules, then k scalings
contribute to the choice of module, and hence, to ﬁxing the scalar product on n:
h. , .i = h. , .in−2 + h. , .in−1.

Next, changing the scalar product we keep the same Lie structure of n but
a diﬀerent J-representation as an M-type algebra. Namely, any other scalar
product, having decomposition n = n−2 ⊕ n−1 orthogonal, can be obtained via
two symmetric, not necessarily positive deﬁnite, operators A ∈ End(n−1) and
B ∈ End(n−2): h. , .inew = hA. , .in−1 + hB. , .in−2. The J-representation of the Lie
algebra structure changes so Jz   A ◦ JBz. The change of the basis z 7→ Bz in
n−2 does not inﬂuence the dimension of the space of pseudo H-type algebras in
N(m, n), while the symmetric operator A ∈ End(n−1) does contribute to it.

Alternatively, we can think of GL(n) changing the basis in n−1, inducing the
change in n−2. But since the orthogonal group preserves h. , .in−1, we obtain only

This follows by dimensional reasons similarly to the bi-dimension (3, 5) considered
before the theorem. Thus, we only have to study the cases (m, n) with 3 ≤ n ≤ 4,
which do not satisfy the above inequalities.

They are only the cases (2, 4), (3, 4) and (4, 4). The last one may not have any
pseudo H-type as it follows from Table 1 in the next section. But the ﬁrst two
both admit a pseudo H-type structure, and they are two exceptions: in the ﬁrst
case n is always of inﬁnite type, and in the second case it is generically of ﬁnite
type. This ﬁnishes the proof.
(cid:3)

An alternative approach to the proof of the above theorem for dim n−2 > 2 is
as follows. For pseudo H-type algebras, almost all operators Jzi are invertible,
and one can consider the operators Tij = J −1
zi Jzj for some generic choice of the
basis zi ∈ n−2. Similarly to how it was done in [31] for H-type algebras, one
can show that Tij generate a subalgebra of the even part Cl0(n−2, h. , .in−2) of the

Cliﬀord algebra. In particular, this subalgebra has dimension at most p = 2m−1.
2 ≤ n, we conclude
Since the minimal dimension of the Cliﬀord module is 2
that p ≤ n2 = dim End(n−1), where the inequality is strict unless n ≡ 7 mod 8.
Due to the results of [7] the operators Tij, obtained from generic operators Jk as
above, generate the whole endomorphism algebra End(n−1). Therefore, the claim
follows from the inequality p < n2 for n 6≡ 7 mod 8, and by comparison of the
structures of Cl0(n−2, h. , .in−2) with End(n−1) otherwise.

7. Pseudo H-type algebras with J 2-condition

This section is dedicated to studying pseudo H-type algebras satisfying the

J 2-condition.

Deﬁnition 6. Let J : Cl(U, h. , .iU) → End(V ) be a Cliﬀord algebra representa-
tion. The module V is called admissible if there is a bilinear form h. , .iV such
that the endomorphisms Jz are skew-symmetric for any z ∈ U, that is

(16)

hJzx, yiV = −hx, JzyiV .

This scalar product h. , .iV is called admissible for the module V .

It is well-known [23, 29] that if U is endowed with a positive deﬁnite bilinear
form h. , .iU , then the module V is admissible with respect to some positive deﬁ-
nite bilinear form h. , .iV . In particular, any irreducible module is admissible. In
the case when the bilinear form h. , .iU is indeﬁnite, the module V is not always
admissible, and sometimes only the direct sum V ⊕ V is admissible. As a conse-
quence, in this case not all irreducible modules are admissible. Notice also that
if (U, h. , .iU) is an indeﬁnite scalar product space, then any admissible module
will necessarily be a neutral space [10]. We call an admissible module of minimal
possible dimension the minimal admissible module.

In Table 1 we give the dimensions of the minimal admissible modules V r,s,
r, s ≤ 8. Dimensions of other minimal admissible modules can be obtained by
Bott’s periodicity, see [30]. The bold integers are used for the minimal admissible
modules which are direct product of two non-isomorphic irreducible Cliﬀord mod-
ules. Others denote the dimensions of minimal admissible modules, that are also
irreducible Cliﬀord modules. The notation ×2 means that there are two minimal
admissible modules, related to non-isomorphic irreducible modules.

As it was mentioned before, pseudo H-type Lie algebras are closely related
to Cliﬀord algebras. Namely, for a pseudo H-type Lie algebra n = (n−2 ⊕
n−1, h. , .in−1+h. , .in−2) one has the representation J : Cl(n−2, h. , .in−2) → End(n−1).
Conversely, for an admissible Cl(U, h. , .iU)-module (V, h. , .iV ), the representation
induces a graded 2-step nilpotent Lie algebra structure on n−2 ⊕ n−1 = U ⊕ V
deﬁning the Lie bracket by equation (1).

Let us assume that n satisﬁes the J 2-condition. If x ∈ n−1 and z, z′ ∈ n−2 is

any orthogonal pair satisfying

(17)

hJ˜zx, JzJz ′xin−1 = 0,

∀ ˜z ∈ n−2,

then hx, xin−1 = 0. Indeed

0 = hJ˜zx, JzJz ′xin−1 = hJ˜zx, Jz ′′xin−1 = h˜z, z′′in−2hx, xin−1.

Thus, to show that a pseudo H-type Lie algebra n does not satisfy the J 2-
condition it is enough to ﬁnd a vector x ∈ n−1, hx, xin−1 6= 0, and an orthogonal
pair z, z′ ∈ n−2 such that (17) holds.

Theorem 5. Only the following pseudo H-type algebras satisfy the J 2-condition:

(1) dim n−2 = 0: Rn.
(2) dim n−2 = 1: n1,0 and n0,1 for any admissible module.
(3) dim n−2 = 3: n3,0 and n1,2 for any isotypic module.
(4) dim n−2 = 7: n7,0 and n3,4.

Proof. We start by presenting a dimensional argument related to Table 1, which
shows that all pseudo H-type algebras nr,s with r + s 6= 0, 1, 3, 7, do not satisfy
the J 2-condition. Let us start by pointing out that if nr,s(V ), with a minimal
admissible module V , does not satisfy the J 2 condition, then no nr,s satisﬁes it.
Indeed, for any pseudo H-type algebra nr,s(V ), with a minimal admissible module
V , there exists an element x ∈ n−1 = V , hx, xin−1 = 1, such that the set

{x, Jzix, JziJzj x, JziJzj Jzkx, · · · }

contains an orthonormal basis of n−1, see [19].

Since Rx ⊕ Jn−2x is an admissible module, it cannot have dimension less than
the dimension of the minimal admissible module listed in Table 1. From this we
see that the Cliﬀord algebra Cl(n−2, h. , .in−2) can possess an admissible module
of the form Rx ⊕ Jn−2x of dimension r + s + 1 only when r + s = 0, 1, 3, 7. In other
words, if r + s 6= 0, 1, 3, 7, no pseudo H-type algebra nr,s admits the J 2-condition.
We focus now on the cases in which r + s = 0, 1, 3, 7. Let us ﬁx the numbering
of the elements of an orthonormal basis {z1, . . . , zr+s} of the center n−2 of any
pseudo H-type algebra nr,s in such a way that hzi, ziin−2 = 1 if i = 1, . . . , r and
hzi, ziin−2 = −1 if i = r + 1, . . . , r + s.

The J 2-condition is trivially satisﬁed for a pseudo H-type algebra n with

dim(n−2) = 0, 1.

Let dim n−2 = 3. A similar dimensional argument as before, using Table 1,
shows that the cases (r, s) ∈ {(2, 1), (0, 3)} do not satisfy the J 2-condition. For
(r, s) ∈ {(3, 0), (1, 2)}, we have (Jz1Jz2Jz3)2 = Idn−1. In these cases there are two

RIGIDITY OF 2-STEP CARNOT GROUPS

15

non-isomorphic irreducible 2-dimensional Cliﬀord modules V+ and V− of n−1,
where the endomorphism Ωr,s = Jz1Jz2Jz3 acts as the identity or minus the iden-
tity, respectively. In other words, the spaces V± are the eigenspaces of Ωr,s with
the eigenvalues ±1.
In both cases (r, s) ∈ {(3, 0), (1, 2)} the dimension of the
minimal admissible module is 4.

Case (r, s) = (1, 2). The minimal admissible module is either V+ ⊕ V+ or
V− ⊕ V−, see [19, 20].
It is necessary to point out that each module V+ and
V− is a null space, and by this reason we need to double them to guarantee
admissibility. It follows that neither of these direct sums is orthogonal. For an
orthonormal basis {z1, z2, z3} of n−2, we have

(18)




Jz1x = −Jz2Jz3x,
Jz2x = −Jz1Jz3x,
Jz3x = Jz1Jz2x,

for all x ∈ V+. The signs in (18) change to the opposite ones for x ∈ V−. Consider
n1,2(V+ ⊕ V+) = n−1 ⊕ n−2. Note that we could have chosen n1,2(V− ⊕ V−) instead,

but we would have obtained an isomorphic algebra. Choose any z = P3
and z′ = P3

(19)

i6=j

where z′′ is a linear combination of the orthonormal basis with coeﬃcients ±aibj,
i 6= j with the signs obtained by using (18). We conclude that the pseudo H-type
algebra n1,2(V+ ⊕ V+) satisﬁes the J 2-condition.

In the next step we allow the module n−1 to be non-minimal, but still ad-
missible. There are (potentially several) non-isomorphic pseudo H-type algebras
n1,2(V p,q) where n−1 = V p,q = (V+ ⊕ V+)⊕p ⊕ (V− ⊕ V−)⊕q is an orthogonal
sum of minimal admissible modules.
It is not hard to see that the Lie alge-
bras n1,2(V p,0) and n1,2(V 0,q) satisfy the J 2-condition. We refer to these cases
as isotypic. If p, q 6= 0, then the pseudo H-type Lie algebra n1,2(V p,q) does not

such that hx+, x+in−1 = hx−, x−in−1 6= 0. Then x = x+ + x− ∈ n−1 is such that
hx, xin−1 = 2hx+, x+in−1 6= 0. Then for the basis orthonormal vectors z1, z2 and

any z = P3

i=1 aizi we obtain by (18) that

hJz1Jz2x, Jzxin−1 = a3hJz1Jz2x, Jz3xin−1

The case (r, s) = (3, 0) is well known, see [10, 14], but still can be treated in a

similar manner as before, changing (18) to the following ordered product

±Jzix = (−1)iY

j6=i

Jzj x for all x ∈ V±.

Let dim n−2 = 7. A similar dimensionality argument as before, using Table 1,

shows that the cases (r, s) /∈ {(7, 0), (3, 4)} do not satisfy the J 2-condition.

Case (r, s) = (3, 4). There are two irreducible Cliﬀord modules V+ and V− of
dimension 8 that, in this case, are also admissible. They generate isomorphic

isometric to R4,4:

P1 = Jz1Jz2Jz4Jz5, P2 = Jz1Jz2Jz6Jz7, P3 = Jz1Jz3Jz5Jz7.

In Table 2 we show the commutation relations of these involutions with the maps
Jzi for i = 1, . . . , 7, where 1 appears if the operators Pj and Jzk commute, and
−1 if they anti-commute. Table 2 shows that there are eight orthogonal one-
dimensional common eigenspaces for the system of involutions P1, P2, P3.

then all Jziw belong to diﬀerent mutually orthogonal eigenspaces for P1, P2 and
P3. Therefore, for any pair JziJzj , i 6= j, there is k 6= i, j such that JziJzj (w) =
±Jzk(w). In Table 3 we show all these linear dependent vectors.

Choosing the basis

x1 = w,
x5 = Jz4w,

x2 = Jz3w,
x6 = Jz5w,

x3 = Jz6w,
x7 = Jz2w,

x4 = Jz7w,
x8 = Jz1w,

any x = P8

for any xp, p = 1, . . . , 8 and for any pair of indices i, j, there is an index k such
that JziJzj (xp) = ±Jzk (xp), where k might depend on i, j and xp. Therefore, for
p=1 λpxp, we again have JziJzj (x) = ±J˜z(x), where ˜z ∈ n−2 is a linear
combination of the basis vectors z1, . . . , z7. Now for any x ∈ n−1 and for any pair
of orthogonal vectors z, z′ ∈ n−2, we argue as in (19) and conclude that n3,4 with
the minimal admissible module satisﬁes the J 2-condition.

Let us show that n3,4 with the admissible module equal to the sum of two
minimal admissible modules based on the same irreducible module does not sat-
isfy the J 2-condition. This clearly extends to the isotypic modules. Thus we
assume for instance: n−1 = V1 ⊕ V2 with V1 = V2 = V+. Let x ∈ n−1 be of the

following form x = w1 + Jzkw2, where w1 ∈ E1,1,1 ∩ V1 and w2 ∈ E1,1,1 ∩ V2 and
k = 1 or 2. We assume that the admissible metric is such that hwα, wαiV+ > 0,
α = 1, 2, and normalizing we assume that w1, w2 are unit vectors. This implies
that hx, xin−1 6= 0. As a pair of orthogonal vectors from n−2 we take the basis

vectors z3 and z4. For an arbitrary vector z = P7
hJz3Jz4x, Jzxin−1 = DJz3Jz4(w1 + Jzkw2),

If the admissible metric h. , .in−1 is such that hw1, w1in−1 = −hw2, w2in−1, then
we modify the previous argument by changing the vector x ∈ n−1 to x = w1 +
Jzkw2, k = 5, 6 or 7.

Case (r, s) = (7, 0). Though this case is known in the literature, it can be

treated similarly to the case (3, 4) starting from the involutions.

P1 = Jz1Jz2Jz3Jz4, P2 = Jz1Jz2Jz5Jz6, P3 = Jz1Jz3Jz5Jz7

acting on the minimal admissible module n−1 isometric to R8.
