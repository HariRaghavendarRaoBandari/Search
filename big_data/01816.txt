Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate a ﬁber-integrated single photon
source of unprecedented efﬁciency. This ﬁber single photon source is
achieved by coupling optically a single quantum emitter to a monomode
optical ﬁber with a new concept of ultra-broadband optical antenna. Such
an optical antenna concept is the result of the transposition to optical
frequencies of the well-known low-frequency horn antenna The optical
horn antenna is here shown to be capable of directing the radiation from the
emitter toward the optical ﬁber and efﬁciently phase-matching the photon
emission with the ﬁber mode. Numerical results show that an optical horn
antenna can funnel up to 85% of the radiation from a dipolar source within
an emission cone semi-angle as small as 7 degrees (antenna directivity of
300). It is also shown that 50% of the emitted power from the dipolar source
can be collected and coupled to an SMF-28 ﬁber mode over spectral ranges
larger than 1000 nm, with a maximum energy transfer reaching 70 %. This
approach is highly promising in the engineering of all-ﬁber "‘on-demand"’
single photon sources for telecommunication, quantum optics and sensing.

1.

Introduction

Collecting and propagating photons from single quantum emitters (QE) over long distances
and complex optical networks is a key issue in quantum optics and metrology, and one that is
still highly challenging. Optical ﬁbers often appear to be the best solution to transmit photons
with minimum losses. The major problem which hinders the development of in-ﬁber propaga-
tion of the ﬂuorescence signal from nanoscale single emitters is the low coupling efﬁciency bet-
ween the omni-directional dipolar emission of the emitter and the low numerical aperture (NA)
of optical ﬁbers. Only a small part of the radiated photons can be collected and guided into the
ﬁber. For example, propagation of single photons from isolated quantum dots has been achieved
at telecom wavelengths with a source-ﬁber optical coupling lower than one percent [1]. Various
micro and nano-devices [2–9] have been proven to notably enhance the emission directivity of
single ﬂuorophores embedded in or attached to the structures. However, at least in these preli-
minary studies, efﬁcient light collection is achieved in free space through high-NA objectives

and the proposed devices do not seem to be well-adapted to efﬁciently launch and phase-match
photons into low-NA optical ﬁbers.

Recently, the evanescent coupling between optical ﬁbers and metallic wires [10] or semi-
conductor waveguides [11] has been proposed as an optical communication way to efﬁciently
transfer energy from single QEs to optical ﬁbers. Collection efﬁciencies as large as 70% into
both opposite propagation channels of a monomode optical ﬁber have been predicted with this
technique (35% heads upstream, and 35% downstream) [11]. In this paper, we introduce and
theoretically investigate an alternative approach, based on the transposition of the concept of the
microwave horn antenna (HA) to optical frequencies [12]. It is shown that the emission diagram
of the optical emitter coupled to the HA is highly directed toward the core of an optical ﬁber
and the photons launched within the ﬁber core are efﬁciently phase-matched with the optical
mode, leading to maximum collection efﬁciencies larger than 70 % into a single guided pro-
pagation channel of a monomode optical ﬁber. Spectral broadband operation is also predicted
with QE-to-ﬁber coupling efﬁciencies above 50 % over spectral bandwidths exceeding 1000 nm
in the near-infrared domain. Therefore, optical horn antenna may relax the spectral matching
requirements with narrow emission line nano-emitters and can be used across a large range of
emission wavelengths, making the optical HA of high practical interest in many applications
such as telecommunications.

2. Principle and optical antenna geometry

Horn antennas (HA) form a well-known family of versatile directional electromagnetic emit-
ters and receivers at microwave frequencies [12]. The HA transforms the impedance of a metal-
lic hollow waveguide to the impedance of free space (377 W
) simply by ﬂaring the waveguide
into a larger opening. Usually, the HA is fed with a coaxial cable thanks to a coax-to-waveguide
transition and the overall structure (ﬂared waveguide+coax-to-waveguide transition) is also of-
ten called HA. This work will focus onto this HA conﬁguration, sketched in Fig. 1(a). It consists
of a piece of monomode metallic hollow waveguide, closed at one end by a reﬂector (metal),
ﬂaring into an open-ended conical or pyramidal shaped horn at the other end. The structure is
fed with the central conductor of the coaxial cable which protrudes within the waveguide. This
short piece of thin protruding wire is placed in between the mirror and the tapered waveguide
and radiates within the waveguide as a subwavelength (dipolar) microwave source. The distance
between the mirror and the feed is generally close to l g/4 where l g is the effective wavelength
of the waveguide mode. This optimum distance is deﬁned precisely from a complex analysis of
impedance matching between the coax and the waveguide and is found empirically as a function
of the length of source wire [13]. A general rule is that a l /4 protruding source wire placed wi-
thin a waveguide of square section induces a maximum radiation in free space through the HA
when it is set at l g/4 from the reﬂector. The basic principle of the HA is that the back-reﬂected
radiation along the closed channel interferes constructively with the radiation that propagates
directly toward the open channel, leading to an overall radiation pattern directed outside of the
waveguide. Then, the tapered horn provides a gradual transition structure to match the impe-
dance of the waveguide to the vacuum. Note that high directivity and impedance-matching are
achieved for tapered waveguides of aspect ratios (length/aperture size) that are high enough to
induce output waves with nearly constant phase across the aperture (planar wavefronts).

We show here that the transposition to optics of this antenna concept can bring an innovative
solution to achieve directive emissions from nanoscale light sources which efﬁciently match
the impedance of single mode ﬁbers. The proposed antenna conﬁguration, depicted in Fig.
1(b), consists of the combination of a tapered dielectric microtip and a gold mirror. These two
elements correspond to the ﬂaring waveguide and the reﬂector of the HA shown in Fig. 1(a),
respectively. A point-like optical source (ﬂuorescent molecule, colloidal quantum dot, etc) with

FIGURE 1. (a) Scheme of the microwave horn antenna (b) Scheme of the ﬁber-integrated

performances of the optical antenna.

transition dipole moment oriented perpendicularly to the axis of symmetry of the HA (parallel
to the mirror interface) is placed in between the mirror and the tapered dielectric microtip,
in contact of the rounded apex of the microtip. The nanoscale emitter is not embedded in a
dielectric nanowire as it could be imagined in a direct transposition to optics of the HA concept.
We rather exploit the ability of dielectric interfaces to modify the dipolar radiation pattern of
QEs [5, 14] to couple photons from the emitter to the tapered waveguide. Note that the use of
metallic hollow waveguides does not seem to be technologically realistic at optical frequencies
and the lossy nature of metals at this spectral range may induce dissipation of the optical energy
and therefore limit the quantum efﬁciency. This conﬁguration of HA can be placed in contact
to the cleaved entrance facet of an optical ﬁber (called p -plane in the following).

3. Simulation

We cascade two different numerical approaches to model the radiation and ﬁber-coupling
processes of our HA prototype. The ﬁrst HA collection step (light scattering by the QE inserted
in the antenna and photon channeling within the ﬂaring dielectric waveguide) is numerically
investigated using the BOR-FDTD method (Body-of-Revolution Finite Difference Time Do-
main) [15]. The QE is here approximated by a two-level system whose emission transition is
governed by a pure electric dipole moment. Its radiation properties can be obtained using the
semiclassical approach in the weak-coupling regime by treating the emitter as a classical dipole
oscillating at the transition frequency w
[16]. In the following, the QE is assumed to be a perfect
emitter with an intrinsic quantum yield of 1. It is deﬁned numerically by a ﬁxed current density
at a single cell of the simulation meshgrid. The BOR-FDTD method is limited to the modeling
of rotationally symmetric structures with point-like sources positioned along their symmetry
axis. The optical ﬁelds are then calculated in cylindrical coordinates (r,q ,z) under the form
f(r,z)exp[imq ], where m ∈ N. Constant m is the rotational symmetry order of the simulation
deﬁned by the electromagnetic spatial symmetry of the source. In our case, the excitation of the
HA with an oscillating dipole oriented along the plane (r,q ) perpendicular to the symmetry axis
(0z) of the structure imposes m = 1, leading to the simulation of linearly-polarized transverse
ﬁelds. The ﬂaring dielectric waveguide on which the QE is attached is placed at a distance h
from the mirror (Fig. 1). Its refractive index (n) and length (L) are chosen to be equal to 1.52 and
42 microns, respectively. Its radius of curvature (R) is chosen to be a few hundred nanometers
large to efﬁciently outcouple photons from the dipole source into its tapered body. Dispersion

within the dielectric horn is neglected whereas the dielectric constant of the metallic mirror is
deﬁned by a Drude model that ﬁts the dielectric constant of gold at l = 1.55 microns given by
Palik’s book [17]. Since the computation volume terminates at the end facet of the dielectric
horn, the ﬁelds calculated at its upper limit can be directly used for the calculation of the mode
coupling into a ﬁber. The second step, of the HA-to-ﬁber optical coupling, is simulated with the
well-known overlap integral method [18]. Note that the reﬂection at the p -plane is not included
in our antenna model. Since the index difference between the dielectric horn and the optical
ﬁber does not exceed 0.053, the reﬂectance at the p -plane (of the order of 4 10−4) is small
enough to be neglected.

The photon transfer from the QE to the optical ﬁber is described by coefﬁcient T deﬁned as :

T = qh Cm,

(1)

where q is the quantum yield of the emitter, h

is the collection efﬁciency of the HA and Cm
is the coupling efﬁciency between the photons that leave the HA and the ﬁber mode. Factor
T represents the ratio of emitted photons that are collected by the HA and outcoupled into the
ﬁber mode. q is obtained from :

q =

g r

g r + g nr

,

(2)

where g r and g nr are the radiative and non radiative decay rates of the QE. We have g r = Pr/P0
and g nr = Pnr/P0 where Pr is the power radiated in free space by the emitter coupled to the HA,
Pnr is the power dissipated by the HA, and P0 is the power radiated by the emitter in free space
without the presence of the antenna.

The collection efﬁciency (h ) of the HA is deﬁned as the fraction of radiated power that is

channeled within the body of the ﬂaring dielectric waveguide. It is obtained from :

h =

Pi
Pr

(3)

where Pi is the power collected by the HA.

The energy transfer between the collected photons that leave the HA and the ﬁber mode can

be described in terms of the coupling coefﬁcient Cm, deﬁned as :

Cm = Pm/Pi

(4)

where Pm and Pi are the powers carried by the ﬁber mode and the collected optical ﬁeld that
leaves the HA, respectively. Pm and Pi are obtained from Poynting vector integrations over
speciﬁc areas in the p -plane :

Here the unit vector ~ez deﬁnes the direction of the ﬁber axis, and the expressions of constants
am and bm are based on the overlap integrals between the collected ﬁelds that leave the HA
(~Ei, ~Hi) and the mode ﬁeld distribution (~Em, ~Hm) :

(8)

In these simulations, a SMF-28 optical ﬁber is considered (single mode at telecommunication
wavelengths) whose core diameter is 8.2 m m. Its core and cladding indices are deduced from the
mode optical parameters given in the ﬁber datasheet. For accurate simulation of the HA optical
properties, the lateral extent of the FDTD computation volume was chosen to be wide enough
(15 microns along the radial coordinate) that the captured ﬁeld distributions were signiﬁcantly
wider than the lateral extent of the ﬁber core.

Another critical parameter that describes the performances of optical HAs (and antennas in

general) is the directivity, deﬁned as [12] :

Dir = max(cid:18) 4p P(b ,q )

Pr

(cid:19) ,

(9)

where P(b ,q ) is the angular power radiated in the direction of polar angle b and azimuthal
angle q , and Pr =RR P(b ,q )sinb db dq
is the integral over all angles. An isotropic source would

have a directivity of 1, whereas for a dipolar emitter Dir=1.5.

4. Results and discussions

First, let us focus onto the collection properties and directivity of the optical HA. The blue
and red curves of Fig. 2(a) show the fraction of radiated power Pout(r)/Pr that crosses the output
p -plane of two different HA geometries, as a function of the bounding radial space coordinate
r. Pout(r) is the power transmitted inside the circular area of radius r contained in the p -plane.
The origin of coordinate r is thus the intersection point between the p -plane and the symmetry
axis of the optical HA. The two HA geometries are given in the ﬁgure inset and the wavelength
l
is equal to 1450 nm. We see that the two HAs collect 80% and 85% of the total power radiated
by the dipole source, respectively. The two vertical dotted lines represent the lateral limit in the
p -plane of the two dielectric horns considered here (lines positioned at D/2). As a comparison,
the green curve of Fig. 2(a) represents Pout(r)/Pr achieved in the p -plane without the presence
of HA (free space dipole emission). The collection and emission properties of the optical HA
are also revealed in Fig. 2(b) which plots the spatial distribution of the real part of the electric
ﬁeld that propagates along the longitudinal plane (r,z) that contains the dipole source and the
ﬁrst 16 microns of the dielectric horn. The real part of the electric ﬁeld is represented to show
the amplitude and phase properties of the waves that are channeled within the dielectric horn.
The conﬁguration of optical HA under consideration here is detailed under the ﬁgure. We see
that the propagating optical ﬁeld within the ﬂaring dielectric waveguide show planar wavefronts
and its amplitude distribution is of gaussian-like shape. This is conﬁrmed by Fig. 2(a) which
show accumulated powers in the p -plane as gaussian-like functions of the radial coordinate.
Such ﬁeld properties may insure highly directive propagations in free space or in optical ﬁbers.
Figures 2(c,d) display the free-space emission diagrams P(b ,q ) of the two HA geometries
of interest (detailed in the ﬁgure insets). The emission diagrams are plotted at l = 1450 nm

deﬁning the two perpendicular longitudinal planes (y,z) and (x,z), respectively. The dipole,
represented in green in the ﬁgures, is oriented along (0x). In these simulations, the optical HA
is not considered to be in contact to the optical ﬁber but to emit directly in vacuum. Figures
2(c,d) show that the photons collected by the two HA conﬁgurations are radiated within cone
semi-angles of 12◦ (red curves) and 13.5◦ (blue curves), with antenna directivities of 160
and 230, respectively (Eq. 9). We found a maximum directivity of 300 related to an emission
cone semi-angle of 7◦. Following the principle of microwave HAs, the optical HA is able to
efﬁciently convert dipolar emission into extremely directive radiations that can be efﬁciently
outcoupled into free space mode continuum or discrete ﬁber modes.

FIGURE 3. (a,b) collection efﬁciency h as a function of l and the dipole-to-mirror distance
h, for the two different HA geometries considered in Fig. 2(a) (detailed in the ﬁgure insets).

Since the power collected by the HA is conﬁned within the tapered waveguide (see Fig. 3(a)),
the collection efﬁciency h
(Eq. 3) will be deﬁned as Pout(r = D/2)/Pr, ie. Pi (Eq. 3) will be
calculated by Poynting vector integration through the microtip output cross-section. Coefﬁcient
h
is reported in Figs. 3(a,b) as a function of the dipole-to-mirror spacing (h) for two HA geo-
metries deﬁned in the ﬁgure insets. The wavelength range spans in the near-infrared domain
from 1000 nm to 2000 nm and the spacing h ranges from 30 nm to 1270 nm. The collection
efﬁciencies of both HA geometries are oscillating functions of h and their local maxima and
minima are linear functions of l . The spacing h that induces maximum collection efﬁciency
(called hopt) is close to l /4 for both HA geometries, which is consistent with the empirical
rules of microwave HA design (the spacing h = l /4 is represented in the ﬁgures with white
dashed lines). The little mismatch between the optimum h values achieved for the two HA
conﬁgurations is the result of the complex optical mechanism between the dipolar source and
the optical HA that is strongly dependent on the HA geometrical parameters. Note that the
free space propagation phenomenon between the dipole and the mirror explains why the local
maxima of h are decreasing functions of h and increasing functions of the ratio R/l and why
the mismatch |hopt − l /4| is a increasing function R/l . It also explains why the optical HA
has a spectrally broadband operation compared to the microwave HA for which waveguiding
occurs between the feed and the reﬂector. We see from Fig. 3(b) that the collection efﬁciency h
can stay above 78% over the spectral domain 1000 nm-2000 nm with a maximum value larger
than 88% at l = 1000 nm. By comparing Figs. 2(d) and 3, we see that the optical HA is capable
of radiating in free space more than 85 % of the energy from a dipole source within an emission
cone semi-angle of 7◦ (corresponds to an antenna directivity of 300).

The outstanding collection and directivity performances of the optical HA could even be
increased by optimizing the shape for the dielectric horn and/or using a parabolic mirror. They
represent highly promising perspective in free space sensing applications and in the coupling
of QEs to optical ﬁbers. In the latter case, the directivity of the HA is not the only critical
parameter, but the phase matching ability of the HA to optical ﬁber is also crucial.

The ability of the optical HA to outcouple the collected photons into a SMF-28 monomode
optical ﬁber is presented in Fig. 4. This antenna property is described by coefﬁcient h Cm (see
section 3), which represents the fraction of radiated power from the dipole source that is collec-
ted by the HA and guided within the optical ﬁber. Figs. 4(a) and (b) show h Cm as a function of
l and h, for the two different HA geometries shown previously (see ﬁgure insets). Our calcu-
lation does not take into account the free space propagating photons that are projected onto the
entrance facet of the ﬁber and coupled to the ﬁber mode. Simulations that include this dipole-
to-ﬁber coupling channel show discrepancies in the energy transfer which do not exceed 1%.
Therefore, h Cm is a very good approximation of the probability that a photon radiated in free
space by a QE coupled with the optical HA is guided into the ﬁber.

FIGURE 4. (a,b) Part of the radiated power from the dipole source h Cm that is collected
and guided within the optical ﬁber by the two HA geometries detailed in the ﬁgure insets :
coefﬁcient h Cm as a function of l and h.

These results show that the maximum coupling efﬁciency between the dipole source and
the optical ﬁber can exceed 63 % (at l = 1450 nm) for the two particular HA geometries
studied here. h Cm remains slightly higher for the larger radius of curvature of the microtip
(R=750 nm). Such energy transfers are made possible by the ability of the HA to direct the
dipole emission and to project ﬁeld distributions onto the ﬁber entrance facet that tightly
overlap the ﬁber mode (gaussian-like proﬁle of the proper size and plane wavefronts). For both
HA geometries, the maximum dipole-to-ﬁber energy transfer is achieved for dipole-to-mirror
spacings h close to l /4, which is consistent with the operating principle of HAs.

Figure 5(a) reports the spectra of the total decay rate g tot and the quantum yield q of the HA
for the two HAs considered here (see ﬁgure insets). Since the energy transfer does not rely
on the interaction of the nano-emitter with a high quality factor and/or small mode volume
resonator, the emitter’s decay rate is not strongly enhanced (dashed curves) and is rather a
slowly increasing function of h/l
(result consistent with Ref. [19]). One main drawback of
the optical HA is that it can induce lower emission rates than free space when h/l becomes
too small. Fig. 5(a) shows for example that g tot < 1 when l > 1550nm, for the HA geometry

with R = 500nm and h = 290nm (blue dashed curve). Therefore, the radius of curvature at the
microtip apex has to be chosen in a way that the optimum spacing hopt is as large as possible
to avoid weak emission conﬁgurations. For example, the HA geometry with R = 750nm does
not hinder the emission rate of the QE over the spectral range considered in this study. The
quantum yield (solid curves) of the structure is however almost unaffected (in opposition to
metallic nano-antennas which dissipate optical energy) and the HA radiation process remains
efﬁcient over unprecedented spectral bandwidths of several hundreds nanometers.

lines) of the structure for the two HA geometries detailed in the ﬁgure inset.(b) spectrum of

spectrum of the overall photon transfer T from the QE to the optical ﬁber, for R = 750nm,
h = 390nm and 4 different values of parameter D ranging from 9000 nm to 12000 nm (see
inset of (b)).

Fig. 5 reports the overall photon transfer from the QE to the optical ﬁber as a function of the
ﬂaring angle of the dielectric waveguide. Figs. 5(b) and (c) show the spectra of parameter T ,
ie. the probability that a photon emitted by the QE is collected and guided within the optical
ﬁber (see Eq. 1), for two different pairs (R,h) given in the ﬁgure insets, respectively. For each
pair (R,h), the diameter D of the output interface of the ﬂaring dielectric waveguide is varied
from 9 m m to 12 m m by steps of 1 m m. D has to be chosen to match the width of the ﬁeld
distribution that leaves the optical HA to the width of the ﬁber mode. We see that the inﬂuence

of D, ie. the ﬂare angle of the microtip, onto parameter T is important. However, D is not
a predominant parameter in the HA-to-ﬁber coupling since the relationship between D and
T is strongly dependant on the other geometrical R and h. Therefore, a trade-off has to be
found between the geometrical parameters R, L and D of the ﬂaring dielectric waveguide to
optimize the photon transmission in the optical ﬁber. When R =500nm, h =290nm and D=10
m m , T remains above 50% for wavelengths spanning between 1000 nm and 2000 nm and
with a maximum value of about 65% at l =1400 nm (Fig. 5(b)). When R =750nm, h =390nm
and D=11 m m, T is larger than 50% for wavelengths ranging between 1000 nm and 2000 nm
and reaches a maximum value of about 70% at l =1220 nm. The HA conﬁguration involving
R =750nm and D=12 m m (gray curve of Fig. 5(c)) is of particular interest for applications in
telecommunications since it insures a ratio of guided photons into the ﬁber larger than 60%
over the spectral range 1280 nm-1750 nm with a maximum of 67% at l = 1430nm.

5. Conclusion

In summary, the optical horn antenna combines high collection efﬁciency, unprecedented
directivity and an excellent phase-matching ability with vacuum and optical ﬁbers. Since our
optical horn antenna is based on a lossless non-resonant optical mechanism, it can operate over
remarkably broad spectral bandwidths while keeping a quantum yield above 0.99. Such proper-
ties do not seem to be achievable with plasmonic nano-antennas. Similar to the microwave HA,
the optical HA needs to be large compared to the wavelength in order to provide its unique di-
rectivity and phase-matching properties. Therefore, it cannot compete, in terms of compactness,
with resonant directive subwavelength nano-antennas as the Yagi-Uda [20–22]. However, the
development of ﬁber bright nano-emitters or ﬁber nanosensors relaxes the size requirements of
the optical antenna which has to be attached onto the large scale ﬁber entrance facet. Therefore,
the use of ultra compact resonant antennas is not necessary here. Furthermore, these structures
do not seem to be well adapted to efﬁciently launch and phase-match photons to a ﬁber mode. In
that context, the optical horn antenna may provide a promising solution for integrating quantum
emitters to ﬁber networks for telecommunications, quantum optics and sensing applications. It
can also achieve ultra directive emissions in free space which is attractive in the development
of directed bright nanoscale light sources for quantum optics and sensing applications. For
example, this work paves the way toward the generation of ﬁber-integrated on-demand single
photon sources, for which the low-loss and wide-band photon transfer provided by the optical
horn antenna are of particular interest.
