The Sobolev moment problem and Jordan dilations

Franciszek Hugon Szafraniec and Micha l Wojtylak

Abstract. Moment problems and orthogonal polynomials, both meant in a
single real variable, belong to the oldest problems in Classical Analysis. They
have been developing for over a century in two parallel, mostly independent
streams. During the last 20 years a rapid advancement of polynomials orthog-
onal in Sobolev space has been noticed, see [5] for an updated survey; their
moment counterpart seems to be not paid enough attention as it deserves. In
this paper we intend to resume the theme of [3] and also [4], and open the
door for further, deeper study of the problem.

1. Opening. Given a sequence (a(n))∞

n=0 of numbers, the classical (named after
Hamburger) moment problem asks under which conditions there is a nonnegative Borel
measure µ on R such that

a(n) = ZR

tnµ(d t), n = 0, 1, . . .

(1)

This happens if and only if

a(k + l)ξm ξn > 0,

ξn = 0 but a ﬁnite numebr of n’s.

Xk,l

The above is referred to as positive deﬁniteness of the matrix 1 (a(k + l))∞
k,l=0, which in
turn can be viewed as positive deﬁniteness of n → a(n) considered as a function on the
involution semigroup 2 N. The important feature of the above is translational invariance

a(m + k, b) = a(m, n + k) for all k ∈ N

of the Hankel matrix (a(m, n))∞
the right hand side of (1). This allows to make use of harmonic analysis ideas on involution
semigroups combined with operator dilation theory as successfully done in [17].

where superscript (i) designates the i-th derivative. Call it the Sobolev moment problem
as the integral on the right hand side of (2) is of Sobolev type. A bisequence s enjoying
the property (2) will be called a Sobolev moment sequence.

To be more precise, positive deﬁniteness of the matrix µ does not exclude some of
its entry measures µi,j to be signed or complex, (cf. [9] for complex measures) though it
forces the diagonal entries µi,i, i = 0, 1 to be positive measures anyway. However, due to
positive deﬁniteness of the matrix µ (cf. the explanation in footnote 4) such a measure
can be always viewed as a semispectral 5 one in C2 (cf. [6, Theorem 4 p. 30 ]).

By a semispectral measure in our context we mean a 2 × 2-matrix valued function
µ deﬁned on Borel subsets of R, which is countably additive (all the two possibilities: in
strong and week operator topology, are equivalent in this case to the entry-wise conver-
gence). A semispectral measure becomes spectral if it is orthogonal projection valued.

The following result known as Na˘ımark dilation theorem turns out to be useful in the

further developments.

Theorem 1 (cf. [6], p. 30). A 2 × 2 matrix (µi,j )1

i,j=0 of measures on R is positive
deﬁnite if and only if there is a Hilbert space K, and a bounded linear operator R : C2 → K
and a spectral measure E in K such that

(µi,j (ρ))1

i,j=0 = R∗E(ρ)R,

ρ a Borel subset of R.

(3)

Remark 2. In general R∗R = (µi,j (R))∞
jection of K onto C2 if and only if (µi,j (R))1

i,j=0; in particular, R∗ is the orthogonal pro-
i,j=0 = diag(1, 1).

Notice that (3) is equivalent to

µi,j ( · ) = hE( · )Rei, Rej i,

i, j = 0, 1

with

e0

def=(1, 0) and e1

def=(0, 1)

(4)

standing for the basic vectors in C2.

Proposition 3. If (s(m, n))∞

m,n=0 is a Sobolev moment bisequence then it is positive

deﬁnite, that is

Xm,n

λm λns(m, n) > 0,

(λm,n)n,n of ﬁnite length.

(5)

Positive deﬁniteness (5) is the same as positive deﬁniteness of the scalar valued kernel
s(m, n), m, n deﬁned on N × N, cf. [12, 13, 14]. Though (5) looks very innocent, it needs
to be provided with some argument.

4 Positive deﬁniteness of the 2 × 2 matrix valued function (µi,j ( · ))1

i,j=0 deﬁned on Borel
i,j=0 is positive

subsets of R means for every Borel ρ the 2 × 2 scalar entry matrix (µi,j (ρ))1
deﬁnite.

where in the passage s= multiplicativity of the spectral integral is used. This establishes
(5).
(cid:3)

3. The basis decomposition. The bisequence (s(m, n))∞

m,n=0 is no longer transla-
tionally invariant (in Hankel sense) unlike in the case of the Hamburger moment problem.
Another, not translationally invariant “moment problem” on the real line R is treated 6 in
[7]. There a dilation argument is exploited as well.

The integral representation (2) of (s(m, n))∞

m,n=0 suggests the following decomposition

(whenever a negative argument appears the corresponding entry is valued to 0)

s(m, n) = s0.0(m, n) + ms0,1(m − 1, n)

+ ns1,0(m, n − 1) + (m − 1)(n − 1)s1,1(m − 1, n − 1)

as well as the properties

s0,0(m, n) = s0,0(m + n, 0) = s0,0(0, m + n)

s0,1(m, n) = s0,1(m + n, 0) = s0,1(0, m + n)

s1,0(m, n) = s1,0(m + n, 0) = s1,0(0, m + n)

s1,1(m, n) = s1,1(m + n, 0) = s1,1(0, m + n)

(6)

(7)

If a bisequence s satisﬁes the properties (6) and (7) then for a = (a0, a1), b = (b0, b1) ∈

C2 and m, n ∈ N consider

s(m, n, a, b)def=aa¯b0s0,0(m, n) + a0¯b1s0,1(m, n) + a1¯b0s1,0(m, n) + a1¯b1s1,1(m, n).

(8)

Consequently s is a form over N2 × C4 (also thought of as (N × C2)2 after permuting the
variables) in the sense already deﬁned and considered in [12]. Therefore the notion of
positive deﬁniteness of a form as done [12] applies. More precisely, s is a positive deﬁnite
form if

s(mk, ml, ak, al) > 0

for any ﬁnite choice of sequences (mk)k and (ak)k.

(9)

Xk,l

A statement analogous to Proposition 3 is valid.

Proposition 4. If (s(m, n))∞

m,n=0 is a Sobolev moment bisequence and

si,j(m, n) def=ZR

tm+nµi,j (d t),

i, j = 0, 1

(10)

then the function s : N × N × C2 × C2 → C deﬁned by (8) is a positive deﬁnite form.

6 This is a cosine moment problem, not a power one like those commonly considered, so it

“continuous” in a sense.

with ak = (a0,k, a1,k) and K, E and R as before.

Conditions (7) are equivalent to translational invariance of s on N × N, that is to

s(m, n, a, b) = s(m + n, 0, a, b) = s(0, m + n, a, b), m, n = 0, 1, . . .

(11)

which is the same as

s(m + k, n, a, b) = s(m, n + k, a, b), m, n, k = 0, 1, . . .

(12)

All this creates an ideal excuse to consider for the 2 × 2 matrix (s(m, n, a, b))∞

m,n=0
the moment problem of Hamburger type. We implement this by making use of dilation
theory of Hilbert space operators conveniently carried out in the RHKS environment.

4. The RKHS buildup. As mentioned earlier positive deﬁniteness (9) makes it
possible to introduce the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and consider operators therein.
Deﬁne the sections sssm(n,b) and their linear span D as

s(n,b)

def= s( · , n, −, b), D def= lin{s(n,b) : (n, b) ∈ N × C2}

and equipped D with an inner product extended from 7

hs(n,b), s(m,a)i def= s(m, n, a, b).

(13)

(14)

The reproducing kernel Hilbert space H determined by (14) is composed of complex
valued functions on N × C2 whereas the reproducing property (restricted to D which is a
dense subspace of H) is precisely

s(n,b)(m, a) = hs(n,b), s(m,a)i,

which is just the deﬁnition of the inner product read `a rebours.

Fix k ∈ N and set for (n, b) ∈ N × C2

(Φ(k)s(n,b))(m, a) def= s(n,b)(k + m, a),
def= s(n+k,b)

Ψ (k)s(n,b)

(m, a) ∈ N × C2

(15)

(16)

(17)

deﬁned so far for s(n,b)’s. Notice Ψ (k) extends linearly to the whole of D as an operator.

Fortunately, and exclusively in this case,

hs(m,a), Ψ (k)s(n,b)i

(17)
= hs(m,a), s(n+k,b)i

(15)
= s(m,a)(n + k, b)

(13)
= s(n + k, m, b, a)

(12)
= s(n, m + k, b, a)

(13)
= s(m+k,a)(n, b)

(16)
= Ψ (k)sm,a(n, b)

(15)
= hΨ (k)s(m,a), s(n,b)i,

7 Notice s(n,b) is antilinear in b.

THE SOBOLEV MOMENT PROBLEM

5

which implies Ψ (k) is symmetric. Furthermore

Φ(k)s(n,b)(m, a)

(17)
= s(n,b)(k + m, a)

(13)
= s(n+k,b)(m, a)

(17)
= Ψ (k)s(n,b)(m, a).

(18)

which means Φ(k) = Ψ (k) on D. As a consequence Φ(k) extends to a linear operator as
well.

Both, Φ(k) and Ψ (k) are the standard, naturally deﬁned operators in a RKHS.

5. Jordan operators in the RKHS H. With notation (4) in mind consider an

operator N deﬁned on D as the linear extension of the formula

N s(n,b)

def= b0s(n,e1).

Set T

def= Φ(1); because the mapping k → Φ(k) is a semigroup homorphism on N to

linear operators on D we have T k = Φ(k). Apparently,

and

N commutes with T on D

N 2 = 0 on D, that is N is nilpotent.

(19)

(20)

Due to (19) and (20), the (commutative) Newton’s binomial formula is applicable and
reduces to

(T + N )k = T k + k T k−1N on D.

(21)
This motivates the following state of aﬀair. Given an arbitrary Hilbert space K, say 8
call an operator of the form T + N where T is symmetric and N is such that N 2 = 0, and
T and N commute on a dense subspace D of K, invariant for both and being a core of
each of them, a Jordan operator of order 2; the case when both of T and N are bounded
is considered in [2]. Furthermore, call the couple T and N a Jordan dilation of s relative
to the decomposition (6) if

s(m, n) = h(T + N )mV (1, 0), (T + N )nV (1, 0)iK, m, n = 0, 1, . . .

(22)

where V : C2 → D is an isometry, and

s(l, k, b, a) = hT kV b, T lV ai,

k, l ∈ N, a, b ∈ C2.

6. The basic result. Let us isolate the following condition

there are four bisequences (si,j(m, n))∞

m,n=0, i, j = 0, 1 with

the properties (7) and such that the bisequence s decomposes as in (6)

(23)

(24)

Theorem 5. Given (s(m, n))∞

m,n=0. The following conditions are equivalent:

(i) the condition (24) is satisﬁed and s deﬁned by (8) is a positive deﬁnite form;
(ii) the condition(24) is satisﬁed and there is a Jordan dilation T , N of the bise-

quence s relative to the decomposition (6);

(iii) s is a Sobolev moment bisequence.

Proof. Most of the arguments have been already presented in the constructions

above. Let us put them together.

(i) =⇒ (ii). Use the constructions done in sections 4 and 5 maintaining the notation

applied there. Consider the standard imbedding

V : C2 ∋ a 7→ s0,a ∈ H.

It is a matter of straightforward though lengthy veriﬁcation that

s(m, n) = h(T + N )mV (1, 0), (T + N )nV (1, 0)iH, m, n = 0, 1 . . .

(25)

which is nothing but (22) under the speciﬁc circumstances considered there.

8 Notice now the space may be not be the same as the above hence the notation is diﬀerent

6

F.H. SZAFRANIEC AND M. WOJTYLAK

Indeed, due to (21), (6) and (14),

h(T + N )mV (1, 0), (T + N )nV (1, 0)i

= h(T m + mT m−1N )V (1, 0), (T m + mT m−1N )V (1, 0)i

= hT ms(0,e0), T ns(0,e0)i + nhT ms(0,e0), T n−1s(0,e1)i + mhT m−1s(0,e0), T ns(0,e1)i

+ mnhT m−1s0,e1 , T n−1s0,e1 i

= hs(m,e0), s(n,e0)i + nhs(m,e0), s(n−1,e1)i + mhs(n−1,e0), s(0,e1)i + mnhsm−1,e1 , sn−1,e1 i
= s(n, m, e0, e0) + ns(n − 1, m, e1, e0) + ms(n, m − 1, e0, e1) + mns(n − 1, m − 1, e1, e1)

= s0,0(m, n) + ms0,1(m − 1, n) + ns1,0(m, n − 1) + mns1,1(m − 1, n − 1) = s(m, n).

Remark 6. The formula (25) becomes our basic dilation statement.

(ii) =⇒ (iii). Because V ∗ is a projection onto a 2-dimensional space T can be rep-
resented by 2 × 2-matrix valued semispectral measure µ (which is a compression 9 to the
2-dimensional space of a spectral measure of any selfadjoint extension 10 of T ) as

s(l, k, b, a) = hT kV b, T lV ai = ZR

tk+lhµ(d t)b, ai.

(26)

Because V ei ⊥ V ej (V is an isometry!) if i 6= j and lin(s(n,b))(n,b) is invariant for T ,

we have the decomposition

µ1,0( · ) µ1,1( · )(cid:19) def=(cid:18) hµ( · )e0, e0i
(cid:18) µ0,0( · ) µ0,1( · )

hµ( · )e1, e0i

hµ( · )e0, e1i

hµ( · )e1, e1i(cid:19)

(27)

Again, with some eﬀort,

h(T + N )mV (1, 0), (T + N )nV (1, 0)i

= hT ms(0,e0), T ns(0,e0)i + nhT ms(0,e0), T n−1s(0,e1)i + mhT m−1s(0,e0), T ns(0,e1)i

+ mnhT m−1s0,e1 , T n−1s0,e1 i

= s(n, m, e0, e0) + ns(n − 1, m, e1, e0) + ms(m − 1, n, e0, e1) + mns(m − 1, n − 1, e1, e1)

(26)(27)

= Z Rtmtnµ0,0(d t) + nZR

tmtn−1µ0,1(d t) + mZR

tm−1tnµ1,0(d t)

+ mnZR

which confronted with (25) establishes

s(m, n) = X1

i,j=0ZR

tm

(i)

tn

(j)

µi,j (d t), m, n = 0, 1, . . .

(iii) =⇒ (i). This is the easiest implication if one takes into account (10). The inte-
gral representation (10) generates the decomposition (6), hence makes the deﬁnition (8)
possible. This, in turn, settles (i).
(cid:3)

7. Compactly supported representing measures µ. For a measure µ such that
(26) holds to be compactly supported it is necessary and suﬃcient the operator T therein
to be bounded. For that there is a number of equivalent conditions in terms of s which
are applicable here due to the fact that it is a translationally invariant form in the sense of
(11) or (12). The conditions are listed in [15, Lemma 2] and are originated in [10, 11, 12].
Let us pick up some of them explicitely.

Proposition 7. The following conditions are equivalent to the boundedness of T

9 This is when the formula (3) is read “right-to-left” with R being an isometry.
10 Selfadjoint extensions may be quite diverse, often not necessarily unitary equivalent, cf.

[1] and also [16].

• for every k = 0, 1, . . . there is d(k) such that

8. Boundedness of the operator N .

Theorem 8. Suppose one of the equivalent conditions of Theorem 5 holds. Then the

operator N is bounded if and only if for some α > 0 the kernel

tα(m, n, a, b)def=a0¯b0(αs0,0(m, n) − s1,1(m, n))

+αa0¯b1s0,1(m, n) + αa1¯b0s0,1(m, n) + αa1¯b1s1,1(m, n)

(28)

is a positive deﬁnite form on N2 × C4, cf. (9).

Proof. The operator N is bounded if and only if

hN f, N f i ≤ αhf, f i,

f = Xk

s(mk ),ak ∈ D

for some α > 0. This in turn is equivalent to

αXk,l

hs(mk ,ak), s(ml ,al)i −Xk,l

a0,k¯a0,lhs(mk ,e1)s(ml,e1)i ≥ 0

and the left hand side of the above inequality can be written as

Xk,l

(αs(ml, mk, al, ak) − a0,k¯a0,ls(ml, mk, e1, e1)) = Xk,l

tα(ml, mk, al, ak).

(cid:3)

Remark 9. If

s0,0(m, n) = s1,1(m, n) and s0,1(m, n) = s1,0(m, n) = 0, m, n = 0, 1, . . .

then the form deﬁned in (28) with α = 1 is obviously positive deﬁnite. Hence N is always
bounded in this case; confront this with Example 11.

Corollary 10. A necessary condition for boundedness of N is that

Proof. Indeed, note that

sup

n≥0 R t2ndµ11
R t2ndµ00

< +∞.

kN s(n,a)k2 = |a0|2kse1,mk2 = |a0|2Z t2m d µ11

and

ks(n,a)k2 = |a0|2Z t2m d µ00 + 2ℜ(cid:18)a0¯a1Z t2m d µ01(cid:19) + |a1|2Z t2m d µ11.

(29)

(30)

(31)

Hence, if N is bounded then setting a1 = 0 we get by (30) and (31) that (29) is satisﬁed.
(cid:3)

We present an example, showing that N is not automatically bounded even in the

case when the oﬀ-diagonal measures µ01 and µ10 are zero.

8

F.H. SZAFRANIEC AND M. WOJTYLAK

Example 11. Let µ01 and µ10 be zero measures and let d µ11(t) = t2k d µ00(t) with
some k ≥ 0. Then it is a matter of straightforward veriﬁcation that sm,b ∈ D(N ∗) for all
m ∈ N and b ∈ C2 and

If now µ00 is the Gaussian measure with variance one, then

N ∗s(m,b) = b1s(e0 ,m+2k).

R t2n d µ11
R t2n d µ11

= R t2n+2k d µ00
R t2n d µ00

=

(2n + 2k − 1)!!

(2n − 1)!!

→ ∞ (n → ∞).

Hence, the necessary condition (29) is violated and consequently N must not be bounded 11,
although D ⊆ D(N ∗).

The above, when compared with what is in Section 7, shows that boundedness of T

seem to have very little in common with that of N .

9. Helton’s condition. For (s(m, n))∞

m,n=0 consider the following condition

s(m + 3, n) − 3s(m + 2, n + 1) + 3s(m + 1, n + 2) − s(m, n + 3) = 0, m, n ∈ N.

(32)

An operator theoretic master of (32) can be found in [2, condition (1.2a), p. 309] however
the circumstances there are rather limited.

Let C[N] stands for the linear space of of complex ﬁnitely supported functions on
N considered point-wisely and C[N × N] that of ﬁnitely supported functions on [N × N].
The Kronecker deltas δn and δm,n are apparently members of C[N] and C[N × N], respec-
tively. We naturally embed N in C[N] as n 7→ δn; therefore a ∈ C[N] can be written as

Pn∈N a(n)δn; for technical reasons set δ−1 = δ−2 = 0.

Clearly

s†(a) def= Xm,n∈N

a(m, n)s(m, n),

a ∈ C[N × N].

s(m, n) = s†(δm,n).

Moreover if we consider C[N] as the commutative algebra with the standard convolu-

tion

(a ∗ b)(n) = Xx+y=n

a(x)b(y),

a, b ∈ C[N]

the condition (32) turns out to be equivalent to

with

s†(p1 ∗ δm,n) = 0, m, n ∈ N,

p1 = δ3,0 − 3δ2,1 + 3δ1,2 − δ0,3.

Theorem 12. A bisequence (s(m, n))∞

m,n=0 satisﬁes (24), p. 5, if and only if (32)

holds.

Proof. First note that if the representation (24) holds, then to evaluate the left hand
side of (32) we use (6) and (7) which after grouping of the summands results in getting 0.

Now assume that (32) is satisﬁed. We deﬁne a linear mapping

Γ : C[N × N] → C2×2[N],

Let us now get back to the assumption (32). Note that it can be rewritten as
By linearity of s† we have

I(p1) ⊆ ker s†,

where I(p1) denotes the ideal generated by p1. We will show (34) later on that

I(p1) = ker Γ,

theorem together with (33) and (34) implies that there exists a linear mapping

Indeed, the fundamental homomorphism

satisfying

Φ : C2×2[N] → C,

Φ ◦ Γ = s†.

Writing this equality on δm,n we get

s(m, n) = s†(δm,n) = Φ(cid:18) δm+n

which gives the desired representation (32).

Hence, to ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 12 it is enough to show that (34) holds. The
inclusion ⊆ follows by direct computation. To prove (34) it remains to show the converse
ker Γ ⊆ I(p1). Let a ∈ ker Γ which means

a(m, n) δm+n = 0, Xm,n

a(m, n) n δm+n−1 = 0, Xm,n

a(m, n) m δm+n−1 = 0,

a(m, n) mn δm+n−2 = 0,

(35)

with the convention that δ−1 = δ−2 = 0.

We show now that (35) implies a ∈ I(p1). The following decomposition holds

a = Xn∈N

an def=

n

Xi=0

a(i, n − i)δi,n−i, n ∈ N

with the ﬁrst sum to be terminating. Note that each an (n ∈ N) enjoys the properties
(35) as well. Hence, without any loss of generality we may assume that

a =

Xi=0

aiδi,n−i,

for which formulae (35) reduce to

i(n − i) · ai = 0.

Observe, that the second of these equations is a consequence of the ﬁrst and the third and
we may skip it. The remaining equations can be written in the equivalent form

where the matrix Xn is given by

(a0, . . . , an)⊤ ∈ ker Xn,

Xn = 

Note that for n = 0, 1 the matrix Xn has a trivial kernel. For n ≥ 2 the ﬁrst and the last
two columns of Xn are clearly linearly independent and hence

dim ker Xn = (n + 1) − 3 = n − 2, n ≥ 3.

(36)

We will show simultaneously by induction with respect to n ∈ N, n ≥ 3 that

(i) if (a0, . . . , an)⊤ ∈ ker Xn is a solution of the above system of equations then

i=0 aiδi,n−i ∈ I(p1),

Pn

(ii) there exists (a0, . . . , an)⊤ ∈ ker Xn with a0 6= 0,

which will ﬁnish the proof. The kernel of X3 is spanned by (a0, a1, a2, a3)⊤ = (−1, 3, −3, 1)⊤,
hence a = p1 and in consequence (i) and (ii) are satisﬁed. Now suppose that both (i) and
(ii) are true for some n ≥ 3. First observe that if y ∈ ker Xn than (0, y)⊤ ∈ ker Xn+1.
Indeed, subtracting the second row of Xn+1 from the third one obtains the matrix

Consequently, by (36), there are n − 2 linearly independent vectors in ker Xn+1 of the
form (0, a1, a2, . . . , an+1)⊤. Note that for all these vectors one has

a =

n+1

Xi=1

aiδi,n+1−i = δ1,0 ∗

By induction, the element

n

Xi=0

ai+1δi,n−i

is in I(p1), as (a1, . . . , an+1)⊤ ∈ ker Xn. Hence, a ∈ I(p1).
In view of (36) (with n
replaced by n + 1), to ﬁnish the induction step it is enough to show that there exists a
i=0 aiδi,n+1−i ∈ I(p1). By
the induction assumption (ii) there exists (b0, . . . , bn) ∈ ker Xn with b0 6= 0. We deﬁne
i=1 biδi,n−i ∈ I(p1), we

vector (a0, a1, . . . , an+1)⊤ ∈ ker Xn+1 with a0 6= 0 and a = Pn+1
b−1 = bn+1 = 0 and ai = bi−1 − bi, i = 0, . . . , n + 1. Since b = Pn

have

n+1

a =

Xi=0

aiδi,n+1−i = p0 ∗ b ∈ I(p1),

p0 = δ1,0 − δ0,1.

Since a0 = −b0 6= 0, the vector (a0, a1, . . . , an+1)⊤ is linearly independent from vectors of
the form (0, y)⊤ with y ∈ ker Xn, which ﬁnishes the induction step.
