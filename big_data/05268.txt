Acoustic signals generated by ﬁlamentation of ultrashort TW laser pulses in water are character-
ized experimentally. Measurements reveal a strong inﬂuence of input pulse duration on the shape
and intensity of the acoustic wave. Numerical simulations of the laser pulse nonlinear propaga-
tion and the subsequent water hydrodynamics and acoustic wave generation show that the strong
acoustic emission is related to the mechanism of superﬁlamention in water. The elongated shape
of the plasma volume where energy is deposited drives the far-ﬁeld proﬁle of the acoustic signal,
which takes the form of a radially directed pressure wave with a single oscillation and a very broad
spectrum.

INTRODUCTION

When a compressible liquid submitted to external
forces ruptures violently, cavitation occurs and nucleates
bubbles that subsequently implode and undergo oscilla-
tions driven by the external ﬂuid pressure in the sur-
rounding liquid. An acoustic signal is released from the
bubble implosion. Cavitation and acoustic wave gener-
ation can be a phenomenon to avoid or in contrast, a
desired eﬀect provided a certain degree of control can be
reached. For instance, cavitation is well known to in-
duce damage on ship propellers, but cavitation-induced
high-velocity jets and high pressure acoustic wave in wa-
ter allow snapping shrimps to stun or kill prey animals
[1]. Not only in the natural world but also for numer-
ous applications, from chemical engineering, biomedical
ultrasound imaging, to mechanical optical cleaning [2],
internal combustion engine eﬃciency, and interface sci-
ence [3], would it be desirable to control cavitation and
subsequently pressure wave release.

Laser-induced energy deposition in water and eﬀects
following optical breakdown have been investigated for
the past decades (see [4] for recent ﬁndings). Laser in-
duced cavitation in water was discovered in the early six-
ties [5, 6] and has been the subject of continued interest as
it was rapidly recognized that the development of laser-
induced acoustic sources in water could open up new pos-
sibilities for underwater communications, for high reso-
lution imaging, tomography and fast characterization of

marine environment with the aim of exploiting sea re-
sources, or for remote acoustic control of submerged in-
struments [7]. The ﬁrst experiments were performed with
long pulse laser sources, leading to a slow heating of water
followed by thermal expansion and emission of an acous-
tic wave [8–10]. The conversion eﬃciencies from light to
the acoustic signal was however reported to be enhanced
with nanosecond laser pulses, leading to optical break-
down, rapid heating of the focal volume producing pres-
sures in the gigapascal range and explosive expansion fol-
lowed by the emission of a shock wave [11–13]. Femtosec-
ond laser pulses open up new possibilities in this ﬁeld as
they were recently shown to lead to ultrabroad acoustic
signals [14]. The nonlinear propagation of femtosecond
laser pulses in gases or liquids leads to light-plasma ﬁl-
aments, where the laser beam shrinks upon itself due to
the Kerr nonlinearity, to reach intensity levels that ex-
ceed the threshold for optical ﬁeld ionization [15]. This
high intensity can be sustained over extended distances
and the ﬁlament itself can be generated remotely, adding
to the potential ﬂexibility in tuning laser-induced acous-
tic sources. The dynamics of femtosecond ﬁlamentation
in water and its various properties has been investigated
thoroughly in the past decade [16–22], however only a
few investigations focus on the potential of ﬁlaments for
cavitation or acoustic wave generation [13, 23–28].
In
particular Potemkin et al. demonstrated enhancement
of the acoustic signal amplitude with an increase in the
length of the focal region [29].

In this paper, we present investigations on acoustic
signals generated by ultrashort laser pulse ﬁlamentation.
Acoustic measurements were done utilizing femtosecond
and picosecond laser pulses with multi milli Joule energy

as a source of acoustic signals. Numerical simulations are
performed for understanding the nonlinear propagation
of the laser beam through water, the subsequent hydro-
dynamic expansion of the focal volume and the propa-
gation of the generated acoustic signal. The numerical
simulations are divided into three stages discriminated
by the duration of the process: (i) nonlinear propaga-
tion of the beam and laser pulse energy deposition into
water, (ii) laser-induced nonlinear hydrodynamics and
shock-wave formation, (iii) propagation of the acoustic
wave to the hydrophone. Acoustic signals recorded at
distance from the ﬁlament exhibit signatures of the focal
volume shape. Our numerical simulations show that a
nonsymmetrical acoustic signal arising in conditions for
superﬁlamentation can be interpreted as a manifestation
of the shape of the focal volume, which depends on the
laser pulse energy and focusing geometry. Loose focusing
leads to cylindrical focal regions whereas an increase of
the numerical aperture leads to a conically-shaped and
shorter focal volume. Ability to dynamically control the
directivity of the acoustic sources is important for under-
water detection and communications.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND RESULTS

tance d = 31 cm away from the propagation axis of the
laser beam. The spatial-temporal proﬁles of the acoustic
waves were mapped by varying the immersion depth z
of the hydrophone, keeping constant the separation dis-
tance d and the focusing geometry, and by recording for
each depth the acoustic signal reaching the hydrophone
after a laser shot. Figure 2 shows typical measurements.
A spherical acoustic wave emitted from a point source
located at z0 is expected to reach the hydrophone at a

depth z after a delay t = (cid:112)d2 + (z − z0)2/cs, where cs

= 1487 m/s denotes the speed of sound in water under
normal conditions. In other words, the mapped proﬁle
when the focus of the lens is located at z0 should be
a hyperbolic branch, centered at z0, as shown by the
dashed curves in Fig. 2. However, our measurements
show additional features. A conical (V-shaped) proﬁle is
clearly visible as two branches, representing the positive
and negative peaks in the acoustic signal intersecting at
the emission point (top of the most visible hyperbolic
branch at z0 = 270 mm) corresponding to the focus of
the lens, where a maximum in signal amplitude is ob-
served. As will be shown below, several regions of the
focal volume contribute to the acoustic signal:
In ad-
dition to the quasi point source at the focus where the
plasma density reaches ∼ 1022 m−3, multiple ﬁlamenta-
tion occurs in the vicinity of the focus in an extended
focal volume, featured by focusing conditions, and is re-
sponsible for the V-shaped acoustic branches.
In this
particular case there is another source of acoustic wave
located at the surface of water.
In the measurements
discussed below, we moved the focusing lens closer (sep-
aration of h = 13 cm) to the surface of water to prevent
interference of this acoustic wave generated at the sur-
face of water with acoustic waves generated in the bulk.
We analyzed acoustic wave generation by ﬁlamentation

h is the distance between the surface of water and the lens
while z deﬁnes the direction of hydrophone displacement for
spatio-temporal acoustic wave analysis.

The experiment was performed by using a Ti:Sapphire
laser with central wavelength of 800 nm, Fourier limited
pulse duration of 50 fs and pulse energy of 290 mJ. The
beam was focused with a 50 cm lens into a large water
tank (Fig. 1). The lens was placed at a height h above
the surface of water. The initial beam diameter (FWHM)
on the lens was 35 mm. The pulse duration was changed
from 0.25 ps to 5 ps by imposing a linear positive chirp
on the 50 fs pulse. To register the acoustic waves emit-
ted by expansion of the focal volume, a very broad band
needle hydrophone (ﬂat at ± 4 dB on the band 200 kHz
- 15 MHz) was inserted into water at the separation dis-

(plotted as an eye-guide) represents the proﬁle for a spherical

surface and focal region, respectively), and propagating at the

with pulses of diﬀerent initial pulse durations. Figure 3
shows a comparison of acoustic wave proﬁles generated
with pulse durations from 0.25 to 5 ps. The acoustic
waves are plotted with the same colormap for possible
relative amplitude comparability. Our measurements re-
vealed that higher amplitudes of acoustic waves tend to

energy is kept constant. In addition the proﬁles corre-
sponding to the shortest pulse durations (0.25 ps, 0.5 ps)
exhibit a single branch as in the case of a point source
emitting a spherical wave. The amplitude proﬁle of the
acoustic wave obtained with the longer pulse (5 ps), ex-
hibits the additional V-shaped branches with amplitudes
even larger than generated with shorter pulse durations.

waves generated by 290 mJ laser pulses with initial duration
of (a) 0.25 ps, (b) 0.5 ps, and (c) 5 ps. The lens was positioned
at h = 13 cm above the surface of water corresponding to a
focus depth of z0 ∼ 500 mm. Acoustic waves are registered
by moving the hydrophone along a vertical axis at distance d
= 31 cm from the laser propagation axis.

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF LASER

ENERGY DEPOSITION

Three diﬀerent tools were used for numerical simula-
tions of the nonlinear pulse propagation, nonlinear hy-
drodynamics and generation of the acoustic wave, and its
propagation to the hydrophone. Nonlinear propagation
of the laser pulse was simulated by means of the code de-
veloped for investigating superﬁlamentation, beam sym-
metrization in air, and ﬁlamentation of large beams from
orbit [30–32], which resolves a unidirectional envelope
propagation equation describing diﬀraction, the optical
Kerr eﬀect, plasma induced eﬀects including plasma de-
focusing and nonlinear losses due to its generation by
multiphoton and by avalanche ionization (see Appendix
A). Our numerical scheme (see [33] for details) was up-
graded to accommodate beams with high numerical aper-
ture propagating through nonlinear media. A coordinate
transformation proposed by Sziklas and Siegman [34] was
implemented, allowing us to easily treat the fast oscillat-
ing spatial phase. Our model assumes a ﬁxed Gaussian
pulse proﬁle over the whole propagation length. This

3

assumption, associated with a preliminary mapping be-
tween peak intensity and electron density through the
ionization model allows us to perform (2+1)D simula-
tions with the highly demanding resolution required by
our focusing geometry and relatively high pulse energy.
With these new features, the code was used to simulate
ﬁlamentation in water and checked to fairly reproduce ex-
perimental ﬁndings which will be discussed later in the
text. The assumption of a ﬁxed Gaussian pulse shape
slightly overestimates energy losses, however the model
provides a glimpse in the physics behind laser energy de-
position for diﬀerent input beam conditions.

For the numerically simulated experiments, the lens
was located 13 cm above the surface of water. Noise was
added to the input beam so as to mimic irregularities on
the beam proﬁle and start from realistic initial conditions
(as close as possible to experimental conditions). Most
of the numerical simulations results in this section deal
with a comparison of the laser energy deposition in the
focal volume when the duration of the input pulses varies
from 0.5 fs to 5 ps, while the pulse energy of 290 mJ is
kept constant.

Figure 4 represents a comparison of ﬂuence proﬁles ob-
tained from numerical simulations with initial pulse du-
rations of 0.5 ps and 5 ps at the same pulse energy 290
mJ. Converging multiple ﬁlaments are formed in both
cases. The shorter initial pulse initiates ﬁlament for-
mation earlier in propagation because the initial peak
intensity is 10 times larger and ﬁlament generation is
directly linked to intensity via modulational instability,
which has a maximum growth rate proportional to the
intensity. The corresponding plasma density proﬁles are
presented in ﬁgure 5(a,b). The plasma volume is larger
for the shorter pulse, however, a closer inspection reveals
that the plasma is more localized for the 5 ps pulse, and
density reaches slightly higher values. This result foresees
that the heating of water with ps pulses will be more se-
vere. The existence of optimal pulse (of a few ps’s) width
that maximizes deposited energy density appears due to
local optimization of plasma generation processes (multi
photon and avalanche ionization) and beam propagation
properties (focusing conditions, self-focusing, plasma de-
focusing, material dispersion) and is systematically ob-
served in experiments and numerical simulations in di-
electrics (see. e.g., [22, 35, 36]). Figures 4 and 5(a,b)
compare nonlinear propagation of pulses with the same
energy, as in the experiments, resulting in diﬀerences in
the focal volume mainly due to the diﬀerent initial peak
intensity (power). Figure 5(b,c,d) compares plasma den-
sity proﬁles when the initial peak intensity (peak power)
is the same for diﬀerent initial pulse durations 5 ps, 0.5
ps and 0.25 ps, corresponding to pulse energies of 290, 29
and 14.5 mJ, respectively. In this case the dynamics of
multiple ﬁlamentation and the features of the plasma vol-
ume do not diﬀer signiﬁcantly. Filaments are generated
roughly within the same volume, however, the longest
pulse generates plasma at higher density due to a more
signiﬁcant contribution of avalanche ionization.

plasma density plots in ﬁgure 5(a,b) it is evident that
the plasma volume is also larger for the 0.5 ps pulse.
This suggests that the deposited energy density might
be lower for the short pulse. Figure 6a also shows that
by shortening the pulse duration while keeping the peak
power ﬁxed, energy loss is decreasing while the plasma
generation roughly starts at the same position.

losses (b) as a function of propagation distance. The curves

curves correspond to pulses with the same energy while the

In order to have a diagnostic of the local rate of en-
ergy losses, we calculated the derivative of the absorbed

der to investigate numerically the propagation of acoustic
waves from the focal region to the hydrophone, we ana-
lyzed the eﬃciency of laser energy deposition as a func-
tion of pulse duration. Figure 6a shows energy losses for
all cases discussed previously without separating multi-
photon absorption and plasma absorption as both are
contributing to locally heat water. Energy transfer to
matter is the most important quantity for evaluating heat
increase of the matter. The 0.5 ps and 5 ps pulses deposit
89 and 82 % of their initial energy (290 mJ), respectively.
However 0.5 ps pulse starts to lose energy via ionization
of water much earlier than the 5 ps pulse. By comparing

However, closer to the focus, the energy deposition rate
for the 5 ps pulse is the highest. This result already
indicates that long pulses deposit energy closer to the
linear focus, while the short pulses generates multiple

ﬁlaments and looses substantial amount of energy long
before they reach linear focus. To evaluate the average
energy deposited within the focal volume, we evaluate
the deposited energy volume by calculating the second
order moment I2 of deposited energy assuming a super
Gaussian shape:

The radius of the energy deposition volume calculated
from the distribution of deposited energy is depicted in
ﬁgure 7 by green curves. The plasma is not homogeneous
in this region, reﬂecting the hot spots generated by multi-
ple ﬁlamentation. A spectral ﬁltering technique was used
to characterize energy deposition at the meso-scale level,
intermediate between the micro plasma channels and the
entire focal volume. Figure 7b shows the locally aver-
aged plasma density obtained through this procedure.
Similarly to the phenomenon of superﬁlamentation in air
[30], plasma channels tend to merge and become undis-
tinguishable around the focus, with an average plasma
density exceeding that at the entrance of the focal region.
This is in line with recent observations [29] of ﬁlamenta-
tion in water.

The quantitative comparison between the densities of
deposited energy Um(z) for diﬀerent cases is depicted in
ﬁgure 8. It is shown that the density of deposited energy
is much larger for 5 ps pulses than in any other case.
We note that the sound wave can be recorded by the hy-
drophone only when the amplitude overcomes the noise
level set by the dynamic range of the hydrophone. There-
fore we can speculate that the deposited energy density
must reach a threshold value to be able to generate an
acoustic signal above the detection threshold. If for in-
stance the threshold value is 40 J/mm3 - short pulses
(0.5 ps) will generate sound waves only at the nonlin-
ear focus where the red curve overcomes the threshold.
Therefore for short pulses acoustic waves will be regis-
tered coming from a point source, which is similar to the
observations. Long pulses (5 ps) overcome the 40 J/mm3
threshold value for a large range in the focal region and
are expected to generate sound waves above the detection

From the simulated density of laser energy deposition,

simulate the generation of an acoustic wave. To account
for the steep edges of the averaged proﬁle for the energy
deposited in the focal volume, we assumed the latter to
be described by a super-Gaussian proﬁle of order s = 4 in
Eqs (3,4), leading to an amplitude of the initial pressure
proﬁle depicted in ﬁgure 9. Its longitudinal proﬁle follows
that of the deposited energy density depicted in ﬁgure 8
by red curve (5 ps, 290 mJ). We note that the proce-
dure of radially averaging the deposited energy leads to
a maximum elevation of temperature of 6 K above the
background. We also performed calculations for a higher
elevation of temperature of 70 K, corresponding to a peak
pressure of 100 MPa (see rightmost colorbar in Fig. 9),
to check whether nonlinearity signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the
acoustic wave.

criterion for contours is applied to Figs. 10 and 11.

IV. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF
ACOUSTIC WAVE GENERATION AND

PROPAGATION

A. Linear acoustics

In order to interpret the recorded proﬁle of the acoustic
signal, we performed simulations of the propagation of
acoustic waves by using a simpliﬁed model, using the
linearized continuity equation and equation of motion,

together with the equation of state p = c2
sρ. The model
describes linear propagation of acoustic waves. We as-
sumed cylindrical symmetry. As explained above, the
initial condition was taken in the form of a simpliﬁed
pressure proﬁle, shaped as the focal volume where energy
was deposited (see Fig. 9). The underlying assumption
is that the time required for electron recombination and
energy transfer to matter is much shorter than the typical
time for initiating the thermo-elastic expansion of water.

For a comparison with experimental results, the pres-
sure wave amplitude was calculated at a ﬁxed distance
of 28 mm from the source. This distance ensures that
the signal propagated far enough from the source to be
considered as a far-ﬁeld measurement, without a need
of expanding further the radial coordinate axis. Results
shown below in ﬁgure 11 (a) clearly exhibit the same
structure as the experimental results plotted in ﬁgure 3
(a). This indicates that the two acoustic branches mea-
sured in Fig. 3 (a) originate from a geometric eﬀect as-
sociated with the shape of the plasma volume. The ge-
ometry of the source of acoustic waves and their linear
propagation are suﬃcient to explain the main features of
the signal.

B. Nonlinear hydrodynamics and acoustic wave

generation

We have investigated numerically the initial expansion
of the focal volume after laser energy deposition in order
to check if cavitation and shock wave formation signiﬁ-
cantly aﬀect the diagnostics obtained in section IV A by

system of equations above is closed with the additional
expressions for the speciﬁc internal energy, (ρ, T ), and
pressure, p(ρ, T ), given by the Mie Gr¨uneisen equation of
state (see Ref. [37] for details). Here λ=0.58 J /[K m s]
is the heat ﬂux coeﬃcient and T is the temperature. For
waves of small amplitude, Eqns. (6) reduce to the linear
set given by Eqns. 5 (see Appendix B).

Equations (6) are integrated in time, t, by means of
a hyperbolic solver [38]. Figure 10 shows the thermo-
dynamic variables ρ, T , p 10 µs after the pulse transit.
Our simulations are initialized with i) the pressure dis-
tribution p0(r, z) shown in Fig. 9, ii) the equilibrium
density ρ0= 998.2 kg/m3 everywhere, since the medium
barely moves during the pulse transit times (cid:28)ns, iii)
v(t = 0) = 0, consistent with ii), and iv) with e(ρ0, p0)
given by the equation of state.
Figure 10 presents results obtained by assuming initial
peak temperatures ∆T ≡ max{T (r, z, t = 0) − T0} =6
K (left) and 70 K (right) above the room temperature
T0 = 300 K. The initial stages are characterized by a
fast evolution of density and pressure. This is due to the
ultrafast energy deposition from the laser source to the
medium, which occurs at constant density rather than

ally, even a weak localized heating can easily induce cav-
itation and phase changes, reducing compressibility dra-
matically. Thus, simulations carried out with the com-
pressible Euler equations allowed us to check that there
is little diﬀerence in the acoustic wave propagation once
it is detached from the focal region. The two branches in
the far-ﬁeld acoustic signal in Fig. 2 originate essentially
from the shape of the plasma volume where laser energy
is deposited. We also performed a numerical directiv-

at a constant pressure (i.e, in mechanical equilibrium).
Heating of the focal volume occurs while plasma recom-
bines, much faster than the hydrodynamic time-scales
for diﬀusion or ﬂuid motion and therefore the system
is driven out of the equilibrium. Immediately after the
heating of the focal volume, the temperature remains al-
most constant in time due to the very low heat conduc-
tivity (T relaxes over the scale of ms in water). Under
these conditions, the density of water rapidly drops be-
low the background level as pressure decreases to restore
the mechanical equilibrium (ﬂat p) around the laser fo-
cus. This transient process is indeed the responsible for
the emission of an acoustic wave. In the far-ﬁeld, only
the amplitude of the acoustic wave diﬀers but the wave
proﬁle is similar for both heating levels.

Figure 11 shows a comparison of the temporal proﬁle
for the acoustic signals that would be captured by a hy-
drophone placed 5 mm oﬀ axis, for linear and nonlinear
simulations initiated with diﬀerent over-pressures. The
lower is the initial overpressure, the closer the agreement
is expected to be between Eqns. (6) and (5). However,
results are close for heating levels up to 70 K above the
background temperature. We observe that the proﬁles of
the acoustic waves simulated with the compressible Euler
equations (Figs. 11b,c) are very close to that obtained
by linear acoustics (Fig. 11a), and all are in good qual-
itative agreement with the measured proﬁle (Fig. 3c).
These results conﬁrm that the geometry of the source of
acoustic waves and their linear propagation are suﬃcient
to explain the main features of the signal. This cannot
be granted in general: while perturbations of water in
equilibrium are small, the isothermal compressibility is
very high (for example, at 300 K and 1 atm., the isother-
mal compressibility βT ≡ 1/ρ(∂ρ/∂p)T ≈ 10−10P a−1:
an increase of pressure of 1 MPa, ∼ 10 atm, will change
the water density in 1 part amongst 10.000). Addition-

ity study. We recorded pressure vs time on 300 virtual
microphones evenly distributed over the 50 mm radius
half circumference centered at the position of the max-
imum initial pressure (r = 0, z ≈ 490 mm).
In ﬁgure
12 a comparison with experimental results is shown for
the angular dependence of the amplitude for selected fre-
quencies. Most of the sound wave energy is distributed
perpendicularly to the beam propagation axis, as mea-
sured and shown by Y. Brelet et al. [14]. We note that
the directivity is sharply peaked for higher frequencies.
This is associated with the fact that the larger volume
of the conically shaped initial pressure proﬁle generates
lower frequencies and therefore, the directivity is looser,
while the high frequency components are generated at the
elongated but thin peak. A thin initial pressure proﬁle
generates steeper pressure fronts with broader spectrum.
Slight discrepancy for the directivity at low frequencies is
due to the closer position of microphones in the numerical
simulations.

V. CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated a high directivity acoustic
source generated by loosely focused multi milijoule pi-
cosecond pulses in water. The acoustic wave predomi-
nantly propagates transversally to the laser beam and its
origin is attributed to the phenomenon of superﬁlamen-
tation. The dependence of the acoustic signal upon pulse
duration is numerically and experimentally investigated.
While fs pulses tend to produce a point acoustic source
and energy deposition per unit volume remains relatively
low, ps pulses produce an extended source and deposit
much more energy per unit volume, yielding very high
directivity and higher power. The laser induced hydro-
dynamics is fully studied numerically by means of the
compressible Euler equations and a suitable equations of
state for water. Additionally, a simpliﬁed linear acous-
tic model provides eﬃcient calculations of the pressure
far ﬁelds, linking the calculations with the experimental
measurements. The combination of optical and hydro-
dynamical results are in an overall good agreement with
experiments. Our ﬁndings are relevant for underwater
detection and communications, where the ability to dy-
namically control the directivity of the acoustic sources
