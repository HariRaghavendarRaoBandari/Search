The Brans-Dicke action is one of the most natural extensions of the Einstein-Hilbert action. It is
based on the introduction of a fundamental scalar ﬁeld that eﬀectively incorporates a dynamics to
the gravitational coupling G. In spite of the diverse motivations and the rich phenomenology that
comes from its solutions, Solar System tests impose strong constraints on the Brans-Dicke theory,
rendering it indistinguishable from General Relativity.
In the present text, new perspectives for
the Brans-Dicke theory are presented, based on the possibility that the scalar ﬁeld presented in the
BD theory can be external, as well as on the applications to black hole physics and the primordial
universe.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The present status of the General Relativity theory (GR) can be viewed under many diﬀerent perspectives. From
one side, GR is a very beautiful theory of gravitation, both mathematically and conceptually, which passes all local
tests and experiments with ﬂying colours. As an example, the Parametrised Post-Newtonian (PPN) parameters agree
with the predictions of GR theory with a precision of about 10−5 [1]. Due to the fact that the GR predictions are
very small corrections of the usual Newtonian ones, these results may be seen as a strong evidence that GR could be
considered as the correct classical theory of gravitation.

On the other side, however, GR suﬀers from many diﬃculties. First, it is plagued with singularity problems, either
in the beginning of the history of the universe and in the ﬁnal stage of the life of some massive stars. Moreover, in
order to explain the observed dynamics and structure of the universe, the energy-matter sector must be constituted
by 95% of unknown components: dark matter (about 30%), necessary to explain the dynamics of virialized systems
like galaxies and clusters of galaxies, as well as to allow for the structure formation process to take place; dark energy
(about 70%), necessary to explain the present phase of accelerated expansion, as well as the features of the spectrum
of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), and to solve the age of the universe problem. To these issues
we must add the diﬃculties in quantising GR, which constitute a serious limitation of the theory.

Many alternatives to GR have been proposed, and this is very important because the existence of competitive
models may allow to better test the consistency of GR, which is considered as our standard gravitational model.
Recently, there was a revival of such research for a more complete theory of gravitation, through f (R) theories
[2], multidimensional theories [3], theories with scalar ﬁelds with some speciﬁc properties, like the Horndesky [4]
and Galileon theories [5] (just to quote the most popular and promising recent proposals). However, the possible
extensions/modiﬁcations of GR are a very old subject, even older than GR itself! Indeed, we may quote as the ﬁrst
tentative of describing gravity through a single scalar ﬁeld, N¨ordstom’s paper of 1912 [6].

One of the oldest proposal as an alternative to GR as a gravitational theory is the scalar-tensor theory, based on the
non-minimal coupling of a scalar ﬁeld to the gravitational sector. Somehow, it was initially based on the possibility
that the gravitational coupling is not a constant, but may be a function of spacetime. This idea was initially evoked
by Dirac [7], in the thirties, inspired by the coincidence between some representative numbers in physics, like the
ratio between the gravitational and electric force between the electron and the proton in the hydrogen atom, and the
characteristic time of the sub-atomic phenomena and the age of the universe, both giving numbers of about 1040. If
this is not a coincidence, at least one of the fundamental constant of nature (c,  or G) may change with time, since
the age of the universe is, of course, an increasing quantity.

The idea that the gravitational coupling may vary with time has been inserted into a consistent relativistic theory
of gravity in the Brans-Dicke theory, at the beginning of the sixties [8]. There, the varying gravitational coupling is
described through a long range scalar ﬁeld φ non-minimally coupled to the usual Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian, which
is the base of GR. The structure of the theory implies the presence of a new (dimensionless) coupling constant ω such
that when ω → ∞ the GR theory, with a constant gravitational coupling, is recovered. This theory tries also to insert
Mach’s principle in a geometric gravitational theory.

The introduction of a non-minimal coupled scalar ﬁeld, whose inverse is connected with the value of G, leads
to many new possibilities. However, the use of PPN estimations implies, in the absence of a potential term, that
ω > 40.000 [1]. This makes Brans-Dicke theory almost indistinguishable from GR, and for this reason the interest in
that theory has considerably decreased. Remark that this very strict constraint is established by local gravitational
test, whereas cosmology implies less restrictive bounds on ω [9]. However, from the theoretical point of view, the BD

2
theory remained an interesting proposal: when ω = −1, it coincides with the low energy eﬀective action coming from
string theory, in its simplest version; its structure may be mapped into multidimensional theories, which is a current
domain of research.

Is it possible to revive the traditional BD theory by looking at it in a diﬀerent way? If yes, how to reconcile with
the very constraining results coming from local experiments/observations (which give rise the estimations of the PPN
parameters, for example)? This is the subject of the present paper. We will focus on these questions ﬁrst by showing
that the BD theory exhibits some features not yet completely explored, and then presenting an approach which can,
potentially, reconcile the interesting new features of the BD theory with the PPN results. This approach is based on
the possibility that the scalar ﬁeld presented in the BD theory can be external (or, within another terminology, non-
dynamical [10]), meaning that it is not subject to a variational principle, its dynamics being dictated by consistency
conditions of the ﬁeld equations represented by Bianchi’s identities. Finally, we will sketch some properties of the
quantisation of the Brans-Dicke theory in the mini-superspace, which seems to favour negative values of ω.

Professor Spindel has worked intensively on fundamental aspects of physics, in particular gravitational physics, and
we think that such variations on the Brans-Dicke theme is a good way to honour him in the occasion of his 65th
birthday.

II. SCALAR FIELDS

The introduction of scalar ﬁelds is the simplest way to go beyond General Relativity, since it adds a spin 0 degree
of freedom to the theory. We can think of many diﬀerent possibilities of introducing a scalar ﬁeld in a gravitational
context. We will revise very brieﬂy some of them.

The ﬁrst one makes use of the minimal coupling between the scalar ﬁeld and gravitation, and it is deﬁned by the

Lagrangian:

√−g

L =

(cid:26)

R − φ;ρφ;ρ + 2V (φ)

.

(1)

In this Lagrangian, V (φ) is the potential self-interacting term. The corresponding energy-momentum tensor satisﬁes
all the energy conditions if  = 1 (ordinary ﬁeld) but violates the strong and null energy conditions if  = −1 (phantom
ﬁelds).

We may have a much less trivial conﬁguration using the non-minimal coupling:

where f (φ) and ω(φ) are, in general, functions of the scalar ﬁeld itself. The case

deﬁnes the traditional Brans-Dicke theory, which is considered as the prototype of the scalar-tensor theories:

√−g

L =

f (φ)R − ω(φ)

φ;ρφ;ρ

φ

+ 2V (φ)

,

f (φ) = φ, ω(φ) = constant,

V (φ) = 0 ,

√−g

L =

φR − ω

φ;ρφ;ρ

φ

)

+Lm(gµν, Ψ) ,

(cid:27)

where Ψ represents the matter degrees of freedom, which couple minimally to the metric.

Another possibility of including scalar ﬁelds is a non-canonical kinetic term, leading to the K-essence models:

L =

where

and f is a given function of X.

R − ω(φ)f (X) + 2V (φ)

X = φ;ρφ;ρ ,

Other possibilities of constructing a scalar-tensor theory include, for example, the Horndeski [4] theory, which is the
most general scalar-tensor Lagrangian leading to second order diﬀerential equations. Another interesting proposal,
which is related to the Horndeski class of theory, is the Galileon theory [5], where a scalar ﬁeld exhibits some special
translational symmetries. One example of such generalisation is the theory deﬁned by:

√−g

L =

R − Gµνφ;µφ;ν + 2V (φ)

,

In what follows we limit ourselves to the traditional Brans-Dicke theory, represented by the action (4). The

Remark that the usual conservation law for the matter component is preserved in the traditional Brans-Dicke theory.
This is a property related to the preservation of the general diﬀeomorphism invariance in this theory.

III. STATIC, SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC SOLUTIONS

In what follows we will consider the solutions describing a vacuum static spherically symmetric conﬁguration. Such
symmetry can represent a static star or an eternal black hole. For the cases where the rotation of these objects is
small, this symmetry is usually a very good approximation [11, 12]. In order to inspecting better the situation, we
perform a conformal transformation in the action (4):

and write:

With these redeﬁnitions, we end up with the following Lagrangian:

√−g

L =

R − σ;ρσ;ρ

 = ±1 .

gµν = φ−1˜gµν ,

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

Hence, the conformal transformation has allowed us to pass from the Jordan’s frame (for which the scalar ﬁeld couples
non-minimally to the Einstein-Hilbert term) to the Einstein’s frame (for which the scalar ﬁeld is minimally coupled to
the Ricci scalar). In principle, this operation is just a redeﬁnition of the variables of the theory (including the metric).
However, the interpretation of some aspects of the theory becomes easier in the Einstein’s frame. For example, the
scalar ﬁeld has a clear kinetic energy contribution in this frame; the same does not happens in the Jordan’s frame
due to the non-minimal coupling. Remark that the conformal transformation aﬀects also the matter sector and leads
to a non-minimal coupling between the matter degrees of freedom and the scalar ﬁeld.

One important feature is that the parameter  has a positive value if ω > − 3

2 . In the
ﬁrst case, the scalar ﬁeld has the usual expression for the kinetic term, and it is called a ordinary scalar ﬁeld, while
in the second case the sign of the kinetic term is negative and the scalar ﬁeld is usually called a phantom scalar ﬁeld
[13]. In fact, if the kinetic energy appears with the wrong sign, the null energy condition is violated. This property
of the phantom scalar ﬁeld may lead to instabilities, at least at the quantum level. However, interesting new features
appear when we quantise the Brans-Dicke theory, at least in the mini-superspace. In fact, at some simpliﬁed quantum
formulation, in the mini-superspace, the phantom scalar ﬁeld has some nice properties rendering, for example, the
eﬀective Hamiltonian self-adjoint; the same does not necessarily happen for the ordinary scalar ﬁeld [14], as it will be
discussed later.

2 , while it is negative if ω < − 3

A class of static, spherically symmetric solutions for the Brans-Dicke theory in the vacuum is given by [19]:

(cid:26)

4

Black hole solutions exist only when 3 + 2ω < 0, corresponding to the phantom conﬁguration in the Einstein’s frame.
In fact, if 3 + 2ω > 0, a < 1 and the possible horizon at u = 2k is a center. However, in the phantom case, a > 1, and
u = 2k can represent a horizon, even if with very peculiar properties.

At this point it is important to stress that if the scalar ﬁeld has not a phantom nature (in the Einstein’s frame),
no black hole solution can be obtained, but only naked singularity solutions [15–17]. This is true for a minimally
coupled scalar ﬁeld [18] and for the traditional Brans-Dicke theory [19]. However, such restriction can be relaxed in
other conﬁgurations as the string-inspired eﬀective action in the low energy limit [24, 25].

As a matter of fact, we can wonder if the solutions described above are indeed black holes, due to their unusual

properties. Among the latter, we can quote the following:

1. Their surface gravity is zero. It means that their Hawking temperature (if it is possible to deﬁne it, see Ref.

[26]) is zero. For this reason, these black holes has been called Cold black holes.

2. The surface of the event horizon is inﬁnite. This implies an inﬁnite entropy by the area law. But, if the
temperature is zero, the entropy cannot be in principle inﬁnite. Hence, the computation of the entropy in this
case may not follow the classical lines devised for the black holes emerging from GR.

3. The tidal forces are inﬁnite over the event horizon hypersurface. But, point particles can cross the latter.

4. The solutions are asymptotically ﬂat. Hence, static observers at the inﬁnity can be deﬁned.

There is another important feature: the solutions contain a scalar charge, hence these solutions contain hair. This fact
points out the limitations of the so-called no-hair theorem, which seems to be restricted to very speciﬁc situations.

In fact, the general solution for these scalar black holes reveals two types of asymptotically ﬂat black hole, besides
the Schwarzschild one [19]: i) type B1 black holes, where the horizon can be crossed in a ﬁnite proper time by an in
falling particle; ii) type B2 black holes, where the horizon is reached in a inﬁnite proper time for an infalling particle.
In both cases, there is always a throat at a ﬁnite distance of the horizon.

The stability of these structures is more controversial. Some methods of computing the perturbations lead to the

conclusion of stability, but other methods lead to the opposite conclusion [19, 21, 22].

The Brans-Dicke equations admit very simple solutions for an isotropic and homogeneous universe, described, for

example, by the ﬂat Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker metric:

These equations admit quite simple solutions for some speciﬁc equations of state.

1. For a radiative universe, with T ρ

ρ = 0, a simple solution implies ˙φ = 0. This gives the usual radiative solution of
GR theory, with a ∝ t 1
2 . This is quite attractive, since the fact the radiative phase of the standard cosmological
model can be reproduced, implies that a BD cosmological scenario can preserve the results from nucleosynthesis
and those connected with the relic radiation that permeates the universe today.

2. For a matter dominated universe, with p = 0, one obtains the power law solutions:

3. If the universe is dominated by the vacuum energy density, with p = −ρ, implying that ρ = constant by using

the conservation law, there is also a power law solution given by:

a = a0tω+ 1
φ = t2 .

2 ,

(25)
(26)

This solution has been evoked in Ref. [27], leading to a revival of the old inﬂationary scenario [28]. However,
the transition to the radiative phase, together with the necessary number of e-folds to solve the problems of the
standard cosmological model, can be achieved only if ω ∼ 20, in disagreement with the PPN results.

One interesting aspect of the solutions during the matter-dominated phase is that they admit scenarios for which
the universe is accelerating if − 3
3 . However, in this range for the parameter ω we have at least three
problems: i) it disagrees with PPN limits quoted in the Introduction; ii) it is a eternal accelerating regime, and this
implies that the structure formation process would not be possible in such a context; iii) it implies a negative eﬀective
gravitational coupling. Hence, in principle, it seems not possible to implement a realistic scenario.

2 < ω < − 4

We further study the issue of matter-dominated solutions in the BD cosmology in the next section.

V. A GENERAL SPATIALLY FLAT SOLUTION IN THE BRANS-DICKE THEORY

In Ref.

[23], the authors have determined the general solution for a spatially ﬂat, isotropic and homogeneous
universe with a general linear equation of state, which includes the main equations of state of interest to cosmology:
radiative phase, matter-dominated phase, stiﬀ matter and cosmological constant phase.
In what follows, we will
concentrate ourselves on the general ﬂat solutions for the pressure-less matter-dominated era. They read as follows:

In these expressions, t± are integration constant, and we assume that t+ > t−.

On the other hand, when t → ∞, we can neglect t± and the solution takes the form given by(23). There are some
interesting properties concerning these asymptotic behaviours, when − 3
3 . In fact, in this case, initially
the solution represents a decelerating universe, while it becomes an accelerating expansion in the late-times regime:
the decelerating/accelerating transition is achieved naturally. This model has been tested in Ref. [29] using type Ia
supernovae data, with slightly better results than the usual ΛCDM model. However, the price to pay is quite big: in
the given interval − 3
3 the gravitational coupling is negative. The most dangerous aspect, in our point of
view, is that such gravitational repulsive phase may be unstable against small perturbations.
However, the problems pointed out above does not exhaust the richness of such solution. In fact, (23) implies three
possibilities (we exclude for the moment the case ω < − 3
3 , the solution exhibits an accelerated
expansion, but with a negative gravitational coupling; ii) if − 4
3 < ω < −1, the exponent is negative, and it is also an
accelerated universe, but with positive gravitational coupling; iii) if −1 < ω, the solution represents a decelerating
expanding universe.

In the other asymptote, there are much more possibilities. Let us consider the behaviour dictated by the asymptot-
ical expression (31). If the sign plus is chosen in the numerator, the universe is expanding and decelerating. However,
if the sign minus is chosen, three possibilities are obtained: i) if − 3

as displayed in ﬁgure 2. When ω < − 3

Brans-Dicke theory. However, the gravitational coupling can be positive, at least for ω < −2. Hence, at classical level
it is possible that this conﬁguration can be stable.

VI. EXTERNAL FIELD

The results presented in the previous section suﬀers from a major drawback: even if we can obtain very good results
with the Brans-Dicke theory, the PPN analysis based on the local tests lead to a huge value for ω and this implies
that the BD theory is very close to the GR theory. In this section, we discuss a mechanism that may turn the BD
competitive even for small values of ω. This mechanism is based on the concept of external ﬁeld, that is deﬁned in
what follows.

We can deﬁne an external ﬁeld as a ﬁeld not subject to the variational principle. In the process of deriving the
ﬁeld equations from an action, the variation with respect to all the ﬁelds are considered, except for the external
ones. In particular, this procedure is justiﬁed if the expression of the external ﬁeld as a space-time function is known

An external ﬁeld is also called sometimes as a non-dynamical ﬁeld [10]. One of the relevance of the
external ﬁeld approach is the fact that it may be a procedure to include in a given system deﬁned by a Lagrangian
the inﬂuence of external factors. It is somehow connected with the principle of open systems. One simple exemple is
the problem of a trajectory of a charge submitted by a constant electric ﬁeld.

7

We present a speciﬁc example of how implementing the idea of external ﬁelds, based on reference [33]. Let us
consider the Brans-Dicke action, but with the scalar ﬁeld being external. Moreover, we consider a cosmological term
depending on this external scalar ﬁeld.

The conservation of the energy-momentum tensor is still valid because of diﬀeomorphism invariance: the matter
Lagrangian does not depend on the external ﬁeld. There is not, in principle, any speciﬁc equation for the scalar ﬁeld,
since it is an external ﬁeld not subject to the variational principle.
On the other hand, Bianchi’s identities are still valid, leading to

where the primes mean derivative with respect to the scalar ﬁeld φ. The very important diﬀerence with respect to
the usual Brans-Dicke theory is that now, φ = constant is a solution for any ω and even in presence of matter. This
is not possible in the usual Brans-Dicke theory.

We may apply this construction to cosmology. Let us consider the ﬂat FLRW metric:

ds2 = dt2 − a(t)2(dx2 + dy2 + dz2) .

(36)

For simplicity, we ignore the cosmological term Λ and we take ω as a constant. Moreover, let us suppose a pressureless
matter content. The equations of motion are the following:

The GR and BD solutions can not be matched in the traditional context: they are two diﬀerent theories. The
situation changes if φ is now an external ﬁeld. Let us call such theory, EST for External Scalar Theory.
In this
case, the above described GR solution is also a solution for gravitation-external ﬁeld system. Hence, patchwork
solutions, constructed with regions where GR are valid together with other regions where BD solutions are valid,
become possible.

Let us match the solutions in the external ﬁeld approach. We ﬁx t0 = 0, and the transition time t = tm > t+. The

solutions for the matter component read:

Now, it is possible to have a transition from a GR behaviour to a BD behaviour during a single phase of the evolution
of the universe [33]. The success of the GR theory concerning the structure formation can be kept. But, new features
(accelerated expansion?) may be introduced non-trivially. Work is in progress in order to implement explicitly possible
realistic scenarios using this structure.

VII. QUANTUM COSMOLOGY

A simpliﬁed approach to a quantum cosmological model of the Brans-Dicke theory can be made by exploring the
Brans-Dicke action in the mini-superspace. In such approach, the cosmological metric is used, and the only dynamical
variables are the scale factor and the scalar ﬁeld. The metric is written as

ds2 = N 2dt2 − a2(t)(dx2 + dy2 + dz2) ,

(55)

where N is the lapse function which reﬂects the invariance of the theory with respect to time-reparametrisation in
the geometric theories of gravity. The lapse function determines the Hamiltonian constraint.

With these considerations, the gravitational action of the Brans-Dicke theory (4) reads:

(cid:26)

6(cid:2)ϕa ˙a2 + a2 ˙a ˙ϕ(cid:3) − ωa3 ˙ϕ2

(cid:27)

(56)

where we have already discarded the surface terms. The Lagrangian can be written as function of the conjugated
momenta, deﬁned by:

Using this expression, we obtain the following Hamiltonian:

(58)

Remark that eﬀectively the lapse function implies the Hamiltonian constraint. In this equation, πT , πa and πϕ are the
conjugate momenta associated with the matter component, the scale factor a and the ﬁeld ϕ, respectively. We have
introduced the matter component, deﬁned by the equation of state p = αρ, using Schutz’s formalism (for details on
how to compute the expression for the conjugate momentua, see Refs. [34–37]). In fact, using the approach employed
in those references, the matter Hamiltonian becomes:

HM = − N

a3α πT ,

(59)

The quantisation of the equation (58), together with the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, results in a Schr¨odinger-like
equation, from where we obtain a Hamiltonian operator. The canonical quantisation πk → −i∂k, including the
ambiguity due to ordering factors ¯p and ¯q, gives us:

In order to avoid the cross derivative ∂a∂ϕ, let us make a change of coordinates:

a → ϕ− 1

2 b;

ϕ → ϕ .

With those new coordinates and redeﬁning T → T /24, equation (60) becomes:

with new ordering factors, which are related to the previews ones in the following way:

q = ¯q .

The coordinate transformations (61) correspond in fact to a conformal transformation that implies to rewrite the
Brans-Dicke action in the minimal-coupling frame. In order to keep a simple framework, the matter sector will be
that of a radiative ﬂuid, which is conformally invariant.

coming from equation (62) is symmetric (or Hermitian, an equivalent terminology), such that:

(cid:104)φ, Hψ(cid:105) = (cid:104)Hφ, ψ(cid:105) ,

Notice that this measure in the Hilbert space depends on the ordering factors.

Even if the Hamiltonian is symmetric, this fact does not guarantee that it is self-adjoint. To establish the self-
adjoint properties of the Hamiltonian (64), it is necessary to determine the von Neumann deﬁciency indices. This may
depends on the factoring order, but in most of the cases it happens that the Hamiltonian (64) is in fact self-adjoint,
and in the cases where it is not already self-adjoint, it admits self-adjoint extension [14].
One important feature connected with the Hamiltonian (64): its energy spectrum is positive deﬁned only if ω < − 3
2 .
Hence, consistent quantum models seem to be possible only for the phantom regime. In this case, it is possible to
obtain a prediction for the evolution of the universe. In Ref. [38] the expectation value for the scale factor has been
evaluated, displaying a singularity-free universe, with a bounce in the scale factor.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

The Brans-Dicke theory has appeared in the sixties as an important alternative to the GR theory. Later, the
interested in this proposal has decreased considerably due to the restriction imposed by the local tests represented,
for example, by the PPN analysis, which reduced the BD theory essentially to the GR theory. However, the connections
of the BD theory to multidimensional and string theories have kept the BD theory a strongly investigated proposal.
Recently, its connection with the f (R) theories, which is equivalent to the BD theory with a potential, gave a revival
of this prototype of scalar-tensor theory. Again, problems with local tests appeared which could be cope with through
some mechanisms, like the chameleon one.

The frequent mention to the BD theory in the literature shows that it contains yet many unexplored features that
could lead to a solid alternative to the GR theory. We must remember that in spite of its many success, particularly
for small scale gravitational phenomena, the GR theory faces huge problems in explaining large scales phenomena,
besides the diﬃculties of the appearance of singularities in many diﬀerent, but important, contexts.

In the present text, we tried to show the richness of some unexplored feature of the BD theory, like its black hole type
structures when the energy conditions are violated, and the general cosmological solutions, at least in the ﬂat case.
Moreover, we have described a new view of the BD theory based on considering the scalar ﬁeld as an external scalar
ﬁeld. This proposal opens news possibilities to construct a viable cosmological scenario, and new static, spherically
symmetric conﬁgurations. Work is in progress in order to determine speciﬁc viable models.
Some features of quantisation of the Brans-Dicke action in the mini-superspace, with the time variable being
recovered by employing tSchutz’s description for a perfect ﬂuid: the phantom case, represented by ω < − 3
2 seems to
lead to a consistent quantum version, while the ordinary scalar ﬁeld case leads to many anomalies, specially the absence
of positive deﬁned energy; moreover, a non trivial measure must be introduced in order to construct a self-adjoint
operator in both cases.

The richness of this scalar-tensor theory, already more the half century old, seems not have been exhausted yet.
