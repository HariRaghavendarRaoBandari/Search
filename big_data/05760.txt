Abstract

In the paper by means of Fourier transform method and similarity method
we solve the Dirichlet problem for a multidimensional equation wich is a gen-
eralization of the Tricomi, Gellerstedt and Keldysh equations in the half-
space, in which equation have elliptic type, with the boundary condition
on the boundary hyperplane where equation degenerates.The solution is
presented in the form of an integral with a simple kernel which is an ap-
proximation to the identity and self-similar solution of Tricomi-Keldysh type
equation . In particular, this formula contains a Poisson’s formula, which
gives the solution of the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation for the
half-space.
If the given boundary value is a generalized function of slow
growth, the solution of the Dirichlet problem can be written as a convolu-
tion of this function with the kernel (if a convolution exists).

Keywords: Fourier transform, Tricomi equation, Dirichlet problem, approxi-
mation to the identity, self-similar solution, the similarity method, the generalized
functions of slow growth.

Introduction

In the paper is considered the multidimensional elliptic equation in the half-space

ym∆xu + uyy = 0, y > 0, m > −2,

(T)

where x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ Rn, u = u(x, y)
Rn+1,

∆x =

∂2
∂x2
1

+ · · · +

is a function of variabels (x, y) ∈
∂2
∂x2
n

is the Laplace operator on the variable x.

1. If n = 1, m = 1 we obtain the Tricomi equation

yuxx + uyy = 0.

2. If n = 1, m > 0 we obtain the Gellerstedt equation

ymuxx + uyy = 0, m > 0.

3. If n = 1, m < 0 the equation (T) can be written as

uxx + y−muyy = 0, 0 < −m < 2,

it is a special case of the Keldych equation [1].

These equations are used in transonic gas dynamics [2], and in mathematical
models of cold plasma [3].

4. If m = 0 we obtain the Laplace equation

∆u(x, y) = 0.

A bounded (as y → ∞) solution of the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation
for the half-space

∆u(x, y) = 0, x ∈ Rn, y > 0,

u(x, 0) = ψ(x), x ∈ Rn,

is given by the Poisson integral [4], [5]

u(x, y) =

Γ((n + 1)/2)

π(n+1)/2

(|x − t|2 + y2)(n+1)/2 dt.

A similar formula is derived by us in this paper for the solution of the Dirichlet
problem for an Tricomi-Keldysh type equation (T) by means of the Fourier trans-
form to the variables in the boundary hyperplane y = 0 in the case m = 1, and
by the similarity method in the case of m > −2. In this formula, in particular,
is contained the Poisson’s integral formula (m = 0) , which can also be obtained
using the Fourier transform. For the case −2 < m < 0 this formula was earlier

2

obtained by L.S.Parasyuk by Fourier transform [6]. In the case of m > 0 in the
calculation of multidimensional Fourier transformations there are great diﬃculties
(except the case m = 1, wich we consider in section 2). Therefore, we apply the
similarity method. With it, in section 3, we ﬁnd a self-similar solution of the
equation of Tricomi -Keldysh type for any m > −2, which is an approximation to
the identity in the space of integrable functions. Solution of the Dirichlet problem
is represented as a convolution of the self-similar solution of equation of Tricomi-
Keldysh type with boundary function (if thise convolution exists). The general
properties of the approximation to the identity implies that in the case of bouded
piecewise continuous boundary function this convolution is written in the form
of an integral and gives the classical solution of the Dirichlet problem, i.e. the
boundary values of integral coincide with the boundary function at all points of
continuity. In the case of the boundary function, which is a generalized function of
slow growth, the convolution gives a generalized solution of the Dirichlet problem,
i.e. weakly converges in the space of generalized functions of slow growth to a
given boundary generalized function. In particular, the kernel is a solution of the
Dirichlet problem, where the boundary function is the Dirac delta function.

We note that by the similarity method was obtained the fundamental solutions
for the Tricomi operator (m = 1) in the works of J.Barros-Neto and I.M. Gelfand
[7], [8], [9] and by Fourier transform method (m = 1) in the work of J.Barros-Neto
and F.Cardoso [10].

Earlier, using the Fourier transform method we solved in our joint works the
Dirichlet and Dirichlet-Neumann problem for the Laplace and Poisson equations
in a multidimensional inﬁnite layer [11], [12].

1 Notations and statement of the problem

We introduce the following notations:

x = (x1 + · · · + xn) ∈ Rn,
|x| =qx2

1 + · · · + x2

(x, y) = (x1 + · · · + xn, y) ∈ Rn+1, y ∈ R,

n, xt = x1t1 + · · · + xntn, dx = dx1 . . . dxn,

Fourier transform of an integrable function f (x) . If integrable in x function f (x, y)
depends on the variables x and y, then its Fourier transform with respect to x will
be denoted

F (t) = F [f ](t) =ZRn

f (x)eixtdx−

Fx[f ](t, y) =ZRn

f (x, y)eixtdx.

Similarly we deﬁne the inverse Fourier transform of an integrable function F (t)

f (x) = F −1[F ](x) =

and an integrable in t function F (t, y)

Consider the Dirichlet problem for the Tricomi-Keldysh type equation:

ym∆xu + uyy = 0, x ∈ Rn, y > 0, m > −2,

u(x, 0) = ψ(x), x ∈ Rn,

u(x, y) is bounded as y → ∞.

(1.1)

(1.2)

(1.3)

2 Solution the Dirichlet problem for an equation of Tricomi
type in the case m = 1 by means the Fourier transform
method

y∆xu + uyy = 0, x ∈ Rn, y > 0,

u(x, 0) = ψ(x), x ∈ Rn,

u(x, y) is bounded as y → ∞.

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

Applying the Fourier transform with respect to x to the equation (2.1) and denoting

U(t, y) = Fx[u](t, y), Ψ(t) = F [ψ](t).

we get the boundary value problem for ordinary diﬀerential equation with the
parameter t ∈ Rn:

−y|t|2U(t, y) + Uyy(t, y) = 0,

U(t, 0) = Ψ(t), U(t, y) is bounded as y → ∞.

This is Airy equation , its general solution is written in terms of the Airy functions

U(t, y) = c1(t)Ai(|t|2/3y) + c2(t)Bi(|t|2/3y).

4

Because the

lim
y→∞

Bi(|t|2/3y) = ∞ and Ai(0) =

1

32/3Γ(2/3)

,

then, taking into account the boundary conditions, we obtain the solution of the
boundary problem

U(t, y) = 32/3Γ(2/3)Ψ(t)Ai(|t|2/3y).

Applying the inverse Fourier transform, we obtain the solution of the original
Dirichlet problem for the equation of Tricomi type (2.1) - (2.3) in the form of a
convolution (if this convolution exists)

u(x, y) = ψ(x) ∗ kn1(x, y),

(2.4)

where the kernel

kn1(x, y) = 32/3Γ(2/3)F −1

[Ai(|t|2/3y)](x, y).

|t| = ρ, σn−1 - the area of the unit sphere in Rn. To calculate
Let |x| = r,
the inverse Fourier transform we pass to spherical coordinates taking into account
that for positive values of the argument the Airy function is expressed via the
Macdonald function

where Jn/2−1(rρ) – is Bessel function of the 1st kind of order ν = n/2 − 1. This
formula is valid for n = 1, it is easy to check. The last integral is expressed in
terms of the hypergeometric function F ( [14] p. 684, the formula 6.576.3):

The received kernel has the following properties for y > 0:

1) kn1(x, y) > 0,

kn1(x, y)dx = 1,

2) ZRn
3) ∀δ > 0, lim

y→+0

kn1(x, y) = 0.

sup
|x|≥δ

Property 1) is obvious. Property 2) follows from the fact that the Fourier transform
of kn1(x, y) there are 32/3Γ(2/3)Ai(|t|2/3y),

ZRn

kn1(x, y)eixtdx = 32/3Γ(2/3)Ai(|t|2/3y).

Putting t = 0 , we obtain

kn1(x, y)dx = 32/3Γ(2/3)Ai(0) = 1.

ZRn

Property 3) follows from the fact that kn1(x, y) decreases monotonically as a func-
tion of |x| .
These properties mean that kn1(x, y) is the approximation to the identity or δ–
shaped system of functions of x (with parameter y ), for y → +0, kn1(x, y) weakly
converges to δ–function δ(x).
If ψ(x) is a bounded piecewise continuous function then convolution (2.4) exists

and is recorded as an integral

u(x, y) = C ∗

n1ZRn

ψ(x)y

(4y3 + 9|x − t|2)n/2+1/3 dt.

From the fact that the kernel of integral is the approximation to the identity follows
the equality

lim
y→+0

u(x, y) = ψ(x)

6

at the points of continuity of ψ(x), which means that the integral is a classical
solution of the Dirichlet problem. For generalized functions of slow growth ψ(x) ∈
S ′(Rn) , for which a convolution exists, the function

is a generalized solution of the Dirichlet problem:

u(x, y) = ψ(x) ∗ kn1(x, y)

lim
y→+0

u(x, y) = ψ(x) in S ′.

For example, if ψ(x) = δ(x), then the solution of the Dirichlet problem is the
kernel of the integral

u(x, y) = δ(x) ∗ kn1(x, y) = kn1(x, y),

lim
y→+0

kn1(x, y) = δ(x) in S ′.

If ψ(x) ∈ Lp(Rn), 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, then from the properties of the approximation to
the identity [5] follows that

lim
y→+0

u(x, y) = ψ(x)

for almost every x, and if p < ∞ , then u(x, y) converges to ψ(x) in the norm of
Lp(Rn), as y → +0.
For the case n = 1 the integral, which gives the solution of the Dirichlet problem
for the Tricomi equation (2.1) - (2.3), has the form

That is, the kernel kn1(x, y) is the self-similar solution of the Tricomi equation,
which can be found by the similarity method ( [15], [16], Ch. 3). We use this
method to solve the Dirichlet problem for the equation of Tricomi-Keldysh type.

3 Solution the Dirichlet problem for the equation of Tricomi-
Keldysh type in the case m > −2 by the similarity method

We will search the kernel of the integral representation of the solution of the
Dirichlet problem (1.1) - (1.3), which is an approximation to the identity, in the
form of a self-similar solution of the equation of Tricomi-Keldysh type (1.1)

u(x, y) =

1

yα ϕ(cid:18) r

yβ(cid:19) , α > 0, β > 0,

(3.1)

where r = |x|, that is, we are looking for a spherically symmetric solution, depend-
ing only on |x| = r. The equation of Tricomi-Keldysh type (1.1) for a spherically
symmetric function takes the form

ym(cid:18)urr +

n − 1

r

ur(cid:19) + uyy = 0, y > 0, m > −2,

(3.2)

To determine the constants α and β we will do in equation (3.2) the change of
variables

u = C l ¯u, r = C k ¯r, y = C ¯y,

(C > 0),

and require that this equation is transferred into itself. We obtain the equation in
the new variables

C m+l−2k(cid:18)¯u¯r¯r +

n − 1
¯r

¯u¯r(cid:19) + C l−2¯u¯y ¯y = 0.

In order to this equation coincides with the equation (3.2), we set

Hence

m + l − 2k = l − 2.

k =

m + 2

,

l is any.

In the new variables, the self-similar solution should have the same form (3.1)

¯u =

1

¯yα ϕ(cid:18) ¯r
¯yβ(cid:19) .

Returning to the old variables, we obtain

u =

C α+l

yα ϕ(cid:18)C −k+βr
yβ (cid:19) ,

8

in order to coincide this expression with the (3.1), we set

β = k =

m + 2

2

, α = −l, that is, any. We take α = kn = n

m + 2

2

.

From the condition α > 0, β > 0 , it follows that m > −2. And so, we seek a
solution of equation (3.2) in the form

u =

1

ykn ϕ(cid:18) r

yk(cid:19) , k =

, m > −2.

Substituting the function (3.3) in the equation (3.2), we obtain the equation

r

+ 2k2nr + k2r + kr(cid:19) ϕ′(r) + kn(kn + 1)ϕ(r) = 0.

We show that the function knm(x, y), deﬁned by (3.6), is an approximation to
the identity in the space of integrable on Rn functions, that is, has the following
properties for y > 0:

1) knm(x, y) > 0,

knm(x, y)dx = 1,

2) ZRn
3) ∀δ > 0, lim

y→+0

knm(x, y) = 0.

sup
|x|≥δ

Properties 1) and 3) are proved like in section 2 for the case m = 1. Let us prove
property 2). We have

Therefore, the solution to the Dirichlet problem of the equation of Tricomi-Keldysh
type can be written as a convolution of the boundary function ψ(x) with the kernel
knm(x, y) (if a convolution exists)

u(x, y) = ψ(x) ∗ knm(x, y).

If ψ(x) is a bounded piecewise continuous function, the convolution exists and is
recorded as an integral

At points of continuity ψ(x)

11

That is, the integral is the classical solution of the Dirichlet problem.

For generalized functions of slow growth ψ(x) ∈ S ′(Rn) , for which a convolu-

tion exists, the function

is a generalized solution of the Dirichlet problem:

u(x, y) = ψ(x) ∗ knm(x, y)

lim
y→+0

u(x, y) = ψ(x) in S ′.

For example, if ψ(x) = δ(x), then the solution of the Dirichlet problem is the
kernel of the integral

u(x, y) = δ(x) ∗ knm(x, y) = knm(x, y),

lim
y→+0

knm(x, y) = δ(x) in S ′.

If ψ(x) ∈ Lp(Rn), 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, then from the properties of the approximation to
the identity [5] follows that

lim
y→+0

u(x, y) = ψ(x)

for almost every x, and if p < ∞ , then u(x, y) converges to ψ(x) in the norm of
Lp(Rn), as y → +0.
Example. For n = 1, m = −1, we have the Dirichlet problem for the Keldysh
equation

uxx + yuyy = 0, − ∞ < x < ∞, y > 0,

u(x, 0) = ψ(x), − ∞ < x < ∞,
u(x, y) is bounded as y → ∞.

In the paper is considered an elliptic equation in a multidimensional half-space

ym∆x + uyy = 0, x ∈ Rn, y > 0, m > −2,

(T)

which is a generalization of the equations of Tricomi (n = 1, m = 1), Gellerstedt
(n = 1, m > 0), Keldysh (n = 1,−2 < m < 0) and Laplace (n ≥ 1, m = 0). We
are looking for the solution of this equation, which is bounded when y → ∞ and
satisﬁes on the boundary of the half-space Dirichlet boundary condition

u(x, 0) = ψ(x), x ∈ Rn.

Is found an exact solution of the Dirichlet problem in the form of an integral that
generalizes the well-known Poisson formula giving the solution of the Dirichlet
problem for the Laplace equation. The kernel of the integral representation of
the solution of the Dirichlet problem for the case m = 1 is found by the Fourier
transform method, and for the general case of m > −2 by the similarity method
in form a self-similar solution of equation (T). It is shown that this kernel is an
approximation to the identity. The general properties of the approximation to the
identity implies that the integral is a classical solution of the Dirichlet problem if
the boundary function is bounded and piecewise continuous, and if the boundary
function is a generalized function of slow growth, and exists a convolution of the
function with the kernel, the convolution is a generalized solution of the Dirichlet
problem . That is, a solution for y → +0 tends to the boundary function in
S ′(Rn) in the sense of theory of generalized functions .
