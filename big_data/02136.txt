Abstract

Using diﬀerent types of embeddings of equations of motion we investigate the
existence of generalizations of the “New Massive Gravity” (NMG) model with the
same particle content (massive gravitons). By using the Weyl symmetry as a guiding
principle for the embeddings we show that the Noether gauge embedding approach
leads us to a sixth order model in derivatives with either a massive or a massless
ghost. If the Weyl symmetry is implemented by means of a Stueckelberg ﬁeld we
obtain a new scalar-tensor model for massive gravitons. It is ghost free and Weyl
invariant at linearized level. The model can be nonlinearly completed into a scalar
ﬁeld coupled to the NMG theory. The elimination of the scalar ﬁeld leads to a
nonlocal modiﬁcation of the NMG.

We also prove to all orders in derivatives that there is no local, ghost free em-
bedding of the linearized NMG equations of motion around Minkowski space when
written in terms of one symmetric tensor. Regarding that point, NMG diﬀers from
the Fierz-Pauli theory, since in later case we can replace the Einstein-Hilbert action
by speciﬁc f (R, (cid:3) R) generalizations and still keep the theory ghost free at linearized
level.

Introduction

Massive spin-2 particles can be covariantly described by means of a symmetric rank-2
tensor. Although this not the only possible tensor structure, it is very convenient. It is
closely connected with a geometrical point of view (ﬂuctuation about some metric) and
it is a minimal description in the sense that we need just one auxiliary ﬁeld, i.e., the
trace of the tensor which vanishes on shell. If we further require a second-order theory, in
derivatives, we end up with a unique answer: the Fierz-Pauli (FP) theory [1]. Almost all
developments in massive gravity, from earlier works [2, 3, 4, 5] until recent developments,
see [6, 7] for review articles, are built up on the top of the FP theory. It is remarkable
that absence of ghosts [4] and of mass discontinuity [2, 3] have been both achieved in
recent theories with one [8, 9] and two [10] dynamic metrics. A good question concerns
the uniqueness of those massive theories, see for instance [11, 12, 13, 14]. One might
speculate on the consequences of abandoning the FP paradigm and allowing for higher
derivative kinetic terms. In fact, the reader can ﬁnd higher derivative massive gravities
in [15, 16, 17, 18, 19].

At linearized level, those higher derivative models are speciﬁc generalizations of the FP
theory which however share the same spectrum (massive spin-2 particles) without ghosts.
This demands of course a more general investigation of all possible higher derivative
generalizations of the FP model.

One way of producing higher derivative models dual to some “lower derivative” theory
is by means of the embedding of its Euler tensor (equations of motion). In particular,
this approach can be used to derive the “New Massive Gravity” (NMG) of [20] from
the FP theory as explained in [21]. This dualization procedure can also be used [21] to
derive the linearized topologically massive gravity (3rd-order in derivatives) of [22] from
the ﬁrst-order spin-2 self-dual model of [23].

In [24] we have investigated, to all orders in derivatives, all possible embeddings of
the equations of motion of the FP theory which are ghost free at linearized level. The
method consists of adding to the FP theory quadratic terms in its equations of motion
and ﬁx the coeﬃcients of those terms as function of (cid:3) = ∂µ∂µ such that at the end we
have a dual model with the same particle content of the FP theory. We have found a
system of equations allowing for several solutions for the coeﬃcients. Those theories are in
general of higher order in derivatives but still ghost free at the linearized approximation.
They correspond to modiﬁcations of the FP theory in the spin-0 sector of the propagator.
They can all be nonlinearly completed with the help of a ﬁducial metric. Most of them
are f (R, (cid:3)R) modiﬁcations of the Einstein-Hilbert kinetic term plus the FP mass term.
Although a complete analysis has not yet been carried out, at least a subset of such theories
can be modiﬁed with an appropriate non derivative potential of the type suggested in [8, 9]
and become apparently ghost free beyond the linearized approximation, as shown in [17].
On the other hand, to the best we know, there is only one alternative to the FP theory
where the spin-2 sector of the propagator is modiﬁed1 namely, the D = 3 NMG theory
of [20]. Here we investigate the application of embedding procedures on the curvature
square NMG theory in order to produce even higher order models.

The embeddings we have done in [21] are all based on requiring some local symmetry,
Noether gauge embedding (NGE), for the dual model while the embedding used in [24]
requires equivalence of the equations of motion. In section II we ﬁrst carry out the NGE

1In the FP model there is only one massive pole in the spin-2 sector while in the NMG model there
is both a massive and a massless pole, see (38), however the massless pole does not correspond to a
propagating particle [25].

embedding of the NMG model with respect to the Weyl symmetry. Next, we introduce
a scalar Stueckelberg ﬁeld and obtain a new scalar-tensor theory for massive gravitons in
D = 2 + 1. In section III we look at rather general embeddings where quadratic terms
in the NMG equations of motion are added to the NMG theory with coeﬃcients which
are arbitrary functions of (cid:3). We examine the propagator of the ﬁnal higher-order model
and require equivalence of the particle content, i.e., the new dual theory must describe
massive spin-2 particles and nothing else. Diﬀerently from the FP case we show here
(section III) to all orders in derivatives that there is no local ghost free embedding of the
NMG equations of motion. In particular, the NGE embedding of the Weyl symmetry of
section II also leads to a ghost. The Stueckelberg approach leads to a ghost free model
which after elimination of the scalar ﬁeld becomes nonlocal. The work in section III is
based on the analytic structure of the propagator. In section IV we present some ﬁnal
comments and our conclusions.

2 Weyl embedments of the “New Massive Gravity”

By a systematic Lagrangian procedure, called Noether gauge embedment (NGE), one
can deduce a gauge invariant massive theory out of a non gauge invariant one [26]. The
gauge symmetry of part of the initial Lagrangian is extended to the whole ﬁnal theory.
However, there is no guarantee that the particle spectrum is preserved. In [21] we have
shown that the linearized NMG theory can be obtained via NGE from the usual Fierz-
Pauli theory via embedding of linearized reparametrizations. We have also shown that
a linearized higher derivative topologically massive gravity is obtained from the usual
linearized topologically massive gravity of [22] via NGE of the Weyl symmetry.
In all
those cases the particle content is preserved. One could wonder what would be the gauge
invariant action obtained from the linearized New Massive Gravity theory. Since part of
the action of NMG, the curvature square term, is invariant under Weyl transformation
δW hµν = φηµν, one might try to embed this symmetry into a new theory. This is what
we next do. The linearized NMG theory can be written, up to an overall constant, as

SN M G = 2 Z d3x√−g(cid:20)−R +
= Z d3x (cid:20)hµνGµν(h) +

R2(cid:19)(cid:21)hh

where Gµν(h) is the usual linearized self-adjoint Einstein tensor and Sµν(h) is the lin-
earized Schouten tensor in D = 3 deﬁned as [Rµν(h) − ηµνR(h)/4]hh which has the useful
property of “commutativity” with the Einstein tensor in the sense that inside integrals
Gµν(h)Sµν(f ) = Gµν(f )Sµν(h).
In the NGE procedure an important ingredient is the
Euler tensor :

With the help of an auxiliary ﬁeld aµν such that δW aµν = −δW hµν we implement a ﬁrst
iteration of the form:

The Weyl variation of (3) can be written as

S(1) = SN M G +Z d3x aµνK µν.

Therefore we end up with the Weyl invariant theory

δW S(1) = −Z d3x δW [aµνGµν(a)].

(3)

(4)

(5)

SW = SN M G +Z d3x (aµνK µν + aµνGµν(a))

Noticing that the Euler tensor (2) can be written in terms of the Einstein tensor i.e.:
K µν = 2Gµν(H) with H µν ≡ hµν + 2 Sµν(h)/m2 we can rewrite SW as

SW = SN M G +Z d3x (2 aµνGµν(H) + aµνGµν(a))

= SN M G +Z d3x (−HµνGµν(H) + (a + H)µνGµν(a + H))

.

(6)

After the shift aµν → ˜aµν − Hµν in (6), the ˜aµν auxiliary ﬁeld decouples. We can safely
discard the last term ˜aµνGµν(˜a) which is a linearized Einstein-Hilbert term without par-
ticle content. Thus we have a 6th order Weyl invariant action which turns out to have a
nonlinear completion,

SW = Z d3x (hµνGµν(h) +

(7)

Since the tensor structure of (7) is the same of the curvature square term of the NMG
theory, it is clear that SW is invariant under Weyl transformations. The particle content
of SW will be examined in the next section. The theory SW contains a ghost.

Another way to embed the Weyl symmetry in the “New Massive Gravity” is to intro-
duce a scalar Stueckelberg ﬁeld in (1) by substituting hµν → hµν + ηµν φ. Since the fourth
order term of SN M G is Weyl invariant we end up with

namely,

It is clear that the equations of motion δ SN L
φ = 0 contain the trivial solution gµν =
ηµν , φ = 0. Expanding about such vacuum up until quadratic terms in the ﬂuctuations
we recover SL
consists, at tree level, of one massive
spin-2 particle just like the NMG of [20]. However, as in the K-model (massless limit of
NMG) studied in detail in [27] and [28], we might have problems at nonlinear level since
the linearized Weyl symmetry is probably broken at nonlinear level and consequently the
scalar ﬁeld stops being pure gauge in the full model (51). In particular, the phenomenon
of bifurcation of constraints found in [28] might also be present here. A detailed study of
the constraints structure should be carried out.

3 Generalized Euler tensor embedment of “New Mas-

sive Gravity”

Our starting point is the linearized NMG theory with the addition of quadratic terms in
its equations of motion:

LG[hµν] =

1

hµνK µν +

1
2

Kµν d((cid:3)) K µν +

1
2

K f ((cid:3)) K

(10)

The ﬁrst term in (10) is the linearized NMG theory. The NMG Euler tensor K µν is given
in (2). The coeﬃcients d((cid:3)) and f ((cid:3)) are so far arbitrary functions of (cid:3) = ∂µ∂µ such
that the Lagrangian LG remains local. Due to the conservation law ∂µKµν = 0 which
holds identically due to the linearized reparametrization invariance of the NMG (δhµν =
∂µξν + ∂νξµ), other terms which might show up in (10) like (∂µK µν)2 and ∂µK µν∂νK do
not contribute2. In terms of the original ﬁeld hµν we can rewrite LG as

LG = ∂µhµν c1((cid:3)) ∂αhαν+∂µh c2((cid:3)) ∂νhνµ+h c3((cid:3)) h+hµνc4((cid:3)) hµν+∂µ∂νhµνc5((cid:3))∂α∂βhαβ.
The coeﬃcients ci((cid:3)) are given by3

2We have constrained us here to parity invariant theories, thus avoiding terms like ǫµναKµγ∂ν K γ

3Henceforth, unless otherwise stated, we replace d((cid:3)), f ((cid:3))) by d, f respectively, though they are still

arbitrary functions of (cid:3).

The Lagrangian LG can be further rewritten in terms of a four indices diﬀerential
operator LG = hµνGµναβhαβ whose inverse G−1 does not exist due to the linearized
reparametrization symmetry. We choose the de Donder gauge ﬁxing term:

(17)
which amounts to shift c1 → c1 + λ , c2 → c2 − λ in formulas (12) and (13) but not in (14)
and (15). In (14) we make c3 → c3 − λ(cid:3)/4. Before we display G−1 we take a closer look
at the coeﬃcients ci((cid:3)) in (12)-(16). A local Lagrangian density in terms of hµν demands

LGF = λ (∂µhµν − ∂νh/2)2

where ˜d((cid:3)) and ˜f ((cid:3)) are analytic functions of (cid:3) while a is an arbitrary real constant.
In terms of the spin-s projection operators P (s)

the four indices we have

(20)

a = 1 and

˜d((cid:3)) = −2 ˜f ((cid:3))

,

(21)

since we have a zero in the denominator of the spin-0 sector which indicates a spin-0
symmetry. Indeed, under a Weyl transformation δW hµν = Λ ηµν we have from (10) after
integrations by parts

δWLG = h(2 c4 + 6 c3 − (cid:3) c2)Λ + ∂µ∂νhµν[2 (cid:3) c5 − 2 c1 − 3 c2]Λ

= ((cid:3) h − ∂µ∂νhµν)[1 − a + (cid:3) ( ˜d + 2 ˜f )]Λ .

(22)

In the special case (21) we need to add another (Weyl) gauge ﬁxing term, we may choose
GF = ξ h2. This implies the shift c3 → c3 + ξ. Consequently, in the Weyl symmetric
LW
case we have

Next we analyze the particle content of LG from the analytic structure of G−1 and
G−1
W . In momentum space we can calculate the gauge invariant two point amplitude A(k)
by saturating G−1 or G−1

W with external sources. For instance,

A(k) = −

.

(24)

Where G−1(k) = G−1(∂µ → i kµ). Due to the linearized reparametrization symmetry, the
source must be transverse kµTµν = 0, consequently,

A(k) = i(cid:20)

S(2) = T ∗

µνT µν − |T|2

,

The quantity T = ηµνT µν = −T00 + Tii is the trace of the external source in momentum
space. If the two conditions for Weyl invariance (21) hold we must have T = 0.
A key role is played by the imaginary part of the residue of A(k) at each pole. For

instance, at k2 = −m2 we have:

Im ≡ ℑ lim

k2→−m2

(k2 + m2)A(k)

.

(28)

If and only if Im > 0 we have a physical particle. If Im = 0 we have a non propagating
mode while Im < 0 or no deﬁnite sign for Im signalizes the presence of ghost. In order to
verify the sign of Im we ﬁx a convenient coordinate frame splitting the cases of massless
and massive poles. In the massless case we ﬁx a frame such that kµ = (k0, ǫ, k0), thus,
kµkµ = ǫ2. We will take ǫ → 0 at the end. This caution is necessary for the analysis of
double poles. From the three conditions kµTµν = 0 we have in this frame

T01 = −T12 −

Since d(k2) and f (k2) are arbitrary analytic functions, there might be double poles
in the denominator of A(k). We ﬁrst examine those poles. From (26),(27),(35) and (36)
we see that is impossible to take linear combinations of S(0) and S(2) in order to end up
only with terms of order ǫ2. Therefore a massive double pole 1/(k2 + m2)2 = 1/ǫ4 can not
be reduced to a simple pole by any ﬁne tuning of the functions d and f . So henceforth
we assume that all massive poles must be simple poles. The conclusion remains the
same for the Weyl symmetric case.
In the later case T00 = T11 + T22 and (34) imply
T22 = −T11 + (ǫ2/m2)T11 which does not help canceling the term |T12|2 in (35).
The massless case is a bit diﬀerent. From (26),(27),(32) and (33) we see that we do
have one special combination of order ǫ2 which may turn double poles into simple ones,
namely,

ǫ2
k2

22 + T ∗

0 (cid:2)(T11T ∗

11T22) − 2 |T12|2(cid:3)

µνT µν − |T|2 =
22 + T ∗

S(2) − S(0) = T ∗
However, the term (T11T ∗
11T22) has no deﬁnite sign. So we end up with a ghost.
In the special case of Weyl symmetry, using (31) in T00 = T11 + T22 we have T11 =
2(ǫ/k0)T12 + O(ǫ2). Thus, the dangerous term of (37) becomes of order ǫ3 and will not
contribute to the residue. So we may hope to turn a double massless pole 1/k4 into
a a physical pole only in the Weyl invariant case after a speciﬁc ﬁne tuning of d and
f . In particular, this is the mechanism behind the fourth order K-term which describes
a physical massless particle as explained in [27] via decomposition of hµν in orthogonal
modes and in [29] via analytic structure of the propagator.

(37)

.

In summary, multiple poles lead us to ghosts in general except for the double massless

pole in the Weyl symmetric case which will be examined later on.

Henceforth we split our analysis in four cases:

a 6= 1 (Case I)
a = 1 and d + 2 f 6= 0 (Case II)
a = 1 and d + 2 f = 0 (Case III )
a = 0 = d and f = 1/(2 k2) (Case IV)
In the cases III and IV we have Weyl symmetry. The case IV corresponds to the Sφ model
of (8) after elimination of φ.

3.1 Case I : a 6= 1

As a warm up we start reproducing the results of [25] for the NMG theory. We take
a = 0 = d = f . We have one massless and one massive pole,

(38)

Taking ǫ → 0 in (32) and (33) we have a vanishing residue at the massless pole and
consequently a non propagating mode:

The residue at the massless pole vanishes for the very same reason as it does in the
Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory of [22], namely, the lowest order term (in derivatives) of
the theory (linearized Einstein-Hilbert) has no particle content. Taking ǫ → 0 in (35) and
(36) we have a positive residue at the massive pole, a physical massive spin-2 particle,

Im = ℑ lim

k2→−m2

(k2 + m2) A(k) = S(2) = 2 |T12|2 + |T11 − T22|2

> 0 .

(40)

Now we go back to the general case a 6= 1. Except for the NMG case a = 0 = d = f
which will not be treated here anymore, we have in general extra massive poles stemming
from the polynomial Q(k2). Requiring that no tachyons show up we can write

A(k) =

−i m2 SA(k2) QNQ
(a − 1)k2(k2 + m2)(k2 + m2

i=1 m2
1) · · · (k2 + m2

i

NQ

,

)

(41)

where NQ ≥ 1 is the number of extra massive poles coming from Q(k2). Since we are
specially interested in the massive poles, we can write from (26),(27) and (35), (36) at
ǫ → 0,

SA(k2) ≡ S(2) + A(k2) S(0) = 2|T12|2 + |T11|2 + |T22|2 +

(A − 1)

2

|T11 + T22|2

.

(42)

The quantity A(k2) is an analytic real function of k2 whose speciﬁc form is not important,
it is deﬁned by comparing (41) with (25). Deﬁning the polynomial of degree NQ + 1:

,

NQ)

P(k2) = (k2 + m2

(43)
0 ≡ m2 is the mass squared already present in the NMG theory, it is clear that
where m2
the sign of the residue Imj at some pole k2 = −m2
j depends essentially upon the sign of
j , where P ′ = dP/dk2. Since the derivative of a
the ratio SA/P ′ calculated at k2 = −m2
polynomial has alternating signs at its consecutive simple zeros, the only hope of having
positive residues at the diﬀerent massive poles is to require that SA also has alternating
signs at such points. However, it is easy to prove that SA(−m2
j ) either has no deﬁnite sign
or is deﬁnite positive. The point is that, if A(−m2
j ) ≥ 0 we can guarantee that the last
three terms of (42) add up to a non negative number, so in those cases SA(−m2
j ) ≥ 0. On
the other hand, since the three complex numbers T12, T11, T22 are totally unconstrained,
even if we take A(−m2
j ) < 0, depending on the relative strength of those three complex
numbers, the sign of (42) may change. Thus, we can not guarantee that SA(−m2
j ) < 0.
In conclusion, whenever we have more than one massive pole we have ghosts and only the
NMG case is safe at a 6= 1.

3.2 Case II : a = 1 and d + 2 f 6= 0

In this case we have in principle a double massless pole and massive poles:

A(k) = −i(cid:26)

m4S(2)

k4(k2 + m2)[(k2 + m2)d − 1]

+

S(0)

k4(d + 2 f )(cid:27) .

(44)

We can choose d(0) + f (0) = 1
2 m2 and turn the double massless pole into a simple one.
However, since we have no Weyl symmetry, as explained in the paragraph of formula (37),
we are doomed to have a massless ghost. Therefore we go to the next case.

3.3 Case III : a = 1 and d + 2 f = 0
If we set a = 1 and ˜d = −2 ˜f , or d = −2 f , in formulas (12)-(16) and plug those results
in (11) we have

LW =

,

(45)

where H((cid:3)) = ((cid:3) − m2)[1 − 2 ((cid:3) − m2) ˜f ((cid:3))]. The above Lagrangian can be nonlinearly
completed in terms of square of curvatures in the form of a K-term of the NMG theory,
i.e.,

LN L
W =

gµν R(cid:19) ((cid:3) − m2)[1 − 2 ((cid:3) − m2) ˜f ((cid:3))]Rµν

,

(46)

In the case ˜f = 0 we recover the Weyl embedding of the last section, see (7).

Back to the two-point amplitude A(k), we have again a double massless pole and
massive poles in general. Assuming that the analytic function f (k2) = ˜f ((cid:3) → −k2) is
such that we have no tachyons, we can write

A(k) = i

m4S(2)

k4(k2 + m2)[1 + 2 f (k2 + m2)]

= i

i=0 m2

i

m2S(2)QNQ
k4P(k2)

.

(47)

where P(k2) is deﬁned in (43). From (27), (35) and the fact that T = 0 due to the Weyl
symmetry, we have at each massive pole :

Imj = ℑ lim

k2→−m2
j

(k2 + m2

j )A(k) =

2(|T12|2 + |T11|2)

P ′(−m2
j )

.

(48)

Due to the alternating signs of P ′ at its consecutive single zeros, it is impossible to
have Imj > 0 for all j = 0,· · · , NQ. We are forced to assume NQ = 0, i.e., f = 0.
In this subcase P(k2) = k2 + m2, so P ′ = 1 and the massive pole is a physical one
Im = Im0 = 2(|T12|2 + |T11|2) > 0. Regarding the massless double pole, we have already
seen that due to the Weyl symmetry we have T11 = 2(ǫ/k0)T12 + O(ǫ2), substituting back
in (32) we obtain [29]

T µνT ∗

µν = −2

ǫ2
0 |T12|2 + O(ǫ3)

(49)

Consequently, although the apparent double pole has become a simple pole we still have
a ghost due to the negative sign of the residue:

I0 = ℑ lim

k2→0

k2A(k) = lim

ǫ→0

m2
ǫ2 T µνT ∗

µν = −

2 m2

,

(50)

Therefore, the Weyl invariant theory (7) of last section will unavoidably contain a ghost.

3.4 Case IV : a = 0 = d and f = 1/(2 k2)

In this last case we have a nonlocal theory corresponding to the Weyl invariant action Sφ
given in (8) after the elimination of φ:

After saturating the propagator with transverse and traceless sources as in (24) we are
left with two simple poles, one massive and one massless which come both from the pure
spin-2 sector:

A(k) = −i

m2 S(2)

k2(k2 + m2)

.

(55)

As expected, the dependance on the gauge parameters λ and ζ disappear which guarantees
gauge invariance of the two-point amplitude. When we look closer at the massless pole
using kµ = (k0, ǫ, k0), it is easy to see that its residue vanishes with power ǫ2. From (32),
(33) and T = ηµνT µν = 0 we have

I0 = ℑ lim

k2→0

k2 A(k) = − lim

ǫ→0

ǫ2
k2

0 (cid:2)−2|T12|2 + (T11T ∗

The massive pole is a physical one (positive residue). From (35) we have

Im = ℑ lim

k2→−m2

(k2 + m2) A(k) = S(2) = |T22|2 + 2|T12|2 > 0

(57)

Therefore, the linearized version of the model (51) is unitary and contains only massive
gravitons in the spectrum.

4 Conclusion

There are several higher-order, in derivatives, modiﬁcations of the Fierz-Pauli theory
which describe massive spin-2 particles and are still ghost free at linear level. At nonlinear
level they can be identiﬁed with f (R, (cid:3) R) modiﬁcations of the Einstein-Hilbert theory
plus the Fierz-Pauli (FP) mass term, see [24]. All such modiﬁcations of the FP model
occur in the spin-0 sector of the theory. Some of those models have been further changed,
see e.g.
[19], by the addition of a convenient non derivative nonlinear potential of the
type found in [8, 9] in order to account for the absence of ghosts at nonlinear level. They
deﬁne massive gravity theories with interesting cosmological properties.

Another alternative massive spin-2 theory is the so called “New Massive Gravity”
(NMG) [20] which exists only in D = 3. Its propagator diﬀers from the FP case also in
the spin-2 sector. In section III we have generalized the embedding procedure used in [24]
in order to search for arbitrary higher-order modiﬁcations of the NMG model. Contrary
to the FP case, we conclude that there is no local ghost-free modiﬁcation of the NMG
theory. We have carried out a thorough calculation of the residues at all possible massive
and massless poles in the propagator. There is always a pole with negative residue (ghost).
In section II we have used the Weyl symmetry as a guiding principle for the embed-
ding of the NMG. First we have looked at the Noether gauge embedment of the Weyl
symmetry, which leads to (7). In this case we only have one massive and one massless
pole. Unfortunately, their residues have opposite signs. If we reverse the overall sign of
(7), we have a physical massless graviton and a massive ghost. So we might hopefully
use the Weyl invariant model (7) with reversed sign as a phenomenological toy model
along the lines of [30]. Namely, we can have a consistent unitary theory if the ghost mass
stays above the energy cut-oﬀ of the theory. Although the model (7) is of sixth-order in
derivatives, the double massless pole is reduced to a simple pole and the analytic structure
of the propagator is similar to some curvature square modiﬁcations of general relativity
in D = 4.

Still in section II we have obtained a promising candidate for a consistent massive
gravity diﬀerent from the NMG model. From the introduction of a scalar Stueckelberg
ﬁeld in the linearized version of the NMG theory we have derived the linearized Weyl
invariant model given in (8). As in the case of (7) we have one massless and one massive
pole but diﬀerently from (7) both poles are simple poles. The Weyl symmetry now
kills the residue at the massless pole such that the “would be” massless ghost does not
propagate at all as shown at the end of section III (Case IV). The residue at the massive
pole is positive and we are left with physical massive gravitons, at least in the linearized
approximation. The model can be nonlinearly completed leading to the scalar-tensor
theory (51) which might be an alternative to the usual NMG model. However, as in the
case of the pure K-term (massless limit of NMG) analyzed in [28], the Weyl symmetry
is probably broken beyond the linearized level which might lead to a ghost in the full
theory. This is probably true also for the higher derivative topologically massive gravity
of [21, 31]. Those examples demand detailed investigations of the constraints structure
which are beyond the scope of the present work.
