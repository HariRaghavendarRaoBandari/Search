L-SPACE FILLINGS AND GENERALIZED SOLID TORI

THOMAS GILLESPIE

Abstract. Much work has been done recently towards trying to understand the topo-
logical signiﬁcance of being an L-space. Building on work of Rasmussen and Ras-
mussen, we give a topological characterisation of Floer simple manifolds such that all
non-longitudinal ﬁllings are L-spaces. We use this to partially classify L-space twisted
torus knots in S1 × S2 and resolve a question asked by Rasmussen and Rasmussen.

If M is a rational homology S3, we can deﬁne the Heegaard Floer homology (cid:100)HF (M ),
which satisﬁes rk((cid:100)HF (M )) ≥ |H1(M )|. It is natural to try and understand the manifolds
with the simplest Heegaard Floer homology, those with rk((cid:100)HF (M )) = |H1(M )|, which we

1. Introduction

call L-spaces. A conjecture of Boyer, Gordon and Watson [1] suggests a concise description
of such manifolds in terms of π1(M ).

Conjecture 1.1 ([1]). An irreducible rational homology 3-sphere is an L-space if and only
if its fundamental group is not left-orderable.

A lot of recent work in the subject has gone into studying this conjecture. We follow
a path taken by Rasmussen and Rasmussen in [6] who approach the problem from the
perspective of Dehn ﬁlling. More precisely, if Y is a rational homology S1 × D2, we will be
interested in classifying the L-space ﬁllings of Y , i.e. the set

L(Y ) = {α ∈ Sl(Y )| Y (α) is an L-space}

In particular, we will study the case
where Sl(Y ) is the set of ﬁlling slopes on ∂Y .
L(Y ) = Sl(Y ) − {l}, where l is the homological longitude.
In [6], Rasmussen and Rasmussen deﬁne a subset Dτ
>0(Y ) ⊂ H1(Y ) that (almost) com-
pletely determines the set L(Y ). We strengthen a result of theirs about the behaviour of
manifolds with L(Y ) = Sl(Y ) − {l}.
Theorem 1.2. The following are equivalent

(1) L(Y ) = Sl(Y ) − {l}.
(2) Y has genus 0 and has an L-space ﬁlling.
To prove this theorem, we show that for any Y , Dτ

>0(Y ) = ∅ if and only if Y is a generalized
solid torus. This is closely related to the notion of a solid torus-like manifold, introduced
by Hanselman and Watson in [4], which is a condition on the bordered Floer homology of
the manifold. In particular, all solid torus-like manifolds are generalized solid tori, and if
H1(Y ) is torsion-free the notions are equivalent.

This also allows us to simplify a result of Hanselman, Rasmussen, Rasmussen and Watson
([3, Theorem 7]) concerning splicing of manifolds. Given two manifolds with torus boundary,
Y1 and Y2, and a map ϕ : ∂Y1 → ∂Y2, we can deﬁne the spliced manifold Yϕ by gluing Y1
and Y2 along their boundaries, by the map ϕ.

As another application of this technology, we give a large class of twisted torus knots in
S1× S2 that have generalised solid torus complements. In [9], Vafaee gives a class of twisted
torus knots in S3 that are L-space knots, which is extended by Motegi in [5]. We will show
how these results can be applied to the study of twisted torus knots in S1 × S2 with Floer
simple complements, and extend the classiﬁcation.
Theorem 1.4. The twisted torus knot complement S1 × S2 \ T (p, q; s, r) is a generalized
solid torus if (p, q) = 1 and s ≡ ±q (p).

We can use this to produce an set of examples to resolve a question asked in [6].

Corollary 1.5. There exists an inﬁnite set of distinct Floer simple manifolds with the same
Turaev torsion.

While studying this problem we also come across an interesting class of two component

link complements.
Theorem 1.6. There exists an inﬁnite family of manifolds Zp,q with ∂Zp,q = T 2 ∪ T 2 such
that any ﬁlling Zp,q(α, β) with b1(Zp,q(α, β)) = 0 is an L-space.

Acknowledgements: The author would like to thank his supervisor Jacob Rasmussen for
introducing this problem, and for support and helpful conversations throughout.

2. Generalized solid tori

First, we will ﬁx some conventions and notation. Throughout, Y will be a rational
homology S1 × D2. Let λ be the homological longitude and µ a meridian of ∂Y . Write
H1(Y ) = Z ⊕ T , i : H1(∂Y ) → H1(Y ) for the induced inclusion map. Then

Im(i) = gY Z ⊕ Z/gY Z = gY Z ⊕ T (cid:48) ⊂ H1(Y )

where i(µ) generates gY Z and σ := i(λ) generates T (cid:48).
Finally, let ι : H1(Y ) → H1(Y (λ)) = Z ⊕ T ∗ ∼= Z ⊕ T /T (cid:48) and kY = |T ∗|.
where t generates the free part of H1(Y ). By writing (1 − t)−1 =(cid:80)∞

Fix a projection of the free part φ : H1(Y ) → Z and let t be a generator of H1(Y )/T .
Let τ (Y ) be the Turaev torsion, which is an element of (1− t)−1Z[H1(Y )] ⊂ Q(Z[H1(Y )],
i=0 ti, we can consider

τ (Y ) as an element of the Novikov ring

Λφ[H1(Y )] =

ah[h]

(cid:110) (cid:88)

h∈H1(Y )

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) #{h| ah (cid:54)= 0, φ(h) < k} < ∞ for all k

(cid:111)

.

i.e. as a formal sum of elements in H1(Y ). We will normalise τ (Y ) so that ah = 0 for ϕ(H) <
0 and a0 (cid:54)= 0. With this representation, we can deﬁne S[τ (Y )] = {h ∈ H1(Y )| ah (cid:54)= 0}, the
support of τ (Y ). We say that Y is Floer simple if L(Y ) is an interval inside Sl(Y ).
Finally, we deﬁne an analogue of the Alexander polynomial. Let Φ : Λφ[H1(Y )] →
Z[t, t−1] be the map induce from ϕ, then set ∆(Y ) = (1 − t)Φ(τ (Y )).
Deﬁnition 2.1 ([6, Deﬁnition 1.5]). If Y is a Floer simple manifold, we deﬁne

Dτ≥0(Y ) = {x − y | x /∈ S[τ (Y )], y ∈ S[τ (Y )], φ(x) ≥ φ(y)} ∩ im ι ⊂ H1(Y )

and write Dτ

>0(Y ) for the subset of Dτ≥0(Y ) consisting of those elements with φ(h) > 0.

Figure 1. Conventions and notation

The signiﬁcance of this deﬁnition is demonstrated by [6, Theorem 1.6], which says that
if Y is Floer simple then either i−1(Dτ
>0(Y )) is empty, in which case L(Y ) = Sl(Y ) − {l},
or it is nonempty and L(Y ) is a closed interval whose endpoints are consecutive elements of
Dτ
>0(Y ). I.e. the set Dτ
>0(Y ) (and hence the Turaev torsion) along with one L-space ﬁlling,
completely determines L(Y ).

Finally, we need to deﬁne the notion of a generalized solid torus.

Deﬁnition 2.2. A generalized solid torus is a Floer simple manifold Y with deg ∆(Y ) < gY .

This deﬁnition is motivated by the fact that if Y is Floer simple and deg ∆(Y ) < gY , then
Dτ
>0(Y ) = ∅ ([6, Proposition 7.1]). This can be compared to the notion of solid torus-like
manifolds introduced by Hanselman and Watson in [4], which we will deﬁne and discuss
later.

Clearly all solid torus-like manifold are also generalised solid tori. We will show later
that they also must have gY = 1, which (combined with our main theorem) greatly restricts
their form.

We are now in a position to prove our main theorem. The primary improvement over the
proof of Rasmussen and Rasmussen in [6] is a more careful treatment of the Turaev torsion,
using lemma 2.5, which allows us to more precisely control the behaviour of the polynomials
qi,s deﬁned below.

Lemma 2.5. [8, VII.1.5] With Y as above,

ι([τ (Y )]) = ±(tgY − 1)[τ ](Y (λ)) + ΣY (λ)PY (t)

for some polynomial PY (t).

Write

Since Dτ

>0 = ∅, if the coeﬃcient (in τ ) of some sσatk is 1, then the coeﬃcient of sσa(cid:48)

tk+ngY
must also be 1 for all a(cid:48) and k > 0. So there is at most one value of n such that the polynomial
qk+ngY ,s(σ) is not either 0 or ΣY (λ). Therefore, the subsequence qk+ngY ,s(1) must look like
0, 0, ..., 0, qk+nk,sgY ,s(1), gY , gY , ...
Z/gY Z, i.e.

We now cut up Qs(t) into groups of powers of t that correspond to equivalence classes in

Qs,k(t) :=

qk+ngY ,s(1)tk+ngY − PY,k(t) − gY

tk+ngY

where Ck = (cid:100)(C−k)/gY (cid:101) and PY,k(t) contains the terms within PY (t) of the form ctk+ngY .
Clearly this process preserves divisibility by tgY − 1, and so we also have divisibility of the
following diﬀerences (wlog nk,s(cid:48) ≥ nk,s)

(tgY − 1) | (Qs,k(t) − Qs(cid:48),k(t))

= qk+nk,sgY ,s(1)tk+nk,sgY + gY

nk,s(cid:48)−1(cid:88)

tk+ng + (gY − qk+nk,s(cid:48) gY ,s(cid:48)(1))tk+nk,s(cid:48) gY

from which we can conclude that nk,s(cid:48) = nk,s and qk+ngY ,s(1) = qk+ngY ,s(cid:48)(1) for all s, s(cid:48).

So if we write ai = qi,s(1), we get a simple form for the Milnor torsion

where pr : Z[H1(Y )] → Z[H1(Y )/T ].
The rest of the proof proceeds analogously to [6], but we outline it here for clarity and

completeness.

Lemma 2.6. There is a constant c so that (cid:80)

kY ai ≡ kY (k + c) (gY ).

i≡k (gY )

Proof. By [6, Lemma 7.3], p( ¯∆(t)) = p((t − 1)¯τ (Y )) ∼ kY (1 − tgY )/(1 − t) where p :
Z[t] → Z[t]/(tgY − 1), so ¯∆(t) can be obtained from kY (1 − tgY ) by moves of the form
f (t) → f (t) + ti − tgY −i and f (t) → tcf (t). It is then suﬃcient to note that if f (t)/(1− t) =
(cid:3)

(cid:80)∞
i=0 aiti satisﬁes the conditions of the lemma, so do wf (t) + ti − tgY −i and tcf (t).
This implies that the subsequence (kY ak+ngY ) has the form

so ¯τ (Y ) is obtained from

0, 0, ..., 0, kY k, kY gY , kY gY , ....

¯τ0 = kY (t + 2t2 + ... + (gY − 1)tgY −1 + gY tgY + gY tgY +1 + ...) = kY

tgY − 1
(t − 1)2

by elementary shifts of the form kY (ati + (gY − a)ti+gY ).
Finally, consider the map F (Q(t)) = p((1 − t)Q(t)), p : Z[t] → Z[t]/(tgY − 1). One can
check that if f (t)− g(t) = kY (ati + (gY − a)ti+gY ), F (f )− F (g) = gY kY (ti− ti+1). But since
tgY −1
¯τ (Y ) is obtained from ¯τ0 by these shifts, and since F ( ¯τ0) = kY
(t−1) = F (¯τ (Y )), all residue
classes must be shifted by the same amount, i.e. ¯τ (Y ) ∼ ¯τ0. Hence Y is a generalised solid
torus.
(cid:3)

We have the following corollary, which follows immediately as an extension of [6, Propo-

sition 1.9] (and which contains Theorem 1.2).

Corollary 2.7. The following are equivalent

(1) L(Y ) = Sl(Y ) − {l}.
>0(Y ) = ∅.
(2) Y is Floer simple and Dτ
(3) Y is Floer simple and has genus 0.
(4) Y has genus 0 and has an L-space ﬁlling.

This immediately gives us a result about solid torus-like manifolds, which we deﬁne now.

Deﬁnition 2.8 ([4, Deﬁnition 3.23]). A loop-type manifold M is solid torus like if it is a
rational homology solid torus and every loop in the representation of (cid:92)CF D(M, α, β) is solid
torus-like. Equivalently, Dτ≥0(Y ) = ∅.
Corollary 2.9. If Y is solid torus-like, then it is boundary compressible.
Proof. A solid torus-like manifold has Dτ≥0(Y ) = ∅, and so Dτ
generator Σ of H2(Y, ∂Y ) with genus 0.

Also, since Dτ≥0(Y ) = ∅, we must have that qi,s(σ) = (cid:80)gY

i=0 σi for all i and s, and so
i=0 ti. Therefore gY = 1 by [6, Lemma 7.3]. So Σ is a compressing disk for
(cid:3)

>0(Y ) = ∅. Hence there is a

(cid:80)∞

¯∆(t) = kY gY
Y .

We will now turn our attention to an application to splicing of manifolds. Suppose that
Y1 and Y2 are rational homology solid tori, ϕ : ∂Y1 → ∂Y2 is an orientation reversing
diﬀeomorphism. We say that Yϕ = Y1 ∪ϕ Y2 is obtained by splicing Y1 and Y2 together
along ϕ.

Proof. By 2.9 the Yi are not solid torus-like, and we can apply [3, Theorem 7].

(cid:3)

3. Twisted Torus Knots

In an eﬀort to ﬁnd examples of generalised solid tori, we now turn our attention to twisted
torus knots. We write T (p, q; s, r) for the knot in ﬁgure 2, considered as a knot in S1 × S2.

p − s

s

r

q/p

Figure 2. The twisted torus knot T (p, q; s, r)

In [9], Vafaee studies twisted torus knots K(p, q; s, r) ⊂ S3, and classiﬁes as subset that

have L-space ﬁllings proving
Theorem 3.1 ([9, Theorem 1]). For p ≥ 2, k ≥ 1, r > 0 and 0 < s < p, the twisted torus
knot, K(p, kp ± 1; s, r), is an L-space knot if and only if either s = p − 1 or s ∈ {2, p − 2}
and r = 1.

This theorem can be used to prove the existence class of generalised solid tori as comple-

ments of knots in S1 × S2.
Corollary 3.2. For p ≥ 2, k ≥ 1, r > 0 and 0 < s < p, the complement of the twisted torus
knot, T (p, kp ± 1; s, r) ⊂ S1 × S2, is a generalised solid torus if either s ∈ {1, p − 1} or
s ∈ {2, p − 2} and r = 1.

We could similarly extend the results of Motegi to twisted torus knots in S1×S2. Instead,

we will give a more direct geometric proof.
Theorem 3.3. The twisted torus knot complement S1 × S2 \ T (p, q; s, r) is a generalized
solid torus if (p, q) = 1 and s ≡ ±q (p).

To prove this theorem, we require a lemma concerning the existence of a surface in the

knot complement.

of L1 and B ⊂ {0, 1} × D2.

There exists an embedded surface Σ ⊂ I × D2 − ν(L) satisfying the following properties:
(1) The boundary of Σ consists of q parallel copies of { 1
2}×∂D2, p copies of the longitude
(2) If we glue {0} × D2 to {1} × D2 by an automorphism of D2 that shifts each strand
of L left q times (i.e. the gluing that will close L2 to form a p/q torus knot), the
boundary components in B join up to each other to form a surface Σ(cid:48) with boundary
only on L1 and I × ∂D2. Moreover, Σ(cid:48) has genus 0.

(3) Σ ∩ S × [0, 1/2] = ∅

Proof. We will build Σ inductively. Let w = kp+q, and consider the black tangle L ⊂ I×D2
in ﬁgure 5.

Figure 5. A link and an embedded surface in I × D2. The green cylinder
contains a reﬂected copy of ﬁgure 4. The pink pipes run through the holes
in the blue surface.

Then by induction we can ﬁnd a surface in a neighbourhood of the ﬁrst p strands and L1,
whose boundary components are p copies of the longitude of L1, q copies of the longitude of
L2 and a boundary component B ⊂ {0, 1}× D2. Call this surface Σ0 and write B = B0∪ B1
where Bi ⊂ i × D2. Also note that Σ0 is ‘surrounded’ by L2.
Next, take k − 1 copies of B1 × I and insert them along the k − 1 remaining groups of p
strands, i.e. the ﬁrst one along the strands p + 1, ..., 2p, the second along 2p + 1, ..., 3p etc.
Along the ﬁnal q strands of the braid, we paste a copy of B(cid:48) × I, where B(cid:48) consists of the
components of B0 contained inside the circle S. Take the union of all of the pieces that we

L-SPACE FILLINGS AND GENERALIZED SOLID TORI

have deﬁned so far, and call it Σ1. Notice that at this stage, the p/w twisted gluing will
correctly match up all boundary components of Σ1 inside {0, 1} × D2 (since w ≡ q (p)).
Next we take p parallel copies of the blue surface in ﬁgure 5. As shown in the picture,
each blue surface has one boundary component on I × ∂D2, k boundary components Ci
containing p strands, and one boundary component E containing q strands.
For C1, we run a pipe along the outside of Σ1 to join C1 to L2, and k − 1 parallel copies
of pipes from {1} × D2 to L2 each running inside the previous pipe, but still outside of Σ1.
An example is shown in ﬁgure 5, shown in pink. Similarly for each other Ci, run a pipe
from Ci to {0} × D2, and k + 1 − i pipes inside that one from {1} × D2 to {0} × D2, all of
them running outside of Σ1. Repeat this process for each parallel copy of the blue surface.
Call this new surface Σ2, and notice that the boundary components still all match up under
a p/w twisted gluing. Also notice that the boundary of Σ2 contains p parallel copies of
2} × ∂D2 and w = q + kp copies of the longitude of L2.

(cid:96) pD2

To check the genus, write Σ(cid:48)

Finally we run a pipe down from each copy of the ﬁnal blue boundary component E, and
p parallel pipes joining the red circle S to L1. We know by condition 3 that these pipes don’t
intersect Σ2. These p boundary components on L1 can be paired up with the p existing
boundary components on L1, and pushed oﬀ. Finally we do an ∞ ﬁlling on L1 to get our
surface Σ.
1 for the gluing of Σ1, and Σ(cid:48) for the gluing of our new surface
Σ. Note that Σ(cid:48)
1 is homeomorphic to the surface that we would get by gluing Σ0 inside ﬁgure
4, and so has genus 0. To obtain Σ(cid:48)
2, we just added p copies of the blue surface (and some
pipes) all of which are disjoint from Σ(cid:48)
k is a k-punctured
disc. So Σ(cid:48)
2 consists of p + 1 disjoint pieces all of which have genus 0. The ﬁnal step simply
1, so clearly Σ(cid:48)
glues one boundary component of each D2
has genus 0.
(cid:3)
Lemma 3.5. Let ri ∈ Q ∪ {∞}, r1 (cid:54)= 0 and r3 (cid:54)= ∞. Then the ﬁlling Yr1,0,r3 of the
following link L ⊂ S3 (in ﬁgure 6) is an L-space.
Proof. Note that Y−,0,r3 has genus 0, since we can take the surface Σ from lemma 3.4 and
cap oﬀ the boundary components on L2. Also, Y∞,0,r3 is an L-space since it is the r3
ﬁlling of T (p, q) ⊂ S1 × S2, which is a generalized solid torus by 3.2. So by theorem 1.2,
L(Y−,0,r3) = Sl(Y−,0,r3) − {l}, hence Yr1,0,r3 is an L-space.
(cid:3)
Proof of theorem 3.3. S1 × S2 \ T (p, q; q, r) = S1 × S2 \ T (p, q; q(cid:48), r) = Y1/r,0,−, so by the
above lemma all of the non-longitudinal ﬁllings are L-spaces. Hence S1 × S2 \ T (p, q; s, r) is
(cid:3)
a generalized solid torus.

Note ﬁnally that condition 3 is clearly satisﬁed by the construction.

Theorem 1.6 then follows easily by considering the family of manifolds Y ,0, above, for

all p and q.

This class of manifolds allows us to resolve a question of Rasmussen and Rasmussen.
In [6], Rasmussen and Rasmussen asked if there are inﬁnitely many distinct Floer simple
manifolds with the same Turaev torsion. We can build such a family as follows. Consider
the manifold Y ,0, as above, with p = 5 and q = s = 2. Using SnapPy ([2]) we can check
that this manifold is hyperbolic, and apply Thurston’s hyperbolic Dehn ﬁlling theorem.

Theorem 3.6 (Thurston’s hyperbolic Dehn ﬁlling theorem ([7]). Suppose M is hyperbolic
and M (p/q) is the ﬁlling of one of the boundary components of M . Then

• M (p/q) is hyperbolic for all but ﬁnitely many p/q

• vol(M (p/q)) < vol(M ) when M (p/q) is hyperbolic
• vol(M (p/q)) → vol(M ) as p2 + q2 → ∞

Therefore there is some subsequence Y1/ri,0, that are distinct (since they have diﬀerent
hyperbolic volumes) but have the same ∆. Since, for a Floer simple manifold, there are only
ﬁnitely many possible torsions corresponding to a choice of ∆, there must therefore be an
inﬁnite set of distinct Floer simple manifolds with the same torsion.
