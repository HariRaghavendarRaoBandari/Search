Spin manipulation is one of the most critical challenges to realize spin-based logic devices and
spintronic circuits. Graphene has been heralded as an ideal material to achieve spin manipulation but
so far new paradigms and demonstrators are limited. Here we show that certain impurities such as
ﬂuorine ad-atoms, which locally break sublattice symmetry without the formation of strong magnetic
moment, could result in a remarkable variability of spin transport characteristics. The impurity
resonance level is found to be associated with a long range sublattice pseudospin polarization, which
by locally decoupling spin and pseudospin dynamics, provokes a huge spin lifetime electron-hole
asymmetry. In the dilute impurity limit, spin lifetimes could be tuned electrostatically from hundred
picoseconds to several nanoseconds, providing a protocol to chemically engineer an unprecedented
spin device functionality.

Introduction. The possibility to ﬁne tune the elec-
tronic, charge and spin transport properties of graphene
using chemical functionalization1–4,
irradiation (defect
formation)5, electric ﬁelds6 or antidot fabrication7 has
become an exciting ﬁeld of research with almost end-
less possibilities. In particular, chemical treatments such
as ozonisation, hydrogenation, or ﬂuorination, introduc-
ing a variable density of surface ad-atoms from typically
0.001% to few percent, have demonstrated a large spec-
trum of accessible physical states from anomalous trans-
port to highly insulating behavior of chemically reactive
graphene derivatives8–12. On the other hand, graphene
exhibits long room temperature spin lifetime and rich
surface chemistry opportunities which could be harnessed
for the development of all-spin logic technologies13–20. As
a matter of illustration, the use of chemical ﬂuorination
of graphene bilayer has been shown to yield very high
spin injection eﬃciency (above 60%), owing to improved
interface spin ﬁltering21.

Spin lifetime is an essential quantity that ﬁxes the up-
per time and length scales on which spin devices can op-
erate, so that knowing its value and variability are prereq-
uisite to realizing graphene spintronic technologies. The
sources of spin relaxation turn out to be diversiﬁed in
graphene, and extrinsic disorder driven by ad-atom im-
purities can signiﬁcantly enhanced spin-orbit interaction
around defects1, or create local magnetism22; both ef-
fects usually reducing spin lifetimes, even in the dilute
limit23–31.

The nature of spin relaxation in graphene has been
initially discussed either in terms of Elliot-Yafet24 or
Dyakonov-Perel32 mechanisms, depending on the scaling
of spin lifetime with defect density. However recently,
a novel spin relaxation mechanism in non-magnetic
graphene samples has been connected to the unique
spin-pseudospin entanglement occurring near the Dirac

point, pointing towards revisiting the role of sublattice
pseudospin33.

Sublattice pseudospin is an additional quantum de-
gree of freedom, mathematically very similar to spin and
unique to graphene sublattice degeneracy1. In absence of
spin-orbit coupling, the low-energy electronic states write
Ψ~k(~r) ∼ (ψA(1, 0)T + ψB(0, 1)T) × ei~k~r, where (1, 0)T
and (0, 1)T deﬁne up and down-pseudospin states, while
ψA (resp. ψB) give the wavefunction weight restricted
to A (resp. B) sublattice sites1,34. In addition to sub-
lattice pseudospin, valley isospin (for the two K-points
in the reciprocal space) also shows up in the electronic
wavefunctions, and harnessing these degrees of freedom is
the target of ”Valleytronics and Pseudospintronics”35,36.
The complex interplay between sublattice pseudospin
and valley isospin is currently the source of innovative
device proposals such as valley or pseudospin ﬁltering
and switches6,37–42.

In presence of a Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) ﬁeld
either generated by a substrate-induced electric ﬁeld or a
weak density of metal ad-atoms (gold, nickel), spin and
pseudospin become strongly coupled at the Dirac point
where the eigenstates take the form Ψ~k= ~K ∼ (1, 0)T × | ↓
i ± i(0, 1)T × | ↑i, where | ↓i and | ↑i denote the spin
state33,43. Such spin-pseudospin locking drives to an en-
tangled dynamics of spin and pseudospin resulting in
fast spin dephasing, even when approaching the ballis-
tic limit33, with increasing spin lifetimes away from the
Dirac point, as observed experimentally44. This phe-
nomenon suggests ways to engineer spin manipulation
based on controlling the pseudospin degree of freedom
(or vice versa), which would help in the development of
spin logics16,19,20.

In this Letter, we reveal that chemical functionaliza-
tion of graphene with certain types of ad-atoms such as

ﬂuorine, by breaking the sublattice symmetry and by in-
ducing a SOC without the formation of strong magnetic
moment, provide an enabling technique to monitor spin
transport properties in a remarkable way for spintronic
applications. The ﬂuorine ad-atoms indeed produce hole
impurity levels which exhibit a long range spatial sub-
lattice pseudospin polarization (SPP), which counteracts
the homogeneous Rashba SOC ﬁeld at the origin of the
intrinsic spin precession and relaxation in the otherwise
ﬂuorine free samples45. As a result, spin and pseudospin
dynamics are not anymore coupled at the impurity reso-
nances, which lead to the possibility to electrostatically
tune spin lifetime by up to one order of magnitude (for
instance under electrostatic gating). This is a theoretical
opportunity for designing a new kind of spin transistor
eﬀect based on a gate-controlled spin transport length.
Calculations are performed using a realistic tight-binding
model elaborated from ab-initio calculations, whereas the
spin dynamics is computed through the time-evolution of
the expectation value of the spin operator projected on
a real space basis set.

Tight-binding description of ﬂuorinated graphene. The
description of ﬂuorine ad-atom on graphene is achieved
using a tight-binding model elaborated from ab-initio
simulations46. The Hamiltonian for the system involves
two parts:

H = HG + HF G

(1)

I = 3.3 meV, ΛR = 11.2 meV, and ΛB

with all the parameters ǫF = −2.2 eV, T = 5.5 eV,
ΛB
P IA = 7.3 meV
are derived from ab-initio simulations46. The operator F
(F +) annihilates (creates) an electron in the atomic pz
orbital on ﬂuorine F. A and B (A+ and B+ ) denote the
annihilation (creation) operators for pz orbital on ﬂuori-
nated carbons and their nearest neighbors, respectively.
The ﬁrst term in above Hamiltonian is the on-site energy
term on the ﬂuorine ad-atoms and the second term is the
hopping term between ﬂuorine ad-atoms F and ﬂuori-
nated carbon A ≡ CF . The third and the fourth terms
which are similar to the SOC terms in Eq.(2) simulate
the local intrinsic and Rashba SOCs induced by the ab-
sorption of ﬂuorine on graphene. Finally the last term,
the new SOC term, coming from the pseudospin inversion
asymmetry (PIA) mediates the spin-ﬂip hopping between
two second nearest neighbors Bi. It is worth mentioning
that we are using the π-orbital tight binding model which
is diﬀerent from a recent paper on the electronic struc-
tures and optical properties of ﬂuorinated graphene in
which the multi-orbital tight-binding was employed49.

Spin dynamics methodology. The spin dynamics of
electron in ﬂuorinated graphene is investigated using
the time-dependent evolution of the spin polarization of
propagating wavepackets33. Simulations of samples of
µm2 size are performed, containing hundred millions of
carbon atoms (N ∼ 108). The time-evolution of the spin
polarization is computed through

The ﬁrst part describes the graphene in a homogeneous
SOC ﬁeld induced by the substrate or gate voltage

where γ0 is the usual π-orbital hopping term between
nearest-neighbors, λI = 12 µeV is commonly value used
for the intrinsic SOC of graphene47 while the Rashba
SOC λR is an electric ﬁeld-dependent quantity. In this
study we take λR = 37.4 µeV taken from an extended
sp-band tight-binding model48 for graphene under the
inﬂuence of an electric ﬁeld of 0.1 V /˚A , induced by the
substrate or the gate voltage.

where ~s are the spin Pauli matrices and δ(E − H) is
the spectral measure operator. The time evolution of
electronic wavepackets |Ψ(t)i is obtained by solving the
Schr¨odinger equation50,51, starting from random-phase
states |Ψ(t = 0)i = |ϕRPi with an initial out-of-plane
(z direction) or in-plane polarization (x, y direction).

as |ϕRPi = 1√N PN

(Φj, θj) gives the spin orientation of orbital |ji in the
spherical coordinate, whereas αj is a random number in
the [0, 1] interval33. An energy broadening parameter η is
introduced for expanding δ(E − H) through a continued
fraction expansion of the Green’s function50,51. An aver-
age over few tens of random phases states is usually suf-
ﬁcient to converge the expectation values. This method
has been previously used to investigate spin relaxation
in gold-decorated graphene33, hydrogenated graphene26
and recently, SOC coupled graphene under the eﬀect of
electron-hole puddles45.

Impurity resonance and sublattice pseudospin polariza-
tion. Electronic calculations show that unlike hydrogen,
the ﬂuorine adatom is a broad scatterer46. The density
of states (DOS) of a 40 × 40 supercell (about 0.03%) ex-
hibits a resonant peak at about 260 meV46 below the
Dirac point. Fig. 1 shows the local density of state
(LDOS) on the sites close to the ﬂuorinated carbon CF

Such remarkable features are further manifested in
the spin lifetime τs (Fig.
2c, main frame), which
are extracted from the spin polarization by ﬁtting the
obtained data with an exponential decay Px,z(t) =
Px,z(t0)e−(t−t0)/τ ||,⊥
(dashed lines in the inset of Fig.
2c). This ﬁtting is performed starting from the time
t0 = 30 ps to avoid the initially transient fast decay
which is usually observed for strong disorder, especially
at DP26. The spin lifetime exhibits a strong electron-
hole asymmetry with huge increase of spin lifetime with
a maximum close to but not exactly at the resonant en-
ergy (about one order of magnitude compared to one in
the electron side).

FIG. 2. (a) and (b) show ball-and-stick models for ﬂuorine
functionalized graphene for two diﬀerent densities. (c) spin
relaxation time τs for in-plane || and out-of-plane ⊥ spin com-
ponents for 0.01% and 0.02% of ﬂuorine on graphene (dashed

s for 0.01% ﬂuorine, neglecting the SOC term). In-
set: spin polarization evolution at the Dirac point and at res-
onant energy ER for 0.01% and 0.02% of ﬂuorine on graphene.

The energy of this maximum is shifted to the hole side
compared to the resonant energy ER and this energy shift
increases with the ﬂuorine concentration. This shift is at-
tributed to the SOC eﬀects caused by ﬂuorine ad-atoms.
Indeed, turning oﬀ the SOC induced by ﬂuorine leads to
the spin lifetime (dashed line) with the peak exactly at
resonant energy ER. More remarkably, the increase of
ﬂuorine percentage leads to an enhancement of τs (Fig.
2c). This is counterintuitive because ﬂuorine was pre-
dicted to induce a giant SOC in graphene which should
lead to a decrease of spin lifetime with ﬂuorine density
46. Actually, the SOC induced by ﬂuorine does not
ρF
play a major role here. Indeed, in absence of SOC in-
duced by ﬂuorine (ΛB
I = ΛR = ΛP IA = 0), τs shows

using the tight-binding model for H (Eq.(1)). All the
LDOSs present a strong electron-hole asymmetry with
broad peaks at about ER = −0.125γ0 = −325 meV
which are evidences of ﬂuorine-induced resonant eﬀect.
More interestingly, the height of resonant peaks discloses
a sublattice asymmetry with less state occupancy on the
sublattice related to the ﬂuorinated carbon CF . This
is the signature of a SPP which is present in graphene
when the A-B symmetry is broken such as in the case
of hydrogenated, nitrogen-doped graphene or graphene
with vacancies. Fluorine ad-atoms induce a long range
pseudospin-polarized region. Fig. 1 (inset) shows the
LDOS at the resonant energy ER (represented by the ra-
dius of circles) on more than 300 atoms around the ﬂuo-
rinated carbon (marked by the green dot). At the edge of
this area one can still see the diﬀerence between LDOSs
on two diﬀerent sublattices. Here we will show that the
SPP has a direct impact on spin lifetime in ﬂuorinated
graphene.

Strong electron-hole asymmetry of the spin lifetime.
We compute the expectation value of the out-of-plane
spin component Pz(E, t) = P⊥(E, t) and the in-plane
spin component Px(E, t) = Pk(E, t) of spin polariza-
tion in ﬂuorinated graphene using Eq.(4). Fig. 2c (in-
set) shows the evolution of spin polarization Pz(t) at the
Dirac point (black and green solid lines) and at the res-
onant energies ER (red and blue solid lines) for 0.01%
and 0.02% of ﬂuorine on graphene. There are two inter-
esting features of the spin signals. The ﬁrst one is the
remarkably slow decay of the time-evolution of the spin
polarization at the resonance (E = ER) compared to that
occurring at the Dirac point. The second characteristic
is the enhancement of spin polarization when increasing
the percentage of ﬂuorine (see illustration in Fig. 2a and

similar energy dependence (see dashed line in Fig. 2c
for τ⊥s and 0.01% ﬂuorine atoms neglecting their SOC
contribution).

Dyakonov-Perel mechanism. Fluorine ad-atoms also
induce momentum scattering which yield randomization
of the spin precession. This usually leads to a Dyakonov-
Perel relaxation mechanism in which the spin lifetime τs
is inversely proportional the momentum relaxation time
τp, i.e. τ||s = 2τ⊥s = 2/(2λ2
Rτp)32,52–54. This scaling
can be clearly observed in Fig. 2c where τs upscales
with the ﬂuorine density ρF almost linearly as expected
from a Fermi golden rule argument. To further conﬁrm
the mechanism at play, the momentum relaxation time
τp is computed numerically using a real-space order-N
approach51.

Fig. 3a shows the energy dependence of τp for 0.02% of
ﬂuorine on graphene with a minimum close to ER, pin-
pointing the resonance induced by ﬂuorine (identiﬁed by
the peak in the LDOS of atoms in the distance of twice
carbon bond length from CF , see red dashed line). To
further conﬁrm the relaxation mechanism, we compute
the product of τsτp (see Fig. 3b). The obtained nu-
merical data (black solid line) close to the resonance are
fairly consistent with a Dyakonov-Perel mechanism (red
dashed line) up to a factor α ∈ [0.6; 1.4] (τ||s τp = α2
).

A ﬁnal evidence is given by the spin lifetime anisotropy
of τs obtained in Fig. 3c. Indeed, the ratio of in-plane
and out-of-plane spin lifetimes τ||s /τ⊥s ∼ 2 (within 10%
error), well agrees with analytical calculations performed
in model systems54. Some deviation is observed close to
the Dirac point, where the spin-pseudospin entanglement
eﬀects are maximized.

Discussion.

The enhancement and the energy-

4

dependence of τs is a direct consequence of defect-induced
sublattice pseudospin polarization (illustrated in Fig. 1,
inset).
In supported ultraclean graphene, the Rashba
SOC λR induced by the substrate or the gate voltage
dictates the spin dephasing of propagating charges, as
shown experimentally44. It is worth mentioning that the
spin lifetime caused by this background Rashba SOC is
totally electron-hole symmetric45. On the hole side, the
induced SPP around ﬂuorine defects locally suppress the
Rashba SOC and consequently enhance spin lifetime up
to the range of nanoseconds whereas τs is more strongly
reduced on the electron side, with τs ∼ 100 ps. This
phenomenon can be qualitatively understood using both
the continuum and tight-binding models.
In the con-
tinuum model, the Hamiltonian HG (Eq.(2)), including
spin-orbit interaction, can be approximated as hG(~k) =
vF (ησxkx+σyky)+λR(ησxsy −σysx)+λI ησzsz, where σ
and s are Pauli matrices representing the sublattice pseu-
dospin and spin degrees of freedom respectively, while
η = 1(−1) corresponds to the K (K’) valley (here inter-
valley coupling is neglected in the discussion). The mag-
nitude of the Rashba magnetic ﬁeld is proportional to the
in-plane component of pseudospin (σx, σy)33 which is re-
duced by approaching the area around ﬂuorine due to the
formation of SPP. The reduction of local eﬀective Rashba
magnetic ﬁeld entails the enhancement of spin lifetimes
which is maximum close to the resonant energy ER where
the SPP is maximum. In the tight-binding model, the
peculiar sublattice occupancy of impurity states gives
rise to an increase of the next-nearest-neighbor hopping
probability (intrinsic SOC) and a decrease of the nearest-
neighbor hopping probability (Rashba SOC), which be-
ing the main factor for spin relaxation, also explains the
spin lifetime enhancement.

One notes that SPP is not unique to ﬂuorine adsorp-
tion in the weak density limit, but can be also gener-
ated by nitrogen substitutions55, grafted molecules56, hy-
drogen ad-atoms or any other eﬀect breaking A-B sub-
lattice symmetry. However the unveiled phenomenon
of electron-hole spin transport asymmetry should be
maximized in absence of magnetic moments, which
disfavor long spin propagation25,26. Besides,
in con-
trast to the Elliot-Yafet mechanism predicted for mag-
netic impurities25,26,30, ad-atoms such as ﬂuorine are
here shown to entail a Dyakonov-Perel mechanism, in
agreement with many experiments on functionalized
graphene57,58. We note that the considered dilute ﬂu-
orine limit is accessible experimentally59,60, and that
chemical bonding of ﬂuorine ad-atoms is theoretically
tunable with electric ﬁeld61–63, a fact which could help
controlling the level of adsorption and the possibility to
switch on and oﬀ the spin transport asymmetry gener-
ated by impurities. Finally we observe that spin dynam-
ics could be a smoking gun for unveiling new quantum
phase transition resulting from the competition between
diﬀerent ground states (such as those characterized by
spin-degenerate and magnetic bound states64), or to scru-
tinize the origin of the saturation of coherence times in

weak localization measurements65.
