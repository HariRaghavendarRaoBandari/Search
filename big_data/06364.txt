Spectral Asymptotics for Fractional

Laplacians

Victor Ivrii

April 5, 2016

Abstract

In this article we consider fractional Laplacians which seem to
be of interest to probability theory. This is a rather new class of
operators for us but our methods works (with a twist, as usual). Our
main goal is to derive a two-term asymptotics as one-term asymptotics
is easily obtained by R. Seeley’s method.

In this section we consider fractional Laplacians.
This is a rather new class of operators for us but our methods works
(with a twist, as usual). Our main goal is to derive a two-term asymptotics
as one-term asymptotics is rather easily obtained by R. Seeley’s method.

1 Problem set-up
Let us consider a bounded domain X ⊂ ℝd with the smooth boundary
𝜕X ∈ C ∞ 1). In this domain we consider a fractional Laplacian 𝝠m = (𝝙m/𝟤)𝖣
with m > 𝟢 originally defined on functions u ∈ C ∞(ℝd ) : u|𝜕X = 𝟢 by

(1.1)

𝝠m,X := (𝝙m/𝟤)𝖣u = RX 𝝙m/𝟤(θX u)

where θX is a characteristic function of X , RX is an operator of restriction to
X and 𝝙m/𝟤 is a standard pseudodifferential operator in ℝd with the Weyl
symbol g (x, 𝜉)m/𝟤 where as usual g is non-degenerate Riemannian metrics.

1) Alternatively consider a bounded domain X on the Riemannian manifold 𝒳 .

1

Remark 1.1. (i) We consider 𝝠m,X as an unbounded operator in L 𝟤(X )
with domain D(𝝠m,X ) = {u ∈ L 𝟤(ℝd ) : 𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉(u) ⊂ ̄X , RX 𝝠m ∈ L 𝟤(X )} ⊂
H m/𝟤

(X ).

𝟢

(ii) This operator can also be introduced through positive quadratic form
with domain {u ∈ H m(ℝd ), 𝗌𝗎𝗉𝗉(u) ⊂ ̄X} and is a positive self-adjoint
operator which is Friedrichs extension of operator originally defined on
H m

𝟢 (X ).

(X )

𝟢

𝟢

(X ).

(iii) We can consider this operator as a bounded operator from H m/𝟤
to H −m/𝟤(X ) := H −m/𝟤 *
(iv) Let 𝟢 < m /∈ 𝟤ℤ. Then D(𝝠m,X ) ⊂ H m(X ) if and only if m ∈ (𝟢, 𝟣);
otherwise even eigenfunctions of 𝝠m,X may not belong to H m(X ).
(v) Since 𝝠m does not possess transmission property as m /∈ 𝟤ℤ, we are not in
the framework of the Boutet-de-Monvel algebra, but pretty close: 𝝠m possess
𝜇-transmission property introduced by L. H¨ormander and systematically
studied by G. Grubb in [G1, G2]. We provide definition in Subsection 6.B.

We are interested in the asymptotics of the eigenvalue counting function

𝖭(𝜆) for 𝝠m,X as 𝜆 → +∞.

2 Preliminary analysis
As usual we reduce problem to a semiclassical one. Let A = hm𝝠m,X − 𝟣
with h = 𝜆−𝟣/m.
Proposition 2.1. Let ̄x ∈ X , B(̄x, 𝟤𝛾) ⊂ X , 𝛾 ≥ h. Then

(2.1)

and

(2.2)

∫︁

|

|e(x, x, 𝟢) − 𝖶𝖾𝗒𝗅(x)| ≤ Ch𝟣−d 𝛾−𝟣

∀x ∈ B(̄x, 𝛾)

(︁

𝜓((x − ̄x)/𝛾)

e(x, x, 𝟢) − 𝖶𝖾𝗒𝗅(x)

)︁

dx| ≤

Ch𝟣−d 𝛾d−𝟣(︀𝛾𝛿 + h𝛿𝛾−𝛿)︀

as 𝜓 ∈ C ∞

𝟢 (B(𝟢, 𝟣)) and 𝛿 > 𝟢.

Proof. Estimate (2.1) is easily proven by just rescaling as modulo O(hs𝛾−s)
we get a ℏ-pseudodifferential operator with ℏ = h𝛾−𝟣.

Estimate (2.2) is easily proven by rescaling plus R. Seeley’s method as

described in Subsection 7.5.1 of [Ivr]. We leave easy details to the reader.

Then we immediately arrive to

Corollary 2.2. (i) Contribution of the inner zone {x : 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍(x, 𝜕X ) ≥ h} to
the Weyl remainder does not exceed Ch𝟣−d .
(ii) Contribution of the intermediate strip {x : 𝜀 ≥ 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍(x, 𝜕X ) ≥ 𝜀−𝟣h} to
the Weyl remainder does not exceed 𝜂(𝜀)h𝟣−d with 𝜂(𝜀) → 𝟢 as 𝜀 → 𝟢.

Here and in what follows 𝜀 > 𝟢 is an arbitrarily small constant.

Proposition 2.3. The following estimate holds:
|e(x, x, 𝟢)| ≤ Ch−d .

(2.3)

Proof. The standard proof we leave to the reader.

Theorem 2.4. (i) For operator A Weyl remainder in the asymptotics for
𝖭− does not exceed Ch𝟣−d .

(ii) For operator 𝝠m,X the following asymptotics holds

𝖭(𝜆) = 𝜅𝟢𝜆

(2.4)
where 𝜅𝟢 = (𝟤𝜋)−d 𝜛d 𝗏𝗈𝗅(X ) and 𝗏𝗈𝗅(X ) means the Riemannian volume of
X .

d
m + O(𝜆

d−𝟣
m )

as 𝜆 → +∞

Proof. Statement (i) follows immediately from Corollary 2.2(i) and Proposi-
tion 2.3. Statement (ii) follows immediately from (i) as d ≥ 𝟤.

This was easy but recovering the second term is a much more daunting
task requiring first to improve the contribution of the near boundary strip
{x : 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍(x, 𝜕X ) ≤ 𝜀−𝟣h} and also of the inner zone {x : 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍(x, 𝜕X ) ≥ 𝜀}.

3 Propagation of singularities near
boundary

Without any loss of the generality one can assume that

(3.1)

X = {x : x𝟣 > 𝟢},

g jk = δ𝟣j ∀j = 𝟣, ... , d.

3

First let us study the propagation of singularities along the boundary:

Theorem 3.1. On the energy level 𝜏 : |𝜏| ≤ 𝜖𝟢
(i) x′ singularities propagate with the speed not exceeding c with respect to
(x′, 𝜉′).
(ii) As |𝜉′| ≍ 𝜌 ≥ Ch 𝟣
with respect to x.

𝟤−𝛿 singularities move from x′ = y′ with the speed ≍ 𝜌

Proof. The proof is standard as it involves only pseudodifferential operators
p(x, hD′) and their commutators with A but one can see easily that those
commutators do not bring any troubles as the energy level is ≍ 𝟣. We leave
all easy details to the reader.
Corollary 3.2. (i) Let 𝜌 ≥ Ch 𝟣
𝟤−𝛿, h𝟣−𝛿 ≤ 𝛾 ≤ 𝜖. Then the contribution
of the zone {(x, 𝜉′) : x𝟣 ≤ 𝛾,|𝜉′| ≍ 𝜌} to the Tauberian remainder with
T ∈ (T*(𝜌), T *(𝜌), T*(𝜌) = h𝟣−𝛿𝜌−𝟤, T *(𝜌) = 𝜖𝜌 does not exceed

C 𝜌d−𝟣h−d × 𝛾 × h𝟣−𝛿𝜌−𝟤 × 𝜌−𝟣.

(3.2)
(ii) The total contribution of the zone {(x, 𝜉′) : x𝟣 ≤ 𝛾 = h𝟣−𝛿} to the
Tauberian error with T = h𝟣−𝟥𝛿 does not exceed Ch−d+𝟣+𝛿.

Proof. The easy and standard proof of Statement (i) is left to the reader.
Then the contribution of the zone x𝟣 ≤ h𝟣−𝛿, |𝜉′| ≥ Ch𝛿 to the Tauberian
remainder with T = h𝟣−𝟥𝛿 does not exceed Ch−d+𝟣+𝛿. Since the contribution
of the zone {(x, 𝜉′) : x𝟣 ≤ 𝛾 = h𝟣−𝛿,|𝜉′| ≤ Ch𝟤𝛿} to the asymptotics does not
exceed C 𝜌d−𝟣h−d × 𝛾 ≤ Ch−d+𝟣+𝛿 we arrive to Statement (ii).

Therefore in this zone {(x, 𝜉′) : x𝟣 ≤ 𝛾 = h𝟣−𝛿} all we need is to pass

from the Tauberian asymptotics to Weyl ones.

However the inner zone should be reexamined and we need to describe
what happens with the propagation along Hamiltonian trajectory in the
zone {(x, 𝜉) : x𝟣 ≤ h𝟣−𝛿}. We can assume that |𝜉𝟣| ≥ 𝜀 since the measure

4

of the remaining trajectories is small, here 𝜀 > 𝟢 is an arbitrarily small
constant.

4 Reflection of singularities from the
boundary

4.1 Pilot model

We start from the pilot-model which will be used to prove the main case.
Namely, let us consider 𝟣-dimensional operator on half-line ℝ+ with Eu-
clidean metrics

x + a𝟤)m/𝟤)𝖣

B := Bm,a,h = ((h𝟤D 𝟤

(4.1)
with a ≥ 𝟢. We denote 𝗲m,a,h(x𝟣, y𝟣, 𝜏 ) the Schwartz kernel of its spectral
projector.
Observe that scaling x ↦→ x𝛾−𝟣, 𝜏 ↦→ 𝜏 𝜌−m transforms operator to one
with h ↦→ h/(𝜌𝛾), 𝜏 ↦→ 𝜏 𝜌−m; because of this we can assume that h = 𝟣 and
the second scaling implies that we can assume that either a = 𝟣 or 𝜏 = 𝟣.

Proposition 4.1. (i) The spectrum of operator 𝝠m,a is absolutely continuos
and it coincides with [am,∞).

(ii) The following equalities hold:
(4.2) 𝗲m,a,h(x, y , 𝜆) = 𝗲m,𝟣,ha−𝟣(ax, ay , 𝜆a−m) =

𝜆𝟣/m𝗲m,a𝜆−𝟣/m,h(𝜆𝟣/mx, 𝜆𝟣/my , 𝟣) = a𝗲m,𝟣,h(ax, ay , 𝜆a−m).

Proposition 4.2. Let 𝜓 ∈ C ∞
𝟢 ≤ a ≤ 𝟣 − 𝜏 𝟢. Then as 𝛾 ≥ h𝟣−𝛿, T ≥ C𝟢𝛾, h𝛿 ≥ 𝜂 ≥ h𝟣−𝛿T −𝟣
‖𝜑(𝜂−𝟣hDt − 𝟣)𝜓𝛾e i(mh)−𝟣tB𝜓𝛾|t=T‖ ≤ CT −𝟣𝛾 + Ch𝛿′

𝟢 ([−𝟣, 𝟣]), 𝜓𝛾(x) = 𝜓(x/𝛾) and 𝜑 ∈ C ∞

(4.3)
Proof. Observe first that if for u supported in ℝ+ and L = x𝟣hD𝟣− ih/𝟤 = L*

𝟢 ([−𝟣, 𝟣]),

.

(4.4)

𝖱𝖾 i(BLu, u) =

𝟣
𝟤

(i[B, L]u, u)

5

and then

(4.5)

𝖱𝖾(Lu, ut − ih−𝟣Bu) =

(ih−𝟣[B, L]u, u) +

𝟣
𝟤

𝟣
𝟤

𝜕t 𝖱𝖾(Lu, u)

and
(4.6) 𝖱𝖾(ktu + Lu, ut − ih−𝟣Bu) =

𝟣
𝟤

𝜕t

Let us plug

(︀kt‖u‖𝟤 + (Lu, u))︀ +

(︀(ih−𝟣[B, L]u, u) − k‖u‖𝟤)︀.

𝟣
𝟤

(4.7)
with ‖v‖ = 𝟣. Then the left hand expression in (4.6) is 𝟢 and

u = 𝜑(𝜂−𝟣hDt − 𝟣)e ih−𝟣TB𝜓𝛾v

(︀kt‖u‖𝟤 + (Lu, u))︀ ≤ 𝟣

(︀−(ih−𝟣[B, L]u, u) + k‖u‖𝟤)︀.

(4.8)

𝟣
𝟤

𝜕t

𝟤

Let us estimate from above the right-hand expression; obviously

(4.9)

ih−𝟣[Bm, L] = m(Bm − a𝟤Bm−𝟤).

(a) Assume first that m > 𝟤. Then since

(4.10)

(𝟣 − C 𝜂)‖u‖ ≤ ‖Bmu‖ ≤ (𝟣 + C 𝜂)‖u‖

due to cutoff by 𝜑 and

(4.11)
in virtue of Corollary 6.2 we conclude that as k = m(𝟣 − a𝟤) the right-hand
expression does not exceed C 𝜂 and therefore

m

Bm−𝟤 ≤ B (m−𝟤)/m

(4.12)

m(𝟣 − a𝟤)t‖u‖𝟤 + (Lu, u) ≤ C 𝛾 + C 𝜂T

since the value of the left-hand expression as t = 𝟢 does not exceed C 𝛾.

On the other hand, observe that on the energy levels from (𝟣−C𝟢𝜂, 𝟣+C𝟢𝜂)
the singularities propagate with a speed (with respect to x𝟣) not exceed-
ing m(𝟣 − a𝟤) 𝟣
𝟤 (𝟣 + C𝟢𝜂). Therefore we conclude that u is negligible as
|x𝟣| ≥ m(𝟣 − a𝟤) 𝟣

𝟤 (𝟣 + C𝟢𝜂)T + C 𝛾 and therefore since

(4.13)

‖D𝟣u‖ ≤ (B𝟤u, u) ≤ ((𝟣 − a𝟤)

𝟣

𝟤 + C𝟢𝜂)

6

we conclude using (4.10) and (4.11) that

|(Lu, u)| ≤ m(𝟣 − a𝟤 + C𝟢𝜂)T + C 𝛾 − 𝜖𝟢T‖𝜓𝛾(x𝟣)u‖𝟤

(4.14)
and the left-hand expression of (4.12) is greater than 𝜖𝟢T‖𝜓𝛾u‖𝟤− C (𝜂T + 𝛾)
and we arrive to (4.3).

(b) Assume now that 𝟢 < m < 𝟤. Then our above proof fails short in both
estimating 𝖱𝖾 ih−𝟣([B, L]u, u) from below and |(Lu, u)| from above and we
need to remedy it.

First, away from x𝟣 = 𝟢 only symbols are important and therefore the
𝟤 (am − a𝟤)‖𝜓𝜎u‖𝟤 + Ch𝟤𝜎−𝟤
right-hand expression of (4.8) does not exceed m
since ‖Bm−𝟤‖ ≤ am−𝟤. Indeed, we need just to decompose 𝟣 = 𝜓𝟤
𝜎 and
use our standard arguments to rewrite the right-hand expression of (4.8) as
the sum of the same expressions for 𝜓𝜎u and 𝜓′

𝜎 + 𝜓′ 𝟤
𝜎u plus Ch𝟤𝜎−𝟤‖u‖𝟤‖.

Similarly we deal 𝖱𝖾(Lu, u) = 𝖱𝖾(L𝜓𝜎u, 𝜓𝜎u) + 𝖱𝖾(L𝜓′

𝜎u, 𝜓′
absolute value of the second term does not exceed m(𝟣 − a𝟤) 𝟣

𝜎u) and the
𝜎‖𝟤.
𝟤 T‖B 𝟣/m

m 𝜓′

We claim that

(4.15)

𝖱𝖾(L𝜓𝜎u, 𝜓𝜎u) ≤ C 𝜎‖𝜓𝜎u‖𝟤 + C 𝜎h𝛿;

we prove it late but now instead of (4.12) we arrive as 𝜎 = 𝜖𝟢t to

∫︁ T

((𝟣 − a𝟤) − 𝜖)P(T ) ≤ Ch𝛿′

+ (am − a𝟤)T −𝟣

P(t) dt + C 𝛾T −𝟣

with P(t) = ‖𝜓𝜖𝟢tu(., t)‖𝟤. Then since 𝜈 = (am − a𝟤)/((𝟣 − a𝟤) − 𝜖) < 𝟢
which implies (4.3) again.

𝛾

Proof of (4.15). Indeed, as h = 𝟣, ‖B 𝟣/m
conclude that |u(x𝟣)| ≤ Cx (m−𝟣)/𝟤
‖uB 𝟣/m
therefore |(Lu, u)| ≤ C 𝜎m‖B 𝟣/m

m u‖𝟤. Take 𝜎 = 𝟣.

𝟣

m u‖ ≤ 𝟣 we from G. Grubb [G1, G2]
m u‖ and |Lu(x𝟣)| ≤ Cx (m−𝟣)/𝟤
and

𝟣

Scaling returns (4.15) as 𝜎 = h.

Proposition 4.3. Let 𝝠 = 𝝠m,X be a d-dimensional operator (1.1) on the
half-space X = {x ∈ ℝd , x𝟣 > 𝟢} with Euclidean metrics (d ≥ 𝟤) and
A = hm𝝠m − 𝟣.

7

Let 𝜓 ∈ C ∞

𝟢 ([−𝟣, 𝟣]), 𝜙 ∈ C ∞

𝟢 ([−𝟣, 𝟣]), 𝜓𝛾(x) = 𝜓(x𝟣/𝛾), 𝜑 ∈ C ∞

𝟢 (ℝd−𝟣)
supported in {|𝜉′| ≤ 𝟣 − 𝜖} with 𝜖 > 𝟢. Finally, let 𝛾 ≥ h𝟣−𝛿, T ≥ Ch−𝛿𝛾,
h𝛿 ≥ 𝜂 ≥ h𝟣−𝛿T −𝟣. Then

(4.16)

‖𝜑(𝜂−𝟣hDt)𝜙(hD′)𝜓𝛾(x𝟣)e ih−𝟣tA𝜓|t=T‖ = O(hs)

with arbitrarily large s.

Proof. By making Fourier transform Fx′→h−𝟣𝜉′ we reduce the general case to
d = 𝟣 and operator B.
According to Proposition 4.2 ‖𝜑(𝜂−𝟣hDt)𝜓𝛾e ih−𝟣TA𝜓‖ ≤ h𝛿. Thus for
s = 𝛿′ (4.16) has been proven (we reduce 𝛿′ if necessary).
Without any loss of the generality we assume that 𝜓(x𝟣) = 𝟣 as x𝟣 ≤ 𝟣,
𝜓(x𝟣) = 𝟢 as x𝟣 ≥ 𝟤.
Observe that due to propagation as t ≤ T and x𝟣 ≥ 𝛾 we see that
𝜑(𝜂−𝟣hDt)Q +(hD𝟣)(𝟣 − 𝜓𝛾)e ih−𝟣TA𝜓𝛾 is negligible where Q± ∈ C ∞(ℝ) is
supported in {±𝜉𝟣 > 𝜖}.
Furthermore, from the standard ellipticity arguments we conclude that
𝟢 ([−𝟤𝜖, 𝟤𝜖]).
𝜑(𝜂−𝟣hDt)Q 𝟢(hD𝟣)(𝟣−𝜓𝛾)e ih−𝟣TA𝜓𝛾 is also negligible for Q 𝟢 ∈ C ∞
Finally, due to propagation as t ≥ T and x𝟣 ≥ 𝛾 we conclude that
𝜑(𝜂−𝟣hDt)𝜓𝛾e ih−𝟣(t−T )AQ−(hD𝟣)(𝟣 − 𝜓𝛾)e ih−𝟣TA𝜓𝛾 is negligible as t ≥ T .
What is left is 𝜑(𝜂−𝟣hDt)𝜓𝛾e ih−𝟣(t−T )AQ−(hD𝟣)𝜓𝛾e ih−𝟣TA𝜓𝛾 and since
(4.16) holds for s = 𝛿′ we conclude that it holds for s = 𝟤𝛿′ and T replaced
by 𝟤T .

Continuing this process we see that (4.16) holds for s = n𝛿′ and T
replaced by nT . Therefore, as we redenote nT by T (and T by T /n
respectively), we acquire factor (𝛾n/T )n in our estimate and it is O(hs) for
any s as h is sufficiently small, 𝛾/T ≤ h𝛿 and n = s/𝛿′.

4.2 General case

Theorem 4.4. Let (̄x, ̄𝜉) be a point on the energy level 𝟣. Consider a
Hamiltonian trajectory 𝝭t(̄x, ̄𝜉) with ±t ∈ [𝟢, mT ] (one sign only) with
T ≥ 𝜖𝟢 and assume that for each t indicated it meets 𝜕X transversally i.e.
(4.17) 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍(πx 𝝭t(x, 𝜉), 𝜕X ) ≤ 𝜖 =⇒

𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍(πx 𝝭t(x, 𝜉), 𝜕X )| ≥ 𝜖

∀t : ±t ∈ [𝟢, mT ].

|d
dt

8

Also assume that

(4.18)

𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍(πx 𝝭t(x, 𝜉), 𝜕X ) ≥ 𝜖𝟢

as t = 𝟢, ±t = mT .

Let 𝜖 > 𝟢 be a small enough constant, Q be supported in 𝜖-vicinity of
(x, 𝜉) and Q𝟣 ≡ 𝟣 in C𝟢𝜖-vicinity of 𝝭t(x, 𝜉) as t = ±mT . Then operator
(I − Q𝟣)e−ih−𝟣tHQ is negligible as t = ±mT .

Proof. (a) Obviously without any loss of the generality one can assume that
there is just one reflection from 𝜕X (and this reflection is transversal) and
that (3.1) is fulfilled in its vicinity.

Further, without any loss of the generality one can assume that Q is
supported in 𝜀-vicinity of (̄x, ̄𝜉), Q𝟣 ≡ 𝟣 in 𝜀-vicinity of 𝝭mT (̄x, ̄𝜉) and T ≍ 𝜀
. Then both ̄x and πx 𝝭mT (̄x, ̄𝜉) belong to C𝟢𝜀-vicinity of 𝜕X .
with 𝜀 = h 𝟣

𝟤−𝛿′

Indeed, it follows from the propagation inside of domain.

(b) Then instead of isotropic vicinities we can consider anisotropic ones: 𝜀
with respect to (x′, 𝜉′), h𝟣−𝟥𝛿′
with respect to 𝜉𝟣.
Let now Q and Q𝟣 be corresponding operators.

with respect to x𝟣 and h𝛿′

In this framework from the propagation inside of domain it follows that
and

without any loss of the generality one can assume that T ≍ 𝛾 = h𝟣−𝛿′′
both ̄x and πx 𝝭mT (̄x, ̄𝜉) belong to C𝟢𝛾-vicinity of 𝜕X .

(c) Then one can employ the method of the successive approximations
freezing coefficients at point ̄x and in this case the statement of the theorem
follows from the construction of Section 7.2 of [Ivr]2) and Proposition 4.3.
We leave easy details to the reader.

Then we arrive immediately to

Corollary 4.5. Under standard non-periodicity condition 𝖭−(h) is given
with o(h𝟣−d )-error by the Tauberian expression with T = h𝟣−𝛿.

Proof. Easy details are left to the reader.

2) Insignificant and rather obvious modifications are required.

5 Main results

5.1 From Tauberian to Weyl asymptotics

Now we can apply the method of successive approximations as described in
Section 7.2 2) and prove that for operator A the Tauberian expression with
T = h𝟣−𝛿 (with sufficiently small 𝛿 > 𝟢) equals to Weyl expression 𝖭𝖶
h with
O(h𝟤−d−𝛿′′

) error,

(5.1)
with the standard coefficient 𝜅𝟢 = (𝟤𝜋)−d 𝜛d 𝗏𝗈𝗅d (X ) and with

h = 𝜅𝟢h−d + 𝜅𝟣,mh𝟣−d + o(h𝟣−m)

jector of operator 𝗮m := Bm,𝟣,𝟣 introduced by (4.1):

(5.4)

𝗮m = ((D 𝟤

x + 𝟣)m/𝟤)𝖣

Recall that 𝗏𝗈𝗅d and 𝗏𝗈𝗅d−𝟣 are Riemannian volumes corresponding to
metrics g and its restriction to 𝜕X respectively and 𝜋−𝟣(𝜆 − 𝟣)𝟣/m is a Weyl
approximation to 𝗲m,𝟣(x𝟣, x𝟣, 𝜆).

Thus we arrive to

Theorem 5.1. Under standard non-periodicity condition the following asymp-
totics holds:

as h → +𝟢

which immediately implies (5.5) .

5.2 Discussion

The following problems seem to be challenging

Problem 5.2. As m𝟣 > 𝟢, m𝟤 > 𝟢 consider

(5.7)

K = Km𝟣,m𝟤,X := 𝝠m,X − 𝝠m𝟣,X 𝝠m𝟤,X

on D(𝝠m) with m = m𝟣 + m𝟤. From Corollary 6.2 we conclude that this is
non-negative operator; obviously singularities of its Schwartz kernel K (x, y )
belong to 𝜕X × 𝜕X . Prove that

(i) K a positive operator.
(ii) As X = {x ∈ ℝd : x𝟣 > 𝟢} with Euclidean metrics its Schwartz kernel
K (x, y ) = k(x𝟣, y𝟣, x′ − y′) which is positive homogeneous of degree −m − d
satisfies

x D 𝛽

|D 𝛼

y K (x, y )| ≤ C𝛼𝛽(x𝟣 + y𝟣)−m−𝛼𝟣−𝛽𝟣(x𝟣 + y𝟣 + |z|)−d−|𝛼′|+|𝛽′|.

(5.8)
(iii) In the general case in the local coordinates in which X = {x : x𝟣 > 𝟢}
and x𝟣 = 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍(x, 𝜕X ) not only (5.8) holds but also

(︀K (x, y ) − K 𝟢(x, y ))︀|

(5.9)

|D 𝛼

x D 𝛽
y

≤ C𝛼𝛽(x𝟣 + y𝟣)−m−𝛼𝟣−𝛽𝟣(x𝟣 + y𝟣 + |z|)−d−|𝛼′|+|𝛽′|+𝟣

where K 𝟢(x, y ) = k(x𝟣, y𝟣, x′ − y′) and g jk = δjk at point (𝟢, 𝟣

𝟤(x′ + y′).

Problem 5.3. As m > 𝟢, n > 𝟢 consider operator
K = Km,n,X := 𝝠m,X − 𝝠m/n

(5.10)

n,X

on D(𝝠k) with k = 𝗆𝖺𝗑(m, n). Then this is non-negative (no-positive)
operator as m > n (m < n respectively). Prove that

(i) K a positive (negative) operator as n > m (n < m respectively).
(ii) As X = {x ∈ ℝd : x𝟣 > 𝟢} with Euclidean metrics its Schwartz kernel
K (x, y ) = k(x𝟣, y𝟣, x′ − y′) which is positive homogeneous of degree −m − d
satisfies (5.8).

11

(iii) In the framework of Problem 5.2(iii) both (5.8) and (5.9) hold.

Problem 5.4. (i) Consider operators (𝝙m/𝟤)𝖣 with m < 𝟢 and the asymp-
totics of eigenvalues tending to +𝟢.

(ii) Consider operators with degenerations like Am,X = hm𝝠m,X + V (x).

(iii) Consider more general operators where instead of 𝝙 general elliptic
(matrix) operator is used.

Problem 5.5. (i) Consider Neumann boundary conditions: having smooth
metrics g in the vicinity of ̄X for each point x /∈ X in the vicinity of 𝜕X
we can assign a mirror point j(x) ∈ ̄X such that x and j(x) are connected
by a (short) geodesics orthogonal to Y at the point of intersection. Each u
defined in X we can continue to the vicinity of ̄X as Ju(x) = 𝜓(x)u(j(x))
with 𝜓 supported in the vicinity of ̄X and 𝜓 = 𝟣 in the smaller vicinity of
̄X . Then 𝝠mu = RX 𝝙m/𝟤Ju.

- Establish eigenvalue asymptotics for this operator.

- Surely we need to prove that the choice neither of metrics outside of X

nor 𝜓 is important.

(ii) One can also try Ju(x) = −𝜓(x)u(j(x)) and prove that eigenvalue asymp-
totics for this operator do not differ from what we got just for continuation
by 𝟢.

Problem 5.6. Consider manifolds with all geodesic billiards closed as in
Section 8.3 of [Ivr]. To do this we need to calculate the “phase shift” at
the transversal reflection point itself seems to be an extremely challenging
problem.

6.A Variational estimates for fractional

Laplacian

We follow here R. Frank and L. Geisinger [FG]. This is Lemma 19 and the
next paragraph of their paper:

12

Lemma 6.1. (i) Let B be a non-negative operator with 𝖪𝖾𝗋 B = {𝟢} and
let P be an orthogonal projection. Then for any operator monotone function
𝜑 : (𝟢,∞) → ℝ,

(6.1)

P𝜑(PBP)P ≥ P𝜑(B)P.

(ii) If, in addition, B is positive definite and 𝜑 is not affine linear, then
𝜑(PBP) = P𝜑(B)P implies that the range of P is a reducing subspace of B.

We recall that, by definition, the range of P is a reducing subspace of a
non-negative (possibly unbounded) operator if (B + 𝜏 )−𝟣 𝖱𝖺𝗇 P ⊂ 𝖱𝖺𝗇 P for
some 𝜏 > 𝟢. We note that this is equivalent to (B + 𝜏 )−𝟣 commuting with
P, and we see that the definition is independent of 𝜏 since
(B + 𝜏′)−𝟣P − P(B + 𝜏′)−𝟣

= (B + 𝜏 )(B + 𝜏′)−𝟣(︀(B + 𝜏 )−𝟣P − P(B + 𝜏 )−𝟣)︀ (B + 𝜏 )(B + 𝜏′)−𝟣.

We refer to the proof given there.

Corollary 6.2. The following inequality holds

(6.2)

𝝠m,X ≤ 𝝠m/n

n,X

as 𝟢 < m < n.

Proof. Plugging into (6.1) B = 𝝙n/𝟤 in ℝd , P = 𝜃X (x) and 𝜑(𝜆) = 𝜆m/n we
get (6.2).

Repeating arguments of Proposition 20 and following it Subsection 6.4
of R. Frank and L. Geisinger [FG] (powers of operators will be different but
also negative) we conclude that
Proposition 6.3. Let d ≥ 𝟤. Then −𝜘m is positive strictly monotone
increasing function of m > 𝟢.

We leave details to the reader.

6.B 𝜇-transmission property

Proposition 1 of G. Grubb [G2] claims that
Proposition 6.4. A necessary and sufficient condition in order that RX Pu ∈
C ∞( ̄X ) for all u ∈ E𝜇( ̄X ) is that P satisfies the 𝜇-transmission condition
(in short: is of type 𝜇), namely that

(6.3)

𝜉 pj (x,−N) = e 𝜋i(m−𝟤𝜇−j−|𝛼|)𝜕𝛽

x 𝜕𝛼
𝜕𝛽

x 𝜕𝛼

𝜉 pj (x, N)

∀x ∈ 𝜕𝝮,

for all j, 𝛼, 𝛽, where N denotes the interior normal to 𝜕X at x, m is an order
of classical pseudo-differential operator P and for 𝜇 ∈ ℂ with 𝖱𝖾 𝜇 > −𝟣.
Here E𝜇( ̄X ) denotes the space of functions u such that u = EX d(x)𝜇v
with v ∈ C ∞( ̄X ) where EX is an operator of extension by 𝟢 to ℝd ∖ X and
d(x) = 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍(x, 𝜕X ).

Observe that for 𝜇 = 𝟢 we have an ordinary transmission property (see

Definition 1.4.3).

7 Global theory
Let us discuss fractional Laplacians defined by (1.1) in domain X ⊂ ℝd .
Then under additional condition

(7.1)

𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍(x, y ) ≤ C𝟢|x − y|

∀x, y ∈ X

(where 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍(x, y ) is a “connected” distance between x and y ) everything
seems to work. We leave to the reader.

Problem 7.1. Under assumption (11.3.54) of [Ivr]

(i) prove Lieb-Cwikel-Rozeblioum estimate (9.A.11) of [Ivr].

(ii) Restore results of Chapter 9 of [Ivr].

(iii) Reconsider examples of Sections 11.2 and 11.3 of [Ivr].

Remark 7.2. Obviously domains with cuts and inner spikes (inner angles of
𝟤𝜋) do not fit (7.1). On the other hand in the case of the domain with the
cut due to non-locality of 𝝙r with r ∈ ℝ+ ∖ ℤ both sides of the cut “interact”
and at least coefficient in the second term of two-term asymptotics may be
wrong; in the case of the inner spike some milder effects are expected.

(b)

Figure 1: Domain with a cut (a) and an inner spike (b).

The following problem seems to be very challenging:

Problem 7.3. (i) Investigate fractional Laplacians in domains with cuts
and inner spikes and save whatever is possible.

(ii) Generalize these results to higher dimensions.

Comments

To my surprise I learned that fractional Laplacians are of the interest
to probability theory: which seem to be of interest to probability theory
starting from R. M. Blumenthal, R. M. and R. K. Getoor [BG] and then
by R. Ban˜uelos and T. Kulczycki [BK], R. Ban˜uelos, T. Kulczycki and
B. Siudeja. [BKS], M. Kwas´nicki [K].

Those operators were formulated in the framework of stochastic processes
and thus were not accessible for me until I found paper R. Frank and
L. Geisinger [FG] provided definition we follow here. They showed that
the trace has a two-term expansion regardless of dynamical assumptions3),
and the second term in their expansion paper [FG] defined by (3.2)–(3.3) is
closely related to 𝜅𝟣,m.

Furthermore I learned that one-term asymptotics for more general oper-
ators (albeit without remainder estimate) was obtained by G. Grubb [G3].

3) The fact that R. Frank and L. Geisinger obtain a second term regardless of dynamical
assumptions is simply due to the fact that they study 𝖳𝗋(f (𝝠m,X )) with f (𝜆) = −𝜆θ(−𝜆),
which is one order smoother than f (𝜆) = θ(−𝜆).

I express my gratitudes to G. Grubb and R. Frank for pointing to
rather nasty errors in the previous version and very useful comments and
R. Ban˜uelos for very useful comments.
