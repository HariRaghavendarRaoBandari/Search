ON THE GROWTH RATES OF COFINITE 3-DIMENSIONAL
COXETER GROUPS SOME OF WHOSE DIHEDRAL ANGLES

ARE π

m FOR m ≥ 7

TOMOSHIGE YUKITA

Abstract. We studied the growth rates of coﬁnite 3-dimensional hyperbolic Cox-
eter groups whose dihedral angles are of the form π
m for m = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and
showed the growth rates are always Perron numbers in the paper [20]. In this
paper, we consider the growth rates of coﬁnite 3-dimensional hyperbolic Coxeter
groups some of whose dihedral angles are π
m for m ≥ 7 and prove that their growth
rates are always Perron numbers. Moreover, by combining with the result in [20],
we conclude that the growth rates of coﬁnite 3-dimensional hyperbolic Coxeter
groups are always Perron numbers in general.

1. Introduction

n

n

Let Hn denote the upper half-space model of hyperbolic n-space and H

its closure
in Rn ∪ {∞}. A convex polyhedron P ⊂ H
of ﬁnite volume is called a Coxeter
polyhedron if all of whose dihedral angles are of the form π
m for an integer m ≥ 2
or m = ∞. The set S of reﬂections with respect to facets of P generates the
discrete group Γ, called the hyperbolic Coxeter group, and the pair (Γ, S) is called
the Coxeter system associated to P . Then P becomes a fundamental domain of
Γ. If P is compact (resp. non-compact), the hyperbolic Coxeter group Γ is called
cocompact (resp. coﬁnite). The growth series fS(t) of (Γ, S) is the formal power
series P∞
k=0 aktk where ak is the number of elements of Γ whose word lengths with
k√ak is called the growth rate
respect to S are equal to k. Then τΓ := lim supk→∞
of (Γ, S). By means of Cauchy-Hadamard formula, τΓ is equal to the reciprocal of
the radius of convergence R of fS(t). It is known that the growth rate τΓ is a real
algebraic integer bigger than 1 ([5]). In the paper [20], we showed that the growth
rates of non-compact hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedra whose dihedral angles are of
the form π
m for m = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are always Perron numbers, where a real algebraic
integer τ > 1 is called a Perron number if all its algebraic conjugates are less than τ
in absolute value. In general, non-compact hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedron has some
dihedral angles π
m where m ≥ 7, so that we consider the growth rates of non-compact
hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedra some of whose dihedral angles are π
m for m ≥ 7 and
prove the following theorem in this paper.

Theorem. Suppose that P is a non-compact hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedron some
of whose dihedral angles are π
m for m ≥ 7. Then the growth rate of P is a Perron
number. Moreover, by combining with the result in [20], the growth rates of coﬁnite
3-dimensional hyperbolic Coxeter groups are always Perron numbers.

Note that Kellerhals and Perren conjectured that the growth rates of cocompact

hyperbolic Coxeter groups are always Perron numbers ([8]).

The organization of the present paper is as follows. In section 2, we review some
useful formula in the paper [20] to calculate the growth function fS(t). Then, we
calculate the growth function fS(t) of a non-compact hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedron
some of whose dihedral angles are π

m for m ≥ 7 in section 3.

2. Preliminaries

In this section, we introduce some notations and review useful identities in [20]

to calculate the growth functions of hyperbolic Coxeter groups.

Deﬁnition 1. (Coxeter system, Coxeter graph, growth rate)

(i) A Coxeter system (W, S) consists of a group W and a set of generators S ⊂ W
with relations (sisj)mij for each i, j , where mii = 1 and mij ≥ 2 or mij = ∞ for
i 6= j. We call W a Coxeter group. For any subset I ⊂ S, we deﬁne WI to be the
subgroup of W generated by I. WI is called the Coxeter subgroup of W .

(ii) The Coxeter graph of (W, S) is constructed as follows:

the vertex set is S. If mij ≥ 3 (si 6= sj ∈ S), join the pair of vertices by an edge and
label such an edge with mij. If mij = ∞ (si 6= sj ∈ S), join the pair of vertices by
an bold edge.
k=0 aktk where
ak is the number of elements of W whose word lengths with respect to S are equal
to k. Then τ = lim supk→∞

(iii) The growth series fS(t) of (W, S) is the formal power series P∞

k√ak is called the growth rate of (W, S).

A Coxeter group W is irreducible if the Coxeter graph of (W, S) is connceted. In
this paper, we are interested in Coxeter groups which acts hyperbolic n-space as a
discrete group.

Deﬁnition 2. (hyperbolic polyhedron)

n

A subset P ⊂ H

is called a hyperbolic polyhedron if P can be written as the
intersection of ﬁnitely many closed half spaces: P = ∩HS where HS is the closed
domain of Hn bounded by hyperplane S.

Suppose that S ∩ T 6= ∅ in Hn. Then we deﬁne the dihedral angle between S and
T as follows: let us choose a point x ∈ S ∩ T and consider the outer-normal vectors
eS, eT ∈ Rn of S and T with respect to P starting from x. Then the dihedral angle
between S and T is deﬁned by the real number θ ∈ [0, π) satisfying cos θ = −(eS, eT )
where (·,·) denote the Euclidean inner product of Rn.
is a point at ideal boundary of Hn, we deﬁne
the dihedral angle between S and T is equal to zero.

is of ﬁnite volume if and only if
is a hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedron,

3

the set S of reﬂections with respect to facets of P generates the discrete group Γ.
We call Γ the n-dimensional hyperbolic Coxeter group associated to P . Moreover, if
P is compact (resp. non-compact), Γ is called cocompact (resp. coﬁnite).

We recall Solomon’s formula and Steinberg’s formula which are very useful for

calculating the growth series.

Theorem 1. (Solomon’s formula)[18]
The growth series fS(t) of an irreducible ﬁnite Coxeter group (Γ, S) can be written as
fS(t) = [m1 + 1, m2 + 1,··· , mk + 1] where [n] = 1+ t +···+ tn−1, [m, n] = [m][n],etc.
and {m1, m2,··· , mk} is the set of exponents of (Γ, S).

The table 1 shows the exponents of irreducible ﬁnite Coxeter groups (see [7] for

details).

Theorem 2. (Steinberg’s formula)[19]
Let (Γ, S) be a hyperbolic Coxeter group. Let us denote the Coxeter subgroup of
(Γ, S) generated by the subset T ⊆ S by (ΓT , T ), and denote its growth function by

that p(t)
q(t) is called
the growth function. The radius of convergence R of the growth series fS(t) is equal
to the real positive root of q(t) which has the smallest absolute value of all roots of

angle between Fi and Fi+1. Then, by lemma 1 and corollary 1 in [20], the number

We use these identities and inequality to calculate the growth functions of coﬁnite
3-dimensional hyperbolic Coxeter groups. Then, by using the following proposition,
we show that the growth rates of coﬁnite 3-dimensional hyperbolic Coxeter groups
are Perron numbers.

Proposition 1. ([10], Lemma1)
Consider the following polynomial of degree n ≥ 2
aktk − 1,

g(t) =

X

n

k=1

where ak is a non-negative integer. We also assume that the greatest common divisor
of {k ∈ N | ak 6= 0} is 1. Then there is a real number r0, 0 < r0 < 1 which is the
unique zero of g(t) having the smallest absolute value of all zeros of g(t).

Here, we review how we proved that the growth rate of non-compact 3-dimensional
hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedron P is a Perron number ([20]). First, we calculate the

5

growth function fS(t) of P by means of Steinberg’s formula. Second, by using the
identities (3)∼(12) and the inequality (13), we proved that all of the coeﬃcients of
the denominator polynomial of fS(t) except its constant term are non-negative. This
observation is key point to prove that the growth rates of non-compact hyperbolic
Coxeter polyhedra some of whose dihedral angles are π
m for n ≥ 7 are always Perron
numbers. Finally, by applying proposition 1 to the denominator polynomial of fS(t),
we conclude that the growth rate of P is a Perron number.

3. non-compact Coxeter polyhedra some of whose dihedral angles

are π

m for m ≥ 7

In this section, we calculate the growth function fS(t) of a non-compact hyperbolic
m for m ≥ 7 and prove

Coxeter polyhedron P some of whose dihedral angles are π
the growth rate of P is a Perron number.

Theorem 3. Let the sum of the numbers of the π

m -edges for m ≥ 7 be k, that is,

k = X

m≥7

em

Then we obtain the following inequality.

k ≤ F − 3

Moreover, if P satisﬁes the identity k = F −3, P has a unique cusp of type (2, 2, 2, 2)
and the other vertices are type of (2, 2, mi) (mi ≥ 7).

To show the above theorem 3, we introduce the following deformation of Coxeter

polyhedra.

Theorem 4. ([9], Proposition 1 and 2.)

(i) Suppose that a hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedron P has some π

m -edges for m ≥ 7.
m -edges can be contracted to cusps of type (2, 2, 2, 2). The hyperbolic
m -edges of P

Then all of the π
Coxeter polyhedron ˆP which is obtained from P by contracting some π
is called the pinched Coxeter polyhedron of P .

(ii) If a hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedron P has some cusps of type (2, 2, 2, 2),
then there exists Coxeter polyhedron which is obtained by opening cusps of type
(2, 2, 2, 2). (see Fig 1)

Proof of Theorem 3. Suppose that P is a non-compact hyperbolic Coxeter poly-
m -edges of P is k. The inequalities (3),

hedron and the sum of the numbers of the π
(4) and (5) imply that

(the number of vertices of P with valency 3)

(the number of vertices of ˆP with valency 3).

Since ˆP is the pinched Coxeter polyhedron of P , F = ˆF and ˆv2,2,2,2 = v2,2,2,2 + k.
Then the equality (15) implies that

(16)

1
2
By the equality (16), we see that

F − 2 = v2,2,2,2 + k +

(the number of vertices of ˆP with valency 3).

k ≤ F − 2.

Moreover, if P satisﬁes the identity k = F − 2, all of the vertices of ˆP are cusps
of type (2, 2, 2, 2). This observation means that all of the vertices of P are type of
(2, 2, m), where m ≥ 7. Therefore, the fact that P satisﬁes the identity k = F − 2
contradicts to the assumption of non-compactness of P . Consequently, we obtain
the following inequality.

k ≤ F − 3.

Suppose that k = F − 3. Since P is non-compact, P has at least one cusp. Then
if P has a cusp of type (2, 3, 6) or (2, 4, 4) or (3, 3, 3), ˆP also has a cusp of type
(2, 3, 6) or (2, 4, 4) or (3, 3, 3). By the fact that a π
m -edge (m ≥ 3) is adjacent to two
vertices with valency 3, we can see that ˆP has at least three vertices with valency 3.

Therefore, by the equality (16), we obtain the following inequality.

F − 2 = v2,2,2,2 + k +

(the number of vertices of ˆP with valency 3)

Hence if P has a cusp of type (2, 3, 6) or (2, 4, 4) or (3, 3, 3), we obtain a contradiction.
This fact implies that if k = F − 3, P has a unique cusp of type (2, 2, 2, 2) and the
other vertices of P are type of (2, 2, m) where m ≥ 7.

3.1. The growth rates for the case of k = F − 3. By theorem 3, if P satisﬁes
that the identity k = F − 3, we can assume that P has a unique cusp of type
(2, 2, 2, 2) and the other vertices are type (2, 2, m), where m ≥ 7. Suppose ˜P is
the polyhedron obtained by opening all of cusps of type (2, 2, 2, 2) of P . Then ˜P is
a compact Coxeter polyhedron, therefore we can apply the following theorem 5 to
conclude that the growth rate of P is a Perron number.

Theorem 5. ([9], Theorem 5.) Suppose ˜P is a compact Coxeter polyhedron all
of whose vertices are type of (2, 2, m) where m ≥ 7 and P is the pinched Coxeter
polyhedron of ˜P which has a unique cusp of type (2, 2, 2, 2) and the other vertices
are type (2, 2, m), where m ≥ 7.
Then, the growth rate of P is a Pisot number.

6 ,and fP (t), fP ′(t)
are the growth functions of P and P ′, respectively (see Fig 2). Note that a “non-
compact Coxeter polyhedron” P ′ is not necessarily realized in hyperbolic 3-space as
a hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedron. By means of Steinberg’s formula, we obtain the

The above equality means that the coeﬃcients of Q1(t) except its constant term

Therefore the coeﬃcients of Qk(t) except its constant term are non-negative if P
satisﬁes the inequality F − 4 ≥ k, and hence the growth rate is a Perron number. (cid:3)

3.3. The growth rates for the case of F = 5, 6 and F − 4 ≥ k. In proposition 2,
the inequality (18) is necessary to show the growth rate of P is a Perron number for
the case of F − 4 ≥ k. For this reason, we consider when the non-compact Coxeter
polyhedron P with 5 or 6-facets does not satisfy the inequality (18). The ﬁgure 3
shows the combinatorial structures of convex polyhedra with 4, 5, 6-facets.

We use the following lemma to show when the non-compact hyperbolic Coxeter

polyhedron P with 5 or 6-facets does not satisfy the inequality (18).

Lemma 1. [1] An acute-angled almost simple polyhedron of ﬁnite volume with
given dihedral angles, other than a tetrahedron or a triangular prism, exists in H3
if and only if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(a) if three facets meet at a vertex, then the sum of the dihedral angles between

them is greater than π;

(b) if three facets meet at a cusp, then the sum of the dihedral angles between

them is equal to π;

(c) if four facets meet at a vertex or a cusp, then all the dihedral angles between

them equal π
2 ;

(d) if three faces are pairwise adjacent but share neither a vertex nor a cusp, then

the sum of the dihedral angles between them is less than π ;

(e) if a facet of Fi is adjacent to facets Fj and Fk, while Fj and Fk are not adjacent
but have a common cusp which Fi does not share, then at least one of the angles
formed by Fi with Fj and with Fk is diﬀerent from π
2 ;

(f) if four facets are cyclically adjacent but meet at neither a vertex nor a cusp,

then at least one of the dihedral angles between them is diﬀerent from π
2 .

A hyperbolic polyhedron in H3 is almost simple if any of its vertices not at inﬁnity
belongs only to three facets. Thus any hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedron is almost
simple.

By theorem 4 and lemma 1, if non-compact hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedra with
5 or 6-facets have π
m -edges for m ≥ 7, the combinatorial structures are (ii), (iv),
(v), (viii), (ix), (x). If the combinatorial structure of P is (viii), P has 2 cusps of
type (2, 2, 2, 2) and if the combinatorial structure is (ix) or (x), P has at least one
of cusps of type (2, 3, 6) or (2, 4, 4) or (3, 3, 3). Hence, the inequality (18) holds for
the combinatorial structure (viii), (iv), (x).

By theorem 4, we determine which edges can have the dihedral angles π

m for
m ≥ 7. The ﬁgure 4 shows the sequences of combinatorial structures obtained by
opening cusps of type (2, 2, 2, 2).

In the ﬁgure 4, labels on edges mean the dihedral angles and m, m1, m2 ≥ 7. If
the inequality (18) does not hold for the case of (iv) or (v), all of the dihedral angles

Proposition 3. Suppose that the combinatorial structure of P is (iv) or (v) and P
does not satisfy the inequality (18). Then the growth rate of P is a Perron number.

Let Q(t) := (2t + 1)[m1, m2] − (t + 1)([m1] + [m2]). We may assume that m1 ≥ m2,
without loss in generality.

If m1 = m2, Q(t) is rewrriten as,

= [m1](2tm2 + 3tm2−1 + ··· + 3t2 + t) + t(tm1−1 + ··· + tm2) − [m2]

By the above calculation, the coeﬃcients of Q(t) except its constant term are

non-negative.

Therefore we can apply proposition 1 to conclude that the growth rate is a Perron
(cid:3)

number.

For any non-compact Coxeter triangular prism one of whose dihedral angles are
m for m ≥ 7, there exists a unique Coxeter pyramid which has some cusps other
than the apex. Therefore, by lemme 2 we can determine when Coxeter triangular
prisms do not satisfy the condition (18).

Corollary 1. Suppose that P is a Coxeter triangular prism and P does not satisfy
the inequality (18). Then P has the dihedral angles as in ﬁgure 6 and the growth
rate of P is a Perron number.

Proof. Case.(I) By means of Steinberg’s formula, we can calculate the growth func-
tion fP (t), and hence the growth function is written as,

1

fP (t)

=

(t − 1)(2tm+2 + 3tm+1 + 4tm + ··· + 4t4 + 3t3 + t2 − 1)

[2, 2, 4, m]

Case.(II) The growth function is calculated in the same manner, and hence the

growth function is written as,

1

fP (t)

=

R(t)

[2, 2, 2, 3, 6, m]

where

R(t) = 2tm+8 + 5tm+7 + 7tm+6 + 7tm+5 + 6tm+4 + 5tm+3 + 3tm+2 + tm+1

−t9 − 4t8 − 7t7 − 8t6 − 7t5 − 6t4 − 4t3 − t2 + t + 1

R(t) is divided by [2,3] and (t − 1). Therefore fP (t) can be rewritten as,
1

(t − 1)(2tm+4 + 3tm+34tm+2 + 5tm+1 + 6tm + ··· + 6t6 + 5t5 + 3t4 + 2t3 + t2 − 1)

[2, 2, 6, m]

=

fP (t)

13

Hence, we can apply proposition 1 to conclude that the growth rate is a Perron
(cid:3)

number.

By combining the theorem 5, proposition 2, proposition 3 and corollary 1, we

obtain the following main theorem.

Theorem. Suppose that P is a non-compact hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedron. Then
the growth rate of P is a Perron number.
