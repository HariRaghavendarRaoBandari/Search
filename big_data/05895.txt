Asymptotics for Quasi-Stationary

Distributions of Perturbed Discrete Time

Semi-Markov Processes

Mikael Petersson∗

Abstract

In this paper, we study quasi-stationary distributions of nonlin-
early perturbed semi-Markov processes in discrete time. This type of
distributions is of interest for the analysis of stochastic systems which
have ﬁnite lifetimes, but are expected to persist for a long time. We
obtain asymptotic power series expansions for quasi-stationary distri-
butions and it is shown how the coeﬃcients in these expansions can
be computed from a recursive algorithm. As an illustration of this
algorithm, we present a numerical example for a discrete time Markov
chain.

Keywords: Semi-Markov process, Perturbation, Quasi-stationary distribu-
tion, Asymptotic expansion, Renewal equation, Markov chain.

Introduction

This paper is a sequel of Petersson (2016) where recursive algorithms for
computing asymptotic expansions of moment functionals for non-linearly
perturbed semi-Markov processes in discrete time where presented. Here,
these expansions play a fundamental role for constructing asymptotic expan-
sions of quasi-stationary distributions for such processes. Let us remark that
all notation, conditions, and key results which we need here are repeated.
However, some extensive formulas needed for computation of coeﬃcients in

certain asymptotic expansions are not repeated. Thus, the present paper is
essentially self-contained.

Quasi-stationary distributions are useful for studies of stochastic systems
with random lifetimes. Usually, for such systems, the evolution of some
quantity of interest is described by some stochastic process and the lifetime of
the system is the ﬁrst time this process hits some absorbing subset of the state
space. For such processes, the stationary distribution will be concentrated on
this absorbing subset. However, if we expect that the system will persist for
a long time, the stationary distribution may not be an appropriate measure
for describing the long time behaviour of the process. Instead, it might be
more relevant to consider so-called quasi-stationary distributions. This type
of distributions is obtained by taking limits of transition probabilities which
are conditioned on the event that the process has not yet been absorbed.

Models of the type described above arise in many areas of applications
such as epidemics, genetics, population dynamics, queuing theory, reliability,
and risk theory. For example, in population dynamics models the number of
individuals may be modelled by some stochastic process and we can consider
the extinction time of the population as the lifetime. In epidemic models,
the process may describe the evolution of the number of infected individuals
and we can regard the end of the epidemic as the lifetime.

We consider, for every ε ≥ 0, a discrete time semi-Markov process ξ(ε)(n),
n = 0, 1, . . . , on a ﬁnite state space X = {0, 1, . . . , N}. It is assumed that the
process ξ(ε)(n) depends on ε in such a way that its transition probabilities
are functions of ε which converge pointwise to the transition probabilities for
the limiting process ξ(0)(n). Thus, we can interpret ξ(ε)(n), for ε > 0, as a
perturbation of ξ(0)(n). Furthermore, it is assumed that the states {1, . . . , N}
is a communicating class for ε small enough.

Under conditions mentioned above, some additional assumptions of ﬁnite
exponential moments of distributions of transition times, and a condition
which guarantees that the limiting semi-Markov process is non-periodic, a
unique quasi-stationary distribution, independent of the initial state, can be
deﬁned for each suﬃciently small ε by the following relation,

π(ε)
j = lim
n→∞

Pi{ξ(ε)(n) = j | µ(ε)

0 > n}, i, j 6= 0,

where µ(ε)
0

is the ﬁrst hitting time of state 0.

In the present paper, we are interested in the asymptotic behaviour of the
quasi-stationary distribution as the perturbation parameter ε tends to zero.
Speciﬁcally, an asymptotic power series expansion of the quasi-stationary
distribution is constructed.

2

We allow for nonlinear perturbations, i.e., the transition probabilities
may be nonlinear functions of ε. We do, however, restrict our consideration
to smooth perturbations by assuming that certain mixed power-exponential
moment functionals for transition probabilities, up to some order k, can be
expanded in asymptotic power series with respect to ε.

In this case, we show that the quasi-stationary distribution has the fol-

lowing asymptotic expansion,

π(ε)
j = π(0)

j + πj[1]ε + · · · + πj[k]εk + o(εk), j 6= 0,

(1)

where the coeﬃcients πj[1], . . . , πj[k], can be calculated from explicit recur-
sive formulas. These formulas are functions of the coeﬃcients in the ex-
pansions of the moment functionals mentioned above. The existence of the
expansion (1) and the algorithm for computing the coeﬃcients in this expan-
sion is the main result of this paper.

It is worth mentioning that the asymptotic relation given by equation
(1) simultaneously cover three diﬀerent cases.
In the simplest case, there
exists ε0 > 0 such that transitions to state 0 are not possible for any ε ∈
[0, ε0]. In this case, relation (1) gives asymptotic expansions for stationary
distributions. Then, we have an intermediate case where transitions to state
0 are possible for all ε ∈ (0, ε0] but not possible for ε = 0. In this case we
have that µ(ε)
0 → ∞ in probability as ε → 0. In the mathematically most
diﬃcult case, we have that transitions to state 0 are possible for all ε ∈ [0, ε0].
In this case, the random variables µ(ε)
0 are stochastically bounded as ε → 0.
The expansion (1) is given for continuous time semi-Markov processes in
Gyllenberg and Silvestrov (1999, 2008). However, the discrete time case is
interesting in its own right and deserves a special treatment. In particular, a
discrete time model is often a natural choice in applications where measures
of some quantity of interest are only available at given time points, for ex-
ample days or months. The proof of the result for the continuous time case,
as well as the proofs in the present paper, is based on the theory of non-
linearly perturbed renewal equations. For results related to continuous time
in this line of research, we refer to the comprehensive book by Gyllenberg
and Silvestrov (2008), which also contains an extensive bibliography of work
in related areas. The corresponding theory for discrete time renewal equa-
tions has been developed in Gyllenberg and Silvestrov (1994), Englund and
Silvestrov (1997), Silvestrov and Petersson (2013), and Petersson (2014a, b,
2015).

Quasi-stationary distributions have been studied extensively since the
1960’s. For some of the early works on Markov chains and semi-Markov
processes, see, for example, Vere-Jones (1962), Kingman (1963), Darroch

3

and Seneta (1965), Seneta and Vere-Jones (1966), Cheong (1968, 1970), and
Flaspohler and Holmes (1972). A survey of quasi-stationary distributions for
models with discrete state spaces and more references can be found in van
Doorn and Pollett (2013).

Studies of asymptotic properties for ﬁrst hitting times, stationary dis-
tributions, and other characteristics for Markov chains with linear, polyno-
mial, and analytic perturbations have attracted a lot of attention, see, for
example, Simon and Ando (1961), Schweitzer (1968), Ga˘ıtsgori and Per-
vozvanski˘ı (1975), Courtois and Louchard (1976), Latouche and Louchard
(1978), Delebecque (1983), Latouche (1991), Stewart (1991), Hassin and Ha-
viv (1992), Yin and Zhang (1998, 2003), Altman, Avrachenkov, and N´u˜nez-
Queija (2004), Avrachenkov and Haviv (2004), and Avrachenkov, Filar, and
Howlett (2013). Recently, some of the results of these papers have been ex-
tended to non-linearly perturbed semi-Markov processes. Using a method of
sequential phase space reduction, asymptotic expansions for expected ﬁrst
hitting times and stationary distributions are given in Silvestrov and Silve-
strov (2015). This paper also contains an extensive bibliography.

Let us now brieﬂy comment on the structure of the present paper.

In
Section 2, most of the notation we need are introduced and the main result
is formulated. We apply the discrete time renewal theorem in order to get a
formula for the quasi-stationary distribution in Section 3 and then the proof
of the main result is presented in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5, we illustrate
the results in the special case of discrete time Markov chains.

2 Main Result

In this section we ﬁrst introduce most of the notation that will be used in
the present paper and then we formulate the main result.

For each ε > 0, let ξ(ε)(n), n = 0, 1, . . . , be a discrete time semi-Markov
process on the state space X = {0, 1, . . . , N}, generated by the discrete
time Markov renewal process (η(ε)

ij (ρ, 0), φ(ε)

ij (ρ) = φ(ε)

ij (ρ, 0), ω(ε)

ijs(ρ) = ω(ε)

ijs(ρ, 0).

We now introduce the following conditions:

A:

(a) p(ε)

ij , as ε → 0, i 6= 0, j ∈ X.

ij → p(0)
ij (n) → f (0)

(b) f (ε)

ij (n), as ε → 0, n = 1, 2, . . . , i 6= 0, j ∈ X.

B: g(0)

ij > 0, i, j 6= 0.

C: There exists β > 0 such that:

ii (βi) ∈ (1, ∞), for some i 6= 0 and βi ≤ β.

ij (β) < ∞, for all i 6= 0, j ∈ X.

D: g(0)

ii (n) is a non-periodic distribution for some i 6= 0.

Under the conditions stated above, there exists, for suﬃciently small ε,
so-called quasi-stationary distributions, which are independent of the initial
state i 6= 0, and given by the relation

π(ε)
j = lim
n→∞

Pi{ξ(ε)(n) = j | µ(ε)

0 > n}, j 6= 0.

(2)

An important role for the quasi-stationary distribution is played by the

following characteristic equation,

φ(ε)
ii (ρ) = 1,

(3)

where i 6= 0 is arbitrary.

The following lemma summarizes some important properties for the root

of equation (3). A proof is given in Petersson (2016).

Lemma 1. Under conditions A–C there exists, for suﬃciently small ε, a
unique non-negative solution ρ(ε) of the characteristic equation (3) which is
independent of i. Moreover, ρ(ε) → ρ(0), as ε → 0.

In order to construct an asymptotic expansion for the quasi-stationary
distribution, we need a perturbation condition for the transition probabilities
Q(ε)
ij (k) which is stronger than A. This condition is formulated in terms of
the moment functionals p(ε)

ij (ρ(0), r).

Pk: p(ε)

ij (ρ(0), r) = p(0)

o(εk−r), for r = 0, . . . , k, i 6= 0, j ∈ X, where |pij[ρ(0), r, n]| < ∞, for
r = 0, . . . , k, n = 1, . . . , k − r, i 6= 0, j ∈ X.

The following theorem is the main result of this paper. The proof is given

in Section 4.

Theorem 1. If conditions A–D and Pk+1 hold, then we have the following
asymptotic expansion,

π(ε)
j = π(0)

j + πj[1]ε + · · · + πj[k]εk + o(εk), j 6= 0,

where πj[n], n = 1, . . . , k, j 6= 0, can be calculated from a recursive algorithm
which is described in Section 4.

3 Quasi-Stationary Distributions

In this section we use renewal theory in order to get a formula for the quasi-
stationary distribution.

The probabilities P (ε)

ij (n) = Pi{ξ(ε)(n) = j, µ(ε)

0 > n}, i, j 6= 0, satisfy the

following discrete time renewal equation,

Let us now, for each n = 0, 1, . . . , multiply both sides of (4) by eρ(ε)n,
ii (ρ) = 1. Then, we get

By the deﬁnition of the root of the characteristic equation, relation (5)

deﬁnes a proper renewal equation.

In order to prove our next result, we ﬁrst formulate an auxiliary lemma.

A proof can be found in Petersson (2016).

Lemma 2. Assume that conditions A–C hold. Then there exists δ > ρ(0)
such that:

(i) φ(ε)

kj (ρ) → φ(0)

kj (ρ) < ∞, as ε → 0, ρ ≤ δ, k, j 6= 0.

(ii) ω(ε)

kjs(ρ) → ω(0)

kjs(ρ) < ∞, as ε → 0, ρ ≤ δ, k, j, s 6= 0.

We can now use the classical discrete time renewal theorem in order to

get a formula for the quasi-stationary distribution.

Lemma 3. Assume that conditions A–D hold. Then:

Since h(ε)

each term in the sum is a continuous function of the quantities given in
condition A, we have

h(ε)
ij (n) → h(0)

ij (n), as ε → 0, i, j 6= 0.

It now follows from (10), (11), and (12) that

Relations (6) and (13) show that part (ii) of Lemma 3 holds.

4 Proof of the Main Result

In this section we prove Theorem 1.

Throughout this section, it is assumed that conditions A–D and Pk+1

hold.

The proof is given in a sequence of lemmas. For the proof of the ﬁrst

lemma, we refer to Petersson (2016).

Lemma 4. For r = 0, . . . , k and i, j 6= 0, we have the following asymptotic
expansions,

ω(ε)
iij (ρ(0), r) = aij[r, 0] + aij[r, 1]ε + · · · + aij[r, k − r]εk−r + o(εk−r),

φ(ε)
ii (ρ(0), r) = bi[r, 0] + bi[r, 1]ε + · · · + bi[r, k − r]εk−r + o(εk−r),

(14)

(15)

where the coeﬃcients in these expansions can be calculated from lemmas and
theorems given in Petersson (2016).

Let us now recall from Section 3 that the quasi-stationary distribution,

for suﬃciently small ε, has the following representation,

π(ε)
j =

ω(ε)
iij (ρ(ε))

ω(ε)
ii1 (ρ(ε)) + · · · + ω(ε)

iiN (ρ(ε))

, j = 1, . . . , N.

(16)

The construction of the asymptotic expansion for the quasi-stationary
distribution will be realized in three steps. First, we use the coeﬃcients in
the expansions given by (15) to build an asymptotic expansion for ρ(ε), the
root of the characteristic equation. Then, the coeﬃcients in this expansion
and the coeﬃcients in the expansions given by (14) are used to construct
asymptotic expansions for ω(ε)
iij (ρ(ε)). Finally, relation (16) is used to complete
the proof.

We formulate these steps in the following three lemmas. Let us here
remark that the proof of Lemma 5 is given in Silvestrov and Petersson (2013)
in the context of general discrete time renewal equations and the proofs of
Lemmas 6 and 7 are given in Petersson (2014b) in the context of quasi-
stationary distributions for discrete time regenerative processes. In order to
make the paper more self-contained, we also give the proofs here, in slightly
reduced forms.

Lemma 5. The root of the characteristic equation has the following asymp-
totic expansion,

ρ(ε) = ρ(0) + c1ε + · · · + ckεk + o(εk),

where c1 = −bi[0, 1]/bi[1, 0] and, for n = 2, . . . , k,

Let δ > ρ(0) be the value from Lemma 2. It follows from Lemma 1 that

|∆(ε)| → 0 as ε → 0, so there exist β > 0 and ε1(β) > 0 such that

ρ(0) + |∆(ε)| ≤ β < δ, ε ≤ ε1(β).

Since β < δ, Lemma 2 implies that there exists ε2(β) > 0 such that

k+1 < ∞ and 0 ≤ ζ (ε)

k+1 ≤ 1.

From relation (23) we can successively construct the asymptotic expan-

sion for the root of the characteristic equation.

11

Let us ﬁrst assume that k = 1. In this case (23) implies that

1 = φ(ε)

ii (ρ(0), 0) + ∆(ε)φ(ε)

ii (ρ(0), 1) + (∆(ε))2O(1).

Using (15), (24), and that ∆(ε) → 0 as ε → 0, it follows that

− bi[0, 1]ε = ∆(ε)(bi[1, 0] + o(1)) + o(ε).

(24)

(25)

Dividing both sides of equation (25) by ε and letting ε tend to zero, we
can conclude that ∆(ε)/ε → −bi[0, 1]/bi[1, 0] as ε → 0. From this it follows
that we have the representation

∆(ε) = c1ε + ∆(ε)
1 ,

(26)

where c1 = −bi[0, 1]/bi[1, 0] and ∆(ε)

1 /ε → 0 as ε → 0.

This proves Lemma 5 for the case k = 1.
Let us now assume that k = 2. In this case relation (23) implies that

1 = φ(ε)

ii (ρ(0), 0) + ∆(ε)φ(ε)

ii (ρ(0), 1) +

(∆(ε))2

2

φ(ε)
ii (ρ(0), 2) + (∆(ε))3O(1). (27)

Using (15) and (26) in relation (27) and rearranging gives

−(cid:18)bi[0, 2] + bi[1, 1]c1 +

bi[2, 0]c2
1

2

(cid:19) ε2 = ∆(ε)

1 (bi[1, 0] + o(1)) + o(ε2).

(28)

Dividing both sides of equation (28) by ε2 and letting ε tend to zero, we

can conclude that ∆(ε)

1 /ε2 → c2 as ε → 0, where

c2 = −

1

bi[1, 0](cid:18)bi[0, 2] + bi[1, 1]c1 +

bi[2, 0]c2
1

2

(cid:19) .

From this and (26) it follows that we have the representation

∆(ε) = c1ε + c2ε2 + ∆(ε)
2 ,

where ∆(ε)

2 /ε2 → 0 as ε → 0.

This proves Lemma 5 for the case k = 2.
Continuing in this way we can prove the lemma for any positive integer
k. However, once it is known that the expansion exists, the coeﬃcients can
be obtained in a simpler way. From (15) and (23) we get the following formal
equation,

− (bi[0, 1]ε + bi[0, 2]ε2 + · · · )

= (c1ε + c2ε2 + · · · )(bi[1, 0] + bi[1, 1]ε + · · · )
+ (1/2!)(c1ε + c2ε2 + · · · )2(bi[2, 0] + bi[2, 1]ε + · · · ) + · · ·

(29)

12

By expanding the right hand side of (29) and then equating coeﬃcients of
equal powers of ε in the left and right hand sides, we obtain the formulas
given in Lemma 5.

Lemma 6. For any i, j 6= 0, we have the following asymptotic expansion,

ω(ε)
iij (ρ(ε)) = ω(0)

iij (ρ(0)) + dij[1]ε + · · · + dij[k]εk + o(εk),

where dij[1] = aij[0, 1] + aij[1, 0]c1, and, for n = 2, . . . , k,

dij[n] = aij[0, n] +

where Dm,q is the set of all non-negative integer solutions of the system

n1 + · · · + nq−1 = m,

n1 + 2n2 + · · · + (q − 1)nq−1 = q.

Proof. Let us again use relation (17) given in the proof of Lemma 5. Multi-
plying both sides of (17) by h(ε)

ij (n) and summing over all n we get

ω(ε)
iij (ρ(ε)) =

where fMk+1 = supε≤ε0fM (ε)

∆(ε) = c1ε + · · · + ckεk + o(εk).

Substituting the expansions (14) and (32) into relation (31) yields

iij (ρ(ε)) = ω(0)

iij (ρ(0)) + aij[0, 1]ε + · · · + aij[0, k]εk + o(εk)

(33)

By expanding the right hand side of (33) and grouping coeﬃcients of equal
powers of ε we get the expansions and formulas given in Lemma 6.

Lemma 7. For any j 6= 0, we have the following asymptotic expansion,

π(ε)
j = π(0)

j + πj[1]ε + · · · + πj[k]εk + o(εk).

(34)

The coeﬃcients πj[n], n = 1, . . . , k, j 6= 0, are for any i 6= 0 given by the
following recursive formulas,

πj[n] =

where πj[0] = π(0)

n−1Xq=0
iij (ρ(0)), and ei[n] =Pj6=0 dij[n], n = 0, . . . , k.

Proof. It follows from formula (16) and Lemma 6 that we for all i, j 6= 0 have

π(ε)
j =

dij[0] + dij[1]ε + · · · + dij[k]εk + o(εk)
ei[0] + ei[1]ε + · · · + ei[k]εk + o(εk)

.

(35)

Since ei[0] > 0, it follows from (35) that the expansion (34) exists. From

this and (35) we get the following equation,

(ei[0] + ei[1]ε + · · · + ei[k]εk + o(εk))

× (πj[0] + πj[1]ε + · · · + πj[k]εk + o(εk))
= dij[0] + dij[1]ε + · · · + dij[k]εk + o(εk).

(36)

By expanding the left hand side of (36) and then equating coeﬃcients of
equal powers of ε in the left and right hand sides, we obtain the coeﬃcients
given in Lemma 7.

5 Perturbed Markov Chains

In this section it is shown how the results of the present paper can be ap-
plied in the special case of perturbed discrete time Markov chains. As an
illustration, we present a simple numerical example.

For every ε ≥ 0, let η(ε)

n , n = 0, 1, . . . , be a homogeneous discrete time
Markov chain with state space X = {0, 1, . . . , N}, an initial distribution
i = P{η(ε)
p(ε)

0 = i}, i ∈ X, and transition probabilities

p(ε)
ij = P{η(ε)

n+1 = j | η(ε)

n = i}, i, j ∈ X.

14

This model is a particular case of a semi-Markov process. In this case,

the transition probabilities are given by

Q(ε)

ij (n) = p(ε)

ij χ(n = 1), n = 1, 2, . . . , i, j ∈ X.

Furthermore, mixed power-exponential moment functionals for transition

probabilities take the following form,

p(ε)
ij (ρ, r) =

∞Xn=0

nreρnQ(ε)

ij (n) = eρp(ε)

ij , ρ ∈ R, r = 0, 1, . . . , i, j ∈ X.

(37)

Conditions A–D and Pk imposed in Section 2 now hold if the following

conditions are satisﬁed:

A′: g(0)

ij > 0, i, j 6= 0.

B′: g(0)

ii (n) is non-periodic for some i 6= 0.

P′

ij + pij[1]ε + · · · + pij[k]εk + o(εk), i, j 6= 0, where |pij[n]| < ∞,

k: p(ε)

ij = p(0)
n = 1, . . . , k, i, j 6= 0.

Let us here remark that in order to construct an asymptotic expansion
of order k for the quasi-stationary distribution of a Markov chain, it is suf-
ﬁcient to assume that the perturbation condition holds for the parameter k,
and not for k + 1 as needed for semi-Markov processes. The stronger per-
turbation condition with parameter k + 1 is needed in order to construct the
asymptotic expansions given in equation (14). However, for Markov chains
these expansions can be constructed under the weaker perturbation condi-
tion. This follows from results given in Petersson (2016).

It follows from (37) and P′

k that the coeﬃcients in the perturbation con-

dition Pk are given by

pij[ρ(0), r, n] = eρ(0)

pij[n], r = 0, . . . , k, n = 0, . . . , k − r, i, j 6= 0.

(38)

Let us illustrate the remarks made above by means of a simple numerical
example where we compute the asymptotic expansion of second order for
the quasi-stationary distribution of a Markov chain with four states. We
consider the simplest case where transitions to state 0 is not possible for the
limiting Markov chain. In this case, exact computations can be made and
we can focus on the algorithm itself and need not need to consider possible
numerical issues.

15

We consider a perturbed Markov chain η(ε)

n , n = 0, 1, . . . , on the state

space X = {0, 1, 2, 3} with a matrix of transition probabilities given by

(39)

First, using the well known asymptotic expansion for the exponential
k. The non-zero coeﬃcients

function, we obtain the coeﬃcients in condition P′
in this condition take the following numerical values,

p12[0] = 1,
p12[1] = −1,
p12[2] = 1/2, p23[2] = 1/2, p31[2] = 1,

p31[0] = 1/2, p32[0] = 1/2,
p32[1] = −1,
p31[1] = −1,
p32[2] = 1.

p23[0] = 1,
p23[1] = −1,

(40)

Then, the root of the characteristic equation for the limiting Markov chain
needs to be found. Since φ(0)
i } = 1, we have ρ(0) = 0. In
the case where transitions to state 0 is possible also for the limiting Markov
chain, the root ρ(0) needs to be computed numerically.

ii (0) = Pi{ν(0)

0 > ν(0)

Now, using that ρ(0) = 0 and relations (38) and (40), we obtain the

coeﬃcients in condition Pk.

Next step is to determine the coeﬃcients in the expansions given in equa-
tions (14) and (15) for the case where k = 2 and i is some ﬁxed state which
we can choose arbitrarily. Let us choose i = 1. In order to compute these
coeﬃcients we apply the results given in Petersson (2016). According to
these results, we can, based on the coeﬃcients in condition Pk, compute the
following asymptotic vector expansions,

Φ(ε)

Φ(ε)

1 (0, 0) = Φ1[0, 0, 0] + Φ1[0, 0, 1]ε + Φ1[0, 0, 2]ε2 + o(ε2),

1j (0, 1) = ω1j[0, 1, 0] + ω1j[0, 1, 1]ε + o(ε),

In particular, from (41) and (42) we can extract the following asymptotic

expansions,

φ(ε)
11 (0, 0) = b1[0, 0] + b1[0, 1]ε + b1[0, 2]ε2 + o(ε2),
φ(ε)
11 (0, 1) = b1[1, 0] + b1[1, 1]ε + o(ε),
φ(ε)
11 (0, 2) = b1[2, 0] + o(1),

and, for j = 1, 2, 3,

ω(ε)
11j(0, 0) = a1j[0, 0] + a1j[0, 1]ε + a1j[0, 2]ε2 + o(ε2),
ω(ε)
11j(0, 1) = a1j[1, 0] + a1j[1, 1]ε + o(ε),
ω(ε)
11j(0, 2) = a1j[2, 0] + o(1).

From (41) and (43) it follows that

b1[0, 0] = 1,
b1[1, 0] = 5,

b1[0, 1] = −7,
b1[1, 1] = −47,

b1[0, 2] = 67/2,
b1[2, 0] = 33.

(44)

By ﬁrst calculating the coeﬃcients in (42), we then get the following

numerical values,

a11[0, 0] = 1, a12[0, 0] = 2,
a11[0, 1] = 0, a12[0, 1] = −8,
a11[0, 2] = 0, a12[0, 2] = 34,
a11[1, 0] = 0, a12[1, 0] = 6,
a11[1, 1] = 0, a12[1, 1] = −48, a13[1, 1] = −64,
a11[2, 0] = 0, a12[2, 0] = 34,

a13[0, 0] = 2,
a13[0, 1] = −10,
a13[0, 2] = 43,
a13[1, 0] = 8,

a13[2, 0] = 48.

(45)

17

The asymptotic expansion for the quasi-stationary distribution can now
be computed from the coeﬃcients in equations (44) and (45) by applying the
lemmas in Section 4.

From Lemma 5 we get that the asymptotic expansion for the root of the

characteristic equation is given by

ρ(ε) = c1ε + c2ε2 + o(ε2),

where

c1 = −

b1[0, 1]

b1[1, 0]

125

.

(46)

Then, Lemma 6 gives us the following asymptotic expansions,

ω(ε)
11j(ρ(ε)) = d1j[0] + d1j[1]ε + d1j[2]ε2 + o(ε2), j = 1, 2, 3,

where

d1j[0] = a1j[0, 0],
d1j[1] = a1j[0, 1] + a1j[1, 0]c1,
d1j[2] = a1j[0, 2] + a1j[1, 1]c1 + a1j[1, 0]c2 + a1j[2, 0]c2

1/2.

From (45), (46), and (47), we calculate

d11[0] = 1, d12[0] = 2,
d11[1] = 0, d12[1] = 2/5,
d11[2] = 0, d12[2] = 9/125, d13[2] = 47/125.

d13[0] = 2,
d13[1] = 6/5,

Finally, let us use Lemma 7. First, using (48), we get

e1[0] = d11[0] + d12[0] + d13[0] = 5,
e1[1] = d11[1] + d12[1] + d13[1] = 8/5,
e1[2] = d11[2] + d12[2] + d13[2] = 56/125.

(47)

(48)

(49)

Then, we can construct the asymptotic expansion for the quasi-stationary

distribution,

where

π(ε)
j = πj[0] + πj[1]ε + πj[2]ε2 + o(ε2), j = 1, 2, 3,

πj[0] = d1j[0]/e1[0],
πj[1] = (d1j[1] − e1[1]πj[0])/e1[0],
πj[2] = (d1j[2] − e1[2]πj[0] − e1[1]πj[1])/e1[0].

(50)

18

Using (48), (49), and (50), the following numerical values are obtained,

π1[0] = 1/5,
π1[1] = −8/125, π2[1] = −6/125,
π1[2] = 8/3125,

π3[0] = 2/5,
π3[1] = 14/125,
π2[2] = −19/3125, π3[2] = 11/3125.

π2[0] = 2/5,

Note here that (π1[0], π2[0], π3[0]) is the stationary distribution of the limiting
Markov chain. It is also worth noticing that π1[n] + π2[n] + π3[n] = 0 for
n = 1, 2, as expected.
