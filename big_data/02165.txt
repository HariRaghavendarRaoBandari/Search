In this work we study the partially constrained vielbein formulation of the new quasidilaton
theory of massive gravity which couples to both physical and ﬁducial metrics simultaneously via a
composite eﬀective metric. This formalism improves the new quasidilaton model since the Boulware-
Deser ghost is removed fully non-linearly at all scales. This also yields crucial implications in the
cosmological applications. We derive the governing cosmological background evolution and study
the stability of the attractor solution.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Introduction of a non-zero graviton mass is one of the simplest modiﬁcations to the general theory of relativity.
Massive gravity theories were ﬁrst proposed by Fierz and Pauli in 1939 [1], and it gained renewed interest since the
discovery of the nonlinear completion by de Rham, Gabadadze and Tolley (dRGT) [2], in which the Bouleware-Deser
(BD) ghost [3] is absent even at the non-linear level [4]. The theory is elaborate but encloses indispensable promising
properties, the technically naturalness being one of them [5–7].1 Since its inception the allowed cosmology of dRGT
theory has been widely discussed [9–19]. This topic is attracting interest because a nonzero graviton mass may
induce the accelerated expansion of the universe and could be an alternative to the cosmological constant and dark
energy. The original form of dRGT massive gravity theory encountered several problems such as absence of solutions
describing a realistic cosmology without pathological behaviors [17, 20–23], and many extensions of the theories were
proposed to alleviate these issues [24–28].

In this work, we focus on a speciﬁc extension, obtained via a scalar ﬁeld associated with a global quasi-dilaton

symmetry [25]

σ → σ + σ0 ,

fµν → e−2 σ0/MPl fµν ,

where fµν corresponds to the non-dynamical ﬁducial metric, while the physical metric gµν is invariant under these
transformations. The action invariant under this symmetry depends on the combination e2 σ/MPl fµν, where the
conformal factor allows the otherwise absent ﬂat cosmological solutions with self-accelerated expansion. On the other
hand, the original theory has also pathological cosmological solutions [29, 30] although generalization of the original
action to include an additional coupling constant does address this issue [26, 31]. Even if the background evolution
is insensitive to the presence of this new coupling constant, the stability of the perturbations crucially depends on it,
hence allowing to cure the reported instability in the original formulation [26, 31, 32]. In the standard formulation
of massive gravity, the graviton mass is at most of the the same order as the Hubble expansion rate today. Since
the eﬀective mass of the tensor perturbations is proportional to the graviton mass, this enforces the eﬀective mass of
gravitational waves to be of the same order. In the presence of the new coupling constant in the extended quasidilaton
theory this restriction can be softened and it could even accommodate an explanation for the large-angle suppression
of power in the microwave background [33].

Another promising extension is the new quasidilaton theory which is based on modifying the coupling of the
quasidilaton ﬁeld to the metrics [34]. In this case, instead of minimally coupling the quasidilaton Lagrangian only
to the physical metric, it now couples to a combination of both physical and ﬁducial metrics. Such a composite
coupling generically revives the BD ghost into the theory [35, 36], nevertheless there is a unique eﬀective metric in
the sense that it maintains the theory ghost free up to the strong coupling scale [37–39]. This modiﬁcation also
introduces an additional parameter to the theory which can be tuned to make the accelerated expansion and stability
of cosmological solutions compatible with each other. One downside of this theory was that the additional parameter
in the quasidilaton coupling must be tuned to make the mass of the ghost degree of freedom suﬃciently high. Such
a tuning becomes unnecessary if the ghost degree of freedom is absent at all scales. One way to realize this was
initially thought to come from redeﬁning the theory in the unconstrained vielbein formulation, in which the theory
is formulated in the vielbein language and the dynamics of the vielbein is determined by its own equations of motion
but not by the symmetric vielbein conditions [40]. Unfortunately, in this formalism the ghost degree of freedom is
reintroduced to the theory when the rotation part of the vielbein is integrated out [37]. Instead, this issue can be
circumvented by adopting the partially constrained vielbein formalism [28] where the rotational part of the vielbein is
symmetric by construction and the boost part is determined by their equations of motion. In this formalism the ghost
degree of freedom is absent fully non-linearly, hence the allowed parameter region is enlarged as described above.

In this paper we examine de Sitter solutions of new quasidilaton theory in the partially constrained vielbein for-
malism and provide a stability analysis of perturbations. The background dynamics and the dispersion relations for
the tensor and vector perturbations in this extended theory is the same as in the metric formulation, while the crucial
diﬀerence arises in the scalar perturbations. After introducing the partially constrained vielbein formalism in Section
II, we derive the late–time de Sitter attractor background in Section III. Section IV is devoted to the stability
conditions against ghost and gradient instabilities for this background. We conclude this work with summary and
discussions in Section V. The paper is supplemented by the Appendix, where the results for the metric formulation
is summarized for comparison.

II. PARTIALLY CONSTRAINED FORMULATION OF NEW QUASIDILATON THEORY

In this section we would like to introduce the new quasidilaton theory in the partially constrained vielbein formu-
lation. We shall adapt the vielbein formulation of massive gravity. For this purpose, we express the two metrics by
the following vielbeins as

gµν = ηABeA

µeB

ν

and

fµν = ηABEA

µEB

ν ,

(2)

where A, B = 0, 1, 2, 3 are the indices in the orthonormal bases. Since in quasi-dilaton theories, the ﬁducial metric only
appears with the conformal factor e−2 σ/MPl , it is useful to further deﬁne an orthonormal basis for this combination
as

e−2 σ/MPl fµν = ηAB ˜EA

µ ˜EB

ν ,

˜EA

µ = e− σ/MPl EA

µ .

(3)

In this formulation, the mass term corresponds to the interactions between the two vielbeins eA
out of their wedge products [41]

The invariance under the overall local Lorentz transformation of the two vielbeins allows us to ﬁx the gauge
freedom associated with the boost part of the overall local Lorentz transformation. We can do that by choosing the
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) form for the ﬁducial vielbein

(6)

where I, J = 1, 2, 3 correspond to the spatial indices in the orthonormal basis. Here, M , M i and EI
j are the ﬁducial
lapse, the ﬁducial shift and the ﬁducial spatial vielbein since the corresponding 4-dimensional ﬁducial metric fµν
becomes

fµν dxµdxν = −M 2dt2 + fij(dxi + M idt)(dxj + M jdt),

fij = δIJ EI

j.

(7)

We cannot bring the physical vielbein into the ADM form simultaneously, however we can write it in the boosted
ADM form, such as

where we have introduced the ADM vielbein

and (e−ω)A
lapse N , the physical shift N i, and the physical spatial vielbein eI
function of the boost parameter bI , as in ωA
of these variables the physical metric becomes

B represents a general proper boost transformation. The ADM vielbein is deﬁned through the physical
j, whereas the Lorentz-boost transformation is a
B, and LI are the three generators of the boost. In terms

B =PI bI(LI )A

gµν dxµdxν = −N 2dt2 + gij(dxi + N idt)(dxj + N jdt),

gij = δIJ eI

ieJ
j.

(10)

Besides ﬁxing the boost part of the overall local Lorentz transformation as (6), we further impose the following

symmetric condition on the 3-dimensional spatial vielbein [28]

YIJ = YJI ,

(11)

I δJKeK

where YIJ ≡ E l
l . This condition (11) does not correspond to a gauge condition but is rather a physical
condition yielding a diﬀerent formulation of the original theory, which was dubbed “partially constrained vielbein
formulation”. This physical condition (11) puts the spatial components and the temporal component of the vielbein
on diﬀerent footing, violating local Lorentz invariance in the gravity sector.

The composite metric is constructed as [35, 42]

where the composite vielbein is a linear combination of the two vielbeins, enriched with the quasidilaton ﬁeld

(12)

(13)

Finally, the general action consisting of the dynamical vielbein, the quasidilaton ﬁeld that lives on the eﬀective vielbein
and the standard matter ﬁelds living on the dynamical vielbein of the theory reads

The most general Lagrangian for the quasi-dilaton ﬁeld that is invariant under (1) was given in Ref. [31]. In this
paper, for the sake of simplicity, we choose the canonical action

III. COSMOLOGICAL BACKGROUND AND LATE TIME DE SITTER SOLUTION

We shall as next study the cosmological background evolution of the quasidilaton living on the composite eﬀective
metric2. First of all, we will choose the unitary gauge, and we will consider the class of theories deﬁned by the
following ﬁducial vielbein components as in

M = M (t) ,

M i = 0 ,

EI

j = a0 δI

j ,

(16)

0δijdxidxj .
so that the ﬁducial metric is Minkowski with the general lapse function M (t), fµνdxµdxν = −M 2(t)dt2 + a2
Furthermore, we will assume that on the background bI = 0, such that the symmetry condition for YIJ implies that
the 3d ADM vielbein on the background εI

j(t) is symmetric, allowing us to ﬁx the latter as

εI

j(t) = a(t) δI

j .

(17)

In the following we will also ﬁx, without loss of generality (i.e. keeping the time-like St¨uckelberg ﬁeld, and thus the
ﬁducial lapse, as a general function of the time t), N (t) = 1. The corresponding lapse function and scale factor of the
background composite eﬀective vielbein then become

respectively, where we deﬁned

(18)

(19)

A quasidilaton conﬁguration compatible with this setup is a homogeneous one, i.e. σ = σ(t). Finally, since we will
focus on de Sitter attractor solutions, in the remainder of the text, we consider only a cosmological constant in the
matter sector that only couples to the physical vielbein. The ﬁrst trivial observation is that the background equations
of motion in the partially constrained vielbein formulation are exactly the same as in the metric formulation. This
was already pointed out in [28] for the case of dRGT massive gravity. The equations of motion for this conﬁguration
is obtained as3

In Eq. (20) and below, instead of using the βn coeﬃcients, we employ the following polynomial

U (X) = β0X 4 + 4 β1X 3 + 6 β2X 2 + 4 β3X + β4 ,

(20)

(21)

(22)

2 Further cosmological implications of the composite eﬀective metric have been studied in [35, 43–49] and dark matter phenomenology in

[50–52].

3 For the details of the background equations, we refer the reader to Appendix A where these are derived for the metric formulation. As

stressed in the main text, the two formulations coincide at the background level.

We now look for de Sitter solutions, i.e. H = H0 = constant. Combining (i) and (iv) in Eq. (20), we ﬁnd:

(24)

The last term in the right hand side of the above equation redshifts as a−4, while the part ∝ m2 consists of terms
which at most redshift as X 3 ∼ a−3. Therefore, for a late time solution, we can safely ignore the term arising from
the integration constant κ. In this late time limit, Eq. (24) thus implies that X = X0 = constant on the attractor
solution.

Following a similar argument, we can also combine (ii) and (iv) in Eq. (20). As X is constant, the functions J(X0)
and ρm,f (X0) are also constant on the attractor, implying that r = r0 = constant on the late time de Sitter solution.
In other words, both aeﬀ /a and Neﬀ are constant. Then, Eq. (20.iv) trivially implies that ˙σ/Neﬀ = constant. Finally,
using all this information in Eq. (20.iii) above, while simultaneously using Eqs. (ii) and (iv), one can show that

The non-trivial solution gives the background evolution of the quasi-dilaton as

˙σ (cid:18) ˙σ

MPl − H0(cid:19) = 0 .

˙σ

MPl

= H0 .

(25)

(26)

In the following, the strategy for going on shell is as follows. We solve (i) for Λ, (ii) and (iv) for J(X0) and ρm,f (X0).
Eq. (iii) is trivially satisﬁed once the solution (26) is used. Then, on the attractor, the derivatives of equations (20)
are automatically satisﬁed.

For the sake of a clear notation, in the remainder of the text we omit the subscript 0 denoting the values on the

attractor.

IV. STABILITY OF THE DE SITTER ATTRACTOR

In this section we will study the stability of the attractor solution. Then we need to introduce perturbation variables

for all the dynamical variables. As for the physical ADM vielbein, we can write it

εA

µ =(cid:18) 1 + Φ 0j

kN k εI

εI

j (cid:19) ,

where the shift vector is perturbed as

whereas the three dimensional ADM vielbein as

Ni = a (Bk + ∂kB) ,

4 We remark that the four functions deﬁned in Eq. (23) are not enough to solve for the ﬁve parameters βn. The ﬁfth combination of βn

can be absorbed into the cosmological constant Λ ≡ m2β4.

6

where δij∂iBj = δij∂iEj = δij∂iγjk = δijγij = 0. Recall that we are performing the perturbation analysis above a
background where the Lorentz transformation exactly vanishes ωA
B(t) = 0. Furthermore, our partially constrained
vielbein formulation is such that only the boost part of the Lorentz transformations propagates so that its perturbation
variables can be written as

We also need to consider the perturbation of the quasidilaton ﬁeld σ as

δω0I = ∂I v + vI ,

σ = σ(t) + MPlδσ .

(30)

(31)

All the perturbed quantities have both time and space dependence. Our perturbations on top of the de Sitter attractor
neglecting the standard matter ﬁeld contain na¨ıvely counted fourteen degrees of freedom (dof), where two of them are
the massive transverse–traceless symmetric spatial tensor ﬁelds (hij), six of them are divergence-free spatial vector
ﬁelds (Bi, Ei, vi) and the remaining six dof are scalar ﬁelds (Φ, B, ψ, E, v, σ). We will see explicitly that the vector
modes Bi and vi are actually non-dynamical and the same is true for the scalar ﬁelds Φ, B and v.

Throughout this Section, the background is the de Sitter attractor; the quantities r, H, X, Neﬀ and aeﬀ/a have

constant values dictated by the background equations of motion discussed in the previous Section.

Let us ﬁrst start our analysis of the tensor perturbations. For this we decompose the tensor ﬁeld hij in Fourier

modes with respect to the spatial coordinates

then apply the above perturbation decomposition to our Lagrangian and expand it to quadratic order in the tensor
perturbations. On the de Sitter attractor solution, the quadratic action becomes

where it should be understood that hij is the mode function in momentum space. The mass of the tensor graviton is
a constant and is given by

T = m2Γ −
m2

α β ω aeﬀ X H 2

2 a Neﬀ

,

(34)

where Γ was deﬁned in Eq. (23). One immediate observation is that the tensor perturbations behave exactly as in
the metric formulation, on the late-time de Sitter background. This is due to the fact that the boost parameters
contribute only to the vector and scalar perturbations. The tensor perturbations do not yield any ghost nor gradient
instabilities as usual for variants of dRGT massive gravity, while the absence of a tachyonic instability can be ensured
if m2

T > 0.

As we did for the tensor perturbations, we ﬁrst decompose the vector modes Ei, Bi and vi in Fourier modes. The

action for the vector modes around the de Sitter attractor yields

For the absence of the ghost instability one has to simply impose KV > 0. The absence of the tachyonic instability
in the tensor sector equally means the absence of gradient instabilities in the vector modes.

Finally, we move on to the scalar perturbations. As mentioned above not all of the scalar dof propagate. In fact,

we can use the equations of motion for the non-dynamical degrees B, Φ and v to integrate them out

where K and Ω2 are symmetric 2 × 2 matrices, while M is an anti-symmetric 2 × 2 matrix. The components of these
matrices are not suitable for presentation. On the other hand, all we are interested in are the positivity of the kinetic
terms and the positivity of the coeﬃcients of the k2 terms in the dispersion relations of the eigenfrequencies. Both of
these tasks become practical in the superhorizon limit, i.e. k ≫ a H.
where

From the positivity of the kinetic matrix K we can read out the no-ghost conditions as NG1 > 0 and NG2 > 0,

The counterparts of the no-ghost conditions NG1 > 0 and NG2 > 0 in the metric formalism are given in Eqs. (A21)–

however, does not reduce to the second of (A22). This diﬀerence is one of the new features introduced by switching
from the metric formalism to the partially-constrained vielbein formalism.

while the positivity of the squared sound speeds, necessary to avoid gradient instability, requires A > 0 and B >
0. Again there is a qualitative diﬀerence compared to the metric formalism.
In the metric formalism, where the
propagation speeds are given by Eq. (A26), the gradient term in the dispersion relation of one of the modes is zero,
i.e. there is a non-propagating mode. However, we see that the situation has now changed in the constrained vielbein
formulation, as the said mode acquires a non-zero sound speed.

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this work we studied the new quasidilaton theory in the partially-constrained vielbein formulation. This formalism
mimics the ideas proposed and studied recently in [53, 54], where it was aimed to remove the unwanted and unstable
degrees of freedom of the dRGT theory and keep only the tensor modes. Even if in our formalism the vector and
scalar modes are kept as well, we get rid of the BD ghost at the fully non-linear level. It is well known that one can
decompose any general vielbein into a Lorentz boost and rotation of a triangular vielbein. Using advantage of this fact,
in [40] it was shown that the integration of the boost parameters results in a linear Hamiltonian. Notwithstanding the
integration of the remaining rotation parameters gives a Hamiltonian highly non-linear in the lapses [37]. Hence, we
constructed our partially constrained vielbeins exactly with the purpose that the rotation parameters can no longer
reintroduce the non-linearities in the lapses. Our aim in the present work was to examine the stability of cosmological
solutions in the new quasidilaton theory in this new formulation. In the metric formalism, the BD ghost may appear
above an energy scale that depends on the parameter β in the quasidilaton coupling, and more speciﬁcally β must
be tuned suﬃciently small to make the mass of the BD ghost larger than the cutoﬀ scale of the theory as argued in
the summary of Ref. [34]. In the partially-constrained vielbein formalism, the BD ghost is absent nonlinearly and
hence the ﬁne-tuning mentioned above becomes unnecessary. Thanks to this property the allowed parameter region
is greatly enlarged in the latter formulation.

The change in the formalism does not aﬀect the background solutions and also perturbations in the tensor and
vector sectors. Since we gave the detailed calculation of the perturbations in the metric formalism in the appendix,
they can be directly compared with those in the partially-constrained vielbein formalism. As usual the ghost and
gradient stability of the tensor perturbations is guaranteed. Additionally, by imposing the mass of the tensor modes to
be positive we avoid tachyonic instability. On the other hand the stability of the vector perturbations is granted only
by further demanding KV > 0. The scalar perturbations yield the new diﬀerence between the diﬀerent formulations.
The constraint for the absence of ghost and gradient instability is crucially changed.

The partially-constrained vielbein formalism can be applied also to the bimetric theories to modify stability proper-
ties of cosmological solutions. It would be interesting to examine implications of such modiﬁcations to the cosmology
in various extensions of massive gravity theories.

Appendix A: Metric formulation of the new quasidilaton theory

In this appendix we summarize the computation of cosmological perturbations around de Sitter background for
new quasidilaton theory in the metric formulation. Although this analysis has been already worked out in Ref. [34],
to facilitate direct comparison with the partially-constrained vielbein formalism, we include some intermediate steps
to trace the diﬀerence between the two approaches. The action we consider is

with the St¨uckelberg ﬁelds φa. Note that there is no disformal transformation to the ﬁducial metric anymore as in
the extended quasidilaton scenario [26], i.e. here the ﬁeld space is 4-dimensional. The purpose of introducing this
disformal factor was actually to render the self-accelerating late-time asymptotic solutions stable. In [34] it was shown
that this purpose is achieved also with the coupling to the eﬀective metric (although it is still compatible with the
global quasi-dilaton symmetry).

We concretize our dynamical background metric to be of the homogeneous and isotropic ﬂat FLRW form

We then choose the unitary gauge, i.e. φ0 = ϕ(t), φa = a0 xa giving the ﬁducial metric

(A8)

(A9)

which we plugged in Eq. (23) to deﬁne the quantities ρm,g, ρm,f , J and Γ, replacing the αn coeﬃcients.

At this point, we stress that the action (A1) is almost the same as the partially-constrained vielbein action (14).
The diﬀerence between the two formalisms arises from the diﬀerent choice of quantities that are used in the variation.
To be speciﬁc, the partially-constrained vielbein formalism can be seen to contain four new auxiliary ﬁelds, i.e. the
boosts. As the choice of cosmological background does not excite these degrees of freedom (due to isotropy), the
background of the two formalisms are identical.

The background equations of motion can be calculated simply by varying the action (A8) with respect to the lapse
N , scale factor a, quasi-dilaton ﬁeld σ and the temporal St¨uckelberg ﬁeld ϕ, giving the set of equations listed in (20)
for N = 1. One of these is a redundant equation, due to the contracted Bianchi identity

In order to compare the stability of the perturbations in the metric formulation with those in the partially con-
strained vielbein formulation, from here on we will specify to the late time dS attractor detailed in Sec. III and ﬁx
the residual gauge freedom in time coordinate by setting N = 1. We choose a decomposition that is compatible with
Eqs. (27)–(29) at linear order:

δg00 = −2 N 2 Φ ,
δg0i = N a (∂iB + Bi) ,
δgij = a2(cid:20)2 δijψ +(cid:18)∂i∂j −

δij
3

∂k∂k(cid:19) E + ∂(iEj)(cid:21) ,

(A11)

where the vector perturbations are transverse ∂iEi = ∂iBi = 0, and we disregarded the tensor perturbations as
they are exactly the same in both formalisms at linear order. We also ﬁx all of the gauge freedom by setting the
perturbations for the four St¨uckelberg ﬁelds to zero. Similarly, the quasidilaton σ is perturbed as

σ = σ(t) + MPlδσ .

(A12)

Excluding the tensor modes, the action (A1) contains na¨ıvely counted nine degrees of freedom (dof), four of them
being divergence-free spatial vector ﬁelds (Bi, Ei). The other ﬁve dof are scalar ﬁelds (Φ, B, ψ, E, δσ). Of course
not all of them are dynamical. In what follows we will investigate the stability conditions of the vector and scalar
perturbations above the dynamical background equations after integrating out the non-dynamical degrees of freedom.
We start with the stability conditions of the vector modes and expand the Lagrangian (A1) to second order in the

vector perturbations:

At this level, there is an immediate departure from the corresponding action in the constrained vielbein formalism (35).
The latter expression reduces to the metric formulation one if the boost parameter is forced to be vi = Bi/(1 + r) [28].
We notice that not all of the vector ﬁelds are dynamical, indeed, the vector ﬁelds Bi do not have any time–kinetic
i and Bi and integrate them out by using

where c2
V now corresponds to the propagation speed of subhorizon modes. For the stability of vector perturbations
on top of the de Sitter background, we have to impose the right sign for the kinetic and gradient terms. For the
absence of ghost instability, we require that the kinetic term is positive. This can be achieved for any k if we impose
m2

T /c2
Last but not least let us concentrate on the stability of the scalar perturbations in the new extended quasi-dilaton
massive gravity model with matter ﬁeld. As we mentioned above, ﬁve degrees of freedom appear in form of scalar
ﬁelds (ψ, δσ, E, B, Φ). We ﬁrst expand the action (A1) to quadratic order in the scalar perturbations in their Fourier
modes. We ﬁrst note that the corresponding kinetic matrix has two vanishing eigenvalues, which signals the existence
of two constraint equations which make two out of the ﬁve scalar ﬁelds non-propagating

Kψ,δσ,E,B,Φ =

Since the quadratic action does not have any kinetic term for the scalar ﬁelds B and Φ, we can compute their equations

respectively,

(A18)

Comparing these equations with the constrained vielbein formalism counterparts (39)–(41), we notice that the δσ
equation (40) remains the same in both formalisms, while the B equation is diﬀerent. Like the vector modes, the
metric formulation can be obtained if the scalar boost parameter v is forced by hand to be B/(1 + r). However,
in the constrained vielbein formulation, as v is treated as an independent variable, we obtain a completely diﬀerent
perturbation spectrum compared to the metric formulation.

After using the constraint equations, the resulting action depends on the remaining three scalar ﬁelds (ψ, δσ, E).
However, looking at the kinetic matrix of these three remaining scalar ﬁelds, one immediately observes that it still
has a vanishing determinant, meaning that there is a constraint that can be used to integrate out one more scalar
degree of freedom. This degree, i.e. the would-be BD ghost, becomes manifestly non-dynamical in the ﬁeld basis (42).
Integrating out the now non-dynamical ψ, the reduced action takes the following form:

(A19)

where K and Ω2 are symmetric 2× 2 matrices, while M is anti-symmetric 2× 2 matrix. As in the constrained vielbein
formulation, these matrices are too bulky for presentation, although we now show their subhorizon limit. The kinetic
matrix in this limit becomes diagonal at leading order with:

K11 = κ1 + O(k−2) ,

K12 = O(k0) ,

K22 = κ2 k2 + O(k0) .

(A20)

(A21)

At leading order in large k expansion, κ1 and κ2k2 also correspond to the eigenvalues of the kinetic matrix K.
Therefore, the no-ghost conditions for this system in subhorizon scales are simply

κ1 > 0 ,

κ2 > 0 .

(A22)

In order to determine the propagation speeds, we use the fact that the frequency in the UV is dominated by
ω = cs k +O(k0) term. We then solve for the following determinant equation, obtained by considering monochromatic
waves in the equation of motion for perturbations:

(A23)

At leading order, the 11 component of the matrix inside the square brackets goes as k2, the 12 component goes as k2
and the 22 component goes as k4. Thus, only the following components actually contribute to the above determinant
at leading order:
