Abstract Polarization-sensitive, microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs)
are under development for the next-generation BLAST instrument (BLAST-TNG).
BLAST-TNG is a balloon-borne submillimeter polarimeter designed to study mag-
netic ﬁelds in diffuse dust regions and molecular clouds. We present the design
and performance of feedhorn-coupled, dual-polarization sensitive MKIDs fabri-
cated from TiN/Ti multilayer ﬁlms, which have been optimized for the 250 µm
band. Measurements show effective selection of linear polarization and good elec-
trical isolation between the orthogonally crossed X and Y detectors within a single
spatial pixel. The detector cross-polar coupling is <3%. Passband measurements
are presented, which demonstrate that the desired band-edges (1.0-1.4 THz) have
been achieved. We ﬁnd a near linear response to the optical load from a black-
body source, which has been observed in previous devices fabricated from TiN.
Blackbody-coupled noise measurements demonstrate that the sensitivity of the
detectors is limited by photon-noise when the optical load is greater than 1 pW.

and 500 µm wavebands. The instrument utilizes a stepped half-wave plate to re-
duce systematics. The general requirement of the detectors is that they are photon-
noise-limited and dual-polarization sensitive. To achieve this goal, we are de-
veloping three monolithic arrays of cryogenic sensors, one for each waveband.
Each array is feedhorn-coupled and each spatial pixel consists of two orthog-
onally spaced polarization-sensitive microwave kinetic inductance detectors [3]
(MKIDs) fabricated from a Ti/TiN multilayer ﬁlm. In previous work, we demon-
strated photon-noise-limited sensitivity in 250 µm waveband single polarization
devices [4]. In this work, we present the ﬁrst results of dual-polarization sensitive
MKIDs at 250 µm.

2 Detector Design

Our detection scheme utilizes feedhorn/waveguide, front-side optical coupling and
places the inductive section of a lumped-element kinetic inductance detector [5]
one-quarter wavelength away from a reﬂective backshort. This coupling approach
is described in detail in Hubmayr et al [4].

The devices are fabricated from TiN/Ti proximitized ﬁlms, which have a tun-
able and spatially uniform Tc [6]. The TiN(Ti) thickness is 4(10) nm, which sets
Tc=1.35 K. By stacking a number of bilayers, we may tune the sheet resistance of
the ﬁlm without altering Tc. We chose to stack four bilayers and add a protective
TiN cap layer, which produces Rs = 20 Ω /(cid:3) and Ls =22.5 pH/(cid:3). The TiN/Ti
multilayer effectively reduces the sheet impedance by a factor of four as com-
pared to the TiN/Ti/TiN trilayer ﬁlms used in our previous single-pol devices [4].
This allows us to reduce the absorber width by a factor of four in the new dual-
polarization devices, which is critical to minimize their cross-polar coupling.

Fig. 1 shows the photolithography mask design used to produce

dual-polarization-sensitive MKIDs from these ﬁlms. There are two MKIDs per
spatial pixel, one per linear polarization. Each MKID contains a 5 µm ﬁnger/gap
interdigitated capacitor of total area 0.68 mm2 and a 3.2 µm wide inductor that
spans the length of the 180 µm wide waveguide diameter for a total volume of
154 µm3 and 230 µm3 for the X and Y inductors, respectively. This combination
of L and C produces resonance frequencies near fo ∼ 1 GHz. Each MKID couples
to a 340 µm wide microstrip transmission line (the silicon wafer is the dielectric
and the device box is the ground plane) via an interdigitated coupling ﬁnger of
designed Qc ∼ 40000-50000.

The two inductors within a pixel are orthogonally aligned in order to obtain
dual-polarization-sensitivity. By making the Y-polarization inductor discontinu-
ous, both MKIDs are deﬁned in one device layer without requiring electrical cross-
overs. In electro-magnetic simulations of a simpliﬁed model of just the antennas,
the inherent asymmetry of the design produces a band averaged (1-1.4 THz) co-
polar coupling of 79 (75)% in the continuous (discontinuous) absorbing inductor.
These simulations also suggest the expected cross-polar coupling to be <2%, but
if the vacuum gap between the wafer and the feedhorn/waveguide becomes too
large, other structures in the detector design could begin to produce an additional
cross-pol contribution.

Five-pixel prototype arrays have been fabricated on a 2 f λ (2.5 mm) detector
pitch. An array couples to a matching array of aluminum, direct-machined feed-

horns. The horns are a three step modiﬁed Potter horn that has been designed for
minimized beam asymmetries while achieving a 30% fractional bandwidth [7][8].
The 1.0 THz low edge of the band is deﬁned by waveguide. A quasi-optical low-
pass ﬁlter mounts in front of the feedhorns, which deﬁnes the 1.4 THz high edge of
the passband [9]. We mount this detector package to the cold stage of an adiabatic
demagnetization refrigerator and operate the array at 100 mK in the measurements
described below.

3 Polarization Response and Passbands

Polarization characterization was performed on the prototype array described in
Section 2 in a cryostat that is optically coupled to the room with appropriate quasi-
optical ﬁltering. In addition, a 1.8 mm thick piece of eccosorb MF-110 microwave
absorber was installed to decrease the optical loading on the detectors, ensuring
their operability when viewing a 300 K thermal load. The microwave absorber
has an anti-reﬂective coating and has a calculated band-averaged transmission of
0.93%. The detectors are coupled to a 1050 C to 20 C chopped thermal source that
underﬁlls the beam of the feedhorns. A rotatable wire grid polarizer which has an
induced cross-pol of less than 0.5% is placed between the chopped source and the
cryostat window. We determine the polarization properties by measuring the am-
plitude of the response of the detectors as a function of the angular position of the
polarizer. The result produces a sinusoidal signal, shown in Fig. 2. We determine
the cross-polar coupling, or the minimum of the amplitude response, by ﬁtting
the data to a sine wave. The results of the ﬁt suggests the detector cross-polar
coupling is 2.6% and 2.8% for the X and Y polarizations, respectively. However,
these values are most likely an upper limit as the ﬁt lies above the minimum data
points (1.7% and 1.9% for X and Y, respectively). Regardless, this result is con-
sistent within the uncertainty of the HFSS simulations for this pixel geometry, and
is an improvement over the 11% cross-polar coupling measured in the previous
experiment[10].

Fig. 2 Polarization Efﬁciency Graph. The data points are the amplitudes of the chopped signal
at each input polarization angle, normalized to the peak signal, while the lines are a ﬁt to the
data. The resulting cross-polar coupling is at most 2.6% and 2.8% for the X and Y polarization
detectors, respectively. (Color ﬁgure online.)

We determine the detector passbands by use of a Fourier Transform Spec-
trometer (FTS), which was purged with nitrogen gas to minimize atmospheric
attenuation. The FTS is coupled to the same 1050 C thermal source used in the
polarization measurements. In this conﬁguration, the source ﬁlls the beam and is
no longer chopped, and the input polarizer is removed. The bandpasses for each X
and Y polarization detector are averaged over multiple FTS scans to reduce spec-
tral noise, and the result is shown in Fig. 3. While the cut-off frequency (1.4 THz),
which is deﬁned by the low-pass ﬁlter, is uniform, there is a clear difference in
cut-on frequencies between the two detector polarizations. The X polarization
cut-on is 1054.1 GHz, while the Y polarization cut-on is 1033.7 GHz. This 20.4
GHz discrepancy in the low frequency edge is likely due to a slightly oval-shaped
waveguide (3.55 microns larger in Y-pol than X-pol), which is produced by using
a standard twist drill bit. To address this problem, the waveguide will be undercut
and reamed to produce a uniform circle at the desired waveguide diameter.

4 Detector Thermal Blackbody Responsivity

We determine the sensitivity to thermal radiation by coupling the detectors to a
beam-ﬁlling temperature-controlled blackbody load. The measurement approach
is identical to that described in Hubmayr et al [4]. While the detectors were held
at a bath temperature of 100 mK, the frequency noise and detector response was
measured as a function of blackbody temperature 3 K to 22 K. Our previous tri-
layer ﬁlms [4] as well as other devices fabricated from TiN [11, 12] show a near
linear responsivity to photon load. We observe the same phenomenon in these
multilayer ﬁlms as seen in Fig. 4. The device responsivity ranges from -20 to -24
ppm/pW for a sample of MKIDs in the 5-pixel array. The frequency noise of the
detector taken at each temperature step is converted to a noise equivalent power

Fig. 3 Detector Bandpasses. The X and Y polarization bandpasses, averaged over multiple FTS
measurements, are corrected for the spectral slope in the transmission of the microwave absorb-
ing ﬁlter. The uniform high frequency cutoff is deﬁned by a low-pass ﬁlter mounted directly on
top of the feedhorns. The low frequency cut-on is deﬁned by the feedhorn waveguide diame-
ter. The non-uniformity in X and Y polarization detectors is due to the slight ellipticity in the
waveguide due to machining techniques and will be addressed in the ﬁnal feedhorn array. (Color

(NEP) by utilizing the local slope of the detector responsivities in Fig. 4. The re-
sults are ﬁtted using a best ﬁt NEP model which accounts for individual sources
of noise. More detail on this can be found in Hubmayr et al [4]. This best ﬁt model
is used to determine a detector optical coupling efﬁciency of ∼75%. These results
also conﬁrm that the multilayer ﬁlms demonstrate photon noise limited sensitivity
above 1 pW of loading.

5 Conclusion

We demonstrate dual-polarization sensitive THz pixels comprised of microwave
kinetic inductance detectors. These detectors have good polarization isolation,
demonstrating a cross-polar coupling of at most 2.6% and 2.8% in the X and
Y polarizations, respectively. In addition, these detectors demonstrate background
limited sensitivity above 1 pW of loading. This work represents a viable path to-
wards production of large arrays of thousands of polarization sensitive MKIDs for
observations in the sub-mm which will be deployed on the BLAST-TNG instru-
ment.
