Abstract

Monitoring multichannel proﬁles has important applications in manufacturing sys-
tems improvement, but it is non-trivial to develop eﬃcient statistical methods due to
two main challenges. First, proﬁles are high-dimensional functional data with intrinsic
inner- and inter-channel correlations, and one needs to develop a dimension reduction
method that can deal with such intricate correlations for the purpose of eﬀective mon-
itoring. The second, and probably more fundamental, challenge is that the functional
structure of multi-channel proﬁles might change over time, and thus the dimension
reduction method should be able to automatically take into account the potential
unknown change. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a novel thresholded
multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) method for multi-channel proﬁle
monitoring. Our proposed method consists of two steps of dimension reduction: It
ﬁrst applies the functional PCA to extract a reasonable large number of features
under the normal operational (in-control) state, and then use the soft-thresholding
techniques to further select signiﬁcant features capturing proﬁle information in the
out-of-control state. The choice of tuning parameter for soft-thresholding is pro-
vided based on asymptotic analysis, and extensive simulation studies are conducted
to illustrate the eﬃcacy of our proposed thresholded PCA methodology.

Introduction

Proﬁle monitoring plays an important role in manufacturing systems improvement (Noorossana

et al. (2011), Qiu (2013)), and a standard setup is to monitor a sequence of proﬁles (e.g.

curves or functions) over time to check whether the underlying functional structure of the

proﬁles changes or not. Extensive research has been done for monitoring univariate proﬁle

or real-valued functions in the area of statistical process control (SPC) in the past decades,

and standard approaches are to reduce the univariate proﬁles in the inﬁnite-dimensional or

high-dimensional functional spaces to a low-dimensional set of features (e.g., shape, magni-

tude, frequency, regression coeﬃcients, etc.). See, for instance, work by Jin and Shi (2000),

Ding et al. (2006), Jeong et al. (2006), Jensen et al. (2008), Berkes et al. (2009), Chicken

et al. (2009), Qiu et al. (2010), Abdel-Salam et al. (2013).

Nowadays manufacturing systems are often equipped with a variety of sensors capable

of collecting several proﬁle data simultaneously, and thus one often faces the problem of

monitoring multichannel or multivariate proﬁles that have rich information about systems

performance. A concrete motivating example of this paper is from a forging process, shown

in Figure 1 and 2, in which multichannel load proﬁles measure exerted forces in each column

of the forging machine. Here each data is a four-dimensional vector function or four curves

that have similar but not identical shapes when the machine is operating under the normal

state. While various methods have been developed for univariate proﬁle monitoring, they

often cannot easily be extended to multichannel proﬁles, and research on monitoring multi-

variate/mutichannel nonlinear proﬁles is very limited. For some exceptions, see Jeong et al.

(2007), Paynabar et al. (2013), Grasso et al. (2014), and Paynabar et al. (2016). There are

two main challenges when monitoring multichannel proﬁles. The ﬁrst one is that proﬁles

are high-dimensional functions with intrinsic inner- and inter-channel correlations, and one

needs to develop a dimension reduction method that can deal with such intricate correla-

2

tions. The second, probably more fundamental, challenge is that the functional structure

of multi-channel proﬁles might change over time, and thus the dimension reduction method

should be able to take into account the potential unknown change.

The primary goal of this paper is to develop an eﬀective statistical method for monitor-

ing multichannel proﬁles. Our methodology is inspired by the functional Principal Compo-

nent Analysis (PCA), which has been successfully applied by Paynabar et al. (2013), Grasso

et al. (2014), and Paynabar et al. (2016) to deal with intrinsic inner- and inter-channel cor-

relations of proﬁles. These existing methods follow the standard PCA approach to select

a few principal components (projections or eigenvectors) that contain a large amount of

variation or information in the proﬁle data under the normal operational (in-control) state.

This kind of dimension reduction approach might be reasonable from the estimation or

curve ﬁtting/smoothing viewpoint under the normal operation state, but unfortunately

it is ineﬀective in the context of process monitoring, especially for multivariate or multi-

channel proﬁles. This is because it does not reﬂect the possible change or fail to capture

the proﬁle information under the out-of-control state. Here we propose to develop a PCA

method that can automatically take into account the potential unknown change.

Note that there are two diﬀerent phases of proﬁle monitoring: one is Phase I for oﬄine

analysis when a retrospective data set is used to estimate and reﬁne the underlying model

and its parameters, and the other is Phase II when the estimated model in Phase I is

used for online process monitoring. Here we focus on the Phase I analysis, and hopefully

our results can shed new light for Phase II monitoring of multichannel proﬁles as well. In

addition, we should acknowledge that the importance of dimension reduction and feature

selection for high-dimensional data via thresholding or shrinkage is well-known in modern

statistics, including the proﬁle monitoring literature. Jeong et al. (2006) incorporated the

hard thresholding into the Hotelling T 2 statistics in the context of online monitoring of

single proﬁles, and Jeong et al. (2007) proposed a hard thresholding method to obtain

3

projection information by optimizing “overall relative reconstruction error”. Zou et al.

(2012) applied LASSO shrinkage in linear model coeﬃcients for online monitoring linear

proﬁles problem. However, these existing methods use thresholding or shrinkage to conduct

one-shot dimension reduction, whereas our proposed methodology splits the dimension

reduction process into two steps using two diﬀerent methods: PCA for the normal operation

or in-control state, and soft-thresholding for the out-of-control state.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2, we present the

mathematical formulation of multichannel proﬁle monitoring.

In Section 3, we propose

our thresholded PCA method, and provide a guideline on how to select the corresponding

tuning parameters. In Section 4, we use the real forging process data and simulations to

illustrate the usefulness of our proposed thresholded PCA method. Concluding remarks

and future research directions are presented in Section 5.

2 Problem Formulation and Background

Suppose that a random sample of m multichannel proﬁles, each with p channels, is collected

from a production process. Mathematically, each of the m multichannel proﬁle observations
(t))T , where t ∈ [0, 1], for
is a p-dimensional curve denoted by Xi(t) = (X (1)
i = 1,··· , m. We assume that the process is initially in-control and at some unknown time
τ, the process may become out-of-control in the sense of the mean shifts of the proﬁles

(t), ..., X (p)

i

i

Xi(t)’s. Speciﬁcally, we assume that the data are from the change-point additive noise

model

Xi(t) =

 µ1(t) + Yi(t), when i = 1, ..., τ,

µ2(t) + Yi(t), when i = τ + 1, ..., m,

for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1,

(1)

for some unknown 0 ≤ τ < m, where the Yi(t)’s are independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) p-dimensional “noise” curves with mean 0, i.e., Yi(t) = (Y(1)
i (t))T and

i (t),··· , Y(p)

4

E(Y(j)

i (t)) = 0 for all dimension j = 1,··· , p and for all observations i = 1,··· , m.
In Phase I proﬁle monitoring, µ1(t) and µ2(t) are two unknown p-dimensional mean
functions, and we want to utilize the observed Xi(t)’s to test the null hypothesis H0 :
µ1(t) = µ2(t) (i.e., no change) against the alternative hypothesis Ha : µ1(t) (cid:54)= µ2(t) (i.e.,
a change occurs at some unknown time 0 ≤ τ < m).
In addition, we also impose the
classical Type I probability error constraint PH0(reject H0 : µ1(t) = µ2(t)) ≤ α, for some
pre-speciﬁed constant α, e.g., α = 5%.

To test the hypothesis H0 : µ1(t) = µ2(t) under model (1) subject to the Type I
error constraint, it is important to make suitable assumptions of the correlation of both

within and between proﬁle channels. To characterize these correlations, as in Paynabar

et al. (2016), we apply Karhunen-Loeve expansion theorem to the p-dimensional noise

curves Yi(t): there exists a set of orthonormal (orthogonal and unit norm) basis functions
V = {vk(t) ∈ L2[0, 1], k = 1, 2, ...}, such that

Yi(t) =

ξikvk(t),

for i = 1, ..., m,

(2)

where the number of elements of V could be either ﬁnite or inﬁnite, and the coeﬃcient
ξik = (ξik1,··· , ξikp) is a p-dimensional vector. The key assumption we made is that the
coeﬃcients {ξik}’s are i.i.d. p-dimensional random vectors with mean 0 and covariance
matrix Σk over all i = 1,··· , m data points for each base k ∈ V. Under this assumption,
it is evident from (2) that the p × p covariance matrix Σk satisﬁes

(cid:88)

ik) = E{

Σk = E(ξikξT

(cid:90) 1

0

Yi(t)vk(t)dt

Yi(t)T vk(t)dt},

(3)

since the basis functions vk(t)’s are orthonormal for each k ∈ V.

It is useful to brieﬂy discuss the eﬀect of (2) on the correlations of multichannel proﬁles.

As in the standard functional data analysis, the real-valued basis functions vk(t)’s are closely

related to the inner-channel correlation of the proﬁles. Meanwhile, since the p-dimensional

5

curve is decomposed into the same real-valued basis functions vk(t)’s in (2), the inter-

channel correlations of the p-channel proﬁles are characterized by the correlation matrices
Σk’s in (3) of the coeﬃcients {ξik}’s. In practice, both the basis functions vk(t)’s and the
covariance matrices Σk’s are unknown and needed to be estimated, see the next section.

3 Our Proposed Thresholded PCA Methodology

In this section, we develop a thresholded multivariate functional PCA methodology for

Phase I monitoring of multichannel proﬁles. For the purpose of easy understanding, this

section is subdivided into three subsections. In Subsection 3.1, we review the multivariate

functional PCA method that estimates the basis vk(t)’s in (2) and the covariance matrices

Σk’s in (3). This allows us to reduce the data from the space of p-dimensional proﬁles

Xi(t)’s to the space of the coeﬃcients ξik’s in (2) under the normal operational or in-
control state. In Subsection 3.2, our proposed method is developed as a hypothesis test for

the change-point model in (1) augmented by soft-thresholding technique that has a nature

semi-Bayesian interpretation and is closely related to the generalized likelihood ratio test.

Here the soft-thresholding selects signiﬁcant coeﬃcients ξik’s in (2) that are likely aﬀected
by the change, and thus can be thought of as a further dimension reduction under the out-

of-control state. In Subsection 3.3, based on asymptotic analysis, we provide a guidance

on the choice of tuning parameters in our proposed thresholded PCA methodology.

3.1 Basis and Covariance Estimation

To have a better understanding of the basis and covariance matrix estimation under the

change-point model in (1), we ﬁrst consider the estimation under the unrealistic case when

the noise functions Yi(t)’s in (2) were observable. Recall that the p-dimensional functions

Yi(t)’s are decomposed into the same real-valued basis functions vk(t)’s in (2), this mo-

6

tivates us to evaluate the inner-channel correlation of Yi(t)’s by the following covariance

function:

c(t, s) = Cov{Yi(t), Yi(s)} =

p(cid:88)

j=1

E(Y (j)

i

(t) · Y (j)

i

(s))

for 0 ≤ t, s ≤ 1,

(4)

since Yi(t) is a p-dimensional function with mean 0. When p = 1, the covariance function

c(t, s) in (4) is well studied, and it is well-known that the bases vk(t)’s are the eigenfunctions

c(t, s) =(cid:80)∞

(cid:80)p

of c(t, s). Below we will show that similar conclusions also hold under our deﬁnition of the
covariance function c(t, s) in (4) for the general p ≥ 2 case.

ikj]vk(t)vk(s), and(cid:82) 1

To see this, since the basis functions vk(t)’s are orthonormal, it follows from (2) that
j=1 E[ξ2
and ξikj is the j-th component of the p-dimensional random vector ξik for j = 1,··· , p.
Hence, the basis vk(t)’s are the eigenfunctions of c(t, s) for any dimension p ≥ 2.

0 c(t, s)vk(s)ds = λkvk(t), where λk =(cid:80)p

k=1

j=1 E[ξ2

ikj],

It suﬃces to estimate the covariance function c(t, s) in (4) from the observable proﬁles

Xi(t). While the noise terms Yi(t)’s are unobservable, a good news of the change-point
additive noise model in (1) is that the diﬀerences Yi+1(t) − Yi(t) = Xi+1(t) − Xi(t) are
observable for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1 except i = τ (the change-point). Thus the covariance
function c(t, s) in (4) can be estimated by Yi+1(t)− Yi(t), which yields the approximation:

m−1(cid:88)

i=1

ˆc(t, s) =

1

2(m − 1)

(Xi+1(t) − Xi(t))T (Xi+1(s) − Xi(s)).

(5)

Note that the denominator is 2(m−1), and since the Yi(t)’s are i.i.d. over i = 1,··· , m, the
estimated function ˆc(t, s) in (5) is consistent under the reasonable regularity assumption

of the alternative hypothesis, see Remark #2 in Paynabar et al. (2016).

Next, the estimates of basis functions ˆvk(t)’s can be found as the eigenfunctions of ˆc(t, s)

in (5). As for the estimation of the covariance matrix Σk in (3) of coeﬃcients ξik, we again
take advantage of the diﬀerences Yi+1(t) − Yi(t) under the change-point additive noise

7

model in (1), and approximate it by

ˆΣk =

{Xi+1(t) − Xi(t)}T ˆvk(t)dt.

(6)

We follow the standard PCA literature to focus on the ﬁrst d largest eigenvalues of the

function ˆc(t, s) in (5), and consider the corresponding d eigenfunctions ˆvk(t)’s. However,

our choice of the actual value of d will be diﬀerent here. From the dimension reduction

viewpoint, the standard PCA methods often reduce the data directly to a low-dimensional

space, and thus the value of d is often chosen to be relatively small. Meanwhile, for our

proposed method, the dimension reduction process is split into two steps that correspond to

the normal operation state and the out-of-control state, respectively. The PCA is used only

in the ﬁrst step to reduce the data from the inﬁnitely functional (or super-high-dimensional)

space to an intermediate space of Rd, which will be further reduced to a lower-dimensional

space in the second step. As a result, the number d of the chosen principal components of

the PCA can be moderately large for our proposed method, e.g., ﬁfties or hundreds.

3.2 Thresholded PCA for Monitoring

We are ready to present our proposed method that utilizes the observed proﬁles Xi(t)’s

to test H0 : µ1(t) = µ2(t) under the change-point additive noise model (1). Intuitively,
it is natural to construct a test statistic based on the estimation of µ1(t) − µ2(t). This
suggests us to compare the diﬀerence of proﬁle sample means before and after a potential
change-point (cid:96) = 1, 2, ..., m − 1,

∆(cid:96)(t) =

Here the term(cid:112)(cid:96)(m − (cid:96))/m scales the diﬀerence and standardizes the variance of proﬁle

diﬀerence. Note that the function ∆(cid:96)(t) in (7) would have mean 0 when H0 : µ1(t) = µ2(t)
is true, but have non-zero mean under Ha : µ1(t) (cid:54)= µ2(t) when (cid:96) = τ (the change-point).

Next, with the estimated orthonormal basis ˆvk(t)’s and estimated covariance matrix
ˆΣk in (6), we apply the PCA decomposition in (2) to the function ∆(cid:96)(t) in (7). This
essentially projects the test statistics from the functional space to a d-dimensional space

under the normal operational or in-control state. Speciﬁcally, for each candidate change-
point (cid:96) = 1, 2, ..., m − 1, deﬁne the projection to each of the ﬁrst d principal components,

0 ∆(cid:96)(t)ˆvk(t)dt, and then compute the corresponding real-valued statistic

for k = 1, 2,··· , d, where ˆΣk is deﬁned in (6).

H0 : µ1(t) = µ2(t) but η(cid:96)k ∼ N ((cid:82) 1

Note that the statistics U(cid:96),k’s in (8) are motivated from the scenario when the basis
if the estimates ˆvk(t) and ˆΣk are replaced by their true values,
νk(t) and Σk are known:
it is straightforward from (1) to show that η(cid:96)k ∼ N (0, Σk) under the null hypothesis
0 ∆(cid:96)(t)vk(t)dt, Σk) under the alternative hypothesis
Ha : µ1(t) (cid:54)= µ2(t). Hence, when the basis νk(t) and Σk are known, the U(cid:96),k’s in (8) are
χ2
p-distributed under H0 but should be stochastically larger than χ2
p under Ha. When the
estimates ˆvk(t) and ˆΣk are used, we expect that similar conclusions also hold approximately,
e.g., whether the value of U(cid:96),k in (8) is large or small indicates whether there is a change

along the principal component ˆvk(t) or not.

Finally, our proposed thresholded PCA methodology considers the soft-thresholding

transformation of the U(cid:96),k’s in (8), so as to smooth out those noisy principal component

ˆvk(t)’s that do not provide information about the change under the out-of-control state.

To be more rigorous, we propose a test statistic deﬁned by

d(cid:88)

k=1

Qm = max
1≤(cid:96)<m

(U(cid:96),k − c)+,

(9)

for some pre-speciﬁed “soft-thresholding” parameter c ≥ 0. Here (u − c)+ = max(u − c, 0).

9

Then we reject the null hypothesis H0 : µ1(t) = µ2(t) if and only if

for some pre-determined threshold L. The choices of the constants c and L will be discussed

Qm > L

(10)

in more detail in the next section. When Qm > L, we not only claim that there exists a

change point, but also can estimate the change point by
(U(cid:96),k − c)+.

ˆτ = arg max
1≤(cid:96)<m

d(cid:88)

k=1

(11)

It is informative to provide some high-level insights of the test statistic Qm in (9). Since

we do not know the true change-point τ, it is natural to maximize (9) over all candidate
change-points τ = (cid:96) for 1 ≤ (cid:96) < m from the maximum likelihood estimation or generalized
likelihood ratio test viewpoints. The summation of the soft-thresholding transformation
(U(cid:96),k − c)+ in (9) is more fundamental and can be interpreted from the following semi-
Bayesian viewpoint. For a given candidate change-point (cid:96), let Zk be the indicator whether

the k-th principal component is aﬀected by the change in the out-of-control state or not,

for k = 1, . . . , d. Assume that all principal components are independent, and each has

a prior probability π getting aﬀected by the changing event. That is, assume that the

changing indicators Z1, . . . , Zd are iid with probability mass function P(Zk = 1) = π =
1 − P(Zk = 0). When Zk = 1, the k-th principal component is aﬀected, and U(cid:96),k in (8)
represents the evidence of possible change in the log-likelihood-ratio scale. Treating Zk’s

as the hidden states, and then the joint log-likelihood ratio statistic of Zk’s and Xk,n when

LLR(n) =

k=1

testing H0 : Z1 = . . . = Zd = 0 (no change) is

{Zk(log π + U(cid:96),k) + (1 − Zk) log(1 − π)} − d(cid:88)

d(cid:88)
which becomes(cid:80)d
k=1 Zk{U(cid:96),k−log((1−π)/π)}. Since the Zk’s are unobservable, it is natural
becomes(cid:80)d
to maximize LLR(n) over Z1, . . . , Zd ∈ {0, 1}. Hence, the generalized log-likelihood ratio
k=1 max{U(cid:96),k − log((1 − π)/π), 0}, which is exactly our test statistic Qm in (9).

log(1 − π),

k=1

10

We should acknowledge that from the mathematical viewpoint, the multivariate func-

tional PCA-based monitoring method in Paynabar et al. (2016) is the special case of Qm

in (9) when the soft-thresholding parameter c = 0, which is reasonable in that context be-

cause the number d of principal components is small (e.g., d = 15). However, our proposed

method is a non-trivial extension of Paynabar et al. (2016) from the statistical or dimension

reduction viewpoint: we consider a moderately large value d of principal components (e.g.,

d = 45), and a suitable choice of the soft-thresholding parameter c > 0 in (9) is essential

to conduct another level of dimension reduction to smooth out those principal components

that do not provide information of the change under the out-of-control state.

3.3 The Choices of Tuning Parameters

There are two tuning parameters in our proposed thresholded PCA methodology based on

the test statistic Qm in (9): one is the soft-thresholding parameter c in (9), and the other

is the threshold L in (10). Practically, one needs to determine c ﬁrst before selecting L,

but below we will present the choice of L ﬁrst for a given c since it is easier to understand

from the statistical viewpoint.

In order to ﬁnd the threshold L for our proposed methodology to satisfy the Type I

error probability constraint, assume, for now, that the constant c in (9) is given. Then
the constraint becomes PH0(Qm > L) ≤ α. Hence, the threshold L should be the upper α
quantile of the distribution of Qm in (9) for a given c under H0, which can be simulated by

Monte Carlo method based on normal proﬁles and models, see Paynabar et al. (2016).

Let us now discuss the choice of soft-thresholding parameter c in (9). The baseline

choice of c is c0 = 0, which yields the approach of Paynabar et al. (2016) for the scenario

when the number d of selected principal components is small. Intuitively, when the number

d of principal components are large, the soft-thresholding parameter c > 0 in (9) should

be large enough to ﬁlter out those non-changing bases ˆvk(t)’s, but cannot be too large to

11

remove some changing principal components and lower the signal-to-noise ratios. Hence, a

suitable choice of c will depend on the speciﬁc Ha and its eﬀects on the basis projections.

Below we will discuss two diﬀerent heuristic choices of the soft-thresholding parameter

(cid:96)=1

k=1

(U(cid:96),k − c)+ > L) ≤ P(Qm > L) ≤ m−1(cid:88)

d(cid:88)
which becomes (m − 1)P((cid:80)d
Hence, from the asymptotic viewpoint, P(Qm > L) and P((cid:80)d
to 0, the main probability of interest is to estimate PH0((cid:80)d
methods to approximate the distribution of(cid:80)d

k=1(U(cid:96),k − c)+ > L), as the data are iid over (cid:96) = 1,··· , m − 1.
k=1(U(cid:96),k − c)+ > L) go to 0
at the same rate when m is ﬁxed. In particular, when the Type I error constraint α goes
k=1(U(cid:96),k − c)+ > Lc), where Lc
is chosen so that this probably ≤ α. Our proposed choices of c correspond to two diﬀerent
k=1(U(cid:96),k − c)+ under H0 : one is the central
limit theorem (CLT) when c is small, and the other is the extreme theorem when c is

(12)

large. Since these two methods yield diﬀerent results on c, we present them separately in

Proposition 1, which assumes that χ2

Proof: Due to page limit, let us only provide a sketch of the proof. In part (a), the c1

value maximizes the power of the test under Ha subject to the Type I error constraint α,

and the CLT is used to approximate error probabilities. That is the reason why we need

some prior information on d0 and δ under Ha. In our numerical studies, when such prior

information of Ha is not available, our experiences suggest that δ = 1 and d0 = d/3 yield

a good robust result under our simulation numerical setting.

4 Case Study

In this section, we apply our proposed thresholded PCA method to the real forging manu-

facturing process dataset in Figures 1 and 2 in the Introduction. This dataset includes 207

normal proﬁles under the in-control state and 69 diﬀerent fault proﬁles under the out-of-

control state. It was analyzed in Paynabar et al. (2016) whose method can be thought of

as the special case of our proposed method with the speciﬁc soft-thresholding parameter

c0 = 0. Below the choice of c0 = 0 will be regarded as the baseline method, and we will focus

on whether the values of c1 and c2 in Proposition 1 for the soft-thresholding parameter c

in (9) can improve the performance or not as compared to the baseline value c0 = 0.

First, we consider a speciﬁc case study setting in Paynabar et al. (2016) where 207

normal proﬁles are followed by the 69 fault proﬁles, i.e., the change-point τ = 207 for the

change-point model in (1), and the baseline method c0 = 0 can successfully detect the true

change-point. Our experiences show that our proposed method with either c1 or c2 can also

correctly detect the change-point. In other words, if the change is signiﬁcantly large, then

all reasonable proﬁle monitoring algorithms, including our proposed methods with any of

the three c values in (9), will be able to detect the change correctly.

Below we will conduct extensive simulation studies that focus on detecting smaller

changes. For better presentation, the remainder of this section is divided into two subsec-

tions. In subsection 4.1, we use the real proﬁles and B-splines to present the generative
models of proﬁles under the in-control state and 2 × 3 × 7 = 42 diﬀerent out-of-control
states. This allows us to generate observed proﬁles Xi(t)’s from the change-point addi-

tive noise model in (1).

In subsection 4.2, our proposed thresholded PCA methods are

applied to the generated proﬁles Xi(t)’s, and the performance of the values of c1 and c2 in

Proposition 1 is then compared with that of the baseline value c0 = 0.

4.1 Proﬁle Generative Models

Let us provide a high-level description of our simulation setting. In each run of our sim-

ulation studies below, we generate m = 200 proﬁles from the change-point model in (1)

with change-point τ = 100, i.e., the ﬁrst 100 proﬁles, X1(t), ..., X100(t), are generated from

the in-control state, and the last 100 proﬁles, X101(t), ..., X200(t) are generated from one

of the 42 out-of-control states. For each set of m = 200 simulated proﬁles, our proposed

thresholded PCA method with three diﬀerent soft-thresholding parameters c0, c1, c2, are

applied to see whether they are able to correctly detect the change τ = 100 or not. This

process is repeated for 200 times, and the average performances are reported and compared

for three diﬀerent parameters c0, c1, c2. It is important to emphasize that the generative

models below are only used to generate the m = 200 observable proﬁles Xi(t)’s. Our pro-

posed thresholded PCA methods are applied to those m = 200 proﬁles, and do not use any

information or knowledge of these proﬁle generative models.

For the generative models for proﬁles under the in-control state, we propose to build

such a model by applying B-splines to the 207 normal proﬁles, X1(t), ..., X207(t), in the real

forging dataset. To be more speciﬁc, we generate an unevenly spaced set of 66 B-spline

basis in [0, 1], and after orthogonalization and normalization we obtain basis B1(t), ..., B66(t)

using the “orthogonalsplinebasis” Package in the free statistical software R 3.1.2. Based

on our experiences, the choice of 66 basis yields the best tradeoﬀ to balance the ﬁtting of

normal proﬁles and the computational simplicity, but it can easily be changed to another

number. Then our proposed generative model for normal proﬁles is of the form

66(cid:88)

(cid:101)θiBi(t),

where the 4-dimensional vectors(cid:101)θi’s are assumed to be multivariate normally distributed

i=1

X(t) =

(15)

with parameters estimated from the observed 207 normal proﬁles, see Figure 3.

15

For proﬁles under the out-of-control (OC) state, we assume that the generative OC

of 2 × 3 × 7 = 42 diﬀerent OC cases, depending on three diﬀerent factors. First, we
consider two diﬀerent scenarios, depending on how many components/channels of the 4-

model is the same as (15) but the means of (cid:101)θi’s might change. We will consider a total
dimensional random vector ((cid:101)θ(1)
and(cid:101)θ(2)
(cid:101)θ(1)
which subset of the 66 diﬀerent(cid:101)θi in the model (15) changes their means, or equivalently,

i have OC mean (our proposed methods are not designed for Scenario B, and we
run simulation to see their performance). Second, we consider three cases, depending on

i ) are involved with the change: (A) All 4
components/channels have new OC mean; and (B) Only the ﬁrst 2 components/channels,

which location or interval of [0, 1] changes at the original proﬁle scale: (I) a local change for
30 ≤ i ≤ 37; (II) a local change for 16 ≤ i ≤ 29 and (III) a global change for all 1 ≤ i ≤ 66.
In the context of the original proﬁles, the locations of these three changes occur over

intervals 200

400 ≤ t ≤ 300

400, 99

400 ≤ t ≤ 149

400 and 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, respectively. Finally, we consider

seven diﬀerent magnitude values, so as to have reasonable detection powers regardless of

the locations of the change. In particular, when the real-valued mean of(cid:101)θ(j)

’s changes from
θi to θi + 0.005 + 0.005 ∗ ∆, we set ∆ = h + 1 for local change in Case (I), ∆ = h for local
change in Case (II), and ∆ = 0.1 ∗ h for global change in case (III). Here there are seven
values of h : h = 1, 2,··· , 7. Note that given the same magnitude of the change, it is the
most diﬃcult to detect the local change of Case (I) (where the peak of the proﬁle occurs),

i

and it is the easiest to detect the global change of Case (III). Here we assign diﬀerent

magnitudes so that the detection powers of these cases are comparable. In summary, there
are 2 × 3 × 7 = 42 OC cases depending on the channel, location, and magnitude of the
changes, and all numerical values are inspired from the real forging dataset.

16

4.2 Performance Comparison

In this subsection, we report the performance of our proposed thresholded PCA method

with three diﬀerent choices of the soft-thresholding parameter c, and our objective is to see

whether the c1 and c2 in Proposition 1 will yield a better performance as compared to the
baseline c0 = 0 in the sense of detecting those 2 × 3 × 7 = 42 OC cases.

In order to have a fair comparison, we ﬁx the number of principal components as d = 45

for all three choices of soft-thresholding c values, since on average that will explain more

than 90% of the proﬁles variance. In addition, for each method, we choose the threshold L in

(10) to satisfy Type I error constraint α = 0.05. Also our proposed methods were developed

under the assumption that all 4 components/channels are aﬀected, and the magnitudes of

the changes are unknown. Table 1 lists the speciﬁc values of c0, c1, c2 used in our study.

Note that the value of c0 = 0 and c2 do not depend on the location of the change, but the

value of c1 depends on the location of the change.

Figure 4 plots the detection power of our proposed methods with three diﬀerent choices

of soft-thresholding c values as functions of change magnitudes when all 4 components/channels

of θi are actually changed simultaneously. The top panel deals with the OC-case (I) where

a local change aﬀects the rise, peak, and fall segments of the proﬁles, and all three methods

seem to have comparable detection powers, although c0 = 0 is slightly worse. The middle

panel shows that under the OC case (II), both c1 and c2 can greatly improve the detection

power as compared with the baseline c0 = 0, especially when the change magnitude is small
(e.g., h ≤ 5). For large change magnitudes, all three methods have detection power close
to 1, implying that all reasonable methods should be able to detect large changes.

A surprising observation of Figure 4 is the bottom panel that considers the OC case

(III) when a global change occurs over [0, 1]. Intuitively, for a global change, one would

expect that the change aﬀects all principal components and hence thresholding might not

help. However, the bottom panel of Figure 4 is counter-intuitive, as both c1 and c2 seem to

17

yield a larger detection power than c0 = 0, especially for small magnitude h. To gain a deep

understanding, Figure 5 plots the box plot of U(cid:96)=100,k under the both IC and OC-case(III)

states for all d = 45 principal components. From the box plots, for the global change, it is

surprising that almost half of U(cid:96),k’s have a similar or smaller median value under OC than

IC. We feel that this is the reason why soft-thresholding help improve the detection power

in the global change case, as it can ﬁlter out those U(cid:96),k’s that have smaller OC values.

We also evaluate the performance of our proposed method in terms of estimating the

change-point τ . When the true τ = 100 is estimated as ˆτ , we consider three diﬀerent
measures: E(|ˆτ − τ|), P (|τ − ˆτ| ≤ 1) (denoted by P1) and P (|τ − ˆτ| ≤ 3) (denoted by
P3). Table 2 reports the Monte Carlo simulation results under these three criteria based

on 200 runs.

In general all three values c0, c1 and c2 yield comparable results in terms

of estimating τ, and it is interesting to note that the thresholding values c1 and c2 often

have larger P1 and P3 than the baseline c0 = 0 for the OC case (II) with the local-mean

shift cases. This suggests that thresholding might be able to locate the small, local change
more precisely. One “strange” observation in Table 2 is that E(|ˆτ − τ|) is not necessarily
monotone as a function of the change magnitude h. We do not have a deep insight, and
one possible explanation is because |ˆτ − τ| takes on the integer values, 0, 1, 2,··· , 100, since
both are integers.

Figure 6 plots the detection power of our proposed methods when only 2 out of 4

channels/components are aﬀected. It is clear from the top and middle panels of Figure 6

that the c1 and c2 values greatly outperforms the baseline c0 = 0 value for almost all shift

magnitudes in the OC case of local changes. In the bottom panel for the OC case (III)

of the global change, the detection power improvement is signiﬁcant for c2 as compared to

the baseline c0 = 0. We feel this might be due to the new spatial sparsity where the proﬁle

means of only two channels have shifted. While our proposed thresholded PCA method

is not designed speciﬁcally for the spatial sparsity, the thresholding can actually take care

18

of spatial sparsity to yield better detection power. In addition, as compared to Figure 4,

Figure 6 implies that the detection powers when only 2 out of 4 components have changed

are less than those when all 4 components have changed.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we proposed a thresholded multivariate PCA for multichannel proﬁle mon-

itoring. Our proposed method essentially conducts dimension reduction in two steps: We

ﬁrst apply multivariate PCA to reduce high dimensional multichannel proﬁles to a reason-

able number of features under the normal operational state, and then use soft-thresholding

techniques to further select informative features under the out-of-control state. We also

give several suggestions on how to select tuning parameters based on asymptotic analysis.

Moreover, we used real forging process dataset and B-splines to build generative methods
for multichannel proﬁles under the in-control state and 2 × 3 × 7 = 42 diﬀerent out-of-
control states. Our numerical studies demonstrate that the soft-thresholding technique can

signiﬁcantly increase the detection power as compared to the baseline value c0 = 0.

There are a number of interesting problems that have not been addressed here. From

the theoretical point of view, it will be useful to investigate the eﬃciency of our proposed

methods, and to ﬁnd an optimal value of soft-thresholding parameter c that can adaptively

adjust for diﬀerent out-of-control states. Another direction is to investigate how to extend

our proposed method to Phase II online proﬁle monitoring. That will be more challenging,

partly because it is more diﬃcult to select informative principal components due to fewer

out-of-control proﬁles since one observes proﬁles one at a time. Therefore, our research

should be interpreted as a starting point for further investigation.

Note: All our proposed methods were developed under the assumption that all 4

components/channels are aﬀected, and the magnitudes of the changes are unknown. Table

1 lists the speciﬁc values of c0, c1, c2 used in our study. Note that the value of c0 = 0 and c2

do not depend on the location of the change, but the value of c1 depends on the location

of the change.

Note that when computing the c1 value in Proposition 1, we need to know the value

of d0, the number of aﬀected principal components that are relevant to the change among

a total of d = 45 principal components. Here the value d0 is chosen by the following
(cid:96),k {k = 1, ..., d}’s under H0 using the simulated in-
data-driven method: We ﬁrst obtain U H0
control proﬁles and record the value A as the top 10% value of U H0
(cid:96),k ’s. Then, we compute
(cid:96),k {k = 1, ..., d}’s under H1 using simulated out-of-control proﬁles, and count how many
U H1
U H1
(cid:96),k ’s are greater than such threshold A. This gives an estimate of d0 since it indicates the
number of altered U(cid:96),k’s if a speciﬁc fault occurs. For the purpose of easy computation and

comparison, the out-of-control scenario was conducted when all 4 components of aﬀected

θi are changed, and the same d0 and c1 values were used in the scenario when only 2 out

4 components are changed.

We feel that this is the reason why soft-thresholding can improve the detection power in

Figure 6: When only 2 out of 4 channels/components are aﬀected. The three plots corre-

spond to three OC cases, depending on which subset of the 66 diﬀerent (cid:101)θi in the model

(15) changes their means. Upper: case (I) with a local change for 30 ≤ i ≤ 37; Medium:
case (II) with a local change for 16 ≤ i ≤ 29 and Bottom: case (III) with a global change
for all 1 ≤ i ≤ 66. In each ﬁgure, each curve represents our proposed method with a speciﬁc
soft-thresholding c values: Red line with circle (c0); blue line with square (c1); and black

line with star (c2). The detection power of each method is plotted as the function of the 7

diﬀerent change magnitudes.
