The concept of ﬂat band plays an important role in strongly-correlated many-body physics. How-
ever, the demonstration of the ﬂat band physics is highly nontrivial due to intrinsic limitations
in conventional condensed matter materials. Here we propose a circuit quantum electrodynamics
simulator of the 2D Lieb lattice exhibiting a ﬂat middle band. By exploiting the simple paramet-
ric conversion method, we design a photonic Lieb lattice with in situ tunable hopping strengths
in a 2D array of coupled superconducting transmissionline resonators. Moreover, the ﬂexibility of
our proposal enables the immediate incorporation of both the artiﬁcial gauge ﬁeld and the strong
photon-photon interaction in a time- and site-resolved manner. To unambiguously demonstrate the
synthesized ﬂat band, we further investigate the observation of the ﬂat band localization of mi-
crowave photons through the pumping and the steady-state measurements of only few sites on the
lattice. Requiring only current level of technique and being robust against imperfections in realistic
circuits, our scheme can be readily tested in experiments and may pave a new way towards the
future realization of exotic photonic quantum Hall ﬂuids including anomalous quantum Hall eﬀect
and bosonic fractional quantum Hall states without magnetic ﬁelds.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum particles in a periodical crystal normally
move freely except for a renormalized eﬀective mass de-
ﬁned by the band dispersion. However, there exist struc-
tures exhibiting a completely ﬂat band (FB) with an
inﬁnitely large eﬀective mass [1, 2]. As the kinetic en-
ergy is quenched, the interaction becomes crucial, mak-
ing the FB an ideal platform of investigating strongly-
correlated many-body physics including ferromagnetism,
Wigner crystals, and fractional quantum Hall states in
the absence of magnetic ﬁeld [3–6]. Nevertheless, despite
the extensive eﬀorts in the past decades, the proposed
FB physics can still hardly be achieved in conventional
electronic systems due to realistic reasons, e.g. the con-
straints of materials, the lack of controllability, and the
co-existing complicated mechanisms.

Meanwhile,

in recent years there have been ideas
emerged that the similar lattice conﬁgurations can be
built in controllable artiﬁcial photonic metamaterials
[7–13]. Compared with their electronic counterparts,
these photonic simulators provide not only the same FB
but also diﬀerent non-equilibrium charge-neutral bosonic
properties, leading to both new physics and new chal-
lenges in theories and experiments. Motivated by these
advances, in this manuscript we propose a circuit quan-
tum dynamics (QED) simulator [14–17] of the Lieb lat-
tice, which is one of the most celebrated and important
2D lattices with FB conﬁguration [18]. Here the lat-

tice is constructed by superconducting transmissionline
resonators (TLRs) coupled by superconducting quantum
inteference devices (SQUIDs) [19–21], and the electrons
are substituted by the microwave photons. While the
photonic Lieb lattice has already been realized recently
in the context of photonic crystal with the FB localiza-
tion of non-interacting photons been observed [9, 10], this
proposal takes the advantages of ﬂexibility and tunabil-
ity of superconducting quantum circuit (SQC). The ﬁrst
distinct merit of our scheme is that we synthesize the
photon hopping by the parametric frequency conversion
(PFC) approach, which is simple in experimental setup
and feasible with current technology [20–23]. This PFC
method can lead to the unprecedented in situ tunable
hopping strength, making the introduction of synthetic
gauge ﬁelds for the neutral photons readily possible. In
addition, the strong coupling between superconducting
qubits and TLRs [14, 15] allows the immediate incorpo-
ration of eﬀective photon-photon interactions, which is
critical for strongly-correlated physics and has already at-
tracted attentions in the very latest research of FB in 1D
[11–13]. We further study the observation of localization-
in-continuum modes in this architecture. Our discussions
and numerical simulations based on realistic parameters
pinpoint that, even in the presence of the various im-
perfection factors, a rather ﬂat band structure can be
obtained and consequently the proposed FB localization
can be observed through the steady-state photon number
(SSPN) detection of only few sites on the lattice, which
reveals unambiguously the synthetic FB feature.

II. THE CIRCUIT QED LIEB LATTICE

2

Here we propose the circuit QED lattice shown in
Fig. 1(a) as the SQC realization of the Lieb lattice, which
consists of three types of TLRs diﬀered by their lengths
and placed in an interlaced bricklayer form. These TLRs
play the corresponding roles of the A, B, and C sites
of the line-centered-square lattice depicted in Fig. 1(b).
At their ends, the TLRs are grounded by SQUIDs with
eﬀective inductances much smaller than those of the
TLRs. Due to their very small inductances, the ground-
ing SQUIDs impose the low-voltage shortcut boundary
conditions for the TLRs [19–21]. The lowest eigenmodes
of the lattice can then be approximated by the individual
λ/2 modes of the TLRs, and the lattice can be described
by the Hamiltonian

HS =

ωAA†

(cid:88)

r

where α†
r/αr are the creation/annihilation operators of
the αth site in the rth unit-cell for α = A, B, C, and
ωα are their eigenfrequencies. Hereafter we specify
(ωA, ωB, ωC) = (ω0, ω0 − ∆, ω0 + 2∆) with ω0/2π ∈
[10, 15] GHz and ∆/2π ∈ [1, 2] GHz. Such conﬁguration
is for the following application of the PFC method and
can be experimentally realized through the length selec-
tion of the TLRs in the millimeter range [22–25]. We
refer to Appendix. A for detailed characterization of the
eigenmodes and the estimation of the circuit parameters.
We further consider the implementation of the eﬀective

photon hopping on the lattice, taking the general form

(cid:88)

r,α =(cid:82) r(cid:48),β

r,α is the (r, α) →
in the rotating frame of HS. Here T r(cid:48),β
r,α A(x)·dx is the
(r(cid:48), β) hopping strength, and θr(cid:48),β
(r, α) → (r(cid:48), β) hopping phase manifesting the presence
of an Abelian gauge potential A(x) [26]. For each pla-
quette of the lattice, the loop summation of the hopping
phases can be regarded as the synthesized magnetic ﬁeld

for the microwave photons, i. e. (cid:72) A(x) · dx =(cid:82)(cid:82) B(x) ·

dS. Meanwhile, as the physical coupling between two
TLRs usually takes real coupling constants [27, 28], to
implement the general complex HL we exploit the alter-
native dynamic modulation method [22, 23, 29, 30]. The
grounding SQUIDs can be regarded as tunable induc-
tances which can be a.c. modulated by external mag-
netic ﬂux oscillating at very high frequencies [30]. Such
a.c. modulation introduces a small fraction

in addition to the d.c.
contribution of the grounding
SQUIDs which proves to be irrelevant because the neigh-
boring TLRs are largely oﬀ resonant (see Appendix. A).

lattice sites and the grounding SQUIDs induce the coupling

We then assume that the a.c. modulation of the ground-
ing SQUIDs contain two tones with frequencies ∆ and
2∆, which induce the horizontal A ⇔ B and vertical
A ⇔ C PFC bonds by bridging their frequency gaps, re-
spectively. When experiencing this PFC process, the mi-
crowave photons will adopt the phases of the a.c. modu-
lating pulses, leading to the eﬀective controllable complex
hopping constants [20, 29]. Moreover, it can be ﬁgured
out from Fig. 1(a) that each of the vertical and hor-
izontal hopping bonds can be independently controlled
by a modulating tone threaded in one of the grounding
SQUIDs, leading to the site-resolved control of both the
hopping strengths T r(cid:48),β
r,α and the hopping phases θr(cid:48),β
r,α .
Our further estimations show that the hopping strengths
can be designed in the range T r(cid:48),β
r,α /2π ∈ [5, 15] MHz.
The derivation of the described dynamic modulation
method is detailed in Appendix. A, and a set of typical
circuit and modulation parameters is proposed in Tab.
I, which is based on recent experiments of parametric
processes in SQC and will be used for the numerical sim-

ulations throughout this paper.

In addition, we should mention that the proposed lat-
tice is not limited by the Lieb lattice conﬁguration fo-
cused in this manuscript. By adding an additional 3∆
tone in each of the grounding SQUIDs, we can straight-
forwardly get a stretched Kagom´e lattice by opening the
B ⇔ C hopping branches (Fig. 1(a)). This general-
ization is natural in the sense that the Kagom´e lattice
and the honeycomb lattice (i.e. the stretched bricklayer
in Fig. 1(a)) are the line-graphs of each other (i.e. the
roles of bonds and sites are exchanged) [18]. This facility
may pave an alternative way of investigating anomalous
quantum Hall eﬀect and topologically nontrivial FB in
the future [33].

III. THE FLATNESS OF THE SYNTHESIZED

MIDDLE BAND

Ω± = ±2T(cid:113)

The novelty of the Lieb lattice lies in the existence of
a FB conﬁguration. To be concrete let us focus on a
speciﬁc situation of Eq. (2) that T r(cid:48),β
r,α = T is uniform
and A(x) = 0, in which the band structure of the lattice
becomes

cos2 kx + cos2 ky, Ω0 = 0,

(4)
with kx, ky ∈ [0, 2π] being the pseudo-momentums. As
shown in Fig. 1(c), Eq.
(4) provides a non-dispersive
middle band with zero eigenvalue and a Dirac cone struc-
ture around the three-band touching point (kx, ky) =
(π, π). The existence of the FB implies the emergence

3

(5)

of exotic FB localization on the perfect periodic lat-
tice, which is distinct from localization induced by disor-
der and should be interpreted by the mechanism of de-
structive interference [18]: A single-particle state |Φ(cid:105) =

∀ r, α,

Pr(cid:48)β = 0,

(cid:104)(r,α),(r(cid:48),β)(cid:105)

is met. The ring mode (RM) state |Φ1(cid:105) shown in Fig. 2(a)
is a representative example satisfying Eq. (5): If the pho-
ton wants to run away from this plaquette, it has to pass
ﬁrst through the four A sites on the corner. However,
Eq. (5) guarantees the coherent cancelation of the pho-
ton ﬂows towards the A sites, leaving |Φ1(cid:105) localized. The
similar situation is also valid for another RM state |Φ2(cid:105)
shown in Fig. 2(b), which contains two plaquette and can
be regarded as the superposition of two single-plaquette
RM states in Fig. 2(a). A direct generalization of this
observation ﬁgures out that the number of independent
states fulﬁlling Eq. (5) equals the number of indepen-
dent plaquette on the lattice, and it is this set of states
spanning the middle FB in Fig. 1(c).

r,α =(cid:82) r(cid:48),β

Moreover, we can go beyond the non-magnetic situa-
tion A(x) = 0 to consider the synthetic FB in the pres-
ence of artiﬁcial gauge ﬁeld, as the synthesized magnetic
ﬁeld for the charge-neutral photons can be introduced
by simply exploiting the freedom of controllable hop-
ping phase. Without loss of generality we choose Lan-
dau gauge that the vertical hopping phases are zero and
r,α A· dr for
the horizontal hopping phases are θr(cid:48),β
r = [m, n] with A = −θnex. The presence of the artiﬁcial
magnetic ﬁeld B = 2θez results in the fractral Hofstadter
butterﬂy spectrum [34] with the middle band remained
ﬂat during the variation of θ, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The
preservation of the ﬂatness can be illustrated by a spe-
ciﬁc example θ = π/3 where the unit-cell of the lattice is
enlarged by three times and the typical RM state takes
the form shown in Fig. 2(c). Just as the same as the
previous non-magnetic situations in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b),
each plaquette still corresponds to an independent RM
state, and the number of independent states satisfying
Eq. (5) is unchanged in the presence of B.

However, in realistic experiments there exists unavoid-
ably imperfection factors breaking the ideal ﬂatness of
the middle band, including the residual d.c. mixing be-
tween TLRs, the fabrication error of the circuit, and the
background low-frequency noises. Understanding their
eﬀects is thus crucial for our scheme.
In what follows
we discuss these imperfections with results showing that
the induced eﬀects are all much lower than the hop-
ping strength T , and some of them can be further sup-
pressed through the slight reﬁnement of the developed
PFC method.

The background d.c. mixing.—The background d.c.
mixing between the physically neighboring TLRs can be
characterized by the d.c. coupling strength T dc
αβ /2π ∈
[45, 60] MHz (see Appendix. A) and can result in Stark

NNN coupling lead to a ﬁnite width ∼ T dc
/∆ of the
central band. Meanwhile, these negative eﬀects can be
suppressed by the following methods: The Stark shifts
can be cancelled by simply modifying the modulating fre-
quencies of the grounding SQUIDs accordingly. For the
NNN coupling, notice that the dispersive coupling mech-
anism relies on the frequency match of the NNN TLRs,
i.e. the NNN hopping can eﬀectively happen only if the
NNN TLRs have the same eigenfrequencies [35]. There-
fore we exploit the interlaced unit-cell strategy where the
eigenfrequencies of the modes in unit-cell (m, n) are un-
changed if m+n is even and shifted up by ∆/3 if m+n is
odd. With this conﬁguration the NNN coupling between
neighboring unit-cells are eﬀectively suppressed and only
the two “diagonal” NNN hopping channels need to be
taken into consideration:

dle FB in Fig. 3(b) with the bandwidth similar to the
non-magnetic case.

The fabrication error.—The fabrication errors induce
the deviations of the realized circuit parameters from the
ideal settings (e.g. the lengths and the unit capacitances
or inductances of the TLRs) and lead to the disorder
δωr,α of the eigenmodes’ frequencies. Meanwhile, with
developed microelectronic techniques such fabrication-
induced disorder can be pushed to the level of 10−4 [27],
which corresponds to δωr,α ∼ 10−1T . Moreover, one can
similarly cancel the fabrication-induced frequency shift
by adjusting the frequencies of the two-tone PFC pulses
in the grounding SQUIDs. With such reﬁnement the
fabrication-induced diagonal disorder can be eﬀectively
suppressed while the performance of the dynamic modu-
lation method is not aﬀected.

Low frequency 1/f noise.—The low-frequency 1/f
noise is ubiquitous in SQCs and its inﬂuence exceeds that
of the thermodynamic noise [36]. The 1/f noise in the
proposed circuit can generally be traced back to the ﬂuc-
tuations of three degrees of freedom, namely the charge,
the ﬂux, and the critical current. Firstly, the proposed
circuit is insensitive to the charge noise as it consists of
only linear TLRs and grounding SQUIDs with very small
anharmonicity. Such insensitivity roots in the same ori-
gin of the charge insensitivity of transmon qubits [37].
Secondly, the ﬂux 1/f noises penetrated in the loops of
the grounding SQUIDs shift the d.c. bias of the ground-
ing SQUIDs in a quasi-static way. The consequent eﬀect
is then the ﬂuctuations

δωr,α < 10−3T , δT r(cid:48),β

r,α < 10−4T ,

(8)

where the detailed evaluation is included in Appendix. B.
Both the diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal ﬂuctuations are much
smaller than the propose homogenous hopping strength
T . Therefore such ﬂuctuations can inﬂuence negligibly
on the ﬂatness of the middle band. The eﬀects of the
critical current noise is similarly analyzed in Appendix.
B, with results indicating that the induced disorders are
even smaller than those of the ﬂux 1/f noises by several
orders [32, 38]. We thus come to the conclusion that our
scheme is robust against the 1/f noise in SQC, leaving
the residual NNN coupling the main and the only imper-
fection factor that should be taken care of.

IV. PROBING THE FB LOCALIZATION

The photonic nature of circuit QED allows the mul-
tiple occupation of a particular mode and the driving-
dissipation competition. These non-equilibrium and
bosonic features can be exploited to demonstrate the FB
localization on the proposed lattice, which serves as the
undoubtful evidence and the quantiﬁcation of the syn-
thetic middle FB. Here we emphasize that the essential
physics behind is the exotic middle FB of the Lieb lat-
tice which leads to the novel steady states of the circuit.

Explicitly, we study the coherent pumping described by
P†ae−iΩPt +h.c. in the rotating frame of HS where P and
a are the vectors composed of the pumping strengths and
the annihilation operators on the lattice, respectively,
and ΩP is the monochromatic detuning. The steady state
of the lattice is determined by

where κ is the assumed uniform decay rate of the TLRs
and the matrix B is deﬁned by a†Ba = HL. We then
consider the pumping and the consequent steady states
of a lattice consisting of 12 × 12 unit-cells with the open
boundary condition imposed and the NNN coupling in
Eq. (6) taken into consideration. We study the following
four pumping situations P†
2 a = TPR1,
P†
3 a = TPR2, and P†
4 a = TPR3 as shown in Figs. 2(b)—
(d), with r = [x0, y0] = [6, 6], TP/2π = 1 MHz, and
κ/2π = 100 kHz [22, 23, 25, 30]. The ﬁrst three situa-
tions correspond to single-site or RM pumpings in the
non-magnetic case, while the fourth corresponds to the
RM pumping in the presence of B = ez2π/3. The corre-
sponding SSPN distributions are depicted in Figs. 2(d)—
2(g), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the steady state
of the single-site pumping is extended around the unit-
cells neighboring to the pumping site. Meanwhile, when
the three RM pumpings are applied, the steady states
become signiﬁcantly localized, indicated by Figs. 2(e)—
(g). Also, by observing Figs. 2(e)—(g) we ﬁnd that the
residual extension of the SSPN distribution is along the
y = x direction. This is in consistence with the sublattice
strategy which cannot suppress the diagonal NNN cou-
pling in Eq. (6), leading to the photon leakage mainly
along this direction. The FB localization of the steady
states can be further quantiﬁed by the localization fac-
tor deﬁned as the ratio of the SSPN populated in the
pumping sites versus the SSPN populated in the pump-
ing sites and their nearest-neighboring unit-cells. Such
localization factor versus the d.c. mixing T dc
BC (and thus
the ﬂatness of the synthesized FB) is calculated and plot-
ted in Fig. 2(h), where the diﬀerence between the RM
pumpings and the single-site pumping can be clearly dis-
criminated, indicating the survival of the proposed FB
localization even in the presence of the unwanted NNN
hopping channels.

The measurement of the proposed FB localization
should also be considered. As the system is linear (i.e. it
does not involve photon-photon interaction), the steady
state can be described in the picture of multi-mode co-
herent state, and the SSPN on a particular site (r, α)
can be measured by a very simple method shown in Fig.
1: We capacitively connect this site to an external coil
with an (optional for pumping) input and an output
port. The steady state can be prepared by injecting mi-
crowave pulses through the input port for a suﬃciently
long time. During the steady-state period, energy will
leak out from the coupling capacitance, which is pro-
portional to the energy ωα(cid:104)α†
rαr(cid:105) with the proportional

constant determined by the coupling capacitance. The
target observable (cid:104)α†
rαr(cid:105) can then be measured by inte-
grating the energy ﬂowing to the output port in a given
steady-state time duration. The proposed FB localiza-
tion can therefore be extracted by monitoring only few
sites of the lattice (i.e. the pumping sites and their neigh-
bors). Actually, this scheme has already been used in a
recent experiment, where both the amplitude and the rel-
ative phase of a TLR coherent state were measured [25].
The key point is that what we want to measure here is
merely the expectation value (cid:104)α†
rαr(cid:105) but not the detailed
probability distribution in the TLRs Fock basis. It is this
weak requirement that greatly simplify the measurement
setup.

V. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

In conclusion, we have shown that it is not only pos-
sible but also advantageous to implement and detect the
FB physics of Lieb lattice in the proposed circuit QED
lattice. While the localized steady states of the RM exci-
tations considered in this manuscript can be thoroughly
understood in the single particle picture, what is more
important is that the dispersionless ﬂat band is an idea
platform of achieving correlated many-body states [1, 2].
The introduction of interaction will lead us to the realm
where rich but less explored physics locates. On the
other hand, as the strong coupling between the TLRs
and multi-level superconducting qubits has already been
achieved [14, 15], the Bose-Hubbard type [39, 40] and
Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard type photon-photon interac-
tion [16, 17] can be incorporated by coupling the TLRs
with superconducting qubits. Therefore, our further di-
rection should be the implementation and characteriza-
tion of nonequilibrium photonic fractional Chern insula-
tors in the proposed architecture [41].

Appendix A: Eigenmodes of the lattice and their

coupling

In this Appendix, we analyze in detail the eigenmodes
of the lattice and the coupling between them induced by
the grounding SQUIDs. These two issues can be illus-
trated through the analysis of the highlighted unit-cell
shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(c). During this investigation,

we also estimate the parameters of the proposed circuit
based on recently reported experimental data [22–25, 30]
and propose their representative values in Tab.
I. As
we focus solely on the highlighted unit-cell, the inﬂuence
from the other part of the lattice are minimized by set-
ting inﬁnitesimal inductances for the grounding SQUIDs
at the three individual ends.

1. Eigenmodes of the unit-cell

We assume the common grounding SQUID of the
three TLRs has eﬀective Josephson energy EJ =
EJ0 cos(πΦext/Φ0) with EJ0 its maximal Josephson en-
ergy, Φext the external ﬂux bias, and Φ0 = h/2e the ﬂux

quantum, as highlighted in Fig. 1(a).
let us assume that only a d.c. ﬂux bias Φdc
ex is added.
Physically speaking, a particular TLR (e.g. the TLR A)
can hardly “feel” the other two because the currents from
them will ﬂow mostly to the ground through the SQUID
due to its very small inductance [19, 20]. The SQUID can
then be regarded as a low-voltage shortcut of the three
TLRs, and it is this boundary condition that allows the
deﬁnition of individual TLR modes in the coupled cir-
cuit. More explicitly, the Lagrangian of the unit-cell can
be written as

are chosen from recent experiments of dynamic Casimir

demonstrates that the eigenmodes are well-separated in
the corresponding TLRs, indicating the one-to-one corre-
spondence between the TLRs and the eigenmodes. Such
separation can be quantiﬁed by the energy storing ratio

With the parameters in Tab. I we have

(φ1, φ2, φ3)/φ0

(A17)

Such small ﬂuctuation of φJ indicates that the derived
eigenmodes can be regarded as the individual λ/2 modes
of the TLRs slightly mixed by the grounding SQUID with
small but ﬁnite inductance (see also Fig. 4). We then es-
timate to what extent the grounding SQUID mixes the
individual λ/2 modes of the TLRs. We recall that such
mixing can be physically traced back to the d.c. Joseph-

that the grounding SQUID only slightly mixes the origi-

i.e. six orders of magnitude smaller than the second-order
terms reserved in Eqs. (A2) and (A18). Such small term
can be safely neglected and the validity of the Taylor
expansion in deriving Eq. (A2) is therefore veriﬁed in a
self-consistent way.

3. Parametric coupling between the eigenmodes

(A24)

where the 2∆ tone is exploited to induce the vertical
A ⇔ C hopping, and the ∆ tone is used for the horizontal
A ⇔ B hopping [20]. By representing φJ as the form
shown in Eq. (A16) we obtain the a.c. coupling from the
second term of Eq.

In the rotating frame of HS, the induced parametric pho-
ton hopping between the TLRs can be further written as

HL = eitHSHa.c.e−itHS

(cid:39)(cid:2)TBAeiθBA B†A + TCAeiθCA C†A(cid:3) + h.c.,

(A26)
where Tαβ are the eﬀective hopping strengths propor-
(A24), and
tional to the corresponding Φαβ in Eq.
the fast-oscillating terms in eitHSHACe−itHS are omit-
ted due to rotating wave approximation. The ampli-
tudes of the two tones can be selected as [ΦBA, ΦCA] =
Φ0 [0.9%, 1.3%] such that the homogeneous coupling
strength T /2π = TBA/2π = TCA/2π = 10 MHz can be
induced [22–25]. In addition, Eqs. (A24) and (A26) im-
ply that arbitrary nontrivial hopping phases can be ob-
tained by merely choosing the appropriate initial phases
of the modulating pulses, indicating the site-resolved syn-
thesization of the artiﬁcial gauge ﬁeld for the microwave
photons. For instance, we can construct the nontrivial
horizontal A ⇔ B hopping phases while leave the verti-
cal hopping phases trivial. Such conﬁguration leads to
Landau gauge

A = [Ax, 0, 0] ,
B = Bez = [0, 0,−∂Ax/∂y] ,
which will be exploited in the main text.

(A27)

We should also be careful that the modulating fre-
√
quency of Φac
ex(t) must be lower than the plasma fre-
quency of the grounding SQUID ωp =
8ECEJ [37],
otherwise the internal degrees of freedom of the SQUID
will be activated and complex quasi-particle excitations
will emerge [19]. This requirement is fulﬁlled by the
very small inductance of the grounding SQUID. With
the parameters selected we have the estimation ωp/2π ≈
136 GHz = 68∆/2π, leading to the eﬀective suppression
of the grounding SQUID excitation.

Appendix B: Low frequency noise of the lattice

,

(A23)

In this Appendix, we calculate in detail the ﬂuctuation
induced by the ﬂux and critical current 1/f noises. It is

generally believed that a particular noise δO(t) of the
physical variable O in solid-state physics exhibiting the
1/f spectrum can be modelled by the Dutta-Horn model,
i.e. the summation of random telegraph noises emitted
from an ensemble of bistable ﬂuctuators [36]. The 1/f
type ﬂuctuation of δO can be described by its noise spec-
trum

Therefore the strength of δΦ can be estimated as
δΦ/Φ0 ∈ [10−5, 10−4]. Such ﬂuctuation is by two orders
of magnitude smaller than the d.c. Φdc
ex = 0.37Φ0 and the
[ΦBA, ΦCA] = [0.9%, 1.3%] Φ0. The existence of δΦ
a.c.
shifts Φdc
ex in a quasi-static way, and its inﬂuence can be
evaluated through the Taylor expansion of Eqs. (A18)
and (A25) with respect to Φdc

Based on the parameters in Tab. I, we can evaluate that
the ﬂuctuating δΦ causes negligible

δωr,α/2π ∈ [10−3, 10−2] MHz < 10−3T /2π,
δT r(cid:48),β
r,α /2π ∈ [10−4, 10−3] MHz < 10−4T /2π.

(B6)

(B7)

In addition, experiments have shown that the critical
current noise has AIJ0 ≈ 10−6IJ0 for a junction at tem-
perature 4 K [38, 45]. The parameter AIJ0/IJ0 proves
to be proportional to the temperature down to at lease
100 mK. Therefore we set AIJ0/IJ0 ∈ [10−7, 10−6]. The
inﬂuence of the critical current noise can also be esti-
mated by the Taylor expansion of Edc and Ha.c. with an
alternative respect to EJ0 = IJ0/2e. Following the esti-
mation similar to that of the previous ﬂux noise, we can
evaluate that the ﬂuctuating δIJ0 causes

δωr,α/2π ∈ [10−4, 10−3] MHz < 10−4T /2π,
δT r(cid:48),β
r,α /2π ∈ [10−5, 10−4] MHz < 10−5T /2π,

(B8)

(B9)

which can be safely neglected because they are even
smaller than the ﬂux-noise-induced eﬀects.

ωmin/2π = 1 Hz, ωmax/2π = 1 GHz,

(B2)
based on the scale of the experiment time and the ∼ 50
mK temperature scale of the dilute refrigerator [36, 42].
In addition, we can treat δO(t) as quasi-static in the
following estimation due to its low frequency property,
i.e. it does not vary during a experimental run, but varies
between diﬀerent runs. The variance of δO(t) can be
evaluated from SO(ω) as

indicating that the range of the ﬂuctuating δO can be
roughly estimated as δO ∈ [−5, 5]AO.

In the following we estimate the inﬂuence of the 1/f
noises on the proposed scheme. For the ﬂux type 1/f
noise, various previous measurements has shown that

AΦ/Φ0 ∈ (cid:2)10−6, 10−5(cid:3) does not vary greatly with the

loop size, inductor value, or temperature [38, 43, 44].
