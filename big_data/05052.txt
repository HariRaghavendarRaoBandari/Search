Abstract

In this paper, we reconsider the slice hyperholomorphic Bargmann-Fock space introduced recently by
Alpay, Colombo, Sabadini and Salomon as well as the full hyperholomorphic Bargmann-Fock space.
Our main purpose is to introduce a quaternionic analogue of the classical Segal-Bargmann transform
and discuss some of its basic properties.

Keywords: Slice regular functions; Bargmann-Fock space; Segal-Bargmann transform.

1. Introduction

In 2014, Alpay, Colombo, Sabadini and Salomon have introduced a quaternionic analogue of the
classical Bargmann-Fock space in the setting of the new theory of slice regular functions (see [2]). More
precisely, they considered

slice(H) = SR(H) ∩ L2(CI; e−ν|z|2dλ),
F 2,ν

where SR(H) is the space of slice (left) regular functions on H and CI is a given slice associated to given
I ∈ S = {q ∈ H; q2 = −1}. They proved that F 2,ν
slice(H) is independent of the choice of the imaginary
unit I ∈ S and is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.

In the present paper, we will reconsider F 2,ν

slice(H) and review some of its properties, although some

new results are also obtained. We show in particular that the functional space

f ull(H) = SR(H) ∩ L2(H; e−ν|q|2dλ)
F 2,ν

is dense in F 2,ν
slice(H). Moreover, we introduce and study a quaternionic analogue of the classical Segal-
Bargmann transform that maps isometrically the classical Hilbert space on the real line to the slice hy-
perholomorphic Bargmann-Fock space.

To present these ideas, we are going to adopt the following structure: In Section 2, we collect some
useful backgrounds from the theory of slice regular functions. In Section 3, we reconsider the space
F 2,ν
slice(H) and introduce the full one F 2,ν
f ull(H) in the slice hyperholomorphic setting. The last section is
devoted to the introduction and the study of a quaternionic analogue of the Segal-Bargmann transform.

2. Preliminaries on slice regular functions

The theory of quaternionic slice regular functions has been introduced quite recently by Gentilli and
Struppa in [8] (see also [9]). Since then, it was extensively studied and analogies of some known classical
theorems in complex analysis theory have been developed. It has found many interesting applications
in operator theory [4]. This new theory contains polynomials and power series with quaternionic co-
efﬁcients, contrary to the Fueter theory of regular functions deﬁned by means of the Cauchy-Riemann-
Fueter differential operator. For an illustration of the meeting points for these two functions theories see
for example [13]. To make the paper self-contained, we review in this section some basic mathematical
concepts relevant to slice regular functions. For more details, we refer the readers to [8, 9, 4, 10].
Let H denotes the quaternions algebra with its standard basis {1, i, j, k} satisfying the Hamiltonian
multiplication i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = −1, ij = −ji = k, jk = −kj = i and ki = −ik = j. For q ∈ H, we
write q = x0 + x1i + x2j + x3k with x0, x1, x2, x3 ∈ R. The quaternionic conjugate and the modulos of

1

(cid:113)

(cid:113)

q are deﬁned to be q = x0 − x1i − x2j − x3k = Re(q) − Im(q) and |q| = (cid:112)qq =

2 + x2
3,
respectively. We have in particular |Im(q)| =
3. Notice for instance that the unit sphere
S2 = {q ∈ ImH;|Im(q)| = 1} in ImH can be identiﬁed to S = {q ∈ H; q2 = −1}, the set of imaginary
units. Moreover, any q ∈ H \ R can be rewritten in a unique way as q = x + Iy for some x, y ∈ R and
I ∈ S.
For every given I ∈ S, we deﬁne the slice LI, denoted also CI, to be LI = CI = R + RI. It is
isomorphic to the complex plane C so that it can be considered as a complex plane in H passing through
0, 1 and I. Their union is the space of quaternions, H = ∪
(R + RI) and their intersection is

(R + RI).

The basic notion in this section is the following

: Ω −→ H, with respect to x(cid:96), (cid:96) = 0, 1, 2, 3, on a given open
Deﬁnition 2.1. A real differential function f
domain Ω ⊂ H, is said to be a slice (left) regular function if, for all I ∈ S, the restriction fI to the complex line
LI = R + IR is holomorphic on ΩI := Ω ∩ LI, that is it has continuous partial derivatives with respect to x and
y and the function ∂I f : ΩI −→ H deﬁned by

∂I f (x + Iy) :=

1

vanishes identically on ΩI.

Since no confusion can arise, we will refer to slice left-regular functions as slice regular functions
or simply regular functions any short and denote their space by SR(Ω). It turns out that SR(Ω) is a
right vector space over the non commutative ﬁeld H. According to the previous deﬁnition, the basic
polynomials with quaternionic coefﬁcients on the right are slice regular functions. Notice also that the
power series ∑n qnan; an ∈ H, deﬁnes a slice regular function in its domain of convergence, which is
proved to be an open ball B(0, R) := {q ∈ H; |q| < R}. Here the space of slice regular functions is
endowed with the natural uniform convergence on compact sets.

Characterization of slice regular functions on a ball B = B(0, R) centered at the origin is given in [9].

Namely, we have
Lemma 2.2 (Series expansion). A given H-valued function f is slice regular on B(0, R) ⊂ H if and only if it
has a series expansion of the form:

f (q) =

+∞
∑
m=0

qm 1
m!

∂m f
∂xm (0),

converging on B(0, R) = {q ∈ H;| q |< R}.
Deﬁnition 2.3. A domain Ω of H is said to be a slice domain (or just s-domain) if Ω ∩ R is nonempty and
for all I ∈ S, the set ΩI
:= R + RI. If moreover, for every
q = x + yI ∈ Ω, the whole sphere x + yS := {x + yJ/J ∈ S} is contained in Ω, we say that Ω is an axially
symmetric slice domain.

:= Ω ∩ LI is a domain of the complex plane LI

For example the whole space H and the Euclidean ball B = B(0, R) of radius R centered at the origin

are axially symmetric slice domains. The following results are of particular interest (see [4, 10]).
Lemma 2.4 (Splitting lemma). Let f : B −→ H be a slice regular function. For every I and J two perpendicular
imaginary units, there exist two holomorphic functions F, G : BI −→ LI such that for all z = x + yI ∈ BI, we
have

fI(z) = F(z) + G(z)J,

where BI = B ∩ LI and LI = R + RI.
Lemma 2.5 (Representation formula). Let Ω be an axially symmetric slice domain and f ∈ SR(Ω). Then,
for any I, J ∈ S, we have the following formula

(cid:2) fJ(x + yJ) + fJ(x − yJ)(cid:3) +

(cid:2) fJ(x − yJ) − fJ(x + yJ)(cid:3)

for all q = x + yI ∈ Ω.
Lemma 2.6 (Extension Lemma). Let ΩI be a domain in CI symmetric with respect to the real axis. If fI
ΩI −→ H is holomorphic, then setting

:

f (x + yJ) =

[ fI(x + yI) + fI(x − yI)] +

extends fI to a regular function on the symmetric completion
Moreover, f is the unique slice regular extension of fI.

This is used by the authors of [2] to prove that the deﬁnition of the slice hyperholomorphic Bargmann-
Fock space F 2,ν
(H) is in fact independent of the choice of the imaginary unit I ∈ S. Below, we present
I
a new direct proof of this fact. More precisely, we have the following

Since |1 ± I J| ≤ 1 + |JI| ≤ 2, we obtain

(cid:12)(cid:12) fJ(x + yJ)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ | fI(x + yI)| + | fI(x − yI)| ,

Theorem 3.3. The slice hyperholomorphic Bargmann-Fock space F 2,ν

Proof. What needed to prove this theorem is completeness. For this, let ( fn)n be a Cauchy sequence in
F 2,ν
slice(H). Let J ∈ S be perpendicular to I, then by the splitting lemma (Lemma 2.4) we can write
= fn,1 + fn,2J where ( fn,1)n, ( fn,2)n are two sequences belonging to the classical Bargmann Fock space

F 2,ν(CI) that is complete. Thence, since ( fn)n is a Cauchy sequence in the slice hyperoholomorphic
Bargmann Fock space so do ( fn,1)n, ( fn,2)n in F 2,ν(CI). Thus, it will exist two holomorphic functions
∈ F 2,ν(CI) to which ( fn,1)n and ( fn,2)n are converging in the norm of F 2,ν(CI) respectively.

Hence, by the extension lemma (Lemma 2.6), the holomorphic functions f1 I , f2 I on CI could be extended,
in a unique way, to a slice regular function on the whole H, by considering

4. On the full quaternionic Bargmann-Fock space

We consider the Hilbert space L2(H, e−ν|q|2dλ(q)), of all square integrable functions with respect to

the gaussian measure on H, as well as the subspace

f ull(H) := SR(H) ∩ L2(H, e−ν|q|2dλ(q)).

of F 2,ν
Fock space F 2,ν
slice CI deﬁned by

F 2,ν(CI) := Hol(CI) ∩ L2,ν(CI)

contains both the slice quaternionic Bargmann-Fock space F 2,ν

fI belongs to F 2,ν(CI). Moreover,

f ull(H) we have that hI belongs to F 2,ν(CI) and similarly for any f ∈ F 2,ν

slice(H) and the full one F 2,ν

f ull(H). Thus, for
slice(H) the restriction

slice(H) = (cid:104) fI, hI(cid:105)F 2,ν(CI ) .
(cid:104) f , h(cid:105)F 2,ν
Therefore (cid:104) f , h(cid:105)F 2,ν(CI ) = 0 for any h ∈ F 2,ν
f ull(H) if and only if (cid:104) fI, g(cid:105) = 0 for all g ∈ F 2,ν(CI), for every
I ∈ S, thanks to the extension lemma (Lemma 2.6). Now, since the orthogonal of F 2,ν(CI) with respect
to (cid:104),(cid:105)F 2,ν(CI ) is reduced to {0}, we obtain that fI ≡ 0 on CI, for arbitrary I ∈ S. This implies in particular
that f ≡ 0 on ∪
I∈S

CI = H. This proves(cid:0)F 2,ν(H)(cid:1)⊥

= {0}.

5. A quaternionic analogue of the Segal-Bargmann transform

In this section we propose a quaternionic analogue of the Segal-Bargmann transform. We show
that it realizes, as in the complex setting, an isometric isomorphism from the Hilbert space L2(R; dx),
consisting of all the square integrable H-valued functions, onto the quaternionic Bargmann-Fock space
F 2,ν
slice(H). To this end, we consider the kernel function

Proof. By writing the quaternion q as q = u + vIq ∈ CIq, with u, v ∈ R and Iq ∈ S, we get q2 =
u2 − v2 + 2uvIq. Thus, by replacing q and q2 by their expressions in terms of u, v and Iq, we can write

As immediate consequence of the last result, combined with the linearity of Bν and the orthogonality

of the hν

Theorem 5.6. The quaternionic Segal-Bargmann transform Bν realizes a surjective isometry from the Hilbert
space L2(R; dx) onto the quaternionic Bargmann-Fock space F 2,ν

slice(H).

Proof. The isometry of Bν can be handled by establishing the equality

(cid:107)Bνψ(cid:107)F 2,ν

slice(H) = (cid:107)φN − φM(cid:107)L2(R;dx) −→
slice(H) such that (BνφN)N converges to f in the norm of F 2,ν

(cid:107)BνφN − BνφM(cid:107)F 2,ν
Hence, there exists f in F 2,ν
slice(H). Subse-
quently, there exists a subsequence (BνφNk )k of (BνφN)N converging to f , almost everywhere. However,
thanks to Proposition 5.3, we have the following estimation
|BνφN(q) − Bνψ(q)| = |Bν(φN − ψ)(q)| ≤

2|q|2 (cid:107)φN − ψ(cid:107)L2(R,dx) .

Thus, we deduce that (BνφN)N converges pointwise to Bνψ and therefore Bνψ = f := lim
ingly, we get

The injectivity is obvious from the isometry property. The proof of Bν is surjective lies essentially on the
