ELLIPTIC OPERATORS WITH UNBOUNDED DIFFUSION

Abstract. In this paper we give suﬃcient conditions on α ≥ 0 and c ∈ R
ensuring that the space of test functions C∞

and L0 with suitable domain generates a quasi-contractive and positivity pre-
serving C0-semigroup in Lp(RN ), 1 < p < ∞. The proofs are based on some
Lp-weighted Hardy’s inequality and perturbation techniques.

1. Introduction

Let us consider the elliptic operator

L = (1 + |x|α)∆,

where α ≥ 0. In this paper we want to study the perturbation of L with a singular
potential. More precisely, we consider the operator

L0 = L +

c
|x|2

and we look for optimal conditions on c ∈ R and α ensuring that L0 with a suitable
domain generates a positivity preserving C0-semigroup in Lp(RN ).

Let us recall ﬁrst some known results for Schr¨odinger operators with inverse-

square potentials.
It is known, see [19, Theorem 2], that the realization A2 of the Schr¨odinger operator
c (RN \ {0}) if and only if
A = ∆ + c|x|−2 in L2(RN ) is essentially selfadjoint on C∞

c ≤

(N − 2)2

4

− 1 =: c0,

cf. [4, Proposition VII.4.1] or [18, Theorem X.11], when N ≥ 5.
The characterization of the existence of positive weak solutions to the parabolic
problem associated with the operator A was ﬁrst discovered by Baras and Goldstein
[2], where they proved that a positive weak solution exists if and only if c ≤ (N −2)2
.
Using perturbation techniques it is proved in [15, Theorem 6.8] that A2 is self-
adjoint provided that c < c0. These techniques were generalized to the Lp-setting,
1 < p < ∞, and it is obtained that Ap, the realization of A in Lp(RN ) with do-
main W 2,p(RN ) generates a contractive and positive C0-semigroup in Lp(RN ), and
C∞

c (RN ) is a core for Ap, if N > 2p and

see [16, Theorem 3.11]. In the case where N ≤ 2p, it is proved that Ap with domain
D(Ap) = W 2,p(RN ) ∩ {u ∈ Lp(RN ); |x|−2u ∈ Lp(RN )} is m-sectorial if c < β0, see
[16, Theorem 3.6].

If one replaces the Laplacian by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator similar results

were obtained recently in [3], [7].

In this paper we obtain similar results as in [16, Theorem 3.11] when replacing
∆ by L. We discuss also the generation of a C0-semigroup of the operator (1 +
|x|α)∆ − η|x|β + c

|x|2 , where η is a positive constant, α ≥ 2 and β > α − 2.

Now, let us recall some deﬁnitions. An operator (A, D(A)) on a Banach space
X is called accretive if −A is dissipative. It is m–accretive if A is accretive and
X = R(λ + A), the range of the operator (λ + A). An accretive operator (A, D(A))
is called essentially m–accretive if its closure A is m–accretive.

Our approach relies on the following perturbation result due to N. Okazawa, see

[16, Theorem 1.7].

Theorem 1.1. Let A and B be linear m–accretive operators in a Banach space X
with uniformly convex X ∗. Let D be a core of A. Assume that

(i) there are constants ˜c, a ≥ 0 and k1 > 0 such that for all u ∈ D and ε > 0

RehAu, kBεuk2−p

|Bεu|p−2Bεui ≥ k1kBεuk2

where Bε denote the Yosida approximation of B;

(ii) Rehu, kBεuk2−p
(iii) there is k2 > 0 such that A − k2B is accretive.

|Bεu|p−2Bεui ≥ 0, for all u ∈ X and ε > 0;

p

Set k = min{k1, k2}. If c > −k then A + cB with domain D(A + cB) = D(A) is
m–accretive and any core of A is also a core for A + cB. Furthermore, A − kB is
essentially m–accretive on D(A).

In order to apply the above theorem, we need some preliminary results on the

operator L and some Hardy’s inequalities.

2. Preliminary results

Let us begin with the generation results for suitable realizations Lp of the oper-
ator L in Lp(RN ), 1 < p < ∞. Such results have been proved in [6, 9, 11]. More
speciﬁcally, the case α ≤ 2 has been investigated in [6] for 1 < α ≤ 2 and in [9] for
α ≤ 1, where the authors proved the following result.

Theorem 2.1. If α ∈ [0, 2] and α ≤ (N − 2)(p − 1) then, for any p ∈ (1, +∞), the
realization Lp of L with domain

Dp = {u ∈ W 2,p(RN ) : |x|α|D2u|, |x|α/2|∇u| ∈ Lp(RN )}

generates a positive and strongly continuous quasi-contractive analytic semigroup.
Moreover C∞

c (RN ) is a core for Lp.

The case α > 2 is more involved and is studied in [11], where the following facts

are established.

Theorem 2.2. Assume that α > 2.

1. If N = 1, 2, no realization of L in Lp(RN ) generates a strongly continuous

(resp. analytic) semigroup.

2. The same happens if N ≥ 3 and p ≤ N/(N − 2).
3. If N ≥ 3, p > N/(N − 2) and 2 < α ≤ (p − 1)(N − 2), then the maximal

realization Lp of the operator L in Lp(RN ) with the maximal domain

Dmax = {u ∈ W 2,p(RN ) : (1 + |x|α)∆u ∈ Lp(RN )}

UNBOUNDED DIFFUSION AND INVERSE SQUARE POTENTIALS

generates a positive C0-semigroup of contractions, which is also analytic if
α < (p − 1)(N − 2).

4. If N ≥ 3, p > N/(N − 2) and 2 < α < N (p−1)

p

the domain Dmax coincides

with the space cDp = {u ∈ W 2,p(RN ) : |x|α−2u, |x|α−1|∇u|, |x|α|D2u| ∈

Lp(RN )}. Moreover, C∞

If we consider the operator ˜L := L − η|x|β with η > 0 and β > α − 2 then we
can drop the above conditions on p, α and N , as the following result shows, see [1].
Theorem 2.3. If α > 2 and β > α − 2 then, for any p ∈ (1, ∞), the realization ˜Lp
of ˜L with domain

fDp = {u ∈ W 2,p(RN ) : |x|βu, |x|α−1|∇u|, |x|α|D2u| ∈ Lp(RN )}

generates a positive and strongly continuous quasi-contractive analytic semigroup.
Moreover, C∞

c (RN ) is a core for ˜Lp.

From now on we assume N ≥ 3, α ≥ 0. We set

γα =(cid:18) N + α − 2

p

(cid:19)2

(2.1)

and recall the following Hardy’s inequality. For a proof we refer to [16, Lemma 2.2
& Lemma 2.3] for the case α = 0 and [11, Appendix] for α ≥ 2. Here we give a
simple proof based on the method of vector ﬁelds introduced by Mitidieri in [13],
which holds for any α ≥ 0.

Lemma 2.4. For every u ∈ W 1,p(RN ) with compact support, one has

γαZRN

|u|p

|x|2 |x|αdx ≤ZRN

|∇u|2 |u|p−2|x|αdx.

(2.2)

Moreover, the constant γα is optimal.

Proof. By density, it suﬃces to prove (2.2) for u ∈ C1
let us consider the vector ﬁeld F (x) = λ x
Integrating by parts and applying H¨older and Young’s inequalities we get

c (RN ). So, for every λ ≥ 0,
|x|2 |x|α, x 6= 0, and set dµ(x) = |x|αdx.

|u|pdivF dx = λ(N − 2 + α)ZRN

Hence,

(cid:20)λ(N − 2 + α) −

|u|p

|x|2 |x|α dx ≤ZRN

|∇u|2 |u|p−2|x|α dx.

By taking the maximum over λ of the function ψ(λ) = λ(N − 2 + α) − λ2p2/4, we
get (2.2).
We note here that the integration by parts is straightforward when p ≥ 2. For
1 < p < 2, |u|p−2 becomes singular near the zeros of u. Also in this case the
integration by parts is allowed, see [10].
The proof of the optimality of the constant γα can be found in [11, Appendix].

Concerning the last assertion, it suﬃces to note that if u ∈ W 1,p(RN ), then
(cid:3)

u+ ∈ W 1,p(RN ) and ∇u+ = χ{u≥0}∇u (see [8, Lemma 7.6]).

As a consequence of Lemma 2.4 we have the following results.
Proposition 2.5. Assume α ≤ (N − 2)(p − 1). Let V ∈ Lp
V (x) ≤

So, using the identities |∇|u||2 ≤ |∇u|2 and |u|∇|u| = Re(u∇u), we obtain

|∇|u||2|u|p−2(1 + |x|α)dx

|u|p−1∇|u| · x|x|α−2dx

if p ≥ 2. The case 1 < p < 2 can be handled similarly. Thus, by H¨older’s inequality
we have

Remark 2.6. The assumption α ≤ (N − 2)(p − 1) is optimal for the dissipativity
of L, as proved in [11, Proposition 8.2].

Hence, in order to apply Theorem 1.1, we have established

Applying Corollary 2.7, Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 1.1 we obtain the following
generation results. We distinguish the two cases α ≤ 2 and α > 2 since the
hypotheses on the unperturbed operator L are diﬀerent.

Proof of Theorem 3.5. In order to apply Theorem 1.1, set A = −L, D(A) = cDp,

D = C∞
|x|2 endowed with the
maximal domain D(|x|−2) = {u ∈ Lp(RN ); |x|−2u ∈ Lp(RN )} in Lp(RN ). We
observe that the Yosida approximation Bε of B is the multiplicative operator by
Vε = 1
|x|2+ε . Both A and B are m–accretive in Lp(RN ). Then, Lemma 3.1 yields
(i) in Theorem 1.1 with k1 = β0, ˜c = 0 and a = 0. The second assumption (ii) in
Theorem 1.1 is obviously satisﬁed. The last one, (iii), holds with k2 = (p − 1)γ0
thanks to Corollary 2.7. Then, we infer that for every c < k, −L − c
|x|2 with domain
|x|2 by Theorem 2.2.
Moreover, −L − k
|x|2 is essentially m–accretive. By the Lumer Phillips Theorem
[5, Chap.II, Theorem 3.15]) we obtain the generation result. Finally, the
(cf.
positivity of the semigroup is a consequence of Proposition 2.8. The dispersivity is
equivalent to the positivity of the resolvent, which is equivalent to the positivity of
the semigroup.

c (RN ) is a core for −L − c

If 2p ≥ N , then β0 ≤ 0 and we cannot apply Theorem 1.1. However, if at least
βα ≥ 0, then we still have a generation result, relying on the following abstract
theorem by Okazawa (see [16, Theorem 1.6]).

Theorem 3.6. Let A and B be linear m–accretive operators in a Banach space X
with uniformly convex X ∗. Let D be a core of A. Assume that there are constants
˜c, a, b ≥ 0 such that for all u ∈ D and ε > 0,

where Bε := B(I + εB)−1 denotes the Yosida approximation of B. If ν > b then
A + νB with domain D(A) ∩ D(B) is m–accretive and D(A) ∩ D(B) is core for A.
Moreover, A + bB is essentially m–accretive on D(A) ∩ D(B).

In our framework the above result leads to the following theorems. We recall that
D(|x|−2) = {u ∈ Lp(RN ); |x|−2u ∈ Lp(RN )}.

Theorem 3.7. Assume 0 ≤ α ≤ 2. If 2p ≥ N and 2p−N ≤ α ≤ (N −2)(p−1) then,
