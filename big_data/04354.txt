Abstract

In the present work we report a comprehensive analysis of shell model results for high-spin states

of 87Sr and 87Zr for recently available experimental data within the full f5/2pg9/2 model space using

JUN45 and jj44b eﬀective interactions developed for this model space. In this we have compared

the energy levels, electromagnetic transition probabilities, quadrupole and magnetic moments with

available experimental data. We have conﬁrmed structure of high-spin states of these two nuclei

which were tentatively assigned in the recent experimental work. In the case of 87Sr, for positive

parity states up to ∼ 7.5 MeV, both interactions predict very good agreement with experimental

data, while negative parity states are slightly suppressed in jj44b calculation. For the 87Zr nucleus,

the jj44b interaction predicts higher energies for the negative parity states beyond J ≥ 27/2−. The

conﬁguration, which have one hole in νg9/2 orbital, is responsible for generating the states in 87Sr.

In the case of 87Zr, low-lying positive parity states come with the conﬁguration having three holes

in the νg9/2, while the odd-parity states have conﬁguration ν(f −1

5/2g−2

9/2).

INTRODUCTION

Experimental information on low-lying single-particle excited states are available for many

nuclei. Because of the advancement in experimental techniques now it possible to populate

high spin states of nuclei beyond Ni. These experimental results are stringent test for the

predicting power of shell model for high spin excited states. It is possible to test two-body

matrix elements for predicting the high-spin states which are generated by aligning the an-

gular momenta due to broken nucleon pairs. The nuclei in this region show many interesting

features, such as spherical shell, isomeric states, candidates of double and neutinoless double

beta decay [1–12].

High spin states of 88Zr have recently been populated up to ∼ 20¯h and an excitation

energy of 10 MeV in 80Se(13C,5n)88Zr fusion evaporation reaction [13]. Similarly, the high

spin states of 89Zr were populated using the fusion evaporation reaction 80Se(13C,4n)89Zr.

The observed high-spin states up to 10 MeV excitation energy and spin ∼ 37/2¯h are reported

in Ref. [14]. The dominance of single-particle excitations is shown for both positive and

negative parity states. The high-spin band structure of 85Sr, was populated in the reaction

76Ge(13C,4n)85Sr [15]. The spin and parity of diﬀerent levels up to the spin of ∼ 35/2¯h

and excitation energy ∼ 7.5 MeV were established. Here shell model explains the various

features, such as the odd-even staggering, very well. In the case of 86Sr the high-spin states

were populated using 76Ge(13C,3n)86Sr reaction. The level scheme up to 10.9 MeV excitation

energy and maximum spin of ∼ 19¯h have been reported in Ref. [16].

In the present work our focus will be on 87Sr and 87Zr. Experimentally, the high-spin

structure of 87Sr previously studied in refs. [17, 18]. Recently, using the fusion-evaporation

reaction 82Se(9Be,4n)87Sr, the states populated up to an excitation energy of 7.4 MeV at

spin 31/2¯h reported in Ref. [19]. The structure of high spin states using in-beam γ-ray

spectroscopic method 87Zr was studied through the 59Co(32S,3pn)87Zr reaction [20], level

scheme was established up to spin (37/2+) and (43/2−).

Motivated by the success of our shell model results in this region for recently measured

high spin states of 88Zr[13], 89Zr [14], 85Sr [15] and 86Sr [16], in the present work we will

focus on the shell model study of recently populated high-spin states of 87Sr and 87Zr.

II. SHELL MODEL CALCULATION

In the present shell model calculations 56Ni is taken as the inert core with the spherical

orbits 1p3/2, 0f5/2, 1p1/2 and 0g9/2. We have performed calculation with the jj44b and

JUN45 eﬀective interactions. The jj44b interaction was ﬁtted with 600 binding energies

and excitation energies from nuclei with Z = 28 − 30 and N = 48 − 50 available in this

region. Here, 30 linear combinations of JT coupled two-body matrix elements (TBME) are

varied giving the rms deviation of about 250 keV from the experiment. The single particle

energies (spe) are taken to be -9.656, -9.287, -8.269 and -5.894 MeV for the p3/2, f5/2,

p1/2 and g9/2 orbitals, respectively [21]. For the JUN45, the single-particle energies for the

1p3/2, 0f5/2, 1p1/2 and 0g9/2 orbitals are -9.828, -8.709, -7.839, and -6.262 MeV respectively.

The JUN45 [3] interaction is based on Bonn-C potential, the single-particle energies and

two-body matrix elements were modiﬁed empirically with A = 63∼69 mass region. We

have performed calculations using the shell model code Antoine [22]. The maximum matrix

dimension in M-scheme > 30 millions for 87Zr.

A. Shell model results for 87Sr

Experimental data are available from the earlier works [17, 18] and recent work [19],

where the states are populated up to the excitation energy of 7.4 MeV with 31/2¯h spin.

Useful structural information can be extracted through the study of this nucleus since both

number of protons and neutrons are near closed shells and in this region spherical and

collective behaviors of nuclei are important. In Fig. 1 the comparison of our shell model

calculation with the experimental data are shown, where we have used two diﬀerent JUN45

and jj44b interactions.

The ground state 9/2+

1 , which comes from the ν(g−1

by both calculations. In the JUN45 calculation the values of 5/2+

9/2) conﬁguration, is predicted correctly
1 energy levels

1 and 7/2+

are only 65 keV lower and 3 keV higher than in the experiment, respectively. In the jj44b

calculation they are 86 keV lower and 351 keV higher than in the experiment, respectively.

The 1/2+

The 3/2+

The 13/2+

1 , 5/2+

2 and 9/2+

2 levels are closer to the experiment in the jj44b calculation.

1 , 3/2+
2 level is far from experiment almost at the same amount in the both calculations.
1 level, which is because of the π(f −1

9/2) conﬁguration, is predicted

1/2) ⊗ ν(g−1

5/2p1

163 keV and 178 keV lower than in the experiment in the JUN45 and jj44b calculations,

respectively.

As is seen from Fig. 1 all the 17/2+
1

- 31/2+
1

levels are predicted lower than in the

experiment in the JUN45 calculation.

In the jj44b calculation these levels are little bit

lower than even in the JUN45 calculation up to 27/2+

1 , but 29/2+

1 and 31/2+

1 levels are well

predicted by this calculation. According to the both shell model calculations these states

come from π((p3/2f5/2p1/2)−2(g2

9/2) conﬁguration. Probabilities vary within 35% -
60% and 24% - 49% in the calculations with the JUN45 and jj44b interactions, respectively.

9/2)) ⊗ ν(g−1

The JUN45 calculation predicts 17/2+

2 and 25/2+

2 levels in the experiment only with 71 keV

and with 279 keV diﬀerences, respectively. In the jj44b calculation they are comparatively

low.

The negative parity 1/2−, 3/2−, 5/2−, 9/2−

1 and 11/2−

1 levels, which are due to the

neutrons in pf shell, better predicted by the JUN45 calculation. The 7/2− level which

appears in both calculations is not measured yet in the experiment, although experimentally

the doublet of levels (5/2−,7/2−) supposed to be at 2656 keV. The negative parity 13/2−

1 -

23/2−

1 states are due to π((p3/2f5/2p1/2)−1(g1

9/2) conﬁguration, with 35% - 64% and
33% - 53% probabilities, in the calculations with JUN45 and jj44b interactions, respectively.

9/2))⊗ν(g−1

As is seen from Fig. 1 though distance between 13/2− and 15/2− larger and those of between

the pair of levels 17/2− and 19/2−, and 21/2− and 23/2− are more compressed, in general

the negative parity states are described reasonably well by JUN45 calculation.

In jj44b

calculation all negative parity levels, except 19/2−

2 , are lower than in the JUN45 calculation.

B. Shell model results for 87Zr

The structure of high spin states of 87Zr was studied using in-beam γ-ray spectroscopic

method through the 59Co(32S,3pn)87Zr [20]. Positive parity level scheme was established up

to spin (37/2+) and the negative parity level scheme up to (43/2−).

As in the case of 87Sr ground state spin of the 87Zr is also 9/2+ since still neutrons in

the g9/2 orbital play role for the ground state. Now we see that less energy is needed in
order to excite nuclei to 13/2+

1 state. This is reasonable since now neutrons are little bit
further from the ﬁlling g9/2 orbital as compared to the 87Sr nucleus. In the calculation with
JUN45 interaction the 9/2+

1 levels, and the 7/2+

2 level appears after the 11/2+

1 level. In Fig. 2 we have not

shown the levels for which spins are not assigned in the experiment. But in the experiment

there exist spin not assigned levels with energies 523.7 and 589.7 keV [23] which are close to

the calculated 5/2+

1 level. The 7/2+

1 is close to the experiment in jj44b, but the 7/2+

2 level

is much higher in both calculations. In the JUN45 calculation 11/2+

1 and 11/2+

2 levels are

between 13/2+

1 and 17/2+

1 levels as in the experiment, but in jj44b calculation 11/2+

2 level is

located after 17/2+

1 level. The 1/2+

1 , 3/2+

1 , 9/2+

2 , and 19/2+

1 levels can be spin not assigned

levels observed in the experiment [23]. The levels 21/2+

1 only 22 and 79 keV
higher than in the experiment in the jj44b calculation. Between these levels there are 19/2+
1

1 and 25/2+

and 23/2+

1 levels which also appear in the JUN45 calculation and are not measured in the

experiment. In the JUN45 calculation between the levels 25/2+

1 and 29/2+

1 , which are lower

than in the experiment in both calculations, there are 25/2+

1 levels in the JUN45
calculation. They are not measured in the experiment. In the jj44b calculation only 27/2+
1
1 and 29/2+
are the same with the experimental one in both JUN45 and jj44b calculations. Though the

level appears between the levels 25/2+

1 . The sequence of levels 29/2+

1 and 29/2+

2 and 27/2+

2

distance between the levels are quite similar to the experiment, in the JUN45 calculation

they are little bit lower than in the experiment. In the jj44b calculation the ﬁrst of these

levels is only 79 keV higher and the second one is 208 keV lower than in the experiment and

the distance between the levels is little bit compressed as compared to the experiment and

the JUN45 calculation.

For I ≥ 29/2+

9/2] conﬁguration dominates.
Agreement of the calculated 31/2+ level with the experimental one is approximately the same

1 states the π[(p3/2f5/2)−1(g9/2)3] ⊗ ν[(f −1

5/2g−2

in both calculations. However the 33/2+ level is in better agreement with the experimental

one in the jj44b calculation and is lower in the JUN45 calculation. The 35/2+ level is located

higher than in the experiment in both calculations. In the JUN45 calculation its value is

closer to the experimental one than in the jj44b calculation. The 37/2+ level is predicted

lower than in the experiment in the JUN45 calculation and is predicted higher in the jj44b

calculation.

The arrangement of lowest negative parity levels of 87Zr are very similar to those of 87Sr.

As in the case of 87Sr we have not shown the levels for which spins are not assigned in the

experiment. Therefore 3/2−, 5/2−, 7/2− and 9/2− levels which appear in the calculations

may be one of this spin not assigned levels. Obviously these levels are due to the neutrons

4, respectively. As is seen from Fig. 3, for the positive parity states in 87Sr the occupancy

of the proton orbitals are sensitive to the nuclear spin, including states up to high spins.

Here the πg9/2 occupancy is increasing at the expense of πf5/2 and πp1/2 occupancy. For the

negative parity states the dependence of the occupancy of the proton orbitals from the spins

still remains, however now the neutron occupancy at lower spins showing irregular pattern.

For negative parity states the occupancy of πg9/2 is increasing at the expense of the πp1/2

orbital occupancy only.

From Fig. 4 one can see that the proton occupancy becomes more stable up to high spins

in the positive parity states of the 87Zr nucleus as compared to the 87Sr nucleus. The visible

changes in the occupancy with respect to spins can be seen in g9/2 orbital, the increase in

the occupancy is at the expense of the πp1/2 orbital occupancy only, as in the case of 87Sr.

In Table I, we have reported experimental versus calculated B(E2) and B(M1) values in

W.u. with diﬀerent transitions. All the B(E2) values of 87Sr are in better agreement with

the experiment in both calculations and B(E2) values of 87Zr are predicted much larger than

in the experiment in both calculations. We have used the recommended ep=1.5e, en=1.1e

values of eﬀective charges [3] in the JUN45 interaction. Larger neutron eﬀective charge is

more resonable in this mass region which adopted by Honma et al. [3] from the least-squares

ﬁt to the 49 known experimental values of qudrupole moments. With the (ep, en)=(1.5,1.1)

the agrrement between theory and experiment is very good. In the present work, large B(E2)

values are due to many nucleons in the valence shells and the agreement may be improved

by slightly reducing the eﬀective charges. Quality of the magnetic moment agreement with

the experimental data is also like quadrupole moments: the magnetic moments of 87Sr are

better described by the calculations.

The electric quadrupole and magnetic moments we have listed in Tables II and III,

respectively. For the 87Sr nucleus the Q(9/2+

1 ) value is +0.349 according to the calculation

with JUN45 interaction, which is closest to the experimental +0.305(2) value. The jj44b

predicts the value larger than experimental one. In the case of 87Zr, the Q(9/2+

1 ) value is

lower for JUN45, while jj44b it is very large. Though in general quadrupole moments are

in excellent agreement with the experimental data, the agreement still can be improved by

reducing eﬀective charges which is reasonable for these nuclei. The shape of 87Sr is more

spherical than 87Zr in the 7/2+

1 state according to the quadrupole moment values calculated

by both interaction for this state.

For the calculation of magnetic moments, the recommended in [3] values geﬀ

are

used. The results of JUN45 interaction, is in very good agreement with experimental data.

In the case of jj44b calculation the predicted value is slightly lower. Here geﬀ

s may

improve the results.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Motivated by recent experimental results for high-spin states in 87Sr and 87Zr, we per-

formed shell model calculations for these nuclei in f5/2pg9/2 model space using JUN45 and

jj44b eﬀective interactions. The results for energy levels and electromagnetic transitions are

presented. The high spin energy levels are described very well by the eﬀective interactions

for the full f5/2pg9/2 model space.

In general both eﬀective interactions show very good

agreement with the experimental data, For 87Zr, the jj44b interaction predicts negative par-

ity states beyond J ≥ 27/2− higher in energy. The calculated values of quadrupole moment

are in good agreement with available experimental data.
