ABSTRACT
We obtain analytical approximations for the expectation and variance of the Spec-
tral Kurtosis estimator in the case of Gaussian and coherent transient time domain
signals mixed with a quasi-stationary Gaussian background, which are suitable for
practical estimations of their signal-to-noise ratio and duty-cycle relative to the in-
strumental integration time. We validate these analytical approximations by means of
numerical simulations and demonstrate that such estimates are aﬀected by statistical
uncertainties that, for a suitable choice of the integration time, may not exceed a few
percent. Based on these analytical results, we suggest a multiscale Spectral Kurtosis
spectrometer design optimized for real-time detection of transient signals, automatic
discrimination based on their statistical signature, and measurement of their proper-
ties.

INTRODUCTION

The Spectral Kurtosis Estimator (dSK ) was originally pro-

posed by Nita et al. 2007 as a statistical tool for real-time
radio frequency interference (RFI) detection and excision in
a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) radio spectrograph. The

ﬁrst–ever hardware implementation of an dSK spectrograph,

the Korean Solar Radio Burst Locator (KSRBL, Dou et al.
2009), provided comprehensive experimental data that val-
idated its theoretically expected performance (Gary et al.
2010).

The dSK estimator is a higher order unbiased statistical

estimator associated with an accumulated Power Spectral
Density (PSD), which is deﬁned as (Nita & Gary 2010a,b),

dSK =

are sums taken over M raw FFT consecutive PSD estimates
and, respectively, their squares.

A remarkable property of the dSK estimator is that, in

the case of a pure Gaussian time domain signal, its statis-
tical expectation is unity at each frequency bin, while the
power spectrum may have an arbitrary spectral shape. This

property gives the dSK estimator the ability to discriminate

signals deviating from a Gaussian time domain statistics
against arbitrarily shaped astronomical backgrounds, as it

is usually the case of the man-made signals producing un-
wanted RFI contamination of the astronomical signals of in-
terest. Nevertheless, as demonstrated by Nita et al. (2007),

astronomical transient signals such as radio spikes, which
might be mistakenly ﬂagged by a blind RFI excision al-

the dSK estimator may be equally sensitive to narrow band
gorithm assuming that all dSK values deviating from unity

should be excised from the astronomical signal of interest.
However, as demonstrated here, rather than being a limita-
tion of its practical applicability, this particular sensitivity

of the dSK estimator to transient signals may be exploited

not only to detect them, but also to quantitatively charac-
terize their properties. For this purpose, we analyze the sta-
tistical properties of these two special classes of transients,
and obtain analytical expressions for the expected mean and

variance of their associated dSK estimators as functions of

their eﬀective durations and signal-to-noise ratios.

2 STATISTICS OF GAUSSIAN TRANSIENTS

In this section we analyze the statistical properties of dSK es-

timator in the case of narrow band Gaussian transient time
domain signal mixed with a quasi-stationary Gaussian back-
ground. In §2.1 we provide an overview of the results pre-
viously reported by Nita & Gary (2010a) regarding the ex-
pected mean and variance of the dSK estimator associated
with a quasi-stationary time domain Gaussian signal. In §2.2
we generalize these results and provide an analytical expres-
sion for the expectation of the dSK estimator in the case of
a transient Gaussian signal mixed with a Gaussian time do-
main background, which, in the M ≫ 1 limit reduces to the
M ≫ 1 limit of an analytical expression previously reported

2 G. M. Nita

by Nita et al. (2007). In addition, we obtain an analytical

expression for the variance of the dSK estimator under the

same conditions. We validate these theoretical expectations
by means of numerical simulations.

2.1 Quasi-stationary Gaussian signals

As shown by Nita & Gary (2010a), in the case of a quasi-
stationary time domain signal obeying a Gaussian statistics,
the statistical expectations for the FFT-derived nth-powers
of the sums S1 and S2 deﬁned by Eqn. 2 are given by

where µ represents the mean power of the quasi-stationary
Gaussian background at the particular frequency bin con-
sidered.

In particular, Eqn. 3 provides the expectations

lasting shorter than the accumulation time, we adopt the
model originally considered by Nita et al. (2007), in which
the mean spectral power of the transient signal is character-
ized by a signal-to-noise ratio ρ relative to the mean power
of the quasi-stationary background, µ, and the transient sig-
nal is considered to be eﬀectively present only in an integer
fraction δM of the M raw PSD estimates contributing to
the accumulations S1 and S2. Hence, taking in considera-
tion that S1 and S2 are sums of a series of uncorrelated
random variables, a simple binomial expansions leads to

which are linear combinations of the expectations given by
Equations 4 and 5.

Although the identities given by Eqn. 8 do no longer
exactly hold in the case of Gaussian transients, we assume
that the expressions given by Eqns. 6 and 7 can still serve

as biased estimators of the ﬁrst and second moments of dSK.
Consequently, after a few algebraical manipulations of Eqn.
6, the biased [SK ∗ estimator corresponding to the adopted
Gaussian transient model can be written as
2(1 − δ)δρ2M 2

[SK ∗ = 1 +

(1 + δρ)2M 2 + (1 − δ)δρ2M − (1 + 2δρ + δρ2)

which, for accumulation lengths M ≫ 1, reduces to

[SK ∗ ≃ 1 +

2(1 − δ)δρ2
(1 + δρ)2 .

, (12)

(13)

As a ﬁrst self-consistency check of the adopted [SK ∗ approx-
imation, we note that, for any ρ, Eqns. 12 and 13 reduce to
unity when δ = 0 or δ = 1, i.e. the cases of no transient
signal or, respectively, the mixture of two quasi-stationary
Gaussian signals. Therefore, [SK ∗ produces unbiased esti-
mates at both ends of the duty-cycle range. For all other
cases, [SK ∗ deviates from unity and reaches a maximum at
δ = 1/(2 + ρ), i.e.

[SK ∗(cid:16) 1

2 + ρ(cid:17) = 1 +

ρ2

2(1 + ρ)

.

(14)

Similarly, from Eqn. 7, we obtain an approximation for the

variance of dSK that, for M ≫ 1, reduces to

−18δ3ρ4 + 10δ2ρ5 − 4δ3ρ5 + δ3ρ6).

For δ = 0 and δ = 1, Eqn. 15 reduce to the expressions given
by Eqn. 9, while in between these extremes, and ﬁxed SNR,

[SK∗ has a single-peaked duty-cycle dependence.

Fig. 1 displays, for a ﬁxed SNR (ρ ≡ 5), the duty-cycle

crepancy we calculate the percentages of the dSK values lying
outside the [SK ∗ ± σ2
[SK∗ range, p = 15.3% for M = 97 and
p = 22.2% for M = 9766, which show that, from a prac-
tical perspective, the analytical expression given by Eqn.
15 provides a non-standard ﬂuctuation interval that has a
larger conﬁdence level of not being crossed by a random
sample than a standard ±1σ interval that, in the case of
a normal distribution, would be expected to leave 31.73%
of the sample points scattered outside its bounds. We note,

Having available only the biased approximations of the

p = 31.5% for M = 9766, do also correspond to higher
than standard conﬁdence levels. This behavior is consistent

however, that the percentages of dSK values lying outside

proved to be a non-negligible eﬀect when 1 ± 3σdSK RFI
detection thresholds were experimentally tested in the ﬁrst
implementation of an dSK spectrometer (Gary et al. 2010).
ﬁrst two moments of the true dSK distribution associated
with a Gaussian transient, [SK ∗ and σ2
[SK∗ , we can obtain
neither a Pearson Type IV PDF analytical approximation,
nor an alternative three–moment based Pearson Type III
approximation that could be accurate enough for practi-
cal applications (Nita & Gary 2010b). Nevertheless, for the
practical purpose of estimating a particular pair {δ, ρ} by
means of dSK measurements, one can instead use post facto
ticular [SK ∗ ± σ [SK∗ realization. However, to facilitate the
rors formalism for translating the dSK statistical ﬂuctua-
tions estimated by means of Monte-Carlo simulations into
formal standard deviations {σδ, σρ}, we propose the use
of an empirical standard-deviation (SDEV) correction fac-
tor, γ, which would produce an equivalent SDEV range

Monte-Carlo simulations such those illustrated here to es-
timate the true conﬁdence level corresponding to the par-

use of the mathematically convenient propagation of er-

[SK ∗ ± γσ [SK∗ that would leave outside its bounds 31.73%
of the simulated dSK random variables. Fig. 1 indicates such

SDEV corrections (dot–dashed lines) that, for γ = 0.7013
and γ = 0.8093, result in leaving outside their correspond-
ing ranges p = 31.7% and p = 32.1% of the scattered ran-
dom variables, for M = 97 and M = 9766, respectively.

scope Subsystem Testbed (FST, Liu et al. 2007) and the Ex-
panded Owens Valley Solar Array Subsystem Testbed (EST,
Gary et al. 2012). We compare these theoretical expecta-

distributions (scattered points) that were obtained by gen-

ranging from 0% to 100% . This comparison demonstrates
an overall good agreement of the δ–dependent mean of the

tion length M increases.

We note that, as M increases, not only the bias of the
[SK ∗ approximation becomes practically negligible, but also
the diﬀerences between the hdSKi(1 ± ǫ) , [SK ∗ ± σ [SK∗ , and
[SK ∗ ± γσ [SK∗ ranges, which indicate that, as the dSK distri-
bution approaches normality, the [SK ∗ and σ2
[SK∗ approxi-
mations become asymptotically unbiased. We thus conclude
that Eqns. 13 and 15 provide approximations suitable for
accurate estimations of the characteristics of Gaussian tran-
sients.

To illustrate the expected performance of the dSK esti-

mator in detecting Gaussian transients, we show in Fig. 1a,b
(horizontal lines) the Pearson Type IV asymmetric detec-
tion thresholds (Nita & Gary 2010a) corresponding to the

standard 0.13499% PFA on each side of the unity dSK ex-

pectation, i.e. 1+0.903
−0.058 for M = 9766,
and in Fig. 1c we display the corresponding percentages of
detected transients as function of their duty-cycles (thin line
and tick line, respectively). Fig.1c reveals that, for a given

−0.439 for M = 97, and 1+0.063

with the transient duty-cycle, as the direct result of the duty-

SNR, the dSK detection performance may signiﬁcantly vary
cycle dependence of the dSK estimator and its statistical ﬂuc-

tuations, as seen in panels (a) and (b). However, for large
accumulation lengths, as is the case of M = 9766, the de-
tection performance is a ﬂat 100%, except for narrow ranges
close to the both ends of the [0 − 100]% duty-cycle interval.
The overall transient detection performance of the
dSK estimator is expected to increase as the signal-to-noise
ratio increases, as indicated by Fig. 2, which displays the
duty-cycle variation of the [SK ∗ estimator (thick lines),
and its expected [SK ∗ ± σ2
[SK∗ ﬂuctuations (thin lines), for
M = 97 (panel a), M = 9766 (panel b), and three selected
signal-to-noise ratios, ρ = 5, 7, 10, (solid, dashed, and dot–
dashed lines, respectively). However, as shown by 2a, the
[SK ∗±σ2
[SK∗ ranges corresponding to diﬀerent signal-to-noise
ratios may overlap, which could result in large uncertainties
of the SNR and duty-cycle estimates obtained from dSK mea-

surements. Although, as suggested by 2b, such uncertainties
are expected to decrease as the accumulation length M in-
creases, a more quantitative investigation is called for, which
is presented in the next section.

2.3 dSK measurements of Gaussian transients
To demonstrate the ability of an dSK spectrometer to mea-

sure Gaussian transients, we consider the favorable case
of a Gaussian transient fully contained within the bounds
of a single accumulation characterized by the accumulated
power S1(ti) and proceeded by a transient–free accumula-
tion S1(ti−1). Based on such two consecutive power mea-
surements, one may deﬁne the apparent signal-to-noise ratio

η =

S1(ti)
S1(ti−1) − 1,

(16)

which simply relates to the true SNR and duty-cycle of the
transient as η = δρ. Hence, from Equation 13, immediately

Therefore, in the case of an observed Gaussian transient,
Equations 1, 15–19 and 22 provide the theoretical means for
estimating its signal-to-noise ratio and duty-cycle, as well as
the corresponding statistical uncertainties, in terms of the

S1 and S2 measurements provided by the dSK spectrometer.

To investigate the accuracy of the estimations provided
by this method, we display in Figure 3 the results obtained
in the case of the Monte-Carlo simulations used to generate

the dSK distributions shown in Figure 1.

Panels 3a and 3b display (plus symbols), for M = 97
and M = 9760, respectively, the relative errors of the duty-
cycle estimates versus the true duty cycles of the simulated
transients. The pairs of solid curves shown in both panels in-
dicate the expected ±σδ/δtrue range, as inferred from Equa-
tion 19, which appear to be in good qualitative agreement
with the trend of the observed ﬂuctuations of the duty-cycle
estimates. To help quantify this comparison, the square sym-
bols indicate, for each simulated duty-cycle, the percentages
of duty-cycle estimates laying within these ranges, i.e. the
conﬁdence levels of the δ ± σδ intervals. This comparison
show that, for all duty cycles, these conﬁdence levels remain
close to the 68.27% standard deviation conﬁdence level we
intended to achieve by applying the SDEV correction fac-
tors to the σ2
[SK∗ variances estimated by Equation 15, i.e.
γ = 0.7013 for M = 97, and γ = 0.8093 for M = 9766.
However, the duty-cycle trend they follow, indicate a sys-
tematic overestimation of the true standard–equivalent σδ
ﬂuctuations for δ <≃ 50%, and a systematic underesti-
mation for larger duty cycles. Similarly, panels 3c and 3d
display the relative errors of the SNR estimates, their ex-
pected ±σρ/ρtrue intervals, as inferred from Equation 19,
and the conﬁdence levels of these intervals, which appear to
have a duty-cycle dependence that is systematically higher
than a standard 68.27% conﬁdence level. Therefore, for any
duty-cycle, Equation 19 systematically overestimate the true
standard–equivalent ﬂuctuations of the ρ estimates.

Figure 3 demonstrates that the statistical ﬂuctuations
of both δ and ρ estimates, which appear to be symmetrically
distributed around the true parameter values, signiﬁcantly
decrease as the duty-cycle increases from zero to about 50%,
and continue to decrease at a more slower pace, as the duty-
cycle approaches 100%. Remarkably, these ﬂuctuations de-
crease by one order of magnitude as the accumulation length
increases from M = 97 to M = 9766.

However, we note that all of the above conclusions are
based on the estimates obtained from all simulated Gaussian
transients, disregarding whether or not they were actually
ﬂagged as such by the 0.13499% PFA detection thresholds
shown in Figure 1. The make such distinction, we use black

symbols to display the estimates obtained from dSK ﬂagged

measurements, and grey symbols for those obtained from
those transients that would remain undetected in a real–
life experiment. The ratio of black symbols to n = 1000,
which is the total number of simulated transients having the
same duty-cycle, follows, in each case, the duty-cycle depen-

that, although any individual dSK measurement may be af-

fected by practically small statistical uncertainties, the sam-
ple means of the δ and ρ estimates corresponding to a group
of Gaussian transients characterized by the same true SNR
and duty-cycle, may be statistically biased. Nevertheless, as

sian transient simulations used to generate the dSK distributions
shown in Figure 1. The estimates obtained from transients ﬂagged
by the 0.13499% PFA dSK detection thresholds are indicated by
black plus symbols, and the estimates obtained from not ﬂagged
dSK simulations are shown as grey symbols. The pairs of solid
curves in each panel indicate the range of the expected standard–
equivalent ±1σ statistical ﬂuctuations, as derived from Equation
sigma-delta-rho in which the known true values δtrue and ρtrue
have been entered, and the correction factors γ = 0.7013 and
γ = 0.8093, for M = 97 and M = 9766, respectively, have been
applied to the corresponding dSK(δtrue, ρtrue) expected ﬂuctua-
tions, as provided by Equation 15. The square symbols shown in
each panel indicate the true conﬁdence levels of the ±1σ inter-
vals, which are compared with a standard 68.27% conﬁdence level
(horizontal lines). Due to much smaller ﬂuctuations aﬀecting the

same plots the relative errors and conﬁdence levels in panels (c)

reduced by increasing the accumulation length, or, at the
cost of larger probabilities of false alarm, by lowering the
detection thresholds for short accumulation lengths.

We thus conclude that the results displayed in Figure 3

clearly demonstrate the ability of the dSK –based measure-

ment method presented in this section to provide estimates
of the true parameters that, for suﬃciently large accumula-
tion lengths, may be aﬀected by standard–equivalent statis-
tical ﬂuctuations not larger than a few percent.

3 STATISTICS OF COHERENT TRANSIENTS

In this section we analyze the statistical properties of the

dSK estimator in the case of a coherent transient time do-
main signal mixed with a quasi-stationary Gaussian back-
ground. In §3.1 we obtain a generally valid expression for
the dSK estimator that, in the limit M ≫ 1, reduces to the
M ≫ 1 approximation of an expression previously reported
by Nita et al. (2007), and we also obtain a ﬁrst order ap-
proximation for the variance of this estimator. In §3.2 we
generalize these results and provide analytical expressions
for the dSK estimator and its variance in the case of a tran-

sient coherent signal mixed with a Gaussian time domain
background. We validate these analytical expectations by
means of numerical simulations.

3.1 Quasi-stationary coherent signals

To determine the statistical properties of the dSK estimator
associated with coherent signals mixed with Gaussian back-
ground, we follow the same framework employed in §2.2 for
the case of Gaussian transients, with the only diﬀerence be-
ing that the underlaying probability distribution function of
the raw FFT–derived PSD estimate P is in this case given
by (McDonough & Whalen 1995)

pdf (P ) =

1

2σ2 exp(cid:16) −

P + A2

2σ2 (cid:17)I0(cid:16)√P A
σ2 (cid:17),

(23)

where σ2 represents the variance of a time domain Gaussian
background, A is the amplitude of a mixed time-domain
sinusoidal signal, and Iα is the modiﬁed Bessel function of
ﬁrst kind.

Taking in consideration that, at each frequency bin, the
mean spectral power of the time domain Gaussian back-
ground relates to the time domain variance σ2 as µ = 2σ2
(Nita et al. 2007), and deﬁning the signal-to-noise ratio of
the mixed coherent signal as ρ = A2/2σ2, Eqn. 23 may
be rewritten in terms of the normalized random variable
x ≡ P/σ2 = 2P/µ as a non-central chi-square distribution
with k = 2 degrees of freedom and non-centrality parameter
λ = 2ρ, i.e. χ2

pdf (x, 2, 2ρ), where

(24)

Using the linearity property of the expectation operator, and
assuming statistical independence of the time series samples,
the PDF given by Eqn. 24 provides

E[S1] = M (1 + ρ)µ; E[S2] = M (2 + 4ρ + ρ2)µ2.

(25)

To compute the expectation E(S2

1 ), which is needed to

evaluate the expectation of the dSK estimator, we de-

rive the probability distribution of a sum of M indepen-
dent χ2
pdf (x, 2, 2ρ)–distributed random variables, which is

pdf (x, 2M, 2ρM ), from which we get

with a Gaussian background.

We note that for ρ = 0, as expected, Eqn. 33 reduce
to the M ≫ 1 approximation (4/M ) of the variance of the
dSK estimator associated with a quasi-stationary time do-
main Gaussian signal, while it vanishes as fast as 8/M ρ2,
when ρ goes to inﬁnity.

3.2 Coherent transient signals

To investigate how the dSK estimator is expected to devi-

ate from unity in the case of coherent time domain sig-
nal
lasting shorter than the accumulation time, we em-
ploy the same framework as in §2.2, with the only diﬀer-
ence of replacing the underlaying gamma statistical distribu-
tion characteristic to a Gaussian PSD estimate (Nita et al.
2007; Nita & Gary 2010a,b), with the χ2
pdf (x, 2, ρ) distribu-
tion (Eqn. 24) describing the statistical properties of the
PSD estimates corresponding to a coherent time domain
signal characterized by a signal-to-noise ratio ρ relative to
a quasi-stationary Gaussian time domain background. This
approach straightforwardly leads to the biased expectation

[SK ∗ = 1 +

(1 + δρ)2M 2 − δ2ρ2M − (1 + 2δρ)
which, for accumulation lengths M ≫ 1, reduces to

(1 + δρ)2 .

(34)

(35)

As expected, for δ=0 (no transient signal present), both
Eqns. 34 and 35 reduce to unity, while for δ = 1 (quasi-

stationary coherent signal), they reduce to the full dSK ex-
pression and its (M ≫ 1) approximation provided by Eqn.
31. However, diﬀerently from the case of Gaussian tran-
sients, which are exclusively characterized by dSK values

limitation of the dSK or time domain kurtosis–based RFI

34 and 35 may take values larger than unity for δ < 0.5 and

interval for duty-cycles close to 50%, which is a well-known

theless, similar to the case of Gaussian transients addressed

detection algorithms (Ruf et al. 2006; De Roo et al. 2007;
Nita et al. 2007; Nita & Gary 2010a,b; Gary et al. 2010).
However, for δ = 1/(4 + ρ), Eqn. 35 reaches its maximum
deviation from unity, [SK ∗ = 1 + ρ2/(8 + 4ρ), which makes
dSK a very a very eﬃcient coherent transient detector. Never-
in §2.2, an evaluation of the dSK statistical ﬂuctuations is

as the experimental uncertainties aﬀecting any parameter

The absence of closed form analytical expressions for
the moments of the sums of squared random variables dis-
tributed according to χ2
pdf (x, 2, ρ) , which prevented us from
obtaining an exact analytical expression for the variance of

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2002)

the dSK estimator associated with a quasi-stationary coher-

ent signal, also prevents us from obtaining an analytical ex-
pression in the case of coherent transients. Moreover, the
approach we used to in §3.1 to obtain the ﬁrst order ap-
proximation of the dSK variance is not directly applicable in
the case of coherent transients due o the fact that S1 and S2
are not sums of random variables drawn from the same par-
ent population. Instead, we provide an approximation that,
although may seem based on more or less speculative ba-
sis, will be proven to be in agreement with the statistical
ﬂuctuations observed in numerical simulations.

Our approach is motivated by the observation that, al-
though the full expressions of the [SK ∗ estimators associated
with the Gaussian (Eqn. 12) and coherent (Eqn. 34) tran-
sients are mathematically diﬀerent, their (M ≫ 1) approxi-
mations (Eqns. 13 and 35, respectively) are mathematically
equivalent in the sense that the same observed dSK value
larger than unity may be either the result of a Gaussian
transient characterized by the parameter pair {δ, ρ}, with δ
anywhere in the 0− 100% range, or, alternatively, the result
of a coherent transient with a duty-cycle shorter than 50%
characterized by the parameters {δ/2, 2ρ}. While, in the ab-
sence of additional information, this morphological transfor-
mation makes in principle indistinguishable the true phys-
ical nature of the observed transients exclusively from one

dSK measurement, it oﬀers us enough grounds to speculate
that the true variance of the coherent transient dSK estima-
tor might be reasonably approximated by applying the same
morphological transformation to the (M ≫ 1) approxima-
tion provided by Eqn. 15. This leads to the approximation

which, for δ = 0, reduces to 4/M , which is indeed the (M ≫

which needs to be compared with the non-identical approx-
imation that we analytically derived directly from the true
statistical distribution of the PSD samples provided by Eqn.
33.

This comparison reveals that, while Eqn. 37 also re-
duces to 4/M for ρ = 0, unlike Eqn. 33, it does not com-
pletely vanishes as ρ goes to inﬁnity. Instead, it approaches
as fast as 1/2M − 2/M ρ a residual value of 1/2M that prac-
tically vanishes for large accumulation lengths M . Based on
this comparison, we ﬁnd the semi-analytical approximation
provided by Eqn. 36 suitable for practical application, es-
pecially in the light of analysis illustrated in Fig. 1, which
indicated the need of a numerical SDEV correction of the
σ [SK∗ analytical expression.

In Fig. 4 we present a similar analysis for the purpose of
validating the analytical expressions obtained in this section.
Remarkably, when compared with the sample mean of the
Monte-Carlo simulations (plus symbols), the inaccuracy of
the [SK ∗ approximation (solid red lines) appears to be neg-

theless, for both values of M , the [SK ∗±σ [SK∗ ranges (dashed

lines) appear to largely overestimate the sample standard
deviation (square symbols). In this simulation, we ﬁnd that
the same SDEV correction factor γ = 0.38 is needed to be
applied for both values of M to assure that 68.27% of the

simulated samples are scattered within the [SK ∗ ± γσ [SK∗

ranges indicated by the dot–dotted lines.

The same as in the case of Gaussian transients, the

dSK performance in detecting coherent transients, which is

illustrated Figure 4c, improves as the accumulation length
increases, reaching a ﬂat 100% for all duty-cycles except nar-
row ranges at both ends of the interval, as well as around the
50% duty-cycle mark. Fig. 2 completes this detection per-
formance analysis by showing that the coherent transient

detection performance of the dSK estimator increases as the

20% do not exceed a few percent. We also ﬁnd that the con-
ﬁdence levels of the δ ± σδ intervals, also provided Equation
38, are consistent with a standard 68.27 conﬁdence level for
most of the duty-cycle interval, while the conﬁdence levels of
the ρ ± σρ intervals are systematically higher. We thus con-
clude that dSK –based measurement method presented in

this section has a level of accuracy is suitable for practical
applications.

4 dSK DISCRIMINATION OF UNDERLAYING

TRANSIENT STATISTICS

In the previous sections we demonstrated the ability of an

dSK spectrometer to detect and measure two special cat-

egories of spectral transients mixed with a Gaussian time
domain background. However, this performance analysis in-
volved prior knowledge of the true, Gaussian or coherent,
statistical nature of the transients. Therefore, the ability of

inferring the underlaying transient statistics from dSK mea-

surements has still to be demonstrated. For this purpose, we
consider the hypothetical case of two transients, one Gaus-
sian and another coherent, that have the same signal-to-
noise ratios and durations, and investigate the variation of

their expected dSK estimator as function of various accumu-

lation lengths.

Figure 7 presents the result of such analysis for an ac-
cumulation length set to M = 97. To model some particular
aspects that may be encountered in a real experiment, both
transients were purposely chosen to have a SNR ρ = 5, a
duration ∆M = 3500 FFT blocks, longer than the accumu-
lation length, and an oﬀset δM = 50 FFT blocks relative
to the start of one of the accumulation blocks. Figures 7a
and 7b display the accumulated power and, respectively,
the duty-cycle, which both have ﬂat distributions over all
but the two accumulation blocks containing the rising and
falling edges of the transients. Consequently, as shown in

Figure 7c, the expected dSK of the Gaussian transient de-

viates from unity only in the accumulations bins that do
not have a duty-cycle equal to 0% or 100%. However, due
to their relatively large statistical ﬂuctuations, the rising
and falling edges of such Gaussian transients may or may
not be ﬂagged by the 0.13% PFA detection thresholds, i.e.
[0.56, 1.90]. On the contrary, in Figure 7d, all inner accu-
mulations blocks are ﬂagged as unambiguously containing a
coherent transient, because the exact 100% duty cycle trans-

lates into less than unity dSK values. However, the rising
edge of such a coherent transient would escape detection
due to its ∼ 50% duty-cycle, while its falling edge, which
corresponds to a duty-cycle ∼ 11%, may or may not escape
detection due to its relatively large statistical ﬂuctuation,
despite an dSK = 1.90 that happens to be close the maxi-

mum value attainable by a coherent transient having ρ = 5,
which is δ = 1/9 = 11.11% (Equation 35).

Therefore, the results illustrated by Figure 7 indicate
that, for accumulation lengths shorter than the transient du-

ration, the dSK analysis alone is guaranteed to detect 100%

duty-cycle transients, unambiguously recognize their coher-
ent dynamics, and even directly measure their duration with
an uncertainty comparable with the integration time. How-
ever, a Gaussian transient having the same 100% duty-cycle

may entirely escape dSK detection. Moreover, even if both

duty-cycle estimates (panels a and b, M = 97 and M = 9766,

M = 9766, respectively) obtained from the same set of coher-
ent transient simulations used to generate the dSK distributions
shown in Figure 4. The estimates obtained from transients ﬂagged
by the 0.13499% PFA dSK detection thresholds are indicated by
black plus symbols, and the estimates obtained from not ﬂagged
dSK simulations are shown as grey symbols. The pairs of solid
curves in each panel indicate the range of the expected standard–
equivalent ±1σ statistical ﬂuctuations computed based on the
known true values δtrue and ρtrue. The same correction factor
γ = 0.38 has been applied for both M = 97 and M = 9766 to
the corresponding dSK(δtrue, ρtrue) expected ﬂuctuations, as pro-
vided by Equation 36. The square symbols shown in each panel
indicate the true conﬁdence levels of the ±1σ intervals, which are
compared with a standard 68.27% conﬁdence level (horizontal
lines). Due to much smaller ﬂuctuations aﬀecting the M = 9766
estimates, diﬀerent scales are used to display on the same plots
the relative errors and conﬁdence levels in panels (c) and (d).

ambiguously attributed to the edges of a a Gaussian tran-

Based on this analysis presented in Figure 7, we con-

clude that an dSK spectrometer may eﬃciently ﬂag contin-

uous or transient coherent signals longer than its integra-
tion time, as well as both Gaussian and coherent transients
shorter than its integration time, but without being able to
unambiguously discriminate the statistical nature of such
short transients. Nevertheless, based on a combined S1 and

dSK analysis, the statistical nature of the transients lasting

longer than the integration time could be inferred, and thus,
their duration and signal-to-noise ratios estimated based on
the correct statistical model.

The ﬁrst experimental validation of such dSK spectrom-
lar radio burst, and a software–implemented dSK spectrom-

eter design involving sets of 100 µs contiguous acquisition
blocks followed by 20 ms acquisition gaps, Nita et al. (2007)

demonstrated the ability of the dSK spectrometer to selec-

tively ﬁlter out RFI transients shorter or longer than the
integration time, while leaving untouched the microwave
spikes of solar origin, which were inferred to have durations
longer than the 100 µs accumulation time.

However, in a more recent study, using data obtained
with the EST instrument during another solar bursts featur-

ing spiky emission, and an hardware–implemented dSK spec-

trometer that was designed to integrate 20ms contigu-
ous blocks (M = 9766), with no acquisition gaps in be-
tween, Nita & Gary (2016) demonstrated that the integra-
tion blocks containing radio spikes of solar origin were

ﬂagged by the dSK 0.13% PFA detection thresholds. Using
the analysis framework detailed in §2.3, Nita & Gary (2016)
estimated that the spectral peak of one of the observed so-
lar radio spikes was characterized by a SNR ρ = 2.14± 0.11,
and a duration τ = (8.05 ± 0.30) ms, which is consistent
with theoretical expectations (Sirenko & Fleishman 2009)
and previous time–resolved observations of microwave solar
radio spikes (Rozhansky et al. 2008).

Nevertheless, to assign a Gaussian statistical model to
the observed microwave spikes, Nita & Gary (2016) had to
rely on theoretical expectations that microwave spikes of
solar emission must have a Gaussian time domain distribu-

tion, and to discard the possibility of dSK ﬂagged spikes to

represent low duty-cycle local instrumental RFI, hypothe-
sis that was ruled out by serendipitous Very Large Array
(VLA, Perley et al. 2011) simultaneous observations of the
same spikes, which independently conﬁrmed their genuine
solar origin (Chen et al. 2015).

All of the above examples indicate that, if a targeted

the same hypothetical transients considered in Figure 7, the

length in unit steps, from M = 97, up to a maximum accu-

it reaches less than unity values for the range of accumu-
lation lengths corresponding to relative duty-cycles above
50%.

Therefore, the particular example illustrated in Figure 8
demonstrates that, if the ﬁxed accumulation length of the

dSK spectrometer is tuned to a value that is shorter than

twice the expected duration of a coherent transient, while
longer than the expected duration of a Gaussian transient,
there is a non-zero probability of random realization of an
observation that would unambiguously discriminate the sta-
tistical nature of such transients, and thus allow reliable es-
timations of their SNR and duty-cycles.

Although such particular condition may seem too re-
strictive for having wide practical applicability, we demon-
strate below that it can be straightforwardly achieved by

imposing a less restrictive condition on a ﬁxed dSK spec-

trometer accumulation length, which would be suﬃcient to
be shorter than the duration of both types of transients, in
order to provide automatic discrimination capabilities.

Indeed, given the fact that the standard S1(M ) and

S2(M ) outputs provided by an dSK spectrometer are addi-

tive quantities, they can be sequentially grouped and added
together to form the variable length accumulations S1(kM )
and S2(kM ), k being an integer, and thus generate a dis-

lation length proﬁle similar to the Gaussian or coherent

creet dSK proﬁle that would follow a continuous accumu-
dSK proﬁles illustrated in Figures 8c and 8d, as it is demon-
strated by the numerically generated dSK deviates shown in

the same panels.

This concept of Multi-Scale Spectral Kurtosis (MSSK)
analysis was originally proposed by Gary et al. (2010), and
demonstrated to eﬀectively improve the detection perfor-

mance of an dSK spectrometer in the case of RFI tran-

sients having durations close to half of the ﬁxed accu-
mulation length of the KSRBL instrument. More recently,
Nita & Gary (2016) applied the same concept to develop a
measurement technique based on ﬁtting the discreet MSSKs
proﬁles with their expected functional forms, which, within
the statistical uncertainties, provided estimates consistent
with those obtained for the same transient signals based on
the mono-scale analysis described in $2.3 and 3.3. However,
given the fact that, in this particular analysis, the ∼ 20 ms
accumulation length the EST instrument was longer than
the inferred ∼ 8 ms duration of the observed solar microwave
spikes, the corresponding MSSK proﬁles reproduced only the
region around the secondary peak of the expected functional
form, and thus the underlaying Gaussian statistics of the so-
lar microwave spikes could not been directly conﬁrmed.

From this perspective, although the classical dSK spec-

trometer design originally proposed by Nita et al. (2007) has
been proven to already provide, in the form of the S1 and S2
measured quantities, an instrumental output suitable for im-
plementing a downstream real-time MSSK analysis pipeline
capable of providing, under favourable circumstances, auto-
matic discrimination of the statistical nature of the observed
transients, to generate full length discriminatory MSSK pro-

ﬁles similar to those shown in Figure 8, a modiﬁed dSK spec-

trometer design should be considered.

Such versatile MSSK spectrometer design could involve

a hardware implemented continuous computation of dSK es-

timates that, as the accumulation evolves, would generate

sients. The range bounded by the 0.13%PFA detection thresholds

agreement between the distribution of the dSK random de-

viates and the theoretical expectations.

As illustrated in Figure 8b, although the transients have
a ﬁxed duration, their relative duty-cycle increases from 0%,
up to ∼ 91%, as an increasing portion of the transient life–
time contributes to the accumulation, and it gradually de-
creases toward 0%, as more and more transient free blocks

of the Gaussian transient (Figure 8c) features a double–peak
evolution that, for all relative duty-cycle realizations, stays

are added to the accumulation. Consequently, the dSK proﬁle
above unity. Although the dSK proﬁle of coherent transient

Gaussian or coherent dSK ﬂags as soon as one of another

transient type is unambiguously identiﬁed. If the main goal
of such instrument would be the detection and discrim-
ination of transients, the evolving accumulation could be
stopped, and the next one initiated, as soon as the transient
identiﬁcation is made, or continued up to a accumulation
length that would provide, as demonstrated by Figures 3
and 6, transient duration and SNR estimates having the de-
sired level of accuracy.

However, if a ﬁxed accumulation lengthy is preferred,
the MSSK spectrometer design could include transient coun-
ters that, for each ﬁxed accumulation, would provide two ad-
ditional data outputs representing counts of detected Gaus-
sian and coherent transients, if any. If the coherent transients
are believed to be exclusively generated by RFI, while the
coherent transients to be generated by astronomical sources,
this additional information could be subsequently used to
safely ﬁlter out the accumulations aﬀected by RFI, while
preserving the accumulations containing contributions from
Gaussian transients shorter than the integration time.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We obtained analytical expressions that provide biased es-

timations of the true mean and variance of the dSK dis-

tributions in two special cases of spectral transients mixed
with a Gaussian time domain background, as functions of
their signal-to-noise ratio, and duty-cycle relative o the in-
strumental accumulation time. We investigated the bias of
these approximations and their transient detection perfor-
mance by means of Monte-Carlo simulations.

formance may be signiﬁcantly increased, and the bias of

We demonstrated that the dSK transient detection per-
dSK –based estimates may be signiﬁcantly reduced, by in-

creasing the accumulation length. We also developed an an-
alytical workﬂow leading to estimates of the SNR and duty-
cycle of such transients, and their standard-equivalent sta-
tistical deviations.

We investigated the accuracy of these estimates and
found that, although their statistical uncertainties may vary
as function of the SNR and duty-cycle, they can be reduced
as low as a few percent by increasing the instrumental ac-
cumulation length.

We described a practical adaptive approach that, even
for a ﬁxed accumulation length, may improve the transient
detection performance and reduce the statistical uncertain-
ties of the SNR and duty-cycle estimates, by taking full ad-

trometer design.

We suggested an original multiscale dSK spectrometer

design optimized for real-time detection, classiﬁcation, and
analysis of various transient astronomical signals generated
by ﬂaring stars, pulsars, and extragalactic sources, including
the elusive Fast Radio Burst transients (Keane et al. 2016).
Nevertheless, such design may also be considered for the
purpose of investigating the existence of coherent natural or
artiﬁcial astronomical signals, which could be facilitated by
a higher order statistics spectrometer as the one proposed
here (Melrose 2009).
