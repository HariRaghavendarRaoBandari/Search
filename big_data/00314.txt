We investigate photon merging and splitting processes in inhomogeneous, slowly varying elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds. Our study is based on the three-photon polarization tensor following from the
Heisenberg-Euler eﬀective action. We put special emphasis on deviations from the well-known
constant ﬁeld results, also revisiting the selection rules for these processes.
In the context of
high-intensity laser facilities, we analytically determine compact expressions for the number of
merged/split photons as obtained in the focal spots of intense laser beams. For the parameter
range of a typical petawatt class laser system as pump and a terawatt class laser as probe, we
provide estimates for the numbers of signal photons attainable in an actual experiment. The com-
bination of frequency upshifting, polarization dependence and scattering oﬀ the inhomogeneities
renders photon merging an ideal signature for the experimental exploration of nonlinear quantum
vacuum properties.

INTRODUCTION

The vacuum of quantum electrodynamics (QED) acquires properties akin to those of ordinary polarizable matter
when subjected to strong electromagnetic ﬁelds [1–3]. These ﬁelds can couple to electron-positron ﬂuctuations inducing
nonlinear interactions (for reviews, see [4–12]). The spatial and temporal scale associated to these electron-positron
ﬂuctuations is set by the Compton wavelength λC = 1/m ≈ 3.86 × 10−13m and the Compton time τC = 1/m ≈
1.29 × 10−21s of the electron respectively, where m ≈ 511keV denotes the electron mass. At leading order in the ﬁeld
strengths prominent signatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearities such as vacuum magnetic birefringence [13–15] and
direct light-by-light scattering [1, 16] are mediated by an eﬀective four-photon interaction.

The resulting nonlinear interactions among laboratory electromagnetic ﬁelds are suppressed by powers of the ﬁeld
strength ratio E/Ecr, with E denoting the electric/magnetic ﬁeld amplitude and Ecr = m2/e ≈ 1.3· 1018V/m ≈ 4· 109T
the critical ﬁeld strength. Hence, experimental veriﬁcations [17, 18] have so far been limited to high-energy experiments
probing vacuum nonlinearities in the strong Coulomb ﬁelds in the vicinity of highly charged ions (Delbr¨uck-scattering
[19, 20] and photon splitting [21, 22]). Vacuum nonlinearities in macroscopic electromagnetic ﬁelds have not been
directly veriﬁed so far. Direct searches of vacuum magnetic birefringence in macroscopic magnetic ﬁelds [23, 24] for
instance, have already demonstrated that a combination of both high ﬁeld strength as well as a high signal detection
sensitivity will eventually be needed for a ﬁrst discovery, see [25] for a recent proposal.

On the other hand, recent technological advances in the development of high-intensity lasers have begun to access
new extreme-ﬁeld territory. The perspective to directly probe quantum vacuum nonlinearities in all-optical pump-
probe type set-ups is most promising: one high-intensity laser (“pump”) generates a strong electromagnetic ﬁeld
pulse polarizing the quantum vacuum in its focus, which is then probed by a second high-intensity laser. A prominent
example is the fundamental physics program within the HIBEF project [26], which plans to combine a near-infrared
petawatt (PW) laser as pump and the European XFEL as probe laser aiming to detect vacuum birefringence [27–29],
see also [30, 31] for related work. While the advantage of using ultra-intense lasers is obvious from the accessible ﬁeld
strengths, important progress also has been made on the detection side in the form of high-purity x-ray polarimetry
[32]. Further attractive theoretical proposals have focused on optical signatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearities
based on interference eﬀects [33–35], photon-photon scattering in the form of laser-pulse collisions [36–38] and quantum
reﬂection [39].

In some of these studies, a new ingredient in addition to extreme ﬁelds and high detection eﬃciencies has been
identiﬁed: as laser pulses feature an intrinsic spatio-temporal structure, these spacetime inhomogeneities allow for
a richer variety of quantum vacuum signatures that remains invisible in the idealized theoretical limit of constant
homogeneous ﬁelds.

To this end, recently a representation of the one-loop photon polarization tensor Πµν (k, k′) (photon two-point
function) in the limit of low energies and momenta and for slowly varying but otherwise arbitrary electromagnetic
ﬁeld inhomogeneities has been derived [40]. Note that essentially all macroscopic electromagnetic ﬁelds attainable in
the laboratory fall into this category, as they vary on scales much larger than the Compton wavelength and time of
the electron. This result facilitates a straightforward investigation of photon propagation eﬀects in high-intensity laser

2

ﬁelds. Whereas constant electromagnetic ﬁelds only aﬀect a probe photon’s polarization properties, inhomogeneous
ﬁelds may additionally alter its frequency and wave vector, which can be employed to physically separate the (tiny)
amount of photons carrying the signature from a large background consisting of probe photons unaﬀected by quantum
vacuum nonlinearities; inhomogeneities thus become the key ingredient for some phenomena such as quantum reﬂection
[39].

Besides propagation eﬀects, photons in strong electromagnetic ﬁelds can also experience splitting [15, 21, 41–48] and
merging [49–51]. Photon splitting describes processes where a single photon splits into two or more outgoing photons
under the inﬂuence of an external electromagnetic ﬁeld. Photon merging can be viewed as the inverse process: two
or more photons merge under the inﬂuence of the external ﬁeld, yielding a single outgoing photon. The ﬁrst detailed
investigation of photon splitting has been performed by Adler in 1971 [21], who considered this process in a constant,
purely magnetic background ﬁeld.

In this work we aim at adopting the strategy devised in [28, 40, 52] to study photon splitting and merging in the
strong, inhomogeneous electromagnetic ﬁelds attainable with high-intensity laser experiments. For this, we start in
Sect. II by deriving the “three-photon polarization tensor” Πµνρ(k, k′, k′′) to one-loop order in the limit of low energies
and momenta and for weakly-varying but otherwise arbitrary electromagnetic ﬁeld inhomogeneities. This quantity
describes the eﬀective interaction between three photon ﬁelds facilitated by vacuum ﬂuctuations in the presence of
external electromagnetic ﬁelds. It accounts for couplings to the external ﬁeld to all orders. We furthermore detail on
how to determine the amplitudes and numbers of signal photons for the splitting and merging processes. In Sect. III,
we analyze the polarization properties and selection rules for photon splitting and merging. More speciﬁcally, we focus
on the special class of ﬁeld inhomogeneities characterized by unidirectional orthogonal electric and magnetic ﬁelds
of equal strength, but featuring arbitrary ﬁeld amplitude proﬁles. In Sect. IV, we consider a speciﬁc ﬁeld amplitude
proﬁle and compare the magnitudes of the numbers of photons experiencing photon splitting and merging in this ﬁeld
inhomogeneity. Finally, we provide estimates for the number of accessible signal photons from the photon merging
process for realistic laser parameters. We ﬁnish with a conclusion in Sect. V.

II. THE THREE-PHOTON POLARIZATION TENSOR IN AN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD

INHOMOGENEITY

The goal of this article is to study photon splitting and merging in an all-optical experiment, where both pump and
probe ﬁelds are provided by lasers. We consider a macroscopic “probe” photon ﬁeld aρ(q) traversing an electromagnetic
“pump“ ﬁeld conﬁguration described by the ﬁeld-strength proﬁle F µν(x). The nonlinear interactions between the
pump and probe ﬁelds may induce outgoing signal photons via the eﬀective interactions of the probe and pump ﬁelds.
Each signal photon is characterized by its four-momentum kµ and polarization four-vector ǫ∗(p)
(k), where p labels
the two transverse photon polarizations. For photon splitting we study the process linear in the probe photon ﬁeld
giving rise to two outgoing signal photons. Conversely, for photon merging we consider the process quadratic in the
(k′, k′′) for photons

photon beam and the signal photons to be speciﬁed later. We use “all-outgoing” sign conventions for the momentum
arguments of Πρση. At one loop-order, the three-photon polarization tensor quantiﬁes the eﬀective coupling of three
photon ﬁelds mediated by an electron-positron loop. At this stage, Πρση accounts for the coupling to the ﬁeld
inhomogeneity F µν (x) to all orders, see Fig. 1. Throughout the paper we work in Heaviside-Lorentz units, setting

The physical information about the splitting and merging processes in Eqs. (1) and (2) is encoded in the three-
photon polarization tensor. At present, no exact analytical results for the three-photon polarization tensor for arbitrary
momentum transfers and background ﬁeld inhomogeneities are known. At one-loop order and for generic momentum
transfers, exact results for two classes of background ﬁeld conﬁgurations are available. The ﬁrst class comprises uniform
electromagnetic ﬁelds: Papanyan and Ritus [42, 43] derived a parameter integral representation of the three-photon
polarization tensor in “constant-crossed” ﬁelds, i.e.
for orthogonal constant electric and magnetic ﬁelds of equal
amplitude |E| = |B| =: E. For this setting, the ﬁeld invariants F = 1
∗F µν =
−E·B vanish; ∗F µν = 1
2 ǫµναβFαβ denotes the dual ﬁeld strength tensor. Later, splitting amplitudes valid for arbitrary
photon energies have been derived in constant, but generically oriented electromagnetic ﬁelds [45]. Energy-momentum
conservation in constant ﬁelds implies that all three photons propagate collinearly. As a consequence, an expansion
, i.e., arising from a hexagon diagram in

m2(cid:1)3
of the amplitude in the background ﬁeld strength starts with terms ∝ (cid:0) eE
The second class of background ﬁeld conﬁgurations encompasses plane-wave backgrounds with vector potential
Aµ(κx), where κµ = (|κκκ|, κκκ) denotes the four-momentum of the plane wave. Photon splitting amplitudes for arbitrary
photon energies in this class of background ﬁelds have been derived in [48]. Recall that photon splitting amplitudes
amount to on-shell matrix elements of the three-photon photon polarization tensor. In this conﬁguration, the probe
photons can exchange energy and momentum with the background ﬁeld, and an expansion in the background ﬁeld

accordance with the Adler theorem [21]. This will also become manifest in our results below.

strength hence generically starts with terms ∝ (cid:0) eE

m2(cid:1), corresponding to box diagrams. For small angles between the

photon momenta, splitting amplitudes have also been calculated in Coulomb ﬁelds [22].

A study of photon splitting and merging in generic background ﬁeld inhomogeneities may eventually require ded-
icated numerical eﬀorts, see, e.g., [53]. However, in the present work we conﬁne ourselves to ﬁeld inhomogeneities
whose spatial and temporal variation, w and τ , are large compared to the spatial and temporal Compton scale of
the electron-positron loop, i.e., w ≫ λC and τ ≫ τC . These slowly varying ﬁelds mark the regime of the locally
constant ﬁeld approximation (LCFA). As a matter of fact, practically all current and proposed all-optical probes of
QED vacuum nonlinearities in macroscopic ﬁelds fall into this category.

The LCFA corresponds to treating the microscopic quantum ﬂuctuations as propagating in a constant ﬁeld at each
point in spacetime. This culminates in the eﬀective Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian L(x|F ) which is a local function of
spacetime. On the macroscopic level, this Lagrangian can now be applied locally. In the present work, we use it to
calculate the three-photon polarization tensor for manifestly inhomogeneous background ﬁeld proﬁles following the
strategy of [40]. For strictly constant background ﬁelds, an analogous idea has originally been adopted by Adler [21]
and Bialynicka-Birula [15] in the 1970s to study photon splitting. Still, it is important to realize that the same line or

4

reasoning also applies to slowly varying ﬁelds with parametrically suppressed errors which are quantiﬁed below. The
photon polarization tensor derived in this way is manifestly restricted to low four-momentum transfers; i.e., also the
probe photons have to be slowly varying. Let us emphasize that this procedure manifestly preserves gauge invariance
and therefore retains complete information about the polarization properties of the involved photons for any given
slowly varying background ﬁeld inhomogeneity.

Our starting point is the one-loop eﬀective action Sint(F, f ) = Rx L(x|F + f ), mediating eﬀective interactions
between probe photon ﬁelds aµ(x), with ﬁeld strength tensor f µν(x), in a background ﬁeld inhomogeneity with ﬁeld
strength tensor F µν(x). It is obtained from the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian for constant ﬁelds, which only depends
on the ﬁeld strength tensor F µν ,1 by substituting F µν → F µν(x) + f µν (x), cf. [40]. Correspondingly, the eﬀective
interactions among the probe photons can be seen as generated by derivatives of the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian.

where S(l)
int contains the eﬀective interaction between l photons. To keep the notation compact, we have omitted the
spacetime arguments of the ﬁelds. As a consequence of Furry’s theorem, only an even number of contractions of
F µν (x) and f µν(x) may constitute building blocks of the Lagrangian. On the level of the action, the LCFA neglects
derivatives of the ﬁeld strength tensors which are generic constituents of the exact eﬀective Lagrangian. Derivatives of
the ﬁelds in position space translate to multiplications of the ﬁelds in momentum space with their typical momentum

the third order term S(3)
int encodes three-photon interactions such as splitting and merging to be considered here. The
three-photon polarization tensor in momentum space is now easily inferred from S(3)
int . Employing the momentum space

2 . Due to CP invariance, this Lagrangian is an even function
of G. The derivatives with respect to F and G in Eq. (6) can now be calculated from Eq. (7). For either purely
electric or purely magnetic ﬁelds, or alternatively for orthogonal electric and magnetic ﬁelds the ﬁeld invariant G
vanishes, and the proper-time integrals can be performed analytically. This leads to a representation of the one-loop
Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian and its derivatives in terms of Γ- and Hurwitz ζ-functions (cf. [4, 5, 40, 55]). Hence, for
this class of conﬁgurations explicit analytical insights into the strong-ﬁeld limit are possible.

In the following, we concentrate on the case of crossed-ﬁelds with E · B = 0 and |E| = |B| =: E. This conﬁguration
is of particular importance as it can be employed to describe the electromagnetic ﬁelds delivered by high-intensity
lasers; cf. Section IV. Since both ﬁeld invariants vanish in this case, F = G = 0, it is useful to perform a weak ﬁeld
expansion of the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian (7),

For generic slowly varying backgrounds, neglecting higher-order expansion terms is equivalent to a weak-ﬁeld limit,
eE
m2 ≪ 1, with E being a characteristic ﬁeld strength scale of the background. Working with Eqs. (8), (9) corresponds
to the same level of accuracy as has recently been used for a study of vacuum higher-harmonic generation in a slowly
varying background [56] or constant crossed-ﬁeld background in the shock regime [57] based on the quantum equations
of motion. For general crossed-ﬁeld conﬁgurations considered here, higher-order terms vanish identically and the terms
written explicitly in Eq. (9) constitute the full result within the LCFA. The corresponding parametric analysis can
be made more rigorously: for F = G = 0, the diﬀerent contributions to the three-photon polarization tensor scale as

m2(cid:1)(cid:3) for the term linear in E, and as ∼ m v

, with n ∈ N+, for higher powers
of E. As the LCFA adopted here neglects contributions ∼ O(cid:0) v2
m2(cid:1), terms with n > 1 are not accounted for in the
corresponding three-photon polarization tensor. Hence, in the limit of F = G = 0 we ﬁnd

employing the short-hand notation (k ˆF )ρ := kν ˆF νρ. Note that Eq. (10) is spanned by just 10 tensor structures, as
further 10 tensor structures have been eliminated by the 10 independent equations of the Ward identity. Additionally,
we have introduced the normalized ﬁeld strength tensor ˆF µν as F µν = ˆF µνE, which is independent of x for unidirec-
tional ﬁelds, i.e., E = ˆeE E(x) and B = ˆeB E(x). This is, e.g., the case for linearly polarized Gaussian laser beams in
the paraxial approximation.
For inhomogeneities with suﬃciently simple proﬁles, the space-time integration can be performed straightforwardly.
For constant backgrounds E(x) = E, this yields delta functions (2π)4δ(4)(k + k′ + k′′) in Eq. (10) which enforce energy
and momentum conservation. It is particularly instructive to study the constant-ﬁeld limit for the case where kµ, k′µ
and k′′µ are four-momenta describing real photons. In this case, we have kµ = ˆkµω, with photon frequency ω = |k|
and normalized four-momentum ˆkµ = (1, ˆk). The unit vector ˆk = k/ω points into the photon propagation direction;
in turn ˆkµ is frequency independent, solely representing the propagation geometry. Accounting for the relative sign
for in- and outgoing photons [cf. Eqs. (1) and (2)], all three photons propagate collinearly in the constant-ﬁeld case,
(1) (ˆk,−ˆk′,−ˆk′′) vanishes. Hence, in
and the combination δ(4)(−k + k′ + k′′)cρση
constant ﬁelds the lowest-order contributions to three-photon amplitudes are of O(cid:0)( eE
m2 )3(cid:1), which is a manifestation
of the Adler theorem [21]. Beyond the constant-ﬁeld limit, however, ﬁrst-order contributions are expected to become
relevant if inhomogeneities facilitate an appreciable four-momentum transfer between the background ﬁeld and the
probe photons. This can give rise to interactions among probe photons whose directions of propagation diﬀer notably
from each other.

In order to explicitly evaluate the number of signal photons from splitting or merging from the amplitudes (1)

III. POLARIZATION PROPERTIES IN THE CROSSED-FIELD CASE

For the remainder of this work we assume a unidirectional background ﬁeld inhomogeneity with orthogonal electric
and magnetic ﬁelds, characterized by the unit vectors ˆeE and ˆeB respectively. We assume ˆeE = cos ϕ ˆex + sin ϕ ˆey
and ˆeB = ˆeE(cid:12)(cid:12)ϕ→ϕ+ π
. The direction of the ﬁeld vectors in the x-y plane is parametrized by the angle ϕ ∈ [0, 2π) (see
Fig. 2). It is convenient to introduce the four-vector κµ = (1, ˆeE × ˆeB) = (1, ˆez); its spatial components correspond
to the normalized Poynting vector of the background ﬁeld. In order to describe the propagation and polarization
properties of the probe photons eﬃciently, we switch to spherical coordinates. A probe photon’s four-momentum
is then given by kµ = ω(1, ˆk), where ˆk = (cos φ sin θ, sin φ sin θ, cos θ). Without loss of generality, we deﬁne its

It is straightforward to verify that ˆk and ǫǫǫ(1)(k) are orthogonal for any angle γ. The corresponding second perpendic-
ular polarization mode hence is given by ǫ(2)
. The photon state is now completely characterized
by its energy ω and the set of parameters Θ := {θ, φ, γ}. The angle γ ∈ [0, 2π) determines the orientation of the
trihedron composed of ˆk, ǫǫǫ(1)(k) and ǫǫǫ(2)(k). For γ = 0, the polarization vector ǫǫǫ(1)(k) lies in the x-y plane, while
ǫǫǫ(2)(k) lies in the plane spanned by ˆez and ˆk, cf. Fig. 2. For θ = {0, π} both polarization vectors lie in the x-y plane.
Since we have left the angle γ in the deﬁnition of ǫǫǫ(1)(k) unspeciﬁed, it actually suﬃces to perform all the subsequent
calculations exclusively for the choice of p = p′ = p′′ = 1 in order to study the interactions of linearly polarized photon
beams. All other linear photon polarizations can be addressed by shifting the angles γ, γ′ and γ′′ accordingly.

FIG. 2. Left: Geometry of photon merging in a localized background ﬁeld inhomogeneity with mutually perpendicular E,
B and κκκ ∼ ˆez for the particular choice of ϕ = 0 (cf. main text). In this ﬁeld conﬁguration, two incoming probe photons
with momenta k′ and k′′ may merge into one photon with momentum k. For photon splitting (not depicted) the roles are
reversed: An incident photon with momentum k may split into two photons with momenta k′ and k′′. The polarization degrees
of freedom of the photons are spanned by the unit vectors ǫǫǫ(1)(q) and ǫǫǫ(2)(q), where q ∈ {k, k′, k′′}. This ﬁgure depicts the
special case where the incident photons propagate in the x-z plane, and γ′ = γ′′ = 0. Right: The convention for the trihedron
composed of ˆk, ǫǫǫ(1)(k) and ǫǫǫ(2)(k) is such that for γ = 0 the polarization vector ǫǫǫ(1)(k) lies in the x-y plane (shaded area).

Equations (13) and (14) require us to calculate contractions of photon polarization vectors with the polarization
tensor. To this end, we deﬁne the polarization overlap functions as the contraction of the photon polarization vectors
with the tensor structures in Eqs. (11) and (12),

amplitudes in external ﬁelds, it is a well-known fact that photon propagation is not modiﬁed in weak crossed-ﬁeld
backgrounds, if (ˆk, ˆeE, ˆeB) form a basis of a right-handed orthogonal coordinate system [5]. Since in our case the

Let us brieﬂy investigate the selection rules for the photon merging and splitting processes. These are a direct
consequence of the structure of the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian being an even function of G as dictated by the CP
invariance of QED. This exerts a strong inﬂuence on the structure of the three-photon polarization tensor (10); cf.
also Eq. (6).

Considering the case of unidirectional backgrounds, the normalized ﬁeld strength tensor ˆF µν is x independent.
For a given four-momentum kµ, one can then construct four independent four-vectors: kµ, ( ˆF 2k)µ, (k∗ ˆF )µ and
(k ˆF )µ. The latter two span the physical polarization eigenmodes of a probe photon of momentum kµ. We call the
polarization aµ ∼ (k∗ ˆF )µ the “slow” (s) mode of propagation, since the external ﬁeld reduces its phase velocity to
v(s)
)2 (where ρ is a purely geometrical factor [5]). Correspondingly, (k ˆF )µ describes the “fast” (f)
ph ≃ 1 − 14
mode with v(f)
ph . As (k∗ ˆF )µ(k ˆF )µ = 0, the 10 tensor structures (11) and (12) give rise to
selection rules which determine the allowed interactions between in- and outgoing probe photons in the slow and fast
mode.

Table I lists the resulting selection rules. Photon splitting and merging are both governed by the same selection
rules, since they are both inferred from the same tensor structures cρση
(n) (k, k′, k′′), cf. Eqs. (11) and (12). Processes
which are cubic in the background ﬁeld (n = 3) feature selection rules which are well-known from photon splitting
and merging in constant ﬁelds [43]: only processes involving either three fast, or one fast and two slow photons are
permitted in this case.

However, inhomogeneous backgrounds allow for momentum transfers to probe photons. This gives rise to processes
linear in the background ﬁeld which potentially dominate over processes cubic in the background. The function
cρση
(1) (k, k′, k′′) then determines the leading order polarization properties, and the restrictions on the selection rules of
the process cubic in the background ﬁeld are lifted, see Table I (middle column).

For the explicit calculations performed in this work, we have employed the four-vectors ǫ(p)

µ (k) to specify the
polarization states of the incoming and outgoing probe photons. In contrast to (k∗ ˆF )µ and (k ˆF )µ, the ǫ(p)
µ (k) form
a polarization basis independently of the background. Of course, we can always tune a given polarization vector
ǫ(1)
µ (k) to either the slow or the fast mode by adjusting the angle γ. Generically, the appropriate choice of γ depends
on the propagation direction ˆk of the considered photon. A notable exception is obtained by restricting the photon
propagation to the x-z plane and specializing the background ﬁeld polarization to ϕ = 0. In this case, the background
electric ﬁeld points along ˆex, and the magnetic ﬁeld along ˆey as in Fig. 2. In this case we ﬁnd that the choice of γ = 0

IV. PHOTON MERGING AND SPLITTING IN A LOCALIZED BACKGROUND INHOMOGENEITY

In what follows, we specialize the background inhomogeneity to resemble the electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in
the focal spot of a pulsed high-intensity laser beam, propagating along the z direction with normalized four-wavevector
κµ (cf. Sec. III above). We assume a linearly polarized beam with unidirectional perpendicular electric and magnetic
ﬁelds of equal amplitude proﬁle (see Fig. 2),

where r = px2 + y2. Equation (19) mimics the proﬁle of a pulsed laser beam of peak ﬁeld amplitude E, frequency
Ω and pulse duration τ , which is focussed around z = 0. The transversal proﬁle is a Gaussian with 1
e -width w0,
resembling the transversal proﬁle of a Gaussian laser beam. We neglect beam divergence eﬀects and assume this
width to be constant along the beam. This can be justiﬁed by the fact that the considered phenomena become sizable
only within the Rayleigh range of the focussed laser beam. Here, beam widening eﬀects are small, and the beam width
can be considered as approximately constant. The length wz/2 mimics the Rayleigh length of the pump laser beam.

Note that the real longitudinal proﬁle of a Gaussian beam is the square root of a Lorentzian (∝ 1/p1 + (2z/wz)2)

rather than a Gaussian, as has been chosen here. Nevertheless, the qualitative features of photon splitting and merging
are expected to result in quantitatively comparable eﬀects for both types of proﬁles. The exponential proﬁle simply
helps us to obtain more compact formulae due to the appearance of Gaussian integrals in Eq. (10).

Inserting the ﬁeld proﬁle Eq. (19) into the polarization tensor Eq. (10), and plugging the resulting expression into

Here, qµ := kµ − k′µ − k′′µ denotes the four-momentum exchange of the probe and signal photons. The value of qµ
measures the deviation from the four-momentum conservation law in constant background ﬁelds, qµ|const. bg. = 0.
The contribution proportional to c(1) in Eq.
(20) encodes the process linear in the background: the pump laser
ﬁeld exchanges a single photon of frequency Ω with the probe photon ﬁelds. The contribution proportional to c(3)
encodes the process cubic in the pump ﬁeld amplitude. Here the exchange of three pump photons facilitates possible
energy transfers of {3Ω, Ω,−Ω,−3Ω} between the pump laser pulse and the probe photon beams. On the level of the
m2(cid:1)2
three-photon amplitude, the latter process is generically suppressed by a factor of (cid:0) eE
compared with the linear
process. However, the exponential suppression of splitting and merging as a function of the four-momentum transfer
is smaller for the cubic than for the linear process, as is visible from the prefactors ( 1
48 ) vs. ( 1
16 ). This allows for
kinematical situations where the cubic processes dominate over the linear ones.

Furthermore, the momentum dependences in the exponentials in Eq. (20) give ﬁrst insights into the emission
characteristics of photon splitting and merging. A maximum of induced signal photons occurs for those energy and
angle parameters which lead to a vanishing argument of one of the exponential functions in Eq. (20). This happens
if the interacting photons fulﬁll energy conservation ω − ω′ − ω′′ + ℓΩ = 0, with ℓ ∈ {−3,−1, 1, 3}. A speciﬁc set of
energies then results in a relation for the corresponding polar angles {θ, θ′, θ′′}: ω cos θ + ℓΩ = ω′ cos θ′ + ω′′ cos θ′′
from z-momentum conservation. Finally, the propagation characteristics in the x-y plane transversal to the pump
laser beam are determined by the corresponding momentum conservation kx − k′
On the one hand, the microscopic amplitudes for photon splitting and merging coincide, as they are fully determined
by the three-photon polarization tensor. On the other hand, completely diﬀerent scaling behaviors occur for the
number of signal photons evaluated from Eqs. (13) and (14): photon merging is quadratic in the macroscopic probe
photon ﬁelds, whereas photon splitting is linear in the probe photon ﬁeld. To linear order in the pump ﬁeld, the ratio
of NSplit to NMerg thus scales as NSplit
; cf. also Eq. (20). Here, Ein denotes the ﬁeld strength of each
incoming probe photon ﬁeld, and v is the typical momentum scale of the probe photons. In the following, we show
that set-ups with high-intensity lasers in the optical regime ( v
m ≪ 1) strongly favor the merging process because of
a substantially diﬀerent phase space for the signal photons as well as the scaling with the incoming probe photon
currents.

To make contact with an experimental set-up, we assume the inhomogeneous pump ﬁeld to be generated by a
high-intensity laser, which is focussed down to the diﬀraction limit (attainable with a focusing aperture with f # = 1).
In this case, the diameter of the pump beam in its focus is given by twice its wavelength λpump = 2π
Ω , such that
w0 = 2λpump. Likewise, we identify wz with twice the Rayleigh length of a Gaussian beam, i.e. wz = 2zR = 2πλpump.
The pulse duration is given by τ = τpump. Assuming that the eﬀective focal area contains 86% of the laser energy W
( 1
e2 -criterion), we estimate the peak ﬁeld-strength of the pump as

E 2 = 2hIi ≈ 2

0.86 W

τ σ

,

(21)

with focal area σ ≈ πλ2. We employ Eq. (21) to determine the ﬁeld strength of the pump laser for given laser param-
eters. The analogous relation for the probe beams is used to determine the photon current densities J, introduced in
Eqs. (13)-(14). Given the probe laser parameters such as pulse energy Wprobe, frequency ωprobe = 2π
and pulse
λprobe
duration τprobe, we obtain J = 0.86
. Note that the plane-wave probe picture is only fully adequate for
2π2
τprobe ≥ τpump. Otherwise corrections because of the ﬁnite time overlap of the pump and probe laser pulses have to
be taken into account.
For a ﬁrst estimate, we adopt the parameters of state-of-the-art high-intensity laser facilities, namely two identical,
fully synchronized petawatt-class laser systems of wavelength λbeam = 800nm ≈ 4.06eV−1, and pulse duration τbeam =
25fs ≈ 38.0eV−1. Note that these parameters match the parameters of the laser system to be installed at ELI-NP
[58]. We assume an energy of Wbeam = 25J ≈ 1.56· 1020eV for each beam, which corresponds to a laser power of 1PW

τprobe λprobe

Wprobe

11

2 λbeam and Wprobe = 1

per beam. Note that this can be considered as a rather conservative estimate as the ELI-NP lasers are designed as
10PW systems. One of these lasers is assumed to constitute the pump, and the second one is assumed to be frequency
doubled and split into two probe beams of equal power. The energy loss for frequency-doubling is estimated as 50%,
while the pulse duration is considered as unaﬀected by the frequency-doubling process. For each of the two probe
beams we thus have τprobe = τbeam, λprobe = 1
4 Wbeam. Of course, the parameters of the pump
are τpump = τbeam, λpump = λbeam, and Wpump = Wbeam. The fact that such a set-up greatly favors photon merging
over splitting becomes obvious from the ratio of the induced signal photons, NSplit
probe ∼ 10−16 (cf. above).
For the remainder, we therefore exclusively focus on photon merging. We only retain contributions in Eq. (20)
which are of ﬁrst order in the pump, and neglect third-order terms. The latter are sub-leading for the considered
kinematical settings dictated by requirement that the argument of the exponential function in the second line of
Eq. (20) should vanish. The total number of merged photons arises from Eq. (20) (second line) by integrating over
all possible energies of the merged photons, ω = 0...∞. Energy conservation requires the merged photon to have a
ﬁnal energy of ≈ 2ωprobe ± Ω = (4 ± 1)ωbeam, corresponding to the absorption/emission of one photon with energy Ω
from/to the pump laser ﬁeld. For the speciﬁc beam conﬁguration considered below, the argument in the exponential
function of Eq. (20) can only vanish for the emission process. Hence, the induced signal photons will predominantly
be emitted with an energy of ω ≈ 2ωprobe − Ω = 3ωbeam = 4.6eV. The fact that the signal photon is an odd harmonic
of the probe can be used for eﬃcient ﬁltering and detection techniques for optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio.

conﬁguration sketched on right panel driven by two 1PW-class lasers as described in the main text. In the vicinity of the focal
spot of a Gaussian beam, curvature eﬀects can be neglected, justifying the simpler pump-beam proﬁle (19) employed in this
work (indicated by the dashed lines). The result includes an integration over the complete energy range and the full solid angle
of the induced merged photons. The probe beams have been chosen to propagate in the x-z plane, i.e. φ′ = 0, φ′′ = 0, and
θ′ = π (cf. also Fig. 2). The polarization of the pump beam is chosen as ϕ = 0. The plot depicts the number of merged photons
for various polarization assignments of the probe photons, allowed according to the selection rules in Table I (right). For two
10PW driver lasers, the number of merged photons increases by a factor of 1000.

For simplicity, we limit ourselves now to pump and probe beam propagation in the x-z plane; cf. also Tab. I (right
column). Figure 3 shows the total number of merged photons for the present set-up. Here, one probe beam with wave
vector k′ counter-propagates the pump laser beam, and the second probe beam with wave vector k′′ enters under an
angle of θ′′. The geometry is depicted in the right panel of Fig. 3. As is visible in the left panel of Fig. 3, this set-up
yields a sizable total number of merged photons near the optimum incoming angle of θ′′ ≈ 1.23rad. The number of
merged photons depends strongly on the polarization modes of the probe photons, with a maximum given for the
parameter choice γ = 0 for the merged photon, and γ′ = 0 and γ′′ = π
2 for the probe photons. As we limit ourselves
to the x-z plane and ϕ = 0, this choice can be identiﬁed with the process s′, f′′ → s (cf. Tab. I). As the number of
merged signal photons scales as ∼ W 3
beam, our results can straightforwardly be rescaled to the design parameters of
ELI-NP featuring two 10PW laser beams by multiplying with a factor of 1000.

Figure 4 displays the emission characteristics for the optimum geometry with θ′′ = 1.23rad as inferred from Fig. 3.
The left panel shows the distribution of merged photons as a function of the polar angle θ, while the right panel
depicts the distribution as a function of φ.

FIG. 4. Emission characteristics of the attainable number of merged photons for our set-up driven by two 1PW-class lasers. The
parameters of the incoming beams are chosen as θ′ = π, φ′ = 0, θ′′ = 1.23rad and φ′′ = 0; the polarization of the pump beam is
ϕ = 0. The angle θ′′ maximizing the merged photon yield is visible in Fig. 3. Left panel: diﬀerential photon number dNMerg(θ)
as a function of the polar angle θ, with the corresponding energy and φ integrations performed over the full parameter regime.
Right panel: dNMerg(φ) as a function of the polar angle φ, with the corresponding energy and polar angle integrals performed
over their full parameter regimes. From these plots we infer that the merged signal photons are predominantly emitted in the
x-z plane, at an outgoing polar angle of θ ≈ 2.46rad. For two 10PW driver lasers, the number of merged photons increases by
a factor of 1000.

range of the correspondingly remaining angle as well as the signal photon energy. These plots imply that the merged
photons are emitted into a rather small solid angle element: they predominantly propagate in the x-z plane at an
outgoing polar angle of θ ≈ 2.46rad (this result is illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 3, where the dashed vector k
has been chosen correspondingly). Most notably, for our speciﬁc set-up the requirements of momentum and energy
conservation yield a maximum emission of signal photons into regions where the ﬁelds of both the pump and the probe
beams essentially vanish. Such a constellation is most favorable for optimizing the signal to noise ratio. Note that a
Gaussian beam focussed down to the diﬀraction limit, as exemplarily depicted in Fig. 3 (right panel), has an opening
angle of 1/π ≈ 0.31rad. The resulting emission of the signal into the “free ﬁeld” area together with the comparatively
large number of signal photons makes this scenario an ideal candidate to experimentally verify the nonlinear nature
of the quantum vacuum. Note that the laser parameters employed here resemble the parameters of typical petawatt
class optical laser facilities which are currently in operation. Facilities with even more intense laser beams are being
projected and developed (see, e.g., [58–61]).

For completeness let us note that it might prove experimentally challenging to realize a set-up with two exactly
counter-propagating lasers as considered here, cf. Fig. 3 (right panel). Even though this set-up provides for a larger
number of merged photons, it might be desirable to avoid counter-propagating beams for experimental purposes.
Keeping the remaining experimental parameters ﬁxed but taking, e.g., θ′ = 3π
4 and θ′′ = 0.77rad still yields a total
number of NMerg ≈ 11.7 signal photons per laser shot (for s′,f′′ → s), emitted predominantly at θ = 1.92rad. In
summary, our merging proposal facilitates rather ﬂexible experimental realizations without ﬁne-tuning requirements
for the geometry of the incoming pump and probe beams.

Let us ﬁnally compare the all-optical conﬁguration considered here with the four-wave mixing scenario suggested in
[36, 37]. The latter scenario focuses on the mixing of three incident photon waves from the outset to address elastic
photon-photon scattering with high power lasers. Both scenarios have the use of high-intensity lasers in common
as well as the same underlying set of Feynman diagrams. A main diﬀerence is that we consider the merging of two
photon waves in a pump ﬁeld inhomogeneity which is not restricted to the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a propagating laser
beam. Our formalism generalizes straightforwardly to any inhomogeneous pump ﬁeld. Moreover, in our approach we
can naturally make contact with the constant crossed-ﬁeld limit for the pump ﬁeld conﬁguration as well as read oﬀ
the various selection rules which govern the photon merging process.

We have investigated photon merging and splitting processes in inhomogeneous, slowly varying electromagnetic
ﬁelds, based on the three-photon polarization tensor following from the Heisenberg-Euler eﬀective action. The inﬂuence

of inhomogeneities appear particularly promising in the context of high-intensity laser facilities. For the parameter
range of a typical petawatt class laser as pump and a terawatt class laser as probe, we provide estimates for the
numbers of signal photons attainable in an actual experiment. The combination of frequency upshifting, polarization
dependence and scattering oﬀ the inhomogeneities yields an inherent signal-to-background separation. This may give
rise to successful implementations of single-photon detection schemes and renders photon merging an ideal signature
for the experimental exploration of nonlinear quantum vacuum properties.

The central theoretical tool for these results is the explicit representation of the three-photon polarization tensor at
one-loop order for slowly varying, but otherwise arbitrary electromagnetic ﬁeld backgrounds. This expression allows
to analyze in detail the selection rules for photon splitting and merging in crossed ﬁelds. We have also been able to
demonstrate how the well-established restrictions arising from selection rules in constant background ﬁelds are lifted
in inhomogeneous background ﬁelds.

The framework laid out in this work is ideally suited to obtain analytical insights into three-photon interaction
processes induced by vacuum ﬂuctuations in the strong electromagnetic ﬁelds generated by high-intensity lasers. The
relevance of inhomogeneities becomes obvious from the fact that photon splitting and merging processes in constant
background ﬁelds are suppressed as (E/Ecr)6 in the ratio of the background ﬁeld strength E to the critical ﬁeld strength
Ecr. This consequence of the Adler theorem can be circumvented by inhomogeneous background ﬁelds which allow for
momentum and energy transfers between the probe photons and the background ﬁeld. As a result, the suppression is
decreased to only (E/Ecr)2.
As the our quantitative estimates for the number of attainable signal photons already yields a decent amount of
merged signal photons per laser shot – even for already existing state-of-the-art 1PW class high-intensity laser systems
– we believe that photon merging can be a good candidate to detect and investigate the optical nonlinearities of the
quantum vacuum for the ﬁrst time.
