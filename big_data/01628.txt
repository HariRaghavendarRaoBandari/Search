Using a uniﬁed approach we study the entropy of extremal black holes through the entropy of
an electrically charged thin shell. We encounter three cases in which a shell can be taken to its
own gravitational or horizon radius and become an extremal spacetime. In case 1, we use a non
extremal shell, calculate all the thermodynamics quantities including the entropy, take it to the
horizon radius, and then take the extremal limit. In case 2, we take the extremal limit and the
horizon radius limit simultaneously, i.e., as the shell approaches its horizon radius it also approaches
extremality. In case 3, we build ﬁrst an extremal shell, and then take its horizon radius. We ﬁnd
that the thermodynamic quantities in general have diﬀerent expressions in the three diﬀerent cases.
The entropy is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S = A+/4 (where A+ is the horizon area) in cases
1 and 2, and in case 3 it can be any well-behaved function of A+. The contributions from the
various thermodynamic quantities for the entropy in all three cases are distinct. Indeed, in cases 1
and 2 the limits agree in what concerns the entropy but they disagree in the behavior of all other
thermodynamic quantities. Cases 2 and 3 disagree in what concerns the entropy but agree in the
behavior of the local temperature and electric potential. Case 2 is in a sense intermediate between
cases 1 and 3. Our approach sheds light on the extremal black hole entropy issue.

INTRODUCTION

The fact that black holes possess thermodynamic prop-
erties [1–3] is arguably their brightest feature. Especially
fascinating is that black holes have entropy. For the
nonextremal black holes, it is known that its entropy
S is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, equal to A+/4,
where A+ is the horizon area. This has been put in ﬁrm
ground in the works of York and collaborators [4–7], (see
also a generalization in [8]), in a Hamiltonian formalism
[9, 10], and using quite generic matter ﬁelds [11], among
other approaches. A special kind of matter ﬁeld, thin
shells, have also been used in [12–15] to further probe
the thermodynamic properties of black holes. In partic-
ular, in [13] (see also [14, 15]), the results are based on
the fact that a general thin shell can be taken to its grav-
itational radius where one must force its temperature to
be equal to the Hawking temperature of a black hole,
otherwise back-reaction eﬀects will destroy the shell. By
doing so, the shell is seen to possess an entropy equal to
the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S = A+/4 of the corre-
spondent spacetime black hole, thus making it possible

to calculate the entropy of an extremal black hole by us-
ing an extremal shell taken to its gravitational radius.
Notwithstanding several eﬀorts, it is still unclear what is
microscopic explanation of this value in the framework
of a still lacking full quantum gravity.

Extremal black holes seem to be a diﬀerent object from
non-extremal ones. Indeed, for extremal black holes, not
only the microscopic explanation of the entropy S is ab-
sent, but even the value S itself of the entropy is un-
certain. Although some suggestions have been worked
out that yield S = 0 [16–18], the entropy of an extremal
black hole is still an open problem, as string theory claims
that it is in fact given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
S = A+/4 [19, 20], see also [21–35] on this discussion.

In Pretorius, Vollock and Israel [36] and in [37] using
matter ﬁelds, and in [38] using an extremal charged thin
matter shell, an interesting solution to the debate was
naturally deduced. It was found that the extremal black
hole entropy could be any well-behaved function of A+,
S = 0 and S = A+/4 included. Of course, one might
also obtain the entropy of an extremal black hole by ﬁrst
calculating the entropy of a non-extremal charged thin
shell [13] and then taking the extremal limit as a partic-
ular case, this giving, as expected, S = A+/4. There is
even another case, an intermediate one, when one takes
the extremal limit and the horizon radius limit simulta-
neously, i.e., as the shell approaches its horizon radius
it also approaches extremality. Therefore, it is particu-

larly important to study the consistency of the thin shell
approach in the various limits, to further strengthen the
conclusions drawn in [38]. We use the results stated in
[39, 40] that the thermal stress energy tensor correspond-
ing to a given temperature diverges in the horizon limit
unless the temperature is the Hawking temperature.

Thin shells are systems of great interest that have been
used in a number of ways in classical general relativity,
as a way to quantize gravitational systems, and concomi-
tantly in a black hole context. Classically, we mention
a variational principle found for dust shells [41], and the
collapse of electrically charged thin shells to probe space-
time features and test cosmic censorship [42]. It has also
been further used to understand in diﬀerent ways the
entropy of gravitational systems including black holes
[43, 44]. Quantically, thin shells have for instance been
used in the understanding of quantum black hole states
and Hawking radiation, see, e.g., [45–47].

The work is organized as follows. In Sec. II we give
the preliminaries necessary to discuss the various horizon
limits. We display the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics and
give the expressions for the thermodynamic quantities
that enter into it. In Sec. III we deﬁne the two variables
that are important to take the horizon limits, ε and δ. In
Sec. IV we deﬁne, through geometry, the three cases that
appear in taken the horizon limit. In Sec. V we see the
expressions for the mass and electric charge in the three
cases. In Sec. VI we ﬁnd the expressions for the surface
pressure, the electric potential, and the temperature in
the three cases. In Sec. VII we put everything together
into the ﬁrst law and ﬁnd the entropy in the three horizon
limits. In Sec. VIII we discuss the contribution of each
thermodynamic quantity to the entropy and summarize
these results in a table. In Sec. IX a discussion on the
back reaction issue is raised. In Sec. X we conclude.

It is quite interesting that the formula given in Eq. (4)
can be obtained from quite diﬀerent perspectives. In [6],
it was obtained from the action formalism approach to
black hole thermodynamics but it has another meaning
there since it applies to black holes, not to shells.
In
[7], it was rederived for bounded self-gravitating systems
using the quasilocal energy formalism. In [13], probably
for the ﬁrst time, it was obtained (i) in a pure thermo-
dynamic context, (ii) for thin shells, and (iii) using so
general assumptions as the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics
and integrability conditions only.
In [45], it had been
derived from shell’s dynamics.

Thus, inversely, the quantities M and Q can be written

in terms of (R, r+, r−). Deﬁne, k as

k(R, r+, r−) =r(cid:16)1 −

usually called the redshift function. Then M is given by

M (R, r+, r−) = R(1 − k) ,

(6)

where we have chosen the solution that gives M = m for
R large. Also

Q(R, r+, r−) = √r+ r− ,

The area of the shell is

A(R, r+, r−) = 4πR2 ,

and the gravitational area or horizon area is

II. PRELIMINARIES

A+(R, r+, r−) = 4πr2

+ ,

The study of the non-extremal charged thin shell de-
veloped in [13] involves three dynamical variables: the
radius R of the shell, its rest mass M and its charge Q.
For thermodynamics we also need the local temperature
T , the surface pressure p, and the electric potential Φ,
and then ﬁnd the entropy S. Assuming that the shell
is static, spherically symmetric and has a well deﬁned
temperature, the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is

T dS = dM + pdA − ΦdQ .

(1)

where in all calculations we use natural units, the speed
of light, the gravitational constant, the Planck constant,
and the Boltzmann constant are set to one, c = G = h =
kB = 1, respectively.

There are two other particularly useful variables which
can characterize the problem, namely the shell’s radius
R, the gravitational or horizon radius r+ and its Cauchy
radius r−, which are functions of (R, M, Q) through

r+(R, M, Q) = m +pm2 − Q2 ,
r−(R, M, Q) = m −pm2 − Q2 ,

(2)

(3)

We have written explicitly the complete functional de-
pendence (R, r+, r−) even though some quantities do
not depend on one or two of these variables in order
to show that this is a thermodynamics system. Thus,
Q(R, r+, r−) only depends on (r+, r−), A(R, r+, r−) only
depends on (R), and A+(R, r+, r−) only depends on (r+).
It will prove useful to keep the generic functional depen-
dence.

In order for the non-extremal electric charged shell to
remain static, its surface pressure must have a speciﬁc
functional form, given by [13]

p(R, r+, r−) =

R2(1 − k)2 − r+r−

16πR3k

.

(10)

The electric potential Φ of the shell must also assume
a speciﬁc form if the shell is to remain static. The in-
tegrability conditions out of ﬁrst law of thermodynamics
assert that [13]

Φ(R, r+, r−) =

c(r+, r−) − 1

R

k

√r+r− ,

(11)

where c(r+, r−) is as arbitrary function, which physically
represents the electric potential of the shell multiplied by

its charge, if it were located at inﬁnity. Additionally, we
need the non-extremal shell to have a well deﬁned electric
potential in the horizon limit. This leads to

HORIZON LIMITS

There are three physically relevant, limits. Let us see

(12)

them ﬁrst through the geometry.

c(r+, r−) =

,

and consequently

Φ(R, r+, r−) =r r−

r+s 1 − r+
1 − r−

.

(13)

Eq. (13) formally coincides with the expression (4.15)
of [6] derived for a black hole in a cavity (their φ coin-
cides with our Φ). However, in our case there is no black
hole at all. Should the condition (12) on the function
c be relaxed to an arbitrary function, we would obtain
limR→r+ Φ(R, r+, r−) = ∞, since the inﬁnities inside the
square root in the deﬁning Eq. (11) would not be can-
celed.

Assuming that the shell has a well deﬁned tempera-
ture, the integrability conditions imposed from the ﬁrst
law of thermodynamics Eq. (1) gives [13]

T (R, r+, r−) =

T0
k

,

(14)

Case 1. In this case we do r+ 6= r− and R → r+, i.e.,

δ = O(1) ,

ε → 0 .

(19)

After all the calculations are done and ﬁnished and we
have an expression for the entropy we can then take the
δ → 0 limit to get at the gravitational radius an extremal
shell. According to Eq. (17), this means to bring the
shell to its gravitational radius. It follows from (18) that
r+ 6= r−. Thus there is the horizon limit, but there is no
extremal limit, the shell remains nonextremal during the
whole process.

Case 2. In this case we do R → r+ and r+ → r−, i.e.,
(20)

δ =

ε → 0 ,

where it is assumed that the new parameter λ remains
constant in the limiting process and that it must satisfy
λ ≤ 1 due to r+ ≥ r−. The limit in which ε → 0, means
that simultaneously R → r+ and r+ → r− in such a

accompanied with the extremal one .

where T is the temperature at the shell and T0 is the
temperature seen from inﬁnity.

Case 3. In this case we do r+ = r− and R → r+, i.e.,

Now, we impose

T0 = TH (r+, r−) =

r+ − r−
4πr2

,

(15)

where TH is the Hawking temperature of an electrically
charged black hole. So T (R, r+, r−) = TH (r+,r−)

T (R, r+, r−) =

III. APPROACH TO THE EXTREMAL

HORIZON: THE VARIABLES THAT DEFINE
THE THREE EXTREMAL HORIZON LIMITS

To study independently the limit of an extremal shell
and the limit of a shell being taken to its gravitational
radius, it will prove fruitful to deﬁne the variables ε and
δ through the equations

r+
R

= ε2 ,

r−

= δ2 .

(17)

(18)

δ = ε ,

ε → 0 .

(21)

Then, r+ = r− from the very beginning. This corre-
sponds to the extremal shell. This case was analyzed in
[38], so we will simply state the results and use them for
comparison.

V. MASS AND ELECTRIC CHARGE: THE

THREE EXTREMAL HORIZON LIMITS

Using Eqs. (17) and (18) in Eq. (5), we immediately

get that the redshift function is

k(R, ε, δ) = εδ .

(22)

In these variables it depends on ε and δ and not on R.

Moreover, we immediately see that

M (R, ε, δ) = R(1 − εδ) ,

Q(R, ε, δ) = Rp(1 − ε2)(1 − δ2) .

Then we can study the three cases.

(23)

(24)

Case 1. For r+ 6= r− and as R → r+, i.e., for δ = O(1)
and as ε → 0, we get from Eqs. (23)-(22)

M (r+, ε, δ) = r+ , Q(r+, ε, δ) = r+ .

(25)

It is clearly seen from Eqs. (17) and (18) that the vari-
ables ε and δ are the good ones to take the extremal limit.
There are however diﬀerent extremal limits depending on
how ε and δ are taken to zero.

Case 2. For R → r+ and r+ → r−, i.e., for δ = ε
λ , with
λ kept ﬁxed according to Eq. (20), and ε → 0 we get
from Eqs. (23)-(22)

M (r+, ε, δ) = r+ , Q(r+, ε, δ) = r+ .

(26)

Case 3. For r+ = r− and as R → r+, i.e., for δ = ε and
ε → 0 it is seen from Eq. ( 28) that

M (r+, ε, δ) = r+ , Q(r+, ε, δ) = r+ .

(27)

Case 1. For r+ 6= r− and as R → r+, i.e., for δ = O(1)
and as ε → 0, we get from Eq. (32),
Φ(r+, ε, δ) = 0 .

(33)

4

The three limits here not surprisingly yield the same

result, the mass-charge-radius extremal condition.

VI. PRESSURE, ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND

TEMPERATURE: THE THREE EXTREMAL

HORIZON LIMITS

A. Pressure limits

In order for the non-extremal electric charged shell to
remain static, its surface pressure must have a speciﬁc
functional form, given by Eq. (10) in terms of the vari-
ables ε and δ deﬁned in Eqs. (17) and (18) can be readily
written as

p(R, ε, δ) =

1

16πR

(δ − ε)2

δε

.

(28)

Now, we will consider the behavior of pressure in all three
cases.

Case 1. For r+ 6= r− and as R → r+, i.e., for δ = O(1)
and as ε → 0, we get from Eq. (28)

p(r+, ε, δ) =

δ

16πr+ε ∼

1
ε

.

(29)

So, the pressure is divergent in this case as 1/ε.
Case 2. For R → r+ and r+ → r−, i.e., for δ = ε
λ , with
λ kept ﬁxed according to Eq. (20), and ε → 0 we get
from Eq. (28) Put back intermediate step
(1 − λ)2

p(r+, ε, δ) =

(30)

1

,

16πr+

λ

where λ = ε/δ as deﬁned in Eq. (20). Eq. (30) means
that the pressure will remain ﬁnite but nonzero in this
horizon limit for the extremal shell.

Case 3. For r+ = r− and as R → r+, i.e., for δ = ε and
ε → 0 it is seen from Eq. ( 28) that
p(r+, ε, δ) = 0 .

(31)

The result p = 0 holds in fact at any radius, including
the horizon limit.

B. Electric potential limits

The electric potential Φ of the shell must also assume
a speciﬁc form if the shell is to remain static. In terms
of ε and δ deﬁned in Eqs. (17) and (18), Eq. (13) gives

Φ(R, ε, δ) =r 1 − δ2
1 − ε2

ε
δ

.

(32)

It is now straightforward to analyze the three limiting
cases under discussion.

Case 2. For R → r+ and r+ → r−, i.e., for δ = ε
λ , with
λ kept ﬁxed according to Eq. (20), and ε → 0 we get,
Put back intermediate step from Eq. (32),

Φ(r+, ε, δ) = λ ,

(34)

with 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1.
Case 3. For r+ = r− and as R → r+, i.e., for δ = ε and
ε → 0 it would seem from Eq. (32) that Φ(r+, ε, δ) = 1.
However, this case is special since from the very begin-
ning we should proceed in a diﬀerent way, so the form
of the integrability condition (11) and Eq. (32) are no
longer valid here. As it is shown in [38], the calculations
for this case lead to the inequality

Φ(r+, ε, δ) ≤ 1 .

(35)

Thus, if we take an extremal shell from the very begin-
ning, the electric potential in general diﬀers from what
is obtained by the extremal limit from the nonextremal
state.

C. Temperature limits

Assuming that the shell has a well deﬁned tempera-
ture, the integrability conditions imposed from the ﬁrst
law of thermodynamics an in terms of ε and δ deﬁned in
Eqs. (17) and (18), Eq. (14) gives

TH(R, ε, δ) =

δ2 − ε2

4πR(1 − ε2)2 ,

and so the local temperature on the shell is thus

T (R, ε, δ) =

TH
k

=

δ2 − ε2

4πRδε(1 − ε2)2 .

(36)

(37)

Case 1. For r+ 6= r− and as R → r+, i.e., for δ = O(1)
and as ε → 0, we get from Eq. (37),
4πr+ε ∼

T (r+, ε, δ) =

(38)

1
ε

δ

.

So it diverges.
Case 2. For R → r+ and r+ → r−, i.e., for δ = ε
λ , with
λ kept ﬁxed according to Eq. (20), and ε → 0 we get
from Eq. (37), Put back intermediate step

T (r+, ε, δ) =

1 − λ2
4πr+λ

.

(39)

1−λ
1+λ .

It remains ﬁnite and nonzero.
It is worth noting a
simple formula that follows from (39) and relates the
pressure and temperature in this horizon limit, namely,
p
T = 1
Case 3. For r+ = r− and as R → r+, i.e., for δ = ε and
ε → 0, one can relax condition (15) in such a way that
T0 → 0 but T remains ﬁnite (see [38] fo details).

VII. ENTROPY: THE THREE EXTREMAL

HORIZON LIMITS

To obtain the distinct limits for the entropy, one can
express the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics Eq. (1) in terms
of the variables (R, r+, r−), using the Eqs. (6), (7),
(8), (10), (11), and (16)).
In turn using Eqs. (17),
(18), (22), (23), (24), (28), and (32), the ﬁrst law of
thermodynamics Eq. (1) can be expressed in terms of
the variables (R, ε, δ), in the quite general exact form
2δε +

T dS = a1dR + a2dε + a3dδ, where a1 = 1− δε + (δ−ε)2
(1− Rc), a2 = −δRh1 + 1−δ2
δ2 (1 − Rc)i, a3 =
−εRh1 + 1−ε2
ε2 (1 − Rc)i. Imposing further that the elec-
1−ε2(cid:17)i, a3 = 0. Then,

tric potential must also assume the value of Eq. (12),
enables to simplify the coeﬃcients a1, a2, and a3, into
a1 = δ2−ε2
using Eq. (37 ), the diﬀerential for the entropy in the
variables (R, ǫ, δ) becomes

(1−δ2)(1−ε2)

2δε , a2 = −δRh1 − ε2

δ2 (cid:16) 1−δ2

δǫ

dS(R, ǫ, δ) = 2π R(cid:0)1 − ε2(cid:1)2

dR − 4π R2ε(cid:0)1 − ε2(cid:1) dε .

(40)

This equation can be integrated to give

S(r+, ǫ, δ) = π R2(cid:0)1 − ε2(cid:1)2

,

(41)

where we have put the integration constant to zero. Us-
ing Eq. (17) it gives

S(r+) =

A+
4

(42)

where A+ is the gravitational radius area, or the horizon
area when the shell is push into the gravitational radius,
see Eq. (9).
It
is striking that all the other quantities, p, Φ, T , depend
generically on ε and δ. The entropy does not, it only
depends on r+.

It is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.

Case 1. For r+ 6= r− and as R → r+, i.e., for δ = O(1)
and as ε → 0, we get from Eq. (42), S(r+) = A+
4 . This is
general for any nonextremal black hole. We can now take
the extremal limit δ → 0 and obtain that the entropy of
an extremal charged black hole is by continuity S(r+) =
A+
4 , the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
Case 2. For R → r+ and r+ → r−, i.e., for δ = ε
λ , with
λ kept ﬁxed according to Eq. (20), and ε → 0 we obtain

5

from Eq. (42), S(r+) = A+
4 . So in the case that the shell
achieves the gravitational radius simultaneously with the
extremal limit one also gets the Bekenstein-Hawking en-
tropy.

Case 3. For r+ = r− and as R → r+, i.e., for δ = ε and
ε → 0, the entropy cannot be handled in this manner and
should be considered separately. This has been done in
[38] with the result that the entropy is not ﬁxed unam-
biguously for a given r+, it is any physical well behaved
function of r+, or if one prefers, of A+, i.e.,

S(r+) = a physical well behaved function of A+ .

(43)

Eqs. (40)-(42) work for cases 1 and 2. In case 3, the ab
initio extremal shell with δ = ε one is led to the discussion
given in [38].

VIII. DISCUSSION ON THE THREE

EXTREMAL HORIZON LIMITS: WHERE DOES

THE ENTROPY STEM FROM?

It is instructive to trace in more detail, how from the
ﬁrst law, the entropy arises. More precisely, we are in-
terested in the question: Which contributions dominate
for the three diﬀerent cases?

Case 1. For r+ 6= r− and as R → r+, i.e., for δ = O(1)
and as ε → 0, let us, for simplcity, do ε = constant ≪ 1.
Then, in the ﬁrst law Eq. (1), and from Eq. (29), we
can retain the term due to the pressure only, taking into
account Eq. (38), we obtain the result (42). Thus, the
pressure term gives the whole contribution to the entropy.
See also [11].

Case 2. For R → r+ and r+ → r−, i.e., for δ = ε
λ ,
with λ kept ﬁxed according to Eq. (20), and ε → 0,
all three terms in the ﬁrst law give contribution to the
entropy. Thus, the mass, pressure and electric potential
terms give contributions to the entropy.

Case 3. For r+ = r− and as R → r+, i.e., for δ = ε
and ε → 0, and according to Eq. (31), the ﬁrst and third
terms in Eq. (1) contribute to the entropy. Thus cases 1
and 3 are complementary to each other in what concerns
the origin of the entropy.

It is convenient to present the results in the following

It is worth stressing that the results presented in the
table refer in general not to black holes but to shells.

Only in the horizon limit these results apply to black
holes. Usually, if one considers the extremal limit of a

nonextremal black hole, it remains in the same topologi-
cal class during the limiting transition, so it is not surpris-
ing that in the extremal limit one obtains the Bekenstein-
Hawking value. However, in our case, we obtained some-
thing more: the fact that the exact value of the shell’s
entropy coincides with that of a black hole for a given
r+ independently of R. For an arbitrary self-gravitating
matter system this is not so, the entropy of the system is
a function of r+, R, and possibly other variables. Only
in the horizon limit the Bekenstein-Hawking value is re-
covered [11].

µ is some tensor ﬁnite on the horizon, g00 being
the 00 component of the metric in use. In the horizon
limit, the requirement of the ﬁniteness of T ν
µ entails T0 =
TH. For the nonextremal horizon one has TH 6= 0.

Now, in the extremal case, TH = 0, whence

T ν

µ =

T 4
0
(g00)2 f ν
µ .

(45)

Thus, the attempt to put T0 6= 0 according to the pre-
scriptions given in [16, 17], leads to inﬁnite stresses since
T 4
(g00)2 diverges as one approaches the horizon. This de-
0
stroys the horizon [39, 40].

However, when we deal with a shell instead of a black
hole, an intermediate case can be realized. Namely, si-
multaneously T0 → 0 and g00 → 0 in such a way that T

is kept bounded. This is realized in Case 2 according to
Eq. (39). It is also realized in Case 3.

X. CONCLUSIONS

We found what happens in calculating the entropy and
the other thermodynamic quantities when diﬀerent lim-
iting transitions for a shell are taken and how they are
related to each other when the radius of the shell ap-
proaches the horizon radius, i.e., it turns into a black
hole.

It happens that the limits in cases 1 and 2 agree in
what concerns the entropy but they disagree in the be-
havior of all other quantities. Cases 2 and 3 disagree in
what concerns the entropy but agree in the behavior of
the local temperature and electric potential. Case 2 is
intermediate between 1 and 3.

The results obtained showed how careful one should be
in the calculations when a system approaches the hori-
zon which, in turn, is close to the extremal state. It is of
interest to trace whether and how these subtleties can af-
fect calculations in quantum ﬁeld theory including string
theory.
