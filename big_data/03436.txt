Abstract

We present a simple and complete classiﬁcation of static solutions in the Einstein-
Maxwell system with a massless scalar ﬁeld in arbitrary n(≥ 3) dimensions. We
consider spacetimes which correspond to a warped product M 2 × K n−2, where
K n−2 is a (n − 2)-dimensional Einstein space. The scalar ﬁeld is assumed to
depend only on the radial coordinate and the electromagnetic ﬁeld is purely
electric. The general solution with a non-constant real scalar ﬁeld consists of
seven solutions for n ≥ 4 and three solutions for n = 3. None of them is
endowed of a Killing horizon in accordance with the no-hair theorem.

Introduction

The role of exact solutions in physics is to understand the properties of physical phenomena
in a variety of situations. Even a particular solution may play a large role for our under-
standing of nature.
In gravitational physics, good examples of such exact solutions are
Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions. By the black hole uniqueness theorem, asymptotically
ﬂat static black holes in vacuum are represented by Schwarzschild solution [1] and this re-
sult has been extended to the stationary case in which Kerr solution represents the unique
black hole [2]. This implies that, in the asymptotically ﬂat and stationary spacetime in
vacuum, all the properties of a black hole are encoded in the Kerr black hole and it lead
us to the discovery of the black-hole mechanics [3] and then its celebrated thermodynamics
description [4].

However, this strong uniqueness result does not mean that the ﬁnal state of gravitational
collapse is always a Kerr black hole because there might be other solutions which do not
represent a black hole but a star or naked singularity. In this context, the cosmic censorship
hypothesis has been proposed, which asserts that the ﬁnal state in physically reasonable
and generic situations cannot be a naked singularity [5, 6]. Although the generic proof
of this hypothesis is far from complete, it has been studied in the systems with symmetry
which makes the problem tractable. Among others, in the spherically symmetric spacetime,
the cosmic censorship hypothesis was shown to be false, where a naked singularity is formed
in the dynamical region with matter [7]. On the other hand, it was shown to be true in the
case with a massless scalar ﬁeld [8].

These results suggest that the ﬁnal static conﬁguration after the collapse may be not a
Schwarzschild black hole but a naked singularity and motivate us to classify all the spheri-
cally symmetric and static solutions to ﬁnd the candidates of the ﬁnal conﬁguration. It was
shown [9] that the general spherically symmetric and static solution for a massless scalar
ﬁeld is the Janis-Newman-Winicour solution [10] which contains one additional parameter
to the mass parameter in the Schwarzschild solution.

This classiﬁcation problem can be naturally extended in the presence of the Maxwell ﬁeld
in addition. The unique static black hole in this system is the Reissner-Nordstr¨om black
hole [11] and the exterior of this charged black hole is stable against linear perturbations [12]
similar to the Schwarzschild black hole [13]. However, it suﬀers from diﬀerent kinds of
instability. One is the so-called mass inﬂation instability of the inner horizon [14] which
transform a part of the inner horizon into a curvature singularity in gravitational collapse of
a massless scalar ﬁeld with the Maxwell ﬁeld [15]. It was also found that extreme Reissner-
Nordstr¨om black hole suﬀers from a diﬀerent type of instability at the extremal horizon
where the second derivative of a massless scalar ﬁeld generically grows with time [16] (see
also [17]).

2

These instability motivates us to classify all the spherically symmetric and static solu-
tions with a massless scalar ﬁeld and purely electric Maxwell ﬁeld, however, it is not an
easy task. For example, while the Janis-Newman-Winicour solution can be obtained by
a certain solution-generating method from the Schwarzschild solution [18], such a method
has not been found yet in the presence of the Maxwell ﬁeld. Actually in [19], all the
asymptotically ﬂat and static solutions have been classiﬁed in four dimensions, however,
the metric functions and the scalar ﬁeld are given in terms of the electric potential. In the
present paper, we present all static solutions in a closed form in a more general setup and
in arbitrary dimensions.

In the next section we introduce the action and the corresponding ﬁeld equations. From
the general expressions for a static metric and for a radial scalar and electric ﬁeld, it is
shown the absence of a Killing horizon in presence a non-constant scalar ﬁeld, in agreement
with the no-hair theorem.
In Sec. 3, the ﬁeld equations are solved for four and higher
dimensions and the complete set of the solutions is expressed in a very simple closed form.
The three-dimensional case is also solved in Sec. 4. After some concluding remarks, an
appendix is included. The appendix contains a simple derivation of the full set of solutions,
which is obtained by using an alternative radial coordinate.

Our basic notations follow [20]. The conventions of curvature tensors are [∇ρ,∇σ]V µ =
νρσV ν and Rµν = Rρ
Rµ
µρν. The Minkowski metric is taken to be the mostly plus sign, and
Roman indices run over all spacetime indices. The n-dimensional gravitational constant is
denoted by κ, and the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength is given by Fµν := ∇µAν − ∇νAµ.

2 Preliminaries

2.1 System

We consider the Einstein-Maxwell system in n(≥ 3) spacetime dimensions with a massless
scalar ﬁeld, which is deﬁned by the action

(2.3)

(2.4)

In the present paper, we consider static spacetimes which correspond to a warped prod-
uct M 2 × K n−2, where K n−2 is a (n − 2)-dimensional Einstein space. A general metric in
such a spacetime can be written as

ds2 =gtt(x)dt2 + gxx(x)dx2 + R(x)2γij(z)dzidzj.

(2.5)
Here γij(z) is the metric on the (n−2)-dimensional Einstein space K n−2, whose Ricci tensor
is given by (n−2)Rij = k(n − 3)γij, where k = 1, 0,−1. In addition, we assume φ = φ(x)
and Aµdxµ = At(x)dt. Then, the Maxwell equation and the Klein-Gordon equation (2.2)
are integrated to give

Fxt = q(cid:18)−

(2.6)

where q and φ1 are integration constants. We assume that φ1 is real and non-zero, namely
we are considering a non-constant real scalar ﬁeld throughout this paper.

2.2 Absence of a Killing horizon

In the spacetime (2.5), gtt(x) = 0 corresponds to a Killing horizon if it is regular and not
inﬁnity. However, it is shown that there is no Killing horizon in the present system unless
φ1 = 0.

Here we adopt the following coordinates:

ds2 = − f (x)e−2δ(x)dt2 + f (x)−1dx2 + R(x)2γij(z)dzidzj.

If R is constant, the Einstein equations give

0 = Et

t − Ex

x = −

φ2
1e2δ

f R2(n−2)

(2.7)

(2.8)

from which φ1 = 0 is concluded. Since we consider the case with φ1 6= 0, R is not constant
and then we can choose coordinates such that R(x) = x without loss of generality. Then,
the trace of the Einstein equations gives

(n − 2)R = κ(cid:26)−

(n − 4)q2
x2(n−2) +

1e2δ

(n − 2)φ2

(2.9)

f (xh) = 0 with |δ(xh)| < ∞ deﬁnes a Killing horizon if x = xh(> 0) is not inﬁnity.
Equation (2.9) shows that limx→xh R → ∞ unless φ1 = 0. Therefore, it is concluded
that there is no Killing horizon (and then no event horizon exists), in the presence of a
non-constant scalar ﬁeld.

3 General solution in four and higher dimensions

In this section, we present all the static solutions in the present system in four and higher
dimensions. We perform the complete classiﬁcation in the following coordinates:

ds2 = − F (x)−2dt2 + F (x)2/(n−3)G(x)−(n−4)/(n−3)(cid:18)dx2 + G(x)γij(z)dzidzj(cid:19),

We are now ready to perform the classiﬁcation. G(x) and F (x) are obtained from

Eqs. (3.3) and (3.6), respectively, and Eq. (3.4) is a constraint on them.

In order to ﬁnd the location of the (naked) curvature singularities in this coordinate

system, we use the trace of the Einstein equations:

(3.7)

The above expression shows that the real zeros of F 2G = 0 correspond to curvature singu-
larities. Note that where the numerator of Eq. (3.7) vanishes, F has a ﬁnite value. Then,
the denominator of (3.7) can be zero at that point only if G vanishes there. However,
for all our solutions in which G can be zero at some point, the function F diverges there.
Therefore, the numerator and denominator in (3.7) do not vanish simultaneously. Conse-
quently, in all the solutions presented in this paper, there appear two classes of curvature
singularities: One is given by G = 0 with inﬁnite F satisfying F 2G = 0 and the other is
given by F = 0 with ﬁnite G. At the singularity in the ﬁrst class, the scalar ﬁeld diverges,
while it remains ﬁnite at the singularity in the second class.

3.1 General solution for k = 1, −1 when G(x) has real roots

First we consider the case of k = 1,−1 where G(x) has real roots. In this case, Eq. (3.3) is
integrated to give

(3.8)
where a, b are constants. We can assume a ≥ b > 0 without loss of generality. Then the
scalar ﬁeld is given by

G(x) = k(n − 3)2(x − a)(x − b),

φ(x) = φ0 +

φ1

k(n − 3)2(a − b)

(3.9)

(3.10)

for a 6= b and

for a = b. The scalar ﬁeld diverges only at x = a and x = b. We have put ε = ±1 in order
to make inside the bracket being positive depending on the domain of x.

The general solution for Eq. (3.6) with the constraint (3.4) in the case of a 6= b and
1 6= (n − 2)(n − 3)3(a − b)2/4κ (corresponding to α 6= 0) is

where constants α, A, and B satisfy

(3.13)

φ2

1 =

κq2

4κ

This is the generalization in arbitrary dimensions of the Penney solution (n = 4 and k = 1)
found in [21]. For this solution, we compute

F 2G =k(n − 3)2(cid:26)A

(x − a)(α+1)/2
(x − b)(α−1)/2 + B

(x − b)−(α+1)/2(cid:27)2
(x − a)−(α−1)/2

,

(3.14)

where we have set ε = 1 for simplicity. Since reality of the scalar ﬁeld requires −1 < α < 1
by Eq. (3.13), F 2G = 0 holds at both x = a and x = b and hence they are curvature
singularities. A solution of F (x) = 0 for AB < 0 necessarily satisﬁes x 6= a, b and it
corresponds to a curvature singularity with ﬁnite φ.

In the case of a 6= b and φ2

1 = (n − 2)(n − 3)3(a − b)2/4κ, the general solution is
F (x) = A ln(cid:18)ε

x − b(cid:19)+B,
x − a

where

κq2

A2 =

(n − 2)(n − 3)3(a − b)2 .

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

In this solution, both x = a and x = b correspond to curvature singularities because the
following expression

F 2G =k(n − 3)2(x − a)(x − b)(cid:26)A ln(cid:18)ε

x − b(cid:19)+B(cid:27)2
x − a

shows that F 2G = 0 holds there. A solution of F (x) = 0 for A 6= 0 satisﬁes x 6= a, b and it
corresponds to a curvature singularity with ﬁnite φ.

Lastly, in the case of a = b, the general solution is

(3.18)

(3.19)

where

Since the metric function F is ﬁnite in this solution, the zero of G, x = a, corresponds to a
curvature singularity. Moreover, in this special case, there is an inﬁnite number of solutions
for F (x) = 0, which are all diﬀerent from x = a and represent curvature singularities with
ﬁnite φ.

3.2 General solution for k = 1, −1 when G(x) has no real root

Next we consider the case of k = 1,−1 where G(x) has no real root. In this case, Eq. (3.3)
is integrated to give

G(x) = k(n − 3)2x2 + G0,

(3.20)

where G0 is a constant satisfying kG0 > 0 and we have used the degree of freedom to
change the origin of x. Then the scalar ﬁeld is given by

φ(x) = φ0 +

φ1

(n − 3)√kG0

arctan(cid:18)(n − 3)kx
√kG0 (cid:19).

Remarkably, the scalar ﬁeld is ﬁnite everywhere in this class of solutions.

The general solution for Eq. (3.6) with the constraint (3.4) is given by

F (x) =A sin(cid:26)s κφ2
+B cos(cid:26)sκφ2

1 + (n − 2)(n − 3)kG0

whee constants A and B satisfy

A2 + B2 =

κq2

(n − 2)(n − 3)kG0 + κφ2

.

(3.23)

In this case, there is a ﬁnite number of solutions for F (x) = 0, which all correspond to
curvature singularities. For example, the solution for F (x) = 0 with A 6= 0 is given in the
following form:

arctan

(n − 3)kx
√kG0

=s (n − 2)(n − 3)kG0

1 + (n − 2)(n − 3)kG0(cid:18)πN − arctan

(3.24)

where N is an integer. Since the absolute value of the left-hand side is less than π/2, this
algebraic equation has solutions only for some values of N depending on the integration
constants.

3.3 General solution for k = 0

In the case of k = 0, Eq. (3.3) is integrated to give

G(x) = G1x + G0,

(3.25)

8

where G0 and G1 are constants. Then the scalar ﬁeld is given by

φ(x) = φ0 +

1 6= (n − 2)G2
φ2

1/4(n − 3)κ is given by

where constants α, A, and B satisfy

,

(3.28)

(3.29)

(3.30)

(3.31)

where we have set ε = 1 for simplicity. Since reality of the scalar ﬁeld requires −1 < α < 1
by Eq. (3.29), F 2G = 0 holds at G = 0, namely x = −G0/G1. Hence it corresponds to a
curvature singularity. Also, a solution of F (x) = 0 for AB < 0 corresponds to a curvature
singularity but with ﬁnite φ.

The general solution for Eq. (3.6) in the case of G1 6= 0 and φ2

1 = (n − 2)G2

1/4(n − 3)κ

is given by

where

F (x) =A ln(cid:26)ε(G1x + G0)(cid:27)+B,

A2 =

(n − 3)κq2
(n − 2)G2

.

(3.32)

(3.33)

Also in this case, G(x) = 0 corresponds to a curvature singularity since F 2G = 0 holds
there. In addition, a solution of F (x) = 0 for A 6= 0 corresponds to a curvature singularity
with ﬁnite φ.

Lastly, the general solution in the case of G1 = 0 is given by

F (x) =A sin(cid:18)r (n − 3)κ

where

(3.34)

(3.35)

Since F is ﬁnite everywhere, G(x) = 0 corresponds to a curvature singularity. Additionally,
in this special case, there is an inﬁnite number of zeros of F (x) = 0 which are all curvature
singularities with ﬁnite φ.

4 General solution in three dimensions

In this section, we present the classiﬁcation in three dimensions. We will use the Einstein
equations in the form of E µ

ν = 0, where

Eµν := Rµν − κ(cid:26)FµρF ρ
ν −

1

2(n − 2)

gµνFρσF ρσ(cid:27)−κ(∇µφ)(∇νφ).

(4.1)

Clearly the gauge (3.1) does not work for n = 3. For the three-dimensional case, we adopt
the following coordinates:

ds2 = −e−2Φ(r)dt2 + e2Ψ(r)(dr2 + e2Φ(r)dθ2).

In this coordinate system, the scalar ﬁeld is integrated to give

φ(r) = φ0 + φ1r,

where φ0 and φ1 are constants. Moreover, the ﬁeld strength is given by

Frt = qe−2Φ(r),

where q is an integration constant.

Now the Einstein equations are written as

The general solution of Eq. (4.5) is given by

e−2Φ = c2

0e−2Φ1r,

(4.8)

where c0 and Φ1 are constants. The classiﬁcation is rather simple: We solve Eq. (4.7) for
Ψ(r) and use Eq. (4.6) as a constraint.

5 Concluding remarks

In the present paper, we have presented a complete classiﬁcation of static solutions in
the Einstein-Maxwell system with a non-constant massless scalar ﬁeld in arbitrary n(≥ 3)
dimensions. We have considered a warped product spacetimes M 2 × K n−2, where K n−2 is
a (n− 2)-dimensional Einstein space and assumed that the scalar ﬁeld depends only on the
radial coordinate and the electromagnetic ﬁeld is purely electric.

The general solution consists of seven solutions for n ≥ 4 and three solutions for n = 3,
which are all written by elementary functions and summarized in Table 1. None of them
is endowed of a Killing horizon in accordance with the no-hair theorem. The solutions in
four and higher dimensions are also obtained in a diﬀerent but useful coordinate system,
which are presented in Appendix A.

Along the text we have considered a real scalar ﬁeld. However, one can consider also a
phantom scalar ﬁeld. This case follows from our solutions by including the condition φ2
1 < 0.
In such a case with a phantom scalar ﬁeld, a complete classiﬁcation requires an additional

This corresponds to an arbitrary dimensional generalization of the Ellis wormhole [23] with
a Maxwell ﬁeld. This solution with n = 4 and k = 1 was given in [22].

One of the possible generalization of the present work is to add a cosmological constant.
Even without the Maxwell ﬁeld, a complete classiﬁcation of the static solutions has not
been performed yet. Only the general solution for the case of Ricci ﬂat base manifolds
(k = 0), and in presence of a negative cosmological constant, is known in any spacetime
dimension [24]. Another possible generalization is to consider the dilatonic coupling of the
scalar ﬁeld to the Maxwell ﬁeld. We will address these problems elsewhere.

A Other useful gauge in four and higher dimensions

A.1 Basic equations

In four and higher dimensions we consider a new radial coordinate r, such as dx = Gdr.
In this gauge the metric (3.1) reads now

ds2 = − F (r)−2dt2 + F (r)2/(n−3)G(r)1/(n−3)(cid:18)G(r)dr2 + γij(z)dzidzj(cid:19),

so that the ﬁeld equations (2.2) yield

Frt =

q
F 2 ,

dφ
dr

= c,

where c and q are constants.

Now, we write the Einstein equations as

E µ
ν ≡ Rµ

ν − κ(cid:18)T µ
ν −

ν(cid:19) = 0,

where the energy-momentum tensor is Tµν = T (φ)

and T is its trace.

Using the gauge (A.1), and deﬁning (for n ≥ 4)

F = e−b

we obtain

Remarkably, this system in arbitrary dimensions n ≥ 4 exactly takes the same form as in
four dimensions.

A ﬁrst integral of Eq. (A.9) can be obtained by setting b′′ = b′db′/db. Thus, we have

b′2 =

κq2

ne2b + b1,

(A.12)

where b1 is an integration constant. From (A.9) and (A.12) we note that b′2 − b′′ = b1,
which reduces (A.10) to h′′ − a1h = 0 with a1 = κc2

n/2 + b1.

In summary, the system to be solved is takes a very simple form:

if b1 = 0,

if b1 > 0,

if b1 < 0,

if qn = 0.

The solution of (A.14) depends on the sign of a1. Thus, the following cases appear:

15

A.2.1

a1 > 0

This occurs if b1 > −κc2

n/2. In this case (A.14) gives

h = c1e√a1r + c2e−√a1r,

where the integration constants c1, c2 are constrained by (A.15) to hold

4a1c1c2 + γn = 0.

(A.17)

(A.18)

Note that if k = 0, and hence γn = 0, one of the constants c1, c2 must be 0.

A.2.2

a1 = 0

This is the case when b1 = −κc2

n/2. Here, the general solution of (A.14) is

h = c1r + c2.

(A.19)

Now, from (A.15) we note that the integration constant c1 must satisfy c2
1 = γn. Then,
this case is not possible for k = −1. There are no restriction on c2 except if k = 0. In this
situation c2 must be positive.

A.2.3

a1 < 0

The constant a1 is negative if b1 < −κc2

n/2. The solution of (A.14) for a1 < 0 is

h = c1 sin(√−a1r) + c2 cos(√−a1r),

where the integration constants c1, c2 are required, from (A.15), to verify

a1(c2

1 + c2

2) + γn = 0.

(A.20)

(A.21)

Since a1 < 0, the last equation implies that this case is only compatible with a transverse
section chosen as a (n − 2)-dimensional Einstein space having a positive k.

In summary, we have determined all the possible solutions associated to the line element
(A.1), where F is given in (A.16), and G = h−2. The electric ﬁeld is Frt = q/F 2 and the
scalar ﬁeld φ = c r + φ0, with φ0 an integration constant.
