Group-IV monochalcogenides are a family of two-dimensional puckered materials with an or-
thorhombic structure that is comprised of polar layers. In this letter, we use ﬁrst principles calcula-
tions to explore the multistability of monolayer SnS and GeSe, two prototype materials where the
direction of the puckering can be switched by application of stress or electric ﬁeld. Our ﬁndings
suggest the potential application of SnS and GeSe monolayers for two-dimensional phase-change
memory and ferroelectric memory devices.

The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) graphene has
led to the intense interest in other 2D materials with
novel properties that can be isolated into single layers
through exfoliation [1, 2]. In particular, transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been studied extensively,
and have been shown to have many technological ap-
plications ranging from photovoltaics to valleytronic de-
vices [3–9]. The family of monolayer 2D materials has
recently grown to include other 2D semiconductors, such
as phosphorene and related materials.

However, one of the features thus far lacking for ap-
plications both in 2D electronics and in valleytronics is
non-volatile memory. Ferromagnetism, an essential ele-
ment in spintronic memories, is believed to be achievable
in graphene and other 2D materials, but so far remains
diﬃcult to realize and control [10]. Ferroelectric memo-
ries, in which the information is stored in the orientation
of the electric dipole rather than in the magnetization
are a possible option. Single-layer graphene (SLG) ferro-
electric ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors (FFET) with symmetrical
bit writing have been demonstrated [11], but the proto-
types rely on bulk or thin ﬁlm ferroelectric substrates [11]
or ferroelectric polymers [12], rather than on crystalline
atomically thin ferroelectric materials. An altogether dif-
ferent approach to information storage relies on phase
change materials, where the bit value corresponds to a
distinct structural phase of the material. Researchers
have recently optimized the phase switching energy by
using superlattice structures where the movement of the
atoms is conﬁned to only one dimension [13].

In this letter, we propose an atomically thin medium
for information storage, based on the group-IV layered
monochalcogenides MX (M=Ge or Sn, and X=S or Se).
As prototypes, we use SnS and GeSe. In ambient condi-
tions, bulk SnS and GeSe crystallize in the orthorhombic
structure of the P nma space group. At 878 K, SnS goes
through a second order displacive phase transition into
the β-SnS phase with Cmcm symmetry [14, 15], which
is also a layered phase that can be viewed as a distorted

rocksalt structure. For bulk GeSe, such a phase transi-
tion has not been observed. Instead, at 924 K bulk GeSe
transforms into the rocksalt phase (F m¯3m). This phase
can also be stabilized using external pressure [16].

Similar to phosphorene [17, 18], P nma SnS and GeSe
can be exfoliated [19, 20]. In monolayer form, they fea-
ture multiple valleys, large spin-orbit splitting[21] and
a piezoelectric coeﬃcient that surpasses that of the
TMDs [22, 23]. Having an in-plane polar axis makes SnS
and GeSe monolayers capable of a mechanical response
to an applied electric ﬁeld.

Here, we use ﬁrst-principles calculations to show how
the multistability of SnS and GeSe can be exploited for
memory applications. We start by demonstrating how
the reversible phase transition can be induced by uniaxial
stress or electric ﬁeld. Then, we show how the phase and
lattice orientation states can be detected using the valley
properties.

The calculations were based on density functional the-
ory (DFT) implemented in the Quantum ESPRESSO
package [24]. The generalized gradient approximation
(GGA) of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) was used for
the exchange and correlation functional, and Troullier-
Martins type pseudopotentials [25]. The Kohn-Sham or-
bitals were expanded in a plane-wave basis with a cutoﬀ
energy of 70 Ry, and for the charge density a cutoﬀ of
280 Ry was used. A k-point grid sampling grid was gen-
erated using the Monkhorst-Pack scheme with 10×10×1
points [26], and a ﬁner regular grid of 80×80×1 was used
for transition probability calculations.

We start by exploring the phase diagrams of mono-
layer SnS and GeSe. A fundamental diﬀerence between
SnS and GeSe is the existence, for SnS, of a centrosym-
metric structure (Cmcm), close in energy to the ground
state P nma, which has not been found to be stable for
GeSe (Fig. 1). We will designate the respective mono-
layer phases by appending ‘ML’ to the respective bulk
space group.

FIG. 3. Structural visualization of clamped SnS monolayer
under uniform electric ﬁeld at points of transition. Puckering
orientation can switch from positive ˆx (b) to either negative
ˆx (a) or positive ˆy (c) depending on the directions of applied
electric ﬁeld.

outlined in Ref. [23].

For uniaxial stress along ˆy, the SnS structure begins
to resemble Cmcm-ML as the shorter lattice parameter
b is stretched. For y > 0.08 , uniaxial stress results in
the rotation of the P nma-ML structure by π/2. The
puckering thus rotates from ˆx to ˆy [Fig. 2(a), transition
I].

Application of uniaxial stress along ˆx reveals another
phase transition at x = 0.72, when a hexagonal phase
resembling blue phosphorene appears [28] Fig. 6 (d)) [29].
Similar qualitative behavior is observed in GeSe (see
Fig. 2(b)). However, unlike SnS, once the stress is re-
moved the Cmcm structure spontaneously reverts back
to P nma. For GeSe, the phase transition to a hexagonal
structure occurs at x = 0.78.

Application of an electric ﬁeld is an alternative way to
trigger the transition between diﬀerent minima on the
energy surface of SnS or GeSe. Since the P nma-ML
structure is piezoelectric, the application of an electric
ﬁeld along the polar (ˆx) direction in a mechanically free
sample induces strain as well [23]. However, here we will
consider, for simplicity, the application of an electric ﬁeld
to a mechanically clamped sample. In this case, appli-
cation of an electric ﬁeld with polarity opposed to the
bond dipole results in bonds breaking and creates new
ones with inversion of the polarization along ˆx, rather
than in a rotation of the structure. The coercive ﬁeld for
this transformation is 0.18 V/nm for SnS and 0.51 V/nm
for GeSe. Moreover, we found that applying electric ﬁeld
in ˆy at 0.29 V/nm (0.80 V/nm) could also convert the
puckering orientation from ˆx to ˆy for SnS (GeSe). The
structures of SnS monolayer under electric ﬁelds at which
the puckering orientation switches are plotted in Fig. 3.
Since the two materials possess a spontaneous, re-
versible polarization and bistability, they classify as ferro-
electrics. However, this assumes that the high-symmetry
Cmcm-ML phase becomes more favorable with temper-
ature, as normally expected. Under this assumption,
the conﬁguration-coordinate diagram of GeSe is typical

are ±(x, 1/4, z; x ∓ δ, 1/4, z) in fractional coordinates,
whereas in the Cmcm-ML phase δ = 0. Thus, the
Cmcm-ML has an additional symmetry plane perpendic-
ular to ˆx, the polar (armchair) direction of the P nma-
ML. The P nma-ML and the Cmcm-ML phases can both
be seen as distortions of a rocksalt bilayer that can be
transformed into each other by a displacement of some
of the atoms along ˆx. For SnS, Cmcm-ML is a local
minima of the energy surface, and there are four distinct
P nma-ML conﬁgurations (equivalent by π/4 rotations)
into which the system can transform. These Cmcm and
P nma phases of SnS monolayer have also been reported
by Ref. [27]. For GeSe, the Cmcm-ML structure is not
an energy minimum but a saddle point. The activation
energy for reconﬁguration is very small (< 100 meV for
all transformations).

The phase transition of SnS to Cmcm-ML, or equiva-
lently the reorientation of the P nma-ML structure, can
be induced by in-plane uniaxial stress (Fig. 2). We use
an eﬀective thickness to estimate the values of stress, as

using the optical selection rules. The direct transitions
at the Vx and Vy valleys have diﬀerent energies, provided
there is a means to identify the orientation of the crystal
(Fig. 5). We plot the energy diﬀerence between valence
and conduction band of SnS as functions of in plane wave
vectors shown in Fig. 5 (a) and (b). It can be seen that
the gap surface of x = 0.22 (Fig. 5 (a)) is equivalent to
y = 0.27 (Fig. 5 (b)) but rotated 90◦. It is evident that
under uniaxial stress in ˆy the bands have rotated in the
Brillouin Zone, i.e. the Vy valley eﬀectively becomes the
Vx valley after passing the transition point of y=0.08.

Using linearly polarized light to select the valleys Vx
or Vy provides an additional method to detect the phase
transition optically. The interband transition probability
at a given wave vector k is given by [31]

where i is the direction of the light polarization, c(k) is

dipole moment between the initial and the ﬁnal bands:
(cid:104)c|ˆpx/y|v(cid:105), where the momentum direction corresponds
to the light polarization. For the transition to be al-
lowed, the dipole moment must not vanish. It is possible
to determine whether it is ﬁnite or not using the symme-

inversion is found at y = 0.08 and y = 0.15 for SnS and
GeSe, respectively. It is apparent that the band structure of

of a ferroelectric with second-order phase transition at
T = 0 (consistent with the change in symmetry). The
energy curve for SnS has a minimum rather than a saddle
point at Cmcm-ML, and therefore resembles a ferroelec-
tric with ﬁrst order phase transition, with the peculiarity
that the Cmcm-ML structure is stable for all T > 0.

The phase transitions are accompanied by changes of
the bandstructure and can, therefore, be detected op-
tically. Representative SnS and GeSe band structures
under uniaxial stress are shown in Fig. 6. Unstrained
SnS is an indirect-gap semiconductor with its valence
band maximum located near the X-point (along the Γ-X
line) and the conduction band minimum near the Y-point
(along the Γ-Y line). There are, therefore, two two-fold
degenerate valleys, designated Vx and Vy, respectively.
For uniaxial stress along ˆy there is a transition from in-
direct gap to direct gap at y = 0.02 (see Fig. 6(c)), af-
ter which the system again becomes indirect gap. Even
though unstrained GeSe is a direct-gap semiconductor,
there are also two nearly degenerate conduction band
minima at the Vx and Vy points. The swapping between
the ˆx and ˆy of the P nma-ML structure under tensile
stress along the ˆy direction is in this case accompanied
by a loss of the direct bandgap, which becomes indirect
as the structure reverts back into P nma-ML.[30]

The selection of valleys Vx or Vy can be achieved by at
least two diﬀerent optical methods, (i) using the fact that
the direct gap is diﬀerent at the two valley pairs or (ii)

Since the dipole
moment is computed by integrating the product of the
initial and ﬁnal wave functions, and the momentum, it
is nonzero only if this product (∝ c†(r)∂x/yv(r)) is not
odd with respect to any of the axes. In other words, the
integrand must remain unchanged under every symme-
try transformation of the space group characterizing the
crystal.

We used our ab initio results to calculate the transi-
tion probabilities. For unstrained SnS, ˆy-polarized light
populates only the Vy valleys, as there is no coupling
between the valence and conduction band at Vx in the
ˆy direction (see Fig. 5 (e)). As shown by Ref.
[31],
the conduction band, valence band, and the px have a
same irreducible representation. Consequently, the di-
rect product of these quantities results in a non-vanishing
transition probability coupling. On the other hand, ˆy-
polarized light cannot excite Vx as it possesses diﬀer-
ent representation. ˆx-polarized light can populate both
Vx and Vy but it populates predominantly the Vx val-
leys, with Px(Vx)/Px(Vy) ∼ 40. Similar behavior is ob-
served in GeSe with a smaller selective valley polariza-
tion ratio. For instance, with linearly ˆx-polarized light
the selective valley polarization ratio was found to be
Px(Vx)/Px(Vy) ∼ 15. The schematic valley polarization
is shown in Fig. 5 (c).

The evolution of local gap Vx and Vy of SnS under
stress in the ˆy direction is shown in Fig. 5(d). We see
that there is an abrupt change in Vy gap near the tran-
sition point y = 0.08. We also plot the relative polar-
ization Py(Vx)/Px(Vx) and Px(Vy)/Py(Vy) as a function
of axial strain y, shown in Fig. 5(e) and (f) for SnS and
GeSe, respectively. As we discussed earlier, ˆx-polarized
light populates predominantly the Vx valleys but there is
still a small transition probability at Vy when ˆx-polarized
light is used. The absorption threshold for ˆx-polarized
light has an abrupt change near y = 0.08 (y = 0.15
for GeSe), when the phase transition takes place. How-
ever, the absorption edge for ˆy-polarized light changes
smoothly.

Before the transition point, the Vy valleys can be pop-
ulated both ˆy and ˆx (with a small coupling) polarized
light where there is a reﬂection symmetry in ˆy of the
structure. However, after the transition point, the puck-
ering direction is rotated to be in the ˆy, and the reﬂection
symmetry in ˆy is broken, whereas a reﬂection symmetry
emerges in ˆx. As a result, Vx can be excited by both ˆx
and ˆy polarized light after the transition takes place. We
have therefore demonstrated how optical transitions can
be used to detect the orientation of the structure which
determine valley conﬁgurations.

In sum, we have used ﬁrst-principles calculations to
demonstrate the potential of group-IV monochalcogenide
monolayers as functional materials for information stor-
age. This strategy, demonstrated using SnS and GeSe
as prototypes, relies on the metastability and the possi-

4

bility of switching the polarization direction using stress
or electric ﬁeld, creating a binary memory device. Com-
paring these prototype materials, SnS diﬀers from GeSe
because it has a stable centrosymmetric phase which, at
T = 0, is close in energy to the P nma-ML phase.

Due to their peculiar bandstructure, both SnS and
GeSe can be used as functional materials for memory
devices that can easily be interfaced with valleytronics
logic. Valleytronics is based on the concept that the val-
ley index can be used to store information for subsequent
logic operations, equivalent to spin in spintronics. How-
ever, in most valleytronics materials the information can
be considered non-volatile only up to the timescale de-
ﬁned by inter-valley scattering processes, which are ubiq-
uitous in real materials. Structural changes, used to store
information in phase change memory devices, take place
in a timescale orders of magnitude longer. Materials such
as SnS and GeSe can be used to convert information
stored as structural phase into information stored as val-
ley index. One possibility is for example by using near-
bandgap light that excites only the pair of valleys corre-
sponding to the lowest energy exciton. The subsequent
electronic state will have electron-hole pairs with momen-
tum (±kx, 0) or (0,±ky), depending on the structure ori-
entation. This valley state can be transmitted onto a
valley-ﬁlter [32]. Alternatively, if coupled to a polarized
light detector, the polarization switching can be detected
optically taking advantage of valley-dependent direction
of the linear polarization of the luminescence [31].

FIG. 6. Representative band structures of SnS monolayers (a) unstrained, (b) to (d) under uniaxial stress along the ˆx for axial
strains of x = 0.22 to x = 0.75, and (e) to (g) under uniaxial stress along ˆy for axial strains of y = 0.02 to y = 0.27. The
dotted lines locate the valence band maximas. The corresponding side and top view of structural visualizations are below the
band structure plots. It is apparent that the band structure (b) x = 0.22 (or an uniaxial stress of σxx ∼ 1.4GPa) is equivalent
to the band structure (g) y = 0.27 (or an uniaxial stress of σyy ∼ 1.4GPa) if the ˆx and ˆy are inverted (rotation around Γ axis
on ﬁgures).

Supplemental Materials

In this supplemental section, we provide complete band structures of SnS and GeSe particularly for large strains
which are not plotted and discussed in the main text. The phase transitions are accompanied by changes of the
bandstructure and can, therefore, be detected optically. Representative SnS band structures under uniaxial stress
are shown in Fig. 6. Unstrained SnS is an indirect-gap semiconductor with its valence band maximum located near
the X-point (along the Γ-X line) and the conduction band minimum near the Y-point (along the Γ-Y line). There
are, therefore, two two-fold degenerate valleys, designated Vx and Vy, respectively. At large strains along ˆx, SnS
transforms to a hexagonal phase at x = 0.72 resembling blue phosphorene (Fig. 6 (c)) [29] and becomes a direct gap
at x = 0.75.

For uniaxial stress along ˆy there is a transition from indirect gap to direct gap at y = 0.02 (see Fig. 6(e)), after
which the system again becomes indirect gap. At y = 0.08, the structure transforms to the Cmcm-ML phase. After
this transition point, the puckering structure reorients from the ˆx to ˆy. It is apparent that the band structure (b)
x = 0.22 is equivalent to the band structure (g) y = 0.27 (or an uniaxial stress of if the ˆx and ˆy are inverted (rotation
around Γ axis on ﬁgures).

The band structure of GeSe under uniaxial stress is plotted in Fig. 7 (a) to (d) for the ˆx and (e) to (h) for the ˆy.
Unstrained GeSe is a direct-gap semiconductor with two nearly degenerate conduction band minima at the Vx and
Vy points. The transition to a hexagonal phase under tensile stress along ˆx (x = 0.78) is also accompanied by an
indirect- to direct-gap semiconductor transition.

For GeSe, unlike SnS (see Fig. 7 (e) to (h)), the swapping between the ˆx and ˆy of the P nma-ML structure under
tensile stress along the ˆy direction is in this case accompanied by a loss of the direct bandgap, which becomes indirect
as the structure reverts back into P nma-ML. The recovery of the P nma-ML structure at higher strains, however, is
not accompanied by a recovery of the direct gap, as long as the system remains strained in the ˆy. For GeSe, the phase
transition to Cmcm-ML phase occurs at y = 0.15 which is followed by puckering rotation from ˆx to ˆy. As shown in
Fig. 7, the band structure (b) x = 0.22 is equivalent to the band structure (h) y = 0.30 if the ˆx and ˆy are inverted
(rotation around Γ axis on ﬁgures).
