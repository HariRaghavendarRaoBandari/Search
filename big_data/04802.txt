(Dated: 16 March 2016)

The existence of non-substitutional β-Sn defects in Ge1−xSnx was conﬁrmed by emission channeling exper-
iments [Decoster et al., Phys. Rev. B 81, 155204 (2010)], which established that although most Sn enters
substitutionally (α-Sn) in the Ge lattice, a second signiﬁcant fraction corresponds to the Sn-vacancy de-
fect complex in the split-vacancy conﬁguration ( β-Sn ), in agreement with our previous theoretical study
[Ventura et al., Phys. Rev. B 79, 155202 (2009)]. Here, we present our electronic structure calculation for
Ge1−xSnx, including substitutional α-Sn as well as non-substitutional β-Sn defects. To include the presence of
non-substitutional complex defects in the electronic structure calculation for this multi-orbital alloy problem,
we extended the approach for the purely substitutional alloy by Jenkins and Dow [Jenkins and Dow, Phys.
Rev. B 36, 7994 (1987)]. We employed an eﬀective substitutional two-site cluster equivalent to the real
non-substitutional β-Sn defect, which was determined by a Green’s functions calculation. We then calculated
the electronic structure of the eﬀective alloy purely in terms of substitutional defects, embedding the eﬀective
substitutional clusters in the lattice. Our results describe the two transitions of the fundamental gap of
Ge1−xSnx as a function of the total Sn-concentration: namely from an indirect to a direct gap, ﬁrst, and the
metallization transition at higher x. They also highlight the role of β-Sn in the reduction of the concentration
range which corresponds to the direct-gap phase of this alloy, of interest for optoelectronics applications.

INTRODUCTION

The semiconductor technology based on Si has lim-
itations for optoelectronic and photovoltaic device ap-
plications, related to the indirect nature of the funda-
mental bandgap which results in ineﬃcient absorption
and emission of light. To overcome these limitations, di-
rect energy-gap materials based on group IV semiconduc-
tors have been searched.1–4 Among group-IV elements,
Ge is considered an important candidate to replace Si
in semiconducting applications.1 Compared to Si, Ge
has a larger free-carrier mobility and a lower dopant
activation temperature,2 which makes it an attractive
material in future metal-oxide semiconductor ﬁeld-eﬀect
transistors.5,6

Ge1−xSnx also attracted considerable attention be-
cause it becomes a direct bandgap semiconductor above
∼6-10% Sn without external mechanical strain. The tun-
ability of its gap with composition makes Ge1−xSnx a
highly interesting material for infrared applications, espe-
cially at low Sn concentrations (x < 0.20)7. Theoretical
calculations indicated that strained Ge1−xSnx (x < 0.17)
would exhibit enhanced electron and hole mobility, which
could make the alloy also interesting for high-speed in-
tegrated circuits.8,9 The integration of Ge in Si-based
photonics is important for advances in the performance
of detectors, modulators, and emitters. Recently there
have been reports of room temperature direct bandgap
emission for Si-substrate-based Ge p-i-n heterojunction

photodiode structures, operated under forward bias.10
A temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) study
has been conducted11 in Ge1−xSnx ﬁlms with Sn compo-
sitions of 0.9%, 3.2%, and 6.0% grown on Si. The com-
petition between the direct and indirect bandgap tran-
sitions was clearly observed. The relative peak inten-
sity of the direct transition with respect to the indirect
transition increases with an increase in temperature, in-
dicating the direct transition dominates the PL at high
temperatures. Furthermore, as Sn composition increases,
a progressive enhancement of the PL intensity corre-
sponding to the direct transition was observed,11 due
to the reduction of the direct-indirect valley separation,
which experimentally conﬁrms that Ge1−xSnx grown on
Si becomes a group IV-based direct bandgap material by
increasing the Sn content. More recently, the fabrica-
tion and properties of Ge1−xSnx (x < 0.123) pn diodes
(LEDs) were reported.12 Electroluminiscence results in-
dicated that emission properties depend very sensitively
on the Sn-concentrations on both sides of the junctions,
making this system not only a serious candidate for laser
devices but also an ideal model system to study the prop-
erties of quasi-direct light emitting devices.

Experimental studies in group-IV alloys were hindered
for a long time by sample preparation problems. When
Ge1−xSnx samples are experimentally prepared, the dis-
tribution of the Sn atoms in the Ge matrix depends on
the growth conditions: Sn-atoms can enter randomly,
form a regular superstructure, or coalesce into a larger

cluster. Below 13◦C, pure Sn exists in the α-Sn (gray tin)
phase with diamond structure, but it undergoes a phase
transition to β-Sn (white-tin) above this temperature.13
Experiments have shown that a problem with the incor-
poration of Sn into the Ge lattice is the large ∼ 17%
lattice mismatch between these elements, and the in-
stability of the diamond-cubic structure of α-Sn above
13◦C.4,14 Although Ge1−xSnx alloys have been success-
fully grown by molecular beam epitaxy15, chemical va-
por deposition4, and enhanced direct bandgap lumines-
cence has been demonstrated for up to 8% Sn16,17, at
higher Sn-concentrations several limitations arise due to
the low thermodynamic solid solubility of Sn in the Ge
crystal, which is less than 1% and in many cases the
material quality is questionable due to the propensity of
Sn to segregate toward the ﬁlm surface.4,14,18 Recently,
the fabrication of high quality Ge1−xSnx on InGaAs
buﬀer layers using low-temperature growth by molecu-
lar beam epitaxy was reported.15 X-ray difraction, sec-
ondary ion mass spectroscopy and transmission electron
microscopy studies, demostrated that up to 10.5% Sn
had been incorporated into Ge1−xSnx thin ﬁlms without
Sn precipitation.15 More recently, for Ge1−xSnx homo-
geneous epitaxial layers were grown on InP substrates
for the range 0.15 < x < 0.27.19 the direct bandgap for
the range 0.15 < x < 0.27 was obtained through pho-
ton absorption spectra measured with Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy.

:

Experimentally, a series of values have been reported
for the critical Sn concentration for the indirect to di-
rect gap transition, hereafter denoted xI
starting
c
from Atwater et al.7 whose optical absorption experi-
ments predicted 0.11 < xI
c < 0.15, followed by Ladr´on
de Guevara et al.20 who reported 0.10 < xI
c < 0.13
from transmittance measurements, D’Costa et al.4 re-
ported xI
c ∼ 0.11 with ellipsometry experiments, and
more recently Chen et al.16 reported xI
c ∼ 0.07 using
photoluminescence. Then, xI
c ∼ 0.06 − 0.08 was sug-
gested, based on photoluminescence studies of strain free-
GeSn layers16,17.
In 2013 Ryu et al.21, by means of
temperature-dependent photoluminescence experiments
of Ge/Si and Ge1−ySny/Si, indicated a possible indirect-
to-direct bandgap transition at Sn content ∼ 0.06, con-
sistent with DFT calculations in Ref.
22. More re-
cently, by a ﬁt to experimental data in Ge1−xSnx us-
ing a theoretical model of the bandgap bowing, Gal-
lagher et al.23 estimated a crossover concentration of
xI
c = 0.09, signiﬁcantly increased from earlier estimations
based on a strictly quadratic compositional dependence
of the bandgaps in Ref.24, who obtained xI

c = 0.073.

The incorporation of Sn in the Ge matrix has been
investigated theoretically by Ventura et al.25,26 Through
local defect electronic calculations, the formation of sev-
eral complex Sn-defects in Ge1−xSnx alloy was analyzed:
conﬁrming that at low Sn concentrations substitutional
α-Sn, in which a Sn atom occupies the position of a Ge
atom in the diamond lattice, is favoured. Above a certain
critical Sn concentration25,26 dependent on temperature,

2

Sn could also appear as the non-substitutional β-Sn com-
plex defect, in which an interstitial Sn-atom occupies the
center of a divacancy in the Ge lattice. Metallic Sn clus-
ters resulting in inhomogeneous defect structures could
appear at still higher Sn concentrations.26 In 2010 emis-
sion channeling experiments by S. Decoster et al.27 con-
ﬁrmed the existence of β-Sn defects in the homogeneous
Ge1−xSnx alloy, establishing that they represented the
second signiﬁcant fraction of Sn incorporated in the Ge
lattice, most Sn atoms entering substitutionally (α-Sn) in
Ge. The existence of such a defect in amorphous Ge-Sn
alloys had already been conﬁrmed by detailed M¨ossbauer
experiments,28 which in fact showed a signal correspond-
ing to a Sn atom in an octahedral environment, besides
the expected signal of the tetrahedral environment corre-
sponding to substitutional α-Sn. The local environment
and the interactions of α-Sn, the Ge vacancy and β-Sn,
conﬁrming that β-Sn could be formed by natural diﬀu-
sion of a vacancy around α-Sn because of the small energy
barrier for the process, have been also studied.29

In this work, we concentrate on the electronic struc-
ture calculation for Ge1−xSnx, including substitutional
α-Sn as well as the non-substitutional β-Sn defects. At
present, ab-initio electronic structure calculations can in-
clude individual non-substitutional defects, such as in-
terstitials, but no standard approaches are available to
tackle the problem posed by complex non-substitutional
defects formed by many components. An example of
such complex defects would be an interstitial impurity
atom attached to a divacancy, as is the case for “β-Sn”
defects in Ge.
In order to take into account the non-
substitutional complex defects in the electronic structure
calculation for this multi-orbital alloy problem, we trans-
formed the real alloy problem into an equivalent purely
substitutional eﬀective alloy problem. For this, we em-
ployed an eﬀective substitutional two-site cluster equiv-
alent to the real non-substitutional β-Sn defect, and ex-
tended the approach originally proposed by Jenkins and
Dow30 for the purely substitutional alloy, who used 20
tight-binding (TB) sp3s∗ orbitals for the group IV ele-
ments combined with the virtual crystal approximation
(VCA) for substitutional disorder.

In Sec.

This paper is organized as follows. We present in Sec.
II a brief description of our proposal for the inclusion of β-
Sn non-substitutional defects in the electronic structure
calculation.
II B 1 we discuss the indirect-to-
direct gap transition in Ge1−xSnx, as described by our
present extension of the TB+VCA approach, adjusted
to experimental data. In Appendix A we show how the
present TBA+VCA approach allows to improve the the-
oretical description of experimental direct gap results for
substitutional Ge1−x−ySixSny ternary alloys. The re-
sults of our present electronic structure calculation for
binary Ge1−xSnx with the present approach, including
non-substitutional β-Sn as well as substitutional α-Sn,
are presented in Sec. III. In Sec. IV we summarize the
conclusions of our work.

INCLUSION OF β-SN NON-SUBSTITUTIONAL

II.
COMPLEX DEFECTS IN THE ELECTRONIC
STRUCTURE CALCULATION

Not existing any electronic structure calculation
for Ge1−xSnx taking into account the complex non-
substitutional β-Sn defects, which appear above a critical
Sn concentration26,27, we devised an analytical method
to include them based on an extension of the virtual crys-
tal approximation. A ﬁrst implementation was presented
in Ref.35, though the present proposed method includes
improvements allowing us to reﬁne our description of
Ge1−xSnx. VCA assumes a random alloy to be com-
posed of “virtual” atoms, forming a periodic crystal po-
tential modelled as a composition-weighted average of the
constituent element potentials. To include β-Sn in the
electronic structure calculation, we extend the TB+VCA
approach by Jenkins and Dow30 for the substitutional
Ge1−xSnx alloy. In the latter, only substitutional α-Sn
was assumed to be present, and a 20-orbital TB basis
(s,p,s* states) was introduced for group IV elements. The
20 × 20 Jenkins-Dow tight-binding Hamiltonian includes:
second-neighbor30,31 and spin-orbit interactions.30,32–34
For our present electronic structure calculation, we
start by considering the Ge1−xSnx alloy formed by three
components: Ge, α-Sn and β-Sn atoms, as an eﬀective
binary alloy composed by two components: one, repre-
sented by the (Ge+α-Sn) substitutional alloy as consid-
ered by Jenkins and Dow30, and the other component
represents the β-Sn non-substitutional defects. For the
latter, we propose an eﬀective substitutional 2-site cluster
equivalent to the real non-substitutional β-Sn35, as illus-
trated in Fig. 1 and detailed in next subsection II A. In
subsection II.B we present our extension of the Jenkins-
Dow TB+VCA calculation to treat the eﬀective substi-
tutional binary alloy representing the real alloy with Ge,
α-Sn and β-Sn.

A. Eﬀective substitutional two-site cluster equivalent to
the non-substitutional β-Sn defect

schematically represented in Fig.1.

As mentioned above, in a previous work35 we deter-
mined and compared two eﬀective substitutional two-
site clusters equivalent to the real non-substitutional
β-Sn defects:
In
Fig.1.(a) we depict the real non-substitutional β-Sn de-
fect ( with energy Eγ
β−Sn, where γ represents each basis
orbital (γ = s, p, s∗), in its sixfold coordinated conﬁg-
uration). Meanwhile Fig.1.(b) represents an equivalent
cluster composed by two substitutional sites, where the
eﬀective atoms occupying each site in the cluster have an
energy denoted by Eγ
1 (considered to be equal in both
sites of the cluster, by symmetry).35

The equivalence was established under the following
conditions: (1) for simplicity, we propose that the equiv-
alence is valid for each separate orbital; (2) we assume
that only interactions between orbitals of the same type

between nearest-neighbour (NN) atoms are relevant; and
(3) we demand that the local Green’s functions in the
original and equivalent problems are equal, and will thus
have the same analytical properties.

Due to our investigation in Ref.35, no qualitative diﬀer-
ences are expected for the electronic structure obtained
using equivalent clusters with null intra-cluster hopping
t = 0, or with intra-cluster hopping equal to that between
the cluster and the rest of the lattice: t = t′.

Thus, in our present work we adopt the eﬀective equiv-
alent substitutional cluster with t = 0, to represent the
β-Sn non-substitutional defects. In this case, from Ref.
35 we have:

rameters corresponding to the original β-Sn defect, allow-
ing to incorporate these non-substitutional defects in the
electronic structure calculation of the alloy under study
in terms of substitutional defects.

B. TB+VCA extension to include α-Sn and
non-substitutional β-Sn in the Ge1−xSnx electronic
structure calculation

To obtain the virtual-crystal band structure of
Ge1−xSnx,
including substitutional α-Sn and non-
substitutional β-Sn, we propose the following extension
for the TB+VCA approximation of the substitutional al-
loy originally proposed by Jenkins and Dow.30 We will
use the same basis of 20 tight-binding orbitals ( with s,
p, s∗ character) introduced by Jenkins and Dow for the
group IV elements, but in the diagonal part of the Hamil-
tonian we will add a set of three orbital weight factors,
depending on the orbital character of the basis state, and
take into account the presence of β-Sn. Concretely, we
consider the following matrix elements for the TB+VCA
Hamiltonian of the binary alloy:

Hγ
ii = (1 − x) [Ge]γ
ij = (cid:2)(1 − x)[Ge]γ
Hγ

ii + Wγ (cid:16)xα [α − Sn]γ
ij {aGe}2 + x[α − Sn]γ

{a(x)}2

ii(cid:17) ;

ii + xβ [ ˜β − Sn]γ
ij{aSn}2(cid:3)

(2)

where Hγ

ii and Hγ

ij respectively, denote the diagonal
and non-diagonal matrix elements of the Hamiltonian,
subindices i and j refer to the TB-orbital states and γ
denotes each Hamiltonian block with s, p or s∗ orbital
character. Further details of the structure of this TB
Hamiltonian can be found in Ref.30. By [Ge] and [α-Sn]
we respectively refer to the tight-binding parameters for
pure Ge or for α-Sn, as given in Ref. 30. Meanwhile
[ ˜β-Sn] denotes the TB Hamiltonian matrix elements cor-
responding to the substitutional equivalent used for the
real non-substitutional defect, in our case: [ ˜β-Sn] = Eγ
1
= [β-Sn] + t′. In our present calculations, for simplicity
we have assumed that a Sn-atom has the same tight-
binding parameters in both conﬁgurations: α-Sn and β-
Sn. By xα and xβ we denote the relative concentration
of α-Sn and β-Sn respectively in Ge1−xSnx, therefore:
x = xα + xβ .

In the diagonal matrix elements of the Hamiltonian
above, we introduced three orbital weight factors: Wγ (γ
= s,s∗ or p), in order to reproduce as closely as posible the
band structure of Ge1−xSnx alloys, according to recent
experiments,4,7,23 and in particular improve the descrip-
tion of the indirect to direct gap transition of the substi-
tutional alloy w.r. to the original approach by Jenkins
and Dow30. Wγ were included as factors of the Sn-atoms
contribution to the diagonal matrix elements, as the pure
Ge indirect (and direct) gaps47 are correctly described by
the Jenkins and Dow TB elements30. In following subsec-

tion we will discuss in detail the parametrization adopted
for these Wγ parameters.

Notice that we adopt the non-diagonal Hamiltonian
matrix elements of Jenkins and Dow,30 which include the
lattice parameters for Ge and α-Sn, namely: aGe = 5.65
˚A, and aSn = 6.46 ˚A, and we are assuming that Vegard’s
law36 is valid for the binary alloy lattice parameter, thus:
a(x) = (1 − x)aGe + xaSn.

The present extension of TB+VCA enables us to
tackle two important issues in Ge1−xSnx: 1) as already
mentioned, a more realistic description of the crossover
from indirect to direct fundamental bandgap, accord-
ing to recent experiments, and 2) the inclusion of non-
substitutional complex β-Sn defects in the electronic
structure calculation, which have been conﬁrmed to ex-
ist by experiments, and as we will show would play an
important role in the electronic properties of Ge1−xSnx,
basically limiting the direct gap phase of interest for op-
toelectronics applications.

1. Parametrization of Wγ : indirect to direct gap
transition in substitutional Ge1−xSnx

Now, we will explain how we optimized the values of
the weight parameters: Wγ (γ = s,s∗ or p), introduced in
Eq.2, in order to properly reproduce the available exper-
imental data of Ge1−xSnx alloys, and in particular the
critical Sn-concentration xI
c for the indirect to direct gap
transition in substitutional Ge1−xSnx.

Using the original TB+VCA approach for substitu-
tional Ge1−xSnx by Jenkins and Dow30 one obtains that
xI
c−JD = 0.1526. Recently, other theoretical predictions
were reported: xI
c = 0.17 was obtained with a charge self-
consistent pseudo-potential plane wave method37, xI
c =
0.11 with the empirical pseudopotential method with ad-
justable form factors ﬁtted to experimental data38, while
the full potential augmented plane wave plus local orbital
method within density functional theory(DFT) yielded:
c = 0.105.39 Gupta et al.40 predicted xI
xI
c =0.065, using a
theoretical model based on the nonlocal empirical pseu-
dopotential method. Eckhardt et al.,41 predicted xI
c ∼
0.1 for Ge1−xSnx grown commensurately on Ge(100) sub-
strates, using a supercell approach and VCA, with DFT
in the local density approximation.

Our extension of the TB+VCA described in subsection
II B includes three orbital weight parameters Wγ (γ = s,
s∗ or p), which we introduced to improve the ﬁt of the TB
model to experimental electronic structure results. They
enable us to construct a TB model to correctly repro-
duce the experimental data reported for the indirect and
direct bandgaps of Ge and Ge1−xSnx at particular alloy
concentrations.4,7,16 In our present work, we adjusted Wγ
(γ = s,s∗ or p), using experimental data for the indirect
and direct bandgaps of pure Ge (x = 0) and Ge0.85Sn0.15:
obtained by He and Atwater7 through optical absorption
experiments, and conﬁrmed nine years later by transmit-
tance measurements by D’Costa et al.4 The set of optimal

B TB+VCA extension to include α-Sn and non-substitutional β-Sn in the Ge1−xSnx electronic structure calculation5

weight factors obtained by ﬁtting these data are:

Ws = 1.256 , Ws∗ = 1.020 , Wp = 1.00

(3)

Regarding the choice of the weight factors speciﬁed in
Equation 3, it was done taking into account our study of
the orbital character of the eigenvectors along the Bril-
louin zone (BZ),35 and in particular at the symmetry
points which deﬁne the fundamental bandgap, depend-
ing on the alloy composition: namely the BZ center, Γ,
with the relevant valence band maximum, and the con-
duction band minimum determining the direct gap, and
BZ point L = (2π/a(x))(1/2, 1/2, 1/2) where the con-
duction band minimum determining the indirect gap in
Ge lies. At Γ, we ﬁnd that the eigenvectors correspond
mainly to s-states at the conduction band minimum and
mainly p-states at the valence band maximum, while at
L the eigenvectors correspond mostly to (s + s∗)-states,
though a minor proportion of p-character is retained, and
these results do not exhibit signiﬁcant changes increasing
Sn-concentration. Meanwhile, increasing x the energy of
the valence band maximum at Γ remains almost ﬁxed,
while it is the energies of the conduction band minima
at  L and Γ which are changed.35 Based on these facts we
set Wp = 1.00, and proceeded to adjust Ws and Ws∗ to
ﬁt the experimental direct and indirect bandgaps4,7,16 at
x = 0.15.

Henceforward, the set of values for Wγ speciﬁed in Eq.3
will be kept constant for all electronic structure calcula-
tions in this work. Notice that the only change to the ma-
trix elements of the tight-binding Hamiltonian of Jenkins
and Dow30, due to the introduction of these optimized
weight factors Wγ in Eq.2, appears in the diagonal TB
parameters for α-Sn (and β-Sn in our approximation),
here given by: Es = −7.3853eV and Es∗ = 6.0180eV.

In Table I, we show a comparison between the direct
and indirect bandgaps obtained with the TB+VCA ap-
proach described above and the experimental results re-
ported in Ref. 7 for them. As expected, there is agree-
ment for x = 0 and x = 0.15, used for our ﬁts, but at in-
termediate Sn concentrations, the calculated values show
some deviations from the experimental ones, as discussed
in next section.

A considerable improvement is obtained for the pre-
dicted critical Sn-concentration for the transition from an
indirect to a direct fundamental gap in Ge1−xSnx, which

the present approach places in the vecinity of xI
c = 0.088
( with the optimized Wγ values, speciﬁed in Eq.3). This
is much closer to the recently reported experimental val-
ues detailed in the Introduction than the prediction of
xI
c−JD ∼ 0.15, obtained26 using the original TB+VCA
by Jenkins and Dow30.

Finally, before discussing in detail the results obtained
with our approach in next section, we would like to com-
ment on two recent parametrizations of the tight binding
parameters,43,44 and compare them with those including
spin orbit interaction and up to second-nearest neighbour
eﬀects proposed by Jenkins and Dow in 1987.30

In 2013, K¨ufner et al.,43 studied the structural and
electronic properties of pure α-Sn nanocrystals from ﬁrst
principles, using DFT within approximations based on
the hybrid exchange-correlation functional and includ-
ing spin-orbit interaction eﬀects. They reported a list
of ﬁrst-NN tight-binding parameters for α-Sn with some
diﬀerences with respect to those of Refs.30 and 45. Re-
placing in the TB+VCA approach by Jenkins and Dow30
the ﬁrst-NN tight-binding parameters of pure α-Sn by
those of K¨ufner et al.43, we ﬁnd that the prediction for
the indirect to direct gap transition in Ge1−xSnx would
be shifted from xI

c−JD ∼ 0.1526,30 to xI

c ∼ 0.10.

In 2014, based on the ﬁrst-NN tight-binding param-
eters for pure Ge of Vogl et al.45 and those by K¨ufner
for α-Sn43, Attiaoui et al.44 presented a semi-
et al.
empirical second-NN tight-binding calculation of the
electronic structure of Ge1−x−ySixSny ternary alloys as
well as Ge1−xSnx. Using the same 20 basis states as
Refs.30, 43, and 45, they evaluated new TB parameters
for the alloy components, with some changes to the pre-
vious ones also including second-neighbours and spin or-
bit corrections30. For the indirect to direct gap transi-
tion in substitutional unstrained Ge1−xSnx they obtain
c ∼ 0.11, which is smaller than xI
xI
c−JD ∼ 0.15 and agrees
with the experimental data of Ref. 4, though it overes-
timates more recent experimental values mentioned in
the Introduction.16,17,23 Concerning the electronic struc-
ture study of substitutional unstrained Ge1−x−ySixSny
ternary alloys, the prediction of Ref.44 is consistent with
previous results55 obtained using an extension of the
TB+VCA by Jenkins and Dow30. In particular, almost
equal critical concentration values (with minor diﬀer-
ences possibly related to the use of diﬀerent pure Sn-
lattice parameter values44,55) are predicted for the tran-
sition of the indirect gap: between two diﬀerent relevant
conduction band minima deﬁning the gap (one Ge-like at
Brillouin zone point L, and the other Si-like).

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Here, we will present electronic structure results ob-
tained using our approach described in previous sec-
tion, divided in two subsections.
In the ﬁrst one,
we will discuss and compare in detail with recent
experiments our results for the low Sn-concentration

regime: where only substitutional α-Sn is expected
to be present.
In the second subsection, we show
our predictions for Ge1−xSnx alloys at higher Sn-
concentrations where, above a temperature-dependent
critical Sn-concentration, also non-substitutional β-Sn
defects are expected to be present25,26.
In particular,
for each of these two regimes, we discuss the fundamen-
tal gap transition of Ge1−xSnx which is expected to take
place.

A. Substitutional alloy: results of the present approach
for Ge+α-Sn

Using the TB+VCA approach described in previous
section for Ge1−xSnx alloys in the low x regime, where all
Sn atoms occupy substitutional positions in the Ge lat-
tice, we obtained the results exhibited in Fig. 2. There,
we show the compositional dependence of the direct (E0)
and indirect (EI ) bandgaps of Ge1−xSnx obtained with
the present approach, intersecting at xI
c = 0.088 where
the indirect to direct transition of the fundamental gap is
thus predicted. For comparison, we included a series of
recently available experimental data,4,7,15,16,20,23,51 and
also show the indirect to direct gap transition prediction
of xI
c−JD = 0.15, obtained using the original TB+VCA
approach,26,30 which yields a gap value of 0.568 eV at
that Sn-concentration, much higher than the observed
fundamental direct gap of 0.346 eV7 detailed in Table I.

Comparing our results with the experimental data in
Fig. 2, one sees that a relatively good description of the
compositional dependence of the direct and indirect gaps
is obtained, indeed much better than if a linear interpola-
tion between the respective gap values for pure Ge and α-
Sn was used.4,7,16 Nevertheless, small deviations from lin-
earity in the data are evident,4,7,42 as experimentally re-
42. Many
ported also for the lattice constant of Ge1−xSnx
other binary semiconducting alloys AxB1−x also exhibit
similar non-linear dependences of their physical proper-
ties as a function of alloy composition, behaviour known
as bowing eﬀects. Though VCA cannot describe non-
linear bowing eﬀects, it nevertheless often yields good
qualitative results.4

Fig.3(a) shows the total density of states obtained
for Ge1−xSnx as a function of energy, at substitutional-
Sn concentrations: x = 0.0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.30.
In agree-
ment with the results obtained using the ab-initio
FPLO5+CPA code48 in Ref.26, notice that a smooth be-
haviour as function of Sn concentration is obtained, with
changes in the bandwidth, and a progressive reduction of
the gap around the ω = 0 with Sn concentration. Exper-
4,7,16,20,51 conﬁrmed that the direct
iments in Ge1−xSnx
gap decreases primarily through a Sn-content increase in
the alloy.1,4,7

In Fig. 3(b), we show the total and the three partial
densities of states as a function of energy for Ge0.78Sn0.22
substitutional alloy. Around the bandgap two peaks are
visible in the density of states: the peak located just
below the gap is clearly dominated by p orbital contri-
butions, while p, s and s∗ orbitals contribute to the peak
located just above the gap. Moreover, we can see that
the lowest band (∼ -12 eV) corresponds essentially to s
orbitals, while the highest band (∼ 10 eV) is originated
essentially by s∗ and p orbitals, as in pure Ge. These
features also agree with the FPLO5+CPA results26,48.

In Fig. 4, we show the band structure obtained for the
substitutional Ge0.78Sn0.22 alloy. In order to analyze the
fundamental bandgap in Ge1−xSnx, we focus on three
speciﬁc BZ points which deﬁne it: the maximum of the
valence band at Γ, the minima of the conduction band at
Γ and at L, with energies denoted Γ0, Γ1 and L1 respec-
tively. Notice that Ge0.78Sn0.22 possesses a fundamental
direct gap : 0.132 eV = Γ1 − Γ0 , and as indirect gap:
0.334 eV = L1 − Γ0. Moreover, analyzing the orbital-
character of the band structure: we found that the eigen-
vectors corresponding to Γ0 and Γ1, are mainly due to
p and s states, respectively. Meanwhile, the eigenvectors
at L1 are due to s and s∗ states. These results are analo-
gous to those obtained for pure Ge, which indicates that
the relative weights of the orbital contributions to the
electronic properties of Ge1−xSnx are weakly dependent
of Sn-content in the substitutional alloy.

B. Ge1−xSnx: TB+VCA results including α-Sn and β-Sn,
metallization transition

In previous

to a direct bandgap at xI

section, we showed that Ge1−xSnx
possesses an indirect fundamental gap at low Sn-
concentrations, and that by increasing Sn-concentration
the substitutional binary alloy undergoes a crossover
from an indirect
c ∼
0.088. At higher Sn-concentrations, non-substitutional
β-Sn defects appear in the binary alloy, as predicted
theoretically25,26 and conﬁrmed by experiments27. We
will now show that the presence of β-Sn reduces the con-
centration range where Ge1−xSnx possesses a direct gap,
i.e.
at which
the direct gap closes, corresponding to the metallization
transition.

it reduces the critical concentration xII
c

We analyzed the eﬀect of both substitutional and non-
substitutional Sn defects on the electronic structure of
Ge1−xSnx employing the TB+VCA extension proposed
in the present work, detailed in Section II.

To assess the eﬀect of β-Sn defects on the electronic
structure, in particular, on the bandgaps, in Fig. 5(a), we
plot the TB+VCA band structure of Ge0.78Sn0.22 along
the L − Γ − X Brillouin zone path, for a ﬁxed total Sn-
concentration x = xα + xβ = 0.22, but diﬀerent relative
contents of α-Sn and non-substitutional β-Sn. Notice
that when xβ increases, for example from 0 to 0.035, the
bandgap decreases: a progressive reduction of the direct
gap at Γ upon increase of the β-Sn concentration is ob-
served. In Fig. 5(b), we show the eﬀect of β-Sn upon the
DOS, for ﬁxed total Sn-concentration x = 0.22 and vary-
ing the relative β-Sn content in the alloy. The changes in-
duced by increasing β-Sn concentration on the density of
states are less noticeable than those obtained in the band
structure (see Fig. 5(a)). The progressive reduction of
the gap conﬁrms that the presence of non-substitutional
β-Sn favours the metallization in Ge1−xSnx.

In Fig. 6 we plot the direct gap energy E0, for the
binary alloy with ﬁxed total Sn-concentration x = 0.22
as a function of xβ ( i.e. xα = 0.22−xβ ), for four diﬀerent
values of hopping t′ between β−Sn and its Ge nearest-
neighbours. A linear dependence of E0 as a function of
xβ is obtained. The critical concentration xII
c at which
the direct gap closes, and the alloy becomes metallic, is
strongly dependent on t′ in our approach.

Analyzing the eﬀect of non-substitutional β-Sn on the
total and partial densities of states, using our TB+VCA
approach we ﬁnd that the relative weights of the orbital

contributions to the electronic properties of Ge1−xSnx
are weakly dependent of Sn-content.

Experimentally, the critical Sn-concentration xII
c

for
the metallization transition in Ge1−xSnx is yet unknown.
As shown in Fig.2 gap measurements were reported at
relatively low Sn-concentrations: x < 0.154,7,16,20,38,52.
More recently, the direct gap was determined in ho-
mogeneous epitaxial layers of Ge1−xSnx grown on InP
substrates19 for 0.15 < x < 0.27, from photon absorption
spectra measured with Fourier transform infrared spec-
troscopy.
In particular, for Ge0.73Sn0.27 Nakatsuka et
al.19 obtained a direct gap of ∼0.25 eV, so that the metal-
lization of these epitaxial layers would occur at x > 0.27.
Additional measurements for higher Sn-concentrations
would be required to locate the metallization transition
in bulk Ge1−xSnx. Extrapolating experimental data ﬁts,

two predictions for xII
Atwater et al.7, and xII

On the other hand, Jenkins and Dow predicted xII

c were obtained: xII
c ∼ 0.30 by
c ∼ 0.37 by V.R. D’Costa et al.4
c ∼
0.6230 with their original TB+VCA approach for substi-
tutional Ge1−xSnx. If we would consider only substitu-
tional α-Sn to be present and use our present TB+VCA
extension, we would predict for the transition from a di-
rect gap to a metallic regime: xII
c ∼ 0.26, same value
which can be obtained if using the TB parameters for
α-Sn reported in Ref. 43.

In 2009 we proposed a statistical model for the for-
mation of β-Sn defects in Ge1−xSnx,25,26 from which the
relative concentrations of β-Sn ( and α-Sn) in the alloy
can be obtained as a function of temperature and the
total Sn-concentration x.

Using the statistical model25,26 to determine xβ in
Ge1−xSnx ( and from it: xα = x − xβ ) , we can explore
the dependence of the critical concentration for metalliza-
tion xII
c on the only free parameter (t′) in our present ap-
proach. Furthermore, if xII
c were experimentally known,
it might be used to tune the free parameter t′. In Figure
7 we address this issue, by plotting t′ corresponding to
xII
c values in the range from 0.22 to 0.5 for diﬀerent tem-
peratures T . Speciﬁcally for T = 16 ◦C, 32 ◦C, 62 ◦C,
85 ◦C and 131 ◦C, while the relative contents xβ and xα
are obtained from the statistical model25,26

Figure 7 shows that for 0.22 ≤ xII

c < 0.26, t′ is negative
and increases monotonically with increasing xII
c . On the
other hand, for xII
c ≥ 0.26, t′ is positive. Note that, all
of these graphs in Fig. 7 intersect at xII
c = 0.26, which
corresponds to t′ = 0: which in our model is equivalent
to considering only substitutional Sn to be present.

For instance, if we consider the temperature T = 16◦C,
by adjusting t′ ∼ 1.0037 eV we would obtain a value
xII
c = 0.30, as suggested extrapolating the experiments

a decrease in xII

served. These results indicate that increasing the non-
substitutional Sn content leads to a lower xII
c , i.e. con-
ﬁrming that the presence of β-Sn favours metallization.

c −xI

As we mentioned in the Introduction, the main interest
for technological applications of Ge1−xSnx is linked to its
direct gap phase.1,4 However, our results show that the
concentration range (∆x = xII
c ), in which Ge1−xSnx
possesses a direct fundamental gap would be reduced if
the temperature of formation of the alloy is increased,
since β-Sn might appear at lower Sn-concentrations.
An important aspect in the fabrication of high-quality
thin ﬁlms using molecular beam epitaxy is the growth-
temperature1,4,53,54. Therefore, a detailed experimental
study of the electronic properties of these alloys, includ-
ing the second gap transition (metallization), could allow
to determine the optimal growth conditions to control the
proportion of β-Sn in Ge1−xSnx.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the eﬀect of β-Sn non-substitutional
complex defects on the electronic structure of the
Ge1−xSnx binary alloy.

In order to include non-substitutional complex defects
in an electronic structure calculation, we presented our
extension of the method originally proposed by Jenk-
ins and Dow for substitutional Ge1−xSnx, using 20
tight-binding sp3s∗ orbitals for the group IV elements
combined with the virtual crystal approximation. We
included the complex non-substitutional β-Sn defects
through the introduction of an eﬀective substitutional
two-site equivalent cluster for them, which we appropri-
ately embedded in the lattice to calculate the electronic
structure of the eﬀective alloy purely in terms of substi-
tutional defects.

Our method allows to describe the two transitions of
the fundamental gap of Ge1−xSnx as a function of the
total Sn concentration. In particular:
i) with our pro-
posed extension for the tight-binding matrix, we could
tune the critical Sn concentration xI
c for the transition
from an indirect to a direct gap, in agreement with the
most recent experimental data. Our extension also im-
proves the theoretical description of the direct gap ex-
perimental values for ternary Ge1−x−ySixSny alloys, as
shown in the Appendix. ii) The metallization transition
( closure of the direct gap) of Ge1−xSnx at higher x = xII
c
can also be described, and we demonstrated the relevance
of non-substitutional β-Sn for the determination of xII
c .
In fact, if xII
c would be measured it could be used to de-
termine the hopping parameter (t′) between β-Sn defects
and the Ge matrix, only free parameter of our model. iii)
We predict the eﬀect of temperature on the metallization
transition xII
c (T ) (not yet experimentally measured), re-
sulting from the increase with temperature of the ratio
xβ/xα between the concentrations of non-substitutional
to substitutional Sn in Ge (which we obtain from our
statistical model for Ge1−xSnx).

We believe that the physical properties of Ge1−xSnx
are strongly aﬀected by Sn complex defects in the Ge
matrix , such as β-Sn among others26, and future experi-
mental work would provide further support and increase
the usefulness of the present approach. Furthermore, the
general idea we proposed to include non-substitutional
complex defects in electronic structure calculations, by
determining eﬀective substitutional equivalent clusters to
replace them and solve the problem in terms of purely
substitutional eﬀective alloys, has a wide potential for
applications in other systems.

sults for the direct gap with recent experimental results56
for ﬁve ternary alloys with diﬀerent lattice parameters (
shown as inset): within the experimental error bars the
agreement is indeed very good for all samples, greatly
improved w.r. to the direct gap values predicted by the
previous TB+VCA approach55.
