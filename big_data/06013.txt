Let Cd,k be the largest number of vertices in a Cayley digraph of degree d and
diameter k, and let BCd,k be the largest order of a bipartite Cayley digraph
for given d and k. For every degree d ≥ 2 and for every odd k we construct
and diameter at most k, where k ≥ 3,

Cayley digraphs of order 2k(cid:0)⌊ d
and bipartite Cayley digraphs of order 2(k − 1)(cid:0)⌊ d
k, where k ≥ 5. These constructions yield the bounds Cd,k ≥ 2k(cid:0)⌊ d
odd k ≥ 3 and d ≥ 3k
for odd k ≥ 5
and d ≥ 3k−1
k−1 + 1. Our constructions give the best currently known bounds
on the orders of large Cayley digraphs and bipartite Cayley digraphs of given
degree and odd diameter k ≥ 5. In our proofs we use new techniques based on
properties of group automorphisms of direct products of abelian groups.

1. Introduction

The study of large graphs of given degree and diameter has often been re-
stricted to special classes of graphs. A particularly useful class is that of Cayley
graphs, since their inherent symmetry enables to calculate their diameter by
determining distances just from one vertex.

A directed Cayley graph (or simply Cayley digraph) G = Cay(Γ, X) is
speciﬁed by an underlying group Γ and by a unit-free generating set X for this
group. Vertices of Cay(Γ, X) are the elements of Γ, that is the vertex set V (G)
is equal to Γ, and there is a directed edge from the vertex u to the vertex v
if and only if there is a generator x ∈ X such that ux = v. Note that in a

Cayley digraph all vertices have the same in-degree and out-degree, thus we
will call this number the degree of the Cayley digraph. Since the mapping
ϕh : g → hg, g ∈ V (G) is a digraph automorphism for every h ∈ Γ, Cayley
digraphs are vertex-transitive.

We study Cayley digraphs of large order for given degree and diameter. Let
Cd,k be the largest number of vertices in a Cayley digraph of degree d and
diameter k. Clearly, the number of vertices in a digraph of maximum degree d
and diameter k can not exceed the Moore bound Md,k = 1 + d + d2 + · · ·+ dk and
therefore Cd,k ≤ Md,k. Complete digraphs are the largest Cayley digraphs of
diameter 1. They yield the result Cd,1 = Md,1 = d+1. ˇZd´ımalov´a and Stanekov´a
[7] studied vertex-transitive digraphs of [2] and showed that Cd,2 = d2 + d for
d = q − 1, where q ≥ 3 is a prime power, and Cd,3 ≥ d3 − d, where d ≥ 3 is a
prime power. More general mixed Cayley graphs of diameter 2 were studied by
for any k ≥ 3 and d ≥ 4.
We improve this result for odd diameters. For odd k ≥ 3 and for d ≥ 2 we
, degree d and diameter at most k,

ˇSiagiov´a [5]. In [6] it was proved that Cd,k ≥ k(cid:0)(cid:4) d
construct Cayley digraphs of order 2k(cid:0)(cid:4) d
and we show that Cd,k ≥ 2k(cid:0)(cid:4) d

Now let us consider bipartite Cayley digraphs. Let BCd,k denote the largest
possible number of vertices in a bipartite Cayley digraph of degree d and diam-
eter k. Aider [1] showed that the number of vertices in a bipartite digraph is at
most 2(1+d2 +· · ·+dk−1) if k is odd, and 2d(1+d2 +· · ·+dk−2) if k is even. The
largest Cayley digraphs of diameter 2 are the complete bipartite digraphs, thus
BCd,2 = 2d for any d ≥ 2. Constructions of bipartite Cayley digraphs presented
2(cid:5)(cid:1)k−1
in [6] yield the bounds BCd,3 ≥ 2d2 for d ≥ 2, BCd,k ≥ 2(k−1)(cid:0)(cid:4) d
if k ≥ 4
is even and d ≥ 4 and BCd,k ≥ (k − 1)(cid:0)(cid:4) d
present a construction of bipartite Cayley digraphs of order 2(k − 1)(cid:0)(cid:4) d
degree d ≥ 2 and diameter at most k, where k ≥ 5 is odd. For d > 3k−1
obtain the bound BCd,k ≥ 2(k − 1)(cid:0)(cid:4) d

2. Preliminaries

Let H be any additive abelian group of order n with unit element 0 and let
H k = H × H × · · · × H be the direct product of k copies of H. Elements of H k
will be written in the form ~h = (h1, h2, . . . , hk), hi ∈ H, i ∈ {1, 2 . . . , k} and the
group operation will be deﬁned by ~h · ~h′ = (h1, h2, . . . , hk) · (h′

Lemma 1. Let k = 2q + ǫ, where q ≥ 1 is an integer, ǫ ∈ {0, 1}, k 6= 2,
and let Sym(k) be the symmetric group on k symbols 1, 2, . . . , k. Let Aq,ǫ =
(1, 2, 3, . . . , k) be a k-cycle and let Bq,ǫ be products of the following disjunct
transpositions:
Bq,0 = (1, q)(2, q − 1) . . . ( q

Proof. The dihedral group Dk of order 2k has the standard presentation in the
form Dk = hA, B|Ak = B2 = 1, BAB = A−1i. It is easy to verify that Ak
q,ǫ = I,
q,ǫ = I and that Bq,ǫAq,ǫBq,ǫ = (Aq,ǫ)−1.
where k is the true order of Aq,ǫ, B2
q,ǫBq,ǫ 6= Aj
Since Ai
q,ǫBq,ǫ for i, j ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k − 1}, i 6= j,
the group Tq,ǫ has order 2k. Therefore the mapping ψ : Tq,ǫ → Dk given by
Aq,ǫ → A and Bq,ǫ → B is a group isomorphism.

q,ǫ 6= Aj

Example 2. For the ﬁrst four values of k we have:
k = 3 (q = 1, ǫ = 1), A1,1 = (123), B1,1 = (23),
k = 4 (q = 2, ǫ = 0), A2,0 = (1234), B2,0 = (12)(34),
k = 5 (q = 2, ǫ = 1), A2,1 = (12345), B2,1 = (12)(35),
k = 6 (q = 3, ǫ = 0), A3,0 = (123456), B3,0 = (13)(46).

In what follows we will write Dk instead of Tq,ǫ, where Dk = Tq,0 for k
even and Dk = Tq,1 for odd k. Let Γk = H k ⋊ϕ Dk be a semidirect product of
the group H k and the group Dk represented as Tq,ǫ. Note that to simplify the
notation we will often omit the subscript k. Elements of Γ will be written in
the form ~h · C, ~h ∈ H k, C ∈ Dk and the product of two elements of Γ is given
by:

~hC · ~h′C ′ = (h1, h2, . . . , hk)C · (h′

C(1), h2 + h′

1, h′

2, . . . , h′

k)C ′
C(2), . . . , hk + h′

C(k))CC ′,

(1)

where CC ′ is the product of C and C ′ in Dk. In the homomorphism ϕ : Dk →
Aut(H k), elements of Dk induce permutations of coordinates of ~h. If the order
of H is n, then the group Γ has the order |Γ| = 2knk. For an element g = ~hC
of Γ we say that ~h is the preﬁx P (g) of g and that C is the suﬃx S(g) of g.

In what follows we will use the following notation for some special elements

of Γ:

a(x) = (x, 0, . . . , 0)A, x ∈ H,

where A = Aq,ǫ is the element of Tq,ǫ deﬁned in Lemma 1, and

b(x) = (x, 0, . . . , 0, x, 0, . . . , 0)B, x ∈ H,

(2)

(3)

where x occurs in the ﬁrst and (q + 1)-st coordinate and B = Bq,ǫ is the element
of Tq,ǫ deﬁned in Lemma 1.

Let Γ = H k ⋊ϕ Dk be the underlying group and let X = {a(x), b(x)|x ∈ H}
be the generating set for the Cayley digraph G = Cay(Γ, X). The graph G has

2(cid:1)k
degree d = |X| = 2n and order 2knk = 2k(cid:0) d

, if d is even.

Let w = C1C2 . . . Ck, Ci ∈ {A, B}, i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k}, be a word in Dk. We
say that the product C = C1 · C2 · . . . · Ck = V (w) is the value of the word
w. The ﬁber over the word w is the set of all sequences γ1, γ2, . . . , γk such that
γi = a(xi) if Ci = A and γi = b(xi) if Ci = B, xi ∈ H. We denote the set of
sequences by ~γw or simply by ~γ. For given ~x ∈ H k, the value of ~γw(~x) is the
product V (~γ(~x)) = γ1(x1) · γ2(x2) · · · · γk(xk).

Note that the previous deﬁnitions have a simple interpretation.

If G =
Cay(Γ, X) is a Cayley digraph and w is a word in Dk, then the ﬁber ~γw over w
is the set of all oriented walks of length k starting at 1Γ and such that the vertices
on the walks have suﬃces C1, C1 · C2, C1 · C2 · C3, . . . , C = V (w), respectively.
Since V (~γw(~x)) is an element of Γ, it has the form V (~γw(~x)) = ~z·C, where ~z ∈
H k and C = V (w) ∈ Dk. It is easy to see that for ~z we have ~z = (z1, z2, . . . , zk),
where zi = mi,1x1 + mi,2x2 + · · · + mi,kxk, such that mi,j is either 0 or 1 and
that m1,j + m2,j + · · · + mk,j is equal to 1 if γi is a(xi) or 2 if γi is b(xi). Now,
let

V (~γw(~x)) = (m1,1x1 + m1,2x2 + · · · + m1,kxk,
m2,1x1 + m2,2x2 + · · · + m2,kxk,
...
mk,1x1 + mk,2x2 + · · · + mk,kxk) · C.

The ﬁber matrix over the word w is the square matrix M = M (w) of degree k
and of the form

M (w) =

Clearly, i-th row of M corresponds to the i-th coordinate of ~z and j-th

column of M corresponds to the j-th generator of ~γw(~x).

Example 3. Let q = 2 and ǫ = 1. Then k = 2q +1 = 5, a(x) = (x, 0, 0, 0, 0)A =
(x, 0, 0, 0, 0)(12345) and b(x) = (x, 0, x, 0, 0)B = (x, 0, x, 0, 0)(12)(35). If, for
example, w = ABBAB, then ~γw(~x) = a(x1)A, b(x2)B, b(x3)B, a(x4)A, b(x5)B
and after a computation we have V (~γw(~x)) = a(x1)A · b(x2)B · b(x3)B · a(x4)A ·
b(x5)B = (x1 + x3, x2 + x4, x3 + x5, x2, x5) · A2B. The ﬁber matrix over the word

w is M (w) =

One sees that for given word w and for the ﬁber matrix M = M (w) over w

we have P (V (~γw(~x))) = (M ~xT )T = ~xM T (note that P (g) is the preﬁx of g).

Deﬁnition 4. We say that the ﬁber ~γw over the word w covers the element
C = V (w) of Dk if for every ~y = (y1, y2, . . . , yk) ∈ H k there is a vector ~x =
(x1, x2, . . . , xk) ∈ H k such that M ~xT = ~yT .

The deﬁnition says that ~γw covers C = V (w) if for every vertex g of G =
Cay(Γ, X) with suﬃx S(g) = C there is an oriented walk of length k from 1Γ to
the vertex g such that the vertices on the walk have suﬃces C1, C1 · C2, . . . , C =
V (w).

Lemma 5. Let ~γw cover C = V (w) and let ~y0 ∈ H k. Then there exists exactly
one ~x0 ∈ H k such that M ~xT

0 = ~yT
0 .

Proof. Since ~γw covers C, for every ~y0 ∈ H k there exists a vector ~x0 ∈ H k such
that M ~xT

0 . Now we show that this ~x0 is unique.

0 = ~yT

In the Cayley digraph G = Cay(Γ, X) there are exactly nk vertices of the
form ~xC. The lemma in fact says that for every vertex g ∈ G of the form
g = ~xC there is exactly one oriented walk from 1Γ to g such that the suﬃces of
the vertices g1, g2, . . . , gk, where gk = g, on the walk are the elements C1, C1 ·
C2, . . . , C = V (w) of Dk. Since the group H has order n, there is at most
nk terminal vertices of ~γw. On the other hand, every vertex with suﬃx C (its
number is also nk) is reachable from 1Γ by a walk ~γw(~x0) (since ~γ covers C).

Corollary 6. Let ~γw cover C = V (w) and let M be the ﬁber matrix over w.
Then the mapping µ : H k → H k given by µ(~x) = ~xM T is a group automorphism.

Proof. By Deﬁnition 4, for every ~y ∈ H k there is a vector ~x ∈ H k such that
µ(~x) = ~y and by Lemma 5 the mapping µ is a bijection.
It is easy to see
that for ~x = ~x1 + ~x2 we have µ(~x1 + ~x2) = µ(~x) = ~xM T = (~x1 + ~x2)M T =
~x1M T + ~x2M T = µ(~x1) + µ(~x2). Therefore µ is a bijective group endomorphism
of the group H k and therefore a group automorphism.

Deﬁnition 7. We say that a column j (row i) of a matrix M is of type I if it
contains exactly one unit and it is of type II if it contains two (two or more)
1’s.

Lemma 8. Let M be a zero-one matrix of order k ≥ 1 with det(M ) = ±1 such
that in any column of M there are at most two 1’s. Then there is at least one
row of type I in M .

Proof. Let l ∈ {0, . . . , k} be the number of columns of type II in M . The
assertion is true for k = 1 and for every k > 1, l < k. For k = l = 2 the
determinant of M is equal to 0. Now let l = k ≥ 3. If there is no row of type
I, then in every row of the matrix there are exactly two ’1’-s. Therefore we
have a zero-one matrix of order k ≥ 3 with equal row and column sum 2. It
is easy to verify that the determinant of such a matrix is an even number – a
contradiction.

Lemma 9. Let w be a word in Dk and let the ﬁber matrix M = M (w) be a
matrix with det(M ) = ±1. Then ~γw covers C = V (w).

5

0 = M ~xT

1 = ~yT

0 6= M ~xT

Proof. It is suﬃcient to show that for every pair of diﬀerent elements ~x0 6= ~x1
of H k we have M ~xT
1 . We prove the lemma by a contradiction. Let
0 . That is, M ~xT = ~0T for
~x0 6= ~x1 and ~y0 in H k be such that M ~xT
some non-zero vector ~x of H k. Since M is a zero-one matrix with determinant
±1 and such that there are at most two 1’s in any column of M , there is (by
Lemma 8) at least one row, say i, of type I in M . Let the 1 of this row be in a
column j. The 1 is the only 1 in the row, thus from the deﬁnition of ﬁber matrix
it follows that to get yi = 0 we have to set xj = 0. Now we can omit the row
i and the column j to get a new matrix M ′ (corresponding to a new mapping
M ′ : H k−1 → H k−1). Since M ′ is again a zero-one matrix with determinant
±1 and with at most two 1’s in any column, there is at least one row of type
I in M ′ and we can continue with the process. In this way, after (k − 1) steps,
we get 1 × 1 matrix ˜M with entry ˜m1,1 = 1. The entry corresponds to a row i′
and column j ′ of M . To obtain yi′ = 0 we have to set xj ′ = 0. Therefore ~x is
the zero vector of H k – a contradiction.

Note 10. We have already seen that if ~γw covers V (w), then the mapping
µ(~x) = ~xM T is a group automorphism. Lemma 9 in fact says, that if M has
det(M ) = ±1, then the mapping µ(~x) = ~xM T is a group automorphism as well.

3. Results

In this section we study products of k = 2q + ǫ, ǫ ∈ {0, 1}, generators
(elements of X) in terms of matrices M (w) over the corresponding word w.
More precisely, for a given set S of elements of Dk, for each C ∈ S we ﬁnd
a word w in Dk such that V (w) = C and the ﬁber matrix M over w has
determinant equal to ±1.

To simplify the notation, in the lemmas that follow we will write a(i) for
the generator which yields the column of M with the i-th entry equal to 1,
1 ≤ i ≤ k. Similarly, we will write b(j, j ′) for the generator with the j-th
and j ′-th entry equal to 1, 1 ≤ j < j ′ ≤ k. For example, let us have q = 2,
ǫ = 1 and w = ABBAB as in Example 3. Then a(x1)b(x2)b(x3)a(x4)b(x5)
corresponds to (x1 + x3, x2 + x4, x3 + x5, x2, x5)A2B and we simply write ~γw →
a(1)b(2, 4)b(1, 3)a(2)b(3, 5) instead. Note that i, j and j ′ in a(i) and b(j, j ′) are
determined by the product of preceding generators.

3.1. Cayley digraphs

In the next lemma, for any element ApBl of the group Dk, k odd, p ∈
{1, 2, . . . , k} and l ∈ {0, 1}, we present a sequence of k generators (a word
in Dk) whose product is the element with suﬃx ApBl and the corresponding
matrix M has determinant ±1.

Lemma 11. Let q ≥ 1 be an integer and let k = 2q + 1. Then for every C in
Dk there is a word w in Dk such that V (w) = C and the ﬁber matrix M (w)
over the word w is a matrix with det(M ) = ±1.

Proof. All the elements of Dk are of the form ApBl, p ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k}, l ∈ {0, 1}
and we distinguish eight cases i), ii),. . . , viii), depending on the values of p and
l. In the ﬁrst four cases V (w) = Ap and in the last four cases V (w) = ApB.

Consider a column of M containing only one entry 1. If we remove the row and
column in which this entry appears, we obtain a new square matrix of degree
2q = k − 1 whose determinant is equal to ±det(M ). Since there are (p − 1)
generators a(i) in the expression (6), we have (p − 1) columns with the only
non-zero entry. All these (p − 1) non-zero entries are in diﬀerent rows. We
delete rows and columns which correspond to these non-zero entries to get a
new square matrix, say M ′, of degree 2q − p + 2. We have det(M ′) = ±det(M ).
Note that the new matrix M ′ contains the rows q + 1, p+ 1, p+ 2, . . . 2q + 1 of the
matrix M and the only generator which yields a column of M ′ with two entries
equal to 1 is b(q + 1, 2q + 1). The generator b(q + 1, 2q + 1) corresponds to the
last (2q − p + 2)-th column of M ′ and the (q + 1)-th row of M corresponds to
the ﬁrst row of M ′. Except for the ﬁrst row and the last column of M ′, every
row and every column of M ′ contains exactly one non-zero entry, which implies
that det(M ′) = ±1.

To give an example of this situation, let q = 5 and p = 6. Then k = 11,

Let us note that non-zero entries in the matrix M corresponding to the genera-
tors a(i) appear in the rows: 1, 2, . . . , q and p + q + 1, p + q + 2, . . . , 2q + 1. We
remove these rows from M together with columns corresponding to generators
a(i) to create a square matrix M ′ of order p, such that det(M ′) = ±det(M ).

For every generator b(j, j ′) appearing in the expression (7), j-th row does
not appear in M ′ and j ′-th row appears in M ′. It follows that each column of
M ′ contains exactly one non-zero entry. Since any two j ′-s are diﬀerent, each
row of M ′ contains exactly one non-zero entry as well. Hence det(M ′) = ±1.

We study the matrix M corresponding to this product of generators. We focus
on those entries 1 in the matrix M , which lie in columns corresponding to the
generators a(i). We again create a new matrix M ′ by removal of columns and
rows of M , in which these entries 1 appear to obtain a new square matrix of
degree 2q − p + 1. Note that we removed ﬁrst p rows of M .
It follows that
det(M ′) = ±det(M ). The matrix M ′ has exactly one non-zero entry in each
column and in each row, and so det(M ′) = ±1.

In the cases iv) - viii) we can obtain the matrices M and M ′ analogously as
in the cases i), ii) and iii). Note that in each case except for the ﬁrst one, the
matrix M ′ has exactly one non-zero entry in every row and in every column,
which implies that det(M ) = ±1.

Theorem 12. For every odd k ≥ 3 and for every even d ≥ 2 there exists a
Cayley digraph of order 2k( d

2 )k, degree d and diameter at most k.

Proof. Let H be an abelian group of order n ≥ 1 and let Γk = H k ⋊ϕ Dk. Let
G = Cay(Γk, X) be the Cayley digraph for the underlying group Γk and for
the generating set X = {a(x), b(x)|x ∈ H} introduced in Preliminaries. Since
|X| = 2n, the Cayley digraph G has degree d = 2n and the order of G is
2knk = 2k( d
2 )k. To show that G has diameter at most k it is suﬃcient to show
that every element of Γk is a product of at most k elements of X. Let C ∈ Dk.
By Lemma 11 for every C ∈ Dk there is a word w in Dk such that the ﬁber
matrix over w has determinant equal to ±1. By Lemma 9 the ﬁber over w
covers the element C = V (w) of Dk, that is every element of Γk with suﬃx C
is a product of k elements of X. Therefore the diameter of G is at most k.

Corollary 13. For any odd k ≥ 3 and for any d ≥ 2 there exists a Cayley

digraph of order 2k(cid:0)(cid:4) d

2(cid:5)(cid:1)k

, degree d and diameter at most k.

Proof. Adding one additional generator to the generating set X presented in
the proof of Theorem 12, cannot increase the diameter. Therefore we obtain a
Cayley digraph of degree d = 2n + 1, order 2knk = 2k( d−1
2 )k and diameter at
most k.

.

d ≥ 3k

2(cid:5)(cid:1)k
2k + 1. Then Cd,k ≥ 2k(cid:0)(cid:4) d
Proof. We show that for d ≥ 3k
2k + 1, the Cayley digraphs described in the proofs
of Theorem 12 and Corollary 13 have diameter k. The maximum order of a di-
graph of degree d and diameter ˜k ≤ k−1 is Md,k−1 = 1+d+d2 · · ·+dk−1 = dk

therefore it is suﬃcient to show that for d ≥ 3k

3.2. Bipartite Cayley digraphs

In the next lemma, for any element ApB (Ap+1) of the group Dk, k even,

p ∈ {1, 3, 5, . . . , k − 1}, we present a sequence of k generators (a word in Dk)

11

whose product is the element with suﬃx ApB (Ap+1) and with the corresponding
matrix M with determinant ±1.

Lemma 15. Let q ≥ 2 be an integer and let k = 2q. Then for every C ∈
{ApB, Ap+1|1 ≤ p ≤ k − 1, p odd }, C ∈ Dk, there is a word w in Dk such
that V (w) = C and the ﬁber matrix M (w) over the word w is a matrix with
det(M ) = ±1.

Proof. We distinguish four cases: i), ii) for C = Ap+1 and iii), iv) for C = ApB.
In the ﬁrst two cases we will use the notation p′ = p + 1, p′ even.

It can be checked that, in (14), non-zero entries of generators a(i) appear in
the rows 1, 2, . . . , p′. We remove from M rows and columns in which these non-
zero entries appear to obtain a new square matrix M ′ of degree 2q − p′, where
det(M ′) = ±det(M ). Columns of M ′ correspond to generators b(j, j ′). Note
that the j-th row of M does not appear in M ′, and the j ′-th row of M appears
in M ′. Hence M ′ has exactly one non-zero element in each row and in each
column, which implies that det(M ′) = ±1.

For the remaining cases we list the corresponding instances and then append

a note of how they can be handled.

2 )k′

= 2k′( d

Proof. Let k′ = k − 1, let n ≥ 1 be an integer, let H be an abelian group of
order n and let Γk′ = H k′
⋊ϕ Dk′ . Let G = Cay(Γk′ , X) be the Cayley digraph
for the underlying group Γk′ and for the generating set X = {a(x), b(x)|x ∈ H}
introduced in Preliminaries. Since |X| = 2n, the Cayley digraph has degree
d = 2n and the order of the Cayley digraph is 2k′nk′
. To show that
G has diameter at most k it is suﬃcient to show that every element of Γk′ is a
product of at most k elements of X. Let S = {ApB, Ap+1|1 ≤ p ≤ k′, p odd }
and let C ∈ S. By Lemma 15 for every C ∈ S there is a word w in Dk′ such
that the ﬁber matrix over w has determinant equal to ±1. By Lemma 9 the
ﬁber over w covers the element C = V (w) of S, that is every element of Γk′
with suﬃx C ∈ S is a product of k′ elements of X. Since generators from X
have suﬃces either A or B, no vertex with suﬃx Al is adjacent to the vertex
with suﬃx AmB if one of l, m is even and the other one is odd. Also no vertex
with suﬃx AlBi is adjacent to the vertex with suﬃx AmBi for i = 0 or 1, if
both, l, m are even, or if both l, m are odd. Therefore the Cayley digraph G is
bipartite. Note that in a bipartite Cayley digraph, if one can obtain any vertex
in one part as a product of k′ generators, then all vertices in the other part
can be obtained as products of (at most) k′ + 1 = k generators. Therefore the
diameter of G is at most k.

Corollary 17. For every odd k ≥ 5 and for every d ≥ 2 there exists a bipartite

Cayley digraph of order 2(k − 1)(cid:0)(cid:4) d

2(cid:5)(cid:1)k−1

, degree d and diameter at most k.

Proof. We add one additional generator with suﬃx A to the generating set X
given in the proof of Theorem 16 to obtain a Cayley digraph which is still
bipartite and has the diameter at most k. We thus obtain a bipartite Cayley
and

digraph of degree d = 2n + 1, order 2(k − 1)nk−1 = 2(k − 1)(cid:0)(cid:4) d

2(cid:5)(cid:1)k−1

diameter at most k.

Theorem 18 (Main theorem for bipartite Cayley digraphs). Let k ≥ 5 be odd
and let d ≥ 3k−1

k−1 + 1. Then BCd,k ≥ 2(k − 1)(cid:0)(cid:4) d

2(cid:5)(cid:1)k−1

.

Proof. Let d ≥ 3k−1
k−1 + 1. Let us prove that the bipartite Cayley digraphs
described in the proofs of Theorem 16 and Corollary 17 are of diameter k.
Since k is odd, the order of a bipartite digraph of diameter ˜k ≤ k − 1 cannot
exceed the bound MBd,k−1 = 2d(1 + d2 + d4 + · · · + dk−2) = 2d dk−1

it suﬃces to show that if d ≥ 3k−1

digraphs are greater than the Moore bound for bipartite digraphs of diameter

4. Conclusion

In this paper we construct the largest known Cayley digraphs of odd diameter
and large degree using semidirect products Γk = H k ⋊ϕ Dk. Simpler semidirect
products H k ⋊ϕ Zk have been used before. It would be interesting to consider
H k ⋊ϕ Pk for various subgroups Pk of Sym(k). The most diﬃcult part in this
research is often proving that the diameter of a Cayley digraph is exactly/at
most k.

Note that the product H k ⋊ϕ Sym(k) cannot be used to construct Cayley
digraphs C(H k ⋊ϕ Sym(k), X) of degree d and diameter k unless the genarating
set X is quite large (which would decrease the order of a Cayley digraph in
terms of d and k). For example if |X| = cn for some c > 0, then the order of
C(H k ⋊ϕ Sym(k), X) is k!nk = k! dk
ck . Since the order of a Cayley digraph of
degree d and diameter k cannot exceed the Moore bound 1 + d + d2 + · · · + dk,
it follows that for d → ∞ one must have k!

ck ≤ 1.

Let us also mention that all known construction of Cayley digraphs are very

far from the theoretical upper bound, leaving space for future research.
