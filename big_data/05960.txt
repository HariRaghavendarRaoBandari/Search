A resolution is proposed to the “solar abundance problem”, that is, the discrepancy between
helioseismological observations and the predictions of solar models, computed implementing state-
of-the-art photospheric abundances. We reassess the problem considering a newly determined set
of abundances, which indicate a lower limit to the metallicity of Z⊙ = 0.0196 ± 0.0014, signiﬁcantly
higher than ﬁndings during the past decade. Such value for the metallicity is determined in situ,
measuring the least fractionated solar winds over the poles of the Sun, rather than spectroscop-
ically. We determine the response of helioseismological observables to the corresponding changes
in elemental abundances. Our ﬁndings indicate that, taking inversion errors into account, good
agreement between models and observations is achieved. The deﬁnitive test for these abundances
will be measurements of the CNO neutrino ﬂuxes by SNO+ (which we expect to be ∼ 30-50% higher
than predictions using abundances based on photospheric spectroscopy). We brieﬂy comment on
the implausibility of previously proposed solutions based on dark matter. The results also imply
that 3D spectroscopic inversion processes systematically underestimate elemental abundances in the
photosphere. Our conclusion is that the solar abundance problem has found a deﬁnitive compelling
solution.

Introduction.–Among the most important diagnos-
tics of the evolutionary history of the Sun is its metal-
licity Z⊙, deﬁned as the fraction of the solar mass re-
siding in elements heavier than He. In the standard so-
lar model (SSM), absolute and relative elemental abun-
dances are treated as inputs, from which observables to
be compared with helioseismological inferences are ob-
tained. Up to 1998, heavy element mixtures provided by
Anders & Grevesse (AG89, Z⊙ = 0.0202) [1], and subse-
quently by Grevesse & Sauval (GS98, Z⊙ = 0.0170) [2]
yielded acceptable concordance between model and data.
In recent years, however, an important dilemma known
as the “solar abundance problem” has emerged. A sys-
tematic reassessment of solar model atmospheres has led
to a downward revision of the photospheric abundances
of heavy elements (e.g.
[3–8]). Particularly noteworthy
are the revisions known as AGS05 [9] and AGSS09 [10],
which yield Z⊙ = 0.0122 and 0.0133 respectively. These
revisions rely on novel 3D inversion models for the inver-
sion of spectroscopic data to photospheric abundances
replacing the previous status quo of 1D or 2D models.

The eﬀect of such revisions has been that of spoiling
the otherwise good agreement between solar models and
results from helioseismology [11–17]. For instance, the
sound speed u(r) is inferred to be ∼ 1% lower than pre-
dicted at the bottom of the convective envelope (amount-
ing to a discrepancy of ∼ 10σ). Similarly, the surface He
abundance Ys and convective zone boundary (CZB) Rb
are ∼ 7% lower and ∼ 1.5% higher than those deduced
from helioseismology, corresponding to ∼ 6σ and ∼ 15σ
discrepancies respectively [18]. Various solutions to the

problem have been proposed, ranging from an anoma-
lously large Ne abundance in the photosphere [19], phys-
ical processes not accounted for in the SSM (e.g. [20–29]),
incorrectly estimated opacity [30, 31], to axion-like par-
ticles [32] and exotic energy transport due to captured
dark matter (DM) [33–39]. However, none of these solu-
tions appears compelling (e.g.
[40]). It is resolving the
discrepancies in the three observables Ys, Rb, and u(r)
that we shall focus on in our work.

In this Letter, we investigate a simple solution to the
SSM problems, our assertion being that novel photo-
spheric abundances have been incorrectly inferred. This
approach is motivated by a completely diﬀerent method-
ology to estimate photospheric abundances, based on in
situ measurements of heavy ions in the least fractionated
solar wind. Adopting the latest set of abundances thus
determined, we assess the eﬀect of the new elemental
abundances on helioseismological observables. We do so
by using the Linear solar model formalism [41], which al-
lows us to determine the response of the Sun to arbitrary
modiﬁcations of input parameters. Using this methodol-
ogy we explore the consistency of these new abundance
measurements with constraints from helioseismology.

In situ metallicity determination.–We here com-
pare new in situ estimates of the solar metallicity with
those that rely on photospheric spectroscopy. The lat-
ter technique has found broad use within the commu-
nity. Yet the interpretation of observations using pho-
tospheric spectroscopy is anything but straightforward.
It requires sophisticated inversion techniques that take
into the account radiative transport, three-dimensional

structure and hydrodynamic models of the observation
volumes, along with departures from local thermal equi-
librium. In addition, the methodology also relies on de-
tailed knowledge of the relevant atomic and molecular
transition probabilities [5, 10].

Alternatively, metallicity can be inferred from in situ
collection of solar samples. Whereas these techniques do
not suﬀer from the aforementioned technical diﬃculties,
they are in general subject to diﬀerent challenges, such
as fractionation processes that tend to enrich or deplete
ions based on their ionization and transport histories.
Processes known to be at work are collisional coupling,
especially for He, First Ionization Potential (FIP) frac-
tionation processes presumably operating in the low solar
atmosphere, and gravitational settling [42, 43].

However, it has been shown and recently conﬁrmed
that most if not all of these processes are either absent
or signiﬁcantly reduced in solar wind emerging from polar
regions near solar minimum, out of polar coronal holes
(PCHs) [44, 45]. The most signiﬁcant residual fraction-
ation eﬀect in this wind is that of insuﬃcient collisional
coupling that aﬀects all of solar wind, but is most evi-
dent in He/H [42]. Furthermore, it was shown that the
composition of these PCHs is constant during the entire
Ulysses mission [46], which explored these regions dur-
ing its mission from 1990 to 2009. The only observed
residual changes relate to small changes of the ionization
state, reﬂecting the temperature and acceleration history
of the solar wind emerging from PCHs. The elemental
composition remains constant within the error bars of
this methodology [47, 48].

It follows that the sample collected from PCHs pro-
vides a direct measurement of the photospheric compo-
sition with one caveat:
[49] (which we will refer to as
vSZ16 henceforth) cannot exclude a small residual frac-
tionation in these regions. However, based on the phys-
ical processes and a systematic study of various source
regions, they concluded that such processes systemati-
cally decrease the overall solar metallicity. The in situ
measured Z⊙ value therefore constitutes a lower limit on
the photospheric Z⊙, allowing for a consistency check
of the values determined via photospheric spectroscopy
and also constraints from helioseismology. In our anal-
ysis we choose to restrict ourselves to the PCH abun-
dances provided by vSZ16 because it has been conclu-
sively shown to be most similar to the photosphere, in
contrast to low-latitude solar wind which is more prone
to fractionation [49–51]. The data are provided by the
Ulysses mission, and particularly by its “Solar Wind Ion
Composition Spectrometer” (SWICS) [52].

The derived metallicity is Z⊙ = 0.0196 ± 0.0014, a ﬁg-
ure which is signiﬁcantly larger than those of the AGS05
[9] and AGSS09 [10] catalogues, and intermediate be-
tween the AG89 [1] and GS98 [2] ones. Although one
might be tempted to jump to the hasty conclusion that
this revised value automatically restores agreement be-

2

tween models and helioseismology, care must be taken.
The details of such statement crucially depend on the
exact variation of the abundances of individual metals in
our Sun, since diﬀerent metals aﬀect the radiative opacity
of the solar mixture (and thereby the response of helio-
seismological observables) in a diﬀerent way.
In other
words, the total metallicity does not uniquely determine
the response of the Sun because it is degenerate with the
individual metal abundances (the same change in the to-
tal metallicity can be obtained by varying the abundances
of distinct elements diﬀerently).

Linear solar model.–To investigate the impact of
varying input parameters (such as individual elemental
abundances) on helioseismological observables we need
to be able to quantify the response of the Sun to ar-
bitrary variations of these parameters. We exploit the
recently developed Linear solar model (LSM hereafter)
approach [18, 41]. Herein, the solar structure equations
are linearized, resulting in a set of ordinary diﬀerential
equations for the fractional variations of the thermody-
namic quantities describing the Sun. The LSM has been
shown to reproduce the predictions of full nonlinear evo-
lutionary codes to a high level of accuracy [41].

The eﬀect of varying the metallicity of the Sun is to
modify its radiative opacity proﬁle, κ(r). This, in turn, is
a key quantity that describes the coupling between radi-
ation and matter in the hot dense interior of the Sun. It
plays a pivotal role in the determination of helioseismo-
logical observables. Leaving aside intrinsic opacity vari-
ations (that is, opacity variations with a ﬁxed compo-
sition), the fractional opacity variation we will be con-
cerned with is the composition opacity variation δκZ (r),
driven by a change in elemental abundances. Thus we
can express the fractional opacity variation as [53]:

δκ(r) ≈ δκZ (r) ≃ Xj

∂ ln κ(r)
∂ ln Zj

δZj ≡ Xj

κZj δZj .

(1)

In Eq.(1), the sum runs over the eight metals which con-
tribute to ∼ 98% of the Sun’s metallicity: C, N, O, Ne,
Mg, Si, S, and Fe. For each of these metals, δZj repre-
sents the fractional change in abundance with respect a
chosen baseline set of abundances (which we take to be
those the AGSS09 catalogue).

The logarithmic derivatives κZj are given in [53], and
plotted in Figure 1. In Table I we list the elemental abun-
dances ǫi of these eight metals in the AGSS09 and vSZ16
catalogues. The fractional variation in abundance for a
given element i is determined as:

δZi = 10(ǫAGSS09,i−ǫvSZ16 ,i) − 1

(2)

For all elements other than Ne, the new element abun-
dances obtained from in situ vSZ16 measurements are
signiﬁcantly higher. In particular, for Si and S, the frac-
tional increase is >∼100%. We note that [54] estimate sys-
tematic errors at most ∼ 20% for the vSZ16 catalogue.

FIG. 2: Fractional variation in opacity δκ(r) when going from

The fractional opacity variation, δκ(r), allows us to
estimate the response of helioseismological observables

to variations in the metallicity content of the Sun. For
δκ(r) <∼ 1, the response of the Sun is linear. Thus the
variation of a generic given quantity δQ ≡ Q/Q − 1
(where Q is the SSM value for Q) can be related to the
opacity variation κ(r) through a kernel KQ(r) as:

δQ = Z dr KQ(r)δκ(r) .

(3)

Here the kernel KQ(r) corresponds to the functional
derivative of Q with respect to the opacity, and quantiﬁes
the sensitivity of the given quantity to opacity variations
in diﬀerent zones of the Sun.

The kernels for surface He abundance and CZB, KY (r)
and KR(r), have been worked out in [18] and are plot-
ted in Figures 3 and 4. The functional derivatives of

the sound speed proﬁle (at a given r′) with respect to

a few r′s. However, for our purposes it is more immedi-
ate to use the logarithmic derivatives of the sound speed
with respect to the elemental abundances. These have
been calculated in [53] using the LSM formalism and are
plotted in Figure 5. Similarly to the case with opacity

Results.–Using the previously discussed approach, we
evaluate the response of the three helioseismological ob-
servables of interest: surface He abundance Ys, CZB Rb,
and sound speed u(r) (particularly at the bottom of the
convective envelope). We begin by considering the frac-
tional sound speed variation δu, gauged using Eq.(4).
The result is shown in Figure 6, where we also plot 1σ and
2σ error bands on δu, obtained by propagating the uncer-
tainties on δZj. The obtained reponse δu is to be com-
pared with the thick solid line in the ﬁgure: this repre-
sents the fractional diﬀerence between the AGSS09 radial
sound speed proﬁle and the one inferred from helioseis-
mology (see e.g. [37]). It thus amounts to the fractional
variation required to bring the AGSS09 sound speed in
agreement with helioseismological inferences. Hencefor-
ward we will refer to this proﬁle as δuth.

To complete the analysis of the sound speed response
δu(r), we include uncertainties on δuth(r) (thick solid
line in Figure 6). By far the largest source of uncer-
tainty is the one coming from helioseismological inversion
[55–57], and [55] ﬁrst discussed two diﬀerent approaches
to estimating such uncertainties. The ﬁrst is the “sta-
tistical ” approach, wherein it is assumed that diﬀerent
contributions to the total uncertainty partially compen-
sate each other and are added in quadrature. This ap-
proach is most justiﬁed when the partial uncertainties
essentially all correspond to statistical uncertainties in
the measured frequencies of solar p-modes. A second
approach, denoted as “conservative”, adds up partial
uncertainties linearly, and results in a total uncertainty
which is larger than the statistical one by a factor of
∼2-3. This approach is best suited when one has reason
to believe that the main helioseismological uncertainties

are of systematic nature, e.g. related to residual model-
dependence (treatment of opacities, equation of state,
diﬀusion) and/or inversion method. The authors of [55]
argue that the conservative approach actually provides
the best estimate of the uncertainty. For r/R⊙ <∼ 0.1 the
helioseismology uncertainty is quite large, reﬂecting the
fact that the reconstructed sound speed in this region is
highly uncertain due to the low number of low-l p modes
reaching the most inner regions our Sun.

FIG. 7: Diﬀerence between δu(r) and δuth(r), to be compared
with dashed line at ∆δu = 0. CZB located at r/R⊙ ≃ 0.73.

Including helioseismological uncertainties yields the re-
sults shown in Figure 7, where we plot the diﬀerence
∆δu(r) ≡ δu(r) − δuth(r). Being statistically indepen-
dent, we add helioseismology uncertainties in quadrature
with those propagated from uncertainties in the vSZ16

abundances. With helioseismological uncertainties cor-
rectly taken into account, we visually see that the agree-
ment between δu(r) and δuth(r) is very good. We con-
struct a ﬁgure which puts the degree of compatibility
on a more quantitative footing by averaging the quantity
χ(r) ≡ ∆δu(r)/σ(r) over the solar interior, σ(r) denoting
the 1σ uncertainty on ∆δu(r) (blue band in Figure 7).
We ﬁnd that, adopting this measure, δu(r) and δuth(r)
are compatible within ∼ 1.4σ [∼ 0.6σ] when adopting
statistical [conservative] uncertainties. In particular, at
the CZB (where disagreement between previous models
and helioseismology was most severe), the discrepancy is
reduced to as little as ∼ 0.35σ [∼ 0.1σ] when using the
statistical [conservative] approach. Above the CZB, the
disagreement between model and helioseismology essen-
tially disappears because the temperature gradient be-
comes adiabatic (consequently breaking hydrostatic equi-
librium and causing convection to set in), and u(r) de-
pends no longer on the composition of the Sun.

Next, we compute the response of the surface He abun-
dance using Eq.(3). For Ys, the SSM prediction is Ys =
0.2356 (±0.0035 from modeling uncertainty), whereas the
helioseismology value is Ys = 0.2485 ± 0.0034 (see e.g.
[38]). Thus the (absolute) variation required to restore
agreement is ∆Ys,th ≃ 0.0129 ± 0.0049. Using Eq.(3),
the kernel KY (r) shown in Figure 3 and the opacity pro-
ﬁle δκ(r) shown in Figure 2, we ﬁnd ∆Ys ≃ 0.04 ± 0.02.
Although the central value is in slight tension with that
of ∆Ys,th, the involved errors are quite large and taking
them into account the two are consistent within ∼ 1.3σ.
Finally, we repeat the same analysis for the CZB. The
SSM prediction Rb/R⊙ ≃ 0.722 (±0.004 from modeling
uncertainty) is in tension with the helioseismology value
of Rb/R⊙ = 0.713 ± 0.001, the required fractional varia-
tion to restore agreement being δRb,th ≃ −0.012 ± 0.005.
For the vSZ16 abundances we ﬁnd δRb ≃ −0.008 ± 0.004,
which is consistent with δRb,th within ∼ 0.6σ. Our main
results are summarized in Table II.

Discussion.–We have reassessed the solar abundance
problem in the light of new in situ-determined metal
abundances, ﬁnding that these restore the agreement
between models and helioseismology. The value of
the metallicity determined is signiﬁcantly higher than
the ﬁndings of other groups based on photospheric
spectroscopy. Moreover, since in situ determinations

5

actually provide a lower bound to the true value of
the metallicity (due to possible residual fractionation),
this suggests that previous determinations considerably
underestimated the metallicity of our Sun.
Individual
element abundances change signiﬁcantly with respect
to previous ﬁndings as shown in Table I (e.g. Si and S
increase by >∼ 100%). Using these new measurements
of solar composition, we studied the response of helio-
seismological observables and present our main ﬁndings
in Table II, which shows that the disagreement between
previous models and helioseismology is considerably
alleviated.

It is beyond the scope of this analysis to address
the speciﬁc problems of the spectroscopic methodology,
which has determined a smaller metallicity and is in-
consistent with helioseismology. There are nonetheless a
number of these shortcomings which are being addressed
in improved modern photospheric spectroscopy models
currently being developed (e.g. [5]): these include num-
ber of required opacity bins used and weight assigned
to various lines, and that radiative transfer calculations
most likely do not adequately estimate the impact of
blending lines.

Recently proposed solutions to the problem based
on exotic energy transport by captured DM are also
severely disfavored. While this type of non-local energy
transport can mildly ameliorate the discrepancy for
u(r) and Rb, this occurs at the expense of worsening
the disagreement with Ys (which decreases as a result
of core cooling, to which the Sun responds increasing
its Hydrogen fraction) and lowering the neutrino ﬂuxes
beyond what is allowed by current measurements (e.g.
[58]). These and other issues will be discussed in more
detail in a forthcoming work [59].

An independent observational constraint for these
abundances resides in upcoming measurements of the
CNO neutrino ﬂuxes by SNO+ [60], which can lift the
basic degeneracy between intrinsic and composition
opacity variation [61, 62]. If the vSZ16 abundances are
correct, such ﬂuxes should be ≃30-50% greater than
reference predictions. These enhanced values are allowed
by the existing rough upper limits from Borexino [63].
Similarly, we estimate a milder ≈10% increase in the
7Be and 8B neutrino ﬂuxes. This can mitigate the
slight disagreement between AGSS09 abundances and
measurements of these ﬂuxes from Borexino [64, 65],
with the former predicting ﬂuxes which are ≃10% lower
than observed (see e.g. Table 2 in [53]).

The possibility of conﬁrming or disfavoring the revised
abundances presented here is well within reach. Should
our picture be conﬁrmed, we will truly be able to claim
that the solar abundance problem has been solved.
