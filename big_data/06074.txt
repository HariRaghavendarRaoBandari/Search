The quantum spin Hall eﬀect has been predicted theoretically and observed experimentally in
InAs/GaSb quantum wells as a result of inverted band structures, for which electron bands in
InAs layers are below heavy hole bands in GaSb layers in energy. The hybridization between
electron bands and heavy hole bands leads to a hybridization gap away from k=0. A recent puzzling
observation in experiments is that when the system is tuned to more inverted regime by a gate voltage
(a larger inverted gap at k=0), the hybridization gap decreases. Motivated by this experiment, we
explore the dependence of hybridization gap as a function of external electric ﬁelds based on the
eight-band Kane model. We identify two regimes when varying electric ﬁelds: (1) both inverted
and hybridization gaps increase and (2) inverted gap increases while hybridization gap decreases.
Based on the eﬀective model, we ﬁnd that light-hole bands in GaSb layers play an important role
in determining hybridization gap. In addition, a large external electric ﬁeld can induce a strong
Rashba splitting and also inﬂuence hybridization gap.

Two dimensional quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator
[1–4] has an insulating band gap and conducting heli-
cal edge channels at the boundary, which consist of two
counter-propagating one dimensional edge modes with
opposite spin. The helical edge modes (HEMs) are pro-
tected by time reversal symmetry and characterized by a
Z2 topological invariant. The ﬁrst experiment evidence of
the QSH eﬀect was identiﬁed in transport measurements
of HgTe/CdTe quantum wells [4], for which a 2e2/h con-
ductance was observed in a two-terminal measurement
when the Fermi energy is tuned into the bulk energy
gap. Recently, increasing interests were attracted to an-
other QSH insulator, the type II InAs/GaSb quantum
wells [5–8], because a more robust 2e2/h conductance
plateau, which surprisingly persists up to 10T for an in-
plane magnetic ﬁeld [8], was found in this system. More
recent experiments also revealed strong interaction eﬀect
of HEMs (helical Luttinger liquids) [9], presumably due
to the small Fermi velocity in this system. In addition,
a strong superconducting proximity eﬀect between InAs
and superconductors [10] provides an interesting plat-
form for the study of topological superconductivity and
Majorana zero modes in this system.

Recent experiments[11] by Du’s group on this system
have revealed a puzzling eﬀect about the dependence of
band gap on external gate voltages. To illustrate this
puzzling eﬀect, we ﬁrst review electronic band structure
of InAs/GaSb quantum wells.

The band diagram of AlSb/InAs/GaSb/AlSb QWs is
shown in Fig.1(a), in which the conduction band mini-
mum of InAs layer is 0.15 eV lower in energy than the
valence maximum band of GaSb layer, leading to an in-
verted band structure. As a consequence, there is an
anti-crossing between the electron sub-band in the InAs
layers, denoted as |E0i, and the heavy-hole sub-band in

the GaSb layers, denoted as |HH0i, due to hybridiza-
tion between them. The anti-crossing energy dispersion
is shown in Fig.1(c), in which the band gap at Γ (k = 0)
is usually known as the inverted band gap, denoted as
Eg = 2M , while the small gap at a ﬁnite momentum k,
labeled by ∆, is known as hybridization gap or mini-gap.
The low energy physics for the |E0i and |HH0i sub-bands
can be captured by a simple four band model [3], which
is the standard model to understand the QSH physics in
this system.

The recent transport measurement [11] revealed the
relation between the inverted gap M and mini-gap ∆ by
independently controlling chemical potentials and asym-
metric potentials in an experimental setup with front and
back gate voltages, as shown in Fig.1(a). In their experi-
ment, they ﬁx the back gate voltage and tune front gate
voltage continuously to reach a charge neutrality point
(CNP), which corresponds to the point with equal elec-
tron and hole density (n0 = p0) and can be dictated by
sign change of the Hall resistance. By ﬁtting the Hall re-
sistance to a two-carrier model [12], carrier densities and
mobilities for both electrons and holes can be extracted.
By tuning back gate voltage, it is shown that electron
density n0 at CNP can reduce from 9 × 1010 cm−2 to
5 × 1010 cm−2, implying that the inverted band gap Eg
is also reduced. Moreover, the measurement of longi-
tudinal conductance σxx in a double-gated Corbino de-
vice as a function of temperature reveals an excitation
gap for diﬀerent carrier density n0 at CNP. The mini-
gap ∆ can be extracted by ﬁtting the temperature de-
pendence of longitudinal resistance with the equation
σxx ≈ exp (−∆/2kBT ). Surprisingly, it is found that the
mini-gap ∆ increases from 0.5 meV to 3 meV (5K to 30K)
as n0 decreases from 9× 1010 cm−2 to 5× 1010 cm−2. As
the electron density n0 at CNP is further reduced below
5 × 1010 cm−2), the mini-gap ∆ is reduced.

To get more insight of Du’s experiment, we ﬁrst con-
sider the relation between electron density at CNP and
mini-gap ∆ in the four band model described in Ref.
[3] and [5]. The CNP is determined by the momentum
kc = q M
B of the anti-crossing point between |E0i and
|HH0i, where M is inversion gap and B is the coeﬃ-
cient before quadratic terms. The electron density at the
CNP is related to kc by n0 = k2
2πB , from which one
can see that n0 is directly proportional to inversion gap
M . On the other hand, the mini-gap ∆ is also related to
kc by ∆ = Akc = Aq M
B . As a result, we expect that
the mini-gap should be proportional to √n0 in the four
band model, and this simple analysis is clearly in contra-
diction to the experimental observation described above.
Thus, a study beyond the four band model is required to
understand this experimental observation.

In order to explore the dependence of the inversion gap
and the mini-gap on external electric ﬁelds, we perform a

2

numerical calculation of electronic band structures with
external electric ﬁelds. Our starting point is the eight-
band Kane Hamiltonian HK derived at Γ point in the
framework of k · p theory[13], together with an external
electric ﬁeld term. The full Hamiltonian is given by

Hfull = HK + Vext
Vext =(cid:20)(cid:18) U

L(cid:19) eV · ˚A−1(cid:21) (z ˚A).

(2)

The eight-band Kane Hamiltonian HK [14, 15] is writ-
ten in the basis |λi(λ = 1, 2,··· , 8), labelling 2 s-orbital
bands and 6 p-orbital bands.
|λ = 1i and |2i are for
two s-orbital bands |Γ6,±1/2i, |3i and |6i are for high
hole bands |Γ8,±3/2i; |4i and |5i are for light hole bands
|Γ8,±1/2i; and |7i and |8i are for |Γ7,±1/2i. The struc-
ture parameters for InAs, GaSb and AlSb at T = 0K
are listed in Table I of Appendix I in the supplementary
materials. In Eq. (1), Vext denotes the external electric
potential, U is the potential drop and L = d1 +d2 +2d3 is
the total width of the QWs, and d1, d2, d3 are the widths
of GaSb, InAs and AlSb layers, respectively, as shown in
Fig.1. For the quantum well problem, we need to solve
the following eigen-equation

expanded
numerically in terms of the plane waves. The detailed
technique information is included in Appendex I and II.
Our main numerical results are summarized in Fig. 2.
In Fig. 2(a) and (b), we show two typical energy dis-
persions for the potentials U = 0 eV and U = 0.2 eV,
respectively. The system is in the inverted regime for
both potentials, where |E0i state is below |HH0i state
in energy. A mini-gap ∆ occurs around the momentum
k = 0.0125 ˚A−1
for
U = 0.2 eV. All energy bands are spin split by Rashba
spin-orbit coupling, due to the lack of inversion symme-
try. With increasing the potential U (positive electric
ﬁeld), one can see that the system is driven into more in-
verted regime with a larger inverted gap from 15 meV
to 30 meV. Rashba spin splitting is also signiﬁcantly
enhanced for both conduction and valence bands. An-
other important feature is that with a large potential,
the |LH1i state also move closer to the band gap and
show a strong mixing with |E0i state. These features
can be understood from a simple physical picture shown
in Fig. 1(b). In a positive electric ﬁeld, the energies in
both the heavy hole (|HH0i) and light hole (|LH1i) va-
lence bands in GaSb layer increases, while the energy in
the conduction band of InAs layer (|E0i) decreases. As a
consequence, the inverted band gap Eg is increased, while
the light hole band is pushed toward the Fermi energy.

In Fig. 2(c), we plot the inverted band gap Eg and

mini-gap ∆ as functions of external potential U , which
behave very diﬀerently. Eg increases monotonically as
U increases, while ∆ has a maximum at U = 0 and de-
creases as |U| increases, for both positive and negative
U. The relationship between ∆ and Eg is summarized
in Fig.2(d), from which one can see that the mini-gap
∆ decreases from 3 meV to 0.5 meV while the inverted
gap Eg increases from 15meV to 30meV when the ex-

3

ternal electric potential U is tuned from 0eV to 0.3eV.
In Du’s experiment [11], the excitation gap, which is
measured from temperature dependence of longitudinal
conductance, also decreases from 3meV to 0.5meV when
electron density n0 at the CNP increases by around two
times. Since n0 = M
2πB is directly proportional to the
inverted gap Eg = 2M , we conclude that our calcula-
tions are consistent with experimental observations. We
may estimate n0 in our model, n0 = 2.15× 1011 cm−2 for
electric potential U = 0 eV ; and n0 = 6.06 × 1011 cm−2
for U = 0.2 eV . This estimation for n0 diﬀers from the
values in the experiment[11] and this is because our quan-
tum well conﬁguration is not exactly the same as that in
experiments. However, the qualitative change tendency
for n0 and ∆, Eg is consistent with experiments.

To provide more theoretical insight to the underly-
ing physics, we next study the four band model for
InAs/GaSb QWs. A key insight is that by tuning ex-
ternal electric ﬁelds, not only the inverted band gap M
is modiﬁed, but also other parameters, such as A and
ξe, be changed. Therefore, we adopt the perturbation
theory [15] to derive all the parameters in the four-band
model from the eight-band Kane model [16]. We treat
Hfull(kz, kx = 0, ky = 0) including electric ﬁelds in Eq.(1)
as non-perturbation Hamiltonian and solve the eigen en-
ergies and eigen wave functions at Γ point. All the other
terms including non-zero kx, ky are regarded as the per-
turbation part of the Hamiltonian. Up to the ﬁrst order
in the momentum k, we ﬁnd that A and ξe near Γ point
can be given by

A = −

function is expanded as |fαi = Pλ fα,λ(z)|λi and
the inner product is deﬁned as hfα,λ|V (z)|fα′,λ′i =
R dzf∗α,λ(z)V (z)fα′,λ′(z) for any function V (z). From
Eq. (4) and (5), one can directly compute parameters
A and ξe as functions of the electric potential U . The
results are summarized in Fig. 3(a). The parameter A
decreases from 0.367 eV·˚A to 0.034 eV·˚A as U increases
from 0 eV to 0.2 eV, then saturates as U further in-
creases. On the other hand, ξe monotonically increases
and changes its sign from negative to positive at U ≈ 0.1

eV, which may be attributed to the opposite contribution
to the Rashba coupling under the positive electric poten-
tial U , as compared to the Rashba coupling from intrinsic
structure asymmetry of our quantum well structure. As
we shall analyse below, the decrease of the mini-gap ∆
as U changes from 0 eV to 0.2 eV is mainly due to the
rapid drop of A, and the decrease of ∆ as U increases
beyond 0.2 eV is due to the rapid increase of ξe.

We ﬁrst consider the region 0 eV < U < 0.2 eV. Since

∆ = ApM/B, while M increases as U increases, A
decreases more rapidly and plays an important role to
lead the reduction of ∆. More quantitatively, we ﬁnd
A(U=0.2) ∼ 11 and M(U=0)
A(U=0)
M(U=0.2) ∼ 0.6, leading to a change
of mini-gap ∆(U=0)
∆(U=0.2) ∼ 8. This estimate explains why

4

calculations show that the contribution to A from the
term hfE+,1|P|fH+,3i is about ten times larger than that
from the term hfE+,4|{γ′3, kz} + [kz, κ]|fH+,3i. Thus, the
rapid decrease of fE0,1 leads to the drop of the parameter
A as U increases from 0.

Now let us brieﬂy consider the region −0.15 eV < U <
0 eV. In this region, we attribute the decrease of mini-gap
∆ in Fig.2(c) to the rapid drop of the inverted gap M . In
this region, it turns out that the changes of A and ξe are
not signiﬁcant ( A(U=−0.15)
ξe(U=0) = 1.4),
while the inverted gap decreases greatly M(U=−0.15)
M(U=0) =
0.04, leading to a reduction of mini-gap ∆ ( ∆(U=−0.15)
∆(U=0) =
0.32).

A(U=0) = 1.6 and ξe(U=−0.15)

Conclusions and discussions- In summary, electric ﬁeld
dependences of the mini-gap and inverted gap are care-
fully studied for InAs/GaSb QWs based on the four band
model and more sophisticated Kane model. Our results
show opposite behaviors of the mini-gap and the inverted
gap in certain parameter region, which provides a pos-
sible explanation of the puzzling observations in recent
experiments of this system [11, 17]. We also notice re-
cent debates about the origin of the quantized conduc-
tance plateau and the observation of edge transport in
the trivial insulator side [18], as well as the identiﬁcation
of inverted or normal band gap [17, 19]. In particular,
the behaviors of mini-gap ∆ under an in-plane magnetic
ﬁeld are still not well understood [11, 17, 19]. We hope
our calculations can shed light on the underlying physics
behind these controversial experimental observations.

mini-gap ∆ decreases even though the inversion gap Eg
increases in the region 0 eV < U < 0.2 eV in Fig.2(c).

We next consider the region 0.2 eV < U < 0.3 eV, in
which the parameter A remains almost unchanged hence
does not play much role to the change of the minigap as
we can see from Fig. 3(c). On the other hand, the Rashba
term ξe becomes more important in this region. Due to
the intrinsic structure asymmetry of InAs/GaSb QWs,
there is a non-zero Rashba coupling at U = 0, which is
negative in the present convention. A positive electric
potential U gives rise to a Rashba coeﬃcient of opposite
sign, so that the net Rashba coeﬃcient ξe increases and
becomes positive at U > 0.1 eV. In Fig. 3(b), we plot ∆
vs Eg for three values of ξe. Clearly, ∆ also depends on
ξ0. Thus, we attribute the reduction of ∆ in the region
U > 0.2 eV to the increased value of ξe.

Let us return to the dependence of the parameter A on
the external electric potential U . This can be understood
from the composition of the eigen wave function |E0i, as
shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d). As we can see from Fig.
1(b), the light hole sub-band |LH1i moves close to the
electron sub-band |E0i as U increases from zero. As a
consequence, there is a strong hybridization between the
2i and |Γ8,± 1
components |Γ6,± 1
2i. In particular, we ﬁnd
at U = 0.2 eV, the eigen state |E0, +i mainly consists of
the components |Γ8, 1
2i (fE0+,4), in sharp contrast to the
case of U = 0, where |Γ6, 1
2i (fE0+,1) is the dominant
component. From Eq. (4), both fE0,1 and fE0,4 terms
may contribute to the parameter A. However, numerical

APPENDIX I: EIGHT-BAND KANE MODEL AND METHOD

This QW system can be well described by the 8-band Kane model[20] at Γ point in the framework of k · p theory,

and we choose the usual bulk basis[14, 15] as

|1i = |Γ6, 1/2i = |Si| ↑i
|2i = |Γ6,−1/2i = |Si| ↓i
1
|3i = |Γ8, 3/2i =
√2|X + iY i| ↑i

|4i = |Γ8, 1/2i =

|6i = |Γ8,−3/2i = −

|8i = |Γ7,−1/2i =

(−|Zi| ↓i + |X − iY i| ↑i)

(2|Zi| ↓i + |X − iY i| ↑i)

where we use the standard notation with |Γ6,±1/2i representing an s-like conduction band, |Γ8,±1/2i a p-like light
hole band and |Γ8,±3/2i a p-like heavy hole band in zinc blende crystal structure[15]. The SO split-oﬀ bands
|Γ7,±1/2i are far away in energy from the other bands, which will still be considered and kept in the calculation
of electronic band structure; However, these two bands are not important at all and will be omitted to derive the
eﬀective 4-band BHZ model. Now, we would introduce our starting points, i.e., the 8-band Kane Hamiltonian HK,
which is described anywhere, such as in Ref.[21–23]. In the above basis set |λi(λ = 1, 2,··· , 8), the hamiltonian HK
for two-dimensional system with [001] growth direction takes the following form:

[A, B] = AB − BA is the usual commutator and {A, B} = AB + BA is the usual anticommutator for the operators
A and B; P is the Kane momentum matrix element, and will be signed with a numerical value; Ec(z) and Ev(z) are
the conduction and valence band edges, respectively; γ1, γ2, γ3, κ, and F represents the coupling to the remote bands,
and the µ and ¯γ are deﬁned as µ = (γ3 − γ2)/2 and ¯γ = (γ3 + γ2)/2; ∆ is the spin-orbit splitting energy. The band
structure parameters for InAs, GaSb and AlSb separately at T = 0K are listed in Table I.

Then, we would like to solve the 1D eigenvalues problem of Hamiltonian in Eq.(9) along z direction, since both kx

and ky are good quantum number. Given (kx, ky), we only need to solve this equation (kz → −i∂z)

Hfull(kz) ~f (z) = E ~f (z)

(9)

where ~f (z) is the z direction envelope function vector (f1(z), f2(z),··· , f8(z))T , the corresponded eigenvectors with
eigenvalues Eµ can be expanded in the basis |λi as

|Eµi =

Xλ=1

f µ
λ (z)|λi

Recall that |λi are the eight basis for Kane model. And, we take plane-wave expansion to get the envelope functions

functions,

L n, n = 0,±1,±2,··· . Therefore, we just need diagonalize a matrix to get the coeﬃcients for envelope

where we would like to take a cutoﬀ for the total number of plane wave we picked in the diagonalization, n ≤ Ncut.
In practice, Ncut = 40 is enough to get the low energy dispersion. The electronic properties of such systems depend

APPENDIX II: CRITICAL WIDTH FOR INAS/GASB QUANTUM WELLS

We focus on the critical quantum well thickness[22] to ﬁnd that the lowest subbands(InAs, denoted as |E0i) is crossed
with the lowest subbands (GaSb, denoted as |HH0i), see Fig.4(a)(b). Therefore, we will choose d1 = d2 = 100 ˚A and
d3 = 250 ˚A to numerical calculation in the main text, where we discuss the hybridized mini-gap ∆ as a function of
the external electric potential U .

for GaSb by ﬁxing the width of InAs(9 nm) and AlSb(25 nm).

APPENDIX III: INTERFACE ELECTRIC FIELD

We would like to consider the eﬀect of external electric ﬁeld and interface electric ﬁeld, the whole Hamiltonian reads

Hfull = HK + Vext + Vint
Vext =(cid:20)(cid:18) U
Vint =(h(cid:16) U ′

L(cid:19) eV · ˚A−1(cid:21) (z ˚A)
2d4(cid:17) eV · ˚A−1i (z ˚A) − d4 ≤ z ≤ d4

0

otherwise

(13)

(14)

(15)

where L = d1 + d2 + 2d3 is the whole width of the QWs; U and U′ are the electric potential strength for external
and interface, respectively; d4 is the eﬀective regime of the interface electric ﬁeld, which is stem from the localized
electron in the InAs layer and the localized hole in GaSb layer at the interface. The interface electric ﬁeld is original
from the structure asymmetry of AlSb/InAs/GaSb/AlSb QWs in Eq.(13). Besides, we assume that d4 < min{d1, d2}.
In practice, we chose d4 = d1+d2
. Also, the interface electric ﬁeld can be obtained through a self-consistent Poisson-
Schrodinger calculation[24–26]. However, we do not attempt to solve this self-consistent problem. Instead, we have
phenomenologically assumed an eﬀective electric potential occurring at the interface between InAs and GaSb.

4

Next, we ﬁx the interface electric ﬁeld(internal): U′ = 0.05 eV (strong enough), and we tune the external electric
ﬁeld(by tuning front gate and back gate), we get the relation between mini-gap ∆ and inversion band gap Eg with
the electric ﬁeld potential U . Compare Fig 2 in main text (without interface electric ﬁeld) and Fig.5 below, we may
ﬁnd the physics is not changed, expect that the ”critical” U moves to negative from zero. The results for mini-gap
and inversion band gap is similar to the results and explanation in the main text. Moreover, the external electric
potential (U ) will destroy the build-in interface electric potential (U′) by charge transfer.
