Abstract—This paper considers the problem of communication
over a memoryless classical-quantum wiretap channel subject to
the constraint that the eavesdropper on the channel should not
be able to learn whether the legitimate parties are using the
channel to communicate or not. Speciﬁcally, the relative entropy
between the output quantum states at the eavesdropper when
a codeword is transmitted and when no input is provided must
be sufﬁciently small. Extending earlier works, this paper proves
the “square-root law” for a broad class of classical-quantum
channels: the maximum amount of information that can be
reliably and covertly transmitted over n uses of such a channel
scales like √n. The scaling constant is also determined.

I. INTRODUCTION

Covert communication [1], sometimes also called de-
niable communication [2], stealth [3], or communication
with low probability of detection [4]–[6], refers to secret-
communication scenarios where the legitimate parties must
keep the eavesdropper from discovering the fact that they are
using the channel to communicate.

Many recent works study covert communication using
information-theoretic methods. Korzhik et al. [7] and Bash
et al. [4] observe that the amount of information that can be
reliably and covertly communicated over an additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel scales like the square root
of the number of times the channel is used. A similar result has
been known in steganography as the “square-root law”; see [8]
and references therein. Che et al. [2] prove the achievability of
the square-root law for the binary symmetric channel. Wang et
al. [5], [6] subsequently prove both achievability and converse
of the square-root law for a broad class of discrete memoryless
channels (DMCs), and also derive the exact scaling constant
for DMCs as well as for AWGN channels. Bloch [1] studies
covert communication from a resolvability perspective and
derives, among other things, the minimum length of secret
key required for such tasks.

Covert communication over various types of quantum chan-
nels has also been studied. For example, Bash et al. [9] study
covert quantum optical communication. Sheikholeslami et al.
[10] prove the achievability part of the square-root law for
more general classical-quantum channels: the inputs of such
channels are drawn from sets of (classical) symbols, and
the outputs are quantum states. They leave the converse of
the square-root law as an open problem, arguing that this
is related to the super-additivity of Holevo information [11],
[12] and hence may be a difﬁcult problem. However, Holevo

information is in fact not super-additive for classical-quantum
channels; see [13]. Consequently, the techniques in [6] can
be readily extended to classical-quantum channels to prove
the converse of the square-root law, establishing the fact that,
over a broad class of classical-quantum channels, optimal
throughput for covert communication indeed scales like the
square root of the number of channel uses.

The current paper extends the work of [10] and determines
the optimal throughput for covert communication up to the
dominant term. Our main result can be seen as a counterpart of
[6, Theorem 2] in the classical-quantum case, with one minor
generalization: [6] assumes that the eavesdropper observes
the same channel outputs as the intended receiver, while
the current paper assumes a more general wiretap channel
structure. Our converse is adapted from the classical proof
in [6], and our achievability largely follows that of [10].
Whereas [10] considers channels with only two distinct input
symbols, we allow the input alphabet to be any ﬁnite set, which
does not add signiﬁcant complication to the problem. On the
other hand, [10] also derives a bound on the length of the
secret key required for covert communication, while we are
not concerned with the key length but focus on the optimal
throughput.

The rest of this paper is arranged as follows. Section II
presents the channel model and the results. Section III proves
the main theorem; the converse proof is given completely,
while in the achievability proof we skip some less important
steps, because our proof techniques there are similar to those
in [10]. We conclude the paper with some remarks in Sec-
tion IV.

II. CHANNEL MODEL AND RESULTS

Consider a classical-quantum wiretap channel whose input
alphabet is X = {0, . . . , k − 1}. When a symbol x ∈ X is
transmitted, the corresponding channel output at the intended
receiver is a quantum state, described by a density operator
σ(x) acting on some Hilbert space Y. The corresponding
channel output at the eavesdropper is another quantum state
ρ(x) on some other Hilbert space Z.1 We assume that both
Y and Z have ﬁnite dimensions. The channel is assumed to

1Once the two output states are given, their joint state on Y⊗ Z is irrelevant
to the problem considered in this paper, hence we make no further assumption
on it. Note, however, that we do not assume that ρ(x) is a puriﬁcation of σ(x),
so the two states need not have the same eigenvalues.

be memoryless, so when a codeword xn = (x1, . . . , xn) is
transmitted over n channel uses, the joint output states at
the intended receiver and at the eavesdropper are described
by the density operators σ(x1) ⊗ ··· ⊗ σ(xn) on Y⊗n and
ρ(x1) ⊗ ··· ⊗ ρ(xn) on Z⊗n, respectively.
A deterministic channel code of blocklength2 n for the
message set M consists of an encoder f : M → X n, m 7→ xn,
and a decoding positive-operator valued measure (POVM) on
Y⊗n; the outcome of the POVM is the decoded message.
A random code of blocklength n for M is described by a
probability distribution on all deterministic codes of block-
length n for M. The average probability of error of a random
code is the average probability that the output of the decoding
POVM differs from the transmitted message M , where M
is uniformly chosen from M, independently of the random
choice of codebook.
Let 0 be the “off” symbol in X , which the transmitter
always transmits when switched off. The covertness constraint
is that the state observed by the eavesdropper should look
sufﬁciently close to ρ(0)⊗n, which is the state he would
observe if the transmitter were switched off. Speciﬁcally, as
in [6], [10], our covertness constraint is expressed in terms of
relative entropy

D(cid:0)ρn(cid:13)(cid:13)ρ(0)⊗n(cid:1) ≤ δ

for some positive δ. Here ρn denotes the joint output state
at the eavesdropper over n channel uses, produced by the
randomly chosen code and the uniformly chosen message, and
the quantum relative entropy D(·k·) is deﬁned, for any two
density operators A and B acting on the same Hilbert space,
as

∞,

D(AkB) =(tr [A log A − A log B] ,

supp(A) ⊆ supp(B),
otherwise.
(2)
Obviously, if, for some x ∈ X , supp(ρ(x)) 6⊆ supp(ρ(0)), then
using x will result in the left-hand side of (1) being inﬁnite,
and violating the covertness constraint for any δ. Hence, for
the purpose of the current work, we can discard all such input
symbols. This allows us to assume, for the rest of this paper,
that

supp(ρ(0)) = Z.

(3)

We are interested in characterizing the maximum amount of
information that can be transmitted over a classical-quantum
channel such that (1) is satisﬁed, and that the probability of a
decoding error can be made arbitrarily small at sufﬁciently
large blocklengths. Like in the classical case [1], [6], this
quantity can scale with √n in different ways. The key property
that distinguishes between these cases is whether ρ(0) can be
written as a mixture of {ρ(1), . . . , ρ(k − 1)} or not.
2We use the usual terminology “blocklength” to refer to the total number
of channel uses. However, it should be kept in mind that, in the square-root
case, the code can only be used once, because repeated transmissions will
eventually be discovered by the eavesdropper.

A. Positive-Rate Case

The following proposition characterizes the maximum
achievable rate for covert communication over a classical-
quantum channel.

Proposition 1: The maximum rate at which information
can be transmitted over the given channel with average error
probability tending to zero as the blocklength tends to inﬁnity
and subject to the covertness constraint (1), in nats per channel
use, is given by

max

P : Px P (x)ρ(x)=ρ(0)

χ(P ),

(4)

where χ(P ) is the Holevo information over the channel to the
intended receiver [11]:

χ(P ) = H Xx∈X

P (x)σ(x)! −Xx∈X

P (x)H (σ(x)) ,

(5)

with H(·) denoting the von Neumann entropy:

H(A) = −tr[A log A].

(6)

The proof of Proposition 1 is similar to the classical case

[6, Proposition 1] and is omitted.

Proposition 1 implies that a positive rate is achievable for
our task if, and only if, a distribution P on X exists that
satisﬁes the following conditions:

(1)

P (x)ρ(x) = ρ(0)

Xx

∃x ∈ supp(P ) : σ(x) 6= σ(0).

(7a)

(7b)

B. Square-Root Case

Now we assume that no P satisfying (7) can be found. In

addition, we assume that

supp (σ(x)) ⊆ supp (σ(0))

for all x ∈ X .

(8)

This case is the main focus of the current paper. Let Kn(δ, ǫ)
denote the maximum number of nats that can be sent over n
uses of this wiretap channel, with the average probability of
error at most ǫ, and satisfying the covertness constraint (1).

The main result of this paper is the following theorem, which
can be seen as a generalization of [6, Theorem 2].

holds, then L is ﬁnite and is given by

We next consider the covertness criterion. Let ρi denote the
ith partial trace of the joint output state ρn at the eavesdropper,
then

Finally consider the case where no P satisfying (7) can be
found, and where (8) does not hold. In this case, no positive
covert communication rate can be achieved, while L as deﬁned
in (9) is inﬁnite, hence the optimal throughput scales in a
sub-linear but super-square-root way with the blocklength n.
We do not further investigate this case in the current paper.
Note that, for the corresponding classical case, an achievability
result is given in [1, Theorem 7], but there does not yet exist
any nontrivial converse result, to the best of our knowledge.

III. PROOF OF THEOREM 1

In this section we prove Theorem 1. We divide the proof

into the converse part and the achievability part.

A. Converse

Consider a random code that transmits Kn nats of informa-
tion over n uses of the given channel with error probability
not exceeding ǫn. Let P n denote the input distribution induced
by the random code and the uniformly drawn message, and
let σn denote the joint output state over n channel uses at the
intended receiver. By Fano’s inequality and the data processing
inequality, we have

Kn(1 − ǫn) − 1 ≤ χn(P n),

(12)

where χn(P n) is the Holevo information over n uses of the
channel to the intended receiver, computed according to P n.
Let Pi and σi denote the ith marginal distribution of P n
and ith partial trace of σn, respectively. For classical-quantum
channels, Holevo information is not super-additive in the sense
that

σ(xi)! (13)

Further, because Holevo information is concave in the input
distribution (a consequence of the concavity of the von Neu-
mann entropy), we can write

nXi=1

χ(Pi) ≤ n χ(P ),

where P is the average input distribution

(30)

where the last step follows from the convexity of relative
entropy. Here, ¯ρ denotes the average output state at
the

Combining (20) and (28), and noting that ǫn must tend to

Next note that (32) requires

, n = 1, 2, . . . .

ρn = ρ(0).

lim
n→∞

Recall the assumption in Theorem 1 that no distribution P
satisfying (7) can be found. In this case, one can verify that
there is no loss of optimality in discarding all x such that
σ(x) = σ(0). After this is done, the only P on the remaining
input symbols that satisﬁes (7a) alone is P (0) = 1. Thus, to
satisfy (33), one needs

Pn(0) = 1.

lim
n→∞

(34)

Let

αn , 1 − Pn(0),
let ˜Pn denote the distribution given by

˜Pn(x) =

Pn(x)

αn

x 6= 0,

(35)

(36)

and let ˜ρn denote the state at the eavesdropper induced by ˜Pn.
Then

ρn = (1 − αn)ρ(0) + αn ˜ρn.

(37)

With (37), we can ﬁx ˜ρn and compute the ﬁrst and second
derivatives of the left-hand side of (32) with respect to αn,
using, e.g., [14, Theorem 11.9]. At αn = 0, the ﬁrst derivative
equals zero, and the second derivative is a version of the
quantum χ2-divergence [15], yielding

D ( ρnk ρ(0)) =

α2
n

2 (cid:0)tr[˜ρ2

αn ≤r δ

+ o(n−1/2).

(39)

On the other hand, by computing the ﬁrst derivative of the
Holevo information χ(Pn) with respect to αn (with ˜Pn ﬁxed)
we have

χ(Pn) = αnXx6=0

˜Pn(x)D (σ(x)kσ(0) ) + o(αn).

(40)

Combining (31), (39), and (40), and recalling that αn must
tend to zero as n tends to inﬁnity, prove the converse part of
Theorem 1.

B. Achievability

Let ˜P ∗ be the distribution that achieves the maximum
in (10), and let ˜ρ∗ be its corresponding output state at the
eavesdropper. Choose the sequence αn as

αn = (1 − β)r δ

n ·

where β is any constant in (0, 1). For every n, let Pn be given
by

Pn(0) = 1 − αn
Pn(x) = αn ˜P ∗(x),

x 6= 0.

(42a)
(42b)

We randomly generate a codebook (whose size we choose
later) by picking every input symbol
in every codeword
independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) according to
Pn. Using the same approximation as (38), we can check that,
for large enough n, our random codebook satisﬁes (1). Next,
by slightly modifying the proof techniques of [16], we obtain
a sufﬁcient condition on the sizes of these codebooks for the

average probability of a decoding error to tend to zero as n
tends to inﬁnity. This condition yields the lower bound

L ≥ sup(a(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

cρn(xn) is the “pinching” of ρn(xn) with respect to ρn as

deﬁned in [17]; and hA > 0i denotes the projector onto
the subspace on which the eigenvalues of the operator A are
positive. In proving (43) we make two main modiﬁcations to
the original proof techniques of [16]. The ﬁrst modiﬁcation is
to normalize the throughput by √nδ instead of n. The second
modiﬁcation is, instead of the optimal hypothesis test between
ρn(xn) and ρn, which corresponds to a projector of the form

we use a suboptimal test by replacing ρn(xn) withcρn(xn) in
For any γ ∈ (0, 1), deﬁne the set
An(γ) , {xn |Qxn(x) ≥ (1 − γ)Pn(x) for all x 6= 0} ,

(46)
where Qxn denotes the “type” of the vector xn [18]. We shall
see that, as n tends to inﬁnity, the probability that X n ∈
An(γ) tends to one. To this end, ﬁx any x 6= 0 such that
˜P (x) > 0. Using the Chernoff bound we obtain

which tends to zero as n tends to inﬁnity. For x 6= 0 and
˜P (x) = 0, we always have

Pr [QX n (x) < (1 − γ)Pn(x)] = 0.

(49)
Using the union bound and the fact that X is ﬁnite, we then
obtain
(50)

lim
n→∞

Pr [X n ∈ An] = 1.

Next we return to (43). Using the method of [17, Theorem

2] we have the following: for any parameter s ∈ (0, 1),

trhρn(xn)Dcρn(xn) − e

√nδaρn > 0Ei

≥ 1 − (n + 1)ke−ψn(s)+√nδas,

For every x, the logarithm term on the right-hand side of (54)
equals zero at s = 0, and its derivative is uniformly continuous
and equals −D (ρ(x)kρn) at s = 0 [10], [17]. Further note
that ρn → ρ(0) as n → ∞. Hence, for any θ ∈ (0, 1), there
exists some q > 0 such that, for all s ∈ (0, q), for large enough
n, and for every x 6= 0,

Plugging (61) into (51) we have that, for every xn ∈ An,

Theorem 1.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have seen that previous analysis of covert communica-
tion over classical channels can be combined with quantum
information theory to derive analogous results on classical-
quantum channels. Our converse proof relies on the fact that
Holevo information is not super-additive for classical-quantum
channels, hence it is cannot be easily extended to covert com-
munication of classical information over memoryless quantum
(not classical-quantum) channels. Determining whether the
square-root law also holds for quantum channels may be an
interesting problem for future work.
