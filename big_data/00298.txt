(Received today)

The production of strangeness on the nucleon and hyperon and hypernuclear production in heavy ion
collisions at relativistic energies and in antiproton annihilation on nuclei is discussed. The reaction
process is described by transport theory with focus on S = −2 channels and a comparison of diﬀerent
model interactions. The interactions of hyperons in nuclear matter is investigated in a novel SU(3)
approach. An outlook to the S = −3 sector and Ω− physics is given.

Introduction

Hyperons and hypernuclei are short-lived objects and as such do not exist as stable particles.
Their production always requires special eﬀorts, as reviewed e.g. in [1]. High energy hadronic reac-
tions provide a broad spectrum of ﬁnal fragments, thus being a very suitable tool for investigations
of strangeness in the nuclear medium. Below, we consider as an example strangeness production in
elementary hadronic (π, K) reactions on the nucleon. The production mechanism is described in the
Giessen resonance model. The target nucleon is excited into a nucleon resonance N∗ which is located
above the strangeness production threshold and decays to a hyperon Y and an antikaon K. This res-
onance mechanism is also an important scenario in hyperon production in heavy ion collisions. The
dense and hot environment in a heavy ion collision at energies of a few GeV per nucleon allows ad-
ditional production paths by secondary rescattering processes of hadrons already produced in earlier
stages of the reaction. The short-lived compressed and heated medium created in the interaction zone
will expand and cool and ﬁnally the baryons will form fragments. This rather complex evolution is
described in the initial phases by transport theory, supplemented by a statistical multi-fragmentation
approach for the ﬁnal step of fragment formation.

The production process is intimately connected to the interaction of hyperons with background
medium by setting the conditions for the existence of hypernuclear bound states, as in the case of the
Λ hyperon, or the non-existence of a particle-stable nuclear system like for the Σ baryons. Nucleons
and hyperons together are forming the ground state baryon S U(3) ﬂavor octet. SU(3) symmetry,
however is broken as becomes clear by the spread of about 400 MeV among the octet baryon masses.
Of course, broken SU(3) symmetry is taken onto account theoretically, at least on the level of masses
and the corresponding production thresholds. In this work, we study octet baryon interactions in free
space and cold inﬁnite matter and in the context of heavy ion collisions which is a highly dynamical

environment.

2. Strangeness production in elementary reactions

Strangeness production on the nucleon plays a key role for our understanding of baryon structure
and elementary reactions with hadrons. In addition, such production reactions are also an appropri-
ate tool to identify excited states N∗ of the nucleon which decay preferentially into hyperon-kaon
channels, thus adding to solve the problem of missing resonances. In [2] we have analysed the latest
CLAS-, CBELSA-data sets and re-analysed the earlier SAPHIR-data on photoproduction of kaons
on the nucleon. The Giessen model was used, describing meson production on the nucleon by a cou-
pled channels K-matrix approach including meson production by photo-production and pion-induced
reactions as initial channels. The Giessen model is obeying the elementary symmetries of hadron
physics and conserving unitarity. Meson production proceeds through s-channel resonances and t-
and u-channels re-scattering processes. Results for total cross sections are shown in Fig.1. Up to a
total center-of-mass energy of about √s = 2 GeV the data are well described.

Meson production through resonance excitation is one of the essential ingredients of the Giessen
model. This mechanism has also been used in pion-induced kaon production on nuclei. A fully quan-
tum mechanical approach was developed a few years ago in [3]. In the resonance model, including
± nucleon excitations, the production vertices are described by pseudo-scalar and pseudo-vector

solving the corresponding Klein-Gordon wave equations in eikonal approximation. Typical results

These results as well as similar investigations found in the literature, e.g. [9], illustrate that the basic
mechanism of strangeness production in reactions on the free nucleon and on nuclei is understood
essentially on a quantitative level.

Interactions in the baryon octet

It’s almost trivial to state that the quantitative understanding of hypernuclei requires an accurate
knowledge of hyperon-hyperon (YY) and hyperon-nucleon (YN) interactions. However, the solution
of this basic task is still far from being solved satisfactorily to the degree of accuracy required for
a hypernuclear theory of predictive power. The progress made in the last decade or so for S = −1
systems is only part of the full story since this involves mainly single-Λ hypernuclei in addition to
the few data points from old pΛ and pΣ experiments, e.g. in [10–12]. The latter are essential input
for the approaches developed over the years by several groups. While the Nijmegen [13, 14] and the
Juelich group [15], respectively, are using a baryon-meson approach, the Kyoto-Niigata group [16]
favors a quark-meson picture, ﬁnally ending also in meson-exchange interactions. However, none of
the existing parameter sets is in any sense constrained with respect to interactions in the |S| ≥ 2
channels. As a consequence, the implementation of SU(3) ﬂavor symmetry is incomplete. In view of
this situation, we found it necessary to reconsider interactions in the lowest SU(3) baryon octet with
special emphasis on in-medium interactions. As a long-term program the approach will allow to test
interactions more directly under the dynamical conditions of strangeness and hypernuclear production

reactions with leptonic, hadronic, and nuclear probes, up to heavy ion reactions at relativistic energies.
Hyperon and hypernuclear data from reactions are providing a wealth of information which has not
yet been taken advantage of in full depth.

SU(3) octet physics is based on treating the eight baryons on equal footing. Although SU(3) ﬂavor
symmetry is broken by about 20% on the mass scale, it is still meaningful to exploit the relations
among coupling constants, thus reducing the number of free parameters considerably. The eight JP =
+ baryons are collected into a traceless matrix B, which is given by a superposition of the eight

(9)

By the same approach, similar relations are found for the scalar and vector meson Lagrangians and
corresponding coupling constants.

3.1 SU(3) symmetry breaking

From the above relations, the advantage of referring to SU(3) symmetry is obvious: for each type
of meson (pseudo-scalar, vector, scalar) only four independent parameters are required to characterize
their interaction strengths with all possible baryons. These are the singlet coupling constant f0, the
octet coupling constant f8 ≡ f , the F/(F + D) ratios, and eventually a mixing angle which relates
the physical, dressed isoscalar mesons to their bare octet and singlet counterparts. However, SU(3)
symmetry is broken at several levels and SU(3) relations will not be satisﬁed exactly. An obvious one
is the non-degeneracy of the physical baryon and meson masses within the multiplets. As discussed
below, this splitting leads to additional complex structure in the set of coupled equations for the
scattering amplitudes because the various baryon-baryon (BB′) channels open at diﬀerent threshold
energies √sBB′ = mB + mB′. At energies s < sBB′ a given BB′-channel does not contain asymptotic
ﬂux but contributes as a virtual state. Thus, NΛ scattering, for example, will be modiﬁed at any energy
by admixtures of NΣ channels.

SU(3) symmetry is broken explicitly by the fact that Λ and Σ0 have the same quark content
but are coupled to diﬀerent total isospin and carry diﬀerent masses. There is an appreciable electro-
weak mixing between the ideal isospin-pure Λ and Σ0 states [17]. Exact SU(3) symmetry of strong
interactions predicts fΛΛπ0 = 0, but Λ-Σ0 mixing results in a weak, but non-zero ΛΛπ coupling
constant for the physical Λ-hyperon, as derived by Dalitz and von Hippel [17] already in the early
days of strangeness physics,

where the ΣΛ element of the mass matrix is given by

fΛΛπ = −2hΣ0|δM|Λi
MΣ0 − MΛ

fΛΣπ,

hΣ0|δM|Λi = hMΣ0 − MΣ+ + Mp − Mni /√3.

Substituting for the physical baryon masses, we ﬁnd fΛΛπ = cb fΛΣπ where cb = −0.0283... is the
symmetry breaking coeﬃcient. From the nucleon-nucleon-pion part of the interaction Lagrangian
(7), we ﬁnd

(N τN)·π = ppπ0 − nnπ0 + √2 pnπ+ + √2 npπ−,

5

(10)

(11)

(12)

and the neutral pion is seen to couple with opposite sign to neutrons and protons. This implies that
the non-zero fΛΛπ0 coupling produces considerable deviations from charge symmetry in Λp and Λn
interactions. Obviously, Λ-Σ0 mixing also gives rise to non-zero ΛΛ coupling constants for any (neu-
tral) isovector meson, in particular for the ρ vector meson and the δ/a0(980), the isovector member
of the 0+ meson octet, respectively but the latter couplings give rise to much smaller eﬀects.

As seen from Eq.(8), Λ and Σ hyperons are coupled by strong interactions leading to a strangeness-
and isospin/charge-conserving dynamical mixing of NΛ and NΣ channels. Again, corresponding ef-
fects are present also for vector-isovector and scalar-isovector mesons. As a result, channels of the
same total strangeness S and ﬁxed total charge Q are coupled already on the level of the elementary
vertices in free space. In asymmetric nuclear matter, this eﬀect is enhanced through the isovector
mean-ﬁeld produced by the ρ0 and the δ0 meson ﬁelds. This leads to a density dependent ΛΣ0 mix-
ing being proportional to the isovector mean-ﬁeld U1 ∼ ρ1 and determined by the isovector baryon
density ρ1 = ρn − ρp plus possible contributions from charged hyperons. As a result, Λ and Σ0 be-
come quasi-particles with mass eigenstates diﬀerent from the ﬂavor eigenstates. The total isospin is
of course conserved by virtue of the background medium.

3.2 Interactions and self-energies

On the tree-level the octet interaction Lagrangians discussed in the previous section correspond
to standard One Boson Exchange amplitudes. The full interaction amplitudes require the solution of
the Bethe-Salpeter equation. As in [18], we reduce the problem to an eﬀective Lippmann-Schwinger
equation by projecting out the time-like components by the Thompson method. However, diﬀer-
ent from the better known SU(2) nucleon-nucleon case [18, 19], the full SU(3) problem leads to
a set of coupled equations describing interactions within the set of channels of ﬁxed strangeness
S = 0, −1· · · − 4 and total charge Q, respectively, where the latter corresponds to ﬁx the third com-
ponent of the total isospin. Hence, in momentum representation and after performing a partial wave
decomposition we have to solve the coupled integral equation

Tab(q, q′) = ˜Vab(q, q′) +Xc

(13)

where the indices a, b, c account for all relevant quantum numbers in the corresponding ﬂavor and
partial wave channels. Gc denotes the Green’s function in the intermediate channel c, to be evaluated
at the on-shell total center-of-mass energy s. In nuclear matter, the projector Q(c)

Fermi spheres kF1,2 of particle 1 and particle 2. In practice, we use angle-averaged Pauli-projectors.
In free space we have Q(c)
F ≡ 1. Additional in-medium modiﬁcations are introduced by self-energy,
mainly modifying the propagators.

F = Θ(k2

The Born-term includes also the kinematical thresholds at s = sa, sb

˜V(q, q′) = V(q, q′)Θ(s − sa)Θ(s − sb)

(14)

thus accounting explicitly for SU(3) symmetry breaking. By a properly chosen quadrature method,
Eq.(13) is conveniently transformed into a numerically easy to solve linear system, see e.g. [19]. The
bare coupling constants { f0, f8, α}p,v,s must be determined phenomenologically by ﬁt to data where
at present the scarce data base inhibits a precise determination. A brief discussion of the approach
is found elsewhere in these proceedings [20] where also our results for free space cross sections are
shown.

The low-energy parameters are convenient measures to characterize the interactions strength. As
an example, we consider the eﬀective range expansion in the S = −2 singlet-even channels which are

gral of the K-matrix, aS E(kF) =
Corresponding relations are found also for the other interaction channels. Thus, up to a normaliza-
tion factor the scattering lengths correspond to in-medium eﬀective coupling constants. As seen in
Fig.(3) the interaction strength decreases rapidly in all channels with increasing density approaching
a plateau at densities close to nuclear equilibrium. Overall, the scattering lengths are only about 10%
of the values found in the NN-system, for the latter see e.g. [19], reﬂecting the much weaker YY
interaction.

With the T- and K-matrices available, we have access to the full scattering amplitude. For nuclear
structure work we are interested in the ﬁrst place on the G-matrix as introduced by Brueckner which
is nothing than the in-medium K-matrix. While the natural representation of the K -matrix is the
singlet/triplet-even/odd formalism, for nuclear matter calculations the explicit representation in terms
of spin-isospin operators is more convenient. The two representation are related by an orthogonal
transformation among the two operator sets. Thus, for each isospin doublet introduced in Eq.(5) we
obtain in non-relativistic reduction a structure familiar from the nucleon sector,

and also spin-orbit and rank-2 tensor terms are displayed. The amplitudes RS I(ξ, kF) are given ei-
ther in momentum space (ξ = k1, k2) or, if a static potential picture is an acceptable approximation,
in coordinate space (ξ = r1, r2). For a given (BB′)-combination some of the RS I may vanish. For-
mally, also the interactions involving the Σ -isotriplet can be cast into such a form, except that one

7

(or both) Pauli-type isospin operators have to be replaced by the proper spin-1 operator, τB → TΣ.
In general, the RS I are functionals of the ﬁeld operators, as studied in detail in our ﬁeld-theoretical
DDRH approach [7,18,21,22] and exploited later by many other groups by means of phenomenolog-
ical mean-ﬁeld parameterizations, e.g. [23]. In a single-hyperon spin-saturated nucleus the hyperon
mean-ﬁelds are then given by

where the central isoscalar and isovector potentials UYA
0,1(ρ0,1) are determined by the isoscalar and
isovector nuclear densities, ρ0,1 = ρn ± ρp, respectively. Similar expressions hold also for the spin-
orbit terms. An open problem for the future is the consistent treatment of three- and many-body
forces, urgently needed for neutron star physics, see e.g. [14].

4. Strangeness production in heavy ion collisions and antiproton annihilation

Heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies are an interesting and relatively new path to strangeness
and hypernuclear production by strong interaction. Experimentally, the HypHI group [32] at GSI has
initiated a strong activity in that direction, showing the feasibility of hyperon and hypernuclear pro-
duction by heavy ions. On the theory side, major activities in this direction are being made by the
Frankfurt-Mainz collaboration [29, 30] and our own investigations. In a series of paper [24–28] we
have been studying hyperon and hypernuclear production in proton and antiproton-induced reac-
tion and in heavy ion collisions leading to fragmentation into light hypernuclei. In [28] we have for
the ﬁrst time investigated the role and possible observable eﬀects of diﬀerent YN-interaction mod-
els on the strangeness dynamics of hadron-induced reactions. The main focus of that work was to

8

study to what extent diﬀerences in the elementary interaction model are reﬂected in hypernuclear
observables. As appropriate cases, being also of experimental interest for PANDA , we have cho-
sen antiproton annihilation leading to hyperon production and the interactions of secondary beam
of Ξ hyperons with nuclei, thus studying speciﬁcally the S = −2 sector of the theory. Improved
parameterizations for the cross sections of the S=-2 YN-channels are based on the microscopic cal-
culations of the Nijmegen group by Rijken et al. [13] and by Fujiwara et al. [16] and implemented
into the Giessen-BUU (GiBUU) transport model code [34]. In brief, our results are showing strong
dynamical response on the underlying ΞN-interactions. Diﬀerences are clearly visible in the yields of
multi-strangeness hypernuclear production in low-energy Ξ-induced reactions. Hence, the proposed
production experiments may lead to strong constraints on the high strangeness YN and YY interac-
tions.

Antiproton-induced primary reactions and the subsequent reactions with a secondary Ξ-beam are
described by the well-tested relativistic Boltzmann-Uheling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) transport approach.
The kinetic equations are numerically realized within the GiBUU transport model [34]. Thus, we
solve the transport equation

.

xm∗(cid:17) ∂k∗

(18)
which describes the dynamical evolution of the one-body phase-space distribution function f (x, k∗)
for the hadrons under the inﬂuence of a hadronic mean-ﬁeld (l.h.s. of Eq. (18)) and binary collisions
(r.h.s. of Eq. (18)). The mean-ﬁeld enters via the in-medium self-energies, Σµ = gωωµ + τ3gρρµ
3
and Σs = gσσ, into the transport equation, contained in the kinetic 4-momenta k∗µ = kµ − Σµ and
eﬀective (Dirac) masses m∗ = M − Σs. The various meson ﬁelds are obtained from the standard
Lagrangian equations of motion [33], extended to non-linear self-interactions of the σ ﬁeld [23]. A
schematic approach is used for the meson-hyperon mean-ﬁeld couplings which were obtained from
the nucleonic sector by a simple quark-counting rules. Of special interest, however, is the collision
term. Besides including all necessary binary processes for (anti)baryon-(anti)baryon, meson-baryon
and meson-meson scattering and annihilation [34], the most important ingredients are the new ΞN
cross section parameterizations.

The main results of our investigation in [28] are found in Fig.(4). The most remarkable feature is
the strong dependence of the distributions of Ξ-bound hypernuclei on the underlying ΞN model, al-
though both interactions are leading to almost identical S = −1 distributions [28]. While for the ESC
model the production probability of bound Ξ-matter is relatively low, the production of multi-strange
Ξ-systems considerably is considerably enhanced when using the FSS interactions. The diﬀerences
are of such a magnitude that a sizeable spread is predicted for the S = −2 production cross sections.
It would be therefore a challenge to measure exotic multi-strangeness hypermatter at PANDA in the
future, in order to better constrain the experimentally still unknown and theoretically obviously very
controversial interactions in the S = −2 channel, eventually ruling out certain approaches to YN and
YY interactions.
It is tempting to extend the investigations further into the sector of higher strangeness, both theo-
retically and experimentally. Possible routes are to study the production of nuclear multi-strangeness
states of octet hyperons, e.g. possible S = −3, −4 conﬁgurations built by combined ΛΞ and double-Ξ
states, respectively. Also the question of the possible existence of bound Σ-nuclei is still undecided.
An even more interesting direction is to leave the octet sector and extend the approach into the 3/2+-
baryon decuplet, containing on the one hand excited states of the octet baryons but also a completely
new particle, the Ω− hyperon. The Ω− is made out of three s-quarks, carrying a total strangeness of
S = −3. Thus, it is the baryon with largest possible strangeness content. As an outlook we report
here on ﬁrst steps towards Ω− production in ¯pA annihilation reactions. Already the description of the
production of a Ω− baryon is a challenge to theory. Direct p ¯p → Ω ¯Ω production is OZI-suppressed
because the creation of three s ¯s pairs out of the vacuum would be required. Hence, sequential pro-
cesses with step-wise strangeness accumulation are more likely. First results for such in-medium

In-medium Ω− production by sequential strangeness accumulation reactions. The momentum of the

cross sections are shown in Fig.(5). Inserting these cross sections into a full-scale transport calcula-
tion will allow to explore high-strangeness production processes quantitatively. Such calculations are
in preparation.

5. Summary

Strangeness physics is a ﬁeld of particular interest for our understanding of baryon dynamics in
the very general context of low-energy ﬂavor physics. The rich spectrum of phenomena is extend-
ing from strangeness production on elementary reactions on the nucleon, probing the full variety of
probes, ranging from virtual or real photons and leptons to elementary hadronic reactions and, as new
challenges, antiproton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus reactions. In this contribution, the richness of
phenomena was illustrated on selected examples. An outlook to extensions of hypernuclear physics
into the region of high strangeness |S| > 2 was given.
