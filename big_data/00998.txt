Draft version March 4, 2016

ABSTRACT

We report the likely detection of γ-ray emission from the northeast shell region of the historical
supernova remnant (SNR) SN 1006. Having analyzed 7 years of Fermi LAT Pass 8 data for the region
of SN 1006, we found a GeV gamma-ray source detected with ∼ 4σ signiﬁcance. Both the position
and spectrum of the source match those of HESS J1504−418 respectively, which is TeV emission from
SN 1006. Considering the source as the GeV γ-ray counterpart to SN 1006, the broadband spectral
energy distribution is found to be approximately consistent with the leptonic scenario that has been
proposed for the TeV emission from the SNR. Our result has likely conﬁrmed the previous study of the
SNRs with TeV shell-like morphology: SN 1006 is one of them sharing very similar peak luminosity
and spectral shape.

1. INTRODUCTION

As one of

the few supernova remnants

(SNRs)
that were historically recorded by people from diﬀer-
ent countries or continents (Stephenson & Green 2002;
Stephenson 2010), SN 1006 is of great interest and has
been extensively studied at multiple energy bands. It is
located far away from the Galactic plane, with a Galac-
tic latitude of ∼14.◦5, in a relatively low ambient-density
(∼ 0.085 cm−3; e.g., Katsuda et al. 2009) environment.
The long-term proper motion measurements of the shock
front at optical narrow band, combined with the ex-
panding velocity, implies a distance of ∼2.2 kpc for the
SNR (Winkler et al. 2003). Multiwavelength emission
from SN 1006 shows that the remnant has a diameter of
30′(or 19 pc at 2.2 kpc), with two main lobes located at
northeast (NE) and southwest (SW) parts of the SNR’s
disk-like region. While the interior of the SNR is dom-
inated by thermal emission (e.g., Uchida et al. 2013),
the shell is dominated by synchrotron emission which is
bright in radio (Reynolds & Gilmore 1986) and hard X-
ray (Rothenﬂug et al. 2004; Winkler et al. 2014) bands.
SNRs are considered to be the main sites in the Milky
Way for producing cosmic rays with energies up to a few
1015 eV. Charged particles are accelerated in their shock
fronts due to the diﬀusive shock acceleration mechanism
(e.g., Blandford & Eichler 1987). As for SN 1006, in ad-
dition to hard X-rays that indicate high-energy electrons
accelerated to 100 TeV in the shock front (Koyama et al.
1995), very high energy (VHE; > 100 GeV) emission
was also detected with the High Energy Stereoscopic
System (HESS). The two HESS sources J1504−418 and
J1502−421 correspond to the NE and SW shell regions
respectively (Acero et al. 2010), with the former approx-
imately 50% brighter than the latter. Given these, GeV

γ-ray emission from SN 1006 has been searched in ob-
servations with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-
board Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi). Us-
ing 3.5 and 6 years of Fermi LAT data, only upper lim-
its have been obtained by Araya & Frutos (2012) and
Acero et al. (2015a), respectively. Combining the TeV
spectrum with the GeV upper limits, a leptonic sce-
nario,
in which γ-ray photons arise from the inverse
Compton (IC) scattering process, is favored for the γ-
ray emission (Acero et al. 2010; Araya & Frutos 2012;
Acero et al. 2015a).

The Fermi upper limits already tightly constrain
the models typically considered for young SNRs (e.g.,
Cas A: Acero et al. 2010, Araya & Cui 2010; Tycho:
Giordano et al. 2012) or for SNRs having a TeV shell-
like morphology (Acero et al. 2015a). Evidence for the
interaction with a HI cloud in the SW limb region of
SN 1006 has been reported by Miceli et al. (2014). With
the release of the best Fermi LAT dataset (Pass 8 data)
in early 2015 and the accumulation of 7 years data, de-
tailed analysis of the γ-ray emission from SN 1006 is thus
warranted. In this paper we report our analysis of the
Fermi LAT data of the SN 1006 region and the likely de-
tection of γ-ray emission in 0.15–300 GeV energy range
from the NE region of the SNR.

2. DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

2.1. Fermi LAT Data

LAT is a γ-ray imaging instrument that scans the
whole sky every three hours and is basically con-
ducting long-term γ-ray observations of GeV sources
(Atwood et al. 2009). For this analysis we selected Fermi
LAT Pass 8 events in the energy range from 150 MeV to
300 GeV centered at the SIMBAD position of SN 1006,
which is (αJ2000, δJ2000) = (15h02m22.s1, −42◦05′49.′′0),
obtained by Wright & Otrupcek (1990). The events be-
low 150 MeV were excluded to reduce the eﬀects of
the Galactic background and the relatively large un-
certainties of the instrument response function of the
LAT in low energy range. The time period of the LAT
data is from 2008-08-04 15:43:36 (UTC) to 2015-09-24

2

00:03:16 (UTC). Following the recommendations of the
LAT team4, we included those events with zenith angles
less than 90 degrees, which prevents the Earth’s limb con-
tamination, and excluded the events with quality ﬂags of
‘bad’.

2.2. Source Detection

We included all sources within 20 degrees centered at
the position of SN 1006 in the Fermi LAT 4-year cata-
log (Acero et al. 2015b) to make the source model. The
spectral forms of these sources are provided in the cat-
alog. Spectral parameters of the sources within 5 de-
grees from SN 1006 were set as free parameters, and
the other parameters were ﬁxed at their catalog val-
ues. The background Galactic and extragalactic dif-
fuse emission were also added in the source model
with the spectral model gll iem v06.ﬁts and the ﬁle
iso P8R2 SOURCE V6 v06.txt, respectively, used. The
normalizations of the diﬀuse components were set as free
parameters.

We ﬁrst performed standard binned likelihood analy-
sis to the LAT data in the >1 GeV band using the LAT
science tool gtlike in the science tools software package
v10r0p5. The Instrument Response Functions (IRFs) of
P8R2 SOURCE V6 were used. Test Statistic (TS) maps
obtained in this higher energy range would likely be bet-
ter resolved in a possibly crowded region and source posi-
tions be better determined as well. With the ﬁtted source
model, we calculated the binned TS map (using gttsmap
in the Fermi software package) of a 2o × 2o region cen-
tered at SN 1006. All sources in the source model were
considered and removed. The obtained residual TS map
of the source region is shown in the top panel of Figure 1.
Excess emission in the SN 1006 region was detected with
a maximum TS value of ∼25. The TS value at a given
position is a measurement of the ﬁt improvement for in-
cluding a source, and is approximately the square of the
detection signiﬁcance of the source (Abdo et al. 2010).
Therefore, the excess was detected with 5σ signiﬁcance.
We noted that no catalog sources are within the square
region, but there is an additional source in the top left
corner of the TS map.

We investigated if the nearby additional source might
contaminate the detection of the excess emission in the
SN 1006 region. We ran gtﬁndsrc in the LAT software
package, and determined its position: (αJ2000, δJ2000)
= (227.◦0, −41.◦2) with 1σ nominal uncertainty of 0.◦2.
Adding the nearby source in the source model as a point
source with power-law emission at its best-ﬁt position, we
re-performed the binned likelihood analysis. The TS map
with this nearby source considered in the source model
is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 1. Now with
the nearby source totally removed, the maximum TS
value for the excess emission in the SN 1006 region was
∼22, still signiﬁcant. In the following analysis the nearby
source was considered in the source model. For the con-
ﬁrmed excess source, we determined its position, which
is (αJ2000, δJ2000) = (225.◦9, −41.◦8) with 1σ nominal
uncertainty of 0.◦1. The VHE source HESS J1504−418
(Acero et al. 2010, marked in Figure 1) is 0.◦08 from the
best-ﬁt position and within the 1σ error circle.

center of SN 1006 in the 1–300 GeV band, with the green dashed
circle indicating the X-ray region of SN 1006 and the green contours
indicating the 2.0–7.2 keV X-ray intensity measurements of the NE
and SW limbs of SN 1006 (at a level of 19 counts s−1; obtained
from the XMM-Newton map rebinned to the ∼0.◦04 pixel−1 scale).
The image scale of the maps is 0.◦04 pixel−1. All catalog sources
were considered and removed. The non-catalog source detected in
the top left corner (the top panel, indicated by a cyan cross) was
removed in the bottom panel. The dark and red crosses mark the
positions of HESS J1504−418 and QSO J1504−4152, respectively.
The dark dashed circle marks the 2σ error circle of the best-ﬁt
position obtained for the excess emission.

We then investigated whether the conﬁrmed excess
source is point-like or extended. Using both point-source
and uniform disk models with power-law spectra at the
best-ﬁt position, we performed likelihood analysis to the
data in 1–300 GeV energy range. The radius for the
uniform disk was set in a range of 0.◦1–0.◦5 with a step
of 0.◦1. The spectral parameters of the sources within
5 degrees from SN 1006 were set as free parameters,
and all other parameters in the source model were ﬁxed
at their catalog values. No signiﬁcant extended emis-
sion was detected. The TSext values, calculated from

TSdisk − TSpoint (see, e.g., Lande et al. 2012), were
smaller than 0. We included the excess source as a
point source in the source model with power-law emis-
sion and performed likelihood analysis in 0.15–300 GeV
band. The photon index Γ = 1.9±0.3 and the photon
ﬂux F0.15−300 = 7 ± 2 × 10−10 photons s−1 cm−2 were
obtained, with a TS value of 15.

2.3. Variability Analysis

In addition to the VHE source HESS J1504−418,
there is an another known source located in the 2σ
error circle of the best-ﬁt position, that is the quasar
QSO J1504−4152 (Winkler & Long 1997). Its position
is marked in Figure 1. Given that active galactic nuclei
(AGN) are the dominant source class detected by Fermi
LAT (Acero et al. 2015b), we thus searched for long-
term variability for the purpose of checking any possi-
ble association between QSO J1504−4152 and the excess
source. We calculated the variability index TSvar for the
point source in SN 1006 region with 87 time bins (each
bin constructed from 30-day data) in the energy range
of 0.15–300 GeV, following the procedure introduced in
Nolan et al. (2012). If the ﬂux is constant, TSvar would
be distributed as χ2 with 86 degrees of freedom. Vari-
able sources would thus be identiﬁed with TSvar larger
than 119.4 (at a 99% conﬁdence level in the χ2 distribu-
tion; see Nolan et al. 2012). The computed TSvar for the
source is 48.9, corresponding to a <1% conﬁdence level
for a variable source. The value indicates that there was
no signiﬁant long-term variability observed in the γ-ray
source.

2.4. Spectral Analysis

Considering the excess emission at the SN 1006 region
as a point source at the best-ﬁt position, we extracted its
γ-ray spectrum by performing likelihood analysis to the
LAT data in 5 evenly divided energy bands in logarithm
from 0.15–300 GeV. The excess emission was modelled
with a power law in each energy band. The ﬂuxes ob-
tained in this way are not dependent on the emission
model assumed for a source, providing a good descrip-
tion for the γ-ray emission of the source. In the extrac-
tion, the spectral normalizations of the sources within
5 degrees from the central position of SN 1006 were set
as free parameters, while all the other parameters of the
sources were ﬁxed at the values obtained from the above
maximum likelihood analysis. The obtained spectrum is
plotted in Figure 2, where we kept the data points with
TS greater than 9 (corresponding to the detection sig-
niﬁcance of 3σ), and derived 95% ﬂux upper limits oth-
erwise. The ﬂuxes (or ﬂux upper limits) and TS values
are provided in Table 1. We also estimated the system-
atic uncertainties for the spectral data points due to the
Galactic diﬀuse emission model, by repeating the likeli-
hood analysis in each energy band with the normalization
of the diﬀuse component artiﬁcially ﬁxed to the ±6% de-
viation from the best-ﬁt value (see e.g., Abdo et al. 2009,
2010a). The uncertainties estimated in this way are pro-
vided in Table 1, which have been considered together
with the statistic ones in Figure 2.

Radio (Allen et al. 2001), Suzaku X-ray (Bamba et al. 2008),
HESS (Acero et al. 2010) data are included. The solid curve is
the model spectra when αe = 2.2.

As shown in Figure 1 and 2, both the position and spec-
trum (i.e., the high-energy data point at 30 GeV; see
Table 1) match those of the TeV emission from the NE
shell region of SN 1006 (see Acero et al. 2010 for details).
The detected excess emission may well be the GeV coun-
terpart to SN 1006 that has been previously searched
(Araya & Frutos 2012; Acero et al. 2015a). We tested
to repeat the analysis in Acero et al. (2015a), where 6
years of P7REP data were used, and obtained the same
non-detection result as theirs. Then as we changed to
repeat our above analysis using Pass 8 data in the same
6 years time period, the >1 GeV excess emission was
detected with TS≃ 20. Therefore our detection of the
source should be due to the overall sensitivity improve-
ment in the Pass 8 data.

3.1. Model Fitting

3. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

Having analyzed 7 years of Fermi LAT Pass 8 data,
we found excess γ-ray emission at the SN 1006 region.

Considering the Fermi source as the GeV counter-
part and combining its spectrum with the HESS TeV
one, we checked if a leptonic model that has been

4

proposed (see Acero et al. 2010; Araya & Frutos 2012;
Acero et al. 2015a) could decribe the broadband spec-
trum of SN 1006. We employed a simple one-zone sta-
tionary model, in which the synchrotron and IC emis-
sion originates from the same population of electrons
with a power-law form plus an exponential cutoﬀ. Given
the radio spectral index of ∼0.6 (e.g., Allen et al. 2001),
the electron spectral index was set to αe = 2.2. To ﬁt
the data, for which we have included radio (Allen et al.
2001), X-ray (Bamba et al. 2008), and GeV and TeV γ-
ray, the required parameters were found to be: the cut-
oﬀ energy Ecut,e ≈ 17 TeV, the total electron energy
We(> 1GeV) ≈ 1.6 × 1047 erg, and the magnetic ﬁeld
strength BSNR ≈ 24 µG. These parameter values are
compatible with those considered in the previous leptonic
models (see Araya & Frutos 2012; Acero et al. 2015a).
The broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) and
the model spectrum are shown in Figure 3, where be-
cause the radio and X-ray data were emission from the
whole remnant, the synchrotron ﬂux was multiplied by a
factor of 2 in our calculation assuming a symmetry be-
tween the NE and SW parts for simplicity. Not surpris-
ingly as indicated by the previous studies, the leptonic
model generally can describe the broadband data. The
observed ﬂux at 1.5 GeV is higher than the model ﬂux,
but within the 2σ uncertainty.

3.2. Summary

Analysis of the lastest Fermi LAT Pass 8 data for the
SN 1006 region results in the detection of a source at a
∼ 4σ signiﬁcance level in 0.15–300 GeV. The spectrum
of the excess emission can be described by a Γ = 1.9
power law (the dashed line in Figure 2), which can be
connected to the HESS spectrum. Both the quasar QSO
J1504−4152 (Winkler & Long 1997) and the VHE source
HESS J1504−418 (Acero et al. 2010) are within the 2σ
error circle of the best-ﬁt position of the source. We
searched for variability in the source, but no signiﬁ-
cant variations were found. In addition the spectral in-
dex of 1.9 does not favor the association to AGN since
AGN generally have soft power-law spectra with pho-
ton indices up to ∼3.0 in the LAT γ-ray energy range
(Ackermann et al. 2015). All of these indicate the source
is more likely the GeV counterpart to SN 1006.

The combined Fermi LAT and HESS spectrum can be
described by a leptonic model with reasonable parame-
ters, although the data point at 1.5 GeV is slightly higher
than our model spectrum. The discrepancy may sug-
gest that a more complicated model, e.g., multi-emission
zones, would be needed in order to better ﬁt the broad-
band SED. On the other hand, we note that the index
Γ = 1.9 ± 0.3 is compatible with those of the other 4 (RX
J1713.7−3946, RX J0852.0−4622, RCW 86, and HESS
J1731−347; Γ ∼ 1.5) TeV shell SNRs summarized by
Acero et al. (2015a). This similarity may provide addi-
tional evidence for supporting the γ-ray excess emission
as the counterpart to the SNR. At the source distance of

2.2 kpc, the 0.15–300 GeV luminosity is 1×1033 erg s−1,
estimated from the best-ﬁt model. The luminosity value
is consistent with the general emissional property for
the currently Fermi detected SNRs: young SNRs (with
ages no larger than a few thousands of years) have γ-ray
luminosities of ∼ 1033–1034 erg s−1, while middle-aged,

systematic ones, respectively.

dynamically evolved SNRs are two orders of magnitude
brighter due to their interaction with nearby molecular
clouds (see, e.g., Xing et al. 2015 and references therein).
Finally, Miceli et al. (2014) have reported that the SW
limb of SN 1006 is interacting with an atomic cloud, and
predicted a 3–30 GeV ﬂux of 5×10−13 erg cm−2 s−1 based
on their hadronic model proposed to explain the TeV
emission. The ﬂux is reached with the current Fermi
LAT data (see Figure 2). However in our analysis, we
did not see any signiﬁcant sources in the SW region of
SN 1006 (see Figure 1). A simple estimation for its ﬂux
can be used by scaling the NE ﬂux with the ratio be-
tween the HESS SW and NE ﬂuxes (0.67; Acero et al.
2010), which gives 1.5–3.4×10−13 erg cm−2 s−1 and 0.8–
3.6×10−13 erg cm−2 s−1 at 1.5 and 30 GeV (Table 1), re-
spectively. With the Fermi LAT observation time in-
creasing for the source region, it can be expected that
the SW GeV emission would likely be detected in the
near future. The detection will help conﬁrm our result
presented here in this work.
