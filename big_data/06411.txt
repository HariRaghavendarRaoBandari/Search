Abstract

We consider the theory of an open string moving in a weakly curved background,
composed of a constant metric and a linearly coordinate dependent Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld
with an inﬁnitesimal ﬁeld strength. We ﬁnd its T-dual using the generalized Buscher
procedure developed for the closed string moving in a weakly curved background, using
the fact that solving the boundary conditions, the open string theory transforms to the
eﬀective closed string theory. So, T-dualizing the eﬀective theory along all eﬀective
directions we obtain its T-dual theory and resume the open sting theory which has
such an eﬀective theory. In this way we obtain the open string theory T-dual.

Introduction

T-duality (reviewed in [1, 2]) is a symmetry of a string spectrum, exchanging the momen-
tum and the winding numbers, a symmetry which was not encountered in any point par-
ticle theory [1, 2, 3, 4], a symmetry which is therefore naturally assumed to be connected
with the fact that the strings unlike the point particles can wrap around compactiﬁed
dimensions [5, 6, 7]. T-duality is a symmetry which connects string theories which are
physically equivalent, but describe the strings which move in space-times with diﬀerent
geometries of the compactiﬁed dimensions. The theory with one dimension compactiﬁed
on a circle of radius R is by T-duality physically equivalent to the theory with one di-
mension compactiﬁed on a circle of radius ls/R, where ls is the fundamental string length
scale.

Existence of T-duality, initiated the search for the T-dualization procedure, the set of
rules which give a prescription for determining all string theories T-dual to the one given
theory. The problem was solved for some particular backgrounds. The ﬁrst investigations

addressing the problem, were done for a background containing a metric Gµν , an antisym-
metric ﬁeld Bµν and a dilaton ﬁeld Φ, and it was required that the metric admits at least
one abelian isometry which leaves the action invariant. The investigation resulted in the
Buscher procedure [8, 9, 10]. This procedure oﬀers the prescription, founded in localizing
the global isometry. The main object of the procedure is a gauge invariant action, which
carries the information on both the initial theory and the T-dual theory, so that both of
these theories can be obtained from the qauge invariant action for one of the two of its
equations of motion. The procedure is applicable to the constant background and the
coordinate dependent backgrounds, but only along directions which do not appear as the
background ﬁeld’s arguments. Our papers [11, 12, 13] oﬀered the generalized procedure,
which is applicable along arbitrary coordinate regardless of weather this coordinate ap-
pears as an argument of the background ﬁelds or not. The main diﬀerence between the
standard and the generalized procedure is that in the generalized procedure, in addition to
the introduction of the gauge ﬁelds and the covariant derivatives one should also introduce
an invariant argument which is deﬁned as a line integral of the gauge ﬁelds. The general-
ized procedure was realized for the closed string moving in a curved background with an
inﬁnitesimal coordinate dependence, named the weakly curved background [11]. A more
general procedure was deﬁned in [12] for a weakly curved background of the second order,
which does not possess the global isometry. In this paper, we will use the ﬁrst version
of the generalized procedure to address the T-duality of an open string moving in the
weakly curved background. T-duality of an open string moving in a background of type
IIB, was a subject of investigation in [14, 15]. T-duality of an open string diﬀers from the
closed string T-duality, due to a simple fact that the open string does not have a winding
number. Its ends move on a Dirichlet branes and can simply unwind [16].

The investigation of an open bosonic string moving in a weakly curved background,
done in papers [17, 18, 19], dedicated to solving the boundary conditions, showed that
the eﬀective theory obtained for the solution of the boundary conditions is in fact a
closed string theory. The boundary conditions were treated by Dirac method in [17, 18].
The paper [19] included a close examination of the parity of the boundary conditions,
equations of motion and the consistency conditions. Both approaches lead to equivalent
solutions. The eﬀective theory, obtained for the solution, is deﬁned on the doubled target
space, which consists of a symmetric and an antisymmetric variables (qµ, ˜qµ), with the
ﬁrst variable being the even part of the initial coordinate and the second variable being
the double of the ﬁrst variable. The eﬀective metric depends on the eﬀective coordinate
qµ, while the eﬀective Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld depends on a double variable ˜qν.

In this paper, we will apply the generalized Buscher procedure [11, 12, 13], developed
for the closed string moving in the weakly curved background, to the eﬀective closed
string theory, obtained for the solution of the open string boundary conditions, along all

2

eﬀective coordinates. We will obtain its T-dual theory. We will show that T-dualization
of the obtained theory along all dual coordinates leads to the initial theory. Our main goal
is to ﬁnd the open string T-dual. So, we’ll assume that the obtained T-dual theory is an
eﬀective theory of some open string theory. We search for the explicit form of this theory.
Demanding that the eﬀective theory of the unknown theory is exactly the T-dual theory,
we obtain a T-dual of the initial open string theory. The obtained theory is deﬁned in the
geometrical space, on the contrary to the closed string case, where the T-dualization led
to a T-dual theory deﬁned on the non-geometrical double space. The relations between
the initial background and its T-dual, diﬀer from those in the closed string case.

2 Open string theory in a weakly curved background (reca-

pitulation)

Let us consider an open bosonic string moving in a background deﬁned by a metric tensor
Gµν , an antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld Bµν, and a constant dilaton ﬁeld Φ = const,
described by the action [3, 4]

S[x] = κZΣ

d2ξ ∂+xµΠ+µν (x)∂−xν,

(2.1)

where the integration goes over the two-dimensional world-sheet Σ parametrized by ξ0 =
τ , ξ1 = σ with σ ∈ [0, π], the light-cone coordinates and their derivatives are ξ± =
1
∂± = ∂τ ± ∂σ, the coordinates of the D-dimensional space-time are xµ(ξ),
2 (τ ± σ),
µ = 0, 1, ..., D − 1 and Π±µν is a combination of the background ﬁelds, deﬁned by

Π±µν (x) = Bµν(x) ±

1
2

Gµν (x).

(2.2)

We will also use the notation ˙x = ∂x

∂τ , x′ = ∂x
∂σ .

We will consider the open string moving in the weakly curved background [20, 21, 22,

23], deﬁned by

Gµν = const, Bµν(x) = bµν +

Bµνρxρ,

(2.3)

where the parameter bµν is constant and Bµνρ is constant and inﬁnitesimal. Through
the paper we will work in the linear order in Bµνρ, and in this approximation the weakly
curved background obeys the space-time equations of motion

obtained from the requirement of the conformal invariance of the quantum theory, which
are given here in the lowest order in a slope parameter α′ and for the constant dilaton
ﬁeld Φ = const.

The minimal action principle for the open string, described by (2.1), gives the equation

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

Solving of these boundary conditions was a subject of investigation of our papers
[17, 18, 19]. In the ﬁrst two papers, the conditions were treated as constraints and we
applied the Dirac consistency procedure. We obtained the inﬁnite number of constraints,
gathered them into two parameter dependent constraints, which were solved. We obtained
the form of the initial coordinates satisfying the boundary conditions. In the paper [19], we
obtained the analogous result by examining the parity of the equations of motion, bound-
ary conditions and the consistency conditions. The solution of the boundary condition at
σ = 0 is

∂±xµ = (G−1)µρhGρν − Aρν (˜q) ± 2Bρν(q)i∂±qν,

(2.9)

, qµ is the even part of the initial

coordinate

where Aρν(˜q) =hh(˜q) − 12bh(˜q)b − 12h(b˜q)b + 12bh(b˜q)iρν

Changing the domain to σ ∈ [−π, π], one enables the solution (2.9) to satisfy the
boundary condition at the other string end-point as well. For details see [19]. Substituting
the solution (2.9) to the initial action we obtain the eﬀective theory

The obtained theory is equivalent to the initial theory, and it describes the eﬀective
close string. We are interested in ﬁnding its T-dual, which can be done using a generalized
Buscher procedure, developed in [11, 12, 13]. In general, the procedure could be applied
along arbitrary set of the eﬀective coordinates. In this paper, we will investigate only the
application along all eﬀective coordinates.

3 T-dualization of the eﬀective theory

Let us apply the generalized Buscher T-dualization procedure, introduced in [11], to the
eﬀective theory (2.12) along all eﬀective directions qµ. The ﬁrst task is to localize the
global symmetry δqµ = λµ = const and ﬁnd the gauge invariant action. Following the
procedure, we substitute the light-cone derivatives ∂±qµ of the eﬀective theory (2.12) with
the covariant derivatives D±qµ, deﬁned by

D±qµ = ∂±qµ + vµ
±,

(3.1)

± are the gauge ﬁelds, which transform as δvµ

where vµ
± = −∂±λµ. We also substitute the
argument of the background ﬁelds, with an invariant argument, which is obtained substi-
tuting the eﬀective coordinate qµ and its double ˜qµ with an invariant eﬀective coordinate
and its double, deﬁned by the following line integrals of the gauge ﬁelds

gauge by qµ(ξ) = qµ(ξ0), we obtain the gauge ﬁxed action, which reads

The next step in the T-dualization procedure is ﬁnding the equations of motion of
the gauge ﬁxed action. For the equation of motion for the Lagrange multiplier the action
will reduce to the initial action, while for the equation for the gauge ﬁelds the action will
become the T-dual action. Varying the action (3.3), one obtains the following equations

3.1 Regaining the eﬀective theory

Solving the equation (3.4), by

vµ
± = ∂±qµ,

one obtains V µ = qµ and ˜V µ = ˜qµ. Substituting these relations to the gauge ﬁxed action
(3.3), one conﬁrms that it reduces to the eﬀective action (2.12).

3.2 T-dual theory

To obtain the T-dual action, one should substitute the expressions for the gauge ﬁelds to
the gauge ﬁxed action. The gauge ﬁelds are obtained, multiplying the equation of motion
(3.5), by the inverse of Πef f

and the fact that the open string eﬀective metric (A.2) is the same in both initial and the
eﬀective background, (A.4), one obtains the explicit value of the arguments (3.2)

(3.13)

Comparing the forms of the eﬀective action (2.12) and the T-dual action (3.11), we

see that they are equal under the following transformations

∂±qµ → ∂±̺µ,
+µν → ⋆Πµν

where the T-dual background is

(3.14)

(3.15)

Using (A.9), we obtain the T-dual metric ⋆Gµν which depends on the ﬁrst variable ∆V µ
and the T-dual Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld ⋆Bµν, which depends on the second variable 2bµ

(3.16)

We see, that the eﬀective metric has transformed to its inverse and that the Kalb-Ramond
ﬁeld has transformed to the inﬁnitesimal part of the non-commutativity parameter.

Comparing the actions one could conclude that the relation between the variables of
the eﬀective theory and its T-dual is simple as in (3.14). However, the real connection
is given by the T-dual coordinate transformation law, which is obtained comparing the
expressions for the gauge ﬁelds (3.9) and (3.10), and it reads

∂±qµ ∼= −κ(Θef f

In the zeroth order this law gives

(3.18)

4 T-dulization of T-dual theory

Let us now show that the T-dualization of the T-dual theory leads to the initial eﬀective
theory. Following the T-dualization procedure, we localize the global symmetry δ̺µ =
λµ = const. We introduce the gauge ﬁelds u±µ, which transform as δu±µ = −∂±λµ,
substitute the ordinary derivatives ∂±̺µ in the T-dual action (3.11) by the covariant
derivatives D±̺µ = ∂±̺µ + u±µ, substitute the coordinate ̺µ and its double ˜̺µ in the

the gauge by ̺µ(ξ) = ̺µ(ξ0). In this way, we obtain the gauge ﬁxed action for the T-dual
action (3.11), which reads

background ﬁeld’s argument by an invariant coordinate ∆Uµ = RP (dξ+u+µ + dξ−u−µ),
and its double ∆eUµ =RP (dξ+u+µ − dξ−u−µ), add the Lagrange multiplier ς µ term and ﬁx

The gauge ﬁxed action (4.1) reduces to its initial theory (3.11) for the equation of
motion for the Lagrange multiplier (4.2) and to the eﬀective theory for the equation of
motion for the gauge ﬁelds (4.5). One can verify that the solution of the equation (4.2)

which implies V µ(U ) = V µ(̺) and ˜V µ(U ) = ˜V µ(̺) transforms the gauge ﬁxed action (4.1)
to the T-dual action (3.11). On the other hand, substituting the gauge ﬁelds (4.5) to the
gauge ﬁxed action (4.1), using the zeroth order value of the gauge ﬁelds

while V (0)µ(U (0)) = ς µ and ˜V (0)µ(U (0)) = ˜ς µ, one obtains the eﬀective theory (2.12), with
qµ = ς µ. The results show that T-dual of the T-dual is the initial theory.

Comparing the expressions for the gauge ﬁelds (4.6) and (4.5), we obtain the T-dual

5 Open string T-dual

(4.9)

(4.10)

Our goal is to ﬁnd an open string theory such that its eﬀective theory, obtained for the
solution of the boundary conditions is exactly the T-dual theory (3.11). So, let us ﬁnd the
open string theory

is the T-dual theory (3.11). The eﬀective background is composed of the metric (eGef f )µν =
E = (cid:0)eG − 4eB2(cid:1)µν and the Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld Bef f
eGµν

variables are qµ(y), which is the even part of the variable yµ and ˜qµ(y) is its double.

Let us ﬁrst make a connection between the variables of these two theories. We suppose

tµ = 2(G−1bg−1

Using (5.6) and (5.3) we can note that

(5.8)

on the other hand from (5.3) follows that ¯qµ(y) = Dµν tν, so we conclude that D = ∓C.
Therefore, the coordinate that solves the boundary conditions of the unknown theory (5.1)
is just

yµ = qµ(y) + ¯qµ(y) = Cµν (zν ∓ tν) = Cµν(cid:0)(g−1

∓(cid:2)C T ˜h(Ct)C + 4bC T ˜h(Ct)Cb(cid:3) = h(t) + 4bh(t)b,

with the following solution

˜h(Ct) = ∓(C T )−1h(t)C −1.

Finally, we determine the open string T-dual background. It reads

eG = −(C T )−1GC −1,
eB(y) = ±(C T )−1(b − h(C −1y))C −1.

Comparing the initial open string theory (2.1) and its T-dual (5.1), in the background

(5.13), we see that they are equal under the following transformations

∂±xµ → ∂±yµ,

G → eG = −(C T )−1GC −1,

B(x) = b + h(x) → eB(y) = ±(C T )−1(b − h(C −1y))C −1.

6 Conclusion

In this paper we were looking for a T-dual of an open string moving in a weakly curved
background. The starting theory S, was a subject of investigation in our previous papers
[17, 18, 19], where it was shown that solving the boundary conditions at the open string
end-points, one obtains the eﬀective closed string described by the eﬀective closed string
theory Sef f , deﬁned on the doubled space (qµ, ˜qµ). The T-duals of such a theory, can be
determined using the generalized Buscher T-dualization procedure, which we developed
earlier in Refs. [11, 12, 13]. In this paper we performed the T-dualization procedure along
all eﬀective directions qµ. We obtained the T-dual theory ⋆Sef f . Applying the procedure
to the obtained theory along all dual directions ̺µ, we returned to the eﬀective theory.

11

So, we proved Sef f T
its eﬀective theory is ⋆Sef f exactly. We found the explicit form of ˜S.

←→ ⋆Sef f . Finally, we searched for the open string theory ˜S such that

The relations between the theories investigated, are represented in the following dia-

On the left hand side are the open string theories, depending on the ordinary coordi-
nates xµ and yµ. On the right hand side are the eﬀective theories of the open string
theories, obtained for the solution of the boundary conditions. These theories are deﬁned
on the doubled spaces, which consist of the eﬀective variables which are the even parts
of the ordinary coordinates and their doubles. The eﬀective theories are T-dual to each
other, therefore their variables are connected by the T-dual coordinate transformation
laws (3.17) and (4.9). The obtained T-dual coordinate transformation laws, could be used
for investigation of the relations between the geometrical properties of the correspond-
ing spaces.
It is interesting to notice that the T-dualization of a closed string theory
[11, 12, 13] led to a T-dual theory with the target space which signiﬁcantly diﬀers from
the initial space. While the initial theory was deﬁned in the ordinary space the T-dual was
deﬁned in the doubled space. In the open string case investigated here, the T-dualization
does not cause such a transition. Both the initial theory and its T-dual are deﬁned on the
geometrical space.

with eGµν , eBµν(y) given explicitly by (5.13). One can notice that the relation between the

initial background and its T-dual in the open string case diﬀers from that in the closed
string case, as it should be expected. In the closed string case, the T-duality transforms
the constant metric of the weakly curved background to a coordinate dependent eﬀective
metric inverse, while the linearly coordinate dependent Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld is transformed
into a coordinate dependent non-commutativity parameter. In the open string case, the
important role in the relation between the T-dual backgrounds plays a matrix C, which is
introduced to deﬁne the connection between the variables of the open string theory T-dual
and the eﬀective theory T-dual. It is obtained, that T-duality transforms the constant
metric of the weakly curved background to a constant T-dual metric, while the coordinate
dependent Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld transforms again to the coordinate dependent ﬁeld, which
