Polyhedral Embeddings and Immersions of
Many Triangulated 2-Manifolds with Few

Vertices

Ulrich Brehm, Undine Leopold

March 17, 2016

Abstract

This article presents an improvement and extension of the heuristic
ﬁrst presented by Hougardy et. al. [HLZ10] for realizing triangulated
orientable surfaces with few vertices by a simplex-wise linear embed-
ding. The improvement consists in the applicability to non-orientable
surfaces (simplex-wise linear immersions) as well as symmetric real-
izations. With the help of our algorithm, numerous - often symmetric
- realizations of non-orientable surfaces with the minimal number or
few vertices have been obtained for the ﬁrst time. These examples in-
clude the the Projective Plane with one or two handles and the Klein
Bottle with one or two handles.

Introduction

Due to Steinitz’ theorem [Ste22, Zie95], every polyhedral map on the sphere
can be realized as the boundary complex of a convex 3-polytope. In [ABEM07],
it is proved that all triangulations on the torus can also be geometrically re-
alized in 3-space without self-intersection. For triangulations of orientable
(closed) surfaces of higher genus, deciding the question of geometric real-
izability may present a challenging problem; the result by Bokowski and
Guedes de Oliveira [BGdO00] proves that there are triangulations which are

1

not realizable as an embedded polyhedral surface. By Schewe’s result [Sch10],
this holds true even for every genus greater than or equal to 5. Moreover, a
similar question can be posed for non-orientable triangulated surfaces, where
geometric realization means immersion with ﬂat, full-dimensional faces. In
that context, an older result of the ﬁrst author [Bre83] shows that every non-
orientable surface possesses triangulations which are not realizable in this
way.

A naturally arising extremal problem is that of ﬁnding the minimal num-
ber of vertices suﬃcient for a geometric realization of a particular surface.
The Heawood bound (see Section 2) provides only a combinatorial lower
bound. For a long time, computational search for realizations was too time-
consuming, so examples have been constructed intuitively by hand, with
Bokowski’s rubber-band technique [Bok89, Bok08], or with the help of a
graphics software. See [Cs´a49, Bre81, Bre87b, BB89, Bre90, Cer94] for ex-
amples.

In [Lut08], Lutz ﬁrst described a method for random realization of poly-
hedral embeddings of triangulated surfaces with few vertices. Random sets
of integer coordinates were tested on their compatibility with the given tri-
angulation. Furthermore, successful sets of coordinates were “recycled” or
perturbed slightly and then tested for other triangulations. In a second pa-
per, Hougardy, Lutz, and Zelke [HLZ10] described a search heuristic on the
integer lattice, decreasing an objective function measuring the length of the
self-intersection to zero (signifying that an embedding has been reached).

Remarkably, both methods lead to success, with the search heuristic prov-
ing to be clearly superior over random realization. Intrigued, we adapted the
algorithm presented in [HLZ10] to deal with two new situations: immersed
triangulations and symmetric realizations (for small symmetry groups). As
input we used the complete lists of triangulations from Lutz’s Manifold Page
[Lut16].

With a modiﬁed objective function we have been able to produce surpris-
ingly many results, for example for triangulated projective planes and Klein
bottles with 9 vertices. Also, for the ﬁrst time, polyhedral realizations of
triangulations of the non-orientable surfaces of genus 3, 4, 5, and 6, with 9,
10, 10, and 10 vertices, respectively, have been obtained. As a consequence,
the extremal problem of determining the minimal number of vertices needed
for a geometric realization has been settled for the genera 3, 5, and 6. Note
that the minimality for the non-orientable surfaces of genus 3 and 6 is due
to the Heawood bound [Hea90] (see also Section 2). However, for the non-
orientable surface of genus 5, the second author proved that 9 vertices do not
suﬃce for a realization, and thus 10 is minimal [Leo09, Leo16b].

To the best of our knowledge, the only vertex-minimal realizations of

2

non-orientable surfaces prior to our investigation were obtained by explicit
construction; Brehm [Bre90] constructed examples for the projective plane
with 9 vertices (and showed that fewer vertices do not suﬃce), and Cervone
[Cer94] found some examples for the Klein bottle using 9 vertices (and proved
that 8, the combinatorial minimum, do not suﬃce for a geometric realization).
Furthermore, with our adapted search heuristic symmetric realizations
have been obtained in numerous cases. As we had hoped, imposing suit-
able symmetry conditions (compatible with subsets of the Euclidean integer
lattice) and thus reducing the number of parameters sped up the search in
many cases. For example, we found 35 symmetric polyhedral realizations
of triangulations of the orientable surface M5 of genus 5. This more than
doubles the number of (un-symmetric) vertex-minimal examples of [HLZ10].
Moreover, we also obtained symmetric polyhedral realizations (immersions)
with 10 vertices of triangulations of the non-orientable surfaces N4 of genus
4, N5 of genus 5, and N6 of genus 6. Our results, which are described in
detail in Section 5 and Section 6, are summarized brieﬂy in Table 1.

realizations of the combinatorially regular 15-vertex triangulation {3, 10}6 of

belongs to the same family of regular triangulations as Dyck’s regular map
{3, 8}6 (see [CM80, Bok89, Bre87a]).

2 Background
A 2-manifold S is a Hausdorﬀ space which is locally homeomorphic to R2
(sometimes this requirement is relaxed, allowing boundaries). Compact 2-
manifolds are called closed surfaces. Closed connected surfaces are classiﬁed
abstractly as the g-fold connected sum of tori T2# . . . #T2 in the orientable
case (a sphere with g handles), denoted Mg, or the h-fold connected sum
of projective planes P2# . . . #P2 in the non-orientable case (a sphere with h
cross-caps), denoted Nh. For the remainder of this article, the term surface
refers to a closed connected surface.
A triangulation of a surface S is a two-dimensional simplicial complex ∆
whose underlying topological space |∆| is homeomorphic to S. Two triangles
in ∆ are adjacent if they share an edge. A k-face and a j-face of the simplicial
complex are incident if one is a subset of the other, and a ﬂag is a maximal
chain of mutually incident faces. Euler’s formula states that

χ = f0 − f1 + f2,

where f0, f1,f2 are the numbers of vertices (0-faces), edges (1-faces), and
faces (2-faces), respectively. For triangulations, we have 3f2 = 2f1. A trian-
gulation of a surface with Euler characteristic χ requires at least

vertices according to Heawood [Hea90]. This bound was shown to be tight
for all surfaces by Ringel [Rin55] and Jungerman and Ringel [JR80], with
the only exceptions being the orientable surface M2 and the non-orientable
surfaces N2 and N3, all of which need one extra vertex.

It is a well-known fact from topology that orientable surfaces can be
smoothly embedded into R3, whereas non-orientable surfaces cannot. How-
ever, non-orientable surfaces can be smoothly immersed into R3.
The analogous polyhedral version of this question is much harder to de-
cide. Let ∆ be a triangulation of a surface S = |∆|, and let V be the set of
vertices. Each assignment ψ : V → R3 of coordinates to the set of vertices
induces a simplexwise linear map φψ:|∆| → R3. By the terms polyhedral

4

realization or geometric realization of ∆ we mean an injective map φψ, i.e.,
a simplex-wise linear embedding, if S is orientable, and a locally injective
map φψ, i.e., a simplex-wise linear immersion, if S is non-orientable. In both
cases, local injectivity assures that i-dimensional faces of ∆ are mapped to
ﬂat, i-dimensional simplices in R3 (points, line segments, and triangles).

Polyhedral realizations of triangulated surfaces are interesting objects
from the geometric, topological and combinatorial point of view. Since
smooth surfaces can easily be discretized when allowing many vertices, real-
izations of triangulations with few or the minimal number of vertices present
a greater challenge, and are thus of particular interest.

3 An Adapted Search Heuristic

We will now present the basic structure of the adapted algorithm, reviewing
the approach in [HLZ10]. Throughout this section, φψ always denotes a
simplexwise linear map induced by a coordinate assignment on the vertices,
ψ: V → Z3. Note that the coordinates, for the purpose of computational
treatment, are integral. Whether we mean the vertices, edges or triangles in
the triangulation or whether we mean their images in R3 can be derived from
context.

Comprehensive text ﬁles detailing (up to isomorphism) all possible trian-
gulations of a speciﬁc closed surface with few vertices are readily available
on Lutz’s Manifold Page [Lut16] together with references pointing out their
origins. These combinatorial data were the basis for our systematic search
for realizations.

Hougardy, Lutz, and Zelke [HLZ10] modiﬁed vertex coordinates such that
φψ eventually becomes an embedding, all the while maintaining general po-
sition for the vertices. The goal of our extended algorithm is similar; how-
ever, we want that φψ becomes an embedding for orientable surfaces, and an
immersion for non-orientable surfaces. Furthermore, we would like to incor-
porate symmetry constraints. For these purposes we adapted the objective
function as well as the general position requirement.

3.1 The Objective Function and Descent Step Heuris-

tic

When degenerate intersections are excluded, the intersection of two triangles
is always a line segment, see Figure 1. Summing the lengths of the inter-
section segments for each pair of intersecting triangles, we obtain the value
of the objective function used in [HLZ10]. Note that it is not the absolute

length of the self-intersection in R3, as it cannot be excluded that 3 triangles
intersect in the same line segment. However, if we mark the intersection and
then disassemble the surface into separate triangles, the objective function
measures half of the total length of the markings. In what follows, we make
use of this objective function when searching for embedded realizations, and
we modify it for immersions.

The set of vertices of the triangulation is said to have admissible coordi-
nates if their coordinates are within a bounding box and fulﬁll some position
requirement. A smaller bounding box is used for the initialization, and a
bigger bounding box is used for all subsequent steps, allowing the surface
to expand in the process. The speciﬁc position requirements are detailed in
Subsection 3.2.
A unit move or unit coordinate move is a change of value +1 or −1 in one
of the coordinates of one of the vertices. An admissible step or an admissible
move is a unit coordinate move which maintains admissible coordinates for
the entire set of vertices. The descent step heuristic attempts to ﬁnd a
sequence of decreasing admissible moves. More speciﬁcally, a descent step
consists of the program cycling through the available unit moves in random
order in search of admissible moves. After ﬁnding an admissible move, the
objective function is re-computed. The ﬁrst admissible move found is saved
for the case that none of the admissible moves decrease the objective function.
If a decreasing admissible move is found, it is taken and the program proceeds
to the next descent step.

If no admissible move decreases the objective function, then a local min-
imum has been found. Hougardy et al. [HLZ10] resolved this by using any
admissible move and, in order to avoid endless undetected cycling between
diﬀerent local minima, a time limit was imposed up to which the objective
function had to vanish, or new starting coordinates were set. By contrast,

6

we only impose a maximum number of steps for each triangulation, and
sometimes immediately re-initialize the coordinates when trapped in a local
minimum. Speciﬁcally, if there is no decreasing move but there exists a saved
admissible move, the program decides (pseudo-) randomly based on a given
ratio on whether to take an admissible step or to restart with new coordi-
nates. The step counter is not reset even though the coordinates are, so the
program will eventually abort the search for each triangulation.

3.2 Position Requirements

Numerical problems in calculating the objective function tend to arise from
(near-) degenerate triangles or (near-) degenerate intersections of triangles.
General position of the vertices is the most obvious choice to assure that
triangles in R3 are full-dimensional and only intersect as in Figure 1.
It
can be veriﬁed by conﬁrming aﬃne independence of the coordinates for all
quadruplets of vertices.

However, general position is more restrictive than necessary and would
exclude some types of symmetry. For the purpose of symmetric realizations,
a modiﬁed or relaxed version of the general position requirement for the
vertices was used. In the context of this article, relaxed general position of
ψ(V ) can be characterized by ψ being injective and preventing the degenerate
intersections pictured in Figure 2. Speciﬁcally, if v is a vertex, and abc
is a triangle whose vertices are diﬀerent from v, then φψ(v) = ψ(v) and
φψ(abc) are disjoint, and if ab and cd are edges whose vertices are pairwise
disjoint, then φψ(ab) and φψ(cd) are disjoint. Note that this also prevents
the intersection of triangles in the same plane.

(b) Edges intersecting in
their relative interiors.

We can still safely calculate the objective function, i.e., the self-intersection

7

in R3 is still composed of line segments, while allowing more ﬂexibility in the
position of the vertices. For arbitrary (non-symmetric) polyhedral realiza-
tions, there is no reason for using the relaxed version and thus, also in view
of run-time considerations, we used the simpler condition of ordinary general
position in the program.

As in [HLZ10], integer coordinates are required for the vertices and an
outer bounding box for the coordinates is set. Integer coordinates assure that
rescaling is not necessary as the object cannot shrink to arbitrarily small size,
the calculations are simple, and numerical problems can be avoided. Last
but not least, it is nice to have small integer coordinates for the vertices.
Bounding boxes of a heuristically determined size are introduced for similar
reasons, i.e., numerical safety, speed, limiting the number of (unsuccessful)
search routes, and to obtain small integer coordinates if possible.

3.3 Realizing Non-Orientable Closed Surfaces

3.3.1 A Modiﬁed Objective Function

In order to handle immersions, the simplest modiﬁcation of the objective
function is to only compute the length of those intersection segments that
are contradictory to an immersion. That is, we only sum the lengths of
nontrivial intersections of triangles with a common vertex (see Figure 1 (b)).
Note that adjacent triangles may not intersect (except in their common edge)
because we assure non-degeneracy. We use this altered objective function
with the same descent step procedure as before. It is not a priori clear that
this strategy should yield results, since a self-intersection in the simplicial
neighborhood of a vertex constitutes a pinch point, and pinch points are
usually hard to dissolve, as Cervone [Cer94] pointed out. However, the varied
results in Section 5 conﬁrm this as a suitable choice.

3.3.2 A Simple Obstruction: Triple Points

A result of Banchoﬀ [Ban74] stipulates that the number of triple points of
an immersed non-orientable closed surface in general position has the same
parity as its Euler characteristic. For a surface immersed in 3-space, general
position is the usual notion that distinct disks of the surface may intersect
in 3-space, but transversally to each other and at most three in the same
point (triple point), in topologically the same way as coordinate planes in-
tersect. Furthermore, it is required that there are only ﬁnitely many such
triple points.

Our position requirements ensure transversality for any intersecting disks.

8

It is always possible to perform a small perturbation of the vertices of a given
geometric realization (possibly leaving the integer grid) such that another
geometric realization is induced where no more than three disks intersect in
a point, and three intersecting disks always intersect in the way coordinate
planes do. There must be ﬁnitely many such triple points as there are ﬁnitely
many faces (triangles). Thus a polyhedral realization of a non-orientable
surface can be perturbed into another polyhedral realization such that the
image of the surface is in general position, where it must have at least one
triple point if its Euler characteristic is odd.

Producing a triple point necessitates, at the very least, three disjoint tri-
angles. Moreover, each pair abc, def out of the three vertex-distinct triangles
must be able to intersect in a non-degenerate way, thus exactly two out of
their six combined edges must pierce the respective other triangle. Since
intersections of the triangles incident to the same vertex are prohibited for
immersions, the other triangle adjacent to such a piercing edge may not have
its third vertex in {a, b, c, d, e, f}. Thus the triangles must satisfy the fol-
lowing necessary condition: at most 4 of the 6 triangles adjacent to abc or
def (i.e., sharing an edge) have all three of their vertices in {a, b, c, d, e, f}.
We automatically tested for this condition for triangulated surfaces with odd
Euler characteristic (Cervone [Cer94] used the term edge-cut-analysis for test-
ing similar conditions), and concluded polyhedral non-immersibility in many
cases. Reﬁned topological methods, incorporating the edge-cut analysis, are
used in [Leo09, Leo16b] also for surfaces of even Euler characteristic.

4 Realizations with Symmetries

Triangulations may possess nontrivial automorphisms, and it is natural to
ask which automorphisms of a triangulation ∆ can be realized as geometric
symmetries. In this article, we consider geometric symmetries of the realiza-
tions φψ : |∆| → R3, not merely symmetries of the images. That is, geometric
symmetries are isometries of R3 which ﬁx φψ(|∆|) and are induced by an au-
tomorphism of |∆|. Our goal is thus the realization of symmetries within our
program’s framework, i.e., for vertices chosen in the integer lattice Z3.

Subsets of the integer lattice Z3 in Euclidean R3 are compatible with sev-
eral symmetries, e.g., the reﬂection in a suitable plane (such as the xy-plane)
as well as 2-, 3-, and 4-fold rotation, point symmetry (central inversion), and
some rotatory reﬂections. Higher symmetry can sometimes be achieved by
combining these symmetries. However, numerical problems may arise and,
for high symmetry, initialization of coordinates may not even be possible, so
we kept only a small selection of symmetries to work with. Our program

9

can handle reﬂections in a plane, rotations of order 2, 3, 4, point symmetry
(central inversion), rotatory reﬂections of orders 4 and 6 with angles π
2 and
π
3 , respectively, as well as the dihedral rotation group D2 (three mutually
orthogonal axes of order 2). Note also that our program is targeted towards
surfaces with few vertices, most of which have only few automorphisms to
begin with; moreover, in any case, highly symmetric realizations seem to be
extremely rare in our context.

In order to handle symmetries in our program, a small alteration of the
stepping procedure is necessary. After each coordinate move or choice of
(pseudo-)random coordinates, and before re-evaluating the objective func-
tion, an adaptation function must restore the symmetry. As one vertex is
moved, the positions of the other vertices in the same orbit are adapted ac-
cordingly. However, the overall structure of the descent step heuristic remains
the same, as one can view the symmetry as part of the position requirement.
An automorphism of a triangulation is completely determined by its ac-
tion on one of the 4f1 ﬂags of the triangulation. During pre-processing of each
triangulation, our program checks whether mapping a particular triangle in
any way to any other triangle yields an automorphism, thus enumerating all
of the automorphisms of the triangulation.

In the main program, the non-trivial automorphisms as well as sets of
generators of D2 are tested successively, i.e. an instance of the search (descent
step procedure) is started for each potential geometric realization of these
symmetries. The size of Aut(∆) and the chosen generators are recorded in
the results ﬁle.

The realizability of an automorphism as geometric symmetry depends, for
example, on the vertices, edges, and faces ﬁxed by the given automorphism.
Some considerations are noted in the second author’s diploma thesis [Leo09],
and some necessary conditions have been incorporated into the program, pre-
sorting automorphisms according to their potential geometric realizations.
Thus, only the remaining candidates for geometric symmetry are tested.

Note that we are considering triangulations only and a plane square in R3
consisting of two coplanar adjacent triangles can never have 4-fold symmetry
according to our deﬁnition. Thus, the situation may be slightly diﬀerent
when we allow faces which have more than three vertices; however, for very
few vertices, it seems unlikely that much more symmetric realizations could
be found. For larger |V | = f0, it is best to investigate beforehand which
abstract symmetry groups have a chance of being realized geometrically in a
given triangulation, thereby reducing the number of test cases.

A well-known topological argument is that, generically, a line pierces an
immersed surface in an even number of points. Since we allow singular points
on rotation axes, an odd total number of ﬁxed points by itself is not a criterion

10

by which to exclude a symmetry (for immersions in the case that a rotation
axis passes through a triple point). For related work, see [Tuc14, LT16].

5 New Results for Non-Orientable Surfaces

The results for triangulated non-orientable surfaces will be presented ﬁrst.
Their abundance conﬁrms our modiﬁcation of the objective function as suit-
able for accommodating non-orientable triangulated surfaces. The symmetric
results indicate that symmetries can be realized heuristically as well. All re-
sults, both for the non-orientable and the orientable case, are available on
the second author’s web page [Leo16a]. Unless otherwise stated, all results
were obtained using at most 2000000 search steps (descent steps) per trian-
gulation. For the visualization we used JavaView [jav16].

5.1 Projective Planes

Considering that there has to be an odd number of triple points in a general
position immersion, one easily concludes that rotations of even order cannot
be geometric symmetries of a realization of N1. We were able to generate
many polyhedral realizations of triangulations of the projective plane with
9 vertices, as well as a few with 3-fold rotational symmetry (see also the
examples found by the ﬁrst author [Bre90]). However, for almost as many
triangulations their combinatorial structure prohibits triple points, rendering
geometric realizations impossible.

Theorem 5.1. At least 50 of the 134 triangulations of the projective plane
with 9 vertices are polyhedrally realizable in R3; at least 46 are not, due to
the infeasibility of a triple point. For at least 3 triangulations there exist
polyhedral realizations with a 3-fold rotational symmetry.

For the search, the inner (initial) and outer bounding boxes had side

lengths 40 and 80, respectively.

Triangulations of the projective plane with one additional vertex, i.e. with
10 vertices, were also processed, but only for symmetric realizations. With 60
and 120 for the side lengths of the inner and outer bounding box, we obtained
10 realizations with 3-fold rotational symmetry out of 1210 triangulations
(note that 923 of the triangulations have trivial automorphism groups, see
also [Lut08]).

11

5.2 Klein Bottles

Cervone showed that the vertex-minimal triangulations (using 8 vertices)
are not geometrically realizable, and found some realizations of Klein bottles
with 9 vertices by hand, one of which possessed a 2-fold rotational symmetry.
We were able to considerably expand the list of Cervone’s [Cer94] examples.
The bounding boxes had size 40 (inner) and 80 (outer).

Theorem 5.2. At least 90 of the 187 triangulations of the Klein bottle with 9
vertices are polyhedrally realizable in R3. At least 11 triangulations possess
polyhedral realizations with a 2-fold rotational symmetry.

In the hope of realizing further symmetries, we also tested 10-vertex tri-
angulations of the Klein bottle with larger bounding boxes (side length 60
for the initial inner bounding box, side length 120 for the outer bounding
box) and the same default limit of 2000000 on the search steps. This gave
the following results.

Theorem 5.3. At least 76 of the 4, 462 triangulations of the Klein bottle
with 10 vertices have polyhedral realizations in R3 which realize an involutory
symmetry. In most cases this was a rotational symmetry of order 2, but in 9
cases a reﬂective symmetry could be realized.

Since a true reﬂective symmetry is diﬃcult to realize for triangulations
of surfaces with few vertices (the fact that there are only triangular faces
being one obstruction), this is a rather remarkable result. We picture one
realization in Figure 3.

5.3 Non-Orientable Surfaces of Higher Genus

With the extended algorithm described in this article, realizations of the non-
orientable surfaces of genus 3, 4, 5, and 6 with few or the minimal number
of vertices could be obtained for the ﬁrst time.

First of all, the non-orientable surface N3 of genus 3 admits realizations
with 9 vertices, which is the minimal number of vertices needed for a trian-
gulation due to the Heawood bound mentioned in Section 2. One result of
our search, using at most 8000000 search steps and bounding boxes of sizes
60 (initial) and 120(outer), is shown in Figure 4. We did not ﬁnd any sym-
metric realizations, but note that most (106 out of 133, see also [Lut08]) of
the triangulations possess no nontrivial automorphisms. Note also that not
all triangulations may admit realizations.

12

Figure 3: A realization of N2 with 10 vertices and reﬂective symmetry.

Theorem 5.4. At least 4 of the 133 vertex-minimal 9-vertex triangulations
of the non-orientable surface of genus 3 are polyhedrally realizable in R3. At
least 3 of the 133 triangulations are not polyhedrally realizable in R3 due to
the infeasibility of triple points.

For N4, processing the vertex-minimal triangulations, i.e. triangulations
with 9 vertices, terminated without results. We used inner and outer bound-
ing boxes of size 60 and 120, respectively. For the symmetric search we used
the default maximum of 2000000 search steps, for the asymmetric search we
allowed even 10000000. Still, no results were found and thus it remains an
open problem whether N4 can be realized with the minimal number of 9
vertices. However, by adding one vertex, we were able to obtain some, even
symmetric, realizations for the non-orientable surface of genus 4. We show
one example in Figure 5.

Theorem 5.5. At least 112 of the 13, 657 triangulations of the non-orientable
surface of genus 4 with 10 vertices possess polyhedral realizations in R3 with
2-fold rotational symmetry.

The realizability of some 10-vertex triangulations of the non-orientable
surface of genus 5 is one main result which we would like to highlight in this

(i.e., each pair of distinct vertices is connected with an edge) with 9 vertices
and none with fewer, due to the Heawood bound; however, the second author
proved that these are not geometrically realizable [Leo09, Leo16b], rendering
10 minimal. The edge graph for a triangulation with 10 vertices still has only
6 missing edges. It is thus not only surprising that 10 vertices suﬃce for a
realization, but also, that symmetric realizations exist.

Theorem 5.6. At least 10 of the 7050 triangulations of the non-orientable
surface of genus 5 with 10 vertices admit polyhedral realizations in R3. More-
over, all of the obtained realizations possess a 3-fold rotational symmetry.

All of the realizations took signiﬁcantly less than 200000 search steps,
1
10 of the default limit. The side lengths of the inner (initial) and outer
i.e.
bounding boxes were 60 and 120, respectively. See Figure 6 for an example.

Finally, we investigated vertex-minimal triangulations of N6. One of the
most remarkable results of our paper is that we succeeded in ﬁnding one re-
alization. This was achieved only when searching for symmetric realizations.
This realization is depicted in Figure 7.

Theorem 5.7. At least one of the 1022 triangulations of the non-orientable
surface of genus 6 with the minimal number of 10 vertices has a polyhedral
realization in R3 with 2-fold rotational symmetry.

6 Orientable Surfaces of Higher Genus

The original results in [Lut08, HLZ10], that all 865 vertex-minimal trian-
gulations of the orientable surface of genus 2 are realizable in R3, could be
conﬁrmed. We added to this by showing that several symmetries can be real-
ized. We name the maximal symmetries with respect to each combinatorial
type.

Theorem 6.1. At least 57 of the 865 vertex-minimal 10-vertex triangulations
of the orientable surface of genus 2 have polyhedral realizations in R3 which
realize a non-trivial symmetry. Of these geometric realizations, 46 possess
2-fold rotational symmetry, 7 possess 3-fold rotational symmetry, 2 realize a
rotation-reﬂection of order 4 and 2 realize the dihedral group D2 (Klein Four
group generated by rotations).

As parameters we used the default maximum of 2000000 search steps
and 40 and 80 for the size of the inner (initial) and outer bounding box,
respectively.

The next candidates for symmetry were the realizations of the vertex-
minimal triangulations of the orientable surface of genus 3. Again, the re-
alizability of all 20 vertex-minimal triangulations of the orientable surface
of genus 3 [HLZ10] could be conﬁrmed. Moreover, our algorithm yielded
the following symmetric versions, using an initial (inner) bounding box of
side length of 40 and allowing expansion up to side length 80 for the outer
bounding box.

16

Theorem 6.2. At least 6 of the 20 vertex-minimal 10-vertex triangulations
of the orientable surface of genus 3 have polyhedral realizations in R3 which
realize a symmetry. The maximal realized symmetries are the dihedral group
D2 (3 rotational axes of order 2) for one triangulation, either a rotation of
order 2 or a rotation of order 3 for one triangulation, a rotation of order
3 for one other triangulation, and only a rotation of order 2 for three more
triangulations.

Brehm [Bre87b] showed that the maximal order of the symmetry group is
4 and gave an example with D2 symmetry, and also gave an earlier example
with 2-fold rotational symmetry in [Bre81]. Moreover, the result was proved
in the more general context of polyhedral realization of polyhedral maps, i.e.,
where polygons with more vertices are allowed as faces (merging coplanar
triangles and removing common edges).

Next, the vertex-minimal 11-vertex triangulations of the orientable sur-
face of genus 4 were investigated. Bokowski and Brehm [BB89] previously
showed (again for polyhedral realizations of polyhedral maps) that the only
possible nontrivial symmetry is a rotation of order 2.

Theorem 6.3. At least 28 of the 821 vertex-minimal 11-vertex triangulations
of the orientable surface of genus 4 have polyhedral realizations in R3 with
2-fold rotational symmetry.

This time, we used a higher maximum of 4000000 search steps as well as

inner and outer bounding boxes of side length 60 and 120, respectively.

Finally, we were able to add symmetric versions to the results from
[HLZ10] concerning realizations of 12-vertex triangulations of the orientable
surface M5 of genus 5.

Theorem 6.4. At least 35 of the 751, 593 vertex-minimal 12-vertex triangu-
lations of the orientable surface of genus 5 admit polyhedral realizations in
R3 with 2-fold rotational symmetry.

Figure 8 shows an example. The default of 2000000 search steps was
chosen as the maximal number of steps because of the high number of trian-
gulations and the limited time frame. Several instances of the program ran
independently on diﬀerent portions of the ﬁle, and bounding boxes of size 60
(inner) and 120 (outer) were used. The requirement of geometric symmetry
naturally limited the search to a subset of all 751, 593 triangulations.

7 Final Remarks

We have presented, implemented, and run a search heuristic adapted from
the one given in [HLZ10]. It has proved to be suitable for ﬁnding simplex-
wise linear realizations (i.e., embeddings or immersions) for triangulations of
closed surfaces with few vertices. Our program is also capable of producing
symmetric examples. Note that only small symmetries satisfying certain
conditions have been tested, and the results are not exhaustive. Most of the
results have already been obtained when the second author worked on her
diploma thesis (see [Leo09]) under supervision of the ﬁrst author, and are
published as a paper for the ﬁrst time.

The fact that the search terminates as soon as the intersection functional
has reached zero may cause some pairs of edges to have very small distance.
In the symmetric case, incorporating additional necessary conditions for ge-
ometric symmetries may yield an improvement of the algorithm.

The realizability problem for polyhedral surfaces is algorithmically decid-
able in theory [BS89], yet implementations of the procedure have only been
successful in very speciﬁc cases (such as [BB87, Sch10]). Recently, a reﬁned
approach has been taken by Firsching [Fir15] for the successful realization of
higher-dimensional complexes and spheres, and for proving non-realizability.
The main open problem concerning the minimal number of vertices for
polyhedral realizations of surfaces of small genus is the case N4, where it still
remains unclear if the minimal number of vertices for a realization is 9 or 10.
In all other cases of orientable surfaces of genus up to 5 and non-orientable

18

surfaces of genus up to 6 we have found vertex-minimal realizations. More-
over, in all these cases except for N3 we have found symmetric realizations
and except for N6 we have found several (or many) combinatorially diﬀerent
realizations.

The question whether all triangulations of a certain surface are polyhe-
drally realizable is still open for M2, M3, and M4 (and polyhedral embed-
dings). For non-orientable surfaces and polyedral immersions, Brehm’s result
[Bre83] implies that there are non-realizable examples for any surface Nh.
