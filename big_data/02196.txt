ABSTRACT

The four longest period Kuiper belt objects have orbital periods close to
small integer ratios with each other. A hypothetical planet with orbital period
∼ 17,117 years, semimajor axis ∼ 665 AU, would have N/1 and N/2 period ratios
with these four objects. The orbital geometries and dynamics of resonant orbits
constrain the orbital plane, the orbital eccentricity and the mass of such a planet,
as well as its current location in its orbital path.

1. The most distant Kuiper belt objects

In the outer solar system beyond the orbit of Neptune is a large belt of minor planets,
the Kuiper belt, whose dynamics has been understood, over the past two decades, to be
signiﬁcantly controlled by the gravity of the giant planets, Jupiter—Neptune, either through
secular or resonant perturbations or by gravitational scattering. However, there are a few
known Kuiper belt object [KBOs] that are unlikely to be signiﬁcantly perturbed by the
known giant planets in their current orbits. These objects are of semimajor axis, a, and
perihelion distance, q, exceeding 150 AU and 40 AU, respectively. In these orbits, the closest
approach distance to Neptune is not less than ∼ 10 AU, so large orbital perturbations (under
the inﬂuence of the known giant planets) would be rather unlikely over the age of the solar
system. In the dynamical classiﬁcation scheme for the small bodies of the outer solar system,
such objects would likely belong in a class known as “detached objects”, distinct from the
classical KBOs, the resonant KBOs and the scattered/scattering KBOs (Gladman et al.
2008). Trujillo & Sheppard (2014) call them “extreme” KBOs [eKBOs, henceforth]. Upon

querying the Minor Planet Center’s catalog, we identify six KBOs having a > 150 AU and
q > 40 AU; two of these are numbered and four are unnumbered: Sedna (90377), 2010
GB174, 2004 VN112, 2012 VP113, (148209), 2013 GP136. Their orbital inclinations are in
the range 11.9–33.5 degrees (to the ecliptic), not especially remarkable for KBOs. However
all of these objects have extremely large orbital eccentricity, e (cid:38) 0.7, suggesting large orbital
perturbation in their past history. This is rather at odds with their current large separations
from the known giant planets.

A natural hypothesis is that these objects’ orbital dynamics were or are dominated by the
gravitational perturbations of a planet in the heliocentric distance range of a few hundred
AU. Gladman & Chan (2006) hypothesized a “rogue” planet, a short-lived planet larger
than an earth-mass, to explain the eKBOs. Trujillo & Sheppard (2014) proposed an extant
hypothetical distant planet to explain an apparent clustering of the arguments of perihelion
of the distant KBOs. Batygin & Brown (2016) have also argued for this hypothesis by calling
attention to the clustering of the eccentricity vectors of some distant KBOs; they additionally
argue that such a planet could also account for a previously observed but puzzling population
of high inclination Centaurs. These authors suggest a planet mass of ∼ 10M⊕, and an orbit
with semimajor axis a (cid:39) 700 AU, and eccentricity e (cid:39) 0.6, but they do not describe how
constrained these parameters are by the dynamics of the observed distant KBOs.

Here we report additional support for the extant distant planet hypothesis, and we nar-
row the range of its parameters and its current location. We point out hitherto unnoticed
peculiarities of the orbits of the eKBOs mentioned above: we ﬁnd that the orbital period
ratios of these objects are close to integer ratios. This helps us identify a particular orbital
period of the hypothetical planet which is in simple integer ratios with the four most distant
eKBOs. That is, we identify mean motion resonances between these eKBOs and the hy-
pothetical planet. We show that the resonant dynamics provide constraints on the planet’s
orbital parameters and its mass and can also narrow the possible range of its current location
in its orbital path.

2. Mean motion resonances

If such a planet exists, then the wide range of the perihelion–to-aphelion distances of
each eKBO may overlap those of the hypothetical planet [HP, henceforth]. In this circum-
stance, the extreme eccentricities of the eKBOs may be a natural consequence of gravitational
scattering encounters with the planet. The dynamical survival of scattered objects over solar
system age could be simply due to the long timescales of close encounters at these distances,
or it could be due to enhanced dynamical stability oﬀered by phase-locking in mean mo-

– 3 –

tion resonances with HP. Here we explore the possibility of mean motion resonances; in
future work it would be useful to explore scattering eﬃciency, dynamical lifetimes, and other
considerations.

One symptom of mean motion resonances would be that the orbital period ratios of the
eKBOs, amongst themselves, should also be close to small integer ratios. Examining the
orbital periods of the six eKBOs as listed in the Minor Planet Center’s catalog, and ordering
them in order of decreasing orbital period (so Sedna is eKBO#1, with the longest period
orbit), here is what we ﬁnd for the ratios P1/Pj:

1.596, 1.993, 2.666, 3.303, 6.115.

These values are close to the following rational ratios: 8/5, 2/1, 8/3, 10/3, and 6/1, suﬃ-
ciently intriguing to investigate further.

Unfortunately, the Minor Planet Center does not report orbital parameter uncertainties,
so we proceeded as follows. We computed the best-ﬁt orbits for these six eKBOs, as well
as their uncertainties, using the orbit-ﬁtting software developed by Bernstein & Khushalani
(2000); for these orbit-ﬁts, we included all of the astrometric measurements for the objects
listed in the Minor Planet Center. We ﬁnd the following best-ﬁt semimajor axes and their
1–σ uncertainties (all quoted in AU):

506.84 ± 0.51, 350.7 ± 4.7, 319.6 ± 6.0, 265.8 ± 3.3, 221.59 ± 0.16, 149.84 ± 0.47.

The orbital periods calculated from these diﬀer somewhat from those listed in the Minor
Planet Center’s catalog. This diﬀerence is due to the fact that the MPC orbits are presented
in osculating heliocentric orbital elements, whereas ours are osculating barycentric elements.
For very distant objects, osculating heliocentric elements will undergo large ﬂuctuations on
orbital timescales because the velocity of the sun around the solar system’s barycenter is
an appreciable fraction of the orbital velocities of the distant objects. Thus the current
osculating heliocentric semimajor axis for an eKBO can be several AU larger or smaller than
its orbit-averaged value. The osculating barycentric elements eliminate these ﬂuctuations
and yield a better representative semimajor axis value. Our barycentric orbit ﬁts agree well
with the heliocentric MPC orbits when both are converted to heliocentric cartesian positions
and velocities.

With our computed orbital periods and uncertainties, we consider some simple possi-
bilities for HP’s resonant orbit. Assume that its orbital period P (cid:48) is longer than P1, but not
by too much, else its gravitational eﬀects would not be very strong. So, we consider P (cid:48)/P1
values of 2/1 or 3/2 or 4/3. We ﬁnd that the case of P (cid:48)/P1 = 3/2 is particularly striking,
for it yields period ratios close to 5/2, 3/1, and 4/1 for P2, P3 and P4.

– 4 –

Fig. 1.— Period ratios of the six eKBOs with the hypothetical planet. The errorbars indicate 3–σ uncertainties.
The orbit period P (cid:48) of HP is assumed to be 3/2 times Sedna’s best-ﬁt orbital period, P1 = 11,411 years. The
dotted horizontal lines indicate the rational ratios 3/2, 5/2, 3/1 4/1, 5/1 and 9/1.

In Fig. 1, we plot the period ratios P (cid:48)/Pj for the best-ﬁt orbits with their uncertainties.
We observe that, within 3–σ uncertainties, four of the six eKBOs have periods near N/1 or
N/2 ratios with HP, when we take the latter’s period to be 1.5 times Sedna’s best-ﬁt period.
We also observe that the error bars are not insubstantial and one can be skeptical of any
perceived coincidence with simple ratios. We remark that our procedure for computing the
uncertainties weights all published observations equally and may result in more conservative
estimates than the true errors. (The Minor Planet Center presumably employs a sensible
weighting scheme depending upon the quality of the observational data, so perhaps one might
have more conﬁdence in their best-ﬁt parameters than in our error estimates; however the
Minor Planet Center does not report uncertainties.) Secondly, one might also be skeptical of
the period ratio coincidences because not all possible N/1 and N/2 period ratios in the range
shown are represented in the observed eKBO population. On this point, we can remark that
(a) the larger N values lead to shorter period orbits in which HP’s inﬂuence is diminished
and Neptune’s inﬂuence looms larger, potentially destabilizing the resonances with HP, and

(b) observational biases limit the current known population of eKBOs to the small number
mentioned above, so this small number will select only a small fraction of all possible N/1,
N/2 period ratios. Despite these reservations, we will proceed with exploring the implications
of the mean motion resonances for the four longest period eKBOs. We show later (Section
2.2) that the uncertainties in the orbital periods are comparable to the resonance widths
deﬁned by a planet of a few earth-masses, providing support for the conjecture of mean
motion resonances.

The dynamics of orbital resonances in the high eccentricity regime has not been as well
studied as the low eccentricity regime. One of the few studies on this topic is by Pan & Sari
(2004) who noted that N/1 and N/2 are the strongest resonances for high eccentricity orbits,
albeit their study was limited to exterior resonances in the circular planar restricted three
body problem. Thus encouraged that the period ratios may be dynamically signiﬁcant, we
proceed with examining in more detail the resonant planet hypothesis, with the orbit period
of the planet equal to 3/2 times that of Sedna’s orbital period.

Fig. 2.— Resonant orbits in the rotating frame are in black. The red loops indicate the trace of HP in possible
eccentric orbits. Distances are scaled to the semimajor axis of HP. The grey circle is of unit radius.

The planet’s orbital period being 3/2 times Sedna’s orbital period means that the orbit

has semimajor axis a(cid:48) ≈ 665 AU.

2.1. Resonant orbital geometry constraints

As mentioned above, the high orbital eccentricities of the eKBOs imply that their aphe-
lion distances may approach the orbit of HP. Indeed, two of the eKBOs, Sedna and 2010
GB174, have aphelion distances exceeding a(cid:48), which means that even a circular orbit of HP
would overlap these objects’ perihelion-to-aphelion distance range. Stable resonant orbits
of the eKBOs will avoid close approaches with HP, and will have a discrete number of ge-
ometries for the conjunctions of the eKBO with the planet. The conjunction longitudes are
described by the equilibrium points of the critical resonant angle,

φ = (p + q)λ(cid:48) − pλ − q.

(1)

As usual, in the deﬁnition of the resonant angle, p and q are integers, λ are the mean
longitudes and  are the longitudes of perihelion; we use the prime to refer to orbital
parameters of the planet, the parameters of the eKBO are unprimed. Depending upon the
orbital eccentricity, φ may be stable at either 0 or at π or at both. For orbits that are near-
resonant,

˙φ describes the rate of drift of the conjunctions from the equilibrium locations.

We illustrate in Fig. 2 the trace of the resonant orbits (of zero libration amplitude) in
the frame co-rotating with the mean angular velocity of HP. Also included in the plots in
Fig. 2 is the trace of a few possible coplanar orbits of HP, with eccentricity e(cid:48) = 0, 0.17 and
0.4.

Examining the coplanar orbital geometries traced in Fig. 2, we observe that for Sedna,
stable libration is likely only near φ = π, and unlikely near φ = 0, because the latter would
allow rather small encounter distances. (This means that conjunctions with HP occur near
one of three longitudes, ±π/3 and π from Sedna’s longitude of perihelion.) Moreover, the
long term stability of Sedna would limit e(cid:48) (cid:46) 0.41. Likewise, a coplanar orbit of 2010 GB174
with φ = π limits e(cid:48) < 0.04; however, in the geometry with φ = 0, the limit is e(cid:48) (cid:46) 0.18. The
orbit of 2004 VN112 limits e(cid:48) (cid:46) 0.42 for φ = π. These limits on e(cid:48) are based simply on the
orbital geometries, and do not account for the perturbing inﬂuence of the planet. Accounting
for the planet mass would (a) limit the stable libration centers to φ = π, 0, π, 0 for Sedna
(90377), 2010 GB174, 2004 VN112, 2012 VP113, respectively, and (b) further depress these
upper limits derived for e(cid:48).

Of course, strict coplanarity of HP is possible for at most one eKBO, because the eKBOs’
orbits are not coplanar. Fig. 3 shows the ecliptic latitude and longitude of the unit normal
vectors of the orbit planes of each of the four potentially resonant eKBOs. We see that they
are somewhat clustered, approximately within one quadrant of ecliptic longitudes; they have
relative inclinations 7–15 degrees to their mean plane.

– 7 –

The non-coplanarity of the orbits with HP’s orbit plane may relax the upper limit on
e(cid:48), especially if the eKBO’s argument of perihelion g (relative to HP’s orbit plane) were near
±90◦. This would have the eﬀect of lifting the eKBO’s aphelion away from the HP orbit plane
and thereby increasing the closest approach distances and enhancing dynamical stability3.
Such a conﬁguration is associated with the so-called “periodic orbits of the third kind”
envisioned by Henri Poincar´e (as noted by Jeﬀerys (1966a)) and computed by Jeﬀerys (1966b)
Kozai (1969) and Jeﬀerys & Standish (1972) for the three dimensional circular restricted
three body problem. Such periodic orbits are characterized by simultaneous stationarity of
the resonant angle φ (at 0 or π) and of the argument of perihelion g (at 0 or π or ±π/2).
Physically, we can visualize these periodic orbits as having a ﬁxed orbit plane and a ﬁxed
eccentricity vector (i.e., the apsidal precession rates of both node and pericenter vanish).
In the particular case of g = ±π/2, the particle reaches aphelion when it is at its largest
excursion away from the plane of the planet.

We computed the values of g relative to the mean plane of the four longest period

eKBOs, ﬁnding that they are

145.4◦,−70.4◦, 12.0◦,−39.3◦.

We look for an alternative HP orbit plane for which g is proximate to ±90◦, within some
speciﬁed tolerance, for all of the four eKBOs (Sedna (90377), 2010 GB174, 2004 VN112, 2012
VP113, (148209)). We proceed as follows. Let ˆn be the (unknown) unit vector normal to the
HP orbit plane. Let ˆcj be the unit vector in the orbit plane of an eKBO and normal to its
eccentricity vector. We ask whether ˆcj can be rotated by no more than a speciﬁed amount,
∆ω, in the eKBO’s orbit plane, such that ˆn · ˆcj changes sign; if so, this would indicate that
the eKBO has g within ∆ω of ±π/2, near the periodic orbit of the 3rd kind. By demanding
that all four eKBOs satisfy this constraint, we identify the range of possible ˆn. The results
of this search are shown in Fig. 3, in which we plot in grey the ecliptic longitude and latitude
of the allowed ˆn’s for ∆ω = 45◦.

We can narrow the possible HP planes further by examining the inclinations of the
eKBOs to the possible HP orbit plane: the periodic orbits of the 3rd kind require a spe-
ciﬁc relationship between eccentricity and inclination. Consulting the results of Jeﬀerys &
Standish (1972), we sought stationary values of the inclinations of the periodic orbit of the
3rd kind for each possible combination of stationary values of φ and for g = ±π/2, for

3This geometry is reminiscent of the dynamics of Pluto’s orbit, which librates in an exterior 3/2 mean
motion resonance with Neptune; Pluto’s argument of perihelion is presently ∼ 104◦, and it librates about
90◦ with a period of about 4 megayears (Malhotra & Williams 1997).

four potentially resonant eKBOs are indicated by the black dots. The red dot indicates their mean plane. The

region shaded in grey identiﬁes the planes for which the four eKBOs have g within 45 degrees of ±π/2. The

region shaded in magenta identiﬁes the subset for which the relative inclinations of the eKBOs are also within 10

degrees of the stationary inclination values at the periodic orbit of the third kind.

the observed eccentricities of the eKBOs. The relevant inclinations (relative to HP’s orbit
plane) are 49◦, 62◦, 54◦, and 57◦, respectively. Of course, these eKBOs are likely librating
with non-zero amplitude about the exact periodic orbit, so we look for those ˆn’s that yield
relative inclinations within 10◦ of these values. Carrying out this search, we ﬁnd the range
indicated in magenta in Fig. 3 satisﬁes this constraint. We conclude that an HP orbit plane
with inclination near i ≈ 48◦ and longitude of ascending node near Ω ≈ −5◦ allows all four
resonant eKBOs to be in proximity of the periodic orbits of the third kind.

2.2. Planet mass

Unless the resonant restoring torque from the planet is large enough, it is evident that
even at exact resonance, the conjunctions of an eKBO and HP will drift slowly under secular
planetary perturbations, eventually destroying the resonant geometry. Let λc be one of the

longitudes of conjunction of a resonant eKBO with HP. The rate of drift of λc is given by

where δn = n − (p + q)n(cid:48)/p is the diﬀerence of the eKBO’s mean motion from the exact

where i is the eKBO’s inclination relative to the mean plane of the solar system, and the sum
is over all the perturbing planets. The secular eﬀects of Jupiter–Neptune on the four eKBOs
of interest induce apsidal precession at a quite small rate, 2.3–9.7 radians per gigayear.
The weakness of the eﬀects of the known giant planets for the eKBOs means that the
hypothetical planet in closer proximity to these eKBOs could have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
their dynamics, particularly near mean motion resonances.

The resonant perturbations from HP can halt the drift of conjunctions provided the
eKBO is suﬃciently close to the exact resonant orbit. How close is close enough? We now
quantify this condition.

Here the ﬁrst equation gives the Newtonian perturbation potential (r, r(cid:48) are the position
vectors of an eKBO and of HP, respectively, in Jacobi coordinates (e.g., Brouwer & Clemence
1961); i.e., they are relative to the barycenter of the Sun and the known planets), whereas
the second equation gives an approximation for the resonant perturbation. By physical
considerations, the dependence of the resonant perturbation on the canonical variables can be

– 10 –

expressed as a product of an amplitude A(L, G, H) which is a function of only the canonical
momenta, and a phase C(φ) which is an even function of the critical resonant angle. (A
also has implicit dependence on the orbital semimajor axis, eccentricity and inclination of
HP, which will be assumed to be constants.) Without loss of generality, we can deﬁne A
and C such that |C(φ)| < 1 for 0 ≤ φ < 2π. For the well-studied case of low eccentricity
resonant orbits, A ∼ e|q| (e.g., Murray & Dermott (1999)), but for the eKBOs whose extreme
eccentricities are near unity, the magnitude of A will be of order a few. When we require
numerical values (below), we will adopt A = 3; but this value can, in principle, be determined
more accurately with numerical averaging of the perturbation potential for each case of
resonance.

The mean motion of the eKBO is n = (GM(cid:12))2/L3. Therefore, the resonant pertur-
bations of the mean motion are given by ˙n = −(3pn/L)∂Hpert/∂φ, whence we obtain the
following equation of motion for φ,

2 pn.

(10)

For the resonances of interest, the corresponding libration periods are on the order of a few
megayears for a few-earth-mass planet.

By analogy with the pendulum, we divine that φ (hence the conjunction longitudes λc)
can execute librations about stable equilibrium points provided | ˙φ| = |pδn + q ˙| (cid:46) 2ω0.
Thus the required condition for resonance is that the deviation of the mean motion of the
eKBO from the exact resonant value, (p + q)n(cid:48)/p, should not exceed ∼ 2ω0/p. Then, by
Kepler’s third law, the resonance width in semimajor axis is given by

∆ares (cid:39) a|16m(cid:48)aA

(11)

Computing the widths of the 3/2, 5/2, 3/1 and 4/1 resonances for the four eKBOs of interest,
we ﬁnd that a 10M⊕ planet yields ∆ares values comparable to the 1–σ uncertainties in the
semimajor axes of these objects. Even a one-Earth mass planet has a resonance width far
exceeding that of Sedna’s semimajor axis uncertainty; however, such a low mass planet would
not cover in its resonance widths the uncertainty range of the semimajor axes of the other
three eKBOs.

– 11 –

The more severe condition on the planet mass obtains when we demand that the eKBOs
are in libration about periodic orbits of the third kind. The frequency of small amplitude
oscillations about these periodic orbits4 is given by

where n, a, e, i are a resonant eKBO’s mean motion, semimajor axis, eccentricity and incli-
1 − e(cid:48)2 is the planet’s semi-minor axis, and c
is a numerical coeﬃcient whose asymptotic value is ∼ 5.8 for a (cid:28) a(cid:48) (c will be larger for a
approaching a(cid:48)). For numerical estimates, we adopt e(cid:48) = 0.2 and c = 8. We ﬁnd that, for
m(cid:48) = 10M⊕, the small amplitude oscillation periods for the four eKBOs are 0.6–0.94 Gyr, a
factor of a few smaller than the age of the solar system. We conclude that ∼ 10M⊕ is the
minimum mass necessary to maintain periodic orbits of the third kind for the four eKBOs.

(12)

2.3. Planet’s current location in its orbit

Each resonant eKBO constrains the longitude of HP because the critical resonant angle
must librate about either 0 or 180◦. For illustration, consider the libration of φ = 3λ(cid:48)−2λ−
about 180◦ for Sedna’s 3/2 resonant orbit. Given that Sedna is presently near its perihelion,
λ ≈ , the planet can be in proximity to one of three longitudes: 60◦ or 180◦ or 300◦
from Sedna’s longitude of perihelion, . We ﬁnd from the trace of the resonant orbit in
the rotating frame (Fig. 2) that large amplitude stable librations of φ are possible such the
planet may be located as far as ∼ 54◦ from these longitudes. This means that only three
small zones of ±6◦ around each of three locations, ,  + 120◦ and − 120◦ are excluded for
the planet’s present location. For e(cid:48) = 0.2, we ﬁnd that the excluded zone is a little larger,
±7.5◦ around each of the same three locations.

However, these are simple geometric estimates which deﬁne exclusion zones only for
those resonant eKBOs whose aphelion distance exceeds the perihelion distance of HP, so only
Sedna and 2010 GB174 qualify to deﬁne exclusion zones. The true exclusion zones could be
larger because of the planet’s gravity, which could limit the stable libration amplitude ranges
of the resonant angles to signiﬁcantly less than 180◦ if the resonant separatrices were chaotic.
For example, for eccentric Plutinos (typical eccentricities ∼ 0.2) in the exterior 3/2 mean
motion resonance with Neptune, numerical analysis ﬁnds that the libration of the resonant

4These periodic orbits embedded in the N/1 or N/2 mean motion resonances can be considered to be the
discrete sequence whose limit for N (cid:29) 1 is the well known Kozai-Lidov resonance (Kozai 1962; Lidov 1962).
Eq. 12 is obtained in this limit.

angle is limited to ∆φmax (cid:46) 130◦ owing to the presence of a large chaotic separatrix (Levison
& Stern 1995; Malhotra 1996; Morbidelli 1997; Tiscareno & Malhotra 2009).

In order to make a rough estimate of the eﬀects of the planet’s gravity on the resonant
libration zone, we computed surfaces-of-section for the circular planar restricted three body
problem, for several values of the planet mass in the range of 10−6M(cid:12) to 10−3M(cid:12), for
the neighborhood of the 3/2, 5/2, 3/1 and 4/1 mean motion resonances and the extreme
eccentricities of the four eKBOs (0.85, 0.87, 0.85 and 0.7, respectively). Fig. 4 shows a
sample of these for planet mass 3 × 10−5M(cid:12) (approximately 10M⊕). From such surfaces-of-
section, we conﬁrm the most likely libration centers for each resonant orbit that we argued for
previously (Section 2.1) on physical grounds, namely, (3/2, φ = π), (5/2, φ = 0), (3/1, φ = π),
(4/1, φ = 0). In the surfaces-of-section, we observe two other centers (φ = 0 for the 3/2 and
φ = π for the 5/2) that support small stable islands, but these are vulnerable to collapse
under unmodelled perturbations. We determine the range of excluded longitudes of the
planet by measuring the complement of the large libration zones in these surfaces-of-section

for the 3/2 and 5/2 mean motion resonances. We also conservatively exclude a small range,
±5◦, around the homoclinic points of the 3/1 and 4/1 resonant eKBOs. Fig. 5 shows our
estimates of the excluded zones, projected on the ecliptic latitude and longitude plane, for a
planet of mass 3× 10−5M(cid:12); we plot a representative case of the planet’s low inclination orbit
(in green) and also a representative case of its high inclination orbit (in red). (Note that a
range of orbital planes near each of these representative cases is allowed by our calculations.)
We ﬁnd that approximately half of the ecliptic longitudes are excluded in both cases; the
excluded zone is not contiguous.

3. Summary and Discussion

We noticed that the four known longest period KBOs (Sedna (90377), 2010 GB174,
2004 VN112, 2012 VP113) have orbital period ratios close to small integers. A hypothetical
distant planet in an orbit of period P (cid:48) (cid:39) 17,117 years, semimajor axis a(cid:48) (cid:39) 665 AU, would
have N/1 and N/2 period ratios with these four eKBOs. There are many possibilities for the
other orbital parameters and of the mass of such a planet. In the present work, we have given
a broad sketch of how resonant geometries and resonant dynamics of these high eccentricity
KBOs help narrow the range of planet parameters; many details in this analysis would beneﬁt
from deeper investigation in future work and potentially improve the parameter constraints
further.

Our calculations suggest two possibilities for the planet’s orbit plane: a plane moderately
close to the ecliptic and near the mean plane of the four eKBOs, with inclination and
longitude of node (i (cid:39) 18◦, Ω (cid:39) −79◦), or an inclined plane, of inclination and longitude of
node near (i (cid:39) 48◦, Ω (cid:39) −5◦). The former oﬀers dynamical stability of the four eKBOs by
means of libration of the critical resonant angles of N/1 or N/2 mean motion resonances, and
the latter would oﬀer enhanced dynamical stability by means of additional libration of the
argument of perihelion associated with periodic orbits of the third kind (a class of periodic
orbits of the three dimensional restricted three body problem).

The planet’s orbital eccentricity is limited to e(cid:48) (cid:46) 0.18 in the low inclination case in
which the eKBOs are approximately coplanar with the hypothetical planet’s orbit. The
eccentricity may be larger for the inclined orbit case; we do not obtain a strict upper limit
on the planet’s eccentricity in the inclined orbit case. Future numerical analysis to investigate
the stability of the periodic orbits of the third kind for eccentric planets may provide such a
limit.

A planet mass of ∼ 10M⊕ deﬁnes resonance widths of magnitude similar to the un-
certainties of the orbital periods of the observed eKBOs. Such a planet mass would deﬁne
resonant libration periods on the order of a few megayears, much shorter than the age of the
solar system. Both these estimates support the conjecture that the period ratio coincidences
are of dynamical signiﬁcance. In the case of the inclined planet orbit, a planet of (cid:38) 10M⊕
also supports librations about the periodic orbits of the third kind, with libration periods
signiﬁcantly shorter than the age of the solar system.

We determined exclusion zones of the current location of the planet in its orbital path
(Fig. 5), based on the resonant orbital geometry constraints from all four eKBOs; these
exclude just over half of the orbital path, assuming a 10M⊕ planet. Larger and smaller
planet masses would exclude slightly larger or smaller regions, respectively.

Our analysis supports the distant planet hypothesis, but should not be considered deﬁni-
tive proof of its existence. The orbital period ratios have signiﬁcant uncertainties, so the
near-coincidences with N/1 and N/2 ratios may simply be by chance for a small number
of bodies. The long orbital timescales in this region of the outer solar system may allow
formally unstable orbits to persist for very long times, possibly even to the age of the solar
system, depending on the planet mass; if so, this would weaken the argument for a resonant
planet orbit. It would be pertinent to examine this question quantitatively in future work.
Nevertheless, the possibility that resonant orbital relations could be a useful aid to prediction
and discovery of additional high mass planets in the distant solar system makes a stimulating
case for renewed study of aspects of solar system dynamics, such as resonant dynamics in
the high eccentricity regime, which have hitherto garnered insuﬃcient attention.
