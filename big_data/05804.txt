quadratic nonlinear crystals

Bright and broadband coherent mid-IR radiation is important for exciting and probing molecular vibrations.
Using cascaded nonlinearities in conventional quadratic nonlinear crystal like lithium niobate, self-defocusing
near-IR solitons have been demonstrated that led to very broadband supercontinuum generation in the visible,
near-IR and short-wavelength mid-IR. Here we conduct an experiment where a mid-IR crystal pumped in
the mid-IR gives multiple-octave spanning supercontinua. The crystal is cut for noncritical interaction, so the
three-wave mixing of a single mid-IR femtosecond pump source leads to highly phase-mismatched second-
harmonic generation. This self-acting cascaded process leads to the formation of a self-defocusing soliton at
the mid-IR pump wavelength and after the self-compression point multiple octave-spanning supercontinua are
observed (covering 1.6-7.0 µm). The results were recorded in a commercially available crystal LiInS2 pumped
in the 3-4 µm range, but other mid-IR crystals can readily be used as well.

I.

INTRODUCTION

High-power supercontinuum (SC) sources1 are laser
pulses that have achieved octave-spanning broadened
spectra by passing the laser through a bulk nonlinear
medium. They are widely used in spectroscopy as broad-
band ”white-light” probes that in a single shot can as-
sess a wide range of frequencies. The mid-infrared (mid-
IR) range, spanning from 3.0-20.0 µm holds a tremen-
dous scientiﬁc and technological potential. It contains the
fundamental frequencies of vibrational stretching modes
of the important C-H, O-H and N-H bonds that lie in
the 2.5-3.5 µm wavelength range, and the carbon dou-
blet and triplets in the 4-7 µm range. From 7-20 µm lies
the so-called ﬁngerprint region where all organic com-
pounds have a unique spectral absorption pattern due
to single-bond bending modes. With a broadband mid-
IR SC source the vibrational modes can be probed with
femtosecond resolution2.

Unlike most ﬁber-based SC sources, which rely on
soliton formation3, the bulk SC source relies mainly on
broadening induced by self-phase modulation (SPM). At
high powers a ﬁlament is created by the intense laser
pulse. This happens because the beam experiences focus-
ing to a small spot by the nonlinear self-focusing Kerr-
lens eﬀect that arises because the Kerr nonlinear refrac-
tive index is positive. Filamentation is often undesirable
as it can lead to a spatially incoherent beam. However,
under controlled circumstances a so-called white-light
continuum (WLC) can be generated. In a WLC typi-
cally a single ﬁlament is created ensuring a good spatial
coherence. Both the SPM-induced broadening and the
WLC techniques are widely used in the near-IR but lit-
tle has been done in the mid-IR: Broadband continua
were found when pumping with mid-IR pulses through

a)moba@fotonik.dtu.dk; www.fotonik.dtu.dk/uno

SPM alone (i.e. before ﬁlamentation set in)4–6, which is
limited in energy by onset of small-scale ﬁlamentation,
or by generating a WLC by an increased peak power7–11.
Alternatively one may start with a femtosecond near-IR
source and mix the frequency-converted harmonics in air
and use four-wave mixing to achieve broadband mid-IR
radiation12,13, but with a very low yield.

Finally, supercontinuum generation has also been ob-
served in bulk quadratic nonlinear crystals14–17 and
waveguides18–20. Around phase-matching the pump spec-
tral broadening is accompanied by second-harmonic gen-
eration, which adds to the spectral bandwidth. How-
ever, even when tuning away from SHG phase matching
(∆k = k2 − 2k1 6= 0) the spectral broadening can become
surprisingly large. This has two likely explanations: 1)
the SPM initiated continuum around the pump can mix
through sum-frequency generation (SFG) with the pump.
2) The phase-mismatched SHG process generates a ”cas-
caded” SPM-like cubic nonlinearity n2,casc ∝ −d2
eﬀ /∆k.
This contributes to the material Kerr SPM nonlinearity,
n2,Kerr, which is self-focusing, to give an overall eﬀective
nonlinearity n2,eﬀ = n2,casc +n2,Kerr. For ∆k < 0 the cas-
caded eﬀect is also self-focusing, so the supercontinuum
is in bulk often accompanied by ﬁlamentation.

We recently21 showed that for ∆k > 0 i.e. when the
cascaded eﬀect is self-defocusing, the n2,eﬀ > 0 condi-
tion can be met so the supercontinuum is ﬁlamentation
free, and the spectral broadening is very large because it
is possible to excite solitons when pumping in the nor-
mal dispersion regime. An octave-spanning spectrum was
recorded in bulk lithium niobate (LN) by pumping well
below its zero-dispersion wavelength (ZDW), and akin to
the ﬁlamentation approach almost all of the energy is a
transferred into the supercontinuum.

LN is particularly interesting because it exploits ”non-
critical” ee → e three-wave mixing to achieve cascad-
ing through the large diagonal quadratic nonlinear tensor
component (d33 ≃ 25 pm/V), and this has the additional
advantage of zero spatial walk-oﬀ to the second-harmonic

(SH). Here we show that multiple-octave spanning mid-
IR supercontinua can be generated in a crystal similar
to LN but transparent in most of the mid-IR. We re-
cently showed that many LN-like crystals exist in the
mid-IR, i.e. with large quadratic tensor components and
noncritical interaction, that can be exploited in much the
same way except a mid-IR femtosecond pump laser must
be used22. The present paper is the ﬁrst experimental
realization of these predictions, and we chose to study
the crystal lithium thioindate (LiInS2, LIS). We show
that when pumped with ∼ 50 µJ sub-100 fs pulses from
3.0 − 3.9 µm around its ZDW, LIS gives supercontinua
spanning well over 2 octaves. Importantly the spectra are
broad enough to cover the range 2.5-6.0 µm in a single
pulse, which is important to probe fundamental vibra-
tions of OH, CH, NH, OD, metallic CO and organic CO
bonds, all in a single pulse.

II. BACKGROUND

Cascaded nonlinearities were noted long ago23, where a
basic theoretical treatment predicted that under strongly
phase-mismatched parametric interaction, the pump
pulse may experience self-action, i.e. self-phase modula-
tion of the spectrum. This is because for the simplest case
of second-harmonic generation (SHG), the strong phase
mismatch |∆k| ≫ 0 implies that the pump at ω1 will
be partially upconverted to the second harmonic (SH)
at ω2 = 2ω1 within a coherence length lcoh = |∆k|/π,
but after another coherence length the SH photons will
be back converted to the pump. Under the strong phase-
mismatch limit (|∆k|L ≫ 2π), lcoh is much shorter than
the crystal length L, so this up- and down-conversion
process happens multiple times: this is the reason it is
called a cascaded nonlinearity. The cascaded nonlinear-
ity was ﬁrst experimentally veriﬁed in24, where the cas-
caded nonlinearity was shown to be tunable in sign and
strength n2,casc ∝ −d2
eﬀ /∆k, and where importantly it
became clear that a self-defocusing eﬀect was accessible
(n2,casc < 0, requiring ∆k > 0).

A controllable leading-order self-defocusing nonlinear-
ity is quite unique, and quite some eﬀort was therefore
invested in applications of this eﬀect in bulk crystals. One
application was pulse compression of energetic pulses, be-
cause in bulk glasses the required spectral broadening
was accompanied by self-focusing, limiting the pulse en-
ergy. The idea was to compensate for the material Kerr
self-focusing, making n2,eﬀ < 0 by using cascaded eﬀects,
and this would give a pulse compressor without ﬁlamen-
tation limitations; it was ﬁrst investigated in25, where an
SPM-induced self-defocusing spectral broadening was in-
duced in a quadratic nonliner crystal (BBO, beta-barium
borate). The eﬀective self-defocusing nonlinearity gave a
negative chirp across the pulse, so the pulse could be
compressed by passing it through a piece of bulk glass
with positive normal dispersion.

A similar experiment was conducted by Ashihara et

2

al.26, but instead of compressing the pulse ”externally”,
they achieved soliton self-compression inside the crys-
tal. This is because at the pump wavelength (800 nm
from a TiSa ampliﬁer) BBO has normal group-velocity
dispersion (GVD), and for β2 > 0 exciting a soliton re-
quires n2,eﬀ < 0. Although the soliton excitation was con-
ﬁrmed, the compression ratio was moderate. This is be-
cause BBO has a large group-velocity mismatch (GVM)
between pump and SH at this wavelength, and indeed
later experiments at longer wavelengths have shown few-
cycle soliton self-compression in BBO due to a reduced
GVM27,28.

Once the soliton has formed, it may become phase-
matched to generate resonant radiation (i.e. a dispersive
wave)29. Since the self-defocusing soliton needs normal
dispersion to form, the dispersive wave will naturally be
generated in the anomalous dispersion regime, i.e. to the
long-wavelength side30,31. This was recently experimen-
tally veriﬁed in bulk BBO and LN28,32, and together with
the soliton the dispersive wave(s) constitute the octave-
spanning supercontinuum in the self-defocusing soliton
case, which for LN can extend from 1.0-4.0 µm.

This type of dispersive wave is quite similar to the
one observed in Kerr media, since it is mediated by four-
wave mixing (FWM, degenerate28,32 or non-degenerate
case28,33), but with the cascaded quadratic nonlinearity
we also found that there is a unique three-wave mix-
ing (TWM) analogue. This was recently observed exper-
imentally for the ﬁrst time34, where we found that in
BBO the SH beam had a parametrically tunable peak,
i.e. tunable by ﬁxing the pumping conditions and chang-
ing only a single parameter (the phase-mismatch param-
eter). It was tunable across the entire visible range and
was excited due to a dispersive wave phase-matching
condition to the pump near-IR soliton, but unlike the
Kerr case it relies on direct TWM, which is exactly why
it is parametrically tunable. Its phase-matching condi-
tion is related to the so-called nonlocal eﬀect observed
in cascaded nonlinearities35,36, which is a consequence
of soliton-dispersive wave intra-dispersion eﬀects (phase-
mismatch and GVM). Such a tunable dispersive wave is
also not common in Kerr media (only in gas-ﬁlled ﬁbers
has this been demonstrated37).

In BBO, the SHG phase-matching scheme is ”criti-
cal” or birefringence phase-matching, i.e. so-called type
I where the phase-matching is angle-dependent, and as a
consequence the pump and SH have orthogonal polariza-
tion (in BBO the oo → e scheme is used). Other soliton
self-compression experiments used such a pumping con-
ﬁguration in BBO or LN38–40; the main advantage is that
one can ﬁnd the SHG phase-matching condition, and the
slowly tune away from it by rotating the crystal to go
to the cascading limit; this gives huge cascaded nonlin-
earities because as soon as cascading sets in, it scales as
1/∆k and the maximum is found around ∆kL = π. The
angle tuning onset of cascading is also a very accurate
way of determining the n2,Kerr value41,42, as it is often
possible to ﬁnd the tuning angle where n2,eﬀ = 0. The

disadvantages of type I interaction are that deﬀ values
are moderate and that the pump and SH experience spa-
tial walk oﬀ. Thus, the crystal length is limited by this
constraint (or, equivalently, large enough pump spot sizes
must be used to minimize spatial walk-oﬀ eﬀects).

An entirely diﬀerent approach is to use ”non-critical”
interaction, i.e. so-called type 0 where pump and SH
have the same polarization and the phase-matching con-
ditions do not depend very much on angle (hence the
name non-critical). The advantages are that one may ex-
ploit the large diagonal tensor components, e.g. the d33
of LN, and that spatial walk-oﬀ is nil. For supercontin-
uum generation the added bonus is that the SH has the
same polarization as the pump, so there can be a con-
siderable harmonic extension of the continuum (multi-
ple octaves have been observed in LN waveguides18,19).
The disadvantages are that the intra-harmonic dispersion
(i.e. between pump and SH) is very large (so ∆k and
GVM are very big), and that phase-matching is impossi-
ble (impossible to get ∆k = 0 and locate the SHG phase
matching point as well as the maximum cascading point
∆kL = π). Despite the large ∆k, the cascading nonlinear
index n2,casc = −d2
eﬀ/∆k can be quite signiﬁcant: this is
because deﬀ is often very large and is thereby able to com-
pensate for the large ∆k. Importantly, for type 0 interac-
tion ∆k > 0 if pumped not too close to an UV absorption
region, because the SH will always have a larger refractive
index than the pump (remember ∆k ∝ [n(ω2) − n(ω1)]).
This means that in type 0 the cascaded SHG nonlinear-
ity in a bulk crystal will always be self-defocusing. The
question is merely: is it strong enough to overcome the
material Kerr nonlinearity and generate an eﬀective self-
defocusing eﬀect? We can pose this limit as a ﬁgure-of-
merit parameter FOM = |n2,casc|/n2,Kerr and if FOM > 1
then the self-defocusing nonlinearity is dominating. LN
has an FOM > 1 in the near-IR, as we used this to ex-
cite a temporal few-cycle soliton21 when pumping in the
normal GVD regime below its ZDW of 1.92 µm, followed
by octave-spanning supercontinuum generation32.

A similar approach to what we attempt here was con-
ducted recently by Ashihara et al.5, where GaAs was
pumped in the mid-IR just below its ZDW to give sig-
niﬁcant spectral broadening (well over 2000 nm of band-
width) at 5.0 µm. GaAs has a very large quadratic non-
linearity, and is as such a good cascading candidate, but
we calculate its FOM to be less than unity, i.e. self-
focusing is dominating, and this was also noted by the
authors. Therefore the spectral broadening came purely
from self-focusing SPM due to the high material n2,Kerr
of GaAs. Finally, we mention that in quadratic nonlin-
ear crystals it is also possible to perform adiabatic near-
IR to mid-IR frequency conversion and achieve octave-
spanning bandwidths43.

III. LITHIUM THIOINDATE

Using LN as an inspiration, we recently calculated the
FOM for a range of mid-IR crystals22, who all have very
large diagonal tensor components and possibility of get-
ting crystal cut for non-critical SHG. One of the main
crystals that attracted our interest was LIS, because it
has a ZDW around 3.53 µm and an FOM ≃ 2. Further-
more it is commercially available in quite big samples.
Our simulations showed soliton formation and resonant
radiation in the mid-IR, eventually giving supercontin-
uum radiation over several octaves in the mid-IR.

For the present experiment we used a commercially
available LIS crystal (Moltech), 15 mm long and 6 ×
6 mm2 aperture. LIS belongs to the biaxial mm2 point
group and our sample was cut with θ = 90◦ and φ = 0.
This gives a maximum quadratic nonlinearity deﬀ = d33
where d33 = 16 pm/V@2.3 µm44. This cut makes the
SHG noncritical so both pump and SH have the same
polarization (both are ”slow” waves, with linear refrac-
tive index given by nZ, see more details in22). The SHG
process is highly phase-mismatched (coherence length
lcoh = π/∆k ≃ 60 µm), but notably not as much as in
LN (where the coherence length can be an order of mag-
nitude shorter). Due to the high quadratic nonlinearity
the cascading Kerr nonlinear index is large (n2,casc =
−2ω1d2
eﬀ /[ε0c2n2(ω1)n(ω2)∆k] ≃ −60 · 10−20 m2/W in
the pump range of interest). The competes with the ma-
terial Kerr nonlinearity, and for LIS the cubic nonlin-
ear tensor components are not known. However, from its

and (d) 3.86 µm, and for various pump intensities (indicated in GW/cm2). The power spectral density (PSD) normalized to

ν = 1/λ, as often used in spectroscopy. Note the absorption dip at the CO2 line (ν ≃ 2, 600 cm−1).

rather high bandgap along the Z direction (Eg = 3.55
eV44) the two-band model (see22 for details) estimates
the Kerr nonlinearity to be around +30·10−20 m2/W. We
therefore expect the overall cubic nonlinearity to be self-
defocusing. This is summarized in Fig. 1, which shows
the wavelength dependence of the material and cascaded
Kerr nonlinear indices, calculated as discussed in22. In
the range 2-7 µm the eﬀective nonlinearity is predicted
to be self-defocusing, and the deducted FOM (i.e. the
ratio between the cascaded and Kerr nonlinearity) is as
high as 2, very similar to LN.

IV. RESULTS

We pumped the LIS crystal with 85 fs 50 µJ pulses
in the 3.0-3.9 µm range from a commercial 1 kHz TiSa-
ampliﬁer based optical parametric ampliﬁer (OPA) fol-
lowed by a non-collinear diﬀerence-frequency generation
stage. The pulses had around 200-250 nm bandwidth and
were close to transform limit. The input beam was loosely
focused (0.27 mm FWHM). The intensity controlled by
adjusting the pump power level of the OPA. The output
was measured with an FPAS-1600 spectrometer with a
cooled MCT detector from Infrared Systems, and long-
pass ﬁlters were used to selectively cover the 1-7 µm
range.

The results for diﬀerent pump intensities and pump

wavelengths are summarized in Fig. 2. Generally, we
needed around 150 GW/cm2 to see an octave-spanning
supercontinuum. The bandwidths in the maximum peak
power cases exceed 2 octaves (1.6-7.0 µm@ − 20 dB for
λ = 3.86 µm pump). For the two cases that used pump-
ing close to the ZDW, the supercontinuum is very ﬂat
across the central range, while in the two cases pumping
further away the supercontinuum is more modulated.

The broadest supercontinuum was observed when
pumping above the ZDW. This is surprising as we would
have expected the broadest supercontinuum in the soli-
ton case, i.e. when pumping below the ZDW. The soliton
itself is very broadband (typically close to single cycle)
and is furthermore also able to excite the resonant radia-
tion in the anomalous dispersion regime above the ZDW,
which further extends the bandwidth. We believe the ex-
planation lies in the proximity of the pump wavelength to
the ZDW, which means that even when pumping above
the ZDW the early-stage spectral broadening leaks into
the normal dispersion regime. When the most intense
pulses were applied this allows a soliton to form despite
pumping in the non-solitonic regime (and as such it is
kind of the reverse case recently found in28,30).

Numerical simulations were used to understand the
experimental data. These were plane-wave simula-
tions using the so-called Nonlinear Analytical Envelope
Equation45,46, which is an envelope-like approach that
is actually modeling the carrier wave, and has therefore

sub-carrier wave resolution and includes a complete ex-
pansion of the nonlinear terms. The NAEE was recently
extended to include both quadratic, cubic and delayed
Raman eﬀects47. The Raman mode was taken the same
as in22, and the best agreements with the experimental
results were seen using n2,Kerr = 50 · 10−20 m2/W and a
Raman fraction fR = 0.2; this implies that the electronic
Kerr nonlinearity is 40 · 10−20 m2/W, quite close to the
value predicted by the two-band model in Fig. 1. Finally,
for the selected cut, LIS has no SHG coupling to the or-
thogonal polarization (for the ss → f channel deﬀ = 0).
As the cubic tensor components are taken isotropic, they
do not have any cross-polarization coupling either, so we
only need to model the input s polarization.

An speciﬁc simulation example is shown in Fig. 3,
where we chose λ = 3.05 µm and a moderate intensity,
corresponding to the green curve in Fig. 2(a). The time
domain in (a) and (b) show that a self-compressed soli-
ton forms after 11 mm, but it is accompanied with two
minor satellite pulses. Such pulse splitting may be caused
by competing nonlinearities to the SPM from a combi-
nation of the Raman eﬀect and self-steepening21,41,48.
Especially the self-steepening can become strong in cas-
cading since it contributes to the intrinsic Kerr-induced

self-steepening with a scaling factor d12/∆k, i.e. the ratio
between GVM and phase mismatch35,41,49. In the spec-
tral domain, signiﬁcant spectral broadening occurs up to
the self-compression point, and after this stage a broad-
band dispersive wave forms in the range 4.0-5.0 µm. This
peak can also be noticed in the experimental spectrum
in Fig. 2(a). Towards shorter wavelengths the second-
and third-harmonic spectra are evident, although the
latter is quite weak. Notice that the harmonic spectra
also show continuum generation; this is because they
are not phase-matched, and in the cascading limit the
harmonic spectrum is ”slaved” or ”locked” to the pump
spectrum35,50,51.

Figure 4 compares simulations for the λ1 = 3.39 µm
case qualitatively with the experimental data for diﬀerent
intensities. The simulations show a good agreement con-
cerning the spectral bandwidth, especially in the mid-IR.
In the near-IR the simulations have a clear peak at the SH
wavelength (although it becomes somewhat blue-shifted
at high intensities, an eﬀect that is already apparent in
Fig. 3(e) despite the moderate intensity used there), and
the experimental data do not show this. This could be
because the plane-wave simulations only model the on-
axis distribution, while in the experiment the aperture of
the mid-IR monochromator was quite big so it essentially
records a spatial average over most of the beam. Another
explanation, at least for high intensities, is instead that
diﬀraction can no longer be neglected, as we show be-
low. Thus, the assumptions behind the plane-wave model
breaks down and a full 3+1D simulation must be carried
out.

We also attempted, along the lines of the results shown
in21,26–28, to measure a self-compressed soliton with a
home-built intensity autocorrelator. However, we were
not able to ﬁnd clear signs of a clean compressed soliton,
and to understand this, the detailed numerical simula-

tions in Fig. 3 show multiple pulse splitting. This means
that a single compressed pulse is rarely seen and instead
two or more short pulses form, which are much harder to
detect with an autocorrelation unit.

The numerical simulations included noise to gauge the
coherence of the spectra. The chosen noise source corre-
sponds to the quantum ﬂuctuations in the vacuum state
according to the Wigner representation52–54. The advan-
tage of the Wigner representation (compared to P or Q)
is that the noise is additive and is only added in the
initial condition; this means that the standard split-step
routine based on Runge-Kutta ODE solvers can be use.
Conversely more rigorous Langevin solvers like the Heun
method are needed for the multiplicative noise of the P
and Q representation, i.e. where noise must be added
at every z step. In order to model the vacuum state in
the Wigner representation, a half photon per temporal
mode is added to the initial condition with Gaussian
white noise distribution54. This approach is diﬀerent than
the usual one-photon-per-mode approach55, which adds
a Gaussian distributed phase noise in frequency domain
with 1 photon per frequency mode average energy den-
sity. In time domain this approach has on average 2π half
photons per mode; this does not conform with the vac-
uum ﬂuctuations of the Wigner model. With this noise
implementation, we repeated each simulation case a suit-
able number of times with diﬀerent initial noise realiza-
tions to be able to calculate the ﬁrst order spectral co-
herence function g(1)
12 , and we found that the coherence of
the spectra to be excellent: an example is shown in Fig.
3(c) where the spetral coherence function is unity across
the generated supercontinuum. We even attempted to
add an additional signiﬁcantly stronger noise source than
the vacuum ﬂuctuations (i.e. noise from the ampliﬁcation
stage or technical noise sources, all modeled in the same
way as a Gaussian white noise but with many photons per
temporal mode), and the high coherence still pertained.
In the experiment we also characterized the transverse
cross section of the output beam with an uncooled mi-
crobolometer camera. The camera is sensitive in the en-
tire range of the recorded supercontinua. The measure-
ments were done around 20 cm from the exit of the crys-
tal, and from the beam waist size of the input beam
(w0 = 0.2 mm) we estimate that the distance z/zR ≃ 5,
i.e. 5 times the Rayleigh length. This places the cam-
era in the Fresnel diﬀraction zone. The evolution of the
beam vs. intensity showed formation of a more narrow
spot in the center. Although this was not a near-ﬁeld
measurement, it does indicate diﬀraction for high inten-
sities. This could be related to the pulse compression but
it might also indicate that the self-defocusing cascading
and self-focusing material Kerr eﬀects are competing and
give nontrivial spatio-temporal coupling. Further experi-
ments are needed to clarify this.

That being said, the spectra and the spatial character-
ization did not reveal any ﬂuctuations in the transverse
beam proﬁle on a shot-to-shot level and the long-term
stability was good. Thus, despite the diﬀraction that

6

we observed, the generated supercontinua are stable and
should be quite useful for spectroscopy. As a case in point,
we veriﬁed that the supercontinuum could be used to do
simple absorption measurements: by passing the super-
continuum through an LN crystal, we could reconstruct
transmission curves quite similar to FTIR measurements
of the crystal (in particular the 4-6 µm mid-IR absorption
edge matched very well).

V. CONCLUSION

We have experimentally demonstrated multiple-octave
spanning supercontinuum generation by pumping a bulk
lithium thioindate (LIS) crystal in the 3.0-3.9 µm range
with bright 50 µJ 85 fs pulses. The crystal was pumped
with a loosely focused 0.27 mm diameter beam and
the onset of a supercontinuum (octave spanning) was
typically around 150 GW/cm2,
i.e. around 10 µJ of
pulse energy. The crystal was cut for noncritical phase-
mismatched SHG, giving a strong self-defocusing non-
linearity. We did see diﬀraction eﬀects in the transverse
part of the beam at high intensities, and we will in future
experiments look into the cause of this. This notwith-
standing, the supercontinua at high intensities did re-
veal any signiﬁcant spatial ﬂuctuations and should there-
fore be quite useful for spectroscopy. The broadest spec-
trum spanned the range from 1.6-7.0 µm, enough to
cover the entire range of fundamental vibrational fre-
quencies of hydrogen and carbon-type bonds, including
the near-IR part needed to cover their ﬁrst overtones.
Especially because the overtones can be probed as well,
this makes it extremely desirable for mid-IR vibrational
spectroscopy. This technique can readily be used in other
mid-IR quadratic nonlinear crystals as well, which means
that other parts of the mid-IR can be covered, especially
the ﬁngerprint region from 6-12 µm, by pumping similar
crystals at longer wavelengths.
