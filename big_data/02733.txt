Abstract.

Thin layers of black phosphorus present an ideal combination of a 2D material
with a tunable direct bandgap and high carrier mobility. However the material
suﬀers from degradation in ambient conditions due to an oxidation reaction which
involves water, oxygen and light. We have measured the spatial proﬁle of the
conductivity on ﬂakes of black phosphorus as a function of time using scanning
microwave impedance microscopy. A microwave excitation (3 GHz) allows to
image a conducting sample even when covered with a dielectric layer. We observe
that on bare black phosphorus, the conductivity changes drastically over the
whole surface within a day. We demonstrate that the degradation process is
slowed down considerably by covering the material with a 10 nm layer of hafnium
oxide. It is stable for more than a week, opening up a route towards stable black
phosphorus devices in which the high dielectric constant of hafnium oxide can be
exploited. Covering black phosphorus with a 15 nm boron nitride ﬂake changes
the degradation process qualitatively, it is dominated by the edges of the ﬂake
indicating a diﬀusive process and happens on the scale of days.

Spatial conductivity mapping of unprotected and capped black phosphorus using microwave microscopy2

Black phosphorus is a solid, Van der Waals bonded form of elemental phosphorus
which can be synthesised under high pressure. A hundred years after the discovery of
the bulk form and subsequent investigation of the bulk properties, black phosphorus
(black P) was very recently rediscovered as a two-dimensional layered material [1].
Unlike the other elemental 2D material graphene, black P has a direct bandgap,
which is tuneable with layer thickness from around 2 eV for a monolayer to 0.3 eV
for bulk [2, 3]. Combined with a high mobility, it is a very promising material for
optoelectronic applications. Several reviews appeared this year that summarise and
provide references to the rapidly growing body of literature on the chemistry, physics
and applications of black P [4, 5, 6, 7].

For any application in ambient conditions the environmental stability of a material
is crucial. However black P has been shown to degrade very rapidly without protective
measures. Various studies have been carried out on water absorption at the hydrophilic
surface of black P and the consequences for devices [8, 9, 10]. Chemical analysis
shows that degradation occurs due to photooxidation, a process which simultaneously
requires oxygen, water and energy (light) [11, 12] and ends with a transformation to
phosphoric acid. The reaction rate depends exponentially on the square of the energy
gap and therefore depends strongly on the number of layers, and could be initiated on
material defects [13].

Attempts to protect black P from environmental degradation in ambient
conditions involve capping layers of deposited AlOx [14, 15, 16, 17, 18], other 2D
materials such as boron nitride (BN) [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], polymer layers [25]
or combinations of these [7, 26]. Where there are many techniques to monitor the
degradation process for a bare black P ﬂake (e.g. optical microscopy, atomic force
microscopy (AFM), Raman scattering, chemical analysis), the techniques to monitor
the eﬀectiveness of a capping layer are scarce. Most of the cited studies monitor the
degradation under a capping layer by the performance (conductivity) of a transistor
channel, which reduces the information to a single number as a function of time. This
is useful to characterise device stability, but does hide the spatial conductivity proﬁle
of the ﬂake while (possibly) degrading.

Here we report scanning Microwave Impedance Microscopy (sMIM) measure-
ments on bare black P, black P protected with ALD-deposited HfO2 and black P
protected with BN. sMIM is an AFM-based microscope technique, which measures the
local conductivity of a sample by monitoring the microwave reﬂection from a metallic
tip with a typical resolution of ∼50 nm [26, 27, 28]. Because the high frequency signal
(3 GHz) penetrates through dielectric layers, the conductivity of a buried layer below
a dielectric can be imaged without the need for contacts. We show that on a bare
black P ﬂake, the conductivity changes drastically over the whole surface over the
course of hours, consistent with the previously discussed literature. We demonstrate
that the degradation process is slowed down considerably by covering the material
with a 10 nm layer of hafnium oxide, under which black P remains stable for at least
11 days. This opens up a route towards stable black P devices with HfO2, in which
the high dielectric constant of HfO2 can be used (e.g. as a gate dielectric). A recent
studies also suggests that the mobility in BP is enhanced due to a HfO2 capping layer
[29]. Covering black phosphorus with a 15 nm boron nitride ﬂake does not completely
stabilise black P and changes the phenomenology of the degradation process compared
to the bare ﬂake. It is much slower (days) and is dominated by the edges of the black
P ﬂake. This indicates that the surface is protected, but a diﬀusive process still de-
grades the black P starting from the edges despite the full coverage with a large BN

ﬂake. Although quite a few studies on capping black P with boron nitride have been
reported, we present the ﬁrst conductivity images of the buried black P under BN
as a function of time. Signatures of such an edge process were also found in black P
covered with thin AlOx [26] and in solution processed black P [30].

Preparation of few-layer black P ﬂakes is carried out using a modiﬁed mechanical
exfoliation technique as discussed in detail in [31]. Bulk, commercially available black
P (99.998%, Smart Elements) is used in this study. By employing a viscoelastic stamp
(poly- dimethilsiloxane (PDMS)) as an intermediate substrate for exfoliation, thin
black P ﬂakes are transferred to a SiO2 substrate leaving less residue compared with
using Scotch tape only. Thin ﬂakes are then identiﬁed by contrast under an optical
microscope. We have measured samples using three diﬀerent ways of preparation
as described below. We monitored each sample with sMIM over time. The ﬁrst
sample contains bare black P ﬂakes. For the second sample, after preparing the
black P ﬂakes on SiO2, the whole sample is covered with a layer of 10 nm of HfO2
using atomic layer deposition. For the third sample, immediately after identifying a
thin ﬂake of black P, this ﬂake was covered with a large, thin ﬂake (about 25 µm
x 25 µm x 15 nm) of boron nitride, which completely covers the black P ﬂake (4x6
µm). The boron-nitride ﬂake is prepared in the same way as the black P ﬂake onto
the viscoelastic stamp and positioned on top of the selected black P ﬂake under an
optical microscope to make sure the latter is fully covered. Detailed characterisation
using optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, transport measurements, Raman
spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy of the same black P using the same
exfoliation technique was reported before in References [9] and [10].

To measure the time dependence of the local sheet resistance of the black P
ﬂakes we employed sMIM. This technique is based on a microwave signal (3 GHz)
which is launched to a shielded, nanofabricated cantilever (Primenano) using a coaxial
cable. The reﬂected signal contains information about the local tip-sample impedance.
The typical spatial resolution is given by the tip radius, nominally 50 nm. The
microwave system (ScanWave, Primenano) is mounted on a regular AFM (Cypher,
Asylum Research). sMIM therefore provides topographical information of the sample,
combined with a map of local conductivity variations. It is ideal to study the local
temporal conductivity variations of black P since it does not require contacts, it allows
for ﬂakes with thickness variations, and it can image through dielectric layers such
as the BN (in contrast to DC-transport based techniques). A sketch of the sMIM
technique is shown in Figure 1a.

To relate the microwave response to the local sheet resistance of the sample,
we have performed ﬁnite element simulations using HFSS. Above the tip apex, the
metallic part extends in pyramidal form to 5 µm above the sample, where it ends in
the central strip of the (shielded) microwave stripline on the cantilever. Therefore
in the simulation the whole tip (pyramid + apex) has to be taken into account. We
deﬁne a port at the point where the transmission line starts and calculate the complex
reﬂection coeﬃcient as a function of the sheet resistance of the sample underneath the
tip. The tip-sample distance is taken to be 0.2 nm. The simulated sample is a 5x5
µm disk on an insulating substrate with a dielectric constant of 3.9 (SiO2). The
resulting electric ﬁeld distribution is shown in the colour plot in Figure 1b. The
real and imaginary part of the microwave response are shown in Figure 1c. The
real part corresponds to resistance (losses) and the imaginary part to the reactance
(capacitance), which both change if the sheet resistance is varied. We have simulated
all three cases (bare, with BN, with HfO2) in HFSS and found the same response

curves. We use the maximum contrast between the real and imaginary response at
low sheet resistance to frequently calibrate the response, using a sample with metal
structures on an insulating substrate. We then calibrate the measured data to account
for long term changes of the tip (due to e.g. wear) in between the measurements in
which we are monitoring the time dependence of the sheet resistance of the sample.
The maximum signal on the calibration sample is -15 mV for the data in Figures 1
and 4, -20 mV for the data in Figure 2 and +8 mV for the data in Figure 3. The
imaginary part of the response can be either positive or negative on the calibration
sample. The sign depends on a phase-shift of the signal which varies from tip to tip,
which can easily be determined from the calibration measurement.

To demonstrate the power of the technique, we ﬁrst present results on the BN
capped sample.
In this experiment we operated the AFM/sMIM in contact mode.
This does not aﬀect the degradation process because the BP ﬂake is protected by the
BN layer and at the same time gives slightly better signal to noise for the microwave
signal. An optical microscope picture and an AFM height map are shown in Figures
1d,f. We identify three regions with diﬀerent thickness, 46 nm, 9 nm and 5 nm. A
height proﬁle crossing the ﬁrst two regions is shown in Figure 1e. Note that the height
steps are less sharp than for a bare black P sample (in Figure 2) due to the BN
ﬂake on top. Figures 1f,i show the height maps 1 hour and 30 hours after fabrication

respectively, showing no noticeable change. Panels g and j compare the imaginary
part of the microwave response and panels h and k the real part. Especially in the
imaginary part, a drastic change is seen over time, which is the largest at the edges of
the covered black P ﬂake. The change is consistent with an increase in the conductivity
as reported from transport studies. sMIM provides the additional information of how
the degradation process evolves over space and time as it allows to image through the
dielectric cap with high spatial resolution. Before we present the detailed time series
of the BN-capped sample, we ﬁrst discuss results on a bare black P ﬂake and on a
black P ﬂake covered with HfO2.

Figure 2a shows an optical microscope image of a bare black P ﬂake, from
which we identify four regions with diﬀerent thickness.
In this experiment we use
the AFM/sMIM in tapping mode, not to disturb the formation of water droplets on
the BP [10]. Figure 2d shows the height map of the ﬂake, a cross section of which is
shown in Figure 2b. The indicated regions A, B, C and D have thicknesses of 8 nm, 13
nm, 20 nm, and 55 nm respectively. Figure 2c shows the simulated microwave sMIM
response as a function of the sheet resistance of the studied ﬂake. Figures 2e,f show
the imaginary and real part of the microwave response right after the fabrication of
the sample (within 2 hours). We observe a clear diﬀerence in response for the diﬀerent
thicknesses. Using both response pictures we can get an order of magnitude estimate

of the sheet resistance of the regions, which is indicated in the response curve in Fig.
2c. The thinner regions have a higher sheet resistance, as expected. Thinner BP
has a higher bandgap [9], which due to the lower number of thermally excited charge
carriers leads to a lower conductivity and higher sheet resistance. On top of that a
thinner layer gives a higher sheet resistance for the same conductivity. Note that the
real part of the response is non-monotonic and would make it diﬃcult to derive sheet
resistance, Rs, from the microwave response, especially for regions B and C. Also the
height diﬀerence by itself changes the contrast in the imaginary signal slightly (small
change in capitance). Since the real part sometimes shows the largest change over
time, we show here the microwave signal, not converted to sheet resistance, noting
that this could in principle be done using Figure 2c.

Figures 2g-i show the height proﬁle and microwave signal after 24 hours. We
observe that for regions B and C the sheet resistance drops drastically over the course
of one day, consistent with earlier transport measurements [10] on similar ﬂakes. The
response of regions A and D hardly changes because their Rs is in a region where
the microwave response is not sensitive (Figure 2c). We also observe that the sheet
resistance changes uniformly over each region with the same height, indicative of a
surface eﬀect, where the whole surface is exposed to the photo-oxidation reaction of
the black P.

To study the eﬀectiveness of an ALD-deposited dielectric, we measured the
conductivity map of a sample with black P ﬂakes, covered with a 10 nm layer of
HfO2 fabricated as described above. In this experiment we used the tapping mode of
the AFM, because it appeared that in contact mode the tip easily picks up particles
from the deposited dielectric. Figure 3a shows an optical microscope picture of a
uniform, 12 nm thick, black P ﬂake covered by HfO2. Figure 3b shows the height map
of the ﬂake, with a cross section at the position indicated in red in panel c. Figure
3d shows the real (top row) and the imaginary part (bottom row) of the microwave
response, as a function of time after fabrication as indicated below the images. We

observe that the drastic changes in the sMIM response of the bare black P, starting
on the whole surface (Figure 2), and of the BN covered black P, starting from the
edges (Figure 4), do not occur. The signal on this sample is stable over the course
of 11 days. This indicates that the chemical and electrical properties of black P are
preserved under HfO2. Compared to the Al2O3 cover in [26] (a few days stability), this
deposited dielectric preserves black P much longer. After 11 days, the signal became
fainter for this ﬂake, which we could not directly relate to either the sample or the
tip, but it does not show the same pronounced degradation signatures as in the bare
black P or the BN-covered case. We obtain similar results on two other ﬂakes on the
same substrate. On a higher ﬂake (30 nm), we observed bubbles on the ﬂake after
42 days, indicating that the HfO2 slows down the degradation process, but does not
completely preserve black P in the long run.

Where the results on bare black P and a deposited HfO2 cover are consistent with
previous works, the spatial proﬁle of the conductivity under a BN ﬂake capping as a
function of time has not yet been reported. In presenting the sMIM technique around
Figure 1, we already introduced the measurement with the BN cover. Figure 4 shows
the time evolution of the microwave signal in the imaginary (top row) and real (bottom
row) parts. We observe that initially we have low contrast (signature of a relatively
high sheet resistance). However, after one day the sheet resistance drops as indicate
by the stronger signal in the imaginary response, where the eﬀect is the largest on
the edges. The eﬀect slowly diﬀuses inwards and only after a week we start to see the
same eﬀect on the thicker part of the sample. This process is markedly diﬀerent from
the bare black P data in Figure 2, where a clear surface eﬀect is observed. Clearly the
BN does not shield the black P suﬃciently well from the environment. It is unlikely
that water captured during fabrication causes this process, since that would rather
give a homogeneous eﬀect over the whole surface. Moreover from the bare black P
results, captured water during fabrication is expected to react much quicker with black
P than we observe in this experiment. A degradation process dominated by the edges
was also observed in [26] for a (too) thin layer of ALD deposited Al2O3. In [26] it
was argued that the sidewalls of a relatively high ﬂake are not covered by a thin ALD
deposited layer, eﬀectively creating gaps in the protecting layer at the ﬂakes edges.
However the large BN ﬂake that we use is a continuous cover of the black P ﬂake and
its edges, which makes such edge leakage unlikely.

We emphasise that the height of the BN covered black P does not change over
the measurement time, in contrast to bare BP ﬂakes, where a layer of water is visible
on top of the ﬂake [10]. By monitoring the electronic properties of the material with
sMIM, the ageing process can still be identiﬁed.

In summary, we have measured the spatial proﬁle of the conductivity on ﬂakes of
black P with varying thickness as a function of time using sMIM. On a bare ﬂake, the
conductivity changes drastically over the whole surface over the course of hours due to
the reaction of black P with water and oxygen. We demonstrate that the degradation
process is slowed down to a timescale of weeks when the black P is covered with a 10
nm layer of ALD deposited HfO2. This does not only extend the variety of materials
with which BP can be protected, but also opens up a route towards stable black P
devices in which the high dielectric constant of HfO2 can be exploited. The deposition
of HfO2 could also be preceded by surface oxidation step of the black P, which creates
a native oxide layer which potentially also protects against environmental degradation
[32, 33].

Covering black phosphorus with a 15 nm boron nitride ﬂake changes the

degradation process qualitatively, it is much slower than on a bare ﬂake (days) and
is dominated by the edges of the ﬂake indicating a diﬀusive process, despite the full
coverage of the black P with the BN sheet. This measurement demonstrates the unique
capability of sMIM by spatially mapping the conductivity of a buried layer.
