Abstract

We generalize the Fenchel theorem to strong spacelike (which means that the tangent
vector and the curvature vector span a spacelike 2-plane at each point) closed curves with
index 1 in the 3-dimensional Lorentz space, showing that the total curvatures must be less
than or equal to 2π. A similar generalization of the Fary-Milnor theorem is also obtained.
We establish the Crofton formula on the de Sitter 2-sphere which implies the above results.

vature, Crofton formula

1 Introduction

The total curvature of closed space curves (and submanifolds) is a classical topic in global
diﬀerential geometry and topology. The Fenchel theorem [1] says that in R3 there is always

R kds ≥ 2π, and equality is attained exactly for convex plane curves. The Fary-Milnor

theorem [2] says that for nontrivial knot the lower bound is 4π. (See also the appendix of
[3] for an enlightening discussion.)

The main purpose of this paper is to generalize these beautiful results to the 3-dimensional
Lorentz space R3
1. For that task, it is crucial to ﬁnd the appropriate assumptions and correct
upper/lower bounds beforehand. We clarify these issues by making several observations as
below.

(1) The strong spacelike condition. First, we would like the curve to have a moving
frame at every point of the same type, so that not only there exist closed examples, but also
one can deﬁne the length and the total curvature in a consistent way. A basic fact is that
in R3
1, there exist neither closed timelike curve, nor closed spacelike curves with timelike
normals (see Section 2 for deﬁnitions of these terms and Remark 3.2). So it is natural to
consider only the curves whose tangent vector T and curvature vector κN span a spacelike
2-plane at each point. We call this class as strong spacelike curves, because they are not
only spacelike curves, but also with spacelike osculating planes. In particular, we do not
allow inﬂection points where the curvature vanishes. (So we can assume that the curvature
satisﬁes κ > 0.)

(2) The index I: a well-deﬁned global invariant. Diﬀerent from the Euclidean
3-space, there is a well-deﬁned notion of index for closed spacelike curves in the Lorentz 3-
space. This is the winding number of the tangent indicatrix (the image of the unit tangent
vector T ) around the de Sitter sphere S2
1 : hX, Xi = 1} (the usual one-sheet
hyperboloid, which is homotopy equivalent to a circle).
It is integer-valued and always
assumed to be positive.
In the special case that I = 1, the closed curve winds around
some timelike axis exactly for one cycle; intuitively its shape is just a mild perturbation of
a convex plane curve, whose projection to any spacelike plane is still convex (see Remark 2.3).

1 = {X ∈ R3

(3) The reversed inequality. When we estimates the total curvature in this Lorentz
setup and compare with plane curves, one should expect a reversed inequality in contrast
with the Euclidean case. One reason is that the total curvature is equal to the length of
the tangent indicatrix T (S1). A normal variation of T (S1) in S2
1 is always along a timelike
direction, which decreases L(T (S1)) for a spacelike geodesic. (A line of altitude generally
has length greater than 2π. But it is located on one side of the equator and is contained in
a half space; hence it can not integrate to be a closed curve in R3

1.)

Now we can state the ﬁrst of our main theorems as below.

Some people (as we did before) might naively expect that a closed strong spacelike curve
in R3
1 with index I ≥ 2 will have an upper bound 2Iπ for its total curvature. Yet this is
not true: the total curvature in the general case for I ≥ 2 can be arbitrarily large (like the
example of a clam-shell curve in Section 4).
1 becomes more complicated, not only with higher index
I > 1, but also being a nontrivial knot? When I = 2 we have the following interesting

Rγ kds < 4π.

One of the main technical diﬃculties in proving these theorems is the loss of compactness.
For example, a powerful tool in proving both Fenchel theorem and Fary-Milnor theorem in
R3 is the Crofton formula in the integral geometry, which gives an estimation of the length
of an arc Γ on S2:

n(Y ⊥)dA = 4L(Γ).

ZS 2

Here Y ⊥ is the oriented great circle in S2 with Y as its pole, n(Y ⊥) is the number of
intersections of Y ⊥ with Γ, and L(Γ) is the length of Γ. The key point is that S2, the
image space of the tangent indicatrix and the moduli space of the oriented great circles, is
compact, endowed with the SO(3)-invariant metric. In contrast, for a strong spacelike curve
in the Lorentz 3-space, the tangent indicatrix T (γ) is in the non-compact de Sitter sphere
S2
1 is the hyperbolic plan H2 which is
1; the moduli space of the oriented great circles in S2
also non-compact. So it seems no hope to establish a similar theory of integral geometry at
the ﬁrst glance.

Fortunately, when the pole Y is very close to the lightcone (equivalently, when Y tends
to ∂H2, the boundary at inﬁnity of the hyperbolic plane), the intersection number n(Y ⊥) is
a constant 2I where I is the index of Γ ⊂ S2
1 (Lemma 2.7). Thus we can still establish the
Crofton formula in the de Sitter sphere as below (Theorem 2.6):

Here the integrand at the right hand side always has compact support. Theorem 1.1 and
1.2 follows easily from this.

piecewise smooth spacelike curves on S2
1. Applying this formula to the tangent indicatrix
T (γ) of a closed strong spacelike curve γ in the Lorentz 3-space, we will obtain the reversed
Fenchel inequality and the generalized Fary-Milnor theorem in Section 3. The discussions
of the upper/lower bound of total curvature and illustrating examples are left to Section 4.

2 The Crofton formula on the de Sitter sphere

At the beginning we brieﬂy review some standard deﬁnitions and ﬁx the notations in a
Lorentz space. Let R3
1 be the 3-dimensional real linear space endowed with the Lorentz
metric h·,·i. In a ﬁxed coordinate system, we may write

hX, Y i = x1y1 + x2y2 − x3y3, X = (x1, x2, x3), Y = (y1, y2, y3).

A vector X is called spacelike (lightlike, timelike) if hX, Xi > 0(= 0, < 0), respectively. A
subspace V is called spacelike (lightlike, timelike) if the Lorentz inner product restricts to
be a positive deﬁnite (degenerate, Lorentz) product on V . A curve or a surface in R3
1 is said
to be spacelike (lightlike, timelike) if its tangent space at each point is so.

There are two diﬀerent generalizations of the unit sphere in the Lorentz space: the de

Sitter sphere (the hyperboloid of one sheet)
S2
1 = {X ∈ R3

1|hX, Xi = 1},

and the hyperbolic plane (the upper half of the hyperboloid of two sheet)

the intersection of S2

Deﬁnition 2.1. The unit normal vector (timelike, future directed) of the spacelike plane is
called the pole of the corresponding closed geodesic, which take values in H2. If we denote
the pole by Y , the oriented closed spacelike geodesic will be denoted as Y ⊥. We will also
abuse the notation Y ⊥ to denote the 2-dimensional subspace orthogonal to Y if this will not
cause confusion.

Thus Y,−Y will correspond to the same closed geodesic with opposite orientations. This
establishes a 1-1 correspondence between the hyperbolic plane H2 and the space of oriented
closed spacelike geodesics on S2
1.

S2
1 has a standard parametrization in terms of latitude and longitude (ϕ, θ) as below:

(x1, x2, x3) = (cosh ϕ cos θ, cosh ϕ sin θ, sinh ϕ).

H2 has a similar expression (x1, x2, x3) = (sinh r cos θ, sinh r sin θ, cosh r). To overcome the
diﬃculty of the non-compactness, let us consider a hyperbolic closed geodesic disk with
radius R:

H2
R

, {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ H2|1 ≤ x3 ≤ cosh R}.

(3)

By restricting to a compact domain we can establish the following local version of the Crofton
formula. Notice that the hyperbolic geodesic disk H2
R, as well as the latitude and longitude
parameters, are all deﬁned under a ﬁxed coordinate system, which will be used throughout
the statement and the proof of the following theorem.

The Fenchel-type inequality

Here Y ⊥ is the closed geodesic with Y as its pole, n(Y ⊥) is the number of intersections of
Y ⊥ with Γ (counted with multiplicity, yet without sign), and L(Γ) is the length of Γ.

To prove this theorem, let us ﬁnd out the subset of the poles Y ∈ H2 so that Y ⊥ has
1|s ∈ [0, L]}

non-empty intersection with Γ. Without loss of generality, write Γ = {e1(s) ∈ S2
as a smooth curve with arc-length parameter s and length L = L(Γ), where

e1(s) = (cosh ϕ(s) cos θ(s), cosh ϕ(s) sin θ(s), sinh ϕ(s)).

Set

e2(s) = (− sin θ(s), cos θ(s), 0),
e3(s) = (sinh ϕ(s) cos θ(s), sinh ϕ(s) cos θ(s), cosh ϕ(s)).

de3
ds = ϕ′(s)e1 + sinh ϕ(s)θ′(s)e2.

(8)




Since Γ is spacelike and s is the arc-length parameter, we have:
cosh2 ϕ(s) · θ′(s)2 − ϕ′(s)2 = 1.

(9)
Remark 2.3. As a corollary to (9), there is always θ′(s) 6= 0. Without loss of generality,
suppose θ′(s) > 0 everywhere. This immediately implies that the projection of Γ to the
Ox1x2-plane is a plane curve whose tangent vector rotates in a monotonic way, hence a
convex plane curve in a general sense. In particular, for a closed strong spacelike curve of
index I = 1, its orthogonal projection to a spacelike plane is always a strictly convex Jordan
curve.

By (9), there exists a function τ (s) such that

cosh ϕ(s)θ′(s) = cosh τ (s), ϕ′(s) = sinh τ (s).

For a closed spacelike geodesic Y ⊥ intersecting Γ at e1(s), its pole can be written as

Y = sinh ψe2(s) + cosh ψe3(s).

(10)

(11)

Note that (s, ψ) gives a natural parametrization of the image of such poles. Restricted to
H2

R, by (7) there must be

Let’s diﬀerentiate Y to ﬁnd its geometric information:

Y ∈ H2

R ⇔ cosh ψ cosh ϕ(s) ≤ cosh R.

( ∂Y
∂ψ = cosh ψe2 + sinh ψe3,
∂Y
∂s = sinh(τ (s) − ψ)e1 + sinh ϕ(s)θ′(s) ∂Y
∂ψ .

The pull-back of the area element from the hyperbolic plane H2 by Y is

dY = sinh|τ (s) − ψ|dψds.

(12)

(13)

(14)

Remark 2.4. We can read out the information of the pull-back metric by Y from (13) and
(14). It degenerates when τ (s) = ψ. By (11), (10) and the ﬁrst formula in (8), we see that
this happens exactly when the closed geodesic Y ⊥ intersects with Γ non-transversely.

Proof to Theorem 2.2.

Rewrite the left hand side of (4) as an iterated integral:

We need to choose the radius R large enough by the following considerations:

The Fenchel-type inequality

1. To determine the lower and upper limit ψ1(s), ψ2(s) for any given s, note that the poles
{Y |Y ⊥ ∩ Γ = e1(s)} form a subset of H2, which we hope to has nonempty intersection
with H2

R. By (12) one needs only to choose R so large that

maxs∈[0,L] cosh ϕ(s) < cosh R.

Then for any s, the inequality (12) always has solutions ψ ∈ [ψ1(s), ψ2(s)] with

cosh ψi(s) =

cosh R

cosh ϕ(s)

.

(16)

(17)

2. To determine the sign of τ (s) − ψi, note that cosh ϕ(s) is bounded on s ∈ [0, L], hence
cosh ψi(s) increases with R according to (17), yet cosh τ (s) is uniformly bounded by
(10). Choose R so large that

maxs∈[0,L] cosh2 ϕ(s)θ′(s) < cosh R.

(18)

Then ψ1(s) < τ (s) < ψ2(s) for each s.

Now the ﬁrst integral in (15) can be evaluated as below:

Z ψ2(s)

ψ1(s)

sinh|τ (s) − ψ|dψ = Z τ (s)

ψ1(s)

sinh(τ (s) − ψ)dψ +Z ψ2(s)

τ (s)

sinh(ψ − τ (s))dψ

= cosh(τ (s) − ψ1(s)) + cosh(ψ2(s) − τ (s)) − 2
= cosh τ (s)(cosh ψ1(s) + cosh ψ2(s)) − 2
= 2 cosh R · θ′(s) − 2.

Here we used (17) and (10) in the last step. The conclusion follows easily.

The results above are not quite satisfying for us, because they are only meaningful with
respect to a ﬁxed coordinate system, and some artiﬁcial constant R is involved. So we
proceed to derive a geometrically invariant version.

Combining (22) and (19) we obtain the ﬁrst conclusion. The second one follows if we
can show n(Y ⊥) − 2I is zero outside a compact domain. This is guaranteed by the next
lemma.

Y ⊥ is a 2-dimensional subspace orthogonal to Y . Then the intersection number n(Y ⊥) =
♯{Γ ∩ Y ⊥} must be 2I in the following two cases:

1. Y ⊥ is timelike or lightlike (i.e., Y is spacelike or lightlike);

2. Y ⊥ is spacelike and close enough to the lightcone (i.e., Y is timelike, and the corre-

sponding point on H2 is contained in a suitable neighborhood of ∂H2.)

Equivalently we consider the zeros of the continuous function

Lemma 2.7 is a natural fact from a geometric viewpoint. When the subspace Y ⊥ is
timelike or lightlike, a closed spacelike curve Γ must wind around the x3 axis in a monotonic
way and intersect Y ⊥ exactly two times in one cycle, hence with 2I intersection points
when the index is I. If we perturb Y to be a timelike vector and Y ⊥ to be spacelike, this
intersection number n(Y ⊥) = ♯{Γ∩ Y ⊥} should be the same constant 2I if the perturbation
is small enough, because Γ is compact and n(Y ⊥) is an integer depending on Y continuously.
This observation led us to the discovery of this Crofton formula.
Remark 2.8. We can provide another conceptual proof to Lemma 2.7. Consider the following
set-valued mapping ΦΓ from R3

1 \ {0} to subsets of Γ:

ΦΓ(Y ) , Γ ∩ Y ⊥ = {Γ(s)|he1(s), Y i = 0}.

Notice that the critical points of this mapping Φ is nothing but the locus of the co-normal
vectors of the closed curve Γ as given by
{Y |he1(s), Y i = 0 = he′

for some s ∈ [0, L]}.

1(s), Y i,

These timelike lines encloses a cone Ω inside the lightcone. Its complement in R3
1 \ {0} is a
connected domain Ω∗ which also includes all the spacelike and (nonzero) lightlike vectors.
ΦΓ is a regular set-valued mapping from Ω∗ to ﬁnite subsets of Γ. In particular, the counting
function ♯(ΦΓ(Y )) (counting the intersection number) is a continuous function with positive
integer values. This must be a constant, which is easy to show to be 2I.
Remark 2.9. After ﬁnishing this work, we noticed that Solanes and Teufel have obtained
more general results on similar Crofton formulas for all Lorentz space forms [4].

3 Application to closed spacelike curves in R3
1

In this section we will apply the Crofton formula (21) to the tangent indicatrix of a closed
strong spacelike curve in R3
1.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let γ : (a, b) → R3
1 be a spacelike curve. We call γ a strong spacelike curve
if its osculating plane is spacelike and the curvature κ is positive everywhere. (This includes
closed convex plane curves on a spacelike plane as a special case.)

The Frenet frame {T, N, B} for a strong spacelike curve is deﬁned similar to the Euclidean

case with the following Frenet formula:



−k

k

τ

0
τ




B 
 .

(24)

Here N, B are the normal and the bi-normal vectors, respectively, and τ is the torsion. Note
that the coeﬃcient matrix is no longer skey-symmetric because the inner product here is
not positive deﬁnite.
Remark 3.2. It is easy to see that there exist no regular closed spacelike curves in R3
1 with
timelike normal vector everywhere. Otherwise, the tangent indicatrix will be a timelike
curve on the de Sitter sphere. But on S2

1 there are no such closed timelike curves.

Only for a strong spacelike curve γ (regular and closed) the total curvature has a natural
deﬁnition, which is also the length of its tangent indicatrix T (γ) ⊂ S2
1. By assumption, we
can apply the global Crofton formula (21) to T (γ), which is a spacelike closed curve with
index I = 1.

Proof of the Fenchel theorem 1.1. Because T = γ ′(s) andRγ(T, Y )ds = 0 for any ﬁxed
(timelike) vector Y , this forces that T (γ) can not be contained in one side of any geodesic. So
it must intersect every closed geodesic with at least two intersection points. Now n(Y ⊥) ≥ 2
in (21) for each Y ∈ H2, which implies
Zγ

kds = L(T (γ)) ≤ 2π.

Proof of the generalized Fary-Milnor theorem 1.2. By (21) we need only to show
that the tangent indicatrix has at least four intersections with each closed geodesic, i.e.
n(Y ⊥) ≥ 4 for each Y ∈ H2.
Otherwise, suppose there exists a speciﬁc Y ∈ H2 such that the tangent indicatrix T (γ)
has exactly two intersections with Y ⊥.
In other words, the height function hγ, Y i has
exactly two critical points, one maximum and the other being the minimum, which separate
the curve γ into two arcs. Connecting the points on each arc with the same value of hγ, Y i
by a line segment. This provides a disc with γ as the boundary. This contradicts to the
assumption that γ is a nontrivial knot.

4 General results on the range of the total curvature

After knowing the generalizations of those classical results in the last section, the reader
might be curious about the value distribution of the total curvature for general closed strong
spacelike curves. In this section, we will show that there is neither positive lower bounds
nor upper bounds in the general case.

It is easy to see that the inﬁmum of the total curvature is 0 for closed strong spacelike
curves in R3
1. For concrete examples we can ﬁnd such a γ whose tangent indicatrix is sym-
metric with respect to the Ox1x3-plane and Ox2x3-plane which is a perturbation of a space
quadrilateral formed by four lightlike line segments on S2
1.

The Fenchel-type inequality

8

For strong spacelike curve with index I ≥ 2, a naive guess is that the total curvature
has an upper bound 2Iπ. It turns out surprisingly that the total curvature can be arbitrary
large if there is no further restriction. We realized this possibility only after noticing the
following phenomena:

1. A line of latitude has total length ≥ 2π, and this length can be arbitrarily large;
2. When I ≥ 2 for a closed spacelike curve on S2

1, it is not diﬃcult to make it intersecting

with every geodesic.

A simple example with arbitrarily large total curvature and being strong spacelike, closed,
with index 2 is given below.

Example 4.1. Let γ(θ) = (cos θ, sin θ, h(θ)), θ ∈ [0, 4π], where

h(θ) =

ǫθ,

As a ﬁnal remark, let us compare two concrete examples of closed curves of index I = 2:
a trefoil knot and a clam-shell curve as illustrated below. Notice that a trefoil knot can be
realized as a strong spacelike closed curve with I = 2 in R3

According to the generalized Fary-Milnor theorem 1.2, it must have total curvature less than
4π. Our explanation is that as a nontrivial knot, the tangent indicatrix of a nontrivial knot
is restricted to be close to some spacelike plane which can not be perturbed quite freely.

On the other hand, a clam-shell curve in R3

1 like Example 4.1 can have large total
curvature. It can be divided into two symmetric parts, both approximating a helix in their
major parts; the tangent indicatrix is very close to a half latitude circle in the corresponding
part whose length can be very long.
