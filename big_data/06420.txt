Abstract

We show that the Kontsevich integral on n × n matrices (n < ∞) is the isomonodromic tau function
associated to a 2 × 2 Riemann–Hilbert problem. The approach allows us to gain control of the analysis
of the convergence as n → ∞. By an appropriate choice of the external source matrix in Kontsevich’s
integral, we show that the limit produces the isomonodromic tau function of a special tronqu´ee solution
of the ﬁrst Painlev´e hierarchy, and we identify the solution in terms of the Stokes’ data of the associated
linear problem. We also show that there are several tau functions that are analytic in appropriate sectors of
the space of parameters and that the formal Witten-Kontsevich tau function is the asymptotic expansion
of each of them in their respective sectors, thus providing an analytic tool to analyze its nonlinear Stokes’
phenomenon.

The Kontsevich matrix integral has been introduced in [18] as a tool to prove the Witten conjecture, which
relates the intersection numbers of the Deligne–Mumford moduli space to a speciﬁc solution of the Korteweg–
de Vries hierarchy. This integral is given by the following expression3

where the integral is over the space Hn of (n × n) Hermitian matrices and Y is a diagonal matrix whose
entries yk, k = 1, . . . , n satisfy the condition Re yk > 0 (to ensure convergence); the parameter x was absent
in the original formulation and it is added here for later convenience. Kontsevich proved that the function
Zn(Y ) is a ratio of the Wronskian of Airy functions and the Vandermonde determinant of the eigenvalues of
Y :

(See App. B for a simple proof). A closely related model is the spiked matrix model, with a probability
measure of the form

dµ(M ) ∝ eTr (V (M)+ΛM)dM,

(1.3)

where Λ = diag(λ1, . . . , λn).
If one considers it as a (possibly formal) random model for the eigenvalues
of M then the usual approach of orthogonal polynomials [10] needs to be generalized to multi-orthogonal
polynomials. Then the familiar 2 × 2 Riemann–Hilbert problem for the orthogonal polynomials trades places
with a diﬀerent Riemann Hilbert problem of size r × r, where r is the number of distinct eigenvalues of the
matrix Y and the orthogonality is replaced by multiple orthogonality [2]. In general (except for special cases
[8]), the case with n distinct eigenvalues leads necessarily to a Riemann–Hilbert problem of size n + 1. Our
goal is however a diﬀerent one: we are interested in the integral (1.1) itself.

The equation (1.2) is the key step to prove that the Kontsevich integral is a tau function (in the formal
sense of Sato [22]) for the KdV hierarchy, where the eigenvalues yk plays the role of Miwa variables (see eq.
(1.16)). The ﬁrst goal of this paper is to identify the Kontsevich integral with another type of tau function, of

3 We normalize the variables of integration diﬀerently from [18]. See Rem. 2.6 for the precise comparison.

the type introduced by Jimbo Miwa and Ueno [17, 16] in the study of isomonodromic deformations of linear
ODEs; the so called isomonodromic tau function. Concretely, in our situation we start from the “bare system”

0 (cid:21) Ψ0(λ; x).

The function Ψ0 satisﬁes also an ODE in x (of identical form, in fact) and can be written explicitly in terms
of Airy functions (Section 3.1).
In this case the compatibility of the derivatives in x, λ is a trivial matter.
We then proceed with a “dressing”, namely, a discrete Schlesinger transformation in which the monodromy
data (Stokes’ matrices) are preserved but we allow Ψn to have n poles at the points {λ1, . . . , λn} := ~λ with
λk = y2
k, k = 1, . . . , n. As a result we obtain compatibility equations for the derivatives with respect to all
the spectral data of Y and a set of PDEs

Here a(n)(x; ~λ) is a given function appearing in the asymptotic expansion of Ψn(λ; x, ~λ) at inﬁnity (see (2.4)
and (2.5)). The residue matrices Aj(x; ~λ) are determined by the condition that the local monodromy around
λk is trivial and that their eigenvalues are {0,−1} (see Remark 2.3 for explanation).
In the speciﬁc case of
our Lax system (1.5)–(1.7) the Jimbo–Miwa–Ueno deﬁnition of tau function translates to the following set of
ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations

Theorem 1.1. Let τn(x; ~λ) be the isomonodromic tau function for the isomonodromic system (1.5, 1.6, 1.7).

Extension of the Kontsevich matrix integral to arbitrary sectors. The right side of (1.2) is an entire
function of the yj’s and hence one may be tempted to simply extend it analytically to the left planes of the
variables; however we now contend that we need to deﬁne it diﬀerently. To explain the rationale we remind
the reader that the interpretation of Zn(x; Y ) as a generating function requires that it admits a regular4
asymptotic expansion as yj → ∞. Using the well-known asymptotic expansion of the Airy function (Ai) in
the sector | arg λ| < π we see that

3

2 = −y3 if Re y ≤ 0 (and we use the principal roots). Therefore (1.2), as
where we have used that (y2)
written, cannot possibly admit a regular asymptotic expansion if yj → ∞ in the sector Re yj ≤ 0 for some j.
The reader familiar with the Stokes’ phenomenon of the Airy function will see that the way to recover
a regular expansion in the left half plane is to use either Ai(ω±1y2) instead. To this end we introduce the
following notation

Deﬁnition 1.2. For any partition of the set Y of the eigenvalues of Y into three disjoint sets Y (s), s = 0, 1, 2
of respective cardinality n0, n1, n2 (n = n0 + n1 + n2), we consider the following determinant which we call

The generalized Kontsevich integrals (1.14) reduce to (1.2) if Y (0) = Y, Y (1) = ∅ = Y (2).

Theorem 1.3.
[1] The function Zn(x;Y (0),Y (1),Y (2)) (1.14) and the isomonodromic tau function τn associated to the
Riemann–Hilbert problem 2.1 are related by

x3

(1.15)

with the identiﬁcation yi = √λi if Re(yi) > 0 and yj = −√µj if Re(yj) ≤ 0, all roots principal.
[2] The expression (1.14) admits a regular asymptotic expansion if the variables yj’s tend to inﬁnity provided
that arg Y (ν) ⊂ Sν with the sectors Sν deﬁned in (1.13)
[3] This asymptotic expansion is independent of the assignment of the variables to the diﬀerent groups Y (ν)
or Y (eν) if they belong to the overlap of the sectors Sν ∩ Seν .

The points [2], [3] of Thm. 1.3 follows simply from the fact that e

3 y3+xyAiν,eν (y2 + x) have the same
regular asymptotic expansion if |y| → ∞ and arg y ∈ Sν∩Seν . Indeed, the analysis of the asymptotic behaviour
Aiν (y2) admits the same regular (nontrivial) expansion in
for y → ∞ for the Airy function shows that e
integer inverse powers of y’s if and only if y tends to inﬁnity in the corresponding sectors Sν (see [1], 10.4.59).
In particular, if all yj’s tend to inﬁnity in the right half-plane and we assign them all to S0, then we get
(1.1) and hence this expansion is the formal expansion that generates the intersection numbers of tautological
classes as explained in [18].

The formulation of the result in terms of isomonodromic deformation may be more widely recognizable by
the readership, but it is not the way we want to set up its proof. In particular this formulation makes it hard
to analyze the situation when the size of the matrix integral in (1.1) (the number of poles in (1.5)) tends to
inﬁnity.

We will

instead reformulate the isomonodromic system (1.5, 1.6, 1.7) directly in terms of a suitable
Riemann–Hilbert problem (2.1), thus displaying explicitly its monodromy data. This reformulation allows to
handle rigorously a limit as n → ∞.

The limit n → ∞: ﬁrst Painlev´e hierarchy.

More precisely, in these variables, U (x; T ) := ∂2
2 log Zn(x; Y ) satisﬁes the KdV hierarchy with the normal-

ization adopted in [24]. This particular solution of the KdV hierarchy was known by physicists even before the
formulation of Witten’s conjecture and its proof by Kontsevich [18]. In the physics literature, this is referred
to as the partition function of 2D topological gravity (see the references in [12]).
It can be deﬁned as the

solution satisfying the initial value condition U (x, 0) = x. As originally discovered by Douglas [13] using the
so–called string equation (see Section 2.1 below, keeping in mind that there the normalization is diﬀerent from
the Witten’s one, see Remark 2.6), the Witten–Kontsevich solution of the KdV hierarchy satisfy an inﬁnite
number of ODE’s in T0 (or x, which is the same) known as the Painlev´e I hierarchy, and where the higher
Ti’s play the role of parameters. Indeed this is very close to the procedure of Flaschka and Newell [14] who
deduce the Painlev´e II hierarchy as a self–similar reduction of the modiﬁed KdV one. To see brieﬂy how it
works, recall that, in the Witten’s normalization, the equations of the KdV hierarchy are written as

Deriving once (1.19) by T0 and substituting the integrated version of (1.17) (integration constants are seen
to be equal to zero) one obtains the set of ODE’s in T0, depending on the parameters {Ti},

Ti+1Ri+1 = 0.

More precisely, putting Tj = 0 when j ≥ k + 1, the k-th member of the Painlev´e I hierarchy is obtained.
Making sense of the formal statement saying that the Kontsevich matrix model Zn(x; Y ) satisfy the Painlev´e
I hierarchy requires a limit n → ∞ because, for ﬁxed n, the variables Tj are not even independent. This
leaves open the question as to what kind of convergence we should expect. Also, Zn(x; Y ) is usually treated
as a formal series, while it would be interesting to analyze the analytic properties of these solutions of the
hierarchy. Thus the issue becomes:

Question 1.4. How to choose a sequence Y = Yn of variables Yn = ny(n)

partition into three subsets in such a way that generalized Kontsevich integral (1.14) converges to a tau
function of the N -th member of the ﬁrst Painlev´e hierarchy? Which particular solution does it converge and

(1.23)

We then address Question 1.4 for the subsequence n = r(2N + 1).

Theorem 1.5. Fix N ∈ N. Partition the Yκ’s into three (cyclically) consecutive disjoint groups belonging to
the sectors S0,1,2 (1.13) and assign them to Y (0,1,2). Deﬁne k+ ≥ k0 ≥ k−, k+ > k− as follows

• k0 = (number of Yκ’s in the second quadrant that we assign to Y (2)) - (number of Yκ’s in the third

quadrant that we assign to Y (1))

• k− = −(cid:4) N
• k+ =(cid:4) N

2(cid:5) + ( number of Yκ’s in the ﬁrst quadrant that we assign to Y (1) );
2(cid:5) - ( number of Yκ’s in the fourth quadrant that we assign to Y (2) );

Then

1. the formula (1.14) converges, with rate of convergence O(n−∞) as n → ∞, to the tau function τ (x; t)
of the special tronqu´ee solution of the N -th member of the P I hierarchy associated to the RHP 3.5
with the chosen (k+, k0, k−)

(2N + 1)tLN [u(x; t)] + u(x; t) + x = 0 ,

u(x, t) := 2∂2

x ln τ (x; t).

(1.24)

2. All these particular solution u(x; t) have no poles for |t| suﬃciently small within an open sector of width
at least π containing arg(t) = 0 and they diﬀer by exponentially small terms as |t| → 0 within the
common sector where they have no poles. If k0 = 0, then the width of this sector is at least π on either
sides of arg t = 0.

3. The limit at t = 0, from within this common sector, of the derivatives of arbitrary order equal those of

the formal topological solution.

For the proof see Sec. 3.4. Here LN [u] is the Lenard diﬀerential polynomial in u(x) deﬁned in (2.24).
The idea behind the binning of the groups Yκ into the three disjoint subsets Y (0,1,2) of Theorem 1.3 and
1.5 is as follows; referring to the Figures 1, 2 we see that some groups can only be assigned to one Y (ν)
because they belong to only one Sν, while others fall in the intersection between two diﬀerent sectors S0,1,2
and can be assigned to either. The diﬀerent choices are reﬂected in the choices of the parameters k+, k0, k−
that characterize the particular tronqu´ee solution in the Riemann–Hilbert problem 3.5. The Theorem 1.5
is therefore a ﬁrst foray in the study of the nonlinear Stokes’ phenomenon for the Witten–Kontsevich tau
function.

Remark 1.6. From the recurrence relation (2.24) we can see that the Lenard polynomials LN [u] are homo-
geneous of degree 2N under the rescaling U (X) = α2u(α−1X). Setting U (X, t) := t
2N +1 X, t), we
obtain the equation

2N +1 u(t− 1

2

(2N + 1)LN [U (X; t)] + t− 3

2N +1 U (X; t) + X = 0

(1.25)

and this shows that u(x, t) is single-valued on the Riemann surface of t
to have no poles in a sector of amplitude 2π or even bigger.

2N +1 . This explains how it is possible

In Thm. 1.5 we restricted ourselves to the subsequence n = r(2N + 1) only because of the way we

constructed the rational approximation of e2tλ
; to extend the statement to the whole sequence one would
have to consider the Pad´e approximants to e2tz2N +1
directly (of which, the polynomials Pr(2tz2N +1) are a
subsequence). More generally, the full ﬂedged member of the Painlev´e hierarchy as in (1.20) would require
the analog of the estimate (3.39) for the location of the zeroes and the estimate of the remainder term of the
. We regard this issue as a technical one; clearly the general phenomenon

2 Riemann–Hilbert formulation of the isomonodromic system

In this section we introduce the Riemann–Hilbert problem whose associated tau function coincides with the
(generalized) Kontsevich integral (1.14), and discuss the limit to some particular solutions of the Painlev´e
I (PI) hierarchy. Given an arbitrary set of n points (~λ, ~µ) = (λ1, . . . , λn1 , µ1, . . . , µn2 ) let us consider the
function

It is implied that the rays are chosen in a suﬃciently generic way so that no poles of d(λ) lie on ̟0 and
no poles of d−1(λ) lie on ̟±. As a matter of fact the problem can be posed on arbitrary (non-intersecting)
contours issuing from the origin and extending to inﬁnity as long as the asymptotic directions at inﬁnity are
the ones indicated.

Remark 2.2 (Gauge arbitrariness). The asymptotic condition (2.4) implies a gauge ﬁxing; indeed we could
multiply Γn on the left by a constant matrix of the form 1 + cσ−, and this would not change the jump
conditions. However that coeﬃcient matrix of λ− 1
2 in the expansion (2.4) would be changed by the addition
of a term proportional to σ1. In other words the requirement that the O(λ− 1
2 ) term is proportional to σ3 is
part of the normalization condition at inﬁnity (otherwise there would be a one–parameter family of solutions).
It is an exercise left to the reader to verify that the solution, if it exists, is unique under this normalization.

We now explain how the Riemann–Hilbert problem 2.1 provides the precise (generalized) monodromy data
for the isomonodromic approach discussed in the introduction, extended here to the case of (~λ, ~µ) relevant for
the generalised Kontsevich model. The matrix

D(λ) = D(λ; ~λ, ~µ) :=

and the function a(n)(x; ~λ, ~µ) is deﬁned (implicitly) above by the equation (2.4).

These equations, together, represent a system of “monodromy preserving” deformation of the rational

ODE (2.7), in the sense of [17].

10

Remark 2.3. While a general rational connection ∂λ− A with A as in (2.7) has nontrivial monodromy around
the Fuchsian singularities of (1.5), our particular case corresponds to a situation where the monodromy is
trivial; more speciﬁcally, the residue matrices Aj(x; ~λ, ~µ) and Bk(x; ~λ, ~µ) have all eigenvalues 0 and ±1, since
they were produced adding zeros and poles of order one in the ﬁrst or the second column of the jump matrix
Mn in (2.3). Thus the Fuchsian ODE is “resonant” [23]. The no-monodromy condition is a special constraint
that determines the particular solution relevant to our problem. This indicates how the Riemann–Hilbert
problem (2.1) yields the isomonodromic system (2.7), (2.8), (2.9) and (2.10).

In this extended case the Jimbo–Miwa–Ueno deﬁnition of tau function translates to the following set of

ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations

∂λk ln τn(x; ~λ, ~µ) = res
λ=λk
∂x ln τn(x; ~λ, ~µ) = res

generalizing straightforwardly the formulæ (1.10). Equations (2.13), as it is customary in the Jimbo–Miwa–
Ueno setting, determine the τ function up to a multiplicative factor that may depend on the monodromy data
of the problem. To address this ambiguity, the deﬁnition was generalized in [3] (with a correction in [5]) to
one that applies also to general Riemann–Hilbert problems:

∂ ln τJM U =ZΣ

(2.14)

where Σ = R− ∪ ̟0 ∪ ̟+ ∪ ̟−. Since the jump on R− in the Riemann–Hilbert problem is independent of
parameters, the integration in (2.14) extends only on the three rays ̟0,±.

In this case the two deﬁnitions are completely equivalent but we will continue using the second one.
Note that, however, the function τ is only deﬁned up to multiplicative constants. In the cases where explicit
integration of the above equation is possible, the integration constant will be tacitly set to zero, without
further comment. Therefore we can restate the Theorem 1.3 in the form

Theorem 2.4. The Kontsevich integral Zn(x;Y (0),Y (1),Y (2)) in (1.14) satisﬁes

2.1 The Riemann–Hilbert problem for the ﬁrst Painlev´e hierarchy

In order to discuss the various solutions of the ﬁrst Painlev´e hierarchy, we need to review the relevant Riemann–
Hilbert problem ([7] , page 365). The Riemann–Hilbert problem of the N -th member of the ﬁrst Painlev´e
hierarchy is constructed as follows; deﬁne the phase function

rays ̟ν (oriented towards inﬁnity) and R− (oriented towards the origin) and such that

The connection with the equations of the hierarchy arises as follows. The Tau function of a solution corre-
sponding to the above data is deﬁned in [17] as

where the residue is to be intended as a formal one (the formal series in the residue turns out to have only
integer powers of λ and the residue is the coeﬃcient of the power λ−1 of the expression in the bracket). The
function

u(x, t3, t5, . . . , t2N +1) := 2∂xa(x, t3, t5, . . . , t2N +1) = 2∂2

x ln τP 1N ((x, t3, t5, . . . , t2N +1)

NXk=1

The Stokes’ parameters ~s = (s−N , . . . , sN ) (subject to (2.19)) parametrize the solution space of (2.23).

In addition to the ODE (2.23) above, u satisﬁes also

u = u(t), t = (t1, t3, t5, . . .).

(2.25)

Remark 2.6. The equations (2.23), (2.24) and (2.25), up to a rescaling and a shift of T1 = t3, correspond
to (1.20), (1.18), (1.17). The source of the diﬀerence comes from the normalization we have used for the

matrix integration variable in (1.1); indeed Kontsevich writes the integrand as exp(cid:2) i

from which we conclude that the relationship between our M, Y and his X, Λ is

6 Tr X 3 − 1

2 Tr XΛX(cid:3),

M = 2− 1

3 X, Y = 2− 1

3 Λ.

(2.26)

This translates to the following scaling relationship for the times (comparing our phase function (2.16) with
the phase function in [6], eq. (1.9), which yields the correct normalizations)

In particular our t1 = x corresponds to −2
Remark 2.7. The equation (2.23) is the statement that the tau function of the solution to RHP 2.5 is
the reduction of a Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) tau function satisfying the string equation [P, L] = 1, where
2k+1
L := ∂2
,
see for instance [19]. The formulation of the Painlev´e I hierarchy in terms of the string equation is originally
due to Douglas [13].

∂x2 + 2u(x, t1, . . . , tk) is the Lax operator for the KdV hierarchy and P :=PN

Example 2.8. The case N = 2 corresponds to the ﬁrst Painlev´e equation and the special solution is the
famous tri-tronqu´ee solution [15]. Also, for all even N these are the solutions (conjecturally) relevant to the
study of the “higher order” critical behavior of the largest eigenvalue in certain random matrix models [7].

We shall need also the formula for the higher derivatives of ln τP 1N (t); this formula is explained in [6] in the
more general context of the KdV hierarchy (of which the Painlev´e I hierarchy is a reduction).

3 Kontsevich’s integral as isomonodromic tau function

This section contains the proof of the main theorems 1.3 and 1.5, presented respectively in the subsections
3.3 and 3.4.

3.1 The bare solution: Airy RHP

The RHP 2.1 for d ≡ 1 (n = 0) corresponds to an explicitly solvable problem involving Airy functions: we call
it the bare solution. This is also the solution of the Painlev´e hierarchy 2.5 with N = 1 and t3 = 2

By construction, A(ζ) solves a Riemann–Hilbert problem with jumps indicated in the left pane of Fig. 3.
Consequently one can check that Γ0(λ; x) solves the Riemann–Hilbert problem 2.1 for n = 0. The only point
worth remarking is that the jump contours of A should be preemptively translated by x so that the jump
contours of Γ0 coincide exactly with rays issuing from the origin.

The initial tau function. The isomonodromic tau function of the RHP for n = 0 (which is a function solely
of x) is computed directly from the Japanese formula (1.10) (using (3.8)) which yields directly

∂x ln τ0(x) = −

x2
4 ⇒ τ0(x) = e− x3

12 .

(3.9)

It is worth remarking that τ0(x) is nowhere vanishing: this is a signal that the RHP (2.1) for n = 0 is always
solvable.

the one form (3.10) is the total diﬀerential of the logarithm of the tau function (see also equation (2.14)).

Theorem 3.2. The eﬀect of the dressing of the jump matrices Mn(λ; t, ~λ, ~µ) := D−1(λ)M (λ; t)D(λ) on the

A proof by induction can be extracted from [16] but we will provide a diﬀerent one which relies upon prior
work in [4]. We point out that the setting of Theorem 3.2 is precisely the one relevant to the Riemann–Hilbert
problem 2.1, where M (λ; t) is the jump matrix of the Airy Riemann–Hilbert problem for (3.6).

3.3 Proof of the main theorems

We now return to the original setting and Γ0 as given in (3.6); in this case we can further simplify det G and
see that it provides the main ingredient for the Witten-Kontsevich tau integral (1.1) and extensions (1.14).

The isomonodromic tau function τn is deﬁned up to a multiplicative constant and therefore we can claim
(using the expression for τ0(x) in (3.9))

The proof is now complete.

Remark 3.4. The variables τn depends on, can be denoted as ~λ, ~µ or by yj = √λj, yk = −√µk (in
the right/left half-planes of the y–plane). Furthermore, since the determinant in (3.15) is split into blocks
depending on the index ν in Aiν, we can equivalently denote the dependence as τn(x;Y (0),Y (1),Y (2)). This
is the way it was presented in the statement of Theorem 1.3.

We start with the following specializations of Riemann–Hilbert problem 2.5 as indicated below.

Riemann-Hilbert Problem 3.5. Choose three integers k+, k0, k− ∈ (cid:8)−(cid:4) N−1

Proposition 3.6.
[1] Let Γ(λ; t, x) be the solution of the Riemann–Hilbert problem (3.5) with a choice of integers ~k =
(k0, k+, k−) such that

Then for x ranging in a compact set the solution Γ is analytic for t in a sector {|t| < r, arg(t) ∈ (a, b)}
containing arg t = 0, that depends on the choice of ~k and has width at least π. For the case k0 = 0 the sector
contains the sector arg(t) ∈ (−π, π).
[2] This solution, for t → 0, converges to the Airy parametrix (3.6) and also its tau function τP 1N (t) deﬁned
by (2.21) (with t1 = x, t2N +1 = t and all other tj = 0), converges to e
[3] The derivatives of arbitrary order with respect to t2N +1 = t, t1 = x of τP 1N (x, t) also converge as |t| → 0
in the same sector to the derivatives of the topological solution.

Figure 4: The jumps of the Riemann–Hilbert problem
3.5.
In the example N = 11 and the width of each
darker sector is 2π/23. The rays ̟± must extend to
inﬁnity within the sector shaded in both hues, while ̟0
within the white sectors. In this example there are ﬁve
choices for the ray ̟0 and four for each ̟±. Each
choice determines a particular solution of the equation
(1.24) of the P 1N hierarchy.
In the example above
(which is relevant to the setting of Theorem 1.5), shift-
ing arg t by ±π one of the two dark sectors adjacent
to R− disappears on the second sheet of √λ and one
of the rays ̟± is pinched.
If we choose ̟0 as indi-
cated by the lighter shade, then we can rotate arg t up
to a smaller angle than −π because the ray ̟0 will be
forced to move in the sector S1, but we can still rotate
up to π.
In general, the reader can convince oneself
that the minimum amplitude of rotation of arg t is in-
deed π in the positive and/or negative direction, and
thus all these solutions of the hierarchy converge to the
Airy parametrix exponentially fast as |t| → 0 and arg(t)
in a sector of width at least π that contains the positive
real t–axis.

Proof. [1] The matrix Γ0 in Def. 3.1 solves the RHP (2.1) with d ≡ 1. The three rays ωR+ can be rotated
to rays ̟j = eiθj R+, j = 0,±1 within the range (3.2).
Indeed, within these ranges the jump matrices in Fig. (3) are of the form 1 +O(|λ|−∞) as |λ| → ∞ since

On the other hand the well-posedness of the Riemann–Hilbert problem 2.1 for Γ requires that the rays

satisfy (3.22) so that e−tλ

is decaying along ̟0 and etλ

is decaying along ̟±, see Fig. 4.

In general there are several possible choices of k0, k± in (3.22) that satisfy both ranges (3.2), (3.22); for a
given choice of rays, the conditions will remain satisﬁed within a certain maximal open sector in the t–plane;
it should be noted that diﬀerent choices of k0,± lead to inequivalent Riemann–Hilbert problems and solutions
of the ﬁrst Painlev´e hierarchy (see below); in particular the poles of the corresponding Painlev´e transcendent
depend on this choice.

Let us assume now that we make one such choice of sector and consider the RHP for the matrix E with

jumps on ̟0,±1 as follows

Along the rays in the chosen sector, the matrices Γ0, Γ−1

E(λ; t, x) = 1 +

Most importantly, for |t| suﬃciently small, the existence of the solution E (and its analyticity with respect
to the parameters t, x) is guaranteed by standard arguments. By construction of the jump relations (3.24),
(3.25), the matrix E(λ; t, x)Γ0(λ; x) solves a Riemann–Hilbert problem with the same jumps as Γ(λ; t, x)
but in a diﬀerent gauge (see Remark 2.2). By a left multiplication with λ–independent matrix and by the
uniqueness of the solution of the Riemann–Hilbert problem 2.1, we deduce that
Γ(λ; t, x) = (1 − (E1(t, x))12σ−)E(λ; t, x)Γ0(λ; x) .

(3.28)

The left multiplier is crafted so as to guarantee the same gauge as Γ at inﬁnity (see Rem. 2.2). We conclude
that Γ(λ; t, x) is analytic in the speciﬁed domain. The width of the sectors is explained by way of example in
the caption of Fig. 4.
[2] Since E → 1, we deduce that the tau function for Γ(λ; t, x) deﬁned by (2.21) converges to that of Γ0 as
given in (3.9).
[3] By the same argument, using (2.28) we conclude that all derivatives of ln τP 1N converge as |t| → 0 within
the common sector, to the same expression (2.28) evaluated using the Airy parametrix Γ0. These are [6]
precisely the derivatives of the topological solution of KdV (note that we are using a diﬀerent normalization
of the time t from loc. cit. but this is inconsequential to our discussion).

On the dashed arcs the jumps cancel each other and hence E is continuous across them.

3.4.1 Equivalence to all orders of diﬀerent solutions: proof of Thm. 1.5[2,3].

Proposition 3.6 has already established Theorem 1.24[2] and part of Theorem 1.24[3].
It remains to show
that two solutions of the Riemann–Hilbert problem 3.5 (and the corresponding tau functions) with diﬀerent
choices of ~k = (k0, k+, k−) diﬀer by exponentially small terms as |t| → 0 as long as the corresponding sectors
appearing in the Proposition 3.6 have non-empty overlap. See Fig. 6 illustrating a typical such setup.
The proof is a simple application of perturbation analysis of Riemann–Hilbert problems; the ratio of two
solutions with diﬀerent choices ~k1, ~k2 has a jump which approaches the identity in any Lp (1 ≤ p ≤ ∞) at an
exponential rate in 1
We need to analyze the signs of the real part of the phase function ϑ (3.21) as |t| → 0. Treating the term
with t in ϑ as a perturbation, it is clear that for |t| suﬃciently small the signs of Re ϑ(λ; t, x) are dominated

consider the RHP for the matrix E with jumps only on the union of the rays γ1,2 and the arc Π as shown in

the ﬁgure and with the jump matrix given by 1 + eϑ(λ;t,x)eΓ(λ; t, x)σ−eΓ−1(λ; t, x). We know from Prop. 3.6
that eΓ(λ; t, x) tends to the Airy parametrix as |t| → 0 in a small sector around R+ uniformly with respect to
λ on the Riemann sphere and hence it remains bounded as |t| → 0. The Lp norms of eϑ on the two rays are

uniformly with respect to 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. By standard arguments [10] on small norm Riemann Hilbert problems,
we conclude that E converges to the identity on the Riemann sphere, at the same exponential rate (3.32)
Then, by the same argument used in Proposition 3.6, we conclude that

Γ(λ; t, x) = (1 − (E1(t, x))12σ−)E(λ; t, x)eΓ(λ; x)

(with E1(t, x) similar as in (3.27)) and henceeΓ(λ; t, x), Γ(λ, t, x) diﬀer from each other by exponentially small

terms as |t| → 0 in a small sector around R+.
In particular, the ratio of the corresponding tau functions
deﬁned via (2.21) will also tend to unity exponentially fast as |t| → 0; therefore, the asymptotic expansion of
the logarithms of the two tau functions in powers of t will be identical in the overlapping sector. Since the
estimates are uniform with respect to x in a compact set (we used |x| < K in the estimates (3.29), (3.31)),
the coeﬃcients of these expansions must also be analytic in x at least in the same domain.

to the identity in all Lp norms (1 ≤ p ≤ ∞) as r → ∞, and hence so does E; the rate of convergence is the

̟0 ranges in a sector where there are zeroes of the numerator in F0(λ) and since the zeroes and poles of the
numerator/denominator are contained in disjoint sectors, the function F0(λ) is bounded and analytic along
the ray ̟0. Similarly for the other two rays.

Then, by the same token used in Proposition 3.6 we must have

Γn(λ; t, x) =(cid:18)1 − E1(t, x, n)21σ−(cid:19)E(λ; t, x, n)Γ(λ; t, x)

(3.46)

and we conclude that the tau function for the problem Γn (i.e. Zn) converges to the tau function of Γ. (cid:3)

A Proof of Thm. 3.2

Let Γn = Γn(λ; t, ~λ, ~µ) denote the solution of the Riemann–Hilbert problem with the jump matrices Mn(λ; t, ~λ, ~µ).
It can be written as Γn(λ) = R(λ)Γ0(λ)D(λ) where R(λ) is a suitable rational matrix and D(λ) as in (2.6).
Indeed the matrix ratio

R(λ) := Γn(λ)D(λ)−1Γ0(λ)−1

(A.1)

is seen to have no jumps on Σ. It clearly has at most simple poles at λ = λk, µk and decays algebraically at
inﬁnity. By Liouville’s theorem R(λ) is a rational function.

We now seek a set of characterizing conditions for the matrix R as a solution of a given Riemann–Hilbert

problem. To this end let r > 0 be suﬃciently small so that all the disks below are disjoint and deﬁne:

(A.4)

We shall use interchangeably R±(λ) for the boundary values or the restriction of the solution R(λ) to

D±, respectively. We prove the following:
Proposition A.2. The matrix R(λ) in (A.1) is a rational matrix–valued function with simple poles at λ =
λk, µk. Restricted to D− it coincides with R−(λ) in the Riemann–Hilbert problem A.1, up to a left constant
multiplier of the form 1 − ia(n)σ−. In particular, the matrix R−(λ) extends to a rational function of λ.
Proof. We already proved that R(λ) is a rational function. Moreover near λk, µk we have, from (A.1),

R(λ) = O(1)(λ − λk)−E22Γ−1

0 (λ),

R(λ) = O(1)(λ − µk)−E11 Γ−1

0 (λ)

(A.5)

and thus R(λ) must have simple poles at λk, µk (here O(1) stands for a locally analytic matrix function, with
analytic inverse). Now in order to establish the connection between R and R we have to study the behaviour
at λ = ∞. We multiply both sides of Γn = RΓ0D (D deﬁned in (2.6)) as follows

Because of the asymptotic behavior (2.4) the left side admits a regular expansion at λ = ∞ with leading
coeﬃcient of the form C0 = 1 + ia(n)σ−.

Hence we deﬁne R(λ) as

R(λ) =



(cid:0)1 − ia(n)σ−(cid:1) Γn(λ)D−1(λ)(λ − λk)E22 λ ∈ Dk, k = 1, . . . , n2,

λ ∈ D∞,
λ ∈ D−.

It is easy to check that R, deﬁned in this way, satisﬁes the jump conditions in (A.3) and, moreover, also the
asymptotic condition at inﬁnity. The identiﬁcation (up to a normalization constant) between R− and R is
read oﬀ directly from the last line of (A.7).

The jump matrix J(λ) admits (formal) meromorphic extension in the interior of D (by construction) and
moreover the total index of det J(λ) around ∂D is zero. Under these conditions, the analysis in Appendix B
of [4] applies. We brieﬂy remind it with notation adapted to the current use.

Let H± denote the vector space of (formally) analytic valued row-vectors in D± (respectively) and C± the
Cauchy projection operator; consider the following two (ﬁnite dimensional, see B.14 in loc. cit.) subspaces of
