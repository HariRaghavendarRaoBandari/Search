ABSTRACT
Forecasts in cosmology, both with Monte-Carlo Markov-chain methods and with the Fisher
matrix formalism, depend on the choice of the ﬁducial model because both the signal strength
of any observable as well as the model nonlinearities linking observables to cosmological
parameters vary in the general case. In this paper we propose a method for extrapolating
Fisher-forecasts across the space of cosmological parameters by constructing a suitable ba-
sis. We demonstrate the validity of our method with constraints on a standard dark energy
model extrapolated from a ΛCDM-model, as can be expected from 2-bin weak lensing to-
mography with a Euclid-like survey, in the parameter pairs (Ωm, σ8), (Ωm, w0) and (w0, wa).
Our numerical results include very accurate extrapolations across a wide range of cosmo-
logical parameters in terms of shape, size and orientation of the parameter likelihood, and a
decomposition of the change of the likelihood contours into modes, which are straightforward
to interpret in a geometrical way. We ﬁnd that in particular the variation of the dark energy
ﬁgure of merit is well captured by our formalism.
Key words: gravitational lensing: weak – dark energy – large-scale structure of Universe.

INTRODUCTION

Forecasting techniques based on the Fisher-formalism are ubiqui-
tous in cosmology: They are straightforward to implement, they are
commonly used to investigate to what extent cosmological mod-
els can be tested with surveys, and they are employed to optimise
survey design and to maximise sensitivity on certain cosmological
parameters. They have been applied to forecasts from the cosmic
microwave background (Perotto et al. 2006b; Elsner & Wandelt
2012) including cross correlations (Pearson & Zahn 2014), tomo-
graphic weak lensing (Hu 1999, 2002; Jain & Taylor 2003; Takada
& Jain 2004; Takada & White 2004; Huterer & White 2005; Amara
& Réfrégier 2007; Schäfer & Heisenberg 2012), 3d weak cosmic
shear (Castro et al. 2005; Heavens 2003), weak gravitational lens-
ing of the cosmic microwave background (Perotto et al. 2006a;
Ishak et al. 2004; Santos et al. 2013), other secondary anisotropies
including the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich and integrated Sachs-Wolfe ef-
fects, cluster cosmology (Hu 2003; Marian et al. 2009; Khedekar &
Majumdar 2010; Khedekar et al. 2010; Allen et al. 2011; Pillepich
et al. 2012; Khedekar & Majumdar 2013; Sartoris et al. 2015),
galaxy clustering including baryon acoustic oscillations (White
et al. 2009; Seo & Eisenstein 2003), supernova cosmology (Efs-
tathiou 1999) and many more.

At the core of the Fisher-formalism (Tegmark et al. 1997; Coe
2009; Bassett et al. 2009, 2011) is the approximation of the pa-
rameter likelihood with a Gaussian function. Forecasting of errors
and degeneracies needs to assume a ﬁducial model, which is set to
be yield the maximal likelihood, and one proceeds to compute the

curvature of the logarithmic likelihood, which after averaging over
all possible realisations of the data, quantiﬁes the inverse errors on
the parameters one intends to measure. The results of the Fisher-
formalism hinge on the choice of a ﬁducial model, which sets the
signal strength and determines how nonlinearities in the model are
approximated. Both eﬀects lead to variations of the Fisher matrix
across parameter space, resulting in discussions in large consortia
about using common ﬁducials. This is an important issue as some
choices of parameters can exclude certain physical eﬀects, for in-
stance dark energy perturbations cease as the equation of state w
approaches w = −1.

In this paper we intend to investigate the dependence of
Fisher-forecasts on the choice of the reference cosmology and pro-
pose a method to describe and quantify variations of the Fisher-
matrix across parameter space. As an application we consider con-
straints on the cosmological parameters Ωm, σ8, w0 and wa from
2-bin weak lensing tomography with Euclid1 , but our method can
in principle be applied to any Gaussian forecasting problem in cos-
mology. Lensing tomography makes the best use of weak lensing
data by separating the inﬂuence of cosmological parameters on
the signal at diﬀerent redshifts. Euclid’s weak lensing signal will
be quite strong: Integrated over all multipoles including nonlinear
scales and in a full tomographic setup with many redshift bins the
signal will have a signiﬁcance of close to 1000σ, allowing sub-
percent precision on cosmological parameters.

The ﬁducial cosmological model is a spatially ﬂat ΛCDM-
cosmology, with speciﬁc parameter choices Ωm = 0.25, ns = 1,

σ8 = 0.8 and h = 0.7, in comparison to generic quintessence
models whose equation of state is parameterised by a linear time-
evolution in w0 and wa, in contrast to the ﬁducial cosmology, where
w0 = −1 and wa = 0. Throughout the paper we assume the sum-
mation convention implying automatic summation over repeated
indices.

After a summary of cosmology in Sect. 2 and weak gravi-
tational lensing in Sect. 3 we outline the statistical methods in
Sects. 4 and 5. We summarise and discuss our results in Sect. 6.

3 WEAK GRAVITATIONAL LENSING

In weak gravitational lensing one investigates the action of gravita-
tional tidal ﬁelds on the shape of distant galaxies by the distortion
of light bundles (for reviews, please refer to Bartelmann & Schnei-
der 2001; Hoekstra & Jain 2008; Huterer 2010; Bartelmann 2010).
The lensing potential ψi is given by a projection integral,

As a line of sight-integrated quantity, the projected potential con-
tains less information than the sourcing ﬁeld Φ. In order to par-
tially regain that information, one commonly divides the sample
of lensed galaxies into nbin redshift bins and computes the lensing
signal for each of the bins i separately. Therefore, one deﬁnes the
tomographic lensing eﬃciency function Gi(χ),

Combining all results one obtains the angular spectra Cψ,i j((cid:96)) of the

Weak lensing convergence is related to the lensing potential by
applying the Laplace operator, therefore its spectra is equal to

tain a constant shape noise contribution σ2

The spectra Cψ,i j((cid:96)) is not zero for i (cid:44) j leading to a non-diagonal
covariance matrix in the Fisher-matrix construction. We chose the
bin edges in a way that they contain identical fractions of the total
number 4π fsky ¯n of galaxies, with the number ¯n of galaxies per unit
solid angle and the sky coverage of the survey fsky.

4 STATISTICS

Full sky tomographic weak lensing surveys provide a measurement
of 2(cid:96) + 1 statistically independent modes for each multipole (cid:96), and
independent multipoles in the case of homogeneous and isotropic
random ﬁelds, from which constraints on cosmological parameters
can be derived (Tegmark et al. 1997; Hu 2002). The likelihood that

a model ˆCψ((cid:96)) is able to reproduce the set(cid:8)ψ(cid:96)m,i

from the fact that both the cosmic structure as well as the noise are
Gaussian random ﬁelds. This assumption is limited to linear struc-
ture formation, where all Fourier-modes evolve in a statistically in-
dependent way. Despite the fact that the line of sight-integrations
reduce the amount of non-Gaussianity in the lensing observable due
to the central limit theorem, non-Gaussian covariances lead to mis-
estimations of parameters, as shown by Scoccimarro et al. (1999);
Kayo et al. (2013). Our model for nonlinear structures eﬀectively
increases the variance of the ﬁelds without accounting for the devi-
ation from Gaussianity.

with the dimension n of the parameter space and the distances ∆xµ

The characteristics of Euclid’s weak lensing survey (Refregier
& the DUNE collaboration 2008; Laureijs et al. 2011) are sum-
marised as (i) a median redshift of 0.9, (ii) a yield of ¯n = 4.7 × 108
galaxies per unit solid angle, (iii) a sky fraction of fsky = 0.5 and
(iv) a Gaussian shape noise with standard deviation σ = 0.3. For
demonstrating the construction of a Lie-basis we will work with
nbin = 2 tomographic bins and collect the signal up to the multipole
(cid:96) = 1000. We work with modes ψ(cid:96)m,i that are statistically indepen-
dent in the wave numbers (cid:96) and m despite incomplete sky coverage
implying that the likelihood would not separate, but instead scale

the logarithmic likelihood with a factor (cid:112) fsky. The tomographic

bins are chosen to contain the same fraction 1/nbin of galaxies.

5 VARIATIONS OF THE FISHER MATRIX

Fisher-matrix forecasts depend on the choice of the ﬁducial model,
because (i) the model determines the signal strength relative to the
noise and therefore the extent of the posterior likelihood and be-
cause (ii) nonlinearities of the model are in general diﬀerent at
diﬀerent points in parameter space, leading to varying degenera-
cies. In fact, it is apparent from the deﬁnition of the Fisher-matrix
eqn. (16) that the true physical parameters are replaced by eﬀec-
tive linear parameters, which in cosmology eﬀectively applies to
every parameter except σ2
8 for linear structures: For σ8, the deriva-
tive ∂Cψ,i j((cid:96))/∂σ2
= const in the regime of linear structure forma-
8
tion. Consequently, the Fisher-matrix is in general varying across

Fisher-matrix across parameter space

parameter space, leading to changes in size and orientation of the
posterior likelihood.

Another numerical eﬀect of model nonlinearities are some-
times surprising dependencies of the Fisher matrix on the size of the
parameter variation used in estimating the derivatives by ﬁnite dif-
ferencing. This eﬀect is completely absent in the case of linear pa-
rameters. Tomographic measurements with a high signiﬁcance such
as Euclid’s weak lensing survey restrict the posterior distribution to
a small region of parameter space in which a linear approxima-
tion of the model is applicable and where the posterior distribution
therefore assumes a Gaussian shape. This has been established by
comparison of Fisher-forecasts with MCMC-sampled likelihoods
for the case of tomographic weak lensing measurements and cos-
mological models with the complexity of wCDM. Only weaker sig-
nals, or equivalently, models with more parameters force the like-
lihood outside the linear regime of the model, making the poste-
rior distribution necessarily non-Gaussian. Therefore, we restrict
ourselves to Gaussian posterior distributions in investigating the
dependence of signal strength and parameter degeneracy on the
choice of the ﬁducial model. A tool for dealing with non-Gaussian
likelihoods on an analytical basis without resorting to MCMC is
DALI (Sellentin et al. 2014; Sellentin & Schäfer 2015), which uses
a higher-order expansion of the logarithmic likelihood.

5.1 Construction of a Lie-basis

(18)

We intend to formulate a basis for describing variations of Fisher
matrices due to varying signal strength and model nonlinearities.
This basis should relate Fisher-matrices throughout the parame-
ter space to each other: Speciﬁcally, Fisher matrices Fµν(x(cid:48)
α) and
Fρσ(xα) at two diﬀerent ﬁducial models are related by a linear trans-
form Uµρ,
Fµν(x(cid:48)
where the transformation Uµρ will depend on the distance between
the two points xα and x(cid:48)
α in parameter space. Eﬀectively, this means
that the transformations Uµρ are continuously parameterised by the
distance x(cid:48)

α − xα and form therefore a Lie-group.

α) = UµρFρσ(xα)Uσν,

µρ(B−1)ρν,

= UµρBρσ → Uµν = B(cid:48)

The transformation can be constructed from a given pair of
Fisher matrices by drawing the matrix root, Fρσ(xα) = BρτBτσ and
Fµν(x(cid:48)
α) = B(cid:48)
σν of each of the matrices and by identifying two
identical pairs of terms of the type
B(cid:48)
from which the matrix Uµν can be isolated. If x(cid:48)
α approaches xα, the
transformation will be to the unit matrix δµν, so for small distances
a linear approximation must apply,
Uµν (cid:39) δµν + (x(cid:48)
which contains the generator Tµν,α of the transformation into the
direction xα. It can be derived by diﬀerentiation,

α − xα)Tµν,α,

(21)

Inversely, the transformation Uµν can be constructed from the gen-
erator Tµν,α through the matrix exponential series as a sum of in-
ﬁnitesimal transformations,

α) = UµρFρσ(xα)Uρν with Uµν (cid:39) δµν + (x(cid:48)

two terms of the matrix exponential. In this case, the approximated
Fisher-matrix Aµν(x(cid:48)
α − x(cid:48))Tµν,α, (23)
Aµν(x(cid:48)
which eﬀectively amounts to a linear extrapolation of the Fisher-
matrix variation from the ﬁducial model at xα to the new model x(cid:48)
α.
In fact, assembling the transformation Uµν from the generators Tµν,α
yields an abelian group of transformations either in the case of lin-
ear extrapolations or if the generators describe only size changes,
or if there is only a single rotation or shearing distortion involved.
This is a necessary condition because of the uniqueness of the trans-
formation irrespective of the order of summation in the parameter
space directions α.

,

Numerically, we derive Tµν,α by ﬁnite diﬀerencing from the
transformation Uµν, which in turn has been derived from Fisher-
(cid:16)
(cid:17)
matrices at two neighbouring points xα ± ∆xα,
Tµν,α (cid:39) 1
Uµν(xα + ∆xα) − Uµν(xα − ∆xα)
2∆xα
with a typical variation ∆α amounting to a few percent of the ﬁdu-
cial value of xα. The linear approximation is suﬃcient given the
slow variation of Fµν, as will be shown by Figs. 1, 2 and 3.

(24)

An alternative description of Fisher-matrix variations is due to
Casas et al. (2015), who perform a Taylor-expansion of the Gaus-
sian likelihood, Fµν(xα + ∆xα) (cid:39) ∂αFµν(xα) ∆xα to ﬁrst order, and
ﬁnd that it captures variations well, commensurate with our expe-
rience that variations across parameter space are weak. In order
to carry out marginalisations we think that our method might be
slightly simpler, as a sum of matrices is not straightforward to in-
vert, although approximations exist if the term ∂αFµν ∆xα is small.
Conditionalisations are, in contrast, straightforward in both
formalisms but for combining diﬀerent Gaussian likelihoods or pri-
ors, the direct Taylor-expansion is better suited, due to the additiv-
ity of the Fisher-matrix for independent likelihoods: In this case,
there is no direct way, due to the matrix root in constructing the
transformation, to combine generators. Instead one needs to com-
pute Fisher-matrices for each likelihood separately and add them in
a second step. The respective advantages and disadvantages origi-
nate from describing the variation of the Fisher-matrix with a mul-
tiplication in our case or by an addition in the case of Casas et al.
(2015).

If one chooses a reparameterisation yβ(xα), for instance by ap-
plying a principal component analysis which in the Gaussian case
decouples otherwise correlated parameters, it is straightforward to
show that the generators transform according to the rule
Tµν,α → JµρJνσJ−1
(25)
with the Jacobian matrices relating the old parameterisation xα to a
new one yβ through Jαβ = ∂xα/∂yβ. In this way, the transformation
Uµν changes, when generated from Tµν,α, in analogy to the Fisher-
matrix Fµν, Fµν → JµαJνβFαβ, which itself is a tensor.

of the Fisher matrix, ω a rotation, and γ+ and γ× jointly shearing. As
in gravitational lensing, we combine the two components of shear

obtained by inversion, an = Uµνσ(n)
σν =

µν + iabcσ(c)
In this way, one can quantify easily speciﬁc changes of the
Fisher-matrix across parameter space. Additionally, computing the
change of the dark energy ﬁgure of merit det(Fµν) with the cos-
mological parameters is simply given by the factor det(UµσUσν).
In fact, only for the case of Uµν consisting of a pure rotation,
Uµν ∝ σ(2)
µν with a rotation angle ω, the transformation will be or-
thogonal and conserve e.g. the dark energy ﬁgure of merit as the
determinant det(UµσUσµ) is equal to unity.

µµ = 2.

Alternatively, it would be equally possible to decompose the
generators Tµν,α for each direction α. There, similar arguments ap-
ply to commutativity and orthogonality, in particular in the linear
approximation eqn. (20) and the full expression eqn. (22): Commu-
tativity of σ(n)
µν implies commutativity of the corresponding trans-
formations Uµν, but naturally, only the unit matrix commutes with
the other matrices of the Pauli-basis, for which there is the relation
[σ(i), σ( j)] = 2i jkσ(k). Commutativity of the transformations Uµν is
then a consequence of the Baker-Hausdorﬀ-identity,

As an application of the formalism we consider Euclid’s weak lens-
ing forecasts on three sections in parameter space: the (Ωm, σ8)-
plane, the (Ωm, w0)-plane and ﬁnally the (w0, wa)-plane.

The magnitude of the lensing signal is primarily set by the
two cosmological parameters Ωm and σ8, which determine the
strength of the gravitational potential: This well-known fact leads
to a banana-shaped likelihood in the (Ωm, σ8)-plane which has been
observed by e.g. CFHTLenS. Consequently, one would expect a
change in the size in the extent of the posterior distribution between
large products (Ωmσ8)2, which generate strong lensing signals and
therefore small statistical errors and small products (Ωmσ8)2. This
behaviour is recovered by Fig. 1, either directly in the size of the
1σ-ellipses or in the background color gradient, which depicts the
magnitude of the size change through the decomposition of the ma-
trix U, through Uµνσ(0)
νµ . Additionally, there is eﬀectively no change
in the extent of the posterior distribution in models that keep the
product (Ωmσ8)2 constant.

In fact, it is possible to predict the Fisher matrices accurate to better
than 0.005 for variations of Ωm and σ8 of up to 10% of their ﬁdu-
cial values, and this region is aligned with the primary degeneracy
direction along constant (Ωmσ8)2.

Similar results apply to the (Ωm, w0)-plane: There is a smooth
rotation of the Fisher-ellipses with increasing matter density Ωm,
while the size of the ellipses stays essentially constant, as shown
by Fig. 2. The true Fisher-ellipses can be predicted to an accuracy
of 0.005 with the generators in a region in which Ωm varies by about
20% and where w0 varies by 10% around their ﬁducial values, and
this region coincides with that of similar orientation of the ellipses,
indicating that the rotation is in fact the dominant distortion mode.
Physically, larger densities of dark energy, or smaller values of Ωm
lead to an enhanced growth D+/a of the potentials if the growth
function is normalised to one today, D+(1) = 1, likewise a less

negative equation of state parameter w. At the same time, the Hub-
ble function H(a) which converts the redshift distribution p(z)dz
into a distribution of comoving distance, assumes the smallest val-
ues for both small Ωm and more negative w, if its value today is
ﬁxed, H(1) = H0. Additionally, the lensing signal is sensitive to
Ωm through the shape parameter Γ (cid:39) Ωmh, which changes the am-
plitude of the CDM-spectrum P(k), which has a minor eﬀect on the
lensing spectrum.

Products of strong growth and small Hubble functions should
cause degeneracies in the lensing signal, i.e. combinations of small
Ωm and less negative w for growth and small Ωm with more neg-
ative w for the Hubble functions, leading to almost independent
measurements. The line of equal Hubble functions and the line of
equal growth rates would run through the parameter plane diago-
nally. The lensing signal constrains Ωm tighter than w, due to the
fact that weak cosmic shear strength is proportional to Ωm but mea-
sures w only through an integral over the scale factor a.

Lastly, the (w0, wa)-plane shows large degeneracy between the
two dark energy parameters which is due to the fact that the equa-
tion of state function w(a) enters lensing observables through an
integral over scale factor a, and through the integration process in

the rotation of the Fisher-ellipses relative to the ﬁducial model, and the black contour indicates the zone where the Lie-approximation deviates from the exact
Fisher-matrix by less than 0.005. The ellipses assume a sky coverage of fsky = 0.25. The black dashed lines marks cosmologies with equal Hubble-parameters

solving the growth equation, before one carries out the line of sight
integration as the third integral. Therefore, weak lensing alone is
only sensitive to an eﬀective equation of state, causing large de-
generacies between w0 and wa, which can only partially be broken
by lensing tomography, as depicted by Fig. 3. Apart from being
interesting in its own right, we investigated Fisher-ellipses in that
particular plane in parameter space to show that the formalism is
able to deal with strongly elongated ellipses. In fact, one observes
a shearing (along with a rotation) in the Fisher-ellipses when vary-
ing the two dark energy parameters, and a wide region in which
the ellipses can be predicted accurately which is aligned with the
direction of constant eﬀective equations of state and therefore with
the primary degeneracy direction of the Fisher-ellipses.

The dark energy ﬁgure of merit is the inverse determinant of
Fw0wa, and application of our formalism shows that there is a de-
pendence of the ﬁgure of merit across the w0-wa-plane as models
with very negative eﬀective equations of state can be better con-
strained than those with less negative ones. This can be conﬁrmed
in two ways, either by computing the trace Uµµ = Uµσσ(0)
µν or the
determinant det(UµσUσµ). Both are indicators of the change in area
of the ellipse in the w0-wa-plane, which we found to be slowly vary-

ing across this parameter space section, with typical variations be-
tween −26% and +30% relative to the area at the ﬁducial ΛCDM-
cosmology. Again, variations of the Fisher-matrix can be reliably
described with our formalism: Within a 10%-variation in w0 (which
roughly corresponds to the current uncertainty on this parameter,
Planck Collaboration: Ade, P. A. R. et al. 2015) the relative extrap-
olation error amounts to 0.005.

In summary it is very good that there are only comparatively
small variations of the forecasts across parameter space, both in
size, ellipticity and orientation of the Fisher-ellipses, at least for a
wCDM cosmology.

Lastly, we would like to add a few remarks on the treatment of
systematical errors in our formalism, as future surveys will be very
likely dominated by systematics instead of statistics. Formalisms
for predicting biases in the estimation of cosmological parameters
have been developed in a number of diﬀerent applications (in the
context of CMB-science, Cabré et al. 2007; Taburet et al. 2009),
and generalised to the case of non-vanishing covariances between
data points (Amara & Réfrégier 2008; Schäfer & Heisenberg 2012).
In this formalism, the bias δµ results from solving a linear system

contour it is possible to predict the Fisher ellipses with an accuracy better than 0.005. The ellipses have been scaled down with a factor of 0.1 due to the strong

from the signal, its noise and the systematic in question. Both quan-
tities change across parameter space, and one can derive transfor-
mations for Gµν and aν separately, which can be used to compute
the variation of δµ, and in this way any complication arising from
ﬁnding a basis for G−1
µν is avoided. Speciﬁcally, the basis for Gµν
is constructed in complete analogy to that of Fµν, whereas only a
single transformation matrix is needed for the vector aµ.

Finally we would like to point out that generators Tµν,α can
be used to predict Fisher-matrices and derived quantities such as
the dark energy ﬁgure of merit with the parameters characterising
survey design (Kirk et al. 2011), in order to carry out optimisa-
tions: In this case, Tµν,α would describe the rate of change of the
Fisher-matrix with a survey parameter such as redshift depth or
shape noise amplitudes.

6 SUMMARY

Subject of this paper was the investigation of the model parameter
dependence of statistical forecasts made with the Fisher-formalism,
speciﬁcally tomographic weak lensing forecasts for Euclid, and a
description of this parameter dependence with a speciﬁcally con-

structed basis. In general, we found that in the three sections
through a wCDM-parameter space there was a weak variation of
the Fisher-constraints with the choice of the ﬁducial cosmology,
in particular the dark energy ﬁgure of merit is almost independent
from the ﬁducial.

(i) From the Fisher-matrix at some position in parameter space
and the Fisher-matrix at the reference cosmology we derived a lin-
ear transformation that relates the two. Expanding the transforma-
tion matrix in terms of Pauli-matrices leads to a straightforward
interpretation of the variations of the Fisher-matrices in terms of
changes in size, rotation and shearing.

(ii) We constructed a basis from the transformation matrix be-
tween the Fisher-matrices at the ﬁducial cosmology and an in-
ﬁnitesimally displaced model. Transformations for ﬁnite displace-
ments are derived by linear extrapolation. Comparing the extrapo-
lated Fisher-matrix with the true one shows an accurate prediction
for a large region in parameter space, which coincides as expected
with the main degeneracy directions.

(iii) Speciﬁcally, the (Ωm, σ8)-plane is known for having strong
degeneracies in gravitational
lensing, ultimately a hyperbolic
banana-shaped conﬁdence contour for weaker signals. There, the

variation of the Fisher-ellipse was predicted to percent accuracy
for variations of 10% in Ωm and σ8. At the same time, the main
change is simply a scaling in size of the Fisher-matrix, reﬂecting
the proportionality of the lensing signal to the product ∝ (Ωmσ8)2.
Likelihood ellipses in the (Ωm, w0)-plane show a rotation with Ωm,
while staying roughly constant in size, and while showing a simi-
larly large range of accurate extrapolations. In all cases, directions
of weak changes in parameter space can be understood as weak de-
pendences of the weak lensing model on parameters, such as lines
of constant (Ωmσ8)2 or constant average dark energy equation of
state parameters.

(iv) The formalism is capable of dealing with strongly degener-
ate cases such as the (w0, wa)-constraints from weak lensing alone,
which shows a shearing across parameter space: There, the varia-
tion of the dark energy ﬁgure of merit is accurately predicted for
the currently allowed parameter space.

(v) The method is limited by the volume of parameter space
where linear extrapolation is applicable: In general, commutativ-
ity of individual transforms along single parameters is not en-
sured. In one or two dimensions it should be possible to follow
variations of the Fisher-matrix further, but errors will increase on
a scale which can be estimated by the inverse of the generator,
α − xα
(vi) We considered variations of Gaussian likelihoods, which
are completely described by positive deﬁnite covariance matrices.
Generalising this method to non-Gaussian likelihoods should be
possible by considering the transformation of each term of an ex-
pansion of the logarithmic likelihood in polynomials, as in the
DALI-formalism: This will be a set of generators Tµνρ,α and Tµνρσ,α
for the fourth order expansion, with n2(n + 1)/2 and n2(n + 1)2/4
values for n parameters, respectively.

Future developments include an extension of this formalism
to estimation biases, which depend through both the Fisher-matrix
and the dependency of any systematic on the set of cosmological
parameters. The formalism above should be able to describe vari-
ations of a multivariate Gaussian in the the proposal distribution
of an MCMC-engine, which could potentially speed up MCMC-
sampling by reorienting and resizing the proposal distribution. As
a third application, we envision studies of combining probes with
large intrinsic degeneracies to ﬁt cosmological data, as shown by
Lesgourgues et al. (2015) for signs for interacting dark matter based
on CMB-data, or for studies on degeneracy breaking (Howlett et al.
2012; Amara & Refregier 2014).

The formalism is as well suited for describing variations
of covariances of power spectrum estimates, which become non-
diagonal in nonlinear structure formation, and is capable of interpo-
lating between estimates of the covariance from simulations (Blot
et al. 2015), or estimates of the data covariance matrix, which is
needed for the precision determination of cosmological parameters
(Kayo et al. 2013; Taylor et al. 2013; Taylor & Joachimi 2014). We
intend to investigate these questions further, as well as the applica-
tion to systematical errors.
