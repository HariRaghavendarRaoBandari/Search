ABSTRACT

We report the discovery of two hot Jupiters using photometry from Campaigns 4 and 5 of the two-
wheeled Kepler (K2) mission. EPIC210957318b has a mass of 0.65 ± 0.14MJ , a radius of 1.070 ±
0.018RJ and transits its G dwarf (Teﬀ = 5675 ± 50 K), slightly metal rich ([Fe/H]= +0.06 ± 0.04
dex) host star in a 4.1 days circular orbit. EPIC212110888b has a mass of 1.63 ± 0.12MJ , a radius of
1.38± 0.014RJ and has an orbital period of 3.0 days in which it orbits a late F dwarf (Teﬀ = 6149± 55
K) solar metallicity star. Both planets were validated probabilistically and conﬁrmed via precision
radial velocity (RV) measurements. They have physical and orbital properties similar to the ones of
the already uncovered population of hot Jupiters and are well-suited candidates for further orbital
and atmospheric characterization via detailed follow-up observations.

INTRODUCTION

Extrasolar planets with structural properties similar
to Jupiter, orbiting at close separations from their host
stars (a < 0.05 AU, P < 8 days) are known as hot
Jupiters. Nowadays, ∼250 transiting hot Jupiters have
been discovered, mostly thanks to the existence of ded-
icated ground-based photometric surveys like HATNet
(Bakos et al., 2004), SuperWasp (Pollacco et al., 2006)
and HATSouth (Bakos et al., 2013). The brightness of
the host stars of the majority of these transiting planets,
coupled with the relatively strong observational signa-
tures (e.g. transit depth, radial velocity semi-amplitude)
have allowed the determination of both, the radii and the
masses of most of the discovered transiting hot Jupiters,
which has been used to directly compute their bulk den-
sities. Moreover, by comparing this information with
theoretical models (e.g. Fortney et al., 2007; Burrows et
al., 2007), the inner structure and composition of these
planets can be inferred.
In addition to the estimation
of the physical parameters, if the hosts stars are bright
enough, the execution of detailed photometric and spec-
troscopic follow-up observations on these systems permit
to characterize their atmospheric structure and compo-
sition via transmission spectroscopy and/or secondary
eclipses (see, e.g., Seager & Deming, 2010; Crossﬁeld,
2015); to reﬁne the geometry of the orbit via the mea-
surement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect (McLaugh-
lin, 1924; Rossiter, 1924); and to discover additional
planetary companions by performing long term RV mon-
itoring (e.g. Neveu-VanMalle et al., 2016), TTV analysis

Even though hot Jupiters are arguably the most char-
acterized type of extrasolar planet, there are several the-
oretical problems about their existence that remain to
be solved. For example, there is no consensus about
how these massive planets reached their current short
orbital semi-major axes.
In situ formation has proven
to be unlikely (Raﬁkov, 2006), but the current observa-
tional evidence is not able to discriminate between gen-
tle migration by gravitational interactions with the pro-
toplanetary disk (Lin et al., 1996) and high eccentric-
ity migration mechanisms(Rasio & Ford, 1996). On the
other hand, the mass and radius determination of tran-
siting hot Jupiters have revealed a wide diversity regard-
ing their internal structure. In particular, an important
fraction of these systems present radii that are too large
to be explained with current theoretical models of plane-
tary structure (e.g. Anderson et al., 2010; Hartman et al.,
2011). The inﬂated radii of these planets has been shown
to be correlated with the degree of insolation from their
parent stars (Guilliot, 2005), but the main responsible
mechanism is still unknown.

The detection of more hot Jupiters, particularly those
transiting bright stars, can be used to test theories about
their structure and evolution. We report the discovery
of two new systems by using data from the two-wheeled
Kepler K2 mission. Unlike the original Kepler mission,
K2 is currently observing ﬁelds that are located close the
ecliptic plane, and ground-based facilities located in the
southern hemisphere can be used to conﬁrm the plane-
tary nature of potential candidates. In this context, we
are conducting a Chilean based RV follow-up project of
K2 candidates which has already discovered a Neptune-
sized planet with a period of ≈ 42 d (Espinoza et al.,
2016). The two hot Jupiters presented is this paper were
independently discovered by other teams using facilities
from the northern hemisphere (Lillo-Box et al., 2016;
Johnson et al., 2016; Hirano et al., 2016).

The paper is structured as follows. In §2 we present
the data, which includes the K2 photometry and the high

2

Brahm et al. 2016

resolution spectra and radial velocities obtained with the
HARPS, FEROS and CORALIE spectrographs. §3 de-
scribes the joint analysis that was applied to the data and
presents the derived parameters of the planetary systems.
Finally, in §4 we discuss our ﬁndings.

2. DATA

2.1. K2 Photometry

We analysed the photometric data of K2’s campaigns
4 and 5. In particular, we obtained all the decorrelated
light curves from Vanderburg & Johnson (2014), using
the photometry with the optimal aperture. The method
that we used to select the transiting planetary candi-
dates is described in detail in Espinoza et al. (2016).
After performing a Box Least Squares (BLS, Kov´acs,
Zucker & Mazeh, 2002) algorithm, we found that the
stars EPIC210957318 and EPIC212110888 showed sig-
niﬁcant periodic signals at 4.1 and 3.0 days, respectively.
Both of these systems were selected as strong Jovian
planetary candidates based on their transit properties
(depths, shapes and durations), and due to the lack of ev-
ident out of transit variations. Following Espinoza et al.
(2016), both decorrelated light curves were normalised by
applying a median ﬁlter with a 21 point (∼ 10.25 hour)
window, which was then smoothed using a Gaussian ﬁl-
ter with a 5-point standard-deviation. These normalised
light curves were then used by our transit-ﬁtting pipeline,
which results are shown in Section 3.2 (see Figures 1 and
2).

2.2. Spectroscopic follow-up observations

Once both targets were identiﬁed as strong transit-
ing hot Jupiter candidates, we proceeded to acquire high
resolution spectra with three diﬀerent stabilised instru-
ments with the goal of measuring the RV variation of the
stellar hosts produced by the gravitational pull of the
planetary companions.
In the case of EPIC210957318
we obtained 4 spectra using the HARPS spectrograph
(Mayor et al., 2003) mounted on the ESO 3.6m telescope
at La Silla Observatory and 5 spectra using the FEROS
spectrograph (Kaufer & Pasquini, 1998) mounted on the
MPG 2.2m telescope located in the same observatory.
For EPIC212110888 we obtained 7 spectra with FEROS
and 3 spectra using the CORALIE spectrograph (Queloz
et al., 2001) mounted on the 1.2m Euler Telescope in La
Silla Observatory.

The FEROS and CORALIE data were obtained us-
ing the simultaneous calibration method (Baranne et al.,
1996), in which we acquire a spectrum of a ThAr lamp
with the comparison ﬁbre while the spectrum of the sci-
ence star is acquired with the principal ﬁbre. We use
the ThAr spectra to trace the instrumental instrumental
velocity drifts produced by environmental changes inside
the spectrograph. On the other hand, since the HARPS
nightly drift is typically <1 m s−1, the observations with
this instrument were performed with the comparison ﬁ-
bre pointing to the background sky in order to avoid
contamination from saturated ThAr lines.

The data from these three instruments were processed
through dedicated pipelines built from a modular code
that was designed to develop completely robust and au-
tomated pipelines for reducing, extracting and analysing
echelle spectra of diﬀerent instruments in a optimal and

homogeneous way (CERES, Brahm et al.
in prep). A
detailed description of the pipeline developed for the
CORALIE spectrograph is available in Jord´an et al.
(2014). Brieﬂy, the pipelines identify the echelle or-
ders using the ﬂat frames, and after correcting by the
bias level and the scattered light, the orders of the sci-
ence and wavelength calibration images are optimally
extracted following Marsh (1989). The reference global
wavelength calibration solution is computed from the cal-
ibration ThAr image acquired in the afternoon by ﬁtting
a chebyshev polynomial as a function of the pixel position
and echelle order number. If required, the instrumental
drifts during the night are computed using the extracted
ﬂux of the comparison ﬁbre, which is illuminated either
by a ThAr lamp or by a Fabry-Perot etalon. The ex-
tracted ﬂat frames are used to perform the correction
by the blaze function, and then, a low order polynomial
is ﬁtted to each order, with an iterative algorithm that
avoids the inclusion of absorption lines in the ﬁt, in or-
der to construct a continuum normalised spectrum. The
barycentric correction is performed using the JPLephem
package, and RVs and bisector spans (BSs) are deter-
mined by computing the cross-correlation function be-
tween the continuum normalised spectrum and a binary
mask that resembles the spectrum of a G2 type star.

Table 1 lists the resulting RV variations and BSs
computed for both systems. Figures 3 and 4 show
the phase-folded RVs and BSs for EPIC210957318 and
EPIC212110888, respectively.
It can be seen that the
two RV curves are consitent with giant planets in short
period orbits. Moreover, there is no apparent correlation
between the RVs and the BSs. (see the bottom panels of
Figures 3 and 4).

3. ANALYSIS

3.1. Stellar properties

In order to obtain the properties of the host stars, we
made use of the available photometric and spectroscopic
observables for both targets. We retrieved B,V ,g,r and
i photometric magnitudes from the AAVSO Photomet-
ric All-Sky Survey (APASS, Henden & Munari, 2014)
and J, H and K photometric magnitudes from 2MASS
for our analysis. For the spectroscopic data, we used
the Zonal Atmospherical Stellar Parameter Estimator
(ZASPE, Brahm et al., 2015, 2016) algorithm with our
FEROS spectra as input. ZASPE estimates the atmo-
spheric stellar parameters and v sin i from our high reso-
lution echelle spectra via a least squares method against
a grid of synthetic spectra in the most sensitive zones
of the spectra to changes in the atmospheric parameters.
ZASPE obtains reliable errors in the parameters, as well as
the correlations between them by assuming that the prin-
cipal source of error is the systematic mismatch between
the data and the optimal synthetic spectra, which arises
from the imperfect modelling of the stellar atmosphere or
from poorly determined parameters of the atomic transi-
tions. We used a synthetic grid provided by Brahm et al.
(2016) and the spectral region considered for the analysis
was from 5000 to 6000 ˚A, which includes a large number
of atomic transitions and the pressure sensitive Mg Ib
lines.

The resulting atmospheric parameters obtained by
ZASPE were Teﬀ = 5575 ± 50 K, log(g) = 4.60 ± 0.05,

We used the isochrones package (Morton, 2012) and
the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database (Dotter et
al., 2008) to obtain the physical properties of both
stars (mass, radius and age) from the derived atmo-
spheric parameters and the available photometric mag-
nitudes. We took into account the uncertainties in
the photometric and spectroscopic properties to esti-
mate the physical properties of the stars, using the
MultiNest algorithm (Feroz & Hobson, 2008), which
allow us to eﬃciently explore the posterior parameter
space. For EPIC210957318 we obtained a radius of
R∗ = 0.841+0.013
−0.014M(cid:12), an
age of 1.77+1.07−0.49 Gyr, and a distance to the host star of

3.2. Joint analysis

We performed a joint analysis of the detrended and
normalised K2 photometry and the radial velocities using
the EXOplanet traNsits and rAdIal veLocity ﬁttER,
exonailer, which is made publicly available at Github6
and its structure and funcionalities are described in Es-
pinoza et al. (2016). Given the short tidal circularisation
timescales expected for both systems due to their short
orbital periods, we ﬁxed the eccentricity to e = 0. The
joint model ﬁts for the instrumental velocity oﬀsets be-
tween diﬀerent echelle spectrographs and also ﬁts for the
jitter of each instrument. For the radial velocities, unin-
formative priors were set on the semi-amplitude, K, and
the RV zero point, µ. The former was centered on zero,
while the latter was centered on the observed mean of
the RV dataset. For the lightcurve modelling, we used
the selective resampling technique described in Kipping
(2010) in order to account for the 30 min cadence of the
K2 photometry, which produces a smearing of the transit
shape. In order to minimize the biases in the retrieved
transit parameters we ﬁt for the limb darkening coeﬃ-
cients in our analysis (see Espinoza & Jord´an, 2015). We
parametrized the limb-darkening eﬀect using the square
root law, because for the properties of our two systems,
it provides the minimum mean square error, following
the method described in Espinoza & Jord´an (2016). We
used a white-noise model to treat the photometric residu-
als, because we tried ﬁrst to ﬁt a ﬂicker-noise model, but
the parameters obtained with this model were consistent
with no 1/f noise component. 500 walkers were used to
evolve the MCMC, and each one explored the parameter
space in 2000 links, 1500 of which were used as burn-in
samples. This gave a total of 500 links sampled from
the posterior per walker, giving a total of 250000 sam-
ples from the posterior distribution. These samples were
tested to converge both visually and using the Geweke
(1992) convergence test.

The best ﬁt models to the light curves are plot-

to the RV curve are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respec-
tively. The resulting parameters of our ﬁt are tabulated

consistent with being hot Jupiters. For EPIC210957318b

RP = 1.07 ± 0.018RJ and an equilibrium temperature
of Teq = 1212 ± 18K, assuming zero albedo. On the
other hand, for EPIC212110888b we obtain Mp = 1.63±
0.12MJ , RP = 1.38 ± 0.14RJ and Teq = 1704 ± 18K,
where the large uncertainty in the radius is dominated
by the large uncertainty in the radius of the host star.

3.3. Planet scenario validation and transit dilutions

We performed a blend analysis for both systems by us-
ing the vespa package (Morton, 2012), which allowed
us to compute the false-positive probability (FPP) of
the transits being produced by diﬀerent conﬁgurations
of diluted eclipsing binaries. By assuming an occur-
rence rate of 1% for hot Jupiter-like planets (Wang et
al., 2015), and using only the K2 light-curves extracted
with the optimal aperture according to Vanderburg &
Johnson (2014), which corresponds to 3 pixels (12(cid:48)(cid:48)) for
EPIC210957318 and 4 pixels (16(cid:48)(cid:48)) for EPIC212110888,

we obtain a FFP of 0.18% and 21% for EPIC210957318b
and EPIC212110888b, respectively. Given that the FPP
of EPIC210957318b is smaller than the accepted 1%
threshold (e.g., Montet et al., 2015), it can be validated
by the photometry alone. On the other hand, for validat-
ing EPIC212110888b we can further use the information
obtained by our spectroscopic data. Given that we do not
observe any evident secondary peaks in the CCF, strong
BS variations or correlations between the RV and BS
measurements, we can set the likelihood of all eclipsing
binary scenarios to 0, excluding line-of-sight blends and
hierarchical triples. With these assumptions, the FPP
of EPIC212110888b drops to 0.052%, which validates its
planetary nature.

While we reject that the observed transits are pro-
duced by eclipsing binaries, we cannot rule out that
the observed planetary transits are being diluted by
the presence of another foreground or background star.
For EPIC210957318b, changes in the inferred planetary
radius of the order of the errors can be produced by
sources located inside the aperture which are at least
≈ 3.7 magnitudes fainter than the host star. On the
other hand, for EPIC212110888b, changes in the inferred
planetary radius on the order of the errors can be pro-
duced by sources which are at least ≈ 2.0 magnitudes
fainter than the host star. However, most of these con-
taminant sources can be rejected from the lack of ev-
ident additional stars in the POSS images centred in
EPIC210957318 and EPIC212110888; and also due to
the lack of secondary peaks in the CCF plots.

3.4. Searching for additional signals in the K2

photometry

We searched for additional signals in the photometry
of both targets stars in order to search for additional
transiting companions, secondary eclipses and/or opti-
cal phase variations due to either reﬂected light of the
detected transiting planets, ellipsoidal variations and/or
doppler beaming (e.g. Estevez, De Mooij & Jayaward-
hana, 2013).

The transit search was performed using the Box Least
Squares (BLS) algorithm on the data with the transit
of the detected planetary companion masked. For each
signiﬁcant peak on the BLS periodogram, we visually
inspected the phased lightcurve in order to search for
additional transits. In addition, the lightcurve was also
inspected at periods 2, 3/2, 1/2 and 2/3 times the period
of the detected transiting planet presented in this work
in order to search for additional companions in 2:1 and
3:2 mean-motion resonances.

For both EPIC210957318 and EPIC212110888, no ad-
ditional transiting companions were found, which limit
the possible companions to transit depths smaller than
200 ppm and 90 ppm, respectively, at 3-sigma. Also,
no secondary eclipses and optical phase variations were
detected on either lightcurve. Given the best-ﬁt transit
parameters of EPIC210957318b, the non-detection of a
secondary eclipse was expected, as they would have to be
smaller than (Rp/a)2 ∼ 150 ppm. Optical phase varia-
tions were expected to be below this limit as well. In the
case of EPIC212110888b, (Rp/a)2 ∼ 200 ppm, and our
analysis rules out any secondary eclipse larger than 90
ppm at 3-sigma; this implies that the geometric albedo
of EPIC212110888b is constrained by our data to be less

than 0.45, which is in agreement again with the typi-
cal geometric albedo of hot Jupiters (Heng & Demory,
2013). No optical phase variations were detected either.

4. DISCUSSION

In this paper we present an independent discovery of
two transiting hot Jupiters orbiting main sequence stars,
that were ﬁrst selected as candidates from K2 photome-
try of campaigns 4 and 5. The planetary nature of these
two objects was then conﬁrmed by precision RV measure-
ments using three high resolution echelle spectrographs
located in the southern hemisphere. Both systems were
recently announced by other teams which performed in-
dependent follow-up campaigns using spectroscopic fa-
cilities located in the northern hemisphere (Lillo-Box et
al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Hirano et al., 2016).

The mass of EPIC210957318b is in-between the Sat-
urn and Jupiter mass (Mp = 0.65 ± 0.14MJ ), while its
radius (Rp = 1.070± 0.018RJ ) is slightly larger than the

cantly more massive (Mp = 1.63 ± 0.12MJ ) and larger
Rp = 1.38 ± 0.014RJ ) than Jupiter. However, the physi-
cal and orbital properties of both of these systems resem-
ble quite well the ones of the typical population of known
hot Jupiters, which can be visualised with Figures 5 and
6. In Figure 5, the mass-radius diagram for the complete
population of discovered transiting hot Jupiters (P < 10
days, RP > 0.5RJ ), shows that the physical parameters
of EPIC210957318b and EPIC212110888b lie in densely
populated regions of the parameters space, and that both
planets share a similar density, close to half the one of
Jupiter (ρJ = 0.67 g cm−3). Another particularity to
notice from Figure 5 is that, while the inferred radius
of EPIC210957318b can be explained with the models of
planetary structure of Fortney et al. (2007) by requiring
a core mass of ∼ 15 M⊕, the radius of EPIC212110888b
is signiﬁcantly larger than that predicted by these mod-
els, and suﬀers from the radiative and/or tidal inﬂation
mechanisms that typical hot Jupiters are victims of (see
Spiegel & Burrrows, 2013).

This dichotomy in the structure of both planets can be
explained by the diﬀerent insolation levels to which they
are subjected. Figure 6, shows the radii of the discov-
ered transiting hot Jupiters as function of their equilib-
rium temperatures assuming zero albedo, which shows
the correlation ﬁrst noted by Guilliot (2005). While the
equilibrium temperature of EPIC210957318b (1212 K) is
relatively close to the threshold limit proposed by Kov´acs
et al. (2010) of Teq = 1000 K, below which the inﬂation
of the radius of Jovian planets is not signiﬁcant (see also
Demory & Seager, 2011), the equilibrium temperature of
EPIC212110888b is relatively high (1704 K) and its in-
ferred radius is totally compatible with the correlation.
Finally, the two systems are interesting candidates for
follow-up studies. The low density of EPIC210957318b
combined with the relatively small radius of its host star
implies a scale height of 340 km and a transmission spec-
troscopic signal of 744 ppm (assuming an H2 dominated
atmosphere and a signal of 5 scale-heights), which means
that this system is a good target to be observed via trans-
mission spectroscopy to characterize its atmosphere. In
addition to the large expected signal, this system pos-

sesses a nearby (≈ 1(cid:48)) stellar companion with a similar

brightness, which can be used as a comparison source for

transiting hot Jupiters. EPIC210957318b and EPIC212110888b
are shown as blue and red points, respectively. The light dashed
lines correspond to isodendity curves of 0.67, 1.33 and 3.66 g cm−3,
from left to right. According to this ﬁgure, the two new systems
can be classiﬁed as common hot Jupiters having densities close to
half the one of Jupiter. The dark dashed lines correspond to the
Fortney et al. (2007) models for typical properties of hot Jupiters
(a = 0.045 AU, 3 Gyr,), and central core masses of 100 M⊕ (bottom
curve) and 0 M⊕ (top curve).

perature for the complete population of discovered transiting hot
Jupiters. Both systems follow the known correlation between the
level of insolation and the degree of inﬂation in radii. The radius of
EPIC210957318b can be explained with the Fortney et al. (2007)
models because its equilibrium temperature lies close to the lower
limit of 1000 K (dashed line) below which planets are not expected
to be inﬂated.

long slit transmission spectroscopy. On the other hand,
the v sin(i) value of EPIC212110888 and its moderately
bright nature, make of this system a good target for mea-
suring the Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect in order to deter-
mine the sky-projected obliquity angle. This eﬀect has
indeed been already measured by Hirano et al. (2016),
who found that EPIC212110888b probably lies in a pro-
grade orbit with low obliquity.
