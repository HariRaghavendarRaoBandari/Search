Normal subgroups of invertibles and of

unitaries in a C∗-algebra

Leonel Robert

We investigate the normal subgroups of the groups of invertibles and unitaries
in the connected component of the identity. By relating normal subgroups to
closed two-sided ideals we obtain a “sandwich condition” describing all the closed
normal subgroups both in the invertible and in the the unitary case. We use this
to prove a conjecture by Elliott and Rørdam: in a simple C∗-algebra, the group of
approximately inner automorphisms induced by unitaries in the connected com-
ponent of the identity is topologically simple. Turning to non-closed subgroups,
we show, among other things, that in simple unital C∗-algebra the commutator
subgroup of the group of invertibles in the connected component of the identity
is a simple group modulo its center. A similar result holds for unitaries under a
mild extra assumption.

1 Introduction

We investigate below the normal subgroups of the group of invertibles and of the group of
unitaries of a C∗-algebra. We conﬁne ourselves to the connected component of the identity.
Let GA denote the group of invertibles connected to the identity and UA the unitaries
connected to the identity, A being the ambient C∗-algebra. The problem of calculating the
normal subgroups of GA and UA goes to back to Kadison’s papers [Kad52, Kad55, Kad54],
where the (norm) closed normal subgroups of GA and UA, for A a von Neumann algebra
factor, were fully described. Over the years various authors have returned to this problem,
focusing on the case that A is a simple C∗-algebra, and assuming further structural properties
on A. To wit, the factor case is thoroughly discussed in [dlH82]; in [dlHS85] de la Harpe
and Skandalis describe the normal subgroups of GA and UA for A simple, unital and AF; in
[Tho93] Thomsen extends their results to certain simple AH C*-algebras; in [ER93] Elliott
and Rørdam describe the closed normal subgroups of UA for A simple, of real rank zero,
stable rank one, and with strict comparison of projections; in [NR13] Ng and Ruiz do the
same for A simple, unital, exact, and Z-stable. The methods used in these works rely heavily
on the matrix or matrix-like structure of the algebras under study. This permits the use of
special similarities such as transvections and involutions (modeled after the classical case of
linear groups). In this paper we use a diﬀerent approach to the problem: we rely on the
theory of Lie ideals of C∗-algebras and on the properties of the exponential map. This yields
results of greater generality. Notably, we avoid assuming any kind of matrix-like structure

1

on the C∗-algebra. A direct link between normal subgroups and Lie ideals is given by the
fact that the closure of the linear span of a normal subgroup is a Lie ideal. More useful to us
is that the closure of the linear span of the commutators ha − ah, with h ranging in a normal
subgroup and a in A, is a Lie ideal. The exponential map, on the other hand, plays the crucial
role of bringing the proﬁts of our analysis in the additive setting back into the multiplicative
one. With these methods we obtain a full description of the closed normal subgroups of GA
and UA. By reﬁning our methods we are also able to say something about non-closed normal
subgroups. That this approach could bare fruit in the study of the normal subgroups of the
invertibles of a ring was put forward–quite explicitely–by Herstein in [Her72]. The results of
this paper are conﬁrmation that Herstein’s proposal can be followed through in the context
of C∗-algebras.

Let us introduce some notation. Given x, y ∈ A, let [x, y] = xy −yx and (x, y) = xyx−1y−1
(provided that x and y are invertible). Applied to sets, [X, Y ] stands for the linear span of
[x, y] with x ∈ X and y ∈ Y ; (X, Y ) stands for the subgroup generated by (x, y), with x ∈ X
and y ∈ Y . We prove below the following theorem:

Theorem 1.1. Let H be a closed normal subgroup of GA. Let I denote the closed two-sided
ideal generated by [H, A]. Then (H, GA) = (GI , GA).

The analogous theorem for Lie ideals, on which we rely to prove this theorem, is obtained
by Breˇsar, Kissin and Shulman in [BKS08, Theorem 5.27]. Theorem 1.1 yields a description
of all closed normal subgroups of GA in terms of normal subgroups associated to closed
two-sided ideals of A. To see this, given a closed two-sided ideal I deﬁne

GA,I = {a ∈ GA | (a, GA) ⊆ (GI , GA)}.

(1.1)

This is clearly a normal subgroup of GA. (By Lemma 2.2, GA,I is simply the preimage of
the center of GA/I under the quotient map.) It follows from Theorem 1.1 that for any closed
normal subgroup H of GA there exists a closed two-sided ideal I (namely, the one generated
by [H, A]) such that

(GI , GA) ⊆ H ⊆ GA,I.

Conversely, any subgroup H ⊆ GA lying in between (GI , GA) and GA,I is automatically
normal. This kind of “sandwich condition” describing normal subgroups is well-known in
the study of normal subgroups of general linear groups over rings (where a matrix structure
for the ring is certainly available); see [Bas64],[Vas86].

The analogue of Theorem 1.1 for UA is equally valid (Theorem 3.3) and obtained by the
same methods. We use it to investigate the normal subgroups of the group of approximately
inner automorphisms induced by unitaries in UA. Let us denote this group by VA and endow
it with the topology of pointwise convergence in norm. We again ﬁnd an analog of Theorem
1.1 for VA. Hence, its closed normal subgroups are described by a sandwich condition (this
description is somewhat simpliﬁed by the fact that VA is topologically perfect). It follows
that if A is a simple C∗-algebra then VA is a topologically simple group. This answers a
conjecture by Elliott and Rørdam from [ER93].

The methods used to prove the theorems discussed so far can be adapted to non-closed
normal subgroups. In this case we must rely on results on non-closed Lie ideals. We also
need to look closer at the properties of the exponential map in a small neighbourhood of

2

the identity. More speciﬁcally, we rely on the existence of certain elements linked to the
ﬁrst Kashiwara-Vergne equation, as developed by Rouvi`ere in [Rou14]. Equipped with these
tools we prove the following theorem:

Theorem 1.2. Let A be a unital C∗-algebra. Let H be a subgroup of GA normalized by
(GA, GA). Suppose that [H, A] generates A as a closed two-sided ideal. Then (GA, GA) ⊆ H.
Moreover, in this case there exists [A, A] ⊆ L ⊆ A, additive subgroup, such that

H = {eb1 · · · ebn |

bi ∈ L}.

nXi=1

The assumption that [H, A] generates A as a closed two-sided ideal may be rephrased
as saying that H is non-central in any non-zero quotient of A, or roughly put, that H is
“suﬃciently non-central”.
In the case of a simple unital A, Theorem 1.2 implies that a
subgroup normalized by (GA, GA) is either contained in the center or contains (GA, GA);
in particular, (GA, GA) is simple modulo its center. This is the mutiplicative analogue of a
well-known theorem of Herstein on Lie ideals ([Her69, Theorem 1.12]).

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we investigate the closed normal subgroups
In Section 3 we prove
of GA, proving among other results Theorem 1.1 stated above.
analogous results on UA and VA. In Section 4 we revisit some of our work from [Rob14] on
Lie ideals, in preparation for the next section. In Section 5 we investigate the non-closed
normal subgroups of GA, proving among other results Theorem 1.2 stated above. In Section
6 we do the same for UA. However, in this case the arguments do not run as smoothly; we
need to assume the existence of full orthogonal projections in the algebra. Finally, in the
Appendix we revisit certain manipulations of the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorﬀ formula linked
to the ﬁrst Kashiwara-Vergne equation. We follow closely the exposition of these results in
[Rou14].

2 Closed normal subgroups of invertibles

Let’s start by ﬁxing some notation and recalling some useful facts. Let A be a C∗-algebra.
Let A∼ denote its minimal unitization. Let GL(A) denote the group of invertible elements of
A. For non-unital A, GL(A) is deﬁned as the invertible elements in A∼ of the form 1+x, with
x ∈ A. We regard GL(A) as a topological group under the norm topology of A. Our focus
is on the connected component of the identity of GL(A). This group, sometimes denoted by
GL0(A), will be denoted here by GA.

Let X be a subset of A. We denote by span(X) the linear span of X, by Id(X) the closed
two-sided ideal of A generated by X. Let x, y ∈ A. We denote by [x, y] the commutator
xy − yx and by (x, y) the multiplicative commutator xyx−1y−1 (provided that x and y
are invertible). We extend this notation to sets:
If X, Y ⊆ A then [X, Y ] denotes the
| x ∈ X, y ∈ Y }) and (X, Y ) the subgroup generated by the set
subspace span({[x, y]
{(x, y) | x, ∈ X, y ∈ Y } (provided that X and Y are sets of invertibles). We will make
frequent use of the identity

(xy, a) = x(y, a)x−1 · (x, a),

(2.1)

or rather, of its corollary that (x1x2 · · · xn, a) is contained in any normal subgroup containing
(x1, a), . . . , (xn, a).

3

Let ez denote the exponential of z ∈ A. Recall that {ea | a ∈ A} is a generating set of GA.
We make use below of various well known properties of the exponential map some of which
we now review: For all a, b ∈ A we have

log(eaeb) − (a + b) ∈ [A, A]

(2.2)

for a, b ∈ A such that kak + kbk < log 2
2 . This is a consequence of the convergence of the
Campbell-Baker-Hausdorﬀ formula ([Dyn47]). Yet another consequence of the Campbell-
Baker-Hausdorﬀ formula that we use frequently is Trotter’s formula:

ea+b = lim

n (cid:16)e

Observe that it implies that ea+b belongs to the closed subgroup generated by e

A subspace L ⊆ A is called a Lie ideal if [L, A] ⊆ A. We make use throughout the paper of
various results on Lie ideals of C∗-algebras. We will recall them as needed, but we mention
two here which feature crucially in various arguments. The ﬁrst, [Her70, Theorem 1], says
that if L is a Lie ideal of A and x ∈ A is such that [x, [x, L]] = 0 then [x, L] = 0. This theorem
is valid more generally for semiprime rings without 2-torsion. The second, [Rob14, Lemma
1.6], says that if L is a closed Lie ideal of A such that L ⊆ [A, A] and Id(L) = Id([L, A]) then
L = [Id(L), A]. This is a convenient version of the theorem by Breˇsar, Kissin, and Shulman
[BKS08, Theorem 5.27], relating the Lie ideals of a C∗-algebra to its closed two-sided ideals
(of which Theorem 1.1 from the introduction is the multiplicative analogue).

For each closed two-sided ideal I of A we regard I∼ as a subalgebra of A∼, and, in this
way, GI as a closed normal subgroup of GA. Our ﬁrst goal is to prove Theorem 1.1 from the
introduction. Before, we prove a couple of lemmas.

Lemma 2.1. Let I be a closed two-sided ideal of A. Then the set e[I,A] generates (GI , GA)
as a topological group.

Proof. Let us ﬁrst show that ec ∈ (GI , GA) for all c ∈ [I, A]. Let c ∈ [I, A]. Since GI
spans I∼, [I, A] = [GI , A]. Moreover, from the formula [h, a] = h(ah)h−1 − ah we see
that the elements of [GI , A] are expressible as sums of elements of the form hah−1 − a,
with h ∈ GI and a ∈ A. Thus, c is a ﬁnite sum of such elements. By Trotter’s formula
(2.3), to prove that ec ∈ (GI , GA) we may reduce ourselves to the case that c = hah−1 − a
for some h ∈ GI and a ∈ A. Trotter’s formula again yields that ehah−1−a is the limit of
(hea/nh−1e−a/n)n = (h, ea/n)n ∈ (GI , GA), as desired.

Let us now show that (GI , GA) is contained in the closed subgroup generated by e[I,A].
Call this subgroup H. Observe that H is normal by the invariance of e[I,A] under conjugation
by GA. Let g ∈ GI and a ∈ GA and let us show that (g, a) ∈ H. Writing g as a product of
exponentials in GI and using (2.1) we reduce ourselves to the case that g = eb for some b ∈ I.
We can also assume that b is very small. Let us choose b small enough—depending only on
a, which we regard as ﬁxed—so that c := log((a, eb)) is deﬁned. Since (a, eb) = eaba−1
e−b
is of the form 1 + x with x ∈ I, we have c ∈ I. Moreover, choosing b small enough we can
apply (2.2) and get c − (aba−1 − b) ∈ [A, A]. Thus, c ∈ [A, A] ∩ I. But

[A, A] ∩ I = [I, A],

(2.4)

4

by [Mie81, Lemma 1]. Hence, c ∈ [I, A], and so ec belongs to the closure of e[I,A], as
desired.

Lemma 2.2. Let I be a closed two-sided ideal of A. Let g ∈ GA. If (g, GA) ⊆ I∼ then
(g, GA) ⊆ (GI , GI ).

Proof. Let g ∈ GA be as in the statement of the lemma and let a ∈ GA. To prove that
(g, a) ∈ (GI , GA) it suﬃces to choose a from a generating set of GA (by (2.1)). Let us
pick a = eb, with b small so that c := log((g, eb)) is deﬁned. We thus want to show that
ec ∈ (GI , GA). From

(g, etb) − 1

= gbg−1 − b,

lim
t→0

t

and that the left hand side belongs to I∼, we deduce that gbg−1 − b ∈ I∼. Hence [g, b] ∈ I∼,
which in turn implies that [g, b] ∈ I, for it is well known that a commutator cannot be a
non-zero scalar multiple of the identity. It follows that c ∈ I. Moreover, choosing b small
enough we also have that c ∈ [A, A] by (2.2). So c ∈ [I, A] by (2.4). Hence, ec ∈ (GI , GA)
by Lemma 2.1.

Remark 2.3. The previous lemma shows that the group NI deﬁned in (1.1) (in the intro-
duction) admits a somewhat more concrete description as the preimage by the quotient map
A∼ → A∼/I of the center of GA/I .

Proof of Theorem 1.1. We deduce from the deﬁnition of I that (H, GA) ⊆ I∼ (since H
becomes central after taking the quotient by I). The inclusion (H, A) ⊆ (GI , GA) now
follows from Lemma 2.2.

Let us prove that (GI , GA) ⊆ (H, A). By Lemma 2.1, it suﬃces to show that e[I,A] ⊆

(H, GA). Let

L = span{hah−1 − a | h ∈ H, a ∈ A}.

We claim that L = [I, A]. Before proving this claim, let us use it to complete the proof of the
theorem. Let c ∈ [I, A]. Since c ∈ L, it can be approximated by a sum of elements of the form
hah−1 − a, with h ∈ H and a ∈ A. By Trotter’s formula, to prove that ec ∈ (H, A) we may
reduce ourselves to the case that c = hah−1 − a with h ∈ H and a ∈ A. Applying Trotter’s
formula once more we see that ehah−1−a is the limit of (eh a
n )n ∈ (H, GA).
Thus, ec ∈ (H, A), as desired.

n )n = (h, e

a

n h−1

e− a

Let us prove our claim that L = [I, A]. From the identities hah−1 − a = [h, ah−1] and
[h, a] = h(ah)h−1 − ah we deduce that L = [H, A]. Thus, we must show that [H, A] = [I, A].
Since H is normal, the closed subspace span(H) is invariant under conjugation by elements of
GA. It is thus a Lie ideal of A (see [MM98, Theorem 2.3]). By [BKS08, Theorem 5.27] applied
to this Lie ideal we have that [H, A] = [J, A], where J = Id([span(H), A]) = Id([H, A]) = I.
This proves our claim.

Corollary 2.4 (Cf. [Her55, Theorem 4]). Let A be a simple C∗-algebra. Let H be a closed
normal subgroup of GA. Then either H is contained in the center of GA or (GA, GA) ⊆ H.

Proof. Assume that H is non-central. Then Id([H, A]) 6= 0, and so Id([H, A]) = A by the
simplicity of A. By the previous theorem, (GA, GA) = (H, GA) ⊆ H.

5

For the remainder of this section we explore further properties of the normal subgroups of

GA relying on Theorem 1.1 and the circle of ideas used to prove it.

Let N2 denote the set of square zero elements of A. That is, N2 = {x ∈ A | x2 = 0}. It
is shown in [Rob14, Corollary 2.3] that span(N2) = [A, A]. In Theorem 2.6 below we prove
the multiplicative analogue of this result.

Lemma 2.5. Let x ∈ N2. Then 1 + x = (u, v) for some u, v ∈ (GA, GA).

Proof. Let M = kxk. It suﬃces to prove the result in the universal C∗-algebra generated by
a square zero element of norm at most M . Thus, we may assume that A = M2(C0(0, M ]) and
that x = ( 0 t
0 0 ), where t denotes the identity function on (0, M ]. Note that, since the group
of invertibles of M2(C0(0, M ]∼ is connected, all the invertible elements that we construct
below are in the connected component of the identity.

A group G is called perfect if G = (G, G). If G is a topological group then it is called

topologically perfect if G = (G, G).

Theorem 2.6. The set 1 + N2 generates (GA, GA) as a topological group. The group
(GA, GA) is topologically perfect.

Proof. Let U2 denote the closed subgroup of GA generated by 1 + N2. Since 1 + N2
is invariant under similarities, U2 is normal. Theorem 1.1 applied to U2 gives us that
(U2, GA) = (GI , GA), where I = Id([U2, A]). Theorem 1.1 applied to the group GA gives us
that (GA, GA) = (GJ , GA), where J = Id([GA, A]). Let us show that I = J = Id([A, A]).
The equality [GA, A] = [A, A] is clear since GA spans A∼. Thus, J = Id([A, A]). To see that
I = Id([A, A]) we ﬁrst use the identity

[xy, a] = [x, ya] + [y, ax],

to deduce that [U2, A] = [1 + N2, A] = [N2, A]. Hence, I = Id([N2, A]). But Id([N2, A]) =
Id([A, A]), by [Rob14, Corollary 2.3]. So I = Id([A, A]). Now we have

(GA, GA) = (U2, GA) ⊆ U2.

On the other hand, U2 ⊆ ((GA, GA), (GA, GA)) by Lemma 2.5. This proves the two claims
of the theorem.

6

The inclusion (GA, GA) ⊆ (GA, GA) is often proper (e.g., take A an irrational rotation
C∗-algebra). Thus, (GA, GA) may fail to be perfect in the algebraic sense. We will show in
Section 5 that (GA, GA) is perfect whenever A is unital and without 1-dimensional represen-
tations.

Recall that a subgroup H ⊆ GA is called subnormal if there exists a ﬁnite chain of

subgroups H ⊆ H1 · · · ⊆ Hn = GA, each normal in the next.

Theorem 2.7. The closed subnormal subgroups of GA are normal.

Proof. Let H be closed and subnormal. Taking the closure of all the subgroups in the chain
of subgroups starting at H and ending in GA, we may assume that they are all closed. It
is then clear that it suﬃces to show that if H ⊆ G ⊆ GA are closed subgroups such that H
is normal in G and G is normal in GA then H is normal in GA. We prove this next. Let
I = Id([H, A]). We clearly have that (H, GA) ⊆ I∼, since H is central in the quotient by I.
By Lemma 2.2,

(1) (H, GA) ⊆ (GI , GA).

On the other hand, since G is normal in GA, we have by Theorem 1.1 that (G, GA) =
(GJ , GA), where J = Id([G, A]). Since I ⊆ J, (GI , GA) ⊆ G, and since H is normal in G,

(2) H is invariant under conjugation by (GI , GA).

We will deduce from (1) and (2) that H is normal in GA. By (1), it suﬃces to show that
(GI , GA) ⊆ H. Moreover, since the exponentials eb, with b ∈ [I, A], generate (GI , GA) (by
Lemma 2.1), it suﬃces to show that such exponentials belong to H. Let

L = span{hah−1 − a | h ∈ H, a ∈ [I, A]}.

We claim that L = [I, A]. Before proving this claim, let us explain how to complete the proof
of the theorem. As stated above, we want to show that ec ∈ H for c ∈ [I, A]. Approximating
c by sums of elements of the form hah−1 − a, with h ∈ H and a ∈ [I, A], and applying
Trotter’s formula, we are reduced to showing that ehah−1−a ∈ H for h ∈ H and a ∈ [I, A].
Applying Trotter’s formula once more, we are further reduced to showing that (h, ea) ∈ H
for all h ∈ H and a ∈ [I, A]. This indeed holds, since ea ∈ (GI , GA) and H is invariant under
conjugation by (GI , GA).

Let us now prove that L = [I, A]. We ﬁrst show that L is a Lie ideal of A. Notice that L
is invariant under conjugation by (GI , GA), since both H and [I, A] are. Let a ∈ [I, A] and
l ∈ L. Then eta ∈ (GI , GA) for all t ∈ R. Thus, the elements on the left side of

etale−ta − l

t

lim
t→0

= [a, l]

belong to L for all t ∈ R. It follows that [L, [I, A]] ⊆ L. Let (eλ) be an approximately central
approximate unit for I. Using that L ⊆ I, we deduce that for all l ∈ L and a, b ∈ A

[l, [a, b]] = lim
λ

[leλ, [a, b]] = lim
λ

[l, [aeλ, b]] ∈ L.

Thus, [L, [A, A]] ⊆ L. By [Rob14, Theorem 1.15], L is a Lie ideal of A. It is clear from
the deﬁnition of L that L ⊆ [A, A]. Thus, by [Rob14, Lemma 1.6], in order to prove that

7

commutes with (hah−1 − a)h = [h, a]; i.e., [h, [h, a]] = 0. Since this holds for all a ∈ [ ˜I, ˜A],

L = [I, A] it suﬃces to show that Id(L) = Id([L, A]) = I. Let eA denote the quotient of A
by Id([L, A]). Let eH and eI denote the images of H and I in this quotient. Let h ∈ eH and
a ∈ [eI, eA]. Then hah−1 − a is central in eA and in particular commutes with h. Hence, h
we have [h, [h, [eI , eA]]] = 0. By Herstein’s [Her70, Theorem 1] applied to the Lie ideal [eI, eA],
we have [h, [eI, eA]] = 0. In particular, [h, [h,eI ]] = 0, which implies that [h,eI] = 0 (Herstein’s
theorem again). Since [h, eA] ⊆ eI, we get [h, [h, eA]] = 0, which implies that [h, eA] = 0 for all
h ∈ eH. That is, [H, A] ⊆ Id([L, A]). Hence I = Id([H, A]) ⊆ Id([L, A]). On the other hand,

we clearly have that L ⊆ I from the deﬁnition of L. Thus, Id(L) = Id([L, A]) = I. This
completes the proof of L = [I, A], as claimed.

Corollary 2.8. Let A be simple C∗-algebra. Then (GA, GA) divided by its center is a topo-
logically simple group.

Proof. Let H ⊆ (GA, GA) be a closed normal subgroup of (GA, GA) properly containing the
center of (GA, GA). By Theorem 2.7 H is also normal in GA. Thus, by Corollary 2.4, either
(GA, GA) ⊆ H or H is in the center of GA. But the latter case cannot be because H is not
contained in the center of (GA, GA). Hence, H = (GA, GA).

Theorem 2.9. If H is a closed subgroup of GA normalized by (GA, GA). Then H is normal
in GA.

Proof. Let I = Id([H, A]). As in the proof of Theorem 2.7, we deduce that

(1) (H, GA) ⊆ (GI , GA).

Also, since H is normalized by (GA, GA),

(2) H is invariant under conjugation by (GI , GA).

Now proceeding as in the proof of Theorem 2.7 we deduce from (1) and (2) that H is a
normal subgroup of GA.

3 Closed normal subgroups of unitaries

Let us denote the unitary group of A by U(A). If A is non-unital, the same convention from
the case of invertibles is applied to unitaries: they are chosen in A∼ and of the form 1 + x,
with x ∈ A. Our focus in this section is on the connected component of the identity in U(A),
which we denote by UA. The closed normal subgroups of UA can be handled in much the
same way as those of GA. So here our arguments will be more succinct, mostly pointing out
the necessary adaptations.

Let Asa denote the set of selfadjoint elements of A. Recall that {eih| | h ∈ Asa} is a
generating set of UA. For each closed two-sided ideal I of A we regard I∼ as a subalgebra
of A∼, and, in this way, UI as a (closed, normal) subgroup of UA.

Lemma 3.1. Let I be a closed two-sided ideal of A. Then the set {eic | c ∈ [I, A] ∩ Asa}
generates (UI , UA) as a topological group.

8

Proof. Let us ﬁrst show that eic ∈ (UI , UA) for all c ∈ [I, A] selfadjoint. Let c ∈ [I, A]
be a selfadjoint. Since UI spans I∼ linearly, c ∈ [UI , A]. Moreover, from the formula
[u, a] = u(au)u∗ − au we see that c is a sum of elements of the form uau∗ − a, with u ∈ UI
and a ∈ A. Taking the selfadjoint part of these elements we may assume that a ∈ Asa.
As in the proof of Lemma 2.1, to prove eic ∈ (UI , UA) we apply Trotter’s formula twice;
ﬁrst to reduce to the case that c = uau∗ − a and then to see that ei(uau∗−a) is the limit of
(u, ei a

n )n ∈ (UI , UA), as desired.

Let us now show that (UI , UA) is contained in the closed subgroup generated by the
elements eic with c ∈ [I, A] ∩ Asa. Call this group H. Observe that H is normal in UA by
the invariance of its generating set under conjugation by UA. Let u ∈ UI and v ∈ UA and
let us show that (u, v) ∈ H. Writing u as a product of exponentials in UI and using (2.1)
we reduce ourselves to the case that u = eib for some b ∈ Isa. We can also assume that b is
very small. Let us choose b small enough so that (a, eib) = eic for some c ∈ Asa. As in the
proof of Lemma 2.1, applying (2.2) we ﬁnd that c ∈ [A, A] ∩ I = [I, A]. Writing c as a limit
of elements in [I, A] and taking their selfadjoint parts if necessary we ﬁnd that eic belongs
to the closure of {eid | d ∈ [I, A] ∩ Asa}, as desired.

Lemma 3.2. Let I be a closed two-sided ideal of A. Let u ∈ UA. If (u, UA) ⊆ I∼ then
(u, UA) ⊆ (UI , UA).

Proof. Let v ∈ UA and let us show that (u, v) ∈ (UI , UA). By (2.1) it suﬃces to choose v
from a generating set of UA; we thus assume that v = eib for some b ∈ Asa. The proof now
proceeds exactly as in Lemma 2.2: Choosing b small enough we have that (u, eib) = eic for
some selfadjoint c ∈ [A, A]. Passing to the limit as t → 0 in ((u, eitb) − 1)/t ∈ I∼ we get that
ubu∗ − b ∈ I∼, whence [u, b] ∈ I∼, and further [u, b] ∈ I (since a commutator cannot be a
non-zero scalar). Hence c ∈ I ∩ [A, A] = [I, A] (by (2.4)). Thus, (u, eib) = eic ∈ (UI , UA) by
Lemma 3.1.

Theorem 3.3. Let H be a normal subgroup of UA. Then (H, UA) = (UI , UA), where
I = Id([H, A]).

Proof. From the deﬁnition of I we clearly have that (H, UA) ⊆ I∼. The inclusion (H, UA) ⊆
(UI , UA) now follows from Lemma 3.2. Let us prove that (UI , UA) ⊆ (H, UA). By Lemma
3.1 it suﬃces to show that eic ∈ (H, UA) for all selfadjoint c ∈ [I, A]. Let us deﬁne

L = span({uau∗ − a | u ∈ H, a ∈ A}).

We claim that L = [I, A]. Before proving this, let us complete the proof of the theorem:
Let c ∈ [I, A] be a selfadjoint. Since c is in L it can be approximated by a sum of elements
of the form uau∗ − a, with u ∈ H and a ∈ A. Taking the selfadjoint part of these terms if
necessary, we may further assume that a ∈ Asa. By Trotter’s formula, we reduce ourselves
to the case that c = uau∗ − a, with u ∈ H and a ∈ Asa. But ei(uau∗−a), by Trotter’s formula,
is the limit of (u, eia/n)n ∈ (H, UA). Thus, eic ∈ (H, UA), as desired.

Let us prove the claim that L = [I, A]. First notice that L = [H, A] because of the
formulas uau∗ − a = [u, au∗] and [u, a] = u(au)u∗ − au. To prove that [H, A] = [I, A]
we proceed as in the proof of Theorem 1.1: We ﬁrst notice that span(H) is a Lie ideal
since it is a closed subspace invariant under conjugation by UA (see [MM98, Theorem 2.3]).

9

By [BKS08, Theorem 5.27] applied to span(H) we have that [H, A] = [J, A], where J =
Id([span(H), A]) = Id([H, A]) = I. This proves our claim.

Corollary 3.4. Let A be a simple C∗-algebra. Let H be a closed normal subgroup of UA.
Then either H is contained in the center of UA or (UA, UA) ⊆ H.

Proof. Argue as in the proof of Corollary 2.4 using Theorem 3.3 in place of Theorem 1.1.

Lemma 3.5. Let x ∈ N2 be such that kxk < p π

(UA, UA).

2 . Then ei[x∗,x] = (u, v) for some u, v ∈

Proof. As in the proof of Lemma 2.5, we may assume that A = M2(C0(0, M ]) and that
x = ( 0 t
2 . The lemma now follows
from [dlHS84b, Lemma 5.13].

0 0 ), where t is the identity function on (0, M ] and M <p π

Theorem 3.6. The set {ei[x∗,x] | x ∈ N2} generates (UA, UA) as a topological group. The
group (UA, UA) is topologically perfect.

Proof. Let V2 denote the closed subgroup of UA generated by {ei[x∗,x] | x ∈ N2}. By the
unitary conjugation invariance of its set of generators, V2 is normal. Theorem 3.3 applied to
V2 yields that (V2, UA) = (UI , UA), where I = Id([V2, A]). Let us show that I = Id([A, A]).

implies that [x∗, x] = limt→0(eit[x∗,x] − 1)/t is in the center. By [NR14, Lemma 5.1], the
selfadjoint and skewadjoint parts of a square zero element are both of the form [y∗, y], where

The inclusion I ⊆ Id([A, A]) is obvious from the deﬁnition of I. Let eA denote the quotient
of A by I. Let x ∈ eA be a square zero element. We can lift x to a square zero element
in A. From this we deduce that eit[x∗,x] is in the center of eA for all t ∈ R. This, in turn,
y is a square zero element. Thus, all the square zero elements of eA are in its center. But
a commutative C∗-algebra contains no nonzero nilpotents. Thus, eA has no nonzero square

zero elements, which in turn implies that it is commutative. Hence Id([A, A]) ⊆ I. We have
thus shown that (V2, UA) = (UId([A,A]), UA). On the other hand, Theorem 3.3 applied to UA
implies that (UA, UA) = (UId([A,A]), UA). So

(UA, UA) = (V2, UA) ⊆ V2 ⊆ ((UA, UA), (UA, UA)),

where we have used Lemma 3.5 in the righmost inclusion. These inclusions must be equalities,
which proves the two claims of the theorem.

Theorem 3.7. The closed subnormal subgroups of UA are normal.

Proof. The proof runs along the same lines as the proof of Theorem 2.7, with minor modiﬁca-
tions. As in that proof, our purpose is to show that if H ⊆ G ⊆ UA are closed subgroups such
that H is normal in G and G is normal in UA then H is normal in UA. We set I = Id([H, A])
and observe that (H, UA) ⊆ I∼. By Lemma 3.2, we get that

(1) (H, UA) ⊆ (UI , UA).

Also,

(2) H is invariant under conjugation by (UI , UA),

10

because it is invariant under conjugation by G which contains (UJ , UA) ⊇ (UI , UA) (where
J = Id([G, A])). Next we use (1) and (2) to deduce that H is normal. By (1), it suﬃces
to show that (UI , UA) ⊆ H. To do this, it suﬃces to show that eic ∈ H for all selfadjoint
c ∈ [I, A] (by Lemma 3.1). Let us deﬁne

L = span({uau∗ − a | u ∈ H, a ∈ [I, A]}).

We claim that L = [I, A]. Assume that this claim is true. Let c ∈ [I, A] ∩ Asa. Since c ∈ L,
it is a limit of sums of elements of the form uau∗ − u, with a ∈ [I, A]. Taking the selfadjoint
part of these sums, we can assume a ∈ [I, A] ∩ Asa (since the selfadjoint part of an element in
[I, A] is again in [I, A]). We can now assume that c is equal to one of these sums. Moreover,
by Trotter’s formula applied twice we are reduced to showing that (u, eia) belongs to H, for
all u ∈ H and selfadjoint a ∈ [I, A]. This holds since eia ∈ (UI , UA), by Lemma 3.1, and H
is invariant under (UI , UA).

Finally, let us prove the claim that L = [I, A]. From the invariance of L under conjugation
by eic, with c ∈ [I, A] ∩ Asa we deduce that [L, c] ⊆ L for all c ∈ [I, A] ∩ Asa. But [I, A] ∩ Asa
spans [I, A]. Hence, [L, [I, A]] ⊆ L. We continue arguing as in the last paragraph of the
proof of Theorem 2.7 to conclude that L = [I, A].

Corollary 3.8. Let A be a simple C∗-algebra. Then (UA, UA) divided by its center is a
topologically simple group.

Proof. We can argue as in Corollary 2.8.

Let Aut(A) denote the group of automorphisms of A. We regard it endowed with the
Ad
topology of pointwise convergence in norm. Let u
7−→ Adu denote the map associating to
each unitary u the inner automorphism Adu(a) := uau∗, for all a ∈ A. Let VA denote the
closure of the image of UA under Ad. That is,

VA = {φ ∈ Aut(A) | Aduλ → φ, uλ ∈ UA for all λ}.

For each closed two-sided ideal I of A, let VI denote the closure of the image of UI under
Ad. That is,

VI = {φ ∈ Aut(A) | Aduλ → φ, uλ ∈ UI for all λ}.

Observe that VI is a closed normal subgroup of VA. We stress that the elements of VI are
automorphisms of A rather than I.

Lemma 3.9. Let I be a closed two-sided ideal of A and B ⊆ A a separable C∗-subalgebra.

(i) For each u ∈ UI there exist v1, v2, . . . ∈ (UI , UA) such that [uv∗n, b] → 0 for all b ∈ B.

(ii) The image of (UI , UA) under the map U(A)

Ad
−→ Aut(A) is dense in VI .

Proof. We work with the sequence algebra A∞ =Q∞n=1 A/L∞n=1 A to simplify some calcu-

lations. We regard A as a subalgebra of A∞ via the diagonal embedding a 7→ [(a)∞n=1] (the
brackets denote the equivalence class of a sequence).
Let us ﬁrst assume that u = eic for some c ∈ Isa. Without loss of generality, assume
that B contains c. By [KR14, Lemma 6.4], there exists d = [(dn)∞n=1] ∈ A∞ such that

11

NPN

c − d commutes with B and each dn has the form 1
j=1(wjcw∗j − c) for some unitaries
w1, . . . , wN ∈ UA. Observe from this that dn is selfadjoint and that dn ∈ [I, A] for all n. Set
vn = eidn for n = 1, . . . . These unitaries have the desired property. Indeed, on one hand
eidn ∈ (UI , UA) for all n by Lemma 3.1. Also, working in A∞, we have that eice−id = ei(c−d),
since d commutes with c, and that ei(c−d) commutes with B, since c − d commutes with B.
Thus, eice−id commutes with B, as desired.

Suppose now that u = eic1eic2 · · · eicm, with c1, . . . , cm ∈ Isa. Assume without loss of
generality that B contains c1, . . . , cm. For each ck choose selfadjoints dk = [(dk,n)∞n=1] ∈ A∞
such that ck − dk commutes with B and dk,n ∈ [I, A] for all k = 1, . . . , m and n ∈ N. Set
vn = eid1,n · · · eidm,n for all n ∈ N. These unitaries have the desired property. Indeed, working
in A∞, we have that

(eic1 · · · eicm)(e−idm · · · e−id1) = ei(cm−dm)eic1 · · · eicm−1e−idm−1 · · · e−id1

= ei(cm−dm) · · · ei(c1−d1).

Since ck − dk commutes with B for all k, the right side commutes with B, as desired.

(ii) Since the automorphisms Adu, with u ∈ UI , are dense in VI , it suﬃces to approximate
them by automorphisms Adv with v ∈ (UI , UA). Let u ∈ UI . Let F ⊆ A be a ﬁnite set and
ǫ > 0. By (i), there exists v ∈ (UI , UA) such that k[uv∗, x]k < ǫ for all x ∈ F . It follows that
kAdu(x) − Adu(x)k < ǫ for all x ∈ F , as desired.

The following theorem may be regarded as a description of the closed normal subgroups

of VA in much the same way that Theorems 1.1 and 3.3 are for GA and UA.

Theorem 3.10. Let G be a closed normal subgroup of VA. Then (G, VA) = VI , where
I = Id({φ(x) − x | x ∈ A, φ ∈ G}).

Proof. Let G be as in the statement of the theorem. Let H = {u ∈ UA | Adu ∈ G}.
Then H is a norm closed normal subgroup of UA. By Theorem 3.3, (UJ , UA) ⊆ H, where
J = Id([H, A]). Hence, Adu ∈ G for all u ∈ (UJ , UA). Lemma 3.9 (ii) then implies that
VJ ⊆ G. Now taking commutators with VA we get (VJ , VA) ⊆ (G, VA). Recall now that,
by Theorem 3.6, the group
overline(UJ , UJ ) = (UJ , UA) is topologically perfect. This group is mapped by Ad as
a dense subgroup of VJ (Lemma 3.9 (ii)). So VJ is also topologically perfect. Hence,
VJ = (VJ , VA) ⊆ G.

Let us show that (G, VA) ⊆ VJ . Let φ ∈ G. From (φ, Adu) = Adφ(u)u∗ we deduce that
φ(u)u∗ ∈ H for all u ∈ UA. Since the set {Adu | u ∈ (UA, UA)} is dense in VA it suﬃces
to show that (φ, Adu) ∈ VJ for all u ∈ (UA, UA). As argued before on similar occasions,
by the identity (2.1) we may choose u from a generating set of (UA, UA). So let’s assume
that u = (v, w), with v, w ∈ UA. Let ν = Adv−1 and ω = Adw. We wish to show that
(φ, (ν−1, ω)) ∈ VJ . By the Hall-Witt identity,

(φ, (ν−1, ω))ν · (ν, (ω−1, φ))ω · (ω, (φ−1, ν))φ = 1

(where αβ means βαβ−1). It is thus suﬃcient to show that (ν, (ω−1, φ)) and (ω, (φ−1, ν))
belong to VJ . Since they are formally similar, let us deal with (ν, (ω−1, φ)) only. We compute
that

(ν, (ω−1, φ)) = (Adv∗ , (Adw∗, φ)) = Ad(v∗,w∗φ(w)).

12

Since w∗φ(w) ∈ H,

(w∗φ(w), v∗) ∈ (H, UA) = (UJ , UA) ⊆ UJ .

Thus, Ad(v∗,w∗φ(w)) ∈ VJ , as desired.

Finally, let us prove that the ideal J agrees with the ideal I from the statement of the
theorem. Recall that [H, A] is spanned by the elements uau∗ − a = Adua − a, where u ∈ H
and a ∈ A; i.e., where Adu ∈ G and a ∈ A. The inclusion J ⊆ I is then clear. To prove
the opposite inclusion, let φ ∈ G and let us show that φ(x) − x ∈ J for all x. Notice that
H is invariant under φ, since φ · Adu = Adφ(u). So J is invariant under φ. Let ˜φ denote

the automorphism induced by φ in the quotient eA = A/J. We wish to show that ˜φ is the
identity map. Since φ(u)u∗ ∈ H for all u ∈ UA, ˜φ(u)u∗ belongs to the center of eA for all

u ∈ U eA. That an approximately inner automorphism with this property must be the identity
we prove in the lemma below and with this conclude the proof of the theorem.

Lemma 3.11. If φ is an approximately inner automorphism such that φ(u)u∗ is in the
center of A for all u ∈ UA then φ is the identity.

Proof. The assumption on φ implies that u 7→ φ(u)u∗ is a group homomorphism with abelian
range. Hence φ(u)u∗ = 1 for all u ∈ (UA, UA); i.e., φ is the identity on (UA, UA). From
φ(eitc) = eitc for all c ∈ [A, A]∩ Asa and t ∈ R we deduce that φ(c) = c for all c ∈ [A, A]∩ Asa.
The set [A, A] ∩ Asa spans [A, A] so φ is the identity on [A, A]. Now, since φ is approximately
inner, φ(x) − x ∈ [A, A]. So φ(φ(x) − x)) = φ(x) − x for all x; i.e., φ2(x) = 2φ(x) − x for all x.
Exploiting the multiplicativity of the left side we get (2φ(x)−x)(2φ(y)−y) = 2φ(x)φ(y)−xy
for all x, y which, after simple manipulations, implies that (φ(x) − x)(φ(y) − y) = 0 for all
x, y. Setting y = x∗ we get φ(x) = x for all x, as desired.

In [ER93] Elliott and Rørdam prove that VA is topologically simple if A is a simple unital
C*-algebra of real rank zero, stable rank one, and having strict comparison of projections.
They then conjecture that VA is topologically simple for any simple A. The following
corollary proves this:

Corollary 3.12. If A is a simple C∗-algebra then VA is a topologically simple group.

Proof. Let G be a closed subgroup of VA such that G 6= {1}. By the previous theorem
VI ⊆ G where I = Id({φ(x) − x | x ∈ A, φ ∈ G}). But I is non-zero, since G 6= {1}. So
I = A, by the simplicity of A, and G = VA.

4 Non-closed Lie ideals revisited

In order to extend the results from the previous sections to non-closed normal subgroups we
rely on results for non-closed Lie ideals. The statement of these results (e.g., in [Rob14])
are not quantitative enough to be directly used for our purposes here. Instead, we need to
re-examine the mechanics of their proofs. We do so in this section.

In the sequel by polynomial we always mean a polynomial in noncommuting variables with

coeﬃcients in C.

Let πn(x1, . . . , x2n ) be the polynomial deﬁned by π0(x) = x and

πn+1(x1, . . . , x2n+1) = [πn(x1, . . . , x2n), πn(x2n+1, . . . , x2n+1)]

(4.1)

13

for all n ≥ 0.

Lemma 4.1. Let a, b, c, x1, . . . , x8 be noncommuting variables.

(i) The polynomial [a[x1, x2]b, c] is expressible as a sum whose terms have either the form
[xi, r] or [[xi, r], s], where i = 1, 2 and where r and s are polynomials in the variables
a, b, c, x1, x2.

(ii) The polynomial [aπ3(x1, . . . , x8)b, c] is expressible as a sum whose terms have either
the form [xi, [r, s]] or [[xi, [r, s]], [r′, s′]], where i = 1, . . . , 8 and where r, s, r′, s′ are
polynomials in the variables a, b, c, x1, . . . , x8.

Proof. (i) We have

a[x1, x2]b = ab[x1, x2] + a[[x1, x2], b]

= ab[x1, x2] + a[x1, [x2, b]] − a[x2, [x1, b]].

Using that x[y, z] = [y, xz] − [y, x]z, the ﬁrst and second term on the right can be further
manipulated as follows (the third term is formally as the second):

ab[x1, x2] = [x1, abx2] − [x1, ab]x2,

a[x1, [x2, b]] = [x1, a[x2, b]] − [x1, a][x2, b].

We now apply [·, c] on both sides and break up the products on the right side using that
[xy, c] = [x, yc] + [y, cx]. This yields the desired result.

(ii) By (i), [aπ3(x1, . . . , x8)b, c] is a sum of terms of the form [π2, r] and [[π2, r], s], where r
and s are polynomials and where π2 is evaluated on either (x1, . . . , x4) or (x5, . . . , x8). Let
us show that these terms are expressible in the form required by the lemma. This follows
essentially by repeated applications of Jacobi’s identity. For the terms [π2, r] we have that

[π2(x1, . . . , x4), r] = [[[x1, x2], [x3, x4]], r]

= [[x1, x2], [[x3, x4], r]] − [[x3, x4], [[x1, x2], r]].

Elements of the form [[xi, xj], [u, v]], as on the right side, can be expressed as

[xi, [xj, [u, v]]] − [xj, [xi, [u, v]]],

whose terms are as required. On the terms [[π2, r], s] we ﬁrst express [π2, r] as a sum whose
terms have the form [xi, [xj, [u, v]]], as argued above, and then use that

[[xi, [xj, [u, v]]], s] = [xi, [[xj, [u, v]], s]] − [[xj, [u, v]], [xi, s]].

The terms on the right side are again as required.

Let A be a C∗-algebra. Let N c

2 denote the subset of N2 ⊆ A deﬁned as follows:

N c

2 = {x ∈ A | ∃e, f ∈ A+ such that f x = xe = x and ef = 0}.

N c

2 is dense in N2 ([Rob14, Section 4]).

14

Lemma 4.2. Let x ∈ N c

2 and r ∈ A. Then

[x, r] = z1 + z2 + z3 + z4 + (1 + z5)x(1 − z5),

for some z1, z2, z3, z4, z5 ∈ N c

2 such that kzik ≤ kxk · krk for all i.

Proof. Here we follow closely the proof of [Rob14, Lemma 4.1]. If either x = 0 or r = 0 then
the lemma is trivial. Let us then assume that kxk = krk = 1. The general case reduces to
this one by rescaling. Let e, f ∈ A+ be such that f x = ex = x and ef = 0. Using functional
calculus, let us modify e and f so that they are contractions. Also with functional calculus,
applied to e, let us ﬁnd e0, e1, e2, e3 ∈ A+ such that eiei+1 = ei+1 for i = 0, 1, 2 and xe3 = x;
we ﬁnd similarly f0, f1, f2, f3 ∈ A+ such that fifi+1 = fi+1 for i = 0, 1, 2 and f3x = x.

Let r ∈ A.

[x, r] = (1 − e1)rx + [e1rf1, x] − xr(1 − f1).

One readily checks that 1 − e2 and e3 are units on the left and on the right respectively for
the ﬁrst term. Similarly, f3 and 1 − f2 are units on the left and on the right for the last
term. Thus, these terms are contractions in N c

2 . As for the middle term, we have that

[e1rf1, x] = (1 + e1rf1)x(1 − e1rf1) + (e1rf1)x(e1rf1) − x.

The ﬁrst term on the right has the form (1 + z)x(1 − z), where z ∈ N c
other two are contractions in N c
2 as well. The lemma is thus proved.

2 is a contraction. The

there exists K ∈ N and C > 0 such that for each c, d ∈ A we have

[c, d] =

KXi=1

for some y1, . . . , yK ∈ N2 such that kyik ≤ Ckck · kdk for all i.

Proof. This theorem is contained [Rob14, Theorem 4.2], except that we have added the norm
bound on the elements yi.

Since A has no 1-dimensional representations, A = Id([A, A]). We have

Id([A, A]) = Id([[A, A], [A, A]]) = Id([N2, N2]) = Id([N c

2 , N c

Hence, A = Id([N c

Let c, d ∈ A. If c = 0 or d = 0 the theorem holds trivially. So assume that c 6= 0 and d 6= 0,
and then, after rescaling, that kck = kdk = 1. Multiplying by c and taking commutator by
d in (4.2) we get

[c, d] =

[cai[xi, yi]bi, d].

By Lemma 4.1 (i), the i-th term of the sum on the right is expressible as a sum whose terms

The elements r(j)
are all polynomials in c, d, ai, xi, yi, bi. In particular, their norms
are uniformly bounded for c and d of norm 1 (we regard ai, xi, yi, bi as ﬁxed). Therefore, it
suﬃces to show that for each x ∈ N c
2 and r, s ∈ A such that krk, ksk ≤ M the elements [x, r]
and [[x, r], s] can be written as sums of elements in N2 controlling the number of elements
and their norms. Let us consider a term of the form [x, r] By Lemma 4.2,

[x, r] = z1 + z2 + z3 + z4 + (1 + z5)x(1 − z5),

with zi ∈ N2 and kzik ≤ kxk · krk for all i. Taking commutator with s we get

[[x, r], s] =

4Xi=1

[zi, s] + (1 + z5)[x, s′](1 − z5),

where s′ = (1 − z5)s(1 + z5). By Lemma 4.2, the terms [zi, s] for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 and [x, s′] are
again sums of ﬁve elements of N2 whose norms are bounded from above. Thus, both [x, r]
and [[x, r], s] can be expressed as sums of at most 25 of elements in N2 with a uniform bound
on their norms.

[Rob14, Corollary 3.8]). Let A be a unital C∗-algebra containing a
Theorem 4.4 (Cf.
projection p such that both p and 1 − p are full (i.e., they each generate A as a closed
two-sided ideal). Then there exists K ∈ N such that for any contraction c ∈ A there exist
projections p1, . . . , pK ∈ A such that

Proof. Let P denote the set of projections of A. By the assumption of fullness of p and 1 − p,
we have that A = Id([P, A]) (because in A/Id([P, A]) the projections p and 1−p become both
central and full). Since span(P ) is a Lie ideal ([MM98, Theorem 4.2]), Id([P, A]) = Id([P, P ]).
(In general, Id([L, L]) = Id([L, A]) for any Lie ideal L; this is a consequence of Herstein’s
[Her70, Theorem 1] applied in A/Id([L, L]).) Thus, there exist x1, y1, · · · , xm, ym ∈ A and

(4.4)

Let us focus on one of the terms of the form [p, r] where p = pi and r = r(j)
for some i and
j. Since r is a polynomial in c and c∗ with coeﬃcients in A, there exists M > 0 such that
krk ≤ M for all contractions c. Enlarging the number of terms [p, r] if necessary (by an
amount depending on M but independent of c) let us assume that krk ≤ 1. Since [c∗, c] is
selfadjoint, we can replace [p, r], on the right side of (4.4), by its selfadjoint part. Thus, we
may assume that r is skewadjoint. For each x ∈ pA(1 − p) such that kxk ≤ 1 let us deﬁne

A straightforward computation shows that q(x) is a projection. Now let x = pr(1 − p). Then

[p, r] =(cid:18) 0

x∗ 0(cid:19) = q(x) − q(−x).

Let us consider the terms of the form [[p, r], s]. Enlarging the number of terms again we
may assume that krk ≤ 1 and ksk ≤ 1. Braking up r and s into the sum of a selfadjoint
and a skewadjoint and taking the selfadjoint part of [[p, r], s] we can assume that either both
r and s are selfadjoint or both are skewadjoint. The ﬁrst case reduces to the second by
setting [[p, r], s]] = [[p, ir], −is].
In the case that both r and s are skewadjoint we apply
twice the argument used above for terms [p, r] with r skewadjoint. We thus ﬁnd that the
selfadjoint parts of [p, r] and [[p, r], s] are expressible as sums whose terms have the form ǫq,
with ǫ = ±1 and q a projection. Applying this to each term on the right side of (4.4) proves
the theorem.

5 Non-closed normal subgroups of invertibles

As before, A denotes a C∗-algebra. In this section we prove results on normal subgroups of
GA that are not assumed to be closed at the outset (and may well fail to be so). Our strategy
is again to relate normal subgroups to Lie ideals, which may not be closed either. We also
look closer into the properties of the exponential map in a small neighborhood of the iden-
tity. Theorem 5.1 below is a simple consequence of the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorﬀ formula.
Theorem 5.2 follows from the formalism associated to the ﬁrst Kashiwara-Vergne equation,
as developed by Rouvi`ere in [Rou14]. Both theorems will be proven in the appendix.

Theorem 5.1. Let x, y ∈ A be such that kxk, kyk < log 2
a(x, y) ∈ A and b = b(x, y) ∈ A, depending continuously on x and y, such that

8 . Then there exist elements a =

exey = ex+y+[x,a]+[y,b],

and a(0, 0) = b(0, 0) = 0. Moreover, if x and y are skewadjoint then so are a and b.

Proof. See Theorem 7.3 of the Appendix.

Theorem 5.2. There exists ǫ > 0 such that if x, y ∈ A are such that kxk, kyk ≤ ǫ then there
exist R = R(x, y) ∈ A and S = S(x, y) ∈ A, depending continuously on x and y, such that

Proof. See Theorem 7.5 of the Appendix.
Lemma 5.3. Let A be a C∗-algebra. Let b1, . . . , bn ∈ A. Then eb1 · · · ebn and ePn

i=1 bi are

Proof. For elements g, h ∈ GA let us write g ∼ h if they are equal modulo (GA, GA);
i.e.,gh−1 ∈ (GA, GA). It suﬃces to show that eb1eb2 ∼ eb1+b2. Let N ∈ N. Let us choose

Theorem 5.4. Let A be a C∗-algebra. The following describe the group (GA, GA):

(a) the group generated by the set {e[c,d] | c, d ∈ A},

(b) the set of elements of the form eb1eb2 · · · ebn where Pn

If A is unital and has no 1-dimensional representations then (GA, GA) is also equal to

i=1 bi ∈ [A, A].

(c) the group generated by 1 + N2.

Moreover, in this case (GA, GA) is a perfect group.

Proof. It is clear that the group described in (a) is contained in the group described in
(b). Let us prove that the latter is contained in (GA, GA). By Lemma 5.3, proving that

Qn
i=1 ebi ∈ (GA, GA) forPi=1 bi ∈ [A, A] reduces to proving that eb ∈ (GA, GA) for b ∈ [A, A].

Next let us show that (GA, GA) is contained in the group described in (a). Call the latter
group H. Notice that H is normal in GA. Thus, as argued above in similar situations, to
prove that (GA, GA) ⊆ H it suﬃces to prove that (b, ea) ∈ H for all b ∈ GA and a ∈ A, and
we can assume that a is small (how small to be speciﬁed below). By Theorem 5.1 for a small
enough we have that

(b, ea) = ebab−1

e−a

= ebab−1−a+[bab−1,x]−[a,y],

for some x, y ∈ A. Observe that bab−1 − a + [bab−1, x] − [a, y] ∈ [A, A]. Thus, it suﬃces to

for all c, d ∈ A. By Theorem 4.3, there exist y1, . . . , yK ∈ N2 such that [c, d] = PK

Finally, suppose that A is unital and has no 1-dimensional representations. Let U2 denote
the group generated by 1 + N2. Observe that U2 is normal. We already know, by Lemma
2.5, that U2 ⊆ ((GA, GA), (GA, GA)). Thus, once we have shown that (GA, GA) ⊆ U2 it will
both follow that U2 = (GA, GA) and that (GA, GA) is perfect. Let us show that e[c,d] ∈ U2
i=1 yi.
Let us show that the exponential of a ﬁnite sum of elements in N2 belongs to U2. This is
certainly true for sums of one term: ey = 1 + y ∈ U2 for y ∈ N2. Suppose it is true for sums
of K − 1 terms. Let y1, . . . , yK ∈ N2. Let N ∈ N. Let us choose N large enough such that

Proposition 5.5. Let A be a C∗-algebra. Let H be a subgroup of GA containing (GA, GA).
Then there exists an additive subgroup L ⊆ A containing [A, A] such that

We now prove the main result of the section.

Theorem 5.6. Let A be a unital C∗-algebra. Let H be a subgroup of GA normalized by
(GA, GA) and such that A = Id([H, A]). Then (GA, GA) ⊆ H.

Proof. To prove that (GA, GA) ⊆ H it suﬃces, by Theorem 5.4, to show that e[c,d] ∈ H for
all c, d ∈ A. Before doing so we establish some preparatory results.

Let

Λ = {hah−1 − a | h ∈ H, a ∈ [A, A]}.

Our ﬁrst goal is to show that Id(π3(Λ)) = A, where π3 is the polynomial deﬁned in (4.1).
(Here and below π3(S, . . . , S) is abbreviated to π3(S) for various sets S ⊆ A.) To prove

this, consider ﬁrst the ideal Id([Λ, A]). Let eA denote the quotient of A by this ideal and let
eH denote the image of H in this quotient. Let h ∈ eH and a ∈ [eA, eA]. Then hah−1 − a is
a central element in eA. In particular, it commutes with h. Hence, (hah−1 − a)h = [h, a]
commutes with h; i.e., [h, [h, a]] = 0 for all a ∈ [eA, eA]. By Herstein’s theorem, [h, a] = 0 for all
a ∈ [eA, eA]. In particular, [h, [h, b]] = 0 for all b ∈ ˜A. By Herstein’s theorem again, [h, b] = 0.

Hence, [H, A] ⊆ Id([Λ, A]), and since we have assumed that [H, A] is full, Id([Λ, A]) = A.
Next notice that span(Λ) is a closed subspace invariant under conjugation by (GA, GA).
Hence, by [Rob14, Theorem 2.6], it is a Lie ideal of A. From the deﬁnition of Λ we see
clearly that span(Λ) is contained in [A, A]. Moreover, Id([span(Λ), A]) = Id([Λ, A]) = A. It
follows by [Rob14, Lemma 1.6] that span(Λ) = [A, A]. Since π3 is a multilinear polynomial,
we have Id(π3(Λ)) = Id(π3([A, A])). But π3([A, A]) = [A, A], by [Rob14, Corollary 2.8], and
Id([A, A]) = A by assumption. Hence, Id(π3(Λ)) = A, as desired.

Since A is unital and π3(Λ) is a full set there exist x1, . . . , xm ∈ Λ8 and y1, z1, . . . , ym, zm ∈

A such that

For each i = 1, . . . , m let’s say that

i,8 − ai,8),

where hi,1, . . . , hi,8 ∈ H and ai,1, . . . , ai,8 ∈ [A, A].

Let h ∈ H and a ∈ [A, A]. Let t ∈ R be nonzero. Let us deﬁne

Wt(h, a) =

1
t

log((h, eta)).

Since (h, eta) → 1 as t → 0, Wt(h, a) is deﬁned for small enough t. Notice that

Hence, if we set

Wt(h, a) = hah−1 − a =: W0(h, a).

then y(t) → 1 as t → 0. In particular, there exists δ > 0 such that y(t) is invertible for all
|t| ≤ δ. We thus have that

1 =

(5.2)

Let c, d ∈ A. Multiplying by c and taking commutator with d in (5.1) we get that

[c, d] =

[yi(t)π3(xi(t))zi, d],

mXi=1

for all |t| ≤ δ, where we have set yi(t) = cy(t)−1yi. By Lemma 4.1, for each i = 1, . . . , m
the term [yi(t)π3(xi(t))zi, d] is expressible as a sum whose terms have either the form
[Wt(h, a), [r, s]] or the form [[Wt(h, a), [r, s]], [r′, s′]]. That is,

[c, d] =Xi,l Xr,s

[Wt(hi,l, ai,l), [r, s]] +Xi,l Xr,s,r′,s′

[[Wt(hi,l, ai,l), [r, s]], [r′, s′]]

Here i = 1, . . . , m, l = 1, . . . , 8, and for each i, l the inner sums run through ﬁnitely many
polynomials r, s, r′, s′ on yi(t), Wt(hi,l, ai,l), zi, d. Note that r, s, r′, s′ are continuous functions
of t. Let us consider ﬁrst the terms of the form [Wt(h, a), [r, s]]. By Theorem 4.3, we have

i=1 yi for some y1, . . . , yK ∈ N2 such that kyik ≤ Ckrk · ksk for all i. So

[r, s] =PK

[Wt(h, a), [r, s]] =

[Wt(h, a), yi].

KXi=1

(5.3)

Let us abbreviate f zf−1 to f · z. On each term [Wt(h, a), yi] on the right of (5.3) let us use
that

) · a(cid:17).

(5.4)

Notice that (1 + z)h(1 − z) ∈ H for all z ∈ N2 since H is normalized by (GA, GA). So in this
way we can express an element of the form [Wt(h, a), [r, s]] as a sum whose terms have the
form Wt(h′, a′), where h′ ∈ H and a′ ∈ [A, A] are similarity conjugates of h and a respectively.
The same argument used twice yields that elements of the form [[Wt(h, a), [r, s]], [r′, s′]] are
expressible as sums whose terms have the form Wt(h′′, a′′), where h′′ ∈ H and a′′ ∈ [A, A]
are similarity conjugates of h and a. In summary, we have shown that

[c, d] =

MXj=1

Wt(h′j , a′j),

(5.5)

for some h′1, . . . , h′M ∈ H and a′1, . . . , a′M ∈ [A, A] which depend on t. We claim however
that M is independent of t and that the norms of the elements h′j and a′j are uniformly
bounded for all |t| ≤ δ. The number of terms in (5.5) resulted from starting with (5.2),
expanding each of its terms ﬁrst using Lemma 4.1, then using Theorem 4.3 on the new terms

21

to get (5.3), and further applying (5.4). These last two steps were repeated on terms of the
form [[Wt(h, a), [r, s]], [r′, s′]]. This makes it clear that M is independent from t. Since the
elements r, s, r′, s′ depend continuosly on t their norms are uniformly bounded on |t| ≤ δ.
Then Theorem 4.3 and inspection of (5.4) guarantee the uniform boundedness of the ﬁnal
h′js and a′js on |t| ≤ δ.

Let’s multiply by t on both sides of (5.5) and then exponentiate:

et[c,d] = e

(5.6)

Let us show that the right side belongs to H for small enough t. Indeed, for small enough

bounded on |t| ≤ δ. We then get that

(5.7)

Observe that, by Theorem 5.1,

Wt(h′j, a′j) = h′ja′j(h′j)−1 − a′j + [·, ·] + [·, ·] ∈ [A, A]

for all j. Then Theorem 5.2 guarantees that R, S ∈ [A, A]. It is also true that a′j ∈ [A, A]
for all j, since each a′j is conjugate to some ai,l ∈ [A, A]. Hence, by Theorem5.4, eR, eS ∈
(GA, GA) and eta′
j ∈ (GA, GA) for all j and t. Since we have assumed that H is normalized
by (GA, GA),

eRetWt(h′

1,a′

1)e−R = eR(h1, eta′

That is, the ﬁrst factor on the right of (5.7) is in H. Continuing the same argument induc-
tively we conclude that the right side of (5.6) belongs to H for small enough t. Hence, et[c,d]
belongs to H for small enough t. Since e[c,d] = (e[c,d]/n)n for all n ∈ N, e[c,d] belongs to H
for all c, d ∈ A, as desired.

Proof of Theorem 1.2 from the introduction. This is simply Proposition 5.5 and Theorem
5.4 put together.

For a simple unital A we obtain as a corollary a multiplicative analogue of [Her69, Theorem

1.12].

Corollary 5.7. Let A be a simple unital C∗-algebra. Let H be a subgroup of GA normalized
by (GA, GA). Then either H is contained in the center of A or (GA, GA) ⊆ H. The group
(GA, GA) is simple modulo its center.

Proof. Suppose that H is not contained in the center of A. Then Id([H, A]) 6= {0} and so
Id([H, A]) = A by the simplicity of A. By the previous theorem, (GA, GA) = (H, GA) ⊆
H.

Suppose that A also satisﬁes (b). Let a ∈ GA be in the kernel of the determinant map.
Let us write a = eb1 · · · ebn, with b1, . . . , bn ∈ A. Let p, q ∈ M∞(A) be projections such that
i=1 bi − 2πiTr(p − q) ∈ [A, A]. By assumption, we can choose c, d ∈ Asa such that Tr(p) − c
and Tr(q) − d are in [A, A] and e2πic and e2πid in (GA, GA). Then

Pn

a = (eb1 · · · ebne−2πice2πid) · (e−2πid) · (e2πic).

The three factors on the right side are in (GA, GA) either by assumption or by Theorem
5.4.

A C∗-algebra is called pure if its Cuntz semigroup is both almost divisible and almost
unperforated. By results of [NR14] the hypotheses of the theorem above are satisﬁed if A
is a unital pure C∗-algebra whose bounded 2-quasitraces are traces. That [A, A] = [A, A]
in this case is shown in [NR14, Theorem 4.10]. That for each projection p ∈ M∞(A) there
exists h ∈ Asa such that Tr(p) − h ∈ [A, A] and e2πih ∈ (GA, GA) is shown in [NR14, Lemma
6.2]. We thus obtain the following corollary:
Corollary 5.9. Let A be unital pure C∗-algebra whose bounded 2-quastraces are traces. Then
the kernel of the de la Harpe-Skandalis determinant on GA agrees with (GA, GA).

6 Non-closed normal subgroups of unitaries

In this section we prove results on non-closed normal subgroups of UA. We follow the same
general strategy from the last section, so in some passages our arguments will be more
succint.

Lemma 6.1. Let A be a C*-algebra and b1, . . . , bn ∈ Asa. Then eib1 · · · eibn is equal to
ei Pn

i=1 bi modulo (UA, UA).

Proof. The same proof used in Lemma 5.3 applies here. It must be kept in mind that in
Theorem 5.2 if the elements x and y are skewadjoint then R and S also are, and so eR and
eS are unitaries.

Theorem 6.2. Let A be a C∗-algebra. The following describe the group (UA, UA):

(a) the group generated by {ei[c∗,c] | c ∈ A},

(b) the elements of the form eib1 · · · · · eibn with Pn

If A is unital and without 1-dimensional representations then (UA, UA) is also equal to

i=1 bi ∈ [A, A] and bi ∈ Asa for all i.

(c) the group generated by {ei[x∗,x] | x ∈ N2}.

Moreover, in this case the group (UA, UA) is perfect.

Proof. It is clear that the group described in (a) is contained in the one described in (b).
Let us prove that the latter is contained in (UA, UA). By Lemma 6.1 it suﬃces to show that
eib ∈ (UA, UA) for b ∈ [A, A] ∩ Asa. Observe that

[A, A] = [UA, A] = {uau∗ − a | u ∈ UA, a ∈ A}.

So if b ∈ [A, A] ∩ Asa then b can be expressed as a sumPn

j=1 ujaju∗j − ai for some uj ∈ UA
and aj ∈ A. Taking the selfadjoint part of this sum we may assume that aj ∈ Asa for all j.
Then, by Lemm 6.1,

eib ∼

nYj=1

euj (iaj )u∗

j e−iaj =

(uj, eiaj ) ∈ (UA, UA).

nYj=1

Let us show next that (UA, UA) is contained in the group described in (a). Call this group
H. Observe that H is normal in UA. It thus suﬃces to show that (u, eia) ∈ H for all u ∈ UA
and a ∈ Asa, and a can be chosen small. Let us choose a small enough such that, by Theorem
5.1,

(u, eia) = ei(uau∗−a)+i[uau∗,x]−i[a,y],

for some x and y skewadjoint. It now suﬃces to show that if c ∈ [A, A]∩Asa then eic ∈ H. The
selfadjoint part of a commutator [e, f ] can always be expressed in the form [z∗, z] + [(z′)∗, z′]
N and

j=1[z∗j , zj] for some zj ∈ A. We consider ei c

(see [Mar06, Theorem 2.4]). So c = Pm

choose N large enough such that, by Theorem 5.2,

ei c

N = (eRe

i
N [z ∗

j ,zj]e−R) · eSe

Pm

j=2

i
N [z ∗

j ,zj]e−S.

Notice that Theorem 5.2 guarantees that R, S are skewadjoint, so eR, eS ∈ UA. The ﬁrst
factor on the right side is in H, so we can continue arguing inductively that ei c
N ∈ H for
large enough N . This in turn implies that eic ∈ H, as desired.

Finally, suppose that A is unital and has no 1-dimensional representations. Let U2 denote
the group described in (c). Observe that U2 is normal. We already know, by Lemma 3.5,
that U2 ⊆ ((UA, UA), (UA, UA)). Thus, once we have shown that (UA, UA) ⊆ U2 it will both
follow that U2 = (UA, UA) and that (UA, UA) is perfect. Let us show that ei[c∗,c] ∈ U2 for all
j=1 yj. Since the
left side is selfadjoint, we can replace the right side by its selfadjoint part. For y ∈ N2 we have
y+y∗
j=1[z∗j , zj], where
j ,zj] belongs to U2 we again proceed inductively,

c ∈ A. By Theorem 4.3, there exist y1, . . . , yK ∈ N2 such that [c∗, c] =PK
2 = [z∗, z] for some z ∈ N2, by [NR14, Lemma 5.1]. Thus, [c∗, c] =PK
zj ∈ N2 for all j. To prove that ei PK

In the proof of Theorem 6.3 below—the analogue of Theorem 5.6—we cannot make the
arguments go through without these additonal restrictions: we assume that the C∗-algebra
has two full orthogonal projections and we deal only with normal subgroups of UA rather
than normalized by (UA, UA).

Theorem 6.3. Let A be a unital C*-algebra containing two full orthogonal projections. Let
H be a normal subgroup of UA such that Id([H, UA]) = A. Then (UA, UA) ⊆ H.

Proof. In view of the previous theorem, to prove that (UA, UA) ⊆ H it suﬃces to show that
ei[c∗,c] ∈ H for all c ∈ A (or even in c ∈ N2, but we will not need this).

Let Λ = {uau∗ − a | u ∈ H, a ∈ Asa}. We claim that Id(π3(Λ)) = A. To prove this, notice
ﬁrst that span(Λ) = [H, A]. Since span(H) is a closed subspace invariant under conjugation
by UA, it is a Lie ideal (by [MM98, Theorem 2.3]). Hence, by [BKS08, Theorem 5.27] applied
to span(H),

[H, A] = [Id([H, A]), A] = [[A, A], A] = [A, A].

So span(Λ) = [A, A]. From this, and continuing to argue as in the proof of Theorem 5.6, we
conclude that Id(π3(Λ)) = A, as claimed.

Continuing with the argument of Theorem 5.6, we get that there exist x1, . . . , xm ∈ Λ8

and y1, z1, . . . , ym, zm ∈ A such that

1 =

mXi=1

yiπ3(xi)zi.

Say

xi = (ui,1ai,1u∗i,1 − ai,1, . . . , ui,1ai,8u∗i,8 − ai,8),
for all i = 1, . . . , m, where ui,1, . . . , ui,8 ∈ H and ai,1, . . . , ai,8 ∈ Asa.

25

As in the proof of Theorem 5.6, let us deﬁne Wt(u, a) = 1

it log((u, eita)) for u ∈ H, a ∈ Asa
and t ∈ R small enough and non-zero. Set W0(u, a) = uau∗ − a so that Wt(u, a) → W0(u, a)
as t → 0. Let

xi(t) = (Wt(ui,1, ai,1), . . . , Wt(ui,8, ai,8))

and

y(t) =

yiπ3(xi(t))zi.

mXi=1

Then y(t) → 1 as t → 0. In particular, there exists δ > 0 such that y(t) is invertible for
|t| ≤ δ. We thus have that

1 =

for all |t| ≤ δ.

Let c ∈ A. Then

y(t)−1yiπ3(xi(t))zi,

mXi=1
mXi=1

[c∗, c] =

[yi(t)π3(xi(t))zi, c]

(6.1)

for all |t| ≤ δ, where we have set yi(t) = c∗y(t)−1yi. By Lemma 4.1, each [yi(t)π3(xi(t))zi, c]
on the right side is expressible as a sum whose terms have either the form [Wt(u, a), [r, s]] or
the form [[Wt(u, a), [r, s]], [r′, s′]]:

[c∗, c] =Xi,l Xr,s

[Wt(ui,l, ai,l), [r, s]] +Xi,l Xr,s,r′,s′

[[Wt(ui,l, ai,l), [r, s]], [r′, s′]]

(6.2)

Here i = 1, . . . , m, l = 1, . . . , 8, and for each i, l the inner sums run through a number of
polynomials r, s, r′, s′ on yi(t), Wt(ui,l, ai,l), zi, d. Notice that in particular these polynomials
depend continuously on t. At this point our arguments diverge from the proof of Theorem
5.6. We do not wish to express [Wt(u, a), [r, s]] as a sum of similarity conjugates of Wt(u, a),
but rather, unitary conjugates. First, taking selfadjoint part in (6.2), and keeping in mind
that Wt(u, a) is selfadjoint, we can replace [r, s] in the terms of the form [Wt(h, a), [r, s]] by
its skewadjoint part. Say r = r1 + ir2 and s = s1 + is2, with r1, r2, s1, s2 ∈ Asa. Then the
skewadjoint part of [r, s] can be computed to equal

i
2

[(r1 + is1)∗, r1 + is1] +

i
2

[(r2 + is2)∗, r2 + is2]

(see [Mar06, Theorem 2.4]). Thus, the selfadjoint parts of the terms [Wt(u, a), [r, s]] can be
expanded into sums of two terms of the form [Wt(u, a), i[z∗, z]]. Similarly, the selfadjoint
parts of elements of the form [[Wt(u, a), [r, s], [r′, s′]]] can be expanded into sums of four ele-
ments of the form [[Wt(u, a), i[z∗, z]], i[(z′)∗, z′]]. The elements z and z′ depend continuously
on t. This implies that kzk and kz′k are uniformly bounded for all |t| ≤ δ. Thus, by en-
larging the number of terms of the forms [Wt(u, a), i[z∗, z]] and [[Wt(u, a), i[z∗, z]], i[(z′)∗, z′]]
if necessary we may assume that kzk ≤ 1 and kz′k ≤ 1. Then, by Theorem 4.4, 1
2 [z∗, z] is
expressible as a sum of elements of the form ±p, where p is a projection. Put diﬀerently,
[z∗, z] is a sum of elements of the form (±2)p. So we get that

[Wt(u, a), i[z∗, z]] =

[Wt(h, a), 2iǫkpk],

KXk=1

(6.3)

26

for some projections p1, . . . , pK and ǫk = ±1 for all k. Now we use that for any projection p
we have

[Wt(u, a), 2ip] = vpWt(u, a)v∗p − v∗pWt(u, a)vp,

(6.4)

where vp = p + i(1 − p) is a unitary. Since vW (u, a)v∗ = W (vuv∗, vav∗), we obtain
[Wt(u, a), i[z∗, z]] expressed as a sum of elements of the form Wt(u′, a′) where u′ and a′
are unitary conjugates of u and a (hence u′ ∈ H). The same argument applied twice also
implies that elements of the form [[Wt(u, a), i[z∗, z]], i[(z′)∗, z′]] are expressible as sums whose
terms have the form Wt(u′′, a′′), where u′′ ∈ H and a′′ ∈ Asa are unitary conjugates of u and
a. In summary, we have shown that

[c∗, c] =

MXj=1

Wt(u′j, a′j),

(6.5)

for some u′1, . . . , u′M ∈ H and a′1, . . . , a′M ∈ Asa which depend on t. We claim however that M
is independent of t and that the norms of the elements u′j and a′j are uniformly bounded for
all |t| ≤ δ. The number of terms in (6.5) resulted as follows: starting from (6.1) we expanded
expanding each of its terms using Lemma 4.1. The new terms were expanded further so as
to have terms of the forms [Wt(u, a), i[z∗, z]] and [[Wt(u, a), i[z∗, z]], i[(z′)∗, z′]]. At this point
we observed that the norms of z and z′ were bounded by a constant independent of t. So
these terms could be expanded further so as to have kzk ≤ 1 and kz′k ≤ 1. We then used
Theorem 4.4 to get (6.3) and ﬁnally (6.4). This makes it clear that M is independent from
t. The elements u′i and a′i apperaing in (6.5) are all unitary conjugates of the initial set of
elements. Hence their norms are independent of t.

Let’s multiply by it on both sides of (6.5) and then exponentiate:

eit[c∗,c] = e

(6.6)

Since the norms of Wt(u′j, a′j) are bounded on |t| ≤ δ, for small enough t Theorem 5.2 is

(6.7)

Since we have assumed that H is normal, the ﬁrst factor on the right side of (6.7) is in H.
Continuing the same argument inductively we conclude that the right side of (6.6) belongs
to H for small enough t. Hence, et[c∗,c] belongs to H for small enough t which in turn implies
that e[c∗,c] belongs to H for all c ∈ A, as desired.

Corollary 6.4. Let A be a simple unital C∗-algebra contaning a non-trivial projection. Let
H be a normal subgroup of UA. Then either H is contained in the center of UA or H contains
(UA, UA).

Here we prove Theorems 5.1 and 5.2.

7.1 Proof of Theorem 5.1

In order to justify analytically some formal manipulations we sometimes work in the setting
of a free Banach algebra. Let E = C ⊕ C. Let us denote by X and Y the canonical basis of
E. Let An(X, Y) = E⊗n for n ≥ 1. Let

A[X, Y] =

A[[X, Y]] =

An(X, Y),

An(X, Y),

∞Mn=1
∞Yn=1

A[X, Y] is the free non-unital algebra in the variables X and Y. We regard the elements of
A[X, Y] as polynomials in the noncommuting variables X and Y. We regard the elements of
A[[X, Y]] as formal power series in X and Y.

Let us endow E with the ℓ1 norm and then An(X, Y) = E⊗n with the projective tensor
product norm (i.e., the ℓ1 norm after identifying E⊗n with C2n
). Let A(X, Y) denote the
Banach algebra of ℓ1 convergent series in A[[X, Y]] endowed with the ℓ1 norm. We have the
inclusions A[X, Y] ⊆ A(X, Y) ⊆ A[[X, Y]]. The Banach algebra A(X, Y) is the free Banach
algebra on the vector space E ([Pes95]). Given Z ∈ A(X, Y) and elements in U, V in some
Banach algebra A and of norm at most 1 we can evaluate Z(U, V ) via the universal property
of A(X, Y), i.e., by extending the assignment X 7→ U , Y 7→ V to a contractive algebra
homomorphism. The function (U, V ) 7→ Z(U, V ) is deﬁned for kU k ≤ 1 and kV k ≤ 1, and is
given by a normally convergent power series in U, V . In particular it is continuous and has
Frechet derivatives of all orders for kU k < 1 and kV k < 1.

Let t ∈ R. Deﬁne λt : E → E by λt(v) = tv for all v ∈ E and extend it to an algebra
homomorphism on A[X, Y]. Since λt maps An[X, Y] to itself we can further extend it to
A[[X, Y]]. We call λt the scaling automorphism. Notice that λt maps the Banach algebra
A(X, Y) to itself for |t| ≤ 1.

Let Ln(X, Y) ⊆ An(X, Y) denote the span of the n-iterated commutators in X and Y, i.e.,

[v1, [v2, · · · , [vn−1, vn] · · · ]] with vi ∈ E. Deﬁne also

L[X, Y ] =

L[[X, Y ]] =

Ln(X, Y ),

Ln(X, Y).

∞Mn=1
∞Yn=1

L[X, Y ] is the free Lie algebra on X, Y. Finally, let L(X, Y) denote the closure of L[X, Y ]
inside the Banach algebra A(X, Y).

Let νn : An(X, Y) → Ln(X, Y) denote the linear operator

ν(v1 · · · vn) =

1
n

[v1, [v2, · · · , [vn−1, vn] · · · ]]

for v1, . . . , vn ∈ E. The Dynkin-Specht-Wever theorem asserts that νn is the identity on
Ln(X, Y ). We can estimate that kνnk ≤ 2n. From this we deduce that λ 1
νn is a contractive
ν extends to a

map. Deﬁne ν : A[X, Y] → A[X, Y] by ν = P∞n=1 νn. Observe then λ 1

of Zn = XPn + YQn we get Zn = [X, νnPn] + [Y, νnQn], where now νnPn and νnQn are in

V (X, Y ) = log(eX eY ).

V (X, Y ) is well deﬁned for kXk + kY k < log 2.

Theorem 7.3. Let A be a Banach algebra. Let 0 < δ < log 2
functions (X, Y ) 7→ A(X, Y ) and (X, Y ) 7→ B(X, Y ) deﬁned for kXk, kY k ≤ δ such that

(7.1)

for all X, Y . If A is a C∗-algebra and X and Y are skewadjoint then so are A(X, Y ) and
B(X, Y )

Proof. We ﬁrst work in the Banach algebra A(X, Y). Since k4δXk + k4δY k < log 2 we
have V (4δX, 4δY) ∈ A(X, Y). By the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorﬀ Theorem, V (4δX, 4δY) ∈
L[[X, Y ]]. Thus, by Lemma 7.1, V (2δX, 2δY) ∈ L(X, Y). Then, by Lemma 7.2, there exist
P, Q ∈ L(X, Y) such that

V (δX, δY) = δX + δY + [X, P ] + [Y, Q].

(7.2)

δ Y ) and B(X, Y ) = Q( 1

Now let A be a Banach algebra. For X, Y ∈ A such that kXk, kY k ≤ δ deﬁne A(X, Y ) =
P ( 1
δ X, 1
δ Y ). Applying the assignment δX 7→ X, δY 7→ Y in
(7.2) we get (7.1). The functions (X, Y ) 7→ A(X, Y ) and (X, Y ) 7→ B(X, Y ) are given by
normally convergent series of iterated Lie brackets. In particular they are continuous.

δ X, 1

Suppose now that A is a C∗-algebra and that X, Y are skewadjoint elements of A. Ob-
serve that the involution σZ = −Z∗ is a continuous Lie algebra homomorphism;
i.e.,
σ[Z1, Z2] = [σZ1, σZ2]. Since A(X, Y ) is a convergent series of Lie brackets on X, Y we
get that σA(X, Y ) = A(σX, σY ) = A(X, Y ), i.e., A(X, Y ) is skewadjoint. The same argu-
ment applies to B(X, Y ).

29

7.2 Proof of Theorem 5.2

Theorem 5.2 follows essentially from the collection formulas related to the Kashiwara-Vergne
equations, as developed in [Rou14, Sections 1.1–1.5]. We have pieced together the various
parts of the argument from this reference (still referring the reader to [Rou14] for some
computations). Besides having tailored the statement of Theorem 5.2 to our purposes, our
objective here has been to make it explicit that these formulas are valid in the inﬁnite
dimensional setting of a Banach algebra (the setting in [Rou14] is either formal or ﬁnite
dimensional one).

Let A be a Banach algebra. Let X, Y ∈ A and 0 < δ < log 2

8 . We have demonstrated in

Theorem 7.3 the existence of A(X, Y ) and B(X, Y ) for kXk, kY k ≤ δ such that

V (X, Y ) = X + Y + [X, A(X, Y )] + [Y, B(X, Y )].

(7.3)

Moreover, A(X, Y ) and B(X, Y ) are expressible as normally convergent series of Lie brackets
in X and Y .

Let adX : A → A denote the map adX(Z) = [X, Z] for all Z ∈ A. Let x = adX and

y = adY . Deﬁne

F (X, Y ) =

x

e−x − 1

B(Y, X), G(X, Y ) =

ey − 1

A(Y, X).

(Our notation matches that of [Rou14, Sections 1.1–1.5], with the following exception: our
A(X, Y ) and B(X, Y ) are B(Y, X) and A(Y, X) respectively, in [Rou14, Section 1.5.2].) From
(7.3) we deduce that

V (Y, X) = X + Y − (1 − ex)F (X, Y ) − (ey − 1)G(X, Y ).

(7.4)

This is the ﬁrst Kashiwara-Vergne equation. Since e−x−1
are invertible operators for
kxk, kyk < 2π (hence, for kXk, kY k < π), F (X, Y ) and G(X, Y ) are deﬁned for kXk, kY k ≤ δ
and are normally convergent series of Lie brackets on this domain. (More formally, we can
ﬁrst deﬁne F (δX, δY) and G(δX, δY) in the Banach-Lie algebra L(X, Y) and then evaluate
them at X, Y ∈ A such that kXk, kY k ≤ δ via the assignments δX 7→ X and δY 7→ Y .)

Let us deﬁne Vt(X, Y ) = 1

t V (tX, tY ) for all X, Y ∈ A and t ∈ R non-zero and small enough
(depending on X and Y ). Deﬁne V0(X, Y ) = X + Y . Let v(t) = adVt(X,Y ) = log(etxety),
which is deﬁned also for small enough t. (We sometimes omit reference to X and Y to simplify
notation.) Let us also deﬁne Ft(X, Y ) = t−1F (tX, tY ) and Gt(X, Y ) = t−1G(tX, tY ). Then
(7.4) implies that

Vt(Y, X) = X + Y − (1 − etx)Ft(X, Y ) − (ety − 1)Gt(X, Y ),

(7.5)

for small enough t.

Let us introduce the partial diﬀerential operators: The operators ∂X Vt(X, Y ) and ∂Y Vt(X, Y )

act on Z ∈ A as follows:
d
ds

∂X Vt(X, Y ) :=

Vt(X + sZ, Y )|s=0,

∂Y Vt(X, Y ) :=

d

Vt(X, Y + sZ)|s=0.

The following formulas are given in [Rou14, Lemma 1.2] (where they are deduced from the
formula for the diﬀerential of the exponential map):

Lemma 7.4 (Cf. [Rou14, Proposition 1.3]). We have

∂tVt(X, Y ) = ∂X Vt(X, Y )[X, Ft(X, Y )] + ∂Y Vt(X, Y )[Y, Gt(X, Y )],

(7.7)

for small enough t.

Proof. Throughout the proof we abbreviate Vt(X, Y ), Ft(X, Y ), and Gt(X, Y ) to Vt, Ft and
Gt. Taking ∂t in the deﬁnition of Vt we get

∂Vt = −

which we know is valid. Working backwards we get the desired result. (To have invertibility
of ev(t)−1

v(t) we need kv(t)k < 2π which can be arranged for small enough t.)

For f ∈ A invertible and Z ∈ A we use the notation f · Z = f Zf−1.

Theorem 7.5. There exists ǫ > 0 such that for any given Banach algebra A there exist
continuous functions (X, Y ) 7→ R(X, Y ) ∈ A and (X, Y ) 7→ S(X, Y ) ∈ A deﬁned for kXk ≤ ǫ
and kY k ≤ ǫ such that R(0, 0) = S(0, 0) = 0,

V (eR(X,Y ) · X, eS(X,Y ) · Y ) = X + Y

for some R′, R′′, S′, and S′′. Moreover, if A is a C∗-algebra and X and Y are skewadjoints,
then R, R′, R′′, S, S′, and S′′ as above are all skewadjoints.

Proof. We will work in the setting of the free Banach algebra A(X, Y) and its Banach-Lie
subalgebra L(X, Y). We will construct Rt, St ∈ L(X, Y) for |t| ≤ ǫ such that R0 = S0 = 0
and

Vt(eRt · X, eSt · Y) = X + Y,

(7.9)

for all |t| ≤ ǫ. We will moreover show that λαRt = Rαt and λαSt = Sαt for all |α| ≤ 1. To
derive the theorem from this we will make the assignment ǫX 7→ X, ǫY 7→ Y and then deﬁne
R(X, Y ) = Rǫ( 1

ǫ Y ) and S(X, Y ) = Sǫ( 1

ǫ X, 1

ǫ X, 1

ǫ Y ).

Notice that (7.9) holds for t = 0 once R0 = S0 = 0. Thus, diﬀerentiating with respect to

t, (7.9) is equivalent to

∂tVt(Xt, Yt) + ∂X Vt(Xt, Yt)[∂teRte−Rt , Xt] + ∂Y Vt(Xt, Yt)[∂teSte−St, Yt] = 0,

(7.10)

with R0 = S0 = 0 (see [Rou14, pages 4–5]). Here we have set Xt = eRt · X and Yt = eSt · Y.

for suﬃciently small U . (Recall that Fn(X, Y) is a polynomial in X and Y; here F (X, Y) =

P∞n=1 Fn(X, Y) ∈ L[[X, Y]]). Furthemore, using the simple estimate kFn(X, T Y)k ≤ (1 +
kT k)nkFn(X, Y)k for any operator T acting on L(X, Y) we derive thatP∞n=1 |t|n−1kHn(U, V )k <

∞ for (U, V, t) in a suﬃciently small neighborhood of (0, 0, 0). It follows that H has uni-
formly bounded Frechet derivative for small enough t. The same can be said of the second
equation in (7.11). This guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a solution to (7.11) in
the Banach space L(X, Y) for |t| < ǫ and some ǫ > 0.

From (7.11) and the formula for the diﬀerential of the exponential map we deduce that

∂teRt = Ft(ertX, est Y)eRt ,
∂teSt = Gt(ertX, est Y)eSt .

(7.12)

With Rt and St that satisfy (7.12), equation (7.10) is equivalent to

∂tVt(Xt, Yt) + ∂X Vt(Xt, Yt)[Ft(Xt, Yt), Xt] + ∂Y Vt(Xt, Yt)[Gt(Xt, Yt), Yt] = 0.

But this is equation (7.7) from Lemma 7.4, where X and Y haven been replaced by Xt and
Yt. This proves (7.9).

Let 0 < α ≤ 1.

) is also a solution of
(7.11) (cf. [Rou14, page 7] for the same veriﬁcation for ft := eRt and gt := eSt). It follows
that λαRt = Rαt and λαSt = Sαt.

It is straightforward to check that (λαR t

Let us write Rt = a(t)X + b(t)Y +Pn≥2 Rt,n, with Rt,n ∈ Ln(X, Y). From λαRt = Rαt we

deduce that a(t) and b(t) are linear. But from (7.11) we see that ∂tRt|t=0 = Ft(X, Y)|t=0 = X

Thus, Rt = t X

To prove the theorem let us make the assignment ǫX 7→ X, ǫY 7→ Y , which, for kXk, kY k ≤
ǫ, extends to a Banach algebra contractive homomorphism from A(X, Y) to A. Then
R(X, Y ) = Rǫ( X

ǫ ) and S(X, Y ) = Sǫ( X

ǫ ) are as desired.

Finally, suppose that A is a C∗-algebra and that X and Y are skewadjoints. Since
σZ = −Z∗ is a continuous Lie algebra homomorphism and R(X, Y ) is a convergent se-
ries of Lie brackets on X, Y we get that σR(X, Y ) = R(σX, σY ) = R(X, Y ), i.e., R(X, Y ) is
skewadjoint. The same argument applies to S(X, Y ) and to R′, R′′, S′, S′′.
