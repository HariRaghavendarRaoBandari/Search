Abstract The solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) can be studied
in detail by examining long-term variations of the GCR energy spectrum (e.g.
on the scales of a solar cycle). With almost 20 years of data, the Electron Proton
Helium INstrument (EPHIN) onboard the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory
(SOHO) is well suited for this kind of investigation. Although the design of the
instrument is optimized to measure proton and helium isotope spectra up to 50
MeV nucleon−1, the capability exists to determine proton energy spectra from
250 MeV up to above 1.6 GeV. Therefore we developed a sophisticated inversion
method to calculate such proton spectra. The method relies on a GEANT4
Monte Carlo simulation of the instrument and a simpliﬁed spacecraft model
that calculates the energy-response function of EPHIN for electrons, protons
and heavier ions. For validation purposes, proton spectra based on this method
are compared to various balloon missions and space instrumentation. As a result
we present annual galactic cosmic ray spectra from 1995 to 2014.

1. Introduction

Hess (1912) discovered the evidence of a very penetrating radiation later called
cosmic rays, coming from outside the atmosphere. When Parker (1958) described
the solar wind, theoretical research of cosmic rays began, stimulated by the
beginning of in-situ space observations which have led to over four decades of
important space missions, including the Voyager, Ulysses, and – more recently

– the Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics
(PAMELA) and the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) missions. It is well
known that at energies below several GeV the cosmic-ray ﬂux is anti-correlated
with the 11-year and 22-year solar-activity cycle due to the solar modulation
(Heber and Potgieter, 2006; Heber, Fichtner, and Scherer, 2006). Thanks to
the Voyager mission, uncertainties about the modulation volume (i.e. the he-
liosphere) as well as the local interstellar spectrum (LIS), became small (Stone
et al., 2013). Thus the remaining main question to pose is: How do charged
particles propagate through the three-dimensional heliosphere and how do their
transport and propagation vary with the particles’ energy and the solar activity?
The transport of cosmic rays in the heliosphere can be described by Parker’s
transport equation (Parker, 1965). Physical processes that determine the mea-
sured ﬂux at 1 AU are: i) Outward convection caused by the radially directed
solar-wind velocity.; ii) Adiabatic deceleration or acceleration depending on the
sign of the divergence of the expanding solar wind.; and iii) Diﬀusion caused
by the irregular heliospheric magnetic ﬁeld. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient depends on
one’s position, on the particles’ rigidity (or energy), and on the solar activity
(time).; iv) Gradient and curvature drifts in the global heliospheric magnetic
ﬁeld, where the drift eﬀects depend not only on the particles’ rigidity and charge
but also on the phase of the 22-year solar-activity cycle, i.e. the orientation of
the solar magnetic ﬁeld above the solar poles (A > 0 or A < 0: Webber and
Lockwood, 1988).
At 1 AU the diﬀerent modulation processes manifest themselves in the shape
of the measured energy spectra, i.e. in the range above 100 MeV nucleon−1 to
below a few GeV nucleon−1 and its temporal variations (Potgieter, 2013). Thus,
in order to investigate these eﬀects in more detail, cosmic-ray energy spectra cov-
ering the above-mentioned energy range at all diﬀerent phases of the 22-year solar
magnetic cycle are required. Furthermore, the energy coverage of measurements
inside the Earth’s magnetosphere depends on the position of the observer, due to
the geomagnetic cutoﬀ. Thus an instrument in interplanetary space is preferred.
Since currently there is no dedicated instrumentation available, we extended the
measurement capabilities of the Electron Proton Helium INstrument (EPHIN)
onboard the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), which was launched
in 1995 and has been located at the Lagrangian point L1 since 1996.
After a brief synopsis of the method and an error analysis, the method is val-
idated in comparison to various other missions. Finally, annual proton spectra
from 1995 to 2014 are presented.

2. Instrumentation

A sketch of the EPHIN instrument (M¨uller-Mellin et al., 1995) is shown in Figure
1. The instrument consists of six silicon solid-state detectors surrounded by a
scintillator as anti-coincidence. For particles that deposit their entire energy in
the detector stack (“stopping particles”), the type of the particle measured can
be easily identiﬁed using the dE/dx − E method (M¨uller-Mellin et al., 1995).
However, this method is limited for protons to energies below 50 MeV. Above

that energy, protons penetrate through the instrument, depositing only a fraction
of their total kinetic energy. In order to overcome this limitation, a new method
previously only used during solar events (K¨uhl et al., 2015c) is adapted in such
way that GCR proton spectra in the energy range from 250 MeV up to 1.6 GeV
can be obtained.

3. Method

The method applied (for more details see K¨uhl et al., 2015b,c) relies on en-
ergy losses of particles that penetrate the entire instrument (e.g. detector A –
F are triggered, c.f. Figure 1). Sophisticated Geant4 Monte-Carlo simulations
(Agostinelli et al., 2003) have been performed for electrons, protons and helium
ions. In addition to particles entering the instrument at detector A and exiting at
detector F (“forward direction”), particles coming from behind the instrument
(entering at F, exiting at A; “backward direction”) are also considered. For the
latter, the shielding of the SOHO spacecraft is taken into account by placing a
10 cm Al layer behind the instrument. The simulation results are summarized in
Figure 2, where the simulated energy is presented as a function of the minimum
energy loss in either the C or D detector. While the energy loss of electrons (blue
triangles) is below ≈ 0.4 keV µm−1 independent of their energy, helium particles
(green circles) typically lose more than ≈ 1.5 keV µm−1 and hence intermediate-
energy losses are almost entirely caused by protons (red squares). Furthermore,
the relation between total kinetic energy and energy loss for forward protons can
be described by an analytical function ﬁtted to the simulation results. Using this
function, the total kinetic energy of a proton with a given measured energy loss
can be estimated. However, especially at lower energies, protons passing the in-
strument in the backward direction diﬀer signiﬁcantly from forward penetrating

particles. In addition, secondary protons can be created by backward directed
helium in the shielding (green diamonds).
In order to determine the energy range in which the method can be applied and
to estimate the systematic errors, further simulations using realistic proton and
helium spectra as simulation input have been performed. The force ﬁeld solution
(FFS: Gleeson and Axford, 1968; Usoskin, Bazilevskaya, and Kovaltsov, 2011)
approximates the GCR spectra at Earth for a given local interstellar spectrum
(LIS) and particle type as a function of a single variable, the modulation pa-
rameter [φ]. The solid lines in Figure 3 show FFS proton spectra for diﬀerent
φ, representing diﬀerent solar modulation conditions (e.g. φ=400 MV for solar
minimum, φ=1200 MV for solar maximum). Furthermore, Helium spectra with
the same φ and a energy independent He/p ratio of 25 % were included in the
simulation. The artiﬁcial data were then analyzed with the method described.
The resulting spectra are shown as symbols in Figure 3. In the lower panel, the
relative deviation between the resulting and the input spectra are presented.
Below 130 MeV (marked by dark-grey shading in the ﬁgure), high-energy he-
lium ions cause energy loss similar to that of low-energy protons and hence
the intensity is heavily overestimated (Figure 2, cf. K¨uhl et al., 2015b). In the
energy range between 130 and 250 MeV (light grey), the intensity is slightly
overestimated due to the inﬂuence of backward-directed protons (K¨uhl et al.,
2015c). Above 1.6 GeV (light grey), the energy loss of diﬀerent energies converges
and thus, without any further corrections, the errors increase. However, based
on the bottom panel of Figure 3, the systematic errors between 250 MeV and
1.6 GeV do not increase above 20 % for all solar modulation conditions.
The statistical errors are of the order of ≈ 10 %, 2 % and 0.5 % for a spectrum
of a given day, month and year respectively.

count rate of detector B / s−1

Figure 4. Example histograms of count rates of detector B for three selected months. The
dashed lines show the threshold for solar events.

In order to derive the GCR spectrum in a given time interval, solar events have
to be excluded from the data set as they feature higher ﬂuxes and a diﬀerent
spectral shape (Mewaldt et al., 2012). Therefore, we analyzed the count rate of
detector B (cf. Figure 1) without any coincidence condition, which is available
at one-minute resolution. The B-detector is sensitive to particles of low energy
(K¨uhl et al., 2015a) and hence the count rate is expected to rise during solar
events. In Figure 4, histograms of the detector B count rate are shown for
three diﬀerent months. All three histograms feature a sharp peak at count rates

SOLA: kuehl_et_al.tex; 3 March 2016; 1:49; p. 5

P. K¨uhl et al. 2015

between 50 and 170 counts per second. Those count rates are caused by the
GCR and the variation of the position of the peak can be explained by solar
modulation (K¨uhl et al., 2015a). In addition, the histograms for January 2001
and June 2005 show the occurrence of count rates above 170 counts per second
due to solar events. In our analysis, we have ﬁtted a Gaussian to the peak of
the count-rate distribution for every single month and excluded time periods, in
which the count rates in detector B rose above 3σ over the mean of the Gaussian
(dashed lines in Figure 4).
Following a similar approach to that used by K¨uhl et al. (2015c), Morgado
et al. (2015) have analyzed the response of the Electron, Proton and Alpha
Monitor (EPAM) onboard the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and the
Heliosphere Instrument for Spectra, Composition and Anisotropy at Low En-
ergies (HISCALE) onboard Ulysses to penetrating particles, focussing on the
possibility of detecting anisotropies and onset times of the May, 2012 GLE for
particles above 1 GeV. However, since those instrument do not have an integral
coincidence channel and thus a clearly deﬁned direction of arrival as well as data
of the energy loss in several detectors, the analysis of penetrating particles is
much more complicated and an energy spectrum for penetrating particles can
not be derived.

4. Results and Conclusion

In order to validate the derived spectra, Figure 5 shows data from various
balloon missions (Balloon-borne Experiment with Superconducting Spectrometer
(BESS): Shikaze et al., 2007, and BESS-Polar: Abe et al., 2015) as well as space-
borne instruments (AMS: Alcaraz et al., 2000, AMS-02: Aguilar et al., 2015,
and PAMELA: Adriani et al., 2013) in comparison to EPHIN spectra (black)
for the same time periods. The diﬀerent spectra are scaled in the interest of
greater clarity. The square sums of the statistical and the systematic error (20 %
independent of energy) of EPHIN are shown as an error band (grey). Note that
some BESS and BESS-Polar results are not shown, due to either gaps in EPHIN
data or solar energetic-particle events in the given time period, masking the
GCR spectra.
Based on this ﬁgure, EPHIN spectra are in good agreement with the other mea-
surements when taking into account the errors. Since the diﬀerent time periods
cover diﬀerent phases of the solar cycle, it can be concluded that the method
presented is valid for deriving spectra of galactic cosmic rays consistently.
Based on the method presented, annual GCR proton spectra from 1995 until
2014 have been derived. All annual spectra are available in the Appendix.
A selection of spectra at diﬀerent phases of the solar cycle is presented in Figure
6. While the two spectra at solar minimum (1997 and 2009) were obtained during
diﬀerent polarities (A > 0 and A < 0 respectively) the other two spectra (2005
and 2012) were obtained during the declining and rising phase of a A < 0
polarity phase (Hathaway, 2010). Especially the “record-high” spectrum of 2009
(Mewaldt et al., 2010) represents a particular challenge for models to explain. In
order to investigate the solar cycle dependence in more detail, Figure 7 displays

energy. This behaviour is expected based on Parker’s transport equation (Pot-
gieter, 2013). Note that similar to the neutron-monitor count rate, the intensity
variations show features of drift eﬀects such as the sharp peak in 2009 (A < 0)
in contrast to the ﬂatter maximum in 1997 (A > 0) (Webber and Lockwood,
1988).
Both ﬁgures show that the new data set allows us to investigate modulation
processes at energies below the one obtained by neutron monitors and above the
usual energy range from spacecraft instrumentation. Thus the two decades of
data available, together with the unique position of SOHO outside the Earth’s
magnetosphere, oﬀer the opportunity to validate solar-modulation model studies
(e.g. Potgieter et al., 2014).
