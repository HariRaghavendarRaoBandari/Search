Abstract.
In this paper, we review the preliminary results on the propagation eﬀects
and interplanetary consequences of fast and wide coronal mass ejection (CME) events,
occurred during 18–25 June 2015, in the Sun-Earth distance range. The interplanetary
scintillation (IPS) images reveal that the large-scale structures of CME-driven distur-
bances ﬁlled nearly the entire inner heliosphere with a range of speeds, ∼300–1000
kms−1. The comparison of speed data sets, from IPS technique results in the inner he-
liosphere and in-situ measurements at 1 AU, indicates that the drag force imposed by
the low-speed wind dominated heliosphere on the propagation of CMEs may not be
eﬀective. The arrival of shocks at 1 AU suggests that a shock can be driven in the inter-
planetary medium by the central part of the moving CME and also by a diﬀerent part
away from its centre. The increased ﬂux of proton at energies >10 MeV is consistent
with the acceleration of particles by the shock ahead of the CME.

Introduction – Coronal Mass Ejections during 18–25 June 2015

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) move outward from the Sun into the solar wind. Un-
derstanding the eﬀects of CMEs in the Sun-Earth distance and identiﬁcation of their
interacting shocks at the Earth’s magnetosphere are scientiﬁcally important as well as
essential for space weather perspectives. Numerous studies, including models, have
been made to investigate the propagation of CMEs in the inner heliosphere (e.g., Dryer
et al. (2004); Manoharan et al. (2001); Bisi et al. (2010)). In this study, we consider the
radial evolution of large CMEs occurred in the current solar cycle.

According to the sunspot observations, the current solar cycle #24 manifests to
be a less intense one in comparison with the previous recent cycles (in fact, this is the
smallest sunspot cycle since cycle #14, http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov). In
the course of the current cycle, however, several small and large sunspot groups have
produced moderately intense ﬂare/CME events. During June 2015, two groups of fairly
large ﬂare-active sunspots passed across the visible disk of the Sun: one in the southern
hemisphere (AR#2367, with a magnetic classiﬁcation of βγ) and the other in the north-
ern hemisphere (AR#2371, βγδ classiﬁcation). In this study, we consider the period,
18–25 June 2015, during which a number of ﬂares/CMEs and their related eruptions
from the above active regions propagated through the heliosphere. In particular, ﬁve
large CMEs were observed from the above active regions. In Table 1, we list the tim-

ings and locations of these ﬁve CME events, along with the available speeds of type-II
radio bursts. Four of them were fast halo CMEs (i.e., VCME >1000 kms−1) and were as-
sociated with M-class ﬂares at AR#2371. The second event in the list originated from
AR#2367 at S21W27 and propelled a partial halo CME of width >150 degrees, at a
nominal speed of ∼300 kms−1.

A major geomagnetic storm (Dst = -204 nT for a prolonged period on 23 June
2015; http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp) was caused by the fast CME event on 21
June 2015 (Table 1, event #3), which was associated with an M2.6 ﬂare from AR#2371
at N12E13. The white-light images of the above CME event, obtained from the LASCO
C2/C3 coronagraphs Brueckner et al. (1995), are displayed in Figure 1. The fast ex-
panding full halo structure, along with the ﬁlament moving in the north-east direction,
can evidently be observed in these images. Since the originating location of the CME
event was to the east of the central meridian of the Sun, the direction of propagation
of the CME (also its expansion) was oriented to the east with respect to the Sun-Earth
line. The LASCO images typically cover up to a heliocentric distance of about 30 solar
radii (R⊙) (1 AU ≈ 215 R⊙). The interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations have
been employed in tracking the consequences of propagation of CMEs farther into the

1.1.

Interplanetary Scintillation Images

The IPS observation from a radio source can provide estimates of solar wind speed and
normalized scintillation index (g-index, which is directly related to the level of den-
sity turbulence in the solar wind, i.e., ∆Ne) at the closest solar approach of the line of
sight to the radio source (e.g., Manoharan (1993); Manoharan et al. (2000)). The IPS
measurements at the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT) on a grid of a large number of radio
sources allow to image the disturbances associated with the CMEs at diﬀerent distances
from the Sun before their arrival at the near-Earth space (for details on Ooty IPS studies
refer to Manoharan et al. (2000); Manoharan (2010); Bisi et al. (2010)). The images
of normalized scintillation index (g-maps) obtained from the Ooty measurements be-
tween 19 and 26 June 2015 are displayed in Figure 2. These images are the sky-plane
projection of the inner heliosphere, as viewed from the Earth and the vertical (top to
bottom) and horizontal (left to right) directions, respectively, represent north-south and
east-west directions of the heliosphere. In these images, the observing time increases
from right to left (i.e., from west of the Sun to east). Thus, each image shows the three-
dimensional distribution of ∆Ne on a given day around the Sun, over a heliospheric
diameter of ∼2 AU. For example, a g-value close to unity, g ≈ 1, corresponds to the
condition of the ambient solar wind and values of g > 1 and g < 1 represent, respec-
tively, enhancement and depletion in levels of density turbulence (i.e., ∆Ne) in the solar
wind. The large-scale structures of enhanced scintillation seen in these images show the
presence of CME-associated disturbances in the interplanetary medium. The outward

displacement from the centre of the heliosphere and increase in size of these structures
with time suggest the typical speed of propagation and interplanetary consequences of
the CMEs.

In this period of study, 18–25 June 2015, the Sun was not dominated by mid-
latitude coronal hole(s) and the contribution from the interaction of fast-slow solar wind
streams was expected to be insigniﬁcant (in general, the eﬀects of such interactions are
observed at distances larger than 1 AU (e.g., Gosling (1996))). Therefore, the IPS
images shown in Figure 2 reveal the consequences of CMEs related disturbances in
the interplanetary medium. On all these days, the inner heliosphere was ﬁlled with the
CME-associated disturbances of a high level of density turbulence.

2. Speed Distribution of CME-driven Disturbances

Some of the disturbances seen in the IPS images were produced by the fast halo CMEs
and they moved with speeds higher than that of the speed of the ambient solar wind.
Solar wind speed estimates obtained from Ooty IPS observations between 19 and 27
June 2015 are plotted in Figure 3. These plots include speed data from sources for
which the observed g-values are well above the ambient level (i.e., g ≥ 2) and conﬁrm
speeds associated with the CME disturbances.
It is to be mentioned that since IPS
technique probes diﬀerent parts of the heliosphere, the above plots would include speed
measurements from various parts of the CME-driven disturbances. Moreover, since we
are interested in understanding the eﬀects of propagation of the CMEs with distance
from the Sun, we compare the speeds of solar wind at two heliocentric distance ranges,
respectively, ≤125 R⊙ and >125 R⊙. It is evident in these plots that during the passage
of CMEs, the interplanetary medium is ﬁlled with a range of speeds, ∼300–1000 kms−1.
During this period, as indicated by the IPS observations as well as in-situ measurements
at 1 AU (refer to Figures 4 and 5), the speed of the ambient (i.e., background) solar
wind varies in the range of ∼275–375 kms−1. The drag applied by the background
solar wind (i.e., the interaction of the CME with the ambient ﬂow) is proportional to
|VCME − VAMBIENT|2. Therefore, in the current situation (i.e., low-speed dominated
background solar wind) the CMEs would likely be slowed down. However, as seen in
the above plots, the evolution of high-speed wind (i.e., >500 kms−1) between these two
regions of the inner heliosphere (i.e., with respect to the midway between the Sun and
Earth) is not signiﬁcant. A similar speed distribution is observed at both the distance
ranges.

Interplanetary Magnetic Field and Plasma Parameters

2.1.
It is to be noted that the CMEs seen in the IPS ﬁeld of view were not earthward directed
(Figure 2 and refer to Table 1) and thus the centre part of the CMEs would not have
been expected to hit the Earth and cause eﬀects at the near-Earth space. However, in
this period of the study, six interplanetary shocks were recorded in the in-situ data sets
observed at the near-Earth orbit and two geomagnetic storms (i.e., an intense storm, Dst
= -204 nT and the other of moderate strength storm, Dst = -86 nT) were observed by
the geomagnetic observatories. Figure 4 shows the interplanetary plasma and magnetic
ﬁeld parameters of the ambient solar wind and CME-driven shock disturbances ob-
served at 1 AU. These data sets have been obtained from the OMNIWeb Plus Interface
(http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov). Figure 4 shows from top to bottom (i) average

perature, TP, and (v) proton ﬂux at energy >10 MeV. These plots have been made using
5-min averaged data sets. Figure 4 also includes the plot of hourly Dst value, which
denotes the intensity of the geomagnetic storm. This ﬁgure illustrates the conditions of
the solar wind prior to the shocks (i.e., unshocked ambient solar wind), shocked plasma
and the conditions of driver gas associated with the CMEs. The arrival of six shocks are
indicated by dashed vertical lines. The CME behind the shock #3 revealed a ﬂux-rope
like structure in the plasma and magnetic ﬁeld data. The proton ﬂux plotted in Figure
4 shows increase in ﬂux between ∼21 and 28 June 2015. It is likely that the above
CME-driven shocks in the Sun-Earth space have supported the acceleration of particles
to high energies.

Since the IPS observations allow to probe the properties of the solar wind in three-
dimensional space, the preliminary results of Ooty IPS tomographic reconstruction sug-
gest that (i) CME events #3 and #4 were nearly Earth directed and the earlier one caused
an intense shock as well as a major storm of intensity Dst = -204 nT at the Earth (refer
to shock #3 in Figure 4); (ii) for other events listed in Table 1, only the tail part of the
CME crossed the Earth (i.e., just a glancing blow at the Earth’s magnetosphere) and
caused shocks of considerable strength, but not the intense storms. The reconstruction
also shows that some of the CMEs move intact and retain their loop-like shape even
at large solar distances, suggesting that the magnetic energy associated with a CME is
important in determining its radial evolution. Given the limitation of space in this book,
a detailed paper on the study of IPS tomographic reconstruction of these CME events
will be published elsewhere.

In Figure 4, it is to be noted that during 22–26 June 2015 (i.e., day numbers 173 to
178), the solar wind speed at 1 AU remains at a high level, which is well above the am-
bient speed. When we examine the speed distribution, obtained from the in-situ data at
1 AU, it shows that a signiﬁcant fraction of data points is in the high speed range >500
kms−1. Figure 5 (left panel) shows the histogram of solar wind speed data obtained
from the in-situ measurements for the period 19–27 June 2015. It is to be mentioned

that this plot includes speeds from the ambient solar wind and CME-associated distur-
bances. Since not all CME-driven disturbances are Earth directed, this plot includes
propagation characteristics of the nearly central part of the CME crossing the Earth as
well as the eﬀects of the east or the west wings of the CMEs. As stated earlier, the plots

plots include ambient solar wind conditions as well as disturbances caused by the
CMEs at the near-Earth space.

made from the IPS observations would include speed data from various parts of the
propagating CME-driven disturbances. The speed of the ambient (i.e., background) so-
lar wind seems to be low at below 350 kms−1, whereas the speed distribution associated
with the CME-driven disturbances lies much above the background ﬂow. At ∼1 AU,
the drag caused by the ambient solar wind has not been eﬃcient enough to slow down
the CME disturbances. It is consistent with the range of speeds obtained from the IPS
technique, which gives an overall view of the propagating structures and a signiﬁcant
fraction of them travel at high speeds.

The above inferred solar wind conditions, observed during 19–27 June 2015, have
been compared with the largest storm period of the nearly similar phase of the previous
cycle, i.e., 28 October – 05 November 2003 (Halloween solar events period). The
right panel of Figure 5 shows the histogram of solar wind speed data from the in-situ
measurements. In this plot, the striking feature is that the background solar wind speed
is above ∼350 kms−1 and is diﬀerent from the low-speed dominated heliosphere of the
current cycle. In spite of the low background speed, in the period 19–27 June 2015,
the CME-driven disturbances continue to travel at speeds above 500 kms−1. Whereas
in the Halloween period, most of the CMEs originated with rather high speeds (i.e.,
∼1000–2000 kms−1) and they signiﬁcantly evolved in the Sun-Earth distance.

3. Summary

The interplanetary consequences of CME events occurred during 18–25 June 2015 have
been analysed based on the white-light images in the near-Sun region, IPS images cov-
ering a heliocentric distance range of 50–200 R⊙, and in-situ measurements at 1 AU.
During this period, the inner heliosphere was ﬁlled with CME-driven disturbances of a
high level of density turbulence (∆Ne) and their speeds covered a wide range, ∼300–
1000 kms−1. Moreover, at this phase of the cycle, the heliosphere was dominated
by low-speed ambient ﬂows (∼275–375 kms−1), which likely did not slow down the
CMEs. The solar wind speed distributions at two distances (i.e., ≤125 R⊙ and >125

R⊙) as well as at 1 AU are consistent with the less radial evolution of speed. The loop-
like structures seen in some of the CMEs maintain their shape even at large distances
from the Sun and it indicates the importance of magnetic and/or internal energy within
a CME in controlling the radial evolution (e.g., Manoharan (2010); Manoharan & Mu-
jiber Rahman (2011)). Since the eﬀective radial evolution can vary from one CME to
the other, it is essential that not only the drag eﬀected by the background ﬂows, but also
the internal energy of a CME and its rate of dissipation in the interplanetary medium
are required to be considered in understanding the radial evolution of the CME.
