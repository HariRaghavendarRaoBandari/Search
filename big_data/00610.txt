Hercules and Wolf 630 Stellar Streams and Galactic Bar Kinematics

V.V. Bobylev and A.T. Bajkova

Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory, St. Petersburg, Russia

Abstract—We have identiﬁed the four most signiﬁcant features in the UV velocity
distribution of solar neighborhood stars: H1, H2 in the Hercules stream and W1, W2 in the
Wolf 630 stream. We have formulated the problem of determining several characteristics
of the central Galactic bar independently from each of the identiﬁed features by assuming
that the Hercules and Wolf 630 streams are of a bar-induced dynamical nature. The
problem has been solved by constructing 2 : 1 resonant orbits in the rotating bar frame
for each star in these streams. Analysis of the resonant orbits found has shown that
the bar pattern speed is 45–55 km s−1 kpc−1, while the bar angle lies within the range
40◦ − 60◦. The results obtained are consistent with the view that the Hercules and Wolf
630 streams could be formed by a long-term inﬂuence of the Galactic bar leading to a
characteristic bimodal splitting of the UV velocity plane.

INTRODUCTION

Analysis of the velocity ﬁeld of solar-neighborhood stars using Hipparcos (1997) data
(Chereul et al. 1998; Dehnen 1998; Asiain et al. 1999; Skuljan et al. 1999) and based
on the most recent data (Famaey et al. 2005; Bobylev and Bajkova 2007; Antoja et
al. 2008; Bobylev et al. 2010) has revealed a well-developed ﬁne structure. Various
nonaxisymmetric Galactic potential models,
in particular, the spiral pattern and the
Galactic bar, are considered to explain several structures to which quite old stars belong.
As simulations showed, the existence of the Hercules stream can be explained by the
fact that its stars have resonant orbits induced by the Galactic bar (Dehnen 1999, 2000;
Fux 2001; Chakrabarty 2007). A detailed analysis of the kinematics of nearby F and G
dwarfs using high-resolution spectra (Bensby et al. 2007) showed the stars in the stream
to have a wide range of stellar ages, metallicities, and elemental abundances, and this
led to the conclusion that the dynamical eﬀect of the Galactic bar is the most acceptable
explanation for the existence of the Hercules stream.

On the whole, the Galactic evolution simulations performed with various Galactic
potential models and central bar models conﬁrm the hypothesis about a dynamical origin
for some of the streams observed in the solar neighborhood, in particular, the Hercules
stream (Gardner and Flinn 2010; Bovy 2010). The point is that the central bar in our
Galaxy can be represented not as a singular one. At least, there can be two of them:
one is long and the other is short; they are oriented at diﬀerent angles with respect to
the direction toward the Sun and can rotate with diﬀerent pattern speeds. All of this
makes a detailed reproduction of the observed stellar velocity distribution in the solar
neighborhood diﬃcult.

1

On the other hand, Antoja et al. (2009) showed that some of the dynamical stellar
streams in the solar neighborhood, such as the Hercules stream, could be due to the
existence of dynamical resonances with the Galactic spiral structure and not exclusively
to the inﬂuence of the Galactic bar. As several authors showed, the inﬂuence of spiral
structure leads to a splitting of the UV velocity plane and the emergence of clumpiness
(De Simone et al. 2004; Quillen and Minchev 2005), but it cannot completely explain the
global asymmetry (the U–anomaly problem, the distribution bimodality) in the observed
UV velocity distribution.

In addition to the Hercules stream, there are also other features on the UV velocity
plane, in particular, the Wolf 630 stream (Bobylev et al. 2010), with some of the authors
designating this place as the α Ceti stream (Francis and Anderson 2009). The interest is
that there are orbits both elongated along the bar major axis and oriented perpendicularly
to it in the bar reference frame. At present, there is reason to believe that the Sun is
near the point of intersection of such orbits (Fig. 1 in Dehnen (2000)). In this case, the
bimodality of the UV velocity distribution can be explained by the fact that there are
representatives of these two orbit families in the solar neighborhood. According to Dehnen
(2000), the detailed form of the velocity distribution depends strongly on the position of
the Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR). In particular, there will be no bimodality if the
OLR is farther from the Galactic center than the solar cycle (ROLR/R0 > 1.05, Fig. 4 in
Dehnen (2000)).

According to the coordinates on the UV velocity plane, the Hercules stream is a
representative of the family of orbits oriented perpendicularly to the bar major axis,
while the representatives of the family of orbits elongated along the bar major axis are
located in the region on the UV velocity plane where the Wolf 630 stream is observed.

Note that both the relic of an open cluster and the stars that appeared here due to
resonances or other dynamical eﬀects can be simultaneously present in the clump on the
UV velocity plane. Such a situation is observed in the region of the Hyades stream, where
there are stars of the well-known open cluster, but stars with resonant orbits constitute
the bulk of the stream (Pompeia et al. 2011). When studying the Wolf 630 stream based
on the list of Eggen (1969), Bubar and King (2010) found 19 stars with an exceptional
homogeneity among 34 candidates: [Fe/H]=−0.01 ± 0.02 at a mean age of 2.7 ± 0.5 Gyr.
This argues for the hypothesis about the relic of an open cluster or a dwarf galaxy. On
the other hand, using ∼200 stars of the Wolf 630 stream, Bobylev et al. (2010) showed
its inhomogeneity: [Fe/H]≈ −0.1 ± 0.2 at a mean age of ∼ 4 ± 2.5 Gyr.

The goal of this paper is to estimate such characteristics of the bar as its pattern speed
Ωbar and orientation θbar under the assumption that the Hercules and Wolf 630 streams
could be formed by a single mechanism associated with the inﬂuence of the Galactic bar.
We solve the problem by constructing 2 : 1 resonant orbits of individual stars forming
these streams in the rotating bar frame and by analyzing the Galactic rotation curve.
The characteristics of each of the streams are determined independently, i.e., we do not
assume them to be of common origin in advance.

THE U V VELOCITIES OF THE STREAMS

The wavelet map of the UV velocity distribution for single stars with reliable distance
estimates from Bobylev et al. (2010) is presented in Fig. 1. The map was constructed
using ∼17000 stars from the Hipparcos catalogue (1997). We took their proper motions
and parallaxes from a revised version of this catalogue (van Leeuwen 2007) and their
radial velocities from the OSACA catalogue of radial velocities (Bobylev et al. 2006) and
the Pulkovo compilation of radial velocities (PCRV) (Gontcharov 2006). For all these
stars, the relative error in the parallax does not exceed 10%.

The contour lines in Fig. 1 are given on a logarithmic scale: 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 90%,
and 99%. The velocities are given relative to the Sun. This ﬁgure indicates the W1
and W2 features for the Wolf 630 stream and the H1 and H2 features for the Hercules
stream with the following coordinates of their centers: W1 (U, V ) = (21, −26) km s−1,
W2 (U, V ) = (40, −24) km s−1, H1 (U, V ) = (−33, −51) km s−1, H2 (U, V ) = (−71, −48)
km s−1. According to this map, we selected the speciﬁc stars belonging to these features
based on the probabilistic method. The number of probable candidates in each stream
was the following: 250, 271, 401, and 218 stars in W1, W2, H1, and H2, respectively.

When constructing the Galactic orbits to determine the stellar velocities relative
to the local standard of rest (LSR), we use the peculiar solar velocity components
relative to the LSR with their values from Sch¨onrich et al.
(2010), (U⊙, V⊙, W⊙) =
(11.1, 12.2, 7.3) ± (0.7, 0.5, 0.4) km s−1. When these velocities were determined, the stellar
metallicity gradient in the Galactic disk and the eﬀect of radial mixing of stars in the
disk were taken into account and modeled. Therefore, the values of these components are
currently the most plausible ones and are widely used by various authors.

METHODS

Orbit Construction

We construct the orbits by solving the following system of equations of motion based on
a realistic Galactic gravitational potential (Fern´andez et al. 2008):

∂ξ − Ω2
+ Ω2

⊙(R⊙ − ξ) − 2Ω⊙ ˙η,
⊙η + 2Ω⊙ ˙ξ,

¨ξ = −∂Φ
¨η = −∂Φ
∂η
¨ζ = −∂Φ
∂ζ

,

(1)

where Φ is the Galactic gravitational potential; the coordinate system (ξ, η, ζ) centered
on the Sun rotates around the Galactic center with a constant angular velocity Ω⊙, with
the ξ axis being directed to the Galactic center, the η axis pointing in the direction of
Galactic rotation, and the ζ axis being directed toward the north Galactic pole; R⊙ is
the Galactocentric distance of the Sun. When the Galactic potential Φ is known, the
system of equations (1) can be solved numerically. We used a fourth-order Runge–Kutta
integrator.

In the model of Allen and Santill´an (1991), the Galactocentric distance of the Sun
is taken to be R⊙ = 8.5 kpc, while the circular velocity of the Sun around the Galactic
center is V⊙ = Ω⊙R⊙ = 220 km s−1. The Galactic potential considered here consists of
an axisymmetric component and a bar potential:

Φ = Φo + Φb.

(2)

In turn, the axisymmetric component can be represented as the sum of three components
— central (bulge), disk, and halo ones:

Φo = ΦC + ΦD + ΦH .

(3)

The central component of the Galactic potential in cylindrical coordinates (r, z, θ) is rep-
resented as

where MC is the mass, bC is the scale length, and r2 = x2 + y2. The disk component is

Here, MH is the mass, aH is the scale length, and R2 = x2 + y2 + z2. The triaxial ellipsoid
model (Palou˘s et al. 1993) was chosen as the potential due to the central bar:

Φb =

where x = R cos ϑ, y = R sin ϑ, ab, bb, cb are the three bar semiaxes, qb is the bar length;
ϑ = θ − Ωbart − θbar, θ = η/R⊙ − ξ (Ωbar is the bar pattern speed, t is the integration
time, θbar is the bar angle relative to the Galactic X and Y axes).

If R is measured in kpc, MC, MD, MH, Mb are in units of the Galactic mass (MG) equal
to 2.32 × 107M⊙, then the gravitational constant G = 1 and 100 km2 s−2 is the unit of
measurement of the potential Φ and its individual components (4)–(7). The parameters
of the model potential from Allen and Santill´an (1991) and the bar potential adopted here
are given in Table 1.

We pass from the moving coordinate system (ξ, η, ζ) to the Galactic one (X, Y, Z)

using the formulas

X = (R⊙ − ξ) cos(tΩ⊙) − η sin(tΩ⊙),
Y = (R⊙ − ξ) sin(tΩ⊙) + η cos(tΩ⊙),
Z = ζ.

(8)

In the case of integration by the Runge–Kutta method, it should be kept in mind that
t = 0.001/1.023 corresponds to one million years at the distance and mass measurements
adopted above. The orbit integration time was chosen to be 4 Gyr, given that the char-
acteristic lifetime of the bar (from the beginning of its formation to its destruction) is
typically 2–4 Gyr. Note that allowance for the interaction with other galaxies would be
required on long integration time scales.

Searching for Periodic Orbits

This section is devoted to searching for resonant periodic orbits in an axisymmetric po-
tential in a rotating frame lying in the Galactic plane centered at the Galactic center.

5

Note that the objects execute a three-dimensional motion in accordance with Eqs.
(3)–(6) for the potential. However, since the bar rotates around the Galactic center in
the (X, Y ) plane and since resonant orbits are searched for precisely in the bar rotation
frame, we search for periodic orbits in the (Xp, Y p) plane (Fux 2001). We pass from
the moving coordinate system (ξ, η) to the coordinate system (Xp, Yp) rotating with the
pattern speed Ωp using formulas similar to Eqs. (8):

Xp = (R⊙ − ξ) cos(t(Ω⊙ − Ωp)) − η sin(t(Ω⊙ − Ωp)),
Yp = (R⊙ − ξ) sin(t(Ω⊙ − Ωp)) + η cos(t(Ω⊙ − Ωp)).

(9)

In this paper, as the rotating frame we consider the bar whose pattern speed and orienta-
tion we attempt to estimate by constructing the resonant periodic orbits of stars from the
Hercules and Wolf 630 streams in the bar frame. This requires ﬁnding the periodic orbits
that satisfy the (2 : 1) resonance (Fux 2001; Orlov and Sotnikova 2007). The condition
for a resonance in the stellar disk plane is the commensurability of two frequencies: the
angular velocity Ω and the epicyclic frequency κ:

lκ = m(Ω − Ωp),

(10)

with integers m ≥ 0 and l. In the rotating frame, the m/l resonant orbit is closed after
m radial oscillations and |l| orbital periods. Note that condition (10) coincides with the
condition for Lindblad resonances only at l = ±1. The outside corotation, l < 0, is
negative, and we can talk about the outer m/|l| resonances. In this paper, we discuss
only the outer resonances. Figure 4 from Fux (2001) presents such orbits at |l| = 1. If
m = 2 and l = −1, corresponding to (2 : 1) resonant orbits, then it follows from Eq. (10)
that

Ωp = Ω + κ/2.

(11)

The ideology of the proposed method is that we seek for the bar pattern speed Ωp (it is
diﬀerent for diﬀerent stars) at which the orbit becomes resonant and, hence, periodic (in
the case of an axisymmetric potential) and quasi-periodic (in the case of a nonaxisymmet-
ric potential, for example, when the bar is included, see below). We propose the following
numerical algorithm of seeking for such a pattern speed Ωp lying within the range [Ω1, Ω2]
predetermined empirically:

(1) For a given frequency range, we specify a grid of discrete frequencies Ω1 +
m∆Ω, m = 0, ..., M, where ∆Ω = (Ω2 − Ω1)/M, M is an integer large enough to ob-
tain the required dense grid of frequencies. Experience shows that an acceptable accuracy
of the algorithm is achieved at ∆Ω = 0.01 km s−1 kpc−1.

(2) We integrate the stellar orbit in the coordinate system (ξ, η) for a suﬃciently long

time (several billion years or tens of revolutions around the Galactic center).

(3) We pass to the coordinate system (Xp, Yp) by successively substituting all of the

frequencies from the grid speciﬁed above into Eq. (9) as Ωp.

(4) We superimpose a discrete grid on the (Xp, Yp) plane with the same step ∆x =
∆y = ∆ in the X and Y directions that is chosen empirically to be small enough to
provide the required orbit reproduction accuracy. The product ∆ × N, where N is the
maximum number of cells in both X and Y directions, gives the linear size of the (Xp, Yp)

6

In our case, this size at N = 512 and the discretization step ∆ = 46.875 pc is

24 kpc.

(5) On the discrete N × N (Xp, Yp) plane, we assign “1” to the coordinates of the cell
through which the orbit passes and “0” to all the remaining discrete coordinates. If the
orbit crosses a given cell several times, then we anyway assign “1” to the corresponding
point on the plane only once.

(6) For all maps, we count the number of ones K. The map with the smallest number
of ones corresponds to the orbit with a resonance frequency Ω1 + i∆Ω, where i is the map
number.

(7) For the orbit found, we additionally check whether it belongs to a certain type of

resonant orbits (corotation, 1 : 1, 2 : 1, etc.).

Stable periodic orbits give a ﬁlling in the form of a trajectory whose shape does not
change with increasing number of revolutions around the Galactic center. If several stable
periodic orbits fall within a given frequency range, then the algorithm chooses the orbit
with the smallest ﬁlling to which the orbit with the smallest multiplicity of resonance
frequencies corresponds.
If the orbit is not stable, then it progressively densely ﬁlls a
certain space on the (Xp, Yp) coordinate plane with increasing integration time or number
of revolutions around the Galactic center, i.e., the number K increases noticeably. Thus,
the change in K with integration time serves as a measure of orbit stability. Obviously,
the number K depends on the map cell size, so that the numbers for a given object
at diﬀerent frequencies from the frequency range [Ω1, Ω2] must be compared for discrete
maps with the same discretization step.

Once the periodic orbits in the axisymmetric potential (3) had been found, we checked
how much the resonance frequencies changed when the bar was included. For this purpose,
in the vicinity of the resonance frequency found, we reﬁned its value using the algorithm
described above by taking into account the fact that the bar pattern speed and angle are
the parameters that enter into the expression for the bar potential in accordance with
Eq. (7). As the bar angle we used the estimate obtained for the axisymmetric poten-
tial. It turned out that including the bar changed the resonance frequency, on average,
by 0.4%. For example, for one of the stars from the Hercules stream with coordinates
(x, y, z, U, V, W ) = (0.041, −0.031, −0.128, −42.75, −56, 70, −6.26) (the positions in kpc,
the velocities in km s−1), the resonance frequency was found to be 52.74 and 52.91 km s−1
kpc−1 in the case of the axisymmetric potential and with the inclusion of the bar potential,
respectively. The orbits found for this star are shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen from this
ﬁgure, the orbits in the rotating bar frame obtained in these two cases diﬀer visually, but
not much. This is because the gravitational contribution of the bar to the total Galactic
potential is small (Fern´andez et al. 2008). At the same time, however, the orbit acquires
the property of stochasticity. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the orbit under the inﬂuence
of the bar (right panel) becomes more blurred (because it undergoes libration near the
resonance) than the periodic resonant orbit obtained in the axisymmetric potential (left
panel). Thus, the orbit becomes quasi-periodic under the inﬂuence of the bar. As our
integration showed, the ﬁlling of the plane in the second case slowly but expands with
increasing integration time. For example, the number of ones K in the (Xp, Yp) coordinate
plane, in our case of size 512 × 512, evolves as follows: K = 838, 1398, 1916, and 2378 at
the integration time T = 1100, 2200, 3300, and 4400 Myr, respectively.

Figure 2: Example of orbit integration in a coordinate system rotating with the bar
pattern speed in the axisymmetric potential (a) and with the addition of the bar potential
(b); the Galactic center lies at the coordinate origin; the Sun’s coordinates are (X, Y ) =
(8.5, 0) kpc.

As a result, it turned out that when the bar was included, the resonance frequencies
changed by a negligibly small value, while the shape and orientation of orbits in the bar
frame did not change. Thus, we showed that to solve our problem of determining the bar
pattern speed and orientation, it would suﬃce to study the periodic orbits obtained in
the axisymmetric potential. This is important, because the bar potential is not known
with certainty; there are a multitude of its models in the literature. We only know that
its gravitational contribution to the total Galactic potential is small.

The inﬂuence of the bar was studied in detail using simulations by Fux (2001). We
do not set such a goal in this paper. We need to solve the inverse problem: to estimate
the parameters of the bar by assuming that the features of the Hercules and Wolf 630
streams are produced by its long-term dynamical eﬀect.

The bar orientation in the Galactic (X, Y ) plane can be determined from the orienta-
tion of orbits in the (Xp, Yp) plane. Indeed, while in the axisymmetric case the orientation
of the resonant orbits is arbitrary, the virtual introduction of a bar will retain only those
orbits which are reﬂection-symmetric with respect to at least one of the bar principal axes
(Fux 2001).

RESULTS

Using the above-described method of searching for periodic orbits in an axisymmetric
potential for each star of the identiﬁed H1, H2, W1, and W2 features, we found the
resonance frequencies Ωc, Ω1:1 and Ω2:1. The interval of integration was 4 Gyr.

The corresponding histograms, i.e., the distributions of the number of stars N as a
function of the resonance frequency, are presented in Fig. 3. The histograms occupying
the left, right, and central parts of the graph refer to the corotation, 1:1, and 2:1 reso-

nance frequencies, respectively. We associate the bar pattern speed below denoted by Ωbar
with the 2:1 resonance frequency. The individual distributions are seen to be Gaussian.
The 1:1 resonant and corotation resonant orbits exhibit the largest and smallest disper-
sions, respectively. The 2:1 resonant orbits, in accordance with Eq. (10), are intermediate
between them.

Figure 4 presents the families of orbits in a coordinate system rotating with the bar
pattern speed. The orbits of stars in the H1 and H2 streams are elongated perpendicularly
to the bar major axis, while the orbits of stars in the W1 and W2 streams are elongated
along the bar. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the bar angle θbar lies within the range
40◦ − 60◦. Thus, the bar angle is determined by the inclination of the orbital major axis,
as shown in Fig. 4 (upper right panel). In accordance with the central limit theorem, we
assume that the deviations of the orbital inclinations of stars from the samples considered
obey a normal law. The bar angle for each sample was calculated as the mean of the
orbital inclinations of stars from the samples; the error in the angle was calculated as the
root–mean–square deviation from the mean.

The quantitative estimates of Ωbar and θbar found from the results presented in Figs.
3 and 4 are given in Table 2. As can be seen from the table, the bar pattern speed Ωbar
and the bar angle θbar determined from the pair of W2 and H1 have larger discrepancies
between themselves than those from the pair of W1 and H2.

Let us show that our estimates are robust when using the various Galactic rotation
curves constructed with the constant R0 whose values lie within a fairly wide range, from
7.5 to 8.5 kpc.

It can be seen from Fig. 5a that curves 1 and 2 have signiﬁcant diﬀerences only at
R < 2.5 kpc, which is not critical for our goals. Curve 2 has an analytical representation,
which allows the dependences k(R) = 2Ω(1 + 1/2 · R/Ω · dΩ/dR)1/2, Ω + k/2, Ω − k/2,
and Ω + k shown in Fig. 5 to be calculated. The vertical dotted line in Fig. 5a marks the
distance R0 = 8.5 kpc, the thin vertical line indicates the radius of the outer Lindblad
resonance (OLR) ROLR = 7.9 kpc (we found ROLR = 0.93R0 based on the data in Fig. 3
from the mean of the four corresponding frequencies), the three resonances of interest to
us are marked: the corotation, (2:1), and (1:1) ones. According to present-day estimates,
the exact value of R0 lies within the range 7.1–8.5 kpc (see, e.g., Table 1 from Foster and
Cooper (2010)). Therefore, it is of interest to trace whether the positions of the resonances
change with R0. Figure 5b provides the rotation curve constructed directly from the data
of Bobylev et al. (2008) at R0 = 7.5 kpc. As can be seen from Fig. 5, when R0 decreases
by 1 kpc, the resonance frequencies remain almost unchanged at ROLR = 0.93R0. As we
see from the graphs, the bar pattern speed corresponding to the 2:1 resonance frequency
is about 52 km s−1 kpc, consistent with the results that we have obtained above by an
independent method.

DISCUSSION

Let us ﬁrst discuss some of the known bar characteristics. Table 3 gives the estimates of
the bar pattern speed, size, and orientation obtained by diﬀerent authors using diﬀerent

Binney et al. (1991) and Bissantz et al. (2003) estimated the parameters by comparing

the radio observations of central Galactic regions (HI, CO) with various bar models.

Debattista et al. (2002) estimated the bar pattern speed from radio observations of 250
OH/IR stars. These are oxygen-rich stars with envelopes at the asymptotic-giant-branch
phase with strong mass loss. The observations yielded ∆V ≡ ΩbarR0−VLSR = 252±41 km
s−1, while Ωbar was calculated at R0 = 8 kpc and VLSR = 220 km s−1. Thus, this is a rare
example of a direct measurement of the bar pattern speed. The same stars were also used
in Sevenster et al. (1999).

Benjamin et al. (2005) estimated the size and orientation of the long bar by analyz-
ing the star counts based on the GLIMPSE (Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey
Extraordinaire) infrared survey produced on the basis of observations with the Spitzer
Space Telescope. For these purposes, Groenewegen and Blommaert (2007) used Mira
variables from the OGLE-II survey (Wozniak et al. 2002), designed to search for mi-
crolensing eﬀects. The arguments for the hypothesis of a long bar were also presented by
L´opez-Corredoira et al. (2007). Shortly afterwards, based on the counts of stars from the
2MASS catalog, this group of authors (Cabrera-Lavers et al. 2007) proposed a two-bar
model.

13

A similar method of star counts was applied using red-giant-clump stars from the
CIRSI (Cambridge InfraRed Survey Instrument) survey by Babusiaux and Gilmore
(2005), from the 2MASS catalog by L´opez-Corredoira et al. (2005), and from the OGLE-
II survey by Rattenbury et al. (2007). Robin et al. (2003) extracted information about
the bar size and orientation by analyzing the data from the Hipparcos catalogue (1997).
Dehnen (1999), Chakrabarty (2007), and Gardner and Flinn (2010) estimated the bar
parameters based on simulations to explain the observed bimodal UV velocity distribution
of solar-neighborhood stars. It is important to note that one of the models in Gardner
and Flinn (2010) contained two bars for which close pattern speeds were found. This
means that the two bars can rotate almost synchronously.

Bobylev et al. (2014) estimated the bar orientation parameters using the XPM catalog
(Fedorov et al. 2010), which contains the proper motions of millions of stars. There are
photometric data from the 2MASS catalog for these stars, which allowed the photometric
distances to be estimated, while using the proper motions allowed one to eliminate the
foreground stars and literally to “see” the bar.

Antoja et al. (2014) found the bar pattern speed by comparing their analytical bar
model with stars from the RAVE4 catalog. Distance estimates and highly accurate radial
velocities are available for these stars. In the model of these authors, the Hercules stream
was assumed to be produced by the inﬂuence of the bar and the Galactic spiral structure.
Table 3 does not encompass all of the known results. Note that quite a large selection

of Galactic bar parameter determinations can be found in Vanhollebeke et al. (2009).

The resonant orbits we found show that the bar pattern speed Ωbar lies within the
range 45–55 km s−1 kpc−1, while the bar angle Ωbar is within the range 40◦ − 60◦. The
results obtained are consistent with the view that the Hercules and Wolf 630 streams
could be formed by a single mechanism associated with the splitting of the UV velocity
plane under the inﬂuence of the Galactic bar.

Our results are in agreement with the simulations of Dehnen (1999) for ROLR ≈ 0.9R0.
The bar size estimated from the rotation curve by taking into account the conﬁdence
region for Ωbar is Rbar = 4.2 ± 0.7 kpc (for the adopted R0 = 8 kpc). As can be seen from
Table 3, this resembles a long bar.

CONCLUSIONS

We analyzed the four most signiﬁcant features in the UV velocity distribution of solar-
neighborhood stars: H1, H2 from the Hercules stream and W1, W2 from the Wolf 630
stream with the (U, V ) coordinates of their centers (−33, −51), (−71, −48), (21, −26), and
(40, −24) km s−1, respectively. Based on the assumption that the Hercules and Wolf
630 streams were induced by the central Galactic bar, we formulated the problem of
determining the bar characteristics independently from each of the identiﬁed features.

To construct the Galactic orbits of the individual stars forming these streams, we used
the model of Allen and Santill´an (1991). From the set of constructed orbits, we selected
only the stable orbits in resonance with the bar. Analysis of the resonant orbits found
showed that the bar pattern speed Ωbar lies within the range 45–55 km s−1 kpc−1 with
a mean of 49.1 ± 1.3 km s−1 kpc−1, while the bar angle is within the range 40◦ − 60◦

14

with a mean of 49 ± 5◦. These estimates were shown to be robust when using the various
Galactic rotation curves constructed with the constant R0 whose values lie within a fairly
wide range, from 7.5 to 8.5 kpc.

The results obtained are consistent with the view that the Hercules and Wolf 630
streams could be formed by a single mechanism associated with the fact that a long-term
inﬂuence of the Galactic bar led to a characteristic bimodal splitting of the UV velocity
plane.
