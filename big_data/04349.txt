We show within the saturation framework that measurements of exclusive vector meson production
at high energy provide evidence for strong geometric ﬂuctuations of the proton. In comparison, the
eﬀect of saturation scale and color charge ﬂuctuations is weak. This knowledge will allow detailed
future measurements of the incoherent cross section to tightly constrain the ﬂuctuating geometry of
the proton as a function of the parton momentum fraction x.

Introduction It is of fundamental interest to under-
stand the geometric structure of the proton. This in-
cludes both its average size, shape and ﬂuctuations. The
conventional way to access proton structure is via deep
inelastic scattering (DIS) measurements where a (virtual)
photon scatters oﬀ the proton. For example, the average
proton density described in terms of parton distribution
functions has been extracted accurately by H1 and ZEUS
experiments at HERA [1, 2]. One of the striking ﬁndings
of these measurements is the rapid growth of the gluon
density at small Bjorken x or, equivalently, at high en-
ergy.

At very high energy the Color Glass Condensate
(CGC) eﬀective theory of quantum chromodynamics
(QCD) provides a natural framework to describe the scat-
tering processes [3, 4]. In fact, the accurate description
of the proton structure function data has been a crucial
test for the CGC picture [5–7].

Accessing ﬂuctuations of the geometric shape of the
proton1 is a diﬃcult task. Two possible venues could
allow progress in this direction: On the one hand, high
multiplicity proton-proton and proton-nucleus scattering
experiments performed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion col-
lider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have re-
vealed striking collective phenomena [8–11] (see [12] for a
recent review). The interpretation that these eﬀects are
due to the collective expansion of the system, which is
sensitive to the initial ﬂuctuating geometry as in heavy-
ion collisions, opens up the possibility to access the ﬂuc-
tuating proton shape in these experiments [13, 14].

Alternatively, diﬀractive DIS [15, 16], especially exclu-
sive vector meson production, can provide insight into
the average proton density distribution and its ﬂuctua-
tions.

In such events, a vector meson (e.g. J/Ψ) is produced
with no exchange of net color charge with the proton.
If the target proton remains intact (coherent diﬀraction)
the average color charge density proﬁle is probed.
If,
on the other hand, the proton breaks up, one becomes

tion of the proton.

sensitive to event-by-event ﬂuctuations [16–18]. Diﬀrac-
tive processes with protons and heavier targets have been
studied in perturbative QCD [19] and the CGC frame-
work [18, 20–25]. In this letter, we calculate diﬀractive
vector meson production at small x within an event-
by-event CGC framework. We constrain the amount of
proton shape ﬂuctuations using comparisons to available
incoherent HERA data. A future electron ion collider
[26, 27] has the potential to provide much more precise
data in a wider kinematical range [27, 28], which can
provide even stronger constraints.

Diﬀractive DIS in the dipole picture We study the ex-
clusive production of a vector meson V with momentum
PV in deep inelastic scattering:

l((cid:96)) + p(P ) → l(cid:48)((cid:96)(cid:48)) + p(cid:48)(P (cid:48)) + V (PV ),

(1)
where (cid:96) and (cid:96)(cid:48) are the lepton (l) momenta in the initial
and ﬁnal state, respectively, while P and P (cid:48) are the ini-
tial and ﬁnal proton (p) momenta. The Lorentz invariant
quantities that describe the kinematics are Q2 = −q2 =
−((cid:96) − (cid:96)(cid:48))2, t ≡ −(P (cid:48)
− P )2, xP ≡ (P − P (cid:48)) · q/(P · q) =
(M 2 + Q2 − t)/(W 2 + Q2 − m2
N ). Here mN is the proton
mass, M is the mass of the produced vector meson and
W 2 = (P + q)2 is the total center-of-mass energy squared
of the virtual photon-proton scattering.
In diﬀractive
DIS xP plays the role of Bjorken-x in DIS, and it cor-
responds to the longitudinal momentum fraction trans-
ferred from the target proton.

In the dipole picture diﬀractive vector meson produc-
tion involves the ﬂuctuation of a virtual photon, emit-
ted by the lepton, into a quark-antiquark color dipole.
This dipole then scatters elastically oﬀ the target hadron
without exchanging net color charge, and ﬁnally forms
the diﬀractively produced vector meson, in our analysis
a J/Ψ meson.

Following Ref. [29] the scattering amplitude for the

diﬀractive vector meson production can be written as

of the virtual photon longitudinal momentum carried by

The large J/Ψ mass provides the scale that suppresses
non-perturbative contributions from large dipole sizes.
The overlap between the virtual photon and vector me-
son wave functions is given by Ψ∗ΨV . The virtual photon
wave function Ψ, describing γ∗
→ q ¯q splitting, can be
computed from perturbative QED, but the formation of
a vector meson from a color dipole is a non-perturbative
process and must be modeled. In this work, we use the
Boosted Gaussian wave function parametrization [29].

In coherent diﬀraction, the target proton remains in-

tact and the cross section can be written as [29]

The brackets (cid:104)(cid:105) refer to an average over target conﬁgura-

the small-x structure of the proton dominated by gluons
is probed. The coherent cross section is sensitive to the
average gluon density, as it is obtained from the aver-
aged scattering amplitude. On the other hand, when the
proton breaks up (but the event is still diﬀractive, and
there is no exchange of color charge between the proton
and the vector meson), the incoherent cross section is
obtained as a variance (see e.g. Refs. [18, 23]):

The dipole amplitude N in principle satisﬁes the small-x

evolution equation. However, knowledge of the impact
parameter dependence of N is crucial in order to evaluate
the diﬀractive scattering amplitude (2), and the impact
parameter dependent JIMWLK and BK equations de-
velop unphysical Coulomb tails that should be regulated
by conﬁnement scale physics [36, 37]. Thus, we choose
to use the impact parameter dependent saturation model
(IPsat), as well as the IP-Glasma model [38, 39] to de-
termine the dipole amplitude.

smaller lattice spacings do not alter the results. For more

Phenomenological corrections

In the IPsat model, the
cross sections are obtained by replacing the dipole am-
plitude with its imaginary part. Correcting them by
a factor of (1 + β2), with β = tan πλ/2 and λ =
(d ln Aγ∗p→J/Ψp
)/(d ln 1/xP), accounts for the real part
[29]. The real part correction is of the order of 10% in the
kinematical range considered in this work and depends
weakly on |t|. In the IP-Glasma the dipole amplitude is
used directly and we do not include this correction.
The skewedness correction takes into account the oﬀ-
diagonal nature of the gluon distribution involved in
the process.
In the linearized approximation, where
two gluons are exchanged with the target, these glu-
ons carry diﬀerent longitudinal momentum fractions x1
and x2 (to and from the target, to achieve a total
momentum transfer of xP).
In the high energy limit
the dominant contribution is from the region xP ≈

x1 (cid:29) x2, and the oﬀ-diagonal gluon distribution func-
tion can be expressed by the diagonal gluon distribution
xPg(xP) corrected by a skewedness factor Rg [29, 43, 44]
Rg = 22λg+3Γ(λg + 5/2)/(√π Γ(λg + 4)) with λg =
(d ln xPg(xP, µ2))/(ln 1/xP). The skewedness correction
is numerically important, being of the order of 40% in
the kinematical region relevant to this work. For the
IP-Glasma cross section the skewedness correction is ap-
proximated by that to the round IPsat proton.

Fluctuating proton shape

If the proton does not ﬂuc-
tuate the variance of the amplitude (2) vanishes and the
incoherent cross section (4) is zero. However, the inco-
herent diﬀractive cross section was measured by HERA
to be signiﬁcant [45–47].2

We include geometric ﬂuctuations of the proton in the
IPsat model by introducing a constituent quark model,
in which the gluonic density of the proton is distributed
around the three valence quarks. The physical picture
here is that when moving towards small x, the large-
x valence quarks radiate gluons that will be localized
around the original positions of the quarks.

The density proﬁle of each constituent quark is as-

sumed to be Gaussian

Tq(b) =

1

2πBq

e−b2/(2Bq) ,

(10)

with width parameter Bq. This corresponds to the re-
placement

(11)

in the dipole cross section Eq. (6), where bi are the trans-
verse coordinates of the Nq = 3 constituent quarks, sam-
pled from a Gaussian distribution with width Bqc.

In the linear regime (r2 (cid:28) 1/Q2

s) contributions to
the proton structure function F2 in the ﬂuctuating case
are exactly the same as in the original IPsat framework,
which is constrained by HERA data. Modiﬁcations of
large r2 contributions are possible, but their eﬀects are
suppressed in diﬀractive J/Ψ production.

In the IP-Glasma model we use the same modiﬁcations
to include ﬂuctuations. Explicitly, we use Eq. (6) with
the replacement (11) to determine Qs(b, xP) and from
that the spatial color charge density distribution.

Saturation scale ﬂuctuations

In addition to geometric
ﬂuctuations the proton saturation scale Qs can ﬂuctuate
event-by-event. These ﬂuctuations can be expected to be
localized in a transverse area ∼ 1/Q2
s.
Experimentally observed multiplicity distributions and
rapidity correlations in p+p collisions are best described

2 H1 data in Ref. [47] is the total diﬀractive cross section, which

at high-|t| is purely incoherent to good accuracy.

with σ ∼ 0.5. In the constituent quark model a natu-
ral way to implement these ﬂuctuations is to have the
saturation scale of each of the quarks ﬂuctuate indepen-
dently. As Q2
s is proportional to F (xP, r)Tp(b) in (6),
these ﬂuctuations can be implemented by modifying the
normalization of the quark density function Tq.

Alternatively, one can implement the ﬂuctuations by
dividing the transverse plane into a grid, and let Q2
s ﬂuc-
tuate in each grid cell. The natural scale for the size of
the grid cells is the typical 1/Q2
s (cf. [50]), which for the
EIC and HERA kinematics we consider corresponds to
a ∼ 0.4 fm.
Results To study the eﬀect of geometric ﬂuctuations
on the coherent and incoherent diﬀractive J/Ψ produc-
tion cross sections, we vary the proton size Bqc (which
determines the distribution of quark centers) and quark
width parameter Bq in the IPsat framework.

Fig. 1 shows both coherent and incoherent cross
sections compared to HERA photoproduction data at
(cid:104)W(cid:105) = 100 GeV [46, 47, 51, 52]. With this kinemat-
ics one is sensitive to the proton structure at x ≈ 10−3.
The incoherent cross section is extremely sensitive to the
degree of geometric ﬂuctuations of the proton. While the
smoother proton parametrized as Bqc = 1.0 GeV−2, Bq =
3.0 GeV−2 gives a good description of the coherent J/Ψ
production cross section, the incoherent cross section
is largely underestimated (by more than an order of

FIG. 3: Four conﬁgurations of the proton in the IP-Glasma
model, represented by 1 − Re( Tr V )/Nc.

IP-Glasma framework Coulomb tails are produced that
are regulated by conﬁnement scale physics implemented
via the mass term m. These tails eﬀectively increase
the proton size, and when combined with the constituent
quark model, weaken the ﬂuctuations. It is the combi-
nation of Bqc, Bq and m that characterizes the degree of
geometric ﬂuctuations in the IP-Glasma framework. We
have checked that reducing m increases Coulomb tails
and requires the reduction of Bqc and Bq to maintain
agreement with the experimental data.

In the limit t → 0 the incoherent cross section should
vanish, as it is not possible to break up the proton with
zero momentum transfer. However, this eﬀect is not ex-
plicitly included in our framework.
Instead, the color
charge ﬂuctuations in the IP-Glasma model and possi-
ble Qs ﬂuctuations make the scattering amplitude (2)
at t = 0 ﬂuctuate from event to event, resulting in a
non-zero variance (4). Our results for the incoherent
cross section at small |t| in Fig. 1 (only geometric ﬂuctu-
ations) and Fig. 2 indicate that this problem is negligible
for t (cid:38) 0.1 GeV2, where geometric ﬂuctuations start to
dominate.

Fig. 3 shows example proton conﬁgurations in the IP-
Glasma model with constituent quarks, demonstrating
the strong shape variations required to achieve compati-
bility with experimental data. For simplicity, the quan-
tity shown is 1 − Re( Tr V )/Nc.
Similar to the color charge ﬂuctuations in the IP-
Glasma framework, saturation scale ﬂuctuations alone
result in an incoherent cross section, which is orders of
magnitude below the experimental data. The coherent
and incoherent spectra obtained by combining geometric
and Qs ﬂuctuations on the level of constituent quarks

are further apart on average (Bqc = 3.5 GeV−2, Bq =
0.5 . . . 1 GeV−2),
leads to an incoherent cross section
compatible with the data, while maintaining a good de-
scription of the coherent |t| spectrum. Consequently we
also expect to maintain a good description of the Q2 and
W dependence of the coherent J/Ψ production cross sec-
tion [6] and the agreement with the diﬀractive structure
function data [22] within the IPsat model.

Note that the average distance of a constituent quark

(cid:113)

q(cid:105) =(cid:112)2Bqc = 0.3 fm

from the center of the proton is
for the smoother proton and 0.4 fm for the lumpy proton
we consider. We also show the conventional IPsat result,
which has zero ﬂuctuations and thus zero incoherent cross
section.

(cid:104)r2

In the IP-Glasma framework the additional color
charge ﬂuctuations produce a non-zero incoherent cross
section even without geometric ﬂuctuations. The eﬀect of
this kind of ﬂuctuations on incoherent diﬀractive vector
meson production was considered in [53] in the Gaus-
sian approximation and found to be suppressed as 1/N 2
c .
The result for a round proton with Bp = 4 GeV−2 and
m = 0.4 GeV in Fig. 2 shows that these ﬂuctuations
alone are not enough to describe the measured incoher-
ent cross section. However, the IP-Glasma model com-
bined with a constituent quark picture with parameters
Bqc = 2 GeV−2, Bq = 0.3 GeV−2, and m = 0.4 GeV pro-
duces coherent and incoherent cross sections compatible
with the data. This emphasizes the necessity of geomet-
ric ﬂuctuations in a description of the transverse struc-
ture of the proton, which is in line with ﬁndings in p+A
collisions [14].

Note that even though the color charge density is sam-
pled from a proton described by the IPsat model, in the

Glasma model [38] underestimate the measured incoher-
ent cross section by up to several orders of magnitude.
In the future, diﬀerent models for the ﬂuctuating proton
geometry (see e.g.
[54]) can be implemented. However,
we do not expect our results to be largely aﬀected by the
details of the model, as long as the degree of lumpiness
remains the same.

More precise measurements from a future Electron Ion
Collider will allow to tightly constrain the ﬂuctuating
shape of the proton at various values of Bjorken x. Our
calculations can be improved by implementing QCD evo-
lution via the JIMWLK equation [30–32], which can de-
termine the x-dependence of the ﬂuctuating proton shape
[37].

FIG. 4: Coherent cross section normalized by incoherent cross
section compared with ZEUS data [45]. The IPsat curve with
σ = 0.5 refers to the case where the saturation scales of the
constituent quarks ﬂuctuate following the distribution (12).

or on a grid with cell size a = 0.4 fm are almost indis-
tinguishable. The incoherent cross section increases by

∼ 40 % for |t| (cid:38) 0.3 GeV2 when using σ = 0.5. This

increase is partially caused by the change of the expecta-
tion value of the log-normal probability distribution (12)
with the degree of ﬂuctuations characterized by σ. Since
this eﬀect also increases the normalization of the coher-
ent cross sections, it will be eliminated when we study
the ratio of the cross sections.

This ratio has been measured by the ZEUS collabora-
tion starting from relatively small |t| [45]. Fig. 4 shows
the ratio obtained with diﬀerent parametrizations for the
ﬂuctuating structure of the proton. Again, a smoother
proton (Bqc = 1.0 GeV−2, Bq = 3.0 GeV−2) is not in
agreement with the experimental data, while a strongly
ﬂuctuating proton is compatible with the data. The ef-
fect of Qs ﬂuctuations is small (within our statistical er-

ror) for |t| (cid:38) 0.5 GeV2. Experimental errors are large
around the intermediate |t| ∼ 1 GeV2. This is exactly
where a future electron ion collider can improve the sit-
uation by providing much more precise data to constrain
the ﬂuctuating proton shape.

Conclusions and Outlook

In this letter we have shown
that incoherent diﬀractive vector meson production pro-
vides a sensitive probe of the ﬂuctuating shape of the
proton. We implemented geometric ﬂuctuations using a
constituent quark model, and included realistic satura-
tion scale and color charge ﬂuctuations. We showed that
the description of the incoherent cross section measured
at HERA around |t| ∼ 0.5 . . . 2 GeV2 requires strong ge-
ometric ﬂuctuations. For a ﬁxed proton geometry, sat-
