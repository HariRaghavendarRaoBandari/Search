FERROMAGNETISM AND PARTICLE COLLISIONS: APPLICATIONS TO PROTOPLANETARY DISKS AND THE

METEORITICAL RECORD

ALEXANDER HUBBARD1

(Dated: March 11, 2016, Revision: 1.20 )

Draft version March 11, 2016

ABSTRACT

The meteoritical record shows both iron partitioning and tungsten isotopic partitioning between matrix and
chondrules. Tungsten is not abundant enough to have driven its own isotopic partitioning, but if tungsten were
correlated with iron, then ferromagnetic interactions grains could help explain both observations. We derive
a practical parameterization for the increase in particle-particle collision rates caused by mutually attracting
particle magnetic dipole moments. While the appropriate magnetic parameters remain uncertain, we show
that ambient magnetic ﬁelds in protoplanetary disks are expected to be strong enough to magnetize iron metal
bearing dust grains sufﬁciently to drive large increases in their collision rates. Such increased collision rates
between iron metal rich grains could help preserve primordial iron and W isotopic inhomogeneities; and would
help explain why the meteoritical record shows their partitioning in the solar nebula. The importance of mag-
netic interactions for larger grains whose growth is balanced by fragmentation is less clear, and will require
future laboratory or numerical studies.

1. INTRODUCTION

Laboratory examinations of meteorites provide a fascinat-
ing window into dust processing during the ﬁrst stages of
planet formation. Chondritic meteorites, being undifferenti-
ated, record the nebular state of the dust with some ﬁdelity
(Lodders 2003). In particular, they are named after the chon-
drules they contain: sub-mm melted glassy beads (Hewins
1997). While chondrules were clearly dramatically thermally
processed, they nonetheless inform us about their collision-
ally grown precursors.

One bizarre feature of chondrites is that chondrules are
strongly depleted of iron relative to the inter-chondrule, non-
thermally processed matrix material. Indeed, iron metal abun-
dance is one of the primary vectors along which meteoritical
compositions vary (Grossman & Wasson 1982). There have
been many studies of the behavior of iron under chondrule
forming temperatures, and the difﬁculty in reproducing obser-
vations argues strongly for differing chondrules to have been
formed in regions of differing chemical abundances (Gross-
man 1996; Cohen & Hewins 2004; Ebel et al. 2008). While
large variations in rare element abundances might be expected
through nugget effects, iron represents approximately 20%
of a chondrite’s mass (Lodders 2003). Chondrules precur-
sors would have been formed by agglomerating billions of ex-
tremely sticky (G¨uttler et al. 2010) sub-micron pre-solar dust
grains, and that agglomeration process should have washed
out any primordial compositional inhomogeneities. Nonethe-
less, to reproduce observations it seems necessary for iron, or
some other element abundant enough to react with a signif-
icant fraction of the iron, to have been partitioned between
different classes of dust grain. It is unclear how that could
have occurred.

Budde et al. (2015) further found tungsten isotopic par-
titioning between chondrules and matrix. Tungsten is ex-
tremely refractory and isotopic differences do not alter chem-

istry, making the W isotopic partitioning even more puzzling
than that of iron. Tungsten is also far too rare to affect the
process of dust growth itself. The observed W isotope parti-
tioning requires that tungsten have been carried into the solar
nebula by at least two different families of pre-solar grains
with different isotopic abundances. It further requires that the
dust coagulation process have kept those families separate,
and ﬁnally that the chondrule formation process have treated
those families differently.

One way for iron, and tungsten isotopes, to have been parti-
tioned between matrix and chondrules is for matrix and chon-
drules to have been produced in different spatial locations, or
at different times, from ambient dust of different pre-solar ori-
gins. This possibility is unlikely because of complementarity:
the composition of matrix and chondrules are strongly corre-
lated (Hezel & Palme 2010). Further, Goldberg et al. (2015)
showed that that correlation requires matrix and chondrules
to have been co-genetic. Accordingly, there is a need for a
model of dust growth which takes a well-mixed initial cloud
of dust and manages to preserve primordial inhomogeneities
between grains within that cloud during the dust coagulation
phase. The model must further allow for the chondrule forma-
tion to treat dust grains of differing compositions differently.

2. INVOKING MAGNETIC INTERACTIONS

In this paper, we mostly leave aside the chondrule formation
process, which we discuss in a companion paper (Hubbard
2016). Instead, we focus on the dust coagulation. We require
a process for preserving dust families with differing primor-
dial compositions that can operate even at the sub-micron in-
terstellar grain scale (Draine 2003). Given that tiny interstel-
lar grains are extremely sticky (G¨uttler et al. 2010), this rules
out processes that only effect the surface stickiness: the need
to preserve the families starting from interstellar, sub-micron,
completely sticky grains means that the composition of the
grains needs to correlate with the collision rate itself, not just
the sticking fraction rate of the collisions. We will also ad-
dress the issue of how large the difference in the dust coagu-

2

lation process needs to be for the families to end up with dif-
ferent aerodynamics. Differing dust aerodynamics allows for
dust spatial sorting, which would allow a spatially restricted
chondrule formation mechanism to process the families at dif-
ferent rates as is discussed in detail in Hubbard (2016).

In Hubbard (2014) we examined how dust-dust collisions
were affected by the interaction of magnetic dipole moments
induced in their iron-metal component by the strong nebu-
lar magnetic ﬁelds expected in the solar nebula near Mer-
cury’s orbit. We found that the magnetic interactions were
extremely strong, and could erode silicates leaving behind
large iron metal rich dust particles.
Inspired by that work,
and by the iron partitioning problem, we here examine how
important it is to include the interaction of magnetic dipoles
induced by the much weaker nebular magnetic ﬁelds expected
in protoplanetary disks at the orbital position of the asteroid
belt. Given the strong uncertainties in many of the parameters,
in particular the abundance and relative magnetic permeabil-
ity of astrophysical iron-nickel alloys, our primary result is
the derivation a practical parameterization for how effectively
magnetic dipole interactions promote dust grain collisions and
collisional growth.

That parameterization suggests that magnetic interactions
should indeed have played a major role in the ﬁrst stages
of dust growth, dramatically enhancing the dust-dust colli-
sion rates and promoting collisions between iron-rich dust
grains over collisions between iron-poor grains. That latter
would have helped preserve primordial iron inhomogeneities.
It also provides a way to preserve primordial tungsten iso-
topic anomalies, so long as those anomalies were correlated
with grain ferro-magnetism. However the magnitude of the
effect is much lower at the dust size scale where collisional
growth is balanced by fragmentation. We suggest that while
magnetic attraction would not have strongly altered that equi-
librium grain size, it could have helped prevent iron metal rich
dust grain sub-components from fragmenting, allowing mag-
netic erosion (Hubbard 2014) to have proceeded, generating
iron metal inhomogeneities. Further, as is discussed in Hub-
bard (2016), even modest differences in equilibrium grain size
could lead to signiﬁcant differences in chondrule processing
rates.

GRAINS

3.1. Parameter deﬁnitions

We follow the formalism of Hubbard (2014), with m, mi
and f ≡ mi/m denoting a dust grain’s total mass, iron metal
mass, and metal mass fraction respectively. Dust grains are
assumed spherical, with radii a, density ρ and volume

of which

us to calculate the metal volume fraction g:

Note that collisionally aggregated dust grains in protoplane-

where φ is the volume ﬁlling fraction,

Outside of limited regions of extremely strong magnetic
ﬁelds (Hubbard 2014), the ambient magnetic ﬁeld H in proto-
planetary disks is generally too weak to magnetize iron metal
near to saturation.2 We therefore use the relationship

M =

µrH
4π

,

(7)

where M is the magnetization induced by the ambient ﬁeld
and µr is the magnetic relative permeability when consider-
ing magnetically soft materials, which are the main thrust of
this paper. Further, we assume that the iron metal is evenly
distributed throughout our dust grains. We parameterize the
ambient magnetic ﬁeld H in terms of the thermal pressure
through the plasma β parameter:

8πnkBT

H 2

=

8πρgkBT

¯mH 2

β ≡

(8)

where n is the number density of the gas, ρg its density and
¯m its the mean molecular mass. It follows that

H 2 =

8πρgkBT

¯mβ

.

(9)

Given the strongly radially decreasing gas density expected in
protoplanetary disks, Equation (9) implies that there should
exist an outer radius outside of which induced magnetization
is negligible.

3.2. Parameter normalizations

We use the gas parameters of a Hayashi MMSN’s midplane
at R = 2.5 AU, appropriate for the asteroid belt (Hayashi
1981). Unfortunately, most of the magnetic parameters used
in this paper are poorly constrained. The values we normalize
to, denoted with overbars, are listed in Table 1. The relative
permeability of iron metal, µr, depends on its manufacture,
composition, history and the amplitude of the ambient ﬁeld,
potentially varying from 0 up to tens of thousands for some

2 Studies of magnetic ﬁelds in protoplanetary disks generally use the B
ﬁeld rather than the H ﬁeld because the contribution of magnetized solids is
negligible.

nickel-iron alloys (Weast 1975). We normalize, possibly opti-
mistically, to ¯µr = 1000, and hope that this work will inspire
future research to shed light on this parameter.

Similarly, the amplitude of the ambient magnetic ﬁeld H is
unclear, in no small part because we do not fully understand
the behavior of the ﬁeld in magnetically “dead” zones such
as the midplane at R = 2.5 AU (Gammie 1996). However,
recent work has suggested that the Hall effect can allow sig-
niﬁcant ﬁeld growth even there (Bai 2014), implying that the
term “dead zone” may be a misnomer, leading us to normal-
ize to ¯β = 100. For the parameters in Table 1, and using
Equations (7) and (9), we ﬁnd

(10)
signiﬁcantly less than the saturated magnetization of iron of
(Weast 1975):

¯M (cid:39) 10 emu/cc3,

MS (cid:39) 1720 emu/cc3.

(11)
The appropriate iron metal fraction for dust in protoplane-
tary disks is unknown, but inspired by the low iron fraction of
astrophysical silicates (Draine 2003) we adopt ¯f ∼ 0.2, the
overall chondritic iron mass fraction (Lodders 2003). To esti-
mate the parameter g we also need an estimate for the overall
grain density (or equivalently the overall grain volume ﬁlling
factor). Collisionally grown grains are expected to be highly
porous, but as the collisional speeds approach ones capable of
rearranging the grains, the grains will be collisionally com-
pacted and the volume ﬁlling fractions will rise (Seizinger
et al. 2012). We adopt ¯φ = 0.1, which when inserted into
Equations (3) through (6) implies that

¯g = ¯f

¯φ ρs
ρi

= 0.0076,

(12)

although we will be invoking grains both enriched in metallic
iron (higher f, g), and depleted in metallic iron (lower f, g).

3.3. Magnetically enhanced collisional cross section:

magnetically soft case

Consider two dust grains 1 and 2 close to each other, and
embedded in an external magnetic ﬁeld. It is easiest to op-
erate in either the limit of either identically sized grains or
asymptotically different sized grains with a1 (cid:29) a2. The the-
ory of turbulently stirred dust collisions is far simpler in the
latter case, so we will henceforth require a1 (cid:29) a2. Accord-
ingly, we place our larger grain 1 at the origin and consider
it ﬁxed, while following the motion of the smaller grain 2.
We will assume that the dust grains are perfectly magneti-
cally soft: i.e. that their magnetizations are controlled purely
by a spatially uniform external magnetic ﬁeld H according to
Equation (7); and we adopt a spherical coordinate system with
θ the polar coordinate and the axis aligned with the external
ﬁeld (and hence the magnetic dipole moments). For simplic-
ity we assume that non-size dependent parameters other than
f and g, i.e. ρ, φ, µr, and M, are identical for both grains.
The magnetic energy of the dipole-dipole interaction is

UM = −

1
r3 [3(M 1 · ˆr)(M 2 · ˆr) − M 1 · M 2] ,

(13)

where ˆr is the unit vector joining the two grains, and M 1,2 are
the dipole moments. Because we have assumed that the dipole
moments are aligned with the external ﬁeld along the pole of
our coordinate system, and we have assumed that the relative

magnetic permeabilities of the grains are equal, Equation (13)
reduces to

UM = ∀i1∀i2M 2

r3

(cid:2)1 − 3 cos2(θ)(cid:3) ,

where (r, θ) is the position of grain 2, and θ = 0 is the pole.
We can calculate the radial magnetic force using Equa-

tion (14):

(14)

(15)

F M = −∂rUM ˆr.

Two point masses cannot interact in a way which would
change their angular momentum. Further, magnetic dipoles
embedded in a uniform external magnetic ﬁeld feel no net
force, but only a torque acting to align them with the exter-
nal ﬁeld. Accordingly, even though −∂θUM (cid:54)= 0, our system
conserves its orbital angular momentum. This can be under-
stood by noting that while Equation (14) is written in terms
of θ, the actual dependency in Equation (13) is on the align-
ment of the magnetic dipole moments; and the apparent force
−∂θUM actually represents the torques the two grains exert
on each other to align their dipole moments: the torque drives
spin, rather than orbital angular momentum, and we are ne-
glecting the spin of the particles. Because the particles would
be torquing each-other to stay magnetically aligned, we would
expect any spin they would develop to be aligned with, and ex-
tracted from, their orbital angular momentum. Accordingly,
our treatment of the motion of the grains as spin-free will un-
derestimate the effect of their magnetic interactions.

As noted above, by assuming that the magnetization of the
two grains is purely controlled by the external ﬁeld, we are
neglecting the fact their magnetic dipole-dipole interactions
will further work to align the dipole moments. Note that if the
grains are close enough together, the dipole moment of one
can induce a dipole moment in the second, which strongly al-
ters the close-approach physics and further strengthens the at-
traction between the two particles (see e.g. Mehdizadeh et al.
2010). This simpliﬁcation therefore results in a further under-
estimate of the magnetic attraction for the two grains.

We can estimate the magnetic enhancement to the colli-
sional cross-section by considering polar orbits (constant az-
imuth). Using Equations (14) and (15), the magnetic force on
grain 2 is

FM =

3∀i1∀i2M 2

r4

(cid:2)1 − 3 cos2(θ)(cid:3) .

If grain 2 has an initial velocity vθ = v0 at an initial position
(r0, θ0), then it has angular momentum per unit mass

L = r0v0,

and hence a polar velocity

vθ(r) =

L
r

We can use Equations (16) and (18) to write

(23)

(24)

where ˜r ≡ r/rc and ˜t ≡ t/tc.
We can integrate Equations (23) and (24) forward in time
for given values of r0/rc and θ0, determining whether r will
hit zero (i.e. a magnetic collision). However, the limiting
value of r0/rc for which collisions occur (when one exists)
for any given value of θ0 is complicated. Nonetheless, the
only control parameter for Equations (23) and (24) is r0/rc,
so the collisional cross-section for magnetic interactions be-
c. We can there-
tween the two dust grains must scale with r2
fore write

σm(v) = Cπr2
c

(25)
for the magnetic collisional cross-section, where C is a con-
stant. For θ0 = 0, r0/rc = 0.49 is the limiting value for
which collisions occur, and we adopt ¯C = 0.2 (cid:46) .0.492 as an
approximation for C, noting that our analysis underestimates
the strength of the magnetic interactions, and that grains only
need to approach to r = a1 + a2 (cid:39) a1 to collide.
This allows us to deﬁne the ratio of the magnetic collisional
cross-section σm to the geometrical cross-section σg ≡ πa2

For velocities where σm(v) (cid:29) σg, the magnetic cross-section
applies, and when σm(v) (cid:28) σg, the velocities are too high
for magnetic forces to play a role, and the geometric cross-
section applies. We approximate the intermediate regime by
assuming that σ = max(σm, σg).

Using Equation (26) we can deﬁne the critical magnetic ve-

locity vm such that σm(vm) = σg:

To calculate how much magnetic interactions change collision

This estimate for vm is respectably high compared to esti-
mates for the velocity at which dust grains bounced rather
than stuck together in the solar nebula, and justiﬁes the re-
mainder of this paper (G¨uttler et al. 2010). Note that vm ∝
ρ1/2
, so the strength of magnetic dipole interactions will gen-
g
erally decrease with orbital position.

3.4. Magnetically enhanced collisional cross section:

magnetically hard case

In the case of magnetically hard magnetic dipoles not em-
bedded in an external magnetic ﬁeld, we can approximate
that the magnetic torques act to keep the dipole moments
optimally aligned. In that limit, Equation (14) simpliﬁes to
UM = −2∀i1∀i2M 2/r3. In this case, a grain with initial ve-
locity vθ = v0 at r0 = rc would be on an unstable circular
orbit, and the corresponding estimate for C is C = 1. This
would be a reasonable approximation for dust grains each
with only a single magnetic domain, and for which Equa-
tion (29) would become

where we have used Equations (10) and (11). More extreme
than Equation (29), this value for vm is large enough for
magnetized interactions to dominate dust coagulation even
at scales often associated with fragmentation (G¨uttler et al.
2010). Note that observations of interstellar dust imply that
only a small fraction of interstellar iron could be in the form
of such single-domain magnetically saturated iron-nickel dust
grains however (Draine & Lazarian 1999).

4. EFFECT OF MAGNETIZATION ON COLLISION

RATES

4.1. Turbulent collisional velocity distribution

Our current picture for the collisional coagulation phase of
dust growth at and below the size associated with chondrule
precursors is one where macroscopic grains are stirred by both
turbulence and Brownian motion. The degree of gas-dust cou-
pling is captured by the dust Stokes number

(31)
where τ is the dust drag time and Ω the local Keplerian fre-
quency. Near the midplane of a vertically isothermal disk in
vertical hydrostatic equilibrium we have

St ≡ τ Ω,

√2πaρ

Σg

St (cid:39)

(32)

where a is a dust grain’s radius, ρ its density and Σg the gas
surface density, and in this paper, where relevant, we assume
that St (cid:28) 1. In that limit, turbulence drives a relative velocity
between dust grains which scales as (Voelk et al. 1980; Cuzzi
& Hogan 2003):

vt ∝

(33)
where the strength of the turbulence is measured through the
Shakura-Sunyaev α parameter (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973).
We can see from Equations (32) and (33) that larger dust
grains collide more violently than smaller ones.

If the two dust grains are very different in size, as we as-
sumed in Section 3, the turbulently driven velocity distribu-

n(v, v0) = n0

(34)

(cid:18) v

(cid:19)2

v0

where n(v) is the number density of targets with relative ve-
locity |v| per unit relative velocity. The velocity scale v0 is
controlled by Equation (33). We assume Equation (34) hence-
forth, noting that it also applies in the Brownian motion limit
appropriate for very small particles extremely well coupled to
the gas.

4.2. Collision rates

The rate at which a dust grain will collide with other grains

at velocities between v1 < v2 is

(cid:90) v2

v1

R(v1, v2) ≡

dv n(v) σ(v) v,

(35)

Figure 1. Blue/solid curve: fractional increase in collision rate due to mag-
netic interactions as a function of vm/v0 (Equation 41). Green/dashed curve:

where n(v) is the number density of targets with relative ve-
locity |v| per unit relative velocity, and σ the effective colli-
sional cross-section (which may depend on the relative veloc-
ity). In the absence of magnetic effects, we have only the geo-
metric cross-section, i.e. σ = σg. Combining Equations (34)
and (35) we ﬁnd:

where the subscript g (geometric)
is used for non-

total geometric collision rate is given by

Rg = Rg(0,∞) = 2n0σgv2
0,

(38)
where one must recall that n0 is a number density per unit ve-
locity. Note also that R (and hence all its variants in this pa-
per) is a function of everything that the distribution n depends
on. This reduces to R also depending on v0 if Equation (34)
is assumed.

Magnetic interactions only matter for velocities v < vm.
Requiring v2 < vm we can therefore write the rate of mag-
netically mediated collisions as:

The important control parameter is clearly the ratio vm/v0:
if it is large, then magnetic effects are important for the bulk
of the potential collisional partners, while if it is small most
potential collisional partners are moving too fast for the mag-
netic effects to play a role.

While Equation (41) is somewhat complicated, many of its
terms become negligible for large vm/v0, and we can approx-
imate

We plot both Equations (41) and (42) in Figure 1, and one can
see that the approximation is extremely good for vm/v0 (cid:38) 2.
Further, for vm/v0 > 2.56, ¯Rm/Rg > 1 and magnetic inter-
actions play a dominant role, more than doubling the collision
rate.

4.3. Varying f

If we start with a population of dust grains with varying iron

metal mass fractions, then vm ∝ √f1f2 (see Equation 27).

For very small dust grains, which could even be to small to
couple collisionally to turbulence and instead collide through
Brownian motion (which also has a Maxwellian distribution),
we expect vm (cid:29) v0, and so ¯Rm/Rg (cid:39) 0.56(vm/v0)4/3
(further simplifying Equation 42). In this case, the collision
rate between iron rich grains is enhanced compared to that
between iron poor grains, which can help preserve an initial
iron inhomogeneity. Take a scenario in which half of the iron
is found in metal poor grains making up 90% of the popula-
tion with fmp = f0 (associated with a magnetic velocity vm),
while the other half is found in the 10% of the grains that are
metal rich with fmr = 9f0. In that case, the ratio of the rates at

0246810vm/v0−2024681012¯Rm/R6

which iron rich grains will collide with each other compared
to colliding with iron poor grains is

mr)2/3

0.1 × (f 2
0.9 × (fmpfmr)4/3 ∼ 0.48,

(43)

over four times the ratio that would occur in the absence of
magnetic interactions. While collisional growth will still act
to erase inhomogeneities, magnetic interactions dramatically
reduce the rate at which it does so.

5. BOUNCING AND FRAGMENTATION

5.1. Bouncing barrier

Collisional dust growth is expected to continue until the
grains begin to collide rapidly enough that electrostatic stick-
ing forces are inadequate to hold them together upon impact
and they begin to bounce. This will occur for collisional ve-
locities on the order of (G¨uttler et al. 2010):

vb ∼ 10−2 − 1 cm s−1.

(44)
Those estimates are mostly below that of Equation (29), so
it is interested to explore the effects of magnetic interactions
on sticking rates. One must note that the release of magnetic
potential energy means that magnetically mediated interac-
tions occurring at v = vb will lead to collisions at veloci-
ties v > vb. However, this velocity increase is due to the
magnetic potential energy well that the collisional participants
must exit for bouncing to occur; and we expect some of the
kinetic energy to be thermalized or go into rearranging the
dust grains. Magnetic interactions should therefore increase
the effective bouncing velocity, although conﬁrmation will re-
quire future experimental and numerical work. If the magnet-
ically mediated collisions are violent enough, they could even
lead to fragmentation, although the iron components would
remain bound (e.g. magnetic erosion, Hubbard 2014). For
now, we assume that the critical velocities for bouncing are
not changed by consideration of magnetic effects.

Using Equation (35), we can write the sticking rate as

S ≡ R(0, vb/v0) =

dv n(v, v0) σeff(v) v.

(45)

In the absence of magnetic interactions we can use Equa-
tion (37) to ﬁnd:

also that even for small vm/v0, magnetic interactions can be-
come arbitrarily important if vm > vb: all the interactions that
don’t bounce are magnetically mediated.

5.1.1. Limiting approximations

While the full form of ¯Sm/Sg is lengthy, one is generally
in the limit that vc (cid:29) v0 or vc (cid:28) v0, and both limits admit
simplifying approximations. In the limit that vc (cid:29) v0, we
have (using Equation 42):

¯Sm

This occurs because only a negligible fraction of encounters
are at a high enough velocity for bouncing to matter.

fragmentation. We parameterize this balance through

R(0, vb/v0) = ψR(vf /v0,∞),

(56)
where ψ is the critical growth-neutral ratio of the sticking rate
to the fragmentation rate. We also choose to deﬁne the ratio
of the fragmentation and bouncing velocities as

ξ ≡ vf /vb.

(57)
Note that vb, vf and ξ depend on the microphysics of the colli-
sions, and we have assumed that they are independent of any
magnetic interactions. Combining Equations (29), (44) and
(55), we expect vf (cid:29) vm > vb for magnetically soft grains.
Accordingly, for a given dust grain size (and hence collisional
velocity scale v0), including magnetic interactions would not
effect the fragmentation rate, but would increase the sticking
rate. If ψ is constant, then magnetized grains would ﬁnd a bal-
ance between sticking and fragmentation for larger collisional
velocity scales, and hence at larger dust grain sizes. As is ex-
plored in Hubbard (2016), differences in dust grain sizes leads
to aerodynamical sorting which could be correlated with the
chondrule formation process. Such a correlation would pro-
vide an explanation for the observed partitioning of iron, and
of tungsten isotopes, between chondrules and matrix (Gross-
man & Wasson 1982; Budde et al. 2015).

In the geometric case we can consider Equation (56) to be
an equation for vb/v0 (and hence vf /v0) as a function of ψ
and ξ. In this case Equation (56) becomes

noting that n0 and σ have cancelled, and v0 only shows up
in ratio with vb. We write ug(ψ, ξ) as the solution of Equa-
tion (58) for vb/v0. However, it is crucial to note that we have
assumed that vb is set by the microphysics, so ug actually
measures v0. Accordingly, we deﬁne

v0,g(ψ, ξ, vb) ≡ vb/ug,

(59)
the collisional velocity scale for Equation (34) at which stick-
ing and fragmentation are balanced for a set of parameters
(ψ, ξ, vb).

For the magnetic case we can similarly use

Rm(0, vb/v0) = ψRm(vf /v0,∞)

(60)
to deﬁne um(ψ, ξ, vb, vm) as the solution of Equation (60) for
vb/v0. We will use um to deﬁne

v0,m(ψ, ξ, vb, vm) ≡ vb/um.

(61)
The ratio v0,m/v0,g, which is also the ratio ug/um because
vb and vf are not altered by magnetic interactions, describes
how much more violently magnetized dust grains have to be
stirred for their collisions to be growth neutral; and hence how
much larger they can grow.

5.2.1. Exploring the consequences of magnetization on the

balance between sticking and fragmentation

The ratio v0,m/v0,g depends on too many parameters to
fully explore in this paper, but by restricting some of the pa-
rameters we can estimate the impact that magnetization has
on the dust grain size at which sticking and fragmentation are
balanced. Based on Equations (29), (44) and (55) we adopt

vb = 0.1 cm s−1 < vm (cid:28) vf = 100 cm s−1,

(62)

Figure 3. Top panel: Ratio of Equation (49), the large vc approximation for
¯Sm/Sg, to the actual value. Bottom panel: Ratio of Equation (54), the small
vc approximation for ¯Sm/Sg, to the actual value. Contours are 90%.
vb/v0 > 3; and that Equation (54) is a good approximation for
vb/v0 < 0.5.

5.2. Balancing sticking and fragmentation

In addition to bouncing, dust grains in protoplanetary disks

colliding at velocities

v > vf (cid:39) 100 cm s−1

(55)
will fragment (G¨uttler et al. 2010). This value for vf lies
well above our estimate for vm for magnetically soft grains
(Equations 29), but is comparable to the limiting value for
saturated magnetically hard grains (Equation 30). Including
magnetic forces could change this picture by allowing mag-
netic erosion (Hubbard 2014), but exploring that in detail is
far beyond the scope of this paper; and will require future ex-
perimental or numerical studies of high velocity encounters
between aggregates of monomers, some of which are mag-
netized. Further, mass transfer is a possibility when colliding
dust grains are very different in size, allowing for growth even
at high collision speeds (Windmark et al. 2012). For simplic-
ity, we nonetheless adopt the picture of Equation (55) for both
geometric and magnetized cases. Recall also that the colli-
sional velocity scale v0 is controlled by the dynamics of the
disk. We have assumed turbulent stirring, with v0 scaling with
the square root of the Stokes numbers of the dust grains (see
Equations 32 and 33).

At some critical collisional velocity scale, dust grain col-
lisions that result in sticking will balance those that result in

For our ﬁxed ξ = 103, Equations (64) and (67) can be solved
for ug and um (and hence v0,m/v0,g) as functions of ψ and
vm/vb. In Figure 4 we plot the ratio v0,m/v0,g, along with
the implied difference in Stokes number, for growth-neutral
grains. One immediate observation is that the equilibrium size
is only moderately shifted even when vm (cid:29) vb and magneti-
zation strongly increases the sticking rate. We can understand
this by taking the derivative of the fragmentation rate (i.e. the
right hand side of Equation 58) with respect to v0:

The exponential term in the fragmentation rate is an ex-
tremely sensitive function of velocity scale, so even signiﬁ-
cant changes in the sticking rate will be balanced by small
changes in the collisional velocity scale.

5.2.2. Saturated magnetization case

In the limiting case of magnetically hard grains magnetized
to saturation (Equation 30), we have vm ∼ vf , and mag-
netic interaction must in some fashion alter the critical col-
lisional velocity. We can estimate that if vm (cid:38) vf , where
vf is the fragmentation speed in the absence of magnetic in-
teractions, then the magnetic interactions allow grain survival
up to a magnetic-fragmentation speed vf m ∼ vm.
In that
case, we can use Equation (33) to estimate that the frag-
mentation limited dust grain size Stokes number scales as
St ∝ v2
m ∝ f1f2φ. In this limiting case, magnetic interactions
are expected to strongly alter the maximum size to which dust
grains grow.

5.2.3. Varying f

As noted above, while including magnetic interactions can
decrease the time it takes for grains to grow enough for stick-
ing and fragmentation to balance, the magnetic interactions
do not strongly change the grain size at which that balance
occurs. Accordingly, iron rich and iron poor grains will have
broadly similar sizes. Further, because we expect vm (cid:28) vf ,
the magnetic energy that helps hold iron rich grains together
is much smaller than the kinetic energy associated with frag-
mentation. Considerations of magnetic interactions are un-
likely to signiﬁcantly change vf .

Collisional fragmentation does not generally completely
destroy dust grains however, and it is possible that grains with

Figure 4. Top panel: Ratio of the turbulent collisional velocity scales re-
quired to balance sticking and fragmentation in the magnetized and non-
magnetized cases (the non-magnetized case does not depend on vm/vb). In
this ﬁgure we hold ξ ≡ vf /vb = 1000 ﬁxed, varying the magnetic velocity
vm and the growth-neutral sticking rate to fragmentation rate ratio ψ. Bot-
tom panel: Ratio of the Stokes numbers of magnetically interacting growth-
neutral grains to those of non-magnetically interacting growth-neutral grains

i.e. ξ = 103. Given this ratio between vb and vf we can
be certain that at least one of the limits vb (cid:28) v0 or vf (cid:29)
v0 holds, and accordingly that at least one of the sticking or
fragmentation rates is small. We will also assume that ψ, the
growth-neutral ratio of the sticking to fragmentation rates is
neither very large nor very small. Combining Equation (62)
with this condition on ψ implies that both the sticking and
fragmentation rates must be small, and we have

vb (cid:28) v0 (cid:28) vf ,
which allows signiﬁcant simpliﬁcations.
Because vb (cid:28) v0 we can use Equation (51) to rewrite Equa-

inhomogeneously distributed iron will fragment in a fashion
that preserves the iron rich portions. Indeed, the ﬂip side to
Equation (69) is that almost all fragmentation collisions occur
at velocities only a hair above vf , do not have a signiﬁcant
energy excess available, and must seek out the weakest links
binding collisionally grown aggregates together. This could
allow magnetic effects to play an outsized role in controlling
the results of the fragmentation process.

If so, and given the more rapid regrowth of iron rich dust
grains, this could not only delay the loss of primordial iron
metal inhomogeneities, but generate inhomogeneities in an
alternate version of magnetic erosion (Hubbard 2014). We
emphasis though that the difference in energy scales means
that such a process would suffer from a ﬁne-tuning problem.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We have examined the effect that magnetic dipole-dipole
interactions would have on dust-dust collisions. The strength
of the interaction can be parameterized in a single velocity
scale vm, the critical velocity below which magnetic forces
increase the effective collisional cross-section. Under the ap-
proximation of a Maxwellian large-separation dust-dust rel-
ative velocity distribution, appropriate for turbulently stirred
particles of strongly differing sizes, or for Brownian motion,
the inclusion of magnetic interactions can be reasonably sim-
ply encapsulated.

In general, collision rates are strongly enhanced if the mag-
netic velocity vm > v0, the scale of the Maxwellian veloc-
ity distribution. Further, if dust grain collisions lead to stick-
ing only below a characteristic velocity vb, magnetic interac-
tions strongly increase the sticking rate if either vm > v0 or
vm > vb is satisﬁed. Finally, if collisions above a character-
istic velocity vf lead to fragmentation, with vf > vm, then
the inclusion of magnetic interactions will increase the stick-
ing rate, but not the fragmentation rate, increasing the size of
growth-neutral dust grains whose sticking and fragmentation
rates are balanced. However, we ﬁnd that this ﬁnal effect is
relatively minor due to the exquisite sensitivity of the frag-
mentation rate to the Maxwellian velocity scale.

While the appropriate parameters are extremely uncertain,
and especially in the case of the relative magnetic perme-
ability µr could vary by orders of magnitude, we have es-
timated for vm in the case of dust in protoplanetary disks
whose iron metal component is magnetized by the ambient
magnetic ﬁeld. We ﬁnd that magnetic interactions are ex-
pected to play a signiﬁcant role in setting the dust-dust col-
lision rates at least at and inwards of the orbital position of
our asteroid belt, at least for the smaller grains. This means
that magnetic interactions must be considered for the initial
stages of dust coagulation, and dust chemistry, although the
implications at the chondrule precursor scale are less certain
Indeed, if pre-solar iron was carried into the solar nebula in
the form of single magnetic domains and therefor maximally
magnetized, magnetic interactions would play an overwhelm-
ing role. We hope that these results inspire laboratory stud-
ies to explore the magnetic properties of plausible pre-solar
iron-nickel bearing grains. Such studies would not only pro-
vide better estimates for µr, but would permit our model to be
generalized beyond perfectly magnetically soft and perfectly
magnetically hard dust grains.

Because vm depends on the iron metal fraction of the dust
grains, magnetic forces will help preserve primordial iron
metal inhomogeneities in the dust population of a protoplane-
tary disk, providing an explanation for the observed partition-
ing of iron between chondrules and matrix (Grossman & Was-

son 1982). If those iron metal inhomogeneities were corre-
lated with tungsten isotopic inhomogeneities, magnetic forces
could provide part of the puzzle for explaining the observa-
tions of Budde et al. (2015). Both cases also require that iron
content be correlated with the chondrule formation process.
We address this in a companion paper, Hubbard (2016), us-
ing a model where the weak dependency of equilibrium grain
size on magnetic interactions leads to iron rich grains being
less coupled. In that case, if chondrule formation events were
limited to occurring at altitude, iron rich grains would be con-
verted into chondrules at a slower rate than iron poor grains.
Note however that the energy scale of fragmentation is
much larger than that of the magnetic interactions in the mag-
netically soft case, so a signiﬁcant effect at the largest dust
size scale, where growth and fragmentation are balanced, is
only expected if magnetic forces help preserve iron rich por-
tions of fragmenting dust grains. Most of the collisions above
the critical fragmentation velocity vf are only just above that
velocity though, and so are not expected to have a large en-
ergy excess. Therefore it is plausible that magnetic effects
could play an outsized role in controlling the fragmentation
products, justifying future studies of high velocity impact be-
tween collisional aggregrates, some of whose components are
magnetized.
