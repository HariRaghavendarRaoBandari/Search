EMBEDDING OF THE RANK 1 DAHA INTO M at(2, Tq) AND ITS

AUTOMORPHISMS.

MARTA MAZZOCCO

Abstract. In this review paper we show how the Cherednik algebra of type
ˇC1C1 appears naturally as quantisation of the group algebra of the monodromy
group associated to the sixth Painlev´e equation. This fact naturally leads to
an embedding of the Cherednik algebra of type ˇC1C1 into M at(2, Tq), i.e. 2×2
matrices with entries in the quantum torus. For q = 1 this result is equivalent
to say that the Cherednik algebra of type ˇC1C1 is Azumaya of degree 2 [31]. By
quantising the action of the braid group and of the Okamoto transformations
on the monodromy group associated to the sixth Painlev´e equation we study
the automorphisms of the Cherednik algebra of type ˇC1C1 and conjecture the
existence of a new automorphism. Inspired by the conﬂuences of the Painlev´e
equations, we produce similar embeddings for the conﬂuent Cherednik algebras
HV , HIV , HIII , HII and HI , deﬁned in [27].

1. Introduction

The Painlev´e sixth equation [16, 33, 17] describes the monodromy preserving de-
formations of a rank 2 Fuchsian system with four simple poles a1, a2, a3 and ∞. The
solution of this Fuchsian system is in general a multi-valued analytic vector–function
in the punctured Riemann sphere P1 \{a1, a2, a3,∞} and its multivaluedness is de-
scribed by the so-called monodromy group, i.e. a subgroup of SL2(C) generated
by the images M1, M2, M3 of the generators of the fundamental group under the
anti-homomorphism:

ρ : π1(cid:0)P1\{a1, a2, a3,∞}, λ0(cid:1) → SL2(C).

In this paper, we introduce ﬂat coordinates on a large open sub-set of the set of
all possible monodromy groups obtained in this way (see Theorem 3.1). We then
obtain a quantisation of the group algebra of the monodromy group by introducing
a canonical quantisation for these ﬂat coordinates. This quantum algebra is iso-
morphic to the Cherednik algebra of type ˇC1C1, i.e. the algebra H generated by
four elements V0, V1, ˇV0, ˇV1 which satisfy the following relations [7, 32, 30, 34]:

As a consequence we obtain an embedding of the Cherednik algebra of type ˇC1C1

where k0, k1, u0, u1, q ∈ C⋆, such that qm 6= 1, m ∈ Z>0.

u0 = −i e−S1−S2−S3,

s = k0e−S1−S2 + k1e−S1+S3 + u1eS2+S3 + i e−S1−S2+S3 + i e−S1+S2+S3 − u0,

gives and embedding of H into M at(2, Tq). In particular, the images of V0, ˇV0, V1, ˇV1
in GL(2, Tq) satisfy the relations (1.1,. . . ,1.4) and (1.5), in the quantum ordering
is dictated by the matrix product ordering1.

Note that this result was already proved in [27] (using a diﬀerent presentation
for H). The purpose of the current paper is to explain this result in the Painlev´e
context and to draw parallels between the theory of the Painlev´e equations and the
theory of the Cherednik algebra of type ˇC1C1.

In particular, we prove that all the known automorphisms of the Cherednik alge-
bra of type ˇC1C1 are a quantisation of the action of the braid group on monodromy
matrices proposed in [9, 26] to describe the analytic continuation of the solutions
to the sixth Painlev´e equation.

Next we deal with the Okamoto transformations of the sixth Painlev´e equation
and their action on the monodromy group. By quantisation we conjecture the
existence of an automorphism of the Cherednik algebra of type ˇC1C1 which acts as
follows on the parameters:

(u1, u0, k1, k0) →(cid:18)

u1√u1u0k1k0

,

u0√u1u0k1k0

,

k1√u1u0k1k0

,

k0√u1u0k1k0(cid:19)

We postpone the computation of the action this automorphism on V0, V1, ˇV0, ˇV1 to
a subsequent publication.

Finally, in [27], the author introduced conﬂuent versions of the Cherednik alge-
bra of type ˇC1C1 by using a concatenation of Whittaker-type limits similar to those
introduced in [8]. In this paper we explain the origin of these conﬂuent Cherednik
algebras from the point of view of the Painlev´e theory. In [6] the conﬂuence scheme

1By this we mean that the product AB of two matrices A, B whose entries are in Tq is computed

by keeping the entries of A on the left matrix of the entries of B.

of the Painlev´e diﬀerential equations was explained in terms of certain geometric op-
erations giving rise to speciﬁc asymptotic limits in the classical coordinates s1, s2, s3
and parameters. Here, we quantise these asymptotic limits to obtain asymptotic
limits for the quantum coordinates S1, S2, S3 and of the parameters k0, k1, u0, u1
(see Fig. 1). By taking these limits in the matrices (1.6,. . . 1.9), we produce new
matrices which turn out to provide embeddings for the conﬂuent Cherednik algebras
HV ,HIV ,HIII ,HII and HI in M at(2, Tq).

We start by recalling without proof some very well known facts about the sixth

tions [22, 29].

the case when the parameters θ1, θ2, θ3 and θ∞ are not integers. This is just a technical restriction,
all the results proved in the paper are actually valid also when we lift such restriction.

The precise dependence of the matrices A1, A2, A3 on the PVI solution y(t) and its
ﬁrst derivative yt(t) can be found in [29].

The solution Φ(λ) of the system (2.12) is a multi-valued analytic function in the
punctured Riemann sphere P1 \{a1, a2, a3,∞} and its multivaluedness is described
by the so-called monodromy matrices, i.e.
the images of the generators of the
fundamental group under the anti-homomorphism

ρ : π1(cid:0)P1\{a1, a2, a3,∞}, λ0(cid:1) → SL2(C).

In this paper we ﬁx the base point λ0 at inﬁnity and the generators of the funda-
mental group to be l1, l2, l3, where each li, i = 1, 2, 3, encircles only the pole ai once
and l1, l2, l3 are oriented in such a way that

(2.15)

M1M2M3M∞ = 11,

where M∞ = exp(2πiA∞).

2.2. Riemann-Hilbert correspondence and monodromy manifold. Let us
denote by F (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ∞) the moduli space of rank 2 meromorphic connection over
P1 with four simple poles a1, a2, a3,∞ of the form (2.12). Let M(G1, G2, G3, G∞)
denote the moduli of monodromy representations ρ up to Jordan equivalence, with
the local monodromy data of Gi’s prescribed by

Gi := Tr(Mi) = 2 cos(πθi),

Then the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence

i = 1, 2, 3,∞.

F (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ∞)/Γ → M(G1, G2, G3, G∞)/GL2(C),

where Γ is the gauge group [2], is deﬁned by associating to each Fuchsian system
its monodromy representation class. The representation space M(G1, G2, G3, G∞)/
GL2(C) is realised as an aﬃne cubic surface (see [21])

and

Gij = Tr (MiMj) ,

i, j = 1, 2, 3,

ωij := GiGj + GkG∞,

This cubic surface is called monodromy manifold of the sixth Painlev´e equation and
it is equipped with the following Poisson bracket:

k 6= i, j,

0 + G2

t + G2

ω∞ = G2

(2.17)

{G12, G23} = G12G23 + 2G31 − ω2
{G23, G31} = G23G31 + 2G12 − ω3
{G31, G12} = G31G12 + 2G23 − ω1

In [20], Iwasaki proved that the triple (G12, G23, G31) satisfying the cubic relation
(2.16) provides a set of coordinates on a large open subset S ⊂ M(G1, G2, G3, G∞).
In the following sub-section, we restrict to such open set.

Figure 2. The fat graph of the 4 holed Riemann sphere. The

2.3. Teichm¨uller theory of the 4-holed Riemann sphere. The real slice of
moduli space F (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ∞) of rank 2 meromorphic connections over P1 with four
simple poles a1, a2, a3,∞ can be obtained as a quotient of the Teichm¨uller space
of the 4–holed Riemann sphere by the mapping class group. This fact allowed
us to use the combinatorial description of the Teichm¨uller space of the 4–holed
Riemann sphere in terms of fat-graphs to produce a good parameterisation of the
monodromy manifold of PVI [4]. In this sub-section we recall the main ingredients
of this construction.

We recall that according to Fock [13] [14], the fat graph associated to a Riemann
surface Σg,n of genus g and with n holes is a connected three–valent graph drawn
without self-intersections on Σg,n with a prescribed cyclic ordering of labelled edges
entering each vertex; it must be a maximal graph in the sense that its complement
on the Riemann surface is a set of disjoint polygons (faces), each polygon containing
exactly one hole (and becoming simply connected after gluing this hole). In the
case of a Riemann sphere Σ0,4 with 4 holes, the fat–graph is represented in Fig.2
(the fourth hole is the outside of the graph).

The geodesic length functions, which are traces of hyperbolic elements in the

Fuchsian group ∆g,n such that in Poincar´e uniformisation:

Σg,n ∼ H/∆g,n,

are obtained by decomposing each hyperbolic matrix γ ∈ ∆g,n into a product of
the so–called right, left and edge matrices: [13] [14]

Let us consider the closed geodesics γij encircling the i-th and j-th holes without
self intersections (for example γ12 is drawn in Fig.1), then their geodesic length
functions can be obtained as:

(2.18)

G23 = −Tr (REs2REp2 REs2 REs3 REp3 REs3R) ,
G31 = −Tr (LEs3REp3 REs3 REs1 REp1REs1 ) ,
G12 = −Tr (Es1 REp1REs1 REs2 REp2 REs2 L) ,

Due to the classical result that each conjugacy class in the fundamental group
P1 \ {a1, a2, a3,∞} can be represented by a unique closed geodesic, we can make
the following identiﬁcation:

(2.20)

Gij := Tr (MiMj) ,

and indeed it is a straightforward computation to show that G12, G23, G31 deﬁned
as in (2.19) indeed lie on the cubic (2.16).

Moreover, the Poisson algebra structure (2.17) is induced by the Poisson algebras
of geodesic length functions constructed in [3] by postulating the Poisson relations
on the level of the shear coordinates sα of the Teichm¨uller space. In our case these
are:

{s1, s2} = {s2, s3} = {s3, s1} = 1,
while the perimeters p1, p2, p3 are assumed to be Casimirs.

Since the parameterisation (2.19) is analytic in s1, s2, s3, we can complexify
s1, s2, s3 and G1, G2, G3, G∞ to claim that s1, s2, s3 ∈ C provide a system of ﬂat
coordinates on the Friecke cubic (2.16).

2.4. Parameterisation of the monodromy group. In the case of monodromy
matrices, Korotkin and Samtleben in [25] proposed an r-matrix structure of the
Fock–Rosly type [15] which did not however satisfy Jacobi relations on monodromy
matrices themselves but became consistent on the level of adjoint invariant ele-
ments. Therefore the problem of quantising the monodromy group remained open.
In this section we show that thanks to the identiﬁcation (2.20), we can impose

(2.21)

M1 = Es1 REp1REs1 ,
M2 = −REs2 REp2 REs2 L,
M3 = −LEs3 REp3REs3 R,

so that s1, s2, s3 ∈ C provide a system of ﬂat coordinates on the monodromy group,
rather than only the monodromy manifold. This will allow as to quantise as we
shall see in subsection 3.
Theorem 2.1. Given any quadruple of diagonalisable matrices M1, M2, M3, M∞ ∈
SL2(C), such that M1M2M3M∞ = I, the group hM1, M2, M3i is irreducible and
none of the matrices M1, M2, M3, M∞ is a multiple of the identity, we can ﬁnd
s1, s2, s3, p1, p2, , p3 ∈ C such that the following relations hold true (up to global
conjugation and cyclic permutation):

3. Quantisation

In [5] the proper quantum ordering for a special class of geodesic functions cor-
responding to geodesics going around exactly two holes was constructed and it was
proved that for each such geodesic, the matrix entries of the corresponding ele-
ment in the Fuchsian group satisfy a deformed version of the quantum universal
enveloping algebra Uq(sl2) relations.

In this section we use the same quantum ordering for quantising matrix elements

of the monodromy group.

In [4], the quantum Painlev´e cubic can be obtained by introducing the Hermitian
operators S1, S2, S3 subject to the commutation inherited from the Poisson bracket
of si:

[Si, Si+1] = iπ{si, si+1} = iπ,

i = 1, 2, 3, i + 3 ≡ i,

This theorem shows that we can interpret the Cherednik algebra as quantisation
of the group algebra of the monodromy group of the sixth Painlev´e equation, in
fact the matrices deﬁned by (1.6), (1.7), (1.8), (1.9) are simply obtained as iM 

iM 

Theorem 3.2. The map:

where M 

M at(2, Tq). In other words, the matrices iM 

satisfy the relations (1.1,1.2,1.3) and (1.4), in which the quantum ordering is dic-
tated by the matrix product ordering and

4. Classical limit of the automorphisms of the Cherednik algebra

In [9] the following action of the braid group on monodromy matrices was pro-
posed to describe the analytic continuation of solutions to the sixth Painlev´e equa-
tion:

(4.32)

β1(M1, M2, M3, M∞) = (M1M2M −1
β2(M1, M2, M3, M∞) = (M1, M2M3M −1

1 , M1, M3, M∞),
2 , M2, M∞).

In [26], this action was expended by adding the following involution:

(4.33)

r(M1, M2, M3, M∞) = (M −1

3 , M −1

2 , M −1

1 , M −1

∞ ).

In this section we prove that this extended braid group action gives rise to the
automorphisms of the Cherednik algebra of type ˇC1C1 which were studied in [30,
34]. Here we list them as they appear in [31]:

(4.34)

(4.35)

(4.36)

(4.37)

σ( ˇV1, V1, V0, ˇV0) = (V0, V1, V −1

ˇV1V1, V0 ˇV0V −1

),

τ ( ˇV1, V1, V0, ˇV0) = ( ˇV1, V1, V0 ˇV0V −1

),

π( ˇV1, V1, V0, ˇV0) = ( ˇV0, ˇV1, V1, V0).

Indeed by quantising (4.32) and (4.33) we obtain

−1

1 ( ˇV1, V1, V0, ˇV0) = ( ˇV1V1 ˇV1
β 
2 ( ˇV1, V1, V0, ˇV0) = ( ˇV1, V1V0V −1

, ˇV1

, ˇV1, V0, ˇV0),
, V1, ˇV0),
−1
, ˇV −1

, V −1

).

It is not hard to check that σ = β
2 , so that
we can claim that the automorphisms of the Cherednik algebra of type ˇC1C1 are
indeed the quantisation of the extended modular group action described in [9, 26].
The Painlev´e sixth equation admits also an aﬃne group of bi-rational transfor-

We note that w1, w2, w3, w∞ have no eﬀect on the monodromy matrices and
therefore on the generators of H, while r1, r2, r3 act as combinations of cyclic permu-
tations and the transformation r, while the permutations π13, π1∞, π12 correspond
to a simple re-labelling of the parameters. The only transformation which does not
have a simple explanation in terms of monodromy matrices M1, M2, M3, M∞ is wρ,
which was explained in terms of isomonodromic deformations of a 3 × 3 linear sys-
tem with one irregular singularity and one simple pole in [28]. On the parameters
(u1, u0, k1, k0) this transformation acts as follows:

(u1, u0, k1, k0) →(cid:18)

u1√u1u0k1k0

,

u0√u1u0k1k0

,

k1√u1u0k1k0

,

k0√u1u0k1k0(cid:19)

We postpone the computation of the action this automorphism on V0, V1, ˇV0, ˇV1
to a subsequent publication, this will involve a quantum version of the middle
convolution operation discussed in [12].

5. Embedding of the confluent Cherednik algebras into M at(2, Tq)
The conﬂuent limits of the Cherednik algebra of type ˇC1C1 were introduced in
[27], in terms of a diﬀerent presentation which is equivalent to the following (see
Theorem 3.2 in [27]):
Deﬁnition 5.1. Let k1, u0, u1, q ∈ C⋆, such that qm 6= 1, m ∈ Z>0. The conﬂu-
ent Cherednik algebras HV ,HIV ,HIII ,HII ,HI are the algebras generated by four
elements V0, V1, ˇV0, ˇV1 satisfying the following relations respectively:

All these algebras HV ,HIV ,HIII ,HII ,HI admit embeddings in M at(2, Tq) (see
Theorems 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.5 in [27]). Here we report these embeddings for
the generators ˇV1, V1, V0, ˇV0 in order to clarify the conﬂuence scheme in accordance
with Figure 1. Note that in Figure 1, we also have the algebras HD7

III and HD8

which we don’t have a Noumi Stokman [30] representation and for which we can’t
prove the embedding into M at(2, Tq), so that the geometric explanation behind
these algebras remains conjectural.
