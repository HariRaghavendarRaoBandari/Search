ABSTRACT
We study the stochastic variation of blazar emission under a 2-D spatially resolved leptonic
jet model we previously developed. Random events of particle acceleration and injection in
small zones within the emission region are assumed to be responsible for ﬂux variations. In
addition to producing spectral energy distributions that describe the observed ﬂux of Mrk 421,
we further analyze the timing properties of the simulated light curves, such as the power spec-
tral density (PSD) at different bands, ﬂux-ﬂux correlations, as well as the cross-correlation
function between X-rays and TeV γ-rays. We ﬁnd spectral breaks in the PSD at a timescale
comparable to the dominant characteristic time scale in the system, which is usually the pre-
deﬁned decay time scale of an acceleration event. Cooling imposes a delay, and so PSDs
taken at lower energy bands in each emission component (synchrotron or inverse Compton)
generally break at longer timescales. The ﬂux-ﬂux correlation between X-rays and TeV γ-rays
can be either quadratic or linear, depending on whether or not there are large variation of the
injection into the particle acceleration process. When the relationship is quadratic, the TeV
ﬂares lag the X-ray ﬂares, and the optical & GeV ﬂares are large enough to be comparable to
the ones in X-ray. When the relationship is linear, the lags are insigniﬁcant, and the optical &
GeV ﬂares are small.

1 INTRODUCTION

Blazars are a special group of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
whose observed radiation is dominated by relativistic jets. They
show erratic variability at almost all electromagnetic wavelengths
(Ulrich et al. 1997). The most extreme variations are observed in
γ-rays, where amplitudes can be as large as a factor of 50 (e.g.
Acciari et al. 2014), and the doubling time of the ﬂux can be
as short as 3 minutes (Aharonian et al. 2007). Variability in dif-
ferent wavebands is usually correlated (e.g. Fossati et al. 2008;
Chatterjee et al. 2008) with notable exceptions (Krawczynski et al.
2004; Aharonian et al. 2009b). Because most of the blazar emis-
sion comes from non-thermal radiation of plasma in the relativis-
tic jets that moves in a direction highly aligned with our line of
sight, strong relativistic beaming effects alter the temporal and
spectral features of the emission (Urry & Padovani 1995), con-
tributing to the violent variability of blazars. For example, it can
shorten the timescales of the variations, and make them appear

much faster than the intrinsic variation timescales in the jets’ co-
moving frame. But even with this considered, signiﬁcant variability
on the timescale of several minutes is still not readily explained for
jets with sizes presumably larger than the Schwarzschild radii of the
black holes (Aharonian et al. 2007). In fact, most of those extreme
temporal features observed in blazars are still yet to be understood.

The rich information carried within time-series data may
also provide vital clues for the discrimination of currently dege-
narate emission models, namely the leptonic and hadronic mod-
els of high-energy emission (B¨ottcher et al. 2013). The former can
be further classiﬁed into synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) mod-
els (Maraschi et al. 1992) and external Compton (EC) models
(Dermer et al. 1992; Ghisellini & Madau 1996; Sikora et al. 2009),
while the latter consists of proton synchrotron (M¨ucke & Protheroe
2001), p-p pion production (Pohl & Schlickeiser 2000), and p-γ
pion production (Mannheim & Biermann 1992; Mannheim 1993)
models. Furthermore, detailed time-dependent modeling of the
blazar jets can help constrain the physical conditions such as
emission location, magnetic ﬁeld, size, and even composition of

2

the jets (Petropoulou 2014; Diltz et al. 2015; Sokolov et al. 2004;
Zacharias & Schlickeiser 2013).

Time-dependent modeling of blazars usually refers

to
well deﬁned, ’clean’ ﬂares (Saito et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2011;
Zhang et al. 2015), because only in those cases can one easily iden-
tify a single physical event that may possibly reproduce the obser-
vation. However, there is no guarantee that such clean ﬂares are
representative of the general behavior of blazar variability. In fact,
clean ﬂares with predictable raising and decaying phases are rela-
tively rare (Nalewajko 2013). Most of the light curve may be bet-
ter described as a succession of ﬂares that overlap each other, if
one insists on describing light curves with ﬂares (Aharonian et al.
2007; Abdo et al. 2010b). An alternative approach is to continu-
ously change one or more parameters in the model so that the re-
sulting light curves match an entire observation campaign in at least
one waveband (Krawczynski et al. 2002). This approach keeps the
modeling close to observation and provides a good way to probe the
underlying physical connection between the variations at different
wavebands. However, it does not offer any physical reasoning why
the physical parameters change in the way the ﬁtting process re-
quires them, as the timing information contained in the primarily
ﬁtted wavelength is largely left unexplored.

The noise-like appearance of blazar light curves triggered in-
terests in their power spectral density (PSD), which can reveal
the distribution of ﬂux variability on different timescales (e.g.
Chatterjee et al. 2008; Abdo et al. 2010a). Studies show that blazar
PSDs typically exhibit a featureless power-law spectrum close to an
1/f 2 red-noise proﬁle. However, the range of timescales covered
in those studies is usually limited, because it is naturally difﬁcult
to collect time-series data over vastly different timescales. There-
fore it is entirely possible that there are PSD spectral breaks that
can not yet be robustly identiﬁed from the currently available data.
For example, Kataoka et al. (2001) analyzed the 0.5-10 keV X-ray
variability of Mrk 421, and the results suggested a break of the PSD
indices around 10−5 Hz, close to the longest time scale accessible
with their data. A more recent analysis of 3-10 keV X-ray variabil-
ity on longer time scales (Isobe et al. 2015) conﬁrms a relatively
soft PSD index of 1.6, although that is much harder than predicted
by Kataoka et al. (2001).

The randomness in the blazar behavior prompted attempts
to treat the blazar physics as stochastic processes, either using
the internal shock models (Spada et al. 2001; Guetta et al. 2004;
Rachen et al. 2010) or turbulence (Marscher 2014) to explain
blazar variability. With these approaches, it is practically impossi-
ble to match observed and simulated light curves, because the vari-
ation of the simulated ﬂux at any particular time is random. How-
ever, the ﬂuctuations obey certain probability distributions, so that
over a long time, the light curves would produce predictable PSDs.
Those PSDs, as simulation products, can be directly compared with
the PSDs obtained from past or future observations. Additionally,
the correlation between different wavebands remains very infor-
mative of the inherent physical processes. The traditional ﬁtting of
blazar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) will also be available
just as in steady-state or time-dependent approaches. Combining
all this information, one can take advantage of the large amount
of multiwavelength data available and place strong constraints on
blazar models.

In Chen et al. (2015) (Paper I hereafter), we have built an in-
homogeneous jet-emission model. As an initial step towards a more
comprehensive model, we studied the spectral properties of the
system as it relaxes to its steady state. In this work we will ex-
pand that model by introducing stochastic processes, building time-

dependent SEDs and simulating light curves to be compared with
observations. The aim is to identify distinctive timing features, that
can be used to explain observed variability and guide future obser-
vation or data analysis.

In this paper, all quantities in the comoving frame of the jet
are primed, while quantities in the observer’s frame are unprimed.
Notice that this is contrary to the convention in Paper I, because in
that work most of the discussions are focused on particle processes
in the comoving frame, while in this work the focus is shifted to
observational consequences.

2 STOCHASTIC PROCESSES AND PSDS

The PSD of evenly spaced time-series data can be calculated conve-
niently. For the ease of comparison with observations, we use the
formula of Uttley et al. (2002) and Chatterjee et al. (2008) to cal-
culate PSDs from observational light curves of blazars. First, the
average ﬂux is subtracted off all ﬂux points in a light curve, yield-
ing

f (ti) = F (ti) −

= F (ti) − µ .

where

Here, T is the total duration of the light curves considered, N
is the total number of data points, and µ is the average ﬂux sub-
tracted. Eq. 3 calculates the square of the modulus of the discrete
Fourier transform for the light curves at linearly evenly sampled
frequencies i/T , where i are integers between 1 and N/2. Eq. 2
gives the fractional rms-squared normalization to the ﬁnal PSD.

With the fractional rms-squared normalization used in Eq. 2,
the PSDs have the property that the integral of the PSDs give the
total fractional rms variability of the light curve. They give a direct
view of how variable the emission is at different time scales. Of
special interest are the slopes of the PSDs, which may reveal key
properties of the underlying stochastic process.

In the context of discrete time series, white noise results from
perhaps the most simple stochastic process. It consists of a se-
quence of random variables that are independent of each other. The
PSD of white noise has slope zero, i.e. the power per unit frequency
is uniformly distributed on all time scales.

If the signal from one time step persist to the next time step,
and the random variable is allowed to accumulate, then the resulting
time series becomes red noise. This stochastic process is a random
walk process. The continous-time limit of a Gaussian random walk
in one-dimension is called the Wiener process, which also produces
red noise. The PSD of red noise has slope -2, with more variabiliy
power per unit frequency distributed at large time scales.

Some further modiﬁcation of the Wiener process can also al-
low for breaks in the slope of PSDs. One such modiﬁed process is
the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process. It allows the accumulated
signal in the Wiener process to exponentially decrease with time,

Diffusion-Acceleration in Jets: Stochastic Variation

on time scale τ , e.g. imposed by particles escape/cooling or turbu-
lence decay. This decrease means that at the extreme of large time
scales, the earlier signal almost vanishes (acceleration events de-
cay), and the signal approaches white noise; at the extreme of small
time scales, the signal does not have enough time to decrease (ac-
celeration events accumulate), and the process approaches a Wiener
process. The PSD slope changes from 0 at large time scale to -2
at small time scale. The slope breaks approximately at frequency
1/(2πτ ). An analytical expression for the PSD of an O-U process
exists (Kelly et al. 2009):

P (ν) =

2σ2τ 2

1 + (2πτ ν)2 .

(4)

Here σ is related to the strength of the O-U process, and is only rel-
evant to the normalization of the PSD. For a mathematical descrip-
tion of the O-U process, we refer the readers to Gillespie (1996).

As a mathematical model that motivates the implementation of
stochastic variations in our jet model, we simulate a slightly mod-
iﬁed version of the O-U process where instead of Gaussian distri-
bution, the increment follows the Bernoulli distribution, i.e. it takes
value of 1 with probability Pon, and takes 0 otherwise. The incre-
ment is only active on certain time steps with separation of ∆Ton,

which is, for example, 103∆t. Here ∆t is the time step, as well as
the unit of time in these simulations. There is no extra input, i.e.
the increment remains 0, on other time steps. The simulations last
6000 time steps each.

The simulated time sequence is used to produce PSDs accord-
ing to eq. 1-3. The resulting ∼ 106 PSD points are grouped into 19
bins, where the bins have the same width on the logarithmic scale
in the frequency axis (x-axis of the plot). The points shown in Fig-
ure 1 represent the average values from each bin. Three plots are
shown in a column to illustrate the effects of changing the incre-
ments separation, ∆Ton, and the success probability, Pon.

We can see that in all these plots, above the frequency deﬁned
by 1/(2πτ ), the PSDs are compatible with red noise, whereas be-
low the break frequency they are consistent with white noise. This
is the expected characteristic of the O-U process. We ﬁt eq. 4 to
the simulated PSDs by allowing both parameters σ and τ to vary.
In practice, the logarithm of P (ν) is used for the ﬁtting to avoid
dominance of the high-power points at low frequency.

Also shown in Figure 1 is that the ﬁtted ˆτ is always very close
to the actual τ in the model. This shows that the break in the PSD is
solely determined by the decay time scale, while not being affected
by the parameters ∆Ton or Pon, as shown in the middle and bottom
panels of Fig.1.

3 MODEL SETUP

The model used in this work is built upon the spatially resolved
treatment of particle acceleration and diffusion in jets that is pre-
sented in Paper I, where the discussion focused on the steady-state
spectrum. The particle transport equation used in the model reads
as

where n′(γ ′, r

˙γ ′(γ ′, r
′, t′) is the acceleration rate ( including the synchrotron and
′, t′) is the momentum
SSC cooling, which are negative), D′(γ ′, r
x(γ ′) is the spatial diffusion coefﬁcient,
diffusion coefﬁcient, D′
′, t′) is the particle injection rate. Further explanation
and Q′(γ ′, r
of this equation, along with a schematic ﬁgure for the geometry
can be found in Paper I. A more detailed description of the Monte
Carlo/Fokker-Planck (MCFP) code used for building the model can
be found in Chen et al. (2011). In the current work we adopt the
Dirichlet boundary conditions (n′
boundary = 0), i.e. the spatial dif-
fusion will lead to particle escape through the outer boundary of the
simulation box. The Monte-Carlo photons in the simulation output
are binned according to the angle of their traveling direction to the
jet axis, θ′. In order to get sufﬁcient number of Monte Carlo pho-
tons for the bin that has Doppler factor δ ∼ Γ, we sample a ﬁnite
range of θ′ around 90◦ in the jet frame (−0.12 6 cosθ′ 6 0.12
here). But the relativistic beaming is performed using the average
angle (cosθ′ = 0) to avoid any spread in the Doppler factor for
the beaming, which can cause signiﬁcant spread of the ﬂux in time
when the simulation becomes relatively long. The cylindrical sim-
ulation box is divided into axisymmetrical ring-like cells in radial
and vertical directions. The number of cells is nz×nr=20×15=300.

The magnetic ﬁeld is assumed to be homogeneous and disordered,
so that the spatial diffusion is also isotropic. The radiation mech-
anism is assumed to be leptonic, with current discussions limited
to SSC models, even though our MCFP code also allows for the
study of EC models (Chen et al. 2012). The simulated results (§ 4)
including SEDs, light curves and ﬂux-ﬂux correlations are plotted
together with the observations of Mrk 421, the stereotypical high-
energy-peak blazar that we try to compare our simulations with.
This matching to Mrk 421 also inﬂuences our discussions, many
of which, especially the energy bands, may appear to be speciﬁc
to Mrk 421. However, most of the results are indeed applicable to
other blazars, especially other high synchrotron peak blazars. The
key parameters used in the benchmark case (§ 4.1) are listed in Ta-
ble 1.

In order to achieve a stochastic increase of localized acceler-
ation, which we use to describe the turbulent nature of the plasma,
we set the acceleration rate in each cell in a way similar to the
stochastic process we simulated in §2. The speciﬁc implementa-
tions of the O-U-process-like acceleration in our jet-model is as
follows: In most parts of the emission region, the particles are
assumed to only diffuse spatially and cool radiatively, i.e. there
is no acceleration. This assumption is broken in a spinal region
along the axis of the axisymmetrical jet (where the radius r′ <
1015cm), where second-order Fermi acceleration with acceleration
rate ˙γ ′
acc is at work. Initially, the acceleration
D(γ ′, r
time, t′
acc, is very long. Within this region, for every time step
(δt′ = δz ′/c = 1.7 × 104 s here), each sub-region with 2x2 cells
may experience with a probability of Pacc (=0.07 here) an increase
in the acceleration rate. The increment in acceleration rate is

(6)

These increase can happen repeatedly on the same cells. Sub-
regions can overlap with each other in the z direction, so that each
cell belongs to two sub-regions and has two chances of receiving
additional acceleration every time step. On the other hand, the ac-
celeration rates also decrease exponentially on the time scale τ ′
decay
all the time, everywhere. The stochastic increase of the acceleration
represents additional turbulence caused by, e.g., magnetic recon-
nection, or other plasma processes that are inherently stochastic.
The deterministic decrease on the other hand represents the dissi-
pation of these magnetic turbulence through reconnection.

Most of the speciﬁc parameter values used in this section are
tuned so that the simulated and observed SED and light curves look
reasonably similar. However, as demonstrated in the previous sec-
tion, the choice of the parameters like time-step and Pacc does not
affect key features such as the power-law breaks in the PSDs.

One important complication in our model is that here the ran-
dom variable is the acceleration rate, rather than the radiative ﬂux
that is measured directly. Because of this, several time scales be-
sides the acceleration decay time scale become potentially relevant

in the problem. Those include the radiative-cooling time scale and
light-crossing time scale. We will further compare our simulation
results with the O-U process, and discuss the relevance of different
time scales in § 4 & 5.

In the acceleration regions, electrons are also injected at rela-
tively low, but still highly relativistic energy. Instead of following
a Gaussian distribution as assumed in Paper I, these electrons fol-
low the Maxwell-J¨uttner distribution (Wienke 1975; J¨uttner 1911)
expressed as a function of Lorentz factor γ ′:

where K2 is a modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind, Θ′ is
associated to the temperature T as Θ′ = kT ′/mc2, k is Boltz-
mann’s constant, m is the rest mass of the particle (electron here),
β ′ = v′/c, and c is the speed of light. Θ′ is chosen to equal the bulk
Lorentz factor of the jet Γ, because the injected electrons are postu-
lated as a result of particles in the interstellar medium being trapped
and isotropized by the magnetic turbulence which also causes the
particle acceleration in the jet. This is similar to the isotropization
of particles of the interstellar medium through blast waves as pro-
posed by Pohl & Schlickeiser (2000).

An illustrative example of the 2-D energy-density maps of
electrons in the simulation (Case 1) is plotted in Fig. 2. The cor-
responding electron energy distributions averaged over the entire
emission region are plotted in Fig. 3. Both ﬁgures use quantities in
the co-moving jet frame. To be noted from the ﬁgures are the asym-
metry in the spatial distribution of electrons and the spectral impact
of the stochasticity in acceleration efﬁciency.

Microphysical processes that provide an enhanced level of tur-
bulence, and hence stronger stochastic acceleration, often go along
with preacceleration of particles that subsequently undergo Fermi-
type acceleration. To avoid specifying the origin of fast stochas-
tic acceleration, we investigate two representative scenarios. In the
benchmark case, shown in § 4.1, the rate of particle injection at low
energy, non-zero only in the acceleration region, is exponentially
coupled to the acceleration rate according to

Q′

inj = Q′

acc),

(8)

acceleration. The injection is then exponentially associated with the
peak energy of the background particles, and so is the acceleration
rate. Table 1 lists the fastest injection rate we observed in the simu-
lation.

The connection between injection and acceleration is changed
in the second case (§ 4.2, representing the alternative scenario),
where injection is absent where the acceleration is slow (t′
acc ≫
Z ′/c). When the acceleration rate is reasonably strong (t′
acc ∼
acc < Z ′/c), the injection rate is set to a constant
Z ′/c or t′
(Q′
inj = 4 × 10−3 cm−2 s−1). Effectively, this leads to a constant
particle density of 1.49 cm−3.

Under the same physical scenario as the one in the benchmark
case, we investigate a third case, as outlined in § 4.3. This case
explores the effects of the acceleration decay rate, by changing
decay from 2Z/c to 4Z/c. To ensure the maximum acceleration
τ ′
rate achieved is more or less unchanged, we accordingly reduce in
amplitude the stochastic increments of the acceleration.

Most simulations (except the duplicate simulation for Fig. 6)
in this work use the same sequence of random numbers for the
stochastic change of the acceleration rate (but not for the Monte
Carlo radiative transfer). This is evident from the similar light
curves seen in all cases. This makes the comparison between dif-
ferent cases easier, and leaves the intended change of condition in
the system as the most likely cause for any differences.

4 RESULTS

Since we have multiple cases, each with a similar set of analyses
that would be better understood when compared with each other,
we merely list the ﬁndings of each case and the variability analysis
methods in this section, and leave the interpretation of these ﬁnd-
ings to §5. The SEDs and light curves are not the focus of our study
in this work. The simulated observational SEDs and light curves
for each case are shown here to verify that we are using model
parameters that are generally consistent with what we know about
Mrk 421.

4.1 Case 1: Injection associated with acceleration

This is the benchmark simulation case for our study. The SED and
light curve samples are shown in Fig 4. The conversion between
apparent luminosity and ﬂux is performed for 135 Mpc as the lu-
minosity distance of Mrk 421. Since the results are under the in-
ﬂuence of stochastic ﬂuctuations, we only aim to approximately
match the simulated SEDs with the observation. Likewise, the sim-
ulated and observational light curves cannot be identical. They are
shown to demonstrate that they generally have similar shapes and
amplitudes. The ﬁrst 100 ks of the simulated light curves include
the initial build up of the photon ﬁeld and the stabilization of the
electron energy distribution. We do not consider this period in sub-
sequent analysis to avoid any unwanted effects from the initial con-
dition.

0 = 10−7 cm−2 s−1 and t′

where Q′
0 = 2.16 Z ′/c. These values
are tuned so that the changes in both acceleration and injection af-
fect the evolution of the light curves. The motivation for the expo-
nential coupling used here is: Suppose the injection is linearly as-
sociated with the high-energy tail of a background particle popula-
tion, which falls off exponentially; and suppose the pre-acceleration
of the background particles is linearly associated with the localized

4.1.1 Power Spectral Density

In our simulations, the total duration T of equation 2 is 3000 ks mi-
nus the ﬁrst 100 ks, which is considered the setup phase of the sim-
ulations. The PSD points are further binned into 20 logarithmically
evenly spaced frequency bins from 8.8 × 10−7 Hz to 5.9 × 10−4
Hz. The ﬁrst two points are exempt from binning because of the

sparseness of points at those frequencies, making 22 the total num-
ber of ﬁnal PSD points for each energy.

The resulting PSD for the entire simulation (excluding the ﬁrst
100 ks) is shown in Fig.5 together with the full light curves. The
PSDs therefore show that the high-energy X-ray ﬂux is most vari-
able within the synchrotron component. Within the inverse Comp-
ton (IC) component at higher energy, the GeV γ-ray and TeV γ-ray
have similar level of variability.

The PSDs follow a broken power-law distribution, which is
expected from O-U processes. However, the non-smoothness of
the PSDs at low frequency indicates considerable uncertainty. This
might hamper our identiﬁcation of the breaks. In order to increase
the reliability of the PSDs, we repeated the simulation leading to
Fig. 5 with a different sequence of random numbers. The PSD of
this separate simulation is shown in the left panel of Fig. 6. An av-
erage of the PSDs from the two simulations is shown in the right
panel of Fig. 6.

Apart from the red/white noise above/below the break fre-
quency, the PSDs also ﬂatten to white noise at the highest fre-
quencies. This is a natural result of the uncertainty in the Monte
Carlo method used for the radiative transfer, which renders unreli-

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

able variability below certain threshold. This is also a great example
that shows how the PSD can be used to identify at which time scales
and amplitudes the variability in a light curve should be suspected
of containing mostly noise.

We ﬁt the average PSDs of the two simulations with equation
4. Only frequencies below 10−4 Hz are considered in the ﬁtting,
in order to avoid the white noise at low variation power caused by
Monte-Carlo ﬂuctuation. The best-ﬁt relaxation times, τrelax, are
listed in Table 2. We can see that for both the synchrotron and IC
emission, τrelax becomes smaller with increasing photon energy.
For the X-ray synchrotron bands, τrelax is close to both the accel-
eration decay time, τ ′
decay/Γ = 20 ks, and the light crossing time,
cross/Γ = 10 ks.
τ ′

4.1.2 X-ray/γ-ray Correlation

We show the ﬂux-ﬂux amplitude correlation and the cross-
correlation function for the benchmark case in Fig. 7.

In order to obtain the uncertainty of the cross-correlation, we
resample one of the two light curves without replacement, i.e. the
time series of the light curve is reshufﬂed randomly. Then we calcu-
late the correlation value of this reshufﬂed light curve with the other
light curve, with zero lag. Since now the two light curves should
be completely uncorrelated, the expected correlation is zero. Any
non-zero values are assumed to be caused by random ﬂuctuations
around zero. By repeating this process for 2000 times, we get 2000
different cross-correlation values. The standard deviation, σcc, for
those 2000 values is taken as the uncertainty of the correlation. We
use the maximum of the correlation in Fig. 7 minus σcc to set the
conﬁdence interval for the lag based on the correlation function,
while the estimated time lag is the mid-point of this interval. For
the purpose of maximizing the precision of the lags detected, we
use 0.2-ks time bins instead of the 1-ks bins used in the other plots.

Figure 7. Correlation analysis for Case 1. Left: Flux-ﬂux correlation between the X-ray and γ-ray bands during the time period 1200ks-1500ks. The ﬁrst
30 ks are plotted in red, and the last 30 ks are plotted in cyan. The grey connected circles are observational data points for Mrk 421 on March 19, 2001
from Fossati et al. (2008). Three grey dashed lines are also plotted so that the readers can compare them to the trend of the ﬂux-ﬂux relationship. Right:
Cross-correlation between X-ray and TeV γ-ray ﬂuxes based on the light curves, excluding the ﬁrst 100 ks. The conﬁdence interval for the lag based on the
correlation function is marked with the horizontal solid blue line, while the estimated lag is identiﬁed with the dashed blue vertical line.

This choice still makes sure that at all wavebands the number of
Monte Carlo photons in most bins is larger than 100.

In this case the amplitudes of X-ray and TeV ﬂux show a
quadratic relationship very similar to the observed relationship in
Mrk 421. The cross correlation suggests that TeV γ-ray variability
lags that in X-rays by 2.1 ks.

on the τrelax obtained in Case 1, the one expected from the current
case should be about 230 ks, which puts 1/2πτrelax ∼ 7 × 10−7Hz
close to the edge of the covered frequency. This means the fre-
quency range we use might not be sufﬁcient to accurately identify
the PSD break of optical emission in this case. Therefore the value
obtained here should be treated with caution.

4.2 Case 2: Fixed injection rate

In this case particle injection is constant in the acceleration region
along the spine of the cylinder. Plots in format similar to those
shown in Fig. 4,5 & 7 are shown in Fig. 8. The ﬁtted parameters
for the PSDs are shown in Table 2. We can see that the PSDs in this
case show similar trends as the ones observed in Case 1, but com-
pared to that case, the X-ray PSDs here generally break at longer
time scales, or lower frequency, while the optical and γ-ray PSDs
break at shorter time scales, or higher frequency. Another differ-
ence is that TeV γ-ray lightcurve shows a signiﬁcantly higher frac-
tional variability than that of GeV γ-rays. The ﬂux-ﬂux correla-
tion is shown to be close to linear rather than quadratic. The cross-
correlation function shows a small TeV γ-ray lag of 0.6 ks, that is
statistically compatible with zero lag.

4.3 Case 3: Slower acceleration decay

Compared to Case 1, here the acceleration decay time scale, τ ′
decay,
is changed from 2Z ′/c to 4Z ′/c. The results are shown in Fig. 9.
Mostly they are consistent with the results of Case 1. The effect of
the longer acceleration decay time is that most of the ﬁtted relax-
ation times τrelax (except optical) for the PSDs become roughly a
factor of 2 larger, which is a result of doubling of the acceleration
decay time. The complication with the optical PSD is that, based

5 DISCUSSION

5.1 Comparison with Observation

In all the simulated cases, there is a good match between the simu-
lated and observational SED, except the spectral indices at γ-rays.
The SED observed by Fermi appears to be softer, which is at least
partially caused by the fact that the Fermi data points are 4-year av-
erages, while the other points and the simulation are snapshot SEDs
at ﬂaring state. The SED at very high energy (VHE) γ-rays (γ-rays
above 300 GeV) is also always slightly softer than the observed
one (see also Fossati et al. 2008) 1. This softer γ-ray spectrum re-
sults in simulated VHE γ-ray light curves that are dominated by
photon ﬂux from the low-energy end at around 500 GeV, which
should vary much slower than ﬂux above 1 TeV energy. Therefore
the simulated VHE γ-ray light curves do not fully reproduce certain
very fast variations as seen in observations. In general, the reason
that observational X-ray and γ-ray light curves are plotted together
with their simulated counterparts is not for detailed ﬁtting, but only

1 This issue will not be solved by the consideration of the extragalactic
light absorption (Finke et al. 2010) because that effect will only further
soften the simulated γ-ray spectrum.

to show that they exhibit variations of comparable amplitude and
time scale.

The fractional rms variability shown in the simulated and ob-
servational PSDs are reasonably close. However, the observational
PSDs do not exhibit the interesting breaks we look for. The X-ray
PSD has a slope close to -2, consistent with a characteristic time
larger than those covered here. On the other hand, the PSD in Fermi
γ-rays has a PSD slope close to 0, consistent with a high frequency
break. It may appear attempting to explain the γ-ray light curve
with fast decay and X-ray light curve with slow decay because of
the un-observed high/low frequency PSD breaks. But such fast de-
cay in γ-rays typically implies a fractional rms variability larger
than that in X-ray. This is not the case according to those same ob-
served PSDs. This inconsistency between the X-ray and γ-ray PSD
slopes poses a challenge to both leptonic and hadronic emission
models. However, it should be noted that even though the Fermi
PSD already has the white noise removed (Abdo et al. 2010a), the
remaining variability amplitude for Mrk 421 is similar to the white-
noise amplitude. Considering that the white-noise level of the ob-
servation has its own uncertainty, one should view those data points
with extra caution.

The lack of any break in the observational PSDs indicates that
in reality the break may only exist at longer or shorter time scale,
which is beyond our current observation capability. The interpreta-
tion of the X-ray PSD might be further complicated if the quiescent
state of the X-ray has a signiﬁcant contribution from IC or hadronic
emission, for which particles should have a long cooling time at the

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

corresponding energy. This may result in a PSD with two compo-
nents both having slope -2, but not aligned with each other.2 Since
the study of the PSD break and its relationship with various time
scales in the system is the primary goal of the current work, we
only chose simulation parameters that lead to PSD break within
the frequency range we cover, therefore the simulated PSD is guar-
anteed not to match the observed PSD by design. This mismatch
does not compromise the validity of the model as a whole, but only
means we have to keep in mind that the relaxation time derived
in this work is not the real system relaxation time for Mrk 421, or
what we see in observation is a mixture of multiple relaxation times
instead of a single relaxation time.

As we can see, with our current model, we can now simulate
stochastic variability in many different wavebands. But the obser-
vational data we can compare to, especially the PSDs, are still rel-
atively sparse. Future observations may provide us with PSDs that
span a larger range of time scales (higher cadence and longer total
time 3), at more wavebands including the optical and VHE γ-rays.

2 Notice the X-ray PSDs measured by MAXI and ASCA (Isobe et al. 2015)
are also not perfectly aligned. But the misalignment is so small that it is
probably an artifact from the different calibrations of two instruments rather
than a result of two PSD components.
3 Notice that the observation does not necessarily need to be high-cadence
all the time. High-cadence data for certain short periods of time would be
sufﬁcient for obtaining the PSD at high frequency.

Figure 9. Figures similar to those shown in Fig. 4, 5 & 7, but for Case 3 with slower acceleration decay (§ 4.3). Figures include SEDs, full light curves,
ﬂux-ﬂux correlation in the top panel, as well as short light curves, PSDs, cross-correlation in the bottom panel.

These observations will be essential in discriminating blazar mod-
els and enriching our knowledge of blazar variability.

5.2 Correlations

Fossati et al. (2008) have shown that in an SSC model of Mrk 421,
seed photons with energy between 5 eV and 500 eV are most im-
portant for TeV-band emission. By considering the larger Doppler
factor used in our cases, this range is further reduced to 2-200 eV.
At the same time, the electrons that are responsible for the IC emis-
sion are emitting synchrotron photons in X-ray. Therefore the TeV
ﬂux can be considered as representative to a product of the X-ray
ﬂux and the lower energy ﬂux that can be represented by the opti-
cal ﬂux. This aspect also affects the phase correlation of TeV γ-rays
with the X-rays. The optical light curves for cases 1 and 3 are not
perfectly symmetric, with the decay being generally slower. This
is because the diffusion-caused escape from the entire emission re-
gion, even though faster than cooling at these energy, is still rela-
tively slow compared to the changes of injection. It is this asymme-
try that causes its product with the X-ray to be delayed compared
to the X-ray. This is likely the main cause of the marginal TeV lags
observed in those two cases.

Another subtle effect that alters γ-ray lightcurves is internal
light-travel-time effects (LTTEs), i.e. the effects of the extra time
the seed photons need to spend traveling within the emission region
before they are IC scattered by high-energy electrons. That extra
time is typically a fraction of the light-crossing time of the emis-

sion region, which is roughly 10 ks in terms of delay in the observed
signal in our current cases. This ’fraction’ turns out to be ∼ 0.4
in a case where the high-energy electrons are homogeneously dis-
tributed and do not cool signiﬁcantly (Chen et al. 2014a). In the
current case where acceleration-diffusion causes the emission re-
gion to be dominated by its central portion, this fraction is likely
much smaller, and so is the impact of internal LTTEs.

In Case 2 the optical ﬂux is relatively stable compared to the
other cases, due to the constant rate of particle injection at low en-
ergy. This is the main reason why in this case the ﬂux-ﬂux correla-
tion is close to linear, while in the other two cases it is quadratic. In
the study of Chen et al. (2011), a quadratic relationship is seen in
the rising phase of the ﬂare, while a linear relationship is evident in
the decay phase. That work neglected particle escape which causes
a decrease in the number of the low-energy electrons that emit the
seed photons, whereas in the new model spatial diffusion offers a
way for particles to escape once the injection rate decreases.

It is interesting to note that even though the observational
data plotted for comparison show a quadratic relationship, there
are also other times when a linear trend (Fossati et al. 2008;
Aleksi´c et al. 2015b), and occasionally even a cubic correlation
(Aharonian et al. 2009a), is observed. It is also important to notice
that the relationship is sensitive to the choice of X-ray energy band
(Katarzy´nski et al. 2005), because bands at higher energy generally
tend to be more variable, as can be seen in the simulated X-ray light
curves and PSDs, as well as in observations (Aleksi´c et al. 2015a).
Our simulations suggest that a quadratic relationship between

X-ray and TeV γ-ray is accompanied by TeV lags on the order of
several ks, while a linear relationship is associated with insigniﬁ-
cant lag of less than 1ks. Interestingly, Fossati et al. (2008) found
both a quadratic relationship between X-ray and TeV γ-ray, and a
TeV γ-ray/ soft X-ray lag of 2.1ks during the ﬂare in March 19,
2001, while seeing a linear relationship and no signiﬁcant lag dur-
ing the other time periods of that same week.

Even though the TeV lags in § 4.1 & 4.3 are more signiﬁcant
than the one in § 4.2, the uncertainty is still large in those cases. we
therefore can not draw further quantitative conclusions regarding
the TeV lags.

5.3 Power Spectral Density

A key feature of the PSDs in an O-U process, or in our simula-
tions, is a break where the PSD changes from white noise at low
frequencies to red noise at high frequencies. Because the break fre-
quency is deﬁned as 1/(2πτrelax), we can use it to infer the relax-
ation timescale of a system. For example, Finke & Becker (2014,
2015) studied the electron-transport equation in the Fourier domain
with an analytical approach and found the breaks to be associated
with the inverse of the cooling time. However, in order to make the
equations analytically tractable, they sacriﬁced considering more
complicated processes and effects such as the particle acceleration,
the spatial inhomogeneity, and the LTTEs. Instead, they used direct
injection of high-energy electrons assuming they are accelerated
instantaneously, leaving radiative cooling as the only process that
acts on the electrons.

With our more complex acceleration-diffusion model, we ﬁnd
that the system relaxation in blazars reﬂects more than just the cool-
ing. For 2-4 keV emission the cooling time of the underlying elec-
trons is in fact an order of magnitude smaller than the relaxation
time, τrelax, identiﬁed in § 4.1. The connection between τrelax in
the X-ray band and the timescale on which the acceleration rate
decay/Γ) is established in § 4.3, where τrelax is found to
changes (τ ′
double when τ ′
decay doubles. This connection is explained as fol-
lows: Most of the time the electrons are in an equilibrium between
acceleration and cooling, at least locally in the acceleration cells.
Emission from these cells also dominates the high energy end of the
spectrum (see Paper I). So at those energies the emission changes
follow the acceleration changes. However, their relationship is not
linear, and so τrelax and τ ′

decay/Γ are not always the same.

The adherence of the ﬂux to the acceleration is further en-
hanced by the assumed relation between particle injection and ac-
celeration (§ 4.1 & 4.3). Once this relation is broken (§ 4.2), the ﬂux
variability becomes slightly weaker on short timescales, and values
of τ are shown to increase.

The effects of cooling on τrelax are evident from the fact that
τrelax is energy dependent, with τrelax being larger for lower energy
in both synchrotron and IC component. This trend is caused by the
fact that cooling cannot instantaneously return the system to a local
equilibrium, especially considering that there is counter-reaction
from acceleration even when it is relatively weak. The slower the
cooling is at lower energy, the stronger it modulates the light curves
decay. It is also interesting to note
that are still mainly affected by τ ′
that in the 1-3 eV optical band, the lowest energy frequency for
which we analyzed the PSD, the breaks are also consistent with be-
ing caused by the synchrotron cooling time scale at that frequency.
Fitting breaks in γ-ray PSDs generally yields larger timescales
than found in X-ray PSDs. For Fermi γ-rays, this is at least partly
caused by the fact that they originate from lower energy particles,
which has longer cooling time. For VHE γ-rays, another important

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

reason might be that these γ-ray emission reﬂects both the optical
ﬂux and the X-ray output. Therefore γ-ray variability may be bet-
ter described as a mixture of more than one O-U processes, as pro-
posed by Sobolewska et al. (2014). Since the optical PSD breaks at
low frequency, the γ-ray PSDs also begin to turn over at relatively
low frequency, even though they do not necessarily change to red
noise as in a single O-U process. In Case 2, the variability in opti-
cal ﬂux is minimal, therefore it only slightly alters the γ-ray PSDs,
leaving the difference in the breaks identiﬁed from the γ-ray and
X-ray PSDs relatively small.

5.4 Fractional Variability

The fractional rms variability as represented by the PSDs show
that the amplitude of X-ray variability increases with photon en-
ergy, consistent with the observations of Mrk 421 (Fossati et al.
2000; Abdo et al. 2011; Aleksi´c et al. 2015a). However, the vari-
ability of the lower energy bands in both the synchrotron and IC
components depends on the model assumptions. In the constant
particle-injection case (Case 2), both optical and GeV γ-ray vari-
ability are weak, even though the X-ray and TeV γ-ray are still
very much variable. This type of activity is observed in Mrk 421
(Abdo et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2014b) especially during its non-
ﬂaring state (Aleksi´c et al. 2015a). If the injection varies a lot dur-
ing ﬂares (§ 4.1 & 4.3), the variability at lower energies of both syn-
chrotron and IC components is increased due to the large variation
in lower-energy particles. In those cases the compatibility between
the model and the observations is no longer immediately appar-
ent. But if one assumes that both situations (injection varies or not)
occasionally happen in reality, one can notice that in real obser-
vations the cases where quadratic relationship between X-ray and
TeV γ-ray exists, which correspond to the cases with larger op-
tical or GeV γ-ray variability in our model, are not so common
(Fossati et al. 2008). The rare occurrence of large radio-optical and
GeV ﬂares (See Hovatta et al. 2015, for a large GeV γ-ray and ra-
dio ﬂare of Mrk 421 in 2012) implies that they have little contribu-
tion to the total fractional variability, therefore it is not surprising
that the overall variability in those bands is still lower than that
in X-rays and TeV γ-rays. Another possible explanation is that at
low energies the emission may have a signiﬁcant contribution from
separate non-varying emission regions (Chen et al. 2011).

6 CONCLUSION

In this work we modelled the stochastic variation of blazar emission
in many wavebands, using physically motivated acceleration and
decay processes. The main ﬁndings include:

(i) Our simulations predict the quadratic relationship between
X-ray and TeV γ-ray to be associated with TeV γ-ray lags with
respect to X-ray. These quadratic relationship and lags are also ac-
companied by strong optical and GeV γ-ray ﬂares.

(ii) All those three features are results of large increase in the

injection into the particle acceleration process.

(iii) Possible detections of PSD breaks in blazars will reveal the
characteristic relaxation time in blazars. An example of such relax-
ation is the decay of the particle acceleration as modelled in our
simulations. The breaks may be energy dependent because of cool-
ing, but they do not necessarily correspond to the cooling time.

(iv) The mismatch between the currently observed PSD slopes
in X-rays and γ-rays presents a challenge to existing blazar emis-
sion models.

Our ﬁndings also call for better characterization of the statisti-
cal property of blazar variability in different wavebands, hence en-
courage future high-cadence and long-term monitoring campaigns.
