Principal Symbol of Euler-Lagrange Operators

Abstract: We shall introduce the principal symbol for Euler-Lagrange operators and use them to charac-

terise well-posed initial value problems. We shall clarify how constraints can arise in Lagrangian covariant
theories by extending the standard treatment in GR. Finally, we sketch a quantization procedure based on

what done in LQG.

1. Introduction

Since most physically relevant ﬁeld theories are degenerate due to gauge symmetries, the stan-
dard approach to canonical quantization goes through a constraint analysis of their Hamiltonian
formulation; see for example [1] for application to Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG).

Unfortunately, there is no consensus on a covariant Hamiltonian framework for ﬁeld theories
and diﬀerent approaches often diﬀer on details. Moreover, while some constraints are deduced
directly by Hamilton equations (which are equivalent to Euler-Lagrange equations so that it is
almost trivial to argue that they should be obtained in Lagrangian framework as well), other
constraints emerge from the Poisson structure which is non-canonical on the Lagrangian side.
Accordingly, it is not clear whether it is always possible and where to search for constraints in
Lagrangian formalism.

The same constraint analysis used for quantization is however used for the analysis of well-
posedness of Cauchy problems. Since Hamilton equations are equivalent to Euler-Lagrange
equations the same information should be available in the Lagrangian framework.

In [2] we reviewed the analysis of standard Einstein equations and their initial value problem.
The analysis relies on a formulation of the Cauchy theorem which claims that a Cauchy problem
is well-posed if the principal symbol of the PDE operator is symmetric hyperbolic; see [2] or
[3] and below. This allows a completely algebraic analysis based on the structure of principal
symbol. In the case of standard GR, the principal symbol of (the evolution part of) Einstein
equations turns out not to be symmetric. That is where gauge ﬁxing enters the game. One
can show that by choosing harmonic coordinates (see [4], [5], [6], [7], [2], [8], ) obtaining a
symmetric hyperbolic problem for which Cauchy theorem holds true ([3] and references quoted
therein, as well as [9]) and initial problem is well-posed.

However, one should argue that since the principal symbol is invariant and intrinsically deﬁned
changing coordinates should not aﬀect its symmetry properties, as in fact we shall show below in
general, i.e. without even assuming ﬁelds are sections of a vector bundle. In view of invariance
of principal symbols there is no transformation on the conﬁguration bundle (and hence no
coordinate transformation on the base) which can make symmetric a principal symbol which
was not symmetric originally.

In order to solve this apparent contradiction (and better understanding the role of harmonic
gauge in GR) we shall show that one can split the (covariant) equation in two (non-covariant)
parts, one providing a symmetric hyperbolic (hence well-posed) problem, the other produced by
the antisymmetric part either becomes a further constraint or it is satisﬁed in a particular class

1

of coordinate systems. Solving the non-covariant problem in one of such coordinate systems
provides solutions of the original covariant problem and then by changing coordinates a solution
of the original problem is found in any coordinate system.

Here we have to check that this mechanism works in general for a Lagrangian ﬁeld theory.
The general analysis of course forgets about details and it is probably easier to follow than the
particular analysis of standard GR. On the other hand standard GR can be considered as an
example of application of the general framework here introduced.

Although most of what follows can be easily extended to general diﬀerential operators between
bundles we shall specialise to operators which come from a variational principle (see [10]). This
of course includes the application to natural theories and GR and it turns out to show that the
general analytical approach (see [3]) does not in fact depend on a metric structure of spacetime
or a linear structure for ﬁelds.

As a matter of fact this framework provides a way of analysing Dirac-Bergman constraints on

a purely Lagrangian basis.

In Section 4 we shall review ADM formalism.

In Section 2 we shall ﬁx notation. In Section 3 we shall introduce principal symbol and review
its invariance.
In Section 5 we propose two
schemes for associating to the original operator a symmetric hyperbolic one, possibly introducing
new constraints or partially ﬁxing coordinate gauge.
In Section 6 we brieﬂy describe few
examples. In Section 7 we brieﬂy state how this structure can be adapted to a quantization
scheme proposed by Rovellil; see [1].

The whole framework presented here is just a sketch and a lot of work and further investigation
is needed in order to better understand its application scope (which here is supported by few
but relevant standard cases only). We brieﬂy discuss perspectives in Section 7.

2. Notation

We shall hereafter deal with Lagrangian ﬁeld theories. Fields are (global) sections of a bundle
C = (C, M, π, F ), called conﬁguration bundle. In general we shall not assume the conﬁguration
bundle to be a vector (or aﬃne) bundle. In GR the conﬁguration bundle Lor(M ) is not a vector
bundle (though it is a sub-bundle of a vector bundle Lor(M ) ⊂ S2(M ), namely the bundle
of symmetric tensors of rank 2). The base manifold M is thought as a (connected, oriented,
paracompact) spacetime manifold of dimension dim(M ) = m.

We shall assume ﬁbered coordinates (xµ, yi) on C and general transition functions in the form

( x′µ = x′µ(x)

y′i = Y i(x, y)

(2.1)

In order to deal with PDE one has to introduce jet bundles J kC. Any ﬁbered coordinates
on C induces a natural ﬁbered “coordinate” system jky = (xµ, yi, yi
µ1...µk ) on the jet
prolongations. The coordinates (yi
µ1...µk ) are meant to represent partial derivatives
of ﬁelds yi(x) with respect to independent variables xµ and they are accordingly considered as
symmetric in lower indices.

Transition functions (2.1) on the conﬁiguration bundle C are prolonged to the jet bundles. In

particular, one has

where jk−1y = (xµ, yi, yi
j = ∂j Y i(x, y) and J i

µ (x) =
∂µx′σ(x) for the Jacobian along the base coordinates. The bar over Jacobians denotes inverse
matrices.

µ = ∂µY i(x, y) for the Jacobians of the ﬁber transformation and J σ

Let us remark that, for a general bundle C, transformations (2.2) are aﬃne transformations,
k−1 : J kC → J k−1C is always aﬃne even when the bundle C is
meaning that the jet bundle πk
not aﬃne or linear.

3. Field equations in a Lagrangian ﬁeld theory

In general, diﬀerential operators are maps between a suitable jet prolongation bundle J dC into
some ﬁxed target vector bundle E.

The corresponding diﬀerential equation is identiﬁed with the kernel of the map considered as
a submanifold of the jet prolongation, namely, S ⊂ J dC.

However, in variational calculus diﬀerential operators are not generic but obtained by Euler-
Lagrange morphisms. They are hence in a speciﬁc form which is particularly well-suited to
discuss principal symbols of diﬀerential operators. In particular they show that principal sym-
bols and their relevant properties are canonically deﬁned and independent of any metric deﬁned
on the base manifold (i.e. the spacetime) or on the standard ﬁber (i.e. the space of ﬁelds). More-
over, it is independent of any linear (or aﬃne) structure deﬁned on the conﬁguration bundle.

If C is assumed as the conﬁguration bundle of a Lagrangian ﬁeld theory, then Euler-Lagrange

operator of a k-order Lagrangian is a map

E : J 2kC → V ∗(C) ⊗ Am(M )

(3.1)

where J 2kC is the jet prolongation of the conﬁguration bundle C, (V (C), C, p, Rk) is the vector
bundle of vertical vectors on C, V ∗(C) denotes its dual, Am(M ) is, by an abuse of notation,
the pull-back of the bundle of m-form over M along the projection π : C → M (and hence
should be denoted precisely as π∗(Am(M )) to denote a bundle over C). The tensor product
V ∗(C) ⊗ Am(M ) is hence to be considered as a the tensor product of vector bundles over C.

If the Lagrangian is degenerate (as it often happens in ﬁeld theory) the Euler-Lagrange mor-

phism can actually be of lower order, i.e. it projects to a morphism

E : J dC → V ∗(C) ⊗ Am(M )

(3.2)

for some d ≤ 2k.

d−1 : J dC → J d−1C is an aﬃne bundle, one can intrinsically deﬁne quasi-linear operators
Since πd
on any bundle, i.e. also when the conﬁguration bundle C is not assumed to be an aﬃne or a
vector bundle.

Non-degenerate variational equations are always quasi-linear in view of their variational origin.
Also in degenerate cases all equations which are used in fundamental physics are quasi-linear
although one can provide (somehow artiﬁcial) examples of Lagrangians with ﬁeld equations
which are not quasi-linear.

3

For example, if one considers the Lagrangian (on (R × R2, R2, π, R) with coordinates (x1, x2, y))

L =

y

(y1)2 + (y2)2 (y11y22 − (y12)2)

ﬁeld equations are obtained as

y11y22 − (y12)2
(y1)2 + (y2)2 = 0

which are second order (instead of fourth-order) and not quasi-linear.

(3.3)

(3.4)

In any event, we shall hereafter restrict to Lagrangians of order k which produce quasi-linear
Euler-Lagrange equations of order d ≤ 2k. Accordingly, one has the Euler-Lagrange operator
in the form

E = Ei(jdy) ¯dyi ⊗ dσ

Ei(jdy) = eα1...αd

ij

α1...αd + bi(jd−1y)
yj

(3.5)

where ¯dyi is the dual basis of vertical vectors ∂i and dσ is the standard basis of m-forms on M
induced by base coordinates.

The coeﬃcient of the leading term transforms as

kh

¯J σ1
µ1 (x) . . . ¯J σd

µd (x)

(3.6)

where J(x) denotes the determinant of the Jacobian J α
µ .

Depending on the theory, one can have eα1...αd
depending on (xµ, yi), or on (jny) with 0 ≤ n ≤ d−1
and each of it is preserved by transition functions (2.1). On the contrary, in general, coeﬃcients

In GR the conﬁguration bundle Lor(M) is not a vector bundle. The leading term e

kh

Notice that eβ1...βd
is symmetric with respect to (kh) (non-degenerate, respectively) if and only
if e′α1...αd
is also symmetric with respect to (ij) (non-degenerate, respectively). In other words,
if the morphism is not symmetric (non-degenerate, respectively) in one trivialization it cannot
be made symmetric (non-degenerate, respectively) by changing trivialization. In particular it
cannot be made symmetric (non-degenerate, respectively) by changing coordinates on M even
though C is a natural bundle and changes of coordinates on M induce functorially changes of
trivialization.

Consider now a bundle morphism (over the identity idC : C → C)

σ : Sd(T ∗M ) → V ∗(C) ⊗ V ∗(C) ⊗ Am(M )

(3.7)

where Sd(T ∗M ) is the symmetrized d-power of cotangent bundle (pulled-back on C along the
projection π : C → M ).

The bundle Sd(T ∗M ) (again understood to be pulled back on C along πn : J nC → M ) has
ﬁbered coordinates (xµ, yi, . . . , yi
, ξα1...αd ) (which are meant to be symmetric in the lower
indices (α1 . . . αd)). In view of transition functions the ﬁbered morphism σ is expressed as

α1...αn

σ(jny, ξα1...αd ) = σα1...αd

ij

(jny)ξα1...αd

¯dyi ⊗ ¯dyj ⊗ dσ

(3.8)

4

with 0 ≤ n ≤ d − 1 and the coeﬃcient σα1...αd

ij

transforms as in (3.6).

Thus there is a one-to-one correspondence between leading terms of global diﬀerential operators

E and global linear bundle morphisms σ.

If C = (E, M, π, V ) is an aﬃne bundle then transition functions are in the form

x′µ = x′µ(x)
v′i = Ai

j (x)vj + Bi(x)



j speciﬁes to J i

j (x, y) = Ai

and the Jacobian J i
j (x) and it does depend on the base coordinates only.
Accordingly, in this case one can also consider diﬀerential operators with a leading term which
depends on base coordinates only (namely, having eα1...αd
the trivialization on vector bundles.
For the principal symbol morphism σ : Sd(T ∗M) → V ∗(C) ⊗ V ∗(C) ⊗ Am(M) one can use the
canonical isomorphism V (C) ≃ E ⊕ E and the projection onto the second factor to identify the
bundles V ∗(C) ≃ E ⊕ E∗. Thus the principal symbol can be written in the form

(x)), being this property independent of

ij

(3.9)

σ : Sd(T ∗M) ⊗ E → E ⊗ Am(M)

(3.10)

which is often found in the literature. We prefer the form (3.7) which is more canonical being it

available for any conﬁguration bundle, not only on vector and aﬃne bundles. Moreover, the form

(3.7) makes it easier to discuss symmetric properties and non-degeneracy.

The morphism σ is called the principal symbol morphism. If the image of σ in contained into
symmetric bilinear forms S2(V ∗(C)) ⊂ V ∗(C) ⊗ V ∗(C) (a property which is independent of the
trivialization, as noticed above) then the diﬀerential operator is called symmetric. If the image
of σ (except the zero section in S2k(T ∗M )) is contained into non-degenerate symmetric bilinear
forms then the diﬀerential operator is called elliptic.

For any quasi-linear operator one can deﬁne the principal symbol and characteristic directions
are the covectors ξ such that σ(ξ ⊗ . . . ⊗ ξ) = 0. That describes the characteristic distribution.
One can show that ﬁeld equations constrain possible values of solutions along characteristics di-
rections. Accordingly, Cauchy hypersurfaces should be chosen so that no characteristic direction
lies on them.

4. ADM decomposition

An ADM splitting of the spacetime M is a bundle S = (M, R, t, Σ) which foliates the spacetime
M in a 1-parameter family of 3-manifolds isomorphic to Σ. This is a general result since any foli-
ation in hypersurfaces can be considered as a bundle (provided the leaves are all diﬀeomorphic);
see [11], [12].

Notice that being the base R of the bundle S contractible the bundle is trivial, then M ≃ Σ × R
and M is called a globally hyperbolic spacetime.
The ﬁbers Σs = t−1(s) ⊂ M are called synchronous hypersurfaces or space hypersurfaces at time
s. The map t : M → R is usually thought as a map attaching the time at each event that happens

and events on the same ﬁber happen at the same time and are hence synchronous.

Of course, diﬀerent observers may deﬁne diﬀerent notion of synchronization and then diﬀerent
ADM splittings.

The spacetime M can be covered with ﬁbered coordinates (t, xa) with respect to the ADM

5

splitting. Such coordinate systems are called ADM coordinates or ADM observers. The transi-
tion functions among ADM observers are in the form

( t′ = t′(t)

x′a = x′a(t, x)

(4.1)

and any (globally hyperbolic) spacetime can always be covered with a family of ADM observers
which share the same deﬁnition of time. ADM coordinates are not the most general coordinate
systems on M since in general one can consider observers which do not share the same ADM
splitting.

Notice that a connection of the ADM splitting (is a rank 1, hence integrable distribution and it)
deﬁnes integral curves which connect events on diﬀerent leaves Σs of the ADM foliation. Such
a congruence of curves establishes isomorphisms among spaces at diﬀerent times and eventually
deﬁnes a notion of events at rest with respect to the ADM spitting.

Given a quasi-linear diﬀerential operator E of order d = 1 and an ADM splitting the operator

can be written in ADM coordinates as

eijyj

0 + ea

ijyj

a + bi(t, x, y) = 0

(4.2)

where the coeﬃcients eij(t, x, y) and ea

ij(t, x, y) are meant to be independent of ﬁrst derivatives

A ﬁrst order operator is called symmetric hyperbolic if eij
invertible, the inverse being denoted by eij) and if ea

ij is symmetric in (ij).

is deﬁnite positive (and hence

An important result states that for ﬁrst order symmetric hyperbolic operators the Cauchy

theorem holds true, i.e. there exists a unique solution for each initial condition, namely:

Theorem: Let eij be a non-degenerate positive-deﬁnite bilinear form (or, in other words sym-
metric hyperbolic) and let ea
ij be symmetric in indices ij for all a, then under these hypotheses,
given the initial data in H k(M ), with k > m
2 + 1, the existence and uniqueness is ensured in an
open interval I ⊂ R and in a suitable Sobolev space, which depends on the regularity of the
initial data (see [3]).

Here H k(M ) is the Sobolev space of k order deﬁned over M , see [3], [13] and [14].

Let us investigate the transformation rules of principal symbol in order to determine whether
being symmetric hyperbolic is a property of the operator or it depends on the ADM coordinate
system.

First order operators

Let us start with ﬁrst order operators, i.e. operators in the form

eijyj

a + bi(x, y) = 0

Transition functions with respect to changes of ADM coordinates read as

positive. For second-order symmetric hyperbolic operators the Cauchy theorem holds true,
i.e. there exists a unique solution for each initial condition; see the Appendix.

5. Symmetrization of Operators

In the previous Section we showed that an Euler-Lagrange operator cannot be made sym-
metric hyperbolic by changing coordinates or trivialization if it not symmetric hyperbolic in
the beginning (except the speciﬁc cases in which ea
ij is not symmetric, which however does not
include standard GR). On the other hand, standard GR provides us with an example of a ﬁeld
theory with Euler-Lagrange operator which is not symmetric hyperbolic; see [2].

However, there are at least two ways in which one can construct a new symmetric hyperbolic
operator out of the original Euler-Lagrange operator. Let us discuss these methods on a ﬁrst
order operator.

Given a quasi-linear ﬁrst order operator

which is not symmetric hyperbolic, one can write it as

eijyj

0 + ea

ij yj

a + bi(x, y) = 0

eij yj

0 + ea

[ij]yj

a + ea

(ij)yj

a + bi(x, y) = 0

(5.1)

(5.2)

Now instead of looking for solutions for this operator let us split it and look for solutions of the
system

(ij)yj

a + bi(x, y) = 0

( eijyj

ea
[ij]yj

0 + ea
a = 0

(5.3)

Now one can proceed in at least two ways.

8

The covariant symmetrization

Depending on the ﬁelds which are deﬁned on C one can look for a tail qi(t, x, y) to add which
makes the two equations in the system (5.3) covariant. If such a tail exists, then the system

( eijyj

[ij]yj
ea

a + bi(x, y) − qi = 0

0 + ea
(ij)yj
a + qi = 0

(5.4)

is again covariant. The second equation of (5.4) is a constraint on the Cauchy surface S; since
it does not contain time derivatives it constrains allowed initial conditions. One can hope that
the second equation is elliptic and always has solutions. For any solution of the second equation
of (5.4) one can deﬁne a Cauchy problem for the ﬁrst equation of (5.4), which is now symmetric
hyperbolic and hence determines a unique evolution of ﬁelds.

Such an evolution of ﬁelds is a solution of the initial equation (5.1) with the imposed initial

condition.

The non-covariant symmetrization

If one cannot deﬁne a suitable tail to return to covariant equations, then precisely because
these are not covariant one can look for a coordinate system in which the second equation of
(5.3) is satisﬁed (as done in standard GR by going to harmonic coordinates). If this is always
possible (i.e. if there exists a coordinate system for any conﬁguration so that the second equation
is satisﬁed) then the ﬁrst equation of (5.3) determines a unique evolution for ﬁelds.

The operator associated to the ﬁrst equation of (5.3) is not the original operator any longer
(due to the subtraction of the antisymmetric part of the principal symbol). However, a solution
of the symmetrized operator (i.e. the ﬁrst equation in (5.3)) in a coordinate system in which
also the second equation of (5.3) is satisﬁed, is a solution of the original problem (5.1). Finally,
being the original operator covariant, knowing a solution for it in a particular coordinate system
gives as a solution of (5.1) in any coordinate system.

Let us stress that in both cases, strictly speaking, one does not solve in fact the original

equation (5.1).

In the covariant symmetrization scheme a covariant constraint is added to the theory. Let
us stress however, that we do not used any notion similar to a Poisson structure to determine
them (which of course would be non-canonical in Lagrangian formalism).

In the non-covariant symmetrization scheme the (non-covariant) equation which is in fact
solved (i.e. the ﬁrst equation in (5.3)) coincides with the original (5.1) only in a family of
coordinate systems, while it diﬀers from it in general. If one ﬁnds a solution for standard GR
and then goes in a non-harmonic coordinate system, the new metric is a solution of Einstein
equations though it does not solve the non-covariant symmetrized Cauchy problem.

6. Examples

Let us consider some examples.

Electromagnetism

Let us consider Maxwell electromagnetism on Minkowski spacatime (R4, η) as an example.
Let us ﬁx Cartesian coordinates on spacetime (so that the metric is η = diag(− + ++)) and
the ADM foliation π : R4 → R : xµ 7→ x0 so that the space hypersurfaces are given by
St = {x ∈ R4 : x0 = t}.

The conﬁguration bundle accounts for the quadripotential Aµ. In other words C has ﬁbered
coordinates (xµ, Aµ). Fields can be adapted to the ADM foliation by deﬁning

A = A0

~A = Ai

which are a scalar ﬁeld and a vector ﬁeld on S = R3, respectively.

Electromagnetism is a ﬁrst order theory and the one can deﬁne the ﬁeld strength

Fµν := dµAν − dν Aµ

F µν := ηµαηνβFαβ

Also the ﬁeld strength can be projected to space by setting

Fi = d0Ai − diA0

Fij = diAj − djAi ⇒


Bk := 1

Ei := F 0i

2 ǫijkFij =(cid:16)curl( ~A)(cid:17)k

The dynamics is induced by the Maxwell Lagrangian

L = − 1

4 Fµν F µν = 1

2(cid:0)|E|2 − |B|2(cid:1)

where we used the fact that Fij = ǫk

ij Bk.

Field equations are

which can be projected to space as

dµF µν = 0

( diF i0 = 0

d0F 0i + djF ji = 0

⇒( ∇ · E = 0

d0E − (∇ × B) = 0

(6.1)

(6.2)

(6.3)

(6.4)

(6.5)

(6.6)

The ﬁrst equation is clearly a constraint equation, while the second is a candidate for evolution
equation.

The evolution equation reads as

d0Ei − ǫijkdjBk = 0

(6.7)

which are three equations for the four ﬁelds Aµ. Accordingly, one of the fundamental ﬁelds can
be chosen at will in view of gauge freedom, A′
µ = Aµ + dµα. One can show that for any Aµ
one can always choose α so that A0 = 0, which is called the temporal gauge. The component

10

A0 is essentially left arbitrary by equations and fortunately can be ﬁxed to zero by the gauge
symmetry. Then the physical ﬁelds are Ai. In terms of the physical ﬁelds one has

2 ǫijkFij = ǫkijdiAj

( Bk := 1

Ei := F 0i = −d0Ai

and the evolution ﬁeld equation becomes

δim∂00Am + (δi(lδj)m − δimδjl)∂jlAm = 0

Then one has the leading coeﬃcients

eij = δij

eimjl = (δi(lδj)m − δimδjl)

(6.8)

(6.9)

(6.10)

The ﬁrst coeﬃcient eij = δij is symmetric, non-degenerate and deﬁnite positive. It is a strictly
Riemannian metric on the space of physical ﬁelds Ai.
The second coeﬃcient eimjl is symmetric in (im). The evolution equation is symmetric hyper-
bolic and given initial conditions determines the vector potential uniquely. The vector potential
deﬁnes electric and magnetic ﬁeld by (6.8).

The other Maxwell equations are identically satisﬁed in view of (6.8).
In fact, one has

∇ · B = ǫkij dikAj = 0

and

∂0B + ∇ × E = ǫkij di0Aj − ǫkij d0iAj = 0

(6.11)

(6.12)

Maxwell equations

By considering Maxwell equations in vacuum as equations for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds,

one obtains Maxwell equations in the form (6.6), i.e.

( ∂iEi = 0

∂iBi = 0

( δikd0Ek + ǫik

δikd0Bk − ǫik

j∂j Bk = 0
j∂j Ek = 0

(6.13)

The ﬁrst two equations are constraints and the second pair are ﬁrst order evolutionary equations
for the ﬁelds EA = (Ek, Bk). The leading terms are

eAB =(cid:18) δik

0

δik(cid:19)

ej

AB =(cid:18) 0

−ǫik

j

ǫik

j

0 (cid:19)

(6.14)

The time coeﬃcients eAB is symmetric, non-degenerate, deﬁnite positive form. The space
coeﬃcients ej
AB are symmetric. Thus the evolution equations are symmetric hyperbolic and
determine the ﬁelds. The second constraint ∇ · B = 0 implies that there exists a vector ~A
such that B = ∇ × ~A. At that point the second evolutionary equation imples that E = −∂0A.
Accordingly, the previous variational setting is completely recovered.

Covariant Standard GR

As shown in [2] the evolutionary part of the equation for standard GR is

A{ij}{lm}∂0∂0γlm + Bkl

{ij}{mn}∂k∂lγmn ≈ 0

where ≈ means equality modulo a lower order tail. Here the coeﬃcients are

A{ij}{lm} = γi(lγm)j

7. Quantization

Let us here sketch a quantization scheme for ﬁeld theories which can be treated in the frame-
work introduced above. The quantization scheme has been proposed for standard GR by Rovelli;
see [1].

First of all let us consider the boundary Σ of a m-region Ω ⊂ M in the form Ω = I × U with
I = [t0, t1] ⊂ R and U ⊂ S. As a special case one could consider compact boundaryless S and
Ω = I × S. In this second case there is no side boundary surface I × ∂S and Σ = Σ1 − Σ0.

One can argue that quantities that can be measured in quantum physics are only probabilities
of boundary values of ﬁelds on Σ. For this reason one can deﬁne a prequantum conﬁgurations
to be the collection of the values of ﬁelds on such a boundary Σ = ∂Ω. Let i : Σ → M be the
canonical embedding and CΣ = i∗(C) be the conﬁguration bundle restricted to Σ. Prequantum
conﬁgurations are sections of CΣ which in fact provide candidates for values of ﬁelds on Σ.

Given a prequantum conﬁguration ψ : Σ → CΣ one can ask whether there exists a solution of
ﬁeld equations on M which restricted to Σ agrees with the values dictated by ψ. In other word,
one can ask whether the prequantum conﬁguration ψ can be extended to M by a solution of
classical ﬁeld equations. If that happens ψ is called a prequantum state.

Now Ω is a portion of spacetime which is globally hyperbolic by construction. If I = [t0, t1] is
an interval, then the boundary of Ω is the union of three surfaces, namely U0 = t0 × U which is
called the initial surface, U1 = t1 × U which is called the ﬁnal surface, and S = I × ∂U which

12

is called the ﬂow surface. Any quantum experiment can be modelled by preparing a speciﬁc
conﬁguration of ﬁelds on U0, controlling what enters and exits the experimental region through
S and measuring the output of the experiment by reading the ﬁeld values on U1. Given a
prequantum state ψ is measuring which classical output can be observed in this experimental
setting.

Classical ﬁeld equations on M do determine equations for prequantum states (which are the
classical limit of a quantum description of the system). Field equations on M can in fact
be splitted into evolution-like equations (which involve maximal order k time derivatives) and
constraints-like equations (which involve time derivatives only up to order k − 1).

Then if one ﬁnds a prequantum state on the boundary on Σ there is a solution of ﬁeld equations

induces that ﬁelds on the boundary.

Quantization scheme is associated to deﬁning a Hilbert space to prequantum conﬁgurations,
deﬁning a quantum analogous of constraint equations in order to constraint functionals of the
prequantum conﬁgurations. Then restricting the Hilbert space to a Hilbert space called the
physical space which corresponds to solutions of quantum constraints. Finally one can deﬁne
observables on the physical space which spectra deﬁne quantum observables.

Let us stress the diﬀerent attitude between the classical and quantum setting. When interested
to classical solutions one starts from a solution of constraints to determine a classical solution.
When interested in quantization, one instead considers constraints as the real equation to be
quantized while the evolution part of classical equation is used to propagates classical limits
which contains information (the values of ﬁelds inside the boundary) which are not physically
accessible from a quantum viewpoint.

The application of this framework to LQG can be found in [1].

8. Conclusions and Perspectives

We showed that one can obtain the structure of Dirac-Bergman constraints by working within
Lagrangian framework only, without resorting to Hamilton formalism, by requiring that the
evolution problem to be symmetric hyperbolic. We also reviewed a quantization procedure
proposed for LQG extending it to general covariant theories.

Here we overlooked that in Euler-Lagrange operators one starts with as many ﬁeld equations as
fundamental ﬁelds in conﬁguration bundles. Hence when the Lagrangian is degenerate and only
some of ﬁeld equations are evolution equations (while the other take the form of constraints)
then one has less evolution equation than ﬁelds. Thus the ﬁelds themselves need to be split
into ﬁelds which are determined by evolution and a number of ﬁelds (which are as many as
the number of constraints) which are not determined by evolution and can be ﬁxed at will. In
speciﬁc examples this can be seen explicitly; for example in standard GR one sees directly that
lapse and shift are not determined by equations and correspond to freedom to choose the ADM
ﬁbration. Further investigations are needed to consider the situation in general and obtain a
more algorithmic procedure for splitting the ﬁelds into evolutionary degrees of freedom and
gauge ﬁelds.

All information are algebraically encoded in the principal symbol of Euler-Lagrange equations.
Let us also remark that our treatment of principal symbol is better than the standard analytical

13

approach since it does not assume a linear or aﬃne structure on conﬁguration bundle and for
Euler-Lagrange operators the deﬁnition of principal symbol is canonical and does not rely on
a metric structure. Future investigations need to be devoted to characterising Lagrangians for
which Euler-Lagrange equations splits in a symmetric hyperbolic evolution equation and an
elliptic system of constraints. One should consider if Euler-Lagrange operators for Lagrangians
which can be characterized within this framework can be splitted canonically and if the analysis
also teaches how ﬁelds should be split and adapted to the constraints in order to manifestly
render the splitting between constraints and evolution equations.

Also a better relation should be established between Lagrangian constraints and Hamiltonian
Dirac-Bergman treatment of constraints is needed. More examples of analysis of constraints of
covariant theories is needed in the ﬁrst place.

Appendix A. Cauchy theorem for second order operators

Let us brieﬂy review hereafter how one can obtain Cauchy theorem for second order operators,
from quasi-linear ﬁrst order symmetric hyperbolic ones. The procedure is interesting since it
shows how extra conditions on the principal symbol appear at higher orders besides symmetry.

As done in (4.9) we deﬁne a quasi-linear second order system as follows:

αI J (x, y)∂00yJ − αi

I J (x, y)∂0iyJ − αij

I J (x, y)∂ij yJ + γI (x, y, dy) = 0.

and its associated Cauchy problem:

( αI J ∂00yJ − αi

yJ (0, xi) = f J (xi),

I J ∂0iyJ − αij

I J ∂ijyJ + γI = 0.
∂0yJ (0, xi) = gJ (xi).

(A.1)

(A.2)

which will be called CP2.

Our goal is to transform a second order PDE in a ﬁrst order system, by introducing auxiliary

ﬁelds. Inspired by the method used for ODE we can deﬁne the following new ﬁelds:

( vJ = ∂0yJ

j = ∂j yJ
vJ

⇒ ∂0vJ

i = ∂ivJ

(A.3)

However, if we wish to consider these equations as part of the original system one should notice
that they do not correspond to diﬀerential operators with values in the dual space of ﬁeld
variations as it was for the original equation. Then one should introduce some suitable bilinear
forms to write them equivalently in the form:

( βI J(cid:0)∂0yJ − vJ(cid:1) = 0
j − ∂j vJ(cid:1) = 0
I J(cid:0)∂0vJ

βij

⇒ βij

I J(cid:0)vJ

j − ∂jyJ(cid:1) = 0

(A.4)

for some invertible coeﬃcients βI J and βij
I J .
Let us remark that the equation vJ
constraint on initial conditions and will not contribute to the Cauchy problem.

j = ∂jyJ contains no time derivative and as such is a

14

Then the equation (A.1) can be written in terms of the new ﬁelds (yI , vI , vI
Cauchy problem can be recast in the following form:

i ), so that its

αI J ∂0vJ − αi
j − βij

j ≈ 0

together with the constraint ∂iyJ = vJ
follows:

vJ (0, xi) = gJ (xi),

vJ

i . We can write this system in the block-matrix form as

This is a ﬁrst order CP so Cauchy theorem applies to it. One has existence and uniqueness
of solutions if the ﬁrst matrix is symmetric, non-degenerate, positive-deﬁnite and the second is
symmetric.

I J are
We already know that αI J is non-degenerate and positive-deﬁnite.
non-degenerate and positive-deﬁnite then the whole matrix is. Since we are free to choose βI J
as we wish (provided that the choice is non-degenerate and positive-deﬁnite) we can ﬁx it as
βI J = αI J , which is automatically a good choice.

Let us remark that once again, also for second order operators, the well-posedness of CP2
is subjected to algebraic requirements. Unlike for ﬁrst order operators symmetry is no longer
enough and one needs to require that the coeﬃcient αkj

I J is also positive-deﬁnite.

Finally, one should show that CP1 and CP2 are dynamically equivalent, i.e. there exists a
1–to–1 correspondence of solutions, so that well-posedness of CP1 implies well-posedness CP2.
For that we refer to [2].
