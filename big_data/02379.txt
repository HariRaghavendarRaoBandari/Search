AN EASTON LIKE THEOREM IN THE PRESENCE OF SHELAH

CARDINALS

MOHAMMAD GOLSHANI

Abstract. We show that Shelah cardinals are preserved under the canonical GCH

forcing notion. We also show that if GCH holds and F : REG → CARD is an Eas-

ton function which satisﬁes some weak properties, then there exists a coﬁnality pre-

serving generic extension of the universe which preserves Shelah cardinals and satisﬁes

∀κ ∈ REG, 2κ = F (κ). This gives a partial answer to a question asked by Cody [1]

and independently by Honzik [5]. We also prove an indestructibility result for Shelah

cardinals.

1. Introduction

Recall from [7] that an uncountable cardinal κ is called a Shelah cardinal, if for every

f : κ → κ, there exists an elementary embedding j : V → M with crit(j) = κ such that

κM ⊆ M and Vj(f )(κ) ⊆ M . It is also easily seen that a cardinal κ is a Shelah cardinal if

and only if, if for every f : κ → κ, there exists an elementary embedding j : V → M with

crit(j) = κ such that κM ⊆ M and H(j(f )(κ)) ⊆ M.

In this paper we study Shelah cardinals and their relation with the continuum function.

We show that Shelah cardinals are preserved under the canonical GCH forcing notion.

We also prove an analogue of Easton’s theorem in the presence of Shelah cardinals, which

partially answers a question of Cody [1] and Honzik [5]. Also indestructibility of Shelah

cardinals under some classes of Prikry type forcing notions is proved, which is similar to the

Gitik-Shelah indestructibility result for strong cardinals [4].

The structure of the paper is as follows.

In section 2 we prove a simple result about

dominating functions f : κ → κ in the generic extensions by ground model functions. In

section 3 we discuss the notion of witnessing number of a Shelah cardinal which plays an

important role in latter sections of the paper. In section 4 we show that Shelah cardinals are

preserved under the canonical GCH forcing, so that GCH is consistent with the existence

of Shelah cardinals. In section 5 we prove an Easton like theorem in the presence of Shelah

cardinals and ﬁnally in section 6 we prove an indestructibility result for Shelah cardinals

which is similar to the Gitik-Shelah indestructibility result for strong cardinals [4].

2. Dominating functions by ground model functions

In this section we prove a simple lemma about dominating functions of the generic ex-

tension by ground model functions that will be used in latter sections of this paper.

Lemma 2.1. If κ is a regular cardinal in V and P satisﬁes one of the following conditions,

then for every function f : κ → κ in a P-generic extension of V, there exists a function

g : κ → κ in V such that g dominates f , i.e., ∀α ∈ κ f (α) < g(α).

(1) |P| < κ.

(2) P is κ-c.c.

(3) P is κ+-distributive.

Proof. (3) is trivial, as such a forcing notion produces no new functions f : κ → κ, and (1)

follows from (2), so it suﬃces to prove (2). Thus suppose that P is κ-c.c., and let f ∈ V P be

a function from κ to κ. Fix a P-name f
∼

for f , and for each α < κ set

Dα = {p ∈ P : ∃β < κ, p (cid:13)“f
∼

(α) = β”}.

Dα is a dense subset of P. Let Aα ⊆ Dα be a maximal antichain of P, and set

g(α) = sup{β : ∃p ∈ Aα, p (cid:13)“f
∼

(α) = β”} + 1.

g : κ → κ is well-deﬁned (as each Aα has size < κ), and it dominates f .

(cid:3)

3. Properties of witnessing number of Shelah cardinals

In this section we introduce the witnessing number of a Shelah cardinal, which plays an

important role in subsequent sections, and discuss some of its properties.

Deﬁnition 3.1. (Suzuki [8]) Given a Shelah cardinal κ, the witnessing number of κ is the

least cardinal λ such that for any f : κ → κ, there exists an extender E ∈ Vλ witnessing the

Shelahness of κ with respect to f .

AN EASTON LIKE THEOREM IN THE PRESENCE OF SHELAH CARDINALS

Remark 3.2.

(1) Let κ be a Shelah cardinal, and for each f : κ → κ, let jf be

an elementary embedding witnessing the Shelahness of κ with respect to f . Then

wt(κ) = sup{jf (f )(κ) : f : κ → κ}; in particular wt(κ) is a singular cardinal with

κ < cf (wt(κ)) ≤ 2κ.

(2) Let κ be a Shelah cardinal, and let λ < wt(κ). Then there is f : κ → κ and an

elementary embedding j : V → M ⊇ Vj(f )(κ) with crit(j) = κ such that λ < j(f )(κ).

(3) Let κ be a Shelah cardinal, f, g : κ → κ and ∀α < κ, f (α) < g(α) + ω. Let jf : V →

Mf and jg : V → Mg witness the Shelahness of κ with respect to f and g respectively.

Then jg(f )(κ) = jf (f )(κ); in particular jg also witnesses the Shelahness of κ with

respect to f .

Lemma 3.3. (Suzuki [8]) Let κ be a Shelah cardinal. Then

(1) ∀ξ < wt(κ), κ is a ξ-strong cardinal.

(2) {λ < wt(κ) : λ is a measurable Woodin cardinal} is unbounded in wt(κ).

Thus the existence of Shelah cardinals imply the existence of large cardinals above them.

In the next lemmas we show that the above results are in some sense the best we can prove.

We show that it is consistent that κ is not wt(κ)-strong and that there are no large cardinals

above wt(κ).

Lemma 3.4. If κ is a Shelah cardinal, then any wt(κ)-strategically closed forcing notion

preserves the Shelahness of κ.

Proof. Let P be wt(κ)-strategically closed and let G be P-generic over V . Let f ∈ V [G], f :

κ → κ. Then f ∈ V. Let E ∈ Vwt(κ) be an extender witnessing the Shelahness of κ with

respect to f . Let H ∈ V [G] be the ﬁlter on j(P) generated by j[G]. By [2], H is in fact j(P)-

generic over M , and j lifts to some j∗ : V [G] → M [H]. Clearly (V [G])j∗(f )(κ) = Vj(f )(κ) ⊆

M ⊆ M [H], and hence j∗ witnesses that κ is Shelah in V [G] with respect to f .

(cid:3)

We now give some applications of the above lemma.

Lemma 3.5. Suppose κ is a Shelah cardinal. There exists a generic extension V [G] of V ,

in which κ remains Shelah and there are no Mahlo cardinals above wt(κ).

4

M. GOLSHANI

Proof. Let P be the reverse Easton iteration of forcing notions Pλ, for λ > wt(κ) a Mahlo

cardinal, where Pλ is the forcing notion for shooting a club of singular cardinals through

λ, by its approximations of size < λ. Each Pλ is λ-strategically closed, and it makes λ

an inaccessible non-Mahlo cardinal. As the full forcing P is wt(κ)-strategically closed, by

Lemma 3.4 κ remains a Shelah cardinal in V P. It is also clear that in the extension by P,

there are no Mahlo cardinals above wt(κ).

(cid:3)

In fact we can kill all inaccessible cardinals above wt(κ) preserving the Shelahness of κ.

To do this, it suﬃces to add a club C of singular cardinals above wt(κ), and then make

2α++

= α+

∗ , where α < α∗ are two successive points in C.

Lemma 3.6. If κ is a Shelah cardinal and λ < wt(κ) is a regular cardinal, then there is a

λ-closed forcing P such that κ is not Shelah in V P.

Proof. By Lemma 3.5 we can assume that there are no Mahlo cardinals above wt(κ). Then

it is easily seen, using Lemma 3.3, that P = Add(λ, wt(κ)+) forces that κ is not a Shelah

cardinal.

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.7. Suppose κ is a Shelah cardinal and wt(κ)-strong. Let j : V → M witness

wt(κ)-strength of κ. Then M |=“κ is a Shelah cardinal”, and there is a normal measure U

on κ such that {λ < κ : λ is a Shelah cardinal} ∈ U .

Proof. The ﬁrst part is trivial as Vwt(κ) ⊆ M. Now let U = {X ⊆ κ : κ ∈ j(X)}. Then U is

a normal measure on κ, and {λ < κ : λ is a Shelah cardinal} ∈ U .

(cid:3)

It follows that if κ is a Shelah cardinal, and Shelah cardinals below κ are bounded in κ,

then κ is not wt(κ)-strong.

Theorem 3.8. Let κ be a Shelah cardinal. The following are equivalent:

(1) {wt(λ) < κ : λ < κ is a Shelah cardinal} is unbounded in κ.

(2) {wt(λ) < wt(κ) : λ < wt(κ) is a Shelah cardinal} is unbounded in wt(κ).

(3) There exists a Shelah cardinal λ with κ < λ < wt(λ) < wt(κ).

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) : Let β < wt(κ). Let f : κ → κ and jf : V → Mf ⊇ Vj(f )(κ), crit(jf ) = κ

be such that β < jf (f )(κ). Now deﬁne g : κ → κ by

AN EASTON LIKE THEOREM IN THE PRESENCE OF SHELAH CARDINALS

g(α) = wt(the least Shelah cardinal above max{α, f (α)}),

and let h(α) = g(α)+ω+4. Let jh : V → Mh witness the Shelahness of κ with respect to h.

Then

and

β < jf (f )(κ) = jh(f )(κ) << jh(g)(κ) < jh(g)(κ)+ω+4 = jh(h)(κ),

jh(g)(κ) = wt(the least Shelah cardinal above max{κ, jh(f )(κ)}).

So Mh |=“there exists a Shelah cardinal, say λ, in the interval (β, jh(g)(κ))”, and since

Mh ⊇ Vjh(h)(κ), λ is in fact a Shelah cardinal in V and wt(λ) < wt(κ).

(2) ⇒ (3) : is trivial.

(3) ⇒ (1) : Let β < κ. Let f : κ → κ be such that f (α) > max{β, α}, and let j : V → M

witness the Shelahness of κ with respect to f . We may further suppose that f is such that

j(f )(κ) > wt(λ)+ω+4. Now

M |=“∃λ(β < λ < wt(λ) < j(κ) and λ is a Shelah cardinal”.

So by elementarily

V |=“∃λ(β < λ < wt(λ) < κ and λ is a Shelah cardinal”.

The result follows.

(cid:3)

4. GCH in the presence of Shelah cardinals

In this section we show that the existence of Shelah cardinals is consistent with GCH (if

there are any), and in fact we will show that the canonical forcing for GCH preserves Shelah

cardinals.

Deﬁnition 4.1. The canonical forcing for GCH is deﬁned as the reverse Easton iteration

of forcings

hhPγ : γ ∈ Oni, hQ

∼γ : γ ∈ Onii

where at each step γ, if γ is a cardinal in V Pγ , then V Pγ |=“Qγ = Add(γ+, 1)”, and

V Pγ |=“Qγ is the trivial forcing notion” otherwise.

Theorem 4.2. The canonical forcing for GCH preserves all Shelah cardinals.

6

M. GOLSHANI

Proof. Let G be P-generic over V , and let f ∈ V [G], f : κ → κ. As we can write P =

Pκ ∗ P

∼[κ,∞), where Pκ is κ-c.c. and (cid:13)Pκ“P

∼[κ,∞) is κ+-closed”, it follows from Lemma 2.1

that there is g ∈ V, g : κ → κ which dominates f . Deﬁne h : κ → κ by

h(α) =the least inaccessible cardinal above max{α, g(α)}.

Since κ is a Shelah cardinal in V and h ∈ V, there exists an elementary embedding j : V → M

with crit(j) = κ such that κM ⊆ M and Vj(h)(κ) ⊆ M. Let δ = j(h)(κ). If γ < δ is a limit

ordinal, then PM

γ = Pγ (where PM = j(P)), however Pδ need not be the same as PM

δ . This

is because though δ is inaccessible in M , δ need not be inaccessible in V .

Claim 4.3. We can take j so that δ is inaccessible in V .

Proof. Let ¯h(α) = h(α) + ω, and let i : V → N witness the Shelahness of κ with respect

to ¯h. Let E be the (κ, i(h)(κ))-extender derived from i and let jE : V → ME ∼= U lt(V, E).

Then crit(jE) = κ,κ M ⊆ M, Vj(h)(κ) ⊆ M and δ is V -inaccessible. So it suﬃces to take

j = jE.

(cid:3)

Thus let’s assume from the beginning that our j has this property. It follows that PM

δ =

Pδ. Let

PM
j(κ) = Pκ ∗ Add

(κ+, 1) ∗ P

∼(κ,δ) ∗ P

where P(κ,δ) is the forcing between κ and δ. Also let G = G<κ ∗G(κ)∗G(κ,δ) ∗Gtail correspond

Let i : V → N be given from the collapse of {j(f )(κ, δ) : f ∈ V } and let k : N → M be the

k∗ : N [G<κ ∗ G(κ)] → M [G<κ ∗ G(κ)].

Let δ0 = i(h)(κ), and note that k(δ0) = δ. Also let

PN

∼

N

(κ+, 1) ∗ P

where PN = i(P). Let:

(1) R ∈ M [G<κ ∗ G(κ)] be the term forcing associated with PM

[δ,j(κ)) with respect to

P(κ,δ); R = PM

[δ,j(κ))/P(κ,δ).

(2) R0 ∈ N [G<κ ∗ G(κ)] be the term forcing associated with PN

[δ0,i(κ)) with respect to

(κ,δ0); R0 = PN
PN

[δ0,i(κ))/PN

(κ,δ0).

Then k∗(R0) = R. Also note that

(1) N [G<κ ∗ G(κ)] |=“2κ = κ+”,

(2) N [G<κ ∗ G(κ)] |=“R0 is i(κ)-c.c. of size i(κ)”,

(3) V [G<κ ∗ G(κ)] |=“R0 is κ+-closed and |i(κ)| = κ+”,

(4) V [G<κ ∗ G(κ)] |=“κN [G<κ ∗ G(κ)] ⊆ N [G<κ ∗ G(κ)].

So there exists H0 ∈ V [G<κ ∗ G(κ)] such that H0 is R0-generic over N [G<κ ∗ G(κ)]. Using

k∗, we can ﬁnd H1 which is R-generic over M [G<κ ∗ G(κ)]. Let

GM

[δ,j(κ)) = { x∼[G<κ ∗ G(κ) ∗ G(κ,δ)] : x∼ ∈ H1}.

GM

[δ,j(κ)) ∈ V [G<δ] and it is PM

[δ,j(κ))-generic over M [G<δ]. It follows that we can lift j to

j∗ : V [G<κ] → M [G<δ ∗ GM

[δ,j(κ))].

Let E be the (κ, j(h)(κ))-extender derived from j∗. Then E ∈ V [G<δ] and E is in fact an

extender over V [G<δ]; this is because forcing with Add(κ+, 1) ∗ P

∼(κ,δ) does not add any new

subsets of κ over V [G<κ]. So let

i∗ : V [G<δ] → N ∗ ∼= U lt(V [G<δ], E)

be the ultrapower embedding. We have

(1) Vi∗(κ) ∩ N ∗ = Vi∗(κ) ∩ U lt(V [G<δ], E),

(2) Vj(h)(κ) ∩ U lt(V [G<δ], E) = Vj(h)(κ) ∩ M [G<δ ∗ GM

[δ,j(κ))],

(3) i∗(h)(κ) = j(h)(κ).

8

M. GOLSHANI

so we can conclude that N ∗ ⊇ Vi∗(h)(κ) ∩ V [G<δ]. Let i∗(Ptail) = PN ∗

tail and let GN ∗

tail be the

ﬁlter generated by i∗[Gtail]. We show that GN ∗

tail is PN ∗

tail-generic over N ∗. So let D ∈ N ∗ be

dense open in PN ∗

tail. Then D = i∗(g)(s) for some s ∈ [j(h)(κ)]<ω and g ∈ V [G<δ], g : [κ]|s| →

V [G<δ]. We may suppose that g(t) is dense open in Ptail, for all t ∈ [κ]|s|. But

V [G<δ] |=“Ptail is δ+-closed”,

so

V [G<δ] |=“Tt g(t) is dense open in Ptail”.

It follows that Gtail ∩ Tt g(t) 6= ∅, which implies GN ∗

tail ∩ D 6= ∅. So we can lift i∗ to get

This means we have

i∗∗ : V [G<δ][Gtail] → N ∗[GN ∗

tail].

i∗∗ : V [G] → N ∗[GN ∗

tail],

which is also deﬁnable in V [G]. Further

Vj(h)(κ) ∩ V [G] = Vi∗(h)(κ) ∩ V [G] ⊆ N ∗[GN ∗

tail].

Hence i∗∗ witnesses κ is a Shelah cardinal in V [G] with respect to f . as f was arbitrary, we

can conclude that κ is a Shelah cardinal in V [G], and the theorem follows.

(cid:3)

5. Easton’s function in the presence of Shelah cardinals

In [6], Menas showed using a master condition argument that locally deﬁnable (see Deﬁni-

tion 6.1 below) Easton functions F can be realized, while preserving supercompact cardinals.

Firedman and Honzik [3] proved the same result for strong cardinals, and Cody [1] proved

an analogous result for Woodin cardinals. Cody and independently Honzik [5], asked if it is

possible to prove the same result for Shelah cardinals. In this section we provide a (partial)

solution to their question.

Recall that an Easton function is a deﬁnable class function F : REG → CARD satisfying:

(1) κ < λ ⇒ F (κ) ≤ F (λ),

(2) cf (F (κ)) > κ.

AN EASTON LIKE THEOREM IN THE PRESENCE OF SHELAH CARDINALS

9

Deﬁnition 5.1. An Easton function F is said to be locally deﬁnable if the following condi-

tion holds:

There is a sentence ψ and a formula φ(x, y) with two free variables such that ψ is true

in V and for all cardinals γ, if H(γ) |=“ψ”, then F [γ] ⊆ γ and

∀α, β ∈ γ (F (α) = β ⇔ H(γ) |=“φ(α, β)”).

Theorem 5.2. (GCH) Assume F is a locally deﬁnable Easton function and let κ be a Shelah

cardinal such that H(κ) |=“ψ”. Then there is a coﬁnality preserving forcing notion P such

that V P realizes F and κ remains a Shelah cardinal in V P.

Remark 5.3.

(1) In [3], the full strength of κ is used to show that κ is closed under F .

As a Shelah cardinal κ is not necessarily even wt(κ)-strong, their argument can not

be applied to show the closure of κ under F , and since this assumption is essential in

preserving large cardinals, we added the extra assumption H(κ) |=“ψ” to guarantee

the closure of κ under F .

(2) We can replace the assumption H(κ) |=“ψ” with the apparently weaker assumption

∃κ ≤ λ < wt(κ), H(λ) |=“ψ”. But using the methods of section 3 (in particular the

proof of Theorem 3.8), we can in fact show that the following are equivalent:

(a) H(κ) |=“ψ”(i.e., κ ∈ Cψ, where Cψ is deﬁned in the proof below),

(b) ∃κ ≤ λ < wt(κ), H(λ) |=“ψ” (i.e. Cψ ∩ [κ, wt(κ)) 6= ∅),

(c) {λ < κ : H(λ) |=“ψ”} is unbounded in κ (i.e., Cψ ∩ κ is unbounded in κ).

Proof. The forcing notion P is essentially the forcing PF deﬁned in [3]. We refer to [3] for the

deﬁnition of PF and its basic properties, and we will apply the deﬁnitions and results from it

without any mention. Let G be PF -generic over V . By [3], the function F is realized in V [G];

thus it remains to show that κ remains a Shelah cardinal in V [G]. Let f ∈ V [G], f : κ → κ.

First, we show that there exists h ∈ V, h : κ → κ which dominates h. We need the following

(see [3] for the deﬁnition of the forcing notion Sacks(κ, λ)).

Claim 5.4. Let f ∈ V Sacks(κ,λ), f : κ → κ. Then there exists g ∈ V, g : κ → κ which

dominates f .

10

M. GOLSHANI

Proof. Let ~p ∈ Sacks(κ, λ) be such that ~p (cid:13)“f
∼

: κ → κ”, where f
∼

is a name for f . Build a

fusion sequence h~pα : α < κi of conditions in Sacks(κ, λ) extending ~p, a sequence hAα : α < κi

of subsets of κ and a sequence hXα : α < κi of subsets of λ such that:

(1) |Aα| ≤ (2α)γ, for some γ < κ,

(2) ~pα (cid:13)“f
∼

(α) ∈ Aα”,

(3) Sα<κ Xα = Sα<κ supp(~pα),

(4) ∀α < κ, ~pα+1 ≤α,Xα ~pα.

By the generalized fusion lemma, [3] Fact 2.18, there exists ~q ∈ Sacks(κ, λ), extending all

~pα’s, α < κ. Deﬁne g : κ → κ by g(α) = sup Aα + 1. Then g ∈ V and ~q (cid:13)“∀α < κ, f
∼

(α) <

g(α)”.

(cid:3)

Then we have PF ∼= PF

κ ∗ PF (κ)

∼

∗ P
∼

F
tail, where

V PF

κ |=“PF (κ) = Sacks(κ, F (κ)) × Qκ<λ<iκ+1,λregular Add(λ, F (λ))”,

and iκ+1 is the (κ + 1)-th closure point of F (note that iκ = κ). Then we have

(1) V PF

κ ∗Sacks∼ (κ,F (κ)) |=“Qκ<λ<iκ+1,λregular Add(λ, F (λ)) is κ+-distributive”,

(2) V

PF
iκ+1 |=“PF

tail is κ+-distributive”.

So by Lemma 2.1 and Claim 5.4, we can ﬁnd h ∈ V, h : κ → κ such that for all α <

κ, f (α) < h(α). Since ψ holds in V , there exists a club of cardinals Cψ such that if λ ∈ Cψ,

then H(λ) |=“ψ”. Also by our assumption, κ ∈ Cψ, and hence it is easily seen that Cψ ∩ κ

is a club of κ. By the results of section 3, Cψ ∩ wt(κ) is also a club of wt(κ). Let Ch be the

class of closure points of h, and note that Ch is a club of cardinals, and Ch ∩ κ is a club of

κ. Deﬁne h∗ : κ → κ by

h∗(α) =the ω-th point of Cψ ∩ Ch above max{α, F (α), h(α)}.

Note that for each α < κ, h∗(α) is a singular cardinal. Set h†(α) = h∗(α)++. Since κ is

a Shelah cardinal in V , and h† ∈ V, there exists an elementary embedding j : V → M ⊇

H(j(h†)(κ)) with crit(j) = κ and κM ⊆ M. It is easily seen that:

(1) j(h†)(κ) = (j(h∗)(κ))++,

(2) j(h∗)(κ) =the ω-th point of j(Cψ ∩ Ch) above max{κ, j(F )(κ), j(h)(κ)},

(3) j(Cψ) ∩ j(h†)(κ) = Cψ ∩ j(h†)(κ), and so j(h∗)(κ) ∈ Cψ.

AN EASTON LIKE THEOREM IN THE PRESENCE OF SHELAH CARDINALS

11

Let β = j(h∗)(κ). Then β > κ is a singular cardinal, H(β) |=“ψ” and j : V → M is a

β++-strong embedding. So the proof of Theorem 3.17 from [3] can be applied to lift j to

some

j∗ : V [G] → M [H] ⊇ H V [G](β+),

for some H which is j(PF )-generic over M . But j∗(f )(κ) < j∗(h∗)(κ) = j(h∗)(κ) = β, and

hence M [H] ⊇ H V [G](j∗(f )(κ)). Thus j∗ witnesses the Shelahness of κ in V [G] with respect

to f . As f was arbitrary, κ remains a Shelah cardinal in V [G].

(cid:3)

6. An indestructibility result for Shelah cardinals

In this section we present an indestructibility result for Shelah cardinals, which involves

some kind of Prikry type forcing notions.

Deﬁnition 6.1. Let (P, ≤, ≤∗) be a set with two partial orders so that ≤∗⊆≤ . (P, ≤) is a

used as a forcing notion.

(1) (P, ≤, ≤∗) is weakly κ-closed, if (P, ≤∗) is κ-closed.

(2) (P, ≤, ≤∗) satisﬁes the Prikry property, if for any p ∈ P and statement σ of the

forcing language (P, ≤), there exists q ≤∗ p deciding σ.

Note that any κ-closed forcing notion can be turned into a weakly κ-closed Prikry type

forcing notion, simply by setting ≤∗=≤ . In [4], it is shown that, it is consistent that a

strong cardinal κ is indestructible under weakly κ+-closed Prikry type forcing notions.

Given a set of functions A ⊆κκ, call κ is A-Shelah, if for each function f ∈ A, there is

an elementary embedding witnessing the Shelahness of κ with respect to f ; so κ is a Shelah

cardinal iﬀ it is a κκ-Shelah cardinal. At the end of their paper, Gitik and Shelah have

claimed that the same argument can be applied to show that if A = (κκ) ∩ V, then the fact

that a cardinal κ is A-Shelah can become indestructible under any weakly κ+-closed Prikry

type forcing notions. The next lemma, shows that this is not in fact true.

Lemma 6.2. Suppose κ is a Shelah cardinal. Then there is a weakly κ+-closed Prikry type

forcing notion P, such that in V P, there are no measurable cardinals in above κ; in particular

κ does not remain (κκ) ∩ V -Shelah in the generic extension.

12

M. GOLSHANI

Proof. By Lemma 3.5 we can assume that there are no Mahlo cardinals above wt(κ).. Then

forcing with Add(κ+, wt(κ)+) is as required. In fact we can even do not change the power

function and preserve all cardinals if we force with the Prikry product of forcing notions PUλ,

where λ ranges over all measurable cardinals in (κ, wt(κ)), Uλ is some ﬁxed norml measure

on λ, and PUλ is the corresponding Prikry forcing notion.

(cid:3)

We now show that it is consistent that the full Shelahness of κ is indestructible under

any weakly κ+-closed Prikry type forcing notion of size < wt(κ).

Theorem 6.3. Suppose GCH holds and κ is a Shelah cardinal. Then there exists a generic

extension V [G] of V , in which κ remains a Shelah cardinal, and its Shelahness is indestruc-

tible under any weakly κ+-closed Prikry type forcing notion of size < wt(κ).

The proof uses the existence of some kind of Laver functions for Shelah cardinals. The

following can be proved as for supercompact or Strong cardinals

Lemma 6.4. There exists a partial function L : κ → Vκ, such that for every x ∈ Vwt(κ)

and every λ < wt(κ) with |tc(x)| < λ, there exists f : κ → κ and an elementary embedding

j : V → M ⊇ H(j(f )(κ)) with crit(j) = κ, such that j(f )(κ) > λ and j(L)(κ) = x.

We may further suppose that dom(L) just contains inaccessible cardinals, and that for all

λ ∈ dom(L), L ↾ λ ⊆ Vλ.

We are now ready to complete the proof of Theorem 6.3.

Proof of Theorem 6.3. Let

∼α : α < κii
be an Easton support Prikry iteration of length κ, such that

Pκ = hhPα : α ≤ κi, hQ

(1) If α /∈ dom(L), then (cid:13)Pα“Q

∼α is the trivial forcing”,

(2) Suppose α ∈ dom(L) and L(α) = (Q

∈ Vλ is a Pα-name. Then

• If (cid:13)Pα“Q

is a weakly α+-closed Prikry type forcing notion, then Q

∼α = Q

”,

• Otherwise (cid:13)Pα“Q

∼α is the trivial forcing”.

Let G be Pκ-generic over V . We show that the model V [G] is as required. Thus ﬁx in V [G],

a weakly κ+-closed Prikry type forcing notion Q ∈ V [G]wt(κ), let H be Q-generic over V [G],

and let f : κ → κ, f ∈ V [G][H]. Let λ be such that

AN EASTON LIKE THEOREM IN THE PRESENCE OF SHELAH CARDINALS

(1) κ < λ < wt(κ),

(2) Q ∈ V [G]λ,

(3) λ is an inaccessible cardinal of V .

As Pκ satisﬁes the κ-c.c., and Q adds no new functions from κ to κ, there is some g : κ → κ

in V which dominates f , and we can further suppose that for all α < κ, g(α) > f (α) + ω.

Now, using Lemma 6.4, let h ∈ V, h : κ → κ and j : V → M ⊇ Vj(h)(κ) with crit(j) = κ be

such that:

(1) For some inaccessible cardinal i(α) > g(α), h(α) is the least ג-ﬁxed point above i(α),

(2) j(i)(κ) > λ,

(3) j(L)(κ) = (Q
∼

, j(i)(κ)), where Q
∼

is some ﬁxed Pκ-name for Q with Q
∼

∈ Vλ ⊆ Vj(i)(κ).

The proof of the main theorem in [4] shows that we can lift j to some j∗ : V [G][H] →

M ∗ ⊇ V [G][H]j(i)(κ). Since j(f )(κ) < j(g)(κ) < j(i)(κ), so j∗ witnesses the Shelahness of κ

in V [G][H] with respect to f . Since f was arbitrary, we conclude that κ remains a Shelah

cardinal in V [G][H], and the theorem follows.

(cid:3)

We close the paper with the following question.

Question 6.5. Let κ be a Shelah cardinal. Is there a generic extension in which κ is the

unique Shelah cardinal.

We may note that the answer to the question is trivial if the Shelah cardinals below κ

are bounded in κ. The problem becomes diﬃcult when {wt(λ) : λ < κ is a Shelah cardinal}

is unbounded in κ (see Theorem 3.8).
