Abstract

Let Pt be the (Neumann) diﬀusion semigroup Pt generated by a weighted Laplacian
on a complete connected Riemannian manifold M without boundary or with a convex
boundary. It is well known that the Bakry-Emery curvature is bounded below by a
positive constant λ > 0 if and only if

Wp(µ1Pt, µ2Pt) ≤ e−λtWp(µ1, µ2),

t ≥ 0, p ≥ 1

holds for all probability measures µ1 and µ2 on M , where Wp is the Lp Wasserstein
distance induced by the Riemannian distance. In this paper, we prove the exponential
contraction

Wp(µ1Pt, µ2Pt) ≤ ce−λtWp(µ1, µ2), p ≥ 1, t ≥ 0

for some constants c, λ > 0 for a class of diﬀusion semigroups with negative curvature
where the constant c is essentially larger than 1. Similar results are derived for SDEs
with multiplicative noise by using explicit conditions on the coeﬃcients rather than
the intrinsic curvature, such that the recent study on W1-contraction for SDEs with
additive noise is extended and improved.

Introduction

Let M be a d-dimensional connected complete Riemannian manifold possibly with a convex
boundary ∂M. Let ρ be the Riemannian distance. Consider L = ∆ + Z for the Laplace-
Beltrami operator ∆ and some C 1-vector ﬁeld Z such that the (reﬂecting) diﬀusion process
generated by L is non-explosive. Then the associated Markov semigroup Pt is the (Neumann
if ∂M 6= ∅) semigroup generated by L on M. In particular, it is the case when the curvature
of L is bounded below; that is,

(1.1)

RicZ := Ric − ∇Z ≥ K

holds for some constant K ∈ R. Here and throughout the paper, we write T ≥ h for a (not
necessarily symmetric) 2-tensor T and a function h provided

T (X, X) ≥ h(x)|X|2, X ∈ TxM, x ∈ M.

There exist many inequalities on Pt which are equivalent to the curvature condition (1.1),
see [5, 19, 22, 39] for details. In particular, for any constant K ∈ R, the Wasserstein distance
inequality

(1.2)

Wp(µ1Pt, µ2Pt) ≤ e−KtWp(µ1, µ2),

t ≥ 0, p ≥ 1, µ1, µ2 ∈ P(M)

is equivalent to the curvature condition (1.1). Here, P(M) is the class of all probability
measures on M; Wp is the Lp-Warsserstein distance induced by ρ, i.e.,
π∈C (µ1,µ2)kρkLp(π), µ1, µ2 ∈ P(M),

Wp(µ1, µ2) :=

inf

where C (µ1, µ2) is the class of all couplings of µ1 and µ2; and for a Markov operator P on
Bb(M) (i.e. P is a positivity-preserving linear operator with P 1 = 1),

(νP )(A) := ν(P 1A), A ∈ B(M), ν ∈ P(M),

where ν(f ) := RM f dν for f ∈ L1(ν). In some references, νP is also denoted by P ∗ν. In
the sequel we will use P ∗t to stand for the adjoint operator of Pt in L2(µ) for the invariant
probability measure µ, hence adopt the notation νP rather than P ∗ν to avoid confusion.
When the curvature is positive (i.e. K > 0), (1.2) implies the Wp-exponential contraction of
Pt for p ≥ 1.

In this paper, we aim to consider the case when (1.1) only holds for some negative

constant K, and to prove the exponential contraction

(1.3)

Wp(µ1Pt, µ2Pt) ≤ ce−λtWp(µ1, µ2),

t ≥ 0, p ≥ 1, µ1, µ2 ∈ P(M)

for some constants c, λ > 0. It is crucial that the exponential rate λ is independent of p.
Due to the equivalence of (1.1) and (1.2), in the negative curvature case it is essential that
c > 1.

2

According to [34], even when RicZ is unbounded below, i.e. RicZ goes to −∞ when
ρo := ρ(o,·) → ∞ for a ﬁxed o ∈ M, there may exist the log-Sobolev inequality which
implies the exponentially convergence of Pt in entropy. This suggests that (1.3) may also
hold for a class of diﬀusion semigroups with negative curvature.

Recently, some eﬀorts have been made in this direction for M = Rd, see [10, 11, 17].
More precisely, let Pt be the diﬀusion semigroup for the solution to the following SDE on
Rd:

dXt = √2 dBt + Z(Xt)dt,

where Bt is the d-dimensional Brownian motion and Z : Rd → Rd is continuous. If there
exist constants K1, K2, r0 > 0 such that

(1.4)

hZ(x) − Z(y), x − yi ≤ 1|x−y|≤r0(K1 + K2)|x − y|2 − K2|x − y|2, x, y ∈ Rd,

then due to [10, 11] we have

(1.5)

W1(δxPt, δyPt) ≤ ce−λt|x − y|, x, y ∈ Rd, t ≥ 0

for some constants c, λ > 0, where δx is the Dirac measure at point x.
Indeed, [10, 11]
proved the W1-exponential contraction with respect to a modiﬁed distance f (|x − y|) in
place of |x − y| as constructed in [7, 8] for estimates of the spectral gap using the coupling
by reﬂection. Under condition (1.4) the modiﬁed distance is comparable with the usual one
so that (1.5) follows.

In Luo and Wang [17] the estimate (1.5) was extended as

(1.6)

Wp(δxPt, δyPt) ≤ ce−λt/p(|x − y| + |x − y|

1

p ), x, y ∈ Rd, t ≥ 0, p ≥ 1

for some constants c, λ > 0. Comparing with (1.3) which is equivalent to

Wp(δxPt, δyPt) ≤ ce−λt|x − y|, p ≥ 1, x, y ∈ Rd, t ≥ 0

according to [16] (see Proposition 3.1 below), (1.6) is less sharp for small |x− y| and/or large
p. It is open whether (1.4), or in the Riemannian setting that RicZ is uniformly positive
outside a compact domain, implies (1.3) for some constants c, λ > 0.

As in [15, 16], we will consider the Warsserstein distances induced by Young functions in

the class

N := nΦ ∈ C 1([0,∞); [0,∞)) : Φ′ is nonnegative and increasing,
= ∞o.

Φ(0) = 0,Φ(r) > 0 for r > 0, lim
r→∞

For any Φ ∈ N and a measure ν on M, consider the gauge norm in LΦ(ν) :

kfkLΦ(ν) := inf nr > 0 : ν(cid:0)Φ(r−1|f|)(cid:1) ≤ 1o,

inf ∅ := ∞.

3

In particular, we have kfkLΦp (ν) = kfkLp(ν) for Φp(r) := rp, p ∈ (1,∞). This is the reason
why we do not take Φp(r) = 1
prp in the characterization of Legendre conjugates. We extend
the notion Φp to p = 1,∞ by letting Φ1(r) = r, Φ∞ = limp→∞ Φp and kfkLΦp (ν) = kfkLp(ν)
for all p ∈ [1,∞]. Now, let

WΦ(µ1, µ2) =

inf

π∈C (µ1,µ2)kρkLΦ(π), Φ ∈ ¯N := N ∪ {Φ1, Φ∞}.

In particular, WΦp = Wp for p ∈ [1,∞]. We aim to prove the exponential decay
x, y ∈ M, t ≥ 0, Φ ∈ ¯N
(1.7)
when (1.1) only holds for a negative constant K, where Φ−1 is the inverse of Φ(6= Φ∞) and
we set Φ−1
∞

WΦ(δxPt, δyPt) ≤ cΦ−1(1)e−λtρ(x, y),

(1) = 1 by convention.

To extend condition (1.4) to the Riemannian setting, consider the index

I(x, y) = Z ρ(x,y)

0

d−1

Xi=1 n|∇ ˙γJi|2 − hR( ˙γ, Ji) ˙γ, Jiio(γs)ds, x, y ∈ M,

where ρ is the Riemannian distance, R is the curvature tensor; γ : [0, ρ(x, y)] → M is the
minimal geodesic from x to y with unit speed; {Ji}d−1
i=1 are Jacobi ﬁelds along γ such that

Ji(y) = Px,y Ji(x),

i = 1, . . . , d − 1

holds for the parallel transform Px,y : TxM → TyM along the geodesic γ, and { ˙γ(s), Ji(s) :
1 ≤ i ≤ d − 1} (s = 0, ρ(x, y)) is an orthonormal basis of the tangent space (at points x and
y, respectively).
Note that when (x, y) ∈ Cut(M), i.e. x is in the cut-locus of y, the minimal geodesic
may be not unique. As a convention in the literature, all conditions on the index I are given
outside Cut(M). We now extend condition (1.4) to the non-ﬂat case as follows: for some
constants K1, K2 > 0,

(1.8)

IZ(x, y) := I(x, y) + hZ,∇ρ(·, y)i(x) + hZ,∇ρ(x,·, )i(y)

≤ (cid:8)(K1 + K2)1{ρ(x,y)≤r0} − K2(cid:9)ρ(x, y), x, y ∈ M.

In the ﬂat case we have I(x, y) = 0 and ρ(x, y) = |x− y|, so that this condition reduces back
to (1.4). Moreover, the curvature condition (1.1) is equivalent to

so that (1.8) implies RicZ ≥ −(K1 + K2).

IZ(x, y) ≤ −Kρ(x, y), x, y ∈ M,

In the next section, we state our main results and present examples. With condition
(1.8) we ﬁrst extend the main results of [10, 17] to the present Riemannian setting and
give the exponential convergence of Pt in W2. Under the ultracontractivity and condition
(1.1) for some K < 0, our the second result ensures the desired inequality (1.7). Finally,
we extend these results to SDEs with multiplicative noise by using explicit conditions on
the coeﬃcients. To prove these results, we make some preparations in Section 3. Complete
proofs of the main results are addressed in Sections 4-6 respectively.

2 Main Results and examples

We ﬁrst consider the Riemannian setting, then extend to SDEs with multiplicative noise by
using explicit conditions on the coeﬃcients instead of the less explicit curvature condition.

2.1 The Riemannian setting

We start with condition (1.8). Besides the extension of (1.6), this condition also implies
the hypercontractivity and the exponential convergence in W2 for the semigroup Pt. For
a measure µ and constants p, q ≥ 1, let k · kLp(µ)→Lq (µ) stand for the operator norm form
Lp(µ) to Lq(µ). Recall that Pt is called hypercontractive if it has a unique invariant prob-
ability measure µ and kPtkL2(µ)→L4(µ) = 1 holds for large t > 0. By interpolation theorem,
kPtkL2(µ)→L4(µ) = 1 can be replaced by kPtkLp(µ)→Lq (µ) = 1 for some ∞ > q > p > 1.
Theorem 2.1. Let (1.8) hold for some constants K1, K2 and r0 > 0. Then:
(1) There exist two constants c, λ > 0 such that for any Φ ∈ ¯N and x, y ∈ M,
cρ(x, y)o,

WΦ(δxPt, δyPt) ≤ inf nr > 0 :

t ≥ 0.

In particular,

Wp(δxPt, δyPt) ≤ {ce−λt}

(2) Pt has a unique invariant probability measure µ and the log-Sobolev inequality

(2.2)

µ(f 2 log f 2) ≤ Cµ(|∇f|2) + µ(f 2) log µ(f 2), f ∈ C 1

holds for some constant C > 0. Consequently, Pt is hypercontractive.

(3) There exist constants c, λ > 0 such that

(2.3)

W2(νPt, µ) ≤ ce−λtW2(ν, µ),

t ≥ 0, ν ∈ P(M).

To illustrate this result, we present below a consequence with explicit curvature conditions
in the spirit of [34]. These conditions allow RicZ to be negative everywhere, for instance,
when −C1 ≤ Ric ≤ −C2 and C2 > −∇Z ≥ δ for some constants C1 > C2 > δ > 0. As
indicated in Introduction that (1.8) implies RicZ ≥ −(K1 + K2), so in the following corollary
we assume that RicZ is bounded below.
Corollary 2.2. Assume that RicZ is bounded below. Let ρo = ρ(o,·) for a ﬁxed point o ∈ M.
If there exist constants σ > 0 and δ > σ(1 + √2)√d − 1 such that

(2.4)

− ∇Z ≥ −δ and Ric ≥ −σ2ρ2

o outside a compact set,

then all assertions in Theorem 2.1 hold.

5

Next, we introduce suﬃcient conditions for (1.7) which allow RicZ to be negative. Due
to technical reason, we will need the ultracontractivity of Pt, which is essentially stronger
than the hypercontractivity. We call Pt ultracontractive if kPtkL1(µ)→L∞(µ) < ∞ for all t > 0.
The ultracontractivity implies that Pt has a density pt(x, y) with respect to µ (called heat
kernel) and

kptkL∞(µ×µ) = kPtkL1(µ)→L∞(µ) < ∞,

t > 0.

In references (see e.g. [9]), the ultracontractivity is also deﬁned by kPtkL2(µ)→L∞(µ) < ∞ for
t > 0. When Pt is symmetric in L2(µ) we have

(2.5)

kPtkL1(µ)→L∞(µ) ≤ kPt/2k2

L2(µ)→L∞(µ),

t > 0,

so that these two deﬁnitions are equivalent. However, when Pt is non-symmetric, the former
might be stronger than the latter. The appearance of the ultracontractivity in our study is
very nature: by Theorem 2.3(1) we already have (1.7) for Φ = Φ1 (the weakest case), and
by the ultracontractivity we are able to deduce the inequality from Φ1 to Φ∞ (the strongest
case). On the other hand, the result also indicates that (1.7) implies the hypercontractivity
of Pt.

Theorem 2.3. Assume that RicZ is bounded below.
(1) If Pt is ultracontractive, then there exist constants c, λ > 0 such that for any Φ ∈ ¯N ,

WΦ(δxPt, δyPt) ≤ ce−λt minnΦ−1(1)ρ(x, y), GΦ(t)o,

t > 0, x, y ∈ M

(2.6)

holds for

GΦ(t) := supnr > 0 : (µ × µ)(cid:16)Φ(cid:0)r−1ρ(cid:1)(cid:17) ≤ kPt/2k−2

L1(µ)→L∞(µ)o.

Consequently, for any p ∈ [1,∞], t ≥ 0 and µ1, µ2 ∈ P(M),
(2.7)

Wp(µ1Pt, µ2Pt) ≤ ce−λt minnWp(µ1, µ2), kρkLp(µ×µ)kPt/2k

L1(µ)→L∞(µ)o.

(2) On the other hand, if there exist constants c, λ > 0 such that

(2.8)

W∞(δxPt, δyPt) ≤ ce−λtρ(x, y), x, y ∈ M, t ≥ 0,

then the log-Sobolev inequality (3.3) holds for c = 2c2

λ , so that Pt is hypercontractive.
We note that in Theorem 2.3(1) we have kρkLp(µ×µ) < ∞ for p ∈ [1,∞). Indeed, since
RicZ is bounded below, by [23, Theorem 2.1] the ultracontractivity implies the super log-
Sobolev inequality (3.2) below, so that due to Herbst we have (µ× µ)(erρ2) < ∞ for all r > 0
(see e.g. [1]). Therefore, GΦ(t) < ∞ for t > 0 and Φ ∈ N satisfying

lim sup

r→∞

In the symmetric case (i.e. Z = ∇V for some V ∈ C 2(M)), explicit suﬃcient conditions
for the ultracontractivity have been introduced in [34] by using the dimension-free Harnack
inequality in the sense of [30]. Together with a suitable exponential estimate on the diﬀusion
process, this inequality implies kPtkL2(µ)→L∞(µ) < ∞ for t > 0 and thus, Pt is ultracontractive
due to (2.5). The conditions can be formulated as

(2.9)

− ∇Z ≥ Ψ1 ◦ ρo and Ric ≥ −Ψ2 ◦ ρo hold outside a compact subset of M,

where Ψ1, Ψ2 : (0,∞) → (0,∞) are increasing functions such that

Since (2.5) fails for non-symmetric semigroups, we apply the inequality

kPtkL1(µ)→L∞(µ) ≤ kPt/2kL1(µ)→L2(µ)kPt/2kL2(µ)→L∞(µ)

due to the semigroup property. So, to ensure the ultracontractivity, we need an additional
condition implying kPtkL1(µ)→L2(µ) < ∞ (see Corollary 2.4(2) below).

To estimate GΦ(t) in (2.6) using Ψ1, we introduce

and C > 0.

(1) If Pt is symmetric, i.e. Z = ∇V for some V ∈ C 2(M), then there exist constants

c, λ > 0 such that (2.6) and (2.7) hold for

To conclude this part, we present a simple example to illustrate Corollary 2.4.

Example 2.1. Let M have non-positive sectional curvatures and a pole o ∈ M. Let

hold with Ψ1(r) = c1rε for some constant c1 > 0. According to Corollary 2.4, there exist
constants c, λ > 0 such that for any p ≥ 1,

2.2 SDEs with multiplicative noise

Consider the following SDE on Rd:

(2.15)

dXt = Z(Xt)dt + σ(Xt)dBt,

where Bt is the m-dimensional Brownian motion, Z : Rd → Rd and σ : Rd → Rd ⊗ Rm (the
space of d × m-matrices) are locally Lipshitz such that

kσk2

HS(x) + 2hZ(x), xi ≤ C(1 + |x|2), x ∈ Rd

8

holds for some constant C > 0, where and in the following, k · kHS and k · k denote the
Hilbert-Schmidt and the operator norms respectively. Then the SDE has a unique solution
{Xt(x)}t≥0 for every initial point x ∈ Rd. Let Pt be the associated Markov semigroup:

Ptf (x) := E[f (Xt(x))],

t ≥ 0, x ∈ Rd, f ∈ Bb(Rd).

When a := 1

2σσ∗ is invertible, we may consider the metric induced by the diﬀusion

coeﬃcients of the SDE (2.15):

g(∂i, ∂j) := (a−1)ij, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ d.
Then the generator of the solutions is formulated as L = 1
2∆g + Z′ for ∆g the associated
Laplace-Beltrami operator and Z′ some vector ﬁeld, so that results presented above in the
Riemannian setting can be applied. However, since the associated curvature condition is less
explicit, we prefer to present results using explicit conditions on the coeﬃcients σ and Z.

Corresponding to that (1.1) implies (1.2) in the Riemannian setting, we have the following

assertion.

Theorem 2.5. Let p ∈ [1,∞). If

(2.16)

1

2n(p − 2)kσ(x) − σ(y)k2 + kσ(x) − σ(y)k2
≤ −Kp|x − y|2, x, y ∈ Rd

HSo + hZ(x) − Z(y), x − yi

holds for some constant Kp ∈ R, then

Wp(µ1Pt, µ2Pt) ≤ e−KptWp(µ1, µ2),

t ≥ 0, µ1, µ2 ∈ P(Rd).

Note that this result does apply to p = ∞ when σ is non-constant.
Next, as in the Riemannian case, we intend to prove the exponential contraction in Wp
when (2.16) only holds for some negative constant Kp. To this end, we need the SDE to be
non-degenerate. The following result contains analogous assertions in Theorems 2.1 and 2.3,
where the ﬁrst assertion extends (1.5) to the multiplicative noise setting.

Theorem 2.6. Assume that σσ∗ ≥ λ2
(1) If there exist constants K1, K2, r0 > 0 such that Z and σ0 := pσσ∗ − λ2

0I for some constant λ0 > 0.

0I satisfy

(2.17)

2nkσ0(x) − σ0(y)k2
≤ (cid:8)(K1 + K2)1{|x−y|≤r0} − K2(cid:9)|x − y|2, x, y ∈ Rd,

HS − kσ0(x) − σ0(y)k2o + hZ(x) − Z(y), x − yi

then there exist constants c, λ > 0 such that

W1(µ1Pt, µ2Pt) ≤ ce−λtW1(µ1, µ2),

t ≥ 0, µ1, µ2 ∈ P(Rd).

9

(2) Let Pt have a unique invariant probability measure µ such that the log-Sobolev inequality

(2.18)

µ(f 2 log f 2) ≤ Cµ(|σ∗∇f|2), f ∈ C 1

b (Rd), µ(f 2) = 1

holds for some constant C > 0. If there exists a constant K > 0 such that

(2.19)

1
2kσ(x) − σ(y)k2

HS + hZ(x) − Z(y), x − yi ≤ K|x − y|2, x, y ∈ Rd,

then (2.3) holds for some constants c, λ > 0 and M = Rd.

(3) Let Pt be ultracontractive and let (2.19) hold for some constant K > 0. Then there
exist a constant λ > 0 such that for any p ∈ [1,∞), condition (2.16) implies (2.7) for
some constant c = c(p) > 0, and all t ≥ 0, µ1, µ2 ∈ P(Rd).

According to [21, Lemma 3.3], we have

(2.20)

kσ0(x) − σ0(y)k2 ≤

1
4λ0k(σσ∗)(x) − (σσ∗)(y)k2

HS, x, y ∈ Rd.

Combining this with k · k2
explicit condition:

HS ≤ dk · k2, we see that (2.17) follows from the following more

3 Preparations

This section includes some propositions which will be used to prove the results introduced
in Section 2. We ﬁrst recall a link between the Wasserstein distance and gradient estimates
due to [16], then deduce the hyperboundedness and the exponential convergence in entropy
from the log-Sobolev inequality for non-symmetric diﬀusion semigroups, and ﬁnally prove the
exponential contraction in gradient for ultracontractive semigroups in a general framework
including both diﬀusion and jump Markov semigroups.

3.1 Wasserstein distance and gradient inequalities

Let (E, ρ) be a geodesic Polish space, i.e.
it is a Polish space and for any two diﬀerent
points x, y ∈ E, there exists a continuous curve γ : [0, 1] → E such that γ0 = x, γ1 = y
and ρ(γs, γt) = |s − t|ρ(x, y) for s, t ∈ [0, 1]. Then for any f ∈ Lipb(E), the class of bounded
Lipschitz functions on E, the length of gradient

|∇f|(x) := lim sup
ρ(x,y)↓0

|f (x) − f (y)|

ρ(x, y)

is measurable. Moreover, let P (x, dy) be a Markov transition kernel and deﬁne the Markov
operator

P f (x) := ZE

f (y)P (x, dy), x ∈ E, f ∈ Bb(E).

3.2 Hyperboundedness and exponential convergence in entropy

When Pt is symmetric, it is well known that the hyperbounddeness, exponential convergence
in entropy and the log-Sobolev inequality are equivalent each other, see [5, 33] and refer-
ences within. In the non-symmetric case, the log-Sobolev inequality implies the former two
properties if the generator L and the symmetric part of the Dirichlet form E satisfy

(3.1)

− µ((1 + log f )Lf ) ≥ c0E(cid:0)pf ,pf(cid:1) and
− µ(f p−1Lf ) =

c0(p − 1)

E (f

2 ), p > 1, f ∈ D

for some constant c0 > 0 and a reasonable class D of non-negative bounded functions, which
is stable under Pt and dense in Lp
+(µ) := {f ∈ Lp(µ) : f ≥ 0} for any p ≥ 1, see e.g. [13].
In applications, it may be not easy to ﬁgure out the class D such that (3.1) holds. But in
general this condition can be replaced by the following approximation formula Lemma 3.2
in the spirit of [24].

Now, consider the (Neumann) semigroup Pt generated by L := ∆+ Z for a local bounded

vector ﬁeld Z such that Pt has a unique invariant probability measure µ. Let

D0 = (cid:8)f ∈ C∞0 (M) : f satisﬁes the Neumann condition if ∂M 6= ∅(cid:9).

Then (L, D0) is dissipative (thus, closable) in L1(µ) with closure (L, D1(L)) generating Pt in
L1(µ), see e.g. [26] and references within. Let

D = {f ∈ D1(L) ∩ L∞(µ) : f ≥ 0}.

Lemma 3.2. Let f ∈ D and ψ ∈ C∞b ([essµ inf f,∞)). There exists a sequence {fn}n≥1 ⊂ D0
with inf fn = inf f such that fn → f in Lm(µ) for any m ≥ 1, Lfn → Lf in L1(µ), and

µ(ψ(f )Lf ) = − lim
n→∞

µ(ψ′(fn)|∇fn|2).

12

Proof. Since f ∈ D ⊂ D1(L)∩ L∞(µ), there exists a uniformly bounded sequence {fn}n≥1 ⊂
D0 such that inf fn = essµ inf f and fn → f, Lfn → Lf in L1(µ). By the uniform bounded-
ness, fn → f in Lm(µ) for any m ≥ 1. Since ψ ∈ C∞b ([inf fn,∞)),

gn := Z fn

inf fn

ψ(s)ds ∈ Dc := {g + c : c ∈ R, g ∈ D0} ⊂ D2(L).

This implies µ(Lgn) = 0 since µ is Pt-invariant. So, by the dominated convergence theorem,

µ(ψ(f )Lf ) = lim
n→∞

µ(ψ(fn)Lfn) = lim
n→∞

µ(Lgn − ψ′(fn)|∇fn|2) = − lim
n→∞

µ(ψ′(fn)|∇fn|2).

Proposition 3.3. Let Z be a locally bounded vector ﬁeld such that the (Neumann) semigroup
Pt generated by L := ∆ + Z has a unique invariant probability measure µ.

(1) If the super log-Sobolev inequality

(3.2)

µ(f 2 log f 2) ≤ rµ(|∇f|2) + β(r), r > 0, f ∈ C 1

b (M), µ(f 2) = 1.

C((p, q); (0,∞)) such that t := R q

µ((Ptg) log Ptg) ≤ e−4t/Cµ(g log g), g ∈ Bb(M), g ≥ 0, µ(g) = 1.

so that the above inequality becomes

for γ(p) := β(4c(p)(1−p−1))
for any p ≥ 1, the desired assertion follows from the proof of [13, Corollary 3.13].
ψ(s) = 1 + log s, and using (3.3), we obtain

This implies the desired exponential estimate.

3.3 Exponential contraction in gradient

In this part, we consider a general framework including both diﬀusion and jump processes.
Let (E, F , µ) be a separable complete probability space, and let Pt be a Markov semigroup
on L2(µ) with µ as invariant probability measure. Let (L, D(L)) be the generator of Pt in
L2(µ). We assume that there exists an algebra A ⊂ D(L) such that

(i) 1 ∈ A , A is dense in L2(µ) and the algebra induced by
D := {Psf : s ≥ 0, f ∈ A }

is contained in D(L).

(ii) Γ(f, g) := 1

2 (L(f g)−f Lg−gLf ) gives rise to a non-degenerate positive deﬁnite bilinear
form on D × D; i.e., for any f ∈ D, Γ(f, f ) ≥ 0 and it equals to 0 if and only if f is
constant.

In particular, when Pt is the (Neumann) semigroup generated by L := ∆ + Z on M with
RicZ bounded below, the assumption holds for

A := {f + c : f ∈ C∞0 (M) satisfying the Neumann condition if ∂M 6= ∅, c ∈ R}.

Under the above conditions,

E (f, g) := µ(Γ(f, g)), f, g ∈ A

14

is closable and the closure (E , D(E )) is a conservative symmetric Dirichlet form. Although
Pt is not associated to (E , D(E )) when it is non-symmetric, we have

(3.5)

d
dt

µ((Ptf )2) = −2E (Ptf, Ptf ),

t ≥ 0, f ∈ D.

If kPtkL1(µ)→L∞(µ) < ∞, then Pt has a heat kernel pt(x, y) with respect to µ, i.e.

Ptf = ZE

pt(·, y)f (y)µ(dy), f ∈ L2(µ),

and

essµ×µ sup pt = kPtkL1(µ)→L∞(µ) < ∞.

We consider the “gradient” length |∇Γf| = pΓ(f, f ) induced by Γ. Note that for jump
processes the length is non-local and thus essentially diﬀerent from the usual gradient length.
As shown below that estimates of |∇ΓPt| have close link to functional inequalities of the
associated Dirichlet form.

Proposition 3.4. Assume that there exist t1 > 0 and η ∈ C([0,∞); (0,∞)) such that
(3.6)

|∇ΓPtf|2 ≤ η(t)Pt|∇Γf|2, t ≥ 0, f ∈ D.

kPt1kL1(µ)→L∞(µ) < ∞,

Then there exist constants c, λ, t1 > 0 such that for any q ≥ 1 and ηq ∈ C([0,∞); (0,∞)),
the gradient estimate

(3.7)

implies

(3.8)

|∇ΓPtf|2 ≤ ηq(t)(Pt|∇Γf|q)

Proof. (a) We ﬁrst prove

(3.9)

E (Ptf, Ptf ) ≤ Ce−λtE (f, f ), f ∈ D, t ≥ 0

for some constants C, λ > 0. By the second inequality in (3.6), for any t > 0 and f ∈ D we
have

d
ds

Ps(Pt−sf )2 = 2Ps|∇ΓPt−sf|2 ≤ 2η(t − s)Pt|∇Γf|2, s ∈ [0, t].

Integrating both sides over [0, t] leads to

Ptf 2 ≤ (Ptf )2 + C(t)Pt|∇Γf|2, C(t) := 2Z t

0

η(s)ds, t > 0.

Taking t = t1 and noting that µ is the invariant probability measure of Pt, we obtain

(3.10)

µ(f 2) ≤ C(t1)E (f, f ) + kPt1k2

1→∞

µ(|f|)2, f ∈ D.

15

Since D(E ) is the closure of D under the E1-norm, this inequality also holds for f ∈ D(E ).
By condition (ii), the symmetric Dirichlet form is irreducible. So, according to [38, Corollary
1.2] the defective Poincar´e inequality (3.10) implies the Poincar´e inequality

(3.11)

µ(f 2) ≤

1
λ

E (f, f ) + µ(f )2, f ∈ D(E )

for some constant λ > 0. By (3.5) and that D is dense in L2(µ), the Poincar´e inequality is
equivalent to

(3.12)
On the other hand, by the second inequality in (3.6), for any t > 0 and f ∈ D we have

kPtf − µ(f )k2 ≤ e−λtkf − µ(f )k2,

t ≥ 0, f ∈ L2(µ).

d

Ps(Pt−sf )2 = 2Ps|∇ΓPt−sf|2 ≥ 2η(s)|∇ΓPtf|2, s ∈ [0, t].

So,

t > 0, f ∈ D.

Using Ptf − µ(f ) to replace f and integrating with respect to µ, we obtain

E (P2tf, P2tf ) ≤ kPtf − µ(f )k2
0 η(s)ds
Combining this with (3.12) and (3.11) we arrive at
E (Ptf, Ptf ) ≤ c1e−λtE (f, f ),

t > 0, f ∈ D.

t ≥ 1, f ∈ D

for some constant c1 > 0; that is, (3.9) holds for t > 1. Finally, (??) implies (3.9) for t ∈ [0, 1].

(b) Next, we intend to ﬁnd out a constant t0 ≥ t1 such that
(µ × µ)-a.e., t ≥ t0.
Indeed, by (3.12) and the ﬁrst inequality in (3.6), we obtain

1
2 ≤ pt ≤ 2,

(3.13)

where c0 := kPt1kL1(µ)→L∞(µ). This implies the desired assertion for t0 > 0 such that c2

(c) Finally, combining (3.6), (3.13), (3.9) and (3.11), we obtain

for some constants c1, c2, c3 > 0. Then (3.8) holds for t2 = 2t0.

4 Proof of Theorem 2.1

The ﬁrst assertion is a generalization of the main result in [17] where M = Rd is considered.
As in [17], the key point of the proof is to construct a coupling by parallel transform for long
distance but by reﬂection for short distance. The only diﬀerence is that we are working on
a non-ﬂat Riemannian manifold for which the curvature term appears in calculations. Since
Itˆo’s formula of the distance process has been well developed for couplings by both parallel
displacement and reﬂection, the proof is also straightforward.

The proofs of the other two assertions are based on the log-Sobolev inequality and the

log-Harnack inequality derived in [23] and [36] respectively for bounded below RicZ.
Proof of Theorem 2.1. (a) For two diﬀerent points x, y ∈ M, let Px,y : TxM → TyM be the
parallel displacement along the minimal geodesic γ : [0, ρ(x, y)] → M from x to y, and let
Mx,y := Px,y − 2h·, ˙γ0i ˙γρ(x,y) : TxM → TyM be the mirror reﬂection. Both maps are smooth
in (x, y) outside the cut-locus Cut(M). According to [14] and [29], the appearance of the
cut-locus and/or a convex boundary helps for the success of coupling, i.e.
it makes the
distance between two marginal processes smaller. So, for simplicity, we may and do assume
that both the cut-locus and the boundary are empty, see [2, Section 3] or [33, Chapter 2] for
details.

Now, let Xt solve the SDE

dIXt = √2utdBt + Z(Xt)dt, X0 = x,

where dI denotes the Itˆo diﬀerential introduced in [12] on Riemannian manifolds, Bt is the
d-dimensional Brownian motion, and ut is the horizontal lift of Xt to the frame bundle O(M).
Then Xt is a diﬀusion process generated by L. To construct the coupling by reﬂection for
short distance and parallel displacement for long distance, we introduce a cut-oﬀ function
h ∈ C 1([0,∞)) which is decreasing such that h(r) = 1 for r ≤ r0, h(r) = 0 for r ≥
r0 + 1, and √1 − h2 is also in C 1, see e.g. [40, (3.1)] for a concrete example. To construct
the coupling in the above spirit, we split the noise into two parts, i.e. to replace dBt by
h(ρ(Xt, Yt))dB′t + p1 − h(ρ(Xt, Yt))2dB′′t
for two independent Brownian motions B′t and
B′′t , then make reﬂection for the B′′t part and parallel displacement for the B′t part. More
precisely, let (Xt, Yt) solve the following SDE on M × M for (X0, Y0) = (x, y):
dIXt = √2(cid:16)h(ρ(Xt, Yt))utdB′t +p1 − h(ρ(Xt, Yt))2utdB′′t(cid:17) + Z(Xt)dt,
dIYt = √2(cid:16)h(ρ(Xt, Yt))MXt,YtutdB′t +p1 − h(ρ(Xt, Yt))2PXt,YtutdB′′t(cid:17) + Z(Yt)dt.

Since the coeﬃcients of the SDE are at least C 1 outside the diagonal {(z, z) : z ∈ M}, it has
a unique solution up to the coupling time

T := inf{t ≥ 0 : Xt = Yt}.

We then let Xt = Yt for t ≥ T as usual. By the second variational formula and the index
lemma (see e.g. the proof of [34, Lemma 2.3] and [29, (2.4)]), the process ρt := ρ(Xt, Yt)
satisﬁes

dρt ≤ 2√2h(ρt)dbt + IZ(Xt, Yt)dt,

t ≤ T

17

for some one-dimensional Brownian motion bt. Thus, by condition (1.8),

(4.1)

dρt ≤ 2√2h(ρt)dbt +(cid:8)(K1 + K2)1{ρt≤r0} − K2(cid:9)ρtdt,

t ≤ T.
Since h(ρt) = 0 for ρt ≥ r0 + 1 while dρt < 0 when ρt ≥ r0 + 1, this implies
(4.2)

ρt ≤ (r0 + 1) ∨ ρ0 ≤ 1 + r0 + ρ(x, y).

On the other hand, since h(ρt) = 1 for ρt ≤ r0, as observed in [17] we have
(4.3)

Eρt ≤ ce−λtρ(x, y),

t ≥ 0

for some constants c, λ > 0. Indeed, let

ε = 1 ∧

1

2(K1 + K2)r0er0

,

¯ρt = ερt + 1 − e−ρt.

By (4.1) and Itˆo’s formula, we have

d¯ρt ≤ 2√2(ε + e−ρt)h(ρt)dbt

+ (ε + e−ρt)nε(K1 + K2)1{ρt≤r0} − εK2 −

≤ 2√2(ε + e−ρt)dbt − c1 ¯ρtdt,

t ≤ T

4

ρteρt(ε + e−ρt)

1{ρt≤r0}oρtdt

for some constants c1, λ > 0. This implies E¯ρt ≤ ¯ρ0e−c1t. Noting that ερt ≤ ¯ρt ≤ (1 + ε)ρt,
we prove (4.3) for some constants c, λ > 0. Combining (4.2) with (4.3) we arrive at

EΦ(ρt/r) ≤

sup

s∈(0,1+r0+ρ0]

Φ(s/r)

s

Eρt ≤ ce−λtρ(x, y)

sup

s∈(0,1+r0+ρ0]

Φ(s/r)

s

.

So,

WΦ(δxPt, δyPt) ≤ kρtkLΦ(P) = inf (cid:8)r > 0 : EΦ(ρt/r) ≤ 1(cid:9)
≤ infnr > 0 :

cρ(x, y)o,

Φ( s

s ≤

sup

eλt

s∈(0,1+ρ(x,y)]

which proves (2.1). Therefore, the proof of (1) is ﬁnished since the second inequality therein
is a simple consequence of (2.1).

(b) According to the proofs of [34, Proposition 3.1 and Theorem 1.1], our conditions
imply that Pt is hyperbounded; that is, kPtk2→4 < ∞ holds for some t > 0. Since (1.8)
implies RicZ ≥ −(K1 + K2), by the hyperboundedness and [23, Theorem 2.1], we have the
defective log-Sobolev inequality

µ(f 2 log f 2) ≤ C1µ(|∇f|2) + C2, f ∈ C 1

b (M), µ(f 2) = 1

for some constants C1, C2 > 0. Since the symmetric Dirichlet form E (f, g) := µ(h∇f,∇gi)
with domain H 1,2(µ) is irreducible, according to [38] (see also [18]), the log-Sobolev inequality
(3.3) holds for some constant C > 0, so that (2) is proved.

18

(c) According to [25, Theorem 1.10] (see [4, 32, 20] for the case without boundary), the

log-Sobolev inequality implies the Talagrand inequality

(4.4)

W2(f µ, µ)2 ≤

C
2

µ(f log f ), f ≥ 0, µ(f ) = 1.

Next, let P ∗t be the adjoint of Pt in L2(µ). By Proposition 3.3 for P ∗t
log-Sobolev inequality implies

in place of Pt, the

(4.5)

µ((P ∗t f ) log P ∗t f ) ≤ e−4t/Cµ(f log f ),

t ≥ 0, f ≥ 0, µ(f ) = 1.

Moreover, according to [36, Theorem 1.1], the curvature condition RicZ ≥ −(K1+K2) =: −K
is equivalent to the log-Harnack inequality

Pt(log f )(x) ≤ log Ptf (y) +

Kρ(x, y)2
2(1 − e−2Kt)

,

By [39, Proposition 1.4.4(3)], this implies

t ≥ 0, x, y ∈ M, 0 ≤ f ∈ Bb(M).

(4.6)

t ≥ 0, f ≥ 0, µ(f ) = 1

for some constant c1 > 0. Noting that RicZ ≥ −K implies |∇Ptf| ≤ eKtPt|∇f| (see e.g.
[36]), by Proposition 3.1 we have

W2((f µ)Pt, µ) = W2((f µ)Pt, µPt) ≤ c2W2(f µ, µ),

t ∈ [0, 1], f ≥ 0, µ(f ) = 1.

Combining with (4.7) yields

W2((f µ)Pt, µ) ≤ ce−λtW2(f µ, µ),

t ≥ 0, f ≥ 0, µ(f ) = 1

for some constants c, λ > 0. Therefore, the proof of (3) is ﬁnished.

5 Proof of Theorem 2.3 and Corollary 2.4

Proof of Theorem 2.3. (1) Since RicZ ≥ −K for some constant K ≥ 0, we have (see e.g.
[36])

|∇Ptf| ≤ eKtPt|∇f|, f ∈ C 1

b (M).

19

Combining this with Proposition 3.4 for q = 1 and noting that Pt|∇f| is continuous, we
obtain

for some constants c0, λ, t0 > 0. Obviously,

|∇Ptf| ≤ c0e−λtPt|∇f|,

t ≥ t0, f ∈ C 1

b (M)

k · kL1(ν) ≤ Φ−1(1)k · kLΦ

∗ (ν), ν ∈ P(M), Φ ∈ ¯N .

Then

|∇Ptf| ≤ c0Φ−1(1)e−λtk∇fkLΦ

∗ (Pt),

According to Proposition 3.1, this is equivalent to

t ≥ 0, Φ ∈ ¯N , f ∈ C 1

b (M).

(5.1)

WΦ(δxPt, δyPt) ≤ c0Φ−1(1)e−λtρ(x, y),

t ≥ 0, x, y ∈ M.

On the other hand, noting that

C (δxPt, δyPt) ∋ πt := (δxPt) × (δyPt) ≤ kPtk2

L1(µ)→L∞(µ)(µ × µ),

we obtain

Combining this with (5.1) and the semigroup property, we arrive at

WΦ(δxPt, δyPt) ≤ kρkLΦ(πt) ≤ GΦ(2t),

t > 0.

WΦ∗(δxPt, δyPt) ≤ c0Φ−1(1)e−λt/2WΦ(δxPt/2, δyPt/2) ≤ c0Φ−1(1)e−λt/2GΦ(t).

This together with (5.1) implies (2.6) for some constants c, λ > 0. Moreover, (2.7) follows
from (2.6) according to Proposition 3.1.
(2) By Proposition 3.1, (2.8) implies

|∇Ptf| ≤ ce−λtPt|∇f|,

t ≥ 0, f ∈ C 1

b (M).

Then using the standard semigroup calculation of Bakry-Emery, this implies

Since limt→∞ Ptg = µ(g) for g ∈ Bb(M) due to the ergodicity, by letting t → ∞ we prove
the log-Sobolev inequality for (3.3) for C = 2c2

Proof of Corollary 2.4. We ﬁrst observe that the proof of [34, Theorem 4.2] works also for
the non-symmetric case with ∇Z in place of HessV , so that

Since in the symmetric case we have kPtkL1(µ)→L∞(µ) ≤ kPt/2k2
follows immediately from Theorem 2.3.
As for the non-symmetric case, since

L2(µ)→L∞(µ), the ﬁrst assertion

kPtkL1(µ)→L∞(µ) ≤ kPt/2kL1(µ)→L2(µ)kPt/2kL2(µ)→L∞(µ),

by Theorem 2.3 and (5.2) it suﬃces to prove

(5.3)

kPtkL1(µ)→L2(µ) ≤ c′ + c′H(c′t−1),

t > 0

for some constant c′ > 0. According to [23, Theorem 2.1], (5.2) implies the super log-Sobolev

6 Proofs of Theorems 2.5-2.6 and Proposition 2.7

Proof of Theorems 2.5. Let Xt(x) solve (2.15) with initial point x. By Itˆo’s formula and
condition (2.16) we obtain

d|Xt(x) − Xt(y)|p

HS + 2hZ(Xt(x) − Z(Xt(y)), Xt(x) − Xt(y)iodt

for some martingale Mt. This implies

E|Xt(x) − Xt(y)|p ≤ e−pKpt|x − y|p,

t ≥ 0, x, y ∈ Rd,

and thus,

|∇Ptf (x)| ≤ lim sup

Then the desired assertion follows from Proposition 3.1.

Proof of Theorem 2.6. (1) We reformulate (2.15) as

(6.2)

dXt = Z(Xt)dt + σ0(Xt)dB′t + λ0dB′′t ,

where B′t and B′′t are independent d-dimensional Brownian motions. For any x 6= y, let Xt
solve this SDE with X0 = x, and let Yt solve the following coupled SDE with Y0 = y:

dYt = Z(Yt)dt + σ0(Yt)dB′t + λ0(cid:18)dB′′t − 2hXt − Yt, dB′′t i(Xt − Yt)

|Xt − Yt|2

(cid:19).

That is, under the ﬂat metric we have made coupling by reﬂection for B′′t and coupling by
parallel displacement for B′t. Obviously, the coupled SDE has a unique solution up to the
coupling time

Tx,y := inf{t ≥ 0 : Xt = Yt}.

We set Yt = Xt for t ≥ Tx,y as usual. Then by (2.17) and Itˆo’s formula, we obtain
t ≤ Tx,y
(6.3)

d|Xt − Yt| ≤ dMt +(cid:8)(K1 + K2)1{|Xt−Yt|≤r0} − K2(cid:9)|Xt − Yt|dt,

for

dMt :=

2λ0hXt − Yt, dB′′t i

|Xt − Yt|

+ h(σ0(Xt) − σ0(Yt))dB′t, Xt − Yti

|Xt − Yt|

being a martingale with

(6.4)

dhMit ≥ 4λ2

0dt.

By repeating the argument leading to (4.3), it is easy see that (6.3) and (6.4) imply

for some constants c, λ > 0 independent of x, y. Therefore,

E|Xt − Yt| ≤ ce−λt|x − y|,

t ≥ 0

|∇Ptf| ≤ ce−λtk∇fk∞,

t ≥ 0, f ∈ C 1

b (Rd),

so that the ﬁrst assertion follows from Proposition 3.1.

(2) According to [37, Theorem 1.1], a ≥ αI and (2.19) imply the log-Harnack inequality

Pt(log f )(x) ≤ log Ptf (y) +

t ≥ 0, x, y ∈ Rd, 0 ≤ f ∈ Bb(Rd)

c1|x − y|2
1 − e−c2t ,

for some constants c1, c2 > 0. Combining this with the log-Sobolev inequality, we prove the
second assertion as in (c) in the proof of Theorem 2.1.

(3) According to the proof of Theorem 2.5, the condition (2.16) implies the gradient

estimate (6.1). Next, by Proposition 3.4, the ultracontractivity and (6.1) imply

|∇Ptf| ≤ c(p)e−λt(Pt|∇f|

Proof of Proposition 2.7. We will apply results in [23] and [35]. To this end, we ﬁrst verify

Moreover, (2.23) implies that Pt has a unique invariant probability measure µ such that
µ(ec2|·|2) < ∞ for some c2 > K
2α . Since a ≥ αI for some α > 0 and a is bounded, the
Riemannian distance ρa induced by the metric hu, via := ha−1u, vi is equivalent to the
Euclidian metric:

(6.5)

So, µ(eλρa(0,·)2) < ∞ holds for some λ > K
log-Sobolev inequality (2.18) for some constant C > 0.

2 . Therefore, according to [35, Theorem 1.3], the

Next, due to (6.5), we may repeat the proof of [23, Corollary 2.5] with γ(r) = c2rδ and

ρ = | · | to prove
(6.6)
for some constant c3 > 0. Combing this with the curvature condition that Γ2 ≥ K′Γ for
some constant K′, we obtain from [23, Theorem 2.1] for p = 2 and q = ∞ that
