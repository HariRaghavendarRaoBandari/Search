Birational models of moduli spaces of coherent

sheaves on the projective plane

Chunyi Li and Xiaolei Zhao

March 17, 2016

Abstract

In this paper, we study the birational geometry of moduli spaces of semistable
sheaves on the projective plane via Bridgeland stability conditions. We show that the
entire MMP of their moduli spaces can be run via wall-crossing. Via a description
of the walls, we give a numerical description of their movable cones, along with
its chamber decomposition corresponding to minimal models. As an application, we
show that for primitive vectors, all birational models corresponding to open chambers
in the movable cone are smooth and irreducible.

Introduction

Birational geometry of moduli space of sheaves on surfaces has been studied a lot in recent
years, see [ABCH, BM2, BM3, BMW, CH1, CH2, CH3, CHW, LZ, Wo]. The milestone
work in [BM2, BM3] completes the whole picture for K3 surfaces. In this paper, we give
a complete description for the minimal model program of the moduli space of semistable
sheaves on the projective plane via wall-crossings in the space of Bridgeland stability
conditions. In particular, we deduce a description of their nef cone, movable cone and the
chamber decomposition for their minimal models.

Geometric stability conditions on P2: The notion of stability condition on a C-linear
triangulated category was ﬁrst introduced in [Br1] by Bridgeland. A stability condition
consists of a slicing P of semistable objects in the triangulated category and a central
charge Z on the Grothendieck group, which is compatible with the slicing. In particular
in this paper, we consider the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on the pro-
jective plane. A stability condition σ = (Z,P) is called geometric if it satisﬁes the support
property and all sky scraper sheaves are σ-stable with the same phase, see Deﬁnition 1.9.
The Grothendieck group K(P2) of Db(P2) is of rank 3 and KR(P2)(= K(P2) ⊗ R) is
spanned by the Chern characters ch0, ch1 and ch2. Due to the work of Drezet and Le Potier,
there is a Le Potier cone (see the picture below Deﬁnition 1.6) in the space KR(P2), such
that there exists slope stable coherent sheaves with character w = (ch0(> 0), ch1, ch2) ∈
K(P2) if and only if either w is the character of an exceptional bundle, or it is not inside
the Le Potier cone. By taking the kernel of the central charge, the space of all geometric

1

stability conditions can be realized as a principal (cid:93)GL+(2, R)-bundle over GeoLP, which is
an open region above the Le Potier curve, see Proposition 1.13. Note that the (cid:93)GL+(2, R)-
action does not aﬀect the stability of objects. We will write a geometric stability condition
as σs,q with (s, q) ∈ GeoLP indicating the kernel of its central charge. Let Ms(ss)
σs,q (w) be the
moduli space of σs,q-(semi)stable objects in the heart Coh#s of the stability condition σs,q
with character w ∈ K(P2), we address the following questions:

1. For a Chern character w and a geometric stability condition σs,q, when Mss

σs,q(w) is

non-empty?

2. How does Mss

σs,q(w) change when σs,q varies in GeoLP?

The ﬁrst question is answered step by step in several parts of the paper. Similar to the
result of Drezet and Le Potier, when the character w is inside the Le Potier cone and not
exceptional (see Corollary 1.19), there is no σs,q-semistable object with character w (or
−w) for any geometric stability condition σs,q. In other words, Mss
σs,q(w) is always empty.
When the character w is proportional to an exceptional character (see Corollary 1.30),
σs,q(−w) are empty if and only if: the point (1, s, q) and the reduced
both Mss
character ˜w are on diﬀerent sides of the vertical line Le± for some exceptional character e,
and (1, s, q) is below the line Lwe in the GeoLP.

σs,q(w) and Mss

The main case of the ﬁrst question is when the character is not inside the Le Potier

cone.
Theorem 0.1 (Lemma 3.12, Theorem 3.14). Let w ∈ K(P2) be a character not inside the
Le Potier cone, then Mss
in
the GeoLP.

σs,q(w) is empty if and only if σs,q is not above Llast

w or Lright-last

w

w and Lright-last

w

The notations Llast

are deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.11. As we will see, the de-
scription for the last wall is equivalent to that for the eﬀective boundary of the moduli
space. This is ﬁrst solved in [CHW] for the ch0 ≥ 1 case and in [Wo] for the torsion case
by studying the eﬀective cone of the moduli space. In this paper, we reprove these results
in our set-up in a diﬀerent way.

For the second question, we have the following result:

Theorem 0.2 (Theorem 2.19, Theorem 2.24). Let w be a primitive character. The moduli
space Ms
σs,q(w) is smooth and connected for any generic geometric stability condition σs,q
when it is non-empty. Any two non-empty moduli spaces Ms
σ(cid:48)(w) are birational
to each other. The actual walls (chambers) is one-to-one corresponding to the stable base
locus decomposition walls (chambers) of the divisor cone of Ms
GM(w). In particular, one
can run the whole minimal model program for Ms
GM(w) via wall crossing in the space of
geometric stability conditions.

σ(w) and Ms

The smoothness result can be proved easily for moduli of slope stable sheaves. How-
ever, for Bridgeland stable objects, they may not remain stable after twisting by O(−3).
The key point is to develop a method to compare slopes with respect to diﬀerent Bridge-
land stability conditions, and conclude the vanishing of Hom group. This is achieved ﬁrst
in [LZ], and generalized to the current situation in Section 2. The following consequence
seems new to the theory of MMP of moduli of sheaves.

2

Corollary 0.3. Let w ∈ K(P2) be a primitive character not inside the Le Potier cone, then
each minimal model of Ms
GM(w) corresponding to an open chamber in the movable cone
is smooth.

The moduli space Ms

σs,q(w) can be constructed via the geometric invariant theory, be-
cause there are the so-called algebraic stability conditions. The space StabAlg of algebraic
stability conditions is large enough in the sense that for any Chern character w outside the
Le Potier cone and stability condition σs,q in GeoLP, the line segment lσw always intersects
σ(cid:48)(w) does not depend on the choice of σ(cid:48) on lσw, we may
StabAlg. The moduli space Ms
assume that σs,q is an algebraic stability condition. After a suitable homological shift, the
heart of an algebraic stability condition is the same as the representation space of a path
algebra with relations. The moduli space of such kind of quiver representations can be
constructed via the geometric invariant theory. As an immediate corollary, the GIT con-
struction ensures that Mss
σs,q(w) is projective. This construction ﬁrst appears in [ABCH]
for Hilbert schemes of point on P2, and in [BMW] for moduli of sheaves, both using
quivers associated to line bundles. In this paper, we further study the relationship between
geometric stability and algebraic stability, and make available this construction for any
full strong exceptional collections of P2. This generalization will be important for some
arguments in this paper.

σs0,q0

When q0 (cid:29) 0 and s0 < ch1(w), Ms

(w) is the same as the moduli space Ms

GM(w) of
slope stable sheaves. For any Chern character v right orthogonal to w (i.e. χ(w, v) = 0),
the Donaldson morphism provides a divisor class Lv in PicR(Ms
GM(w)). On the other hand,
σs,q(w), the GIT construction provides a divisor class [Ls,q] in
for each moduli space Ms
PicR(Ms
σs,q(w)) up to a positive scalar. When the exceptional locus of the natural map
(w) (cid:39) Ms
σs,q(w) (cid:100) Ms
Ms
GM(w) (which is constructed via the variation of GIT con-
cretely, see Section 2) has codimension greater than 1, the divisor class [Ls,q] is also
GM(w)). Suppose the line Lwσs,q is given by ⊥vs,q for some vs,q ∈ w⊥,
deﬁned on PicR(Ms
then the divisor class [Ls,q] from the GIT construction is the same as [Lvs,q] given by the
Donaldson morphism up to a positive scalar.

σs0,q0

Based on the explicit correspondence between walls in the space of stability conditions
and walls in the divisor cone, we may describe all stable base locus walls (including the
boundaries of nef cone, eﬀective cone and movable cone) as actual walls in the space of
stability conditions. Here an actual wall for a Chern character w is a potential wall Lσw
such that curves are contracted from either side of Mss
σ (w). So it becomes an
important question to ask when a potential wall is an actual wall. In Section 3, we give a
numerical criteria on actual walls, which depends on only numerical data, and provides
an eﬀective algorithm to compute all actual walls for w.
Theorem 0.4 (Theorem 3.16). Let w ∈ K(P2) be a Chern character with ch0(w) ≥ 0 not
inside the Le Potier cone. For any stability condition σ inside ¯∆<0 ⊂ GeoLP between the
last wall Llast
w and the vertical wall Lw±, the wall Lσw is an actual wall for w if and only
if there exists a Chern character v ∈ K(P2) on the line segment lσw such that: ch0(v) > 0,
ch0(v), the characters v and w− v are either exceptional or not inside the Le Potier
ch0(w) > ch1(v)
ch1(w)
cone, and both of them are not in TRwE for any exceptional bundle E.

σ±(w) (cid:100) Mss

3

TRwE is deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.15. It is a small triangle area decided by w and an
exceptional character E. On an actual wall Lwσ, the Chern character w can always be
written as the sum of two proper Chern characters w(cid:48) and w−w(cid:48) satisfying the conditions in
the theorem. The key is to prove the inverse direction: when such two characters exist, two
stable objects with the corresponding characters extend to a stable object with character
w, which is destabilized on the wall. Roughly speaking, three main steps are involved: 1.
σ(w − w(cid:48)) are non-empty; 2. the extension group ext1 between two generic
σ(w(cid:48)) and Ms
Ms
σ(w − w(cid:48)) is non-zero; 3. the extension of two stable objects will
σ(w(cid:48)) and Ms
objects in Ms
produce σ+ or σ− stable object with character w.
The conditions in the theorem are mainly used in step 1, and step 3 follows from
general computations. For step 2, based on the characters, we can only aim to show χ(w−
w(cid:48), w(cid:48)) < 0. However, one may wonder about the case that on an actual wall, generic
σ(w− w(cid:48)) do not have non-trivial extensions, but objects on some
objects in Ms
jumping loci extend to σ±-stable objects. Should this happen, χ(w−w(cid:48), w(cid:48)) ≥ 0 but objects
σ(w − w(cid:48)) still extend to σ±-stable objects. From this point of view, it is
in Ms
a bit surprising to have a numerical criteria for actual walls. The main point in Theorem
0.4 is to rule out this possibility, and this is done by gaining a good understanding of the
last wall.

σ(w(cid:48)) and Ms

σ(w(cid:48)) and Ms

Moreover, the criteria decides all the actual walls eﬀectively, in the sense that it in-
volves only ﬁnitely many steps of decisions, and one may write a computer program to
output all the actual walls with a given Chern character w as the input. We compute the
example for w = (4, 0,−15) by hands to show some details of this computation. A cartoon
for the actual walls in this case is as follows.

As two quick applications of Theorem 0.4, we decide the boundary (on the primitive
GM(w) for a primitive character w =

side) of the nef cone and the movable cone of Ms
(ch0, ch1, ch2). The other side is dually decided by w(cid:48) = (ch0,−ch1, ch2).
Theorem 0.5 (Theorem 4.3, the movable cone). Let w be a primitive Chern character
with ch0(w) ≥ 0 not inside the Le Potier cone. When χ(E, w) (cid:44) 0 for any exceptional
bundle E with ch1(E)
ch0(w), the movable cone boundary on the primitive side coincides
with the eﬀective cone boundary.

ch0(E) < ch1(w)

When χ(Eγ, w) = 0 for an exceptional bundle Eγ with ch1(Eγ)

ch0(w), let Eα, Eβ, Eγ
be exceptional bundles corresponding to dyadic numbers p−1
2n respectively, then
w can be uniquely written as n2eα − n1eβ−3 for some positive integers n1, n2. Deﬁne the
character P accordingly as follows:

ch0(Eγ) < ch1(w)
2n , p+1

2n , p

1. P := eγ − (3ch0(Eβ) − n2)eα, if 1 ≤ n2 < 3ch0(Eβ);
2. P := eγ, if n2 ≥ 3ch0(Eβ).

Then the wall LPw corresponds to the boundary of the movable cone of Ms

GM(w).

Theorem 0.6 (Theorem 4.6, the nef cone). Let w be a primitive Chern character with
ch0(w) > 0 and ¯∆(w) ≥ 10, then the ﬁrst actual wall to the left of vertical wall (i.e. nef
cone boundary for Ms

GM(w)) is the ﬁrst lower rank wall Lvw such that

1. ch1(v)

ch0(v) is the greatest rational number less than ch1(w)

ch0(w) with 0 < ch0(v) ≤ ch0(w);

2. given the ﬁrst condition, if ch1(v) is even (odd resp.), let ch2(v) be the greatest
integer (2ch2(v) be the greatest odd integer resp.), such that the point v is either an
exceptional character or not inside ConeLP.

The result on the nef cone is not hard to see from the {1, ch1

}-plane picture. First
of all, when the Chern character w has certain distance from GeoLP, the ﬁrst wall is not of
}-plane, although the Le Potier curve for the stable objects
higher rank. On the {1, ch1
is zigzag, when the Chern character w is not very close to GeoLP, the ﬁrst wall Lwv is still
given by a point v with ch1
ch0

-coordinate closest to the vertical wall.

The result on the movable cone is more subtle. When the Chern character w is right

orthogonal to an exceptional bundle Eγ, the jumping locus

{[F] ∈ Ms

GM(w)| Hom(Eγ, F) (cid:44) 0}

has codimension 1 and is the exceptional divisor that contracted on the movable cone
boundary. However, the wall Lweγ for Hom(Eγ, F) (cid:44) 0 may not always be the wall for this
contraction. In the case when n2 < 3ch0(Eβ), the exceptional divisor is already contracted
at a wall prior to the wall Lweγ. One simple example of such w is when (ch0, ch1, ch2) =
(1, 0,−4), in other words, the ideal sheaf of four points. The Chern character w is right
orthogonal to the cotangent bundle Ω, whose dyadic number is − 3
2. The other excep-
tional bundles Eα and Eβ are O(−2) and O(−1) respectively, and w can be written as
2[O(−2)] − [O(−4)]. The jumping locus of Hom(Ω, w) (cid:44) 0 is the exceptional divisor, and

5

it is the same as the jumping locus Hom(I1(−1), w) (cid:44) 0, where I1(−1) stands for the
ideal sheaf of one point tensor O(−1). Since the wall LI1(−1)w is between LΩw and Lw± in
}-plane, the boundary of movable cone should be given by LI1(−1)w. Geomet-
the {1, ch1
rically, the exceptional locus is where any three points are collinear.

Related Work. There are several papers [ABCH, BMW, CH1, CH2, CH3, CHW, LZ,
Wo] studying the birational geometry of moduli of sheaves on the projective plane via
wall crossing.

The study for Hilbert schemes of points on P2 ﬁrst appears in [ABCH], and the wall
crossing behavior is explicitly carried out for small numbers of points. It is also ﬁrstly
suggested in [ABCH] that there is a correspondence between the wall crossing picture in
the Bridgeland space and the minimal model program of the moduli space. In [CH1], the
correspondence between walls in the Bridgeland space and stable locus decomposition
walls in MMP is established for monomial schemes in the plane. In [LZ], we proved the
full correspondence for Hilbert schemes of points, by establishing similar results as in
Section 2 of this paper, and further generalize this correspondence to deformations of
Hilbert schemes, or Hilbert schemes of non-commutative projective planes.

For moduli of torsion sheaves, the eﬀective cone and the nef cone are computed in
[Wo]. For general moduli of sheaves on P2, the theory is built up in [BMW]. Among
other results, the projectivity of moduli of Bridgeland stable objects is proved in [BMW].
The eﬀective cone and the ample cone are computed in [CH2, CHW] respectively. Also
[CHW] gives the criteria on when the movable cone coincides with the eﬀective cone. We
refer to the beautiful lecture notes [CH3] for details of these results.

Compared with these papers, the smoothness and irreducibility of moduli of Bridge-
land stable objects with primitive characters are only proved in this paper, which enables
us to deduce the equivalence between wall crossing and MMP for moduli of sheaves on
P2 suggested in [ABCH]. Our result on the eﬀective cone is essentially equivalent to that
in [CHW], however, the proof is very diﬀerent. Since this proof is very closely related
to the proof of the criteria on actual walls, we decide to include it here. The numerical
criteria on actual walls and the result on the movable cone are new. Our result on the nef
cone (Theorem 0.6) follows from our numerical criteria. The nef cone was ﬁrst proved in
[CH2] when ∆ is large enough with respect to ch0 and ch1
(see Remark 8.7 in [CH2] for
ch0
a lower bound), the bound in Theorem 0.6 is explicitly given by ¯∆ ≥ 10. Moreover, as
a beneﬁt of our set-up, in a large part of the paper we can treat the torsion case and the
positive rank case uniformly. We make careful remarks on this through the paper.

Another important application of the wall-crossing machinery is towards the Le Potier

strange duality conjecture. A special case is studied in [Ta].

Organization. In Section 1.1, we review some classical work by Drezet and Le Potier
for stable sheaves on the projective plane. We prove some useful lemmas by visualizing
}-plane in Section 1.3. These proper-
the geometric stability conditions in the {1, ch1
ties will play crucial roles for the arguments in the paper. In Section 2, we prove that the
moduli space Ms
σ(w) is smooth and irreducible for generic σ and primitive w. In this way,

1 Stability conditions on Db(P2)
In this section, we will recall some properties of the bounded derived category of coher-
ent sheaves on the projective plane, and the construction of stability conditions on it. In
Section 1.1, we will explain the structure of Db(P2) given by exceptional triples, and the
numerical criteria on the existence of stable sheaves. A slice of the space of geometric
stability conditions is discussed in Section 1.2, and the wall-chamber structure on it is
studied in Section 1.3. In Section 1.4, we study the algebraic stability conditions, i.e. the
stability conditions given by the exceptional triples. We also explain how they are glued
to the slice of geometric stability conditions. In Section 1.5, we explain in detail the dif-
ference and advantage of our set-up over the one used in other papers. Finally in Section
1.6, we derive some easy numerical conditions on the existence of stable objects.

1.1 Review and notations: Exceptional objects, triples and the Le

Potier curve

Let T be a C-linear triangulated category of ﬁnite type. In this article, T will always be
Db(P2): the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on the projective plane over C.
We ﬁrst recall the following deﬁnitions from [AKO, GR, Or].
Deﬁnition 1.1. An object E in T is called exceptional if

Hom(E, E[i]) = 0, for i (cid:44) 0; Hom(E, E) = C.

An ordered collection of exceptional objects E = {E0, . . . , Em} is called an exceptional
collection if

Hom(Ei, E j[k]) = 0, for i > j, any k.

Deﬁnition 1.2. Let E = {E0, . . . , En} be an exceptional collection. We say this collection
E is is strong, if

for all i, j and q (cid:44) 0. This collection E is called full, if E generates T under homological
shifts, cones and direct sums.

Hom(Ei, E j[q]) = 0,

1.1 Review and notations: Exceptional objects, triples and the Le Potier curve

An exceptional coherent sheaf on P2 is locally free since it is rigid. We summarize
some results on the classiﬁcation of exceptional bundles on P2 and introduce some nota-
tions, for details we refer to [DP, GR, LeP].
The Picard group of P2 is of rank one with generator H = [O(1)], and we will, by
abuse of notation, identify the i-th Chern character chi with its degree H2−ichi. There is
a one-to-one correspondence between exceptional bundles and dyadic integers, p
2m , with
integer p and non-negative integer m. Denote the exceptional bundle corresponding to p
2m
by E( p

2m ). We write Chern characters of E( p

is greatly related to the existence of semistable sheaves.

For the rest of this section, we recall the construction of the Le Potier curve CLP, which
The Grothendieck group K(P2) has rank 3. We denote K(P2) ⊗ R by KR(P2). Consider

the real projective space P(cid:0)KR(P2)(cid:1) with homogeneous coordinate [ch0, ch1, ch2], we view

the locus ch0 = 0 as the line at inﬁnity. The complement forms an aﬃne real plane, which
is referred to as the {1, ch1
}-plane.
For any object F in Db(P2), we write

Given the Le Potier curve, we can now state the numerical condition on the existence

of stable sheaves.

Theorem 1.8 (Drezet, Le Potier). There exists a slope semistable coherent sheaf with
character w = (ch0(> 0), ch1, ch2) ∈ K(P2) if and only if one of the following two condi-
tions holds:

1. w is proportional to an exceptional character;

1.2 Geometric stability conditions
In this section, we follow [BM1, Br2] and recall that the space of geometric stability con-
ditions on P2 is a (cid:93)GL+(2, R) principal bundle over a subspace GeoLP of the {1, ch1
}-plane.
In applications to geometry, the following type of stability conditions are always most

relevant.

Deﬁnition 1.9. A stability condition σ on Db(P2) is called geometric if it satisﬁes the
support property and all skyscraper sheaves k(x) are σ-stable of the same phase. We
denote the set of all geometric stability conditions by StabGeo(P2).

In order to construct geometric stability conditions, we want to ﬁrst introduce the
appropriate t-structure. Fix a real number s, a torsion pair of coherent sheaves on P2 is
given by:

Coh≤s: subcategory of Coh(P2) generated by semistable sheaves of slope ≤ s.

Proposition and Deﬁnition 1.10. For a point (1, s, q) ∈ GeoLP, there exists a geometric
stability condition σs,q := (Zs,q, Coh#s) on Db(P2), where the central charge is given by

Zs,q(E) := (−ch2(E) + q · ch0(E)) + i(ch1(E) − s · ch0(E)).

In this case, Ker(Zs,q) consists of the characters corresponding to the point (1, s, q). We
write φσs,q or φs,q for the phase function of σs,q.

For the proof that σs,q is indeed a geometric stability condition, we refer to [BM1]
Corollary 4.6 and [Br2], which also work well for P2. Here the phase function φs,q can be
also deﬁned for objects in Coh#s:

φs,q(E) :=

It is well-deﬁned in the sense that it coincides with the phase function on σs,q-semistable
objects.
Remark 1.11. The deﬁnition of σs,q here is diﬀerent from the usual one as that in [ABCH],
which is given as (Z(cid:48)
2 , Zs,q
has the same kernel as that of Z(cid:48)
. Their formula are slightly diﬀerent. The imaginary
parts are the same, but the real parts diﬀer by a multiple of the imaginary part. We would
like to use the version here because q − s2
2 is allowed to be negative, and the kernel of the
central charge on the {1, ch1
Remark 1.12. Given a point P = (1, s, q) in GeoLP, we will also write σP, φP, CohP(P2)
and ZP for the stability condition σs,q, the phase function φs,q, the tilt heart Coh#s(P2) and
the central charge Zs,q respectively.

Up to the (cid:93)GL+(2, R)-action, geometric stability conditions are all of the form given in

Proposition and Deﬁnition 1.10.
Proposition 1.13 ([Br2] Proposition 10.3, [BM1] Section 3). Let σ = (Z,P((0, 1])) be a
geometric stability condition such that all skyscraper sheaves k(x) are contained in P(1).
Then the heart P((0, 1]) is Coh#s for some real number s. The central charge Z can be
written in the form of

−ch2 + a · ch1 + b · ch0,

where a, b ∈ C satisfy the following conditions:

• (cid:61)a > 0, (cid:61)b(cid:61)a

= s;

• (1,

(cid:61)b(cid:61)a, (cid:60)a(cid:61)b(cid:61)a

+(cid:60)b) is in GeoLP.

Thanks to the classiﬁcation of characters of semistable sheaves on P2 [DP], this prop-
erty is proved in the same way as in cases of local P2 [BM1] and K3 surfaces [Br1]. Since
all discussions in this paper are invariant under the (cid:93)GL+(2, R)-action, geometric stabil-
ity conditions will be identiﬁed with the corresponding points in GeoLP. We will always
visualize StabGeo(P2) as GeoLP in this paper.

1.3 Potential walls and phases
We collect some well-known and useful results about the potential walls in this section.
Since our set-up is slightly diﬀerent from the usual one (see Remark 1.11), we give state-
ments and proofs for completeness. We hope this can also illustrate the advantage of our
set-up.

Deﬁnition 1.14. A stability condition is said to be non-degenerate, if it satisﬁes the sup-
port property and the image of its central charge is not contained in any real line in C.
We write Stabnd for the space of non-degenerate stability conditions.

The kernel map for the central charges is well-deﬁned on Stabnd:

Proof. By [Br1], Stabnd → HomZ(K(P2), C) is a local homeomorphism, whose image
lies in the subspace of non-degenerate morphisms in HomZ(K(P2), C). When taking the
Z (K(P2), C)/GL+(2, R) can be identiﬁed with the quotient

We have the following description of the potential wall, i.e. the locus of stability con-

ditions for which two given characters are of the same slope.

Lemma 1.16 (Potential walls). Let P = (1, s, q) be a point in GeoLP; E and F be two
objects in CohP(P2) such that their Chern characters v and w are not zero, then

ZP(E) and ZP(F) are on the same ray

The following lemma translates the comparison of slopes into a geometric compari-
son of the positions of two rays. This simpliﬁes a lot of computations and will be used
throughout the paper.
Lemma 1.17. Let P = (1, s, q) be a point in GeoLP, E and F be two objects in Coh#s. The
inequality

holds if and only if the ray l+

An important problem is to study the existence of stable objects with respect to given
stability condition and character. This will be solved in several steps in this paper. Now
we can make the ﬁrst observation.
Proposition 1.18. Let E ∈ Coh#s be a σs,q-stable object, then one of the following cases
happens:

13

1.3 Potential walls and phases

1. The character ˜v(E) is not in the cone spanned by GeoLP and the origin.
2. There exists a slope semistable sheaf F such that in the {1, ch1
ch0
v(F) is above LEP and between the vertical walls lE+ and lP+.

, ch2
ch0

}-plane the point

In either case, the line segment lEP is not entirely contained inside GeoLP. In particular,
at least one of v(E) and (1, s, q) is outside the negative discriminant area ¯∆<0.
Proof. Assume that Case 1 does not happen, i.e. ˜v(E) is inside the GeoLP-cone, we need to
show case 2 happens. In particular, ch0(E) is not 0. When ch0(E) > 0, H0(E) is non-zero.
Let F =H0(E)min be the quotient sheaf of H0(E) with the minimum slope ch1
. Then F is a
ch0
slope semistable sheaf, so v(F) is outside GeoLP. Let D be H−1(E) and G be the kernel of
H0(E) → F. We may compare the slopes of E and F

≥ ch1(F)
ch0(F) .
The inequality holds because when D and G are non-zero, we have

ch1(F) + ch1(G) − ch1(D)
ch0(F) + ch0(G) − ch0(D)

ch1(E)
ch0(E)

ch1(E)

=

ch1(F)
ch0(F)

holds only when D and G are both zero. In this case, v(E) = v(F), hence v(F) is inside
GeoLP, which contradicts to our assumption. Therefore, we have a strict inequality, i.e.
v(F) is to the left of v(E). As F ∈ Coh>s, P is to the left of v(F). In addition, as φs,q(E) <
φs,q(F), by Lemma 1.17, F is above lPE, so case 2 happens.
When ch0(E) < 0, let F =H−1(E)max be the subsheaf of H−1(E) with the maximum
. By the same argument, v(F) is to the right of v(E). As F ∈ Coh≤s, v is to the
slope ch1
ch0
left of LP± or on the ray lP−. In addition, since φs,q(F[1]) < φs,q(E), by Lemma 1.17, F is
above lEP. As lF− does not intersect GeoLP, F is to the left of LP±.

For the last statement, since the region ¯∆<0 is convex, for any v(E) and P = (1, s, q)
that are both in ¯∆<0, the line segment lEP is also in ¯∆<0, which is contained in GeoLP. (cid:3)
This induces some useful corollaries. First we get the stability of exceptional bundles

for some stability conditions.
Corollary 1.19. Let E be an exceptional bundle, and P = (1, s, q) be a point in GeoLP,
then E is σs,q-stable if s < ch1
(E) and lEP is contained in GeoLP (not include the end-
ch0
points). In the homological shifted case, E[1] is σs,q-stable, if s ≥ ch1
(E) and lEP is con-
tained in GeoLP.

ch0

Proof. We will prove the ﬁrst statement. If E is not σs,q-stable, then there is a σs,q-stable
object F destabilizing E. We have the exact sequence

0 → H−1(F) → H−1(E) → H−1(E/F) → H0(F) → H0(E) → H0(E/F) → 0.

14

1.4 Algebraic stability conditions

Since H−1(E) = 0, we see that H−1(F) = 0 and v(F) lies between the vertical lines LP±
and LE±. Since φs,q(F) > φs,q(E), by Lemma 1.17, v(F) is in the region bounded by lP+,
lPE and lE+. As lEP is contained in GeoLP, lFP is also contained in GeoLP,. By Proposition
1.18, F is not σs,q-stable, which is a contradiction. The second statement can be proved
(cid:3)
similarly.

Remark 1.20. The condition that ‘lEP is contained in GeoLP’ is also necessary. Any ray
starting from v(E) may only intersect CLP at most once, and only intersect with ﬁnitely
many lee+ segments. Suppose that s < ch1
(E), and lEP intersects some lee+ segments, we
ch0
may choose the one (denoted by F) with minimum ch1
-coordinate. The segment lFP is
ch0
contained in GeoLP, and φs,q(F) > φs,q(E). By Corollary 1.19, F is σs,q-stable. By [GR],
Hom(F, E) (cid:44) 0 when ch1
ch0

(E). This shows that E is not σs,q-stable.

(F) < ch1
ch0

The second corollary roughly says when we vary the stability condition in GeoLP,

stable objects remain stable if the slopes do not change.

Corollary 1.21. Let σs,q be a geometric stability condition and F be a σ-stable object,
then for any geometric stability condition τ on the line LFσ such that lτσ is contained in
GeoLP, F is also τ-stable.

1.4 Algebraic stability conditions
The structure of Db(P2) can be studied via full strong exceptional collections. First recall
the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1.22. An ordered set E = {E1, E2, E3} is an exceptional triple in Db(P2) if E is
a full strong exceptional collection of coherent sheaves in Db(P2).

Remark 1.23. The exceptional triples in Db(P2) have been classiﬁed in [GR] by Goro-
dentsev and Rudakov. In particular, up to a cohomological shift, each collection consists
of exceptional bundles on P2. In terms of dyadic numbers, their labels are given by one of
the following three cases (p is an odd integer when m (cid:44) 0):

We recall the construction of algebraic stability conditions associated to an exceptional

triple.
Proposition 1.24 ([Ma] Section 3). Let E be an exceptional triple in Db(P2). For any
positive real numbers m1, m2, m3 and real numbers φ1, φ2, φ3 such that:

φ1 < φ2 < φ3, and φ1 + 1 < φ3,
there exists a unique stability condition σ = (Z,P) such that

1. E j’s are σ-stable of phase φ j;

15

1.4 Algebraic stability conditions

2. Z(E j) = m jeπiφ j.

Deﬁnition 1.25. Let E be an exceptional triple {E1, E2, E3} in Db(P2), we write AE for the
heart (cid:104)E1[2], E2[1], E3(cid:105), and ΘE for the space of all stability conditions in Proposition
1.24. ΘE is parametrized by

{(m1, m2, m3, φ1, φ2, φ3) ∈ (R>0)3 × R3(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) φ1 < φ2 < φ3, φ1 + 1 < φ3}.

We consider the following two subsets of ΘE.

• Θ(cid:79)E := {σ ∈ ΘE | φ2 − φ1 < 1, φ3 − φ2 < 1};
• ΘGeoE

:= ΘE∩ StabGeo;

We denote StabAlg as the union of ΘE for all exceptional triples in Db(P2). A stability
condition in StabAlg is called an algebraic stability condition.

The next proposition explains how the algebraic part ΘE ‘glues’ onto the geometric

part StabGeo.
Proposition 1.26. Let E be an exceptional triple, then we have:

1. Θ(cid:79)E = (cid:93)GL+(2, R) · {σs,q ∈ StabGeo(P2) | (1, s, q) ∈ TRE}.
2. ΘGeoE = (cid:93)GL+(2, R) · {σs,q ∈ StabGeo(P2) | (1, s, q) ∈ MZE}.

In particular, Θ(cid:79)E is contained in ΘGeoE .

By Corollary 1.19, E3 is stable for any stability conditions in MZE. For the same reason,
E1[1] is stable for any stability conditions in MZE.

For any (1, s, q) in MZE, E3 and E1[1] are in the heart Coh#s. By Lemma 1.17, φs,q(E1[1]) <

φs,q(E3) − φs,q(E1) > 1.

(E2), E3 and E2[1] are in the heart Coh#s, we have

φs,q(E3), hence

When s ≥ ch1

φs,q(E3) − φs,q(E2) > 0.
As (1, s, q) is above Le1e2, by Lemma 1.17, we also have

When s < ch1

Proposition 1.24, we get the embedding

(E2), by a similar argument we have the same inequalities for φs,q(Ei)’s. By

Ker−1(MZE) ∩ StabGeo (cid:44)→ ΘE ∩ Stabnd Ker−−→ P(KR(P2)).

For (1, s, q) outside the area MZE, by Lemma 1.17, at least one of the inequalities:

φs,q(E2) ≤ φs,q(E1), φs,q(E3) ≤ φs,q(E2), or φs,q(E3) − φs,q(E1) ≤ 1

holds. Hence σs,q is not contained in ΘE, the second statement of the proposition holds.

For statement 1, as φ2 − φ1 is not an integer, Θ(cid:79)E ∈ Stabnd. The image of Ker(cid:0)Θ(cid:79)E

The map Ker is a local homeomorphism and the composition is an isomorphism. Since
Θ(cid:79)E is path connected, the two maps are both isomorphisms. We get the ﬁrst statement of

the proposition.
1.5 Remarks on the {1, ch1
In this section, we want to summarize some properties of our {1, ch1

The set-up of the space of stability conditions in the paper is diﬀerent from the classical
(s, t)-upper half plane model. Recall that we visualize a geometric stability condition as
the kernel of its central charge in K(P2) ⊗ R. In particular, when the central charge is
non-degenerate, which is always the case for geometric stability conditions, the kernel is
a straight line in K(P2)⊗ R. We further take the projectivization of K(P2)⊗ R, the kernel of

the central charge is a point on P(cid:0)KR(P2)(cid:1). For a geometric stability condition, to satisﬁes

the Harder-Narasimhan condition, the kernel of the central charge has to separate away
from all the slope stable characters and torsion characters. In particular, the kernel can
only be in the area GeoLP bounded by the Le Potier curve. The (cid:93)GL+(2, R) action does not
aﬀect the kernel of the central charge, and the space of the geometric stability condition
is realized as a (cid:93)GL+(2, R)-principal bundle over GeoLP.
For a point in GeoLP with coordinate (1, s, q), we may write down a stability condition
σs,q = (Zs,q,Ps) with heart Ps((0, 1]) = Coh(cid:93)s and central charge as that in Proposition
and Deﬁnition 1.10:

Zs,q = −(ch2 − q · ch0) + i(ch1 − s · ch1).

Since this diﬀerent convention may upset some readers, we want to brieﬂy illustrate
some advantages of our approach, which will become more clear later in the paper. One
most important beneﬁt is that the characters and the stability conditions are on a same
space. As seen in Section 1.3, the potential wall of w and another Chern character v is

the Chern character (4, 0,−15) in the introduction can now be interpreted from this new
viewpoint.

the usual upper half plane. As explained previously, up to the (cid:93)GL+(2, R) action, GeoLP

rather than on the upper half plane. The quiver region with heart (cid:104)E1[2], E2[1], E3(cid:105) in

characters of exceptional bundles are usually not on the parabola ¯∆0 (this is the case
only for line bundles), the end points of the semicircular potential walls of them involve
complicated computation. On the (s, t)-upper half plane, only quiver regions for heart
(cid:104)O(k− 1)[2],O(k)[1],O(k + 1)(cid:105) can be neatly described. In this paper ,we need the general

ble area for exceptional characters, and are useful to understand the eﬀective and movable

1.6 First constraint on the last wall
For a character, it is important to study the set of stability conditions for which there exist
stable objects of the given character. We call this set the stable area of the character. In
this section, we give a ﬁrst constraint on the stable area.
Proposition 1.27. Let w be a Chern character such that ch0(w) > 0 and ¯∆(w) > 0, and E
be an exceptional bundle such that ch1(E)
ch0(w). Suppose w is above the line Lele+ in the
{1, ch1
}-plane, then for any point P ∈ GeoLP below LwE and to the left of LE±, there is
no σP-semistable object F with Chern character w.
Remark 1.28. When ch0(w) = 0, there is a similar statement. The conditions are replaced
by ‘ch1(w) > 0’ and ‘ ch2
(w) is greater than the slope of Lele+’. The proof is similar and left
ch1
to the readers.

ch0(E) < ch1(w)

Proof. By the assumptions and Corollary 1.21, we may assume that P is in MZE for an
exceptional triple E = {E1, E2, E3} such that ch1
(E) and e3 is above lPw. By
. E3 satisﬁes the
an easy geometric property of CLP, the character w is also above Lel
assumptions, without loss of generality, we may assume that E3 = E.

(E3) ≤ ch1

We argue by contradiction. Assume F is a σP-stable object with Chern character w.

ch0

As σP is below LwE, by Lemma 1.17, we have

φP(F) < φP(E).

Since E and F are both σP-semistable, we have

Hom(E, F) = 0.

On the other hand, since P is in MZE, it is to the right of LE(−3)±. Therefore, E(−3)[1] and
F are in a same heart, we have

(Hom(E, F[2]))∗ = Hom(F, E(−3)) = Hom(F, E(−3)[1][−1]) = 0.

The two Hom vanishings imply χ(E, F) ≤ 0. But by assumptions that ch0(F) ≥ 0, and w
is above the line Lele+, which is given by χ(E,−) = 0, we have χ(E, F) > 0. This leads to
(cid:3)
a contradiction.
Remark 1.29. The symmetric statement for w with ch0(w) < 0 above Le+er and for E with
larger ch1
ch0

can be proved in the same way.

Now we have the following result on characters of Bridgeland stable objects. Note that

this is a generalization of Theorem 1.8 to Bridgeland stable objects.

Corollary 1.30. Fix a character w. Suppose that there exist σs,q-semistable objects of
character w for some geometric stability condition σs,q. Then w either lies not inside
ConeLP or is proportional to an exceptional character.

Proof. Suppose w is inside ConeLP and not proportional to any exceptional character, by
Proposition 1.18, there is an exceptional character e such that e is above the line segment
lwσ and between vertical walls Lw± and Lσ±. We may assume that ch1(w)
ch0(w) > s, then w is
above Lele+. Now by Proposition 1.27, since σ is below Lwe and to the left of Le±, there is
(cid:3)
no σ-semistable object of character w, which is a contradiction.

We also want to introduce the following important notion.

Deﬁnition 1.31. Let L be a straight line in the {1, ch1

diameter of the semicircular potential wall of E and F. This is a measure of the size of the
wall, and we have the following result, which says for walls of small length, there exists
no stable object.

of LO(c+1)±. Note that LO(c−1)O(c) is just LO(c+1)+O(c)l, by Proposition 1.27,there is no σ-stable

Remark 1.33. If F is σ-stable, in the proof we can see that below LσF there exist the
characters of at least two line bundles O(c − 1) and O(c).

2 Wall-crossing and canonical line bundles

In this section, we prove our ﬁrst main theorem: the wall crossing in stability condition
space induces the MMP for moduli of sheaves on P2. In Section 2.1, we review the con-
struction of moduli space of semistable objects as moduli of quiver representations. In
Section 2.2, we prove the main technical result on vanishing of certain Ext2. In Section

20

2.1 Construction of the moduli space

2.3, the generic stability of extension objects is proved. This will be used in the proof of
the irreducibility of moduli of stable objects, which occupies Section 2.4. We rephrase
some results from variation of GIT in our situation in Section 2.5, and use this to prove
our main theorem in Section 2.6.

2.1 Construction of the moduli space
In this section, we review the construction of the moduli space of σ-semistable objects on
P2 with a given character via the geometric invariant theory. Let w be a Chern character
and σs,q be a geometric stability condition, we write Ms(ss)
σs,q (w) for the moduli space of
σs,q-(semi)stable objects in Coh#s with character w. The line Lwσs,q passes through MZE
for some exceptional triple E. We may choose a point P in MZE for some E such that the
line segment lPσs,q is contained in GeoLP. By Corollary 1.21, the moduli space Mss
σs,q(w) is
the same as Mss
Let E be the exceptional triple consisting of E1, E2 and E3, and let AE be the heart
(cid:104)E1[2], E2[1], E3(cid:105). We write the phase φP(Ei) of Ei at σP as φi. By Proposition 1.26,
φ1 < φ2 < φ3 and −1 < φ1 < φ3 − 1 < 0. There is a real number t, 0 < t < 1, such that
−2 < φ1−t < −1 < φ2−t < 0 < φ3−t < 1. Let the heart CohP[t] be generated by σP-stable
objects with phase in (t, t + 1], then it contains σP-stable objects E1[2], E2[1] and E3. By
Lemma 3.16 in [Ma], CohP[t] = AE. For any σP-stable object F in CohP of character w,
the phase φP(F) only depends on w, and is denoted by φP(w). When φP(w)− t > 0, F is an
object in AE. In particular, when F is a coherent sheaf, there is a ‘resolution’ for F given
as

σP(w).

0 → E⊕n1

1 → E⊕n2

2 → E⊕n3

3 → F → 0.

The character (cid:126)n = (n1, n2, n3) is the unique triple such that n1˜v(E1)−n2˜v(E2)+n3˜v(E3) = w.
When φP(w) − t ≤ 0, F[1] is an object in AE. When F is a coherent sheaf, it appears as
the cohomological sheaf at the middle term of
1 → E⊕n2
E⊕n1

2 → E⊕n3

.

The character (cid:126)n = (n1, n2, n3) is the unique triple such that n1˜v(E1) − n2˜v(E2) + n3˜v(E3) =
−w. The following easy lemma is useful to determine whether F or F[1] is in AE.
Lemma 2.1. Let P be a point in MZE, and F be a σP-stable object in Coh#P. If LPF is
above e3, then F is in the heart AE. If LPF is above e1, then F[1] is in the heart AE.
Proof. By Lemma 1.17, when LPF is above e3, we have the inequality φP(F) ≥ φP(E3).
Therefore, φP(F) − t > 0 and F is in AE. When LPF is above e1, we have φP(F) <
φP(E1[1]). Therefore, φP(F) − t < φP(E1[1]) − t < 0 and F is in AE[−1].

Remark 2.2. The case when P is in TRE and LPF is below both e1 and e3 seems to be
missing from the lemma. However, in this case, by Proposition 1.27, F is not σP-stable.
We deﬁne QE = (Q0, Q1) to be the quiver associated to the exceptional triple E. The set
Q0 has three vertices v1, v2 and v3. The arrow set Q1 consists of hom(E1, E2) arrows from
v1 to v2 and hom(E2, E3) arrows from v2 to v3. Let (cid:126)n = (n1, n2, n3) be a dimension character
for QE, and Hk be a complex linear space of dimension k, then the representation space

Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)n(cid:1) can be identiﬁed with

{(I, J)|I ∈ Hom(Hn1, Hn2) ⊗ Hom(E1, E2), J ∈ Hom(Hn2, Hn3) ⊗ Hom(E2, E3)}.

We denote the composition map between Ei’s by αE:

αE : Hom(E1, E2) ⊗ Hom(E2, E3) → Hom(E1, E3).

This gives a relation of the quiver QE and we have the space of quiver representations
with relation:

Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)n, αE(cid:1) := {(I, J) ∈ Rep(QE, (cid:126)n) | J ◦ I ∈ Hom(Hn1, Hn3) ⊗ ker αE}.
As a subvariety of Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)n(cid:1), Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)n, αE(cid:1) is determined by JI = 0, which con-
be written as a representation KF (unique up to the G(cid:126)n-action) in Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)n, αE(cid:1).
Deﬁnition 2.3. Let K = (I, J) and K(cid:48) = (I(cid:48), J(cid:48)) be two objects in Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)n, αE(cid:1) and

tains n1n3hom(E1, E3) equations.
The category AE is equivalent to the category of ﬁnite dimensional modules over the
path algebra (QE, αE). Any object F in AE with character n1˜v(E1)− n2˜v(E2) + n3˜v(E3) can

Rep(QE, (cid:126)n(cid:48), αE), respectively. We introduce notations for the following sets of homomor-
phisms.

Let F and G be two objects in AE, KF and KG be their representations in Rep(QE, αE).

The Exti groups of F and G can be computed via KF and KG.
Lemma 2.4. The Ext∗(F, G) groups are the cohomology of the complex

In particular,

Let (cid:126)ρ be a weight character for objects in Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)n(cid:1), in particular, (cid:126)n·(cid:126)ρ = 0. An object

K in Rep(Q, (cid:126)n) is (cid:126)ρ-(semi)stable if and only if for any non-zero proper sub-representation
K(cid:48) of K with dimension character (cid:126)n(cid:48) < (cid:126)n, we have (cid:126)n(cid:48) · (cid:126)ρ < (≤) 0.
Now we want to relate Bridgeland stability of objects to King stability of quiver repre-
sentations. Let L be a line on the {1, ch1
}-plane not at the inﬁnity. Suppose L intersects
le1e3 for an exceptional triple E(= {E1, E2, E3}). Let f be a linear function with variables
ch0, ch1 and ch2 such that the zero locus of f is L. Moreover we assume that f (˜v(E1)) is
positive. The weight character (cid:126)ρL,E is given by

, ch2
ch0

ch0

( f (˜v(E1)),− f (˜v(E2)), f (˜v(E3)))

up to a positive scalar.
Lemma 2.5. Let F be an object in AE and P be a point in MZE such that LFP intersects
le1e3, then F (or F[−1]) is σP-(semi)stable if and only if KF is (cid:126)ρLFP,E-(semi)stable.
Proof. First we want to modify the stability condition in a way that the central charge of
the exceptional bundles are better behaved, and the weight character remains the same.
Since LFP intersects le1e3, by Corollary 1.21, we may assume P is in the triangle area TRE.
The central charges of objects E1[2], E2[1] and E3 are

ZP(E1[2]) = −ch2(E1) + q ch0(E1) + (ch1(E1) − s ch0(E1))i;
ZP(E2[1]) = ch2(E2) − q ch0(E2) − (ch1(E2) − s ch0(E2))i;
ZP(E3) = −ch2(E3) + q ch0(E3) + (ch1(E3) − s ch0(E3))i.

23

2.1 Construction of the moduli space

There is a suitable real number 0 < t < 1 such that the new central charge Z•
maps E1[2], E2[1] and E3 to the upper half plane in C.

P := eiπtZP
(cid:16)
Now we can rewrite the stability condition in terms of the weight character. Write (cid:126)Z•

In other words, suppose the dimension vector of KF is (cid:126)n = (n1, n2, n3), then for any
nonzero proper sub-representation KF(cid:48) with dimension vector (cid:126)n(cid:48),

Let (cid:126)ρ• be the vector

Since each factor of (cid:126)b• is non-negative, the inequality (1) holds if and only if

(cid:126)n · (cid:126)a•

if and only if (cid:126)n(cid:48) · (cid:126)ρ• < (≤)0.
and (cid:126)b. As Z•

function:

We can also write (cid:126)ZP := (ZP(E1[2]), ZP(E2[1]), ZP(E3)) = (cid:126)a + (cid:126)bi for two real vectors (cid:126)a

= eiπtZP, the character (cid:126)ρ := ((cid:126)b · (cid:126)n)(cid:126)a − ((cid:126)a · (cid:126)n)(cid:126)b is the same as (cid:126)ρ•.

At last we need to show that (cid:126)ρ is (cid:126)ρLFP,E up to a positive scalar. Let f be the linear

P

f (ch0, ch1, ch2) := ((cid:126)a · (cid:126)n)(ch1 − s ch0) − ((cid:126)b · (cid:126)n)(−ch2 + q ch0).

The zero locus of f contains P because f (1, s, q) = 0. We also have

f (˜v(F)) = f (n1˜v(E1) − n2˜v(E2) + n3˜v(E3)) = ((cid:126)a · (cid:126)n)((cid:126)b · (cid:126)a) − ((cid:126)b · (cid:126)n)((cid:126)a · (cid:126)b) = 0.

Therefore, the zero locus of f also contains v(F).

It is easy to check that

(cid:35)

(cid:34)a1 a3

( f (v(E1)),− f (v(E2)), f (v(E3)))
(cid:35)

is the vector (cid:126)ρ. Since P is above the line LE1E2, φP(E2[1]) < φP(E1[2]) and the determinant
< 0. Therefore, the ﬁrst factor of (cid:126)ρ•, which is
det

< 0. Similarly, det

Now f satisﬁes the desired properties, and induces the weight character (cid:126)ρ. Any other

f satisfying the same properties induces the same character up to a positive scalar.

Remark 2.6. By the construction, the character (cid:126)ρLFP,E (up to a positive scalar) only de-
pends on the wall L but not the position of P.

2.1 Construction of the moduli space

To conclude the construction of the moduli space of σ-stable objects via the geometric
invariant theory, we summarize the previous notations as follows. Let w be a character
and σP a geometric stability condition. Suppose P is in MZE for some exceptional triple
E = (cid:104)E1, E2, E3(cid:105) such that LPw intersects lE1E3. We assume that w or −w can be written as
n1˜v(E1) − n2˜v(E2) + n3˜v(E3) for a positive dimension character (cid:126)nw= (n1, n2, n3). Let G(cid:126)n be
the group GL(Hn1)× GL(Hn2)× GL(Hn3) acting naturally on the space of Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)
and Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw) with stabilizer containing the scalar group C×.
Proposition 2.7. Adopt the notation as above, the moduli space Mss
σP-semistable objects in Coh(cid:93)P can be constructed as the GIT quotient space

σ (−w) of

σ (−w)
Proof. By the previous discussion and Lemma 2.5, the moduli space Mss
parameterizes the (cid:126)ρLwσ,E-semistable objects in AE with dimension character (cid:126)nw. By King’s
criterion, Proposition 3.1 in [Ki], K in Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αw) is (cid:126)ρLwσ-semistable if the point of
K in the space Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw) is det(cid:126)ρLwσ -semistable with respect to the G(cid:126)nw/C×-action. The
map

.

is surjective because the group G = G(cid:126)nw/C× is semisimple. Therefore, the relation αE
does not aﬀect the stability condition. In other words, a point K is det(cid:126)ρLwσ -semistable
with respect to the G(cid:126)nw/C×-action on the space Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw) if and only if on the space

Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)n, αE(cid:1). As explained in Chapter 2.2 in [Gi] by Ginzburg, the moduli space is

constructed as the GIT quotient in the proposition.

Now we have the following consequence on the ﬁniteness of actual walls.

σ (w).

Proposition 2.8. 1. Let w be a character in K(P2), then there are only ﬁnitely many actual
walls for Mss
2. Suppose ch0(w) > 0, then for any s < ch1

(w) and q large enough (depending on s), the
GM (w) of Gieseker (semi)stable

σs,q (w) is the same as the moduli space Ms(ss)

Proof. By Corollary 1.32, we only need to consider the region from the vertical wall to
the tangent line of ¯∆0. We may choose ﬁnitely many quiver region MZE such that each ray
from w contained in this region passes through at least one MZE. In each MZE, there are
ﬁnitely many walls, because there are only ﬁnitely many dimension vectors of possible
destabilizing subobjects.

The second statement is a consequence of the ﬁrst statement and the standard fact that
(cid:3)

σs,q tends to Gieseker stable condition when q tends to inﬁnity.

2.2 The Ext2 vanishing property

2.2 The Ext2 vanishing property
In this section we prove the most important technical lemma. It is about the vanishing
property of Ext2 of σ-stable objects. This property is trivial in the slope stable situation
by Serre duality. But it is more involved in the Bridgeland stability situation since the
objects may not be in the same heart.
Lemma 2.9. Let σP be a geometric stability condition with P in ¯∆<0, E and F be two
σP-stable objects in Coh(cid:93)P. Suppose P, v(E) and v(F) are collinear, then

Hom(E, F[2]) = Hom(F, E[2]) = 0.

Proof. Case 1: At least one of ˜v(E) and ˜v(F) is an exceptional character. Assume that
˜v(E) is exceptional. Suppose the dyadic number corresponding to ˜v(E) is p
2q , let E1 and E3
be exceptional bundles corresponding to dyadic numbers p−1
respectively. Then
Hom(E1, E) and Hom(E, E3) are both non-zero. As E is σ-stable, lEσ does not intersect
le1e+
3 , otherwise this contradicts to Lemma 1.17. We may assume that σ is in MZE,
where E = {E1, E, E3}. As F has the same phase with E at σ, F[1] is in AE. Since

Hom(E[1], E1[2 + s]) = 0 for all s ∈ Z;
Hom(E[1], E[1 + s]) = 0 for all s (cid:44) 0;
Hom(E[1], E3[s]) = 0 for all s (cid:44) 1,

Hom(E[1], G[s]) = 0, for any object G in AE when s (cid:44) 0 or 1. Therefore, Hom(E, F[2])
= Hom(E[1], F[1 + 2]) = 0. Similarly, We have Hom(G, E[1 + s]) = 0, for any object G
in AE when s (cid:44) 0 or 1. Therefore, Hom(F, E[2]) = 0.

LEF and LE(−3)F(−3) is in ¯∆≤0. By Corollary 1.21, the objects E, F, E(−3) and F(−3) are all

Since E is σP-stable, by Corollary 1.32 and its proof, there exists an integer k such
that the points v(O(k + 1)), which is
and v(O(k + 2)) are below the segment
LEF
respectively). Equivalently, the points v(O(k − 1)) and v(O(k − 2)) are below the segments
LE(−3)F(−3)
Let Ek be the exceptional triple (cid:104)O(k − 1),O(k),O(k + 1)(cid:105), then by our assumption,
LO(k−1)O(k+1) must intersect both LEF and LE(−3)F(−3). By Lemma 2.1, as the point v(O(k+1))
is below the segment LEF
the segment LE(−3)F(−3)

(cid:84) ¯∆≤0 (see above picture, where e1, e2, e3 correspond to O(k + 2), O(k + 3), O(k + 4)
(cid:84) ¯∆≤0, E and F are both in AEk. As the point v(O(k−1)) is below
(cid:84) ¯∆≤0, both E(−3)[1] and F(−3)[1] are in AEk. Therefore, we have

Hom(E, F(−3)) = Hom(E, (F(−3)[1])[−1]) = 0.

By Serre duality, the statement holds.

(cid:3)

In particular, if an object E is σ-semistable for some geometric stability condition σ,
we have Hom(E, E[2]) = 0. To see this, E admits σ-stable Jordan-Holder ﬁltrations, and
for any two stable factors we have the Hom(−,−[2]) vanishing, hence Hom(E, E[2]) = 0.

As an immediate application, Rep(QE, (cid:126)n, αE)(cid:126)ρ−ss is smooth.

Corollary 2.10. Let x be a point in Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)(cid:126)ρ−ss, then as a closed subvariety of
Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw), Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE) is smooth at the point x.
Proof. Let K = (I0, J0) be the quiver representation that x stands for. The dimension of
the Zariski tangent space at x is the dimension of

(cid:16)C[Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw)]
(cid:46)

(cid:17)
(J ◦ I) , C[t]/(t2)

HomC

at (I0, J0). Each tangent direction can be written in the form (I0, J0) + t(I1, J1). In order to
satisfy the equation J ◦ I ∈ (t2), we need

J0 ◦ I1 + J1 ◦ I0 = 0.

27

2.3 Generic stability

Hence the space of (I1, J1) is just the kernel of d1 : Hom1(K, K) → Hom2(K, K). By
Lemma 2.9, d1 is surjective. The Zariski tangent space has dimension hom1(K, K) −
hom2(K, K). On the other hand, Rep(QE, (cid:126)n, αE) is the zero locus of n1n3 · hom(E1, E3) =
hom2(K, K) equations, hence each irreducible component is of dimension at least hom1(K, K)
− hom2(K, K), which is not less than the dimension of the Zariski tangent space at x.
(cid:3)
Therefore, Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE) is smooth at the point x.
Remark 2.11. When the dimension character (cid:126)n is primitive, G(= G(cid:126)nw/C×) acts freely on
the stable locus. By Luna’s ´etale slice theorem,

Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)(cid:126)ρ−s → Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)(cid:126)ρ−s(cid:46)

G

is a principal G-bundle. Since Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)(cid:126)ρ−s is smooth, by Proposition IV.17.7.7 in
[Gr], the base space is also smooth.

2.3 Generic stability
Based on Lemma 2.9, we establish some estimate on the dimension of strictly semistable
objects in this section. The technical result Lemma 2.13 is useful in the proof for the
irreducibility of the moduli space.
Deﬁnition 2.12. Suppose (cid:126)n = (cid:126)n(cid:48) + (cid:126)n(cid:48)(cid:48) such that (cid:126)n(cid:48) · (cid:126)ρ = (cid:126)n(cid:48)(cid:48) · (cid:126)ρ = 0. Choose F ∈
Rep(QE, (cid:126)n(cid:48), αE)(cid:126)ρ−ss and G ∈ Rep(QE, (cid:126)n(cid:48)(cid:48), αE)(cid:126)ρ−ss. We write Rep(QE, F, G) as the subspace
in Rep(QE, (cid:126)n, αE)(cid:126)ρ−ss consisting of representations K that can be written as an extension
of G by F:

0 → F → K → G → 0.

We also write Rep(QE, (cid:126)n(cid:48), (cid:126)n(cid:48)(cid:48)) for the union of all Rep(QE, F, G) such that F ∈ Rep(QE, (cid:126)n(cid:48), αE)(cid:126)ρ−ss
and G ∈ Rep(QE, (cid:126)n(cid:48)(cid:48), αE)(cid:126)ρ−ss.

We have the following dimension estimate for Rep(QE, F, G):

Lemma 2.13.

dim Rep(QE, F, G) ≤ −χ(G, F) + dim G(cid:126)n − hom(F, F) − hom(G, G).

Proof. Let X(F, G) be the subset of Rep(QE, F, G) consisting of objects of the form:

2.3 Generic stability

Due to the condition that J ◦ I ∈ ker αE ⊗ Hom(Cn1, Cn3), the pair (I(G, F), J(G, F)) is
contained in the kernel of the morphism

d1(G, F) : Hom1(G, F) → Hom2(G, F).

By Lemma 2.9, d1(G, F) is surjective, hence

dim X(F, G) ≤ hom1(G, F) − hom2(G, F).

D ∈ Hom(G, G) and C = 0, we have g · X(F, G) = X(F, G). Therefore,

The following proposition shows that given a Chern character w not inside ConeLP and
σ (w). Note

a generic stability condition σ, stable objects are dense in the moduli space Mss
that this is a non-trivial statement only when w is not primitive.
Proposition 2.15. Let (cid:126)n be a character for Rep(QE, αE) such that χ((cid:126)n, (cid:126)n) ≤ −1. Let (cid:126)ρ be
a generic weight with respect to (cid:126)n, in other words, (cid:126)ρ · (cid:126)n(cid:48) (cid:44) 0 for any (cid:126)n(cid:48) < (cid:126)n that is not
proportional to (cid:126)n. We have

dim Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)n, αE(cid:1)(cid:126)ρ−ss = −χ((cid:126)n, (cid:126)n) + dim G(cid:126)n,
for each irreducible component of Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)n, αE(cid:1)(cid:126)ρ−ss. Moreover,

(cid:16)
Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)n, αE(cid:1)(cid:126)ρ−ss \ Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)n, αE(cid:1)(cid:126)ρ−s(cid:17) ≤ −χ((cid:126)n, (cid:126)n) + dim G(cid:126)n − 1.

dim

In particular, there is no component whose objects are all strictly semistable objects.

Proof. The ﬁrst statement basically follows from the proof of Corollary 2.10. Just note
that hom1(K, K) − hom2(K, K) in that proof is exactly −χ((cid:126)n, (cid:126)n) + dim G(cid:126)n here. We will
repeat the proof:
Rep(QE, (cid:126)n, αE) is the zero locus of n1n3·hom(E1, E3) equations, hence each irreducible
component is of dimension at least −χ((cid:126)n, (cid:126)n) + dim G(cid:126)n.
Hom2(K, K) is surjective by Lemma 2.9, the Zariski tangent space is of dimension −χ((cid:126)n, (cid:126)n)+
dim G(cid:126)n. Since Rep(QE, (cid:126)n, αE)(cid:126)ρ−ss is open in Rep(QE, (cid:126)n, αE), for each irreducible compo-

On the other hand, for any (cid:126)ρ-semistable object K ∈ Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)n, αE(cid:1)(cid:126)ρ−ss, d1 : Hom1(K, K) →
nent of Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)n, αE(cid:1)(cid:126)ρ−ss, its dimension is −χ((cid:126)n, (cid:126)n) + dim G(cid:126)n.

2.4 The irreducibility of the moduli space

For the second statement, when (cid:126)n is primitive and (cid:126)ρ is generic, we have

Rep(QE, (cid:126)n, αE)(cid:126)ρ−ss = Rep(QE, (cid:126)n, αE)(cid:126)ρ−s,

so the statement holds automatically in this case.
We may assume that (cid:126)n = m(cid:126)n0, in which (cid:126)n0 is primitive. Since (cid:126)ρ is generic, any strictly
semistable object must be destabilized by an object in Rep(QE, a(cid:126)n0)(cid:126)ρ−ss for some 0 < a <
m. Hence

Rep(QE, (cid:126)n, αE)(cid:126)ρ−ss\Rep(QE, (cid:126)n, αE)(cid:126)ρ−s =

2.4 The irreducibility of the moduli space
Based on the results and methods in the previous sections, we are able to estimate the
dimension of the space of new stable objects after a wall-crossing. When the wall is to
the left of the vertical wall, we show that the new stable objects in the next chamber has
codimension at least 3. Together with Proposition 2.15, this will imply the irreducibility
of the moduli space.
Let w be a character in K(P2) with ch0(w) ≥ 0 and σs,q a stability condition with
s < ch1(w)
ch0(w) such that (1, s, q) is contained in MZE. Let (cid:126)n be the dimension character for w
in QE, and (cid:126)ρ be the weight character corresponding to Lwσ. Let (cid:126)ρ− be the character in the
chamber below Lwσ and (cid:126)ρ+ in the chamber above Lwσ. The following two lemmas will be
used in the proof of Proposition 2.18.

30

2.4 The irreducibility of the moduli space

Lemma 2.16. Suppose K is an object in Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)(cid:126)ρ−−s \ Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)(cid:126)ρ+−s, then
it can be written as a non-trivial extension

0 → K(cid:48) → K → K(cid:48)(cid:48) → 0

of objects in Rep(QE, αE) such that the dimension character (cid:126)n(cid:48) of K(cid:48) satisﬁes (cid:126)ρ−·(cid:126)n(cid:48) < 0 =
(cid:126)ρ · (cid:126)n(cid:48), and Hom(K(cid:48)(cid:48), K(cid:48)) = 0.
Proof. By the assumption on K, it is a strictly (cid:126)ρ-semistable object, and is destabilized
by a non-zero (cid:126)ρ-stable proper subobject K(cid:48) with (cid:126)ρ · (cid:126)n(cid:48) = 0. As K is (cid:126)ρ−-stable, we have
(cid:126)ρ− · (cid:126)n(cid:48) < 0. Let the quotient be K(cid:48)(cid:48), then K(cid:48) and K(cid:48)(cid:48) are the objects we want.
In order to see that Hom(K(cid:48)(cid:48), K(cid:48)) = 0, suppose there is a non-zero map in Hom(K(cid:48)(cid:48), K(cid:48)),
then its image ˜K in K(cid:48) is both a sub-representation and quotient representation of K. Let
(cid:126)˜n be the dimension vector of ˜K. As K is (cid:126)ρ−-stable, we get (cid:126)ρ− · (cid:126)˜n < 0 < (cid:126)ρ− · (cid:126)˜n, which leads
(cid:3)
to a contradiction.
For a dimension vector (cid:126)n of QE, we write chi((cid:126)n) for n1chi(E1) − n2chi(E2) + n3chi(E3),

i = 0, 1, 2.
Lemma 2.17. Let (cid:126)n and (cid:126)m be two dimension vectors of QE.
1. The Euler character χ((cid:126)n, (cid:126)m) can be computed as

ch2((cid:126)n)ch0((cid:126)m) + ch2((cid:126)m)ch0((cid:126)n) − ch1((cid:126)n)ch1((cid:126)m)

(cid:0)ch1((cid:126)m)ch0((cid:126)n) − ch0((cid:126)m)ch1((cid:126)n)(cid:1) + ch0((cid:126)n)ch0((cid:126)m).

2. Suppose ch0((cid:126)n) ≤ 0, let w be of character −(ch0((cid:126)n), ch1((cid:126)n), ch2((cid:126)n)) and P be a point in
¯∆<0 to the left of the vertical wall Lw± such that LPw intersects lE1E3. Let (cid:126)ρ be (cid:126)ρLPw, and (cid:126)ρ−
be the character in the chamber below LPw. Suppose (cid:126)m satisﬁes (cid:126)ρ− · (cid:126)m < 0 = (cid:126)ρ · (cid:126)m and (cid:126)n
satisﬁes (cid:126)ρ− · (cid:126)n = 0 = (cid:126)ρ · (cid:126)n, then

ch0((cid:126)n)ch1((cid:126)m) − ch0((cid:126)m)ch1((cid:126)n) > 0.

Proof. The ﬁrst statement follows from the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula for P2:

χ(F, G) = ch2(F)ch0(G) + ch2(G)ch0(F) − ch1(F)ch1(G)

(cid:0)ch1(G)ch0(F) − ch0(G)ch1(F)(cid:1) + ch0(F)ch0(G).

When MZE is to the left of the vertical wall Lw±, we have ch1(Ei)

When MZE intersects the vertical wall Lw±, by formula in Lemma 2.5, (cid:126)Υ is propor-
tional (up to a positive scalar) to the character on the vertical wall. As (cid:126)ρ is to the left of the
vertical wall, (cid:126)Υ can be written as a(cid:126)ρ − b(cid:126)ρ− for some positive numbers a and b. Therefore,
(cid:126)m · (cid:126)Υ = −b(cid:126)m · (cid:126)ρ− > 0.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) > 0. Since the third term of (cid:126)ρ is negative and

ch0(Ei) ≤ ch1((cid:126)n)

ch1((cid:126)n)
ch0(Ei) ch1(Ei)

As ch0((cid:126)n) ≤ 0, we have
the character space of (cid:126)n is spanned by (cid:126)ρ and (0, n3,−n2), the character (cid:126)Υ can be written
as a(cid:126)ρ − b(0, n3,−n2) for some positive number a and b. As (cid:126)ρ− is in the same chamber as
(cid:126)ρ + (0, n3,−n2) and (cid:126)m · (cid:126)ρ− < 0, we get (cid:126)m · (cid:126)Υ > 0.

Now we can give an estimate of the dimension of new stable objects after wall cross-

ing.

Proposition 2.18. The dimension of the space Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)(cid:126)ρ−−s\ Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)(cid:126)ρ+−s
is less than −χ(w, w) + dim G(cid:126)nw − 2.
Proof. By Lemma 2.16, the space Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)(cid:126)ρ−−s\ Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)(cid:126)ρ+−s can be cov-

ered by the following pieces:

Rep(cid:126)ρ−−s\Rep(cid:126)ρ+−s =

Rep(QE, (cid:126)m, ((cid:126)nw − (cid:126)m))(cid:126)ρ−−s,

(cid:91)

(cid:126)m

where (cid:126)m satisﬁes:

• (cid:126)ρ− · (cid:126)m < 0 = (cid:126)ρ · (cid:126)m;
• χ((cid:126)nw − (cid:126)m, (cid:126)m) ≤ 0.

The second condition is due to Lemma 2.9 and Lemma 2.16. Now similar to the proof of
Proposition 2.15, we have

dim Rep(QE, (cid:126)m, (cid:126)nw − (cid:126)m)(cid:126)ρ−−s
≤ −χ((cid:126)nw − (cid:126)m, (cid:126)m) + dim G(cid:126)nw − c − d − (dim G((cid:126)nw−(cid:126)m) − c) − (dim G (cid:126)m − d)

=3(cid:0)ch0((cid:126)nw)ch1((cid:126)m) − ch0((cid:126)m)ch1((cid:126)nw)(cid:1)

The last inequality is due to the second statement of Lemma 2.17.

2.4 The irreducibility of the moduli space

Now we prove the irreducibility of the moduli space of stable objects. This is well
known to hold for moduli of Gieseker stable sheaves. The moduli spaces are given by
moduli of quiver representations, so the dimension of each component has a lower bound.
The point is, by the previous results, the dimension of new stable objects is smaller than
this lower bound, so irreducible component cannot be produced after wall crossing.
Theorem 2.19. Let w be a primitive character in K(P2) such that ch0(w) > 0. For a
generic geometric stability condition σ = σs,q with s < ch1
(w) not on any actual wall of
ch0
w, the moduli space Mss

σ (w) is irreducible and smooth.

σ (w) can always be constructed as

Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)nw, αE(cid:1) //

Proof. The smoothness is proved in Corollary 2.10. We only need to show the irreducibil-
ity.
For any σ, the line Lwσ intersects some MZE. In fact, we may always choose E to be
{O(k − 1),O(k),O(k + 1)}. By Proposition 2.7, Mss

(cid:0)G(cid:126)nw/C×(cid:1) .

(cid:1) determined by n1n2 hom(E1, E3)
Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)(cid:126)ρ+−s in Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)(cid:126)ρ−−s has codimension greater than 2. On the other

det(cid:126)ρLwσE

equations, each irreducible component has dimension at least

n1n2 hom(E1, E2) + n2n3 hom(E2, E3) − n1n2 hom(E1, E3),

which is the same as the dimension of Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)(cid:126)ρ+−s and is greater than the dimen-
sion of the new stable locus Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)(cid:126)ρ−−s\ Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)(cid:126)ρ+−s. Since the stable

locus is open in Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)nw, αE(cid:1), the new stable locus is contained in the same irre-
ducible component of Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)nw, αE(cid:1)(cid:126)ρ+−s. Rep(QE, (cid:126)nw, αE)(cid:126)ρ−−s is still irreducible. Hence

the moduli space of Bridgeland stable objects, given as the GIT quotient, is also irre-

2.5 Properties of GIT

2.5 Properties of GIT
Birational geometry via GIT has been studied in [DH] by Dolgachev and Hu, [Th] by
Thaddeus. Since the theorems in [DH, Th] are stated based on a slightly diﬀerent set-up,
in this section, we recollect some properties from these papers in the language of aﬃne
GIT.
Let X be an aﬃne algebraic G-variety , where G is a reductive group and acts on X
via a linear representation. Given a character ρ: G → C×, the (semi)stable locus is written
as X(cid:126)ρ−s (X(cid:126)ρ−ss). We write C[X]G,χ for the χ-semi-invariant functions on X, in other words,
one has

Denote the GIT quotient by X//(cid:126)ρG := Proj(cid:76)

f (g−1(x)) = χ(g) · f (x), for ∀g ∈ G, x ∈ X.

by F(cid:126)ρ.

C[X]G,(cid:126)ρn and the map from X(cid:126)ρ−ss to X//(cid:126)ρG

n≥0

In additions, we need the following assumptions on X and G:

1. There are only ﬁnite many walls in the space of characters on which there are strictly

semistable points, in the chamber we have X(cid:126)ρ−s = X(cid:126)ρ−ss.

2. X(cid:126)ρ−s is smooth and the action of G on X(cid:126)ρ−s is free.
3. X//(cid:126)ρG is projective and irreducible.
4. The closure of any X(cid:126)ρ−s (if non-empty) for any (cid:126)ρ is a same irreducible component.
5. Given any point x ∈ X, the set of characters {ρ| x ∈ Xρ−ss} is closed.
Let (cid:126)ρ be a generic character (i.e. not on any walls) such that X(cid:126)ρ−s is non-empty. By

assumptions 2 and 3, we have a G-principal bundle X(cid:126)ρ−s → X//(cid:126)ρG = X(cid:126)ρ−s/G.
Deﬁnition 2.21. Let (cid:126)ρ0 be a character of G, we denote L(cid:126)ρ,(cid:126)ρ0 to be the line bundle over
X//(cid:126)ρG by composing the transition functions of the G-principal bundles with (cid:126)ρ0.

In other words, viewing X(cid:126)ρ−s/G as a complex manifold, it has an open cover with
trivialization of G-ﬁbers. The line bundle L(cid:126)ρ,(cid:126)ρ0 is by composing each transition function
on the overlap of charts by (cid:126)ρ0.

Now we are ready to list some properties from the variation geometric invariant theory.

Proposition 2.22. Let X be an aﬃne algebraic G-variety that satisﬁes the assumptions 1
to 5, and (cid:126)ρ be a generic character. The following properties hold:

+ = C[X]G,(cid:126)ρn
for n (cid:29) 1 and L(cid:126)ρ,(cid:126)ρ+ is ample. Let (cid:126)ρ0 be a generic character on the wall of the
(cid:126)ρ-chamber, then L(cid:126)ρ,(cid:126)ρ0 is nef and semi-ample.

+

3. There is an inclusion X(cid:126)ρ+−ss ⊂ X(cid:126)ρ0−ss inducing a canonical projective morphism pr+:

X//(cid:126)ρ+G → X//(cid:126)ρ0G.

4. A curve C (projective, smooth, connected) in X//(cid:126)ρ+G is contracted by pr+ if and only

if it is contracted by X//(cid:126)ρ+G → Proj ⊕n≥0 Γ(X//(cid:126)ρ+G,L⊗n

).

(cid:126)ρ+,(cid:126)ρ0

5. Let (cid:126)ρ+ and (cid:126)ρ− be in two chambers on diﬀerent sides of the wall. Assume that X(cid:126)ρ+−s
and X(cid:126)ρ−−s are both non-empty, then the morphisms X//(cid:126)ρ±G → X//(cid:126)ρ0G are proper and
birational. If they are both small, then the rational map X//(cid:126)ρ−G (cid:100) X//(cid:126)ρ+G is a ﬂip
with respect to L(cid:126)ρ+,(cid:126)ρ0.

Proof. 1. This is true for a general G-principal bundle by ﬂat descent theorem, see [De]
Expos´e I, Th´eor`eme 4.5.
2 and 3. By the assumption 5, X(cid:126)ρ−s ⊂ X(cid:126)ρ∗−ss for ∗ = 0 or +. By the assumption 4, the
natural map: C[X]G,(cid:126)ρn∗ → C[X(cid:126)ρ−s]G,(cid:126)ρn∗ (cid:39) Γ (X//(cid:126)ρG, L⊗n
(cid:126)ρ,(cid:126)ρ∗) is injective for n ∈ Z≥0. Hence the
C[X(cid:126)ρ−s]G,(cid:126)ρn∗ is ﬁnitely generated over
n≥0
C[X(cid:126)ρ−s]G,(cid:126)ρn∗ is birational and projective

base locus of L(cid:126)ρ,(cid:126)ρ∗ is empty. R(X//(cid:126)ρG, L(cid:126)ρ,(cid:126)ρ∗) (cid:39)(cid:76)

n≥0

C[X]G,(cid:126)ρn∗ = X//(cid:126)ρ∗G.

The morphism pr+ maps each (cid:126)ρ∗ S-equivariant class to itself set-theoretically. When (cid:126)ρ+
is in the same chamber of (cid:126)ρ, by the assumption 2, this is an isomorphism, implying that
L(cid:126)ρ,(cid:126)ρ+ must be ample and C[X(cid:126)ρ−s]G,(cid:126)ρn∗ = C[X]G,(cid:126)ρn∗ for n large enough. By the deﬁnition of
L(cid:126)ρ,(cid:126)ρ+, it extends linearly to a map from the space of R-characters of G to NSR(X//(cid:126)ρG).
Since all elements in the (cid:126)ρ chamber are mapped into the ample cone, (cid:126)ρ0 must be nef.

Suppose we ﬁnd such P, then any function f in C[X(cid:126)ρ+−s]G,(cid:126)ρn

Since the base space is projective and connected, it must be a constant on P. Since F(cid:126)ρ+(P)
= C, the value of f on F−1
(C) is determine by this constant. Hence the canonical mor-
phism contracts C to a point.

Let G(cid:48)(cid:48) be the kernel of (cid:126)ρN

For any p ∈ C, since G is reductive and the G-orbit F−1

function f , f (xp) = f (y). The point xp is in Py and therefore F(cid:126)ρ(Py) = C.
0 . By the choices of fi’s, another point xq on Gxp is in Py
if and only if they are on the same G(cid:48)(cid:48)-orbit. Since G acts freely on all stable points, Py
becomes a G(cid:48)(cid:48) principal bundle over base C. As [G(cid:48)(cid:48) : G(cid:48)] is ﬁnite, we may choose a con-
nected component of Py such that viewing as a G(cid:48)-principal bundle, the induced morphism
from the base space to C is ﬁnite. This component of Py then satisﬁes both condition I
and II at the beginning.

5. This is due to Theorem 3.3 in [Th].

(cid:3)
Remark 2.23. When the diﬀerence between X(cid:126)ρ+−s and X(cid:126)ρ−−s is of codimension two in
X(cid:126)ρ+−s ∪ X(cid:126)ρ−−s, since X(cid:126)ρ+−s ∪ X(cid:126)ρ−−s is smooth, irreducible and quasi-aﬃne by the second
assumption, we have:

C[X(cid:126)ρ+−s]G,(cid:126)ρn− = C[X(cid:126)ρ+−s ∪ X(cid:126)ρ−−s]G,(cid:126)ρn− = C[X(cid:126)ρ−−s]G,(cid:126)ρn− = C[X]G,(cid:126)ρn− for n (cid:29) 0.

In this case, the birational morphism between Xs,(cid:126)ρ+ and Xs,(cid:126)ρ− identiﬁes NSR(X//(cid:126)ρ+G) and
NSR(X//(cid:126)ρ−G). It maps [L(cid:126)ρ+,(cid:126)ρ∗] to [L(cid:126)ρ−,(cid:126)ρ∗] for all (cid:126)ρ∗ in either (cid:126)ρ+ and (cid:126)ρ− chamber.

Theorem 2.24. Adopt the notations as above, the actual walls Lwσ (chambers) to the left

of the vertical wall Lw± in the {1, ch1
base locus decomposition walls (chambers) on one side (primitive side) of the divisor
cone of Ms
Proof. Suppose L = Lwσ passes through MZE for an exceptional triple E. By Lemma 2.5,
L associates a character (up to a positive scalar) (cid:126)ρL to the group G(cid:126)nw/C×. By Proposition
2.7, the moduli space Mss

σ (w) is constructed as the quotient space Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)nw, αE(cid:1) //

2.22. Assumption 1 is due to Proposition 2.8. Assumption 2 is due to Corollary 2.10 and
Remark 2.11. Assumption 3 and 4 are due to Theorem 2.19 and its proof. Assumption 5
is automatically satisﬁed in our case.
By Deﬁnition 2.21, the character (cid:126)ρL induces a divisor (up to a positive scalar) [L(cid:126)ρL,(cid:126)ρL]

We ﬁrst check that the G-variety Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)nw, αE(cid:1) satisﬁes the assumptions of Proposition

2. pr+ is birational and has an exceptional divisor;

By Proposition 2.18, in Case 1, we get small contractions on both sides. By Property 5
in Proposition 2.22, this is the ﬂip with respect to the divisor [L(cid:126)ρL+,(cid:126)ρL]. Since the diﬀerent

locus between Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)nw, αE(cid:1)(cid:126)ρL+ and Rep(cid:0)QE, (cid:126)nw, αE(cid:1)(cid:126)ρL− is of codimension at least 2,

their divisor cones are identiﬁed with each other as explained in Remark 2.23. In partic-
ular, before encountering any wall of Case 2 or 3, the divisor [L(cid:126)ρL+,(cid:126)ρL] is identiﬁed to a
divisor [L(cid:126)ρL] on Ms

the boundary of the movable cone. The next destabilizing wall on the left corresponds to
the zero divisor, it must be Case 3. On the other hand, by Corollary 1.32, Case 3 must hap-
pen at a wall before reaching the tangent line. This terminates the whole minimal model
program.

In general, if the boundary of the Movable cone is not the same as that of the Nef cone,
then Case 2 happens. Otherwise, Case 2 does not happen and the procedure ends up with
(cid:3)
a Mori ﬁbration of Case 3.
Remark 2.25. On the vertical wall, the morphism pr+ is the Donaldson-Uhlenbeck mor-
phism. If it contracts a divisor, the vertical wall corresponds to the movable boundary
and the minimal model program stops. If pr+ is a small contraction, the wall-crossing
behavior on the other side of the nef cone is the same as the wall-crossing behavior of
GM(ch0(w),−ch1(w), ch2(w)) on the primitive side.

3 The last wall and criteria for actual walls

In this section, we give a description of the last wall (Section 3.2) and a numerical criteria
of actual walls (Section 3.3). Section 3.1 consists of several useful lemmas.

3.1 Stable objects by extensions
The following lemma is useful to construct new stable objects after wall-crossing.
Lemma 3.1. Let G and F be two σs,q-stable objects of the same phase, in particular, σs,q
is on the line LGF. Suppose we have

φσs,q+(G) > φσs,q+(F), and Hom(G, F[1]) (cid:44) 0.

Let f be a non-zero element in Hom(G, F[1]) and C be the corresponding extension of G
by F, then C is σs,q+-stable.

37

3.1 Stable objects by extensions

Proof. By Corollary 1.21 and Proposition 1.26, we may assume that σs,q is in a quiver
region MZE so that C, F and G are in the same heart AE[t] for a homological shift t = 0
or 1. We write σ for σs,q, and σ+ for σs,q+.
lizing C in AE[t]. We have the following diagram:

We prove the lemma by contradiction, suppose D is a σ+-stable sub-complex destabi-

such that the vertical maps are all injective in AE[t]. Three diﬀerent cases may happen.
If I = 0, then φσ+(K) = φσ+(D) ≥ φσ+(C) > φσ+(F). But F is also σ+-stable, this leads

to a contradiction.

If K = 0, then either φσ(I) < φσ(G) = φσ(C) or I = G. The second case that I = G
is impossible since the extension is non-splitting. In the ﬁrst case, as the phase function
is continuous (by the support property), we have φσ+(I) < φσ+(C). Therefore the object D
does not destabilize C at σ+, which is a contradiction.
If both K and I are non-zero, then since F and G are σ-stable, φσ(I) ≤ φσ(G) = φσ(C)
and φσ(K) ≤ φσ(F) = φσ(C). When both equalities hold, we have I = G and K = F, and
in this case, D = C. If at least one of the equalities does not hold, then φσ(D) < φσ(C).
Again by the continuity of the phase function, we see that φσ+(I) < φσ+(C) and get the
(cid:3)
contradiction.

In general, we also need the following direct sum version, which can be proved in a

similar way.
Corollary 3.2. Let G and F be two σs,q-stable objects of the same phase. Suppose we
have

φσs,q+(G) > φσs,q+(F), and Hom(G, F[1]) = n > 0.

Let f be a rank m map in Hom(G, F⊕m[1]) and C be the object extended by G and F⊕m
via f , then C is σs,q+-stable.

Now we collect some geometric properties of the Le Potier curve. For an excep-
tional character e, by the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula, the equation for Le+er, i.e.

In addition, the ch1

-length of these two points is greater than 3.

2. Let u and v be two Chern characters with ch0(u), ch0(v) > 0 on the CLP such that

their ch1

-length is greater than 3, then χ(u, v) > 0, χ(v, u) > 0.

Therefore, Lep does not intersect le(cid:48)le(cid:48)+ or le(cid:48)+e(cid:48)r.

Proof. 1. We ﬁrst show that Lep only intersects CLP at two points. Since any point on CLP
to the right of er is above the line Leer, we only need to consider points to the left of e.
For any e(cid:48)r to the left of e that is above Lep, it is also strictly above Leer. Since e, er
and e(−3)r are collinear, e(cid:48) is to the left of e(−3). In other words, e(cid:48) satisﬁes that ch1
(e(cid:48)) <
(e) − 3. The slope of Lep > the slope of Lee(cid:48)l > the slope of Le(cid:48)(3)re(cid:48)l = the slope of Le(cid:48)+e(cid:48)r.
For any e(cid:48)l below Lep to the left of e, the line segments le(cid:48)le(cid:48)+ and le(cid:48)+e(cid:48)r are below ¯∆ 1
.

The segment of ¯∆ 1
and they do not intersect Lep. Let q be the intersection point of Lep and ¯∆ 1
( there are two
such points and we consider the one to the left of e). When q is not on any segment of ¯∆ 1
between e(cid:48)l and e(cid:48)r, the intersection points of Lep and CLP are q and p. When q is on the
segment between e(cid:48)l and e(cid:48)r for an exceptional character e(cid:48), the second intersection point
is either on le(cid:48)le(cid:48)+ or le(cid:48)+e(cid:48)r. So there is only one intersection point other than p.

3.1 Stable objects by extensions

Now we can state an important lemma. A similar deﬁnition also appears in [CH2].

Lemma 3.4. Let u and v be Chern characters such that:

1. u and v are not inside the Le Potier cone.
2. ∆(v, u) ≥ 0.
3. In the {1, ch1

, ch2
ch0

ch0

them is greater than 3.

}-plane, Luv intersects CLP at two points and the ch1

-length between

ch0

Then we have

χ(u, v), χ(v, u) < 0.

Remark 3.5. When both ch0(u) and ch0(v) are 0, the third condition does not make sense.
But the statement still holds if the ﬁrst two conditions hold. To see this, note that by the
second condition,

χ(v, w) = χ(w, v) = −2∆(v, w) = −ch1(v)ch1(w) ≤ 0.

Now the ﬁrst condition implies that ch1(w) and ch1(v) are both non-zero, so

−ch1(v)ch1(w) < 0.

Proof. By the ﬁrst condition, u and v are below ¯∆ 1
. By the third condition, let f1 and
f2 be two characters corresponding to the intersection points of Luv and CLP such that
ch0( f1) > 0, ch0( f2) > 0 and ch1
We may assume that v = a1 f1 − a2 f2 and u = b1 f1 − b2 f2 for some non-zero real
ch0
numbers a1, a2, b1, b2, since u and v are not inside ConeLP, we see a1, a2 have the same
sign and b1, b2 have the same sign. Moreover, by the second condition, we have

( f1) > ch1
ch0

( f2).

2

∆(v + au, v + au) ≥ ∆(v − au, v − au)

(2)

for any positive number a. Hence a1, a2, b1, b2 all have the same sign. Without loss of
generality, we may assume they are all positive.

As fi is on CLP, we have

χ( f1, f1), χ( f2, f2) ≤ 0.

By the third condition, the ch1
ch0

-distance of f1 and f2 is greater than 3. By Lemma 3.3,

Combining these results, we have

χ( f1, f2) > 0, χ( f2, f1) > 0.

and

χ(u, v) ≤ −b1a2χ( f1, f2) − b2a1χ( f2, f1) < 0,

χ(v, u) ≤ −b2a1χ( f1, f2) − b1a2χ( f2, f1) < 0.

3.2 The Last Wall

Note that if we have stable objects A and B of characters u and v respectively, satisfying
the conditions in the lemma, then the lemma implies that Ext1(A, B) > 0 and Ext1(B, A) >
0. By Lemma 3.1, this implies the existence of stable objects as extensions on both sides.
This observation will be used in the proof of the last wall to show the non-emptiness of the
moduli, and in the proof of the actual walls to show the existence of objects destabilized
on each side of the wall.

3.2 The Last Wall
In this section, we describe the last wall for a given character w that is not inside the Le
Potier cone ConeLP. By the last wall of w, we mean that for P ∈ ¯∆<0, there is σP-stable
objets of character w or w[1] if and only if P is above the last wall. By result from Section
3, this wall corresponds to the boundary of the eﬀective cone when running MMP. The last
wall is ﬁrst computed in [CHW] and [Wo] by Coskun, Huizenga and Woolf. We would
like to state the result based on our set-up and give a diﬀerent proof. To describe the last
wall for character w, we ﬁrst deﬁne the exceptional bundle associated to w.
Deﬁnition 3.6. Let E be an exceptional bundle, we deﬁne RE to be the closure of the
}-plane (see the
region bounded by Le(−3)reer, lere+, le+el and Lele(−3)e(−3)l in the {1, ch1
picture below). Symmetrically, we deﬁne LE to be the closure of the region bounded by
LE(3)leel, lele+, le+er and LerE(3)E(3)r in the {1, ch1

}-plane.

A similar statement holds for LE.

we have χ( f1, u) = 0, hence χ( f1, w) = 0. The points er and el are on the diﬀerent sides of
the line χ(−, w) = 0, therefore

to the last wall.
Deﬁnition 3.9. Let w be a character not inside ConeLP (see Deﬁnition 1.6), we deﬁne the
exceptional bundle Ew associated to w to be the unique one such that REw contains w.
Similarly we have the deﬁnition of E(rhs)

exceptional vector bundle. We deﬁne the last wall Llast

σ(w) is empty when σ is to the left of the
vertical wall Lw±. When w is of Case 1 or 3 in the Deﬁnition 3.11, the statement follows
from Proposition 1.27 directly.
When w is of Case 2 in Deﬁnition 3.11, we have χ(w, Ew(−3)) < 0. For any σ-stable
F with character w, Hom(F, Ew(−3)[t]) may be nonzero only when 0 ≤ t ≤ 3. Since F is
in Coh#sσ, Hom(Ew, H−1(F)) = 0. By Serre duality,

w and inside ¯∆<0, by Corollary 1.19, Ew(−3)[1]
is σ-stable. By Lemma 1.17, φσ(Ew(−3)[1]) < φσ(F). Therefore, Hom(F, Ew(−3)[1]) = 0.
This leads to a contradiction to the inequality that χ(w, Ew(−3)) < 0.
(cid:3)

The existence of stable objects before the last wall is more complicated. This is ﬁrst
proved by Coskun, Huizenga and Woolf. The authors write down the generic slope sta-
ble coherent sheaves build by exceptional bundles and show that these objects do not get
destabilized before the last wall. Our approach is more close to the idea of Bayer and

43

3.2 The Last Wall

Macr`ı for K3 surfaces. We aim to show that for each wall-crossing before the last wall,
new stable objects (extended by two objects) are generated on both sides, hence the mod-
uli space is non-empty. We may beneﬁt from this approach since the similar techniques
can be applied in the criteria for actual walls.

(cid:0)(w(cid:48) − w)[1](cid:1) may not contain any stable objects. To deal

The proof of the theorem is rather involved, so we want to sketch the idea here. The aim
is to show the existence of new stable objects given by extensions after wall crossing. First,
on any wall before the last wall, the pair of destabilizing Chern characters w(cid:48) and w − w(cid:48)
are between their own last walls and the vertical walls. By induction on the discriminant,
there exists stable objects with characters w(cid:48) and w − w(cid:48). Then by Lemma 3.1 and 3.4, we
show that these objects have non-trivial extensions, and will extend to stable objects after
each wall-crossing. However, several diﬀerent cases may happen so that the idea cannot
work directly. When one of the destabilizing characters is proportional to an exceptional
character, Condition 1 in Lemma 3.4 fails and we need other ways to show χ(w(cid:48), w−w(cid:48)) <
0. The most complicated case is when w(cid:48) is of higher rank and Lright-last
is Lww(cid:48) (Case 3.II.2
in the proof). In this case, Mss
with that, we adjust w(cid:48) − w to another character ˜w on Lww(cid:48) so that ˜w is of positive rank and

We check that the pair w(cid:48) and w − w(cid:48) satisﬁes the conditions in Lemma 3.4:
σ(w(cid:48)) are non-empty, w(cid:48) and w− w(cid:48) are not exceptional.

3.2 The Last Wall

Now by Lemma 3.4, we have χ(w(cid:48), w − w(cid:48)) < 0. For σ-stable objects F(cid:48) and F(cid:48)(cid:48) with
characters w(cid:48) and w − w(cid:48) respectively, and i (cid:44) 0, 1, 2, Hom(F(cid:48), F(cid:48)(cid:48)[i]) = 0 since F(cid:48) and
F(cid:48)(cid:48) are in a same heart and in addition by Serre duality. These imply Hom(F(cid:48), F(cid:48)(cid:48)[1]) (cid:44) 0.
Now by Lemma 3.1, the non-trivial extension of F(cid:48) by F(cid:48)(cid:48) is σ−-stable, therefore Ms
σ−(w)
is non-empty, which contradicts to the assumption that Lσw is the last wall.

Case 2: There are more than two exceptional characters on Lσw. This can only happens
when Lwσ is the line χ(E,−) = 0 for exceptional bundle E = Ew. In this case, w is of Case
3 in Deﬁnition 3.11, Lσw is Llast
w .

Case 3: There are one or two exceptional characters on Lσw.
Similar to Case 1, we consider the character w(cid:48). We ﬁrst prove the ‘lower rank wall’
case, i.e. ch0(w(cid:48)) ≤ ch0(w). In this case, since φσ+(w) < φσ+(w − w(cid:48)), the character w − w(cid:48)
σ(w − w(cid:48)) is non-empty by induction
satisﬁes the condition in Lemma 3.13, therefore Ms

This completes the argument for the lower rank case.
Now we may assume ch0(w(cid:48)) > ch0(w) and let w(cid:48)(cid:48) = w(cid:48) − w, then ch0(w(cid:48)(cid:48)) > 0. On the
{1, ch1
σ(w(cid:48)(cid:48)[1]) is non-
empty, then the argument for the lower rank case still works and implies that Ms
σ−(w) is
non-empty. On the other hand, by induction on ∆, Proposition 2.15 and Proposition 2.18,
σ (w(cid:48)(cid:48)[1]) is non-empty. So the only remaining case to consider is
the semistable locus Mss
that Lwσ is the right last wall Lright-last

w(cid:48)(cid:48) (3) is on the line segment lww(cid:48)(cid:48).

When w(cid:48) is not proportional to any exceptional character, w + ˜w is outside ConeLP and
on the same component of LwE ∩ ¯∆≥0 as w. Since the line segment l ˜w(w+ ˜w) intersects ¯∆<0,
σ(w(cid:48)) is non-empty,
∆( ˜w, w+ ˜w) < 0. This implies ∆( ˜w) < ∆(w) and ∆(w+ ˜w) < ∆(w). As Ms

candidates v. By checking the positions of v and v− w on the {1, ch1
purely numerical data, Theorem 3.16 determines whether Lwσ is an actual wall induced
by this pair. The idea of the proof is very similar to that of the last wall, we ﬁrst show
there are stable objects on the wall with characters v and w− v by Theorem 3.14. We then
argue that the ext1 of the stable objects is greater than 0 by Lemma 3.4, and ﬁnally claim
that curves must be contracted from the σ+-side wall-crossing.

To state the criteria for actual walls, we ﬁrst need to introduce the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.15. For a Chern character w with ch0(w) ≥ 0 and an exceptional character
e, we deﬁne the triangle TRwe to be the triangle region bounded by lines Lwe, Lele+ and
Le+er in the {1, ch1

Now we can state the main theorem on actual walls. The regions TRwE will be used to
detect the non-emptiness of moduli spaces of stable object of any ‘sub-character’, as will
be explained in the proof of the theorem.
Theorem 3.16. Let w ∈ K(P2) be a Chern character outside the Le Potier cone with
ch0(w) ≥ 0. For any stability condition σs,q in ¯∆<0 between the wall Llast
w and the vertical
ray Lw+, the wall Lσw is an actual wall for w if and only if there exists a Chern character
v ∈ K(P2) on the line segment lσw such that:

and both of them are not in TRwE for any exceptional bundle E.

w−v are in TRwE for at most two particular exceptional bundles. Suppose the intersection

2. By the term ‘in TRwE’, strictly speaking, we mean that ‘in the closure of TRwE but
not on the line Le+el when E is not to the right of Ew or not on the line Le+er when E is to
the left of Ew’.
Proof. The ﬁrst step is to show that when v (or w− v) is not inside the Le Potier cone, the
condition ‘v (or w − v) is not in TRwE for any exceptional E’ is equivalent to ‘Ms
σ(v) (or
σ(w − v)) is non-empty for σ in ¯∆<0 on the line Lwv’.
Ms
The ‘⇐’ direction is easy to check: Suppose v is in TRwE for some E, then E must be
Ew or to the right of Ew. This implies lσw intersects le+er. The character v is in RE and of
σ(v) is empty. The w − v part is proved
Case 1 in Deﬁnition 3.11. By Proposition 1.27, Ms
in a similar way.
For the ‘⇒’ direction, let f1 and f2 be the intersection points of the line Lvw and the
parabola ¯∆ 1

for some exceptional bundle E by Theorem 4.1 in [CHW]. Since v is below Leer, Ev is
either E or to the left of E.

Three diﬀerent cases may happen:

1. If v is above Le+el, then Ev = E. Since v is not in TRwE, v is above LEw. This implies

E is below Lvw, and Lvσ is between Llast
v

and Lv±.

2. If E (cid:44) Ew and v is not above Le+el, then w is below the line Le(−3)el and E(−3) is

below Lwv. Hence, Lvσ is between LvE(−3) and Lv±;

3. If E = Ew and v is not above the line Lele+, then by Remark 3.17, v is above Llast

The second step is to prove the ‘only if’ direction in the statement, which follows

point of Lwσ and Le+er and is not in TRwE. By the same argument as in Case 3.II.2 of the

The last step is to prove the ‘if’ direction in the statement. Similar to the proof for the
last wall, objects with characters v and u = w − v do not always have non-trivial exten-
sions. We need to build Chern characters u(cid:48) and v(cid:48) on the line Lvw, such that:

Four cases may happen for u and v:
i) v and u are not proportional to any exceptional characters, in other words, they are
outside ConeLP. Since they are outside the triangles TRwE, Ms
σ(u) are non-
empty. The characters v and u satisfy the conditions in Lemma 3.4 due to the same argu-
ment as Case 1 in Theorem 3.14. This implies χ(v, u) < 0. By the ﬁrst property of Lemma
2.17 and the same computation as in Proposition 2.18, χ(u, v) − χ(v, u) ≤ −3. Therefore,
σ(u), ext1(G, F) ≥ 3. By

ii) v is proportional to the character e of some exceptional bundle E, but u is not
proportional to any exceptional characters. Write v = ne for some integer n ≥ 1. When
ch0(w) ≥ ch0(e), the character u(cid:48) = u + (n − 1)e is to the right of w. Therefore u(cid:48) is not in

iv) The Chern characters u and v are proportional to the characters e1 and e2 of excep-

n2 ≤ n1χ(e2, e1) = n1ext2(E2, E1) = n1 hom(E1, E2(−3)) < n1 hom(E1, E2).

As a consequence, we see that

Here Krhom(E1,E2)(n1, n2) is the Kronecker model, in other words, it is the representa-
tions space of Hom(Cn2, Cn1)⊕ hom(E1,E2) quotient by the natural group action of GL(n1) ×
GL(n2)/C∗.

In all cases, Lvw is an actual wall for w.

(cid:3)

Now the following corollary follows easily:

Corollary 3.18 (Lower rank walls). Let w be a character with ch0(w) ≥ 0. For any char-
acter v with 0 < ch0(v) ≤ ch0(w), suppose that v is between the wall Llast
w and the vertical
ray Lw+, outside the Le Potier cone ConeLP, and not in TRwE for any exceptional bundle
E. Then Lvw is an actual wall.

4 Applications: the ample cone and the movable cone

In this section, we work out several applications of our criteria on actual walls. We com-
pute the boundary of the movable cone in Section 4.1 and the boundary of the nef cone
in Section 4.2. In Section 4.3, we compute all the actual walls of moduli space of stable
sheaves of character (4, 0,−15), as an example of how to apply the machinery in this paper
to a concrete situation.

4.1 Movable cone
Let w ∈ K(P2) be a character with ch0(w) ≥ 0 not inside ConeLP. It has been revealed in
[CHW] that when σ is in the ‘last’ chamber above Llast
σ(w) is of
Picard number 1 if and only if w is right orthogonal to Ew. In other words, the movable
cone boundary on the primary side is not the same as the eﬀective cone boundary if and
only if χ(Ew, w) = 0. In this section, we determine the boundary of the movable cone in
this case.

We next show that w − P is outside TRwE for any exceptional bundle E. By Lemma
3.13, we only need to treat the case when ch0(w − P) < 0. We are going to prove that for

4.1 Movable cone

any exceptional bundle E to the left of Eγ(−3), if E is above LPw, then χ(P − w, E) ≤ 0.
This will imply that w − P is not in TRwE.

In case i),

P − w = n1eβ(−3) − (3ch0(Eβ) · eα − eγ).

By Lemma 4.1 and Serre duality,

χ(3ch0(Eβ)eα − eγ, eα(−3)) = 3ch0(Eβ) − hom(eα, eγ) = 0.

Since χ(eβ(−3), eα(−3)) is also 0, the point P − w is on the line Leα(−3)+eα(−3)r. ch0(w) ≥ 0
implies n2ch0(eα) ≥ n1ch0(eβ). Hence

n1 ≤ ch0(eα)
ch0(eβ)

· n2 < 3ch0(eα).

+ 1 − n1χ(eβ(−3), 3ch0(Eβ) · eα − eγ)
+ 1 − 3ch0(eα) · n1 < 0.

Combining with the result that P − w is on the line Leα(−3)+eα(−3)r, we know that P − w is
not above the curve CLP, and for any exceptional bundle E to the left of eα(−3),

χ(P − w, E) ≤ 0.

On the other hand, the line segment l(P−w)P is above the line L(P−w)eγ, hence above the
line segment leα(−3)reγ. Since leα(−3)reγ is above any exceptional characters between the ver-
tical rays Leα(−3)± and Leγ±, the character P − w is not in the triangle TRwE for any such
exceptional bundle E.

In case ii), the character P − w can be rewritten as follows:

P − w = eγ − w
= n1eβ−3 − (n2 − 3ch0(Eβ))eα − (3ch0(Eβ) · eα − eγ)

eβ−3 − (3ch0(Eβ)eα − eγ).

Note that v(cid:48) is on the line Leα(−3)+eα(−3)r, v(cid:48) is not above CLP. Since v(cid:48) is to the left of Eβ(−3),
after moving along the direction eγ(−3) − eγ, v(cid:48) + a(eγ(−3) − eγ) is still not above CLP or
Leα(−3)+eα(−3)r. Therefore, P − w is not above those two curves. It is not in TRwE for any E
to the left of Eα(−3).
For any exceptional e between Leα(−3)± and Leγ(−3)±, by the assumption, ch0(P − w) ≤
ch0(eγ) < ch0(e). By Lemma 4.2, P− w is not in the area between Le+er and Lee(3). Since w
is above Lee(3), P − w is not in TRwE for any exceptional E between Leα(−3)± and Leγ(−3)±.
The line segment l(P−w)P is above the character eγ(−3), hence above the line seg-
ment leγ(−3)reγ. Since leγ(−3)reγ is above any exceptional characters between the vertical rays
Leα(−3)± and Leγ±, the character P − w is not in the triangle TRwE for any such exceptional
bundle E.
We ﬁnish the claim that w − P is outside TRwE for any exceptional bundle E. By The-

orem 3.16, we know that LPw is an actual wall.

The last step is to show that a divisor of Ms
2.15 and Theorem 3.14, for σ ∈ LPw, dim Ms
dim Ms

σ+(P) = 1 − χ(P, P). By the previous argument, they are both nonnegative.

LPw+(w) is contracted at LPw. By Proposition
σ+(w − P) = 1 − χ(P − w, P − w), and

By Lemma 2.9 and Lemma 3.1,
σ+(w − P, P) = dim Ms

dim Ms

σ+(P) + ext1(w − P, P) − 1

σ+(w − P) + dim Ms
= 1 − χ(w − P, w − P) − χ(P, P) − χ(w − P, P)
= 1 − χ(w, w) + χ(P, w − P)
σ+(w) + χ(P, w − P).
= dim Ms

So it suﬃces to show that χ(P, w − P) = −1. This is clear in case ii):
χ(P, w − P) = χ(eγ, w − eγ) = −χ(eγ, eγ) = −1.

to Theorem 2.24, this is the ﬁrst actual wall to the left of the vertical wall Lw±. We assume
ch0(w) ∈ (−1, 0]. The following lemma
that the character w is primitive, ch0(w) > 0 and ch1(w)
gives an obvious bound for the boundary of the nef cone.

• Given the ﬁrst condition, if ch1(v) is even (odd resp.), let ch2(v) be the greatest

We next show that Lvw is an actual wall. By Corollary 3.18, it suﬃces to prove that v

is not in TRwE for any exceptional bundle E such that −1 ≤ ch1
in TRwE for an exceptional bundle E, then since ¯∆w ≥ 10, the slope of LwE is less than −9.
The ch1

In this way, ch0(w) ≥ ch0(v) > 6ch0(E). In particular, ch0(E) ≤ ch0(w). Note that LwE
becomes a lower rank wall closer to between Lwv and Lw±. By Corollary 3.18, LwE is an
actual wall. But this is not possible by the proof in the ﬁrst part. Therefore, v is not in
(cid:3)
TRwE for any exceptional bundle E.

4.3 A concrete example

Now we can describe the boundary of the nef cone:

Theorem 4.6. Let w be a primitive character with ch0(w) > 0 and ¯∆w ≥ 10, the ﬁrst
actual wall for Ms
GM(w) is given by Lvw, where v is the character deﬁned in Lemma 4.5.
ch0(w) ∈ (−1, 0], and by Lemma 4.5, we only need to show that
Proof. We may assume that ch1(w)
any higher rank actual wall is not between Lvw and Lw±. Let v(cid:48) be a character satisfying
the properties in Theorem 3.16 with ch0(v(cid:48)) = ch0(w) + r for some positive integer r.

(cid:32)ch1(w)

The slope of Lvw is less than
( ¯∆w − 1)/

− ch1(v)
ch0(v)
So the left intersection point of Lvw ∩ ¯∆0 has ch1
v(cid:48) − w is to the left of this point, we get the inequality
