What is the turbulent drag force experienced by an object moving in a rotating ﬂuid?
This open and fundamental question can be addressed by measuring the torque needed to
drive an impeller at constant angular velocity ω in a water tank mounted on a platform
rotating at a rate Ω. We report a dramatic reduction in drag as Ω increases, down to
values as low as 12% of the non-rotating drag. At small Rossby number Ro = ω/Ω, the
decrease in drag coeﬃcient K follows the approximate scaling law K ∼ Ro, which is
predicted in the framework of nonlinear inertial wave interactions and weak-turbulence
theory. However, stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements indicate that this
drag reduction rather originates from a weakening of the turbulence intensity in line with
the two-dimensionalization of the large-scale ﬂow.

1. Introduction

Determining the drag force on a moving object is a central question of turbulence
research and the main goal of aerodynamics. A characteristic feature of turbulent ﬂows
is the “dissipation anomaly”: the drag force becomes independent of the ﬂuid’s viscosity
when the latter is low enough (Frisch 1995). A simple experiment highlighting this
behavior consists in spinning an impeller of radius R and height h at constant angular
velocity ω inside a tank ﬁlled with ﬂuid of density ρ and kinematic viscosity ν: when
the Reynolds number Re = R2ω/ν is large enough, the torque Γ required to drive the
impeller follows the ν-independent scaling Γ = KρR4hω2, where the dimensionless drag
coeﬃcient K depends only on the shape of the impeller.

Here we consider the eﬀect of global rotation at constant rate Ω on this fundamental
experiment: how does the drag coeﬃcient depend on the Rossby number Ro = ω/Ω?
Global rotation is encountered in many industrial, geophysical and astrophysical ﬂows.
Rotating turbulence has therefore been studied intensively using experimental, theoret-
ical and numerical tools (Davidson 2013; Godeferd & Moisy 2015). For strong global
rotation, the behavior of rotating turbulent ﬂows may be summarized as follows: the
large-scale ﬂow structures tend to become invariant along the global rotation axis, in
qualitative agreement with the Taylor-Proudman theorem (Greenspan 1968), while the
remaining vertically dependent ﬂuctuations can be described in terms of inertial waves
that interact nonlinearly, together and with the 2D ﬂow (Clark di Leoni et al. 2014;
Yarom & Sharon 2014; Campagne et al. 2014, 2015; Alexakis 2015). Rotating turbulence
is therefore intermediate between 2D and 3D turbulence; one naturally wonders how its
energy dissipation rate compares to the laminar dissipation of 2D turbulence, or to the
dissipation anomaly of 3D turbulence.

The experiment considered here probes directly the inﬂuence of global rotation on

and the impeller rotate around the same axis (in the laboratory frame, the impeller spins at a

turbulent dissipation. Indeed, torque measurements give access to the drag coeﬃcient:

K = Γ/(ρR4hω2) ,

(1.1)

i.e., to the normalized energy dissipation rate. We report on the behavior of K as a
function of the Rossby number Ro, in the fully turbulent regime where K is independent
of Re, for a rotation axis of the impeller either parallel or perpendicular to the global
rotation axis.

2. Experimental setup

The experimental setup is sketched in ﬁgure 1(a). It consists of a parallelepipedic
water-ﬁlled tank of height H = 55 cm and square base of side L = 45 cm. A brushless
servo-motor drives a four-rectangular-blade impeller of radius R = 12 cm and height
h = 3.2 cm at constant angular velocity ω between 20 and 400 rpm. The tank and the
motor are mounted on a 2-meter-diameter platform rotating at constant rate Ω > 0
up to 30 rpm around the vertical axis. For each set of parameters (ω, Ω), we measure
the time-averaged torque Γ developed by the motor driving the impeller. The maximum
applied torque is Γm = 5 N m. We subtract the non-hydrodynamic torque, determined
for each value of ω by repeating the measurement using air instead of water. This non-
hydrodynamic torque includes losses in the motor and in the o-ring seal through which

the shaft enters the tank. It is determined with a precision of ∆Γ = 50 mN m, allowing
us to span a range of two orders of magnitude in hydrodynamic torque.

Two conﬁgurations are considered. In the ﬁrst conﬁguration, the impeller rotates
around the vertical axis, either cyclonically (ω > 0, ﬁgure 1b) or anti-cyclonically (ω < 0,
ﬁgure 1c); in the second conﬁguration, the impeller rotates around a horizontal axis in the
rotating frame (ﬁgure 1d). These conﬁgurations allow us to examine the two physically
relevant situations of a driving velocity either normal or parallel to the global rotation
axis. The vertical-axis conﬁguration (ﬁgure 1b,c) bears some similarities with the Taylor-
Couette ﬂow between rotating cylinders, the key diﬀerence being that the ﬂow is driven
inertially: the Taylor-Couette geometry is well-suited to study the eﬀect of global rotation
on viscous friction near a smooth wall, while our experiment considers the turbulent drag
due to the inertially driven ﬂow.

3. Drag measurements

We ﬁrst focus on the vertical-axis conﬁguration. Figure 2 shows the drag coeﬃcient
(1.1) as a function of the Rossby number |Ro| = |ω|/Ω. K is related to the spatial
distribution of energy dissipation rate per unit mass ǫ(x) = νh|∇u|2it through the
balance between input and dissipated power: Γ ω = ρV hǫix, where h it denotes a time
average and h ix the space average over the volume V = L2H of the tank. In the absence
of global rotation, because of the large Reynolds number of the ﬂow (Re = 6.4 × 104 to
6.7 × 105), the drag coeﬃcient is independent of Re, K∞ = 0.67 ± 0.02, in agreement with
the fully turbulent scaling law ǫ ∼ R3ω3/h. For nonzero global rotation Ω > 0, the drag
coeﬃcient remains independent of Re, but it is now a function of the Rossby number:
the high-Re data for Γ (ω, Ω) collapse onto two master branches when plotted as K vs.
|Ro|, a cyclonic branch for ω > 0 and an anticyclonic branch for ω < 0.

We ﬁrst consider the high-Ro part of ﬁgure 2. For weak global rotation (large |Ro|),

the two branches split symmetrically about K∞, with drag reduction for cyclonic motion
(Ro > 0) and drag enhancement for anticyclonic motion (Ro < 0). Such small departure
from K∞ can be described through a regular expansion in Ro−1 = Ω/ω, assuming that
the weak Coriolis force can be accounted for perturbatively: writing the velocity ﬁeld
as u = u0 + Ro−1u1 + O(Ro−2), where u0 is the ﬂow without global rotation, leads to
u1|−Ω = u1|Ω. The mean energy dissipation rate per unit mass is hǫix = νh|∇u0|2ix,t +
2νRo−1h∇u0 · ∇u1ix,t + O(Ro−2), where h ix,t denotes space and time average, and
νh|∇u0|2ix,t is the energy dissipation rate of the non-rotating ﬂow. The drag coeﬃcient
becomes

.

(3.1)

The sign of α can be inferred from the fact that global rotation tends to reduce the velocity
gradients along the rotation axis. In the laboratory frame, and for ﬁxed Ω > 0, the ﬂuid
spins faster for cyclonic rotation of the impeller (ω > 0) than for anticyclonic rotation
(ω < 0). As a consequence, we expect lower vertical velocity gradients in the cyclonic
case, i.e., α < 0, implying consistently a negative correlation between the perturbed
vertical derivative ∂zu1 and ∂zu0 in equation (3.1). The data in ﬁgure 3 are in good
agreement with this prediction: the departure of K from K∞ is approximately linear in
Ro−1 for Ro−1 ∈ [−0.07; 0.07], which corresponds to the range |Ro| > 15 in ﬁgure 2.

We now discuss the regime Ro ≃ 1, which is probably the most interesting one:
the cyclonic branch of ﬁgure 2 displays a dramatic drop in drag coeﬃcient, with K
reaching values as low as 12% of K∞ for the lowest Rossby numbers. This decrease
in drag with increasing Ω follows the approximate scaling law K ∼ Ro. A similar –
although less pronounced – decrease in drag coeﬃcient is observed for the anticyclonic
branch. However, it is preceded by a dissipation peak at intermediate Ro: a maximum
dimensionless drag Kpeak ≃ 1.5K∞ is achieved for Ropeak ≃ −12. Once again, this
diﬀerence between the two branches can be related to the eﬀective global rotation
of the ﬂuid: the dissipation peak corresponds to anticyclonic impeller motion ω <
0 partly compensating the rotation Ω > 0 of the platform, so that the ﬂuid has
minimum global rotation in the laboratory frame. A similar peak of dissipation has been

reported for counter-rotating Taylor-Couette ﬂow, and corresponds to optimal transport
of angular momentum between the two cylinders (Dubrulle et al. 2005; Van Gils et al.
2011; Paoletti & Lathrop 2011; Ostilla-M´onico et al. 2014). Such intermediate negative
Rossby numbers also represent the most unstable conﬁguration for vortices in rotating
ﬂows (Kloorsterziel & Van Heijst 1991; Mutabazi et al. 1992), which rapidly break down
into highly-dissipative 3D structures. The Taylor-Couette dissipation peak can then be
traced back to strong instabilities driving dissipative 3D ﬂow structures. In a similar
fashion, the PIV measurements described in section 4 indicate that highly-dissipative 3D
ﬂow structures are responsible for the dissipation peak of the present experiment (see
ﬁgure 4c).

How to explain such a strong drag reduction for rapid global rotation? Two scenarios
can be put forward. A ﬁrst scenario relies on the modiﬁcation of the energy transfers
by the background rotation. In this approach, the velocity ﬂuctuations are described in
terms of propagating inertial waves, which disrupt the phase relation needed for eﬃcient
energy transfers (Cambon & Jacquin 1989). This scenario was ﬁrst put forward in the
context of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence (Iroshnikov 1964; Kraichnan 1965), and
later applied to rapidly rotating turbulence (Zhou 1995; Smith et al. 1996). It predicts
reduced energy transfers ǫ ≃ ǫ∞Ro′ in the limit Ro′ ≪ 1, where ǫ∞ ≃ u′3/ℓ is the usual
(non-rotating) dissipation rate constructed on the turbulent velocity u′ and the energy-
containing size ℓ, and Ro′ = u′/2Ωℓ is the turbulent Rossby number. This result, which
relies on dimensional analysis, can be made more quantitative in the framework of wave
turbulence theory (Galtier 2003; Cambon et al. 2004; Nazarenko 2011). Even though the
latter theory is valid for Ro′ ≪ 1 only (to be compared to the lowest value Ro′ ≃ 0.2 of
the present study, see Table 1), the scaling law K ∼ Ro reported in ﬁgure 2 turns out
to be in agreement with this prediction, if one assumes that u′ ∼ Rω holds regardless of
Ro.

Another explanation for the decrease in drag coeﬃcient is partial two-dimensionalization.

Indeed, the forcing geometry in the vertical-axis conﬁguration (ﬁgure 1b,c) is compatible
with the Taylor-Proudman theorem, which predicts for low Ro a purely 2D vertically
invariant solution corresponding to solid-body rotation in the cylinder tangent to the
impeller, at angular velocity ω in the rotating frame of the platform. This solution
is valid for a perfect ﬂuid only, which slips on the top and bottom boundaries. For a
realistic viscous ﬂuid, additional boundary layers and poloidal recirculations develop and
coexist with the solid-body motion (Hide & Titman 1967; Greenspan 1968). As a matter
of fact, for periodic boundary conditions and idealized vertically invariant forcing, it
was recently proven that the high-Re ﬂow settles in a purely 2D state for low enough
Rossby number (Gallet 2015). For the experiment at stake here, the rapidly rotating ﬂow
can be thought of as a coexistence of this 2D asymptotic ﬂow, together with weak 3D
turbulent ﬂuctuations, the intensity of which decreases as global rotation increases. The
2D ﬂow dissipates very little energy, at a laminar rate, typically proportional to viscosity.
Accordingly, energy dissipation is due to the 3D ﬂow structures, the intensity of which
decreases for decreasing Ro. We therefore expect a decrease in energy dissipation – and
therefore in drag coeﬃcient – for increasing global rotation rate.

4. Turbulent ﬂow structure

To discriminate between the inertial-wave scenario and the partial two-dimensionalization

one, we measure the velocity ﬁeld using a stereoscopic PIV system mounted on the
rotating platform. The ﬁeld of view is vertical, illuminated by a laser sheet containing the
axis of the impeller, and represents one quarter of the tank section, below the impeller

Figure 5. Mean azimuthal (out-of-plane) velocity proﬁle huyit, measured 200 mm below
the propeller (z/H = −0.36), showing the strong two-dimensionalization of the ﬂow for
cyclonic background rotation (Ro > 0). The dashed line shows the Taylor-Proudman prediction
huyit = ωx (solid-body rotation at angular velocity ω in the rotating frame).

(see ﬁgure 1a). Stereoscopic PIV measurements are achieved by two high-resolution
cameras aimed at the measurement plane at an incidence angle of 45◦, at a frame rate
of 5 Hz.

In ﬁgure 4, we show the mean velocity ﬁeld, and the standard deviation u′

p(x, z) of
the poloidal velocity, with and without global rotation. The non-rotating mean ﬂow
corresponds to a toroidal (out-of-plane) ﬂow driven by the propeller, together with a
strong poloidal (in-plane) recirculation. The ﬂow displays 3D turbulence, the intensity of
which is maximum at the edge of the impeller’s blades. In table 1, we provide values of
the turbulent Reynolds and Rossby numbers based on the rms poloidal velocity in this
ﬂow region (red-dashed domain in ﬁgure 4a).

The non-rotating ﬂow contrasts strongly with the rapidly rotating one measured for cy-
clonic impeller motion: in line with the Taylor-Proudman theorem, the mean toroidal ﬂow
gradually tends to solid-body rotation at frequency ω inside the tangential cylinder, while
the mean poloidal recirculation weakens as Ω increases. This two-dimensionalization is
clearly visible in ﬁgure 5, which shows the mean azimuthal velocity proﬁle well below
the impeller (z/H = −0.36). Another consequence of the Taylor-Proudman theorem is a
strong decrease of the 3D turbulent ﬂuctuations for decreasing Rossby number, as can be
seen on the right-hand panels of ﬁgure 4b,d: in the vicinity of the blades, i.e., inside the
red-dashed domain sketched in ﬁgure 4a, both the poloidal and toroidal rms velocities
strongly decrease for decreasing Rossby number (we show only the former), the ratio of
the two being approximately 1.2 regardless of Ro.

The anticyclonic case is diﬀerent: for intermediate global rotation (Ro = −12, ﬁg-
ure 4c), the mean ﬂow displays minimum toroidal component and maximum poloidal
recirculation, and the 3D turbulent structures in the vicinity of the propeller have
maximum intensity. This situation corresponds to the dissipation peak in ﬁgure 2.
However, as global rotation is further increased (Ro = −3, ﬁgure 4e), the measured ﬂows
once again follow the Taylor-Proudman phenomenology, with stronger toroidal mean ﬂow
and reduced mean and ﬂuctuating poloidal velocities (although the ﬂow remains further
from the 2D state than for cyclonic propeller motion).

p /h, whereas the wave turbulence estimate is u′4

On a qualitative level, these observations therefore support the partial two-
dimensionalization scenario: most of the kinetic energy of the rapidly-rotating ﬂow
corresponds to 2D z-invariant motion, which is discarded at the outset of wave
turbulence theories. A quantitative criterion is however needed to distinguish more
clearly between the two scenarios. To wit, we evaluate the energy dissipation rate of
the turbulent poloidal ﬂow directly from the PIV measurements: assuming that the
energy-containing scale is given by the impeller height h, the non-rotating estimate of
this quantity is u′3
p /Ωh2. We compute
the spatial integral of the non-rotating estimate u′3
p /h in the vicinity of the impeller,
inside the dashed region shown in the upper-right panel of ﬁgure 4. We denote as P the
resulting quantity, and report its behavior with Ro in ﬁgure 6. It matches remarkably
the behavior of K, both curves being normalized by their asymptotic non-rotating value,
with K∞/P∞ = 0.6±0.1. This good agreement conﬁrms that energy dissipation is mostly
due to the 3D part of the ﬂow, the laminar dissipation of the 2D ﬂow being negligible.
But more importantly, for the moderate Rossby numbers studied here, it demonstrates
that energy dissipation can be estimated locally from the usual non-rotating scaling-law
u′3
p /Ωh2 predicted by weak turbulence
p /h, ruling out the modiﬁed energy dissipation u′4
theory (such non-rotating scaling-law is also consistent with studies of grid-generated
rotating turbulence (Hopﬁnger et al. 1982; Staplehurst et al. 2008; Moisy et al. 2011),
which showed that the small-scale turbulent ﬂuctuations start developing some rotation-
induced anisotropy for Ro′ . 0.2 only). The quantitative criterion illustrated in ﬁgure 6
allows to clearly discriminate between the two scenarios, and we conclude that drag
reduction originates from a partial two-dimensionalization of the ﬂow, with reduced 3D
turbulent ﬂuctuations.

5. Concluding remarks

The two-dimensionalization scenario for drag reduction is supported so far by the
vertical axis conﬁguration (ﬁgure 1b,c), which is compatible with the Taylor-Proudman
theorem. What if the axis of the impeller is horizontal (see ﬁgure 1d)? Such a conﬁgura-
tion is incompatible with the Taylor-Proudman theorem: there is no vertically invariant
ﬂow solution compatible with the boundary conditions, even for a perfect ﬂuid, because of
the nonzero vertical velocity imposed by the impeller. This geometry therefore prohibits
the partial two-dimensionalization scenario, while it still allows for the inertial-wave one.
The vertical motion of the blades induces 3D turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations of order
Rω, regardless of Ro. The usual non-rotating estimate for the energy dissipation rate
then gives R3ω3/h, from which we predict no dependence of K on Ro, whereas the
wave turbulence prediction gives R4ω4/h2Ω, with a strong decrease in drag coeﬃcient
K ∼ Ro for decreasing Ro. Once again, the data in ﬁgure 2 clearly depart from the
wave-turbulence prediction: for the moderate Rossby numbers considered here, there is
no drop in drag coeﬃcient in this horizontal-axis conﬁguration.

To conclude, we observe strong drag reduction whenever two-dimensionalization is
allowed, i.e., when the forcing geometry is compatible with the Taylor-Proudman the-
orem: the drag coeﬃcient is dramatically reduced for motion perpendicular to the
global rotation axis, while it is very weakly aﬀected for motion parallel to the global
rotation axis. Importantly, for the moderate Rossby numbers considered here, the energy
dissipation rate obeys the classical non-rotating scaling-law, and not the wave-turbulence
one. The decrease in drag is a consequence of a decrease in 3D turbulence intensity, in line
with the two-dimensionalization of the large-scale ﬂow. It would be of great interest to
achieve even faster global rotation, to determine how the ﬂow approaches the asymptotic
2D state: is there a threshold Ro under which the ﬂow becomes exactly 2D (up to
boundary layers), as in the stress-free case considered by Gallet (2015), or is there a
clear-cut scaling-law governing the decrease in 3D energy as a function of Ro?

Such experiments would also indicate how much further the drag can be reduced: for
very fast global rotation, the decrease in bulk dissipation may be hidden by increasing
Ekman friction in the boundary layers, which probably becomes the dominant cause of
dissipation for large Ω. As a consequence, there would be an optimum rotation rate that
leads to a minimum in drag.
