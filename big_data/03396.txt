Topological Symmetries of R

3, II

Fang Sun

March 11, 2016

This paper should be viewed as an extension of [KS]. It deals with orientation
3. All

reversing topological actions of ﬁnite groups G on the Euclidean space R
actions in this paper are assumed to be eﬀective.

Remark 1 This paper combined with [KS] gives complete classiﬁcation of ﬁnite
topological symmetries of R

3, namely:

Theorem 1 Let G be a ﬁnite group acting topologically on R
morphic to a ﬁnite subgroup of O(3).

3, then G is iso-

The structure of this paper is very similiar to that of [KS]. We start with
some preliminary result and then deﬁne six types of Obstruction Kernels, from
Type A to Type F.

Given the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite groups acting (topologically) orientation
3, it is clear the group G is an extension of such group by
presercingly on R
Z2. The Obstruction Kernels will allow us to exclude all possibilities where the
group G is not contained in O(3).

1 Preliminaries

Lemma 1 If f is an orientation reversing involution of S 3 with ﬁxed point set
S 2, then f permutes the two components of S 3 − S 2.

Proof Suppose the contrary horlds. Let S 3 − S 2 be A ∪ B where A, B are
the two components. f restricts to a homeomorphism on A, i.e., Z2 acts on A.
Since A is acyclic, AZ2 is nonempty according to Smith Theory (cf. [B] p.145).
This is impossible since (S 3)Z2 = S 2.
✷

Theorem 2 If D2n(n > 2) acts on R
orientation preserving homeomorphisms, then (S 3)D2n ∼= S 1.

3 such that Zn ⊆ D2n is the collection of

Proof Assume this is not the case. Then (S 3)D2n = [(S 3)Zn ]Z2 = (S 1)Z2 = S 0.
Let a, b be standard generators of D2n. For 0 6 i 6 n − 1, aib is an orientation
reversing homeomorphism, so (S 3)haibi ∼= S 0 or S 2.

1

Case 1: If for all i, (S 3)haubi = S 0, then the ﬁxed point set of any nontrivial
subgroup of D2n is in S 1 = (S 3)Zn . Thus D2n acts on S 3 − S 1 freely. But this
implies (since S 3 − S 1 is a homological 1-sphere) that D2n is cyclic, which is
impossible.

Case 2: If there exist 0 6 i 6 n − 1 such that (S 3)haibi ∼= S 2. Fix i and
= (S 3)hai+2bi, denote
denote (S 3)haibi as S 2
this set as S 2
0 =
(S 3)haib,ai+2bi = (S 3)ha2,aibi = [(S 3)ha2i]Z2 = (S 1)Z2 = S 0. Note that this S 0 is
the ﬁxed point set of D2n and S 0 ⊆ S 2

1 (as the name suggests, it is homeomorphic to S 2). S 2

0 . Now a(S 3)haibi = (S 3)ahaibia−1

1 ∩ S 2

j , j = 0, 1.

Since hai is a cyclic group acting orientation preservingly, (S 3)hai ∼= S 1.

S 0 ⊆ S 1, and S 1 − S 0 has two components. Denote them as R+ and R−.
Claim: For j = 0, 1, R+ and R− lie in diﬀerent components of S 3 − S 2
j .
Proof: Suppose otherwise. The homeomorphism ai+2j b ﬁxes S 2

j , and by the
preceding lemma it permutes the two components. On the other hand, D2n/hai
acts on (S 3)hai = S 1. In particular ai+2jb(R+ ∪ R−) = R+ ∪ R−, but R+ ∪ R−
is mapped to the other component of S 3 − S 2
j which contains none of R+ or
R−. This is a contradiction.

For j = 0, 1, let Aj , Bj be the components of S 3 − S 2

j = (S 3)ha,ai+2j bi = (S 3)D2n = S 0, whence S 2

j where R− ⊆ Aj , R+ ⊆

1 − S 0 ⊆ B0, then A0 ∪ S 2

0 ⊆ A1 ∪ B1 ∪ S 0 by taking complement. So
A0 ⊆ A1 ∪ B1. Since A0 is connected, either A0 ⊆ A1 or A0 ⊆ B1. The latter
is not possible because R− * B1. Thus A0 ⊆ A1. Obviously A0 6= A1 and
A0 ⊂ A1. By deﬁnition, aA0 = A1 and anA0 = A0. Then anA0 = an−1A1 ⊃
an−1A0 ⊃ an−2A0 ⊃ . . . ⊃ A0, a contradiction.

This forces S 2

1 − S 0 ⊆ A0 to be the case. But this is impossible by an

analogous argument as the one above.

Therefore all possibilities lead to contradictions and the initial assumption
✷

fails.

2 Obstruction Kernel

Proposition 1 (Obstruction Kernel of Type A) Let G = (Zp ⊕ Zq) ⋊ϕ Z2,
where ϕ(1) is multiplication by 1(resp. −1) on Zp (resp. Zq). Then G cannot
act on R

3.

Proof Assume such action exists. Note that the subgroup Zq⋊ϕZ2 is a dihedral
group D2q. If G acts orientation preservingly, this is Obstruction Kernel of Type
0 in [KS], thus impossible. So we may assume the action to be not orientation
preserving.

The group Zp ⊕ Zq is the only subgroup of index 2, whence it is the collection
In particular Zq acts orientation

of orientation preserving homeomorphisms.
preservingly.

2

Now Zp ⋊ϕ Z2 = Zp ⊕ Z2. Therefore (S 3)Zp⊕Z2 = [(S 3)Z2 ]Zp . Since
the generator of Z2 reverses orientation, (S 3)Z2 = S 2 or S 0.
In either case
[(S 3)Z2 ]Zp = S 0. Now (S 3)Zp⊕Z2 = [(S 3)Zp ]Z2 = (S 1)Z2 . Note that (S 3)Zp =
(S 3)Zp⊕Zq = (S 3)Zq ∼= S 1, whence (S 1)Z2 = S 0 = [(S 3)Zq ]Z2 = (S 3)D2q . But
by Theorem 4, (S 3)D2q = S 1, a contradiction.

✷

Proposition 2 (Obstruction Kernel of Type B) Let G = (Z4 ⊕ Zq) ⋊ϕ Z2, q
odd prime, ϕ(1) is multiplication by 1 (resp. −1) on Z4 (resp. Zq). Then
3 such that Z4 ⊕ Zq is the collection of orientation
there is no action of G on R
preserving homeomorphisms.

Proof Assume such action exists. By Theorem 2, to produce a contradiction
it suﬃces to prove that (S 3)Zq ⋊ϕZ2 = S 0 (Zq ⋊ϕ Z2 is dihedral and Zq is the
orientation preserving subgroup). We start with computations of the ﬁxed point
sets of various subgroups of G.

Since Z4 ⊕ Zq is cyclic, we have (S 3)Z4⊕Zq = (S 3)Zq ∼= S 1.
The ﬁxed point set (S 3)Zq ⋊ϕZ2 = [(S 3)Zq ]Z2 = (S 1)Z2 is either S 1 or S 0.
The standard copy of Z2 acts orientation reversingly, whence (S 3)Z2 = S 2

or S 0.

Case 1: If (S 3)Z2 = S 0, then this forces (S 3)Zq ⋊ϕZ2 = (S 1)Z2 to be S 0 and

we obtain the contradiction we are looking for.

Case 2:

If (S 3)Z2 = S 2, then (S 3)Z4⋊ϕZ2 = (S 3)Z4⊕Z2 = [(S 3)Z2 ]Z4 =
(S 2)Z4 . According to [E], any action on S 2 is conjugate to an orthogonal one.
Thus (S 2)Z4 is either S 0 or empty. On the other hand, we have computed that
(S 3)Zq ⋊ϕ Z2 is either S 1 or S 0, Combining the two results, (S 3)Zq ⋊ϕZ2 = S 0. ✷

Proposition 3 (Obstruction Kernel of Type C) Let G = Zp ⋊ϕ Z2k+1 , k > 1, p
odd prime, ϕ(1) is multiplication by −1. Then G cannot act on R

3.

Proof Assume such action exists. If the action is orientation preserving, then
G is Obstruction Kernel of Type 2 as in [KS], which is impossible. So it to
consider the case where the action is not orientation preserving.

It is not hard to see that Zp ⋊ϕ Z2k ∼= Z2k p is the only subgroup of G
with index 2. Thus this subgroup has to be the collection of homeomorphisms
preserving orientation.

Let b = (0, 1) ∈ Zp ⋊ϕ Z2k+1. Then b reverses orientation of R

(S 3)hbi ∼= S 0 or (S 3)hbi ∼= S 2.

3, whence

Case 1: (S 3)hbi ∼= S 2.

In this case (S 3)hb2i ⊇ (S 3)hbi = S 2. But b2 is
orientation preserving and thus (S 3)hb2i ∼= S 1, a contradiction. So this case is
not possible.

Case 2: (S 3)hbi ∼= S 0. In this case (S 3)G = S 0. Since Zp ⋊ϕ Z2k ∼= Z2k p
∼= Z2 acts
acts orientation preservingly, (S 3)Z2k p ∼= S 1. The quotient G/Z2kp
on this copy of S 1, so G = Zp ⋊ϕ Z2k+1 acts on the complement S 3 − S 1. The
ﬁxed point set of any nontrivial subgroup H of G is either S 1(when ⊆ Z2k p) or

3

S 0(when H * Z◦k p). Therefore the restriction to S 3 − S 1 is free. As before,
this implies that G is cyclic, which is obviously not the case.

Thus either case leads to a contradiction and the proposition is proven. ✷

Proposition 4 (Obstruction Kernel of Type D) Let G = Zp⋊ϕZ2, p odd prime,
∗
p where n2 = −1(mod p). Then G cannot act on
p ≡ 1(mod 4), ϕ(1) = n ∈ Z

3.

R

Proof The proof of Obstruction Kernel of Type 5 in [KS] carries verbatim. ✷

Proposition 5 (Obstruction Kernel of Type E) Let G = (Zp ⊕ Z4)⋊ϕ Z2, p odd
prime, ϕ(1) is multiplication by 1(resp. −1) on Zp(resp. Z4), then G cannot
3 such that the collection os orientation preserving homeomorphisms is
act on R
Zp ⊕ Z4.

Proof Assume such action exists. Note that Z4 ⋊ϕ Z2 ∼= D8. To produce a
contradiction, it suﬃces (by Theorem 2) to prove (S 3)D8 ∼= S 0.

By our assumption that the action restricted to Zp ⊕ Z4 ∼= Z4p is orientation

preserving, we have (S 3)Zp = (S 3)Z4p = (S 3)Z4 ∼= S 1.

The generator of Z2 reverses orientation, whence (S 3)Z2 ∼= S 2 or S 0.
If (S 3)Z2 = S 0, then (S 3)D8 = [(S 3)Z4 ]Z2 = (S 1)Z2 = S 0, and we are done.
If (S 3)Z2 = S 2, consider the subgroup Zp ⋊ϕ Z2 ⊆ G. By deﬁnition it is
isomorphic to Zp ⊕ Z2. And (S 3)Zp ⋊ϕZ2 = (S 3)Zp⊕Z2 = [(S 3)Z2 ]Zp = (S 2)Zp =
S 0 since any action on S 2 is conjugate to an orthogonal one. On the other hand,
(S 3)Zp⋊ϕZ2 = [(S 3)Zp ]Z2 = (S 1)Z2 . Thus (S 1)Z2 = S 0. Since (S 1)Z2 is also
[(S 3)Z4 ]Z2 = (S 3)D8 , we obtain (S 3)D8 = S 0.
✷

Proposition 6 (Obstruction Kernel of Type F) G = Q4m (the generalized
quaternion group) cannot act on R

3.

Proof The proof follows verbatim from the proof of Obstruction Kernel of
Type 3 (c.f.
[KS]), using the remark following Theorem 2 in the same paper
and Obstruction Kernel of Type C.
✷

3 The Cyclic Case

In [KS], we considered extensions of (ﬁnite) subgroups of SO(3) by Zp, p prime.
In the following sections, the algebraic aspects of the situations are almost
the same as their counterparts in the previous paper. That paper has given
an algebraic description to the possible results of extensions. Thus we will
not repeat the algebra part of those proofs, but to ﬁlter them with the new
obstruction kernels.

Theorem 3 If G acts on R
then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of O(3).

3 such that orientation preserving subgroup is cyclic,

Proof It suﬃce to consider the case where the orientation preserving subgroup
is of index 2.

There is an short exact sequence

0 −→ Zn −→ G −→ Z2 −→ 0

where Zn is the subgroup of orientation preserving homeomorphisms in G.

The algebraic possibilities are known (c.f. [KS] Proposition 3,4,5). We will
investigate then in a way analogous to [KS]. Let n = 2km, m odd. Let ϕ
be the induced action of Z2 on Zn. Let m = P · Q where ϕ(1) restrict to a
multiplication by +1(resp. −1) on ZP (resp. ZQ) (c.f. [KS])

Case 1: k = 0(n is odd).
As in Proposition 3 of [KS], G is either cyclic, dihedral or contains an Ob-

struction Kernel of Type A. In the last case G cannot act. So G ⊆ O(3).

Case 2: k = 1(n = 2m, m odd)
We proceed as in Proposition 4 in [KS].
i)Split Case:
If Q = 1, G = Zn ⊕ Z2, which is a subgroup of O(3).
If P = 1, G is dihedral, thus G ⊆ O(3)
If neither P nor Q is 1, G contains an Obstruction Kernel of Type A, which

is impossible.

ii)Non-split Case:
If Q = 1, then G is cyclic and G ⊆ O(3).
If Q > 1, then G contains an Obstruction Kernel of Type C, a contradiction.
In sum, for n = 2m, m odd, G ⊆ O(3).

Case 3: k > 2
We argue as in Proposition 5 of [KS]. There are four possibilities for ϕ

restricted on the standard copy of Z2k in Zn.

i)ϕ(1) is multiplication by 1.
Split Case: G = Z2km ⋊ϕ Z2. Either P or Q since otherwise there will be

an Obstruction Kernel of Type A in G.

If Q = 1, then G = Zn ⊕ Z2, whence G ⊆ O(3).
If P = 1, then G = (Z2k ⊕ ZQ) ⋊ϕ Z2, thus contains Obstruction Kernel of

Type B. This is impossible.

Non-split Case: In this case G ∼= (ZP ⊕ ZQ) ⋊φ Z2k+1 where φ(1) is multi-

plication by 1(resp. −1) on ZP (resp. ZQ)

If Q = 1, G is cyclic thus isomorphic to a subgroup of O(3).
If Q > 1, G contains an Obstruction Kernel of Type C.

ii)ϕ(1) is multiplication by −1
Split Case: G ∼= Zn⋊ϕ Z2. Again either P = 1 or Q = 1 since an Obstruction

Kernel of Type A will show up otherwise.

5

If Q = 1, then G contains an Obstruction Kernel of Type E, therefore this

case is excluded.

If P = 1, G is dihedral.
Non-Split Case: In such case G ∼= (ZP ⊕ ZQ) ⋊φ Q4m where for some φ, but

Q4m is Obstruction Kernel of Type F, which implies this case cannot occur.

iii)ϕ(1) is multiplication by 2k−1 + 1, then G contains Z2k ⋊ϕ Z2, a 2-group.
This however contradicts the remark following Theorem 2 of [KS]. Thus this
case is impossible.

iv)ϕ(1) is multiplication by 2k−1 − 1. A same argument as above produces

a contradiction.

In all the possible cases above, G has to be isomorphic to a subgroup of
✷

O(3).

Remark 2 The proof actually shows that G is either Z2n, Zn ⊕ Z2 or D2n.

4 The Dihedral Case

The proof of the dihedral case follows the spirit of Proposition 8 and 9 in [KS].

3 such that the subgroup of orientation preserving

homeomorphisms is D2n, n odd, n > 3, then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of
O(3).

It suﬃce to consider the case where the action is not orientation pre-
Proof
serving. The ﬁrst half of the proof of Proposition 8 of [KS] carries verbatim.
We have two cases(notations are borrowed from that proof):

Case 1: If (2a1, 2a2, . . . , 2an) = (0, 0, . . . , 0)
In this case the short exact sequence

0 −→ D2n −→ G −→ Z2 −→ 0

splits and thus G ∼= D2n ⋊ϕ Z2, ϕ as deﬁned in Proposition 8 of [KS].

We have bi = ±1 for all i. There are three subcases:
i) Both ±1 appears. In this case G contains an Obstruction Kernel of Type

A, which is impossible.

ii) bi = 1 for all i. then the action ϕ is trivial on the cyclic subgroup Zn.
ϕ is always trivial on the period 2 generator b of D2n by deﬁnition. Thus ϕ is
trivial and G ∼= D2n × Z2, a subgroup of O(3).

iii) bi = −1 for all i, in this case G has been computed to be dihedral.

Case 2: if (2a1, 2a2, . . . , 2an) = (cid:0) p1−1

In this case G(as computed in [KS]) contains an Obstruction Kernel of Type

D, which is a contradiction.

Summing the above results, we see in all possible cases G ⊆ O(3).

✷

3 such that the subgroup of orientation
Proposition 7 Suppose G acts on R
preserving homeomorphisms is D2n, n even. If n > 2, then the extension 0 →
D2n → G → Z2 → 0 has to split.

Proof Assume this is not the case.

Take the Sylow 2-subgroup of D2n. It must be a copy of D2l+1. Let P be
the Sylow 2-subgroup of G containing this D2l+1. As a two group, P ⊆ O(3),
whence it is either Z2l+2 , Z2l+1 ⊕ Z2, D2l+2 or D2l+1 × Z2. Containing D2l+1,
P is not cyclic. It cannot be D2l+2 or D2l+1 × Z2 either since that would make
the extension 0 → D2n → G → Z2 → 0 splits (P − D2l+1 contains an element
of order 2). Thus P ∼= Z2l+1 ⊕ Z2. This group is cyclic, and the same has to be
true for D2l+1, whence l = 1. In other word, n = 2m, m odd.

It is not hard to compute that
∗
n where the embedding Zm ⊆ Zn is canonical.

We have seen that Aut D2n ∼= Zn ⋊ Z

∗
n.

Inn D2n = Zm ⋊ {±1} ⊆ Zn ⋊ Z
Thus Out D2n ∼= Zn ⋊ Z
∗
n/Zm ⋊ {±1}.

The exact sequence

0 −→ D2n −→ G −→ Z2 −→ 0

induces an abstract kernel φ : Z2 → Out D2n. φ(1) is represented by any
conjugation of an element of G − D2n on D2n.

Consider the subgroup {e, am, b, amb} ⊆ D2n where e stands for identity.
This is a copy of D4. Let P ′ be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G containing D4.
P ′ ∼= Z4 ⊕ Z2. In particular, P ′ is abelian. Take x ∈ P ′ − D4. the conjugation
∗
of x on D4 is trivial. Now x ∈ G − D2n. Let (t, s) ∈ Zn ⋊ Z
n = Aut D2n be the
conjugation by x. This automorphism sent b to atb. Thus t = 0 ∈ Zn. So φ(1)
can be represented by (0, s). φ(1)2 = 0 implies s2 = ±1 ∈ Z

Let (b1, . . . , bk) be the element in the rightmost group above corresponding to

Since D2n is centerless for n > 2, then (as computed in Proposition 8 of

[KS]) each abstract kernel corresponds to one and only one extension.

Case 1: If s2 = 1, then bi = ±1. Consider the homomorphism

ϕ : Z2 −→ Zn ⋊ Z

n = Aut D2n

where ϕ(1) = (0, s). The extension

induces the abstract kernel φ. By uniqueness this split extension is equivalent to
0 −→ D2n −→ G −→ Z2 −→ 0, contradicting to the non-splitting assumption.

0 −→ D2n −→ Zn ⋊f Z4 −→ Z2 −→ 0

induces the abstract kernel φ. By uniqueness G ∼= Zn ⋊f Z4. This however
contains an Obstruction Kernel of Type D, which is thus impossible.

In sum, either case leads to a contradiction and the assumption fails.

✷

3 such that the subgroup of orientation preserving
Theorem 5 If G acts on R
homeomorphisms is D2n, n even, then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of O(3).

If n = 2, then G is a 2-group and the result is known. So it suﬃce to

Proof
consider the case where n > 2.

Thus G ∼= D2n ⋊ϕ Z2 for some ϕ : Z2 −→ Aut D2n ∼= Zn ⋊ Z

By the preceding proposition, the extension 0 → D2n → G → Z2 → 0 splits.
∗
n. Let ϕ(1) = (t, s).
Consider the subgroup Zn ⋊ϕ Z2 ⊆ G. By Remark 2, this subgroup is
isomorphic to either Z2n, Zn ⊕ Z2 or D2n. Since n is even, Zn ⋊ϕ Z2 cannot be
cyclic. Thus there are two possibilities.

Case 1: Zn ⋊ϕ Z2 ∼= Zn ⊕ Z2
In this case s = 1. ϕ(1)2 = (t, 1)2 = (2t, 1) = (0, 1). Thus t = 0 or t = m,

m = n
2 .

i)If t = 0, then ϕ(1) = (0, 1), which is the identity isomorphism of D2n, thus

G = D2n × Z2.

ii)If t = m, then ϕ(1) = (m, 1). Consider the subgroup {e, am, b, amb} of
D2n. This is isomorphic to Z2 ⊕ Z2, and ϕ(1) restrict to an isomorphism of this
group. It is not hard to see the resulted (Z2 ⊕ Z2) ⋊ϕ Z2 is isomorphic to Q8.
But this is Obstruction Kernel of Type F, a contradiction.

Case 2: Zn ⋊ϕ Z2 ∼= D2n
In this case s = −1. We divide the discussion by parity of t.
i)If t is odd. Then G is dihedral as computed in Proposition 9 of [KS].
ii)If t is even. Let r = t

2 . The element (arb, 1) is of order 2, and (arb, 1) ∈
G − D2n. Thus G ∼= D2n ⋊φ Z2 where φ(1) is the conjugation by (arb, 1). An
easy computation shows that

(arb, 1) · (a, 0) · (arb, 1) = (a, 0)
(arb, 1) · (0, 1) · (arb, 1) = (0, 1)

Thus φ(1) is the identity and G ∼= D2n × Z2.

We have seen that in all possible cases, G ⊆ O(3).

✷

Remark 3 The last case in the proof actually gives an alternative proof to
Obstruction Kernel of Type 6 in [KS], since G then contains a copy of Z2 ⊕
Z2 ⊕ Z2, which is not allowed in the orientation preserving case.

Summing up the above results, we have:

Corollary 1 If G acts on R
homeomorphisms is dihedral, then G ⊆ O(3).

3 such that the subgroup of orientation preserving

5 The A4 Case

Theorem 6 If G acts on R
homeomorphisms is A4, then G ⊆ O(3).

3 such that the subgroup of orientation preserving

Proof There are up to isomorphism 15 groups of order 24, among which only
A4 × Z2 and S4 contains A4. Both are subgroup of O(3).
✷

6 The S4 Case

Theorem 7 If G acts on R
homeomorphisms is S4, then G ⊆ O(3).

3 such that the subgroup of orientation preserving

Proof The only extension of S4 by Z2 is S4 × Z2(cf. [KS]).

7 The A5 Case

Theorem 8 If G acts on R
homeomorphisms is A5, then G ⊆ O(3).

There is a subgroup of S5 isomorphic to GA(1, 5) ∼= Z5 ⋊ Z

suﬃce to prove that S5 cannot act on R
∗
5. This group
cannot be embedded in A5, thus the action restrict to an orientation reversing
one on it (alternatively one can use the proof in [KS] to show that this group
∗
cannot act orientation preservingly). There is only one subgroup in Z5 ⋊ Z
5
on index 2 and it is a copy of D10. This D10 then has to be the subgroup of
orientation preserving homeomorphisms.

By the dihedral case, Z5 ⋊ Z

It is not
abelian, thus has to be either D20 or D10 × Z2. Neither can be the case(the
former is discussed in [KS], while the latter can be done by comparing Sylow
2-subgroups). This contradicts with the assumption.
✷

5 has to be a subgroup of O(3).
