Abstract Many gaseous exoplanets in short-period orbits are on the verge or are in the
process of tidal disruption. Moreover, orbital stability analysis shows tides can drive many
hot Jupiters to spiral toward their host stars. Thus, the coupled processes of orbital evolution
and tidal disruption likely shape the observed distribution of close-in exoplanets and may
even be responsible for producing some of the short-period rocky planets. However, the
exact outcome for a disrupting planet depends on its internal response to mass loss, and
the accompanying orbital evolution can act to enhance or inhibit the disruption process.
In this study, we apply the fully-featured and robust Modules for Experiments in Stellar
Astrophysics (MESA) suite to model Roche-lobe overﬂow (RLO) of short-period gaseous
planets. We show that, although the detailed evolution may depend on several properties
of the planetary system, it is largely determined by the core mass of the disrupting gas
giant. In particular, we ﬁnd that the orbital expansion that accompanies RLO often stops
and reverses at a speciﬁc maximum period that depends on the core mass. We suggest that
RLO may often strand the remnant of a disrupted gas giant near this orbital period, which
provides an observational prediction that can corroborate the hypothesis that short-period
gas giants undergo RLO. We conduct a preliminary comparison of this prediction to the
observed population of small, short-period planets and ﬁnd some planets in orbits that may
be consistent with this picture. To the extent that we can establish some short-period planets
are indeed the remnants of disrupted gas giants, that population can elucidate the properties
of gas giant cores, the properties of which remain largely unconstrained.

1 Introduction

From wispy gas giants on the verge of tidal disruption1 to tiny rocky bodies already falling
apart, extrasolar (or exo-) planets with orbital periods of several days and less challenge
theories of planet formation and evolution. Although they are statistically rare, most current
survey techniques favor their detection, and the population of known short-period planets
has grown dramatically over the years. For example, among stars targeted by the Kepler
Mission, [22] estimated 3.4±0.3% of the GK dwarfs host planets with radii between 2 and
32 times the Earth’s REarth, and periods P < 10 days, while almost 30% of all Kepler’s
candidates lie within those ranges.

Figure 1 shows the radii Rp and orbital periods P of short-period planets and how close
they are to their Roche limits. [46] cast the classic Roche limit for a low-mass companion as

a period PRoche that only depends on a planet’s density r p: PRoche = PRoche,0(cid:0)1 g cm−3/r p(cid:1)1/2.

For planets comprised of highly compressible ﬂuid, PRoche,0 = 9.6 hours, while for plan-

removing its atmosphere.

ets comprised of incompressible ﬂuid with negligible bulk tensile strength, PRoche,0 = 12.6
hours. The x-axis of Figure 1 assumes PRoche,0 = 9.6 hours for all planets. [46] explored
deviations from the simple PRoche expression used here.

The distribution of orbits for hot Jupiters extends to very near the planets’ Roche limits,
indicating that at least some hot Jupiters are on the verge of tidal disruption. Others may
actually be in the process of disruption. For example, [28] pointed out that WASP-12 b, a
hot Jupiter in a 19-hour orbit, may be undergoing disruption since its hot atmosphere likely
extends up to planet’s Roche lobe, even though the photosphere does not.

Since the vast majority of short-period planets have circular orbits and probably syn-
chronized rotation, tides raised on the planets by the stars have no effect on the orbital
evolution, but for stars that are not tidally locked to their planets, tides raised on the stars by
the planets can drive orbital evolution, long after eccentricities drop to zero. In cases where
the host star rotates more slowly than the planet revolves, tides raised on the star lag the
planet, and the resulting gravitational pull on the planet of this bulge reduces mechanical
energy and transfers angular momentum from the orbit to the star’s rotation, driving orbital
decay [16]. In fact, the vast majority of known planet-hosting stars rotate more slowly than
their close-in planetary companion and so fall into this category. An interesting exception
is the t Boo system, where the star may be tidally locked to the planet [55]. The HAT-P-
11 system is also noteworthy for a possible 6:1 commensurability between the orbital and
stellar rotation periods.

Energy and angular momentum considerations of tidal interaction indicate that many hot
Jupiters systems in circular orbits are formally unstable against tidal decay [10]. [27] pointed
out that most hot Jupiter systems known at that time have insufﬁcient angular momentum
to reach a stable tidal equilibrium, although more recently, [1] looked again and decided
that many, but not most, hot Jupiters are unstable. Thus, at least some fraction of hot Jupiter
systems will inevitably spiral toward their host stars.

Whether the systems will spiral inward in less than the main sequence lifetimes of the
host stars is not clear, however. The rate of in-spiral depends in part on the efﬁciency with
which tidal energy is dissipated within the host stars, often parameterized by an efﬁciency
parameter Q⋆, and the dissipation processes within stars that set Q⋆ are not well-understood.
Theoretical studies make a variety of predictions regarding the nature and efﬁciency of
tidal dissipation within stars. [14] predicts a rich but complex dependence of dissipation on
the tidal frequencies, and much work, including [42], suggests dissipation primarily occurs
within a star’s convective zone. Therefore, stars with deeper convective zones (i.e., cooler
stars) should exhibit greater tidal dissipation.

Estimates for effective Q⋆ derive from this wide body of work and range from 105 [30,
14] up to 109 and larger [41]. Larger Q⋆-values correspond to slower tidal evolution rates,
and assuming frequency-independence [21], this range of Q⋆ indicates tides would take
between 2 Myrs and 20 Gyrs to drive a Jupiter-like planet around a Sun-like star from a
period of 1 day to its Roche limit (∼ 8 hours).

We can appeal to additional observations for constraints on the degree of tidal evolu-
tion among short-period planets. [34] found that, among the many Kepler targets for which
rotation periods have been estimated, short-period planets are less commonly observed tran-
siting the most rapidly rotating stars. This observation is qualitatively consistent with the
idea that planets that have been accreted by their star via tidal decay deposited signiﬁcant
angular momentum in the host stars’ outer envelope, giving them unusually high rotation
rates [24].

[43] sought the signature of tidal interactions by comparing members of stellar binaries
in which one of the stars hosts a short-period planet and the other does not. They estimated

x-ray activity (which scales with stellar rotation rate) for several widely separated binary
stars and found that those stars with relatively deep convective zones exhibited enhanced
x-ray activity, and hence more rapid rotation, than expected based on the x-ray activity of
the partner stars without planets. [17] studied some of these systems and found that the
enhanced rotation rates for the planet-hosting stars pointed to substantial tidal decay of the
accompanying planets.

The period distribution of planets very close to their host stars may also point to non-
negligible tidal decay. Figure 2 plots the periods for many short-period planets against the
masses estimated for their host stars. Also shown as yellow lines are the periods correspond-
ing to the stellar surfaces at 3 and 10 Myrs after formation, as modeled by the Modules for
Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics suite (MESA) [39]. One hypothesis for the origins of
short-period planets involves migration while the planets are embedded within the proto-
planetary gas disk [8], and so that evolution must have occurred within the disk lifetime.
Disk lifetimes are thought to be less than 10 Myrs [4]. Many of the planets shown actu-
ally lie within the region occupied by their host star at such early times, which argues that
the planets arrived at their orbits long afterward. Late-stage tidal decay of their orbits is an
obvious explanation, although that evolution may have resulted from excitation of orbital
eccentricity by additional planets and tidal dissipation within the planet [53] and not within
the star.

Fig. 3 The blue circles represent the ratio of a planet’s orbital semi-major axis a to its Roche limit aRoche. The
horizontal blue lines shows the expected minimum ratio for planets having become close-in via circularization
of a highly eccentric orbit [18]. The data for this plot were harvested from exoplanets.org on 2015 Jul 8.

An alternative origin scenario involves the dynamical excitation of a planet’s orbital
eccentricity to values near unity, giving a planet formed in a more distant orbit a pericenter
distance close enough that tides can circularize and shrink the orbit [15,59]. The smallest
pericenter allowed for such a planet is its Roche limit, and so [18] pointed out that, since
tidal damping within the planet should nearly conserve the orbital angular momentum, the
smallest semi-major axis a at which the orbits would circularize is twice the planet’s Roche
limit. Using the same population as in Figure 2, Figure 3 shows each planet’s a and the semi-
major axis for its Roche limit aRoche. The vast majority of planets lie outside 2 × aRoche, but
a small cluster of the short-period planets actually lies within. If those planets originated in
the way described here, then their presence interior to 2 × aRoche can be explained by tidal
decay of their orbits subsequent to their arrival into short-period orbits.

This body of circumstantial evidence suggests at least some close-in exoplanets undergo
signiﬁcant orbital decay and eventually mass transfer to the host star once they encounter
their Roche limits, but what happens to the disrupting planets? How long does the disruption
process take, and are the remnants hidden amongst the currently observed population of
close-in planets? Do the remnants have physical or orbital properties that could distinguish
them?

As for binary star systems, the timescale of disruption and accompanying orbital evo-
lution depend very sensitively on the mass-radius relationship for the planets undergoing
disruption [45]. Recently, [52] and [51] applied state-of-the-art planetary mass-radius rela-
tionships to investigate the outcomes of mass transfer for hot Jupiter systems for a range of
assumptions about the details of the mass transfer. As we explain in Section 2, those stud-
ies found mass transfer can drive signiﬁcant orbital expansion for a planet overﬂowing its

6

Brian Jackson et al.

Roche lobe, often stranding a remnant planetary core in an orbital period of several days, far
from the Roche limit for the progenitor planet. The latter study also found an anti-correlation
between the remnant mass and orbital period and argued that many of the small planetary
objects recently discovered [49] in ultra-short periods (< 1 day) are too close-in to be the
remnants of disrupted hot Jupiters.

In this study, we re-visit the planetary mass transfer process, building on those previous
studies to explore the orbital periods expected for the remnants of disrupted hot Jupiters.
We also suggest that the remnants may appear as gas-rich super-Earth/sub-Neptunes with
orbital periods that depend sensitively on the mass of the planet’s solid core and with unusu-
ally low-density atmospheres. Our focus here is to develop speciﬁc theoretical predictions
that can then be compared in detail to observations. We make a preliminary attempt at this
comparison as well.

The plan for this paper is as follows: In Section 2, we review the dynamics of mass trans-
fer or Roche-lobe overﬂow, with approximations tailored for planetary systems. In Section
3, we present the results of a large suite of evolution calculations using MESA. In Section 4,
we explore a simple relationship between the core mass for a remnant and its orbital period
and compare that prediction to observations. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude and discuss
future work.

2 Dynamics of Planetary Roche-Lobe Overﬂow

In considering the dynamics of gas giants undergoing RLO, we make several assumptions,
among which the most important are the following:

1. Mass transfer completely conserves angular momentum, in which case gas escaping the
planet forms a thin accretion disk around the star and rapidly transfers all of its angular
momentum back to the planet before falling onto the star.

2. The planet has a circular orbit with a mean motion larger than the host star’s rotational
frequency and the total angular momentum of the planet-star system lies below the criti-
cal threshold for tidal equilibrium. As a result, the tide raised on the star lags behind the
planet and tends to transfer angular momentum from the orbit to the stellar rotation, but
tides cannot synchronize the star’s rotation to the orbit.

With these assumptions, we follow a simpliﬁed version of the derivation described in
[45], along with some modiﬁcations speciﬁc to planet-star systems. The orbital angular mo-
mentum J is given approximately as

J ≈ MppGM⋆a,

(1)

where Mp is the planet’s mass, M⋆ the star’s mass, G Newton’s gravitational constant, and a
is the orbital semi-major axis. A change in angular momentum can arise from changes in a
or Mp (since Mp ≪ M⋆, we neglect changes to M⋆):

a(cid:19) = 2(cid:18) ˙J
(cid:18) ˙a

J(cid:19) − 2(cid:18) ˙Mp,RLO
Mp (cid:19) .

(2)

We consider Darwin’s model for tidal interaction and assume tidal dissipation can be
modeled with a frequency-independent efﬁciency parameter for the star Q⋆ into which we
have absorbed the stellar Love number [25]. There are many alternative formulations which

Tidal Decay and Disruption of Gaseous Exoplanets

involve more sophisticated assumptions about the nature of tidal dissipation and stellar in-
ternal structure (e.g., [13]), but using a different tidal model would modify the timescales for
dynamical evolution and not substantially alter our results. The tidal interaction is the only
process that signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the orbital angular momentum in the case of conservative
RLO, so

where R⋆ is the stellar radius.

In our scenario, a hot Jupiter has its orbit decay according to Equation 3 until it comes

into Roche-lobe contact, at which point

Rp = RRoche,

where RRoche is given by

RRoche = f(cid:0)Mp/M⋆(cid:1)1/3 a

and f (∼ 1) incorporates details of the planet’s internal structure and constitution (cf. [36]).
Since the escaping gas leaves the planet with some non-zero angular momentum, it can
form a thin accretion disk around the star. Torques between the planet and disk, along with
viscous dissipation within the disk, can act in the opposite direction as the torque from the
tide raised on the star. Mass loss would choke off if the planet were no longer ﬁlling its Roche
lobe, so the disk torque cannot push the planet outward of its Roche limit. At the same time,
if the tide raised on the host star were to drive the planet inward through its Roche limit, the
degree to which the planet overﬁlled its Roche lobe would increase, signiﬁcantly increasing
the rate of mass loss [48], the amount of mass in the accretion disk, and thus the strength of
the outward torque. Consequently, in the case of stable RLO, a balance develops between
the tidal and gas torques [44], and RRoche is held very nearly equal to Rp.

We can work out how the planet’s orbit evolves during RLO by differentiating Equation

4 and incorporating Equations 2 and 5:

(cid:18) ¶ lnRp

The ﬁrst term on the left-hand side of Equation 6 incorporates the change in radius due to
mass loss via RLO, while the second term involves any other change in radius.

Plugging in Equation 3 for ˙J/J and re-arranging gives expressions for the RLO mass

loss rate and the accompanying evolution of the semi-major axis:

MESA below. However, we can draw some qualitative conclusions regarding the evolution
without solving them directly by applying a few approximations.

8

Brian Jackson et al.

First, assume the ¶ Rp/¶ t terms in both equations are negligible – [2] calculated that,
at ages ≥ 1 Gyrs, hot Jupiters take Gyrs more for their radii to contract by ∼ 10%. Upon
encountering its Roche limit, a hot Jupiter will begin losing mass to the star, and whether the
orbit expands (da/dt > 0) or decays (da/dt < 0) depends on how (2h − 1) evolves. Setting
(2h − 1) = 0 and rearranging gives ¶ lnRp/¶ lnMp = 1/3. In other words, the evolution
of the orbit depends on the evolution of the planet’s density, as we might expect. For hot

Jupiters, in fact,(cid:0)¶ ln Rp/¶ lnMp(cid:1) ∼ 0 while Mp ∼ 1 MJup [19].

With these approximations, upon encountering its Roche limit, a hot Jupiter will begin
losing mass to the star, and its density will drop, which causes its Roche limit to move
outward. Consequently, the torques in the accretion disk should drive the planet outward,
which will follow the Roche limit very closely. At larger P (and/or smaller Mp), the inﬂuence
of tides raised on the star will decline, which will reduce the mass transfer rate.

As the hot Jupiter loses its atmosphere, eventually its core (if it has one) begins to dom-
inate its mass, and the density increases as mass is lost and the Roche limit can retreat
inward. If the tidal torque is sufﬁciently strong at that point, the remaining planet can follow
the Roche limit back in, and mass loss will continue until the planet encounters the stellar
surface, at which point, accretion of the planet may produce very bright optical and X-ray
transient signals [35].

If the initial orbital expansion drives the planet far enough out, the tidal torque may
become small enough that mass loss rate tapers off, as shown in Equation 7, which would
presumably leave the planet with a gaseous envelope. Radiative cooling dominates the time
evolution of Rp and gives ¶ lnRp/¶ t < 0, meaning that term only reduces the mass loss rate.
However, RLO is not the only process that removes planetary mass – short-period gas
giants are also prone to photoevaporative mass loss, in which heating of a planet’s upper
atmosphere by X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) drives a hydrodynamic outﬂow [54]. Several
studies, including [31], have shown that this evaporative mass loss can completely remove
the atmosphere from a Neptune/sub-Neptune-like planet but has little effect on the total mass
of a hot Jupiter.

[12] provided a useful parameterization for energy-limited evaporative mass loss ˙Mp,evap

incorporating the effect of tides:

˙Mp,evap = −

ep R3
pFXUV
GMpKtide

,

(9)

where FXUV is the stellar XUV ﬂux at the distance of the planet, which tends to fall off for
Sun-like stars as the stars age [47]. Rp is the planetary radius, and e is the fraction of incom-
ing XUV energy powering atmospheric escape, typically 10% [38]. Since gas outﬂowing
from a planet close to its host star only has to reach the Roche lobe to escape, the required
escape energy is smaller than if the gas had to escape to inﬁnity, and Ktide represents this
reduction in the escape energy, ranging from zero (a planet ﬁlling its Roche lobe) up to unity
(a planet very far from ﬁlling its Roche lobe).

Among other studies, [37] employed a detailed radiative and hydrodynamic model to
show that Equation 9 provides a reasonable approximation for the mass loss rate. However,
that model (and Equation 9) are predicated upon the assumption that the atmosphere at
the XUV photosphere is still gravitationally bound to the planet. Instead, in the case that a
planet ﬁlls its Roche lobe, the photosphere is not bound by deﬁnition, and the atmosphere
structure adjusts as mass loss sets in. In fact, Ktide in Equation 9 decreases without limit as
Rp → RRoche, and so the predicted ˙Mp,evap blows up. Thus, the nature of photoevaporative
mass loss is not clear for a planet in RLO.

Tidal Decay and Disruption of Gaseous Exoplanets

Indeed, RLO and evaporative mass loss are not two distinct processes occurring in iso-
lation from one another; rather, they are endmembers along a spectrum of atmospheric es-
cape. The former operates when a planet ﬁlls its Roche lobe, while the latter can operate
even when the planet is far from ﬁlling the Roche lobe (e.g., for Pluto in our solar system
– [57]). However, as pointed out in [48] and [29], since planetary (and stellar) atmospheres
do not terminate at a hard boundary but gradually taper off into space, RLO can operate
even if the base of a planet’s atmosphere is a few atmospheric scale heights from the Roche
lobe. The transition between RLO and evaporative mass loss probably plays an important in
sculpting the atmospheres of the remnants of disrupted hot Jupiters and will be explored in
future work. [51] did include photoevaporation in their models using Equation 9, but it is not
clear how that study circumvented the singularity during RLO. In the absence of a photoe-
vaporative mass loss model that clearly applies during RLO, we do not include evaporative
mass loss in our calculations.

Turning back to RLO and tidal interactions, all of this planetary evolution is taking place
in the presence of an evolving star, and, as we show below, the rate of stellar evolution may
exceed those of orbital evolution and mass transfer. In this case, we expect that, once dis-
ruption begins, the planet will continue losing mass until the star leaves the main sequence,
at which point a Sun-like star will enter the post-main sequence and may accrete the planet
during its bloated red giant phase [7].

Thus, we expect four distinct outcomes for close-in planets involving tidal decay and

disruption:

1. Little to No Tidal Decay: Tidal decay occurs slowly enough that the close-in planet does
not encounter its Roche limit during the main sequence lifetime of the host star. Very
likely such planets are accreted during the post-main sequence, but observational evi-
dence for this accretion among red giant stars, including unusually high spin rates and
Li content, is currently ambiguous [6].

2. Complete Disruption and Accretion: The planet does encounter its Roche limit and un-
dergoes mass transfer, but mass loss and the subsequent reduction in planetary density
do not move the Roche limit out very far, leaving the tidal torque and, consequently,
the mass loss at relatively large values. Thus, the planet may quickly lose its gaseous
envelope, and the remaining core will spiral into the star, all during the main sequence.
As discussed above, the large rotation rates for Kepler stars not seen to host close-in
planets [34] may provide evidence for this scenario.

3. Incomplete Disruption and Delayed Accretion: Mass transfer begins and moves the planet

far enough out that it is not completely accreted by the star during the main-sequence.
However, loss of the planet’s atmosphere and contraction of its radius occur slowly
enough that the Roche lobe does not retreat inward. Consequently, after the planet en-
counters the initial Roche limit, it remains there, shedding mass either through RLO or
photoevaporation. Planets evolving in this way should be found at their current Roche
limits, and the fact that such a population is not observed might argue this scenario
occurs rarely or not at all.

4. Complete Disruption and Delayed Accretion: This scenario is similar to the third sce-
nario above and distinct from the ﬁrst scenario in that accretion of the remnant planet
does not occur during the main sequence. During mass transfer, the planet’s density does
turn over, stranding the remnant at a maximum Roche limit period during its evolution,
PRoche,max. As we show in the next section, this maximum orbital period depends sen-
sitively on the core mass, which means that the period of a planet, whether gas-rich or

10

entirely solid, that is the remnant of a disrupted hot Jupiter will be largely determined
by the mass of its solid core.

It is not clear that gas giants always have solid cores, and recent work has suggested
that gas giants may even begin with solid cores but lose them through dissolution of the
core in the gaseous envelope [58]. Any of the above scenarios could still apply to the case
of a coreless gas giant, but, of course, complete removal of the atmosphere means removal
of the planet altogether. The mass-radius relation of a coreless gas giant would likely pro-
duce different orbital evolution than discussed here, but we do not explore that case in what
follows.

Which of these scenarios applies depends in fairly simple ways on the planet’s initial
mass and period, its core mass, and Q⋆, and the suite of simulations described in the next
section illustrates examples of each.

3 RLO Results from MESA

Figure 4 (a) illustrates the evolution for planets with a range of initial envelope masses
Menv,0 = [0.3, 1, 3] Jupiter masses MJup but all with the same core Mcore = 10 MEarth. In (b),
the planets all begin with the same Menv,0 = 1 MJup but with Mcore = [1, 5, 10, 30] MEarth. All
host stars have M⋆ = 1 MSun and Q⋆ = 105. All systems begin with initial periods P0 = 3 days
and evolve from 20 Myrs to 10 Gyrs after formation. We assume solar metallicity for the star
and the planet’s atmosphere. Irradiation from the star is deposited within the planet’s atmo-
sphere at a ﬁxed column depth, 100 g/cm2, as in [51]. We use the “implicit” RLO mass loss
scheme in MESA. The host star sheds angular momentum through a rotationally-enhanced
wind, as described in [40], and we hold the stellar radius ﬁxed throughout the evolution. A
consequence of this latter assumption is that we may underestimate the tidal torque, espe-
cially as the star leaves the main sequence and expands. Additional model details are given
in our MESA “inlists” and results ﬁles, all available at http://www.astrojack.com/research.
Although the planets in (a) begin with a range of initial masses and encounter the Roche
limit at different times, the evolutionary curves all converge at late times because ˙a/a and
˙Mp/Mp both depend on ˙J, which scales with Mp. Thus, the planets with larger Menv,0 expe-
rience more rapid mass loss and orbit evolution, which eventually slow down as Mp drops,
allowing the planets with smaller initial masses to catch up.

Moreover, by late times (t & 5 Gyrs), the planets have lost sufﬁcient mass that they
have evolved from hot Jupiters, with envelope mass fractions fenv = Menv/Mp ∼ 1, to super-
Earths/sub-Neptunes, with fenv ≤ 0.5. [32] showed that the radii of such planets are almost
entirely determined by the value of fenv. Mass transfer of a planet’s gaseous envelope re-
duces fenv, so, as the fenv-values converge, the planets’ densities and Roche limits converge.
Figure 4 (b) drives home the key role played by Mcore in determining the evolution. For
the planets with Mcore ≤ 10 MEarth, mass transfer reduces the planetary densities to small
values, driving the Roche limit and the planets back out to P = 3 days before the simulations
end. In panel (b), those planets with Mcore ≤ 10 MEarth do not shed their entire envelopes
during the course of the simulation because the orbital expansion that accompanies the mass
transfer signiﬁcantly reduces ˙J.

Figure 5 demonstrates a wide range of evolution for a grid of Menv,0 and Mcore. (We en-
countered insoluable convergence problems for the combination Menv,0 = 0.5 MJup/Mcore =
10 MEarth.) As shown Figure 4, the key parameter determining the degree of orbital expan-
sion is Mcore. For example, all planets with Mcore = 10 MEarth back out to P = 1.4 days

(before tumbling into their host stars). This result agrees with those of [51] for the same
core mass. Planets with less massive cores continuing moving back out toward P = 3 days
and do not shed their entire atmospheres during the 10-Gyr simulation. By contrast, planets
with Mcore ≥ 30 MEarth back out only a little or not at all with onset of mass transfer.

Since it helps determine the rate of angular momentum transfer, Q⋆ also factors into the
fate of the planet, and Figure 6 shows evolution curves similar to those in Figure 4 but for
Q⋆ = 106. In this case, none of the modeled planets in either panel (a) or (b) encounters
their Roche limits until much later than in Figure 4, and so by the end of the simulation, the
planets still retain substantial gaseous envelopes. The departure of the star from the main

sequence increases its luminosity, which strongly heats the planets’ remaining atmospheres,
driving the planets’ bulk densities to very small values and the Roche limits out. However,
even in this case, the evolution for all planets with a given core mass converge.

The upshot of these simulations is that a planet’s core mass can play a dominant role in
setting the orbital evolution of a disrupting planet. As long as mass transfer occurs quickly
enough that stellar evolution is not a factor, we expect that a planetary mass-radius relation-
ship that incorporates the dependence on core mass should allow us to predict at least the
period at which orbital expansion of a disrupting planet halts. If tidal decay ceased at that
point, such a mass-radius relation would indicate exactly where we could ﬁnd the remnant
of a disrupted gaseous planet, given the remnant’s mass (and density).

Unfortunately, comparing Figures 4 and 6, it seems that, for conservative mass trans-
fer, transfer rates large enough to nearly completely remove an atmosphere require tidal
decay rates ( ˙J) that produce rapid orbital decay of the remnant, destroying the evidence (the
“Complete Disruption and Accretion” scenario above).

Fig. 6 Similar to Figure 4, except that Q⋆ = 106. The x-axis also spans a different range.

Whether such a scenario commonly occurs is unclear since the appropriate values for
Q⋆ are unknown, and it is not clear the mass transfer is completely conservative, as assumed
here. As discussed above, it also seems plausible that some form of photoevaporative atmo-
spheric escape should contribute to the mass loss, although it is not obvious what form it
should take. Altogether, these uncertainties mean that the timescales for mass loss and tidal
decay are not clear.

If mass loss rapid enough to remove a hot Jupiter’s atmosphere requires rapid orbital de-
cay, then there is unlikely to remain an observable remnant. [51] investigated the effects of
stable but not entirely conservative mass transfer. In this case, not all of the accretion disk’s
angular momentum is returned to the planet, and so, in order to compensate, the mass trans-
fer rate is signiﬁcantly larger than in the completely conservative case in order to maintain
stability of the transfer. Consequently, a given angular momentum transfer rate can drive

14

Brian Jackson et al.

a larger mass transfer rate than we ﬁnd here and potentially leave behind a remnant to be
observed. Contribution of evaporative mass loss could also help remove the atmosphere.
In fact, [51] found that, after shedding their atmosphere, the remnants of some planets re-
mained at the maximum Roche limit period that occurred during their evolution, PRoche,max,
at least when tidal decay rates were slow enough.

Thus, we suggest that, assuming there is some remnant left behind at all, the mass loss
and angular momentum transfer timescales are of secondary importance in determining the
properties and orbit of the remnant. Instead, we suggest that the mass-radius relationship
dominates, and we expect to ﬁnd remnants stranded near PRoche,max, the point at which the
tidal interaction becomes weakest.

A key feature of this hypthothesis is that, in order to denude a gas planet’s solid core, loss
of the atmosphere must continue, even as the Roche limit retreats inward of the planet’s orbit.
Since, in principle, this retreat of the Roche limit means the planet is no longer in Roche-lobe
contact, RLO must taper off. However, at that point, we suggest photoevaporation can take
over and remove much of the remaining atmosphere to produce a planet that not currently
observed in or near RLO. Otherwise, a population of nearly overﬂowing planets should be
observed, and it is not – Figure 1.

Of course, our simulations here indicate more complicated evolution can occur, but in
the interest of providing a clear, testable prediction, we next consider how the Roche limit
evolves as the planet loses its gaseous envelope and whether there is evidence for a popula-
tion of low-mass, short-period planets near periods where we’d expect remnants.

4 Evolution of the Roche Limit for a Disrupting Gaseous Planet

Applying a full planetary evolution model, [32] studied the dependence of the radii of sub-
Neptunes/super-Earths (with Mp ≤ 20 MEarth) on the planets’ envelope and core masses,
stellar insolation, and age. They ﬁt the following series of power-laws to provide an analytic
mass-radius relation:

Rp ≈ 2.06 REarth (cid:18) Mp

MEarth(cid:19)−0.21(cid:18) fenv

5%(cid:19)0.59(cid:18) Fp

FEarth(cid:19)0.044(cid:18) age

5 Gyrs(cid:19)−0.18

+ Rcore , (10)

where Fp is the stellar insolation received by the planet. Equation 10 involves a num-
ber of approximations, including neglecting the contribution to Rp of a radiative outer at-
mosphere, which is usually small (0.1 REarth). The last term represents the radius of the
solid core, which is insensitive to the exact proportion of iron and rock and is given by

Figure 7 compares the mass-radius relationship given by Equation 10 to that given in
Figure 7 of [51] based on the RLO calculations for that paper. (It is important to note that
the power-law ﬁts in [32] were made only for Mp ≤ 20 MEarth, and the gray region in the
ﬁgure shows where we have extrapolated beyond that point.)

As indicated in [52], the age of a planet becomes less important in determining the
radius as the planets ages, and that study considers a ﬁducial age of 5 Gyrs, at which point
the radius is insensitive to the initial entropy assumed for the planet’s interior. Interestingly,
the radii for this ﬁducial age lie considerably below the radii given in [51] for planets in
RLO.

In fact, the reason for this disagreement is addressed in [52]: all other things being equal,
larger planets cool more slowly, owing to their larger volume to surface area ratio, and it

For the LF14 relations, we have assumed planetary ages of 5 Gyrs (dotted lines) and 30 Myrs (solid lines).
The color of a line corresponds to an assumed Mcore (as labeled), and the gray region shows where we have

seems that planets arriving at a given mass via RLO retain higher internal entropies than
planets born with that mass. Indeed, the entropies estimated by MESA for the convective
interiors of our modeled planets from the previous section at a given Mp and age do exceed
the corresponding entropies shown in Figure 4 of [52].

By using a ﬁducial age of 30 Myrs in Equation 10 instead (solid lines in Figure 7), we
can bring the radius estimates into reasonable agreement with those of [51], at least at the
lowest masses, which is the most important portion of the curve for determining PRoche,max.
(Other similar, ﬁducial ages give worse qualitative agreement between the curves.)

We can re-write Equation 10 using this new ﬁducial age of 30 Myrs. Since fenv drops
while Mcore remains constant during RLO, with Mp = Mcore/ (1 − fenv), it is worth re-casting
the equation in terms of those variables:

Rp ≈ 5.17 REarth(cid:18) Mcore

0.05(cid:19)0.59

(11)

Here we have assumed Fp = FEarth since the insolation has only a small effect on the radius.
With this mass-radius relation in hand, we can solve for planetary density and therefrom
for PRoche as functions of Mcore and fenv. As in [32], we can estimate fenv by assuming
Mp ≈ Mcore and, for planets with small fenv, we can compare their current orbital periods

Fig. 8 The copper-to-black, solid contours show density and PRoche based on the mass-radius relationship
Equation 10 from [32]. The leftmost number labeling each contour is the density in g/cm3 and the right-
most the corresponding PRoche in hours. The vertical blue, red, and green dashed lines show the core masses
estimated using Equation 11 for GJ 1214 b, Kepler-21 b, and Kepler-78 b, respectively. The contour corre-

to the PRoche,max expected for a given Mcore-value. Figure 8 shows contours of PRoche as a
function of Mcore and fenv and the Mcore-values for three example, short-period planets, GJ
1214 b [9], Kepler-21 b [23], and Kepler-78 b [50].

Using Figure 8, we can study the orbital evolution during RLO of a gaseous planet
and predict quantitatively in what orbit the orbital expansion should slow. For example,
consider a gas giant planet ( fenv ≈ 1) with Mcore = 30 MEarth ≈ 101.5 MEarth. With a density
like Jupiter’s, 1 g/cm3, such a planet would encounter its Roche limit at PRoche = 9 hours.
Overﬂow would begin, reducing fenv and driving the planet downward along constant Mcore
in the ﬁgure. The planet should eventually encounter the r p/PRoche = 0.25 g/cm3/19 hrs
contour. As fenv → 0.5 ≈ 10−0.3, that PRoche/r p contour turns over, r p increases while PRoche
decreases, and presumably the planet would either move back in toward to the star or would
be stranded near this PRoche,max = 19 hrs, eventually to shed the rest of its envelope via
photoevaporation. Thus, in this simple scenario, a planet with a known Mcore should have a
period near the inﬂection point in contour that passes nearest its Mcore-value. Based on the
contours in Figure 8, Figure 9 shows PRoche,max as a function of Mcore.

To make that comparison for known planets, consider ﬁrst Kepler-78 b, represented by
the green, dotted lines in Figure 8. With P = 8.5 hrs, Kepler-78 b has a mass (1.69 MEarth)
and radius (1.20 REarth) consistent with a bare, rocky planet, i.e. Mcore = 1.69 MEarth. The
inﬂection point in the green, dotted contour in Figure 8 suggests such a small orbital period

would require a gas giant with Mcore > 100 MEarth, much larger than Kepler-78 b’s current
mass. Conversely, if it were the remnant of a disrupted gaseous planet, we would expect
Kepler-78 b to have a period nearer to 150 hrs, much larger than observed. In principle, tidal
decay of the core could reduce the orbital period, but moving from 150 to 8.5 hrs even with
Q⋆ = 105 would require 1.3 trillion years, and Q⋆-values small enough to do the job in a
short enough time would give the planet a pending lifetime short enough to be statistically
unlikely. This result is consistent with [51], which suggested that Kepler-78 b, like many
other ultra-short period planets [49], are too close-in to be remnants of disrupted gas giants.
Another illustrative case is GJ 1214 b, with P = 37.92 hrs. Based on its mass (6.46
MEarth) and radius (2.67 REarth), [32] estimate fenv = 3.83%. (Considering a different ﬁducial
age does not signiﬁcantly modify this value.) The inﬂection point for the PRoche = 37.92 hrs
contour lies near Mcore = 10 MEarth, slightly larger than GJ 1214 b’s core mass. Said another
way, the remnant of a gas giant with a core having GJ 1214 b’s core mass would be expected
near P = 55.6 hrs, farther out than GJ 1214 b is observed. Again, though, tidal decay of
the remnant’s orbit could explain the discrepancy, but with its current mass and Q⋆ = 105,
moving GJ 1214 b from 55.6 to 39.92 hours would require more than 60 Gyrs. A smaller
Q⋆ = 104 would bring the decay timescale down to a value closer to the system’s current
age (6 Gyrs) and would leave almost 1.5 Gyrs before the planet decayed down to its current
Roche limit at PRoche = 7 hrs. As an M-dwarf, GJ 1214 is expected to have a deep convective
zone, but it is not clear that such small tidal dissipation parameter obtains even in the case
of an M-dwarf.

Finally, consider Kepler-21 b, with P = 66 hrs. Based on its mass (3.85 MEarth) and
radius (1.64 REarth), we estimate its fenv ≤ 0.04%. Turning to Figures 8 and 9, we see that

core mass puts the planet not too far from its expected period, 82 hrs. In fact, tidal decay
with the planet’s current mass and Q⋆ = 105 can the planet from 82 to 66 hrs in about 2
Gyrs, leaving 1.4 Gyrs before the planet encounters its current Roche limit at 4.4 hrs. The
system’s age is not known, but these timescales are qualitatively consistent with our intuitive
expectations that we should not have caught the system in a short-lived phase of its life.

Figure 10 compares the observed orbital periods for close-in planets to our estimates of
their PRoche,max-values, shown as blue circles, and we’ve also considered the estimates of fenv
and Mcore from [32]. Here we’ve only considered those planets with estimated fenv ≤ 0.1,
but we have included planets that are observed to have sibling planets, indicated with black
circles. It’s not clear that the multiplanet system would remain dynamically stable with one
of the planets undergoing RLO, but considering that issue is outside the scope of this paper.
Figure 10 does not show a clear clustering of planets along the P = PRoche,max line,
but several objects lie nearby, qualitatively consistent with the RLO picture outlined here.
Interestingly, the planet lying nearest the line, the most promising candidate remnant, is
Kepler-93 b, with the most precisely measured exoplanet radius [3]. The majority of objects
depicted lie above the line, however, and for those planets to be remnants of disrupted gas
giants, our model would have to signiﬁcantly underestimate the radii, i.e. overestimate the
planetary densities. Some of the objects also lie well below the line, including Kepler-78
b (the red dot near PRoche,max = 6 days) and might require implausibly small Q⋆-values to
be consistent with the RLO models presented here. A more detailed analysis, tailored to

individual systems and incorporating observational biases would clarify the origins of these
objects but is beyond the scope of this study. (An interactive version of Figure 10 is available
at http://www.astrojack.com/research.)

5 Discussion and Conclusions

By investigating the evolution of bulk density for a disrupting gas giant, we have constructed
a simple model of orbital evolution during Roche lobe overﬂow (RLO) and sought remnant
cores amongst the observed population of short-period planets. We have conﬁrmed the re-
sults of [51] that the degree of orbital expansion accompanying RLO is directly related to the
mass of remaining planet. We have also expanded those results to argue that the core mass
of the disrupting gas giant dominates the maximum orbital period reached during RLO,
with the initial planetary mass, orbit, and the rates of orbital evolution and mass transfer
playing important but secondary roles. This approach has the beneﬁt of providing speciﬁc
observational predictions.

As useful as our analysis here may be, it involves several important approximations
and assumptions. For instance, we have assumed completely conservative mass transfer,
meaning orbital angular momentum is conserved during RLO. This assumption allows us
to circumvent the unknown tidal dissipation parameters Q⋆ and the efﬁciency for angular
momentum transfer between the disrupting planet and the accretion disk but means we have
neglected the effect of the related timescales, which can important. Fortunately, the maxi-
mum orbital period reached by a disrupting gas giant should not depend on the mass transfer
rate itself, but only on the planet’s mass-radius relation (assuming the transfer is stable), as
evidenced by agreement between our results in Section 3 and those in [51], which used a
different tidal interaction formulation.

In all our modeling here, we have assumed a solar metallicity for the atmospheres. En-
hanced metallicity can reduce the radius for a given mass, but the resulting enhanced at-
mospheric opacity can also slow the internal cooling of the planet, resulting in a slightly
inﬂated radius at a given age [5]. We leave an exploration of metallicity’s role on RLO for
future work.

We have also not explicitly included the photoevaporative mass loss, which may be a
key process in reducing the Neptune/sub-Neptune remnant of a nearly disrupted hot Jupiter
to a completely denuded solid core. As discussed in Section 2, models for this process have
been developed previously, but those models may only be applicable when a planet is not in
Roche-lobe contact. However, the details of this transition probably does not signiﬁcantly
modify the orbital evolution considered here.

Our modeling suggests four distinct scenarios for disrupting gas giants (Section 2): (1)
Little to No Tidal Decay, for which the currently observed properties of short-period planets
essentially reﬂects their initial conditions; (2) Complete Disruption and Accretion, for which
tidal disruption and decay would very quickly remove short-period planets, masking much
of the observational evidence for the process; (3) Incompletely Disruption and Delayed Ac-
cretion, in which case tidal disruption proceeds relatively slowly and would leave behind
gas-rich planets at their current Roche limits, a population not obvious among the observed
planets (Figure 1); and (4) Complete Disruption and Delayed Accretion, for which mass
transfer removes the atmosphere of a hot Jupiter but leaves behind a denuded or slightly
gas-rich remnant near the maximum Roche limit attained during RLO, a population which
is hinted at among the observed population (Figure 10).

Additional work is clearly needed to investigate the likely complicated transition be-
tween the endmember cases of RLO and photoevaporation to understand its inﬂuence on
Neptunes/sub-Neptunes. RLO models tailored to individual observed systems may also
prove fruitful and lend additional credence to the evolution discussed here. A better un-
derstanding of how short-period planets become short-period in the ﬁrst place would also
signiﬁcantly help clarify the extent to which subsequent RLO played a role since distin-
guishing remnants of RLO from those that superﬁcially resemble remnants is difﬁcult. Our
work here also provides additional impetus to better understand the mass-radius relation-
ship for the puzzling population of sub-Neptunes/super-Earths that seem so common in the
Milky Way [33].

If additional work can show that many small, short-period planets are the remnants of
disrupted gas giants, they can provide unprecedented insight in the natures of gas giant cores.
For instance, the threshold core mass required to initiate gravitational accretion of a gas giant
is probably & 10 MEarth [26] but remains poorly constrained by observation. Even among
gas giants in our own solar system, estimates of the core masses for Jupiter and Saturn
span a wide range – Jupiter may not even have a solid core [20] – but the upcoming Juno
mission will clarify the situation, at least for our solar system. Whether these constraints
will directly bear on other planetary systems is unclear since these other systems likely had
different formation conditions.

One issue not explored here is the inﬂuence of stellar properties. Since the tidal inter-
action strength depends very sensitively on stellar radius (we only considered solar mass
stars here), we would expect RLO of hot Jupiters to be more common for larger stars, all
other things being equal. Of course, all other things are not equal, and the occurrence rate
and initial conditions for hot Jupiters for different stellar types should both play key roles.
The occurrence rate of RLO remnant planets should depend on the occurrence rates of hot
Jupiters, but the dependence of that latter rate on stellar properties is poorly known [56]. By
contrast, [11] reported that the occurrence rate for Earth-size (0.5-1.4 REarth) planets with
orbital periods shorter than 50 days is constant among cool (T < 4,000 K) stars, while the
same occurrence rate for 1.4-4 REarth planets declines at cooler temperatures. Exploring all
these issues in the context of the RLO hypothesis may prove fruitful.
