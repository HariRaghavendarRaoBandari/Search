(Dated: March 10, 2016)

By combining DFT-based computational analysis and symmetry constraints in terms of group-
subgroup relations, we analysed the formation of the native crystalline structure of loellingite FeAs2.
We showed that the ground state of the material exhibits the ordered patterns of the electronic
−y2 orbitals and can be characterized in
localization which are mainly associated with iron 3dx2
terms of nematic-like ordering. The ordering is the result of the close interplay of the lattice and
the electron degrees of freedom. In a structural aspect, it pursues an energy quest to select the
orthorhombic crystal lattice attributed to the P nnm space group. In a charge aspect, the ordering
is connected with the valence charge density redistribution that not only provides a high electronic
polarizability but also gives rise to an extra-large magnitude of the negative component of the
dynamical p-d charge transfer.

INTRODUCTION

The structural integrity of a bulk solid containing a transition metal (TM) element with an open 3d-shell is governed
by a mutual balance of the driving chemical interactions. In this aspect, the direct charge transfer, the overlap of
the outer orbitals, and the many-body eﬀects of electronic correlations appear to be the most signiﬁcant structure-
dependent factors. On the other hand, the cooperative character of chemical bonding in the periodic lattice determines
the activity of these interactions upon a wide range of length-scales. The eﬀects of electronic correlations plays a very
important role because they tend to keep an atomic format of partially ﬁlled 3d states. This factor causes charge
localization on short-range scales and thereby gives extra opportunities for valence electrons to aﬀect the underlying
chemical structure, crystal packing geometry, and electron sharing possibilities.

Thus, the ﬂexible theoretical characterization of the crystal design of a compound with a 3d TM element should
greatly depend on an understanding of how the typical properties of structural geometry of the solid state may be
inﬂuenced by the features of spatial localization patterns of valence electrons. In the article, using the pnictide FeAs2
as a model example of a binary TM-nonmetal alloy we ascertain how the interplay between lattice stabilization and
valence electron localization sets up interesting peculiarities of the crystal chemistry of this material. To gain full
insight, we investigated the electronic properties caused by the 3d electrons of Fe cations in terms of possible structural
transformations driven by a TM-ligand coordination. Based on the obtained results, we found that the formation
of a preferred architecture of FeAs2 is accompanied by the further utilization of Fe−Fe planar interactions with the
establishment of nematic-like ordering.

II. MATERIAL, METHODS AND SIMULATION DETAILS

Loellingite belongs to a family of binary compounds (called pnictides) that contain a combination of a TM with
the ligands consisting of Group 15 elements such as P, As, Sb, and Bi.1 The orthorhombic structure of FeAs2 is
characterized by the space group P nnm (compressed marcasite phase) with lattice parameters a=5.3012 ˚A, b=5.9858
˚A, c=2.8822 ˚A.2 A study of the Fe−As phase diagram showed3 that FeAs2 retains stability up to its melting point at
1020◦ C. The insulating nature of FeAs2 was observed in resistance measurements4 performed for a single crystal at
ambient temperatures. An estimate of the band gap made from an analysis of the experimental resistivity ρ behavior
vs. T in terms of logρ indicated a value of about 0.22 eV. Computational studies of the electronic structure of FeAs2
provided information on the main features of electron bonds.5

To gain a deeper insight into the characteristic details of 3d iron (and 4p arsenic orbitals) and to understand the
structural factors markedly aﬀecting the electron localization in FeAs2, we analyzed the ground state by employing
DFT+U theory6 and the G0W0 approximation7, with an emphasis on determining the role the coordination environ-
ment plays in the genesis of the electronic subsystem. We performed spin-polarized periodic calculations using the
Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)8 together with the potential projector augmented-wave (PAW) method.9
As iron belongs to the category of ﬁrst-row late transition metal elements with localizable d orbitals, we determined

2

the Kohn-Sham (KS) eigenstates within the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) GGA exchange-correlation functional10
augmented with the Hubbard U term. The approach of Dudarev et al.11 has been used for PBE+U calculations.
The eﬀective value of the on-site d-d Coulomb repulsion, which represents the diﬀerence of the intra-atomic (U ) and
exchange (J) contributions Uef f = U − J, was estimated via constrained PBE calculations based on linear response
theory.12 We found that an average Uef f of 1.6 eV can be applied to take into account electron correlations in the
description of the FeAs2 ground state. In accordance with experiment,2 our calculations reproduced a nonmagnetic
ground state. The topological features of the valence electron distributions were investigated on the base of the theo-
retical charge densities; a grid-based Bader analysis post-processing method,13 which implements the AIM (”atoms in
molecules”) approach14 and the electron localization function (ELF)15 have been employed. The many-body polar-
ization eﬀects were characterized in terms of the Born dynamical charges;16 these charges were calculated within the
scheme of density functional perturbation theory.17 Analysis of the structural properties was performed by using the
programs FINDSYM of the ISOTROPY Software Suite18 and VESTA.19 For visualizations of the structures and elec-
tron topologies, we applied the VESTA program. Group-subgroup sequences forming the B¨arnighausen tree20 were
found by using the programs INDEX and SUBGROUPGRAPH21 hosted by the Bilbao Crystallographic Server.22,23
A plane-wave basis set with a 500 eV cutoﬀ and a Γ point centered mesh for the k-point sampling have been chosen
in our calculations. For cell and atom relaxations and stability analysis, k-grid sampling was taken as 6 × 6 × 8. G0W0
calculations employed a 6 × 6 × 10 k-point grid. The details of the electronic structure were investigated at a denser
8 × 8 × 12 k-point grid. The tetrahedron method with Bl¨ochl corrections24 was used for Brillouin zone integrations.
Zone centered vibrational modes and elastic moduli were obtained within the frameworks of the ﬁnite diﬀerences
method, as implemented in VASP.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Chemical content of structural formation of FeAs2

Although chemical considerations relate FeAs2 to intermetallic compounds/metalloids (like NiAs2), the material is
qualiﬁed as a low-gap semiconductor. Our DFT calculations have shown that the relatively small Hubbard energy
(Uef f ∼ 1.6 eV) related to iron 3d electrons does not favor the metal-dielectric transition. Note also that both
elements of the composition FeAs2 possess approximately similar values of the Pauling electronegativity (1.83 for Fe
and 2.18 for As). In this case, the mechanism of TM-ligand coordination, lattice structure stabilization and formation
of the band gap appears an open problem when viewed from the point of view of crystal design. To reveal the key
role the coordination environment plays in the genesis of the electronic structure, we considered the theoretical route
of the FeAs2 structural assembly. Starting from the chemical composition, we presumed that an assembly route of
FeAs2, written in terms of the chemical building blocks as

Fe + As−As −→ FeAs2,

represents a de novo process under which an array of As dimers is packed into the iron framework to arrange Fe−As
coordination. In a formal chemical context, the left part of this reaction corresponds to the starting mixture of the
reactants, which is used in practical work, for example, in the chemical vapor transport method to grow FeAs2 single
crystals.4 In our approach, we modeled a couple of As atoms in terms of an intermediate dimer to be placed in the
parent Fe lattice. We also assumed that the structural transformation passes the chemical content through the aﬃnity
property of rectangular lattices. This provides an optimization of atom sites via the regular scalability of the unit-cell
shape/volume coupled with the recasting of arsenic positions in the coordination environment.

By using the concept of an isotropy subgroup,20 we found the constraints for the structural transformations of the
system. In Fig. 1, the B¨arnighausen tree of possible structural relations for FeAs2 is given, from where we decided in
favor of the following set of allowed group-subgroup pairs: Im¯3m → I4/mmm → Immm → P nnm. Based on this
prediction, Fig. 2 shows the assembly route as a three-step pathway. Note that, prior to the ﬁrst step, we made a
tetragonal rebuilding of a single bcc iron lattice, Im¯3m → I4/mmm, via equal doubling of the cubic lattice period
a → 2 × 2.8274 ˚A in both longitudinal directions. This manipulation preformed a superstructure of Fe atoms as a
starting template qualiﬁed for the incorporation of arsenic dimers. Their initial packing arrangement proceeds by
placing them into a stacked disposition, followed by a small lengthening, 2.8274 → 2.8747 ˚A, of the lattice along the
tetragonal c direction. The ﬁrst step ends in the formation of a putative structure featured by an orthorhombic space
group Immm (labeled as Phase 0). Because such a trial conﬁguration turns out to be unstable, on the next step, As
atoms are further packed to lower the ground state energy. With respect to the geometry, the subsequent repacking
leads to the crossover from the I-lattice to the P -lattice and to the reduction in symmetry to the non-isomorphic
subgroup P nnm. Crystal stability is achieved in the coordination environment by rearrangements of the As atoms via

the As−As bonds elongation and rotation. This step forms the reﬁned intermediate conﬁguration (”hidden” phase
labeled as Phase I) associated with the conversion of the unfavorable arsenic ’4h’ sites to ’4g’ ones. In the ﬁnal step,
the native structure of FeAs2 (labeled as Phase II) is formed by a ”square-rectangular” transformation in the planar
sublattice of iron atoms. This transformation generates the diﬀerence of the in-plane lattice parameters but keeps the
same P nnm group.

brown (Fe) and green (As). The crystallographic data are given in Appendix (Table III). The packing of Phases 0, I, and II
is shown as a perspective c-axis plot. The common motif of all phases is a full matching of the Wyckoﬀ positions (’2a’ sites)
occupied by iron atoms. The assembly utilizes the arsenic dimer array, which is disposed along the c-axis by ﬁxation to the iron
z-coordinate after dissolving in the iron framework of the I4/mmm symmetry. The dimer-iron linkage occurs along one of the
lattice sides as the ”axial alignment” of As−As bonds. This determines the direction of the c-axis because of the Oh → D2h
reduction of the parent Im¯3m crystal symmetry and preassigns the smallest side, 2.8747 ˚A, of the unit cell. The diﬀerences of
the total energies between Phases 0 and I, and between Phases I and II are 448 kJ/mol and 54 kJ/mol, respectively.

We performed the mechanical stability tests for Phases I and II to be convinced that the strain energy of a crystal
is necessary positive. The corresponding elastic stability criteria,25 which make use of the matrices of the elastic
constants Cij, impose the following restrictions:

Once the matrix elements were determined (as shown in Fig. 3), it was found that each of the structures represented by
Phase I and Phase II satisﬁes the stability criteria. The results of the PBE+U calculations of the vibrational spectra
in harmonic approximation also validated that both structures pass the dynamical stability test (the corresponding
frequencies at the Γ point are presented in the Appendix). Furthermore, an analysis of the thermodynamical stability
of Phase I performed in terms of the heat of formation (∆H 0

f ) for the theoretical decomposition pathway

conﬁrmed that Phase I is stable with ∆H 0

nine independent elastic constants Cij in (GPa) were calculated using the PBE+U method.

To understand why Phase I suﬀers transformation into Phase II, we ﬁrst point out that they diﬀer in total energies
by 54 kJ/mol. The remarkable fact here is that these phases are closely related stable crystalline modiﬁcations of
FeAs2 and diﬀer mostly by the planar geometry of iron atoms. However, the intermediate Phase I is less stable
because an enhancement of the planar anisotropy through an in-plane stretching/contraction of the Fe−Fe distances
further lowers the ground state energy. In the stereochemical aspect, this result emphasizes that the reason why the
stable system undergoes 2D-planar reshaping is very unusual. The energy diﬀerence between Phases I and II is large,
whereas the corresponding change of the unit-cell volume is dramatically small (∼ 0.7%). We note further that the
shear (GV ) and bulk (BV ) moduli estimated in the Voigt approximation26 are larger than those of Phase I (Table
I). This fact, in terms of the upper bounds for the elastic moduli, represents a clear illustration of a hardening of

Table I: Shear modulus GV and bulk modulus BV in GPa for Phases I and II, estimated in the Voigt approximation26 from

the lattice due to the ”rectangular” structural reorganization in the subsystem of the iron atoms. The corresponding
reduction of Poisson’s ratio νV by ∼12% also indicates the enhancement of the lattice stability in Phase II. Thus, one
can conclude that, along with the lack of evidences of any lattice symmetry breaking, these facts give direct evidence
that the Phase I → Phase II transformation is entirely of an electronic origin.

In the context of how the eﬀect of the coordination environment guides the optimization strategy, we notice
that there is another symmetry-allowed group-subgroup pair Immm → Imm2 (instead of the P nnm subgroup

C. Polymorphism of FeAs2

as shown in Fig. 1) that suggests an alternate version of As atoms packing. A performed theoretical screening
predicted the possibility of a novel polymorph of FeAs2 with lattice parameters of a=5.425 ˚A, b=6.279 ˚A, and
c=2.976 ˚A. A Table IV of Appendix gives the set of calculated crystallographic data. The polymorph has an inverse
symmetry broken orthorhombic structure characterized by the polar space group Im2m. To analyze stability issues,
we calculated the elastic constants (the stiﬀness matrix is shown in Figure 3C) and the harmonic frequencies of the
zone centered vibrational modes (the values are displayed in the Appendix). We found that the Im2m structure fulﬁlls
the mechanical and dynamical stability tests. However, the diﬀerence in energy with respect to the native structure is
strongly positive, ∆Etot = 174 kJ/mol. Hence, the polymorph of the Im2m symmetry cannot be thermodynamically
stabilized under ambient conditions, and therefore, it is much less feasible than the experimentally observed geometry
of Phase II.

illustrative energy scheme of the eg doublet, showing the origin of the fundamental gap (∆) in the electron spectrum. Although
actual bonding and antibonding orbitals have some hybrid character caused by the light admixture of the As p states (Fig. 5A),
frontier Fe eg orbitals make the major contribution to an orbital character of the gap.

 

Figure 4 illustrates the diﬀerence of the arrangement of the FeAs6 polyhedra in the crystal structures of the
polymorph and the native phase of FeAs2. In both geometries, one can observe the void tunnels of keystone and

6

rhomboidal shapes, the edges of which are formed by corner-sharing FeAs6 polyhedra. Figure 4 also shows that just
in the structure of the polymorph, the tunnels determine the largest interstice space that may present a number
of preferential positions for the incorporation of dopant atoms. In the context of iron-based materials studies, this
interesting fact might allow us to consider the hypothetical FeAs2 of Im2m symmetry as a possible starting compound
for a theoretical design of new ternary iron pnictides.

D. Modeling of the structure-property connection

Figure 5 visualizes the respective changes in the electron subsystem of FeAs2 in terms of the partial densities of
states. Choosing bcc Fe as a reference point and recalling that the assembly is based on a superstructural architecture
derived from the bcc iron lattice, one would expect, in the context of a 3d-split conﬁguration, a replication of the
eﬀects of atomic-like Fe-3d states in the electron spectrum of FeAs2. It appears to be nearly so, regardless of the
p-d hybridization eﬀects inspired by the coordination of As ligands. A comparison shows that the orbital-selective
features of Fe in FeAs2, such as the hybridization character of a t2g manifold of states and stronger localization of eg
states (Fig. 5A), demonstrate the orbital properties similar to the α-Fe electronic structure.27 Furthermore, a small
pseudogap in the density of the states of Phase I means that the ligand ﬁeld strength is not yet suﬃcient to overcome
hybridization eﬀects and, hence, to completely exclude the system from the metallic range. However, as shown in
Fig. 5, a change of the orbital overlap caused by the transformation Phase I → Phase II leads to the conversion of
the pseudogap into a real forbidden gap of ∼ 0.4 eV. In contrast to octahedral complexes, this transformation forms
a certain electronic conﬁguration of Fe eg states, which corresponds to an insulating state of a orbital nature (as
depicted in Fig. 5B).

To conﬁrm the presented picture of the electron states, we compared the results of our PBE+U calculations with
those obtained within the G0W0 approximation. The G0W0 calculations resulted in a similar electron structure (see
the PDOS dependencies shown in Fig. 10 of the Appendix), and they reproduced the value of the dielectric gap very
close to that obtained by the PBE+U method.

We can further track how the bonding states of the dx2

−y2 symmetry underlie a particular charge ordering in the
orbital sector of FeAs2. As schematically illustrated in the upper half of Fig. 6, the Fe atoms occupy the corners of a
square with sides of length a in Phase I.

Figure 6: Characteristic patterns describing the genesis of the nematic ordering in Phase II in the orbital sector of |x2 − y2 >
functions that belong to the neighboring sites of the Fe sublattice. The net of equally spaced patterns can be imagined as being
formed by a projection of the P nnm lattice on the ab-plane. In the bottom half of the ﬁgure, the total energy diﬀerence with
respect to Phase I vs. the (normalized) planar deformation is graphed.

The orbital overlap generated by the functions |x2 − y2 > remains identical in both planar directions. Conversely,
in Phase II, where charge redistribution occurs, the full equality of the orbital overlaps between the x and y directions
becomes broken because of the planar tetragonal distortion. The distortion provides the minimization of the total
energy, as shown in the bottom half of Fig. 6. Based on the results of Refs.28–31, this implies that in the native
structure of FeAs2, there exists a electronic ordering of the orbital nematic origin. The nematicity scenario can be
described as follows:
(i) the electron-driven Phase I → Phase II modiﬁcation implies the transition to the nematic-like state in the subsystem

7

−y2 valence electron orbitals (so called orbital nematicity28,32).

of Fe 3dx2
(ii) in the geometrical context, the ordering is attended with a square → rectangular transformation, with the structural
distortion featured by the diﬀerence of the planar lattice parameters (b − a);
(iii) in the symmetry aspect, because of some freedom provided by the coordination environment eﬀect within the
dedicated orthorhombicity, the transition from Phase I to Phase II keeps all the operations of the space group P nnm
unchanged;
and (iv) in terms of the 2D internal lattice symmetry related to the ab-plane, the distortion can be formally associated
with the additional reduction of the local rotational symmetry from C4 to C2 with respect to the uniplanar neighboring
sites of the Fe sublattice. In addition, one can also emphasize that the charge aspect of the orbital nematicity is that
a spatial arrangement of the Fe 3dx2
−y2 orbitals induces charge ordering that can be characterized by the diﬀerence
of the overlap integrals between neighboring Fe dx2

−y2 states along the x- and y- planar directions.

E. Features of the bonding architecture: an interplay of the ordering and dynamic equilibration

To further highlight the eﬀect of coordination environment, we point out that the relevant σ- and π-interactions
driving the covalent binding of ligands to the TM form an inclined disposition of As−Fe−As building blocks in the
lattice. The corresponding structural motifs are shown in Fig. 7D.

Figure 7: Valence ELF distribution patterns with isosurfaces projected onto the (A) (1.5 0.75 1.2), (B) (−1.6 3.6 0), and (C)
(0.68 0.88 0) planes of the FeAs2 crystal structure. The visualizations were evaluated at ELF= 0.661. The numerical values of
the total charge partitioning, normalized between ELF= 0 and ELF= 0.8, are illustrated by the color scale between dark blue
and red, respectively. The lobe-like isosurface (in yellow) displayed near the As atoms corresponds to a lone pair domain. (D)
Schematic model view of the As−Fe−As building blocks in the FeAs2 lattice; the blocks possess a linear (D∞h) geometry and
consist of a central Fe2+ and two geminal As–. The color codes of atoms are the same as in Fig. 2.

From the aspect of dynamics the geometry of the As−Fe−As building block promotes promotes the interplay
between interatomic motions and valence electronic states. To explore how this interplay arises, note that, in the
relatively low-symmetry insulators, possessing a high electronic polarizability, small variations in the spatial po-
sitions of atoms, such as vibrations, may alter the static bonding topology by involving additional displacement-
induced symmetry-allowed combinations of the frontier TM d and ligand p orbitals overlapping (dynamic p-d
hybridization).34,35 The results of our tests showed that dynamic redistribution of the valence charge density has
a pronounced eﬀect in FeAs2. The evidence can be seen in Table II and Figures 7A-7C and 8.

The ﬁrst observation is that the Born eﬀective charges of Table II are enormously anomalous as compared with the
formal ionic charges of the ligand-ﬁeld model. The second observation is based on the analysis of ELF. It displays
the peculiar role that p-type lone pairs play at the vibrational contact. These s2p4 pairs are localized and ordered
around the geminal As–. The stereochemical activity of the pair mostly has a dynamical character, i.e., it may beneﬁt
the local delocalization through the dynamical back bonding from the ligand lone-pair to the central Fe2+ 3d states.
The ”virtual” transfer of the lone pair promotes a iron-reductive (arsenic oxidative) coupling that brings them an
enhanced negative (positive) eﬀective charge (Table II). Interestingly, the similar eﬀect of ”virtual” presence of a lone
pair through electron-phonon coupling was considered for the Te-II phase.36 Because the ligands stay coordinated to
Fe at the vibrational contact, the reverse process is the donation 3d(Fe) → 4p(As) to restore the former localization of
the lone-pair. Both processes driven by proper IR-active optical vibrations are therefore dynamically strung together
by the underlying (static) bonding architecture. Thus, the strong symmetry-allowed vibrational contacts of the p
and d orbitals mediate in FeAs2 the excess negative charge-ﬂow from the ligands onto the metal and back. This
can be referred to as the dynamic component of the net charge-transfer, extra-large in magnitude but opposite in
sign. Moreover, in the sense of dynamics, the back-bonding phenomenon correlates well with the fact that the Bader
eﬀective charges calculated for Fe and As have almost zero indicative values. This result simply indicates that, in the
sector of the dominating covalency, ”external” forcing such as the accompanying vibrations can be responsible for the
additional charge asymmetry.

In the context of such an eﬀect of dynamic equilibration, it is interesting to note that a similar situation characterized
by the importance of polarization eﬀects in the direct interaction of ligands lone pairs with the metal exists in Zn(II)
complexes.37

IV. CONCLUSION

In the present work, we performed a DFT-based analysis of the structural chemistry of the binary pnictide FeAs2.
We showed how the electronic features caused by the behavior of the 3d electrons of a TM can be understood in
terms of the investigation of the structural trends driven by TM-ligand interactions and the synthetic construction of
a preferred architecture accompanied by using Fe−Fe bonds. Starting from a known chemical composition and having
made the proper choice of symmetry constraints as an integral part of the assembling strategy, we reproduced the
native architecture of the loellingite from ﬁrst-principles. Wr also considered, for the ﬁrst time, two original electronic
properties of FeAs2, a nematic-like ordering in the subsystem of Fe 3dx2
−y2 valence electron orbitals and an extra-large
dynamic charge-transfer caused by a lone-pair conﬁguration. The ordering results from the design-imposed structural
adjustment of iron planar positions, whereas the negative dynamic charge-transfer employs the dynamical lability

9

of the Fe−As interactions in the covalent framework. The nematic ordering represents a macroscopic cooperative
phenomenon in the electron subsystem of FeAs2.
In a sense of crystal chemistry, this is a manifestation of the
structure-property relationship because the electronic topological eﬀect is directly driven by the lattice degrees of
freedom via the diﬀerence of the planar arrangements of the Fe atoms.

The interplay between the metallicity and covalence, which is a constructional feature of the FeAs2 crystal design,
may be responsible for a certain softness of the Fe−As covalent bonds. In this context, some interesting parallels with
the general design principles of dynamic covalent chemistry38 could be suggested. A tetragonally distorted form of bcc
iron involved in the three-step formation pattern of FeAs2 (Fig. 2) serves as a predesigned bulk superstructure that
functions as a template to distribute ligands in the condensed phase. Preferential binding between the Fe centers and
As ligands, which corresponds to the so-called ”covalent capture”, makes the structural motif of the template a basic
part of all possible structures (including the native one) contained in the formation route. The distribution proceeds
through a sequential ”proof-reading” generation of two intermediate geometries because the metallic bonding of the
template scales formation of covalent bonds by searching for the global minimum. The last structural correction
takes place largely inside of the template and deals with the utilization of Fe−Fe bonds to provide the state with
a nematic ordering. The coordination environment eﬀect is that the corresponding coordination and stabilization
processes place As atoms into favorable positions. On the other hand, the covalent capture maintains the usual labile
character of Fe−As ligand interactions. Thus, the coupling of two eﬀects, the coordination environment and dynamic
equilibration, through the assembly of the most dynamically stable structure of FeAs2 is another interesting fact in
the context of the close interplay of the lattice and the electron degrees of freedom in this material.
