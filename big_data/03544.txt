The run-and-tumble walk, consisting in randomly reoriented ballistic excursions, models phenom-
ena ranging from gas kinetics to bacteria motility. We evaluate the mean time required for this walk
to ﬁnd a ﬁxed target within a 2D or 3D spherical conﬁnement. We ﬁnd that the mean search time
admits a minimum as a function of the mean run duration for various types of boundary conditions
and run duration distributions (exponential, power-law, deterministic). Our result stands in sharp
contrast to the pure ballistic motion, which is predicted to be the optimal search strategy in the
case of Poisson distributed targets.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Run-and-tumble walks (RTW) are usually deﬁned as
randomly reoriented ballistic excursions – or runs – of
constant speed in Rd. Historically, such processes where
introduced to model the dynamics of particles in scatter-
ing environments, such as the motion of atoms in a gas
[1, 2] or electrons in a metal [3–5], as well as the scatter-
ing of light or neutrons [6, 7]. RTWs raised a renewed
interest more recently as it was realized that they provide
a minimal model of self-propelled particle dynamics [8],
notoriously exempliﬁed by swimming bacteria [9]. Their
range of applications has since then been extended from
the microscopic scale, as is the case of molecular motors
[10], to the cellular scale [11] or the macroscopic scale in
the case of animal behavior [12, 13].

In the context of living agents, it is usually hypothe-
sized that motion is aimed at fulﬁlling a biological func-
tion. A prototypical example of such function is the
search for targets – as is the case for immune system
cells looking for pathogens, or bacteria or larger organ-
isms looking for food [12, 13].
In these examples, the
optimization of the search eﬃciency, which appears as
essential, amounts to minimizing the search time for tar-
gets. In this context, L´evy walks – RTWs with power law
distributed run lengths – have been repeatedly invoked
as optimal foraging strategies [14]. This optimality how-
ever holds only in the particular case where the targets
are distributed in space according to a Poisson law, and
are in addition assumed to regenerate at the same loca-
tion after a ﬁnite time. In the opposite case of destruc-
tive search, where each target can be found only once,
the search is optimized by the trivial ballistic excursion.
These restrictive conditions have weakened the robust-
ness of L´evy strategies and made their applicability to
ﬁeld data rather disputed over the years [15–18]. In this

context, assessing the search eﬃciency of general RTWs
– and in particular L´evy walks – in the basic setting of a
single target in a ﬁnite domain appears as a very impor-
tant issue that has remained unsettled so far: this is the
goal of this article.

From a technical point of view, a natural observable
to quantify the search eﬃciency is the mean ﬁrst-passage
time (MFPT) to a target. In the case of a single target
in a bounded domain – or equivalently regularly spaced
targets in inﬁnite space –, the full FPT statistics, and in
particular its mean, have been derived asymptotically for
Markovian scale invariant random walks [19–21] (see also
[22] for an extension to non-Markovian processes). While
these results apply in particular to Brownian particles
that are subject to thermal ﬂuctuations, most of mod-
els of self-propelled particles, and in particular RTWs,
are not scale invariant, and cross-over from a short time
ballistic scaling to a long time diﬀusive scaling. Despite
their extensive analysis in inﬁnite space [23], the study
of their FPT statistics in conﬁnement therefore calls for
new approaches. First steps in this direction were made
in Refs.
[28], where
the MFPT for lattice persistent random walks was stud-
ied. This however does not solve the case of RTWs, which
cannot be deﬁned as a continuous limit of lattice walks
– a striking diﬀerence being that the MFPT for lattice
walks can be controlled by inﬁnitely long periodic orbits
[28], which do not exist for general domain shapes or
boundary conditions in continuous space.

[24–27], and more recently in Ref.

In this paper, we derive an accurate analytical ap-
proximate of the MFPT to a target of size a centered
in a spherical domain of radius b with various bound-
ary conditions, for RTWs with exponentially distributed
run lengths. Beyond the single target problem, this set-
ting eﬃciently approximates the destructive search of in-
ﬁnitely many regularly spaced targets with concentra-
tion ρ = 1/(πb2) (2D) or ρ = 3/(4πb3) (3D). We show
that the MFPT is minimized for a mean run duration
τ = τopt ∼ γb/ log(b/a), where γ is a constant that de-
pends both on the spatial dimension and the choice of
boundary conditions. However, the existence of the min-

imum is independent of the speciﬁc nature of the bound-
ary condition, which pleads for its robustness. In addi-
tion, we show that similar non trivial optima exist for
deterministic run durations (with respect to the run du-
ration τ ) and for power law distributed run durations
(with respect to the scale parameter τ of the power law),
i.e. L´evy walks. In sharp contrast with the case of Pois-
son distributed targets, these results highlight the crucial
role of the spatial distribution of targets in search prob-
lems, and put forward the robustness of optimal RTWs
for single target search problems.

II. EXPONENTIALLY DISTRIBUTED RUNS

We ﬁrst assume that the duration of each run is ex-
ponentially distributed with mean τ , which we call per-
sistence time. We denote by θ the angle between the
position vector r of the searcher and its velocity vector
v, the origin being the target center (see Fig. 1). At each
tumble, a new direction θ is set according to a uniform
distribution µ(θ) = 1/π in 2D and µ(θ) = sin(θ)/2 in 3D.
In 3D, the angle θ refers to the elevation angle of v with
respect to r. For symmetry reason the azimuthal angle φ
can be reset to 0 after each tumble event; hence the 3D
search problem with isotropic reorientations corresponds
to a 2D search problem with non-isotropic reorientations
characterized by µ(θ) = sin(θ)/2.

ble starting angles as (cid:104)t(cid:105) = (cid:82) π
ﬁned as the spatial average: (cid:10)t(cid:11) =(cid:82) b

The MFPT for a searcher starting at a distance r
from the target center with a velocity angle θ is denoted
t(r, θ). We deﬁne the averaged MFPT over all possi-
0 dµ(θ) t(r, θ); we will be
mainly interested in the global MFPT (GMFPT), de-
a dν(r) (cid:104)t(r)(cid:105), where
dν(r) = d rd−1dr/(b−a)d is the uniform spatial measure.
The MFPT can be shown to satisfy the following

integro-diﬀerential backward equation [29]:

v cos θ∂rt(r, θ) +

1
τ

dφ {t(r, φ) − t(r, θ)} = −1,

(1)

which admits a unique solution when completed by
boundary conditions. First, t(r = a, θ) = 0 for θ ∈
[π/2, π] as the process is stopped as soon as the searcher
crosses the target.
Secondly, we will consider three
types of conﬁning boundary at r = b: (i) the specular
boundary, which reﬂects incoming searcher according to
Descartes law, as a mirror would reﬂect a ray of light; (ii)
the scattering boundary, which scatters the searcher in a
random direction, with reinitialization of the run dura-
tion; (iii) the stubborn boundary, for which the searcher
waits for the next favorable reorientation to leave the
boundary. In the diﬀusive limit τ (cid:28) a/v, we expect to
have eﬀectively ∂r(cid:104)t(r)(cid:105) = 0 at r = b for any choice of
boundary condition. However, for arbitrary values of τ ,
deﬁning the appropriate boundary condition at r = b of
the MFPT is a challenging problem.

Analytical solutions of Eq. (1) are only available in
1D geometries, for which the orientation angle is either

towards the target will not cross it at any ulterior time. (b) In
3D. Due to the spherical symmetry, the search time does not
depend on the azimuthal angle φ between the velocity vector
v and the position vector r.

θ = 0 or θ = π. Following Refs. [29, 30], we ﬁnd that the
mean search time in the presence of a specular boundary

condition reads(cid:10)t(cid:11) = ((a − b)2(3D − (a − b)v))/(3bDv),

where D = v2τ . Mind that the latter expression predicts
that the GMFPT is a monotonically decreasing function
of τ , in sharp contrast with the main results of this paper
concerning the 2D and 3D geometries. As no such exact
solutions are available in these higher dimensions, we re-
sort below to an approximate scheme that interpolates
the exact asymptotics obtained in both limits τ (cid:28) a/v
and b/v (cid:28) τ .

A. Diﬀusive limit

In the limit τ (cid:28) a/v, the MFPT is independent of
the direction of the initial velocity θ and on the na-
ture of the conﬁning boundary (specular, scattering or
stubborn). Following [12], it can be shown that in this
limit the MFPT satisﬁes the equation: D∆(cid:104)t(r)(cid:105) = −1
where D = v2τ /d. In the large volume limit a (cid:28) b, it is
straightforward to obtain that [31]

t(1) =

in 2D, and(cid:10)t(cid:11) ∼ t(1) = πb3/(3avτ ) in 3D. We emphasize

τ(cid:28)a/v

that in the diﬀusive limit, the search time is a decreasing
function of the persistence time, for any type of conﬁning
boundary (specular, scattering or stubborn).

B. Ballistic limit and uniform approximation

In the limit τ (cid:29) b/v, the behavior of the search time

crucially depends on the boundary condition at r = b.

Specular boundary condition We ﬁrst consider the
case of a specular boundary that reﬂects incoming
searchers according to Descartes law. To evaluate the
search time in this regime, we ﬁrst write the probability
of hitting the target within a single run after a tumble

where: (i) pr(r) is the probability distribution of the po-
sition at the previous reorientation event. For r (cid:29) a,
it can be assumed that pr is uniform over the domain.
(ii) pdir(r) is the probability of choosing a direction that
crosses the target (either directly or after a single reﬂec-
tion at r = b). In the case of a specular conﬁning bound-
ary, pdir(r) = 2 · a/(πr) (2D) and pdir(r) = 2 · a2/(4r2)
(3D) at ﬁrst order in a/r (cid:28) 1. The factor 2 is due to
trajectories that cross the target after a single reﬂection
on the boundary r = b. (iii) preach(r) is the probability
of performing a suﬃciently long run to reach the target,
which for exponentially distributed runs reads:

Partitioning over the ﬁrst run, one then writes (cid:10)t(cid:11) =
phτf + (1− ph)((cid:10)t(cid:11) + τ ), where τf is the mean duration of
(a/b (cid:28) 1), we expect that ph (cid:28) 1 so that (cid:10)t(cid:11) ∼ τ /ph.

The GMFPT is therefore an increasing function of τ in
the limit τ (cid:29) b/v that diverges in the limit τ = ∞.
Indeed, a ballistic particle that is not initiated in the di-
rection of the target will never cross the target. Together
with the above analysis of the diﬀusive regime, this shows
that the GMFPT can be minimized as a function of τ .

We now verify that an accurate uniform approximate

of the GMFPT is given by

= t(1) + t(2).

(7)
The fact that t(2) → 0 in the diﬀusive limit and t(1) → 0
in the ballistic limit shows that this approximation is
accurate in both limit regimes; it was further checked
numerically that the agreement is good for all values of τ
(see Fig. 2a,b). We mention that Ref. [32] makes use of a
similar method. Importantly, this approximate solution
makes it possible to analyze analytically the minimiza-
tion of the GMFPT. Indeed, we ﬁnd that the expression

is minimized for a mean run duration

t(1)(τm) = topt. We
as the solution of the equation:
obtain τm = a/(2v) ln (b/a) in 2D, and τm = πa/(6v)
in 3D. Similarly, for the upper bound of the plateau τp,
the condition t(2)(τm) = topt leads to τp = (8b)/(πv)
(2D) and τp = (3b)/(v) (3D). Mind that the length of
the interval τp − τm is an increasing function of b: the
search time is all the more ﬂat around its optimum as
the size of the conﬁnement b is increased. Therefore, the
determination of the optimum is all the more sensitive
to statistical errors as b increases. In Fig. 3, the search
time is averaged over 107 trajectories in 2D, and over 105
trajectories in 3D, for each value of b and τ .

Scattering boundary We now consider the case of a
scattering boundary – at which the searcher is scattered
in a random direction. This condition corresponds to a
widely used assumption about gas scattering on weakly
adsorbing surfaces, known as Knudsen cosine law [33]. It
can also be used to model the behavior of bacteria at the
encounter of a boundary [34]. Following the analysis of
the ballistic limit for a specular boundary condition, we
introduce the quantity ps as the probability that the tar-
get is found between 2 successive scattering events at the
boundary. We then consider the large τ expansion of such
quantity: ps = p(0)
s /τ n
refers to the probability for the searcher to perform n

s /τ + O(1/τ 2), where p(n)

s + p(1)

Numerical integration leads to the values χ2 = 0.74 . . .
in 2D and χ3 = 0.61 . . . in 3D.

We next introduce the mean cord crossing time be-
tween two point on the boundary r = b, which reads
τc = (4/π)b in 2D and τc = b in 3D. In the limit b (cid:29) a,

the GMFPT is then given by (cid:10)t(cid:11) ∼ τc/ps. Using the

above expression for ps, we obtain:

Mind that πχ2 − 2 = 0.17 . . . > 0 and similarly 2χ3 − 1 =
0.23 . . . > 0. We verify the predictions of Eqs. (13–14)
in Figs 2c,d.

We conclude that, in the ballistic limit, increasing the
rate of tumble 1/τ necessarily decreases the search time
as compared to the pure ballistic motion. The asymptotic
relations Eqs. (13) and (14) thus prove the existence of
an optimum when the conﬁning boundary is scattering in
2D and 3D, respectively. This means that the optimum is
not caused by the choice of the specular boundary condi-
tion, but is rather an intrinsic property of the RTW. Our
intuitive interpretation for the optimum is as follows: by

mized as a function of τ . The uniform approximate of the

III. L´EVY WALKS

We next study numerically the case of L´evy walks,
whose run durations are distributed according to a sym-
metric L´evy law that is restricted to the positive axis,
with an index α > 1 and a scale parameter τ . The dis-
tribution of run duration is deﬁned through the Fourier
transform ˆP (k) = exp(−τ kα), and is characterized by its
heavy-tails P (t) ∼ t−α−1 for t → ∞. Here, we focus on
a 2D geometry with specular boundary conditions. For
0 < α < 1, the persistence length is inﬁnite, hence, with
specular boundary, the search time is inﬁnite. For all
α > 1, the search time can be minimized as a function of
τ . The optimal value τopt decreases when α is increased
(see Fig. 5a). In particular, the search time for the L´evy
strategy is minimized when α = 2, i.e. when the length
of the ballistic excursions has a ﬁnite second moment and
the central limit applies. We point out that the choice of
a L´evy walks, even with exponents close to α = 2, does
not provide any quantitative advantage to ﬁnd the target
over exponential-RTW (see Fig. 5a).

IV. REGULAR WALKS

In this section we focus on the 2D geometry and we
ﬁnd that the regular-step walk, i.e. with reorientations
at deterministic time intervals τ , can outperform both

ﬁnement at b/a = 200 with (a) specular conﬁnement, for

(b) Search time for a regular-step walk
with scattering conﬁnement: simulations (solid orange line)
indicate a sharp minimum at τ = b, as predicted by our ap-

the exponential walk (solid blue line).

increasing the reorientation rate, the searcher increases
its chance to tumble closer to the target, where the prob-
ability to choose the target’s direction in the forthcoming
run is higher.

For this case of scattering boundary conditions, the
uniform approximation cannot be used to determine the
minimum of the MFPT, as the MFPT converges to a
ﬁnite value in the limit τ → ∞. However, analysis of
numerical simulations conﬁrm a similar scaling to Eq.

search process is faster for a specular boundary than for a
scattering one. This can be interpreted by a geometrical
factor: in the ballistic limit, the probability to select a di-
rection that leads to the target pdir(r) is two-times higher
for a specular boundary than for a scattering boundary.
Stubborn boundary We call stubborn condition the
case in which the particle sticks upon arrival at the ex-
ternal boundary, and remains at the bounday for the re-
maining time before the next reorientation towards the
interior of the domain. In this case, the search time di-

verges as (cid:10)t(cid:11) ∼ τ /ps = 2τ b2/a2 in the ballistic limit

listic limit, we deﬁne the probability ph according to Eq.
(3). In the limit a (cid:28) 1, we expect the probability dis-
tribution of the position at reorientation events to fol-
low the uniform distribution on the sphere, hence that
pr(r) ∼ sin(r)/2. The probability of choosing a direction
that crosses the target, either directly or after a pass-
ing over the South pole, reads pdir(r) = (2/π)θa, where
θa is deﬁned in Eq. (B3). Last, the probability of per-
forming a suﬃciently long run to reach the target reads:
We notice that pr(r)×pdir(r) ∼ a/π in the limit a/r (cid:28)

preach(r) =(cid:0)e−r/τ + e−(2π−r)/τ(cid:1) /2.

in this limit. Using the uniform approximation method
presented in Sec. II B, we ﬁnd that the optimal search
time reads τopt ∼ 2π/ log(π/a) at leading order in a (cid:28) 1.

We point out that Eq.

(20) yields the same scaling
as Eq. (9), with however a smaller numerical prefactor.
We suggest that the origin of this discrepancy is related
to the following speciﬁcity of the spherical geometry: at
the South pole (r ∈ [π − a, π + a]), all ballistic trajec-
tories eventually cross the target at the North pole (see
App. B). The optimal reorientation time is shifted to
lower values, since shorter reorientation times enhance
the probability of tumbles within the South pole region
whereby the probability to reach the North pole during
the next run is high.

EXTENSIONS AND CONCLUSION

Finally, we suggest that our result could also apply to
a many-body billiard problem, in which the short-range
interactions between freely ballistic particles result in tra-
jectories that can be described as RTWs. The Knudsen
regime, in which the mean free path is comparable to the
dimension of the conﬁnement [36, 37], is the analogue
of the ballistic limit. In this context, as the mean free
path is controlled by the density of particles, our main
result suggests that an optimal density could enhance the
reaction kinetics of a tracer particle with a ﬁxed target.
To conclude, we have shown that the search time for a
target in a bounded domain for a run and tumble searcher

and τ = b/(3v).
Indeed, the values τ = b/(nv) max-
imize the probability to reach the target after nth re-
orientation events before a new scattering event at the
boundary. We present an analytical description of the
minimum at τ = b/v in the App. A. At optimality, the

V. CURVED GEOMETRY

We now show that these results can be extended to
other geometries. We consider a RTW with exponen-
tially distributed runs on a sphere, which is represented
in Fig. 6a. The coordinate r here refers to the latitude
on the sphere, with r ∈ [0, π]; the target consists in the
North pole region with maximal latitude a. The imple-
mentation of simulation is detailed in the App. B. We
now proceed to the analysis of the optimal reorientation

rabcan be minimized by tuning the persistence time. This
result is robust and holds for diﬀerent boundary condi-
tions in 2D and 3D; it was also obtained for deterministic
walks and L´evy walks with ﬁnite ﬁrst moment. This op-
timal search strategy, which applies to single targets or
equivalently regularly spaced targets, therefore notably

diﬀers from the the case of Poisson-distributed targets
[14], for which the trivial ballistic motion minimizes the
search time. These results therefore highlight the crucial
role of the spatial distribution of targets in search prob-
lems, and put forward the robustness of optimal RTWs
for single target search problems.

Appendix A: Analytical results for a regular

run-and-tumble walk

Here, we consider that reorientations occur at regular
time intervals τ , i.e.
the distribution of reorientation
times reads π(t) = δ(t − τ ), where δ is the Dirac
function. We recall that in the presence of a scattering
boundary condition at r = b, the search time exibits a
sharp minimum at τ = b/v. We obtain an analytical
description for the minima at τ = b/v in 2D.

We start by considering that the searcher is started
at the scattering boundary r = b. After a time
τ ,
the particle is either ˜r(θ) =

(cid:112)b2 + v2τ 2 + 2bvτ cos(θ) ∈ ]a, b[, ˜r(θ) = a or ˜r(θ) = b.

the position of

These three situations may occur, depending on the value
of the ratio (vτ )/b.

First case – b < vτ < 2b Here, we distinguish three
sub-situations, according to the value of the initial direc-
tion θ ∈ [0, π/2] (see Fig. 7).
If π−θa < θ < π, where θa = arcsin (a/b), the searcher
hits the target in a time b/v (up to a minor term that
scales as a/v).
If π − θb < θ < π − θa, where θb = arccos [τ /(2b)], the

searcher is reoriented at the position ˜r(θ) ∈ ]a, b[. The
ﬁnal radius of a searcher whose initial direction is θ = θa
is denoted rb ≡ ˜r(θa) and reads:

rb =

b2 − a2vτ + v2τ 2.

The distribution of ﬁnal position ˜r after a single run is a
non-uniformly distributed random variable, with a den-
sity probability equal to the Jacobian:

Figure 7: Sketches of the search process. The choice τ =
b/(nv) maximizes the probability to reach the target after
the n–th reorientation event: (a) n = 2 (b) n = 1, (c) the
search time increases when τ > b/v.

Notice that the Jacobian deﬁned in Eq. (A2) diverges for
b−τ (i.e. θ = 0), which is expected since a small variation
of ˜r around b− τ corresponds to an abrupt change in the
value of θ.
Finally, if π/2 < θ < π − θb, the searcher takes a time
tb(θ) = −2b cos(θ)/v to reach its ﬁnal position at ˜r = b.
In 2D, the mean return time to the boundary r = b,
averaged over the angles θ ∈ [θb, π/2], reads:

(A3)

Second case – vτ < (b − a) Here, the ﬁnal position
of the particle ˜r(θ) takes all values between b and its
minimal value rb ≡ b − vτ .

Third case – 2b < vτ The search time is a constant
of τ and is strictly equal to the expression of Eq. (2).
Within a single run from the boundary, the target is ei-
ther hit or is missed and the ﬁnal position is ˜r = b. We
set θb = θa if 2b < vτ .

Let us detail the situation in the case b < vτ < 2b.
The renewal equation method [31] leads to the following
integral equation on the search time:

term corresponds to the product of the probability to
reach the boundary at ˜r = b in a single run by the sum
of (a) the average time Eq. (A3) to reach the boundary
at ˜r = b and (b) of the averaged search time from ˜r = b.

The expression Eq. (A6) provides a satisfactory descrip-

ometry.

Appendix B: Sphere geometry

We consider a ballistic particle starts moving from its
initial position at the zenith angle r0 (on the surface of a
sphere of radius 1), where θ0 refers to the angle between
the velocity vector and the position vector (see Fig. 6).
The equation of motion of this ballistic particle reads [38]

cos r(t) = cos r0 cos t + sin r0 sin t cos θ0,

(B1)

where we have set v = 1. To determine whether the
particle will cross the target, we solve Eq. (B1) in terms
of ta with the ﬁnal condition r(ta) = a and we ﬁnd:

cos(r) cos(r0) −(cid:113)

sin2(r0) cos2(θ0)∆

(B2)

sin2(r0) cos2(θ0) + cos2(r0)

The condition ∆ > 0 deﬁnes the critical angle

θa = arccos

.

(B3)

Hence the trajectory crosses the target if the initial angle
θ0 lies either in the interval [0, θa] or in [π − θa, π]. Notice
that for tumbles occurring in the South pole region r ∈
[π − a, π + a], we have θa = π, as expected. Indeed, in
this region, all ballistic trajectories will eventually cross

9

the target at the North pole.

Along a trajectory between r and r(cid:48) of length vt, the
change in longitude δφ can be computed through the re-
lation:

cos(vt) = sin r0 sin r + cos r0 cos r(cid:48) cos(δφ).

(B4)

The set of kinematic equations B2 and B4 are used to
achieve a RTW on the surface of the sphere.
