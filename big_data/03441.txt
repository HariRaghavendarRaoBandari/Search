ABSTRACT

Context. The kinematic characterization of diﬀerent galaxy populations is a key observational input to distinguish
between diﬀerent galaxy evolutionary scenarios, since it helps to determine the number ratio of rotating disks to
mergers at diﬀerent cosmic epochs. Local (U)LIRGs oﬀer a unique opportunity to study at high linear resolution and
S/N extreme star forming events and compare them with those observed at high–z.
Aims. Our goal is to analyze in detail the kinematics of the Hα ionized gas of a large sample of 38 local (z < 0.1)
(U)LIRGs (50 individual galaxies) applying kinematic criteria able to characterize the evolutionary status of these
systems.
Methods. We obtained Very Large Telescope (VLT) VIMOS optical integral ﬁeld spectroscopy (IFS) data of a sample
of 38 (U)LIRGs. The ‘unweighted’ and ‘weighted’ kinemetry–based methods are used to kinematically classify our
galaxies in ‘disk’ and ‘merger’. We simulate our systems at z=3 to evaluate how a loss of angular resolution aﬀects our
results.
Results. From the kinemetry-based analysis we are able classify our local (U)LIRGs in three distinct kinematic groups
according to their total kinematic asymmetry values (Ktot) as derived when using the weighted (unweighted) method:
1) 25 out of 50 galaxies are kinematically classiﬁed as ‘disk’, with a Ktot ≤ 0.16 (0.14); 2) 9 out of 50 galaxies are
kinematically classiﬁed as ‘merger’, with a Ktot ≥ 0.94 (0.66); 3) 16 out of 50 galaxies lie in the ‘transition region’,
in which disks and mergers coexist, with 0.16 (0.14) < Ktot < 0.94 (0.66). When we apply our criteria to the high–z
simulated systems, a lower total kinematic asymmetry frontier value (Ktot ∼ 0.16 (∼ 0.14)) is derived with respect to
that found locally. The loss of angular resolution smears out the kinematic features, thus making objects to appear
more kinematically regular than actually they are.

1. Introduction

In the standard model of hierarchical galaxy assembly
mergers are the dominant source of mass accretion and
growth in massive high-redshift (high-z) galaxies (i.e., Cole
et al. 2000; Somerville et al. 2001). In this scenario, galaxies
are assumed to form at the center of the dark matter ha-
los as the baryonic gas cools (e.g., Baugh 2006), and their
subsequent evolution is controlled by the merging histories
of the halos containing them (e.g., Cole et al. 1994). As
derived from the observations, major merging is undoubt-
edly taking place at high-z (e.g., Tacconi et al. 2006, 2008).
More recently, Kartaltepe et al. (2012), studying a sam-
ple of ULIRGs at z ∼ 2, found that the majority of the
sources show signs of major mergers. These mechanisms
support the hypothesis that gas-rich late-type galaxies can
transform into gas-poor early-type E/S0 galaxies, as pre-
dicted using detailed simulations (Mihos & Hernquist 1996;
Combes 2004; Conselice 2006). As a result of this frame-
work, we expect to ﬁnd galaxies characterized by complex
and disturbed kinematics, such as distorted and asymmet-
ric velocity ﬁelds, as a proof of a strong ongoing interaction.

On the other hand, hydrodynamical

simulations
(Robertson et al. 2006; Governato et al. 2007, 2009;
Hopkins et al. 2009a,b) have shown that the gas fraction
at fusion time and the amount of dissipation in a major
merger of disk galaxies is a key parameter to generate a
bulge dominated/elliptical (i.e., through dry merger) or a
spiral galaxy (i.e., through gas-dominated merger). Indeed,
according to this scenario a disk can be reformed in the rem-
nant when the fraction of gas at the fusion time is higher
than 50% (e.g., Hammer et al. 2009; Puech et al. 2012).

In the last few years many works found that most of
the high–z galaxies show as a disk-like rotating velocity ﬁeld
pattern, although they appear to be turbulent (i.e., Lehnert
et al. 2009; Burkert et al. 2010) as given by their high veloc-
ity dispersion (i.e., σ = 30 – 100 km s−1) and low dynamical
ratio (v/σ < 1; Genzel et al. 2008; F¨orster Schreiber et al.
2009; Wisnioski et al. 2011). In order to explain their kine-
matic patterns in new models of disk formation at high–z,
recent theoretical works (i.e., Kereˇs et al. 2005; Dav´e 2008;
Genel et al. 2008; Dekel et al. 2009a; Ceverino et al. 2010),
based on semi-analytical approaches and hydrodynamical
simulations, have invoked a rapid but more continuous gas

accretion via cold ﬂows and/or minor mergers, which likely
play an important role in driving the mass growth of mas-
sive star forming galaxy at high–z (e.g., Daddi et al. 2007;
Elbaz et al. 2007; Noeske et al. 2007), able to supply gas
directly to the center of the galaxies (i.e., Kereˇs et al. 2005;
Ocvirk et al. 2008; Dekel et al. 2009a). One of the ﬁrst ev-
idences of the ‘clumpy disk’ picture came from the work of
F¨orster Schreiber et al. (2006), observing the Hα emission
of a sample of 14 BM/BX galaxies. They conﬁrmed the
presence of a signiﬁcant fraction of galaxies with rotation
ﬁelds characteristic of disks, large enough to be resolved
in 0.5 arcsec seeing. Then, a large portion of the strongly
star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at z = 1 – 3 does not show the
disturbed kinematics expected according to the hierarchical
model but is characterized by regularly rotating disks (e.g.,
Cresci et al. 2009; Epinat et al. 2009; F¨orster Schreiber et al.
2009; Gnerucci et al. 2011). This result has suggested that
even stronger star formation may be fueled by the accretion
of pristine gas from the halo and by dynamical instabilities
within the massive gaseous disks (Genel et al. 2008; Dekel
et al. 2009b; Bouch´e et al. 2010; Cresci et al. 2010).

The discrepancies between morphological and kinemati-
cal results have increased the importance of kinematic stud-
ies, since objects photometrically irregular in broad-band
HST images show ‘regular’ kinematic maps (i.e., Bournaud
et al. 2008; van Starkenburg et al. 2008; Puech 2010; Jones
et al. 2010; F¨orster Schreiber et al. 2011; Genzel et al. 2011).
Thus, the aforementioned results emphasize the crucial role
of spatially- and spectrally-resolved investigations of galax-
ies at diﬀerent redshifts, such as those based on integral
ﬁeld spectroscopy (IFS), in order to map their morphology
and kinematics.

A useful way to ﬁgure out which is the dominant sce-
nario that drives the galaxy evolution at diﬀerent cosmic
epochs is to estimate the number ratio of (rotating) disks to
mergers (i.e., disk/merger fraction). Some discrepancies can
raise in classifying several kinds of galaxies in disks/mergers
when applying diﬀerent techniques. The ﬁrst and most
widely used technique was the visual morphological clas-
siﬁcation (e.g., Dasyra et al. 2008; Kartaltepe et al. 2010;
Zamojski et al. 2011); then other classiﬁcation methods,
as the estimate of the asymmetry and clumpiness param-
eters (e.g., Conselice et al. 2003) and the use of the Gini-
M20 plane (e.g., Lotz et al. 2008), have been considered
as well. In the last decade, measures of galaxy kinematics
(e.g., Genzel et al. 2008; F¨orster Schreiber et al. 2006, 2009)
have increased their importance: in order to kinematically
classify the systems, a visual (kinematic) classiﬁcation has
been applied at intermediate redshift (i.e., 0.4 ≤ z ≤ 0.7)
by Flores et al. (2006) and Yang et al. (2008) and locally
by Bellocchi et al. (2013) to investigate the properties of
the velocity ﬁelds of galaxies observed with IFS.

The kinematic characterization of diﬀerent galaxy pop-
ulations (Glazebrook 2013 review) is a key observational
input to distinguish between diﬀerent galaxy evolutionary
scenarios, since it helps us to determine the number ra-
tio of rotating disks to mergers at diﬀerent cosmic epochs.
This provides a way of constraining the relative role of
major mergers and steady cool gas accretion in shaping
galaxies, which remains a topic of discussion (e.g. Genzel
et al. 2001; Tacconi et al. 2008; Dekel et al. 2009b; F¨orster
Schreiber et al. 2009; Lemoine-Busserolle & Lamareille
2010; Lemoine-Busserolle et al. 2010; Bournaud et al. 2011;
Epinat 2011).To this aim several authors have already an-

2

alyzed the velocity ﬁelds and velocity dispersion maps of
diﬀerent galaxy samples (e.g., Lyman break analogs LBAs,
Sub-mm galaxies SMGs, (U)LIRGs, Hα emitters, high–
z simulated SINGS spiral galaxies) using the kinemetry
methodology1 (Krajnovi´c et al. 2006, hereafter, K06) with
the aim of discerning merging and non-merging systems on
the base of their kinematic properties (e.g., Shapiro et al.
2008; Gon¸calves et al. 2010; Alaghband-Zadeh et al. 2012;
Bellocchi et al. 2012; Swinbank et al. 2012; Hung et al.
2015).

LIRG (LIR = [8 - 1000 µm] = 1011 - 1012 L(cid:12)) and
ULIRG (ULIRGs, LIR > 1012 L(cid:12)) galaxy populations are
particularly relevant to the study of galaxy evolution since,
although rare in the local universe, they are far more nu-
merous at high–z and responsible for a signiﬁcant fraction
of previous star formation prior to redshift z ∼ 1 (e.g., Le
Floc’h et al. 2005; P´erez-Gonz´alez et al. 2005, 2008). Several
authors have suggested that high–z LIRGs are scaled-up
versions of low–z LIRGs (e.g., Pope et al. 2006; Papovich
et al. 2007; Elbaz et al. 2010, 2011; Nordon et al. 2010,
2012; Takagi et al. 2010), ﬁnding that in the local universe
(U)LIRGs cover a similar SFR range than normal high–z
SFGs (e.g., Wuyts et al. 2011). Therefore, low–z (U)LIRGs
oﬀer a unique opportunity to study at high linear resolu-
tion and S/N extreme star forming events and compare
them with those observed at high–z.

In this paper we present the results from applying
the kinemetry method to a large sample of 38 local
(U)LIRG systems (51 individual galaxies) observed with
the VIMOS/VLT integral ﬁeld unit (IFU). The same ap-
proach as in Bellocchi et al. (2012) will be taken into ac-
count considering both locally observed and high–z simu-
lated (U)LIRGs systems. Thus, this study will allow us to
constrain the disk/merger fraction in the local universe as
well as to compare such ratio with that derived for high–z
populations.

The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we present
the sample giving details about the observations, data re-
ductions, line ﬁtting and map construction. Sect. 3 is de-
voted to the description of the kinemetry analysis and
its potential
in distinguishing disks from mergers when
applying two diﬀerent methods (i.e., Shapiro et al. 2008;
Bellocchi et al. 2012, hereafter, S08 and B12) to a sam-
ple of local and high–z simulated galaxies. Finally, the
main results and conclusions are summarized in Sect. 4.
Throughout the paper we will consider H0 = 70 km s−1
Mpc−1, ΩM = 0.3 and ΩΛ = 0.7.

2. Observations, data reduction and data analysis

2.1. The sample and the morphological class

The (U)LIRG sample analyzed in this work is the same than
that analyzed in Bellocchi et al. (2013) (hereafter, B13)
in which the 2D kinematic properties of the ionized gas
(Hα) are discussed. To summarize, it contains a total of 38
(U)LIRGs systems (51 individual galaxies) of the southern
hemisphere drawn from the Revised Bright Galaxy Sample
(RBGS, Sanders et al. 2003). Of these systems 31 are LIRGs
(i.e., <LIR > = 2.9 ×1011 L(cid:12)) with a mean redshift of
1 Kinemetry is a tool able to quantify kinematic asymmetries
in the velocity ﬁeld and velocity dispersion maps of the systems
with respect to those characterizing an ideal rotating disk. It
will be described in the Sect. 3.

0.024 (corresponding to D ∼ 100 Mpc), and the remain-
ing seven are ULIRGs (i.e., <LIR > =1.6 × 1012 L(cid:12)) with
a mean redshift of 0.069 (D ∼ 300 Mpc; see Tab. 1 and
Arribas et al. (2008), hereafter A08, for details). This sam-
ple thus includes a good representation of the relatively
less studied LIRG luminosity range. It also encompasses
a wide variety of morphological types, suggesting diﬀerent
dynamical phases (isolated spirals, interacting galaxies, and
ongoing- and post-mergers), and nuclear excitations (HII,
Seyfert, and LINER). Eleven out of 51 galaxies show evi-
dence in their optical nuclear spectra of hosting an AGN,
showing high [NII]/Hα values and/or broad Hα emission
lines (e.g., IRAS F07027-6011N, IRAS F05189-2524, IRAS
F12596-1529, IRAS F21453-3511; see Monreal-Ibero et al.
2010; Arribas et al. 2012, 2014 hereafter, MI10, A12, A14,
respectively). Most of these objects (46 out of 51) show out-
ﬂows of ionized gas, studied in A14, while a smaller frac-
tion (22 out of 40) show outﬂows of neutral gas, studied in
Cazzoli et al. (2014, 2016). The sample is not complete ei-
ther in luminosity or in distance. However, it covers well the
relevant luminosity range and is representative of the dif-
ferent morphologies within the (U)LIRG phenomenon (see
Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. Distribution of the VIMOS sample in the infrared
luminosity – redshift plane. The diﬀerent colors represent
the three stages of interactions: in blue are shown the ‘Class
0’ single isolated objects, in green the ‘Class 1’ interacting
galaxies in a pre-coalescence phase and in red the ‘Class 2’
objects representing single systems with evidence of having
suﬀered a merger (post-coalescence phase). The horizontal
dashed line separates the LIRG and ULIRG domains.

The morphological class was derived using Digital Sky
Survey (DSS) ground-based images and, when available,
additional archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images.
Except for one case, the morphological classiﬁcation ac-
cording to the DSS images is in good agreement with that
derived by using the HST images2. The sources have been

morphologically classiﬁed following a simpliﬁed version of
the scheme proposed by Veilleux et al. (2002), with three
main classes instead of ﬁve (see Rodr´ıguez-Zaur´ın et al.
2011, hereafter RZ11, and references therein for further de-
tails). We refer to the images published in B13 (in their
Appendix A) in which the Hα kinematic maps are shown
for each galaxy and to their DSS/HST images published in
RZ11. Brieﬂy, we remind the three morphological classes
deﬁned as follows:

– Class 0: objects that appear to be single isolated galax-
ies, with a relatively symmetric disk morphology and
without evidence for strong past or ongoing interaction
(hereafter, disk).

– Class 1: objects in a pre-coalescence phase with two
well-diﬀerentiated nuclei separated a projected distance
> 1.5 kpc. For these objects, it is still possible to iden-
tify the individual merging galaxies and, in some cases,
their corresponding tidal structures due to the interac-
tion (hereafter, interacting).
– Class 2: objects with two nuclei separated a projected
distance ≤ 1.5 kpc or a single nucleus with a relatively
asymmetric morphology suggesting a post-coalescence
merging phase (hereafter, merger).

In Tab. 1 we present the main properties of the sample.
In some cases the properties of individual galaxies in multi-
ple systems could be inferred separately and were therefore
treated individually (see B13 for details).

2.2. Observations and data reduction

The observations have been described in detail in previous
papers (i.e., A08, MI10, RZ11, B13). In brief, they were car-
ried out using the Integral Field Unit of VIMOS (Le F`evre
et al. 2003), at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), covering
the spectral range (5250− 7400) ˚A with the high resolution
grating GG435 (‘HR-orange’ mode) and a mean spectral
resolution of 3470 (dispersion of 0.62 ˚A pix−1). The eﬀec-
tive ﬁeld of view (FoV) in this conﬁguration is 29.5(cid:48)(cid:48)× 29.5(cid:48)(cid:48),
with a spaxel scale of 0.67(cid:48)(cid:48)per ﬁber (i.e., 1936 spectra are
obtained simultaneously from a 44 × 44 ﬁbers array).

The VIMOS data are reduced with a combination of the
pipeline Esorex (versions 3.5.1 and 3.6.5) included in the
pipeline provided by ESO, and diﬀerent customized IDL
and IRAF scripts. The basic data reduction (i.e., bias sub-
traction, ﬂat ﬁeld correction, spectra tracing and extrac-
tion, correction of ﬁber and pixel transmission and relative
ﬂux calibration) is performed using the Esorex pipeline.
The four quadrants per pointing are reduced individually
and then combined into a single data cube. Then, the four
independent dithered pointing positions are combined to-
gether to end up with the ﬁnal ‘super-cube’, containing
44 × 44 spaxels for each object (i.e., 1936 spectra). For
the wavelength calibration description we refer to A08 and
RZ11.

2 For 19 out of 38 of the systems in our sample DSS and
HST images are available. Only for IRAS F06206-6315 the HST

image reveals more features than those shown in the DSS image,
morphologically classifying this galaxy as type 1 vs. type 2/0
when using, respectively, HST and DSS images.

2.3. Data analysis

The observed Hα and [NII]λλ6548, 6583 ˚A emission lines of
the individual spectra are ﬁtted to Gaussian proﬁles using
an IDL routine (i.e., MPFITEXPR, implemented by C. B.
Markwardt). This algorithm derives the best set of lines
that match the available data. In case of adjusting multiple
lines, the line ﬂux ratios and wavelengths of the diﬀerent
lines are ﬁxed according to the atomic physics. The widths
are constrained to be equal for all the lines and greater than
the instrumental contribution (σIN S). The results of the ﬁt
have been presented in the Appendix A in B13, in which
the Hα maps are shown (i.e., ﬂux intensity, velocity ﬁeld
and velocity dispersion maps).

As largely described in B13, a narrow (or systemic)
and broad components3 have been identiﬁed in most of the
systems to properly ﬁt the spectra. In this analysis we will
focus on the kinematic maps of the systemic component,
assumed to be the narrow component of the emission line,
since the spatial distribution and kinematic properties of
this component represent those of the entire galaxy.

2.4. Simulated high–z observations: the resolution eﬀects

In order to investigate how a decreasing angular resolution
aﬀects our results, we simulate observations at z = 3 with
a typical pixel scale of 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) (the same pixel scale as the
IFU NIRSpec/JWST) as done in B12, just considering res-
olution eﬀects. Since the angular distance evolves less than
10% in the redshift range z = 2 – 3, our simulated obser-
vations at z = 3 are relevant for a direct comparison to
observations at z ∼ 2.
The ‘simulated’ FoV of the maps ranges between
∼1(cid:48)(cid:48)×1(cid:48)(cid:48) up to 5(cid:48)(cid:48)×5(cid:48)(cid:48) with the scale of about 7.7 kpc
arcsec−1 assuming the ΛCDM cosmology considered in this
work.

3. Kinemetry analysis

We investigate the power of the kinemetry methodology in
studying the kinematic asymmetries in (U)LIRG systems.
In particular, the same approach described in B12 (i.e.,
using the S08 and B12 criteria, hereafter, ‘unweighted’ and
‘weighted’ methods respectively) is applied to i) the entire
observed local sample4 and then to ii) the simulated high–
z kinematic maps. In this section the results derived from
applying these two methodologies are discussed.

3.1. The method

moment in polar coordinates where K (x, y) → K (r, ψ).
The map K(r, ψ) can be expanded as follows to a ﬁnite
number (N+1) of harmonic terms (frequencies)

K(r, ψ) = A0(r) +

An(r) sin(n· ψ) + Bn(r) cos(n· ψ)(1)

N(cid:88)

n=1

where ψ is the azimuthal angle in the plane of the galaxy
(measured from the major axis) and r is the radius of a
generic ellipse. The amplitude and the phase coeﬃcients
(kn, φn) are easily calculated from the An, Bn coeﬃcients

as kn =(cid:112)A2

Bn

(cid:17)

.

n

and φn = arctan

For an ideal rotating disk the B1 term dominates the
velocity proﬁle, representing the circular velocity in each
ring r while the A0 term dominates the velocity dispersion
proﬁle giving gives the systemic velocity of each ring. Thus,
higher order terms (An, Bn) indicate deviations from sym-
metry. In the kinemetry analysis we assume for each ellipse
a covering factor = 0.7, a position angle (Γ) and a ﬂatten-
ing (q) free to vary and the peak of the VIMOS continuum
emission as the center of the ellipse.

The covering parameter represents the minimum per-
centage of the points along an ellipse needed to start the
analysis. In our case 0.7 means that if fewer than 70% of the
points along an ellipse are not covered by data the program
stops. The position angle of the velocity ﬁeld (Γ) identiﬁes
the angle where the velocity ﬁeld peaks with respect to the
North coordinate. The ﬂattening (q) is deﬁned as the ra-
tio of the semi-minor (b) to the semi-major (a) axes of the
ellipse, i.e., q= b/a. When let free to vary it allows us to
consider general cases, such as tilted/wrapped disks. For
further details on these assumptions see B12.

3.2. The kinematic criteria: the ‘unweighted’ and ‘weighted’

methods

We have considered diﬀerent kinematic criteria with the
aim of distinguishing systems who have suﬀered recent ma-
jor merger events (i.e., mergers) and those without any
signs of interacting or merger activity (i.e., disks).

As a ﬁrst approach we apply the S08 method (‘un-
weighted’ method) where the kinematic asymmetries of the
velocity ﬁeld and velocity dispersion maps are deﬁned, re-
spectively, as follows:

(cid:28) kavg,v

(cid:29)

B1,v

vasym =

,

r

σasym =

(cid:28) kavg,σ

(cid:29)

(2)

The kinemetry method comprises a decomposition of the
moment maps into Fourier components using ellipses. We
brieﬂy describe the main steps presented in K06 to achieve
a clearer understanding of this analysis.

The Fourier analysis is the most straightforward way to
characterize any periodic phenomenon: the periodicity of
a kinematic moment can easily be seen by expressing the

3 The distinction between narrow and broad components has

been done according to their line widths.

4 The ﬁnal total number of galaxies analyzed in this work with
kinemetry is 50 instead of 51, since the galaxy F08424-3130 N is
located in the edge of the VIMOS FoV and then excluded from
this analysis.

where kavg,v = (k2,v + k3,v + k4,v + k5,v)/4 and kavg,σ =

(k1,σ + k2,σ + k3,σ + k4,σ + k5,σ)/5.

On the other hand, the method presented in B12
(‘weighted’ method) has been applied as well. This revised
method is based on the results that indicate that in a post-
coalescence merger the inner regions are dominated by ro-
tation while the outer parts retain larger kinematic asym-
metries (e.g., Kronberger et al. 2007). With this criterion
the importance of the kinematic asymmetries at larger radii
is enhanced. Indeed, instead of simply averaging the asym-
metries over all radii (as in S08), they are weighted accord-
ing to the number of data points used in their determina-
tion. The number of data points is to ﬁrst approximation

This is the ﬁrst attempt in applying the kinemetry
method along with kinematic criteria to a large sample lo-
cal (z < 0.1) SFGs. This is crucial to understand what is
the fraction of disks and mergers locally in such systems
allowing us to compare such a ratio with those derived for
high–z SFGs.

3.3. Morphological deﬁnition of disks and mergers

As previously described in Sect. 2, our sample consists of
50 individual galaxies covering a large LIR range and en-
compasses a wide variety of morphologies which allow us
to discuss the kinematic asymmetries as a function of the
galaxy properties (e.g., infrared luminosity LIR, morpho-
logical class).

In order to better interpret and discuss our data we
recall the Veilleux et al. (2002) classiﬁcation, according to
which the Interacting (type 1) galaxies can be sub-classiﬁed
as Wide– or Close–Interacting according to their projected
nuclear separation. The presence (or not) of tidal tails
and/or other structures interconnecting the nuclei is consid-
ered using DSS continuum maps and, when available, HST
images since it could help us to better distinguish their
structure. In particular, if the nuclear projected separation
is > 10 kpc, the emission of the two galaxies can be well
separated in the VIMOS maps, and there is no presence
of tidal tails and/or other structures between the nuclei in
their continuum (DSS, HST) maps, the sources are consid-
ered as Wide–Interacting pairs (or paired–disks). A few sys-
tems (i.e., IRAS F06035–7102, IRAS F06206–6315, IRAS
F12596–1529, IRAS F22491–1808, IRAS F23128–5919) are
classiﬁed as Close–Interacting pairs (or ongoing mergers),
since their projected nuclear separation is smaller than 10
kpc (but larger than 1.5 kpc, at which the limit for the co-
alescence phase is deﬁned), their individual contributions
cannot be disentangled in the VIMOS maps5 and they also
show the presence of tidal tail structures in their continuum
maps. These galaxies have a common envelope, and they

because the two galaxies can be well separated in the VIMOS
maps although their nuclear separation is slightly smaller than
10 kpc.

are likely in a more advanced merger phase than the wide-
interacting pairs. Therefore, we have distinguished four dy-
namical phases, where the ﬁrst two are referred as ‘disk’,
while the second two as ‘mergers’ (case I):

We propose such a simpliﬁed morphological (‘disk–
merger’) classiﬁcation to characterize in some way the evo-
lutive status of the galaxies in our sample, which show a
large variety of dynamical phases. In particular, as ‘merger’
we refer to those systems where the interacting galaxies are
close enough to share a common envelope as well as simi-
lar kinematics (which suggests they are probably going to
merge), thus considering them as a single system. As ‘disk’
we include the ‘pure’ (isolated) disk galaxies as well as the
‘paired’ galaxies which, for deﬁnition, do not share a com-
mon envelope as due to their large projected separation. In
this case, we cannot surely conclude that these galaxies are
going to merge and, if they do, it will be in a more advanced
phase.

A similar morphological classiﬁcation for the class 1 (in-
teracting) systems has been considered in A14, in which the
systems have been distinguished as ‘total system’ or ‘indi-
vidual object’.

However, for the isolated disks (class 0) and post–
coalescence mergers (class 2) a clearer dynamical status can
be inferred with respect to that derived for the interacting
systems (class 1), as a result of their diversiﬁed interac-
tion stages, something in between the two aforementioned
classes. To this respect, we also discuss the kinemetry re-
sults derived in the case where only ‘isolated disks’ are con-
sidered as ‘true disks’ (case II). In this case, we exclude the
‘paired disk’ galaxies from such a group as due to their sup-
posed diﬀerent dynamical status (i.e., interacting) with re-
spect to the isolated disks. However, following our ‘merger’
deﬁnition, these ‘paired disks’ are also kept out from the
‘true merger’ group.

3.4. Kinematic distinction between disks and mergers

(cid:113)

Similarly to S08 (‘unweighted’ method) and what done in
B12 (‘weighted’ method) we quantify the total kinematic
asymmetry degree Ktot of each galaxy as the combination
of both the kinematic asymmetry contributions of the veloc-
ity ﬁeld (vasym) and velocity dispersion (σasym) maps, i.e.,
Ktot =
asym) (see Eqs. 2, 3, 4). We ﬁnd that
the ongoing merging systems have the largest kinematic
asymmetry (Ktot), while (isolated and paired) disks and
post-coalescence mergers are characterized by lower Ktot

respect to LIRGs. The mean (median) Ktot values for the
diﬀerent groups are shown in Tab. 2.

The kinematic asymmetry results (i.e., vasym and
σasym) derived for the whole local sample are shown in Fig.
2 when applying, respectively, the unweighted (left pan-
els, [σa-va]) and weighted (right panels, [σw
a ]) criteria.
The same general trend is found in both the planes, where
disks (isolated and paired disks) are characterized by lower
kinematic asymmetries than mergers (ongoing and post-
coalescence mergers).

a -vw

In order to distinguish disks from mergers in the two
kinematic asymmetry planes we try to ﬁnd out a value of
the frontier applying the following approach. Since a quite
large scatter is found in the asymmetry values of each kine-
matic class (i.e., disk and merger populations), the median
value (instead of the mean) of each Ktot distribution is con-
sidered (hereafter, Kmed(disk)
). Then, the
total kinematic asymmetry for the frontier (KF
tot) is com-
puted as the mean value of these two quantities:

and Kmed(merger)

).

The uncertainty associated to this value has been
computed as the mean value of each Median Absolute
Deviation (or MAD)6 estimate associated to each distri-
bution. As shown in Fig. 2, for Ktot ≤ KF
tot - 1 MAD no
mergers are found, while for Ktot ≥ KF
tot + 1 MAD disks
do not exist (dashed black frontiers). Indeed, the more dis-
turbed objects are those classiﬁed as ongoing-mergers (i.e.,
IRAS F06035–7102, IRAS F06206–6315, IRAS F12596–
1529, IRAS F22491–1808, IRAS F23128–5919)7 along with
some post-coalescence sources which show high asymme-
tries (i.e., IRAS F05189–2524, IRAS 09022–3615, IRAS

6 The respective uncertainty associated to the median value of
the total kinematic asymmetry has been computed as median-
absolute-deviation (hereafter, MAD). It returns a data set’ s me-
dian absolute deviation from the median, that is median(—data
- median(data)—). It is a proxy for the standard deviation, but
is more resistant against outliers.

7 These sources may appear as such either because they are
actually in the early phase of merging or because the limited
angular resolution of VIMOS does not allow to separate the
contribution of each galaxy.

tot - 1 MAD < Ktot < KF

F10257–4339, IRAS F13001–2339), characterized by very
disturbed kinematic maps. There is a ‘transition region’
(i.e., KF
tot + 1 MAD) where the
distinction between disk/merger is diﬃcult. The large dis-
persion and overlapping in the kinemetry results derived
for our isolated, pre- and post-coalescence systems high-
light the uncertainty in deriving a clear value of Ktot able
to clearly separate disks from mergers. The middle pan-
els in the same ﬁgure show the corresponding probability
distribution functions (PDFs) of each morphological class
normalized to the number of objects in each bin.

Both the unweighted and weighted methods give simi-
lar results, although the weighted one allows to distinguish
slightly better disks from mergers. This is better visible if,
apart from the statistical approach, we determine the ‘op-
timal’ value of the frontier able to classify our local sources
in disk and merger galaxies (dashed red frontier): to this
aim, the number of well classiﬁed galaxies as a function
of the Ktot is derived. Since in our sample the number of
disks dominates on the number of mergers, we then deﬁne
an ‘index’ parameter (I) as the sum of the respective frac-
tions of well classiﬁed systems in each morphological class
(i.e., Idisk for disks and Imerger for mergers). In particular,
I is deﬁned in Eq. 6:

I = Idisk + Imerger =

=

#well class disks

total # disks

+

#well class mergers

total # mergers

(6)

The results are shown in the bottom panels of Fig. 2
in the two cases (i.e., unweighted and weighted methods):
the disk contribution is represented in blue, the merger one
is shown in green and the total one in magenta. The total
observed distribution allows to determine the optimal Ktot
frontier value for which the largest fraction of well classi-
ﬁed systems (Imax) is achieved: this value is also shown in
the ﬁgure. In each distribution two peaks are found and we
refer to them as ‘main’ and ‘secondary’ peaks. The main
peak Imax identiﬁes the Ktot value(s) which well classiﬁes
the largest fraction of systems, where Ktot(Imax) ∼ 0.15
and 0.19, in the unweighted and weighted planes, respec-
tively. As visible in the ﬁgure, the statistical Ktot values
(i.e., Ktot ± 1 MAD) approximate well the main and sec-

ondary peaks, also deﬁning the region where the distinction
between disk/merger is diﬃcult.

largely exceed the number of mergers by a factor of 7 (44
disks – 6 mergers, 12% mergers).

Thus, at low–z the largest value of I is derived when the
weighted method is applied (i.e., Imax = 1.8, Ktot(Imax)
= 0.19), although it is only slightly larger than that de-
rived in the unweighted plane (Imax ∼ 1.7). The rela-
tive disk/merger fraction derived locally according to the
weighted frontier in our sample is 27/23, implying that the
number of disks almost equals that of mergers. When con-
sidering the frontier adopted by S08 (Ktot = 0.5) the in-
dex I reaches the value of ∼ 1.6, clearly lower than our
optimal value and close to the secondary peak. If we con-
sider this frontier half of the post-coalescence mergers are
misclassiﬁed as disks, leading to an overestimation of the
disk/merger ratio. Indeed, according to their frontier the
disk/merger fraction is 40/10, implying that the 80% of
our objects would be classiﬁed as disks.

However, a good agreement is found between the mor-
phology and the kinematic classiﬁcation: in particular, the
Idisk and Imerger fractions for the low–z sample are, respec-
tively, 79% (74%) vs. 100% for the weighted (unweighted)
plane when isolated and paired disks are considered as ‘true
disks’.

If only isolated disk galaxies are considered as ‘true
disks’, the distribution of the total number of well classiﬁed
galaxies (index I) as a function of Ktot in the unweighted
and weighted planes (Fig. 4) follows the same trend than
that found in the former case (bottom panels in Figs. 2, 3).
In Tab. 3 a comparison of the diﬀerent (morphologi-
cal and kinematic) classiﬁcations of the (U)LIRG sample is
summarized.

3.5. Total kinematic asymmetries of high–z simulated

(U)LIRGs

a -vw

We apply kinemetry to the high–z simulated kinematic
maps (see Sect.2.4) and the results are shown in Fig. 3, re-
spectively, for the unweighted (left panels, [σa-va]High−z)
a ]High−z) planes. As ex-
and weighted (right panels, [σw
pected, the results are characterized by lower kinematic
asymmetries than those obtained locally (e.g., Gon¸calves
et al. 2010, B12). This result is due to the fact that
when lowering the linear resolution the kinematic devia-
tions are smoothed, making objects to appear more sym-
metric than they actually are. However, a few sources
among the ongoing- (i.e., IRAS F06035–7102, IRAS F2249–
1808, IRAS F23128–5919) and post-coalescence (i.e., IRAS
F09022–3615,
IRAS F10257–4339,
IRAS F13001–2339) mergers still preserve quite high val-
ues.

IRAS F05189–2524,

Thus, the distribution of the number of well classiﬁed
objects as a function of the Ktot is considered (bottom pan-
els in Fig. 3). The main and secondary peaks are identiﬁed
as well. The maximum index I of 1.7 is reached in both the
planes where the Ktot assumes the (average) value of ∼ 0.14
and ∼ 0.16 in the unweighted and weighted planes, respec-
tively. We derive a disk/merger ratio at high–z of 26/24,
which is approximately the same ratio found locally. The
value adopted by S08 would imply an index I of ∼ 1.4,
clearly lower than the optimal value derived by us. In this
case about two thirds of our ‘mergers’ would be classiﬁed
as ‘disks’, largely overestimating the disk/merger ratio in
our sample. In such a case the total number of disks would

For the high–z simulated sample the derived Idisk and
Imerger fractions result, respectively, in 76% and 94% (for
both the methods) when isolated and paired disks are con-
sidered as ‘true disks’. If we exclude the paired disks from
the ‘true disk’ group, similar results are derived as well (i.e.,
85% and 94%; Tab. 4).

3.6. Comparison between low– and high–z kinemetry results

in our (U)LIRG sample

As a result, the comparison between local and high–z results
obtained using both the unweighted and weighted methods
allows to draw the following conclusions:

– At low–z similar results are found for the unweighted
and the weighted methods, although for the weighted
one ‘disks’ are slightly better separated from ‘mergers’.
The optimal Ktot value able to classify the largest num-
ber of objects is ∼ 0.19: according to this result the de-
rived disk/merger fraction found locally is 27/23 (54%
disks, 46% mergers).

– A ‘transition region’ (| Ktot - KF

tot | < 1 MAD) where
the disk/merger classiﬁcation in uncertain is found in
the asymmetry plane with the total kinematic values (at
low–z) in the range 0.16 (0.14) < Ktot < 0.94 (0.66) for
the weighted (unweighted) plane(s). Outside this range

disks and mergers.

– At high–z, a trend similar to that found locally is ob-
tained but characterized by lower total kinematic asym-
metries Ktot as a consequence of the resolution ef-
fects. Slightly better results are derived when using the
weighted method, in which the main peak in the I dis-
tribution is better deﬁned, with a Ktot ∼ 0.16 and a
resulting disk/merger ratio of 26/24 (52% disks, 48%
mergers);

– If the frontier obtained by S08 (Ktot = 0.5) is considered,
the fraction of well classiﬁed objects (I) would be clearly
lower down to 1.6 – 1.4 with respect to our optimal
values (I ∼ 1.8 – 1.7), respectively, at low– and at high–
z. The S08 limit implies that at least half of the post-
coalescence mergers would be misclassiﬁed as disks thus
leading to an overestimation of the disk/merger ratio,
with more than 80% of the sources classiﬁed as ‘disk’.

– If only isolated disks are considered as ‘true disks’, the
index distribution I as a function of Ktot in both the
planes, at low– and at high–z, follows the same general
trend than that derived when isolated and paired disks
are considered as ‘true disks’. In both the cases, the
derived fractions of ‘well classiﬁed disks’ vs. ‘well classi-
ﬁed mergers’ according to the two methods give similar
results both locally (∼80% vs. 100%) and at high–z (75–
85% vs. 94%; Tab. 4).

for an overlapped subsample of 8 interacting systems8. The
H15 analysis is based on the application of the unweighted
and weighted kinemetry–based methods to a sample of
local (U)LIRGs observed with Wide Field Spectrograph
(WiFeS) and artiﬁcially redshifted to z=1.5 degrading spa-
tial resolution and sensitivity.

Two of these systems (F06076–2139 and F12043–3140)
clearly show in the HST and DSS images, respectively, the
presence of two merging galaxies in each system, which
could not be resolved when simulated at high–z in H15.
Their simulated kinematic maps show a complex and irreg-
ular pattern and are classiﬁed as ‘merger’ according to the
B12 criteria. Excluding these two systems, our kinematic
classiﬁcation of the 6 remaining systems (8 galaxies) is in
good agreement with their ﬁndings. We only ﬁnd disagree-
ment for 2 of these galaxies (F10257–4339 and F18093–
5744 S), classiﬁed as ‘merger’ and ‘disk’, respectively, in
this work. Thus, for these 8 galaxies, the same disk/merger
fraction (2/6) is derived in both the works according to the
frontier considered in H15 and that derived in this analysis.
If we consider the results derived for our simulated subsam-
ple at z=3 the derived disk/merger ratio becomes 3/5, since
F17138–1017 shows more ordered kinematic maps at high–z
than locally, classiﬁed as ‘disk’ according to this analysis.
For this subsample the fractions of correctly identiﬁed
disks and mergers according to our analysis are Idisk = 2/3
and Imerger = 5/5; according to the H15 analysis, Idisk =
0/1, Imerger = 5/7, since IRAS F17138–1017 is the only
galaxy morphologically classiﬁed as isolated disk but kine-
matically classiﬁed as merger. Thus, a larger number of
well classiﬁed disks and mergers is derived according to our
analysis (67% and 100%) with respect to that derived in
H15 (0% and 71%).

A smaller fraction of mergers at high–z has been also de-
rived by Gon¸calves et al. (2010), observing a set of Lyman
Break Analogs (LBAs) at z ∼ 0.2 and redshifted their sam-
ple at z = 2.2. The worse resolution of their simulated maps

8 The overlapped subsample is composed by the following
galaxies: F06076–2139 (type 1), 08355–4944 (type 2), F10038–
3338 (type 2), F10257–4339 (type 2), F12043–3140 (type 1),
F17138–1017 (type 2), F18093–5744 (type 1), F23128–5919
(type 1).

let decrease the fraction of mergers from low– to high–z,
respectively, from ∼ 70% to < 30% according to the S08
limit.

The angular resolution at which a sample is observed
plays a key role in classifying galaxies as ‘disk’ or ‘merger’.
On the one hand, the loss of angular resolution, when sim-
ulating individual galaxies at high–z, tends to smooth the
asymmetries in their kinematic maps, making objects to
appear more ‘disky’; on the other hand, when simulating
close interacting systems at high–z, it could result in un-
resolved systems which show more complicated kinematics
than if resolved.

3.8. The relationships between the Ktot versus LIR, v∗/σ

and the projected nuclear separation

In this section the relations between the total kinematic
asymmetry Ktot and some kinematical and dynamical pa-
rameters are considered. In particular, some trends are
found when considering the Ktot as a function of the in-
frared luminosity LIR, the dynamical ratio v∗/σ9 and the
projected nuclear separation. Since at low–z the Ktot values
for the unweighted and weighted planes are only slightly dif-
ferent and the same general trend is conserved, we take into
account the unweighted values (i.e., Ktot = 0.145) for a pos-
sible comparison with other previous works (e.g., Gon¸calves
et al. 2010; Alaghband-Zadeh et al. 2012; Swinbank et al.
2012).

3.8.1. The Ktot – LIR relation

In Fig. 5 the linear trend between the total kinematic asym-
metries Ktot as a function of the infrared luminosity LIR is
shown. This plot clearly shows the (morphological and kine-
matical) results summarized in Tab. 2. The majority of the
objects with a luminosity LIR ≥ 11.4 L(cid:12) show high total
kinematic asymmetries (19 out of 28 galaxies with Ktot >
0.14, green dashed area) and are classiﬁed as mergers. On
9 The v∗/σ is the intrinsic dynamical ratio deﬁned as the ratio
of the intrinsic velocity shear to the mean velocity dispersion.
See B13 for further details on how these parameters have been
computed.

Ktot in the unweighted (left) and weighted (right) planes when assuming that only the isolated disks are
considered as ‘true disks’ and ongoing and post–coalescence mergers are considered as ‘true mergers’. The
red dashed lines represent the ‘optimal’ frontier which give us the Ktot values for which the maximum index
I is derived; the solid black line is the KF
tot value derived according to Eq. 5 while the two dashed black lines
represent the statistical frontiers (KF

tot ± 1 MAD).

the other hand, most of the less luminous ones (LIR < 11.4
L(cid:12), 15 out of 22 galaxies with Ktot < 0.14, blue dashed
area) have lower kinematic asymmetries and are classiﬁed
as disks. Thus, the luminosity value of log LIR ∼ 11.4 L(cid:12)
seems to suggest it could be considered as a threshold value
able to distinguish disks from mergers, but a sample com-
plete in luminosity is needed to conﬁrm this result.

3.8.2. The Ktot – v∗/σ relation

A clear correlation between the diﬀerent phases of the merg-
ing process and the mean kinematic properties inferred
from the kinematic maps has been found in our sample. In
particular, isolated disks, interacting galaxies, and merg-
ing systems deﬁne a sequence of increasing mean velocity
dispersion and decreasing velocity ﬁeld amplitude, which is
characterized by intrinsic average dynamical ratios (v∗/σ)
of 4.7, 3.0, and 1.8, respectively (see B13).

A correlation between the morphology and the LIR has
been already found in Veilleux et al. (2002): they derived
that LIRGs are generally spirals which show a morphology
much less disturbed than that shown in ULIRGs in the
early phase of the interaction.

In a similar way, the total kinematic asymmetry Ktot
quantiﬁes the kinematic asymmetry degree in a galaxy with
respect to the ideal rotating disk case. In Fig. 6 the rela-
tion between (unweighted) Ktot and v∗/σ for each source
is considered. A (linear log – log) inverse trend is found:

values, Ktot, as a function of the infrared luminosity, LIR.
The vertical solid black line separates the LIRG–ULIRG
domain, while the vertical dashed pink line represents the
infrared luminosity value which could separate ‘disks’ from
‘mergers’. The horizontal dashed red line identiﬁes the
Ktot(Imax) = 0.145 value.

the more rotation-dominated objects (v∗/σ > 2) gener-
ally show lower values of the total kinematic asymmetries
(Ktot < 0.14) with respect to those derived for dispersion-
dominated systems (i.e., v∗/σ < 2, Ktot > 0.14), as ex-
pected. In order to quantify how well the 1D parameter
v∗/σ classiﬁes disks and mergers in our sample with re-
spect to the kinemetry results, we compute the fraction of
well classiﬁed objects as before (i.e., Sect. 3.4 and 3.5) de-
riving an index I = 1.4. This value is smaller than the one
obtained using the total kinematic asymmetry Ktot, which
is indicative that when the full 2D information is taken into
account to study the kinematic asymmetries a better clas-
siﬁcation is obtained. All the ULIRGs are well classiﬁed as
mergers according to our kinemetry frontier while only a
small fraction (3 out of 7) is classiﬁed as such according to
the v∗/σ parameter. This conﬁrms the importance of the
2D kinematic analysis in unveiling the real status of these
systems.
Our dynamical ratio threshold (v∗/σ = 2) is in good
agreement with that derived by Kassin et al. (2012). Indeed,
studying the kinematics of a large sample of 544 blue galax-
ies over the last ∼ 8 billion years (0.2 < z < 1.2), they found
that such systems become progressively more ordered with
time as distorted motions decrease and rotation velocities
increase. They deﬁne a kinematically ‘settled disk’ as hav-
ing a ratio of ordered/random motions larger than three
(v/σ > 3), also deriving that the fraction of settled disks
increases with time (decreases with z) since z = 1.2 for
galaxies with stellar mass over 8 < log M(cid:63) < 10.7. The
kinematic disk settling has be explained as due to: 1) a high
frequency of merging at high–z and 2) higher gas fraction
at early times. Since both these factors decrease with time,
a general kinematic settling is expected with time (‘kine-
matic downsizing’). According to their work, the galaxies
settle to become the rotation-dominated disks found in the
universe today, with the most massive galaxies being the

Fig. 6. The relation between the total kinematic asymme-
try Ktot and the intrinsic dynamical ratio v∗/σ is shown.
The more rotation dominated objects (v∗/σ> 2) are those
showing the lower kinematic asymmetry, while an opposite
trend is found for the dispersion-dominated objects. The
colors and symbols used are the same as in the previous
ﬁgures. Black stars represent ULIRGs while black square

most evolved at any time. Furthermore, at all redshifts they
found that the most massive galaxies are on average the
most kinematically settled while the least massive galaxies
the least kinematically settled.

In our analysis we derived a similar trend: the most mas-
sive (log<Mdyn> = 10.71 M(cid:12), median value 10.69 M(cid:12)) and
(morphologically) regular objects (class 0 isolated galaxies)
show the highest dynamical ratio (v∗/σ = 4.7) while the less
massive pre- and post-coalescence galaxies (log<Mdyn> =
10.68 M(cid:12), median value 10.54 M(cid:12) and 10.67 M(cid:12), median
value 10.23 M(cid:12), respectively; see Tab.2 in B13) are char-
acterized by lower v∗/σ, of 3.0 and 1.8, respectively.
If we apply a threshold value of v∗/σ = 3 to our data (see
Fig. 5), it also suggests a good frontier to distinguish our
systems in ‘disks’ and ‘mergers’. In such a case, 21 out of 34
objects are well classiﬁed as ‘disks’, while 13 out of 16 are
well classiﬁed as ‘mergers’, deriving an index parameter I =
1.43. This value is larger than the one derived when using
the v∗/σ = 2, but still lower with respect to that derived
when using kinemetry, which gives the largest number of
well classiﬁed ‘disks’ and ‘mergers’.

3.8.3. Kinematic asymmetries as a function of the nuclear

separation along the merger process

We analyze the relation between the projected nuclear sep-
aration and the total kinematic asymmetry Ktot for those
pair of galaxies for which a nuclear separation can be com-
puted. In particular, the nuclear separation can be esti-

Bellocchi et al.: Kinematics asymmetries of (U)LIRGs

tion of the inner parts of these objects explains such results.
The pink dashed line in Fig. 7 helps to highlight the possi-
ble average evolutionary sequence obtained when a galaxy
goes through the wide-interacting to the post-coalescence
phases.

As shown in this plot, a trend is found between the inter-
action stage (based on a morphological classiﬁcation) and
the kinematic asymmetries of our systems. Our results are
in agreement with those presented in H15 (Fig. 3 in their
work), where the fraction of disk/merger galaxies classi-
ﬁed using the kinemetry criteria is shown as a function
of the interaction stage. The agreement between our and
their results can be explained as follows. A galaxy with a
low value of the total kinematic asymmetry Ktot (<0.16) re-
sults in a ‘disk’-like (regular) kinematics while a high Ktot
value (>0.9) corresponds to a more disturbed and complex
kinematics. Thus, Ktot can be considered as a proxy of the
fraction of mergers. In their work, going through the diﬀer-
ent interaction stages, from isolated to post-coalescence ob-
jects (from S to M4 stages), the maximum merger fraction
is reached in the case of merged galaxies which still show
two distinct nuclei (M3): their M3 galaxies correspond to
our close-interacting systems, that show the highest Ktot
values. In particular, the mean Ktot values (see Tab. 2) as a
function of the interaction stage (isolated and paired disks,
ongoing- and post-coalescence mergers) reproduce a trend
similar to that derived by H15.

4. Summary

We have carried out a kinemetry-based classiﬁcation for
a large sample of 38 local (z < 0.1) (U)LIRG systems ob-
served with VIMOS/VLT with IFS. The sample covers a
wide range of morphological types (i.e., spirals, interacting
systems and merger remnants) and it is therefore well suited
to study how the kinemetry–based criteria are able to dis-
tinguish disks and mergers in our objects. The disk/merger
fraction allow us to constrain diﬀerent evolutionary scenar-
ios. Speciﬁcally we have applied the S08 (‘unweighted’) and
B12 (‘weighted’) criteria to derive the total kinematic asym-
metry (Ktot) to our observed sample as well as to simulated
data, ‘redshifting’ our sample at z=3. From our analysis we
draw the following conclusions:

Kinematic distinction between disks/mergers

1. The kinematic properties derived using the kinemetry–
based methods are consistent with their morphological
classiﬁcation. The results obtained using the weighted
and unweighted methods are similar when the whole
sample is considered.

2. We can distinguish our sample in three kinematic groups
according to the total kinematic asymmetry value Ktot
when using the weighted (unweighted) method: 1) 25
out of 50 galaxies are kinematically classiﬁed as ‘disk’,
with a Ktot ≤ 0.16 (0.14); 2) 9 out of 50 galaxies are
kinematically classiﬁed as ‘merger’, with a Ktot ≥ 0.94
(0.66); 3) 16 out of 50 galaxies lie in the ‘transition

Fig. 7. Relation between the mean total kinematic asym-
metry Ktot and the nuclear projected separation in (wide
and close) interacting and merging systems. The Ktot of
a system generally increases with the decreasing of the
nuclear separation: it reaches its maximum value in on-
going (pre-coalescence) mergers, then decreasing for post-
coalescence mergers. The colors and symbols used are the
same as in the previous ﬁgure (Fig. 6). The pink dashed
line helps to highlight the evolutionary trend found when
a galaxy goes from the wide-interacting phase to the post-
coalescence one. The horizontal dashed red line is the same
than that shown in Fig. 5.

mated for 19 systems10. An upper limit has been computed
for the majority of the type 2 galaxies (assuming a nuclear
separation smaller than the resolution element of the image
considered). The HST and VIMOS continuum images have
been used to derive the projected nuclear separation. In
three cases (i.e., IRAS F01341–3735, IRAS F09437+0317,
IRAS F14544–4255) the DSS images have been used since
a larger FoV was needed to cover the whole system.

In Fig. 7 the mean value of the (unweighted) Ktot
(<Ktot>) of each system is related to its nuclear projected
separation. This plot highlights the fact that, during the
ﬁrst phases of the merging process, the smaller the nuclear
separation of a system the higher its total kinematic asym-
metry. Moreover, the maximum asymmetry value Ktot is
reached for the ongoing mergers with nuclear separation
∼ 2-5 kpc, in which the merger phase is currently taking
place. Then, a more unclear trend is shown for the post-
coalescence mergers (i.e., type 2; nuclear separation less
than 1.5 kpc), although their values are generally lower
than those characterizing ongoing mergers. The virializa-

morphology is Ktot = 0.19 (∼0.15): we obtain 27 (25)
‘disks’ and 23 (25) ‘mergers’ according to this value.
The percentages of ‘correctly identiﬁed’ disks and merg-
ers at low–z result in, respectively, 79% (74%) – 100%. If
only isolated disk galaxies are considered as ‘true disks’,
similar fractions are obtained with both the methods.

4. When we apply our criteria to our systems simulated
at z=3 just considering resolution eﬀects, a lower to-
tal kinematic asymmetry frontier (Ktot ∼ 0.16 (∼0.14))
with respect to that found locally is derived when us-
ing the weighted (unweighted) method. We obtain 26
‘disks’ and 24 ‘mergers’ according to this value.
However, the ‘correctly identiﬁed’ disks and merger frac-
tions for the simulated high–z objects is 76% – 94% with
both the methods. If only isolated disk galaxies are con-
sidered as ‘true disks’, these values become, respectively,
85% and 94%.
The loss of angular resolution makes objects to appear
more kinematically regular (‘disky’) than actually they
are as a consequence of the smearing of the kinematic
features.

Relationships between the kinemetry–based Ktot
and morpho–kinematic parameters

5. A trend is found between the Ktot and the in-
frared luminosity LIR, with the most luminous objects
(ULIRGs) showing the highest total kinematic asymme-
tries. Furthermore, the luminosity value log LIR ∼ 11.4
L(cid:12) suggests that it could be considered as a threshold
value able to separate these two morphological classes.
To conﬁrm this, a sample complete in luminosity is
needed.

6. An inverse trend is derived between the Ktot and the in-
trinsic dynamical ratio v∗/σ: morphologically classiﬁed
disks show higher dynamical ratio (v∗/σ > 2) and lower
total kinematic asymmetry Ktot (< 0.14). Contrary, for
the mergers v∗/σ is lower (< 2) while Ktot is higher (>
0.14).
Our results support the ‘kinematic downsizing’ scenario
proposed by Kassin et al. (2012), where systems be-
come progressively more ordered with time as distorted
motions decrease and rotation velocities increase, where
the most massive galaxies are on average the most kine-
matically settled.

7. An interesting trend is also found between the Ktot
and the projected nuclear separation (as a proxy of the
galaxy interaction stage) along the merger process. The
smaller the nuclear separation the larger the Ktot, which
reaches its maximum value during the ‘ongoing merg-
ing phase’ (nuclear separation between the galaxies of
2–5 kpc) and then decreases during the post-coalescence
merging phase, although with a relatively large disper-
sion. Our results are in agreement with those derived in
Hung et al. (2015), who found that the merger fraction
(as a proxy of the Ktot parameter) shows a strong trend
with the galaxy interaction stage.

The robustness of the Ktot frontier determina-
tion in classifying disks and mergers

8. From our results, the kinematic frontier we derive to
distinguish ‘disks’ from ‘mergers’ is well determined.

Indeed, when type 1 (interacting) objects are included
(case I) or not (case II) in the ‘disk’ group, the derived
fractions of ‘well classiﬁed’ disks and merger in both
the cases are very akin, ∼80% and ∼100%, respectively.
This result can also conﬁrm that the ‘paired disk’ ob-
jects can actually be considered as ‘disks’ according to
their kinematic asymmetries.

9. The Ktot limit derived by Shapiro et al. (2008) (Ktot
= 0.5) to separate ‘disks’ from ‘mergers’ at high–z
is ∼ 65% larger, respectively, than the one found by
us for the whole sample (observed locally and sim-
ulated at high–z) with both the weighted and un-
weighted methods. The use of this frontier would im-
ply that the number of ‘disks’ in our sample would be
largely overestimated (classifying the 85% of the galax-
ies as ‘disk’), since only the ongoing– and some of the
post–coalescence mergers with more complex kinemat-
ics would be classiﬁed as ‘mergers’. This, together with
the eﬀects of resolution on high–z samples, suggests that
the fraction of disks at high–z inferred from similar kine-
matic criteria may be overestimated.

10. The value of the frontier derived using the kinemetry–
based methods strongly depends on the morphological
classiﬁcation which is key when analyzing high–z SGFs.
Such systems may be dominated by several mechanisms
and characterized by diﬀerent gas and dust content, stel-
lar mass and interaction stage. Thus, the combination
of high resolution morphology (such as those coming
from HST or AO–assisted imaging) along with spatially
resolved kinematics will allow one to reveal the dynam-
ical state of such systems (Neichel et al. 2008). Multi-
wavelength morphological observations are needed to
study the molecular gas phase (closely related to star
formation) as well as the stars to better constrain the
disk/merger fraction of SFGs at high–z.
