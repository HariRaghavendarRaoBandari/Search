ABSTRACT

We present a study on the dwarf lenticular galaxy MCG+08-22-082 (U141) located in the Ursa Major
cluster, which is blue centered, double cored, and has a boxy appearance. Using publicly available data
from the SDSS, we perform an analysis of structural and stellar population properties of the galaxy
and the cores. We ﬁnd that the light proﬁle of U141 follows an exponential law. U141 has a brightness
Mr = −16.01 mag, and an eﬀective radius Re = 1.7 kpc. The boxiness parameter, a4/a, is mostly
between 0 and −0.05 in the inner parts, reaching an extreme of about −0.1. Double cores are seen at
the center of U141 and each of these cores has a stellar mass of ∼106 M(cid:12) and the separation between
them is ∼300 pc. Optical spectroscopy of these cores shows prominent emission in Hα suggesting
ongoing star forming activities. We interpret these morphological properties to speculate that U141 is
a merger remnant of two disk galaxies. Thus, we might have caught an intermediate stage of merging
with the evidence of double cores in the center of the galaxy.

INTRODUCTION

Early-type dwarf galaxies (dEs) are the most common
galaxy type in clusters of galaxies (Jerjen & Tammann
1997). Recently, many studies of dEs have revealed that
they possess diverse substructural features such as spiral
disks, bars, nuclei and/or central star forming regions
(Jerjen et al. 2000; De Rijcke et al. 2003; Lisker et al.
2006b,a; Janz et al. 2014).

Galaxy morphologies are one of the fundamental ele-
ments to understand their underlying dynamics and as-
sembly histories. Several formation scenarios are pro-
posed that integrate the variety of observable features
of dEs. The most discussed hypothesis involves trans-
formation from late-type dwarf galaxies into dEs with
the surrounding environments playing a signiﬁcant role.
Moreover, owing to their shallow potential wells (de Blok
et al. 2008), dwarf galaxies are fragile to the environmen-
tal mechanisms. Ram pressure stripping (Gunn & Gott
1972) and harassment (Moore et al. 1998) are the most
favored mechanisms generating morphological transfor-
mation from late-type galaxies into dEs in the harsh en-
vironment. Penny et al. (2014) presented a study on an
interesting barlike dE, SA 0426-002, in the core of the
Perseus cluster. They argued that SA 0426-002 is being
tidally transformed into an early-type morphology via
galaxy harassment, as it is located near NGC 1275, the
brightest cluster galaxy.

In addition to the environmental eﬀects, morphological
transformation by merger is a generally accepted concept
for the formation of large elliptical galaxies as demon-
strated by simulations (Barnes & Hernquist 1992).
In
fact, the well known cosmology, i.e ΛCDM, predicts a
hierarchical growth of large scale structures, and it is

commonly expected that galaxies may have undergone
through several major and/or minor merging episodes.

Naab et al. (2006) performed a numerical simulation
of an idealized equal mass merger of galaxies and showed
that the ﬁnal remnant galaxies are slow rotating and
boxy, with double peaks in their center as well (see ﬁg-
ure 11 of Naab et al. 2006). Generalizing these results
indicates that boxy morphology and double cores are the
signs of mergers, which are commonly seen in large el-
liptical galaxies (Bekki & Shioya 1997; Tadhunter et al.
2012).

As an observational evidence of the mergers of dwarf
galaxies, Graham et al. (2012) presented an exotic dE,
LEDA 074886, with an overall rectangular shape. They
suggested that this galaxy is fast rotating (vrot/σ ∼ 1.4)
which is in accordance with the results of merging of two
disk galaxies (Hoﬀman et al. 2010). A comprehensive
analysis by Janz et al. (2014) of structural parameters of
a large sample of dEs in the Virgo cluster reveals that
disks in low mass galaxies might be associated with both
disky and boxy appearances. They suggest that boxy
shapes might be able to be formed by encounters and
mergers of dwarf galaxies. A dE with a rectangular shape
and double cores has not been reported yet, and in this
paper we report one of such galaxies.

Our focus is on MCG+08-22-082, a galaxy having a
unique morphology with a boxy isophote, a blue center,
and double cores (Figures 1 and 2). This galaxy is a
member of the Ursa Major cluster (Trentham & Tully
2002; Karachentsev et al. 2013; U141, Pak et al. 2014).
Hereafter, we refer to MCG+08-22-082 as U141 for con-
venience. U141 is classiﬁed as a dwarf lenticular galaxy
with an absolute magnitude of Mr = −16.012 mag. The
Ursa Major cluster comprises diﬀuse environments with

2 Distance modulus of the Ursa Major cluster is (m − M )0 =

31.20 (d = 17.4 Mpc) (Tully & Courtois 2012).

low velocity dispersion, and thus the tidal interactions
and merging between members can occur more frequently
than in dense clusters (Mamon 1990). We will investi-
gate a plausible mechanism forming this galaxy using
multi-band photometric and spectroscopic data.

We present a detailed structural and stellar popula-
tion analysis of U141 using the publicly available archival
data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the
Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX). This paper is or-
ganized as follows. Section 2 describes the data adopted
from the SDSS and how we performed surface photome-
try and spectral analysis. Our conclusion and discussion
on the evolutionary path of U141 is given in section 3.

2. THE DATA AND ANALYSIS

2.1. Surface Photometry

To perform detailed surface photometry on U141, we
extensively use imaging from the SDSS Data Release 7
(DR7, Abazajian et al. 2009). Reduced and calibrated
CCD images were acquired from the SDSS data archive
server. These were observed in ﬁve optical bands, i.e.
u, g, r, i, and z, with a total exposure time of 54s in
each band. The pixel scale is 0.396(cid:48)(cid:48) pixel−1 and the av-
erage seeing in this ﬁeld of view is 1.2(cid:48)(cid:48) in the r-band
as we have measured from the Full Width at Half Max-
imum (FWHM) of randomly selected foreground stars.
Details of post-processing of the SDSS images are given
in Pak et al. (2014). Since sky background subtraction
in the SDSS pipeline processed images is not reliable
(Lisker et al. 2006b), we optimized the post-processing
steps to improve reliability. In this work, we use the sky
background subtracted postage images with an area of
800×800 pixels.

where µ0 is central surface brightness, h is scale-length,
and n is the S´ersic index (Graham & Driver 2005). This
process gives the values of µ0, h, and n as output. An ef-
ﬁcient curve ﬁtting code, M P F IT , which is implemented
in the IDL library has been used to obtain best ﬁt param-
eters in each band (Markwardt 2009). The inner 5(cid:48)(cid:48) is
excluded during the ﬁt to avoid the central double cores.
The eﬀective radius Re is obtained using the equation

(c), where we overlaid the contours, three-pixel smooth-
ing has been applied to enhance the signal at the outer
part of the galaxy.

Basic information on U141 is summarized in Table 1.
Brightness and the coordinates are adopted from Table
2 in Pak et al. (2014) and from the NASA/IPAC Extra-
galactic Database. Structural parameters are obtained
from surface photometry (see below). We calculate the
total star formation rate (SFR) from the FUV ﬂux mea-
sured in Pak et al. (2014) and using equation (3) from
Lee et al. (2009).

We derive a major axis light proﬁle ﬁtting the elliptical
isophotes in the images of all bands. The IRAF/ELLIPSE
(Jedrzejewski 1987) task is used for this purpose,
in
which the sky-background subtracted images were used
and unrelated foreground and background objects were
masked manually. During the ellipse ﬁtting, we ﬁx the
center, while the position angle and the ellipticity of
isophotes are allowed to vary. We provide initial values of
these isophotal parameters as returned from the Source
Extractor (SExtractor; Bertin & Arnouts 1996) pho-
tometry. We separately measure the surface brightness
proﬁles in the images of all bands using the same initial
parameters.

Figure 2 shows the results. We present the surface
brightness proﬁles of U141 in all the ﬁve ﬁlters in panel
(a), in which we overplot u-, g-, r-, i-, and z-band surface
brightness proﬁles from bottom to top. As expected,
the r-band data points have the smallest error bars, and
therefore we primarily use the r-band surface photometry
to derive the structural parameters of U141.

The observed surface brightness proﬁle µ(R) is ﬁtted

with a S´ersic function of the form given in

(cid:18) R

(cid:19)1/n

(2)
where b = 1.9992n − 0.3271, for 0.5 < n < 10, and the
eﬀective surface brightness, µe, is calculated by using

Re = bnh,

µ0 = µe − 2.5b/ ln(10)

(3)

(Graham & Driver 2005).

All the derived structural parameters in each band are
summarized in Table 2. Each column presents (1) band,
(2) central surface brightness, (3) eﬀective surface bright-
ness, (4) eﬀective radius, and (5) S´ersic index. The errors
of surface brightness proﬁles are measured from the rms
scatter of intensity along the ellipse ﬁt. These errors
are used as weight values to calculate the errors of the
ﬁtted S´ersic parameters using M P F IT package which
measures errors from the covariance metrics. We ﬁnd
that U141 has a nearly exponential light proﬁle with the
best ﬁt S´ersic index equal to 1.3 for the r-band. This
is consistent with the results from other bands. The r-
band eﬀective radius is Re = 21.31(cid:48)(cid:48) (1.7 kpc3), which
is consistent with the results from the g- and i-bands,
but is much larger compared to the values from the u-
and z-bands. Eﬀective surface brightness in the r-band
is µe,r = 25.54 mag arcsec−2.
For the purpose of obtaining the radial g− r color pro-
ﬁle, we match the image quality in the g- and r-bands.
FWHM estimates of the g- and r-bands are 1.3(cid:48)(cid:48) and
1.2(cid:48)(cid:48), respectively. We therefore degrade the r-band im-
age by smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of 0.6 pixels.
We consider the point between the cores as the photo-
metric center. Finally, we derive the color distribution
from the azimuthally averaged light proﬁles in the g- and
r-bands. In Figure 2 (b), we show the g − r color proﬁle
of U141; here we can clearly see that, as in the color im-
age, a positive color gradient is eminent where ∆(g − r)

is 0.18 mag within the Re. The color proﬁle becomes
nearly ﬂat beyond 10(cid:48)(cid:48) with an average g − r color index
of 0.6 mag.

We show the variation of the isophotal parameters of
position angle (PA), ellipticity (e) and boxiness parame-
ter (a4/a) in the third, fourth and ﬁfth panels of Figure
2, respectively. All three parameters remain nearly un-
changed beyond 10(cid:48)(cid:48) where the average values of PA and
ellipticity are 79◦ and 0.5, respectively. The ELLIPSE
task measures isophote deviations and gives amplitudes
using a Fourier series shown in

I(θ) = I0 + Σ

∞
n=1(An cos nθ + Bn sin nθ),

(4)

where θ is the azimuthal angle and I0 is the average in-
tensity over the ellipse.

(cid:112)

The An and Bn, given by the ELLIPSE task, are the
higher order Fourier coeﬃcients divided by the semi-
major axis length, a, and the local gradient along the
major axis (Hao et al. 2006). As a boxiness parameter,
(1 − e)A4 (see Hao et al. (2006);
a4/a is deﬁned as
Milvang-Jensen & Jørgensen (1999) for details) where
A4 from the ELLIPSE task is a measure of the isophotal
deviation from an ellipse4. Negative and positive values
of a4/a mean boxy and disky shape of a galaxy, respec-
tively (Bender et al. 1988, Hao et al. 2006). In Figure 2
(e), a4/a of U141 shows a variation from −0.15 to 0.15.
Interestingly, while the value of a4/a is mostly between
0 and 0.05 within 10(cid:48)(cid:48), even reaching about −0.1 at the
extreme, the average value of a4/a beyond 10(cid:48)(cid:48) radius
is −0.06. This implies that the outer isophotes of U141
might show boxy shapes.

2.2. Properties of cores

4 A4 is the Fourier coeﬃcient used in the studies of bars, where

it is always positive (see, e.g., Laurikainen et al. 2006).

At ﬁrst glance U141 is a typical blue centered dE, as
Lisker et al. (2006a) have identiﬁed in the Virgo cluster.
But, interestingly, a careful inspection of the SDSS im-
ages shows that U141 possesses double cores and they
are notably bluer than the main body of the galaxy (see
Section 3.1 for the discussion on this in the context of
the merger scenario).

To perform photometry and measure the stellar masses
of these cores, we subtracted a smooth galaxy model that
we had obtained from surface photometry in the previous
section. In the SDSS r-band image, the centroids of the
two cores are separated by 10 pixels, corresponding to a
physical separation of 3.9(cid:48)(cid:48) = 312 pc. While we consider
the center of the ﬁtted ellipses in the outer part (i.e.
beyond 10(cid:48)(cid:48)) to be the global photometric center of the
galaxy, this does not coincide with the positions of either
of the two cores.

We show the galaxy subtracted residual image in Fig-
ure 3, in which the cores are named as A (east) and B
(west). We perform aperture photometry to measure the
total ﬂux. During the measurement of the ﬂux of each
core, we ﬁrst mask the other and use a circular aper-
ture of 10 pixels. The sky background is selected from
an annulus of 11 pixels and 15 pixels as the inner and
outer radii, respectively. We ﬁnd that the two cores are
similar in brightness, but the core A is slightly bluer and
more compact than B; we can also see this in the SDSS
color image (Figure 1 (a)). Using the formula provided
by Bell et al. (2003), we derive rough stellar masses of
these cores from the r-band luminosities and g− r colors.
The results are listed in Table 3. Since the mass to light
ratio obtained from Bell et al. (2003) heavily depends on
color only, the redder core B seems more massive than
core A. However, these mass estimates should be taken
as rough estimates, not exact values.

We ﬁnd that the SDSS has targeted U141 twice placing
the ﬁber of each core in diﬀerent epochs. The spectrum
of B is already available in DR7 and later DR12 adds that
of A. The SDSS spectra are obtained with ﬁbers of 3(cid:48)(cid:48)
diameter. We show positions of ﬁbers on U141 in Figure
3, where the crosses represent the positions and circles
the ﬁber area.
It seems that the ﬁbers are fairly well
centered at the centroid of the cores. There is almost no
overlap between them but given the typical seeing of ∼1(cid:48)(cid:48)
of SDSS observations, it is likely that a slight fraction of
ﬂuxes might have been exchanged.

The optical spectra of these cores exhibit the emission
lines of typical H ii regions (Figure 4). The radial ve-
locities of the A and B cores are 781 ± 2.6 km s−1 and
778 ± 8.8 km s−1, respectively. This diﬀerence is well
within the uncertainty of the radial velocities as mea-
sured from the SDSS spectroscopy. The emission line
ﬂuxes are measured after subtracting the stellar absorp-
tion features using the publicly available IDL code GAN-
DALF (Sarzi et al. 2006) and the stellar templates of
Tremonti et al. (2004).

Gas-phase oxygen abundances, 12 + log(O/H), for the
two cores were estimated using two methods described,
among others, by Marino et al. (2013); the so-called
N2 and O3N2 methods. The N2 method only consid-
ers the line ratio between Hα and [N ii] while the O3N2
method uses a combination of the line ratios Hα/[N ii]
and [O iii]/Hβ. We obtained 12 + log(O/H) = 8.4(8.3)

and 8.6(8.5) dex from the N2(O3N2) method for the A
and B cores, respectively. The systematic error of these
two methods is 0.2 dex. We measure the star formation
rate from Hα emission ﬂux and calibration provided by
Kennicutt (1998). For the A and B cores, the star for-
mation rates are 0.7 × 10−3 and 0.1 × 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1,
respectively. The sum of the star formation rates in the
two cores derived from Hα emissions is nearly half of the
global value derived from total FUV emission. The Hα
equivalent widths are 83 ˚A and 6 ˚A for the A and B
cores, respectively.

2.3. Environments

Figure 5 presents the spatial distribution of galaxies in
the Ursa Major cluster ﬁeld and neighbors of U141 to
show their environments. U141 is located in the middle
of the cluster (Figure 5 (a)) but not in the dense region.
Within the sky projected radius of 100 kpc, there are
only two close neighbors, UGC 7176 (U138) and NGC
4157 (U140). U141 has relative radial velocities of 131
km s−1 and 207 km s−1 to UGC 7176 and NGC 4157,
respectively. NGC 4157 is a bright S0 galaxy and UGC
7176 is a dwarf irregular galaxy with magnitudes Mr =
−20.30 and −15.47 mag, respectively.

We carefully inspect the SDSS r-band image of this re-
gion to search for any tidal features (i.e., stellar stream or
ﬁlament) that may have originated from the past inter-
action among galaxies. Within the detection limit of the
SDSS, no such feature is observed around either U141 or
its neighboring galaxies (Kreckel et al. 2012; Kim et al.
2012; Hirschmann et al. 2013).

3. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In this work we have presented a study of structure
and stellar populations study in a double core boxy dwarf
galaxy, U141. U141 is a member of the Ursa Major clus-
ter, located near the bright S0 galaxy NGC 4157. Using
imaging and spectroscopy data available from the SDSS,
we have performed an analysis of structural and stel-
lar population properties. The absolute magnitude and
the eﬀective radius of U141 are Mr = −16.01 mag and

brightness proﬁle is nearly exponential and the outer
isophotes are clearly boxy, as all the values of a4/a at
radius larger than 10(cid:48)(cid:48) are negative.

Overall, the central region of U141 is bluer than the
outer part, and in the central area we also identify two
distinct compact star-forming cores. These two cores are
clearly visible in both of the SDSS r-band and color im-
ages. The east core, A, shows strong star forming activ-
ity, which is consistent with the prominent emission of
Hα with equivalent width of 83 ˚A. Each core has stellar
mass of ∼106 M(cid:12).
Using the GALEX UV and the SDSS optical data, we
carry out a multi-wavelength study of U141. We perform
two-component SED ﬁtting (as described in Jeong et al.
2007) based on the simple stellar population model of
Bruzual & Charlot (2003). We ﬁnd that U141 is com-
posed of young (∼0.8 Gyr) and old (∼12 Gyr) compo-
nents that comprise ∼3% and ∼97% of total mass, re-
spectively. The 3% fraction of the young population is
signiﬁcantly larger than that of the total core mass that
we have derived from diﬀerent methods. The total core
mass amounts to only ∼0.4% of the total stellar mass of
U141 (∼ 3.9 × 108 M(cid:12)). To explore further, we visually
examine the optical u and UV images and we notice that
the young stellar populations are not only concentrated
in the cores but also spread much farther out, although
it seems that the cores contain a signiﬁcantly larger frac-
tion. This may explain the observed discrepancy in the
young stellar populations in cores and the galaxy over-
all. However, it should be noted that the stellar mass
calculation using very limited photometric data points is
highly uncertain and model dependent.

3.1. A Possible Merger Origin

With the discovery of morphological diversity in dEs
by Lisker et al. (2006b,a), our understanding on the for-
mation and evolution of these low mass objects has be-
come even more complicated. A considerable fraction
of dEs possess substructural features (i.e., blue center,
disk spiral arm, bar and/or central nucleus), and such
substructural varieties are inexplicable with a single for-
mation scenario of dEs. The role of the environment,
which can act in several diﬀerent ways (see the reviews
Boselli & Gavazzi 2006; Lisker 2009), has been frequently
discussed in the literature. Although the strong environ-
mental eﬀects could be thought as the role for various
morphologies of dwarf galaxies, another channels for the
morphological diversity in dEs could be suggested.

The star clusters or super star clusters in a galaxy
could be observed as double cores, just like those em-
bedded in U141. It is possible that the star clusters go
into the centers of galaxies due to the dynamical friction
and the sizes of the cores and star clusters might be sim-
ilar. Mean eﬀective radii of star clusters are 3 − 5 pc
(0.038(cid:48)(cid:48) − 0.063(cid:48)(cid:48)) at the distance of the Ursa Major clus-
ter (Seth et al. 2006). This size can not be resolved in our
SDSS r-band image with seeing of 1.2(cid:48)(cid:48). In the r-band,
the FWHMs of cores A and B are 8.1(cid:48)(cid:48) and 4.3(cid:48)(cid:48), respec-
tively. The FWHMs of double cores are large enough to
be resolved at the distance of the Ursa Major cluster,
so these cores might not be star clusters or super star
clusters.

Another possibility for the origin of the double cores

is that they could be star forming H ii regions. Gu
et al. (2006) presented two distinct nuclei of IC 225 in
the oﬀ-center region, which is somewhat similar to what
we observed in U141. They suggested that the oﬀ-center
nucleus is originated by star forming activity with high
metallicity (12 + log(O/H) = 8.98). The metallicity mea-
sured in this region is higher than that (12 + log(O/H)
= 8.2) calculated by using the luminosity-metallicity re-
lation of isolated dwarf galaxies (Duc et al. 2004) at
MB = −17.14. In the case of U141 (MB ∼ −15.035), the
cores of U141 have higher metallicities (12 + log(O/H) =
8.4 and 8.6) than that (12 + log(O/H) ∼ 8.0) of isolated
galaxies in the luminosity-metallicity relation (Duc et al.
2004). This implies that the cores might be star forming
H ii regions.
Debattista et al. (2006) found double nuclei with age of
∼8 Gyr at the center of dwarf elliptical galaxy VCC 128,
of which absolute magnitude is MB = −15.5. To main-
tain the observed conﬁguration of double nuclei with a
small separation of ∼32 pc, they introduced a super mas-
sive black hole without any direct or indirect evidences.
If the double nuclei are nuclear disks surrounding a super
massive black hole with ∼ 106 M(cid:12), they would be a sta-
ble, long-lived conﬁguration and would account for the
old populations. In the case of U141, the separation of
the double cores is 312 pc. This is much larger than the
Bondi radius (14 pc) of a black hole (Bondi 1952) where
the matters are gravitationally bound to and are being
accreted into the black hole assuming that the mass of the
black hole is ∼ 106 M(cid:12) in the middle of the double cores
and a relative velocity of ∼25 km s−1 between the black
hole and cores which is velocity dispersion of a galaxy
with MB ∼ −15.0 (De Rijcke et al. 2005). The separa-
tion of the double cores in the central massive black hole
hypothesis is too large to accrete matter into the central
black hole. Therefore, U141 might not have a massive
black hole.

Galaxy merger could be a possible mechanism to form
the double cores. Double cores are frequently observed in
giant early-type galaxies with disturbed features (Sheen
et al. 2012; Nesci et al. 2015). Dwarf galaxies with double
cores are rarely reported. It seems that U141 is located
in a good condition to have a merge possible, i.e., in a
low-density cluster with a low velocity dispersion.

Boxy isophote dEs are rarely observed. LEDA 074886
is an almost rectangular-shaped dE, while its surface
brightness proﬁle is exponential. Graham et al. (2012)
suggested a hybrid formation scenario that LEDA 074886
might have emerged through both dissipational merger
in the center and dry merger in the outer part of the
galaxy. Kazantzidis et al. (2011) performed simulations
of formation of dEs by merging of two dwarf disk galax-
ies. According to their results, boxy morphology of U141
could be formed by both major and minor mergers.

The fact that U141 shows a mixture of features with
double cores and boxy-shaped morphology in the Ursa
Major cluster (low cluster velocity dispersion and no in-
tra cluster medium) prefers to dwarf-dwarf merger for the

of

formation of U141. Although the double cores in U141
might be explained with star forming H ii regions, exis-
tence of the H ii regions do not simultaneously explain
the boxy shapes. In the case of a merger of dwarf galax-
ies, double cores and boxy shape of U141 can be simulta-
neously explained. Although it is expected that low mass
galaxies experience less merging events (De Lucia et al.
2006), examples of dwarf-dwarf merger have been multi-
plying signiﬁcantly in recent studies (Mart´ınez-Delgado
et al. 2012; Amorisco et al. 2014; Paudel et al. 2015).

During the merger of galaxies, gas supply toward the
center becomes extremely eﬃcient, producing a central
star burst (Bekki 2008; Peeples et al. 2009). When the
merger-induced central star burst is triggered, the galaxy
will look like a blue centered galaxy. In addition, it is ex-
pected that the central gas metallicity will be lower than
that expected from the luminosity-metallicity relation,
due to the pure gas infall (Peeples et al. 2009). Star for-
mation rate also will be larger than that expected from
the SFR-mass relation (Peeples et al. 2009). However,
U141 has higher gas metallicities (12 + log(O/H) = 8.4
and 8.6) for the two cores and lower star formation rate
(log SFR [M(cid:12) yr−1] ∼ −2.85) than the expected metal-
licity (12 + log(O/H) ∼ 8.0) and the star formation rate
estimated from the SFR-mass relation (log SFR ∼ −1.6),
respectively. U141 is similar to the galaxies with high gas
metallicity and low SFR found by Peeples et al. (2008).
They predicted that those are galaxies with depleted H i
compared to the abundance of oxygen in the ﬁnal stages
of their star forming activities. Within this context, we
suspect that U141 might be formed from a merger be-
tween H i depleted galaxies having overall low star for-
mation rate in the end of their star formation activity.
During the merger of these H i depleted progenitors, the
star formation eﬃciency of U141 might has been low and
gas metallicity been high.

If U141 is formed by a merger, we can roughly esti-
mate the time scale of merging between two galaxies for
which we assume a mass ratio of 2:1 between primary
and secondary based on the mass ratio of the two cores.
We use the equation (4) from Jiang et al. (2008) for the
dynamical friction time scale, where the secondary starts

7

to merge from the virial radius of the primary with an
elliptical orbit ( = 0.5) and a relative radial velocity of
158 km s−1 which is the velocity dispersion of the Ursa
Major cluster. The virial radius is converted from the
eﬀective radius using the relation between virial radius
and eﬀective radius (Kravtsov 2013). We obtain a merg-
ing timescale of ∼1 Gyr for the two progenitors to arrive
at the separation of ∼ 312 pc and the relative radial ve-
locity of ∼ 3 km s−1. In the end, the cores will be merged
within ∼250 Myr.

Nevertheless, the shallow SDSS images may prevent
us from excluding other possible scenarios, particularly
tidal interaction with other nearby galaxies. We cannot
entirely rule out the possibility that U141 is in the stage
of ongoing interaction with either UGC 7176 or NGC
4157. Given the very interesting nature of U141, we fur-
ther suggest that a deep imaging and kinematic study
would be extremely valuable.
