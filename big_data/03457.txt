Abstract. We explore systematically a new class of two-phase equations of state (EoS) for hybrid stars that
is characterized by three main features : (1) stiﬀening of the nuclear EoS at supersaturation densities due
to quark exchange eﬀects (Pauli blocking) between hadrons, modelled by an excluded volume correction,
(2) stiﬀening of the quark matter EoS at high densities due to multiquark interactions and (3) possibility
for a strong ﬁrst order phase transition with an early onset and large density jump. The third feature
results from a Maxwell construction for the possible transition from the nuclear to a quark matter phase
and its properties depend on the two parameters used for (1) and (2), respectively. Varying these two
parameters one obtains a class of hybrid EoS that yields solutions of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ
(TOV) equations for sequences of hadronic and hybrid stars in the mass-radius diagram which cover the full
range of patterns according to the Alford-Han-Prakash classiﬁcation following which a hybrid star branch
can be either absent, connected or disconnected with the hadronic one. The latter case often includes a tiny
connected branch. The disconnected hybrid star branch, also called ”third family”, corresponds to high-
mass twin stars characterized by the same gravitational mass but diﬀerent radii. We perform a Bayesian
analysis and demonstrate that the observation of such a pair of high-mass twin stars would have a suﬃcient
discriminating power to favor hybrid EoS with a strong ﬁrst order phase transition over alternative EoS.

1 Introduction

The study of the internal composition of neutron stars is
an active ﬁeld of research which relies on astrophysical ob-
servations that allow to reﬁne theoretical models. In this
respect, the recent observations of massive neutron stars
[1, 2] have imposed important constraints on the stiﬀness
of the equation of state (EoS), and therefore on the density
ranges covered by the density proﬁles of such high-mass
compact star interiors. On the other hand radius mea-
surements are still far from being precise, with most of
the methods relying on either indirect measurements or
model dependent assumptions like, e.g., for the neutron
star atmospheres. While there is a wide range of claimed

radii starting from, e.g., ∼ 9 km [3] to ∼ 15 km [4] we will
proceed here on the assumption that the actual radii are
large, as reported by [5, 6]. For a recent review of astro-
physical constraints on dense matter see, e.g., Ref. [7].

In this contribution, we present a Bayesian analysis
(BA) study case with a class of hybrid EoS characterized
by two parameters. The ﬁrst one stands for the baryonic
exluded volume that determines the stiﬀness of hadronic
matter at high densities. The second one is the coupling
strength for an 8-quark vector current interaction which
regulates the stiﬀness of the high-density quark matter
phase. It turns out that within the range of variation
for the excluded volume parameter there is a qualitative
change in the mass-radius relation for high-mass stars:
beyond a certain value for the excluded volume the ﬁrst
order phase transition proceeds with a suﬃciently large
jump in the energy density to cause an instability which,
thanks to the stiﬀness of the quark matter phase at high
densities goes over to a stable sequence of hybrid stars,
the so-called ”third family” of compact stars. In this sit-
uation, the conditions are fulﬁlled for the high-mass twin
phenomenon, where stars on the high-mass end of the sec-

ond family of purely hadronic neutron stars are degenerate
in mass with their twin stars on the lower mass part of the
third family of hybrid stars bearing a quark matter core,
see [13] and references therein. For a recent classiﬁcation
of stable hybrid star sequences under generic conditions
for the EoS, see Ref. [14]. We note that the high-mass
twin phenomenon is quite substantially based on a stiﬀ-
ening of both, the hadronic and the quark matter EoS
towards higher densities; it is not obtained within a sys-
tematic parameter scan of hadronic vs. NJL quark matter
EoS [15] which lacks additional stiﬀening eﬀects as those
introduced in Ref. [13].

This possibility of high-mass twin stars is of great im-
portance not only due to the possibility of identiﬁcation
of a critical endpoint in the QCD phase diagram [16,17]
but also because it provides a solution to several issues
discussed in [18]: the hyperon puzzle [19], the masquerade
problem [20] and the reconﬁnement case [21,22]. More-
over, the transition between twin stars bears an energy
reservoir [23] that qualiﬁes it as a possible engine for most
energetic explosive astrophysical phenomena like gamma-
ray bursts and fast radio bursts or play a role in con-
tributing to the complex mechanism of core collapse su-
pernova explosions. The present BA in the restricted two-
dimensional parameter space of the new hybrid EoS per-
formed with the modern high mass and large radius priors
will give an answer to the question whether the high-mass
twin star case is preferable over the connected hybrid star
branch alternative.

2 New class of quark-hadron EoS for hybrid
stars

In this study we consider hybrid neutron stars that are
composed of hadronic matter and might undergo a phase
transition to quark matter in their cores if parameter val-
ues of the models physically allow for it. In this way both
pure hadronic and hybrid star conﬁgurations with physi-
cal properties determined by ﬁxed parameter values shall
be faced against observational data for model descrimi-
nation. The EoS description is presented in the following
subsections.

2.1 Hadronic EoS with excluded volume corrections

The description of hadronic matter in terms of pointlike
hadrons with appropriately chosen interactions has to be
limited to the low density region where eﬀects of the ﬁ-
nite size of hadrons (due to their compositeness) can be
neglected. In the high density region, however, the quark
substructure of nucleons requires antisymmetrization of
the many-nucleon wave function w.r.t. quark exchange
among them, leading to the Pauli blocking eﬀect in the
EoS. This eﬀect is expected to happen as density increases
beyond saturation density and can be viewed as a precur-
sor of quark delocalization as the equivalent of the quark
deconﬁnement transition [8] Pauli blocking will be inten-
siﬁed by the simultaneous partial chiral restoration [9].

The resulting consequences for the EoS can be mimicked
by adopting excluded volume corrections to any purely
hadronic EoS.

The excluded volume correction is applied at suprasat-
uration densities and has the eﬀect of stiﬀening the EoS
without modifying any of the experimentally well con-
strained properties below and around saturation nsat =
0.16 fm−3, the density in the interior of atomic nuclei. We
introduce the the available volume fraction ΦN for the
motion of nucleons at a given density n as [10]
if n ≤ nsat
exp[−v|v|(n − nsat)2/2] , if n > nsat ,

(cid:26) 1 ,

ΦN =

(1)

with v = 16πr3
N /3 as the van-der-Waals excluded vol-
ume corresponding to a nucleon hard-core radius rN . The
mathematical form of (1) with positive (negative) values
for v leads to a stiﬀening (softening) of the original EoS.
We shall consider only positive values of excluded volume
in this work and introduce for them the dimensionless pa-
rameter p = 10 × v[fm3], taking values between p = 0 and
p = 80.

For the hadronic part of the neutron star EoS we will
consider here the density dependent relativistic meanﬁeld
EoS named ”DD2” [25] (which is rather stiﬀ) and the
slightly softer EoS ”DD2F” which fulﬁlls the ﬂow con-
straint from heavy-ion collision experiments [26]. This ﬂow
constraint version of the DD2 EoS is obtained by multiply-
ing the density dependent meson-nucleon couplings Γi(n)
of the DD2 model [25] for n > nsat with the functions
gi(n), where i = ω, σ. These functions are deﬁned as

gω(n) =

1 + α−xs
1 + α+xs =

1

gσ(n)

,

(2)

where x = n/nsat − 1 and α± = k(1 ± r), with the pa-
rameter values being adjusted to k = 0.04, r = 0.07 and
s = 2.25.

For both these EoS we shall adopt a variation of the nu-
clear symmetry energy as introduced in [12] in the context
of the description of neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei.
The symmetry energy Es(n) is deﬁned as the diﬀerence in
the energy per nucleon between pure neutron matter and
symmetric matter in a uniform, inﬁnite system. In RMF
models the isovector ρ meson usually represents the only
contribution to the isospin dependence of the interaction.
Following [12] we use here three parametrizations for the
density-dependent ρ meson coupling

Γρ(n) = Γρ(nsat) exp(−αρx) ,

(3)

corresponding to a ”soft”, ”medium” and ”stiﬀ” symmetry
energy, see Table 2.1.

It turns out that Es(n) has a direct impact on the neu-
tron star radius, in particular for the low-mass stars like
star (B) of the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039(B) [27],
thus aﬀecting the compactness and binding energy, im-
portant observables for our analysis in this work. We have
hereby deﬁned a family of six EoS which we label accord-
ing to their symmetry energy functionals as DD2, DD2-,

2.2 Quark matter EoS with multi-quark interactions

The EoS in the high density phase is obtained from a
NJL model with multiquark interactions [13,28]. The La-
grangian for two quark ﬂavors, q = (u, d) is deﬁned as
L = ¯q(i∂µγµ − m)q + µu ¯uγ0u + µd

¯dγ0d + L4 + L8 , (4)

where µf are the chemical potentials of ﬂavor qf and m is
the current mass. The interaction terms are

While the NJL model has additional interactions to com-

ponents that condense at ﬁnite density are shown. Within
the mean-ﬁeld approximation the thermodynamic poten-
tial is found

function of the baryon chemical potential µB = 2µd + µu.
The total energy density of the system is

ε = −Pq − Pe + nuµu + µdnd + neµe .

2.3 Phase transition: Maxwell construction

In our study we consider that compact stars might un-
dergo a ﬁrst order phase transition to quark matter. The
transition point is determined by enforcing the Gibbs con-
ditions: both the pressure and chemical potential should
have the same value in both hadronic and quark matter
phases. Whether the resulting compact star will be a hy-
brid or a pure hadronic will depend on having these con-
ditions fulﬁlled at densities lower than the central density
of the most massive star of each EoS sequence.

A systematic analysis is performed by varying the EoS
parameters both in the hadronic and the quark phase as
shown in ﬁgure 1. This has important consequences for the
compactness of the neutron star as well as for the possible
existence of a disconnected branch of hybrid stars (”third
family”) in the mass-radius diagram.

2.4 Mass-radius relations for hybrid EoS

Once the equation of state of neutron star matter is de-
ﬁned, the structure and global properties of compact stars
are obtained by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ
(TOV) equations [36,37]

3 Bayesian analysis for Compact Stars

Bayesian methods have proven to be a poweful technique
for model descrimination and parameter descrimination.
In a primer Bayesian study performed by Steiner et al.
[35] the luminosity of expanding photospheric radius ex-
tracted for burst sources has been used to constrain a
combined mass-radius relationship. However, this method
is problematic, in particular because of the unknown stel-
lar atmosphere composition, uncertainties in the distance
to the source, the bias of the parabolic M-R constraint
with the shape of stellar sequences in the M-R diagram
for typical EoS and last but not least due to unknown de-
tails of the burst mechanism. In this work we do BA as well
but we implement diﬀerent observables which will be used
as constraints: the highest measured mass [2], a radius
measurement [5] and a gravitational mass vs. baryonic
mass determination by Podsiadlowski et al. [29]. These
constraints were already included in our earlier Bayesian
analyses, e.g., of Refs. [33,34,40]. We will describe the
Bayesian method and the chosen constraints in the fol-
lowing subsections.

3.1 Bayesian analysis technique

We start by deﬁning a vector of free parameters −→π =
{p, η4}, which correspond to all the possible models with
or without phase transition from nuclear to quark matter
using the EoS described above. The way we sample these
parameters is

−→π i =(cid:8)p(k), η4(l)

(cid:9) ,

(15)
where i = 0 . . . N − 1 with N = N1 × N2 such that
i = N2 × k + l and k = 0 . . . N1 − 1, l = 0 . . . N2 − 1,
with N1 and N2 being the total number of parameters
p(k) and η4(l), respectively. After integration of the TOV
equation each EoS model will provide estimations for NS
properties that we shall use for Bayesian analysis. Thus,
these results allow us to use diﬀerent neutron star obser-
vations in order to determine the probability that a given
EoS fulﬁls the observational constraints. Our goal is to

ﬁnd the set of most probable −→π i matching the above con-
we propose that a priori each vector of parameters −→π i
have the same probability, P (−→π i) = 1/N , for all i.

straints using the BA technique. For initializing the BA

The necessary boundary conditions to solve these equa-
tions are picking up a central energy density εc = ε(r = 0)
and a central pressure Pc = P (r = 0) at r = 0. The inte-
gration is carried out from the center of the star up to the
distance r = R where the pressure vanishes P (r = R) = 0,
deﬁning the radius R, the mass M = M (R) and the

3.2 Mass constraint

We describe the error for the event EA of a mass mea-
surement of the high-mass pulsar PSR J0348+0432 [2]
with a normal distribution N (µA, σ2
A), where the mean
value of the mass is µA = 2.01 M(cid:12) and the variance is

(16)

For the selection of the EoS with diﬀerent symmetry ener-
gies we consider as an observational constraint the proper-
ties of the star B in the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039(B)
[27] Following [29], the evolution of this object based on
the hypothesis that the neutron star is born in a super-
nova collapse after electron capture instability of an O-
Ne-Mg star. This method allows us to estimate the mass
of the progenitor core, being approximately the baryon
mass of the new-born neutron star. The measured neutron
star gravitational mass is MG = 1.249 M(cid:12), with error-bar
∆M = ±0.001 M(cid:12), while from the evolution model the
baryon mass is expected to be µB = 1.366 M(cid:12) with sta-
tistical uncertainty σM = 0.003 M(cid:12), see the red boxes in
Fig. 3. Meanwhile we know a second object of this kind,
the low-mass neutron star companion of PSR J1756-2251
[30] with MG = 1.249 ± 0.007 M(cid:12) which, if it underwent
the same evolutionary history as PSR J0737-3039(B) and
originated from an O-Ne-Mg star by an electron capture
supernova, then it should have the same baryon mass,
which would be rather troublesome as none of the known

We consider here a very promising technique to measure
radii of neutron stars that is based on the pulse phase re-
solved X-ray spectroscopy which properly accounts for the
system geometry of a radio pulsar. This radius measure-
ment gives µB = 15.5 km and σB = 1.5 km for PSR J0437-
4715 [5]. Moreover, Hambaryan et al. [6] have also reported
compatible radius measurements for RXJ 1856.5-3754.

We compute the conditional probability of the event
EB that the measured radius of the neutron star corre-

sponds to the model with −→π i as

P (EB |−→π i ) = Φ(Ri, µB, σB) .

neutron star EoS candidates would explain such a large
gravitational binding energy, see the blue boxes in Fig. 3.
There are two ways out of this dilemma. Either the mass
measurement should get corrected upwards or there is an-
other mechanism to create a low-mass neutron star in a
binary system which would work for lower baryon masses,
such as the so-called ”ultra-stripped supernovae” [31]. Re-
cently, Suwa et al. [32] demonstrated in a simulation the
formation of a neutron star with MB = 1.35 M(cid:12) from
such a scenario. Conversely, also PSR J0737-3039(B) could
be formed this way. Therefore, we derive from the above
discussion the following constraint. From the two mea-
sured neutron star masses discussed above we take the
mean value MG = 1.24 M(cid:12), with the error-bar ∆M =
±0.01 M(cid:12), and from both alternative evolution models
we take the mean baryon mass to be µB = 1.36 M(cid:12) with
the error-bar ∆M = ±0.01 M(cid:12) (see the grey box in Fig. 3;
the statistical uncertainty is taken to be σM = ∆M/3 =
0.0033 M(cid:12).

We compute the conditional probability of the event
EP that the assumed baryon mass is reproducible in the

model with parameters −→π i given by normal distribution
between the masses described by MB = MB(MG;−→π i)

with mean value µB. So, using the model dependance

the probability to fulﬁll the constraint can be calculated
from the normal distribution function for that MB val-
ues, which are in the area corresponding to the observed

gravitational mass range MG ± ∆M :

P (EP |−→π i ) = Φ(MB(MG + ∆M ;−→π i), µB, σM )

− Φ(MB(MG − ∆M ;−→π i), µB, σM ). (19)

In the plots of results we show the 1σ-range of MB values
as a box on the MG ⊗ MB plane.

3.5 Fictitious radius measurement constraints

To ﬁnd out the best suggestion for future observations,
which will be powerful for the model discrimination we
employ ﬁctitious radius measurement constraints. For our
”experiment” we choose the two known objects with well
measured high masses: PSR J0348+0432 [2] and PSR J1614−
2230 [1]. We assume that the possible radii of these ob-
jects will be diﬀerent and in the resolution range ∆R. The
masses of the objects are measured MGA = 2.01 M(cid:12), with
error-bar ∆MGA = ±0.04 M(cid:12) and MGD = 1.94 M(cid:12), with
error-bar ∆MGD = ±0.04 M(cid:12) correspondingly for the
PSR J0348+0432 and PSR J1614-2230 pulsars. The ﬁcti-
tious radii we assumed to be RA and RD with statistical
uncertainty σRA and σRD correspondingly.

model deﬁnes dependence of the radii on masses for all

smaller radius and, therefore, PSR J1614-2230 [1] has the

larger ﬁctitious radius. Anyway, we also consider one case
(last row of Fig. 6) where the less massive pulsar has the
lower radius.

4 Results

In order to cover a relevant set of possible hybrid compact
star EoS in the pressure-energy density plane we have var-
ied the excluded parameter in the range p = 0, 5, . . . , 80
as well as the 8-quark vector current coupling in the range
η4 = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 30.

The hybrid EoS resulting from Maxwell constructions
between all combinations of hadronic and quark matter
EoS in this two-dimensional parameter space is shown in
Fig. 2 together with the corresponding NS sequences.

Note that compact star sequences in the mass-radius
plane which have a vertical branch correspond to hadronic
stars and an almost horizontal branch corresponds to hy-
brid stars with a quark matter core. The parameters are
chosen in such a range that their variation entails that
the hybrid star branch becomes disconnected from the
hadronic one due to the appearance of a set of unstable
conﬁgurations. This characterizes the appearance of high-
mass twin stars and happens in particular when varying

the the excluded volume value in all of these models. We
have already observed in [13] that increasing the η4 pa-
rameter for a ﬁxed p value corresponds to an increase of
the maximum mass, while the diﬀerence between the ra-
dius of the hybrid star and its hadronic twin decreases.
This general behaviour is preserved for any ﬁxed p.

The general behavior of the symmetry energy in each
class of EoS is to shift radius values while preserving the
maximum mass for each sequence. Even though the gen-
eral result is that the DD2F class presents lower average
radii NS than the DD2, the symmetry energy and the ex-
cluded volume can modify the average radius values. The
DD2+ class is therefore the stiﬀest EoS leading to larger
radii whereas the DD2F- shows the lowest radii by being
the softest EoS class.

A posteriori probabilities of identiﬁcation for these twin
EoS are shown in ﬁgures 4 and 5. The models with higher
probabilities correspond to the ones that predict large
radii and are associated to large excluded volume param-
eters p. The optimal value of the vector coupling strength
is η4 = 5. We note that the family of hybrid EoS acces-
sible within the given two-dimensional parameter space
describes sequences of compact stars that have a hadronic
branch and a hybrid star branch. The latter appears con-
nected to the former for not too large excluded volumina.

D. Alvarez-Castillo et al.: New class of hybrid EoS and Bayesian M-R data analysis

For suﬃciently large excluded volume parameters the com-
pact stars on the hadronic branch have radii exceeding 14
km and the phase transition proceeds with a suﬃciently
large jump in the energy density so that the hybrid star
sequence gets disconnected from the hadronic one, form-
ing a so-called ”third family”. The observation of a corre-
sponding (almost) horizontal branch in the M−R diagram
would be a clear signal for a strong ﬁrst order phase transi-
tion in the high-density neutron star EoS. Using Bayesian
analysis technique we have demonstrated that the mea-
surement of signiﬁcantly diﬀerent radii for two high-mass
compact stars (like the 2 M(cid:12) objects we already know)
would have suﬃcient discriminating power to favor a hy-
brid EoS over a purely hadronic one.

5 Conclusions

We summarize our conclusions from this study of a set of
six classes of two-parameter hybrid EoS for compact star
interiors:

1. The most probable models exhibit high-mass twin star
conﬁgurations with quite distinguishable radii, diﬀer-
ing by about 2 km.

2. The region of the most probable models in the two-
dimensional parameter space is suﬃciently narrow, cov-
ering the ranges 40 < p < 80 and 3 < η4 < 7.

3. The most probable models have a large excluded vol-
ume parameter p > 40 and a not too large vector cou-
pling strength η4 ∼ 5.

4. The existence of the horizontal branch signals a strong
ﬁrst order deconﬁnement phase transition and is a fea-
ture accessible to veriﬁcation by observation. To that
end, at least for two high-mass pulsars with masses
∼ 2 M(cid:12) (like PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0348+0432)
the radii should be measured to suﬃcient accuracy and
turn out to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent.

5. Fig. 6 shows that there are strong peaks of proba-
bilities in the parameter space, even if ﬁctitious ra-
dius measurements have quite large uncertainties with
σRA = σRD = 1.5 km, where the ”measurements” have
overlap of 5σ regions. It means that even quite uncer-
tain measurements of radii for massive pulsars could
have a strong selective power of EoS models. Cf. cases
1) and 2) which demonstrate that knowing only ei-
ther mass or radius of an object results in a constraint
which is not very robust against a possible third ob-
servational constraint, like the gravitational binding
energy.

6. When ﬁctitious radius measurements yield the smaller
radius for the object with the slightly smaller mass (see
the bottom line of Fig. 6), then the most probable value
of the excluded volume parameter is lowered from p =
80 to the moderate p ∼ 50, while the optimal stiﬀness
of the quark matter remains unchanged, η4 ∼ 5.

The next two steps in the development of the approach
are devoted to an improvement of the variability of the
dense matter EoS within a two-dimensional parameter

space embodying, e.g., also the purely hadronic case with-
out a phase transition and to mimicking the occurrence of
structures (so-called ”pasta phases”) in the phase transi-
tion region [38,39].
