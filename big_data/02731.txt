SUPPORT AND RANK VARIETIES OF TOTALLY ACYCLIC

COMPLEXES

NATHAN T. STEELE

Abstract. Support and rank varieties of modules over a group algebra of an
elementary abelian p-group have been well studied. In particular, Avrunin and
Scott showed that in this setting, the rank and support varieties are equivalent.
Avramov and Buchweitz proved an analogous result for pairs of modules over
arbitrary commutative local complete intersection rings.
In this paper we
study support and rank varieties in the triangulated category of totally acyclic
chain complexes over a complete intersection ring and show that these varieties
are also equivalent.

Introduction

The main goal of this paper is to explore a theory of support and rank varieties in
the triangulated category of totally acyclic chain complexes Ktac(R) over a complete
intersection ring R = Q/(f1, . . . , fc). In [5, 1.1], Avrunin and Scott showed that
for a module M over a group algebra of an elementary abelian p-group, its support
variety V (M ) is equivalent to its rank variety W (M ). Avramov and Buchweitz [2,
2.5] proved a similar result for pairs of modules M, N over a complete intersection
ring and they simply refer to both sets as the support variety V (M, N ) . We give
similar deﬁnitions of rank and support varieties in the category of totally acyclic
chain complexes and prove that these varieties are equal.

The proof of the equivalence of support varieties of modules over a complete
intersection ring requires a theorem that states for any pair of R-modules M, N ,
the graded R-module Ext∗
Q(M, N ) is ﬁnitely generated if and only if the graded
R[χ1, . . . , χc]-module Ext∗
R(M, N ) is ﬁnitely generated, where R[χ1, . . . , χc] is a ring
of cohomology operators. The ‘if’ direction of this theorem was proved by Avramov,
Gasharov, and Peeva [3, 4.2] and the ‘only if’ direction was proved by Gulliksen [11,
3.1] cf. [1, 2.1]. We take advantage of the triangulated structure of Ktac(R) and of
a pair of adjoint functors T : Ktac(R) → Ktac(Q) and S : Ktac(Q) → Ktac(R) to
prove a similar ﬁnite generation result for pairs of totally acyclic complexes. We
then use a slightly modiﬁed version of the proof by Avramov and Buchweitz [2, 2.5]
to prove the equivalence of varieties.

Let R be an associative ring, C and D be chain complexes of R-modules, and
f, f ′ : C → D be chain maps. We say f is homotopic to f ′ if there exist maps

If there exist maps ψ : C → D and ζ : D → C such that ψ◦ζ ∼ IdD and ζ◦ψ ∼ IdC ,
then we say C and D are homotopically equivalent and we write C ≃ D.
We denote by HomR(C, D) the set of homotopy equivalence classes of degree
zero chain maps from C to D. The complex C is called totally acyclic if each Ci is
a ﬁnitely generated free R-module, C is exact, and HomR(C, R) is exact, i.e.

H(C) = 0 = H(HomR(C, R)).

The set of totally acyclic chain complexes forms a triangulated subcategory of
the homotopy category of chain complexes. We denote this subcategory by Ktac(R)
and it has distinguished triangles of the form

−−−−→ D −−−−→ Cone(t) −−−−→ ΣC

where t is a zero degree chain map from C to D. The shift functor Σ simply moves
every module in the complex to the left, i.e (ΣiC)n = Cn−i. For simplicity we will
write ΣC = Σ1C. The diﬀerentials of the shifted complex are given by dΣiC

Complete Resolutions. Let M be an R-module and let P be a projective reso-
lution of M . A Complete Resolution of M is any totally acyclic chain complex C
such that the truncated complex C>i : ··· → Ci+2 → Ci+1 → 0 is homotopically
equivalent to P>i : ··· → Pi+2 → Pi+1 → 0 for some i.
If we let P ′ be a projective resolution of a module N and let ¯ρ0 : M → N and
¯µ0 : N → M be homomorphisms, then the comparison theorem [12, 6.16] implies
that there exist chain maps ρ : P → P ′ and µ : P ′ → P . Furthermore, any chain
map from P to P ′ lifting ¯ρ0 is homotopic to ρ and any chain map from P ′ to P
lifting ¯µ0 is homotopic to µ.

Proposition 1.1. (Avramov-Martsinkovsky [4, 5.3]) Complete resolutions are unique
up to homotopy equivalence.

The following is an alternate proof to that given by Avramov and Martsinkovsky.
Proof. If C, C′ are complete resolutions of M, N respectively, then C>i ≃ P>i and

We can set l = max(i, k) so that C>l ≃ P>l and C′

>l. Hence for any
homomorphisms ¯ρ0 : M → N and ¯µ0 : N → M with ρ : P → P ′ and µ : P ′ → P
as above, there exist chain maps γ>l : C>l → C′
>l → C>l where
γn = j′

sequence.

Thus we now have chain maps γ : C → C′ and δ : C′ → C. If M = N and
ρ0 = µ0 = IdM , then ρ ◦ µ ∼ Idp′ and µ ◦ ρ ∼ IdP . Therefore γ ◦ δ ∼ IdC and
δ ◦ γ ∼ IdC ′ , hence C ≃ C′.

2. Eisenbud and Cohomology Operators in Ktac(R)

From this point forward we will let R = Q/(f1, . . . , fc) where (Q, m, k) is a
local ring and f = f1, . . . , fc is a regular sequence in m2. We will also assume
that the residue ﬁeld k is algebraically closed. For pairs of modules over a complete
intersection ring, there are multiple equivalent methods of constructing cohomology
operators. To construct similar operators in Ktac(R), we will use Eisenbud’s [10]
method of lifting chain complex diﬀerentials to create degree 2 chain maps.

Given an R-complex C, we deﬁne eC to be a sequence of Q-free module homo-

We can also lift the maps tk and sk to Q and use the facts that (edC )2 =

We will now commute the eψ with one copy each of edC and edD and subtract like

fjetj −(edD)2 −Xj6=k

fjeψ(esj −etj) +
Taking fk(edDeτk +eτkedC ) to the left yields
fk(cid:16)eψetk − eskeψ − (edDeτk +eτkedC )(cid:17) =Xj6=k

Thus we see that

fjeψ(esj −etj) +Xj6=k

We can consider the map τk as a homotopy map so that ψ(σ2

The next two corollaries show that the tk’s are well deﬁned in Ktac(R).

Corollary 2.3. (Eisenbud [10, 1.4, 1.5]) The tk’s are uniquely determined up to
homotopy and tktj ∼ tjtk.
Corollary 2.4. If C and D are homotopically equivalent with ψ : C → D and
ζ : D → C such that ψζ ∼ IdD and ζψ ∼ IdC , then tk ∼ ζskψ and sk ∼ ψtkζ.
Proof. By Proposition 2.2, ψtk ∼ skψ and thus tk ∼ ζψtk ∼ ζskψ. Similarly
sk ∼ ψtkζ.

HomR(C, ΣiD). The grading is given by

construction to be independent of the choice of basis of (f1, . . . , fc).

Support Varieties. Avramov and Buchweitz [2, 2.1] deﬁne the support variety
V (Q, f, M, N ) of a pair of R-modules M, N to be the zero set of the annihilator of

R(M, N ) ⊗R k, i.e.

the k[χ1, . . . , χc]-module E = Li≥0
V (Q, f, M, N ) = {(b1, . . . , bc) ∈ kc|φ(b1, . . . , bn) = 0 for all φ ∈ Ann E} ∪ {0}
We will now give a similar deﬁnition in Ktac(R) by replacingLi≥0

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let R = Q/(f1, . . . , fc) where Q is a regular local ring with residue
ﬁeld k and f1, . . . , fc is a regular sequence. Also let S = R[χ1, . . . , χc] be the ring of
cohomology operators deﬁned by f1, . . . , fc. Then the support variety V (Q, f, C, D)
of a pair of complexes C, D ∈ Ktac(R) is the zero set of the annihilator of the S⊗R k-

module E =Li≥0
V (Q, f, C, D) = {(b1, . . . , bc) ∈ kc|φ(b1, . . . , bn) = 0 for all φ ∈ Ann E} ∪ {0}.
This deﬁnition is especially useful for computing examples by simply decompos-

HomR(C, ΣiD) ⊗R k. That is,

ing the diﬀerentials of C to ﬁnd the cohomology operators.

Rank Varieties. Carlson [8, 4.1] originally deﬁned the rank variety W (M ) of a
module M over a group algebra kG ∼= k[[x1, . . . , xc]]/(xp
c ) of an elementary
abelian p-group G, where p = char(k), to be the set

1, . . . , xp

W (M ) = {¯a ∈ kc|M↓k[la] is not free} ∪ {0}

where ¯a is the image of a = (a1, . . . , ac) with ai ∈ kG and la = a1x1 + ··· + acxc ∈
kG. By a theorem of Avramov [1, 7.5], the projective dimension of a module M
over the ring Qa = k[[x1, . . . , xc]]/(lp
a) is ﬁnite if and only if M is free over k[la].
Thus

W (M ) = {¯a ∈ kc| Exti

Qa (M, k) 6= 0 for inﬁnitely many i} ∪ {0}.

Avramov and Buchweitz [2, 2.5] generalize this for a pair of modules M, N over a
complete intersection ring R = Q/(f1, . . . , fc) by setting

W (Q, f, M, N ) = {¯a ∈ kc| Exti

Qa (M, N ) 6= 0 for inﬁnitely many i} ∪ {0}.

Remark. Avramov and Buchweitz refer to both V (Q, f, M, N ) and W (Q, f, M, N )
as the support variety after proving they are isomorphic.

We would like to give a similar deﬁnition for the rank variety of a pair of totally
acyclic complexes C, D in terms of the vanishing of HomQa where Qa is a complete
intersection ring intermediate to Q and R. However, totally acyclic R-complexes
C, D are not totally acyclic Qa-complexes. The following pair of adjoint triangle
functors by Bergh, Jorgensen, and Moore will allow us to go back and forth between
Ktac(R) and Ktac(Qa).

Deﬁnition 3.2. (Bergh-Jorgensen-Moore [7, 2.1]) Let R = Q/I where Q is a
Gorenstein ring and I is an ideal with proj dimQ R < ∞, and let C ∈ Ktac(R).
Then deﬁne T : Ktac(R) → Ktac(Q) by letting T C ∈ Ktac(Q) be a complete
o over Q. Given a chain map α : C → C′ in Ktac(R), we have
resolution of Im dC
o ) → Im(dC ′
o ) induced by the map α. Then T α : T C → T C′
the map u : Im(dC
is the homotopy equivalence class of the comparison map ˜u : T C → T C′. Deﬁne
S : Ktac(Q) → Ktac(R) by SD = D ⊗Q R and Sα = α ⊗Q R.
Theorem 3.3. (Bergh-Jorgensen-Moore [7, 3.1]) The triangle functors S and T
form an adjoint pair, that is, they satisfy the following property: for all C ∈ Ktac(R)
and D ∈ Ktac(Q) there exists a bijection

which is natural in each variable.

HomQ(D, T C) → HomR(SD, C)

8

NATHAN T. STEELE

Deﬁnition 3.4. Let R = Q/(f1, . . . , fc) and let C, D ∈ Ktac(R). Then the Rank
Variety W (Q, f, C, D) of a pair of complexes C, D ∈ Ktac(R) is given by
W (Q, f, C, D) = {¯a ∈ kc| HomQa (T C, ΣiT D)) 6= 0 for inﬁnitely many i > 0} ∪ {0}
where a = (a1, . . . , ac) ∈ Qc denotes some lifting of ¯a = ( ¯a1, . . . , ¯ac) ∈ kc and
Qa = Q/faQ with fa = a1f1 + ··· + acfc ∈ Q.

It is clear that V (Q, f, C, D) is an algebraic variety. However, it is not at all
obvious from the deﬁnition that W (Q, f, C, D) is a closed set. We will now spend
the next section building the tools necessary to show that V (Q, f, C, D) is the same
as W (Q, f, C, D).

4. Finite Generation

Our main goal in this section is to translate the Gulliksen and Avramov-Gasharov-
Peeva ﬁniteness theorem for Ext to the setting of totally acyclic chain complexes
using the triangulated structure of Ktac(R). The following generalization of a result
by Avramov [1, 2.3] gives a nice condition for showing the ﬁniteness of a graded
A[x]-module given the ﬁniteness of a graded A-module.

Lemma 4.1. Let A be a non-negatively graded noetherian ring and let F be a
graded A-module and E be a graded A[x]-module. Regarding F as a graded A[x]-
module by the map s : A[x] → A where s(x) = 0, graded in total degree |axn| =
|a| + n|x| for any homogeneous element a ∈ A. Let there exist graded A[x]-module
homomorphisms ψ : E → F and φ : F → E and an exact sequence of the form
−−−−→ .

−−−−→ F i+|φ|+|x|+|ψ|

x−−−−→ Ei+|φ|+|x|

ψ

−−−−→ F i

φ

−−−−→ Ei+|φ|

ψ

φ

Then F is a ﬁnitely generated graded A-module if and only if E is a ﬁnitely generated
graded A[x]-module.

Proof. First assume F is ﬁnitely generated as an A-module. Since F is noetherian,
Im(ψ) is ﬁnitely generated. Let ψ(e1), . . . , ψ(em) be its generators. Now consider
G = Ae1 + ··· + Aem as an A[x]-graded submodule of E. Now let e ∈ E. Then
ψ(e) = a1ψ(e1) + ··· + amψ(em). Thus e − (a1e1 + ··· + anen) ∈ Ker(ψ), so E ⊆
G + Ker(ψ). The opposite containment is obvious, thus E = G + Ker(ψ). But
Ker(ψ) = Im(x) = xE. Thus E = G + xE. Iterating yields

E =

xiG + xn+1E.

nXi=0

For any homogeneous element e ∈ E and for n ≫ 0, e /∈ xn+1E so we get E =
(A[x]G). Thus E is a ﬁnitely generated A[x]-module.
Now conversely assume that E is a ﬁnitely generated A[x]-module. Consider the

short exact sequence of graded A[x]-modules,

0 → E/ Ker(ψ) → F → Im(φ) → 0.

Since E is noetherian, both E/ Ker(ψ) and Im(φ) are ﬁnitely generated, so F is
ﬁnitely generated as an A[x] module. So for any f ∈ F , f = p1f1 + ··· + pnfn
where pi ∈ A[x]. But x ∈ Ann(F ), so pifi = aifi where ai ∈ A is the constant term
of pi. Thus F is ﬁnitely generated as an A module.

Remark. Since A is assumed to be non-negatively graded and |x| > 0, F i, Ei = 0
for i < 0.

We now need to construct such a sequence of Hom modules. To prove Gulliken’s
original theorem, Avramov [1, 2.1] uses a complicated homotopy construction by
Shamash and Eisenbud. However, we can instead use the triangulated structure
of Ktac(R) to create the long exact sequence. First, we will need a few tools for
handling the triangulated structure.

Given a chain complex C over the ring R = Q/(f1, ..., fc), we cannot expect that
a lifting of C to Q will itself be a complex. However, we can ﬁnd liftings of mapping
cones of the t′

is that are complexes.

Lemma 4.2. Let Q be a local ring, R = Q/(f ) where f is a nonzerodivisor. Also
let C ∈ Ktac(R) with ˜dC
C to Σ2C. Then there exists a lifting, ^Cone(t), to Q of Cone(t) such that the lifting
is a complex. Furthermore this complex is exact.

C (et ⊗Q R) is a chain map from

n =etnf so that t = σ2

n−1 ◦ ˜dC

Remark. For simplicity of notation we will refer to ^Cone(t) as C ♯.

Proof. Consider the mapping cone diﬀerential:

The above lemma gives a lifting when R = Q/(f ). However, we would like
to be able to deal with the case where R = Q/(f1, . . . , fc). We can apply an
induction argument to get a complex over Q in this case. In particular, we can
take Rk = Q/(fk, . . . , fc) so that Rk = Rk−1/(fk) and so R = R1 = R2/(f1). Now

let C ∈ Ktac(R) and lift C to R2 with (edC )2 = eu1f1. We know that the complex

Cone(u1) ∈ Ktac(R) lifts to a complex C ♯ ∈ Ktac(R2). Now we can lift this complex
to get

)2 =eu2f2 where u2 = σ2

C ♯(fu2 ⊗Q R) and u2 : C ♯ → Σ2C ♯.

But now we can consider Cone(u2) ∈ Ktac(R2) and lift it to C ♯2 ∈ Ktac(R3). We
can continue this process until we reach C ♯c ∈ Ktac(Q) with maps given by

We now have the tools to prove the main result of this section.

Theorem 4.4. Let R = Q/(f1, . . . , fc) where Q is a local noetherian ring with
HomQ(T C, ΣiT D)

f1, . . . , fc a regular sequence and let C, D ∈ Ktac(R). Then Li≥0
is ﬁnitely generated as an R-module if and only if Li≥0

generated as an R[χ1, ..., χc]-module.

HomR(C, ΣiD) is ﬁnitely

Proof. First consider the case where R = Q/(f1) where f1 is a single nonzerodivisor.
Consider the exact triangle

C → Σ2C → Cone(t1) → ΣC.

Since Ktac(R) is a triangulated category, we can apply the contravariant Hom func-
tor to the exact triangle to get the long exact sequence

··· → HomR(ΣiC, D) → HomR(Σi−1 Cone(t1), D) →
HomR(Σi+1C, D) → HomR(Σi−1C, D) → . . .

for any D ∈ Ktac(R). By Lemma 4.2

Also, by Theorem 3.3

Σi Cone(t1) ∼= SΣiC ♯ ∈ Ktac(R).

HomR(ΣiSC ♯, D) ∼= HomQ(ΣiC ♯, T D).

12

NATHAN T. STEELE

So we now have the long exact sequence

··· → HomR(ΣiC, D) → HomQ(Σi−1C ♯, T D) →

HomR(Σi+1C, D) → HomR(Σi−1C, D) → . . . .

So lastly we can apply Lemma 4.1 and ﬁnd that Li≥0
generated as an R-module if and only if Li≥0

as an R[χ]-module.

HomQ(Σ−iC ♯, T D) is ﬁnitely

HomR(Σ−iC, D) is ﬁnitely generated

Now let the statement hold for R′ = Q′/(f1, . . . , fk−1). Let R′ = Q and R =

Q/(fk). We can now apply the same argument as above to the exact triangle

C ♯k−1 → Σ2C ♯k−1 → Cone(uk) → ΣC ♯k−1

where uk is the Eisenbud operator of C ♯k−1 for k > 1 and u1 = t1. This yields
HomQ′ (Σ−iC ♯k, T D) is ﬁnitely generated as an R-module if and only if

that Li≥0
Li≥0
alent to the statement Li≥0
if and only if Li≥0

HomR(Σ−iC, D) is ﬁnitely generated as an R[χ1, . . . , χk]-module. This is equiv-

HomQ′ (C ♯k, ΣiT D) is ﬁnitely generated as an R-module

HomR(C, ΣiD) is ﬁnitely generated as an R[χ1, . . . , χk]-module.

We can now use lemma 4.3 to replace C ♯k by T C and so the theorem holds.

(cid:3)

5. Avrunin-Scott for Ktac(R)

We are now ready to show that the support variety and rank variety of a pair
of totally acyclic complexes are the same, translating the Avrunin-Scott theorem
[5, 1.1] to the setting of Ktac(R). The proof follows the same logic that Avramov
and Buchweitz [2, 2.5] use to prove a similar equivalence for the support variety of
a pair of modules over a complete intersection ring.

Theorem 5.1. Let R = Q/(f1, . . . , fc) where (Q, m, k) is a regular local ring and
f = f1, . . . , fc is a regular sequence. Then V (Q, f, C, D) = W (Q, f, C, D).
Proof. Since 0 ∈ V (Q, f, C, D), we can assume that ai 6= 0 for some i. Since f
is a regular sequence, there exists a regular sequence f ′ = f ′
c such that
f and f ′ generate the same ideal and (a1, . . . , an) = (0, . . . , 0, 1). This means
that fa = f ′
c, so we only have to show that k(0, . . . , 0, 1) ⊆ V (Q, f, C, D) if and
only if HomQa (T C, ΣiT D) 6= 0 for inﬁnitely many i. We will actually prove the
contrapositive of the statement. That is, HomQa (T C, ΣiT D) = 0 for i ≫ 0 if and
only if k(0, . . . , 0, 1) * V (Q, f, C, D).
c) and recall the notation from deﬁnition 3.1, S = R[χ1, . . . , χc]
c−1 is regular on Q′ so

HomR(C, ΣiD) ⊗R k. The sequence f ′

Let Q′ = Q/(f ′

1, . . . , f ′

1, . . . , f ′

we can consider the cohomology ring of S′ = R[χ′
sequence. By proposition 2.6, the action of χ′
and thus by mapping χ′

1, . . . , χ′

c−1] of Q′ deﬁned by this
i on E agrees with the action of χi

i to χi we can consider S′ to be a sub ring of S.

By Theorem 4.4, we know that HomQ′ (T C, ΣiT D) = 0 for i ≫ 0 if and only if
the S′-module Li≥0
HomR(C, ΣiD) is ﬁnitely generated. But by Nakayama’s lemma,
this happens if and only if E is ﬁnitely generated over S′ ⊗R k. This is equivalent

and E = Li≥0

c−1) ∼= E/E(χ1, . . . , χc−1) being ﬁnitely generated over
to E′ = E/E(χ′
(S′ ⊗R k)/(χ′
Now let R = S ⊗R k and R′ = R/(χ1, . . . , χc−1). Then rankk E′ is ﬁnite if and
only if SuppR(E′) = {(χ1, . . . , χc)}. Also since E is ﬁnitely generated over R and
E′ = E ⊗R R, we have

c−1) ∼= k.

SuppR(E′) = SuppR(E ⊗R R′) = SuppR(E)\ SuppR(R′).

This is true if and only if

Since we have Z(AnnR E) = V (Q, f, C, D), Z(AnnR R′) = k(0, . . . , 0, 1), and
Z(AnnR(E′)) = 0, the nullstellensatz implies the previous line is true if and only if

√Ann E \ √AnnR′ = (χ1, . . . , χc).
V (Q, f, C, D)\ k(0, . . . , 0, 1) = {0} ∈ kc.

So looking at the above list of if and only if statements, we now have
HomQ′(T C, ΣiT D) = 0 for i ≫ 0 if and only if k(0, . . . , 0, 1) * V (Q, f, C, D). (cid:3)

6. Properties of Support/Rank Varieties

We will now prove a few basic results about support/rank varieties in Ktac(R).
The same properties hold for support varieties of modules over a complete inter-
section ring and the proofs are similar [2, 5.6] cf. [6, 2.2].

The ﬁrst theorem provides a nice analogue to Dade’s Lemma [9] for Ktac(R).

Theorem 6.1. Let R = Q/(f1, . . . , fc) where (Q, m, k) is a regular local ring,
f1, . . . , fc is a regular sequence, and C, D ∈ Ktac(R). Then HomR(C, ΣiD) = 0 for
i ≫ 0 if and only if V (Q, f, C, D) = {0}
Proof. Consider the long exact sequence of Hom from the proof of theorem 4.4. If
HomR(C, ΣnD) vanishes for large n then HomQa (T C, ΣnT D) must also vanish for
large n. Thus for any ¯a ∈ kc such that ¯a 6= 0, ¯a /∈ V (Q, f, C, D).
Now conversely let V (Q, f, C, D) = {0} and let E = Li≥0
HomR(C, ΣiD) ⊗R k.
Then √Ann E = m and so mr ⊆ Ann E for some r > 0. Therefore mrE = 0 and so
for n ≫ 0 we get En ⊆ mrE≤n−r = 0. Hence for n ≫ 0, En = HomR(C, ΣnD) =
0.

(cid:3)

Theorem 6.2. Let R = Q/(f1, . . . , fc) where (Q, m, k) is a regular local ring,
f1, . . . , fc is a regular sequence, and C, D ∈ Ktac(R). Then the following hold.

(1) If D is a complete resolution of the residue ﬁeld k, then

V (Q, f, D, D) = kc.

(2) V (Q, f, C, D) = V (Q, f, C, C) ∩ V (Q, f, D, D)
(3) If D is a complete resolution of the ﬁeld k, then

V (Q, f, C, D) = V (Q, f, C, C).

(4) If C → C′ → Cone(α) → ΣC and D → D′ → Cone(β) → ΣD are exact

triangles in Ktac(R), then we have the following inclusions.

14

NATHAN T. STEELE

V (Q, f, C, D) ⊆ V (Q, f, C′, D) ∪ V (Q, f, Cone(α), D)
V (Q, f, C′, D) ⊆ V (Q, f, C, D) ∪ V (Q, f, Cone(α), D)

V (Q, f, Cone(α), D) ⊆ V (Q, f, C, D) ∪ V (Q, f, C′, D)

V (Q, f, C, D) ⊆ V (Q, f, C, D′) ∪ V (Q, f, C, Cone(β))
V (Q, f, C, D′) ⊆ V (Q, f, C, D) ∪ V (Q, f, C, Cone(β))

V (Q, f, C, Cone(β)) ⊆ V (Q, f, C, D) ∪ V (Q, f, C, D′)

Proof.

(1) By [10, 2], proj dimQa

k = ∞ thus HomQa (T C, ΣnT C) 6= 0 for inﬁnitely

(2) First let ¯a ∈ V (Q, f, C, C) ∩ V (Q, f, D, D) but ¯a /∈ V (Q, f, C, D). Then
HomQa (T C, ΣnT C) 6= 0 and HomQa (T D, ΣnT D) 6= 0 for inﬁnitely many
n but HomQa (T C, ΣnT D) = 0 for n ≫ 0. Then T C ≃ 0 ≃ T D but
HomQa (T C, ΣnT D) = 0 for n ≫ 0, a contradiction. Thus V (Q, f, C, C) ∩
V (Q, f, D, D) ⊆ V (Q, f, C, D).

HomR(C, ΣiC). Hence p(t) ∼ 0 and so p(HomR(t, D))(β) ∼ 0

Now let p(χ) ∈ AnnLi≥0

HomR(C, ΣiD)

HomR(C, ΣiD).

which implies that V (Q, f, C, D) ⊆ V (Q, f, C, C) ∩ V (Q, f, D, D).

(3)

V (Q, f, C, D) = V (Q, f, C, C) ∩ V (Q, f, D, D) =

V (Q, f, C, C) ∩ kc = V (Q, f, C, C)

, D) to the exact triangle

(4) Applying HomQa (

T C → T C′ → T Cone(α) → ΣT C

we get the long exact sequence

··· → HomQa (T Cone(α), T D) → HomQa (T C′, T D) → HomQa (T C, T D) → ··· .
If ¯a ∈ k is not in V (Q, f, C′, D) ∪ V (Q, f, Cone(α), D), then by the rank
variety deﬁnition HomQa (T C′, ΣnT D) = HomQa(T Cone(α), ΣnT D) = 0
for n ≫ 0. Thus by the long exact sequence, HomQa (T C, ΣnT D) = 0
for n ≫ 0 and so ¯a /∈ V (Q, f, C, D). Hence we have V (Q, f, C, D) ⊆
V (Q, f, C′, D) ∪ V (Q, f, Cone(α), D). The other inclusions can be proved
similarly.

7. Examples

We will now compute some simple examples of support varieties in Ktac(R). In
the ﬁrst example we let the ﬁeld be the complex numbers and choose a simple
periodic complex C. The resulting support variety V (Q, f, C, C) is a line in C2.

Then ed2 =(cid:18) x2 + 2y2

and so t1 =(cid:18) 1

Therefore

and so

V (Q, f, C, C) = Z(χ1 − 2χ2) = {(a, 2a)|a ∈ C}.

The next example illustrates property 2 from theorem 6.2, i.e. that V (Q, f, C, D) =

V (Q, f, C, C) ∩ V (Q, f, D, D).
Example 7.2. Let R = k[[x, y, z]]/(x2, y2, z2) and let C be the complex

where dC

and so

Therefore

HomR(C, ΣiC) ⊗R k) = (χ1χ2, χ3),

thus the support variety of C is

V (Q, f, C, C) = Z(χ1χ2, χ3)

i.e. the union of the x and y axes.

Now let D be the complex

dD

i−−−−→ R2

dD

i−1−−−−→ R2

dD

i−2−−−−→ ···

where dD

i =(cid:18) x 0

z (cid:19) for all i. Then

0 (cid:19) , and s3 =(cid:18) 0 0
0 1 (cid:19) .

Therefore the support variety of D is

i.e. the union of the x and z axes.

V (Q, f, D, D) = Z(χ1χ3, χ2)

When computing V (Q, f, C, C) we can use tk and HomR(tk, C) interchange-
ably. Similarly we can use sk and HomR(sk, D) interchangeably when comput-
ing V (Q, f, D, D). However, to compute V (Q, f, C, D) we need to ﬁnd either
HomR(tk, D) or HomR(C, sk) for all 1 ≤ k ≤ c. For any map h ∈ HomR(C, ΣiD),

h ◦(cid:18) x 0

y (cid:19) =(cid:18) x 0

0

0

we now have

This implies that h is of the form hn =(cid:18) an
HomR(t1, D) =(cid:18) 1

0

0

0

0 (cid:19) and HomR(t2, D) =(cid:18) 0 0
Ann(HomR(C, ΣiD) ⊗R k) = (χ2, χ3)

Therefore

so we get that

0

z (cid:19) ◦ h.
0 (cid:19). Since HomR(tk, C)(h) = h◦ tk
0 0 (cid:19) = HomR(t3, D).

V (Q, f, C, D) = Z(χ2, χ3) = V (Q, f, C, C) ∩ V (Q, f, D, D)

i.e. the support variety of C and D is the x axis.
