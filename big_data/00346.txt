Recently several anomalies in ﬂavor physics have been observed and it was noticed that lepto-
quarks might account for the deviations from the Standard Model. In this work, we examine the
eﬀects of new physics originated from a scalar leptoquark model on the kaon sector. The leptoquark
we consider is a TeV scale particle and within the reach of LHC. We use the existing experimental
data on the several kaon processes including K 0− ¯K 0 mixing, rare decays K + → π+ν ¯ν, KL → π0ν ¯ν,
short-distance part of KL → µ+µ− as well as lepton-ﬂavor-violating decay KL → µ±e∓ to obtain
useful constraints on the model.

INTRODUCTION

The discovery of the last missing piece, the Higgs
boson, in the ﬁrst run of Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
marks completion of the Standard Model (SM) [1, 2].
Though the SM has been exceptionally successful
in
explaining the experimental data collected so far, there
are many important questions which demand for the
physics beyond the SM [3]. Therefore it is natural
to consider the SM as the low-energy limit of a more
general theory above electroweak scale. The direct
collider searches at the high-energy frontier ( TeV-scale)
have not found any new particle but,
interestingly,
there are some tantalizing hints towards NP from
high-precision low-energy experiments
in the ﬂavor
sector. To be speciﬁc, recently the LHCb collabo-
ration has reported the ratio of branching fractions

for the semitauonic decay of B meson, ¯B → D∗τ ¯ν,
to be R(D∗) = 0.336 ± 0.027(stat.) ± 0.030(syst.)
with the SM expectation 0.252 ± 0.005, amounting
to a 2.1σ excess [4]. To reduce theoretical uncer-
tainties,
ratios

the observables are introduced as

=

(cid:96) = e, µ. This measurement is in agreement with

R(X) = BR( ¯B → Xτ ¯ν)/BR( ¯B → X(cid:96)¯ν), where
the measurements of ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν reported by the
BaBar [5, 6] and Belle [7] collaborations. The results
reported by BaBar and Belle are given by R(D)BaBar =
0.440 ± 0.058 ± 0.042, R(D)Belle = 0.375 ± 0.064 ± 0.026
and R(D∗)BaBar
0.332 ± 0.024 ± 0.018,
R(D∗)Belle = 0.293 ± 0.038 ± 0.015, with the SM
expectations given by R(D)SM = 0.300 ± 0.010 and
R(D∗)SM = 0.252 ± 0.005. These results are consistent
with earlier measurements [8, 9] and when combined
together show a signiﬁcant deviation from the SM.
Another interesting indirect hint of NP comes from the

[10]. Though the individual branching fractions for

¯B → ¯Kµ+µ− and ¯B → ¯Ke+e− are marred with

large hadronic uncertainties in the SM [11],
their
ratio is a very clean observable and predicted to be
RK = 1.0003 ± 0.0001 [11, 12]. Also, the recent data on
angular observables of 4-body distribution in the process
(B → K∗(→ K →)(cid:96)+(cid:96)− indicate some tension with the
SM [13, 14], particularly the deviation of ∼ 3σ in two

respect to the SM prediction has also been reported by
LHCb [16]. The model-independent global ﬁts to the

Several new physics (NP) scenarios have been pro-
posed to explain these discrepancies. The excesses in
RD(∗) have been explained in a generalized framework
of 2HDM in Refs. [22–24], in the framework of R-parity
violating (RPV) Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM) in Ref.
[25] and E6 motivated Alterna-
tive Left-Right Symmetric Model (ALRSM) in Ref. [29].
While in Refs.
[17, 19, 20, 26–28] the excesses have
been addressed in the context of leptoquark models.
The possible explanation for observed anomalies in

b → sµ+µ− processes preferably demands a negative
contribution to Wilson coeﬃcient of semileptonic op-
erator (¯sb)V−A(¯µγαµ) [15, 30].
Several NP models,
generally involving Z
vector bosons [31–37] or lepto-
quarks [38–43, 45], are able to produce such operators
with required eﬀects
to explain the present data.
Among many NP scenarios it was noted that anoma-
lies in RK and RD∗ can be simultaneously explained
quite well in the framework of leptoquark models [40–44].

(cid:48)

In view of this, we are motivated to study a TeV-
scale leptoquark model and analyze NP eﬀects on the
kaon sector. It is known that the studies of kaon decays
have played a vital role in retrieving information on ﬂavor
structure of the SM. In particular, neutral kaon mixing
and rare decays of kaon have been analyzed in various
extensions of the SM and are known to provide some of
the most stringent constraints on NP [46–57]. The NP

model we consider in this paper is a simple extension of
the SM by a single scalar leptoquark. The leptoquark φ
with mass Mφ has (SU (3), SU (2))U (1) quantum numbers
(3, 1)−1/3. This model is interesting considering that it
has all the necessary ingredients accommodating semilep-
tonic b → c and b → s decays to explain the anomalies
in the LFU ratios discussed above [42, 58]. Following
the conventions of Ref.[42], the Lagrangian governing the
leptoquark interaction with ﬁrst family fermions is given
by

ceeds at tree-level through the exchange of leptoquark
(φ).
Integrating out the heavy particles gives rise to
low-energy 6-dimension eﬀective operators which can
produce required eﬀects to satisfy experimental data.
In Ref. [42] it was shown that with O(1) left-handed
and relatively
suppressed right-handed couplings,
one can explain the observed excesses in the rate of

B → D(∗)τ ¯ν decays. The authors of Ref. [42] were also
able to simultaneously explain the observed anomalies
in RK with large (∼ O(1)) left-handed couplings for
a TeV scale leptoquark.
In this model such large
couplings are possible because the leading contribution
to ¯B → ¯Kµ+µ− comes from one-loop diagrams and

therefore additional GIM and CKM suppression com-
pensate for the ‘largeness’ of the couplings. This is in
contrast to NP models [39, 58, 59] where RK arises at
tree-level, which renders the couplings very small
in
order to have leptoquarks within reach of LHC. Apart
from B-system, this model has also been explored in the
context of FCNC decays of D-meson.
In Refs. [60–62]
impact of scalar (as well as vector) leptoquarks on

FCNC processes D0 → µ+µ− and D+ → π+µ+µ− have

been studied, and using the existing experimental results
strong bounds on the leptoquark coupling have been
derived. However, to the best of our knowledge, the
eﬀects of new physics on the kaon sector have not been
investigated before in scalar leptoquark (3, 1)−1/3 model.
We start by writing the eﬀective Hamiltonian relevant
for each case and discuss the eﬀective operators and
corresponding coupling strengths (Wilson coeﬃcients)
generated in the model. The explicit expressions of
new contributions in terms of parameters of the model
are derived. We then discuss NP aﬀecting the various
kaon processes such as K + → π+ν ¯ν, KL → π0ν ¯ν,
KL → µ+µ− as well as LFV decay KL → µ±e∓. Using
the existing experimental information on these processes,
the constraints on the leptoquark couplings are obtained.

model and obtain constraints on the couplings. In sec-
tion III and IV we constrain the parameter space us-
ing information on BR(K + → π+ν ¯ν) and CP violating
BR(KL → π0ν ¯ν) respectively. In section V we discuss
the new contribution to short-distance part of rare de-
cay KL → µ+µ− in this model and obtain constraints on
bounds on BR(KL → µ+µ−)SD. In section VI, we discuss
LFV process KL → µ∓e± and constrain the oﬀ-diagonal

the generation-diagonal leptoquark couplings using the

couplings of leptoquark contributing to NP Wilson co-
eﬃcients. Finally We summarize our results in the last
section.

II. CONSTRAINTS FROM K 0 − ¯K 0 MIXING

The phenomenon of meson-antimeson oscillation, be-
ing a ﬂavor changing neutral current (FCNC) process, is
very sensitive to heavy particles propagating in the mix-
ing amplitude, and therefore, it provides a powerful tool
to test the SM and a window to observe NP. In this sec-
tion we focus on the mixing of neutral kaon meson. The

experimental measurement of K 0 − ¯K 0 mass diﬀerence
∆mK and of CP violating parameter K has been instru-
mental in constraining not only the parameters of Unitar-
ity Triangle (UT) but also providing stringent constraints

on NP. Theoretical calculations for K 0 − ¯K 0 mixing are

done in the framework of eﬀective ﬁeld theories (EFT),
which allow to separate long- and short-distance contri-

butions. The leading contribution to K 0− ¯K 0 oscillations

in the SM comes from so-called box diagrams generated
through internal line exchange of W-boson and up type
quark pair. The eﬀective SM Hamiltonian for |∆S| = 2
resulting from the evaluation of box diagrams is written
as [63, 64]

However, these bounds are subject to signiﬁcant un-
certainties from poorly known long distance eﬀect in

K 0 − ¯K 0 systems [74]. As discussed in the next section,
we ﬁnd that a more constraining bound on the product of
the couplings Re(ξds) and Im(ξds) can be obtained from
theoretically rather clean rare processes K + → π+ν ¯ν and
KL → π0ν ¯ν.

In the (3, 1)−1/3 leptoquark model, the internal line ex-
change of neutrino-leptoquark pair induces new Feynman
diagrams which contributes to K 0 − ¯K 0 mixing. The di-

agrams are shown in Fig(1). The new eﬀects modify the

computed with exceptionally high level of precision (For
a review see [75]). In the SM these decays are dominated
by Z-penguin and box diagrams which exhibit hard,
power-like GIM suppression as compared to logarithmic
GIM suppression generally seen in other loop-induced
meson decays. At the leading order, Both modes
are induced by a single dimension-six local operator
(¯sd)V−A(¯νν)V−A. The hadronic matrix element of this
operator can be measured precisely in K + → π0e+ν
decays, including isospin breaking corrections [76, 77].
The principal contributions to the error in theoretical
predictions originates from the uncertainties on the
current values of λt and mc. The long-distance eﬀects
are rather suppressed and have been found out to be
small [78–80].

In the SM the eﬀective Hamiltonian for K → πν ¯ν de-

where α(MZ) = 1/127.9 is the electromagnetic cou-

from Particle Data Group (PDG), BR(K + → π+ν ¯ν) =
(1.7±1.1)×10−10 [90], we obtain constraint on Re ξds and
Im ξds, shown in Fig 3. A most conservative bound on
individual couplings Re ξds and Im ξds can be obtained
by taking only one set to be non-zero at a time. We
ﬁnd that for a leptoquark of 1 TeV mass, the constraints

before, these bounds rules out a large parameter space

are given by −7.2 × 10−4 < Re ξds < 2.2 × 10−4 and
−3.3 × 10−4 < Im ξds < 4.9 × 10−4. As pointed out
allowed from K 0 − ¯K 0 mixing. The coupling Im ξds can
also be probed independently through decay KL → π0ν ¯ν,
which is the subject of our next section.

FIG. 4: The dependence of BR(KL → π0ν ¯ν) on Im ξds. The
red shaded region is currently disfavored by experimental data
at 90% C.L.

Since the decay has not been observed so far and the
present experimental limits are 3 order of magnitude
above the SM predictions [89], we ﬁnd that constraints
from KL → π0ν ¯ν are weaker compared to those obtained
in the case of K + → π+ν ¯ν.

IV. CONSTRAINTS FROM KL → π0ν ¯ν

V. CONSTRAINTS FROM KL → µ+µ−

The neutral decay mode KL → π0ν ¯ν is CP violat-
ing. In contrast to the decay rate of K + → π+ν ¯ν which
depends on the real and imaginary parts of λt, with a
small contribution from the real part of λc, the rate of
KL → π0ν ¯ν depends only on Imλt. Due to absence of
charm contribution, the prediction for BR(KL → π0ν ¯ν)
are theoretically cleaner. The principal sources of error
are the uncertainties on Imλt and mt. In the SM, the
branching ratio is given by [75]

The exchange of leptoquark φ induces new contribu-
tion to the rate which can be accommodated in the ex-
pression of branching ratio by replacing X(xt) with Xnew
given in Eq. (21). Experimentally, only a upper bound
on the branching ratio is available: BR(KL → π0ν ¯ν) <
2.8 × 10−8 at 90% C.L. [90]. In Fig 4, we plot the de-
pendence of KL → πν ¯ν branching ratio on the imag-
inary part of eﬀective couplings ξds. Numerically the
constraints are given by

The decay KL → µ+µ− is sensitive to much of the
same short-distance physics (i.e., λt and mt) as K → πν ¯ν
and therefore provide complementary information on the
structure of FCNC |∆S| = 1 transitions. This is impor-
tant because experimentally a much precise measurement
compared to K → πν ¯ν is available: BR(KL → µµ) =
(6.84 ± 0.11) × 10−9 [90]. However, theoretical situation
is far more complex (for a review see [91, 92]). The am-
plitude for the KL → µ+µ− can be decomposed into a
to total decay rate (KL → µ+µ−)) comes from the real

dispersive (real) and an absorptive (imaginary) part. The
dominant contribution to the absorptive part (as well as

those calculated in the case of b → sµµ in Ref.[42]. Cor-

To simplify further analysis, we invoke the assumption
that except the SM contribution only one of the NP op-
erators contributes dominantly. This assumption helps
us in determining the limits on the dominant Wilson

coeﬃcient from BR (KL → µ+µ−)SD and the general-

ization of this situation to incorporate more than one
NP operator contribution is straight forward. There-
fore, in what follows, we will ignore the contribution of
right-handed operator in further analysis. In Fig(6), we

In deriving the above condition we have employed the
conservative upper bound on Re ξds/M 2
φ obtained from
K + → π+ν ¯ν in section III. We ﬁnd that constraints from
SD branching ratio of KL → µ+µ− are not severe and
large (∼ O(1)) generation-diagonal leptoquark couplings
are allowed. This is in agreement with the analysis done
in Ref. [42] for explaining anomalies in RK. We also note
from Eq. (37) that the top contribution to ¯s → ¯dµ+µ−
for the considered masses of the leptoquark (∼ 1 TeV) is
largely enhanced in contrast to the eﬀects found in case of
b → sµ+µ− processes [42] where the top contribution is

suppressed for the same choice of the leptoquark masses.

in the SM they are forbidden. Therefore any observa-
tion of such process immediately indicates towards the
presence of NP. The leptoquark φ can mediate KL → µe
decay through similar diagrams shown in Fig 5 with one
of the µ line being replaced with e. After integrating
out heavy particles, new eﬀective operators relevant for
KL → µe are generated. The operators are similar to
those in Eq. (31) but with one of the µ changed to e.

to mention that the same Wilson coeﬃcients also con-

ever, as pointed out in Ref.[94], the constraints on Wilson

VI. CONSTRAINTS FROM LFV DECAY

KL → µ∓e±

VII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section we discuss the eﬀects of the leptoquark

φ on LFV process K → µ∓e±. Experimentally there is
only upper bound on this process: BR(KL → µ∓e±) <

In light of several anomalies observed in semileptonic
B-decays, often explained by invoking leptoquark NP
models, we have studied a scalar leptoquark model
in the context of rare decays of kaons and neutral

kaon mixing. The model is interesting because it can
provide one of the possible explanations for the observed
discrepancies in semileptonic B-decays. We examined
leptoquark contribution to the several
the eﬀects of

kaon processes involving K 0 − ¯K 0 mixing, K + → π+ν ¯ν,
KL → π0ν ¯ν, KL → µ+µ− and LFV decay KL → µ∓e±.

Working in the framework of EFT, we have discussed
the eﬀective operators generated after integrating out
heavy particles and written down the explicit expres-
sions of corresponding Wilson coeﬃcient in terms of
leptoquark couplings. Using the present experimental
information on these decays, we have derived bounds
on the couplings relevant for kaon processes. We

found that the constraints from K 0 − ¯K 0 on the real
left-handed coupling ξds are
∼ O(10−2). However, the same set of couplings can also
be constrained from BR(K + → π+ν ¯ν), BR(KL → π0ν ¯ν)
and it was found that constraints from rare process
BR(K + → π+ν ¯ν) are about 2 order of magnitude more
severe than those obtained from the mixing of neutral
kaons. Assuming one-operator dominance scenario, we
have constrained the NP Wilson coeﬃcient contributing

on NP Wilson coeﬃcient to obtain the constraints on
generation diagonal
leptoquark couplings. We found

the top contribution is enhanced for the considered
range of
leptoquark masses. We have also done a

to rate of KL → µ+µ−. We have further used the bounds
that present measured value of BR(KL → µ+µ−) allows
generation-diagonal coupling of leptoquark to be ∼ O(1).
This result is in agreement with the one obtained in
Ref.
for explaining experimental data on RK.
However, whereas the top contribution to b → sµ+µ−
is suppressed, we found that in case of the ¯s → ¯dµ+µ−,
similar analysis for the case of LFV decay KL → µ∓e±
on BR (KL → µ∓e±) does not provide very strong con-
straints and involved couplings can be as large as ∼ O(1).
