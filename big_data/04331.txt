Motivated by recent experimental observation of magnon Hall eﬀect on the pyrochlore and the
kagome lattices, we theoretically propose a simple realization of magnon Hall eﬀect in a two-band
model on the honeycomb lattice. The magnon Hall eﬀect of spin excitations arises in the usual
way via the breaking of inversion symmetry of the lattice, however, by a next-nearest-neighbour
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction. We ﬁnd that the thermal Hall conductivity, κxy, has
a ﬁxed sign for all parameter regimes considered. We argue that the ﬁxed sign of κxy on the
honeycomb lattice is a consequence of the magnon bulk bands and the small gap generated by the
DM interaction. These results are in contrast to the kagome and pyrochlore lattices where a sign
change has been reported. We further show that the low-temperature dependence on the magnon
Hall conductivity follows a T 2 law, as opposed to the kagome and pyrochlore lattices.

Introduction.– In recent years, the understanding of
the topological nature of phonons and magnons in quan-
tum materials has been at the pinnacle of intense inves-
tigation. These materials are believed to be applicable
to many technological systems such as thermal devices
and spintronics. The most fascinating property of these
materials is the observation of thermal Hall eﬀect, which
occurs at ﬁnite temperature. Phonon Hall eﬀect has been
observed experimentally in Tb3Ga5O12,1 and the topo-
logical properties have been studied in terms of the Berry
curvature of the system in diﬀerent lattice geometries.2,3
Recently, the topological properties of magnons in quan-
tum magnets have become a subject of interest because
of the possibility of thermal Hall eﬀect characterized
by a nonzero thermal Hall conductivity κxy, at ﬁnite
temperature. Thermal Hall eﬀect in quantum magnets
was ﬁrst predicted theoretically by Katsura-Nagaosa-
Lee4 on the kagome and pyrochlore ferromagnets with
a nearest-neighbour (NN) Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM)
interaction.5 It was later discovered experimentally by
Onose et al.,6 in the ferromagnetic insulator Lu2V2O7 on
three-dimensional (3D) pyrochlore lattice. Subsequently,
Matsumoto and Murakami7 relates κxy directly to the
Berry curvature of the magnon bulk bands reminiscent
of Hall conductivity in electronic systems.8 This result
shows that at nonzero temperature, κxy (cid:54)= 0 provided
that the magnon bulk bands have a nontrivial gap at the
Dirac points, i.e., the points where two bands touch in
the Brillouin zone.

It has also been shown that κxy changes sign as a func-
tion of temperature and magnetic ﬁeld.9 Also recently,
thermal Hall eﬀect has been observed experimentally on
the 2D kagome magnet Cu(1-3, bdc).10 Thus, opening
a wide spectrum of research to search for topological
magnon insulators in 2D quantum magnets. In both 2D
kagome magnet and 3D pyrochlore magnet, the breaking
of inversion symmetry by a NN DM interaction plays a
crucial role. The DM interaction introduces a spin-orbit
coupling, as a result the bosons accumulate a phase as
they hop through the lattice sites, reminiscent of Hal-
dane model in electronic systems.11 Thus far, thermal
Hall eﬀect in quantum magnets has been studied only in

two lattice geometries — the three magnon bulk bands of
the kagome lattice4,9,10 and the four magnon bulk bands
of the pyrochlore lattice.6,7 However, topological magnon
insulator is also realizable in a two-band model, which is
the least possible number of bands with nontrivial band
topology.

In this regard, the author has previously proposed a
two-band model on the honeycomb lattice with nontriv-
ial magnon bands topology.12 The purpose of this paper
is to provide a simple theoretical realization of magnon
Hall eﬀect in this two-band model on the honeycomb lat-
tice. In this system, a nontrivial magnon bulk gap arises
in the presence of a next-nearest-neighbour (NNN) DM
interaction as opposed to the kagome and the pyrochlore
lattices.4,6,7,9,10 We explicitly demonstrate the theory of
thermal Hall eﬀect in this system. We ﬁnd that the ther-
mal Hall conductivity in this system has a ﬁxed sign for
all values of the parameters considered at ﬁnite temper-
atures. We argue that the absence of a sign change in
κxy is a consequence of the structure of the magnon bulk
bands and can be regarded as an artifact of two-band
models. In contrast to 2D kagome and 3D pyrochlore lat-
tices, we also ﬁnd that the low-temperature dependence
on the magnon Hall conductivity is ∝ T 2. As we have
recently shown,13 this system can be mapped to hardcore
bosons on the honeycomb lattice with Haldane-like NNN
hopping. In fact, a recent study has reported an experi-
mental realization of the Haldane model using ultracold
fermionic atoms in a periodically modulated optical hon-
eycomb lattice.14 Thus, the results obtained in this paper
suggest an experimental procedure to search for two-band
topological magnon insulators within a class of 2D quan-
tum magnets and ultracold atoms trapped in honeycomb
optical lattice.

Two-band model.– A two-band model is the least pos-
sible number of bands that exhibit a nontrivial gap in the
spin excitation spectra. Such model can be constructed
from a honeycomb lattice as previously shown by the
author.12 The two-band model we study is governed by
the Hamiltonian12

The ﬁrst two terms are ferromagnetic Heisenberg ex-
change couplings on the NN sites and NNN sites respec-
tively. The third term is a NNN DM interaction between
sites i and j. Figure (1) shows the sign of the DM interac-
tion on the unit cells with Dij = D for i → j (plus cyclic
permutaions) on sublattice A, and Dij = −D for i → j
on sublattice B. The NNN DM interaction plays the role
of spin-orbit coupling and breaks the inversion symmetry
of the lattice. It generates equal and opposite chirality
in each triangular plaquette of the unit cell as shown in
Fig. (1). It is noted that the system is unfrustrated since
the DM interaction introduces canted ferromagnet on the
NNN sites. The last term is the Zeeman magnetic ﬁeld
with h = gµBB being the magnetic ﬁeld strength, g is
the spin g-factor and µB is the Bohr magneton.

It is well-known that the physics of thermal Hall
eﬀect can be understood entirely by semiclassical
methods.4,6,7,9 Recent experimental
results on the
kagome ferromagnet10 suggest that the Holstein Pri-
makoﬀ transformation is a better predictor than the
Schwinger boson representation.

It is noted that for vD = 0, the system is gapless at two
inequivalent Dirac points12,15 K± = ± 4π

ˆx shown in

Fig. (1). The NNN interaction J(cid:48) and the magnetic ﬁeld
h only shift the energy of the Dirac points but do not
open a gap. The gapless Dirac points are also robust
against higher order magnon-magnon interactions.15 As
shown in Fig. (2), a gap only opens when vD (cid:54)= 0.

Berry curvature and Chern number.– In fermionic sys-
tems, nontrivial band topology arises from the structure
of the energy bands. This is characterized by a nonzero
Berry curvature deﬁned via the eigenstates of the sys-
tem, which gives rise to a quantized integer (when the
Fermi energy lies between the energy gap) called the
Chern number. In bosonic systems, the idea is essentially
the same. A nontrivial band topology arises only when
the system exhibits a nontrivial gap in the spin wave ex-
citation spectra. In 2D lattices, the Berry curvature is
generally given by

Ωλ(k) = −2Im[(cid:104)∂kxψλ(k)|∂ky ψλ(k)(cid:105)].

The Berry curvature has two important properties.
Firstly, it is controlled by the mass gap at the Dirac
points and the Chern number

d2k Ωλ(k),

(13)

of a gapless system vD = 0 vanishes. Secondly, for a
gapped system vD (cid:54)= 0, the maximum contribution to
the Chern number comes from the states near K±, i.e.
when ∆ = |m(k)| → 0, also the total Chern number
vanishes. Therefore, no magnon edge state exists above
the upper band as previously shown.12

Magnon Hall eﬀect.– Magnon Hall eﬀect arises from
the topology of the magnon bulk bands. As shown in
the preceding section, the topological properties of Dirac

magnons on the honeycomb lattice is induced by a NNN
DM interaction, which introduces a phase in the magnon
propagation, thus opens a gap at the Dirac points.
In
the following, we demonstrate how the topological na-
ture of this system is manifested by computing impor-
tant experimental observables. The important quantity
characterizing the magnon Hall eﬀect is the thermal Hall
conductivity. Similar to Hall conductivity in electronic
systems, thermal Hall conductivity is related to the Berry
curvature of the eigenstates. There are two contributions
to the thermal conductivity given by7

It is evident that the thermal Hall conductivity is the
Berry curvature weighed by the c2(nλ) function. It de-
pends on the existence of a nontrivial gap in the magnon
bulk bands at T (cid:54)= 0, which requires a minimum of
two bands. The largest contribution to κxy comes from
the states near K± due to the Berry curvature as men-
tioned above.
In what follows, we apply Eq. (16) to

Figure (3) shows the plot of κxy(T ) vs. T and the µBB
vs. T plane of κxy. We observe no sign change in κxy(T )
for all parameter regimes considered. This can be under-
stood directly from Eq. (16). Since the Berry curvatures
are equal and opposite Ω+ = −Ω−, Eq. (16) involves
the diﬀerence between the c2[n(λ, T )] functions. At low
temperatures, the lower band dominates, but due to the
fact that c2[n(−, T )] > 0 and Ω− > 0 for all param-
eter regimes, the thermal Hall conductivity is negative,
κxy(T ) < 0, in the low-T limit and decreases exponen-
tially as shown in Fig. (3). At high temperatures, the
T → ∞ limit of κxy(T ) is given by9

In Fig. (4) we show the integrand in Eq. (17) describing
the high-temperature limit of the thermal Hall conductiv-

ity. As mentioned above, it is obvious that the dominant
contribution comes from the Dirac points K±. Because
of the fact that + > −, the integrand is dominated by
the upper band, but since Ω+ = −Ω− < 0 the integrand
is negative. Again κxy∞ < 0 as shown in Fig. (3). There-
fore, the high and low temperature limits of κxy(T ) have
the same sign.

The sign of κxy is inherited from the the topology of
the magnon bulk bands. It can be understood as follows.
In the case of kagome ferromagnet,4 the DM interaction
appears as a NN coupling and enters into the magnon
bulk bands through a phase factor φ = arctan(D/J).
We see that the DM interaction can take inﬁnite values
in the range D ∈ [0,∞] with φ ∈ [0, π/2]. For moderate
value of D, the three energy bands are separated from
each other. For large value of D, the middle band ﬂat-
tens whereas the bottom and the top bands separate by
a very large gap. As a result of this large separation,
the bottom band is populated at low temperatures with
a positive Berry curvature and the top band is popu-
lated at high temperatures with a negative Berry curva-
ture, whereas the Berry curvature vanishes for the mid-
dle band. This results in the sign change in the ther-
mal Hall conductivity as the system transits from low
to high temperatures.7,9,10 The large band separation is
also responsible for a large κxy recently observed.10 In
the present model, however, a large DM interaction de-
stroys the topology of the magnon bulk bands, thereby
restricting the DM interaction to a very small regime.
Thus, the gap generated by the DM interaction at K± is
very small. Therefore, the two bands are not widely sep-
arated. As a result, the high and low temperature limits
of κxy yield the same sign although the Chern numbers
have opposite signs.

Next, we calculate the explicit form of the low-
temperature dependence of Eq. (14). As mentioned
above, the lower band dominates at low temperature.

k = 0, we must expand it to quadratic order. The de-
nominator is ﬁnite at k = 0, so we expand the numerator

Figure (5) shows the plot of Cλ() and κxy() as a func-
tion of . As mentioned above the main contributions to
these functions stem from the states near K±. The plot
of κxy() vs.  shows a change sign. This is not a con-
tradiction to the ﬁxed sign in κxy(T ) vs. T curve. The
reason is because for each value of  there is only one
value of κxy() for all T and µBB. In other words, the
trends of κxy(T ) and κxy() remain intact for all T and
µBB with other parameters ﬁxed.

Conclusion.– In summary, we have shown that magnon
Hall eﬀect is realizable in a two-band model on the hon-
eycomb lattice. We showed two striking features of this
model. Firstly, we showed that on the honeycomb lat-
tice, thermal Hall conductivity does not change sign
as the temperature and the magnetic ﬁeld vary, with
other parameters ﬁxed. This is interpreted as a re-
sult of small gap generated by a next-nearest-neighbour
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction at the Dirac points.
Secondly, we showed that the low-temperature depen-
dence on the thermal Hall conductivity is also diﬀer-
ent from the kagome and pyrochlore lattices and follows
E ∝ T 2. As previously mentioned, the
the relation: κxy
model studied here can be mapped directly to hard-core
bosons,13 hence the most feasible way to realize magnon
Hall eﬀect experimentally on a two-band honeycomb lat-
tice is by using ultracold atoms trapped in honeycomb
optical lattice. This might also be applicable to the ﬁeld
of spintronics.
