In this paper we study in detail the eﬀect of the rotational alignment between a hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) slab and the graphene layers in the vertical current of a a graphene-hBN-graphene
device. We show how for small rotational angles, the transference of momentum by the hBN crystal
lattice leads to multiple peaks in the I-V curve of the device, giving origin to multiple regions
displaying negative diﬀerential conductance. We also study the eﬀect of scattering by phonons in
the vertical current an see how the opening up of inelastic tunneling events allowed by spontaneous
emission of optical phonons leads to sharp peaks in the second derivative of the current.

Being able to tailor the properties of materials at will,
aiming at unveiling new physics and achieving never
though before properties, is the main goal of condensed
matter physics and materials science. However, the de-
gree of manipulation we can undertake using conven-
tional materials is somewhat limited.
In the last ten
years, the advent of two-dimensional materials1,2 opened
new avenues waiting for being explored. One of the less
explored avenue is the one opened by van der Waals
(vdW) hybrid structures3, new systems formed by stack-
ing layers of two-dimensional crystals on top of each
other, have emerged as a new approach for manipulat-
ing and tailoring material properties at will4,5. Among
the various possible combinations of two dimensional
crystals, graphene - semiconductor/insulator - graphene
vdW structures, with semiconducting transition metal
dichalcogenide (STMDC) or hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN) as the semiconductor/insulator, have emerged as
some of the most promising from the point of view of
applications. The possibility of controlling electrostat-
ically the eﬀective barrier height presented by the in-
sulator/semiconductor to the vertical ﬂow of electrons
between the two graphene layers with a gate voltage
has enabled the operation these devices as transistors6–8,
with ON/OFF ratios as high as 106 being possible in
graphene-WS2-graphene devices8. It was also shown that
graphene-STMDC-graphene devices can operate as pho-
todectectors with high quantum eﬃciencies and fast re-
sponse times9–11. Due to the extreme high quality and
atomically sharp interfaces12 between diﬀerent layers in
vdW structures ,
lattice mismatch and relative align-
ment between consecutive layers play a fundamental role
in determining the electronic coupling between diﬀerent
layers of the vdW structure, ultimately determining its
electronic and optical properties. Lattice misalignment
between diﬀerent layers has been known to lead to the
formation of Moir patterns in rotated graphite layers13.
The eﬀect of lattice misalignment and mismatch has been
extensively studied in the context of twisted graphene
bilayers and graphene-on-hBN structures. It was shown
theoretically and experimentally, that misalignment in a

2

equilibrium Green’s function framework and using a
tight-binding based continuous Hamiltonian. We show
that the present theory reduces to the ones used in
Refs. 23 and 24. By taking into account processes in-
volving transference of momentum by the hBN crystal
lattice to the tunneling electrons, we ﬁnd that the verti-
cal current depends sensitively on the relative alignment
between the graphene layers and the hBN slab and that
by carefully controlling this alignment, it is possible to
obtain several peaks in the I-V curve of the device, fol-
lowed by regions of NDC, a possibility that has not been
considered previously. We also ﬁnd out that the struc-
ture of graphene wavefunctions manifests itself in the
vertical current, suppressing some of the current peaks
that would be expected with considerations based only
on electronic dispersion relations. We study the eﬀect of
resonant disorder in the graphene layers in the vertical
current, treated within the self-consistent Born approx-
imation (SCBA) which correctly describes the propor-
tionality of the transport lifetime with the energy32. We
ﬁnally study how phonons and disorder give origin to
non-coherent current between the two graphene layers,
deriving an expression for it.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. II we de-
scribe the theoretical framework we employed in this
work:
in subsection II A, we present the Hamiltonian
used to model the graphene-hBN-graphene device and
in subsection II B we present the fundamental equa-
tions used to treat transport within the non-equilibrium
Green’s functions formalism. In Sec. III we discuss the
coherent tunneling ﬂowing through a pristine device tak-
ing into account the lattice mismatch and misalignment
between graphene layers and the hBN slab. The con-
sequences of treating graphene as part of the device or
as external contacts are discussed and the role of the
momentum transferred to the tunneling electrons by the
hBN lattice is analyzed in detail. The eﬀect of an in-
plane magnetic ﬁeld in the current is also discussed. In
Sec. IV, the eﬀects of disorder and phonon scattering
into the vertical current are studied and a expression for
the phonon/disorder assisted current to lowest order in
perturbation theory is derived. Finally, in Sec. V we
conclude. Technical details and longer derivations are
include as Appendices.

II. FORMALISM

We want to study the vertical current ﬂowing through
a device formed by two graphene layers (bottom, bg, and
top, tg) separated by a few layers, N , of hBN. The dis-
tance between the two graphene layers is given by d. We
assume that the top graphene layer and the hBN slab
are rotated with respect to the bottom graphene layer by
an angle of θtg and θhBN, respectively. We assume that
layers forming the hBN slab are perfectly aligned with
an AA(cid:48) stacking33,34 (consecutive honeycomb lattices are
perfectly aligned, with each boron/nitrogen atom of one

graphene bilayer leads to a renormalization of graphene’s
Fermi velocity14,15. It was also found out that mismatch
and misalignment controls the formation of mini Dirac
cones in the band structure of graphene - hBN structures
systems16–21.. The dependence of the vertical current in
vdW structures on the rotation between diﬀerent layers
was ﬁrst studied in Ref. 22 in the context of twisted bi-
layer graphene, where it was found that the current is
extremely sensitive to the twist angle. Although this de-
pendence was not at ﬁrst completely appreciated, it was
soon understood and veriﬁed23,24 that the misalignment
between the graphene layers in graphene-hBN-graphene
structures can lead to the occurrence of negative diﬀeren-
tial conductance (NDC) regions, with the I-V curve dis-
playing peaks whose dependence on the bias voltage de-
pends on the rotation angle between the graphene layers.
More recently, the eﬀect of misalignment on the vertical
current in devices formed by two graphene bilayers25–27
and by one graphene monolayer and a graphene bilayer
separated by hBN has also been studied.28 Scattering by
phonons can lead to incoherent phonon assisted tunnel-
ing between the graphene layers. This eﬀect has been
ﬁrst theoretically studied for vdW structures for twisted
graphene bilayers29. More recently, eﬀects of phonon
assisted scattering on vertical transport have been ex-
perimentally detected in graphene-hBN-graphite30 and
graphene-hBN-graphene structures31 and have been pro-
posed as a possible way to probe the phonon spectrum
of vdW structures.

In this paper we describe the vertical current in
graphene-hBN-graphene devices with misaligned layers,
and for small twist angles, properly taking into ac-
count momentum conservation rules, within the non-

(a)(b)(c)VbiasVgatelayer directly on top of the nitrogen/atom of the next
layer). A bias voltage, Vbias, can be applied between the
top and bottom graphene layers, which will induce a cur-
rent between the two. The doping of the graphene lay-
ers can be controlled by application of a gate voltage to
the bottom graphene. A schematic of the typical device
structure is shown in Fig. 1.

A. Model Hamiltonian

We model the graphene - hBN - graphene system with

the following Hamiltonian

H =Hbg + Htg + HhBN+

+ (ThBN,bg + ThBN,tg + h.c.) ,

(1)

where Hbg/tg is the Hamiltonian describing the isolated
†
bottom/top graphene layer and ThBN,bg/tg = T
bg/tg,hBN
describes the hopping of electrons from the bottom/top
graphene layer to the hBN slab. The current between
the two graphene layers will be dominated by low en-
ergy states. Focusing on the states close to the Kbg and
bg = −Kbg points of the bottom graphene layer, we
K(cid:48)
write the Hamiltonian of the bottom graphene layer in
sublattice basis and in term of Bloch states as the mass-
less Dirac Hamiltonian

the angle formed between k and Kbg. We choose the
zero of energy to lie at the Fermi level of the bottom
graphene layer, in which case we have Vbg = −F,bg,
where F,bg is the Fermi energy of the bottom graphene
layer measured from its Dirac point. The Hamiltonian
in Eq. (2) is diagonalized by the eigenstates |k, τ, λ(cid:105)bg =

tion k,λ = λvF |k|, with λ = ±1 for electrons in the
conduction/valence band. Since we will be interested
in studying the vertical current to lowest order in the
graphene-hBN coupling, we neglect the eﬀect of the pe-
riodic potential generated by the hBN slab in dispersion
relation of graphene electronic states16–20,35,36. Using the
same reference frame in momentum space as in Eq. (2),

(R(θ) a rotation matrix), ∆Kb,t = Kbg − Ktg is the
displacement between the Dirac points of the two rotated
graphene layers and k is measured with respect to the
τ Kbg Dirac point of the bottom graphene graphene layer.
θk(cid:48),tg is the angle between k(cid:48) and Ktg and Vtg is an on-

level of the top graphene layer measured from its Dirac
point and e > 0 the fundamental electronic charge. The
remaining symbols in Eq. (3) are similarly deﬁned to the
ones in Eq. (2). Due to the large band gap of boron

oﬀset between graphene and hBN sites, the charge accu-
mulated in the hBN layers will be negligible. In this case
a simple electrostatic calculation (see Appendix A) gives
us V(cid:96) = −F,bg − (F,tg + eVbias) (cid:96)/ (N + 1). For two ro-
tated crystal layers, Bloch states from diﬀerent layers can
only be coupled provided momentum is conserved mod-
ulo any combination of reciprocal lattice vectors of both
layers22,37, in a so called generalized Umklapp process.
Focusing on low energy states and considering only the
three most relevant processes, the coupling between the

where bi,X and bi,hBN (i = 1, 2) are, respectively, the re-

and of the hBN slab (see Fig. 1). Notice that if the
boron nitride slab is formed by an even number of lay-
· σx for ThBN,tg,
ers, one must replace Rn
since boron and nitrogen atoms switch positions in con-
secutive layers of hBN. Diﬀerent reciprocal lattice vec-
tors are related to each other by bi,tg = R(θtg) · bi,bg
and bi,hBN = (ag/ahBN)R(θhBN) · bi,bg, where ag/ahBN
is a scale factor, with ag (ahBN) the lattice parameter of
graphene (hBN). Hamiltonians of the form of Eq. (5)
have previously been used to study twisted graphene
bilayers14,38–40 and graphene-on-hBN structures35,36,41.
Considering the three processes coupling the bottom
graphene with hBN and the three processes connecting
hBN to the top graphene layer, described by Eq. (5),
there are nine hBN mediated processes coupling the bot-
tom graphene layer to the top one24. These nine pro-
cesses couple a state from the bottom graphene layer with
momentum k (measured from τ Kbg) to states of the top
graphene layer with momentum k + τQn,m (measured
from τ Ktg) with (see Appendix B)
Qn,m = ∆Kb,t + gbg,hBN

, n, m = 0, 1, 2. (11)
The processes with n (cid:54)= m involve transfer of momentum
by the hBN lattice, while processes with n = m do not.
At zero magnetic ﬁeld, the overall three-fold rotational
invariance of the graphene-hBN-graphene structure im-
plies that these nine processes can be organized in three
groups of three, with processes in the same group being
related by 2π/3 rotation and therefore giving the same
contribution to the vertical current. The three groups
are

B. Current evaluation

The standard approach to transport in a mesoscopic
device assumes that the device is attached to external
contacts that are in a thermal equilibrium state with well
deﬁned chemical potentials. This is only an approxima-
tion as once a current starts ﬂowing through the system,
the contacts will also be in a non-equilibrium state43,44.
The problem of computing the current ﬂowing through
a mesoscopic device is then analogous to the problem
of computing the water ﬂux through a thin pipe that is
connecting two large vessels with diﬀerent water levels45.
Once water starts ﬂowing through the pipe, the water
levels in each vessel are no longer constants, however, on
short time scales, assuming that the water levels in the
vessels are constant is a reasonable approximation, pro-
vided that these are wide enough with respect to the pipe.
In the same way, within short time scales compared to the
depletion time of an external battery, it is a reasonable
approximation to assume that the external contacts have
well deﬁned, constant chemical potentials. Using the
non-equilibrium Green’s function technique one can then
show that in a mesoscopic device that is attached to two
non-interacting46 contacts, bottom and top, in thermal
equilibrium state described, respectively, by the Fermi-

Dirac distribution functions fb(ω) = (cid:2)eβ(ω−µb) + 1(cid:3)−1
and ft(ω) =(cid:2)eβ(ω−µt) + 1(cid:3)−1

with µb(t) the chemical po-
tential of the bottom (top) contact, the current ﬂowing
from the bottom to the top contact is given by47 (using
a compact notation where a capital bold face symbols

III. CURRENT IN THE NON-INTERACTING,

PRISTINE LIMIT

A. General discussion

When applying the non-equilibrium Green’s func-
tion formalism to a graphene-hBN-graphene device with
metal contacts, one is faced with the issue of how to
make the separation between central mesoscopic region,
and the external contacts which are in thermal equilib-
rium. Two natural approaches exist: (A) describing the
graphene layers as part of the external contacts, and
(B) describing the graphene layers as part of the cen-
tral mesoscopic device. In all theoretical analytic works
to date, the graphene layers were assumed to be part of
the external contacts23,24,27,49,50, being in equilibrium.
However, due to the low density of states of graphene,
it seems more natural to consider graphene as part of
the mesoscopic device. We will start from approach (B)
and see that under certain approximations, it reduces to
approach (A). We will ﬁrst consider the non-interacting,
pristine case. In approach (B), GR/A(ω) in Eq. (27) is the
Green’s function of the graphene-hBN-graphene device.
We are interested in the matrix elements of GR/A that
connect the bottom and the top contacts. Due to the
block diagonal structure of the Hamiltonian (1) (there
is no direct coupling between the two graphene layers),
these can generally be written as

b,t = G0,R

that in the non-interacting case both approaches (A) and
(B) coincide. We will leave the discussion for tunneling
in the presence disorder and electron-phonon interactions
to the next section.

In order to make analytic progress, we will employ
the wide-band limit for the metallic contacts, neglect-
ing any frequency dependence of Γb/t, and assume that
the contacts couple equally to all graphene states, not
spoiling translation invariance. We expect that this last
approximation works well for cases where the metallic
contacts are deposited on a small region of the graphene
sample. Within these approximations, the only eﬀect of
the metallic contacts is to introduce a broadening fac-
tor of γbg/tg = Γb/t/2 in the Green’s function of the
bottom/top graphene layer. We will now write T for
a graphene-hBN-graphene device more explicitly. Us-
ing the graphene-hBN coupling Hamiltonian Eq. (5), the
transmission function can be written using the Bloch mo-
mentum basis as (writing explicitly the frequency argu-
ment)

which only depends of the graphene’s dispersion rela-
tion and wavefunctions (for simplicity we have dropped
the valley indice τ ). In the limit of inﬁnite lifetime for
graphene electrons, the spectral functions reduce to δ-
functions and it is possible to provide an analytic ex-
pression for TDoSn,m(ωbg, ωtg). In the presence of a ﬁ-
nite, momentum independent, lifetime, it is still possible
to ﬁnd an approximate analytic expression to Eq. (40).
These analytic expressions lead to a signiﬁcant speed up
in the evaluation of the current and are presented in Ap-
pendix C. The presence of the spectral functions for the
bottom and top graphene layers leads to conservation of
energy and momentum in the tunneling process between
the two graphene layers.

B. Results

The tunneling in a graphene-hBN-graphene structure
is controlled both by energy-momentum conservation
and by Pauli’s exclusion principle. The constrains im-
posed by energy-momentum conservation can be under-
stood considering that the Dirac cones of the bottom and
top graphene layers are shifted in energy by a value of
F,tg + eVbias − F,bg and in momentum by a value of
|Qn,m|, see Fig. 3. The intersection of the shifted cones
allows one to visualize the states which respect energy-
momentum conservation24. Whenever the bias voltage is
tuned such that

F,tg + eVbias − F,bg = vF |Qn,m| ,

(41)

there is a complete overlap of the Dirac cones and
a maximum in the current occurs. The information
regarding energy-momentum conservation for an elec-
tron tunneling between the two graphene layers is en-
coded in the the TDoSn,m function.
In Fig. 2 we
plot the quantity TDoSn,m(ω − εn,mvF |Qn,m| /2, ω +
εn,mvF |Qn,m| /2),
for diﬀerent values of εn,m =
(F,tg + eVbias − F,bg) / (vF |Qn,m|). For ε2
n,m < 1, the
tunneling is due to intraband processes (from the con-
duction/valence band of the bottom graphene into the
conduction/valence band of the top graphene), going to

ciple in the vertical current of a graphene-hBN-graphene de-
vice. The two cones represent the dispersion relation for
electrons of the bottom and top graphene layers. The shad-
owed blue regions represent the occupation of electronic states
in both graphene layers. Energy-momentum conservation is
only satisﬁed when the two shifted Dirac cones intersect and
the energy windows where this occurs are represented by the
dashed arrows. The following cases are represented: (a) Only
intraband are possible, εn,m < 1, these are however Pauli
blocked or there are no states available, therefore in the low
temperature limit, no vertical current ﬂows. (b) Threshold
bias voltage above which intraband processes which satisfy
energy-momentum conservation appear in the energy window
where tunneling is allowed by the electronic occupation fac-
tors. (c) Condition which corresponds to the occurrence of a
peak in the current, when εn,m = 1, when both intraband and
interband (conduction-to-valence and valence-to-conduction)
processes are allowed. (d) If one further increases the bias
voltage, only interband tunneling, εn,m > 1, becomes possi-
ble and the current diminishes.

For ε2
n,m > 1, the tunneling is due to interband pro-
cesses (from the conduction/valence band of the bot-
tom graphene layer to the valence/conduction band
of the top graphene layer), being zero in the pristine

current23,24, which is made ﬁnite with the introduction
of a ﬁnite electronic lifetime. Since for diﬀerent processes
(n, m) with diﬀerent |Qn,m| there is a diﬀerent eﬀective
separation in momentum between the Dirac cones of the

rence of multiple peaks in the I-V curve, followed by sub-
sequent regions of negative diﬀerential conductance. This
is indeed the case as shown in Fig. (4). Based only on
energy-momentum conservation, one would expect the
occurrence of three peaks in the I-V curve for positive
bias voltage and another three for negative bias (notice
that according to the discussion of Sec. II A from the nine
processes coupling the two graphene layers, only three
are independent). This is indeed the case as shown in
Fig. (4). However, the computed curve only displays two
peaks, with the peaks corresponding to the situations
when and ε0,2 = −1 being absent. The reason for the
suppression of these peaks is due to the spinorial struc-
ture of graphene electronic wavefunctions, via the overlap

multiple NDC regions has not. This might be due to the
fact that the position of the current peaks depends very
sensitively in the rotation angles θtg and θhBN. This is
exempliﬁed in Fig. 5, where the computed I-V curves for
several rotation angles are shown. As shown, for a ﬁxed
angle of θtg = 1◦, changing θhBN from 1.5◦ to 3◦ moves
the additional peaks in the current due to the transfer of

contribute to the current if these lie in an energy win-

It is
precisely in this case that that the reconstruction of the
graphene dispersion relations becomes important at low
energy. The eﬀect of this reconstruction should impact
not only the peaks that involve transference of momen-
tum by the hBN lattice (n (cid:54)= m), but also the ones that
do not (n = m). In this situation one can question the
validity of the results from these section. However, we
argue that the possible reconstruction of the graphene
dispersion relations, should not aﬀect in a profound way
the occurrence of peaks and NDC in the I-V curves of
graphene-hBN-graphene devices. The energy width, ∆,
where the reconstruction of the linear dispersion relation
of graphene is signiﬁcant is of the order of the tens of
meV17,54, while the total energy window of states that
contribute to the current is, at low temperatures, of the
width of ∼ eVbias. Provided the condition eVbias/∆ (cid:29) 1
is satisﬁed (see Fig. (8)), we expect that the eﬀect of
the dispersion relation reconstruction is negligible, and
apart from a possible reduction of the height of the peaks,
should not aﬀect the current in any drastic way.

of Fig. 6. At higher temperatures, all these sharp features
tend to vanish, as the Fermi-Dirac occupation factors be-
come smoother.

By applying an in-plane magnetic ﬁeld, the three-
fold rotational invariance of the graphene-hBN-graphene
structure is broken, and therefore, the processes cor-
responding to the diﬀerent groups in (12) will con-
tribute diﬀerently to the current, and one expects
that each peak in the I-V curve will

three. An in-plane magnetic ﬁeld of the form B =
B (cos φB, sin φB, 0) can be described by the vector po-
tential A = Bz (sin φB,− cos φB). Neglecting the mo-

Finally, we comment the possible eﬀect of the hBN

and as such the last two terms of Eq. (49) cancel each
other. This cancellation is required since in a steady
state no charge accumulation can occur in the device
and therefore, the current ﬂowing from the top to the
bottom contact should satisfy It→b = −It→b. As such,
terms that involve only the occupation factor of one the
contacts must cancel at the end of any calculation. Pro-
cesses assisted by a greater number of phonons can also
be obtained. Higher order corrections to Eq. (48) can be
obtained by iterating Eq. (47) using Eqs. (21) and (22).
Just as for the lowest order case, contributions involving
only occupation factors from one of the contacts cancel
each other. Therefore, the contribution to the incoherent
current assisted by n phonons can be written as

Notice that with respect to Eq. (49), we have made a
change of si → −si in the ﬁrst line and made a shift in the
frequency variable ω → ω + s1ωζ1 + ... + snωζn in the sec-
ond line of Eq. (52). Eqs. (52), (53) and (54) have a very
simple interpretation. The ﬁrst/second line of Eq. (52)
can be understood has the probability of an electron be-
ing injected from the bottom/top contact being collected
by the top/bottom contact, while being scattering by n
phonons during the contact to contact trip, with si = ±1
representing a phonon absorption/emission process. We
will now use this general formalism to study the eﬀect
of phonon scattering in vertical transport in a graphene-
hBN-graphene device. We will analyze separately the
eﬀect of scattering by graphene and hBN phonons.

1. Scattering by phonons in the graphene layers

We know return to the issue of the consequences of con-
sidering graphene as part of the external contacts or part
of the central mesoscopic region. We will ﬁrst study the
eﬀect of multiple scatterings of electrons in the graphene
layers by phonons (or impurities). We will ﬁrst focus on
scattering by phonons in the top graphene layer, with
scattering in the bottom layer being treated in the same
way. Using Eq. (53), the tunneling amplitude assisted
by n phonon scattering events in the the top graphene
layer can be written to lowest order in the graphene-hBN
coupling as

This can be compared with the spectral function of the

tg (ω) coincide with Eqs. (57)

with the top contact. Therefore, the sum of all incoherent
scattering processes occurring before the electron leaves
the graphene layer and the coherent contribution repro-
duces the spectral function of graphene taking into ac-
count electron-phonon interaction / disorder. The same
is true for scattering in the bottom graphene layer. No-
tice that in Eqs. (53) and (54) retarded/advanced Green’s
functions appear to the right/left of Γb. Nevertheless, by
using Eq. (18), the previous calculation can also be ap-
plied for scattering in the bottom graphene layer. We
have thus arrived to an important conclusion: the ex-

which would be the one obtained if we employed ap-
proach (A), actually already includes the eﬀect of mul-
tiple non-coherent scattering processes in the graphene
layers, provided Atg/bg(ω) are replaced with the respec-
tive expressions in the presence of phonon/disorder scat-
tering. We also point out that in the case of elastic scat-
tering due to disorder in the graphene layers, the result
from Eq. (63) can be obtained by performing disorder
averages of Eq. (33), see Appendix F. To lowest order in
the graphene-hBN coupling, Eq. (63) actually includes
all the possible scattering processes of an electron in the
graphene layers. Including the eﬀects of graphene into
the Green’s function of hBN that appears in Tbg,tg(ω),
Eq. (63) includes only a subclass of all possible contri-
butions due to electron-phonon interaction, see Fig. 9.
Therefore, we conclude that approaches (A) and (B) co-
incide to lowest order in the graphene-hBN coupling and
to higher order in this coupling, approach (A) can cor-
rectly capture a class of all the possible electron phonon
scatterings.

the current involving phonon scattering. The dots represent
the level width functions due to the bottom and top external
metallic contacts, the squares represent the graphene-hBN

are resumed in Eq. (63). To lowest order in the graphene-

the graphene layers is included into GhBN. (c) Higher order
diagrams in the graphene-hBN coupling, including electron-
phonon interaction in the graphene layers, that is not included
in Eq. (63) and more generically cannot be captured when
evaluating the current following approach (A).

where, under the approximation that the top graphene is
in equilibrium with the top contact, the decay rate due
to electron-phonon interaction can be written as

cesses where there is a complete degradation of in-plane
momentum conservation, something that has been pre-
viously pointed out in Refs. 24 and 27. The complete
degradation of momentum conservation only occurs for
scattering by dispersionless phonons or for disorder with
short distance correlation.

B. Results

In Fig. 10 we show the vertical current as a func-
tion of bias voltage taking into account the eﬀect of
scattering of graphene electrons by resonant scatterers
(treated within the SCBA, see Appendix D) and in-plane
graphene electrons (see Appendix E). For comparison we
also show current computed used a constant relaxation
time. The main diﬀerence between modeling electron
scattering with a constant relaxation rate or considering
scattering by resonant scatters, is that for resonant scat-
ters the electron decay rate has a strong dependence in
energy, behaving as ω−1. Therefore, for higher bias volt-
ages (when the graphene Fermi levels are higher), the
electron lifetime is larger. This is manifest in Fig. 10,
where it is seen that when assuming a constant relaxation
rate the second peak in the I-V current is considerably
smaller than the ﬁrst one, while for resonant scatterers
both peaks are roughly the same height.
Inclusion of
phonons, makes again the peak at higher bias voltage
smaller due to the fact that the decay rate due to scat-
tering with graphene in-plane optical phonons increases
with frequency. Also notice that inclusion of resonant
disorder and phonons leads to a small splitting of the
peaks in the I-V current. This splitting is due to real
part of the self-energy due to both resonant scatterers
and phonons. Apart from increasing graphene electron’s
decay rate and as such providing an additional broad-
ening of peaks in the I-V current, phonons do not play
a relevant role for the high bias I-V characteristics of
a graphene-hBN-graphene device. This changes if one
focus on small bias. At very low temperature, the spon-
taneous emission of optical phonons becomes possible

Figure 10. I-V curves at constant Vgate = 0 in a graphene-
hBN-graphene device with rotations angles θtg = 1◦ and
θhBN = 1.5◦, considering diﬀerent sources of scattering in
the graphene layers: (RT) constant relaxation time of γ = 3
meV; (Imp) scattering by resonant scatterers treated within
the SCBA with an impurity concentration of nimp = 10−4 im-
purities per graphene unit cell; (Imp+RT) scattering by res-
onant scatterers and graphene in-plane optical phonons also
with nimp = 10−4.

whenever Vbias > ωOph, where ωOph is the optical phonon
frequency, opening up new tunneling channels for elec-
trons. Although for small electron-phonon coupling, this
phonon assisted contribution to the current is small the
opening up of a new tunneling channel can be observed
in the derivatives of the current with respect to the bias,
as can be seen in Fig. 11. The features in d2I/dV 2
bias are
only signiﬁcant at low temperature, being smoothed out
at higher temperatures due to the smearing of the Fermi
occupation factors in graphene. We point out however,
that the features due to phonons are a small contribu-
tion can be overridden due to features in the coherent
current induced by the rotation between diﬀerent lay-
ers (shown in Fig. 6), even if we treat the phonons as
dispersionless leading to a complete degradation of elec-
tron momentum conservation. We also note in passing,
that tunneling assisted by emission of multiple phonons
is also possible (see Eqs. (52)-(54)) which would open up
new scattering channels when nωOph > Vbias, where n is
the number of phonons. These would lead to additional
peaks in d2I/dV 2
bias but would be instead suppressed by
higher powers of the electron-phonon coupling.

fore, the observation of multiple NDC in graphene-hBN-
graphene devices requires a control of the rotational an-
gle between the diﬀerent layers with a precision of (cid:46) 1◦,
something which is within experimental reach21,23,60. We
expect that the possible reconstruction of graphene spec-
trum due to the periodic potential induced by hBN for
small rotational angles should not aﬀect in a qualitative
way the occurrence of multiple NDC regions in graphene-
hBN-graphene devices, provided the applied bias voltage
is much larger than the width of the region where the
spectrum reconstruction is signiﬁcant. However, a more
quantitative treatment of these eﬀects is required.

We have also analyzed the eﬀect of treating graphene
as being the source and drain contacts of the graphene-
hBN-graphene device, or by treating them as part of the
device and taking the source and drain as being external
metallic contacts. We have seen that, provided the metal-
lic contacts do not signiﬁcantly spoil translation invari-
ance of graphene (as expected if the contact is deposited
only over a small region of the graphene layer), and in the
non-interacting case, both approaches are equivalent. In
the presence of interactions both approaches are equiva-
lent to lowest order in the graphene-hBN coupling.

Finally, we have studied, in a uniﬁed way, the eﬀect of
scattering by disorder and phonon scattering in the ver-
tical current of graphene-hBN-graphene devices. Start-
ing from a NEGF formalism we derived the contribu-
tion to the current due to phonon (or disorder) assisted
tunneling processes. We have seen now scattering by
short range disorder or dispersionless phonons leads to
a complete degradation of electron momentum conserva-
tion in the graphene-to-graphene tunneling process and
how spontaneous emission of phonons at lower temper-
ature appear as sharp features in the derivatives of the
current with respect to the bias voltage at the energy of
the phonons. These features can however be hidden by
features due to the rotational alignment between the dif-
ferent layers. We have focused on the eﬀect of graphene
in-plane optical phonons and hBN optical out-of-plane
breathing phonons. We have not considered the eﬀect of
vibrations at the graphene-hBN interface, as these would
require the description of phonons in incommensurate
structures something which will be focus of future work.

V. CONCLUSIONS

This works provides another example of the extreme
sensitivity of the properties of vdW structures to the
rotational alignment of the diﬀerent constitutive lay-
ers. We have seen how this additional degree of free-
dom can be exploited in order to create devices display-
ing multiple regions of negative diﬀerential conductance.
The development of devices that display multiple NDC
regions is relevant for the development of multivalued
logic devices58,59, which showcases another possible ap-
plication of vdW structures. We have studied in de-
tail the eﬀect of the rotational alignment between the
boron nitride slab and the graphene layers in the verti-
cal current of a graphene-hBN-graphene vdW structure
for small rotational misalignment, which have so far not
been observed23. We have seen now the transference of
momentum by the hBN crystalline structure to the tun-
neling electrons gives origin to additional peaks in the I-V
characteristics of this device, followed by regions of neg-
ative diﬀerential conductance. These additional peaks
are however extremely sensitive to the rotation angle be-
tween the graphene layers and the hBN slab, and rota-
tional angles as small as 3◦ can already push these addi-
tional peaks to bias voltages higher than 1.5 V. There-

order to eliminate the charge in the Si gate ρ−1. This is

(cid:96) = 0 layers and a bias voltage between the (cid:96) = N + 1and

Now, we assume that the vertical current ﬂowing between
the two graphene layers is small enough, such that we can
assume that these are in a near equilibrium state. Fur-
thermore, we employ the Thomas-Fermi approximation,
in which the local Fermi level for each layer is given by
F,(cid:96) = V H
(cid:96) , where F,(cid:96) is a function of the local carrier
density. This together with Eq. (A8) becomes a system of
non-linear equations in the carrier density / local Fermi
level.

It can be checked, that due to the large band gap of
hBN, most charge density will be accumulated in the
graphene layers. As such we approximate n(cid:96) = 0, for

Figure 12. Computed Fermi levels for the bottom and top
graphene layers as a function of bias voltage for diﬀerent gate
voltages obtained by solving Eqs. (A9) and (A10). We assume
that the following parameters dSiO2 = 285 nm, dhBN = 40
nm for the thickness of the back gate dielectric, with out-of-
plane dielectric constants ¯SiO2 = 3.9 and ¯hBN = 5.0933. We
assumed that the distance between the two graphene layers
are separated by 4 monolayers of hBN, which corresponds to
a distance between the graphene layers of d (cid:39) 1.6 nm.

Appendix A: Thomas-Fermi modeling of

electrostatic doping

We wish to model the charging of an a graphene-hBN-
graphene device by application of a gate, Vgate, and bias,
Vbias, voltages. The graphene-hBN-graphene structure is
formed by N hBN monolayers, sandwiched between two
graphene layers. The graphene-hBN-graphene structure
is on top of a dielectric spacer (typically hBN/SiO2) sep-
arating the structure from a back gate, typically a highly
doped Si layer. We treat each layer forming the graphene-
hBN-graphene structure as a 2D ﬁlm with a two dimen-
sional charge density given by ρ(cid:96), (cid:96) = −1, ...,N +1, where
(cid:96) = −1 indexes the Si layer, (cid:96) = 0 and (cid:96) = N + 1 are,
respectively, the bottom and top graphene layers and
(cid:96) = 1, ...,N index the layers of hBN slab. Layers (cid:96) − 1
and (cid:96) are separated by a distance d(cid:96) and we assume that
this is ﬁlled with a dielectric with relative constant along
the z direction given by given by ¯(cid:96). Applying Gauss’s
law around each plate, and assuming charge neutrality,

Appendix B: Interlayer hopping Hamiltonian

between non-commensurate layers

T(cid:96),(cid:96)(cid:48) = − (cid:88)

We describe the graphene-boron nitride coupling
using the general theory of coupling between non-
commensurate layers of Refs. 22 and 37. We wish to
describe the coupling between two 2D crystals, labeled
as (cid:96) and (cid:96)(cid:48), with Bravais lattices spanned by {a1,(cid:96), a2,(cid:96)}
and {a1,(cid:96)(cid:48), a2,(cid:96)(cid:48)}, respectively. In a tight-binding repre-
sentation the interlayer hopping between layers (cid:96) and (cid:96)(cid:48)
can be written as

where Gn,(cid:96)/(cid:96)(cid:48) are reciprocal lattice vectors of the 2D
crystal (cid:96)/(cid:96)(cid:48). The Kronecker-δ imposes that in a inter-
layer hoping process, momentum is conserved modulo
any combination of reciprocal lattice vectors of both lay-
ers. In general, t(cid:96),(cid:96)(cid:48)
a,b (q) will decay for large values of |q|,
and therefore only the processes with smallest |k + Gn,(cid:96)|
need be considered.
We now specialize to the case where (cid:96)(cid:48) is a graphene
layer and (cid:96) is a boron nitride layer. The graphene
unit cell contains two carbon atoms in the unit cell, A
and B, while boron nitride contains one boron atom, B,
and one nitrogen atom, N, in the unit cell, see Fig. 1.
We will focus on low energy states, which lie close to
the Dirac points, ±Kg, of the graphene layer. Con-
sidering only the three most relevant processes cou-
pling the graphene and boron nitride layers, we must
consider processes involving Gn,g = 0, b2,g,−b1,g and
Gn,hBN = 0, b2,hBN,−b1,hBN for states close to the Kg
point and processes involving Gn,g = 0,−b2,g, b1,g and
Gn,hBN = 0,−b2,hBN, b1,hBN for states close to the −Kg
It is also assumed that the momentum depen-
point.

In order to describe the coupling between the bottom
and top graphene layers to a slab formed by N hBN
monolayers, we notice that the products of unit cell ba-
sis vectors and reciprocal lattice vectors that appears
in Eq. (B4) can be written for the bottom graphene
layer as τ hBN,B1 · Gn,hBN = τ bg,A · Gn,bg = 0 and
τ hBN,N1 · Gn,hBN = τ bg,B · Gn,bg = ±n2π/3 (for states
close to ±Kg point). For the coupling between the top

a,b (K), setting :thBN,g

N,A (K) = thBN,g

graphene layer and the N th hBN layer, one must con-
sider separately the cases when the hBN slab is formed
by and even or odd number of layers. For an odd number
of layers, in the N th layer the boron and nitrogen atoms
occupy the same positions as in the 1st layer and there-
fore we still have τ hBN,BN·Gn,hBN = τ tg,A·Gn,tg = 0 and
τ hBN,NN · Gn,hBN = τ tg,B · Gn,tg = ±n2π/3. If we have
an even number of hBN layers, then in the N th layer, the
boron an nitrogen atoms switch positions compared to
the 1st layer, and one obtains instead τ hBN,NN·Gn,hBN =
τ tg,A · Gn,tg = 0 and τ hBN,BN · Gn,hBN = τ tg,B · Gn,tg =
±n2π/3 ∓ n2π/3. With these approximations, one ob-
tains Eq. (5) of the main text.

Appendix D: Resonant impurities within the SCBA

We consider the eﬀect of resonant impurities, such as
vacancies, in the properties of graphene. We focus on
this kind of impurities due to the possibility for analyti-
cal progress and due to the fact that this model for impu-
rities correctly predicts a transport lifetime in graphene
that depends on the Fermi energy as τtr(F ) ∝ F
32.
Resonances due to short range disorder cannot be taken
into account by treating then within a Gaussian approx-
imation. A way to overcome this limitation is to employ
the T-matrix, which properly takes into account multi-
ple scatterings by the same impurity in the limit of low
impurity concentration. Using the T-matrix within the
non-crossing approximation, the self-consistent Born ap-
proximation (SCBA) for the Green’s function of an iso-
lated graphene layer reads

Appendix E: Graphene electron self-energy due to

in-plane optical phonons

Electron-phonon interaction in graphene can be mod-
eled by starting from a nearest neighbour tight-binding
Hamiltonian for the electrons and assuming that the lat-
tice distortions due to phonons lead to a modulation
of hopping integrals61. For graphene longitudinal and
transverse in-plane phonons close to the Γ point and elec-
trons close to the K point the obtained electron-phonon
interaction Hamiltonian is given by

Appendix F: Vertex corrections for resonant

impurities

In this Appendix, we provide an alternative deriva-
tion of Eq. (63), for the vertical current in a graphene-
hBN-graphene device taking into account disorder in the
graphene layers, employing approach (B). Instead of de-
scribing disorder as an interaction, we will start from
Eq. (33) and perform disorder averages of it. Just as
in Appendix. D we will consider scattering by resonant
disorder. This model will both serve as a concrete exam-
ple for elastic scattering of the general results present in
Sec. IV regarding the equivalences of approaches (A) and
(B) and will also show the formal equivalence between the
contributions to the current arising from Eq. (28) and
vertex corrections. Just as in Sec. III we will assume for
simplicity that the external metallic contacts couple to
all graphene states and that graphene electronic states
are still well describe by Bloch states. With these ap-
proximations, we write

state and a lower indice represents an incoming state,
with repeated indices being summed over. With this con-

and therefore, the contributions from vertex corrections
(incoherent contributions) due to impurities adds to the
contribution coming from the product of two average
Green’s functions (coherent contribution), in such a way
that Eq. (F2) reduces to Eq. (34) of the main text. This
result is a particular case of the more general discussion
of Sec. IV A 1, which is not limited to elastic scattering.

42 In Ref. 24, the processes corresponding to Q0,1 and Q0,2
where identiﬁed as being equivalent, with |Q0,1| = |Q0,2|.
This was likely caused by ﬁrst expanding Qn,m to linear
order in θtg, θhBN and δ, and only then evaluating |Qn,m|,
loosing in the process terms involving the product δθtg in
|Qn,m|2, which lift the equivalence between the processes
associated with Q0,1 and Q0,2.

46 In mesoscopic transport, the problem of computing the
current that is ﬂowing through the device is reduced to a
problem only involving degrees of freedom in the meso-
scopic region by integrating out the external contacts.
This is only done exactly provided the contacts are non-
interacting.

is local
in time and as such does not give origin to
lesser/greater self-energy terms, contributing only to the
retarded/advanced self-energies.
