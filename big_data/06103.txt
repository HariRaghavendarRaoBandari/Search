FIXED POINT PROPORTIONS FOR GALOIS GROUPS OF

NON-GEOMETRIC ITERATED EXTENSIONS

J. JUUL

Abstract. Given a map ϕ : P1 → P1 of degree greater than 1 deﬁned
over a number ﬁeld k, one can deﬁne a map ϕp : P1(ok/p) → P1(ok/p)
for each prime p of good reduction, induced by reduction modulo p. It
has been shown that for a typical ϕ the proportion of periodic points
of ϕp should tend to 0 as |P1(ok/p)| grows. In this paper, we extend
previous results to include a weaker set of suﬃcient conditions under
which this property holds. We are also able to show that these conditions
are necessary for certain families of functions, for example, functions of
the form ϕ(x) = xd + c, where 0 is not a preperiodic point of this
map. We study the proportion of periodic points by looking at the ﬁxed
point proportion of the Galois groups of certain extensions associated
to iterates of the map.

1. Introduction

Let k be a ﬁeld and ϕ(x) a rational map of degree d greater than 1 with
coeﬃcients in k. Consider the function ϕn(x) − t, where ϕn(x) is the n-th
iterate of ϕ(x) and t is transcendental over k. If ϕn(x) − t is separable for
each n, adjoining the roots of ϕn(x) − t to k(t) gives us a Galois extension
of k(t).
In order to understand certain dynamic and number theoretic properties
of ϕ it is useful to understand the structure of the Galois groups of these
extensions (see for example, [Odo85][Jon08][Jon15][JKMT15][Juu16]). The
proportion of elements of the Galois group ﬁxing some root of ϕn(x) −
t, called the ﬁxed point proportion, is particularly useful in applications.
This paper generalizes some of the results from [JKMT15], which examines
proportions of periodic points by studying the ﬁxed point proportion of these
Galois groups.

If ϕ(x) has coeﬃcients in a number ﬁeld k, then for any prime p of ok (of
good reduction) we can consider the map ϕp : P1(ok/p) → P1(ok/p) induced
by reduction modulo p. Since P1(ok/p) is ﬁnite, the orbit of any point in
P1(ok/p) will be ﬁnite and hence must contain a cycle by the pigeonhole
principle. Thus, any point in P1(ok/p) is preperiodic under this map. It is
natural to ask: what proportion of elements of P1(ok/p) are periodic under
this map, that is, for what proportion of α ∈ P1(ok/p) does there exist n > 1
such that ϕn(α) = α?

Heuristics suggest that for a typical ϕ, we should expect the proportion
of ϕp-periodic points in P1(ok/p) to approach zero as |P1(ok/p)| to tends
inﬁnity (see [FO90][Bac91][Sil08][BGH+13]). In fact, in [JKMT15] we show
that for any degree d, this holds for all ϕ in a Zariski-open subset of the set
of rational functions of degree d. Moreover, in that paper we give speciﬁc
conditions which ensure that a rational function belongs to this set. The
conditions guarantee that the iterated extensions mentioned above are both
geometric and, in some sense, as large as possible. We call the extensions
geometric when the splitting ﬁelds of ϕn(x)− t over k(t) do not contain any
elements of ¯k \ k.
However, it is easy to ﬁnd examples of rational functions that do not
satisfy this property. For example, the map ϕp : P1(Fp) → P1(Fp) induced
by ϕ(x) = x3 + 1 is bijective whenever Fp does not contain a cube root of
unity, that is, whenever p 6≡ 1 mod 3. Thus, for these primes every point
is periodic under this map, which implies that the limit supremum of the
proportion of periodic points is one. This paper deals with cases like this,
where the extensions are non-geometric, but we still require the geometric
part of the extensions to be as large as possible.

Note, the rational maps that induce a bijection on P1(ok/p) for inﬁnitely
many primes p are rare in the sense that they belong to a special class
of maps called exceptional maps, which has been completely classiﬁed by
Guralnick, Muller, and Saxl [GMS03]. Their results generalize a conjecture
of Schur from 1923 [Sch23], proven by Fried in 1970 [Fri70], which states
that polynomials with this property are compositions of linear polynomials
and Dickson polynomials.

n(x) = 0 for all x. This implies (ϕn)′ = qnp′

In order to describe our results precisely we ﬁx some notation. Let k
be any ﬁeld and let ϕ(x) ∈ k(x) be a rational function with degree d > 1,
such that ϕ′(x) 6= 0. Then ϕn(x) − t is separable. To see this, let pn, qn ∈
k[x] be the numerator and denominator of ϕn(x) respectively. Note, the
roots of ϕn(x) − t are the roots of pn(x) − tqn(x), so we want to show that
pn(x)− tqn(x) is separable. Since pn(x)− tqn(x) is irreducible over k(t), if it
has a double root then we must have p′
n(x) = 0 for all x and hence
p′
n(x) = q′
= 0 for all x,
but since we assumed ϕ′(x) 6= 0, we have (ϕn)′(x) 6= 0 by induction on n.
Let Kn be the splitting ﬁeld of ϕn(x)−t over k(t) in some integral closure.
Let E = K1 ∩ k, G = Gal(K1/E(t)), Gn = Gal(Kn/E(t)), and Bn =
It is not too hard to show that Bn and Gn must each be
Gal(Kn/k(t)).
subgroups of [Sd]n the n-th iterated wreath product of Sd with itself [Odo85,
Lemma 4.1]. The possibilities for Bn and Gn can be restricted further.
Lemma 1.1. ([JKMT15, Lemma 3.3]) The group Bn is isomorphic to a
subgroup of [B1]n, the n-th iterated wreath product of B1. Similarly, Gn is
isomorphic to a subgroup of [G]n.

The following Theorem provides a set of conditions which ensure Gn ∼=

[G]n.

FIXED POINT PROPORTIONS FOR NON-GEOMETRIC ITERATED EXTENSIONS 3

Theorem 1.2. [JKMT15, Theorem 3.1] Suppose ϕ(x) ∈ k(x) is a rational
function of degree d ≥ 2 such that ϕ′(x) 6= 0. Fix N ∈ N and suppose there
is a subset S ⊆ ϕc such that the following holds:
(1) for any a ∈ S, b ∈ ϕc, and m, n ≤ N , we have ϕm(a) 6= ϕn(b) unless
(2) the group G is generated by the ramiﬁcation groups of the ϕ(a) for

a = b and m = n; and

a ∈ S, that is

(cid:10) [a∈S [p|ϕ(a)−t

I(p|ϕ(a) − t)(cid:11) = G.

in K1/E(t)

Then we have GN ∼= [G]N .

If the ﬁrst extension K1/k(t) is not geometric, that is, if k is not alge-
braically closed in K1, then Bn will not be a full iterated wreath product,
as is noted in the next proposition.

Proposition 1.3. ([JKMT15, Proposition 3.6]) Let B = Gal(K1/k(t)).
Suppose that k is not algebraically closed in K1, then Gal(Kn/k(t)) is a
proper subgroup of [B]n for n > 1.

In this case Gn ∼= [G]n, but B1 6∼= G, we can get information about the

ﬁxed point proportion of Bn by examining the factor group Bn/Gn.

Deﬁnition 1.4. Let H be any set acting on another set S, we deﬁne the ﬁxed
point proportion of H, denoted F P P (H), to be the proportion of elements
of H ﬁxing at least one element of S.

Using the same notation as above, we also let A = Gal(E/k). Thus, we
have Bn/Gn ∼= A for all n. For each a ∈ A we let (Bn)a denote the elements
of Bn whose restriction to E is a. Then if σ is any element of (Bn)a we have
(Bn)a = Gnσ. With ϕ as above, we can consider the action of any subset of
Bn on the roots of ϕn(x) − t.
Theorem 1.5. The following hold:

(1) If each coset of B1/G has some ﬁxed point free element, then for any
ǫ there exists Nǫ, depending only on d, such that for any ϕ satisfying
GNǫ ∼= [G]Nǫ, we have that FPP((BN )a) < ǫ for each a ∈ A, and
hence FPP(BNǫ) < ǫ.
(2) If there is some coset Gσ ∈ B1/G such that each element of Gσ has
a ﬁxed point, then for any N such that GN ∼= [G]N , FPP((BN )a) = 1
where a = σ|E, and hence FPP(BN ) > 1
|A| .

We prove this theorem in Section 2. Then in Section 3 we apply this
result to the question of proportions of periodic points over ﬁnite ﬁelds.
For example, we show that if f (x) = xd + c has the property that 0 is not
preperiodic over a number ﬁeld k, then the ﬁxed point proportion of f (x)
over P1(ok/p) tends to zero as |P1(ok/p)| goes to inﬁnity if and only if k
contains an ℓ-th root of unity for some ℓ > 1 dividing d.

2. Fixed Point Proportions

The arguments in this sections are similar to, but more general than,

those of Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3 in [Odo85].

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let Γ be a set of permutations acting on a ﬁnite set S.
The indicatrix of Γ is given by

ΦΓ(x) :=

1

|Γ|Xγ∈Γ

xtr γ

where tr γ := #{s ∈ S : γ(s) = s}.
Lemma 2.2. Let a ∈ A = Gal(E/k). If Gn ∼= [G]n, then

Φ(Bn)a(x) = Φn

(B1)a(x).

= |(B1)a|dn−1

Proof. By Lemma 1.1, we can embed Bn in [B1]n. Thus, identifying (Bn)a
with its image, we can write any σ ∈ (Bn)a as (π; τ1, . . . , τdn−1 ) ∈ ([B1]n−1)[B1]
where π ∈ Bn−1 ∼= [B1]n−1 and τi ∈ B1. More speciﬁcally, since σ restricts
to a on E we must have π ∈ (Bn−1)a and τi ∈ (B1)a. Also, since Gn ∼= [G]n
we have [Kn : Kn−1] = |G|dn−1
, so a simple degree argu-
ment shows (Bn)a = {(π; τ1, . . . , τdn−1 ) : π ∈ (Bn−1)a, τi ∈ (B1)a}. Let
S = {α1, . . . , αdn−1} be the set of roots of f n−1(x) − t. Then, we have
Prob(cid:0) tr σ = k(cid:1) =Xl
=Xl
=Xl

Prob(cid:0) tr(π; τ1, . . . , τdn−1 ) = k | tr π = l(cid:1) Prob(cid:0) tr π = l(cid:1)
Prob(cid:18) Xαi∈S
Prob(cid:0) tr τ1 + . . . + tr τl = k | τj ∈ (B1)a(cid:1) Prob(cid:0) tr π = l(cid:1).

tr τi = k | tr π = l(cid:19) Prob(cid:0) tr π = l(cid:1)

π(αi)=αi

Clearly, for any set Γ, ΦΓ(x) =Pk Prob(cid:0) tr γ = k(cid:1)xk, so
Φ(Bn)a (x) =Xk Xl

Prob(cid:0) tr τ1 + . . . + tr τl = k | τj ∈ (B1)a(cid:1) Prob(cid:0) tr π = l(cid:1)xk
Prob(cid:0) tr τ1 + . . . + tr τl = k | τj ∈ (B1)a(cid:1)xk
Prob(cid:0) tr τ = m | τ ∈ (B1)a(cid:1)xm(cid:19)l

Prob(cid:0) tr π = l(cid:1)Xk
Prob(cid:0) tr π = l(cid:1)(cid:18)Xm
Prob(cid:0) tr π = l(cid:1)(cid:0)Φ(B1)a(x)(cid:1)l

Thus, Φ(Bn)a(x) = Φn

(B1)a

(x) by induction on n.

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.5. As noted above, for any set Γ, we have

ΦΓ(x) =Xk

Prob(tr γ = k)xk

so the constant term of ΦΓ(x) is the proportion of elements of Γ with no
ﬁxed points.

First we suppose there is some a ∈ A such that each element of (B1)a
has a ﬁxed point. Let Φ(x) := Φ(B1)a(x), then Φ(0) = 0 so Φn(0) = 0
for all n. Since GN ∼= [G]N we can apply Lemma 2.2 which implies that
every σ ∈ (BN )a must have a ﬁxed point. Thus, FPP((BN )a) = 1 and
FPP(BN ) > |(BN )a|

|BN | = 1
|A| .

Now consider the case where (B1)a has some ﬁxed point free element for
each a ∈ A. Fix an a in A, and again let Φ(x) := Φ(B1)a(x). We will show
limn→∞ Φn(0) = 1.
First, we show Φ′(1) = 1. Note, for any σ ∈ (B1)a we have (B1)a = Gσ.

and only if gg0 ∈ {g ∈ G|gσα = α}. Thus |{g ∈ G|gσα = α}| = | StabG(α)|,

since G is transitive.

It is easy to see that Φ(1) = 1

second derivatives of Φ(x) are positive on (0, 1], so the graph of Φ(x) is
concave up and increasing on (0, 1].

Since (B1)a has some ﬁxed point free element, Φ(0) > 0. So the graph of
Φ(x) must lie above the graph of y = x on the interval [0, 1). Thus, 0 ≤ x <
Φ(x) < 1 for 0 ≤ x < 1. Then {Φn(0)}n is a strictly increasing sequence
and is bounded above by 1 so it must converge. Since limn→∞ Φn(0) must
be a ﬁxed point of Φ(x), this limit must be 1.

Fix ǫ > 0. For each transitive subgroup H of Sd and σ in Sd such that Hσ
has some element with no ﬁxed points, the above argument implies there is
n(H,σ)(0) > 1 − ǫ. Let N be the maximum of
some n(H, σ) such that ΦHσ
all n(H, σ) taken over all (H, σ) where H is a transitive subgroup of Sd and
σ ∈ Sd such that Hσ has an element with no ﬁxed points.

Then for each a, taking any σ ∈ (B1)a we have
FPP((BN )a) = (1 − Φ(BN )a(0)) = (1 − Φ(B1)a
This implies

N (0)) = (1 − ΦGσ

FPP(BN ) =

FPP((BN )a) < ǫ.

The following lemma from [Odo85], which will also be used in the proof
our main theorem on proportions of periodic points follows as an immediate
corollary to Theorem 1.5.
Corollary 2.3. ([Odo85, Lemma 4.3]) If Gn ∼= [G]n for all n, then

lim
n→∞

FPP(Gn) = 0.

Proof. By Theorem 1.5 it suﬃces to show that G must contain a ﬁxed point
free element. To see this, note that by Burnside’s lemma

1

|G| Xg∈G

tr g = 1,

since G is transitive. So the average of tr g as g varies over G is 1, and G
contains an element, namely the identity, with trace d > 1. Thus, G must
contain an element with trace 0.
(cid:3)

3. Proportions of Periodic Points

Let ϕ(x) be a rational function of degree d > 1 deﬁned over a number
ﬁeld k. Write ϕ(x) = p(x)/q(x), where p(x), q(x) ∈ k[x], and let P (X, Y )
and Q(X, Y ) be the degree d homogenizations of p and q respectively; that
is, P (X, Y ) = Y dp(X/Y ) and Q(X, Y ) = Y dq(X/Y ). Set P1 = P and
Q1 = Q and deﬁne Pn and Qn by Pn(X, Y ) = P (Pn−1(X, Y ), Qn−1(X, Y ))
and Qn(X, Y ) = Q(Pn−1(X, Y ), Qn−1(X, Y )) for n ≥ 1. Then, deﬁning
pk = Pk(X, 1) and qk = Qk(X, 1), any root of ϕn(x) − t is a root of
(1)

pn(x) − tqn(x),

which is a polynomial with coeﬃcients in k(t). If p is a nonzero prime in
the ring of integers ok, we say that the rational function ϕ(x), deﬁned as

FIXED POINT PROPORTIONS FOR NON-GEOMETRIC ITERATED EXTENSIONS 7

above, has good reduction at p if all of the coeﬃcients of p and q have p-adic
absolute value less than or equal to 1 and P (X, Y ) and Q(X, Y ) have no
common zeros [α, β] ∈ P1(ok/p).
For any prime p of ok of good reduction we consider the rational function
ϕp(x), the reduction of ϕ modulo p. We examine the proportion of elements
of P1(ok/p) which are periodic points of ϕp.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let T : U → U be any map of a set U to itself. For
u ∈ U deﬁne T 0(u) = u and T n = T (T n−1(u)). We say that u is periodic if
T k(u) = u for some k ∈ N and we say u is preperiodic if T k(u) is periodic
for some k ∈ Z≥0. We denote the set of periodic points Per(T ) if the set U
is clear from the context.

Let k be a number ﬁeld, let K = k(t), and let ϕ : P1

k be a rational
function. For n ∈ Z+, let Kn be a splitting ﬁeld of ϕn(x) − t over K,
Bn = Gal(Kn/K), En = Kn ∩ k, and Gn = Gal(Kn/En(t)) (note, this is
slightly diﬀerent from our earlier notation.)

k → P1

Proposition 3.2. Let δ > 0. There is a constant Mδ such that for all p
with N(p) > Mδ, we have

(2)

# Per(ϕp)
N(p) + 1 ≤ [En : k] FPP(Bn) + δ.

We begin by showing that if p is a prime of good reduction for ϕ, then
p (P1(ok/p))
the number of periodic points for ϕp is bounded above by #ϕn
for any n. This follows from a very general principle, which we now prove.
Lemma 3.3. If U is ﬁnite then every point of U is preperiodic and Per(T ) =
n=0T n(U ). In particular, # Per(T ) ≤ #T n(U ) for any positive integer n.
∩∞
Proof. Suppose U is ﬁnite and let u ∈ U . By the pigeonhole principle we
must have T m(u) = T n(u) for some m, n > 0 with m 6= n. Thus, u is
preperiodic.
Suppose u ∈ U is periodic, so we can write T k(u) = u for some k > 0.
Then for any n ∈ N, T nk(u) = u and we have u ∈ T nk(U ) = T n(T n(k−1)(U )) ⊆
T n(U ). Hence, u ∈ T n(U ) for all n.
n=0T n(U ). Then for each i there is some ai ∈ U with
T i(ai) = u. Since U is ﬁnite, the pigeonhole principle implies that there
exist i, j, with i < j, such that ai = aj. Then we have

Now suppose u ∈ ∩∞

u = T j(aj) = T j−i(T i(aj)) = T j−i(T i(ai)) = T j−i(u)

and hence u is periodic.

(cid:3)

In order to prove Proposition 3.2 we must consider how the Galois groups
of the splitting ﬁelds of iterates of rational maps behave under reduction.
The following two results from [Odo85] and [JKMT15] are in this direction.
Where convenient we use Gal(ψ(x)/K) to denote the Galois group of the
splitting ﬁeld of ψ(x) over K in some algebraic closure of K.

8

J. JUUL

Lemma 3.4. ([Odo85, Lemma 2.4]) Let A be an integrally closed domain
with ﬁeld of fractions K, let K ′ be any ﬁeld, and let ψ : A → K ′ be a ring
homomorphism. Deﬁne eψ : A[x] → K ′[x] by adxd + ad−1xd−1 + . . . + a0 7→
ψ(ad)xd +ψ(ad−1)xd−1 +. . .+ψ(a0). If f (x) = adxd +. . .+a0 is a polynomial
in A[x] with d ≥ 1 and ad /∈ ker(ψ), such that eψ(f (x)) is separable over
K ′ then f (x) is separable over K and Gal(eψ(f (x))/K ′) is isomorphic to a
subgroup of Gal(f (x)/K). Also, if eψ(f (x)) is irreducible over K ′ then f (x)

is irreducible over K.

Now, let R be a Noetherian integral domain of characteristic 0 and let A
be a ﬁnitely generated R-algebra that is an integrally closed domain. Let
h(x) ∈ A[x] be a nonconstant polynomial that is irreducible in F (A)[x].
Here F (D) denotes the ﬁeld of fractions of an integral domain D. Let
B = A[θ1, . . . , θn] where θi are the roots of h in some splitting ﬁeld for h
over F (A). Suppose that F (R) is algebraically closed in both F (A) and
F (B). For p ∈ Spec R, let (A)p denote A/pA ⊗R F (A/p) and let hp denote
the image of h ∈ (A)p[x] under the reduction map from A to (A)p.
Lemma 3.5. ([JKMT15, Proposition 4.1]) There is a nonempty Zariski-
dense open subset W of Spec R such that for p ∈ W , we have (A)p is an
integral domain, there is a bijection between the roots of h(x) and the roots
of hp(x), and the action of Gal(hp(x)/F ((A)p)) on the roots of hp(x) is
isomorphic to the action of Gal(h(x)/F (A)) on the roots of h(x).

We now ﬁx some notation that will be used in the proof of Proposition
3.2 and in the next lemma. Let p ∈ Spec ok be a prime of good reduction for
ϕ and let Fq denote its residue ﬁeld ok/p. We let ϕp denote the reduction
of ϕ modulo p, let (Kn)p denote the splitting ﬁeld of ϕn
p (x) − t, and let
Bn,p = Gal((Kn)p/Fq(t)).
Let τ be a degree one prime Fq(t), that is, a degree one prime in Fq[t]
or Fq[ 1
t ], such that τ does not ramify in (Kn)p. Then for each prime
m in (Kn)p lying over τ , there is a unique Frobenius element Frob(m/τ )
such that Frob(m/τ ) ﬁxes m and acts as x 7→ xq on the residue ﬁeld of
m. We let Frob(cid:16) (Kn)p/Fq(t)
(cid:17) denote the conjugacy class of Frob(m/τ ) in

τ

Gal((Kn)p/Fq(t)) (note that elements of this conjugacy class correspond to
′ ranges over all primes of (Kn)p lying over τ ). Let z be a
′/τ ) as m
Frob(m
root of ϕn
p (x) − t in (Kn)p and let S denote the conjugates of z in (Kn)p.
Lemma 3.6. Let α ∈ P1(Fq) such that the degree one prime corresponding
to α does not ramify in (Kn)p. There exists β ∈ P1(Fq) such that ϕn
p (β) = α
if and only if Frob(cid:16) (Kn)p/Fq(t)

(cid:17) has a ﬁxed point in S.

α

Proof. Let An be the integral closure of Fq[t] in (Kn)p. Then ABn,p
n = Fq[t];
that is, Fq[t] is the set of elements of An that are ﬁxed by every element of
Bn,p.

Likewise, working with the integral closure A′

Now, let (t − α) be a degree one prime in Fq[t] that does not ramify in
(Kn)p, and let D(m|(t − α)) be the decomposition group of a prime m in
(Kn)p that lies over (t − α). Then, by Lemma 3.2 of [GTZ07], the number
of degree one primes in Fq(t, z) = Fq(z) lying over (t − α) is equal to the
number of ﬁxed points of D(m|(t − α)) acting on S. That is, the number of
β ∈ P1(Fq) such that ϕn(β) = α is equal to the number of ﬁxed points of
D(m|(t − α)) acting on S.
t ] in (Kn)p, we see
that if τ is the prime at inﬁnity in Fq(t) (that is the prime ( 1
t ])
and τ does not ramify in (Kn)p, then the number of degree one primes in
Fq(t, z) = Fq(z) lying over τ is equal to the number of ﬁxed points of D(m|τ )
acting on S, where m is a prime of A′
Since decomposition groups over unramiﬁed primes are generated by Frobe-
nius elements, we see that for any α ∈ P1(Fq) that does not ramify in (Kn)p,
(cid:17)
p (β) = α if and only if Frob(cid:16) (Kn)p/Fq(t)
there exists β ∈ P1(Fq) such that ϕn

have oEn/q ∼= Fqm for some m ≥ 1, with m ≤ [En : k]. We identify oEn/q
with Fqm. Let eϕ be the image of ϕ in En(x), then eϕ has good reduction
mod q. We assumed En is algebraically closed in Kn, so we may apply
Lemma 3.5. Since any dense subset of Spec oEn contains all but ﬁnitely
many primes in Spec oEn, it follows from Lemma 3.5 that for all but ﬁnitely
many q ∈ Spec oEn, the action of Gal((Kn)q/Fqm(t)) on the roots of eϕn
q (x)−t
is isomorphic to the action of Gn on the roots of ϕn(x) − t, where (Kn)q is
the splitting ﬁeld for eϕn(x) − t over Fqm(t).
q − t and since En ⊂ Kn,
we have Fqm ⊂ (Kn)p, so (Kn)q ∼= (Kn)p Thus, for all but ﬁnitely many
p ∈ Spec ok, the action of Gn,p := Gal((Kn)p/Fqm(t)) on the roots of ϕn
p (x)−t
is isomorphic to the action of Gn on the roots of ϕn(x) − t.

for any α outside of R, there is a β in P1(Fq) such that ϕn

where c is the number of conjugacy classes of in Fix(Bn,p). The set of primes
over which ϕn
p ramiﬁes has size at most n(2 deg ϕ− 2) since ϕp ramiﬁes over
at most (2 deg ϕ − 2) points and ϕn
p can only ramify over these points and
their ﬁrst n − 1 iterates under ϕp. (Note that deg ϕp = deg ϕ since ϕ has
good reduction at p.)
The size of Bn,p can be bounded in terms of n and d, since it is a subgroup
of the symmetric group on dn elements. Thus, for any p of characteristic
greater than deg ϕ (this guarantees that there is no wild ramiﬁcation at
for ϕp), we see that g(Kn)p can be bounded in terms of deg ϕp and n by
Riemann-Hurwitz; for example,

Hence, by (4) there is an Mδ such that for all p with N(p) = q ≥ Mδ, we
have

g(Kn)p ≤ #Bn,pn(2 deg ϕp − 2).

so that Gn,p ∼= Gn, for all p with N (p) > Mδ.
Now we show m FPP(Bn,p) ≤ [En : k] FPP(Bn). First note,
= XGn,pσ∈Bn,p/Gn,p
FPP(Bn,p) = XGn,pσ∈Bn,p/Gn,p
By Lemma 3.4, Bn,p is isomorphic to a subgroup of Bn. Also, we assumed
Gn,p ∼= Gn and hence Bn,p/Gn,p is isomorphic to a subgroup of Bn/Gn. Thus
we have

Applying Lemma 3.3 then ﬁnishes our proof.

(cid:3)

We immediately deduce the following as a consequence Proposition 3.2.

Corollary 3.7. With notation as in Proposition 3.2, suppose that there is
some ℓ such that En = Eℓ for all n ≥ ℓ. Then, if limn→∞ FPP(Bn) = 0, we
have

If Gal(ϕn(x) − t/k(t)) ∼= [G]n for all n, where G = Gal(ϕ(x) − t/k(t))
then by Proposition 1.3 En = E1 for all n, and Corollary 3.7 allows us to
decide exactly when the proportion of periodic points of ϕp tends to zero
as N (p) tends to inﬁnity. This criteria is presented in the next theorem,
which extends Theorem 1.3 from [JKMT15]. Moreover, using Theorem 3.1
from [JKMT15] (Theorem 1.2 above), it is possible to ﬁnd speciﬁc examples
to which we can apply this criteria, the case ϕ(x) = xd + c where 0 is not
a preperiodic point of ϕ is treated in Proposition 3.11, this result extends
Proposition 6.4 [JKMT15] .

Theorem 3.8. Let ϕ be a rational function with degree d > 1 such that
Gal(ϕn(x) − t/k(t)) ∼= [G]n for all n, where G = Gal(ϕ(x) − t/k(t)). Then

(c) if there is some coset of Gal(ϕ(x) − t/k(t))/ Gal(ϕ(x) − t/k(t)) for

Lemma 3.9. ([JKMT15, Lemma 6.3]) Let k be a number ﬁeld, let ϕ ∈ k[x],

Let ψ : P1(Fq) → P1(Fq) be a rational function, B = Gal(ψ(x)− t/Fq(t)),
G = Gal(ψ(x) − t/Fqm(t)), where Fqm is the algebraic closure of Fq in the
splitting ﬁeld of ψ(x) − t. Then B/G is isomorphic to Gal(Fqm/Fq) and
hence B/G is cyclic.

Lemma 3.10. If every b ∈ B with < Gb >= B/G ﬁxes at least one root of
ψ(x) − t, then ψ : P1(Fq) → P1(Fq) is bijective.
Proof. This follows directly from [GTZ07], Lemma 4.3 and Proposition 4.4.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 3.8. As before we let Kn denote the splitting ﬁeld of
ϕn(x)− t over k(t). Let E denote the algebraic closure of k in K1, then G =
Gal(K1/E(t)). Since Gal(Kn/E(t)) ⊆ [G]n for all n, we have Gal(Kn/E(t)) =
Gal(Kn/k(t)) ∼= [G]n for all n. Thus, by Corollary 2.3 and Corollary 3.7,

lim

Then (a) follows from Lemma 3.9 and (b) follows from Theorem 1.5 and
Corollary 3.7.

Now suppose there is some σ ∈ Gal(K1/k(t)) such that every element of
the coset Gσ in Gal(K1/k(t))/ Gal(K1/E(t)) ﬁxes some root of ϕ(x)−t. Let
a be the restriction of σ to E. In the proof of Proposition 3.2, we saw that
for all but ﬁnitely many p ∈ Spec ok, the action of G1,p = Gal((K1)p/Fqm(t))
on the roots of ϕp(x) − t is isomorphic to the action of G on the roots of
ϕ(x)− t, where Fqm is the algebraic closure of ok/p in (K1)p, let U be the set
of such primes. Also, by the Chebotarev density theorem there is a positive
p (cid:17) = C, where C
proportion of unramiﬁed primes in ok such that Frob(cid:16) E/k
p (cid:17) = C, there is some
Let p be any prime in V ∩ U . Then since Frob(cid:16) E/k
prime q of E lying over p such that Frob(q/p) = a. Then since σ|E = a,
σ induces an automorphism σp of (K1)p over ok/p ∼= Fq which is also an
automorphism of oE/q. Let θ1, . . . , θd be the roots of ϕ(x) − t. Since p ∈ U ,
there is a bijection rp between {θ1, . . . , θd} and the roots of ϕp(x) − t, with
σp(rp(θi)) = rp(σ(θi)). Since there is some i such that σ(θi) = θi, we have

is the conjugacy class of a in Gal(E/k). Let V denote the set of primes with
this property.

σp(rp(θi)) = rp(σ(θi)) = rp(θi),

so σp ﬁxes a root of ϕp(x) − t.
Now, a = Frob(q/p) which implies σp restricts to the map x 7→ xq on
Fqm, and G1,pσp is a generating coset for B1,p/G1,p ∼= Gal(Fqm/Fq). Then,
Lemma 3.10 implies that ϕp : P1(ok/p) → P1(ok/p) is surjective. Thus, we
p is surjective for all n, so Per(ϕp) = P1(ok/p) by Lemma 3.3 and
see that ϕn

# Per(ϕp)

Since U ∩ V is inﬁnite, # Per(ϕp)

N (p)+1 = 1 for inﬁnitely many primes and we have

Proposition 3.11. Let k be a number ﬁeld, let d > 1, and let f (x) =
xd + c ∈ k[x] have the property that 0 is not preperiodic. Then

(a)

(cid:3)

lim inf
p→∞

# Per(fp)

= 0;

(b) if k contains a primitive ℓ-th root of unity for ℓ|d with ℓ > 1, then

we have

(c) if k does not contain a primitive ℓ-th root of unity for any ℓ|d with

ℓ > 1,

lim sup

p→∞

# Per(fp)
N(p) + 1

= 1.

Proof. Note, E = k(ζ) where ζ = ζd is d-th root of unity, and the splitting

ﬁeld of f (x)− t over k(t) is E(t)( d√t − c) which has degree d over E(t). The
prime t − c ramiﬁes completely in E(t)( d√t − c); thus, the Galois group is
generated by the ramiﬁcation group over t − c. Since the critical point 0 is
not preperiodic, we see then that the conditions of Theorem 1.2 are met for
all N . Thus, for any n, we have Gal((f n(x) − t)/E(t)) ∼= [Cd]n where Cd is
the cyclic group of order d, and (a) follows from Theorem 3.8.
Suppose k contains a primitive ℓ-th root of unity for ℓ|d, then ζ d/ℓ is ﬁxed
by any σ ∈ Gal(E/k). Let α = d√t − c be any d-th root of t − c. As noted
above, G = Gal(f (x) − t/E(t)) ∼= Cd, and the elements of G are deﬁned by
α 7→ ζ jα for 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1. Deﬁne σm by σm(ζ) = ζ m. Then, for each m
such that σm belongs to Gal(E/k) we get a coset {τm,j : 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1} in
B1/G where τm,j(ζ iα) = ζ mi+jα.
The homomorphism τm,j ﬁxes a root of f (x)− t if and only if τm,j(ζ iα) =
ζ iα for some 1 ≤ i ≤ d. This holds if and only if mi + j ≡ i mod d for some
1 ≤ i ≤ d if and only if d|(m − 1)i + j for some 1 ≤ i ≤ d. Since σm ﬁxes
ζ d/ℓ we must have m ≡ 1 mod ℓ so if j is relatively prime to ℓ there is no
i such that d|(m − 1)i + j, which means that τm,j is ﬁxed point free. Thus,
each coset {τm,j : 1 ≤ j ≤ d} has a ﬁxed point free element and by Theorem
3.8 (b) holds.
On the other hand, if k does not contain a primitive ℓ-th root of unity
for any ℓ > 1 dividing d, then the map σm deﬁned by ζ 7→ ζ m belongs to
Gal(E/k) for any m relatively prime to d. Note, d must be odd since if 2|d
the hypotheses for (c) cannot hold since clearly −1 ∈ k. Thus, (2, d) = 1
and the map deﬁned by ζ 7→ ζ 2 belongs to Gal(E/k). We will show that
each element of {τ2,j
: 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1} has a ﬁxed point. For any j,
τ2,j(ζ iα) = ζ 2i+jα so ζ iα is ﬁxed by τ2,j if and only if 2i + j ≡ i mod d,
which holds if and only if d|i + j, which must hold for some i between 0 and

14

d − 1. Thus, τ2,j has a ﬁxed point for each j. Hence, (c) also follows from
Theorem 3.8.
