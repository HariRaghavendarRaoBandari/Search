Abstract

In this study we introduce the notions of semi-homotopy of semi-continuous maps
and of semi-paths. We also construct a group structure, which will be called semi-
fundamental group, using semi-loops and explore some properties of semi-homotopy
and semi-fundamental groups.

Introduction

Homotopy theory studies topological objects up to homotopy equivalence. Homotopy
equivalence is a weaker relation than topological equivalence, i.e., homotopy classes of
spaces are larger than homeomorphism classes. Therefore, homotopy equivalence plays
a more important role than homeomorphism. Homotopy theory is a subdomain of topol-
ogy. Instead of considering the category of topological spaces and continuous maps, one
may prefer to consider as morphisms only the continuous maps up to homotopy. On the
other hand the concept of homotopy groups is a way to interpret topological problems to
algebraic problems which could be solve much easier. For this reason, homotopy groups,
especially fundamental groups, are very powerful tools for this purpose. To obtain further
insights on applications of homotopy groups, see for example the books of Brown [2] and of
Rotman [9].

The concept of semi-open set in topological spaces was introduced in 1963 by Levine [7].
He deﬁned a set A to be semi-open in a topological space if and only if A is between an open

subset and the closure of that open. Further, Levine investigated a notion of semi-continuity.
After the works of Levine on semi-open sets, various mathematician turned their attention
to the generalisations of various concepts of topology by considering semi-open sets instead
of open sets. New results are obtained in some occasions and in other occasions substantial
generalisations are exibited, by replacing open sets with semi-open sets

In 1971, S. Gene Crossley and S. K. Hildebrand [4] introduce semi-closed sets, semi-
interior, and semi-closure in a manner analogous to the corresponding concepts of closed
sets, interior, and closure. Further, a year later, they deﬁned that a property of topological
spaces is a semi-topological property if there is a semi-homeomorphism which preserves
that property [5]. Also, they shown that Hausdorff, separable, and connected properties of
topological spaces were semi-topological properties.

S.M.N. Maheshawari and R. Prasad [8] used semi-open sets to deﬁne and investigate

three new separation axiom called Semi-T0, Semi-T1 and Semi-T2.

Recently, P. Bhattacharyya and B.K. Lahiri [1] generalised the concept of closed sets to

semi-generalised closed sets with the help of semi-openness.

In the light of these works, the main purpose of this paper is to introduce the notions of
semi-homotopy and semi-fundamental group using the semi-open sets, to obtain different
group structures from topological spaces.

2 Preliminaries

The notion of semi-open sets in a topological space was introduced by Levine [7] as

follows.

Deﬁnition 2.1 [7] Let X be a topological space and A ⊆ X. A is called semi-open provided that
there exists an open set U such that U ⊆ A ⊆ U, where U denotes the closure of the set U in X.

Here is a concrete example of semi-open sets.

Example 2.2 Let τ = {X, ∅, {a}, {a, b}} be the topology on the set X = {a, b, c, d}. Therefore we
have semi-open subsets of X as follows:

SO(X) = {X, ∅, {a}, {a, c}, {a, d}, {a, b}, {a, b, c}, {a, c, d}, {a, b, d}}.

Following proposition is a well known result for semi-open sets. Hence we omit the

proof.

Proposition 2.3 [10, 7] Union of any collection of semi-open sets in a topological space is also semi-
open.

2

Example 2.4 Consider the space of the real numbers with the usual topology. It is easy to see that
intervals of the form (a, b), (a, b], [a, b) and [a, b] and their arbitrary unions are semi-open.

Proposition 2.5 Let X be a topological space and A ⊆ X. Then A is semi-open if and only if for
each point x in A there exist a semi-open subset Bx of X such that x ∈ Bx ⊆ A.

Proof: Let A be a semi-open set in X. Thus we can choose the set Bx as A for all x ∈ A.
Conversely assume that for each point x in A there exist a semi-open subset Bx of X such

that x ∈ Bx ⊆ A. Then

Bx = A

[

x∈A

and by Proposition 2.3 A is a semi-open subset of X.

(cid:4)
The notion of semi-closedness is introduced in [4]. Now we will recall the deﬁnition of

semi-closed sets and some-properties of semi-closed sets from [4].

Deﬁnition 2.6 [4] Let X be a topological space and C ⊆ X. C is called semi-closed if there exists
a closed set K such that K ◦ ⊆ C ⊆ K where K ◦ is the interior of K.

Example 2.7 Let τ = {X, ∅, {a}, {a, b}} be the topology on the set X = {a, b, c, d}. Therefore we
have semi-closed subsets of X as follows:

SC(X) = {X, ∅, {b}, {c}, {d}, {c, d}, {b, c}, {b, d}, {b, c, d}}.

Proposition 2.8 [4] In a topological space the complement of a semi-open set is semi-closed and
vice-versa.

Now we will recall the deﬁnitions of semi-continuities and some properties of them from

[10].

Deﬁnition 2.9 Let X and Y be two topological spaces, f : X → Y a function and p a point of X.
Then f is called

(i) so-1-continuous at p provided for each open set V containing f (p) in Y , there exists a semi-

open set A in X that contains p and f (A) ⊆ V ,

(ii) so-2-continuous at p provided for each semi-open set B containing f (p) in Y , there exists a

semi-open set A in X that contains p and f (A) ⊆ B, and

(iii) so-3-continuous at p provided for each semi-open set B containing f (p) in Y , there exists an

open set U in X that contains p and f (U) ⊆ B.

3

If f is so-i-continuous at every point of X for a ﬁxed i then f is called so-i-continuous.

Relations between so-i-continuous functions, constant functions and continuous func-

tions are given with the following ﬁgure.

This ﬁgure says that every constant map is so-3-continuous, every so-3-continuous func-
tion is both so-2-continuous and continuous, every so-2-continuous function and every con-
tinuous function is so-1-continuous.

Following proposition gives a criteria for so-i-continuous functions similar to one in clas-

sical topology. The proof is also similar, hence we omit.

Proposition 2.10 Let X and Y be topological spaces and f : X → Y a function. Then f is

(i) so-1-continuous iff for each open set V ⊆ Y , f −1(V ) is semi-open in X,

(ii) so-2-continuous iff for each semi-open set B ⊆ Y , f −1(B) is semi-open in X,

(iii) so-3-continuous iff for each semi-open set B ⊆ Y , f −1(B) is open in X.

This proposition could be given by using semi-closed sets as follows.

Proposition 2.11 Let X and Y be topological spaces and f : X → Y a function. Then f is

(i) so-1-continuous iff for each closed set K ⊆ Y , f −1(K) is semi-closed in X,

(ii) so-2-continuous iff for each semi-closed set M ⊆ Y , f −1(M) is semi-closed in X,

(iii) so-3-continuous iff for each semi-closed set M ⊆ Y , f −1(M) is closed in X.

so-1-continuous functions are called semi-continuous and so-2-continuous functions are
called irresolute [4]. In this paper the unit interval [0, 1] will be denoted by I, as a subspace
of reel numbers R with the usual topology.

Remark 2.12 Let X be a topological space. Then it is easy to see that the identity function 1X : X →
X is so-1-continuous and so-2-continuous but not so-3-continuous. Moreover usual composition of
so-2-continuous (resp. so-3-continuous) functions are again so-2-continuous (resp. so-3-continuous).
Thus we obtain the category s-Top of topological spaces with morphisms so-2-continuous (irreso-
lute) functions. On the other hand composition of so-1-continuous functions need not to be so-1-
continuous.

3 Semi-Homotopy

In this section we will introduce the notions of so-i-homotopy of so-i-continuous func-
tions, so-2-homotopy type, so-i-paths and so-i-homotopy of so-i-paths, and give some prop-
erties. From now on i will symbolize of a ﬁxed element of the set {1, 2, 3} for each item.

Deﬁnition 3.1 Let X and Y be two topological spaces and f, g : X → Y be two so-i-continuous
functions. If there exist a function H : X × I → Y such that for all t ∈ I the restrictions of H

Ht

: X −→ Y

x 7−→ Ht(x) = H(x, t)

are so-i-continuous with H0 = f and H1 = g, then we say that f and g are so-i-homotopic. In this
case H is called an so-i-homotopy from f to g and this will be denoted by H : f ≃i g or brieﬂy, by
f ≃i g.

Theorem 3.2 The relation being so-i-homotopic on the set of all so-i-continuous functions between
two topological spaces is an equivalence relation.

Proof: Let X and Y be two topological spaces and f, g, h : X → Y be so-i-continuous

functions.

Reﬂexivity: If f : X → Y deﬁne

H : X × I −→ Y

(x, t)

7−→ H(x, t) = f (x)

for all x ∈ X and all t ∈ I. It is clear that F : f ≃i f.

Symmetry: Assume that H : f ≃i g, so there is a function H : X × I → Y with H(x, 0) =

f (x) and H(x, 1) = g(x) for all x ∈ X. Deﬁne

G : X × I −→ Y

(x, t)

7−→ G(x, t) = H(x, 1 − t)

for all x ∈ X and all t ∈ I. Since H is so-i-continuous,

Gt(x) = G(x, t) = H(x, 1 − t)

is so-i-continuous, and G0 = g and G1 = f. Therefore G : g ≃i f.

5

Transitivity: Assume that F : f ≃i g and G : g ≃i h. Deﬁne

F (x, 2t),

H(x, t) = 
G(x, 2t − 1),


t ∈ [0, 1/2]

t ∈ [1/2, 1].

Therefore H : f ≃i h. Thus ≃i is an equivalence relation.

(cid:4)
Let X and Y be two topological spaces and f : X → Y be an so-i-continuous function.
Then the set of all so-i-continuous functions from X to Y which are so-i-homotopic to f is
called the equivalence class (so-i-homotopy class) of f and denoted by [f ]i.

[f ]i = {g | g : X → Y so-i-continuous, f ≃i g}

Similar to classical theory, using the new homotopy deﬁned above we will introduce the
notion of so-i-homotopy equivalence and so-i-homotopy type just for the case i = 2 since
the composition of so-2-continuous functions is again so-i-continuous.

Deﬁnition 3.3 Let X and Y be two topological spaces. An irresolute function f : X → Y is called
a irresolute homotopy equivalence if there exist an irresolute function g : Y → X such that
gf ≃2 1X and f g ≃2 1Y . If there is an irresolute homotopy equivalence between two topological
spaces then we say that these spaces have the same irresolute homotopy type.

Now we will give the deﬁnition of so-i-paths which is the special case of so-i-continuous

functions. Further we will give a more stronger version of so-i-homotopy for so-i-paths.

Deﬁnition 3.4 Let X be a topological space, α : I → X be an so-i-continuous function and α(0) =
a and α(1) = b . Then α is called an so-i-path from a to b in X. If a = b then α is called an
so-i-loop at a.

Deﬁnition 3.5 Let α, β : I → X be two so-i-path in X with α(1) = β(0). Then the function

(α ∗ β)(t) = 


α(2t),

t ∈ [0, 1/2]

β(2t − 1),

t ∈ [1/2, 1]

is an so-i-path and is called the composition of so-i-paths α and β in X. α ∗ β will be denoted by
αβ for short.

6

Deﬁnition 3.6 Let X be a topological space and α : I → X be an so-i-path in X. Then the function

α : I −→ X

deﬁned by α(t) = α(1 − t) is an so-i-path in X and is called the inverse of α.

Deﬁnition 3.7 Let X be a topological space and α, β : I → X be two so-i-paths where α(0) = β(0)
and α(1) = β(1). If there is an so-i-continuous function F : I × I → X such that

(i) for all t ∈ I the restrictions of F

Ft

:

I −→ Y
s 7−→ Ft(s) = F (s, t)

are so-i-continuous and

(ii) F (s, 0) = α(s), F (0, t) = a, F (s, 1) = β(s), and F (1, t) = b

then we say that F is so-i-homotopy of so-i-paths from α to β relative to endpoints and denoted
by F : α ≃i β rel Î. We will denote this by α ≃i β where no confusion arise.

Theorem 3.8 The relation being so-i-homotopic relative to endpoints on the set of all so-i-paths in a
topological space is an equivalence relation.

Proof: This can be proved by a similar way to the proof of Theorem 3.2.

(cid:4)

Deﬁnition 3.9 Let X be a topological space and α : I → X an so-i-path in X. Then the set

[α]i = {β | α ≃i β rel Î}

is called equivalence class (so-i-homotopy class) of α.

4 Semi-Fundamental groups

In this section, using the so-i-loops, we will construct a group structure on the set of all
so-i-homotopy classes of so-i-loops at a base point of a topological space. Following lemma
is a very useful tool to construct this group structure.

Lemma 4.1 Let X be a topological space, a, b ∈ X and α be an so-i-path from a to b. If there is an
so-i-continuous function ρ : [0, 1] → [0, 1] such that ρ(0) = 0 and ρ(1) = 1 then αρ ≃i α.

7

Proof: First of all note that αρ is an so-i-path from a to b. Now we deﬁne the so-i-

homotopy F : αρ ≃i α as follows:

F :

I × I −→ X
(s, t)

7−→ F (s, t) = α ((1 − t)s + tρ(s))

It is easy to see that F is an so-i-homotopy from αρ to α.

(cid:4)

Proposition 4.2 Let X be a topological space and α, β, α′, β ′ : I → X be so-i-paths such that α(0) =
α′(0), α(1) = α′(1) = β(0) = β ′(0) and β(1) = β ′(1). If α ≃i α′ and β ≃i β ′ then αβ ≃i α′β ′.

Proof: Let F and G be two so-i-homotopy from α to α′ and from β to β ′, respectively.

Then the function H : I × I −→ X deﬁned by

H(s, t) = 


F (2s, t),

s ∈ [0, 1/2]

G(2s − 1, t),

s ∈ [1/2, 1]

is so-i-continuous and deﬁnes an so-i-homotopy from αβ to α′β ′.

(cid:4)

Proposition 4.3 Let X be a topological space and α, β, γ : I → X be three so-i-paths with α(1) =
β(0) and β(1) = γ(0). Then

α(βγ) ≃i (αβ)γ.

Proof: By the Deﬁnition 3.5 compositions α(βγ) and (αβ)γ are deﬁned as follows:

and

α(βγ)(t) =

(αβ)γ(t) =

Now let deﬁne a function ρ : I → I by

α(2t),

t ∈ [0, 1/2]

β(4t − 2),

t ∈ [1/2, 3/4]

γ(4t − 3),

t ∈ [3/4, 1]

α(4t),

t ∈ [0, 1/4]

β(4t − 1),

t ∈ [1/4, 1/2]

γ(2t − 1),

t ∈ [1/2, 1].

One can see that ρ is an so-i-continuous function and ρ(0) = 0, ρ(1) = 1. Moreover (α(βγ))ρ =
(αβ)γ. Then by Lemma 4.1 α(βγ) ≃i (αβ)γ.
(cid:4)

Proposition 4.4 Let X be a topological space, x, y ∈ X and α : I → X be an so-i-path from x to y.
Then

1xα ≃i α ≃i α1y

where 1x and 1y are the constant maps at x and y, respectively.

Proof: First of all let deﬁne a function ρ : I → I by

ρ(t) = 


0,

t ∈ [0, 1/2]

2t − 1,

t ∈ [1/2, 1].

This function satisﬁes the conditions of Lemma 4.1 and 1xα = αρ. Hence 1xα ≃i α. Similarly
by taking ρ as

ρ(t) = 


2t,

t ∈ [0, 1/2]

1,

t ∈ [1/2, 1]

one can show that α ≃i α1y.

(cid:4)

Proposition 4.5 Let X be a topological space, x, y ∈ X and α : I → X be an so-i-path in X from x
to y. Then

αα ≃i 1x and αα ≃i 1y.

Proof: Let deﬁne a function F : I × I → X for all t ∈ I by

F (s, t) =

α(2s),

α(s),

s ∈ [0, t/2]

s ∈ [t/2, 1 − t/2]

α(2 − 2s),

s ∈ [1 − t/2, 1].




This function deﬁnes an so-i-homotopy from 1x to αα. Similarly, one can show that αα ≃i 1y.
(cid:4)

Theorem 4.6 Let X be a topological space and x ∈ X. Then the set

πi
1(X, x) = {[α]i | α : I → X so-i-loop at x}

9

of all so-i-homotopy classes of so-i-loops at x has a group structure with the operation

1(X, x) −→ πi

1(X, x)

([α]i, [β]i)

7−→ [α]i ∗ [β]i = [α ∗ β]i.

Proof: Proposition 4.2 shows that the operation ∗ is well deﬁned. By Proposition 4.3 the
operation is associative. The so-i-homotopy class of constant map 1x at x acts as the identity
element, i.e. for all [α]i ∈ πi

1(X, x)

[1x]i ∗ [α]i = [α]i ∗ [1x]i = [α]i

by Proposition 4.4. Finally according to Proposition 4.5 for all [α]i ∈ πi
[α]i up to the operation ∗ is [α]−1

i = [α]i ∈ πi

1(X, x).

1(X, x) the inverse of

This group will be called the so-i-fundamental group of X at x. In particular π1

1(X, x)
1(X, x) will be called irresolute fundamental

group.

Proposition 4.7 Let X be a topological space, x, y ∈ X and γ : I → X be an so-i-path from x to y.
Then

1(X, x) ∼= πi

5 Conclusion

It seems that according to these results one can deﬁne a more general notion semi-
fundamental groupoid following the way in [2] and [9]. Further, using the results of the
paper [3] of Császár it could be possible to develop more generic homotopy types and ho-
motopy groups. Hence parallel results of this paper could be obtained for generalized open
sets and for generalized continuity.
