ABSTRACT

For the collapsar scenario to be eﬀective in the production of Gamma Ray Bursts,
the infalling star’s angular momentum J(r) must be larger than the critical angu-
lar momentum needed to form an accretion disk around a blackhole (BH), namely
Jcrit = 2rgc for a Schwarzschild BH. By means of 3D SPH simulations, here we study
the collapse and accretion onto black holes of spherical rotating envelopes, whose an-
gular momentum distribution has transitions between supercritical (J > Jcrit) and
subcritical (J < Jcrit) values. Contrary to results obtained in previous 2D hydrody-
namical simulations, we ﬁnd that a substantial amount of subcritical material fed to
the accretion disk, lingers around long enough to contribute signiﬁcantly to the energy
loss rate. Increasing the amount of angular momentum in the subcritical material in-
creases the time spent at the accretion disk, and only when the bulk of this subcritical
material is accreted before it is replenished by a massive outermost supercritical shell,
the inner engine experiences a shutdown. Once the muﬄed accretion disk is provided
again with enough supercritical material, the shutdown will be over and a quiescent
time in the long GRB produced afterwards could be observed.

INTRODUCTION

The increasing observational evidence associating super-
novae (SNe) and long gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs) (see
reviews by Woosley & Bloom 2006; Hjorth & Bloom 2012),
supports scenarios like the magnetar (Metzger et al. 2011)
and the collapsar (Woosley 1993), in which the death of a
massive, rapidly rotating star is responsible for the forma-
tion of a lGRB. In the collapsar scenario, the energy for the
production of a lGRB is provided either by neutrino cooling
(Woosley 1993), by the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism
(Blandford & Znajek 1977), or a combination of both. The
formation and evolution of the accretion disk has been
studied in many hydrodynamical and MHD simulations of

to have an eﬀective neutrino cooling mechanism, the
infalling material’s angular momentum distribution Jr,
must be larger than the critical value Jcrit = 2rgc needed
to form an accretion disk around a Schwarzschild BH
(Lee & Ramirez-Ruiz 2006).

Further work has focused in studying the impor-
tance of the progenitor’s angular momentum distribution
in the energy production mechanism (Fujimoto et al.
2006;
2008;
Lopez-Camara et al.
2011).
Nevertheless, only 2D hydrodynamical
simulations by
(Lopez-Camara et al. 2009, 2010) have studied in detail the
eﬀect of transitions in the angular momentum distribution
between subcritical (J < Jcrit) and supercritical (J > Jcrit)
values. Such transitions in the angular momentum distribu-
tion have been obtained in SN and GRB progenitor models,
and are caused by convection at burning shells transporting
angular momentum outwards from the inner part of the
convection zone (Heger et al. 2000; Hirschi et al. 2004;
Woosley & Heger 2006). However,
if an eﬀective mixing
caused by magnetic torques and convection is present

during the evolution of the long GRB progenitor,
it is
possible that such transitions in the angular momentum
are suppressed (Perna & MacFadyen 2010). The results
from Lopez-Camara et al. (2010), show that in the scenario
where the transition in the angular momentum distribution
persists, the accretion disk formed from the collapse of su-
percritical material can in principle be completely destroyed
by the infall of a massive enough subcritical shell (& 3 times
more massive than the supercritical shell). This produces
a quiescent time where there is an ineﬃcient conversion of
potential to thermal energy in the quasi-radial accretion
ﬂow. However, the collapsar scenario is intrinsically a 3D
problem, where instabilities can easily appear and break
the axisymmetry assumed in 2D simulations. In a previous
paper (Batta & Lee 2014, hereafter BL14), we studied
this process and in particular considered the formation of
structure and gravitational instabilities within the infalling
envelope when it is entirely supercritical
in terms of its
angular momentum distribution.

Here, we now show the results of a new set of cal-
culations performed in 3D using Smoothed Particle Hy-
drodynamics (SPH) with the code GADGET-2 (Springel
2005), of the collapse of rotating polytropic envelopes onto
a BH. These simulations explore the importance of qual-
itative changes in the radial angular momentum distribu-
tion J(r), as has been explored in 2D collapsar models by
(Lopez-Camara et al. 2010). As we shall see, strong asym-
metries develop in the accretion ﬂow, leading to important
changes in the disk’s response to the collapse of subcritical
angular momentum material, and in the release of gravi-
tational energy, when compared to the 2D hydrodynamical
simulations.

This paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we de-
scribe the initial conditions and outline the input physics
included in our simulations, the results are presented and
brieﬂy discussed in section 3, and section 4 includes the anal-
ysis and conclusions from this work.

INITIAL CONDITIONS AND INPUT
PHYSICS

2.1 Envelope properties

in BL14, of
We constructed polytropic envelopes as
mass Menv = 2.5M⊙, extending up to a radius Rs =
1.715 × 108cm, and with a dynamical time scale tdyn =
s/GMs)1/2 = 0.0919 s, where Ms = 4.5M⊙ accounts for
(R3
the total mass of the system, which includes the 2M⊙ BH
ﬁxed at the center of the distribution (please refer to BL14
for further details).

The angular momentum given to the envelopes is
initially inspired by the GRB progenitors obtained by
Woosley & Heger (2006),
in
which J(r) shows drastic falls at diﬀerent radii (see top
panel from Fig. 1). Such angular momentum distribution
(blue line) has a supercritical innermost shell with mass
MhJa extending up to a radius rfall (leftmost gray region

in particular model 16TB,

at the top panel from Fig. 1), where the angular momen-
tum distribution of the envelope decreases drastically below
Jcrit (red line), resulting in a shell extending from rfall to
rlJ, with mass MlJ and subcritical angular momentum (red
shaded region). Moving outwards from rfall to rlJ, the angu-
lar momentum of the shell increases, up to the point where
it becomes supercritical at rlJ. This supercritical outer shell
of mass MhJb extends from rlJ to Rs (rightmost gray shaded
region in the top panel from Fig. 1).

In order to reproduce and parametrize the features ob-
served in the angular momentum of model 16TB, we as-
signed to all our envelopes a rigid body angular momentum
distribution J, determined by a piecewise constant angular
velocity Ω0 and the position on the envelope (r, φ, θ), such
that:

J(r, φ, θ) = J(r, θ) =(Ω0 r sin θ

f Ω0 r sin θ

for r < rfall
for r ≥ rfall

(1)

where, r is the distance to the origin, φ the azimuth angle
(playing no role on the rigid body rotation), θ is the polar
angle (where θ = 0, π/2 and π correspond to the north pole,
equator and south pole respectively) and f is a parameter
that will be used to produce a drop in the angular momen-
tum distribution at a radius rfall. We chose an angular ve-
locity of Ω0 = 5.67 rad/s with speciﬁc angular momentum
J/Jcrit & 1.1, to guarantee the formation of an accretion
disk from the collapse of the innermost material at r < rfall,
where the critical angular momentum is:

Jcrit(r) = 2 rgc = 4GM (r)/c,

(2)

assuming that the inner mass M (r) will eventually be ac-
creted by the BH. The angular momentum distribution ob-
tained for such angular velocity Ω0 can be seen in the left-
most bottom panel from Figure 1, showing the angular mo-
mentum J(ri, θi) given to a sample of the SPH particles in
the envelope. The red line showed in such panel corresponds
to the critical angular momentum (2), and each colored
point corresponds to an SPH particle located at (r, φ, θ). At
each radius r, as the location of the SPH particle departs
from the equator at θ = π/2, its angular momentum J(r, θ)
decreases from its maximum value. According to their ratio
J(r, θ)/Jcrit(r), each SPH particle is colored from red to blue
as J/Jcrit increases from 0 to 1. All particles with J/Jcrit > 1
(supercritical) are shown as dark blue points on top of the
red line deﬁned by Jcrit(r).

Once Ω0 was set, we deﬁned the subcritical radius rfall,
at which the original angular momentum distribution J(r, θ)
is scaled by a factor f , driving the angular momentum of all
material within rfall ≤ r ≤ rlJ to subcritical values. This
is shown on the middle and rightmost bottom panels from
Figure 1. For a given scaling factor f , the position of rfall
determines the mass of both the supercritical (at r < rfall)
and the subcritical (at rfall ≤ r ≤ rlJ) angular momentum
shells with masses MhJa and MlJ respectively, resulting in
increasing mass ratios MlJ/MhJa for smaller rfall. On the
other hand, the scale factor f determines the depth of the
fall in the angular momentum distribution at rfall, and more
importantly, it determines the position of the radius rlJ at
which J becomes supercritical again and the amount of su-
percritical material in the outermost shell MhJb. The intro-
duction of the supercritical radius rfall and the scaling factor

(blue line) and critical angular momentum Jcrit = 2rgc (red line)

gions have J > Jcrit and masses MhJa and MhJb respectively,
and the red shaded region starting at rfall has J < Jcrit and

ical angular momentum Jcrit and the SPH particles are colored

f , thus allows for a parametrization in terms of a varying
mass, and angular momentum content of the subcritical in-
falling shell.

Table 1 shows the values used for the radius rfall and
the scaling factor f in our simulations . As can be seen in
the table, the mass ratio MlJ/MhJa depends on both rfall
and f , as do the fractional masses of the supercritical shells
(MhJa/MhJtot and MhJb/MhJtot respectively) scaled by the
total mass on the supercritical shells MhJtot = MhJa +MhJb.
Simulations with a scale factor f = 0.75 have an outer super-
critical shell that roughly accounts for 50 − 75% of the total
supercritical mass, meanwhile in simulations with a scale
factor f = 0.5, it only accounts for ∼ 10% of the supercriti-
cal mass, providing little supercritical material to replenish
the accretion disk.

Due to the low angular momentum regime explored in
this work, most of the material in our simulations is accreted
quasi-radially in a few dynamical time scales, decreasing the
resolution given by the number of SPH particles. We ad-
dressed this issue by increasing the number of SPH particles
to NSPH = 2.7 × 106 in order to ensure that after the col-

2.2 Accretion and cooling

As in BL14, we made use of a Paczynski-Wiita (PW) poten-
tial for the BH (Paczynski & Wiita 1980) and deﬁned the
accretion radius racc as the position of the innermost stable
circular orbit (ISCO) for a Schwarzschild BH risco = 3rg =
6GMBH/c2. The BH mass increases as it accretes SPH par-
ticles, and thus rg and the accretion radius increase with
time, modifying the PW potential and increasing the crit-
ical angular momentum Jcrit needed to form an accretion
disk. In the scenario we are exploring, the accretion rates
are dominated by the accretion of subcritical material. This
would produce only a small increase in the BH’s spin param-
eter a = Jc/GM 2, that changes the location of risco from
3rg to rg/2 as a increases from 0 to 1. Therefore, as long
as a ≪ 1, as is our case, a non rotating BH and a rotating
Kerr BH would behave very similarly, and the dynamics of
infalling material should be the same.

For simplicity, we made use of the original EOS from the
code GADGET-2 which makes use of an ideal gas EOS, in
terms of an entropic function A(s) = P/ργ , where γ = 5/3
is the adiabatic index. We adopted the same cooling pre-
scription as in BL14, deﬁned by the internal energy u of the
material and a characteristic cooling time scale tc, consid-
ering this to originate from neutrino emission. We used a
single cooling time scale of tc = 0.12 s for our simulations,
which guarantees the production of enough energy to power
a GRB and is also able to induce the production of spiral
structure at the accretion disk (BL14). Since our cooling im-
plementation has a soft dependence on the internal energy
of the envelope (du/dt ∝ u), variations in the cooling rate Lc
will not be as drastic as the ones that should be obtained for
a more realistic neutrino cooling. Nevertheless, this cooling
gives the right order of magnitude for the neutrino luminos-
ity and will track intense variations in the accretion ﬂow as
shown in BL14.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Morphological features

As the innermost supercritical shell reaches its centrifu-
gal barrier around the BH, an accretion disk forms after
t ∼ 0.023 s. This dense and hot material accumulates near
the BH forming an outgoing shock that will slow down the
infall of material at larger radii. As this shock evolves, in-
tense asymmetries are formed (as shown in Figure 2), which
contain high internal energy, low density material with im-
portant amounts of subcritical material. This indicates that
they have formed, at least partly, from shocked low angular
momentum material that got close to the BH but was not ac-
creted. Figure 2 shows density cross sections at the XY plane
(left panels), and the angular momentum ratio J/Jcrit (right
panels) for SPH particles located in a disk of scale height
H = 0.12Rs. The snapshots on this ﬁgure correspond to the
simulation with the largest mass ratio (MlJ/MhJa = 5.247).
SPH particles with J/Jcrit < 0.75 and 0.75 ≤ J/Jcrit < 1
are colored yellow and red respectively, while particles with
1 ≤ J/Jcrit < 1.5 and J/Jcrit ≥ 1.5 are colored purple and
blue respectively. Since the mass of the BH and the infalling
envelope are comparable, we calculated the critical angular
momentum Jcrit(r) according to equation (2), considering
that all interior mass M (r) (BH, and SPH particles) con-
tributes to determine if material at a radius r has enough
angular momentum J to stay in a stable orbit around a BH
with mass M (r).

The snapshots shown on Figure 2 correspond to three
diﬀerent times: the beginning of the collapse of the subcriti-
cal shell, the end of the collapse of the subcritical shell, and
during the collapse of the outermost supercritical shell (top,
middle and bottom panels with t = 0.046, 0.092 and 0.138
s, respectively). As Figure 2 shows, the dense accretion disk
with ρ & 10ρs = 1.773 × 1010g cm−3 (blue to black colored
region on the density plots) is composed mostly of red and
purple colored particles, which correspond to barely subcrit-
ical material (1 > J/Jcrit > 0.75) and supercritical material
(J/Jcrit > 1) respectively. Both of these components are
distributed anisotropically throughout the accretion disk,
and the initial distribution is determined by a spiral pattern
formed from the outgoing shock. The supercritical mate-
rial distributed initially along this spiral pattern, gradually
mixes with the subcritical material as shown in the middle
right panel of Figure 2.

Besides the mixing between subcritical and supercriti-
cal material observed in the spiral structures at the accretion
disk’s plane, there is also an important mixing of supercrit-
ical and subcritical material going on at diﬀerent polar an-
gles. This can be seen in Figure 3 where we show the density
cross sections and the SPH particles ratio J/Jcrit along the
XZ plane. The densest part of the accretion disk (ρ & 10ρs)
is composed mostly by a combination of barely subcritical
and supercritical material with 1.5 > J/Jcrit > 0.75 (red and
purple colored respectively), with an important fraction of
the barely subcritical material located above and below the
accretion disk. This barely subcritical material surrounding
the dense accretion disk will be able to fall onto the BH,
without directly interacting with the supercritical material

at smaller latitudes. The degree of mixing observed between
subcritical and supercritical material at the accretion disk
is only possible in 3D, since previous 2D calculations do not
account for the possible mixing at the accretion disk’s plane.

This general morphological behavior was observed in
all of our simulations, even in the one with no subcritical
shell. However, by the end of the collapse of the polytropic
envelope, the simulations with scaling factor f = 0.5 had
lost about 70% of the supercritical material contained in
the innermost shell with mass MhJa, this will be addressed
in detail in the following sections.

3.2 Accretion ﬂow evolution

In order to study more qualitatively how the accretion disk is
aﬀected by the infall of low angular momentum material, we
followed the evolution of the mass contained in the accretion
disk, which has to be properly deﬁned from the properties of
the SPH particles. Material in a rotationally supported ac-
cretion disk, should complete several orbits around the BH,
before being accreted. However, if low angular momentum
material falls on top of such an accretion disk at a radius r,
it will reach the BH in a time tfall & r/vr , determined by its
radial velocity vr = ~v · ~r/r, and the distribution of material
at the accretion disk, preventing its direct collapse. Thus,
as long as this low angular momentum material is able to
spend enough time at the accretion disk before reaching the
BH, it will form part of the accretion disk and contribute
signiﬁcantly to the neutrino cooling process and production
of energy.

Material at the accretion disk will be accreted in a vis-
cous time scale tν ∼ R2/ν, determined by the disk’s radius
R and the viscosity ν = αcsH. The viscosity is deﬁned by
the α parameter (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), the local sound
speed cs and the disk’s height H. However, instead of imple-
menting an α viscosity in our simulations, we relied on the
intrinsic SPH artiﬁcial viscosity implemented in GADGET-
2 to mimic naturally occurring dissipative processes, which
can be accounted as a rough approximate to an α prescrip-
tion (Taylor & Miller 2012). However, the viscosity won’t be
determinant in the evolution of the accretion disk, since the
viscous time scale tν of our simulations (ranging between
6 − 11 s for a characteristic α = 0.01 − 0.02), is at least
an order of magnitude larger than the other relevant time
scales (tcool ∼ 0.1 s, tdyn ∼ 0.1 s and the total duration of
the simulations 4 tdyn).

To determine if material forms part of the accretion
disk we will compare the time it will take it to complete a
fraction of an orbit around the BH (torb = 2πǫ/Ω, where
Ω = vorb/rxy is the angular velocity around the rotation
axis), with the time it would take it to reach the BH with
its current radial velocity (tfall ∼ r/vr). If tfall > torb then
material will spend a signiﬁcant amount of time at the ac-
cretion disk before reaching the BH. With this deﬁnition of
accretion disk, material collapsing from large latitudes (close
to the poles) will mostly have vr > vorb and tfall < torb, and
won’t be considered as part of the accretion disk, mean-
while material close to the equator, will have vr < vorb and

to discard uncollapsed material with vr ∼ 0 and tfall > torb
as part of the accretion disk, we reduced the area of in-
terest where the accretion disk will reside, to a sphere of
radius rdisk = 0.5Rs which covers up to r ≃ 145rg for a
2M ⊙ Schwarzschild BH. This sphere of radius rdisk com-
pletely covers the region observed in Figures 2 and 3 and
guarantees that the outermost uncollapsed material will not
be accounted as part of the accretion disk.

same rfall = 0.55 Rs, using two diﬀerent values of the pa-
rameter ǫ = 1.0 and 0.5 (top and bottom panel respectively)
which determines the fraction of the orbit around the BH
that needs to be completed to form part of the accretion
disk. As can be seen, by increasing ǫ there will be fewer ma-
terial that will have large enough orbital velocity to complete
a fraction ǫ of the orbit, however, the qualitative features of
the evolution of the disk’s mass remains the same. The lines
in the ﬁgure are colored according to the average cylindrical

radius RlJ/racc ≡ [(P ri,xy)/NlJ]/racc of the NlJ subcritical

particles contained at the disk. This radius will indicate how
far from the BH the subcritical mass is concentrated. The
light grey shaded area roughly covers the time during which
the subcritical shell is collapsing on top of the sphere with
radius rdisk (from 0.05 s . t . 0.1 s), and the dark shaded
gray region covers the extended collapse observed in simu-
lations with f = 0.5 and a larger subcritical shell. Since the
value adopted for ǫ does not seem to alter the qualitative
evolution of Mdisk, we will use ǫ = 0.5 through the rest of
our analysis, which considers that a fraction of subcritical
material will form part of the accretion disk, as long as it
does not violently collapses towards the BH.

and 0.5 (top and bottom panels respectively) for two simulations
with the same subcritical radius rfall = 0.55Rs and diﬀerent scal-
ing factor f . The lines are colored according to the average ra-
dius RlJ/racc of the subcritical component, and all material at
RlJ/racc > 20 is assigned a blue color. The gray shaded region
indicates the times during which the subcritical shell collapses,

3.2.1 Mass within the accretion disk

The information provided by Figure 4 shows that for a given
subcritical radius rfall, the scale factor f changes dramati-
cally the evolution of Mdisk. In both simulations, material
becomes part of the accretion disk after t ≃ 0.02 s, and
before the collapse of the subcritical shell (grey shaded re-
gion), an important fraction of the mass of the accretion
disk is located near the BH (indicated by the red and orange
color of the lines), a region occupied mostly by subcritical
material (yellow and red colored particles shown in right
panels from Figures 2 and 3). During the collapse of the
subcritical shell, the average radius of subcritical material
RlJ/racc moves away from the BH, indicating that a signif-
icant amount of supercritical material is reaching the outer
parts of the disk. However, during the collapse of the sub-
critical shell, RlJ/racc gradually decreases, indicating that
subcritical material is moving towards the BH. Both of these
simulations have the same innermost supercritical shell with
mass MhJa extending to the subcritical radius rfall, followed
by the subcritical shell with mass MlJ whose mass and ex-
tension is determined by the scaling factor f . The simula-
tion with f = 0.5 has a more massive subcritical shell with
a mass ratio of MlJ/MhJa = 3.755 compared to the ratio
MlJ/MhJa = 2.215 for the simulation with f = 0.75. The
simulation with f = 0.5 also has a less massive outermost
supercritical shell that will replenish the accretion disk with

supercritical material, which can be observed in the smaller
Mdisk after the collapse of the subcritical shell.

The evolution of Mdisk for all simulations with a sub-
critical shell shown in Figure 5, gives important information
about the importance of the parameters rfall and f in deter-
mining the evolution of the accretion disk. All simulations
show a continuous increase in Mdisk until the collapse of the
subcritical shell begins. During the collapse of the subcriti-
cal shells (grey shaded area), all simulations either maintain
or increase Mdisk, and it is towards the end of the collapse of
the subcritical material where the more substantial changes
in Mdisk occur. Simulations with f = 0.75 end the collapse of
the subcritical shell before reaching the darkest grey shaded
region, at that point, the outermost supercritical shell with
mass MhJb will start replenishing the accretion disk. This is
shown as an steep increase in Mdisk starting before t ∼ 0.1
s for all simulations with f = 0.75. On the other hand, sim-
ulations with f = 0.5 show an intense decrease in Mdisk
once the subcritical shell has completely collapsed, which
should translate in an intense decrease in the disk’s energy
production.

Figure 5 shows that increasing the mass MhJa contained
in the innermost supercritical shell will translate into a more
massive accretion disk. However, this does not mean that
the subcritical material is not signiﬁcantly contributing to
Mdisk. This contribution can be seen in Figure 6, which
shows the disk’s mass Mdisk separated by its subcritical and
supercritical components (top and bottom panels respec-
tively) for four diﬀerent simulations. As can be seen, the

the supercritical components respectively, and the solid line cor-
responds to the sum of both components. Both dM/dt and Lc are
scaled to system units, which can be obtained from the system
properties.

amount of subcritical and supercritical material at the ac-
cretion disk is comparable throughout the collapse of the
subcritical shell. In Figure 6 the lines are colored accord-
ing to the average cylindrical radius of the subcritical com-
ponent RlJ/racc and the supercritical component RhJ/racc
respectively.

Clearly the scaling factor f is determining the most im-
portant features in the evolution of Mdisk and the accretion
ﬂow, since it regulates not only the amount of subcritical
mass that will fall onto the disk but also how far below is
the material’s angular momentum from the critical value
Jcrit. Decreasing the angular momentum of the subcritical
material will translate into a more violent collapse, which
could signiﬁcantly change the amount of time that subcriti-
cal material spends at the accretion disk. What is interesting
to notice is that all simulations, retained a large fraction of
the supercritical material during the collapse of the subcrit-
ical shell, which means that the previously formed accretion
disk was not dragged towards the BH by the subcritical shell,
even in the most extreme mass ratio MlJ/MhJa ∼ 5 in the
model with f = 0.75 and rfall = 0.52Rs.

3.2.2 Accretion and energy loss rates

The BH accretion rate can be written in terms of the deriva-
tives of the supercritical and subcritical angular momentum

MNRAS 000, 1–11 ()

mass components (dMhJ/dt and dMlJ/dt respectively) as:

dMBH/dt = −(dMhJ/dt + dMlJ/dt).

(3)

To compare the BH accretion rate and the supercritical
and subcritical accretion rates, we will treat the latter as
if they had opposite sign. Thus, a positive value for any of
them will imply that such component is transferring mass
to the BH and possibly to the other component. If there
is mass transfer between the low and high angular momen-
tum components, the one gaining mass will have a negative
accretion rate, while the other will have an accretion rate
dM/dt > dMBH/dt.

Figure 7 shows the accretion and the energy loss rates
(top and bottom panel respectively) for three simulations
with scale factors f = 1.0, 0.75 and 0.5 (black, red and blue
lines respectively). The solid lines represent the BH accre-
tion rate dMBH/dt and the energy loss rate Lc = du/dt. The
dashed and dotted lines stand for the contribution from the
subcritical and the supercritical components respectively.
All simulations with the same scaling factor f showed a
similar evolution for dM/dt and Lc and since the simula-
tions shown have similar mass ratio MlJ/MhJa ∼ 2, we can
conclude that the mass ratio between the supercritical and
subcritical shells is not the most important parameter deter-
mining the evolution of the accretion ﬂow. As we saw from
Figures 5, 6 and 7, the scaling factor is actually the main
driver of the properties of the accretion ﬂow, thus we will
analyze simulations with diﬀerent f separately.

3.2.3 Simulations with f = 0.75

These simulations are characterized by having a moder-
ate fall in the angular momentum distribution and a mas-
sive outermost shell with supercritical angular momentum,
which will replenish the initially formed accretion disk at
t & 0.1 s. They show episodes of negative dMhJ/dt dur-
ing the collapse of the subcritical shell, which could be
due to angular momentum transport induced by the spi-
ral structures observed in the ﬁrst two panels from ﬁgure
2 (0.046 s . t . 0.1 s). This episodes of negative dMhJ/dt
translate into small increases in the supercritical mass MhJ
shown on Figure 6, and they only appear during the collapse
of the subcritical shell, where the disk’s azimuthal asymme-
try is more noticeable.

In order to understand the evolution of the accretion
and energy loss rates shown in Figure 7 we must return
to Figure 6. In such ﬁgure, it is important to notice that
subcritical material is not immediately accreted by the BH
as it becomes part of the disk. Subcritical material starts to
build up at large radii, increasing the disk’s subcritical mass
component MlJ. This material slowly moves towards the BH,
reducing its average radius RlJ, and won’t be accreted until
reaching r = racc. Only when subcritical material reaches
an average radius RlJ . 7racc, a considerable fraction of it
will be close enough to the accretion radius to be rapidly
accreted in a quasi-radial fashion.

During the initial collapse of the spherical envelope,
subcritical material reaches the innermost part of the ac-
cretion disk before the supercritical material does. In con-
sequence, most of the supercritical material does not reach
its centrifugal barrier, and is located along with subcritical
material, safely away from the BH at the outer parts of the
accretion disk (as seen in Figures 2 and 3). Figure 6 shows
that the amount of subcritical material at the accretion disk
continues to increase far beyond the end of the collapse of
the subcritical shell, since the outermost supercritical shell
is still feeding the accretion disk with subcritical material
from above the equator. Before t ≃ 0.15 s, the subcritical
material becomes the dominant component of the accretion
disk, and its average radius RlJ approaches the accretion ra-
dius. It is when RlJ . 7racc that the amount of subcritical
material starts decreasing due to its rapid accretion onto the
BH. This rapid decrease in MlJ reduces the amount of hot
material contributing to the energy loss rate and is respon-
sible for the steep decrease in the energy loss rate Lc shown
on Figure 7 (red line) around t ≃ 0.125 s.

3.2.4 Simulations with f = 0.5

These simulations have a deeper drop in the angular mo-
mentum distribution at rfall, compared to simulations with
f = 0.75, which further reduces the angular momentum of
the subcritical material. They also have a small outermost
supercritical layer, which contains . 10% of the supercriti-
cal material of the infalling envelope. The later means that
there won’t be much supercritical material to replenish the
accretion disk after the collapse of the subcritical shell.

As subcritical material reaches the outer parts of the
accretion disk, it slowly moves towards the BH until reach-
ing an average radius RlJ ∼ 7racc at the end of the collapse
of the subcritical shell (dark shaded grey area on Figure 6).
Since the amount of angular momentum of this subcritical
material is considerably lower than the angular momentum
of subcritical material from simulations with f = 0.75, from
this point on, subcritical material gets rapidly accreted, pro-
ducing a violent decrease in the subcritical mass MlJ and the
total mass of the accretion disk (see Figure 5 and top panel
of Figure 6 at t ≃ 0.12 s).

The intense decrease in the accretion disk’s mass pro-
duced by the rapid accretion of subcritical material, can be
seen as the steep increase in dM/dt shown in Figure 7 around
t = 0.12 s, and it is also visible as the intense decrease in
the energy loss rate Lc reaching ∼ 1/3 of its original value
in ∼ 0.01 s. Since a signiﬁcant amount of subcritical mate-
rial was rapidly accreted, the value of the critical angular
momentum jcrit ∝ MBH, also increased very rapidly, reduc-
ing the amount of supercritical material. After this intense
accretion event, there is only very little material to replen-
ish the accretion disk, explaining the signiﬁcantly reduced
accretion and energy loss rates at later times.

simulations

by
The
Lopez-Camara et al. (2010),
found that the collapse of
subcritical shells with mass ratios MlJ/MhJa & 3 were able
to completely disrupt the accretion disk transforming the
accretion ﬂow into a quasi radial inﬂow with low neutrino
cooling eﬃciency. This result was obtained on both their
simulations with subcritical shells with J . Jcrit and J = 0.
In contrast, our 3D hydrodynamical simulations showed
that increasing the mass ratio did not necessarily translated
in the destruction of the accretion disk by the subcritical
shell, since the simulation with the largest mass ratio
MhJa/MlJ & 5.2 managed to endure the collapse of such a
massive subcritical shell. Instead, simulations with subcrit-
ical shells with less angular momentum support (smaller
scaling factor f ) were the ones that showed an overall
decrease in the accretion disk’s total and supercritical mass
(Mdisk and MhJ respectively).

The amount of angular momentum contained in the
subcritical shell, determined by f = 0.5 and 0.75, regulates
the evolution of MhJ during the collapse of the subcriti-
cal shell. In simulations with smaller scaling factor f , the
amount of supercritical material at the accretion disk MhJ
decreased, contrary to the slight increase observed for simu-
lations with f = 0.75. This increase in MhJ must come from
barely subcritical material (J . Jcrit) at the outer parts
of the accretion disk, obtaining angular momentum from in-
nermost material, by means of angular momentum transport
mediated by the non-axisymmetic instabilities observed in
Figure 2, or also from fresh supercritical material being fed

to the accretion disk region (r ≤ 0.5Rs) where MhJ was cal-
culated. However, to explain the decrease observed in MhJ
for simulations with f = 0.5 we have to consider the follow-
ing factors:

• There is very few barely subcritical material (J . Jcrit)
able to gain angular momentum and increase MhJ. Simula-
tions with f = 0.75 had mostly barely subcritical material
at the equator, which seems to have helped to increase and
maintain the amount of supercritical material during the
collapse of the subcritical shell.

• Since the BH is growing at a fast rate from accreting
extremely subcritical material, some of the initially super-
critical material will become subcritical due to the increase
in Jcrit. The growing BH mass increases the accretion ra-
dius, and the gravitational potential from the BH, reducing
the supercritical material’s circularization radius and thus,
its mean radius RhJ.

• Finally, it is possible that part of the decrease in MhJ
is due to the accretion of supercritical material by the BH,
but it is only likely to be important when the average radius
RhJ approaches ∼ 7 racc, which only happens by the end
of the collapse of the subcritical shell, thus, the fraction of
supercritical material that approached the accretion radius
racc should be small.

Results from Figures 5 and 6 show that a large fraction
of the supercritical material survived during most of the
collapse of the subcritical shell with mass MlJ. However, if
there is no ”fresh” supercritical material being supplied to
the accretion disk, the formerly supercritical material will
become subcritical as the BH’s mass and Jcrit increase from
the accretion of subcritical material. This eﬀect is visible
on Figure 6 for the simulations with f = 0.5, where MhJ
with average radius RhJ & 7racc reduces drastically after the
rapid accretion of subcritical material observed at t ≃ 0.12
s.

We should also notice that the amount of subcritical
material at the accretion disk and the time it takes for it
to be accreted, increases with the amount of supercritical
material contained in the innermost supercritical shell. This
supercritical material prevents the direct collapse of subcrit-
ical material, allowing it to contribute to the energy loss rate
before being accreted. This can be seen in Figure 6 where an
increasing mass ratio MlJ/MhJa (determined by a decrease
in rfall), turns into a small maximum mass MlJ at the ac-
cretion disk, and into an earlier decrease in MlJ after the
collapse of the subcritical shell.

4.2 Cooling eﬃciency and GRB production

As shown in Figure 7, the evolution of the accretion ﬂow
dM/dt and the energy cooling rate Lc = du/dt, was mostly
determined by the scale factor f used in the simulation.
This parameter is also critical in determining the cooling
eﬃciency of the system Lc/Lacc = Lc/[(dM/dt)c2], which
tells us how eﬃciently are we extracting energy from the
accretion ﬂow. Figure 8 shows the cooling eﬃciency Lc/Lacc
for all of our simulations. As expected, the simulation with

ratio MlJ/MhJa from Table 1 as indicated on the ﬁgure.

no subcritical shell is the one with the highest cooling eﬃ-
ciency (solid line), retaining a large amount of material close
to the BH and contributing to the energy production for a
long time. It is clear that the cooling eﬃciency is more sen-
sitive to the scale factor f than to the mass ratio MlJ/MhJa,
decreasing for smaller scale factors and increasing for smaller
mass ratios MlJ/MhJa.

Simulations with f = 0.5, i.e. with the smaller amount
of angular momentum, were the ones with the lowest cooling
eﬃciencies. The extremely low cooling eﬃciency of simula-
tions with f = 0.5 arises due to a rapid increase in the
accretion rate followed by a decrease in the energy loss rate
Lc (see Figure 7). Both caused by the rapid accretion of
subcritical material at t ≃ 0.12 s shown in the top panel of
Figure 6. As Figure 8 shows, by t & 0.15 s all simulations
with f 6= 1 have very similar cooling eﬃciencies. This means
that they have all reached a very similar ratio between the
accretion and the energy loss rates. Nevertheless, in simula-
tions with f = 0.5, the energy loss rate is considerably re-
duced by the end of the simulation, due to the small amount
of supercritical material that was supplied throughout the
collapse.

Figure 9 shows the evolution of the mean density ρav =

P ρi/Nin of the Nin SPH particles contained at the accre-

tion disk within 1 ≤ r/racc ≤ 18, for the simulations shown
in Figure 7. Simulations with f = 0.5 show a steep decrease
in the mean density ρav which coincides with the rapid ac-
cretion of subcritical material around t = 0.12 s. Since our
energy loss rate Lc is proportional to the internal energy
u, and the internal energy is also proportional to the den-
sity, the overall energy loss rate decreases accordingly with
the density, reaching the lowest values for simulations with
f = 0.5. This intense decrease in ρav would also decrease
the total power extractable from the rotation of the BH and
the accretion disk, since both the Blandford-Znajek mech-
anism, and the release of energy through magnetic torques
at the rotating accretion disk, depend on the strength of

10

the large scale magnetic ﬁeld B trapped in the vicinity
of the BH, determined by the density of the accretion
disk (Bisnovatyi-Kogan & Ruzmaikin 1974; Narayan et al.
2003).

Therefore, the question one should ask in order to know
if the infall of a subcritical shell will be able to shutdown the
inner engine is the following: Is the mass of the subcritical
shell large enough to increase Jcrit beyond the angular mo-
mentum of the innermost supercritical material? If it isn’t,
the accretion disk is very likely to survive the collapse of
the subcritical shell and still maintain a hot and dense disk
structure. However, if the subcritical shell is massive enough
to increase Jcrit beyond the innermost supercritical shell’s
angular momentum, the survival of a hot and dense accre-
tion disk depends on whether the outermost supercritical
shell replenishes the accretion disk before all subcritical ma-
terial gets accreted. Thus, in order to increase the chances
of the survival of a hot and dense accretion disk around the
BH after the collapse of a really massive subcritical shell,
the infalling envelope should meet the following conditions:

• The innermost supercritical shell should form a massive
accretion disk. Increasing the mass will help to delay the
accretion of subcritical material, allowing outer supercritical
material to reach the accretion disk before the bulk of the
subcritical material gets accreted.

• Have a subcritical shell with barely subcritical material
(0.75 < J/Jcrit < 1.0) feeding the accretion disk. Simula-
tions with such envelopes (f = 0.75) showed a longer lasting
accretion disk structure which allowed for the arrival of the
outermost supercritical shell before the subcritical material
at the accretion disk was completely accreted.

• A massive outer supercritical shell must feed the disk
before the bulk of the subcritical material contained at the
accretion disk is accreted by the BH. Otherwise the accretion
of subcritical material will increase Jcrit beyond the angular
momentum of material at the accretion disk.

This relatively simple criteria could be used to assess
whether a lGRB progenitor with an angular momentum dis-
tribution like the ones explored in this work, will be able to
show an inner engine shutdown due to the collapse of a sub-
critical shell on top of the accretion disk.

4.3 Final remarks

Our 3D hydrodynamical simulations with angular momen-
tum distributions parametrized by the mass ratio MlJ/MhJa
and the scale factor f , allowed us to study how the en-
ergy production is aﬀected by having subcritical angular
momentum material falling onto a collapsar accretion disk.
This is a plausible scenario observed in lGRB progenitors
(Woosley & Heger (2006)), however due to the narrow range
of parameters explored, one should take care when extrapo-
lating our results to diﬀerent progenitors. Here we summa-
rize the most important conclusions drawn from our results:

• The intrinsic 3D nature of the collapsar scenario and
the anisotropies developed during the collapse, prevents the

accretion disk from being dragged into the BH by the infall
of subcritical angular momentum material. The added de-
gree of freedom along azimuth in the orbital plane combines
with vertical motions (already allowed in 2D calculations)
to allow for greater mixing of high and low-angular momen-
tum material and distinct ﬂows in the equatorial plane which
greatly diminish the impact of infalling material onto a pre-
existing disk, and allow for its survival.

• The collapse of progenitors with transitions between su-
percritical and subcritical values in the angular momentum
distribution (as in Fig 1), can lead to the production of large
quiescent times originating from the absence of a hot accre-
tion structure near the BH. However, the formation of such
quiescent times is more diﬃcult than previously thought,
since it does not only depend on the mass ratio between
the infalling subcritical shell and the innermost supercrit-
ical shell MlJ/MhJa, but more importantly on the amount
of angular momentum contained in the subcritical material,
which determines if it will be accreted before fresh super-
critical material is supplied to the disk.

• The collapse of extremely subcritical material onto the
accretion disk will result in a shutdown of the inner engine
if the critical angular momentum Jcrit increases beyond the
angular momentum of material at the accretion disk, before
it is resupplied with an important amount of supercritical
material.
