This article reports an improved independent measurement of neutrino mixing angle θ13 at the Daya
Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment. Electron antineutrinos were identiﬁed by inverse β-decays with
the emitted neutron captured by hydrogen, yielding a data-set with principally distinct uncertainties
from that with neutrons captured by gadolinium. With the ﬁnal two of eight antineutrino detectors
installed, this study used 621 days of data including the previously reported 217-day data set
with six detectors. The dominant statistical uncertainty was reduced by 49%. Intensive studies of
the cosmogenic muon-induced 9Li and fast neutron backgrounds and the neutron-capture energy
selection eﬃciency, resulted in a reduction of the systematic uncertainty by 26%. The deﬁcit in the
detected number of antineutrinos at the far detectors relative to the expected number based on the
near detectors yielded sin22θ13 = 0.071 ± 0.011 in the three-neutrino-oscillation framework. The
combination of this result with the gadolinium-capture result is also reported.

INTRODUCTION

Precise measurements of neutrino mixing parameters
are crucial to searches for CP-symmetry violation among
neutral leptons and tests of neutrino oscillation theory.
In particular, the precision of neutrino mixing angle θ13 is
of key signiﬁcance in constraining the leptonic CP phase
δ [1–4]. Prior to 2012, many experimental eﬀorts had
been made to determine θ13 [5–10]. The ﬁrst measure-
ment of θ13 with a signiﬁcance greater than ﬁve stan-
dard deviations was reported by the Daya Bay Reactor
Neutrino Experiment in 2012 [11]. The most recent de-
terminations of θ13 from reactor and accelerator experi-
ments [12–16] are consistent.

The three reactor antineutrino experiments, Double
Chooz [17], RENO [18], and Daya Bay [19], currently
provide the most precise measurements of the mixing
angle. They use gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator to
identify electron antineutrinos through inverse β-decay
(IBD) reactions (νe + p → n + e+) with the neutron
capturing on gadolinium (nGd). A surrounding volume
of undoped liquid scintillator improves the eﬃciency of
detecting γ’s that escape from the doped volume, and
has been used (in conjunction with the doped volume)
by each of the three reactor experiments to determine
sin22θ13 independently through IBD reactions with the
neutron captured by hydrogen (nH) [20–22]. The Kam-
LAND experiment has used nH IBDs to measure the dis-
appearance of reactor νe [23] and the ﬂux of geo-νe [24].

The Super-Kamiokande experiment has used nH IBDs to
search for relic supernova νe [25]. Future projects, includ-
ing the medium-baseline reactor experiments JUNO [26]
and RENO-50 [27], and LENA [28], will also make use of
nH IBDs. Techniques developed for this analysis may be
useful for these future experiments.

The previous analysis of nH IBDs from Daya Bay [21]
is improved in this article with 3.6 times the number of
detected IBDs and with reduced uncertainties of back-
grounds and the neutron-capture energy selection eﬃ-
ciency. This statistically-independent measurement is
also largely systematically independent from the nGd-
IBD analysis, and improves the overall uncertainty of
sin22θ13 from Daya Bay.

This article is organized as follows. Section II describes
the Daya Bay experiment. The calculation of reactor an-
tineutrino ﬂux is described in Section III. Analysis of the
data, including event reconstruction and IBD selection,
is described in Section IV. Section V describes the acci-
dental background, and Section VI describes correlated
backgrounds. The IBD selection eﬃciency is discussed
in Section VII. The ﬁt for sin22θ13 and its combination
with the nGd-IBD result are presented in Section VIII.
Section IX brieﬂy discusses the impact of the results and
improvements expected in the future.

II. EXPERIMENT

Located in Guangdong province, China, the Daya Bay
experiment measures electron antineutrinos emitted from
three pairs of nuclear reactors, each reactor nominally
producing 2.9 GW of thermal power. Inside the adjacent
mountains, two near experimental halls (EH1 and EH2)
are located roughly 360-470 m from their nearest reactor,
and one f ar experimental hall (EH3) is located 1.52-
1.93 km from all six reactors.

Each far (near) experimental hall contains 4 (2) an-
tineutrino detectors (ADs) submerged in a two-zone wa-
ter Cherenkov detector [29]. An inner and outer zone
together provide each AD with > 2.5 m of shielding
against ambient radiation and spallation products of
nearby cosmogenic muons. These inner and outer wa-
ter shields (IWS and OWS) are independent cosmogenic
muon detectors with 160 (121) and 224 (167) 20-cm pho-
tomultiplier tubes (PMTs), respectively, in the far (near)
hall(s). Detecting muons enables estimates of muon-
induced backgrounds; particularly, 9Li/8He decay prod-
ucts and spallation neutrons.

The ADs were identically designed and consist of three
nested, coaxial cylindrical vessels: an inner and outer
acrylic vessel (IAV and OAV) [30] and an outermost
stainless steel vessel (SSV), as shown in Fig. 1. For future
reference, the z coordinate is deﬁned by the central axis
of the cylinders and the r coordinate is measured radi-
ally from the central axis. The IAV is about 3 m in both
height and diameter, and holds 20 tons of gadolinium-
doped (0.1% by mass) liquid scintillator (GdLS) [31].

3

The surrounding OAV is about 4 m in both height and
diameter, and holds 22 tons of undoped liquid scintilla-
tor (LS) to improve the eﬃciency of detecting γ’s that
escape from the GdLS. The surrounding SSV is about
5 m in both height and diameter, and holds 36 tons of
mineral oil (MO) to shield against radiation from the
PMTs and the SSV.
Each AD contains 192 20-cm PMTs arranged in 24
columns and 8 rings at a ﬁxed radius (r ≈ 2.19 m) in
the MO. Reﬂectors were installed above and below the
OAV to improve light collection. Three automated cali-
bration units (ACUs) are aﬃxed atop each AD and house
LEDs and various radioactive sources for calibrating the
energy scale and position reconstruction of events in the
ADs [32]. The ACUs deploy vertically at three radial po-
sitions: ACU-A at the center (r = 0), ACU-B near the
wall of the IAV (r = 1.35 m), and ACU-C near the wall
of the OAV (r = 1.77 m).

ADs were triggered, and recorded the time and charge
information of each PMT channel, when the number of
PMTs with pulses above threshold (NPMT) was ≥ 45
or when the integrated sum of PMT pulses from all
192 PMTs (Qsum) was (cid:38) 65 photoelectrons. Both trig-
ger thresholds corresponded to ≈0.4 MeV and accepted
100% of IBD positrons with > 0.7 MeV of deposited
energy [33]. Water shields triggered independently un-
der analogous conditions [29]. The trigger criteria were
tested within each cycle of an 80-MHz clock, and if satis-
ﬁed, the subsequent 1 µs (and preceding 200 ns) of data
from all channels were recorded. The physical interac-
tions that caused a single trigger in a given detector are
referred to as an “event”. The time of an event is deﬁned
as the time of the trigger.

More detailed descriptions of the detector hardware

are given in Ref. [34].

The analysis presented in this article determines
sin22θ13 by counting interactions of reactor antineutri-
nos in each AD in the one far and two near experimental
halls. Antineutrinos were identiﬁed in both the GdLS
and LS volumes via IBD reactions (νe + p → n + e+) in
which the positron carried away 99.4% of the kinetic en-
ergy of the ﬁnal state on average. The positron deposited
energy within O(1) ns and then annihilated with an elec-
tron, usually producing two back-to-back 0.511-MeV γ’s
(several percent of the positrons annihilated in ﬂight such
that the sum of γ energies was greater than 2 × 0.511
MeV). The neutron thermalized and was captured pri-
marily by Gd or H, releasing an approximately 8-MeV γ
cascade or a single 2.22-MeV γ, respectively. The time
from production to capture was typically tens to hun-
dreds of microseconds. The temporal coincidence of the
prompt positron and delayed neutron-capture clearly dis-
tinguishes antineutrinos from single-event backgrounds.

Pν(Ldr/E) is the neutrino survival probability, and
d2Nr(E, t)/dEdt is the number of antineutrinos emitted
from the r-th reactor at time t with energy E, which
is integrated over the periods of data acquisition for the

The baselines Ldr [35] were measured with negligible
uncertainty [34]. The cross-section σν was evaluated
according to Ref. [36] using physical parameters from
Ref. [37].
In the three-neutrino-oscillation framework,
the survival probability of electron (anti)neutrinos is ex-
pressed as

certainties were found to have negligible impact on the ﬁt
of sin22θ13 and its uncertainty. The reactor antineutrino

reactor Wth(t) and fraction of ﬁssions due to the i-th
isotope fi(t) were supplied by the nuclear power plant,
the average thermal energies released per ﬁssion ei were
from Ref. [38], the antineutrino yields per ﬁssion Si(E)
from 238U, and from 235U, 239Pu, and 241Pu, were from
Ref. [39] and Ref. [40], respectively. The correction to

The contribution from spent nuclear fuel Ssnf (E, t) was
estimated following Refs. [41, 42]. Combining the un-
certainties of these components gave a 0.9% reactor-
uncorrelated uncertainty of predicted IBD rate associ-
ated with a single reactor [43]. Additional information is

The data used in this analysis were recorded begin-
ning on December 24, 2011, with two ADs in EH1, one
in EH2, and three in EH3. Recording was paused on
July 28, 2012, to install the ﬁnal two ADs in EH2 and
EH3. On October 19, 2012, recording resumed with the
full-design conﬁguration of eight ADs. The ﬁrst measure-
ment with nH IBDs at Daya Bay [21] used the 217 days
of data recorded in the six-AD conﬁguration while this
study uses an additional 404 days of data recorded in
the full eight-AD conﬁguration until November 27, 2013.
Data acquisition maintained an operational eﬃciency of
> 97% with occasional pauses for maintenance. Exclud-
ing weekly calibrations, special calibrations, and prob-
lematic data, the data acquisition (DAQ) time TDAQ of
each AD is listed in Table II. With the nH selection cri-
teria described in the following sections, about 780000
IBDs were observed.

IV.1. Calibration and reconstruction

The

gain

converter

[analog-to-digital

chan-
nel/photoelectron] of each PMT channel was calibrated
in situ by ﬁtting the single photoelectron peak in
the PMT dark noise spectrum.
The peak was ﬁt
with a Poisson-Gaussian convolution [34]. This gain
calibration was validated by an independent method
using low-intensity LED pulses.
The energy scale
[MeV/photoelectron] of each AD was calibrated in situ
with muon-induced spallation neutrons that captured
on Gd throughout the GdLS volume. The two isotopes
157Gd and 155Gd, which release γ-cascades of 7.94 and
8.54 MeV, respectively, were ﬁt with two Crystal Ball
functions [45] as described in Ref. [33]. This energy scale
calibration was validated by an independent method
using weekly deployments of the 60Co γ source of ACU
A at the center of each AD.

The energy scale of an AD increased by 10-15% from
the center of the detector to the wall of the OAV, and
changed by 2-6% between the bottom and the top of the
OAV, depending on the radial position. Corrections of
energy scale as a function of position were applied with
two-dimensional maps (z vs. r) derived from spallation
neutron-captures on Gd in each AD. The maps were ex-
trapolated to the LS volume using spallation neutron-
captures on H throughout the GdLS and LS volumes.
The energy after correction is referred to as the “recon-
structed” energy Erec. The variation of Erec across an
AD was less than 1.0% for all ADs. The energy resolu-

tion was measured to be roughly 9%/(cid:112)Erec[MeV] at the

center of an AD. It improved by around 20% (relative)
from the center to the wall of the OAV.

A single position associated with each event in an AD
was “reconstructed” using charge-pattern templates de-
rived from Monte Carlo simulation [33]. From a sim-
ulation of positrons, the average distribution of charge
from the 192 PMT channels, or the charge-pattern, was
determined for each of 9600 voxels within the OAV, cor-
responding to 20, 20, and 24 divisions in r2, z, and φ
(where symmetry of φ was assumed to decrease statis-
tical uncertainty). For each event, a χ2 was calculated
for each voxel using the expected (from the templates)
and observed charges from each PMT channel. The voxel
with the smallest χ2 was selected and, with its nearest-
neighbor voxels, interpolated to obtain the reconstructed
position. The reconstructed positions of prompt events
(see Section IV.2) are shown in Figs. 2(e) and 2(f), where
a residual voxel grid is apparent. was about 12 cm in the
r-φ plane and 13 cm along the z axis, in the LS volume.
The position resolution improved by more than 40% from
the center of a detector to the wall of an OAV, and varied
within a few percent vertically. Using the 60Co γ sources
of the ACUs, the bias of the reconstruction was found to
be about four times smaller than the resolution, near the
wall of an OAV.

IV.2.

IBD Candidate Selection

IBD candidates were selected from pairs of succes-
sive events in an AD, excluding those within predeﬁned
time ranges of detected muons to suppress muon-induced
backgrounds. The IBD selection criteria for the nGd-
[12] and nH-IBD analyses are listed in Table I. First,
AD events caused by spontaneous light emission from
PMTs (PMT ﬂashes) were removed as described in Sec-
tion IV.2.1. Then, for the nH-IBD analysis, AD events
were required to have Erec > 1.5 MeV to exclude low-
energy backgrounds (see Section IV.2.2). The AD events
remaining after muon-event vetoes (see Section IV.2.3)
were grouped within a time window to identify double
coincidences (see Section IV.2.4). The resulting prompt
and delayed events were required to have Erec < 12 MeV
and Erec within three standard deviations of the ﬁtted
nH γ energy in each AD, respectively. Finally, the dis-
tance between the reconstructed positions of the prompt
and delayed events was required to be within 50 cm to
suppress uncorrelated double coincidences (accidentals),
which dominated the set of double coincidences (see Sec-
tion IV.2.5). The resulting number of nH-IBD candidates
(NDC) is listed in Table II for each AD. Details of the se-
lection criteria are described below.

requiring Ellipse ≡ (cid:112)Quadrant2 + (qmax/0.45)2 < 1,

where qmax is the largest fraction of an AD event’s to-
tal charge in a single PMT and Quadrant is deﬁned as
Q3/(Q2 + Q4) in which Qi is the total charge in AD az-
imuthal quadrant i and quadrant 1 is approximately cen-
tered on the PMT with qmax. The eﬃciency of this crite-
rion to select IBDs in the combined GdLS plus LS volume
was estimated with Monte Carlo simulation [44] to be >
99.99%. Flashes from six 5-cm calibration PMTs [34]
near the top and bottom reﬂectors were simply removed
by requiring the charge output from each 5-cm PMT to
be < 100 photoelectrons.

IV.2.2. Low-energy Criterion

AD events were required to have Erec > 1.5 MeV to
exclude events caused by correlated β-α decays from the
214Bi-214Po-210Pb and 212Bi-212Po-208Pb decay chains,
which originate from naturally-occurring 238U and 232Th,
respectively. Due to the greater quenching associated
with α’s, the 8.78-MeV α from the latter chain resulted in
an apparent energy of Erec = 1.26 MeV and the 7.68-MeV
α from the former chain resulted in Erec = 1.00 MeV. Ex-
cluding these decays reduced the uncertainty of the total
rate of accidentals by an order of magnitude. This crite-
rion rejected about 10% of IBD prompt events.

IV.2.3. Muon-event Vetoes

To suppress backgrounds from muon-induced spalla-
tion neutrons (Section VI.2) and long-lived spallation
products such as 9Li and 8He (Section VI.1), an AD event
was excluded from the analysis if it occurred within pre-
deﬁned veto time windows after cosmogenic muon events
identiﬁed by the water shields or ADs. Muon events from
the ADs, IWS, and OWS that occurred within the 2-µs

detector latency were grouped together for the account-
ing of all events associated with cosmogenic muons. The
muon event with the earliest time in the group deﬁned
the start of the muon-veto time window.

A muon event in a water shield, referred to as a µWS,
was deﬁned by requiring NPMT > 12 (15) in the IWS
(OWS). The muon-detection eﬃciency of these selections
was essentially 100% [29]. The higher threshold of the
OWS in the nH-IBD analysis (see Table I) removed cor-
related triggers that sometimes occurred O(100) µs after
an OWS event, due to electronics noise. These triggers
were handled in the nGd-IBD analysis by slightly modify-
ing the multiple-coincidence criteria (see Section IV.2.4)
to have no overlap with a muon-veto time window.

An AD event that was grouped with a µWS and with
20 MeV < Erec < 2.5 GeV was deﬁned as an AD muon
event µAD.
If instead, Erec > 2.5 GeV, the event was
deﬁned as a showering AD muon event µsh. The total
rate of muon events measured by each AD (Rµ) is listed
in Table II.

An AD event was excluded if it occurred within a veto
time window of 400 µs, 800 µs, or 1 s after a µWS, µAD,
or µsh, respectively. The fraction of DAQ time remaining
for IBD analysis after implementing these oﬄine muon-
vetoes is reported as εµ in Table II, with typical values of
79%, 83% and 98% in EH1, EH2, and EH3, respectively.

IV.2.4. Coincidence Time

dence windows were initiated 1 µs after an event to ensure
distinction of prompt and delayed events. Lone events
are denoted as “singles” and were used to construct ac-
cidental background samples (see Section V). Only pairs
of events, denoted as double coincidences (DCs), were
used to select IBD candidates. If more than two events
occurred within [1, 400] µs, they were excluded from fur-
ther analysis. In addition, if the ﬁrst, or prompt, event
of a DC occurred within [1, 400] µs of a preceding event
or muon-veto time window, the DC was excluded (this
requirement was also applied to singles). The fraction of
DAQ time remaining for IBD analysis after implement-
ing these multiple-coincidence criteria was about 98.4%
for each AD, and is reported as εm in Table II. This mul-
tiplicity selection eﬃciency was derived as described in
Ref. [46], and calculated using the duration of the coinci-
dence time window Tc = 399 µs and the rate of uncorre-
lated single events Rs (which are uncorrelated events that
satisfy the criteria of Sections IV.2.1-IV.2.3; not singles,
which exclude events involved in coincidences):

Correlated AD events were selected using a coincidence
time window of [1, 400] µs, which is about two times
longer than the mean capture time of an IBD neutron on
hydrogen in LS and about 14 times longer than that in
GdLS. Given the data recording window of 1 µs, coinci-

the detector); therefore, the spatial separation of the re-
constructed positions of the prompt and delayed events
dc was required to be within 50 cm. This rejected 98% of
the accidental coincidences at a loss of 25% of the IBDs.
Figure 2(a) shows the distribution of prompt energy
vs. delayed energy for all DCs in all near-hall ADs after
applying the coincidence-distance criterion. Bands for
both the 2.22-MeV nH and 8-MeV nGd delayed events
are apparent, with a large background of low-energy DCs
around the nH band. The clusters around 1.5 and 2.7
MeV are due to γ’s from 40K and 208Tl decays, respec-
tively. The bands between these clusters are dominated
by the decay products of 238U. The measured nH γ en-
ergy was around 2.33 MeV, which is oﬀset from the
true value of 2.22 MeV because of nonlinear detector re-
sponse and the calibration of the energy scale with nGd
events. The nH delayed events were ﬁt as described in
Section VII.3, providing a mean and a standard deviation
σ for each AD. Delayed events were required to have Erec
within 3σ (≈0.42 MeV) of the mean for each AD, which
excludes γ’s from 40K. The accidental background from
the remaining decays was eﬀectively removed by the sub-
traction described in Section V. Backgrounds from corre-
lated events are described in Section VI. Eﬃciencies and
uncertainties of the IBD selection criteria are described
in Section VII.

V. ACCIDENTAL BACKGROUND

the materials around and within the detectors. The en-
ergy spectra of this background are visible below 3 MeV
in Fig. 2(a). Because the delayed event of an nH IBD is
from a 2.22-MeV γ, which overlaps with this background
spectrum, the accidental background rate relative to the
IBD rate was typically > 50 times that of the nGd-IBD
analysis for the ADs in EH3 after applying all IBD selec-
tion criteria.

The background was estimated for each AD within
each run (about 2-3 days) by constructing accidental
background samples (ABSs) from the singles in a run.
An ABS was constructed by sequentially pairing singles
from the ﬁrst half of the run with singles from the second
half of the run. The resulting ABS consisted of NABS−tot
accidentals, and after applying the remaining IBD selec-
tion criteria (distance and energy), the ABS consisted
of NABS−cut accidentals. To obtain the true value for
εABS ≡ NABS−cut/NABS−tot, the calculation of εABS was
repeated for several hundred diﬀerent pairing sequences
of the singles, and the Gaussian mean of the resulting
distribution was taken as εABS. Figure 2(a) shows the
energy distribution of all DCs (621 days) of all near-
hall ADs without applying the delayed-energy criterion,
and Fig. 2(b) shows the energy distribution of the total
ABS (621 days) of all near-hall ADs after applying the
coincidence-distance criterion. Each ABS was scaled to a
calculated number of accidentals (NAcc) and subtracted
from its corresponding number of DCs (NDC) to obtain
the energy distribution of correlated DCs (NCor), which
are dominantly due to IBDs:

Accidental backgrounds were caused by two uncorre-
lated AD events that satisﬁed the IBD selection criteria,
and were almost entirely due to natural radioactivity in

≈ Rs · e−RsTc · RsTce−RsTc,

(7)

where Rs is the rate of uncorrelated single events and
εm is the multiplicity selection eﬃciency, both deﬁned
in Eq. (5). The approximation of Eq. (5) used in the
second line (εm ≈ e−RsTc · e−RsTc ) results from the con-
dition (Rs + Rµ)Tc (cid:28) 1 and is valid to within 0.1% for
Tc = 399 µs, Rs = 20 Hz, and the Rµ in Table II. This
approximation is not used in this analysis, but is shown
here to illustrate the basic components of the calcula-
tion: e−RsTc is the probability of no prior event within
Tc and RsTce−RsTc is the probability of a subsequent
event within Tc. NDC, NAcc, and NCor are listed for each
AD in Table II.

Figure 2(d) shows the energy distribution of NCor for
all near-hall ADs [Fig. 2(c) shows NCor for the far-hall
ADs], where the nH γ peak is cleanly isolated from the
accidental-dominated DCs shown in Fig. 2(a). The ef-
fectiveness of the subtraction is also illustrated in Fig. 3,
which shows the energy spectrum of the delayed events
after subtracting the accidental background for all near-
hall ADs and all far-hall ADs. Both the nH and nGd
peaks are very similar between the two groups of ADs.
Figures 2(e) and 2(f) show the reconstructed positions
of NCor prompt events after subtracting the accidental
background for all ADs in the far and near halls, re-
spectively. The positions are generally uniform through-
out the GdLS and LS volumes. The smaller concentra-
tion of events in the GdLS volume (r2 < 2.40 m2 and
|z| < 1.50 m) is due to the greater fraction of neutron-

8

captures on Gd.

The uncertainty of NCor is composed of the statistical
uncertainties of NDC and NABS−cut, and the systematic
uncertainty of RAcc, which is determined by the uncer-
tainty of Rs. The uncertainty from εm was negligible:
using Eq. (5) and Rs = 40 Hz, Rµ = 200 Hz, and
Tc = 399 µs (which are conditions similar to those in
EH1), dεm = 3× 10−6dRµ − 6× 10−3dRs. By taking the
average over a run, the induced systematic uncertainty
from variations in Rs or Rµ was negligible.

Rs was estimated as the average of an upper and lower
limit. The upper limit was derived from the total number
of AD events after applying muon-event vetoes. These
events were dominantly singles but included DCs and
multiple coincidences. The lower limit was derived from
the number of singles plus DCs that did not satisfy the
coincidence-distance criterion. These DCs were domi-
nantly accidentals. Time-averaged values of Rs are listed
in Table II for each AD. The diﬀerence between the two
limits was assigned as the systematic uncertainty of Rs
and propagated to RAcc, resulting in 0.18%, 0.16% and
0.05% uncertainties of the accidental rate in EH1, EH2,
and EH3, respectively. The larger uncertainties for the
near halls are due to the higher rates of IBD reactions
from reactor antineutrinos, which enlarged the upper lim-
its. Figure 4 shows Rs as a function of time for each AD,
where a downward trend began after the water shields
were ﬁlled. During the ﬁrst few weeks, Rs decreased by
< 0.05 Hz/day for near-hall ADs and by < 0.08 Hz/day
for far-hall ADs. The near-hall water shields were ﬁlled
earlier and so, the AD rates stabilized earlier. Consid-
ering that Rs was calculated every 2-3 days, the uncer-
tainty introduced to RAcc by these trends was estimated
to be < 2 × 10−5, which is more than an order of mag-
nitude smaller than the uncertainty in EH3. There were
also instantaneous increases of Rs, which were caused by

muon-generated spallation products such as 9Li and 8He
(Section VI.1), and spallation neutrons (Section VI.2).
From a study of Rs vs. time after muon-event vetoes,
the impact of these products was estimated to be negli-
gible.

Two methods were used to validate the subtraction of
the accidental background. The ﬁrst method used the
distribution of distance between the prompt and delayed
events, which was dominated by accidental coincidences
at large separations. After subtracting the accidental
background, the resulting number of correlated DCs with
large separations is expected to be zero. Figure 5 shows
the distribution of distance between the prompt and de-
layed events for DCs, accidentals, and correlated DCs.
The two upper panels of Fig. 5 contain calculations of
the relative diﬀerence between the measured number of
double coincidences (NDC) and the predicted number of
accidentals (NAcc), beyond 200 cm. These diﬀerences
are consistent with zero with respect to their statistical
uncertainties. A constant ﬁt in the bottom panel also
shows that the distribution of selected nH IBD candi-
dates (NCor) beyond 200 cm is consistent with an ex-
pected fraction of about 0.05%, which was determined

from Monte Carlo simulation. This fraction corresponds
to an expected ﬁtted constant of about 0 (3) entries/2 cm
for the far (near) hall(s).

The subtraction of the accidental background was also
validated by the distribution of time between prompt and
delayed events. Figure 6 shows the distribution of time
between prompt and delayed events for DCs, accidentals,
and correlated DCs. The two upper panels of Fig. 6 con-
tain calculations of the relative diﬀerence between the
measured number of double coincidences (NDC) and the
predicted number of accidentals (NAcc), beyond 1000 µs.
These diﬀerences are consistent with zero with respect to
their statistical uncertainties. A constant ﬁt in the bot-
tom panel also shows that the distribution of selected nH
IBD candidates (NCor) beyond 1000 µs is consistent with
an expected fraction of 0.7%, which was determined from
Monte Carlo simulation. This fraction corresponds to an
expected ﬁtted constant of about 16 (110) entries/10 µs
for the far (near) hall(s).

CORRELATED BACKGROUNDS

After the accidental background was subtracted to ob-
tain NCor, correlated backgrounds were subtracted to
obtain the number of measured nH IBDs (NIBD).
In
EH3 (EH1), NIBD/NCor = 99.2% (99.0%). Correlated
backgrounds consist of prompt and delayed events that
originate from a single source and satisfy the IBD se-
lection criteria. These backgrounds are primarily from
cosmogenic muon-induced 9Li/8He isotopes and spalla-
tion neutrons, and neutrons from 241Am-13C calibration
sources interacting with the SSV and its appendages.
The 13C(α,n)16O background is less signiﬁcant for the
nH-IBD analysis than for the nGd-IBD analysis and is
brieﬂy discussed.

VI.1.

9Li/8He Background

Cosmogenic muons and their spallation products inter-
act with the 12C in organic liquid scintillators, producing
neutrons and isotopes via hadronic or electromagnetic
processes. Among the muon-induced isotopes, 9Li and
8He β−-decay to neutron-unstable excited states, imme-
diately followed by the ejection of a neutron. These β−-
neutron decays mimic the prompt and delayed events of
IBD reactions. The lifetimes of 9Li and 8He (257.2 and
171.7 ms, respectively) are longer than the muon-veto
windows for a µWS or µAD (see Section IV.2), leading
to a contamination of the IBD candidate sample. The
temporal relation between 9Li/8He decays and prior de-
tected muons was used to estimate the collective yield of
the 9Li and 8He background NLi/He in each hall. The
distribution of the time between the prompt event of a
DC and its preceding muon was described by a formula
following Ref. [47]:

(cid:2)r · λLi · e−λLit + (1 − r) · λHe · e−λHet(cid:3)

N (t) = NLi/He

+ NBB · λBB · e−λBBt
+ NDCµ · Rµ · e−Rµt,

(8)
where λisotope ≡ Rµ + 1/τisotope and τisotope is the life-
time of the speciﬁc isotope (9Li or 8He), Rµ is the muon
rate (which depends on the muon selection criteria), r is
the fraction of 9Li decays among the 9Li and 8He decays,
λBB ≡ Rµ + 2/τB, and NBB and NDCµ are the num-
bers of 12B-12B coincidences and all other double coin-
cidences (excluding those from cosmogenically-produced
isotopes), respectively.

The fraction of 9Li r could not be reliably determined
because of the similar lifetimes of 9Li and 8He. Measure-
ments of 9Li and 8He yields from Ref. [48] indicate that r
should be between roughly 85% and 100% at Daya Bay.
Varying r in this range resulted in a 4% variation in the
ﬁtted value of NLi/He in all halls.

The beta-decaying isotope 12B was produced with a
yield about one order of magnitude greater than the
combined yield of 9Li and 8He. With its lifetime of

10
τB ≈ 29 ms, double coincidences of 12B-12B contributed
mainly within the ﬁrst ≈50 ms of the time since the pre-
ceding muon distribution. The ﬁtted value of NLi/He
changed by up to 10% when including and excluding the
12B term.

To obtain a better estimate of NLi/He, NDCµ was re-
duced by suppressing accidentals among the double co-
incidences. This was done by augmenting the prompt-
energy criterion from 1.5 < Ep < 12.0 MeV to 3.5 < Ep <
12.0 MeV. The measured number of 9Li/8He was cor-
rected with the eﬃciency of the augmented criterion with
respect to the nominal criterion. This ratio was deter-
mined to be 74% by averaging measurements from all
three halls with visible muon energy Evis
µ > 1 GeV (Evis
µ
is the detected energy that was deposited by a muon
traversing the detector). The weighted average of the
three measurements had a statistical uncertainty of 5%.
The systematic uncertainty was estimated as the diﬀer-
ence between the average and a Monte Carlo simulation,
and therefore accounted for backgrounds in the measure-
ments. The simulation used β spectra of 9Li/8He decays
calculated as those in Ref. [49]. The resulting prompt-
energy spectrum from the simulation is shown in Fig. 11,
where it has been normalized to NLi/He. The diﬀerence in
eﬃciency between the measurement and simulation was
6%, giving a total uncertainty of 8% for the eﬃciency of
the augmented Ep criterion.

The 9Li/8He background was determined for three
ranges of Evis
µ :
0.02-1.0 GeV, 1.0-2.5 GeV, and
> 2.5 GeV. The highest energy range was deﬁned as such
because it identically deﬁnes a µsh, which was vetoed for
1 s (see Table I) and therefore contributed only O(1)%
of the total 9Li/8He background. The lowest energy
range was deﬁned as such because it could not provide
a reliable ﬁt of 9Li/8He due to its higher Rµ and lower
signal-to-background ratio: relative to the middle energy
range, Rµ was 14 (11) times greater and NLi/He/NDCµ
was about 5 (10) times lower, in EH1 (EH3).

To obtain a more reliable estimate of the 9Li/8He back-
ground of the lowest energy range, Rµ was reduced and
the signal-to-background ratio was increased, by isolating
the muons that produced 9Li/8He. Under the assump-
tion that the isotopes were produced along with neu-
trons, every µAD without a subsequent neutron (deﬁned
as a 1.8-12 MeV event within 20-200 µs) was excluded.
The measured number of 9Li/8He was corrected with the
eﬃciency of this altered µAD deﬁnition with respect to
the nominal deﬁnition. Since this ratio could not be de-
termined for the lowest energy range, the ratio for the
middle energy range was used as a proxy. This ratio
was determined to be about 69% (66%) in the far (near)
hall(s). A 100% uncertainty was assigned to the back-
ground for the lowest energy range, corresponding to a
1σ lower bound of 35% (33%) for the eﬃciency of the
altered µAD deﬁnition in the far (near) hall(s).

The number of 9Li/8He for both the middle and low-
est energy ranges in EH1 and EH2 were determined with
the combined data samples of EH1 and EH2. The en-
ergy spectra of muons in EH1 and EH2 are similar [29]

such that their yields of 9Li/8He per muon are expected
to agree to O(1)% [50, 51]. The Evis
µ spectra of the two
near halls were observed to diﬀer in scale by about 7%.
This was due to a 7% lower average gain of the high-
charge range [52] of the EH2 electronics. After scaling
the Evis
µ spectrum of EH2 by 7%, the diﬀerence between
the near-hall spectra was O(1)% across the two energy
ranges. This scaling introduced a negligible uncertainty
to the ﬁtted number of 9Li/8He. The muon rate Rµ of the
combined ﬁt was ﬁxed to the DC-weighted average of the
measured muon rates in the two near halls. Combining
the uncertainties of the measured muon rates (0.3%) and
numbers of DCs (1%), the weighted average had a 0.2%
uncertainty. This 0.2% uncertainty of Rµ corresponded
to a 27% change in the number of 9Li/8He via Eq. (8)
for the middle energy range. The 0.2% uncertainty had
a negligible impact on the lowest energy range because
its muon rate was reduced as described above. The ﬁtted
number of 9Li/8He was divided among the near halls ac-
cording to their measured muon rates (after scaling EH2)
multiplied by their DAQ times.

Examples of ﬁts to the time since the preceding muon
without the 12B term for Evis
µ > 1.0 GeV are shown in
Fig. 7. The green areas represent the non-cosmogenic
DCs and the red areas represent the 9Li/8He DCs. For
presentation purposes, the plots use wider bins than the
actual ﬁts.

dividing the estimated NLi/He by TDAQεµεm and correct-
ing for the eﬃciencies of the altered deﬁnitions of the Ep
and µAD criteria.

Since the nH- and nGd-IBD analyses used diﬀerent
data samples, and the eﬃciencies were determined with
distinct methods, there was no correlation of the 9Li/8He
background determinations between the nH- and nGd-
IBD analyses.

VI.2. Fast-neutron Background

In addition to producing radioactive isotopes such as
9Li and 8He, cosmogenic muon interactions can gener-
ate energetic neutrons via spallation. Upon reaching an
AD, a neutron may scatter oﬀ a proton and then cap-
ture on hydrogen, creating a prompt-delayed coincidence.
Given the high eﬃciency with which µWS’s are detected,
the neutrons that contribute to this background predom-
inantly originate from the rock surrounding an OWS. Be-
cause the LS volume is more accessible than the GdLS
volume to the externally-produced neutrons, this back-
ground is signiﬁcantly higher than for the nGd-IBD anal-
ysis.

A Monte Carlo simulation of neutrons induced from
muons in the water shields was performed. An empiri-
cal parameterization for neutron production from cosmo-
genic muons [53] and the estimated average muon energy
in an experimental hall [29] were used to generate the ini-
tial kinetic energy and zenith angle distributions of the
neutrons. The resulting prompt-energy spectra of the
simulated neutrons are shown in Fig. 8. The increase of
events with decrease of energy in the LS volume is due to
the lesser containment of the recoil protons within the LS
volume: the protons that recoil from fast neutrons that
capture in the LS volume are closer to the boundary of
the scintillating region compared to those associated with

µ > 1.0 GeV.
The green area is the non-cosmogenic double-coincidence
component and the red area is the 9Li/8He component.

Uncertainties were from statistics, the 9Li fraction r,
the contribution of 12B, the augmented Ep selection cri-
terion, the altered µAD deﬁnition for the lowest energy
range, and binning eﬀects. The total uncertainty of the
9Li/8He background was determined from the combina-
tion of all components of uncertainty, and was dominated
by statistical uncertainty.

Table II lists the determined rate of background DCs
due to 9Li/8He in each hall. The rate was calculated by

are more likely to deposit less energy in scintillator.

To determine the fast neutron background spectrum,
a sample of spallation neutrons was obtained by slightly
modifying the nominal IBD selection criteria: the up-
per prompt-energy criterion was removed and the OWS
muon-event veto was excluded. Muons identiﬁed with the
IWS were still vetoed to avoid confusing a spallation neu-
tron with a muon event in an AD. In addition, the prompt
event was required to occur within 300 ns after an OWS-
identiﬁed muon and the delayed event at least 15 µs after
the muon to exclude muon decays. The OWS-identiﬁed
muon events were required to occur at least 1200 µs af-
ter any muon events in an AD or the IWS. The prompt
recoil-energy spectrum of the OWS-identiﬁed spallation
neutrons from EH1 is shown in Fig. 9. Figure 9 also
shows the prompt-energy distribution of IBD candidates
without the upper Ep criterion and the spectrum ob-
tained from the simulation. The OWS-identiﬁed and
simulated spectra were normalized to the IBD candidates
above 12 MeV, revealing consistent shapes.

Plotting the prompt recoil-energy spectrum in a log-log
scale (see the inset of Fig. 9) shows that the low-energy
portion of the spectrum up to several tens of MeV is con-
sistent with a power law [N (E) = N0E−a], while there
is a distinct energy-dependence at higher energies. The
entire spectrum could be ﬁt after adding one degree of
freedom to the power law; namely, extending the expo-
nent to have a ﬁrst-order dependence on energy:

spectra were normalized to the area of the extended IBD
spectrum. The green curve is the ﬁt of the extended IBD
spectrum using a ﬁrst-order power law (see the text). The
inset is a log-log scaling of the plot.

The ﬁt of Eq. (9) resulted in a χ2 per degree of freedom
close to 1 for each hall. Bin widths of 2 MeV were se-
lected for the near halls based on the stability of the ﬁt
parameters and the χ2 per degree of freedom. Due to the
lower statistics of EH3, the corresponding bin width was
3 MeV. The value of a was consistent among the three
halls, yielding an average of 0.690 ± 0.023. The value of
E0 averaged to (101.7 ± 2.1) MeV for the near halls and
was (110 ± 10) MeV for the far hall.

The fast neutron background and its uncertainty were
both estimated as in Ref. [12]. The background was
estimated as the number of events within the nominal
prompt-energy selection window (1.5 < Erec < 12 MeV)
in the normalized OWS-identiﬁed spectrum of each hall.
The spectrum was normalized to the extended IBD spec-
trum from all the ADs in a hall, between 12 and 300 MeV.
The systematic uncertainty was estimated using both the
OWS-identiﬁed and extended IBD spectra. First, the ex-
tended IBD spectrum of each hall was ﬁt between 12 and
300 MeV with the power law given in Eq. (9). Then, the
diﬀerence was taken between the integral of the func-
tion and the number of events in the normalized OWS-
identiﬁed spectrum, with Erec between 1.5 and 12 MeV.
The largest relative diﬀerence among the three halls (6%
in EH3) was assigned to be the systematic uncertainty
for each hall. In addition, each hall had a distinct ﬁt un-
certainty, which included the statistical uncertainty and
was about 6%, 7%, and 18% for EH1, EH2, and EH3,
respectively. The results are listed for each experimental
hall in Table II.

There was no signiﬁcant correlation between the nH-
and nGd-IBD fast neutron analyses because of their dif-
ferent selection criteria and independent event samples.

VI.3. Am-C Calibration Source Background

One of the calibration sources deployed from each of
the three ACUs atop an AD was an 241Am-13C neutron
source of approximately 0.7 Hz [54]. Neutrons from these
sources could inelastically scatter with the nuclei in the
surrounding steel (SSV, ACU enclosures, etc.) and then
capture on Fe, Cr, Ni, or Mn within the steel, producing
γ’s that could enter the scintillating regions and satisfy
the IBD selection criteria. During the pause to install the
ﬁnal two ADs in the summer of 2012, two of the three
Am-C sources were removed (from ACU-B and -C) from
each AD in EH3, reducing this background in EH3 by
about 40% relative to the previous analysis [21].

This background was estimated using a special Am-
C source [55] whose neutron emission rate was ap-
proximately 80 times higher than the Am-C calibration
sources. The special source was positioned on the top of
EH3-AD2 near ACU-B for about 10 days during the sum-
mer of 2012. Figure 10 shows the resulting distribution
of the reconstructed vertical position of delayed events,
which exhibits an excess at positive z (the top half of the
AD). For comparison, the distribution from the adjacent
EH3-AD1 (which had only an Am-C calibration source

background DCs, which is NAmC divided by TDAQεµεm,
for each AD. The prompt-energy spectrum of the Am-
C background was modeled with an exponential, which
was determined from both the simulation and the data
with the special Am-C source. The spectrum is shown in
Fig. 11.

For the nGd-IBD analysis, this background had a 45%
total uncertainty. Considering the common 40% system-
atic uncertainty, the Am-C background determination
was found to have a correlation coeﬃcient of about 0.7
between the nH- and nGd-IBD analyses:

40% · 40%
50% · 45%

= 0.7.

(11)

VI.4.

13C(α,n)16O Background

The 13C(α, n)16O background is from four dominant
the
sources of alpha decays in the liquid scintillator:
227Ac (in the GdLS), 238U, and 232Th decay chains and
210Po, which is produced in the decay of 222Rn. The
(α, n) background rate was roughly estimated using the
rates from the nGd-IBD analysis [12] and the ratio of
the nH/nGd IBD selection eﬃciencies. The estimate in
EH3 was approximately 0.02 ± 0.01 DCs per AD per day.
This estimate is expected to be conservative because of
the lower activity of the LS relative to the GdLS: using
the selection criteria outlined in Ref. [44], the concentra-
tion of 232Th was determined to be a few hundred times
greater in the GdLS while that of 238U was estimated
to be similar. The uncertainty of the 13C(α,n)16O back-
ground contributed negligibly to the total uncertainty of
sin22θ13 (see Table IV) and therefore, this background
was neglected in this analysis.

VI.5. Summary of Correlated Backgrounds

The rates of the correlated backgrounds are summa-
rized in Table II and their prompt-energy distributions
are illustrated in Fig. 11 for EH3. The rates of nH IBDs
after subtracting all the backgrounds are listed for each
AD in Table II.

With respect to the previous nH-IBD analysis [21],
the absolute uncertainty of the dominant 9Li/8He back-
ground was reduced by about 30% because of increased
statistics and various improvements in the method. Re-
ductions in the uncertainties of the fast neutron and
Am-C backgrounds resulted primarily from an improved
method of estimation and a ﬁt of the full spectrum, and
the removal of some Am-C sources, respectively. The
overall uncertainty of backgrounds was reduced by 30%.
Comparing to the nGd-IBD analysis, the fast neutron
background was about four to ﬁve times larger relative
to the IBD rate in EH3, while the 9Li/8He and 241Am-
13C backgrounds were equal within uncertainties, and the
13C(α,n)16O background was about half as large. The
absolute uncertainty of the fast neutron background was

in ACU-A) is shown over the same period, exhibiting no
apparent asymmetry. The distributions of the vertical
position of prompt events are similar.

The number of background DCs from the special Am-
C source NSpecial was estimated by subtracting NDC of
EH3-AD1 from NDC of EH3-AD2 during the same pe-
riod, resulting in NSpecial = 137 ± 41.6. The vertical
positions of both the prompt and delayed events were
required to be in the top half of each AD (zp > 0 and
zd > 0).

The intensity of the special Am-C source was scaled
to the intensities of the Am-C calibration sources of each
AD using “delayed-type” events, which are deﬁned as
singles that satisfy the delayed-energy criterion. The rel-
atively low energy of the nH γ selection admitted sig-
niﬁcant radioactive contamination into this sample of
events. To avoid this contamination, the higher-energy
nGd delayed-type events were used.
In Ref. [55], the
number of nGd delayed-type events due to an Am-C
source [NAmC−dtype]nGd was estimated by the asymme-
try of the vertical position distribution, which was similar
to that in Fig. 10. The number of background DCs from
each Am-C calibration source NAmC was estimated as

(10)

where NAmC−dtype is counted over the entire 621-day
data period. The nGd ratio in Eq. (10) was about 0.12
for the far hall and 0.23 for the near halls. The un-
certainty of NAmC was comprised of the 30% statistical
uncertainty of NSpecial and an approximate 40% system-
atic uncertainty shared with the nGd-IBD analysis from
a diﬀerence in delayed-type event rates among the near-
and far-hall ADs. This gives a total uncertainty of 50%
for the Am-C background. Table II lists the rate of Am-C

The muon-veto, multiplicity, and distance selection ef-
ﬁciencies were determined with data. The prompt- and
delayed-energy, and time selection eﬃciencies were deter-
mined with a simulation using a predicted antineutrino
spectrum such as described in Section III. The simulation
framework of Daya Bay is based on Geant4 [56] and has
been validated with comparisons to data [44].

In comparing the IBD rates among the far hall and
near halls, eﬃciencies and uncertainties common to all
the ADs are irrelevant. The AD-uncorrelated uncertain-
ties of the eﬃciencies, which reﬂect the identicalness of
the ADs, were determined by comparing data among all
eight ADs. The uncertainties of εµ and εm were negligible
(see Section IV.2). The remaining quantities in Eq. (12)
and their uncertainties, are discussed in this Section. The
contribution from IBDs in the MO is described in Sec-
tion VII.5.

VII.1. Prompt-Energy Selection

The ﬁrst selection criterion applied to AD events (af-
ter rejecting PMT ﬂashes) was Erec > 1.5 MeV. Ulti-
mately, this selection aﬀected only prompt events be-
cause of the more stringent requirement applied to de-
layed events. The prompt-energy selection eﬃciency and
its uncertainty were determined with simulation in which
the energy scale was aligned to that of the data (see Sec-
tion IV.1). The eﬃciency was deﬁned as the number of
IBD reactions N that satisﬁed the prompt-energy crite-
rion divided by the total number of IBD reactions:

εEp =

N (Ep > 1.5 MeV)

NIBD

.

(13)

The higher-energy requirement of Ep < 12 MeV was es-
timated to contribute negligibly to the ineﬃciency and
uncertainty, as suggested by Fig. 11. The eﬃciency in
the LS volume was lower than that in the GdLS volume
because a larger fraction of the annihilation γ’s deposited
energy outside the scintillating volumes. This fraction
was largest for IBDs occurring in the acrylic elements.
The net eﬃciency of all volumes was about 90%.

The AD-uncorrelated uncertainty of the eﬃciency was
estimated as the change in eﬃciency after shifting the
energy scale by 0.5%. The relative change in eﬃciency
was about 0.1%. The 0.5% shift is an estimate of the
AD-uncorrelated uncertainty of the energy scale that was
determined by comparing the ﬁtted means of the nH-IBD
γ and 212Bi α peaks of all eight ADs. For reference, the
estimated uncertainty of the energy scale in the GdLS
volume was 0.2% [12].

VII.1.1. Variation with Baseline

The L/E-dependence of neutrino oscillation [see
Eq. (3)] implies that the shape of the neutrino energy
spectrum changes with baseline L. Therefore, the eﬃ-
ciency of the prompt-energy criterion varies with base-

points) and estimated backgrounds, for the sum of all ADs
in EH3.

about four to ﬁve times larger relative to the IBD rate in
EH3, while the uncertainties of the 9Li/8He and 241Am-
13C backgrounds were similar, and the uncertainty of the
13C(α,n)16O background was about half that of the nGd-
IBD analysis. The impact of the uncertainties of the
background estimations on the uncertainty of sin22θ13 is
described at the end of Section VIII.2.

Due to the sharing of uncertainty components between
the nGd- and nH-IBD analyses, the Am-C background
determinations had a correlation coeﬃcient of about 0.7,
while the 9Li/8He and fast neutron background deter-
minations were uncorrelated, and the 13C(α,n)16O back-
ground was neglected in this analysis.

VII. DETECTION EFFICIENCY

The expected number of selected IBDs from one AD
was determined according to Eq. (1),
in which the
eﬃciency-weighted number of target protons was calcu-
lated considering antineutrino interactions in the GdLS,
LS, and acrylic volumes v:

where εµ and εm are the muon-veto and multiplicity se-

the coincidence-time and -distance selection eﬃciencies,
respectively. The PMT ﬂash selection eﬃciency (Sec-
tion IV.2.1) is not included due to its negligible ineﬃ-
ciency.

The number of target protons was determined for each
AD from measurements made prior to AD deployment.

reactor-detector pairs at Daya Bay was estimated by
applying oscillation to a predicted reactor antineutrino
spectrum as a function of baseline. At each baseline [35],
the IBD selection eﬃciency was determined with simula-
tion samples for the GdLS, LS, and acrylic volumes. The
simulation accounted for energy deposited outside the
scintillator volumes, and the nonlinearity [12], nonuni-
formity, and resolution of the detector energy-response.
The oscillation parameter values were the same as those
in Section III. The resulting variation in the IBD selec-
tion eﬃciency as a function of baseline is illustrated for
the LS region in Fig. 12. The shape of the curve is due
to the span of the data in the L/E domain. For the near
halls (smaller L), more oscillation occurred for lower en-
ergy antineutrinos, which decreased the number of IBD
reactions with prompt energy below threshold and thus,
increased the eﬃciency. For illustration, the mean energy
of a prompt event without oscillation was 3.626 MeV
while the corresponding energy in EH1 (EH2) due to
antineutrinos from the two (four) nearby reactors with
oscillation was 3.630 (3.632) MeV. These numbers are
representative of the ﬁrst 4 (8) points in Fig. 12. For the
far hall (larger L), more oscillation occurred at median
antineutrino energies and about equally at higher and
lower energies, resulting in a net decrease in eﬃciency.

In the ﬁt for sin22θ13 (Section VIII.2), the IBD selec-
tion eﬃciencies in the GdLS, LS, and acrylic volumes of
each AD were multiplied by a correction factor for each
reactor baseline (6 reactors × 8 ADs = 48 baselines) [35].
The ﬁt was ﬁrst performed without correction factors.
The resulting value of sin22θ13 was then used to gener-
ate a set of correction factors and then ﬁt again. This
iterative approach was tested using Asimov data sam-
ples generated according to Eq. (1) with known values of

region. The red circles denote the 48 reactor-detector pairs.

sin22θ13. Several values of sin22θ13 were tested and all
ﬁts converged consistently with negligible bias. No ad-
ditional uncertainty was assigned. Although several it-
erations were performed, the value of sin22θ13 converged
within the precision reported in this article after only
one iteration. The results of the ﬁts without corrections
were about 4% larger than the true values for the Asimov
data samples and the converged value for the measured
data. This variation of the IBD selection eﬃciency was
estimated to be an order of magnitude smaller for the
nGd-IBD analysis, which required Ep > 0.7 MeV.

VII.2. Coincidence-Time Selection

The eﬃciency of the coincidence-time selection was dif-
ferent for each detector volume v due to the diﬀerent den-
sities and neutron-capture cross-sections of the materials.
The eﬃciency was deﬁned as

εT =

N (1 < tc < 400 µs; Ep > 1.5 MeV)

N (Ep > 1.5 MeV)

,

(14)

and was determined with simulation. The eﬃciency in
the LS volume was about 85% and that in the GdLS vol-
ume was about 99% due to the shorter neutron-capture
time of nGd. These values were validated with data.

The neutron-capture time was studied in the GdLS
and LS volumes by ﬁtting for the mean neutron-capture
time with the following formulas:
NGd(t) = N0,Gd · [(1 + α) 1
NLS(t) = N0,LS · 1

e−t/τLS + C2,

τGd

e−t/τGd − α 1

e−t/τ0] + C1

τ0

τLS

(15)

where α balances two terms,
the ﬁrst correspond-
ing to the capture of a neutron at thermal energies
[O(0.025) eV] with time constant τGd, and the second
representing the diﬀerence in capture cross-section be-
tween thermal and IBD neutron energies [O(0.015) MeV],
with eﬀective time constant τ0. The capture-time spec-
trum in LS is due almost solely to nH which can be rep-
resented by a single exponential. This is because the
number of captures per volume per time, which is pro-
portional to the product of capture cross-section and neu-
tron velocity, is essentially independent of energy below
IBD neutron energies. For nGd, this product is much
larger at thermal energies than at IBD energies (see, e.g.
Ref. [57]), eﬀectively yielding two distinct time constants
with τ0 < τGd. The capture-time constant in LS is de-
noted by τLS, and C1 and C2 account for accidentals.

The neutron-capture times for the GdLS and LS re-
gions were studied using nGd- and nH-IBDs, respec-
tively. The selection criteria were slightly modiﬁed from
the nominal IBD criteria: the nGd delayed events were
selected between 6 and 10 MeV, while the nH prompt-
energy lower limit was increased to 3.5 MeV to minimize
the accidental background, and the nH delayed-energy
criterion was ﬁxed to 1.8-2.8 MeV. When ﬁtting the nGd-
IBD spectrum, the reconstructed positions of the prompt

minimize the fraction of neutrons that originated from, or
had any interactions, outside GdLS. Similarly, when ﬁt-
ting the nH-IBD spectrum, a constraint of r > 1.7 m was
applied to minimize the fraction of neutrons that origi-
nated from GdLS. The ﬁt results using the data from all
ADs are shown in Figs. 13 and 14. Good agreement is
observed between the data and simulation. The ﬁtted
capture-time constants were about 28.1 and 216 µs for
the GdLS and LS volumes, respectively. For reference,
Fig. 6 shows the total capture-time spectra of the far- and
near-hall ADs for the nominal nH-IBD selection criteria
before and after subtracting the accidental background.
The AD-uncorrelated uncertainty of the 400 µs crite-

16

rion in the combined GdLS and LS volume was partly
estimated using β-α events from the 214Bi-214Po-210Pb
decay chain. These events provided greater statistics
than nH events and were used to determine the varia-
tion of the time measurements of the electronics. The
lifetime of 214Po is 237 µs, which is close to the mean
nH capture time in LS. The eﬃciency of the selection
was determined relative to the number of double coinci-
dences with a coincidence time window of [1, 1500] µs.
The relative diﬀerences of the eﬃciencies of all eight ADs
are shown in Fig. 15, and are within 0.1% at the selection
criterion of 400 µs.

Similarly, the uncertainty associated with the 1 µs cri-
terion was determined to be 0.1% by comparing the rel-
ative number of events between 1 and 2 µs.

Because the estimates of the uncertainties were per-
formed using a source diﬀerent from neutrons, addi-
tional uncertainties related to neutron-capture time were
added. The uncertainties considered were identiﬁed from
an expression of the mean neutron-capture time:

where vn is the velocity of the neutron, λ is the mean

topes other than Gd and H contributed less than 1%

For the LS vol-
ume, the measured density diﬀered by < 0.1% among the
ADs. In addition, the ﬂuctuation in density caused by
temperature changes uncorrelated among experimental
halls was within 0.045% during the data-recording pe-
riod. These eﬀects introduced a < 0.11% uncertainty to
the neutron-capture time τ . This uncertainty was prop-
agated through Eq. (15) to obtain an approximate 0.02%
AD-uncorrelated uncertainty.

The uncertainties from the 214Bi β-α event compar-
isons and neutron-capture time-related quantities were
combined to give a total AD-uncorrelated uncertainty of
0.14% for the eﬃciency of the coincidence-time criterion.

VII.3. Delayed-Energy Selection

The eﬃciency of the delayed-energy selection was de-

termined with simulation and deﬁned as

εEd =

N (Ed ± 3σ; 1 < tc < 400 µs; Ep > 1.5 MeV)

N (1 < tc < 400 µs; Ep > 1.5 MeV)

.

(17)
This deﬁnition does not preclude IBDs with the neutron
captured by nuclei other than hydrogen; for example,
nGd IBDs comprised approximately 0.7% of the IBDs
after applying the delayed-energy criterion. For both
simulation and data, the µ ± 3σ selection was applied
using the mean µ and standard deviation σ from a ﬁt of
the delayed-energy spectrum with the Crystal Ball func-
tion [45]. The selection eﬃciency in the GdLS volume
was about 15% primarily because of neutron-capture by
gadolinium. The eﬃciency in the LS volume was about
65% primarily because of the outward escape of the nH
γ’s.

Two methods were used to estimate

the AD-
uncorrelated uncertainty of the delayed-energy selection
eﬃciency. One method is a relative comparison of the
delayed-energy spectra of the ADs. The comparison was
made after applying all the nH selection criteria and sub-
tracting the accidental backgrounds (errors from acciden-
tal subtractions were included in the energy spectra).
The method uses the number of events within two en-
ergy ranges: the ﬁrst is the nominal selection of µ ± 3σ,
which is approximately [1.90, 2.74] MeV, and the sec-
ond is [1.50, 2.80] MeV. These two ranges are visible
for each AD in Fig. 16. The upper value of the latter
range was chosen to include most of the nH IBDs with
Ed > 2.74 MeV (0.1% of nH IBDs) while the lower value
corresponds to the low-energy criterion (Section IV.2.2)
and includes more of the tail of the spectrum (12% more
nH IBDs). The latter range contains both peak and tail
portions of the spectrum and therefore is assumed to be
sensitive to all factors that might inﬂuence the shape of
the spectrum.

For each AD i, the number of events in the nominal
range A (NA,i) was plotted vs. the number of events in
the extended range B (NB,i) and a linear relation was

pairs of vertical lines correspond to the largest and smallest
3σ selections.

ﬁt:

N A(NB,i) = a + bNB,i.

(18)

This line represents the average behavior of all ADs,
including diﬀerences in their spectral shape and back-
grounds. Here, the eﬃciency of the delayed-energy selec-
tion ε is deﬁned as NA/NTotal, where NTotal is the num-
ber of events without the delayed-energy selection. The
ﬁtted line was used to determine the relative variation of
ε for each AD:

(19)

This determination assumes that there is no variation in
NTotal. From studies with simulation, it was found that
NA and NTotal are highly correlated under various scenar-
ios that could modify the shape of the spectrum, includ-
ing diﬀerences in OAV dimensions [34] and the residual
nonuniformity of Erec, making this assumption conserva-
tive. This determination also assumes that variations in
the spectrum outside range B are not systematically dif-
ferent from those within. Using simulation, diﬀerences in
OAV dimensions or in the mean free path of the γ’s were
found to have a greater impact on the shape of the spec-
trum at the low-energy end, but to contribute negligibly
to δεi/εi. In addition, comparing the high-statistics spec-
tra of the near-hall ADs did not reveal any systematic
trends in the diﬀerences among spectra above 1.5 MeV,
suggesting that there may not be any such trends be-
low 1.5 MeV. The statistical uncertainties of the data
from the far-hall ADs were large, so they were excluded
from the determination though they were conservatively
used in the linear ﬁt. Comparing the four near-hall ADs,
the half-range of the δεi/εi was 0.33%. This estimation

tion, energy scale, and factors that may inﬂuence the
shape of the spectrum; however, it does not include vari-
ations in the fraction of neutrons that capture on hydro-
gen (53%) relative to other isotopes, such as Gd (46%)
and C (0.5%), because such variations have an equivalent
impact on NB and NA.

The fraction of neutrons that capture on isotope x is
expressed similarly as the mean capture time in Eq. (16):

(cid:80)

.

(20)

fx =

nxσx(vn)
i niσi(vn)

Performing error propagation on Eq. (16) and Eq. (20),
and combining the results, the variation of fx among the
ADs was expressed in terms of the variation of τ and
one of the ni. In this way, the variation of the measured
capture time in the GdLS was used to constrain the vari-
ation of nGd. The variation of nH was taken to be neg-
ligible because of the mixing of all production batches
of scintillator [31] and the ﬁlling procedures applied to
the ADs [58]. As a result, the AD-to-AD variation of the
fraction of nH captures was estimated to be < 0.01% and
0.16% in the LS and GdLS volumes, respectively. These
two values correspond to approximately 0.03% for the
full volume.

Combining the variations estimated from the spec-
tral comparison and the nH capture-fraction calculation
yields a total AD-uncorrelated uncertainty of 0.33% for
the delayed-energy selection eﬃciency.

The second method used to evaluate the uncertainty of
the delayed-energy selection eﬃciency is the ratio of the
numbers of spallation nH to spallation nGd (NnH/NnGd),
which utilizes the smaller variation of the nGd delayed-
energy selection eﬃciency and the larger sample of spal-
lation neutrons. The energy spectrum of spallation-nH
and -nGd γ’s from each AD was obtained by subtracting
a background spectrum recorded in a background time
window from the spectrum recorded in a signal time
window. Spallation neutrons generated by cosmogenic
muons were identiﬁed as delayed-type events that fol-
lowed WS- or AD-identiﬁed muons. These muons were
identiﬁed with greater purity by augmenting the deﬁni-
tions of a µWS and µAD: for both the IWS and OWS,
NPMT was required to be > 20, and a µAD was required
to have Erec > 50 MeV. A 20-µs muon-event veto-time
was applied to avoid the “ringing” of PMT signals that
followed high-energy events [59]. The signal time window
was between 20 and 700 µs after a muon event. The back-
ground time window was a similar length, however, given
the diﬀerent distributions of muon energy and trajectory
among halls [29] (which aﬀected the characteristics of the
spallation products), the background window was tuned
to be slightly diﬀerent in each hall. By matching both
the shape and population of the tail portions of the signal
and background energy spectra, the background window
was set to be between 700 and 1480, 1453, and 1384 µs,
in EH1, EH2, and EH3, respectively. Both nGd and nH
delayed-energy criteria were nominal (see Table I).

The energy spectra of the spallation-neutron-capture

18

γ’s were ﬁtted with signal and background components.
The background component accounted for residual spal-
lation products that were not subtracted with the back-
ground window. For the nH spectrum, the signal com-
ponent was a Crystal Ball function and the background
function was a second-order polynomial. For nGd, the
signal component was two Crystal Ball functions as men-
tioned in Section IV.1, and the background function was
a ﬁrst-order polynomial. Fit results are shown in Figs. 17
and 18, where the number of signal events deﬁned as spal-
lation neutrons are labeled as “Nsig”.

Compared with the previous analysis [21], the spalla-
tion neutron ratio is updated in this article by normal-
izing the number of neutrons to the number of target

where rε is the ratio of eﬃciencies of selecting spalla-
tion nH in GdLS vs. LS: rε ≡ εGdLS/εLS. Due to the
non-uniform distribution of spallation neutrons, rε is not
precisely known; therefore, two extreme cases were con-
sidered: a) the distribution is entirely within the LS
(rε = 0); b) the distribution is uniform (rε = 0.22 from
simulated IBDs). Figure 19 shows the diﬀerence in the
ratio deﬁned by Eq. (21) for each near-hall AD relative
to the mean of the four ADs. The far-hall ADs were not
used due to their lack of statistics. The choice of rε is
found to have little impact on the variation of the ratio.
The half-range of the ratios of the near-hall ADs is ap-
proximately 0.35%. Due to the use of a ratio with nGd
events, this estimation inherently includes the variation
of the nGd delayed-energy criterion, which was estimated
to be 0.12% for IBDs [49]. This estimate also inherently
includes the variation of the fraction of neutrons that
capture on hydrogen.

FIG. 19. Diﬀerence in the ratio of the number of spallation-
nH/-nGd events in the ﬁtted energy peaks of each near-hall
AD relative to the mean of all near-hall ADs. See the text for
details.

Given the 0.33% and 0.35% relative uncertainties from
the two independent methods, 0.35% was assigned for the
total AD-uncorrelated uncertainty of the delayed-energy
selection eﬃciency.

To determine the correlation of the delayed-energy se-
lection eﬃciency between the nH and nGd analyses, the
uncertainty was decomposed into three components: 3σ
variation, energy scale variation, and others. The con-
tributions of the ﬁrst two components were estimated
with simulation by applying the largest and smallest 3σ
ranges (see Fig. 16) and shifting the energy scale (see
Section VII.1), respectively. The ﬁrst component, which
was dominant, does not exist for the nGd-IBD analy-
sis and thus, is uncorrelated. The correlation of energy
scale variations between the nH- and nGd-IBD analyses
was estimated to be 0.8 with a linear ﬁt of the measured

19

nH-IBD vs. nGd-IBD delayed-energy peaks. The latter
component of “others” accounts for any contributions not
directly evaluated, such as diﬀerences in OAV dimensions
or the residual nonuniformity of Erec, and was assumed
to be fully correlated. The hydrogen capture fractions
of the nH analysis were determined to be anticorrelated
with the gadolinium capture fraction of the nGd analy-
sis:
in the GdLS volume, if the fraction of captures on
Gd increases, then naturally the fraction on H decreases.
In the LS volume, the same anticorrelated relation ex-
ists via neutrons that are produced in GdLS or LS but
capture in the other of the two volumes. Combining the
correlation constants and corresponding component un-
certainties from both the nH and nGd analyses yields an
overall correlation coeﬃcient of 0.07 for the eﬃciency of
the delayed-energy selection.

VII.4. Coincidence-Distance Selection

The eﬃciency of the coincidence-distance selection was

measured with data and deﬁned as

εD =

N (dc < 50 cm; Ed ± 3σ; ... ; Ep > 1.5 MeV)
N (Ed ± 3σ; 1 < tc < 400 µs; Ep > 1.5 MeV)

.

(22)
The eﬃciency was determined relative to the number of
DCs with dc < 200 cm using the data of all 8 ADs with ac-
cidental backgrounds subtracted as shown in Fig. 5. The
eﬃciency curves and relative diﬀerences with respect to
the average are shown in Fig. 20. The eﬃciency for dc <
50 cm was about 75%. Because the total statistics of the
far-hall ADs was only about half that of a single near-
hall AD, the data of the four far-hall ADs were merged
together when calculating the relative diﬀerence. All the
diﬀerences were within ±0.4% at the 50-cm selection cri-
terion. Therefore, the AD-uncorrelated uncertainty of
the eﬃciency of the coincidence-distance criterion was
assigned to be 0.4%.

VII.5.

IBDs in Acrylic and Mineral Oil

The target materials were primarily liquid scintillator,
however, the IAV, OAV, and acrylic-encased reﬂectors
were in direct contact or close proximity with the scin-
tillators such that an IBD positron originating in these
elements could enter the scintillators and deposit suﬃ-
cient energy to trigger an AD. Such IBDs contributed an
estimated 1.0% of the nH-IBDs after selection.

IBD positrons originating in the MO rarely reached
the scintillator and generally produced an insuﬃcient
amount of light to trigger an AD. However, a few percent
of the IBD positrons annihilated in-ﬂight, producing a
higher-energy γ that was sometimes directed toward the
scintillator with enough energy to pass the low-energy
criterion. Some fraction of the corresponding IBD neu-
trons propagated to the LS and captured on H. From
simulation, it was estimated that approximately 0.06%
of the IBDs in the MO survived the selection criteria.

The total masses of GdLS and LS were measured when
ﬁlling each AD, using a load cell and Coriolis ﬂow meter,
respectively [58]. The masses of acrylic components were
measured with an industrial scale before ﬁlling [30]. The
relevant masses are given for each AD [35]. Only the
uncertainties of target mass were propagated to the ﬁnal
uncertainty of target proton number.

The average numbers of target protons in the GdLS,
LS, and acrylic volumes are 1.43× 1030, 1.54× 1030, and
0.18 × 1030, respectively. Values for each AD are pro-
vided [35]. The AD-uncorrelated uncertainties are listed
in Table III.

VII.7. Detector Leak

Around the end of July, 2012, when data-recording was
paused to install the ﬁnal two ADs, a leak began between
the LS and MO volumes of EH3-AD1. The levels of GdLS
and LS in the overﬂow tanks [60] (see Fig. 1) of EH3-AD1
slowly decreased while the level of MO slowly increased,
suggesting that the LS was leaking into the MO region.
This hypothesis was supported by measurements using
the MO clarity system [34] which showed signiﬁcant de-
creases in the transmission of shorter-wavelength light
through the MO and an increase of MO light yield over
time, consistent with a gradual addition of scintillator
into the MO. The hypothesis was further supported by
the observation of an increased (decreased) rate of higher-
energy (lower-energy) muons reconstructed in the MO
volume. These observed trends stabilized after about two
years with an estimated leakage of about 20 kg. This loss
of mass lowered the height of the LS level in the overﬂow
tank and did not directly impact the number of target
protons in the LS volume.

No impact on the detector response is expected in the
LS volume due to the direction of the leak; however, in
the MO volume, there is potential for an increase in trig-
ger rate. Given a 20-kg leakage into the 36-ton volume,
and assuming the light yield of the LS is two orders of
magnitude greater than that of the MO, one may naively
estimate an average increase of the light yield in the MO
volume on the order of 1%. In simulation, this increase
was modeled as an increase in the energy scale, and was
applied to prompt and delayed events of IBDs generated
in the MO, resulting in a O(0.001)% increase of the nH-
IBD selection eﬃciency. Indeed, no impact of the leak to
the nH-IBD analysis has been observed in comparisons of
various quantities before and after the start of the leak.
These quantities included various event rates, neutron-
capture energy peak and resolution, and IBD prompt and
delayed event-position distributions. Given the observed
stabilization of the leak, no impact is expected in the
future.

FIG. 20. Eﬃciency (top panel) and relative diﬀerence to the
average (bottom panel) vs.
coincidence-distance for corre-
lated double coincidences (NCor) in each AD. The data of the
far-hall ADs were combined in the bottom panel to increase
statistics. The diﬀerences are within ±0.4% at the criterion
of 50 cm.

This “spill-in” eﬀect from the MO was found to have a
negligible impact on the determination of sin22θ13 and
was not included in this analysis.

The impact of neutrons or γ’s (and their secondaries)
that spill-out into the MO, or spill-in/out between the
GdLS and LS, is naturally included in the prompt- and
delayed-energy selection eﬃciencies and their uncertain-
ties.

VII.6. Target Proton Number

The number of target protons Np was determined for
each AD from the measured target masses M and hy-
drogen mass-fractions wH of the GdLS, LS, and acrylic
volumes v:

Np,v = Mv wH,v NA / mH ,

(23)

where NA is Avogadro’s number and mH is the molar
mass of hydrogen.

The mass-fractions of hydrogen were determined by
combustion analysis to be about 12.0% for both GdLS
and LS (with uncertainties at the level of 0.1%) [34]. For
acrylic (C5H8O2), wH = 8.05%. The AD-uncorrelated
uncertainties of these quantities were taken to be negli-
gible as described for nH in Section VII.3.

The eﬃciencies of the PMT ﬂash rejection, prompt-
and delayed-energy selection, and coincidence-time se-
lection criteria were determined with simulation, while
the number of target protons, the muon-veto and multi-
plicity and coincidence-distance selection eﬃciencies were
determined with data. The AD-uncorrelated uncertain-
ties of these quantities were determined by comparing
data among the eight ADs.

The eﬃciency of the PMT ﬂash rejection criterion was
> 99.99% (see Section IV.2.1) and had a negligible un-
certainty. Muon-veto and multiplicity selection eﬃcien-
cies (εµ and εm) are listed in Table II and had negligible
AD-uncorrelated uncertainties. The product of the ef-
ﬁciencies of the prompt- and delayed-energy, and time
selection criteria were about 14%, 50%, and 5% in the
GdLS, LS, and acrylic volumes, respectively. The ef-
ﬁciency of the coincidence-distance criterion was deter-
mined as an average for all volumes: 75%. The AD-
uncorrelated uncertainties of these eﬃciencies are listed
for each detector volume v in Table III. The uncertainty
of the delayed-energy selection eﬃciency reduced from
0.5% [21] to 0.35% because of a new estimation and an
update of the original estimation to scale the number of
spallation neutrons with the number of target protons.
This reduced the uncertainty of the nH-IBD selection ef-
ﬁciency by 15%.

the Np are weighted when determining the combined uncer-

the estimated correlation coeﬃcients between the nH- and

Table III also gives the estimated correlation coeﬃ-
cients between the detector eﬃciencies of the nH- and
nGd-IBD analyses. The number of target protons were
fully correlated in the GdLS while uncorrelated in the LS
due to their identical and independent methods of mass
measurement, respectively. The eﬃciency of the prompt-
energy criterion was correlated through a common depen-
dence on energy scale, and was conservatively treated as
fully correlated. The coincidence-time criterion was also
treated as fully correlated. The delayed-energy criterion
was largely independent because the primary contribu-
tion to the uncertainty in the nH analysis was the varia-
tion of the 3σ selection, which does not exist in the nGd
analysis. The coincidence-distance criterion was uncorre-

21

lated because there was no such selection in the nGd-IBD
analysis. The overall correlation between the IBD detec-
tion eﬃciencies of the nH- and nGd-IBD analyses was
about 0.07.

The last row of Table II shows the ratio of the
eﬃciency- and target proton-corrected rates of IBDs for
the nH- and nGd-IBD analyses, for each AD. The errors
are the statistical, background, and AD-uncorrelated sys-
tematic uncertainties of both analyses. The consistency
of the eight values with one another reﬂects the consis-
tency of the selected number of IBDs, background esti-
mates, and per-AD target proton and eﬃciency correc-
tions, between the two analyses. The consistency of the
eight values with 1 reﬂects the accuracy of these values
for both analyses.

VIII. RESULTS

The measured and predicted IBD rates of each hall
are shown over time in Fig. 21. The measured rates are
background-subtracted and eﬃciency-corrected (εµεm).
The predictions are from Eq. (1) [i.e., Eqs. (2) and (12)],
and are adjusted with the best-ﬁt normalization factor 
from Eq. (28). The six reactors are seen to have oper-
ated continually at their nominal power output. The two
reactors nearby EH1 were refueled every 16 months and
the four reactors nearby EH2 were refueled every 8-12
months, each with 1-2 months downtime.

pected IBD rates assuming no oscillation. The sold red lines

measurements via Eq. (24). The ratios R of each energy
bin are shown in the bottom panel and demonstrate the
eﬀect of νe disappearance as a function of energy. The
best-ﬁt curve is the ratio of far-hall and normalized near-
hall predictions using Eq. (1) and the result for sin22θ13
presented in the next section.

VIII.1. Antineutrino Disappearance

The disappearance of νe is quantiﬁed without invoking
a model of neutrino oscillation and with minimal impact
from models of reactor antineutrino spectra, by directly
comparing the measured IBD rate at the far hall with
the rate expected based on the measurements at the near
halls. The expected number of IBDs in the far hall was
expressed as a combination of the two near-hall measure-
ments:

N EH3 ≡ αNEH1 + βNEH2,

(24)

where NEH1 and NEH2 are the measured numbers of IBDs
after subtracting all the backgrounds and correcting for
the muon-veto and multiplicity selection eﬃciencies (εµ
and εm) in EH1 and EH2.

Expressions for the weights α and β were determined
using Eq. (24) with the number of measured IBDs re-
placed by the number of predicted IBDs assuming no
oscillation. This number was calculated for experimental
hall i using Eq. (1) without oscillation:

where di denotes the d-th AD in experimental hall i and
the Nε do not include εm and εµ. The modiﬁed Eq. (24)
directly yields β = (N 3 − αN 1)/N 2. The weight α was
obtained by operating on the diﬀerence between the two
predictions for EH3: ∆N = N 3 − αN 1 − βN 2. The
variance of ∆N (σ2
∆) was obtained via error propagation
with respect to the reactor-uncorrelated relative uncer-
tainty (which was taken to be identical for all reactors),
and then its minimum was found with respect to α, yield-

This expression minimizes the impact of the reactor-
uncorrelated uncertainty.

For the 621-day data set used in this analysis,
α = 0.054 and β = 0.216. These values are dominated by
the baselines Ldr, and only slightly inﬂuenced by the in-
tegrated emission rates d2Nr(E, t)/dEdt. Thus, β, which
is associated with EH2, is four times larger than α pri-
marily because of the shorter baselines between EH3 and
the four reactors nearby EH2. The reactor-uncorrelated
uncertainty is suppressed by a factor of about 20, which
can be seen by evaluating the expression for σ2
∆.

Using Eq. (24) and the values of α and β, the ratio of
the observed to the expected number of IBDs at the far
hall was

VIII.2. Fit for sin22θ13

To determine sin22θ13, a χ2 was constructed with pull
terms for the background uncertainties and the AD- and
reactor-uncorrelated uncertainties:

where NDC,d is the number of measured double coinci-

of the accidental and correlated backgrounds derivable
from Table II, σDC,d is the statistical uncertainty of NDC,
and N IBD is the expected number of IBDs from Eq. (1),
which contains the oscillation parameter sin22θ13. The
ωd
r [35] are the fractions of IBDs in the d-th AD due to the
r-th reactor, which were calculated using Eq. (1) with-
out oscillation (including oscillation decreased the best-
ﬁt value of sin22θ13 by less than 0.03%). The reactor-
uncorrelated uncertainty (0.9%) is denoted as σR. The
parameter σD is the AD-uncorrelated uncertainty of IBD

is the combination of all background uncertainties, which
are given in Table II. There are twenty two correspond-
ing pull parameters denoted as αr, d, and ηd. The nor-
malization factor  was ﬁt and accounted for any biases
in the backgrounds Bd that were common to all halls
or detectors, and any biases in the predicted number of
IBDs N IBD,d that were common to all detectors; i.e., in
reactor-related models/quantities, the IBD cross-section
model, or IBD selection eﬃciencies.

Iterating over sin22θ13 with the eﬃciency correction
factors as described in Section VII.1.1, the best-ﬁt value
for both the normal and inverted neutrino-mass hierar-
chies was

sin2 2θ13 = 0.071 ± 0.011,

(29)

with a χ2

min per degree of freedom of 6.3/6.

Figure 23 shows the ratio of the measured rate to the
predicted rate assuming no oscillation, for each detector.
The most recent nGd result from Daya Bay [12] is in-
cluded for comparison. The 5.0%-deﬁcit of EH3 relative
to the near halls given in Eq. (27) is apparent. For the
nGd-IBD analysis, this deﬁcit was about 5.2%, and the
best-ﬁt value was sin22θ13 = 0.084. The red curve is the
oscillation survival probability Pν of Eq. (3) with a value
of sin22θ13 = 0.082 from the combination of the nH- and
nGd-IBD analyses, which is described in the next section.

they are presented as fractions of σ2

a quantity was estimated as σ2
total minus the square of the
ﬁt error when ﬁxing the nuisance parameter of said quan-
tity to its best-ﬁt value. The sum of the fractions is not
equal to 1 due to correlations. The statistical uncertainty
is the largest individual component. The second- and
third-largest uncertainties are those of the coincidence-
distance criterion and the delayed-energy criterion (see
Table III for the components of the detector contribu-
tion). The reactor-uncorrelated uncertainty is reduced
by a factor of 20, as in the relative expression of Eq. (27).

umn contains the estimated correlation coeﬃcients between
the nH- and nGd-IBD analyses.

VIII.3. nH-nGd Combined Result

The result for sin22θ13 from the current analysis was
combined with that from the most recent nGd-IBD spec-
tral analysis from Daya Bay [12]. The combination was
performed both analytically and via a simultaneous ﬁt
of the nGd-IBD and nH-IBD data sets. Correlations be-
tween the two analyses were estimated for eﬃciencies,
backgrounds, and reactor-related quantities.

The correlation coeﬃcients of the various uncertainty
components are listed in Tables III and IV. Reactor-
related uncertainties are fully correlated and statistical
uncertainties are uncorrelated. The correlation of quan-
tities with negligible uncertainty, such as DAQ time and
muon-veto eﬃciency, had negligible impact. The corre-
lation coeﬃcients of the detector-related quantities are
described in Section VII.8 and listed in Table III. The
accidental backgrounds were treated as uncorrelated be-
cause of the distinct methods and event samples used
in the nH- and nGd-IBD analyses. The Am-C back-
ground was estimated to have a correlation coeﬃcient of
0.7, while the other backgrounds were uncorrelated (see
Section VI).

The procedure to analytically combine the analyses is
the same as that used for the previous combination [21].
Updated values for backgrounds, eﬃciencies, and the
fraction of uncertainty due to statistics were taken from
Ref. [12], for the nGd-IBD analysis. For the nH-IBD

respectively.

Using the correlation coeﬃcients presented in this ar-
ticle, these values give an overall correlation coeﬃcient
of 0.02 between the two analyses, indicating essentially
independent determinations of sin22θ13. Though the cor-
relation will increase as the fraction of statistical uncer-
tainty decreases, this value is smaller than the previous
correlation coeﬃcient of 0.05 [21] primarily because of the
distinct estimation of the nH-9Li background and the sig-
niﬁcant reductions in the systematic uncertainties of the
Am-C backgrounds for both analyses.
sin22θ13 =
0.084 ± 0.005 and the nH-IBD result of 0.071 ± 0.011,
both the analytical calculation and simultaneous ﬁt
resulted in

which is an 8% improvement in precision.

VIII.4.

Independent Analysis

The present nH-IBD analysis was cross-checked with
an independent analysis based on a diﬀerent analysis
framework [61]. IBD candidates were independently se-
lected using the same criteria (see Table I) and the back-
grounds and muon-veto eﬃciencies were independently
evaluated. Using the χ2 in Eq. (28), the best-ﬁt value
was sin22θ13 = 0.071 ± 0.011, with a χ2
min per degree of
freedom of 6.4/6.

IX. DISCUSSION

The precision to which θ13 is determined is crucial to
constraining the leptonic CP phase δ [1–4]. The nH-IBD
analysis in this article provides an independent determi-
nation of sin22θ13 and improves the overall precision of
θ13.

Given that the uncertainty of the nH-IBD result is
dominated by the systematic uncertainties of the delayed-
energy and coincidence-distance criteria, improved preci-
sion is foreseen by reducing the uncertainties of the dis-
tance criterion with increased statistics, and the delayed-
energy criterion with an optimization of the selection.
In addition, improved precision will be achieved with a
spectral analysis of the prompt-energy spectrum, which
is underway. This will also provide a new determination
of the mass-squared diﬀerence ∆m2

32.

The analysis of nH-IBDs has helped to maximize the
ﬁducial volume of the ADs to supernova neutrinos [62].
It should also provide an opportunity to reduce the dom-
inant uncertainty of detection eﬃciency in the measure-
ment of reactor antineutrino ﬂux [43], given the lesser

24

sensitivity of the nH-IBD analysis to neutron spill-in/out
eﬀects. Furthermore, the data-driven techniques devel-
oped to study the accidental background and the IBD se-
lection criteria may be useful for other experiments that
use or plan to use nH-IBDs, such as JUNO [26], RENO-
50 [27], and LENA [28].

X. CONCLUSION

A sample of about 780000 nH-IBDs was obtained with
the 6-AD and full 8-AD conﬁgurations of the Daya Bay
experiment and was used to compare the number of re-
actor antineutrinos at far and near halls, yielding a new
independent determination of sin22θ13 = 0.071 ± 0.011.
The uncertainty is reduced by 40% compared with the
previous nH-IBD result primarily because of the factor
of 3.6 increase in statistics, but also because of the 15%
and 30% reductions in the uncertainties of the IBD selec-
tion eﬃciency and backgrounds, respectively. The new
result is consistent with that from the nGd-IBD anal-
ysis from Daya Bay, providing a valuable conﬁrmation
of the nGd-IBD result. Combining the nH- and nGd-
IBD results provides a new improved determination of
sin22θ13 = 0.082 ± 0.004.
