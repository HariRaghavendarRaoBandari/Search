ABSTRACT

Context. The supermassive black hole named Sgr A* is located at the dynamical center of the Milky Way. This closest supermassive
black hole is known to have a luminosity several orders of magnitude lower than the Eddington luminosity. Flares coming from the
Sgr A* environment can be observed in infrared, X-ray, and submillimeter wavelengths, but their origins are still debated. Interestingly,
the close passage of the Dusty S-cluster Object (DSO)/G2 near Sgr A* may increase the black hole ﬂaring activity and could therefore
help us to better constrain the radiation mechanisms from Sgr A*.
Aims. Our aim is to study the X-ray, infrared, and radio ﬂaring activity of Sgr A* close to the time of the DSO/G2 pericenter passage
in order to constrain the physical properties and origin of the ﬂares.
Methods. Simultaneous observations were made with XMM-Newton and WFC3 onboard HST during the period Feb–Apr 2014, in
addition to coordinated observations with SINFONI at ESO’s VLT, VLA in its A-conﬁguration, and CARMA.
Results. We detected two X-ray ﬂares on 2014 Mar. 10 and Apr. 2 with XMM-Newton, three near-infrared (NIR) ﬂares with HST on
2014 Mar. 10 and Apr. 2, and two NIR ﬂares on 2014 Apr. 3 and 4 with VLT. The X-ray ﬂare on 2014 Mar. 10 is characterized by a
long rise (∼7700 s) and a rapid decay (∼844 s). Its total duration is one of the longest detected so far in X-rays. Its NIR counterpart
peaked well before (4320 s) the X-ray maximum, implying a dramatic change in the X-ray-to-NIR ﬂux ratio during this event. This
NIR/X-ray ﬂare is interpreted as either a single ﬂare where variation in the X-ray-to-NIR ﬂux ratio is explained by the adiabatic
compression of a plasmon, or two distinct ﬂaring components separated by 1.2 h with simultaneous peaks in X-rays and NIR. We
identiﬁed an increase in the rising radio ﬂux density at 13.37 GHz on 2014 Mar. 10 with the VLA that could be the delayed radio
emission from a NIR/X-ray ﬂare that occurred before the start of our observation. The X-ray ﬂare on 2014 Apr. 2 occurred for
HST during the occultation of Sgr A* by the Earth, therefore we only observed the start of its NIR counterpart. With NIR synchrotron
emission from accelerated electrons and assuming X-rays from synchrotron self-Compton emission, the region of this NIR/X-ray ﬂare
has a size of 0.03−7 times the Schwarzschild radius and an electron density of 108.5–1010.2 cm−3, assuming a synchrotron spectral
index of 0.3−1.5. When Sgr A* reappeared to the HST view, we observed the decay phase of a distinct bright NIR ﬂare with no
detectable counterpart in X-rays. On 2014 Apr. 3, two 3.2-mm ﬂares were observed with CARMA, where the ﬁrst may be the delayed
(4.4 h) emission of a NIR ﬂare observed with VLT.
Conclusions. We observed a total of seven NIR ﬂares, with three having a detected X-ray counterpart. The physical parameters of the
ﬂaring region are less constrained for the NIR ﬂare without a detected X-ray counterpart, but none of the possible radiative processes
(synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton, or inverse Compton) can be ruled out for the production of the X-ray ﬂares. The three X-ray
ﬂares were observed during the XMM-Newton total eﬀective exposure of ∼ 256 ks. This ﬂaring rate is statistically consistent with
those observed during the 2012 Chandra XVP campaign, implying that no increase in the ﬂaring activity was triggered close to the
pericenter passage of the DSO/G2. Moreover, higher ﬂaring rates had already been observed with Chandra and XMM-Newton without
any increase in the quiescent level, showing that there is no direct link between an increase in the ﬂaring rate in X-rays and the change
in the accretion rate.

1. Introduction

Sgr A*, located at the dynamical center of our Galaxy, is cur-
rently a dormant supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass
M about 4 × 106 M(cid:12) (Schödel et al. 2002; Ghez et al.
2008; Gillessen et al. 2009). Its bolometric luminosity (Lbol ∼
1036 erg s−1) is lower than the Eddington luminosity (LEdd =

3.3 × 104 M/M(cid:12) L(cid:12) = 3 × 1044 erg s−1) (Yuan et al. 2003). This
low luminosity can be explained by radiatively ineﬃcient accre-
tion ﬂow models (RIAF) such as advection-dominated accretion
ﬂows (ADAF; Narayan et al. 1998) and jet-disk models. Because
of its proximity (d = 8 kpc; Genzel et al. 2010; Falcke & Markoﬀ
2013), Sgr A* is the best target to study the accretion and ejec-
tion physics for the case of low accretion rate, which is a regime

where SMBH’s are supposed to spend most of their lifetime. Its
physical understanding can be applied to a large number of nor-
mal galaxies that are supposed to host a SMBH.

Above Sgr A* quiescent emission, some episodes of in-
creased ﬂux are observed in X-rays, near-infrared (NIR), and
sub-millimeter/radio. These ﬂaring events from Sgr A* were ﬁrst
discovered in X-rays (Baganoﬀ et al. 2001) and were then also
observed in NIR (Genzel et al. 2003) and sub-millimeter wave-
lengths (Zhao 2003). NIR ﬂares, which happen several times
per day and have various amplitude up to 32 mJy (Witzel et al.
2012), are interpreted as synchrotron emission from acceler-
ated electrons close to the black hole (Eisenhauer et al. 2005;
Eckart et al. 2006). In the NIR, the synchrotron emission is op-
tically thick and the spectral index between the H and L band is
α = −0.62 ± 0.1 with S ν ∝ να (Witzel et al. 2014b). The X-ray
ﬂaring rate is 1.0−1.3 ﬂares per day (Neilsen et al. 2013), but two
episodes of higher ﬂaring activity in X-rays have been observed
(Porquet et al. 2008; Neilsen et al. 2013). Most X-ray ﬂares have
moderate amplitude (Neilsen et al. 2013) with 2–45 times the
quiescent luminosity of Sgr A* (about 3.6 × 1033 erg s−1 in 2−8
keV; Baganoﬀ et al. 2003; Nowak et al. 2012), but brighter ﬂares
with amplitudes up to 160 times the quiescent level have also
been observed (Porquet et al. 2003, 2008; Nowak et al. 2012).
Several emission mechanism models are proposed in order to ex-
plain X-ray ﬂares, such as: synchrotron (Dodds-Eden et al. 2009;
Barrière et al. 2014), synchrotron self-Compton (Eckart et al.
2008), and inverse Compton (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2006b; Wardle
2011; Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2012) emissions. During simultaneous
NIR/X-ray observations, X-ray ﬂares always have a NIR coun-
terpart and their light curves have similar shapes, with an appar-
ent delay less than 3 min between the peaks of ﬂare emission
(Eckart et al. 2006; Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2006a; Dodds-Eden et al.
2009). The sub-millimeter and radio ﬂare peaks, however, are
delayed several tens of minutes and hours, respectively (Mar-
rone et al. 2008; Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2008, 2009), and are pro-
posed to be due to synchrotron radiation of an expanding rela-
tivistic plasma blob with an adiabatic cooling (Yusef-Zadeh et al.
2006a). Considering the intrinsic size of Sgr A* at a wavelength
λ of (0.52 ± 0.03) mas × (λ/cm)1.3±0.1, the time lag between the
sub-millimeter and radio light curves suggests a collimated out-
ﬂow (Brinkerink et al. 2015). On 2012 May 17, a NIR ﬂare was
followed 4.5±0.5 h later by a 7-mm ﬂare that was observed with
the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and localized 1.5 mas
southeast of Sgr A*, providing evidence for an adiabatically ex-
panding jet with a speed of 0.4 ± 0.3 c (Rauch et al. 2016).

Gillessen et al. (2012) reported the detection of the object
named G2 on its way towards Sgr A* in an eccentric keple-
rian orbit with the 2004 data from the Very Large Telescope
(VLT) using the Spectrograph for INtegral Field Observations
in the Near-Infrared (SINFONI) and the Nasmyth Adaptive Op-
tics System (NAOS) and COudé Near-IR Camera (CONICA),
i.e., NACO. Their observations of the redshifted emission lines
Brγ, Brδ, and HeI in the NIR between 2004 and 2011 allowed
them to determine the pericenter passage of 2013.51±0.04. They
developed the ﬁrst interpretation of the nature of the G2 object
based on the observation of these lines: a compact gas blob. From
the M-band they showed that G2 has a dust temperature consis-
tent with 450 K. They predicted that, because G2 moves super-
sonically through the ambient hot gas, a bow shock should be
created close to the pericenter passagei, which should be seen
from radio to X-rays. The observation of such X-ray emission
could help to put some constraints on the physical characteris-
tics of the ambient medium around Sgr A*. The compact gas
blob interpretation was still favored by Gillessen et al. (2013a)

who analyzed the Brγ line width using data from SINFONI and
NACO in March−July 2012. They derived a pericenter passage
of 2013.69 ± 0.04, adding their observations to those between
2004 and 2011. A velocity-position diagram of G2 was com-
puted by Gillessen et al. (2013b) using the emission lines Brγ,
HeI, and Paα from SINFONI and NACO observations in April
2013. An elongation of G2 in the direction of its orbit was seen in
the velocity-position diagram, which, together with the low dust
temperature, favored the interpretation of an ionized gas cloud.
Two other interpretations based on the observations of these
emission lines were also developed. The ﬁrst one was proposed
by Burkert et al. (2012): a spherical gas shell, which was sup-
ported by a simulation that reproduced the observed elongated
structure in the velocity proﬁle. They also simulated the ef-
fects of tidal shearing produced by Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-
Helmholtz instabilities during its approach to Sgr A* (Morris
2012). The shearing should produce a fragmentation of the en-
velope of G2 and provide fresh matter that would accrete onto
Sgr A*. This should increase the ﬂaring activity of Sgr A*, de-
pending on the ﬁlling factor, or (re-)activate the Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN) phase during the subsequent years. The other in-
terpretation is a dust-enshrouded stellar source, ﬁrst developed
by Eckart et al. (2013), which leads to the second name of G2:
a Dusty S-cluster Object (DSO). This classiﬁcation is supported
by its detection in the Ks- and K(cid:48)-bands in observations from
NACO and the NIRC2 camera of the Keck Observatory, respec-
tively. The M-band measurements showed that the integrated lu-
minosity of this object is 5 − 10 L(cid:12). Moreover, the L-band emis-
sion remained constant and spatially unresolved from 2004 to
2014, which ruled out a coreless model (Witzel et al. 2014a).
The compact nature of the source is also supported by SINFONI
observations between February and September 2014 (Valencia-
S. et al. 2015). They showed that the wide range of Brγ line
widths (200 − 700 km s−1) is reproduced well by the emission
from a pre-main sequence star, because the magnetospheric ac-
cretion of circumstellar matter on the photosphere of these young
stars emits the Brγ line. The tidal stretching of the accretion disk
around the star as DSO/G2 approaches pericenter may explain
the increase of the Brγ line width. A star with a mass of 1−2 M(cid:12)
and a luminosity less than 10 L(cid:12) agrees with the dust temperature
of 450 K found by Gillessen et al. (2012). As Valencia-S. et al.
(2015) observed the blueshifted Brγ line after 2014 May, they
were able to improve the estimation of the time of the pericenter
passage to 2014.39± 0.14 and a distance of ∼163 au (4075 grav-
itational radius) from Sgr A*. For comparison, the B0 spectral-
type star S2 with a 15.2-year orbit around Sgr A* has a 1.3 times
smaller pericenter distance (Schödel et al. 2002). The absence of
a redshifted counterpart after the pericenter passage favored the
interpretation of the nature of DSO/G2 as a compact object and
still ruled out the coreless model.

The multiwavelength campaign presented here was designed
in 2012 to study the impact of the passage of the DSO/G2 ob-
ject close to the SMBH (based on the pericenter date predicted
by Gillessen et al. 2012) from the NIR/X-ray ﬂaring activity of
Sgr A*. We report the results of joint observations of Sgr A* be-
tween February and April 2014 with the X-ray Multi-Mirror mis-
sion (XMM-Newton) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
(XMM-Newton AO-12; PI: N. Grosso), close to the pericenter
passage of DSO/G2. We also obtained coordinated observations
with the VLT, the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-
wave Astronomy (CARMA), and the Karl Jansky Very Large
Array (VLA) to investigate NIR ﬂaring emission and delayed
millimeter/radio ﬂaring emission. In Sect. 2 we present the ob-
servations and data reduction. In Sect. 3 we report the analysis

During the ﬁrst three XMM-Newton observations, the two
EPIC/MOS cameras (Turner et al. 2001) and the EPIC/pn cam-
era (Strüder et al. 2001) observed in frame window mode. Dur-
ing the last observation, the two MOS cameras were in small
window mode and the pn camera observed in frame window
mode. All observations were made with the medium ﬁlter. The
eﬀective observation start and end times are reported in Table
1 in Universal Time (UT). During these observations, the con-
version from the Terrestrial Time (TT) registered aboard XMM-
Newton to UT is UT = TT− 67.108s (NASA’s HEASARC Tool:
xTime1). The total eﬀective exposure for the four XMM-Newton
observations during this campaign is ≈ 256 ks.

position

The XMM-Newton data reduction is the same as presented in
Mossoux et al. (2015a). We used the Science Analysis Software
(SAS) package (version 13.5) with the 2014 Apr. 4 release of
the Current Calibration ﬁles (CCF) to reduce and analyze the
data. The tasks emchain and epchain were used to create the
event lists for the MOS and pn camera, respectively. The soft
proton ﬂare count rate in the full detector light curve in the 2−10
keV energy range was high (up to 0.02 count s−1 arcmin−2 in
EPIC/pn) only during the last two hours of the third observation.
As we looked for variability of the X-ray emission from
Sgr A*, we extracted events of
the source+background
region from a disk of 10(cid:48)(cid:48)-radius centered on the VLBI
of Sgr A*: RA(J2000)=17h45m40s.0409,
radio
Dec(J2000)=−29◦00(cid:48)28(cid:48)(cid:48).118 (Reid et al. 1999). The con-
tribution of the background events was estimated by extracting
a ≈ 3(cid:48) × 3(cid:48) region at ≈ 4(cid:48) -north of Sgr A* on the same CCD
where the X-ray emission is low. For the last observation, the
background extraction region was a ≈ 3(cid:48) × 3(cid:48) area at ≈ 7(cid:48) -east
of Sgr A* on the adjacent CCD because of the small window
mode.
The light curves of the source+background and background
regions were created from events with PATTERN≤ 12 and
#XMMEA_SM and PATTERN≤ 4 and FLAG==0 for the MOS and
pn cameras, respectively. These light curves are computed in
the 2−10 keV energy range using a time bin of 300 s. The task
epiclccorr applies relative corrections to those light curves.
We then summed the background-subtracted light curves of the
three cameras to produce the total EPIC light curves. Missing
values were inferred using a scaling factor between the pn cam-
era and the sum of the MOS1 and MOS2 cameras. This factor
was computed during the full time period where all detectors
are observing and leads to a number of pn counts that is equal,
on average, to 1.46±0.03 times the sum of the number of MOS
counts.

To perform the timing analysis of the light curves we adapted
the Bayesian-blocks method developed by Scargle (1998) and
reﬁned by Scargle et al. (2013a) to the XMM-Newton event lists,
using a two-step algorithm to correct for any detector ﬂaring
background (Mossoux et al. 2015a,b)2. We used the false detec-

2 Worpel & Schwope (2015) tested diﬀerent photon-weighting in order
to subtract the background during observations of bursting and eclipsing
objects in X-rays. The equation for the Voronoi time-interval weighting
used in Mossoux et al. (2015a,b) follows the recipe of Scargle et al.
(2013b), which is identical to the “alternative” photon-weighting de-
scribed in Sect. 4.6 of Worpel & Schwope (2015) since the photon-
weighting is equal to the inverse of the Voronoi time-interval weighting.
We can see in Fig. 12 of Worpel & Schwope (2015) that the method of
Mossoux et al. (2015a,b) (labeled h in this ﬁgure) locates the eclipses,
as well as their weighted-photon method (labeled f in this ﬁgure). As

Sect. 5 we constrain the physical parameters of the ﬂaring re-
gion associated with the NIR ﬂares and their X-ray counterparts.
In Sect. 6 we discuss the X-ray ﬂaring rate observed during this
campaign. Finally, in Sect. 7 we summarize our main results and

2. Observations and data reduction
Here we present the schedule of the coordinated observations of
the 2014 Feb.−Apr. campaign (Fig. 1) followed by a description
of the data reduction for each facility used during this campaign.

2.1. XMM-Newton observations
Table 1 reports the log of the XMM-Newton campaign for 2014
Feb.−Apr (AO-12; PI: N. Grosso). The last X-ray observation
is an anticipated Target of Opportunity (ToO) that was triggered
to observe the new ﬂaring magnetar SGR J1745-29 (AO-12; PI:
G.L. Isra¨el). We only use the data from the EPIC camera since
the optical extinction towards the Galactic center is too high to
get optical or soft X-ray photons from Sgr A* with the Optical-
UV Monitor or the Reﬂection Grating Spectrometers.

curves by applying a density estimator (Silverman 1986; Feigel-
son & Babu 2012) and using the same method as in Mossoux
et al. (2015a) to correct the exposure time and the background
contribution to the source+background event list. The amplitude
and time of the ﬂare maximum were computed on the smoothed
light curve with a window width of 100s and 500s and a time
grid interval of 10s.

2.2. HST observations

The NIR observations of Sgr A* were obtained with the
Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on HST, under joint XMM-
Newton/HST programs 13403 (AO-12, PI: N. Grosso) and
13316 (Cycle 21, PI: H. Bushouse) in order to measure the delay
between X-ray ﬂares and their NIR counterparts. Sgr A* was ob-
served in four visits with 7 − 10 consecutive HST orbits, whose
observation start and end times are reported in UT in Table 2.
The total eﬀective exposure for these four HST visits during the
2014 Feb.−Apr. campaign is about 69 ks. Exposures were taken
constantly during each part of these windows in which Sgr A*
was visible to HST, usually resulting in an uninterrupted cadence
of exposures lasting for 40–50 minutes at a time, and then in-
terrupted for the remaining 40–50 minutes of each HST orbit
in which Sgr A* is occulted by the Earth. The four visits were
planned to have the maximum number of consecutive orbits be-
fore HST entered the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), in order
to maximize the simultaneous observing time in NIR and X-ray.
Each WFC3 exposure was taken with the IR channel of the
camera, which has a 1024 × 1024 pixel HgCdTe array, with
a pixel scale of ∼ 0(cid:48)(cid:48).13. We used the F153M ﬁlter, which is
a medium-bandwidth ﬁlter (∆λ = 0.683 µm) with an eﬀec-
tive wavelength λeﬀ = 1.53157 µm (from the Spanish Virtual
Observatory3). Each exposure used the predeﬁned readout se-
quence “SPARS25” with NSAMP=12 or 13, which produces
non-destructive readouts of the detector every 25 secs through-
out the exposure, and a total of 12 or 13 readouts, resulting in
a total exposure time of 275 − 300 s after discarding the ﬁrst
short (2.932 s) readout. The exposures were obtained in a 4-point
dither pattern centered on Sgr A*, with a spacing of ∼ 0.6 arc-
sec (∼ 4 pixels) per step to improve the sampling of the Point
Spread Function (PSF) of FWHM= 0(cid:48)(cid:48).145 (1.136 detector pix-

may produce both negative and implausibly high count rates. Indeed,
the method of Mossoux et al. (2015a,b) produces much fewer Bayesian
blocks with negative count rates and no implausibly high count rates in
comparison to their weighted-photon method (see for comparison panel
h and f of Fig. 12 of Worpel & Schwope 2015). This last point is crucial
for ﬂare and burst detection.

els) at 1.50 µm (Dressel 2012)4. All of the WFC3 exposures
were calibrated using the standard STScI calibration pipeline
task calwf3. Once the pointing information was set for each
WFC3 exposure, we could safely use the known relative posi-
tion of Sgr A* for positioning a photometry aperture (Sgr A*
itself cannot be easily identiﬁed in the WFC3 images because it
is in the PSF wings of the star S2 located at 0(cid:48)(cid:48).15 during our ob-
servational epoch according to the orbital elements of Gillessen
et al. 2009).

The absolute coordinates of HST exposures are limited by
uncertainties in the positions of the guide stars that are used to
acquire and track the target. We therefore used the radio position
of IRS-16C (also known as S96; Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2014), a star
near Sgr A*, as an astrometric reference to accurately register
the pointing of each WFC3 exposure. The radio position of IRS-
16C came from VLA observations in February 2014, which is
nearly co-eval with the HST observations.

The accumulating, non-destructive readouts of each cali-
brated exposure were “unraveled” by taking the diﬀerence of
adjacent readouts, which results in a series of independent sam-
ples taken at 25 sec intervals, thereby increasing the time res-
olution for the subsequent photometric analysis. Photometry of
Sgr A* was performed with the IRAF routine phot, using a 3-
pixel (∼ 0.4 arcsec) diameter circular aperture centered on the
known radio coordinates of Sgr A* (Petrov et al. 2011; Yusef-
Zadeh et al. 2014).

Initial analysis of the photometry results for Sgr A* and other
stars in the ﬁeld revealed an overall tendency for the ﬂuxes of in-
dividual sources to gradually decrease on the order of ∼3% dur-
ing the course of each individual exposure (i.e., across the span
of multiple readouts). We believe this eﬀect is due to persistence
within an individual exposure, as the total signal level reaches
fairly high levels by the end of each ∼5 min exposure. We mea-
sured this trend for stars near Sgr A* and applied the results to
the Sgr A* photometry to remove the eﬀect. When applied to
other stars in the ﬁeld, the corrected photometry was constant,
on average, throughout each exposure. The error on the photom-
etry obtained in each of the four visits, within an individual 25
s readout interval, is 0.0044, 0.0046, 0.0022, and 0.0042 mJy,
respectively, which has been estimated from the standard devia-
tion of the ﬂux density of a reference star. For comparison, sim-
ilar observations obtained in the past using NICMOS camera 1
have an uncertainty within a bin of 32 s of 0.002 mJy at 1.60 µm
(Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2006b).

Aperture and extinction corrections were also applied to the
Sgr A* photometry. The aperture correction was determined by
measuring the curves of growth of several isolated stars in the
ﬁeld, using a series of apertures of increasing size. The correc-
tion factor for an aperture diameter of 3 pixels is 1.414. The ex-
tinction correction was derived from A(H) = 4.35 ± 0.12 mag
and A(Ks) = 2.46 ± 0.03 mag (Schödel et al. 2010) with
λeﬀ(NACO H) = 1.63725 µm and λeﬀ(NACO Ks) = 2.12406 µm
(from the Spanish Virtual Observatory), respectively, assuming a
power law leading to A(λ) ∝ λ−2.19±0.06. Thus, the computed ex-
tinction for the eﬀective wavelength of the WFC3 F153M ﬁlter
(λeﬀ = 1.53157 µm) used is 5.03± 0.20 mag, which corresponds
to a multiplicative factor of 103.2 ± 19.0 to correct the observed
ﬂux density for extinction.

4 For comparison, the FWHM of the NICMOS Camera 1 is 0(cid:48)(cid:48).16 (3.75
detector pixels) at 1.60 µm (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2006b), i.e., better sam-
pled than the FWHM of the WFC3 camera.

2.3. VLT observations

Near-infrared integral-ﬁeld observations of the Galactic Center
were performed using SINFONI at the VLT in Chile (Eisenhauer
et al. 2003; Bonnet et al. 2004). Sgr A* was monitored nine times
in 2014 Feb.−Apr.. Table 3 summarizes the observing log, in-
cluding the amount of exposures that were selected for the anal-
ysis. The selection criteria is described below. These observa-
tions were planned to be coordinated with those carried out with
XMM-Newton. Two of these observations were simultaneous
with XMM-Newton observations and one was partially simul-
taneous. They are part of the ESO programs 092.B-0183(H) (PI:
A. Eckart), 093.B-0932(A) (PI: N. Grosso), and 092.B-0920(A)
(PI: N. Grosso) presented in Valencia-S. et al. (2015) for the
DSO/G2 study.

The SINFONI instrument is an integral-ﬁeld unit fed by an
adaptive optics (AO) module. The AO module was locked on a
bright star 8(cid:48)(cid:48).85 east and 15(cid:48)(cid:48).54 north of Sgr A*. The H + K
grating used in these observations covers the 1.45µm − 2.45µm
range and exhibits a spectral resolution of R ∼ 1500 (which cor-
responds to approximately 200 km s−1 at 2.16 µm). The smallest
SINFONI ﬁeld of view (0(cid:48)(cid:48).8 × 0(cid:48)(cid:48).8) was jittered around the po-
sition of S2. Observations of diﬀerent B- and G-type stars were
performed for further telluric corrections.

Exposure times of 400 s were used to observe the Galac-
tic center region,followed or preceded by observations on a
dark cloud located about 12(cid:48)45(cid:48)(cid:48) west and 5(cid:48)36(cid:48)(cid:48) north of the
Sgr A* sky position. These integration times were chosen to
fully sample the variations of Sgr A* ﬂux density over typical
ﬂare lengths, while optimizing the quality of the data.

The data processing and calibration was performed as de-
scribed in Valencia-S. et al. (2015) and it is outlined here for
completeness. First, bad lines were corrected using the proce-
dure suggested in the SINFONI user manual. Then, a rough
cosmic-ray correction in the sky and target exposures was per-
formed using the algorithm of Pych (2004). Some science and
calibration ﬁles showed random patterns that were detected and
removed following the algorithms proposed by Smaji´c et al.
(2014). Afterwards, the SINFONI pipeline was used for the stan-
dard reduction steps (e.g., ﬂat ﬁelding and bad pixel corrections)
and for the wavelength calibration. A deep correction of cosmic
rays and the atmospheric refraction eﬀects were done using our
own DPUSER routines (Thomas Ott, MPE Garching; see also
Eckart & Duhoux 1991).

The quality of individual exposures was judged based on the
point-spread function (PSF) at the moment of the observation.

The PSF was estimated by ﬁtting a 2D Gaussian to the bright
star S2. Data cubes where the full width at half maximum of the
Gaussian was higher than 96 mas (or 7.65 detector pixels) were
discarded in the analysis. The 2014 Feb. 28, Mar. 1, and Mar. 2
observations are thus not used because of their poor quality. On
2014 Apr. 2 two data cubes of larger ﬁeld-of-view were used for
pointing. They were not included in the light curves since they
map regions just beside the central S-cluster. Flux calibration on
individual data cubes was performed using aperture photometry
on the deconvolved K-band image. The deconvolution was done
using the Lucy–Richardson algorithm in DPUSER. For calibra-
tion we used the stars S2 (Ks = 14.13), S4 (Ks = 14.61), S10
(Ks = 14.12), and S12 (Ks = 15.49), and adopted the Ks-band
extinction correction A(Ks) = 2.46 ± 0.03 mag (Schödel et al.
2010). Additional information on the ﬂux estimation is given by
Witzel et al. (2012). The ﬁnal ﬂux densities were extracted by
ﬁtting a 2D Gaussian to the calibrated continuum images for all
time steps.

2.4. VLA observations

Radio continuum observations were carried out with the Karl
G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) on 2014 March 1, March
10 and April 2 (observing program 14A-231). The VLA was in
its A-conﬁguration during these three days of observations, with
start and stop times reported in Table 4. In all observations, we
used 3C286 to calibrate the ﬂux density scale, both 3C286 and
NRAO530 to calibrate the bandpass, and J1744-3116 to calibrate
the complex gains.
On 2014 Mar. 1 we observed Sgr A* at 8−10 GHz (X-Band)
using the 8-bit sampler system with 2 GHz total bandwidth, each
consisting of 64 channels each 2 MHz wide. On 2014 Mar. 10
we used the same correlator setup as 2014 Mar. 1, except using
the Ku-Band between 13 and 15 GHz. On 2014 Apr. 2 we used
the two bands 5−7 GHz (C-band) and 1−2 GHz (L-band), and
alternated between these bands every 7 minutes. The C-band cor-
relator was set-up similarly to that of X-band. The L-band corre-
lator, however, used 1 GHz of bandwidth, which consisted of 16
IFs with channel widths of 1 MHz each. After primary calibra-
tion using OBIT (Cotton 2008), a self-calibration procedure was
applied using AIPS in phase only, to remove atmospheric phase
errors.

2.5. CARMA observations
Observations of Sgr A* at 95 GHz (corresponding to 3.2 mm)
were obtained with CARMA on 2014 Mar. 10, Apr. 2, and Apr.
3 (see Table 5). The array was in the C-conﬁguration, with an-
tenna separations ranging from 30–350 meters. The correlator
processed frequencies range was 88.76−93.24 GHz in the lower
sideband of the receivers and 96.76−101.24 GHz in the upper
sideband. The spectral resolution was 25 MHz after Hanning
smoothing. Channels corresponding to strong absorption lines
of HCO+ (89.19 GHz), HNC (90.65 GHz), and CS (97.98 GHz)
were dropped from Sgr A* data before averaging to get the
continuum ﬂux density. Only visibility data corresponding to
telescope separations larger than 20 kλ were used for the ﬂux
measurements, to reduce contamination from extended emission
near Sgr A*.

Observations of 3C279 were used to calibrate the instrumen-
tal passband. The ﬂux density scale was established from ob-
servations of Neptune, assuming it is a 2(cid:48)(cid:48).2 diameter disk with
brightness temperature 123 K (consistent with the Butler-JPL-
Horizons 2012 model shown in ALMA memo 594). Observa-
tions of a secondary ﬂux calibrator (the blazar 1733-130, a.k.a.
NRAO 530) were interleaved with the Sgr A* observations ev-
ery 15 minutes to monitor the antenna gains. The ﬂux density of
1733-130 was measured to be 2.7±0.3 Jy on 2014 Mar. 10, and
2.5±0.3 Jy on Apr. 2 and Apr. 3, relative to Neptune.

The data on Mar. 10 were obtained in turbulent weather and
are of poor quality, therefore we do not use it in this work. On
2014 Apr. 2 we only use the data before the beginning of the
snow at about 12:30 UT.

3. Data analysis
3.1. XMM-Newton data
Figure 2 shows the XMM-Newton/EPIC (pn+MOS1+MOS2)
background-subtracted light curves of Sgr A* binned to 300 s
in the 2−10 keV energy range. The non-ﬂaring level (i.e., the
longest interval of the Bayesian blocks) during 2014 Feb.−Apr.
is about 3 times the typical value of 0.18 count s−1 (e.g., Por-
quet et al. 2008; Mossoux et al. 2015a). This is due to the ﬂar-
ing magnetar SGR J1745-29 located only 2(cid:48)(cid:48).4 from Sgr A* (Rea
et al. 2013). Because the radius enclosing 50% of the energy for
EPIC/pn at 1.5 keV on-axis is about 10(cid:48)(cid:48) (Ghizzardi 2002), we
extract the events from a 10(cid:48)(cid:48)-radius circle centered on Sgr A*
as done in previous studies. This extraction region therefore in-
cludes events from SGR J1745-29, which artiﬁcially increases
the non-ﬂaring level of Sgr A* (Fig. 2).

3.1.1. Impact of the magnetar on the ﬂare detection
Degenaar et al. (2013) reported a large ﬂare towards Sgr A*
detected by Swift on 2013 Apr. 24. The detection of a hard
X-ray burst by BAT near Sgr A* on 2013 Apr. 25 led Ken-
nea et al. (2013) to attribute this ﬂux increase to a new Soft
Gamma Repeater unresolved from Sgr A*: SGR J1745-29. The
X-ray spectrum of this magnetar is an absorbed blackbody with
NH = 13.7+1.3−1.2 × 1022 cm−2 and kTBB = 1.06± 0.06 keV (Kennea
et al. 2013). But the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) results
between 1 and 10 keV from Coti Zelati et al. (2015) show that
the temperature of the blackbody emitting region decreases with
time: kTBB/keV = (0.85 ± 0.01) − (1.77 ± 0.04) × 10−4(t − t0)
with t0 the time of the peak outburst (i.e., 2013 Apr. 24 or 56406
in MJD). They show that before 100 d from outburst, the mag-

Article number, page 6 of 26

netar luminosity between 1 and 10 keV is characterized by a
linear model plus an exponential decay whose e-folding time
is 37 ± 2 d. After 100 d from the burst activation, the mag-
netar ﬂux is well ﬁtted by an exponential with an e-folding
time of 253 ± 5 d. This ﬂux decay is one of the slower de-
cays observed for a magnetar. Thanks to 8 months of obser-
vations with the Green Bank Telescope and 18 months of ob-
servations with the Swift’s X-Ray Telescope, the evolution of
the X-ray ﬂux and spin period of the magnetar bf have been
well constrained by Lynch et al. (2015). The X-ray ﬂux be-
tween 2 and 10 keV in a 20(cid:48)(cid:48)-radius extraction region cen-
tered on the magnetar decreases as the sum of two exponentials:
F(t) = (1.00±0.06) e−(t−t0)/(55±7 d) +(0.98±0.07) e−(t−t0)/(500±41 d)
in unit of 10−11 erg s−1 cm−2 with t0 the same as in Coti Zelati
et al. (2015).

We determined the exponential decay of the magnetar ﬂux
between 2 and 10 keV by applying a chi-squared ﬁtting of
the non-ﬂaring level of each observation computed using the
Bayesian-blocks algorithm: on Feb. 28, Mar. 10, and Apr. 2
and 3 the non-ﬂaring level is 0.562 ± 0.003, 0.528 ± 0.004,
0.489±0.003 and 0.499±0.002 EPIC count s−1, respectively. The
magnetar ﬂux variation can be described as N(t) = N0 e−(t−t0)/τ
with t the time corresponding to the middle of each observa-
tion, t0 and N0 the time and count rate of the non-ﬂaring level
of the ﬁrst observation, and τ the decay time scale. Our best
ﬁt parameters with corresponding 1-σ uncertainties are: N0 =
0.558 ± 0.003 count s−1 and τ = 281 ± 15 days. The decay time
scale is about 2 times shorter than those computed from the for-
mula of Lynch et al. (2015) for this date. However, as we can see
in Fig. 2 of Lynch et al. (2015), the magnetar ﬂux is not a per-
fect exponential decay and has some local increase of the ﬂux,
in particular during our observing period. This is seen in the last
XMM-Newton/EPIC pn observation on 2014 Apr. 3, which is
characterized by two blocks whose change point is at 16:27:48
(UTC). The corresponding count rates for the ﬁrst and second
blocks are 0.254 ± 0.03 and 0.299 ± 0.03 pn count s−1. By fold-
ing light curves for each block on this date with the magnetar
spin period of 3.76398106 s computed in Appendix B, we see
that the pulse shape has not changed, but the ﬂux increased by
a factor of about 1.2, as determined by the Bayesian-blocks al-
gorithm. Moreover, the Chandra monitoring of DSO/G2 shows
that there is no signiﬁcant increase of Sgr A* ﬂux on 2014 Apr.
4 (Haggard et al. 2014).

This contamination of the non-ﬂaring level implies a de-
crease of the detection level of the faintest and shortest ﬂares,
as explained in details in Appendix A. Comparing the detection
probability of an XMM-Newton observation with the distribu-
tion of ﬂares during the 2012 Chandra XVP campaign (Neilsen
et al. 2013), we estimate that we lost no more than one ﬂare
during our four XMM-Newton observations due to the magnetar
contribution.

3.1.2. X-ray ﬂare detection
By applying the Bayesian-blocks analysis on the EPIC event
lists, we are able to detect two ﬂares: one on 2014 Mar. 10 and
one on 2014 Apr. 2. These ﬂares are labeled 1 to 2 in Fig. 2.
Figures 3 and 4 focus on the EPIC (pn+MOS1+MOS2) and
EPIC/pn ﬂare light curves with a bin time interval of 500 and
100 s, respectively. The comparison of the ﬂare light curves ob-
served by each EPIC cameras can be found in appendix C. The
second ﬂare is detected by the Bayesian-blocks algorithm in pn,
but not in MOS1 or MOS2. This is explained by the lower sen-
sitivity of the MOS cameras, resulting in a lower detection level

of the algorithm (see Fig. A.1). Table 6 gives the temporal char-
acteristics of these X-ray ﬂares.

We removed the magnetar contribution from the Sgr A*
EPIC/pn event list in order to increase the detection level of the
ﬂares. This was done by computing the period and period deriva-
tive of SGR J1745-29 and ﬁltering out time intervals where the
magnetar ﬂux is less than 50% of its total ﬂux (see Appendix
B for details). We only work with EPIC/pn, because it has a

description.

better temporal resolution (73.4 ms) than the EPIC/MOS cam-
eras (2.6 s; ESA: XMM-Newton SOC 2013). By applying the
Bayesian-blocks analysis on the ﬁltered pn event lists, we ﬁnd
no additional ﬂares, and the start and end times of the already
detected ﬂares do not change signiﬁcantly.
The ﬂare detected on 2014 Mar. 10 is characterized by a
long rise (∼ 7700 s) and a rapid decay (∼ 844 s). This is
one of the longest ﬂares ever observed in X-ray, with a du-
ration of about 8.5 ks. For comparison, the largest ﬂare ob-
served during the Chandra XVP 2012 campaign has a duration
of 7.9 ks and the ﬁrst ﬂare detected from Sgr A* observed by
Baganoﬀ et al. (2001) had a duration of ∼ 10 ks. In EPIC/pn, the
Bayesian-blocks algorithm divides the ﬂare into two blocks, but

in EPIC/MOS1 and MOS2 this ﬂare is described with only one
Bayesian block.

To localize the origin of this ﬂaring emission we focus on
the MOS observations, which provide a good sampling of the
X-ray PSF (FWHM ∼ 4(cid:48)(cid:48).3) thanks to their 1(cid:48)(cid:48).1 × 1(cid:48)(cid:48).1 pixels.
We ﬁrst compute sky images that match the detector sampling
for the ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring periods, and then we look for any
signiﬁcant excess counts during the ﬂaring period compared to
the non-ﬂaring one, using the Bayesian method of Kraft et al.
(1991).

We have suppressed the randomization of the event position
inside the detector pixel during the production of the event list,
therefore the event is assigned to the center of the detector pixel
and its sky coordinates are reconstructed from the spacecraft at-
titude with an angular resolution of 0(cid:48)(cid:48).05. We ﬁlter the X-ray
events using the (softer) #XMMEA_EM ﬂag (e.g., bad rows are
ﬁltered out, keeping adjacent rows) and we select only events
with the best positioning (single-pixel events, corresponding to
pattern=0) and 2–10 keV energy. We ﬁrst assess the mean sky
position of the detector pixel that was the closest to Sgr A* by
comparing the event sky positions with the pattern of the space-
craft oﬀsets from the mean pointing that we derived from the at-
titude history ﬁle (*SC*ATS.FIT). We then compute images and
exposure maps centered on this sky position with 1(cid:48)(cid:48).1× 1(cid:48)(cid:48).1 sky-
pixels for the ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring periods (see Appendix C
for the deﬁnition of the Bayesian blocks). There is no moiré
eﬀect in these images, because the mean position-angle of the
detector (90◦.78) is very close to 90◦. Panels a and b of Fig. 5
show the MOS1 and MOS2 count numbers during the ﬂaring
period. Following Kraft et al. (1991) we denote this image N.
The horizontal row with no counts in the MOS1 image is due to
a bad row. Panels c and d of Fig. 5 show the MOS1 and MOS2
count numbers during the non-ﬂaring period, scaled-down to the
ﬂaring-period exposure using the exposure map ratios. This im-
age is our estimate of the mean count numbers during the non-
ﬂaring period. Following Kraft et al. (1991) we denote this image
B, as background. Panels e and f of Fig. 5 show the diﬀerence
between the previous panels, shown only for potential count ex-
cesses (N − B > 0). Following Kraft et al. (1991) we denote

low number of counts, hence we have to carefully determine the
conﬁdence limits of the observed count excesses to select only
pixels that exclude null values at the conﬁdence level CL.

Since the Bayesian method of Kraft et al. (1991) requires that
the background estimate is close to the true value (see also He-
lene 1983), we limit our statistical analysis to the pixels where
the count number during the non-ﬂaring period is larger or equal
to 20, in order to reduce the Poisson noise (see the boxed pixel

astrometry uncertainty of EPIC, which conﬁrms that the ﬂaring
emission detected on 2014 Mar. 10 came from Sgr A*.

3.1.3. Spectral analysis of the X-ray ﬂares

To analyze the spectrum of the two ﬂares seen by XMM-Newton
on 2014 Mar. 10 and 2014 Apr. 2, we extracted events from a cir-
cle of 10(cid:48)(cid:48) radius centered on the Sgr A* radio position, as we
did for the temporal analysis. The X-ray photons were selected
with PATTERN≤ 4 and FLAG==0 for the pn camera. We did not
work with photons from MOS1 and MOS2, because the num-
ber of events is too small to constrain the spectral properties.
The source+background time interval is the range between the
beginning and the end of the ﬂare computed by the Bayesian-
blocks algorithm (see Table 6). The background time interval is
the whole observation minus the time range during the ﬂare. We
also rejected 300s on either side of the ﬂare to avoid any bias.
This extraction is the same as used in Mossoux et al. (2015a).
We computed the spectrum, ancillary ﬁles, and response matri-
ces with the SAS task especget.

The model used to ﬁt the spectrum with XSPEC (version
12.8.1o) is the same as that in Mossoux et al. (2015a): an ab-
sorbed power law created using TBnew (Wilms et al. 2000) and
pegpwrlw with a dust scattering model from dustscat (Predehl &
Schmitt 1995). TBnew uses the cross-sections from Verner et al.
(1996). Interstellar medium abundances of Wilms et al. (2000)
imply a decrease of the column density by a factor of 1.5 (Nowak
et al. 2012). The extracted spectrum was grouped using the SAS
task specgroup. The spectral binning begins at 2 keV with a

CL = (cid:82) smax

5 Following Kraft et al. (1991), we ﬁrst determine the conﬁdence in-
terval [smin, smax] of S ≡ N − B at the conﬁdence level CL where,
for a count excess, smax is deﬁned as fN,B(smax) ≡ fN,B(smin) and
smin = 0, with fN,B(S ) ≡ exp(−(S +B)) (S +B)N/(N! ΣN
n=0exp(−B)Bn/n!)
is the posterior probability distribution function. We then compute
fN,B(s) ds and its Gaussian equivalent in units of σ given
by φ−1((1 − CL)/2), with φ−1 being the reciprocal of the cumulative
distribution function of the normal distribution.

minimum signal-to-noise ratio 6 of 4 and 3 for the ﬁrst and sec-
ond ﬂares, respectively. The number of net counts during the ﬁrst
ﬂare is 900 (see Table 6) and the number of spectral bins is 12.
This gives an average of about 75 counts in each spectral bin.
If we perform the same computation for the second ﬂare, which
has 180 net counts for 6 spectral bins, we have 31 counts per
spectral bin.

We used the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
to constrain the three parameters of the model: the hydrogen col-
umn density (NH), the photon index of the power law (Γ), and the
unabsorbed ﬂux between 2 and 10 keV (Funabs
2−10 keV). The MCMC
6 The equation computing the signal-to-noise ratio is the same as in
specgroup and in ISIS (Houck 2013). We therefore use the same
grouping as in Mossoux et al. (2015a).

makes a random walk of nstep steps in parameter space for sev-
eral walkers (nwalkers), which evolve simultaneously. The posi-
tion of each walker at a step in the parameter space is determined
by the positions of the walker at the previous step. Convergence
was achieved using the probability function of the parameters.
The resulting MCMC chain reports all these steps. This method
give us a complete view of the spectral parameters distribution
and correlation.

We use Jeremy Sanders’ XSPEC_emcee7 program that al-
lows MCMC analyses of X-ray spectra in XSPEC using emcee8
(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013), an extensible, pure Python im-
plementation of Goodman & Weare (2010)’s aﬃne invariant
MCMC ensemble sampler. We follow the operating mode ex-
plained in the XSPEC_emcee homepage to ﬁnd the optimal value
for the MCMC sampler parameters. Two criteria must be ful-
ﬁlled to have a good sampling in the chain: the chain length must
be greater than the autocorrelation time and the mean accep-
tance fraction must be between 0.2 and 0.5 (Foreman-Mackey
et al. 2013). We created a chain containing 30 walkers. The
Python function acor computes the auto-correlation time (τacor)
needed to have an independent sampling of the target density.
The burn-in period (nburn) and chain length (nstep) are deﬁned
as 20×τacor (Sokal 1997) and 30×nburn (Foreman-Mackey et al.
2013), respectively. For the spectral model used here, τacor =5.1
and 5.3 for the 2014 Mar. 10 and 2014 Apr. 2 ﬂares, respectively.
Thus we used nburn = 102, nwalkers = 30, and nstep = 3060
for the March 10 ﬂare and nburn = 106, nwalkers = 30, and
nstep = 3180 for the April 2 ﬂare. The mean acceptance frac-
tion is around 0.6 for the two ﬂares, which is a reliable value.

The diagonal plots in Fig. 6 are the marginal distribution of
each parameter (i.e., the probability to have a certain value of
one parameter independently from others). The other panels in
Fig. 6 represent the joint probability for each pair of parameters.

90% and 99% of the points (i.e., nwalkers × nstep). The best-ﬁt
parameter values are the median (i.e., 50th percentile) of each
parameter obtained from the marginal distribution. We also de-
ﬁne a 90% conﬁdence range for each parameter as the 5th and
95th percentile of the marginal distribution. These numbers are
reported in Table 7. The corresponding best spectrum is over-
plotted on the data in Fig. 7.

We can compare the spectral parameters of this ﬂare with
those of the two brightest ﬂares detected with XMM-Newton,
which have the better constrained spectral parameters thanks to
the high throughput and no pileup (Porquet et al. 2003, 2008).
Their spectral properties are reported in Table 7. The magnetar
has a soft spectrum, which implies that the soft part (0.5 − 3
keV) of the background is very high. Thus we have only one
spectral bin in this energy band (see Fig. 7), implying that the
hydrogen column density is not well constrained. The hydrogen
column density and the photon index of the two brightest ﬂares
are well within the 90% conﬁdence range of the 2014 Mar. 10
and 2014 Apr. 2 ﬂares even if the parameters of the latter are
less constrained than the former.
Assuming the typical spectral parameters of the X-ray bright
ﬂares, i.e., Γ = 2 and NH = 14.3×1022 cm−2 (Porquet et al. 2003,
2008; Nowak et al. 2012), we determined with XSPEC and the
pn response ﬁles in the 2–10 keV energy range an unabsorbed-
ﬂux-to-count-rate ratio of 4.41× 10−11 erg s−1 cm−2/pn count s−1
(corresponding to an absorbed-ﬂux-to-count-rate ratio of 2.01 ×
10−11 erg s−1 cm−2/pn count s−1). From the 8 kpc distance and
the total number of counts (Table 6), we determine a total en-
ergy of 30.4 ± 1.9 × 1037 and 6.0 ± 0.4 × 1037 ergs (1σ error)
for the 2014 Mar. 10 and Apr. 2 ﬂares, respectively. These val-
ues can be compared to ﬂares previously observed with Chan-
dra and XMM-Newton. Figure 8 shows the total energy of these
ﬂares versus the unabsorbed peak luminosity. Flare 1 is one of

computed using a 1σ-clipping method, are 59.3±0.7, 60.1±0.9,

The beginning and end of each ﬂare is set by the 1σ limit on
the ﬂux density whose maximum amplitude is larger than 3σ.
We only considered ﬂux-density increases that lasted longer than
25 s, in order to discard any calibration glitchs. All observed NIR
ﬂares are labeled with Roman numerals.
The ∼10 hour visit on 2014 Mar. 10 detected two NIR ﬂares.
The ﬁrst one (labeled I) peaks at 8.2σ and has an X-ray counter-
part. It lasts from 16:29:51 to 18:52:36 (1σ limit). We can see in
Table 6 that it begins and ends ∼ 14 min before the X-ray ﬂare.
As for the X-ray ﬂare, its shape is not a Gaussian, as it has a dip
during the third HST orbit. Two interpretations can be made to
explain this shape. First, this ﬂare could be a single ﬂare and the
variation from Gaussian shape during the third orbit can be seen
as substructures, as is the case for some NIR ﬂares (Dodds-Eden
et al. 2009). The second interpretation is that this NIR ﬂare is in
fact two distinct ﬂares with a return below the 1σ limit between
∼18:30 and ∼18:39. The time delay between the two maxima in
this scenario would be about 90 min. From 21:32:33 to 22:02:58
on 2014 Mar. 10, we can see that there is a second NIR ﬂare (la-
beled II), which has no X-ray counterpart. Its maximum is about
3.4σ.

On 2014 Apr. 2 we caught the end of a NIR ﬂare (labeled III),
lasting until 17:31:15. Its amplitude is larger than 8.8σ, since its
maximum occured during the Earth occultation of Sgr A*. Its
beginning could correspond with the small increase in ﬂux den-
sity seen just before the start of the Earth occultation of Sgr A*,
which would lead to an upper limit on its duration of 3360 s. The
duration of this NIR ﬂare III and its possible relation with X-ray
ﬂare 2 will be discussed in Sect. 4.

The amplitudes of these ﬂares can be compared to the sam-
ple of ﬂux densities from Sgr A* observed in the Ks-band with
NACO at ESO’s VLT and reported by Witzel et al. (2012).
They constructed a histogram of all ﬂux densities from the light
curves, without distinction between the quiescent and ﬂaring pe-
riods. This observed distribution of the ﬂux density has a rela-
tive maximum at 3.57 mJy. Below this amplitude the distribu-
tion decreases, because of the detection limit of NACO. Above
3.57 mJy, the distribution is highly asymmetric, with a rapid de-

cay of the frequency density followed by a long tail to 32 mJy.
Figure 10 compares the amplitude of the ﬂares detected with
HST during this campaign with the relative frequency density
given in Witzel et al. (2012, Fig. 3). The normalized distribu-
tion of the NIR ﬂux densities observed with NACO (top panel
of Fig. 10) is corrected for the background emission of 0.6 mJy
(Witzel et al. 2012). The amplitude of the ﬂares detected with
HST are extrapolated to the Ks-band using the H − L spectral
index of Sgr A* computed in Witzel et al. (2014b), which is
α = −0.62.

The detection threshold of HST, which we deﬁne as the 3σ
limit (dot-dashed line in Fig. 10), corresponds to 8% of the am-
plitude sample observed with NACO (bottom panel of Fig. 10).
The amplitude of NIR ﬂare II is about 7 times smaller than the
amplitude of the brightest ﬂare observed with NACO, whereas
the amplitude of ﬂare I is only 3 times smaller than the ampli-
tude of this event. We can only measure a lower limit on the
amplitude of NIR ﬂare III, since its maximum occured during
the Earth occultation. This lower limit is nearly as large as those
of ﬂare I.

3.3. VLT data

Fig. 11 shows the ratio between Sgr A* and S2 ﬂux densi-
ties for the observations where a NIR ﬂare was detected. Mak-
ing a very conservative estimation, the 3σ detection levels of
Sgr A* in the 2014 Apr. 3 and 4 data yield ﬂux density ratios
of F(Sgr A∗)/F(S2) ≈ 0.37 and 0.22, respectively (dash-dotted
lines of Fig. 11). A ﬂare (labeled IV) is observed on 2014 Apr.
3 with a peak amplitude of ∼ 3.9σ. We clearly see its rise and
decay phase below the 3σ detection level. On 2014 Apr. 4, a
smaller ﬂare (labeled V) is seen around 9:00 UT with a peak
amplitude of ∼ 5.1σ.
Using Eq. 2 of Witzel et al. (2012), with Ks(S2) = 14.13 ±
0.01 and A(Ks) = 2.46 ± 0.03 (Schödel et al. 2010), we have
F(S2) = 14.32 ± 0.26 mJy. The amplitude of the two NIR ﬂares
detected with SINFONI are thus 6.92± 0.13 and 5.30± 0.09 mJy
for 2014 Apr. 3 and 4, respectively. We consider that all the SIN-
FONI light curve variations above our 3σ detection limit can be
attributed to Sgr A* activity. We can therefore compare these
ﬂux densities with the sample of ﬂux densities observed with
NACO after the background subtraction of 0.6 mJy (Fig. 10).
The 2014 Apr. 3 and 4 ﬂares are within 4% of the largest ampli-
tude, and are 5 and 6 times smaller than the brightest amplitudes
observed with NACO, respectively. The 3σ detection level cor-

responds to 3.15 ± 0.06 mJy, which is comparable to the 11% of
the largest ﬂux density observed with NACO (Fig. 10).

3.4. CARMA data
The ﬂux densities at 95 GHz (3.2 mm) of Sgr A* and 1733-130
shown in Fig. 12 are computed for each 10 s integration on 2014
Apr. 2 and 3. On 2014 Apr. 2 the ﬂux density of Sgr A* increases
slowly. A bump is seen at 11.3 h, but it could not be associated
with the observed NIR or X-ray ﬂares, since the CARMA obser-
vation occurred before the ﬂares observed with HST and XMM-
Newton.

On 2014 Apr. 3 the ﬂux density decreases slowly, with two
bumps occuring at 12.4 and 13.6 h. The maximum of the NIR
ﬂare IV observed with VLT occurred at 7.9 h on the same date.
One of these episodes of radio ﬂux density variation could be
the delayed emission from this NIR ﬂare, which would indicate
a time delay of 4.4 or 5.6 h for the ﬁrst and second bumps, re-
spectively. The delays previously measured between the X-rays
and the 850 µm light curves range between 1.3 and 2.7 h (e.g.,
Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2006b, 2008; Marrone et al. 2008). Assuming
the expanding plasmon model, the delay between the NIR and
and the longer wavelength (3.2mm) emission must be larger than
these values, leading to a time delay consistent with those mea-
sured for these two bumps. One time-delay measurement was
made between the X-rays and the 7 mm light curve, leading to
a delay of about 5.3 h (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2009). This measure
seems to reject the second bump as being the delayed sub-mm
emission from the VLT ﬂare, since the delay is too long. The
ﬁrst bump, therefore, could be the delayed millimeter emission
of the NIR ﬂare IV. The second bump could then be the delayed
millimeter emission of a NIR ﬂare whose peak is lower than the
3σ detection level of VLT or which occurred after the end of the
VLT observation and during Earth occultation for HST.
The ﬂux density of Sgr A* during these observations in-
creases with frequency as S ν ∝ ν0.2. For comparison, previous
observations of Sgr A* between 43.3, 95.0, and 151 GHz (corre-
sponding to 7.0, 3.2, and 2.0 mm; Table 2 of Falcke et al. 1998)
give a similar spectra index of 0.58 ± 0.23.

3.5. VLA data
We obtained light curves of Sgr A* from all three days of VLA
observations, selecting (for the purpose of simpliﬁcation) only
one intermediate frequency channel with 30 s of averaging (anal-
ysis of the full radio dataset will be given elsewhere). In all ob-
servations we selected visibilities greater than 100 kλ in order to

minimize contamination from extended thermal emission from
Sgr A West. The radio light curves for the frequencies obtained
with the VLA in conﬁguration A on 2014 Mar.−Apr. are shown
in Fig. 13.

We interleaved the CARMA and VLA L- and C-band ob-
servations from 2014 Apr. 2 in order to search for a time de-
lay between the 1.68 GHz and 5.14 GHz, and the 1.68 GHz and
95 GHz light curves, using the z-transformed discrete correlation
function (ZDCF; Alexander 1997). The cross-correlation graphs
show no signiﬁcant maximum of the likelihood function, imply-
ing that we can not derive any time delay between these light
curves.

The light curves on 2014 Mar. 1 and Apr. 2 display a steady
decrease and increase of ﬂux density. The light curve on 2014
Mar. 10 shows an obvious break in its rising ﬂux density around
16 h, with a clear increase of the rising slope. To better con-
strain the time of this slope change, we ﬁt the VLA light curve
with a broken line. The break is located at 15.7 ± 0.2 h with a
slope increasing from 9.7 ± 0.1 to 27 ± 1 mJy h−1 (χ2
= 2828
with 508 d.o.f.), which is signiﬁcant. We therefore tentatively at-
tribute it to the onset of a radio ﬂare, since we have only partial
temporal coverage of this radio event. For comparison purposes,
the light curves of the 2014 Mar. 10 ﬂare observed with VLA,
WFC3, and XMM-Newton are shown in Fig 14.

red

The radio ﬂare observed at 13.37 GHz (2.2 cm) could be
the delayed emission from a NIR/X-ray ﬂare that occurred ei-
ther at the beginning of the observation with an amplitude lower
than the detection limits of WFC3 and XMM-Newton, or be-
fore the start of our HST and XMM-Newton observations. The
latter would imply a delay larger than 2.2h. As explained previ-
ously in Sect. 3.4, the largest time delay that has been measured
between X-ray and sub-mm ﬂares is 5.3 h (Yusef-Zadeh et al.
2009). Considering the expanding plasmon model (Yusef-Zadeh
et al. 2006a), the delay between the X-ray and centimeter light
curves must be larger than 5.3 h, and therefore the possibility of
a non-detected NIR/X-ray ﬂare is likely excluded.

4. Determination of the X-ray emission related to

the NIR ﬂares

In the following subsections we determine the X-ray emission
related to each NIR ﬂare observed with HST or VLT, with which
we associate either one of the X-ray ﬂares detected with XMM-
Newton or an upper limit on the amplitude of a non-detected
X-ray ﬂare.

The synchrotron−synchrotron process (SYN-SYN)
For synchrotron emission of NIR and X-ray photons by accel-
erated electrons in the ﬂaring region, the electron acceleration
has to be high enough to directly emit X-ray photons. It is diﬃ-
cult, however, to explain how to reach the required Lorentz fac-
tor of γ = 106 (Marrone et al. 2008; Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2012;
Eckart et al. 2012b). Moreover, the synchrotron cooling time
Eden et al. 2009) is very short for X-ray photons (≈ 1 s for
B = 100 G and ν = 4×1017 Hz). Thus, we must have continuous
injection of accelerated electrons to maintain the X-ray ﬂare dur-
ing the decay phase, which lasts ∼ 30 min. If the NIR and X-ray
ﬂares are created by the same population of electrons, whose en-
ergy distribution is described by a powerlaw as N(E) = K E−p,
the diﬀerence between the NIR and X-ray ﬂux can be explained
if the synchrotron spectrum has a cooling break frequency be-
tween the NIR and X-rays (Dodds-Eden et al. 2009). In this
scenario, the X-ray spectrum has a spectral index of α = p/2,
whereas the NIR spectral index is α = (p − 1)/2 (with S ν ∝ ν−α;
Dodds-Eden et al. 2009). Knowing that the X-ray photons are
produced by the electrons from the tail of the power law distri-
bution, during the ﬁrst part of the ﬂare there are many more elec-
trons that create NIR photons than those creating X-ray photons.
Then, the acceleration mechanism has to become more eﬃcient,
accelerating more electrons to the tail (and thus increasing p) of
the distribution and thus changing the ratio between the NIR and
the X-ray ﬂux. Hence the production of X-ray photons increases,
which explains the second part of the ﬂare.

gray error bars corresponds to the smoothed light curve of the X-ray

right y-axis. Bottom panel: The ﬂux of the X-ray light curve divided by

convert the X-ray count rate to ﬂux, we use the unabsorbed-ﬂux-
to-count-rate ratio derived in Section 3.1.3.

The NIR ﬂux of Sgr A* is obtained from the ﬂux density
S ν by integrating over the F153M ﬁlter, using the ﬁlter proﬁle
T (Spanish Virtual Observatory). To be consistent with the HST
photometric calibration (Vega system), we assume a Rayleigh-
Jeans regime (S ν ∝ ν2):

with νeﬀ the eﬀective frequency given by the Spanish Virtual Ob-

The ratio between the X-ray and NIR ﬂux during the ﬂare
is shown in Fig. 15 (the error bars are on the order of the sym-
bol size). The NIR ﬂux is always lower than the X-ray ﬂux, but
during the third orbit of the HST visit the X-ray contribution in-
creased by a factor of 10 compared to the NIR. We can test two
interpretations: a single ﬂare with non-simultaneous X-ray and
NIR peaks, or two distinct ﬂares with simultaneous NIR and X-
ray peaks.

4.1.1. A single ﬂare with non-simultaneous peaks in NIR and

X-rays

Considering that the NIR ﬂare is produced by synchrotron emis-
sion, there are three radiative processes that can explain the X-
ray ﬂare production: synchrotron (SYN; Dodds-Eden et al. 2009;
Barrière et al. 2014), inverse Compton (IC; Yusef-Zadeh et al.
2006b; Wardle 2011; Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2012), and synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC; Eckart et al. 2008) emission. In this section,
we discuss whether each process can explain the entire observed
NIR/X-ray light curve on 2014 Mar. 10.

The synchrotron−synchrotron self-Compton process (SYN-
SSC)
During synchrotron self-Compton emission, X-ray photons are
produced by the scattering of the synchrotron radiation from ra-
dio to NIR on their own electron population. If we compare the
ﬂuxes produced by the synchrotron and SSC emissions, the vari-
ation of the X-ray/NIR ratio constrains the size evolution of the
ﬂaring source. Let us consider a spherical source of radius R
with a power law energy distribution of relativistic electrons.
Following Van der Laan (1966), the radiative transfer for the syn-
chrotron radiation can be computed as

at each distance r from the sphere center as:

Assuming that we are in the optically thin regime (i.e., τν(r) <<

B(p+1)/2 ν−(p−1)/2 R3. For synchrotron radiation, we have B ∝

m with S m the maximum ﬂux density of the spectral
energy distribution occurring at frequency νm (Marscher 1983).
Finally, the synchrotron radiation can be expressed using p =

We therefore have three parameters that may vary during
the ﬂare to explain the increased ratio of X-ray and NIR ﬂux
(Fig. 15). Considering the plasmon model, for which a spheri-
cal source of relativistic electrons expands and cools adiabati-
cally, we have (Van der Laan 1966): νm ∝ R−(8α+10)/(2α+5) and
S m ∝ R−(14α+10)/(2α+5). Thus, S SSC/S SYN ∝ R−β with β ≡
(8α2 + (30 − 8 c2)α + 25 − 10 c2)/(2α + 5). We ﬁrst consider the
adiabatic expansion. For our observation, the ratio between the
X-ray and the NIR ﬂux increases during the 2014 Mar. 10 ﬂare,
implying that R−β must increase as the radius R increases. This
condition is satisﬁed if the exponent β is negative and thus if the
α value is lower than −2.5 or is between −2.3 and −1.25, which
is inconsistent because α must be positive. The expansion case is
thus likely to be rejected under the hypothesis of an optically thin
plasmon that expands adiabatically. We can also consider the
case where the plasmon is compressed during its motion through
a bottle-neck conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld. We can still use
the equations of Van der Laan (1966), since the conservation of
the magnetic ﬂux is explicitly taken into account. The compres-
sion case is thus preferred, because it allows positive values of α
for β > 5.4. Thus, for the SYN-SSC process, the plasmon must
be adiabatically compressed with at least S SSC/S SYN ∝ R−5.4.
Therefore, the observed increase of the X-ray-to-NIR ﬂux ratio
by a factor of 10 in 1.2 h implies a decrease of the radius by a fac-
tor of about 0.6. The average compression velocity is estimated
as Vcomp = ∆R/∆t, leading to |Vcomp|/c < 0.0034 R/Rs with Rs
the Schwarzschild radius (Rs = 1.2 × 1012 cm for Sgr A*, which
corresponds to 0.08 au). For comparison, the expansion veloc-
ities computed with this model in the literature range between
0.0028 and 0.15c (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2006a; Eckart et al. 2008;
Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2009), which is of the same order as the com-
pression velocity computed here. Thus, the model of an adiabatic
compression of a plasmon is the likely hypothesis to explain the
variation of the ratio between X-ray and NIR ﬂux, in the context
of the SYN-SSC process.

The synchrotron−inverse Compton process (SYN-IC)
In the case of inverse Compton emission, X-ray photons are pro-
duced by the scattering of either the NIR photons produced by
synchrotron emission from the thermal electron population asso-
ciated with the accretion ﬂow that produces the sub-millimeter
photons, or the sub-millimeter photons of the accretion ﬂow on
the electron population of the external source that produces the
NIR photons by synchrotron radiation.

For the former process, the accretion ﬂow is optically thin in
the NIR, allowing all of the thermal electron population of the
accretion ﬂow to upscatter the NIR photons. Yusef-Zadeh et al.
(2012) estimated the X-ray to NIR time delay for seven NIR/X-
ray ﬂares, which is due to upscattering of the NIR photons in the
accretion ﬂow. They identiﬁed a trend between increasing time
delay and the increase of the NIR/X-ray peak ratio that is con-
sistent with the SYN-IC process. The X-ray peak of ﬂare 1 is de-
ﬁned as the maximum of the pn smoothed light curve (Table 6).
We have only a lower limit on the NIR peak of ﬂare I, which
results in an estimated time delay of 25.5−73.9 min, because we
have an observational gap in the HST data. Figure 16 shows a
comparison of the peak ratio lower limit and time delay range of

Fig. 16. NIR/X-ray peak ratio vs. time delay for the synchrotron-inverse
Compton process. The asterisks are the results reported by Yusef-Zadeh
et al. (2012), the solid line is a parabolic ﬁt. The horizontal solid line
and gray box are the lower limit and error bar on the NIR/X-ray peak
ratio of the ﬂare I/1 on 2014 Mar. 10 and the corresponding time-delay
range. The dashed line is the ratio between the maximum NIR amplitude
reported by Witzel et al. (2012) and the X-ray peak of ﬂare 1, with the
gray box being the corresponding error bar (see text for details).

ﬂare I/1 (horizontal solid line) with those reported in Table 2 of
Yusef-Zadeh et al. (2012). This peak ratio lower limit is located
below the observed trend. Assuming that the actual NIR peak
can not be larger than the maximum observed amplitude (i.e.,
32 mJy; Witzel et al. 2012), the actual peak ratio (dashed line)
would be at least four times smaller than the value predicted by
the SYN-IC process. If the actual NIR peak corresponds to this
predicted value, this NIR ﬂare would be four times brighter than
the brightest ﬂare ever observed and its shape would be com-
pletely unusual. We therefore consider this process to be very
unlikely.

For the latter process, the accretion ﬂow is optically thick in
sub-millimeter, reducing the number of available sub-millimeter
photons produced by the thermal electron population to be up-
scattered (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2006b; Wardle 2011; Yusef-Zadeh
et al. 2012). If the sub-millimeter ﬂux of the accretion ﬂow is
constant, the X-ray ﬂare should have the same shape as the NIR
ﬂare. But in ﬂare I/1 the X-ray ﬂux increases while the NIR ﬂux
decreases. Since the decay of the NIR ﬂux can only be due to
the decrease of the number of accelerated electrons, the rise of
the X-ray ﬂux would require a simultaneous large increase of the
sub-millimeter ﬂux, which appears rather ﬁne tuned. Therefore,
we do not favor the SYN-IC process to explain the variation of
the NIR/X-ray ﬂux of ﬂare I/1.

4.1.2. Two distinct ﬂares with simultaneous NIR and X-ray

peaks

The 2014 Mar. 10 ﬂare could be decomposed into two ﬂaring
components (called Ia/1a and Ib/1b). Each NIR/X-ray ﬂaring
component is produced by its own population of accelerated
electrons. We introduce here a general model that will be used
in the next subsections to ﬁt the NIR and X-ray light curves. The
model is composed of a linear part (if needed), representing the
non-ﬂaring level, plus one or two Gaussian ﬂares:

2(cid:88)

F(t) = F0 + F1 (t − t0) +

Ai e−(t−ti)2/2 σ2
i ,

(7)

i=1

with Ai the amplitude above the non-ﬂaring level and ti and σi
the center and the standard deviation of each Gaussian. For the
X-rays, the non-ﬂaring level is ﬁxed to the Bayesian-block value.
The results of the ﬁt are given in Table 8 and the corresponding
light curves and residuals are shown in Fig. 17 (top panels).

Article number, page 15 of 26

A&A proofs: manuscript no. 27554_revised_printer_v9

The time of the ﬁrst and second peaks of the NIR and X-
ray ﬂares are consistent with each other within the 1σ errors.
Flare 1b appears broader in X-rays than in the NIR, but their
widths are consistent with each other within 1.5σ. The delay
time between the two X-ray maxima is about 5000 s, which is
longer than the time between two X-ray ﬂares observed during
the 2012 Chandra XVP campaign (about 4000 s; see Fig. 1 of
Neilsen et al. 2013). This argument, in addition to the change of
ﬂux ratio between the two ﬂares, favors the interpretation of two
distinct ﬂares.

From the unabsorbed-ﬂux-to-count-rate ratio derived in Sec-
tion 3.1.3, we compute the unabsorbed total energy of these
ﬂares using the total number of counts in each Gaussian. The
start and stop times of the ﬂares are deﬁned as the 3σ distance
from the time of the maximum, i.e., 16.0 and 17.6 h for ﬂare 1a,
and 17.4 and 19.8 h for ﬂare 1b. The unabsorbed total energy is
(12.7±6.7)×1037 and (21.2±6.5)×1037 ergs (1σ error) for ﬂares
1a and 1b, respectively. The unabsorbed total energy of ﬂare 1 is
thus split nearly equally between its two components. The peak
amplitude of ﬂare 1a is close to the smallest amplitudes of ﬂares
observed (Fig. 8).

4.2. The NIR ﬂare II on 2014 Mar. 10

This ﬂare is only detected in the NIR with HST. We therefore ﬁt
the NIR light curve with a single Gaussian above a constant non-
ﬂaring level using Eq. 7. The best ﬁt parameters are reported in
Table 8.

The upper limit on the amplitude of the undetected X-ray
counterpart was computed using the Bayesian method for the
determination of the conﬁdence limits described by Kraft et al.
(1991, see also Helene 1983). We use the notations and equations
of Sect. 3.1.2. We ﬁrst deﬁne a conﬁdence limit CL = 0.95 and
the source N as the number of counts during the time interval of
the ﬂare maximum (i.e., between ti − 3σ and ti + 3σ with σ the
error on ti reported in Table 8). The background B is the number
of counts in the non-ﬂaring Bayesian-block at the time of the
NIR ﬂare peak. We then determine smin and smax (see footnote
5 in Sect. 3.1.2) resolving the equation of CL. For ﬂare II, N =
62 counts and the non-ﬂaring level is deﬁned by the Bayesian
blocks as 0.315 counts s−1 between 21.65 and 21.71 h, leading to
B = 68 counts and S = −6 counts. Since S is negative, smin = 0,
leading to smax = 6. The upper limit on the amplitude is thus
0.028 counts s−1 at a conﬁdence level of 95%. The value of this
upper limit is also reported in Table 8.

4.3. The NIR ﬂare III on 2014 Apr. 2

We consider that two NIR ﬂares happened during the occulta-
tion of Sgr A* by the Earth. We thus ﬁt the NIR light curve with
two Gaussians (labeled IIIa and IIIb) above a linear component,
which is used here to take into account the change in the non-
ﬂaring level between the last two HST orbits (Eq. 7). The F-test
strongly supports two Gaussian components, since this signiﬁ-
canlty increases the goodness-of-ﬁt (p-value of 3 × 10−4). The
best-ﬁt parameters for the X-ray and NIR ﬂares are given in Ta-
ble 8 and the resulting graphs are shown in the bottom panels of
Fig. 17.

We then ﬁt the X-ray ﬂare 2 with a Gaussian above a quies-
cent level equal to the Bayesian-block value. The maximum of
the X-ray ﬂare has no time delay relative to the NIR ﬂare IIIa
above the 3σ error bars, as usually observed for X-ray ﬂares
with NIR counterparts (Eckart et al. 2006; Yusef-Zadeh et al.

2006a; Dodds-Eden et al. 2009). Moreover, the FHWM of the
NIR ﬂare IIIa (2458 s) is about 3 times larger than that of the
X-ray ﬂare (762 s), which is reminiscent of the FWHM ratio of
∼2 observed by Dodds-Eden et al. (2009) for the 2007 Apr. 4
NIR/X-ray ﬂare. The NIR ﬂare IIIa is thus probably the coun-
terpart of the X-ray ﬂare 2. This conclusion is based on our
Gaussian ﬁtting of ﬂare III, but a more complex shape cannot be
excluded due to the NIR observational gap. However, since the
X-ray ﬂare 2 and the previously observed NIR/X-ray ﬂares also

have a Gaussian shape (Eckart et al. 2006; Yusef-Zadeh et al.
2006a; Dodds-Eden et al. 2009), we consider that this conclu-
sion is the simplest and thus the most likely.

The amplitude of the ﬂare IIIb is one of the largest ob-
served when compared with the sample obtained with NACO
(Witzel et al. 2012). No X-ray counterpart is detected for this
ﬂare. We thus obtain an upper limit on the X-ray amplitude
using the same method as ﬂare II with N = 763 counts be-
tween 16.9 and 17.5 h. The background is deﬁned as the sum
of the number of counts in non-ﬂaring Bayesian-block values
(626.4 counts) and the number of counts in the Gaussian ﬁt of
ﬂare 2 during the maximum of the ﬂare (121.7 counts). We thus
have B = 748.1 counts, leading to S = 14.9 counts. The resulting
smin is 0, with smax = 65 counts. The upper limit on the ampli-
tude of the undetected X-ray counterpart is thus 0.030 counts s−1
at the conﬁdence level of 95%. This value is reported in Table 8.

4.4. The NIR ﬂare IV on 2014 Apr. 3

The VLT light curves consist of bins of 400 s exposures. The
number of bins is too small and the bin size too large to ﬁt a
Gaussian to the VLT light curves. We thus consider only the bin
with the largest ﬂux density as the peak of the ﬂare IV. This
value and the time of the maximum are reported in Table 8.

No X-ray counterpart is detected with XMM-Newton on
Apr. 3. We thus deduce an upper limit to the putative simultane-
ous X-ray ﬂare using the same method that was used for ﬂare II.
The time interval of the maximum of ﬂare IV is deﬁned as the
bin length of the light curve, i.e., 400 s centered on 7.89 h. The
number of counts in this interval is N = 127 counts and the
background is B = 119.1 counts, leading to S = 7.9 counts. The
resulting smin is 0, with smax = 17 counts, leading to an upper
limit on the amplitude of 0.042 counts s−1.

We have no XMM-Newton observation on 2014 Apr. 4.
However, as shown in Fig. 1, there is a simultaneous legacy
Chandra observation (ObsID: 16212; PI: D. Haggard) on this
date. We used the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations
(CIAO; version 4.6) to analyze these data. We worked with the
level=2 event list of the ACIS-S camera (Garmire et al. 2003),
available in the primary package of the Chandra archive. We ex-
tracted the source+background events in the 2−8 keV energy
range in a 1(cid:48)(cid:48).25-radius circle centered on the radio coordinates
of Sgr A* using the dmcopy task. We used the Bayesian-blocks
analysis with a false detection probability of e−3.5 to detect any
ﬂaring event. No X-ray counterpart to the NIR ﬂare was detected
during this observation. Based on N = 1 counts between 8.71
and 8.93 h and a non-ﬂaring level of 0.0065 counts s−1, we com-
pute B = 3 counts and S = −2 counts. The resulting smin is 0
with smax = 4 counts. The upper limit to the putative simulta-
neous X-ray amplitude is thus 0.01 counts s−1 at the conﬁdence
level of 95% (see ﬂare II for explanations).

5. Constraining the physical parameters of the

ﬂaring region

In this section we constrain the physical parameters of the ﬂar-
ing region by considering three radiative models for the NIR
and X-ray emission. After computing the NIR-to-X-ray simul-
taneous peak ratio sample detected during the 2014 campaign,
we investigated the synchrotron−synchrotron (SYN-SYN), syn-
chrotron Self-Compton−synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC-SSC),
and the synchrotron−synchrotron Self-Compton (SYN-SSC) ra-
diation mechanisms. These processes are called “local”, because
these emissions are produced only by the electrons accelerated in
the ﬂaring region. The last subsection is dedicated to the Inverse
Compton mechanism, which involves external electrons.

4.5. The NIR ﬂare V on 2014 Apr. 4

For ﬂare IV, we do not ﬁt the light curve with a Gaussian and we
consider the maximum of the light curve as the peak ﬂux density
of the NIR ﬂare (Table 8).

5.1. The sample of NIR ﬂares and the corresponding X-ray

emission

We compute the ﬂux densities of the NIR and X-ray ﬂare peaks
to constrain the physical parameters of the ﬂaring region needed

emission processes are lower than 10%. For example, the SYN-
SYN case is dominant if both SSC contribution for NIR and X-
rays are lower than 10% of the synchrotron contribution. Con-
sidering diﬀerent values for the turnover frequency (νm), which
deﬁnes the frequency at which the source becomes optically thin,
we have four free physical parameters for each value of the spec-
tral index (α): the size of the emitting region (θ), peak ﬂux den-
sity at νm (S m), number density of relativistic particles (ρ), and
the magnetic ﬁeld (B). The spectral index is given by the ratio
between the NIR and X-ray amplitudes for the SYN-SYN and
SSC-SSC cases, and by seven diﬀerent values of α from 0.3 to
1.5 for the SYN-SSC case. Computing the SYN or SSC ﬂux
density with the equations given by Eckart et al. (2012b), we
can constrain the values of the four physical parameters for each
value of α and νm.

The resulting graphs for the ﬂares detected in NIR and X-
rays (labeled Ia/1a, Ib/1b and IIIa/2) are shown in Fig. 19. Each
line corresponds to one value of α. The red dots are the turnover
frequencies from 50 to 3000 GHz in steps of 200 GHz. The con-
straint on the MIR amplitude limit observed during the bright
L(cid:48)-band and X-ray ﬂare on 2007 Apr. 4 of 57 mJy at 11.88 µm
(Dodds-Eden et al. 2009) is also used: the lines are dashed if this
limit is exceeded. This happens only for the SYN-SSC emission
mechanism and for high values of α.

The physical parameters are more constrained for ﬂare IIIa/2,
since the X-ray-to-NIR amplitude ratio is high. For this ﬂare,
the SYN-SSC emission mechanism leads to a size of 0.03−7
times the Schwarzschild radius and an electron density of 108.5–
1010.2 cm−3 for a synchrotron spectral-index of 0.3−1.5.

From the magnetic ﬁeld values deduced for these ﬂares, one
can infer the presence of sustained heating during the decay
phase of the X-ray or NIR ﬂares for the SYN-SYN and SYN-
SSC case. Indeed, if the synchrotron cooling timescale, deﬁned
as τsync = 8 (B/30 G)−3/2 (ν/1014 Hz)−1/2 min (Dodds-Eden et al.
2009), is shorter than the duration of the decay phase then sus-
tained heating is needed. We deﬁne the decay phase from the
time of the maximum of the Gaussian ﬁt (see Table 8) to the time
leading to 10% of the ﬂare amplitude (corresponding to 2.1σ af-
ter the maximum) in order to still have a detectable emission of
the ﬂare.

For the SYN-SYN case, the synchrotron cooling timescale
is shorter for the X-ray photons, leading to more constraints on
the presence of sustained heating. We thus consider the X-ray
frequency (ν = 1018 Hz) in the computation of the synchrotron
cooling timescale. The synchrotron cooling timescale is shorter
than the decay time of ﬂare 2 (695 s) for B larger than 1 G, im-
plying that sustained heating must be present during the decay
phase for these values of magnetic ﬁeld. A sustained heating is
always needed for ﬂares Ia/1a and Ia/1b, since they have a min-
imum value of the magnetic ﬁeld and a decay time larger than
those of ﬂare 2 (2318 and 2781 s, respectively).

For the SYN-SSC case, we consider the NIR frequency (ν =
1014 Hz) in τsync that we have to compare to the decay time of the
NIR ﬂares. Sustained heating is now needed for ﬂare IIIa (whose
decay time is 2240 s) with a magnetic ﬁeld of greater than 11 G,
corresponding to an electron density larger than 1010.1 cm−3. For
ﬂares Ia and Ib (whose decay times are 1545 and 3785 s, re-
spectively), sustained heating is needed for magnetic ﬁelds larger
than 13 and 7 G, respectively. The corresponding electron den-
sity is thus larger than 108.4 and 109.5 cm−3.

We also apply the study of Eckart et al. (2012b) to constrain
the physical parameters of the ﬂaring emission for the NIR ﬂares
that have no detected X-ray counterpart (ﬂares II, IIIb, IV and
V). The resulting graphs are shown in Fig. 20. The necessary

to produce such ﬂuxes. We extrapolate the amplitude of each
NIR peak to the Ks-band using the H−L spectral index computed
in Witzel et al. (2014b). The ﬂux density of the X-ray ﬂare peaks
is computed from the spectral ﬁtting in ISIS, using the typical
spectral parameters of the X-ray bright ﬂares (see Sect. 3.1.3).
The resulting conversion factor is 1 pn count s−1=3.935 µJy at
4 keV. The NIR peak ﬂux density and corresponding values of
the X-ray peaks (or upper limits) are reported in Table 8.

Figure 18 shows the NIR-to-X-ray peak ratio as a function
of the amplitude of the NIR ﬂares observed during the 2014
campaign. The unabsorbed X-ray peak luminosities are com-
puted using the conversion factor reported in Sect. 3.1.3. The
X-ray upper limit of NIR ﬂare V was obtained from Chandra
data. The corresponding unabsorbed-ﬂux-to-count-rate ratio of
1.97× 10−10 erg s−1 cm−2/count s−1 was computed with the same
spectral parameters as for XMM-Newton.

We also show the ﬂares reported by Eckart et al. (2012b),
the two simultaneous ﬂares on 2007 Apr. 4 (Porquet et al. 2008;
Nowak et al. 2012) labeled D and E in Table 2 of Trap et al.
(2011), and the delayed ﬂares of 2004 Jul. 7, 2008 Jul. 26+27,
and 2008 May 5 reported in Table 2 of Yusef-Zadeh et al. (2012).
The ﬂare Ia/1a lies within the bulk of NIR ﬂare amplitudes
and peak ratio, whereas the ﬂare IIIa/2 has the lowest NIR-to-X-
ray ratio ever observed. The NIR ﬂare IIIb is amongst the largest
NIR ﬂares (e.g., Dodds-Eden et al. 2009; Witzel et al. 2012) and
has the largest NIR-to-X-ray ratio ever observed.

5.2. Investigation of the local radiative processes

With the peak ﬂux density of the ﬂares in X-rays and NIR, we
use the formalism developed by Eckart et al. (2012b) to con-
strain the range of four physical parameters of the ﬂaring emis-
sion: the size of the source region, the magnetic ﬁeld, the den-
sity, and the maximum of the ﬂux density spectrum. Eckart et al.
(2012b) considered three cases, invoking the two radiative pro-
cesses, implying the local electrons from the ﬂaring source re-
gion: the SYN-SYN, SSC-SSC, and SYN-SSC emissions. A ra-
diative process is considered as dominant when the alternative

Compton−Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC-SSC), Synchrotron−Synchrotron Self-Compton (SYN-SSC) and Synchrotron-Synchrotron (SYN-
SYN) are dominant are shown in black, blue and green, respectively. The red dots represent the turnover frequencies from 50 to 3000 GHz by
step of 200 GHz. The arrows show the direction of the curves if the limit on the alternative emission processes is lowered. Dotted lines are locii of

electron density and magnetic ﬁeld ranges lie within lower val-
ues compared to those needed to produce detectable X-ray ﬂares,
since the eﬃciency of the production of X-ray photons is smaller.
Moreover, for ﬂare IIIb, the SYN−SYN process is only dominant
for small values of νm. This is explained by the small X-ray-to-
NIR amplitude ratio, since at large νm the synchrotron process
is too eﬃcient for the production of a small number of X-ray
photons.

We can also deduce the presence of sustained heating dur-
ing the decay phase of NIR ﬂares II and IIIb for the SYN-SYN

and SYN-SSC case. The synchrotron cooling timescale is shorter
than the decay time of ﬂare II (772 s) if B is larger than 22 G, re-
quiring sustained heating during the decay phase for these values
of magnetic ﬁeld. For ﬂare IIIb (whose decay times are 695 s),
sustained heating is required for B larger than 1 G.

However, as argued by Eckart et al. (2012a), alternative mod-
els such as diﬀerent spectral indexes for the NIR and X-ray, due
to inhomogeneities of the accretion disk, can also explain the
data with larger numbers of free parameters.

5.3. Investigation of the external radiative process
As reported in Sect. 4.1.1, Yusef-Zadeh et al. (2012) investigated
the upscattering of the NIR photons produced in the ﬂaring re-
gion on electrons of the accretion ﬂow. The ratio between the
Inverse Compton and the synchrotron emission is

with Uph the photon energy density and UB = B2/8π the mag-
netic energy density. Given the variation of B with the distance
from Sgr A* (B = B0 (r/Rs)−1 with B0 of several hundred of
Gauss; Eatough et al. 2013), it is possible to create NIR and X-
ray ﬂares with a large range of NIR-to-X-ray ratio. Thus, we
cannot identify the IC radiation by only considering the NIR-to-
X-ray ratio.

However, using the estimation of the time delay between X-
ray and NIR ﬂare peaks as a function of the NIR-to-X-ray peak
ratio reported in Yusef-Zadeh et al. (2012) and shown in Fig. 16,
we can estimate the time delays that we would observe during
our 2014 campaign. For the detected X-ray ﬂares, the NIR-to-
X-ray peak ratio ranges between 6 and 45 mJy/1035 erg s−1 (see
Fig. 18) leading to a time delay less than 10 min, which is smaller
than the error bars on the time of the maximum of the Gaussians.
The IC emission, therefore, is still a possible radiative process
for the production of the X-ray ﬂares observed during this cam-
paign.
For the undetected X-ray ﬂares II, IIIb, IV and V, the NIR-
to-X-ray ratio is larger than 32, 269, 48, and 55 mJy/1035 erg s−1,
respectively. The corresponding time delays are thus greater than
9, 26, 11, and 12 min, respectively. These time delays are larger
than the events with detected X-ray ﬂares. The eﬃciency of the
ﬂare detection with XMM-Newton and Chandra, however, does
not allow us to detect such faint X-ray ﬂares, which may have
the largest delay in the inverse Compton framework.

Thus, the ﬂares observed during the 2014 campaign leave
the IC process as a possible emission mechanism for producing
X-ray ﬂares from the NIR photons.

6. Discussing the X-ray ﬂaring rate
We can compare the X-ray ﬂare frequency during our observa-
tions (three ﬂares over 255.644 ks) to the one derived from the
Chandra XVP campaign in 2012: 45 ﬂares detected by Bayesian-
block algorithm over 2983.93 ks (1.5 ﬂare per day). Consider-
ing a sample of 45 ﬂares having the same amplitude and du-
ration distribution as those observed during the Chandra XVP
campaign superimposed on the non-ﬂaring level observed with
XMM-Newton during our campaign, the Bayesian-blocks algo-
rithm detects 36 ﬂares over 2983.93 ks. If we sum the number of
ﬂares that we can detect during the exposure time corresponding
to each observation during the XMM-Newton 2014 campaign,
we arrive at a prediction of 3.1 ﬂares during this campaign. We
compare the ﬂare rate observed during the Chandra XVP cam-
paign to those observed during this campaign (36 ﬂares over
2983.93 ks and 3 ﬂares over 255.644 ks), assuming a Poisson
process (Gehrels 1986; Fay 2010). The p-value for the null hy-
pothesis that the ﬂaring rate we have to observe and the rate we
currently observe is the same, is 1, which implies that the ﬂar-
ing rate observed close to the pericenter passage of the DSO/G2
is consistent with that observed during the Chandra XVP cam-
paign. The conclusion is the same if we consider only two X-ray
ﬂares instead of three (p-value=0.54). To conclude that the mea-
sured ﬂaring rate is statistically diﬀerent from those observed

during the Chandra XVP campaign, we would have to detect at
least 8 ﬂares during our campaign (p-value=0.04), which corre-
sponds to an increase of the ﬂaring rate by a factor of 2.6 (95%
conﬁdence interval of 1.0 − 5.7).

Since the beginning of the observation of Sgr A* in X-rays,
two temporary episodes of higher ﬂaring rate were observed
(Porquet et al. 2008; Neilsen et al. 2013). Porquet et al. (2008)
detected four ﬂares on 2007 Apr. 04 with XMM-Newton. Three
of these ﬂares happened during the last 39.6 ks of the observa-
tion, corresponding to a ﬂaring rate of 8.8 ﬂares per day. We
can compare this ﬂaring rate to the 38 ﬂares that should be
detected by the Bayesian-block algorithm. The ratio between
the two rates is 5 and the 95% conﬁdence interval is 1.3−20
(p-value=0.03). Neilsen et al. (2013) detected 4 ﬂares during
23.6 ks with Chandra, which corresponds to a ﬂaring rate of
14.6 ﬂares per day. We can directly compare this ﬂaring rate to
that computed during the 2012 Chandra XVP campaign if we re-
move these 4 ﬂares from the sample of 45 ﬂares detected by the
Bayesian-blocks algorithm. Thus, we have to compare 41 ﬂares
over 2960.33 ks and 4 ﬂares over 23.6 ks. The ratio between the
two rates is 13 and the 95% conﬁdence interval is 3.3−33.3 (p-
value=9 × 10−4). This implies that some temporary increase of
Sgr A* activity in X-ray may have been observed without an in-
crease of the quiescent level due to an increase of the accretion
rate.

The radio monitoring of Sgr A* with VLA between 2012 and
2014 May showed no change in the ﬂux density or the spectrum
(Bower et al. 2015a; Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2015). Observations of
Sgr A* after the DSO/G2 pericenter passage show that there is
no increase of the ﬂaring activity in radio/sub-mm (Tsuboi et al.
2015; Park et al. 2015). The 2014 Feb.−June Chandra X-ray
monitoring of Sgr A* shows no rise of the quiescent ﬂux (Hag-
gard et al. 2014). The compactness of the object can explain the
absence of any increase in the Sgr A* accretion rate during peri-
center passage at 2014.39± 0.14 (Valencia-S. et al. 2015), which
corresponds to 2014 Apr. 20 (2014 Mar. 1−2014 Jun. 10). Five
ﬂares with an absorbed ﬂuence greater than 5 × 10−9 erg cm−2
(corresponding to an unabsorbed ﬂuence of 10.9×10−9 erg cm−2
when using Γ = 2 and NH = 14.3 × 1022 cm−2) were observed
with XMM-Newton and Chandra between 2014 Aug. 30 and
Oct. 20, implying an increase in the rate of energetic ﬂares, but
the overall ﬂaring rate did not change (Ponti et al. 2015).

To assess the typical timescale for the accretion of fresh mat-
ter from the DSO/G2 object onto Sgr A* at pericenter, we com-
pute the disk accretion timescale (τacc) for Sgr A*. It is governed
by the viscous timescale, which is computed for an ADAF us-
ing the self-similar solution derived by Yuan & Narayan (2014,
and references therein). At the distance r of the SMBH, τacc is
deﬁned as r/Vrad with Vrad the radial velocity for the self-similar
solution, which gives us: τacc ∼ 3.0 (r/2000Rs)1.5 (α/0.1)−1 yrs
with α ∈ [0, 1] the eﬃciency of the mechanism of angular mo-
mentum transport introduced by Shakura & Sunyaev (1973).
For a pericenter distance of about 2000 Rs (Pfuhl et al. 2015;
Valencia-S. et al. 2015) and α = 0.1, we should not see any in-
crease of the ﬂux from Sgr A* before 2017. Moreover, the large
angular momentum of the gas and dust from DSO/G2 likely in-
creases the true accretion timescale.

Some numerical simulations of the accretion of gas in a
RIAF model were made, leading to a time range for the gas ac-
cretion of some months to several ten of years after the pericenter
passage (Burkert et al. 2012; Schartmann et al. 2012). However,
these simulations modeled DSO/G2 as a gas cloud or a spherical
shell of gas, but not as a young star with circumstellar material.
The accretion time when there is no central star may thus be

Article number, page 21 of 26

A&A proofs: manuscript no. 27554_revised_printer_v9

lower than τacc, since the gas cloud is partially tidally disrupted
before the pericenter passage.

Zajaˇcek et al. (2014) modeled the DSO/G2 as an interme-
diate mass star of 2 M(cid:12) moving in a RIAF. They studied the
tidal eﬀects on a circumstellar dusty envelope and on a circum-
stellar accretion disk. They showed that if the test particles are
distributed in a disk-like structure, the number of particles that
remain gravitationally bound to the star after the pericenter pas-
sage is larger than that for a spherical distribution of particles.
From their Fig. 13, we can also infer that the accretion onto
Sgr A* begins earlier for a spherical distribution than for a disk-
like model. However, in these simulations, no circumstellar gas
was taken into account.

7. Conclusions
The pericenter passage of the DSO/G2 object at the beginning of
2014 was predicted to produce an increase of the ﬂaring activity
of Sgr A* in several wavelengths. This 2014 Feb.−Apr. cam-
paign was designed to follow an increase of its ﬂaring activity
simultaneously in X-rays, NIR, and radio/sub-mm.

Three NIR ﬂares were detected with WFC3 on board HST:
two on 2014 Mar. 10 (I and II) and one on Apr. 2 (III). Two ad-
ditional NIR ﬂares were detected with SINFONI at ESO’s VLT
on 2014 Apr. 3 (IV) and 4 (V). All of these NIR ﬂares are within
the top 8% of the largest amplitude ﬂares observed with NACO
at ESO’s VLT (Witzel et al. 2012). Since the detection limit of
WFC3 and SINFONI correspond to the 8 and 11% amplitude
levels of this sample, the fact that the observed NIR ﬂares belong
to the most luminous NIR ﬂares is statistically expected and can
not be taken as any indication for an increase of NIR activity.

Two X-ray ﬂares were detected on 2014 Mar. 10 (1) and Apr.
2 (2) using the Bayesian-blocks method on the XMM-Newton
observations. The spectral parameters of these X-ray ﬂares ﬁt-
ted with the MCMC method are consistent with those of the
two brightest ﬂares detected with XMM-Newton (Porquet et al.
2003, 2008).

The ﬂare I/1 observed on 2014 Mar. 10 presents a change in
the NIR to X-ray ﬂux ratio, with an increase of the X-ray ﬂux
contribution during the second half of the ﬂare. We tested the
three radiative processes that can explain the NIR/X-ray ﬂares
from Sgr A* as a single ﬂare, considering energetic arguments.
The most likely interpretation is that the NIR and X-ray pho-
tons are produced in a plasmon in adiabatic compression by syn-
chrotron and SSC emission mechanisms, respectively. However,
the ﬂares I and 1 can also be decomposed into two Gaussian
ﬂares with a time separation of only 1.2 h. We can thus asso-
ciate the NIR ﬂares Ia and Ib to the X-ray ﬂares 1a and 1b, re-
spectively. They reproduce the characteristics observed in other
simultaneous NIR/X-ray ﬂares, i.e., no apparent delay between
the maxima and a similar FWHM. The ﬂares Ia/1a lie within the
bulk of NIR ﬂare amplitudes and peak ratio, but the ﬂare Ib/1b
lies within the lowest peak ratio ever observed.

The NIR ﬂare III is actually composed of two close Gaus-
sian ﬂares (IIIa and IIIb). The X-ray ﬂare 2 is the counterpart
of the NIR ﬂare IIIa. It has the lowest NIR-to-X-ray ratio ever
observed.

The NIR ﬂares II, IIIb, IV, and V have no detectable X-
ray counterpart in our XMM-Newton observation or the legacy
Chandra observation. The upper limits on the X-ray amplitude
were computed using the Bayesian method for the determination
of the conﬁdence limits described by Helene (1983) and Kraft
et al. (1991). The ﬂare IIIb lies within the largest NIR ﬂuxes

Article number, page 22 of 26

(e.g., Dodds-Eden et al. 2009; Witzel et al. 2012) and has the
largest NIR-to-X-ray ratio ever observed.

In total, we detected seven NIR ﬂares and three X-ray ﬂares

during the 2014 campaign.

On 2014 Mar. 10 we also identiﬁed an increase in the rising
radio ﬂux density at 13.37 GHz with the VLA, which could be
the delayed radio emission from a NIR/X-ray ﬂare that occurred
before the start of our observation.

On 2014 Apr. 2 we identiﬁed a bump of the ﬂux density on
the rising 3.2-mm light curve observed with CARMA. The time
range of this observation does not allow us to associate this mil-
limeter bump to a NIR/X-ray ﬂare. Moreover, we found no sig-
niﬁcant delay between the CARMA light curve and VLA L− and
C−band data.

On 2014 Apr. 3 two millimeter ﬂares were identiﬁed above
the decaying 3.2-mm light curve. The former could be the de-
layed emission of the NIR ﬂare IV.

We derived physical parameters of the ﬂaring emission for
local radiative processes, as done previously by Eckart et al.
(2012b), for each NIR/X-ray ﬂare, and also for NIR ﬂares
with no detected X-ray counterpart. Physical parameters for
the ﬂare IIIa/2 are better constrained when asssuming syn-
chrotron and SSC emission mechanisms for the NIR and X-
ray ﬂares, respectively. This ﬂaring region has a size of 0.03−7
times the Schwarzschild radius and an electron density of 108.5–
1010.2 cm−3, for a synchrotron spectral-index of 0.3−1.5. The de-
rived physical parameters of the ﬂaring emission associated with
the undetected X-ray counterpart are poorly constrained, since
the X-ray photon production eﬃciency is smaller.

We also tested the SYN-IC process using the NIR-to-X-ray
peak amplitude ratio and the predicted time delay between the
NIR and X-ray peaks. This external radiative process is also a
possible emission model for the emission of the ﬂares observed
during this campaign.

No signiﬁcant increase in the X-ray ﬂaring rate has been
detected during this campaign, but continuous monitoring of
Sgr A* is still important to detect any steady increase of its
ﬂaring activity that could be due to accreting material from the
DSO/G2. This may put some constrains on the physical proper-
ties of the G2 object and the ambient medium inside the Bondi
radius of this SMBH.

Appendix A: The magnetar impact on the ﬂare

detection efﬁciency

The contamination of the non-ﬂaring level of Sgr A* by the
Galactic center magnetar implies a decrease of the detection
level of the faintest and shortest ﬂares. To assess the impact on
our ﬂare detection eﬃciency, we examine the ﬂare detection rate
(Fig. B.1. of Mossoux et al. 2015a) versus the ﬂare peak signif-
icance, i.e., the amplitude of the ﬂare expressed in units of the
standard deviation of the non-ﬂaring level. This scaling allows
the comparison of observations with diﬀerent non-ﬂaring lev-
els. The ﬂares used in these simulations have a Gaussian shape
whose the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) corresponds
to the shortest, mean, and longest duration ﬂares observed during
the Chandra XVP campaign of 2012 (Neilsen et al. 2013). In Fig.

we randomly select 100 sets of 45 ﬂares following the am-
plitudes and durations distribution given by Neilsen et al.
(2013), i.e, dN/dCRCh = 0.7 CR−1.9
Ch e−CRCh/0.3 and dN/dT =
0.05T−0.1e−T/3000 with CRCh the peak count rate as observed
by Chandra and T the ﬂare duration9. In order to convert the
Chandra count rate to the XMM-Newton count rate (CRXMM),
we can use the relation derived in Mossoux et al. (2015a) be-
tween the Chandra HETG count rate (zero and ﬁrst order) of
the ﬂare peak and the unabsorbed luminosity at the peak ﬂare,
2−10 keV/1034 erg s−1 = −0.031 + 136.7CRCh. This unab-
i.e., Lunabs
sorbed luminosity is obtained with the spectral index Γ = 2
and the hydrogen column density NH = 14.3 × 1022 cm−2
(Neilsen et al. 2013). We determine with the arf and rmf ﬁles
of pn a count rate to unabsorbed luminosity ratio of 2.96 ×
10−36 pn count s−1/erg s−1. We can thus convert the Chandra
count rate to the pn count rate assuming the same spectral pa-
rameters. Since each ﬂare can be associated to a detection prob-
ability between 0 and 1, the sum of the probability for the 45
ﬂares give us the total number of ﬂares that can be detected in
average by the Bayesian-blocks method during a pn observation
with an exposure time of 2.98393 × 106 s. The distribution of
the ﬂare duration and amplitude seen during the Chandra XVP
campaign and the detection probability of the Bayesian-blocks
algorithm is shown in Fig A.2. The left and right panels if this
ﬁgure represents the detection probability corresponding to the
mean non-ﬂaring level seen by XMM-Newton during the 2011
campaign and to those observed during the 2014 Feb. 28 obser-
vation, respectively.

The mean of the number of detected ﬂares for the 100 sets
shows that considering the non-ﬂaring level of the 2011 cam-
paign, we can detect 85.4% of the ﬂares detected during the
Chandra XVP campaign. The non-detected ﬂares are the faintest
and shortest ones. For the 2014 Feb. 28, Mar. 10, Apr. 2 and Apr.
3, we detect 79.2%, 79.4%, 80.1% and 79.8% of the ﬂares de-
tected during the Chandra XVP campaign, respectively. There-
fore, we estimate that we missed about 20.4% of the ﬂares from
Sgr A*. Since we detected three ﬂares this means that we lost no
more than one ﬂare.

Appendix B: Filtering out of the magnetar pulsed

emission

To ﬁlter out the magnetar contamination, we ﬁrst computed the
period (P) and period ( ˙P) derivative of SGR J1745-29 by folding
the light curve of all XMM-Newton observations of this cam-
paign in which gaps between observations, GTI and exposure
correction were taken into account. The relation between events
arrival times t in the barycentric referential (computed using the
SAS task barycen) and the magnetar phase can be written as a
Taylor series on the time:

φ(t) = φ0 +

t − t0
P

− 0.5

(t − t0)2

P2

˙P ,

(B.1)

with t0 the start time of the ﬁrst XMM-Newton observation and
φ0 an arbitrary phase. We choose φ0 in order to have the maxi-
mum of the pulse at φ = 0.5. A χ2 ﬁtting with a constant function
was applied on the folded light curve. The maximum χ2 give

9 The cutoﬀ value is given as a lower limit in Neilsen et al. (2013) but
the speciﬁc value does not inﬂuence the result of our ﬂare distribution
because we are interested by ﬂares characterized by small amplitude
and short duration since these ﬂares may suﬀer of the small detection
rate.

Fig. A.1. Comparison of the ﬂare detection level with the non-ﬂaring
level corresponding to those of the 2011 (left panel) and February 2014
(right panel) observations. The vertical doted-dashed line represents an
example ﬂare with the same amplitude above the non-ﬂaring level for a
2011 and 2014 Feb.−Apr. observations.

Fig. A.2. Flare distribution seen by Chandra and the detection probabil-
ity of the Bayesian-blocks algorithm during an observation with XMM-
Newton. The crosses are the X-ray ﬂares detected during the Chandra
XVP campaign of 2012. Left panel: The ﬂare amplitude above the non-
ﬂaring level seen by EPIC/pn during the 2011 campaign. Right panel:
The ﬂare amplitude above the non-ﬂaring level seen by EPIC/pn during
the 2014 Feb. 28 observation.

A.1, we show the ﬂare detection rate for the 2011 (left panel) and
2014 Feb. 28 (right panel) non-ﬂaring levels for a false detection
probability of p1 = exp(−3.5).

We can see that because the non-ﬂaring level in the 2014
Feb. 28 light curve has increased by a factor of about three by
comparison with the 2011 campaign, the standard deviation is
3. For example, if we consider
increased by a factor of about
a ﬂare with an amplitude of 0.2 count s−1 above the non-ﬂaring
level, this corresponds to a peak signiﬁcance of 6.3σ for the 2011
light curves and this Gaussian shape ﬂare is always detected if
its duration is ∼ 320 s (FWHM). A ﬂare with the same amplitude
in the 2014 Feb. 28 light curve corresponds to 3.2σ and is only
detected with a probability of 53%.

√

In order to assess how many ﬂares we cannot detect due to
the magnetar contamination, we create a trial sample of ﬂares
following the duration and amplitude distribution determined
during the Chandra XVP campaign of 2012 (Neilsen et al. 2013).
We ﬁrst compute a grid of 30 ﬂare amplitudes and 30 ﬂare du-
rations in the range [0.06 − 0.4] count s−1 and [337.5 − 8100] s,
respectively, regularly distributed in the logarithmic scale. For
each point of the grid, we create 300 Gaussian ﬂares charac-
terized by the corresponding amplitude and duration (which is
two times the standard deviation of the Gaussian). We then ap-
ply the Bayesian blocks algorithm on all these ﬂares superim-
posed above a non-ﬂaring level corresponding to those of the
2011 XMM-Newton campaign seen with pn and each 2014 pn
observation. By computing how many ﬂares are detected among
the 300 simulated ﬂares, we estimate the probability to detect a
ﬂare with a certain amplitude and duration.

Because Neilsen et al. (2013) detect 45 ﬂares during a
total time of 2983.93 ks using the Bayesian-blocks method,

from Eq. B.1. Thus we can construct a new GTI ﬁle which is the
combination of the GTI ﬁle from the event list of pn (which con-
tains the time interval during which the cameras do not observe)
and the GTI ﬁle created by removing the magnetar pulse using
the SAS task gtimerge.

Appendix C: The two X-ray ﬂares seen in EPIC/pn,

MOS1 and MOS2 cameras

Figures C.1 shows the ﬂare light curves obtained with EPIC on
board XMM-Newton on 2014 Mar. 10 (left panels) and Apr. 2
(right panels). The Bayesian-blocks algorithm characterizes the
2014 Mar. 10 ﬂare with two blocks in the pn light curve but only
with one block in the MOS1 and MOS2 light curves. Moreover,
the duration of the ﬂares seen in each camera is diﬀerent (see
Table C.1). This can be explained by the lower number counts in
MOS1 and MOS2 because of the RGS: the number of photons
recorded by pn during the ﬂare is larger and thus the accuracy on
the determination of the beginning and end of the ﬂare is better.
The ﬂare on 2014 Apr. 2 is not detected by the Bayesian-
blocks algorithm in MOS1 and MOS2 because the amplitude
and the number of counts in this ﬂare is rather small.

ing 1-σ errors which are reported on Table B.1. The conﬁdence
level of the χ2 distribution for these two parameters is given in
Fig. B.2 (left panel). A comparison with the parameters derived
from the literature is also shown. For this comparison, we use
the period and period derivative given in Table B.1. The folded
light curve for these parameters is represented in Fig. B.2 (right
panel). We consider only the EPIC/pn camera because it has a
better time resolution (73.4 ms) than EPIC/MOS (2.6 s) (ESA:
XMM-Newton SOC 2013).

We use this folded light curve to compute the count rate
threshold which maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio. As the
magnetar ﬂux is an additional noise on the Sgr A* light curve,

The phase τ which maximizes the S/N allows us to compute the
corresponding count rate threshold (CRth). Figure B.1 shows that
there is no optimum value of the count rate threshold maximiz-
ing the S/N. Thus, we consider a count rate threshold which ﬁlters
out 50% of the magnetar ﬂux. This threshold is 0.27 count s−1
and keeps 50% of the observation time. Then, from P and ˙P,
the time interval during which the count rate of the folded light
curve is lower than CRth can be computed for all observations
