ABSTRACT

We present 1625 new 15 GHz (2 cm) VLBA images of 295 jets associated with active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) from the MOJAVE and 2 cm VLBA surveys, spanning observations between 1994 Aug 31 and
2013 Aug 20. For 274 AGNs with at least 5 VLBA epochs, we have analyzed the kinematics of 961
individual bright features in their parsec-scale jets. A total of 122 of these jets have not been previously
analyzed by the MOJAVE program. In the case of 451 jet features that had at least 10 epochs, we
also examined their kinematics for possible accelerations. At least half of the well-sampled features
have non-radial and/or accelerating trajectories, indicating that non-ballistic motion is common in
AGN jets. Since it is impossible to extrapolate any accelerations that occurred before our monitoring
period, we could only determine reliable ejection dates for ∼ 24% of those features that had signiﬁcant
proper motions. The distribution of maximum apparent jet speeds in all 295 AGNs measured by our
program to date is peaked below 5c, with very few jets with apparent speeds above 30c. The fastest
speed in our survey is ∼ 50c, measured in the jet of the quasar PKS 0805−07, and is indicative of
a maximum jet Lorentz factor of ∼ 50 in the parent population. An envelope in the maximum jet
speed versus redshift distribution of our sample provides additional evidence of this upper limit to the
speeds of radio-emitting regions in parsec-scale AGN jets. The Fermi LAT-detected gamma-ray AGNs
in our sample have, on average, higher jet speeds than non LAT-detected AGNs, indicating a strong
correlation between pc-scale jet speed and gamma-ray Doppler boosting factor. We have identiﬁed
11 moderate-redshift (z < 0.35) AGNs with fast apparent speeds (> 10c) that are strong candidates
for future TeV gamma-ray detection. Of the ﬁve gamma-ray loud narrow-lined Seyfert I AGNs in
our sample, three show highly superluminal jet motions, while the others have sub-luminal speeds.
This indicates that some narrow-lined Seyfert I AGNs possess powerful jets with Lorentz factors in
excess of 10, and viewing angles less than 10◦, consistent with those of typical BL Lac objects and
ﬂat-spectrum radio quasars.

Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) provides the
highest resolution images in astronomy, and is invaluable
for studying the structure and evolution of non-thermal
radio sources. The powerful jetted outﬂows associated
with active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are a natural target
for VLBI, since they are exceedingly compact, and domi-
nate the extragalactic sky at radio and high energy wave-
lengths. Because of their relativistic ﬂow speeds, AGN
jets are aﬀected by beaming and aberration eﬀects that
can signiﬁcantly enhance their apparent luminosity and
variability, and create the illusion of superluminal mo-
tion in the sky plane (Blandford et al. 1977). AGNs of
the rare blazar class represent cases where a high-Lorentz
factor jet is pointed nearly directly at us, thereby maxi-
mizing these relativistic Doppler eﬀects.

Starting with the 2 cm VLBA survey in 1994
(Kellermann et al. 1998), and continuing with the MO-
JAVE (Monitoring of Jets in Active Galactic Nuclei With
VLBA Experiments) program (Lister et al. 2009a), we
have carried out multi-epoch VLBA observations of sev-
eral hundred of the brightest, most compact radio sources
in the northern sky. These are predominantly blazars,

due to the selection biases associated with relativistic

In this paper, we present 1625 VLBA 15 GHz contour
maps of 295 AGNs for epochs between 1994 Aug 31
and 2013 Aug 20 that have not previously appeared
in any paper from the MOJAVE (Lister & Homan
2005; Lister et al. 2009a, 2013) or 2 cm VLBA surveys
(Kellermann et al. 1998; Zensus et al. 2002b). These
AGNs (see Table 1) are from one or more of the follow-
ing: the MOJAVE low-luminosity sample (Lister et al.
2013), the complete ﬂux density-limited MOJAVE 1.5
Jy sample (Lister et al. 2015), the VLBA 2 cm sur-
vey (Kellermann et al. 1998), the 3rd EGRET gamma-
ray catalog (Hartman et al. 1999), or the 3FGL Fermi
gamma-ray catalog (Acero et al. 2015). Also included
are some AGNs that were originally candidates for these
samples, but did not meet the ﬁnal selection criteria.

A major aspect of our program is to analyze these
multi-epoch VLBA observations in order to investigate
the evolution of pc-scale AGN jets, which we have
reported on in a series of papers (Kellermann et al.
2004; Lister et al. 2009b; Homan et al. 2009; Lister et al.
2013; Homan et al. 2015). Most AGN jets have bright,
compact radio-emitting features that move outward at
apparent superluminal speeds. These features often
change both their speed and direction, suggesting that
their kinematics are strongly aﬀected by both hydro-
dynamic and MHD plasma eﬀects (e.g., Homan et al.
2003; Cohen et al. 2015).
In our most recent analysis
(Lister et al. 2013; Homan et al. 2015), we studied the
kinematics of 200 AGN jets, for which at least 5 VLBA
epochs were obtained between 1994 Aug 31 to 2011 May
1. These AGNs were drawn from the MOJAVE 1.5 Jy
radio ﬂux density-limited and 1FM Fermi gamma-ray
selected samples, described by Lister et al. (2015) and
Lister et al. (2011), respectively. Here we present time
lapse movies and new kinematics analyses of 173 AGNs
drawn from these two samples, and 101 AGNs drawn
from the other surveys described in the previous para-

graph, using VLBA data obtained between 1994 Aug 31
and 2013 Aug 20. A total of 122 of these jets have not
previously had their kinematics analyzed by the MO-
JAVE program. We have excluded from our kinematics
analysis 48 MOJAVE AGNs we previously analyzed in
Lister et al. (2013), since we are currently gathering ad-
ditional VLBA epochs on them.

The overall layout of the paper is as follows. In Section 2
we describe our observational data and our method of
modeling the individual jet features, and in Section 3 we
discuss their kinematic properties and overall trends in
the data. We summarize our ﬁndings in Section 4. We
adopt a cosmology with Ωm = 0.27, ΩΛ = 0.73 and Ho =
71 km s−1 Mpc−1 (Komatsu et al. 2009). We refer to the
AGNs throughout using either B1950 nomenclature or
commonly-used aliases, as listed in Table 1.

2. OBSERVATIONAL DATA AND ANALYSIS

2.1. Contour Maps

We processed the VLBA interferometric visibility data
and produced contour maps (Figure 1) using the AIPS
and Difmap (Shepherd 1997) software packages, using
the methods described by Lister et al. (2009a, 2013).
The raw correlated data from the MOJAVE program are
available immediately after correlation from the NRAO
data archive11, and our processed data and maps are
publicly available on our project website12 within a few
weeks after correlation. We list the parameters of the
contour maps in Table 2. The FWHM dimensions of
the VLBA interferometric restoring beam at 15 GHz
vary with declination, but are on the order of 1 mas
(N-S) × 0.5 mas (E-W), which corresponds to a lin-
ear resolution of a few parsecs (projected) at the me-
dian redshift (z ≃ 1) of our sample. Column 4 of Ta-
ble 2 lists the VLBA project code for each observation,

each panel. The FWHM restoring beam dimensions are indicated as a cross in the lower left corner. Because of self-calibration, in some
cases the origin may be coincident with the brightest feature in the image, rather than the putative core feature listed in Table 3. This is

along with an indicator of whether it is from the MO-
JAVE program, the VLBA 2 cm Survey, or the NRAO
data archive. For the latter, we considered only archival
epochs with at least 4 individual scans that spanned a
reasonably wide range of hour angle, and that included
at least 8 VLBA antennas. The VLBA 2 cm Survey ob-
servations (1994–2002) consisted of approximately one
hour integrations on each AGN, broken up into several
scans separated in hour angle to improve the interfero-
metric coverage. A similar observing method was used
in the full polarization MOJAVE observations from 2002
May to 2007 September (VLBA codes BL111, BL123,
BL137, and BL149), and is described by Lister & Homan
(2005). During 2006 (VLBA code BL137), the 15 GHz
integration times were shortened by a factor of ∼ 3 to
accommodate interleaved scans at three other observing
frequencies (8.1, 8.4, 12.1 GHz). The latter were pub-
lished by Hovatta et al. (2012), Pushkarev et al. (2012),
and Hovatta et al. (2014). The MOJAVE and 2 cm Sur-
vey observations were originally recorded at a data rate
of 128 Mbps, which was increased to 256 Mbps for the
epochs from 2007 July 3 to 2008 Sept 12 inclusive, and
512 Mbps thereafter. Beginning with the 2007 Jan 6
epoch, we increased the number of AGNs observed in
each 24 hour MOJAVE session from 18 to 25 AGNs, and
to 30 AGNs on 2009 Feb 25.

2.2. Time-lapse Movies

In Figures 2 and 3 we show linearly interpolated time-
lapse MPEG movies of the multi-epoch VLBA images
for two selected AGNs (4C +67.05 and PKS 2345−16).
Movies for the other AGNs can be found on the MO-
JAVE website. We constructed the movies using a two-
point linear interpolation across each successive epoch,
treating each map pixel independently. Prior to inter-
polation, we restored all of the epoch maps to a scale
of 0.05 milliarcseconds per pixel using identical median
beam dimensions that were based on the full set of nat-
urally weighted VLBA epochs available for that AGN.
We did not interpolate across any time gaps larger than
4 years, leaving these periods instead as blank frames in
the movie. The false-color corresponds to radio ﬂux den-
sity in units of Jy per beam (indicated by scale bar on
the right side of the frames). One year of calendar time
corresponds to 2.5 seconds of run time in the movies.

2.3. Gaussian Modeling

We modeled the (u, v) visibility data in Difmap using a
set of Gaussian features, which we list in Table 3. In some
instances, it was not possible to robustly cross-identify
the same features in a jet from one epoch to the next. We
indicate those features with robust cross-identiﬁcations
across at least 5 epochs in column 10 of Table 3. For the
non-robust features, we caution that the assignment of
the same identiﬁcation number across epochs does not
necessarily indicate a reliable cross-identiﬁcation.

Based on previous analysis (Lister et al. 2009b), we es-
timate the typical uncertainties in the Gaussian cen-
troid positions to be ∼ 20% of the FWHM beam di-
mensions. For isolated bright and compact features, the
positional errors are smaller by approximately a factor
of two. We estimate the formal errors on the feature

Figure 2. Linearly interpolated time-lapse movie made from the
multi-epoch VLBA images for 4C +67.05. Each epoch is restored
with a median beam, whose FWHM dimensions are indicated
by the cross in the lower left corner. The false-color corresponds
to radio ﬂux density in units of Jy per beam (indicated by scale
bar on the right side of the frames). One year of calendar time
corresponds to 2.5 seconds in the movies. This movie is available at

to Fomalont (1999). The ﬂux density accuracies are ap-
proximately 5% (see Appendix A of Homan et al. 2002),
but can be signiﬁcantly larger for features located very
close to one another. Also, at some epochs which had an-
tenna dropouts, the ﬁt errors of some features are much
larger. We do not use the latter in our kinematics anal-
ysis, and indicate them by ﬂags in Table 3.

tures that had measurements at 10 or more epochs, our
second method employed a constant acceleration model
that yielded kinematic ﬁt quantities at a (midpoint) ref-
erence date located exactly halfway between the ﬁrst and
last VLBA observation dates for that particular AGN
(see column 9 of Table 5). The results of these analyses
are listed separately in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively.
For completeness, these tables also include kinematic ﬁt
parameters for 48 AGNs (indicated by ﬂags in column
1) that we analyzed in Lister et al. (2013), but not in

this paper. We note that for features that show signiﬁ-
cant (≥ 3σ) accelerations, the acceleration-ﬁt speed and
other parameters in Table 5 provide a better description
of their motions, hence for these features we will use the
acceleration ﬁt quantities in subsequent statistical anal-
yses and discussion of their kinematics.

In the left hand panels of Figure 4 we show the positions
and kinematic motion ﬁts to the individual features on
the sky, as well as a 15 GHz VLBA contour image of
the jet at the observation epoch that is closest to the
(midpoint) reference date. The orange box delimits the
zoomed region displayed in the right hand panels, with
the cross-hairs indicating the feature’s position at this
epoch.

core position. The left hand panels show a 15 GHz VLBA contour image of the jet at the epoch listed in Table 5, which is closest to the
(midpoint) reference epoch. The orange box delimits the zoomed region that is displayed in the right hand panels. The feature’s position
at the image epoch is indicated by the orange cross-hairs. The dotted line connects the feature with the core feature and is plotted with
the mean position angle hϑi. The position at the image epoch is shown by a ﬁlled violet circle while other epochs are plotted with unﬁlled
blue circles. The red solid line indicates the vector ﬁt (or accelerating ﬁt, if there is signiﬁcant acceleration) to the feature positions. The
gray dashed circles/ellipses represent the FWHM sizes of the individual ﬁtted Gaussian features. A red vector motion direction arrow is
indicated in all of the plots, including features for which the angular speed is extremely slow and/or statistically insigniﬁcant. This is a

weighted average of the extrapolated emergence epochs
in the right ascension (tα) and declination (tδ) directions
(columns 13 and 14 of Table 4). The individual val-
ues of tα and tδ describe the ﬁts, but do not necessarily
have physical meaning, depending on the proper motion
vector direction, the statistical signiﬁcance of the ﬁtted
motion, and/or accelerations that may be present. We
include them in the motion tables for completeness only.
We used the method described in Lister et al. (2013) to
calculate the errors on the ejection times.

Due to the nature of our proper motion ﬁts, which nat-
urally include the possibility of non-ballistic motion, we
did not estimate ejection times for any features where
we could not conﬁdently extrapolate their motion to
the core. Jet features for which we estimated ejection
epochs had the following properties: (i) signiﬁcant mo-
tion (µ ≥ 3σµ), (ii) no signiﬁcant acceleration, (iii) a ve-
locity vector within 15◦ of the outward radial direction
to high conﬁdence, i.e., |hϑi − φ| + 2σ ≤ 15◦, (iv) an ex-
trapolated position at the ejection epoch no more than
0.2 mas from the core, and (v) a ﬁtted ejection epoch
that diﬀered by no more than 0.5 years from that given
by a simple one-dimensional (radial) motion ﬁt.

We list the parameters of our acceleration ﬁts in Table 5,
where we have resolved the acceleration terms ˙µ⊥ and
˙µk in directions perpendicular and parallel, respectively,
to the mean angular velocity direction φ (columns 7 and
8). We quote two uncertainty values in these accelera-
tion terms. The value in parentheses is the statistical
uncertainty due to the acceleration ﬁt itself, and is the
appropriate quantity for determining if a signiﬁcant ac-
celeration occurred relative to the velocity vector direc-
tion. The total uncertainty value incorporates an esti-
mate of the eﬀect of a possibly poorly known velocity
direction when assigning these accelerations the labels
“parallel” or “perpendicular”. For example, the uncer-
tainty on the parallel acceleration adds in quadrature the

term q( ˙µ⊥dφ)2 + (cid:0)( ˙µkdφ)dφ(cid:1)2

, where dφ is the uncer-
tainty in the velocity direction in radians, and takes on a
maximum value of 1.0 in this expression. An analogous
term is added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty
for the perpendicular acceleration. In our previous pa-
pers, we listed the acceleration ﬁt uncertainty alone, and
did not include any additional error due to uncertainty
in the vector motion direction. Instead, as described in
Homan et al. (2009) and Homan et al. (2015), we limited
our detailed acceleration analysis in those papers to jet
features where the velocity direction was very well known
and therefore the parallel and perpendicular assignments
were unambiguous.

Of the 451 features in our current analysis with more
than 10 epochs, 144 (32%) show signiﬁcant accelerations,
and an additional 87 show non-radial motions. Thus
over half of the well-sampled jet features in our survey
show evidence of non-ballistic motion. In agreement with
our previous ﬁndings (Homan et al. 2009, 2015), appar-
ent speed changes are larger and more prevalent than
changes in direction, indicating that changes in Lorentz
factor are more responsible for the observed accelerations
than jet bends.

Figure 5. Plot of angular separation from the core versus epoch
for Gaussian jet features. The B1950 source name is given at the
top left of each panel. Colored symbols indicate robust features
for which kinematic ﬁts were obtained (dotted and solid lines).
The solid lines indicate vector motion ﬁts to the data points as-
suming no acceleration, while the dotted lines indicate accelerated
motion ﬁts. Thick lines are used for features whose ﬁtted mo-
tion is along a radial direction from the core, while thin lines indi-
cate non-radial motions. Unﬁlled colored circles indicate individual
data points that were not used in the kinematic ﬁts, and unﬁlled
black circles indicate non-robust features. The feature identiﬁca-
tion number is indicated next to the last epoch of each robust
feature. This is a ﬁgure stub, the full set of plots is available at
http://www.astro.purdue.edu/MOJAVE/allsources.html.

We note that many of the jet features in our sample
display non-radial motion, i.e., the ﬁtted velocity vector
at the reference epoch does not point back to the core
feature. This is indicative of accelerated, non-ballistic
motion.
In some cases, an extrapolation of our sim-
ple constant acceleration ﬁt shows the feature passing
through the core feature at the ejection epoch within the
errors, as expected. However, in many other cases, the
acceleration(s) are either complex, occurred before our
monitoring period, or took place close to the core below
our angular resolution level. These unknown accelera-
tions strictly limit the number of features for which we
can derive reliable ejection epochs, and can cause an ap-
parent inﬂection in the ﬁt line at minimum separation
(e.g., feature id = 5 of 0736+017) in the plots of radial
separation from the core versus time (see Figure 5).

We examined each feature with signiﬁcant proper motion
(µ ≥ 3σµ) for non-radial motion by comparing the mean
position angle of the feature hϑi with its proper motion
vector direction φ. We ﬂagged any feature for which the
angular oﬀset |hϑi − φ| was ≥ 3σ from both 0◦ and 180◦
as non-radial, and inward if the oﬀset was signiﬁcantly
greater than 90◦. Of the 714 newly analyzed features
with statistically signiﬁcant (≥ 3σ) proper motion, 228
(32%) exhibit signiﬁcant non-radial motion, while only
25 (4%) are ﬂagged as inward (see Table 4). The lat-
ter can be the result of curved trajectories that are ap-
proaching the line of sight, internal brightness changes in
a large, diﬀuse jet feature, or backward pattern speeds
not associated with the ﬂow. We discuss these rare indi-
vidual inward motion cases in the Appendix.

We calculated ejection times (epoch of zero core sepa-
ration) for the non-accelerating, non-inward moving fea-
tures with signiﬁcant motion by taking an error-based

3. DISCUSSION

3.1. Jet Speed Distributions

We have calculated maximum and median speed statis-
tics for all 274 AGN jets measured in this paper, and
48 AGNs in Lister et al. (2013), using the method de-
scribed in the latter paper. For those AGNs that were
analyzed in both papers, we used the kinematic results
from the current paper. The combined set of 322 AGNs
spans the full sky above declination −30◦, and all sources
have at least ∼ 0.1 Jy of VLBA correlated ﬂux density
at 15 GHz. Although the set is complete above 1.5 Jy
(Lister et al. 2015) and at high γ-ray (time-averaged)
ﬂuxes (Lister et al. 2011), the selection is incomplete
and non-uniform at lower radio ﬂux densities, containing
a sampling of gamma-ray-associated and un-associated
AGNs, as well as lower-luminosity AGN targeted specif-
ically to probe the relation between jet speed and radio
luminosity (Lister et al. 2013). Because of the > 0.1 Jy
VLBA limit at 15 GHz, the combined set of AGN has
a substantial bias toward core-dominated, ﬂat-spectrum
radio sources, which are expected to be highly beamed.
This is reﬂected in the optical classiﬁcations, which are
dominated by blazars (i.e., ﬂat spectrum radio quasars:
73% and BL Lac objects: 18%). There are also 22 radio
galaxies and 5 narrow-lined Seyfert I (NLSY1) galaxies,
and 4 AGNs with no optically identiﬁed counterparts. A
total of 243 AGNs have published gamma-ray associa-
tions, which are listed in column 4 of Table 1.

In Figure 6 we plot the speed distributions for the com-
bined set of AGNs (left hand panels), and for the radio
ﬂux density-limited MOJAVE 1.5 Jy sample only (right
hand panels). As discussed by Vermeulen & Cohen
(1994) and Lister & Marscher (1997), the shape of the
apparent speed distribution in a ﬂux density-limited jet
sample reﬂects the parent Lorentz factor distribution,
which in this case,
indicates a moderately steep par-
ent power law, with fast jets being relatively rare. A
more detailed analysis of the parent population prop-
erties will be presented in a future paper. Because of
Doppler bias, the fastest apparent speeds in a large ﬂux
density-limited sample should also be indicative of the
maximum bulk ﬂow Lorentz factors in the parent pop-
ulation. The fastest overall jet speed we have measured
in our survey to date is feature id = 2 in the quasar
PKS 0805−07, with µ = 503 ± 62 µas y−1 , correspond-
ing to 40c ± 5c. In terms of angular expansion rate, the
maximum values of our survey are limited to roughly
< 3000 µas y−1 due to our limited angular resolution
and observing cadence. The fastest measured angular
speed in our survey to date is 2941 ± 109 µas y−1 , in the
jet of the nearby (z = 0.033) AGN 3C 120 (Lister et al.
2013).

We note that there are two accelerating features whose
apparent speed exceeded 40c at some point during our
monitoring (the speeds listed in Table 5 are the instanta-
neous speeds at the midpoint epoch). These are feature
id = 3 in PKS 0805−07, which had an initial speed of
∼ 50c in 1996 and subsequently decelerated to ∼ 20c,

and feature id = 16 in PKS 1510−08, which attained a
maximum speed of ∼ 42c before fading in 2011.

In Lister et al. (2013), we identiﬁed 38 jet features
as having slow pattern speeds,
i.e., they had non-
accelerating, angular speeds smaller than 20 µas y−1 ,
and a speed at least 10 times slower than the fastest
feature in the same jet. With the addition of our new
kinematics analysis, we now have identiﬁed a total of 63
such features (5% of all robust features), which we have
ﬂagged in Table 4.

3.2. Jet Speed and Gamma-Ray Emission

The most recent catalog of gamma-ray sources detected
by the Fermi LAT instrument (3FGL: Acero et al. 2015)
is highly dominated by blazars, due to the strong inﬂu-
ence of relativistic beaming on jet gamma-ray emission.
As discussed by Lister et al. (2015), based on data from
Lister et al. (2013), nearly all of the fastest AGN jets
in the MOJAVE program have been detected by Fermi,
indicating a strong correlation between jet speed and
gamma-ray Doppler boosting factor. Several fast jets
have yet to be detected by Fermi because their spectral
energy distribution peaks below the 100 MeV threshold
of the LAT. In Figure 7, we show the distributions of
fastest and median jet speed for our full MOJAVE sample
(top panels), and our 1.5 Jy ﬂux density-limited sample
(lower panels), including our new speed data. In terms

of the fastest measured speeds, there is a less than 0.02
% probability that the LAT and non-LAT sub-samples
come from the same parent distribution according to
Kolomogorov-Smirnov tests, in the case of both the full
and MOJAVE 1.5 Jy ﬂux density-limited samples.

3.3. Apparent Jet Speed Versus Redshift

In Figure 8 we plot maximum measured apparent jet
speed versus redshift for all jets measured by the MO-
JAVE program to date. For completeness, we also plot
as lower limits equal to 0.015c those AGN jets for which
we were not able to identify any robust features for kine-
matics analysis, despite having at least 5 VLBA epochs.

This collection of AGNs represents those selected from
the MOJAVE radio ﬂux density-limited, gamma-ray-
selected, and low-luminosity blazar samples. As such,
it spans a very large range of redshift (0.004 < z < 3.4)
and apparent radio luminosity (1023 − 1029 W Hz−1). At
low redshifts, lower luminosity radio galaxies and BL Lac
objects dominate, since high luminosity quasars are much
rarer in the general AGN population (see, e.g., discussion
of luminosity functions in Urry & Padovani 1995).

Our monthly observing cadence, total time baseline, and
angular resolution set limits on the maximum and mini-
mum observable angular proper motions, which we plot
as dotted lines in Figure 8. We note that for z > 0.3, our

Figure 8. Log-log plot of maximum apparent jet speed versus redshift for all jets measured by the MOJAVE program to date. The
dotted lines delimit the approximate survey limits on angular proper motions, based on our angular resolution, temporal coverage, and
observing cadence. Black circles correspond to quasars, red triangles to high spectral peaked BL Lac objects, blue squares to other BL Lacs,
green stars to radio galaxies, and purple diamonds to NLSY1s. Filled symbols indicate AGNs that have been detected at TeV gamma-ray
energies. Jets for which were not able to identify any robust features for kinematic analysis are plotted as lower limits with an arbitrary
value of 0.015 c.

survey is sensitive to extremely high jet speeds, yet there
is a distinct upper envelope to the distribution. Since
there must be a portion of the ultrafast AGN jet popu-
lation that is oriented close to our line of sight, and such
jets will be extremely bright due to enormous Doppler
boosting of their radio ﬂux density, the upper envelope
in Figure 8 is a clear indication of an upper limit of ∼ 50
in the bulk Lorentz factors in the pc-scale radio-emitting
regions of AGN jets.

In Figure 8 we have also indicated with ﬁlled symbols
those AGNs that have been detected at TeV gamma-ray
energies. To date, there are roughly 60 known AGNs in
this category13, and one third of these have been mon-
itored by the MOJAVE program. Our plot illustrates
the two types of known TeV AGN: i) BL Lac objects
that have high TeV ﬂuxes due to their proximity and the
fact that their spectral energy distributions are peaked
at high frequencies; and ii) other BL Lac objects and
quasars with very fast jet speeds, indicating unusually
high amounts of relativistic beaming. To date there
have been no TeV detections of AGNs past z ≃ 1 due
to the strong attenuation of high energy gamma-rays by
pair production oﬀ of the extragalactic background light.
This would suggest that a promising region to search for
new TeV-emitting AGNs is in the top left corner of Fig-
ure 8, where βapp > 10c and z < 0.35. This region
includes the BL Lac objects PKS 0754+100, OJ 287 and

13 http://tevcat.uchicago.edu

OJ 049, the quasars 3C 273, OI 061, 4C +49.22, TXS
1700+685, and PKS 1725+044, the AGNs 3C 111 and
3C 120, and the NLSY1 1H 0323+342.

We have measured maximum jet speeds for 9 high spec-
tral peaked (HSP) BL Lacs to date in the MOJAVE
program (triangle symbols in Figure 8), all but one of
which (7C 1055+5644) have been detected at TeV en-
ergies. Their apparent speeds are sub-luminal, ranging
from 0.03c ± 0.01c in ON 325 to 2.6c ± 1.1c in OQ 240.
This is in agreement with previous multi-epoch VLBI
observations of a small number of TeV blazar jets at 8
GHz by Piner et al. (2008). We are currently obtaining
multi-epoch MOJAVE observations of a much larger set
of high-spectral peaked AGN detected by the Fermi γ-
ray observatory in order to further investigate their speed
distribution.

3.4. Radio-loud Narrow-Lined Seyfert I AGNs

The third Fermi AGN catalog (Ackermann et al. 2015) is
comprised primarily of blazars, reﬂecting the strong in-
ﬂuence of relativistic boosting on AGN gamma-ray emis-
sion. Apart from a small handful of nearby radio galax-
ies, the only other major AGN category in the Fermi
catalog is radio-loud NLSY1 galaxies. To date fewer
than a dozen gamma-ray-loud NLSY1s have been identi-
ﬁed (Berton et al. 2015), but they are interesting objects
since they appear to have many of the same characteris-
tics as blazars, despite the fact that Seyferts are typically

12

M. L. Lister et al.

found in spiral host galaxies. The orientation of NLSY1s
renders their broad line region visible, yet they display
narrow permitted lines (< 2000 km s−1) due to their
small black hole masses (106 − 108M⊙). Therefore in
order to produce blazar-like gamma-ray and radio lumi-
nosities, they must have high Eddington ratios. This has
led to speculation that they might be young radio jets
that have been recently fueled, and are perhaps the low-
black-hole mass, low-viewing angle versions of compact
symmetric AGNs (e.g., Kawakatu et al. 2009).

We have analyzed the pc-scale jet kinematics of ﬁve
NLSY1s in the MOJAVE sample, all of which have
been detected in gamma-rays by Fermi. Other groups
(D’Ammando et al. 2012, 2013) have published simple
one-dimensional radial-ﬁt speeds for two of these AGNs
using our MOJAVE data. We ﬁnd that three of the
NLSY1s show highly superluminal jet features (9.0c ±
0.3c for 1H 0323+342, 5.8c ± 0.9c for SBS 0846+513,
and 11.5c ± 1.5c for PMN J0948+0022). The other
two show kinematics consistent with sub-luminal speeds:
0.9c ± 0.3c for 4C +04.42 and 1.1c ± 0.4c for 1502+036.
With this small sample size, it is impossible to draw any
general conclusions about the population, but the high
speeds indicate that at least some radio-loud NLSY1s
have Lorentz factors in excess of 10, and viewing angles
less than 10◦, consistent with those of BL Lac objects
and ﬂat-spectrum radio quasars.

4. SUMMARY

We have presented 1625 new 15 GHz VLBA contour im-
ages of 295 AGNs from the MOJAVE and 2cm VLBA
surveys, spanning epochs from 1994 Aug 31 to 2013 Aug
20. For the 274 AGNs with at least 5 temporally-spaced
epochs, we have analyzed the kinematics of individual
bright features in the jets, and produced time-lapse lin-
early interpolated movies that show their parsec-scale
evolution. At least half of the well-sampled features
show non-radial and/or accelerating trajectories, indi-
cating that non-ballistic motion is common. Since it
is impossible to extrapolate any accelerations that oc-
curred before our monitoring period or below our resolu-
tion level, we are only able to determine reliable ejection
dates for ∼ 24% of those features with signiﬁcant proper
motions.

The distribution of maximum jet speeds in all 295 AGNs
measured by our program to date is peaked below 5c,
with very few jets with apparent speeds above 30c. The
fastest instantaneous measured speed in our survey is
∼ 50c, measured in the jet of the quasar PKS 0805−07.

The form of the speed distribution is indicative of a mod-
erately steep power law distribution of Lorentz factors in
the parent population, ranging up to Γ ≃ 50. An upper
envelope in the maximum speed versus redshift distribu-
tion provides additional evidence of this upper limit to
AGN jet speeds in the pc-scale regime.

The Fermi LAT-detected gamma-ray AGNs in our sam-
ple have, on average, higher jet speeds than non LAT-
detected AGNs, indicating a strong correlation between
pc-scale jet speed and gamma-ray Doppler boosting fac-
tor. The known TeV gamma-ray emitting AGNs in our
sample are clustered in two regions: namely at low red-
shift/low speeds, and at moderate redshift/high speeds.
We have identiﬁed 11 AGNs in the latter region (βapp >
10c, z < 0.35) that are strong candidates for future TeV
gamma-ray detection. Our AGN sample also includes 5
gamma-ray-loud NLSY1s, a rare type of low-black hole
mass, high-accretion rate AGN that has been identiﬁed
as a distinct population of gamma-ray emitting AGNs
by Fermi. Of the ﬁve NLSY1s, three show highly super-
luminal jet motions, while the others have sub-luminal
speeds. This indicates that radio-loud NLSY1 AGNs can
possess powerful jets with high Lorentz factors and low
viewing angles that are consistent with typical radio loud
BL Lac objects and ﬂat-spectrum radio quasars.

estimates. It is one of two possible 3LAC associations for 3FGL J0009.1+0630 listed by Ackermann et al. (2015). The
other is CRATES J0009+0625.

0048−097 (PKS 0048−09): The jet structure is too compact at 15 GHz to reliably measure any robust features.

0106+678 (4C +67.04): This BL Lac has an inward-moving feature (id = 4) located 1.3 mas from the core.

0109+224 (S2 0109+22) : The redshift z = 0.265 from Shaw et al. (2012) is claimed to be incorrect according to

MOJAVE. XIII. Parsec-Scale AGN Jet Kinematics 1994–2013

13

Paiano et al. (2016), who ﬁnd a lower limit of z > 0.35, based on new optical spectroscopy.

0108+388 (CGRABS J0111+3906): Multi-frequency VLBA images of this radio galaxy indicate a two-sided jet mor-
phology, however, the precise location of the core is not known (Marr et al. 2001). We therefore used the southwestern-
most bright feature in the images as a reference point for the kinematics analysis.

0111+021 (UGC 00773): With the addition of one more epoch in 2013 since our Lister et al. (2013) analysis, we now
classify a total of four features in this BL Lac jet as inward-moving.
0118−272 (OC −230.4): This BL Lac has a very slow inward-moving feature (25 ± 7 µas y−1 ) located 0.5 mas from
the core. Shaw et al. (2013) found z < 0.558 based on intergalactic absorption features in the optical spectrum.

0119+041 (PKS 0119+041): The jet structure is too compact at 15 GHz to reliably measure any robust features.

0141+268 (TXS 0141+268): Shaw et al. (2009) reported z < 2.41 for this BL Lac object.

0219+428 (3C 66A): The two innermost jet features of this BL Lac object have robust inward motions. No reliable
spectroscopic redshift has been published to date. Stadnik & Romani (2014) reported z > 0.42 based on the host
galaxy magnitude.

0235+164 (AO 0235+164): The jet structure is too compact at 15 GHz to reliably measure any robust features.

0300+470 (4C +47.08): No reliable spectroscopic redshift exists for this BL Lac is unknown Shaw et al. (2013), which
contains an inward-moving feature (id = 1) at 0.8 mas from the core feature.

0301−243 (PKS 0301−243): The innermost feature of this BL Lac jet has a robust inward motion.

0346+800 (S5 0346+80): No reliable spectroscopic redshift exists in the literature for this BL Lac object.

0414−189 (PKS 0414−189): The jet structure is too compact at 15 GHz to reliably measure any robust features.

0440−003 (NRAO 190): This quasar is one of two possible 3LAC associations for 3FGL J0442.6−0017 listed by
Ackermann et al. (2015). The other is a radio-quiet X-ray source (1RXS J044229.8−001823) which is 2.3 arcmin from
the LAT position (as compared to 0.21 arcmin for 0440−003).

0454+844 (S5 0454+84): The value of z = 1.340 from Rector & Stocke (2001) is a lower limit, and the value z = 0.113
from Lawrence et al. (1996) is considered tentative.

0506+056 (TXS 0506+056): As described by Lister et al. (2013), this BL Lac object has an inward-moving feature
(id = 3) at 1.3 mas from the core feature.

0615+820 (S5 0615+82): The jet structure is too compact to reliably identify the core position at all epochs, or to
classify any jet features as robust.

0640+090 (PMN J0643+0857): The position of the core feature in this low-galactic latitude quasar is uncertain, and
we considered none of the jet features to be robust. We used the highest brightness temperature feature as a reference
point for the kinematics analysis.

0646+600 (S4 0646+60): This is a high-frequency peaked quasar (Dallacasa et al. 2000) with two-sided parsec-scale
radio structure, meeting the criteria for a compact symmetric object. The outermost jet feature at ∼ 3 mas from the
core has slow but signiﬁcant inward motion (10 ± 0.7 µas y−1 ).

0727−115 (PKS 0727−11): The radio morphology of this quasar was too compact and complex to identify any suitably
robust jet features for kinematic analysis.

0742+103 (J0745+1011): This high redshift quasar has a gigahertz-peaked spectrum and jet emission to both the
NW and SE of the brightest feature in the maps. The core location is unknown, making it impossible to reliably
cross-register the maps across the epochs or to classify any jet features as robust.

0743−006 (J0745-0044): The position of the core in this gigahertz-peaked spectrum AGN is uncertain. We used the
position of the most compact feature in the maps as a reference point for the kinematics analysis.

0745+241 (S3 0745+24): The jet feature at 3.4 mas from the core (id = 11) has signiﬁcant inward motion.

0804+499 (OJ 508): This quasar is one of two possible 3LAC associations for 3FGL J0807.9+4946 listed by
Ackermann et al. (2015). The other is a double-lobed radio galaxy (J0807+4946) with no visible radio core in the
FIRST survey image, located 7.74 arcmin from the LAT position (as compared to 0.77 arcmin for OJ 508).

0814+425 (OJ 425): The value of z = 0.53 from Linford et al. (2012) is uncertain, while Shaw et al. (2013) reported
z < 2.47 and Sbarufatti et al. (2005) obtained z > 0.75. As described in Lister et al. (2013), the innermost feature (id
= 5) has robust inward motion.

0821+394 (4C +39.23): This quasar is one of two possible 3LAC associations for 3FGL J0824.9+3916 listed by
Ackermann et al. (2015). The other is the compact steep-spectrum quasar 4C +39.23B (Dallacasa et al. 2002).

14

M. L. Lister et al.

0823−223 (PKS 0823−223): The value of z = 0.91 from Falomo (1990) is a lower limit. We could not identify any
suitably robust jet features for kinematic analysis in this BL Lac.

0946+006 (PMN J0948+0022): Using additional VLBA epochs on this narrow-lined Seyfert I galaxy obtained since
our Lister et al. (2013) analysis, we now classify two jet features as robust.

0954+658 (S4 0954+65): The widely cited redshift of z = 0.367 by Stickel et al. (1993) has been drawn in to question
by Landoni et al. (2015), who ﬁnd a featureless spectrum and a limit z > 0.45 based on non-detection of the host
galaxy. We note that for z > 1.7, our apparent speed measurement of µ = 672 ± 50 µas y−1 would yield vapp ≃ 50c,
a value larger than the fastest measured speed of any AGN in the MOJAVE program.

1030+415 (S4 1030+41): The jet structure is too compact at 15 GHz to reliably measure any robust features.

1101+384 (Mrk 421): The innermost feature (id = 8) in this nearby BL Lac jet has slow but signiﬁcant inward motion.

1124−186 (PKS 1124−186): The jet structure is too compact at 15 GHz to reliably measure any robust features.

1128+385 (B2 1128+38): The outermost feature in this jet has signiﬁcant inward motion.

1144+402 (S4 1144+40): This quasar is one of two possible associations listed for 3FGL J1146.8+3958 by
Ackermann et al. (2015). The other is the weak radio source NVSS J114653+395751, which showed less than 1
mJy of correlated VLBA ﬂux density at 1.4 GHz in the mJIVE-20 survey of Deller & Middelberg (2014).

1148−001 (4C −00.47): The position of the core in this high redshift (z = 1.98) quasar is uncertain. We used the
position of the most compact feature in the maps as a reference point for the kinematics analysis.

1213−172 (PKS 1213−17): This AGN is located very close on the sky to a bright star, and has no reliable spectroscopic
redshift in the literature.

1219+044 (4C +04.42): Yao et al. (2015) have classiﬁed this AGN as a NLSY1 galaxy, based on its optical spectrum
from the SDSS-BOSS survey.

1219+285 (W Comae): A feature (id = 17) located ∼ 1 mas from the core has signiﬁcant inward motion.

1243−072 (PKS 1243−072): This quasar is listed as an association in the third EGRET catalog (Hartman et al. 1999),
but not in any of the Fermi catalogs.

1324+224 (B2 1324+22): The jet structure is too compact at 15 GHz to reliably measure any robust features.

1329−126 (PMN J1332−1256): We did not identify any suitably robust jet features for kinematic analysis in this
quasar.

1331+170 (OP 151): This quasar is listed as an association in the third EGRET catalog (Hartman et al. 1999), but
was not conﬁrmed in the revised EGRET catalog of Casandjian & Grenier (2008). It is not listed in any of the Fermi
catalogs.

1413+135 (J1415+1320): This unusual BL Lac object resides in a spiral host galaxy (Perlman et al. 2002), and has a
two-sided jet structure (Gugliucci et al. 2005). The core is associated with the brightest feature in our VLBA images.

1435+638 (VIPS 0792): We presumed the radio core to lie at the northernmost end of the jet, based on the VIPS 5
GHz VLBA map of Helmboldt et al. (2007).

1458+718 (3C 309.1): This compact steep spectrum quasar has a group of inward moving jet features located 23 mas
south of the core. On larger scales, the radio morphology suggests a twisting (helical) jet structure (Ludke et al. 1998).

1508−055 (PKS 1508−05): This compact steep spectrum quasar is listed as a gamma-ray association in the 3LAC
catalog (Ackermann et al. 2015). We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant proper motion in two robust jet features.

1509+054 (PMN J1511+0518): This gigahertz-peaked spectrum radio galaxy has a two-sided jet morphology
(Hovatta et al. 2014), and a statistically signiﬁcant inward moving feature (id = 2). However, it is possible that
we are merely seeing changes in the internal brightness distribution of unresolved features in this jet, and not true
apparent motion.

1510−089 (PKS 1510−08): Many of the features in this jet (e.g., id = 8,15,16) show complex kinematics, including a
kink in their trajectories at 2 mas from the core that are not well approximated by a constant acceleration model.

1514+004 (PKS 1514+00): The brightness proﬁle along this nearby (z = 0.052) radio galaxy jet is very smooth, and
not well-represented by discrete Gaussian features.

1519−273 (PKS 1519−273): The jet structure is too compact at 15 GHz to reliably measure any robust features.

1529−131 (PMN J1532−1319): There is no known optical counterpart for this AGN. We could not identify any suitably
robust jet features for kinematic analysis.

1548+056 (4C +05.64): The southernmost jet feature, which we presume marks the location of the core, faded in the
2005 October 29 epoch, thus we have not used this epoch in our kinematics analysis.

MOJAVE. XIII. Parsec-Scale AGN Jet Kinematics 1994–2013

15

1611+343 (DA 406): The morphology and complex kinematics of this quasar jet suggest that it is bending into our
line of sight several milliarcseconds from the core, and that we may be seeing features from both the front and back
sides of the jet.

1622−253 (PKS 1622−253): The jet structure is too compact at 15 GHz to reliably measure any robust features.

1637+826 (NGC 6251): In Lister et al. (2013) we reported an inward-moving feature (id = 8) in this radio galaxy jet.
With the addition of two new epochs, this feature no longer shows any statistically signiﬁcant motion.

1656+053 (PKS 1656+053): We could not identify any suitably robust jet features for kinematic analysis in this
quasar.

1656+477 (S4 1656+47): We could not identify any suitably robust jet features for kinematic analysis in this quasar.

1739+522 (4C +51.37): The jet structure is too compact at 15 GHz to reliably measure any robust features.

1741−038 (PKS 1741−03): The jet structure is too compact at 15 GHz to reliably measure any robust features.

1749+701 (S4 1749+70 : All of the jet features in this BL Lac show transverse motions, including the innermost
feature, which evolves from a position angle of −50◦ to −75◦ over a 15 year period.

1842+681 (S4 1842+68): We could not identify any suitably robust jet features for kinematic analysis in this quasar.

1923+210 (PKS B1923+210): This low galactic latitude AGN has a featureless optical spectrum, as reported by
Titov et al. (2011).

1958−179 (PKS 1958−179): The jet structure is too compact at 15 GHz to reliably measure any robust features.

2021+614 (OW 637): The core feature location in this jet remains uncertain (Lister et al. 2009b). The two outermost
features (ID = 1 and 2) have inward motions, albeit with very slow speeds (8.8 and 19.6 µas y−1 , respectively).

2023+335 (B2 2023+33): This low galactic latitude quasar is strongly aﬀected by interstellar scattering
(Pushkarev et al. 2013). The radio structure was too complex to reliably cross-identify any robust features for
kinematic analysis. Examples of this kind of strong scattering are extremely rare among bright, compact AGN
Pushkarev & Kovalev (2015).

2047+098 (PKS 2047+098): This AGN has no known optical counterpart. The value z = 0.01513 listed in the 2LAC
(Ackermann et al. 2011) data table is unreferenced. Its jet has two inward moving features (id = 2 and 3).

2128−123 (PKS 2128−12): The overall kinematics and polarization structure of this quasar underwent sudden and
dramatic changes in 2009.

2144+092 (PKS 2144+092): We could not identify any suitably robust jet features for kinematic analysis in this
quasar.

2155+312 (B2 2155+31): We could not identify any suitably robust jet features for kinematic analysis in this quasar.

2230+114 (CTA 102): By using additional VLBA epochs obtained since Lister et al. (2013), we now identify two
robust inward-moving features (id = 1 and 4) in this quasar jet. These were also identiﬁed in the multi-frequency
VLBI kinematic analysis of this AGN by Fromm et al. (2013).

2234+282 (CTD 135): An et al. (2016) have claimed this BL Lac to be a compact symmetric object with a two-sided
jet, based on a comparison of VLBA maps at 8.4 and 15 GHz. However, the angular resolution is insuﬃcient to
determine a spectral index for the putative core feature. For the purposes of our kinematic analysis we have identiﬁed
the core with the northernmost jet feature in our maps.

2247−283 (PMN J2250−2806): By using additional VLBA epochs we have obtained since Lister et al. (2013), we are
able to identify one robust feature in this quasar jet.

2356+196 (PKS 2356+196): This quasar is listed as an association in the third EGRET catalog (Hartman et al. 1999),
but was not conﬁrmed in the revised EGRET catalog of Casandjian & Grenier (2008). It is not listed in any of the
Fermi catalogs.
