Abstract

The infrared dynamics of 2 + 1 dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED3) with a
large number N of fermion ﬂavors is governed by an interacting CFT that can be studied
in the 1/N expansion. We use the 1/N expansion to calculate the scaling dimensions of
all the lowest three scalar operators that transform under the SU (N ) ﬂavor symmetry as a
Young diagram with two columns of not necessarily equal heights and that have vanishing
topological charge. In the case of SU (N ) singlets, we study the mixing of ( ¯ψiψi)( ¯ψjψj) and
FµνF µν, which are the lowest dimension parity-even singlets. Our results suggest that these
operators are irrelevant for all N > 1.

Introduction and summary

Quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions (QED3) with N (two-component complex)

charged fermions can be shown to ﬂow to an interacting CFT perturbatively in the 1/N

expansion [1,2]. In this CFT, there are many quantities that have been computed to various

orders in 1/N . Examples include: the scaling dimensions of the lowest SU (N ) singlet scalars

[3–6], adjoints [7, 8], and a couple of other scalar operators [6]; the scaling dimensions of

monopole operators [9–11]; the two-point functions of the canonically-normalized stress-
energy tensor and of the conserved currents [12–14]; the S3 free energy [15]; as well as
various ﬁnite temperature quantities [8].1 Our goal here is to add to this list the scaling
dimensions of many more operators: For each SU (N ) irreducible representation with two

columns of ﬁxed lengths, we identify the 3 lowest-lying scalar operators with zero monopole

charge, and we compute their scaling dimensions to order 1/N .

Our interest in the scaling dimensions of scalar operators transforming in non-trivial

representations of SU (N ) comes in part from the recent conformal bootstrap study [19] of

QED3. This study focused on unitarity and crossing symmetry constraints on the four-point

function of monopole operators carrying a single unit of topological charge. The OPE of

such a monopole operator and its conjugate contains operators transforming under the ﬂavor

SU (N ) as precisely the irreps considered in this paper, namely two-column irreps of the form

In tensor notation, the irrep (1) can be represented as a traceless tensor

with n antisymmetric fundamental indices and n antisymmetric anti-fundamental indices.

While the bootstrap study [19] only examined relatively small values of N (namely N = 2, 4,

and 6), future studies may be able to access larger values of N , and in order to assess

their accuracy, one would beneﬁt from more large N analytical approximations than those

currently available in the literature. We thus develop the large N expansion for the scaling

dimensions of scalar operators transforming as (1) under SU (N ). Of course, such large

N expansions could also be useful independently of the conformal bootstrap program, for

instance if one engineers a new material that exhibits critical behavior described by QED3

with a suﬃciently large number of ﬂavors.

An additional motivation exists for computing the scaling dimensions of lowest-lying

parity even SU (N ) singlet operators. As we explain below, the lowest such operator has
scaling dimension approximately equal to 4 at N = ∞, with negative 1/N corrections. If
this operator becomes relevant at some ﬁnite value of N , it may completely change the

the scaling dimension of the lowest lying SU (N ) singlet approaches 3 [6, 16, 17]. Computing

this scaling dimensions as a function of N would allow us to estimate Ncrit.

Let us present a summary of our results. For any n ≥ 0, for which the SU (N ) irrep is
given by (1), we denote the lowest dimension operator by On. As we show in Section 3.1,
SU (N ) group theory requires that for n > 0, On must be constructed from a product
of precisely n distinct fermions anti-symmetrized in their SU (N ) indices and symmetrized

in their spinor indices and a product of n distinct anti-fermions with the same property.
Furthermore, only a single operator can be built in this way, namely2

where αm = 1, 2 are Lorentz spinor indices and im = 1, . . . , N are ﬂavor indices—see Section 2

for our conventions. This operator is parity even (odd) depending on whether n is even (odd).

We provide a formula for the scaling dimension ∆n of this operator to order 1/N in Eq. (55)

for all n > 0. This formula is rather complicated, so we record the scaling dimensions here
only for the ﬁrst several cases:3

Next, we consider the lowest dimension operator in the same SU (N ) irrep as On but with
opposite parity. For that purpose, we must consider an operator constructed with one more

of the validity range of our approximation—we ﬁrst ﬁx n and then take N to be large.

Extrapolating (7) to ﬁnite N , one ﬁnds that all parity-even SU (N ) singlets are irrelevant for

all values of N > 1. This result might suggest that the interacting CFT obtained in the 1/N

expansion extends to all values of N > 1, in agreement with the recent lattice simulations
of [20].6 It is worth mentioning that the scaling dimension of the four-fermion parity-even
singlet was also estimated from the 4 −  expansion in [16], where it was found that this
operator is irrelevant only for N > 2 [16]. It would be interesting to understand how the
mixing between the four-fermion operator and F 2
µν studied here aﬀects the 4 −  expansion
estimates.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we set up our conventions

and Feynman rules for QED3. Sections 3 and 4 contain the bulk of our computations.

2 Setup and conventions

Before we delve in the computations of the various scaling dimensions mentioned above, let

us describe our conventions and the setup of our computation. The Euclidean signature

Lagrangian of QED3 with N fermion ﬂavors is

L =

4e2 FµνF µν − ¯ψiγµ(∂µ + iAµ)ψi ,

where e is the gauge coupling. The gamma matrices obey the Cliﬀord algebra {γµ, γν} =
2δµνI and can be taken to be equal to the Pauli matrices γµ = σµ, for µ = 1, 2, 3. We choose
to write fundamental spinor indices as lower and fundamental SU (N ) indices as upper, as

indices are always summed over.

As will become clear shortly, the gauge coupling e drops out of all computations in the

IR CFT. Therefore, one can think of the fermions in (8) as carrying any gauge charge, and

not necessarily the smallest unit of charge allowed by the U (1) gauge symmetry. The results

of this paper are thus independent of the gauge charge of the fermions.

mixing of (cid:0) ¯ψiψi(cid:1)(cid:0) ¯ψjψj(cid:1) and (cid:0) ¯ψiγµψi(cid:1)(cid:0) ¯ψjγµψj(cid:1), we consider the mixing of (cid:0) ¯ψiψi(cid:1)(cid:0) ¯ψjψj(cid:1) and FµνF µν,

as we do in Section 4. Despite the diﬀerent methods, we obtain the same result as Ref. [6]. It would be
interesting to perform a similar computation to the one in this paper in the case of an SU (2) gauge theory
and compare with the results of [6].

6See, however, [21] where it was observed that for N = 2 there is spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.

Also, the F -theorem [17] implies that chiral symmetry breaking is ruled out for N ≥ 10.

(10)

The gauge-fermion vertex factor is simply iγµ. See Figure 1. Computing diagrams using
these rules is then straightforward. The IR CFT behavior can be extracted by taking the
limit of small external momenta. This limit is equivalent to taking e2 → ∞ in all correlation
functions because by dimensional analysis e2 always appears as e2/|p|, where p is one of the
external momenta.

Using the Feynman rules in Figure 1 is cumbersome for two reasons. The ﬁrst reason

is that at the CFT ﬁxed point the Maxwell term is irrelevant, so there should be a way of
performing the computation such that e2 never appears and no limit needs to be taken at
the end. In other words, there should be a way of performing the computation where the
e2 → ∞ limit is taken from the very beginning. The second reason is that at each order in
1/N there is an inﬁnite number of fermion bubble diagrams that always get resummed in

the same way, so one should resum them once and for all.

Let us address the second concern ﬁrst. In order to avoid resumming the same bubble

diagrams every time, one can deﬁne an eﬀective gauge ﬁeld propagator obtained after the

resummation. See Figure 2.

In order to obtain an explicit expression for the eﬀective

gauge propagator, it is convenient to work with the position-space fermion Green’s function

obtained by Fourier transforming (10):

Each fermion bubble is nothing but the two-point function of the gauge current jµ = ¯ψiγµψi;
in position space, it is

as follows from performing the required Wick contraction and using (11). Passing to mo-

(13)

as follows from the formulas given in (93). As deﬁned above, the eﬀective gauge ﬁeld prop-

agator is just the sum of the fermion bubbles and takes the form of a geometric series:

(14)

One can thus replace the gauge propagator (10) with (14) in order to not have to resum the

bubble diagrams every time, and otherwise compute Feynman diagrams as usual.

2.1.2 Feynman rules with non-standard gauge ﬁxing

As already mentioned, it would be nice to have a way of performing computations at the CFT
ﬁxed point without having to carry around e2 and to take the limit e2 → ∞ at the end of
the computation. Unfortunately, the Maxwell propagator (10) and the eﬀective propagator
(14) do not generally have ﬁnite limits as e2 → ∞, so this limit cannot in general be taken

7

≡µ+µνν+...µν+µν+at the beginning of the computation.

An exception occurs in the gauge ξ = 0, where the eﬀective gauge propagator (14) does
have a ﬁnite limit as e2 → ∞ and one can indeed take e2 → ∞ from the beginning. As we
now show, it is also possible to modify the gauge ﬁxing term (9) so as to have a one-parameter
family of gauge-ﬁxing terms, not just that for ξ = 0, for which one can take e2 → ∞ from
the beginning.

Instead of (9), one can consider the non-local gauge-ﬁxing term

where ζ is a gauge-ﬁxing parameter. Using (15) instead of (9), the Maxwell gauge ﬁeld

and the eﬀective gauge propagator in (14) gets replaced by

µν(p) =

16

N |p|(cid:18)δµν − ζ

pµpν

p2 (cid:19) + O(p2/e2) .

(17)

As advertised, this expression has a ﬁnite limit as e2 → ∞ for any ζ. Gauge invariant
observables should of course be independent of ζ.

where x12 ≡ x1 − x2 and the position space expression for Dµν is derived in (96). The vertex
factor is iγµ. See Figure 3.

In working with the eﬀective gauge ﬁeld propagator Dµν one should keep in mind that
this propagator stands for the sum of the bubble diagrams in Figure 2, so one should not

count the same Feynman diagram multiple times. In particular, one should not consider any

eﬀective gauge propagators renormalized by fermion bubbles, for instance as on the RHS of

Figure 2 if the dotted lines were replaced by wavy lines.

2.3 General strategy for anomalous dimension computation

In this paper, we compute anomalous dimensions from the matrix of two point functions in
1/N perturbation theory. Suppose that there are r operators Oa, a = 1, . . . , r that have the
same quantum numbers and scaling dimension ∆(0) at leading order in N . The matrix of
two-point functions has a large N expansion of the form

Mab(x) ≡ (cid:104)Oa(x) ¯Ob(0)(cid:105) = M(0)

ab (x) + M(1)

ab (x)

1
N

+ . . . .

We expect the following x dependence of the ﬁrst two coeﬃcients:

M(0)

ab (x) =

Nab

|x|2∆(0) , M(1)

ab (x) =

1

|x|2∆(0)(cid:2)−Mab log(|x|2 Λ2) + O(|x|0)(cid:3) .

(19)

(20)

This expression serves as a deﬁnition of the r × r matrices N and M. Here, Λ is the UV
cutoﬀ, which is required in order to make the argument of the logarithm dimenisonless. At
order 1/N the anomalous dimensions are the eigenvalues ∆(1)

a of the matrix

∆(1) = N−1M

(see for instance [22]). The total scaling dimensions are thus

2.4.1 Correction to fermion propagator

Because the gauge ﬁxing term (15) is conformally invariant, the two point function of ψ has

powerlaw decay for any ζ. However, the corresponding scaling dimension ∆ψ will depend on

ζ and does not have to obey the unitarity bound for a spin-1/2 operator. We have

3 Operators in representation (cid:0)1N−2n, 2n(cid:1)

In this section we consider the three lowest-lying scalar operators transforming in the irrep
(1N−2n, 2n) of SU (N ), with n > 0. For a Young diagram representation, see Eq. (1). In the
case n = 1, the lowest-lying operator is the 2-fermion adjoint discussed in Section 2.4.3.

3.1 Number of operators

The scalar operators in (cid:0)1N−2n, 2n(cid:1), being gauge invariant, must be constructed from an

equal number of ψ’s and ¯ψ’s. Let us count how many linearly independent operators we can
construct out of m ψ’s and m ¯ψ’s and determine the smallest value of m that is necessary
in order to be able to construct at least one such operator.

Let us consider the m ψ’s and the m ¯ψ’s separately at ﬁrst. The ψ’s transform as
fundamentals both under the ﬂavor group SU (N ) and the space-time group SU (2). Since

there are 2N such ψ’s, we can formally combine them in a fundamental vector of a larger

group SU (2N ), which is not a symmetry group of the theory but nevertheless a convenient

bookkeeping device. In terms of the product group SU (2N ), the product of m ψ’s, denoted
[ψ]m, transforms as (1m) because the ψ’s are all anti-commuting. The representation (1m)

11

of SU (2N ) decomposes under SU (2) × SU (N ) as

[ψ]m :

(1m) →

m/2(cid:77)j={m/2}(cid:0)(2j),(cid:0)12j, 2m/2−j(cid:1)(cid:1) ,

(28)

where {x} denotes the fractional part of x and (2j) denotes the spin-j irrep of SU (2). See
Figure 6. The product [ ¯ψ]m transforms in the representation conjugate to (28):

[ ¯ψ]m :

(1m) →

m/2(cid:77)j={m/2}(cid:16)(2j), (12j, 2m/2−j)(cid:17) .

Figure 6: Decomposition of [ψ]m under SU (2) × SU (N )

The product [ψ]m × [ ¯ψ]m transforms in a reducible representation of SU (2) × SU (N )
that can be obtained by simply multiplying (28) and (29). It contains operators with spin

ranging from 0 to m. The spin-0 operators appear only when multiplying a spin j irrep in

(28) with a spin j irrep in (29), and so they transform under SU (N ) as

(cid:2)[ψ]m × [ ¯ψ]m(cid:3)SU (2) singlets =

m/2(cid:77)j={m/2}(cid:104)(cid:0)12j, 2m/2−j(cid:1) ⊗ (12j, 2m/2−j)(cid:105) .

(30)

Each term in the sum (30) can be further decomposed as a sum of irreducible representa-

tions of SU (N ). Performing this decomposition is a straightforward group theory exercise,

and one can then count how many times the irrep(cid:0)1N−2n, 2n(cid:1) we are interested in appears
in this decomposition. The result is that if m < n, the irrep (cid:0)1N−2n, 2n(cid:1) does not appear
(cid:0)1N−2n, 2n(cid:1). If m = n, the irrep(cid:0)1N−2n, 2n(cid:1) appears in the decomposition of (30) only once,

at all: we need at least n ψ’s and n ¯ψ’s in order to construct an operator transforming in

and it comes from the term j = n/2; the corresponding operator can be written explicitly as

(31)

where we symmetrize and anti-symmetrized with unit weight, and the traces are over SU (N )

indices. This operator is non-zero only for 2n ≤ N . When m = n + 1, the irrep(cid:0)1N−2n, 2n(cid:1)

appears in (30) twice, once coming from j = m/2 and once form j = m/2 − 1. The

On = ψ[1

(α1

[n+1 . . . ¯ψαn)
¯ψ(α1

(33)

where the trace term in (31) does not contribute because all the ik are distinct. This operator

can be rewritten as

On = (−1)

n(n+1)

n! (cid:88)σ∈Sn

sig(σ)O(σ)

n (x) ,

n ≡ ¯ψn+1ψσ(1) . . . ¯ψ2nψσ(n) ,
O(σ)

(34)

where the spinor indices are contracted between adjacent fermions, and sig(σ) is the signature

of the permutation σ ∈ Sn. The conjugate of O(σ)

n

is

n ≡ ¯ψσ(1)ψn+1 . . . ¯ψσ(n)ψ2n .
¯O(σ)

We would like to express the two-point function of On as in Section 2.3. We have

(cid:104)On(x) ¯On(0)(cid:105) =

1

n! (cid:88)σ∈Sn

sig(σ)(cid:104)O(I)

n (x) ¯O(σ)

n (0)(cid:105) ,

(35)

(36)

where I is the identity permutation. Noticing that each permutation in a given conjugacy

class gives an equal contribution to the two-point function, we can express (36) as a sum

14

over conjugacy classes Cn,i of the symmetric group Sn:

(cid:104)On(x) ¯On(0)(cid:105) =

n! (cid:88)Cn,i∈Cl(Sn)

sig(Cn,i)|Cn,i|(cid:104)O(I)

(37)

Since conjugacy classes of the symmetric group Sn will appear several times in this

section, let us brieﬂy review their properties. Conjugacy classes of Sn are in one-to-one

correspondence with integer partitions of n. Suppose we write such an integer partition

corresponding to a conjugacy class Cn,i as

n =

n(cid:88)j=1

aijj ,

(38)

for some positive integers aij. All permutations in Cn,i have aij cycles of length j. In terms

of this data, the size and signature of Cn,i can be expressed as

there are several possibilities for where to draw the photon line:

There are 2j such diagrams for a permutation cycle of length j, for a total of 2n

diagrams. See Figure 7 for an example.

• the photon line can connect fermion lines belonging to diﬀerent cycles of Cn,i. These

diagrams cancel in pairs—See Figure 8.

• the photon line can connect distinct fermion lines of opposite types (one G(x, 0) and
one G(0, x)) within the same cycle of Cn,i. See the lefthand diagram in Figure 9. Let

this cycle have length k. In position space, such a diagram is

where the ﬁrst term in parentheses comes from the cycles without photon lines, and the

(45)

contribution we exhibited is that coming from the photon line. The number of fermion
propagators between those containing photon lines is k1 and k2, with k1 + k2 = k − 1.
• the photon line can connect distinct fermion lines of the same type (either both G(x, 0)
or both G(0, x)) within in the same cycle of Cn,i. See the righthand diagram in Figure 9.

For instance, if the photon line connects two G(x, 0)’s in a cycle of length k we have a

(46)

where again the ﬁrst term in parentheses comes from the cycles without photon lines,

and the contribution we exhibited is that coming from the photon line. Here, k1 + k2 =
k − 2.

From Dk and Ek we have to extract the logarithmic divergence. While these are very
complicated diagrams and their full evaluation would be an onerous task, the extraction of

the logarithmic divergence is quite easy, because it comes either from when z and w are both

close to x or to 0. Both limits give the same answer, so we can just take the limit where
both z and w are close to 0 and multiply the answer by 2. For Dk, Eq. (45) thus becomes

required gamma matrix algebra and using the gauge ﬁeld propagator in (18). Here, Λ is the
UV cutoﬀ and it must appear inside the logarithm in the combination Λ|x|. Thus, Dk(x)

evaluates to

limits when z, w go to x or 0, one obtains

Dk and k(k − 1) diagrams that give Ek. Along with the leg contributions, we have

function and the leading result as

This expression can be evaluated for any n using the data for the conjugacy classes of the
permutation group. When n = 1, one has only one conjugacy class C1 of size |C1| = 1 and
a11 = 1; it is easy to see that (55) reduces to (27).

The n-dependent prefactors in the second lines of (63) and (64) can be understood as
(cid:48)
follows. In the case where ψk and ¯ψk belong to O
n, we either have that ψk can be contracted
with ¯ψk, or ψk and ¯ψk can be part of a bigger cycle. Out of (n + 1)! total possibilities,
the ﬁrst case occurs n! times, while the latter occurs n!n times and has an extra factor of
−1/2 relative to the ﬁrst, because there is one fewer trace and permutation for this diagram.
Summing both cases we ﬁnd that whenever O

4 The mixing of lowest parity-even SU (N ) singlets

We now consider the parity-even SU (N ) singlets. At large N , all these operators are irrele-

vant. As mentioned in the Introduction, it is important to estimate down to what value of

N this situation persists, because if a parity-even SU (N ) singlet becomes relevant, it can be

generated during the RG ﬂow and change the fate of the infrared physics.

At inﬁnite N , there are two lowest-dimension parity even operators that mix in 1/N

perturbation theory. They are

O1 =

1
N

( ¯ψiψi)( ¯ψjψj) ,

O2 =

N
4

FµνF µν ,

(69)

where the factors of N have been chosen such that the two-point functions of these operators
scale as N 0 at large N . Both operators in (69) are real, and their scaling dimension is ∆0 = 4
at N = ∞.

23

Figure 11: Cancelation of diagrams contributing to (cid:104)O3(x)O3(0)(cid:105) at order N 0.

Before we start calculating the mixing between these two operators, let us explain why

there are only two such operators. The counting argument of Section 3.1 implies that there

are actually two linearly-independent four-fermion operators that are SU (N ) singlets. They
N ( ¯ψiγµψi)( ¯ψjγµψj). However, O3 is proportional to the large
can be taken to be O1 and O3 = 1
N equation of motion operator Eµ = ¯ψiγµψi = 0 of the large N theory obtained by varying
the action with respect to Aµ. As such, O3 does not contribute to the matrix of two-point
functions. Indeed, it can be checked that at separated points we have (cid:104)O3(x)O3(0)(cid:105) = 0.
For instance, at order N 0, the diagrams in Figure 11 can be seen to cancel exactly.7

Let us thus focus on the matrix of two-point functions of Oi, with i = 1, 2 and write it
at large N in the form given in Section 2.3. In particular, let us compute the matrices M
and N deﬁned in (20).

At leading order in N , we have

(cid:104)O1(x)O1(0)(cid:105)(0) = 2 tr [G(x, 0)G(0, x)] tr [G(x, 0)G(0, x)] =

(cid:104)O2(x)O2(0)(cid:105)(0) = 3

π4 |x|8 .

(72)

Since at order N 0, the two-point function (cid:104)O1(x)O2(0)(cid:105)(0) vanishes, the matrix N deﬁned in
(20) is

N =

π4(cid:32) 1

3 × 512(cid:33) .

(73)

In order to compute M, it is natural to think of each O1 as a composite between ¯ψiψi
and ¯ψjψj, and of O2 as the composite between Fµν and F µν. There are many diagrams that
contribute to M but they can be split into diagrams referred to as leg corrections coming

from each of the factors of the composites as well as diagrams referred to as vertex corrections

that mix together the two factors.

The leg correction diagrams have already been computed. Since the operator ¯ψiψi ac-
quires an anomalous dimension given by 128/(3π2N ) + O(1/N 2) (see (6)) and Fµν has no
anomalous dimension, we have that the leg contribution to M is

Mleg =

(74)

Let us now compute the leading vertex corrections. The two-point function (cid:104)O1(x) ¯O1(0)(cid:105)
does not receive any such corrections. (The diagrams cancel in pairs as in Figure 8.) On the
other hand, (cid:104)O1(x) ¯O2(0)(cid:105) = (cid:104)O2(x) ¯O1(0)(cid:105) and (cid:104)O2(x) ¯O2(0)(cid:105) might.

Let’s start with (cid:104)O1(x) ¯O2(0)(cid:105) (bottom diagram in Figure 12). In position space, this

(75)

µ(w, x))

As in the previous sections, we are content with extracting only the logarithmic divergence

of this diagram, leaving its full evaluation to future work. The log divergences come from

the ﬁnal answer and can be dropped.) In (80), the x dependence appears only implicitly as

where the third and fourth lines represent the contributions of the top left and top right

we can consider the case when they’re close to 0 and multiply the answer by 2. Expanding
