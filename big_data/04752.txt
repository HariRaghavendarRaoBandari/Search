Eﬀects of number scaling on entangled states in quantum

mechanics

ABSTRACT

A summary of number structure scaling is followed by a description of the eﬀects of number scaling in nonrel-
ativistic quantum mechanics. The description extends earlier work to include the eﬀects on the states of two
or more interacting particles. Emphasis is placed on the eﬀects on entangled states. The resulting scaling ﬁeld
is generalized to describe the eﬀects on these states. It is also seen that one can use ﬁber bundles with ﬁbers
associated with single locations of the underlying space to describe the eﬀects of scaling on arbitrary numbers
of particles.

Keywords: number structure scaling, ﬁber bundles, entangled states

1. INTRODUCTION

In earlier work1–3 the eﬀect of scaling of number systems on some quantities in physics and geometry was
described. The eﬀect appears in the form of a scalar scaling ﬁeld that appears in any physical quantity described
as an integral or derivative over space and or time. In quantum mechanics this includes the momentum operator
as a space derivative, id/dx and wave functions of particles.

The work is based on the description of mathematical systems of diﬀerent types as structures and relations
between the structures.4–6 Structures consist of a base set, a few basic operations and relations, and none or a
few constants. They satisfy axioms relevant to the system type being considered. The existence of the scaling
ﬁeld is based on the observation that number structures of each type can be scaled by arbitrary scaling factors.
As a result the elements of the base set of a number structure of a given type, (natural Integer, rational, real
complex numbers) by themselves have no value. They acquires value only as numbers in a structure. Their value
depends on the scaling of the structure.

The scaling used here is linear in that the numbers in a scaled structure are all multiplied by a single scaling
factor. Recently a more general type of number scaling has been described and applied to fractal quantities.7, 8
Here linear scaling will continue to be used because it is clearer and easier to understand.

Fiber bundles9 are used to describe the eﬀects of the scaling ﬁeld in quantum mechanics. The base space
or manifold, M , of the ﬁber bundle is 3 dimensional Euclidean space. For nonrelativistic quantum mechanics
the ﬁber contains structures for complex numbers and Hilbert spaces and a representation of M . The scalar
scaling ﬁeld appears in the ﬁber bundle approach as a connection between the ﬁbers at diﬀerent locations in M .
It connects or relates the components of ﬁbers at diﬀerent M locations. It plays an essential role in quantities
described by integrals or derivatives on M .

The use of ﬁber bundles to describe nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is not new.11–15 The quantum
descriptions include an introductory description,13 a detailed mathematical development14 and descriptions in
which symmetry groups and semigroups serve as the base space.12, 15

So far the eﬀect of the scaling ﬁeld in quantum mechanics has been limited to descriptions for single particle
wave functions.16 Here this description is extended to quantum mechanical descriptions of multiparticle wave
functions, particularly those entangled in space degrees of freedom. As will be seen, this requires an expansion
of the description of the scaling ﬁeld and a change in the used of ﬁber bundles.

The plan of this work is to review number scaling. this is done in the next section. This is followed by a
section giving basic details on ﬁber bundles and connections. Next comes a description of single particle quantum
mechanics. This is followed by the new material on two and multiparticle quantum mechanics.

2. NUMBER SCALING

The scaling of numbers is a simple concept. It is easiest to see for the natural numbers. One notes that the
natural numbers, 0, 1, 2,··· can be characterized as a set N that is discretely well ordered with no greatest
element. The values of the ﬁrst and second element in the well ordering are 0 and 1. Let N2 be the set of every
other element of N . The ﬁrst element of N2 has value 0 and the second element has value 1. However the second
element in N2 has value 2 in N. One sees that the value of the second element of N depends on whether it is
considered as an element of N or of N2.

This argument extends to any pair, Nm, Nn of subsets consisting of every mth and nth element of N . Let n
be a factor of m. Then Nm is a subset of Nn. Let j be an element of Nm. The value j in Nm is related to that
in Nn by

mvm(j) = nvn(j).

(1)

Here vn and vm are value functions that assign well ordering values to numbers in Nn and Nm.

Eq. 1 shows that elements of Nm do not have intrinsic values of their own. Their values depend on the subset
and the well ordering of the subset containing them. For natural numbers this is restricted to all and only those
subsets, Nn where m is a factor of n.

These results also apply to the other types of numbers, The scaling for rational, real, and complex numbers
diﬀers from that of the natural numbers in that the base set of numbers is the same for any scaling factor. This
is a consequence of the fact that these numbers are closed under division.

Since the main concern here is the eﬀect of scaling on quantum mechanics, the number type is limited to
complex numbers. A discussion of number scaling for complex numbers is followed by a short discussion of the
eﬀect of number scaling on Hilbert spaces.

2.1 Complex numbers

The usual structure for complex numbers is given as

¯C = {C,±,×,÷,∗ , 0, 1}.

(2)

Here ∗ denotes complex conjugation. The structure is required to satisfy the axioms requiring that ¯C is an
algebraically complete ﬁeld of characteristic 0.17

Let c and d be complex scaling factors. Deﬁne ¯Cc and ¯Cd to be complex number structures associated with

c and d. The structure components are given by

¯Cc = {B,±c×c,÷c,∗c , 0c, 1c}
¯Cd = {B,±d×d,÷d,∗d , 0d, 1d}.

(3)

The common base set for both structures is denoted by B. The subscripts c and d indicate structure membership.
Thus 1c and 1d are numbers in B that have value 1 in ¯Cc and ¯Cd.

It is useful to let ¯C denote a single complex number value structure. Elements of the base set C in ¯C are
number values. One can then deﬁne bijective isomorphic value maps, vc and vd from ¯Cc and ¯Cd to ¯C. For any
number b in B vc(b) and vd(b) are the values b has in ¯C. vc(b) and vd(b) can also be interpreted as the values b
has in ¯Cc and ¯Cd. The properties of value maps are given by

vc(s ±c t) = vc(s) ± vc(t), vc(s ×c t) = vc(s) × vc(t),

vc(s ÷c t) = vc(s) ÷ vc(t), vc(t∗c) = (vc(t))∗.

(4)

Numbers in B can also be described using the inverses of the value maps. For example, 1c = v−1

c (1) and
d (1). In general any number written with a scale factor subscript, as in ad, has the value a in ¯Cd. If c 6= d

1d = v−1
then the numbers ad and ac are diﬀerent. This is the case even though they have the same value in ¯C.

The relation between the values, in ¯Cc and ¯Cd, of a number in B is given by an equation similar to Eq. 1.

One has

dvd(b) = cvc(b).

The relationship between the numbers in B that have the same value in ¯Cc and ¯Cd is given by

vd(b) =

c
d

vc(b) = vc(

cc
dc

b).

(5)

(6)

Here cc and dc are the numbers in B with c values, c and d in ¯C. This equation shows the eﬀect of moving scaling
factors, as number values outside the value function, to numbers inside the value function. Eq. 6 can also be
written in the equivalent form,

vc(b) =

vd(b) = vd(

b).

(7)

d
c

dd
cd

These equations show clearly that the elements of the base set, by themselves, have no value. They acquire
value only as elements of the base set in a structure. The value of an element depends on the scaling factor of
the structure containing it. There is also a separation between operations on numbers and operations on number
values. For example the number multiplications and divisions in the term, (cc/dc)b, are in ¯Cc. The multiplication
and division in (c/d)vc(b) are in ¯C.

Some words about the nomenclature used here and in the following are in order. Structures will always be
designated by an overline as in ¯Cc. Base sets are without an overline as in B.∗ Also elements of base sets of
complex or any other number type, are referred to as numbers. This distinguishes numbers from number values.
These are the values numbers have in a structure.

Two representation of base set numbers are used. One is in the form of a single letter as b is used in Eqs. 6
and 7. The other is as a subscripted letter or number as in ad. ad is the base set number that has value a in ¯Cd.
1c and 1d are the numbers with value 1 in ¯Cc and ¯Cd. But 1c is a diﬀerent number from 1d.

The relation between ad and ac is obtained from

vd(ad) = vc(ac) = a

and Eqs. 6 and 7. One has

vd(ad) =

c
d

vc(ad) = vc(

cc
dc

ad) = vc(ac) =

d
c

vd(ac) = vd(

dd
cd

ac).

From this equation one gets

Since vc is an isomorphism,

vc(ad) =

d
c

vc(ac) = vc(

dc
cc

ac).

ad =

dc
cc

ac.

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

Note that the scaled structure ¯C1 is distinct from ¯C. If scaling is suppressed, then ¯C1, as the only scaled

structure, can be identiﬁed with ¯C. This is the usual treatment of numbers in mathematics and physics.

Let s and t be two numbers in B. If both are in the same scaled structure, such as ¯Cc, then implementing
the four ﬁeld operations, and complex conjugation, on the two numbers is well deﬁned. Suppose, though, that s
is a number in ¯Cc and t is a number in ¯Cd. Field operations are not deﬁned for these numbers as the operations
are deﬁned only within structures, not between structures. One can deﬁne the operations on the values of the
numbers. If Op denotes any of the four ﬁeld operations, then vc(s)Opvd(t) is the resulting value of implementing
Op on vc(s) and vd(t). This is a diﬀerent value from vc(s)Opvc(t) as

∗The letter B is used instead of C to distinguish it from the base set of ¯C.

vc(s)Opvc(t) = vc(s)Op(

d
c

)vd(t).

(12)

Maps that take the components of one scaled structure into those of another play an important role in what
follows. There are two types of maps. The usual type is a value preserving number changing map of ¯Cd onto ¯Cc
This map is deﬁned by ad → ac and Opd = Opc. Axiom validity is preserved under this map, ¯Cd → ¯Cc.

The other type of map is a number preserving, value changing map. This is the map type studied here. The
eﬀect of the map is to represent operations in one structure in terms of those in another structure in such a way
that axiom validity is preserved.

Let Z d

c be such a number preserving isomorphic map of the components of ¯Cd onto those of ¯Cc. It is deﬁned

by

Z d

c (s) = s, Z d

c (±d) = ±c, Z d

c (÷d) = ( dc
Z d

cc ÷c), Z d

c (s∗d ) = dc
cc

dc×c),

c (×d) = ( cc
(s∗c).

(13)

(14)

(15)

The multiplications and divisions implied in this deﬁnition are all in ¯Cc. The representation of base set numbers
as dc and cc means that these are base set complex numbers with values d and c in ¯Cc. The scaling of the
multiplication and division operations is needed to preserve axiom validity.

The deﬁnition of Z d

c can be used to deﬁne a new structure, ¯Cd

c , that gives the components of ¯Cd in terms of

those of Cc. The new structure is

Z d
c

¯Cd = ¯Cd
c

where

¯Cd
c = {B,±c, (

cc
dc ×c), (

dc
cc ÷c),

dc

(s∗c), 0d, 1d} = {B,±c, (

cc
dc ×c), (

dc
cc ÷c),

dc
cc

(s∗c),

dc
cc

0c,

dc
cc

1c}.

The validity of the complex number axioms for ¯Cd

c follows from Eqs. 7 and 13.

Let s and t be two numbers in B, Then

vd(s ±d t) = vd(s)vd(+d)vd(t) = vc( dc
vd(s ×d t) = vd(s)vd(×d)vd(t) = vc( dc
Z d
vd(s ÷d t) = vd(s)vd(÷d)vd(t) = vc( dc

c vc(t)) = d

c vc(s ×c t)

c vc(t)) = d

c vc(s ÷c t).

(16)

The fact that the values of the basic terms all scale by the same factor means that all equations are preserved
under the map from ¯Cd to ¯Cd
c . This occurs because the terms on both sides of an equation are multiplied by
the same scaling factor. The map Z d
c and the relations among the value maps show that with one exception
that values of all numbers are scaled. The one exception is the number 0. The value of this number remains the
same under all scalings. This is the only number which can be identiﬁed with its value. In a sense it acts like
the number vacuum.

2.2 Hilbert spaces

Hilbert spaces as vector spaces over the complex number ﬁeld are aﬀected by complex number scaling. In general
the setup is similar to that for the complex numbers. The space, ¯H, where

¯H = {H,±,·,h−,−i, ψ},

(17)

represents a vector value structure for Hilbert spaces. H is a set of vector values, ±,·, and h−,−i denote linear
superposition, scalar vector multiplication and a scalar product. Also ψc and ψd denote vectors with the value ψ
in ¯H. Here ψ is an arbitrary vector value. The dimension of ¯H is arbitrary, ﬁnite or denumerable. The structure,
¯C is the scalar ﬁeld for ¯H.

The Hilbert space structures associated with ¯Cc and ¯Cd as scalars are given by

¯H c = {Hc,±c,·c,h−,−ic, ψc},

(18)

and

(19)
As was the case for the complex numbers the base vector sets, Hc and Hd are the same, as Hc = Hd. ¯H c, ¯H d, ¯H
are all required to satisfy the relevant axioms for Hilbert spaces.

¯H d = {Hd,±d,·d,h−,−id, ψd}.

Value maps can also be deﬁned for Hilbert spaces. They are similar to those for the complex numbers. One

has for any vector φ in Hc = Hd,

From Eq. 6 one has

The vectors ψc and ψd in Hc = Hd satisfy

cvc(φ) = dvd(φ).

vd(φ) =

c
d

vc(φ) = vc(

cc
dc

φ).

vd(ψd) = vc(ψc) = ψ.

The vectors ψc and ψd diﬀer only by scaling factors. This can be seen from

vd(ψd) =

c
d

vc(ψd) = vc(

cc
dc

ψd) = vc(ψc) =

d
c

vd(ψc) = vd(

dd
cd

ψc).

This equation gives

vc(ψd) =

d
c

vc(ψc) = vc(

dc
cc

ψc).

Since the value functions are isomorphic maps, one has

ψd =

dc
cc

ψc.

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

These results show that vectors in ¯H d and ¯H c diﬀer by scaling factors only. The projection of the components

of ¯H d onto those of ¯H c is similar to that for the complex numbers. The vector structure ¯H d

c is given by

¯H d
c = {Hc,±c, (

cc
dc ·c),

dc
cc hφ, ρic,

dc
cc

ψc}.

(26)

Here φ and ρ are arbitrary vectors in Hc = Hd. Also ψd is an arbitrary vector in Hd. This shows that the
projection of the components of ¯H d onto those of ¯H c multiplies a vector by the number factor dc/cc. The scalar
cc hφ, ρic, is the same number as is hφ, ρid. Both have value hφ, ρi in ¯Cd. The value of hφ, ρid
product component, dc
in ¯Cc is (d/c)hφ, ρi.

3.1 Fiber bundles

3. FIBER BUNDLES AND CONNECTIONS

Fiber bundles play an important role in many areas of physics. They have also been used to describe some
aspects of quantum mechanics.11–15 They will be used here to describe the eﬀects of number scaling on quantum
states.

A ﬁber bundle consists of a triple, E, π, M where E is the total space, M is the base space, and π is the
projection of E onto M .9 Often M is taken to be a space, time or space time manifold. Since the discussion will
be limited to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, M is taken to be 3 dimensional Euclidean space.

In this case the ﬁber bundle becomes a trivial or product bundle where E = M × F . Here F is the ﬁber.

The inverse of π deﬁnes the ﬁber at point x of M by the relation

π−1(x) = (x, F ) = Fx.

(27)

Fibers can contain many diﬀerent types of mathematical systems. Here the ﬁber F contains pairs of Hilbert
spaces and complex number structures for all scaling factors and a chart representation of M as φ(M ) = R3.
The resulting ﬁber bundle is deﬁned by

The ﬁber at point x of M is given by

CHM∪ = M ×[c

( ¯Cc × ¯H c) × R3, π, M.

π−1(x) = Fx = [c

( ¯Cc

x × ¯H c

x) × R3
x.

(28)

(29)

The structures ¯Cc and ¯H c are given by Eqs. 3 and 18. The subscript, x denotes local representations of these
structures at point x of M .

A structure group G is associated with the bundle. For each nonzero complex number value d the G group

element, Wd, acts on the ﬁber according to

Wd( ¯Cc × ¯H c) = ¯Cdc × ¯H dc.

(30)

The group, G, is commutative and associative. It also acts freely and transitively on the ﬁber.

The presence of the structure group with these properties implies that CHM∪ is a principal ﬁber bundle.18

Structures at all levels c in the ﬁber, F , are equivalent. No one is to be preferred over another.

3.2 Connections

Fields in physics can be represented as sections over the ﬁber bundle. If β is a scalar section then for each x β(x)
is a complex number in ¯Ccx
x . If the level cx is independent
of x, then the section is a level section.

x . If β is a vector section, then β(x) is a vector in ¯H cx

Physical quantities such as integrals or derivatives of β over M are not deﬁned. The reason is that mathe-
matical combinations of quantities in ﬁbers at diﬀerent locations or levels are not deﬁned. This is remedied by
the use of connections. These map the contents of a ﬁber at one point to those at another point.

There are diﬀerent ways to deﬁne connections. Here the deﬁnition begins with a complex scalar ﬁeld, g, over

M . This ﬁeld induces a structure-group ﬁeld, Wg, over M where for each x in M and scaling factor c,

Wg(x)( ¯Cc

x × ¯H c

x) = ¯Cg(x)c

x

× ¯H g(x)c

x

.

(31)

Let βg,c be a vector section over M where for each x βg,c(x) is a vector in ¯H g(x)c

x

then βg,c(x) is a scalar in ¯Cg(x)c
that corresponds to βg,c(y) in ¯Cg(y)c

x

y

or ¯H g(y)c

y

is given by

. Let y and x be two points on M . The number or vector in ¯Cg(x)c

. If βg,c is a scalar section,
or ¯H g(x)c

x

x

Cg(x, y)βg,c(y) = Z g(y)

g(x)V (x, y)βg,c(y) = Z g(y)

g(x)βg,c(y)x =

g(y)g(x)
g(x)g(x)

βg,c(y)x.

(32)

The operator V (x, y) maps a complex number Hilbert space pair at any level in Fy to a pair at the same

level in Fx. That is

V (x, y)( ¯Cg(y)c

y

× ¯H g(y)c

y

) = ¯Cg(y)c

x

× ¯H g(y)c

x

.

The operator Z g(y)

g(x) is an extension of the deﬁnition in Eq. 13 to include Hilbert spaces as in

Z g(y)
g(x)( ¯Cg(y)

x × ¯H g(y)

x

) = ¯Cg(y)

g(x),x × ¯H g(y)
g(x),x.

(33)

(34)

The pair, ¯Cg(y)
as the results are independent of the value of c.

g(x),x and ¯H g(y)

g(x),x are described by Eqs. 15 and 26. Here and in the following c will be set equal to 1

4. SINGLE PARTICLE QUANTUM MECHANICS

4.1 Position space representation

The usual position space expression for a single particle wave packet is

ψ = Z ψ(x)|xidx.

(35)

Since the concepts of number and number value, and vector and vector value are conﬂated, there is no reason to
distinguish them. This is the usual approach. This is a special case of the number scaling where g is a constant
ﬁeld with value 1. One can also regard Eq. 35 as a global expression because the mathematics used to describe
the integral is global. It is not located anywhere in M . It is outside of space and time.

One can also use local mathematics to describe the wave packet. This is done by use of the ﬁber bundle. The

wave packet in the ﬁber F at level, c is described by

ψc = Z ψ(x)c|xicdx

(36)

where the integral is over all points in R3. The complex number ψ(x)c and the vector, |xic have values ψ(x) and
|xi in ¯Cc and ¯H c.

This is similar to a global representation of the vector, ψc as there is no reference to mathematical systems
at points of M . The corresponding local representations are those in the ﬁbers at each point of M . The
representation at point x is given by

ψc,x = Zx

ψ(y)c,x|yic,xdy
x and ¯H c

(37)

The pair ψc,x(y) and |yic,x are numbers and vectors in ¯Cc
that the integral is over all points in R3
all equivalent.

x. The subscript x on the integral indicates
x. The representations at diﬀerent points of M and diﬀerent levels, c, are

In the following c will be set equal to 1. It will be retained as a subscript where needed to distinguish numbers

and vectors from number values and vector values.

There is another way to describe the wave packet in the ﬁber bundle. To achieve this it is useful to express

the wave packet, ψ in the form as

ψ = Z ψ(x)|xidx = Z λ(x)dx.

(38)

Here λ is considered as a vector ﬁeld over M . As such it is raised to be a section on the ﬁber bundle. In the
absence of scaling λ(x) is a vector in ¯H 1
x.

The integral in the deﬁnition in Eq. 38 is not deﬁned as the integrands are in Hilbert spaces at diﬀerent
M locations. This can be ﬁxed by choice of a reference location, x in M and using the connection to parallel
transform the integrand to a Hilbert space in Fx. With no scaling the connection C(x, y) = V (x, y) as the Z
operator in Eq. 32 is the identity. In this case

C(x, y)λ(y) = V (x, y)λ(y) = λ(y)x.

(39)

Here λ(y)x is the same vector in ¯H 1

x as λ(y) is in ¯H 1y.

To complete the process one should describe the collection of vectors λ(y)x by an equivalent local ﬁeld over
x and replacing the integration variable y by

x. This corresponds to the lifting of the domain of λ from M to R3

R3
its chart value φx(y) = zy in R3
x.

The resulting expression for wave packet ψx is well deﬁned in the ﬁber at x as

ψx = Zx

ψ(zy)x|zyixdzy.

(40)

This integral, as a vector in ¯H 1

x, has the same value as does the global expression of Eq. 35.

In the presence of scaling the values are not the same. For each y in M , λg(y) is a vector in ¯H g(y)

y

connection is needed to parallel transform each λg(y) to a vector in the reference Hilbert space, ¯H g(x)

with

Deﬁning ψg,x as an integral over R3

x requires lifting the domains of g and λ from M to R3

x. The resulting

expression for ψg,x, as an integral in Fx is

ψg,x = Zx

gx(z)g(x)
gx(zx)g(x)

ψ(z)g(x)|zig(x)dz.

The relation between gx and g is given by

Here zy is the chart value in R3

x of y in M .

gx(zy) = g(y).

(42)

(43)

Since gx(zx)g(x) is independent of the integration variable, it can be moved outside the integral to obtain,

ψg,x =

1

gx(zx)g(x) Zx

gx(z)g(x)ψg(z)x|zig(x)dz.

(44)

In general the presence of the scaling factor means that the vector value of ψg,x is diﬀerent from that in the
absence of scaling. However the two values coincide if the scaling factor g is a constant independent of location.

It is useful to express g as the exponential of a complex scalar ﬁeld as in

The eﬀect of scaling can be described in terms of either the g ﬁeld or the γ ﬁeld.

Use of Eq. 45 in Eq. 44 gives

g(y) = eγ(y).

ψg,x = (e−γx(zx))g(x)Rx(eγx(z))g(x)ψ(z)g(x)|zig(x)dz

= (e−γx(zx))g(x)Rx dz|zig(x)hz|(eγx)g(x)ψg(x)ig(x).

4.2 Momentum space representation

The above representation of scaled quantum states for single particles is a space representation. It is a consequence
of representing a quantum state as a section over a ﬁber bundle based on position space. As is well known quantum
states of particles have either position or momentum representations. Both are equivalent.

A possible way to represent this using ﬁber bundles is to expand the base space M to be the product of
three dimensional momentum space and position space as in M = P × X. The corresponding ﬁber bundle is an
expansion of Eq. 28 to

CHPX∪ = (P × X) ×[c

( ¯Cc × ¯H c) × R3

P × R3

X , π, P × X.

(47)

Here R3

P and R3

X are chart representations of P and X.

Quantum states can have either position representations or momentum representations. Unlike classical states
they cannot have combined position and momentum representations. A quantum state amplitude cannot be a
function of both position and momentum. It follows from this that quantum states as sections on a ﬁber bundle
can be either position space sections or momentum space sections. A quantum state cannot be both a position
and a momentum based section.

This can be accommodated in the ﬁber bundle by replacing the full projection, π by two marginal projections,
πX and πP . πX does not act on P and πP does not act on X. The inverses of these projections deﬁne ﬁbers at
position and momentum space representations. One has

X (x) = [c

x,X = Fx

Position state representations of quantum states can be implemented as sections on the ﬁber bundle, CHPX∪
by replacing π by πX . This is what has been done so far. Momentum state representations can be implemented as
sections on the ﬁber bundle with πP replacing π. However momentum state representations can also be described
in the ﬁbers Fx just as position state representations can be described in the ﬁbers Fp. Here the discussion will
be limited to describing momentum state representations in Fx.

The momentum representation of the state ψg,x as a vector in ¯H g(x)

x

in Fx is obtained in the usual way from

Eq. 46. One obtains

ψg,x = (e−γx(zx))g(x)Rx dp|pig(x)hp|eγxψig(x)

= (e−γx(zx))g(x) RxRx dpdq|pig(x)hp|eγx|qig(x)hq|ψig(x).

The momentum amplitude, hp|eγx|qig(x) can be expanded to
hp|eγx|qi = Zxhp|zieγx(z)hz|qidz = Zx

The subscript g(x) has been removed to indicate that the factors, with subscripts as complex numbers in ¯Cg(x)
or vectors in ¯H g(x)
, have, as values, the factors without subscripts. Eq. 51 is an equation in quantity values in
the ﬁber at x. In the following the subscript g(x) be suppressed for the same reason.

These results show that in the momentum representation the product of the scaling factor and the wave
vector is present as a convolution integral over an intermediate momentum. This quite diﬀerent from the space
representation in which the scaling factor and wave vector are present as a product.

The eﬀect of the momentum operator, ˜px, on ψg,x is expressed in the ﬁber Fx. For the momentum represen-

tation of ψg,x as in Eq. 50 one has

˜pxψg,x = (e−γx(zx))Zx

p|pihp|eγxψidp.

The action of ˜px on the space representation of ψg,x in the ﬁber at x is obtained from Eq. 46. One has

Eq. 53 shows that

˜pxψg,x = (i)(e−γx(zx))Rx

˜px(eγx(z)ψ(z)|zi) = eγx(z)(˜px(z) + iΓx(z))ψ(z)|zi.

(52)

(53)

(54)

In these expressions Γx is the gradient of γx as in

Γx(z) = ∇zγx(z).

(55)

This result shows that the eﬀect of the localization of a global expression of a wave packet as an integral of
a section, in the presence of a varying scaling ﬁeld, introduces a vector ﬁeld as a momentum component. With
no ﬁeld Γ present, the equation is the usual expression for action of the momentum operator on the wave packet
expressed directly as an integral over R3
x. Note that if γ is a constant ﬁeld, then the usual expression is recovered
as Γ = 0.

These results can be used to determine the eﬀect of scaling on the single particle Hamiltonian. The position

representation of the Hamiltonian as an operator on the states in ¯H g(x)

x

in the ﬁber Fx is given by

˜Hx(z) = ˜Kx(z) + ˜Vx(z) =

The factor e−γx(zx) has been left out because it is in eﬀect a ﬁber normalizing constant and the Hamiltonian
does not act on it. The kinetic energy can also be expressed as ˜Kx = p2

One notes that the eigenvalue equation for the Hamiltonian is given by

˜Hxψx = Eψx.

(59)

(60)

The exponential scaling factors do not appear as they cancel from both sides of the equation. The eﬀect of
scaling is already included in the kinetic energy operator.

5. TWO OR MORE PARTICLE QUANTUM MECHANICS

5.1 Two or more noninteracting particles

Quantum mechanics of two or more particles requires changes in the ﬁber bundle framework and in the eﬀects
of the scaling ﬁeld. For two independent particles that do not interact with one another one can start with two
separate ﬁber bundles, one for each particle. Bundles for particles 1 and 2 would be

CHR1 = M, F1, π1, M and CHR2 = M, F2, π2, M.

(61)

In the absence of scaling F1 = ¯C × ¯H1 × R3 × P3. F2 diﬀers only in replacing ¯H1 with ¯H2.

A product of the bundles can be deﬁned by

π1 and π2 are projection maps from M, F1 to M and M, F2 to M , The inverse maps are given by

CHR12 = M, (F1 × F2), π1 × π2, M.

1 (x) = ¯Cx, ¯H1,x, P3
π−1

x, R3
x

2 (y) = ¯Cy, ¯H2,y, P3
π−1

y, R3
y.

(62)

(63)

One can deﬁne wave packet states for particles 1 and 2 directly in ﬁbers F1,x and F2,y by ψ1,x = Rx ψ1(z)|zidz
and ψ2,y = Ry ψ2(u)|uidu. Taking a direct product of these states is not meaningful because the states are in

ﬁbers at diﬀerent locations. This can be remedied by restricting consideration to particle 1 and 2 ﬁbers at the
same location, x. Then the direct product of F1,x and F2,x can be expressed as

F1,x × F2,x = F1,2.x = ¯Cx, ¯H1,x × ¯H2,x, P3

x, R3
x.

(64)

The product state ψ1 × ψ2 is a state in the product Hilbert space.

The introduction of scaling follows that described for single particle states. The scaling ﬁeld is the same for

both particles. It aﬀects the state for each particle just as it does for the single particle state.

This description extends to a descriptions of the quantum states of n noninteracting particles. The product

of two ﬁber bundles as in Eq. 62 is extended to an n fold product as in

CHR1,n = M, (×n

j=1Fj),×n

j=1πj, M.

The inverse projection map for particle j is given by

π−1
j

(xj ) = ¯Cxj , ¯Hj,xj , P3

xj , R3
xj

(65)

(66)

The ﬁber associated with the n fold product of the inverses of the πj is a ﬁber associated with n diﬀerent

locations in M as in

Fx1,··· ,n = ×n

j=1Fxj .

(67)

As was the case for two particle states, one can deﬁne wave packet states for the jth particle in Fxj . However
one cannot take a direct product of these states for diﬀerent j because they are in ﬁbers at diﬀerent locations of
M .

This can be ﬁxed by restricting the xj to be the same, as in xj = x for all j. Then the ﬁbers all coalesce into

a ﬁber at one point, x, as in

Fx = ¯Cx ×n

j=1

¯Hx,j × R3

x × P3
x.

(68)

The projection operator, π projects onto single points of M with π−1(x) = Fx.

5.2 Two interacting particles

This ﬁber bundle framework for a description of the quantum mechanics of two or more noninteracting free
particles does not work for the description of states of two or more interacting particles or or those in entangled
states. A simple example of such a state is a two particle Slater determinant state

ψ1,2(x, y) =

1
√2

(ψ1(x)ψ2(y) − ψ1(y)ψ2(x)).

The two particle state vector for such entangled states is

ψ1,2 = Z ψ1,2(x, y)|x, yidxdy.

(69)

(70)

The methods used to include the eﬀects of scaling begin with the representation of the integrand of Eq. 70

as a vector ﬁeld as in

ψ1,2 = Z λ1,2(x, y)dxdy.

(71)

The vector ﬁeld can be described as a section on an appropriately deﬁned ﬁber bundle. Connections are used to
parallel transform the section values at diﬀerent ﬁber locations to a common location. Integrals of the transformed
section are well deﬁned with the ﬁber at the reference location.

This can be achieved by deﬁning a ﬁber bundle by

The ﬁber components are

CHPR∪

1,2 = M, F1,2, π1,2, M.

F1,2 = [c

( ¯Cc × ( ¯H1,2)c, P3, R3.

(72)

(73)

The Hilbert space, ( ¯H1,2)c, is the tensor product, ( ¯H1)cN( ¯H2)c of the two single particle spaces.

The main diﬀerence between this bundle and that for single particle states is that the projection, π1,2 acts

on pairs of points of M . The inverse of π1,2 deﬁnes ﬁbers associated with point pairs in M as in

1,2(x, y) = F1,2,x,y = [c
π−1

( ¯Cc

x,y × ( ¯H1,2)c

x,y), P3

x,y, R3

x,y.

(74)

At each point pair, u, v in M , the section value, λ1,2(u, v) is a vector in ( ¯H1,2)c

u,v at some level c. The
integration implied in Eq. 71 requires parallel transformation of λ1,2(u, v) at the diﬀerent point pairs to a
common reference pair, x, y. This is done by use of a connection deﬁned on a scalar scaling ﬁeld, h, deﬁned on
point pairs of M .

The action of the connection is given by

Ch(x, y; u, v)λ1,2(u, v) =

h(u, v)h(x,y)
h(x, y)h(x,y)

λ1,2(u, v)x,y.

(75)

Here h(u, v)h(x,y) and h(x, y)h(x,y) are complex numbers in the base set of ¯Ch(x,y)
h(x, y) in ¯Ch(x,y)

. Also λ1,2(u, v)x,y is the same vector in ( ¯H1,2)h(x,y)

x,y

x,y

x,y

as λ1,2(u, v) is in ( ¯H1,2)h(u,v)

u,v

.

that have values, h(u, v) and

Use of this connection enables the integrals in Eqs. 70 and 71 to be deﬁned when λ1,2 is a section. The result

is

ψh,x,y = Zx,y

h(w, z)h(x,y)
h(wx, zy)h(x,y)

λ1,2(w, z)x,ydwdz =

1

h(wx, zy)h(x,y) Zx,y

h(w, z)h(x,y)ψ1,2(w, z)|w, zidwdz.

(76)

The integral is over all points ,w, z in R3
independent of w, z. wx and zy are the points in R3

x,y. The factor h(wx, zy)h(x,y), is moved outside the integral as it is

x,y that correspond to x, y in M .

The scalar scaling function h(u, v) is deﬁned as the geometric average of g(u) and g(v) as in

where

Use of this to replace h in Eq. 76 gives

h(u, v) = pg(u)g(v) = eρ(u,v)

ρ(u, v) =

γ(u) + γ(v)

(ψ1,2)h,x,y = (ψ1,2)g,x,y = e−ρx,y(wx,zy)Zx,y

eρx,y(w,z)ψ(w, z)|w, zidwdz

(77)

(78)

(79)

as the ﬁnal result. Here ρx,y is the lifting of ρ to a scalar ﬁeld with domain R3

x,y in the ﬁber at x, y.

The action of the two particle momentum operator on ψ1,2 is

(˜p1 + ˜p2)(ψ1,2)g,x,y = e−ρx,y(wx,zy)iRx,y(∇w + ∇z)eρx,y(w,z)ψ(w, z)|w, zidwdz

= e−ρx,y(wx,zy)iRx,y eρx,y(w,z)(∇w + ∇z + 1

2 (Γ(w) + Γ(z)))ψ(w, z)|w, zidwdz.

Here Γ is the gradient of γ, lifted into the ﬁber at x, y. From this one has

(˜p1 + ˜p2)eρ(w,z) = eρ(w,z)i(∇w +

1
2

Γ(w) + ∇z +

1
2

Γ(z)).

(80)

(81)

As was the case for the single particle Hamiltonian, the eﬀect of scaling on the two particle Hamiltonian
shows up in the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy component in the two particle Hamiltonian, ˜H1,2 in the ﬁber
at x, y is

K1,2(w, z) =

(∇z +

2

Γ(z))2.

(82)

2m2

This assumes particles 1 and 2 have masses m1 and m2.

5.3 Quantum mechanics for one or two particles

So far the quantum mechanics for one particle and for two particles are based on diﬀerent ﬁber bundles. For
one particle the ﬁbers are associated with one point of M. For two particles the ﬁbers are associated with point
pairs of M . It would be good to ﬁnd a common bundle representation for both one and two particle quantum
mechanics.

One way to achieve this is to recognize that the choice of reference point pairs for the two particle case is
arbitrary. Any pair, x, y will suﬃce. This suggests that one choose x, y to be x, x. In this case the contents of
the ﬁbers Fx,x are given by

Fx,x = [c

( ¯Cc

x,x × ( ¯H1,2)c

x,x), P3

x,x, R3

x,x.

The contents of Fx,x are identical to those in the ﬁber Fx. This can be seen from

x,x × ( ¯H1,2)c
¯Cc

x,x = ¯Cc

x × ( ¯H1,2)c

x

x,x = P3
P3
x

R3

x,x = R3
x.

(83)

(84)

The description of the eﬀect of the connection and the scaling ﬁeld for the two particles is that given by

Eq.75 and following equations with y = x. Eq. 79 becomes

(ψ1,2)h,x,x = (ψ1,2)g,x,x = e−ρx,x(wx,wx)Zx,x

eρx,x(w,z)ψ(w, z)|w, zidwdz.

This equation is equivalent to

(ψ1,2)h,x = (ψ1,2)g,x = e−γx(wx)Zx

eρx(w,z)ψ(w, z)|w, zidwdz.

(85)

(86)

This is an example of the observation that quantum mechanics for two interacting particles can be included

in ﬁbers associated with single points of M . The ﬁber in the bundle, CHM∪ of Eq. 28 is expanded to

F = [c

( ¯Cc × ¯H c

1 + H c

1,2) × R3.

(87)

The ﬁber at point x is†

The scaling ﬁeld in the ﬁber is diﬀerent for the single particle space than it is for the two particle space. For the
one particle space it is given by eγx(w). for the two particle space it is given by eρx(w,z).

π−1(x) = ( ¯Cc

x × ¯H c

1,x + H c

1,2,x) × R3
x.

(88)

5.4 n interacting particles

The description for states of two entangled particles can be extended to describe the eﬀects of scaling ﬁeld on the
states and quantum mechanics of n interacting particles. The ﬁber locations are expanded from two locations
to n locations as in Fx1,··· ,xn . The Hilbert space in this ﬁber, is the n fold tensor product of the single particle
Hilbert spaces. Eq. 79 becomes

(ψ1,n)h,x1,n = (ψ1,··· ,n)g,x1,n = e−ρx1,n (wx1 ,··· ,wxn )Zx1,n
In this equation x1,n and w1,n denote x1,··· , xn and w1,··· , wn.

eρx1,n (w1,n)ψ(w1,n)|w1,nidw1,··· dwn

(89)

The only diﬀerence from the two particle entangled state description is that the scaling ﬁeld h(x, y) must be

generalized to

h(x1,··· , xn) = (×n

j=1g(xj))1/n = ePn

j=1 γ(xj)/n = eρ(x1,n).

(90)

The subscript, x1,n on ρ in the above equation indicates the lifting of ρ from a function on n tuples of points in
M to n tuples of points in R3
x1,n . The momentum and kinetic energy for the jth particle in the ﬁber, Fx1,n are
given by

and

˜pj(wj ) = i(∇wj +

Γ(wj )

n

)

Kj =

2

2mj

(∇wj +

Γ(wj )

n

)2.

(91)

(92)

Here mj is the mass of the jth particle.

5.5 Quantum mechanics for one or more particles.

Inclusion of the quantum mechanics for n interacting particles is included in the ﬁber bundle for one particle
in the same way as was done for two particles. The reference ﬁber location, x1,··· , xn, in the n particle ﬁber
bundle, is chosen to be xj = x for 1 ≥ j ≥ n. In this case ¯Cc
x. The n fold tensor
product Hilbert space,

x,··· ,x = ¯Cc

x,··· ,x = R3

n

n

¯H c

1,n,x,··· ,x = (

Oj=1

¯H c

j )x,··· ,x = (

Oj=1

¯H c

j )x

can be added to the ﬁber bundle for one and two particles with ﬁbers at single points of M .

The scaling function for this Hilbert space at x is
h(y1,n)x = (×n

j=1gx(yj))1/n = eρx(y1,n)

where

ρx(y1,n) = Pn

j=1 γx(yj)

.

n

(93)

(94)

(95)

Lifted into the ﬁber at x, this scaling function has, as domain, n tuples of points in R3
of the form eρ(w1,n)h(y1,n ) in the base set of ¯Ch(y1,n)

x. The values are numbers
. Here y1,n = y1,··· , yn. A similar equivalence holds for w1,n.
This shows that states for arbitrary but ﬁxed numbers of interacting particles can be described in ﬁber
bundles with ﬁbers associated with single points of M . Additional components of quantum mechanics, such as
momenta, energy and Hamiltonians can be included. This description is also suitable for relativistic quantum
mechanics where states have components with diﬀerent numbers of particles.

x

†If desired, a representation of the momentum space as P3

x can be added to the ﬁber at x.

6. CONCLUSION

The description of the eﬀect of number structure scaling on nonrelativistic quantum mechanics has been extended
from that in earlier work. In earlier work16 the description was limited to states, momenta, and Hamiltonians for
single particles. Here states, momenta, and Hamiltonians for two or more interacting particles were described.
This includes the eﬀects of scaling on entangled quantum states.

For single particle states the eﬀect of scaling was to multiply the state amplitude at a point y by the value
of a complex scaling ﬁeld, g at y where g(y) = eγ(y). For n particle entangled states the state amplitude at the
n-tuple, y1,··· , yn of points was multiplied by a scaling factor that was the geometric average of the scaling
factors for the individual points. That is

where

g(y1,··· , yn) = (×n

j=1g(yj)1/n = eγ(y1,··· ,yn)

γ(y1,··· , yn) = Pn

n

j=1 γ(yj)

.

(96)

(97)

The mathematical framework of ﬁber bundles was used here to describe the eﬀects of number scaling. The
ﬁbers of the bundles that include the description of n interacting particles were associated with n-tuples of space
locations. This led to the problem of how to combine bundle descriptions for diﬀerent numbers of interacting
particles into one ﬁber bundle picture.

This problem was solved by noting that n-tuples of reference locations where the n locations were all the
same was equivalent to a description with each ﬁber at a single location. The result was a single ﬁber bundle
description for quantum mechanics of an arbitrary number of particles. For n particles, the component of the
ﬁber at x consists of an n fold tensor product of single particle Hilbert spaces. The associated scaling factor is
that of Eq. 96.

Much work remains. This includes extension of the description to include relativistic quantum mechanics
and general relativity. Fiber bundles are well suited for this task.
In addition one wants to determine the
physical nature, if any, of the complex scaling ﬁeld, γ. The absence of any experimental eﬀect of the scaling ﬁeld,
indicates that its local eﬀect, must be below the sensitivity of experiments, at least so far. The eﬀect of the ﬁeld
at cosmological distances is, at present, open.
