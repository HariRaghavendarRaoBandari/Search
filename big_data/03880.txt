Abstract

New solution for two interpenetrating universes is found. Higher deriva-
tive gravity acting in 6-dimensional space is the basis of the study that
allows to obtain stable solution without introducing matter of any sort.
Stability of the solution is maintained by a diﬀerence between asymptotic
behavior at spacial inﬁnities. For an external observer such a funnel looks
similar to a spherical wormhole.

Introduction

The theory of gravity provides us with great variety of nontrivial objects. Most
known of them are black holes and wormholes. The existence of black holes
acquires substantial observational background nowadays. Wormholes are con-
sidered as a hypothetical way to pass from one large space to another: a property
which distinguishes traversable wormholes from black holes [1], [2]. Other stable
topological conﬁgurations of space (geons) are considered as particle-like objects
possessing a mass and a charge. The problem of a topology changes is discussed
in [3]. A Lorentzian wormhole is a space-time whose spatial sections contain
two asymptotically ﬂat regions joined by a ”throat”. Most of the literature
is devoted to 4-dim wormholes, however there is substantial branch concern-
ing spaces of an arbitrary dimensionality, see e.g. [4]. Lorentzian wormholes
embedded in the de Sitter space are discussed in [5], [6], [7].

In this paper, new solution with properties similar to those of a wormhole
is discussed. The result is based on the extra space idea with a dimensionality
D > 5 and the gravity with higher derivatives. Multidimensional wormholes
are also discussed in the literature see e.g. [8]. The interest in f (R) theo-
ries is motivated by inﬂationary scenarios starting from the pioneering work of
Starobinsky [9]. A number of viable f (R) models in 4-dim space that satisfy the
observable constraints are proposed in Refs. [10], [11], [12]. Also, substantially

1

new results may be obtained on the basis of f (R)-theories of gravity, see [13] [14]
and references therein.
In this paper it is supposed that our Universe is described by a (d + 1)-
dim space (d > 3) with a topology T × Vd. Its volume was comparable with
unity in the Planck units at the moment of its origination from the space time
foam. In the following three of these dimensions grew while others remained
compact and/or small.
It seems reasonable to suppose that the choice was
made accidentally depending on initial conditions, see e.g. [15]. It is commonly
accepted that our Universe belongs to only one of such 3-dim subspaces. If it
is not true new space geometry caused by nontrivial boundary conditions at
inﬁnity is formed. Its structure is studied below. For an external observer the
solution looks like a wormhole though its internal geometry is diﬀerent.

2 Equations, boundary conditions

and funnel formation

Let us consider a gravity with higher order derivatives and action in the form

f (R) = v1(R − R0)2 + v2.

operator (cid:3) = ∂B(GAB(cid:112)|G|∂B)/(cid:112)|G|.

(2)
where A, B = 1, .., D and fR ≡ df /dR. Here (cid:3) stands for the d’Alembert
In the following we assume that the
4-dim subspace is equipped with the Minkowski metric so that the cosmological
constant should be zero. It holds if the parameter v2 = 0.
Simplest solution to system (2) is the direct products M4 × VD−4 of the
Minkowski space and (D − 4)-dim extra space with metric

Gµν = diag(1,−1,−1,−1),
Gab = r0 · diag(−1,− sin2 Z4,− sin2 Z4 sin2 Z5, ...),
µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3,

where r0 = (cid:112)(D − 4)/R0 is a radius of (D − 4)-dim sphere. The latter is

a, b = 4, 5, ..., D,

(3)

considered as an extra space with coordinates Z4, ..., ZD and the Ricci scalar
RD−4 = R0. The coordinates Z0, Z1, Z2, Z3 describe the Minkowski space with
the Ricci scalar R4 = 0. The the Ricci scalar RD of the D-dim space with
metric (3)

(4)
does not depend on coordinates so that system (3) holds true if f (R) = v1(R −
R0)2.

R = RD = R4 + RD−4 = R0

2

Figure 1: Interpenetrating spaces in the spherical coordinates looks like two
intersecting funnels.

Notice that the Lagrangian parameter R0 represents our model while the pa-
rameter r0 relates to the boundary conditions. If one chooses another boundary

parameter r1 (cid:54)=(cid:112)(D − 4)/R0 the stationary metric appears to be much more

complex [16], [17].
Let us consider more interesting case with the 4-dim metric depending on a
single coordinate, say Z1. It holds if boundary conditions at Z1 → +∞ and at
Z1 → −∞ diﬀer from each other. More deﬁnitely, suppose that ﬁrst condition
at Z1 → +∞ coincides with trivial solution (3)

Gµν(Z1 → +∞) = diag(1,−1,−1,−1),
Gab(Z1 → +∞) = r0 · diag(−1,− sin2 Z4,− sin2 Z4 sin2 Z5, ...),
µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3,

a, b = 4, 5, ..., D.

The subspace described by space coordinates 1, 2, 3 is assumed to be large.

Another boundary condition at Z1 → −∞

Gµν(Z1 → −∞) = diag(1,−1,−1,−1),
Gab(Z1 → −∞) = r0 · diag(−1,− sin2 Z2,− sin2 Z2 sin2 Z3, ...),
µ, ν = 0, 1, 4, 5,

a, b = 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, ..., D.

(5)

(6)

relates to another large subspace with space coordinates 1, 4, 5.
Both boundary conditions (5) and (6) represent substantially diﬀerent sta-
tionary solutions at Z1 = ±∞. Therefore some solution connecting asymptotic

3

regions Z1 → +∞ and Z1 → −∞ should exist in analogy with well known kink
solutions [18].

One of the possible form of such a space is shown in Fig.1. This form is
conﬁrmed by a numerical simulation discussed below. If an observer moves along
the Z1−coordinate and intersects a point Z1 = 0 she/he ﬁnds out an increasing
of one large subspace and decreasing of another. Far from the transition at
Z1 = 0 both of these subspaces are described by the Minkowski geometry.

3 Funnel-like solution
Let us specify a geometry of the space and consider the space VD with D = 6
and metric in the form

ds2 = e2α(u)dt2 − du2 − e2β1(u)G1,abdyadyb − e2β2(u)G2,mndzmdzn

(7)
where −∞ < u < ∞. There are three independent functions - β1(u), β2(u) and
the redshift function α(u). The variable u is a proper distance coordinate. The
2-dim subspaces W1,2 are described by coordinates ya, a = 3, 4; zm, m = 5, 6
and represent two spheres of radius r1(u) = eβ1(u) and r2(u) = eβ2(u). The Ricci
scalar

R = R(α, β1, β2) = 2e

+ 2e−2β2 − 2α(cid:48)(cid:48)(u) − 4β(cid:48)(cid:48)

may be expressed in terms of the metric functions α(u), β1(u), β2(u). As the
next step, one can easily check that direct product of the 4-dim Minkowski space

with coordinates t, u, y1, y2 and 2-dim sphere of the radius r0 = (cid:112)2/R0 with

metric functions

α(u) = 0, β1(u) = ln|u|, β2(u) =

gives the Ricci scalar in the form (4) and therefore is the solution to system (2).
The choice of boundary conditions is the key point. Let the ﬁrst of them co-
incide with stationary solution (9) at u → +∞. The second boundary condition
(at u → −∞) is chosen in the form

α = 0, β2 = ln|u|, β1 =

u → −∞,

,

(10)

obtained by the index substitution 1 ←→ 2. In this case, the Minkowski space
is described by coordinates t, u, z1, z2. A kink-like solution should ﬁt two essen-
tially diﬀerent stationary metrics as boundary conditions at u → ±∞.

There are several ways to determine the functions α(u), β1(u), β2(u) repre-
senting the metric. Firstly, explicit form of the metric (7) and the Ricci scalar
(8) may be substituted right into the system (2) with the following complex
numerical analysis.

w = 0.036. The Lagrangian parameters v1 = 5, v2 = 0, R0 = 0.01.

The second way consists of introducing a Lagrangian multiplier λ into the
action [14]. After integration over y and z variables the action (1) acquires the
form

dtdueα+2β1+2β2 [f (R) − λ(R − R(α, β1, β2))]

where the Ricci scalar R(u) is considered as an independent function. Classical
equations obtained by variation (12) with respect to the functions α(u), β1(u), β2(u),
together with the Ricci scalar (8) form the system of four independent equations
for four functions.

In this paper, numerical solution was found by the Ritz method. To this
end one should perform minimization procedure of action (1) on a class of trial
functions. Let us choose them in the form

with free parameter w. Here the deﬁnitions r1,2(u) ≡ eβ1,2(u) and rextra ≡

(cid:112)2/R0 are used. Asymptotic behavior

α(u → ±∞; w) = 0,
r1(u → +∞; w) = u, r1(u → −∞; w) = rextra,
r2(u → −∞; w) = u, r2(u → +∞; w) = rextra

(14)

of these functions meet boundary conditions (9) and (10).

Numerical value of the adjusted parameter w is obtained by optimizing the
action (1) as the function of w. The result of numerical calculation is represented
in Fig.2. The profound minimum is attained at the point w = wm = 0.036 for
the Lagrangian parameter R0 = 0.01. Therefore we may choose trial functions
α(u, wm), r1,2(u, wm) = exp{β1,2(u, wm)} from (13) as the approximate solution
for metric (7). Their form is represented in Fig.3 and Fig.1. An observer that
is moving to the point u = 0 feels the increase in the size of extra space.
After passing through the point u = 0, roles of the 2-dimensional subspaces are
reversed. Those which were large became small and vise versa.

Note that conditions β(cid:48)

1(u = 0) = β(cid:48)

2(u = 0) = 0 crucial for wormholes are
not necessary now. Hence we can obtain stationary funnel-like solutions without
introducing phantom ﬁelds.

4 Conclusion

New solution connecting two universes is found. For an external 4-dim observer
such a funnel looks similar to a spherical wormhole though its internal structure
is diﬀerent. Wormhole represents two 4-dim space areas smoothly connected

6

to each other while the solution discussed in the paper represents two 6-dim
interpenetrating space areas each containing 4-dim Minkowski space and 2-dim
compact extra space.

Higher derivative gravity acting in 6-dimensional space is the basis of the
study that allows to obtain the solution (funnel) without introducing a matter.
Stability of the solution is maintained by the diﬀerence between asymptotic
behavior at ±∞.
The funnel is observed as a massive object with a ”throat” size smaller
than 10−18cm. They could contribute to the dark matter provided that their
abundance is suﬃcient.
