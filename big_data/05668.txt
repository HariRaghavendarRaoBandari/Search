Abstract

In the context of the minimal SO(5) linear σ-model, a complete renormalizable Lagrangian
-including gauge bosons and fermions- is considered, with the symmetry softly broken to
SO(4). The scalar sector describes both the electroweak Higgs doublet and the singlet σ.
Varying the σ mass would allow to sweep from the regime of perturbative ultraviolet com-
pletion to the non-linear one assumed in models in which the Higgs particle is a low-energy
remnant of some strong dynamics. We analyze the phenomenological implications and con-
straints from precision observables and LHC data. Furthermore, we derive the d ≤ 6 eﬀective
Lagrangian in the limit of heavy exotic fermions.

Introduction

1
The discovery of the Higgs boson has conﬁrmed the simplest possible picture of electroweak
symmetry breaking and mass generation. As predicted long ago by the Standard Model of
particle physics (SM), the Higgs mechanism splits an elementary doublet of scalar particles
into an unphysical sector, providing the longitudinal polarization to the vector bosons W
and Z, and a single physical spin zero particle. For a long time this picture has been ques-
tioned, specially in connection to the naturalness problem, also called “electroweak hierarchy
problem”, that is the stability of the electroweak scale against quantum corrections and its
smallness compared to other higher scales to which the Higgs ﬁeld may be sensitive, if such
new scales of physics do exist in nature. The tension would be manifest in the Higgs mass
being lower than those putative scales.

The challenge raised by the lightness of the Higgs mass becomes increasingly pressing as
long as no ﬁrm signal of beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics appears in new data. The
resistance to accept extreme ﬁne-tunings has been historically most fruitful, prompting the
identiﬁcation of new symmetries to justify dynamically scales smaller than the characteristic
overall scale of a given theory; a magniﬁcent example is for instance the prediction of the
charm particle [1] and its mass [2]. The observed light Higgs mass poses a similar conundrum.
Moreover the Higgs boson of the SM would represent the unique example of elementary
spin zero particle in nature, while in other known phenomena of spontaneous symmetry
breaking its role is played by composite excitations. Supersymmetry would justify elementary
scalars, actually one copy for each known fermion, but no direct or indirect hints of them has
been found so far. In fact, the only degrees of freedom found in nature prior to the Higgs
discovery which may originate from scalar ﬁelds were Goldstone bosons: the longitudinal
components of the electroweak gauge bosons. This suggested decades [3–5] ago a dynamical
nature for the Higgs particle as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB) which would
justify a light Higgs. All components of the Higgs multiplet would then share a common
Goldstone origin, providing a beautifully homogeneous picture. In the initial proposal the
Higgs originated from one of the Goldstone bosons produced in the spontaneous breaking of
a high-energy SU(5) invariant strong dynamics. Recent attempts tend to start instead from
a SO(5) symmetry [6, 7] spontaneously broken to SO(4) at some high scale Λ, producing
at this stage an ancestor of the Higgs particle in the form of one of the resulting Goldstone
bosons, with characteristic scale f and Λ ≤ 4πf [8]. The coset SO(5)/SO(4) represents the
minimal possibility to interpret the Higgs as a pseudo-Goldstone boson in the presence of a
custodial symmetry.

The fermionic couplings of the SO(5) invariant sector to the SM fermions and gauge
bosons give an additional -generally soft- breaking of SO(5) resulting in a potential for the
Goldstone Higgs. Its minimum breaks spontaneously the electroweak symmetry at a scale
v, which phenomenologically needs to diﬀer from f, and gives a mass to the Higgs particle.
Moreover, this type of theories [9] proposes naturally a seesaw-like mechanism for quarks
and leptons, whose masses would be inversely proportional to the heavy fermion mass scale.
It is most suggestive that the seesaw mechanism would not then be reduced to the realm
of neutrino masses - for which it is the best candidate theory- but it would be instead the
universal pattern behind all fermion masses.

A Goldstone-boson parenthood for the Higgs is not exclusive of those models, often called
“composite Higgs” models, but is also embedded in other constructions such as “little Higgs”
models, extra-dimensional scenarios and others.
In concrete models the spectra of exotic
fermions are directly related to the light fermion masses – in particular the top mass– and

3

the Higgs mass. The values of these masses generally require a spectrum with some exotic
fermion masses below the TeV scale, a fact often in tension with experimental searches [10,11].
It is interesting to clarify the degree of ﬁne-tuning that the models require, in view of the
electroweak hierarchy problem.

Most of the literature on composite Higgs models based on SO(5) assumes from the start
a strong dynamics and uses an eﬀective non-linear formulation of the model(s) [7, 12–18].
This approach has the advantage of being completely general, oﬀering a parametrization of
all possible ultraviolet completions for the symmetry group chosen. At the same time one
of its limitations is that it is applicable only in a ﬁnite domain of energies. Here instead
we construct a complete renormalizable model which in its scalar part is a linear sigma
model including a new scalar particle σ, singlet under the gauge group. This will allow to
gain intuition on the dependence on the ultraviolet (UV) completion scale of the model, by
varying the σ mass: a light σ particle corresponds to a weakly coupled regime, while in the
high mass limit the theory should fall back onto an usual eﬀective non-linear construction.
Our complete renormalizable model can thus be considered either as an ultimate model made
out of elementary ﬁelds, or as a renormalizable version of a deeper dynamics, much as the
linear σ model [19] is to QCD. One former attempt in this direction [20] did not fully take
into account and computed the impact of the fermionic sector on the main phenomenological
observables, see also Ref. [21].

While the choice of the minimal bosonic sector is clear, there is a number of possible
choices for the fermionic sector. The option explored in this paper assumes heavy fermions
in vectorial representations of SO(5), in contrast to models where the SM left doublets are
embedded in SO(5) multiplets [20]. Direct couplings between SM fermions and the heavy
fermions will be the source of the soft SO(5) breaking, while the Higgs particle has tree-level
couplings only with the exotic fermionic sector, via SO(5)-invariant Yukawa couplings. It
will be discussed how the induced Coleman-Weinberg potential requires soft breaking terms
to be included in the scalar potential.

The usual SM Higgs sector is now substituted by a Higgs-σ sector, correcting the strength
of the SM Higgs-gauge boson couplings and opening new interaction channels. The phe-
nomenology of the σ production and decay will be also studied, including fermionic and
bosonic tree-level and one loop decays (e.g. gluon-gluon and photon-photon). Analysis of
present Higgs data will be used to set a constraint on the ﬁne-tuning ratio v/f. The con-
tribution of the Higgs, σ and the exotic fermions to the oblique S and T parameters will
be computed. One aim of the phenomenological study is to clarify the impact of the size
of the ultraviolet scale - here represented by the σ mass - on the tensions of this type of
theories. Particular emphasis will be dedicated to the impact of the σ particle on present
and future LHC data, produced either via gluon fusion or vector-boson fusion and decaying
into a plethora of channels including diphoton ﬁnal state.

Furthermore, as this paper focuses on the impact of a dynamical σ particle, we identify
below some of the leading low-energy bosonic operators stemming from the new physics
when the exotic heavy fermion sector is integrated out: we determine the dominant eﬀective
operators made out of the σ ﬁeld and/or SM ﬁelds, as a ﬁrst step towards the identiﬁcation
of a “benchmark” electroweak eﬀective Lagrangian including a light dynamical Higgs. A
non-linear eﬀective Lagrangian should result in the limit of very heavy σ. An interesting
characteristic of the non-linear scenario is that the low-energy physical Higgs ﬁeld turns out
not to be an exact electroweak doublet, and may appear in the eﬀective Lagrangian as a
generic SM scalar singlet with arbitrary couplings. The most general eﬀective Lagrangian of

4

this type [22,23] turns out to depend on a plethora of couplings, though. It would be useful
to identify the reduced pattern of dominant couplings characteristic of models in which the
Higgs is a pseudo-Goldstone boson in that regime [24].

The structure of the paper can be easily inferred from the Table of Contents.

2 The SO(5)/SO(4) scalar sector
The complete Lagrangian can be written as the sum of three terms describing respectively
the pure gauge, scalar and fermionic sectors,

L = Lgauge + Lscalar + Lfermion,

(1)
where Lgauge reduces to the SM gauge kinetic terms. This section discusses in detail the
scalar sector and its interactions, while the study of the fermionic sector is deferred to the
next section.

In order to deﬁne the linear σ model corresponding to an SO(5) symmetry spontaneously
broken to SO(4), let us consider a real scalar ﬁeld φ in the fundamental representation of
SO(5). Three among its ﬁve components will be ultimately associated with the longitudinal
components of the SM gauge bosons - denoted below by πi, i = 1, 2, 3, while the other two will
correspond to the Higgs particle h and to an additional scalar σ, respectively. For simplicity
the results will be often presented in the unitary gauge (u.g.), in which πi = 0:

φ = (π1, π2, π3, h, σ)T

u.g.→ (0, 0, 0, h, σ)T .

(2)

The scalar Lagrangian describing the scalar-gauge and the scalar-scalar interactions reads

2(Dµφ)T (Dµφ) − V (φ) ,

L and Σi

and Σi
R denote respectively the generators of the SU(2)L and SU(2)R subgroups of
the custodial SO(4) group contained in SO(5). The embedding of the gauge group SU(2)L×
U(1)Y inside SO(5), implicitly assumed in Eqs. (2-4), is purely conventional. As we will
see in section 2.1, both h and σ acquire a vacuum expectation value (vev), leaving unbroken
an SO(4)0 subgroup which is rotated with respect to the group SO(4) ≈ SU(2)L × SU(2)R
containing SU(2)L × U(1)Y .
For later convenience it is pertinent to introduce the complex notation for the scalar ﬁeld
φ. Denoting by H ( ˜H) the SM Higgs doublet transforming as (2, 1/2) ((2,−1/2)) under the
SU(2)L × U(1)Y gauge group, a complex scalar ﬁeld in the fundamental representation of
SO(5) can be deﬁned as

H T , ˜H T , σ

2.1 The scalar potential
The most general SO(4) preserving while SO(5) breaking renormalizable potential depends
a priori on ten parameters. Two of them can be reabsorbed via a redeﬁnition of parame-
ters 1, resulting on a Lagrangian dependent on one SO(5) preserving coupling, λ, one scale f
heralding spontaneous SO(5)/SO(4) breaking, and six SO(5) soft-breaking terms (denoted
below α, β, a1,2,3,4). The Lagrangian in the unitary gauge reads:

σ2 + h2 − f 2(cid:17)2 + αf 3 σ − f 2β h2 + a1 f σh2 + a2 σ2h2 + a3 f σ3 + a4 h4 . (8)

V (h, σ) = λ

(cid:16)

In order to retrieve the formulae in a general gauge it suﬃces to replace h2 by the SO(4)
invariant combination h2 + ~π2.

The only strictly necessary soft breaking terms are α and β as they need to be present
to absorb divergences generated by one-loop Coleman-Weinberg contributions to the La-
grangian, as shown in Appendix A; only those terms will be considered in what follows 2, a
procedure already previously adopted in Ref. [20]. The potential then reads

(cid:16)
h2 + σ2 − f 2(cid:17)2 + αf 3 σ − βf 2 h2 ,

V (h, σ) = λ

(9)

resulting on a system depending on four parameters. The scalar quartic coupling λ can
σ ’ 8λf 2 for negligible α and β; the
be conventionally traded by the σ mass, given by m2
non-linear model would be recovered in the limit mσ (cid:29) f, that is λ (cid:29) 1.
A consistent electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking requires both scalars h, σ to acquire
a non-vanishing vev, respectively dubbed as v and vσ below, as for v 6= 0 the SO(4) global
group and the EW group are spontaneously broken. Note that the vev of h is identiﬁed with
the electroweak scale since it can be related to the Fermi constant precisely as in the SM, see
Sect. 2.2 below. For α, β 6= 0 and assuming v 6= 0, it results

satisfying the condition

(11)
which indicates that the SO(5) vev is “renormalized” by the β term in the potential. From
Eqs. (10) and (11) it follows that both f 2 > 0 and f 2 < 0 are in principle allowed 3, in
appropriate regions of the parameters (α, β, λ). However, in the SO(5)-invariant limit, for

σ = f 2 (1 + β/2λ) ,

v2 + v2

1Here we choose to get rid of the σ2 and σ4 terms.
2Full renormalizability of the theory requires, in general, the presence of all gauge invariant operators of dimension
equal to or smaller than four. At two or more loops, the renormalization procedure may thus require to include
further symmetry breaking terms beyond those considered; we will assume that their ﬁnite contributions will be
weighted by comparatively negligible coeﬃcients and can be safely omitted in our analysys.

3For f 2 < 0, α would have to be purely imaginary because of hermiticity.

6

negative f 2 the minimum of the potential is at the origin and in consequence the symmetry
is unbroken and there are no Goldstone bosons. The focus of this paper is instead set
on the interpretation of the Higgs particle as a PNGB, which requires f 2 > 0 as well as
|v| < |vσ|, the latter condition deﬁning the region in parameter space continuously connected
with the limiting case v = 0 in which the Higgs particle becomes a true Goldstone boson.
For f 2 > 0, the positivity of v2 in Eq. (10) and the |v| < |vσ| constraint lead respectively to
the conditions 4

(13)
which for |β| (cid:28) λ would indicate 2β2 (cid:46) α2 (cid:46) 4β2. Moreover, in order to get v2 (cid:28) f 2,
Eq. (10) requires a ﬁne-tuning such that α/2β is very close to unity.
Expanding the σ and h ﬁelds around their minima, h ≡ ˆh + v and σ ≡ ˆσ + vσ, and

diagonalizing the scalar mass matrix, the mass eigenstates are given by

hphys = ˆh cos γ − ˆσ sin γ

,

σphys = ˆσ cos γ + ˆh sin γ .

(14)

For simplicity, from now on the notation hphys and σphys will be traded by h and σ, respec-
tively. The mixing angle in Eq. (14) is given by

(17)

with the second constraint coinciding with that in Eq. (12) multiplying it by 1/(4βλ); it
follows that β > 0. If the soft mass term proportional to β in the scalar potential Eq. (9)
would be overall positive (as for instance for f 2<0 and β > 0), the minimum would always
correspond to an undesired symmetric EW vacuum v = 0. Assuming the SO(5) explicit

The physical scalars thus correspond to a “light” state with mass O(

βv) and a “heavy”
√
state with mass O(
λf). It will be later shown that, for a PNGB Higgs particle (that is
v < vσ and f 2 > 0), the less ﬁne-tuned regions in parameter space correspond to the case
mlight = mh and mheavy = mσ in the equations above. In fact, would the σ particle be lighter
than the Higgs, the roles of the lighter and heavier eigenstates would be ﬂipped and the
mixing angle γ will be necessarily outside the region quoted above. The lighter σ scenario is
quite diﬀerent from the typical Higgs PNGB scenarios considered in the literature.

Notice that for mh < mσ and at variance with the SM case, in the regime of small soft
SO(5) breaking the mass of the Higgs and its quartic self-coupling are controlled by two
diﬀerent parameters, β and λ, respectively. This is consistent with the PNGB nature of the
Higgs boson whose mass should now appear protected from growing in the strong interacting
regime of the theory –corresponding to large λ– in which instead the σ mass would increase.
In other words, we have replaced the hierarchy problem for the Higgs particle mass by a
sensitivity of the σ particle to heavier scales: the σ mass represents generically the heavy UV
completion. The expression for mh shows that the value of the β parameter for small β/4λ
is expected to be β ∼ m2

h/2v2 ∼ 0.13.

2.2 Scalar-gauge boson couplings

(cid:17)2
reads

and justiﬁes the previous identiﬁcation of the Higgs vev v with the electroweak scale deﬁned
from the W mass

v = 246 GeV .

(19)
The rotation to the physical h, σ ﬁelds results in the following Lagrangian for the scalar and
scalar-gauge interactions, for mh < mσ,

The physical Higgs couplings are thus seen to be weighted down by a cos γ factor with respect
to the SM Higgs ones, while the σ ﬁeld acquires the same interactions than h albeit weighted
down by sin γ, a fact rich in phenomenological consequences to be discussed further below.
The SM limit is recovered when the σ ﬁeld is decoupled from the spectrum and cos γ = 1
follows from Eqs. (10) and (15). Conversely, for mh > mσ the mixing dependence would
correspond to the interchange cos γ ↔ sin γ in Eq. (20).

2.3 Renormalization and scalar tree-level decays
The four independent parameters of the scalar Lagrangian can be expressed in terms of four
observables, which we choose to be:

√
GF ≡ (

2v2)−1,

mh,

mσ,

sin γ ,

(21)

8

with the Fermi constant GF as measured from muon decay and mh from the Higgs pole mass,
while mσ could be determined from future measurements of the σ mass, and sin γ from either
deviations of the Higgs couplings or from the σ line shape obtained from its decay into four
leptons for mσ ≥ 300 GeV, analogous to the case of a heavy SM Higgs boson 6.

Using Eqs. (10), (15), (16) and (19), the exact expressions for the h and σ vevs in terms

of those physical parameters can be obtained

A few comments regarding the parameter space and the scalar spectrum are in order,
as arbitrary values of mσ and sin2 γ are not allowed if we insist on interpreting the Higgs
boson as the pseudogoldstone boson of a spontaneous SO(5) breaking. Fig. 1 displays the
(mσ, sin2 γ) plane: at each point the scalar sector is completely deﬁned as mh and v are ﬁxed
to their physical values. The diﬀerently colored regions correspond to

• No SO(5) breaking in the light red region, where f 2 < 0; its red borders depict the

• The σ particle being the PNGB of the spontaneous breaking of SO(5) in the light brown

f 2 = 0 frontier;

region, where vσ < v;

6For a lighter σ, the decay width becomes too narrow –possibly even below the experimental resolution– and
more ingenious procedures would be required to determine the scalar mixing strength, such as for instance on-shell
to oﬀ-shell cross section measurements [25].

Figure 1: mσ versus sin2 γ parameter space of the scalar sector. The Higgs mass mh and the
Higgs vev v have been ﬁxed to their physical values. The red region corresponds to f 2 < 0,
for which the SO(5)-invariant part of the potential is unbroken and there are no Goldstone
bosons in the symmetric limit. The region where |v| > |vσ| is shown in brown (these regions
are excluded by Higgs data, see text). The Higgs is a pseudo-Goldstone boson within the
white regions at the bottom-right and the top-left part of the plane.

• The Higgs as the PNGB of the SO(5) → SO(4) breaking in the white areas, where
v < vσ and the Higgs would became a true goldstone boson in the absence of EW
breaking (v → 0).

A complementary divide is provided by the value of the Higgs mass:

• On the mh < mσ region to the right of the ﬁgure, the physical Higgs couplings to
SM particles are weighted down by cos γ with respect to SM values, see for instance
Eq. (20). It will be shown in the next sections that present LHC Higgs data only allow
for values sin2 γ < 0.18 at 2σ CL, though, leaving as allowed parameter space a fraction
of the lower white (Higgs PNGB) section of the ﬁgure. The analysis in the next sections
will thus focus in this regime, for which Fig. 1 already suggests a lower bound on mσ
of a few hundreds of GeV. The relative importance of the soft breaking terms is also
illustrated through the curves depicted for ﬁxed α/β and β/λ;

• On the mσ < mh area to the right of the ﬁgure, the physical Higgs couplings to SM
particles are instead weighted down by sin γ, whose value will thus be bounded by
sin2 γ > 0.82 at 2σ CL. It thus remains as available zone the upper part of the upper
white (Higgs PNGB) region. Nevertheless, the quartic coupling λ is there very small,
typically λ < 10−3, making the SO(5) invariant potential very ﬂat and potentially
unstable against radiative corrections; furthermore, if the soft breaking parameters are

extra ﬁne-tuning with respect to radiative corrections from the fermionic sector to be
discussed further below. For these reasons we will not dwell further below on the case
mσ < mh even if phenomenologically of some interest.

Extending the renormalization scheme to the gauge sector, we choose the two extra ob-

servables needed to be the mass of the Z boson and the ﬁne structure constant,

with MZ and αem as determined from Z-pole mass measurements and from Thompson scat-

and thus the measurement of the line shape of the σ seems feasible only for mσ above the
EW breaking scale (assuming non-negligible mixing). In that regime, the value of sin γ can
be inferred from the line shape and all other observables in Eq. (28) can then be predicted in
terms of the physical parameters deﬁning our renormalization scheme. Other bosonic decay
channels requiring one-loop amplitudes will be discussed later on.

3 Fermionic sector
The fermionic sector is unavoidably an important source of model dependency as diverse
choices of SO(5) fermionic multiplets are possible. Moreover the achievement of the desired

11

Figure 2: Schematics of the SO(5) → SO(4) model

symmetry breaking pattern in “composite Higgs” models relies on the fermionic sector. A
schematic picture is given in Fig. (2) considering a high energy global symmetry group -
SO(5) in the case under discussion:

• Heavy scalar and fermion representations of the high-energy global symmetry are con-
sidered. SO(5) breaks spontaneously to SO(4) at a scale f, resulting in four massless
Goldstone bosons: the three longitudinal components of the electroweak gauge bosons
and a “Higgs Goldstone boson”. The ﬁfth component σ remains massive.

• Furthermore, SO(5) is explicitly broken by the coupling of the exotic heavy representa-
tions to the SM fermions (soft breaking) and to the gauge bosons (hard breaking). This
induces at one-loop a potential for the h ﬁeld with a non-trivial minimum, providing a
mass for h and breaking the SM electroweak symmetry at a scale v 6= f.

Several “minimal” possibilities have been explored in the literature for the exotic fermionic
representations (see for instance Refs. [13,20]). The setup considered in this paper contains:
1. Heavy (exotic) vector-like fermions in complete representations of SO(5), either in the

fundamental representation, denoted below by ψ - or singlets denoted by χ.

2. A scalar ﬁeld φ in the fundamental representation of SO(5), which contains the h and
σ particles. Its vev breaks SO(5) spontaneously to SO(4)0. By construction only the
heavy exotic fermions couple directly to the scalar φ.

3. The Higgs ﬁeld couples to the exotic fermions only via SO(5) invariant Yukawa cou-
plings. The sources of SO(5) breaking lie instead in the electroweak gauge interactions
and in mixing terms between the heavy exotic fermions and the SM fermions. Such a
breaking is fed via loop corrections to the scalar potential, where it is modeled by two
SO(5) soft breaking terms which are custodial preserving.

This choice of fermionic representation respects an approximate custodial symmetry which
protects the Zbb coupling [28]. Fig. (3) illustrates an intriguing characteristic of the fermionic
sector in this class of models –which are often denominated by the generic name of “partial

12

compositeness” [9]: a seesaw-like mechanism is at work in the generation of all low-energy
fermion masses. The heavier the exotic fermions the lighter the light fermions.

To ensure correct hypercharge assignments for the SM fermions coupled directly to heavy
exotic ﬁelds, the global symmetry is customarily enlarged by (at least) an extra U(1)X sector,
leading ﬁnally to a pattern of spontaneous global symmetry breaking given by
SO(5) × U(1)X → SO(4) × U(1)X ≈ SU(2)L × SU(2)R × U(1)X ,

(30)

with the hypercharge corresponding now to a combination of the new generator and that of
SU(2)R generator, see Eq. (4),

Y = Σ(3)

R + X .

(31)

As the global U(1)X symmetry remains unbroken, no additional Goldstone bosons are gen-
erated. Two diﬀerent U(1)X charges are compatible with SM hypercharge assignments: 2/3
and −1/3. We will indeed consider two diﬀerent copies of heavy fermions for each representa-
tion, diﬀerentiated by the U(1)X, as they are necessary to induce mass terms for both the SM
up and the down quark sectors. Schematically, the fundamental and singlet representations
can be decomposed under SU(2)L quantum numbers as follows,

ψ(2/3) ∼ (X, Q, T (5))
χ(2/3) ∼ T (1)

,

,

ψ(−1/3) ∼ (Q0, X0, B(5)) ,
χ(−1/3) ∼ B(1) ,

where X(0), Q(0) denote the two diﬀerent SU(2)L doublets contained in the fundamental rep-
resentation of SO(5). In each multiplet, the ﬁrst doublet has Σ(3)
R = 1/2 while the second
R = −1/2. T(1,5), B(1,5) denote instead SU(2)L × SU(2)R singlets, respectively in
one has Σ(3)
the 5 and 1 representation of SO(5). Table 1 summarizes the relevant quantum numbers for
all heavy fermions.

The fermionic Lagrangian
For the SM fermions, the analysis below will be restricted to the third generation of SM quarks
for simplicity, denoting by qL and tR and bR the doublet and singlets, respectively. It would
be straightforward to extend the results to the other two generations, for instance introducing
heavier replica of the exotic sector, leading to very minor additional phenomenological impact.

The ﬁrst lines contain the kinetic terms for the SM fermions. The second and third lines
include the kinetic and mass terms for the exotic fermions. The kinetic terms become SO(5)-
invariant in the gaugeless limit. The fourth line contains the SO(5) invariant Yukawa cou-
plings of the exotic sector to the Higgs ﬁeld. Finally, the last two lines of the Lagrangian
contain the SO(5) soft-breaking interactions of SM fermions with exotic fermions. ∆2×5 and
∆5×1 denote suitable spurions connecting SO(5) and SU(2) × U(1) representations. If the
primed parameters were set to zero no bottom mass would be generated through this mech-
anism. All parameters in Eq. (32) are assumed real for simplicity, that is, we will assume CP
invariance in what follows.

It is useful to rewrite the Lagrangian in Eq.(32) in terms of SU(2)L components. For this
purpose, from this point and until Eq. (41) below, h and σ will denote again the unshifted

The physical light eigenstates are admixtures of the light and heavy fermion ﬁelds ap-
pearing in the Lagrangian. The scalar ﬁelds vevs induce in addition heavy fermion mass
splittings. Notice however that, even in the limit of vanishing Yukava couplings, the exotic
fermions get mixed via the SO(5) breaking couplings. Moreover, although the various di-
mensional couplings Λi and Λ0
i in Eqs. (32) and (33) may be of the same order, the top and
bottom components of the heavy doublets are splitted by SO(4) breaking terms, generically
of O(yiv).

4 Phenomenology
In this section, bounds are derived ﬁrst on the model parameters resulting from present LHC
Higgs data and from electroweak precision tests - namely S,T and gb
L. Future signals are
discussed next, focusing in particular on σ physics.

4.1 Bounds from Higgs measurements
The tree-level mixing of the scalar singlet σ with the Higgs resonance h can be strongly
bounded from present data and in particular from h to ZZ and W +W − decays, and from
h-gluon-gluon transitions: the Higgs coupling strength to SM ﬁelds is weighted down simply
by a cos γ factor with respect the SM value, as previously explained and shown in Eq. (20).
We use the latest ATLAS and CMS combined results for the gluon-gluon and vector boson
mediated Higgs production processes [29].

A χ2 ﬁt taking into account the correlation between the corresponding coupling modiﬁers
in the combined ﬁt of the 7 and 8 TeV LHC data -given by ﬁgure 23.B of Ref. [29]- constrains
directly cos γ, translating into the following bound

(43)
which in the mσ (cid:29) mh limit would point to a value for the non-linearity parameter of compos-
ite Higgs models, ξ ≡ v2/f 2 ∼ sin2 γ, consistent with the limits found in the literature [30],
see Eqs. (23) and (24) and the discussion below.

sin2 γ (cid:46) 0.18 (at 2σ) ,

Comparison with literature on non-linear realizations
Ref. [30] shows that in non-linear realizations of the composite Higgs scenario the behaviour
of the Higgs couplings modiﬁcations varies depending on the SO(5) fermionic representations
chosen. In particular they compare the so called M CHM4 and M CHM5 scenarios:

• In M CHM4, the fermions (both the embedded light ones and the heavy partners) are
(4)
in the 4 (spinorial) representation of SO(5); the coupling modiﬁers then obey k
V =
F = (1− ξ)1/2, leading to a bound from Higgs data ξ(4) < 0.18 at 2σ CL. M CHM4 is
(4)
k
actually ruled out by its impact on the Zbb coupling and thus for instance disregarded
in Ref. [13].

• In M CHM5, the fermions are instead in the 5 (fundamental) of SO(5), and in this case
V ≈ 1 − ξ for
(5)

V = (1 − ξ)1/2 diﬀers from k
(5)
(5)
k
F /k
small ξ values. LHC Higgs data set then a bound ξ(5) < 0.12 at 2σ CL.

F = (1 − 2ξ)(1 − ξ)−1/2, that is, k
(5)

Now, the heavy fermion conﬁguration of our model seems alike to that in M CHM5 if the
σ particle was disregarded (σ does not intervene in the tree-level Higgs data analysis of SM
couplings), and in spite of including one heavy fermion in a 1 (singlet) of SO(5) as the latter
could be integrated out to mimic the M CHM5 spectrum discussed for instance in Refs.
[31]
or [13].
Indeed, according to the notation in Ref. [13], the fermion representation in our
model would be given by M CHMQ−T−B → M CHM5−5,1−5,1; nevertheless, the behaviour
for the modiﬁers –and thus the resulting ξ bound– is the same than in M CHM4, see Eq. (43).
Plausibly, this apparent paradox may be resolved by taking into account that the limit of
very heavy σ corresponds to the λ coupling reaching the non-perturbative regime, and a
resumation of the strong interacting eﬀects may be needed to fully reach the non-linear
regime.

4.2 Precision electroweak constraints
Analyses available on precision tests for composite Higgs models, such as that in Ref. [32],
tend to consider non-linear versions of the theory where the only scalar present is the Higgs
particle, but for Ref. [20], which discusses qualitatively the interplay of scalar and exotic
fermion contributions. See also Ref. [21]. We present here an explicit computation of the
scalar (h and σ) and exotic fermion contributions, discussing the impact of varying the σ
mass. S, T and U parameters are considered together with gb
L and parameter correlations.

Figure 4: Uncombined contributions of the scalar sector (black curve) and the exotic
fermionic sector to the parameters S and T.

The black curve in Fig. 4 displays examples of the ∆S and ∆T corrections induced by
the σ scalar as it follows from the formulae shown above. As earlier explained, the set of
parameters in the scalar potential (f , λ , α , β) has been traded by four observables: GF , mh,
mσ and the scalar mixing γ (with the latter two yet to be experimentally measured).
It
is nevertheless theoretically illuminating to indicate the corresponding values for f and the
scalar quartic self-coupling λ for each example analyzed, and their values are shown in all
ﬁgures to follow. We present numerical results for two typical parameter regimes:

• mσ = 2 TeV, s2

γ = 0.04, which corresponds to f = 1 TeV and to scalar potential
couplings λ = 0.38, α = 0.35 and β = 0.16, which clearly lie within the perturbative
regime of the linear SO(5) sigma model.

• mσ = 6 TeV, s2

γ = 0.06, which also correspond to f = 1 TeV, while λ = 4.3 -closer to
the limit of validity of the perturbative expansion- and α = 0.25, β = 0.13; this pat-
tern corresponds then to a mainly SO(5) symmetric scenario with small soft symmetry
breaking.

Fig. 4 shows a sizeable negative contribution of the σ particle to ∆T which increases with
mσ, and positive contribution to ∆S; the result is consistent with the pattern expected in
Ref. [20], and similar to that for the heavy Higgs case (see e.g. Ref. [38]).
In the limit
mσ → mh the total scalar contribution matches that in the SM due to the Higgs particle. It
is easy to extrapolate the S and T scalar contributions to other mixing regimes as they scale
γ: for instance the eﬀect would be ampliﬁed by a factor of ∼ 3 when raising the mixing
with s2
towards the maximal value allowed, see Eq (43).
L instead we will not analyze the one-loop σ contributions, as they would be pro-
portional to the bottom Yukawa couplings and thus negligible compared to the top and
top-partner contributions to be discussed next.

Fermionic contributions
The heavy fermion sector may have an impact on the oblique parameters and on gb
L. This
sector adds additional parameter dependence on top of the four renormalization parameters
already discussed for the scalar sector of the linear SO(5) sigma model. The fermionic
parameter space is quite large and adjustable, and thus in practice mσ and γ will be treated

leptons from the ﬁrst two generations does not alter signiﬁcantly the analysis of electroweak

In the numerical analysis, the two sets of values considered earlier on for the numerical

a σ particle much heavier than the Higgs, values of f below 700 GeV would be diﬃcult to
accommodate experimentally as sin γ2 ’ v2/f 2, see Eq. (43). The exotic fermionic masses

S versus T. The fermion sector can lead to large deviations in the value of the T pa-
rameter. In Fig. (4) and in the ﬁrst panel of Fig. (5) only the fermionic contributions are
depicted. The last two panels in Fig (5) show the fermion plus scalar combined results: the
lighter the σ particle, the less tension follows with respect to electroweak precision data,
in particular due to the impact on ∆T, although it is to be noted that even for large mσ
fermionic contributions can bring (S, T) within the experimentally allowed region.

The sign of the fermionic contributions to S and T can be largely understood in terms
of the light-heavy fermion mixings and the mass hierarchy between the heavy eigenstates.
For instance, large mixing values with a heavy singlet are known to induce large positive
contributions to ∆T, as pointed out in Ref. [31], as a result from the custodial symmetry
being broken by the singlet-doublet mixing.
It is possible to illustrate the analysis more
in detail following Ref. [40], which uses a diﬀerent fermionic but nonetheless illuminating
embedding. They consider heavy vector fermions which couple directly to both the light
doublet q and the light singlet qR. When only a heavy singlet is present, the expected
contributions to ∆T and ∆S are both signiﬁcant (though the ﬁrst are more important) and
positive for the regime we consider, see their Eq. (32). Instead, when only a heavy vector
doublet was taken into account, the sign of the correction to the oblique parameters was
proportional to the sign of the mass splitting between the heavy eigenstates with charge 2/3
and −1/3, resulting in sizeable contributions to ∆T and very small to ∆S.

It is not possible to apply those conclusions in Ref. [40] directly here, though, as in

our setup the light fermion mass generation involves necessarily and simultaneously both a
heavy doublet and a heavy singlet, see Eq. (35): the light doublet q mixes directly only with
the heavy doublet Q, while qR mixes with T1. Nevertheless, the mainly positive fermionic
corrections to ∆S found are consistent with being dominated by the participation of a heavy
singlet. The results, in Fig. 7 show indeed that a large mixing between tL and the singlet
T (1) leads to a positive ∆T (left panel) while the negative corrections to ∆T obtained are
consistent instead with a large mixing between tR and the doublet component X d (middle
panel).

T versus gb

L. The deviations induced in the Zbb coupling provide additional bounds:
even if the model parameters do not impact on ∆gL
b at tree level, the top partners may
induce at loop level deviations from the SM value. Fig. 6 depicts the purely fermionic and
the scalar plus fermion combined contributions in the T − gb
L parameter space. Finally, the
right panel of Fig. 7 shows a sizeable and positive impact on gb
L of the mixing between tL
and the charge 2/3 heavy singlets T (1) and T (5).
As a ﬁnal remark, there are considerable mixings in the fermion sector for which the
dominant eﬀects go schematically as tan θij ∼ Λi/Mj. It could be thus suspected that large
deviations in the W tb coupling should occur. However, these rotations are mainly driven by
the SO(5) breaking couplings Λi and Λ0
i, which are custodial symmetry preserving. Therefore,
a large rotation in the top sector is mostly compensated by a corresponding one in the bottom
sector, leading to practically no deviation in Vtb.

With analogous procedure, the σgg amplitude can be obtained using Eq. (77) for q2 = m2

transitions.

4.4 Higgs and σ decay into γγ
There are no direct hγγ or σγγ couplings in our Lagrangian. They arise instead as eﬀective
interactions from loops of fermions and, in the case of hγγ, also of massive vector bosons. As
in the case of h and σ production via gg fusion, we distinguish between mass eigenstates h, σ
and the unrotated (interaction ) eigenstates ˆh, ˆσ.

Let the scalar-photon-photon amplitudes hγγ and σγγ be deﬁned as

5 The σ resonance at the LHC
May a light σ resonance be lurking in LHC data? In that case, what distinguishes the
phenomenology expected for an approximate SO(5) invariant scenario and that for a generic
singlet scalar freely added to the SM Lagrangian? What is the parameter space allowed
at present and the discovery reach of the next LHC run? In this section we address these
questions.

The constraints from electroweak precision tests explored in Sect. 4.2 showed that a sce-
nario with a light σ particle tends to diminish the tension with data. On the other side,
from the theoretical viewpoint the assumption of a PNGB nature for the Higgs boson within
an approximate global SO(5) symmetry mildly broken by soft terms prefers a sizeable mass
for the σ particle, see Fig. (1). The PNGB interpretation implies the existence of a non-
zero mixing between σ and h, specially when considering naturalness as a guideline since

30

sin2 γ ∼ ξ (cid:28) 1 would require a strong ﬁne-tuning of the theory -see the discussion after
Eq. (13) and Eqs. (23), (24) and (43).

As argued in Sect. 2.3, the scalar potential is completely determined by the masses mh
and mσ, the constant GF , and the scalar mixing sin γ. The conclusions obtained for the
linear σ model together with generic soft breaking terms are of general validity. The extra
ingredients needed to determine the phenomenology of the σ particle are its couplings to the
vector-like fermions of the theory, which introduce instead signiﬁcant model-dependence and
may have important consequences particularly in the production of this scalar.

In order to estimate the LHC constraints on the model, we recast many LHC searches
for scalar resonances into the σ parameter space, calculating the production cross section
and decays of the σ particle. The production of the σ particle at the LHC may proceed
mainly via two processes, gluon fusion and vector boson fusion (VBF). Gluon fusion usually
dominates the production due to the large gluon pdfs. Nevertheless, this conclusion is some-
what model-dependent as the heavy fermion couplings to σ may a priori enhance or diminish
the cross section. VBF depends essentially on the mixing angle γ, but it typically yields a
lower production cross section than gluon fusion for mσ < O(1 TeV), for which it will have
unnoticeable impact in what follows.
Consider then the cross section for σ production via gluon fusion σ(gg → σ). To account
for higher order corrections to Γ(σ → gg), we will proﬁt from the results in the literature for
a heavy SM-like Higgs boson H0, using the following approximation
|ASM(H0 → gg)|2 σSM(gg → H0) ,

σ(gg → σ) ’ |A(σ → gg)|2

(100)

where A(σ, H0 → gg) refers to leading order (one loop) amplitudes and σSM(gg → H0) is
the NNLO standard gluon fusion production cross section given in Ref. [41]. For illustrative
purposes we discuss next the LHC impact of the σ particle in two steps: ﬁrst an “only scalars”
analysis will be considered, to add next to it the eﬀect of the rather model-dependent fermionic
sector.

In the only scalars scenario, that is, a case in which the impact of the heavy fermions on
gluon fusion is negligible compared to the top contribution, the production amplitude can be
approximated by the top loop contribution for a heavy SM Higgs weighted down by sin γ.
Under this assumption, we have recasted the LHC searches for a heavy Higgs-like particle
into constraints in the {mσ, sin2 γ} plane, and the results are shown on the left panel of
Fig. 8. The searches taken into account here include diphoton [42, 43], diboson [44–47] and
dihiggs [48,49] decays. The ﬁgure shows that present LHC data are sensitive to sin2 γ ’ 0.1 for
mσ < 600 GeV, otherwise Higgs measurements put a bound on sin2 γ < 0.18 independently
of mσ. It is worth noting that these bounds apply well beyond the model discussed in this
paper: they are valid for any physics scenario in which the role of the Higgs particle is
substituted by a Higgs-scalar system with a generic mixing angle γ, independently of the
details of the theory. In addition, by combining the LHC data with theoretically motivated
constraints as those mentioned above, interesting bounds can be derived: a PNGB nature for
the Higgs boson corresponds to the area to the right of the red curve depicted, see also Fig. 1,
corresponding to the minimal theoretical requirement f 2 > 0 for SO(5) to be spontaneously
broken, resulting in the bound mσ > 500 GeV in particular from the impact of ATLAS
Hheavy → ZZ searches. If f 2 values above the electroweak scale are instead required (black
curve) mσ > 550 GeV follows. The future prospects for this “only scalars” scenario are
depicted on the right panel of Fig. 8. It shows the future LHC sensitivity in the ZZ decay

Figure 8: Present LHC (left panel) and future LHC run-2 (right panel) constraints on sin2 γ

channel of the 14 TeV LHC run with an integrated luminosity of 3 ab−1, for both ATLAS
and CMS [50], as well as the mixing disfavoured by Higgs data assuming a 5% precision on
the Higgs couplings to SM particles. In the absence of any beyond the SM signal, future LHC
data together with the aforementioned theory constraints could push the limit on the σ mass
above 900 GeV–1.4 TeV.

The diﬀerence between the LHC predictions of the model discussed in this paper and
those stemming from extending the SM by a generic scalar singlet (see e.g. Ref. [51]) is the
underlying SO(5) structure of the former, which prescribes a speciﬁc relation between the
quartic terms in the potential as well as speciﬁc soft breaking terms. In the generic extra
singlet scenarios, the allowed parameter space is given by the entire white area in Fig. 8,
while a PNGB nature for the Higgs restricts the allowed region to the area to the right of
the curves depicted in the ﬁgure.

Finally, the impact of the heavy fermions of the model on the gluon fusion cross section
may be signiﬁcant. Using the approximate expressions in Eqs. (85) and (87), assuming that
the factor y1y2/M1M5 in Eqs. (82) and (83) is the largest contribution between 1/(4πf)2 and
1 TeV−2 (the latter will also be assumed when f 2 < 0), the results obtained are depicted in
Fig. 9. It shows that the present LHC bounds on sin2 γ can be weakened by O(30 − 50%)
with respect to the “only scalars” bounds in Fig. 8. This is due to a destructive interference
between the heavy fermions and the top loops, for the set of parameters considered. Moreover,
future searches will be much more sensitive to the heavy fermion sector as they probe smaller
mixing angles, and therefore they enter regions in parameter space where the top quark is
relatively less important to the σ phenomenology.

The 750 GeV di-photon excess
It is a natural question whether the mild 750 GeV di-photon excess observed by ATLAS [52]
and CMS [53] could be explained by the σ resonance under discussion. This is highly un-

likely because of the constraints imposed on the scalar couplings by the approximate SO(5)
symmetry of the scalar potential, as well as the uniqueness of the signal, as explained next.
Since the decay σ → γγ is loop induced, the corresponding branching ratio tends to be
very small. In order to be able to account for the excess observed, the h − σ mixing needs to
be tiny, so that for instance the W W and ZZ channels are suppressed and the loop-induced
processes may dominate the decay. This requires sin2 γ (cid:28) (mh/mσ)2 ’ 0.03, which Eq. (23)
shows to require on one side f 2 < 0 –for which the Higgs cannot be interpreted as a PNGB,
and on the other a very small and ﬁne-tuned α value as α2 ∝ β2 sin2(2γ); overall a very
unnatural scenario.
Furthermore, since the mixing is so small, the top loop essentially does not contribute
to the production and decay anymore. Hence, to obtain a large enough Γ(σ → γγ) and
Γ(σ → gg) the fermion content needs a higher multiplicity than what is assumed in this
paper, as well as large Yukawa couplings, since σ mainly couples to T1 and T5 with electric
charges 2/3. Even assuming such an extreme and extended conﬁguration, the stability of
the potential could become a very serious issue as the fermion contribution to the beta
function of the quartic couplings is negative. Additional ﬁeld content would then be possibly
required to compensate for this eﬀect, making the model extremely ad hoc. Therefore, we
ﬁnd no compelling argument to interpret the 750 GeV excess as corresponding to the σ scalar
studied here.
6 d ≤ 6 Fermionic Eﬀective Lagrangian
The linear model described is renormalizable and valid for any mass range of the fermionic
and/or scalar exotic ﬁelds. Two simplifying limits are specially interesting:
i) the heavy

connection between the linear (weak) and non-linear (strong) BSM physics scenarios: the
mσ → ∞ regime should lead to the non-linear scenarios usually explored in the literature
about composite Higgs; it will be discussed in detail in a subsequent publication [24].

When condition i) is satisﬁed, some important low-energy eﬀects (and model dependen-
cies) induced by the exotic fermions are easily inferred by integrating them out. The procedure
is quite lengthy; here only the resulting mass-dimension (d) 4, 5 and 6 eﬀective operators and
their coeﬃcients are summarized. For energies E < M, the eﬀective Lagrangian describing
the d ≤ 6 interactions of fermions with gauge and scalar ﬁelds can be written as

where the set {Oi} includes operators of dimension four (for which the induced coeﬃcients
are the leading contributions to the top and bottom Yukawa couplings), ﬁve and six. We will
use the “Warsaw basis” [54] below.
In most models (for instance in composite Higgs ones) it is reasonable to assume that
the goldstone boson scale f and the scalar vevs all satisfy f , v , vσ (cid:28) M. In what follows
we will thus assume f /M (cid:28) 1 for simplicity, while Λ ≈ M will be considered with Λ
denoting generically the composite Λi scales in Eq. (32). The light ﬁeld kinetic energies get
contributions which require wave function renormalization in order to recover canonically

The same reasoning applies to other couplings. For example the fermion-σ coupling via the
Ot
σ2hσi –see Table (3)– which are of
σ1 operator [54] would get corrections proportional to ct
higher order in the f /M expansion, and can thus be disregarded when restraining to the
leading contributions.

7 Conclusions
A composite Higgs would manifest with deviations of the Higgs couplings to fermions and
gauge vector bosons from the SM predictions. Current data about the Higgs properties are in
good agreement with the SM, but the present experimental precision still allow for deviations
at the level of 20% or more, while many channels predicted by the SM have not yet been
tested.

Completely clarifying the mechanism of electroweak breaking is one of the main goals of
particle physics today and an important role, on the theory side, is played by simple and
motivated extensions of the SM which could provide guidance in the experimental search.
To this purpose we have formulated a model where the scalar sector of the SM is minimally
extended to include an additional scalar particle σ. We are motivated by the attractive
possibility that the Higgs itself can be interpreted as a pseudo-Goldstone boson associated to
the breaking of an approximate symmetry. The most economic custodial preserving possibility
is oﬀered by a global SO(5) spontaneously broken down to SO(4), thus generating the four
components of the Higgs doublet as Goldstone bosons. Indeed this case has already been
vastly analyzed in the literature in the strongly interacting regime, either in the context of
four-dimensional models where SO(5) is nonlinearly realized or in ﬁve-dimensional models
with a warped space-time metric. The latter, weakly coupled duals to strongly coupled four-
dimensional conformal theories, are believed to provide a calculable framework for composite
Higgs models.

In our model, where a scalar ﬁveplet of SO(5) comprises both an electroweak doublet
and an extra singlet σ, the SO(5) symmetry is linearly realized and the theory is renormal-
izable. It could be viewed as the simplest UV completion in the class of models based on
the coset SO(5)/SO(4). In this way we lose generality, but we gain in calculability and pre-
dictability. We can study accurately the regime where the symmetry breaking sector is in the
perturbative regime and provide a useful interpolation between the weakly and the strongly
interacting cases. The SO(5) invariant part of the symmetry breaking sector contains just
two parameters, the symmetry breaking scale and the mass of the σ particle. In the SO(5)

36

invariant limit the Higgs particle is a true massless Goldston boson. Other two parameters,
arising from the one-loop eﬀective potential when gauge and Yukawa interactions are turned
on, break the SO(5) symmetry softly, ﬁx the relative orientation between the residual SO(4)
invariance and the SU(2) × U(1) electroweak group and provide the Higgs boson a mass.
A mixing angle γ deﬁnes the two physical mass eigenstates as mixtures of the electroweak
doublet and the singlet.

As the Higgs mass and the value of the electroweak scale are known, the scalar parameter
space is thus completely deﬁned in terms of the σ mass and sin γ. We have identiﬁed in it
the areas in which the Higgs can be considered a pseudo-Goldstone boson, resulting in two
well-diﬀerentiated regions corresponding respectively to a σ particle lighter and heavier than
the Higgs particle. The former case has phenomenological interest, but it turns out to require
ﬁne-tuned parameters in the scalar potential and indeed it would call for an explanation of
the stability of such a light σ; in consequence, we have focused most of the analysis on the
region in which the σ is heavier than the Higgs, to which the remarks that follow apply.

The UV completion of the theory would require further explanation as far as the σ particle
is light enough for the theory to remain in the perturbative realm, as the model would
have then replaced the hierarchy problem for the Higgs mass for that of the σ mass. It is
nevertheless a most useful tool to explore a dynamical origin for the Higgs and the possibility
of new degrees of freedom appearing in foreseen experiments. For heavy σ the symmetry
breaking sector becomes strongly interacting and in the limit of inﬁnite mσ we fall into
a nonlinear realization of SO(5). The couplings of the physical Higgs h to W and Z are
suppressed by cos γ, while the heavier σ state couples to W and Z with a strength proportional
to sin γ. Present data on the Higgs decay into W W require a relatively small mixing between
the Higgs ﬁeld and the new scalar, leaving however a considerable room to a departure from
the SM picture. We have also identiﬁed the diﬀerences in experimental impact of the case of
a generic singlet scalar added to the SM and the case of the approximately SO(5) invariant
scalar sector under discussion.

The scalar sector of the non-linear SO(5) σ model developed is minimal, simple and of gen-
eral validity. A signiﬁcant model dependence comes in when considering the fermion sector.
We chose to describe fermion masses within a simple realization of the partial compositeness
idea. We introduced a set of new vector-like heavy fermions, which couple to the full SO(5)
scalar ﬁveplets. Ordinary fermions do not directly interact with scalars but mix with the
heavy fermions. At low energies such a mixing gives rise to the usual Yukawa couplings and
fermion masses. To keep our model as minimal as possible, we assign the heavy fermions
to singlets and ﬁveplets. By focusing on the third generation of quarks, we introduce one
singlet and one ﬁveplet per each charge sector. Even in this minimal setup, the fermion sector
of the model brings in 14 parameters: four heavy fermion masses, four independent Yukawa
couplings and six mixing parameters. For completeness and as ﬁrst step towards a low-energy
benchmark eﬀective Lagrangian, we have separately integrated out the heavy fermions and
obtained the ensuing dimension four, ﬁve and six eﬀective operators made out of only SM
ﬁelds or σ plus SM ﬁelds, which include Yukawa and other couplings for the lighter particles.
Nevertheless, all the phenomenological analyses have been performed with dynamical heavy
fermions.

We have analyzed precision electroweak observables, globally parametrized in terms of
the S, T and Rb parameters. Concerning the scalar contribution, from an explicit one-loop
computation we recover a well-known result: a positive contribution to the S parameter
and a negative contribution to the T parameter. At variance with generic models where

37

SO(5) is nonlinearly realized, we do not have any cut-oﬀ ambiguity. In our model the extra
contributions ∆S and ∆T are ﬁnite. They vanish when sin γ goes to zero, since the scalar
σ does not couple any more to W and Z in this limit. They also vanish when h and σ have
the same mass, since in this case the angle γ loses any physical meaning. If h and σ are
close in mass, the contribution to ∆S and ∆T is reduced, compared to nonlinear realizations.
The main impact of the heavy fermion contribution is on the T parameter. Letting the
heavy fermions to be as light as 800 GeV, the lower limit from direct searches, contributions
to T of both signs as large as 0.2 in magnitude are generated by scanning the parameter
space. Positive (negative) ∆T are correlated to a sizable mixing between tL (tR) and an
electroweak singlet (doublet) heavy fermion component. Fermionic contributions to S are
typically positive and smaller, while those to Rb are mainly negative and of order few per
mil. Even the largest scalar contributions to ∆S and ∆T, obtained when sin2 γ saturates
its experimental bound and the scalar σ is very heavy, can always be compensated by the
fermionic ones for an appropriate choice of the parameters, thus keeping S and T within the
experimentally allowed region.

The Higgs production at LHC proceeds mainly via gluon fusion as in the SM. The am-
plitude comprises the usual SM contribution weighted by cos γ and an extra contribution
proportional to sin γ which decouples in the heavy fermion limit. The interference between
the two can be both constructive or destructive. The eﬀective coupling of the Higgs to a
diphoton pair is modiﬁed in a similar way. In the large mass limit for the heavy fermions
–taking the limit in such a way that the Higgs and light masses remain ﬁnite and at their
physical values– their impact can be neglected and deviations from the SM only depend on
sin γ. In particular the Higgs decay to W W allows to put the bound sin2 γ < 0.18, at 2σ.

The production of σ at the LHC can mainly proceed via vector boson fusion or gluon
fusion, the latter typically dominating for a σ mass not exceeding few TeV. There are no
direct couplings of σ to gluons but, as for the Higgs, an eﬀective coupling arises from fermion
loops. In the regime where the heavy fermions decouple the eﬀective σ coupling to gluons is
controlled by the top loop weighted by a sin γ factor. Present direct LHC searches for a scalar
particle are already sensitive to sin2 γ of order 0.1-0.2, for mσ < 600 GeV. If we combine this
result with the theoretical requirement that the Higgs behaves as a pseudo-Goldstone boson,
we can already exclude σ masses below about 500 GeV. This limit can be pushed to 900−1400
GeV by future LHC data from run 2, in the absence of any signal of new physics.

While in principle our model contains the ingredients to explain the recently observed
750 GeV diphoton excess in terms of σ production and decay into a photon pair, such an
interpretation is rather unnatural since it would involve a tuning of the parameters in the
scalar sector and, to boost both production and decay, a heavy fermion multiplicity much
larger that the one adopted in the present version. Clearly, together with the modiﬁcations
of the SM Higgs couplings, the prediction of an additional scalar, potentially observable at
the next LHC run, is the distinctive feature of our model. However, due to the mixing with
an electroweak doublet, the new particle is not expected to decay exclusively into photons
but rather into a variety of channels, much as the SM Higgs does.

A Coleman–Weinberg Potential
In Sect. 2.1 it was assumed a speciﬁc form for the SO(5) scalar potential broken to SO(4),
introducing two additional SO(5) breaking parameters α and β.
In this section we will
further motivate this assumption. Even assuming that the tree level scalar potential would
preserve the global SO(5) symmetry, the presence of a SO(5) breaking couplings in the
fermionic sector will generate at one-loop level SO(5) breaking terms through the Coleman-
Weinberg mechanism [55]. The one-loop fermionic contribution can be obtained from the
ﬁeld dependent mass matrix M as

In consequence, only the quadratically divergent piece is seen to remain SO(5) invariant, while
the rest of the potential introduces an explicit breaking of the SO(5) symmetry to SO(4), see
Eq. (106). The quadratic divergence can be thus absorbed in the parameters of the tree-level
Lagrangian, and the same holds for the SO(5) invariant component of the logarithmically
divergent terms (d1, d4 and d5). However, the presence of the d2 and d3 divergent SO(5)-
breaking terms require to add the two corresponding counterterms in the potential, so as to
obtain a renormalizable theory. These two necessary terms are those deﬁned with coeﬃcients
α and β in the potential deﬁnition Eq. (9). The gauge couplings appearing in the covariant
derivatives also break explicitly the SO(5) symmetry, but they do not induce extra one-
loop divergent contributions to the eﬀective potential, and in consequence only α and β are
required for consistency.

40

The computation of the ﬁnite part of Vloop should provide the dependence of the param-
eters on the renormalization scale 13 and should thus be equivalent to the computation of
their renormalization group equations; this task is beyond the scope of the present paper.

13The gauge bosons induce ﬁnite contributions which are usually neglected with respect to the fermionic ones,
as their relative ratio is proportional to the ratio between the mass scale for the heavy fermions and that for the
gauge bosons.
