To study the optical rotation of the polarization of light incident on multilayer systems consisting
of atomically thin conductors and dielectric multilayers we present a general method based on
transfer matrices. The transfer matrix of the atomically thin conducting layer is obtained using
the Maxwell equations. We derive expressions for the Kerr (Faraday) rotation angle and for the
ellipticity of the reﬂected (transmitted) light as a function of the incident angle and polarization
of the light. The method is demonstrated by calculating the Kerr (Faraday) angle for bilayer
graphene in the quantum anomalous Hall state placed on the top of dielectric multilayers. The
optical conductivity of the bilayer graphene is calculated in the framework of a four-band model.

INTRODUCTION

Owing to the potential applications and interesting
electronic properties, atomically thin materials have at-
tracted a strong interest in recent years. A variety of
two dimensional (2D) crystals, including graphene, boron
nitride, phosphorene, several transition metal dichalco-
genides and complex oxides, has been prepared and stud-
ied experimentally1–5. Atomically thin materials are usu-
ally fabricated and studied in multi-layer structures. For
example, monolayer graphene placed on a substrate can
hardly be observed with optical microscopy since the in-
tensity of the reﬂected light is small resulting in low con-
trast. However, as it was demonstrated in Refs. 6 and 7,
the multilayer structure shown in Fig. 1, when a dielec-
tric spacer of width d and refractive index n1 is placed
between the substrate (with refractive index n2) and the
graphene layer, can have important advantages. Namely,
by tuning the width d of the SiO2 used as spacer mate-
rial, the intensity of the reﬂected light changes drastically
and consequently the visibility of the graphene ﬂake8 is
improved. Theoretically, the optical visibility of mono-
layer and bilayer graphene deposited on a Si/SiO2 layer
substrate was also studied in Ref. 9 where it was shown
that the visibility is enhanced through a resonant trans-
mission of light due to the spacer.

Optical spectroscopies are powerful contact-free meth-
ods to study material properties. In the context of 2D
materials, e.g., Zhang et al.10 and Kuzmenko et al.11 used
infrared spectroscopy to extract the tight-binding param-
eters in bilayer graphene by ﬁtting the experimental re-
ﬂectivity spectra with the optical conductivity calculated
from the Kubo formula.
If time reversal symmetry is
broken, then the rotation of polarization of the trans-
mitted (reﬂected) light, i.e., the Faraday (Kerr) eﬀect
can be used to deduct the oﬀ-diagonal element of the
optical conductivity σxy(ω) as was shown for monolayer
graphene by Crassee et al.12 The time reversal symmetry
can be broken not only by external magnetic ﬁeld, but
also due to electron-electron interactions. Such an ex-

Kerr (Faraday) angle θK (θF). An incident light with an-

ﬂected (transmitted) on an atomic layer (AL) of material

(e.g., Si) with refractive index n2.

ample for the latter is one of the possible gapped ground
states of bilayer graphene, the so-called quantum anoma-
lous Hall (QAH) state (for a general discussion of the
possible gapped states in bilayer graphene see Ref. 13).
Nandkishore and Levitov has recently proposed that this
QAH state could be observed by measuring the Kerr ro-
tation14 in bilayer graphene samples. As an extension
of Ref. 14 the optical Hall and longitudinal conductivi-
ties of neutral bilayer graphene were calculated for four
additional gapped states by Gorbar et al.15. The mea-
surement of the Kerr (Faraday) angle has also been used
recently to study other time reversal symmetry break-
ing systems, such as cuprate superconductors16–19 and
topological insulators20,21.

According to the textbook formula16–19, the Kerr an-
gle θK for light reﬂected from a conducting half space
is proportional to the ac Hall conductivity of the con-
ductor: θK ∼ Im σxy(ω). However, this formula is no
longer valid for atomically thin materials since the thick-
ness of the atomic layer is much thinner than the optical

wavelength. For an atomic layer the relationship between
the Hall conductivity and Kerr (Faraday) angle θK (θF)
can be derived by solving the Maxwell equations on the
two sides of the atomic layer and matching solutions at
the boundary. Such a derivation is presented for bilayer
graphene in Ref. 14, for thin ﬁlms of topological insula-
tors by Tse and MacDonald22–24, and for thin ﬁlms of
topological Weyl semimetals by Kargarian et al.25 Such
calculations suggest that Kerr and Faraday angle mea-
surements can also be a useful tool to characterize het-
erostructures fabricated recently by stacking atomically
thin layers of, e.g., graphene, boron-nitride and transi-
tion metal dichalcogenides26–29. This calls for a ﬂexible
and tractable theoretical framework allowing studies of
magneto-optical properties of these multilayer systems.
To this end we develop a simple and versatile method
to determine the Kerr and Faraday angles in multilayer
systems.
In our method the rotation angle θ and the
ellipticity η of the polarization for the Kerr and Fara-
day eﬀect are calculated from the total transfer matrix
of the multilayer structure. The total transfer matrix
can always be expressed as a product of many individual
transfer matrices that can be classiﬁed into two diﬀer-
ent types: i) transfer matrices corresponding to the free
propagation in dielectric media, and ii) transfer matrices
of atomically thin layers with given electric conductivity
tensor σ. As we will show below this kind of classiﬁcation
of the possible transfer matrices makes the calculation
of polarization dependent reﬂectivity and transmittivity
simple and general. Our approach can be easily applied
to diﬀerent multilayer structures and for an arbitrary an-
gle of incidence of the electromagnetic radiation. Below
we also present analytical results for Kerr (Faraday) an-
gle which makes easier the interpretation of experimental
results. One of the important results of our work is that
the Kerr (Faraday) angle can be enhanced by properly
designing the substrate for the atomically thin materials.
To demonstrate how powerful our method is we consider
the multilayer setup shown in Fig. 1. The atomically
thin conductor is a bilayer graphene ﬂake placed on two
layers of dielectric media of refractive indices n1 and n2.
Here we only consider the QAH state of bilayer graphene
for which the Hall-conductivity σxy(ω) is ﬁnite resulting
in Kerr and Faraday rotation. Moreover, our method
to calculate the Kerr and Faraday rotation can be ap-
plied to another exotic state called ‘All’ state proposed
by Zhang et al. which breaks the chiral symmetry in
bilayer graphene30.

We note that a related approach based on the scatter-
ing matrix of the nanostructure has been used recently
to study the eﬀects of metalic surface states in topolog-
ical insulator thin ﬁlms 22–24,31. We believe, however,
that our transfer matrix method is easier to use in com-
plex nanostructures consisting of several layers with dif-
ferent optical properties. Note that the transfer matrix
method has been used for non-interacting graphene lay-
ers in Ref. 32 to study the transmission and reﬂection,
but the Kerr (Faraday) eﬀect was not considered there.

2

Thus, our work is a generalization of Ref. 32.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we de-
rive the two types of transfer matrices relevant in a mul-
tilayer structure described above. Moreover, using the
total transfer matrix the reﬂection and transmission am-
plitudes, Kerr and Faraday angles and the ellipticity are
given. In Sec. III, we present examples for the applica-
tion of our transfer matrix method, and analytical for-
mulas for the Kerr and Faraday angles for several special
cases. In order to make our work more readable the main
steps of the calculation of the conductivity tensor of the
gapped bilayer graphene is presented in Appendix A. In
Sec. IV we make our conclusions.

II. TRANSFER MATRIX METHOD FOR

CALCULATING THE KERR AND FARADAY

ANGLES

In this section we develop a general and convenient
method to calculate the Kerr and Faraday angles via the
transfer matrix of layered structures consisting of stacks
of dielectric materials and atomically thin conducting
layers, such as graphene. In general, the total transfer
matrix of such a layered structure is a product of two
types of transfer matrices. The ﬁrst one corresponds to a
free propagation in dielectric media and we shall denote
it by Mfree, the second one that gives the transfer matrix
Mb for an atomically thin material (e.g., graphene) with
electric conductivity σ.

Regarding the geometry, we now consider an atomi-
cally thin sample on the x − y plane embedded between
dielectrics with refractive indices nR and nL at the left
and right hand side of the sample, respectively as shown
in Fig. 2. This ﬁgure shows two plane waves with wave
vectors k±
L at the left hand side and two plane waves
with wave vectors k±
R at the right hand side of the in-
terface. Here the signs +/− correspond to the direction
of the propagation of the waves with respect to the z
axis. The electric ﬁelds of these plane waves at the left
and right side of the interface are denoted by subscript R
and L, respectively. The superscripts of these ﬁelds are
further distinguished by s/p corresponding to the s/p
polarized ﬁelds, i.e., the direction of the ﬁeld is perpen-
dicular/parallel to the plane of incidence, respectively.
The transfer matrix Mb connects the electric ﬁelds at
the left hand side with that of the right hand side of the
interface:

and from that the transfer matrix Mb can be extracted.
Namely, from rotE = − ∂B
∂t and j = σ E
it follows that

ˆnz × (E> − E<) = 0,
ˆnz × (H> − H<) = σ E,

where ˆnz is the unit vector along the z axes, E</E> is
the electric ﬁeld at the left/right hand side of the inter-
face. The magnetic ﬁeld of the plane wave in a dielectric
is related to the electric ﬁeld as H = q εr ε0
|k| × E.
For the refractive index n of a dielectric medium we take
n = √εr since for dielectric the relative permeability con-
stant is µr ≈ 1. Now, from Eq. (2) we can extract the 4
by 4 transfer matrix Mb deﬁned in Eq. (1) and ﬁnd

and the angles ϑR and ϑL satisfy the Snell’s law:
nR sin ϑR = nL sin ϑL. Here the dimensionless conduc-
tivity σ is in units of e2/h and α = e2/(4πε0c0) ≈ 1/137
is the ﬁne-structure constant.
One can show that the determinant of the matrix Mb

is given by

nR cos ϑR(cid:19)2
det Mb =(cid:18) nL cos ϑL

Note that it is independent of the conductivity σ.

The transfer matrix for free propagation in a dielectric

where k is the wave number in the dielectric, d is the
thickness of the dielectric medium and ϑ is the angle
between the direction of the propagation and the z axes.
Note that det Mfree = 1.

The total transfer matrix is given by the appropriate
product of the two building blocks, Mb and Mfree. For
example the total transfer matrix for the layered struc-
ture shown in Fig. 1 reads as

Mtotal = Mb(n2, n1, 0) Mfree(d) Mb(n1, n0, σ).

(6)

Here for brevity, we have omitted the dependence of an-
gles ϑ0, ϑ1 and ϑ2 in two matrices Mb.

The reﬂection amplitude r and the transmission am-
plitude t can be extracted from the total transfer matrix
Mtotal in the following way. Consider an incident plane
wave which is a superposition of the linear s and p po-
i )T . Now the reﬂection and
larized light, Ei = (Es

i , Ep

transmission amplitudes can be represented by 2 by 2
matrices:

r =(cid:18) rss rsp

rps rpp (cid:19) ,

t =(cid:18) tss tsp

tps tpp (cid:19) ,

(7a)

and the reﬂected rEi and the transmitted waves tEi sat-
isfy the following equation:

(7b)

(8a)

(8b)

(cid:18) tEi

0 (cid:19) = Mtotal(cid:18) Ei

rEi (cid:19) .

Hence, it is easy to obtain
r = −(M22)−1 M21,
t = M11 + M12r = M11 − M12 (M22)−1 M21
=(cid:2)(cid:0)M−1(cid:1)11(cid:3)−1

,

where the 4 by 4 matrix Mtotal is partitioned in the same
way as in Eq. (3a), i.e.,

Mtotal =  M11 M12

M21 M22 ! .

Note that when there is no dissipation, i.e., σxx = σyy =
0 and σxy = −σyx then the unitarity is valid:

r+r +

nR cos ϑR
nL cos ϑL

t+ t = 11,

(9)

where 11 is a 2 by 2 unit matrix. The reﬂectance R and
the transmittance T for incident light Ei are deﬁned as

T =

(10b)

Owing to the dissipation in the atomically thin conduc-
tor, some of the incident light is absorbed, and then the
absorption A is given by

A = 1 − R − T.

(11)

Finally, according to the textbook by Born and Wolf33
the polarization rotation (Kerr angle) θK and the ellip-
ticity ηK for the reﬂected wave can be written in the form

4

For |χK| ≪ 1 Eq. (12a) implies that the Kerr angle is
given by θK ≈ ReχK. Similar expressions are valid for
the polarization rotation θF (Faraday angle) and the el-
lipticity ηF in the case of transmitted wave, just r should
be replaced by t in Eq. (12).

For dielectrics (σ = 0) our transfer matrix method
gives the same results as derived, e.g., in the classical
textbook by Born and Wolf33. If the Hall conductivity
σxy is zero then no polarization rotation emerges, i.e., the
Kerr and Faraday angles are zeros. Regarding single and
bilayer graphene our method results in the same reﬂec-
tion and transmission amplitudes as used by Kuzmenko
et al.11

III. APPLICATIONS OF THE TRANSFER

MATRIX METHOD

In this section using our general transfer matrix
method presented in Sec. II we calculate the Kerr ro-
tation angle for the geometrical arrangement shown in
Fig. 1. To obtain simple analytical results useful for
measurements we consider two special cases here:
i)
the atomic layer is placed directly on a substrate, i.e.,
the middle dielectric medium with refractive index n1 in
Fig. 1 is removed. ii) the incident light is perpendicular
to the plane of the atomic layer. Since in our applications
the Kerr/Faraday angle is small, i.e., θK/F ≪ 1 we use
the approximation θK/F ≈ ReχK/F.
To study numerically the Kerr eﬀect we need to know
the frequency dependence of the optical conductivity. As
an example we take the bilayer gapped graphene and
calculate its optical conductivity using our previously de-
veloped method34. To make this paper self-contained, in
App. A we brieﬂy summarize the main steps to obtain
the conductivity. We also compare our results with those
found in Refs. 14 and 15 and present some numerical re-
sults for bilayer graphene in the QAH state.

A. Atomic layer on a thick substrate

In this case the total transfer matrix is simply Mtotal =
Mb(n2, ϑ2, n0, ϑ0, σ) where Mb(n2, ϑ2, n0, ϑ0, σ) is given
by Eq. (3). The Kerr angle is given by

Here ϑ0 is the angle of the incident light, and in this sub-
section the superscript s and the upper sign refer to s
polarization, while the superscript p and the lower sign
refer to p polarization. At this point it is worth to con-
sider a few special cases of the general formula given by
Eq. (13).

This result agrees with that derived by Nandkishore and

where in the last step we assumed that σxx is approxi-
mately equal to π in units of e2/h (see, e.g., Ref. 35 and
our result shown in Fig. 6a) and we neglected the term
proportional to α in the denominator. Figure 3a shows
a relatively large Kerr angle plotted as a function of fre-
quency of the incident light for s and p polarization with
oblique incidence.

that are proportional to α or α2 we have

where ϑB = arctan (n2/n0) (note that now γ = n0/n2).
In the last step we neglected the term proportional to α.
For s polarization the Kerr angle is much smaller as can
be seen in Fig. 3b.

In what follows we argue that the sensitivity of the
detection of the Kerr rotation can be enhanced when
the incident angle is close to the Brewster angle. To
see this, we calculated the frequency dependence of the
optical conductivity for bilayer graphene assuming that
the ground state is the QAH state. (The details of this
calculation can be found in Appendix A.) Using this re-
sult we then obtained the Kerr angle as a function of the

angle of incidence ϑ0 as shown in Fig. 3b. As it can be
seen the Kerr angle θK is strongly enhanced for p polar-
ization when ϑ0 = ϑB. However, using Eq. (10) one can
ﬁnd that at this angle the intensity of the reﬂected wave
signiﬁcantly drops down. Thus, for an optical study of
graphene or other atomically thin conducting layers the
optimal incident angle should be close but not exactly
equal to the Brewster angle.

and k = ω n1/c is the wave number in the dielectric with
refractive index n1 and ω is the frequency of the incident
light. Here (in contrast to Sec. III A) the upper/lower
signs are only introduced to make the expressions more
compact.

We now argue that in this setup an appropriate choice
of substrate thickness d makes the detection of θK eas-
ier in a somewhat similar way as in monolayer graphene
ﬂakes where the visibility is enhanced 26,27. We again
consider only the QAH state of bilayer graphene and
calculate the dependence of the Kerr angle on the fre-
quency ω and the thickness d of the SiO2 dielectric. The
substrate is made of Si and the electromagnetic wave
incident perpendicular to the interface comes from vac-
uum (n0 = 1). The optical Hall conductivity of the bi-
layer graphene is calculated at zero chemical potential
and temperature (see Appendix A for details). The re-
sults for Kerr angle θK are shown in Fig. 4. One can see
from Fig. 4 that the Kerr angle is enhanced along cer-
tain lines on the d − ω plane. This is a consequence of
the Fabry-Perot type resonance. Indeed, from Eq. (18)
we can derive an approximate analytical expression for
the resonance condition, which is given by b+b− = 0,
i.e., the ﬁrst term in the denominator vanishes. Note,
that the second term in the denominator is proportional
to the square of the ﬁne-structure constant and there-
fore it is generally a small term. Using the deﬁnitions
of b± given by Eq. (18) the condition b+b− = 0 leads to

where N is an integer. For SiO2 layer (n1 = 1.5, see
Ref. 36) and Si substrate (n2 = 3.5, see Ref. 37) the
above condition n1 = √n0 n2 cannot be satisﬁed per-
fectly. Nevertheless, it is clearly seen in Fig. 4 that θK is
strongly enhanced along lines where Eq. (19b) is approx-
imately satisﬁed.

As a brief summary of our ﬁndings in Secs. III A and
III B regarding the Kerr angle, the following conclusions
can be drawn:

i) According to Eq. (15) the real part of the Hall con-
ductivity σxy for free-standing graphene can directly be
determined by measuring the relatively large Kerr angle.
ii) From Eq. (17) it follows that the Kerr angle can be
enhanced when the atomically thin material is placed on
a bare substrate and the incident angle ϑ0 of the light is
close to the Brewster angle ϑB.

iii) If the atomically thin material and the substrate
are separated by a dielectric slab then owing to a Fabry-
Perot type resonance the Kerr angle can be enhanced if
the frequency of the incident light is tuned according to
Eq. (19).

C. Faraday eﬀect for atomic layer on a thick

substrate

In this section we consider the same multilayer struc-
ture as in shown Fig. 1. except that the dielectric medium
with refractive index n2 is replaced by vacuum. We con-
sider that the incident light coming from the vacuum is
perpendicular to the conducting sheet. Using the theory
outlined in Sec. II one can derive the following simple
analytical expression for the Faraday angle θF.

θF = −Re(cid:20) σxy (a+ + a−)
(cid:21) , where
b+ − b−
a± = e±ikd (n1 ∓ n0) ,
b± = e±ikd (n0 ∓ n1) (n0 ∓ n1 + σxx) ,

(20a)

(20b)

(20c)

and k = ω n1/c is the wave number in the dielectric with
refractive index n1 and ω is the frequency of the incident
light. Here (in contrast to Sec. III A) the upper/lower
signs are only introduced to make the expressions more
compact.

As in Sections III A and III B for our numerical calcu-
lations we take bilayer graphene in QAH state. Figure 5
shows the Faraday angle θF as a function of the frequency
ω and the thickness d of the substrate for perpendicular
incidence. The enhancement of the Faraday angle that
can be seen in Fig. 5 is consequence of the local extrema
of σxy as a function of ω (see Fig. 6b in Appendix A).

FIG. 5. (Color online) The Faraday angle as a function of ω
and the thickness d for a bilayer graphene sheet placed on a
substrate of refractive index n1 = 1.5 and at perpendicular
incidence. The parameters: γ1 = 0.4 eV, η = 0.05 eV, n0 = 1.

However, this angle is still smaller by one order of magni-
tude than the maximum values of the Kerr angle shown
in Fig. 4. Thus, measuring the Kerr angle is more suit-
able than the Faraday angle to explore whether the time
reversal symmetry is broken or not in bilayer graphene.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we developed a general and versatile ap-
proach to calculate the rotation of the polarization of re-
ﬂected and transmitted light (Kerr and Faraday eﬀects)
that is incident on multilayer systems consisting of atom-
ically thin conducting layers and dielectrics. Introducing
two kinds of transfer matrices as building blocks pro-
vides a powerful method to determine the transfer ma-
trix of such multilayers in a simple and systematic way.
From the transfer matrix we presented expressions for
the intensity of the reﬂected and transmitted light, and
the rotation angle and ellipticity of the light polarization.
The expressions of these quantities are also applicable for
oblique incidence of light. As an example we considered
a geometrical arrangement of the multilayers as shown in
Fig. 1 and for several special cases we derived analytical
results for the Kerr angle. In particular, we found that
if the angle of incidence is close to the Brewster angle
the Kerr angle is enhanced allowing easier detection. We
would like to emphasize that these analytic results can
be applied to any 2D conducting materials layered with
dielectrics.

In our numerical calculations the atomically thin con-
ducting layer is taken to be a bilayer graphene using a
four-band model. The measurement of the Kerr and/or
Faraday rotation provides a simple optical method to de-

7

termine whether the ground state is the quantum anoma-
lous Hall state characterized by spontaneously broken
time-reversal symmetry or not14,15. Our newly devel-
oped transfer matrix method is an eﬃcient procedure to
design such multilayer structures in which the Kerr an-
gle can be enhanced. As an example we showed that the
Kerr angle can be maximized by tuning the thickness of
the SiO2 layer.

We believe that our work for calculating the Kerr and
Faraday rotations can be applied to interpret and design
experiments on complex multilayers consisting of atomi-
cally thin conducting materials and dielectrics.

Appendix A: Calculation of the optical conductivity

for gapped bilayer graphene

To calculate the optical conductivity of any 2D ma-
terial we applied our general method developed earlier
in Ref. 34.
In this approach we start with an arbi-
trary multi band system described by a matrix Hamil-
tonian in a Bloch wavefunction basis: Hab(k), where
a, b = 1, 2,··· N are the band indices (here N is the num-
ber of bands of the system). Here each matrix element
Hab(k) is a diﬀerentiable function of the wave number k
corresponding to the Bloch states.

As an example we take the same four-band model of
gapped bilayer graphene that is used by Gorbar et al. in
Ref. 15. This was an extension of the two-band model
used by Nandkishore et al.
in Ref. 14 to describe the
broken symmetry in bilayer graphene at low energy. The
4 by 4 Hamiltonian is given by

(A1)

where k± = kx ± iky, and ξ = ±1 and s = ±1 are
valley and spin quantum numbers, respectively, while
vF ≈ 106 m/s is the Fermi velocity and γ1 = 0.38 eV
is the strongest interlayer hopping. Here the most gen-
eral gap reads as

∆ξs = U + sUT + ξ∆T + ξs∆,

(A2)

where U , UT , ∆ and ∆T are constants related to diﬀerent
gapped ground states.

The four eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian (A1) are

E1,2(k) = E±(k) and E3,4(k) = −E2,1(k), where

(A3)
while x = (vF k)2 and k is the magnitude of the wave
vector k = (kx, ky).

In general the complex optical conductivity σij (ω) can
be calculated from the current-current correlation func-
tion Πij (iνm) using the usual analytic continuation38
iνm → ω + iη, and it is given by

σij (ω) =

ie2
2ω

Πij (iνm → ω + iη),

(A4)

where i, j = x, y and η is the inverse lifetime of the par-
ticle. To calculate the current-current correlation func-
tion we applied our general method developed earlier in
Ref. 34 in the usual bubble approximation. To this end

it is useful to write the Hamiltonian as H = Pa EaQa,
where Qa = |aiha| are the projector operators, and
Ea and |ai are the eigenenergies and the correspond-
ing eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian H, and in our case
a = 1, 2, 3, 4. The projectors Qa satisfy the usual rela-
tion QaQb = δab Qa. Then the current-current correla-
tion function Πij (iνm) with current operator J = ∂H
∂k (in
units of e/ which is taken into account in the expression
of the conductivity) reads

Πij (iνm) =

(A5a)

(A5b)

where nF (E) = 1/(eβE + 1) is the usual Fermi distribu-
tion and the trace is taken over the band indices. Note
that to calculate the function Kab(iνm) we have used the
usual summation techniques over the Matsubara’s fre-
quencies38. Here we would like to emphasize that the pro-
jector operators Qa can be calculated without knowing
the eigenvectors |ai of the Hamiltonian H. Indeed, let H
be an N ×N hermitian matrix with s ≤ N distinct eigen-
values, Ea, . . . , Es, and then the matrix H can be decom-
posed in terms of projector matrices as H = Pa EaQa,

where the projector matrix Qa for a = 1, . . . , s (in the
mathematical literature called Frobenius covariant39) is
given by

Qa =

Yb=1

b6=a

H − Eb IN
Ea − Eb

,

(A6)

where IN is the N × N unit matrix. The proof of (A6) is
based on the Cayley-Hamilton theorem39,40. This the-

8

orem greatly simpliﬁes the calculation of the current-
current correlation function both analytically and nu-
merically. Moreover, one can avoid to evaluate the spec-
tral function of the Green’s function used for example by
Nicol and Carbotte in Ref. 35.

In particular, for Hamiltonian (A1) we ﬁnd the corre-
lation function for chemical potential µ = 0 and at zero
temperature

while σyy(ω) = σxx(ω) and σyx(ω) = −σxy(ω).

At this point the above form of the conductivity ten-
sor is valid for arbitrary gap parameters U , UT , ∆ and
∆T . From now on we take U = UT = ∆ = 0 and for
∆T we use the same value as in Ref. 15. We plotted the
real and imaginary part of the complex longitudinal op-
tical conductivity σxx given by Eq. (A9a) (see Fig. 6a),
and the real and imaginary part of the complex opti-
cal Hall-conductivity σxy calculated from Eq. (A9b) (see
Fig. 6b). Furthermore, we also compare our result with
that obtained by Nandkishore and Levitov using the sim-
pliﬁed two-band model for bilayer graphene14 (see the
gray dash-dot line in Fig. 6b). As can be seen from
Fig. 6b the result from the two-band model agrees well

with our four-band calculations.

Note that the current-current correlation function ob-
tained from Eq. (A7) agrees exactly with that obtained
by Gorbar et al. using a diﬀerent method15. However,
the conductivity in Eq. (A9) diﬀers from that given in
Ref. 15 by a factor (ω + iη)/ω. As can be shown nu-
merically this analytic diﬀerence is relevant only at low
frequencies, namely for ω / η.

Note that as a check of our calculation of the optical

conductivity it can be shown that
