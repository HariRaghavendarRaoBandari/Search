WELLPOSEDNESS AND DECAY RATES FOR THE CAUCHY PROBLEM
OF THE MOORE-GIBSON-THOMPSON EQUATION ARISING IN HIGH

INTENSITY ULTRASOUND

M. PELLICER1 AND B. SAID-HOUARI2

Abstract. In this paper, we study the Moore–Gibson–Thompson equation in RN , which
is a third order in time equation that arises in viscous thermally relaxing ﬂuids and also in
viscoelastic materials (then under the name of standard linear viscoelastic model). First, we
use some Lyapunov functionals in the Fourier space to show that, under certain assumptions
on some parameters in the equation, an energy norm related with the solution decays with
a rate (1 + t)−N/4. But this does not give the decay rate of the solution itself. Hence, in the
second part of the paper, we show an explicit representation of the solution in the frequency
domain by analyzing the eigenvalues of the Fourier image of the solution and writing the
solution accordingly. We use this eigenvalues expansion method to give the decay rate of the
solution (and its derivatives), which (for the solution) results in (1 + t)1−N/4 for N = 1, 2
and (1 + t)1/2−N/4 when N ≥ 3.

Keywords: Moore-Gibson-Thompson equation, decay rate, Fourier transform, energy

method, eigenvalues expansion method.

1. Introduction, derivation of the model and well-posedness.

Acoustic is an active ﬁeld of research which is concerned with the generation and space-
time evolution of small mechanical perturbations in ﬂuid (sound waves) or in solid (elastic
waves). One of the important equations in nonlinear acoustics is the Kuznetsov equation:

where u represents the acoustic velocity potential, and b, c, and B/A are the diﬀusivity and
speed of sound, and the nonlinearity parameter, respectively. The derivation of equation
(1.1) can be obtained from the general equations of ﬂuid mechanics but we include a brief
summary of its derivation, that can be found with more details in [12], [22] or [4] and the
references therein, for instance. It is based on the relations coming from the conservation of
mass, conservation of momentum and entropy balance in the model of thermo-viscous ﬂow
in a compressible ﬂuid:

• the equation of conservation of energy (ﬁrst law of thermodynamics):

(vt + (v · ∇)v) = ∇ · T,

θ(ηt + (v · ∇)η) = −∇ · q + T : D.

In the previous equations we are considering v, p and η as the velocity, pressure and speciﬁc
entropy of the acoustic particle, and  and q as mass density and the heat ﬂux vector,
respectively. Also, D is the deformation or strain tensor given by

and T is the Cauchy–Poisson stress tensor given by

D =

T = (−p + λ(∇ · v))I + 2µD,

where I is the identity matrix, µ is the shear viscosity (the ﬁrst coeﬃcient of viscosity) and
λ = ζ− 2
3µ, where ζ is the second coeﬃcient of viscosity (the bulk viscosity). The components
of T : D are TijDij, where Tij, Dij are the components of T and D, respectively.

It can be seen (see the above references for the details) that equations (1.3) and (1.4) can

be rewritten as

(1.5)

and

(1.6)

respectively.

(vt + (v · ∇)v) = −∇p + µ∆v + (ζ + µ/3)∇(∇ · v)

θ(ηt + (v · ∇)η) = 2µD : D + λ(∇ · v)2 − ∇ · q,

The previous equations, together with (1.2) and the following equations of state

p = p(, η),

θ = θ(, η)

are the Navier Stokes equations.

First, we assume that the deviation of , p, η and θ from their equilibrium values 0, p0, η0
and θ0 is small. By taking the Taylor series expansion of (1.7) around values at rest 0 and
η0 and ignoring the higher order terms, we get

By assuming that the ﬂow is rotation free, that is ∇ × v = 0, and introducing the acoustic
velocity potential v = −∇u, then it has been shown in [14] and [4], that equation (1.1), can
be derived from the above set of equations by assuming the Fourier law of heat conduction

(1.9)

q = −K∇θ,

where K is the thermal conductivity and θ is the absolute temperature. It is known that
by modeling heat conduction with the Fourier law (1.9), which assumes the ﬂux q to be
proportional to the gradient of the temperature ∇θ at the same time t, leads to the paradox
of inﬁnite heat propagation speed (that is, any thermal disturbance at a single point has
an instantaneous eﬀect everywhere in the medium) and also fails when q increases or ∇θ
decreases (see [10]). To overcome this drawback, a number of modiﬁcations of the basic
assumption on the relation between the heat ﬂux and the temperature have been made, such
as the Maxwell–Cattaneo law, the Gurtin–Pipkin theory, the Jeﬀreys law, the Green–Naghdi
theory and others. The common feature of these theories is that all permit transmission
of heat ﬂow as thermal waves at ﬁnite speed. See [2, 11] for more details. One of these
laws is the Maxwell–Cattaneo law, that assumes the following relation between heat ﬂux and
temperature:

(1.10)

τ qt + q = −K∇θ,

where τ is the relaxation time of the heat ﬂux (usually small). By considering (1.10), instead
of (1.9) and combining it with the equations of ﬂuid mechanics, we get, instead of (1.1), the
Jordan–Moore–Gibson–Thompson equation (see [10])

where b = δ + τ c2, with δ being the diﬀusivity of sound.

In this paper we consider the linearized version of equation (1.11), known as the Moore–

Gibson–Thompson equation in the acoustics theory:

(1.12)

τ uttt + utt − c2∆u − b∆ut = 0.

This linear equation is an active ﬁeld of research. It also arises in viscous thermally relaxing
ﬂuids and has applications in medical and industrial use of high intensity ultrasound such
as lithotripsy, thermotherapy or ultrasound cleaning (see [16]). But it also appears in vis-
coelasticity theory under the name of standard linear model of vicoelasticity (sometimes also
called Kelvin or Zener model) to explain the behaviour of certain viscoelastic materials (that
is, that exhibit both a viscous ﬂuid and an elastic solid response) such as, for instance, ﬂuids
with complex microestructure (see [15]). In this context, u represents the linear deforma-
tions of a viscoelastic solid with an approach that is considered to be more realistic than the
usual Kelvin-Voigt model. Actually, this model seems to be the simplest one that reﬂects
both creeping and stress relaxation eﬀects in viscoelastic materials (see [6] or [21] for more
details).

The derivation of equation (1.12) in R in the context of viscoelasticity theory can be
obtained in the following way. Let us recall that in viscoelasticity theory, springs and dashpots
represent the elastic and viscous components of the materials, respectively. According to [7],
[1] or [6], among others, in the one dimensional case this equation represents a linear spring
connected in series with a Kelvin-Voigt system, that is, another linear spring connected in
parallel with a dashpot. This is a common way of approaching viscoelastic systems using a

4

M. PELLICER1 AND B. SAID-HOUARI2

rheological point of view. Using this formulation (see again [7], [1] or [6] for more details), it
is easy to see that such a system is governed by the following relation

(1.13)

σ + τ σ(cid:48) = E(e + βe(cid:48)),

where σ is the stress and e is the strain. According to [6], τ is the stress relaxation time under
constant strain, β is the strain relaxation time under constant stress and E is the relaxed
elastic modulus. In any case, all of them are parameters involving the elastic and viscous
constants of the material. More concretely, if η stands for the dashpot viscosity coeﬃcient,
and E1, E2 represent the Young modulus of the ﬁrst and second elastic springs respectively,
one has that

(1.14)

τ =

η

E1 + E2

,

E =

E1E2

E1 + E2

,

β =

η
E2

.

However, there are a few references in which the standard linear model is described as a linear
spring connected in parallel with a Maxwell model, that is, a spring and a dashpot connected
in series (see for instance [18], where this model is also called the 3-parameter model). In
this case, the relation between the stress and strain of the system is also (1.13), but the
parameters are

(1.15)

τ =

η
E2

,

E = E1,

β =

η
E1

+

η

.

In both descriptions of the standard viscoelastic model, as relation (1.13) is the same, the
corresponding equation would be

τ uttt + utt − E
ρ

(uxx + βutxx) = 0,

where ρ represents the longitudinal density of the material. This equation is obtained thinking
our material as a sequence of increasingly series-coupled systems of (1.13) type, that is, a
continuous model with (1.13) as single component (see Chapter 6 of [5] or Section 2 of [19]
for a similar deduction on diﬀerent models).

In [7], [1] or [20] it is assumed that 0 < τ < β (dissipative system), with τ, β being small
constants. Observe that in both descriptions of the parameters (1.14) and (1.15) this is a
natural assumption:
in (1.14) it is fulﬁlled unless η = 0 (no dashpot), E1 = 0 (only the
Kelvin-Voigt sytem) or E2 = ∞ (inﬁnitely rigid second spring) ,while in (1.14) it is fulﬁlled
unless η = 0 (no dashpot) or E1 = ∞ (inﬁnitely rigid ﬁrst spring). In all these particular
cases, we would obtain the conservative case τ = β. The case τ > β is treated in [3], where
the authors show the chaotic behaviour of the corresponding solution.

The initial boundary value problem associated to (1.12) has been studied recently by many
authors in bounded domains. In [12] (see also [13]), the authors considered the linearized
equation

τ uttt + αutt + c2Au + bAut = 0

(1.16)
where A is a positive self-adjoint operator, and showed that by neglecting diﬀusivity of the
sound coeﬃcient (b = 0) there arises a lack of existence of a semigroup associated with the
linear dynamics. On the other hand, they showed that when the diﬀusivity of the sound is
strictly positive (b > 0), the linear dynamics are described by a strongly continuous semigroup,
which is exponentially stable provided that γ = α − τ c2/b > 0, while if γ = 0 the energy is
conserved (the same type of results are obtained in [1] or [7] using energy methods, or in [17]
using the analysis of the spectrum of the operator). The exponential decay rate results in [17]

MOORE-GIBSON-THOMPSON EQUATION IN RN

5

are completed in [20], where the obtention of an explicit scalar product where the operator
is normal allows the authors to obtain the optimal exponential decay rate of the solutions.
Finally, in [3], the authors show the caotic behaviour of the system when γ > 0, as we have
mentioned above.
Observe that in this third order in time equation, the strong damping term bAut is respon-
sible for the well-posedness of the problem, while in the wave equation with strong damping
(τ = 0) the strong damping term is responsible for the analiticity of the semigroup.

We also mention the recent paper [15] where the authors consider (1.16) with a memory
damping term and show an exponential decay of the energy provided that the kernel is
exponentially decaying. This result is generalized in [16], where it is shown that the memory
kernel decay determines the solution decay.

To the best of our knowledge, these equations have not been studied yet in an unbounded
domain. So, the goal of this paper is to show the well-posedness and investigate the decay
rate of the solutions of the Moore–Gibson–Thompson equation in an unbounded domain.
Namely, we consider the equation

(1.17)

τ uttt + utt − c2∆u − c2β∆ut = 0

in RN ,

t > 0,

with the following initial data

(1.18)

u (x, 0) = u0 (x) ,

ut (x, 0) = u1 (x) ,

utt (x, 0) = u2 (x) .

In addition, we assume that 0 < τ < β, which corresponds to the dissipative case.

In order to state and prove our results, let us ﬁrst and without loss of generality, take c = 1.
We ﬁrst observe the well-posedness of (1.17) with initial data in H s(RN ), s ≥ 1. This can
be seen using the result of [12] (also [17]) after applying the following change of variables to
the equation (1.17):

u = e−γt v

with γ > 0. After this change of variables we obtain the equation

τ vttt + γ0vtt − γ1∆v − γ2∆vt + γ3v + γ4vt = 0

in RN ,

t > 0,

(1.19)

with

γ0 = 1 − 3γτ, γ1 = c2(1 − βγ), γ2 = c2β, γ3 = γ2(1 − γτ ), γ4 = −γ(2 − 3γτ ).

Observe that γi > 0 for i = 1, 2, 3 if γ is small enough. After rearranging terms, equation
(1.19) can be written as

(1.20)

The two main results we obtain for the decay rate of this equation can be seen in Theorems
2.6 and 4.1 (and 4.2) below. First, in Section 2 and using the energy method in the Fourier

space, we show that, if τ < β, the energy norm of V and of its higher-order derivatives ∂j
with V = (τ utt + ut, ∂x(τ ut + u), ∂xut), decay as

xV ,

(1.21)

xV0(cid:107)L2,

for a certain c > 0 (see Theorem 2.6). The decay rate in (1.21) is a direct consequence of the
estimate of the Fourier image ˆV (x, t):

| ˆV (ξ, t)|2 ≤ Ce−cρ(ξ)t| ˆV (ξ, 0)|2,

ρ(ξ) =

|ξ|2
1 + |ξ|2

which we derive using the Lyapunov functional method (see Proposition 2.1). This method
is a very powerful tool in proving the decay rate of the energy norm (see [8, 9]). But,
unfortunately, it is obvious that the estimate (1.21) does not give us any information about
the decay of the solution u(x, t) itself. It only gives us the decay rate of the energy norm which
eventually follows the decay rate of the slowest component of the vector V . So, to overcome
this limitation of the Lyapunov functional method, we use the eigenvalues expansion method,
which is based essentially on the behavior of the eigenvalues of the equation in the Fourier
space.
In Section 3 we give a complete description of the solutions of the characteristic
equation of the corresponding operator and use it to divide the frequency domain into three
main parts (low frequency, middle frequency and high frequency regions) and estimate the
Fourier image of the solution in each region.
In Section 4 and using this method, we are
able to prove our second main result, which is the following decay rate of the solution of
(1.17)-(1.18) when 0 < τ < β with initial data in L1(RN )∩ H s(RN ), s ≥ 1 (see Theorem 4.1):

(cid:13)(cid:13)∂j
xu (t)(cid:13)(cid:13)L2 ≤ C((cid:107)u0(cid:107)L1 + (cid:107)u1(cid:107)L1 + (cid:107)u2(cid:107)L1)(1 + t)1−N/4−j/2
(cid:13)(cid:13)∂j
xu (t)(cid:13)(cid:13)L2 ≤ C((cid:107)u0(cid:107)L1 + (cid:107)u1(cid:107)L1 + (cid:107)u2(cid:107)L1)(1 + t)−(N−2)/4−j/2

(1.22)
(for certain c, C > 0 and 0 ≤ j ≤ s) and even better estimates if N + j ≥ 3 (see Theorem
4.2):

xu2(cid:107)L2)e−ct

(1.23)
For initial data in the weighted space L1,1(RN ) ∩ H s(RN ), s ≥ 1, the above estimates will be
improved (see Theorem 4.4 for more details).

To summarize, the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we use
the energy method in the Fourier space to build an appropriate Lyapunov functional, that is
used to derive the decay rate of the energy norm explained above. Section 3 is devoted to
the eigenvalues expansion method, that is used in Section 4 to derive the decay rate of the
solution and its spacial derivatives.

2. Energy method in the Fourier space

In this section, we apply the energy method in the Fourier space to show the decay rate
of the energy-norm of V = (τ utt + ut, ∂x(τ ut + u), ∂xut), where u(x, t) is the solution of
(1.17)-(1.18).

First, we can write the problem in the Fourier space taking the Fourier transform of equation
(1.17) and the initial data (1.18). We then obtain the following ODE initial value problem:

(2.1)

and

τ ˆuttt + ˆutt + |ξ|2 ˆu + β|ξ|2 ˆut = 0

(2.2)
with ξ ∈ RN . Introducing the new variables

ˆu (ξ, 0) = u0 (ξ) ,

ˆut (ξ, 0) = ˆu1 (ξ) ,

ˆutt (ξ, 0) = ˆu2 (ξ)

the previous ODE can be rewritten as the following ﬁrst order system

We can write the previous system in a matrix form as
ˆUt(ξ, t) = Φ(ξ) ˆU (ξ, t),

(2.4)

with the initial data

ˆU0(ξ) = ˆU (ξ, 0),

where ˆU (ξ, t) = (ˆu(ξ, t), ˆv(ξ, t), ˆw(ξ, t))T and

Now we deﬁne the vector V = (τ utt + ut, ∂x(τ ut + u), ∂xut). Thus, the pointwise estimate

of the Fourier image of V reads as follows.

Proposition 2.1. Let ˆu be the solution of (2.1)-(2.2). Assume that τ < β. Then, the Fourier
image of the above vector V satisﬁes the estimate

(2.6)
for all t ≥ 0 and certain c, C > 0, where

| ˆV (ξ, t)|2 ≤ Ce−cρ(ξ)t| ˆV (ξ, 0)|2,

(2.7)

ρ(ξ) =

|ξ|2
1 + |ξ|2 .

The proof of Proposition 2.1 will be given through some lemmas, where a certain Lyapunov

functional is obtained and used. First, we may rewrite system (2.3) as

 ˆut = ˆv,

ˆvt = ˆw,
τ ˆwt = −|ξ|2 ˆu − β|ξ|2ˆv − ˆw.

Lemma 2.2. The energy functional associated to system (2.8) is

Proof. Summing up the second and the third equation in (2.8) we get

(2.11)
Multiplying (2.11) by ¯ˆv + τ ¯ˆw and taking the real parts, we obtain,

(ˆv + τ ˆw)t = −|ξ|2 ˆu − β|ξ|2ˆv.

|ˆv + τ ˆw|2 = −τ|ξ|2 Re(ˆu ¯ˆw) − βτ|ξ|2 Re(ˆv ¯ˆw) − |ξ|2 Re(ˆu¯ˆv) − β|ξ|2|ˆv|2.

(2.12)
Next, multiplying the second equation in (2.8) by τ (β − τ )¯ˆv and taking the real part, we get

|ˆv|2 = τ (β − τ ) Re( ˆw¯ˆv).

Now, multiplying the second equation in (2.8) by τ and adding the result to the ﬁrst equation,
we obtain

(2.14)
Multiplying (2.14) by ¯ˆu + τ ¯ˆv and taking the real parts, we get

(ˆu + τ ˆv)t = τ ˆw + ˆv.

|ˆu + τ ˆv|2 = τ Re( ˆw¯ˆu) + τ 2 Re( ˆw¯ˆv) + Re(ˆv¯ˆu) + τ|ˆv|2.

(2.15)
Now, computing |ξ|2(2.15) + |ξ|2(2.13) + (2.12), we obtain (2.10), which ﬁnishes the proof of

Now, we deﬁne the functional F1(ξ, t) as

(2.16)

F1(ξ, t) = Re(cid:8)(¯ˆu + τ ¯ˆv)(ˆv + τ ˆw)(cid:9) .

Then, we have the following lemma.

Lemma 2.3. For any 0 > 0, we have

F1(ξ, t) + (1 − 0)|ξ|2|ˆu + τ ˆv|2 ≤ |ˆv + τ ˆw|2 + C(0)|ξ|2|ˆv|2.

Proof. Multiplying equation (2.11) by ¯ˆu+τ ¯ˆv and equation (2.14) by ¯ˆv+τ ¯ˆw we get, respectively,

(ˆv + τ ˆw)t(¯ˆu + τ ¯ˆv) = (−|ξ|2 ˆu − β|ξ|2ˆv)(¯ˆu + τ ¯ˆv)

= (−|ξ|2 ˆu − β|ξ|2ˆv − τ|ξ|2ˆv + τ|ξ|2ˆv)(¯ˆu + τ ¯ˆv)

and

(ˆu + τ ˆv)t(¯ˆv + τ ¯ˆw) = (τ ˆw + ˆv)(¯ˆv + τ ¯ˆw).

Summing up the above two equations and taking the real part, we obtain

F1(ξ, t) + |ξ|2|ˆu + τ ˆv|2 − |ˆv + τ ˆw|2 = |ξ|2(τ − β) Re(ˆv(¯ˆu + τ ¯ˆv)).

Next, we deﬁne the functional F2(ξ, t) as

A simple application of Gronwall’s lemma, leads to the estimate (2.6), as L and the norm of
(cid:3)
ˆV are equivalent.

In order to prove our ﬁrst main result, we also need the ﬁrst inequality of the following

lemma. The rest of it will be used to prove the decay results in the other sections.
Lemma 2.5. For all t ≥ 0 and for all j ≥ 0, c > 0, the following estimates hold:

|ξ|je−c|ξ|2tdξ ≤ C(1 + t)−N/2−j/2,

for

N ≥ 1.

|ξ|je−c|ξ|2t |cos(t|ξ|)|2 dξ ≤ C(1 + t)−N/2−j/2,

Proof. First, to prove inequality (2.25) we will ﬁrst prove that for given c > 0 and k ≥ 0, we
have

(2.29)
for all t ≥ 0, where C is a positive constant independent of t. To see this, observe ﬁrst that
for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, the estimate (2.29) is obvious. On the other hand, for t ≥ 1, we have

and dξ = |ξ|N−1dr to the left hand side of (2.25) and using (2.29), (2.25) is immediately
obtained.
Second, the estimate (2.26) is straightforward: we may just use the fact that | cos(t|ξ|)| ≤ 1

and apply (2.25).

Third, to show (2.28) we ﬁrst see that

| sin(t|ξ|)| ≤ t|ξ|

the change of variable r = |ξ| and dξ = |ξ|N−1dr, we write

We can now proceed to give and prove our ﬁrst main result, which reads as follows.

Theorem 2.6. Let u be the solution of (2.1)-(2.2). Assume that 0 < τ < β. Let V =
(τ utt + ut, ∂x(τ ut + u), ∂xut) and assume that V0 ∈ L1(RN ) ∩ H s(RN ), s ≥ 1. Then, for all
0 ≤ j ≤ s, we have
(cid:107)∂j
(2.31)

xV (t)(cid:107)L2(RN ) ≤ C(1 + t)−N/4−j/2(cid:107)V0(cid:107)L1(RN ) + e−ct(cid:107)∂j

xV0(cid:107)L2(RN ).

Proof. First, observe that the Fourier image of V satisﬁes the decay estimate of Proposition
2.1. Now, to show (2.31), we have from (2.7) that

Applying the Plancherel theorem and using the estimate in (2.6), we obtain

(2.34)
where we have used the inequality (2.25). In the high-frequency region (|ξ| ≥ 1), we have

Collecting the above two estimates, we obtain (2.31). This ﬁnishes the proof of Theorem
(cid:3)
2.6.

Remark 2.7. The estimate (2.31) does not give the decay rate of the solution u. In fact, it
gives the decay rates of the norms (cid:107)τ utt + ut(cid:107)L2, (cid:107)∂x(τ ut + u)(cid:107)L2 and (cid:107)∂xut(cid:107)L2 (and also of
the corresponding derivatives). These three norms are expected to decay with diﬀerent rates.
In order to know the decay rate of the solution and all its spatial derivatives, we need to
use the explicit form of the solution and the eigenvalues expansion. This will be done in the
following section.

3. Eigenvalues expansion

In this section, we use the eigenvalues expansion and the explicit form of the Fourier image

of the solution in order to ﬁnd the decay rates of the solution and its spacial derivatives.

The characteritic equation associated to (2.4) is

(3.1)

det(L + |ξ|2A − λI) = τ λ3 + λ2 + β|ξ|2λ + |ξ|2 = 0.

The solutions λi, i = 1, 2, 3 of the previous equation are the eigenvalues of Φ(ξ). We will
use either λi(ξ) or λi(|ξ|) to denote them (depending on which of both notations is more
convenient and when no confusion is possible) during the text below.

The following proposition on the description of these eigenvalues is an adaptation of some
of the results of Proposition 4 of [20] (some part also in [17]), that we summarize and adapt
here for a better comprehension and to be used later in the present work.
Proposition 3.1 (Description of the eigenvalues, [20] and [17]). For each ξ ∈ RN there exist
three corresponding eigenvalues of Φ(ξ), that we name λj(|ξ|), j = 1, 2, 3, the three solutions
of the corresponding characteristic equation (3.1).

We deﬁne the following numbers m1, m2, which are the zeroes of the Cardano discriminant

associated to the characteristic equation (3.1):

Under the dissipativeness condition 0 < τ < β, the eigenvalues of Φ(ξ) satisfy the following:

Remark 3.2. Observe that with the previous labelling of the eigenvalues in part 1 of Propo-
sition 3.1, each λi(|ξ|), i = 1, 2, 3, is a continuous function in ξ. However, during the rest of
the paper and for simplicity in the notation we may call λ1 the real eigenvalue and λ2,3 the
complex conjugate ones for all ξ in some proofs (it will be mentioned when this is done).

MOORE-GIBSON-THOMPSON EQUATION IN RN

In the description of the eigenvalues, we also need to prove the following lemma.

Lemma 3.3. The characteristic equation associated to (2.1) has no pure imaginary solution
if 0 < τ < β (dissipative case).

−τ α3 + β|ξ|2α = 0

Proof. We consider (3.1), the characteristic equation associated to (2.1). Assume that there
exists an eigenvalue λ0(|ξ|) = iα as a solution of (3.1) with α ∈ R. Plugging λ0 into (3.1)
and splitting the real and imaginary parts, we obtain

From the ﬁrst equation, we have two possibilites: α = 0 or α = ±(cid:113) β

τ |ξ|. In the ﬁrst case
and using now the second equation, the only possibility is that α = |ξ| = 0, which actually
means that λ0 = 0 is a (double) real eigenvalue when |ξ| = 0. The second one would be
fulﬁlled only if |ξ| = 0 or if β = τ . If |ξ| = 0, we would again obtain λ0 = 0 as a (double)
real eigenvalue. The case β = τ will not be considered since we assumed that 0 < τ < β.
Hence, the characteristic equation associated to (2.1) has no pure imaginary solutions in the
dissipative case.
(cid:3)

|ξ|2 − α2 = 0.

and

In order to give the decay rate of the solution in the next section, we now proceed to
give asymptotic approximations of the eigenvalues of Φ(ξ) when |ξ| → 0 and |ξ| → ∞. For
this purpose, it will be more convenient to apply the change of variables ζ = i|ξ| in the
characteristic equation (3.1), that now becomes:

(3.6)

det(L − ζ 2A − λI) = τ λ3 + λ2 − βζ 2λ − ζ 2 = 0.

Recall that λj(ζ), j = 1, 2, 3, are the roots of (3.6), that we write

(3.7)

or, equivalently,

λj(ζ) = λ(0)

j + λ(1)

j ζ + λ(2)

j ζ 2 + ...,

j = 1, 2, 3.

λj(|ξ|) = λ(0)

j + λ(1)

j

i|ξ| − λ(2)

j

|ξ|2 + ...,

j = 1, 2, 3.

For simplicity, we will denote now as λ1 the real root and λ2,3 the complex conjugate ones
when |ξ| → 0, both when 0 < τ /β < 1/9 and 1/9 < τ /β < 1 (see Remark 3.2 and Proposition
3.1).

We can now compute the ﬁrst coeﬃcients in (3.7) using the characteristic equation (3.6),

obtaining that

Under the assumption 0 < τ < β, it is clear that Re(λj) < 0 for all j = 1, 2, 3 when |ξ| → 0.

16

M. PELLICER1 AND B. SAID-HOUARI2

Remark 3.4. The behavior of the solution of (2.4) depends on the behavior of the function
eRe λj (ξ)t, j = 1, 2, 3. Since in most cases λj(|ξ|) is a power series of |ξ|, so it is its real part.
Observe that as Re λj(|ξ|) < 0, the frequencies that give the dominant part of all eRe λj (|ξ|)t
are those corresponding to small frequencies |ξ|. For this reason, the behavior of the real part
near |ξ| = 0 determines the decay rate of the solution. For large frequencies, and again as
Re λj(|ξ|) < 0, it is clear that eRe λj (|ξ|)t can be always estimated by e−ct if the powers in the
Taylor series expansion of Re λj(|ξ|) near inﬁnity are positive or by |ξ|me−c|ξ|−ˆct for a certain
m > 0 if one of the powers in the Taylor series expansion is negative. In both cases and using
Plancherel’s theorem, we see that the integral in the high frequencies is bounded if and only
if some derivatives of the solution are bounded, which means that the solution should be in
some Sobolev spaces and this gives the regularity of initial data needed for the desired decay
rate.

Next, we proceed to give asymptotic approximations of the eigenvalues when |ζ| → ∞.
Following [8], we can take η = ζ−1 = (i|ξ|)−1 and write the equation (2.4), with L and A
deﬁned in (2.5), as

ˆUt(η, t) = η−2(cid:0)Lη2 − A(cid:1) ˆU (η, t),

whose characteristic equation writes as

(3.10)

det(Lη2 − A − µI) = τ µ3 + η2µ2 − βη2µ − η4 = 0.

Observe that we have the relation

λj(ζ) = ζ 2µj(ζ−1)

between µj(η) and λj(ζ), solutions of (3.6) and (3.10) respectively.

Now, for η → 0 we can write µj(η) as:

(3.11)

Or, equivalently,

µj(η) = µ(0)

j + µ(1)

j η + µ(2)

j η2 + ...,

λj(|ξ|) = −µ(0)

where we are denoting as λ1 the real root and λ2,3 the complex conjugate ones when |ξ| → ∞
(see Proposition 3.1). Under the assumption 0 < τ < β, it is clear that Re(λj) < 0 for all
j = 1, 2, 3 when |ξ| → ∞.

Let us now divide the frequency space into three regions:

low frequency, high frequency

and middle frequency region, that is

ΥL =(cid:8)ξ ∈ RN ;|ξ| < ν1 (cid:28) 1(cid:9) , ΥH =(cid:8)ξ ∈ RN ;|ξ| > ν2 (cid:29) 1(cid:9) , ΥM =(cid:8)ξ ∈ RN ; ν1 ≤ |ξ| ≤ ν2

(cid:9) .

The choice of ν1 and ν2 will be discussed in the proofs of Proposition 3.5 and of Lemma
3.8. For the moment, we need ν1 and ν2 suﬃciently small and large, respectively, such that
the asymptotic expansions of Propositions 3.5 and 3.7 hold.

We write the solution of the system (2.1) in the above three regions.

In the following
Propositions 3.5, 3.7 and 3.9 we give bounds of the solution on each of this three regions
using the previous asymptotic expansions of the eigenvalues. These bounds will be used in
Theorem 4.1 to proof the decay estimate of the solution of problem (1.17).
Proposition 3.5. If 0 < τ < β, the solution ˆU (ξ, t) of (2.4) satisﬁes, for all ξ ∈ ΥL with
|ξ| (cid:54)= 0, the estimates:

Remark 3.6. Observe that the estimate (3.13) is not satisﬁed if |ξ| = 0 but, as it is a set of
measure zero, it will not aﬀect the decay of the solution in Theorem 4.1.
Proof. According to part 1 of Proposition 3.1, if ξ ∈ ΥL is such that |ξ| is small enough (that
is, |ξ| < ν1 <
m1) we know that there exist one real root and two complex conjugate ones.
For simplicity, we are going to denote λ1 the real root and λ2,3 the complex conjugate ones
when |ξ| → 0, both when 0 < τ /β < 1/9 and 1/9 < τ /β < 1 (see Remark 3.2 and Proposition
3.1). Hence, the solution of the equation (2.1) when ξ ∈ ΥL can be written in terms of the
corresponding eigenvalues as

In a similar way as in Proposition 3.5, we deduce that (3.20) holds.

Lemma 3.8. There is a constant c4 > 0, such that, for all ξ ∈ ΥM ,

(3.23)

Re(λj(ξ)) < −c4 < 0,

where λj(ξ), j = 1, 2, 3 are the eigenvalues of the matrix Φ(ξ).

Proof. Let us recall that ΥM =(cid:8)ξ ∈ RN ; ν1 ≤ |ξ| ≤ ν2

(cid:9) and that we have chosen ν1 and ν2

√
suﬃciently small and large, respectively, such that the asymptotic expansions of Propositions
3.5 and 3.7 hold. That is, we have chosen ν1 and ν2 such that 0 < ν1 <
m2,
where m1, m2 are the constants deﬁned in (3.2) and (3.3). Let us call ξν1 and ξν2 those ξ such
that |ξν1| = ν1 and |ξν2| = ν2, respectively.
λ1(ξ) ∈ R and λ2,3(ξ) ∈ C \ R for all |ξ| > 0 (in particular, for all ξ ∈ ΥM ) and fulﬁll

Remark 3.10. Observe that the estimates (3.26) and (3.27) are satisﬁed in a set of measure
zero, so they will not aﬀect the decay of the solution in Theorem 4.1.
Proof. First, and according to Proposition 3.1, it is clear that for all ξ ∈ ΥM , the characteristic
equation (3.1) has three roots satisfying one of the following cases:
• one real and two complex conjugate roots (see the cases in Proposition 3.1);
• three distinct real roots (see the cases in Proposition 3.1);
• there is one real root and another real root of double multiplicity (if |ξ| = 0, or τ

In the following, we discuss the above four cases.

First, suppose (3.1) has one real root and two complex conjugate ones, that, for simplicity
of notation, we will call λ1(ξ) and λ2,3(ξ) respectively (see Remark 3.2). Then the solution is
written as in (3.16):

ˆu(ξ, t) = C1(ξ)eλ1(ξ)t + eRe(λ2(ξ))t [C2(ξ) cos(Im(λ2(ξ))t) + C3(ξ) sin(Im(λ2(ξ))t)]

(3.28)
with C1, C2 and C3 satisfying (3.17). It is clear that Ci(ξ) (that is, Ci(|ξ|)), i = 1, 2, 3, are
bounded in the compact set ΥM . Thus, there exists a constant C > 0 depending on the
bounding constant and ν1 and ν2 such that
(3.29)

|Ci(ξ)| ≤ C(|ˆu0(ξ)| + |ˆu1(ξ)| + |ˆu2(ξ)|),

for all ξ ∈ ΥM

(i = 1, 2, 3).

This last inequality together with (3.23) and (3.28) leads to (3.25).

Second, if the roots of (3.1) are real and distinct, then the solution of (2.1) is written as

(3.30)

ˆu(ξ, t) = C1(ξ)eλ1(ξ)t + C2(ξ)eλ2(ξ)t + C3(ξ)eλ3(ξ)t,

where C1, C2 and C3 are satisfying the system

(3.31)

 C1 + C2 + C3 = ˆu0,

λ1C1 + λ2C2 + λ3C3 = ˆu1,
λ2
1C1 + λ2
3C3 = ˆu2

2C2 + λ2

(that this system was obtained imposing that ˆu(ξ, t) must satisfy the initial conditions (2.2)).
It is not hard to see that (3.29) also holds and therefore (as before) (3.25) is also satisﬁed.
Third, we assume that there exists ξ0 ∈ ΥM such equation (3.1) has three real roots, one
of them with double multiplicity, λ2(ξ0) = λ3(ξ0) (according to Proposition 3.1 that is when
|ξ0| = 0, or τ /β (cid:54)= 1/9 and |ξ0| =
m2). In this case, the solution of (2.1) is given
by

m1 or

√

√

(3.32)

ˆu(ξ0, t) = C1(ξ0)eλ1(ξ0)t + (C2(ξ0) + C3(ξ0)t) eλ2(ξ0)t,

22

M. PELLICER1 AND B. SAID-HOUARI2

where C1, C2 and C3 are the solutions of the system (again obtained imposing the corre-
sponding initial conditions of ˆu(ξ0, t)):

 C1 + C2 = ˆu0,

λ1C1 + λ2C2 + C3 = ˆu1,

1C1 + λ2

2C2 + 2λ2C3 = ˆu2.

(3.33)

(3.34)

(3.35)

The same estimates as in (3.29) hold. Consequently, we obtain

|ˆu(ξ0, t)| ≤ CM (1 + t) (|ˆu0(ξ0)| + |ˆu1(ξ0)| + |ˆu2(ξ0)|) e−c4t.

Finally, suppose that we are in the special case of ξ0 ∈ ΥM such that equation (3.1) has
√
a triple real root λ1,2,3(ξ0) = λ(ξ0). According to Proposition 3.1 this would happen when
τ /β = 1/9 and |ξ0| =
In this case, the
solution of (2.1) is given by

initial conditions of ˆu(ξ0, t):

4. Decay estimates

In this section, we show the decay estimates for the solution u(x, t) of the system (1.17)-
(1.18) using the eigenvalues expansion results of Section 3. For simplicity in the notation, all
the norms of this section will be in RN , although we are going to skip this in the notation.
Theorem 4.1 (L1–initial data). Let (u0, u1, u2) ∈ L1(RN ) ∩ H s(RN ), s ≥ 1, and 0 < τ < β.
Then for any t ≥ 0 the following decay estimates hold for all 0 ≤ j ≤ s and certain constants
C, c > 0 independent of t and of the initial data:

xu (t)(cid:13)(cid:13)L2 ≤ C((cid:107)u0(cid:107)L1 + (cid:107)u1(cid:107)L1 + (cid:107)u2(cid:107)L1)(1 + t)1−N/4−j/2

Remark 4.3. It is clear that for N = 3, the estimate (4.2) improves the one in (4.1). Indeed,
from (4.1), we deduce in this case that the L2-norm of the solution does not decay if j = 0.
On the other hand and from (4.2) we deduce that, for N = 3, the L2-norm of the solution
decays with the rate (1 + t)−1/4. Also, for N = 1 and j ≥ 2 or N = 2 and j ≥ 1, the estimate
(4.2) gives faster decay rate than (4.1).

Proof of Theorem 4.1. Applying the Plancherel theorem, we obtain

This gives, by using the estimate (cid:107)ˆui(cid:107)L∞(RN ) ≤ (cid:107)ui(cid:107)L1(RN ), i = 0, 1, 2, and the bound in

(2.25),

L1(1 + t)−j−2−N/2 + C(cid:107)u2(cid:107)2

L1(1 + t)−j−N/2

For L2 and recalling that 0 < τ < β (dissipative case), by using the estimate (2.26) and with
the same method as before we have
L2 ≤ C((cid:107)u0(cid:107)2

L1)(1 + t)−j−N/2.

L1 + (cid:107)u2(cid:107)2

L1 + (cid:107)u1(cid:107)2

For the term L3 and using (2.27), we have that

L1 + (cid:107)u1(cid:107)2

Collecting the above estimates, we obtain

Finally, in ΥM , we have, by exploiting (3.25),

Consequently, (4.5), (4.6) (together with the Sobolev embedding) and (4.7), then the esti-

mate (4.2) and (4.1) hold with c = min{c3, c4}, hence,

Observe that, as we had already pointed out in the previous Remarks 3.6 and 3.10, the values
of ξ where we have double or triple real roots are sets of measure zero and, hence, they do
(cid:3)
not aﬀect the decay of the solution.

Proof of Theorem 4.2. The proof is exactly the same as the one of Theorem 4.1, except for
the estimate of L3 in (4.4). To estimate L3 we have, by using (2.28) and 0 < τ < β that, for
N + j ≥ 3,

L3 ≤ C(cid:107)u0(cid:107)2
≤ C((cid:107)u0(cid:107)2

L1(1 + t)−N/2−j−1 + C(cid:107)u1(cid:107)2

L1(1 + t)−(N−2)/2−j + C(cid:107)u2(cid:107)2

L1(1 + t)−(N−2)/2−j

Collecting the above estimate with the estimates of L1 and L2 in the proof of Theorem 4.1,
we obtain

|ξ|2j|ˆu (ξ, t)|2dξ ≤ C((cid:107)u0(cid:107)2

L1 +(cid:107)u1(cid:107)2

As we have said, the estimates in ΥM and ΥH remain the same as in the proof of Theorem
(cid:3)
4.1.
Theorem 4.4 (L1,1–initial data). Let s ≥ 1, τ < β and let u0 ∈ L1(RN )∩ H s(RN ), (u1, u2) ∈
RN ui(x)dx = 0, i = 1, 2. Then, for 0 ≤ j ≤ s, the following decay

Proof. The proof is the same as the one of Theorem 4.1, except the part of the low frequency
region. So, for ξ ∈ ΥL, we have by making use of (3.14) that

where we have used that as ξ ∈ ΥL we have e−2c1t ≤ e−2c1|ξ|2t, that the sinus and cosinus

the other estimates obtained in the proof of Theorem 4.1 for the high and middle frequency
regions and, proceeding in the same way as in the proof of Theorem 4.1, then (4.9) is fulﬁlled.
