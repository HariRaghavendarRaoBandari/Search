Novel ground states might be realized in honeycomb lattices with strong spin–orbit coupling. Here
we study the electronic structure of α-RuCl3, in which the Ru ions are in a d 5 conﬁguration and form
a honeycomb lattice, by angle-resolved photoemission, x-ray photoemission and electron energy loss
spectroscopy supported by density functional theory and multiplet calculations. We ﬁnd that α-
RuCl3 is a Mott insulator with signiﬁcant spin-orbit coupling, whose low energy electronic structure
is naturally mapped onto J ef f states. This makes α-RuCl3 a promising candidate for the realization
of Kitaev physics. Relevant electronic parameters such as the Hubbard energy U, the crystal ﬁeld
splitting 10Dq and the charge transfer energy ∆ are evaluated. Furthermore, we observe signiﬁcant
Cl photodesorption with time, which must be taken into account when interpreting photoemission
and other surface sensitive experiments.

The search for novel electronic and magnetic ground-
states has ever been a driving force of condensed matter
physics. The eﬀects of strong spin-orbit coupling, pos-
sibly competing with other energy scales, have turned
out to be especially fruitful in this respect in recent
years. This is most prominently manifested by the ad-
vent of topological insulators [1]. More recently, the Ki-
taev model was established, which describes the bond-
dependent spin interactions on a honeycomb spin 1/2
lattice [2]. The Kitaev model attracts enormous atten-
tion because it is exactly solvable and its ground state is
an exotic quantum spin liquid. However, unambiguous
experimental evidence is lacking so far. The prime can-
didates for the realization of Kitaev physics have been
the 5d 5 iridates A2IrO3 (A = Na, Li) [3–7]. This thread
of research relies on the realization of eﬀective Jef f =
1/2 pseudospins by the combined interaction of spin-orbit
coupling and crystal ﬁeld splitting. But the concept of
Jef f = 1/2 pseudospins is under debate for the iridates
due to substantial lattice distortions lifting the t 2g de-
generacy, which, strictly speaking, invalidates the Jef f
description.

α-RuCl3 appeared recently against this background as
a 4d analogue to the iridates [8, 9]. Ru is in a 3+ state
and features a d 5 electron count with a low spin state.
Its spin-orbit coupling (λ ≈ 0.1 eV) is strongly reduced
as compared to the iridates, but so is its bandwidth W
due to presumed correlation eﬀects. Importantly, the lo-
cal cubic symmetry is almost perfect in contrast to the
iridates. Hence, the Jef f description might be still oper-
able for α-RuCl3. Another practical advantage is that it
can be synthesized as large, easy-to-cleave single crystals,
which oﬀer the possibility of exfoliation.

RuCl3 has been known for a long time and is even

of some importance as a chemical [10].

structure has been repeatedly investigated over the years
by optical spectroscopy and photoemission [11–13]. The
picture of a Mott-insulating state was proposed where
the Ru 4d bands are situated close to E F but show little
dispersion [13]. More recent optical data conﬁrmed the
magnitude of the charge gap E G ≈ 1.1 eV, which is much
smaller than the charge transfer energy ∆ ≈ 5 eV as
expected for a Mott insulator [14]. U has been estimated
to be about 1.5 eV [8, 13], a value often used as an input
parameter for bandstructure calculations.

As for the magnetic properties, one or two (depending
on the study) phase transitions at T ≈ 7 K and 15 K
are reported [15–17]. A strong magnetic anisotropy is
found with large eﬀective moments exceeding the S = 1/2
limit and implying a large orbital contribution. Neutron
scattering below T = 7 K is consistent with a zigzag type
order, one of the types of magnetic order predicted within
the framework of the Kitaev - Heisenberg model [9, 17].

Having mentioned some of the favorable properties of
α-RuCl3 above, a disadvantage of the material might be
its sensitivity to environment and treatment, which may
contribute to a certain scatter of reported physical prop-
erties. The crystal structure is susceptible to stacking
faults [17] and other defects. We will show that another
point must be added here, namely substantial Cl pho-
todesorption at the surface.

Nevertheless, carefully taking into account this compli-
cation, we could elucidate the electronic structure of α-
RuCl3 by state of the art photoemission (PES), electron-
energy-loss
spectroscopy (EELS), density-functional-
theory (DFT) and multiplet calculations. We achieve
a consistent, quantitative picture of a spin-orbit assisted
Mott-insulator. The central question of this study, and
decisive for the prospects of α-RuCl3 as a possible car-
rier of Kitaev groundstates, is whether or not the Jef f =

1/2 description of the electronic structure is appropriate.
Based on the comparison of the DFT calculations with
results from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES), we can answer this question aﬃrmatively.

Platelet-like single crystals up to several mm in diam-
eter of α-RuCl3 were grown by chemical vapor transport
reactions. PES measurements were performed using a
laboratory based system at room temperature after cleav-
ing the crystals in situ. The EELS (Electron Energy Loss
Spectroscopy) measurements in transmission have been
conducted using thin ﬁlms (d ≈ 100 – 200 nm) at T = 20
K. The density functional calculations were performed
using the all-electron full-potential local-orbital (FPLO)
code [18, 19] within Perdew-Wang parametrization [20].

See the supplemental material for details.
Under a cubic crystal ﬁeld, the 4d electron manifold
of Ru splits into t2g and eg states separated by the
crystal ﬁeld splitting parameter 10Dq. Fig. 1a shows
schematically the t2g states. This band cuts the Fermi en-
ergy (EF ), because in a low-spin conﬁguration with 5 d -
electrons it is not completely ﬁlled. Introducing the spin-
orbit coupling, the Jef f = 1/2 and 3/2 states separate
from each other (Fig. 1b). The on-site correlation energy
U causes a gap opening within the Jef f = 1/2 band.
Fig. 1d shows the density of states (DOS) of α-RuCl3
obtained by DFT calculated by taking into account SOC
and the correlation energy (U = 2 eV, JH = 0.4 eV, Uef f
= 1.6 eV) projected onto Jef f = 1/2 and 3/2. The DOS
correctly reproduces the gap opening and the insulating
nature of α-RuCl3. Comparing it to the general Jef f pic-
ture, it bears out the almost pure Jef f = 1/2 character of
the sharp upper Hubbard band (UHB). The lower Hub-
bard band (LHB), on the other hand, is strongly mixed
with the Jef f = 3/2 states. This is a consequence of
the antiferromagnetic order imposed on this calculation,
which gives the lowest total energy. The Jef f description
appears to be well justiﬁed by the DFT. In the following

culation.

we compare the DFT to a variety of experimental probes.
Fig. 2 shows angle-integrated photoemission spectra of
the valence band region taken with three diﬀerent pho-
ton energies. The spectra consist of three main features,
labeled 1 - 3. Their relative intensity varies as a function
of photon energy. Peaks 1 and 2 display an intensity min-
imum relative to peak 3 for hν = 40.8 eV. This reﬂects
the diﬀerent orbital character of the underlying states,
which causes a diﬀerent dependence of the photoioniza-
tion cross section on photon energy. By comparison with
tabulated values peak 1 and 2 can be assigned to Cl 3p
and peak 3 to Ru 4d states [21] in agreement with previ-
ous results [12]. However, an important diﬀerence to the
earlier studies is that we observe a larger gap. The onset
of the valence band is located at EV BO ≈ 1 eV. Together
with E G ≈ 1.2 eV (see Fig. 3) this places the Fermi level
close to the bottom of the d 6 conduction band. The full
width half maximum of the Ru 4d peak (without the
shoulder at E = - 2.7 eV) is W4d = 0.75 eV only, which
indicates that the system is susceptible to correlation ef-
fects even for moderate values of U.

The lower part of Fig. 2 presents the Ru 4d and Cl 3p
orbital projected DOS. It is identical to the DOS in Fig.
1d but has been renormalized for better comparison with
experiment (stretching factor 1.5, oﬀset 1.1 eV). The low
energy region is dominated by the Ru 4d weight while
at higher energies Cl 3p dominates in agreement with
experiment. Also the main features of the valence band
(1 - 3) are well reproduced up to ﬁner structures e.g. the
E = - 2.7 eV shoulder.

band along a cut in k - space highlighted in Fig. 3d.
The renormalized theoretical bandstructure is overlayed
over the experimental data. Two regimes can be distin-
guished: the low-energy region of weakly dispersing Ru
4d states and at higher energies more strongly dispers-
ing Cl 3p derived bands, which are clearly separated from
each other. The calculation is again in qualitative agree-
ment to the data. The low-energy region is expanded
in Fig. 3b along the same cut. The Ru 4d bands dis-
perse on the order of 200 meV. They form a minimum
around Γ and maxima around M and K. Note, that this
is not the dispersion of a single band but a superposi-
tion of many d - bands forming a broad peak. In order
to compare it to theory, we present the unrenormalized,
but oﬀset low-energy bandstructure in Fig. 3c. The to-
tal bandwidth and the principal shape of the dispersion
agree with experiment.

The horizontal red box corresponds to the energy po-
sition and integration window of the kx - ky map pre-
sented in Fig. 3d. The contour of highest intensity fol-
lows the border of the surface Brillouin zone (SBZ) shown
schematically in Fig. 3e. Fig. 3e shows a low-energy elec-
tron diﬀraction (LEED) image of a sample surface after
ﬁnishing the photoemission measurements.
It exhibits
sharp spots with the expected symmetry.

The photoemission experiments presented so far probe
the occupied states only. The charge gap is not acces-
sible in this way. We have, therefore, performed EELS

experiments and measured the loss function, which can
be expressed as Im(-1/) where  is the dielectric function
(see Fig. 4). The loss function shows several features in
the low energy region. We assign peak A at E G = 1.2 eV
to interband transitions across the charge gap, i.e. d 5d 5
→ d 4d 6.
Its energy reﬂects U reduced by half of the
bandwidth of upper and lower Hubbard band. From E G
= 1.2 eV and W4d = 0.75 eV, U = 1.6 eV is a reasonable
estimate. Here, we have assumed the width of the UHB
to be small. This is justiﬁed by the narrow line width of
the A - feature and also by the DFT, which predicts a
very narrow line (see Fig. 1d). In fact, the A feature is
narrower than W4d, which implies that excitonic eﬀects
contribute to the gap excitation.

Excitation B centered at E = 2.1 eV can be associated
with the cubic crystal ﬁeld splitting, i.e. excitations into
the e g states and is approximately 10Dq. This claim will
be substantiated further when discussing the core levels
(Fig. 5). Features C and D are both due to Cl 3p - Ru
4d charge transfer excitations. The onset of C is ≈ 3
eV which corresponds to the onset of peak 2 in Fig. 1.
The energy scales of photoemission and energy loss agree
roughly in this case because the d 6 conduction band is
situated close to E F . The energy diﬀerence of features
C and D is equal to the separation of peaks 1 and 2 in
Fig.1 lending further support to this assignment. Both
features are broad and show ﬁne structures reﬂecting the
pronounced dispersion of the Cl 3p bands.

The lower inset of Fig.

though, they are not equivalent quantities, in particular
when 1 is large. The upper inset shows again the DOS
with an assignment of the transitions A – D.

Taking together Figs. 2 - 4, a consistent description
of the electronic structure of α-RuCl3 is obtained. This
is achieved by a theoretical framework, which itself can
be naturally mapped onto the J ef f description. This
implies that the latter is indeed meaningful for α-RuCl3.
The electronic parameters introduced so far (U, ∆,
10Dq) determine the shape of the core levels, which can
then be used to check the validity of the above arguments.
We come now to the discussion of the core levels. Fig.
5 presents the 3p spectra measured by XPS and EELS,
along with multiplet calculations using a joined set of
parameters. The spectra are split due to the 3p spin-
orbit interaction by 22 eV in a 3p3/2 and a 3p1/2 state.
A double peak structure is observed in the EELS 3p3/2
line which is absent in 3p1/2 and in XPS. In fact, this
double feature is a consequence of the spin-orbit coupling
of the d - electrons. The latter splits the d -levels into
4d 5/2 and 4d 3/2 states. According to the J selection rule,
the 4d 3/2 state can be reached by both 3p1/2 and 3p3/2,
whereas the 4d 5/2 is accessible for the 3p3/2 state only.
The double peak of the 3p3/2 EELS line indicates that
the t 2g hole is of J = 5/2 character. The energy diﬀerence
between the two components is mainly determined by the
crystal ﬁeld splitting.

For the photoemission, the transitions to t 2g or e g are
not operative and only one ionization peak is observed.
Fig. 5 conﬁrms that the spin-orbit coupling must be
taken into account when describing the d -electrons. A

FIG. 5. Ru 3p EELS and XPS. Red lines: charge-transfer
multiplet calculations (see text for details).

Even more information is hidden in Fig. 5. Closer
inspection reveals weak satellite features at the high en-
ergy side of the main peaks with an energy separation of
about 8 eV. Such structures are well known in transition
metal compounds. They originate from charge transfer
processes, where an electron from the surrounding Cl -
ligands hops to the central Ru. In order to achieve a com-
plete description and understanding of the data, we mod-
eled the spectra by charge-transfer multiplet calculations
using the CTM4XAS package [22]. Motivated by the low
energy PES and EELS results discussed above, we ﬁxed
10Dq = 2.2 eV, ∆ = 5 eV. The latter is to be considered
as an average value for the broad energy region of charge
transfer excitations seen in Fig. 4. The Slater integrals
have been reduced to 25 % of their atomic values [23]. We
set the overlap integrals T eg = 2 eV and T t2g = 1 eV and
the d -level core-hole repulsion U dc = 3 eV. The latter is
usually 1 - 2 eV larger than U. With these parameters and
appropriate Gaussian and Lorentzian broadening the red
spectra are obtained. For XPS, quantitative agreement
is accomplished. The calculation reproduces the shape of
the principal lines and position and weight of the satel-
lites. The branching ratio diﬀers slightly, probably due
to cross section and diﬀraction eﬀects. The shape of the
EELS spectrum is also correctly reproduced, in particular
the line splitting of the p3/2 peak. The satellite intensity
is underestimated by the calculation due to the presence
of a Ru 3p → Ru 5s transition [24].

Core level spectroscopy is also a means for control-
ling the sample stoichiometry. Fig. 6b shows the Cl 2p
line for varying exposure times and emission angle nor-
malized to the Ru 3p line at higher energy (not shown).

ing eﬀect. The limited surface stability of α-RuCl3 has
to be taken into account for the interpretation of pho-
toemission experiments and, possibly, surface sensitive
techniques in general.

In summary, we have investigated the electronic struc-
ture of α-RuCl3 in detail. The angle-integrated valence
band PES shows a main Ru 4d contribution at E = -
1.6 eV with a width of W 4d = 0.75 eV. The Fermi level
must be pinned close to the bottom of the conduction
band in our samples. The Cl 3p derived states are lo-
cated at higher energies and have a much larger width.
In the angle-resolved mode, it becomes clear that the Cl
3p states show also a much larger dispersion than the Ru
4d bands. The latter disperse on the order of 200 meV
only. All this is well described by DFT calculations us-
ing U ef f = 1.6 eV exhibiting a clear correspondence to
the generic J ef f description of local cubic systems with
large spin-orbit coupling. From EELS measurements the
direct gap is E g = 1.2 eV with a very sharp gap excitation
mode. The crystal ﬁeld splitting 10Dq is about 2.2 eV
and the charge transfer excitations span a broad energy
range in the loss function reﬂecting their large width in
the PES valence band. The gap value and the width of
LHB and UHB are consistent with U ef f = 1.6 eV. The
validity of the electronic parameters U ef f , 10Dq and ∆
is conﬁrmed by core level spectroscopy in combination
with multiplet-calculations. The splitting of the 3p3/2
line into two components seen in EELS but not in XPS
indicates the relevance of the SOC for the 4d -electrons.
Finally, XPS clearly shows a light induced loss of Cl at
the surface, which alters the stoichiometry with time and
substantially inﬂuences the valence band shape.

The above observations convey the picture of a Mott
insulator whose low-energy structure is dictated by a
mixture of the local cubic symmetry and spin-orbit cou-
pling which might give rise to exotic magnetic ground-
states.

energy after short and long exposition. b) Cl 2p core level. c)

The intensity decreases for long exposure and when the
emission angle increases, i.e. when the measurement be-
comes more surface sensitive. Additionally the peaks
shift slightly to higher energies with exposure time. Ob-
viously, the surface Cl content is not stable under illu-
mination and suﬀers from desorption. This has severe
consequences for the low energy electronic structure as
shown in Fig. 6a for a surface sensitive valence band
spectrum measured with hν = 21.2 eV. A low energy
shoulder develops and shifts E V BO substantially towards
E F and reduces thereby the gap. The feature is likely of
Ru 4d character because it has an identical dependence
on photon energy as the Ru 4d peak. Moreover, a slight
up-shift of the exposed spectra is seen also in the valence
band. The features become broader and lose dispersion.
The lineshape of the XPS Ru peaks is relatively stable,
only small changes appear for the most surface sensitive
measurements (see Fig. 6c). Also the XPS valence band
hardly changes. Cl photoreduction has been reported
before for RuCl3 [25]. The Cl desorption will cause dis-
order at the surface which accounts for line broadening
and loss of dispersion. It may also reduce Ru3+ to lower
oxidation states, which tends to shift spectral features
to lower energy in agreement with the low energy shoul-
der developing in the valence band. The down-shift of
the core-levels, on the other hand, could be a band ﬁll-
