Introduction

3

This thesis deals with the computation of the Jordan-H¨older decomposition
of a parabolic induced representation of GLn over a p-adic ﬁeld F . Starting
with irreducible cuspidal representations, Zelevinsky classiﬁed the irreducible
representations in terms of multisegments

a 7→ La,

where La is the irreducible representation of GLn(F ) associated to the mul-
tiset a, which is a set with multiplicities, of segments

∆ρ,r = {ρ, ρν, · · · , ρνr−1},

where ρ is an irreducible cuspidal representation of GLg(F ), n = rg and
ν : GLg(F ) → C is the character given

x 7→ | det(x)|1/2.

For example, L∆ν1−r ,r
is the trivial representation of GLr(F ). Given a multi-
segment a = {∆1, · · · , ∆s} the total parabolic associated induced represen-
tation is

π(a) = L∆1 × L∆2 × · · · × L∆s

and one wants to compute the multiplicity m(b, a) of Lb in π(a).
Zelevinsky introduced the geometry of nilpotent orbits and conjectured that
the coeﬃcients m(b, a) is the value at q = 1 of the Poincar´e series Pσ(a),σ(b)(q)
where σ(a) and σ(b) are the associated orbits. Moreover, he proved that
these orbital varieties admit an open immersion into some Schubert varieties
of type A. This conjecture was proved by Chriss-Ginzburg and Ariki, see
[10], [1].

In the ﬁrst part of this thesis, we are interested in another conjecture of
Zelevinsky stated in the last sentence of §8 of [29].

Conjecture. The m(b, a) depend only on natural relationships between seg-
ments of a and b.

Note:

• ﬁrst that using types theory, the m(b, a) are independent of the Zelevin-
sky lines considered , cf.
[26] for example, so that one is reduced to
the case where the cuspidal support of all the segment considered are
contained in the Zelevinsky line of the trivial representation.

i

• Using this reduction, this conjecture can now be viewed as a special case
of a conjecture of Lusztig about combinatorial invariance of Kazhdan-
Lusztig polynomials which can be stated in these terms: let x ≤ y two
elements of the symmetric group Sn, the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial
Px,y(q) depends only on the poset structure of [x, y] := {z ∈ Sn : x ≤
z ≤ y}.

The main application of the results of the this part of this thesis is then the
proof of the above conjecture of Zelevinsky, cf. theorem 4.4.5: the results is
already interesting in the symmetric case, cf. the corollary 4.4.7.

Our approach rests on the use of some truncation functors

and the notion of partial derivativation

a 7→ a(k),

D k indexed by integers k ∈ Z,

which allows us, starting from general multisegments a and b, to reduce to
a symmetric situation where a and b are parametrized by σ, τ ∈ Sn for some
n usually less than the degree of a. In this symmetric case we obtain, using
the result of Chriss-Ginzburg and Ariki, the equality

m(aτ , aσ) = Pτ,σ(1),

where Pτ,σ is the Kazhdan Lusztig polynomial associated to the permutations
τ, σ ∈ Sn.
Let us recall that these m(aτ , aσ) are given, using Chriss-Ginzburg and Ariki,
by Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for the symmetric group Sm where m is the
degree of a. So our formula can be also viewed as equalities between Kazhdan-
Lusztig polynomials for diﬀerent symmetric groups: these equalities where
also obtained by Henderson [13], but instead of using the Billey-Warrington
cancellation for the symmetric group, we investigate the geometry of nilpo-
tent symmetric orbits.
Remark: using our truncation method, it should be possible to ﬁnd a new
algorithm for computing the general m(b, a).

In the second part we give some applications of our method, the main aim is
to give a formula for the computation of an induced representation

La × Lb =X m(c, b, a)Lc.

in terms of the coeﬃcients of the ”highest degree term” of some explicit
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. For the moment we treat the case where b is

ii

a segment and leave the general case for future work. To give an impression,
the most simple formula in the case where b = [k + 1] from proposition 8.1.5,
looks like

La × Lb = La+b + Xc∈Γℓk −1(a,k)

(θk(c, a) − θk(c[k+1]1, a + b))Lc

[k+1]1[k]ℓk−1 .

where the θk(c, a) are deﬁned thanks to partial derivative, cf. notation 7.8.17.
It would be interesting to compare our results with the known criteria of the
irreducibility for parabolic induced representations, cf. [25], [19] and [14].
Moreover,

• in chapter 5, we obtain a geometric interpretation of the 5 relations

deﬁning Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.

• In view of the conjecture of Lusztig, which can be viewed as an general-
ization of Zelevinsky’s conjecture, in chapter 6, we give a classiﬁcation
of the posets S(a) = {b : b ≤ a}, in the sense of notation 1.3.2.
We prove that they can be identiﬁed with either an interval in the
symmetric group Sn or an interval in an double quotient of Sn, which
corresponds to parabolic orbits in a generalized ﬂag variety.

• Concerning partial derivation, in Chapter 7, using the Lusztig product
of perverse sheaves (cf. [23]), we give a geometric meaning of the mul-
tiplicities appearing in the partial derivatives. In the general case we
then obtain an explicit formula for the derivative D k(La), cf. corollary
7.8.16. The main application is to calculate the coeﬃcient m(c, b, a)
in chapter 8.

Let us now give more details. For a p-adic ﬁeld F and g > 1, an irreducible
admissible representation ρ of GLg(F ) is called cuspidal if for all proper
parabolic subgroup P , the corresponding Jacquet functor J G
P sends ρ to 0.
We write

ν : GLg(F ) → C,

ν(x) = | det(x)|1/2

and for k ≥ 1 and ρ a cuspidal irreducible representation of GLg(F ), we call
the set

∆ρ,k = {ρ, ρν, · · · , ρνk−1}

a segment. For such a segment, the normalized induction functor

indGLkg(F )

Pg,··· ,g (ρ ⊗ · · · ⊗ ρνk−1)

iii

contains an unique irreducible sub-representation denoted by L[ρ,νk−1ρ], where
Pg,··· ,g is the standard parabolic subgroup with Levi subgroup isomorphic to
k blocks of GLg. Then a multisegment is a multiset of segments that is a
set with multiplicities. For i = 1, · · · , r, let ρi be an irreducible cuspidal
representation of GLni(F ) and for ki ∈ N, by deﬁnition, the multisegment

a = {∆ρi,ki : i = 1, · · · , r},

is of degree deg(a) = X niki.

In [29], the authors gave a parametriza-
tion a 7→ La of irreducible admissible representations of GLn(F ) in terms
of multisegments of degree n, where for a well ordered multisegment a(cf.
deﬁnition 1.1.9), the representation La is the unique irreducible submodule
of the parabolic induced representation

π(a) = indGLn(F )

P

(L∆ρ1,k1

⊗ · · · ⊗ L∆ρr ,kr ).

Now given two multisegments a and b, one wants to determine the multi-
plicity m(b, a) of Lb in π(a).
Thanks to the Bernstein central decomposition, one is reduced to the case
where the cuspidal representation ρi of a and b belongs to the same Zelevin-
sky line {ρ0νk : k ∈ Z}. Zelevinsky also conjectured that m(b, a) is inde-
pendent of ρ0 and depends only on the relative position of a and b: this
conjecture now follows from the theory of types, cf. [26]. So one is reduced
to the simplest case where ρ0 is the trivial representation.

Let us now explain what is known about these coeﬃcients m(b, a) where the
cuspidal support of a, b belongs the Zelevinsky line of the trivial represen-
tation. First of all, it is proved in [29] that there exists a poset structure on
the set of multisegments such that mb,a > 0 if and only if b ≤ a. And we let

S(a) = {b : b ≤ a}.

In [30], Zelevinsky introduced the nilpotent orbit associated to a multiseg-
ment a. More precisely, to a multisegment a, one can associate ϕa : Z → N
with ϕa(k) the multiplicities of νk appearing in a. For each ϕ, Vϕ is a C-
ϕ(k) with graded k-part of dimension

ϕ(k). Then Eϕ is the set of endomorphisms T of degree +1, which admits a
GL(Vϕ,k). Then the orbits of Eϕ under

vector spaces of dimension deg ϕ :=Xk∈Z
natural action of the group Gϕ =Yk
Gϕ are parametrized by multisegments a =Xi≤j

aij∆νi,j−i+1 such that ϕ = ϕa

iv

consisting of T with aij Jordan cells starting from Vϕ,i to Vϕ,j. We note Oa
this orbit and we have the nice following property

Oa = Gb≥a

Ob.

Now given a local system La on Oa, we can consider its intermediate extension
IC(La) on Oa and its ﬁber at a geometric point zb of Ob and form the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial

Pa,b(q) =Xi

qi/2 dimC Hi(IC(La))zb.

Zelevinsky then conjectured that mb,a = Pa,b(1) and call it the p-adic ana-
logue of Kazhdan Lusztig Conjecture. This conjecture is a special case of a
more general multiplicities formula proved by Chriss and Ginzburg in [10],
chapter 8.

In this work, we ﬁrst introduce the notion of a symmetric multisegment
(cf. deﬁnition 2.1.5), which is, roughly speaking, a multisegment such that
the beginnings and the ends of its segments are distinct and its segments
admit non-empty intersections. We show that for a well chosen1 symmetric
multisegment aId, there is a natural bijection between the symmetric group
Sn to the set of symmetric multisegments S(aId), cf. proposition 2.1.8, where
n is the number of segments contained in aId.
When we restrict to the geometry of the nilpotent orbits to the symmetric
locus, we recover the geometric situation of the Schubert varieties associated
to Sn and obtain that for two symmetric multisegment aσ, aτ associated to
σ, τ ∈ Sn, the coeﬃcient maσ,aτ = Pσ,τ (1).

The next step in chapter 3 is to try to reach non symmetric cases, starting
with a symmetric one. For example for a ≥ b be two multisegments and νk
in the supercuspidal support of a, one can eliminate every νk which appears
at the end of some segments in a and b to obtain respectively a new pair of
multisegments a(k), b(k) and try to prove that that m(b, a) = m(b(k), a(k)).
This result is almost true if we demand that b belongs to some subset S(a)k
of S(a), cf. Prop.3.4.1. The proof relies on the study of the geometry of
nilpotent orbits and their links with the Grassmannian, cf. the introduction
of chapter 3.

1Thanks to corollary 4.4.7 which is a particular case of the Zelevinsky’s conjecture, the

results are independent of the choice of aId.

v

In chapter 4, we iterate the process in chapter 3. In fact, for a multisegment
a and k1, · · · , kr integers such that νki appears in the supercuspidal support
of a, let

a(k1,··· ,kr) = (((a(k1)) · · · )(kr)),

and

S(a)k1,··· ,kr = {c ∈ S(a) : c(k1,··· ,ki) ∈ S(a(k1,··· ,ki))ki+1, for i = 1, · · · , r}.

Then we show that for b ∈ S(a)k1,··· ,kr, we always have

m(b, a) = m(a(k1,··· ,kr), b(k1,··· ,kr)),

Reciprocally, we show, cf. proposition 4.2.4, that for any pair of multiseg-
ments a > b, we can ﬁnd asym and bsym < asym such that

m(b, a) = m(bsym, asym).

In the end of chapter 4, following an example, we present an algorithm to
ﬁnd (asym, bsym) . Finally the main application of the ﬁrst part of this thesis,
is, cf. theorem 4.4.5, the proof of the Zelevinsky’s conjecture stated before.

In the second part, we consider the application of our result from the ﬁrst
four chapters.
In chapter 5, as a ﬁrst application, using the relation be-
tween symmetric groups and symmetric multisegments we try to give a new
proof of the fact that the Poincar´e polynomial Paτ ,aσ(q) of the intersection
cohomology groups Hi(IC(Oaτ ))aσ for

• aσ > aτ a pair of symmetric multisegments with σ, τ ∈ Sn ,

• where the index aσ indicates that we localize at a point in Oaσ,

satisﬁes the axioms deﬁning the Kazhdan Lusztig polynomials for a Hecke
algebra.

In Chapter 6, we classify the poset S(a). First of all, we single out the case
where the multisegment a contains segments with diﬀerent beginnings and
endings and call it ordinary multisegment, cf. deﬁnition 2.1.1. In this case
we prove that, as a poset,

S(a) ≃ S(asym, asym

min) := {d ∈ S(asym) : d ≥ asym

min},

where amin is the minimal element in S(a) and asym(resp. asym
min ) is the sym-
metric multisegment associated to a (resp. amin) constructed in Chapter 4.

vi

Recall that in Chapter 2, we showed that S(asym) ⊆ S(aId), for some aId, and
S(aId) as a poset is isomorphic to Sn with n equal to the number of segments
contained in aId. In this way, we identify the poset S(a) with some Bruhat
interval in Sn, where n is the number of segments contained in a.
In the general case, as the ordinary case, we can reduce to parabolic multiseg-
ments where a multisegment a is called parabolic if all of its segments contain
a common point, cf. deﬁnition 6.2.5 and 6.2.22. Then all our construction for
symmetric multisegments can be carried out with parabolic multisegments.
Finally, we show that the poset S(a) is isomorphic to a Bruhat interval in
SJ2\Sn/SJ1, where Ji(i = 1, 2) is a subset of generators and SJi is the sub-
group generated by Ji, see proposition 6.3.6 for details.

In chapter 7, if one is interested in calculating the multiplicities in La × Lb,
it might be interesting to ﬁrst compute D k(La). Using the formula of π(a) =

Xb

m(b, a)Lb, one is reduced to compute

D k(π(a)) =Xb

n(b, a)Lb

for some coeﬃcients n(b, a) ≥ 0. As expected we can introduce a poset
structure (cid:22)k on the set of multisegments so that n(b, a) ≥ 0 ⇔ b (cid:22)k a, cf.
proposition 7.1.4. Then using the notion of Lusztig’s product of two perverse
sheaves we prove, cf. proposition 7.3.8, that n(b, a) is the value at q = 1 of
the Poincar´e series of Lusztig product of two explicit perverse sheaves. In the
parabolic case, we give an explicit description of this Lusztig product. As a
consequence, for case deg(b) < deg(a), we show that the coeﬃcient n(b, a)

(ℓ(y) − ℓ(x) − 1)
is related to some µ(x, y), which is the coeﬃcient of degree
in Px,y(q) deﬁned to be zero if ℓ(y) − ℓ(x) is even), where x, y are elements
in certain symmetric group and are related to a, b.

In the last chapter we use the computation of the partial derivatives in chap-
ter 7 to give a recursive formula for the coeﬃcients in the induced represen-
tation

La × Lb =X m(c, b, a)Lc.

It should be possible to treat the general case, but here we only consider the
case where b is a segment. The idea is to pass to lower degree by applying
the partial derivatives. The formulas are complicated, cf. proposition 8.1.12,
even in the simplest case where b is a point.
It should be interesting to
implement the algorithm on a computer.

Induced Representations of GLn

The aim of this section is to present our main object of study which are some
integral coeﬀcients introduced by Zelevinsky, and deﬁned by the formula
1.2.4, relating to some multisegments a, b with cupsidal support contained
in the Zelevinsky line associated to a cuspidal representation ρ.
Recall that the set of irreducible representations of GLn breaks into pieces
according to the super-cuspidal support (Bernstein Center), and, thanks to
the theory of types, we are reduced to study the unipotent block, cf.
[26],
that is induced representations with super-cuspidal support contained in the
Zelevinsky line attach to the representation ρ = 1.
Every unipotent irreducible representation is parametrized by a multiseg-
ment a, that can be viewed as a function from the set of segments C to N.
For a multisegment a, we denote by La the corresponding irreducible rep-
resentation and π(a) the induced representation, cf. notations 1.1.15. The
question is then to calculate the image of such an induced representation
in the associated Grothendieck group, that is to compute the multiplicity
m(b, a) of Lb in π(a).

To begin, let us ﬁx some notations. Let p be a prime number, F/Qp be a ﬁnite
extension. We ﬁx an absolute value |.| on F such that |̟F | = 1/q, where ̟F
is a uniformizer of F , and q is the order of its residue ﬁeld. For an integer
n ≥ 1, we denote by ν the character of GLn(F ) deﬁned by ν(g) = |det(g)|.

1.1 Zelevinsky Classiﬁcation

Notation 1.1.1. We denote a partition of n by n = {r1, · · · , rα} with

ri = n. For a divisor m of n, the partition (m, · · · , m) will be denoted

αXi=1

nm. We will also use the notation n + m = (n, m).

3

Deﬁnition 1.1.2. For a partition n, let

Pn = Pn(F ) = MnUn

be the corresponding parabolic subgroup of GLn(F ) with its decomposition
into the product of its Levi subgroup Mn = GLr1(F ) × · · · GLrα(F ) and its
unipotent radical Un. Let δPn be the modular character of Pn, given by

δPn(−) = |det(ad(−)|Lie Un)|−1

For a topological group G, we recall that a representation (π, V ) of G is

• smooth if for any vectors v, the stabilizer of v in G is an open subgroup,

• admissible if for any open compact subgroup K of G, V K = {v : k.v =

v, ∀k ∈ K} is of ﬁnite dimension.

According to [4] theorem 4.1, a smooth representation of GLn(F ) is of ﬁnite
length if and only if it is admissible and ﬁnitely generated.

Deﬁnition 1.1.3. For n = {r1, · · · , rα} and ρ = ρ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ρrα a smooth
representation of Mn, where the ρi are representations of GLri(F ), trivially
extended to Pn, we deﬁne the normalized induction functor which associates
to ρ the representation π = indGLn(F )

(ρ) of G such that

Pn

π =(cid:26)f : G → V |

f (pg) = δPn(p)−1/2ρ(p)f (g), ∀p ∈ Pn, f (gk) = f (g)

for all k ∈ K, with K a certain open subgroup. (cid:27) ,

here G acts on f by π(g)f (x) = f (xg).

Deﬁnition 1.1.4. Let (π, V ) be a representation of GLn(F ) and Pn a parabolic
subgroup. Let J GLn(F )

(π) be the Jacquet functor of π deﬁned by

Pn

J GLn(F )
Pn

(π) = V /V (Un),

where V (Un) = {u.v − u|u ∈ Un, v ∈ V }.

Remark: Both parabolic induction and Jacquet functor are additive exact
functors between the category of smooth representations of Mn and GLn(F ).
Moreover, they preserve admissible representations and ﬁnitely generated
representations.

Proposition 1.1.5. (cf.
[27] theorem 2.7, 4.1 and 5.3.) For π a smooth
representation of GLn(F ), and σ a smooth representation of Mn, we have
the following Frobenius reciprocity,

HomG(π, indGLn(F )

Pn

(σ)) = HomMn(J GLn(F )

Pn

(π), σδ−1/2

Pn

).

4

Deﬁnition 1.1.6. A smooth representation of GLn(F ) is called cuspidal if
for all nontrivial parabolic subgroup Pn of GLn(F ),

J GLn(F )
Pn

(π) = 0.

We denote by Cn the set of irreducible cuspidal representations of GLn(F ),
and

C =an≥1

Cn.

[5] 4.1) Let π be an irreducible representation of
Proposition 1.1.7. (cf.
GLn(F ), then there exists a partition n = {r1, · · · , rα} and a cuspidal rep-
resentation ρ = ρ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ρα, of Mn, such that π can be embedded into
indGLn(F )
(ρ). The set {ρ1, · · · , ρr} is determined by π up to permutation, we
call it the cuspidal support of π.

Pn

According to Harish Chandra, the study of irreducible representations of GLn
is thus divided into two parts, the cuspidal representations and the parabol-
ically induced representations. We will not discuss here the classiﬁcation of
cuspidal representations of GLn(F ), which rests on the theory of types for
which the reader can refer to for example [8].

Deﬁnition 1.1.8. By a multiset, we mean a pair (S, r) where S is a set and
r : S → N is a map. We say (S1, r1) ⊆ (S2, r2) if S1 ⊆ S2 and r1(s) ≤ r2(s)
for all s ∈ S1. We deﬁne a bijection of multisets from (S1, r1) to (S2, r2) to
be a bijection ξ : S1 → S2 satisfying

r2(ξ(x)) = r1(x).

Convention: Naturally, we write a multiset as a set with repetition. For
example, for S = {a, b} and r(a) = 2, r(b) = 1, then we write the multiset
(S, r) by {a, a, b}.

Deﬁnitions 1.1.9.

• By a segment, we mean a subset ∆ of C of the
form ∆ = {ρ, νρ, · · · , νρk = ρ′}. We denote it by ∆ = [ρ, ρ′] where
b(∆) := ρ is called its beginning and e(∆) := ρ′ its end. Let Σuniv be
the set of segments.

• We say that two segments ∆1 and ∆2 are linked if none of them is

contained in the other and the union is again a segment.

• For ∆1 = [ρ1, ρ′

1] and ∆2 = [ρ2, ρ′
linked and ρ2 = νkρ1 with k > 0.

2], we say ∆1 proceeds ∆2 if they are

5

• By a multisegment, we mean a ﬁnite multiset a = {∆1, · · · , ∆r}. Let

Ouniv be the set of multisegments.

• We say a multisegment a = {∆1, · · · , ∆r} is well ordered if for each

pair of indices i, j such that i < j, ∆i does not proceeds ∆j.

Remark: for a given multisegment, we may have several ways to arrange it
to be a well ordered multisegment.

Notation 1.1.10. Let a = {∆1, · · · , ∆r}. We call

e(a) =(cid:8)e(∆1), · · · , e(∆r)(cid:9)

respectively the end and the beginning of a as a multiset.

and

b(a) =(cid:8)b(∆1), · · · , b(∆r)(cid:9)

Deﬁnition-Proposition 1.1.11. ([29]3.1) Let ρ be a cuspidal representa-
tion of GLm(F ) then for n = rm

indGLrm(F )

Pnm

(ρ ⊗ νρ ⊗ · · · ⊗ νr−1ρ)

contains a unique irreducible sub-representation, denoted by L[ρ,νm−1ρ].

Notation 1.1.12. Let n = (r1, · · · , rα) be a partition. Let πi be a represen-
tation of GLri(F ) for i = 1, · · · , α. Then we denote

π1 × · · · × πα = indGLn(F )

Pn

(π1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ πα).

Proposition 1.1.13. ([29] Theorem 4.2) Let ∆1, · · · , ∆r be segments, then
the following two conditions are equivalent:

(1) The representation L∆1 × · · · × L∆r is irreducible.

(2) For each 1 ≤ i, j ≤ r, ∆i and ∆j are not linked.

The following theorem gives a complete classiﬁcation of the induced irre-
ducible representations of GLn(F ) in terms of multisegments.

Theorem 1.1.14. Let a = {∆1, · · · , ∆r} be a well ordered multisegment.

(1) Then the representation

L∆1 × · · · × L∆r

contains an unique sub-representation, which we denote by La.

6

(2) The representations La and La′ are isomorphic if and only if a = a′ as
well ordered multisegments, which means that there is a way to well
order a′ to obtain a.

(3) Any irreducible representation of GLn(F ) is isomorphic to some repre-

sentation of the form La.

Remark: according to (2), the irreducible representation La does not depend
on the well ordered form of a.

Notation 1.1.15. From now on, for a = {∆1, · · · , ∆r} being well ordered,
we denote

π(a) = L∆1 × · · · × L∆r .

1.2 Coeﬃcients m(b, a)

Notation 1.2.1. We denote by Rn the Grothendieck group of the category
of ﬁnite length representations of GLn(F ) and

Runiv = ⊕n≥1Rn.

Proposition 1.2.2. The set Runiv is a bi-algebra with the multiplication µ
and co-multiplication c given by

µ(π1 ⊗ π2) = π1 × π2,

c(π) =

nXr=0

J GLn(F )
Pr,n−r (π).

A consequence of theorem 1.1.14 is:

Corollary 1.2.3. The algebra Runiv is a polynomial ring with indeterminates
{L∆ : ∆ ∈ Σuniv}. Moreover, as a Z-module, the set {La : a ∈ Ouniv} form
a basis for Runiv.

Remark: Note that this implies the Bernstein Center theorem, i.e, we have a
decomposition

Runiv =Yρ

R(ρ),

where ρ runs through the equivalent classes of irreducible supercuspidal rep-
resentations, here we say two irreducible supercuspidal representations are
equivalent if they lie in the same Zelevinsky line, and R(ρ) is the subalgebra
with support contained in the Zelevinsky line Πρ generate by ρ.

7

Using theorem 1.1.14, let a = {∆1, · · · , ∆r} be a multisegment with support
contained in some Zelevinsky line Πρ, then we can write

π(a) = Xb∈O(ρ)

m(b, a)Lb

(1.2.4)

where π(a) = ∆1 × · · · × ∆r, m(b, a) ∈ N. One of the aims of this thesis is
to give some new insights on these m(b, a).
Remark: For our purpose, note that we can also rewrite the equation 1.2.4
in the following form

La = Xb∈O(ρ) em(b, a)π(b).

(1.2.5)

The simplest example is given by

Proposition 1.2.6. (cf.
segments, then

[30] section 4.6 ) Let ∆1 and ∆2 be two linked

∆1 × ∆2 = La1 + La2
with a1 = {∆1, ∆2}, a2 = {∆1 ∪ ∆2, ∆1 ∩ ∆2}.

Remark: it is conjectured in [29] 8.7 that the coeﬃcient m(b, a) depends only
on the combinatorial relations of b and a, and not on the speciﬁc cuspidal
representation ρ. The independence of speciﬁc cuspidal representation can be
showed by type theory, see for example [26]. In other words, as far as we
are concerned with the coeﬃcient m(b, a), we can restrict ourselves
to the special case ρ = 1, the trivial representation of GL1(F ).

Deﬁnitions 1.2.7. Let

Π = {νk : k ∈ Z}

denote the Zelevinsky line of ρ = 1. We note

• Σ the set of segments associated to Π,

• O the set of multisegments associated to Σ,

• R the subalgebra of Runiv generate by the elements in La with a ∈ O,

• C = {f : Σ → N with ﬁnite support},

• S = {ϕ : Z → N}.

Notation 1.2.8. For i ≤ j, we will identify L[νi,νj] ∈ R with [i, j]( for
simplicity we let [i] = [i, i]). More generally we denote a multisegment a by

Xi≤j

aij[i, j].

8

Proposition 1.2.9. By associating to f ∈ C the multisegment

X∆∈Σ

f (∆)∆,

we can identify C with O. For every element b ∈ O, we set fb for the
associated function in C.

Deﬁnition 1.2.10. For a multisegment

a =Xi≤j

aij[i, j]

with fa associated function in C, let

ϕa =X∆∈a

fa(∆)χ∆ ∈ S.

We call ϕa the weight of a, and we call deg(a) = Xk∈N

a(or, the degree of La).

ϕa(k) the degree of

Deﬁnition 1.2.11. For ϕ ∈ S, let S(ϕ) be the set of multisegments with
weight ϕ.

1.3 A partial order on O

Deﬁnition 1.3.1. For a a multisegment, by an elementary operation, we
mean replacing two linked segments {∆1, ∆2} by {∆1 ∪ ∆2, ∆1 ∩ ∆2} in a.

Notation 1.3.2. Let b be a multisegment such that it can be obtained from
a by a series of elementary operations, then we say b ≤ a. We denote

S(a) = {b : b ≤ a}.

Deﬁnition 1.3.3. We deﬁne for b ≤ a,

ℓ(b, a) = max

{n : a = b0 ≥ b1 · · · ≥ bn = b},

n

and ℓ(a) = ℓ(amin, a).

Deﬁnition 1.3.4. We deﬁne the following total order relations on Σ:

(cid:26)

[j, k] ≺ [m, n], if k < n,

[j, k] ≺ [m, n], if j > m, n = k.

9

Lemma 1.3.5. Let b ∈ S(a), then π(a) − π(b) ≥ 0 in R.

Proof. By choosing a maximal chain of multisegments between a and b, we
can assume that

a = {∆1, · · · , ∆r},

b = (a\{∆j, ∆k}) ∪ {∆j ∩ ∆k, ∆j ∪ ∆k}.

Then by proposition 1.2.6,

π(a) = π(b) + L∆1 × · · · ×bL∆j × · · · ×bL∆k × · · · × L∆r × L{∆j ,∆k}

Proposition 1.3.6. The set S(a) is a partially ordered ﬁnite set with unique
minimal element amin. Furthermore, amin is the unique multisegment in S(a)
in which no segment is linked to the others.

Remark: in particular by proposition 1.1.13 a multisegment a is minimal if
and only if π(a) is irreducible.

Proof. For a proof of the partial orderness, we refer to [29] 7.1. Let Xa :=
∪∆∈a∆ be a subset of the Zelevinsky line Π. Let ϕa be the weight function
of a. Let Σ(a) be the set of segments with support in Xa: this is a ﬁnite
set. For every ∆ ∈ Σ(a), we note χ∆ the characteristic function of the set
∆. Now we consider the set

Γ(a) = {f ∈ C : ϕa = X∆∈Σ

f (∆)χ∆}.

Then Γ(a) is a ﬁnite set. Clearly, for any b ∈ S(a), we have fb ∈ C since
the elementary operation does not change the weight function, note that b
is uniquely determined by fb, so S(a) is ﬁnite since Γ(a) is ﬁnite.
We deﬁne amin = {∆1, ∆2, · · · , ∆r} with ∆1 (cid:23) · · · (cid:23) ∆r, where for ∆0 = ∅,
we set ∆i be the maximal segment with respect to the total order ≺, such
that χ∆i is supported in Supp(ϕa − χ∆0 − · · · − χ∆i−1).
We only need to show that for all b ∈ S(a), we have amin ≤ b. To see this,
we look at a maximal segment ∆′ in b, if it is linked to some segments ∆′′,
then we apply the elementary operation to them and get b1. Now repeat the
same procedure, in ﬁnite steps we get a multisegment b′ ≤ b in which no
segments are linked to the others. It remains to show that b′ = amin.
In fact, we have

ϕa = X∆∈Σ(a)

famin(∆)χ∆ = X∆∈Σ(a)

fb′(∆)χ∆.

s ≺ ∆s.
By the equality (1.3.7), e(∆s) = e(∆′

Concerning the coeﬃcient m(b, a), we have

Proposition 1.3.8. (cf.[29] 7.1) The coeﬃcient m(b, a) is

• nonzero if and only if b ≤ a, and

• equal to 1 if b = a.

1.4 Partial Derivatives

In this section we show how to deﬁne some analogue of the Zelevinsky deriva-
tion. This section will not be used until Chapter 7 but some of the properties
of partial derivation will appear all along the text.

Deﬁnition 1.4.1. We deﬁne a left partial derivation with respect to index i
to be a morphism of algebras

iD : R → R,
iD(L[j,k]) = L[j,k] + δi,jL[j+1,k] if (k > j),
iD(L[j]) = L[j] + δ[i],[j].

Also we deﬁne a right partial derivation with respect to index i to be a mor-
phism of algebras

D i : R → R
D i(L[j,k]) = L[j,k] + δi,kL[j,k−1] if (j < k)
D i(L[j]) = L[j] + δ[i],[j].

11

Deﬁnition 1.4.2. We deﬁne

D [i,j] = D j ◦ · · · ◦ D i

[i,j]D = (iD) ◦ · · · ◦ (j D)

And for c = {∆1, · · · , ∆s} with

we deﬁne

and

∆1 (cid:22) · · · (cid:22) ∆s,

D c = D ∆1 ◦ · · · ◦ D ∆s

cD = (∆s D) ◦ · · · ◦ (∆1D).

Remark: we recall that in [5] 4.5, Zelevinsky deﬁnes a derivative D to be an
algebraic morphism

D : R → R,

which plays a crucial role in Zelevinsky’s classiﬁcation theorem.
The relation between Jacquet functor and derivative is given by

Proposition 1.4.3. (cf. [29]3.8) Let δ be the algebraic morphism such that
δ(ρ) = 1 for all ρ ∈ C and δ(L∆) = 0 for all non cuspidal representations
L∆. Then

D = (1 ⊗ δ) ◦ c,

where c is the co-multiplication.

The main advantage to work with partial derivatives instead of the derivative
deﬁned by Zelevinsky is that they are much more simpler but share the
following positivity properties:

Theorem 1.4.4. Let a be any multisegment, then we have

D i(La) = Xb∈O

n(b, a)Lb,

such that n(b, a) ≥ 0, for all b.

Remark: the same property of positivity holds for iD.
The theorem follows from the following two lemmas

Deﬁnition 1.4.5. For i ∈ Z, let φi be the morphism of algebras deﬁned by

φi : R → Z

φi([j, k]) = δ[i],[j,k].

12

Lemma 1.4.6. For all multisegment a, we have φi(La) = 1 if and only if a
contains no other segments than [i], otherwise it is zero.

Proof. We prove this result by induction on the cardinality of S(a), denoted
by |S(a)|. If |S(a)| = 1, then a = amin, hence φi(La) = φi(π(a)), which is
nonzero if and only if a contains no other segments than [i], and in latter
case it is 1. Let a be a general multi-segment,

π(a) = La +Xb<a

m(b, a)Lb.

Now |S(a)| > 1, we know that a is not minimal in S(a), hence a contains
segments other than [i], which implies φi(π(a)) = 0.
Since |S(b)| < |S(a)| for any b < a, by induction, we know that φi(Lb) = 0
because b must contain segments other than [i]. So we are done.

Lemma 1.4.7. We have D i = (1 ⊗ φi) ◦ c.

Proof. Since both are algebraic morphisms, we only need to check that they
coincide on generators. We recall the equation from [29], proposition 3.4

c(L[j,k]) = 1 ⊗ L[j,k] +

k−1Xr=j

L[j,r] ⊗ L[r+1,k] + L[j,k] ⊗ 1.

Now applying φi,

(1 ⊗ φi)c(L[j,k]) =L[j,k] + δi,kL[j,k−1] if (k > j)
(1 ⊗ φi)c(L[j]) =L[j,k] + δi,j,

where δi,j is the Kronecker symbol. Comparing this with the deﬁnition of D i
yields the result.

Remark: We have the following relation between partial derivative and deriva-
tive of Zelevinsky. Let e(a) = {[i1], · · · , [iα] : i1 ≤ · · · ≤ iα} be the end of a,
then

D(a) = D [i1,iα](a).

Chapter 2

Schubert varieties and KL
polynomials

In this chapter we recall some of the geometric constructions of Zelevinsky:
the nilpotent orbital varieties and their relation with Schubert varieties.

Concretely, for a, b multisegments of degree n such that the nilpotent or-
bit Oa is included in the closure of Ob, the germs of intersection complexe
IC(Ob) at a generic point of Oa gives the Poincar´e polynomial Pa,b(q) and
Zelevinsky conjectured that

mb,a = Pa,b(1) = Pσ(a),σ(b)(1)

viewed in the Schubert variety associated to the symmetric group Sn, where
σ(a) and σ(b) are certain permutations attached to a and b. This conjecture
was proved by Chriss-Ginzburg [10], and Ariki [1].

In the following, we study the case of symmetric multisegments in the sense
of deﬁnition 2.1.5. The set of symmetric multisegment of some speciﬁc weight
ϕ is indexed by Sm, where m = max
ϕ(k), which is in general strictly smaller
k∈Z

ϕ(k). In this symmetric situation, we construct a ﬁ-

than its degree= Xk

bration from the symmetric locus in the orbital varieties Eϕ to some smooth
variety, where the stratiﬁcation of Eϕ gives rise to a stratiﬁcation of the
ﬁbers. And we show that the ﬁber is isomorphic to some Schubert variety of
type Am−1, which identiﬁes the stratiﬁcation of ﬁber with the stratiﬁcation
by Schubert cells.

15

2.1 Symmetric multisegments

Before we introduce the symmetric multisegments, we present a type of mul-
tisegments which is more general and will be used in Chapter 6.

Deﬁnition 2.1.1. We say a multisegment a is ordinary if there exists no
two segments in a that possesses the same beginning or end.

Example 2.1.2. Some typical examples of ordinary multisegments: let a =
{∆1, ∆2, ∆3}, and b = {∆4, ∆5, ∆6}

∆1 = [1, 4], ∆2 = [2, 5], ∆3 = [3, 6],

∆4 = [1, 2], ∆5 = [2, 4], ∆6. = [4, 5]

Figure 2.1: Ordinary multi-segments

Proposition 2.1.3. If a is ordinary then every b ≤ a is ordinary.

Proof. From the deﬁnition, b is ordinary if and only if each element in e(b)
and b(b) appears with multiplicity one. We deduce from the following lemma
that b ≤ a is also ordinary.

Lemma 2.1.4. Note that for b ≤ a, we have e(b) ⊆ e(a) and b(b) ⊆ b(a)(cf.
notation 1.1.10).

Proof. In fact, by transitivity, we only need to check this for case where b
can be obtained from a by applying the elementary operation to the pair
{∆1 ≺ ∆2}. Hence

b = a \ {∆1, ∆2} ∪ {∆1 ∪ ∆2, ∆1 ∩ ∆2}.

Note that e(∆1 ∪ ∆2) = e(∆2), b(∆1 ∪ ∆2) = b(∆1), and if ∆1 ∩ ∆2 6= ∅,
e(∆1 ∩ ∆2) = e(∆1), b(∆1 ∩ ∆2) = b(∆2). Hence b(b) ⊆ b(a), e(b) ⊆
e(a).

16

Deﬁnition 2.1.5. Let a = {∆1, · · · , ∆n} be ordinary. We say that a is
symmetric if

max{b(∆i) : i = 1, · · · , n} ≤ min{e(∆i) : i = 1, · · · , n}.

To explain the link with the symmetric group, we recall some basic facts
about the symmetric group Sn(cf.
[6]). Let (i, j) be the transposition ex-
changing i and j, then

S = {σi := (i, i + 1) : i = 1, · · · n − 1}

form a system of generators of Sn.

Deﬁnition 2.1.6. For w ∈ Sn, its length ℓ(w) is the smallest integer k such
that

w = s1s2 · · · sk, with si ∈ S, for i = 1, · · · , k.

On Sn, we have the famous Bruhat order which is deﬁned as follow:

Deﬁnition 2.1.7. Let T = {wsw−1 : w ∈ Sn, s ∈ S}. For u, w ∈ Sn,

(i) We write u

t

/ w , if u−1w = t ∈ T and ℓ(u) < ℓ(w).

(ii) We write u

/ w , if u

t

/ w for some t ∈ T .

(iii) We write u ≤ w if there exists a sequence of wi ∈ Sn, such that

u → w1 → w2 → · · · → wk = w.

This deﬁnes a partial order on Sn, which is called the Bruhat order.

Proposition 2.1.8. Let aId = {∆1, · · · , ∆n} be symmetric, such that

b(∆1) < · · · < b(∆n),

e(∆1) < · · · < e(∆n).

Then for w ∈ Sn, the formula

Φ(w) =

nXi=1

[b(∆i), e(∆w(i))]

deﬁnes a bijection between Sn and S(aId). Moreover, the order relation on
S(aId) induces the inverse Bruhat order, i.e.,

w ≤ v ⇔ Φ(w) ≥ Φ(v).

17

/
/
/
Example 2.1.9. Let n = 3 and aId = {∆1, ∆2, ∆3} with

∆1 = [1, 4], ∆2 = [2, 5], ∆3 = [3, 6].

Then Φ(σ1) = {∆4, ∆5, ∆6} with

∆4 = [1, 5], ∆5 = [2, 4], ∆6 = [3, 6].

Figure 2.2: Symmetric multi-segments

Proof. The injectivity is clear. We observe that Φ(Id) = aId. We show now
that Φ(w) ∈ S(aId) for general w and the partial order on S(aId) induces the
inverse Bruhat order.

(1) For v ≤ w, by the chain property of Bruhat order(cf.

[6] Theorem

2.2.6), we have

v = w0 < w1 < · · · < wα = w,

such that wγ = σiγ−1,jγ−1wγ−1 for some iγ−1 < jγ−1 and ℓ(wγ) =
ℓ(wγ−1) + 1. Now by lemma 2.1.4 of [6], we know that

w−1

γ−1(iγ−1) < w−1

γ−1(jγ−1).

Hence the segments

[b(∆w−1

γ−1(iγ−1)), e(∆iγ−1)]

[b(∆w−1

γ−1(jγ−1)), e(∆jγ−1)]

are linked in Φ(wγ−1). Moreover, by performing the elementary opera-
tion on the two segments, we obtain Φ(wγ), hence

Φ(wγ−1) > P hi(wγ).

18

Again by transitivity of partial orders, we are done. Note that we
proved that all Φ(w) are in S(aId). Moreover, for any b ∈ S(aId), the
fact that aId is symmetric implies b(aId) = b(b) since no segment is
juxtaposed to the others. The same reason shows that e(aId) = e(b).
Hence there is a unique w ∈ Sn such that

b =

nXi=1

[b(∆i), e(∆w(i))].

This proves the surjectivity.

(2) Let Φ(w) ≥ Φ(v), we choose

Φ(w) = Φ(w0) > Φ(w1) > · · · > Φ(wα) = Φ(v)

to be a maximal chain of multisegments, where Φ(wγ) is obtained from
Φ(wγ−1) by performing the elementary operation to segments

{[b(∆iγ−1), e(∆wγ−1(iγ−1))],

[b(∆jγ−1), e(∆wγ−1(jγ−1))]}

in Φ(wγ−1) with iγ−1 < jγ−1. Then

wγ−1(iγ−1) < wγ−1(jγ−1).

Hence

wγ = σwγ−1(iγ−1),wγ−1(jγ−1)wγ−1.

Note that in this case, we have either

or

wγ < wγ−1

wγ > wγ−1,

by (1), the former implies Φ(wγ−1) < Φ(wγ), contradiction to our as-
sumption.

Hence we must have

wγ > wγ−1.

We conclude by transitivity of partial order that w < v.

19

2.2 Nilpotent Orbits

In this section we shall introduce the nilpotent orbits constructed in [30] and
discuss their geometry and relations with multisegments.

Deﬁnition 2.2.1. (1) Let ϕ ∈ S (cf. Def. 1.2.7) such that supp ϕ =
{1, · · · , h}. Let Vϕ = ⊕k∈ZVϕ,k be a Z-graded C vector space such that
dim Vϕ,k = ϕ(k).

(2) Let Eϕ be the set of endomorphism T of Vϕ of degree 1, i.e. such that

T Vϕ,k ⊆ Vϕ,k+1.

Remark: (cf.[30], 1.8) Gϕ(C) =Yk∈Z

GL(Vϕ,k) acts on Eϕ by conjugation. For

each element T in Eϕ, there exists a basis of Vϕ that consists of homogeneous
elements, under which T is of the Jordan form .

Notation 2.2.2. From now on, for simplicity, in all circumstances, we will
write Gϕ for Gϕ(C), GLn for GLn(C) and Mi,j for Mi,j(C).

Lemma 2.2.3. By ﬁxing a basis for each Vk, we have

Eϕ ≃ Mϕ(2),ϕ(1) × · · · × Mϕ(h),ϕ(h−1)

Here we suppose that supp ϕ ⊆ [1, h] and Mk,ℓ denotes the vector space of
matrices over C with k rows and ℓ columns.

Remark: In this case, the group

Gϕ = GLϕ(1) × · · · × GLϕ(h)

acts by

(g1, · · · , gh).(f1, · · · , fh−1) = (g2f1g−1

h−1).

1 , g3f2g−1

2 , · · · , ghfh−1g−1

Proof. It follows directly from the deﬁnition of Eϕ.

Example 2.2.4. Consider the function ϕ = χ1+2χ2 +χ3 ∈ S(cf. Def 1.3.4),
where χk denotes the characteristic function of k. To ϕ we can attach the
space Vϕ = V1 ⊕ V2 ⊕ V3 such that

V1 = Cv1, V2 = Cv2 ⊕ Cv3, V3 = Cv4.

Consider the operator T ∈ Eϕ, such that

T (v1) = v2 − v3, T (v2) = T (v3) = v4.

20

Then by choosing a new basis

v′
1 = v1, v′

2 = v1 − v2, v′

3 = v1 + v3, v′

4 = 2v4,

we get

2, T (v′
which gives the Jordan form JT of T

1) = v′

T (v′

2) = 0, T (v′

3) = v′

Proposition 2.2.5. (cf.[30], 2.3) The orbits of Eϕ under Gϕ are naturally
parametrized by multisegments of weight ϕ.

Proof. Let a = Xi≤j

aij[i, j] such that ϕa = ϕ, then the orbit associated

consists of the operators having exactly aij Jordan cells starting from Vϕ,j
and ending in Vϕ,i.

Notation 2.2.6. We denote by Oa the orbit associated to the multisegment
a.

Example 2.2.7. We take the same function ϕ = χ1 +2χ2 +χ3 as in example
2.2.4. Then the multisegments of weight ϕ are listed below(cf. [29] section
11.4)

amax = {[1], [2], [2], [3]}, aℓ = {[1, 2], [2], [3]},

ar = {[1], [2], [2, 3]}, a0 = {[1, 2], [2, 3]}, amin = {[1, 3], [2]}.

And the corresponding Jordan forms are given by

Deﬁnition 2.2.9. For any T ∈ Eϕ, and i ≤ j, denote by T [i,j] the composi-
tion map:

we deﬁne

T /

rij(T ) = rank(T [i,j]).

Remark: For a a multisegment, rij(T ) remains constant for any T ∈ Oa, we
denote it by rij(a).
We recall the following combinatorial results

Proposition 2.2.10. (cf.
such that

[30]section 2.5) Let a, b be two multisegments

Then the following two conditions are equivalent:

ϕa = ϕb.

(1) b ≤ a;

(2) rij(a) ≤ rij(b) for all i ≤ j.

In symmetric case, we have the following interesting description of rij.

Lemma 2.2.11. Let w ∈ Sn. Then we have ri,j+n−1(w) := ri,j+n−1(Φ(w)) =
{k ≤ i : w(k) ≥ j}.

Proof. In fact, take

and consider the bijection

aId =

nXk=1

[k, k + n − 1],

Φ : Sn → S(aId)

with

Φ(w) =

nXk=1

[k, w(k) + n − 1].

By deﬁnition, ri,j+n−1(w) is the number of segments in LΦ(w) which contains
[i, j + n − 1], hence is of the form [k, w(k) + n − 1] with

k ≤ i, w(k) ≥ j.

Now combining with the proposition 2.2.10, gives the following known results,

Proposition 2.2.12. ([24] Proposition 2.1.12) In Sn, v ≤ w ⇔ rij(v) ≤
rij(w), for all i ≤ j.

2.3 Schubert Varieties and KL Polynomials

Let Y be an algebraic variety over C.

Deﬁnition 2.3.1. By a stratiﬁcation H on Y , we mean a decomposition of
Y into locally closed smooth sub-varieties Yi. An element of H is called a
stratum.

Remark: We require a variety to be irreducible.
Deﬁnition 2.3.2. Let Db(Y ) = Db
c(Y ) be the bounded derived category of
sheaves with values in complex vector spaces over Y . And let D(Y ) be the
subcategory consisting of those complexes whose cohomology sheaves are con-
structible.

Given a stratiﬁcation H, we let Uℓ denote the set of strata whose dimension
is ≥ ℓ.

Deﬁnition 2.3.3. (cf.[11] Remark 3.8.1) Given a local system on the open
stratum Ud with d = dim(Y ), we deﬁne inductively a complex IC(Y, L) in
D(Y ) as follows.
We start by letting IC(Ud, L) := L[dim Y ]. Assuming that we already deﬁned
IC(Uℓ+1, L), let j : Uℓ+1 → Uℓ be the open immersion, then we deﬁne

IC(Uℓ, L) := τ≤−ℓ−1Rj∗IC(Uℓ+1, L),

here τ≤k is the truncation from the right in degree k. In ﬁnite step, we get
IC(Y, L).

Notation 2.3.4. When we take L = C, which is always the case for us, we
denote IC(Y, C) by IC(Y ). In this case we denote

Hi(Y ) := Hi(IC(Y )).

Remark: The cohomology sheaves Hi(Y ) are locally constant over each stra-
tum in H.

Deﬁnition 2.3.5. Let n ≥ 1. By a Schubert variety of type An−1, we mean a
closed sub-variety of the projective variety GLn/Bn which is stable under the
multiplication by Bn from the left, where Bn is the Borel subgroup consisting
of upper triangular matrices.

Remark: Let V be a C vector space. Note that GLn acts transitively on the
set of complete ﬂags F (V ) := {(U i : i = 0, · · · , n) : 0 = U 0 ⊂ U 1 ⊂ · · · ⊂
U n = V, dim(U i) = i} and the stabilizer of a complete ﬂag is given by a Borel
subgroup. Hence by ﬁxing a complete ﬂag (V i : i = 0, · · · , n) and denoting
its stabilizer by B, we identify the variety GLn/B with F (V ), in this way,
we can consider the Schubert variety as a subset of F (V ).

23

[9] page 148.) We identify Sn with the set of
Proposition 2.3.6. (cf.
the permutation matrices in GLn. Then we have the Bruhat decomposition

GLn = aw∈Sn

BnwBn. Moreover, we have

BnwBn = av≤w

BnvBn.

Deﬁnition 2.3.7. We denote Cw := BnwBn/Bn in GLn/Bn and the Schu-
bert variety Xw = Cw.

Then for the Schubert variety Xw, we have a stratiﬁcation given by H =
{Cv : v ≤ w}.

Deﬁnition 2.3.8. Let v ≤ w, we deﬁne the Kazhdan Lusztig polynomial for
the pair v, w:

Pv,w(q) =Xi

q(i+dw)/2 dim Hi(Xw)xv,

where xv is an element in Cv and dw = dim(Xw) = ℓ(w).

Concerning the intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties, we have the
following purity theorem due to Kazhdan and Lusztig.

Theorem 2.3.9. ([16]) If i + ℓ(w) is odd, then the cohomology group

Hi(Xw) = 0.

Remark: This implies that Pv,w(q) is a polynomial in q.

2.4 Orbital Varieties and Schubert Varieties

Note that on the orbital variety Ob, we have a stratiﬁcation given by Hb =
{Oa : ϕa = ϕb, b ≤ a}.

Deﬁnition 2.4.1. Let a, b be two multisegments such that b ∈ S(a). Then
we deﬁne the polynomial

Pa,b(q) =Xi

q(i+db)/2 dim Hi(Ob)xa,

where xa ∈ Oa is an arbitrary point and db = dim(Ob). We call it the
Kazhdan Lusztig polynomial associated to {a, b}.

24

Remark: In [32] Theorem 1, Zelevinsky showed that the varieties Ob are
locally isomorphic to some Schubert varieties of type Am, where m = deg(b).
Hence again by theorem 2.3.9, we know that Pa,b is a polynomial in q.

Here, we brieﬂy recall Zelevinsky’s results in [32]. Let ϕ be a function in
S(cf. Def. 1.2.7) such that supp(ϕ) ⊆ [1, r]. We consider the ﬂag variety

F (ϕ) = {0 = U 0 ⊂ U 1 ⊂ · · · U r = Vϕ : dim(U i/U i−1) = ϕ(i), 1 ≤ i ≤ r}

We ﬁx the standard ﬂag

Fϕ = {0 = V 0

ϕ ⊆ V 1

ϕ · · · ⊆ V r

ϕ : V i

ϕ = Vϕ,1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vϕ,i} ∈ F (ϕ).

Deﬁnition 2.4.2. Let G(ϕ) be the subset of F (ϕ) containing the elements
(U i : 0 ≤ i ≤ r) ∈ F (ϕ) such that U i ⊇ V i−1

for i = 1, · · · , r.

ϕ

Zelevinsky deﬁned a map τ : Eϕ → G(ϕ), by associating to T ∈ Eϕ the
element τ (T ) = (U i : 0 ≤ i ≤ r) such that

U i = {(v1, · · · , vr) ∈ Vϕ,1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vϕ,r : vj+1 = T (vj), j ≥ i}.

Theorem 2.4.3. (cf.[32]Theorem 1) The morphism τ is an open immersion
into the Schubert variety G(ϕ).

In fact, for b a multisegment of weight ϕ, we can describe explicitly the image
bij[i, j], X b = (xij)

of Ob in terms of Schubert cells in G(ϕ). Let b = X1≤i≤j≤r

with

xij =bij,
xij =0,

for i ≤ j

for i > j + 1

xi,i−1 = Xn≤i−1,i≤m

bnm.

Example 2.4.4. Let ϕ = χ[1] + 2χ[2] + χ[3],a = [1, 2] + [2, 3], b = [1, 3] + [2].
And Xa = (xa

ij) be the matrix such that

ij), Xb = (xb

X a =


0 1 0
1 0 1
0 1 0


 , X b =


0 0 1
1 1 0
0 1 0




Deﬁnition 2.4.5. Let b be a multisegment of weight ϕ and

X b = (xi,j)1≤i,j≤r.

25

We deﬁne Yb to be the set of ﬂags

(U i : i = 0, 1, · · · , r) ∈ G(ϕ)

such that

dim((U i ∩ V j

ϕ )/(U i ∩ V j−1

ϕ + U i−1 ∩ V j

ϕ )) = xij, for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ r.

Example 2.4.6. Let a be the multisegment in example 2.4.4. We have Ya
be the set of ﬂags (U i : i = 0, 1, 2, 3) such that

dim(U 1 ∩ V 1
dim(U 1 ∩ V 2
dim(U 2 ∩ V 1

U 0 = 0;
ϕ ) = xa
ϕ ) = xa
ϕ ) = xa

11 = 0 ⇒ U 1 ∩ V 1
ϕ = 0;
12 = 1 ⇒ U 1 ⊆ V 2
ϕ ;
21 = 1 ⇒ U 2 ⊇ V 1
ϕ .

And

which implies

dim(U 2 ∩ V 2

ϕ /(U 2 ∩ V 1

ϕ + U 1 ∩ V 2

ϕ )) = xa

22 = 0,

U 2 ∩ V 2

ϕ = U 2 ∩ V 1

ϕ + U 1 ∩ V 2
ϕ ;

hence U 2 ∩ V 2
ﬂags (U i : i = 0, 1, 2, 3) satisfying

ϕ = V 1

ϕ + U 1, which is of dimension 2. Hence Ya is the set of

U 0 = 0, U 1 ∩ V 1

ϕ = 0, U 2 ∩ V 2

ϕ = V 1

ϕ + U 1, U 3 = V 3
ϕ .

Proposition 2.4.7. (cf. [32] Theorem 1.) We have Ob = Yb ∩ Eϕ.

Example 2.4.8. Again, let a = [1, 2] + [2, 3]. Let T ∈ Eϕ ∩ Ya, then we have
τ (T ) = (U i : i = 0, 1, 2, 3), satisfying

U 0 = 0, U 1 ∩ V 1

ϕ = 0, U 2 ∩ V 2

ϕ = V 1

ϕ + U 1, U 3 = V 3
ϕ .

By deﬁnition, if we write T = (T1, T2) such that

Ti : Vϕ,i → Vϕ,i+1,

i = 1, 2,

then

U 1 = {(v, T1v, T2T1v) ∈ Vϕ : v ∈ Vϕ,1},

and U 1 ∩ V 1

ϕ = 0 is equivalent to T1v 6= 0. Also, we have

U 2 = {(v1, v2, T2v2) ∈ Vϕ : v1 ∈ Vϕ,1, v2 ∈ Vϕ,2}.

26

Note that U 2 ∩ V 2

ϕ = V 1

ϕ + U 1 is equivalent to the following conditions

U 1 ⊆ V 2

ϕ , U 2 + Vϕ,2.

We know that U 1 ⊆ V 2
ϕ is equivalent to the fact that for any v ∈ Vϕ,1,
(v, T1v, T2T1v) ∈ Vϕ,2, hence T2T1v = 0. Furthermore, we know that U 2 +
Vϕ,2 is equivalent to the fact that there exits v ∈ Vϕ,2 such that (0, v, T2v) /∈
Vϕ,2, hence T2v 6= 0. Hence we obtain that T ∈ Eϕ ∩ Ya is equivalent to the
following facts

T1 6= 0,

T2T1 = 0,

T2 6= 0.

The latter is the same as to say that T ∈ Oa.

Deﬁnition 2.4.9. Let Bi(ϕ) = {j : Xm≤i−1

ϕ(m) < j ≤Xm≤i

ϕ(m)}.

S b = {w ∈ Sdeg(b) : Card(w(Bi(ϕ)) ∩ Bj(ϕ)) = xij, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ r}.

We denote by w(b) the unique element in S b of maximal length.

Example 2.4.10. In the example 2.4.4, we have

B1(ϕ) = {1}, B2(ϕ) = {2, 3}, B3(ϕ) = {4}.

Let a = [1, 2] + [2, 3]. Then by deﬁnition

S a = {w ∈ S4 : Card(w(Bi(ϕ)) ∩ Bj(ϕ)) = xa

ij, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 3}

Therefore, for w ∈ S a, we have

w(1), w(4) ∈ {2, 3}, {w(2), w(3)} ∩ {2, 3} = ∅,

therefore,

hence

{w(1), w(4)} = {2, 3}, {w(2), w(3)} = {1, 4},

w = (13)(24), or w = (12)(34),

compare the length, we have

The same method shows that

w(a) = (13)(24).

w(b) = (1423)

Note in the picture we denote a permutation by its image.

27

Figure 2.3: Bruhat Order for S4

Theorem 2.4.11. (cf. [32]) Let b′ ≥ b such that Yb′ ⊆ Y b, we have

Pb′,b(q) = Pw(b′),w(b)(q).

Theorem 2.4.12. ([30], [10]) Let Hi(Ob)a denote the stalk at a point x ∈ Oa
of the i-th intersection cohomology sheaf of the variety Ob. Then

m(b, a) = Pb,a(1).

Remark: The intersection cohomology is nonzero only if i + dim(Ob) is even.
Hence m(b, a) is the value at v = 1 of a certain Kazhdan Lusztig polynomial
for the symmetric group Sm with m = deg(b).
Remark: Combining with theorem 2.4.11, this theorem gives a complete cal-
culation of the coeﬃcients m(b, a). But as we have seen, this often involves
elements in a huge symmetric group, which is too clumsy. Moreover, another
diﬃculty arise from the description of the element w(b), which is not explicit.
Remark: In this chapter, for symmetric multisegments a and b, we will give
more concrete description about the coeﬃcient mb,a in terms of elements in
Sn with n equals to the number of segments contained in a, cf. corollary
2.5.9. For general case, we will give use the reduction method from chapter
4 to give a more concrete description.

2.5 Geometry of Symmetric Nilpotent Orbits

For the moment, we consider a special case of symmetric multisegments, we
assume that

aId =

fa(∆)χ∆.

nXi=1

[i, n + i − 1], ϕ =X∆∈a

We remind that we already constructed a bijection

Φ : Sn → S(aId)

such that Φ(Id) = aId.

Deﬁnition 2.5.1. Let

Ow = OΦ(w),

Also, let

be the natural projection with ﬁber Mn,n−1.
Now we want to describe the ﬁber of the restriction pϕ|Osym
ϕ .

Deﬁnition 2.5.3. We deﬁne GLn,n−1 to be the subset of Mn,n−1 consisting
of the matrices of rank n − 1.

We denote by pn : Mn,n ։ Mn,n−1 the morphism of forgetting the last column
of elements in Mn,n.
Remark: Now by restriction to GLn, we have the morphism

which satisﬁes the property that pn(g1g2) = g1pn(g2) for g1, g2 ∈ GLn.

pn : GLn ։ GLn,n−1,

Proposition 2.5.4. The morphism

is a ﬁbration. Furthermore, it induces a bijection

pn : GLn ։ GLn,n−1,

pn : Bn\GLn/Bn → Bn\GLn,n−1/Bn−1.

29



Proof. To see that it is locally trivial, note that pn is GLn equivariant with
GLn acting by multiplication from the left. Since GLn acts transitively on
itself, it acts also transitively on GLn,n−1. Now pn is equivariant implies
that all the ﬁbers of pn are isomorphic. Let H be the stabilizer of pn(Id),
then GLn,n−1 ≃ GLn/H, it is a ´etale locally trivial ﬁbration according to
Serre [28] proposition 3. By Bruhat decomposition, every g ∈ GLn admits a
decomposition

g = b1wb2,

bi ∈ Bn, i = 1, 2, w ∈ Sn,

here we identify Sn with the set of permutation matrices in GLn. We can
decompose b2 = b3v, where b3 ∈ GLn−1, which is identiﬁed with the direct
summand in the Levi subgroup GLn−1 × C×, and v − Id only contains non
zero elements in the last column, by deﬁnition,

pn(g) = b1pn(w)b3.

We obtain that pn induces

pn : Bn\GLn/Bn → Bn\GLn,n−1/Bn−1.

It is bijective because given pn(w), there is a unique way to reconstruct an
element which belongs to Sn.

Theorem 2.5.5. The morphism

pϕ|Osym

ϕ

is smooth with ﬁber GLn,n−1. Moreover, the morphism pϕ|Ow : Ow → pϕ(Osym
ϕ )
is surjective with ﬁber Bnpn(w)Bn−1.

Proof. Note that smoothness follows from that pϕ : Eϕ → Zϕ is smooth and
that Osym
is open in Eϕ. To see the rest of the properties, we ﬁx an element
ew in each orbit Ow as follow. Let (vij)(i = 1, · · · , 2n − 1, j = 1, · · · , ϕ(i))
be a basis of Vϕ,i, and an element ew satisfying

ϕ




here we put vi,0 = 0.

ew(vij) = vi+1,j,

for i < n − 1

ew(vn−1,j)= vn,w(j),
ew(vij) = vi+1,j−1,

,

for i ≥ n.

Example 2.5.6. Let w = (1, 2), then by the strategy in the proof, ew is given
by the following picture:

30

Figure 2.4:

Construction of ew in case n = 3

We claim that ew ∈ Ow. In fact, it suﬃces to observe that

ew : vii → · · · → vn−1,i → vn,w(i) → vn+1,w(i)−1 → · · · vn+w(i)−1,1,

which by proposition 2.2.5, implies that the multisegment indexing ew con-
tains [i, w(i) + n − 1] for all i = 1, · · · , n, hence it must be Φ(w). Note that,
by deﬁnition, we have

pϕ(eId) = pϕ(ew), for all w ∈ Sn.

Since pϕ is compatible with the action of Gϕ, we get

pϕ(Osym

ϕ ) = pϕ(Ow), for all w ∈ Sn,

which implies that p|Ow is surjective. Now it remains to characterize its
ϕ (T ′) ≃ Mn,n−1 in Eϕ. Moreover, for
ﬁber. Let T ′ ∈ pϕ(Osym
T = (T1, · · · , T2n−2) ∈ p−1

is in bijection with Bnpn(w)Bn−1 via p−1

ϕ (pϕ(eId)) ∩ Osym

ϕ ≃ GLn,n−1.

31

Proof. Now the element fw ∈ Ow is completely determined by the component

fw,n−1 : Vϕ,n−1 → Vϕ,n.

We know by proposition 2.2.5 that fw,n−1 is injective hence of rank n − 1.
Hence we have fw,n−1 ∈ GLn,n−1.
Now by proposition 2.5.4 we get Bn\GLn,n−1/Bn−1 is indexed by Sn, it re-
mains to see that fw,n−1 is in the class indexed by pn(w).
Finally, we note that pϕ is a morphism equivariant under the action of

Gϕ = GL1 × GL2 × · · · × GLn−1 × GLn × · · · × GL2 × GL1.

Since Gϕ acts transitively on Ow, the image of Ow is Gϕ.(pϕ(ew)), hence
is pϕ(OId). Now we prove that the stabilizer of pϕ(ew) is Bn × Bn−1. Let
eId = (e1, · · · , en−1, en, · · · , e2n−2) with ei ∈ Mi,i+1 if i < n and ei ∈ Mi,i−1 if
i ≥ n. We have

pϕ(eId) = (e1, · · · , en−2, en, · · · , e2n−2).

Let g = (g1, · · · , gn, gn+1, · · · , g2n−1) such that g.pϕ(eId) = pϕ(eId). Then by
deﬁnition for i < n − 1 we know that gi+1eig−1
i = ei. We prove by induction
on i that gi ∈ Bi ∈ GLi for i ≤ n − 1. For i = 1, we have nothing to prove.
Now assume that i ≤ n − 2, and gi ∈ Bi, we show that gi+1 ∈ Bi+1. Consider

gi+1eig−1

i (gi(vij)) = gi+1ei(vij) = gi+1(vi+1,j).

On the other hand, by induction, we know that

gi+1eig−1

i (gi(vij)) = ei(gi(vij)) ∈ ⊕k≤jCvi+1,k.

Therefore we have gi+1 ∈ Bi+1. Actually, since ei is injective, the equality
ei(gi(vij)) = gi+1(vi+1,j), implies that gi is completely determined by gi+1.
This shows that gn−1 ∈ Bn−1 it determines all gi for i ≥ n − 1. The same
method proves that gn ∈ Bn and it determines all gi for i ≥ n. We conclude
that the ﬁber of the morphism pϕ|Ow is isomorphic to Bnpn(w)Bn−1.

Corollary 2.5.8. We have for v ≤ w in Sn, and Xw the closure of BnwBn
in GLn,

dim Hi(O

sym
w )v = dim Hi(Xw)v,

for all i ∈ Z, here the index v on the left hand side means that we localize at
a generic point in Ov and on the right hand side means that we localize at a
generic point in Cv.

32

Proof. Since pϕ|Osym
smooth base change theorem to the following Cartesian diagram

is a ﬁbration with ﬁber GLn,n−1 over Zϕ, we apply the

ϕ

GLn,n−1

Osym

ϕ

pϕ(Φ(Id))

/ Zϕ.

We get

dim Hi(O

sym
w )v = dim Hi(Bnpn(w)Bn−1)Bnpn(v)Bn−1 .

Now apply proposition 2.5.4, we have

dim Hi(Bnpn(w)Bn−1)Bnpn(v)Bn−1 = dimHi(Xw)v.

Corollary 2.5.9. We have for v ≤ w in Sn,

mΦ(v),Φ(w) = Pv,w(1).

Proof. This follows from the fact that

dimXi

Hi(X(w))v = Pv,w(1)

(cf. [17]).

Chapter 3

Descent of Degrees for
Multisegment

To attack the question of calculating the coeﬃcient m(b, a), this ﬁrst naive
idea, which can trace back to Zelevinsky [29], is to use the (partial) deriva-
tion. If we believe that for b ∈ S(a), the coeﬃcient m(b, a) only depends
on the relative position between the segments in a, but not on the exact
multisegment a, we should be allowed to do some sort of truncation on the
multisegments simultaneously without changing the coeﬃcient m(b, a). It is
reasonable to think that the partial derivative should play the role of trun-
cation.

However, it is not true that we can always truncate. For example if we
take a = {[1, 2], [2, 3]} and we replace the segment [2, 3] by [2]( truncate at
the place 3), then we get a′ = {[1, 2], [2]}, this should not allowed because
we changed the linkedness relation between the two segments. And simple
calculation shows that

D 3(La) = La,

we quickly notice that D 3(La) does not achieve its minimal degree term La′,
which are supposed to appear.

Such examples lead us to think that we can do truncation only when our par-
tial derivative achieve its minimal degree terms. More explicitly, we should
avoid applying truncation to the multisegments as a above. This gives us
the hypothesis Hk(a)(deﬁnition 3.1.3). And satisfying the hypothesis Hk(a)
means that we can apply the truncation without changing the coeﬃcients.

35

3.1 Morphism for Descent of Degree of mul-

tisegment

For a multisegment a and k ∈ Z, we will introduce a hypothesis called Hk(a)
and let S(a)k be the set of elements in S(a) satisfying the hypothesis Hk(a).
We construct a multisegment a(k) and a morphism ψk : S(a)k → S(a(k)). We
show that the morphism ψk is surjective.

Notation 3.1.1. For ∆ = [i, j] a segment, we put

∆− =[i, j − 1],
∆+ =[i, j + 1],

−∆ = [i + 1, j],
+∆ = [i − 1, j].

Deﬁnition 3.1.2. Let k ∈ Z and ∆ be a segment, we deﬁne

∆(k) =(cid:26) ∆−, if e(∆) = k;

∆, otherwise .

For a multisegment a = {∆1, · · · , ∆r}, we deﬁne

a(k) = {∆(k)

1 , · · · , ∆(k)

r }.

Deﬁnition 3.1.3. We say that the multisegment b ∈ S(a) satisﬁes the
hypothesis Hk(a) if the following two conditions are veriﬁed
(1) deg(b(k)) = deg(a(k));

(2) there exists not a pair of linked segments {∆, ∆′} such that e(∆) =

k − 1, e(∆′) = k.

Deﬁnition 3.1.4. Let

eS(a)k = {c ∈ S(a) : deg(c(k)) = deg(a(k))}.

Lemma 3.1.5. Let c ∈ eS(a)k. Then

♯{∆ ∈ a : e(∆) = k} = ♯{∆ ∈ c : e(∆) = k}.

Proof. Note that

deg(a) = deg(a(k)) + ♯{∆ ∈ a : e(∆) = k}.

Now that for c ∈ eS(a)k

deg(c) = deg(a),

deg(c(k)) = deg(a(k)),

we have

♯{∆ ∈ a : e(∆) = k} = ♯{∆ ∈ c : e(∆) = k}.

36

Lemma 3.1.6. Let k ∈ Z

(a) For any b ∈ S(a), we have deg(b(k)) ≥ deg(a(k)).

(b) Let c ∈ eS(a)k, then for b ∈ S(a) such that b > c, we have b ∈ eS(a)k.
(c) Let b ∈ eS(a)k, then b(k) ∈ S(a(k)). Moreover, if we suppose that a

satisﬁes the hypothesis Hk(a) and b 6= a, then

b(k) ∈ S(a(k)) − {a(k)}

.

(d) Suppose that a does not verify the hypothesis Hk(a), then there exists a

b ∈ S(a) satisfying the hypothesis Hk(a), such that b(k) = a(k).

Proof. For (a), by lemma 2.1.4 for any b ∈ S(a), e(b) is a sub-multisegment
of e(a). And from b to b(k), we replace those segments ∆ such that e(∆) = k
by ∆−. Now (a) follows by counting the segments ending in k.
For (b), by (a), we have

deg(a(k)) ≤ deg(b(k)) ≤ deg(c(k)).

The fact that c ∈ eS(a)k implies that deg(a(k)) = deg(c(k)), hence deg(a(k)) =
deg(b(k)) and b ∈ eS(a)k.

As for (c), suppose that deg(b(k)) = deg(a(k)), we prove b(k) < a(k). Let

a = a0 > · · · > ar = b

be a maximal chain of multisegments, then by (b), we know deg(a(k)
deg(a(k)), for all j = 1, · · · , r. Our proof breaks into two parts.

If one of them ends in k, we assume e(∆′) = k.

j+1 from

Here we conclude that b(k) ∈ S(a(k)).

(2)Assuming that a satisﬁes the hypothesis Hk(a), we show that

a(k)
1 < a(k).

Let a1 be obtained from a by performing the elementary operation to ∆, ∆′.
We do it as in (1) but put j = 0. Note that in (1), the only case where we
can have a(k)
1 = a(k) is when ∆ precedes ∆′ and e(∆′) = k, e(∆) = k − 1.
But such a case can not exist since a veriﬁes the hypothesis Hk(a). Hence
we are done.
Finally, for (d), we construct b in the following way. Suppose that a does
not satisfy the hypothesis Hk(a), then there exists a pair of linked segments
{∆, ∆′} such that

e(∆) = k − 1,

e(∆′) = k,

let a1 be the multisegment obtained by applying the elementary operation
to ∆ and ∆′. We have

a(k)
1 = a(k).

If again a1 fails the hypothesis Hk(a), we repeat the same construction to
get a2, · · · , since

a > a1 > · · · .

In ﬁnite step, we get b satisfying the conditions in the theorem and

b(k) = a(k).

Remark: Actually, the multisegment constructed in (d) is unique, as we shall
see later(proposition 3.4.1).

38

Deﬁnition 3.1.7. We deﬁne a morphism

by sending c to c(k).

ψk : eS(a)k → S(a(k))

Proposition 3.1.8. The morphism ψk is surjective.

Proof. Let d ∈ S(a(k)), such that we have a maximal chain of multisegments,

a(k) = d0 > · · · > dr = d.

By induction, we can assume that there exists ci ∈ eS(a)k such that c(k)

i = di,
for all i < r. Assume we obtain d from dr−1 by performing the elementary
operation on the pair of linked segments {∆ ≺ ∆′}.

• If e(∆) 6= k − 1 and e(∆′) 6= k − 1, then we observe that the pair
of segments are actually contained in cr−1. Let cr be the multiseg-
ment obtained by performing the elementary operation to them . We
conclude that c(k)

• If e(∆) = k − 1, then ∆ ∈ cr−1 or ∆+ ∈ cr−1 and ∆′ ∈ cr−1. The
fact that dr−1 = c(k)
r−1 implies that k /∈ e(dr−1), hence e(∆′) > k.
Hence both ∆ and ∆+ are linked to ∆′. In either case we perform the
elementary operation to get cr such that c(k)

r = d.

r = dr, and c ∈ eS(a)k.

• If e(∆′) = k − 1, then ∆′ ∈ cr−1 or ∆′+ ∈ cr−1 and ∆ ∈ cr−1. The
same argument as in the second case shows that there exists cr such
that c(k)

r = d.

Actually, the proof in proposition 3.1.8 yields the following reﬁnement.

c(k) > d,

Corollary 3.1.9. Let c ∈ eS(a)k, d ∈ S(a(k)) such that
then there exists a multisegment e ∈ eS(a)k such that
Proof. Note that c ∈ eS(a)k implies eS(a)k ⊇ eS(c)k. Combine with the sur-

we get the result.

39

Deﬁnition 3.1.10. For a a multisegment, and k ∈ Z we deﬁne

S(a)k = {c ∈ eS(a)k : c satisﬁes the hypothesis Hk(a)}.

Proposition 3.1.11. The restriction

ψk : S(a)k → S(a(k))

c 7→ c(k)

is also surjective.

Proof. For d ∈ S(a(k)), by proposition 3.1.8, we know that there exists c ∈

exists c′ ∈ S(c)k such that c′(k) = c(k) = d. We conclude by the observation

eS(a)k such that c(k) = d. But by (d) in lemma 3.1.6, we know that there
that if c ∈ eS(a)k, then

S(c)k ⊆ S(a)k.

Also, concerning the corollary 3.1.9, we have the following

there exists a multisegment e ∈ S(c)k such that e(k) = d.

Corollary 3.1.12. Let c ∈ eS(a)k and d ∈ S(a(k)) such that c(k) > d. Then
Proof. By corollary 3.1.9, we know that there exists an e′ ∈ eS(c)k such that
that e(k) = e′(k) = d. Hence we conclude by the fact that if e′ ∈ eS(a)k, then

e′(k) = d. By (d) in lemma 3.1.6, we know that there exists e ∈ S(e′)k such

S(e′)k ⊆ S(a)k.

Deﬁnition 3.1.13. Let k ∈ Z and ∆ be a segment.

Let

(k)∆ =(cid:26) −∆, if b(∆) = k;

∆, otherwise .

a = {∆1, · · · , ∆r},

be a multisegment, we deﬁne

(k)a = {(k)∆1, · · · , (k)∆r, }.

Deﬁnition 3.1.14. We say that the multisegment b ∈ S(a) satisﬁes
hypothesis kH(a) if the following two conditions are veriﬁed

the

40

(1) deg((k)b) = deg((k)a);

(2) there exists no pair of linked segments {∆, ∆′} such that

b(∆) = k, b(∆′) = k + 1.

Remark: There exists a version of lemma 3.1.6 for (k)a.
In the following
sections, we will work exclusively with a(k) and the hypothesis Hk(a). But
all our results will remain valid if we replace a(k) by (k)a and Hk(a) by kH(a).

3.2

Injectivity of ψk: First Step

By previous section, we know there exists c ∈ S(a)k such that c(k) =
(amin)min, the minimal element in S(a(k)).
In this section, we give an ex-
plicit construction of such a c and show that it is the unique multisegment
in S(a)k which is set to (a(k))min by ψk.

• In proposition 3.2.3, we construct a multisegment c ∈ S(a1)k such that

c(k) = (a(k))min, where a1 is a multisegment such that a ∈ S(a1).

• We prove that there exists a unique element in S(a)k which is sent to

(a(k))min by ψk.

• Then we apply the uniqueness result to S(a1)k to prove that the con-

structed c before is in S(a)k.1

Notation 3.2.1. Let ℓk = fe(a)(k) (cf. Def.1.2.7).

Deﬁnition 3.2.2. Let

a0 = {∆ ∈ (a(k))min : e(∆) = k − 1}.

Proposition 3.2.3. Let a0 = {∆1 (cid:23) · · · (cid:23) ∆r}. Let c be a multisegment
such that

(1) If ϕa(k − 1) ≥ ϕa(k), then r = ϕa(k − 1) − ϕa(k) + ℓk. Let

c = ((a(k))min \ a0) ∪ {∆+

1 (cid:23) · · · (cid:23) ∆+
ℓk

(cid:23) ∆m+1 (cid:23) · · · (cid:23) ∆r}.

1 Here we use partial derivative to prove our result, but it can also be done in a purely

combinatorial way, which is less elegant and more lengthy though.

41

(2) If ϕa(k) − ℓk < ϕa(k − 1) < ϕa(k), then r = ϕa(k − 1) − ϕa(k) + ℓk. Let

c = ((a(k))min \ a0) ∪ {∆+

1 (cid:23) · · · (cid:23) ∆+

r ≻ [k] = · · · = [k]

}

|

ℓk−r

{z

}

(3) If ϕa(k − 1) ≤ ϕa(k) − ℓk, then a0 = ∅ and

c = a(k) + ℓk[k].

Then c satisﬁes the hypothesis Hk(c) and c(k) = (a(k))min.

Proof. We show only the case ϕa(k − 1) > ϕa(k), the proof for other cases is
similar. Note that we have the following equality

ϕa(k − 1) = ϕ(a(k))min(k − 1) = r + ♯{∆ ∈ (a(k))min : ∆ ⊇ [k − 1, k]}.

Moreover, ϕa(k − 1) > ϕa(k) implies that no segment in (a(k))min starts at k
by minimality, hence we also have

ϕa(k) = ϕ(a(k))min(k) + ℓk = ♯{∆ ∈ (a(k))min : ∆ ⊇ [k − 1, k]} + ℓk.

Now comparing the two formulas gives the equality r = ϕa(k−1)−ϕa(k)+ℓk.
By deﬁnition we have c(k) = (a(k))min. To check that c satisﬁes the hypothesis
Hk(c), it suﬃces to note that (a(k))min \ a0 does not contain segment which
ends in k − 1.

Lemma 3.2.4. Let c ∈ S(c)k be a multisegment such that c(k) is minimal.
Then if d ∈ S(c) such that d(k) = c(k), then c = d

Proof. Suppose that d < c is a multisegment such that d(k) = c(k). Consider
the maximal chain of multisegments

c = c0 > · · · > ct = d.

Our assumption implies that c(k)
i = c(k) for all i = 1, · · · , t by lemma 3.1.6.
Hence we can assume t = 1 and consider d ∈ S(c) to be a multisegment
obtained by applying the elementary operation to the pair of linked segments
{∆ ≺ ∆′}.

• If e(∆) 6= k, e(∆′) 6= k, then the pair {∆, ∆′} also appears in c(k),

contradict the fact that c(k) is minimal.

• If e(∆′) = k, then by the fact that c ∈ S(c)k, we know that e(∆) <
k − 1, which implies that the pair {∆, ∆−} is linked and belongs to
c(k),contradiction.

42

• If e(∆′) = k and b(∆′) < k + 1, then the pair {∆−, ∆′} is still linked

and belongs to c(k), contradiction.

Hence we must have e(∆′) = k and b(∆′) = k+1, this implies that deg(d(k)) >

deg(c(k)) and d /∈ eS(c)k. Finally, (b) of lemma 3.1.6 implies that for all d < c,
we have d /∈ eS(c)k.

Proposition 3.2.5. Let c ∈ S(c)k be a multisegment such that c(k) is min-
imal. Then the partial derivative D k(Lc) contains in R a unique term of
minimal degree Lc(k), which appears with multiplicity one.

Proof. Let c = {∆1, · · · , ∆r} such that e(∆t) = k if and only if t = i, · · · , j
with i ≤ j. Then

D k(π(c)) = ∆1 × · · · × ∆i−1 × (∆i + ∆−

i ) × · · · × (∆j + ∆−

j ) × ∆j+1 × · · · × ∆r

with minimal degree term given by

π(c(k)) = ∆1 × · · · × ∆i−1 × ∆−

i × · · · × ∆−

j × ∆j+1 × · · · × ∆r.

The same calculation shows that for any d ∈ S(c), the minimal degree terms
in D k(π(d)) is given by π(d(k)), whose degree is strictly greater than that

is a non-negative sum of irreducible representations ( Theorem 1.4.4), which
cannot contain any representation of degree equal to that of c(k), by compar-
m(e, d)D k(Le). Finally,

of c(k) since by previous lemma we know that d /∈ eS(c)k. Note that D k(Ld)
ing the minimal degree terms in D k(π(d)) and Xe∈S(d)
comparing the minimal degree terms in D k(π(c)) and Xe∈S(c)

m(e, c)D k(Le)

gives the proposition.

Proposition 3.2.6. Let a be a multisegment. Then S(a)k contains a unique
multisegment c such that c(k) = (a(k))min.

Proof. Let a = {∆′
with i ≤ j. Then

43

Note that in π(a(k)), m((a(k))min, a(k)) = 1(cf. [30]). Now compare with the
m(d, a)D k(Ld) and apply the proposition

terms of minimal degree in Xd∈S(a)

3.2.6 yields the uniqueness of c such that c(k) = (a(k))min.

Proposition 3.2.7. Let c be the multisegment constructed in proposition
3.2.3. Then c ∈ S(a).

Proof. Let

a1 = a(k) + m[k],

then we observe that a ∈ S(a1). Because of c ∈ S((a(k))min + m[k]), we have
c ∈ S(a1). Note that since deg((a1)(k)) = deg(c(k)), the fact that c ∈ S(c)k
implies that c ∈ S(a1)k. Now let d ∈ S(a)k, then we have d ∈ S(a1)k since
deg(d(k)) = deg(a(k)
1 ) = deg(a(k)). Assume furthermore that d(k) is minimal,
then by proposition 3.2.6, we know that such a multisegment in S(a1)k is
unique, which implies d = c.

Corollary 3.2.8. Let c ∈ S(a)k such that c(k) = (a(k))min, then c is minimal

in eS(a)k.
Proof. By corollary 3.1.12, we know that for any d ∈ eS(a)k, there exists

a multisegment c′ ∈ S(a)k with c′(k) = (a(k))min, such that d > c′. By
uniqueness, we must have c = c′.

3.3 Geometry of Nilpotent Orbits: General

Cases

In this section, we show geometrically that the morphism

ψk : S(a)k → S(a(k))

c 7→ c(k)

is bijective, satisfying the properties

(1) For c ∈ S(a)k, we have m(c, a) = m(c(k), a(k)).

(2) The morphism ψk preserves the order, i.e, for c, d ∈ S(a)k, c > d if and

only if c(k) > d(k).

44

To achieve this, ﬁrstly we consider the sub-variety X k

a = ac∈ eS(a)k

Oc, and

construct a ﬁbration α from X k
a to Gr(ℓk, Vϕa,k), the latter is the space of the
ℓk-dimensional subspace of Vϕa,k. Secondly, we construct an open immersion

τW : (X k

a )W → Ya(k) × Hom(Vϕa,k−1, W ),

where (X k

a )W is the ﬁber over W with respect to α and Ya(k) = ac∈S(a(k))

Oc.

Our main diﬃculty here lies in proving that τW is actually an open immersion.
The idea is to apply Zariski Main theorem, to do this, we have to prove the
normality and irreducibility of both varieties. Irreducibility of (X k
a )W follows
from our results in previous section, and normality follows from the ﬁbration
α and the fact that orbital varieties are locally isomorphic to some Schubert
varieties, by Zelevinsky, cf. [32].
Once we prove that τW is an open immersion. All the desired properties of
ψk follow.

Here we ﬁx a multisegment a and let ϕ = ϕa.

be seen from the simple example of the aﬃne plane A2 endowed with the stratiﬁcation

X1 = A2 − A1, X2 = A1 − pt, X3 = pt.

If we are interested in X1a X3, it is better to study A2, because there is no nontrivial
directed extension of X1 by X3. Instead, if we are interested in X1a X2, we can study

A2 − pt, which is already a nontrivial extension.

45

Let c ∈ eS(a)k, T ∈ Oc, then

Lemma 3.3.2. Let ϕ = ϕa. We have dim(ker(T |Vϕ,k)) = ♯{∆ ∈ a : e(∆) =
k} = ℓk(Notation 3.2.1), which does not depend on the choice of T .

Proof. The fact T ∈ Oc implies

dim(ker(T |Vϕ,k)) = ♯{∆ ∈ c : e(∆) = k}.

Then our lemma follows from lemma 3.1.5.

Deﬁnition 3.3.3. Let

Gr(ℓk, Vϕ) = {W ⊆ Vϕ,k : dim(W ) = ℓk},

and for W ∈ Gr(ℓk, Vϕ), let

Vϕ/W = Vϕ,1 ⊕ · · · Vϕ,k−1 ⊕ Vϕ,k/W ⊕ · · · .

Also, we denote by

pW : Vϕ → Vϕ/W

the canonical projection.

Deﬁnition 3.3.4. We deﬁne

eZ k = {(T, W ) : W ∈ Gr(ℓk, Vϕ), T ∈ End(V /W ) of degree +1},

and the canonical projection

π :eZ k → Gr(ℓk, Vϕ)

(T, W ) 7→ W.

Proposition 3.3.5. The morphism π is a ﬁbration with ﬁber

Eϕa(k) ( Def.2.2.1).

Proof. This follows from the deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 3.3.6. Assume b, c ∈ S(a(k)).

Od}.

• Let

Z k,a(c) = {(T, W ) ∈ Z k,a, T ∈ Oc}.

Remark: The restriction of π to Z k,a is a ﬁbration with ﬁber Ya(k).

Deﬁnition 3.3.7. Now we deﬁne T (k) ∈ End(V / ker(T |Vϕ,k)) such that

T (k)|Vϕ,i =


T |Vϕ,i, for i 6= k, k − 1,
pT,k ◦ T |Vϕ,i, for i = k − 1
T |Vϕ,i ◦ pT,k, for i = k.

where pT,k : Vϕ → Vϕ/ ker(T |Vϕ,k) is the canonical projection.

This gives naturally an element (T (k), ker(T |Vϕ,k)) in Z k,a. We construct a
morphism

by

γk : X k

a → Z k,a.

γk(T ) = (T (k), ker(T |Vϕ,k )).

Deﬁnition 3.3.8. We deﬁne

α : X k

with α(T ) = ker(T |Vϕ,k).

Proof. We have to show that α is locally trivial. We ﬁx W ∈ Gr(ℓk, Vϕ) Note
that GLϕ(k) acts transitively on Gr(ℓk, Vϕ). Let PW be the stabilizer of W .
Then by Serre [28] proposition 3, we know that the principle bundle

GLϕ(k) → GLϕ(k)/PW

is ´etale-locally trivial. Here the base GLϕ(k)/PW is isomorphic to Gr(ℓk, Vϕ).
It is even Zariski-locally trivial because PW is parabolic, which is special in
the sense of Serre [28], § 4. Now we can write

We claim that δ is an isomorphism.
g ∈ GLϕ(k) such that

In fact, for any T ∈ X k

a , we choose

This implies g.T ∈ α−1(W ), thus

g(ker(T |Vϕ,k )) = W.

δ([g−1, g.T ]) = T.

This shows the surjectivity. For injectivity, it is enough to show that

δ([g, T ]) = g.T ∈ α−1(W )

implies g ∈ PW . But this is by deﬁnition of PW .
The fact that α is locally trivial then can be deduced from that of

GLϕ(k) ×PW α−1(W ),

while the latter is a consequence of the fact that GLϕ(k) is locally trivial over
Gr(ℓk, Vϕ).
Finally, we want to show the surjectivity of the orbit α|Oc. This is a conse-
quence the fact that GLϕ(k) acts transitively on Gr(ℓk, Vϕ).

m = ♯{∆ ∈ c : e(∆) = k, deg(∆) ≥ 2} ≤ min{ℓk, dim(ker(T0|Vϕ,k−1))}.

We choose a splitting Vϕ,k = W ⊕ Vϕ,k/W and let T ′ : Vϕ,k−1 → W be a
linear morphism of rank m. Finally, we deﬁne T ∈ γ−1
k ((T0, W )) by letting

T |Vϕ,k−1 = T ′ ⊕ T0|Vϕ,k−1,

T |Vϕ,k = T0|Vϕ,k/W ◦ pW ,

T |Vϕ,i = T |Vϕ,i, for i 6= k − 1, k.

Let

{∆ ∈ c : e(∆) = k, deg(∆) ≥ 2} = {∆1, · · · , ∆m},

dim(T ′(Wi)) − dim(T (Wi−1)) = dim(Wi/Wi−1),

Since such T ′ always exists, we are done.

a is contained and is open in the irreducible variety Oc. Now by [32]

a is actually normal.

By proposition 3.3.9, we know that α is a ﬁbration between two varieties X k
and Gr(ℓk, Vϕ). The fact that both are normal and irreducible implies that
the ﬁber (X k

a )W is normal and irreducible.

Remark: Note that by deﬁnition, we are allowed to identify (Z k,a)W with
Ya(k). This is what we do from now on.

Deﬁnition 3.3.13. We choose a splitting Vϕ,k = W ⊕ Vϕ,k/W and denote
by qW : Vϕ,k → W the projection. We deﬁne a morphism τW

τW (T ) = ((γk)W (T ), qW ◦ T |Vϕ,k−1).

Remark: Then we have the following commutative diagram

where s is the canonical projection.

Lemma 3.3.14. The morphism τW is injective.

Proof. Note that any T ∈ (X k
a )W is determined by (γk)W (T ) and T |Vϕ,k−1.
Furthermore, T |Vϕ,k−1 is determined by pW ◦ T |Vϕ,k−1 and qW ◦ T |Vϕ,k−1. Since
pW ◦ T |Vϕ,k−1 is a component of (γk)W (T ), it is determined by (γk)W (T ) and
qW ◦ T |Vϕ,k−1. This gives us the injectivity.

Lemma 3.3.15. Let c ∈ S(a)k such that c(k) = (a(k))min. Then The image
of Oc ∩ (X k

a )W is open in Oc(k) × Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W ).

Proof. Let c ∈ S(a)k such that c(k) = (a(k))min. We shall use the description
in proposition 3.2.3. We show that the image of

Oc ∩ (X k

a )W

is open in Oc(k) × Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W ).
Let T ∈ (Oc)W . We check case by case:

(1) If ϕ(k − 1) ≤ ϕ(k) − ℓk, the fact c(k) = (a(k))min implies that T (k)|Vϕ,k−1
is injective. As a consequence we have Im(T |Vϕ,k−1) ∩ W = 0. Hence
for any element T0 ∈ Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W ) , we deﬁne T0 ∈ Oc, such that

T0|Vϕ,k−1 = T0 ⊕ T (k)|Vϕ,k−1,

which lies in the ﬁber over (γk)−1
3.3.10, every element in Oc(k) comes from some element in Oc, hence

W ((T (k), W )). Since by proposition

τW (Oc ∩ (X k

a )W ) = Oc(k) × Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W ),

which is open.

(2) If ϕ(k) − ℓk < ϕ(k − 1) < ϕ(k), the fact c(k) = (a(k))min implies that the

morphism

T (k)|Vϕ,k−1

contains a kernel of dimension

ϕ(k − 1) − ϕ(k) + ℓk.

Our description of c in proposition 3.2.3 shows that in this case

dim(Im(T |Vϕ,k−1) ∩ W ) = ϕ(k − 1) − ϕ(k) + ℓk.

In this situation, given an element T0 ∈ Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W ) we deﬁne
T ′ ∈ Eϕ, such that

T ′|Vϕ,k−1 = T0 ⊕ T (k)|Vϕ,k−1,

T ′|Vϕ,k = T (k)|Vϕ,k/W ◦ pW ,

T ′|Vϕ,i = T (k), for i 6= k − 1, k.

By construction and proposition 2.2.5, we know that T ′ ∈ Oc if and
only if T ′|Vϕ,k−1 is injective, since no segment in c ends in k − 1, as
described in proposition 3.2.3. And this is equivalent to say

T0|ker(T (k)|Vϕ,k−1 )

is injective. This is an open condition, hence Oc ∩ (X k
Oc(k) × Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W ).

a )W is open in

(3) If ϕ(k − 1) ≥ ϕ(k), then by proposition 3.2.3

implies

c(k) = (a(k))min

Im(T |Vϕ,k−1) ⊇ W.

Recall the notation from proposition 3.2.3

a0 = {∆1 (cid:23) · · · (cid:23) ∆r}.

with r = ϕ(k − 1) − ϕ(k) + ℓk. Then

c = ((a(k))min \ a0) ∪ {∆+

1 (cid:23) · · · (cid:23) ∆+
ℓk

(cid:23) ∆ℓk+1 (cid:23) · · · (cid:23) ∆r}.

51

Let T0 ∈ Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W ), we deﬁne T ′ ∈ Eϕ

T ′|Vϕ,k−1 = T0 ⊕ T (k)|Vϕ,k−1,

T ′|Vϕ,k = T (k)|Vϕ,k/W ◦ pW ,

T ′|Vϕ,i = T (k), for i 6= k − 1, k.

Consider the following ﬂag over Vϕ,k−1,

ker(T (k)|ϕ,k−1) = Vr ⊇ · · · ⊇ V1 ⊇ V0 = 0,

where Vi = Im((T (k))∆i) ∩ ker(T (k)|ϕ,k−1), with i = 1, · · · , r, for the
notation (T (k))∆, we refer to deﬁnition 2.2.9.
Now by proposition 2.2.5, we know that T ′ ∈ Oc if and only if

dim(T0(Vi)) − dim(T0(Vi−1)) = dim(Vi/Vi−1),

for i = 1, · · · , ℓk. In fact, if Vi 6= Vi−1, then

dim(Vi/Vi−1) = ♯{j : ∆j = ∆i}.

And by construction, if i ≤ ℓk, by proposition 2.2.5, the fact that c
contains ∆+
i

implies that if T ′ ∈ Oc,

dim(T0(Vi)) − dim(T0(Vi−1)) = dim(Vi/Vi−1).

The converse holds by the same reason.
Again, this is an open condition, which proves that Oc ∩ (X k
in Oc(k) × Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W ).

a )W is open

Proposition 3.3.16. The morphism τW is an open immersion.

Proof. To see that it is open immersion, we shall use Zariski’s main theorem.
Since all Schubert varieties are normal, we observe that

(Z k,a)W × Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W )

are normal by theorem 1 of [32]. Also, by proposition 3.3.12, we know that
(X k

a )W is irreducible and normal, hence τW is an open immersion.

52

Proposition 3.3.17. Let c ∈ eS(a)k. Then c ∈ S(a)k if and only if

Oc ∩ (X k

a )W

is open in

(Oc(k) × Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W )).

Proof. We already showed that

Oc ∩ (X k

a )W

Oc(k) × Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W ).

is a sub-variety of

Moreover, we know that

(Oc(k) × Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W )) ∩ (X k

a )W

is open in

Oc(k) × Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W )

since τW is open. Finally, by proposition 3.3.10,

(Oc(k) × Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W )) ∩ (X k

ad∈ eS(a)k,d(k)=c(k)

The variety (Oc(k) × Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W )) ∩ (X k

a )W is irreducible because (Oc(k) ×
Od ∩

ad∈ eS(a)k,d(k)=c(k)

a )W by locally closed sub-varieties can only contain one term which is

(X k
open, from the point of view of Zariski topology. Since for any element

d′ ∈ {d ∈ eS(a)k, d(k) = c(k)},

by (d) of lemma 3.1.6, we know that there exists c′ ∈ S(a)k such that d′ > c′.
Hence we conclude that

{d ∈ eS(a)k, d(k) = c(k)},

contains a unique minimal element, which lies in S(a)k. Now our proposition
follows.

53

Corollary 3.3.18. Let a be a multisegment and

then

c ∈ S(a)k,

Pa,c(q) = Pa(k),c(k)(q).

Proof. First of all, by proposition 3.3.9 and Kunneth formula, we know that

Hj(Oc)a = Hj(Oc ∩ (X (k)

a )W )a,

the localization being taken at a point in Oa ∩ (X (k)
3.3.16 and proposition 3.3.17 , we may regard Oc ∩(X (k)
of Oc(k) × Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W ), hence

a )W . Now by proposition
a )W as an open subset

Hj(Oc ∩ (X (k)

a )W )a = Hj(Oc(k) × Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W ))a(k)

and Kunneth formula implies that the latter is equal to

Hj(Oc(k))a(k).

Corollary 3.3.19. Let d ∈ S(a) such that

and

then c < d, and

d(k) = a(k),

c ∈ S(a)k,

Pa,c(q) = Pd,c(q).

Proof. By corollary 3.1.12, we know that there exists c′ ∈ S(a)k such that

d > c′, c′(k) = c(k).

And proposition 3.3.17 implies c′ = c. Finally, applying the corollary 3.3.18
to the pairs {a, c} and {d, c} yields the result.

54

3.4 Conclusion

In this section, we draw some conclusions from what we have done before,
espectially the properties related to ψk.

Proposition 3.4.1. The map

is bijective. Moreover,

• for c ∈ S(a)k

ψk : S(a)k → S(a(k))

c 7→ c(k)

m(c, a) = m(c(k), a(k)).

• for b, c ∈ S(a)k, we have b > c if and only if b(k) > c(k).

Proof. By proposition 3.3.17, we know that ψk is injective. Surjectivity is
given by proposition 3.1.11.
For c ∈ S(a)k,

m(c, a) = m(c(k), a(k))

is by corollary 3.3.18 by putting q = 1, and applying theorem 2.4.12.
Finally, for b, c ∈ S(a)k, if b > c, then c ∈ S(b(k), b), and by lemma 3.1.6,
we know that b(k) > c(k). Reciprocally, if b(k) > c(k), by proposition 3.3.17,
we know that Ob ⊆ Oc, hence b > c.

Corollary 3.4.2. We have

•

π(a(k)) = Xc∈S(a)k

m(c, a)Lc(k),

(3.4.3)

• let b ∈ S(a) such that b satisﬁes the hypothesis Hk(a) and b(k) = a(k),

then

m(b, a) = 1, S(a)k = S(b)k.

Proof. The ﬁrst part follows from the fact that ψk is bijective and m(c, a) =
m(c(k), a(k)). For the second part of the lemma, we note that Lb(k) = La(k) ap-
pears with multiplicity one in π(a(k)), then equation (3.4.3) implies m(b, a) =
m(b(k), a(k)) = 1. To see that S(a)k = S(b)k ⊆ S(b). Note that we have
S(b)k ⊆ S(a)k and two bijection

ψk : S(a)k → S(a(k)),

ψk : S(b)k → S(b(k)) = S(a(k)),
Hence comparing the cardinality gives S(a)k = S(b)k.

55

3.5 Minimal Degree Terms in Partial Deriva-

tives

Proposition 3.5.1. (i) Suppose that a satisﬁes the hypothesis Hk(a).

Then D k(La) contains in R a unique irreducible representation of min-
imal degree, which is La(k), and it appears with multiplicity one.

(ii) If a fails to satisfy the hypothesis Hk(a), then

La(k) will not appear in D k(La), and the irreducible representations
appearing are all of degree > deg(a(k)).

Proof. Let a = {∆1 (cid:22) · · · (cid:22) ∆r}, such that

e(∆1) ≤ · · · < e(∆i) = · · · = e(∆j) < · · · ≤ e(∆r),

with k = e(∆i).
We prove the proposition by induction on ℓ(a)(cf. deﬁnition 1.3.3). For,
ℓ(a) = 0, which means that a = amin, in this case a satisﬁes the Hk(a), and

D k(La) = D k(π(a)) = ∆1 × · · · × (∆i + ∆−

i ) × · · · × (∆j + ∆−

j ) × · · ·

which contains

La(k) = π(a(k)) = ∆1 × · · · × ∆−

i × · · · ∆−

j × · · · .

Hence we are done.
For general a, we have refer to the lemma 3.1.6.
We write

π(a) = La +Xb<a

m(b, a)Lb.

(3.5.2)

Now applying D k to both sides and consider only the lowest degree terms,
on the left hand side, we get

π(a(k)) = ∆1 × · · · × ∆i−1 × ∆−

i × · · · × ∆−

j × · · · ∆r.

(3.5.3)

By theorem 1.4.4, both sides are positive sum of irreducible representations,
then

• If a satisﬁes the hypothesis Hk(a), on the right hand side, from our
lemma 3.1.6 and induction, we know that for all b < a, D k(Lb) does
not contain La(k) as subquotient, hence D k(La) must contain La(k) with

56

multiplicity one. We have to show that it does not contain other sub-
quotients of π(a(k)). Note that by induction, we have the following
formula

π(a(k)) = X + Xc∈S(a)k\a

m(c, a)Lc(k),

where X denotes the minimal degree terms in D k(La). Now apply
corollary 3.4.2, we conclude that X = La(k).

• Now if a fails to satisfy the hypothesis Hk(a), a /∈ S(a)k, by proposition
3.4.1 and induction, we know that there exists b ∈ S(a)k, such that
a(k) = b(k) and D k(Lb) contains La(k) as a subquotient with multiplicity
one.

Now by the lemma 1.3.5, π(a) − π(b) is a positive sum of irreducible
representations which contain La: by the positivity of partial derivative,
we know that we obtain a positive sum of irreducible representations
after applying D k. Now

D k(π(a) − π(b)) = π(a(k)) − π(b(k)) + higher degree terms

contains only terms of degree > deg(a(k)), so does D k(La).

This ﬁnishes our induction.

Corollary 3.5.4. Let a be a multisegment such that ϕe(a)(k) = 1. Then

• If a ∈ S(a)k, then D k(La) = La + La(k).

• If a /∈ S(a)k, then D k(La) = La.

Proof. First of all, we observe that the highest degree term in D k(La) is given
by La. In fact, we have

D k(π(a)) = D k(La) +Xb<a

m(b, a)D k(Lb),

meanwhile we have

D k(π(a)) = π(a) + lower terms.

By induction on ℓ(a) we conclude that the highest degree terms in D k(La)
is La.

57

If a ∈ S(a)k, then proposition 3.5.1 implies that the minimal degree term of
D k(La), but since deg(a(k)) = deg(a) − 1, therefore we must have

D k(La) = La + La(k).

On the contrary, if a /∈ S(a)k, then by (ii) of the proposition 3.5.1, we
know that all irreducible representations appearing in D k(La) are of degree
> deg(a(k)) = deg(a) − 1, which implies

D k(La) = La.

58

Chapter 4

Reduction to symmetric cases

- In the ﬁrst paragraph of this chapter, we generalize the construction of
chapter 3 by iterating the truncation functor to obtain for c1, c2 two multi-
segments, the truncation (c1)b(c2) of a multisegment b.
- Then we give an algorithm to, starting from two multisegments a and
b ∈ S(a), construct two symmetric multisegments asym and bsym ∈ S(asym)
such that we have the following equality

m(b, a) = m(bsym, asym).

- Then we study some examples and we show how our algorithm works for
ﬁnding the coeﬃcient m(b, a).
- Finally, in the last paragraph, we give a proof of the Zelevinsky’s conjecture
stated in the introduction.

4.1 Minimal Degree Terms

The goal of this section is to deﬁne the set S(a)d ⊆ S(a) and describe some
of its properties.

Deﬁnition 4.1.1. Let (k1, · · · , kr) be a sequence of integers. We deﬁne

a(k1,··· ,kr) = (((a(k1)) · · · )(kr)).

Notation 4.1.2. Let ∆ = [k, ℓ], we denote

a(∆) = a(k,··· ,ℓ).

More generally, for d = {∆1 (cid:22) · · · (cid:22) ∆r}, let

a(d) = (· · · ((a(∆r))(∆r−1)) · · · )(∆1).

59

Deﬁnition 4.1.3. Let (k1, · · · , kr) be a sequence of integers , then we deﬁne

S(a)k1,··· ,kr = {c ∈ S(a) : c(k1,··· ,ki) ∈ S(a(k1,··· ,ki))ki+1, for i = 1, · · · , r}.

and

ψk1,··· ,kr : S(a)k1,··· ,kr → S(a(k1,··· ,kr)),

sending c to c(k1,··· ,kr).

Notation 4.1.4. Let d = {∆1 (cid:22) · · · (cid:22) ∆r} such that ∆i = [ki, ℓi]. We
denote

and

S(a)d := S(a)kr,··· ,ℓr,kr−1,··· ,k1,··· ,ℓ1

ψd := ψkr,··· ,ℓr,kr−1,··· ,k1,··· ,ℓ1.

Proposition 4.1.5. Let (k1, · · · , kr) be a sequence of integers . Then the set
S(a)k1,··· ,kr is non-empty. In fact, we have a bijective morphism

ψk1,··· ,kr : S(a)k1,··· ,kr → S(a(k1,··· ,kr)).

Moreover,

(1) For c ∈ S(a)k1,··· ,kr, we have

m(c, a) = m(c(k1,··· ,kr), a(k1,··· ,kr)).

(2) For b, c ∈ S(a)k1,··· ,kr, then b > c if and only if b(k1,··· ,kr) > c(k1,··· ,kr).

(3) We have

π(a(k1,··· ,kr)) = Xc∈S(a)k1,··· ,kr

m(c, a)Lc(k1,··· ,kr ).

(4) Let b ∈ S(a)k1,··· ,kr and b(k1,··· ,kr) = a(k1,··· ,kr), then

S(a)k1,··· ,kr = S(b)k1,··· ,kr.

Proof. Injectivity follows from the fact

ψk1,··· ,kr = ψkr ◦ ψkr−1 ◦ · · · ◦ ψk1.

For surjectivity, let d ∈ S(a(k1,··· ,kr)), we construct b inductively such that
ψk1,··· ,kr(b) = d. Let ar = d, assume that we already construct ai ∈
S(a(k1,··· ,ki))ki+1 satisfying that

a(ki+1,··· ,kj)
i

∈ S(a(k1,··· ,kj ))kj+1

60

for all i < j ≤ r and a(ki+1,··· ,kr)
Note that by the bijectivity of the morphism

= d.

i

ψki : S(a(k1,··· ,ki−1))ki → S(a(k1,··· ,ki)),

there exists a unique ai−1 ∈ S(a(k1,··· ,ki−1))ki, such that

a(ki)
i−1 = ai.

Finally, take b = a0 ∈ S(a)k1,··· ,kr. We show (1) by induction on r. The case
for r = 1 is by proposition 3.4.1. For general r, by induction

m(c, a) = m(c(k1,··· ,kr−1), a(k1,··· ,kr−1)),

and now apply the case r = 1 to the pair c(k1,··· ,kr−1), a(k1,··· ,kr−1) gives

m(c(k1,··· ,kr−1), a(k1,··· ,kr−1)) = m(c(k1,··· ,kr), a(k1,··· ,kr)).

Hence

m(c, a) = m(c(k1,··· ,kr), a(k1,··· ,kr)).

Also, to show (2), it suﬃces to apply successively the proposition 3.4.1. And
(3) follows from the bijectivity of ψk1,··· ,kr and (1). As for (4), we know by
deﬁnition,

S(a)k1,··· ,kr ⊇ S(b)k1,··· ,kr .

We know that any for c ∈ S(a)k1,··· ,kr, we have c(k1,··· ,kr) ≤ b(k1,··· ,kr), by (2),
this implies that c ≤ b. Hence we are done.

Similarly, we have

Deﬁnition 4.1.6. Let (k1, · · · , kr) be a sequence of integers, then we deﬁne

kr,··· ,k1S(a) = {c ∈ S(a) : (ki,··· ,k1)c ∈ ki+1S((ki,··· ,k1)a), for i = 1, · · · , r}.

and

kr,··· ,k1ψ : kr,··· ,k1S(a) → S((kr,··· ,k1)a),

sending c to (kr,··· ,k1)c.

Notation 4.1.7. Let d = {∆1, · · · , ∆r} such that ∆i = [ki, ℓi] with k1 ≤
· · · ≤ kr We denote

and

dS(a) :=kr,··· ,ℓr,kr−1,··· ,k1,··· ,ℓ1 S(a),

dψ :=kr,··· ,ℓr,kr−1,··· ,k1,··· ,ℓ1 ψ.

61

Remark: Let k1, k2 be two integers. In general, we do not have

k2(S(a)k1) = (k2S(a))k1.

For example, let k1 = k2 = 1, a = {[1], [2]}, then

k2(S(a)k1) = {a}, (k2S(a))k1 = {[1, 2]}.

Notation 4.1.8. We write for multisegments d1, d2, a,

d2S(a)d1 := (d2S(a))d1, S(a)d1,d2 := (S(a)d1)d2.

and

And for b ∈ S(a),

d2ψd1 := (d2ψ)d1, ψd1,d2 := (ψd1)d2

(d2)b(d1) := (d2b)(d1), b(d1,d2) := (b(d1))(d2).

4.2 Reduction to symmetric case

Now we return to the main question, i.e., the calculation of the coeﬃcient
m(c, a) for c ∈ S(a). Before we go into the details, we describe our strategies:

(i) Find a symmetric multisegment, denoted by asym, such that La is the

minimal degree term in some partial derivative of Lasym.

(ii) For c ∈ S(a), ﬁnd csym ∈ S(asym), such that we have m(c, a) =

m(csym, asym).

Proposition 4.2.1. Let a be any multisegment, then there exists an ordinary
multisegment b, and two multisegments ci, i = 1, 2 such that

b ∈ c2S(b)c1, a = (c2)b(c1)

Proof. Let a = {∆1, · · · , ∆r} be such that

∆1 (cid:22) · · · (cid:22) ∆r,

and

e(∆1) ≤ · · · < e(∆j) = · · · = e(∆i) < e(∆i+1) ≤ · · · ,

such that ∆j is the smallest multisegment in a such that e(∆j) appears in e(a)
with multiplicity greater than 1. Let ∆1 = [e(∆i) + 1, ℓ] be a segment, where
ℓ is the maximal integer such that for any m such that e(∆i) ≤ m ≤ ℓ − 1,

62

there is a segment in a which ends in m. Let a1 be the multisegment obtained
by replacing ∆i by ∆+
i , and all ∆ ∈ a such that e(∆) ∈ (e(∆i), ℓ] by ∆+.
Now we continue the previous construction with a1 to get a2 · · · , until we get
a multisegment ar1 such that e(ar1) contains no segment with multiplicity
greater than 1. Let

c1 = {∆1, ∆2, · · · , ∆r1}.

Note that by construction, we have

∆1 ≺ ∆2 ≺ · · · ≺ ∆r1.

And we show that ar1 ∈ S(ar1)c1. Note that

ai = a(∆r1 ,··· ,∆i+1)

r1

,

by induction on r1, we can assume that a1 ∈ S(ar1)∆r1 ,··· ,∆2 and show that
a ∈ S(a1)∆1. We observe that in a1, by construction, with the notations
above, ∆j, · · · , ∆i−1 are the only segments in a1 that ends in e(∆i), and ∆+
i
is the only segment in a1 that ends in e(∆i) + 1. Hence we conclude that
a1 ∈ S(a1)e(∆i)+1. And for e(∆i) + 1 < m ≤ ℓ, we know that a(e(∆1)+1,··· ,m−1)
does not contain a segment which ends in m − 1, hence a(e(∆1)+1,··· ,m−1)
∈
S(a(e(∆1)+1,··· ,m−1)
Now same construction can be applied to show that there exists a multiseg-
ment ar2 such that b(ar2) contains no segment with multiplicity greater than
1, and

)m. We are done by putting m = ℓ.

1

1

1

such that

c2 = {1∆, · · · ,r2 ∆},

ar2 ∈ c2S(a2), ar1 = (c2)ar2

as minimal degree component.
Note that in this way we construct an ordinary multisegment b = ar2,

b ∈ c2S(b)c1, a = (c2)b(c1)

To ﬁnish our strategy (i), we are reduced to consider the case of ordinary
multisegments.

Proposition 4.2.2. Let b be an ordinary multisegment, then there exists a
symmetric multisegment bsym, and a multisegment c such that such that

bsym ∈ S(bsym)c, b = bsym, (c).

63

Proof. In general b is not symmetric, i.e, we do not have min{e(∆) : ∆ ∈
b} ≥ max{b(∆) : ∆ ∈ b}. Let

b = {∆1, · · · , ∆r},

b(∆1) > · · · > b(∆r).

so that

b(∆1) = max{b(∆i) : i = 1, · · · , r}.

If b is not symmetric, let ∆1 = [ℓ, b(∆1) − 1] with ℓ maximal satisfying that
for any m such that ℓ − 1 ≤ m ≤ b(∆1), there is a segment in b starting
in m. We construct b1 by replacing every segment ∆ in b ending in ∆1 by
+∆. Repeat this construction with b1 to get b2 · · · , until we get bsym = bs,
which is symmetric. Let c = {∆1, · · · , ∆s}, then as before, we have

bsym ∈ cS(bsym), b = (c)(bsym).

As a corollary, we know that

Corollary 4.2.3. For any multisegment a, we can ﬁnd a symmetric multi-
segment asym and three multisegments ci, i = 1, 2, 3, such that

asym ∈ c2,c3S(asym)c1, a = (c2,c3)asym,(c1).

Now applying proposition 4.1.5

Proposition 4.2.4. The morphism

c2,c3ψc1 : c2,c3S(asym)c1 → S(a)

is bijective, and for b ∈ S(a), there exists a unique bsym ∈ S(asym) such that

m(b, a) = m(bsym, asym).

4.3 Examples

In this section we shall give some examples to illustrate the idea of reduction
to symmetric case.
We ﬁrst take a = {[1], [2], [2], [3]} to show how to reduce a general multiseg-
ment to an ordinary multisegment. The procedure is showed in the following
picture.
Here we have a2 = {[0, 1], [1, 3], [2], [3, 4]}, such that

64

Figure 4.1:

Figure 4.2:

a2 ∈ [0,1]S(a2)[3,4], a = ([0,1])a([3,4])

2

Next, we reduce the ordinary multisegment a2 to a multisegment asym, as is
showed in the following picture.
Here,we have

asym = {[0, 3], [1, 5], [2, 4], [3, 6]} = Φ(w)

where w = σ2 ∈ S4.
Now we take b = {[1, 2], [2, 3]}, we want to ﬁnd bsym ∈ S(asym) such that
m(b, a) = m(bsym, asym). Actually, following the procedure in Figure 2
above, we have

Figure 4.3:

Here we get b2 = {[0, 3], [1], [2, 4]}. Again, follow the procedure in Figure 3
above gives

65

Figure 4.4:

Hence we get

bsym = {[0, 5], [1, 3], [2, 6], [3, 4]} = Φ(v)

with v = (13)(24) ∈ S4. From [29] section 11.3, we know that m(b, a) = 2,
hence we get m(bsym, asym) = 2.
Remark: We showed in section 2 that

m(bsym, asym) = Pv,w(1),

where Pv,w(q) is the Kazhdan Lusztig polynomial associated to v, w. One
knows that Pv,w(q) = 1 + q, hence Pv,w(1) = 2.
As we have seen, to each multisegment, we have (at least) two diﬀerent ways
to attach a Kazhdan Lusztig polynomial:
(1)To use the Zelevinsky construction as described in section 4.2.
(2)To ﬁrst construct an associated symmetric multisegment, and then attach
the corresponding Kazhdan Lusztig polynomial.

Remark: In general, for a > b, (1) gives a polynomial P Z
a,b which is a Kazh-
dan Lusztig polynomial for the symmetric group Sdeg(a). And (2) gives a
polynomial P S
a,b, which is a KL polynomial for a symmetric group Sn with
n ≤ deg(a). It may happen that n = deg(a). By corollary 3.3.18, we always
have P Z

a,b = P S

a,b.

Example 4.3.1. Consider a = {1, 2, 2, 3}, b = {[1, 2], [3, 4]}, then by [30]
section 3.4, we know that P Z
a,b = 1 + q. And the symmetrization of a and b
are given by

asym = Ψ((2, 3)), bsym = Ψ((1, 3)(2, 4)).

Hence P S
for the pair ((2, 3), (1, 3)(2, 4)) in S4

a,b = P(2,3),(1,3)(2,4) = 1 + q, which is the Kazhdan Lusztig polynomial

4.4 Proof of the Zelevinsky’s conjecture

Deﬁnition 4.4.1. The relation type between 2 segments {∆, ∆′} is one of
the following

• ∆ cover ∆′ if ∆ ⊇ ∆′;

• linked but not juxtaposed if ∆ does not cover ∆′ and ∆∪∆′ is a segment

but ∆ ∩ ∆′ 6= ∅;

• juxtaposed if ∆ ∪ ∆′ is a segment but ∆ ∩ ∆′ = ∅;

• unrelated if ∆ ∩ ∆′ = ∅ and ∆, ∆′ are not linked.

Deﬁnition 4.4.2. Two multisegments

a = {∆1, · · · , ∆r}

and

have the same relation type if

• r = r′;

• there exists a bijection

a′ = {∆′

1, · · · , ∆′

r′}

ξ : a → a′

of multisets which preserves the partial order (cid:22) and relation type of
segments and induces bijection of multisets

e(ξ) : e(a) → e(a′),

b(ξ) : b(a) → b(a′).

satisfying

e(ξ)(e(∆)) = e(ξ(∆)),

b(ξ)(b(∆)) = b(ξ(∆)).

Lemma 4.4.3. Let a and a′ be of the same relation type induced by ξ. Let
{∆1 (cid:22) ∆2} be linked in a. Denote by a1(a′
1, resp.) the multisegment obtained
by applying the elementary operation to {∆1, ∆2}( {ξ(∆1), ξ(∆2)}, resp.).
Then a1 and a′

1 also have the same relation type.

Proof. We deﬁne a bijection

ξ1 : a1 → a′
1

by

and

ξ1(∆1 ∪ ∆2) = ξ(∆1) ∪ ξ(∆2),

ξ1(∆1 ∩ ∆2) = ξ(∆1) ∩ ξ(∆2)

ξ1(∆) = ξ(∆),

for all ∆ ∈ a \ {∆1, ∆2}.

67

It induces a bijection between the end multisets e(a1) and e(a′
1) as well as
the beginning multisets b(a1) and b(a′
1). Also the morphism ξ preserves the
partial order follows from the fact that for x, y ∈ e(a) such that x ≤ y,
then e(ξ1)(x) = e(ξ)(x) ≤ e(ξ1)(y) = e(ξ)(y)( The same fact holds for b(ξ1)).
Finally, it remains to show that ξ1 respects the relation type. Let ∆ (cid:22) ∆′ be
two segments in a1, if non of them is contained in {∆1 ∪ ∆2, ∆1 ∩ ∆2}, then
ξ1(∆) = ξ(∆) and ξ1(∆′) = ξ(∆′) and they are in the same relation type
as {∆, ∆′} by assumption. For simplicity, we only discuss the case where
∆ = ∆1 ∪ ∆2 but ∆′ is not contained in {∆1 ∪ ∆2, ∆1 ∩ ∆2}, other cases are
similar.

• If ∆′ cover ∆, then ∆ cover ∆1 and ∆2, hence ξ1(∆) = ξ(∆) cover

ξ(∆1) and ξ(∆2), which implies ξ1(∆′) covers ξ1(∆).

• If ∆′ is linked to ∆ but not juxtaposed, then either ∆′ covers ∆2 and
linked to ∆1, or ∆′ is linked to ∆2 but not juxtaposed. In both cases
we have ξ(∆′) is linked to ξ(∆1) ∪ ξ(∆2) and not juxtaposed.

• If ∆′ is juxtaposed to ∆, then ∆′ is juxtaposed to ∆2 since ∆2 (cid:23)
∆1. Therefore ξ(∆′) is juxtaposed to ξ(∆2) which implies ξ1(∆′) is
juxtaposed to the segment ξ1(∆).

• If ∆′ is unrelated to ∆1 ∪ ∆2, then it is unrelated to both ∆1 and ∆2

with ∆2 (cid:22) ∆′, this implies that ξ(∆′) is unrelated to ξ(∆1) ∪ ξ(∆2).

Remark: As every element b ∈ S(a) is obtained from a by a sequence of
elementary operations, we can deﬁne an application of poset

Ξ : S(a) −→ S(a′).

Lemma 4.4.4. The application Ξ is well deﬁned and bijective.

Proof. We give a new deﬁnition of Ξ in the following way. For b ∈ S(a), we
deﬁne

Ξ(b) = {[b(ξ)(b(∆)), e(ξ)(e(∆))] : ∆ ∈ b}

such a deﬁnition is independent of the choice of elementary operations. It
remains to see that it coincides with the one using elementary operation. In
fact, let a1 be a multisegment obtained by applying the elementary operation
to the pair of segments {∆1 (cid:22) ∆2}, then by our original deﬁnition of Ξ, it
sends a1 to a′
1 in the previous lemma. Now by the new deﬁnition, we have
Ξ(a1) given by

{ξ(∆) : ∆ ∈ a\{∆1, ∆2}}∪{[b(ξ)(b(∆1)), b(ξ)(b(∆2))], [b(ξ)(b(∆2)), b(ξ)(b(∆1))]}.

68

By our deﬁnition of ξ, we get

[b(ξ)(b(∆1)), b(ξ)(b(∆2))] = ξ(∆1) ∪ ξ(∆2),

and

[b(ξ)(b(∆2)), b(ξ)(b(∆1))] = ξ(∆1) ∩ ξ(∆2).

Hence we conclude that Ξ is well deﬁned. Note that by our deﬁnition, ξ is
invertible, which gives ξ−1, and in the same way we can construct Ξ−1. Now
we have

ΞΞ−1 = Id, Ξ−1Ξ = Id

by our deﬁnition above using b(ξ) and e(ξ). This shows that Ξ is bijective.

Theorem 4.4.5. For a and a′ having the same relation type, then for b ∈
S(a) with b′ = Ξ(b), we have

m(b, a) = m(b′, a′).

Proof. First of all, we consider the case where a and a′ are symmetric mul-
tisegments. Let a = Φ(w) by ﬁxing a map

Φ : Sn → S(aId).

Now since a and a′ have the same relation type, we know that a′ = Φ′(w)
for some ﬁxe map

Φ′ : Sn → S(a′
Finally, let a = {∆1, · · · , ∆n} and a′ = {∆′

Id).
1, · · · , ∆′

n} such that

b(∆1) < · · · < b(∆n), ∆′

i = ξ(∆i).

Without loss of generality, we assume that b(∆1) = b(∆′
1). We can assume
that b(∆i) = b(∆i−1) + 1. In fact, if b(∆i) > b(∆i−1) + 1, then by replacing
∆i by +∆i , we get a new symmetric multisegment a1 which has the same
relation type as a. Moreover, let b ∈ S(a) and b1 be the corresponding
multisegment in S(a1), then

m(b, a) = m(b1, a1)

by proposition 3.4.1. We note that the equality

m(b1, a1) = m(b′, a′)

69

implies that

m(b′, a′) = m(b, a).

Therefore it suﬃces to prove the theorem for a1 and a′. From now on, let
b(∆i) = b(∆i−1) + 1 and b(∆i) = b(∆′
i). The same argument shows that we
can furthermore assume that

e(∆w−1(i)) = e(∆w−1(i−1)) + 1,

e(∆′

w−1(i)) = e(∆′

w−1(i−1)) + 1.

Now if e(∆w−1(1)) < e(∆′
7→
a′(e(∆w−1 (1))+1,··· ,e(∆w−1(1))), the latter is a symmetric multisegment having the
same relation type as a′, and

w−1(1)), then consider the truncation functor a′

m(b′, a′) = m(b′(e(∆w−1 (1))+1,··· ,e(∆w−1(1))), a′(e(∆w−1 (1))+1,··· ,e(∆w−1(1))))

by proposition 4.1.5. Repeat the same procedure, in ﬁnite step, we ﬁnd c,
such that

and

a = a′(c)

m(b, a) = m(b′, a′).

by proposition 4.1.5.
Remark: an interesting application of this computation is given in the corol-
lary 4.4.7.
For general case, note that in section 4.4, we construct a symmetric multi-
segment asym and three multisegments ci, i = 1, 2, 3 such that

asym ∈ c2,c3S(asym)c1, a = (c2,c3)asym,(c1).

(cf. Corollary 4.2.3). The same for a′, we have

Lemma 4.4.6. The two multisegment asym and a′ sym have the same relation

we have the following commutative diagram

Admitting the lemma, we have

m(b, a) = m(bsym, asym), m(b′, a′) = m(b′ sym, a′ sym)

by proposition 4.2.4. Now by what we have proved before and the above
lemma, we have

m(bsym, asym) = m(b′ sym, a′ sym),

which implies m(b, a) = m(b′, a′).

Proof. Note that by construction we know that the number of segments in
asym is the same as that of a. Let asym = {∆1 (cid:22) · · · (cid:22) ∆r}, then a =
{(c2,c3)∆(c1)
r}. We
deﬁne

r }. Also let a′ sym = {∆′

1 (cid:22) · · · (cid:22) ∆′

ξsym :asym → a′ sym

∆i 7→ ∆′
i.

This automatically induces bijections

e(ξsym) : e(asym) → e(a′ sym),

b(ξsym) : b(asym) → b(a′ sym),

since all of them are sets. Note that we deﬁnitely have

ξ((c2,c3)∆(c1)

3)∆′(c′

It remains to show that ξsym preserve the relation type. Let i ≤ j. Then ∆i
and ∆j are linked if and only if one of the following happens

• (c2,c3)∆(c1)

i

and (c2,c3)∆(c1)

j

are linked, juxtaposed or not;

• (c2,c3)∆(c1)

i

and (c2,c3)∆(c1)

j

are unrelated.

j

covers (c2,c3)∆(c1)

And ∆j covers ∆i if and only if (c2,c3)∆(c1)
. Since ξ preserves
relation types, this shows that ξsym also preserves relation types. Hence we
conclude that asym and a′ sym have same relation type. To see that the map
Ξsym sends c2,c3S(asym)c1 to c′
, consider b ∈ S(a) and its related
element bsym ∈ c2,c3S(asym)c1.
- First of all, we assume that l(b) = 1, i.e. b can be obtained from a by
applying the elementary operation to the pair {(c2,c3)∆(c1)

We already showed the case where i = 0. Assume that we have

operation to the pair of segments {∆i−1,αi−1 (cid:22) ∆i−1,βi−1}. We deduce from

for j < i. Suppose that ebi is obtained from ebi−1 by applying the elementary
the fact ebi ≥ bsym that we are in one of the following situatios

- The general case where ℓ(b) > 1, we can choose a maximal chain of multi-
segments

By considering the set S(aℓ(b)−1), we are reduce to the case where ℓ(b) = 1.

Geometric Proof of KL
Relations

For n ≥ 1, recall that the permutation group Sn of {1, · · · , n} and that
S = {σi = (i, i+1) : i = 1, · · · , n−1} is a set of generators. It is followed from
[16] that the following properties characterize a unique family of polynomials
Px,y(q) of Z[q] for x, y ∈ Sn

(1) Px,x = 1 for all x ∈ Sn;

(2) if x < y and s ∈ S, are such that sy < y, sx > x, then Px,y = Psx,y;

(3) if x < y and s ∈ S, are such that ys < y, xs > x, then Px,y = Pxs,y;

(4) if x < y and s ∈ S, are such that sy < y, sx < x, and x is not comparable

to sy, then Px,y = Psx,sy;

(5) if x < y and s ∈ S, are such that sy < y, sx < x, and x < sy, then

Px,y = Psx,sy + qPx,sy − Xx≤z<sy,sz<z

q1/2(ℓ(y)−ℓ(z))µ(z, sy)Px,z,

here µ(z, sy) is the coeﬃcient of degree 1/2(ℓ(sy) − ℓ(z) − 1) in Pz,sy
deﬁned to be zero if ℓ(sy) − ℓ(z) is even).

In this chapter , we shall prove by using our results in section 3.3 that the

Remark: The condition Px,x = 1 is trivial.
The set up for through this chapter is the following. Assume that k, k1 ∈ N
such that 1 < k1 ≤ n, k = n + k1 − 1, and aId be a multisegment such that
we have an isomorphism

Note that we have n < k ≤ 2n − 1.

Φ : Sn → S(aId).

5.1 Relation (2) and (3)

Since the relation (2) and (3) are symmetric to each other, we only prove
(2). By [6] (1.26), the conditions

σk1−1w > w, σk1−1v < v.

are equivalent to

w−1(k1 − 1) < w−1(k1),

v−1(k1 − 1) > v−1(k1).

Proposition 5.1.1. Let a = Φ(w), c = Φ(v) ∈ S(a), such that

w−1(k1 − 1) < w−1(k1),

v−1(k1 − 1) > v−1(k1),

then

Proof. Suppose that

Pw,v(q) = Pσk1−1w,v(q).

Φ(Id) = {∆1 (cid:22) · · · (cid:22) ∆n}.

Let b = Φ(σk1−1w), then

[b(∆j), e(∆σk1−1w(j))]

[b(∆w−1σk1−1(j)), e(∆j)]

b =Xj

[b(∆w−1(j)), e(∆j)] + [b(∆w−1(k1−1)), e(∆k1)] + [b(∆w−1(k1)), e(∆k1−1)].

Note that

e(∆k1−1) = n + k1 − 2 = k − 1, e(∆k1) = n + k1 − 1 = k,

then b(k) = a(k). Now applying the corollary 3.3.19 gives the result.

78

5.2 Relation (4)

Let a = Φ(Id), ϕ = ϕa, As in section 3.3, we know that for ﬁxed W , by
proposition 3.3.16, we have an open immersion

τW : (X k

a )W → (Z k,a)W × Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W ).

Deﬁnition 5.2.1. By composing with the canonical projection

(Z k,a)W × Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W ) → (Z k,a)W ,

we have a morphism

φW : (X k

a )W → (Z k,a)W .

Proposition 5.2.2. For any b = Φ(w) ∈ S(a)k, we have

ψ−1
k (b(k)) = {b, b′ = Φ(σk1−1w)}.

Moreover, φW is a ﬁbration such that

(1) We have an isomorphism φ−1

W (Ob(k)) ≃ (C2 − {0}) × C2n−k−1.

(2) We have φ−1

W (Ob(k)) ∩ Ob′ ≃ C× × C2n−k−1.

Proof. Note that we have

ψ−1
k (b(k)) ⊆ S(b(k) + [k]),

we observe that

Since b is minimal in ψ−1

S(b(k) + [k]) ∩ S(a) = S(b′),
k (b(k)) (See Prop. 3.3.17), we have

ψ−1
k (b(k)) = {b, b′}.

Then consider the restricted morphism

φW : (Ob ∪ Ob′)W → Ob(k).

Let T ∈ Ob ∪ Ob′, T0 ∈ Hom(Vϕ,k−1, W ). Deﬁne T ′ ∈ Eϕ by

T ′|Vϕ,k−1 = T0 ⊕ T (k)|Vϕ,k−1,

T ′|Vϕ,k = T (k)|Vϕ,k/W ◦ pW ,

T ′|Vϕ,i = T (k), for i 6= k − 1, k.

79

We know that dim(W ) = ℓk = 1, and for dim(ker(T (k)|Vϕ,k−1)) = 2. Now let

∆1 < ∆2

be the two segments in b(k) which ends in k−1. And we consider the following
ﬂag

V0 = ker(T (k)|Vϕ,k−1) ⊇ V1 = Im(T (k))∆2 ∩ ker(T (k)|Vϕ,k−1).

And we have dim(V1) = 1. Then for T ′ ∈ Ob ∪ Ob′, it is necessary and
suﬃcient that

T0(V0) 6= 0.

This amounts to give a nonzero element in Hom(V0, W ) ≃ C2, which proves
that the ﬁber φ−1
W (T (k)) ≃ (C2−0)×C2n−k−1, where the factor C2n−k−1 comes
from the fact that dim(Vϕ,k−1) = 2n − (k − 1) = 2n − k + 1. As for T ′ ∈ Ob′,
it is necessary and suﬃcient that

T0(V1) = 0, T0(V0) 6= 0,

which amounts to give a zero element in Hom(V0/V1, W ) ≃ C. Hence
φ−1
W (T (k))∩Ob′ ≃ C× ×C2n−k−1. To see that φW is a ﬁbration, ﬁx V ⊆ Vϕ,k−1
such that dim(V ) = 2. Consider the sub-scheme of Z k

W given by

UV = {T ∈ Z k

W : ker(T |Vϕ,k−1) = V }.

Note that since dim(Vϕ,k−1) = dim(Vϕ,k/W )+2, the fact that dim(ker(T |Vϕ,k−1)) =
2 implies that UV is actually open in Z k

W . In this case

φ−1
W (UV ) = UV × (Hom(V, W ) − {0}) × Hom(Vϕ,k−1/V, W ).

Proposition 5.2.3. Let b = Φ(w), c = Φ(v) ∈ S(a), such that

w−1(k1 − 1) > w−1(k1),

v−1(k1 − 1) > v−1(k1), w < v,

and w is not comparable with σk1−1v, then

Pw,v(q) = Pσk1−1w,σk1−1v(q).

Remark: As before, our conditions are equivalent to

σk1−1w > w, σk1−1v > v.

80

Proof. Note that our assumption implies that both b and c are in S(a)k. Let
b′ = Φ(σk1−1w), c′ = Φ(σk1−1v). Then b′ > c′.
For b > d > c, we must have d = Φ(α) with σk1−1α < α. In fact, σk1−1α > α
would imply d > c′ by lifting property of Bruhat order (cf.
[6] proposition
2.2.7). Now that we have b > d > c′, contradicting to our assumption that
b is not comparable to c′. Let d′ = Φ(σk1−1α). Note that we create actually
by this way construct a morphism between the sets

ρ : {d : b ≥ d ≥ c} → {d′ : b′ ≥ d′ ≥ c′}

sending d to d′.

Lemma 5.2.4. The morphism ρ is a bijection.

Proof. Let e′ = Φ(β) ∈ S(b′) with e′ > c′. We show that σk1−1β > β. In
fact, assume that σk1−1β < β. Then the lifting property of Bruhat order
implies b > e′ > c′, which is a contradiction to the fact that b is not
comparable to c′. Hence we have e = Φ(σk1−1β) < e′. Moreover, since
σk1−1w < β < σk1−1v, and w > σk1−1w, v > σk1−1v, we have

w < σk1−1β < v,

hence b > e > c. This proves the surjectivity. The injectivity is clear from
the deﬁnition.

As a corollary, we have

Lemma 5.2.5. The restricted morphism

φW : X k

b′,c′ → Z k

b(k),c(k)(cf. Def. 3.3.6)

is a ﬁbration with ﬁbers isomorphic to C× × Cn−k.

Proof. Since φW is a composition of τW , which is an open immersion, and a
canonical projection, to show that it is a ﬁbration, it suﬃces to show that
all of its ﬁbers are isomorphic to C× × Cn−k. This follows from proposition
5.2.2 and the fact that for any d′ ∈ S(b′) we have d′ /∈ S(a)k.

Hence we get

Pb′,c′(q) = Pb(k),c(k)(q).
Now we are done by applying corollary 3.3.19, i.e,

Pb(k),c(k)(q) = Pb,c(q).

Hence we are done.

5.3 Relation (5)

Finally, we arrive at the relation (5). We will give an interpretation of this
relation in terms of the decomposition theorem (See [2]).

Deﬁnition 5.3.1. Let

ZW ={(T, z) ∈ Z k,a

W × Hom(V ∗

ϕ,k−1, W ∗) : and z

factors through the canonical projection V ∗

ϕ,k−1 → ker(T |Vϕ,k−1)∗}.

Proposition 5.3.2. The canonical projection ZW → Z k,a
vector bundle of rank 2 over Z k

W .

W turns ZW into a

Proof. Note that we have dim(ker(T |Vϕ,k−1)) = 2 and dim(W ) = 1. Note that
by taking dual, as a scheme, ZW is isomorphic to the scheme parametrize
the data (T, z) ∈ Z k
W × Vϕ,k−1 such that z ∈ ker(T |Vϕ,k−1). Fix V ⊆ Vϕ,k−1
such that dim(V ) = 2. Consider the sub-scheme of Z k

W given by

UV = {T ∈ Z k

W : ker(T |Vϕ,k−1) = V }.

As is showed in proposition 5.2.2, UV is actually open in Z k
previous interpretation of Zk
the projection ZW → Z k,a
W .

W . Using the
W , we observe that the open set UV trivializes

Deﬁnition 5.3.3. Let Z k
vector bundle ZW → Z k
κk
W : Z k

W → Z k
W .

W = P rojZ k,a

(ZW ) be the projectivization of the
W . And we shall denote the structure morphism by

W

Deﬁnition 5.3.4. From now on, we ﬁx a pair of non-degenerate bi-linear
forms

ζk−1 : Vϕ,k−1 × Vϕ,k−1 → C, ζk : Vϕ,k × Vϕ,k → C.

which allows us to have an identiﬁcation ηi : Vϕ,i ≃ V ∗

ϕ,i, for i = k − 1, k.

Remark: Here our deﬁnition X k
V ′
ϕ such that

a depends on the choice of Vϕ. If we choose

V ′
ϕ,i = Vϕ,i, for i 6= k − 1, k, V ′

ϕ,k−1 = V ∗

ϕ,k−1, V ′

ϕ,k = V ∗

we can get X k

a after we choose an isomorphism
ϕ,k ≃ Vϕ,k. This is what we do here. Note that once we
ϕ,k ≃ Vϕ,k. Our morphism ηi will become an inner

ϕ,k−1 ≃ Vϕ,k−1 and V ∗

82

Deﬁnition 5.3.5. Let T ∈ (X k

a )W , then we deﬁne

λ : (X k

a )W → (X k

a )ηk(W ),

by letting

and

λ(T )|Vϕ,k−2 = ηk−1 ◦ T |ϕ,k−2

λ(T )|Vϕ,k−1 = ηk ◦ T |ϕ,k−1 ◦ η−1
k−1,

λ(T )Vϕ,k = T |ϕ,k ◦ η−1
k ,

λ(T )Vϕ,i = T |ϕ,i, for i 6= k − 2, k − 1, k.

Lemma 5.3.6. We have ker(λ(T )|Vϕ,k) = ηk(W ), and

ker(λ(T )(k)|Vϕ,k−1) = ηk−1(ker(T |Vϕ,k−1)).

Proof. The fact ker(λ(T )|Vϕ,k) = ηk(W ) follows from deﬁnition. Note that

ker(T (k)|Vϕ,k−1) = {v ∈ Vϕ,k−1 : T (v) ∈ W } = T |−1

Vϕ,k−1

(W ).

Since

(λ(T )|Vϕ,k−1)−1(ηk(W )) = ηk−1(T |Vϕ,k−1)−1(W ) = ηk−1(ker(T |Vϕ,k−1)),

hence

ker(λ(T )(k)|Vϕ,k−1) = ηk−1(ker(T |Vϕ,k−1)).

Deﬁnition 5.3.7. We deﬁne

ξW : (X k

a )W → Z k

W ,

for T ∈ (X k

a )W , then

ξW (T ) = (T (k), λ(T )|ker(λ(T )(k)|Vϕ,k−1 )).

This is well deﬁned since

λ(T )|ker(λ(T )(k)|Vϕ,k−1 ) ∈ Hom(ker(λ(T )(k)|Vϕ,k−1), ηk(W )),

and

Hom(ker(λ(T )(k)|Vϕ,k−1), ηk(W )) ≃ Hom(ker(T (k)|Vϕ,k−1)∗, W ∗),

and λ(T )|ker(λ(T )(k)|Vϕ,k−1 ) 6= 0.

83

Proposition 5.3.8. The morphism ξW is a ﬁbration with ﬁbers isomorphic
to C× × Cn−k.

Proof. Let V ⊆ Vϕ,k−1 be a subspace such that dim(V ) = 2. Consider the
open sub-scheme of ZW

U1,V = {(T, z) ∈ ZW : z 6= 0, ker(T |Vϕ,k−1) = η−1

k−1(V )}.

UV = {T ∈ Z k

W , ker(T |Vϕ,k−1) = η−1

k−1(V )}.

Let eU1,V be the image of U1,V in Z k

W by the canonical projection. As indicated
in the proof of proposition 5.3.2, the set UV trivialize the morphism ZW →
Z k

W , hence

Note that we have

eU1,V ≃ UV × (Hom(V, ηk(W )) − {0}/C×)

Hom(V, ηk(W )) ≃ Hom(η−1

k−1(V ), W ).

And by proposition 3.3.16 and proposition 5.2.2, we have the following iso-
morphism

ξ−1

W (eU1,V ) ≃ UV × (Hom(η−1

Hence for any (T, z) ∈ Z k
open subset of (Hom(η−1

k−1(V ), W ) − 0) × Hom(Vϕ,k−1/η−1

k−1(V ), W ).

W such that ker(T |Vϕ,k−1) = η−1

k−1(V ) , let U2,V be an

k−1(V ), W ) − 0)/C which trivializes the bundle

(Hom(η−1

k−1(V ), W ) − 0) → (Hom(η−1

k−1(V ), W ) − 0)/C,

a neighborhood of (T, z).

then the open sub-scheme UV × U2,V of eUV,1 trivialize the morphism φW as
Deﬁnition 5.3.9. Let b > c be two elements in eS(a)k, then we deﬁne

Z k

b,c = ξW ((X k

b,c)W ).

And

Z k(b) = ξW ((Ob)W ).

Deﬁnition 5.3.10. Let w < v be two elements in Sn such that σk1−1v < v.
We deﬁne

R(w, v)k1 = {z : w ≤ z < σk1−1v, σk1−1z < z}.

And we denote R(Id, v)k1 by R(v)k1.

84

Now let b = Φ(w), c = Φ(v) such that

w(k1 − 1) > w(k1), v(k1 − 1) > v(k1).

And let b′ = Φ(σk1−1w), c′ = Φ(σk1−1v). We assume that

b > c, b > c′,

which coincide with the assumption in relation (5) at the beginning of this
chapter.
Now we apply the decomposition theorem to the projective morphism

κW : Z k

b′,c′ → Z k,a

b(k),c(k),W .

which asserts that there exists a ﬁnite collection of triples (di, Li, hi : i =
1, · · · , r), with d ∈ S(a)k, b(k) ≤ d(k)
i < c(k), where Li is a vector spaces
over C, such that

Now localize at a point xb(k) ∈ Ob(k), we have know that the Poincar´e series
of (IC(Z k,a

b(k),c(k),W ))xb(k) is given by Pb,c(q) = Pw,v(q). And

Lemma 5.3.12. The Poincar´e series of RΓ(κ−1
b′,c′)) is given
by Pσk1−1w,σk1−1v(q) + qPw,σk1−1v(q), where Γ is the functor of taking global
sections.

W (xb(k)), IC(Z k

Proof. Note that by assumption, we have

κ−1
W (xb(k)) ≃ P1

such that κ−1
And we have the following exact sequence

W (xb(k)) ∩ Z k(b′) = {pt} and κ−1

W (xb(k)) ∩ Z k(b) ≃ P1 − {pt}.

0 → IC(Z k

b′,c′)|pt → IC(Z k

b′,c′) → IC(Z k

b′,c′)|κ−1

W (xb(k) )−{pt} → 0.

Taking the Poincar´e series gives the result.

Now it is clear that our equation (5.3.11) will give rise to an equation of the
form as that in (5) in the introduction of this chapter. Comparing the two
equations, we get

Proposition 5.3.13. The collection of triples (di, Li, hi : i = 1, · · · , r) are
given by

85

(1) We have {di : i = 1, · · · , r} = {z ∈ R(w, v)k : µ(z, σk−1v) 6= 0}.

(2) If di = Φ(z), then Li ≃ Cµ(z,σk−1v).

(3) If di = Φ(z), then hi = ℓ(v) − ℓ(z).

Proof. Note that the Poincar´e series of the intersection complex IC(Z k,a
is

where di = Φ(zi). Now compare the polynomials given by 5.3.11 and the
relation (5) in the beginning of this chapter, we get our results.

Remark: Note that one should be able to deduce the above results from a
general statement about the decomposition theorem. We leave this for future
work.
Remark: It seems that we have done here may be generalized to give the
normality of for general Ob instead of using the results of Zelevinsky.

Chapter 6

Classiﬁcation of Poset S(a)

Let a be a multisegment and S(a) = {b ≤ a} the associated poset deﬁned
in 1.3.2. The aim of this chapter is to identify the poset structure of S(a).
In the ﬁrst section we consider the case where a is ordinary and prove that
S(a) is an interval in Sm ≃ B\GLm/B, where m is the number of segments
in a. and B is the Borel subgroup.
In the general case we identify S(a) with an interval in a parabolic quo-
tient SJ1\Sm/SJ2 of Sm given in section 2 related to the double quotient
PJ1\GLm/PJ2, where PJ1 and PJ2 are parabolic subgroups.

6.1 Ordinary Case

Our goal in this section is to prove that for general ordinary multisegment a,
the set S(a) is isomorphic to some Bruhat interval [x, y] for x, y ∈ Sn, where
n depends on a.

Lemma 6.1.1. Assume that b ∈ S(b)k such that b and b(k) are both ordi-
nary. Let c ∈ S(b)k. Then for d ∈ S(b) and d > c, we have d ∈ S(b)k.

Proof. It suﬃces to show that d satisﬁes the hypothesis Hk(b). Note that
e(d) = {e(∆) : ∆ ∈ d} is a set because d is ordinary and by lemma 2.1.4 we
have e(d) ⊆ e(b) .
Note that k − 1 /∈ e(b) since b ∈ S(b)k and b(k) is ordinary , therefore it is
not in e(d) either. Hence to show that d ∈ S(b)k hence it is equivalent to
show that k ∈ e(d). Since c ∈ S(d), we know that e(c) ⊆ e(d) . Now that
k ∈ e(c), we conclude that k ∈ e(d). We are done.

Now let b′ ∈ S(b)k such that ψk(b′) = (b(k))min, then

87

Lemma 6.1.2. We have

S(b)k = {c ∈ S(b) : c ≥ b′}.

Proof. By the lemma above, we know that S(b)k ⊇ {c ∈ S(b) : c ≥ b′}. We
conclude that we have equality since ψ preserve the order.

Proposition 6.1.3. Assume that a is ordinary. Then

(1) There exists a symmetric multisegment asym such that

S(a) ≃ S(asym)kr,··· ,k1.

(2) There exists an element a′ ∈ S(asym) such that

S(asym)kr,··· ,k1 = {c ∈ S(asym) : c ≥ a′}.

Proof. Note that (1) follows directly from proposition 4.2.2 and (2) follows
from applying successively lemma 6.1.2 to the sequence obtained in the
lemma below.

Lemma 6.1.4. There exists a sequence of multisegments a0 = a, · · · , ar =
asym such that asym is symmetric, with ai ∈ S(ai)ki and ai−1 = a(ki)
for some
ki. Moreover, ai is ordinary for all i = 1, · · · , r

i

Proof. Recall that in proposition 4.2.2 that every ordinary multisegment a
can be obtained as

a = a0, a1, · · · , ar,

where ar is symmetric, with ai ∈ S(ai)ki and ai−1 = a(ki)
The statement (1) follows directly from proposition 4.2.2. Note that the
ordinarity of ai’s follows from construction.

for some ki.

6.2 The parabolic KL polynomials

For ﬁxed n ∈ N and a pair of elements in Sn, we can associate a Kazhdan
Lusztig Polynomial Px,y(q). We know also that the coeﬃcients of such a
polynomial are given by the dimensions of the intersection cohomology of
corresponding Schubert varieties in GLn/B.
Similar construction can give rise to a polynomial related to the Poincar´e
series of the intersection cohomology of the Schubert varieties in GLn/P ,
where P is a standard parabolic subgroup. This has been done in Deodhar

88

[12] for general Coxeter System (W, S). However, as indicated in the same
article, in our case where G = GLn, this is not so interesting because we
have a good ﬁbration G/P → G/B, so basically everything boils down to
the Borel case.
In this section, for certain multisegment a, we shall relate the set S(a) to
the orbits in GLn/P , where the multiplicities appear to be the corresponding
Parabolic Kazhdan Lusztig Polynomials.

Notation 6.2.1. Let S = {σi : i = 1, · · · , n − 1} be a set of generators
for Sn. For J ⊆ S, let SJ =< J > be the subgroup generated by J and
SJ

n = {w ∈ Sn : ws > w for all s ∈ J}.

Proposition 6.2.2. (cf. [6] Prop. 2.4.4) We have

(1) Sn = aw∈SJ

n

wSJ;

(2) for w ∈ SJ

n , and x ∈ SJ , ℓ(wx) = ℓ(w) + ℓ(x) .

Remark: Now we can identify SJ
n with Sn/SJ , hence it is in bijection with
the Borel orbits in GLn/P , where P is the parabolic subgroup determined
by J.

Notation 6.2.3. Let aJ

Id = {∆1, · · · , ∆n} such that

e(∆1) < · · · < e(∆n),

b(∆1) ≤ · · · ≤ b(∆n),

and

such that

b(∆i) = b(∆i+1) if and only if σi ∈ J

and b(∆n) ≤ e(∆1).

Example 6.2.4. Let n = 4, and J = {σ1, σ3}, then we can choose

aJ
Id = [1, 3] + [1, 4] + [2, 5] + [2, 6].

parabolic type J.

Id as in example 6.2.4. For w = σ1σ2, then

aJ
w = [1, 4] + [1, 5] + [2, 3] + [2, 6].

Proof. We proceed by induction on |J|. If |J| = 0, we are in the symmetric
case, so we are done by Proposition 2.1.8. And in general, let J = J1 ∪ {σi0}
with i0 = min{i : σi ∈ J} and i1 = max{i : b(∆i) = b(∆i0)}.
Let a1 = {∆1

n}, such that

i =+ (∆i), for i ≤ i0,
i = ∆i, otherwise. ( cf. Nota. 3.1.1).

Example 6.2.8. Let aJ

Id be a multisegment as in example 6.2.4. Then

a1 = [0, 3] + [1, 4] + [2, 5] + [2, 6].

Let aJ1

Id = a1 with

i ) =(cid:26) b(∆i) − 1,

b(∆i),

b(∆1

for i ≤ i0,
for i > i0.

Then we have

Id = (b(∆1

))a1.

Let w1 = (i1, · · · , i0+1, i0), then w1 ∈ SJ1
since

n . Note that we have also ww1 ∈ SJ1
n ,

ww1(i) = w(i − 1) < ww1(i + 1) = w(i), for i = i0 + 1, · · · , i1 − 1.

Then by induction, we know that

aJ1

ww1 =Xi

[b(∆1

i ), e(∆1

ww1(i))] ∈ S(a1).

Example 6.2.9. Let aJ
J1 = {σ3}. In this case, we have w1 = σ1 and ww1 = σ1σ2σ1, with

Id as in the previous example. Then i1 = 2, and

aJ1

(1) For j = i0, we have

b(∆1

i0) = b(∆1

i0+1) − 1 = · · · = b(∆1

i1−1) − 1 = b(∆1

i1) − 1.

And ww1(i0) > ww1(i1) > ww1(i1 − 1) > · · · > ww1(i0 + 1), hence

e(∆1

ww1(i0)) > e(∆1

ww1(i1)) > e(∆1

ww1(i1−1)) > · · · > e(∆1

ww1(i0+1)),

because w ∈ SJ . This implies that bi0 satisﬁes the hypothesis (b(∆1

Lemma 6.2.11. Let J = {σi0} ∪ J1 such that i0 = min{i : σi ∈ J}. Let
i1 ∈ Z be the maximal integer satisfying for i0 ≤ i < i1 we have σi ∈ J. Then

with

SJ1
J = {wi : i = 1, · · · , i1 − i0 + 1}

As a consequence, we have

Proof. By proposition 6.2.2, we only need to show that SJ = aj

wjSJ1 and

wj ∈ SJ1. The fact that wj ∈ SJ1 follows from

wj(i) = i − 1, for i = i0 + 1, · · · , i1 − j + 1, wj(i0) = i1 − j + 1,

and wj(i) = i for i /∈ {i0, · · · , i1 − j + 1}. Finally, to see that SJ =aj

we compare the cadinalities. Let J0 = {σi : i = i0 · · · , i1 − 1}, then

wjSJ1,

SJ ≃ SJ0 × SJ\J0,

SJ1 ≃ SJ0\{σi0 ,i0+1} × SJ\J0.

Hence ♯SJ/♯SJ1 =

b(∆1

Proof. Again, we do this by induction on |J|.
If |J| = 0, we are in the
symmetric case, so everything is done in section 2.3. In general, we keep the

above,

we know that there exists a w′ ∈ SJ1, such that ΦJ1(w′) ∈ b(∆1

we get

ΦJ1(ww1) < ΦJ1(ww1),

ΦJ1(w) < ΦJ1(w),

since the morphism b(∆1

Proposition 6.2.15. Let v1, v2 ∈ SJ , then we have

PΦJ (v1),ΦJ (v2)(q) = P J

v1,v2(q)

where on the right hand side is the parabolic KL polynomial indexed by v1, v2.

Proof. As is proved in [12], we have P J
v1,v2(q) = Pv1vJ ,w2vJ (q), where vJ is
the maximal element in SJ . So it suﬃces to show that we have the equality
PΦJ (v1),ΦJ (v2)(q) = Pv1vJ ,v2vJ (q). Also, from lemma 6.2.10, we know that

ΦJ (v1) = b(∆1

where w1 is described in lemma 6.2.11. Hence we have

PΦJ1 (v1w1),ΦJ1 (v2w1)(q) = PΦJ (v1),ΦJ (v2)(q)

by corollary 3.3.18.
By induction, we have

PΦJ1 (v1w1),ΦJ1 (v2w1)(q) = Pv1w1vJ1 ,v1w1vJ1

(q).

Now to ﬁnish, we have to show vJ = w1vJ1. But we know that

SJ =aj

with w1 = max{wj : j = 1, · · · , i1 − i0 + 1}, we surely have

vJ = w1vJ1.

More generally, for Ji ⊆ S, i = 1, 2, we can consider the PJ1 orbit in GLn/PJ2.

Note that in this case, we have GLn/PJ is the Grassmanian Gk(Cn), where
as the PJ orbits correspond to the stratiﬁcation, for r ≤ r0 = min{k, n − k}
and ﬁxed Ck ∈ Gk(Cn),

Xr = {U ∈ Gk(Cn) : dim(U ∩ Ck) = k − r}

with Xr = ar′≤r

Xr′.

Remark: There is another way to obtain the result of this section , i.e., by
direct geometric construct, as in section 4.3, where we prove the same result
for symmetric case. In this situation, instead having the ﬂag variety G/B
in the ﬁbers, we will ﬁnd G/PJ in the ﬁbers. There is one advantage in this
geometric construction, i.e, by employing the same proof as in section 4.4,
one can get a resolution for G/PJ by pulling back that of the corresponding
orbit variety. This shows for example, that the resolution can not be small
when the associated quiver is of type An, n ≥ 3, by the example constructed
by Zelevinsky for ﬂag variety, which does not admit any small resolution.
We remark that the resolution is always small for type A2, as is proved by
Zelevinsky.
Remark: Note that in [30], Zelevinsky constructed a small resolution for the
Oa with a = {[1, 2], [2, 3]}, which corresponds to a Schubert varieties of 2-
step . Now with our interpretation, we should be able to construct a small
resolution for all 2-step Schubert varieties. We return to this question later.
Remark: With the help of partial derivative which we will develop in next
section, we will be able to give inverse parabolic KL polynomials combining
results of this section, which is described in [12] . See next section for more
details.

6.3 Non Ordinary Case

In this section, for a general multisegment a, we will relate the poset S(a)
to a Bruhat interval [x, y] with x < y in some SJ1,J2
Now let a be a multisegment. First of all, we decide the set J1, J2.

.

r

Deﬁnition 6.3.1. We deﬁne two sets J1(a), J2(a).

• Let b(a) = {k1 ≤ · · · ≤ kr}. Then let J2(a) ⊆ Sr be the set such that

σi ∈ J2(a) if and only if ki = ki+1.

• Let e(a) = {ℓ1 ≤ · · · ≤ ℓr}. Then let J1(a) ⊆ Sr be the set such that

σi ∈ J1(a) if and only if ℓi = ℓi+1.

Keeping the notations in deﬁnition 6.3.1,
Proposition 6.3.2. There exists a unique w ∈ SJ1(a),J2(a)

r

, such that

Proof. We observe that there exists an element w′ ∈ Sr, such that

a =Xj
a =Xj

[kj, ℓw(j)].

[kj, ℓw′(j)].

Now by proposition 6.2.18, we know that there exists w′ = wJ1(a)wwJ2(a) with
wJi(a) ∈ SJi(a) for i = 1, 2 and w ∈ SJ1(a),J2(a)
. Now we only need to prove
that

r

a =Xj

[kj, ℓw(j)].

In fact, by deﬁnition of Ji(a), i = 1, 2, we know that

Hence

kj = kv(j), for all v ∈ SJ2(a),
ℓj = ℓv(j), for all v ∈ SJ1(a).

Next we show how to reduce a general multisegment a to a multisegment
aJ1(a),J2(a)
of parabolic type (J1(a), J2(a)) without changing the poset struc-
w
ture S(a).

Proposition 6.3.3. Let a be a multisegment, then there exists a multiseg-
ment c, and a multisegment aJ1(a),J2(a)
of parabolic type (J1(a), J2(a)), such
that

w

aJ1(a),J2(a)
w

∈ S(aJ1(a),J2(a)

w

)c, a = (aJ1(a),J2(a)

w

)(c)

Proof. In general a is not of parabolic type, i.e, we do not have min{e(∆) :
∆ ∈ a} ≥ max{b(∆) : ∆ ∈ a}. Now we show how to construct aJ1(a),J2(a)
In fact, let

w

.

Then

a = {∆1, · · · , ∆n}, ∆1 ≺ · · · ≺ ∆n.

e(∆1) = min{k : i = 1, · · · , n}.

If a is not of parabolic type, let ∆1 = [e(∆1) + 1, ℓ] with ℓ maximal satisfying
that for any m such that e(∆1) ≤ m ≤ ℓ − 1, there is a segment in a ending
in m. We construct a1 by replacing every segment ∆ in a ending in ∆1 by
∆+. Repeat this construction with b1 to get a2 · · · , until we get as, which is
of parabolic type. Let c = {∆1, · · · , ∆s}, then we do as in proposition 4.2.1
to get

as ∈ S(as)c, a = (as)(c).

Note that by our construction we have

J1(ai) = J1(a), J2(ai) = J2(a),

for i = 1, · · · , s.

Lemma 6.3.4. Assume that a ∈ S(a)k such that

J1(a) = J1(a(k)), J2(a) = J2(a(k)).

Let c ∈ S(b)k. Then for d ∈ S(b) and d > c, we have d ∈ S(b)k.

Proof. It suﬃces to show that d satisﬁes the hypothesis Hk(a). Note that
e(d) ⊆ e(a) by lemma 2.1.4. Assume that k ∈ e(a) to avoid triviality. Now
that k − 1 /∈ e(a) since a ∈ S(a)k and

J1(a) = J1(a(k)), J2(a) = J2(a(k)),

so it is also not in e(d). Hence to show that d ∈ S(b)k hence it is equivalent
to show that ϕe(d)(k) = ee(a)(k). Since c ∈ S(d), we know that e(c) ⊆ e(d)
hence ϕe(d) ≤ ϕe(d)(k). Now that c ∈ S(a)k implies ϕe(c) = ϕe(a), we conclude
that ϕe(d)(k) = ee(a)(k). We are done.

98

Now let a′ ∈ S(a)k such that ψk(a′) = (a(k))min, then

Lemma 6.3.5. We have

S(a)k = {c ∈ S(a) : c ≥ a′}.

Proof. By the lemma above, we know that S(a)k ⊇ {c ∈ S(a) : c ≥ a′}. We
conclude that we have equality since ψ preserve the order.

Proposition 6.3.6. Assume that a is a multisegment. Then

(1) There exists a multisegment aJ1(a),J2(a)

w

of parabolic type (J1(a), J2(a))

and a sequence of integers k1, · · · , kr such that

S(a) ≃ S(aJ1(a),J2(a)

w

)kr,··· ,k1.

(2) There exists an element a′ ∈ S(aJ1(a),J2(a)

w

) such that

S(aJ1(a),J2(a)

w

)kr,··· ,k1 = {c ∈ S(aJ1(a),J2(a)

w

) : c ≥ a′}.

Proof. Note that (1) follows from proposition 6.3.3 and proposition 4.1.5.
And (2) follows from applying the lemma 6.3.5 successively to the lemma
below.

Lemma 6.3.7. There exists a sequence of multisegments a0 = a, · · · , ar =
aJ1(a),J2(a)
is of parabolic type (J1(a), J2(a)), ai ∈ S(ai)ki
w
and ai−1 = a(ki)

for some ki. Moreover,

i

such that aJ1(a),J2(a)

w

J1(ai) = J1(a), J2(a) = J2(a)

for all i = 1, · · · , r.

Proof. This follows from our construction in the proof of proposition 6.3.3.

Chapter 7

Computation of Partial
Derivatives

In this chapter, we study the problem of computing the partial derivatives
D k(La) of the irreducible representation La attached to a multisegment a.
The idea is to use these computations to calculate the multiplicities in the
induced representation La × Lb, cf. the next chapter. Recall that we have
already given a way of computing La as a sum, cf. (1.3.7)

La =Xb emb,aπ(a).

So one is reduced to the calculate

D k(π(a)) =Xb

nb,aLb,

nb,a ≥ 0.

As for the coeﬃcient mb,a, we ﬁrst introduce a new poset structure (cid:22)k on
the set of multisegments so that we have the equivalence between nb,a > 0
and b (cid:22)k a, cf. proposition 7.1.4.
The principal result of this chapter is the interpretation of the coeﬃcient nb,a
as the value at q = 1 of some Poincar´e series of the Lusztig product of two
explicit perverse sheaves on orbital varieties, cf. proposition 7.3.8.
In 7.4, we compute these Lusztig products as the push forward by a projection
β′′, cf. corollary 7.4.19, of some concrete perverse sheaf on an orbital variety.
In §7.6 we ﬁrst study the geometry of the case where the multisegments are
of Grassmanian type. In this case the projection β′′ is simply cf. proposition
7.6.8, the natural projection

GLn/P → GLn/P ′

101

with P ⊆ P ′ two parabolic subgroups. The geometry of the parabolic case is
treated in §7.7: the constructions and proofs are the same as the Grassmanian
type.
Finally in the last section 7.8, we obtain a complete formula for D k(La) in
the general case, cf. corollary 7.8.16

7.1 New Poset Structure on Multisegments

In this section we deﬁne a new poset structure (cid:22)k depending on an integer k
on the set of multisegments and show that the term Lb appears in D k(π(a))
if and only if b (cid:22)k a.

Deﬁnition 7.1.1. For a well ordered multisegment a = {∆1, · · · , ∆s} with
∆1 (cid:22) · · · (cid:22) ∆s, let

a(k) := {∆ ∈ a : e(∆) = k} = {∆i0, ∆i0+1, · · · , ∆i1}.

Now let Γ ⊆ a(k), let

a(k)Γ := (a(k) \ Γ) ∪ {∆(k) : ∆ ∈ Γ},

and

aΓ := (a \ a(k)) ∪ a(k)Γ.

We say b (cid:22)k a if there exist a multisegment c ∈ S(a) such that

b ≤ aΓ

for some Γ.

Lemma 7.1.2. We have

D k(π(a)) = π(a) + XΓ⊆a(k),Γ6=∅

π(aΓ).

(7.1.3)

Proof. Let

Then

a = {∆1, · · · , ∆r, ∆r+1, · · · , }.

π(a) =

rYi=1

L∆i ×Yi>r

L∆i

102

and

D k(π(a)) =

) ×Yi>r

i

(L∆i + L∆(k)

rYi=1
= π(a) + XΓ⊆a(k),Γ6=∅

L∆i

π(aΓ).

Proposition 7.1.4. Let

D k(π(a)) =Xb

nb,aLb.

(7.1.5)

Then nb,a > 0 if and only if b (cid:22)k a.

Proof. Let b (cid:22) a, then by deﬁnition we have b ≤ aΓ for some Γ. Therefore
mb,aΓ > 0, now we have nb,a > 0 by equation 7.1.3. Conversely, if nb,a > 0,
then by equation 7.1.3, we know that b ≤ aΓ for some Γ.

Corollary 7.1.6. We have b (cid:22)k a if and only if D k(π(a)) − π(b) ≥ 0 in R.

Proof. We keep the notations in the proof of proposition 7.1.4. We know
that b (cid:22)k a implies b ≤ aΓ for some Γ ⊆ a(k). By lemma 1.3.5, we know
that b ≤ aΓ implies that π(aΓ) − π(b) ≥ 0 in R. Since D k(π(a)) − π(aΓ) ≥ 0
by equation (7.1.3), we have D k(π(a)) − π(b) ≥ 0. Conversely, if D k(π(a)) −
π(b) ≥ 0, we have n(b, a) > 0, hence b (cid:22)k a by proposition 7.1.4.

Proposition 7.1.7. For any b (cid:22)k a, there exists c ∈ S(a), and some subset
Γ ⊆ c(k), such that

Conversely, if b = cΓ for some c ∈ S(a), then b (cid:22)k a.

b = cΓ.

Proof. For the converse part, suppose c 6= a, by equation 7.1.3, we have
D k(π(c)) − π(b) ≥ 0 in R. By lemme 1.3.5, we know that π(a) − π(c) ≥ 0
in R, hence D k(π(a)) − D k(π(c)) ≥ 0 by theorem 1.4.4. Therefore nb,a > 0.
Hence we have b (cid:22)k a.
For the direct part, suppose that b (cid:22)k a, hence b < aΓ1 for some Γ1. We
prove by induction on ℓ(b, aT ). If ℓ(b, aΓ1) = 0, then b = aΓ1, we are done.
Now let b < d ≤ aΓ1 such that ℓ(b, d) = 1, by induction, we know that

d = c′

Γ0,

103

for some c′ ∈ S(a). Note that by replacing c′ by a, we can assume that
d = aΓ1 and ℓ(b, aΓ1) = 1.
By deﬁnition, we know that b is obtained by applying the elementary oper-
ation to a pair of segments {∆ (cid:22) ∆′} in aT . Now we set out to construct
c.

• If {∆, ∆′} ⊆ a \ {∆(k) : ∆ ∈ Γ1} ⊆ a, let c be the multisegment
obtained by applying the elementary operations to {∆, ∆′}. And we
have

b = cΓ1.

• If {∆, ∆′} ∩ {∆(k) : ∆ ∈ Γ1} = {∆′}, then {∆, ∆′+} ∈ a let c be
the multisegment obtained by applying the elementary operations to
{∆, ∆′+}. Then let

Γ = (Γ1 \ {∆′+}) ∪ {∆ ∪ ∆′+}

and we have

b = cΓ.

• If {∆, ∆′} ∩ {∆(k) : ∆ ∈ Γ1} = {∆}, then {∆+, ∆′} ∈ a let c be
the multisegment obtained by applying the elementary operations to
{∆+, ∆′}. Then let

Γ = (Γ1 \ {∆+}) ∪ {∆ ∩ ∆′}

b = cΓ.

and we have

Hence we are done.

Proposition 7.1.8. The relation (cid:22)k deﬁnes a poset structure on O.

Proof. By deﬁnition we have a (cid:22)k a for any a ∈ O. Suppose a1 (cid:22)k a2, a2 (cid:22)k
a3, we want to show that a1 (cid:22)k a3. By proposition 7.1.7, there exists c ∈
S(a2) and Γ1 ⊆ c(k) , such that

a1 = cΓ1.

Note that by corollary 7.1.6, the fact a2 (cid:22)k a3 implies D k(π(a3))−π(a2) ≥ 0.
Hence we have n(a3, c) > 0, therefore c (cid:22)k a3 by proposition 7.1.4. In turn,

104

we know that there exists a multisegment c′ ∈ S(a3) and Γ2 ⊆ c′(k), such
that

Since we have c(k) ⊆ c′(k), we take

c = c′

Γ2.

Now we get

Γ3 := Γ1 ∪ Γ2 ⊆ c′(k).

a1 = c′

Γ3,

which implies a1 (cid:22)k a3 by proposition 7.1.7. Finally, if a (cid:22)k b and b (cid:22)k a,
then by deﬁnition we have a = b.

Deﬁnition 7.1.9. We let

Γ(a, k) = {b : b (cid:22)k a}.

7.2 Canonical Basis and Quantum Algebras

In this section, following [21], we recall the results of Lusztig on canonical
basis, the relation of quantum algebras and the algebra R. We are especially
interested in the construction of a product of perverse sheaves over orbital va-
rieties deﬁned by Lusztig [23], which is closely related to the product deﬁned
by induction in R.
Deﬁnition 7.2.1. Let N(Z) be the semi-group of sequences (dj)j∈Z of non
negative integers which are zero for all but ﬁnitely many j. Let αi be the
element whose i-th term is 1 and other terms are zero.
Deﬁnition 7.2.2. We deﬁne a symmetric bilinear form on N(Z) given by

(αi, αj) =


2,
−1,
0,

for i = j;

for |i − j| = 1;

otherwise .

Deﬁnition 7.2.3. Let q be an indeterminate and Q(q1/2) be the fractional
ﬁeld of Z[q1/2]. Let U ≥0
be the Q(q1/2)-algebra generated by the elements Ei
and K ±1

q

i

for i ∈ Z with the following relations:
KiKj = KjKi, KiK −1

i = 1;
KiEi = q1/2(αi,αj)EiKi;

E2

i Ej − (q1/2 + q−1/2)EiEjEi + EjE2

EiEj = EjEi, if |i − j| > 1;
i = 0, if |i − j| = 1.

and let U + be the subalgebra generated by the Ei’s.

105

Remark: This is the + part of the quantized enveloping algebra U associated
by Drinfeld and Jimbo to the root system A∞ of SL∞. And for q = 1, this
specializes to the classical enveloping algebra of the nilpotent radical of a
Borel subalgebra.

Deﬁnition 7.2.4. We deﬁne a new order on the set of segments Σ

(cid:26)

[j, k] ⊳ [m, n], if k < n,

[j, k] ⊲ [m, n], if j < m, n = k.

We also denote [j, k] ⊳ [m, n] or [j, k] = [m, n] by E[m, n].

Lemma 7.2.5. The algebra U +

αi. Moreover, for a given weight α, the homogeneous component of U +
q with
weight α is of ﬁnite dimension, and its basis are naturally parametrized by
the multisegments of the same weight.

is N(Z)-graded via the weight function wt(Ei) =

Proof. Let a =

mis,js[is, js] be a multisegment of weight α, note that here

rXs=1

we identify the weight ϕi with αi, and that

[i1, j1] E · · · E [ir, jr]( cf. Def. 7.2.4)

Then we associate to a the element

(Ej1 · · · Ei1) · · · (Ejr · · · Eir ).

Notation 7.2.6. For x ∈ U + be an element of degree α, we will denote
wt(x) = α.

Example 7.2.7. For i ≤ j, let αij = αi+· · ·+αj. Consider the homogeneous
components of U + with weight α = 2α12, whose basis is given by

E1E2E1E2, E1E1E2E2.

The element E1E2E1E2 is parametrized by the multisegment [1] + [1, 2] + [2],
while E1E1E2E2 is parametrized by the multisegment 2[1] + 2[2].

In [23], Lusztig has deﬁned certain bases for U +
q associated to the orienta-
tions of a Dynkin diagram, called PBW( Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt) basis, which
specializes to the classical PBW type bases. Following [21], we describe the

Deﬁnition 7.2.8. We deﬁne

E([i]) = Ei, E([i, j]) = [Ej[· · · [Ei+1, Ei]q1/2 · · · ]q1/2]q1/2,

where [x, y]q1/2 = xy−q−1/2(wt(x),wt(y))yx. More generally, let a =Xs

be a multisegment, such that

ais,js[is, js]

Deﬁnition 7.2.9. Let x 7→ x be the involution deﬁned as the unique ring
automorphism of U +

q deﬁned by

q1/2 = q−1/2, Ei = Ei.

Proposition 7.2.10. (cf. [23]) Let L :=Ma∈O

exists a unique Q(q1/2)-basis {G(a) : a ∈ O} of U +

q such that

Z[q1/2]E(a) ⊆ U +

q . Then there

G(a) = G(a), G(a) = E(a) modulo q1/2L.

This is called Lusztig’s canonical basis.

Lusztig also gave a geometric description of his canonical basis in terms of
the orbital varieties Oa.

Deﬁnition 7.2.11. Let A be the group ring of Q∗
ℓ over Z. Let Kϕ be the
Grothendieck group over A of the category of constructible, Gϕ-equivariant
Qℓ sheaves over Eϕ, considered as a variety over a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq.

Lemma 7.2.12. (cf. [23]) The A-module Kϕ admits a basis {γa : a ∈ S(ϕ)}
indexed by the Gϕ orbits of Eϕ, where γa corresponds to the constant sheaf
Qℓ on the orbit Oa, extending by 0 to the complement.

E′ :={(T, W, µ, µ′) : (T, W ) ∈ E′′, µ : W ≃ Vϕ2, µ′ : Vϕ/W ≃ Vϕ1},

and

β′′((T, W )) = W, β′((T, W, µ, µ′)) = (T, W ), β((T, W, µ, µ′)) = (T1, T2),

such that

T1 = µ′ ◦ T ◦ µ′−1, T2 = µ ◦ T ◦ µ−1.

Proposition 7.2.15. (cf. [23]) The group Gϕ × Gϕ1 × Gϕ2 acts naturally on
the varieties in the diagram (7.2.14) with Gϕ acting trivially on Eϕ1 × Eϕ2
and Gϕ1 × Gϕ2 acting trivially on Eϕ. And all the maps there are compatible
with such actions. Moreover, we have

(1) The morphism β′ is a principle Gϕ1 × Gϕ2-ﬁbration.

(2) The morphism β is a locally trivial trivial ﬁbration with smooth connected

ﬁbers.

(3) The morphism β′′ is proper.

Example 7.2.16. Let ϕ1 = χ1, ϕ2 = χ2. Then ϕ = χ1 + χ2 and

Eϕ1 = Eϕ2 = 0, Eϕ = Fq.

Moreover, we have

E′′ = {(T, W ) : W = Vϕ2, T ∈ Fq} ≃ Fq,

and

E′ = {(T, W, µ, µ′) : (T, W ) ∈ E′′, µ, µ′ ∈ F×

Hence if we let

then

IC(Oa) = Qℓ, IC(Oa′) = Qℓ.

P = Qℓ,

β∗(IC(Oa) ⊗ IC(Oa′)) = β′′∗(P).

Deﬁnition 7.2.19. We deﬁne a multiplication

IC(Oa) ⋆ IC(Oa′) = β′′

∗ (P).

Example 7.2.20. As in the example 7.2.16, we have

IC(Oa) ⋆ IC(Oa′) = β′′

∗ (P) = IC(Eϕ),

note that here β′′ is an isomorphism.

Proposition 7.2.21. (cf. [23]) Let a ∈ O(ϕ1), a′ ∈ O(ϕ2). We associate to
the intersection cohomology complex IC(Oa)

eγa =Xb≥a

pb,a(q)γb,

where pb,a(q) is the formal alternative sum of eigenvalues of the Frobenius
map on the stalks of the cohomology sheaves of IC(Oa) at any Fq rational
point of Ob. Moreover, the multiplication ⋆ gives a A-bilinear map

Kϕ1 × Kϕ2 → Kϕ,

which deﬁnes an associative algebra structure over K =Mϕ

Kϕ.

To relate the algebra K and U ≥0

Proposition 7.2.22. ([23] Prop. 9.8, Thm. 9.13)

• The elements γi := γ[i] for all i ∈ Z generate the algebra K over A.

• Let U ≥0

A = U ≥0

q ⊗Z A. Then we have a unique A-algebra morphism

Γ : K → U ≥0

A such that

for all j ∈ Z. Moreover, for ϕ ∈ S, let

S(ϕ) =Xi∈Z

(ϕ(i) − 1)ϕ(i)/2 −Xi∈Z

ϕ(i)ϕ(i + 1).

Then there is an A-linear map Θ : Kϕ → U +

A, such that

Γ(ξ) = q1/2S(ϕ)K(ϕ)Θ(ξ),

where K(ϕ) =Yi∈Z

iϕc(i − 1)ϕc(i),

and δc is the co-dimension of the orbit Oc in Eϕc.

• We have

Hence

Θ(γa) = q1/2 dim(Oa)E(a), Θ(eγa) = q1/2 dim(Oa)G(a).

G(a) =Xb≥a

Pb,a(q)E(b).

Proposition 7.2.23. The canonical basis of U +
q are almost orthogonal with
respect to a scalar product introduced by Kashiwara [15], which are given by

(E(a), E(b)) =

(1 − q)deg(a)

symbol([22]). And we have

(G(a), G(b)) = δa,b mod q1/2A.

Notation 7.2.24. We denote by {E∗(a)} and {G∗(a)} the dual basis of
{E(a)} and {G(a)} with respect to the Kashiwara scalar product.

Example 7.2.26. Let a = [1] + [2]. Then

and

E∗(a) = E([1])E([2]) = E(a),

G∗([1, 2]) = E∗([1, 2]),

G∗(a) = E∗(a) − q1/2E∗([1, 2]).

Finally, we establish the relation of between the algebras R and U +.

Deﬁnition 7.2.27. Let B be the polynomial algebra generated by the set of
coordinate functions {tij : i < j}. Following [21], we write tii = 1, tij = 0 if
i > j, and indexed the non-trivial ti,j’s by segments, namely, t[ij] = ti,j−1 for
i < j.

Now by corollary 1.2.3, we have the following

Proposition 7.2.28. We have an algebra isomorphism φ : B ≃ R by iden-
tifying t[ij] with L[ij] for all i < j.

Deﬁnition 7.2.29. Let Bq be the quantum analogue of B generate by {Tij :
i < j}, where Tij is considered as the q-analogue of tij. Also, we write Tii = 1
and Tij = 0 if i > j. And we will indexed the non-trivial Tij by T[i,j−1]. The

generators Ts’s satisﬁes the following relations (cf.
segments. Then

Ts′Ts =(cid:26) q−1/2(wt(s′),wt(s))TsTs′ + (q−1/2 − q1/2)Ts∩s′Ts∪s′,

q−1/2(wt(s′),wt(s))TsTs′, otherwise .

if s and s′ are linked,

111

Proposition 7.2.30. (cf. [21] Section 3.5) There exist an algebra isomor-
phic morphism

given by ι(E∗([i, j])) = T[i,j]. Moreover, for a =Xi≤j

ι : U +

aij[i, j], we have

here the multiplication is taken with respect to the order <.

Example 7.2.31. Let a = [1] + [2], then

ι(E∗(a)) = T[1]T[2].

Proposition 7.2.32. By specializing at q = 1, the dual canonical basis
{G∗(a) : a ∈ O} gives rise to a well deﬁned basis for B, denoted by {g∗(a) :
a ∈ O}. Moreover, the morphism φ sends g∗(a) to La for all a ∈ O. 1

7.3 Partial Derivatives and Poincar´e’s series

In this section we will deduce a geometric description for the partial deriva-
tives, using results of last section.

Deﬁnition 7.3.1. Kashiwara [15] introduced some q-derivations E′
for all i ∈ Z satisfying

i in End(U +
q )

E′

i(Ej) = δij, E′

i(uv) = E′

i(u)v + q−1/2(αi,wt(u))uE′

i(v).

Example 7.3.2. Simple calculation shows that

E′

i(E([j, k])) = δi,k(1 − q)E([j, k − 1]),

by taking dual, we get

E′

i(E∗([j, k])) = δi,kE∗([j, k − 1]),

1 It is surprising that an isomorphism in the commutative world is governed by a
non-commutative one, such phenomenon also happens in the theory of periods, where
a period be a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are values of absolutely
convergent integrals of rational functions with rational coeﬃcients, over domains in Rn
given by polynomial inequalities with rational coeﬃcients, then there is a conjecture saying
that two rational functions give the same period if and only if they can be transformed to
each other according to three simple rules, see [18] chapter 1.

112

Proposition 7.3.3. We have

(E′

i(u), v) = (u, Eiv),

where (, ) is the scalar product introduced in proposition 7.2.28.

Note that by identifying the algebra U +

Then the morphism Di : B → B is an algebraic morphism. Moreover, if we
identify the algebras R and B via φ, then the morphism Di coincides with
the partial derivative D i.

Proof. For n ∈ N, we have

(cid:18)n

i (u)e′s

i (v) = Di(u)Di(v).

Finally, to show that Di and D i coincides, it suﬃces to prove that

but we have

and

Therefore, we have

φ ◦ Di(t[j,k]) = D i ◦ φ(t[j,k]),

Di(t[j,k] = t[j,k] + δi,kt[j,k−1],

D i(L[j,k]) = Lj,k + δi,kL[j,k−1].

φ ◦ Di(t[j,k]) = D i ◦ φ(t[j,k]).

113

Remark: Without specializing at q = 1, the operator Di is not an algebraic
morphism. To get an algebraic morphism at the level of U +
q , one should
consider not only the summation of the iteration of e′
i’s but all the derivations,
which gives rise to an embedding into the quantum shuﬄe algebras, cf. [20].
Next we show how to determine D i(La) by the algebra K of Lusztig.

Lemma 7.3.6. Let n ∈ N, and d ∈ O. Then we have

(En

where (, ) is the Kashiwara scalar product. Moreover, for each b such that
(G(b), E′n

i E∗(d)) 6= 0, we have

wt(d) = wt(b) + nαi.

Proof. This is by deﬁnition.

Corollary 7.3.7. Let b (cid:22)k d such that wt(d) = wt(b) + nαi. Then Lb

appears as a factor of

Proposition 7.3.8. Let b (cid:22)k a, then there exists c ∈ S(a) such that c =
b + ℓ[k]. Then

nb,a =Xi

dim H2i(IC(Oℓ[k]) ⋆ IC(Ob))a.

Proof. Note that by proposition 7.2.22, we have

Γ(eγℓ[k] ⋆eγb) = Γ(eγℓ[k])Γ(eγb)

= q1/2(S(ϕℓ[k])+S(ϕb))K(ϕℓ[k])K(ϕb)Θ(eγℓ[k])Θ(eγb)

= q1/2(S(ϕℓ[k])+S(ϕb))K(ϕℓ[k] + ϕb)q1/2(dim(Oℓ[k])+dim(Ob))G(ℓ[k])G(b).

Since we have

S(ϕℓ[k]) = dim(Oℓ[k]) = 0, G(ℓ[k]) = E(ℓ[k]) =

1

[ℓ]q1/2!

Eℓ

k, ϕℓ[k] + ϕb = ϕa,

= q1/2(S(ϕd)+dim(Od))K(ϕd)E(d).

Now write

Applying Γ gives

Hence

pd,b(q)q1/2(S(ϕd)+dim(Od)−S(ϕb)−dim(Ob))E(d),

now compare with lemma 7.3.6, we get

(G(b), E′n

i E∗(d)) = [ℓ]q1/2!pd,b(q)q1/2(S(ϕd)+dim(Od)−S(ϕb)−dim(Ob)).

Finally, we write

by applying the scalar product, we get

E′n

i E∗(d)) = pd,b(q)q1/2(S(ϕd)+dim(Od)−S(ϕb)−dim(Ob)).

Hence, by specializing at q = 1, we have

nb,d = pd,b(1).

Now take d = a, we get the formula in our proposition.

7.4 A formula for Lusztig’s product

In this section we will ﬁnd a geometric way to calculate Lusztig’s product
in special case, which allows us to determine the partial derivatives in the
following sections.

Deﬁnition 7.4.1. Let k ∈ Z. We say that a satisﬁes the assumption (Ak)
if it satisﬁes the following conditions 2

(1) We have

max{b(∆) : ∆ ∈ a} + 1 < min{e(∆) : ∆ ∈ a}.

(2) Moreover, we have ϕe(a)(k) 6= 0 and ϕe(a)(k + 1) = 0.

Lemma 7.4.2. Let a be a multisegment satisfying the assumption (Ak).
Then a is of parabolic type. Moreover, The set S(ϕa) contains a unique
maximal element satisfying the assumption (Ak), denoted by aId.

Proof. Let b(a) = {k1 ≤ · · · ≤ kr}, e(a) = {ℓ1 ≤ · · · ≤ ℓr}.
Then by proposition 6.3.2, we know that there exists an element w ∈ SJ1(a),J2(a)
such that

r

,

Let

a =Xj
aId =Xj

[kj, ℓw(j)].

[kj, ℓj],

now by proposition 6.2.24, we know that a ≤ aId. Finally, aId depends only
on b(a) and e(a), not on a, which shows that aId is the maximal element in
S(ϕa) satisfying the assumption (Ak).

Lemma 7.4.3. Suppose that a is a multisegment satisfying the hypothesis
(Ak), then

(1) eS(a)k = S(a);

(2) we have

X k

a = Ya = ac∈S(a)

Oc.

2Since here we only work with the partial derivative D k with k ∈ Z, for every multi-
segment, we can always use the reduction method to increase the length of segments from
the left, so that at some point we arrive at the situation of our assumption (Ak), therefore
we do not lose the generality.

116

Proof. Note that by assumption

max{b(∆) : ∆ ∈ a} < min{e(∆) : ∆ ∈ a}.

This ensures that for any c ∈ S(a), we have ϕe(c)(k) = ϕe(a)(k), hence by

deﬁnition c ∈ eS(a)k. This proves (1), and (2) follows from (1).

Lemma 7.4.4. Let a be a multisegment satisfying the assumption (Ak) and
a = aId. Let ℓ ∈ N such that ℓ ≤ ϕe(a)(k) and ϕ ∈ S such that

ϕ + ℓχ[k] = ϕa.

Then for b ∈ S(ϕ), we have b (cid:22)k a if and only if b(k) ≤ a(k) and ϕe(b)(k −
1) = ℓ + ϕe(a)(k − 1).

Proof. Let b ∈ S(ϕ) such that b (cid:22)k a, then by proposition 7.1.7, we know
that b = cΓ for some c ∈ S(a) and Γ ⊆ c(k). Therefore

b(k) = c(k) ≤ a(k)

by the lemma above. And by deﬁnition of cΓ, we know that

ϕe(b)(k − 1) = ℓ + ϕe(c)(k − 1).

Now applying the fact that a satisﬁes the assumption (Ak), we deduce that

ϕe(c)(k − 1) = ϕe(a)(k − 1).

let b ∈ S(ϕ) be a multisegment such that b(k) ≤ a(k) and

Conversely,
ϕe(b)(k − 1) = ℓ + ϕe(a)(k − 1).
We deduce from b(k) ≤ a(k) that

from which we obtain

b ≤ a(k) + ϕe(b)(k)[k],

ϕb = ϕa(k) + ϕe(b)(k)χ[k].

By assumption, we know that

Combining with the formula

ϕb + ℓχ[k] = ϕa.

ϕa = ϕa(k) + ϕe(a)(k)χ[k],

117

we have

ϕe(a)(k) = ϕe(b)(k) + ℓ.

Now that for any ∆ ∈ a, if e(∆) = k, then b(a) ≤ k − 1. Therefore we have

ϕe(a(k))(k − 1) = ϕe(a)(k − 1) + ϕe(a)(k).

Applying the formula ϕe(b)(k − 1) = ℓ + ϕe(a)(k − 1), ϕe(b(k))(k − 1) =
ϕe(a(k))(k − 1), we get

ϕe(b(k))(k − 1) = ϕe(b)(k − 1) + ϕe(b)(k).

Such a formula implies that for ∆ ∈ b, if e(∆) = k, then b(∆) ≤ k − 1.
Let b(a) = {k1 ≤ · · · ≤ kr}, e(a) = {ℓ1 ≤ · · · ≤ ℓr}. The assumption that
a = aId implies that

a =Xi

[ki, ℓi]

Suppose that

a(k) = {[ki, ℓi] : i0 ≤ i ≤ i1}.

Take Γ = {[ki, ℓi] : i0 + ℓ ≤ i ≤ i1} and

a′ = aΓ.

Then a′ (cid:22)k a. Note that a′ is a multisegment of parabolic type which
corresponds to the identify in some symmetric group, cf. notation 6.2.21.
Finally, proposition 6.2.24 implies that b ∈ S(a′).

Lemma 7.4.5. Assume that a is a multisegment satisfying (Ak). Let r ≤
ϕe(a)(k) and d = a + r[k + 1]. Then we have X k+1
d = Yd and for a ﬁxed
subspace W of Vϕd,k+1 of dimension r, the open immersion

τW : (X k+1

d

)W → (Z k+1,d)W × Hom(Vϕd,k, W )

is an isomorphism.

Proof. Note that our assumption on a ensures that X k+1

d = Yd since we have

dmin ∈ eS(d)k+1. It suﬃces to show that τW is surjective. Let (T (k), T0) ∈

(Z k+1,d)W × Hom(Vϕd,k, W ), by ﬁxing a splitting Vϕd,k+1 = W ⊕ Vϕd,k+1/W ,
we deﬁne

T ′|Vϕd,k = T0 ⊕ T (k+1)|Vϕd,k,

T ′|Vϕd,k+1 = T (k+1)|Vϕd,k+1/W ◦ pW ,

118

T ′|Vϕd,i = T (k+1), for i 6= k, k + 1,

where pw : Vϕd → Vϕd,k/W is the canonical projection. Then we have T ′ ∈ Yd
hence T ′ ∈ (X k+1
)W . Now since by construction we have τW (T ′) = (T (k), T0),
we are done.

d

Deﬁnition 7.4.6. Assume that a is a multisegment satisfying (Ak) and d =
a + r[k + 1] for some r ≤ ϕe(a)(k). Let Xd be the open sub-variety of X k+1
consisting of those orbits Oc with c ∈ S(d), such that ϕe(c)(k) + r = ϕe(a)(k).

d

Deﬁnition 7.4.7. Let V be a vector space and ℓ1 < ℓ2 < dim(V ) be two
integers. We deﬁne

Gr(ℓ1, ℓ2, V ) = {(U1, U2) : U1 ⊆ U2 ⊆ V, dim(U1) = ℓ1, dim(U2) = ℓ2}.

Deﬁnition 7.4.8. Let ℓ be an integer and a be a multisegment. We let

E′′

a = {(T ′, W ′) : T ′ ∈ Ya, W ′ ∈ Gr(ℓ, ker(T ′|Vϕa,k))}.

Note that we have a canonical morphism

α′ : E′′

a → Gr(ℓ, ϕe(a)(k), Vϕa,k)

sending (T ′, W ′) to (W ′, ker(T ′|Vϕa,k)).

Proposition 7.4.9. The morphism α′ is a ﬁbration.

Proof. The morphism α′ is equivariant under the action of GL(Vϕa,k). The
same proof as in proposition 3.3.9 shows that the morphism α′ is actually
a P(U1,U2) bundle, where P(U1,U2) is a subgroup of GL(Vϕa,k) which ﬁxes the
given element (U1, U2). Now we take a Zariski neighborhood U of (U1, U2)
over which we have the trivialization

γ : α′−1(U) ≃ α′−1((U1, U2)) × U,

such an isomorphism comes from a section

s : U → GL(Vϕa,k), s((U1, U2)) = Id,

by γ((T, W ′)) = [(g−1T, g−1W ′), α′((T, W ′))], where g = s(α′((T, W ′))). We
remark that the existence of the section s is guaranteed by local triviality of
GL(Vϕa,k) → GL(Vϕa,k)/P(U1,U2), cf. [28], § 4.

Proposition 7.4.10. Assume that a is a multisegment satisfying (Ak) and
d = a + r[k + 1] for some r ≤ ϕe(a)(k). Let ℓ ∈ N such that r + ℓ = ϕe(a)(k)
and W a subspace of Vϕd,k+1 such that dim(W ) = r. We have a canonical
projection

p : (Xd)W → E′′

a

where for T ∈ (Xd)W with τW (T ) = (T1, T0) ∈ (Z k+1,d)W × Hom(Vϕd,k, W ),
we deﬁne p(T ) = (T1, ker(T0|W1)), where W1 = ker(T1|Vϕd,k) (Note that here
we identify (Z k+1,d)W with Ya, see the remark after proposition 3.3.12 ).
Moreover, let U1 ⊆ U2 ⊆ Vϕd,k be subspaces such that dim(U1) = ℓ, dim(U2) =
ϕe(a)(k), then p is a ﬁbration with ﬁber

{T ∈ Hom(Vϕd,k, W ) : ker(T |U2) = U1}.

Proof. We show that p is well deﬁned. Since by deﬁnition of (Xd)W we know
that

dim(W ) + dim(ker(T0|ker(T1|Vϕd,k ))) = dim(ker(T1|Vϕd,k )),

hence to see that

it suﬃces to show that

ℓ = dim(ker(T0|ker(T1|Vϕd,k ))),

ϕe(a)(k) = dim(ker(T1|Vϕd,k)),

this follows from the fact that a = d(k+1). Finally, we show that p is a
ﬁbration. Note that by deﬁnition, the ﬁber of p is isomorphic to

{T ∈ Hom(Vϕd,k, W ) : ker(T |U2) = U1}.

So it suﬃces to show that it is locally trivial. To show this, we consider the
open subset U in E′′
Now we construct a trivialization for p

a as constructed in the proof of proposition 7.4.9.

̺ : p−1(α′−1(U)) → α′−1(U) × {T ∈ Hom(Vϕd,k, W ) : ker(T |U2) = U1}

with ̺(T ) = [(T1, W ′), g−1(T0)], where g = s((W ′, W1)), W1 = ker(T1|Vϕd,k ).
Note that given

[(T1, W ′), T0] ∈ α′−1(U) × {T ∈ Hom(Vϕd,k, W ) : ker(T |U2) = U1},

take W1 = ker(T1|Vϕd,k ) then (W ′, W1) ∈ U, hence g = s((W ′, W1)) exists.
Let T ′

0 = gT0. Then T = τ −1

W ((T1, T ′

0)) ∈ p−1(α′−1(U)).

120

Deﬁnition 7.4.11. Let ℓ + dim(W ) = ϕe(a)(k). We deﬁne Ya to be the set
of pairs (T, U) satisfying

(1) U ∈ Gr(ℓ, Vϕa,k), T ∈ End(Vϕa/U) of degree 1;

(2) T ∈ Ob for some b (cid:22)k a.

And we have a canonical projection

σ : E′′

a → Ya

for (T, U) ∈ E′′

a, we associate

σ((T, U)) = (T ′, U)

where T ′ ∈ End(Vϕa/U) is the quotient of T . Also, we have a morphism

σ′ : Ya → Gr(ℓ, ϕe(a)(k), Vϕa,k),

by

σ′((T, U)) = (U, π−1(ker(T |Vϕa,k/U ))).

where π : Vϕa,k → Vϕa,k/U be the canonical projection.

Lemma 7.4.12. We have for T ∈ Ya,

(1) γk(T ) ∈ Z k,a;

(2) T |Vϕa,k−1 is surjective ;

(3) dim(ker(T |Vϕa,k/U )) = dim(W );

for γk, see deﬁnition 3.3.7.

Proof. (1)To show γk(T ) ∈ Z k,a, it suﬃces to show that for b (cid:22)k a, we
have b(k) ≤ a(k). Note that by proposition 7.1.7, there exists c ∈ S(a) and
Γ ⊆ c(k), such that

b = cΓ.

Now by lemma 7.4.3, we have c ∈ eS(a)k, which implies that

b(k) = c(k) ≤ a(k).

(2)By deﬁnition for any T ∈ Ya, we have Y ∈ Ob for some b (cid:22)k a. By
the fact that a satisﬁes the assumption (Ak), we know that any c ∈ S(a)
satisﬁes (Ak), hence

b = cΓ

121

cannot contain a segment which starts at k, therefore T |Vϕa,k−1 is surjective.
(3) Note that from the deﬁnition of Y, we know that for T ∈ Ya, we have
T ∈ Ob for some b (cid:22)k a. Now it follows

ker(T |Vϕa,k/U ) = ϕe(a)(k) − ℓ = dim(W ).

Proposition 7.4.13. Let a be a multisegment satisfying the assumption
(Ak). Then the morphism σ′ is a ﬁbration. Moreover, if we assume that
a = aId, cf. lemma 7.4.2, then the morphism σ is also a ﬁbration.

Proof. We ﬁrst show that σ′ is locally trivial. We observe that the group
GL(Vϕa,k) acts both on the source and target of σ′
in such a way that
σ′ is GL(Vϕa,k)-equivariant. As in the proof of proposition 7.4.9, let U ⊆
Gr(ℓ, ϕe(a)(k), Vϕa,k) be a neighborhood of a given element (U1, U2) such that
we have a section

s : U → GL(Vϕa,k), s((U1, U2)) = Id.

Note that in this case we have a natural trivialization of σ′ by

σ′ : β′−1(U) ≃ U × β′−1((U1, U2))

by σ′((T, U)) = [(U, π−1(ker(T |Vϕa,k))), g−1((T, U))] with g = s((U, π−1(ker(T |Vϕa,k)))).
Finally, we show that σ is surjective and locally trivial.
We observe that α′ = σ′σ and σ preserves ﬁbers. Now we ﬁx a neighborhood
U as above and get a commutative diagram

α′−1(U)

δ

/ U × σ′−1((U1, U2))

where δ([x, T ]) = [x, σ(T )] for any x ∈ U and T ∈ α′−1((U1, U2)). Therefore
to show that σ is locally trivial , it suﬃces to show that it is locally trivial
when restricted to the ﬁber α′−1((U1, U2)). Note that we have

α′−1((U1, U2)) ≃ {T ∈ Ya : ker(T |Vϕa,k) = U2} ≃ (X k

a )U2 ֒→ Ya(k)×Hom(Vϕa,k−1, U2)

and

σ′−1((U1, U2)) ≃ {T : T ∈ End(Vϕa/U1) of degree 1, ker(T |Vϕa,k/U1) = U2/U1,

T ∈ Ob, for some b (cid:22)k a} ֒→ Ya(k) × Hom(Vϕa,k−1, U2/U1).

Note that the canonical morphism

Hom(Vϕa,k−1, U2) → Hom(Vϕa,k−1, U2/U1)

is a ﬁbration. Hence to show that

α′−1((U1, U2)) → σ′−1((U1, U2))

is a ﬁbration, it suﬃces to show that σ|α′−1((U1,U2)) is surjective with isomor-
phic ﬁbers everywhere . Let (T, U1) ∈ σ′−1((U1, U2)) with

τU2/U1(T ) = (T0, q0) ∈ Ya(k) × Hom(Vϕa,k−1, U2/U1),

where τU2/U1 is the morphism in deﬁnition 3.3.13. We ﬁx a splitting U2 ≃
U2/U1 ⊕ U1. Now to give (T ′, U1) ∈ σ−1((T, U1)) amounts to give q1 ∈
Hom(Vϕa,k−1, U1) such that

τU2(T ′) = (T0, q0 ⊕ q1).

Note that by lemma 7.4.4, the condition a = aId implies that T ′ lies in (X k
if and only if q1 satisﬁes

a )U2

dim(ker(q0 ⊕ q1|ker(T0|Vϕa,k−1 ))) = ϕe(a)(k − 1),

which is an open condition. Therefore σ is surjective. By deﬁnition of Ya,
we know that

dim(ker(q0|ker(T0|Vϕa,k−1 ))) = ϕe(a)(k − 1) + ℓ,

therefore if we denote W1 = ker(q0|ker(T0|Vϕa,k−1 )), then q1 satisﬁes that

dim(ker(q1|ker(T0|Vϕa,k−1 )) ∩ W1) = ϕe(a)(k − 1).

Such a condition is independent of the pair (T0, q0) since we always have
dim(ker(T0|Vϕa,k−1)) = ϕe(a)(k − 1) + ϕe(a)(k) and dim(W1) = ϕe(a)(k − 1) +
ℓ.

We return to the morphism p and σ.

Lemma 7.4.14. Note that an element of Gϕd stabilizes (Xd)W if and only
if it stabilizes W . Let Gϕd,W be the stabilizer of W , then for c ≤ d, and
T ∈ Oc ∩ (Xd)W , we have

Oc ∩ (Xd)W = Gϕd,W T.

where ℓk+1 = ϕe(d)(k + 1). Note that we have

Gϕd,W = · · · × Gϕd,k × PW × Gϕd,k+2 × · · · ,

where Gϕd,i = GL(Vϕd,i). From this diagram we observe that the orbits there
is a one to one correspondance between the Gϕd orbits on X k+1
and Gϕd,W
orbits on α−1(W ). Finally, since Xd is an open subvariety consisting of Gϕd
orbits, we are done.

Deﬁnition 7.4.15. The canonical projection

induces a projection

π : Vϕd → Vϕd/W

π∗ : Gϕd,W → Gϕa,

where we identify Vϕd/W with Vϕa.

Proposition 7.4.16. The morphism p is equivariant under the action of
Gϕd,W and Gϕa via π∗, i.e,

p(gx) = π∗(g)p(x).

Moreover, it induces a one to one correspondance between orbits.

Proof. Note that for T ∈ (Xd)W , such that τW (T ) = (T1, T0) ∈ (Z k+1,d)W ×
Hom(Vϕd,k, W ), let

U1 = ker(T1|Vϕd,k), U0 = ker(T0|U1)

we have

Now it follows from the deﬁnition that we have

p(T ) = (T1, U0).

p(gT ) = π∗(g)p(T ).

Hence p sends orbits to orbits. It remains to show that the pre-image of an
orbit is an orbit instead of unions of orbits.

We proved in proposition 7.4.10 that

p−1p(T ) = {(T1, q) : q ∈ Hom(Vϕd,k, W ), ker(q|U1) = U0},

note that here we identify elements of (Xd)W with its image under τW . Let
(T1, q) ∈ p−1p(T ). Then we want to ﬁnd g ∈ Gϕd,W such that g(T1, T0) =
(T1, q). Note that by ﬁxing a splitting Vϕd,k+1 = W ⊕ Vϕd,k+1/W , we can
choose g ∈ Gϕd such that gi = Id ∈ GL(Vϕd,i) for all i 6= k + 1, and

g12

IdVϕd,k+1/W(cid:19) ∈ PW ,

where g1 ∈ GL(W ), and g12 ∈ Hom(Vϕd,k+1/W, W ). By hypothesis, we know
that the restrictions of q and T0 to U1 are surjective with kernel U0, so we
can choose g1 ∈ GL(W ), such that

g1T0(v) = q(v), for all v ∈ U1.

Finally, for v1 ∈ Vϕd,k+1/W , by our assumption at the beginning of this
section on a, we know that T1|Vϕd,k is surjective, hence there exists v ∈ Vϕd,k
such that T1(v) = v1. Then we deﬁne

g12(v1) = q(v) − g1T0(v).

We check that this is well deﬁned, i.e, for another v′ ∈ Vϕd,k such that
T1(v′) = v1, we have

q(v) − g1T0(v) = q(v′) − g1T0(v′),

this is the same as to say that

q(v − v′) = g1T0(v − v′).

We observe that T1(v −v′) = 0, hence v −v′ ∈ U1, now q(v −v′) = g1T0(v −v′)
follows from our deﬁnition of g1. Under such a choice, we have

g((T1, T0)) = (T0, q).

Hence we are done.

Proposition 7.4.17. The morphism σ is equivariant under the action of
Gϕa. Assume that a is a multisegment which satisﬁes the assumption (Ak).
Let ϕ ∈ S such that

ϕ + ℓχ[k] = ϕa,

125

where χ is the characteristic function. Then there exists a one to one corre-
spondance between the orbits of Ya and the set

S := {b ∈ S(ϕ) : b (cid:22)k a}.

Moreover, for each orbit Y(b) indexed by b, σ−1(Y(b)) is irreducible hence
contains a unique orbit in E′′

a as (Zariski) open subset.

Proof. The fact that σ is equivariant under the action of Gϕa follows directly
from the deﬁnition. To show that the orbits of Y under Gϕa is indexed by
S, consider the morphism

p′ : Ya → Gr(ℓ, Vϕa,k), (T, U) 7→ U

As in the proposition 5.3.2, we have the following diagram

Gr(ℓ, Vϕa,k)

which shows that p′ is a GLϕa,k bundle. Moreover, the same proof as in
lemma 7.4.14 shows that the orbits of Y are in in one to one correspondance
with that of the ﬁbers

p′−1(U) ≃ {T ∈ End(Vϕa/U) :T is of degree 1, T ∈ Ob for some b (cid:22)k a},

under the action of stabilizer Gϕa,U of U. Let ϕ ∈ S be the such that
ϕ + ℓχ[k] = ϕa. Then by identifying Vϕ with Vϕa/U, we can view p′−1(U) as
an open subvariety of Eϕ. Note that we are identifying orbits with orbits by
the canonical projection

Gϕa,U → Gϕ.

Now it follows that the ﬁbers are parametrized by the set S. Finally, let
b ∈ S. We have to show that σ−1(Y(b)) is irreducible, which is a consequence
of the following lemma.

Lemma 7.4.18. Let a, b be the multisegments as above. Then there exists
a bijection between the set

Q(a, b) = {c ∈ S(a) : b = cΓ for some Γ ⊆ c(k)},

and the orbits in σ−1(Y(b)) which respects the poset structure, given by

c 7→ E′′

126



o

where for b = cΓ,

c♯ = (c \ c(k)) ∪ Γ ∪ {∆+ : ∆ ∈ c(k) \ Γ},

a(c♯) is the orbit indexed by c♯. Moreover, the set Q(a, b) contains a

and E′′
unique minimal element.

Remark:
We remark that S(ϕ) contains a unique maximal element.

Proof. Recall that we constructed in proposition 7.4.10 a morphism p, con-
sider the composition

(Xd)W

σ−→ Ya,

p
−→ E′′

a

which sends (Oc)W to Y(b), where b = c(k,k+1) for c ∈ S(d). Hence we have

b = (c(k+1))Γ

for Γ = {∆ ∈ c : e(∆) = k}. Note that c ∈ S(d) implies that c(k+1) ≤ a =
d(k+1). Conversely, for c ∈ Q(a, b), such that

there is a unique element

b = cΓ,

c′ = c♯

in S(d) such that Oc′ ⊆ Xd and c = c′(k+1). Therefore we conclude that
there is a bijection between the Gϕa-orbits in σ−1(Y(b)) and Q(a, b).
Finally, for

ϕa = ϕb + ℓχ[k],

we show by induction on ℓ that the set Q(a, b) contains a unique minimal
element.
For case ℓ = 1, let

b(k) := {∆ ∈ b : e(∆) = k} = {∆1 (cid:22) · · · (cid:22) ∆h}.

and ci = (b \ ∆i) ∪ ∆+

i . Then

Q(a, b) ⊆ {ci : i = 1, · · · , h},

and ch is minimal in the latter, which implies that ch ∈ Q(a, b) and is
minimal. In general, let

ϕ = ϕb + χ[k].

127

Note that there exists c′ ∈ S(ϕ) satisfying the assumption (Ak) and Γ′ ⊆
c′(k) such that

In fact, by assumption, we know that

b = c′

Γ′.

for some c ∈ S(a) and Γ ⊆ c(k). Let

b = cΓ

such that ℓ = ♯Γ = ♯Γ′ + 1 and

then we have

Γ ⊇ Γ1,

c′ = cΓ1,

b = c′

Γ\Γ1.

Now we apply our induction to the case

Q1 := {c ∈ S(ϕ) : c satisﬁes the assumption (Ak), b = cΓ for some Γ ⊆ c(k)},

from which we know that there exists a unique minimal element c1 in Q1.
Now by assumption, we know that

b1 ≤ c′ (cid:22)k a,

and by induction, we know that the set Q(a, b1) contains a unique element
b2. We claim that b2 is minimal in Q(a, b). In fact, let e ∈ Q(a, b), then

b = eΓ′

for some Γ′ ⊆ e(k). Again let

Γ′
1 ⊆ Γ′, e′ = eΓ′

1

such that ℓ = ♯Γ′ = ♯Γ′

1 + 1. Now we obtain

e′ ∈ Q1, b = e′

Γ′\Γ′
1

.

By minimality of c1, we know that

c1 ≤ e′.

128

Note that this implies c1 (cid:22) e′, and by transitivity of poset relation, we get
c1 (cid:22)k e. Now we apply proposition 7.1.7 to get

for some f ∈ S(e) and Γ′′ ⊆ f(k). Again we deduce from induction that

c1 = fΓ′′,

Hence c2 ≤ e.

f ≥ c2.

Now we return to the calculation of product of perverse sheaves, cf. corollary
7.2.17.

Corollary 7.4.19. Let a be a multisegment satisfying the assumption (Ak)
and b (cid:22)k a such that

ϕa = ϕb + ℓχ[k].
Let c the minimal element in Q(a, b) and E′′
c in E′′

a. Then we have

a(c) be the Gϕa orbit indexed by

IC(Ob) ⋆ IC(Oℓ[k]) = β′′

∗ (IC(E′′

a(c♯))).

Proof. First of all, by deﬁnition

E′′ = {(T, U) : T ∈ Eϕa, T (U) = 0, dim(U) = ℓ},

therefore we have

E′′

a ⊆ E′′.

Furthermore, the variety E′′
morphism

a is open in E′′. In fact, consider the canonical

β′′ : E′′ → Eϕa,

a = β′′−1(Ya). Since Ya is open in Eϕa, we know that E′′

a is open in

then E′′
E′′. Now we have two morphisms

σβ′ :β′−1(E′′

a) → Ya,

β :E′ → Eϕb × Eϕℓ[k] ≃ Eϕb.

We claim that β−1(Ob) ∩ β′−1(E′′
in Y(b) under the action of Gϕa.
By deﬁnition of β, we know that

a) = β′−1σ−1(Y(b)), where Y(b) is the orbit

β−1(Ob) ∩ β′−1(E′′

a) = {(T, W, µ, µ′) :µ : W ≃ Vϕℓ[k], µ′ : Vϕa/W ≃ Vϕb,
T ∈ Of for some f ∈ S(a), b (cid:22)k f}.

129

Now by deﬁnition of σ and β′, we know that β−1(Ob)∩β′−1(E′′
Now by proposition 7.4.17, σ−1(Yb) contains E′′
a(c♯) as the unique open sub-
orbit, where c is the minimal element in Q(a, b). Therefore we conclude
that

a) = β′−1σ−1(Y(b)).

β′∗(IC(E′′

a(c♯))) = β∗(IC(Ob) ⊗ IC(Eϕℓ[k])).

Now by deﬁnition

IC(Ob) ⋆ IC(Oℓ[k]) = β′′

∗ (IC(E′′

a(c♯))).

7.5 Multisegments of Grassmanian Type

In order to precisely describe the previous corollary concerning Lusztig’s
product in the Grassmanian case in the next section, we generalize the con-
struction in section 3.3 to get more general results concerning the the set
S(a) for general multisegment a.
Let V a C vector space of dimension r + ℓ and Grr(V ) be the variety of
r-dimensional subspaces of V .

Deﬁnition 7.5.1. By a partition of ℓ, we mean a sequence λ = (ℓ1, · · · , ℓr)
for some r, where ℓi ∈ N , 0 ≤ ℓ1 ≤ · · · ℓr ≤ ℓ. And for µ = (µ1, · · · , µs) be
another partition, we say µ ≤ λ if and only if µi ≤ λi for all i = 1, · · · ,. Let
P(ℓ, r) be the set of partitions of ℓ into r parts.

Deﬁnition 7.5.2. We ﬁx a complete ﬂag

0 = V 0 ⊂ V 1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ V r+ℓ = V.

This ﬂag provides us a stratiﬁcation of the variety Grr(V ) by Schubert vari-
eties, labeling by partitions , denoted by X λ,

X λ = {U ∈ Grr(V ) : dim(U ∩ V ℓi+i) ≥ i, for all i = 1, · · · , r}.

Lemma 7.5.3. (cf. [31]) We have

And the Schubert cell

is open in X λ.

µ ≤ λ ⇐⇒ X µ ⊆ X λ.

Xλ = X λ −Xµ<λ

X µ

130

Deﬁnition 7.5.4. Let Ωr,ℓ be the set

Ωr,ℓ = {(a1, · · · , am; b0, · · · , bm−1) :Xi

ai = r,Xj

, bj = ℓ,

for 0 < i < m, ai > 0, bi > 0}.

Lemma 7.5.5. (cf. [31]) There exists a bijection

Ωr,ℓ → P(ℓ, r),

which sends (a1, · · · , am; b0, · · · , bm−1) to a partition of ℓ given by b0, b0 +
b1, · · · ,
, b0 + · · · + bm−1, and that the elements b0 + · · · + bi−1 ﬁgures in λ
with multiplicity ai.

Notation 7.5.6. From now on, we will also write

λ = (a1, · · · , am; b0, · · · , bm−1),

with notations as in the previous lemma.

We introduce the formula in [31] to calculate the Kazhdan Lusztig polyno-
mials for Grassmannians.

Deﬁnition 7.5.7. Let λ = (a1, · · · , am; b0, · · · , bm−1) be a partition. Follow-
ing [31], we represent a partition as a broken line in the plane (x, y), i.e, the
graph of the piecewise-linear function y = λ(x) which equals |x| for large |x|,
has everywhere slope ±1, and whose ascending and decreasing segments are
precisely b0, · · · , bm−1 and a1, · · · , am, respectively. Moreover, we call the lo-
cal maximum and minimum of the graph y = λ(x) the peaks and depressions
of λ.

Lemma 7.5.8. (cf. [31]) For λ, µ ∈ Ωr,ℓ, then

λ ≥ µ ⇐⇒ λ(x) ≥ µ(x), for all x.

From now on until the end of this section, we let

J = {σi : i = 1, · · · , r − 1} ∪ {σi : i = r + 1 · · · , r + ℓ − 1},

and

a := aJ,∅

Id = {∆1, · · · , ∆r, · · · , ∆r+ℓ}

be a multisegment of parabolic type (J, ∅), where

and

e(∆i) = k − 1, for i = 1, · · · , r,

e(∆i) = k, for i = r + 1, · · · , r + ℓ.

Remark: The set Rr(n) is a poset with respect to the relation ≥. And the
set ∪r≤nRr(n) is a poset with respect to the relation ⊇.

Proposition 7.5.11. For J = {σi : i = 1, · · · , r − 1} ∪ {σi : i = r + 1 · · · , r +
ℓ − 1}, we have an isomorphism of posets

by associating the element w with xw := (w−1(1), · · · , w−1(r)).

ς1 : SJ,∅

r+ℓ → Rr(r + ℓ),

132

Proof. Note that by deﬁnition

SJ,∅
r+ℓ = {w ∈ Sr+ℓ : w−1(1) < · · · < w−1(r) and w−1(r+1) < · · · < w−1(r+ℓ)}.

Therefore, ς is a bijection. This preserves the partial order, for a proof, see
[6] proposition 2.4.8.

Deﬁnition 7.5.12. For λ ∈ Ωr,ℓ and λ′ ∈ Ωr1,ℓ1 such that r + ℓ = r1 + ℓ1.
We deﬁne λ ⊇ λ′ if and only if xλ ⊇ xλ′, and λ (cid:23) λ′ if and only if xλ (cid:23) xλ′.

Deﬁnition 7.5.13. Let λ = (a1, · · · , am; b0, · · · , bm−1), consider the set

{b(∆) : ∆ ∈ aλ, e(∆) = k − 1} = {x1 < · · · < xr},

here we have r segments ending in k − 1 sinceXi

the element

xλ := (x1, · · · , xr).

ai = r, we associate λ with

This allows us to get a morphism ς2 : Ωr,ℓ → Rr(r + ℓ) sending λ to xλ.

Lemma 7.5.14. The map ς2 is an isomorphism of posets.

Proof. To see that ς is a bijection, we only need to construct an inverse. Given
x = (x1, · · · , xr) ∈ Rr(r + ℓ), we have y = (y1, · · · , yℓ) ∈ Rℓ(r + ℓ) such that
{1, · · · , r + ℓ} = {x1, · · · , xr, y1, · · · , yℓ}. We can associate a multisegment
to x

ax =

rXj=1

[b(∆xj ), k − 1] +

[b(∆yj ), k].

ℓXj=1

Note that this allows us to construct a partition λ(x) ∈ Ωr,ℓ by counting the
segments ending in k and k + 1 alternatively.
A simple calculation shows that if we write λ = (ℓ1, · · · , ℓr) with 0 ≤ ℓ1 ≤
· · · ≤ ℓr, then

ς2(λ) = (ℓ1 + 1, · · · , ℓr + r),

as described in [7]. This shows that

µ ≥ λ ⇔ ς2(µ) ≥ ς2(λ).

Proposition 7.5.15. For λ ∈ Ωr,ℓ, we have aλ ∈ S(a), moreover, all the
elements in S(a) are of this form. Moreover, we have S(aλ) = {aµ : µ ≥ λ}.

133

Proof. Let w ∈ SJ,∅, by deﬁnition, we have

w−1(1) < · · · < w−1(r), w−1(r + 1) < · · · < w−1(r + ℓ).

By deﬁnition, we have

ΦJ,∅(w) =Xj
=Xj

[b(∆w−1(j)), e(∆j)]

[b(∆w−1(j)), k − 1] +

r+ℓXj=r+1

[b(∆w−1(j)), k]

Now that ς −1

2 ◦ ς1 preserves the partial order, we have

S(aλ) = {aµ : µ ≥ λ}

by proposition 6.2.14.

Example 7.5.16. For example, for r = 1, ℓ = 3, with J = {σ2, σ3} and

a = aJ,∅

Id = [1, 4] + [2, 5] + [3, 5] + [4, 5].

Let λ = (a1, a2; b0, b1) = (1, 0; 2, 1), then aλ = [1, 5] + [2, 5] + [3, 4] + [4, 5].
This corresponds to the element ς −1

1 ◦ ς2(λ) = σ1σ2 in SJ,∅
4 .

Proposition 7.5.17. Let λ, µ ∈ Ωr,ℓ such that λ < µ. We have

Paλ,aµ(q) = Pλ,µ(q).

Proof. We can also prove this proposition in the following way. Let w, v ∈
SJ,∅
r+ℓ, such that

λ = ς −1

2 ς1(w), µ = ς −1

2 ς1(v).

Let PJ be the parabolic subgroup of GLn, then by ﬁxing an element in
V0 ∈ Grr(Cr+ℓ), we can identify PJ \GLn with Grr(Cr+ℓ). Moreover, the B-
orbits PJ \wB corresponds to the varieties Xλ, see [7] for a precise description.
Hence we have

Pλ,µ(q) = P J,∅

w,v(q) = Paλ,aµ(q).

Remark: One can surely prove this result using the open immersion we con-
structed in section 3.3.

Deﬁnition 7.5.18. Let λ ∈ Ωr,ℓ.

(1) We deﬁne

Γ(λ) = {µ ∈ Ωr1,ℓ1 : r1 + ℓ1 = r + ℓ, r1 ≥ r, µ (cid:23) λ}.

and

Γµ(λ) = {µ′ : µ ≥ µ′, µ′ (cid:23) λ},

Γµ
1 (λ) = {µ′ : µ ≥ µ′, µ′ ⊇ λ}.

(2) For µ ∈ Γ(λ), we deﬁne

Sµ(λ) = {λ′ ∈ Ωr,ℓ : λ′ ≥ λ, µ (cid:23) λ′},

and let

Sµ
1 (λ) = {λ′ ∈ Ωr,ℓ : λ′ ≥ λ, µ ⊇ λ′}.

Proposition 7.5.19. Let λ ∈ Ωr,ℓ and µ ∈ Ωr1,ℓ1 with r1 ≥ r and r1 + ℓ1 =
r+ℓ. Then π(aµ) appears as a summand of D k(π(aλ)) if and only if µ ∈ Γ(λ).

Proof. Let xλ = (xλ

Corollary 7.5.20. We have µ (cid:23) λ if and only if aµ (cid:22)k aλ.

Proof. By corollary 7.1.6, we know that aµ (cid:22)k aλ if and only if D k(π(aλ)) −
π(aµ) ≥ 0 in R, which is equivalent to say that µ (cid:22) λ by the previous
proposition.

Proposition 7.5.21. Let λ ∈ Ωr,ℓ and µ ∈ Ωr1,ℓ1. Then we have aµ = (aλ)Γ
for some Γ ⊆ aλ(k). if and only if we have µ ⊇ λ.

Proof. Let xλ = (xλ

7.6 Grassmanian case

As before, let

J = {σi : i = 1, · · · , r − 1} ∪ {σi : i = r + 1 · · · , r + ℓ − 1},

and

a := aJ,∅

Id = {∆1, · · · , ∆r, · · · , ∆r+ℓ}

e(∆i) = k − 1, for i = 1, · · · , r,

and

e(∆i) = k, for i = r + 1, · · · , r + ℓ.

Moreover, for λ ∈ P(ℓ, r), let xλ = (xλ

Let 0 < r0 ≤ ℓ and r1 = r + r0, ℓ1 = ℓ − r0.

Proposition 7.6.1. Let µ ∈ P(ℓ1, r1). Then there exists µ♭ ∈ P(ℓ, r), such
that

{b ∈ S(a) : aµ (cid:22)k b} = {aλ : λ ∈ P(ℓ, r), λ ≤ µ♭}.

More explicitly, if xµ = (xµ

1 , · · · , xµ

r1) = ς2(µ), then

xµ♭ = ς2(µ♭) = (xµ

r0+1, · · · , xµ

r1).

Proof. By lemma 7.4.18, we know that the set

{b ∈ S(a) : aµ (cid:22)k b}

contains a unique minimal element aµ♭ ∈ S(a) for some µ♭ ∈ P(ℓ, r). There-
fore we have

{b ∈ S(a) : aµ (cid:22)k b} = {aλ : λ ∈ P(ℓ, r), λ ≤ µ♭}.

aµ =

[b(∆xµ

aµ = (aµ♭)Γ

for some Γ ⊆ aµ♭(k).

Deﬁnition 7.6.2. Let

J1 = {σi : i = 1, · · · , r−1}∪{σi : i = r+1, · · · , r1−1}∪{σi : r1+1, · · · , r+ℓ−1},

where a = {∆1, · · · , ∆r+ℓ} with ∆1 E ∆2 E · · · E ∆r (cf. Def. 7.2.4).

And by deﬁnition of Xd, we know that Xd consists of the orbit Oc with
c ∈ S(d) such that ϕe(c)(k) + ℓ1 = ϕe(a)(k), and the latter condition implies
that there exists w ∈ SJ1,∅

r+ℓ such that c = aJ1,∅

Proposition 7.6.4. Let d = a + ℓ1[k + 1] and W ⊆ Vϕd,k+1 such that

Proposition 7.6.6. We have

7.7 Parabolic Case

In this section, as in the Grassmannian case, we deduce a formula for calcu-
lating the coeﬃcient n(b, a).
Let

be a subset of generators and

J ⊆ S

a = aJ,∅
Id

be some multisegment of parabolic type (J, ∅) associated to the identity,
satisfying fe(a)(k) 6= 0, fe(a)(k + 1) = 0.

140

Notation 7.7.1. For k ∈ Z, we let ℓk = fe(a)(k).

Deﬁnition 7.7.2. Let a(k) = {∆1, · · · , ∆ℓk} with ∆1 E · · · E ∆ℓk and r0 ∈ N
with 1 ≤ r0 ≤ ℓk. Then let

a1 = (a \ a(k)) ∪ {∆ ∈ a(k) : ∆ E ∆ℓk−r0} ∪ {∆+ ∈ a(k) : ∆ D ∆ℓk−r0+1},
a2 = (a \ a(k)) ∪ {∆− ∈ a(k) : ∆ E ∆r0} ∪ {∆ ∈ a(k) : ∆ D ∆r0+1}

and Ji(r0, k)(i = 1, 2) be a subset of S such that ai is a multisegment of
parabolic type (Ji(r0, k), ∅). Moreover, let

aJi(r0,k),∅
Id

= ai, for i = 1, 2.

n , such

{b ∈ S(a) : aw (cid:22)k b} = {av : v ∈ SJ,∅

n , v ≤ w♭}.

More explicitly, if aw(k − 1) = {∆1, · · · , ∆ℓk−1} with ∆1 E · · · E ∆ℓk−1, then
aw♭ = (aw\aw(k−1))∪{∆+ ∈ aw(k−1) : ∆E∆r0}∪{∆ ∈ aw(k−1) : ∆D∆r0+1}.

atw = (aw♭)♯.

Proposition 7.7.7. Let PJ and PJ1(ℓk−r0,k) be the parabolic subgroups corre-
sponding to J, J1(ℓk − r0, k) respectively. Consider the natural morphism

π : PJ1(ℓk−r0,k)\GLn → PJ \GLn.

Then

n(aw, av) =Xi

This proposition can be deduced from a construction of ﬁbration similar to
the one we did in Chapter 2 for symmetric multisegments, cf.§2.5.

7.8 Calculation of Partial Derivatives

Again, as previous section, we restrict ourselves to the case of multisegment
of parabolic type.

Deﬁnition 7.8.1. Let J1 ⊆ J2 ⊆ S be two subsets of generators of Sn. Let
v ∈ SJ1,∅
J2 (w, v) to be the multiplicities of IC(PJ2wB)
in π∗(IC(PJ1vB)), where

, we deﬁne θJ1

n

, w ∈ SJ2,∅

n

π : PJ1\GLn → PJ2\GLn

be the canonical projection.

Remark: By proposition 5.3.13, we know that in case where J1 = ∅, J2 = {si}
we have θJ1
J2 (w, v) = µ(siw, v) if ℓ(v) ≤ ℓ(siv), where µ(x, y) is the coeﬃcient
of degree (ℓ(y) − ℓ(x) − 1)/2 in Px,y(q).

Proposition 7.8.2. Let J ⊆ S be a subset of generators in Sn. Let k ∈ Z
and a be a multisegment satisﬁes all the assumptions in the beginning of
section 7.7. Then for any w ∈ SJ,∅

n , we have

D k(LΦ(w)) =

ℓkXr0=0 Xv∈S

J2(r0,k),∅
n

θJ1(ℓk−r0,k)
J

(w, tv)LΦ(v).

Proof. Note that by proposition 7.1.4

D k(π(Φ(w))) = Xb(cid:22)kΦ(w)

n(b, a)Lb.

Note that by proposition proposition 7.1.7, we know that b (cid:22)k Φ(w) implies
that

b = Φ(v),

for some v ∈ J2(ℓk − r0, k). Moreover, according to the proposition 7.7.7

n(Φ(v), Φ(w)) =Xi

dim H2i(π∗(IC(PJ1(ℓk−r0,k)tvB)))x

142

for some x ∈ PJwB. In fact, by the decomposition theorem, we have

π∗(IC(PJ1(ℓk−r0,k)tvB) = Mu∈SJ

n

⊕iIC(PJ uB)hi(u,tv )[di
u]

(7.8.3)

therefore

Furthermore, if we denote by

θJ1(ℓk−r0,k)
J

hi(u, tv).

(u, tv) =Xi
(u, tv)(q) =Xi

θJ1(ℓk−r0,k)
J

hi(u, tv)q−di

u/2

by localizing at a point of PJwB and applying proper base change, we get

Xρ∈SJ/J1(ℓk −r0,k)

qℓ(ρ)P J1(ℓk−r0,k),∅

ρw,tv

(q) =Xu

Now we return to the formula

θJ1(ℓk−r0,k)
J

(u, tv)(q)P J,∅

w,u(q).

(7.8.4)

π(Φ(w)) =Xu

P J,∅

w,u(1)LΦ(u).

(7.8.5)

By induction, we can assume that for u > w, we have that LΦ(v) appears in
D k(LΦ(u)) with multiplicity θJ1(ℓk−r0,k)
(u, tv). Then by applying the deriva-
tion D k to equation (7.8.5), on the right hand side we get the multiplicity of
LΦ(v) given by

J

x +Xu>w

θJ1(ℓk−r0,k)
J

(u, tv)P J,∅

w,u(1),

where x denotes the multiplicity of LΦ(v) in the derivative D k(LΦ(w)). And
on the right hand side, applying corollary 3.3.19, we get

Xρ∈SJ/J1(ℓk −r0,k)

P J1(ℓk−r0,k),∅
ρw,tv

(1).

Now compare with the equation (7.8.4) to get x = θJ1(ℓk−r0,k)

J

(w, tv)

From now on we consider the derivative D k(Lc) for a general multisegment
c such that fe(c)(k) > 0.

Proposition 7.8.6. There exists a multisegment c′ which is of parabolic type
(J1(c), ∅)( cf. deﬁnition 6.3.1) and a sequence of integers k1, . . . , kr, kr+1, . . . , kr+ℓ
such that Lc is the minimal degree term with multiplicity one in

k1D · · · kr D D kr+1 · · · D kr+ℓ(Lc′),

143

and

fe(c′)(i) = fe(c)(i),
fe(c′)(k + 1) = 0,
ki > k + 1,

if i > r.

if i ≤ k,

{∆ ∈ c : b(∆) = i0}.
Proof. Let i0 = min{i : fb(c)(i) > 1} and ∆0 = max
Then replace all segments ∆ ∈ c with b(c) < i0 by +∆ and ∆0 by +∆ to get
a new multisegment c1. Then if we let {i ∈ b(c) : i < i0} = {j1 < · · · < jr},
we have Lc is the minimal degree terms in

≺

j1−1D · · · jr−1D(Lc1),

Repeat this procedure to get c0 and a sequence of integers k1, · · · , kr such
that Lc is the minimal degree term with multiplicity one in

k1D · · · kr D(Lc0).

Suppose that fe(c0)(k + 1) > 0. Then replace all segments ∆ in c0 with
e(∆) > k by ∆+ to obtain c′, we are done.

Deﬁnition 7.8.7. We deﬁne

Γi(a, k) = {b ∈ Γ(a, k) : deg(b) + i = deg(a)},

where ℓk = fe(a)(k).

Deﬁnition 7.8.8. Let a be a multisegment and k, k1 ∈ Z. Then we deﬁne

Γi(a, k)k1 = {b ∈ Γi(a, k) : b ∈ S(b)k1, b(k1) ∈ Γi(a(k1), k)},
Γ(a, k)k1 = ∪iΓi(a, k)k1.

More generally for a sequence of integers k1, · · · , kr, we deﬁne

Γ(a, k)k1,··· ,kr = {b (cid:22)k a : b(k1,··· ,ki−1) ∈ Γ(a(k1,··· ,ki−1), k)ki for 1 ≤ i ≤ r}.

Similarly, we can deﬁne k1Γ(a, k) and k1,··· ,krΓ(a, k).

Remark: We can also talk about the set kr+1,··· ,kr+ℓ(Γ(a, k)k1,··· ,kr).

Lemma 7.8.9. Let k1 6= k − 1, then the map

is bijective.

ψk1 :Γ(a, k)k1 → Γ(a(k1), k)

b 7→ b(k1)

144

Proof. In fact we have Γi(a, k) = S(ai) where ai is constructed in the follow-
ing way: let a(k) = {∆1 (cid:23) · · · (cid:23) ∆r}, then

ai = (a \ a(k)) ∪ {∆−
j

: j ≤ i} ∪ {∆j : j > i}.

Note that Γi(a, k) = S(ai), which implies that we have

Γi(a, k)k1 = S(ai)k1.

Finally, note that by proposition 3.4.1 we have a bijection

ψk1 : S(ai)k1 → S(a(k1)

i

).

Note that k1 6= k − 1, k implies that a(k1)

i

∈ Γi(a(k1), k) and

Γ(a(k1), k) =[i

S(a(k1)

i

).

And if k1 = k, then

Γ(a, k)k = S(a)k, Γ(a(k1), k) = S(a(k)).

Hence we are done.

Lemma 7.8.10. Let k1, k ∈ Z then the map

k1ψ :k1Γ(a, k) → Γ((k1)a, k)

b 7→ (k1)b

is bijective.

Proof. If k1 6= k, the proof is the same as that of the previous lemma. Con-

Then for i ≤ ℓk, we have

ai = (a \ a(k)) ∪ {∆−

: j ≤ i} ∪ {∆j : j > i},

where ∆j = [k] if j > r0. And we have Γi(a, k) = S(ai). By deﬁnition, we
have b ∈ kΓi(a, k) if and only if

b ∈ kS(b),

(k)b ∈ Γi((k)a, k).

Since (k)a(k) = {∆1, · · · , ∆r0}, we know that for b ∈ kΓi(a, k), we must have
i ≤ r0. Also, let

((k)a)i = ((k)a \ (k)a(k)) ∪ {∆−
j

: j ≤ i} ∪ {∆j : r0 ≥ j > i}.

145

And we have Γi((k)a, k) = S(((k)a)i). Then we have

(k)ai = ((k)a)i.

Finally, we conclude that b ∈ kΓi(a, k) if and only if b ∈ kS(ai). Since the
map

kS(ai) → S((k)ai)

is bijective, we are done.

Proposition 7.8.11. Let b, c be two multisegments and k1 ∈ Z such that

If we write

then

b =(k1) c,

c ∈ k1S(c).

D k(Lc) = Lc + Xd∈Γ(c,k)\{c}en(d, c)Ld,
D k(Lb) = Lb + Xd∈k1 Γ(c,k)\{c}en(d, c)L(k1)d.

(7.8.12)

Proof. -Suppose that deg(c) = deg(b) + 1. In fact, by corollary 3.5.4, we
have

k1 D(Lc) = Lc + Lb

By applying the derivation D k and using the fact D k(k1 D) = k1D D k, we
have

D k(Lc) + D k(Lb) = Lc + Lb + Xd∈Γ(c,k)\{c}en(d, c)k1 D(Ld)

By assumption that deg(b) + 1 = deg(c), we have

k1 D(Ld) = Ld + L(k1)d or Ld,

where k1D(Ld) = Ld + L(k1)d if and only if d ∈ k1S(d) and deg((k1)d) =
deg(d) − 1. This is equivalent to say that d ∈ k1Γ(a, k).

-For general case, consider

{∆ ∈ c : b(∆) = k1} = {∆1 (cid:23) · · · (cid:23) ∆r}.

Now by proposition 3.5.1 and proposition 7.1.4, we know that

k1 D(Lc) = Lb + Xfd(k1)>fb(k1)en(d, c)Ld,

146

for some en(d, c) ∈ N.

If k1 6= k, then We observe that for any d such that fd(k1) > fb(k1) and
d′ (cid:22)k d, we have

fd′(k1) > fb(k1),

which implies that Ld′ can not be a summand of D k(Lb). Therefore we know
that

D k(Lb)

is the sum of all irreducible representations Ld′′ contained in D k(k1 D)(Lc)
satisfying

Applying the derivation k1D to the equation (7.8.12), we get

fd′′(k1) = fb(k1).

k1 D D k(Lc) = k1 D(Lc) + Xd(cid:22)k cen(d, c)(k1D)(Ld).

Note that in this case the sub-quotient of k1D D k(Lc) consisting of irreducible
representations Ld′′ satisfying

fd′′(k1) = fb(k1)

is given by

Lb + Xd∈k1 Γ(c,k)\{c}en(d, c)L(k1)d.

Compare the equation k1D D k(Lc) = D k(k1D)(Lc) gives the results.
If k1 = k, consider

{∆ ∈ c : b(∆) = k1} = {∆1 (cid:23) · · · (cid:23) ∆r}.

Let c′ be the multisegment obtained by replacing all segments ∆ in c such
that b(∆) < k1 by +∆, and ∆1 by +∆1. Then there exists

such that

and

k2 = k1 − 1 > k3 > · · · > kr

c = (kr,··· ,k2)c′,

b = (kr,··· ,k3,k1,k2,k1)c′.

Let b′ =(k1) c′, then by induction on fb(c)(k), we can assume that

D k(Lb′) = Lb′ + Xd∈kΓ(c′,k)\c′en(d, c′)L(k)d.

147

Applying what we have proved before, we get

D k(Lb) = Lb +

Also, we have

D k(Lc) = Lc +

Xd∈kr ,··· ,k3,k2 Γ(c′,k)\{c′}en(d, c′)L(kr ,··· ,k3,k2)d.

Since for any multisegment d, we have

(k,kr,··· ,k3,k2)d =(kr,··· ,k3,k,k2,k) d,

it remains to show that

kr,··· ,k3,k,k2,kΓ(c′, k) =k,kr,··· ,k3,k2 Γ(c′, k).

By deﬁnition and the following lemma, we can assume that r = 2. In this
case we argue by contradiction. Suppose that d ∈ k,k−1,kΓi(c′, k) and d /∈
k,k−1Γ(c′, k), which is equivalent to say that d /∈ k,k−1S(d). Note that d /∈
k,k−1S(d) implies that there exists two linked segments {∆, ∆′}, such that

b(∆) = k,

b(∆′) = k − 1.

Then (k−1,k)d contains the pair of segments {−∆, −∆′}. The fact that (k−1,k)d ∈
kS((k−1,k)d) implies that −∆′ = ∅, i.e. ∆′ = [k − 1]. However, this implies
that (k,k−1,k)d /∈ Γi((k,k−1,k)c′, k) since deg((k,k−1,k)d) + i = deg((k,k−1,k)a) + 1,
which is a contradiction.
Conversely, assume that d ∈ k,k−1Γ(c′, k) and d /∈ k,k−1,kΓi(c′, k), which by
deﬁnition is equivalent to d /∈ k,k−1,kS(d). Note that d /∈ k,k−1,kS(d) implies
that d /∈ kS(d), which contradicts to d ∈ k,k−1S(d).

Lemma 7.8.13. Let k > k − 1 > k′ be two integers. Then for any multiseg-
ment c, we have

k,k′Γ(c, k) = k′,kΓ(c, k).

Proof. Note that since for any multisegment d

the fact

(k′,k)d = k,k′

d,

k,k′Γ(c, k) = k′,kΓ(c, k)

148

is equivalent to

d ∈ k,k′S(d) ⇔ d ∈ k′,kS(d)

for all d ∈ k,k′Γ(c, k). But for any multisegment d and k > k − 1 > k′, we
have

d ∈ k,k′S(d) ⇔ d ∈ k′,kS(d).

Hence we are done.

Proposition 7.8.14. Let k1 6= k − 1, k, k + 1. Let b, c be two multisegments
such that

If we write

then

b = c(k1),

c ∈ S(c)k1.

D k(Lc) = Lc + Xd∈Γ(c,k)\{c}en(d, c)Ld,
D k(Lb) = Lb + Xd∈Γ(c,k)k1 \{c}en(d, c)Ld(k1).

Proof. The proof is the same as the proposition above.

Now let c′ = Φ(w) for some w ∈ SJ,∅
n .

Remark: The same way we deﬁne kθ(b, a) by the formula

(kD)(La) =Xb

kθ(b, a)Lb.

And let

Γ(k, a) = {b : kθ(b, c) 6= 0 for some c ∈ S(a)},

it shares similar properties with Γ(a, k).

Chapter 8

Multiplicities in induced
representations: case of a
segment

In this chapter we will consider the multiplicities m(c, b, a) of irreducible
components in the induced representation La × Lb,

La × Lb =X m(c, b, a)Lc.

Our goal in this chapter is then to determine a formula for the coeﬃcient
m(c, b, a) in case where b = [k − i0 + 1, k + 1](i0 ≥ 0) is a segment. Roughly
speaking, there are two major cases to discuss

(1) max b(a) ≤ k − i0 + 1,

(2) max b(a) > k − i0 + 1.

In §8.1 we treat the ﬁrst case, which is simpler to deal with. We have an ex-
plicit formula for the case where b = [k + 1] (cf. lemma 8.1.7 and proposition
8.1.5), and then we deduce by induction the general case (cf. proposition
8.1.12). For example the formula of proposition 8.1.5 looks like

La × Lb = La+b + Xc∈Γℓk −1(a,k)(cid:16)θk(c, a) − θk(c[k+1]1, a + b)(cid:17)Lc

[k+1]1[k]ℓk−1 .

where the θk(c, a) are deﬁned thanks to partial derivative, cf. notation 7.8.17.
Here our main tool is the derivatives for which we have complete formulas,
cf. proposition 7.8.16. Note that even in the case where b = [k + 1] is a
point, we come across the diﬃculty that we have D k(Lc) = Lc for certain

151

multisegments, cf.
example 8.1.10, which prevents us from applying the
partial derivations. Our idea here is to ﬁrst treat the case where fe(a)(k−1) =
0, cf. proposition 8.1.5, and then reduce everything to such case.
In §8.2, we describe a procedure to compute m(c, b, a) for the second case,
combining the ﬁrst case and partial derivatives.

Finally, we remark that our method could be used to deduce the general
multiplicities for case where b is not a segment. We intend to study this
general case in some future work.

8.1 When max b(a) ≤ k − i0 + 1

In this section we consider the case La × Lb where b = [k − i0 + 1, k + 1],
with i0 ≥ 0, is a segment and a is a multisegment satisfying

max b(a) ≤ k − i0 + 1.

Deﬁnition 8.1.1. Let b be a multisegment such that fe(b)(k + 1) = 0. Then
we denote by b[k+1]i the unique element in S(b + i[k + 1])k such that

c = (c[k+1]i)(k+1).

Proposition 8.1.2. Let a be a multisegment satisfying the condition

If we assume that

fe(a)(k − i0 − 1) 6= 0.

{t ∈ e(a) : t ≤ k − i0 − 1} =

rXi=1

ℓki[ki]

with k1 < · · · < kr = k − 1, then

m(c

[kr]ℓkr

[kr−1]ℓkr−1

···[k1]ℓ1 , b, a) = m(c, b, a(k1,··· ,kr)).

Proof. We prove by induction on i that

m(c

[ki]ℓki

[ki−1]ℓki−1

···[k1]ℓk1 , b, a) = m(c, b, a(k1,··· ,ki))

For i = 1, since a satisﬁes the hypothesis Hk1(a), by proposition 3.5.1,
D k1(La) contains a unique minimal degree term with multiplicity one, which
is La(k1), now apply D k1 to

La × Lb =Xc

m(c, b, a)Lc

152

and consider the minimal degree terms on both sides, we obtain

La(k1) × Lb = Xc∈S(a+b)k1

m(c, b, a)Lc(k1)

which gives the formula. Now for general i < r, assume that we have

m(c

[ki]ℓki

[ki−1]ℓki−1

···[k1]ℓk1 , b, a) = m(c, b, a(k1,··· ,ki)),

that is to say

La(k1,··· ,ki) × Lb = Xc∈S(a+b)k1,··· ,ki

m(c, b, a)Lc(k1 ,··· ,ki).

Now apply D ki+1 and the same argument as in the case where i = 1 gives

La(k1,··· ,ki+1) × Lb = Xc∈S(a+b)k1,··· ,ki+1

m(c, b, a)Lc(k1,··· ,ki+1).

Remark: If we assume that a is of parabolic type, i.e

then

\∆∈a

∆ 6= ∅

S(a)k1,··· ,kr = S(a).

Then by replacing a by a(k1,··· ,kr), we are reduced to the case where

fe(a)(k − i0 − 1) = 0.

Proposition 8.1.3. Let a be a multisegment such that

And let

fe(a)(k + 1) 6= 0.

{t ∈ e(a) : t ≥ k + 1} =

sXi=1

ℓki[ki]

with k1 < k2 < · · · < ks. Then

m(c, b, a) = m(c

[kr]ℓkr

[kr−1]ℓkr−1

···[k1]ℓk1 , b, a

[kr]ℓkr

[kr−1]ℓkr−1

···[k1]ℓk1 )

153

Remark: This proposition allows us to reduce to the case where

fe(a)(k + 1) = 0.

Proof. The proof is the same as that of the proposition above.

As usual, we reduce to the parabolic case by the following proposition.

Proposition 8.1.4. Let a be a multisegment satisfying max b(a) ≤ k −i0 +1,
then there exists a sequence of integers k1, k2, · · · , kr and a parabolic multi-
segments c of type (J1(a), ∅)such that

a = (k1,··· ,kr)c,

c ∈ k1,··· ,krS(c)

and if

then

m(d, c, b)Ld

Lc × Lb =Xd
La × Lb = Xd∈k1,··· ,kr S(c+b)

m(d, c, b)L(k1,··· ,kr )d.

Proof. The existence of c follows from proposition 6.3.3. To deduce our
result, it suﬃces to apply the derivation

(k1 D)(k2D) · · · (kr D)

m(d, c, b)Ld and then apply proposition 3.5.1.

to Lc × Lb =Xd

Proposition 8.1.5. Assume that a is a parabolic multisegment such that

fe(a)(k − i + 1) = 0

for some 1 ≤ i ≤ i0. Then

m(c, b, a) = m(c(k−i+2,··· ,k−1,k), b(k+1), a(k−i+2,··· ,k−1,k)).

Proof. The proof is the same as that of proposition 8.1.2

Remark: Combining the proposition 8.1.2, 8.1.4, 8.1.5, and 8.1.3, the calcu-
lation of the coeﬃcients m(c, b, a) for case (1) can be reduced to the case
where a is a parabolic multisegment such that

fe(a)(k −i0 −1) = fe(a)(k +1) = 0,

fe(a)(k −i+1) 6= 0, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ i0 +1.

154

From now on until the end of the section, assume that

aJ,∅
Id

be a multisegment of type (J, ∅) associated to the identity in Sn, which
satisﬁes

fe(aJ,∅

Id )(k − i0 − 1) = fe(aJ,∅

Id )(k + 1) = 0,

fe(aJ,∅

Id )(i) > 0 for k − i0 ≤ i ≤ k,

and ﬁx a bijection

and ai0 = Φi0(w).

Φi0 : SJ,∅

n → S(aJ,∅
Id )

Lemma 8.1.6. Under the above assumption, we have

J1(ℓk−i0 − r0, k − i0) = J2(ℓk−i0 − r0, k − i0).

Proof. This follows directly from the deﬁnition.

Lemma 8.1.7. Let b = [k + 1] and ℓk = fe(a0)(k). Then

La0 × Lb = La0+b + Xc∈Γℓk −1(a0,k)(cid:16)θk(c, a0) − θk(c[k+1]1, a0 + b)(cid:17)Lc

[k+1]1[k]ℓk−1

Proof. Note that

(k+1D)(La0 × Lb) = La0 × Lb + La0.

And for each c ∈ S(a0 + b) if [k + 1] ∈ c, then

(k+1D)Lc = Lc + L(k+1) c.

This implies that if c 6= a0 + b and [k + 1] ∈ c, then Lc can not be a direct
summand of La0 × Lb. Furthermore, by assumption on a0, we know that
for any c ∈ S(a0 + b) and [k + 1] /∈ c, we have c ∈ S(a0 + b)k and hence
c ∈ S(a0 +b)k,k+1. Moreover, we know that c(k,k+1) ∈ Γℓk−1(a0, k). Therefore
we have

La0 × Lb = La0+b + Xc∈Γℓk −1(a,k)

m(c, b, a0)Lc

[k+1]1[k]ℓk−1 .

Now apply the derivation D k to both sides of the equation to get

D k(La0 × Lb) = (Xc(cid:22)k a0

θk(c, a0)Lc) × Lb

= Xc∈Γℓk −1(a0,k)

θk(c, a0)Lc × Lb + other degree terms

155

and the right hand side we get

Xc∈Γℓk −1(c,a0+b)

θk(c, a0+b)Lc+ Xc∈Γℓk −1(a0,k)

m(c, b, a0)Lc[k+1]1 + other degree terms .

Now by the following lemma we know that for c ∈ Γℓk−1(a0, k)

Lc × Lb = Lc+b + Lc[k+1]1 ,

therefore by comparing the two sides, we obtain that for c ∈ Γℓk−1(a0, k)

m(c, b, a0) + θk(c[k+1], a0 + b) = θk(c, a0).

Hence we are done.

Lemma 8.1.8. Let a be a multisegment such that

max b(a) ≤ k + 1,

fe(a)(k) = 1,

fe(a)(k + 1) = 0.

Then we have

La × L[k+1] = La+[k+1] + La[k+1]1 .

Proof. First of all, it is known by Zelevinsky that La+[k+1] appears in La ×
L[k+1] with multiplicity one. Also, since

D k+1(La × L[k+1]) = La × L[k+1] + La,

we know that La[k+1]1 is the only element in S(a + [k + 1]) which appears
as a subquotient in La × L[k+1] and does not contain [k + 1] as a beginning.
Finally, since

k+1D(La × L[k+1]) = La × L[k+1] + La,

we conclude that a + [k + 1] is the only multisegment in S(a + [k + 1]) which
is a subquotient of La × L[k+1] and contains [k + 1] as a beginning.

In particular,gathering all the calculation in case where b = [k +1], we obtain
the following formula.

Corollary 8.1.9. Let a be a parabolic multisegment satisfying the condition

fe(a)(k) 6= 0,

fe(a)(k − 1) = fe(a)(k + 1) = 0,

and b = [k + 1]. Then

La × Lb = La+b + Xc∈Γℓk −1(a,k)(cid:16)θk(c, a) − θk(c[k+1]1, a + b)(cid:17)Lc

[k+1]1[k]ℓk−1 .

156

Remark: The proposition is no longer true if we remove the condition

fe(a)(k − 1) = 0.

Example 8.1.10. Let a = [0, 2] + [1, 3] + [2, 3] and b = [4], and

c1 = [0, 3] + [1, 4] + [2],

c2 = [0, 2] + [1, 4] + [2, 3], d = [0, 2] + [2] + [1, 3],

then

and

La × Lb = La+b + Lc1 + Lc2

D 3(La) = La + Ld, D 3(Lc2) = Lc2.

In this case we cannot compute the multiplicity of Lc2 using directly the partial
derivatives.

Remark: The proposition is also false if we remove the condition

fe(a)(k + 1) = 0

Example 8.1.11. Let a = [1, 2] + [2, 3] and b = [3], then

La × Lb = La+b

which contradicts our formula.

Proposition 8.1.12. Let ai0 = Φi0(w) and b = [k − i0, k + 1]. Then

157

Proof. Consider the formula

Lai0

× Lb =Xc

m(c, b, ai0)Lc.

(8.1.13)

In case k − i0 + 1 ∈ b(c), we know that c ∈ k−i0+1S(a + b), and moreover

m(c, b, a) = m((k−i0+1)c, (k−i0+1)b, a),

this gives the ﬁrst part of the formula in our proposition. Now if k − i0 + 1 /∈
b(c), then we have

fe(c)(i) = fe(a)(i), for all k − i0 + 1 ≤ i ≤ k,

fe(c)(k − i0) = fe(a)(k − i0) − 1.

In this case, we apply the derivative D k−i0+1D k−i0 to the equation (8.1.13)
and consider terms of degree equal to deg(c(k−i0,k−i0+1)). On the left hand
side we ﬁnd

here e runs through all the terms such that m(e, (k−i0+1)b, a) 6= 0. The ﬁrst
part in the coeﬃcient comes from the part

in the induction Lai0

×Lb so that by taking the diﬀerence, we get our results.

Remark: In general the multisegment d(k−i0+1) in the the formula does not
satisﬁes the condition

fe(d(k−i0+1))(i) = 0, for all k − i0 ≤ i ≤ k.

In order to proceed our calculation, we have to apply proposition 8.1.5.
Remark: Combining all the propositions above, we ﬁnish the computation of
m(c, b, a) in case where

b = [k − i0 + 1, k + 1], max b(a) ≤ k − i0 + 1.

8.2 General case

Now we consider the case (2) in the introduction of this chapter.

Proposition 8.2.1. Let k ∈ Z and a be a multisegment. Then there exists
a multisegment a′ and a sequence of integers k1, · · · , kr such that

a = (k1,··· ,kr)a′,

a′ ∈ k1,··· ,krS(a′),

and for any 1 ≤ i ≤ r,

deg((ki,··· ,kr)a) = deg((ki+1,··· ,kr)a) − 1, max b(a′) ≤ k.

Proof. This is proved by applying successively the truncation functor, which
is the same as the proof of proposition 6.3.3.

Proposition 8.2.2. Let a be a multisegment such that

a ∈ k−i0+1S(a),

fe(a)(k − i0 + 1) = 1.

If we assume that b = [k − i0 + 1, k + 1](i0 ≥ 0) and

La × Lb =Xc

m(c, b, a)Lc,

then

m(d, b,(k−i0+1) a) =Xc

m(c, b, a)(k−i0+1θ(d, c)) − m(d,(k−i0+1) b, a).

Proof. Note that by assumption we have

If we apply k−i0+1D to

k−i0+1DLa = La + L(k−i0+1)a.

La × Lb =Xc

m(c, b, a)Lc,

on the left hand side get

La × Lb + L(k−i0+1)a × Lb,

while on the right hand side we get

Xd Xc

m(c, b, a)(k−i0+1θ(d, c))Ld

by comparing the two hand side, we get our result.

Proposition 8.2.3. Let k1 6= k − i0 + 1 and a be a multisegment such that

a ∈ kS(a),

fe(a)(k) = 1.

If we assume that b = [k − i0 + 1, k + 1](i0 ≥ 0) and

then

La × Lb =Xc

m(c, b, a)Lc,

m(d, b, (k1)a) = m([k1]1d, b, a).

Proof. The proof is the same as that of proposition 8.1.4.

Remark: Combining the three proposition we get the computation of m(c, b, a)
for any a and b a segment.
