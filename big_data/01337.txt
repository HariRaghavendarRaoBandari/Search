A two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of hadron production in yields and spectra derived
from the charge-multiplicity dependence of 200 GeV p-p collisions at the relativistic heavy ion
collider (RHIC) is extended to describe p-p spectrum data from the large hadron collider (LHC)
up to 13 TeV. The LHC data include spectrum ratios that provide only partial information on the
TCM. The LHC ratio method is ﬁrst applied to well-understood RHIC spectrum data to derive an
algebraic link between spectrum ratios and the full TCM. LHC spectrum ratios are then analyzed
to obtain the collision-energy dependence of isolated soft and hard TCM spectrum components over
three orders of magnitude. The energy dependence of the spectrum soft component is a new result
suggesting a relation to Gribov diﬀusion. The spectrum hard component varies simply with QCD
parameter log(s/s0) and is quantitatively consistent with minimum-bias jet spectra. Some aspects
of the form of the hard component on transverse momentum are found to be multiplicity dependent,
possibly indicating bias of the underlying jet spectrum by an imposed event-multiplicity condition.

INTRODUCTION

A two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of
hadron production near mid-rapidity from 200 GeV p-p
collisions in terms of longitudinal projectile-nucleon dis-
sociation and transverse minimum-bias (MB) dijet pro-
duction derived from the charge-multiplicity nch depen-
dence of pt spectra [1] has been extended recently to con-
sider the nch dependence of pt-integral angular correla-
tions [2]. In that study an analysis of new high-statistics
pt spectra was observed to be quantitatively consistent
with a similar analysis completed ten years earlier. Anal-
ysis of 2D angular correlations revealed a signiﬁcant non-
jet quadrupole component as a novel aspect of p-p colli-
sions. The nch dependence of yields, spectra and correla-
tions has played a key role in establishing (a) the nature
of hadron production mechanisms in p-p collisions and
(b) that the dijet contribution to pt spectra is quantita-
tively consistent with QCD expectations [3–5].

The phenomenology of p-p collision data serves as an
essential reference for high-energy p-A and A-A collisions,
speciﬁcally regarding claims of novel physical mecha-
nisms such as formation of a quark-gluon plasma [6] or
possible manifestations of hydrodynamic ﬂows (“collec-
tivity”) even in small collision systems [7, 8]. It is im-
portant therefore to extend the TCM for p-p collisions
formulated with data from the relativistic heavy ion col-
lider (RHIC) to higher energies with analysis of p-p pt
spectra from the large hadron collider (LHC).

In Ref. [9] an analysis of the nch dependence of 13
TeV pt spectra is presented with indirect reference to a 7
TeV spectrum. The relation to previous TCM results is
not immediately clear due to the spectrum-ratio analysis
strategy adopted. Comparisons with Monte Carlo (MC)
models seem inconclusive. Those results prompt signif-
icant questions about spectrum analysis: what informa-
tion is conveyed by pt spectra, what is the best method

to extract all signiﬁcant information, how should the in-
formation be used to test theoretical models?

In the present study I review elements of the 200 GeV
TCM spectrum analysis from Refs. [1, 2] as an intro-
duction to the TCM and related analysis methods.
I
apply spectrum-ratio methods from Ref. [9] to 200 GeV
p-p spectra to illustrate the consequences for a data sys-
tem with established properties. I summarize negative-
binomial-distribution (NBD) models of multiplicity dis-
tributions (MDs) for several energies and infer the energy
dependence of charge yields relevant to the TCM. Stan-
dard TCM methods are then applied to 13 TeV spectrum
ratio data to isolate soft and hard spectrum components.
From those results and published spectra at 17.3 GeV
and 0.9 TeV I establish an accurate phenomenological
description of the nch and energy dependence of p-p pt
spectra extending over all presently-accessible collision
energies. The TCM arguably represents all information
carried by the spectra of unidentiﬁed hadrons. The jet-
related spectrum hard component is directly related to
event-wise-reconstructed dijet systematics, and Monte-
Carlo-simulated spectrum ratios are interpreted physi-
cally in relation to measured data systematics.

This article is arranged as follows: Section II summa-
rizes an analysis of pt spectra from LHC p-p collisions
featuring spectrum ratios as presented in Ref. [9]. Sec-
tion III provides a TCM description of spectra and yields
from p-p collisions. Section IV presents a TCM analysis
of 200 GeV p-p spectra applying spectrum-ratio meth-
ods as in Ref. [9]. Section V reviews 13 TeV probability
distributions on event multiplicity and event-multiplicity
collision-energy dependence. Section VI applies the TCM
to LHC spectrum-ratio data. Section VII describes the
collision-energy evolution of p-p pt spectra via the TCM.
Section VIII predicts the structure of 0.9 TeV pt spec-
tra as a quantitative test of the TCM representation.
Section IX discusses systematic uncertainties. Section X

tions XI and XII present discussion and summary.

II. LHC pt SPECTRUM ANALYSIS

Reference [9] presents pt spectra from 13 TeV p-p col-
lisions for several event-multiplicity classes in the form
of spectrum ratios. The introduction acknowledges that
both hard and soft QCD processes may play a role in
hadron production (the two elements of the TCM) but
they are not distinguished. The study is based on less
than 1.5 million (M) events (vs 3M accepted events for
Ref. [1] and 6M events for Ref. [2]). Reference [1] is cited
but its detailed spectrum analysis is not considered.

The evolution of p-p pt spectra with nch and collision
energy is studied via spectrum ratios that discard some
of the information in the individual spectra as demon-
strated below. p-p data are said to provide a reference
for A-A data and particularly for spectrum ratio RAA in-
tended to study jet modiﬁcation in A-A collisions. But as
a ratio RAA also discards essential information: in par-
ticular it conceals most of the jet contribution (whatever
appears below 4 GeV/c) that is essential to understand
QCD processes in high-energy nuclear collisions [10].

Measurements include extension of charge η density to
13 TeV (Fig. 2), a pt spectrum extending to 20 GeV/c
(Fig 3), a spectrum ratio comparing 13 and 7 TeV spectra
(Fig. 4) and spectrum ratios comparing 13 TeV pt spec-
tra from three multiplicity classes to a common reference
(Fig. 5). The pt spectrum data are said to show “...rich
features when correlated with the charged-particle mul-
tiplicity....”
It is concluded that spectrum ratios in
Fig. 5 demonstrate correlation of spectra with nch that
is stronger at higher pt, but that conclusion may be mis-
leading. The structure of individual spectra varies most
rapidly with nch at the mode of the spectrum hard com-
ponent near 1 GeV/c as demonstrated in Ref. [1] and
below. It is acknowledged that jets may play a role in
pt spectra, but no previous spectrum analysis address-
ing that subject is considered. Qualitative comments are
oﬀered about Monte Carlo comparisons with data.

III. A TCM FOR p-p COLLISIONS

mt = (cid:112)p2

Final-state hadrons from high-energy nuclear colli-
sions are distributed within a momentum space approxi-
mated near midrapidity (η = 0) by the cylindrical space
(pt, η, φ), where pt is transverse momentum, η is pseu-
dorapidity and φ is azimuth angle. Transverse mass is
h with hadron mass mh. Pseudorapid-
ity is η = − ln[tan(θ/2)] (θ is polar angle relative to
collision axis z), and η ≈ cos(θ) near η = 0. To im-
prove visual access to low-pt structure and simplify de-
scription of the pt spectrum hard component (deﬁned
below) spectra may be presented on transverse rapid-

t + m2

ity yt = ln[(mt + pt)/mh] with pt = mh sinh(yt) and
mt = mh cosh(yt). For unidentiﬁed hadrons yt with pion
mass assumed (80% of hadrons) serves as a regularized
logarithmic pt measure yt ≈ ln(2pt/mh). A typical detec-
tor acceptance pt > 0.15 GeV/c corresponds to yt > 1.

A. TCM context

The two-component model of hadron production in
high-energy nuclear collisions has been reviewed in
Refs. [1, 11] for p-p collisions and Refs. [3, 12, 13] for
A-A collisions. The TCM represents both a mathemati-
cal data model and a system of inferred data components
isolated according to the TCM that may then diﬀer from
TCM model functions (model elements), perhaps reveal-
ing novel physical mechanisms. The TCM then serves as
a reference for interpretation of data systematics based
on comparisons with theory.

The TCM applied to elementary collisions has been
interpreted to represent two main sources of ﬁnal-
state hadrons near midrapidity: longitudinal projectile-
nucleon dissociation (soft) and large-angle-scattered
(transverse) parton fragmentation (hard).
In A-A col-
lisions the two processes scale respectively proportional
to Npart (participant nucleons N ) and Nbin (N -N bi-
nary encounters). Analogous scalings for p-p collisions
have been considered in Refs. [2, 11]. The TCM accu-
rately describes most hadron yield and spectrum sys-
tematics [1, 12] and some aspects of angular correla-
tions [2, 13–15].

B. TCM for p-p single-particle pt or yt spectra

The joint single-charged-particle (SP) 2D (azimuth in-
tegral) density on yt and η is denoted by ρ0(yt, η) =
d2nch/ytdytdη. The η-averaged (over ∆η) yt spectrum
is ¯ρ0(yt; ∆η). The yt-integral mean angular density is

¯ρ0(∆η) = (cid:82) dytyt ¯ρ0(yt; ∆η) = nch/∆η averaged over

some acceptance ∆η. According to the pt spectrum TCM
hadron density ¯ρ0 has soft ¯ρs and hard ¯ρh components
related by ¯ρh = α¯ρ2
s for α = O(0.01) and ¯ρ0 = ¯ρs + ¯ρh [1].
Given some hypothesis α determined by spectrum anal-
ysis (see below) ¯ρs (and ¯ρh) can be obtained for any ¯ρ0
as the solution to a quadratic equation. For 200 GeV the
value from spectrum analysis is α ≈ 0.006 [1, 2].

The nch dependence of high-statistics p-p SP pt spectra
was studied in Ref. [1]. Systematic variation of spectrum
shapes lead to identiﬁcation of two ﬁxed forms whose
relative amplitudes vary smoothly with nch. The spectra
were thereby decomposed into soft and hard components
deﬁning a spectrum TCM. The TCM was not assumed
initially, emerged instead from the analysis.

Soft and hard spectrum components have approxi-
mately ﬁxed forms in p-p collisions, but the relative am-
plitudes vary with ¯ρ0 [1]. The relation of the hard com-
ponent to pQCD theory was established in Ref. [3]. The

soft component in Au-Au collisions retains its ﬁxed form
but the hard-component form changes substantially with
centrality, reﬂecting quantitative jet modiﬁcation [3].

where ¯ρs = ns/∆η and ¯ρh = nh/∆η are corresponding
η-averaged soft and hard hadron densities. The inferred
soft and hard yt spectrum shapes [unit normal ˆS0(yt)
and ˆH0(yt)] are assumed to be independent of n(cid:48)
ch, with
parametrized forms deﬁned in Refs. [3, 12]. The ﬁxed
unit-normal soft component is a L´evy distribution on mt

ˆS0(mt) ≡

A(T, n)

[1 + (mt − mh)/(nT )]n

(2)

with hadron mass mh, slope parameter T and L´evy ex-
ponent n that goes to a Maxwell-Boltzmann exponential
on mt in the limit 1/n → 0. Conversion from densi-
ties on pt or mt to densities on yt is via Jacobian factor
ptmt/yt. The ﬁxed unit-normal hard-component model
ˆH0(yt) (Gaussian plus exponential tail) relies on Gaus-
sian centroid ¯yt, Gaussian width σyt and “power-law”
parameter q. The slope is required to be continuous at
the transition point from Gaussian to exponential. An
algorithm for computing ˆH0(yt) is provided in Ref. [12]
(App. A). Whereas ˆH0(yt) on yt has the form ∝ e−qyt
at larger yt the corresponding ˆH0(pt) on pt approximates
the power-law form ∝ 1/pq+2
at larger pt (hence “power-
ˆH0(pt) is
law” tail). Hard component H(pt) = α¯ρ2
s
well-approximated by measured p-p fragmentation func-
tions convoluted with a measured 200 GeV minimum-
bias (MB) jet spectrum [3, 5]. Note that “power-law”
exponents n and q represent distinct soft and hard hadron
production mechanisms near η = 0.

t

The ﬁxed hard-component model developed in pre-
vious studies and described above is revised twice in
the present study in response to higher-statistics spec-
trum data, ﬁrst to accommodate data above the hard-
component mode in Sec. IV C and then to accommodate
data below the mode in Sec. X. To do so parameters σyt
and q are allowed to vary smoothly with nch. In what
follows expressions related by an “≡” symbol that de-
ﬁne data quantities are followed by corresponding TCM
expressions related by an “≈” symbol.

C. p-p hard component and dijet production

Based on a dijet interpretation for the spectrum hard
component [3, 4, 12] ¯ρh ≡ (∆η)f (n(cid:48)
ch)2¯nch,j, where
f (n(cid:48)
ch) is the dijet frequency per collision and per unit η,
(∆η) ∈ [0.5, 1] is the average fraction of a dijet appear-
ing in acceptance ∆η and 2¯nch,j is the MB mean dijet

3

fragment multiplicity within 4π. For 200 GeV non-single-
diﬀractive (NSD) p-p collisions with ¯ρs ≈ 2.5 and dijet
mean fragment multiplicity 2¯nch,j ≈ 2.5 ± 0.5 inferred
from measured jet systematics [1] frequency fN SD =
0.006 × 2.52/(0.55 × 2.5) ≈ 0.027 is inferred from p-p
spectra within ∆η = 1.
That value can be compared with the QCD prediction
fN SD = (1/σNSD)dσdijet/dη ≈ (1/36.5 mb) × 1 mb ≈
0.028 for 200 GeV p-p collisions [5] based on a measured
jet spectrum [16] and NSD cross section [17] correspond-
ing to a mean-value p-p parton distribution function.
Measured NSD hard-component density ¯ρh [1] is thus
quantitatively consistent with dijet systematics derived
from event-wise reconstructed jets [5, 16, 18]. If a non-
NSD p-p event sample with arbitrary mean n(cid:48)
ch is selected
the dijet frequency should vary with soft hadron density
¯ρs as

with ¯ρs,N SD = 2.5 for 200 GeV p-p collisions.

IV. 200 GeV pt SPECTRA vs nch

The multiplicity dependence of pt spectrum structure
from 200 GeV p-p collisions was reported in Ref. [1], and
the trend for angular correlation structure was reported
recently in Ref. [2]. To provide context for Ref. [9] we ap-
ply spectrum-ratio methods to 200 GeV spectra having a
previously-established TCM and physics interpretations
and compare those results to the LHC analysis.

Table I deﬁnes seven multiplicity classes for the study
in Ref. [2] that apply to the spectrum data considered
here. n(cid:48)
ch is an uncorrected multiplicity within ∆η = 2
related to corrected multiplicity nch by n(cid:48)
ch = ξnch. The
ch(cid:105) are distribution-weighted bin mean values. ¯ρ0 and
(cid:104)n(cid:48)
¯ρs are corrected for eﬃciencies and pt acceptance.

A. pt spectrum data vs nch

Figure 1 (left) shows yt spectra for six multiplicity
classes. The spectra (uncorrected for tracking ineﬃcien-

cies) are normalized by corrected soft component ¯ρs. A
common yt-dependent ineﬃciency function is introduced
for comparison of this analysis with corrected spectra in
Ref. [1], indicated below yt = 2 by the ratio of the two
bold dotted curves representing uncorrected S(cid:48)
0(yt) and
corrected ˆS0(yt) soft model functions. The data spectra
are represented by spline curves rather than individual
points to emphasize systematic variation with n(cid:48)

ch.

adjusted slightly to better accommodate the data in
the right panel. The bold dashed line at right in each
panel represents power-law trend ˆH0(pt) ∝ 1/p7

ing (by hypothesis) the underlying jet spectrum over a
limited jet energy interval [3, 5]. The UA1 200 GeV
jet spectrum [16] is approximately dσj/dpjet ∝ 1/p6

near 10 GeV/c, as in Fig. 8 of Ref. [5]. The trend
ˆH0(pt) ∝ dnh/ptdpt ∝ 1/p7
t is then fully consistent with
convoluting a ﬁxed fragmentation-function (FF) ensem-
ble with the underlying jet spectrum [3]. The bold solid
curve labeled α¯ρs ˆH0(yt) (for ¯ρs = 2.5) in the left panel es-
timates a ﬁxed hard component for 200 GeV NSD p-p col-
lisions in relation to corresponding soft component ˆS0(yt)

GeV/c) suggests the requirement for a decreasing power-
law exponent q with increasing nch, as might be expected
if demand for larger event multiplicities biases to more
jet fragments. Although the ratio deviations from unity
at lower yt are smaller in absolute magnitude they are
statistically more signiﬁcant as discussed in Sec. IX B.

Figure 4 (left) shows data/TCM ratios based on a re-
vised TCM with two hard-component ˆH0(pt) parameters
varying. Whereas ˆH0(yt) was previously held ﬁxed with
power-law index q = 5 and width σyt = 0.465 those pa-
rameters are now varied to accommodate individual spec-
tra as described below. The modiﬁed TCM describes
data above the mode within statistics (bold solid curves).
Substantial spectrum deviations from the ﬁxed TCM cor-
related with nch appear in Fig. 1 (right) below the mode,
but the corresponding manifestations in Fig. 4 (left) be-
low yt = 3 are strongly suppressed by the ratio format.
Further modiﬁcation could also accommodate those de-
viations as described in Sec. X (with the exception of the
n = 1 high solid curve), but they do not play a signiﬁcant
role in the spectrum ratios encountered in this section.

FIG. 3: Left: Hard-soft ratio T (pt) (points) for two spectrum
ratios. Since the ratios are inverses the data systems coincide
here. The 200 GeV TCM model ratio T0(pt) ≡ ˆH0(py)/ ˆS0(pt)

component σyt = 0.465 and q = 5.0. Right: Ratios of data
spectra to TCM equivalents with ﬁxed hard component for

ch. The two smooth solid curves
symmetric about unity represent one-sigma statistical errors.

sented by the dotted and dash-dotted lines. The variation
of two parameters in combination serves to broaden the
hard-component model above the mode toward higher
pt. The saturation of σyt at larger ¯ρs is a consequence of
decreasing q. The transition point on ˆH0(yt) from Gaus-
sian to exponential then moves back toward the mode
and the exponential/power-law tail increasingly domi-
nates the higher-pt structure. ˆH0(pt) broadening could
represent hardening of the underlying parton spectrum
and/or modiﬁed jet formation. The similar parameter
trends for 13 TeV are discussed in Sec. VI C.

to Fig. 5 of Ref. [9] for comparison. The reference spec-
trum in this case is the TCM spectrum for n = 3, with
ˆH0(yt) parameters that happen to coincide with the ﬁxed
model from Refs. [1, 2]. Following Ref. [9] each spec-
trum is normalized by its integral ¯ρ0(n(cid:48)

curves represent TCM spectra with varying hard com-
ponent. The revised TCM is accurate at the percent
level for all multiplicity classes. Dashed curves repre-
sent TCM spectra with ﬁxed hard component. Dotted

a spectrum-ratio TCM with ﬁxed hard component. Note
that in this case spectrum ratios compare six spectra to
a single n = 3 TCM reference whereas ratios in Figs. 3

responding TCM spectrum for the same conditions.

The TCM hard-component model has been held ﬁxed
previously to retain model simplicity, as in Refs. [1–3].
The present study demonstrates that high-statistics data
from Ref. [2] convey substantial new information about

6

the dijet contribution to p-p hadron spectra that is sim-
ply represented by smooth variation of existing ˆH0(yt)
parameters. It also illustrates the utility of the TCM as
a reference relative to which novel data properties can
be detected and interpreted. Data/TCM spectrum ra-
tios are apparently more easily described and interpreted
than data/data ratios presented without a reference.

V. LHC p-p CHARGE MULTIPLICITIES

The LHC spectrum study in Ref. [9] refers to imposed
charge-multiplicity conditions not fully speciﬁed. To bet-
ter provide a comparison with RHIC data information on
LHC charge multiplicities from Ref. [19] can be used.
In particular there are issues of consistency between
direct dnch/dη density measurements and multiplicity-
distribution (MD) mean values ¯nch that should coincide.
Charge densities on η are reported in Table 7 of Ref. [19]
for three event classes and several energies. In this study
results for NSD events and |η| < 0.5 are emphasized as
a common reference. Results for other conditions are
scaled accordingly. Table 12 of Ref. [19] includes mean
values ¯nch from parametrizations of data MDs that may
be contrasted with the direct density measurements.

A. Multiplicity distributions and binnings

Probability distributions on p-p event multiplicity can
be described by a single negative binomial distribution
(NBD) at lower collision energies, but at higher energies
a double NBD is required by data [20]. The relevant def-
initions are provided by Eqs. (14) and (16) from Ref. [19]

(NBD), with parameters from Table II. Right: Distributions
from the left panel plotted on a linear scale. The vertical solid
lines indicate multiplicity bin boundaries deﬁned in Ref. [9].
The vertical dashed lines are bin means determined in the
present study from the ﬁtted 13 TeV NBD distribution (bold).

Figure 6 (right) shows the same distributions on a
linear scale with the multiplicity bin system deﬁned in
Ref. [9]. Referring to the 13 TeV distribution (bold solid
curve) the left solid vertical line is at the 13 TeV distri-
bution mean ¯ρ00 = 6.2. The right solid line is at twice
that value, together deﬁning three multiplicity bins A, B
and C. The deﬁnitions in Ref. [9] are based on the ac-
cepted multiplicity N acc
ch within ∆η = 1.6, but a single
common eﬃciency factor should apply to all values. The
vertical dashed lines indicate three bin means located ap-
proximately at 3, 9 and 15 compared to ensemble mean
¯ρ00 = 6.2. The ratios to ¯ρ00 are then approximately 3/6.2
= 0.48 for A, 9/6.2 = 1.45 for B and 15/6.2 = 2.4 for C.

B. Event-multiplicity energy dependence

The energy dependence of p-p event multiplicities at
collision energies up to 13 TeV can be inferred from sev-
eral sources, including INEL > 0 data from Ref. [9] and
data for several trigger conditions from Ref. [19].

Figure 7 shows data (open squares) for ﬁve energies
from Table 7 of Ref. [19] scaled to NSD (yields in Table
7 scale as INEL:NSD:INEL > 0 = 0.81:1.00:1.04). The
solid square is 13 TeV INEL > 0 (inelastic events with
at least one charged particle accepted) datum 6.46 from
Ref. [9] scaled down by 1.04 to NSD value 6.21. The solid
dots are NBD means ¯ρ00 from Table II (except 13 TeV).
The dotted curve is the soft-component estimate ¯ρs ≈
√

low-x gluons from projectile dissociation. That trend
determines the ¯ρs values in Table III. The intercept 10

value 6.21. The solid dots are weighted means of NBD dis-
tributions in Fig. 6 from ﬁts to measured MDs in Ref. [19]
reported as ¯ρ00 in Table II. The solid triangle is an estimate
of the NSD value for 200 GeV, and the open circle is an ex-
trapolation to 17.3 GeV. The curves are described in the text.

The “power law” trend 0.76s0.114 (dashed) reported in
Ref. [19] provides an approximate empirical description
of the total charge density near η = 0 down to lower
energies (especially data below 100 GeV), but that re-
sult may be misleading. One can question whether the
power-law trend represents a single production mecha-
nism when two or three mechanisms may contribute with
very diﬀerent energy dependences. The dotted and solid
TCM curves are interpreted to represent hadron produc-
tion from low-x gluons that must fall to zero at lower
collision energies, whereas hadron production relating to
valence quarks near η = 0 (possibly the diﬀerence nvq
between dashed and solid curves) should fall to zero at
higher energies but may dominate at lower energies.

Higher-energy data appear to support that picture.
The solid dots are weighted means of NBD distribu-
tions in Fig. 6 that describe accurately the NSD MDs
in Ref. [19]. Those NBD-based estimates, systematically
displaced from (but consistent with) ALICE NSD data

C. Accepted vs corrected multiplicities and ratios

In Sec. IV B accurate knowledge of the ¯ρs values for
diﬀerent event classes was essential to process spectrum
ratios and interpret the results. The corresponding in-
formation in Ref. [9] seems incomplete. The relation to
accepted multiplicities N acc
ch should be as follows. The
acceptance factor corresponding to a pt acceptance cut-
oﬀ near 0.15 GeV/c is 0.80 ± 0.02 according to Fig. 2
(right) of Ref. [21]. That factor should change little with
collision energy since it is determined mainly by ﬁxed
slope parameter T ≈ 145 MeV. The factor correspond-
ing to mean tracking eﬃciency is 0.70 ± 0.03 averaged
over the accepted pt interval, based on Sec. 3 of Ref. [9].
Collision-energy dependence should again be small. The
overall acceptance factor should then be 0.56±0.04 ≈ 0.6.
In Ref. [9] the reported fully-corrected charge density
for the INEL > 0 event class is dnch/dη = 6.46 within
|η| < 0.5 and 6.61 within |η| < 1.0. For the spectrum
study the accepted charge density within |η| < 0.8 is
n(cid:48)
ch/∆η = 6.73/1.6 = 4.2 while the density (possibly)
corrected for tracking eﬃciency but within pt > 0.15
GeV/c is n(cid:48)(cid:48)
ch/∆η = 9.41/1.6 = 5.88 (“from the spectrum
in Fig. 3”). Interpolated to |η| < 0.8 the fully-corrected
charge density should be dnch/dη ≈ 6.55, and the im-
plied overall acceptance factor is then 4.2/6.55 = 0.64,
somewhat higher than the expected 0.57. The ratio 5.88
/ 6.55 = 0.90 is also substantially higher than the ex-
pected pt-acceptance factor 0.80. However, 4.2/5.88 =
0.71 is consistent with the expected tracking eﬃciency
0.70. Although not self-consistent the acceptance factors
should cancel in the multiplicity ratios 0.48 (A), 1.45 (B)
and 2.4 (C) calculated above. However, there seem to
be substantial diﬀerences between those values and what
can be inferred from spectrum ratios in the next section.

spectrum with multiplicity...is stronger at high pT ....with
jets presumably dominating the high-multiplicity do-
main.” It is further noted that “The general features...are
similar to those ﬁrst seen at
s = 0.9 TeV [22].” There
is no reference to previous results in Refs. [1, 3, 4, 12]
where diﬀerential study of p-p pt spectrum nch depen-
dence and quantitative theoretical interpretations were
ﬁrst established, as summarized in Secs. III and IV.

√

The spectrum ratios in Fig. 5 of Ref. [9] provides only
indirect information on TCM elements in the form of
ratio T (pt) ≡ ˆH0(pt)/ ˆS0(pt) per Eq. (11). By suitable
transformation of ratio data in several steps T (pt) trends
for two of the multiplicity bins can be determined (the
spectrum ratio from bin B provides no signiﬁcant infor-
mation). An intermediate parametrization of the T (pt)
data is deﬁned in terms of the 200 GeV ˆS0(pt) model by
adjusting the ˆH0(pt) model parameters to ﬁt the inferred
13 TeV T (pt) data. That intermediate parametrization
is not intended as a ﬁnal description of 13 TeV spectra.
To obtain the correct soft-component model for 13 TeV
data the spectrum in Fig. 3 of Ref. [9] is then ﬁtted by
varying only ˆS0(pt) in the modiﬁed TCM expression

¯ρ0(pt; n(cid:48)

ch) = ¯ρs(n(cid:48)

ch) ˆS0(pt) [1 + α¯ρs(n(cid:48)

ch)T0(pt)] ,(10)

where ﬁxed T0(pt) is represented by the intermediate
data parametrization noted above. The single parameter
n in the ˆS0(pt) model is adjusted to ﬁt the spectrum data.
Given the ﬁtted 13 TeV soft-component model the cor-
responding hard-component model could be recovered as
ˆH0(pt) = ˆS0(pt)T (pt) relying only on 13 TeV data, thus
establishing a complete TCM for 13 TeV pt spectra.

In Sec. IV it was demonstrated that for high-statistics
200 GeV p-p spectra a TCM with ﬁxed hard component
deviates signiﬁcantly from data at higher pt. A hard-
component model with two parameters varying with nch
is required by those data. For analysis of spectrum-ratio
data from Ref. [9] we assume from the beginning a vary-
ing hard component and infer its parameter trends.

VI. 13 TEV pt SPECTRUM RATIOS vs nch

B. Spectrum ratios vs nch and hard/soft ratio T(pt)

In this section the spectrum TCM is applied to LHC
pt spectra and spectrum ratios from Ref. [9] to infer sep-
arate soft- and hard-component spectrum models from
the data.
In the following section the collision-energy
dependence of each TCM component is considered.

A. Analysis strategy

The 13 TeV spectrum study in Ref. [9] deﬁnes three
multiplicity classes A, B and C as described in Sec. V A.
Ratios are formed in which the pt spectrum from each
class is divided by the INEL > 0 ensemble-mean spec-
trum adopted as a reference. The results are presented in
Fig. 5 of Ref. [9]. It is concluded that “correlation of the

Spectrum ratios R(pt; n(cid:48)

multiplicity bins indexed by n(cid:48)
ch. Spectra averaged over
acceptance ∆η = 1.6 are ﬁrst normalized by their pt inte-
grals as ¯ρ(cid:48)

data are then represented by the ﬁrst line of

∆η = 1) rather than ¯ρs as in Fig. 1 (left) of the present
study. The excursions about unity at lower pt, deﬁned by
s0 ≈ 0.15, can be com-

justing ˆH0(pt) parameters to ﬁt the 13 TeV T (pt) data
(¯yt = 2.4, σyt = 0.52 and q = 7). That parametriza-

The dash-dotted curve is the MC curve in Fig. 8 (left)

ing hard component as described in Sec. VI C. Right: Data

model parameters. The lower dashed curve is T0(pt) for 200
GeV. The dotted curves indicate the result if data were trans-
formed assuming a ﬁxed hard component. The dash-dotted
curve follows from the MC curves in Fig. 8 (left).

therefore including many more low-energy jets.1

From the combination of limiting values for R(pt) and
X(pt) at small and large pt respectively the product
α¯ρs0 for NSD collisions can be inferred uniquely from
the spectrum-ratio data. ¯ρs/¯ρs0 is estimated from lim-
iting cases of Eq. (12) at larger pt and combined with
Eq. (11) limiting cases at smaller pt to provide the es-
s0 ≈ 0.15 ≈ α¯ρs0/ξ. Since ξ ≈ 0.6 for these
timate α(cid:48) ¯ρ(cid:48)
data α¯ρs0 ≈ 0.09 and (for ¯ρs0 ≈ 6) α ≈ 0.015± 0.0015 at
13 TeV vs α ≈ 0.006 ± 0.001 at 200 GeV [1, 2]. The jet-
fragment yield per participant (∼ α¯ρso) is 6 times larger
at 13 TeV than at 200 GeV and the total jet-fragment
yield (∼ ¯ρh ≈ α¯ρ2

s0) is 14 times larger.

Figure 10 (left) converts Fig. 8 (right) to a log-log for-
mat to demonstrate that the change in ˆH0 with nch rela-
tive to the ﬁxed reference in T0(pt) is larger for bin A data
(open points) than for bin C data (solid points). That
explains why bin A data in Fig. 9 (right) are further from
the reference (dashed curve) than bin C data.

Figure 10 (right) shows the variation with ¯ρs of two
hard-component parameters required to match the ratio
data in previous 13 TeV ﬁgures. The trends are similar
in form to that for 200 GeV in Sec. IV B but with much-
reduced relative variation. These values relative to a 200

1 The conclusion in Ref. [1] that the hard-component yield from
PYTHIA is less than that inferred from data is incorrect. Plotted
PYTHIA curves are comparable to α¯ρs ˆH0(yt) with α¯ρs ≈ 0.015
for 200 GeV NSD p-p collisions. The PYTHIA hard-component
density ¯ρh is thus 3-5 times larger than that inferred from data.

C. Full 13 TeV TCM derived from spectrum ﬁt

Spectrum ratio data provide information only about
hard/soft ratio T (pt) = ˆH0(pt)/ ˆS0(pt). A ﬁt to at
least one spectrum is required to isolate individual data
components and deﬁne TCM model functions. Given a
parametrization of 13 TeV reference T0(pt) the 13 TeV
ˆS0(pt) model is derived from a spectrum ﬁt and a 13 TeV
ˆH0(pt) model is derived from the combination.

Figure 11 (left) (points) represents the INEL > 0 spec-

trum from Fig. 3 of Ref. [9]. The ﬁtted TCM (solid) is

¯ρ00(pt) = ¯ρs0 ˆS0(pt; T, n) [1 + α¯ρs0T0(pt)]

(15)

with α¯ρs0T0(pt) represented by the dashed curve in Fig. 9
(right). The only TCM adjustment is variation of expo-
nent n in the usual L´evy form of ˆS0(mt; T, n) in Eq. (2)
to ﬁt the spectrum data, with slope parameter T = 145
MeV kept ﬁxed. The ﬁtted L´evy exponent n ≈ 7.8 at 13
TeV can be compared with n ≈ 12.5 at 200 GeV [2].

Figure 11 (right) demonstrates the quality of the TCM
description with the ﬁt residuals (points). There is no
systematic deviation of data from the optimized TCM.
Point-to-point deviations are dominated by uncertainties
in extracting data values from Fig. 3 of Ref. [9]. Given
optimized soft-component model function ˆS0(pt; T, n) the
13 TeV hard-component model could be obtained as the
product ˆH0(pt) = ˆS0(pt)T0(pt) using the parametrization
in Fig. 9 (right) (dashed). Alternatively, the data hard
component can be inferred directly by subtracting ˆS0(pt)
as in Fig. 1 (right) and ﬁtted with its own 13 TeV ˆH0(pt)
model. The two methods are consistent within 5%.

A. Energy evolution of spectrum soft component

The spectrum soft component at 13 TeV is substan-
tially diﬀerent from that at 200 GeV inferred in Ref. [1]
in that the L´evy exponent changes from n ≈ 12.5 at 200
GeV to n ≈ 7.8 at 13 TeV. Results from CERN super
proton synchrotron (SPS) p-p spectra can be used to es-
timate the trend over a large energy interval.

Figure 12 (left) shows an mt spectrum for identi-
ﬁed pions (points) from 17.3 GeV inelastic p-p colli-
sions [24] well described by a L´evy distribution (solid
curve) with exponent n ≈ 27 and the usual slope pa-
rameter T = 145 MeV. Also shown is the correspond-
ing Maxwell-Boltzmann (M-B) distribution (dash-dotted
curve) with 1/n → 0 and the same slope parameter.
Given the known energy dependence of the jet contri-
bution [5] the spectrum hard component should produce
at most a slight deviation from the soft component in
that pt interval, especially for inelastic p-p collisions (the
dashed curve represents a TCM sum of soft + hard com-
ponents – see Sec. VII C). The spectrum data at 17.3
GeV then constrain only soft component ˆS0(mt; n, T ).

FIG. 12: Left: mt spectrum for identiﬁed charged pions from
17.3 GeV inelastic p-p collisions (points) [24]. The solid curve
is a ﬁt of Eq. (2) with T = 145 MeV held ﬁxed to determine
L´evy exponent n = 27. The dashed curve is a full TCM de-
termined by the parameters for that energy in Table III. The
dash-dotted curve is the corresponding Maxwell-Boltzmann
exponential. Right: Measured L´evy exponents for three col-
lision energies (solid points). The curve is motivated by the
possibility of Gribov diﬀusion controlling the growth of trans-
verse momentum for low-x partons (gluons) [25]. The open
symbols are interpolations at energies relevant to this study.

Figure 12 (right) shows soft-component exponents in
the form 1/n inferred from spectrum data for three col-
lision energies (solid points) at the SPS, RHIC and LHC
respectively. The solid curve is an algebraic hypothesis
based on variation of the soft component due to Gribov
diﬀusion [25]. Low-x gluons result from a virtual parton
splitting cascade within projectile nucleons whose mean
depth on x is determined by the collision energy. Each
step of the cascade adds transverse-momentum compo-
nents in a random-walk process. The depth of the cas-

dashed curves represent H(pt) for T0(pt) (middle) and for
T (pt) from bins A and C (lower and upper respectively). The
13 TeV soft component is represented by the dotted curve.
The dash-dotted curve represents H(pt) for 200 GeV. Right:
Fit residuals corresponding to the left panel (points). The
spectrum ratios with varying hard component for bins A and

(right). The hatched band indicates ±5% deviations.

The subtraction procedure leads to the ﬁtted 13 TeV
hard-component parameters in Table III. The soft and
hard spectrum components in the left panel are S(pt) =
¯ρs0 ˆS0(pt) (dotted curve) and H(pt) = α¯ρ2
ˆH0(pt) (mid-
s0

ponent (dash-dotted curve) is shown for comparison.
Two other dashed curves in the left panel correspond to
Eq. (15) with T0(pt) → T (pt) described by solid curves A
and C in Fig. 9 (right) leading to the dashed ratio curves
in the right panel that can be compared with data in
Fig. 3 (right). The ﬁtted ˆH0(pt) parameters for bins A
and C and the INEL > 0 reference are included in Fig. 5
(left) (labeled 13 TeV) and show variations with ¯ρs sim-
ilar to 200 GeV although over a limited ¯ρs/¯ρs0 interval.
In that ﬁgure the upper solid line is 1.43 times the lower
and the upper dashed curve has 1/3 the tanh amplitude
of the lower, both comments referring to Eqs. (8).

Those results plus previous ﬁgures in this section indi-
cate that the 13 TeV TCM with varying hard component
provides an accurate pt spectrum description over a sub-
stantial range of event multiplicities. It also buttresses
results from Ref. [1] that revealed a 200 GeV spectrum
hard component with mode near pt = 1 GeV/c and ap-
proximate power-law tail at higher pt compatible with
QCD predictions derived from reconstructed jets.

VII. pt SPECTRUM ENERGY EVOLUTION

energy variation of pt spectra between 7 and 13 TeV,
since only a spectrum ratio is provided. Supplementary

tio. The second line deﬁnes the TCM for this case and
the third line indicates a factorization similar to that in
Eq. (11). However, the ˆS0 ratio does not cancel; it is
determined instead by the exponent-n trend in Fig. 12.

rived from Fig. 4 of Ref. [9]. The low-pt limit of R(pt) is
density ratio ¯ρs2/¯ρs1 ≈ 1.125 (hatched band) compared
with expected ratio 1.10 derived from the soft-component
trend (dotted curve) in Fig. 7. This ratio of full spectra
confuses soft and hard TCM components, is insensitive
to energy-dependent jet physics obscured at lower pt by
the spectrum soft component, and the changes between 7
and 13 TeV are small as shown below. Improved sensitiv-
ity to jet physics could be obtained by analyzing spectra
from higher-multiplicity p-p collisions.

Given the soft-component energy trend derived above
the 7 TeV spectrum hard component can be isolated.

component contribution to R(pt) variation with energy.

volution of a ﬁxed p-p fragmentation-function ensemble
with a collision-energy-dependent jet spectrum [3]. The

for jets is just visible in azimuth correlations as a more
sensitive detection method [29]. The 200 GeV summary
includes parametric variation of ˆH0(yt; q, σyt) for seven
multiplicity classes (thin solid curves) as described in
Sec. IV C. Corresponding data (solid points) represent
NSD p-p collisions. The overall result is a comprehensive
and accurate description of dijet contributions to spectra
vs p-p collision energy over three orders of magnitude.

D. Spectrum TCM parameter summary

Table III summarizes p-p TCM parameters for a broad
range of energies. The entries are grouped as soft-
component parameters (T, n), hard-component param-
eters (¯yt, σyt, q), hard-soft relation parameter α and soft
density ¯ρs, with T = 145 MeV held ﬁxed for all cases.
The interpolated L´evy exponent n values are derived
from Fig. 12 (right) (open circles). The interpolated
power-law q values are derived from Fig. 14 (right) (open
circles). All ¯ρs values are derived from the universal trend
in Fig. 7 (dotted curve) inferred from correlation and
yield data. All 0.9 and 2.76 TeV values are predicted via
interpolations. The remaining (unstarred) numbers are
obtained from ﬁts to data as described above.

Figure 16 (left) shows TCM hard-component model
parameters (points) vs collision energy. The solid points
are derived from data. The open points are interpolations
or extrapolations derived from the inferred or predicted
trends in the ﬁgure (curves). The trends for ¯yt and σyt
are straight lines. Whereas σyt increases with energy by
50% the upper limit on ¯yt variation is ﬁve percent.

adjustment to ˆH0(yt) Gaussian width σyt and centroid ¯yt
were made to accommodate the data: 2.66 → 2.64 for the
centroid and 0.60 → 0.595 for the width (see Table III).

C. Energy evolution of spectrum hard component

Figure 15 (left) shows hard-component ratios for three
energy pairs, where H(pt; E) ≈ α(E)¯ρ2
s(E) ˆH0(pt; E) re-
lates hard-component yield data to unit-normal model
functions. The curves are determined by the parameters
in Table III. The 13 vs 7 TeV comparison (points) re-
veals little about the energy evolution of H(pt; E), but
the larger energy intervals demonstrate that the hard-
component width near its mode broadens signiﬁcantly,
and the high-pt power-law tail falls much less rapidly at
higher collision energies. Those trends are quantitatively
consistent with the measured p-p collision-energy depen-
dence of underlying parton/jet energy spectra [5].
Figure 15 (right) shows the ratio H(pt; E)/¯ρs(E) ≈
α(E)¯ρs(E) ˆH0(pt; E) measuring the spectrum hard com-
ponent per soft-component yield corresponding (by hy-
pothesis) to dijet production per participant low-x gluon.
The two dotted curves are for 0.9 and 2.76 TeV and
the dashed curve is for 7 TeV. Isolated hard components
rather than spectrum ratios clarify spectrum energy evo-
lution and its relation to dijet production.

The predictions for six collision energies (curves) de-
rived from parameter values in Table III are compared to
data from four energies (13, 7 and 0.2 TeV above and 0.9
TeV in the next section). The 17.3 GeV extrapolation
described below indicates no signiﬁcant jet contribution
to yields and spectra at that energy (dashed curve in

comparison suggests that FFs from p-¯p collisions, already
substantially modiﬁed (sharply reduced at lower frag-
ment momentum) in p-¯p collisions as compared to e+-e−
collisions [3], may still overestimate total fragment yields
at lower p-p collision energies by 50-100%. It is also possi-
ble that a signiﬁcant fraction of low-energy-jet fragments
falls outside a limited detector acceptance. That issue
may be closely related to factor-2 disagreements between
NLO theory predictions and measured pt spectra [31].

The TCM energy parametrization summarized in Ta-
ble III can be tested by comparison with additional data
from an intermediate energy. Reference [22] presents a pt
spectrum from 0.3M 0.9 TeV INEL p-p collisions (Fig. 3)
and corresponding multiplicity-dependent ratios (Fig. 6,

Figure 17 (left) shows spectrum data (points) derived
from Fig. 3 of Ref. [22]. The solid curve is the corre-
sponding TCM derived from the parameters in Table III
with no adjustments. Deviations of data from the TCM
are typically less than 5% over the entire pt range, as in
Fig. 11 (right), and are consistent with uncertainties in
obtaining data values from the published spectrum. Also

(points) from Fig. 6 (lower panel) of Ref. [22]. The re-
ported bin-mean nch (nacc) values for three multiplicity
bins are 3, 7 and 17. The data for central bin B convey no
signiﬁcant information (the spectra in ratio are too simi-
lar) and are omitted. The common reference for three ra-
tios is the INEL spectrum. Based on the bin-B ratio data
in Ref. [22] ¯nacc ≈ 6 is the eﬀective INEL value. Given
the asymptotic ratio limits at larger pt (dotted lines) the
eﬀective bin means should then be ¯nacc ≈ 0.35 × 6 = 2.1
(A), ≈ 1.15 × 6 ≈ 7 (B) and ≈ 2 × 6 = 12 (C).

The dashed curves (approaching the dotted lines) rep-
resent Eq. (11) with TCM parameters for 0.9 TeV and
ﬁxed ˆH0(pt) from Table III unaltered. The data descrip-
tion is good, with deviations from the TCM at larger pt
similar to those noted in Figs. 2 (left) and 8 (left). The
limited event number precludes detailed analysis of hard-
component variation with ¯ρs via spectrum ratios. The
solid curves result from q = 4.7 and 4.3 and σyt = 0.525
and 0.535 for bins A and C respectively. Those values
are consistent with interpolation of the parameter trends
in Fig. 5 (left) between 200 GeV and 13 TeV

Table 2 of Ref. [22] does provide signiﬁcant informa-
tion on spectrum multiplicity dependence in the form of
model ﬁts to spectra for various multiplicity classes. The
model function [Eq. (1) of Ref. [22]] is described as a
“modiﬁed Hagedorn function” (i.e. power-law model)

be expressed as pt0 = b T with b (∼ n) and T obtained
independently for comparison with Eq. (2). An indirect
comparison can be made between 0.9 TeV data and TCM
predictions via those ﬁt results: The same ﬁt model is
applied to the 0.9 TeV TCM deﬁned in Table III and the
parameter trends are compared with those from Ref. [22].
Figure 18 (a) shows TCM spectra based on 0.9 TeV pa-
rameters from Table III (solid curves) for 20 multiplicity
bins as deﬁned in Ref. [22]. For each corrected nch value
the corresponding ¯ρs was obtained assuming α = 0.01.
The hard-component parameters were varied consistent
with Fig. 5 (interpolated between 200 GeV and 13 TeV
trends). The power-law model Eq. (21) with parameters
(A, T, b) (dashed curves) was ﬁtted to the TCM spectra.

the form relevant to χ2 minimization. The power-law
model seems to describe the 0.9 TEV TCM adequately
(no excess beyond statistics) but the event number is
only 0.3M. For a more typical several million events the
hatched band is reduced 7-fold and the same residuals
become very signiﬁcant (see Secs. IX B, IX E and XI A).
Figure 18 (c) and (d) show ﬁt results from Table 2 of
Ref. [22] for two model parameters (open points) repre-
senting b and T ≡ pt0/b. The solid points represent ﬁts
of Eq. (21) applied to the TCM as described above. In
panel (c) the upper hatched band represents ﬁxed ˆS0(mt)
L´evy exponent n ≈ 9.8 and the lower hatched band rep-
resents ﬁxed ˆH0(yt) parameter q ≈ 4.5 (with q + 2 as the
relevant exponent for pt). As event multiplicity increases
from left to right Eq. (21) attempts to accommodate in
turn ﬁrst the soft component alone then the hard com-
ponent. In panel (d) the hatched band represents ﬁxed
ˆS0(mt) parameter T = 145 MeV. For larger multiplici-
ties the ﬁtted parameter drops away from the TCM value
as the power-law model attempts to accommodate the
increasing hard-component amplitude. The good agree-
ment between most open and solid points indicates that
the TCM is a satisfactory representation of 0.9 TeV spec-
trum data for all but the smallest multiplicities.

The data from Ref. [22] (open points) rise substantially
above ﬁts to the TCM (solid points) for the lowest multi-
plicity classes. Such diﬀerences should arise if the TCM
does not model low-pt excursions of the hard component
for smaller event multiplicities, as in Fig. 1 (right). That
similar excursions may appear over a range of collision

This comparison indicates that the overall spectrum
TCM described in the present study serves as an accurate
representation of pt spectrum data over large pt, energy
and multiplicity ranges, with isolation of two components
representing distinct hadron production mechanisms that
may be compared independently with relevant theory.

IX. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES

The main purpose of this study is to extend the p-p
pt spectrum TCM established at the RHIC to the high-
est available collision energies. Previous studies of TCM
nch dependence have been based on individual pt spec-
tra [1, 2] whereas spectrum ratios are presently available
at LHC energies as in Refs. [9, 22]. Spectrum ratios do
not clearly distinguish two dominant hadron production
mechanisms and are thus diﬃcult to parametrize accu-
rately or to interpret. However, within the TCM frame-
work spectrum ratios can be processed to isolate soft and
hard components as demonstrated in this study. In this
section the accuracy of the extended TMC is evaluated.

A. 200 GeV spectrum TCM and spectrum ratios

16

Systematic uncertainties for 200 GeV p-p pt spectra
as in Fig. 1 are described in Sec. VIII of Ref. [1]. The
most uncertain aspect of the TCM is the shape of the
low-pt part of hard component H(pt) (below the mode)
that results from subtraction of inferred model ˆS0(pt),
and the uncertainty is greatest for the lowest multiplicity
class. While adjusting the amplitude of ˆS0(pt) by a few
percent can alter the structure below the mode the result
does not match the shape variation observed there.

Given the imposed nch bins Table I uncertainties for
¯ρ0 and ¯ρs depend on the estimates for ξ = 0.66 ± 0.02
and α = 0.006 ± 0.001. The value of ξ is estimated from
the integrals of ˆS0(pt) and S(cid:48)
0(pt) (dotted curves in Fig. 1
– left) that describe the data. The value of α is derived
from an iterative process described in Refs. [1, 2] where it
s with α ≈ 0.006
was established empirically that ¯ρh = α¯ρ2
and ¯ρh is the integral of spectrum hard component H(pt).
The variations in ˆH0(pt) introduced in Sec. IV C do not
change that relation since small changes to the high-pt
tail do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the integral. Figure 4 (left)
indicates that the resulting spectrum scaling is self con-
sistent to a few percent. In that ﬁgure a small distortion
common to all nch classes and consistent with a form of
tracking error (curvature resolution) has been removed.

A new aspect of this study is the nch dependence of the
TCM hard component. The 200 GeV parameter values
in Fig. 5 (left) provide an indication of the precision. The
points represent best-ﬁts-by-eye, and the values were not
adjusted after the ﬁt procedure. Small deviations from
the simple trends in Eq. (8) suggest parameter precision
at the few-percent level. Fig. 5 (right) appears to conﬁrm
Fig. 4 (left) as to the quality of the TCM description over
a 100-fold variation in dijet production rate and ten-fold
variation in soft-hadron density.

The 200 GeV spectrum ratios are in principle precise
since pt-dependent tracking ineﬃciencies cancel and ¯ρs
is well-deﬁned. The relation of absolute spectra to the
TCM with varying hard component is suggested by Fig. 4
(left) with r.m.s. deviation 3% for n = 2-6 spectra, and
spectrum ratios as in Fig. 2 (left) appear similarly pre-
cise. However, the apparent precision can be misleading
as discussed in the next subsection and Sec. X. Spectrum
ratios alone representing only a fraction of the available
information must be supplemented by isolated spectra
as in Sec. VI C. And comparisons between models and
data must demonstrate the degree of statistical precision.
Qualitatively, the nch dependence of spectrum ratios and
the precision of inferred T (pt) for several collision sys-
tems do conﬁrm a peaked spectrum hard component with
mode near 1 GeV/c, thus buttressing results of Ref. [1].

The form ∆ρ/

In Eq. (22) the equivalent quantity for SP spectra, in-
troduced with similar structure to assess the statistical
signiﬁcance of spectrum structure, is based on the Pois-
son error expression in Eq. (23) and measures ﬁt residuals
relative to statistical errors as in Fig. 18 (b). Compar-

of the additional factors would be to reduce the scaled
residuals for the lower event classes while increasing those
for the higher, but the pt or yt structure is comparable.
In Fig. 3 (right) the nch dependence of ˆH0(yt) at higher
pt appears substantial whereas no such structure is ev-
ident in Fig. 6 of Ref. [1] describing the same collision
system. There are two reasons: (a) The event number
for Ref. [1] was 3M distributed across eleven multiplicity
classes whereas for Ref. [2] the event number is 6M dis-
tributed across seven multiplicity classes, and the accep-
tance for the former was ∆η = 1 whereas for the latter it
is ∆η = 2, the combination producing a 3-fold diﬀerence
in the spectrum r.m.s. statistical error. (b) Figure 6 of
Ref. [1] is in the form ∆ρ/
ρref whereas Fig. 3 (right) of
√
the present study is in the form ∆ρ/ρref + 1. The extra
factor 1/
ρref in the latter (varying over several orders
of magnitude) strongly suppresses deviations at lower pt
and exaggerates deviations at higher pt. Spectrum com-
parisons in the form ∆ρ/ρref may indicate a certain level
of precision but provide no indication of statistical signif-
icance. Highly signiﬁcant deviations at smaller pt or yt
may then be suppressed leading to misconceptions. Spec-
trum comparisons in the form ∆ρ/
ρref clearly reveal
statistically-signiﬁcant deviations over the full pt accep-
tance. The diﬀerences in two descriptions of the same
data may be dramatic as demonstrated in Sec. X.

√

√

In Sec. III accurate independent determination of ¯ρs
for each multiplicity class facilitated the 200 GeV analy-
sis. In order to provide equivalent information for anal-
ysis of Ref. [9] data information on multiplicity distribu-
tions from Ref. [19] was employed, speciﬁcally the NBD
parameters in Table II. The NBD ﬁts to MD data are
accurate to a few percent up to nch = 20 which includes
almost all events. Based on the multiplicity bins deﬁned
in Ref. [9] (denoted here by A, B and C) the bin means
were determined from the NBD parameters in Table II.
Figure 7 shows various charge-density measurements
vs collision energy and can be used to estimate system-
atic uncertainties. The solid dots are mean values for
several energies obtained from the NBD parameters in
Table II. They are described by the TCM trend (solid
curve) within 5% and are consistent with results from Ta-
ble 12 of Ref. [19] with 4% uncertainties. The open boxes
summarize data for three event types (INEL, NSD, INEL
> 0) from Table 7 of Ref. [19]. The combined uncertainty
is less than 3% for each point. That summary suggests
that the NBD parametrizations in Table II provide mean
values with accuracy better than 5%.

Based on the bins deﬁned in Ref. [9] and indicated in
Fig. 6 (right) the corrected bin means as nch/∆η are 3,
9 and 15 and the ensemble mean is 6.2. Bin-mean ratios
to the ensemble mean are 0.48, 1.45 and 2.4 for bins A,
B and C respectively and should be independent of eﬃ-
ciency or acceptance. Assuming ξ ≈ 0.6 for Ref. [9] data
the corresponding N acc
ch values within ∆η = 1.6 should
be approximately 3, 8.6 and 14.5 with ensemble mean
(cid:104)N acc
ch (cid:105) ≈ 6 (compared to 6.73 from Ref. [9]). The bin
means themselves are not reported in Ref. [9]

Returning to the energy trends in Fig. 7 the NBD
averages (solid dots) appear to favor the TCM trend
(solid curve) whereas direct density measurements (open
boxes) seem to favor the “power law” trend (dashed
curve). While the two data sets are consistent within
their systematic uncertainties those estimates may not
reﬂect point-to-point uncertainties that could be signiﬁ-
√
cantly smaller. MB dijet production continues to scale as
¯ρh/¯ρs ∼ log(
s/10 GeV) as low as 62 GeV [13] and pre-
sumably still depends on low-x gluon participants at that
point represented by ¯ρs. Diﬀerential spectrum analysis
at lower energies might shed light on this question.

D. 13 TeV spectrum ratios

Figure 8 (left) shows three spectrum ratios from
Ref. [9]. The ratio data should in principle be precise
due to cancellation of instrumental eﬀects but do present
certain diﬃculties. In the simpler form of Eq. (5) (fourth
line) quantity X(pt) → ¯ρsX /¯ρs0 at higher pt for bin X,
and that ratio should be accurately known to a few per-
cent. But in Fig. 8 (right) the approximate ratios are
0.25, 0.85 and 1.75 for bins A, B and C respectively where

0.48, 1.45 and 2.4 are expected. That the bin B spectrum
ratio is asymptotically less than 1 suggests that inverses
of described spectrum ratios may actually be plotted.
As demonstrated in Fig. 4 (right) the same information
should emerge from a TCM analysis in either case.

In Eq. (11) (fourth line) the asymptotic limit at lower
pt is determined by the same ratio ¯ρsX /¯ρs0 as at higher
pt, thus providing a consistency check on the data. To ob-
tain consistency the ratio for bin A was rescaled by factor
0.97 and that for bin C was rescaled by factor 1.03, both
adjustments within the systematic uncertainties (±5%)
of the spectrum data in Fig. 3 of Ref. [9]. Bin B data were
not processed further because deviations from unity (the
signiﬁcant structure) are small and quite diﬀerent from
what is observed for bins A and C and the 200 GeV data.
Those issues notwithstanding, the TCM description of
bin A and C ratio data is quite precise as indicated by
Fig. 11, the ﬁt residuals mainly within ±5% out to 10
GeV/c and consistent with individual data uncertain-
ties. The TCM description of other quantities [e.g. R(pt),
X(pt), Y (pt)] is of similar quality. The 13 TeV param-
eters extracted for the varying ˆH0(pt) model in Fig. 5
(left) show somewhat more scatter over a smaller ¯ρs in-
terval but seem consistent within a few percent.

E. TCM parameter energy systematics

Table III summarizes the TCM over a large energy
interval. The model accuracy can be assessed both by the
simplicity of parameter variations and by comparisons
with data that did not contribute to parameter inference.
The simplicity of parameter variations with collision
energy is demonstrated by Figs. 7, 12 (right), 14 (right)
and 16 (left). Except for L´evy exponent n and soft-
hard coeﬃcient α the TCM parameters vary linearly with
log(s/s0).
In Fig. 12 (right) the 1/n uncertainties are
typically the size of the solid points (17.3 GeV 5%, 200
GeV 2%, 13 TeV 3%). In Fig. 14 (right) 1/q uncertainties
are again the size of the points (about 2%). The hard-
component mode is nearly constant at ¯yt ≈ 2.6 with at
most 4% variation across all energies. One should distin-
guish between 200 GeV ﬁxed- ˆH0(pt) parameters consis-
tent with the n = 3 multiplicity class (see Fig. 5) and the
200 GeV NSD values in Table III. The ﬁxed reference for
13 TeV is based on the table values for that energy. The
values in Table III apply only to spectrum data below 10
GeV/c. For any collision energy the eﬀective power-law
parameter q is expected to increase at higher pt consis-
tent with the energy trend of underlying jet spectra [5].
The TCM can also be evaluated as a predictive model
by comparison with data not contributing to its deﬁni-
tion, as in Fig. 17 where a 0.9 TeV spectrum and spec-
trum ratios are addressed. All TCM parameters for that
energy are the result of model predictions with no ad-
justment. The description of spectrum and ratios is of
similar quality to that for 200 GeV and 13 TeV, with
spectrum residuals typically ±5% as in Fig. 11 (right).

18

Figure 18 provides detailed information on spectrum
nch dependence at 0.9 TeV in the form of power-law ﬁt
parameters for spectrum data [open points in panels (c)
and (d)]. The solid points are obtained from power-law
ﬁts to the 0.9 TCM as deﬁned by Table III and show
good agreement except for the lowest nch values. Fig-
ure 18 (b) suggests that the power-law model describes
spectrum data adequately since ﬁt residuals are consis-
tent with statistical uncertainties but that result is mis-
leading. The small number of collision events in even the
lowest nch bins translates to large statistical uncertain-
ties; the 0.9 TeV data cannot test models eﬀectively.

The 200 GeV study in Ref.

[1] was based on 3M
events distributed over eleven multiplicity classes within
∆η = 1, whereas the study in Ref. [2] and the present
analysis are based on 6M events distributed over seven
multiplicity classes within ∆η = 2. The two lowest mul-
tiplicity classes in Ref. [2] based on 6M events include
more than 2M events each as in Table I. The diﬀerence
compared to Ref. [1] is a nearly 3-fold decrease in r.m.s.
statistical errors for the present study that reveals new
details of hard-component evolution with nch (Sec. X).

The 0.9 TeV study in Ref [22] is based on less than
0.3M events, distributed over more than twenty multi-
plicity classes instead of seven. The lowest multiplicity
classes included only 40K events each (the equivalent for
Ref. [16] that introduced the power-law model was 10K
events). The overall r.m.s. statistical error is then more
than 7-fold larger than for the present study. Whereas
in the present study ﬁne details of TCM component evo-
lution are resolved [and compare Fig. 18 (b) to Fig. 23
(left)] low-statistics data as in Ref [22] provide inadequate
discriminating power for eﬀective model comparisons.

X. HARD-COMPONENT nch EVOLUTION

In Ref. [1] the principal achievement was isolation of
two spectrum components: one described by a L´evy dis-
tribution and one described as a peaked distribution with
mode near pt = 1 GeV/c approximated near the mode
by a Gaussian on yt with ﬁxed parameters. That “hard”
component was interpreted as jet-related after compari-
son with measured jet properties (FFs and jet spectrum).
It was noted that signiﬁcant deviations from the TCM
hard component occurred for the two lowest nch classes.
In the present study analysis of 200 GeV spectrum
ratios reveals a substantial systematic nch dependence at
higher yt as discussed in Sec. IV C. It is determined that
variation of hard-component parameters σyt and q as in
Fig. 5 (left) and Eq. (8) can accommodate data above the
mode. But it is also clear that deviations from the ﬁxed
model below the mode are closely related: the entire hard-
component shape is biased by a changing nch condition.
It is desirable to develop a more complete description
but the spectrum-ratio format is insensitive to deviations
below the mode as discussed in Sec. IX B – the format in
Fig. 18 (b) is more appropriate. The term “data” below

residuals for n = 2-6 are consistent with point-to-point
systematic errors (about 1 permil of data values).

A. Optimized hard component below the mode

Figure 19 (left) shows high-statistics 200 GeV p-p spec-
tra for six multiplicity classes from Ref. [2] compared in
ratio to the TCM from Table III but with varying hard
component as in Fig. 5 (left). A small distortion common
to all nch classes and consistent with a form of track-
ing error (curvature resolution) has been removed as in
Fig. 4 (left). One could conclude that the TCM data
description is good except for the lowest n = 1 multiplic-
ity class (high solid curve). However, the smooth solid
curves symmetric about unity indicate one-sigma statis-
tical errors that become very small in ratio at lower yt.
Spectrum ratios strongly suppress most information be-
low the hard-component mode.

FIG. 20: Left: The same format as Fig. 19 (right) but the
hard component has been further adjusted to accommodate
data below the hard-component mode as described in the text.
The remaining low-yt residuals are consistent with point-to-
point systematic errors. Right: Data in the left panel plotted
as conventional spectrum ratios demonstrating that impor-
tant information below 1 GeV/c is concealed by such ratios.

Figure 20 (right) shows those results in a conventional
ratio format. The residuals below the mode are no longer
visible (less than 1% in the ratio format), thus indicat-
ing the extent to which important residuals structure at
smaller yt may be concealed by the ratio format whereas
relatively minor eﬀects at larger yt may be exaggerated.

FIG. 19: Left: Spectrum ratios for six multiplicity classes
comparing 200 GeV p-p data to a TCM with hard-component
parameters varying with nch as in Fig. 5 (left). The two
smooth solid curves symmetric about unity indicate one-
sigma statistical errors. Right: The diﬀerence between spec-
trum data and the same TCM compared to statistical errors
as in Eq. (24). Above the hard-component mode near pt = 1
GeV/c residuals are consistent with statistical errors (hatched
band). Below the mode there are large systematic excursions.

√

Figure 19 (right) is equivalent in principle to the ratios
in the left panel but instead of the ∆ρ/ρref +1 form of the
ρref discussed
latter this comparison has the form ∆ρ/
in Sec. IX B and comparable to Fig. 6 of Ref. [1]. In this
format it becomes clear that the variable hard component
reduces residuals above the mode to the statistical level,
but the residuals below the mode remain very large com-
pared to statistical errors. Those residuals do not result
from free ﬁts to spectrum data. They represent substan-
tial spectrum information not accommodated within the
revised TCM derived in Sec. IV C.

Figure 20 (left) shows the result of further modiﬁca-
tion of the hard-component model. Gaussian widths σyt+
above and σyt− below the mode are treated separately.
The values given in Fig. 5 (left) and Eq. (8) are retained
for σyt+ above the mode, but the values for σyt− are var-
ied independently in the form 1/σ2
yt− to accommodate
data below the mode (except for n = 1). The resulting

hard-component mode σyt− (solid points) that accommodates
data in that yt interval, as in Fig. 20 (left). The Gaussian
width above the mode σyt+ (open points) as in Fig. 5 (left)
is included for comparison. The curves are deﬁned in the
text. The correlated variation is notable. Right: The sum of
squared deviations between model and data relative to sta-

power-law ﬁt model (open points) and TCM (solid points).

ues were determined ﬁrst from ﬁts by eye and not al-
tered after the algebraic trend was inferred. Also in-
cluded is the trend for the width above the mode σyt+

The model for class n = 1 cannot accommodate data
below the mode: the trend for 1/σ2

requires a negative entry for n = 1, and the shape of
the model function would remain very diﬀerent from the
data. The value of σyt− for n = 2 is retained for n = 1.

ferential denoted by the expression (data − TCM),

ch). Whereas full-spectrum ratios [e.g.
Fig. 20 (right)] are misleading this ratio to the hard com-
ponent alone is informative, revealing that residuals be-
tween complete spectra and a revised full TCM are less
than 10% of hard-component values for n = 2-6 over the
full yt range relevant to jet-related spectrum structure.

B. Comparisons with alternative spectrum model

Figure 23 (left) shows residuals from ﬁts to the same
spectrum data with power-law model Eq. (21) (without
prefactor pt/mt) processed in the same manner as the
TCM residuals in Fig. 20 (left). The deviations for lower
multiplicity classes are tens of statistical error bars (de-
noted by the hatched band) over the entire yt range.

Figure 23 (right) shows the same residuals in the more
conventional ratio format. The smooth solid curves sym-
metric about unity indicate one-sigma statistical errors.
The ﬁt residuals at larger yt clearly remain many times
greater than the statistical errors, but the residuals at
smaller yt are strongly suppressed by the ratio format.

Figure 21 (right) shows mean-squared values of residu-
als in Fig. 23 (left) for ﬁve multiplicity classes (open cir-
cles). The equivalent for TCM residuals in Fig. 20 (left)
are included for comparison (solid points). Those values

ted in the conventional spectrum-ratio format demonstrating

model parameters is not included in the ratio, only the
number of ﬁtted data points (23).
It could be argued
that there are more parameters for the TCM (six) than
for the power-law model (three), but the nominal number
of TCM parameters is substantially reduce by their sim-
ple algebraic trends over multiplicity classes and collision
energies. In eﬀect, a few ﬁxed model parameters are not
determined independently by free ﬁts to individual spec-
tra and they predict hundreds of data points accurately.

XI. DISCUSSION

Reference [9] mentions “rich features” exhibited by the
nch dependence of 13 TeV p-p pt spectra based on spec-
trum ratio data represented by Fig. 8 (left) of this study.
There is indeed substantial new information conveyed by
the nch systematics of pt spectra but a TCM context is
required to fully access that information. In this section
several outstanding issues are considered.

A. Utility of monolithic spectrum models

Despite substantial evidence supporting a multicom-
ponent mathematical model for pt spectra from both p-p
and A-A collisions claims persist that pt spectra can be
described accurately by a single monolithic model func-
tion interpreted variously to imply diametrically-opposed
mechanisms for hadron production. The claimed model
is the so-called power-law function Eq. (21) [33] (L´evy
distribution [26], Tsallis statistics [34]) similar to ˆS0(mt)
in Eq. (2). Given the assumption that spectra are univer-
sally well-described by that model the power-law function
is assumed to imply direct connection with a dominant
role for QCD jets [35] or for thermalization and ﬂows [36].
Reference [35] maintains that “...hadron spectra span-
ning over 14 orders of magnitude down to the lowest pT

scribed by a single nonextensive statistical mechanical
distribution that is widely used in other branches of sci-
ence. This suggests indirectly the possible dominance of
the hard-scattering process over essentially the whole pT
region at central rapidity in high energy pp and p¯p colli-
sions.” The criterion for ﬁt quality seems to be that ﬁt
residuals are small relative to the overall excursion of the
spectrum (many decades) rather than local structure and
statistical uncertainties (few percent). The most impor-
tant information carried by spectra is thereby ignored.

In Ref. [36] “Tsallis statistics” is coupled to a blast-
wave (BW) spectrum model applied to pt spectra over
some limited pt interval and intended to infer radial-ﬂow
parameters from spectrum ﬁts. It is conventionally as-
sumed that there is no jet contribution within the ﬁtted
pt interval [36]. Any deviation from an adopted refer-
ence is attributed to radial ﬂow developed during equili-
bration. Previous applications of the BW model invoked
a Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG, exponential) function as refer-
ence [37]. Any deviation from that reference, even for
p-p collisions, was interpreted to signal radial ﬂow.
In
Ref. [36] the BG reference is replaced by a power-law
function similar to Eq. (21) and ﬂow inferred in p-p colli-
sions is then reduced to zero. Interpreted in the context
of Tsallis statistics the power-law exponent measures the
extent of equilibration in a multiparticle system.

In comparisons of the TCM to a power-law or simi-
lar Tsallis model several factors are relevant: (a) Power-
law model parameters vary dramatically with nch as in
Fig. 18 whereas TCM parameters remain ﬁxed or vary
slowly and smoothly. The large power-law parameter
variations are not physically interpretable.
(b) Large
power-law residuals above yt = 3 indicate major con-
ﬂict with a spectrum shape in quantitative agreement
with published jet data and accurately represented by
√
the TCM [3–5]. (c) The relation between TCM soft and
hard components represented by α(
s) is quantitatively
consistent with jet data but has no correspondence within
the power-law model. (d) Two-particle correlation data
from high-energy collisions demonstrate a soft + hard
structure with quantitative correspondence to TCM soft
and hard spectrum components [2, 4, 13–15].

Results from the present study, and previously from
Refs. [1, 3, 12], demonstrate that a monolithic ﬁt func-
tion for pt or mt spectra is excluded by available high-
statistics spectrum data. A key issue arising from spec-
trum data is the multiplicity dependence of spectrum
shapes and the magnitude of ﬁt residuals relative to sta-
tistical errors. The results from high-statistics p-p data
in Fig. 20 compared to Fig. 23 appear to be deﬁnitive.

21

(sets of parameter values) are included. With the increas-
ing availability of high-statistics data systematic devia-
tions of many tens of statistical error bars may appear be-
tween MCs and data, indicating that such models should
be rejected. Large deviations typically persist despite ef-
forts to tune the many model parameters to accommo-
date data. The intricate structure of such models and
their many parameters make interpretation of such re-
sults diﬃcult or impossible. Reference [9] concludes that
the spectrum data are in “fair agreement” with MCs “but
not in all details.”

In contrast, the TCM provides an accurate description
of most data to their limits of statistical precision. The
separate components are individually comparable with
QCD theory (as in Ref. [3]), and the few parameters have
simple physical interpretations. Systematic variation of
model parameters over a broad range of charge multiplic-
ity and collision energy is limited, smooth and controlled
by the log(s/s0) trends expected for QCD. A TCM anal-
ysis of MC output as in Ref. [1] and the present study
could permit isolation of MC soft and hard components
for independent interpretation. And MCs oﬀer the pos-
sibility to switch oﬀ and on speciﬁc collision mechanisms
to investigate correspondence with TCM observables.

Given the TCM results from this study MC deviations
can be interpreted physically. In Fig. 5 of Ref. [9] [Fig. 8
(left) of this study] the MCs both diverge more quickly
than data from the common intercept at unity and then
saturate at larger pt whereas the data do not. The shape
of the ratio is controlled by the hard/soft ratio T (pt) =
ˆH0(pt)/ ˆS0(pt). Figure 5 of Ref. [9] then suggests that the
MC hard/soft ratio rises more quickly than data in that
pt interval. To conﬁrm that conjecture the 13 TeV TCM
was altered by shifting the centroid of ˆH0(pt) to obtain
the dash-dotted curves labeled MC in Fig. 8 (left) that
correspond well to the MC curves in Fig. 5 of Ref. [9].
The corresponding MC T0(pt) in Fig. 9 (right) conﬁrms
that the MC hard component is shifted to lower pt and
is substantially larger in amplitude than that inferred
from spectrum data, but that result was established for
PYTHIA ten years ago in Fig. 9 of Ref. [1].

This study indicates that saturation of spectrum ratios
at larger pt is consistent with a ﬁxed hard-component
shape independent of nch whereas spectrum data appear
to indicate strong bias of the underlying jet system with
increasing event multiplicity. Saturation of MC curves
is thus consistent with a ﬁxed hard-component model
exhibiting no nch bias and conﬂicting with data. Similar
MC-data conﬂicts have been encountered with angular
correlations [13] and ensemble-mean-pt trends [21, 38]

B. Monte-Carlo comparisons with data

As with most spectrum studies Ref. [9] includes com-
parisons of MC models with spectrum data in several
forms. In some cases MC results for two or more “tunes”

According to a conventional hydro narrative [39] ﬂows
may arise in nuclear collisions as a response to energy-
density gradients.
It has been argued (for A-A colli-
sions) that the total particle number (thousands) and

C. Flows in high-energy nuclear collisions

transverse energy per unit rapidity (hundreds of GeV)
imply an energy density of several GeV/fm3, suggesting
the possibility of a QCD phase transition if a thermo-
dynamic state is indeed relevant. Given those numbers
it is concluded that “one can argue for partial equilibra-
tion and the formation of collective phenomena [ﬂows]”
and “...frequent collisions occur and momentum is trans-
ferred [via ﬂows] from denser regions toward less dense
regions.” That argument relies on the pivotal assumption
that most detected hadrons are part of a “collective” sys-
tem, and substantial rescattering (“frequent collisions”)
occurs among them leading to an “energy density” in a
thermodynamic sense. Despite the initial motivating fac-
tors (large particle number and transverse energy) the
same argument has been extended to smaller systems
(e.g. S-S at the SPS in Ref. [37]) and even p-p collisions
based on recent LHC correlation data (e.g. Refs. [40, 41]).
There is growing evidence against claims for existence
of ﬂows in high-energy collisions [10, 42–46], although
some “collective” phenomena (e.g. dijets) do play a ma-
jor role. A key issue is the relevance of an energy den-
sity to nuclear collisions and the extent to which hadrons
(or partons from projectile dissociation) interact between
creation and detection. The TCM description of high-
energy nuclear collisions provides essential information.
The TCM soft component represents the majority of
hadrons in any nuclear collision. Soft-component char-
acteristics suggest that those hadrons are the result
of projectile-nucleon dissociation dominated near mid-
rapidity by low-x gluons converted to correlated charge-
neutral hadron pairs (local parton-hadron duality [47]).
The TCM soft component inferred from spectrum data
is remarkably stable relative to p-p multiplicity [1, 2] or
A-A centrality [12]. The systematic trends (e.g. persis-
tence of soft-component charge correlations) suggest that
such hadrons do not rescatter once created.

Inference of energy densities as cited above relies
on soft-component hadrons emerging from a partially
thermalized “bulk medium” (freezeout) after substan-
tial rescattering. Exponent n from power-law (Tsallis
statistics) ﬁts to spectra as in Fig. 18 (where n → b) is
said to indicate the extent of equilibration [36]. But if
the “Tsallis” exponent indicates greater equilibration as
1/n → 0 why does 1/n (1/b) increase with increasing nch
in Fig. 18? One should expect more equilibration with
higher charge densities if rescattering is relevant. If sig-
niﬁcant rescattering has not occurred the energies quoted
are simply sums of free-ﬂight kinetic energies for isolated
hadrons that have nothing to do with a thermodynamic
state. The concept of an energy density has little rele-
vance if there is eﬀectively no shared conﬁning volume.
In the present study (and Refs. [1, 2]) the diﬀerential
structure of pt spectra is determined to the statistical
limits of spectrum data.
If hydro ﬂows were relevant
one should expect a manifestation of radial ﬂow as a de-
viation of pt spectra from some nonﬂow reference (e.g.
according to the blast-wave model [36]). If hydro ﬂows
are a response to energy-pressure gradients, and energy

22

densities correspond to particle densities, there should be
a substantial response from (increase of) radial ﬂow with
increasing charge multiplicity. We observe from TCM
analysis a hard component consistent in many ways with
jet production expected from QCD theory and quantita-
tively consistent with measured jet characteristics. There
is no evidence within spectrum data for a hydro compo-
nent to p-p collisions. That situation persists in more-
peripheral A-A collisions [10, 13], and it can be argued
that even in the most central A-A collisions a jet-related
hard component plays a major role, although substan-
tially modiﬁed relative to in-vacuum jets [3, 12].

D. Universal TCM for p-p hadron production

The TCM provides a unifying description of two dis-
tinct hadron production mechanisms in high-energy nu-
clear collisions and as such is required by a large body
of data, of which the present study and Ref. [9] provide
examples. The two elements of the TCM near η = 0,
intimately related to the QCD structure of projectile nu-
cleons (parton distribution function), represent projectile
dissociation and large-angle parton scattering followed by
dijet formation. The TCM as invoked in this study ap-
plies to yields and spectra near midrapidity. As reported
in Ref. [2] accurate description of 2D angular correlations
requires a third (nonjet-quadrupole) element.

The few TCM parameters have simple and intercon-
nected energy and multiplicity dependences permitting
accurate parameter prediction by interpolation and ex-
trapolation, as in Figs. 5 (left), 12 (right), 14 (right)
and 16 (left) and as summarized in Table III. Energy
dependence relates to log(s/s0) with
s0 = O(10 GeV)
representing a kinematic limit on dijet production from
low-x gluons. Hard and soft components are directly con-
nected by the empirical relation ¯ρh ≈ α(
s, and there
is quantitative correspondence between spectrum hard
components and eventwise-reconstructed jets [3, 4].

XII. SUMMARY

A two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of
hadron production near midrapidity from high-energy
p-p collisions was derived previously from the charge-
multiplicity nch dependence of pt spectra from 200 GeV
p-p collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC).
In the present study I infer the energy dependence of
the spectrum TCM using p-p spectrum data from the
large hadron collider (LHC). Spectrum nch dependence
at higher energies has been presented recently in the form
of spectrum ratios that retain only partial information
about spectrum structure. To extrapolate the TCM to
LHC energies new analysis techniques are required.

The LHC ratio method is applied to high-statistics
RHIC spectrum data for which spectrum structure is well
understood. A method is devised to derive TCM soft and
hard components individually from spectrum ratios. The
same methods are applied to LHC spectrum ratios to de-
rive separate soft and hard components for those spectra.
The energy dependence of soft and hard TCM spec-
trum components is determined accurately from just
above 10 GeV to 13 TeV, an energy interval within which
low-x gluons play a major role in hadron production at
mid-rapidity. The newly-observed energy evolution of
the soft component, modeled by a L´evy distribution on
transverse mass mt, suggests that the growth of soft-
component pt ﬂuctuations (measured by L´evy exponent
n in the form 1/n) may be determined by Gribov diﬀu-
sion. The energy dependence of hard-component param-
eters is based on QCD parameter log(s/s0) as expected
for jet-related structure. Energy trends observed at the
RHIC extrapolate to LHC energies in a manner consis-

23

tent with trends for event-wise-reconstructed jet spectra.

The 200 GeV TCM hard component was previously as-
sumed to be approximately independent of nch. Reanal-
ysis of high-statistics spectrum data in the present study
reveals that the entire hard-component shape varies sys-
tematically with nch and the variation is described by
simple parametrizations. The peaked hard-component
model with mode near pt = 1 GeV/c is observed to
broaden above the mode and narrow below the mode with
increasing nch, suggesting that imposition of a condition
on event multiplicity biases the underlying jet spectrum:
larger nch requires a harder jet spectrum with greater
fragment yield. The present analysis reveals similar evo-
lution of the hard-component shape at 13 GeV, and low-
statistics data at 0.9 TeV are consistent with that trend.

Although TCM components can be recovered from
spectrum ratios using the techniques developed in this
study ratio methods are problematic for several reasons.
(a) Spectrum ratios alone can only deﬁne a hard/soft ra-
tio of TCM components: At least one complete spectrum
must be introduced to achieve separation.
(b) Absent
a TCM context spectrum ratios cannot be interpreted
physically because they confuse at least two hadron pro-
duction mechanisms.
(c) Spectrum ratios tend to ex-
aggerate structure at higher pt and suppress important
structure at lower pt where most jet fragments appear.
(d) In conventional data/model ratio comparisons sig-
niﬁcant model discrepancies at lower pt are suppressed.
Direct comparison of data-model diﬀerences to statisti-
cal errors over the largest possible pt interval is essential.
The nch dependence of a popular Monte Carlo model
in ratio with 13 TeV spectrum data is consistent with a
ﬁxed hard component that diﬀers substantially from data
(larger jet fragment contribution peaking at lower pt).

The issue of model uniqueness is explored by di-
rect comparison with a popular “power-law” or “Tsallis-
statistics” monolithic spectrum model similar to the soft-
component L´evy distribution incorporated in the TCM.
Data-model deviations for the power-law model are many
tens of statistical error bars over a large pt interval and
the TCM is deﬁnitively favored in that case. More gener-
ally the TCM provides interpretability and explanatory
power, quantitative links to data manifestations from a
variety of collision systems and direct links to QCD the-
ory not provided by any other current data model.
