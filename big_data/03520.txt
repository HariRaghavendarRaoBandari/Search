Abstract

n

Cyclic and self-dual codes are important classes of codes in coding
theory. Jia, Ling and Xing [5] as well as Kai and Zhu [7] proved that
Euclidean self-dual cyclic codes of length n over Fq exist if and only if n is
even and q = 2r, where r is any positive integer. For n and q even, there
always exists an [n, n
2 ] self-dual cyclic code with generator polynomial
2 + 1 called the trivial self-dual cyclic code. In this paper we prove the
x
existence of nontrivial self-dual cyclic codes of length n = 2ν
·n, where n is
odd, over F2r in terms of the existence of a nontrivial splitting (Z, X0, X1)
of Zn by µ−1, where Z, X0, X1 are unions of 2r-cyclotomic cosets mod n.
We also express the formula for the number of cyclic self-dual codes over
F2r for each n and r in terms of the number of 2r-cyclotomic cosets in X0
(or in X1).

We also look at Hermitian self-dual cyclic codes and show properties
which are analogous to those of Euclidean self-dual cyclic codes. That is,
the existence of nontrivial Hermitian self-dual codes over F22ℓ based on
the existence of a nontrivial splitting (Z, X0, X1) of Zn by µ−2ℓ , where
Z, X0, X1 are unions of 22ℓ-cyclotomic cosets mod n. We also determine
the lengths at which nontrivial Hermitian self-dual cyclic codes exist and
the formula for the number of Hermitian self-dual cyclic codes for each n.

1 Introduction

Cyclic codes have been widely studied and have found numerous applications in
storage and communication systems due to the ease in their encoding/decoding.
Both ﬁnite ﬁelds and rings have been considered as “alphabets” in the construc-
tion of cyclic codes. In this study, we focus on cyclic codes over ﬁnite ﬁelds.

For a code C of length n and dimension k, denoted as an [n, k] code over
a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq (q a power of a prime), its dual code, C⊥ is deﬁned to be
{x ∈ Fn
q |x · c = 0 for all c ∈ C}. C⊥ is an [n, n − k] code. A code is said to be
Euclidean self-dual if and only if C = C⊥.

One method of constructing self-dual codes from cyclic codes is by extending
cyclic codes whose length n and the characteristic of the ﬁeld Fq are relatively
prime. Smid [11] showed that if an extended cyclic code is self-dual, then this
cyclic code is a duadic code with splitting given by µ−1. Ocampo [8] has gen-
eralized this to group codes (of which cyclic codes are a subclass) and similarly
showed that for a group code C, an ideal in the group ring Fq2[G∗], the extended

group code eC is Euclidean self-dual if and only if C is a split group code for some

splitting (Z = {0}, X0, X1) of G by µ−1.

The other method for constructing self-dual cyclic codes considers cyclic
codes of even length. In 1983, Sloane [10] noticed that extensive research have
been done regarding self-dual codes but cyclic self-dual codes in particular have
not received much attention. He showed that the number of distinct cyclic
self-dual binary codes of length 2ab (b odd) depends on the number of pairs
of asymmetric cyclotomic cosets modulo b. Jia et al.
[7]
generalized this to cyclic codes over Fq. They proved that self-dual cyclic codes
of length n over Fq exist if and only if q is power of 2 and n is even. In particular,
n and q are not relatively prime. This condition gives rise to repeated-root cyclic
codes.

[5] and Kai et al.

Repeated-root cyclic codes were ﬁrst studied by Castagnoli et al.

[1] and
van Lint [12]. van Lint focused on binary cyclic codes of length 2n (n odd)
obtained by the |u|u + v| construction. He showed that using this construction,
an inﬁnite sequence of optimal cyclic codes with distance 4 can be obtained.
Furthermore, these codes require low complexity decoding methods. On the
other hand, Castagnoli et al. derived a parity check matrix and gave a formula
for the minimum distance of repeated-root cyclic codes. They were able to ﬁnd
several repeated-root binary cyclic codes that contain the maximum number
of codewords among all known binary codes of the same length and minimum
distance. However, they have also demonstrated that repeated root cyclic codes
are not better than general cyclic codes of the same length. Inspite of this, it is
still worthwhile to study repeated-root cyclic codes under which self-dual cyclic
codes of even length are classiﬁed.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give the notations that
will be used in this paper and review some basic concepts regarding cyclic codes.
The reader is referred to Huﬀman and Pless [4] for a more detailed discussion of
cyclic codes. In Section 3, we focus on Euclidean self-dual cyclic codes over F2r .

2

We look at previous results and use q-cyclotomic cosets mod n and splittings
of Zn to determine the existence of nontrivial self-dual cyclic codes. We then
obtain analogous statements in Section 4 for Hermitian self-dual cyclic codes
over F22ℓ.

2 Notations and Basic Concepts

A cyclic code C is a linear code of length n over a ﬁeld Fq, where q is a power
of a prime such that if c = c0c1 · · · cn−1 ∈ C, then its right cyclic shift c =
cn−1c0 · · · cn−2 is also an element of C. We consider the bijective correspondence
between vectors c = c0c1 · · · cn−1 in Fn
q and polynomials c(x) = c0+c1+· · ·+cn−1
in Fq[x] of degree at most n − 1. The codeword c cyclically shifted one to the
right can be represented by x · c(x) = cn−1 + c0x + · · · + cn−2xn−1 where we
have set xn = 1. Hence, the study of cyclic codes is equivalent to the study of
the residue class ring Fq[x]/(xn − 1). The study of ideals in this residue class
ring hinges on factoring xn − 1. Following the result of Jia et al. (Theorem 1 of
[5]), we shall consider cyclic codes of even length throughout this paper. That
is, let n = 2ν · n, where n is odd, and ν is a positive integer.

To obtain the irreducible factors of xn − 1, we recall the concept of q-
cyclotomic cosets. Let a be a non-negative integer, 0 ≤ a < n, and gcd(q, n) = 1,
the q-cyclotomic coset of a modulo n is the set

Ca = {a, aq, aq2, . . . , aqr−1}

where each element is computed modulo n, r is the smallest positive integer
such that aqr ≡ a mod n, and a is usually taken as the smallest number in
the set. Note that the distinct q-cyclotomic cosets mod n partition the set
{0, 1, . . . , n − 1}.

Suppose t = ordn(q), i.e. t is the smallest positive integer such that qt ≡ 1
mod n. If α is a primitive nth root of unity in Fqt , then the minimal polyno-
mial of αa over Fq, is fa(x) = Qi∈Ca (x − αi). For n and q relatively prime, the

factorization of xn − 1 into pairwise-irreducible polynomials over Fq is given by

xn − 1 = Y

a∈I

fa(x),

where I is the complete set of q-cyclotomic coset representatives modulo n.
Hence

xn − 1 = [xn − 1]2ν

fa(x)2ν

= Y

a∈I

has n distinct roots with multiplicity 2ν in its splitting ﬁeld.

An [n, k] cyclic code can be described by its generator polynomial. The
generator polynomial of a code is the unique monic polynomial of degree
n − k that is a divisor of xn − 1 in Fq[x].
It is a product of the minimal
polynomials of αa where a is any element of I (deﬁned above) over Fq.

3

Suppose C is an [n, k] cyclic code with generator polynomial g(x). The

polynomial

p(x) =

xn − 1
g(x)

=

kX

i=0

pixi

is called the parity-check polynomial of C. Consequently, the generator polyno-
mial of C⊥ is deﬁned as

p∗(x) = p−1

0 xkp(x−1).

3 Self-Dual Cyclic Codes

[5] and Kai et al.

Jia et al.
[7] proved that there exists at least one self-dual
cyclic code of length n over Fq if and only if q is a power of 2 and n is even.
This code is the [n, n
2 ] trivial self-dual cyclic code and has generator polynomial
x
2 + 1. Our aim is to determine the conditions under which nontrivial self-dual
cyclic codes exist.

n

Let f (x) be a polynomial in Fq[x]. The reciprocal polynomial of f (x) is

the polynomial

f ∗(x) = f −1

0

· xdegf · f (x−1) = f −1

0 (fk + fk−1x + · · · + f0xk),

where f0 is the constant term of the polynomial f (x). f (x) is called a self-
reciprocal polynomial if f (x) = f ∗(x).

It is known that if αa, αqa, . . . , αqka are the nonzero roots of f in some
extension ﬁeld of Fq, then α−a, α−qa, . . . , α−qka are the nonzero roots of f ∗
If f (x) is irreducible over Fq, so is f ∗(x). Hence,
in that extension ﬁeld.
if fa(x) = Qi∈Ca(x − αi) is the minimal polynomial of αa over Fq, then its

reciprocal polynomial is

a (x) = Y

f ∗

i∈Ca

(x − α−i) = Y

i∈C−a

(x − αi) = f−a(x).

This implies that if Ca is the q-cyclotomic coset that corresponds to the minimal
polynomial fa(x) then C−a is the q-cyclotomic coset that corresponds to its
reciprocal polynomial f ∗
a (x). Note that C−a = µ−1Ca, where the multiplier
µ−1 is deﬁned by iµ−1 ≡ −i mod n for each i in {0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1}.

For n = 2ν · n and q = 2r, where n, q are relatively prime, xn + 1 can be

written as a product of distinct irreducible polynomial factors as [5]

xn + 1 = f1(x) · · · fs(x)h1(x)h∗

1(x) · · · ht(x)h∗

t (x),

where the fi(x)’s are monic, irreducible, self-reciprocal polynomials over F2r
and hj(x), h∗
j (x) form a pair of reciprocal polynomials which are also monic and
irreducible over F2r . Hence,

xn + 1 = (xn + 1)2ν

= f1(x)2ν

· · · fs(x)2ν

h1(x)2ν

1(x)2ν
h∗

· · · ht(x)2ν

t (x)2ν
h∗

.

4

Theorem 2 of [5] states that if xn + 1 is factorized as above, a cyclic code
of length n is self-dual over F2r if and only if its generator polynomial is of the
form

g(x) = f1(x)2ν−1

· · · fs(x)2ν−1

h1(x)β1 h∗

1(x)2ν −β1 · · · ht(x)βt h∗

t (x)2ν −βt

where 0 ≤ βi ≤ 2ν for each 1 ≤ i ≤ t.

Note that using this factorization, the generator polynomial of the trivial

self-dual cyclic code can be written as

n

2 + 1 = f1(x)2ν−1

· · · fs(x)2ν−1

h1(x)2ν−1

x

1(x)2ν−1
h∗

· · · ht(x)2ν−1

t (x)2ν−1
h∗

.

It was earlier noted that the fi(x)’s, hj(x)’s, h∗

j (x)’s are minimal polynomials
that correspond to some q-cyclotomic coset Ci, Cj , and C−j respectively. Thus,
aside from studying the factors of xn −1, we can look at the 2r-cyclotomic cosets
mod n in the characterization of self-dual cyclic codes.

Deﬁnition 3.1 [3] Let gcd(q, n) = 1. A splitting of Zn by the multiplier
µb, b 6= 0 is a triple (Z, X0, X1) which satisﬁes the following conditions:

1. Z, X0, X1 are unions of q-cyclotomic cosets mod n such that Zn = Z ∪

X0 ∪ X1 and Z ∩ X0 ∩ X1 = ∅.

2. µb(Z) = Z, µb(X0) = X1 and µb(X1) = X0.

We say that a splitting is trivial if X0 and X1 are both empty.

Proposition 3.2 Let gcd(q, n) = 1. In the factorization of xn − 1 over Fq,
there exists at least one pair of reciprocal, monic, irreducible polynomials if and
only if there exists a nontrivial splitting (Z, X0, X1) of Zn by µ−1 and each
q-cyclotomic coset in Z is ﬁxed set-wise by µ−1.

Proof Suppose that over Fq, xn−1 factors into f1(x) · · · fs(x)h1(x)h∗
1(x) . . . hℓ(x)
ℓ (x), where ℓ ≥ 1, the fk(x)′s are monic, irreducible, and self-reciprocal, while
h∗
hj(x) and h∗
j (x) for 1 ≤ j ≤ ℓ comprise a pair of reciprocal polynomials which are
monic and irreducible. Let C1, . . . , Cs be the q-cyclotomic cosets which corre-
spond to the minimal polynomials f1(x), . . . , fs(x) respectively. Since the fi(x)’s
are self-reciprocal, µ−1Ck = Ck for all k = 1, . . . , s. Take Z = C1 ∪ · · · ∪ Cs.

On the other hand, h∗
j (x) is the reciprocal polynomial of hj(x), where
h∗
j (x) 6= hj(x). Hence, h∗
j (x) = h−j(x) and µ−1Cj = C−j, j 6= −j. Take
X0 = ∪jCj and X1 = ∪jC−j. Since j ≥ 1, we obtain a nontrivial splitting
(Z, X0, X1) of Zn by µ−1.

Conversely, suppose there exists a nontrivial splitting of Zn by µ−1. That

is,

{0, 1, . . . , n − 1} = Z ∪ X0 ∪ X1 s.t. Z ∩ X0 ∩ X1 = ∅

5

and

X0, X1 6= ∅, µ−1X0 = X1, µ−1X1 = X0

where Z, X0, X1 are unions of q-cyclotomic cosets modulo n, and each q cyclo-
tomic coset in Z is ﬁxed set wise by µ−1. Let Z = Cz1 ∪ · · · ∪ Czk for some
k ≥ 1. Since µ−1Czi = Czi for i = 1, . . . , k, the corresponding minimal polyno-
mials f0(x), fz1 (x), . . . , fzk (x) are self-reciprocal .

Since X0 and X1 are both non-empty, there exists at least one q-cyclotomic
coset in X0 and X1. Suppose X0 = ∪j Cj for j ≥ 1. Then µ−1X0 = X1 implies
X1 = ∪j C−j. For j ≥ 1, let hj(x) be the minimal polynomial which corresponds
to Cj and h−j(x) to C−j . But, h−j(x) = h∗
j (x) for each j. Hence, hj(x) and
h−j(x) form a pair of reciprocal polynomials in the factorization of xn − 1. (cid:3)

This proposition and the factorization condition given by Jia et al. (Theorem 2
of [5]) lead to the following statement.

Theorem 3.3 A nontrivial Euclidean self-dual cyclic code C of length n = 2ν ·n
over F2r exists if and only if there exists a nontrivial splitting (Z, X0, X1) of Zn
by µ−1 where each q-cyclotomic coset in Z is ﬁxed set-wise by µ−1.

We can then restate Corollary 1 of [5] using q-cyclotomic cosets modulo n
and the splitting (Z, X0, X1) as follows. (Note that this is similar to Theorem
5 of [9]).

Corollary 3.4 For n = 2ν · n, r > 0, the number of [n, n
over F2r is exactly

2 ] self-dual cyclic codes

(2ν + 1)t

where t is the number of 2r-cyclotomic cosets in X0 (or in X1).

Next, we want to determine the lengths n for which nontrivial self-dual cyclic
codes over F2r exist. Kai et al. [7] has proved a similar theorem. We will present
an alternate proof using the splittings of Zn by µ−1 described earlier. We ﬁrst
state the following lemma.

Lemma 3.5 For n odd, let Zn be partitioned into C0, . . . , Cℓ where each Ci is
a q-cyclotomic coset modulo n. Then, for all a 6= −a in {1, ..., ℓ}, Ca = C−a if
and only if qk ≡ −1 mod n for any positive integer k.

Proof Suppose a 6= −a and Ca = C−a. Then, {a, qa, q2a, . . . , qm−1a} =
{−a, q(−a), q2(−a), . . . , qm−1(−a)}. This implies that there exists k, 1 ≤ k ≤

m − 1 such that a ≡ qk(−a) mod n. Hence, qk ≡ −1 mod (cid:16)

gcd(a,n)(cid:17). Taking

n

a = 1, we have C1 = C−1 if and only if qk ≡ −1 mod n. Then Cj = C−j
for j = 1, . . . , ℓ since qk ≡ −1 mod n implies jqk ≡ −j mod n. Conversely, if
qk ≡ −1 mod n then aqk ≡ −a mod n. Hence Ca = C−a for all a = 1, . . . , ℓ. (cid:3)

6

Theorem 3.6 Nontrivial Euclidean self-dual cyclic codes of length n = 2ν · n
(ν ∈ Z+, n odd) over F2r , r ∈ Z+ exist if and only if 2rk 6≡ −1 mod n for all
positive integers k.

Proof Suppose C is a nontrivial Euclidean self-dual cyclic code of length n over
F2r . By Theorem 3.3, there exists a nontrivial splitting (Z, X0, X1) of Zn by
µ−1 and so X0 = ∪jCj, for j ≥ 1. By Deﬁnition 3.1, µ−1(X0) = µ−1(∪jCj ) =
∪jC−j = X1 where X0 ∩ X1 = ∅. Then, Cj 6= C−j for at least one j. Using
Lemma 3.5, we conclude that 2rk 6≡ −1 mod n for all k ∈ Z+. The converse is
proved similarly.

4 Hermitian Self-Dual Cyclic Codes

We now consider cyclic codes over Fq2 , where q is a power of a prime p. Let
x = (x0, x1, . . . , , xn−1) and y = (y0, y1, . . . , , yn−1) be vectors in Fn
q2 . Consider
the involution¯: a 7→ aq deﬁned on Fq2 . The Hermitian scalar product of x and
y is deﬁned to be x · y = Pn−1

i=0 xiyi = Pn−1

i=0 xiyq
i .

Let C be an [n, k] cyclic code over Fn

q2. The Hermitian dual of C is the set
q2 |u · w = 0 for all w ∈ C}. We say that a code C is Hermitian

C⊥H = {u ∈ Fn
self-dual if C = C⊥H .

We extend the involution map to polynomials in Fq2 [x]. For f (x) = f0 +
f1x + · · · + fn−1xn−1in Fq2 [x], we set f (x) = f0 + f1x + · · · + fn−1xn−1. Let f (x)
be a polynomial in Fq2 [x] and f ∗(x) its reciprocal polynomial as deﬁned earlier.
The conjugate reciprocal polynomial of f (x) is denoted as f †(x) and is equal to
f ∗(x). f (x) is said to be self-conjugate reciprocal if f (x) = f †(x). Otherwise,
f (x) and f †(x) form a conjugate-reciprocal pair.

Let C be a nonzero [n, k] cyclic code over Fq2 generated by g(x).

If p(x)
is the parity-check polynomial of C, then the generator polynomial of C⊥H is
p†(x). Hence C is Hermitian self-dual if and only if g(x) = p†(x).

Jitman et al. [6] have shown that Hermitian self-dual abelian codes in Fq2 [G]
(char Fq2 = p; order of the ﬁnite abelian group G = mpk, p ∤ m) exist if and only
if p = 2 and k ≥ 1. We only consider the cyclic case i.e., Hermitian self-dual
cyclic codes over Fq2 exist if and only if q = 22ℓ and n is even. A Hermitian
self-dual cyclic code over this ﬁeld of length n and dimension n/2 can always
be constructed. Let xn − 1 = xn + 1 = (xn/2 + 1)2. Take g(x) = xn/2 + 1. The
parity check polynomial, p(x) = xn/2 + 1 = p∗(x) = p†(x). Hence, the code
generated by g(x) = xn/2 + 1 is not only Euclidean self-dual but also Hermitian
self-dual.
It will also be referrred to as the trivial Hermitian self-dual cyclic
code.

Consequently, in this section, we will consider codes of even length, n = 2ν ·n
over F22ℓ and characterize nontrivial Hermitian self-dual cyclic codes over this
ﬁeld. Note that Dicuangco et al.[2] have proven that for a cyclic code C over
Fq2 of odd length, the extended code is Hermitian self-dual if and only if C is
an odd-like duadic code split by µ−q. We use Theorem 3.9 in [6] as a lemma to

7

prove the existence of nontrivial Hermitian self-dual cyclic of length n over F22ℓ
using splittings of Zn.

Lemma 4.1 (Theorem 3.9, [6]) Let n = 2ν · n where ν is a positive integer and
n is odd. Over F22ℓ[x], let xn + 1 be factored as

xn + 1 = [xn + 1]2ν

= hf1(x) . . . fs(x)h1(x)h†

1(x) . . . ht(x)h†

t (x)i2ν

where the f ′
i s are monic, irreducible, self-conjugate reciprocal polynomials and
hj, h∗
j which are also monic and irreducible form a conjugate-reciprocal pair for
1 ≤ j ≤ t. A cyclic code C of length n is Hermitian self-dual over F22ℓ if and
only if its generator polynomial is of the form

g(x) = f 2ν−1

1

(x) . . . fs(x)2ν−1

where 0 ≤ γi ≤ 2ν for each i.

h1(x)γ1 h†

1(x)2ν −γ1 . . . hγi

t (x)h†

t (x)2ν −γi

We now discuss the relationship between 22ℓ-cyclotomic cosets and conjugate-

reciprocal polynomials. For a polynomial fa(x) in F22ℓ[x] where fa(x) = Qi∈Ca(x−
αi) and Ca = {a, 22ℓa, . . . , 22ℓra} is the 22ℓ-cyclotomic coset containing a, the
nonzero roots of fa(x) in some extension ﬁeld of F22ℓ are αa, . . . , α22ℓr a. Using
the deﬁnition of the conjugate-reciprocal polynomial and involution in F22ℓ[x],
we can write

a(x) = f −2ℓ
f †

0 xk Y

i∈Ca

(x−1 − α2ℓi) = Y

i∈Ca

(x − α−2ℓi) = Y

i∈C(−2ℓ a)

(x − αi).

Hence, if the 22ℓ-cyclotomic coset Ca corresponds to the minimal polynomial
fa(x) in F22ℓ, then C(−2ℓa) = µ(−2ℓ)Ca corresponds to the conjugate-reciprocal
polynomial of fa(x) which is f †

a(x).

We can use this property to prove the following proposition in a manner
similar to the proof of Proposition 3.2 but instead of reciprocal polynomials,
we use conjugate-reciprocal polynomials and instead of a splitting by µ−1, we
consider the splitting by µ−2ℓ.

Proposition 4.2 In the factorization of xn − 1 over F22ℓ, there exists at least
one pair of conjugate-reciprocal, monic, irreducible polynomials if and only if
there exists a nontrivial splitting (Z, X0, X1) of Zn by µ−2ℓ and each 22ℓ-cyclotomic
coset in Z is ﬁxed set-wise by µ−2ℓ.

The following theorem which is analogous to Theorem 3.3 can be shown to be
true by using Proposition 4.2 instead of Proposition 3.2 in the proof.

Theorem 4.3 A nontrivial Hermitian self-dual cyclic code C of length n = 2ν ·n
(ν ∈ Z+, n odd) over F22ℓ exists if and only if there exists a nontrivial splitting
(Z, X0, X1) of Zn by µ−2ℓ and each 22ℓ-cyclotomic coset in Z is ﬁxed setwise by
µ−2ℓ.

8

A corollary to this gives the number of Hermitian self-dual cyclic codes over
F22ℓ.

Corollary 4.4 For n = 2ν · n, the number of [n, n
codes over F22ℓ is exactly

2 ] Hermitian self-dual cyclic

(2ν + 1)t

where t is the number of 22ℓ-cyclotomic cosets in X0 (or in X1).

We can also determine the lengths n for which nontrivial Hermitian self-dual

cyclic codes over F22ℓ exist as follows.

Lemma 4.5 For q = 2ℓ and n odd, let Zn be partitioned into C0, . . . , Cj where
each Ci is a q2-cyclotomic coset modulo n. Then, for all a 6= −a in {1, ..., j},
Ca = C−qa if and only if q2k+1 ≡ −1 mod n for any positive integer k.

n. That is, q2k+1 ≡ −1 mod (cid:16)

Proof Let C0, . . . , Cj be the q2-cyclotomic cosets mod n. Suppose Ca = C−qa.
Then, {a, q2a, . . . , q2(m−1) · a} = {−qa, −q3a, . . . , −q · q2(m−1) · a}. This implies
that there exists k ∈ Z where 1 ≤ k ≤ m − 1 such that a ≡ q2k · −qa mod
If a = 1, C1 = C−1 if and only if
q2k+1 ≡ −1 mod n. Then Ci = C−qi for i = 1, . . . , j since q2k+1 ≡ −1 mod n
implies iq2k+1 ≡ −i mod n. Conversely, if q2k+1 ≡ −1 mod n then aq2k+1 ≡ −a
mod n. Hence Ca = C−qa for all a = 1, . . . , j.
(cid:3)

gcd(a,n)(cid:17).

Using this lemma instead of Lemma 3.5 in the proof of Theorem 3.6, we can
show that the following theorem holds.

Theorem 4.6 Nontrivial Hermitian self-dual cyclic codes of length n = 2ν · n
(ν ∈ Z+, n odd) over F22ℓ exist if and only if 2ℓ(2k+1) 6≡ −1 mod n for all positive
integers k.

Table 1 shows the values of n for which nontrivial Hermitian self-dual cyclic
codes over F4 exist and the number of Hermitian self-dual codes (including the
trivial Hermitian self-dual code) for each n computed using Corollary 4.4. Here,
n = 2ν · n where n is odd and t = number of 4-cyclotomic cosets in X0 (or
X1). The highest minimum distance (HMinD) of the cyclic code of length n for
n ≤ 100 was computed using MAGMA.
