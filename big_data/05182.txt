Gauging is a ubiquitous tool in many-body physics. It allows one to construct highly entangled
topological phases of matter from relatively simple phases and to relate certain characteristics of the
two. Here we develop a gauging procedure for general submanifold symmetries of Pauli Hamiltoni-
ans, including symmetries of fractal type. We show a relation between the pre- and post- gauging
models and use this to construct short range entangled phases with fractal like symmetries, one of
which is mapped to the cubic code by the gauging.

INTRODUCTION

The study of topological order [1, 2] intertwines many
rich areas of physics; strongly correlated quantum many-
body condesed matter systems [3, 4], quantum codes [5–
7], topological quantum ﬁeld theory (TQFT) [8–10] and
modular tensor categories [11] (and their higher cate-
gorical generalizations [12–14]). By viewing the same
physics through these complementary lenses valuable in-
sights have been gained.

In 2D a concise and deep understanding of topolog-
ical order has solidiﬁed in terms of the theory of any-
onic excitations [3, 15–21] described mathematically by
modular tensor categories [11] known to be equivalent to
(3-2-1)-extended topological quantum ﬁeld theories [22].
The theory of stabilizer codes in 2D is also well under-
stood [23, 24]. It is known that all 2D stabilizer Hamil-
tonians possess stringlike logical operators and hence are
not self-correcting quantum memories at ﬁnite temper-
ature [25], and furthermore that they are equivalent to
some number of copies of the toric code [26, 27].

In 3D the landscape of possibilities remains shrouded
in mystery. Progress has been made with the develop-
ment of novel tools such as the 3-loop braiding statis-
tics [28] (which primarily apply to gauge theories with a
possible anomolous 2D topological boundary [29]) but a
general understanding is still lacking. On the other hand
novel contributions have been made in assessing the pos-
sibility of self-correcting 3D quantum memories [30–32]
but a deﬁnitive consensus has not been reached. Most
signiﬁcantly this search has revealed models [31, 33] that
satisfy conventional deﬁnitions of topological order and
stability and yet are not described by any (conventional)
TQFT. Rather than being ﬁxed points under real space
blocking renormalization group ﬂow they may bifurcate
into multiple copies of themselves [34].

The idea of gauging pervades the literature on topo-
logical order in condensed matter systems [35–38]. This
process makes global symmetries local while allowing one
to relate certain physical properties of the pre- and post-
gauged systems [37–39]. This is most commonly applied
to a truly global and on site symmetry, although it has
also been adapted to higher form symmetries [40, 41] that
are important in the classiﬁcation of higher dimensional
phases [14, 42].

In this note we develop a framework for gauging sub-

manifold symmetries, including those of fractal type, us-
ing the language of translationally invariant stabilizers
Hamiltonians [43–45]. We demonstrate relations between
physical characteristics of the pre- and post- gauged mod-
els. Our formalism includes exotic examples such as
Haah’s cubic code [31] and more conventional examples
such as generalized toric codes. We furthermore use our
tools to construct novel cluster states with fractal type
symmetries.

II. BACKGROUND

In this section we recount several basic notions

from [44, 45].

Our focus is on Pauli Hamiltonians that are local,
translation invariant and consist of a sum of terms that
are each tensor products of exclusively Pauli X or Z ma-
trices (We shall loosen the last requirement somewhat in
the next section). We use the language of polynomials
developed by Haah in [44, 45] as it provides a succinct
description of the operators in this setting.
In Haah’s
formalism a Pauli operator is speciﬁed by a column of
polynomials over Z2. For a translationally invariant sys-
tem with d spatial dimensions each lattice site is speciﬁed
by a vector i ∈ Zd, when there are Q qubits per site a sin-
gle qubit is speciﬁed by (i, q). A general Pauli operator
is mapped to a column of length 2Q with a multivariate
polynomial over Z2 in each entry as follows

Oi,q

X

pq
i

i,qOi,q

Z

rq
i

i,q 7→ p
r!

(1)

where p = (p1, . . . , pQ) is a column consisting of entries
pq which are multivariate polynomials over Z2 whose xi
coeﬃcient is given by pq
i ∈ {0, 1} (we are using multi-
index notation).

For example on a two dimensional

lattice with
two types of qubits
the operator
X(0,0),rX(0,1),rX(1,1),bZ(1,0),r is speciﬁed by the polyno-
mial (1 + y, xy, x, 0) as shown in the following ﬁgure.

symplectic inner product is zero, i.e.

"(cid:16)¯sT ¯vT(cid:17) λQ p

(3)

where λQ := (ZX) ⊗ 11Q is the relevant symplectic form,
¯s is the antipode map (sending each monomial summand
to its inverse) and the subscript [·]0 denotes the constant
term of the polynomial. For convenience we also deﬁne
the conjugation operation (s, v)† := (¯sT ¯vT).

In Haah’s formalism the Hamiltonian is identiﬁed with
a module generated by the stabilizers on the unit cell.
More speciﬁcally let G be a free module of rank T ,
identiﬁed with the module of stabilizer position labels,
and P be the module of Pauli matrices then the Hamil-
tonian module with T types of local interaction terms
{(pt, rt)}t is generated by

σ := p1 . . . pT
r1 . . . rT!

which maps σ : G → P .
Its symplectic conjugate
ǫ := σ†λQ can similarly be thought of as a map from
the Pauli module P to the virtual excitation module of
violated Hamiltonian term positions E, i.e. ǫ : P → E.
The condition that the Hamiltonian is commuting and
hence deﬁnes a stabilizer code is simply ǫσ = 0 which is
equivalent to the sequence

G

σ−−−−→ P

ǫ−−−−→ E

forming a complex. It was shown in [44, 45] that the sta-
bilizer Hamiltonian is topologically ordered if the afore-
mentioned sequence is exact.

In the case of CSS codes this complex breaks up into
a direct sum since we have σ = σX ⊕ σZ and the com-
mutation condition becomes σ†

Z σX = 0 = σ†

X σZ .

In terms of the bipartite interaction graph of the
Hamiltonian, the map σ can be thought of as mapping
from a Hamiltonian node to the qubit nodes in its sup-
port and ǫ as mapping from a qubit node to the ad-
jacent Hamiltonian nodes with which the operator an-
ticommutes. Note we in fact need to add extra struc-
ture to distinguish the X and Z terms in the interaction
graph above, alternatively if the Hamiltonian is CSS we
can consider separate X and Z interaction graphs, corre-
sponding to σX and σZ, and the only relevant operators
are then either Z or X respectively.

III. GAUGING

In this section we build up a procedure for gauging sub-
manifold symmetries and analyze the important proper-
ties of this gauging map. We start by specifying the

2

type of translationally invariant, symmetric, local Hamil-
tonians we treat. We then move on to the deﬁnition of
the gauging procedure and proofs of several results that
demonstrate its key features. Finally we describe the
relationship between the gauging procedure and transla-
tionally invariant, local, Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS)
stabilizer Hamiltonians and give a construction of cluster
state [46] models with submanifold symmetries.

A. Hamiltonian Construction

Consider a system of

freedom
(qubits) with Hilbert space Hm governed by a transla-
tionally invariant local Hamiltonian

‘matter’ degrees of

Hm =Xi Xk

hi,k

with an on-site tensor product X symmetry associated
to all closed submanifolds of some ﬁxed but arbitrary
dimension, possibly fractals with noninteger dimension
(note these manifolds appear via discretizations with a
minimum length scale cutoﬀ). Since we only consider hy-
percube local Hamiltonian terms, the X symmetry can
be speciﬁed by hypercube local constraints expressed as
products of Z ﬁelds that commute with the symmetry.
These Z constraints can be understood as locally check-
ing whether an X operator looks like a submanifold on
which it is a symmetry. A fundamental object in our
framework is the map

η : GT → P

from a free module of rank T to the Pauli module (T is
the number of independent local Z constraints).

In addition to sums and products of these Z constraint
ﬁelds, a symmetric Hamiltonian may contain arbitrary
X perturbations. There are two important irreducible
types of X ﬁelds, single site X ﬁelds and hypercube local
X ﬁelds that commute with the Z constraints. Hence the
set of symmetric ﬁeld perturbations we consider break up
into the local Z constraint ﬁelds described by η, the single
X terms described by (11Q) and possibly some additional
X ﬁelds described by a map φ that satisﬁes φ†λQη = 0,
we will largely ignore these commuting X terms for the
time being as they become trivial after gauging.

An illustrative example is a generalized toric code in d
spatial dimensions with qubits on k-cells, X stabilizers on
(k − 1)-cells and Z stabilizers on (k + 1)-cells. This model
has (d − k)-manifold (k-form) X symmetry, speciﬁed by
the local Z stabilizer constraints on the unit cell and
their translates (note this analysis extends to an arbitrary
cellulation of a closed d-manifold). See Sec. IV A for a
more detailed description of the 2D case.

B. Gauging Procedure

der η, and the local operator projection is given by

In this section we follow and generalize the approach
of [38] to produce a (nearly) unambiguous gauging proce-
dure for quantum states and operators with submanifold
symmetry.

To gauge the Hamiltonian Hm we must ﬁrst specify
the gauge degrees of freedom. We extend the canonical
choice for gauging a conventional k-form symmetry, given
by associating a gauge ﬁeld to each (k + 1)-cell, with a
recipe that also deals with more exotic cases. The gauge
and matter Hilbert space Hm ⊗ Hg is built by tensoring
in a gauge qubit for each Z constraint ﬁeld, i.e. each
label in GT . The locality of this system is described by
the bipartite interaction graph of the Z constraint ﬁelds,
which is generated by η. Hence η can now be thought
of as the map from gauge qubits to neighbouring matter
qubits.

The next ingredient in the gauging procedure is a set
of local constraints that project onto states satisfying a
Z2 ‘Gauss law’. This law states that the charge on each
matter qubit equals the sum of the ﬁelds on the neigh-
bouring gauge qubits. The local gauge constraints are
generated by the map

π :=


η†11Q

speciﬁcally each constraint is given by the projector

PΓ[·] :=XSΓ Oi,q

Pi,q(sq

i )(cid:12)(cid:12)Γ [·] Oi,q

Pi,q(sq

i )(cid:12)(cid:12)Γ

where (cid:12)(cid:12)Γ denotes the restriction of the operator onto the

qubits within the region Γ and the sum is over the set of
variables SΓ := {sq

i } ∈ {0, 1}|Γ|.

The matter Hamiltonian is gauged in a locality pre-

serving way as follows

H G

m :=Xi,k

G[hk,i] .

To construct the full gauged Hamiltonian in a nontrivial
way we must also specify some ﬁelds HB that describe dy-
namics of the gauge spins. We will introduce these ﬁelds
in the zero gauge coupling limit where the gauge degrees
of freedom are frozen to have ‘zero magnetic ﬂux’ (this is
analogous to a ﬂatness condition on a ﬁnite group con-
nection) perturbations away from this point are consid-
ered later. Note the HB ﬁelds are only deﬁned within the
gauge invariant subspace and so should commute with all
local gauge constrains. The Z ﬁelds commuting with all
Pi,q are precisely those described by polynomials in the
kernel of η, in addition we require them to be a set of in-
dependent generators that are local to a hypercube and
hence described by a map µ which generates the kernel
of η.

The full gauged Hamiltonian is then given by

Hfull := H G

m + ∆BHB + ∆P HP

where ∆B, ∆P > 0 and HP is the sum of all local gauge
projectors. From the deﬁnitions of the various Hamilto-
nian terms one can see that

onto the +1 eigenspace of the Pauli operator

[Hm, HB] = [HB, HP ] = [HP , Hm] = 0.

π xi ˆeq 7→ Pi,q(1)

where ˆeq is the column with a 1 in the qth entry and 0’s
elsewhere, and Pi,q(0) := 11. The full projector onto the
gauge invariant subspace is then given by the product of
these local projectors

Pi,q.

P =Yi,q

The state gauging map G : Hm → Hm ⊗ Hg is given by

G |ψi := P |ψi ⊗ |0i⊗N T

where N is the number of unit cells in the system. The
corresponding operator gauging map is deﬁned by

G[O] := PΓ[OOv∈Γ

|0i h0|v]

where Γ is a (minimal) region containing supp(O) that
is generated by a set of points corresponding to gauge

For ∆P suﬃciently large the low energy subspace of this
Hamiltonian is gauge invariant, with a true gauge theory
being recovered in the limit ∆P → ∞. When ∆B is also
suﬃciently large the states relevant to the low energy
physics are those within the gauge invariant subspace
the also have ‘ﬂat’ gauge connections (speciﬁed by the µ
constraints).

This full gauged Hamiltonian is equivalent, via a con-
stant depth circuit UD of local isometries, to another
Hamiltonian where the gauge has been ﬁxed to remove
the local gauge constraints thus restoring a clear tensor
product structure to the gauge invariant physics. The cir-
cuit is constructed from a product of controlled-X gates
from each matter qubit to each of its adjacent gauge
qubits (under the map η†). Note this unitary disentan-
gles each local gauge constraint Pi,q such that it becomes
a projector onto the |+i-state of the single qubit at site
(i, q). Hence the full disentangling isometry UD is given
by

UD :=Oi,q

h+| Yi,q Yxj ˆet∈η†xi ˆeq

CX(i,q)→(j,t) .

(5)

Now the disentangled Hamiltonian, which acts purely on
the gauge qubits remaining, is given by

We close the section by giving a summary of the full
gauging and disentangling procedure in terms of its ef-
fect on local symmetric Pauli terms. In the polynomial
language these are as follows

xiˆeq 7→ η†λQxiˆeq
ηxiˆet 7→ xiˆet

(6)

(7)

(6) describes the mapping of a single qubit X to a prod-
uct of X terms on the neighbouring gauge qubits and
(7) the mapping of a minimal symmetric Z ﬁeld (which
is necessarily generated by η) to a single Z on the cor-
responding gauge qubit. Note these mappings suﬃce to
describe the transformation of all local symmetric Pauli
matrices. In general the choice of p generating a set of
symmetric Z ﬁelds ηp may not be unique since the kernel
of η may be nontrivial. The exact term obtained is de-
termined by the local support set Γ that is chosen when
gauging the symmetric Z ﬁelds. All choices for gauging
this term are related by some local ﬁelds in HB since it
is generated by µ which also generates the kernel of η.
Hence all such choices have an equivalent action upon
the ground space provided ∆B is suﬃciently large.

In summary we have constructed a bipartite graph de-
termined by the X symmetry which is speciﬁed in the
polynomial language by η. The gauging procedure sends
single site X terms to a product of Xs on the neighbour-
ing gauge bits and symmetric Z terms (which necessarily
lie in the image of η) to a local term in their preimage
under η. Additional local Z ﬁelds were also introduced
in terms of the map µ which generates the kernel of η.
Hence we have a CSS stabilizer Hamiltonian speciﬁed by
the gauging complex

Pi,q(1) = X(M ) ⊗ 11g

Y(i,q)∈M

where g indicates the gauge subsystem.

Gauging in the zero coupling limit (described above in
terms of the maps G, G) provides an equivalence between
the gauged and ungauged models in that the operator
gauging map is invertible (in a sense) and furthermore all
symmetric expectation values are preserved. We proceed
to show this below. For the remainder of the section we
use the labeling convention that (j, t) are gauge qubits
while (i, q) are matter qubits.

Proposition 1. The operator gauging map is invert-
ible for symmetric operators O in the following sense

Tr(j,t)∈Γ(G[O] ·N(j,t)∈Γ |0i h0|) = O.

Proof. This is simply a calculation

C. Basic Properties of the Gauging Procedure

The mantra of gauging is ‘global symmetry to local
symmetry’. This is made precise in the gauging proce-
dure above as follows; any symmetry speciﬁed by a subset
of qubits M of the original model

X(M ) := O(i,q)∈M

Xi,q

where Λ is the full interaction graph (note the sums are
only over matter qubits (i, q) and the product is over
the gauge qubits (j, t)). Observe that due to the delta
condition this is by deﬁnition the sum over all symmetries
of the model.

Lemma 2. The identity G[O]G = GO holds for any sym-
metric local operator O.

Proof. The astute reader will notice the pattern, once

where the ﬁnal step follows from the delta condition and
the symmetry of O.

Proposition 2. Any matrix element of a local symmet-
ric operator O taken with respect to a symmetric state
|ψ0i and an arbitrary state |ψ1i is preserved by the gaug-
ing procedure i.e. hψ0| O |ψ1i = hψ0| G† G[O] G |ψ1i.

Proof. We have

hψ0| G† G[O] G |ψ1i = hψ0| G†G O |ψ1i

= hψ0| O |ψ1i

where the ﬁrst equality follows by Lemma 2 and the sec-
ond by Lemma 1.

Lemma 3. The states {G |λi}, for a basis {|λi} of Hm,
span the ground space of ∆BHB + ∆P HP with ∆B, ∆P >
0.

Proof. As discussed in Section III B the ground space
of HP is spanned by the states {P |λi ⊗ |ψi} for bases
{|λi}, {|ψi} of Hm, Hg respectively. To restrict to the
ground space of HB we consider the computational ba-

the X terms correspond

case when ker(µ†) = im(η†) (this is always true for our
constructions from topologically ordered CSS codes see
Sec. III E, if this assumption is loosened one must deal
more carefully with the ground space [39]) then the only
relevant states in Hg are generated by a Pauli operator
of the form η†p.

Note we have the relation P Pi,q(1) = P hence

where [Ni,q

P Pi,q(1)(cid:12)(cid:12)g = P Pi,q(1)(cid:12)(cid:12)m

where (cid:12)(cid:12)g/m denotes the restriction of the operator onto

the gauge or matter qubits respectively. Since any Pauli

Pi,q(1)(cid:12)(cid:12)m |λi ⊗ |0i⊗|Λ|
Pi,q(1)(cid:12)(cid:12)m |λi

where we have used Eq.(9). Hence the ground space is
spanned by states of the form {G |λi}.

m = Pi,k

Proposition 3. The gauging procedure preserves a gap,
i.e. if Hm has a uniform constant energy gap then Hfull
does too, provided the constants ∆B, ∆P are suﬃciently
large.

Proof. By Lemma 3, for ∆B, ∆P > 0 suﬃciently large,
the ground space of Hfull is spanned by states of the form
{G |λi}. Since H G
[hk,i] is a sum of gauged

local operators Lemma 2 implies that, for any matter
eigenstate Hm |λi = λ |λi, we have H G
mG |λi = λG |λi.
Hence Hfull has the same lowest eigenvalue as Hm (as-
suming a symmetric ground state) and gap ∆full ≥
min(∆m, ∆B, ∆P ).

Finally we note that Proposition 3 implies, by contra-
positive, that gauging gives an injective map from the set
of gapped phases of the ungauged model into the set of
gapped phases of the gauged model.

D. Properties of the Gauging Complex

Recall the gauging complex

G

σ−−−−→ P

ǫ−−−−→ E

(10)

deﬁned in terms of the maps involved in the gauging pro-
cedure σ = η† ⊕ µ. By focusing on the maps in the
gauging complex one can infer interesting relationships
between quantities pre- and post- gauging.

Firstly any product of the generating symmetric Z
ﬁelds which multiplies to identity in the initial model
gives an element p ∈ ker(η) and hence a Z symmetry of
the gauged model. Furthermore when the gauging com-
plex is exact and the gauged model topologically ordered
ker(η) is generated by the map µ and hence p = µ r, ∃r.
Then µ describes the minimal local Z-ﬁelds that commute
with the gauged X terms.

Secondly any X symmetry of the initial model is an
element p ∈ ker(η†) which speciﬁes a product of X stabi-
lizers equal to the identity, i.e. a redundant X stabilizer,
in the gauged model. This is relevant in the calculation
of the number of qubits encoded into the ground space of
the gauged model, which also requires information about
redundant Z stabilizers.

6

Notice that the gauging procedure is in fact a duality
map, in that applying it twice takes us back to the orig-
inal model. To achieve this duality we consider gauging
the Z symmetry, generated by µ, of the gauged model.
The local X ﬁelds commuting with this symmetry are
generated by η†, any product of them equal to identity is
in ker(η†) by deﬁnition and gives a symmetry of the twice
gauged model. Let φ be a local map generating ker(η†),
then φ describes the independent local X ﬁelds that com-
mute with the Z stabilizers of the twice gauged model.
These twice gauged Z terms are given by η. Note these
are precisely the local commuting Z and X ﬁelds in the
the initial stabilizer Hamiltonian. This suggests an ad-
dition to the picture of the gauging complex, completing
the circle of gauging

From this analysis it is clear that if ker(σX ) is locally
trivial, in the sense that it contains no local elements,
then the ungauged Hamiltonian possesses only global
symmetries and the stabilizers are all Z ﬁelds (see the
examples in Section IV). This point highlights a diﬀer-
ence between the cubic code and generalized toric codes,
while both the respective ungauged variants may have a
growing number of global X symmetries (one for each re-
dundant X stabilizer) the former has no local symmetries
whereas the latter has an extensive number. This is rele-
vant to the distinct behaviours of their ground state de-
generacies. It also seems indicative of spatially extended
vs. isolated pointlike excitations

where ˆσ := φ ⊕ η, & ˆǫ = ˆσ†λQ.

Collecting these facts together, we note the number of

encoded qubits in the ungauged model is

N [Q − T + SZ − SX ] + Fm

where N is the number of unit cells, Q the number of
matter qubits per site, T = rank(η) the number of lo-
cal Z stabilizers, SZ = rank(µ) the number of redundant
Z sabilizers locally, SX = rank(φ) the number of inde-
pendent local X symmetries and Fm accounts for global
products of X and Z stabilizers that multiply to the iden-
tity upon taking closed bounday conditions. While the
number of encoded qubits in the gauged model is given
by

N [T − Q + SX − SZ] + Fg

where T now corresponds to the number of gauge qubits
per site, Q the number of local X stabilizers, SX the num-
ber of redundant X stabilizers locally, SZ the number of
independent local Z stabilizers and again Fg accounts for
global products of X and Z stabilizers that multiply to
the identity upon taking closed bounday conditions for
the gauged model.

where σ = σX ⊕ σZ , one can read oﬀ a gauging duality.
This duality is speciﬁed in our language by the maps

F. Cluster State Construction & gauging

We now go slightly beyond CSS stabilizers and consider
cluster state models built on bipartite graphs speciﬁed
by the map η from the gauging procedure for some CSS
Hamiltonian. By construction this cluster state inherits
the X symmetry of the input ungauged model (corre-
sponding to ker(η†)) on one sublattice and an X sym-
metry on the other sublattice in position of each Z sym-
metry of the input gauged model. This cluster model
is clearly short-range entangled (SRE) since it can be
mapped to a trivial decoupled model via a local circuit
of CZs. However this disentangling does not respect the
symmetries. Hence these cluster states are candidates
for higher form or fractal symmetry-protected topologi-
cal (SPT) [47–51] states.

Several diﬀerent approaches could be taken when gaug-
ing this cluster model. We take advantage of the natural
bipartite structure of the system and treat the two dis-
joint sublattices separately. Since the terms appearing
on a single sublattice are either single Xs or products of
Zs, generated by η or η† respectively, one can instantly
read oﬀ the eﬀect of gauging one sublattice. Speciﬁcally
it results in a doubling of the qubits on the remaining
sublattice with each X, Z ﬁeld on that lattice now accom-
panied by a Z, X term, respectively, on the new partner
qubit.

Z ﬁelds generated by either µ or φ, depending on
the sublattice gauged, are also added to the new qubits.
These intermediate models can possess topological order
since they are equivalent to either the input gauged or
ungauged model under a local circuit of CZs. However
these gates do not respect the symmetry on the remain-
ing sublattice, which is indicative of the possibility of
symmetry-enriched topological (SET) [52–58] order.

Once both sublattices have been gauged one can easily
see that the model is mapped to itself up to local swaps
and Hadamards.

IV. FRACTAL SYMMETRIES

In this section we present several examples which con-
sist of pairs of models that are dual under gauging and
support interesting symmetries.

and single qubit X perturbations. This model has a frac-
tal X symmetry for each product of stabilizers equal to
the identity in the cubic code.

by inspecting the pictures that all translations of these
terms commute.

This model supports fractal X symmetries on each sub-
lattice. It inherits an X symmetry on the red sublattice
for each X symmetry of the cubic code and an X sym-
metry on the blue sublattice for each X symmetry of the

Note when gauging the Ising model one encounters a
situation in which ker(η) is nontrivial and it is easy to

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this note we have deﬁned a gauging procedure for
general submanifold symmetries, including those of frac-
tal type, within the framework of Pauli Hamiltonians.
We demonstrated relations between the pre- and post-
gauging models reminiscent of those obtained via the
conventional gauging procedure. Using the tools devel-
oped in this process we constructed short-range entangled
Ising and cluster models with fractal symmetries and ex-
amined their transformation under gauging.

This gauging procedure constitutes a small step to-
wards adapting the standard tools from the condensed
matter toolbox for application to more exotic 3D topo-
logical orders, including cases where the common sense
assumptions leading to a TQFT description are not sat-
isﬁed [34]. We are optimistic that this path leads to a
sanctum of strange and exotic phases of matter beyond
(conventional) TQFT, citing Haah’s cubic code [31] as a
demonstrative example.

Our approach opens

to more general
constructions and a possible relation between SRE

fractal-symmetric and exotic topological phases similar
to the well known connection between SPT phases and
Dijkgraaf-Witten theories [39, 59].
In particular the
gauging procedure applied to a subgroup of the global
symmetry allows one to construct and study fractal SET
phases. The fractal symmetries in this context may play
a role in understanding the most general transversal
gates in topological codes [60, 61] and a connection of
these phases of matter to quantum computation [62, 63].
