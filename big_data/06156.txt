The dynamics of spatial coherence and momentum distribution of polaritons in the regime of Bose-
Einstein condensation are investigated in a GaAs microcavity with embedded quantum wells under
nonresonant excitation with picosecond laser pulses. It is shown that the onset of the condensate
ﬁrst order sparial coherence is accompanied by narrowing of the polariton momentum distribution.
At the same time, at suﬃciently high excitation densities, there is signiﬁcant qualitative discrepancy
between the dynamic behavior of the width of the polariton momentum distribution determined from
direct measurements and that calculated from the coherence spatial distribution. This discrepancy
is observed at the fast initial stage of the polariton system kinetics and, apparently, results from the
strong spatial nonuniformity of the phase of the condensate wave function, which equilibrates on a
much longer time scale.

Polaritons in semiconductor microcavities with em-
bedded quantum wells (QWs), are quasiparticles corre-
sponding to mixed exciton-photon states in these het-
erostructures, represent a unique system for studying
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). The eﬀective mass
of microcavity polaritons near the bottom of the lower
dispersion branch is ∼ 10−4 of the free-electron mass,
which makes possible polariton BEC at high tempera-
tures, even up to the room temperature [1]. After the
demonstration of BEC in CdTe microcavities in 2006
[2], a number of interesting eﬀects related to this phe-
nomenon were investigated, including quantum vortices
[3], the superﬂuidity of the polariton condensate [4], the
Josephson eﬀect [5], the spin-Meissner eﬀect [6], polari-
ton solitons [7], and the optical spin Hall eﬀect [8]. Very
recently, an electrically pumped polariton laser working
at room temperature was demonstrated [9].

One of the main characteristics of a Bose condensate
is spatial coherence, i.e., the constancy of the phase of
the condensate wavefunction over distances exceeding the
thermal de Broglie wavelength. In this context, the dy-
namics of the onset of coherence in the process of the
condensate formation is an interesting issue, which was
investigated in [10–12]. In particular, in Ref. [12] it was
found that, in the process of formation of the polariton
condensate, coherence expands with a constant velocity
of ∼ 108 cm/s.

In the present work, for the ﬁrst time, the dynamics
of the spatial distribution of coherence and the corre-
sponding dynamics of the polariton momentum distri-
bution are investigated simultaneously. The relationship

∗ belykh@lebedev.ru

between these distributions is discussed. The structure
under study is a GaAs microcavity with the top and
bottom Bragg mirrors consisting of 32 and 36 pairs of
AlAs/Al0.13Ga0.87As layers, respectively. 12 GaAs/AlAs
7-nm-wide QWs are embedded in the microcavity. The
Rabi splitting and the Q factor of the structure are 4.5
meV and about 7000, respectively. The detuning be-
tween the photon and exciton modes is about -6 meV.
In all experiments, the sample temperature is 10 K. The
sample is excited by a Ti:sapphire laser emitting a peri-
odic train of 2.5-ps-long pulses at a repetition rate of 76
MHz. The excitation laser beam is focused in a spot of
20-30 µm in diameter. The excitation photon energy is
10-20 meV higher than the energy of the bottom of the
exciton mode.

The degree of spatial coherence is measured using the
Young double-slit experiment scheme [12, 13]. Using two
converging lenses (F1 ≈ 1 and F2 ≈ 10 cm) with coincid-
ing focal planes, an enlarged image of the sample with
a magniﬁcation of about 13 is obtained. A metal-coated
plate with a pair of 5-µm-wide transparent slits is placed
in the plane of this image. The slit spacing can be var-
ied from 20 to 160 µm. The chosen slit pair selects two
regions in the image of the spot, and the pattern formed
by the interference of radiation emitted from these two
regions is imaged by a third lens onto the entrance slit
of a spectrometer set to the zeroth diﬀraction order and
coupled to a streak-camera.

To measure the distribution of polaritons in momen-
tum space (k space), the plate with slits is removed from
the above setup. Then, owing to the presence of the
third lens, radiation emitted by the microcavity at a cer-
tain angle θ to the normal of the sample surface and,
thus, corresponding to polaritons with a wave vector

k = (ω/c) sin(θ) is imaged onto a certain point at the
slit of the spectrometer and, thus, of the streak camera.
The time resolution of the system in our measurements
is 10 ps.

Another quantity determined in our experiments is the
total number of polaritons N occupying the states near
the bottom of the lower polariton branch (LPB). This is
attained by measuring the power of radiation emitted by
the sample. The procedure of determining N is described
in detail in [12].

is

As

the pump power

increased above P0 ≈
750 W/cm2 a threshold-like increase in the intensity of
photoluminescence (PL) emitted at small angles with re-
spect to the normal takes place, giving evidence of the
onset of the macroscopic occupancy of the states near
the LPB bottom. This is illustrated by Fig. 1a, which
shows the PL spectra recorded at diﬀerent angles at a
pump density P = 1.2P0. The positions of the spectral
lines are shown by asterisks. The angular dependence of
these positions describes a part of the dispersion curve
corresponding to the LPB states in the strong-coupling
regime.

Above the threshold pump density, measurements in
the Young scheme reveal an interference pattern formed
by radiation emitted from the regions of the spot selected
by the two slits. This gives evidence of the onset of spa-
tial coherence and the BEC of polaritons. The dynamics
of the interference pattern for the separations between
the emitting regions of ∆x = 5 and 11 µm are shown in
Fig.1b.
In these experiments, the sample image is ad-
justed with respect to the slits in such a way that the
intensities of light collected from each of the slits are the
same. Then, the degree of spatial coherence g(1) is equal
to the interference pattern visibility, which is calculated
by performing a Fourier transform. The dependences of
the coherence function on the distance ∆x for diﬀerent
times after the excitation pulse are shown in Fig. 1c.
The coherence length rc is determined as the distance at
which g(1)(rc) = 1/e. To calculate rc the dependence of
g(1)(∆x) is approximated by exponential functions, also
shown in Fig. 1c.

Figure 2 shows the kinetic dependences of the coher-
ence length rc and the total number N of polaritons near
the bottom of the LPB. For excitation densities slightly
exceeding the BEC threshold density P0, the slow rise
and decay of N with a characteristic time of 50 ps is ac-
companied by qualitatively similar variation in rc. For
densities considerably higher than P0, the kinetics of N
clearly features two regions: the initial stage with a total
duration of about 50 ps and the second stage of slower
decay. At the ﬁrst (initial) stage, the kinetics of rc follows
that of N : an increase in N is accompanied by an increase
in rc, and a drop in N is accompanied by a decrease in
rc. A characteristic maximum in the kinetics of rc is
achieved simultaneously with the maximum in the num-
ber of polaritons. At the second stage, the dynamics of
rc changes abruptly. There appears a plateau, i.e., an in-
terval of time during which rc shows almost no decrease.

2

This interval is as long as 100 ps for P = 6.9P0. At
longer times, rc decays together with N , which decreases
with a characteristics time of 60 ps. As the pump power
is increased, the maximum value of rc attained in the
process of the condensate formation ﬁrst increases, has a
maximum for P = 2.3P0, and decreases at higher pow-
ers. Note, that the maximum value of rc is almost equal
to the size of the PL spot. This means that the conden-
sate occupies the entire excitation region. The decrease
in rc at high excitation powers can be related both to
an increase in the energy of particle-particle interactions
in the condensate [12] and to the stronger overheating of
the exciton reservoir [14].

The expansion of coherence and the formation of a
condensate are accompanied by narrowing of the polari-
ton momentum distribution. This is illustrated by Fig.
3a, which shows the dynamics of the polariton momen-
tum distribution for excitation densities of 1.3P0 and
3.4P0. The kinetics of the inverse width (FWHM) 1/∆k
of the momentum distribution for three diﬀerent exci-
tation densities are shown in Fig. 3b by closed sym-
bols.
In an ideal Bose gas at equilibrium, the polari-
ton momentum distribution function f (k) and the spa-
tial distribution of coherence g(1)(∆x) are connected by
the Fourier transform [13];
in this way a relation be-
tween rc and ∆k can be obtained. For a classical two-
dimensional Bose gas below the BEC threshold, f (k) ∼
exp(−k2/2mT ), g(1)(∆x) = exp(−mT ∆x2/2) and cor-
respondingly rc∆k = 3.3; above the BEC threshold
f (k) ∼ 1/(exp(k2/2mT − µ/T ) − 1) ≈ 1/(k2/2mT −
µ/T ), g(1)(∆x) ∼ exp(−∆xp2m|µ|), and correspond-

ingly rc∆k ≈ 2. However, the product of rc and ∆k,
measured experimentally are signiﬁcantly larger than 3.3
at the time corresponding to the highest polariton den-
sity and decreases to 2 (for P = 6.9P0) at the slow stage
of the condensate kinetics. Apparently, this is caused by
the strongly nonequilibrium character and the inhomo-
geneity of the system under consideration, as well as the
nonideality of the polariton gas.

In the general case, the relation between the polari-
ton momentum distribution and the spatial distribution
of coherence depends on the size of the system and the
spatial distribution of the phase ϕ(x) of the condensate.
The dependence of the far-ﬁeld radiation intensity on the
wave vector k, which (disregarding the small variation of
the photon Hopﬁeld coeﬃcient near the bottom of the
LPB) represents the momentum distribution of polari-
tons, is determined by the interference of electric ﬁelds
corresponding to diﬀerent points of the condensate and
is given by the formula

sider the integration with respect to two dimensions, x
and y. However, it can be shown that, if the function
E(x, y) allows the separation of variables (e.g., when
it is a Gaussian), this integral is reduced to Eq. (1),
where g(1) is deﬁned as the degree of coherence mea-
sured in a double-slit experiment. Equation (1) can
also be used to calculate the intensity distribution in
the experiment with two inﬁnitely narrow slits separated
by ∆x by substituting a ﬁeld distribution of the form
E(x) = E(∆x/2)[δ(x − ∆x/2) + δ(x + ∆x/2)].

We calculated the distribution I(k) at diﬀerent times
under the following assumptions: the spatial coherence
function can be written as g(1)(x) = exp(−x/rc), where
rc is determined from the experiment; the phase distri-
bution is uniform, i.e., ϕ(x) = const; and the spatial
distribution of the electric-ﬁeld amplitude of the conden-

sate is described by a Gaussian exp(−x2/L2). The size
L of the sample area occupied by the condensate is de-
termined by measuring the size of the magniﬁed image
of the condensate. For P = 1.3P0, 3.4P0, and 6.9P0, this
size is L = 12, 14, and 20 µm, respectively. The measured
and calculated distributions I(k) at time t = 150 ps for
P = 6.9P0 are shown in the inset in Fig. 3b. The ki-
netic dependencies of the inverse width 1/∆k character-
izing the calculated distributions I(k) are shown in Fig.
3b by open symbols. As one would expect, they repro-
duce to a large extent the kinetics of rc (Fig. 2). At the
same time, there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the
measured and calculated kinetic dependencies of 1/∆k
(Fig. 3b).

At a low excitation density of 1.3P0, the calculated and
observed kinetics of 1/∆k are similar, but the calculated

values exceed the measured ones by almost a factor of 2.
At higher excitation densities, there are signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences between the behaviors of the observed and calcu-
lated kinetics. For P = 3.4P0, the measured dependence
of 1/∆k exhibits at the ﬁrst (fast) stage of the kinetics
a short plateau followed by a rapid rise before entering a
longer plateau at the second (slow) stage. At the same
time, the calculated dependences of 1/∆k exhibit a sharp
maximum at the fast stage of the kinetics and then, after
an abrupt drop, enter a plateau at the slow stage (see
Fig. 3b for P = 3.4P0 and 6.9P0). The diﬀerences in the
behaviors of the decay kinetics of 1/∆k for t > 200 ps are
probably caused by the experimental uncertainty owing
to the small PL intensity in this time range.

The discrepancies in the values of 1/∆k measured di-
rectly and calculated on the basis of the experimentally
determined dependences g(1)(x) that occur at the fast
stage of the kinetics are most probably related to the
strong spatial nonuniformity of the phase of the conden-
sate wavefunction in this time range, which is disregarded
in the calculations. This nonuniformity causes a phase
shift ∆ϕ between the areas of the condensate selected by
the two slits, which, in the measurements of g(1)(x), leads
to a shift of the interference pattern without aﬀecting its
visibility. At the same time, phase nonuniformity causes
signiﬁcant broadening of the distribution I(k). This can
easily be seen upon substituting, e.g., a linearly varying
phase ϕ(x) ∼ x in Eq. (1). This assumption is supported
by the data in Fig. 4, which shows the kinetic depen-
dences of the phase diﬀerence ∆ϕ between the regions of
the condensate selected by the two slits. The values of
∆ϕ are determined from the shift of the interference pat-

tern. At the fast stage of the kinetics, ∆ϕ varies consid-
erably, and these variations are larger for larger distances
∆x between the corresponding areas of the condensate.
These results give evidence of the strong spatial nonuni-
formity of the phase. Upon the transition to the slow
stage of the kinetics, the variation of ∆ϕ becomes much
weaker, and the phase distribution tends to the steady
state.

The spatial nonuniformity of the phase may originate
from the inhomogeneity of the potential energy of po-

laritons in the microcavity plane, which may cause the
formation of topological defects in the condensate, such
as quantum vortices [3] and dark solitons [15]. Upon a
round trip about the core of such a defect, the phase
varies by 2π, and the defect size is determined by the

healing length ξ = /p(2mαN/S) [15], where m is the

polariton eﬀective mass, α is the polariton-polariton in-
teraction constant, and S is the area of the condensate.
Thus, ξ determines the characteristic length scale upon
which the phase varies by ∼ π. Substituting numeri-
cal values of m = 5 × 10−32 g, α = 10−12 meV cm2,
and S = 10−6 cm2, we ﬁnd that, for P = 3.4P0, near the
peak of the intensity, when N ∼ 104, the healing length is
ξ = 8 µm noticeably smaller than the size of the area oc-
cupied by the condensate (L = 14 µm). Thus, the phase
nonuniformity resulting from the formation of topolog-
ical defects may lead to the considerable broadening of
the polariton momentum distribution. At the slow stage
of the kinetics, N ∼ 2000 and ξ = 18 µm. In this sit-
uation, the contribution of phase nonuniformity to the
increase in ∆k is much smaller.

measured the dynamic characteristics of the spatial co-
herence and polariton momentum distribution under the
conditions of polariton Bose-Einstein condensation in a
GaAs microcavity with embedded QWs. We have shown
that, at suﬃciently high densities of nonresonant picosec-
ond laser excitation, there are two stages in the dynam-
ics of the total number of polaritons in the condensate.
At the ﬁrst, fast, stage, the coherence length increases
abruptly and then decreases, following the correspond-
ing changes in the number of polaritons occupying states
near the bottom of the LPB. At the same time, the po-
lariton momentum distribution exhibits steady narrow-
ing that ceases only at the slow stage in the kinetics of
the number of particles in the condensate. The observed
diﬀerence in the character of the dynamics of spatial co-
herence and polariton momentum distribution at the fast
stage of the condensate kinetics is presumably caused
by spatial nonuniformity in the distribution of the phase
of the condensate wavefunction, which smoothens much
slower.

Note that, at higher excitation densities, the formation
of the condensate may take place in several areas of the
microcavity simultaneously, which may also contribute
to the initial nonuniformity of the phase. Indeed, phases
in these areas are initially independent and equalize in
the course of the condensate formation.

In conclusion, we have for the ﬁrst time simultaneously
