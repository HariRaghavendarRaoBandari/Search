Resonance ﬂuorescence spectra from semiconductor quantum dots coupled to

slow-light photonic crystal waveguides

Using a polaron master equation approach we investigate the resonance ﬂuorescence spectra from
coherently driven quantum dots (QDs) coupled to an acoustic phonon bath and a photonic crystal
waveguide with a rich local density of photon states (LDOS). Resonance ﬂuorescence spectra from
QDs in semiconductor crystals are known to show strong signatures of electron-phonon interactions,
but when coupled to a structured photonic reservoir, the QD emission properties are also determined
by the frequency dependence of the LDOS of the photon reservoir. Here, we investigate the simulta-
neous role of coupled photon and phonon baths on the characteristic Mollow triplet spectra from a
strongly driven QD. As an example structured photonic reservoir, we ﬁrst study a photonic crystal
coupled cavity waveguide, and ﬁnd that photons and phonons have counter-interacting eﬀects near
the upper mode-edge of the coupled-cavity waveguide, thus establishing the importance of their
separate roles in determining the emission spectra. The general theory is developed for arbitrary
photonic reservoirs and is further applied to determine resonance the ﬂuorescence spectra from a
realistic, disordered W1 photonic crystal waveguide showing important photon-phonon interaction
eﬀects that are directly relevant to emerging experiments and theoretical proposals.

INTRODUCTION

The discrete energy levels of a semiconductor quantum
dot (QD) makes it promising for scalable quantum infor-
mation applications1 at optical frequencies. Moreover,
the observation of resonance ﬂuorescence spectra2 from
QDs3,4 strongly establishes their atomlike nature mim-
icking a discrete two-level quantum system when driven
by a coherent laser drive2. Strong ﬁeld-dressing of the
emitter states results in three distinct spectral emissions
also known as the Mollow triplet2. Compared to simple
two-level atoms, however, semiconductor QDs are cou-
pled to the underlying lattice dynamics or phonons which
inﬂuence the light emission properties5–8. For example,
phonon interaction leads to asymmetric line broadening
and oscillator strength modiﬁcation in the Mollow triplet
spectra for coherently excited QDs4,9.

Apart from phonon-modiﬁed emission dynamics, light-
matter interactions in a QD are also inﬂuenced by its
photonic environment10,11, e.g., resulting in the Purcell
eﬀect or an increase in the spontaneous emission (SE)
rate. The SE rate of a quantum emitter is determined by
its projected photonic local density of states (LDOS) at
the frequency of the emitter; in the domain of strong ﬁeld
resonance ﬂuorescence, the emission spectrum consists of
three distinct spectral resonances, which in general de-
pend on a sampling of LDOS values from three diﬀerent
spectral regions of the photonic reservoir12,13, namely at
ωL ± Ω, where ωL is the frequency of the drive and Ω is
the Rabi frequency. Hence emission from QDs coupled
to structured photonic reservoirs can bear signatures of
both the coupled phonon and photon baths. In fact for
QD SE decay, interactions between these baths becomes
particularly important, when their decay dynamics com-
pare in their time evolution. Emission from QDs un-

der this situation sample a broadband photonic LDOS
values around the emitter frequency, in direct violation
of Fermi’s golden rule14,15. The latter study was per-
formed under weak driving (excitation) conditions15,16,
when emission is only dominant around the QD fre-
quency. The role of this intercorrelated photon-phonon
dynamics is, to teh best of our knowledge, unknown un-
der strong driving conditions for an arbitrarily shaped
LDOS. The problem has been partly investigated, how-
ever, in the case of QDs coupled to simple Lorentzian
cavities4,17–19. Coupling with more complex photonic
structures (e.g. photonic crystal (PC) band edges20) has
been usually treated under a secular approximation20,21,
where the calculated side-band intensities do not reﬂect
the underlying asymmetry of the photon bath. Attempts
to include correlation eﬀects from simultaneous coupling
to structured photon and phonon reservoirs have resorted
to simplifying mean-ﬁeld approximations20 for phonons
which only leads to a simple overall renormalization of
the QD-photon bath coupling. Thus a self-consistent
quantum theory describing eﬀects of arbitrary structured
photon and phonon reservoirs on QD resonance ﬂuores-
cence spectra is lacking.

In this paper, we develop a polaron master equation
(ME) approach19,22–24 to model the resonance ﬂuores-
cence spectra from a strongly driven QD, simultaneously
coupled to an arbitrary structured photon bath and an
acoustic phonon bath. We ﬁrst choose the case of a
coupled-cavity PC waveguide (Fig. 1(a)) which has use
for slow-light propagation25 and on-chip single photon
emission applications26–29. The developed model is then
applied to investigate the role of photon and phonon bath
coupling in the waveguide emitted Mollow triplet spectra.

ues gives rise to a Mollow triplet spectrum with asym-
metric sideband intensities and linewidths9. One conse-
quence of phonon coupling is that the linewidths of the
Mollow sidebands are asymmetric12 which is also a signif-
icant source of line broadening in the QDs. Asymmetric
linewidth broadening of Mollow sidebands has been in-
vestigated previously4,9,18, but here we focus only on the
asymmetry of sideband intensity also in the presence of
a rich LDOS photon coupling. The intensity asymme-
try arising due to an interplay of photons and phonons
can be clearly distinguished near the upper waveguide
mode-edge, where the two baths have counter-interacting
eﬀects. The asymmetries of the Mollow spectra as a func-
tion of laser-exciton detuning is also investigated to bet-
ter identify the role of the incoherent photon and phonon
scattering mechanisms. The general theory is further ap-
plied to study the spectral response of a QD coupled to
a disordered W1 waveguide (Fig. 1(b)), using a realis-
tic LDOS model that has been used to explain experi-
ments30.

II. THEORY

We focus on the single exciton state of a neutral QD
(strong conﬁnement regime) which can be modelled as
a two-level system described by Pauli spin operators σ±
(Fig. 1(c)). Such a two-level atomic model of a QD has
been successfully used to explain numerous experiments
investigating phonon-dressed emission from QDs coupled
to structured reservoirs4,5,17,18. The QD located at spa-
tial position rd is simultaneously coupled to a photon
and phonon bath described by lowering operators f (ω)
and bq, respectively, where the subscript denotes the qth
mode of the phonon reservoir. The QD is driven by a

3

tions of weak coupling (i.e, non-polaronic) polaron ME
at low temperatures39,40.

In addition to the drive-induced phonon scattering
rates, incoherent interaction with the photon bath is also
inﬂuenced by phonons14 and is given by14

The above rates incorporate the spectral shape of the
phonon bath by accounting for phonon damping dur-

weak and strong drives38.
In the limit of weak driv-
ing, previously derived expressions32 for the scattering
terms Γσ+/σ−
and Γcd are naturally recovered starting
from Eq. (5).
It should also be mentioned that we re-
tain only four relevant terms out of a total of seven an-
alytical phonon rates derived from Lphon(ρ) in our cur-
rent work, which uses parameters corresponding to InAs
QDs9, since the other terms are found to be negligible38.
Longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonon interaction due to de-
formation potential coupling plays the strongest role in
InAs (and GasAs) QDs, and we use the spectral func-
tion Jpn(ω) = αpω3 exp[− ω2

the derived polaron ME (Eq. 3) is rigorously valid up to
drive strengths of Ω ≈ 1 meV and this has been explicitly
veriﬁed (not shown) by matching the results with solu-

and the IBM phase φ(τ ) appears in S0 due to transfor-
mation from a polaron frame to the lab frame16, and
the propagator, αP(rD, rd; ω), of the photon reservoir,
describes propagation from the QD to the detector at
rD. The projected spectrum SP can be experimentally
observed, e.g., through the waveguide modes and the po-
larization spectrum S0 can be observed using the back-
ground decay channels γb (e.g., above light line modes
in a PC slab waveguide36). All our spectrum calcu-
lations make use of the quantum optics toolbox41.
It
should be noted that the polaron ME in its original
integro-diﬀerential form (Eq. 3) can of course be numer-
ically solved for a given structured reservoir and we have
checked that the calculated spectrum exactly matches the
spectrum computed using polaron ME with the incoher-
ent scattering rates (not shown). Naturally, the analyti-
cal rates are easier to work with and help to explain the
underlying physics.

III. RESULTS

A. Slow-light coupled cavity waveguide

The optical scattering rates (Eq. 8) indicate that the
role of photon reservoir in QD Mollow spectra will be
strongest in a media which displays spectral inhomo-
genety over the width of the Mollow triplets, namely
ωL±Ω. One such relevant example is a PC coupled-cavity
waveguide42 shown in Fig. 1(a). Assuming nearest neigh-
bour coupling between adjacent cavities of mode volume
Veﬀ , an analytical tight binding technique42,43 can be ap-
plied to derive an expression for the waveguide photon
reservoir function,

Figure 2 (a) plots the Purcell factor (PF, dashed)
and normalized αP (solid), respectively, for a waveguide
formed by coupling individual cavities of Q (quality fac-
tor) factor ≈ 52000. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the waveg-
uide structure presents spectral regions, with slow (mid-
dle band) and fast (mode-edges, ωu,l) variation of pho-
tonic LDOS (Fig. 2(a)). To develop a simple physical
understanding of emitted spectra, we initially consider a
QD tuned to the band-center (ωx = ω0) of the waveguide
(Fig. 2(b)). This is a region where the photonic LDOS is
almost constant over a broad spectral range (≈ 4 meV,
dashed line Fig. 2(b)) and the polarization spectra S0 of a
resonantly-driven QD (∆xL = 0) without phonons (solid
light), resembles a symmetric Mollow triplet with three
peaks located at ω = ω0, ω0±Ω, where drive amplitude Ω
= 1 meV. This symmetry of the Mollow sidebands about
the drive frequency is expected in the absence of any
variations of the photonic LDOS2,12. When the eﬀects
of phonon interactions are included, strong asymmetries
arise amongst the sidebands of the polarization spectrum
S0 (dark solid, Fig. 2(b)). The intensity of the peaks re-
duce from left to right, suggesting enhanced emission at
lower energies. This asymmetry in the Mollow sidebands
has been previously observed in phonon-dressed Mollow
spectra from bare QDs9 (i.e., not in a structured reser-
voir) and it arises due to unequal phonon emission and
absorption rates at low temperatures19,45. The phonon-
induced asymmetry can also be observed in the weak ex-
citation spectra of bare QDs16,44 (inset, Fig. 2(a)), which
resembles the IBM spectrum24. Phonon-induced emis-
sion asymmetry of the Mollow spectra has been previ-
ously explained using a polaron ME of Lindblad form,
derived assuming small drive strengths Ω19,32; however,
the spectrum calculations using the new phonon scatter-
ing terms (Eq. 5) are valid for large Ω, and produce an
even stronger asymmetry between the sidebands that can
be attributed to the newly presented phonon scattering
38 (see later). Apart from the intensity asymme-
term Γu
try, phonons also cause spectral broadening and reduced
splitting of the sidebands (dark solid, Fig. 2(b)). The
power dependent broadening also known as excitation
induced dephasing arises due to the Ω2 dependence of
the phonon terms (Eq. 5) and the reduced splitting hap-
pens due to renormalization of the drive amplitude (i.e.
ΩR → hBi Ω)32. For example at a phonon bath temper-
ature of 4 K, then hBi ≈ 0.9, causing a 10% reduction of
the coherent Rabi drive. Figure 2(c) plots the polariza-

scale (dB), which shows the phonon-induced asymmetries
more clearly and these will be useful in understanding the
role of the waveguide mode-edges in the projected spec-
tra, discussed below.

The reservoir projected spectra SP (Fig. 2(d)) is ob-
16, accounting for phonon
tained by projecting S0 with αP
emission from the QD to a detector. The projector func-
tion αP (Fig. 2(a), dark solid) can be approximated as
a sum of two sharp Lorentzians about the waveguide
mode-edges and is roughly constant around the region
of the Mollow triplet. The projected spectra (Fig. 2(d))
hence resembles the polarization spectra (Fig. 2(b)) in
this region. The spectral regions near the PC mode-
edges are however strongly magniﬁed in the projected
spectra (Fig. 2(e)) compared to the polarization spectra
(Fig. 2(c)) leading to the appearance of ﬁve distinct peaks
(Fig. 2(e)). The spectra is plotted in a log scale (dB) in
Fig. 2(e) to better show the appearance of the ﬁve peaks
in SP . Phonon induced asymmetry eﬀects also appear in
the peaks around the mode-edges (dark line Fig. 2 (e)),

FIG. 3: (color online). Normalized polarization spectra S0 of
a QD located near the lower (a) and the upper (c) mode-edge of
a waveguide. (b) and (d) show the normalized projected spectra
SP corresponding to (a) and (c). The dark (light) solid lines show
calculations with (without) phonons. The insets in (b) and (d)
shows SP in a log scale. The light dashed line shows the normalized
photonic LDOS proﬁle, as a reference in (a, c). Calculations use
the same parameters as in Fig. 2.

which is absent in the non-phonon case (light line).

Near band center, the Mollow spectra investigated in
Fig. 2 (b) is minimally inﬂuenced by the photonic LDOS
since it is roughly constant near the Mollow triplet fre-
quencies (dashed line, Fig. 2(b)) and photon eﬀects are
only observed in the projected spectra near mode-edges,
far away from the Mollow peaks.

To better investigate the role of photon-phonon dy-
namics in the Mollow spectra, we next calculate the res-
onant (∆xL = 0 meV) spectrum for the QD tuned near
the waveguide mode-edge (Fig. 3). Once again, solid dark
and light lines represent calculation with and without
phonons. Figures 3 (a) and (b) plot the normalized polar-
ization spectra S0 and projected spectra SP , respectively,
for a QD tuned near the lower mode-edge and Fig. 3(b)
and (d) plots the same quantities near the upper mode-
edge. Since the bandwidth of the waveguide mode-edges
where the photonic LDOS varies maximally is small, we
choose a smaller value of Ω = 0.4 meV for calculating
the Mollow spectra. This way, the three Mollow peaks
sample diﬀerent regions of photonic LDOS. For the Mol-
low spectra near the lower and upper mode-edge with-
out phonons (light line, Fig. 3(a) and (c)), the intensity
of the sideband sampling a lower photonic LDOS (out-
side waveguide band) is stronger than the one sampling a
higher photonic LDOS (inside the waveguide band). Sim-
ilar intensity asymmetry has been previously reported in
case of a Lorentzian cavity34, where the Mollow side-
bands sample spectral regions with diﬀerent photonic
LDOS. It is possible to derive the emission spectra ana-
lytically in the limit of a Lorentzian cavity and derived
spectrum shows that the brighter Mollow sideband sam-
ples a smaller photonic LDOS (see dashed line of Fig. 5

in Ref.34). The current waveguide results shows similar
behavior and here we go beyond previous photon reser-
voir theories using the secular approximation21, which
predicts equal sideband intensities irrespective of asym-
metries of the underlying photon bath.

When phonons are included, the intensity of the
side-bands increase (dark solid lines, Fig. 3 (a, c)).
This phonon-induced enhancement outside the waveg-
uide band can limit the eﬃciency of atomic switching
schemes using the mode-edge LDOS asymmetry13. Since
the bandwidth of the waveguide (≈ 8 meV) is greater
than that of the phonon bath (≈ 5 meV), emission near
band-edge far from the QD is negligible and hence ig-
nored in Fig. 3. As mentioned above, phonons enhance
emission at low energies. Near the upper mode-edge, this
leads to a strong enhancement of the Mollow side-band
inside the waveguide band compared to the one outside.
Thus the upper mode-edge (Fig. 3 (c)) presents an inter-
esting spectral region where the phonon and photon bath
act against each other in determining the ﬁnal intensities
of the Mollow side-bands. This is not the case however
for the lower mode-edge, where the lower Mollow side-
band always remains stronger than the upper one. Note
that previous mean-ﬁeld treatments20 predicting a simple
phonon renormalization of the QD-photon bath coupling
will not produce such intensity asymmetry between the
Mollow sidebands. The projected spectrum SP (Fig. 3 (b,
d)) show almost an order of magnitude lowering of the
Mollow side-bands compared to the central line (at ωx),
due to strong suppression by the narrow Lorentzian pro-
jector at the waveguide mode-edge. The corresponding
insets plots the respective projected spectra in a log-scale
(dB) and shows that the Mollow side-band asymmetries
of the polarization spectra S0, arising due to the photon
and phonon baths are retained in SP .

At the level of the polaron ME, the incoherent scatter-
ing terms M ′(ΩR) (Eq. 8) and Γu (Eq. 5) are directly
responsible for the photon and phonon-induced inten-
sity asymmetries of the Mollow side-bands, respectively.
They also represent similar mathematical terms at the
level of the ME (Eqs. 5 and 8), namely the commutator of
population σz and polarization σ− and similar terms have
been shown previously to be responsible for phonon in-
duced asymmetries of vacuum Rabi doublets in a strongly
coupled QD-cavity systems16,47,48. The real and imagi-
nary parts of M (Ω) = Mr(Ω) + iMi(Ω) (Γu = Γr
u + iΓi
u)
are plotted in Fig. 4 (a) ((c)) and (b) ((d)), respectively,
as a function of detuning ∆Lx, for a ﬁxed drive amplitude
Ω. The detuning is varied by tuning the QD with respect
to a ﬁxed laser frequency. Though the phonon modiﬁed
rate, M ′(ΩR) enters into the ME (Eq. 3), in this discus-
sion we focus on the behavior of rate M (Ω), which is not
modiﬁed by phonons. This does not aﬀect the reason-
ing below, since for the parameters used, phonons cause
very little diﬀerence (not shown) in M (Ω), other than a
slight reduction near the optimum points (Fig. 4(a, b)).
The thick dark, dashed and light line in Fig. 4(a) plots
M (Ω) when the drive laser is located near lower mode-

6

edge, band-center and upper mode-edge of the waveguide
band respectively. As is the case with most of our Mollow
spectra calculations, the three plots correspond to a value
of Ω = 0.4 meV. Calculations for higher drives (thin dark
line, Ω = 1 meV) show similar behavior to calculations
for lower drives (thick dark line, Ω = 0.4 meV), when the
laser is located near the lower mode-edge. The phonon
term, Γu is not inﬂuenced by photon bath and is plotted
for Ω = 0.4 meV (Fig. 4(c, d)). Note that we have veriﬁed
analytically and numerically (not shown) that only the
real parts of M (Ω) and Γu contribute to any intensity
asymmetries of the Mollow spectra. As expected from
Fig. 2(b), M (Ω) is smaller by three orders of magnitude
at the band-center compared to the mode-edges and the
photonic LDOS does not inﬂuence the Mollow spectra
(solid light line, Fig. 2(b)).

The full resonant Mollow spectra with phonons (dark
solid line) from Fig. 2(b) suggest that a positive value
of Γr
u (at ∆xL = 0 meV) correlates with a strong lower
Mollow side-band compared to the upper one. The cor-
responding resonant Mr(Ω) near the lower mode-edge
(Fig. 4(a), thick dark solid, at ∆xL = 0 meV) has a
positive value (0.93) and produces a similar asymmetry
in the spectrum without phonons (light line, Fig. 3(a)).
A negative resonant Mr(Ω) (= −0.95) near the upper
mode-edge (Fig. 4(a), thick light solid) leads to opposite
assymetry of Mollow sidebands, without phonons, (light
line, Fig. 3(c)). Since Γr
u ≥ Mr(Ω) at ∆xL = 0 meV, the
sideband of the ﬁnal spectrum (thick dark, Fig. 3(c)) is
stronger to the left.

QD-laser detunings ∆Lx. The dashed line shows the normalized
proﬁle of the photonic LDOS and the laser is spectrally ﬁxed (cen-

of the Mollow side-bands becomes more clear, when the
spectrum is plotted as a function of detuning ∆Lx. Fig-
ure 5 plots the normalized polarization spectrum with
(thick dark solid) and without phonons (thin light), for
diﬀerent detunings ∆Lx, near the upper mode-edge of the
waveguide (dark dashed). For small negative detunings
(∆Lx = −0.1 meV), Mr(Ω) has a larger negative value (-
2) compared to its value (−0.95) at ∆Lx = 0 meV (thick
light, Fig. 4(a)), and the spectrum without phonons (thin
light) shows a larger asymmetry between Mollow side-
bands, with a strong upper band. Inclusion of phonons
(thick dark) reduces this assymetry since Γr
u > |Mr(Ω)|.
For a small positive detuning (∆Lx = 0.2 meV), Mr(Ω)
is positive (= 1) (thick light, Fig. 4(a)) and the lower
Mollow side-band without phonons is now stronger (light
line, Fig. 5). A larger value of ∆Lx is chosen for the pos-
itive detuning case since at ∆Lx = 0.1 meV, Mr(Ω) is
very small (= 0.2). When detuning ∆Lx is large com-
pared to drive amplitude ΩR (= 0.4 meV), the side-band
spectrally closer to the QD dominates. This is veriﬁed
by spectrum calculations at large detunings (∆Lx ± 0.6
meV, top and bottom curves, Fig. 5), where the sideband
closer to the QD is strongest and the importance of the
assymetry terms (Mr(Ω), Γr

u) becomes minimal.

B. Disordered W1 photonic crystal waveguide

The role of the interacting photon and phonon baths on
the QD spectra were explored so far in the case of a model
coupled-cavity waveguide. Since the theory is valid for
arbitrary structured reservoirs, we can apply it to explore

such dynamics in any desired LDOS reservoir function.
By way of an example, we next consider a W1 PC waveg-
uide (cf. Fig. 1 (b)) which is formed by introducing a line
defect in a triangular lattice of air holes etched in a semi-
conductor slab. To further demonstrate the strength of
out technique, we also add in realistic structural disorder
to the waveguide, using full 3D numerical simulations.
The disorder perturbation is characterized by a random
hole center shift drawn from a normal probability distri-
bution having a zero mean and non-zero standard devia-
tion denoted by σ. This is shown schematically in Fig. 6
(a). We choose a pitch of a = 240 nm, and model GaAs
membranes with a slab dielectric constant of ε = 12.11.
In terms of a, we use a corresponding W1 waveguide with
a hole radius of r = 0.295a, slab height of h = 0.625a,
and the length of the waveguide is ﬁxed at 30a. Intrinsic
disorder is present due to manufacturing imperfections,
and is chosen to be σ = 0.005a = 1.2 nm, which has been
shown to match the DOS of related experiments50. With
these parameters, a y-oriented dipole placed at the center
of the waveguide (an anti-node for the ﬁeld component
Ey) excites the fundamental mode modiﬁed by the in-
trinsic disorder present in the waveguide. The resulting
Purcell factor calculated from a full 3D FDTD simula-
tion is shown in Fig. 6(a) and the disordered electric-ﬁeld
mode proﬁle (|Ey|2) at ωc (center of the mode resonance,
formed near the W1 mode edge) is shown Fig. 6(b), where
we show the ﬁeld proﬁle at slab center; see Ref. 30 for
numerical implementation details.

Using the above W1 photon bath LDOS results,
Fig. 7(a) plots the Purcell factor and normalized projec-
tor for the disordered W1 waveguide at the ﬁeld antin-
ode position. Both the PF and the projector show two
resonances close to the mode-edge. Figure 7(b) plots

match the spectral separation between the two LDOS

photons strongly enhance the intensity of the lower side-
band, sampling a smaller photonic LDOS. Figure 7(c)

waveguides, and presented a theory that allows one to
include both photon and phonon coupling in the pres-
ence of a strong pump ﬁeld. A strong spectral variation
of the coupled photon and phonon LDOS values cause
a rich intensity asymmetry in the Mollow triplet side-
bands from a coherently driven QD. As a ﬁrst exam-
ple of a structured photon reservoir, we chose a coupled
cavity PC waveguide which shows spectral regions that
support both fast and slow spectral variations of the pho-
tonic LDOS. Spectral inhomogeneities of the photon and
phonon baths separately inﬂuence the side-band inten-
sities and their separate roles are identiﬁed by investi-
gating the Mollow spectra near the upper mode-edge of
the coupled cavity waveguide. In this slow-light region,
photon and phonon baths counteract each other to de-
termine the ﬁnal side-band intensities. The important
incoherent photon and phonon scattering terms respon-
sible for causing the intensity asymmetry are identiﬁed
at the level of the polaron ME, where phonon coupling
eﬀects are included nonperturbatively. The polaron ME
technique developed is quite general and can be applied
to arbitrary structured photon baths proﬁles. As a fur-
ther example, we also studied the case of a driven QD in
a disordered W1 slab waveguide, and once again showed
the important role of coupled photon and phonon inter-
actions in the light emission from a coherent drive. These
dynamical eﬀects of coupling to both phonon and photon
baths are relevant for understanding related experiments
and emerging applications of QD waveguide systems.
