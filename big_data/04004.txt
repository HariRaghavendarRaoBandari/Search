Two-phase heat conductors with a stationary isothermic

surface ∗

Shigeru Sakaguchi†

March 15, 2016

Dedicated to Professor Giovanni Alessandrini on his sixties birthday

Abstract

We consider a two-phase heat conductor in RN with N ≥ 2 consisting of a core and
a shell with diﬀerent constant conductivities. Suppose that, initially, the conductor

has temperature 0 and, at all times, its boundary is kept at temperature 1. It is shown

that, if there is a stationary isothermic surface in the shell near the boundary, then

the structure of the conductor must be spherical. Also, when the medium outside

the two-phase conductor has a possibly diﬀerent conductivity, we consider the Cauchy
problem with N ≥ 3 and the initial condition where the conductor has temperature
0 and the outside medium has temperature 1. Then we show that almost the same

proposition holds true.

Key words. heat equation, two-phase heat conductor, transmission condition, initial-boundary value

problem, Cauchy problem, stationary isothermic surface, symmetry.

Introduction

Let Ω be a bounded C 2 domain in RN (N ≥ 2) with boundary ∂Ω, and let D be a bounded
C 2 open set in RN which may have ﬁnitely many connected components. Assume that

where σc, σs, σm are positive constants and σc 6= σs. This kind of three-phase electrical
conductor has been dealt with in [KLS] in the study of neutrally coated inclusions.

In the present paper we consider the heat diﬀusion over two-phase or three-phase heat

conductors. Let u = u(x, t) be the unique bounded solution of either the initial-boundary

value problem for the diﬀusion equation:

ut = div(σ∇u)
u = 1

u = 0

in Ω × (0, +∞),
on ∂Ω × (0, +∞),
on Ω × {0},

or the Cauchy problem for the diﬀusion equation:

ut = div(σ∇u)

in RN × (0, +∞) and u = XΩc on RN × {0},

(1.1)

(1.2)

(1.3)

(1.4)

where XΩc denotes the characteristic function of the set Ωc = RN \ Ω. Consider a bounded
domain G in RN satisfying

D ⊂ G ⊂ G ⊂ Ω and dist(x, ∂Ω) ≤ dist(x, D) for every x ∈ ∂G.

(1.5)

The purpose of the present paper is to show the following theorems.

Theorem 1.1 Let u be the solution of problem (1.1)-(1.3) for N ≥ 2, and let Γ be a
connected component of ∂G satisfying

dist(Γ, ∂Ω) = dist(∂G, ∂Ω).

If there exists a function a : (0, +∞) → (0, +∞) satisfying

u(x, t) = a(t) for every (x, t) ∈ Γ × (0, +∞),

then Ω and D must be concentric balls.

(1.6)

(1.7)

Corollary 1.2 Let u be the solution of problem (1.1)-(1.3) for N ≥ 2. If there exists a
function a : (0, +∞) → (0, +∞) satisfying

u(x, t) = a(t) for every (x, t) ∈ ∂G × (0, +∞),

(1.8)

then Ω and D must be concentric balls.

2

Theorem 1.3 Let u be the solution of problem (1.4) for N ≥ 3. Then the following
assertions hold:

(1) If there exists a function a : (0, +∞) → (0, +∞) satisfying (1.8), then Ω and D must

be concentric balls.

(2) If σs = σm and there exists a function a : (0, +∞) → (0, +∞) satisfying (1.7) for a

connected component Γ of ∂G with (1.6), then Ω and D must be concentric balls.

Corollary 1.2 is just a corollary of Theorem 1.1. Theorem 1.3 is limited to the case
where N ≥ 3, which is not natural, is required because of a technical reason for the use of
the auxiliary functions U, V, W given in section 4. We conjecture that Theorem 1.3 holds

true also for N = 2.

The condition (1.7) means that Γ is an isothermic surface of the normalized temper-

ature u at every time, and hence Γ is called a stationary isothermic surface of u. When
D = ∅ and σ is constant on RN , a symmetry theorem similar to Theorem 1.1 or Theorem
1.3 has been proved in [MS5, Theorem 1.2, p. 2024] provided the conclusion is replaced by

that ∂Ω must be either a sphere or the union of two concentric spheres, and a symmetry

theorem similar to Corollary 1.2 has also been proved in [MS2, Theorem 1.1, p. 932]. The

present paper gives a generalization of the previous results to multi-phase heat conductors.

We note that the study on the relationship between the stationary isothermic surfaces

and the symmetry of the problems has been initiated by Alessandrini [A1, A2]. Indeed,
when D = ∅ and σ is constant on RN , he considered the problem where the initial data in
(1.3) is replaced by the general data u0 in problem (1.1)-(1.3). Then he proved that if all
the spatial isothermic surfaces of u are stationary, then either u0 − 1 is an eigenfunction
of the Laplacian or is a ball where u0 is radially symmetric.

The following sections are organized as follows. In section 2, we give four preliminaries

where the balance laws given in [MS1, MS2] play a key role on behalf of Varadhan’s

formula (see (2.4)) given in [V]. Section 3 is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.1. Auxiliary

functions U, V given in section 3 play a key role. If D is not a ball, we use the transmission

condition (3.4) on ∂D to get a contradiction to Hopf’s boundary point lemma. In section 4,

we prove Theorem 1.3 by following the proof of Theorem 1.1. Auxiliary functions U, V, W

given in section 4 play a key role. We notice that almost the same arguments work as in

the proof of Theorem 1.1.

2 Preliminaries for N ≥ 2

Concerning the behavior of the solutions of problem (1.1)-(1.3) and problem (1.4), we

start with the following lemma.

Lemma 2.1 Let u be the solution of either problem (1.1)-(1.3) or problem (1.4). We have

the following assertions:

(1) For every compact set K ⊂ Ω, there exist two positive constants B and b satisfying

0 < u(x, t) < Be− b

t

for every (x, t) ∈ K × (0, 1].

(2) There exists a constant M > 0 satisfying

0 ≤ 1−u(x, t) ≤ min{1, M t− N
where |Ω| denotes the Lebesgue measure of the set Ω.

2 |Ω|}

for every (x, t) ∈ Ω×(0, +∞) or ∈ RN×(0,∞),

(3) For the solution u of problem (1.1)-(1.3), there exist two positive constants C and λ

satisfying

0 ≤ 1 − u(x, t) ≤ Ce−λt

for every (x, t) ∈ Ω × (0, +∞).

(4) For the solution u of problem (1.4) where N ≥ 3, there exist two positive constants

β and L satisfying

β−1|x|2−N ≤Z ∞

0

(1 − u(x, t)) dt ≤ β|x|2−N if

|x| ≥ L,

where Ω ⊂ BL(0) = {x ∈ RN : |x| < L}.

Proof. We make use of the Gaussian bounds for the fundamental solutions of parabolic

equations due to Aronson[Ar, Theorem 1, p. 891](see also [FaS, p. 328]). Let g =
g(x, t; ξ, τ ) be the fundamental solution of ut = div(σ∇u). Then there exist two positive
constants α and M such that

M−1(t − τ )− N

2 e− α|x−ξ|2

t−τ ≤ g(x, t; ξ, τ ) ≤ M (t − τ )− N

2 e− |x−ξ|2

α(t−τ )

(2.1)

for all (x, t), (ξ, τ ) ∈ RN × (0, +∞) with t > τ .

For the solution u of problem (1.4), 1 − u is regarded as the unique bounded solution
of the Cauchy problem for the diﬀusion equation with initial data XΩ which is greater
than or equal to the corresponding solution of the initial-boundary value problem for the

4

diﬀusion equation under the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition by the comparison

principle. Hence we have from (2.1)

1 − u(x, t) =ZRN

g(x, t; ξ, 0)XΩ(ξ) dξ ≤ M t− N

2 |Ω|.

The inequalities 0 ≤ 1 − u ≤ 1 follow from the comparison principle. This completes the
proof of (2). Moreover, (4) follows from (2.1) as is noted in [Ar, 5. Remark, pp. 895–896].

For (1), let K be a compact set contained in Ω. We set

Nρ = {x ∈ RN : dist(x, ∂Ω) < ρ}

where ρ = 1

2 dist(K, ∂Ω) (> 0). Deﬁne v = v(x, t) by

v(x, t) = λZNρ

g(x, t; ξ, 0) dξ

for every (x, t) ∈ RN × (0, +∞),

where a number λ > 0 will be determined later. Then it follows from (2.1) that

v(x, t) ≥ λM−1t− N

2 ZNρ

e− α|x−ξ|2

t

dξ

for (x, t) ∈ RN × (0, +∞)

and hence we can choose λ > 0 satisfying

Thus the comparison principle yields that

v ≥ 1 on ∂Ω × (0, 1].

u ≤ v in Ω × (0, 1].

(2.2)

On the other hand, it follows from (2.1) that

v(x, t) ≤ λM t− N

2 ZNρ

e− |x−ξ|2

αt dξ

for (x, t) ∈ RN × (0, +∞).

Since |x − ξ| ≥ ρ for every x ∈ K and ξ ∈ Nρ, we observe that

v(x, t) ≤ λM t− N

2 e− ρ2

αt |Nρ|

for every (x, t) ∈ K × (0, +∞),

where |Nρ| denotes the Lebesgue measure of the set Nρ. Therefore (2.2) gives (1).

For (3), for instance choose a large ball B with Ω ⊂ B and let ϕ = ϕ(x) be the ﬁrst

positive eigenfunction of the problem

− div(σ∇ϕ) = λϕ in B and ϕ = 0 on ∂B

5

with sup
B

ϕ = 1. Choose C > 0 suﬃciently large to have

1 ≤ Cϕ in Ω.
Then it follows from the comparison principle that

1 − u(x, t) ≤ Ce−λtϕ(x)

for every (x, t) ∈ Ω × (0, +∞),

which gives (3).

The following asymptotic formula of the heat content of a ball touching at ∂Ω at

only one point tells us about the interaction between the initial behavior of solutions and

geometry of domain.

Proposition 2.2 Let u be the solution of either problem (1.1)-(1.3) or problem (1.4). Let
x ∈ Ω and assume that the open ball Br(x) with radius r > 0 centered at x is contained in
Ω and such that Br(x) ∩ ∂Ω = {y} for some y ∈ ∂Ω. Then we have:

Here, κ1(y), . . . , κN−1(y) denote the principal curvatures of ∂Ω at y with respect to the
inward normal direction to ∂Ω and C(N, σ) is a positive constant given by

(1.1)-(1.3).)

When κj(y) = 1/r for some j ∈ {1,··· , N − 1}, (2.3) holds by setting the right-hand

side to +∞ (notice that κj(y) ≤ 1/r always holds for all j’s).
Proof. For the one-phase problem, that is, for the heat equation ut = ∆u, this lemma
has been proved in [MS4, Theorem 1.1, p. 238] or in [MS5, Theorem B, pp. 2024-2025

and Appendix, pp. 2029–2032]. The proof in [MS5] was carried out by constructing

appropriate super- and subsolutions in a neighborhood of ∂Ω in a short time with the aid

of the initial behavior [MS5, Lemma B.2, p. 2030] obtained by Varadhan’s formula [V] for

the heat equation ut = ∆u

− 4t log u(x, t) → dist(x, ∂Ω)2 as t → +0 uniformly on every compact set in Ω.

(2.4)

(See also [MS5, Theorem A, p. 2024] for the formula.) Here, without Varadhan’s formula,

(1) of Lemma 2.1 replace the initial behavior [MS5, Lemma B.2, p. 2030]. We remark

that since problem (1.1)-(1.3) is one-phase with conductivity σs near ∂Ω, we can obtain
formula (2.3) for problem (1.1)-(1.3) only by scaling in t. On the other hand, problem
(1.4) is two-phase with conductivities σm, σs near ∂Ω if σm 6= σs. Therefore, it is enough
for us to prove formula (2.3) for problem (1.4) where σm 6= σs.

Let u be the solution of problem (1.4) where σm 6= σs, and let us prove this lemma by

modifying the proof of Theorem B in [MS5, Appendix, pp. 2029–2032].

Let us consider the signed distance function d∗ = d∗(x) of x ∈ RN to the boundary

∂Ω deﬁned by

d∗(x) =( dist(x, ∂Ω)
− dist(x, ∂Ω)

if x ∈ Ω,
if x 6∈ Ω.

(2.5)

Since ∂Ω is bounded and of class C 2, there exists a number ρ0 > 0 such that d∗(x) is
C 2-smooth on a compact neighborhood N of the boundary ∂Ω given by

N = {x ∈ RN : −ρ0 ≤ d∗(x) ≤ ρ0}.

(2.6)

We make N satisfy N ∩ D = ∅. Introduce a function F = F (ξ) for ξ ∈ R by

observe that for each ε ∈ (0, 1/4), there exists t1,ε ∈ (0, 1] satisfying

(±1){(v±)t − σ∆v±} > 0

(2.13)

the comparison principle over N that

By writing

This completes the proof of Proposition 2.2.

In order to determine the symmetry of Ω, we employ the following lemma.

Lemma 2.4 Let u be the solution of either problem (1.1)-(1.3) or problem (1.4). Under

the assumption (1.7) of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.3, the following assertions hold:

(1) There exists a number R > 0 such that

dist(x, ∂Ω) = R for every x ∈ Γ;

(2) Γ is a real analytic hypersurface;

(3) there exists a connected component γ of ∂Ω, that is also a real analytic hypersurface,
such that the mapping γ ∋ y 7→ x(y) ≡ y − Rν(y) ∈ Γ, where ν(y) is the outward unit
normal vector to ∂Ω at y ∈ γ, is a diﬀeomorphism; in particular γ and Γ are parallel
hypersurfaces at distance R;

(4) it holds that

max

1≤j≤N−1

κj(y) <

1
R

for every y ∈ γ,

(2.16)

where κ1(y),··· , κN−1(y) are the principal curvatures of ∂Ω at y ∈ γ with respect to
the inward unit normal vector −ν(y) to ∂Ω;

(5) there exists a number c > 0 such that

N−1

Yj=1 (cid:18) 1

R − κj(y)(cid:19) = c

for every y ∈ γ.

(2.17)

Proof. First it follow from the assumption (1.5) that

Br(x) ⊂ Ω \ D for every x ∈ ∂G with 0 < r ≤ dist(x, ∂Ω).

10

Therefore, since σ = σs in Ω \ D, we can use a balance law (see [MS2, Theorem 2.1, pp.
934–935] or [MS1, Theorem 4, p. 704]) to obtain from (1.7) that for every p, q ∈ Γ and
t > 0

ZBr(p)

u(z, t) dz =ZBr(q)

u(z, t) dz if 0 < r ≤ min{ dist(p, ∂Ω), dist(q, ∂Ω)}.

(2.18)

Let us show assertion (1). Suppose that there exist a pair of points p and q satisfying

dist(p, ∂Ω) < dist(q, ∂Ω).

Set r = dist(p, ∂Ω). Then there exists a point y ∈ ∂Ω such that y ∈ Br(p) ∩ ∂Ω.
Choose a smaller ball Bˆr(x) ⊂ Br(p) with 0 < ˆr < r and Bˆr(x) ∩ ∂Br(p) = {y}. Since
1≤j≤N−1

, by applying Proposition 2.2 to the ball Bˆr(x), we get

κj(y) ≤

On the other hand, since Br(q) ⊂ Ω, it follows from (1) of Lemma 2.1 that

u(z, t) dz = 0,

We can ﬁnd a point x∗ ∈ Γ and a ball Bρ(z∗) such that Bρ(z∗) ⊂ G and x∗ ∈ ∂Bρ(z∗).

Since Γ satisﬁes (1.6), assertion (1) yields that there exists a point y∗ ∈ ∂Ω satisfying

BR+ρ(z∗) ⊂ Ω, y∗ ∈ BR+ρ(z∗) ∩ ∂Ω, and BR(x∗) ∩ ∂Ω = {y∗}.

Here let us show that, if y ∈ γ and x = x(y), then ∇u(x, t) 6= 0 for some t > 0, which
guarantees that in a neighborhood of x, Γ is a part of a real analytic hypersurface properly
embedded in RN because of (1.7), real analyticity of u with respect to the space variables,

and the implicit function theorem. Moreover, this together with the implicit function
theorem guarantees that γ is open in ∂Ω and the mapping γ ∋ y 7→ x(y) ∈ Γ is a local
diﬀeomorphism, which is also real analytic. If we can prove additionally that γ is closed
in ∂Ω, then the mapping γ ∋ y 7→ x(y) ∈ Γ is a diﬀeomorphism and γ is a connected
component of ∂Ω since Γ is a connected component of ∂G, and hence all the remaining

assertions (2) – (5) follow from (2.18), (2.19) and the deﬁnition of γ. We shall prove this

later in the end of the proof of Lemma 2.4.

Before this we show that, if y ∈ γ and x = x(y), then ∇u(x, t) 6= 0 for some t > 0.
Suppose that ∇u(x, t) = 0 for every t > 0. Then we use another balance law (see [MS2,

Since ˆR ∈ (0, R) is arbitrarily chosen, this gives a contradiction, and hence γ is closed in
∂Ω.

Lemma 2.5 Let u be the solution of problem (1.4). Under the assumption (1.8) of Theo-

rem 1.3, the same assertions (1)–(5) as in Lemma 2.4 hold provided Γ and γ are replaced

by ∂G and ∂Ω, respectively.

Proof. By the same reasoning as in assertion (1) of Lemma 2.4 we have assertion (1)

from the assumption (1.8). Since every component Γ of ∂G has the same distance R to

∂Ω, every component Γ satisﬁes the assumption (1.6). Therefore, we can use the same

arguments as in the proof of Lemma 2.4 to prove this lemma. Here we must have

∂Ω = {x ∈ RN : dist(x, G) = R}.

3 Proof of Theorem 1.1

Let u be the solution of problem (1.1)-(1.3) for N ≥ 2. With the aid of Aleksandrov’s
sphere theorem [Alek, p. 412], Lemma 2.4 yields that γ and Γ are concentric spheres.
Denote by x0 ∈ RN the common center of γ and Γ. By combining the initial and boundary
conditions of problem (1.1)-(1.3) and the assumption (1.7) with the real analyticity in x of
u over Ω\D, we see that u is radially symmetric with respect to x0 in x on(cid:0)Ω \ D(cid:1)×(0,∞).
Here we used the assumption that Ω \ D is connected. Moreover, in view of the Dirichlet
boundary condition (1.2), we can distinguish the following two cases:

(I) Ω is a ball;

(II) Ω is a spherical shell.

By virtue of (3) of Lemma 2.1, we can introduce the following two auxiliary functions

U = U (x), V = V (x) by

U (x) =Z ∞
V (x) =Z ∞

0

(1 − u(x, t)) dt

for x ∈ Ω \ D,

(1 − u(x, t)) dt

for x ∈ D.

Then we observe that

14

Let us ﬁrst show that case (II) does not occur. Set Ω = Bρ+(x0) \ Bρ−(x0) for some
numbers ρ+ > ρ− > 0. Since Ω \ D is connected, (3.5) yields that U (ρ+) = U (ρ−) = 0
and hence c1 < 0. Moreover we observe that

U′′ < 0 on [ρ−, ρ+].

(3.8)

Recall that D may have ﬁnitely many connected components. Let us take a connected
component D∗ ⊂ D. Then, since D∗ ⊂ Ω, we see that there exist ρ∗ ∈ (ρ−, ρ+) and
x∗ ∈ ∂D∗ which satisfy

U (ρ∗) = min{U (r) : r = |x − x0|, x ∈ ∂D∗} and ρ∗ = |x∗ − x0|.

(3.9)

Notice that ν(x∗) equals either x∗−x0

ρ∗

. For r > 0, set

ρ∗

or − x∗−x0
σs

ˆU (r) = U (ρ∗) +

(U (r) − U (ρ∗)).

Since

it follows that

ˆU (r) − U (r) =(cid:18) σs

σc − 1(cid:19) (U (r) − U (ρ∗)),

ˆU( ≥ U
≤ U

if σs > σc
if σs < σc

on ∂D∗.

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

Moreover, we remark that ˆU never equals U identically on ∂D∗ since Ω \ D∗ is connected
and Ω is a spherical shell. Observe that

− ∆ ˆU =

1

and

∂ ˆU

On the other hand, we have

Then it follows from (3.12) and the strong comparison principle that

ˆU( > V

< V

if σs > σc
if σs < σc

in D∗,

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

since ˆU never equals U identically on ∂D∗. The transmission condition (3.4) with the
deﬁnition of ˆU tells us that

ˆU = V and

∂ ˆU
∂ν

=

∂V
∂ν

at x = x∗ ∈ ∂D∗,

(3.16)

15

since ν(x∗) equals either x∗−x0
. Therefore applying Hopf’s boundary point
lemma to the harmonic function ˆU − V gives a contradiction to (3.16), and hence case (II)
never occurs. (See [GT, Lemma 3.4, p. 34] for Hopf’s boundary point lemma.)

or − x∗−x0

ρ∗

ρ∗

Let us consider case (I). Set Ω = Bρ(x0) for some number ρ > 0. We distinguish the

following three cases:

(i) c1 = 0;

(ii) c1 > 0;

(iii) c1 < 0.

We shall show that only case (i) occurs. Let us consider case (i) ﬁrst. Note that

U′(r) < 0 if r > 0, and U′(0) = 0.

(3.17)

Take an arbitrary component D∗ ⊂ D. Then, since D∗ ⊂ Ω = Bρ(x0), we see that there
exist ρ∗ ∈ (0, ρ) and x∗ ∈ ∂D∗ which also satisfy (3.9). Notice that ν(x∗) equals x∗−x0
.
For r ≥ 0, deﬁne ˆU = ˆU (r) by (3.10). Then, by (3.11) we also have (3.12). Observe that
both (3.13) and (3.14) also hold true. Then it follows from (3.12) and the comparison

ρ∗

principle that

ˆU( ≥ V
≤ V

if σs > σc
if σs < σc

in D∗.

(3.18)

The transmission condition (3.4) with the deﬁnition of ˆU also yields (3.16) since ν(x∗)
equals x∗−x0
. Therefore, by applying Hopf’s boundary point lemma to the harmonic
function ˆU − V , we conclude from (3.16) that

ρ∗

ˆU ≡ V in D∗

and hence D∗ must be a ball centered at x0. In conclusion, D itself is connected and must
be a ball centered at x0, since D∗ is an arbitrary component of D.

Next, let us show that case (ii) does not occur. In case (ii) we have

U′(r) < 0 if r > 0,

lim
r→0

U (r) = +∞, and x0 ∈ D.

(3.19)

Let us choose the connected component D∗ of D satisfying x0 ∈ D∗. Then, since D∗ ⊂
Ω = Bρ(x0), we see that there exist ρ∗1, ρ∗2 ∈ (0, ρ) and x∗1, x∗2 ∈ ∂D∗ which satisfy that
ρ∗1 ≤ ρ∗2 and

U (ρ∗1) = max{U (r) : r = |x − x0|, x ∈ ∂D∗} and ρ∗1 = |x∗1 − x0|,
U (ρ∗2) = min{U (r) : r = |x − x0|, x ∈ ∂D∗} and ρ∗2 = |x∗2 − x0|.

ρ∗i

Notice that ν(x∗i) equals x∗i−x0
instance if D∗ is a ball centered at x0. For r > 0, we set
(U (r) − U (ρ∗2))
(U (r) − U (ρ∗1))

ˆU (r) =( U (ρ∗2) + σs
U (ρ∗1) + σs

Then, as in (3.12), it follows that

ˆU ≥ U on ∂D∗.

for i = 1, 2. Also, the case where ρ∗1 = ρ∗2 may occur for

σc

σc

if σs > σc ,
if σs < σc .

lim

ˆU = +∞.

(3.24)

Therefore, since we also have (3.14), it follows from (3.23) and the strong comparison

principle that

The transmission condition (3.4) with the deﬁnition of ˆU tells us that

ˆU > V in D∗ \ {x0}.

ˆU = V and

∂ ˆU
∂ν

=

∂V
∂ν

at x = x∗i ∈ ∂D∗,

(3.25)

(3.26)

since ν(x∗i) equals x∗i−x0
for i = 1, 2. Therefore applying Hopf’s boundary point lemma
to the harmonic function ˆU − V gives a contradiction to (3.26), and hence case (ii) never
occurs.

ρ∗i

It remains to show that case (iii) does not occur. In case (iii), since c1 < 0, there exists

a unique critical point r = ρc of U (r) such that

U (ρc) = max{U (r) : r > 0} > 0 and 0 < ρc < ρ ;
U′(r) < 0 if r > ρc and U′(r) > 0 if 0 < r < ρc ;

lim
r→0

U (r) = −∞ and x0 ∈ D.

(3.27)

(3.28)

(3.29)

Let us choose the connected component D∗ of D satisfying x0 ∈ D∗. Then, since D∗ ⊂
Ω = Bρ(x0), as in case (ii), we see that there exist ρ∗1, ρ∗2 ∈ (0, ρ) and x∗1, x∗2 ∈ ∂D∗
which satisfy (3.20) and (3.21). In view of the shape of the graph of U , we have from the
transmission condition (3.4) that at x∗i ∈ ∂D∗, i = 1, 2,

(3.30)

where, in order to see that ν(x∗i) equals x∗i−x0
if ρ∗i 6= ρc, we used the fact that both D∗
and Bρ(x0) \ D∗ are connected and x0 ∈ D∗. Also, the case where ρ∗1 = ρ∗2 may occur
for instance if D∗ is a ball centered at x0. For r > 0, we deﬁne ˆU = ˆU (r) by

ρ∗i

ˆU (r) =( U (ρ∗1) + σs
U (ρ∗2) + σs

σc

σc

(U (r) − U (ρ∗1))
(U (r) − U (ρ∗2))

if σs > σc ,
if σs < σc .

Remark that (3.31) is opposite to (3.22). Then, as in (3.23), it follows that

ˆU ≤ U on ∂D∗.

(3.31)

(3.32)

Hence, by proceeding with the strong comparison principle as in case (ii), we conclude

that

ˆU < V in D∗ \ {x0}.

(3.33)

Then, it follows from the deﬁnition of ˆU and (3.30) that (3.26) also holds true. In con-
clusion, applying Hopf’s boundary point lemma to the harmonic function ˆU − V gives a
contradiction to (3.26), and hence case (iii) never occurs.

4 Proof of Theorem 1.3

Let u be the solution of problem (1.4) for N ≥ 3. For assertion (2) of Theorem 1.3, with
the aid of Aleksandrov’s sphere theorem [Alek, p. 412], Lemma 2.4 yields that γ and Γ
are concentric spheres. Denote by x0 ∈ RN the common center of γ and Γ. By combining
the initial condition of problem (1.4) and the assumption (1.7) with the real analyticity
in x of u over RN \ D coming from σs = σm, we see that u is radially symmetric with
respect to x0 in x on (cid:0)RN \ D(cid:1) × (0,∞). Here we used the assumption that Ω \ D is

connected. Moreover, in view of the initial condition of problem (1.4), we can distinguish

the following two cases as in section 3:

(I) Ω is a ball;

(II) Ω is a spherical shell.

For assertion (1) of Theorem 1.3, with the aid of Aleksandrov’s sphere theorem [Alek, p.

412], Lemma 2.5 yields that ∂G and ∂Ω are concentric spheres, since every component of

∂Ω is a sphere with the same curvature. Therefore, only the case (I) remains for assertion
(1) of Theorem 1.3. Also, denoting by x0 ∈ RN the common center of ∂G and ∂Ω and
combining the initial condition of problem (1.4) and the assumption (1.8) with the real
analyticity in x of u over Ω \ D yield that u is radially symmetric with respect to x0 in x
on (cid:0)RN \ D(cid:1) × (0,∞).

18

By virtue of (2) of Lemma 2.1, since N ≥ 3, we can introduce the following three

auxiliary functions U = U (x), V = V (x) and W = W (x) by

0

U (x) =Z ∞
V (x) =Z ∞
W (x) =Z ∞

for x ∈ D,
for x ∈ RN \ Ω.

Then we observe that

in Ω \ D, −∆V =

where ν = ν(x) denotes the outward unit normal vector to ∂D at x ∈ ∂D or to ∂Ω at
x ∈ ∂Ω and (4.5) - (4.6) are the transmission conditions. Here we used (4) of Lemma 2.1
to obtain (4.7).

Let us follow the proof of Theorem 1.1. We ﬁrst show that case (II) for assertion (2) of
Theorem 1.3 does not occur. Set Ω = Bρ+(x0) \ Bρ−(x0) for some numbers ρ+ > ρ− > 0.
Since u is radially symmetric with respect to x0 in x on (cid:0)RN \ D(cid:1)× (0,∞), we can obtain
from (4.4)-(4.7) that for r = |x − x0| ≥ 0
U = c1r2−N − 1
2N σs
W = c3r2−N

r2 + c2

for ρ− ≤ r ≤ ρ+,
for r ≥ ρ+,
for 0 ≤ r ≤ ρ−,

W = c4

where c1, . . . , c4 are some constants, since Ω \ D is connected. Remark that U can be
extended as a radially symmetric function of r in RN \ {x0}. We observe that c4 > 0 and
c3 > 0. Also it follows from (4.6) that U′(ρ−) = 0 and U′(ρ+) < 0, and hence

c1 < 0 and U′ < 0 on (ρ−, ρ+].

Then the same argument as in the corresponding case in the proof of Theorem 1.1 works

and a contradiction to the transmission condition (4.5) can be obtained. Thus case (II)

for assertion (2) of Theorem 1.3 never occurs.

19

Let us proceed to case (I). Set Ω = Bρ(x0) for some number ρ > 0. Since u is radially

symmetric with respect to x0 in x on (cid:0)RN \ D(cid:1) × (0,∞), we can obtain from (4.4)-(4.7)
that for r = |x − x0| ≥ 0

U = c1r2−N − 1
2N σs
W = c3r2−N

r2 + c2

for x ∈ Ω \ D,
for r ≥ ρ,

where c1, c2, c3 are some constants, since Ω \ D is connected. Remark that U can be
extended as a radially symmetric function of r in RN \ {x0}. Therefore it follows from
(4.6) that U′(ρ) < 0. As in the proof of Theorem 1.1, We distinguish the following three
cases:

(i) c1 = 0;

(ii) c1 > 0;

(iii) c1 < 0.

Because of the fact that U′(ρ) < 0, the same arguments as in the proof of Theorem 1.1
works to conclude that only case (i) occurs and D must be a ball centered at x0.
