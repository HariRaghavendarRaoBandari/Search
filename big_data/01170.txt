Abstract

Nonlinear ion-acoustic cnoidal wave structures are studied in an unmagnetized quantum plasma.

Using the reductive perturbation method, a Korteweg-de Vries equation is derived for appropri-

ate boundary conditions and nonlinear periodic wave solutions are obtained. The corresponding

analytical solution and numerical plots of the ion-acoustic cnoidal waves and solitons in the phase

plane are presented using the Sagdeev pseudo-potential approach. The variations in the nonlinear

potential of the ion-acoustic cnoidal waves are studied at diﬀerent values of quantum parameter

He which is the ratio of electron plasmon energy to electron Fermi energy deﬁned for degenerate

electrons. It is found that both compressive and rarefactive ion-acoustic cnoidal wave structures

are formed depending on the value of the quantum parameter. The dependence of the wavelength

and frequency on nonlinear wave amplitude is also presented.

INTRODUCTION

The study of nonlinear wave propagation in quantum plasmas has gain importance due

its application in understanding the particle or energy transport phenomenon on short scale

lengths i.e., in micro and nano scale electronic devices and in dense compact stars [1–7].

Typically, the quantum eﬀects in plasmas become important when the Fermi temperature,

which is related to the particles density, becomes equal or greater than the system’s thermal

temperature or the inter-particle distance becomes smaller or of the same order of the par-

ticle’s de Broglie thermal wavelength. In order to study the dynamics in quantum plasmas,

the quantum hydrodynamic (QHD) model is frequently used [1, 2, 6]. The QHD model

consists of a set of equations describing the transport of charge, momentum and energy in a

quantum charged particle system interacting through a self consistent electromagnetic ﬁeld.

In QHD model, the quantum eﬀects appear through the quantum statistical (Fermi) pres-

sure and the Bohm potential (due to quantum diﬀraction or tunneling eﬀects). The QHD

is useful to study collective eﬀects on short scale lengths and has its limitation for systems

that are large compared to the Fermi Debye lengths of the species in the system. Quantum

ion-acoustic waves were investigated by Haas et al. [1, 2] using the QHD model. They de-

rived a Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation in the weakly nonlinear amplitude wave limit for

studying the propagation of ion-acoustic solitons in a quantum plasma. It is reported that

the compressive or rarefactive soliton solution depends on a quantum parameter (He) de-

ﬁned for degenerate electrons, which is the ratio of the electron plasmon energy to the Fermi

energy. In the fully nonlinear regime, the existence of periodic traveling wave patterns were

reported for ion-acoustic waves in quantum plasmas. The arbitrary amplitude ion-acoustic

solitary waves using the QHD model in electron-ion quantum plasmas with the Sagdeev po-

tential approach has also been investigated [8]. Nonlinear electrostatic wave structures such

as solitons, envelope and shocks have been studied in quantum electron-ion (EI) plasmas [9]

but no one has reported the propagation of cnoidal wave structures in quantum plasmas.

The purpose of the present work is to investigate the formation of ion-acoustic cnoidal waves

in a quantum EI plasma using the well known QHD model.

In classical plasmas, a lot of research work has been done in studying nonlinear ion-

acoustic wave structures such as solitons, cnoidal waves and envelopes. Solitons are single

pulse structures which are formed due to the balance between nonlinearity and dispersion

2

eﬀects in the system [10] and they consist of isolated hump or dip like wave proﬁle with

no rapid oscillations inside the packet. Envelope structure contains both fast and slow

oscillations, obtained when nonlinearity balances the wave group dispersion eﬀects. The

envelope is a localized modulated wave packet whose dynamics is governed by the nonlinear

Schr¨odinger (NLS) equation [11, 12]. The periodic (cnoidal) wave is the exact nonlinear

periodic wave solution of the KdV equation with appropriate boundary conditions. These

solutions of the KdV equation are also termed as cnoidal waves because they are written in

terms of Jacobian elliptic-function cn. In general, the nonlinear periodic waves are expressed

in terms of Jacobian elliptic-functions such as dn, sn or cn, and the nonlinear dn waves are

believed to be generated in the defocusing region of the ionospheric plasmas [13–16]. The

ion-acoustic soliton and double layer structures are observed in auroral and magnetospheric

plasmas and also nonlinear periodic wave signals appear frequently in these observations

[17]. The periodic signals are also observed at the edge of the tokamak plasma, which can

be described by cnoidal waves [18]. Kono et al. [19] studied the higher order contributions

in the reductive perturbation theory for the nonlinear ion-acoustic wave propagation under

the periodic boundary condition. The nonlinear periodic wave solution for small amplitude

Langmuir waves in electron-ion plasmas was studied by Schamel [20]. Jovanovic and Shukla

[21] presented a solution in the form of a cnoidal wave provided the minimum value of the

electrostatic potential remain ﬁnite in studying coherent electric ﬁeld structures. Prudskikh

[22] studied the ion-acoustic nonlinear periodic waves in dusty plasmas. The ion-acoustic

cnoidal wave and the associated nonlinear ion ﬂux in dusty plasmas was studied by Jain et al.

[23]. They derived the coupled evolution equations for the ﬁrst and second order potentials

for ion-acoustic waves in unmagnetized dusty plasmas using reductive perturbation method

with appropriate boundary conditions. Kaladze at al.

[24] investigated acoustic cnoidal

waves and solitons in unmagnetized pair-ion (PI) plasmas consisting of the same mass ion

species with diﬀerent temperatures. They reported the formation of both compressive and

rarefactive cnoidal wave structures in PI plasmas which depends on the temperature ratio

of PI species. Recently, Kaladze and Mahmood [25] studied the eﬀect of positrons density

and nonthermal parameter kappa on the propagation of the ion-acoustic cnoidal waves in

electron-positron-ion plasmas. Saha and Chatterjee studied electron acoustic periodic and

solitary wave solutions in unmagnetized [26] and magnetized [27, 28] quantum plasmas.

They derived a KdV equation using the reductive perturbation method and investigated the

3

associated nonlinear structures using bifurcation theory.

The manuscript is organized in the following way. In the next section, the model and set

of dynamic equations for studying nonlinear ion-acoustic waves in unmagnetized quantum

plasmas is presented. Using the reductive perturbation method, the KdV equation is also

derived with appropriate boundary conditions. In Section III, the stationary wave solution

is obtained for ion-acoustic cnoidal waves using the Sagdeev potential approach. In Section

IV, the numerical analysis and plots are presented for degenerate plasma cases at diﬀerent

plasma densities chosen from literature and the conclusion is drawn in the ﬁnal Section V.

II. BASIC MODEL AND DERIVATION OF KORTEWEG-DE VRIES EQUA-

TION

In order to study the electrostatic nonlinear periodic (cnoidal) waves in unmagnetized

electron-ion (EI) quantum plasmas, we will derive a KdV equation using the reductive

perturbation method. A KdV equation for quantum ion-acoustic waves has already been

derived by Haas et al.

[2] with emphasis on localized solutions obtained under decaying

boundary conditions. For cnoidal waves, periodic boundary conditions are more appropriate,

hence we will derive again the KdV equation for quantum ion-acoustic waves. The set of

dynamic equations for ion-acoustic wave using QHD model is described as follows.

The ion continuity and momentum equations for ion ﬂuid are given by

The Poisson equation is written as

∂2φ
∂x2 =

(ne − ni),

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

where φ is the electrostatic potential. The ion ﬂuid density and velocity are represented by

ni and ui respectively, while ne is the electron ﬂuid density. Also, me and mi are the electron

4

and ion masses, −e is the electronic charge, ε0 and ℏ are the dielectric and scaled Planck’s
constants. In equilibrium, we have ne0 = ni0 = n0 (say). Here pe is the electron pressure

and pe(ne) is obtained from the equation of state for the electron ﬂuid. The electrons are

assumed to obey the equation of state pertaining to one-dimensional zero-temperature Fermi

gas [2, 3], which is pe = mev2

F en3

e/3n2

0 where n0 is the equilibrium plasma density. Here vF e

is the Fermi velocity of electron, connected to the Fermi temperature by mev2

F e/2 = kBTF e
and kB is the Boltzmann constant. The last term on the right hand side of the momentum

equations for electrons quantum ﬂuid is the quantum force, which arises due to the quantum

Bohm potential and gives quantum diﬀraction or quantum tunneling eﬀects due to the wave-

like nature of the charged particles. The quantum eﬀects due to ions are ignored in the model

as they have large inertia in comparison with the electrons.

In order to ﬁnd the nonlinear ion-acoustic periodic waves in a quantum plasma, the set

of nonlinear dynamic equations are written in a normalized form as follows,

respectively, and the non-dimensional quantum parameter for electrons is deﬁned as

He = ωpe/2kBTF e i.e., the ratio of electron plasmon energy to the Fermi energy, here

ωpe = (n0e2/ε0me)

1/2

is the electron plasma frequency. The normalization of electron and

ion ﬂuid density is deﬁned as ˜nj = nj/n0 (j = e, i). In the following, for simplicity we will

not use the tilde sign.

In order to ﬁnd an nonlinear evolution equation, a stretching of independent variables x,

t is deﬁned as follows [10],

ξ = ε1/2(x − V0t) ,

τ = ε3/2t,

5

where ε is a small parameter and V0 is the phase velocity of the wave to be determined later

on. The perturbed quantities can be expanded in the powers of ε,

ni1 = 1 + εni1 + ε2ni2 + ...,

ne1 = 1 + εne1 + ε2ne2 + ...,

ui = εui1 + ε2ui2 + ...,

Φ = εΦ1 + ε2Φ2 + ...

Moreover, ∂/∂x = ε1/2 ∂/∂ξ and ∂/∂t = ε3/2∂/∂τ − V0ε1/2∂/∂ξ.

From ion continuity and momentum equations the lowest order (∼ ε3/2) terms gives

∂ui1
∂ξ

∂Φ1
∂ξ −

+

∂Φ1
∂ξ

∂ne1
∂ξ

= 0.

The lowest order (∼ ε) term of Poisson equation gives

ni1 = ne1.

Multiplying Eq. (10) by V0 and adding with Eq. (11), we have

∂ni1
∂ξ

=

V 2

∂Φ1

Using Eqs. (12), (13) and (14), we have

V0 = ±1.

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

which is the normalized phase velocity of the ion-acoustic wave. From now on, we set V0 = 1

without loss of generality.

Now integrating Eqs. (11), (12), (14) and using (13) we have

and

ni1 = ne1 = Φ1 + c1(τ )

ui1 = Φ1 + c2(τ ),

(16)

(17)

where c1(τ ) and c2(τ ) are at this point arbitrary functions of τ only.

Applying periodic boundary conditions we get ∂c1/∂τ = ∂c2/∂τ = 0, so that the functions

c1 and c2 become independent of both ξ and τ and are from now on constants.

Diﬀerentiating Eq. (21) and using Eqs. (24) and (25), and after some simpliﬁcations,

we have the KdV equation for the nonlinear dynamics of ion-acoustic waves in a quantum

plasma as follows,

where

(26)

(27)

Here Φ1 has been replaced by Φ.

In the above KdV equation (26), the term containing an arbitrary constant c0 can be

removed with a Galilean transformation. Hence we can set c0 = 0 without loss of generality.

It can be noticed easily from dispersive coeﬃcient D that the cnoidal wave solution exist
only when He 6= 2, so that the dispersive coeﬃcient does not disappear to balance the
nonlinearity.

III. NONLINEAR PERIODIC WAVE SOLUTIONS

In order to ﬁnd the steady state cnoidal and solitary waves solutions of the KdV Eq.

(26) for quantum ion-acoustic waves, we follow the same procedure as already done in
Refs.[24, 25]. Assume a solution Φ(η), where η = ξ − uτ and u is the velocity of the
nonlinear structure moving with the frame. Therefore, Eq. (26) can be written as

D

d3Φ
dη3 +

d

dη(cid:0)Φ2 − uΦ(cid:1) = 0.

(28)

As said, the arbitrary constant c0 has been ignored, since it gives just a shift in the velocity

of the nonlinear structure.

After integration of Eq. (28), we get the equation of a conservative nonlinear oscillator

i.e.,

where its potential energy W = W (Φ) is deﬁned as

d2Φ
dη2 = −

dΦ

W (Φ) =

3D

Φ3 −

2D

Φ2 + ρ0Φ.

(29)

(30)

Here ρ0 is an integration constant. The potential function W (Φ) has two points of extremum
for Φ i.e. Φ = ˜Φ1,2 deﬁned by ∂W/∂Φ = 0, which are given by

˜Φ1,2 =

u

2 ±r u2

4 − Dρ0.

(31)

Thus, there are two equilibrium states. One of them deﬁnes a saddle point while the other one
represents a center point i.e., the bottom of the potential well [24]. Moreover u2/4−Dρ0 > 0
must hold for real values. The zero’s of the potential energy (30) i.e., Φ = z1, z2, z3 are given

8

as follows,

z1 = 0 ,

z2,3 =

3

2 u

2 ±ru2
4 −

4
3

Dρ0! .

(32)

To get the shape of the real potential well u2/4 − 4Dρ0/3 > 0 must holds. Note that the
potential well having the center for Φ > 0 (positive) deﬁnes the compressive cnoidal waves

and solitons, while in the case of Φ < 0 (negative) the potential well deﬁnes the rarefactive

cnoidal waves and solitons [24]. The shape of the potential well strongly depends on the sign

of dispersive coeﬃcient D (see Eq. (30)). As described in Eq. (27), the value of the dispersive

coeﬃcient D in the KdV equation is positive for electron quantum parameter He < 2 case,

while it becomes negative for He > 2. Therefore, the formation of compressive or rarefactive

ion-acoustic nonlinear structure depends on the value of the quantum parameter He. The

amplitude of the nonlinear structures is deﬁned by the width of the potential well, which is

the length between the last zero of the potential well and the saddle point (see Eqs. (31)

and (32)).

The energy ﬁrst integral associated to (29) is

Eqs. (34)-(36), we have the following relation,

u =

3

(Φ0 + Φ1 + Φ2).

The periodic (cnoidal) wave solution of Eq. (36) is given [29] by

Φ(η) = Φ1 + (Φ0 − Φ1)cn2(Rη, s),

where cn is the Jacobian elliptic function, s is the modulus deﬁned as

s2 =

(Φ0 − Φ1)
(Φ0 − Φ2)

< 1,

and the quantity R =q 1

6D (Φ0 − Φ2).

The amplitude A of the cnoidal wave is deﬁned from Eq. (40) as follows,

A = Φ0 − Φ1.

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

As it is seen from the solution (40) at η = 0, we have the initial condition Φ(0) = Φ0. In
addition, the real numbers Φi (i = 0, 1, 2) are ordered as Φ0 > Φ1 ≥ Φ2 and Φ1 ≤ Φ ≤ Φ0
for D > 0.

The modulus 0 < s < 1 is a measure of the nonlinearity of the wave. The case s << 1

corresponds to the weakly nonlinear oscillations near the bottom of the potential well and
the elliptic functions are close to trigonometric ones. At s → 0, the expression (40) passes
to solution of linear equations [29].

The wavelength λ of the cnoidal waves is deﬁned as

λ = 4s 3D

2(Φ0 − Φ2)

K(s),

(43)

where K(s) is the complete elliptic integral of the ﬁrst kind and the corresponding frequency

is f = v1/λ (where v1 is the velocity of the cnoidal waves). The velocity v1 of the cnoidal

waves in the laboratory frame is equal to v1 = V0 + u, where the expression for the frame

velocity u is given by,

u =

(2 − s2) + 2Φ2,

(49)

From Eq. (48), we see that Φ1 deﬁnes the potential at η → ±∞.

Thus, at large values of s i.e., s → 1, A = const the periodic wave asymptotically
approaches to the sequence of solitons having the amplitude A (relatively to the level Φ =
¯Φ = Φ1). By the order of magnitude, the distance between them is equal to

where △ is the width of the soliton already deﬁned above.

IV. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS

(50)

The numerical plots of the nonlinear wave potential and the phase plane plots of the

cnoidal wave structures and solitons are shown in Figs.1-3 at diﬀerent densities for a de-

generate electron plasma cases, such as astrophysical plasmas, laser plasmas and ultra-cold

11

plasmas. For a completely degenerate electron plasma, the electron Fermi energy and den-

sity are related as kBTF e = ℏ2(3π2n0)2/3/2me and the Fermi temperature of degenerate

electrons (TF e) should be much greater than the thermal temperature T of the system i.e.,
T ≪ TF e. The quantum parameter for electrons is related to density as He ∼ n−1/6
shows that in a completely degenerate electron plasma case, the value of the quantum pa-

, which

0

rameter decreases with the increase in the plasma density. So the quantum diﬀraction eﬀects

tend to be less relevant in dense plasmas. In case of astrophysical plasma conditions i.e.,

n0 = 1036m−3, the quantum parameter for degenerate electrons comes out to be He = 0.05

and the condition for thermal temperature becomes T << 109K, while for laser plasmas we

have n0 = 1032m−3 then He = 0.24 and T << 107K. Further, for ultra-cold plasmas, we
have n0 = 2.7 × 1026m−3 for which He = 2.002 and T << 1800K [30, 31].

The formation of ion-acoustic compressive (rarefactive) nonlinear structures depends on

the value of the quantum parameter for electrons i.e., He < 2 (He > 2). It is also noticed that

the velocity of the nonlinear structure is positive i.e., u > 0 for compressive cnoidal waves
and solitons with quantum parameter for degenerate electrons lies in the range 0 ≤ He < 2.
For the He > 2 case, rarefactive ion-acoustic cnoidal waves and solitons structures are formed

and its solution exist only when the velocity of the nonlinear structure is negative u < 0 i.e.,

it moves in the backward direction.

It can be seen from Figs. 1a and 2a that the Sagdeev potential W (Φ) are formed for

Φ > 0 for the electron quantum parameter values He = 0.05 and 0.24. The corresponding

compressive ion-acoustic cnoidal wave (solid curve) and solitons (dotted curve) structures

are shown in the phase plane plots of Fig. 1b and 2b respectively. The cnoidal wave structure

(solid bounded curve) is formed inside the separatrix (dotted curve) which represent a soliton

structure as shown in the ﬁgures. The Sagdeev potential plot W (Φ) is formed with Φ < 0

for the electron quantum parameter value He = 2.002 (> 2) as shown in the Fig. 3a.

The corresponding rarefactive ion-acoustic cnoidal wave (solid bounded curve) and soliton

(dotted curve) structures in the phase plane plot are shown in the Fig. 3b. Rarefactive

nonlinear ion-acoustic cnoidal wave (solid bounded curve) structures are also formed inside

increase in the value of quantum parameter is shown in the Fig. 4b. Similarly, the plots for

the rarefactive ion-acoustic cnoidal wave and soliton structures for He > 2case are shown in

the Figs. 5a and 5b respectively. It can be seen from the Fig. 5a that wavelength (frequency)

of the rarefactive ion-acoustic cnoidal wave increases and its amplitude decreases signiﬁcantly

with the little increase in the value of quantum parameter for He > 2 case. Also, the decrease

in the wave amplitude as well as increase in the width of the rarefactive ion-acoustic soliton

with the increase in the value of quantum parameter is shown in Fig. 5b.

The variations of the wavelength and frequency with wave amplitude of the compressive

ion-acoustic cnoidal waves at diﬀerent quantum parameters are shown in Fig. 6a and 6b,

respectively. It can be seen from the ﬁgures that the wavelength increases, while the fre-

quency decreases with the increase in the amplitude. Also, the decrease in the wavelength

and increase in the wave frequency is found with the increase in the electron quantum pa-

rameter for compressive (He < 2) ion-acoustic cnoidal waves case. However, this decrease

in the wavelength and increase in the wave frequency with the wave amplitude for the ion-

acoustic compressive cnoidal waves case seems to be very small at the chosen degenerate

plasma densities as indicated in Figs. 6a and 6b. The dependence of the wavelength and

at quantum parameters with values He > 2 are shown in Figs. 7a and 7b, respectively.

The wavelength increases while the frequency decreases with the increase in the amplitude

of the rarefactive ion-acoustic cnoidal waves in quantum plasmas. On the other hand, the

wavelength is found to be increased, while frequency decreases for rarefactive ion-acoustic

cnoidal waves case with the increase in the value of the quantum parameter for degenerate

electrons as shown in the Figs. 7a and 7b.

V. CONCLUSION

To conclude, we have studied for the ﬁrst time the ion-acoustic cnoidal waves and soli-

tons in an unmagnetized quantum plasma. The KdV equation for ion-acoustic waves in a

quantum plasma was obtained using the reductive perturbation method with periodic wave

boundary conditions, appropriate to study cnoidal waves. It is found that both compressive

and rarefactive nonlinear ion-acoustic cnoidal wave structures are formed in such a degener-

ate plasma, which depends on the quantum parameter i.e., He ≷ 2. The dependence of wave

frequency and wavelengths on the nonlinear ion-acoustic wave amplitude is also investigated

at diﬀerent values of quantum parameters with the degenerate plasma densities exist in

astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. It is found that the dependencies of wavelength and

frequency on wave amplitude at diﬀerent quantum parameters for electrons behave diﬀer-

ently for compressive and rarefactive ion-acoustic cnoidal wave cases. The results are useful

to understand how nonlinear wave propagates in quantum plasmas.
