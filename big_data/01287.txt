Abstract

Current bounds from the polarization of the CMB predict the scale-invariant gravita-

tional wave (GW) background of inﬂation to be out of reach for upcoming GW interfer-

ometers. This prospect dramatically changes if the inﬂaton is a pseudoscalar, in which

case its generic coupling to any abelian gauge ﬁeld provides a new source of GWs, directly

related to the dynamics of inﬂation. This opens up new ways of probing the scalar poten-

tial responsible for cosmic inﬂation. Dividing inﬂation models into universality classes,

we analyze the possible observational signatures. One of the most promising scenarios

is Starobinsky inﬂation, which may lead to observational signatures both in direct GW

detection as well as in upcoming CMB detectors. In this case, the complementarity be-

tween the CMB and direct GW detection, as well as the possibility of a multi-frequency

analysis with upcoming ground and space based GW interferometers, may provide a ﬁrst

clue to the microphysics of inﬂation.

Introduction

The recent ﬁrst detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by the LIGO/VIRGO collabora-

tion [1] has opened up a fascinating new window to the very early universe. Unlike any other

messenger, GWs can travel freely through the Universe, carrying information on times as

early as cosmic inﬂation. They are thus a unique and ultimate probe of any model of cosmic

inﬂation. Current indirect bounds on primordial GWs, obtained from bounds on the Cosmic

Microwave Background (CMB) polarization, indicate that the nearly scale-invariant spectrum

of the vacuum ﬂuctuations during standard slow-roll inﬂation lies below the range of current

and upcoming direct GW detectors. This picture may however change dramatically once

1

interactions of the inﬂaton with other particles are taken into account [2].

To this end, we consider the generic coupling of a pseudoscalar inﬂaton φ to the ﬁeld strength
tensor F µν of any gauge groups of the theory,

Lint ∼ φFµν ˜F µν .

(1)

Such pseudoscalar (or ‘axionic’) ﬂat directions, suitable for inﬂation, may be expected to be

abundant at the high energy scales of cosmic inﬂation. The coupling to gauge ﬁelds, even to

the SM gauge ﬁelds, is then allowed by all symmetries of the theory and unavoidable from

the point of view of eﬀective ﬁeld theory.

The presence of the interaction term (1) has a dramatic impact on the predictions of a given

inﬂation model, classiﬁed by its scalar potential V (φ). This coupling to the gauge ﬁelds

leads to a tachyonic instability for one of the gauge ﬁeld modes and consequently to a non-

perturbative production of the gauge ﬁeld during inﬂation [3–5]. This in turn back-reacts on

the dynamics of the inﬂaton [6–8], the usual Hubble friction term is superseded by a new

friction term sourced by the gauge ﬁelds. Moreover, the gauge ﬁelds provide an additional

source of tensor perturbations, leading to a potentially large enhancement of the resulting

GW signal [9].

We analyze the consequences of this for the predictions of cosmic inﬂation. So far, in this

context the focus has mainly been on models of Chaotic inﬂation, see e.g. [8, 10, 11], which

have served as useful toy-models to illustrate many of the relevant eﬀects. In this paper, we

take a broader approach, identifying universal features shared by all pseudoscalar single-ﬁeld

slow-roll inﬂation models but also pointing out how a coupling as in Eq. (1) can be an in-

triguing possibility to distinguish diﬀerent inﬂation models. To this end, we group inﬂation

models in terms of universality classes [12,13] and analyze their parameter dependencies both

analytically and numerically. In particular many of our analytical results are derived with

basically no assumptions on the underlying inﬂation model, and may thus easily be adapted

to speciﬁc models of interest. Our main results are on the CMB observables and the GW

spectrum, but we also consider constraints from primordial black hole formation, the gener-

ation of primordial magnetic ﬁelds and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints.

Among the diﬀerent universality classes, we ﬁnd Starobinsky inﬂation [14] to be the most

promising from the point of view of possible observations - remarkably just the model which

is one of the most favoured by the recent results of the Planck satellite [15]. In this case,

2

the complementarity between direct and indirect searches of GWs at various frequencies, to-

gether with further CMB observations, will cover a signiﬁcant part of the parameter space in

the near future. Key experiments in the next decade will be ground- and space based GW

experiments, as well as 4th generation CMB experiments.

This paper is organized as follows. We begin with a brief review of pseudoscalar single-ﬁeld

slow-roll inﬂation in the presence of the interaction (1) in Sec. 2. This sets the stage to

derive model-independent, analytical expressions for the most important quantities in Sec. 3.

In Sec. 4 we specify the relevant universality classes of inﬂation and proceed with a full

numerical analysis of representative models, demonstrating also the validity of our analytical

expressions. Some of the details are relegated to the appendix. Finally, we discuss further

implications of our results in Sec. 6, considering also a possible embedding into a broader

picture, both from the point of view of particle physics model building as well as for early

universe cosmology. Special attention is given to the Starobinsky model, for which we present

a full parameter scan investigating the observational prospects. We conclude in Sec. 7.

2 Review of the mechanism.

The production of gauge ﬁeld quanta during inﬂaton has been studied in Refs. [3–5]. The

resulting GW spectrum was analyzed in [9], with the backreaction of the gauge ﬁelds on

the inﬂationary dynamics considered in [6–8]. Recently, the diverse phenomenology of this

setup has received a lot of attention, including the study of primordial black hole (PBH)

formation and CMB non gaussianities [10, 11, 16]. In this section we review the dynamics

of the background ﬁelds and their ﬂuctuations, setting the stage for our analysis of inﬂation

models in Secs. 3 and 4.

ﬁeld coupling. For simplicity, we will consider αa = α for all a = {1, 2, ..N} in the following.

Assuming ˙φ is a slowly varying function in time, we can solve the equation for (cid:126)A analytically.
The Fourier modes of (cid:126)A must satisfy:

Here the subscript ± refers to the two helicity modes of the massless gauge ﬁeld ( (cid:126)Aa =
(cid:126)e±Aa± exp(i(cid:126)k(cid:126)x)). The corresponding helicity vectors (cid:126)e±((cid:126)k) satisfy (cid:126)k × (cid:126)e± = ∓ik(cid:126)e∓, turning
the cross-product in Eq. (4) (arising in turn from the antisymmetric -tensor in ˜Fµν) into the
± in Eq. (6). This leads to a tachyonic instability in the A+ mode (for ˙φ < 0) and hence to
an exponential growth of one of the two helicity modes of the vector ﬁeld,

(10)

Typically the eﬀect in the Friedmann equation is small. However, in the slow-roll equation

for the inﬂaton, this introduces an additional friction term which can slow down inﬂation
signiﬁcantly as ξ ∼ | ˙φ|/H increases towards the end of inﬂation. Inﬂation then extends for
∆N∗ additional e-folds, implying that for a given scalar potential, the point where the CMB

e-folds (NCMB (cid:39) 60) after the CMB scales exited the horizon, but these are now divided
among N∗ efolds of standard inﬂation governed by the Hubble friction and ∆N∗ e-folds of
inﬂation governed by the gauge ﬁeld induced friction, see also Fig. 1.

2.2 Scalar and tensor perturbations

Expressing the pseudoscalar ﬁeld as φ(t, x) = φ(t) + δφ(x, t) the equation of motion for the

scalar ﬂuctuations reads:

with

¨δφ + 3H ˙δφ + (−∇2 + V (cid:48)(cid:48)(φ))δφ = − α

δ[ (cid:126)Ea (cid:126)Ba] ,

δ[ (cid:126)Ea (cid:126)Ba] = [ (cid:126)Ea (cid:126)Ba − (cid:104) (cid:126)Ea (cid:126)Ba(cid:105)]δφ=0 +

∂(cid:104) (cid:126)Ea (cid:126)Ba(cid:105)

∂ ˙φ

˙δφ .

(11)

(12)

In the regime of strong gauge ﬁelds, Eq. (11) can be solved approximately by considering only

the second term on the lefthand side, as well as the gauge ﬁeld terms on the righthand side,

.

At large scales, gauge contributions are small and the spectrum approaches the scale-invariant

spectrum of the standard vacuum ﬂuctuations during inﬂation. At small scales, the gauge

contributions dominate and the spectrum is given by:

s(k) (cid:39)
∆2

N (2πξ)2 .

(15)

Note that the gauge ﬁelds aﬀect the scalar spectrum in twofold way: by modifying the

background slow-roll equation of motion and by modifying the equation of motion for the

ﬂuctuations directly. A more reﬁned calculation of the solution to Eq. (11) can be found

in [8], with which the estimate above agrees up to an order one factor.

The tensor ﬂuctuations are governed by the linearized Einstein equation [17]:

Here Πij
ab is the transverse, traceless projector and Tab is the energy momentum tensor sourcing
the gravitational waves. Eq. (16) is solved by employing the Greens function Gk(τ, τ1) for the
corresponding homogeneous diﬀerential equation,

dτ1Gk(τ, τ1)Πab

(17)

(cid:90)

hij(k, τ ) =

Inserting the background solution for the gauge ﬁelds, the amplitude of the tensor perturba-

tions is given by (see e.g. [7, 8]):

(18)

with ΩR,0 = 8.6 · 10−5 denoting the radiation energy density today and MP = 2.4 · 1018 GeV
denoting the reduced Planck mass, which in the following expressions we will set to unity.

Here the ﬁrst term in the bracket is the usual vacuum contribution from inﬂation, whereas

the second term is sourced by the contribution of the gauge ﬁelds to the anisotropic stress

energy tensor.

Finally, to depict the power spectra as a function of frequency, we employ:

N = NCMB + ln

kCMB

,

(19)

with kCMB = 0.002 Mpc−1 and NCMB ∼ 50 − 60. In this convention, the number of e-folds
N decreases during inﬂation, reaching N = 0 at the end of inﬂation.

3 General analytical results.

In the equations of Sec. 2, the inﬂaton potential V (φ) was not further speciﬁed. Let us now

turn to this point in more detail. We will follow the classiﬁcation of inﬂation models of

Ref. [12, 13], which covers the vast majority of single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation models and is

based on expressing the ﬁrst slow-roll parameter  as

where βp is a positive constant and p is an integer and

(20)

(21)

The parametrization of the slow-roll parameters in powers of 1/N is a natural way to parametrize

the observed smallness of the slow-roll parameters at the CMB-scales while accounting for an

increase over the course of inﬂation, required to end inﬂation [12, 13, 18]. In the following, we

6

will focus on inﬂation models obeying Eq. (20) but otherwise keep the function V (φ) com-

pletely general. This enables a very general analysis of pseudoscalar inﬂation, with all the

dependence on the underlying inﬂation model encoded in the parameters p and βp.

The parametrization of Eq. (20) is particularly convenient for analysis since the parameter ξ

(cf. Eq. (8)), governing the strength of the gauge ﬁeld production, can be expressed as

ξ ∝ √

φ .

(22)

As can be seen from Eqs. (13), (15) and (18), the evolution of this parameter is crucial for

the background dynamics as well as for the scalar and tensor spectrum. As long as the gauge
ﬁelds are sub-dominant, ξ grows as 1/N p/2. Once the gauge ﬁelds become signiﬁcant, their

backreaction eﬀects the background evolution leading to a slower growth in ξ. This evolution

of ξ is reﬂected in the scalar and tensor power spectrum.

In this section, we will analytically examine the evolution of ξ and the resulting universal

features in the scalar and tensor power spectrum. The starting point is the equation of
motion (3), which, employing dN = −H dt, can be expressed as

(23)

We will distinguish three regimes: In regime (A), vacuum ﬂuctuations dominate and the

eﬀects of the gauge ﬁelds are negligible. In regime (B), the contributions to the power spectra

from the gauge ﬁelds overcome those stemming from the vacuum ﬂuctuations. For both (A)

and (B) we may neglect the gauge contribution on the righthand side of Eq. (23). In regime

(C), backreaction eﬀects of the gauge ﬁelds on the inﬂation dynamics become important,

and we may instead neglect the ﬁrst term on the lefthand side, corresponding to the Hubble

friction. To facilitate orientation, a schematic overview of the evolution of φ and ξ is depicted

in Fig. 1. The meaning of marked values of N and ξ will be explained below. For simplicity
we set N = 1 in the remainder of this section.

inﬂation due to the friction of the gauge ﬁelds, cf. Fig. 1. We will deﬁne the end of this

regime based on the GW spectrum (18), i.e.

power law regime (B)

As ξ > ξ1, the contribution from the gauge ﬁelds begins to dominate the GW spectrum.
In this regime, as long as the additional friction in Eq. (3) is small, the equation of motion

Eq. (24) still holds and the evolution of ξ is still well described by Eq. (28), leading to a

strongly blue scalar and tensor spectrum. Regime (B) lasts until the gauge ﬁeld friction term

in Eq. (23) overcomes the Hubble friction, i.e. for

This value for ξ can be translated into a value for N and f according to Eqs. (28) and (19),

after evaluating the (model dependent) value of H at this point.

The corresponding value for φ2 = φ(N2) (and analogously φ1) can be obtained by solving the
slow-roll equation of motion Eq. (24). The constant of integration, i.e. the value of φ(N∗) can
be calculated from the α = 0 dynamics taking into account the shift ∆N∗.

strong gauge ﬁeld regime (C)

Finally we consider the regime ξ2 < ξ. The non-linear friction term in Eq. (23) becomes
dominant, leading to |φ,N| (cid:28) |V,φ/V |,

During slow-roll inﬂation, the lefthand side of this equation changes only moderately with
time, bounded from above by the vacuum solution V (cid:48)/V ∼ 1/N p/2. This implies that ξ can
grow at most logarithmically with decreasing N in this regime.5 This lasts until inﬂation
ends, i.e. as long as 0 < ¨a, that is H = | ˙H|/H 2 < 1. Saturating this bound yields an upper
bound for ξ: With ˙H (cid:39) V (cid:48) ˙φ/(6H) and hence V (cid:48) (cid:46) 3H 2α/(ξΛ), the equation of motion (30)
implies

ξ < ξmax ,

N · 2.4 · 10−4H 2 .

(31)

In the parameter regime of interest, ξmax > 1, this implies that low-scale models of inﬂation
allow for larger values of ξ and hence for stronger eﬀects due to the presence of gauge ﬁelds.

The bound (31) has interesting consequences for the scalar and tensor power spectrum. In
this regime, the scalar power spectrum is given by Eq. (15), i.e. it is proportional to 1/ξ2.

From Eq. (31) we hence see that the scalar power at small scales (a potentially dangerous

source of primordial black holes) is suppressed in low-scale models of inﬂation. Note in par-

ticular that the bound (31) and hence the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum in this

regime are independent of the parameter α.

Moreover, inserting Eq. (31) into Eq. (18) implies an absolute upper bound on ΩGW ,

ΩGW h2 (cid:46) 2.4 · 10−5N −1 ,

(32)

5A useful analogy is an object falling in some medium. As in this case, the friction-dependent velocity term
leads to an approximately constant asymptotic velocity φ,N ∼ ξ. Note that the friction term in this regime
is stronger than required by the usual assumptions made in slow-roll inﬂation, which lead to neglecting the
¨φ-term.

9

which holds independently of the inﬂation model. Here, as in Eq. (31), we have exceptionally
re-introduced the parameter N to emphasize the parameter dependence of this bound. Since
this bound is saturated at the end of inﬂation, this maximal value moreover is reached at a

universal frequency. Inserting N = 0 into Eq. (19) yields
fmax (cid:39) 3.6 · 108 Hz .

(33)

Next let us consider the inﬂationary dynamics in the strong gauge ﬁeld regime. With ξ

approximately constant, we can estimate

(34)
with | ¯φ,N| = 2 ¯ξΛ/α, ¯ξ = (ξmax + ξ2)/2. With this we can estimate the amount of e-folds in
this strong gauge ﬁeld regime,

φ (cid:39) ¯φ,N N + φ0,

N2 = (φ2 − φ0)

α
,
2Λ ¯ξ

(35)

with φ0 denoting the value of the inﬂaton ﬁeld at the end of inﬂation, to good approximation
determined by V = 1. As above, the value of N can be translated into the corresponding
frequency. Moreover, by solving the vacuum slow-roll dynamics between φ2 and φ0 using
Eq. (24), i.e. setting α = 0, we can ﬁnally determine ∆N∗ as

∆N∗ = N2 − N 0
2 ,

(36)

with N 0

2 the numer of e-folds elapsed between φ2 and φ0 for α = 0. Reinserting this value
into the above expressions of regime (A) and (B), we obtain an analytical description of all

the relevant points in scalar and tensor spectrum.

3.2 The scalar and tensor spectra

The scalar power spectrum is observed to be nearly scale-invariant around the CMB pivot
s (cid:39) 2.2 · 10−9. Within the framework of Eq. (20), the tilt of this
scale with an amplitude of ∆2

spectrum is obtained as

ns (cid:39) 1 − O(1)
N∗

,

(37)
with the O(1) - factor depending on the choice of inﬂation model. Including the eﬀects of the
gauge ﬁeld production, N∗ = NCMB − ∆N∗ < NCMB, and hence the spectral index decreases
compared to the α = 0 case. The observed value of ns thus imposes an upper bound on ∆N∗.
The precise value depends on the O(1) in Eq. (37), but typically we ﬁnd ∆N∗ (cid:46) 10 − 20.
Consequently, this constrains the value of N2 through Eq. (36) and implies an upper bound
on α/Λ in Eq. (35).

Figure 2: Schematic view of the gravitational wave spectrum for two diﬀerent values of p in Eq. (20) and two

diﬀerent values of the inﬂaton - gauge ﬁeld coupling α/Λ.

Equipped with the results of Sec. 3.1, we now turn to the prediction of the GW spectrum

ΩGW, see also the schematic depiction in Fig. 2. Here we show the GW spectrum for two
diﬀerent values of p with p1 (blue) smaller than p2 (purple). The dashed curves refer to
reducing the value of α/Λ with respect to the corresponding solid curves.

At very small frequencies, corresponding to the CMB scales, the amplitude is governed by the
ﬁrst slow-roll parameter and is hence to good approximation proportional to βp/N p
CMB. cf.
Eq. (25) (regime A). At very large frequencies, corresponding to scales exiting the horizon to-

wards the end of inﬂation, the universal value Ωmax is slowly approached, cf. Eq. (32) (regime
C). In between, there is a steep increase of the spectrum, governed by the 1/N p/2 growth of ξ

(regime B). This increase last from ξ = ξ1 to ξ = ξ2, cf. Eqs. (26) and (29). Inﬂation models
with a higher value of p in Eq. (20) correspond to a lower scale of inﬂation H1 thus leading to
a smaller value of ξ1.6 For a ﬁxed value of ξCMB, this shifts f1 to smaller values, as illustrated
in Fig. (2). Additionally, a larger value of p implies a steeper slope of the spectrum between f1
and f2, due to the faster growth of ξ. As a result, the plateau in the spectrum, corresponding
to an approximately constant value of ξ, extends to lower frequencies in these models. This

leads to the interesting conclusion that models with a lower (vacuum) tensor-to-scalar ratio

r = 16 actually have the larger GW signal in this setup. Besides the value of p, the second

important parameter is ξCMB or equivalently α/Λ. As can be seen from Eq. (28), reducing
this values corresponds to shifting N1 (and correspondingly N2) to smaller values, i.e. shifting

f1 and f2 to higher frequencies.

Finally, the moderate increase in ΩGW between f2 and fmax may be traced back to the
moderate incrase of ξ in that region, compensated to some extent by a decreasing Hubble

parameter. Comparing Eqs. (29) and (31) yields

With φ2

,N ∼ (V (cid:48)/V )2 ∼  ∼ r, we note that low-scale models which allow for an early and

steep rise of the spectrum at the same time require a smaller value of ξ2.

In summary, p controls the slope of the strong increase in the scalar and tensor spectrum,

α/Λ shifts the entire spectrum horizontally and βp vertically shifts the vacuum part of the
spectrum. It is the interplay of these three parameters which controls the detectability of the

GW signal.

4 Numerical results for explicit models.

In this section we show the results obtained when we consider some speciﬁc inﬂationary

potentials. In particular we are interested in observing the diﬀerences in the GW production

as we consider diﬀerent inﬂationary models. As we have discussed in the previous sections,

we expect the shape of the GW spectrum to be particularly sensitive to α/Λ and p. As most

of the models discussed in literature [8, 10, 11] have p = 1, in this work we are interested in

considering some models with a diﬀerent value for this parameter. To produce a classiﬁcation

of models in terms of p we use the parametrization of Eq. (20). It is then useful to recall the

approximate relationship between the potential V (φ) and the number of e-folds N :

To solve this diﬀerential equation we must distinguish p = 2 from all the other cases.

To complete our classiﬁcation we can use the expression of V given in Eq. (21) to constrain
the expression for V (φ). In particular it is easy to show that for chaotic models [19] with

potential:

V (φ) = V0 φq,

(44)

we get p = 1. To consider diﬀerent values of p we can start by noticing that Starobinsky

model [14]:

V (φ) = V0

(45)

corresponds to p = 2. It is interesting to point out that this result holds for a more general
class of models7 with:

4.1 CMB constraints and numerical results.

Before turning to the particular models with diﬀerent values for p, it is useful to recall the

conditions that must be satisﬁed in all of these cases. In particular all the models must be

in agreement with three constraints coming from CMB observations. It is crucial to stress

that all the quantities appearing in these constraints should be evaluated at horizon crossing.

According to the discussion of Sec. 3, this corresponds to using the complete evolution (23)
and evaluating quantities at N = NCM B. However it is useful to point out that if ∆N∗ is
considerably smaller than NCMB (cid:39) 60, in this regime the gauge ﬁeld contribution is fairly
negligible. Under this assumption, a good estimate of the following constraints can be ob-

tained by using the standard vacuum slow-roll evolution (24) and evaluating quantities at

7In the rest of this paper we always use the term Starobinsky model to refer to this general class of models.

N = N∗. As in our numerical simulations we have used the complete evolution, we provide
these constraints in the most general form. However, for the estimates of Sec. 4.2, we use
their approximated expression in terms of N∗.

• COBE Normalization: It sets the value of the scalar power spectrum at the CMB
scales. This condition can be used to ﬁx a constraint on the inﬂationary potential. In

particular we have [15]:

(cid:12)(cid:12)N =NCM B

∆2
s

= (2.21 ± 0.07) · 10−9 .

(48)

• Planck measurements: These further constrain the spectral index ns, the running of

the spectral index αs and the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, deﬁned as

ns − 1 =

d ln ∆2

αs =

r =

(49)

The constraints on these parameters from the Planck mission [15] read (at 68% CL for

ns and αs, 95% CL for r):

ns = 0.9645 ± 0.0049 ,

αs = −0.0057 ± 0.0071 ,

r < 0.10 .

(50)

In slow-roll approximation and for a negligible gauge ﬁeld contribution at the CMB

scales, the quantities above are given by:

ηV as:

Figure 3: Evolution of inﬂaton ﬁeld φ as a function of N and f (see Eq .(19)) for the Starobinsky model

with (solid line) and without (dashed line) the non-minimal interaction with the gauge ﬁelds. We show the
evolution for the case with α/Λ ∼ 75, γ = 0.3, V0 (cid:39) 1.17 · 10−9.

The evolution of φ for the Starobinsky model is shown in Fig. 3. These and the following

results have been obtained by numerically solving the slow-roll equation of motion (23) for a
ﬁxed parameter point.8 As expected, the coupling between the gauge ﬁeld and the inﬂaton

only eﬀects the last part of the evolution. In particular it slows down the variation of φ and

stretches the length of inﬂationary phase. Similar plots for models with diﬀerent values for p

are presented in Appendix A.

In Figs. 4, 5 and 6 we present ξ, ∆2

s and ΩGW respectively for the models with p = 1, 2, 3, 4.
As anticipated in Sec. 3, the plots for ξ for all the diﬀerent models are approximately resem-

bling the plot of Fig. 1. In particular, we can immediately notice that the plot of Fig. 4 is in

agreement with the estimate of Eq. (31): namely, models with lower values for H (i.e. Hilltop

models with p = 3, 4) have a bigger value for ξmax. We can also notice that the value of ξCMB
for the diﬀerent models are respecting the condition of Eq. (54).

As it is possible to see from Fig. 5, we ﬁx the parameters of our models in order to ﬁt the
COBE normalization at N (cid:39) 60. Moreover, all of these spectra are nearly ﬂat in order to
respect the constraints of Eq. (50). In agreement with the estimate of [11], the value of ∆2
s on
small scales is proportional to ξ−2 and thus the corresponding value for the Hilltop models
tends to be smaller. It is worth to point out that all of the models considered in this paper

8Here we have set NCMB = 60. As discussed in Sec. 6, there is a degeneracy between the choice of NCMB

and α/Λ.

are in tension with the estimated PBH bound of [11] when we restrict to the case N = 1. As
this discrepancy is however only by a O(1) factor, it can both be addressed by taking into
account the theoretical uncertainties in the PBH bound (see also Sec. 5) or by considering
models with N > 1. As evident from the ﬁgure, the scalar spectrum for the Hilltop models

Table 1: Conﬁgurations of the planned space-based GW mission eLISA considered in this paper.

The GW spectrum for all the models considered in this paper is shown in Fig. 6. In agreement

with the discussion of Sec. 3.2, all of these models are reproducing the schematic behavior

shown in Fig. 2. In particular we can always appreciate two abrupt changes in the slope of

the curves for two diﬀerent values of the frequency. Further we depict in Fig. 6 the sensitivity

curves of a selection of current (solid lines) and upcoming (dashed lines) direct GW detectors.

tivity of SKA [23]. This is followed by space-based GW interferometers in the milli-Hz range

(eLISA [24]) and ground-based detectors sensitive at a few 10 Hz (LIGO/VIRGO [25]). For

eLISA, we depict the sensitivity curves for the four conﬁgurations listed in Tab. 1. For LIGO,

we depict the current bound O1:2015-16, as well as the expected sensitivities for the runs

O2:2016-17 an O5:2020-22. Note that the GW signal generated in this setup is maximally

chiral, distinguishing it from other stochastic GW backgrounds.

Fig. 6 clearly shows that, with a particular parameter choice, both the Quadratic and

Starobinsky model can be in the observable window for eLISA and advanced LIGO. More-

over, this particular set of parameters for the Starobinsky model happens to produce a GW

spectrum that can be observed by the milli-second pulsar timing. On the contrary, the GW

spectrum for the Hilltop models is well outside the observable windows for all of these exper-

iments.

In the remainder of this section we discuss the particular parameter choice for the case of

Starobinsky model with potential given by Eq. (45), as this seams to be the most interesting

class of models from the point of view of potentially observable signatures. In particular, we

want to show that the estimates presented in Sec. 3 are coherent with the numerical results

that we have obtained. An analogous treatment for all the other models shown in the plots of

this section is presented in Appendix A. It is important to stress that through these estimates

we have been able to ﬁx the parameters in order to maximize the GW signal without violating

the constraints of Eq. (50), Eq. (48) and Eq. (54). It is then possible to reduce the signal

basically by reducing the value of α/Λ, thus shift the rise in the spectrum to larger frequencies.

A numerical scan of the parameter space will be presented in Sec. 6, the execution of which is

however greatly facilitated by the use the analytical expressions obtained below to determine

the parameter space of interest.

imposing the latter to get :

N∗ (cid:39) 50,

(cid:46) γ2.

(57)

(58)

(59)

All of these conditions can be satisﬁed with an appropriate choice for the free parameter α/Λ.
In the following we show the results obtained by imposing α/Λ ∼ 75, γ = 0.3, V0 = 1.17·10−9.
This choice for α/Λ is motivated by the constraints of ns and r set by Eq. (50). In particular
this corresponds to ns = 0.960, r = 0.036 and αs ≡ dns/d ln k = 0.00352.

The value of ξ1 can be estimated by substituting V0 into Eq. (26):

1 = 1.68 · 10−16 · exp (4πξ1) ,
ξ6

−→

ξ1 (cid:39) 3.49.

(60)

To estimate the value of ξmax we start by estimating the value of V (φ) at the end of inﬂation.
For this purpose we simply assume V (φmax) (cid:39) V0. We can then use Eq. (31) to get:

max (cid:39) 2.77 · 10−15e2πξmax,
ξ3

−→

ξmax (cid:39) 6.21.

The value of ξ2 can be estimated from Eq. (29). Again we assume V (φ) (cid:39) V to get:

2 (cid:39) 8.77 · 10−11e2πξ2,
ξ5

−→

ξ2 (cid:39) 4.96,

φ2 (cid:39) 6.52.

(61)

(62)

To estimate φ2, we need an approximated expression for V (φ), for this purpose we can use
Eq. (21) to get φ2 (cid:39) 5.70. Finally, as in ﬁrst part of the evolution ξ is given by Eq. (22), we
can estimate the value for ξ∗ by using Eq. (21).

The estimated values for N2, and N1 and ∆N∗ are obtained by using Eq. (35), Eq. (28) and
Eq. (36): N2 (cid:39) 38.27, ∆N∗ (cid:39) 17.01, N1 (cid:39) 47.81. The corresponding frequencies are given by
Eq. (19):

(63)

f1 (cid:39) 6.23 · 10−13 Hz,

f2 (cid:39) 8.66 · 10−9 Hz.

As it is possible to see from Fig. 6, these estimates are approximatively matching the values

for these two frequencies in the full numerical computation.

5 Further experimental signatures and bounds.

In this section we discuss the constraints imposed by some experimental observations on the

production of gauge ﬁeld quanta during inﬂaton. The ﬁrst part of this section is used to

present a more detailed discussion on the non gaussianity bound of Sec. 4. We proceed by

reviewing the constraints imposed by the non-observation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs)

and by indirect searches for gravitational waves. We conclude by considering the possibility

of generating primordial magnetic ﬁelds at the end of inﬂation.

Non gaussianities.

As the gauge ﬁeld contribution to the scalar power spectrum is non-gaussian, it is strongly

constrained at the CMB scales (and LSS scales). The dominant non-gaussian contribution is
N L | < |−4±43|
denoted with f equil
at 68% CL. As widely discussed in literature [7, 8, 10, 11], we can express the three point

N L . Plack measurements [15] constrain this quantity to be |f equil

function as:

N L (cid:39) 6.16 · 10−16e6πξ/ξ9 ,

s is governed by the vaccuum contribution and constrained
by Eq. (48) at the horizon crossing of the CMB modes. This directly implies ξ < 2.5 (95 %

where we have exploited that ∆2

CL, gaussian errors assumed). It is worth to stress that Eq. (64) only applies in the weak
gauge regime. On the contary in the strong gauge ﬁeld regime we have f equil

N L = −1.3 ξ [9].

Primordial black holes.

As discussed in the previous sections, the increase of ξ towards the end of inﬂation implies a

strong rise in the scalar power spectrum. These strong perturbations on small scales in turn

can lead to the formation of primordial black holes. The non-observation of PBHs can be

used to set some constrains on the fraction of energy going into PBHs at their formation, as

a function of the PBH mass. Constraints over a wide mass range have been collected in [26].

We can roughly divide the PBHs into three categories:

• PBHs with masses smaller than 1015 g. These PBHs have already evaporated and they

can be detected observing their entropy production in the early universe.

• PBHs with masses around 1015 g. These PBHs would be evaporating today and thus

they would leave signals in γ-rays.

• PBHs with masses bigger than 1015 g. As these PBHs would still be stable, they can

be searched for in lensing experiments.

20

To estimate the the fraction of PBHs we follow the treatment of [11]. As usual we deﬁne
ζ ≡ −Hδφ/ ˙φ and ζc, critical value leading to black hole formation. Given P (ζ), probability
distribution for ζ, we can express b, fraction of space that can collapse and form a PBH, as:

(cid:90) ∞

ζc

b =

P (ζ)dζ.

(65)
Hawking evaporation and present day gravitational eﬀects constrain b, leading to b (cid:46) 10−28−
10−5 depending on the PBH mass range, with the strongest bounds coming from CMB
anisotropies [26]. According to the discussion presented in [11], this can be translated into a
(cid:46) 1.3 · 10−4 − 5.8 · 10−3.9 Following the analysis
constraint on the scalar power spectrum ∆2
s
of [11], it is also possible to associate the typical mass of a PBH with a given scale of the

scalar perturbations sourcing it (and hence a corresponding value of N ) through:

4π
H

eaN ,

MP BH =

(66)
where a = {2, 3} is a coeﬃcient depending on the eﬃciency of the reheating. Since the PBH
bound is strong for relatively light PBHs, this puts a strong constraint on the amplitude
of the scalar perturbations at the end of inﬂation. Using the approximation for ∆2

s in the
strong gauge ﬁeld regime this constraint can be used to directly put a lower bound on ξmax
i.e. ξmax (cid:38) 14/

√N .

It should be stressed that the calculation of PBH formation in these models is based on the

strong gauge ﬁeld regime, and the approximations performed in calculating this bound are

estimated to account for up to an order one factor in the ﬁnal bound [11]. Moreover, as we will

return to in the following section, the large amplitude of the scalar perturbations reached in

this regime indicates that higher orders in the perturbative expansion may not be completely

negligible. Ignoring these also contributes to the theoretical error in this regime. For these

reasons, we depict the value of the bound derived in [11] in Fig. 5, but consider all the models

discussed in this paper (which all violate this bound by an order one factor) as still viable.

Finally, note that the large scalar perturbations we obtain on small scales also source sizable

second order tensor perturbations [27].

In the models considered in this paper, these are

however subdominant compared to the leading order GW contribution calculated above.

CMB and BBN bounds on primordial GWs.

A further bound on primordial gravitational waves is imposed by the CMB and BBN con-

straints on additional massless degrees of freedom. As GWs with frequencies larger then

where the integral is performed over all frequencies f (cid:38) 10−15 Hz (f (cid:38) 10−10 Hz) for the
CMB (BBN) bound, see eg. Ref. [28] for a review. Assuming a ﬂat spectrum, this implies
ΩGWh2 < 1.7 · 10−6 [29] in the case of the CMB and ΩGWh2 < 5 · 10−6 [28] for BBN. From
Fig. 6 we see that our GW spectra exceed this value for the last few e-folds of inﬂation, at

very high frequencies. Since however these spectra are far from ﬂat, this is not in violation

of the above constraints.

Primordial magnetic ﬁelds.

As a pseudoscalar inﬂaton should couple to all the U (1) gauge ﬁeld in the theory, it can also

couple to the SM electromagnetic one. The gauge ﬁeld production discussed in this paper

could hence generate primordial magnetic ﬁelds. The generation of primordial magnetic

ﬁelds in the model of our interest has been widely discussed in literature, see e.g. [5, 30–32].

The result of these analysis is that, except for particular conﬁgurations, the magnetic ﬁelds

generated with this mechanisms turn out to be too weak to provide the seeds for the observed

ﬁelds in galaxies and clusters.

6 Discussion.

The analysis above has revealed some universal features of pseudoscalar inﬂation as well as
shed light on the existing parameter dependencies and degeneracies. As φ → 1 is a universal
feature at the end of inﬂation, the asymptotic value for the GW spectrum at large frequencies

does not depend on the underlying model of inﬂation and is insensitive to the variation of

the coupling parameter α/Λ over a large range. Reducing the value of α/Λ however bans

the increase in the GW spectrum to higher frequencies, moving it out of the range of con-

ceivable detectors. A further remarkable feature is that low-scale inﬂation models, which

feature a small tensor-to-scalar ratio, actually are more likely to yield a detectable GW signal

in this setup due to an earlier and sharper rise of the GW spectrum - however in this case

also the spectral index receives a stronger modiﬁcation. Taking these two competing eﬀects

into account, the most promising model among discussed in this paper is the pseudoscalar

Starobinsky model, allowing for a possible detection in ground-based and space-based interfer-

ometers as well as (marginally) in millisecond pulsar-timing arrays. This implies a remarkable

complementarity between direct searches for GW and searches through CMB polarization for

22

r (cid:38) 10−3. Moreover, with the ongoing upgrades, LIGO/VIRGO is expected to reach a sensi-
tivity to detect or rule out the p = 1 and p = 2 case in the next few years, if α/Λ is sizable.

In the case of a positive detection, the upcoming eLISA mission would potentially allow to

diﬀerentiate between these two cases, as well as constrain the value of α/Λ.

The complementarity of CMB measurements and direct gravitational wave searches is made

explicit in Fig. 7 for the Starobinsky class of models (p = 2). In the parameter space spanned

by α/Λ and γ, we numerically solve the equation of motion (23) for the inﬂaton ﬁeld, ﬁxing

V0 (iteratively) to the value required by the COBE normalization. Fig. 7 shows constraints
from CMB measurements (ξCMB, ns, r) as well as constraints and the projected sensitivity
of direct gravitational wave detectors (eLISA and LIGO/VIRGO). The solid blue lines corre-

viable parameter space of this model, and they are beginning to corner the parameter space

In summary, very diﬀerent measurements are just starting to probe the

from diﬀerent directions: as searches for non gaussianities in the CMB and direct gravita-

tional wave detection probe the region of large α/Λ, searches for GWs in the CMB constrain

the small γ region. A more precise measurement of ns could further narrow down the viable
range for α/Λ. Note that a similar analysis can be performed for the Hilltop models, with

the corresponding parameter space spanned by α/Λ and v. However for ns > 0.9, this class
of models features an unobservably small GW signal in the sensitivity bands of eLISA and

LIGO. Moreover, the tensor to scalar ratio is typically unobservably small and the spectral
index lies below the observed value - generic features of models with p ≥ 3.

We now turn to the consequences for inﬂationary model building. A further universal feature

of this setup is the reduction of the spectral index ns. This may move inﬂationary models
with a too ﬂat (red) spectrum, such as e.g. supersymmetric hybrid inﬂation [33–35] with
ns (cid:39) 0.98, right into the sweet spot of the Planck CMB constraints. The observed reduction
of ns, parameterized by a reduction of the eﬀective number of e-folds N∗ = NCMB − ∆N∗
for a given inﬂation model, is degenerate with the uncertainties in the reheating phase which

determine NCMB, the total number of e-folds of inﬂation. For a given inﬂation model, the
parameter α hence allows to shift the predictions in the ns - r - plane along the “N = 50−60”
lines depicted e.g. in Fig. 12 of [15].

In our analysis of inﬂation models we have pursued a phenomenological approach, classifying

inﬂation models by Eq. (20) and studying in detail some well-known representative examples.

A powerful tool on how to construct such models in a top-down approach has been put for-

ward in Ref. [11]. When constructing inﬂation models in supergravity, a common strategy

to protect the ﬂatness of the inﬂationary trajectory is to invoke a shift-symmetry. Impos-

ing this symmetry for the imaginary instead of the real part of the scalar component of the

inﬂaton superﬁeld supplies the desired pseudoscalar inﬂaton. A further concrete realization

in supergravity, based on a superconformal symmetry, can be obtained from Ref. [36]. Here

the asymptotic behaviour of the Starobinsky potential is reproduced from a superconformal

supergravity setup. Choosing χ, the superconformal symmetry breaking parameter, to be pos-

itive ﬂips the role of real and imaginary part of the complex scalar compared to the original

setup of Ref. [36], yielding an interesting implementation of pseudoscalar Starobinsky inﬂaton.

So far, our focus has been mainly on the very early epoch of cosmic inﬂation. But what is

24

the fate of the produced gauge ﬁelds after the end of reheating? In the simplest case, the

U(1) gauge group is identiﬁed with SM hypercharge. In this case, the large abundance of
gauge ﬁelds produced by the φ ˜F F interaction during inﬂation as well as in the inﬂaton decay
after the end of inﬂation will quickly populate the thermal bath [7]. This suggests a very
eﬃcient reheating mechanism with an equation of state of ω (cid:39) 1/3. Further implications of
such a coupling to SM gauge groups are the presence of primordial magnetic ﬁelds and even

a possible contribution to baryogenesis, see e.g. [37–39] for recent works. However it is also

possible to imagine more complicated scenarios. Additional U (1) symmetries may be present

(and maybe even expected from the point of view of string theory at the high energy scales
of cosmic inﬂation), broken spontaneously after the end of inﬂation.10 Depending on their
couplings to the SM, the corresponding gauge bosons will decay into SM particles11 or into

some hidden sector, contributing either to reheating or to dark matter.

These details of the reheating have an important impact on the GW spectrum, which we

have neglected so far. Eq. (18) is based on some assumptions. Calculating the GW power

spectrum today requires two ingredients: the power spectrum of the tensor ﬂuctuations at the

time of creation, i.e. when they exited the horizon during inﬂation, and the transfer function,

which encodes the red-shift of the GW from horizon re-entry until today. The latter is given

by:

k (cid:39) ΩR,0
T 2

gk∗
g0∗

g0∗,s
gk∗,s

(cid:32)

(cid:33)4/3

,

(68)

for modes k re-entering during the radiation dominated regime. Here g∗ (g∗,s) counts the
eﬀective degrees of freedom entering the energy density (entropy) of the thermal bath. The

superscript indicates evaluation at tk when the mode k re-enters the horizon or today (t0),
respectively. For modes entering earlier, during the reheating phase, the transfer function

depends on the respective equation of state. E.g. for a matter dominated reheating phase,
there is a suppression factor of (kRH /k)2. Eq. (18) hence assumes instantaneous reheating
or a reheating phase with ω = 1/3.12 Analogous to the GW signal from the vacuum ﬂuc-

tuations during inﬂation, a deviation from this can lead to a suppression of the spectrum
for frequencies larger than frh (cid:39) 0.4 Hz (TRH/107 GeV), with TRH denoting the reheating
10In this case cosmic strings will be produced. Their non-observation in the CMB constrains the symmetry

breaking scale to be around or below the GUT scale.

11An interesting example for such an additional U (1) with couplings to the SM is the U (1)B−L, with B-L
denoting the diﬀerence of baryon and lepton number, see [40, 41] for possible further implications for early

universe cosmology.

also omitted in Eq. (18).

temperature [42–45]. For GUT-scale models of infation, such as Starobinsky inﬂation, this

may hide a potential signal from the LIGO band, but typically not from the eLISA band

located at lower frequencies.

Recently, Ref. [46] raised the question of the possible breakdown of a perturbative analysis for

large values of ξ as we consider in this paper towards the end of inﬂation. To clarify this point,

we stress that while we assume perturbativity in the inﬂaton and tensor ﬂuctuations, the gauge

ﬁeld production is an inherently non-perturbative process. We do not attempt a perturbative

analysis of the gauge ﬁeld, but work with the classical, non-perturbative background solution.

In particular, the requirement of perturbativity of the inﬂaton ﬂuctuations imposes:

δφ (cid:46) Λ/α .

(69)

Throughout most of the evolution of the inﬂaton ﬁeld, this is easily fulﬁlled. Note however

that towards the end of inﬂation, inserting the asymptotic behaviour for the scalar power

(70)

Hence perturbativity is merely ensured by a factor of 1/π, implying a potentially signiﬁcant
theoretical uncertainty in the asymptotic value of the scalar power spectrum13. This is in

particular relevant in view of the PBH bound in this regime.

An obvious extension of the framework discussed in this paper is to consider the coupling of

the pseudoscalar inﬂaton to non-abelian gauge groups. Initially, as long as the amplitude of

the gauge ﬁeld modes is small, the system will behave as in the Abelian case. However, as the

exponential growth sets in, the non-abelian nature becomes important. Similar situations have

been studied in lattice simulations for explosive gauge ﬁeld production through preheating,

both for the case of parametric resonance [47] and a tachyonic instability [48], ﬁnding that

the non-abelian interaction terms lead to a redistribution of the mode population towards

higher values of k. In addition, eﬀective mass terms may shut of the tachyonic instability

prematurely. These arguments indicate that the GW production should be less eﬃcient in the

non-abelian case. However since the simple estimates of Sec. 2 no longer apply, a quantitative

analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, possibly requiring dedicated lattice simulations.

13Notice that to obtain Eq. (70) we use [11]:

A similar analysis can be carried out for tensor ﬂuctuations. With (cid:104)h(x)2(cid:105) (cid:39) C∆2
factor, and using Eq. (32), we can show that perturbativity is ensured for C (cid:46) 105 .

7 Conclusion and Outlook.

In this paper we have presented an updated discussion of a pseudoscalar inﬂaton non-

minimally coupled with gauge ﬁelds. As widely discussed in literature, the resulting generic

production of gauge ﬁeld quanta during inﬂation sensitively aﬀects the scalar and GW spec-

tra. In particular, this system features a tachyonic instability that leads to an exponential

enhancement in the spectra as the inﬂaton speed increases towards the end of inﬂation. As

a result, if the intensiﬁcation is suﬃciently strong, GWs produced with this mechanism can

be observed with GW detectors such as LISA and advanced LIGO. Further striking obser-

vational signatures include the reduction of the spectral index ns, the enhancement of the
tensor-to-scalar ratio r and the generation of non gaussianities in the CMB.

Our analysis clariﬁes the parameter dependencies of these predictions due to the underlying

inﬂation model. Classifying inﬂation models according to Ref. [12], cf. Eq. (20), we quantify

the eﬀect of considering diﬀerent universality classes of inﬂation (labeled by the parameter

p) as well as varying the parameters within a given class. This study has both been per-

formed analytically in Sec. 3 and through numerical calculations, whose results are shown

in Sec. 4. From the point of view of potential experimental signatures, we ﬁnd that p = 2

(Starobinsky inﬂation) is the most promising candidate - a model which has recently received

a lot of attention as it lies just in the sweet plot of the ns/r region preferred by Planck. As
we show in Fig. 7, this model may lead to detectable chiral GW signals in both advanced

LIGO and eLISA, with the parameter space further narrowed down by future CMB missions

constraining r and ns. For a sizable value of the inﬂaton gauge ﬁeld coupling α/Λ, this model
is a fascinating candidate for multi messenger and multi frequency signals of cosmic inﬂation.

In this paper we have performed a comprehensive discussion of the possibility of introducing a
non-minimal coupling proportional to φ ˜F F between a pseudoscalar inﬂaton and some gauge
ﬁelds. Embedding this into a complete early time cosmological scenario confronts this setup

with a number of constraints, as detailed in Secs 4, 5 and 6. In this paper, our main focus

is on consequences related to cosmic inﬂation, involving a broad range of CMB observables

and GW signatures. In particular our analytical results may serve as guidelines for further

inﬂation model building in this framework. Furthermore, it would be interesting to study in

more detail the subsequent reheating phase as well as a possible connection to baryogenesis.

In this light, not only connections to other eras of the early universe but also the concrete

realization within particle physics models, identifying in particular the possible nature of the

gauge group(s), poses interesting questions for future work.

A Analytical estimates for models with p (cid:54)= 2.

In this appendix we present the analysis of the models of Sec. 4. In particular we use the

estimates of Sec. 3 to explain the particular choice for the parameters used in the numerical
simulations. The plots for ξ, ∆2

s and ΩGW are shown in Sec. 4, in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Fig. 6
respectively. The plots for the evolution of φ as a function of N for all the models discussed

in this paper is shown in ﬁgure Fig. 8. Notice that for Starobinsky and Chaotic model φ

decreases during inﬂation while in the case of Hilltop inﬂation with p = 3, 4 the ﬁeld φ

increases during the evolution.

As a representative for this class let us consider the case of Quadratic Chaotic Inﬂation:

V (φ) =

µ2φ2.

(72)

Comparing Eq. (43) with Eq. (21) we can easily ﬁnd that for this model we have βp = 1/2.
The slow-roll parameters are then given by:

V =

1
2N

(73)
The Planck constraint of Eq. (50) can be used to impose N∗ (cid:39) 60. We can then use Eq. (21)
to express the COBE normalization of Eq. (48) as µ ∼ 6.106· 10−6MP . Finally we can impose
the constraint of Eq. (54) to get α/Λ (cid:46) 39.

ηV =

1
2N

Let us consider the evolution of a model with α/Λ (cid:39) 35 and V0 = µ2/2 (cid:39) 1.418·10−11. The full
numerical results for this model is show in the plots of Figs. 8, 4, 5 and 6. The corresponding

resulting values for the CMB observables are ns = 0.965, r = 0.16 and αs = 0.000387. The
value of ξ1 can be estimate by substituting V0 into Eq. (26):

1 = 2.03 · 10−18 · exp (4πξ1) ,
ξ6

−→

ξ1 (cid:39) 3.89.

(74)

To estimate the value of ξmax we start by estimating the value of V (φ) at the end of inﬂation.
2. This directly implies V (φmax) (cid:39)

For this purpose we use |V,φ/V | (cid:39) √

2 that gives φmax ∼ √

2V0. We can then use Eq. (31) to get:

max (cid:39) 0.756 · 10−15e2πξmax,
ξ3

−→

ξmax (cid:39) 6.43.

(75)

The value of ξ2 can be estimated from Eq. (29). This requires an approximate expression for
V (φ) as a function of ξ2. For this purpose we can use Eq. (21) to get:

2 (cid:39) 2.84 · 10−10e2πξ2,
ξ7

−→

ξ2 (cid:39) 5.37,

φ2 (cid:39) 6.52.

(76)

Finally the estimated value for ξ∗ is given by Eq. (21). The estimated values for N2, and N1
and ∆N∗ are obtained by using Eq. (35), Eq. (28) and Eq. (36): N2 (cid:39) 19.33, ∆N∗ (cid:39) 8.71,
N1 (cid:39) 29.89. The corresponding frequencies are given by Eq. (19):

f1 (cid:39) 3.77 · 10−5 Hz,

f2 (cid:39) 1.46 Hz.

(77)

As it is possible to see from Fig. 6, these estimates are approximatively matching the values

for these two frequencies in the full numerical computation.

29

A.2 Hilltop inﬂation, 2 < p.

Let consider two diﬀerent examples of models of this class. We begin by considering the

potential of Eq. (47) with q = 4 and then we move to the case q = 3.

A.2.1 Hilltop inﬂation, p = 3.

Let us consider the potential:

V (φ) = V0

(cid:34)

1 −

(cid:19)4(cid:35)2

,

(cid:18) φ

v

(78)

Again we compare Eq. (43) with Eq. (21) to ﬁnd βp = v4/128. In this case the lowest order
expression for the potential slow-roll parameters then read:

V (cid:39) v4

128N 3 ,

ηV (cid:39) − 3
2N

.

(79)

The constraints on the values for ns and r then gives N∗ = 50. We proceed by imposing
ξ∗ (cid:46) 2.5 to get:

(80)

(81)

α
Λ

(cid:46) 1.4 · 104
v2 .

Finally we can use the COBE normalization to determine V0:

V0 (cid:39) 3.26 · v4 · 10−14.

Notice that similarly to the case of Sec. 4.2, we are left with some free parameters. In this

case we can choose an appropriate value for v and α/Λ to satisfy all of the conditions.

Let us consider α/Λ = 2000, v = 0.1 and V0 (cid:39) 3.6 · 10−18. This particular set of parameters
gives ns = 0.940, r = 9.93 · 10−11 and αs = 0.0039. We proceed by following the procedure
described in Sec. A.1:

ξ1 (cid:39) 5.24,

ξ2 (cid:39) 7.34,

ξmax (cid:39) 9.13.

The estimated values for N2, ∆N∗ and N1 are:

N2 (cid:39) 11.59,

∆N∗ (cid:39) 11.29,

N1 (cid:39) 12.58.

The corresponding frequencies are given by Eq. (19):

f1 (cid:39) 1.24 · 103 Hz,

f2 (cid:39) 3.34 · 103 Hz.

(82)

(83)

(84)

As it is possible to see from Fig. 6, f1 and f2 are approximatively matching the numerically
obtained values. We should stress that for this value for v, it is not possible to choose α to

saturate the CMB bound on ξ without obtaining a huge value for N2 that would be in contrast
with Planck’s constraints. As a consequence, the hilltop model does not yield a signiﬁcant

increase in ΩGW compared to the Starobinsky model.

30

A.2.2 Hilltop inﬂation, p = 4.

We conclude this section by considering the cubic Hilltop potential:

(cid:34)

V (φ) = V0

1 −

(cid:19)3(cid:35)2

(cid:18) φ

In this case we have βp = v6/72. This directly leads to:

V (cid:39) v6

72N 4 ,

ηV (cid:39) − 2
N

(85)

(86)

The constraints on the values for ns and r then gives N∗ = 60. We proceed by imposing the
small non gaussianity constraint i.e. ξ∗ (cid:46) 2.5 to get:

α
Λ

(cid:46) 1.1 · 105
v3 .

We can then impose the COBE normalization:

V0 (cid:39) 5.58 · v6 · 10−16.

As in sec A.2.1 we are then left with v and α/Λ as free parameters.

(87)

(88)

Considering the case with α/Λ = 2000, v = 0.1 and V0 (cid:39) 1.0 · 10−21. The corresponding
values for ns, r, and αs are ns = 0.918, r = 3.2 · 10−18 and αs = 0.0017. Again we proceed
by following the procedure described in Sec. A.1:
ξ2 (cid:39) 8.79,

ξmax (cid:39) 10.5.

ξ1 (cid:39) 4.58,

(89)

The estimated values for N2, ∆N∗ and N1 are:

N2 (cid:39) 9.12,

∆N∗ (cid:39) 9.11,

N1 (cid:39) 9.14.

The corresponding frequencies are given by Eq. (19):

f1 (cid:39) 3.88 · 104 Hz,

f2 (cid:39) 3.95 · 104 Hz.

(90)

(91)

Again the values of f1 and f2 are in agreement with the ones of Fig. 6. Similarly to the case
of Sec. A.2.1, it is not possible to ﬁx a value of α that gives ξ∗ (cid:39) 2.5 and again this model
does not yield a signiﬁcant increase in ΩGW compared to the Starobinsky model.
