ABSTRACT

Deep (103 ks) Chandra observations of Abell 665 have revealed rich structures in this merging
galaxy cluster, including a strong shock and two cold fronts. The newly discovered shock has a Mach
number of M = 3.0 ± 0.6, propagating in front of a cold disrupted cloud. This makes Abell 665 the
second cluster where a strong merger shock of M ≈ 3 has been detected, after the Bullet cluster. The
shock velocity from jump conditions is consistent with (2.7 ± 0.7) × 103 km sec−1. The new data also
reveal a prominent southern cold front, with potentially heated gas ahead of it. Abell 665 also hosts a
giant radio halo. There is a hint of diﬀuse radio emission extending to the shock at the north, which
needs to be examined with better radio data. This new strong shock provides a great opportunity to
study the re-acceleration model with the X-ray and radio data combined.

1. INTRODUCTION

Large-scale structures such as galaxy clusters are nat-
ural outcomes of the hierarchical mergers of smaller sub-
units. Such mergers are among the most energetic events
in the universe (e.g., Markevitch et al. 1999). A large
fraction of this energy is dissipated into the intracluster
medium (ICM) through heating the ICM gas via shocks
(e.g., Markevitch & Vikhlinin 2007; Sarazin 2008). Ob-
servationally, shocks can be seen as surface brightness
edges in X-ray observations. These edges provide mea-
surements of gas bulk velocities and can be used to
study the micro transport processes in the ICM like
thermal conduction and electron-ion equilibration (e.g,
Shafranov 1957; Takizawa 1999; Markevitch & Vikhlinin
2007). Shock detection is challenging, requiring favor-
able merger geometry. They are therefore rare and only
a handful of shocks have been detected so far. Typi-
cally shocks in merging galaxy clusters have relatively
low Mach numbers (M ≤ 3) and only two clusters have,
M ≥ 2.5 i.e., A521 (Bourdin et al. 2013) and the Bullet
cluster (Markevitch et al. 2002).

As the richest cluster classiﬁed by Abell (1958), Abell
665 (A665 from now) has been studied extensively at
many wavelengths. Geller & Beers (1982) in their opti-
cal study noticed an elongation in the galaxy distribu-
tion suggesting the unrelaxed state of the cluster. On
the other hand, G´omez et al. (2000, hereafter GHB00)

studied the dynamics of the cluster and only found weak
evidence for substructures in radial velocities of galax-
ies. The cluster hosts a giant radio halo ﬁrst observed
by Moﬀet & Birkinshaw (1989). Vacca et al. (2010) ex-
amined the radio halo emission in detail with deep VLA
observations and constrained the magnetic ﬁeld distri-
bution in the cluster. Previous X-ray observations re-
vealed complex substructures including possible detec-
tion of a shock in front of a core which appeared to corre-
late with the radio emission (e.g., Markevitch et al. 2001;
Govoni et al. 2004).

To further investigate, we obtained deep Chandra ob-
servations in 2012. In this letter, we present the detection
of a strong shock from new observations. Throughout
the letter, H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1, ΩM = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7.
At z = 0.182 (GHB00), 1′′ = 3.05 kpc. All error bars
reported show 68% conﬁdence interval.

2. DATA ANALYSIS

A665 was observed by Advanced CCD Imaging Spec-
trometer (ACIS) in the Very Faint mode for a total ex-
posure of ∼ 125 ks. All observations were taken with
the ACIS-I. Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observa-
tions v4.7 and calibration database v4.6.7 from Chandra
X-ray Center were used for data reduction. We followed
the data analysis described in Dasadia et al. (2016). The
clean exposures are: 32.7 ks for ObsID 12286, 48.5 ks for
ObsID 13201 and 22.2 ks for ObsID 3586. Point sources
were excluded from spatial and spectral analysis.

The NH value towards the cluster, 5.0 × 1020 cm−2,
was determined from the spectrum of a large region of the
cluster excluding the core. This is the same as the value
predicted from the empirical relation by Willingale et al.
(2013), while the HI column density towards the cluster
is 4.2 × 1020 cm−2 (Kalberla et al. 2005). Reducing NH
to the HI value only causes 7 - 10% changes on best-ﬁt pa-
rameters. We followed the same background method by
Sun et al. (2009). Spectra were ﬁtted with XSPEC ver-
sion 12.8 (Arnaud et al. 1996). This work used AtomDB
2.0.2. Throughout the analysis, we adopt the solar abun-
dance table by Anders & Grevesse (1989).

3. RESULTS

Figure 1A shows the exposure corrected image of the
cluster produced by combining all three observations in
the 0.7 - 2.0 keV energy band. The image reveals dis-
turbed gas with multiple discontinuities caused by the
merger. The X-ray morphology suggests a violent merger
where the two subclusters have recently passed through
each other roughly along the north-south direction (e.g.,
Markevitch et al. 2001).
In this letter, we call the one
merging from the north as the subcluster and the other
one as the primary cluster. The X-ray peak is elongated
in the north-west (NW) to south-east (SE) direction with
a bright edge in the south (C2). This X-ray brightest re-
gion, as the core of the infalling subcluster, is relatively
cool. The ram pressure generated by the motion of the
subcluster is stripping materials from the bright core.
There is a tail of emission that can be seen to the north
over a distance of ∼ 300 kpc. No surface brightness peak
associated with the primary cluster core is observed. It
is likely the primary cluster’s core has already been dis-
rupted by the merger. We notice two additional edges
(C1 & S1) in the north. The inner edge (C1) marks a
boundary between the remnant core of the primary clus-
ter and the ICM of the subcluster. There is a second,
outer surface brightness edge (S1) ∼ 600 kpc ahead of
the inner edge. We conﬁrm that this is a shock which
separates shock heated gas from the cluster outskirts. In
this letter, we mainly focus on these two northern edges.

3.1. Spatial Analysis

Figure 1B shows the surface brightness proﬁle in the
northern sector N. The proﬁle changes its slope at two
places, C1 (the cold front) and S1 (the shock front).
Regions I-III (the remnant core, the postshock region,
and the preshock region) can then be deﬁned. The gas
density distribution in regions I & II was derived by ﬁt-
ting corresponding surface brightness proﬁles to a model,
where the X-ray emissivity (ǫ) and radius (r) are related
by a powerlaw, ǫ ∝ r−p within each region assuming
an ellipsoidal geometry as discussed in Korngut et al.
(2011). The model for a region with two edges was ﬁtted.
The best-ﬁt powerlaw index (p) in region I & II are 0.60
± 0.01 and 1.1 ± 0.1 respectively. Using the powerlaw
index, we reconstructed the intrinsic emissivity distri-
bution to obtain the corresponding density distribution,
ne(r) = [ǫ(r)/Λ(Te, Z)]1/2, where Λ(Te, Z) is the X-ray
emissivity function which depends on electron tempera-
ture Te and abundance Z. The surface brightness in the
preshock region (Region III) was ﬁtted to a powerlaw
density model, ne(r) = ne0r−α. The model provides a
good ﬁt to the data and α = 2.4 ± 0.3.

Figure 1D shows the best-ﬁt density model in each re-
gion. The density jumps across the shock by a factor of
ρ2/ρ1 = 3.2 ± 0.3, where suﬃx 1 and 2 describe quantity
before and after the shock. We apply Rankine-Hugoniot
jump conditions to determine the Mach number M =
3.4 (> 2.7 at 90%) for a monoatomic gas (γ = 5/3) (e.g.,
Landau & Lifshitz 1959). The models used to ﬁt surface
brightness proﬁles approximate the shape of edges to be
elliptical. We have to make assumptions for the curva-
ture of the isodensity surfaces along the line of sight,
which introduces a systematic uncertainty. For exam-
ple, if we assume that the shock surface has a curvature

along the line of sight similar to that in the plane of the
sky (r ≈ 2 Mpc instead of the distance to the cluster
center, 1.4 Mpc, that was used for the above ﬁt), while
the preshock gas is still centered on the cluster center,
the shock density jump is reduced to factor 2.6, and the
corresponding Mach number to 2.5.

Sector S (Figure 1A) was used to investigate the south-
ern cold front (C2). Figure 1E includes the 0.7 - 2.0 keV
surface brightness proﬁle across C2. The slope change
at ∼ 170 kpc corresponds to a density jump by a factor
of ∼ 2.1. The proﬁle shows no additional discontinuity
ahead of C2.

3.2. Spectral Analysis

Sector N was divided into four smaller regions (I, IIa,
IIb, III) in the spectral analysis. The pre-shock region
(region III) also includes an extended source with un-
known nature (Ear2 in §4.1), which was excluded in the
spectral analysis. For each region, the spectra from in-
dividual observations were ﬁtted simultaneously to an
absorbed single temperature thermal emission model
APEC (e.g., Smith et al. 2001), after accounting for the
background (see Dasadia et al. 2016). The spectra were
ﬁtted in the 0.5 - 7.0 keV energy band and the best-
ﬁt parameters were obtained by minimizing C-statistics
deﬁned in XSPEC.

The best-ﬁt projected (black) and deprojected (red)
temperatures are shown in Figure 1C. A deprojection
correction was applied by estimating the projection con-
tribution of outer layers onto the inner ones. The layers
were assumed to be spherical in the shape, which is a
reasonable assumption for wedge shaped regions across
fronts. The gas temperature beyond region III, 2.5 keV,
was estimated from the azimuthally averaged tempera-
ture proﬁle of the cluster. For the deprojection analysis,
we combined regions II a & b. The best-ﬁt density model
was then multiplied by the corresponding temperature to
obtain the electron pressure distribution in Figure 1D.

Region I contains gas at a temperature of 8.2+0.8

−0.6 keV
and abundance of 0.3 ± 0.1 ZJ. Across the inner edge
(C1), the surface brightness drop is accompanied by an
increase in the temperature. Region II contains the
hottest gas in the cluster with an average temperature
of ∼ 11 keV. The best-ﬁt temperature in region IIb is
11.3+2.2
−1.8 keV. The abundance in region IIb is poorly con-
strained. Thus, we ﬁxed the abundance to 0.2 ZJ. The
best-ﬁt temperature changes by less than 5% for Z =
0.1 ZJ - 0.4 ZJ. We combine regions II a & b to ob-
tain postshock temperature of Tshock = 11.0+1.4
−0.8 keV.
The preshock temperature from region III is Tpreshock =
3.2 ± 1.1 keV. Thus, the temperature jumps across the
shock front by a factor of 3.8 ± 1.3, which corresponds to
a Mach number Mproj = 3.0 ± 0.6. The Mach number
after applying deprojection correction is Mdeproj = 3.2
± 0.7. This is consistent with the Mach number derived
from the density jump. The preshock sound speed is cs
= (9.1 ± 0.1) × 102 km sec−1, giving a shock speed of
vshock = Mprojcs = (2.7 ± 0.7) × 103 km sec−1.

The velocity of the cold disrupted cloud can also be es-
timated from the pressure ratio between just inside the
cold cloud and the free stream, assuming a uniform ﬂow
of gas around a blunt body. While this is a good ap-
proximation for simple mergers, it may not be true for

Strong Merger shock in A665

complex mergers like in A665. For example, the shock
is separated from the cold front by ∼ 600 kpc, which is
much larger than expected for a steady-state situation.
Also, in models of cluster mergers after the ﬁrst core pas-
sage, the subcluster core is slowed by gravity and drag
and falls back into the central region of the merged clus-
ter, while the shock speeds up towards the cluster out-
skirt by following a negative pressure gradient.

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. Merger Dynamics

The obvious interpretation of the data is that the clus-
ter is experiencing a two-body merger. A study on clus-
ter dynamics of A665 done by GHB00 concluded that
the velocity distribution is similar to a fairly relaxed and
massive cluster and detected “only marginal evidence for
substructure and non-Gaussianity in the velocity distri-
bution”. This may imply that the merger is occurring
nearly in the plane of sky. The N -body simulation by
GHB00 suggests that the observed velocity dispersion is
consistent with a merger between two similar sized sub-
clusters caught in the middle. The X-ray data reveal one
core while the other core may have been disrupted by the
merger.

Elongation of the X-ray peak suggests that the merger
axis is close to N - S. The infalling subcluster core is
moving south and is being stripped by ram pressure.
The surface brightness edge ahead the remnant core is
a cold front (C2) formed by the head-on merger. Previ-
ously, Owers et al. (2009, O09 hereafter) argued that the
southern edge (C2) in Abell 665 is more likely a shock.
O09 ﬁtted the spectrum for the cold front using a region
which extended beyond the cold front. In any case, the
errors on the spectral parameters in O09 allow for ei-
ther a shock or a cold front. From our new data, we ﬁnd
that the temperature increases by a factor of ∼ 1.3 (from
7.3 ± 0.4 keV to 9.3 ± 0.7 keV) across C2 which conﬁrms
it is a cold front (Figure 1F). The surface brightness dis-
tribution derived for sector S (Figure 1E) shows no slope
change outside of C2. However, the relatively high tem-
perature ahead of C2 may imply a shock heated region
there (as suggested in Markevitch et al. 2001), although
the current Chandra data do not allow a good constraint
on the temperature beyond sector S.

We derived the abundance map of the cluster, which
is nearly ﬂat at ∼ 0.2 ZJ. The core of the subcluster
shows no abundance enhancement. This is in contrast to
merging clusters with strong cool cores. For example, in
A2146, the abundance at the subcluster core (∼ 0.9 ZJ)
is much higher than elsewhere at ∼ 0.4 ZJ (Russell et al.
2012). Similarly, in RXJ0334.2 − 0111 there is a clear
abundance diﬀerence between two merger components
(Dasadia et al. 2016). On the other hand, A665’s core
is at most a weak cool core, with a central entropy of ∼
135 keV cm2 (Cavagnolo et al. 2009).

The more diﬀuse merger component can be seen in
the north with an upstream cold front (C1). C1 has
a large radius of curvature, Rcf ∼ 750 kpc. The edge
appears sharper in the east and can be traced over a
distance of ∼ 850 kpc. The distance between the stag-
nation point and the closest point on the shock (S1),
also known as “stand-oﬀ” distance ds,
is ∼ 600 kpc.
This is the largest among all merging clusters e.g., in

the case of the Bullet cluster, stand-oﬀ distance is ∼ 138
kpc (Markevitch et al. 2002) while in A754 it is approx-
imately ∼ 160 kpc (Macario et al. 2011). The shock has
an almost ﬂat shape and is visible over a distance of ∼
1.2 Mpc. This is similar to the shock length ∼ 1.1 Mpc in
the merging cluster A520 (Markevitch et al. 2005). How-
ever, in A520 the stand-oﬀ distance is only 50 kpc.

Two substructures (Ear1 & Ear2) on the north of the
cluster have been observed (Figure 1A). Ear1 is located
∼ 1.5 Mpc from the cluster center and the faint galax-
ies within it have no redshift information.
If Ear1 is
an isolated system, its redshift range can be estimated
from the L − T relation (e.g., Sun 2012). The allowed z
range is 0.5 - 0.9 with a system temperature of ∼ 4 keV.
Ear2 is located ∼ 330 kpc north of S1 and contains two
galaxies at the cluster redshift. The allowed z range of
Ear2, from the L − T relation, is 0.1 - 0.3. Thus, Ear2
is likely another subcluster associated with A665. Ear2
was excluded in our analysis for the pre-shock region.

4.2. Diﬀuse Radio Emission

A665 contains a giant radio halo (RH) which is about
1.8 Mpc in size (Giovannini & Feretti 2000). Recent
VLA observations show that the RH is elongated in
the SE-NW direction.
It appears that the radio emis-
sion is asymmetric with respect to the cluster center,
being brighter and more extended towards NW (e.g.,
Feretti et al. 2004; Vacca et al. 2010). The spectral in-
dex map of the radio halo produced by Feretti et al.
(2004) shows that the radio spectrum near the X-ray
shock is ﬂatter than that in the southern region, which
may be consistent with the recent shock acceleration ob-
served. There is some radio emission close to S1. After
removing the contribution from several point sources us-
ing multi-resolution radio data, the ﬂux associated with
the diﬀuse region near the X-ray shock is 1.9±0.2 mJy, al-
though the source subtraction is uncertain and the pres-
ence of this emission needs conﬁrmation with deeper ob-
servations.

X-ray shock fronts often exhibit a corresponding sharp
feature in the radio synchrotron emission (Markevitch
2012). It is interesting to note that the relatively strong
(M ≈ 3) shock front that we observe in A665 does
not exhibit a prominent radio relic, as do some other
shocks with similar or lower Mach numbers, such as A521
(M ≈ 2.5; Giacintucci et al. 2008; Bourdin et al. 2013),
A754 (M ≈ 1.6; Kassim et al. 2001; Macario et al. 2011),
A3667 (M ≈ 2; Finoguenov et al. 2010) and the eastern
shock in the Bullet cluster (M ≈ 2.5; Shimwell et al.
2015).
It also does not exhibit (at least with the
present radio sensitivity) an abrupt edge of the giant
halo at the shock, as observed, e.g., at the western shock
in the Bullet cluster (M ≈ 3; Markevitch et al. 2002;
Shimwell et al. 2014), A520 (M ≈ 2.3; Markevitch et al.
2005) and Coma (M ≈ 2; Brown & Rudnick 2010).

A665 appears similar to A2034 (M ≈ 1.6; Owers et al.
2014) in that they both exhibit only hints of diﬀuse
radio emission in the post-shock region. Some other
shocks clearly visible in X-rays do not show any radio
emission — e.g., the two M ≈ 1.6 − 2 fronts in A2146
(Russell et al. 2012). Radio relics are believed to be pro-
duced by diﬀusive acceleration of ultrarelativistic elec-
trons on shock fronts (most likely starting with aged rel-
ativistic electron population rather than thermal elec-

4

DASADIA ET AL.

trons, e.g., Macario et al. 2011; Brunetti & Jones 2011).
But the above examples show that it occurs on some
shocks but not others, apparently unrelated to the Mach
number. This may be explained by diﬀerent density
of seed electrons available for re-acceleration at the
shock locations — relics occur only when a shock front
crosses a cloud with an excess of such electrons, as sug-
gested in Shimwell et al. (2015).
In other locations,
shocks either do not produce detectable radio emission,
or produce only a faint edge of a giant halo, within
which the merger turbulence takes over and provides re-
acceleration needed to sustain the halo.

5. SUMMARY

Deep Chandra observations of A665 have revealed com-
plex substructures,
including the detection of a new
strong shock with a Mach number of 3.0 ± 0.6 and at
least two cold fronts. The shock propagates in front of
the cooler gas, apparently a remnant of a dense core
which may have been disrupted by the merger. The
shock front can be traced to ∼ 1.2 Mpc in length and
has a velocity of 2.7 ± 0.7 × 103 km sec−1. The system
exhibits a unique merger geometry, e.g., the distance be-

tween the shock and the stagnation point of a cold front,
∼ 600 kpc, is largest among all merger shocks. This
provides an excellent opportunity to study shock heat-
ing mechanism, although this will require deeper X-ray
data. We also rule out the prominent southern edge as a
shock, as suggested previously; it is in fact a cold front.
The cluster hosts a giant (∼ 1.8 Mpc in size) radio halo
which appears to extend south of cold front (C2). There
is a radio extension towards the northern shock. How-
ever, given the contamination of discrete sources located
near the shock location, the spatial correlation between
the X-ray shock and the diﬀuse radio emission must be
taken with caution. Mass distribution in A665, con-
strained from lensing, would be important to understand
the dynamics in A665. The early result by Dahle et al.
(2002) suggested an oﬀset of the X-ray peak from the
galaxy distribution, which needs to be better studied.

Fig. 1.— A: The background subtracted, exposure corrected Chandra image of A665 in the 0.7 - 2.0 keV energy band, smoothed by
a Gaussian with σ = 5.9′′. Point sources are removed. The arrows show the southern cold front (C2), the northern cold front (C1) and
the shock front (S1). Two diﬀuse sources are marked by Ear1 and Ear2. Sectors N and S used to study surface brightness edges are also
shown. The V LA 1.4 GHz contours (blue) from Vacca et al. (2010) are also overlaid (contour levels from 135 µJy/beam to 17 mJy/beam,
spaced by a factor of 2). B: The 0.7-2.0 keV surface brightness proﬁle in sector N. Three distinct regions are marked:
inside cold front
(Region I), post shock (Region II) and pre shock (Region III). The two vertical dashed lines show the location of the cold front (left) and
the shock front (right). The red dashed line shows the surface brightness proﬁle from the best-ﬁt density model. C: The projected (black)
and deprojected (red) temperature values in regions (I, IIa, IIb, & III) across northern edges C1 & S1. D: The corresponding model density
(red) and pressure (black) proﬁles. Error bars on pressure show 1σ conﬁdence interval. E: The 0.7-2.0 keV surface brightness proﬁle in
sector S. The location of C1 is marked by a vertical dashed line. The proﬁle show no discontinuity ahead of C1. F: Projected temperature
proﬁle across C1 that suggests C1 as a cold front.
