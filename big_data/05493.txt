We study mid-infrared strong-ﬁeld ionization of rare-gas clusters (103 to 105 atoms) in the im-
pulsive limit using 12 fs laser pulses. The emission of fast electrons with kinetic energies exceeding
3 keV is observed at 1.8 µm and an intensity of 1×1015 W/cm2, whereas only electrons below 500 eV
are observed at 800 nm using a similar intensity and pulse duration. Fast electrons are preferentially
emitted along the laser polarization direction, indicating that they are driven out from the cluster
by the laser ﬁeld via direct and rescattering processes within a few femtoseconds. In contrast to
previous near-infrared strong-ﬁeld ionization experiments in clusters using 200-1000 fs laser pulses,
the yield of fast electrons decreases with increasing pulse duration. Scaling to longer wavelengths is
expected to result in a highly directional current of hot electrons on a few-femtosecond timescale.

In the past few years, ultrashort mid-infrared (MIR)
(≈ 1.5 − 10 µm) laser pulses have become an important
tool for the investigation of strong-ﬁeld physics in atoms,
molecules and solids [1–8]. The use of laser pulses in
the MIR spectral range is often motivated by the large
ponderomotive energies that electrons can acquire, which
scale as the square of the wavelength. As a consequence,
electrons can be eﬃciently accelerated up to high kinetic
energies, which has been exploited for the production
of high-harmonic generation (HHG) pulses in the keV
range [3] and for the development of bright hard x-ray
sources [4]. Furthermore, the use of strong MIR laser
ﬁelds has led to an advancement of HHG schemes in
solids [5–7] and to the development of time-resolved pho-
toelectron holography [8].

Sub-wavelength nanoscale particles represent a dis-
tinct class of targets, and were found to exhibit a fun-
damentally diﬀerent behavior in comparison to atoms,
molecules and solids, when exposed to strong laser ﬁelds.
While the particles themselves have a near-solid density,
the distances between the particles are large, meaning
that energy cannot be dissipated into the environment,
as is the case for solids. The ionization of nanoscale clus-
ters by intense laser pulses has been extensively stud-
ied in diﬀerent wavelength regimes during the past two
decades. Up to now, the largest number of experiments
has been performed with ultraviolet, visible and near-
infrared (NIR) laser pulses [9–21]. Particularly intrigu-
ing results in this wavelength range were the emission of
bright x-ray radiation [9, 10], highly charged ions [11],
fast ions [13] and neutrals [18] with MeV kinetic ener-
gies, as well as the observation of correlated electronic
decay [20]. The eﬃcient absorption of NIR laser energy in
clusters creates extreme conditions, which even resulted
in the observation of nuclear fusion [14]. With the advent
of free-electron laser and high-ﬂux HHG sources, intense

laser-cluster experiments have been extended to shorter
wavelengths in the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) [22–29]
and x-ray regimes [30–32]. These novel light sources have
paved the way towards single-shot coherent diﬀractive
imaging experiments of isolated clusters [26, 30, 32] and
He nanodroplets [33], which in the latter case allowed
a retrieval of the droplet shapes and the observation of
quantum vortices.

Ionization of clusters by intense MIR laser pulses al-
lows one to exploit both the high ponderomotive ener-
gies that electrons can acquire in the laser ﬁeld and the
eﬃcient absorption of laser energy by nanoscale parti-
cles. This provides a large potential as a source of high-
energy electron, ion and photon emission. Up to now,
MIR strong-ﬁeld ionization dynamics of clusters has been
largely unexplored, in contrast to the wavelength regimes
from the NIR to the x-ray range. In Ref. [34], XUV ﬂu-
orescence from molecular clusters was studied following
ionization by 1.45 µm pulses. The emission of ﬂuores-
cence light is a signature of Rydberg atom and ion for-
mation by electron-ion recombination processes during
cluster expansion, which radiatively decay on a nanosec-
ond timescale [10, 29, 35]. In contrast, the investigation
of fast electrons emitted from clusters interacting with
intense NIR laser ﬁelds provided insight into the dynam-
ics taking place on a timescale of 50 to 1000 fs [12, 36, 37].
Electrons were found to be preferentially emitted paral-
lel to the laser polarization within a cone angle between
40◦ [37] and 60◦ (full width at half maximum) [12]. This
was a clear indication that fast electrons are driven out
from the cluster by the laser ﬁeld during the laser pulse
duration. By using even shorter pulse durations in the
impulsive limit, one can eliminate the eﬀects of ion dy-
namics and isolate the electron dynamics taking place
early during the ﬁrst few cycles of the laser pulse. Re-
cent studies in the impulsive regime in the NIR range led
to surprising observations: the ion emission from clusters
exhibited an anomalous behavior and was peaked in the
direction perpendicular to the laser polarization, whereas
the electrons were preferentially emitted in the direction

of the laser polarization [16].

In this communication, we report on the ﬁrst MIR
strong-ﬁeld ionization experiment in clusters using 2-
cycle laser pulses, meaning that ion motion is eﬀectively
frozen. We demonstrate highly eﬃcient electron acceler-
ation from clusters, resulting in the observation of keV
electrons at much lower MIR laser intensities than in pre-
vious NIR experiments [12, 36, 37]. A narrow angular
electron distribution peaked along the laser polarization
direction demonstrates that electrons are emitted within
a few femtoseconds during the intense laser-cluster in-
teractions. For longer MIR pulses, a decreasing yield
of fast electrons is found. Our results are expected to
be relevant for other nanoscale systems, including large
(bio-)molecules that interact with intense few-cycle MIR
pulses.

For the generation of MIR pulses,

laser pulses at
800 nm with an energy of 8 mJ and a duration of 30 fs
were derived from a Ti:sapphire ampliﬁer system (1 kHz
repetition rate), and coupled into an optical parametric
ampliﬁer. The output idler pulses at 1.8 µm were spec-
trally broadened by focusing them into a diﬀerentially
pumped hollow-core ﬁber ﬁlled with Ar [38]. Tempo-
ral compression of the spectrally broadened pulses was
achieved by using a combination of a 1 mm BK7 window
and an achromatic λ/2 waveplate (wavelength range be-
tween 700 and 2500 nm) consisting of a 1.5 mm fused
silica plate and a 1.2 mm MgF2 plate. The pulse dura-
tion was measured before and after each experimental run
making use of spatially-encoded arrangement ﬁlter-based
spectral phase interferometry for direct electric ﬁeld re-
construction (SEA-F-SPIDER) [39, 40]. The laser path
from the output of the ﬁber to the experimental cham-
ber through air and through the vacuum window slightly
stretched the pulse, resulting in a typical pulse duration
of 12 fs. After transmission and reﬂection losses, a typical
pulse energy of 0.45 mJ was applied in the experiment.
We used a second hollow-core ﬁber ﬁlled with Ar in or-
der to spectrally broaden NIR pulses. Temporal compres-
sion of these pulses was achieved by using chirped mirrors
and additional dispersion acquired by passing through
an achromatic waveplate (wavelength range from 650 to
900 nm). These pulses were temporally characterized by
applying frequency-resolved optical gating, giving a pulse
duration of 13 fs.

The compressed MIR (or NIR) pulses were coupled
into a vacuum chamber through a 1 mm thick CaF2 win-
dow, and focused into the interaction zone by a spherical
silver mirror with a focal length of 15 cm at near-normal
incidence.
In the interaction zone, the laser beam and
a cluster beam intersected at right angles. The cluster
beam was generated by a piezoelectric valve with a noz-
zle diameter of 1 mm that operated at room tempera-
ture at a repetition rate of 5 Hz. The average cluster size
was controlled by varying the backing pressure between
1 and 7 bar, and estimated according to the Hagena scal-
ing law [41]. Under these conditions clustering is known
to be highly eﬃcient and to lead to clusters in the size

2

range from 103 to 105 atoms. The piezoelectric valve was
mounted at a distance of 10 cm from a molecular beam
skimmer with an oriﬁce diameter of 0.5 mm, which was
used to select the central part of the cluster beam and to
maintain a low pressure in the experimental chamber.

Electron spectra from clusters were measured using
a time-of-ﬂight (TOF) spectrometer with an acceptance
angle < 3◦ [42]. A double-stack microchannel plate was
employed for electron detection, and the anode signal was
read out by an oscilloscope. A retarding voltage could be
applied to the ﬂight tube such that only electrons with ki-
netic energy above the retarding potential were detected.
Kinetic energy spectra were obtained by measuring the
electron yields at diﬀerent retarding voltages and diﬀer-
entiating the results, similarly to previous studies of fast
electrons emitted from clusters [12, 36, 37]. An achro-
matic λ/2 waveplate was used to rotate the linear laser
polarization axis with respect to the TOF axis.

In Fig. 1(a) TOF traces are shown that were recorded
from Xe clusters (hN i = 1 × 105 atoms) ionized by
1.8 µm pulses with a duration of 12 fs and an inten-
sity of 1 × 1015 W/cm2.
In accordance with previous
strong-ﬁeld ionization experiments on clusters in the NIR
regime [12, 36, 37], two peaks are observed, which ex-
hibit a completely diﬀerent behavior, when the retarding
voltage is varied. While the height of the ﬁrst peak at
1.5 ns is only inﬂuenced by ﬂuctuations of the experi-
mental parameters, the height of the second peak clearly
decreases for increasing retarding voltages. We attribute
the ﬁrst peak to the emission of photons in the ultra-
violet and XUV range, in accordance with the experi-
ments performed in Refs. [36, 37]. As mentioned earlier,
these photons are emitted as a consequence of Rydberg
atom and ion formation in the expanding cluster and
their subsequent decay via ﬂuorescence on a nanosecond
timescale [10]. On this long time scale, any information
about the laser polarization direction is lost, since dur-
ing the cluster expansion many collisions between elec-
trons, atoms and ions have taken place. Therefore, the
photon emission is isotropic, and the height of this peak
does not change for diﬀerent laser polarizations. The
second peak is attributed to electron emission, in agree-
ment with [12, 36, 37]. At a retarding voltage of 3 kV
(green curve), a fraction of the electron signal remains
visible at 12 ns, showing that electrons with energies in
excess of 3 keV are emitted from Xe clusters. This is only
slightly lower than the maximum electron kinetic energies
of 5 keV [36] and 6 keV [37] measured in the NIR regime
at intensities of 8 × 1015 W/cm2 and 5 × 1016 W/cm2.
We attribute the eﬃcient acceleration of electrons in the
MIR regime as observed in Fig. 1(a) to the higher pon-
deromotive potential of the laser ﬁeld, which partially
compensates for the lower laser intensity used in our ex-
periment.

Angular electron emission distributions from clusters
are shown in Fig. 1(b), which in contrast to photons are
peaked along the laser polarization direction. For Xe
clusters, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of

FIG. 1. (a) TOF traces measured from Xe clusters (hN i = 1 × 105 atoms) ionized by 1.8 µm laser pulses with a duration of
12 fs (I = 1 × 1015 W/cm2). The black trace was recorded perpendicular to the laser polarization at a retarding voltage of
3000 V, whereas the other traces were measured parallel to the laser polarization at diﬀerent retarding voltages as indicated.
The peak around 1.5 ns is attributed to the emission of photons and exhibits an isotropic behavior, while the peak between
10 and 20 ns is due to electron emission. The oscillations visible after the photon peak are artifacts due to electronic ringing,
which does not aﬀect the results. (b) Normalized angular distributions of electrons emitted from Xe clusters at a retarding
voltage of 1000 V (black curve), and from Kr clusters (hN i = 23000 atoms) at a retarding voltage of 500 V (red curve). Note
that the diﬀerent retarding voltages only have a small inﬂuence on the angular electron emission distribution. For comparison,
the angular electron emission distribution from Kr clusters interacting with 13 fs pulses at 800 nm (I = 0.7 × 1015 W/cm2) is
shown at a retarding voltage of 100 V (blue curve). This lower voltage was chosen, because the ponderomotive potential of the
800 nm ﬁeld is signiﬁcantly smaller, and hence electrons with much lower kinetic energies are observed (cf. Fig. 2). (c) Angular
electron emission distribution from Kr clusters over an angular range of 360◦.

the angular distribution is 40◦ (black curve in Fig. 1(b)),
while it is only about 30◦ for Kr clusters (red curve in
Fig. 1(b)). This diﬀerence could be explained by the
larger average cluster size for Xe, which increases the
probability of collisions between the escaping electrons
and other particles, thus altering the emission direction.
In comparison, the angular emission distribution of Kr
clusters ionized by few-cycle 800 nm pulses is about 55◦
(blue curve in Fig. 1(b)). The narrower angular width of
the electron emission distribution at 1.8 µm compared to
800 nm is attributed to the larger ponderomotive energy
and the more eﬃcient acceleration of electrons along the
laser polarization direction. Fig. 1(c) visualizes the large
contrast in the electron emission in the directions parallel
and perpendicular to the laser polarization. In a strong-
ﬁeld ionization experiment with Ne, which does not form
clusters at room temperature, we recorded a FWHM of
only 12◦. This is consistent with earlier measurements
on atomic systems, in which a FWHM of about 10◦ was
reported for Ar [43] and Xe [44] at a wavelength of 2 µm.
In Fig. 2(a), electron kinetic energy spectra for clusters
consisting of diﬀerent atomic species and with diﬀerent
cluster sizes are displayed. These spectra were obtained
by integrating the yields of the second peak as shown
in Fig. 1(a) and diﬀerentiating the results measured at
diﬀerent retarding voltages. While the electron yields ob-
tained from Xe, Kr and Ar clusters are similar for kinetic
energies up to 400 eV, they strongly diﬀer at higher ki-
netic energies. The fastest electrons are observed from
Xe clusters, followed by Kr and Ar clusters. We note
that a reliable measurement of very slow electrons with
kinetic energies < 5 eV is not possible with our TOF
spectrometer. For comparison, we have recorded elec-

tron kinetic energy spectra at 800 nm using a pulse du-
ration of 13 fs and an intensity of 0.7 × 1015 W/cm2, see
Fig. 2(b). Although this intensity is only slightly lower
than the intensity of 1 × 1015 W/cm2 applied at 1.8 µm,
electrons with much lower maximum kinetic energies are
observed, in agreement with a recent study at 800 nm
using 7 fs pulses [45]. These results demonstrate a highly
eﬃcient acceleration of electrons from clusters in strong
MIR ﬁelds.

The observations can be explained by rescattering
models, in which electrons gain energy by a laser-driven
interaction with individual ions [1, 46] or with the cluster
potential [47–49]. Numerical results in Ref. [47] showed
that electrons are eﬃciently accelerated by traversing
the enhanced polarization ﬁeld present within the clus-
ter.
In addition to rescattered electrons, the emission
of direct electrons is expected at lower kinetic energies
(cf. [47–49]). Our results obtained in clusters are quali-
tatively similar to electron spectra measured from atoms
in the MIR regime [1]. This can be explained by the
short MIR pulse duration used in our experiment, during
which clusters are expected to reach a much lower ioniza-
tion degree compared to cluster experiments with longer
laser pulses [11]. As a consequence, the inﬂuence of the
charged cluster environment on the emission of electrons
is expected to be less pronounced. In agreement with re-
sults obtained in atoms [1], a plateau at higher kinetic en-
ergies is clearly visible in Fig. 2 for 1.8 µm pulses, while it
is much less pronounced for 800 nm pulses. This plateau
is a signature of the rescattering region [1]. We note that
the electron spectra presented in Fig. 2(a) are aﬀected
by focal volume averaging over diﬀerent MIR laser inten-
sities and by the cluster size distribution present in the

FIG. 2.

ionization of Xe, Kr and Ar clusters (with diﬀerent aver-
age sizes as indicated) by 1.8 µm pulses at an intensity of
1 × 1015 W/cm2 and a pulse duration of 12 fs. The spectra
are shown in a logarithmic scale. (b) For comparison, elec-
tron kinetic energy spectra after ionization of Xe, Kr and Ar

experiment.

We have further investigated the role of the average
cluster size for the emission of fast electrons. In Fig. 3(a),
electron yields from Kr clusters are presented as a func-
tion of the backing pressure applied to the piezoelectric
valve for diﬀerent retarding voltages. As the cluster size
increases from hN i = 240 to hN i = 23000 atoms, the
yields of fast electrons increase, before exhibiting some
saturation at about 6 bar.
In Fig. 3(b), TOF traces
are shown that were measured at a retarding voltage of
1000 V. When the average Kr cluster size is decreased
from hN i = 23000 to hN i = 4500 atoms, both the pho-
ton yield and the electron yield are reduced. This can
partially be explained by the reduced target density in
the experiment due to the decreased backing pressure.

FIG. 3. (a) Yields of fast electrons from Kr clusters obtained
for diﬀerent backing pressures at retarding voltages of 500 V,
1000 V and 1500 V. (b) TOF traces from Kr clusters with an
average size of hN i = 4500 atoms and hN i = 23000 atoms
measured at a retarding voltage of 1000 V. (c) Correspond-
ing yields of electrons recorded at diﬀerent retarding voltages
shown in a logarithmic vertical scale. The inset shows a zoom
of the high-energy electrons in a linear scale, which empha-
sizes the pronounced diﬀerences in yields for the 2 cluster
sizes.

We ﬁnd that the total electron yield is higher by 25 % for
hN i = 23000 atoms with respect to hN i = 4500 atoms.
This can, however, not explain the large diﬀerences in
the yields observed for very fast electrons that are ob-
served in Fig. 3(c). Note that in comparison to the dif-
ferentiated data shown in Fig. 2(a), the distribution of
total yields at diﬀerent retarding voltages as presented
in Fig. 3(c) is less noisy, but does not represent a kinetic
energy spectrum. At a retarding voltage of 1.5 keV, the
electron yield from larger clusters (black squares) is in-
creased by almost a factor 4 in comparison to small clus-
ters (red circles). This clearly indicates a cluster eﬀect,
since one would expect that the shape of the electron
kinetic energy spectrum remains unchanged, if only the
atomic density was varied. The quantitative diﬀerences
in the cluster-size dependent spectra may be explained
by diﬀerent widths of the scattering potential that are
expected for clusters with diﬀerent sizes [48].

The electron emission from clusters using 12 fs and
42 fs pulses is compared in Fig. 4.
It is evident that
higher electron yields and faster electrons are observed
for shorter pulses. The pulse energy was kept constant
to within 5 % in the diﬀerent measurements, leading to

a reduced intensity for the 42 fs pulses. We can there-
fore expect that rescattering results in the emission of
electrons with lower kinetic energies, in agreement with
the experimental observations. However, this behavior
is diﬀerent from the behavior observed in previous elec-
tron yield measurements from clusters using long NIR
pulses between 200 fs and 1000 fs [36]. In these studies,
the electron yield increased for increasing pulse durations
(corresponding to decreasing intensities), which was ex-
plained by resonant absorption of laser energy during the

5

expansion of the cluster. In contrast, our results demon-
strate that electrons are more eﬃciently accelerated at
higher MIR laser intensities.

In summary, we have observed highly eﬃcient acceler-
ation of electrons from clusters in strong MIR laser ﬁelds.
Electrons with kinetic energies exceeding 3 keV were ob-
served in an anisotropic distribution peaked along the
laser polarization direction. We attributed the eﬃcient
electron acceleration to direct and rescattering processes
taking place on a few-femtosecond timescale, i.e. be-
fore any signiﬁcant cluster expansion sets in.
In con-
trast to NIR experiments with 200 to 1000 fs pulses,
where the electron yield increased for increasing pulse
durations, the electron yield is highest for the shortest
pulse duration in our experiment performed in the im-
pulsive regime. Scaling the ionization wavelength to the
multi-terahertz regime [5, 6] is expected to result in a
highly directional current of hot electrons within a few
femtoseconds.
