CLASSIFICATION OF JOINT NUMERICAL RANGES OF THREE

HERMITIAN MATRICES OF SIZE THREE

KONRAD SZYMAŃSKI, STEPHAN WEIS, AND KAROL ŻYCZKOWSKI

Abstract. The joint numerical range of three hermitian matrices of order three
is a convex and compact subset W ⊂ R3 which is an image of the unit sphere
S5 ⊂ C3 under the hermitian form deﬁned by the three matrices. We label classes
of the analyzed set W by pairs of numbers counting the exposed faces of dimension
one and two. Generically, W belongs to the class of ovals. Assuming dim(W ) = 3,
the faces of dimension two are ellipses and only ten classes exist. We identify an
object in each class and use random matrices and dual varieties for illustrations.

1. Introduction

d )n, n ∈ N, is

We denote the space of complex d-by-d matrices by Md, d ∈ N, N = {1, 2, 3, . . .},
d := {a ∈ Md | a∗ = a} for the real subspace of hermitian matrices and
we write M h
1d for the identity matrix. We write (cid:104)x, y(cid:105) := x1y1 + ··· + xdyd, x, y ∈ Cd for the
inner product on Cd and SCd := {x ∈ Cd | (cid:104)x, x(cid:105) = 1} for the unit sphere. The
joint numerical range of a sequence F := (F1, . . . , Fn) ∈ (M h
W (F ) := {(cid:104)x, F x(cid:105) | x ∈ SCd} ⊂ Rn
i=1. For n = 2, identifying R2 ∼= C, the set W (F1, F2) is
where (cid:104)x, F x(cid:105) := (cid:104)x, Fix(cid:105)n
known as the numerical range {(cid:104)x, Ax(cid:105) | x ∈ SCd} of the matrix A := F1 + i F2.
Surprisingly, W (F1, F2) is convex, a fact which is known as the Toeplitz-Hausdorﬀ
theorem [50, 23]. Similarly, the joint numerical range W (F1, F2, F3) is convex [2] for
all d ≥ 3. However, n = 2, 3 are the exception with respect to convexity of W (F )
which is in general not convex for n ≥ 4, see [39, 36, 21] for further studies.
The joint numerical range W (F ) is interesting in quantum mechanics, as we recall
in Section 2, since for arbitrary d, n ∈ N the convex hull of W (F ) is the image of a
linear map Md → L(F ) on the state space of the algebra Md, that is on the set Md
of positive semi-deﬁnite matrices of trace one, L(F ) = conv W (F ). So, in the case
d = n = 3 we have

L(F ) = W (F ).

We call L(F ) convex support [51] by its name in statistics [4]. For triples F of
hermitian 3-by-3 matrices, one of us ran Wolfram Mathematica to compute the
joint numerical range from random matrices [55], and printed them on a 3D-printer.
The printout shown in Figure 1f) was the starting point for this research.

The ﬁrst item of (1.1) is motivated by unitary invariance of W (F ), the second by
equivariance under invertible aﬃne transformations of Rn.

The elliptical range theorem [35] states that if d = n = 2 then W (F ) is a singleton,
segment, or ﬁlled ellipse. For arbitrary d and n = 2 we are aware of two classiﬁcations
of W (F ). First, let d, n be arbitrary. We say that F is unitarily reducible if there
exists a unitary U ∈ Md such that the matrices U∗F U have a common block diagonal
form with at least two proper blocks. Otherwise F is unitarily irreducible. Returning
to n = 2, one classiﬁcation of W (F ) is derived [29] from a plane algebraic curve
whose convex hull is W (F ): For d = 3 the numerical range is a singleton, segment,
triangle, ellipse, or the convex hull of an ellipse and a point outside the ellipse, if
F is unitarily reducible; it is an ellipse, the convex hull of a quartic curve (with a
ﬂat portion on the boundary), or the convex hull of a sextic curve (an oval), if F is
unitarily irreducible. The sets of matrices where W (F ) has any of these shapes are
characterized in terms of eigenvalues and matrix entries [30, 44, 42], their closures

by further spectral data [49]. Another classiﬁcation, for n = 2 is based on a convex
duality of W (F ) to a so-called rigidly convex set [24, 25].
Despite an increasing interest in operator theory [7, 31, 12, 13, 11], a classiﬁcation
of L(F ) is unknown for n ≥ 3 even in the simplest case of 3-by-3 matrices. The
main technical focus of the present work is the notion of exposed face of L(F ), which
can be the empty set or the set of maximizers of any linear functional on L(F ).
Intuitively, we think of a non-empty exposed face as a ’ﬂat boundary portion’, if
it is neither equal to L(F ), nor to a singleton. For d = 3, Lemma 4.2 shows that
these exposed faces are necessarily segments, ﬁlled ellipses, or ﬁlled ellipsoids. We
call them large faces of L(F ) and collect them in the set (d = 3, n ∈ N)
L(F ) := {G | G (cid:54)= L(F ) is an exposed face of L(F ) which is
(1.2)
a segment, a ﬁlled ellipse, or a ﬁlled ellipsoid}.

SF := {(u0 : ··· : un) ∈ PCn+1 | det(u01 + u1F1 + ··· + unFn) = 0}

An analysis [12] of singularities of the projective algebraic set
(1.3)
shows that the number of ellipses in L(F ) is at most four, if d = n = 3. This is also
a corollary of our classiﬁcation. In Section 6 we shall see examples of a certain dual
variety of SF which contains (unbounded) lines. The ﬁrst such example was found
in [13] and proves that the result of [29] (the numerical range is the convex hull of
a plane algebraic curve) cannot be generalized directly to higher dimensions.
We prove in Theorem 4.3 that L(F ) is generically an oval for d ≥ 2, n ≤ 3, that is
L(F ) is a smooth, compact, and convex set with an interior point. This follows from
the von Neumann-Wigner non-crossing rule [38, 21] and from a study of normal cones
in Section 3. We prove that L(F ) is an oval, if L(F ) = ∅ and dim(L(F )) = n (the
converse is immediate). On the other hand, the crossing rule [19] and Lemma 4.4
about pre-images of M3 → L(F ) show in Remark 4.5 that ovals are the exception
for d = 3, n ≥ 4. For real symmetric matrices F , ovals are generic for d ≥ 2,
n ≤ 2 and exceptional for d = 3 already when n ≥ 3. Section 4 also collects other
methods to study exposed faces, such as spectral representation, discriminants, sum
of squares decompositions [32, 27], and corner points, that is points which lie on n
supporting hyperplanes with linearly independent normal vectors.

We now derive the classiﬁcation of the joint numerical range for d = n = 3, using
the results of Section 5. Let s denote the number of segments and e of ellipses in
L(F ). By projecting L(F ) onto planes, the classiﬁcation of the numerical range of

4

Classiﬁcation of joint numerical ranges

a 3-by-3 matrix shows that large faces intersect mutually (Lemma 5.1). Further,
we assume that L(F ) has no corner point. Then, no point lies on three mutually
distinct large faces (Lemma 5.2) so Theorem 5.3 shows that the union of large faces
contains an embedded complete graph with one vertex on each large face. Now, a
theorem about graph embedding [43] shows s + e ≤ 4. Lemma 5.4 shows s = 0, 1
(namely L(F ) has a corner point, if s ≥ 2). Observing that s = 1 implies that the
vertex degree is at most two, we arrive at the eight classes of Table 1.

For two-dimensional L(F ) we have e = 0. By projecting to a plane, L(F ) corre-
sponds to the numerical range of a 3-by-3 matrix whose classiﬁcation is cited above
[29]. Notice that L(F ) belongs to one of four classes of 2D objects characterized by
the number of segments s = 0, 1, 2, 3. For s = 0 the numerical range is the convex
hull of an ellipse or of a sextic curve. For s = 1 it is the convex hull of a quartic
curve, for s = 2 the convex hull of an ellipse and a point outside the ellipse, and
for s = 3 a triangle. We see, in the restriction to planar sets, our classiﬁcation is
coarser than that of [29].
There are ten classes of three-dimensional L(F ). All objects with corner points
belong to class (∞, 0) or (∞, 1) by Lemma 4.7. Examples are depicted in Figure 1h)
and 1i), respectively. All other objects belong to one of the eight classes of Table 1,
as we have seen in the penultimate paragraph. In Section 6 we discuss an example
of each class, except for the class (0, 0) of ovals which were studied in Section 4 of
[31]. An example of (1, 1) was published in [13], one of (1, 2) in [9], and one of (0, 4)
in [26]. We are unaware of examples in the literature for
or

(0, 3),

The classes of (1, e), e = 0, 1, 2, where L(F ) contains a segment, answer a question
of Remark 5.9 of [53] (already answered in Example 4.2 of [45]). Namely, a limit of
extreme points of Md, d ∈ N, is again an extreme point. The question whether the
analogue property holds for projections of Md is answered negative by any object
of class (1, e). In fact, any point in the relative interior of the segment of L(F ) is a
limit point of extreme points but not an extreme point itself.

Finally, we mention that the graph embedding method fails for n > 3 because
any graph can be embedded into the three-sphere S3. Still, for d = 3 all large faces
of L(F ) intersect pairwise.

2. Quantum states

Our interest in the joint numerical range is its role in quantum mechanics where
the hermitian matrices M h
d are called Hamiltonians, energies, or observables, see e.g.
[6], Secs 5.1 and 5.2, and they correspond to measurable physical quantities having
d energy levels.

Usually a (complex) C*-subalgebra A of Md is considered as the algebra of observ-
ables [1]. If a ∈ Md is positive semi-deﬁnite then we write a (cid:23) 0. The physical state
of a quantum system is given by a linear functional f : A → C which is normalized
(f (1) = 1) and positive, that is f (a) ≥ 0 for a (cid:23) 0, a ∈ A, called a state on A in
the mathematical terminology. Using the inner product (cid:104)a, b(cid:105) := tr(a∗b), a, b ∈ Md,
there exists a unique density matrix ρ ∈ A such that f (a) = tr(ρa), a ∈ A, where
ρ (cid:23) 0 has unit trace tr(ρ) = 1, see e.g. [1], Sec. 4. We use the notions of state and
density matrix synonymously and we denote the state space of A by

M(A) := {ρ ∈ A | ρ (cid:23) 0, tr(ρ) = 1}.

It is well-known that M(A) is a compact convex subset of M h
d , see for example
Theorem 4.6 of [1]. We are mainly interested in Md := M(Md) but in Sec. 4 also in
the compressed algebra pMdp where p ∈ Md is an orthogonal projection operator,
that is p2 = p∗ = p. The state space M(pMdp) is, as we recall in Sec. 4, an exposed
face of Md, see [1, 51]. The state space M2 is a Euclidean ball, called Bloch ball,
but Md is not a ball [6] for d ≥ 3. Although several attempts were made to analyze
properties of this set [28, 5, 47, 33], its complicated structure requires further studies.
In physics, the expected value of a Hamiltonian a ∈ Md, if a quantum system
is in the state ρ ∈ Md, is the real number (cid:104)ρ, a(cid:105). Thus the standard numerical
range W (F1, F2) of a non-hermitian operator A = F1 + iF2 can be considered as the
set of all possible outcomes of measurements of two hermitian operators F1 and F2
performed on two copies of the same quantum state ρ. Furthermore, this set can be
identiﬁed [16, 40] as a projection of the set Md of quantum states onto a two-plane.
In this work we analyze numerical range of a triple of hermitian matrices of order
three. As in the case of a pair of matrices, they can be interpreted as sets of
possible results of measurements of three hermitian observables performed on three
copies of the same quantum state. On the other hand they form projections of the
8D set of density matrices of order three into R3, see [22]. A special case of the
latter are projections to subsystems, whose geometry was recently studied [54, 10]
to investigate the structure of reduced density matrices for complex many-body
quantum systems.
Consider a general case, d, n ∈ N, of joint numerical range of n hermitian matrices

of arbitrary size d. In this paper we will use the following linear map
(2.1)
The set of expected values of F = (F1, . . . , Fn) is

a (cid:55)→ ((cid:104)a, F1(cid:105), . . . ,(cid:104)a, Fn(cid:105)).

d → Rn,

E : M h

L(F ) := E(Md) = {E(ρ) | ρ ∈ Md}.

We call the set L(F ) convex support [51] following statistics language usage [4]. It
is a compact convex subset of Rn. The convex support equals the convex hull of the
joint numerical range
(2.2)
Recall that for n = 3 and d ≥ 3 we have L(F ) = W (F ) because W (F ) is convex.

L(F ) = conv(W (F )).

A proof of equation (2.2) is given in [22] using linear algebra. Because of its
importance we give a second, convex geometric, proof. A face of a convex subset
C ⊂ Rm is a convex subset of C which contains the endpoints of every open segment
in C which it intersects. The faces ∅, C are improper faces of C, all other faces are
proper faces. An exposed face of C is deﬁned as the set of maximizers in C of some

Classiﬁcation of joint numerical ranges

linear functional; ∅ is an exposed face by deﬁnition. It is easy to prove that every
exposed face is a face. If a singleton is a face or exposed face then we call its element
an extreme point or exposed point, respectively.
Minkowski’s theorem aﬃrms that every compact convex subset of Rm, m ∈ N, is

the convex hull of its extreme points, see for example Corollary 1.4.5 of [48].
Proof of (2.2): For every unit vector x ∈ SCd, the orthogonal projection onto the
span of x, in Dirac’s notation |x(cid:105)(cid:104)x|, lies in Md. Since (cid:104)x, ax(cid:105) = (cid:104)|x(cid:105)(cid:104)x|, a(cid:105) holds
for all a ∈ Md, this shows W (F ) ⊂ L(F ) and implies conv(W (F )) ⊂ L(F ) because
L(F ) is convex.

Conversely, using Minkowski’s theorem, it suﬃces to show that every extreme
It is easy to show that the pre-image of p under
point p of L(F ) lies in W (F ).
the linear map ρ (cid:55)→ (cid:104)ρ, F(cid:105) restricted to Md is a face of Md. This face is a non-
empty compact and convex set, so it contains by Minkowski’s theorem an extreme
point ρ. Clearly ρ is an extreme point of Md and, since the extreme points of
Md are the rank-one orthogonal projection operators (see for example Proposition
4.1 of [1]), the state has the form ρ = |x(cid:105)(cid:104)x| for a unit vector x ∈ SCd. Now
p = (cid:104)ρ, F(cid:105) = (cid:104)x, F x(cid:105) ∈ W (F ) completes the proof.

3. Normal cones and ovals

We prove a characterization of ovals for the family of convex sets where every
extreme ray of a normal cone is a normal cone itself. We recall that convex support
sets belong to this family of convex sets.
Let C ⊂ Rm, m ∈ N, be a compact convex subset. The normal cone of C at
x ∈ C is N (x) := {u ∈ Rm | ∀y ∈ C : (cid:104)u, y − x(cid:105) ≤ 0}. The non-zero elements of
N (x) are known as outer normal vectors of C at x. The point x is smooth if it has
a unique outer unit normal vector. We call x a corner point [17] if dim(N (x)) = m.
We deﬁne an oval as a non-empty, convex, and compact subset of Rm each of whose
boundary points is a smooth exposed point. The normal cone N (G) := N (x) of
a non-empty face G of C is well-deﬁned as the normal cone of any point x in the
relative interior of G, that is the interior of G with respect to the topology of the
aﬃne hull of G. See for example Section 4 of [52] or Section 2.2 of [48] about the
consistency of this deﬁnition and set N (∅) := Rm. A ray is a set {λu | λ ≥ 0} ⊂ Rm
where u ∈ Rm and u (cid:54)= 0. An extreme ray of a convex set is a ray which is a face of
the given set.

What makes normal cones of L(F ) special is that all their non-empty faces are
normal cones, too. For two-dimensional convex sets C in R2 this means that a
boundary point of C is smooth unless it is the intersection of two one-dimensional
faces of C, see Section 1.2.5 of [52]. An example where this property fails is the
truncated disk {(x, y) ∈ R2 | x2 + y2 ≤ 1, x ≤ 1
3) has
two extreme rays but only one of them, the non-negative x-axis, is a normal cone.
We denote the set of exposed faces and normal cones of C by EC and NC, re-
spectively. Each of these sets is a lattice partially ordered by inclusion, that is the
inﬁmum x ∧ y and supremum x ∨ y exist for all x, y in the set. A chain in a lattice
is a totally ordered subset, its length is its cardinality minus one. The length of a
lattice is the supremum of the lengths of all its chains. Lattices of faces have been
studied earlier [3, 37], in particular these of state spaces [1], and linear images L(F )

of state spaces [51]. By Proposition 4.7 of [52], if C is not a singleton then

(3.1)

N : EC → NC

is an antitone lattice isomorphism. This means that N is a bijection and for all
exposed faces G, H we have G ⊂ H if and only if N (G) ⊃ N (H).
Ovals are smooth, unlike for example the intersection of two disks {(x, y) ∈ R2 |
(x ± 1
2)2 + y2 ≤ 1}. Still, all proper exposed faces of this example are singletons.
This suﬃces to characterize ovals within the following class of convex sets.
Theorem 3.1. Every oval in Rm has dimension m. Let C ⊂ Rm be a convex
compact subset, dim(C) = m, such that every extreme ray of every normal cone of
C is a normal cone of C. Then C is an oval if and only if all proper exposed faces
of C are singletons.

Proof: If C is an oval, then by deﬁnition its boundary is covered by singleton
faces. Since C is the disjoint union of the relative interiors of all its faces, see for
example Theorem 2.1.2 of [48], only C may be no singleton. In particular, all proper
exposed faces are singletons. By contradiction, if dim(C) < m then C lies in its own
boundary and is thus a singleton, having at least two outer normal unit vectors.

Conversely, we assume that all proper exposed faces of C are singletons. Since
every proper face lies in a proper exposed face, see for example Lemma 4.6 of [52],
it follows that all proper faces are exposed points. By assumption dim(C) = m, so
the proper faces, and hence the exposed points, cover the boundary of C.
We prove that C is smooth. By assumption, the lattice EC of exposed faces has
length two. The isomorphism (3.1) shows that the lattice NC of normal cones has
length two. Let x be a boundary point of C. As dim(C) = m, the normal cone N (x)
contains no line so it has at least one extreme ray, denoted by r (see e.g. Theorem
1.4.3 of [48]). By assumptions, the ray r is a normal cone of C. So

{0} ⊂ r ⊂ N (x) ⊂ Rm

proves N (x) = r, for otherwise NC had length three. Therefore x has a unique outer
(cid:3)
unit normal vector.

Theorem 3.1 applies to convex support sets by the following fact.

Fact 3.2. For all n, d ∈ N and F ∈ (M h
d )n the intersection of any two normal cones
(cid:54)= Rn of L(F ) is a non-empty face of each of them. Every non-empty face of every
normal cone of L(F ) is a normal cone of L(F ).

The ﬁrst assertion of Fact 3.2 is proved in Proposition 4.8 of [52]. We give two

proofs for the second one. The ﬁrst one follows Section 1.3 of [52].
1st Proof of Fact 3.2: Proposition 2.9 and 2.11 of [51] prove for every u ∈ Rn \ {0}
and for every state ρ in the relative interior of the exposed face FMd(F (u)) that F (u)
lies in the relative interior of the normal cone of Md at ρ. Hence, Proposition 7.4
and 7.6 of [52] show that every non-empty face of a normal cone of Md is a normal
cone of Md. Corollary 7.7 of [52] proves that L(F ), being a projection of Md, has
(cid:3)
the analogue property, stated in Fact 3.2.

Classiﬁcation of joint numerical ranges

Second we use a polarity to a spectrahedron. The polar of a subset C ⊂ Rm is

the closed convex set C◦ := {u ∈ Rm | ∀x ∈ C : (cid:104)x, u(cid:105) ≤ 1}.

2nd Proof of Fact 3.2: Assuming that zero is an interior point of L(F ), the positive
hull operator restricts to a lattice isomorphism from the faces of L(F )◦ onto the
non-empty faces of normal cones of L(F ), see Theorem 8.3 of [52], and further to a
lattice isomorphism from the exposed faces of L(F )◦ onto the normal cones of L(F ),
see equation (31) of [52]. The set L(F )◦ is a spectrahedron, see Section 3 of [41],
Section 2 of [12], or Remark 2.17(3) of [51] for deﬁnitions and proofs, and the claim
(cid:3)
follows then because all faces of a spectrahedron are exposed [41].

4. Exposed faces

We study exposed faces of the convex support L(F ) with a focus on large faces,

ovals, and corner points [17], which are also known as conical points [7].

We recall the spectral representation of exposed faces and introduce discriminants
and their sum of squares decomposition to study eigenvalue degeneracy. We analyze
proper faces of L(F ) for 3-by-3 matrices (d = 3). Further, we prove that the convex
support is generically an oval for at most three hermitian matrices (d ∈ N, n ≤ 3).
We discuss pre-images of exposed points under M3 → L(F ) and show that the
convex support is generically not an oval for d = 3 and n ≥ 4 — for real symmetric
matrices already when d = 3 and n ≥ 3. For d = 3 we describe L(F ) which has a
corner point.
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, d, n ∈ N are arbitrary in this section, and as before
F = (F1, . . . , Fn) ∈ (M h
d )n. Exposed faces transform very simple under linear maps,
see for example Lemma 5.4 of [52]. In formulae, the exposed face of L(F )

An algebraic aspect appears because the exposed face FMd(a) of Md, for a ∈ M h
d ,
is FMd(a) = M(pMdp) where p is the spectral projection of a corresponding to the
maximal eigenvalue of a, see [1] or [51]. Therefore, (4.1) shows
u ∈ Rn,
(4.2)
where p is the spectral projection of F (u) corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue
of F (u).
Remark 4.1 (Spectral representation of faces). A proof is given in Section 3.2 of
[21] that max{(cid:104)x, u(cid:105) | x ∈ W (F )} is the maximal eigenvalue of F (u), u ∈ Rn. This
result goes back to Toeplitz [50] for n = 2 and follows also from (2.2) and (4.2).

(FL(F )(u)) = M(pMdp),

Towards an analysis of the set of large faces L(F ), deﬁned in (1.2), equation (4.2)
shows that for such a face to exist it is necessary that F (u) has a double eigenvalue
for some u ∈ Rn \ {0}. This can be checked using discriminants and their sum of
squares decomposition.

If A is a normal 3-by-3 matrix, let v0 be the column vector with the nine entries
of the identity matrix 13. Let v1 be the column vector with the entries of A in the
same index ordering used for v0, and v2 the column vector with the entries of A2
again in the same ordering. We write the vectors into a 9-by-3 matrix (v0, v1, v2).
For a normal 3-by-3 matrix A we have [27]
(4.3)
where the sum extends over the 84 three-element subsets ν of {1, 2, 3} × {1, 2, 3}
and Mν is the minor of (v0, v1, v2) corresponding to the submatrix with rows ν.
It is worth noting that the discriminant of a real symmetric 3-by-3 matrix can be
decomposed into ﬁve squares [15].
Large faces of L(F ) were introduced in (1.2) for d = 3. Let G be one of them,
that is, let u ∈ Rn, G := FL(F )(u), dim(G) ≥ 1 and G (cid:54)= L(F ). By (4.2), the
pre-image of G under E|M3 : M3 → L(F ) has the form of M(pM3p) where p is an
orthogonal projection operator. By assumption, G is a proper face and no singleton,
so p has rank two. Thus, M(pM3p) is a three-dimensional Euclidean ball and G is
a segment, a ﬁlled ellipse, or a ﬁlled ellipsoid.
Before summarizing the preceding paragraph, we recall that an atom in a lattice
(L,≤,∧,∨, 0) with smallest element 0 is an element x ∈ L, x (cid:54)= 0, such that y ≤ x,
y (cid:54)= x implies y = 0 for all y ∈ L. Similarly, a coatom in a lattice (L,≤,∧,∨, 1)
with greatest element 1 is an element x ∈ L, x (cid:54)= 1, such that y ≥ x, y (cid:54)= x implies
y = 1 for all y ∈ L.
Lemma 4.2. Let F be a sequence of n ∈ N hermitian 3-by-3 matrices. Every proper
face of L(F ) which is not a singleton is a segment, a ﬁlled ellipse, or a ﬁlled ellipsoid.
Moreover, that face is an exposed face of L(F ) and a coatom of EL(F ).

Proof: Every proper face G of L(F ) lies in a proper exposed face (see for example
Lemma 4.6 of [52]) which is a segment, ellipse, or ellipsoid, as mentioned above.
Since G is no singleton, it is equal to that proper exposed face. It is a coatom of
the lattice EL(F ) of exposed faces since ellipses and ellipsoids have no segments or
(cid:3)
ellipses on the relative boundary.

The generic convex support of at most three hermitian matrices is an oval.

d )n such that L(F ) is an oval is open and dense in (M h

Theorem 4.3. Let n ∈ {1, 2, 3} and d ≥ 2. Then the set of n-tuples of hermitian
d-by-d matrices F ∈ (M h
d )n.
Proof: For n = 1, 2, 3 and d ∈ N the set O1 of all F ∈ (M h
d )n where every matrix
in the pencil {F (u) | u ∈ Rn \ {0}} has d simple eigenvalues is open and dense in
d )n, this was shown in Prop. 4.9 of [21]. Hence, for F ∈ O1 all proper exposed
(M h
faces of L(F ) are singletons by (4.2). Secondly, since n + 1 ≤ dimR(M h
d ) = d2
holds by the assumptions n ≤ 3 and d ≥ 2, it is easy to prove that 1d, F1, . . . , Fn

Classiﬁcation of joint numerical ranges

10
are linearly independent for F in an open and dense subset O2 of (M h
d )n, that is
dim(L(F )) = n holds for F ∈ O2. The extreme rays of every normal cone of L(F )
are normal cones by Fact 3.2. Hence Theorem 3.1 proves that L(F ) is an oval for
all F in O1 ∩ O2. The proof is completed by observing that in a metric space the
(cid:3)
intersection of two open and dense subsets is dense.

Conversely, if a double maximal eigenvalue of F (u) fails to generate a large face

of L(F ) then L(F ) has the special shape of a Euclidean ball.

If D ≥ 3 then ϕ is unique in [0, π). The convex support L(F ϕ) is the unit ball of
RD, and the pre-image of (x1, . . . , xD) ∈ SD−1 is a singleton unless x1 = 1. If the
matrices F are real symmetric then necessarily D ≤ 3 and ϕ = 0 mod π.

Proof: Let x ∈ L(F ) be an exposed point, say {x} = FL(F )(u0) for a unit vector
u0 ∈ Rn. Applying an orthogonal transformation of Rn we take u0 := (1, 0, . . . , 0).
By (4.2) we have E|−1M3
(x) = M(pM3p) where p is the spectral projection of F (u0)
corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue. Since E|−1M3
(x) is not a singleton and
not equal to M3 it follows that p has rank two. Notice for all i = 1, . . . , n that
pFip is a scalar multiple of p. This is clear for i = 1 because p is a spectral
projection of F1. For i ≥ 2 one could otherwise ﬁnd two points ρ1, ρ2 ∈ M(pM3p)
with (cid:104)ρ1, Fi(cid:105) (cid:54)= (cid:104)ρ2, Fi(cid:105) but then {x0} = FL(F )(u0) = E(M(pM3p)) could not be a
singleton. Applying a unitary similarity to all matrices F we take p = diag(1, 1, 0).
Further transformations from (1.1) then show D ≤ 4 and we can choose to have F
i deﬁned above. Orthogonal similarity
equivalent to F ϕ := (F ϕ
can be used if F consists of real symmetric matrices where D ≤ 3 follows and
where F ϕ is real symmetric. For D ≥ 3 it is easy to see that two sequences F ϕ are
non-equivalent modulo (1.1) for diﬀerent values of ϕ mod π.
Let n = D ≤ 4. The support function h(u) := maxx∈L(F ϕ)(cid:104)u, x(cid:105) is the maximal
eigenvalue of F ϕ(u), where u = (u1, . . . , un) ∈ Rn (Remark 4.1). For a unit vector
u the matrix F ϕ(u) has eigenvalues {−1, u1, 1} so h(u) = 1 and this shows that
L(F ϕ) is the unit ball. The pre-image of the exposed face {u0} = FL(F ϕ)(u0) is a
three-dimensional ball because F ϕ
1 has a double maximal eigenvalue (4.2). To see
that u0 is the unique extreme point having more than one pre-image it suﬃces to
show for n ≥ 2 that F ϕ(u) has no double eigenvalue for any unit vector u which
is not collinear with u0. The latter holds because the discriminant of F ϕ(u) is

δ(F ϕ(u)) = 4(u2

We notice that Lemma 4.4 generalizes a theorem of [34]. Now we can prove for
n ≥ 5 hermitian matrices of order 3 that the set L(F ) diﬀers generically from an oval
(likely also for n = 4). For real symmetric matrices of order 3 it diﬀers generically
from an oval already when n = 4 (and likely also for n = 3).

A geometric interpretation is straight forward for 3-by-3 matrices F ∈ (M h

Remark 4.5. Let d (cid:54)= 0,±1 mod 8. If n ≥ 4 then Theorem D of [19] shows that
d exists a point u (cid:54)= 0 in Rn such that the matrix
for every linear map Ψ : Rn → M h
Ψ(u) has a multiple eigenvalue. Moreover, if the range of Ψ is replaced by the space
of real symmetric d-by-d matrices then Theorem B of [19] shows that n ≥ 3 suﬃces
for the existence of such a point.
3 )n.
If n ≥ 9 then L(F ) cannot have an interior point and is not an oval. This is
clear because D ≤ dim(M3) = 8 holds for D := dim(L(F )). On the contrary, let
4 ≤ n ≤ 8. Then D = n holds generically. The preceding paragraph shows that there
is u ∈ Rn such that F (u) has a multiple eigenvalue which we can assume a maximal
eigenvalue (because d = 3). Then (4.2) proves that L(F ) has an exposed face which
is the image of a three-dimensional Euclidean ball under the map M3 → L(F ).
Thus, L(F ) ⊂ Rn has a large face unless F is equivalent modulo (1.1) to a tuple
F ϕ of Lemma 4.4. The set L(F ϕ) is a Euclidean ball of dimension at most four.
So D ≥ 5 suﬃces that L(F ) has a large face and so L(F ) has generically a large
face when n ≥ 5. For D = 4 the Euclidean balls of Lemma 4.4 appear very special,
which suggests that L(F ) is generically no oval neither for n = 4.

The case of real symmetric 3-by-3 matrices F is an analogue to the hermitian case
except for the fact that the dimension n for a level crossing is reduced by one as is
the dimension of the exceptional Euclidean balls of Lemma 4.4.

We ﬁnish the section with an analysis of corner points of a subset C ⊂ Rm,
i.e. points with an m-dimensional normal cone. A set K ⊂ Rm is a convex cone
if K is convex and non-empty and if x ∈ K, λ ≥ 0 implies λx ∈ K. A point
p ∈ C is called conical point [7] if C ⊂ p + K holds for a closed convex cone
K ⊂ Rm containing no line. Recall that the polar (deﬁnition above the 2nd proof
of Fact 3.2) of a closed convex cone K ⊂ Rm is a closed convex cone is given by
K◦ = {u ∈ Rm | ∀x ∈ K : (cid:104)x, u(cid:105) ≤ 0}.
For any point p of a compact convex subset C ⊂ Rm we have C ⊂ p + N (p)◦
where N (p) is the normal cone of C at p, see e.g. Section 2.2 and equation (2.2) of
[48]. Therefore, and since K ⊃ N (p)◦ holds if and only if K◦ ⊂ N (p), we see that
(4.4)
Since K contains no line if and only if K◦ has full dimension m, it follows for all
p ∈ C that p is a corner point of C if and only if p is a conical point of C.
Lemma 4.6. Let F be a sequence of n hermitian d-by-d matrices, n, d ∈ N. If p is
a conical point, or equivalently a corner point, of L(F ) then F is unitarily reducible.
There exists a non-zero vector x ∈ Cd such that Fix = pix holds for i = 1, . . . , n.

K◦ ⊂ N (p) ⇐⇒ C ⊂ p + K.

Proof: The equivalence of conical point and corner point is proved in the para-
(cid:3)

graph of (4.4). The remaining claims are proved in Proposition 2.5 of [7].

We derive a classiﬁcation of corner points for 3-by-3 matrices.

Lemma 4.7. Let F be a sequence of n hermitian 3-by-3 matrices, n ∈ N. If L(F )
has a corner point p then D := dim(L(F )) satisﬁes D ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. The sequence
F is unitarily reducible, there exists a unitary U ∈ M3 such that U∗F U has the
block-diagonal form U∗F U = ( (p1) ⊕ G1, . . . , (pn) ⊕ Gn ) with G ∈ (M h
2 )n. The
convex support L(F ) is (we ignore D = 0, 1) the convex hull of p and of

• (D = 2) a segment whose aﬃne hull does not contain p or an ellipse whose
• (D = 3) an ellipse whose aﬃne hull does not contain p or an ellipsoid whose
• (D = 4) an ellipsoid whose aﬃne hull does not contain p.

aﬃne hull contains p but whose convex hull does not contain p,

Proof: Lemma 4.6 proves that F is unitarily similar to the described block diag-
onal form. Thus, it is easy to prove that L(F ) is the convex hull of p and L(G).
Since L(G) is a singleton, a segment, a ﬁlled ellipse, or a ﬁlled ellipsoid, only the
(cid:3)
cases listed above are possible.

5. Arguments for the classification

large faces. We will embed a graph into the union(cid:83)

We provide the arguments which we use in the introduction to prove the clas-
siﬁcation of the convex support L(F ) ∈ R3 of three hermitian 3-by-3 matrices
F = (F1, F2, F3). Here we study intersections of large faces and we deﬁne a graph
embedding.
A proper face of L(F ) which is no singleton is by Lemma 4.2 an exposed face
of the form of a segment or ellipse and is further a coatom of the lattice EL(F ) of
exposed faces. The set of these faces was denoted in (1.2) by L(F ), they were called
G∈L(F ) G. Lemma 5.1 and 5.4
rely on the classiﬁcation of the numerical range of a 3-by-3 matrix [29, 30], namely
on the fact that the numerical range of a 3-by-3 matrix with two one-dimensional
faces is a triangle or the convex hull of an ellipse and a point outside the ellipse. We
denote by P the projection R3 → R2, (x1, x2, x3) (cid:55)→ (x1, x2).
Lemma 5.1. Let F ∈ (M h
3 )3. If G1, G2 ∈ L(F ) then, after an aﬃne transformation
(1.1) acting on R3, the projected faces P (G1) and P (G2) are one-dimensional faces
of L(F1, F2). In particular G1 ∩ G2 (cid:54)= ∅ holds.

Proof: We apply an aﬃne transformation such that an outer normal vector of Gi
is orthogonal to the x3-axis, i = 1, 2. Since L(F1, F2) = P (F (L)) holds, it follows
that P (G1) and P (G2) are exposed faces of L(F1, F2). If P (G1) ∩ P (G2) (cid:54)= ∅ then
the claim G1∩ G2 (cid:54)= ∅ follows. A particular case is when neither P (G1) nor P (G2) is
a singleton when the classiﬁcation of the numerical range of a 3-by-3 matrix proves
P (G1) ∩ P (G2) (cid:54)= ∅.
On the contrary, let P (G1) ∩ P (G2) = ∅ with P (G1) = {x} for an exposed
point x ∈ L(F1, F2). Then x has more than one pre-image under the linear map
M3 → L(F1, F2), so Lemma 4.4 shows that L(F1, F2) is an ellipse and that x is
the unique exposed point with more than one pre-image. All proper faces of the
ellipse are singletons hence P (G2) = {y} is a singleton, and by the same reasoning
used for x, the exposed point y has more than one pre-image. This contradicts the
(cid:3)
uniqueness of an exposed point with more than one pre-image.

Lemma 5.2 relies on studies of normal cones.

Lemma 5.2. Let F ∈ (M h
L(F ) are mutually distinct then G1 ∩ G2 ∩ G3 = ∅.

3 )3 and let L(F ) have no corner point. If G1, G2, G3 ∈
Proof: The Gi’s are mutually distinct coatoms so G := G1 ∩ G2 ∩ G3 is strictly
included in Gi for i = 1, 2, 3. The antitone isomorphism (3.1) shows that N (Gi)

K. Szymański et al.

13

is strictly included in N (G), Fact 3.2 shows that N (Gi) is a face of N (G), and a
separation theorem, see e.g. Theorem 1.3.2 of [48], shows dim(N (Gi)) ≥ 1. By con-
tradiction we assume G (cid:54)= ∅. Then, since L(F ) has no corner points, dim(N (G)) ≤ 2
follows. This implies dim(N (Gi)) = 1 for i = 1, 2, 3 and dim(N (G)) = 2. But this
is impossible, as a two-dimensional convex cone cannot have three one-dimensional
faces. Therefore G = ∅ holds.
(cid:3)

The existence of a corner point of L(F ), which is not allowed in Thm 5.3, yields
the simple situation where F is unitarily reducible [7] and L(F ) is one of the few
objects of Lemma 4.7. In all other cases we embed a complete graph into the union of
large faces having a vertex c(G) located at the centroid of every large face G ∈ L(F ).
Theorem 5.3 (Graph embedding). Let F ∈ (M h
3 )3 and let L(F ) have no corner
point. Each two distinct faces G, H ∈ L(F ) intersect in a unique point p(G, H).
Deﬁne an edge between the vertices c(G) and c(H) as the union of the segment
between c(G) and p(G, H) and the segment between p(G, H) and c(H). Distinct
edges of the graph intersect at most in a vertex of the graph.

Proof: Lemma 5.1 shows that two given faces G, H ∈ L(F ) do intersect. Being
faces of L(F ) and ellipses or segments, G (cid:54)= H intersect in a unique extreme point
p(G, H) of L(F ). By construction, for all Gi, Hi ∈ L(F ), Gi (cid:54)= Hi, i = 1, 2, if the
edge between c(G1) and c(H1) intersects the edge between c(G2) and c(H2) outside
of a vertex then p(G1, H1) = p(G2, H2) follows.
In that case Lemma 5.2 shows
{G1, H1} = {G2, H2} which means that the two edges are equal.
(cid:3)

Unless L(F ) has a corner point, L(F ) contains at most one segment.

Lemma 5.4. Let F ∈ (M h
then L(F ) has a corner point.

3 )3. If L(F ) has two distinct faces which are segments

Proof: Let G, H ∈ L(F ) be distinct segments. Lemma 5.1 proves that, after an
aﬃne transformation, L(F1, F2) has two one-dimensional faces. Either L(F1, F2) is
a triangle or the convex hull of an ellipse and a point outside of the ellipse.

In the ﬁrst case, if L(F1, F2) is a triangle, another aﬃne transformation allows us

to assume that

Now L(F1, F2) is the convex hull of (0,−1), (0, 0), and (−1, 0). Equation (4.2)
shows that the segment FL(F )(1, 0), respectively FL(F )(0, 1), is the image of a three-
dimensional ball M(p1M3p1), respectively M(p2M3p2), where the diagonal ma-
trix p1 := diag(1, 0, 1), respectively p2 := (1, 1, 0), is the spectral projection of
Fi corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue zero, i = 1, 2. Let v := (1, 0, 0),
v1 := (0, 0, 1), and v2 := (0, 1, 0). The matrix of p1F2p1 in the basis (v, v1) is
diag(0,−1). Since FL(F )(1, 0) is a segment, p1F3p1 must be a linear combination of
0 = p1F1p1 and of p1F2p1. Therefore the oﬀ-diagonal terms (cid:104)v, F3v1(cid:105) = (F3)1,3 and
(cid:104)v1, F3v(cid:105) = (F3)1,3, must vanish. Analogously, since FL(F )(0, 1) is a segment we have
(F3)1,2 = (F3)2,1 = 0. This proves that F is unitarily reducible. It is easy to see that
(0, 0, (F3)1,1) is a corner point of L(F ) because L(F ) is the convex hull of the point
(0, 0, (F3)1,1) and of L( ˜F ) for the triple of 2-by-2 matrices ˜Fi,j := Fi+1,j+1, i, j = 1, 2,
where L( ˜F ) projects to the segment between (−1, 0) and (0,−1) in the x1-x2 plane.

Similarly as for a triangle we argue when L(F1, F2) is the convex hull of an ellipse
and a point outside of the ellipse. Here, we have several aﬃnely inequivalent cases.
Lemma 5.1 of [49] proves that there is a > 1 such that (F1, F2) is equivalent modulo

An aﬃne transformation then allows us to assume that F1 = F (cid:48)

6. Examples

We analyze and depict examples of convex support sets L(F ) of three hermitian
3-by-3 matrices which have dimension three and no corner points, thereby proving
that the corresponding eight classes of Table 1 are non-empty.
For all examples we compute the outer normal vectors u ∈ R3 of proper exposed
face of L(F ) whose pre-image is not a singleton (we explain the method in Exam-
ple 6.2 and just write formula and results later on). The question is left to the
reader whether these faces are large faces and whether they are segments or ellipses.
Indeed, the answer is a straightforward computation with 2-by-2 matrices (4.2): If
F (u) has a maximal eigenvalue with spectral projection p then the exposed face
FL(F )(u) is the convex support of the compressions of F1, F2, F3 to the range of p.
The graphics of Figures 2 and 3 were computed with Wolfram Mathematica using
a heuristic method for which we have no proof of correctness: Recall from (1.3) the
projective subvariety SF of PC4. The dual variety S∧
F is a variety in PC4 which is
the closure of the set of tangent hyperplanes to SF at non-singular points [20, 18],
a hyperplane {(u0 : u1 : u2 : u3) ∈ PC4 | u0x0 + u1x1 + u2x2 + u3x3 = 0} being
identiﬁed with the point (x0 : x1 : x2 : x3) ∈ PC4. The boundary generating surface
F (R) of F is [13] the real part of the aﬃne part x0 = 1 of S∧
S∧
F . We obtain an
equation for S∧

F (R) by computing a Groebner basis of the ideal generated by

p := det(u01 + u1F1 + u2F2 + u3F3),

∂uip − xi,

i = 0, 1, 2, 3,

when the variables (u0, u1, u2, u3) are eliminated ([14], Sec. 3.1). This ideal is a
principal ideal in the following examples, generated by a polynomial ˜q(x0, x1, x2, x3).
The boundary generating surface S∧

Remark 6.1. Notice that the polynomials ∂uip− xi are inhomogeneous and do not
deﬁne a variety in the projective space PC8 or PR8. Alternatively, Algorithm 5.1 of
[46] uses the homogenous 2-by-2 minors of the matrix

F (R) is the zero set in R3 of the polynomial

q(x1, x2, x3) := ˜q(1, x1, x2, x3).

The equation q(x1, x2, x3) = 0 of the boundary generating surface S∧
F (R) is in-
teresting in another respect. Recall for n = 2 that the convex hull of S∧
F (R) is the
numerical range of F1 + i F2 [29]. The analogue for n ≥ 3, that the convex hull of
S∧
F (R) is the convex support L(F ), is wrong [13] because S∧
F (R) can contain lines
while L(F ) is bounded. These lines are Zariski-closed proper subsets of S∧
F (R) which
in our examples is an irreducible surface. The phenomenon of non-constant dimen-
sion is well-known for real algebraic sets and cannot happen for complex algebraic
sets, see Sec. 3.1 of [8]. We leave it to the reader to ﬁnd lines in S∧
F (R) by testing
the coordinate axes to satisfy q(x1, x2, x3) = 0.

Let us now discuss the examples. We skip the ovals and refer to Section 4 of [31]

for examples of them.

The hermitian square in the sum of squares representation (4.3) of the discriminant
of F (u), corresponding to ν := {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)}, is
2 + u2

|Mν|2 = (u2

Thus (4.2) proves that FL(F )(1, 0, 0) is the unique proper exposed face of L(F ) whose
pre-image under E|M3 is no singleton. Lemma 4.2 shows that FL(F )(1, 0, 0) is in fact
the unique proper face of L(F ) with that property.
