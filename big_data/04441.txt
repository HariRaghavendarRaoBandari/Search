REVEALING THE z ∼ 2.5 COSMIC WEB WITH 3D Lyα FOREST TOMOGRAPHY:

A DEFORMATION TENSOR APPROACH

Khee-Gan Lee1,3 & Martin White1,2

To be submitted to ApJ

ABSTRACT

Studies of cosmological objects should take into account their positions within the cosmic web of large-
scale structure. Unfortunately, the cosmic web has only been extensively mapped at low-redshifts
(z < 1), using galaxy redshifts as tracers of the underlying density ﬁeld. At z > 1, the required galaxy
densities are inaccessible for the foreseeable future, but 3D reconstructions of Lyα forest absorption
in closely-separated background QSOs and star-forming galaxies already oﬀer a detailed window into
z ∼ 2 − 3 large-scale structure. We quantify the utility of such maps for studying the cosmic web
by using realistic z = 2.5 Lyα forest simulations matched to observational properties of upcoming
surveys. A deformation tensor-based analysis is used to classify voids, sheets, ﬁlaments and nodes in
the ﬂux, which is compared to those determined from the underlying dark matter ﬁeld. We ﬁnd an
extremely good correspondence, with 70% of the volume in the ﬂux maps correctly classiﬁed relative
to the dark matter web, and 99% classiﬁed to within 1 eigenvalue. This compares favorably to the
performance of galaxy-based classiﬁers with even the highest galaxy densities at low-redshift. We ﬁnd
that narrow survey geometries can degrade the cosmic web recovery unless the survey is (cid:38) 60 h−1 Mpc
or (cid:38) 1 deg on the sky. We also examine halo abundances as a function of the cosmic web, and ﬁnd
a clear dependence as a function of ﬂux overdensity, but little explicit dependence on the cosmic
web. These methods will provide a new window on cosmological environments of galaxies at this very
special time in galaxy formation, “high noon”, and on overall properties of cosmological structures at
this epoch.

1. INTRODUCTION

The process of gravitational instability from Gaussian
initial conditions generically produces a beaded, ﬁlamen-
tary network within which dark matter halos and associ-
ated cosmological objects form. As the Universe evolves,
matter ﬂows out of voids and through sheets before ac-
creting along ﬁlaments into nodes or halos. This dis-
tinctive pattern of voids, sheets, ﬁlaments and nodes is
known as the “cosmic web” (Zeldovich et al. 1982; Shan-
darin & Zeldovich 1983; Einasto et al. 1984; Bond et al.
1996; Colberg 2007) and forms the context within which
structure formation takes place, and populations of cos-
mological objects form and evolve. The cosmic web has
been seen in the distribution of galaxies in the local Uni-
verse, and it is a robust prediction of cosmological sim-
ulations dating back many years. However, an under-
standing of the evolution of objects within the context
of this cosmic web remains a major, unsolved problem in
observational cosmology.

It has become increasingly apparent that the “envi-
ronment” of galaxies plays an important role in their
morphology, evolution, the evolution of their stellar pop-
ulations and their level of nuclear activity (e.g., Dressler
1980; Kauﬀmann et al. 2004; Blanton et al. 2005; Blanton

& Berlind 2007). It is still an open question, especially
at high redshift, to what degree these eﬀects depend on
the immediate neighbors of a galaxy or extend to large-
scale tidal ﬁeld and the rich structures in which these
objects are embedded. At low redshift, galaxy color and
morphology depend primarily on local density (Yan et al.
2013) as does the galaxy luminosity function (e.g. most
recently: Eardley et al. 2015) although ﬁlamentarity has
a direct eﬀect on galaxy formation (Guo et al. 2014) and
possibly star-formation (Snedden et al. 2016). There is
evidence that dwarf galaxy evolution may be aﬀected by
the cosmic web (Ben´ıtez-Llambay et al. 2013), as may
star-formation in galaxies falling into clusters along ﬁla-
ments (Porter et al. 2008). The properties of dark matter
halos are seen to depend on their locations within the web
(Hahn et al. 2007; Ludlow & Porciani 2011); with low
mass void galaxies being younger and halo spins4 of sheet
galaxies lying preferentially within the plane of symme-
try of the mass distribution. Dubois et al. (2014), us-
ing hydrodynamic simulations, predict that spins of red
and blue galaxies should align perpendicularly and paral-
lel, respectively, with ﬁlaments at high redshift (z (cid:38) 1).
There is currently very little observational information
about how galaxy properties depend upon the web at red-
shifts near the peak of cosmic star-formation (z ∼ 1.5−3)
or beyond.

The cosmic web is most frequently studied in the distri-
bution of optical galaxies from spectroscopic redshift sur-

this could be a source of systematic error for weak-lensing cosmic
shear analyses.

veys. In the past decade, studies of the nearby universe
(z < 0.2) (Bond et al. 2010; Alpaslan et al. 2015; Leclercq
et al. 2015) have reached a high degree of maturity, char-
acterizing the web and its denizens in some detail (see
Alpaslan et al. 2015 for a recent, low-z, example with ref-
erences to the earlier literature). For this kind of analysis
a high number density of galaxies with spectroscopic red-
shifts is required, which becomes increasingly expensive
at higher-redshift. This makes it diﬃcult to accumulate
a sample of sub-L(cid:63) galaxies (with n−1/3 ∼ Mpc) over
cosmologically representative volumes that can simulta-
neously resolve cosmic web components, which charac-
teristically span of tens of Mpc (e.g. Colberg 2007; Stark
et al. 2015a,b) As an example, the ongoing VIPERS sur-
vey (Guzzo et al. 2014) on the 8.2 m VLT represents the
current state-of-the-art in terms of galaxy redshift sur-
veys that could map the cosmic web at higher redshifts.
With a mean redshift of (cid:104)z(cid:105) ∼ 0.7, VIPERS required
> 400 hrs of observing time to achieve a number density
of ¯n (cid:39) 2 × 10−3 h3Mpc−3, or a typical spatial resolution
of ¯n−1/3 (cid:39) 8 h−1Mpc, which is marginal for studying the
cosmic web. This route to mapping the cosmic web at
z > 1, over cosmological volumes, would thus appear to
be a task only feasible with future 30 m-class telescopes,
and even then requiring massive investments of telescope
time.

However, another tracer of the dark matter is the in-
tergalactic medium (IGM). We have recently shown (Lee
et al. 2014b, 2016) that observations of the IGM Lyα
forest absorption in closely-separated background QSOs
and star-forming galaxies (LBGs) at z ∼ 2 − 3 can allow
3D reconstructions of the IGM absorption that resolve
scales of several Mpc. Lee et al. (2014a) showed that ap-
plying Wiener-ﬁlter reconstruction methods to simulated
sightlines, matched to upcoming data in terms of trans-
verse separation, resolution, and signal-to-noise, yield
maps that agree visually with the underlying matter den-
sity ﬁeld smoothed on similar scales. Stark et al. (2015a)
and Stark et al. (2015b) (hereafter S15a and S15b, re-
spectively) showed that such maps can be used to detect
large samples of high-redshift galaxy protoclusters and
voids, respectively.
In both cases, simulated IGM to-
mographic maps were found to recover these extended
structures with good purity and completeness.

This IGM reconstruction is being pioneered by the
CLAMATO survey, conducted on the LRIS spectrograph
(Oke et al. 1995) on the 10.3 m diameter Keck-I telescope.
CLAMATO, which is completing its pilot phase at the
time of writing, aims to map the IGM with an eﬀective
spatial resolution of ∼ 3 h−1 Mpc over a ∼ 1 deg2 area at
2.2 < z < 2.5, yielding a total, comoving, survey volume
of ∼ 106 h−3 Mpc3. In addition, in the near future, the
Subaru Prime-Focus Spectrograph (PFS) – a wide-ﬁeld
and massively-multiplexed spectrograph capable of tar-
geting over 2000 objects within a ∼ 1deg2 ﬁeld-of-view
– will commence operation (Takada et al. 2014). Since
PFS samples a smaller telescope aperture (8.2 m diame-
ter) and is less blue-sensitive than Keck-LRIS, it cannot
reach similar depths and sightline densities as CLAM-
ATO but will be especially well suited to tomographic
mapping over much larger areas (∼ 20 deg2) and volumes
(∼ 108 h−1 Mpc), albeit with a coarser eﬀective spatial

resolution (∼ 5 h−1 Mpc).

Voids and protoclusters roughly correspond to the two
limiting types of structures in the cosmic web, as well
as being the largest spatially coherent structures. Their
detection and characterization thus form a natural start-
ing point for surveys such as CLAMATO, which explains
the focus of S15a and S15b. Here we analyze the same
z = 2.5 simulated IGM tomographic maps as S15a, S15b
to see whether maps such as those returned by CLAM-
ATO, or a future PFS survey, could further classify the
cosmic web, i.e. into voids, sheets, ﬁlaments and nodes.
As we shall see, there is a remarkable agreement between
the structures recovered from realistic IGM maps, and
those in the underlying dark matter (DM) ﬁeld. We will
also conduct a preliminary investigation into the varia-
tion of halo abundances in diﬀerent overdensity and cos-
mic environments of the high-redshift cosmic web, which
is intended to motivate more detailed in this direction us-
ing either hydrodynamical simulations or semi-analytic
galaxy formation models.

This paper is not the ﬁrst attempt at analyzing the 3D
cosmic web in IGM simulations: Caucci et al. (2008) had
previously performed an analysis of cosmic web ﬁlaments
in simulated IGM tomographic maps using the Skeleton
algorithm (Sousbie et al. 2009). They considered noise-
less mock spectra with no observational eﬀects taken into
account except random sightline sampling. We take the
next steps by including further observational eﬀects tai-
lored to existing and near-future surveys, with an eye to
the recovery of the z ∼ 2.5 cosmic web in the observable
IGM (and its relation to the web in dark matter).

2. SIMULATIONS

In this paper, we use the same, numerical, N -body
simulations described in S15a and S15b. These are
dark matter-only simulations with 25603 equal-mass
(8.6 × 107 h−1 M(cid:12)) particles in a periodic box with
L = 256 h−1 Mpc on a side. The comoving volume is
large enough to encompass the largest cosmic structures
(see e.g. S15b), while the mass resolution is suﬃcient to
model the Lyα forest absorption at z ∼ 2 − 3 using the
“ﬂuctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation” (Croft et al.
1998; Meiksin & White 2001; White et al. 2010; Rorai
et al. 2013; McQuinn 2015).
The simulation adopted a ﬂat ΛCDM cosmology with
Ωm ≈ 0.31, Ωbh2 ≈ 0.022, h = 0.6777, ns = 0.9611
and σ8 = 0.83, consistent with Planck Collaboration
et al. (2014). The initial conditions were generated
using second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory at
z = 150, with subsequent evolution of the particle posi-
tions and velocities solved using the TreePM code (White
2002). The z = 2.5 particle positions and velocities were
used to generate Lyα forest absorption skewers using
the ﬂuctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation, assum-
ing a power-law IGM temperature-density relationship,
T = T0(ρ/¯ρ)γ−1 with slope γ = 1.6 (consistent with ob-
servational constraints, e.g., Rudie et al. 2012; Lee et al.
2015).

To construct mock observations, we generated 409600
absorption skewers with a transverse
spacing of
0.4 h−1 Mpc in the xy plane. We work throughout in
terms of the Lyα forest ﬂux ﬂuctuation

δF = F/(cid:104)F(cid:105) − 1,

(1)

Characterizing z ∼ 2.5 Cosmic Web With Lyα Forest Tomography

where F = exp(−τ ) is the transmitted ﬂux fraction and
τ is the Lyα optical depth. For brevity, we will use ‘ﬂux’
to refer to δF .

For this analysis, we use the publicly-available simula-
tion products5 described in S15a. Since we aim to com-
pare the potentially observable IGM ﬁeld with the under-
lying cosmic web in the large-scale structure, we will use
both the mock IGM tomographic maps and the gridded,
DM density ﬁeld from these simulations. For the former,
we use primarily the d25 ﬂux maps, which are Wiener-
ﬁltered reconstructions of randomly-selected simulation
skewers using the method described in S15a, speciﬁcally
designed to match the properties of the CLAMATO pi-
lot data of Lee et al. (2014b). These maps assumed an
average sightline separation of (cid:104)d⊥(cid:105) = 2.5 h−1 Mpc, with
line-of-sight Gaussian smoothing equivalent to a spectral
resolution of R ≡ λ/∆λ = 1100 with pixel noise added
as described in S15a. The resulting tomographic maps,
binned on a 1 h−1 Mpc grid, should accurately reﬂect the
main properties of CLAMATO observations.

To compare with a hypothetical survey that might
be carried out with the upcoming Subaru PFS instru-
ment, we will also use the d40 map created with d⊥ =
4 h−1 Mpc sightline spacing. This decreased sightline
spacing reﬂects a shallower (g ∼ 24 rather than g ∼ 24.5
in CLAMATO) but wider survey (∼ 20 deg2 rather than
∼ 1 deg2) that might be better suited to the lower
throughput but much wider ﬁeld-of-view of the PFS.

To validate the cosmic web recovery from the tomo-
graphic Lyα ﬂux maps, we will adopt as underlying
‘truth’ the z = 2.5 redshift-space dark matter overdensity
ﬁeld ∆dm = 1+δdm = ρm/(cid:104)ρm(cid:105) binned into a regular grid
with 1 h−1 Mpc cell size and then Gaussian-smoothed to
match each tomographic map.

3. COSMIC WEB CLASSIFICATION SCHEME

There are numerous methods by which one can classify
the elements of the cosmic web (see Cautun et al. 2014,
for a summary). In this paper, it will prove convenient
to use a Hessian-based, “deformation tensor”, approach,
ﬁrst suggested by Zel’dovich (1970). This method can be
motivated by a linearization of the equations of motion
around extrema (Hahn et al. 2007). It has been applied
by Hahn et al. (2007) and Forero-Romero et al. (2009) to
analyze the cosmic web in modern cosmological simula-
tions, as well as to galaxy redshift survey data by Eardley
et al. (2015) and we refer the reader to those papers for
further discussion.

The Hessian matrix needs to be computed on a
smoothed density or ﬂux ﬁeld. We therefore smooth
our gridded ﬁelds with a Gaussian kernel whose width
is chosen to be approximately 1.5× the average sight-
line separation of the mock data from which the to-
mographic ﬂux maps are reconstructed. This reduces
reconstruction noise from ﬁnite sightline sampling and
pixel noise (Caucci et al. 2008). Speciﬁcally we smooth
by RG = 4 h−1 Mpc for the d25 reconstructions (d⊥ =
2.5 h−1 Mpc) and RG = 6 h−1 Mpc for the d40 maps
(d⊥ = 4 h−1 Mpc). We also smooth the DM ﬁeld by the
same RG in order to directly compare with the smoothed
tomographic map. The RG = 4 h−1 Mpc scale is, conve-
5 http://tinyurl.com/lya-tomography-sim-data

niently, the smoothing used in several recent analyses of
low-redshift galaxy surveys and simulations (e.g., Eard-
ley et al. 2015). This could, in principle, facilitate a
comparison between the observed cosmic web at z ∼ 2.5
and z ∼ 0.2 from CLAMATO and GAMA once both
data sets are available.

We would like to classify the cosmic web components
in both the dark matter and the IGM. For the dark mat-
ter, the method largely follows that from (Forero-Romero
et al. 2009): after smoothing, we compute the deforma-
tion tensor of the density ﬁeld, which is the Hessian of
the (pseudo-)gravitational potential, Φ:

Tij =

∂2Φ

∂xi∂xj

.

(2)

This is most conveniently calculated in Fourier space,
where ∇2 ˜Φ = k2 ˜Φ = δk (in units with 4πG = 1) and
therefore

(cid:101)Tij((cid:126)k) =

kikj
k2

δk,

(3)

where δk is the Fourier-space overdensity. This is then
inverse Fourier-transformed into conﬁguration space to
obtain Tij.

We solve for the three eigenvalues of Tij, λk, at each
grid point in the map. The geometric cosmic web classi-
ﬁcation is determined by the number of eigenvalues that
are greater than a given threshold6, λk ≥ λth: voids,
sheets, ﬁlaments and nodes, respectively, have zero, one,
two, and three eigenvalues greater than the threshold.
The choice of λth is a free parameter, related to a charac-
teristic collapse time-scale (Forero-Romero et al. 2009),
that in practice primarily governs the relative volume-
ﬁlling factors of the diﬀerent components. Many dif-
ferent criteria have been considered in the literature for
determining λth, e.g. percolation of voids and ﬁlaments
(Forero-Romero et al. 2009) or equipartition of the cos-
mic web components (Eardley et al. 2015). In this work,
we set λth to yield a void fraction roughly similar to that
from S15b, which was approximately 19% and 17% for
the RG = [4, 6] h−1 Mpc maps, respectively.

To classify positions in the simulation in terms of the
cosmic web for the IGM, we simply substitute the ﬂux
Fourier modes from the mock IGM tomographic maps
(δF,k) for δk in Eq. (3). This produces the IGM pseudo-
deformation tensor. As high ﬂux corresponds to low den-
sity, we reverse the sign of the eigenvalue threshold cri-
terion for classifying voids, sheets, ﬁlaments and nodes.
Thus we count eigenvalues for which λk ≤ λth,F . Again,
λth,F is chosen to give the void fraction found by S15b.
In practice, λth,F (cid:54)= λth. This method results in a close
relationship between the classiﬁcation of the cosmic web
elements in the dark matter and the ﬂux as we shall now
see.

4. COSMIC WEB RECOVERY

The cosmic web recovered from the RG = 4 h−1 Mpc
DM ﬁeld and d25 tomographic ﬂux maps are illustrated
in Fig. 1, with the corresponding volume-ﬁlling fractions
of voids, sheets, ﬁlaments, and nodes tabulated in Ta-
ble 1. Fig. 2 shows the same for the RG = 6 h−1 Mpc DM
6 By contrast the number of positive eigenvalues is the dimension
of the stable manifold of the dynamical system at the ﬁxed points.

maps with the d40 reconstructions. Visually, the voids in
the maps appear to trace the lowest-density regions while
nodes trace the highest-density regions, as expected. Our
choice of threshold also seems, by eye, to yield sheets and
ﬁlaments that are appropriately pancake- and tendril-
like, respectively.

As in other studies (e.g., Hahn et al. 2007; Alonso
et al. 2015; Eardley et al. 2015) we ﬁnd considerable over-
lap in the overdensities or ﬂux ﬂuctuations assigned to
the diﬀerent cosmic web components (Fig. 3).
In the
RG = 4 h−1 Mpc DM map, we ﬁnd that the transitional
overdensity values at which voids, sheets, ﬁlaments, and
nodes successively dominate are at ∆dm ≈ [0.73, 1.1, 1.7].
The corresponding boundaries for the d25 ﬂux maps are
δF = [0.06,−0.024,−0.15] (recall that negative δF cor-
responds to higher overdensities). These ﬂux values can
be converted to an equivalent DM overdensity using the
conversion between the d25 ﬂux and smoothed DM over-
density presented in Lee et al. (2016):

∆dm ≈ 5.502 δ2

F − 3.681 δF + 0.947.

(4)

When we convert the void/sheet, sheet/ﬁlament and ﬁla-
ment/node boundary values from the ﬂux map with this
expression, we get ∆dm ≈ [0.75, 1.04, 1.62]. The tran-
sition between the cosmic web element in the ﬂux map
occur at the nearly the same equivalent overdensities as
in the DM maps. We ﬁnd a similar correspondence be-
tween the transitional values for the cosmic web in the
d40 map and density ﬁeld smoothed to RG = 6 h−1 Mpc.
Interestingly, tuning the free parameter in each map
(λth for the dark matter and λth,F for the ﬂux) to match
the void fraction in S15a produces essentially identical
volume fractions of the other cosmic web components
in both the DM and ﬂux maps (Table 1).
In both
the DM and ﬂux maps with RG = 4 h−1 Mpc, approx-
imately [19%, 49%, 28%, 4%] of the volume are occupied
by voids, sheets, ﬁlaments and nodes while the corre-
sponding fractions in the RG = 6 h−1 Mpc maps are
[18%, 46%, 31%, 5%].

By eye, there is generally a good match between the
cosmic web components identiﬁed in the tomographic
ﬂux maps vis-`a-vis that from the equivalently-smoothed
DM map. The voids and sheets appear to yield the best
agreement, in part because they are extended structures
that are more easily resolved by even relatively sparse
IGM tomographic surveys. The ﬁlaments, which occupy
a smaller volume fraction, are smaller-scale structures
and those recovered from the tomography do not always
have the same topology as in the underlying DM ﬁeld,
but nevertheless the overall match is good. The nodes
occupy small isolated patches within the volume, and
appear to be the worst-recovered of the cosmic web clas-

siﬁcations. However, in most cases the nodes in the ﬂux
maps can be associated with DM nodes in the same vicin-
ity, albeit with positional oﬀsets and diﬀerent sizes.

To further quantify the matching, we evaluate the vol-
ume overlap for each component recovered from the mock
tomographic maps and underlying DM ﬁeld. For the
voids, sheets, ﬁlaments and nodes in the d25 ﬂux map,
we ﬁnd overlaps of approximately [68%, 72%, 66%, 52%],
respectively, with those from the matched DM map.
The coarser d40 tomographic map also provides a good,
albeit slightly worse, cosmic web recovery: we ﬁnd
[60%, 67%, 64%, 50%] overlap with voids, sheets, ﬁla-
ments, and nodes, respectively, recovered from the un-
derlying DM. Another method of comparison (Eardley
et al. 2015) is to ask what fraction of the total volume is
classiﬁed to within [−1, 0, +1] eigenvalues? For our d25
map we ﬁnd these fractions to be [15%, 69%, 15%], with
only 1% of the volume misclassiﬁed by ±2 eigenvalues.
Given the level of ﬁnite sampling and pixel noise mod-
eled in the tomographic maps, we ﬁnd this level of over-
lap highly encouraging. For comparison, Eardley et al.
(2015) applied a similar deformation tensor-based cosmic
web classiﬁcation scheme on a mock-up of the GAMA
galaxy redshift survey at 0.04 < z < 0.26, and found that
[10%, 75%, 15%] of their map volume was classiﬁed to
within [−1, 0, +1] eigenvalues. This is remarkable since
it shows that Lyα forest tomographic surveys using ex-
isting or near-future instrumentation should be able to
classify the z ∼ 2.5 cosmic web to an accuracy nearly as
high as z ∼ 0.1 galaxy surveys targeting sub-luminous
galaxies at high number-densities.

4.1. Eﬀect of Finite Survey Geometries

So far, we have applied the deformation tensor anal-
ysis to maps covering the full L = 256 h−1 Mpc simu-
lation volume with periodic boundary conditions. This
is in contrast with real observational volumes, which are
obviously non-periodic, and which may be smaller. Since
the deformation tensor is a non-local function of the ﬂux
(or density) we expect the classiﬁcation to be aﬀected by
survey boundaries and to be degraded compared to this
ideal case.

We investigate the impact of ﬁnite survey boundaries
by analyzing sub-volumes from the d25 simulated map,
at scales comparable to upcoming observations. Since
our L = 256 h−1 Mpc box size is, coincidentally, roughly
equivalent to the line-of-sight distance probed by exist-
ing IGM tomography surveys7 we subsample only in the

(2016) spanned 260 h−1 Mpc along the line-of-sight between 2.2 <
z < 2.5.

years. Further in the future, massively-multiplexed spec-

cover areas of several square degrees, e.g. the Galaxy

for Subaru-PFS (Takada et al. 2014) will observe multi-
ple regions across the sky, each spanning 4− 5 square de-

grees — the (128 h−1 Mpc)2 map will approximate such
a wider survey geometry for each of these chunks. The
size of these transverse areas, relative to the full sim-
ulation box, are illustrated in the lower-right panels of
Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Purely by eye, one might expect an
aliasing eﬀect from the survey geometry of the smallest
(16 h−1 Mpc)2 area, which is not much larger than the
characteristic scales spanned by the cosmic web struc-
tures at the scales probed by IGM tomography.

To quantify this impression, for each subvolume we
embed the extracted tomographic ﬂux in the center of a
5123 super-grid with the same 1 h−1 Mpc cell size as be-
fore. Following Eardley et al. (2015), we pad the region
outside of the map by reﬂecting half of the data along
each edge. We carry out this process in all three dimen-
sions, since the 5123 super-grid was chosen to be large
enough to allow the reﬂective padding even along the

long z-dimension. Beyond the reﬂection regions, we pad
the super-grid with zeros. The deformation tensor evalu-
ation and eigenvalue analysis is carried out as described
previously, and using the same eigenvalue thresholds as
before. The input subvolume is then extracted from the
padded super-grid, and the cosmic web elements therein
compared with those in the corresponding regions of the
full periodic DM map.

The results are summarized in Fig. 4, which shows the
volume overlap fractions of the cosmic web components
recovered from the tomographic subvolumes, compared
with those from the DM ﬁeld. As expected, smaller
maps lead to a degraded recovery of the cosmic web:
within the (16 h−1 Mpc)2 sub-volume, the ﬁlaments and
nodes are recovered with only ≈ 45% and ≈ 26% vol-
ume overlap with the true DM map, while the voids
and sheets are recovered with < 60% volume overlap.
This is a clear degradation compared to the recovery
fraction of [72%, 66%, 52%] for the sheets, ﬁlaments and
nodes in the full periodic L = 256 h−1 Mpc ﬂux map.
By going to observed areas of order a square degree,
the volume overlap with the DM is improved signiﬁ-

cantly to ≈ [66%, 61%, 49%] for the sheets, ﬁlaments,
and nodes, respectively, in the (64 h−1 Mpc)2 map. How-
ever, the void recovery actually degrades slightly going
from (16 h−1 Mpc)2 to (64 h−1 Mpc)2 before improving
again with even larger areas. This is because the overall
void fraction is overestimated in the small-area recon-
structions, with ∼ 30% of the volume identiﬁed as voids
compared with 19% in the full map. The exaggerated
void fraction therefore artiﬁcially allows a better overlap
with the voids in the underlying DM map.

5. HALO ABUNDANCES IN THE COSMIC WEB
There is some evidence to suggest that the manner in
which halos form, and some of their properties, depend
upon their location within the cosmic web (e.g. Hahn
et al. 2007; Libeskind et al. 2012; Forero-Romero et al.
2014). In as much as galaxy properties are determined by
the formation history and properties of the dark matter
halos in which they reside, and their nearest neighbors
(Porter et al. 2008), we may expect to see a dependence
of galaxy properties on cosmic web location as well. It is
plausible, though by no means demonstrated, that galaxy

values at which diﬀerent components dominate. Note that negative δF ﬂux values correspond to larger overdensities, and also that all the

properties may depend on the larger scale (gaseous) en-
vironment in which the galaxy forms.

At lower redshifts, a major determinant of galaxy
properties appears to be halo mass (see, e.g., Abbas &
Sheth 2006; Skibba et al. 2006; Tinker et al. 2008; al-
though some properties depend upon formation history,
e.g. Reed et al. 2007; Yan et al. 2013; Hearin et al. 2015),
and it has been shown in simulations that the major de-
terminant of the halo mass function appears to be lo-
cal density (or the trace of our Hessian matrix; Forero-
Romero et al. 2014; Alonso et al. 2015). This is expected
in a theory based on Gaussian statistics within the linear
regime, where the halo mass function varies solely due to
the underlying density ﬁeld and there is no coupling to
tidal forces (Alonso et al. 2015).

Here we make a preliminary investigation of the rela-
tionship between the geometric cosmic web classiﬁcation
and local density using the tomographic ﬂux maps, and
the manner in which the halo mass function8 depends on

8 We defer a detailed examination of other halo properties to a
future publication, where we would also like to investigate gas ﬂows
and halo fueling using hydrodynamical, rather than dark matter-

cosmic web classiﬁcation, controlling for local density, at
z ∼ 2.5. We ﬁnd that environment and local density are
correlated, and at ﬁxed density there is little dependence
of halo multiplicity on environment even at these early
times.
We use a friends-of-friends halo catalog at z (cid:39) 2.5 for
our investigations. First, we deﬁne the regions in the
simulation volume corresponding to either the overden-
sity range or cosmic classiﬁcation, and then compute the
multiplicity function of the encompassed halos:

f (ln M ) dln M =

M
¯ρ

dn

dln M

dln M,

(5)

where M is the (FoF) halo mass, n is the number density,
and ¯ρ is the mean mass density deﬁned within the volume
of the overdensity or cosmic web cut.

In Figure 5, we show the multiplicity functions split
by both DM overdensity and reconstructed Lyα ﬂux in
the d25 map, in which the ranges were chosen to be
between the transitional values between diﬀerent cosmic

only, simulations.

8

Lee & White

We ﬁnd that within the observational uncertainties ex-
pected from the ∼ 1 deg2 CLAMATO survey (error bars
in left panels of Figs 5 and 6), the density-dependent halo
multiplicity functions deﬁned on the ﬂux maps are con-
sistent with those from the DM density. This indicates
that IGM tomography surveys will be enable unique in-
sights into galaxy evolution at z (cid:39) 2.5, allowing the
Lyα forest ﬂux to act as a proxy for environmental den-
sity (and hence halo mass, Haas et al. 2012). While it
would be extremely challenging to measure enough spec-
troscopic redshifts of coeval galaxies to directly compute
halo abundances, IGM tomographic maps will allow us
to identify regions with diﬀerent underlying halo abun-
dances. This information can then be related to observed
galaxy properties from even limited samples of coeval
galaxies.

We also evaluate the halo multiplicity as a function
of the geometric cosmic web classiﬁcation, the results of
which are shown in Fig. 6 for both the DM and ﬂux
maps at RG = 4 h−1 Mpc and RG = 6 h−1 Mpc. There
are also clear diﬀerences in the halo multiplicities seen
in the diﬀerent cosmic web components within a given
map, but at a somewhat lower level than those seen in
the overdensity cuts (Fig. 5). This reduced contrast is
primarily because the halo abundance depends primar-
ily on the overdensity environment rather than explic-
itly on the cosmic web classiﬁcation, therefore evaluat-
ing f (ln M ) within each cosmic web component actually
samples a relatively broad range of overdensities than
when sampling explicitly by overdensity (see Fig. 3).

By comparing halos that reside in the same overden-
sity environment but diﬀerent cosmic web classiﬁcations,
we can test for any explicit dependence on the geo-
metric cosmic web environment. In the DM map with
RG = 4 h−1 Mpc smoothing, we select halos that reside
in regions with 0.82 < ∆dm < 0.92. This is a range that
is dominated by sheets, but simultaneously includes the
low- and high-mass tails of ﬁlaments and voids, respec-
tively (c.f. top-left panel of Fig. 3). To remove any rela-
tive bias in the overdensity distribution within this range,
we match the halo counts to within bins of ∆dm = 0.005
for all the cosmic web components. Due to this require-
ment, we are limited to evaluating only a total of 10,000
halos for each component, resulting in somewhat noisy
multiplicity functions. We also carry out the same ex-
ercise for the d25 ﬂux maps by selecting halos found in
regions with 0.012 < δF < 0.036, which is approximately
equivalent to the aforementioned 0.82 < ∆dm < 0.92
range according to Eq. 4.

The resulting halo multiplicity functions are shown in
Fig. 7. While the curves are somewhat noisy, there is
no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in halo abundance as a func-
tion of cosmic web classiﬁcation when the density is
held ﬁxed, even when contrasting voids with ﬁlaments.
This is consistent with the low-redshift behavior found
by e.g. Alonso et al. (2015), who also found no explicit
cosmic web dependence on scales of several Mpc.

However, when considering halos within the cosmic
web deﬁned on the reconstructed Lyα ﬂux, we ﬁnd a
slight (several percent) tilt in the relative halo multiplic-
ity when going from voids to ﬁlaments. This is caused by
a slight bias in the ﬂux ﬁlament halos toward higher ∆dm
than would be expected from the mean ∆dm-δf relation-
ship (Eq. 4). This bias is possibly due to the diﬀerent

Figure 4. Volume overlap fractions of voids, sheets, ﬁlaments and
nodes in the z = 2.5 cosmic web recovered from subvolumes of the
d25 tomographic ﬂux map, compared with those in the underlying
full DM map with RG = 4 h−1 Mpc.
In each subvolume, the
subsampling is carried only in the transverse xy plane, while the
z-dimension spans the full 256 h−1 Mpc of the simulation box. The
recovery of the cosmic web is degraded in map areas signiﬁcantly
smaller than ∼ (60 h−1 Mpc)2, equivalent to approximately one
square degree at these redshifts.

web components (vertical-dashed lines in Fig. 3). As
expected, we see large diﬀerences in the halo multiplic-
ity: halos residing in low-density environments tend to
have lower halo masses, while high-density regions har-
bor relatively massive halos.
In other words, the lo-
cal density (“environment”) can act as a proxy for halo
mass, as has been studied using lower-z galaxy environ-
ment estimators (e.g., Haas et al. 2012). Interestingly,
the multiplicity functions measured in the DM density
maps smoothed by the two diﬀerent smoothing scales
(RG = 4 h−1 Mpc and RG = 6 h−1 Mpc) diﬀer by only
∼ 10%. This suggests that a cosmic web classiﬁcation
would be useful to deﬁne consistent overdensity thresh-
olds across diﬀerent surveys sampling various smoothing
scales, even if (as we shall see) there is little explicit de-
pendence of the halo abundance on the geometric cosmic
web.

It is also clear from Fig. 5 that in terms of diﬀerenti-
ating environments with diﬀerent halo abundances, the
reconstructed Lyα ﬂux is a good proxy for the DM over-
density at equivalent smoothing scales. This is even more
impressive since we did not select the δF ranges arbitrar-
ily: they were chosen from the cosmic web transitions
deﬁned self-consistently from the ﬂux maps (right pan-
els in Fig. 3) independently of any information about
the DM multiplicity functions — which were themselves
deﬁned via as the DM cosmic web transitional values.

We ﬁnd a slight bias in the multiplicity functions mea-
sured in the lowest-ﬂux volumes relative to the lowest
overdensity bin in the DM. To quantify this further in
terms of upcoming surveys, for the d25 ﬂux map we
evaluate the multiplicity functions within a CLAMATO-
like survey volume: we make (64 h−1 Mpc)2 cuts in the
transverse plane and plot the standard deviation of the
resulting halo abundances as the error bars in Fig. 5. We
did not estimate errors for the d40 box since the total
survey volume for a ∼ 20 deg2 Subaru-PFS survey would
be similar to our entire simulation volume.

this to subsequent papers.

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In our current cosmological model, all objects form and
evolve as part of the cosmic web of large-scale structure.
When smoothed on Mpc scales, the cosmic web may
be classiﬁed into voids, sheets, ﬁlaments and nodes and
as the web evolves material ﬂows out of voids, through
sheets and along ﬁlaments into nodes. It remains an area
of active investigation whether, and in what manner, the
location of cosmological objects within the web aﬀects
their evolution and properties.

The cosmic web has been studied at low redshift using
spectroscopic samples of galaxies with large number den-
sities, but maintaining Mpc resolution over cosmological
volumes with such surveys becomes progressively more
diﬃcult at higher redshift. Beyond z (cid:39) 2 a new tech-
nique can be applied for mapping large-scale structure

and the cosmic web: Lyα forest tomography. By study-
ing Lyα absorption in the spectra of distant QSOs and
galaxies with small transverse separations, it is possible
to map cosmologically representative volumes with Mpc-
scale ﬁdelity and thus classify regions within the cosmic
web.

We have found that in our simulations the cosmic web
classiﬁcation in Lyα forest ﬂux maps — reconstructed
from realistic mock data — is in excellent agreement with
that determined directly from the underlying dark mat-
ter for volumes and resolutions comparable to the ongo-
ing CLAMATO survey. This oﬀers a promising route,
with current facilities, to studying galaxies and AGN
within the context of the cosmic web during “cosmic
noon”, when we expect vigorous star-formation activity,
AGN activity and gas inﬂows (possibly along ﬁlaments).
limitation to classifying
structures within the cosmic web comes directly from the
non-local nature of its deﬁnition. For a survey which is
too small, boundary eﬀects dramatically aﬀect the accu-
racy of the classiﬁcation. Since structures in the cosmic

ﬁxed.

web span tens of Mpc, the survey must cover 1 deg2 in
order to return reliable classiﬁcations. Once a survey
reaches this size, however, the classiﬁcations are nearly
as reliable as those obtained from deep spectroscopic sur-
veys of the local Universe.

This paper establishes that a reliable cosmic web classi-
ﬁcation is possible with Lyα forest tomography on exist-
ing facilities with relatively modest investments of time.
We also made a preliminary investigation into halo prop-
erties as a function of the cosmic web, which showed
that the high-z multiplicity function of halos was largely
insensitive to where in the cosmic web a halo lay, de-
pending primarily on local density. This suggests that
only galaxy properties which depend on properties other
than halo mass (e.g. formation history, spin, etc.) are
likely to correlate with geometric environment even at
high z. In future work we will investigate the predictions
of models of galaxy and AGN formation, and gas ﬂows
in hydrodynamic simulations, for more detailed depen-
dence on geometric environment during this active era
in galaxy evolution. Nevertheless, we have shown that
the IGM tomographic ﬂux is an excellent proxy for the
scalar density environment at z ∼ 2.5, therefore the com-
bination of upcoming maps from the CLAMATO survey
with coeval galaxy samples will likely yield exciting new
results.
