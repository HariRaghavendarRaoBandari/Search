Introduction

Group classiﬁcation of diﬀerential equations consists in the speciﬁcation of their non-equivalent
classes which are characterized by non-equivalent symmetry groups. It is an important research
ﬁeld which has both fundamental and application values.

One of the most famous results in this ﬁeld is the group classiﬁcation of Schr¨odinger equa-
tions with arbitrary potentials, which was carried out as far back as in the seventieth of the
previous century in papers [1], [2], [3], [4]. In particular, it was shown in [1] and [2] that in
addition to the Galilei invariance, the free Schr¨odinger equation (SE) admits conformal transfor-
mations of independent variables provided the wave function is multiplied by a factor dependent
on these variables and transformation parameters. This discovery gave rise for many inspiring
physical theories such as the conformal quantum mechanics. The completed information about
possible symmetry groups of SE and the corresponding non-equivalent versions of these equa-
tions presented in [1], [2], [3], [4] is a cornerstone of modern quantum mechanics. Much less
popular results concerning the group classiﬁcation of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger and Ginsburg-
Landau equations can be found in papers [5] and [6], higher symmetries of non-stationary linear
and non-linear SE were discussed in [7], Lie symmetries of supersymmetric SE were studied in
[8] and [9]. Finally, symmetries of the free SE in the non-commutative plane are presented in
[10].

On the other hand, the group classiﬁcation of SE with position dependent mass (PDM)
continues to be an open problem, which is a rather curious fact taking into account the fun-
damental role played by such equations in various branches of modern physics. There is a
number of papers devoted to SE with various particular and sometimes exotic symmetries, see,
e.g., [11], [12], [13], [14]. But, at the best of our knowledge, even the standard symmetries
of these equations with respect to continuous transformation groups never where investigated
completely.

The attempt of a systematic study of symmetries of the PDM SE was undertaken in paper
[15] where all such (stationary) 3d equations with diﬀerent symmetry groups have been clas-
siﬁed. The number of non-equivalent equations appears to be rather extended and includes
18 classes. Seven of them are deﬁned up to arbitrary parameters while the remaining ones
include arbitrary functions. Rather surprisingly one of the considered equations is invariant
with respect to the 6-parameter Lie group locally isomorphic to the Lorentz group.

In the present paper we make a group classiﬁcation of time dependent PDM SE with 1+2
independent variables, which will be referred as 2d SE. This is not only the ﬁrst step to clas-
siﬁcation of equations with higher dimensions, but also an interesting self-consistent problem.
First, the planar systems are of particular interest in modern physics. Secondly, such equations
naturally appear as reduced versions of multidimensional systems written in partially separated
variables. One more origin of 2d SE with position dependent masses are quantized versions of
classical Hamiltonian systems deﬁned in Riemannian space in two dimensions, see, e.g., [13]
and references cited therein.

The classiﬁcation problem in 1+2 dimensional space is nothing like as simple as it looked.
In spite of the small number of dependent and independent variables, there are complications
connected with equivalence relations which are much more powerful than in 3d case. The
considered systems include two arbitrary elements, i.e., mass and potential terms, which make
the classiﬁcation problem rather nontrivial.

Since the ordinary SE with a constant mass appears in our analysis as a particular case , we

1

revised also the classiﬁcation results presented in [4]. We did not plane to verify them. However,
some systems appearing in our analysis are equivalent to systems with constant masses, and
willy-nilly we were supposed to recover some of such systems. To our astonishment, in this way
we discover a system missing in the list presented in [4], see Section 6 below.

2 Time dependent PDM Schr¨odinger equations

The subject of our analysis are PDM Schr¨odinger equations of the following generic form

Lψ ≡ (cid:18)i

∂

∂t − H(cid:19) ψ = 0

where H is the PDM Hamiltonian

H = mρpam−1−2ρpamρ + V.

(1)

(2)

Here pa = −i ∂
, m = m(x) and V = V (x) are the mass and potential depending on spatial
variables x = (x1, x2, ..., xn), and summation w.r.t. the repeating indices a is imposed over the
values a = 1, 2, ..., n. This summation convention was used in all the following text.

∂xa

In (2) we use the physically motivated representation mρpam−1−2ρpamρ for the kinetic energy
term, where ρ is the ambiguity parameter of the kinetic energy term [16], [17]. Mathematically,
it is possible represent Hamiltonian in the following forms equivalent to (2):

H = paf pa + ˜V

and

H = pf papapf + ˆV

where

f = m−1,

˜V = V + (ρ2 + 2ρ)

.

Hamiltonians (3) and (4) are simple equal to (2) but written in more compact forms con-
venient for investigation of their symmetries. Just representation (3) was used in [15] for
classiﬁcation of ﬁrst order integrals of motion for PDM Hamiltonias, while representation (4)
appears to be convenient for classiﬁcation of second order integrals of motion [18]. Notice that
all representations of Hamiltonians given above are formally self adjoint.

Finally, let us transform Hamiltonian (4) and solutions of equation (1) in the following

manner:

ψ → ˜ψ = f − 1

2 ψ, H → ˆH = f − 1

2 Hf

2 = f papa + ˆV .

Representation (7) was used in [18] for construction of exact solutions of the corresponding
eigenvalue problems.

In the present paper we restrict ourselves to group classiﬁcation of equations (1) with two
spatial variables. In addition, we will study Hamiltonians in the form (3). The classiﬁcation
results can be easily reformulated for systems with Hamiltonians represented in (2), (4) and
(7), since the relations between these representations are rather straightforward and given by
formulae (5), (6) and (7).

We will not consider systems with one spatial dimension, since using the Liouville trans-
formation they always can be reduced to systems with constant masses, see [18] for examples
and references. The ﬁrst steps of our analysis are valid for systems of arbitrary dimension n.
However, to complete the group classiﬁcation of systems with a dimension n ≥ 3 it is neces-
sary to know all non-equivalent continuous subgroups of the conformal group C(n) deﬁned in
n-dimensional Euclidean space. At the best of our knowledge such subgroups are described
only for n ≤ 3.

3 Determining equations for symmetries of systems (1)

with any dimension

Let us search for symmetries of equations (1) with respect to continuous groups of transforma-
tions. It can be done using the classical Lie algorithm created in 18th century, its contemporary
version can be found in monograph [21]. In application to the linear Schr¨odinger equation this
algorithm can be reduced to searching for the ﬁrst order diﬀerential operators of the following
form:

Q = ξ 0∂t + ξa∂a + ˜η ≡ ξ 0∂t +

(ξa∂a + ∂aξa) + iη,

independent variables, whose explicit form can be found from the following operator equation

In (8) ˜η = 1

a + iη,

2ξa

QL − LQ = αL

where α is one more unknown function of t and x.

(9)

Evaluating commutator in (9) and equating coeﬃcients for the same diﬀerentials we come

to the following system of the determining equations for unknowns ξ 0, ξa, η, f, ˆV and α:

˙ξ 0 = −α,

Considering various diﬀerential and algebraic consequences of (11)–(13) it is possible to

reduce this system to the following equivalent form (see Appendix 1):

(17)

The system (10), (14)-(17) is overdetermined but rather complicated.

It can hardly be
solved for arbitrary n if at all. In the following sections we present solutions of this system for
n = 2.

4 Reduction to the case n=2 and equivalence relations

The classiﬁcation problem in 1+2 dimensional space is rather speciﬁc. First, the number of
dependent and independent variables is relatively small, secondly, the equivalence relations
appear to be more powerful than in the cases of more extended carrier spaces.

Equation (14) for n = 2 is reduced to the Caushy-Rieman conditions for functions ξ 1 = u

and ξ 2 = v:

u1 = v2,

u2 = −v1.

The corresponding symmetries (8) can be rewritten as follows:

Q = ξ 0∂0 + u∂1 + v∂2 + u1 + iη.

The remaining equations (15)–(17) take the following form:

2f η1 + ˙u = 0,
2f η2 + ˙v = 0,
uf1 + vf2 − (α + 2u1)f = 0,
uV1 + vV2 + u11f1 + v22f2 = αV + ˙η.

(18)

(19)

(20)
(21)
(22)
(23)

Just system (10), (18), (20)–(23) together with deﬁnition (19) describes all possible gen-
erators of continuous symmetry groups and the corresponding position dependent masses and
potentials of equations (1), (3) for n = 2. We will classify equations (1), (3) with diﬀerent
symmetries up to equivalence relations deﬁned in the following.

Let us note that Hamiltonian (3) is form invariant with respect to the following transfor-

mation including simultaneous changes of dependent and independent variables:

x1 → ˜u(x1, x2),
ψ →

1
√R

ψ,

H →

x2 → ˜v(x1, x2),

H√R

1
√R

(24)

(25)

where ˜u and ˜v are arbitrary functions satisfying the Caushi-Rieman condition (18), and R =
2. Indeed, transformations (24) and (25) keep the generic form of the Hamiltonian but

1 + ˜u2

p˜u2

change functions f and V in (3).

In addition, equation (1) admits the scaling and shifts of the time variable:

t → νt + µ,

4

(26)

were ν 6= 0 and µ are arbitrary constants. Such transformations can be compensated by
multiplication of f and V by 1
ν .
It is possible to show that formulae (24), (25) and (26) give the most general continues
transformations which keep the generic form (3) of the Hamiltonian up to change of functions
f and V . The validity of this statement can be veriﬁed by a direct calculation. Notice that
just transformations of type (24) correspond to generic inﬁnitesimal operator (19) where u and
v are arbitrary functions satisfying (18). And just conditions (18) are necessary and suﬃcient
to keep the shape of the second derivative term in (3).

We will say two equations of type (1), (3) be equivalent provided they can be connected via

transformations (24)–(26).

These equivalence relations are rather powerful. In particular, starting with Hamiltonian

(3) with f = 1 and making changes (24) and (25) we obtain:

H = ˜pa ˜f ˜pa + ˜V

where

˜p1 = −i
˜f = ˜u2

˜V = V (x1(˜u, ˜v), x2(˜u, ˜v)) ,

(27)

(28)

Formulae (27) and (28) give the inﬁnite set PDM Hamiltonians which are equivalent to
Hamiltonians with constant masses. To verify whether a given Hamiltonian (3) be equivalent
to the Hamiltonian with a constant mass we are not supposed to search for a possibility to
represent it in form (27), but can use a more convenient criteria presented in the following
statement.

Proposition. Hamiltonian (3) is equivalent to a Hamiltonian with a constant mass iﬀ the

corresponding function f solves the following equation:

(log f )nn = 0

or, which is the same,

f fnn = fmfm.

(29)

(30)

Proof. The generic form of Hamiltonian (3) equivalent to a constant mass Hamiltonian
is given by equations (27)–(28). Function ˜f by construction satisﬁes condition (30) thus this
condition is necessary.

Let equation (30) be satisﬁed, then representing f in the form

f = c exp(ω)

(31)

we conclude that function ω should solve the 2d Laplace equation. It means that ω = F (x1 +
ix2) + G(x1 − ix2). Moreover, since f by deﬁnition is real, G should be nothing but the complex
conjugated function F . It means that f = exp(F )(exp(F ))†, i.e., f is a squared module of a
complex analytical function U = exp(F ). Any such function can be represented as U = ˜u1 + i˜v1
with some ˜u and ˜v satisfying the Caushi-Rieman condition. Thus the Hamiltonian with such
f is equivalent to a Hamiltonian with constant mass. (cid:4)

5

In particular, if f depends only on one of variables, say, f = F (x1), the corresponding
Hamiltonian is equivalent to Hamiltonian with a constant mass iﬀ F = a exp(bx1) with some
constants a and b. One more important case: let f = F (x2
2), then it is possible to reduce it
to a constant inverse mass iﬀ F is a power function. Finally, let the inverse mass be a product
of functions depending on diﬀerent variables, i.e., f = F (x1)G(x2). Then it can be reduced to
a constant iﬀ F (x1) = C1 exp(νx2

1 + x2

The presented equivalence criteria will be multiple used in the following.

5 Classiﬁcation results

We reduce the classiﬁcation of symmetries of 2d quantum mechanical systems with position
dependent masses to solution of the determining equations (20)–(23) with functions u and v
satisfying conditions (18). Using equivalence relations (24), (25) we can simplify the deter-
mining equations to the case u = 0 and v = 1, see Appendix 2. Such system of equations is
easy solvable. Its general solution gives us all non-equivalent Hamiltonians (3) such that the
corresponding equations (1) admit a one parametric Lie group of symmetry.

A more sophisticated problem is to classify systems admitting more extended symmetries.
To do it we are supposed additionally to solve determining equations of generic form (20)–(23)
which, however, include the restricted mass and potential terms found in the previous step.

Here we present the completed list of PDM Hamiltonians together with admitted symme-

tries, while the calculation details can be found in the Appendix:

H = paf (r)pa + V (r),

2. In addition, f (r), F (ϕ), ˆV (r) and ˆV (ϕ) are arbitrary

Equations (32)–(38) present Hamiltonians with diﬀerent symmetries, deﬁned up to equiva-
lence relations (24), (25) and (26). All presented systems are invariant w.r.t. shifts of the time
variable. The generator of these transformations is P0 = i ∂
∂t .

Let us note that for F (ϕ) = exp(νϕ) and ˆV (ϕ) = µ exp(νϕ) the system (35) admits the ad-
ditional symmetry Q = J +2νtP0. In addition, if in equations (36) function f (r) is proportional
to r2, the corresponding system admits the additional integral of motion D0 = x1p1 + x2p2 − i.
We do not specify these cases in the list (32)–(38) since they are equivalent to systems with
constant masses.

Operators Q1, Q2, ..., Q5 given in formulae (32)–(34) commute with Hamiltonians and so

are integrals of motion. In addition, they satisfy the following commutation relations:

[Q1, Q2] = iQ3,

[Q1, Q3] = −iQ2,

[Q2, Q3] = iQ1

(39)

and

[Q1, Q4] = iQ5,

[Q4, Q5] = −iQ1
which specify algebras so(3) and so(1, 2) correspondingly.

[Q1, Q5] = −iQ4,

The other symmetries which are given by equations (35)–(38) are time dependent and do

not commute with Hamiltonians but satisfy the following relations:

[Q6, H] = 2iH,
[Q7, H] = −νI,
[Q8, H] = 0,

[Q7, I] = [H, I] = 0,

[Q9, H] = iαH,

[Q9, Q8] = iQ8,

[Q10, H] = −iνI,
[Q10, I] = [Q11, I] = [H, I] = 0

[Q11, H] = iH,

[Q10, Q11] = iνQ10,

(40)
(41)
(42)

(43)

where I is the unit operator.

Commutation relations (41) specify the Heizenberg algebra. In the case (43) we have the Lie
algebra of the centrally extended Galilei group in 1d space. Relations (40) and (42) characterize
the two and three dimensional solvable Lie algebras.

6 New symmetry for systems with constant mass

All systems given by formulae (32)–(38) essentially diﬀer from the systems with constant masses
since the related functions f do not satisfy conditions (30) and so cannot be reduced to constants
via transformations (24), (25). However, if we suppose that arbitrary functions f present in
(32) and (36) satisfy this condition and function F (ϕ) in (35) is constant, we can transform
the corresponding systems to constant mass ones.

7

Making this action with Hamiltonians (32) and (35) we come to well known systems classiﬁed
in paper [4]. Rather surprising, it is not the case for Hamiltonian (36). Setting f = 1 we obtain
the following Hamiltonian:

H = papa + ν arctan(cid:18)x2

x1(cid:19) + V (r)

(44)

which, in additional to the obvious invariance with respect to shifts of the time variable, admits
one more symmetry whose generator is

Q = x1p2 − x2p1 − νt.

(45)

Hamiltonian (44) is missing in the classiﬁcation results presented in paper [4]. Thus our
analysis of symmetries of PDM systems helped to make a small correction to this classical
paper.

For completeness let us present ﬁnite group transformation generated by operator (45):

x1 → x1 cos(θ) + x2 sin(θ),
x2 → x2 cos(θ) − x1 sin(θ),
ψ → exp(−iνθt)ψ

(46)

Invariance of equation (1) with Hamiltonian (44) and more
where θ is a real parameter.
general Hamiltonian (36) with respect to transformations (46) can be easily veriﬁed by the
direct calculation.

7 Exactly solvable system

Here we consider in more detail the system whose Hamiltonian is given by equation (33). This
system admits three integrals of motion two of which, say Q1 and Q2, are independent. This
number of independent integrals of motion is maximal for 2d Hamiltonians and characterizes
so called maximally superintegrable systems.

Let us consider the eigenvalue problem for Hamiltonian (33)

˜Hψ = −(∂a(1 + r2)2∂a + 4r2)ψ = Eψ,

(47)

where functions ψ are supposed to be square integrable and vanishing at r = 0.

Eigenvalues E can be found algebraically. Indeed, integrals of motion commute with H and
satisfy relations (39) and so form a basis of algebra so(3). Casimir operator C of this algebra
is equal to Q2

2, or, using realization (33),

1 + Q2

2 + Q2

C = Q2

1 + Q2

2 + Q2

3 ≡

4

(H − 4).

(48)

Let operators Q1, Q2 and Q3 realize an irreducible representation of algebra so(3) then, in
accordance with the Shurr lemma, the Casimir operator should be proportional to the unit
one. In addition, eigenvalues c of C are [20]

c = s(s + 1)

(49)

8

where s are integers or half integers.

Combining (48) and (49) we ﬁnd the admissible eigenvalues of Hamiltonian in the following

form:

E = n2 + 3,

n = 2s + 1 = 1, 2, 3, ...

(50)

Let us ﬁnd eigenvalues (50) and the corresponding eigenfunctions in a more usual way. In-
, and expanding

Let us note that it is reasonable to restrict ourselves to solutions with positive values of
parameter k. Then solutions for negative k can be found by transforming x1 → x1, x2 → −x2,
and

ψ(x1, x2) → ψ(x1, −x2), φk(r) → φ−k(r).

Square integrable solutions of equation (52) with k ≥ 0 are:

8 Discussion

We classify all non-equivalent planar QM systems with position dependent masses, which admit
non-trivial Lie symmetries. In other words we describe all such symmetries which are admissible
by PDM quantum mechanical systems. In this way we extend the classical results [1], [2], [3]
and [4] which were restricted to the constant mass systems. Moreover, we discover a system
missing in the Boyer classiﬁcation results [4], see Section 6. Let us note that there are 3d
analogues of system (44) which also are not presented in [4].

The systems which admit time independent integrals of motion commuting with Hamilto-
nian are given in equations (32), (33) and (34). The list such 2d PDM systems is rather short
and includes only three representatives one of which, namely (32), includes two arbitrary func-
tions . This result is in a good accordance with Ovsiannikov’s classiﬁcation of generic linear
partial diﬀerential equations of second order with two independent variables [19].

The systems whose Hamiltonians are speciﬁed in (33) and (34) are maximally superinte-
grable since any of them admits two independent integrals of motion. This property makes
these systems exactly solvable. The solutions of one of them are presented in Section 7.

9

Let us note that potentials present in Hamiltonians (33) and (34) does not include coupling
constants. It means that the corresponding systems can be treated as purely kinetic ones. Such
interpretation can be conﬁrmed by transformation of these Hamiltonians to the representation
(4) where potential ˆV appears to be trivial. In other words, in fact we deal with Hamiltonians
(2) with zero potentials, the ambiguity parameter ρ = 1/2 and masses m = 1

r2±1.

We remind that in the 3d case there exist much more (namely, eighteen) non-equivalent
systems admitting ﬁrst order integrals of motion [15]. The essential decreasing of the number
of the non-equivalent systems in the 2d case is caused by the more strong equivalence relations
(24) which are deﬁned up to an arbitrary analytic function. For three dimensional systems such
relations are deﬁned by transformations belonging to the 3d conformal group C(3) [15].

In the present paper we restrict ourselves to group classiﬁcation of 2d systems which are not
equivalent to systems with constant masses. The classiﬁcation results for systems with constant
masses were presented in [4], but they should be added by system discussed in Section 6.

Let us note that the results of our analysis present in Sections 2 and 3 are valid for systems
with an arbitrary number of spatial variables. In particular, they can be used to classify Lie
symmetries of 3d systems with position dependent masses. The list of 3d PDM systems with
diﬀerent symmetries is much more extended then one presented in Section 6 and includes tens
of representatives. The work at this list is in progress.

It would be interesting to extend our analysis to the case of higher order integrals of motion.
The ﬁrst step in this direction was done in paper [18] were the 3d systems were classiﬁed which,
in addition to their rotational invariance, admit second order integrals of motion.

Simpliﬁcation of determining equations

Here we prove the equivalence of systems (11)–(13) and (14)–(17).

this subsystem is an algebraic consequence of (11) and wise versa.

The subsystem (14), (15) is nothing but the traceless part and the trace of tensor F ab. Thus
Let us show that equation (12) can be reduced to (16). To this eﬀect we diﬀerentiate (15)
with respect to xa and (14) with respect to xb with summing up over the repeating index b. As
a result we obtain the following diﬀerential consequences:

2

n (cid:0)faξi

i + f ξi

ia(cid:1) = 0

and

ξi
afi + ξifia − αfa −

2 − n
n

ab − ξa
ξb

bb = 0.

(A1)

(A2)

Then we multiply all terms in (14) by fb and make summation over index b. That gives the

following algebraic consequence:

2
n

ξi
ifa − ξa

b fb − ξb

afb = 0.

(A3)

The sum of (12), (A1), (A2) and (A3) is nothing but equation (16). Then using (16) we

can reduce (13) to equation (17).

A.2 Symmetries independent on t

Let us prove that formulae (32)–(34) present the completed list of non-equivalent Hamiltonians
admitting ﬁrst order integrals of motion. For this purpose we consider the important subclass
of symmetry operators (8) corresponding to ξ 0 = α = 0 and time independent functions ξa and
η. In this case our classiﬁcation problem is reduced to ﬁnding all nonequivalent integrals of
motion of the following form:
˜Q = up1 + vp2 − iu1 + η,

(A4)

which commute with Hamiltonian (3).

The related equations (10) turn into identities, whilst the system (20)–(23) is reduced to

the following equations:

ηa = 0,
uf1 + vf2 = 2u1f,
uV1 + vV2 + u11f1 + v22f2 = 0.

(A5)
(A6)
(A7)

In accordance with (A5) η should be a constant. The corresponding term in (A4) represents

the evident constant integral of motion. We will not consider such integrals and set η = 0.

Let Hamiltonian (3) commutes with ﬁrst order diﬀerential operator (A4). Applying the
transformation of generic form (24) we can reduce (A4) to the shift generator (see Appendix
B)

˜Q → ˜Q′ = −i

∂
∂ ˜x2

.

The corresponding transformed Hamiltonian (27) should commute with (A8). Thus

˜f = ˜f (˜x1),

˜V = ˜V (˜x1),

(A8)

(A9)

i.e., both ˜f and ˜V F (Q) are arbitrary functions of ˜x1.

Let Hamiltonian (27), (A9) admits one more ﬁrst order integral of motion. Its generic form

can be obtained from (A4) by changing ua → ˜ua and setting η = 0:

ˆQ = u˜p1 + v ˜p2 − iu1

(A10)

where u and v are functions of ˜x1 and ˜x2 satisfying relations (18) and (A6), (A7) together with
functions (A9). The latter two relations take the following forms:

u ˜f1 = 2u1 ˜f ,
u ˜V1 + u11 ˜f1 = 0.

Integrating (A11) with respect to x1 we obtain:

u2 = ϕ(˜x2) ˜f (˜x1)

(A11)

(A12)

(A13)

where ϕ(˜x2) is a function of ˜x2. Thus u should be a product of functions dependent on ˜x1 and
˜x2:

u = g(˜x1)h(˜x2).

(A14)

11

In accordance with (18) u should satisfy the equation u11 + u22 = 0, i.e., g11h + gh22 = 0.

Separating variables, we come to the following conditions for g and h:

g11
g

h22
h

= −

= λ

where λ is a constant.

(A15)

There are three qualitatively diﬀerent solutions for equations (A15) corresponding to the

following versions of λ:

λ = 0,

λ = ω2 > 0,

λ = −ν 2 < 0.

In the ﬁrst case equations (A15) are solved by the following functions

g = a˜x1 + b,

h = c˜x2 + d

(A16)

(A17)

where a, b, c and d are integration constants. In accordance with (A12) the corresponding
potential ˜V is constant.

Up to simultaneous shifts and scalings of independent variables ˜x1 and ˜x1 (such transfor-
mations keep the general form of Hamiltonian (27)), functions f and ˜V satisfying equations
(A11) and (A12) can be chosen in the form

f = ˜x2
1,

˜V = Const.

Let λ = ω2 > 0, then equations (A15) are solved by the following functions:

g = a sin(ω ˜x1) + b cos(ω ˜x1),

h = c sinh(ω ˜x2) + d cosh(ω ˜x2).

(A18)

(A19)

Since symmetry operator (A10) is deﬁned up to a multiplication constant, arbitrary con-
stants a and b can be reduced to the form a = cos(C), b = sin(C) with some constant C.
Then

g = cos(ω ˜x1 − C) ≡ cos z1.

(A20)

On the other hand both constants a and b in (A19) are essential, and h cannot be reduced to
a form with one constant.

The corresponding functions f and ˜V are obtained solving equations (A11) and (A12):

f = sin2(z1),

V = f + Const.

(A21)

These solutions generate Hamiltonians (27) which commute with the following operators:

Q1 =

∂
∂z2

, Q2 = sin(z1) cosh(z2)

∂
∂z1

+ cos(z1) sinh(z2)

∂
∂z2

+ cos(z1) cosh(z2),

(A22)

Q3 = sin(z1) sinh(z2)∂z1 + cos(z1) cosh(z2)∂z2 + cos(z1) cosh(z2)

where we denote ωx2 = z2.

Analogously, considering solutions of (A15) corresponding to λ = −ν 2 we obtain the follow-

ing solutions for functions g(x1) and h(x2):

g = cosh(z1),

h = a cos(z2) + b sin(z2)

(A23)

12

and

g = sinh(z1),

h = a cos(z2) + b sin(z2)

(A24)

where z1 = ν ˜x1 and z2 = ν ˜x2. The corresponding solutions of equations (A11), (A12) are

˜f = cosh2(z1),

˜V = −f

and

˜f = sinh2(z1),

˜V = −f

respectively.

(A25)

(A26)

Notice that all Hamiltonians with the inverse masses given by equations (A21), (A26) and
(A18) are equivalent. This equivalence is almost evident. Indeed, writing Hamiltonian (27),
(A18) in circular variables ˜x1 = z2 sin(z1), ˜x2 = z2 sin(z1), we immediately reduce it to the
Hamiltonian with inverse mass and potential given by equation (A26). On the other hand,
introducing in (27), (A18) hyperbolical variables ˜x1 = z2 sinh(z1), ˜x2 = z2 sinh(z1) we obtain
Hamiltonian (27) with constituents (A21).

Thus there are three non-equivalent Hamiltonians (27) which admit diﬀerent time inde-
pendent constants of motion, which correspond to the inverse masses and potentials given
by equations (A9), (A25) and (A26). Just these Hamiltonians are represented in equations
(32)–(34) where we introduce Cartesian variables x1 = log(z1) cos(z2) and x2 = log(z1) sin(z2).

A.3 Time dependent symmetries

Consider now determining equations (20)–(23) for the case when at least one of functions α
and ξ 0 is nontrivial and functions η, u and v can depend on time variable t.

To specify the admissible dependence on t we make the following steps. Using conditions
(18) which should be valid also for ˙u and ˙v, and supposing ˙u and ˙v to be non-trivial we obtain
the following evident diﬀerential consequences of (20) and (21):

˙u ˆf2 − ˙v ˆf1 − 2 ˙u2 = 0,
˙u ˆf1 + ˙v ˆf2 − 2 ˙u1 + α = 0

where ˆfa = fa
f .

(A27)

(A28)

Diﬀerentiating equation (A27) with respect to x2, equation (A28) with respect to x1 and

summing up the resulting expressions we obtain:

˙u ˆfnn = 0,

or

˙u(log f )nn = 0.

(A29)

It follows from (A29) that if u and v are time dependent, then the Hamiltonian admitting the
corresponding symmetry should be equivalent to a constant mass one, see Proposition proved
in Section 4.1. Thus to classify essentially PDM systems it is suﬃcient to restrict ourselves to
equations (20)–(23) with u and v independent on t. In this case equations (20) and (21) are
reduced to the following conditions:

u = u(x1, x2),

v = v(x1, x2),

η = η(t),

(A30)

13

and the classiﬁcation problem is reduced to solving equation (22) for f and then equation (23)
for V .

Like in previous subsection we can reduce the terms with spatial derivatives in (A4) to the

shift generator. Then generator Q takes the following form:

Q = iξ 0 ∂
∂t

+ p2 + η.

In other words we start with u = 0 and v = 1 which reduce equations (22) and (23) to the
following forms:

∂f
∂x2

= αf,

∂V
∂x2

= αV + ˙η.

(A31)

In order to this system be consistent, α should be a constant and η be a linear function of
t or a constant, i.e., η = νt + µ, since f and V are time independent. Then integrating (A31)
we obtain:

f = exp(αx2) ˜f (x1),

V = exp(αx2) ˆV (x1) −

or

f = ˜f (x1),

V = µx2 + ˆV (x1), α = 0.

, α 6= 0

(A32)

(A33)

ν
α

Let our system admits one more symmetry of generic form (19). The corresponding functions

u and v should satisfy condition (22) together with functions f speciﬁed in (A32) or (A33).

Substituting f (A32) into equation (22) we obtain:

u ˜f1 + αv ˜f = ( ˜α + 2u1) ˜f .

(A34)
Since u, v, ˜f and α are time independent, new element ˜α corresponding to the second symme-
try should be time independent too. Moreover, considering systems admitting two symmetries,
we can a priory reduce one of parameters, α or ˜α, to zero, which can be achieved by coming
to linear combinations of these symmetries. We will set α = 0, i.e., restrict ourselves to the
version represented in (A33). The corresponding equations (A34) and (23) are:

u ˜f1 = ( ˜α + 2u1) ˜f ,
u ˆV1 + µv + u11 ˜f1 = ˜α(µx2 + ˆV ) + ˙η.

(A35)

(A36)

Diﬀerentiating (A35) with respect to x2 we obtain the following condition:

u2 ˜f1 = 2u12 ˜f .

(A37)
Since ˜f does not depend on x2, it follows from (A37) that u should have the following form:

u = Φ(x1)Ψ(x2) + Ω(x1)

(A38)

with Φ(x1), Ψ(x2) and Ω(x1) being functions of arguments given in the brackets. Thus u2 = ΦΨ2
is a product of functions of diﬀerent arguments.

Since u2 should satisfy the 2d Laplace equation, Φ11Ψ2 + ΦΨ222 = 0, and so

Φ11
Φ

Ψ111
Ψ1

= −

= λ

(A39)

where λ is a parameter satisfying one of conditions (A16). Considering these conditions conse-
quently it is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd the corresponding functions u and then functions f satisfying
(A28) and (A38). As a result we obtain Hamiltonians and the corresponding symmetries pre-
sented in equations (35)–(38).

A.4 Reduction of symmetry operator

Let us consider the generic ﬁrst order integral of motion (A4) and show a simple way to reduce
it to the shift generator. The very possibility of such reduction is an element of common
knowledge, see, e.g., [21]. However, we are restricted to using of special changes of variables
(24) which generates some speciﬁcities of this standard procedure which are presented here.

To transform a given operator Q (A4) to the simple form (A8) it is necessary to change
independent variables x1 and x2 to new variables ˜x1 = ϕ1(x1, x2) and ˜x2 = ϕ(x1, x2), satisfying
the following system of partial diﬀerential equations:

Q˜x1 = 0, Q˜x2 = 1.

(A40)

However, using the fact that in our case functions ˜x1 and ˜x2 satisfy also Caushi-Riemann
conditions, it is possible to reduce (A40) to the following form:

∂ ˜x1
∂x1

=

∂ ˜x2
∂x2

u

u2 + v2 ,

= −

∂ ˜x1
∂x2

∂ ˜x2
∂x1

= −

v

u2 + v2 .

= −

(A41)

For given functions u and v the system (A41) is easily integrable. Any its (even particular)
solution presents us new variables ˜x1 and ˜x2 which which can be used to reduce the given
operator (A4) to the simple form given by equation (A8).
