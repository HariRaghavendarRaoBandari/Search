Center of the quantum aﬃne vertex algebra in type A

Naihuan Jing, Slaven Koˇzi´c, Alexander Molev and Fan Yang

Abstract

We consider the quantum vertex algebra associated with the double Yangian in
type A as deﬁned by Etingof and Kazhdan. We show that its center is a commutative
associative algebra and construct algebraically independent families of topological
generators of the center at the critical level.

Introduction

Let g be a simple Lie algebra over C and letbg be the corresponding aﬃne Kac–Moody al-
gebra. The vacuum module Vκ(g) at the level κ ∈ C overbg has a vertex algebra structure;

see, e.g., books by E. Frenkel and D. Ben-Zvi [12], I. Frenkel, J. Lepowsky and A. Meur-
man [13] and V. Kac [18]. The center of any vertex algebra is a commutative associative
algebra. Unless the level κ is critical, the center of the aﬃne vertex algebra Vκ(g) is triv-
ial (coincides with C). By a theorem of B. Feigin and E. Frenkel [7], the center at the

E. Frenkel [11, Ch. 4] for a detailed exposition.

critical level z(bg) is an algebra of polynomials in inﬁnitely many variables. Moreover, the
algebra z(bg) is canonically isomorphic to the algebra of functions on a space of opers; see
Explicit formulas for generators of the Feigin–Frenkel center z(bg) were given in [2] and

[3] for type A (see also [24]), in [22] for types B, C and D; and in [25] for type G2. Due
to general results of [8], [9] and [28], these formulas lead to explicit constructions of com-
mutative subalgebras of the universal enveloping algebra U(g) and to explicit higher order
Hamiltonians and their eigenvalues on the Bethe vectors in the Gaudin model associated
with g; see also [14], [23].

A general deﬁnition of quantum vertex algebra was given by P. Etingof and D. Kazh-
dan [6]. In accordance with [6], a quantum aﬃne vertex algebra can be associated with
a rational, trigonometric or elliptic R-matrix. In particular, a suitably normalized Yang
R-matrix gives rise to a quantum vertex algebra structure on the vacuum module Vc(glN )
at the level c ∈ C over the double Yangian DY(glN ) of type A.

In this paper we introduce the center z(V ) of an arbitrary quantum vertex algebra V and
describe its general properties. We show that the center is an S-commutative associative
algebra; see (3.27) for the deﬁnition. In general, it need not be commutative. Our main

focus will be on the center z(cid:0)Vc(glN )(cid:1) of the quantum aﬃne vertex algebra Vc(glN ). The

vacuum module is isomorphic to the dual Yangian Y+(glN ), as a vector space, and we
prove that the center can be identiﬁed with a commutative subalgebra of Y+(glN ). This
subalgebra is invariant under a derivation D, the translation operator, arising from the
quantum vertex algebra structure on the vacuum module.

We show that the center at the critical level c = −N possesses large families of alge-
braically independent topological generators so that a quantum analogue of the Feigin–
Frenkel theorem holds. Moreover, unlike the center of the aﬃne vertex algebra V−N (glN ),
it turns out to be possible to produce such families parameterized by arbitrary partitions
with at most N parts. The construction depends of the fusion procedure originated in the
work of A. Jucys [17] for the symmetric group providing factorized R-matrix formulas for
all primitive idempotents. These families thus generalize to the context of quantum vertex
algebras the quantum immanants of A. Okounkov [27] which form a basis of the center of
the universal enveloping algebra U(glN ).

By taking a classical limit we recover explicit generators of the center of the aﬃne
vertex algebra V−N (glN ); cf. [2], [3] and [29]. In principle, this approach is also applicable

to construct generators of the Feigin–Frenkel center z(bg) for an arbitrary simple Lie algebra

g. A required ingredient is a fusion procedure providing R-matrix formulas for idempotents
in appropriate centralizer algebras. This is already in place for the types B, C and D so
that the construction of [22] can be reproduced in this way.

that the center z(cid:0)Vc(glN )(cid:1) is commutative.

We also give a construction of central elements of a completed double Yangian at the
critical level prompted by the quantum vertex algebra structure. They are used to show
If the level is not critical, then the center
is trivial in the sense that its generators are elements associated with the center of the
Lie algebra glN . They are found as the coeﬃcients of the quantum determinant of the
generator matrix of the dual Yangian.

Our arguments are based on explicit constructions of elements of the center of the
quantum aﬃne vertex algebra and rely on the R-matrix calculations used in [10] to produce
explicit Sugawara operators for the quantum aﬃne algebra in type A at the critical level.

Technology in Guangzhou. This work was ﬁnalized during the third author’s visit to the

2 Vacuum module for the double Yangian

We recall and reproduce some basic properties of the double Yangian for glN . Our def-
initions follow Etingof and Kazhdan [5], [6] and Iohara [16], where a centrally extended
double Yangian over the ring C[[h]] was considered. To simplify our formulas, we ﬁrst
deﬁne this algebra over C (formally putting h = −1 in the notation of [16]), although this
will require a certain completion; cf. Nazarov [26]. We will return to the closely related
deﬁnition of the double Yangian over C[[h]] to study the associated structure of quantum
vertex algebra in Sec. 4.

2.1 Yangian and dual Yangian for glN
The Yangian Y(glN ) is the associative algebra with generators t(r)
and r = 1, 2, . . . and the deﬁning relations

ij , where 1 6 i, j 6 N

[t(r)

(2.1)

where t(0)

ij = δij. In terms of the formal series

tij(u) = δij +

∞Xr=1

t(r)
ij u−r ∈ Y(glN )[[u−1]]

the deﬁning relations can be written as

(u − v) [tij(u), tkl(v)] = tkj(u) til(v) − tkj(v) til(u).

(2.2)

They admit the following matrix form. Consider the Yang R-matrix R(u), which is a
rational function in a complex parameter u with values in the tensor product algebra
End C N ⊗ End C N deﬁned by

R(u) = 1 − P u−1,

(2.3)

where P is the permutation operator in C N ⊗ C N . Then (2.1) is equivalent to the RTT
relation

where

R(u − v) T1(u) T2(v) = T2(v) T1(u) R(u − v),

T (u) =

NXi,j=1

eij ⊗ tij(u) ∈ End C N ⊗ Y(glN )[[u−1]]

(2.4)

(2.5)

and the eij are the matrix units. We use a subscript to indicate a copy of the matrix of
the form (2.5) in the multiple tensor product algebra

so that

Ta(u) =

NXi,j=1

1⊗(a−1) ⊗ eij ⊗ 1⊗(m−a) ⊗ tij(u).

(2.7)

We take m = 2 for the deﬁning relations (2.4).

This notation for elements of algebras of the form (2.6) will be extended as follows. For

an element

C =

NXi,j,r,s=1

cijrs eij ⊗ ers ∈ End C N ⊗ End C N ,

and any two indices a, b ∈ {1, . . . , m} such that a 6= b, we denote by Ca b the element of
the algebra (End C N )⊗m with m > 2 given by

Ca b =

NXi,j,r,s=1

cijrs (eij)a (ers)b,

(eij)a = 1⊗(a−1) ⊗ eij ⊗ 1⊗(m−a).

(2.8)

We regard the matrix transposition as the linear map

t : End C N → End C N ,

eij 7→ eji.

For any a ∈ {1, . . . , m} we will denote by ta the corresponding partial transposition on the
algebra (2.6) which acts as t on the a-th copy of End C N and as the identity map on all
the other tensor factors.

The algebra Y(glN ) possesses a natural ascending ﬁltration deﬁned by deg t(r)

ij = r − 1
for all r > 1. Denote by gr Y(glN ) the associated graded algebra. We have the isomorphism
in the (r − 1)-th component

gr Y(glN ) ∼= U(cid:0)glN [t](cid:1). The image ¯t (r)
of the graded algebra gr Y(glN ) corresponds to the element Eij[r − 1] of U(cid:0)glN [t](cid:1), where

the Eij are the standard basis elements of glN and we use the notation X[r] = X tr for
X ∈ glN and any r ∈ Z.

The image ¯t (−r)

of the generator t(−r)

in the (−r)-th component of the graded algebra

gr Y+(glN ) corresponds to the element Eij[−r] of U(cid:0)t−1glN [t−1](cid:1). The isomorphism relies

on the Poincar´e–Birkhoﬀ–Witt theorem for Y+(glN ) which can be proved in a way similar
to the Yangian; cf. [21, Ch. 1] and references therein. We will give a more general proof
below in the context of the double Yangian which would imply (2.14); see Corollary 2.3.
For any nonzero a ∈ C the mapping

eva : T +(u) 7→ 1 + E (u − a)−1,

(2.15)

deﬁnes the evaluation homomorphism Y+(glN ) → U(glN ). We assume an expansion into
a power series in u so that in terms of generators it takes the form eva : t (−r)
7→ Eij a−r.

2.2 Double Yangian for glN

The double Yangian DY(glN ) for glN is deﬁned as the associative algebra generated by
the central element C and elements t(r)
, where 1 6 i, j 6 N and r = 1, 2, . . . ,
subject to the deﬁning relations written in terms of the generator matrices (2.5) and (2.13)
as follows; see [5], [6] and [16]. They are given by (2.4), (2.12) together with the relation

ij and t(−r)

2 (v) = T +

where

and

R(u) = g(u) R(u) = g(u)(cid:0)1 − P u−1(cid:1)

g(u) = 1 +

∞Xi=1

gi u−i,

gi ∈ C,

(2.17)

(2.18)

is a formal power series in u−1 whose coeﬃcients are uniquely determined by the relation

g(u + N) = g(u) (1 − u−2).

(2.19)

Its ﬁrst few terms are

g(u) = 1 +

1
N

u−1 +

N 2 + 1
2N 2 u−2 +

N 4 + 4N 2 + 1

6N 3

u−3 + . . . .

The relation (2.19) ensures that the R-matrix R(u) = R12(u) possesses the crossing sym-
metry properties

(cid:0)R12(u)−1(cid:1)t1 R12(cid:0)u + N(cid:1)t1 = 1

and

(cid:0)R12(u)−1(cid:1)t2 R12(cid:0)u + N(cid:1)t2 = 1.

Moreover, the following unitarity property holds

Indeed, replacing u with −u − N in (2.19) we get

R12(u)R12(−u) = 1.

g(−u) = g(−u − N)(cid:0)1 − (u + N)−2(cid:1)

(2.20)

(2.21)

and so

g(u)g(−u) (1 − u−2) = g(u + N)g(−u − N)(cid:0)1 − (u + N)−2(cid:1).

This means that the series on the left hand side is invariant under the shift u 7→ u + N
which is only possible when

g(u)g(−u) (1 − u−2) = 1

thus implying (2.21). The series g(u) can be deﬁned equivalently as a unique formal power
series of the form (2.18) satisfying the relation

g(u) g(u + 1) . . . g(u + N − 1) =(cid:0)1 − u−1(cid:1)−1.

(2.22)

To see the equivalence of the deﬁnitions, observe that by (2.19), the series G(u) deﬁned by
the left hand side of (2.22) satisﬁes G(u + 1) = G(u) (1 − u−2). However, G(u) is uniquely
determined by this relation and so coincides with the right hand side of (2.22).

Given any c ∈ C we will introduce the double Yangian at the level c as the quotient
DYc(glN ) of DY(glN ) by the ideal generated by C − c. In particular, we have the natural

and

ij = −r

(2.25)

for all r > 1; the degree of the central element C is deﬁned to be equal to zero. Denote by
gr DY(glN ) the corresponding graded algebra. We will use the notation ¯t (r)
for
the images of the generators in the respective components of the graded algebra and let C
be the image of C in the zeroth component.

and

U(cid:0)t−1glN [t−1](cid:1) → gr Y+(glN )

which are deﬁned by the assignments (2.26). We will now use the deﬁning relations (2.16)
to verify that the generators ¯t (r)
kl with r, s > 1 of the graded algebra satisfy the

desired relations in U(bglN ). Introduce re-scaled generators of DY(glN ) by setting

ij(u). So we will consider the completion bY+(glN ) of the dual Yangian with respect

To equip the double Yangian with a Hopf algebra structure, we will need to use shifts
u 7→ u + a of the variable u. They are well-deﬁned for the generator series tij(u) but not
for t+
to the descending ﬁltration deﬁned by setting the degree of t(−r)
ij with r > 1 to be equal
to r. By the deﬁning relations, the double Yangian DY(glN ) is spanned over C[C] by the
products xy with x ∈ Y+(glN ) and y ∈ Y(glN ). This follows by an easy induction based
on the relation obtained by swapping the indices i and k in (2.28) and solving the system
of equations for tij(u) t+
il (v). The extended double Yangian DY◦(glN ) can
now be deﬁned as the space of ﬁnite C[C]-linear combinations of all products of the form

kl(v) and tkj(u) t+

xy with x ∈ bY+(glN ) and y ∈ Y(glN ) with the multiplication extended by continuity from

the double Yangian.

The Hopf algebra structure on DY◦(glN ) is deﬁned by the coproduct

S : C 7→ −C;

and the counit

ε : T (u) 7→ 1,

ε : T +(u) 7→ 1,

ε : C 7→ 0.

We are now in a position to prove the Poincar´e–Birkhoﬀ–Witt theorem for the double
Yangian. We will do this for a particular ordering ≺ on the set of generators. Observe
that due to the deﬁning relations,

ij , t(s)

(cid:2)t(r)

ij (cid:3) = 0

(cid:2)t(−r)

ij

, t(−s)

ij

(cid:3) = 0

and

9

for all r, s > 1. Hence, a total ordering ≺ on the series tij(u) and t+
ij(u) will induce a
well-deﬁned total ordering on the generators (with the central element C included in the
ordering in an arbitrary way). We set t+
ij(u) ≺ tkl(u) for all i, j, k, l. Furthermore, set
t+
ij(u) ≺ t+
kl(u) and tij(u) ≺ tkl(u) if and only if (i, j) ≺ (k, l) in the lexicographical order.

Theorem 2.2. Any element of the algebra DY(glN ) can be written uniquely as a linear
combination of ordered monomials in the generators.

Proof. It follows by an easy induction from the deﬁning relations (2.2), (2.11) and (2.28)
that the ordered monomials span the algebra DY(glN ).

The next step is to demonstrate that the ordered monomials are linearly independent.
We consider the level zero algebra DY0(glN ) ﬁrst and follow an idea used by Etingof and
Kazhdan [4, Proposition 3.15] and by Nazarov [26, Proposition 2.2]. It is based on the
existence of the evaluation modules for DY0(glN ): for each nonzero a ∈ C we have the
representation deﬁned by

πa : DY0(glN ) → End C N ,

t(r)

ij

7→ a r−1 eij,

t(−r)

ij

7→ a −r eij

for all r > 1. If there is a nontrivial linear combination of ordered monomials equal to
zero, we employ the coproduct on DY0(glN ) to conclude that the image of this linear
combination is zero under any representation πa1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ πal with nonzero parameters ai.
This leads to a contradiction exactly as in [26] by considering the top degree components of
all monomials with respect to the ﬁltration deﬁned by (2.25) and by employing associated

evaluation modules over U(cid:0)glN [t, t−1](cid:1) as implied by Proposition 2.1.

To show that ordered monomials are linearly independent in DY(glN ), observe that
C 6= 0 due to the existence of the level 1 representations. Here we rely on the work by
Iohara [16] providing such representations in terms of the Drinfeld presentation of DY(glN )
to be written in terms of the RT T presentation via the Ding–Frenkel isomorphism. Now
prove by the induction on k > 1 that the powers 1, C, . . . , C k are linearly independent.
Suppose that

dk C k + · · · + d1 C + d0 = 0,

di ∈ C,

dk 6= 0.

By applying the homomorphism ϕ deﬁned in (2.23) we ﬁnd that d0 = 0. If k = 1 then
this makes a contradiction since C 6= 0. Now suppose that k > 2 and apply the coproduct
map ∆ to get

dk (C ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ C)k + · · · + d1 (C ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ C) = 0.

This simpliﬁes to

dk (k C k−1 ⊗ C + · · · + k C ⊗ C k−1) + · · · + 2d2 C ⊗ C = 0.

However, this is impossible since the powers 1, C, . . . , C k−1 are linearly independent by
the induction hypothesis. Now suppose that a linear combination of ordered monomials is

10

zero,

A(C) +X Ar1... rp

i1j1... ipjp(C)t(r1)

i1j1 . . . t(rp)

ipjp = 0,

(2.30)

where the summation is over a ﬁnite nonempty set of indices, A(C) is a polynomial in C,
and the coeﬃcients Ar1... rp
i1j1... ipjp(C) are nonzero polynomials in C. Regarding DY(glN ) as a
subalgebra of DY◦(glN ), apply the homomorphism ψ = (id ⊗ ϕ) ∆ to its elements. The
action on polynomials in C is given by

ψ : B(C) 7→ B(C) ⊗ 1,

whereas the images of the generators t(r)

ij under ψ are found from the expansions

tij(u) 7→

NXk=1

tik(u) ⊗ tkj(cid:0)u − C1/4(cid:1)

and

t+
ij(u) 7→

NXk=1

t+
ik(u) ⊗ t+

kj(cid:0)u + C1/4(cid:1).

Let p0 be the maximum length of the monomials occurring in the linear combination in
(2.30) and let r0 be the maximum degree among the monomials of length p0. Now apply
the homomorphism ψ to the left hand side of (2.30) and use the deﬁning relations of the
double Yangian to write the image as a (possibly inﬁnite) linear combination of products
of the form x ⊗ y, where x and y are ordered monomials in the generators. The deﬁning
relations and coproduct formulas imply that the part of this linear combination containing
the monomials y of length p0 and degree r0 has the form

X Ar1... rp

i1j1... ipjp(C) ⊗ t(r1)

i1j1 . . . t(rp)
ipjp,

where p = p0 and the sum of the degrees of the generators is equal to r0. On the other
hand, the ordered monomials t(r1)
ipjp are linearly independent in DY(glN ) over C, as
follows from the Poincar´e–Birkhoﬀ–Witt theorem for the level zero algebra DY0(glN ) by the
application of the homomorphism (2.23). This implies that the coeﬃcients Ar1... rp
i1j1... ipjp(C) in
(2.31) must be zero, thus making a contradiction with the assumptions in (2.30). Therefore,
all ordered monomials are linearly independent.

i1j1 . . . t(rp)

Corollary 2.3. The homomorphism (2.27) is injective and so it deﬁnes an isomorphism

(2.31)

(2.32)

U(bglN ) ∼= gr DY(glN ).

Proof. This is immediate from Theorem 2.2 and the Poincar´e–Birkhoﬀ–Witt theorem for

the algebra U(bglN ).

2.3

Invariants of the extended vacuum module

Theorem 2.2 implies the vector space decomposition for the extended double Yangian as a
C[C]-module,

DY◦(glN ) ∼= bY+(glN ) ⊗ Y(glN ).

Introduce the extended vacuum module bVc(glN ) at the level c as the quotient of the algebra
1 denote the image of 1 in the quotient. As a vector space, bVc(glN ) is isomorphic to the
completed dual Yangian bY+(glN ) due to the decomposition (2.33).
Now assume that the level is critical, c = −N, and set bVcri = bV−N (glN ). Introduce the

subspace of Y(glN )-invariants by

ij with r > 1. We let

z(bVcri) = {v ∈ bVcri | tij(u)v = δij v},
so that any element of z(bVcri) is annihilated by all operators t (r)

structure on V−N (glN ). In particular, we will see that z(bVcri) is a commutative associative
algebra which can be identiﬁed with a subalgebra of the completed dual Yangian bY+(glN ).
Our goal in this section is to construct some families of elements of z(bVcri).

We will work with the tensor product algebra

Suppose that µ is a Young diagram with m boxes whose length does not exceed N. For
a standard µ-tableau U with entries in {1, . . . , m} introduce the contents ca = ca(U) for
a = 1, . . . , m so that ca = j − i if a occupies the box (i, j) in U. Let eU ∈ C[Sm] be the
primitive idempotent associated with U through the use of the orthonormal Young bases
in the irreducible representations of Sm. The symmetric group Sm acts by permuting the
tensor factors in (C N )⊗ m. Denote by EU the image of eU under this action. We will need an
expression for EU provided by the fusion procedure originated in [17]; see also [21, Sec. 6.4]
for more details and references. By a version of the procedure, the consecutive evaluations
of the function R(u1, . . . , um) are well-deﬁned and the result is proportional to EU ,

Using the tensor product algebra (2.35), set

m(u + cm).

(2.39)

This is a power series in u whose coeﬃcients are elements of the completed dual Yangian

bY+(glN ). The series (2.39) can be regarded as a Yangian extension of the quantum im-

manants of [27]. In particular, by the argument of [27, Sec. 3.4], this series does not depend
on the standard tableau U of shape µ thus justifying the notation.

Theorem 2.4. All coeﬃcients of the series T +

a (u + ca) = R0 a(z − u − ca − N/2)−1 T +

a (u + ca) T0(z) R0 a(z − u − ca + N/2).

Hence, suppressing the arguments of the R-matrices we get

where the last equality holds since T0(z) acts as the identity operator on the subspace

R(u1, . . . , um)R0 m(u0 − um) . . . R0 1(u0 − u1)

= R0 1(u0 − u1) . . . R0 m(u0 − um)R(u1, . . . , um),

(2.42)

where u0 is another variable. This follows by a repeated application of the Yang–Baxter
equation

(2.43)

satisﬁed by the Yang R-matrix. Relation (2.42) will remain valid if each factor R0 a(u0 −ua)
is replaced with R0 a(u0 − ua). Hence, by the fusion procedure (2.38), the consecutive
evaluations ua = ca for a = 1, . . . , m imply

EU R0 m(u0 − cm) . . . R0 1(u0 − c1) = R0 1(u0 − c1) . . . R0 m(u0 − cm) EU .

By inverting the R-matrices we also get

EU R0 1(u0 − c1) −1 . . . R0 m(u0 − cm) −1 = R0 m(u0 − cm) −1 . . . R0 1(u0 − c1) −1 EU .

Returning now to the calculation of T0(z) T +

µ (u)1, recall that EU is an idempotent and

use the cyclic property of trace together with (2.37) and (2.38) to write

tr1,...,m EU X Y = tr1,...,m X ◦ EU Y = tr1,...,m X ◦ E 2

U Y

Proof. Note that

M m = T +(u) . . . T +(u − m + 1) e−m ∂u

so that the claim follows from (2.44).

Proof. The respective coeﬃcients of qdet T (u) and qdet T +(u) are central in the Yangian

A(N ) R0 N (v + N − 1) . . . R0 1(v) = A(N ) (1 − v−1);

[21, Ch. 1]. This proves that T0(z) commutes with qdet T +(u). By the same

the symmetric algebra as in [11, Ch. 3].

3 Quantum vertex algebras

We will follow [6] to introduce quantum vertex algebras. We will be most concerned with
the center of a quantum vertex algebra which we introduce by analogy with vertex algebra
theory. Our goal is to use the constructions of invariants of the extended vacuum module
given in Sec. 2.3 to describe the structure of the center; see Sec. 4 below.

3.1 Deﬁnition and basic properties

Let h be a formal parameter, V0 a complex vector space and V = V0[[h]] a topologically
free C[[h]]-module. Denote by Vh((z)) the space of all Laurent series

v(z) =Xr∈Z

vrz−r−1 ∈ V [[z±1]]

satisfying vr → 0 as r → ∞, in the h-adic topology. More precisely, Vh((z)) consists of
all Laurent series v(z) satisfying the following condition: for every n ∈ Z>0 there exists
s ∈ Z such that r > s implies vr ∈ hnV . Note that the space Vh((z)) can be identiﬁed
with V0((z))[[h]].

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let V be a topologically free C[[h]]-module. A quantum vertex algebra V
over C[[h]] is the following data.

18

(a) A C[[h]]-module map (the vertex operators)

Y : V ⊗ V → Vh((z)),

v ⊗ w 7→ Y (z)(v ⊗ w).

(3.1)

For any v ∈ V the map Y (v, z) : V → Vh((z)) is then deﬁned by

Y (v, z)w = Y (z)(v ⊗ w)

and which satisﬁes the weak associativity property: for any u, v, w ∈ V and n ∈ Z>0
there exists ℓ ∈ Z>0 such that

(z0 + z2)ℓ Y (v, z0 + z2)Y (w, z2)u −(z0 + z2)ℓ Y(cid:0)Y (v, z0)w, z2(cid:1)u ∈ hnV [[z±1

0 , z±1

2 ]]. (3.2)

(b) A vector 1 ∈ V (the vacuum vector) which satisﬁes

Y (1, z)v = v

for all v ∈ V,

and for any v ∈ V the series Y (v, z)1 is a Taylor series in z with the property

Y (v, z)1(cid:12)(cid:12)z=0 = v.

D 1 = 0;
d
dz

Y (v, z) = [D, Y (v, z)]

for all v ∈ V.

(d) A C[[h]]-module map S : V ⊗ V → V ⊗ V ⊗ C((z)) which satisﬁes

S(z)(v ⊗ w) − v ⊗ w ⊗ 1 ∈ h V ⊗ V ⊗ C((z))

for v, w ∈ V,

the unitarity condition

S21(z) = S −1(−z),

(3.10)

and the S-locality: for any v, w ∈ V and n ∈ Z>0 there exists ℓ ∈ Z>0 such that for
any u ∈ V

(z1 − z2)ℓ Y (z1)(cid:0)1 ⊗ Y (z2)(cid:1)(cid:0)S(z1 − z2)(v ⊗ w) ⊗ u(cid:1)

− (z1 − z2)ℓ Y (z2)(cid:0)1 ⊗ Y (z1)(cid:1)(w ⊗ v ⊗ u) ∈ hnV [[z±1

1 , z±1

2 ]].

(3.11)

19

In the relations used in Deﬁnition 3.1 we applied a common expansion convention: for
ℓ < 0 an expression of the form (z ± w)ℓ should be expanded into a Taylor series of the
variable appearing on the right. For example,

(z − w)−1 =Xr>0

wr
zr+1 ∈ C((z))[[w]]

and

(w − z)−1 =Xr>0

zr
wr+1 ∈ C((w))[[z]].

We will apply this convention throughout the paper, unless stated otherwise. Also, the
tensor products are understood as h-adically completed. In particular, V ⊗ V denotes the

space (V0 ⊗ V0)[[h]] and V ⊗ V ⊗ C((z)) denotes the space (cid:0)V0 ⊗ V0 ⊗ C((z))(cid:1)[[h]].

For any r ∈ Z the r-product vrw of elements v and w of V is deﬁned as the Laurent

coeﬃcient of the series

Y (v, z)w = Y (z)(v ⊗ w) =Xr∈Z

(vrw) z−r−1.

It is clear from Deﬁnition 3.1 that the quotient V = V /hV of a quantum vertex algebra

is a vertex algebra, as deﬁned, e.g. in [12], [13] and [18].

Remark 3.2. In the original deﬁnition of the quantum VOA in [6], the hexagon identity

S(z1)(cid:0)Y (z2) ⊗ 1(cid:1) =(cid:0)Y (z2) ⊗ 1(cid:1)S23(z1)S13(z2 + z1)

(3.12)

was considered instead of the weak associativity property (3.2).
It was proved therein
that (3.12) implies (3.2). Furthermore, the authors introduced the notion of nondegenerate
vertex algebra and proved that if the other axioms hold, then the hexagon identity is
equivalent to the weak associativity property when V /hV is a nondegenerate vertex algebra.

Remark 3.3. A more general notion of the -adic (weak ) quantum vertex algebra was
studied in [20]. The author proved that weak associativity (3.2) and a certain weaker form
of the S-locality (3.11) imply the Jacobi identity

0 δ(cid:18)z2 − z1

z0 (cid:19) Y (w, z2)Y (v, z1)u

0 δ(cid:18) z1 − z2

− z−1

(3.13)

so it holds for any elements u, v, w of a quantum vertex algebra V . On the other hand, the
S-locality and weak associativity can be recovered from (3.13) by using properties of the
formal δ-function deﬁned by

δ(z) =Xr∈Z

zr.

In particular, since Y (w, z0)v ∈ Vh((z0)), for every n > 0 there exists ℓ > 0 such that
0 Y (w, z0)v is a Taylor series in z0 modulo hnV [[z±1

(3.13) we recover the S-locality (3.11).

0 ]]. By taking the residue Resz0 zℓ

As with the vertex algebra theory, the translation operator D is determined by the
vertex operators. Namely, suppose that v and w are elements of a quantum vertex algebra
V . By applying (3.6) to the vector w and considering the coeﬃcient of z−r−1 we get

− r vr−1w = D vrw − vr Dw

for all r ∈ Z.

(3.14)

Now taking w = 1, r = −1 in (3.14) and using (3.4) and (3.5) we obtain

D v = v−21 for all v ∈ V.

(3.15)

3.2 The center of a quantum vertex algebra

Let V be a vertex algebra. Recall that the center of V is deﬁned by

see, e.g., [11] and [12]. Equivalently, in terms of the vertex operators we have

z(V ) =(cid:8)v ∈ V | wrv = 0 for all w ∈ V and all r > 0(cid:9) ;
z(V ) =(cid:8)v ∈ V | [Y (v, z1), Y (w, z2)] = 0 for all w ∈ V(cid:9) .

(3.16)

Consequently, the center of a vertex algebra has a structure of a unital commutative associa-
tive algebra equipped with a derivation. The multiplication is deﬁned by the (−1)-product
v · w = v−1w for v, w ∈ V .

We will now introduce a quantum version of z(V ). Let V be a quantum vertex algebra.

Deﬁne the center of V as the subspace

z(V ) = {v ∈ V | wrv = 0 for all w ∈ V and all r > 0} .

(3.17)

Proposition 3.4. Let V be a quantum vertex algebra. For any element v ∈ V and for any
w, u ∈ z(V ) we have

Y (v, z0 + z2)Y (w, z2)u = Y(cid:0)Y (v, z0)w, z2(cid:1)u.

Proof. By (3.2) for every n > 0 there exists ℓ > 0 such that

(z0 + z2)ℓ Y (v, z0 + z2)Y (w, z2)u − (z0 + z2)ℓ Y(cid:0)Y (v, z0)w, z2(cid:1)u ∈ hnV [[z±1

0 , z±1

2 ]].

Set

A(z0, z2) = Y (v, z0 + z2)Y (w, z2)u

and

B(z0, z2) = Y(cid:0)Y (v, z0)w, z2(cid:1)u.

21

(3.18)

(3.19)

The deﬁnition of the center (3.17), together with the assumptions w, u ∈ z(V ), imply
B(z0, z2) ∈ V [[z0, z2]]. Similarly, we have Y (w, z2)u ∈ V [[z2]] because u ∈ z(V ) and so
A(z0, z2) ∈ V ((z0))[[z2]]. However, by (3.1) we have Y (a, z)b ∈ Vh((z)) for all a, b ∈ V , and
hence A(z0, z2) ∈ V0((z0))[[h]][[z2]]. Furthermore, observe that (z0 + z2)±ℓ ∈ C((z0))((z2)).
Since V0 is a vector space over C, we may regard VF = V0((z0))((h))((z2)) as a vector

space over the ﬁeld F = C((z0))((h))((z2)). By the above argument,

A(z0, z2), B(z0, z2) ∈ VF

and

(z0 + z2)±ℓ ∈ F.

Therefore, multiplying (3.19) by (z0 + z2)−ℓ ∈ C((z0))((z2)) ⊂ F we ﬁnd

Relation (3.20) holds for all n > 0 which implies

Y (v, z0 + z2)Y (w, z2)u − Y(cid:0)Y (v, z0)w, z2(cid:1)u ∈ hnV [[z±1

We point out some consequences of Proposition 3.4. Observe that the right hand side

The coeﬃcient of z−1
in (3.25) is zero and so v0wsu = 0 for all s ∈ Z (note that wsu = 0 for
s > 0). By taking the coeﬃcient of z−2
0 we ﬁnd that v1wsu = 0 for all s ∈ Z. Continuing
by the induction on the power of z0 in (3.25) we conclude that vrwsu = 0 for all s ∈ Z and
r > 0. Hence, wsu ∈ z(V ) for all s ∈ Z so the proposition follows.

Deﬁne the product z(V ) ⊗ z(V ) → z(V ) on the center of a quantum vertex algebra V

by setting

w · u = w−1u

for any w, u ∈ z(V ).

(3.26)

By Proposition 3.5 the product is well-deﬁned.

Proposition 3.6. The product (3.26) deﬁnes the structure of a unital associative algebra
on z(V ). Moreover, this algebra is equipped with a derivation deﬁned as the restriction of
the translation operator D.

Proof. Let v, w, u be arbitrary elements of z(V ). By taking the constant terms in (3.24) we
get (v · w) · u = v · (w · u). Furthermore, (3.3) implies 1 · v = v, while (3.4) implies v · 1 = v
and 1 ∈ z(V ), so 1 is the identity in the associative algebra z(V ).

Taking r > 0 in (3.14), we ﬁnd that Dw ∈ z(V ) for any w ∈ z(V ) so that the restriction
of D is a well-deﬁned operator on z(V ). By setting w = 1 and considering the coeﬃcient
of z0 in (3.24) we get v−21−1u = (v−21)−1u for all v, u ∈ z(V ). Therefore, using (3.15) and
vacuum axiom (3.3) we calculate

(Dv) · u = (Dv)−1u = (v−21)−1u = v−21−1u = v−2u.

Using (3.14) with r = −1 we can write this as Dv−1u − v−1Du = D(v · u) − v · D(u). Since
D1 = 0 by (3.5), we conclude that D : z(V ) → z(V ) is a derivation.

The ﬁnal result of this section will demonstrate that the center of a quantum vertex
algebra is S-commutative, as stated in the next proposition. This replaces the commuta-
tivity property of the center of a vertex algebra in the quantum case. In general, the center
of a quantum vertex algebra need not be commutative, as demonstrated by Proposition 4.2
below.

Proposition 3.7. Let V be a quantum vertex algebra. For any w ∈ V and any v, u ∈ z(V )
we have

Y (z1)(cid:0)1 ⊗ Y (z2)(cid:1)(cid:0)S(z1 − z2)(v ⊗ w) ⊗ u(cid:1) = Y (z2)(cid:0)1 ⊗ Y (z1)(cid:1)(w ⊗ v ⊗ u).

(3.27)

23

Proof. By (3.11) for any w ∈ V , v ∈ z(V ) and n > 0 there exists ℓ > 0 such that for any
u ∈ z(V ) we have

(z1 − z2)ℓ Y (z1)(cid:0)1 ⊗ Y (z2)(cid:1)(cid:0)S(z1 − z2)(v ⊗ w) ⊗ u(cid:1)

− (z1 − z2)ℓ Y (z2)(cid:0)1 ⊗ Y (z1)(cid:1)(w ⊗ v ⊗ u) ∈ hnV [[z±1

1 , z±1

2 ]].

(3.28)

(3.29)

Since v and u lie in the center of V and the center is closed under all s-products by
Proposition 3.5, the expression Y (z1)(v ⊗ u) occurring in (3.29) is a Taylor series in z1 with
coeﬃcients in z(V ). Therefore,

Y (z2)(cid:0)1 ⊗ Y (z1)(cid:1)(w ⊗ v ⊗ u) ∈ V [[z1, z2]].

Now consider (3.28). Recall that S(z)(a ⊗ b) ∈ V ⊗ V ⊗ C((z)) for any a, b ∈ V . Since

u ∈ z(V ), the expression (cid:0)1 ⊗ Y (z2)(cid:1)(cid:0)S(z1 − z2)(v ⊗ w) ⊗ u(cid:1) lies in (V0 ⊗ V0)((z1))[[h]][[z2]]

and can be written as

Xk>0(cid:16)Xﬁn

v(1)
k ⊗ v(2)

k ⊗ ak(z1 − z2)(cid:17)hk,

(3.30)

where the internal sum is ﬁnite and denotes an element of V0 ⊗ V0 ⊗ C((z1))[[z2]]. Applying
the operator Y (z1) to (3.30) we get

Xk>0(cid:16)Xﬁn

Y (v(1)

For every m > 0 the coeﬃcient of zm
1 ], so the internal ﬁnite
2
sum is an element of Vh((z1))[[z2]] ≡ V0((z1))[[h]][[z2]] for every k > 0. Hence, we conclude
that (3.31) lies in V0((z1))[[h]][[z2]]. The proof is now completed as for Proposition 3.4 by
multiplying the expression which occurs in (3.28) and (3.29) by (z1 − z2)−ℓ.

in ak(z1 − z2) lies in C[z−1

Remark 3.8. By the deﬁnition of z(V ), the center z(V ) of the vertex algebra V = V /hV
coincides with z(V )/h z(V ). Hence, due to the property (3.7) of the map S, we recover
from Proposition 3.7 that the product on z(V ) is commutative.

4 Quantum aﬃne vertex algebra

Following [6] we introduce the quantum vertex algebra associated with the double Yangian
for glN . In accordance with the general deﬁnitions of Sec. 3, we will consider this algebra
as a module over C[[h]]. So we will start by restating deﬁnitions of Sec. 2.2 in this context
and then verify the axioms for the quantum vertex algebra on the vacuum module.

24

4.1 Double Yangian over C[[h]]

From now on we will work with algebras and modules over C[[h]] and keep the same
notation for the objects associated with the double Yangian DY(glN ) as in Sec. 2.2. The
deﬁnitions of the algebras are readily translated into the C[[h]]-module context by the
formal re-scaling u 7→ u/h of the ‘spectral parameter’ and generators

7→ hr−1 t(r)

t(−r)

7→ h−r t(−r)

,

C 7→ C,

for r > 1. Conversely, the formal evaluation h = 1 can be used to recover some of the
deﬁnitions and formulas of Sec. 2.2. The Yang R-matrix (2.3) now takes the form

while for the normalized R-matrix (2.17) we have

R(u) = 1 − P hu−1,

R(u) = g(u/h)(cid:0)1 − P hu−1(cid:1).

The double Yangian DY(glN ) is now deﬁned as the associative algebra over C[[h]]
, where 1 6 i, j 6 N and

generated by the central element C and elements t(r)

where the tensor products are understood as h-adically completed. The antipode and
counit are deﬁned by the same formulas as for the extended double Yangian DY◦(glN ); see
Sec. 2.2.

The Poincar´e–Birkhoﬀ–Witt theorem for the double Yangian extends to the algebra
DY(glN ) over C[[h]]; see Theorem 2.2. Therefore the subalgebra of DY(glN ) generated by
the elements t(r)
ij with 1 6 i, j 6 N and r > 1 can be identiﬁed with the Yangian Y(glN )
deﬁned by the relations (4.3). Similarly, the subalgebra generated by the elements t(−r)
with 1 6 i, j 6 N and r > 1 can be identiﬁed with the dual Yangian Y+(glN ) deﬁned by
the relations (4.4).

4.2 Vacuum module as a quantum vertex algebra

The double Yangian at the level c ∈ C is the quotient DYc(glN ) of DY(glN ) by the ideal
generated by C − c. Similar to Sec. 2.3, the vacuum module Vc(glN ) at the level c over the
double Yangian is the quotient

Vc(glN ) = DYc(glN )/DYc(glN )ht (r)

ij

| r > 1i.

(4.7)

By the Poincar´e–Birkhoﬀ–Witt theorem (Theorem 2.2), we can identify this quotient with
the dual Yangian Y+(glN ) as a C[[h]]-module.

As demonstrated in [6], the h-adically completed vacuum module possesses a quantum
vertex algebra structure. In the classical limit h → 0 it turns into the aﬃne vertex algebra
Vc(glN ). Accordingly, (4.7) is called the quantum aﬃne vertex algebra. To introduce the
structure, we need some notation. For a positive integer n, consider the tensor product
space

(End CN )⊗n ⊗ Vc(glN ).

(4.8)

Given a variable z and a family of variables u = (u1, . . . , un), set

Tn(u) = T1 n+1(u1) . . . Tn n+1(un),

T +
n (u) = T +

1 n+1(u1) . . . T +

n n+1(un),

Tn(u|z) = T1 n+1(z + u1) . . . Tn n+1(z + un),

T +
n (u|z) = T +

1 n+1(z + u1) . . . T +

n n+1(z + un).

Here we extend the notation (2.8) to include the vacuum module as a component of tensor
products so that the subscript n + 1 corresponds to Vc(glN ). For n = 0 these products will
be considered as being equal to the identity. The respective components of the matrices
(4.6) are understood as operators on Vc(glN ). The series Ti n+1(z + ui) and T +
i n+1(z + ui)
should be expanded in nonpositive and nonnegative powers of z, respectively.

26

For nonnegative integers m and n introduce functions depending on a variable z and

the families of variables u = (u1, . . . , un) and v = (v1, . . . , vm) with values in the space

(4.10)

with the arrows indicating the order of the factors, where we use the Yang R-matrix (4.1)
and adopt the matrix notation as in (2.8). As above, empty products will be understood
12
nm(u|v|z) by the same formula (4.10),
as being equal to the identity. We also deﬁne R
where the R-matrix (4.2) is used instead of R(u). The superscripts 1 and 2 are meant to
indicate the tensor factors in (4.9). We also adopt the superscript notation for multiple
tensor products of the form

(End CN )⊗n ⊗ (End CN )⊗m ⊗ (End CN )⊗k ⊗ Vc(glN ) ⊗ Vc(glN ) ⊗ Vc(glN ).

(4.11)

n (u) or T 35

Expressions like T 14
k (u) will be understood as the respective operators Tn(u)
or Tk(u), whose non-identity components belong to the corresponding tensor factors. In
particular, the non-identity components of T 35

k (u) belong to the factors

n + m + 1, n + m + 2, . . . , n + m + k and n + m + k + 2.

Employing this notation, we point out some immediate consequences of the deﬁning

relations (4.3)–(4.5) for operators on

(End CN )⊗n ⊗ (End CN )⊗m ⊗ Vc(glN ).

They follow by a straightforward induction and take the form

(4.14)

It will also be convenient to use an ordered product notation for elements of the tensor
product of two associative algebras A ⊗ B. Suppose that A1, A2 ∈ A and B1, B2 ∈ B. Let
F = A1 ⊗ B1 and deﬁne the following products

llF (A2 ⊗ B2) = A1A2 ⊗ B1B2,

lrF (A2 ⊗ B2) = A1A2 ⊗ B2B1,

rlF (A2 ⊗ B2) = A2A1 ⊗ B1B2,

rrF (A2 ⊗ B2) = A2A1 ⊗ B2B1,

(4.15)

27

indicating the left and right multiplication of the components. For α, β ∈ {l, r} we will

denote by (αβF )−1 the operator G such that (αβG)F = 1. Note that (αβF )−1 and αβ(cid:0)F −1(cid:1)

need not be equal.

This notation will often be applied to products of R-matrices F = R12

nm(u|v|z), where
the roles of A and B will be played by the ﬁrst and second components in (4.9). We point
out the formulas for the inverse operators associated with the R-matrix (4.1):

(cid:0)lrR(u)(cid:1)−1 =(cid:0)rlR(u)(cid:1)−1 =(cid:0)1 − hNu−1(cid:1)−1(cid:0)R(−u) − hNu−1(cid:1),
(cid:0)llR(u)(cid:1)−1 =(cid:0)rrR(u)(cid:1)−1 = R(u)−1 =(cid:0)1 − h2u−2(cid:1)−1R(−u),

which can be used to calculate the inverse operators corresponding to F = R12

nm(u|v|z).

We will now use the general deﬁnition of quantum vertex algebra reproduced in Sec. 3;

see Deﬁnition 3.1. The following theorem is due to Etingof and Kazhdan [6].

Theorem 4.1. There exists a unique well-deﬁned structure of quantum vertex algebra on
the vacuum module Vc(glN ) with the following data.

(a) The vacuum vector is

1 = 1 ∈ Vc(glN ).

(b) The vertex operators are deﬁned by

Y(cid:0)T +

n (u)1, z(cid:1) = T +

n (u|z) Tn(u|z + hc/2)−1.

(4.16)

(4.17)

(c) The translation operator D is deﬁned by

ezD T +(u1) . . . T +(un)1 = T +(z + u1) . . . T +(z + un)1.

(d) The map S is deﬁned by the relation

(4.20)

Proof. We add some details as compared to [6], to take care of the variations of the deﬁni-
tion of the quantum vertex algebra. Let V = Vc(glN ). We start by pointing out that Y is
a well-deﬁned operator as in (3.1). Indeed, since the coeﬃcients of the series T +
n (u)1 span

28

Vc(glN ), it suﬃces to verify that Y preserves the ideal of relations of the dual Yangian.
This follows by employing (4.3) and (4.4) as in the proof of [6, Lemma 2.1]. As a next
step, we will verify the weak associativity property (3.2). Let m, n and k be nonnegative
integers and let u = (u1, . . . , un), v = (v1, . . . , vm) and w = (w1, . . . , wk) be families of
variables. Note the following relation which is a consequence of (4.14):

of the vacuum module together with (4.17) and (4.21) we get

Observe that after multiplication by (z0 + z2)ℓ this coincides with (4.24). Therefore, when

nm(u|v|z0+hc)−1)−1(cid:1) to both sides of this equality we get (3.2), as required.

The vacuum axioms (3.3) and (3.4) are immediate from the deﬁnitions of the vacuum

Now we verify the translation operator D is well-deﬁned by (4.18) and satisﬁes the
axioms (3.5) and (3.6). We need to check that D preserves the deﬁning relations (4.4) of
the dual Yangian. This is a straightforward calculation; cf. [6, Lemma 2.1]. Furthermore,
ezD1 = 1 so that (3.5) holds. Now suppose that m and n are nonnegative integers. Taking

thus verifying (3.6). Now turn to the axioms concerning the map S. Using the notation

This form of S is convenient for checking that the map is well-deﬁned; cf. [6, Lemma 2.1].
Furthermore, (3.7) clearly holds since the value of the R-matrix (4.2) at h = 0 is the
identity operator. Property (3.8) is checked in the same way as (3.6) with the use of
(4.26). The Yang–Baxter equation (3.9), the unitarity condition (3.10) and the S-locality
property (3.11) are veriﬁed by straightforward calculations which rely on the Yang–Baxter
equation (2.43) satisﬁed by the R-matrix (4.2) and the unitarity property (2.21).

We now give an example based on the structure of the dual Yangian to demonstrate
that the center of a quantum vertex algebra need not be commutative, in general. We use
the same notation for products of generators matrices as in the beginning of this section.

Proposition 4.2. There exists a unique well-deﬁned structure of quantum vertex algebra
on the C[[h]]-module V = Y+(glN ) with the following data.

(a) The vacuum vector is

1 = 1 ∈ Y+(glN ).

(b) The vertex operators are deﬁned by

Y(cid:0)T +

n (u)1, z(cid:1) = T +

n (u|z).

(4.27)

(4.28)

(c) The translation operator D is deﬁned by

ezD T +(u1) . . . T +(un)1 = T +(z + u1) . . . T +(z + un)1.

(4.29)

(d) The map S is deﬁned by the relation

(4.30)

Moreover, the center z(V ) of the quantum vertex algebra V coincides with V .

Proof. The last claim follows since the image of the vertex operator map Y is contained
in V [[z]]. In particular, z(V ) is not commutative for N > 2.

The maps Y , D and S are well-deﬁned, as follows by the same arguments as for the
proof of Theorem 4.1. The quantum vertex algebra axioms are also checked in a similar
way with some obvious modiﬁcations. We only verify the S-commutativity (3.27) which
implies the S-locality property (3.11). Set z = z1 − z2 and consider the left hand side in
(3.27). The application of S45(z) ⊗ 1 to

Now (4.12) implies that (4.31) coincides with (4.32) and so the S-commutativity property

4.3 Central elements of the completed double Yangian

As with the aﬃne vertex algebras, the vertex operator formulas (4.17) suggest a construc-
tion of central elements of a completed double Yangian; cf. [11, Sec. 4.3.2] and Remark 4.6
below. However, we will not use the quantum vertex algebra structure, but rather give a
direct proof as in [10].

Introduce the completion of the double Yangian DYc(glN ) at the level c as the inverse

limit

DYc(glN )/Ip,

(4.33)

gDYc(glN ) = lim

←−

where p > 1 and Ip denotes the left ideal of DYc(glN ), generated by all elements t(r)
ij with
r > p. Using the idempotents EU as in Theorem 2.4, introduce the Laurent series in u with

critical level c = −N by

coeﬃcients in the h-adically completed algebra of formal power series gDY−N (glN ) at the

where ca = ca(U) is the content of the box occupied by a ∈ {1, . . . , m} in the standard

tableau U. By the argument of [27, Sec. 3.4], the series eT µ(u) does not depend on the
Theorem 4.3. All coeﬃcients of eT µ(u) belong to the center of the h-adically completed
algebra gDY−N (glN ).

33

Proof. We need to show that

T0(z)eT µ(u) = eT µ(u) T0(z)

and

T +

0 (z)eT µ(u) = eT µ(u) T +

0 (z).

Repeat the corresponding part of the proof of Theorem 2.4 and use the relations

(4.35)

T0(z) R0 a(z − u − hca + hN/2) Ta(cid:0)u + hca − hN/2(cid:1)−1

implied by (2.4) to get

where we set

the ﬁrst relation in (4.35). A similar calculation veriﬁes the second relation. It relies on
the identity

T +

0 (z) R0 a(z − u − hca) Ta(cid:0)u + hca − hN/2(cid:1)−1

which follows from (2.16) with the use of (2.21).

= Ta(cid:0)u + hca − hN/2(cid:1)−1 R0 a(z − u − hca + hN) T +

0 (z)

The following formula for eT µ(u) in the case where µ = (1N ) is a column diagram is a

consequence of (2.48) and its counterpart for the matrix T (u).

Proposition 4.4. At the critical level c = −N we have

(1N )(u) = qdet T +(u)(cid:0)qdet T (u − hN/2)(cid:1)−1.

eT

By applying eT µ(u) to the vacuum vector of the module V−N (glN ) we get

eT µ(u)1 = T +

where

in accordance with Sec. 2.3. In particular, Theorem 2.4 follows from Theorem 4.3; cf. [10].
As another application of (4.36), we get the following.

Corollary 4.5. The coeﬃcients of all series T +

ν (u)1 = T +

ν (u)eT µ(u)1 = T +

ν (u) T +

µ (u)1.

Swapping the operators, we conclude that the coeﬃcients of the series T +
pairwise commute in the dual Yangian.

we get Y(cid:0)T+

Remark 4.6. By the deﬁnition (4.17) of the vertex operators, evaluating (4.37) at u = 0

4.4 Center of the quantum aﬃne vertex algebra

By Proposition 3.6, the center of a quantum vertex algebra is an associative algebra with
respect to the product deﬁned in (3.26). Moreover, due to Proposition 3.7, this algebra is
S-commutative, i.e. its elements satisfy (3.27). The results of this section will imply that
the center of the quantum aﬃne vertex algebra Vc(glN ) associated with glN is commutative,
so it shares the commutativity property of the center of a vertex algebra; cf. [11, Lemma
3.3.2]. It follows from the deﬁnition (3.17) that the center coincides with the subspace of
invariants

for r > 1 and all i, j}

(4.38)

z(cid:0)Vc(glN )(cid:1) = {v ∈ Vc(glN ) | t (r)

ij v = 0

of the h-adically completed vacuum module Vc(glN ); cf. (2.34). Hence, z(cid:0)Vc(glN )(cid:1) can be

identiﬁed with a subspace of the h-adically completed dual Yangian Y+(glN ). Moreover,
it follows from (4.17) that the product (3.26) on the center coincides with the product
in the algebra Y+(glN ). Therefore, by Proposition 3.6 the center can be regarded as a
D-invariant associative subalgebra of the dual Yangian.

Now assume that the level is critical, c = −N, and set Vcri = V−N (glN ). In Corollar-
ies 2.5 and 2.6 we constructed three families of invariants of the extended vacuum module
In accordance with the deﬁnition (3.17), we can reformulate these
at the critical level.
results for the current setting by stating that all coeﬃcients of the series

tr T +(u) . . . T +(u − hm + h),

belong to the center z(Vcri) of the quantum aﬃne vertex algebra Vcri (we have used the
shift u 7→ u − hm + h for the ﬁrst series). We will use these families to produce generators

35

of z(Vcri). Extend Vcri
elements as coeﬃcients of the series

and

Θm(u) =

Proposition 4.7. All coeﬃcients of the series Φm(u), Ψm(u) and Θm(u) belong to the
C[[h]]-module z(Vcri). Moreover, each family Φ(r)
m with m = 1, . . . , N and
r = 0, 1, . . . is algebraically independent.

m and Θ(r)

m , Ψ(r)

Proof. First consider the series Φm(u). As in Sec. 2.3 embed the dual Yangian into the
algebra of formal series Y+(glN )[[u, ∂u]] and introduce the element

tr1,...,m A(m)(cid:0)1 − T +

1 (u)e−h ∂u(cid:1) . . .(cid:0)1 − T +

m (u)e−h ∂u(cid:1)

(4.39)

as in (2.50). By repeating the corresponding argument in Sec. 2.3 we ﬁnd that the element
(4.39) coincides with

(−1)k(cid:18)N − k

m − k(cid:19) tr1,...,k A(k) T +

1 (u) . . . T +

k (u − hk + h)e−k h ∂u.

mXk=0

(4.40)

Observe that the constant term of (4.40), as a formal power series in ∂u, coincides with
hm Φm(u). On the other hand, each factor in (4.39) takes the form

1 − T +

i (u)e−h ∂u ≡ h (∂u + T (−1) + T (−2) u + . . . ) mod h2 Vcri,

ij

where T (−r) = [t(−r)
] is the matrix of generators. This shows that the series hm Φm(u)
belongs to hm Y+(glN )[[u]] and so all coeﬃcients of Φm(u) belong to the C[[h]]-module
z(Vcri). Furthermore, taking the classical limit h = 0 we ﬁnd that the image of the series
T (−1) + T (−2) u + . . .
in (2.52). By Corollary 2.9, the family of elements φ(r)
m m, found as constant terms of
the polynomials (2.53) in ∂u, is algebraically independent. Hence so is the family of the

m , we may assume that at least one of its coeﬃcients is not

The arguments for the families Ψm(u) and Θm(u) are quite similar. One additional

observation for the family Ψm(u) is the identity

1 (u − hm + h) . . . T +

m (u) = tr1,...,m T +

1 (u) . . . T +

m (u − hm + h)H (m).

It follows by applying the fusion formula (2.38) for H (m), then the deﬁning relations (2.12)
and the conjugation by the longest permutation of Sm.

We can now prove a quantum analogue of the Feigin–Frenkel theorem [7]; see Sec. 2.3.

r = 0, 1, . . .

It is
m with m = 1, . . . , N and

m and Θ(r)

m , Ψ(r)

Proof. First we point out that the coeﬃcients of all series Φm(u), Ψm(u) and Θm(u) pair-
wise commute. This is well-known for the Yangian counterparts of the series introduced
in Corollaries 2.5 and 2.6 (with the matrix T +(u) replaced with T (u)) in relation with
Bethe subalgebras [19]; see also [21, Ch. 1]. The same proof applies for the dual Yangian.
Alternatively, this fact is obtained as a consequence of Corollary 4.5.

Now suppose that w ∈ z(Vcri). We will prove by induction that for all n > 0 there
m such that w − Q ∈ hnVcri. Assuming that this

exists a polynomial Q in the variables Φ(r)
holds for some n > 0, write

w − Q = hn wn + hn+1 wn+1 + . . .

with wk ∈ V0,

where we assume that Vcri = V0[[h]]. Since w − Q belongs to the center of the vacuum
module, we can conclude that wn ∈ z(Vcri) mod h. Taking the classical limit h = 0 we

ﬁnd that the image wn of wn in U(cid:0)t−1glN [t−1](cid:1) belongs to the Feigin–Frenkel center z(bglN ).

m m; see Corollary 2.9. Replace these
m to get a polynomial S′ ∈ z(Vcri). The diﬀerence

Therefore, wn is a polynomial S in the variables φ(r)
variables with the respective elements Φ(r)
wn − S′ belongs to hVcri. Therefore,

w − Q − hn S′ ∈ hn+1Vcri,

which completes the induction argument.

Thus, any element w ∈ z(Vcri) can be approximated by polynomials in the variables
m and so they are topological generators of the center. The same argument works for the

Φ(r)
other two families. In particular, this implies that the algebra z(Vcri) is commutative.
