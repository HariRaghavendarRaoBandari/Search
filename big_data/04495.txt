radion-dominated state?

Abstract

We discuss the possibility of interpreting the 125 GeV scalar boson and the 750 GeV
diphoton excess recently reported by the ATLAS and CMS experiments as a Higgs-
dominated and a radion-dominated states respectively in a stabilized brane-world model.
It is shown that in the simplest variant of the model, where only the gravitational degrees
of freedom propagate in the bulk, the production cross section of the radion-dominated
state with mass 750 GeV turns out to be too small in the allowed region of the model
parameter space for explaining the nature of the excess in this approach.

Introduction

The 750 GeV diphoton excess that has been recently presented by the LHC experiments [1, 2]
can be the ﬁrst direct evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), if it is conﬁrmed
by further searches at larger statistics. The most plausible explanation of this excess seems to
be the production of a new heavy scalar state 1. There have been already numerous attempts
either to explain the excess in a model independent way (see, e.g., [3]), or to associate it with
the scalar states predicted by concrete SM extensions (see, e.g., [4]), in particular, to interpret
it as a mixed Higgs-radion state [5, 6] in the Randall-Sundrum model [7].

In the present paper we consider the case, where the two scalar states are interpreted as
mixed Higgs-radion states in an extension of the SM based on the Randall-Sundrum model
with two branes stabilized by a bulk scalar ﬁeld [8, 9, 10, 11], which is necessary for the model
to be phenomenologically acceptable. A characteristic feature of this extension is the presence
of a massive scalar radion ﬁeld together with its Kaluza-Klein tower. These ﬁelds have the
same quantum numbers as the neutral Higgs ﬁeld and can mix with the Higgs ﬁeld, if they are
coupled.

Usually, the Higgs-radion coupling in the Randall-Sundrum model is obtained by introducing
a Higgs-curvature term on the brane [12]. In paper [13] a model was discussed, where a Higgs-
radion coupling arises due to a mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking on the brane
involving the stabilizing scalar ﬁeld. This approach takes into account the inﬂuence of the
KK tower of higher scalar excitations on the parameters of the Higgs-radion mixing, which
turns out to be of importance. It also has the advantage that, unlike the approach based on
the Higgs-curvature term, it modiﬁes only the scalar sector of the model and leaves intact the
masses and the coupling constants of the graviton KK excitations.

1A vector state cannot decay to two photons because of the Landau-Yang theorem. Spin two states can.
However, if they are somehow related to the graviton excitations similar excesses should appear in di-lepton
and di-jet decay modes, which are not seen in the LHC experiments.

1

Here we will use the eﬀective interaction Lagrangian obtained in paper [13] to describe the
couplings of the mixed Higgs-radion states to the SM ﬁelds and to analyze the interpretation
of the excess as a 750 GeV mixed Higgs-radion scalar state.

2 Higgs-radion interaction and the eﬀective Lagrangian

First let us brieﬂy recall the main features of the model (details are given in [13]). It is a variant
of the stabilized RS model with all the SM ﬁelds located on the UV brane and the stabilizing
Goldberger-Wise scalar ﬁeld propagating in the bulk along with the gravitational ﬁeld. The
mixing of the Higgs and gravitational scalar ﬁelds arises in the model due to an interaction
Lagrangian leading to a relation between the Higgs vev and the value of the stabilizing ﬁeld on
the UV brane that correspond to the minimum of the potential.

The model in ﬁve-dimensional space-time E = M4×S1/Z2 with coordinates {xM} ≡ {xµ, y},
M = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, µ = 0, 1, 2, 3, the coordinate x4 ≡ y, −L ≤ y ≤ L parameterizing the ﬁfth
dimension is deﬁned by the action

where Sg and Sφ+SM are given by

S = Sg + Sφ+SM ,

The signature of the metric gM N is chosen to be (+,−,−,−,−), M is the fundamental ﬁve-
dimensional energy scale, V (φ) is a bulk stubilizing scalar ﬁeld potential and V1,2(φ) are brane
scalar ﬁeld potentials, ˜g = det˜gµν, and ˜gµν denotes the metric induced on the branes. The space
of extra dimension is the orbifold S1/Z2, which is realized as the circle of circumference 2L with
the points y and −y identiﬁed. Correspondingly, the metric gM N and the scalar ﬁeld φ satisfy
the standard orbifold symmetry conditions and the branes are located at the ﬁxed points of
the orbifold, y = 0 and y = L. The SM ﬁelds are assumed to be localized on the brane at
y = L, and the Lagrangian LSM−HP is the SM Lagrangian without the Higgs potential. The
key point of the approach under consideration is the replacement of the Higgs potential by the
interaction Lagrangian

of the Higgs and Goldberger-Wise ﬁelds, ξ being a positive dimensionless parameter.

The background solutions for the metric and the scalar ﬁeld, which preserve the Poincar´e

invariance in any four-dimensional subspace y = const, look like

Higgs ﬁeld is standard

all the other SM ﬁelds being equal to zero.

The brane scalar ﬁeld potentials V1,2(φ) are chosen so that they ﬁx the values of the sta-
bilizing ﬁeld φ on the branes and stabilize the interbrane distance [8]. For this reason, if
one substitutes this ansatz into the equations corresponding to action (1), one gets a relation
between the vacuum value of the Higgs ﬁeld and the value of the ﬁeld φ on the brane at y = L

φ(L)2 =

.

(8)

This means that in such a scenario the Higgs ﬁeld vacuum expectation value, being pro-
portional to the value of the stabilizing scalar ﬁeld on the TeV brane, arises dynamically as a
result of the gravitational bulk stabilization.

Now the linearized theory is obtained by expanding the metric, the scalar and the Higgs

ﬁeld in the unitary gauge around the background solution as

gM N (x, y) = γM N (y) +

hM N (x, y),

φ(x, y) = φ(y) +

(11)

After substituting this representation into action (1) and keeping the terms of the second order
in hM N , f and σ one gets the Lagrangian of this action which is the standard free Lagrangian
of the SM (i.e. the masses of all the SM ﬁelds are expressed in the same way as usually in terms
of the vacuum value of the Higgs ﬁeld and the coupling constants) together with the standard
second variation Lagrangian of the stabilized RS model [11] supplemented by an interaction
term of ﬁelds f and σ on the brane coming from interaction Lagrangian (4) [13].

The bulk scalar ﬁeld f can be expanded in KK modes, the lowest mode φ1(x) is called the
radion ﬁeld and the modes φn(x), n > 1 belong to its KK tower. Substituting this expansion
into the second variation Lagrangian and integrating over the extra dimension coordinate, one
gets an eﬀective four-dimensional Lagrangian. In case the Higgs and the radion masses are
much lower than the masses of the radion excitations on can pass to a low energy approxima-
tion in the four-dimensional Lagrangian by integrating out the radion excitation ﬁelds. This
gives an eﬀective Lagrangian for the interactions of the Higgs and radion ﬁelds with the SM
ﬁelds. However, due to the Higgs-radion mixing terms the ﬁelds σ(x) and φ1(x) are not mass
eigenstates.

The physical mass eigenstate ﬁelds h(x), r(x) are, as usually, obtained by a rotation diago-

nalizing the mass matrix

h(x) = cos θ σ(x) + sin θ φ1(x)
r(x) = − sin θ σ(x) + cos θ φ1(x).

(15)

It also depends on the sum of the coeﬃcients α2
n, where αn is the ratio of the wave functions in
the extra dimension of the modes φn and φ1 taken at y = L . These ratios are, of course, model
dependent and should fall oﬀ with n in order for the sum to be convergent. In certain models
several ﬁrst ratios may be of the order of unity [11]. Thus, one can conservatively estimate this
sum to be also of the order of unity.

The eﬀective four-dimensional interaction Lagrangian (13) expressed in terms of the physical
Higgs-dominated h(x) and radion-dominated r(x) ﬁelds involves only ﬁve extra parameters in
addition to those of the SM: the masses of the Higgs-dominated and radion-dominated ﬁelds
mh and mr, the mixing angle θ, the (inverse) coupling constant of the radion to the trace of
the energy-momentum tensor of the SM ﬁelds Λr and the parameter c.

Let us consider several interesting subspaces of the parameter space of the eﬀective theory.
If we put the parameters c and θ equal to zero, i.e. consider the case of the zero mixing,
Lagrangian (13) becomes just the SM Higgs Lagrangian plus the usual Lagrangian of the
radion interaction with the trace of the SM energy-momentum tensor. If we put 1/Λr = 0, we
get the eﬀective Lagrangian of the real Higgs singlet extension of the Standard Model [14, 15].
If we formally put the parameter c equal to zero while keeping the mixing angle θ non-zero, we

4

obtain an eﬀective interaction Lagrangian which is very similar to the one of the unstabilized
RS model with the Higgs-curvature term on the brane [12]. In particular, the couplings of the
Higgs-dominated and the radion-dominated states to the conformal anomaly of massless vector
ﬁelds, which turn to be very important for their production and decay to two photons, are
the same. However, one should keep in mind that the observable parameters of the eﬀective
Lagrangian in diﬀerent cases depend diﬀerently on the fundamental parameters of the models.
Thus, Lagrangian (13) is a very general eﬀective Lagrangian of the interaction of two mixed
scalar states with the fermion and vector ﬁelds of the Standard Model extended by a singlet
scalar. The extra parameters of this Lagrangian are natural for considering the phenomenology
of the mixed scalar states and allow one to compare easily the predictions of diﬀerent models.
In fact, it is unimportant, how they depend on the fundamental parameters of a particular
model as long as the latter belong to the phenomenologically acceptable parameter subspace.
In the general case of a non-zero mixing, when all the parameters and θ, 1/Λr, and c are not
equal to zero, the additional terms in the Lagrangian, coming from the integrated out heavy
modes and containing the parameter c that depends on the scalar state masses and the mixing
angle, may lead to certain changes in the collider phenomenology of the Higgs-dominated and
radion-dominated states as was demonstrated in [13], where also the Feynman rules for the
model are explicitly given.

3 Phenomenology of the 750 GeV radion-dominated state

In order to understand whether or not the 750 GeV observed excess may be interpreted as a
radion-dominated state in the above described stabilized brane world model let us consider the
main decay and production properties of such a state as follow from eﬀective Lagrangian (13).
For the computations a special version of the CompHEP code [16, 17] was used in the same
manner as was done in [13]. The version includes a special routine for χ2-analysis of signal
strengths and implements the Feynman rules corresponding to eﬀective Lagrangian (13).

The decay branching ratios for the radion-dominated state with mass 750 GeV are shown
in Fig. 1 as functions of the mixing angle parameter sin θ. One can see that practically for
all the values of the mixing parameter sin θ the branching ratios are distributed between the
modes close to those for the SM Higgs boson, if it would have had mass 750 GeV. The NLO
corrections are included following the HDECAY code [18]. The dominating decay modes are
the decays to heavy SM particles W +W −, ZZ boson pairs and the top quark pair. However, for
some rather small values of the parameter sin θ close to approximately v/Λr all the branching
ratios are signiﬁcantly decreased, and the dominating decay mode becomes the mode to two
gluons. Also in this region of the parameter space the branching to two photons is signiﬁcantly
increased. Such a property could be easily understood from the structure of the interaction
vertices of the radion-dominated state and the SM fermions and gauge bosons (see the Feynman
rules in [13]). Indeed all the vertices for the fermions and massive gauge bosons contain the
factor cos θ−c·sin θ
v , which becomes very small for sin θ close to v/Λr. This occurs due
to the cancellation of the contributions to the vertices coming from the SM type part of the
interactions and the part coming from the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. In contrast,
the interaction vertices of the radion-dominated state and the massless gluons and photons
have anomaly enhanced contributions and the mentioned cancellation does not take place for

small values of the parameter sin θ close to v/Λr. The corresponding cancellation occurs for the
gluon-gluon and photon-photon vertices at much larger values of the parameter sin θ, where the
branching ratios have minima as can be seen in Fig. 1. One should mention that the position of
the maximum value for the gluon and photon decay modes goes to smaller and smaller values
of sin θ with the increase of the scale parameter Λr. The position of the maximum as well
as the form of the curves close to the maximum practically does not depend on the value of
the parameter c, which accumulates the contributions of the higher KK scalar modes. The
dependence on the parameter c for two diﬀerent values of this parameter is demonstrated in
Fig. 2 showing the gluon-gluon and photon-photon branchings as functions of sin θ.

Fig. 3 illustrates the behavior of the total width of the radion-dominated state. The deep
minimum corresponds exactly to the discussed region, where all the leading decay modes dras-
tically go down. For a particular choice of the parameters Λr = 2 TeV and c = cmax the width
in the minimum becomes as small as 6 · 10−2 GeV. However, for the values of the parameter
sin θ away from the minimum region the width can be signiﬁcantly larger reaching a few tens
or even a hundred GeV. In the two-dimensional plot (see Fig. 4) the lines of equal width values
are shown depending on the parameters sin θ and Λr. The plot demonstrates that the radion-
dominated state can be rather wide. The width of the 750 GeV excess observed at the LHC
has a rather large value of the order of 45 GeV [1, 2].

However, a crucial point for the possible interpretation is the production cross section,
which should be in the range from a few to 10 fb. The production cross section for the radion-
dominated state is shown in Fig. 5. We have included the contributions of all the production
channels for the radion-dominated state (ggF, VBF, rV, rtt) with the decay to two photons.
We have included the NNLO K-factors taken from the Higgs cross section working group web
page ([19, 20]). One can see that, as expected, the gluon-gluon fusion dominates the production
cross section in the most interesting region of the parameter space, where the cross section has a

maximum. The maximum occurs for the same values of parameters, for which the corresponding
gg and γγ decay branching ratios have the maximum. As for the branching ratios in the range
close to the maximum, the cross section depends very weakly on the the parameter c. Such a
dependence is signiﬁcant for rather large mixing angles, where the cross section becomes much
smaller (see Fig. 6).

One should note that the parameter region allowed by the signal strength measurements
for 125 GeV boson at 8 TeV LHC energy and presented in Fig. 7 includes the above men-
tioned region, where the two-photon cross section has a maximum. The inclusion of the new
measurements at 13 TeV for the 125 GeV boson and the 750 GeV possible resonance into the
overall ﬁt leads to a minor modiﬁcation of the allowed region of the model parameter space as
demonstrated in Fig. 8.

However, the interpretation of the observed excess as the radion-dominated state is very
problematic or even impossible in the simplest variant of the discussed brane-world models,
where only the gravitational degrees of freedom are allowed to propagate in the bulk. Indeed,
as one can see in Fig. 6, the cross section has a maximum of about 0.14 fb, which is by a factor
of 50 ÷ 100 smaller than what is needed to achieve the observed level of the cross section for
the 750 GeV excess. In other areas of the parameter space the production cross section gets
even smaller as one can see in Fig. 9, where equal value contours for the cross section are shown.
Thus, one has to conclude that in the simplest variant of the model under consideration,
where only the gravitational and stabilizing scalar ﬁelds propagate in the bulk, the observed
excess cannot be understood as a radion-dominated resonance. This is in accord with the
results of paper [21], where the production and two-photon decay of a heavy radion-dominated
state was considered in the unstabilized RS model with the Higgs-curvature term and the SM
ﬁelds on the brane. As we have mentioned in Section 2, our eﬀective Lagrangian (13) for
small values of the parameter c gives the same coupling of the radion-dominated state to the

contribution to the amplitude.

In order to increase the two-photon signal rate some other heavy particles should propagate
in the gluon-gluon-scalar and photon-photon-scalar loop vertices, the scalar in our case being
the Higgs-dominated or the radion-dominated states. Such heavy particles in brane-world
models could be the excited KK states of those SM ﬁelds, which are also allowed to propagate
in the multidimensional bulk. The contribution of the bulk ﬁeld excitations to the production
cross section of a heavy radion-dominated state with mass up to 350 GeV was discussed in
paper [21]. It was shown there that it can increase the cross section up to 10 fb, although it
is not quite clear, whether this result can be extrapolated to the 750 GeV radion-dominated
state. In fact, in paper [5] it is claimed that the bulk ﬁeld excitations in the Randall-Sundrum
background can really give the necessary enhancement of the production cross section of this
state. However, the calculation of the excited state contributions in stabilized brane-world
models is not straightforward, in particular because of the excited state impact on the energy
momentum tensor, and needs a special thorough investigation.

4 Conclusions

In the present paper we have studied the possibility of interpreting the 750 GeV diphoton
excess that has been recently presented by the LHC as the production of a radion-dominated
state in a stabilized brane-world model. The Higgs-dominated state is ﬁxed to be the 125 GeV
boson. For our investigation we used a very general eﬀective Lagrangian that describes the
low-energy interactions of the scalar mixed states in the Standard model extended by a scalar
singlet including the remaining contributions from the integrated out possible tower of heavier
scalar states. Our calculations show that although one can rather well ﬁt the signal strengths

9

in a certain region of the model parameter space, the resulting two-photon production cross
section is 50÷100 smaller than what is needed to achieve the observed level of the cross section.
This means that the stabilized brane-world models with only gravity and the Goldberger-Wise
ﬁeld propagating in the bulk, as well as the other models described by special cases of the
considered eﬀective Lagrangian, are unable to explain the excess.
