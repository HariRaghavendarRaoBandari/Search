ABSTRACT
The MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov) telescopes ob-
served the BL Lac object H1722+119 (redshift unknown) for six consecutive nights
between 2013 May 17 and 22, for a total of 12.5 h. The observations were triggered
by high activity in the optical band measured by the KVA (Kungliga Vetenskap-
sakademien) telescope. The source was for the ﬁrst time detected in the very high
energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) γ-ray band with a statistical signiﬁcance of 5.9 σ. The
integral ﬂux above 150 GeV is estimated to be (2.0 ± 0.5) per cent of the Crab Nebula
ﬂux. We used contemporaneous high energy (HE, 100 MeV < E < 100 GeV) γ-ray
observations from Fermi-LAT (Large Area Telescope) to estimate the redshift of the
source. Within the framework of the current extragalactic background light models,
we estimate the redshift to be z = 0.34 ± 0.15. Additionally, we used contemporaneous
X-ray to radio data collected by the instruments on board the Swift satellite, the KVA,
and the OVRO (Owens Valley Radio Observatory) telescope to study multifrequency
characteristics of the source. We found no signiﬁcant temporal variability of the ﬂux
in the HE and VHE bands. The ﬂux in the optical and radio wavebands, on the other
hand, did vary with diﬀerent patterns. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of
H1722+119 shows surprising behaviour in the ∼ 3 × 1014 − 1018 Hz frequency range. It
can be modelled using an inhomogeneous helical jet synchrotron self-Compton model.

1 INTRODUCTION

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are the most luminous persis-
tent sources of electromagnetic radiation in the Universe.
They are compact regions in the centres of galaxies formed
around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that actively
accrete matter. Approximately 10 per cent of AGN eject
matter through relativistic jets (Dunlop et al. 2003). AGN
whose jets are oriented close to the line of sight to the Earth
are referred to as blazars. Jets are sources of electromag-
netic radiation of all wavelengths from radio to γ-rays. They
can extend to Mpc distances from the nucleus and can be
brighter than the rest of the galaxy. The spectral energy
distribution (SED) of blazars is characterised by two broad
peaks: a “low-energy” peak in the optical to X-ray band
and a “high-energy” peak in the X-ray to γ-ray band. Their
emission is characterised by the strong and variable linear
polarisation in the optical and radio bands, and high vari-
ability in ﬂux across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
Blazars can be divided into two classes according to the
characteristics of their emission: ﬂat spectrum radio quasars
(FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs). FSRQs are
known to have prominent broad and narrow optical emis-
sion lines, in addition to strong optical and X-ray contin-
uum emission. A quite common feature is the so-called blue
bump in the optical-UV band associated with the emission
from the accretion disc. BL Lacs, on the other hand exhibit
very weak optical emission lines if any at all. The low-energy
peak in SED of FSRQs is believed to be a combination of
synchrotron radiation of electrons in the jet and thermal
emission from the broad line region (BLR), dust torus and

accretion disc, while usually in the case of BL Lacs, all the
emission is attributed to synchrotron emission. According
to leptonic scenarios, the second peak is a result of inverse
Compton (IC) scattering of lower-energy photons (so-called
seed photons) on relativistic electrons within the jet, while
hadronic scenarios assume protons in the jet are accelerated
even to energies >
∼ 1019 eV and signiﬁcantly contribute to
the emission either through proton-synchrotron emission in
relatively strong magnetic ﬁelds, or photo-pion production
(B¨ottcher et al. 2013). Ghisellini et al. (2010) showed that
the broad-band SEDs of γ-ray blazars can be, on average,
well described by a simple one-zone leptonic model including
synchrotron and IC emission components, with the addition
of possible external contributions from e.g. the accretion disc
or host galaxy emission.

H1722+119 was ﬁrst observed in the 1970s as a part
of the Uhuru X-ray sky survey and the HEAO 1 Large
Area Sky Survey (LASS). The resulting X-ray source cat-
alogues (Forman et al. (1978); source name: 4U1722+11,
and Wood et al. (1984); source name: 1H1720+117) only
identify it as an X-ray source. Almost twenty years later,
Griﬃths et al. (1989) and Brissenden et al. (1990) inde-
pendently, classiﬁed it as a BL Lac object. Furthermore,
H1722+119 was classiﬁed as an intermediate-energy-peaked
BL Lac with the low-energy peak at νs = 6.3 × 1015 Hz
(Nieppola et al. 2006). Brissenden et al. (1990) measured a
very high level of linear polarization in the optical band,
reaching 17.6 ± 1.0 per cent in the B band. H1722+119 has
been observed in the radio band by the OVRO (Owens Val-
ley Radio Observatory) since 2007 (Richards et al. 2011)1.
H1722+119 is included in the third Fermi-LAT (Large
Area Telescope) catalogue (3FGL; Acero et al. 2015) as a
counterpart of the γ-ray source 3FGL J1725.0+1152, with
photon index Γ = 1.89 ± 0.05 and 0.1–100 GeV ﬂux of

(2.7 ± 0.3) × 10−8 ph cm−2 s−1. Interesting studies, in which
radio and high energy (HE, 100 MeV < E < 100 GeV) γ-ray
properties of blazars and their correlations are discussed,
were presented in Lister et al. (2011) and Linford et al.
(2012). Both works used the LAT on board the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope for HE γ-ray and the Very
Long Baseline Array for radio observations. Linford et al.
(2012) (source name: F17250+1151) describe H1722+119 as
a compact source with a short jet. Infrared (IR) observa-
tions of H1722+119 were performed as part of the Two Mi-
cron All-Sky Survey (Mao 2011). H1722+119 was listed as
a candidate TeV blazar in Costamante & Ghisellini (2002)
based on its X-ray and radio properties. Observations in
the very high energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) γ-ray band
were ﬁrst reported in Aleksi´c et al. (2011, source name: RX
J1725.0+1152). The MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma-
ray Imaging Cherenkov) telescope observed H1722+119 be-
tween 2005 and 2009 together with 20 other BL Lac can-
didates. H1722+119 was selected for this campaign based
on its X-ray properties from Donato et al. (2001). The
stacked sample of observed blazars showed a signal above
100 GeV with a signiﬁcance of 4.9 σ, but the analysis of
H1722+119 data alone resulted in 1.4 σ after 32 h of ob-
servation, with an upper limit (UL) of ﬂux above 140 GeV
of 1.3 × 10−11 ph cm−2 s−1.

Although Brissenden et al. (1990) reported a feature-
less optical spectrum, Griﬃths et al. (1989) estimated the
redshift of the host galaxy based on an absorption feature
to be z = 0.018. However, this result was not conﬁrmed by
other optical observations (e.g. V´eron-Cetty & V´eron 1993;
Falomo et al. 1993, 1994). Sbarufatti et al. (2006) observed
H1722+119 with the ESO Very Large Telescope and de-
tected no intrinsic features in the optical spectra. They de-
rived a lower limit (LL) of z > 0.17. Landoni et al. (2014)
used the spectrograph X-Shooter at the European Southern
Observatory Very Large Telescope to set a LL on the red-
shift at 0.35. They detected no intrinsic or intervening spec-
tral lines, ascribing this to extreme optical beaming, setting
the ratio of beamed to thermal emission at ≥ 400. Farina
et al. (2013, priv. comm.) observed H1722+119 with the
NOTCam of the Nordic Optical Telescope in the H-band in
2013 and were unable to detect the host galaxy. Applying
the imaging redshift technique proposed by Sbarufatti et al.
(2005), they set a LL on redshift at 0.4.

In this paper we report the ﬁrst detection of VHE γ-
ray emission from H1722+119, by the MAGIC telescopes
(Cortina 2013), and study the multifrequency characteris-
tics of H1722+119 in that period. Emission from blazars is
quite variable in time, and optical high states are often used
to trigger MAGIC observations. H1722+119 joins quite a
long list of blazars, whose VHE γ-ray signal was detected
following an optical high state (see e.g. Albert et al. 2006,
2007b, 2008b; Anderhub et al. 2009; Aleksi´c et al. 2012b,c,
2014, 2015). In Section 2 we present the instruments used in
this work and their respective results. Section 3 is reserved
for study of multifrequency characteristics. We summarise
our ﬁndings in Section 4. Throughout the paper, we assume
standard ΛCDM cosmology (Komatsu et al. 2011).

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS

2.1 MAGIC

The MAGIC telescopes are located at the Observatorio del
Roque de los Muchachos in the Canary Island of La Palma,
Spain (28◦45′ north, 18◦54′ west), at 2200 m above sea level.
Two 17 m diameter Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Tele-
scopes are optimised for observations of γ-rays of energies
above 50 GeV. A detailed overview of the MAGIC experi-
ment and the telescope performance is given in Aleksi´c et al.
(2016a,b).

The results reported here are based on the observa-
tions performed during six nights between 2013 May 17
and 22, triggered by the high optical state detected by
the KVA (Kungliga Vetenskaps Akademientelescope) (see
Section 2.4). Between the ﬁrst (2005–2009) and the sec-
ond (2013) observation campaign the MAGIC system un-
derwent a series of major upgrades (see Cortina et al. 2005;
Albert et al. 2008a; Goebel et al. 2008; Aleksi´c et al. 2012a;
Sitarek et al. 2013; Aleksi´c et al. 2016a,b). The current in-
strument is roughly twice as sensitive in the 100 − 200 GeV
energy range compared to the single MAGIC I telescope in
operation in 2009 (Aleksi´c et al. 2016b).

MAGIC usually observes sources in the so called wobble
mode (Fomin et al. 1994; Aleksi´c et al. 2016b). H1722+119
was observed in four false-source positions for a total of
12.5 h during 2013. After quality selection based on the sta-
bility of the event rates, the eﬀective time amounted to
12.0 h. Observations were performed at zenith angles be-
tween 16◦ and 37◦.

The data were analysed within the MARS (MAGIC
Analysis and Reconstruction Software) analysis framework
(Lombardi et al. 2011; Zanin et al. 2013). The VHE γ-ray
signal is estimated using the distribution of the squared
angular distance (θ2) between the reconstructed and nom-
inal (ON-source) source positions in the camera coordi-
nates for each event. Background is estimated in the same
manner with respect to the OFF-source position. Usually
three OFF-source positions are chosen at the same dis-
tance from the camera centre as the ON-source position
and rotated by 90◦ each. Non is the number of events orig-
inating within the source region (θ2 < 0.0125 deg2), and
Noﬀ the normalised number of all events from the same
region around OFF-source positions. An excess of 337.5
events above 60 GeV with respect to the background was de-
tected, yielding a signal signiﬁcance of 5.9 σ using Eq. 17 of
Li & Ma (1983). The θ2 distribution is shown in Fig. 1. The
light curve of the integral VHE γ-ray ﬂux above 150 GeV
is shown in Fig. 2. There is no evidence of ﬂux variabil-
ity on a night-by-night basis. A ﬁt with a constant ﬂux of
(6.3±1.6)×10−12 ph cm−2 s−1 resulted in χ2/N DF = 3.5/5,
where N DF stands for number of degrees of freedom. This
is equivalent to (2.0 ± 0.5) per cent of the Crab Nebula
VHE γ-ray ﬂux. The measured ﬂux is consistent with the
UL set by the MAGIC observations of H1722+119 from
the previous campaign (Aleksi´c et al. 2011). The diﬀeren-
tial energy spectrum was reconstructed using the Forward
Unfolding algorithm presented in Albert et al. (2007a). It
can be described by a simple power law function dN/dE =
f0(E/E0)−Γ with normalization f0 = (4.3 ± 0.9stat ±
0.9syst) × 10−11 ph cm−2 s−1 TeV−1 and a photon index Γ =
3.3±0.3stat ±0.2syst, at normalization energy E0 = 200 GeV.

The ﬁt resulted in (χ2/N DF = 3.6/8). The systematic un-
certainty of the photon index was estimated to be ±0.2, us-
ing Eq. 3 of Aleksi´c et al. (2016b). We estimate the error on
the f0 to be 20 per cent, which does not include the energy
scale uncertainty estimated to be 17 per cent.

2.2 Fermi-LAT

The Fermi-LAT is a pair-conversion telescope operating
from 20 MeV to > 300 GeV. Details about the Fermi-LAT
are given in Atwood et al. (2009). The LAT data reported
in this paper were collected from 2013 January 1 (MJD
56293) to December 31 (MJD 56657). During this time,
the Fermi observatory operated almost entirely in survey
mode. The analysis was performed with the ScienceTools

software package version v9r32p5. Only Pass 7 reprocessed
events belonging to the ‘Source’ class were used. The time
intervals when the rocking angle of the LAT was greater
than 52◦ were rejected. In addition, a cut on the zenith
angle (< 100◦) was applied to reduce contamination from
the Earth limb γ rays, which are produced by cosmic rays
interacting with the upper atmosphere. The spectral anal-
ysis was performed with the instrument response function
P7REP_SOURCE_V15 using an unbinned maximum-likelihood
method implemented in the tool gtlike in the 0.1−100 GeV
energy range. Isotropic (iso_source_v05.txt) and Galactic
diﬀuse emission (gll_iem_v05_rev1.fit) components were
used to model the background2. The normalizations of both
components were allowed to vary freely during the spectral
ﬁtting.

We analysed a region of interest of 10◦ radius centred at
the location of H1722+119. We evaluated the signiﬁcance of
the γ-ray signal from the source by means of the maximum-
likelihood test statistic TS = 2 (logL1 - logL0), where L
is the likelihood of the data given the model with (L1) or
without (L0) a point source at the position of H1722+119
(e.g. Mattox et al. 1996). The source model used in gtlike
includes all sources from the 3FGL catalogue that fall within
15◦ of the source. A ﬁrst maximum-likelihood analysis was
performed to remove from the model the sources having TS
< 10 and/or the predicted number of counts based on the
ﬁtted model Npred < 3. A second maximum-likelihood anal-
ysis was performed on the updated source model. In the
ﬁtting procedure, the normalization factors and the photon
indices of the sources lying within 10◦ of H1722+119 were
left as free parameters. For the sources located between 10◦
and 15◦ from our target, we kept the normalization and the
photon index ﬁxed to the values from the 3FGL catalogue.
All uncertainties in measured HE γ-ray ﬂux reported
throughout this paper are statistical only. The systematic
uncertainty in the ﬂux is dominated by the systematic uncer-
tainty in the eﬀective area (Ackermann et al. 2012), which
amounts to 5–10 per cent in the 0.1–100 GeV energy range,
and therefore smaller than the typical statistical uncertain-
ties for this analysis3.

Integrating over the period 2013 January 1 – Decem-
ber 31 in the 0.1–100 GeV energy range, using a power law
model as in the 3FGL catalogue, the ﬁt yielded a TS = 335,
with an average ﬂux of (4.1 ± 0.7) ×10−8 ph cm−2 s−1, and
a photon index of Γ = 1.99 ± 0.08 at the decorrelation en-
ergy E0 = 3063 MeV. During the same period, the ﬁt with
a log-parabola model, dN/dE ∝ (E/E0)−α−β log(E/E0), in
the 0.1–100 GeV energy range results in TS = 355, with
a spectral slope α = 1.99 ± 0.08, and a curvature param-
eter β = 0.01 ± 0.01, indicating no signiﬁcant curvature
of the γ-ray spectrum. The LAT light curve and the pho-
ton index evolution with 2-month time bins is shown in
Fig. 3. The 2-month bin width is a trade-oﬀ between the
signiﬁcance of the source (TS > 25 in each time bin) and
the shortest time-scale to be probed. For each time bin, the
spectral parameters for H1722+119 and for all the sources
within 10◦ from the target were left free to vary. No sig-
niﬁcant increase of the γ-ray activity was observed by LAT

trum also with a log-parabola model, obtaining a spectral
slope α = 2.2 ± 0.1, a curvature parameter of β = 0.54+0.34
−0.31,
and a χ2
red/N DF = 1.124/63. The F-test shows an im-
provement of the ﬁt with respect to the simple power law
(χ2
red/N DF = 1.245/64) with a probability of 99.9 per cent.
UVOT data in the v, b, u, w1, m2, and w2 ﬁl-
ters were reduced with the HEAsoft package v6.16 exe-
cuting the aperture-photometry task uvotsource. We ex-
tracted the source counts from an aperture of 5′′ cen-
tred on the source, and the background counts from a cir-
cle with 10 arcsec radius in a nearby source-free region.
Magnitudes were converted into dereddened ﬂux densities
by adopting the extinction value E(B–V) = 0.1497 from
Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011), the mean Galactic extinction
curve in Fitzpatrick (1999) and the magnitude-ﬂux calibra-
tions by Bessell & Brett (1988). The UVOT ﬂux densities
collected in 2013 are reported in Fig. 3. The ﬂux densities
observed in 2008 May 31 are a factor of 2 lower with respect
to the 2013 observations.

Checking the source SED (Fig. 5), we noticed that a
monotonic connection between optical-UV and X-ray spec-
trum was not possible, which motivated us to analyse possi-
ble sources of errors aﬀecting the data. An aperture correc-
tion procedure was executed for the 2013 May 20 UVOT im-
ages in all ﬁlters, estimating from ﬁeld stars the correction
to magnitudes extracted with full-width at half maximum
(FWHM) radius circular apertures to obtain the counts
within the standard apertures (5′′ radii). A ﬁrst photom-
etry of the object with apertures of 2.5′′ (the FWHM for all
ﬁlters) was executed. Then 6 to 8 non-saturated ﬁeld stars
were selected and photometry was performed for each of
them using FWHM radii and standard apertures, and non-
contaminated background annular regions of radii 26′′ to
33′′. The weighted mean among all magnitude diﬀerences
obtained with the two diﬀerent apertures was calculated
and ﬁnally subtracted from the object magnitude at FWHM
apertures. Results are however compatible with the standard
procedure, with a low ﬂux in the w1 ﬁlter. Another check
was required because the source colour, b − v ∼ 0.7, is out
of the range to which the average count rate to ﬂux ratios
(CFR) estimated by Breeveld et al. (2011) are applicable.
Therefore, we explored UVOT calibration issues following
the procedure described in Raiteri et al. (2010). We ﬁt the
source spectrum with a power law and convolved it with
the ﬁlter eﬀective areas and appropriate physical quantities
to derive source-dependent eﬀective wavelengths (EW) and
CFR. However, the results obtained are very similar to those
given by Breeveld et al., the largest variations being an in-
crease of the EW by 2 and 3 per cent in the w1 and w2
band, respectively, and of the CFR by 4 per cent in w1.
More signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found when comparing the
convolved Galactic extinction values with those obtained by
simply evaluating them at the ﬁlter EW. We obtained a 7 per
cent decrease of the extinction in the w2 and m2 bands, and
an 8 per cent increase in the w1 band. The optical part of the
SED remained essentially unchanged after the re-calibration
procedure. The results after the re-calibration procedure are
shown in Fig. 5.

in 2013 May and June – the time bin contemporaneous to
the MAGIC observations. Both the ﬂux and the photon
index are well ﬁtted by a constant with the following pa-
rameters: ﬂux: p0 = (3.43 ± 0.56) × 10−8 ph cm−2 s−1 and
χ2/N DF = 3.87/5, photon index: Γ = 1.96 ± 0.07 and
χ2/N DF = 1.68/5. Leaving the photon index free to vary
during 2013 May, we obtained TS = 37, with an average
ﬂux of (8.5±3.3)×10−9 ph cm−2 s−1, and a photon index of
Γ = 1.4 ± 0.3. The hint of hardening of the LAT spectrum
may be an indication of the shift of the IC peak to higher
energies during the MAGIC detection. By considering only
the period May 13–26, including the MAGIC observation
period, the maximum-likelihood analysis results in a TS =
15, with a ﬂux of (0.9 ± 0.4) × 10−8 ph cm−2 s−1 (assuming
Γ = 1.4). By means of the gtsrcprob tool, we estimated
that the highest energy photon emitted from H1722+119
(with probability > 90 per cent of being associated with
the source) was observed on 2013 April 28 (MJD 54610),
with an energy of 65.7 GeV. Another photon with an energy
51.6 GeV was observed on 2013 December 31 (MJD 56657).

2.3 Swift

The Swift satellite (Gehrels et al. 2004) performed three ob-
servations of H1722+119 on 2008 May 31, 2013 January
15 and May 20. The observations were carried out with
all three on board instruments: the X-ray Telescope (XRT;
Burrows et al. 2005, 0.2–10.0 keV), the Ultraviolet/Optical
Telescope (UVOT; Roming et al. 2005, 170–600 nm) and the
Burst Alert Telescope (BAT; Barthelmy et al. 2005, 15–150
keV). The hard X-ray ﬂux of this source is below the sensi-
tivity of the BAT instrument for the short exposure of these
observations (see Table 1), therefore the data from this in-
strument are not included in this work. Moreover, the source
is not present in the Swift/BAT 70-month hard X-ray cata-
logue (Baumgartner et al. 2013).

The XRT data were processed with standard proce-
dures (xrtpipeline v0.12.8), ﬁltering, and screening cri-
teria using the HEAsoft package (v6.14). The data were col-
lected in photon counting (PC) mode on 2008 May 31 and
2013 January 15, and windowed timing (WT) mode on 2013
May 20. The source count rate in PC mode was low (<
0.5 counts s−1); thus pile-up correction was not required.
Source events were extracted from a circular region with a
radius of 20 pixels (1 pixel = 2.36 arcsec), while background
events were extracted from a circular region with a radius
of 50 pixels in PC mode and 20 pixels in WT mode away
from the source region and from other bright sources. An-
cillary response ﬁles were generated with xrtmkarf, and ac-
count for diﬀerent extraction regions, vignetting and point-
spread function corrections. We used the spectral redistri-
bution matrices in the Calibration data base maintained
by HEASARC. We ﬁtted the spectrum with an absorbed
power law using the photoelectric absorption model tbabs
(Wilms et al. 2000), with a neutral hydrogen column den-
sity ﬁxed to its Galactic value (NH = 8.88 × 1020 cm−2;
Kalberla et al. 2005). We noted that the X-ray ﬂux of
the source observed in 2013, i.e. (1–2)×10−11 erg cm−2 s−1
(Fig. 3), is a factor between 3 and 5 higher than the ﬂux
in 2008 May 31, (3.6 ± 0.7) × 10−12 erg cm−2 s−1, with no
signiﬁcant spectral change (Table 1). For the observation
in 2013 May 20, with the higher statistics, we ﬁt the spec-

2.4 KVA

The KVA telescope is located at the Observatorio del Roque
de los Muchachos, La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain), and is
operated by the Tuorla Observatory, Finland4. The telescope
consists of a 0.6-m f/15 Cassegrain devoted to polarimetry,
and a 0.35-m f/11 Schmidt-Cassegrain auxiliary telescope for
multicolour photometry. The telescope has been successfully
operated remotely since the fall of 2003. The KVA is used
for optical support observations for MAGIC by making R-
band photometric observations, typically one measurement
per night per source.
H1722+119 has been regularly monitored by the KVA since
2005. At the beginning of May 2013, after an extended op-
tical high state, the source reached an R-band magnitude of
14.65 (ﬂux of 5.96±0.09 mJy), which constituted a historical
maximum for this source at that time5. The high emission
state triggered observations by MAGIC, but the MAGIC ob-
servations started during the decreasing part of the optical
ﬂaring activity. The KVA observed nightly light curve for
2013 is shown in Fig. 3. The ﬂux varied signiﬁcantly, the
ratio between the highest and lowest ﬂux being 1.6, but we
saw no regularity in this variation.
The data were reduced by the Tuorla Observatory Team as
described in Nilsson et al. (2016, in prep.). The data were
corrected for Galactic extinction using the total absorption
Aλ = 0.374 mag from Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011).

2.5 OVRO

The 40-m radio telescope at the OVRO observes at the 15
GHz band. In late 2007, it started regular monitoring of
a sample of blazars in order to support the goals of the
Fermi-LAT telescope (Richards et al. 2011). This monitor-
ing program includes about 1800 known or potential γ-
ray-loud blazars, including all candidate γ-ray blazar sur-
vey (CGRaBS; Healey et al. 2008) sources above declination
−20◦. The sources in this program are observed in total in-
tensity twice per week with a 4 mJy (minimum) and 3 per
cent (typical) uncertainty on the ﬂux density. Observations
are performed with a dual-beam (each 2.5 arcmin full-width
half-maximum) Dicke-switched system using cold sky in the
oﬀ-source beam as the reference. Additionally, the source is
switched between beams to reduce atmospheric variations.
The absolute ﬂux density scale is calibrated using observa-
tions of 3C 286, adopting the ﬂux density (3.44 Jy) from
Baars et al. (1977). This results in about a 5 per cent abso-
lute scale uncertainty, which is not reﬂected in the plotted

The OVRO nightly light curve for 2013 is shown in Fig. 3.
Although there is some indication of a short time vari-
ability, we ﬁtted the whole sample with a linear function
(F [Jy] = p0 + p1 × (t − 56300)[MJD]) to point out the
general trend of increasing ﬂux. The ﬁt parameters are
p0 = (5.2 ± 0.2) × 10−2 Jy, p1 = (1.07 ± 0.10) × 10−4 Jy/day
and χ2/N DF = 39.68/36. We also considered the possibility
of a constant ﬂux, but that assumption was discarded with
χ2/N DF = 146.9/37 (p = 5 × 10−15).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Redshift and the intrinsic VHE γ-ray

spectrum

VHE γ-rays can be absorbed by the extragalactic back-
ground light (EBL), through photon-photon interactions,
resulting in e+e− pair-production. The ﬂux attenuation is
directly dependent on the redshift of the source and en-
ergy of γ-rays. A redshift-estimation method described in
Prandini et al. (2010) uses this fact. It relies on the as-
sumption that both HE and VHE γ-rays are created by
the same physical processes and in the same region, and
that the intrinsic spectrum in the VHE range cannot be
harder than the spectrum in the HE range. The method
uses only the spectral slope of the HE range data. The
VHE γ-ray spectrum was de-absorbed using the EBL model
from Franceschini et al. (2008). Because spectral points ob-
tained by the MAGIC telescopes at energies below 100 GeV
are usually aﬀected by larger systematic uncertainties, they
are not used for the ﬁt of the VHE spectrum. The re-
constructed redshift is obtained by applying a simple em-
pirical formula to the value estimated from de-absorption.
Applying this method to the MAGIC and contemporane-
ous (2013 May; MJD 56413 – 56442) Fermi-LAT data we
obtained the reconstructed redshift of H1722+119 to be
z = 0.34 ± 0.15stat ± 0.05meth, the error marked as meth
being a result of the method as described in Prandini et al.
(2010). The UL on the redshift was set to 1.06 for the 95
per cent conﬁdence level. Applying the log likelihood ra-
tio test to set the UL, as described in e.g. Mazin & Goebel
(2007), we obtained a value of 0.95. When de-absorbed for
redshift values greater than 0.95, the spectrum shape be-
comes parabolic in a log(dN/dE) vs log E representation,
with apparent minimum at ≈ 200 GeV. Our reconstructed
redshift value is in agreement with the latest Landoni et al.
(2014) and Farina et al. (2013) results. We used our result
combined with the LL from Farina et al. (z > 0.4) to de-
absorb the VHE γ-ray ﬂux. For z = 0.4, and using the EBL
model from Franceschini et al. (2008), we found the parame-

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2016)

ters of the intrinsic (EBL-deabsorbed) VHE spectrum to be
f0 = (9.6 ± 2.2) × 10−11 ph cm−2 s−1 TeV−1, Γ = 2.3 ± 0.4,
χ2/N DF = 3.1/8.

3.2 Multifrequency light curve

As already mentioned in Section 2.4, MAGIC observations
were triggered by an extended optical high state, which was
the historical R-band maximum at that time. The VHE γ-
ray ﬂux (Fig. 2) is compatible with a constant ﬂux and the
previously established UL based on combined data taken
over several years. None the less, we cannot reach a ﬁrm
conclusion on whether the source was ﬂaring in the VHE γ-
rays during MAGIC observations or not. Observations per-
formed during six consecutive nights were not suﬃcient to
study a longer term variability. However, we compared the
HE γ-ray light curve for the entire year to the optical light
curve over period 2013 March 22 to October 05, and the
radio light curve over period 2013 January 21 to October
05. The Fermi-LAT data were divided into 2-month time
bins with the photon index left free to vary (Fig. 3), while
each point in the KVA and OVRO light curves represents a
single measurement. Comparison of ﬂuxes for the entire pe-
riod of collected data revealed that the OVRO data show an
obvious trend of increasing ﬂux on a time-scale of one year
(dashed line in the bottom panel of Fig. 3), while the HE
γ-ray ﬂux was consistent with being constant, and the op-
tical ﬂux varied with no apparent regularity. Therefore, we
cannot claim any connection between emissions in diﬀerent
energy bands.

3.3 SED modelling

The SED for 2013 May is shown in Fig. 5. Only data con-
temporaneous to MAGIC observations have been considered
for modelling the SED for 2013. On 2013 May 22 (MJD
56434), one observation was performed by the OVRO at 15
GHz. The Swift data collected on 2013 May 20 (MJD 56432)
were considered, and the R-band observation by the KVA
from the same night was used to obtain a spectral point
at 4.56 × 1014 Hz. The Fermi-LAT spectrum was calculated
in the period 2013 May 1 – June 30. The MAGIC spectral
points were obtained with Schmelling’s method as described
in Albert et al. (2007a). Based on the arguments discussed
in Section 3.1, we adopted a value for redshift of 0.4, and
EBL model from Franceschini et al. (2008) to get the intrin-
sic VHE part of the spectrum. We also show the Swift data
collected on 2008 May 31 (MJD 54617), in order to compare
the source SED during the two diﬀerent brightness states.
Archival data from the 2MASS (Two Micron All Sky Sur-
vey) All-Sky Catalog of Point Sources (Cutri et al. 2003)
and AllWISE (Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Survey Explorer) Data
Release (Cutri & et al. 2013) are included to show the over-
all behaviour in the IR-optical band, however these were not
considered for modelling. We also show the near-IR and op-
tical spectral points from Landoni et al. (2014), which were
also not used for modelling.

The source SED shows surprising behaviour in the fre-
quency range ∼ 3 × 1014 − 1018 Hz. Indeed, the de-absorbed
(as described in Section 2.3) optical–UV spectrum appears
curved, with a peak in the b band and a steep slope in the

UV. H1722+119 is a bona ﬁde BL Lac type of source. None
of the observations used in this work, nor information found
in the literature revealed anything about the nature of the
black hole environment, nor the host galaxy. There is no ev-
idence of emission at any frequency from the accretion disc,
dust torus or BLR. In fact, Landoni et al. (2014) detected
no intrinsic or intervening spectral lines, and set the ratio of
beamed to thermal emission to be ≥ 400.

Therefore we do not expect the presence of thermal
emission from an accretion disc and the host galaxy that
can justify the shape of the optical–UV spectrum. More-
over, this shape prevents a monotonic connection with the
X-ray spectrum, as would be expected if both the optical–
UV and X-ray emissions were produced by a synchrotron
process in the same jet region. The connection between the
UV and X-ray spectrum in both states requires an inﬂection
point that is hard to reproduce with simple, one-zone mod-
els. This instead can easily be obtained in the framework of
a curved jet. Indeed, curved/helical geometries have often
been observed in blazar jets (see e.g. Villata & Raiteri 1999,
and references therein). A helical-jet morphology can arise
as the result of perturbations induced by orbital motion in a
binary black hole system or precession of the black hole spin
axis (Villata & Raiteri 1999, and references therein; Rieger
2004). 3-D magnetohydrodinamic (MHD) simulations by
Nakamura et al. (2001); Moll et al. (2008); Mignone et al.
(2010) show how kink instabilities lead to a wiggled, in par-
ticular helical, jet structure. MHD equilibrium of helical jets
was investigated by Villata & Ferrari (1995).

We adopted the helical jet model originally proposed
by Villata & Raiteri (1999) to explain the observed SED
variations of Mkn 501, and later applied also to other ob-
jects like S4 0954+65 (Raiteri et al. 1999), AO 0235+16
(Ostorero et al. 2004), BL Lacertae (Raiteri et al. 2009;
2010) and PG 1553+113 (Raiteri et al. 2015). The axis of
the helical-shaped jet is assumed to lie along the z-axis of
a 3-D reference frame. The pitch angle is ζ and ψ is the
angle deﬁned by the helix axis with the line of sight. The
non-dimensional length of the helical path can be expressed
in terms of the z coordinate along the helix axis:

l(z) =

z

cos ζ

,

0 ≤ z ≤ 1 ,

(1)

which corresponds to an azimuthal angle ϕ(z) = az, where
the angle a is a constant. The jet viewing angle varies along
the helical path as

cos θ(z) = cos ψ cos ζ + sin ψ sin ζ cos(φ − az) ,

(2)

where φ is the azimuthal diﬀerence between the line of sight
and the initial direction of the helical path. The jet is inho-
mogeneous: each slice of the jet can radiate, in the plasma
rest reference frame, synchrotron photons from a minimum
frequency ν ′
s,max, which follow the
laws:

where li are length scales, and i = min, max. The model
takes into account IC scattering of the synchrotron pho-
tons by the same relativistic electrons emitting them (i.e.
SSC). Consequently, each portion of the jet emitting syn-
chrotron radiation between ν ′
s,max(l) will also
produce IC radiation between ν ′

dimensionless, model used to describe blazar variability and
should not be interpreted as a physical model. However, ab-
solute dimensions can be derived by comparison with VLBA
images. In our model, the 15 GHz radio emission comes from
the outer 20 per cent of the jet (see Fig. 4). This is assumed
to be the jet region where the bulk of the observed 15 GHz
radiation comes from. The results of the MOJAVE program6
show that the size of the emitting core is . 0.1 pc. Therefore
the unit length in our model would correspond to a dimen-
sion of the order of one tenth of a parsec.

The helical jet model can produce reasonable ﬁts to the
source SEDs (see Fig. 5), although the model applied to
2008 data is only constrained by the synchrotron emission,
because there are no contemporaneous data in other energy
bands. The noticeable thing is that both ﬁts were obtained
with the same choice of model parameters (see Table 2), with
the exception of the angle φ, which changes from 25◦ to 31◦
when going from the high to the low state. This underlines
how variations of a few degrees in the viewing angle alone
may account for the observed ﬂux changes.

the distance along the helical jet axis z (whose unit length can

4 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

MAGIC detected VHE γ-radiation from BL Lac H1722+119
after observations were triggered by a high ﬂux in R-band
measured by the KVA. The MAGIC observations were per-
formed during six consecutive nights and show no ﬂux vari-
ability. No signiﬁcant increase of the activity was observed
at HE by Fermi-LAT in 2013 May neither on short time-
scales nor compared to the average 2013 ﬂux. An indication
of spectral hardening at HE in 2013 May might explain a
VHE γ-ray ﬂux high enough to be detected by the MAGIC
telescopes. Changes in ﬂux were signiﬁcant in optical and ra-
dio data. However, on a time-scale of a year, the radio ﬂux

where cs1, cs2, cc1, cc2 > 0. The observed ﬂux densities at
frequency ν coming from the whole emitting jet are obtained
by integrating over all the jet portions contributing to that
observed frequency (see Fig. 4). Therefore, the observed ﬂux
density at each frequency will in general diﬀer depending on
the emissivity and beaming of each contributing jet portion,
resulting in the overall shape of the SED.

The helical jet model is intended to be a geometrical,

Figure 5. The H1722+119 SED. Blue dots represents data
contemporaneous to MAGIC observations. The MAGIC mea-
sured data are shown by empty blue squares, while full blue
squares indicate the de-absorbed points using the EBL model
from Franceschini et al. (2008). Fermi-LAT data are shown by
dots, while arrows represent Fermi-LAT ULs. The Swift data in-
dicated by blue dots, were taken on 2013 May 20 (MJD 56432).
The KVA R-band point represented by a blue dot was taken on
the same night. The OVRO measurement represented by a blue
dot was taken on 2013 May 22 (MJD 56434). Red triangles show
the Swift data from 2008 May 31 (MJD 54617). The green solid
line in the 1014 −1015 Hz range indicates data from Landoni et al.
(2014), but they were not considered for the ﬁt. Archival data
from 2MASS and WISE are shown by empty grey circles, and
were not considered for the ﬁt. The blue long-dashed line indi-
cates ﬁts of the helical jet model to the 2013 data, while the ﬁt to
the 2008 data is indicated by the red dash-dot line. Both models
represent the intrinsic VHE emission. Only blue and red points
were considered for modelling.

of the HE ﬂux. Therefore, we cannot claim that the two com-
ponents originate from the same physical region. While the
radio ﬂux was highest towards the end of the year, the high-
est optical ﬂux was observed in April, followed by a quite
sudden drop, which did not occur in radio data.

The SED shows an interesting feature in the optical–UV
band. A break between the optical–UV parts of the spectrum
is clearly visible. It also prevents a smooth connection be-
tween optical, UV and X-ray bands. We proposed the helical
jet model from Villata & Raiteri (1999) to explain the ob-
served emission. We found that the diﬀerence between the
two states can be attributed to a change of a few degrees in
the jet orientation.

Further multifrequency observations will be crucial to
investigate in detail this new VHE emitting blazar and its
emission mechanisms.
