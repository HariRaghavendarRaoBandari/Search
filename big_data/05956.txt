Abstract. We give a complete description of the anti-involutions that preserve the
principal gradation of the algebra of matrix quantum pseudodiﬀerential operators and
we describe the Lie subalgebras of its minus ﬁxed points.

1. Introduction

The W -inﬁnity algebras naturally arise in various physical theories, such as conformal
ﬁeld theory, the theory of quantum Hall eﬀect, etc. The W1+∞ algebra, which is the
central extension of the Lie algebra D of diﬀerential operators on the circle, is the most
fundamental among these algebras. The representations of the Lie Algebra W1+∞ were
ﬁrst studied in [KR], where its irreducible quasiﬁnite highest weight representations were
characterized. At the end of that article, similar results were found for the central ex-
tension of the Lie algebra of quantum pseudo-diﬀerential operatos Sq, which contains as
a subalgebra the q−analogue of the Lie algebra ˆD , the algebra of all regular diﬀerence
operators on C×.

In [KWY], certain subalgebras of the Lie algebra D were considered, and it was shown
that there are, up to conjugation, two anti-involutions σ± on D, which preserve the
principal gradation. These results were extended to the matrix case in [BL01], where
a complete description of the anti-involutions of the algebra DN of the N × N matrix
diﬀerential operators on the circle preserving the principal Z-gradation was given.

Analogouly, in [BL05] it was shown that there is a family of anti-involutions σǫ,k on Sq
(ǫ = ±1, k ǫ Z), up to conjugation, preserving the principal gradation. The goal of this
paper is to extend these results to the matrix case, where the global image seems to be
richer and more complex.

The paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2 we give a complete description of the
anti-involutions of the algebra Sq,N of N × N quantum pseudodiﬀerential operators,
preserving the principal Z-gradation. We obtain, up to conjugation, two families of anti-
involutions that show quite diﬀerent results when n = N and n < N. To exhibit their
diﬀerences in detail, they are studied separately in Sect. 3 and 4 respectively. In Sect. 3
the anti-involutions give us two families S ǫ,r,N
q,N of Lie subalgebras (ǫ = ±1, r, k ǫ Z) ﬁxed
by −σǫ,r,N . Then we give a geometric realization of σǫ,r,N , concluding that S +,r,N
is a
subalgebra of Sq,N of orthogonal type and S −,r,N
is a subalgebra of Sq,N of symplectic
type. In Sect. 4, the families σǫ,n, with 1 ≤ n < N give us two families of Lie subalgebras
S ǫ,n
q,N (ǫ = ±1) ﬁxed by −σǫ,n. We give a geometric realization of σǫ,n, concluding that
S +,n
q,N is a subalgebra of Sq,N of type o(n, N − n) and S −,n
q,N is a subalgebra of Sq,N of
type osp(n, N − n).

2. Quantum Pseudo-Differential Operators

Conisder C[z, z−1] the Laurent polynomial algebra in one variable. We denote S a

q the
associative algebra of quantum pseudo-diﬀerential operators. Explicitly, let Tq denote the
operator on C[z, z−1] given by

Tqf (z) = f (qz),

where q ǫ C× = C\{0}. An element ofS a
q can be written as a linear combination of
operators of the form zkf (Tq), where f is a Laurent polynomial in Tq. The product in
S a

q is given by

(2.1)

(zmf (Tq))(zkg(Tq)) = zm+kf (qkTq)g(Tq).

Now let Sq denote the Lie algebra obtained from S a

q by taking the usual commutator.

Let S ′

q = [Sq, Sq]. It follows:

Sq = S ′

qM CT 0

q

(direct sum of ideals).

Let N be a positive integer. As of this point, we shall denote by M atN A the associative
algebra of all N × N matrices over an algebra A and Eij the standard basis of M atN C.
q ⊗ M atN C be the associative algebra of all quantum matrix pseudodif-

q,N = S a

Let S a

ferential operators,namely the operators on CN [z, z−1] of the form

(2.2)

E = ek(z)T k

q + ek−1(z)T k−1

q + · · · + e0(z), where ek(z) ǫ M atN C[z, z−1].

In a more useful notation, we write the pseudodiﬀerential operators as linear combi-
nations of elements of the form zkf (Tq)A, where f is a Laurent polynomial, k ǫ Z and
A ǫ M atN C. The product in S a

q,N is given by

(2.3)

(zmf (Tq)A)(zkg(Tq)B) = zm+kf (qkTq)g(Tq)AB.

Let Sq,N denote the Lie algebra obtained from S a

q,N with the bracket given by the

conmutator, namely:

(2.4)

[zmf (Tq)A, zkg(Tq)B] = zm+k(f (qkTq)g(Tq)AB − f (Tq)g(qmTq)BA).
q Eij (k ǫ Z, m ǫ Z+, i, j ǫ {1, · · · , N}) form a basis of Sq,N .

The elements zkT m
Deﬁne the weight on Sq,N by

(2.5)

wtzkf (Tq)Eij = kN + i − j.

This gives the principal Z -gradation of S a

q,N and Sq,N , the latter of which is given by

Sq,N,j. This allows the following triangular decomposition

Sq,N =Lj ǫ Z
where Sq,N,+ =Lj ǫ Z<0

As we intend to classify the anti-involutions of S a

q,N preserving its principal gradation,
we shall introduce some notation. For each n, 1 ≤ n ≤ N, deﬁne the permutation πn in

if i > n.

We deﬁne σ = σ±,B,c,n in S a

q,N by the following formulas:

(2.7)

σ(Eii) = Eπn(i),πn(i),

σ(zEii) = ±zEπn(i),πn(i)

σ(TqEii) = Bq−1+δi≤nT −1

Theorem 2.1. Let 1 ≤ n < N . σ = σ±,B,c,n deﬁned on generators by (2.7) extends to

The proof will mainly consist of several steps making use of the involutive property of

σ and the relations between the generators Ei,j.

q,N which preserves the principal Z-gradation is

KARINA BATISTELLI - CARINA BOYALLIAN

Proof. Fix i ǫ {1, · · · , N}.

Step 1 .

j=1(Ui,j(Tq))2Ej,j, so Ui,j(Tq) = U 2

Because σ should preserve the principal Z-gradation, we have σ(Ei,i) =PN
PN
ery i, j ǫ {1, ..., N}. We also know that Ei,i = σ2(Ei,i) = PN
1 = PN

j=1 Ui,j(Tq)Ej,j.
Given the involutive property of σ, we get σ(Ei,i) = σ(Ei,iEi,i) = σ(Ei,i)σ(Ei,i) =
i,j(Tq). Taking into consideration the positive and
negative degrees of these Laurent polynomials, we arrive at Ui,j(Tq) = ai,j, where ai,j
are constant elements such that a2
i,j = ai,j. This gives us ai,j = 0 or ai,j = 1 for ev-
k=1 aj,kEk,k. So,
j=1 ai,jaj,k for k 6= i. So, for each i there exists a unique ji
such that ai,ji = aji,i = 1 and ai,jaj,i = 0 for any j 6= ji. And ai,jaj,k = 0 for every j, i
and k 6= i. In particular, ai,jiaji,k = 0 for k 6= i, so aji,k = 0 for any k 6= i, obtaining that
σ(Ei,i) = Eji,ji. Due to the injectivity of σ, π(i) := ji is a permutation in SN , and since
σ is an involution, we have π2 = id.

j=1 ai,jaj,i and 0 = PN

j=1 ai,jPN

Step 2 .
Again, due to the fact that σ should preserve the principal Z-gradation, we may assume

j=1 Pi,j(Tq)Ej,j and σ(T −1

j=1 Hi,j(Tq)Ej,j. So,

that σ(TqEi,i) =PN

q Ei,i) =PN

σ(TqEi,i) = σ(TqEi,iEi,i) = σ(Ei,i)σ(TqEi,i)

= Eπ(i),π(i)  N
Xj=1

Pi,j(Tq)Ej,j!

= Pi,π(i)(Tq)Eπ(i),π(i).

Proceding similarly with σ(T −1

q Ei,i), we have

σ(T −1

q Ei,i) = Hi,π(i)(Tq)Eπ(i),π(i).

Combining these two equations, we have

Eπ(i),π(i) = σ(Ei,i) = σ(T −1
= σ(TqEi,i)σ(T −1
= Pi,π(i)(Tq)Hi,π(i)(Tq)Eπ(i),π(i)

q Ei,iTqEi,i)
q Ei,i)

So, 1 = Pi,π(i)(Tq)Hi,π(i)(Tq) and, as consecuence, they must be units of the Laurent
q and Hi,π(i)(Tq) =

polynomial ring. Therefore, we can assume Pi(Tq) := Pi,π(i)(Tq) = BiT ki

q Ei,i) is then determined by σ(TqEi,i).

, with Bi ǫ C× and ki ǫ Z. So, σ(T −1

i T −ki
Now, let us note that we can write T k

q Ei,i = T k−1

q Ei,iTqEi,i = · · · = (TqEi,i)k, for every

q

k ǫ Z. Therefore,

(2.9)

TqEi,i = σ2(TqEi,i) = σ(BiT ki

= Bi(σ(TqEπ(i),π(i)))ki = BiBki

So,BiBki

π(i) = 1 and kikπ(i) = 1 This gives us the following alternatives ki = kπ(i) = 1 or

ki = kπ(i) = −1

σ(zEi,i) = zPN

Step 3 .
Since wt(z±1Ei,i) = ±N and σ should preserve the principal Z-gradation, we can assume
ˆTi,j(Tq)Ej,j. Using a similar
argument to the one used in Step 2 and denoting Ti,π(i)(Tq) := Ti(Tq) and ˆTi,π(i)(Tq) :=
ˆTi(Tq), we can deduce that ˆTj and Tj = 0 for j 6= π(i), and also Ti(Tq) = AiT ri
q and
ˆTi(Tq) = CiT −ri

j=1 Ti,j(Tq)Ej,j and σ(z−1Ei,i) = z−1PN

Therefore, we have rikπ(i) + rπ(i) = 0 and AiAπ(i)Bri

π(i)qkπ(i)ri = 1. On the other hand,

Ei,i

We can therefore conclude that kπ(i)(ki+ri)+rπ(i) = 1 and AiAπ(i)BiBri+ki

π(i) qki+kπ(i)(ri+ki) =

1. From this last equation and the previous step, we get 1 = qki+1.

If ki = 1, then q2 = 1. Since we assumed that q is not a root of unity, it is easy to check

that these are not anti-automorphisms. Therefore, ki = −1 , Bi = Bπ(i) and rπ(i) = ri.

By now,

σ(Eii) = Eπ(i),π(i),

σ(zEii) = AizT ri

and also Bi = Bπ(i) and rπ(i) = ri, for Ai, Aπn(i), Bi ǫ C× and ri ǫ Z.

σ, we have that

using (2.11), we must have π(π(i) + i − j) ≤ N − i + j because we would otherwise get

z in the right-hand side above, so

Ei,j = σ(Eπ(i)+i−j,π(i))σ(C i,j(Tq)Eπ(i)+i−j,π(i)+i−j)

Then, C i,j(Bπ(i)+i−jT −1

and π(j) = π(i) + i − j . Therefore, and because Bi = Bπ(i), we can write C π(j),π(i)(Tq) =

Using (2.11) with condition π(i) ≤ N − i + j, we have that π(j) = π(i) + i − j, therefore
π(j) ≥ i − j + 1 trivially. So,

and it is immediate that π(j) ≤ i − j, then:

Because of this, we have Si,j(Tq) = c−1

if π(i) ≥ j − i + 1
if π(i) ≤ j − i

We now intend to determine the permutation π. So, let i0 be such that π(i0) = N. In
case a and case c, π(j) = π(i) + i − j and it is easy to see that

(2.20)

π(i − 1) = π(i) + 1 for any i 6= i0.

Moreover, since in case b is π(j) = π(i) + i − j − N, we have π(i0 − 1) = 1. Since π is

a bijective map, we conclude that π must be πn given in (2.6) where n = i0 − 1.

Let us note that if i ≤ n, π(i) = n − i + 1, and if i > n, π(i) = N + n + 1 − i. As
a consecuence, we can easily see that, if i > j, π(i) ≤ N − i + j (case a) corresponds
to the choice i ≤ n or j > n, and the case in which j < n and i > n corresponds to

LIE SUBALGEBRAS OF THE MATRIX QUANTUM PSEUDO DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS

π(i) > N − i + j (case b). Similarly for i < j, when i > n or j ≤ n, we have π(i) > j − i
(case c) and the case i ≤ n and j > n corresponds to π(i) ≤ j − i (case d).

Computing zkT l
corresponding restrictions, we have:

qEi,j = σ2(zkT l

Regarding (2.22) when k = 0 we deduce, combining (2.22) with (2.13), that si,j = 0.
On the other hand, k = 1 in (2.22) combined with the fact that rπ(j) = rj, we get

ri = rj. So, ri =(r
Now, due to (2.13) and (2.21), with k = 0, l = 1: Bi = Bj. So, Bi =(B i ≤ n

If we consider k = 1, l = 0 in (2.21) and (2.13), we have Brj

and the fact that Aπ(j) = Aj, we get Ai = Aj. So, Ai =(A i ≤ n

(2.23)

resembling [BL05], and

A2(Bq−1)r = 1

(2.24)

˜A2( ˜Bq−1)˜r = 1.

mπ(i),π(j) + mi,j − k˜r + (k + 1)r = 0

Regarding (2.26) when k = 0, we deduce that

(2.27)

mπ(i),π(j) + mi,j + r = 0.

On the other hand, when k = 1 in (2.26): mπ(i),π(j) + mi,j − ˜r + 2r = 0. Combining the
last two items we get ˜r = r.

Now, due to (2.16) and (2.25) with k = 0, l = 0, ci,jc−1
Combining this with (2.25), we get that for arbitrary values of k and l,

π(i),π(j)B−mπ(i),π(j)Aqmπ(i),π(j) = 1.

B−l+k˜r ˜Bl ˜AkAkql−2˜rk+rk(k−1)/2+kmπ(i),π(j) = 1

If we consider k = 0, l = 1 in the last equation, we get B−1 ˜Bq = 1. So, ˜B = q−1B and
due to (2.23) and (2.24), ˜A2 = A2qr.

Finally, when k = 1, l = 0 in (2.28): qmπ(i),π(j) is constant for every i > n > j. So,
mr,s = m for every r > n > s.

Now, because of (2.27),

(2.29)

2m + r = 0.

Letting k = 2, l = 0 in (2.28), we have B2r ˜A2A2q−3r+2m = 1. Since ˜A2 = A2qr,
B2rA4q−2r+2m = 1, resulting in q2m = 1 because of (2.23). So, m = 0 and by (2.29), r = 0
and in (2.23) and (2.24), this implies ˜A2 = A2 = 1.

Again, letting k = 1 and l = 0 in (2.28), ˜AA = 1 and combining this with the previous

equation, we get A = ˜A = ±1.

Cases c and d give the same results.

We have thus arrived at the ﬁnal relations of (2.7).

Now, recall that we have for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, Eπ(i),π(i) = σ(Ei,i) = σ(Ei,i−1Ei−1,i) =
σ(Ei−1,i)σ(Ei,i−1). So, rewriting (2.18) and (2.19) for these cases, we have:

(2.30)

and

(2.31)

σ(Ei,i−1) =(ci,i−1Eπ(i)+1,π(i)

zci,i−1E1,N

i,i−1EN,1

if π(i − 1) > 1
if π(i − 1) = 1

If i > j, since σ(Ei,j) = σ(Ei,i−1Ei−1,i−2 · · · Ej+1,j), we get (2.8a). Finally, (2.8b) are
results of (2.13), (2.15) and (2.17) combined with the fact that m = 0.

On the other hand, it is straightforward to check that σ deﬁned by (2.7) is indeed anti-
involution of S a

where A, B, ci,j, r ǫ C, A2(Bq−1)r = 1 and ci,j verify relations (2.8a) and (2.8b).

Proof. If n = N there is no case b in the proof of Theorem 2.1, so this Corollary is the
result of restricting it to case a.
(cid:3)

Remark 2.3. Case N = 1 coincides with [BL05].

We will now concentrate on the implications of conditions (2.8a) and (2.8b). First, let
us note that as a consequence of (2.8a), all coeﬁcients ci,j are completely determined by

(2.33)

ci := ci+1,i,

i = 1, · · · , N − 1

and the upper condition of (2.8b) can be written as ci.cπn(i+1) = 1 (i 6= n − 1) by
(2.20). Combining the lower condition of (2.8b) with (2.8a) we get 1 = cn.(cN,1)−1 =

cn.Qi(ci)−1 = Qi6=n(ci)−1. Also, let us note that the permutation πn is given by two

simple permutations of the sets {1, · · · , n} and {n + 1, · · · , N}. Thus, Eq. (2.8b) reduces
to

cicn−i = 1 (1 ≤ i ≤ n),

cn+icN −i = 1 (1 ≤ i < N − n)

(2.34)

and

(2.35)

ci.

1 =Yi6=n

Let N = t + n and let us analyze the previous formulas. If n (respectively, t) is even,

by (2.34) we have Qi<n ci = cn/2 and (cn/2)2 = 1 (respectively, Qi>n ci = cn+(t/2) and

(cn+(t/2))2 = 1). The coeﬃcient cn/2 (respectively, cn+(t/2)) will be called a ﬁxed point. If
N is even, the condition in (2.35) will be satisﬁed if the (possible) ﬁxed points are both
equal to 1 or to −1. If N is odd, the (possible) ﬁxed points must all equal 1.

From now on, we will consider separately the cases N = n and n < N in an attempt

to exhibit more clearly their particular results.

Note that ˙σA,B,r from [BL05] agrees with σA,B,c,r,N for N = 1.

Let us now analyze the relation among S A,B,c,r,N
for diﬀerent values of A, B, c, r and N.
To that end, let s ǫ C, denote by θs the automorphism of S a
q,N given by θs(M) = M,
θs(zI) = zI and θs(TqI) = qsTqI, where M ǫ M atN C and I stands for the identity matrix.
It is easy to check that θs preserves the principal Z−gradation of S a
q,N . Making use of
the equation for σA,B,c,r,1 pointed out in (3.2), we have

(3.3)

θsσA,B,c,r,N θ−s = σqsr A,q−2sB,c,r,N

We shall introduce some notation in order to give an explicit description of this family

of subalgebras.

matrix M ǫ M atm×n(C), deﬁne

An extension of ˙σ±,B,r to a map on M atn×t(Sq) = Sq ⊗ M atn×t(C) can be made by

taking [ ˙σ±,B,r(M)]i,j = ˙σ±,B,r(Mi,j).

Case +: We deﬁne the following map on M atn×t(Sq):

LIE SUBALGEBRAS OF THE MATRIX QUANTUM PSEUDO DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS

(3.8)

M †1 = ˙σ+,q,r(M †)

Explicitly, the anti-involution σ+,r,N on Sq,N = Sq ⊗ M atN (C) is given by

(3.9)

where M ǫ M atn×n(Sq), and

σ+,r,N (M) =(cid:0)M †1(cid:1) ,

(3.10)

q,N = {M : M + M †1 = 0}.
Case -: Now, consider the following map on M atn×t(Sq):

S +,r,N

(3.11)

M ∗1 := ˙σ−,q,r(M †).

Then σ−,r,N on Sq,N is explicitly given by

σ−,r,N (M) = (M ∗1) ,

where M ǫ M atn×n(Sq). And

Let us note that S ±,r,N

are lie subalgebras of Sq,N and that †1 and ∗1 are anti-

Remark 3.2. Replacing † by T (usual transpose) in (3.8) and (3.11) gives us another
family of involutions that we shall denote by σT
±,r,N , which do not preserve the principal
Z-gradation. Moreover, the corresponding subalgebras are not Z-graded subalgebras of
Sq,N , even though they are isomorphic to the others using that M † = JM T J −1, where J
is the following N × N matrix

(3.14)

J = 0 · · ·

This way, we get AdJ ◦ σT

±,r,N = σ±,r,N .

3.2. Generators of S ǫ,r,N
S ǫ,r,N
q,N .
Let us denote C[w, w−1](ǫ),j (where ǫ = 1 or ǫ = −1) the set of Laurent polynomials

q,N . We can now give a detailed description of the generators of

such that f (w−1) = −(ǫ)jf (w), and let ¯l = 0 if l is odd and ¯l = 1 if l is even.

Note that S ǫ,r,N

q,N = {x − σǫ,r,N (x) : x ǫ Sq,N } and observe that by (3.7)

˙σ±,q,r(zk(q(k−1)/2Tq)kr/2f (q(k−1)/2Tq)) = (±z)k(q(k−1)/2Tq)kr/2f ((q(k−1)/2Tq)−1).

Here and in the following we will use the description of the elements in the subalgebras

used in (3.10) and (3.13). The following is a set of generators of S ±,r,N
q,N .

14

KARINA BATISTELLI - CARINA BOYALLIAN

{zk(q(k−1)/2Tq)kr/2(f (q(k−1)/2Tq)Ei,n+1−j − (ǫ)kf ((q(k−1)/2Tq)−1)Ej,n+1−i) : k ǫ Z,
f ǫC[w, w−1](ǫ),k, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n},

and the generators on the opposite diagonal are

{zk(q(k−1)/2Tq)kr/2f (q(k−1)/2Tq)Ei,n+1−i : k ǫ Z, f ǫC[w, w−1](ǫ),k, 1 ≤ i ≤ n}.

3.3. Geometric realization of σ±,r,N . In this subsection we give a geometric realization
of σ±,r,N . The algebra Sq,N acts on the space V = CN [z, z−1] and we deﬁne two bilinear
forms on V :

(3.15)

B±(h, g) = Resz(Φ±(hT )Jg),

where J = z−2JN , JN as in (3.14) and Φ± : V → V given by Φ±(h(z)) = h(±z), h(z) ǫ V .

Proposition 3.3.

(a) The bilinear forms B± are nondegenerated. Moreover, B+ is

symmetric and B− is anti-simmetric.
(b) For any L ǫ Sq,N and h, g ǫ V we have

(3.16)

B±(Lh, g) = B±(h, (T −kr/2σ±,r,N (L)T kr/2)(g)),

where L = zkT kr/2p(Tq)(A). In other words, L and T −kr/2σ±,r,N (L)T kr/2 are ad-
joint operators with respect to B±.

Proof.

(a) The statements are straightforward.

(b) Let L = zkT kr/2p(Tq)(A), h = zuep and g = zseq. Recall that

L(h) = zk+uqrku/2p(qu)(Aep)

σ±,r,N (L)(g) = (±1)kzs+kqskr/2p(q−k−s+1)A†eq.

and

So,

(3.17)

B±(L(zuep), zseq) = Resz(±z)k+uqrku/2p(qu)eT

p AT z−2JN zseq
= (±1)k+uqrku/2p(qu)δk+u+s,1(AT JN )(p,q).

On the other hand, we have

(3.18)

B±(h, σ±,r,N (L)g) = Resz(±1)k+uzu+k+s−2qskr/2p(q−k−s+1)eT

p JN A†eq

= ((±1)k+uqskr/2δk+u+s,1p(q−k−s+1)JN A†)(p,q)
= ((±1)k+uqskr/2p(q−k−s+1)δk+u+s,1JN A†)(p,q)

Note that if we multiply (3.17) by qskr/2 and (3.18) by qsku/2, we get

(3.19)

B±(L(zuep), T kr/2Izseq) = B±(T kr/2Izuep, σ±,r,N (L)zseq).

LIE SUBALGEBRAS OF THE MATRIX QUANTUM PSEUDO DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS

15

It is easy to prove that, for α ǫ C,

B±(T αIzuep, zseq) = B±(zuep, σ±,r,N (T αI)zseq).

Making use of this result in (3.19), we can see that

B±(σ±,r,N (T kr/2I)L(zuep), zseq) = B±(zuep, σ±,r,N (T kr/2I)σ±,r,N (L)zseq).

Thus, as expected, we get

B±(L(zuep), zseq) = B±(zuep, (T −kr/2I)σ±,r,N (L)(T kr/2I)zseq).

(cid:3)

Remark 3.4. In a similar fashion, we can deﬁne the following nondegenerate bilinear forms
on V :

BT

±(h, g) = Resz(Φ±(hT )JT g),

where

with In the n × n identity matrix, and it easily follows that they satisfy

JT = z−2In,

B±(Lh, g) = B±(h, T −kr/2σT

±,r,N (L)T kr/2g),

where σT

±,n were deﬁned in Remark 3.2.

4.1. Lie subalgebras of Sq,N . Let S ±,B,c,n

(4.1)

S ±,B,c,n

q,N

= {a ǫ Sq,N |σ±,B,c,n(a) = −a}.

As in the case n = N, we analyze the relation among S ±,B,c,n
for diﬀerent values of
B, c and n. Let s ǫ C, denote by θs the automorphism of S a
q,N given by θs(M) = M,
θs(zI) = zI and θs(TqI) = qsTqI, where I stands for the identity matrix and M ǫ M atN C.
Clearly θs preserves the principal Z−gradation of S a
q,N . As before, we have for this case
the following:

Remark 4.2. Due to this Lemma, we can ﬁnd a complex number s such that B = q.
Moreover, recall that in the case n = N, we ﬁnd a complex number such that A = ±1
(which makes B = q as a consequence). So, in both cases, the subalgebra S A,B,c,r,n
is
isomorphic to S ±1,q,1,r,n
and the only distinction between both cases is regarding r: while
r takes an arbitrary value in the case n = N, if n < N r happens to be 0.

We will write σ±,n and S ±,n

As in the previous section, for any matrix M ǫ M atm×n(C), we deﬁne

i,j = Mn+1−j,m+1−i,

i.e., the transpose with respect to the ”other” diagonal. Recall once again the anti-

We extend ˙σA,B,r to a map on M ata×b(Sq) = Sq ⊗M ata×b(C) by taking [ ˙σ±,B,r(M)]i,j =

where M ǫ M atn×n(Sq), B ǫ M atn×t(Sq), C ǫ M att×n(Sq), and D ǫ M att×t(Sq). We

can write the anti-involution σ+,n on Sq,N = Sq ⊗ M atN (C) explicity as

The fact that σ+,n(a) = −a implies C †3 = −B and B†2 = −C, and these two conditions
are equivalent because (B†2)†3 = B. Moreover, proving that S +,n

the identities B†2 = z−1B†1, C †4 = zC †3, (B†2)†1 = Bz−1, B†4 z−1 = B†2, etc. Observe,

however, that †2 and †3 are not anti-automorphisms. The following identities are also
useful:

(4.10)

˙σ+,q,0(z−1 ˙σ+,q,0(zkf (Tq))) = (zkf (Tq))z−1,
˙σ+,1,0(z−1 ˙σ+,q,0(zkf (Tq))) = z−1(zkf (Tq)).

Case -: As we have seen in the analysis following equation (2.35), the case N even and
n (also t) odd is impossible. Therefore we may suppose, due to the symmetry, that t is
even. Now, we shall consider the following maps:

(4.11)

M ∗1 := ˙σ−,q,0(M †),
B∗2 := z−1 ˙σ−,q,0(B†),
C ∗3 := z ˙σ−,1,0(C †),
D∗4 := ˙σ−,1,0(D†),

where M ǫ M atn×n(Sq), B ǫ M atn×t(Sq), C ǫ M att×n(Sq), and D ǫ M att×t(Sq). Then

the anti-involution σ−,n on Sq,N is explicitly given by

(4.12)

and

S −,n

q,N =(cid:26)(cid:18) M B

−B∗2 D(cid:19) : M + M ∗1 = 0 and D + D∗4 = 0(cid:27).

As before, condition σ−,n(a) = −a implies C ∗3 = −B and B∗2 = −C, and these two
conditions are equivalent due to the fact that (B∗2)∗3 = B. Moreover, to prove that
S −,n
q,N is a Lie subalgebra of Sq,N by direct computations, requires using that ∗1 and ∗4
are anti-automorphisms, and the identities B∗2 = z−1B∗1, D∗4 = zD∗3, (B∗2)∗1 = Bz−1,
B∗4z−1 = B∗2, etc. Once again, ∗2 and ∗3 are not anti-automorphisms. We also need to
use:

(4.14)

˙σ−,q,0(z−1 ˙σ−,q,0(zkf (Tq))) = −(zkf (Tq))z−1,
˙σ−,1,0(z−1 ˙σ−,q,0(zkf (Tq))) = −z−1(zkf (Tq)).

Remark 4.3. Replacing † by T (usual transpose) in (4.7) and (4.11) gives another family of
involutions denoted by σT
±,n. These involutions do not preserve the principal Z-gradation,
and the corresponding subalgebras are not Z-graded subalgebras of Sq,N , but they are
isomorphic to the others using the same argument in Remark 3.2.

Let us denote C[w, w−1](ǫ),j (where ǫ = 1 or ǫ = −1 the set of Laurent polynomials such

that f (w−1) = −(ǫ)jf (w). And let ¯l = 0 if l is odd and ¯l = 1 if l is even.

Recall that

and also,

˙σ±,q,0(zkf (q(k−1)/2Tq)) = (±z)kf ((q(k−1)/2Tq)−1)

˙σ±,1,0(zkf (qk/2Tq)) = (±z)kf (q−k/2T −1

q

).

Therefore, the following is a set of generators of S ±,n

q,N , using the description of the

elements in the subalgebras given in (4.9) and (4.13).

• For block M, where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n:

{zk(f (q(k−1)/2Tq)Ei,n+1−j−(ǫ)kf ((q(k−1)/2Tq)−1)Ej,n+1−i) : k ǫ Z, f ǫC[w, w−1], 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n}.

and the generators on the opposite diagonal are

{zkf (q(k−1)/2Tq)Ei,n+1−i : k ǫ Z, f ǫC[w, w−1](ǫ),k, 1 ≤ i ≤ n}.
• For blocks B (and C), where i ≤ n and j > n (or j ≤ n and i > n):

{zk(f (q(k−1)/2Tq)Ei,n+j − (ǫ)kz−1f ((q(k−1)/2Tq)−1)EN +1−j,n+1−i) : k ǫ Z, f ǫC[w, w−1],

1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ N − n}.

• For block D, where i, j > n:

{zk(f (qk/2Tq)En+i,N +1−j − f (q−k/2T −1

q

)En+j,N +1−i) : k ǫ Z, f ǫC[w, w−1], 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N − n},

and the generators on the opposite diagonal are

{zkf (qk/2Tq)En+i,N +1−i : k ǫ Z, f ǫC[w, w−1](ǫ),k, 1 ≤ i ≤ N − n}.

4.3. Geometric realization of σ±,n. In this section we give a geometric realization of
σ±,n.

The algebra Sq,N acts on the space V = CN [z, z−1] and we deﬁne two bilinear forms

on V :

(4.15)

where

B±(h, g) = Resz(Φ±(hT )Jg),

J = z−2Jn

with Φ : V → V given by Φ±(h(z)) = h(±z), h(z) ǫ V , and Jn as in (3.14). Observe
that V = Cn[z, z−1] × Ct[z, z−1] is an orthogonal decomposition of V . Now, consider the
following proposition.

Proposition 4.4.

(a) The bilinear forms B± are nondegenerated. Moreover, B+ is
symmetric and B− is symmetric in the subspace Cn[z, z−1] and anti-symmetric in
Ct[z, z−1].

(b) For any L ǫ Sq,N and h, g ǫ V we have

(4.16)

B±(Lh, g) = B±(h, σ±,n(L)g),

that is, L and σ±,n(L) are adjoint operators with respect to B±.

Proof.

(a) The statements are straightforward.

(b) Let L = zkp(Tq)(M B

CD ), h = zuep, and g = zseq be as shown previously. Recall that

L(h) = zk+up(qu)(M B

and

So,

δk+u+s,1JtB†

δk+u+s,0JnC †

δk+u+s,0JtD†(cid:17)(p,q)

As the last two results are equal, we ﬁnish the proof.

(cid:3)

Remark 4.5. In a similar fashion, we can deﬁne the following nondegenerate bilinear forms
on V :

BT

±(h, g) = Resz(Φ±(hT )JT g),

where

JT = z−2In

where σT

±,n were deﬁned in (3.14).

B±(Lh, g) = B±(h, σT
