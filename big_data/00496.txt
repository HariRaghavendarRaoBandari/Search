In this paper we suggest a simple analytical method for description of electromagnetic properties
of a geometrically regular two-dimensional subwavelength arrays (metasurfaces) formed by particles
with randomly ﬂuctuating polarizabilities. Such metasurfaces are of topical importance due to
development of mass-scale bottom-up fabrication methods, for which ﬂuctuations of the particles
sizes, shapes, and/or composition are inevitable. Understanding and prediction of electromagnetic
properties of such random metasurfaces is a challenge. We propose an analytical homogenization
method applicable for normal wave incidence on particles arrays with dominating electric dipole
responses and validate it with numerical point-dipole modeling using the supercell approach. We
demonstrate that ﬂuctuations of particles polarizabilities lead to increased diﬀuse scattering despite
the subwavelength lattice constant of the array. The proposed method can be readily extended to
oblique incidence and particles with both electric and magnetic dipole resonances.

INTRODUCTION

Exciting opportunities to control electromagnetic radi-
ation with artiﬁcial composite materials with the prop-
erties on demand (metamaterials)1 have led to an ex-
ideas on the constituent elements designs
plosion of
as well as potential applications2.
In the most com-
mon case the building blocks (meta-atoms) are identi-
cal complex-shape resonant particles placed in a regu-
lar two-dimensional (metasurface) or three-dimensional
(3D metamaterial) lattice.
It became, however, obvi-
ous from the very beginning of the “metamaterials era”
that a certain degree of randomness is inevitably present
during fabrication. Moreover, cheap and mass-scale self-
assembly methods3–6 are intensively developed for op-
tical metamaterials as a replacement of more precise,
but expensive deterministic nanolithography (electron
beam lithography, focused ion beam milling, nanoimprint
lithography). From this practical point of view there is
a strong interest in the random systems not only in the
area of metamaterials, but also broader7, widening the
topic of inhomogeneous composites, whose homogeniza-
tion has been actively studied in the last one and a half
centuries (see the overview in [8]).

Random metamaterials were investigated for appli-
cations in superlensing9, electromagnetic absorbers10,11
and light-trapping structures12. Optical properties of
metamaterials with positional disorder were character-
ized experimentally and modeled numerically13,14. Sub-

sequently, Albooyeh et al. suggested to account for addi-
tional scattering losses through the modiﬁed imaginary
part of the dipoles interaction constant Im(β)15. Later
this approach was extended on a more general case of
oblique incidence16. However, no any analytical connec-
tion between the correction coeﬃcient to Im(β) and dis-
order characteristics of the metamaterial was proposed.
In this work we propose an analytical method for calcu-
lating additional scattering losses of a metasurface con-
sisting of random meta-atoms placed in a regular two-
dimensional array. The analytical predictions are con-
ﬁrmed by numerical simulations employing the discrete
dipole approximation with the supercell approach.

All dipole moments are assumed to be parallel to the
external electric ﬁeld vector, so we are using scalar rep-
resentation instead of ﬁeld and dipole moment vectors
throughout the paper. We also use the optical conven-
tion for the exponential exp(−iωt).

II. ANALYTICAL DESCRIPTION OF

RANDOM METASURFACE

We consider a regular two-dimensional array of meta-
atoms (in other words, a metasurface). We assume that
the considered particles behave as electric dipoles, possi-
bly resonant, and the incident plane wave with amplitude
E0 excites only the electric dipole moment p, but nei-
ther a magnetic dipole nor higher-order multipoles [see

ﬁelds the following methods and results can be easily
generalized on the magnetic ﬁeld and magnetic multipole
moments.

As we see, the power scattered by a dipole particle is
determined by the imaginary part of the inverse polar-
izability. That is why for the purposes of this study,
where we will estimate the diﬀuse scattering from arrays
of random-polarizability particles, it is convenient to for-
mulate the excitation problem in terms of the inverse
polarizabilities. Thus, instead of operating with dipole
moment p excited by electric ﬁeld E0 at the position of
the dipole [see Fig. 1(a)], we formulate the problem in a
reverse way by addressing electric ﬁeld E excited at the
dipole position by a virtual “dipole moment source” p.
The excited electric ﬁeld is

E = − 1

where η is the free-space impedance, and we have taken
into account that radiation from the subwavelength ar-
ray may occur only into plane waves propagating to the
opposite sides from the array normally to its plane. From
here it is easy to get the exact expression for Im(β):

Im(β) =

If we introduce the normalized polarizability αn =
αe/ε0a3 and the normalized interaction constant βn =

eﬃcients can be expressed as

where the minus sign comes from the fact that by deﬁni-
tion the dipole moment is directed from a negative charge
to the positive charge, thus the excited electric ﬁeld inside
the particle is directed oppositely to the dipole moment.

and the loss factor (in the case of subwavelength regular
arrays only absorbance contributes to it) reads

A = 1 − |r|2 − |t|2.

the sum of the incident ﬁeld and the interaction ﬁeld

which means that the loss factor (diﬀuse scattering in
this case, since the particles are lossless) is proportional
to the randomness factor ∆ and inversely proportional
to λ4 in agreement with the assumption of the Rayleigh
scattering regime.

As an illustrative example we consider an array of
spherical particles of radius R homogeneously distributed
in the interval [Rmean(1 − δ/2); Rmean(1 + δ/2)] (δ is the
“size randomness” parameter) around the mean value of
the radius Rmean = 20 nm and arranged in a regular
square array with lattice constant a = 200 nm. The
particles are made of a plasmonic Drude material with
plasma frequency ωP = 1.63 × 1015 s−1 and suspended
in free space. The considered frequency range of inter-
est lies around the plasmonic resonance frequency for an
isolated spherical particle f0 = ωP /2π
3 = 150 THz
corresponding to the wavelength λ = 2 µm. The array is
well subwavelength (a ≈ λ/10).

√

In case of lossless particles, there are no losses (nei-
ther Ohmic, nor diﬀuse scattering) in the regular array
of non-ﬂuctuating particles. With increasing randomness
[see Fig. 2(a)], the diﬀuse scattering losses grow up. The
curves experience the maximum close to the resonant fre-
quency, which is quite natural, since the amplitude of
the excited dipole moment as well as the ﬂuctuations are
maximal around the resonance. At frequency 149.8 THz
a sharp dip in scattering losses is observed. This dip
happens exactly on the plasmonic resonance frequency
(Re(1/αe) = 0) and is related to the speciﬁc type of ran-
domization, that is particles radius randomness. Indeed,
the inverse polarizability of a spherical particle in the

onance (Re(1/αe) = 0) the inverse polarizabilities of all

thus, no diﬀuse scattering can occur at this frequency,
and the loss factor A = 0.

In case of lossy particles [see Fig. 2(b)] the total
losses calculated with the formulas (12)-(13) include both
Ohmic and scattering losses. Comparing these total
losses [Fig. 2(b), solid lines] with the Ohmic losses for
the array of regular particles (dashed lines), we see that
diﬀuse scattering losses dominate in case of small mate-
rial losses below γ = 1010 s−1. For comparison, material
losses of noble metals are in the order of γ ≈ 1014 − 1015
s−1 and of graphene of γ ≈ 1012 − 1014 s−1.

III. NUMERICAL SUPERCELL APPROACH

In order to test the proposed analytical model of dif-
fuse scattering losses, we performed modeling of a regular
array of random particles using the supercell approach.
Since the eﬀects are clearly observable for small Ohmic
losses, we considered the lossless particles case only. In
the frame of the supercell approach the particles are ran-
dom within each supercell, and the supercells are period-
ically repeated in space [see the illustration in Fig. 3(a)].
Since the respective dipoles in various supercells are
identical [for example, the red circles on Fig. 3(a)], this
allows us to take into account all the interactions within
the inﬁnite quasi-random array as well as with the in-
cident plane wave. Thus, we are able to determine the

(Color online). (a) Illustration of the supercell modeling approach: particles are random within each supercell; the

dipole moments of all N × N particles within a super-
cell by solving a system of N 2 linear equations (refer to
Appendix 1 for details).

After knowing all the dipole moments we are able to
calculate the scattered ﬁelds of each dipole [see Fig. 3(b)]
as well as the total intensity of transmitted, reﬂected or
diﬀusely scattered electromagnetic waves by the complete
inﬁnite array (refer to Appendix 2 for details). In order to
properly simulate randomness, the supercells are larger
than the wavelength and being periodically repeated in
space the supercells form a two-dimensional diﬀraction
grating, so that only speciﬁc directions for scattering are
allowed.
We used supercells with the sizes from 13×13 to 19×19
particles. The results of 2000 random realizations (500
realizations of the each supercells of sizes 13×13, 15×15,
17 × 17 and 19 × 19) are overlapped in Figs. 4 and 5
and compared to the analytical prediction. Even though
such quasi-random supercells arrays are a kind of two-
dimensional diﬀraction gratings, and the diﬀuse scatter-
ing is allowed to certain directions only, consideration of
various supercells sizes gives a good approximation for a
truly random inﬁnite array.

The results for diﬀerent supercell sizes are not iden-
tical, as can be seen from the coloring of speciﬁc parts
of the graphs in Figs. 4-5. Namely, cyan corresponds to
13x13, yellow to 15x15, magenta to 17x17 and grey to
19x19 supercell size, while green, red, and blue colors are
the results of overlapping cyan and yellow, yellow and
magenta, and magenta and cyan, correspondingly. The
darkest area represents the most probable value of the
loss factor.

We observe not only qualitative, but also quantita-
tive agreement between the numerical and analytical
curves, reproducing the maximum of diﬀuse scattering,
except for the case of large size randomness factor δ = 1
[Fig. 4(d)], for which the analytical approach underes-
timates the diﬀuse scattering losses. The resonant dip

corresponding to the plasmonic resonance is observed at
the same frequencies for analytical and numerical curves
in all cases. The dip width in numerical modeling is,
however, larger than the analytical formulas predict and
that requires further investigation.

The agreement between analytics and numerics is
nearly perfect away from the resonance. However, in the
very proximity to the plasmonic resonance the numerical
spectra exhibit sharp features that are more pronounced
for larger randomness and are most probably related to
the eﬀects of localized resonances excitation in a two-
dimensional array.

Overall, the values of the loss factor due to diﬀuse scat-
tering are small for small randomness [for example, -70
dB for δ = 0.001, see Fig. 4 (a)] but can be quite signiﬁ-
cant for larger randomness [see Figs. 4 (c) and (d)].

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we introduced a simple analytical model
of diﬀuse scattering in periodical two-dimensional arrays
of particles with random polarizabilities in each unit cell.
The diﬀuse scattering is estimated through a correction
of the imaginary part of the interaction constant Im(β)
and is related to the statistics of the random particles
polarizabilities. We considered ﬂuctuations of particle
radius, but the derived formulas are general and can be
applied to any possible ﬂuctuations of particles geometri-
cal and material parameters. The analytical formula pre-
dicts a resonant increase of the diﬀuse scattering losses
in the vicinity of the plasmonic resonance and this eﬀect
is conﬁrmed by numerical modeling with the supercell
approach.
We would like to emphasize the fact that the ar-
ray under consideration is deeply subwavelength (a ≈
λ/20 − λ/5 in Fig. 5) and for subwavelength regular ar-

in principle. The observed eﬀects can be explained, sim-
plistically, by stating that even a deeply-subwavelength
regular array of particles with random polarizabilities be-
comes eﬀectively inhomogeneous also at the wavelength
scale, making diﬀuse scattering possible.

The proposed analytical approach underestimates dif-
fuse scattering losses for large randomness and this is
expected, since the analytical description was formulated
from the very beginning for small deviations from a regu-
lar array of identical particles. For very large randomness
other methods should be used.

In most practical situations, the material loss contribu-
tion to the total loss factor are typically much larger than
the diﬀuse scattering due to randomness of the polariz-
abilities. The diﬀuse scattering can, however, be consid-

7

erable for arrays of low-loss all-dielectric metamaterials,
which are currently attracting considerable attention of
the scientiﬁc community. We believe that the suggested
simple approach will be especially useful for the descrip-
tion of all-dielectric random metamaterials and metasur-
faces.

Appendix A: Supercell approach

In the supercell approach we replace the random array
with a quasi-random array, namely, with a periodic array
of square N × N -cells supercells, and within each super-
cell the particles are chosen randomly [see Fig. 3 (a)].
The particles at identical positions number (m, n) within
diﬀerent supercells are identical and under normally in-
cident plane wave illumination they have identical dipole
moments.

αm,n = αm+N,n = αm,n+N ,
pm,n = pm+N,n = pm,n+N .

(A1)
(A2)

For simplicity of numeration we can always consider the
particle (m, n) as the center of a virtual moving frame
(red dashed rectangle in Fig. 3 (a)) of the size N × N .
Therefore we can temporary call pm,n ≡ ˜p0,0 and αm,n ≡
˜α0,0. Moreover, we can require that N is an odd integer
N = 2N0 + 1, where N0 is an integer number.

We consider normally incident plane waves of the am-
plitude E0. The dipole moment of the considered particle
can be written through the inﬁnite sum

(A6)

βm(cid:48),n(cid:48) =

bm(cid:48)+NM(cid:48),n(cid:48)+N N(cid:48),

we reformulate the Eq. (A3) to a ﬁnite sum and obtain
the equation for the dipole moment

βm(cid:48),n(cid:48) ˜pm(cid:48),n(cid:48) = E0.

(A8)

Such equation can be written for each particle within
the supercell. If we renumerate the initial particle (m, n)
within the square supercell so that its number l = (m −
1)N + n and using the periodicity Eq. (A1) and the fact
that βm(cid:48),n(cid:48) = β−m(cid:48),n(cid:48) and applying the correct index
shift, we get a system of N × N set of linear equations
for determination of the dipole moments of each particle
within the system:

(A − B) [p] = E0 [1] ,

(A9)

where

Practically, when calculating coeﬃcients βm(cid:48),n(cid:48) we can-
not sum an inﬁnite number of addends and have to limit
summation at a certain number Nmax

+Nmax(cid:88)

+Nmax(cid:88)

M(cid:48)=−Nmax

N(cid:48)=−Nmax

In other words, instead of an inﬁnite number of super-
cells we consider an array of (2Nmax + 1) × (2Nmax +
1) supercells and free space outside. This abrupt ar-
ray termination causes a problem, since the series for
βm(cid:48),n(cid:48)
is poorly converging due to oscillating complex
exponential in dipole coeﬃcient bm(cid:48),n(cid:48). We used Nmax
up to 500 and have not observed satisfactory conver-
gence. The ﬁnite array interaction constant β∗ =
βm(cid:48),n(cid:48) gives a large relative error of
5% with respect to interaction constant β for an inﬁnite
array 6 and such error in β may result in the loss fac-
tor error larger than the inﬂuence of diﬀuse scattering.
This problem was solved by adjusting βm(cid:48),n(cid:48) coeﬃcients,
namely

(cid:80)+N0

(cid:80)+N0

m(cid:48)=−N0

n(cid:48)=−N0

+Nmax(cid:88)

+Nmax(cid:88)

M(cid:48)=−Nmax

N(cid:48)=−Nmax

βm(cid:48),n(cid:48) =

bm(cid:48)+NM(cid:48),n(cid:48)+N N(cid:48)+(β−β∗)/N 2.

(A11)
Obviously, coeﬃcients βm(cid:48),n(cid:48) deﬁned like this strictly give
the correct value of the interaction constant for an inﬁnite
array

+N0(cid:88)

+N0(cid:88)

M(cid:48)=−N0

N(cid:48)=−N0

βm(cid:48),n(cid:48) = β.

(A12)

It is easy to show that physically this ”adjustment” of
βm(cid:48),n(cid:48) is equivalent to assuming that all particles outside
the (2Nmax+1)(2Nmax+1) supercells array have identical
dipole moments equal to the mean dipole moment within
a supercell

pm,n.

(A13)

This is obviously a more physically sound approximation
to a completely inﬁnite supercells array than the case of
an abrupt array termination, leading to parasitic scatter-
ing from the array edges.

Solving system Eq.

(A9) we ﬁnd all the dipole mo-
ments within the supercell and are able to calculate the
transmitted, reﬂected and diﬀusely scattered powers.

λ in order to observe the eﬀects of diﬀuse scattering and
to have a suﬃcient number of random particles within
each supercell. Thus, the array of the supercells is a kind
of diﬀraction grating. We can calculate explicitly the
transmitted, reﬂected and scattered ﬁelds by this diﬀrac-
tion grating.
First, we consider the dipole p = p0exp(−iωt) in the
center of the coordinate system oriented as shown in Fig.
3 (b). We assume the wave incidence along the z−axis.
The Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) of a point in space
are related to its spherical coordinates as (r, θ, φ) as x =
r sin θ sin φ, y = r cos θ, z = r sin θ cos φ.

The electromagnetic ﬁeld of the dipole in the far zone

in the spherical coordinate system is

(B5)

We can select the coordinate systems in such a way
that the coordinates of a particle number (m, n) within
the supercell are xm = ma, yn = na. Due to randomness
of the array all the dipole moments diﬀer in the ampli-
tude and phase. Moreover, for a speciﬁc direction of the
scattered plane wave propagation with the wavevector
(kx, ky, kz), where kz =
y there is a geo-
metrical phase shift ∆χm,n for the point (xm, yn) with
respect to the coordinate system origin (0, 0)
