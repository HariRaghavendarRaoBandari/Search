The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is the second-largest satellite galaxy of the Milky Way and
is only 60 kpc away. As a nearby, massive, and dense object with relatively low astrophysical
backgrounds, it is a natural target for dark matter indirect detection searches. In this work, we use
six years of Pass 8 data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope to search for gamma-ray signals of
dark matter annihilation in the SMC. Using data-driven ﬁts to the gamma-ray backgrounds, and a
combination of N-body simulations and direct measurements of rotation curves to estimate the SMC
DM density proﬁle, we found that the SMC was well described by standard astrophysical sources,
and no signal from dark matter annihilation was detected. We set conservative upper limits on the
dark matter annihilation cross section. These constraints are in agreement with stronger constraints
set by searches in the Large Magellanic Cloud and approach the canonical thermal relic cross section
at dark matter masses lower than 10 GeV in the b¯b and τ +τ− channels.

INTRODUCTION

It has been clear for many decades that the observed Universe includes a signiﬁcant component of matter which
does not interact like any known ﬁeld in the Standard Model of particle physics. Though solid observational evidence
exists for the gravitational inﬂuence of this dark matter (DM) from the earliest moments of the Universe’s history to
the present day [1–4], no direct measurements have been made of the particle nature of this mysterious substance.

Though by no means the only possibility, a theoretically well motivated class of DM models has interactions between
itself and the Standard Model that are approximately as strong as the weak nuclear force, and a mass of similar scale
(∼10–1000 GeV). Such weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) would generically attain the observed DM
density after thermal freeze-out in the early Universe. The canonical “WIMP” is a ∼100 GeV particle interacting
through the SU (2)L weak force, though many other candidates have been proposed with a wide range of masses and
interaction strengths [5].

These models provide a useful benchmark for DM searches designed to look for the present-day pair annihilation
(or decay) of DM particles in regions of high density of DM. A thermally-averaged annihilation cross section of
(cid:104)σv(cid:105) ∼ 3× 10−26 cm3/s results in approximately the correct WIMP relic density, and so experiments capable of seeing
the present-day annihilation of DM with cross sections near this value have the sensitivity to either conﬁrm or exclude
a large number of theoretically interesting models.

Within the paradigm of annihilating DM, there are many possibilities for the annihilation channel. Of particular
interest is annihilation resulting in gamma rays, as this signature is more easily distinguished from other astrophysical
sources. However this annihilation channel is suppressed; thus, searches for this signature are challenging. In addition
to the direct annihilation to pairs of photons, if DM annihilates into pairs of other Standard Model particles, the
resulting hadronization and/or decay will result in a continuum of gamma rays observable from Earth with an energy
distribution that extends up to the rest mass of the DM particle. Gamma rays are also relatively unaﬀected by the

intervening medium and arrive at the Earth unscattered and unattenuated (at least in the local Universe), which
allows the emission to be tracked. Gamma-ray observations together with separate information or assumptions about
the distribution of DM in the region under study and models for the hadronization then allow measurement, or
determination of upper limits for, the annihilation cross section.

With this motivation in mind, the gamma-ray data set compiled by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) carried by the
Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi-LAT) is of great interest. At the present time, the Fermi-LAT is one of
the most sensitive instruments to DM with weak-scale mass and cross section annihilating into gamma rays. Analysis
of the LAT gamma-ray data can place strong limits on—or discover—DM annihilation with cross sections near the
canonical thermal value into a wide variety of Standard Model particles [6].

A large number of DM searches have been performed using the Fermi-LAT data; as annihilation rates are propor-
tional to the square of the DM density, lower annihilation cross sections can be probed by targeting regions of the
sky with the greatest densities of DM, such as the center of the Milky Way [7–18], satellite dwarf spheroidal galaxies
of the Milky Way [19–25], unresolved halo substructure [26–29], galaxy clusters [30, 31], and the Large Magellanic
Cloud [32].

The LAT observations of the Galactic center indicate that the region is brighter than expected from standard
models for Galactic diﬀuse emission in the few-GeV range, and the spatial distribution is broadly consistent with our
expectations for a DM signal. However, previously unconsidered astrophysical backgrounds could match the observed
morphology and spectrum [33–39], and the true source of the gamma rays remains a subject of much debate.

Considering both the broad interest in indirect searches for DM, and the current questions raised by the Galactic
center excess, it is important to identify new high-density targets for DM annihilation indirect searches. Here we apply
the techniques developed in the search for DM in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) [32], to a similar analysis of the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The SMC is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, approximately 60 kpc away and with
a DM mass of ∼1010 M(cid:12) within a radius of ∼3 kpc [40]. The SMC is in a complicated orbit with its larger cousin
the LMC [41], and the combined Magellanic system appears to be on its ﬁrst approach to the Milky Way [42, 43].
Therefore, the Clouds are not expected to have been substantially tidally stripped of DM by our Galaxy. Though the
SMC DM proﬁle may be aﬀected by its interactions with the LMC, direct measurements of the rotation curve of the
SMC indicate signiﬁcant amounts of DM remain bound to the galaxy itself. As we shall demonstrate in this paper,
the combination of rotation curves and comparison with cosmological simulations of galaxies of the same size that
include baryonic physics indicates that at minimum the amount of DM present in the SMC would result in a DM
annihilation signal as large as the brightest dwarf galaxies, though somewhat dimmer than the LMC itself. This lower
signal is oﬀset by the lower gamma-ray background in the SMC compared to the LMC, as modeled using Fermi-LAT
data [44], and as a result the SMC is an attractive target for DM indirect detection searches.

In Section II, we describe the DM distribution in the SMC and how it relates to searches for indirect signals of DM
annihilation. In Section III, we discuss the Fermi-LAT instrument, the method of modeling the SMC as a gamma-ray
source, and the data set and background models used for the DM analysis. The analysis techniques and the resulting
bounds are shown in Sections IV and V, and we conclude in Section VI.

II. SMC DARK MATTER DISTRIBUTION

The ﬂux spectrum dφ/dEγ of gamma rays from any distribution of DM depends on a number of quantities, which

can be factored into astrophysics- and particle physics-dependent terms [45]:

The quantities in the ﬁrst parentheses are the annihilation cross section-speed product averaged over the velocity
distribution of the DM particles (cid:104)σv(cid:105), the diﬀerential yield of gamma rays from a single DM annihilation dNγ/dEγ,
the mass of the DM particle mχ, and a normalization factor x which is unity if the DM is its own antiparticle and
1/2 if it is not. All of these depend on the unknown microphysics in the dark sector. The typical approach of DM
indirect detection searches, as we will follow here, is to place an upper bound (if no excess is observed) on (cid:104)σv(cid:105) as
a function of mass mχ, assuming a particular spectrum dNγ/dEγ and value for x, the result of making a particular
choice for the DM annihilation channel. In this paper, we assume x = 1 and consider the ﬁnal states b¯b and τ +τ−,
which have been of particular interest given the Galactic center excess. Other sets of Standard Model ﬁnal states are
possible, but have suﬃcient similarity to the channels selected that bounds can reasonably be extrapolated. In this
work, we calculate the spectrum dNγ/dEγ for each ﬁnal state and DM mass choice using code available as part of

3

the Fermi-LAT ScienceTools.1 Note that our implementation does not include electroweak corrections [47–51]. Such
corrections can be important for heavy DM (mχ >∼ 1 TeV); in any case, they would increase the resulting ﬂux and
thus strengthen the resulting bounds [51–53].

In order to describe experimental results in terms of the particle physics quantities in Eq. (1), the astrophysical
quantities in the second set of parentheses must be known. This quantity, the integral of the square of the DM
density along the line of sight and over a solid angle ∆Ω corresponding to the region under study, is known as the
J-factor, and encapsulates the dependence of an indirect detection search on the distribution of DM in the search
target. As the J-factor depends on the density squared for annihilating DM and implicitly on inverse distance squared,
targeting nearby overdensities of DM yields larger values of the J-factor and thus results in searches that probe smaller
annihilation cross sections (cid:104)σv(cid:105). In order to extract results from an analysis of the SMC that can be compared with
indirect detection searches targeting other astrophysical objects, we must determine the DM density distribution of
the SMC, and from this calculate the J-factor.

Our ﬁt to the SMC density proﬁle as a function of radius r is parametrized in terms of a generalized Navarro-Frenk-

where rS is a scale radius, rmax is a maximum radius which we set to 100 kpc (our results are relatively insensitive to
this choice), ρ0 is a normalization factor, Θ is the Heaviside step-function, and (α, β, γ) control the inner and outer
slopes of the proﬁle. The classical NFW proﬁle has (α, β, γ) = (1, 3, 1). We will determine the best ﬁt for the free
parameters rS, ρ0, and (α, β, γ) to the SMC in two ways: ﬁrst by using observations of the SMC to directly build
the rotation curve and from there infer the DM in the inner regions, and second by comparing the SMC to similar
galaxies drawn from cosmological simulations.

Proper motion data for the LMC indicate that it may be on its ﬁrst infall into the Milky Way’s DM halo [42].
The LMC and SMC are likely a pair of dwarf galaxies that are being accreted to the Milky Way together. Both
the Magellanic Bridge (H I gas joining the two galaxies) and the Magellanic Stream (H I gas trailing the orbit of
the Clouds) are best explained by tidal interactions between the two galaxies before infall into the Milky Way [58].
As the smaller of the two galaxies, this may mean that the SMC has been tidally harassed by the LMC, leading
to a somewhat complicated structure. The SMC is elongated along our line of sight, with a bar-like body that we
may be viewing end-on (see e.g. Refs. [59–61]). In fact, it has been suggested that the stellar bar of the LMC is a
remnant of a passage by the SMC through the LMC, leading to a bar that is elevated above the LMC’s disk plane
[58]. Despite these complications, we demonstrate below that simple DM halo models derived from isolated halos
provide a remarkably good ﬁt to the observed rotation curve of the SMC.

Under the assumption of circular orbits, the rotational velocity of a galaxy is a direct measurement of the mass
rot = GM (< r)/r. The contribution of DM to the H I rotation curve of the SMC
enclosed as a function of radius, v2
has been studied in detail by Refs. [40, 62], and we adopt some of their results in this work. To brieﬂy summarize,
Ref. [62] ﬁt a tilted ring model to the H I data, and corrected for asymmetric drift (the velocity dispersion of the SMC
is fairly large, contributing as much dynamical support as the rotational support at some radii). A mean inclination
of i = 40◦ ± 20◦ was found. By ﬁtting an exponential disk with a scale height of 1 kpc, the H I+He mass of the SMC
was found to be 5.6×108 M(cid:12). Ref. [40] adopted i = 40◦, and explored varying stellar mass-to-light ratios (M/LV ,
where LV is the V -band luminosity of 4.3×108 L(cid:12)). Based on the SMC’s derived star formation history [63], Ref. [40]
suggest that M/LV in the range of 2–4 is reasonable. They adopt M/LV = 2.3 as their ﬁducial model, giving a SMC
stellar mass of 9.9×108 M(cid:12) with rs = 5.1 kpc.
In Figure 1 we show the rotation curve data, adopted from Ref. [40]. We assume i = 40◦, and Mstellar = 9.9×108
M(cid:12) (i.e., M/LV = 2.3). The lines show the contribution from the H I+He gas, the stellar component, and the model
that best ﬁts both the inner and outer observed total rotation curve. This model has an NFW proﬁle, and is denoted
as the NFW model for the remainder of the paper.

As in Ref. [32], we also use state-of-the-art cosmological simulations to determine the “typical” DM density proﬁle
for a galaxy with the stellar mass of the SMC. We use a set of simulations that have shown that energetic feedback
from stars and supernovae can transform an initially steep inner density proﬁle into a shallower proﬁle [65–67]. The
degree of transformation is sensitive to the mass of stars formed [67, 68], and the stellar mass is dependent on halo

mass [69, 70]. These simulations have been shown to match the observed stellar-to-halo mass relation at redshift
z = 0 [94]. Ref. [64] has provided a general relation for the generalized NFW parameters (α, β, γ) as a function of
stellar-to-halo mass ratio. Therefore, we can extract a range of generalized NFW proﬁles appropriate for the SMC
from simulations.

To ﬁnd the generalized NFW parameters that best describe the SMC, we searched for simulated galaxies in the
available set that have a luminosity in the same range as the SMC. We adopt a stellar mass for the SMC in the range
4–16×108M(cid:12) (by adopting a luminosity of 4 × 108L(cid:12) and 1 < M/L < 4). Five simulated galaxies were in this stellar
mass range, and had −2.0 < log10(Mstellar/Mhalo) < −1.7. We averaged the generalized proﬁle from Ref. [67] at these
two extremes, and found it to yield a remarkably good ﬁt to the observed rotation curve when added to the stellar
and H I contributions, shown by the red line in Figure 1. This model is referred to as the gNFW model below.

In Table I, we summarize the two DM proﬁles, NFW and gNFW, which we will use for the remainder of the analysis.
We explore both proﬁles because they span a range of density proﬁles consistent with the observations. The NFW
model was shown by Ref. [40] to be a good ﬁt to the observed rotation curve, and has the expected steep DM density
proﬁle that is consistently produced in N -body simulations of galaxy formation in Cold Dark Matter (CDM). However,
observations and recent simulations that include energy feedback from stars suggest that the slopes of the DM density
proﬁles of galaxies with the stellar mass of the SMC should be much shallower than NFW (Refs. [65–68]). Adopting
these two models allows us to explore the range of allowed proﬁles. The J-factors for each proﬁle were calculated
assuming an SMC distance of 60 kpc [71]. We adopt as the center of the SMC the reported stellar kinematic center at
J2000 epoch (α, δ) = (13 .◦19,−72 .◦83), though we will later scan over the possible central location when performing
our ﬁt. As can be seen, the resulting J-factors of log10 J/(GeV2/cm5) ∼19.1–19.6 are competitive with the best dwarf
galaxies, which have log10 J/(GeV2/cm5) ∼19–19.5 [72, 73]. For comparison, the Galactic center, integrated over the
inner 1◦, has log10 J/(GeV2/cm5) >∼21–24 [10], and the LMC has log10 J/(GeV2/cm5) ∼19.5–20.5 [32]. We should

emphasize that it is possible for the SMC DM to be more concentrated in the inner region, resulting in a signiﬁcantly
larger J-factor; however to set conservative lower limits we adopt this lower range.

III. FERMI-LAT OBSERVATIONS OF THE SMC

The Fermi-LAT is a pair-conversion telescope. Incoming gamma rays pass through the anti-coincidence detector
and convert in the tracker to e+/e− pairs. The charged particle direction is reconstructed using the information in
the tracker, and the energy is estimated from depositions in the calorimeter. Detailed descriptions of the LAT and
its performance can be found in dedicated papers [6, 74].

TABLE I: Summary of the two DM density proﬁles we adopt for the SMC, including J-factor. The J-factor is computed by
integrating to an angular distance of 15◦ from the SMC center; however, the majority of the contribution comes from the
innermost degrees. For example, using the gNFW density proﬁle and integrating to an angular distance of 1◦ yields a J-factor
of 7.98 ± 0.01 × 1018. Parameters for the NFW proﬁle were derived from a ﬁt to the observed rotation curve in Ref. [40]. The
gNFW parameters were instead derived from a best ﬁt to simulated DM halos of similar properties to those of the SMC, see
Ref. [64] and text for details.

The SMC was detected in gamma rays for the ﬁrst time by the LAT [44]. The analysis of 17 months of all-sky
observations led to the detection of an extended source ∼3◦ in size, approximately the angular size of the SMC in
various bands, with a signiﬁcance of about 11σ. The emission is steady and has an integrated > 100 MeV photon ﬂux
of (3.7 ± 0.7) × 10−8 ph/cm2/s. No obvious spatial correlation of the gamma-ray emission with known components
of the SMC was observed, which made it hard to pinpoint the origin of the emission.The spectrum of the emission
was consistent with emission arising from cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium in the SMC, but a
population of high-energy pulsars could also account for a substantial fraction of the signal.

Compared to this early work, about ﬁve times more Fermi-LAT data are now available, and these include improve-
ments in instrument calibration, event reconstruction, and background rejection (i.e. the upgrade from Pass 6 to
Pass 8 data; see Section III B). We have revisited the study of the gamma-ray emission from the SMC based on this
enlarged data set, and the full analysis will be presented elsewhere (Fermi-LAT Collaboration, 2016, in prep.). We
brieﬂy summarize below the results of the analysis, focusing on what is relevant to the present work. Understanding
the methodology and uncertainties associated with the modeling of the gamma-ray emission of the SMC deﬁnes the
limitations of searching for DM signals in this region.
The analysis to develop the SMC model uses Pass 8 SOURCE class events in the energy range 200 MeV–300 GeV
with a zenith angle cut at 100◦. The lower energy bound is determined by the worsening angular resolution, and
declining acceptance, with decreasing energy. We apply the standard selection criteria for good time intervals and
remove data taken in non-standard operating and observing modes. The selection also excludes time periods during
bright GRBs and solar ﬂares. The data set that was used to develop our model for the SMC diﬀuse emission overlaps
with the data set used in the DM search. The emission model is built from a ﬁtting procedure using a maximum
likelihood approach similar to the development of the LMC background model [32].

A. Modeling the SMC

The base model is composed of an isotropic diﬀuse component, a Galactic diﬀuse component,2 and objects listed in
the Fermi -LAT Third Source Catalog (3FGL) [75]. Source 3FGL J0059.0−7242e is not included because it corresponds
to the SMC, for which we sought a new model. The position of weak and soft source 3FGL J0021.6−6835 ((α, δ) =
(5 .◦4,−68 .◦6)) within the region under study had to be reﬁned because the ﬁt resulted in a pair of negative and positive
count residuals and an unphysically soft spectrum for the source. The new source, referred to as PS2 hereafter, best-ﬁt
position is (α, δ) = (5 .◦9,−68 .◦3). In the course of the analysis, an additional point-like source not listed in the 3FGL
was found3, between the SMC and globular cluster 47 Tuc, at position (α, δ) = (10 .◦1,−71 .◦9), referred to as PS1
hereafter. It has a TS in the 25–35 range, depending on the spatial model adopted for the SMC. Its spectrum can be
described by a power law with photon index 1.8.

The remaining emission coincident with the SMC and not accounted for by the base model is then modeled in
several ways. Representing the SMC as a combination of point sources resulted in too many degrees of freedom for
a relatively limited improvement in the maximum likelihood. Using a 2D Gaussian intensity distribution provides a
better likelihood for a smaller number of parameters. The maximum likelihood 2D Gaussian model is centered on
(α, δ) = (14 .◦2,−72 .◦8) with a size σ = 0 .◦8. A combination of 2D Gaussians was also considered as a possible model,
but adding a second Gaussian to the one previously described resulted in only a negligible improvement of the the

maximum likelihood. A more physically motivated model was tested, the so-called emissivity model, similar to what
was performed for the LMC analysis [76]. The emissivity model relies on the assumption that the gamma-ray emission
results from cosmic rays interacting with interstellar gas in the SMC. The aim of this approach is to determine a
spatial distribution for the emissivity, which is the gamma-ray luminosity per H-atom per solid angle and depends on
the actual density and spectrum of cosmic rays threading the gas. We performed an iterative search including sources
with TS ≥25 to ﬁnd the combination of 2D Gaussian emissivity proﬁles that, after multiplication by the gas column
density distribution, provides the overall maximum likelihood to the LAT data. The maximum likelihood model thus
obtained is based on a single 2D Gaussian emissivity proﬁle (compared to 5 for the LMC) in addition to the measured
distribution of gas in the SMC, centered on (α, δ) = (13 .◦2,−72 .◦5) with a size σ = 1 .◦4. The corresponding log
of the maximum likelihood is increased compared to the Gaussian model by about 13, but the signiﬁcance of that
improvement is not easily quantiﬁed because the models are not nested.

Overall, both spatial models can be considered as two alternatives for the spatial modeling of the gamma-ray
emission of the SMC and the slightly higher likelihood of the emissivity model should not be taken as a proof that the
signal originates predominantly in cosmic rays. Using either model, the SMC is detected with a signiﬁcance of nearly
28σ, with an integrated > 100 MeV photon ﬂux of (4.7 ± 0.7) × 10−8 ph/cm2/s (extrapolated from the > 200 MeV
analysis). The maximum likelihood spectral model, among those tested, is a power law with an exponential cutoﬀ at
8 ± 4 GeV that is signiﬁcant at the > 4σ level.

B. Data Selection

For this analysis, we use six years of LAT data (2008 August 4 to 2014 August 5) selecting Pass 8 SOURCE-
class events in the energy range from 500 MeV to 500 GeV in 24 logarithmic energy bins and with 0 .◦1 angular
pixelization. The data selection used in the DM search is very similar to that used to build the background model
described earlier in this section, but is shifted to a higher energy range than the selection used to build the background
model described in Section III. We model the performance of the LAT using the P8R2 SOURCE V6 Instrument Response
Functions (IRFs). The lower limit of 500 MeV was chosen to mitigate both the impact of the increasing width of the
point-spread function at lower energies and the leakage from the Earth’s limb (terrestrial gamma rays).

The data reduction and exposure calculations were performed using the LAT ScienceTools version 10-01-014. The
event selection for the analysis is summarized in Table II. In Figure 2, we show a counts map of the gamma rays in
the SMC ROI and in Figure 3 we show the residual (data - model) map, both for 0.5–500 GeV. The residual map is
consistent with statistical ﬂuctuations indicating the model is in agreement with the data.

IV. ANALYSIS

The analysis techniques we apply in this paper closely follow those used in the LMC analysis [32]. We take the
center of the DM distribution ((cid:96)DM , bDM ) to be the kinematic center of the SMC (see Table II). The parameters of
the DM density proﬁle, the ﬁnal annihilation states and the mass (mχ) deﬁne the search parameters. If an excess
is detected, our goal is to determine the DM mass and annihilation cross section that best ﬁts the observation. If

no excess is found, we set an upper limit on the cross section ((cid:104)σv(cid:105)). The DM density proﬁle which best ﬁts both
the SMC rotation curve and the results from the hydrodynamic cosmological simulation is the generalized NFW, or
gNFW (Section II). Here we also investigate the pure NFW proﬁle that best ﬁts the SMC rotation curve. We ﬁrst brieﬂy
describe the analysis technique we used to constrain the DM annihilation rate. Even though the SMC models ﬁt the
gamma-ray data, the models are empirically ﬁt to the LAT data set. We must take into account degeneracies between
our SMC modeling of the CR background and a potential DM signal. These systematic uncertainties are addressed
later in the section.

To ﬁt the DM template we use a multi-step likelihood ﬁtting procedure that has been previously applied to searches
for DM signals in dwarf spheroidal galaxies [23, 25], the Smith High-Velocity Cloud [77], and the LMC [32]. We ﬁrst
perform a broadband ﬁt over the entire energy range. This broadband ﬁt determines the normalizations of the diﬀuse
sources and of the point-like background sources within 10◦ of the kinematic center of the SMC. We consider sources
over a larger area than the ROI. In this step, the spectral component of the DM annihilation gamma rays is modeled
as a power law (index Γ = 2)5. The spectral shape of the DM in each annihilation channel is taken into account in
the second step of the analysis.

We then scan the likelihood as a function of the ﬂux normalization of the assumed DM signal independently in
each energy bin to create a spectral energy distribution for a source of the spatial morphology that we assume. For
this bin-by-bin scan, we ﬁx the normalizations of the background sources to avoid instabilities resulting from ﬁne
binning in energy and correlations between the Galactic and isotropic diﬀuse components. By analyzing each energy
bin separately, we avoid selecting a single spectral shape to span the entire energy range at the expense of introducing

5 Varying this power-law index by ±0.5 does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the results of the ﬁt.

Section III is outlined in the white solid contour representing 4% of the maximum. The kinematic center of the SMC is the
blue circle with the white “X” through it. Orange stars indicate sources in the 3FGL. Green stars indicate the two additional

additional degrees of freedom into the ﬁt. For the ﬁt in any given bin, the only free parameter describing the DM
component is the normalization.

Since our background model is an empirical description of the SMC region, we must identify and quantify the
degeneracies between the DM models and the components of the background model. We then allow the normalizations
of those components to vary within the statistical uncertainties of the broadband ﬁt when performing the bin-by-bin
ﬁtting. The degenerate components are determined based on their correlation with the spatial morphology of the DM
template. This is described in Section IV B.

The uncertainties associated with each background component are derived from the results of the broadband ﬁt.
To account for the reduced statistics in the bin-by-bin ﬁts, we assign the width of the assumed Gaussian prior on the
background components highly correlated with the dark-matter signal as ten times the uncertainties of the parameters
in the broadband ﬁt as determined empirically from a coverage study described in Section IV B 6. By allowing the
background normalizations in the bin-by-bin ﬁt to vary within uncertainties, we can estimate not only the correlations
between the background and signal models but also the signiﬁcance of any observed excess. From the signiﬁcance, we
can also calculate the upper limit on the cross section for a speciﬁc ﬁnal state as a function of DM mass.

We evaluate the signiﬁcance of the DM hypothesis using the test statistic (TS) deﬁned as:

TS = 2 ln

L(µ, θ|D)
Lnull(θ|D)

(3)

For DM masses up to ∼500 GeV the statistics are large enough that the TS-distribution follows a χ2 distribution
(Chernoﬀ’s theorem [78]) and the signiﬁcance of a given TS value can be calculated from the tail probability of the
χ2 distribution function. As the counts per bin decreases, the χ2 distribution moderately over-predicts the number
of high TS trials observed in simulated data.
The ﬁnal step of the ﬁtting procedure is to convert the bin-by-bin likelihood curve in ﬂux into a likelihood curve in
(cid:104)σv(cid:105) for each spatial proﬁle and annihilation channel, which determines the spectrum. We scan DM masses (mχ) from

limits on the Monte Carlo.

2–10000 GeV (when kinematically allowed in the annihilation channel under consideration), and the pair-annihilation
ﬁnal states listed in Section II. For each DM spectrum, we extract the expected ﬂux, Fj, in each energy bin and
calculate the likelihood of observing that ﬂux value. The log-likelihood in each energy bin is summed to get the
log-likelihood curve, deﬁned as:

(cid:88)

ln L((cid:104)σv(cid:105), µ, θ|D) =

ln Lj((cid:104)σv(cid:105), µ, θj|Dj)

(4)

For each DM mass and channel, we can calculate the maximum likelihood cross section and the 95% CL upper limit
on the cross section.

B. Correlations Between Background and Signal Components

To measure the eﬀect of correlations between background models and the simulated DM signal, in our bin-by-bin
ﬁt we allowed the normalizations of diﬀerent backgrounds to vary within ten times the uncertainties of the parameters
in the broadband ﬁt. The background components we tested for correlations were those nearest the kinematic center
of the SMC and are as follows: the new point source (PS1), two 3FGL sources (3FGL J0029.1−7045 and 3FGL
J0112.9−7506), 47 Tuc, the extended SMC component, and the isotropic and the Galactic diﬀuse backgrounds. The
correlation factor at a given energy between the DM component and the ith background component in energy bin j
can be obtained from the covariance matrices for the parameters once the likelihood function has been maximized:

where σi(j) =(cid:112)covi,i(j) is the variance on the normalizations of the ith model component in the jth energy bin. In

ρi,DM(j) =

(5)

covi,DM(j)
σi(j)σDM(j)

Figure 4, we show the correlation factor between the dark matter and background component as a function of photon
energy for the gNFW and NFW DM proﬁles at the kinematic center of the SMC. We found that the SMC component,
PS1, and the isotropic diﬀuse have the highest correlation factor with the gNFW DM proﬁle, whereas the NFW is most
highly correlated with the SMC component only. Since PS1 has a relatively small ﬂux, also allowing the normalization
to vary in the bin-by-bin ﬁt does not signiﬁcantly change the results.

FIG. 4: Correlation factors, as given by Eq. 5, between the most important components of the background model and the two
DM density proﬁles, gNFW (left) and NFW (right), as a function of photon energy.

For the components that are highly correlated with DM, ﬁxing the normalizations in the bin-by-bin analysis to
the values derived from the broadband ﬁt could result in a potential DM signal being assigned to one of the known
backgrounds. This would result in an overly optimistic set of bounds on DM annihilations since there are large
correlations with several of the SMC background components. In Figure 5, we show the simulated energy bin-by-bin
95% CL exclusion limits for an energy ﬂux from a DM signal with a gNFW morphology. In the left-hand panel, we
use the values from the broadband ﬁt to deﬁne the normalizations for the SMC component and the isotropic diﬀuse
component.
In the right-hand panel, we allow these normalizations to vary within the uncertainties. Especially

at lower energies, the ﬂux upper limits are signiﬁcantly weaker when the normalizations are allowed to vary. This
is due to the uncertainty associated with the correlation between the morphologies. To evaluate the upper limits,
we generated a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the SMC ROI drawn from the background-only model outlined in
Section II and the ﬁtting procedure outlined above. We used 100 trials to construct the expected containment bands
for the upper limits.

FIG. 5: 95% CL upper limit of the gamma-ray ﬂux associated with a gNFW density proﬁle at the kinematic center of the SMC.
In the left-hand panel, we use the values from the broadband ﬁt to deﬁne the normalizations for the SMC component and the
isotropic diﬀuse component. In the right-hand panel, we allow these normalizations to vary within the uncertainties (see text).
The upper limits were determined using an MC simulation of the SMC ROI drawn with no DM contribution. The expected
1σ (green) and 2σ (yellow) containment bands for the upper limits are also shown.

We calculate the expected exclusion curves for a DM annihilation signal from the kinematic center of the SMC
by including a gNFW proﬁle with the simulation of the other components to demonstrate the coverage of our upper
limit calculations. The injected signal7 should lie below the 95% CL upper limit on the cross section in 95% of the
pseudo-experiments. This is demonstrated in Figure 6, where the injected signal falls at nearly the 95% CL upper
limit in the case with a smaller (cid:104)σv(cid:105). The results were similar for the other injected signals. When a larger DM
annihilation signal is injected, the exclusion rate is higher (between the 68% and 95% CL upper limit bands). The
consistency between the injected signal and the observed upper limits demonstrates that our method for setting upper
limits has the correct frequentist coverage. (Note: (cid:104)σv(cid:105) = 1×10−24 cm3/s is 50 times the nominal thermal relic cross
section and has already been well excluded by other searches [23]).

As an additional way to quantify the correlation between the DM annihilation term of the model and the background
components of the model, we have adopted a technique similar to the LMC analysis to estimate the “eﬀective
background” [32] (i.e., the background that overlaps with the signal [80]). We calculate the ratio of signal events to
eﬀective backgrounds and compare it to the statistical uncertainty. Since the only free parameters in the ﬁt are the

normalizations, the statistical uncertainty on the signal is σstat,sig (cid:39) √

If the signal and background models are degenerate, the beﬀ diverges indicating that the model has little power
to distinguish signal from background. Comparing the expected statistical (
beﬀ ) and systematic uncertainties
(∼0.02×beﬀ using Eq. 16 from [32]) we can determine if the analysis is statistics or systematics limited. For each
source component, the eﬀective background and expected counts (N ) are shown in Table III, along with the total
eﬀective background counts for the model with the gNFW proﬁle.

C. Alternative SMC Background Modeling

In Section III, we described two methods for modeling the SMC. For the main results of this analysis we used the
model that provided the overall maximum likelihood, the one-component emissivity model. We repeated the analysis
using the alternative 2D Gaussian to model the SMC. This allows the sensitivity of the DM limits to the background
model of the SMC to be estimated. We allowed the isotropic diﬀuse and the 2D Gaussian model to vary within
ten times the statistical uncertainties as determined by the broadband ﬁt when we introduced a DM component. In
Figure 7, we show the resulting ﬂux upper limits. For the bands we used the same MC simulation derived from the
emissivity model shown in the right-hand panel of Figure 5. The ﬂux upper limits of the 2D Gaussian SMC model are
mostly within the two sigma bands of the MC simulation of the emissivity SMC model illustrating suﬃcient agreement
between the two models.

We ﬁnd that overall the largest contributor to the systematic uncertainty is the correlations with the backgrounds
as described in Section IV B. These uncertainties are large enough that in our ﬁnal results we do not explicitly consider
the modeling uncertainties suggested by the comparison we made here.

V. RESULTS

We can now set constraints on the annihilation of DM into Standard Model particles that result in gamma rays.
We report the 95% CL upper limit on the annihilation cross section for the b¯b, τ +τ− channels. These channels were
previously considered in the dwarf spheroidal analyses [23, 25]. We evaluate cross section limits for the gNFW and the
NFW DM distributions considered in Section II. Since these two distributions also represented the highest and lowest
J-factor estimates, the results can also be interpreted as optimistic and conservative limits respectively.
Since the one component emissivity background model of the SMC is highly correlated with both the gNFW and
NFW proﬁles (see Figure 4) and the model is data driven, we ﬁrst wanted to measure (cid:104)σv(cid:105) under the assumption that
all the gamma rays from the SMC region are attributable to DM annihilation. We evaluated the ﬂux dependence
of the maximum of the likelihood function, shown in the left-hand panel of Figure 8. As expected, when only a
gNFW template is used (and the SMC template is neglected), the likelihood analysis would indicate a signiﬁcant DM
component, especially in the low energy (<10 GeV) bins. If this excess could be attributed entirely to DM annihilation
it would follow the predicted spectral energy distribution for that process. The right-hand panel shows the Maximum
Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of the energy ﬂux per energy bin. The MLE prediction of the ﬂux is ﬁt to a DM spectral
template where the normalization ((cid:104)σv(cid:105)) is ﬁt with four diﬀerent DM masses. The ﬁt is performed by assembling a
global likelihood from the bin-by-bin likelihoods and the global likelihood is maximized to derive the normalization.
In this ﬁgure, only the b¯b channel is shown; however, similar results were obtained for the τ +τ− channel. Since a pure
DM annihilation spectrum is not a good ﬁt to the observed spectrum, the majority of the gamma rays from the SMC
are not from DM annihilation. Furthermore, the implied MLE cross sections are large and have been excluded by the
dwarf spheroidal DM searches [23]. This further supports the conclusion that the gamma-ray emission from the SMC
is not dominantly from DM annihilation unless the J-factor is implausibly larger than the values we derived.

Since a pure DM annihilation spectrum is not a good ﬁt to the observed spectrum of the SMC region and the implied
DM cross section has already been excluded by other studies, we include the emissivity model of the SMC to derive
upper limits on the annihilation cross sections for the two choices for the DM density proﬁle. In Figures 9 and 10 we
show the 95% CL upper bounds for the b¯b and τ +τ− annihilation channels for the gNFW and NFW proﬁles. There are
no obvious features in the mass dependence of these limits, except the dip in the observed limit at lower DM masses
for the gNFW proﬁle. This could result from a ﬂuctuation in the data, or an overestimation of the correlation of the
DM signal with the backgrounds at low masses. The highest TS value measured is ∼4 in the τ +τ− channel using the
NFW proﬁle. This is shown as the slight excess in Figure 9 at 10 GeV. In these ﬁgures, we also see that the two proﬁles
set nearly the same constraints in both channels. This is not surprising since, although the gNFW proﬁle has a larger
J-factor than the NFW proﬁle, it is also more highly correlated with the SMC baryonic template (especially at higher

FIG. 8: The left-hand panel shows the change in the logarithm of the likelihood as a function of the ﬂux of the DM component
which follows a gNFW proﬁle centered at the SMC kinematic center. The proﬁles are truncated at −∆lnL >10. Upper limits
on the integrated energy ﬂux are set at 95% CL within each bin where the log-likelihood has decreased by 2.71/2 from its
maximum [20]. The right-hand panel shows the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of the energy ﬂux per energy bin.
At lower energies, the ﬂux is ﬁt with four diﬀerent DM masses in the b¯b channel (similar results were obtained for the τ +τ−
channel). The resulting best ﬁts of the normalizations correspond to a (cid:104)σv(cid:105) for each mass; however, the (cid:104)σv(cid:105) for all four DM
masses and both channels have already been excluded [23].

masses). In the case of the NFW proﬁle, we can exclude the canonical thermal cross section for DM up to ∼7 GeV in
the τ +τ− channel. This is consistent with the results from the dwarf spheroidal and LMC analyses [23, 25, 32]. When
using the gNFW proﬁle, we cannot exclude the canonical thermal cross section in the b¯b channel at any mass, and only
up to ∼2 GeV in the τ +τ− channel. Several studies have shown that in the Galactic center when the annihilation
channel has a large leptonic component (i.e., the τ +τ− case), secondary emission is important to consider in particular
at high masses (mχ >1000 GeV) [53, 81–84]. In the case of the SMC, the strengths of both the magnetic ﬁeld and
the Interstellar Radiation Field (ISRF) are smaller than in the Galactic center [44], and the gas densities are not any
greater. It is most likely that the signal from the secondaries would have a similar spatial distribution as the other
classical backgrounds, making it diﬃcult to disentangle the signal and background components in the ﬁt. We estimate
that if the secondary emission was distinguishable from classical backgrounds, considering it would improve the limits
at Eγ <1 GeV and for mχ >1000 GeV by 20%, which is subdominant to other statistical and systematic eﬀects.

The expectation bands in Figures 9 and 10 are derived from the same 100 MC trials that were used in deriving the
ﬂux upper limits in the right-hand panel Figure 5. See Section IV B. This correlation is the largest uncertainty in our
limits, in particular at energies less than 100 GeV. We ﬁnd that the observed limits are weaker than the predicted
limits over most of the mass range for both channels when using the gNFW spectral model for the DM component.
This indicates that letting the background components most correlated with the DM signal vary within uncertainties
in the bin-by-bin ﬁt is not a perfect method to take the correlation of the components into account. However, our
observed limits using the NFW proﬁle are consistent and in some cases more constraining than indicated by the MC
simulations.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The SMC is the second largest satellite of the Milky Way and contains an amount of DM that would result in a
DM annihilation signal at Earth as large as the brightest dwarf galaxies. Although it has less DM than the LMC, and
is slightly more distant, it also has less interstellar gas and massive star formation, and fewer conventional sources of
gamma rays.

Given the enormous interest in the possible detection of a DM signal from the Galactic center, the advantages of
the SMC makes it an excellent target for analysis with F ermi-LAT gamma-ray data. This work provides the ﬁrst
constraints on the annihilation of DM into Standard Model particles from observations of the SMC. Consideration
of both hydrodynamical cosmological simulations and the observed rotation curve indicates that the DM density
proﬁle is best described by either a gNFW or an NFW proﬁle. We based our search for a DM annihilation signal on six
years of F ermi-LAT data over a 10◦×10◦ ROI centered at the SMC. To derive a model for the gamma-ray emission

from the SMC, we employed a physical emissivity model which yielded a one-component description of the SMC
(Fermi-LAT Collaboration, 2016, in prep.). We place upper limits on the velocity-averaged cross section that reach
the benchmark canonical thermal freeze-out value for DM with an NFW up to ∼7 GeV in the τ +τ− channel. Compared
to the expectation given the SMC baryonic model and the DM proﬁles, the limits we found were modestly weaker
than expected. No DM annihilation signal was found to be statistically signiﬁcant, the largest being slightly greater
than 2σ. An interpretation of the signiﬁcance should also consider a trials factor, which further reduces the value.

The main source of uncertainty is correlations between the SMC gamma-ray emission model and the gNFW and
NFW DM proﬁles. We found that these DM proﬁles are highly correlated with components of our SMC background
model and this is the largest source of uncertainty. The correlation between these components weakens the limits, in
particular in the energy range associated with the excess near the Galactic center.

Both DM proﬁles yielded similar limits and are either competitive with or exceed the existing limits from any

the analysis. The horizontal dashed line shows the thermal relic cross section [79].

individual dwarf spheroidal galaxy. However, the limits are weaker than the limit from a joint analysis of the dwarf
spheroidal galaxies. The limits we found are also comparable to the more conservative limits derived from the analysis
of the LMC. In Figure 11, we compare the bounds set for the b¯b channel using the NFW proﬁle, the LMC analysis
which used Pass 7 Rep data and a more realistic sim-mean proﬁle [32], and the most recent F ermi-LAT analysis of
the dwarf spheroidal galaxies [23]. We expected to ﬁnd stronger or comparable bounds across the entire mass range,
but did not due to correlations of the DM proﬁles with components of the SMC background. In the ﬁgure, we also
show our limits compared with the values preferred by analyses of the Galactic center excess [10, 12, 85, 86]. The
ellipses shown in the ﬁgure are meant to illustrate the parameter space of interest and do not include uncertainties
on (cid:104)σv(cid:105) due to the uncertainties of the corresponding DM density proﬁles.

A better understanding of the populations of cosmic rays and high energy sources in the SMC would help disam-
biguate astrophysical emission from DM signals. In this study, our approach was conservative, resulting in robust
bounds. More accurate simulations of the Magellanic system eventually will be made possible using the results of
stellar surveys, such as GAIA [87], and would give greater conﬁdence in both the morphological shape of the expected
DM signal and value of the J-factor. Nevertheless, the present work and the LMC analysis [32] already demonstrate
the potential of DM searches in complicated systems such as the Magellanic Clouds.
