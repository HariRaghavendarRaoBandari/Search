ABSTRACT
We compare the predictions of a semi-analytic model for ultra-compact dwarf galaxy
(UCD) formation by tidal stripping to the observed properties of globular clusters
(GCs) and UCDs in the Fornax and Virgo clusters. For Fornax we ﬁnd the predicted
number of stripped nuclei agrees very well with the excess number of GCs+UCDs
above the GC luminosity function. GCs+UCDs with masses >107.3 M⊙ are consistent
with being entirely formed by tidal stripping. Stripped nuclei can also account for Virgo
UCDs with masses >107.3 M⊙ where numbers are complete by mass. For both Fornax
and Virgo, the predicted velocity dispersions and radial distributions of stripped nuclei
are consistent with that of UCDs within ∼50-100 kpc but disagree at larger distances
where dispersions are too high and radial distributions too extended. Stripped nuclei
are predicted to have radially biased anisotropies at all radii, agreeing with Virgo
UCDs at clustercentric distances larger than 50 kpc. However, ongoing disruption is
not included in our model which would cause orbits to become tangentially biased
at small radii. We ﬁnd the predicted metallicities and central black hole masses of
stripped nuclei agree well with the metallicities and implied black hole masses of UCDs
for masses >106.5 M⊙. The predicted black hole masses also agree well with that of
M60-UCD1, the ﬁrst UCD with a conﬁrmed central black hole. These results suggest
that observed GC+UCD populations are a combination of genuine GCs and stripped
nuclei, with the contribution of stripped nuclei increasing toward the high-mass end.

INTRODUCTION

Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) are a new type of
galaxy discovered just over 15 years ago in spectroscopic
surveys of the Fornax galaxy cluster with sizes (Re .
100 pc) and luminosities (−14 . MV . −12) interme-
diate between globular clusters (GCs) and dwarf galaxies
(Hilker et al. 1999a; Drinkwater et al. 2000). Follow-up high
resolution spectroscopy has found that UCDs have simi-
lar internal velocity dispersions to dwarf elliptical nuclei
(σ ∼30 km s−1, Drinkwater et al. 2003). Initially labelled
UCDs (Phillipps et al. 2001) or dwarf-globular transition
objects (Ha¸segan et al. 2005) their formation mechanism is
still under debate, however two main scenarios have been
suggested: they may be the high-mass end of the GC mass
function observed around galaxies with rich GC systems

Through dedicated surveys many new UCDs have been
found (Mieske, Hilker, & Infante 2004a; Firth et al. 2007;
Firth, Drinkwater, & Karick 2008; Gregg et al. 2009), to
the point where the conﬁrmed objects now number in the
hundreds in the Fornax cluster alone (Mieske et al. 2012).
UCDs have since been discovered in many environments,
including other galaxy clusters (Abell 1689: Mieske et al.

(NGC 7252: Maraston et al. 2004; Sombrero: Hau et al.
2009; NGC4546: Norris & Kannappan 2011). As more
UCDs are found there is growing evidence that no single for-
mation mechanism is responsible for their formation, how-
ever most UCDs either formed as giant GCs or by tidal
stripping of nucleated dwarf galaxies (Ha¸segan et al. 2005;
Mieske et al. 2006; Brodie et al. 2011; Chilingarian et al.
2011; Da Rocha et al. 2011; Norris & Kannappan 2011;
Norris et al. 2014; Pfeﬀer et al. 2014). Although the forma-
tion mechanism of a few peculiar objects can be determined
(e.g. Seth et al. 2014; Norris et al. 2015), disentangling the
individual formation mechanism of most UCDs is almost
impossible due to the similar predictions of internal UCD
properties from each formation scenario. Determining the
origin of UCDs therefore requires detailed predictions of
how much each possible formation mechanism contributes
to UCD populations.

Tidal

stripping of nucleated galaxies

is a likely
origin for many UCDs
(and a conﬁrmed origin for
two objects, Seth et al. 2014; Norris et al. 2015) how-
ever their contribution to the total UCD population is
uncertain (and partly compounded by the various def-
initions of UCDs). Previous studies have shown that
tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies can produce objects
with similar properties to observed UCDs (Bekki et al.
2003; Pfeﬀer & Baumgardt 2013). A number of studies
presented estimates
for the number of UCDs formed
due to tidal disruption (Bekki et al. 2003; Goerdt et al.
2008; Thomas, Drinkwater & Evstigneeva 2008). However
as these estimates were based on UCD formation in clusters
with static potentials they suﬀer from a number of problems.
Static models do not take into account UCD formation that
may have occurred within subclusters that later fell into
the main cluster. Since galaxy clusters are expected to un-
dergo many mergers during their formation, galaxies in clus-
ters may be on chaotic orbits providing a few close pericen-
tre passages necessary for UCD formation but far from the
cluster centre at other times (Pfeﬀer & Baumgardt 2013)1.
Galaxies orbiting in clusters may also have interactions with
other satellite galaxies thereby making tidal disruption more
likely.

In Pfeﬀer et al. (2014, hereafter P14) we presented the
ﬁrst model for UCD formation based on cosmological simu-
lations of galaxy formation. Our model uses a semi-analytic
galaxy formation model to select possible UCD progenitor
galaxies and to determine when they become disrupted by
tidal forces. Assuming that galaxies at high redshift have the
same distribution of nucleus-to-galaxy mass and nucleation
fraction as galaxies in the present day Universe we deter-
mined the numbers and masses of UCDs formed by tidal
stripping. Some preliminary analysis was presented compar-
ing the number of UCDs predicted with the observed num-
ber in the Fornax cluster, ﬁnding at most ∼10 per cent of
UCDs have formed by tidal stripping.

In this paper we compare in detail the predictions of
the P14 model with the properties of UCDs from the Fornax
and Virgo clusters. In particular we compare the predicted

ability of tidal stripping to form UCDs.

mass functions, radial and velocity distributions, metallici-
ties and central black hole masses with the observed distri-
butions. Throughout the paper we refer to objects formed
in the simulation by tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies as
stripped nuclei since such objects may resemble both GCs
and UCDs and because the observed UCD populations may
be the result of more than one formation channel.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes
the criteria for selecting analogue galaxy clusters of the For-
nax and Virgo clusters and brieﬂy summarises the method
of P14 for identifying stripped nuclei in cosmological simu-
lations. Section 3 describes the compilation of observational
data of GCs, UCDs and dwarf galaxies. Section 4 presents
the results comparing the simulation and observational data.
In Section 5 and 6 we discuss the implications of our work
for UCD formation scenarios and summarize our results.

2 SEMI-ANALYTIC MODELLING

Here we summarize the stripped nucleus formation model of
P14 and detail our selection criteria for comparing against
observed galaxy clusters.

The model makes use of the semi-analytic galaxy forma-
tion model (SAM) of Guo et al. (2011, hereafter G11) which
was applied to the subhalo merger trees of the Millennium-
II simulation (Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2009, hereafter MS-II).
The MS-II is a cosmological dark-matter only simulation
which has a box size of 137 Mpc and a particle mass of
9.42 × 106 M⊙. The G11 SAM is constrained by low-redshift
galaxy abundance and clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey and is tuned to reproduce the z = 0 mass dis-
tribution of galaxies down to stellar masses of 107.5 M⊙.
In the G11 SAM satellite galaxies (i.e. those currently or
previously at the centre of non-dominant haloes orbiting
within a more massive halo) may have either resolved or
unresolved dark matter (DM) haloes under the assumption
that the stellar component of a satellite galaxy is harder to
disrupt than its halo. For the stellar component of a satel-
lite galaxy to be disrupted its DM halo must ﬁrst be en-
tirely dissolved (i.e. become unresolved). Since tidal strip-
ping is not taken into account in the model, satellite galax-
ies do not lose stellar mass until they are completely dis-
rupted. For all data associated with MS-II and the G11
SAM we assume a cosmology consistent with the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe 1-year data (WMAP1) results
(Spergel et al. 2003) and assume h = 0.73 for all masses
and distances2. The data associated with the MS-II and
G11 SAM are publicly provided by the Virgo-Millennium
Database (Lemson & Virgo Consortium 2006)3.

In P14 a sample of galaxy clusters was chosen such
that Mvir > 1013 M⊙/h. Here we limit the cluster sam-
ple according to the mass of the cluster we are comparing
with. For the Fornax cluster we choose all clusters within
the range Mvir = 7 ± 2 × 1013 M⊙ (Drinkwater et al. 2001),

2 In P14 we tested semi-analytic models for both a WMAP1
(Guo et al. 2011) and WMAP7 cosmology (Guo et al. 2013), ﬁnd-
ing no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the predictions. Therefore
modelling with an updated cosmology would not change our re-
sults.

giving 37 clusters for comparison. For the Virgo cluster we
choose all clusters within the range Mvir = (1.4–7)×1014 M⊙
(McLaughlin 1999; Tonry et al. 2000; Urban et al. 2011),
giving 13 clusters for comparison.

After the SAM clusters are chosen, stripped nuclei are

identiﬁed in the simulations in the following way:

(i) The galaxy merger trees of all galaxies in the SAM
clusters at z = 0 are searched for possible stripped nucleus
progenitors (hereafter referred to as candidate galaxies and
the DM halo of the galaxies as candidate haloes). A galaxy
is deﬁned as a possible progenitor when the stellar mass
exceeds 107.5 M⊙ (i.e. all progenitors of the candidate galaxy
have a stellar mass less than this limit). This lower mass
cut is chosen based on the lower mass limit observed for
nucleated galaxies (see ﬁgure 1 of P14).

(ii) To form a stripped nucleus the candidate galaxy must
undergo a merger with a more massive galaxy and the stellar
component of the galaxy be completely disrupted according
to the criteria in the SAM (equation 30 of G11). It is as-
sumed that during this process the nuclear cluster of the
galaxy is not disrupted since it is much more compact than
the galaxy (Bekki et al. 2003; Pfeﬀer & Baumgardt 2013).
(iii) The galaxy merger must be a minor merger4, where
a minor merger is deﬁned as those with ‘dynamical’ mass
ratios smaller than 1:3. The dynamical mass Mdyn is deﬁned
as Mdyn = M∗ + Mgas + MDM(< rs) where M∗ is the stellar
mass of the galaxy, Mgas is the cold gas mass and MDM(< rs)
is the mass of the DM halo within the NFW scale radius.

(iv) The candidate galaxy merged5 (i.e. the stellar com-
ponent of the galaxy was disrupted according to the SAM)
at least 2 Gyr ago so there is enough time to form a UCD
(Pfeﬀer & Baumgardt 2013).

tfriction

(v) The dynamical

friction time of the stripped nu-
cleus
(determined using equation 7-26 from
Binney & Tremaine 1987) is calculated at the snapshot be-
fore the candidate galaxy is disrupted. After a time tfriction
the stripped nucleus is assumed to merge with the centre
of the galaxy it is orbiting and therefore be completely dis-
rupted. This diﬀers from the treatment of dynamical friction
in P14 where the dynamical friction time was calculated for
the halo the stripped nucleus is associated with at z = 0.
We ﬁnd the predictions of the model are unaﬀected by this
change.

After the candidate galaxy is disrupted the stripped nu-
cleus takes the position and velocity of the most bound par-
ticle of the candidate halo (similar to galaxies without re-
solved haloes in the G11 SAM). We also take into account
orbital decay of the stripped nuclei due to dynamical fric-
tion by modifying the distance of the stripped nuclei from
their host galaxies by a factor (1 − ∆t/tfriction), where ∆t
is the time since the progenitor galaxy was disrupted (this

4 It is important to note that in the minor merger process we ex-
pect the candidate galaxy was disrupted by the tidal ﬁeld of the
host galaxy. In this case the nuclear cluster of the galaxy is not dis-
rupted and forms a UCD (Bekki et al. 2003; Pfeﬀer & Baumgardt
2013). In the case of a major merger the nuclei of the two galaxies
merge and a UCD is not produced.
5 Galaxy mergers in the model are assumed to happen on a time
scale shorter than the time between simulation snapshots (a max-
imum of 377 Myr) which may not be true in reality.

is identical to the treatment of satellite galaxies in the G11
SAM). The velocity of the stripped nucleus relative to the
host galaxy was kept the same as the velocity of the most
bound particle relative to the host halo (to account for galax-
ies undergoing orbital decay in the SAM).

The two main assumptions for assigning physical prop-

erties to the stripped nuclei are the following:

(i) The stripped nucleus is assigned a mass randomly
chosen from a log-normal mass function for the nucleus-
to-galaxy mass ratio Mnuc/M∗,gal (where the mass of the
candidate galaxy is taken immediately before disruption).
Based on ﬁgure 14 from Cˆot´e et al. (2006), we choose a
mean of 0.3 per cent and a log-normal standard deviation
of 0.5 dex. Tidal stripping of the stripped nuclei is not
taken into account. Recently, Georgiev et al. (2016) found
Mnuc/M∗,gal ≃ 0.1 per cent in both early- and late-type
galaxies, lower than the value we assumed. Therefore when
comparing mass functions in Section 4.1 we also consider
this value for the nucleus-to-galaxy mass ratio.

(ii) The fraction of galaxies that are nucleated is taken
from observations of galaxies in the Virgo and Fornax clus-
ters (see ﬁgure 1 of P14). For galaxies between stellar masses
of 3.0×107 and 4.7×108 M⊙ we choose a nucleation fraction
that varies linearly (in log-space) between 0 and 80 per cent.
Between stellar masses of 4.7 × 108 and 1011 M⊙ we take an
average nucleation fraction of 80 per cent. For galaxies above
stellar masses of 1011 M⊙ we assume nuclear clusters are de-
stroyed by supermassive black holes (e.g. Graham & Spitler
2009). Where possible, to improve our statistics we work
with fractions of stripped nuclei instead of randomly choos-
ing galaxies to satisfy the nucleated fraction.

3 OBSERVATIONAL DATA

For all data associated with the Fornax cluster we use the
distance modulus m − M = 31.39 mag (Freedman et al.
2001) corresponding to a distance of 19 Mpc and a spa-
tial scale of 92 pc arcsec−1. For all data associated with the
Virgo cluster we use the distance modulus m − M = 31.09
mag (Mei et al. 2007) corresponding to a distance of 16.5
Mpc and a spatial scale of 80 pc arcsec−1.

3.1 Fornax cluster

3.1.1 GCs and UCDs

of

objects

the number and luminosities

Since UCDs were discovered, the GC and UCD pop-
the Fornax cluster has been the subject
ulation of
of many studies. To determine the number of
spec-
troscopically conﬁrmed GCs+UCDs in Fornax we com-
pile
from
Hilker et al. (1999a), Drinkwater et al. (2000), Mieske et al.
(2002, 2004a), Bergond et al. (2007), Hilker et al. (2007),
Firth et al. (2007), Mieske et al. (2008), Gregg et al. (2009),
Schuberth et al. (2010), Chilingarian et al. (2011) and Puzia
& Hilker (priv. comm.). The total number of conﬁrmed
GCs+UCDs in the Fornax cluster is 935. Due to the 2dF
Fornax surveys of Drinkwater et al. (2000) and Gregg et al.
(2009),
the number of GCs+UCDs with luminosities
brighter than MV < −11.5 mag are more than 95 per cent
complete within a clustercentric radius of 0.9 degrees, or

4

J. Pfeﬀer et al.

∼300 kpc. As most studies concentrated on the inner 15 acr-
min of the cluster, or <83 kpc, the number of GCs+UCDs
with luminosities MV < −10.25 is approximately complete
within 50 kpc and the completeness drops to below 70
per cent beyond this radius (see discussion in Mieske et al.
2012).

To compare the model predictions with the observed
population it is necessary to derive masses for the GCs
and UCDs from population synthesis models. GCs are gen-
erally very old (∼ 13 Gyr, Mar´ın-Franch et al. 2009) and
are consistent with having a Kroupa/Chabrier stellar ini-
tial mass function (IMF; e.g. McLaughlin & van der Marel
2005; Paust et al. 2010). Note that GCs actually show a
spread in MFs due to ongoing dissolution, however at the
high mass end for GCs which we are interested in this
is not important (Baumgardt & Makino 2003). UCDs on
the other hand are on average slightly younger than GCs
(∼ 11 Gyr, Francis et al. 2012). Many UCDs have dy-
namical mass-to-light (M/L) ratios above what can be ex-
plained by stellar population models (Ha¸segan et al. 2005;
Dabringhausen et al. 2008; Mieske et al. 2013). One sugges-
tion is that the elevated M/L ratios are due to a top-
heavy IMF (Dabringhausen, Kroupa, & Baumgardt 2009;
Dabringhausen et al. 2012, although see also Phillipps et al.
2013). Therefore an IMF leading to higher masses should
also be considered. To determine the eﬀect of the assumed
stellar population on our results we consider a number of
diﬀerent IMFs and simple stellar population (SSP) models.
We use the Maraston (2005, M05) SSP model with Kroupa
(2001) and Salpeter (1955) IMFs and the Bruzual & Charlot
(2003, BC03) SSP model with a Chabrier (2003) IMF. Each
SSP model is generated for two diﬀerent ages, 11 and 13 Gyr.
For the M05 models we tested both blue (bHB) and red hor-
izontal branch (rHB) models but ﬁnd no diﬀerence between
the results and therefore only consider the rHB models here-
after. Masses for the GCs+UCDs were then calculated from
the (V −I)-M/LV relation ﬁtted to the diﬀerent SSP models
(see also Misgeld & Hilker 2011). Given the observed prop-
erties of GCs and UCDs the Kroupa/Chabrier SSP mod-
els are the most reasonable. The Salpeter IMF (which is
a bottom-heavy IMF compared to Kroupa/Chabrier) rep-
resents the case of elevated M/L ratios. In terms of mass,
the completeness of MV < −11.5 mag within 300 kpc cor-
responds to M & 106.9 M⊙ for the Kroupa/Chabrier SSP
models.

To estimate the completeness of the Fornax sample
within 83 kpc in terms of mass we compare the number of
spectroscopically conﬁrmed GCs+UCDs with the GC lumi-
nosity function (GCLF, derived from photometry, where the
errors come from uncertainties in background corrections)
within 83 kpc (6, 450 ± 700 GCs, Dirsch et al. 2003) and 300
kpc (11, 100±2, 400 GCs, Gregg et al. 2009, derived from the
data of Bassino et al. 2006). It is assumed that the GCLF
has a Gaussian shape with a width σ = 1.3 mag and peak
MV = −7.6 mag (Dirsch et al. 2003). We convert the GCLF
to a mass function for a given SSP model/IMF assuming a
constant M/L ratio given by median of the GC+UCD sam-
ple (to be dominated by objects with masses ∼ 106 M⊙)
using 13 Gyr ages. In Fig. 1 we compare the number of
spectroscopically conﬁrmed GCs+UCDs with the GCLF for
each SSP model. Comparing the results of all SSP models

for the GC+UCD sample with the GCLF we estimate a
completeness limit of ∼ 106.7 M⊙ within 83 kpc.

3.1.2 Dwarf galaxies

We take the sample of Fornax dwarf galaxies from the For-
nax Cluster Catalogue (FCC, Ferguson 1989) with updated
radial velocities from Thomas et al. (2008). We exclude one
galaxy (FCC2) as a background galaxy due to its high line-
of-sight velocity (cz = 4540 km s−1) compared to the clus-
ter (cz ∼ 1500 km s−1, Gregg et al. 2009). The catalogue is
complete to BT ∼ 18 mag, or MB ∼ −13.4 mag, and there-
fore we take this as the lower luminosity limit for the sample.
Assuming a stellar mass-to-light ratio M/LB = 3 (M/L)⊙
(typical for dwarf ellipticals, Chilingarian 2009) this corre-
sponds to a stellar mass M∗ = 108 M⊙. A galaxy is consid-
ered to be a dwarf galaxy if it has a luminosity MB > −19.6,
corresponding to M < 1010.5 M⊙ for M/LB = 3 (M/L)⊙.
Therefore when comparing against dwarf galaxies in the
FCC, we choose dwarf galaxies in the simulations that have
stellar masses 108 < M∗/ M⊙ < 1010.5.

3.2 Virgo cluster

3.2.1 GCs and UCDs

The recent Next Generation Virgo cluster Survey (NGVS,
Ferrarese et al. 2012), together with spectroscopic follow-
up (Zhang et al. 2015), allows for a systematic comparison
with UCDs in the Virgo cluster. Virgo cluster UCDs, specif-
ically UCDs around the central galaxy M87, were therefore
taken from Zhang et al. (2015). Objects selected from the
NGVS have luminosities Mg 6 −9.6 mag and eﬀective radii
Re > 11 pc, while previously conﬁrmed objects selected
from HST imaging (Brodie et al. 2011) have eﬀective radii
Re > 9.5 pc. All UCDs selected have an upper size limit
Re . 100 pc. The total number of UCDs in the Zhang et al.
(2015) catalogue is 97. The number of UCDs is expected to
be nearly 100 per cent complete within 288 kpc for g < 20.5
mag. However, in the Zhang et al. (2015) study UCDs are
deﬁned by eﬀective radius (10 . Re/pc . 100) while in our
model we can currently only compare objects by mass. With
this shortcoming in mind, in this work we give basic com-
parisons between Virgo UCDs and our model. More detailed
analysis therefore requires observations that are complete
above a given mass or a model which can predict stripped
nuclei sizes.

To derive masses for the Zhang et al. (2015) sample of
UCDs we follow the method of Misgeld & Hilker (2011). The
apparent gAB-band magnitudes were transformed into ab-
solute V -band magnitudes using the relation V = gAB +
0.026−0.307×(gz)AB given in Peng et al. (2006) and a Virgo
distance modulus of 31.09 mag (Mei et al. 2007). Mass-
to-light ratios M/LV were calculated assuming a M/LV -
(g − z)AB relation according to Maraston (2005) single stel-
lar population models (Kroupa IMF, red horizontal branch)
for ages of 11 and 13 Gyr (Misgeld & Hilker 2011). For ob-
jects H30772 and S887 we take z-band magnitudes from
Jord´an et al. (2009). For the luminosity completeness limit
g < 20.5 mag, this corresponds to a completeness in mass of
M & 106.6 M⊙.

To compare velocity dispersions of stripped nuclei with

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18

GCs we use the sample of GCs compiled by Strader et al.
(2011, excluding any UCDs deﬁned in Zhang et al. 2015).
For comparing radial number proﬁles of GCs around M87
we use the S´ersic proﬁles ﬁtted by Zhang et al. (2015) to the
surface number density proﬁles for blue [0.55 < (g′ − i′)0 <
0.80] and red [0.80 < (g′ − i′)0 < 1.15] GCs (20 < g′
0 < 24)
determined by Durrell et al. (2014) using NGVS photome-
try. The proﬁles for the blue and red GCs were ﬁtted within
240 and 120 kpc from M87, respectively.

3.2.2 Dwarf galaxies

For comparing the radial distribution of Virgo cluster galax-
ies we take the sample of dwarf galaxies from the Virgo Clus-
ter Catalogue (VCC, Binggeli et al. 1985, excluding galaxies
classiﬁed as background galaxies). The catalogue is com-
plete to BT ∼ 18 mag, or MB ∼ −13.1 mag. As for the
Fornax cluster, we assume a typical mass-to-light ratio of
M/LB = 3 (M/L)⊙ and use a stellar mass cut when com-
paring with simulations of 108 < M∗/ M⊙ < 1010.5.

For comparing velocities of Virgo cluster galaxies we
take the sample of dwarf galaxies from the Extended Virgo
Cluster Catalogue (EVCC, Kim et al. 2014). Masses for the
dwarf galaxies were again estimated following the method
of Misgeld & Hilker (2011). The apparent gAB-band mag-
nitudes were transformed into absolute V -band magnitudes
using the relation given in Peng et al. (2006). Mass-to-light
ratios M/LV were calculated assuming a M/LV -(g − z)AB
relation according to Maraston (2005) single stellar popula-
tion models (Kroupa IMF, blue horizontal branch) for ages
of 11 Gyr. For comparison with the simulations we use a
mass cut of 108 < M∗/ M⊙ < 1010.5.

3.3 GC and UCD metallicities

We compile a list of GC and UCD metallicities for For-
nax and Virgo cluster GCs and UCDs from Mieske et al.
(2008), Chilingarian et al. (2011) and Francis et al. (2012).
Where possible we use the dynamical masses measured
for objects in this sample. For common objects between
the Mieske et al. (2008) and Chilingarian et al. (2011) sam-
ples we take data from Chilingarian et al.. For common
objects between the Mieske et al. (2008) and Francis et al.
(2012) samples we take data from Francis et al.. For the
Chilingarian et al. sample we use the dynamical mass-to-
light ratios to calculate the UCD masses where possible.
For the Francis et al. sample we take dynamical masses from
Mieske et al. (2013) for objects UCD1, UCD5, VUCD3 and
VUCD5. For the other objects masses were calculated us-
ing the g and r colours and the stellar mass-to-light re-
lations of Bell et al. (2003). For NGC1407-GC1 the g and
r colours were taken from Romanowsky et al. (2009). For
NGC1407 we assume a distance modulus of 31.99 mag
(Jerjen, Tully, & Trentham 2004).

number of conﬁrmed Fornax GCs+UCDs compiled in Sec-
tion 3.1 and the GCLF within 83 kpc (Dirsch et al. 2003)
and 300 kpc (Gregg et al. 2009, derived from the data of
Bassino et al. 2006) for each SSP model. The luminosity
functions were converted to mass functions using a mass-
to-light ratio given by the median of the Fornax GC+UCD
sample for a given SSP model/IMF with an age of 13 Gyr.
The luminosity function is approximated as a Gaussian with
a width σ = 1.3 mag and peak magnitude of MV = −7.6
mag (Dirsch et al. 2003) with a total of 6, 450 ± 700 GCs
within 83 kpc (Dirsch et al. 2003) and 11, 100 ± 2, 400 GCs
within 300 kpc (Gregg et al. 2009). The ﬁgure suggests an
excess of ∼ 10 GCs+UCDs with masses & 107 M⊙ compared
to the GC mass function. As noted by Gregg et al. (2009),
given the low number of objects at the high mass/luminosity
end, the number of UCDs is consistent with being the
high-mass tail of the GC mass function. The most mas-
sive Fornax UCD (UCD3) is also very extended (Reﬀ = 90
pc, Hilker et al. 2007) while all other Fornax UCDs have
sizes less than 30 pc (e.g. Misgeld & Hilker 2011). This
may indicate UCD3 is not part of the GC mass function
even if its mass is consistent with being part of it (al-
though GCs+UCDs formed by hierarchical merging of star
clusters in cluster complexes may also reach such sizes,
Br¨uns & Kroupa 2012). However, unlike M60-UCD1 (the
most massive UCD in the Virgo cluster) which has a su-
permassive black hole (SMBH) containing 15 per cent of its
mass and which was most likely formed by tidal stripping
(Seth et al. 2014), UCD3 does not seem to have a SMBH (at
least not one containing more than 5 per cent of its mass,
Frank et al. 2011).

As already noted in P14, for masses more than 106 M⊙
the number of stripped nuclei predicted by the model
is a factor > 20 smaller than the number of observed
GCs+UCDs (∼ 500, while the number inferred from the
GCLF is ∼ 1000). For masses between 106 and 107 M⊙ and
Mnuc/M∗,gal = 0.3 per cent we predict that stripped nu-
clei account for ∼ 2.5 per cent of GCs+UCDs. For masses
larger than 107 M⊙ we predict stripped nuclei account for
∼ 40 per cent of GCs+UCDs and become the dominant for-
mation mechanism for masses larger than ∼ 107.1 M⊙ for a
Kroupa/Chabrier IMF. When assuming Mnuc/M∗,gal = 0.1
per cent the predicted number of stripped nuclei decreases
by a factor ∼2. As the number of dwarf galaxies at the cen-
tre of galaxy clusters is over-predicted by 50 per cent in the
G11 SAM (Weinmann et al. 2011, see also Fig. 7), the num-
ber of predicted stripped nuclei might increase by a factor
of two if more eﬃcient tidal processes were implemented in
the simulations6. However this is still too low to account for
all observed UCDs.

In Fig. 2 we show the cumulative mass function for sim-
ulated stripped nuclei in Fornax-sized galaxy clusters com-
pared with the diﬀerence of the number of spectroscopically
conﬁrmed GCs+UCDs with the GCLF for each SSP model:
i.e. the excess number of objects which cannot be accounted

6 Although the over-abundance of dwarf galaxies might also be
related to the too eﬃcient star formation in low-mass galaxies
at early times or the over-clustering of galaxies at scales below
1 Mpc (Guo et al. 2011). See section 5.2 in P14 for a discussion
about how this aﬀects our predictions.

for by the GCLF. The number of excess GCs+UCDs above
the GCLF is slightly higher within 83 kpc than within 300
kpc which may indicate the number of objects beyond 83
kpc is not complete. Overall, given the uncertainties in our
model, the SSP models and the GCLF, the agreement be-
tween our model and the excess number of GCs+UCDs in
the Fornax cluster is very good. Within 83 kpc the predicted
number of stripped nuclei agree well with the excess number
of GCs+UCDs for all SSP models. Within 300 kpc the pre-
dicted number of stripped nuclei agree well with the number
of GCs+UCDs above the GCLF for the Salpeter IMF. For
the Kroupa and Chabrier IMFs the number of stripped nu-
clei predicted is too large above masses of ∼ 107.3 M⊙. Above
masses of ∼ 108 M⊙ the number of stripped nuclei predicted
may be too large, although the scatter in the simulations is
large at the high-mass end given the small number of objects
and stochastic nature of galaxy mergers.

The good agreement between the predicted number of
stripped nuclei and the excess of GCs+UCDs above the
GCLF implies that the observed number of GCs+UCDs can
be described by a combination of the GCLF and stripped
nuclear clusters. This suggests the most massive ‘genuine
GC’7 has a mass of ∼ 107.3 M⊙. This is in good agreement
with the most massive GC suggested from the NGC1399 GC
luminosity function (Hilker 2009) and that suggested using
a physically-motivated Toomre argument (which is found to
describe very well the mass of young massive cluster popula-
tions, Adamo et al. 2015): Based on the most massive giant
molecular clouds observed at high-redshift (Toomre mass
∼109 M⊙ at z > 2, Genzel et al. 2011), Kruijssen (2014) de-
rived a maximum GC mass at formation of 107.5 M⊙ in high-
redshift environments (in particular for possible progenitors
of massive galaxies like NGC1399). After taking into account
mass-loss due to stellar evolution such an object would have
a present day mass of ∼ 107.3 M⊙, remarkably consistent
with the most massive genuine GC suggested from our anal-
ysis.

Given the low numbers involved, distinguishing between
a scenario where all UCDs are genuine GCs or one where
UCDs are a combination of stripped nuclei and genuine GCs
is nearly impossible by numbers alone. However, a combina-
tion of the Fornax GC luminosity function and the predicted
mass function for stripped nuclei shows good agreement with
the observed mass function of GCs+UCDs in the Fornax
cluster. For masses larger than the completeness limits there
is some evidence the GC+UCD mass function is better ﬁt
by a combination of the GCLF and stripped nucleus mass
function (6.4 and 4.9 per cent agreement within 83 and 300
kpc, respectively, according to a KS test, averaged over all
SSP models) than the GCLF alone (1.6 and 1.7 per cent
agreement within 83 and 300 kpc, respectively, according to
a KS test, averaged over all SSP models).

In Fig. 3 we show the cumulative mass functions of
Virgo cluster UCDs and simulated stripped nuclei in Virgo-
sized galaxy clusters within 288 kpc of the central galaxy
(M87 for the Virgo cluster). It must be kept in mind that
here UCDs are deﬁned as having sizes Re & 10 pc while for
the stripped nuclei a size cut is not possible with our model.

Figure 3. Cumulative mass function of simulated stripped nu-
clei in Virgo-sized galaxy clusters within a projected distance of
288 kpc from the central galaxy (dashed line with the standard
deviation between clusters shown by dash-dotted lines) compared
with UCDs (Re & 10 pc) in the Virgo cluster (thick solid line).
The dashed magenta and solid cyan lines show UCDs masses us-
ing the Maraston (2005) SSP model with a Kroupa IMF for ages
of 13 and 11 Gyr, respectively. The vertical red line shows the
estimated completeness of the UCDs.

Above masses of ∼ 107.3 M⊙ all observed GCs and UCDs
have sizes larger than ∼ 10 pc (e.g. Misgeld & Hilker 2011;
Norris et al. 2014) and therefore reasonable comparisons can
be made above this mass. For Virgo-sized clusters there are
signiﬁcantly more high-mass (M > 107.5 M⊙) stripped nu-
clei predicted than the observed number of UCDs (although
in absolute terms it is only a diﬀerence of 4-5 objects). Above
masses of ∼ 106.6 M⊙ the total predicted number of stripped
nuclei is close to the number of observed UCDs and there-
fore in principle stripped nuclei can account for all observed
objects. However at lower masses there are more observed
objects than predicted by a factor ∼ 2, with the diﬀerence
likely being even larger given the incompleteness. The slope
of the mass function predicted for stripped nuclei also diﬀers
from that of the UCDs: Over the mass range 106.6-107.9 M⊙
stripped nuclei have a power law slope αSN = −0.62 while
Virgo UCDs have a slope αUCDs = −1.4. This may be an
indication that the galaxy disruption criterion is too eﬃ-
cient for high-mass galaxies, our assumption of a constant
nucleus-to-galaxy mass ratio Mnuc/M∗,gal with redshift is in-
accurate, Mnuc/M∗,gal of the most massive nucleated galax-
ies is decreased (some hints of this is shown for galaxies
with M∗,gal ∼ 1011 M⊙ in ﬁg. 6(c) of Georgiev et al. 2016)
or the nucleation fraction of galaxies with M∗,gal ∼ 1011 M⊙
is less than the 80 per cent we assumed. As we do not pre-
dict sizes for the stripped nuclei it is also possible that the
most massive objects would have sizes too large to be con-
sidered UCDs (i.e. Re > 100 pc) and therefore should not
be included in the comparison.

Figure 4. Velocity dispersions σ of simulated stripped nuclei (dashed lines) and dwarf galaxies (long dashed lines) compared with GC
and UCD (triangles, squares and stars) and dwarf galaxy (circles) populations in the Fornax (left panel) and Virgo clusters (right panel)
as a function of projected radius. The lines for the simulation data are averages of all clusters over three sight-lines (along the x-, y-
and z-axes of the simulation) with the standard deviation between individual clusters given by the thin lines (long and short dashes for
dwarfs and stripped nuclei, respectively). All observational data is split into bins of equal numbers, where the point for radius is given
by the mean of all objects within a bin and the extent of all objects within a bin is shown by the horizontal error bars. For the Fornax
cluster GCs+UCDs we show σ for the whole sample (blue triangles), objects with masses M > 5× 106 M⊙ (cyan squares; approximately
complete within 83 kpc) and objects with masses M > 107 M⊙ (magenta stars; approximately complete within 300 kpc). We make the
same mass cuts for stripped nuclei as the observed GCs+UCDs (with the black and grey dashed lines for the Fornax cluster showing
mass limits of M > 5 × 106 M⊙ and M > 107 M⊙, respectively) but only show the standard deviation of the M > 5 × 106 M⊙ limit
for clarity. For the Virgo cluster UCDs (deﬁned as having Re & 10 pc) and stripped nuclei we only use objects with masses larger than
106.6 M⊙ where the observations are approximately complete within 288 kpc. Virgo cluster GCs are from Strader et al. (2011, excluding
any objects deﬁned as UCDs). For the observed populations the standard deviations are determined by √N statistics8.

Throughout this section, to determine M/L ratios for ob-
served GCs and UCDs we use the M05 SSP (rHB) with
a Kroupa IMF and 13 Gyr ages as the diﬀerence between
the 11 and 13 Gyr models is small and the model with
a Kroupa IMF is intermediate between the Chabrier and
Salpeter IMF SSPs. We caution here that since the veloci-
ties of the stripped nuclei are determined by a single parti-
cle in the simulations the velocities could be incorrect com-
pared to that expected for a system of particles. Since we
are calculating velocity dispersions and not comparing the
velocities of individual nuclei we expect this will not aﬀect
our results signiﬁcantly. However the method of determining
which galaxies are disrupted in the SAM may severely aﬀect
our results (e.g. by choosing galaxies with high relative ve-
locities that may not be disrupted in reality) and therefore
caution must be taken when interpreting these results. The
simulations were observed from three sight-lines (the x-, y-
and z-axes of the simulation) and the data from all clusters
were combined for the velocity dispersion measurements to
improve statistics.

In the left panel of Fig. 4 we show the predicted veloc-
ity dispersions for stripped nuclei and dwarf galaxies from
the simulations compared with the velocity dispersions of
the Fornax GC+UCD and dwarf galaxy populations. The
typical deviation in average stripped nuclei velocity disper-

8 Note that √N statistics leads to underestimated errors of the
velocity dispersion if the distribution even slightly deviates from
normality (Beers et al. 1990) and therefore the errors are proba-
bly underestimated.

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18

sion between individual clusters is ∼ 90 km s−1 and the
stripped nuclei show no change of velocity dispersion with
mass. For the dwarf galaxies we take all observed galax-
ies with −19.6 < MB/mag < −13.4, corresponding to
108 < M∗/ M⊙ < 1010.5 in the simulations assuming a mass-
to-light ratio M/LB = 3 (M/L)⊙, giving 25 objects per bin.
The velocity dispersions of the SAM dwarf galaxies are in
good agreement with the observed dwarf galaxies which sug-
gests the cluster virial mass range is accurate. For the For-
nax GCs+UCDs we show the whole sample (117 objects per
bin), objects with masses M > 5 × 106 M⊙ (approximately
complete within 83 kpc; 20 objects per bin) and objects
with masses M > 107 M⊙ (approximately complete within
300 kpc; 10 objects per bin). Due to the low number of ob-
jects per bin for the GCs+UCDs with masses > 5 × 106 M⊙
and > 107 M⊙ the actual uncertainties are probably larger
than shown. There is no signiﬁcant change in the velocity
dispersions of the GCs+UCDs with diﬀerent mass cuts and
is therefore consistent with the whole population originating
from the same distribution. The outermost bins (∼ 150 kpc)
for all GCs+UCDs and M > 5 × 106 M⊙ have low velocity
dispersions relative to the rest of the population. However
the observations are incomplete at this radius and having a
complete sample may increase the velocity dispersion mea-
surement.

Interestingly, for the Fornax cluster the predicted ve-
locity dispersions for stripped nuclei agree very well with
the observed GCs+UCDs. This may be a consequence of
many GCs being accreted from dwarf galaxies by the cen-
tral cluster galaxy, and thus having a similar origin and ve-

locities to stripped nuclei (e.g. Cˆot´e, Marzke & West 1998;
Hilker, Infante & Richtler 1999b). The stripped nuclei have
a velocity dispersion almost constant with radius which
agrees with GCs+UCDs at small distances (less than 100
kpc) and dwarf galaxies at large distances (greater than 200
kpc). As found by Gregg et al. (2009), UCDs and stripped
nuclei have lower velocity dispersions than dwarf galaxies
in the central regions of the Fornax cluster. The diﬀerence
between dwarfs and stripped nuclei implies there is a bias to-
wards galaxies with low relative velocities (compared to the
host galaxy) being disrupted at the centre of galaxy clusters.
Given the ﬁnding of similar velocity dispersions for GCs and
stripped nuclei, velocity dispersions are therefore unable to
distinguish between the formation mechanisms of UCDs in
the Fornax cluster.

In the right panel of Fig. 4 we show the velocity disper-
sions of the Virgo GC (70 objects per bin), UCD (14 objects
per bin) and dwarf galaxy populations (68 objects per bin)
compared with the predictions for stripped nuclei and dwarf
galaxies from the simulations. The Virgo GCs are from the
sample compiled by Strader et al. (2011), have i-band lumi-
nosities between −7.65 and −12.3 mag and are deﬁned as
having sizes . 10 pc. Virgo UCDs are from (Zhang et al.
2015) and are deﬁned as having sizes & 10 pc. Again, due to
the low number of objects per bin, the actual uncertainties
for UCDs are probably much larger than those shown. The
typical deviation in average stripped nuclei velocity disper-
sion between individual clusters is ∼ 130 km s−1. For the
observed dwarf galaxies from the EVCC we include both
certain and possible members. The most distant points for
the dwarfs are therefore probably signiﬁcantly aﬀected by
non-cluster members that account for the rise in velocity
dispersion. The velocity dispersion proﬁle of the simulated
dwarfs is on average slightly lower than the observed dwarfs
but is within the cluster-to-cluster scatter of the simulations.
Zhang et al. (2015) previously compared Virgo cluster GC
and UCD velocity dispersions and found that UCDs have
velocity dispersions more similar to blue GCs than red GCs
and red GCs have an overall lower velocity dispersion than
both blue GCs and UCDs. All three populations have disper-
sions lower than dwarf elliptical galaxies. Since we include
both red and blue GCs the similar velocity dispersions of
UCDs and GCs is due to blue GCs outnumbering red GCs
by a factor of three in the sample.

For the Virgo cluster the predicted velocity dispersions
of stripped nuclei match reasonably well that of the observed
UCDs within 60 kpc. For larger distances the stripped nu-
clei have signiﬁcantly elevated velocity dispersions compared
to the GCs and UCDs and instead trace that of the dwarf
galaxies. This could indicate that despite their sizes most
Virgo UCDs are simply GCs, however more work is needed
on the modelling side before strong conclusions can be made.
The cause of stripped nuclei velocities in Virgo-like clus-
ters (and to a lesser extent, Fornax-like clusters) following
that of the dwarf galaxies at distances larger than ∼100
kpc is the origin of the objects. In Fig. 5 we show the frac-
tion of ‘accreted’ stripped nuclei for Fornax- and Virgo-sized
clusters. Here accreted refers to stripped nuclei that formed
around galaxies other than the central galaxy of the cluster
(which may or may not have then been disrupted itself). At
distances less than 100 kpc most stripped nuclei (> 70 per
cent) form around the central galaxy of the cluster. The ac-

creted fraction then rises sharply and above distances of 200
kpc most stripped nuclei (> 70 per cent) are formed around
satellite galaxies (or galaxies which later become satellites).
This is very similar to the distance where M87 GCs become
contaminated by intra-cluster GCs (∼ 150 kpc, Zhang et al.
2015).

In Fig. 6 we show the orbital anisotropy of stripped nu-
clei for Fornax- and Virgo-sized clusters. Here we include
all stripped nuclei to obtain reliable statistics as anisotropy
is independent of mass in our model. As our model does
not take into account ongoing mass-loss of stripped nu-
clei through tidal stripping which would preferentially re-

move objects at small distances with radially biased or-
bits, at small radii (∼ 10 kpc) the anisotropies measured
for the simulations are probably inaccurate. We ﬁnd the
anisotropy of stripped nuclei is preferentially radially biased
with no dependency on clustercentric distance, having a typ-
ical value of β ∼ 0.5. This agrees well with the anisotropy of
Virgo UCDs determined from Jeans analysis (Zhang et al.
2015) at distances of & 50 kpc. At smaller radii the simula-
tions strongly disagree with observation, where UCDs have
β ∼ −0.5 at 10 kpc, which can be attributed to the lack of
ongoing disruption. Zhang et al. also found blue GCs have
similar anisotropies to UCDs at distances smaller than 40
kpc, but have β < 0 at larger distances. This might indicate
many UCDs at small distances have an origin similar to blue
GCs, with the contribution of stripped nuclei increasing with
distance. However our model does not include possible cir-
cularization of orbits by dynamical friction or the altering
of orbits by major galaxy mergers.

4.3 Radial distributions

In this section we compare the predicted radial distributions
for our model stripped nuclei and dwarf galaxies from the
G11 SAM with observations in the Fornax and Virgo clus-
ters. As in the previous section, we use M05 SSP (rHB) with
a Kroupa IMF and 13 Gyr ages to determine M/L ratios for
the observed GCs and UCDs.

The radial distributions of GCs+UCDs (with masses >
107 M⊙ where observations are complete) and dwarf galaxies
in the Fornax cluster (solid lines) and the predictions from
simulations for stripped nuclei and dwarf galaxies (dashed
lines) are shown in Fig. 7. Here we include galaxies without
radial velocity measurements in the observed dwarf galaxy
sample. The innermost 20 kpc is excluded since dwarf galaxy
and GC+UCD counts are incomplete due to the high surface
brightness of the central galaxy. Assuming an average mass-
to-light ratio M/LB = 3 (M/L)⊙, the luminosity limits for
the observed dwarf galaxies −19.6 < MB/mag < −13.4 ap-
proximately correspond to the mass limits for dwarf galaxies
in the simulation 108 < M∗/ M⊙ < 1010.5. The average ra-
dial distribution of the simulated stripped nuclei is more
extended than that of observed GCs+UCDs, although, due
to the low number of objects, there is large scatter in the
simulations and the normalized distribution agrees with the
observations at the ∼1-σ level. In Fig. 8 we show the radial
distribution of Fornax GCs+UCDs and simulated stripped
nuclei within 83 kpc, where we can be conﬁdent observa-
tions are complete. We don’t include in the plot stripped
nuclei with masses > 107 M⊙ since the predictions are same
as for the > 5 × 106 M⊙ mass cut but with a slightly larger
standard deviation. Interestingly within this radius the ra-
dial distributions of the GCs+UCDs and stripped nuclei all
agree very well and may suggest stripped nuclei formation is
too eﬃcient in our model beyond this distance for the most
massive progenitor galaxies (M∗ & 1010 M⊙).

Both the numbers and shape of the distribution for
dwarf galaxies disagrees strongly between the observa-
tions and simulations in Fig. 7. This is in contrast to
Weinmann et al. (2011) who found the surface number
density proﬁle for Fornax cluster dwarf galaxies is repro-
duced by the G11 SAM. The diﬀerence is due to our
fainter mass/luminosity limit for dwarf galaxies compared

to Weinmann et al.. The simulations predict 40 per cent
more dwarf galaxies than observed and also show a more
concentrated distribution than the observations. The over-
production of dwarf galaxies in clusters in the G11 SAM is
already well known (G11; Weinmann et al. 2011) and might
be due to too eﬃcient star formation in dwarf galaxies, too
strong clustering on small scales or inaccurate modelling
of tidal eﬀects. As discussed in section 5.2 of P14, the too
strong clustering of galaxies at small scales does not aﬀect
our predictions since the fraction of mass in a halo that was
accreted in subhaloes of a given mass is relatively insensi-
tive to the shape of the power spectrum (Zentner & Bullock
2003; Dooley et al. 2014). Whether a change in the eﬃciency
of star formation will aﬀect our predictions is unclear as
changes to a parameter in the SAM may be oﬀset by other
factors, although it is unlikely to aﬀect radial distributions.
Since tidal eﬀects are strongest in the cluster centre, more
accurate modelling of tidal eﬀects may decrease dwarf galaxy
numbers and create a more extended radial distribution,
thereby increasing the number of stripped nuclei.

In Fig 9 we show the predicted radial distributions of
stripped nuclei and dwarf galaxies in Virgo-sized clusters
compared with blue and red GCs, UCDs and dwarf galax-
ies in the Virgo cluster. The observed dwarf galaxy sam-
ple is from VCC (Binggeli et al. 1985, excluding probable
background galaxies) and includes all galaxies with masses
108 < M∗/ M⊙ < 1010.5 (assuming M/LB = 3 (M/L)⊙). As
for the Fornax cluster the number of dwarf galaxies is over-
predicted in the SAM and the radial distribution is too con-
centrated compared to the observations. The radial distribu-
tion of Virgo GCs was determined from the S´ersic proﬁle ﬁts
to the red and blue GCs (Zhang et al. 2015). Zhang et al.
(2015) previously compared the surface number density pro-
ﬁles of red and blue GCs with UCDs. They found UCDs
follow the red GCs at distances larger than 70 kpc (which
can also be seen in Fig. 9) and have a proﬁle shallower than
both red and blue GCs at smaller distances.

We ﬁnd the stripped nuclei have a radial distribution
that is signiﬁcantly more extended than the UCDs and red
GCs but is only slightly more extended than the blue GCs.

Figure 9. Absolute (left) and normalized (right) projected radial distributions of blue and red GCs (blue thin solid and red dash-dotted
lines), UCDs (solid magenta line) and dwarf galaxies in the Virgo cluster (from VCC; dotted green line) within 288 kpc (within which the
UCDs are approximately complete) compared with the predictions of stripped nuclei and dwarf galaxies from simulations (black dashed
and green long-dashed lines with standard deviation shown by dotted lines). For the Virgo cluster UCDs and stripped nuclei we only use
objects with masses larger than 106.6 M⊙ where the observations are approximately complete. Each simulated cluster is observed from
three directions (x-, y- and z-axes of simulation) and the average radial distribution is used. The innermost 20 kpc is excluded since
dwarf galaxy and GC+UCD counts are incomplete due to the high surface brightness of the central galaxy.

This may suggest a common origin of stripped nuclei and
blue GCs. However if more eﬃcient disruption of galaxies
at the cluster centre (∼100 kpc) was implemented in the
G11 SAM to improve dwarf galaxy numbers, stripped nuclei
numbers would increase and the radial distribution would
become more centrally concentrated.

4.4 Metallicities

In order to compare the predicted metallicities for stripped
nuclei with the observed metallicities of UCDs we must
assign metallicities to the stripped nuclei. We ﬁrst de-
termine log(Z/Z⊙) of the progenitor galaxies from the
G11 SAM. We then convert to [Fe/H] using the relation
[Z/H] = [Fe/H] + 0.94[α/Fe] (Thomas, Maraston, & Bender

2003) and assuming [Z/H] = log(Z/Z⊙). We assume that
[α/Fe] = 0.3 which is typical of GCs, UCDs, bulges and (gi-
ant) ellipticals (e.g. Pritzl et al. 2005; Francis et al. 2012;
Kuntschner et al. 2010). Nuclear clusters typically have
[α/Fe] ∼ 0 (Paudel et al. 2011), although there is large scat-
ter with some clusters having [α/Fe] ∼ 0.5. However nuclear
clusters that can be observed are objects that have survived
until the present day with potentially extended star forma-
tion histories and therefore may have diﬀerent properties to
nuclear clusters at high redshift. Thus it is plausible that at
high redshift (where most stripped nuclei are formed, P14),
nuclear clusters have elevated α-abundance ratios due to
formation in starbursts or GC infall by dynamical friction.
Finally, we assign the nucleus of each galaxy the metallic-
ity of their host galaxy with an oﬀset of 0.067 dex given

Figure 10. Predicted metallicities of stripped nuclei in Fornax- and Virgo-sized galaxy clusters (grey points) compared with nuclear
clusters from Paudel et al. (2011, left panel) and GCs and UCDs from nearby galaxies and galaxy clusters (right panel) from Mieske et al.
(2008), Chilingarian et al. (2011) and Francis et al. (2012). The mean and conﬁdence interval for the simulated stripped nuclei are given
by the solid and dashed lines, respectively, using bin sizes of 100 objects.

nuclei are typically slightly more metal rich than their host
galaxies and for each nucleus add a random oﬀset drawn
from a Gaussian of a width 0.46 dex to account for the typ-
ical scatter between the metallicity of nuclei and their host
galaxies (Paudel et al. 2011). In the left panel of Fig. 10 we
show the metallicities predicted for the stripped nuclei com-
pared with the nuclear clusters from Paudel et al. (2011). To
convert to stellar masses, SDSS r-band M/L ratios for the
nuclear clusters were determined from their ages and metal-
licities with the closest ﬁt M05 models (Kroupa IMF, red
horizontal branch) from their SSP grid in age and metallic-
ity. The metallicities we predict for the stripped nuclei are in
reasonable agreement with the nuclear cluster metallicities,
although within the same mass range the nuclear clusters
are 0.2 dex more metal rich on average.

We show the predicted metallicities for stripped nuclei
compared to the metallicities of GCs and UCDs (see Section
3.3) in the right panel of Fig. 10. Where possible we use the
dynamical masses measured for objects in this sample. For
masses & 5 × 106 M⊙ there is good agreement between the
metallicities predicted for stripped nuclei and those of the
observed GCs+UCDs, although the stripped nuclei reach
larger metallicities. Below masses of 106 M⊙ the stripped nu-
clei are predicted to be 0.5 dex more metal rich on average
than the observed GCs. This is expected because many blue
(i.e. metal-poor) genuine GCs mix into the sample for masses
below 107 M⊙ due to the mass-metallicity relation (the blue
tilt) for masses above 2 × 106 M⊙ (e.g. Norris & Kannappan
2011). However if nuclear clusters are mostly formed from
infall of (primarily metal-poor) star clusters via dynamical
friction in low-mass galaxies and star formation following
gas accretion in high-mass galaxies (e.g. Turner et al. 2012)
the metallicity oﬀset between nuclear clusters and their host
galaxies may change with galaxy mass, causing stripped nu-
clei from low-mass galaxies to be more metal-poor.

To compare in more detail the predictions for metal-
licities of stripped nuclei with those observed for GCs and
UCDs, in Fig. 11 we show the normalized histogram of GCs
and UCDs and simulated stripped nuclei with masses be-

licity assignments for the stripped nuclei to account for the
randomly chosen metallicity oﬀsets between galaxies and nu-
clear clusters. We ﬁnd reasonable agreement between the
predictions and the observations given we have not tried to
mimic the fraction of objects coming from diﬀerent galaxy
clusters. The four outermost bins of the simulation his-
togram objects show some deviation from the observed ob-
jects. However, due to the low number of stripped nuclei in
each simulated galaxy cluster, the standard deviation for in-
dividual clusters is much larger than the standard deviation
of the mean for all galaxy clusters and may account for this

diﬀerence. According to a KS test, the observed GCs and
UCDs show a 25 per cent probability of being drawn from
the same distribution as the stripped nuclei (the average in
log-space of 100 repeated calculations, with a standard devi-
ation of 0.5 dex). This shows that many of the most massive
UCDs could have formed from the tidal stripping of nucle-
ated galaxies. However, given the trend in [Fe/H] with mass
for the observed GCs and UCDs (below masses of 107 M⊙
where we ﬁnd stripped nuclei contribute little to the popula-
tion, Section 4.1), the possibility of the most massive objects
being the high-mass end of the GC population is also not
ruled out by metallicity.

4.5 Central black holes

UCDs are known to have dynamical mass-to-light ratios
above what is expected from their stellar populations
(Ha¸segan et al. 2005; Mieske et al. 2008, 2013). One sugges-
tion is that these elevated mass-to-light ratios are caused
by UCDs harbouring central intermediate mass black holes
(IMBH) or SMBHs (Mieske et al. 2013). The ﬁnding of the
ﬁrst UCD to contain a SMBH (M60-UCD1, Seth et al. 2014)
gives plausibility to the possibility that many UCDs may
host black holes (although interestingly the dynamical mass
of M60-UCD1 is consistent with the stellar mass predicted
from population synthesis models, Strader et al. 2013).

In the left panel of Fig. 12 we show the predicted masses
of central black holes for stripped nuclei progenitor galaxies
in the G11 SAM. In the right panel we show the predicted
masses of central black holes in stripped nuclei, where the
black hole masses are taken from the progenitor galaxies of
the stripped nuclei in the SAM. According to the model,
the fraction of stripped nuclei with a central black hole is 97
per cent. For Fornax-like clusters we predict that stripped
nuclei host 13 ± 5 black holes more massive than 106 M⊙
and 3 ± 2 black holes more massive than 107 M⊙. For Virgo-
like clusters we predict that stripped nuclei host 59 ±6 black
holes more massive than 106 M⊙ and 14±2 black holes more
massive than 107 M⊙. In the model, black holes form during
gas-rich mergers and thereafter grow either by the merger of
black holes or the accretion of cold or hot gas (‘quasar’ and
‘radio’ mode, respectively). At low galaxy masses the black
hole masses are dependent on the simulation resolution and
the method in which black holes are ﬁrst seeded. Black hole
masses in galaxies with stellar masses less than ∼ 109 M⊙
(and thus stripped nuclei masses less than ∼ 106.5 M⊙) can
therefore be considered very uncertain.

In Fig. 12 we also show M60-UCD1 (the ﬁrst UCD
to have a conﬁrmed central black hole, Seth et al. 2014),
the implied black hole masses of UCDs assuming their el-
evated dynamical mass-to-light ratios are due to central
black holes (Mieske et al. 2013) and the limits for central
black holes in the GCs ω Cen and G1 (L¨utzgendorf et al.
2013; both of which are thought to be stripped nuclei, e.g.
Hilker & Richtler 2000, Meylan et al. 2001). The black hole
mass of M60-UCD1 agrees well with the predictions for
stripped nuclei and progenitor galaxies, falling within the
1σ conﬁdence intervals. There is also remarkable agreement
between the simulations and the inferred black hole masses
of UCDs from Mieske et al. (2013). For UCDs with an im-
plied black hole mass above zero, 74 per cent (23/31) of the
data points fall within the 1σ conﬁdence interval of the sim-

ulation predictions. For UCDs with a lower black hole mass
limit above zero, 79 per cent (15/19) of the data points fall
within the 1σ conﬁdence interval of the simulation predic-
tions. The GCs ω Cen and G1 both have black hole limits
well below the mean predicted for their mass by the model,
but are within the overall scatter of the simulated objects.

5 DISCUSSION

5.1 The origin of UCDs

Two main scenarios have been suggested for the forma-
tion of UCDs: they are the high-mass end of the GC mass
function observed around galaxies with rich GC systems
(Mieske et al. 2002, 2012) or the nuclei of tidally stripped
dwarf galaxies (Bekki et al. 2001, 2003; Drinkwater et al.
2003; Pfeﬀer & Baumgardt 2013). Although the internal
properties (e.g. metallicities) of simulated UCDs formed by
tidal stripping generally agree well with that of observed
UCDs, we ﬁnd tidal stripping cannot be the dominant for-
mation mechanism of UCDs. Instead we suggest most UCDs
are simply the high-mass end of the GC mass function with
the contribution of UCDs formed by tidal stripping increas-
ing towards higher masses. Above masses of 107.3 M⊙, UCDs
are consistent with being entirely formed by tidal stripping.
In fact for the Virgo cluster more stripped nuclei are pre-
dicted than observed UCDs by a factor of 1.5 above this
mass.

It has been suggested that size and not mass diﬀer-
entiates between UCDs and GCs (e.g. Zhang et al. 2015).
However we ﬁnd that stripped nuclei cannot account for all
Virgo cluster UCDs (which are deﬁned to have sizes & 10
pc). N -body simulations of the formation of stripped nuclei
also show that for pericentre distances . 5 kpc (depend-
ing on the progenitor galaxy properties) the stripped nuclei
formed will have sizes < 10 pc (Pfeﬀer & Baumgardt 2013).
Thus even for sizes above 10 pc GCs must make a signiﬁcant
contribution and size alone does not discriminate between
diﬀerent formation channels.

These ﬁndings are consistent with the ﬁndings of other
recent studies. Mieske et al. (2012) calculated the fraction
of GCs that contribute to the UCD population based on
the speciﬁc frequencies of GCs around galaxies and found
less than 50 per cent of UCDs can have formed by tidal
stripping. Mieske et al. (2013) investigated the dynamical-
to-stellar mass ratios Ψ = Mdyn/M∗ of UCDs and found evi-
dence for a bimodal distribution, with one population having
Ψ < 1 similar to GCs and the other having Ψ > 1 (see their
ﬁgures 2 and 3). In the Fornax cluster less than 10 per cent
(17/∼200) of GCs+UCDs with masses > 2 × 106 M⊙ have
measured dynamical mass-to-light ratios. Of these objects, 9
have Ψ < 1 and are thus consistent with being genuine GCs,
while 5 have Ψ > 1 at the 1σ level and require some addi-
tional dark mass. The remaining 3 might be either genuine
GCs or UCDs formed by tidal stripping that do not host
central black holes (the occupation fraction of supermassive
black holes in UCD progenitor galaxies is likely not 100 per
cent). In fact the only Fornax UCD with spatially resolved
kinematics (UCD3, Frank et al. 2011) has a dynamical mass
consistent with the mass predicted from stellar population
modelling (Mieske et al. 2013). As we ﬁnd about 20 UCDs

maximum progenitor galaxy stellar mass and the right panel compares against stripped nucleus mass. The mean and 1σ conﬁdence
interval for the simulations are given by the solid and dashed lines, respectively, using bin sizes of 100 objects. The typical 1σ conﬁdence
interval in MBH is 0.5 dex. For comparison, in the left panel we show the black hole mass of M60-UCD1 against the estimated progenitor
bulge mass (Seth et al. 2014) and in the right panel we show the black hole mass of M60-UCD1 (Seth et al. 2014), the inferred black hole
masses of UCDs assuming elevated mass-to-light ratios are due to central black holes (Mieske et al. 2013) and the limits for central black
holes in the GCs ω Cen and G1 (L¨utzgendorf et al. 2013). For the observed UCDs and GCs, objects with implied black hole masses of
zero are given by triangles at the bottom of the ﬁgure.

more massive than 2 × 106 M⊙ will have formed by tidal
stripping in the Fornax cluster within 300 kpc (Fig. 2), we
expect most of the GC+UCD population without measured
dynamical mass-to-light ratios should not have an elevated
Ψ if this scenario is correct. Therefore a combination of gen-
uine GCs (where the most massive GCs may have formed
in starbursts in the early universe similar to young massive
clusters, e.g. Renaud et al. 2015) and stripped nuclear clus-
ters is currently suﬃcient to explain the properties of all
observed UCDs in the Fornax cluster.

If UCDs that formed by tidal stripping of nucleated
galaxies host central black holes, they may make a signiﬁ-
cant contribution to the number of SMBHs in galaxy clus-
ters. Seth et al. (2014) found there are 45 galaxies in Fornax
with stellar masses above 3 × 109 M⊙ (where SMBH occu-
pation fraction is high) that are likely to host SMBHs. We
predict for Fornax-like clusters that 14 ± 4 stripped nuclei
with progenitor galaxy stellar masses larger than 3 ×109 M⊙
may host central black holes. This would increase the num-
ber of black holes in the Fornax cluster by ∼ 30 per cent.
For Virgo-like clusters we predict 60 ± 2 stripped nuclei with
progenitor galaxy stellar masses larger than 3 × 109 M⊙ may
host central black holes.

The combination of velocity dispersions (σ), anisotropy
(β) and radial distributions also points to many UCDs sim-
ply being GCs. However we ﬁnd conﬂicting results as to
whether the contribution of stripped nuclei should be largest
at the centre of the cluster or at increasing radii. Zhang et al.
(2015) found Virgo UCDs have β ∼ −0.5 at < 10 kpc,
increasing to 0.5 at > 100 kpc, and an anisotropy proﬁle
similar to blue GCs < 40 kpc. In contrast to the UCDs,
at radii larger than 40 kpc blue GCs have a tangentially
biased anisotropy proﬁle. We predict stripped nuclei have
β ∼ 0.5 at all radii (Fig. 6). This points to stripped nuclei
contributing more with increasing radius. However eﬀects

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18

not included in our model (circularization of orbits by dy-
namical friction, continuous tidal stripping removing objects
on very radial orbits or major galaxy mergers altering the
orbits of the innermost objects) might account for the tan-
gentially biased orbits at the cluster centre. On the other
hand, stripped nuclei match the UCD velocity dispersions
at the centre of clusters but not at distances larger than 50-
100 kpc where σ increases to match that of dwarf galaxies
(Fig. 4), which points to stripped nuclei contributing more
at the cluster centre. Similar to the velocity dispersions, the
predicted stripped nuclei radial distributions match UCDs
within ∼100 kpc but not at larger radii. This may be re-
lated to the overabundance of dwarf galaxies predicted by
the G11 SAM at cluster centres (Fig. 7 and 9) and if more re-
alistic galaxy disruption was implemented may increase the
number of stripped nuclei at the cluster centre and create
a more concentrated radial distribution. For the observed
Virgo UCDs, the radially biased anisotropy and low veloc-
ity dispersion at distances of 100-200 kpc implies the num-
ber density distribution has to drop very strongly beyond
these distances. This is in disagreement with the predic-
tion for stripped nuclei where velocity dispersions increase
at distances & 100 kpc due to the increasing contribution
of stripped nuclei formed around satellite galaxies and for
which there is no strong drop in number density.

The predicted velocity dispersions of stripped nuclei
also has important implications for the origin of blue GCs
in galaxy clusters. Blue GCs that were accreted from dwarf
galaxies should have similar velocity dispersions and orbital
anisotropy to stripped nuclei, i.e. σ that follows dwarf galax-
ies at distances larger than 100 kpc and β ∼ 0.5. The blue
GCs around M87 have σ ∼ 450 km s−1 at 200 kpc and
a tangentially biased anisotropy (Zhang et al. 2015) which
suggests a signiﬁcant fraction of blue GCs could not have
been accreted from dwarf galaxies around M87. Unless their

16

orbits were signiﬁcantly changed after accretion, this would
imply most blue GCs were either formed in situ in the halo
of M87 or possibly accreted during major mergers.

It is not clear how to reconcile the conﬂicting results
for velocity dispersions and anisotropies with the current
data. However it might imply the UCD populations are dom-
inated by GCs and that we are not comparing objects with
similar formation histories. The predicted mass function for
stripped nuclei suggests the most massive UCDs have the
best chance of being ‘genuine UCDs’ (i.e. the nuclear star
clusters of tidally stripped galaxies). However the number
of such objects is not large enough to make statistically sig-
niﬁcant comparisons. Distinguishing between the formation
mechanisms of individual UCDs may therefore only be pos-
sible through the presence of central black holes (Seth et al.
2014), recent star formation (Norris & Kannappan 2011;
Norris et al. 2015) or extended, massive tidal features of
their disrupting progenitor galaxy (Amorisco et al. 2015;
Mihos et al. 2015; Voggel et al. 2015).

5.2 Future work

More work is needed on both the observation and simula-
tion sides to further constrain the stripped nuclei scenario
(and indeed the formation of UCDs generally). In nearby
galaxy clusters, complete, spectroscopically conﬁrmed sam-
ples of GCs and UCDs to larger clustercentric radii would
enable better comparisons. Studies of diﬀerent galaxy clus-
ters have used diﬀerent criteria to diﬀerentiate between GCs
and UCDs; interpreting these results is diﬃcult as diﬀerent
methods may obtain diﬀerent results within the same clus-
ter. Future work should investigate each galaxy cluster using
consistent methods to enable comparison between clusters.
Comparisons between observed and model UCD populations
should be extended beyond the central galaxy of a galaxy
cluster. Programs like the NGVS (Ferrarese et al. 2012;
Zhang et al. 2015) combined with further spectroscopic sur-
veys will enable a systematic comparison over the main sub-
clusters of a galaxy cluster. Observational constraints on the
SMBH occupation fraction in nucleated dwarf galaxies can
be used to determine what fraction of stripped nuclei (and
thus UCDs) should have elevated dynamical mass-to-light
ratios due to the presence of central black holes and, together
with more observations of UCD dynamical mass-to-light ra-
tios, determine if central black holes alone are suﬃcient to
explain UCDs with elevated mass-to-light ratios.

On the simulation side a number of further reﬁnements
of our model are needed. Too many high-mass stripped nu-
clei are predicted for the Virgo cluster (this may also be the
case for the Fornax cluster, however the number of objects
is very small). A number of possible explanations exist for
this diﬀerence:

(i) The galaxy disruption criterion in the SAM is unreal-
istic. According to the SAM, galaxies are disrupted when the
density of a satellite galaxy within its half-mass radius is less
than the host halo density at pericentre. This might over-
estimate the disruption of the highest mass stripped nuclei
progenitor galaxies (M∗ ∼ 1010.5-1011 M⊙) since such ob-
jects would need to lose more than 99 per cent of their mass
to become UCDs.

(ii) Related to the previous point, the high-mass stripped

nuclei might not be observed as UCDs but instead as com-
pact ellipticals. If disruption of the progenitor galaxy is in-
complete (which is especially important for the highest mass
progenitor galaxies that may require extremely small peri-
centre passages to completely remove the galaxy) the result-
ing object may have a size larger than 100 pc and should be
considered a compact elliptical rather than a UCD.

(iii) Our assumption that nuclei have a constant fraction

of galaxy mass at all redshifts may not be realistic.

Future stripped nucleus formation models should include
more realistic models for galaxy disruption, circularization
of orbits by dynamical friction, continuous tidal stripping of
the stripped nuclei and the eﬀect of major galaxy mergers
on stripped nuclei orbits. As the build up of nuclear clusters
with redshift is not possible to observe, models of nucleus
formation are needed to include physically motivated nu-
clear cluster formation. Size predictions are also needed to
allow for better comparisons, in particular with Virgo clus-
ter UCDs, and to determine if the most massive stripped
nuclei predicted should be included in comparisons against
UCDs. These changes may aﬀect the predictions for mass
function, velocity dispersions and radial distributions.

6 SUMMARY

In this paper we compared in detail the predictions of
the semi-analytic model for stripped nucleus formation pre-
sented in P14 with the observed properties of UCDs in the
local universe. Our main ﬁndings are as follows.

(i) The number of stripped nuclei predicted at the high-
mass end of the mass function in Fornax-like clusters is con-
sistent with the most massive objects observed. For masses
larger than 107 M⊙ we predict stripped nuclei account for
∼40 per cent of GCs+UCDs and for masses between 106
and 107 M⊙ account for ∼2.5 per cent of GCs+UCDs. For
the Virgo cluster more high-mass stripped nuclei are pre-
dicted than the number of observed UCDs above masses
∼107.4 M⊙. Below masses of ∼106.7 M⊙ more Virgo UCDs
(deﬁned as having Re & 10 pc) are observed than the pre-
dicted number of stripped nuclei.

(ii) The excess number of Fornax GCs+UCDs above the
GC luminosity function agrees very well with the predicted
number of stripped nuclei. Therefore the GC+UCD mass
function is consistent with being a combination of stripped
nuclei and genuine GCs (formed through the same process
as the majority of GCs). This suggests the most massive
genuine GC in the Fornax cluster has a mass of ∼107.3 M⊙.
(iii) The predicted velocity dispersions for stripped nu-
clei in Fornax-sized clusters agrees well with the observed
GC+UCD population at projected distances less than 100
kpc. For the Virgo cluster the velocity dispersions of stripped
nuclei agree reasonably well with GCs and UCDs at dis-
tances less than ∼50 kpc. At larger distances the velocity
dispersions of stripped nuclei increase to that of the dwarf
galaxies due to the increasing contribution of stripped nuclei
accreted satellite galaxies. For both the Fornax and Virgo
clusters the velocity dispersions of dwarf galaxies in the G11
SAM agree well with observed dwarf galaxies.

(iv) Stripped nuclei are predicted to have radially biased
anisotropies that are approximately constant with radius

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–18

(β ∼ 0.5). This agrees with Virgo UCDs at distances larger
than 100 kpc but disagrees at smaller distances where UCDs
have β decreasing to −0.5 at distances less than 10 kpc
(Zhang et al. 2015). However, ongoing disruption is not in-
cluded in our model which would cause orbits to become
tangentially biased at small radii.

(v) For Fornax-sized clusters the radial distribution of
stripped nuclei agrees well with observed GCs+UCDs within
83 kpc for masses >5 × 106 M⊙. Within 300 kpc and for
masses >107 M⊙ stripped nuclei are on average more ex-
tended than observed GCs+UCDs, but consistent due to
the large scatter for the simulations. For Virgo-sized clus-
ters the radial distribution of stripped nuclei is signiﬁcantly
more extended than that of UCDs.

(vi) For masses between 107 and 108 M⊙, the predicted
metallicities of stripped nuclei agree well with the observed
metallicities of GCs and UCDs. Below masses of 106 M⊙,
stripped nuclei are predicted to be ∼0.5 dex more metal-
rich on average than observed GCs and UCDs. This may be
due to a metallicity oﬀset between nuclear clusters and host
galaxies that scales with galaxy mass.

(vii) The predicted central black hole masses for stripped
nuclei agree well with the observed black hole mass of M60-
UCD1 and the black hole masses implied for UCDs assuming
their elevated mass-to-light ratios are due to central black
holes. However, assuming Milky Way GCs with possible
central black holes formed as stripped nuclei, the predic-
tions from the modelling are 10-100 time higher than the
observed values, suggesting the modelling is inaccurate at
these masses or that MW GCs with IMBH estimates are
not stripped nuclei. UCD black hole masses may therefore
provide another approach to test SMBH formation scenar-
ios.

These ﬁndings together suggest that, although not the
dominant mechanism of UCD formation, a signiﬁcant frac-
tion of the highest mass UCDs (M > 107 M⊙) were formed
by tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies.
