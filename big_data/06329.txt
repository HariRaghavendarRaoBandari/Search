LIANGMING SHEN

Abstract. We prove that on one K¨ahler-Einstein Fano manifold without holomorphic
vector ﬁelds, there exists a unique conical K¨ahler-Einstein metric along a simple normal
crossing divisor with admissible prescribed cone angles. We also establish a curvature
estimate for conic metrics along a simple normal crossing divisor which generalizes Li-
Rubinstein’s estimate and derive high order estimates from this estimate.

1. Introduction

Conic K¨ahler metrics are very useful in the study of K¨ahler geometry. Recently there
are a lot of works on this topic [1] [4] [5] [15] [16] [17] [18] [20] [23] [24] [30] [36] [38] [39].
It played a crucial role in the solution to Yau-Tian-Donaldson Conjecture [35] [7] [8] [9]
on Fano manifolds. In this solution one important part is the analysis of the continuity
path of the cone angle, which has been studied in [15]. The idea is to investigate the
behavior of the solutions to conical K¨ahler-Einstein metrics as the angle tends to 1. Then
the stability condition guarantees that the solution could be extended, which generates
a smooth K¨ahler-Einstein metric. On the other hand, we can consider the existence of
conical K¨ahler-Einstein metrics assuming the existence of smooth K¨ahler-Einstein metrics,
which could be studied along the continuity path of decreasing cone angles. Related works
in this direction could be found in [20] [30] [38] in case of one smooth divisor. In [30], Song-
Wang also considered the case of simple normal crossing divisors on toric Fano manifolds.
In this paper, we consider the general situation of simple normal crossing divisors and our
main result is as below, which could be thought as the generalization of Theorem 1.1 of
[20]:

Theorem 1.1. Given a Fano manifold (M, ω0) without holomorphic vector ﬁelds where
[ω0] = c1(M), which admits a K¨ahler-Einstein metric ωKE satisfying Ric(ωKE) = ωKE.

in case that cr = 1, then for µ, β1,· · · , βm ∈ (0, 1) which satisfy

(1.2)
there exists a unique C 2,α,B conical K¨ahler-Einstein metric in c1(M) with cone angle 2πβr
along each irreducible divisor Dr for r = 1,· · · , m for some α ∈ (0, 1) depending on
B := (β1,· · · , βm).

The study of such metrics is related to klt singularities in algebraic geometry. However
in this general setting even the linear theory developed in [15] [18] is unclear to hold so
the continuity method and a prior C 0-estimate in [18] for smooth divisor case cannot
be adapted directly. Alternately, we will make use the approximation method developed
in [35] [24] [38], to construct smooth solutions to the complex Monge-Ampere equations
which approximate the conical Monge-Ampere equation associated to the conical K¨ahler-
Einstein metric along a simple normal crossing divisor. To obtain the solutions, we need
to derive the properness of perturbed energy functionals, e.g., Ding energy or Mabuchi
energy from the existence of smooth K¨ahler-Einstein metric. We also need to establish
a uniform C 0-estimate for the approximating solutions and then deduce a unique weak
solution to conical Monge-Ampere equation by Berndtsson’s uniqueness theorem [3].

However, the approximation method can only guarantee the existence of weak solution
to conical Monge-Ampere equation. To establish the regularity of the solution we ﬁrst
need to establish the Laplacian estimate of the solution. In case of one irreducible divisor
[18] this estimate comes from an application of Chern-Lu’s Inequality [22] which requires
a bisectional upper bound estimate of the background conic metric by Li-Rubinstein
(see the appendix of [18] or C. Li’s thesis [19]).
In simple normal crossing case the
curvature estimate is much more complicated. In [5] [16] they construct an approximating
sequence of background conic metric. As their metrics do not have a uniformly curvature
bound from any side they need more complicated calculations to derive the Laplacian
estimate. Alternately in [12] Datar-Song gave a simple Laplacian estimate depending on
Li-Rubinstein’s curvature estimate. In this paper, we generalize Li-Rubinstein’s curvature
estimate to simple normal crossing case:

Theorem 1.2. For a K¨ahler manifold M with a simple normal crossing divisor consisting
of m irreducible divisors Dr, r = 1,· · · , m on M, suppose we have a conic metric

m

with cone angle 2πβr along each irreducible divisor Dr. Then we have two cases:
(1)for either all cone angles βr ≤ 1
2 or D is composed by irreducible divisors free of triple
singularities, the bisectional curvature of ω is uniformly bounded from above on M \ D.
(2)for D containing higher multiple singularities, there exists a smooth potential function
ϕ0 such that ω + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕ0 is a conic K¨ahler metric which is equivalent to ω and its
bisectional curvature is uniformly bounded from above on M \ D.
Remark 1.3. By Y. Rubinstein and the author’s computation, until now we can only
obtain the upper bisectional curvature bound for the case that either all cone angles βi ≤ 1
2
or D is composed by irreducible divisors free of triple singularity, which is just the ﬁrst
part of 1.2. The problem for higher multiple singularities is that near such singularities,
the diagonal terms of the background metric ω0 cannot supply enough control over its non-
diagonal terms. However, if we add a smooth function ϕ0 to enlarge the diagonal terms
then such control can be achieved. In this sense the two conclusions could be combined as
we can set ϕ0 = 0 in the ﬁrst case. Although this setting changes the original background
metric, as the modiﬁed metric is still equivalent to the original one, the Laplacian estimate
can still be established by Chern-Lu’s Inequality.

Finally, the C 2,α,B-estimate could be derived by Tian’s beautiful estimate in [36]. The
simple normal crossing case could also be derived by some generalization and the readers
can see [26] which established a parabolic estimate but the elliptic version can be derived
similarly and even more easily.

2. Basic setting, energy functionals and log alpha-invariants

As [35], ﬁrst we need to derive a complex Monge-Ampere equation from the equation
(6.1) and conical K¨ahler-Einstein condition. We know that a simple normal crossing

m

divisor D =
Dr is consisting of m irreducible divisors which can be written as Dr =
{zr = 0} locally. Denote Sr as the deﬁning holomorphic section of Dr and || · ||r as the
Hermitian metric deﬁned on the holomorphic line bundle [Dr]. By (6.1) (1.2) we have that

Pr=1

(1 − βr)R(|| · ||r) = (1 − µ)(ω0 + √−1∂ ¯∂h),

(2.1)

m

Xr=1

4

where R(|| · ||r) is the curvature of || · ||r and h is a smooth function. Suppose ωc =
ω0 + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕ is the required conical K¨ahler-Einstein metric, then by equations above it
satisﬁes

m

Ric(ωc) = µωc +

2π(1 − βr)[Dr]

(2.2)

If the background metric ω0 satisﬁes

Ric(ω0) = ω0 + √−1∂ ¯∂h0,

we could derive a conical Monge-Ampere equation for ϕ :

where h is a smooth function satisﬁes RM (eh − 1)ωn
(ω0 + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕ)n = eh0−(1−µ)h−µϕ−Pm

where aµ is a constant satisfying

0 = 0, then by these equations above

0 ,

(2.3)

ZM

(eh0−(1−µ)h−Pm

r=1(1−βr) log ||Sr||2+aµ − 1)ωn

0 = 0.

Note that in [18] [20] they applied continuity method to solve such conical Monge-Ampere
equation. Actually their works highly rely on the linear theory with respect to the stan-
dard conic metric along one smooth divisor. For simple normal crossing divisors such
linear theory is not known yet. Alternately, we try to establish the existence of the so-
lution by approximating method in [35] [24] [38]. Basically, we can perturb the equation
(2.3) to the following smooth equation:

(ω0 + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕǫ)n = eh0−(1−µ)h−µϕǫ−Pm

r=1(1−βr) log(||Sr||2+ǫ)+aµ,ǫωn
0 ,

(2.4)

where aµ,ǫ is a constant satisfying

ZM

(eh0−(1−µ)h−Pm

r=1(1−βr) log(||Sr||2+ǫ)+aµ,ǫ − 1)ωn

0 = 0.

Our strategy is to solve this approximating equation and try to obtain the compactness
of the approximating solutions. To achieve this goal, as [33] [35] we will introduce cor-
responding energy functionals, analyze the properness, and ﬁnally establish the uniform
C 0-estimate.

Recall in [10] [11] [33], we have the following energy functionals for ϕ ∈ P SH(M, ω0):

There are some nice properties of those functionals, see [34] for more details. Then we
can introduce the twisted Ding functional and the twisted Mabuchi functional (see [18]
[20] [24]), which are the Lagrangians of the conical Monge-Ampere equation (2.3). For
simplicity here we set

In [33], Tian pointed out that the C 0-estimate for the K¨ahler-Einstein problem could
be established if the Ding functional or the Mabuchi functional is proper. Similarly, to
establish the uniform C 0-estimates for the approximating equation (2.4), we need to check
the properness of the corresponding Ding functionals or Mabuchi functionals, which could
be derived from the properness of corresponding twisted functionals. First, we recall the
deﬁnition of the properness:

Deﬁnition 2.3. Suppose the twisted Ding functional Fω0,µ(ϕ)(twisted Mabuchi functional
νω0,µ(ϕ)) is bounded from below, i.e. Fω0,µ(ϕ) ≥ −cω0 (νω0,µ(ϕ) ≥ −cω0), we say it
is proper on P SH(M, ω0), if there exists an increasing function f : [−cω0,∞)→R, and
limt→∞ f (t) = ∞, such that for any ϕ ∈ P SH(M, ω0), we have

Fω0,µ(ϕ) ≥ f (Jω0(ϕ))

(νω,µ(ϕ) ≥ f (Jω0(ϕ))).

There are a lot of properties of these functionals, for more details, see [34] [20]. The
main result of this section is the properness of the twisted Ding functional assuming the
conditions in Theorem 1.1:

6

LIANGMING SHEN

Theorem 2.4. Assume the conditions of Theorem 1.1, then Fω0,µ(ϕ) is proper with respect
to Jω0(ϕ), more precisely, there exists an η > 0 and a constant Cη such that

Fω0,µ(ϕ) ≥ ηJω0(ϕ) − Cη.

(2.6)

To prove this theorem, we will adapt the interpolation method using in [20] [30]. First,
dut to the existence of the K¨ahler-Einstein metric ωKE and no holomorphic vector ﬁeld
condition, we derive that

for some positive constants η′, Cη′ by [33], where

is the original Ding functional corresponding to smooth Monge-Ampere equation. To
apply the interpolation, we also need to ﬁnd a group of small data µ, β1,· · · , βm such
that the corresponding properness holds. That could be done by generalizing Berman’s
log α-invariant estimate [1], which is the generalization of Tian’s α-invariant [31]. First
we introduce the deﬁnition of log α-invariant:

Deﬁnition 2.5. Fix a smooth volume form vol, for any K¨ahler class [ω0], we deﬁne log
α-invariant as below:

α([ω], D,B) = sup{α > 0 : ∃Cα < ∞ s.t.
f or any φ ∈ P SH(M, ω0)}.

For the estimate of the log α-invariant in case of simple normal crossing divisors, we

have the following lemma:
Lemma 2.6. For data µ, βr, λr where 1 ≤ r ≤ n in the main theorem, we have

α([ω], D,B) ≥ min{λ1β1,· · · , λmβm, α(K −1

M ), α(K −1

M |∩rDr )}.

(2.7)

Proof. Similar to Berman’s estimate [1], by Demailly’s work [14], it suﬃces to prove the
integrability in the deﬁnition for the functions log ||σk||2
for each positive integer k where
σk ∈ H 0(kK −1

M ). For each σk there exists nonnegative integers l1,· · · , lm such that

on each irreducible component Dr, the zero set of σ′ have at least complex codimension
1 on each Dr. Meanwhile deg σ′ ≤ k deg K −1

Similar to Berman’s estimate, by Ohsawa-Takegoshi extension theorem we have that for

Proposition 2.7. In case that cr < 1 or cr = 1 with λr > n
µ > 0 the corresponding twisted Mabuchi functional νω0,µ(ϕ) is proper.

n+1, for suﬃciently small

Recall that in [19] [24] the properness of twisted Mabuchi functional implies the proper-
ness of the corresponding twisted Ding functional, which implies the properness of the
twisted Ding functional when µ > 0 suﬃciently small. To derive the properness of all
µ ∈ (0, 1) we need such a lemma from [20] [24]:
Lemma 2.8. Suppose 0 < µ0 < µ1, write µ = (1 − t)µ0 + tµ1 where 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, we have

µFω0,µ(ϕ) ≥ (1 − t)µ0Fω0,µ(ϕ) + tµ1Fω0,µ(ϕ).

The proof is an easy application of the concavity of logarithmic functions. By this
lemma, we obtain the properness of the twisted Ding functional for all µ ∈ (0, 1). The
Theorem 2.4 is followed.

3. Approximation procedure and uniform C 0-estimate

In the last section, we obtained the properness of the twisted Ding functional for any
data µ, β1,· · · , βm satisfying the condition of Theorem 1.1. Now we expect to establish
the existence of corresponding conical K¨ahler-Einstein metric. Recall that in smooth
case [33] and one smooth divisor case [18] [20] [30], they applied continuity method.
One key ingredient is the linear theory of Laplacian in ordinary and conical along one
smooth divisor case. As such linear theory is still unknown in simple normal crossing
divisor case, in [2] they used pluripotential approach to obtain the existence of weak
solution. Now we expect to use approximation approach to establish the existence and
regularity of such solutions. Recall that we consider the solution to the equation (2.4).
We want to establish uniform estimates for such solutions and prove that the solutions
converge to the solution to the original conical Monge- Ampere equation (2.3). Actually
this approximation approach was ﬁrst used by Tian [35] to approximate conical K¨ahler-
Einstein metric and later in [24] it was used to approximate conic metrics with lower
Ricci curvature bound. As (2.4) is an ordinary smooth Monge-Ampere equation, we could
apply classical continuity method to solve this equation. More precisely, we consider the
following equation:

(ω0 + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕǫ,t)n = eh0−(1−µ)h−tϕǫ,t−Pm

r=1(1−βr) log(||Sr||2+ǫ)+aµ,ǫωn
0 ,

(3.1)

for t ∈ [0, µ]. Suppose E ∈ [0, µ] is the solvable set for t. First, when t = 0 by Yau’s
solution to Calabi conjecture [40], it is solvable so 0 ∈ E. Next, we know the linear
operator at some t ∈ E is ∆t + t, where ∆t is the Laplacian with respect to the metric

CONICAL K ¨AHLER-EINSTEIN METRICS

ωǫ,t := ω0 + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕǫ,t. We can compute the Ricci curvature of ωǫ,t :
Ric(ωǫ,t) =ω0 + (1 − µ)√−1∂ ¯∂h + t√−1∂ ¯∂ϕǫ,t +

So by Bochner’s formula, we know that the linear operator ∆t + t is invertible thus E is
open.

The most diﬃcult part is the closeness, i.e., the uniform C 0-estimate for ϕǫ,t for each
t > 0. To establish such estimate, we will prove the properness of corresponding Ding
functionals and obtain a uniform upper bound for them. Thus we can give a uniform
bound for Jω0(ϕǫ,t) which implies the uniform C 0-bound for ϕǫ,t.

we could have a uniform control of the Sobolev constant and the ﬁrst eigenvalue. Thus it
follows from standard Moser’s iteration that

Theorem 3.1. For each ǫ > 0 there exists a unique smooth solution ϕǫ to (2.4) such that

ωǫ = ω0 + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕǫ have uniform lower Ricci curvature bound µ. Moreover, |ϕǫ| ≤ C

which is independent of ǫ.

4. Convergence and high order estimates

As we have established a uniform C 0-estimate for the approximating solutions ϕǫ for
any ǫ > 0, in this section we want to prove that there exists one subsequence converging
to a weak solution of the conical Monge-Ampere equation (2.3) and such weak solution
is unique. Then we establish high order estimates for the weak solution, which completes
the proof of Theorem 1.1.

First, it is easy to see that there exists a subsequence of ϕǫ which converge to a function
ϕ ∈ P SH(M, ω0)∩ L∞ such that ϕ is a weak solution to the equation (2.3) in distribution
sense. By Berndtsson’s uniqueness theorem [3], the weak solution to (2.3) is unique.
Moreover, by Chern-Lu’s Inequality [22], as Ric(ωǫ) ≥ µωǫ, we have that

∆ǫ log trωǫω0 ≥ −atrωǫω0,

where ∆ǫ is the Laplacian of ωǫ and a is the upper bound of the bisectional curvature of
ω0. Then put

then by the inequality above we obtain that

u = log trωǫω0 − (a + 1)ϕǫ

∆ǫu ≤ eu−(a+1)c − n(a + 1),

which implies u ≤ C by maximal principle, so we have c1ω0 ≤ ωǫ. By the equation (2.3),
we obtain that

By standard high order estimate, we have that

c1ω0 ≤ ωǫ ≤

c2ω0

r=1(||Sr||2 + ǫ)(1−βr ) .
Qm

||ϕǫ||C l(K) ≤ C(l, K)

uniformly on each compact set K ∈ M \ D, which implies
Proposition 4.1. ωǫ converges to ωϕ = ω0 + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕ in current sense, and the conver-
gence is C ∞ on each compact set K ∈ M \ D. Moreover ωϕ is smooth outside the divisor
D.

Assuming the existence of L∞ weak solution to (2.3), the next step is to establish the
Laplacian estimate, i.e., the equivalence between the metric ωϕ and the standard conic
metric ωcone. In one irreducible divisor case, Brendle proved the C 3-estimates in [4] using
Calabi’s estimate when β < 1
2. For any β < 1, in [18] the Laplacian estimate follows
from Chern-Lu’s Inequality based on Li-Rubinstein’s upper bisectional curvature bound
estimate for basic type conic metrics. In simple normal crossing divisor case, one way is to
set up a new approximating approach [5] [16]. However as the approximating conic metrics
have no uniform control of bisectional curvature from either above or below, they need to

12

LIANGMING SHEN

establish a much more complicated Laplacian estimate based on Paun’s trick. Meanwhile,
in [12] Datar-Song gave a simpler estimate based on Li-Rubinstein’s estimate. Their trick
is that for each r keep the divisor Dr component and regularize other components. Then
compare each approximating solution metric with standard conic metrics along Dr with
cone angle 2πβr by Li-Rubinstein’s curvature estimate and ﬁnally the Laplacian estimate
follows.
In Fano case to construct approximating solutions both of their works need
Demailly’s regularization process [13].

In this section, we will make use of the new curvature estimate Theorem 1.2 to derive
the Laplacian estimate directly analogous to [18], without approximation and Demailly’s
regularization. The proof of Theorem 1.2 will be left to the end of this paper. Assuming
this theorem, we denote

ωbg := ω0 + ǫ

√−1∂ ¯∂||Sr||2βr + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕ0

m

Xr=1

as the background conic metric whose bisectional curvature has an upper bound Λ on
M \ D, where ǫ is small and ϕ0 ∈ P SH(M, ω0) ∩ C ∞(M). Actually it is equivalent to the
standard conic metric ωcone deﬁned in (1.3). Similar to [29] [12], for any δ > 0, put

m

Q := log(

||Sr||2δtrωϕωbg) − A(ϕ − ϕ0 − ǫ

||Sr||2βr).

Xr=1

Yr=1

On M \ D, as ωϕ has positive Ricci curvature and the bisectional curvature of ωbg is less
than Λ, using Chern-Lu’s Inequality we immediately have that

∆Q ≥ (A − Λ)trωϕωbg + δ

trωϕR(|| · ||r) − An.

Xr=1

Take A = Λ + 1 by the setting we know that the maximal of Q on M is attained at
p ∈ M \ D, where

trωϕωbg(p) ≤ −δ

trωϕR(|| · ||r) + (Λ + 1)n ≤ (Λ + 1)n,

m

Xr=1

by maximal principle. As ϕ, ϕ0 are uniformly bounded on M we conclude that it holds
that trωϕωbg ≤

r=1 ||Sr||2δ . Let δ tend to 0 we prove that

C0

By the conical Monge-Ampere equation (2.3) it is easy to see that ωn
so

ϕ is equivalent to ωn

ωϕ ≥ C1ωbg.

Thus we have proved that

ωϕ ≤ C2ωbg.

Proposition 4.2. There exist C1, C2 > 0 such that C1ωcone ≤ ωϕ ≤ C2ωcone.

CONICAL K ¨AHLER-EINSTEIN METRICS

13

Finally, to ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 1.1 we need to establish a C 2,α,B-estimate for the

solution ϕ, i.e., to show √−1∂ ¯∂ϕ is C α with respect to the standard conic metric ωcone.
By [4] in one smooth divisor case if β < 1
2 we can even ﬁnd that ||ϕ||C 3 is bounded using
Calabi’s 3rd order estimate, because in this case the bisectional curvature is uniformly
bounded outside the divisor. Actually this result could be generalized to simple normal
crossing divisors whose cone angles are all smaller than 1
2 as the bisectional curvature
is also uniformly bounded outside the divisor by the proof of Theorem 1.2 in the next
section. However, in case that β ≥ 1
2 one can only have can only have C α-bound for
√−1∂ ¯∂ϕ where α ∈ (0, min{ 1
β − 1, 1}). Based on Tian’s 3rd order estimate [36], we
could establish similar estimates in general simple normal crossing case. We refer [26] for
the generalization to simple normal crossing divisor case when some angle βr > 1
2. The
corresponding conical K¨ahler-Einstein case should be simpler than conical K¨ahler-Ricci
ﬂow case in [26]:

Proposition 4.3. If the solution ϕ of conical Monge-Ampere equation (2.3) satisﬁes that
C1ωcone ≤ ωϕ ≤ C2ωcone, then for any point p ∈ M, r < 1 and α ∈ (0, min{1, 1
β 1 −
1,· · · , 1

β m − 1}) there exists a constant Cα > 0 such that

ZBr(p) |∂ ¯∂∂ϕ|2ωn

cone ≤ Cαr2n−2+2α.

Moreover, √−1∂ ¯∂ϕ is C α-bounded.

Now the proof of Theorem 1.1 is complete.

5. Proof of Theorem 1.2

In this section we supply a detailed proof for Theorem 1.2, which is purely technical.
We will compute along Li-Rubinstein’s approach in the appendix of [18]. First, as [18],
we denote ˆg, g as the K¨ahler metrics associated to ω0, ω. Without loss of confusion we
temporarily still use ω0 to represent the whole background metric even if the precise form

is ω0 + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕ in the second case of the main theorem. Here we only deal with the

most complicated case that the point we consider is near the intersection of all divisors.
For other cases the estimates will be similar but easier. Now we extend Lemma A.2
in [18] which came from [37] originally to choose appropriate local holomorphic frames
and coordinate system near the intersection (actually by the private communication Y.
Rubinstein also gave the same extension), which we will use in the following computation:
Lemma 5.1. There exists ǫ0 > 0 such that if 0 ≤ distˆg(p, Dr) ≤ ǫ0 for all r = 1,· · · , m,
then we can choose local holomorphic frames er of each holomorphic line bundle [Dr]
and local holomorphic coordinates (z1,· · · , zn) valid in a neighborhood of p, such that
(i)Sr = zrer, and ar := ||er||2
= 0, and (ii)
ˆgi¯j(p) = 0 for i ≤ m, j > m, and ˆgi¯j,k(p) = ∂

for some nonvanishing holomorphic functions Fr to be determined later. Then we have
ar = ||Fre′
r = |Fr|2cr. Now ﬁx any point p ∈ Bˆg(q, ǫ(q)). In order for ar to satisfy
r||2
condition (i) with respect to coordinates (w1,· · · , wn) at point p, we choose Fr such that
Fr(p) = cr(p)− 1

Since cr = ||e′
r is nonzero as ǫ(q) is small, which implies |w − w(p)| is small, we can

assume Fr 6= 0 in Bˆg(q, ǫ(q)). Now Sr = f ′
holomorphic
functions. As Dr = {zr = 0} are smooth divisors, we can assume that ∂wrfr(q) 6= 0,
but ∂wsfr(q) = 0 for s 6= r among 1,· · · , m, and choose small ǫ(q), we can assume that
∂wr fr 6= 0 but ∂wsfr(q) suﬃciently small for s 6= r among 1,· · · , m, in Bˆg(q, ǫ(q)). Then
by the inverse function theorem,

rule, (i) holds locally in the new coordinates. By covering argument (i) holds globally.

For (ii), we denote by w1,· · · , wn the coordinates obtained in (i). First we can make a

coordinate change such that at the point p,

then these coordinates satisfy conditions (i) and (ii).

Proof. By Brendle’s computation in [4], we can easily bound all the terms if βi ≤ 1
2 for all
i. Now we consider the general case. As lemma A.3 in [18], we deﬁne a bilinear Hermitian
form of two tensors a = [ai¯qk], b = [bj ¯pl] ∈ (Cn)3 satisfying ai¯qk = ak ¯qi, bj ¯pl = bl ¯pj by setting

h[ai¯qk], [bj ¯pl]i := Xi,j,k,l,p,q

gp¯q(ηigi¯q,kνk)(ηjgj ¯p,lνl).

Obviously it is a nonnegative bilinear form. We denote by ||·|| the associated norm. Then
Pi,j,k,l

Πi¯jk¯l = ||[ai¯jk]||2. We write

gi¯j,k = Ai¯jk + Bi¯jk + Di¯jk + Ei¯jk

Denote A := [Ai¯qk] and similarly B, D, E. Using (5.1), we can bound ||A + B + D||2 easily.
For the crossing terms of A, B, D and E, we have that

Now let us consider ||E||2 : In case that at most two divisors intersect transversely, we can

That is why we cannot control the crossing terms in ||E||2 by its diagonal terms so well as
m = 2. Fortunately this observation implies that we can increase the diagonal terms of ˆg
such that this matrix inequality holds for the modiﬁed metric. In applications to geometric
problems we only change the metric in the same cohomology class. One natural idea is
to consider the new background metric with the following form

r) behaves as λr||Sr||2

where ϕr(||Sr||2
r for some suitable λr > 0 near Dr = (Sr = 0)
and tends to 0 far away such that it preserves the positivity of the new background
metric. This can be done by suitable cutoﬀ argument. To see how much this modiﬁcation
changes the bisectional curvature we ﬁrst compute the corresponding derivatives of the
new background metric tensors (we denote ˆg′ as the metric tensors of ω′
0) as in the previous

At the chosen point p, by our assumption that ϕr(t) = λrt when t is small and the chosen
coordinate system, we get that

ˆg′
i¯j(p) = ˆgi¯j(p) +

λr(δirδjr + O(Fr)),

m

Xr=1

Meanwhile by the order of the error terms we can easily construct cut-oﬀ functions so
that after modiﬁcation the new metric is uniformly equivalent to the original metric. And
similarly, we can also get that

ˆg′
i¯j,k(p) = ˆgi¯j,k(p) + O(1), ˆg′

i¯j,k¯l(p) = ˆgi¯j,k¯l(p) + O(1).

Using these estimates in the computation of the previous section, we ﬁnd that almost
any estimates do not change except for the estimate of ||E||2, due to the change of the
background metric tensors. Let us rewrite this formula for the modiﬁed metric:

As in the lemma 5.3, we need to control the second term by the diagonal terms. Now we
could choose λr large enough, r = 1,· · · , m so that for some constant c′

Then the corresponding estimate will follow as above and the following proposition holds:

Proposition 5.4. In general situations (triple or higher multiple singularities with arbi-

trary cone angles), there exist a smooth function ϕ0 =

Combine Lemma 5.3 and this proposition, the proof of Theorem 1.2 is ﬁnished.

6. Further discussions

In Theorem 1.1 we assume that M does not have any holomorphic vector ﬁelds, which
guarantees the properness of the smooth Ding functional or Mabuchi functional by [33].
However, in case of simple normal crossing divisor with m ≥ 2, there is no holomorphic
vector ﬁelds tangential to all the components of the divisor. In this sense, the assumption
of nonexistence of holomorphic vector ﬁelds is not necessary in the following theorem
which is modiﬁed from Theorem 1.1:

Theorem 6.1. Given a Fano manifold (M, ω0) where [ω0] = c1(M), for any simple normal
and a sequence of positive rational numbers λ1,· · · , λm satisfying

crossing divisor D =

cr[Dr] = c1(M),

(6.1)

m

Pr=1

m

Xr=1

if for all r = 1,· · · , m it holds that cr ≤ 1 and
λr := inf{λ > 0|λK −1

M − [Dr] > 0} ≥

n

n + 1

in case that cr = 1, then for µ > 0 small enough, and β1,· · · , βm ∈ (0, 1) satisﬁes

1 − βr = (1 − µ)cr,

there exists a unique C 2,α,B conical K¨ahler-Einstein metric in c1(M) with cone angle 2πβr
along each irreducible divisor Dr for r = 1,· · · , m. Moreover in case that M admits a
conical K¨ahler-Einstein metric ωµ0 ∈ c1(M) such that

Ric(ωµ0) = µ0ωµ0 +

2π(1 − βr,0)[Dr]

m

Xr=1

then for µ ∈ (0, µ0), the above existence result still hold.

Note that the properness of the twisted Ding functional corresponding to µ0 could be
derived from a modiﬁcation of [38] and we want to thank Professor X. H. Zhu for pointing
out this to us.

Another interesting problem is the requirement of the coeﬃcients cr, λr. In one smooth
divisor case, by [20] [30] such similar requirement is necessary due to the obstruction of
log-K stability and the example of P2 with a quadratic curve shows this point. But in
the case of simple normal crossing divisor with m ≥ 2, such obstruction will not exist

CONICAL K ¨AHLER-EINSTEIN METRICS

23

due to the nonexistence of holomorphic vector ﬁelds tangential all the components and
we do not know whether our theorem could be extended or not due to another unknown
obstruction. We hope to investigate and analyze more general cases in the future.
