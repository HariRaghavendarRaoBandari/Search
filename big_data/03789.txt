FINITENESS OF LOCAL TORSION

FOR ABELIAN t-MODULES

VESSELIN DIMITROV

Abstract. Let C/Fq be a regular projective curve, ∞ ∈ C a
closed point, A := Γ(C − {∞}, OC), and K := K(C) the fraction
ﬁeld of A. Consider a ﬁnite extension L/K, a place v of L, and
an abelian A-module M (in the sense of Anderson) over Lv. We
prove that the Lv-rational torsion submodule M (Lv)tors of M is a
ﬁnite A-module.

1. Introduction

1.1. The present note is motivated by a conjecture in algebraic dy-
namics over local ﬁelds of positive characteristic. It arose as a question
in Fakhruddin’s paper [3], where among other results it was proven
that a morphism ϕ : PN
Zp of degree at least two possesses only
ﬁnitely many Qp-rational preperiodic points. (It is crucial here that
ϕ is deﬁned over Zp and not merely over Qp, as is evidenced by the
iteration z 7→ (zp − z)/p of P1
Qp, all of whose preperiodic points lie in
Zp ∪{∞}.) The following Fq[[T ]]-counterpart of this statement remains
open.

Zp → PN

Conjecture 1. Let ϕ : PN
Fq[[T ]] be a morphism of degree at
least two. Then, ϕ has only ﬁnitely many Fq((T ))-valued preperiodic
points.

Fq[[T ]] → PN

It is shown in [3] that there is an n > 0 such that all periods of
Fq((T ))-valued points for ϕn are powers of the equicharacteristic p.
See also Zieve’s thesis [7], Theorem 50, for a more precise result in the
case N = 1.

1.2. An evidence for Conjecture 1 is the well known fact that an
abelian variety A over any non-archimedean local ﬁeld F has ﬁnite
torsion group: #A(F )tors < ∞. See, for example, Clark and Xarles [2].
Here, F can be a p-adic ﬁeld Qp as well as a Laurent series ﬁeld Fq((T ));
hence, the analog of Conjecture 1 holds for an isogeny ϕ : A → A of
degree at least two.

In function ﬁeld arithmetic the counterpart of an abelian variety
1.3.
is the notion of an abelian t-module, introduced by Anderson in [1]. It
includes, as the special case of dimension one, the notion of a Drinfeld
module. The isogenies of such modules over Fq((T )) give rise to par-
ticularly well behaved additive endomorphisms of aﬃne space AN
Fq((T ));
many of them extend as endomorphisms of PN
Fq((T )). The class of ad-
ditive polynomials is of particular interest in Conjecture 1. We show
that no counterexamples arise from an abelian t-module, by proving
the analog of the ﬁniteness result about abelian varieties in 1.2.

1.4. To state our result, we need to introduce some notation. Let C/Fq
be a regular, projective, geometrically connected curve, and consider
a closed point ∞ ∈ C, declared as the place at inﬁnity. Consider
the ring A := Γ(C − {∞}, OC) of functions on C regular outside ∞,
and K its quotient ﬁeld (the function ﬁeld of C). Let further L/K
be a ﬁnite extension, v a place of L, and Lv the v-adic completion.
An Anderson A-module of dimension d over Lv is a homomorphism
Φ : A → End(Gd
) such that, for every f ∈ A, the derivative (zeroth
)) ∼= Md(Lv) has all its eigenvalues

equal to f .

Let τ : x 7→ xq be the Frobenius substitution and Lv{τ } the twisted
Frobenius ring deﬁned by the commutation relation τ c = cqτ , for
c ∈ Lv. An A-module Φ over Lv endows Hom(Gd
, Ga/Lv ) with an
A⊗Fq Lv−Lv{τ } bimodule structure in an obvious way. Then, following
Anderson [1], Φ is said to be an abelian A-module if Hom(Gd
, Ga/Lv )
is free of ﬁnite rank as A⊗Fq Lv-module. The latter condition is equiva-
lent to the ﬁnite generation of the A ⊗Fq Lv-module Hom(Gd
, Ga/Lv )
(see [1], Lemma 1.4.5).

Theorem 2. Let Φ be an abelian A-module over Lv. Then, the Lv-
rational torsion module

{x ∈ Gd

a(Lv) | Φ(f )(x) = 0 for some f ∈ A \ {0}}

is a ﬁnite A-module.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we consider the ﬁlled
Julia A-module of Φ and prove that it is bounded. It is here that the
hypothesis that Φ is abelian is used in a crucial way; we do not know if
the statement of our theorem continues to hold for arbitrary Anderson
A-modules. In section 3 we consider the formal module attached to
an Anderson A-module over the valuation ring of Lv and exploit the
positive radius of convergence of the exponential map. The proof of
Theorem 2 is then completed in section 4.

2. Boundedness of the filled Julia module

Let Φ be an Anderson A-module over Lv. Thus Gd

a(Lv) acquires an
A-module structure via Φ. We follow Ingram [4] in deﬁning the Lv-
rational ﬁlled Julia module ΦFJ(Lv) to be the A-submodule consisting
of the x ∈ Gd
a(Lv) having v-adically bounded A-orbit. Ingram works
with the case d = 1 of Drinfeld modules, and he extends the deﬁnition
of ΦFJ to the Berkovich aﬃne line to consider the connected component
of the identity.

For our purpose of proving ﬁniteness of local torsion, the consider-
ation of the Lv-rational part of ΦFJ is suﬃcient. The following higher
dimensional result is also due to Ingram and is essentially contained in
the unpublished manuscript [5]. The short proof presented here was
found independently by the present author, following the idea of the
one dimensional case presented in [4].

Lemma 2.1 (Ingram). If Φ is abelian, the set ΦFJ(Lv) is v-adically
bounded.

Proof. Let m1, . . . , md : Gd
a → Ga be the coordinate projections. They
form a free basis of M := Hom(Gd
, Ga/Lv ) as Lv{τ }-module. Our
assumption is that M is also ﬁnitely generated as A ⊗Fq Lv-module; let
α1, . . . , αr be a set of generators.

a/Lv

Write also v : Lv \ {0} ։ Z for the normalized valuation of the local

ﬁeld Lv. We claim that for all n ∈ N and i there is a presentation

(1)

τ nmi =

rX

j=1

(fijn ⊗ cijn)αj,

v(cijn) ≥ −Cqn,

where C < ∞ is a constant independent of n.

The claim implies our desired conclusion. Indeed, if v(mi(x)) < −2C
for some i then v(τ nmi(x)) = qnv(mi(x)) < −2Cqn, and (1) as n →
+∞ shows that x cannot lie in the ﬁlled Julia set: otherwise it would
hold v((fijn ⊗ cijn)αj(x)) = v(cijnαj(Φfijn(x))) ≥ v(cijn) + On(1) for
all j.

To prove our claim, note that τ · (f ⊗ c)α = (f ⊗ cq)τ α with v(cq) =
qv(c). Since by assumption the mi and the τ αj can be expressed as
A ⊗Fq Lv-linear combinations in α1, . . . , αr, a presentation (1) follows
by induction on n.
(cid:3)

Remark.

It is essential in Lemma 2.1 that Φ be abelian; the trivial
t-module given by Φt : x 7→ tx over Fq(t) has ΦFJ(Lv) = Lv for all v.
This reaﬃrms that abelian t-modules are the correct analog of abelian
In this analogy, the basic boundedness result veriﬁed here

corresponds to the existence of the N´eron model. This parallel was
detailed by Ingram in [4] for the case of dimension one (Drinfeld mod-
ules). It would be interesting more generally to study the structure of
the component A-module of the ﬁlled Julia set of Φ on the Berkovich
aﬃne space Ad,an
. (The ﬁeld Cv in the notation here is, as usual, the
/Cv
completion of an algebraic closure of Lv.)

3. The formal module

Let Ov be the valuation ring of Lv and mv its maximal ideal. In this

section we assume Φ is an Anderson A-module over Lv such that

(2)

Φ(f ) ≡ f 1d + Nf mod mvMd(Ov{τ })

for all f ∈ A. Here, as required by the deﬁnition of an Anderson
module, Nf ∈ Md(Lv) is a nilpotent matrix. Any A-module over Lv
can be brought to such a form by conjugation with a scalar.

For f /∈ mv ∩ A, the element Φ(f ) ∈ Md(Lv{τ }) satisfying (2) can
be inverted in Md(Lv{τ }) + mvMd(Ov{{τ }}) ⊂ Md(Lv{{τ }}). In this
way, letting R := Amv ∩A the local ring of Spec A at mv ∩ A, we obtain
a formal Anderson R-module

bΦ : R → Md(Lv{{τ }})

over Lv, such that for all r ∈ R, bΦ(r)(x) converges in Gd
x ∈ Gd

3.1. The formal logarithm. The proof of Prop. 2.1 in Rosen [6]
(which treats the case d = 1) extends almost verbatim to yield a unique

lΦ ∈ Md(Lv{{τ }}) satisfying Dl bΦ = 1d and l bΦ ◦bΦ(r) = rl bΦ for all r ∈ R.
We indicate the necessary changes. As in loc. cit., given the ﬁrst
identity Dl bΦ = 1d, it is enough to verify the second identity for r = π,
a ﬁxed generator for the maximal ideal of R. Write bΦ(π) = π1d + Nπ +
Pn≥1 Bnτ n and l = 1d + Pn≥1 Cnτ n with Nπ nilpotent and undeter-
Then l bΦ ◦ bΦ(π) = πl bΦ translates into the recursion

Since Nπ is nilpotent, the coeﬃcient on the left-hand side of (3) is
invertible for all n ≥ 1, and equals the scalar matrix (π − πqn)1d for
n ≫ 0. As in [6], we see from this description that (3) deﬁnes uniquely
the desired l bΦ, and that l bΦ(x) converges for x ∈ Gd
a(mv). Moreover,

writing as before mi : Gd
Ov ։ Z the normalized valuation, we obtain:

a → Ga the coordinate projections and v :

Lemma 3.1. There is a k1 = k1(Φ) < ∞ such that, for x ∈ Gd
it holds v(mi(l bΦ(x))) = v(mi(x)), for i = 1, . . . , d.

3.2. The exponential map. This is the inverse

e bΦ := l−1

of the formal logarithm. It satisﬁes e bΦr = bΦ(r)e bΦ for all r ∈ R.
Lemma 3.2. There is a k2 = k2(Φ) such that e bΦ converges on Gd
and has v(mi(e bΦ(x))) = v(mi(x)), i = 1, . . . , d, for all x ∈ Gd
Proof. This follows from the same calculations as in Propositions 2.2
and 2.3 of Rosen [6] (who considers the case d = 1). In fact, e bΦ con-
verges for all x having v(mi(x)) > e/(q − 1) for all i = 1, . . . , d, where
e is the ramiﬁcation index of Ov/R.

3.3. Conclusion. Combining Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2, let

k := max(k1, k2) < ∞.

We obtain:

Corollary 3. If x ∈ Gd
then x = 0.

a(mk

v) has Φ(f )(x) = 0 for some f ∈ A \ {0},

Proof. We also have bΦ(f )(x) = 0. Evaluating e bΦr = bΦ(r)e bΦ at l bΦ(x)
we obtain e bΦ(f l bΦ(x)) = 0. Since f 6= 0, the two lemmas then yield
x = 0.
(cid:3)

4. Finiteness of local rational torsion

Combining Lemma 2.1 and Corollary 3 we can now complete the
proof of Theorem 2. First of all, as noted at the beginning of section 3,
conjugating Φ by a scalar λ with v(λ) ≫ 0 we may assume, for all
f ∈ A, that Φ(f ) satisﬁes condition (2). (The j-th matrix coeﬃcient
of λ−1Φλ is λd(qj −1) times the corresponding coeﬃcient of Φ.) Then
Corollary 3 applies, for some k = k(Φ) < ∞. Since the A-modules
Φ and λ−1Φλ are isomorphic over Lv, we lose no generality in making
this reduction.

Let us now ﬁx a non-constant element f ∈ A. By Lemma 2.1 and
the pigeonhole principle, there is an M = M(k) < ∞ such that, for all
x ∈ ΦFJ(Lv), there are 0 ≤ j1 < j2 ≤ M such that mi(Φ(f j1)(x)) ≡
mi(Φ(f j2)(x)) mod mk
v for i = 1, . . . , d; this means Φ(f j1 − f j2)(x) ∈

a(mk

v). Since each Lv-rational torsion point is in ΦFJ(Lv) by the def-
Gd
inition of the Lv-rational ﬁlled Julia module, this together with Corol-
lary 3 yields a ﬁnite set F ⊂ A of non-zero elements of A such that
every Lv-rational torsion point for Φ has order belonging to F . Alto-
gether, this yields ﬁniteness for the Lv-rational torsion.

5. Acknowledgements

At the time of writing of this note I was unaware of Ingram’s un-
published manuscript [5], where the compactness of the adelic ﬁlled
Julia module of an abelian A-module φ over a global function ﬁeld had
been proved and used to derive that the torsion module of φ consists
of points of bounded height. In any case the short proof given here of
Lemma 2.1 follows the idea in Ingram’s earlier paper [4] treating the
case of a Drinfeld module. It is a pleasure to thank Patrick Ingram
for sending me his manuscript [5], and Najmuddin Fakhruddin, Dragos
Ghioca and Patrick Ingram for several enlightening remarks about the
problem considered here.
