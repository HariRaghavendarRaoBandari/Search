We show numerically that a harmonically trapped and coherently Rabi-coupled three-component
Bose–Einstein condensate can host unconventional vortex lattices in its rotating ground state. The
discovered lattices incorporate square and zig-zag patterns, vortex dimers and chains, and doubly
quantized vortices, and they can be quantitatively classiﬁed in terms of a skyrmionic topological
index. These complex states arise due to the intricate interplay of the repulsive density–density
interactions and the Rabi couplings as well as the ubiquitous phase frustration between the com-
ponents.
In the frustrated state, domain walls in the relative phases can persist between some
components even at strong Rabi coupling, while vanishing between others. Consequently, in this
limit the three-component condensate eﬀectively approaches a two-component condensate with only
density–density interactions. At intermediate Rabi coupling strengths, however, we face unique
vortex physics which occurs neither in the two-component counterpart nor in the purely density–
density-coupled three-component system.

INTRODUCTION

Since the experimental creation of large vortex lat-
tices in rotating single-component Bose–Einstein con-
densates (BECs) of atomic gases [1–3], there has been
growing interest in studying the rotational response of
BECs with multiple components [4]. The physics of
such superﬂuid mixtures is more intricate because the
competing eﬀects enter not only via the self-interaction
of a single component but also through intercompo-
nent interactions [5, 6]. In terms of ﬁnding the energy-
minimizing vortex conﬁguration, this means that the rel-
ative positioning of vortices in diﬀerent components also
profoundly aﬀects the total energy.
In addition, two
diﬀerent regimes can be distinguished: the immiscible
regime, where the components separate into nonoverlap-
ping phases, and the miscible regime with interpenetrat-
ing BECs [6].

The versatility of the emerging ground-state vortex
structures is apparent already in the simplest multicom-
ponent case, the two-component BEC, which has been
realized experimentally, e.g., with two hyperﬁne spin
states of atoms of the same species [7–13]. A rapidly
rotating miscible two-component BEC with equally pop-
ulated and repulsively interacting components was shown
to form vortex lattices whose geometry can change from
triangular to rectangular, with the lattice unit cells of the
two components displaced relative to each other [14, 15].
Subsequently, a two-component mass-imbalanced BEC
with attractive intercomponent interactions was shown
to host vortex lattices that vary from a square lattice to a

∗ milorad.milosevic@uantwerpen.be

triangular lattice of vortex pairs (dimers) [16]. In the im-
miscible regime corresponding to strong intercomponent
repulsion, rotating harmonically trapped two-component
BECs undergo a phase separation leading to serpentine
vortex sheets [17] or, when the components are unequally
populated, to a giant vortex surrounded by a ring of
single-quantum vortices [18]. The ground state of a ro-
tating two-component BEC can also host spin-texture
skyrmions [18–21] or a solitary multiquantum vortex [21].

Moreover, a two-component BEC consisting of two hy-
perﬁne spin states of the same atom can be coupled
not only by density–density interactions but also co-
herently, so that the complex phases of the condensate
wave functions are no longer independent of each other.
When rotated, such Rabi-coupled two-component BECs
were found to contain vortex dimers (also called meron
pairs [22, 23]), and multidimer bound states made up
of four or six individual vortices from diﬀerent compo-
nents [24]. The dimer and multidimer bound states were
shown to emerge due to the Rabi coupling giving rise
to energy-costing domain walls in the relative phase be-
tween the two components [24, 25]. In eﬀect, the domain
walls conﬁne vortices in diﬀerent components into bound
vortex molecules [24, 25]. With increasing strength of the
Rabi coupling, the domain wall between the bound vor-
tices shrinks and eventually vanishes, merging the con-
stituent vortices into an “integer vortex” (with the same
phase winding in each component) [24–26]. Thus, the
Rabi coupling induces an attractive interaction between
same-sign vortices in diﬀerent components. For a more
detailed study of vortex–vortex interactions in multicom-
ponent BECs, we refer to the work of Dantas et al. [27].

The sign of the Rabi coupling does not play a role
in the ground state of the Rabi-coupled two-component

BEC, since one can always multiply either of the conden-
sate wave functions by a global U(1) phase factor to ob-
tain a ground-state solution with an attractive Rabi en-
ergy. However, the situation becomes signiﬁcantly more
involved when there are more than two coherently cou-
pled components in the system. Such a case, with three
Rabi-coupled BEC components, has been studied earlier
in Ref. [28] but only in the unfrustrated parameter regime
where all three pairwise Rabi energies can be simulta-
neously attractive at the same point in space.
In this
work, we investigate coherently coupled three-component
BECs in the other regime where the Rabi energies nec-
essarily exhibit intrinsic phase frustration. Speciﬁcally,
we show that the interplay of the intrinsic Rabi frustra-
tion with the other interactions and superﬂuidity of the
system can result in the emergence of exotic ground-state
vortex lattices when the system is rotated. Fixing the rel-
ative phases of two pairs already ﬁxes the relative phase
of the remaining pair. This can result in the suppression
of some of the three pairwise Rabi couplings and gen-
erally leads to the existence of phase-frustrated vortex
lattices with unconventional features such as zig-zag pat-
terns, vortex chains, and doubly quantized vortices. In
the limit of strong Rabi coupling, the phase frustration
causes the three-component BEC to behave eﬀectively
as a two-component BEC with only density–density in-
teractions. Consequently, we also observe a triangular-
to-square transition in the ground-state vortex lattice in
agreement with previous results for the two-component
system [14, 15, 20].

The overall repulsive interaction between diﬀerent
components tends to favor interlacing of vortices in dif-
ferent components, splitting composite integer vortices
into separate entities. Although each component has,
on average, the same overall circulation determined by
the external rotation frequency, the vortices of the sys-
tem can no longer be satisfactorily described by a single
winding number. For this reason, we invoke a topological
index deﬁned in terms of a CP 2 invariant [29] and use
it to classify the observed nontrivial states. This clas-
siﬁcation has a broader scope in multicomponent quan-
tum physics, since the relative phase frustration appears
not only in coherently coupled three-component BECs
but also in multiband superconductors [30–34], where it
accounts for, i.a., fractional vortices [35], solitons [26],
skyrmions [29, 36, 37], and vortex sheets [38].

The remainder of the article is organized as follows: In
Sec. II, we outline the theoretical description of the co-
herently coupled rotating three-component BECs. Sec-
tion III presents our main results, summarized in two
vortical/skyrmionic lattice phase diagrams, with the dis-
covered domains illustrated with representative ground-
state solutions. The physical interpretation of the ob-
tained lattices is given in terms of the topological in-
dex (Sec. III A), intrinsic phase suppression of the Rabi
coupling (Sec. III B), and domain walls (Sec. III C). Fi-
nally, we summarize our ﬁndings and discuss the outlook
in Sec. IV.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

Our starting point is a harmonically trapped three-
component BEC consisting of three diﬀerent spin states
of a single atomic species, coupled coherently to each
other. We use the standard zero-temperature mean-
ﬁeld approach [5] and describe the condensate with three
complex-valued wave functions Ψi, where i ∈ {1, 2, 3}.
For simplicity, we focus on the case of a highly oblate
cylindrically symmetric trapping potential with the har-
monic trap frequencies satisfying ωz ≫ ωx = ωy ≡ ω,
which implies that the BEC is quasi-two-dimensional and
the z dependence can be integrated out. Assuming that
the system is set into rotation about the z axis with an-
gular frequency Ω, we write the two-dimensional Gross-
Pitaevskii (GP) energy functional [28] in the rotating
frame of the system as

terized by the intra- and intercomponent coupling con-
stants gii and gij (= gji), respectively. We assume that
g11 = g22 = g33 and g12 = g13 = g23. The additional ef-
fective coupling constants ωij (= ωji ∈ R) in Eq. (1) are
known as the Rabi frequencies that interlink the phases
of the components [39, 40]. They can be experimen-
tally realized and their values controlled by externally
applied electromagnetic ﬁelds. Accordingly, we call the
last term in Eq. (1) the Rabi energy and denote the cor-

responding energy density as εR = PPi<j εij, where
εij = −ωij(Ψ∗

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We have numerically solved the GP equations of the
rotating three-component BEC in the presence of both
density–density and Rabi couplings [Eqs. (4)]. In all the
states we present, we have ﬁxed the intracomponent cou-
pling strength to g = g11mN/32 = 2115 and the ro-
tation frequency to Ω = 0.97ω. On the other hand, we
treat the relative intercomponent density–density cou-
pling strength σ and the Rabi frequency ω12 as variables
in the intervals 0 < σ ≤ 1 and −0.12ω ≤ ω12 ≤ −0.01ω
in order to study their eﬀect on the ground-state vortex
lattices of the system. We assume the other two Rabi
frequencies ω13 and ω23 to be equal and consider two dif-
ferent ﬁxed values, ω13 = ω23 = 0.01ω and ω13 = ω23 =
0.05ω, since these already convey many of the key phe-
nomena related to the Rabi coupling. Hence, we end up
with two diﬀerent ﬁxed parameter sets (g, Ω, ω, ω13, ω23)
and the dimensionless variables σ and ω12/ω. The results
for the two parameter sets are presented as two phase di-
agrams in the plane of σ and ω12/ω in Figs. 7 and 13. In
the remainder of this section, we will analyze the phase
diagrams in detail (Sec. III A) and discuss the emerging
phenomena of Rabi suppression (Sec. III B) and domain
walls (Sec. III C). We recall from Ref. [42] that when the
Rabi couplings are not present, only triangular lattices
were observed in the rotating ground states in the range
0 ≤ σ < 1.

A. Lattice phase diagrams

Let us ﬁrst consider the ﬁxed Rabi frequencies ω13 =
ω23 = 0.01ω, and vary the interspecies interaction
strength and the remaining Rabi frequency in the ranges

Figure 1. Rotating ground state for the intercomponent in-
teraction strength σ = g12/g11 = 0.2 and the dominant Rabi
frequency ω12/ω = −0.01. The panels show (a)–(c) atomic
densities |Ψ1|2, |Ψ2|2, and |Ψ3|2, respectively; (d) total den-
sity ntot; (e) negative Rabi energy density −εR; (f) vortices
of each component on top of −εR, with (blue) squares, (pink)
dots, and (green) triangles denoting vortices in the wave
functions Ψ1, Ψ2, and Ψ3, respectively; (g) − cos ϕ12, where
ϕij = arg (Ψi) − arg (Ψj); (h) cos ϕ13; (i) cos ϕ23. Panel (f)
also indicates the unit cell of the combined vortex lattice. The
average topological index ˜Q = 2 for this state [see Eq. (6)]. In
the grayscale images, white (black) is used for largest (small-
est) values. This state corresponds to the intracomponent
interaction strength g = g11mN/32 = 2115, rotation fre-
quency Ω/ω = 0.97, and Rabi frequencies ω13 = ω23 = 0.01ω.
The ﬁeld of view in panels (f)–(i) is 11ar × 11ar, where
ar = p/mω, showing the central portion of the harmonic
trap.

0 ≤ σ ≤ 1 and 0.01 ≤ −ω12 ≤ 0.12ω, respectively. This
results in a diverse set of ground-state vortex lattices,
examples of which are depicted in Figs. 1–6. For each so-
lution, we present the density |Ψi|2 of each component,
the total density ntot = Pi |Ψi|2, and the Rabi energy
density εR; we also locate the vortices and present the
relative complex phases between the components using
the quantities sgn (ωij) cos(ϕi − ϕj), where sgn is the
sign function, i < j, and ϕi = arg (Ψi). We will refer
to these ﬁgures when discussing the related phenomena
in the subsequent sections.

For 0 ≤ σ ≤ 0.7 and ω12 ≤ 0.04ω, and also in the
small region where 0.7 < σ ≤ 0.9 and −ω12 ≤ 0.03ω,
all three components host triangular vortex lattices as
shown in Figs. 1(a)-(c). For −ω12 > 0.04ω and σ ≥ 0.3,
the three triangular lattices are interlaced with one an-
other. However, for −ω12 > 0.03ω and σ < 0.3, vor-

ical index ˜Q = 2/3 for this state. The ﬁeld of view in panels

tices in components 1 and 2 move on top of each other
to form overlapping triangular vortex lattices [Figs. 2(a)-
(c)], which are in turn interlaced by the triangular lattice
in component 3. Together they constitute a honeycomb
lattice of local minima in the total density ntot as shown
in Fig. 2(d).

For σ ≥ 0.3 and increased |ω12|, the triangular vortex
lattices in components 1 and 2 are replaced by overlap-
ping square lattices of vortex dimers, while component 3
hosts an interlacing square lattice of solitary vortices. In
the range 0.3 ≤ σ ≤ 0.7, the alignment of the dimers
exhibits small distortions in the center region of the lat-
tice as shown in Figs. 3(a)-(b). However, with a fur-
ther increase in the intercomponent repulsion to σ = 0.8,
the dimers become globally tilted with respect to the
square unit cell of their underlying lattice [Figs. 4(a)
and 4(b)]. Both the vortex lattice in component 3 and
the lattice of minima in ntot [Figs. 3(d) and 4(d)] remain
square throughout this region. Note in particular that at
σ = 0.7, neither ntot [Fig. 3(d)] nor the Rabi energy den-
sity εR [Fig. 3(e)] shows the lattice distortions appearing
in components 1 and 2.

Finally, the region σ = 1, corresponding to strong in-
tercomponent repulsion, can be considered as the border
that separates miscible and immiscible regimes. Here,
two phases can be distinguished with varying ω12. For

0.01ω ≤ −ω12 ≤ 0.04ω, we obtain interlacing triangu-
lar vortex-dimer lattices in components 1 and 2, while a
triangular lattice of doubly quantized fused-core vortices
forms in component 3 [Figs. 5(a)-(c)]. A fused-core vor-
tex comprises two singly quantized vortices practically
coalesced into a single, doubly quantized defect, or at
least to within a distance smaller than the core diame-
ter of the constituent vortices. The apparent elliptical
shape of the combined defect is due to the small sepa-
ration of the phase singularities. In the second phase at
σ = 1, which occurs for 0.5ω ≤ −ω12 ≤ 0.12ω, compo-
nent 1 hosts a honeycomb vortex lattice, component 2
a triangular lattice of vortex dimers, and component 3
a triangular lattice of fused-core vortices [Figs. 6(a)-(c),
respectively]. Furthermore, we note that the Rabi energy
density exhibits a honeycomb spatial structure [Fig. 6(e)].
All these states can actually be topologically character-
ized as containing two-dimensional skyrmions. Accord-
ing to Ref. [29], skyrmions in a K-component model in
two spatial dimensions can be deﬁned by the CP K−1
topological invariant

In Eq. (5), ǫαβ
is the Levi-Civita symbol, α, β ∈ {x, y}, and Ψ† =

ried over the elementary unit cell of the combined three-
component vortex lattice. The topological index is zero
for an integer vortex, i.e., when the vortices reside on
top of each other in all components.
In our case, we
deal with two types of states: in the ﬁrst type, three in-
terlacing lattices form in all three component at small
values of |ω12|, while in the second type, when |ω12| is in-
creased, we ﬁnd overlapping vortex lattices in component
1 and 2. Examples of states of each type are presented
in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. If we calculate the CP 2
topological index for each of these two states, we obtain
the same Q = 2 per combined-lattice unit cell, although
they clearly constitute two diﬀerent phases. Therefore,
in order to better distinguish diﬀerent phases, we instead
calculate pairwise CP 1 topological indices Qij , by using
Eq. (5) separately for each pair of the components, and
then calculate an average topological index ˜Q for the en-
tire three-component state as

˜Q = Q12 + Q13 + Q23

(6)

We stress that each Qij is calculated over the same unit
cell of the three-component lattice. In panel (f) of Figs. 1–
6, we mark vortices of each component on top of the Rabi

energy density εR and also indicate the lattice unit cell
(by black solid line). To illustrate the use of Eq. (6), let
us consider, for example, the state shown in Fig. 1, for
which the unit cell is the rectangle that connects four
vortices of component 2 [denoted by (pink) dots]. The
rectangle encloses two vortices of each component. As
a result, the pairwise topological indices are Q12 = 2,
Q13 = 2, and Q23 = 2. The average topological index for
the state is ˜Q = 2. On the other hand, calculating the
average topological index for the state shown in Fig. 2 in
the same manner gives ˜Q = 4/3, because the individual
vortices of component 1 and 2 reside on top of each other
and hence Q12 = 0.
By calculating the average topological index ˜Q from
Eq. (6) for all the obtained states and collecting the re-
sults, we obtain the phase diagram shown in Fig. 7. It
classiﬁes the diﬀerent types of ground-state skyrmionic
lattices for the ﬁxed Rabi couplings ω13 = ω23 = 0.01ω
in the two-dimensional domain 0 ≤ σ ≤ 1 and 0.01ω ≤
−ω12 ≤ 0.14ω. The states with ˜Q = 2 in the range
0 ≤ σ < 1 correspond to skyrmionic lattices with two
vortices per component in a rectangular unit cell result-
ing from an interlacing triangular vortex lattice in each
component (Fig. 1). The states with ˜Q = 4/3 have a
parallelogram unit cell and overlapping triangular lat-
tices in components 1 and 2 (Fig. 2). The states with
˜Q = 2/3 correspond to overlapping square lattices of vor-

Figure 7. Skyrmionic-lattice phase diagram as a function
of the intercomponent interaction strength σ and the Rabi
frequency ω12, for ﬁxed intracomponent interaction strength
g = 2115, external rotation frequency Ω/ω = 0.97, and Rabi
frequencies ω13 = ω23 = 0.01ω. Each number corresponds
to a numerically solved ground state of the three-component
Bose–Einstein condensate and indicates the corresponding av-
erage topological index ˜Q [Eq. (6)] per elementary unit cell
of the combined three-component vortex lattice. The (green)
solid lines are guides to the eye for separating diﬀerent phases.

tex dimers in components 1 and 2, an interlacing square
vortex lattice in component 3, and a square unit cell that
contains one vortex of each component (Figs. 3 and 4).
The states with ˜Q = 2 at σ = 1 have a hexagonal unit cell
which includes two vortices of each component. At larger
|ω12|, this phase changes into a skyrmionic lattice with
˜Q = 4/3 because of overlapping lattices in components 1
and 2.
We now turn to the second parameter set, which diﬀers
from the ﬁrst by having ω13 = ω23 = 0.05ω, and the Rabi
coupling ω12 changes in the range 0.03ω ≤ −ω12 ≤ 0.14ω.
For this given parameter set, in the range 0 < σ ≤ 0.4
and −ω12 < 0.09ω, components 1 and 2 host interlacing
zig-zag vortex lattices, which are in turn both interlaced
by a triangular vortex lattice in component 3, similar to
ones shown in Figs. 8(a)-(c). For −ω12 & 0.09ω, the zig-
zag lattices in components 1 and 2 start to overlap, while
the interlacing triangular lattice in component 3 remains
unchanged. An example of the state with overlapping
zig-zag lattices in components 1 and 2 is shown in Fig. 8.
The total density for both kinds of states exhibits a plane-
wave-like modulation [Fig. 8(d)].

ω12 < 0.1ω correspond to components 1 and 3 exhibit-
ing zig-zag vortex lattices and component 2 forming a
square vortex lattice that interlaces both zig-zag lattices.
An example from this range is shown in Fig. 9. The cor-
responding total density is depicted in Fig. 9(d) and ex-
hibits a square pattern. In the same range of intercompo-
nent repulsion, 0.5 ≤ σ ≤ 0.8, but for −ω12 > 0.1ω, zig-
zag lattices instead form in components 1 and 2, which
are interlaced by a square vortex lattice in component
3 (Fig. 10). Both ntot and εR have a square pattern
[Figs. 10(d) and (e)].

For σ = 0.9 and 0.03ω ≤ −ω12 < 0.1ω, the system
hosts triangular dimer lattices in components 1 and 2
and parallel straight chains of vortices in component 3.
An example from this region is shown in Fig. 11. With
further increasing |ω12|, the vortices in components 1 and
2 eventually move on top of each other and form fully
overlapping triangular dimer lattices for 0.1ω < −ω12 ≤
0.14ω.
At σ = 1, we identify two diﬀerent phases. For
0.03ω ≤ −ω12 < 0.1ω, the system hosts mutually in-
terlaced triangular lattices of dimers in all three compo-
nents (Fig. 12). The other phase occurs for −ω12 & 0.1ω
and has overlapping triangular lattices of dimers in com-
ponents 1 and 2 and an interlacing triangular lattice of
dimers in component 3.

The states shown in Figs. 8–12 are also amenable to

skyrmionic classiﬁcation in terms of the average topolog-
ical index per unit cell of the total lattice [Eq. (6)]. The
corresponding phase diagram of appropriate skyrmionic
lattices for these states is shown in Fig. 13. For the states
with ˜Q = 2 in the range 0 < σ ≤ 0.4, the unit cell is a
rectangle that contains two vortices of each component
[Fig. 8(f)]. The skyrmionic lattices with ˜Q = 4/3 in the
same range of σ correspond to the states with overlap-
ping zig-zag vortex lattices in component 1 and 2, so that
the pairwise topological index Q12 = 0. The region with
˜Q = 1 in 0.4 < σ ≤ 0.8 corresponds to a skyrmionic lat-
tice with a parallelogram unit cell containing one vortex
of each component [Fig. 9(f)]. With increasing |ω12| this
phase changes into a skyrmionic lattice with ˜Q = 2/3
[Fig. 10(f)]. At σ = 0.9, we distinguish two phases, with
˜Q = 1 and ˜Q = 2/3, where in both cases the unit cell en-
closes one vortex of each component and is similar to the
one shown in Fig. 11(f). Finally, the region at σ = 1.0
also shows two phases with the average topological in-
dices ˜Q = 2 and ˜Q = 4/3. The unit cell contains two
vortices of each component and is as shown in Fig. 12(f).
The latter phase with ˜Q = 4/3 emerges due to overlap-
ping triangular lattices of dimers in components 1 and 2,
which reduces Q12 to zero.

B. Rabi suppression in the three-component

system

In the Rabi-coupled two-component BEC, the sign of
the Rabi frequency ω12 is irrelevant for the ground-state
energetics because the system can freely adjust the global
phase diﬀerence between Ψ1 and Ψ2 to minimize the Rabi
energy. Consequently, ω12 = ω0 and ω12 = −ω0 (ω0 ∈ R)
will yield physically identical ground-state solutions with
attractive Rabi energy ER ≤ 0 that favors the overlap of
same-sign vortices between the two components. In the
three-component counterpart, however, the signs of ωij
make a diﬀerence, and can result in intrinsic frustration
and consequent suppression of some or all of the three
pairwise Rabi couplings.

In order to heuristically see how the Rabi suppres-
sion emerges in the three-component BEC, consider the
wave functions in the vicinity of a vortex, for exam-
ple, in component 1. In local polar coordinates (r′, φ′)
with the vortex at r′ = 0, we write the wave functions
as Ψj (r′, φ′) = exp [i (κjφ′ + Cj)] fk (r′), where the con-
stants Cj ∈ R set the local relative phases and only aﬀect
the Rabi term in Eq. (1). The Rabi energy density then
becomes

where δκi,κj is the Kronecker delta, Cij = Ci − Cj, and
r0 deﬁnes the small disk over which the local Rabi en-
ergy Eloc
R is averaged. In the case κ1 = κ2 = κ3, i.e.,
superposed same-sign vortices in all components or no
vortices at all, all three terms in the sum can be nonzero.
If we further assume f1 = f2 = f3, the minimiza-
tion of the above Rabi energy density implies maximiza-

tion of the function h (C12, C13) =PPi<j ωij cos Cij =
ω12 cos C12 +ω13 cos C13 +ω23 cos (C12 − C13). This func-
tion has an upper bound of PPi<j |ωij|. However, de-
pending on the values of ωij, maxCij h (C12, C13) may
be signiﬁcantly below this upper bound, indicating that
some or all of the Rabi couplings are suppressed by the
relative phase frustration between the particular compo-
nents.
In general, the upper bound can be reached if
and only if ω12ω13ω23 ≥ 0, which is never satisﬁed by
the parameter values used in this work (all the presented
states have ω12 < 0 < ω13 = ω23). For the parameter
set used in Fig. 7, the phase frustration occurs symmet-
rically between all three pairs at ω12 = −0.01ω (Fig. 1
shows an example of this type), for which the maximiza-
tion yields cos C12 = −0.5 and cos C13 = cos C23 = 0.5.
At ω12 = −0.09ω (Figs. 2–6), the optimal phases yield
cos C12 = −0.99 and cos C13 = cos C23 = 0.056, so that
maxCij h (C12, C13) = 0.091ω < 0.11ω = PPi<j |ωij|.
Hence, the Rabi couplings within pairs 1–3 and 2–3 are
strongly suppressed, whereas the coupling within pair 1–2

decrease of −E13 and −E′

sequence of the relative phase suppression between the

ues of σ show qualitatively similar behavior.

C. Domain walls in the relative phases

The Rabi coupling leads to well-deﬁned complex rel-
ative phases between the condensates, and therefore, to
the possibility of domain walls, i.e., one-dimensional de-
fects, in the relative phase ﬁeld [25]. The Rabi term
breaks the U(1) symmetry of the relative phases ϕij ≡
ϕi − ϕj, where ϕi = arg (Ψi) and i < j, by rendering
the value for which sgn (ωij) cos ϕij = 1 energetically fa-
vorable. This prompts us to deﬁne a domain wall to lie
along the path that connects two oppositely charged vor-
tices in ϕij (i.e., same-sign vortices in ϕi and ϕj ) and
satisﬁes cos ϕij = −sgn (ωij), i.e., maximizes the phase-
dependent part of the pairwise Rabi energy. Together,
the repulsive density–density coupling gij > 0 and the
Rabi coupling ωij give rise to an energy minimum at a
ﬁnite domain-wall length [22]. Increasing |ωij| decreases
this optimal length until the two vortices in ϕij merge
and the domain wall vanishes.

Let us now investigate the behavior of domain walls in
the states discussed in the preceding sections (Figs. 1–6
and 8–12). For convenience, we consider the three com-
ponents in pairs and their corresponding pairwise rela-
tive phases ϕ12, ϕ23 and ϕ13. The relative phases are
presented in panels (g)–(i) of said ﬁgures using the quan-
tities sgn (ωij) cos ϕij , with domain walls shown in black;
the positions of vortices of the relevant components are
also indicated.

The properties of the domain walls depend on the
strength of the Rabi coupling. For example, their char-
acteristic width (analogous to the core size of vortices) is
proportional to |ωij|−1/2 [25]. In Fig. 15, we show how
the domain walls change when ω12 is varied in the range
0.01ω ≤ −ω12 ≤ −0.12ω while the other parameters are
kept constant. At |ωij| = 0.01ω, the domain walls are
fairly delocalized, appearing wide between the oppositely
charged vortices in each ϕij [Fig. 15(a)]. Increasing |ωij|
to 0.03ω narrows the domain walls in ϕ12, while ϕ23 and
ϕ13 remain nearly unchanged [Fig. 15(b)].
In this re-
gion, the pairwise Rabi energies −E12, −E13 and −E23
all increase with increasing −ω12 as shown in Fig. 14. At
ω12 = −0.06ω, the strong Rabi coupling between com-
ponents 1 and 2 shrinks the domain walls in ϕ12, with
vortices in ϕ1 and ϕ2 almost coinciding [Fig. 15(d)]. Si-
multaneously, the Rabi energies −E13 and −E23 reach
their maximum and gradually start decreasing due to
the phase frustration occurring for these pairs [Fig. 14].

cos ϕ23. The rows correspond to diﬀerent values of ω12/ω:

Other parameters are ﬁxed at σ = 0.7, Ω/ω = 0.97, g = 2115,

11ar × 11ar, and the vortices in Ψ1, Ψ2, and Ψ3 are marked
with (blue) squares, (pink) dots, and (green) triangles, re-
spectively.

Finally, at ω12 = −0.12ω, the domain walls have van-
ished completely in ϕ12 [Fig. 15(e)]. Thus, we arrive at
a unique state in which the domain walls persist in ϕ23
and ϕ13 but vanish completely in ϕ12. The eﬀective in-
terlocking of components 1 and 2 with ϕ12 ≃ π implies
that ϕ13 ≡ ϕ23 + ϕ12 ≃ ϕ23 + π, as can be observed from
Figs. 15(d) and 15(e).

D. Vortex phases revisited

Equipped with the insight gained from the previous
two subsections, let us return to the phase diagrams in
Figs. 7 and 13, and the various skyrmionic lattice phases
therein. The skyrmionic lattices emerge from the com-
binations of the diverse set of single-component vortex
lattices appearing in the three-component system. One
can see that both phase diagrams exhibit a triangular-
to-square transition in the underlying vortex-lattice ge-
ometry, which is qualitatively similar to that of two-
component BECs. In order to understand how it comes
about in the three-component system, note that when
ω12 is large enough to overcome the density–density re-
pulsion due to g12 > 0 and dominate over the other Rabi
couplings, components 1 and 2 eﬀectively become locked
together such that Ψ1 = sgn (ω12) Ψ2 = −Ψ2. At the
same time, the Rabi coupling becomes very weak for the
pairs 1–3 and 2–3 because of the suppression eﬀect; in
fact, since we have ω13 = ω23, Ψ1 = −Ψ2 implies that
ε13 = −ε23, leading to cancellation of these Rabi cou-
plings from the energy functional. As a consequence, in
this phase-locked limit components 1 and 2 can be viewed
as a single component, and the system starts to behave
like a repulsive two-component system with only density–
density interactions. Then the triangular-to-square tran-
sition is expected in the overall lattice geometry, and the
ensuing ground states can be classiﬁed according to the
results of Refs. [14, 15]. Figure 2 presents an example
from the two-component-like regime with triangular lat-
tices (with σ = 0.7), while Fig. 4 shows a state with
square lattice geometry and components 1 and 2 nearly
locked together (σ = 0.9) and which, with a further in-
crease in |ω12|, would attain the square-geometry two-
component limit.
The states containing zig-zag vortex lattices in some
of the components (Figs. 8-10) emerged in the region
where all |ωij| where comparable with each other and
with the density–density repulsions. The zig-zag lattices
can be viewed as deformed triangular Abrikosov lattices
where vortices originally in a straight row have been dis-
placed in alternating directions.
In the state shown in
Fig. 8, with ˜Q = 2, these displacements are in opposite
directions in components 1 and 2 [Fig. 8(g)]. As ob-
served from Figs. 8(g)-(i), this vortex conﬁguration can
eﬃciently accommodate relatively tightly bound dimers
in all three components, which are energetically favoured
due to the interplay of the comparable density–density
repulsion and Rabi-mediated attraction. It also follows
from the zig-zag pattern that these dimers are arranged
in an antiferromagnetic order within each pair, maximiz-
ing the intracomponent vortex distances. The origin of
the phases illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10 (with ˜Q = 1 and
occurring in the range 0.4 < σ ≤ 0.8) can be under-
stood in a similar way but with the underlying lattice
geometry being square instead of triangular. This again
reﬂects the triangle-to-square transition discussed above.
We note that the zig-zag vortex patterns have previously

been found for single-component BECs in highly eccen-
tric harmonic trap potentials [43].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have shown that Rabi-coupled three-
component BECs can host unconventional vortex lattices
in the rotating ground state of the system. Based on the
unit cell of the total lattice pattern in each state, we
also interpreted and classiﬁed the states as skyrmionic
lattices. We argued that emerging lattice conﬁgurations
can no longer be classiﬁed only by the winding numbers
of three components, and that the average topological
index of the corresponding unit cell must be invoked.
Using the latter, we collected our results in two phase
diagrams in the plane of the intercomponent interaction
strength σ and Rabi frequency ω12. We found that at
certain combinations of signs and values of the Rabi fre-
quencies ωij, some of the pairwise Rabi energies become
heavily suppressed due to relative phase frustration. For
example, when ω12ω13ω23 < 0 and |ω12| ≫ |ω13| ≈ |ω23|,
the Rabi coupling is signiﬁcant only between compo-
nents 1 and 2. Such Rabi suppression results in an
eﬀective reduction of the three-component BEC to a
density–density-coupled two-component BEC. Similarly,
a three-component multiband superconductor, for which
the Josephson-type coupling serves as an analog of the
Rabi coupling in BECs, also reduces to a two-gap su-
perconductor at a particular choice of the coupling ma-
trix [31].

When the Rabi coupling becomes suppressed between
two pairs of components, the three-component system
exhibits the triangular-to-square vortex-lattice transition
in agreement with the previous results for the repul-
sively coupled two-component BECs and the classiﬁca-
tion given in Refs. [14, 15]. Although we have limited our
study to a particular subset of the large parameter space,
we expect the rotating ground state of the Rabi-coupled
three-component BEC to harbor many more unforeseen
vortex-lattice structures for other values of σ and the in-
tracomponent interaction strength g.

In light of the Rabi suppression, it might be interesting
to compare and contrast the present system with a hy-

brid three-component system in which two components
are diﬀerent spin states of the same atom coherently cou-
pled to each other, whereas the third component is a
diﬀerent species with diﬀerent atomic mass and coupled
only through density–density interactions to the other
two components. In the limit of strong Rabi coupling,
the hybrid system would reduce to a mass-imbalanced
two-component BEC, whose rotating ground state ex-
hibits a variety of unconventional ground-state vortex
structures [16, 21]. This more intricate limiting behavior
suggests that when the Rabi coupling is of intermediate
strength, rotation of the hybrid system will likely pro-
duce novel ground-state vortex lattices that do not exist
in our equal-mass system.

To realize the exotic vortex lattices experimentally, one
could use, e.g., 87Rb atoms in the hyperﬁne ground level
52S1/2. Two-component BECs have already been real-
ized using mixtures of the |F = 1, mF = −1i and |2, 1i
states [7], the |1, 1i and |2, 2i states [44], and the |2, 1i
and |2, 2i states [10] from this manifold. The Rabi-
coupled three component BEC could be created by opti-
cally trapping a mixture of any three of these states and
using microwave and radiofrequency radiation to coher-
ently couple them via two-photon processes. The vortex
lattices could then be produced by inducing rotation in
the system and letting it relax to its minimum-energy
state. Measurement of the relative phase between the
BEC components should also be feasible [45]. We also
note that many of the discovered phases could be distin-
guished by imaging only the proﬁle of the total density
ntot.
