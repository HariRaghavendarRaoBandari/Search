Magnetic properties of dirty multiband superconductors near the upper critical ﬁeld are studied.
The parameter κ2 characterizing magnetization slope is shown to have a signiﬁcant temperature
variation which is quite sensitive to the pairing interactions and relative strengths of intraband im-
purity scattering. In contrast to single-band superconductors the increase of κ2 at low temperatures
can be arbitrary large determined by the ratio of minimal and maximal diﬀusion coeﬃcients in
diﬀerent bands. Temperature dependencies of κ2(T ) in two-band MgB2 and iron-based supercon-
ductors are shown to be much more sensitive to the multiband eﬀects than the upper critical ﬁeld
Hc2(T ).

INTRODUCTION

Recently a number of multiband superconductors have
been discovered where the pairing of electrons is sup-
posed to take place simultaneously in several bands over-
lapping at the Fermi level1–8. One of the ﬁrst such su-
1 which has two distinct
perconductors found was MgB2
superconducting gaps residing on diﬀerent sheets of the
Fermi surface2,3,9. Up to date MgB2 has the highest
critical temperature Tc = 40 K among simple binary
compounds10. Later on multiband superconductivity has
been established in iron-pnictides6–8. There a strong in-
terband interaction mediated by antiferromagnetic exci-
tations has been suggested to play the dominant role in
pairing resulting in the peculiar s± symmetry of the or-
der parameter. The highest Tc among iron-pnictides is
above 100 K detected in atomically thin ﬁlms of FeSe11.
Besides their high Tc both the two-gap MgB2 and iron-
based superconductors have remarkable magnetic prop-
erties. The possibility of type-1.5 superconductivity has
been suggested to explain vortex clusterization detected
14. The observed unconven-
in MgB4
tional vortex patterns can result from a non-monotonic
vortex interaction generated by the interplay of multi-
ple superconducting coherence lengths in multicompo-
nent superconductors15–17.

12,13 and Sr2RuO4

In pulsed ﬁeld experiments the critical ﬁelds up to
60 T have been observed in iron pnictides18–23. Such
values of Hc2 are high enough to reach a paramagnetic
limit20,24–28 leading to the possibility of the Fulde-Ferrel-
Larkin-Ovchinnikov transition29. Comparably large up-
per critical ﬁelds were obtained by introducing disorder
in MgB2 thin ﬁlms where the record values of H⊥
c2 = 35T
(cid:107)
c2 = 51T were observed perpendicular and parallel
and H
to the crystal anisotropy ab plane respectively30.

The interplay of several pairing channels in multi-
band superconductors was predicted to produce convex-
shaped temperature dependencies of the upper criti-
cal ﬁeld29,31–33. Due to their anomalous shapes the
Hc2(T ) curves reach much larger values at T → 0

than was expected from a one-gap theory Hc2(0) =
0.69TcHc2(Tc)34,35. This explains an enormous enhance-
ment of the upper critical ﬁeld in MgB2 by non-magnetic
impurities36–38. Experiments measuring upper critical
30 and certain iron-based
ﬁelds in the disordered MgB2
superconductors18 are consistent with theoretical calcu-
lations using a two-gap model29,31,32. Therefore a convex
shape of Hc2(T ) dependence is considered as one of the
hallmarks of multiband pairing18,26,39–41 . However it
is not a universal feature of multiband superconductors
since concave Hc2(T ) curves were observed in MgB2 with-
out artiﬁcially introduced disorder10 as well as in many
iron-pnictide compounds21,22,27,42.

In order to ﬁnd a robust test for mutiband pairing it is
natural to look for an unusual behaviour of magnetization
at H < Hc2. In the vicinity of Hc2 magnetization Mz can
be characterized by the parameter κ2(T ) introduced by
Maki43

,

(1)

Mz =

where z-axis is directed along the magnetic ﬁeld, βL is
an Abrikosov parameter equal to 1.16 for a triangular
lattice44.
In single-band superconductors the parame-
ter κ2 has been studied extensively in the clean45 and
dirty limits46,47, for the arbitrary strength of impurity
scattering48,49 and taking into account strong electron-
phonon coupling eﬀects50. Dirty single-band supercon-
ductors were shown to have a universal behaviour char-
43,46,47 with
acterized by a slow monotonic increase of κ2
cooling from κ2(T = Tc) = κGL to κ2(T = 0) ≈ 1.2κGL,
where κGL is the Ginzburg-Landau parameter at T = Tc.
The theoretical calculations were found to be in good
agreement with experimentally measured κ2(T ) depen-
dencies in several superconducting alloys.51–53

The parameter κ2 is a basic quantity of type-II su-
perconductors determining their thermodynamic54 and
transport properties55,56 near Hc2. However the theory
calculating κ2 in multiband superconductors has been
lacking. In the present paper we demonstrate that this
parameter is much more sensitive to multiband eﬀects

than the upper critical ﬁeld. In MgB2 and iron pnictides
κ2(T ) dependencies are shown to reveal pronounced sig-
natures of multiband pairing in the regimes when Hc2(T )
curves deviate only slightly from the conventional single-
band behaviour. The κ2(T ) anomalies signal unconven-
tional thermodynamic and transport characteristics of
multiband superconductors.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In Sec.(II)
basic equations of the multiband Usadel theory are intro-
duced. General formulas describing the high-ﬁled mag-
netic response of dirty multiband superconductors are
derived in Sec.(III) including equations for the Hc2 in
Sec.(III A) and the magnetization in Sec.(III B). Several
examples of two-band superconductors are considered in
Sec.(IV). Results are discusses in Sec.(V) and conclusions
are given in Sec.(VI).

II. MULTIBAND USADEL THEORY.

We consider multiband superconductors in a dirty limit
using the Usadel theory31. Each k-th band is described in
terms of the quasiclassical Green’s function matrix ˆgk =
ˆgk(ε, r) which is deﬁned as follows

(cid:18) gk

(cid:19)

ˆgk =

−f +

k − gk

(2)

and subject to the normalization constraint ˆg2
matrix Usadel equation reads31,57

k = 1. The

Dk

ˆ∂r(ˆgk

ˆ∂r ˆgk) − [ωτ3 + ˆ∆k, ˆgk] = 0

(3)

where Dk is the diﬀusion constant, and ˆ∆k(r) =
|∆k|τ2e−iθkτ3 is the matrix gap function in k-th band.
In Eq.(3) the covariant diﬀerential superoperator is de-
ﬁned by ˆ∂rˆg = ∇ˆg− ieA [τ3, ˆg]. The 12 component of the
matrix Eq.(3) yields:

(gk ˆΠ2fk − fk∇2gk) = ∆kgk − iωfk

(4)

Dk

where ˆΠ = ∇ − 2ieA. Similar equation given by the 21
component of (3) yields f +(r, ω) = −f∗(r, ω). The gap
in each band is determined by self-consistency equations

where the partial conductivities are σk = 2e2νkDk and
νk are the densities of states per one spin projection.
The sum over frequencies in Eq.(6) converges therefore no
cutoﬀ is needed. The magnetization of a superconducting
sample M is determined by the current (6) according to
the usual relation ∇ × M = j.

III. MULTIBAND SUPERCONDUCTORS IN

LARGE MAGNETIC FIELDS.

A. The upper critical ﬁeld Hc2.

At large magnetic ﬁelds Hc2 − H (cid:28) Hc2 we can apply
approximations related to the smallness of the order pa-

rameter |∆k| ∝(cid:112)1 − H/Hc2. To calculate the structure

of a vortex lattice in a two-band superconductor let us
consider the linear integral-diﬀerential system consisting
of Usadel Eqs.(4) linearized with respect to the normal
state solution

ˆLωfk = i∆k; ˆLω =

0 − |ω|,
ˆΠ2

(7)

supplemented by the self-consistency relation (5). In a
linearised theory the magnetic ﬁled is not perturbed by
the vortex currents therefore we put B0 = Hc2z and
choose a Landau gauge in Eq.(7) A0 = Hc2xy. Then the
gradient term in Eq.(7) is ˆΠ0 = ∇ − 2ieA0. A periodic
vortex lattice is described by the Abrikosov solution of
Eqs.(7,5) which in general has the following form

∆k(r) = ∆bkΨ(r)

Ψ(r) =

CneinpyΨ0(x − nx0)

k = 1.

The solution of Eq. (7) yields

fk(r, ωn) =

∆k(r)

i(qk + |ωn|)

(10)

where qk = eHc2Dk. Substituting the ansatz (8,10) to
the self-consistency Eq.(5) we get the homogeneous linear
system ˆA(b1, ..bN )T = 0 for the order parameter ampli-
tudes where
ˆA = ˆΛ−1 − ˆI [G0 + ln(Tc/T ) + ψ(1/2) − ψ(1/2 + ˆρ)] .
(11)
Here ψ(x) is a di-gamma function and the diagonal ma-
trix ˆρ is given by (ˆρ)ij = δijqi/(2πT ). The solvability
condition det ˆA = 0 determines the upper critical ﬁeld
Hc2 of a dirty multiband superconductor.

the l.h.s. of a non-homogeneous Eq.(17) by ∆∗

where B1 = −δH + 4πMz and δH = Hc2 − H. The
relations (20,21) can be obtained by a straightforward
calculation while (22) is less trivial although it has been
used in the theory of single-band superconductors58. The
detailed derivation of Eq.(22) is shown in the Appendix
(A).
To simplify the further derivation let us consider from
the beginning a high-κ limit when σkDk (cid:28) 1.
In this
case we can neglect the magnetization in Eq.(22) to get

The derived amplitude ∆ is a basic parameter for cal-
culations of thermodynamic and transport properties of
superconductors near Hc2.
In particular using Eq.(15)
we obtain an expression for the space- averaged magne-

It is instructive to consider in more detail Eq.(11) in
two-band superconductors. In this case G0 = (Tr Λ −
λ0)/w where w = λ11λ22 − λ12λ21, λ0 =
λ2− + 4λ12λ21
and λ− = λ11 − λ22. The equation det ˆA = 0 can be
resolved in terms of the ln(T /Tc) yielding in general two
diﬀerent solutions
ln(T /Tc) = − (U1 + U2 + λ0/w)/2

(12)

+ [(U1 − U2 − λ−/w)2/4 + λ12λ21/w2]1/2

ln(T /Tc) = − (U1 + U2 + λ0/w)/2

(13)
− [(U1 − U2 − λ−/w)2/4 + λ12λ21/w2]1/2,
where Uk = ψ(1/2 + ρk) − ψ(1/2). Taking the limit
T → Tc one can see that the physical solutions are
(i) (12) in case when w ≡ detˆΛ > 0 and (ii) (13)
in case when w ≡ detˆΛ < 0 . While the case (i)
corresponds to the coupling parameters of MgB2
the case (ii) describes multiband superconductors with
interband-dominated pairing when λ12λ21 > λ11λ22 such
as iron-pnictide compounds6,8,18.

B. The magnetization slope dMz/dH.

Magnetic ﬁeld created by vortex currents (6) can be
found using the solution (8). Taking into account that

Close to the critical temperature κ2 reduces to the
Ginzburg-Landau parameter κ2(Tc) = κGL ≡ λL/ξ
where λL is the London penetration length and ξ =
1/
2eHc2 is the coherence length. Note that this def-
inition of coherence length is applicable only for dense
vortex lattices near Hc2. The physics of dilute vortex
conﬁgurations in multicomponent systems is regulated
by the interplay of multiple coherence lengths resulting
in non-monotonic vortex interactions15–17.

IV. EXAMPLES OF TWO-BAND

SUPERCONDUCTORS.

The general formalism developed in previous sections
can be applied to study magnetic properties of partic-
ular multiband compounds. To begin with we consider
a two-band model of MgB2 characterized by the cou-
pling parameters59 λ11 = 0.81, λ22 = 0.285, λ12 = 0.119,
λ21 = 0.09. Temperature dependencies of Hc2(T ) and
κ2(T ) are shown in Fig.(1) for diﬀerent values of (a)
D1/D2 = 1; 0.5; 0.25, (b) D1/D2 = 20, (c) D1/D2 =
0.05. For equal diﬀusion coeﬃcients D1/D2 = 1 the
single-band behaviours34,35,46 of Hc2 and κ2 are recov-
ered, see Fig.(1)a,b. As will be shown below this result
is valid for any number of bands and arbitrary pairing
matrix.
The disparity of diﬀusion coeﬃcients D1/D2 (cid:54)= 1 re-
sults in signiﬁcant variations of κ2. Comparing Figs.(1)a
and (1)b one can see that κ2(T ) is much more sensitive
to the ratio of duﬀusivities than the second critical ﬁeld.
The curvature variations of Hc2(T ) are noticeable only in
the limit D2 (cid:28) D1 as shown Fig.(1c). As demonstrated
in the Fig.(1e) the opposite limit D1 (cid:28) D2 yields ordi-
nary concave curves Hc2(T ) almost within the entire tem-
perature domain except of the small vicinity of Tc. On
the contrary temperature dependencies of κ2(T ) shown
for the same parameters in Fig.(1f) are drastically diﬀer-
ent from the single-band case. Of particular interest is a
sharp increase of κ2(T → 0) which is most pronounced
under the condition D2 (cid:28) D1 relevant to MgB2
31 [see
Fig.(1d)]. Physically thus means that the slope of mag-
netization curve becomes much less steep as shown in
the Fig.(3). The low-temperature increase of κ2 can be
considered as a feasible probe of the multiband pairing.
Next we consider two-band superconductors with pair-
ing from interband repulsion λii = 0 and λ12 = λ21 =
−0.5 resulting in the s± superconducting state6,8 . Such
a model has been used to describe an unconventional con-
vex behaviour of Hc2(T ) observed experimentally in iron-
based compounds.18 Here we suggest that an indepen-
dent and more sensitive test for the multiband physics in
iron pnictides can be implemented by measuring temper-
ature dependencies κ2(T ). As can be seen in Fig.(2b) κ2
demonstrate a sharp increase at low temperatures even
for not too small values of the ratio D1/D2 and deviate
strongly from the single-band behaviour shown by the
green down-most curve. For the same parameters Hc2(T )

D1/D2 = 1; 0.5; 0.25

In (a,b) solid, dashed and dash-dotted lines correspond to
D1/D2 = 1; 0.5; 0.25 respectively.
In (a) these curves

dependencies have only tiny deviations from the single-
band one shown by the green up-most line in Fig.(2a).

Summarizing the above examples one can see that
even a moderate disparity of diﬀusion constants when
D1/D2 ∼ 1 in two-band superconductors results in a
signiﬁcant increase of κ2(T ) at low temperatures as com-
pared to its value at the critical temperature κ2(Tc) =
κGL. In result the magnetization slope dMz/dH becomes
much less steep as compared to single-band superconduc-
tors. This behaviour is illustrated in Fig.(3 ) which shows
the slopes dMz/dH normalized to their values at Tc as
functions of temperature for diﬀerent values of D1/D2.

in the right columns of Figs.(1,2) κ2(T ) dependencies are
quite sensitive to variations of diﬀusivities even in the
range of parameters when Hc2(T ) curves look almost the
same as the single-band one.

To understand qualitative features of κ2(T ) in multi-
band superconductors it is instructive to consider sev-
eral characteristic cases. First let us recover single-band
results for Hc2 and κ2 assuming all diﬀusivities to be
equal Dk = D for k = 1...N .
In this case ρk = ρ
so that Eq.(11) reduces to ˆA = ˆΛ−1 − ˆI[G0 − U (ρ) −
ln(T /Tc)]. The solvability condition det ˆA = 0 yields
a single-band equation for the upper critical ﬁeld34,35
U (ρ) + ln(T /Tc) = 0. The corresponding eigen vector is
temperature independent and determined by the equa-
tion (ˆΛ−1 − ˆIG0)b = 0. Then taking into account that
κ2(Tc) = κGL from Eq.(27) we obtain the analytical ex-
GL = −π4ψ(cid:48)(cid:48)/[56ζ(3)ψ(cid:48)2] coinciding with
pression κ2
the single-band result46.

V. DISCUSSION.

The convex shape of Hc2(T ) curves is often considered
as a signature of multiband pairing18,39,41. However as
demonstrated by the above two-band examples the con-
ditions for having pronounced convexity such as shown in
Fig.(1c) are quite restrictive. If the disparity of diﬀusivi-
ties is not extreme D1/D2 ∼ 1 then deviations of Hc2(T )
from the conventional single-band theory are not signif-
icant. However even in this case it is possible to detect
signatures of multiband pairing in the magnetic response
measuring the magnetization slope at high ﬁelds. Shown

where we have used that ψ(cid:48)
and ψ(cid:48)

k = π2/2, ψ(cid:48)(cid:48)

k = −14ζ(3) at T = Tc.

k , ψ(cid:48)(cid:48)

k at T → 0

Eqs.(28,29) demonstrate that in the limit of a strong
disparity between diﬀusivities the value of κ2(Tc) is de-
termined by the maximal diﬀusivity while κ2(0) is deter-
mined by the minimal one. Therefore κGL = κ2(Tc) ∼
1/D1 and κ2(0) ∼ 1/D2 so that the low temperature
increase of κ2(0)/κGL ∼ D1/D2 (cid:29) 1 is determined by
the ratio of maximal and minimal diﬀusivities D1 =
max(Dk) and D2 = min(Dk) respectively.

Such a behaviour can be qualitatively understood as
follows. Near the critical temperature Eq. (11) reduces
to ˆA = ˆΛ−1 − ˆIG0 so that gap amplitudes bk are deter-
mined only by the coupling matrix. The magnetic ﬁeld
is small so that ρk (cid:28) 1 and its inﬂuence on the gap
amplitudes is negligible. However the contributions to
superconducting current and magnetization (6,15) from
each band are proportional to the corresponding diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcients. Hence in the limit of strong disparity
D1/D2 (cid:28) ((cid:29))1 the band with the largest diﬀusivity pro-
vides a dominant contribution to the magnetization near
Tc. On the other hand at low temperatures the magnetic
ﬁeld is large so that ρk (cid:29) 1 and therefore can eﬀectively
suppress superconducting correlations. From Eq.(10) one
can see that the anomalous function amplitude is smaller
in bands with larger diﬀusivities. Hence at T → 0 the
most signiﬁcant contribution to the magnetic response
and κ2 is determined by the band with the smallest dif-
fusivity.

Finally, the calculations presented in this paper con-
sider only the orbital depairing mechanism and neglect

tide compounds with large critical ﬁelds24–28. High val-
ues of Hc2 = φ0/(2πξ2) in these materials are deter-
mined by short coherence lengths ξ ∼ 1 − 3 nm29 which
are not consistent with the dirty limit approximation
considered here.
It is possible however to develop a
theory for κ2 in superconductors with arbitrary impu-
rity concentration48,49.
In single-band superconductors
κ2(T → 0) diverges in the clean limit but for experimen-
tally relevant ﬁnite impurity concentrations the changes
are not dramatic as compared to the dirty limit51. On
the other hand in the multiband case an interplay be-
tween diﬀerent Fermi velocities and impurity scattering
rates should result in a non-trivial modiﬁcations of κ2(T )
temperature dependencies.

VI. CONCLUSION

To conclude we have calculated the parameter κ2 char-
acterizing magnetization slopes dMz/dH in dirty multi-
band superconductors at high ﬁelds Hc2 − H (cid:28) Hc2.
The developed theory describes any number of supercon-
ducting bands and arbitrary set of pairing constants. We
have shown quite generally that in contrast to the dirty
single-band superconductors the temperature dependen-
cies of κ2(T ) have remarkable features which are highly
sensitive to the multiband eﬀects. The low-temperature
increase of κ2 as compared to its value at Tc is found
to be strongly pronounced even for the moderate dispar-
ity of diﬀusion coeﬃcients in diﬀerent bands. This eﬀect
should be particularity appealing for experimental identi-
ﬁcation since it could unambiguously conﬁrm unconven-
tional magnetic behaviour of multiband superconductors.
We have considered several examples of two-band mate-
rials like MgB2 and iron pnictides and demonstrated that
κ2 is much more sensitive than Hc2 to the ratio of diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcients in diﬀerent bands. The established rela-
tions between κ2 and gap function amplitudes provide a
basis to study thermodynamic and transport properties
of multiband superconductors in high magnetic ﬁelds.

Appendix A: Proof of the relation Eq.(22)

We use the relations ∇ = (∂+ + ∂−)/2 introducing
the operators ∂± = x∂x + y(∂y ± 2ieAy) so that ∂2± =
x + (∂y ± 2ieAy)2. The gap functions satisfy
∂2

Due to the relations

we get

∂x∆ = i(∂y − 2ieAy)∆
∂x∆∗ = −i(∂y + 2ieAy)∆∗

(∂−∆)2 = 0; (∂+∆∗)2 = 0

Then the average is given by
4(cid:104)|∆|2∇2|∆|2(cid:105) = (cid:104)|∆|2(∂2

+ + ∂2− + 2∂+∂−)|∆|2(cid:105).

Let us consider the three terms in separate

(i)(cid:104)|∆|2∂2

(cid:104)|∆|2(cid:0)∆∗∂2

+|∆|2(cid:105) =

+∆ + ∆∂2

(ii)(cid:104)|∆|2∂2−|∆|2(cid:105) =

(cid:104)|∆|2(cid:0)∆∗∂2−∆ + ∆∂2−∆∗ + 2∂−∆∂−∆∗(cid:1)(cid:105) =

− 2eHc2(cid:104)|∆|4(cid:105) + (cid:104)|∆|2∆∂2−∆∗(cid:105) + 2(cid:104)|∆|2∂−∆∂−∆∗(cid:105)

(A7)

(iii) − 2(cid:104)|∆|2∂+∂−|∆|2(cid:105) =

(A8)

(cid:104)(∂+|∆|2)2(cid:105)(cid:105) + (cid:104)(∂−|∆|2)2(cid:105) =
(cid:104)(∂+∆)2∆∗2(cid:105) + (cid:104)(∂+∆∗)2∆2(cid:105) + 2(cid:104)|∆|2(∂+∆)(∂+∆∗)(cid:105)+
(cid:104)(∂−∆)2∆∗2(cid:105) + (cid:104)(∂−∆∗)2∆2(cid:105) + 2(cid:104)|∆|2(∂−∆)(∂−∆∗)(cid:105) =
(cid:104)(∂+∆)2∆∗2(cid:105) + 2(cid:104)|∆|2(∂+∆)(∂+∆∗)(cid:105)+
(cid:104)(∂−∆∗)2∆2(cid:105) + 2(cid:104)|∆|2(∂−∆)(∂−∆∗)(cid:105)

where we took into account the Eqs.(A5). Collecting all
terms we get
4(cid:104)|∆|2∇2|∆|2(cid:105) = −4eHc2(cid:104)|∆|4(cid:105)+
(cid:104)∆∗2[∆∂2

(A9)
+∆ − (∂+∆)2](cid:105) + (cid:104)∆2[∆∗∂2−∆∗ − (∂−∆∗)2](cid:105)

The last two terms here can be transformed in a similar
way as follows

+∆ − (∂+∆)2 =

∆∂2
∆∂2−∆ − (∂−∆)2 = −4eHc2∆2
∆∗∂2−∆∗ − (∂−∆∗)2 =
∆∗∂2

+∆∗ − (∂+∆∗)2 = −4eHc2∆∗2

(A10)

(A11)

so that ﬁnally we get

(cid:104)|∆|2∇2|∆|2(cid:105) = −2eHc2(cid:104)|∆|4(cid:105)

+∆∗ = −2eHc2∆∗
∂2
∂2−∆ = −2eHc2∆

(A1)

(A2)

which proves the Eq.(22).
