(Dated: March 4, 2016)

Based on the formula of shortcuts to adiabaticity, we solve the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equa-
tion in various nonlinear quantum systems. For a given time-dependent adiabatic Hamiltonian,
the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian is obtained by solving the equation for the dynamical invariant.
We show that the equation is equivalent to the Lax equation in nonlinear integrable systems. This
identiﬁcation allows us to obtain the counterdiabatic term exactly. Multi-soliton potentials obtained
from the Korteweg-de Vries equation and a XY spin chain with the use of the Toda equations are
studied in detail. The present method also oﬀers a way to obtain isospectral Hamiltonians.

Introduction.– Ideal control of quantum systems has
attracted interests recently both from theoretical and
practical points of view. The rapid advances of tech-
nology make us possible to manipulate quantum systems
in a precise way and designing the optimal Hamiltonian
is a realistic important problem. The meaning of the op-
timality is not so obvious and various methods have been
proposed theoretically in diﬀerent settings. The counter-
diabatic driving, known as “shortcuts to adiabaticity”,
is one of such methods and we can realize the adiabatic
change of states in a ﬁnite duration [1–5]. This method
was realized in several experiments [6–9] and is expected
be applied to the adiabatic quantum computation called
quantum annealing [10].

Although the formulation of the method is general,
the explicit constructions of the counterdiabatic Hamil-
tonian are restricted to simple systems such as two- and
three-level systems [3, 11], harmonic oscillator [12], and
scale-invariant systems [13].
In this letter, we propose
a new method to construct the counterdiabatic Hamil-
tonian which is applied to nonlinear integrable systems
such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) solitons [14] and
Toda lattices [15]. In nonlinear systems, a quantum me-
chanical point of view is utilized to solve the equations
of motion. We ﬁnd that the method developed there is
directly applied to the quantum adiabatic dynamics. It is
applied not only to a speciﬁc system but also to a broad
class of integrable systems including many-body systems.
Counterdiabatic driving and dynamical invariant.– In
the counterdiabatic driving, we treat the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation

i

∂

∂t|ψ(t)i = (cid:16) ˆHad(t) + ˆHcd(t)(cid:17) |ψ(t)i.

(1)

|ψ(t)i is an adiabatic state of ˆHad(t), which means that
|ψ(t)i is written in terms of the instantaneous eigenstates
of ˆHad(t). To prevent the nonadiabatic transitions, we
need an additional counterdiabatic term ˆHcd(t). The
spectral representation of this term is given by [1–3]

ˆHcd(t) = iXn

(1 − |n(t)ihn(t)|)

∂|n(t)i

∂t

(2)

where {|n(t)i} are the eigenstates of ˆHad(t).
Lewis-Riesenfeld dynamical invariant ˆF (t) satisfying

The counterdiabatic driving is characterized by the

∂ ˆF (t)

∂t

i

= [ ˆHad(t) + ˆHcd(t), ˆF (t)] = [ ˆHcd(t), ˆF (t)]. (3)

It is shown that the eigenvalues of ˆF (t) are indepen-
dent of t and the solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation
are given by adiabatic states of ˆF (t) [16]. This means
that the invariant ˆF (t) commutes with ˆHad(t).
ˆHcd(t)
is written by using the eigenstates of ˆF (t) as Eq. (2).
We can reformulate the problem by using Eq. (3) instead
of using Eq. (2) [4]. Furthermore, the optimality of the
counterdiabatic driving is shown by using the method
called quantum brachistochrone [17, 18]. The optimality
is characterized by the invariant which is constructed for
given constraints of the Hamiltonian. Thus, ﬁnding the
invariant is the key to design the optimal Hamiltonian.

In the present study, we treat a class of systems such
that the adiabatic Hamiltonian is equal to the invari-
ant. The counterdiabatic term is obtained by solving
Eq. (3) with ˆF (t) = ˆHad(t). In this case, the eigenval-
ues of ˆHad(t) are time independent. For a given ˆHad(t),
ˆHcd(t) is expressed by a linear combination of operators
deﬁned in the corresponding Hilbert space and the time
dependence of the coeﬃcients are obtained by solving the
equation. The series is generally inﬁnite and solving the
equation is a formidable task. However, in integrable
systems that we shall discuss in this letter, the counter-
diabatic term is expressed in a compact form.

Lax form for KdV equation.– First, we study one-
in a time-dependent potential

dimensional
u(x, t). The adiabatic Hamiltonian is given by

systems

ˆHad(t) = ˆp2 + u(ˆx, t).

(4)

We consider the case that u(x, t) satisﬁes the KdV equa-
tion [14]

∂u(x, t)

∂t − 6u(x, t)

∂u(x, t)

∂x

+

∂3u(x, t)

∂x3 = 0.

(5)

The KdV equation is a typical nonlinear integrable sys-
tem and has multi-soliton solutions [19]. The integrabil-
ity is represented by the Lax equation

∂L(t)

∂t

= [M (t), L(t)],

(6)

where the set of operators (L(t), M (t)) is called the Lax
pair [20] . The Lax equation is equivalent to the equation
for the dynamical invariant (3). The eigenvalues of L(t)
are independent of t. Then, M (t) is deﬁned by

∂
∂t

ψ(t) = M (t)ψ(t),

(7)

where ψ(t) is an eigenfunction of L(t). In the case of the
KdV equation, the Lax pair is known to have the form

L(t) = −

M (t) = −4

∂x2 + u(x, t),
∂
∂x

∂3
∂x3 + 3

u(x, t) + 3u(x, t)

(8)

(9)

∂
∂x

.

As we see from the comparison between the Lax form
and the dynamical invariant, L(t) and M (t) correspond
to the adiabatic Hamiltonian (4) and the counterdiabatic
term

ˆHcd(t) = −4ˆp3 − 3 (ˆpu(ˆx, t) + u(ˆx, t)ˆp) ,

(10)

respectively. This form is applied to any solutions of
the KdV equation.
In integrable systems, there exist
inﬁnite conserved quantities, which corresponds to the
property that the eigenvalues of the dynamical invariant
are independent of t.

Deformation of the counterdiabatic term.– Although
we have obtained the exact form of the counterdiabatic
term, it contains a cubic term in ˆp and is not convenient
for our purpose of quantum control. This drawback is cir-
cumvented by using the gauge transformation and state-
dependent deformation [21–23]. We demonstrate this by
treating the single- and double-soliton potentials.

The single-soliton solution of the KdV equation is
given by u(x, t) = −2κ2/ cosh(κx − 4κ3t) where κ is a
real positive parameter. The adiabatic Hamiltonian (4)
with this hyperbolic Scarf potential has a single bound
state, whose eigenenergy is given by E0 = −κ2. To de-
form the counterdiabatic term, we rewrite Eq. (10) as

ˆHcd(t) = −4(ˆp + iW (ˆx, t))ˆp(ˆp − iW (ˆx, t))
− (ˆp˜u(ˆx, t) + ˜u(ˆx, t)ˆp) − 4E0 ˆp,

(11)
where W (x, t) = κ tanh(κx − 4κ3t) and ˜u(x, t) =
W 2(x, t) + ∂xW (x, t) + E0. The adiabatic Hamiltonian
in the present case has the supersymmetry and the po-
tential is written by using the superpotential W (x, t) as
u(x, t) = W 2(x, t) − ∂xW (x, t) + E0 [24, 25]. The su-
persymmetry also tells us that the ground-state eigen-
function ψ(x, t) satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation (−i∂x−
iW (x, t))ψ(x, t) = 0. This means that the ﬁrst term in

2

Eq. (11) is neglected if we only treat the ground state.
Furthermore, the superpartner potential ˜u(x, t) goes to
zero in the present case. Thus, we arrive at the simple
form of the counterdiabatic term: ˆHcd(t) = −4E0 ˆp =
4κ2 ˆp. This form can be derived from the formula for the
scale-invariant systems [13]. In the single-soliton poten-
tial, the system has translational symmetry and we can
directly obtain this simple form.

In the case of multi-soliton potentials, the formula for
the scale-invariant systems cannot be applied and our
method becomes useful. The double-soliton potential is
represented as

u(x, t) = −2

∂2

∂x2 ln(cid:20)1 + A1e2η1 + A2e2η2
κ1 + κ2(cid:19)2
A1A2e2(η1+η2)(cid:21),
+(cid:18) κ1 − κ2

(12)

where κ1, κ2, A1, and A2 are real positive parameters
and ηi = κix − 4κ3
i t with i = 1, 2. This system has two
bound states. When κ1 > κ2, the ground-state energy is
1 and the ﬁrst excited-state energy is E1 = −κ2
E0 = −κ2
2.
The ground state is localized to the deeper well and the
ﬁrst excited state is to the other well. In the present case,
the superpotential is written as [26]

∂
∂x

W (x, t) = −κ1 +
ln

(13)

The ground state is obtained from the superpotential and
the ﬁrst excited state is obtained from the ground state
of the superpartner system.

It is also possible to consider the deformation of the
counterdiabatic term (10). Since we have the supersym-
metry, we can use Eq. (11). When we consider the ground
state, the ﬁrst term of Eq. (11) is neglected. The remain-
ing terms cannot be neglected and we have the counter-
diabatic term linear in ˆp. The system is controlled by the
scalar and vector potentials. If we want to control the
system by the scalar potential, we can perform the gauge
transformation. To control the ground state, instead of
using Eq. (10), we can use the counterdiabatic potential

2)˜u(x, t),

1 − κ2

Vcd(x, t) = −˜u2(x, t) + 4(κ2

(14)
2/ cosh2(η2 + δ2) with δ2 =
where ˜u(x, t) = −2κ2
ln [A2(κ1 − κ2)/(κ1 + κ2)] /2. The deformation for the
excited states can be done in a similar way.
We plot the potential and the ground-state wavefunc-
tion in Fig. 1. The counterdiabatic potential makes a
deep well around the shallower well in the original po-
tential and moves so that the moving state, trapped in
the deep well of the original potential, is not disturbed
by the shallow well.

of the wavefunction ψ0(x, t) without the counterdiabatic po-
tential Vcd(x, t) calculated numerically. The solid line in the
lower right panel represents the overlap between the states
with and without the counterdiabatic term |hψ0(t)|ψ(t)i|. We
take A1 = A2 = 3.0, κ1 = 1.2, and κ2 = 1.0.

the double solitons. Plotted are Jn(t) (red lines with +),

The Toda equations are derived in classical lattice sys-
tems with the exponential interaction and have multi-
soliton solutions [15, 31]. The Lax form is written in a
matrix representation, which describes a one-dimensional
lattice system with a nearest neighbor hopping ampli-
tude. We can exploit this result in our spin chain system.
Furthermore, the Hamiltonian is mapped onto a non-
interacting fermion system by using the Jordan-Wigner
transformation [27, 28]. Our Hamiltonian is written as

Spin chain and Toda lattice.– In the second example,
we study the one-dimensional isotropic XY spin model.

We note that the coupling functions {Jn(t)} and {hn(t)}
are site- and time-dependent. To ﬁnd the counterdia-
batic Hamiltonian, we need to solve Eq. (3) with ˆF (t) =
ˆHad(t). For a uniform system with site-independent cou-
plings, the energy eigenvalues and eigenstates of ˆHad(t)
are obtained exactly by using the Jordan-Wigner trans-
In that case, we can ﬁnd ˆHcd(t)
formation [27, 28].
by using Eq. (2). The problem is that ˆHcd(t) has
a noncompact form including many-body interaction
terms [29, 30]. We circumvent this diﬃculty by using
integrability of Toda lattice [15]. We set

The counterdiabatic term incorporates the two-body
interaction term. We note that it is possible to consider
the unitary transformation ˆH ′(t) = ˆU ˆH(t) ˆU † such that
the total Hamiltonian takes the original form as

ˆH ′(t) =

panels show states in the single spin-ﬂip sector and the lower

single soliton and the right ones are for a double soliton.

where z1 = e−κ1 and c1(t) = c1(0)et sinh κ1 with positive
κ1. Jn(t) and hn(t) have a single peak around κ1n ∼
t sinh κ1. The wavefunction is localized around the peak
of the coupling functions. We plot the single- and double-
soliton solutions in Fig 2.

To know how the eigenstates are controlled by the soli-
ton Hamiltonians, it is important to notice that Eqs. (15)
and (16) commute with the total magnetization in z di-
rection: ˆM = Pn σz
n. In the single spin-ﬂip sectors with
M = ±(N − 2), the matrix representation of the Hamil-
tonian is the same as that of the Lax pair for the Toda
lattice. In fact, Eq. (16) is inferred from this correspon-
dence. There exist continuum “scattering” states and
discrete “bound” states. The bound-state eigenfunction
is trapped in one of the solitons and is plotted in Fig. 2.
In the double spin-ﬂip sectors with M = ±(N − 4), the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for a single soliton are cal-
culated numerically and are plotted in Fig. 3. These
results show that the ﬂipped spin is transferred by the
solitons as Fig. 4. We ﬁnd that, to transfer ﬂipped spins
eﬃciently, we need not only to apply the magnetic ﬁelds
hn(t) but also to change the interactions Jn(t) from the
uniform value.

Other systems.– We have proposed the counterdiabatic
driving for nonlinear integrable systems. The Lax form is
known for various systems other than the KdV and Toda
systems. For example, the higher order KdV equations
are also integrable. For the potential u(x, t) satisfying
ut − 10(uxxxu + 2uxxux) + 30u2ux + uxxxxx = 0, where
the subscript denotes the diﬀerentiation in terms of the
variable, the counterdiabatic term is given by Hcd(t) =
−16p5 + 20(p3u + up3) − 30upu− 5(puxx + uxxp). Other
possible applications are the modiﬁed KdV equation, the
sine-Gordon equation, the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equa-
tion, the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur formalism [34],
and so on. We stress that the nonlinear integrable sys-
tems using the Lax formalism are known inﬁnitely and
one can ﬁnd the corresponding counterdiabatic driving
in each system. Several applications of such systems will
be reported elsewhere.

tions in the double spin-ﬂip sector for a single soliton. The
continuum states give an energy band with the width 4 in the

band with the width 2 and one of the eigenfunctions denoted
by blue crosses is localized in speciﬁc states. We take κ1 = 2

(J1(∞), J2(∞)) = (0, 0), and (h1(∞), h2(∞), h3(∞)) =
(v, 0,−v). These limiting values show that the Hamilto-
nian of the XY model can be continuously deformed to
the noninteracting Hamiltonian with the same eigenval-
ues by using the time evolution of the Toda equations.
This result is generalized to arbitrary numbers of spins
N [32]. We note that the continuous change is possible
for the isotropic XY model and not for anisotropic mod-
els including the Ising model, which is considered to be
related to the universal adiabatic computing property of
the XY Hamiltonian [33].

In inﬁnite systems, the boundary eﬀect is neglected
and the soliton solutions are obtained by using the inverse
scattering method [31]. For example, the simplest single-
soliton solution is given by
