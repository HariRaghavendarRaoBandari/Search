SYMMETRIC POWERS OF SEVERI-BRAUER VARIETIES

J ´ANOS KOLL ´AR

Abstract. We classify products of symmetric powers of a Severi-Brauer va-
riety, up-to stable birational equivalence. The description also includes Grass-
mannians and moduli spaces of genus 0 stable maps.

There are several ways to associate other varieties to a Severi-Brauer variety P

deﬁned over a ﬁeld k. These include

• the Grassmannians Grass(Pm−1, P ),
• the symmetric powers Symm(P ) and
• the moduli spaces ¯M0(P, d) of genus 0 stable maps of degree d to P .

While all these varieties are geometrically rational, they are usually not rational
over the ground ﬁeld and it is an interesting problem to understand their birational
properties over k. The results of this note are partly weaker—since we describe
only the stable birational equivalence classes—but partly stronger—since we also
describe the products of these varieties.

Thus let MSym(P ) denote the multiplicative monoid generated by stable bira-
tional equivalence classes of Grassmannians of P , symmetric powers of P and the
moduli spaces ¯M0(P, d). We show that MSym(P ) is ﬁnite, identify its elements and
also the multiplication rules.

Birational equivalence of two varieties is denoted by X bir∼ Y and stable birational
equivalence by X stab∼ Y . See Paragraph 2 for the deﬁnition and basic properties of
Severi-Brauer varieties.

Theorem 1. Let P be a Severi-Brauer variety of index i = i(P ). Then

(1) MSym(P ) = {Grass(Pd−1, P ) : d | i(P )} and products are given by
(2) Grass(Pd−1, P ) × Grass(Pe−1, P ) stab∼ Grass(P(d,e)−1, P ), where (d, e) de-
notes the greatest common divisor. The identity is Grass(Pi−1, P ) stab∼ P0.

The class of an arbitrary Grassmannian is given by the rule

(3) Grass(Pd−1, P )

stab∼ Grass(P(d,i)−1, P ).

The class of an arbitrary symmetric power is given by the rules

(4) Symd(P ) stab∼ Sym(d,i)(P ) for every d ≥ 0,
(5) Symd(P ) bir∼ Grass(Pd−1, P ) × Pd(d−1) for d ≤ n + 1 and
(6) Symd(P ) × Syme(P ) stab∼ Sym(d,e)(P ).

The class of ¯M0(P, d) is determined by the parity of d:
(7) ¯M0(P, 2e) stab∼ P save when dim P = e = 1 and
(8) ¯M0(P, 2e+1) stab∼ Grass(P1, P ). Note that Grass(P1, P ) is rational iﬀ i(P ) ∈

{1, 2} and stably birational to P iﬀ i(P ) is odd.

The most natural description seems to be in terms of symmetric powers, so we
start with them. The relationship with Grassmannians is easy to establish. The

1

moduli spaces ¯M0(P, d) end up birationally the simplest but understanding them
is more subtle.

The case dim P = e = 1 is exceptional in (1.7). ¯M0(P, 2) aims to classify double
covers of P ramiﬁed at 2 points. The coarse moduli space is Sym2(P ) ∼= P2.
However, if P ≇ P1 then there are no such double covers deﬁned over k. The
problem is that every double cover has an order 2 automorphism.
In all other
cases, a dense open subset of ¯M0(P, d) parametrizes maps without automorphisms,
even embeddings if dim P ≥ 3.

2 (Severi-Brauer varieties I). Let k be a ﬁeld with separable closure ks. A k-scheme
P is called a Severi-Brauer variety if Pks := P ×Spec k Spec ks ∼= Pn for some n.
We say that P is trivial if P ∼= Pn. The index of P is the gcd of all 0-cycles on
P ; it is denoted by i(P ). A subscheme L ⊂ P is called twisted linear if Lks is a
linear subspace of Pks ∼= Pn. Thus L is also a Severi-Brauer variety. For a reduced
subscheme Y ⊂ X let hY i denote the minimal twisted linear subvariety containing
Y . Thus hY iks is the linear span of Yks .

The following basic results go back to Severi and Chˆatelet, see [GS06, Chap.5]

for a modern treatment and references.

(1) P is trivial iﬀ P (k) 6= ∅.
(2) i(P ) divides dim P + 1,
(3) P has a 0-cycle Z of degree i(P ) and dimhZi = i(P ) − 1.
(4) The minimal twisted linear subvarieties have dimension i(P ) − 1 and they

are isomorphic to each other; call this isomorphism class P min.

(5) Given P min and r ≥ 1 there is a unique (up-to isomorphism) Severi-Brauer

variety Pr of dimension r(dim P min + 1) − 1 such that (Pr)min ∼= P min.

bir∼ P min × Pm for m = (r − 1)(dim P min + 1).

(6) Pr
(7) Two Severi-Brauer varieties P1, P2 are Brauer-equivalent, denoted by P1 ∼
. This holds iﬀ the smaller dimensional one is isomorphic

P2, iﬀ P min
to a twisted linear subvariety of the other.

A key step in understanding symmetric powers is the following.

1. Symmetric powers

Theorem 3. [KS04] Let P be a Severi-Brauer variety of dimension n. Then
Symn+1(P ) is rational.

The following is a short geometric proof. The Euler number of Pn is n + 1,
thus a general section of the tangent bundle TPn vanishes at n + 1 points. For any
Severi-Brauer variety this gives a dominant map π : H 0(P, TP ) 99K Symn+1(P ).

Let Z ⊂ P be a reduced 0-cycle of degree n + 1. Then π−1(Z) is the linear
space H 0(cid:0)P, TP (−Z)(cid:1) ⊂ H 0(P, TP ) of dimension n + 1. Let V ⊂ H 0(P, TP ) be a
general aﬃne-linear subspace of codimension n + 1. Then π|V : V 99K Symn+1(P )
is birational.
(cid:3)

Corollary 4. Let P be a Severi-Brauer variety of index i(P ). Then Symd(P ) is
stably rational iﬀ i(P ) | d.

Proof. If d is not divisible by i(P ) then Symd(P )(k) = ∅, hence Symd(P ) is not

stably rational.

SYMMETRIC POWERS OF SEVERI-BRAUER VARIETIES

To see the converse, assume that i(P ) | d. By (2.5–6) P is stably birational to a
Severi-Brauer variety P ′ of dimension d − 1. Furthermore, Symd(P ′) is rational by
Theorem 3 and it is stably birational to Symd(P ) by Corollary 8.
(cid:3)

5 (Proof of Theorem 1.1–6). The easiest is (1.5). Given d points in general position,
they span a linear subspace of dimension d − 1. This gives a natural map π :
Symd(P ) 99K Grass(Pd−1, P ). Let K be the function ﬁeld of Grass(Pd−1, P ) and
LK ⊂ PK the linear subspace corresponding to the generic point. Thus LK is a
Severi-Brauer subvariety of dimension d − 1. The generic ﬁber of π is Symd(LK)
which is rational by Theorem 3. Thus Symd(P ) bir∼ Grass(Pd−1, P ) × Pd(d−1).

Next we show (1.6) using the stable birational equivalences

Symd(P ) × Syme(P ) × Pn(d,e)

stab∼ Symd(P ) × Syme(P ) × Sym(d,e)(P )
stab∼ Pnd × Pne × Sym(d,e)(P ).

First let K be the function ﬁeld of Symd(P ) × Syme(P ). Then PK has 0-cycles of
degrees d and e, thus is also has a 0-cycle of degree (d, e). Thus Sym(d,e)(PK ) is
stably rational by Corollary 4, proving the ﬁrst part.

Similarly,

let L be the function ﬁeld of Sym(d,e)(P ). Then Symd(PL) and

Syme(PL) are stably rational by Lemma 4, proving the second part.

Using this for e = i(P ) gives that

Symd(P ) × Symi(P ) stab∼ Sym(d,i)(P ).

Since Symi(P ) is stably rational by Corollary 4, we (1.4). Together with (1.5) this
implies (1.2).

We have proved that every class in MSym(P ) is stably birational to a symmetric
power Symd(P ) for some d | i(P ). Next we show that these Symd(P ) are not stably
birational to each other.

Let d < e be diﬀerent divisors of i(P ). There is thus a prime p such that
d = pad′, e = pce′ where a < c and d′, e′ are not divisible by p. Let pb be the largest
p-power dividing i(P ).

By assumption P has a k′ point for some ﬁeld extension k′/k of degree i(P ).
Let k′′/k be the Galois closure of k′/k and K the invariant subﬁeld of a p-Sylow
subgroup of Gal(k′′/k). Set K ′ = k′K. Note that p does not divide deg(K/k) and
deg(K ′/K) = pb, hence i(PK) = pb.

Although K ′/K need not be Galois, the Galois group of its Galois closure is a
p-group, hence nilpotent. Thus there is a subextension K ′ ⊃ L ⊃ K of degree pb−a.
It is enough to show that Symd(PL) and Syme(PL) are not stably birational over
L. By (1.4),

Symd(PL)

stab∼ Sympa

(PL)

and

Syme(PL)

stab∼ Sympc

(PL).

(PL) is stably rational by Corollary 4. By contrast Sympc

Note that PL has a point in K ′ and deg(K ′/L) = pa, hence i(PL) = pa and so
Sympa
(PL) does not have
any L-points. Indeed, an L-point on Sympc
(PL) would mean a 0-cycle of degree pc
on PL hence a 0-cycle of degree pb−apc = pb−a+c on PK. This is impossible since
i(PK) = pb and b − a + c < b. Thus Sympa
(PL) are not stably
birational.
(cid:3)

(PL) and Sympc

Remark 6. It is possible that the stable birational equivalences in Theorem 1 can
be replaced by birational equivalences. For instance, it is possible that

Symd(P ) bir∼ Grass(P(d,i)−1, P ) × Pm for suitable m.

However, several steps in the proof naturally give only stable birational equivalences
and the diﬀerence between stable birational equivalence and birational equivalence
is not even understood for Severi-Brauer varieties.

We have used some general results on symmetric powers.

Lemma 7. Let U be a positive dimensional, geometrically irreducible k-variety.
Then

Symm(U × Pr) bir∼ Symm(U ) × Prm.

Proof. There is a natural projection map Symm(U × Pr) → Symm(U ). We claim

that its generic ﬁber Fgen is rational. To construct it, set

L := k(cid:0)Symm(U )(cid:1)

and K := k(cid:0)Symm−1(U ) × U(cid:1).

Here we think of Symm(U ) as U m/Sm and Symm−1(U ) × U as U m/Sm−1 where
Sm−1 ⊂ Sm are the permutations that ﬁx the last factor. Thus K/L is a degree
bir∼ ℜK/L(Pr), the Weil restriction of Pr from K to L.
m ﬁeld extension and Fgen
Thus Fgen is rational.

(cid:3)

Corollary 8. Let U, V be positive dimensional, geometrically irreducible k-varieties.
If U stab∼ V then Symm(U ) stab∼ Symm(V ) for every m.

(cid:3)

As a consequence we see that Symm(Pr) is stably rational. In fact it is rational;

see [Mat68] for a very short proof.

2. Moduli of Severi-Brauer subvarieties

We need some results on twisted line bundles and maps between Severi-Brauer

varieties.

Deﬁnition 9 (Twisted line bundles). Let X be a geometrically normal, proper
k-variety. A twisted line bundle of X is a line bundle L on Xks such that Lσ ∼= L
for every σ ∈ Gal(ks/k). Equivalently, its class [L] is a k-point of Pic(X). For
example, if P is a Severi-Brauer variety then OP (r) is a twisted line bundle for
every r.

Let |L| denote the irreducible component of the Hilbert scheme (or Chow variety)
of X parametrizing subschemes H ⊂ X such that Hks is in the linear system
|Lks|. (See [Kol96, Chap.I.] for the Hilbert scheme or the Chow variety.) This is
clearly a Severi-Brauer variety. There is a natural map ιL : X 99K |L|∨ given by
x 7→ {H : H ∋ x}.

Using this we deﬁne the dual of a Severi-Brauer variety P as P ∨ := |OP (1)|.
Let φ : X 99K Y be a map between geometrically normal, proper varieties and
LY a twisted line bundle on Y . Assume that either φ is a morphism or X is smooth.
Then φ∗LY is a twisted line bundle on X and |φ∗LY | ∼ |LY |.

Let X, Y be geometrically normal, proper varieties and LX, LY twisted line
bundles on them. Let Map(cid:0)(X, LX), (Y, LY )(cid:1) denote the moduli space of all maps
φ : X 99K Y such that φ∗LY ∼= LX .

SYMMETRIC POWERS OF SEVERI-BRAUER VARIETIES

5

If P, Q are Severi-Brauer varieties then we write

Mapd(Q, P ) := Map(cid:0)(Q, OQ(d)), (P, OP (1))(cid:1).

Composing with ιL gives an isomorphism

Map(cid:0)(X, L), (P, OP (1))(cid:1) ∼= Map1(cid:0)|L|∨, P (cid:1).

10 (Severi-Brauer varieties II). Let P, Q be Severi-Brauer varieties.

(1) Their product is deﬁned as |OP ∨×Q∨ (1, 1)| ∼= |OP ×Q(1, 1)|∨. I denote this
by P ⊗ Q. It is better to think of this as deﬁned on Brauer-equivalence
classes. This makes the set of Brauer-equivalence classes into a group with
identity P0 ∼ Pm and inverse P ∨. The group is torsion, more precisely
P ⊗i(P ) ∼ P0. (Frequently a smaller power of P is trivial, the smallest such
exponent is the period.)

The group deﬁned above is isomorphic to the Brauer group of k. (We

will not use its cohomological description; see [GS06].)

(2) Map1(Q, P ) ∼ Q∨ ⊗ P . The natural map is φ 7→ {(x, H) : φ(x) ∈ H} ∈

|OQ×P ∨ (1, 1)|.

(3) If |L| is non-empty then |Lm| ∼ |L|⊗m; this comes from identifying the
symmetric power of a vector space V with the subspace of symmetric tensors
in V ⊗m.

(4) Mapd(Q, P ) ∼ (Q∨)⊗d ⊗ P ; this follows from the previous two claims.
(5) Again combining the previous two claims with (2.1) we conclude that there
is a rational map P 99K Q iﬀ Q is similar to P ⊗m for some m. (This is
called Amitsur’s theorem.)

We next deﬁne the spaces of Severi-Brauer subvarieties of a Severi-Brauer variety.
That is, given a Severi-Brauer variety P we look at the subset of the Chow variety
Chow(P ) parametrizing subvarieties X ⊂ P whose normalization ¯X is a Severi-
Brauer variety. For technical reasons it is better to work with ¯X → P .

Deﬁnition 11. Fix integers 0 ≤ m ≤ n, 1 ≤ d and a Severi-Brauer variety P
of dimension n. Let M ◦
Pm(P, d) denote the moduli space parametrizing morphisms
φ : Q → P satisfying the following assumptions.

(1) Q is a Severi-Brauer variety of dimension m.
(2) φ∗OP (1) ∼= OQ(d).
(3) Either m < n and φ : Q → φ(Q) is birational or m = n and every auto-
morphism of the triple (φ : Q → P ) that is the identity on P is also the
identity on Q.

(4) Two such morphisms φi : Qi → P are identiﬁed if there is an isomorphism

τ : Q1 ∼= Q2 such that φ1 = φ2 ◦ τ .

The spaces M ◦
Pm(P, d) are quasi-projective. They should be thought of as open
subschemes of the projective moduli spaces of stable maps ¯MPm(P, d) [Ale96]. Since
we are interested in their birational properties, these compactiﬁcations are not
important to us.

(Comment on the notation. The moduli space of maps from X to Y is frequently
denoted by Map(X, Y ). However, for moduli of stable maps from a genus g curve
to Y the usual notation is Mg(Y, β) where β is the homology class of the image. If
Y = Pn then β is usually replaced by deg β. Thus M ◦
Pm(P, d) follows mostly the
stable maps convention, except that the degree of φ(Q) is dm.)

6

J ´ANOS KOLL ´AR

Note that if φ : Q → φ(Q) is birational then every automorphism of φ : Q → P
that is the identity on P is also the identity on Q. This is why the most naive way
of identifying two maps is adequate in (4). (As we discussed earlier, failure of this
is one of the problems with ¯M0(P, 2) if dim P = 1.)

If d = 1 then we get M ◦

Pm(P, 1) = Grass(Pm, P ) and if m = 1 then the M ◦

P1(P, d)

are open subschemes of the space of genus 0 stable maps ¯M0(P, d).

These moduli spaces are closely related to the spaces of maps from Deﬁnition 9:

M ◦

Pm(P, d) bir∼ Mapd(Pm, P )/ Aut(Pm).

The resulting map Π : Mapd(Pm, P ) 99K M ◦
Pm(P, d) is not a product, not even bira-
tionally. Indeed the ﬁber of Π over a given φ : Q → P is the space of isomorphisms
Isom(Pm, Q). This is a principal homogeneous space under Aut(Pm) but it is not
isomorphic to Aut(Pm) unless Q is trivial.

Our aim is to understand the spaces M ◦

Pm(P, d) for arbitrary ground ﬁelds. This
is achieved only for m = 1 but we have the following general periodicity property.

Theorem 12. Let P ∼ P ′ be Brauer equivalent Severi-Brauer varieties of di-
mensions n, n′. Fix 0 ≤ m ≤ min{n, n′} and 1 ≤ d, d′. Assume that d ≡ d′
mod (m + 1). Then

M ◦

Pm(P, d) stab∼ M ◦

Pm(P ′, d′).

Proof. The idea is similar to the “no-name method” explained in [Dol87, Sec.4],

where it is attributed to Bogomolov and Lenstra.

Let IsomPm(d, P, d′, P ′) denote the scheme parametrizing triples

{(φ : Q → P ); (φ′ : Q′ → P ′); τ }

where (φ : Q → P ) ∈ M ◦
an isomorphism. (No further assumptions on φ and φ′ ◦ τ .) We prove that

Pm(P, d), (φ′ : Q′ → P ′) ∈ M ◦

Pm(P ′, d′), and τ : Q → Q′ is

M ◦

Pm(P, d) stab∼ IsomPm(d, P, d′, P ′) stab∼ M ◦

Pm(P ′, d′),

using the natural projections

π : IsomPm(d, P, d′, P ′) → M ◦

Pm(P, d)

and π′ : IsomPm(d, P, d′, P ′) → M ◦

Pm(P ′, d′).

It is suﬃcient to show that their generic ﬁbers are rational. The roles of d, d′ are
symmetrical, thus it is enough to consider π : IsomPm(d, P, d′, P ′) → M ◦

Pm(P, d).

Note that the ﬁber of π over (φ : Q → P ) consists of pairs

{(φ′ : Q′ → P ′); τ }

where (φ′ : Q′ → P ′) ∈ M ◦
Pm(P ′, d′) and τ : Q → Q′ is an isomorphism. Specifying
such a pair is the same as giving (φ ◦ τ : Q → P ′) ∈ Mapd(Q, P ′). Thus the ﬁber
of π over (φ : Q → P ) is isomorphic to Mapd′(Q, P ′).

Let K be the function ﬁeld of M ◦

Pm(P, d). We thus have a morphism

φK : QK → PK such that φ∗

KOPK (1) ∼= OQK (d).
By (10.4) φK corresponds to a K-point of Mapd(QK, PK ) ∼ (Q∨
(Q∨
know that Q⊗d′
hence in fact rational by (2.1). Therefore

K)⊗d ⊗ PK. Thus
K)⊗d ⊗ PK is rational by (2.1). Furthermore, since d ≡ d′ mod (m + 1), we
K is stably rational by (10.1),

K by (10.1), hence (Q∨

K ∼ Q⊗d

K)⊗d′

is also rational by (2.1).

(cid:3)

Remark 13. There are a few more cases when one can get stable birational equiv-
alences. For example, assume that d, d′ and per(P ) = per(P ′), the period of P , are
all relatively prime to m + 1. Then

KOPK (cid:0)per(P )(cid:1) ∼= OQK (cid:0)d′ · per(P )(cid:1)
φ∗

implies that QK is trivial. Using this observation for d′ = 1 we obtain that

M ◦

Pm(P, d) stab∼ M ◦

Pm(P ′, 1) ∼= Grass(Pm, P ′)

if

(cid:0)m + 1, d · per(P )(cid:1) = 1.

As a consequence of Theorem 12, in order to describe the stable birational types
Pm(P, d) for d ≤ m + 1. There are two

Pm(P, d), it is suﬃcient to understand M ◦

of M ◦
cases for which the answer is easy to derive.

Lemma 14. Let P be a Severi-Brauer variety. Then

(1) M ◦
(2) M ◦

Pm(P, d) stab∼ Grass(Pm, P ) if d ≡ 1 mod (m + 1).
Pm(P, d) stab∼ P if d ≡ 0 mod (m + 1) and (m + 1) | 420.

Proof. If d ≡ 1 mod (m + 1) then M ◦

Pm(P, d) stab∼ M ◦

Pm(P, 1) by Theorem 12

and, essentially by deﬁnition, M ◦

Pm(P, 1) = Grass(Pm, P ).

For the second claim we check the stable birational isomorphisms

M ◦

Pm(P, m + 1) stab∼ M ◦

Pm(P, m + 1) × P stab∼ P.

First let K be the function ﬁeld of M ◦
Pm(P, m + 1). We need to show that PK is
trivial. By assumption, there is a K-map in Mapm+1(QK, PK ) where dim QK = m.
By (10.4) this corresponds to a K-point of (Q∨
is
trivial, so Mapm+1(QK, PK ) ∼ PK and so PK is trivial.

K)⊗m+1 ⊗ PK. By (10.1) Q⊗m+1

K

For the second part, let L be the function ﬁeld of P . Then PL is trivial, hence

M ◦

Pm(PL, m + 1) ∼= M ◦

Pm(Pn

L, m + 1) bir∼ P(cid:0)H 0(Pm

L , OPm(m + 1))n+1(cid:1)/PGLm+1.

It is conjectured that this quotient if always stably rational, but this seems to be
known only when (m + 1) | 420; see [For02, p.316] and the references there.
(cid:3)

We give a geometric proof that the space of conics ¯M0(P, 2) is stably birational

to P for dim P ≥ 2.

15 (Conics in Severi-Brauer varieties). We compute, in 2 diﬀerent ways, the space
T parametrizing triples (C, ℓ1, ℓ2) where the ℓi are secant lines of C.

Forgetting the lines gives a map to ¯M0(P, 2). Let CK be the conic corresponding
to the generic point of ¯M0(P, 2). A secant line of CK is determined by Sym2 CK ∼=
K. Thus T bir∼ ¯M0(P, 2) × P4.
P2
The secants lines ℓi meet at a unique point; this gives a map T → P . Given
p ∈ P , the ﬁber is obtained by ﬁrst picking 2 points in P(TpP ) ∼= Pn−1
k(p). Once we
have 2 lines, they determine a plane hℓ1, ℓ2i and the 5-dimensional linear system
|ℓ1 + ℓ2| on the plane hℓ1, ℓ2i gives the conics. Thus T bir∼ P × P2n+3 and hence
¯M0(P, 2) stab∼ P .

16 (Proof of Theorem 1.7–8). If d = 2e is even then

¯M0(P, 2e) bir∼ MP1(P, 2e) stab∼ MP1(P, 2) bir∼ ¯M0(P, 2),

where the birational equivalences are by deﬁnition and the stable birational equiv-
alence holds by Theorem 12. Next ¯M0(P, 2) stab∼ P follows either from Lemma 14.2
or from Paragraph 15. This gives (1.7).

Similarly, if d = 2e + 1 is odd then (1.8) follows from

¯M0(P, 2e + 1) bir∼ MP1(P, 2e + 1) stab∼ MP1(P, 1) = Grass(P1, P ). (cid:3)

Remark 17. So far we have worked with a ﬁxed Severi-Brauer variety P , but it
would be interesting to understand how the MSym(P ) for diﬀerent Severi-Brauer
varieties interact with each other.

For example, assume that P, Q are Severi-Brauer varieties such that index(P )
and index(Q) are relatively prime. We claim that Symd(P ) and Syme(Q) are stably
birational to each other iﬀ they are both stably rational.

To see this, assume that Syme(Q) is not stably rational. By Corollary 4 this
holds iﬀ index(Q) ∤ e. Set K := k(P ). Since index(P ) and index(Q) are relatively
prime, index(QK) = index(Q), thus Syme(QK) is not stably rational by Corollary
4. By contrast, PK is trivial hence Symd(PK ) is stably rational; even rational by
[Mat68]. Thus Symd(P ) and Syme(Q) are not stably birational to each other.

Further steps in this direction are in Theorem 12; see also [Kol05, Hog09] for

related questions.
