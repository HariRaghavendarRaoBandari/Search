Cluster C∗-algebras and knot polynomials

Igor Nikolaev

Abstract

We construct a representation of the braid groups in a cluster C∗-
algebra coming from a triangulation of the Riemann surface S with
one or two cusps. It is shown that the Laurent polynomials attached
to the K-theory of such an algebra are topological invariants of the
closure of braids. In particular, the Jones and HOMFLY polynomials
of a knot correspond to the case S being a sphere with two cusps and
a torus with one cusp, respectively.

Introduction

t

The trace invariant VL(t) of a link L was introduced in [Jones 1985] [10].
The VL(t) is a Laurent polynomial Z[t± 1
2 ] obtained from a representation of
the braid group Bk in an operator (von Neumann) algebra Ak; the canonical
trace on Ak times a multiple
(1+t)2 is invariant of the Markov move of type
II of a braid b ∈ Bk. The Jones polynomial VL(t) is a powerful topological
invariant of a link L obtained by the closure of b. The algebra Ak itself comes
from an analog of the Galois theory for von Neumann algebras called basic
construction [Jones 1991, Section 2.6] [11]. It is yet unclear why the braid
groups appear in the context of operator algebras, let alone an invariant
trace with such a remarkable property; likewise, one can seek to extend the
invariant VL(t) to the multivariable Laurent polynomials.

Cluster algebras are a class of commutative rings introduced by [Fomin
& Zelevinsky 2002] [7] having deep roots in hyperbolic geometry and Te-
ichm¨uller theory [Williams 2014] [16]. Such an algebra A(x, B) is a sub-
ring of the ﬁeld of rational functions in n variables depending on a cluster
x = (x1, . . . , xn; y1, . . . , ym) of mutable variables xi and frozen variables yi
and a skew-symmetric matrix B = (bij) ∈ Mn(Z); the pair (x, B) is called a
seed. In terms of the coeﬃcients ci from a semi-ﬁeld (P,⊕,•) a new cluster
x′ = (x1, . . . , x′k, . . . , xn; c1, . . . , c′j, . . . , cn) and a new skew-symmetric matrix
B′ = (b′ij) is obtained from (x, B) by the exchange relations:

see [Williams 2014, Deﬁnition 2.22] [16] for the details. The seed (x′, B′)
is said to be a mutation of (x, B) in direction k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n; the
algebra A(x, B) is generated by cluster variables {xi}∞i=1 obtained from the
initial seed (x, B) by the iteration of mutations in all possible directions
k. The Laurent phenomenon proved by [Fomin & Zelevinsky 2002] [7] says
that A(x, B) ⊂ Z[x±1], where Z[x±1] is the ring of the Laurent polynomials
in variables x = (x1, . . . , xn); in other words, each generator xi of algebra
A(x, B) can be written as a Laurent polynomial in n variables with the
integer coeﬃcients. (Note that the Laurent phenomenon turns A(x, B) into
an additive abelian group with an order coming from the semi-group of the
Laurent polynomials with positive coeﬃcients.)
In what follows, we deal
with a cluster algebra A(x, Sg,n) coming from a triangulation of the Riemann
surface Sg,n of genus g with n cusps, see [Fomin, Shapiro & Thurston 2008]
[8] the details.

Cluster C∗-algebras are a class of non-commutative rings A(x, B), such
that K0(A(x, B)) ∼= A(x, B) [14]; here K0(A(x, B)) is the K0-group of a
C∗-algebra A(x, B) and ∼= is an isomorphism of the additive abelian groups
with order [Blackadar 1986] [2]. The A(x, B) is an AF -algebra given by the
Bratteli diagram [Bratteli 1972] [3]; such a diagram can be obtained from a
mutation tree of the initial seed (x, B) modulo an equivalence relation be-

2

tween the seeds lying at the same level. It is known that the AF -algebras are
characterized by their K-theory [Elliott 1976] [4]. Equivalently, the A(x, B)
is an algebra over the complex numbers generated by a series of projections
{ei}∞i=1.
The aim of our note is a representation of the braid group Bk =
{σ1, . . . , σk−1 | σiσi+1σi = σi+1σiσi+1, σiσj = σjσi if |i − j| ≥ 2} into an
algebra A(x, Sg,n), so that the Laurent phenomenon in K0(A(x, Sg,n)) cor-
responds to the polynomial invariants of the closure of braids b ∈ Bk. In
particular, if g = 0 and n = 2 or g = n = 1 one recovers the Jones in-
variant VL(t) or the HOMFLY polynomials of knots [Freyd, Yetter, Hoste,
Lickorish, Millet & Ocneanu 1985] [9], respectively. Whenever g ≥ 2 one gets
new topological invariants generalizing the Jones and HOMFLY polynomials
to an arbitrary (but ﬁnite) number of variables. The AF -algebra A(x, Sg,n)
itself can be viewed as an analog of the tower ∪∞k=1Ak of von Neumann al-
gebras Ak arising from the basic construction [Jones 1991, Section 3.4] [11].
Unlike [Jones 1985] [10], we exploit the phenomenon of cluster algebras and
the Birman-Hilden Theorem relating the braid groups B2g+n with the map-
ping class group of surface {Sg,n | n = 1; 2} [Birman & Hilden 1971] [1]. Our
main result can be formulated as follows.
Theorem 1 The formula σi 7→ ei + 1 deﬁnes a representation

ρ : ( B2g+1 → A(x, Sg,1)
B2g+2 → A(x, Sg,2).

(2)

If b ∈ B2g+1 (b ∈ B2g+2, resp.) is a braid, there exists a Laurent polyno-
mial [ρ(b)] ∈ K0(A(x, Sg,1)) ([ρ(b)] ∈ K0(A(x, Sg,2)), resp.) with the integer
coeﬃcients depending on 2g (2g + 1, resp.) variables, such that [ρ(b)] is a
topological invariant of the closure of b.

The article is organized as follows. We introduce preliminary facts and nota-
tion in Section 2. Theorem 1 is proved in Section 3. To illustrate theorem 1
in Section 4, we consider the cases g = 0, n = 2 and g = n = 1 corresponding
to the Jones and HOMFLY polynomials, respectively.

2 Preliminaries

We shall brieﬂy review the Birman-Hilden Theorem, the cluster C∗-algebras
and knots. We refer the reader to [Birman & Hilden 1971] [1], [Blackadar

1986] [2], [Farb & Margalit 2011] [5], [Fomin, Shapiro & Thurston 2008] [8],
[Jones 1985] [10], [Jones 1991, Lecture 6] [11], [Williams 2014] [16], [13] and
[14] for a detailed account.

2.1 Birman-Hilden Theorem
Let Sg,n be a Riemann surface of genus g ≥ 0 with n ≥ 1 cusps and such
that 2g − 2 + n > 0; denote by Tg,n ∼= R6g−6+2n the (decorated) Teichm¨uller
space of Sg,n, i.e. a collection of all Riemann surfaces of genus g with n
cusps endowed with the natural topology. By Mod Sg,n we understand the
mapping class group of surface Sg,n, i.e. a group of the homotopy classes
of orientation preserving automorphisms of Sg,n ﬁxing all cusps. It is well
known that two Riemann surfaces S, S′ ∈ Tg,n are isomorphic if and only if
there exists a ϕ ∈ Mod Sg,n, such that S′ = ϕ(S); thus each ϕ ∈ Mod Sg,n
corresponds to a homeomorphism of the Teichm¨uller space Tg,n.
If γ is a
simple closed curve on Sg,n, let Dγ ∈ Mod Sg,n be the Dehn twist around γ;
a pair of the Dehn twists Dγi and Dγj satisfy the braid relations:

( DγiDγj Dγi = Dγj DγiDγj ,

DγiDγj = Dγj Dγi,

if γi ∩ γj = {single point}
if γi ∩ γj = ∅.

A system of simple closed curves {γi} on Sg,n is called a chain, if

( γi ∩ γi+1 = {single point}
γi ∩ γj = ∅ otherwise.

(3)

(4)

Consider a chain {γ1, . . . , γ2g+1} shown in [Farb & Margalit 2011, Figure 2.7]
[5]. The fundamental domain of Sg,n obtained by a cut along the chain is a
(4g + 2)-gon with the opposite sides identiﬁed [Farb & Margalit 2011, Figure
2.2] [5]. A hyperelliptic involution ι ∈ Mod Sg,n is a rotation by the angle π
of the (4g + 2)-gon; clearly, the chain {γ1, . . . , γ2g+1} is an invariant of the
involution ι.
In what follows, we focus on the case n = 1 or 2. Notice that Sg,1 (Sg,2,
resp.) can be replaced by a surface of the same genus with one (two, resp.)
boundary components and no cusps; since the mapping class group preserves
the boundary components, we work with this new surface while keeping the
old notation. It is known that Sg,1 (Sg,2, resp.) is a double cover of a disk
D2g+1 (D2g+2, resp.)
inner points
of the disk; we refer the reader to [Farb & Margalit 2011, Figure 9.15] [5]

ramiﬁed at the 2g + 1 (2g + 2, resp.)

4

for a picture. It transpires that each automorphism of D2g+1 (D2g+2, resp.)
pulls back to an automorphism of Sg,1 (Sg,2, resp.) commuting with the
hyperelliptic involution ι. Recall that Mod D2g+1 ∼= B2g+1 (Mod D2g+2 ∼=
B2g+2, resp.); a subgroup of Mod Sg,1 (Mod Sg,2, resp.) commuting with
ι is called symmetric and denoted by SMod Sg,1 (SMod Sg,2, resp.) The
following result is critical.

Theorem 2 ([Birman & Hilden 1971] [1]) There exists an isomorphism:

(cid:26) B2g+1 ∼= SMod Sg,1
B2g+2 ∼= SMod Sg,2

(5)

given by the formula σi 7→ Dγi, where σi is a generator of the braid group
B2g+1 (B2g+2, resp.) and Dγi is the Dehn twist around the simple closed
curve γi of a chain in the Sg,1 (Sg,2, resp.)

2.2 Cluster C∗-algebras from Riemann surfaces

The fundamental domain of the Riemann surface Sg,n has a triangulation by
the 6g − 6 + 3n geodesic arcs γi; the endpoint of each γi is a cusp at the
absolute of Lobachevsky plane H = {x + iy ∈ C | y > 0}. Denote by l(γi)
the ± hyperbolic length of γi between two horocycles around the endpoints
of γi; consider the λ(γi) = exp ( 1
2l(γi)). The following result says that λ(γi)
are coordinates in the Teichm¨uller space Tg,n.

→ Tg,n is a

i=1

Remark 1 The six-tuples of numbers λ(γi) must satisfy the Ptolemy re-
lation λ(γ1)λ(γ2) + λ(γ3)λ(γ4) = λ(γ5)λ(γ6), where γ1, . . . , γ4 are pairwise
opposite sides and γ5, γ6 are the diagonals of a geodesic quadrilateral in H.
The n Ptolemy relations reduce the number of independent variables λ(γi)
to 6g − 6 + 2n = dim Tg,n.
Let T = {γi}6g−6+3n
be a triangulation of Sg,n; consider a skew-symmetric
matrix BT = (bij) of rank 6g − 6 + 3n, where bij is equal to the number of
triangles in T with sides γi and γj in clockwise order minus the number of
triangles in T with sides γi and γj in the counter-clockwise order. (For a
quick example of matrix BT we refer the reader to Section 4.)

Theorem 4 ([Fomin, Shapiro & D. Thurston 2008] [8]) The cluster
algebra A(x, BT ) does not depend on triangulation T , but only on the surface
Sg,n; namely, replacement of the geodesic arc γk by a new geodesic arc γ′k (a
ﬂip of γk) corresponds to a mutation µk of the seed (x, BT ).

Deﬁnition 1 The algebra A(x, Sg,n) := A(x, BT ) is called a cluster algebra
of the Riemann surface Sg,n.

A C∗-algebra is an algebra A over C with a norm a 7→ ||a|| and an involution
a 7→ a∗ such that it is complete with respect to the norm and ||ab|| ≤ ||a|| ||b||
and ||a∗a|| = ||a2|| for all a, b ∈ A. Any commutative C∗-algebra is isomor-
phic to the algebra C0(X) of continuous complex-valued functions on some
locally compact Hausdorﬀ space X; otherwise, A represents a noncommu-
tative topological space. For a unital C∗-algebra A, let V (A) be the union
(over n) of projections in the n × n matrix C∗-algebra with entries in A;
projections p, q ∈ V (A) are (Murray - von Neumann) equivalent if there ex-
ists a partial isometry u such that p = u∗u and q = uu∗. The equivalence
class of projection p is denoted by [p]; the equivalence classes of orthogonal
projections can be made to a semigroup by putting [p] + [q] = [p + q]. The
Grothendieck completion of this semigroup to an abelian group is called the
K0-group of the algebra A. The functor A → K0(A) maps the category
of unital C∗-algebras into the category of abelian groups, so that projec-
tions in the algebra A correspond to a positive cone K +
0 ⊂ K0(A) and the
unit element 1 ∈ A corresponds to an order unit u ∈ K0(A). The ordered
abelian group (K0, K +
0 , u) with an order unit is called a dimension group; an
order-isomorphism class of the latter we denote by (G, G+).

An AF -algebra A (Approximately Finite C∗-algebra) is deﬁned to be the
norm closure of an ascending sequence of ﬁnite dimensional C∗-algebras Mn,
where Mn is the C∗-algebra of the n × n matrices with entries in C; such
an algebra is given by an inﬁnite graph called Bratteli diagram, see [Brat-
teli 1972] [3] for a deﬁnition. The dimension group (K0(A), K +
0 (A), u) is a
complete isomorphism invariant of the algebra A [Elliott 1976] [4]. The order-
isomorphism class (K0(A), K +
0 (A)) is an invariant of the Morita equivalence
of algebra A, i.e. an isomorphism class in the category of ﬁnitely generated
projective modules over A. The scale Γ is a subset of K +
0 (A) which is gen-
erating, hereditary and directed, i.e.
0 (A) there exist
a1, . . . , ar ∈ Γ(A), such that a = a1 + . . . + ar; (ii) if 0 ≤ a ≤ b ∈ Γ, then
a ∈ Γ; (iii) given a, b ∈ Γ there exists c ∈ Γ, such that a, b ≤ c. If u is an

order unit, then the set Γ := {a ∈ K +
dimension group of algebra A can be written in the form (K0(A), K +

0 (A) | 0 ≤ a ≤ u} is a scale; thus the
0 (A), Γ).

Deﬁnition 2 ([14]) By a cluster C∗-algebra A(x, Sg,n) one understands an
AF -algebra satisfying an isomorphism of the scaled dimension groups:

(K0(A(x, Sg,n)), K +

0 (A(x, Sg,n)), u) ∼= (A(x, Sg,n),A+(x, Sg,n), u′),

(6)

where A+(x, Sg,n) is a semi-group of the Laurent polynomials with positive
coeﬃcients and u′ is an order unit in A+(x, Sg,n).
Remark 2 Theorems 3 and 4 imply that the algebra A(x, Sg,n) is a non-
commutative coordinate ring of the Teichm¨uller space Tg,n; in other words,
the diagram in Figure 1 must be commutative.

Remark 3 The A(x, Sg,n) is the norm-closure of an algebra of the non-
commutative polynomials Che1, e2, . . .i, where {ei}∞i=1 are projections in the
algebra A(x, Sg,n); this fact follows from the K-theory of A(x, Sg,n). On
the other hand, the algebra A(x, Sg,n) is generated by the cluster variables
{xi}∞i=1. We shall denote by ρ(xi) = ei a natural bijection between the two
sets of generators.

2.3 Knots and links

A knot is a tame embedding of the circle S1 into the Euclidean space R3; a
link with the n components is such an embedding of the union S1 ∪ . . . ∪ S1.

7

The classiﬁcation of (distinct) knots and links is a diﬃcult open problem of
topology. The Alexander Theorem says that every knot or link comes from
the closure of a braid b ∈ Bk = {σ1, . . . , σk−1 | σiσi+1σi = σi+1σiσi+1, σiσj =
σjσi if |i − j| ≥ 2}, i.e. tying the top end of each string of b to the end of
a string in the same position at the bottom. Thus the braids can classify
knots and links but sadly rather “unrelated” braids b ∈ Bk and b′ ∈ Bk′
can produce the same knot. Namely, the Markov Theorem says that the
closure of braids b, b′ ∈ Bk corresponds to the same knot or link, if and only
if: (i) b′ = gbg−1 for a braid g ∈ Bk or (ii) b′ = bσ±1
for the generator
σk ∈ Bk+1. Thus the Markov move of type II always pushes “to inﬁnity” the
desired classiﬁcation hinting that an asymptotic invariant is required; below
we consider two examples of such invariants.

The Jones polynomial of the closure L of a braid b ∈ Bk is deﬁned by the

formula:

VL(t) =  −

t + 1

√t !k−1

tr (rt(b)),

(7)

where rt is a representation of Bk in a von-Neumann algebra Ak and tr is a
trace function; the VL(t) ∈ Z[t± 1
2 ], i.e. a Laurent polynomial in the variable
√t [Jones 1985] [10]. If K is the unknot then VK(t) = 1 and each polynomial
VL(t) can be calculated from K using the skein relation:

VL− − tVL+ =  √t −

√t! VL,

(8)

where L+ (L−, resp.) is a link obtained by adding an overpass (underpass,
resp.) to the link L [Jones 1985, Theorem 12] [10].

The HOMFLY polynomial of a link L is a Laurent polynomial ρL(l, m) ∈
Z[l±1, m±1]; the ρL(l, m) is deﬁned recursively from the HOMFLY polynomial
ρK(l, m) = 1 of the unknot K using the skein relation:

lρL+ +

ρL− + mρL = 0,

where L+ (L−, resp.) is a link obtained by adding an overpass (underpass,
resp.) to L [Freyd, Yetter, Hoste, Lickorish, Millet & Ocneanu 1985, Remark
3] [9].

3 Proof of theorem 1

i

For the sake of clarity, let us outline the main ideas. Roughly speaking,
the Birman-Hilden’s Theorem 2 says that a generator σi ∈ B2g+1 (B2g+2,
resp.) is given by the Dehn twist Dγi ∈ Mod Sg,1 (Mod Sg,2, resp.) around
a closed curve γi. The Dγi itself is a homeomorphism of the Teichm¨uller
space Tg,1 (Tg,2, resp.); therefore the Dγi induced an inner automorphism
x 7→ uixu−1
, where ui is a unit of the cluster C∗-algebra A(x, Sg,1) (A(x, Sg,2),
resp.) (We refer the reader to Figure 1.) On the other hand, the Fomin-
Shapiro-D. Thurston’s Theorem 4 and remark 3 imply that units ui and
projections ei in algebra A(x, Sg,1) (A(x, Sg,2), resp.) are bijective. But the
minimal degree polynomial in variable ei corresponding to a unit ui is a linear
polynomial of the form ui = aei + b, where a and b are complex constants.
(The inverse is given by the formula u−1
b .) The Birman-
Hilden’s Theorem 2 implies that the ui satisfy the braid relations {uiui+1ui =
if |i − j| ≥ 2}; moreover, if one substitutes ui =
ui+1uiui+1, uiuj = ujui,
aei + b in the braid relations, then:

i = − a

(10)

Remark 4 The relations (10) are invariant of the involution e∗i = ei if
and only if (a+b)b
a2 ∈ R; in this case the algebra A(x, Sg,1) (A(x, Sg,2), resp.)
contains a ﬁnite-dimensional C∗-algebra A2g (A2g+1, resp.) obtained from the
norm closure of a self-adjoint representation of a Temperley-Lieb algebra.

Thus one gets a representation ρ : B2g+1 → A(x, Sg,1) (B2g+2 → A(x, Sg,2),

n (cid:19) = n’th Catalan number, where n = 2g
closed; moreover, |E| ≤ 1
(n = 2g + 1, resp.) In particular, the A2g (A2g+1, resp.) of remark 4 is a
ﬁnite-dimensional C∗-algebra and each element ε ∈ E is equivalent to a pro-
jection; the (Murray-von Neumann) equivalence class of the projection will
be denoted by [ε]. If {b = σk1

folds into a ﬁnite sum nP|E|i=1 aiεi | εi ∈ E, ai ∈ Zo. Therefore one gets an in-
clusion [ρ(b)] := nP|E|i=1 ai[εi] | [εi] ∈ K0(A(x, Sg,1)), ai ∈ Zo ∈ K0(A(x, Sg,1)
(K0(A(x, Sg,2), resp.) But K0(A(x, Sg,n)) ∼= A(x, Sg,n) ⊂ Z[x±1], where n = 1
(n = 2, resp.); thus [ρ(b)] ∈ K0(A(x, Sg,n) is a Laurent polynomial with the
integer coeﬃcients depending on 2g (2g + 1, resp.) variables. The [ρ(b)] is in
fact a topological invariant of the closure of b. Indeed, [ρ(gbg−1)] = [ρ(b)] for
all b ∈ B2g+1 (B2g+2, resp.) because the K0-group and a canonical trace τ
on the algebra A(x, Sg,1) (A(x, Sg,2), resp.) are related [Blackadar 1986, Sec-
tion 7.3] [2]; since the τ is a character of the representation ρ, one gets the
formula [ρ(gbg−1)] = [ρ(b)]. An invariance of the [ρ(b)] with respect to the
Markov move of type II is a bit subtler, but follows from a stability of the K-
theory [Blackadar 1986, Section 5.1] [2]. Namely, the map σ±1
2g+1 7→ 2e2g+1−1
(σ±1
2g+2 7→ 2e2g+2−1, resp.) gives rise to a crossed product C∗-algebra A2g ⋊αG
(A2g+1 ⋊α G, resp.), where G ∼= Z/2Z; the crossed product is isomorphic to
the algebra M2(Aα
2g+1, resp.) is the ﬁxed-
point algebra of the automorphism α [Fillmore 1996, Section 3.8.5] [6]. But

2g+1)] = [ρ(b)] for all b ∈ B2g+1 (B2g+2, resp.)
We shall pass to a detailed proof of theorem 1 by splitting the argument

into a series of lemmas.
Lemma 1 The map {σi 7→ ei+1 | 1 ≤ i ≤ 2g} ({σi 7→ ei+1 | 1 ≤ i ≤ 2g+1},
resp.) deﬁnes a representation ρ : B2g+1 → A(x, Sg,1) (ρ : B2g+2 → A(x, Sg,2),
resp.) of the braid group with an odd (an even, resp.) number of strings into
a cluster C∗-algebra of a Riemann surface with one cusps (two cusps, resp.)
Proof. We shall prove the case ρ : B2g+1 → A(x, Sg,1) of the braid groups with
an odd number of strings; the case of an even number of strings is treated
likewise.

Let {γ1, . . . , γ2g} be a chain of simple closed curves on the surface Sg,1.
The Dehn twists {Dγ1, . . . , Dγ2g} around γi satisfy the braid relations (3).
The subgroup SMod Sg,1 of Mod Sg,1 consisting of the automorphisms of
Sg,1 commuting with the hyperelliptic involution ι is isomorphic to the braid
group B2g+1 (Birman-Hilden’s Theorem 2).

On the other hand, each Dγi is a homeomorphism of the Teichm¨uller
space Tg,1; the Dγi induces an inner automorphism of the cluster C∗-algebra

10

A(x, Sg,1), see remark 2. We shall denote such an automorphism by

{uixu−1

| ui ∈ A(x, Sg,1), ∀x ∈ A(x, Sg,1)}.

The units {ui ∈ A(x, Sg,1) | 1 ≤ i ≤ 2g} satisfy the braid relations:

(cid:26) uiui+1ui = ui+1uiui+1,

uiuj = ujui,

if |i − j| ≥ 2.

Indeed, from (3) one gets SMod Sg,1 = {Dγ1, . . . , Dγ2g | DγiDγi+1Dγi =
Dγi+1DγiDγi+1, DγiDγj = Dγj Dγi if |i − j| ≥ 2}. If Inn A(x, Sg,1) is a group
of the inner automorphisms of the algebra A(x, Sg,1), then {ui | 1 ≤ i ≤ 2g}
are generators of the Inn A(x, Sg,1). Using the commutative diagram in Fig-
ure 1, one gets from DγiDγi+1Dγi = Dγi+1DγiDγi+1 the equality uiui+1ui =
ui+1uiui+1; similarly, the DγiDγj = Dγj Dγi implies the equality uiuj = ujui
for |i − j| ≥ 2. In particular, SMod Sg,1 ∼= Inn A(x, Sg,1), where the isomor-
phism is given by the formula Dγi 7→ ui.
It remains to express the units ui in terms of generators ei of the algebra
A(x, Sg,1). The ei itself is not invertible, but a polynomial ui(ei) = ei + 1 has
2ei + 1. From an isomorphism B2g+1 ∼= SMod Sg,1 given
an inverse u−1
by the formula σi 7→ Dγi one gets a representation ρ : B2g+1 → A(x, Sg,1)
given by the formula σi 7→ ei + 1. Lemma 1 is proved.
Corollary 1 The norm closure of a self-adjoint representation of a Temperley-
Lieb algebra T L2g( i√2

Proof. Let us substitute ui = ei + 1 into the braid relations (12). The reader
is encouraged to verify that relations (12) are equivalent to the following
system of relations:

e2
i = ei, e∗i = ei,
eiei±1ei = −2ei,
eiej = ejei,

if |i − j| ≥ 2.

2 ei brings (13) to the form:

2 ei,

i = i√2

eiej = ejei,

if |i − j| ≥ 2.

The relations (14) are deﬁning relations for a Temperley-Lieb algebra T L2g( i√2

(T L2g+1( i√2
2 ), resp.), see e.g. [Jones 1991, p. 85] [11]; such an algebra is al-
ways ﬁnite-dimensional, see next lemma. Corollary 1 follows.

n (cid:19) ,

Proof. An elegant proof of this fact is based on a representation of the
relations (14) by the diagrams of the non-crossing strings reminiscent of the
braid diagrams.

Corollary 2 Each element e ∈ E is equivalent to a projection in the cluster
C∗-algebra A(x, Sg,1) (A(x, Sg,2), resp.)

Proof. Indeed, if e ∈ E then the e2 must coincide with one of the elements
of E. But e2 cannot be any such, except for the e itself. Thus e2 = e, i.e. e
is an idempotent. On the other hand, it is well known that each idempotent
in a C∗-algebra is (Murray-von Neumann) equivalent to a projection in the
same algebra, see e.g.
[Blackadar 1986, Proposition 4.6.2] [2]. Corollary 2
follows.

Lemma 3 If b ∈ B2g+1 (b ∈ B2g+2, resp.) is a braid, there exists a Laurent
polynomial [ρ(b)] with the integer coeﬃcients depending on 2g (2g + 1, resp.)
variables, such that [ρ(b)] ∈ K0(A(x, Sg,1)) ([ρ(b)] ∈ K0(A(x, Sg,2)), resp.)
Proof. We shall prove this fact for the braid groups with an odd number of
strings; the case of an even number of strings is treated likewise.

1 . . . σk2g

Let {b = σk1

2g ∈ B2g+1 | ki ∈ Z} be a braid. By lemma 1 such a
braid has a representation ρ(b) in the cluster C∗-algebra A(x, Sg,1) given by
the formula:

ρ(b) = (e1 + 1)k1 . . . (e2g + 1)k2g ∈ A(x, Sg,1).

(16)

12

One can unfold the product (16) into a sum of the monomials in variables ei;
by lemma 2 any such monomial is an element of the set E. In other words,
one gets a ﬁnite sum:

ρ(b) = 


|E|

Xi=1

aiεi | εi ∈ E, ai ∈ Z


.

(17)

(Note that whenever ki < 0 the coeﬃcient ai is a rational number, but
clearing the denominators we can assume ai ∈ Z.) On the other hand,
corollary 2 says that each εi is a projection; therefore εi deﬁnes an equivalence
class [εi] ∈ K0(A(x, Sg,1)) of projections in the cluster C∗-algebra A(x, Sg,1).
Thus one gets [ρ(b)] ∈ K0(A(x, Sg,1)) given by a ﬁnite sum

[ρ(b)] = 


|E|

Laurent polynomial with the integer coeﬃcients.

But K0(A(x, Sg,1)) ∼= A(x, Sg,1) ⊂ Z[x±1]; in particular, [ρ(b)] ∈ Z[x±1] is a
To calculate the number of variables in [ρ(b)], recall that rank A(x, Sg,1) =
6g − 3; on the other hand, a fundamental domain of the Riemann surface
Sg,1 is a paired (4g + 2)-gon, where one pair of sides corresponds to a bound-
ary component obtained from the cusp, see Section 2.1. Since the boundary
component contracts to a cusp, one gets a paired 4g-gon whose triangulation
requires 4g − 3 interior geodesic arcs. Thus the cluster |x| = 6g − 3 can be
written in the form:

x = (x1, . . . , x2g; y1, . . . , y4g−3),

(19)

where xi are mutable and yi are frozen variables [Williams 2014, Deﬁnition
2.6] [16]. One can always assume yi = Const and therefore the Laurent
polynomial [ρ(b)] depends on the 2g variables xi. Lemma 3 follows.

Lemma 4 The Laurent polynomial [ρ(b)] is a topological invariant of the
closure of the braid b ∈ B2g+1 (b ∈ B2g+2, resp.)
Proof. Again we shall prove the case b ∈ B2g+1; the case b ∈ B2g+1 can be
treated similarly and is left to the reader. To prove that [ρ(b)] is a topological
invariant, it is enough to demonstrate that:

13

(i) [ρ(gbg−1)] = [ρ(b)] for all g ∈ B2g+1;
(ii) [ρ(bσ±1

2g+1)] = [ρ(b)] for the generator σ2g+1 ∈ B2g+2.

(i) Recall that the K-theory of an AF -algebra A(x, Sg,1) can be recovered
from the canonical trace τ : A(x, Sg,1) → C [Blackadar 1986, Section 7.3]
[2]. On the other hand, the trace τ is a character of the representation
ρ : B2g+1 → A(x, Sg,1); in particular, τ (ρ(g)ρ(b)ρ(g−1)) = τ (ρ(b)). In other
words, [ρ(gbg−1)] = [ρ(b)] for all g ∈ B2g+1. Item (i) follows.

(ii) Let A2g be a ﬁnite-dimensional C∗-algebra of corollary 1. Let u2g+1
2g+1 be a unit and its inverse in the algebra A(x, Sg,1) given by the

and u−1
formulas:

u2g+1 = u−1

2g+1 := 2e2g+1 − 1.

(20)

2g+1 6∈ A2g and they make the group G ∼= Z/2Z under
Clearly the units u±1
a multiplication. We shall consider an extension A2g ⋊ G of the algebra A2g
given by the formal sums

A2g ⋊ G := 
Xγ∈G


aγuγ | uγ ∈ A2g


.

(21)

(The algebra of formal sums (21) is isomorphic to a crossed product C∗-
algebra of the algebra A2g by the outer automorphisms α given the elements
uγ ∈ {u±1

2g+1}; hence our notation.) It is well known that

A2g ⋊ G ∼= M2(Aα

2g),

(22)

2g ⊂ A2g is a ﬁxed-point algebra of the automorphism α : A2g → A2g,
[Fillmore 1996, Section 3.8.5] [6]. By the second of formulas (12),

where Aα
see e.g.
one gets uiu2g+1 = u2g+1ui for all 1 ≤ i ≤ 2g − 1; in other words,

ui = u2g+1uiu−1

2g+1

(23)

for all 1 ≤ i ≤ 2g − 1. Since all generators ui of algebra A2g−1 are ﬁxed by
the automorphism α, one gets an isomorphism

(24)
On the other hand, K0(M2(A)) ∼= K0(A) by a stability of the K-theory
[Blackadar 1986, Section 5.1] [2]; thus formulas (22) and (24) imply an iso-
morphism:

Aα

2g ∼= A2g−1.

K0(A2g ⋊ G) ∼= K0(A2g−1).

(25)

14

It remains to notice that if one maps the generators σ±1
units u±1

2g+1 ∈ A2g ⋊ G, then formulas (21) and (25) imply the equality

2g+1 ∈ B2g+2 into the

[ρ(bσ±1

2g+1)] = [ρ(b)]

(26)

for all b ∈ B2g. The item (ii) follows from (26) and lemma 4 is proved.

Theorem 1 follows from lemmas 1, 3 and 4.

4 Examples

To illustrate theorem 1, we shall consider a representation ρ : B2 → A(x, S0,2)
(ρ : B3 → A(x, S1,1), resp.); it will be shown that for such a representation
the Laurent polynomials [ρ(b)] correspond to the Jones (HOMFLY, resp.)
invariants of knots and links.

4.1 Jones polynomials

If g = 0 and n = 2, then S0,2 is a sphere with two cusps; the S0,2 is homotopy
equivalent to an annulus A := {z = u + iv ∈ C | r ≤ |z| ≤ R}. The
Riemann surface A has an ideal triangulation T with one marked point on
each boundary component given by the matrix:

BT = (cid:18) 0
−2

2

0(cid:19) ,

(27)

see [Fomin, Shapiro & Thurston 2008, Example 4.4] [8]. Using the exchange
relations (1) the reader can verify that the cluster C∗-algebra A(x, S0,2) is
given by the Bratteli diagram shown in Figure 2; the A(x, S0,2) coincides
with the so-called GICAR algebra [Bratteli 1972, Section 5.5] [3].

The cluster x = (x; c) consists of a mutable variable x and a coeﬃcient
c ∈ (P,⊕,•). Theorem 1 says that there exists a representation

ρ : B2 → A(x, S0,2),

(28)
such that [ρ(b)] ∈ Z[x±1] is a topological invariant of the closure L of b ∈ B2;
since the Laurent polynomial [ρ(b)] depends on x and c, we shall write it
[ρ(b)](x, c). Let N ≥ 1 be the minimal number of the overpass (underpass,
resp.) crossings added to the unknot K to get the link L [Jones 1985, Fig-
ure 2] [10]. The following result compares the [ρ(b)](x, c) with the Jones
polynomial VL(t).

[ρ(b)](t,−t2).

(29)

Proof. Recall that each polynomial [ρ(b)](x, c) is obtained from an initial
seed (x, BT ) by a ﬁnite number of mutation given by the exchange relations
(1); likewise, each polynomial VL(t) can be obtained from the VK(t) = 1
using the skein relation (8). Roughly speaking, the idea is to show that (1)
√t
and (8) are equivalent relations up to a multiple −
t+1 . Indeed, consider the
Laurent polynomials:

WL+ = (cid:16)− t+1√t (cid:17) VL+
WL− = (cid:16)− t+1√t (cid:17) VL−.



transforms the skein relation (31) to the exchange relations (1). It remains to
observe from (30), that an extra crossing added to the unknot K corresponds
√t
to a multiplication of [ρ(b)](x, c) by −
t+1 ; the minimal number N of such
crossings required to get the link L from K gives us the N-th power of the
multiple. Corollary 3 follows.

4.2 HOMFLY polynomials

If g = n = 1, then S1,1 is a torus with a cusp. The matrix BT associated to
an ideal triangulation of the Riemann surface S1,1 has the form:

BT = 

(33)

see [Fomin, Shapiro & Thurston 2008, Example 4.6] [8]. Using the exchange
relations (1) the reader can verify that the cluster C∗-algebra A(x, S1,1) is
given by the Bratteli diagram shown in Figure 3; the A(x, S1,1) coincides
with the Mundici algebra M1 [Mundici 1988] [12].

The formula (19) implies that cluster x = (x1, x2; y1) consists of two mutable
variables x1, x2 and a frozen variable y1. Theorem 1 says that there exists a
representation:

1 , x±1

ρ : B3 → A(x, S1,1),
such that [ρ(b)] ∈ Z[x±1
2 ] is a topological invariant of the closure L of
b ∈ B3; since the Laurent polynomial [ρ(b)] depends on two variables x1, x2
and two coeﬃcients c1, c2 ∈ (P,⊕,•), we shall write it [ρ(b)](x1, x2; c1, c2).
The following result says that the [ρ(b)](x1, x2; c1, c2) for special values of ci
is related to the HOMFLY polynomial ρL(l, m). (Unlike (29), an explicit
formula for such a relationship seems to be complicated.)

(34)

Corollary 4 The exchange relations (1) with matrix B given by (33) imply
the skein relation (9) for the HOMFLY polynomial ρL(l, m).

17

Proof. Since the variable y1 is frozen, we consider a reduced matrix:

˜BT = (cid:18) 0
−2

2

0(cid:19)

(35)

and our seed has the form (x, ˜BT ), where x = (x1, x2; c1, c2). The exchange
relations (1) for the variables x3, x4, x5 and the coeﬃcient c3 imply the fol-
lowing system of equations:

(36)

(37)

x3 = c1+x2
(c1+1)x1
x4 = c2x2

brings (38) to the skein relation (9). Corollary 4 follows.
