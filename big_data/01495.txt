Heat kernel asymptotics on sequences of elliptically

degenerating Riemann surfaces

D. Garbin and J. Jorgenson

22 Feb 2016

Dedicated to Dennis Hejhal,
on the occasion of his 67th belated happy birthday

Abstract

This is the ﬁrst of two articles in which we deﬁne an elliptically degenerating family of hyper-
bolic Riemann surfaces and study the asymptotic behavior of the associated spectral theory.
Our study is motivated by a result from [He 83], which Hejhal attributes to Selberg, prov-
ing spectral accumulation for the family of Hecke triangle groups. In this article, we prove
various results regarding the asymptotic behavior of heat kernels and traces of heat kernels
for both real and complex time.
In [GJ 16], we will use the results from this article and
study the asymptotic behavior of numerous spectral functions through elliptic degeneration,
including spectral counting functions, Selberg’s zeta function, Hurwitz-type zeta functions,
determinants of the Laplacian, wave kernels, spectral projections, small eigenfunctions, and
small eigenvalues. The method of proof we employ follows the template set in previous arti-
cles which study spectral theory on degenerating families of ﬁnite volume Riemann surfaces
([HJL 95], [HJL 97], [JoLu 97a], and [JoLu 97b]) and on degenerating families of ﬁnite vol-
ume hyperbolic three manifolds ([DJ 98]). Although the types of results developed here and
in [GJ 16] are similar to those in existing articles, it is necessary to thoroughly present all
details in the setting of elliptic degeneration in order to uncover all nuances in this setting.

Introduction

The last result stated by Hejhal in his monumental work [He 83] is a qualitative theorem,
which he attributes to Selberg, concerning spectral accumulation at the bottom of the range of
the continuous spectrum for the family of Hecke triangle groups. In brief, the present article is
the ﬁrst in a series of two papers in which we further generalize and quantify the Hejhal-Selberg
theorem. Before describing our work, let us discuss the theorem from page 579 of [He 83] which
serves as motivation for our study.

For any integer N ≥ 3, consider the two matrices

(cid:18)0 −1
(cid:19)

(cid:18)1

and

2 cos(π/N )

(cid:19)

.

These matrices generate a discrete subgroup of PSL(2, R), denoted by GN , and called the Hecke
triangle group. The group GN acts on the upper half plane H, and through elementary consider-
ations one can show that the set

{z ∈ H :
is a fundamental domain for GN\H.

|z| > 1 and |Re(z)| < cos(π/N )}

Let ∆ denote the Laplacian associated to the hyperbolic metric on H. We will assume knowl-
edge of the spectral theory of the Laplacian acting on smooth functions on GN\H, referring the
reader to [He 83] and references therein for background material. In particular, we use that for
each N , Weyl’s law associated to the Laplacian consists of counting discrete eigenvalues of the
Laplacian as well as poles of the determinant ϕN (s) of the scattering matrix which is computed
from the constant terms in the Fourier expansion of a non-holomorphic (parabolic) Eisenstein se-
ries. With this albeit brief description of background material, we can now state the Hejhal-Selberg
result.

For any t0 ∈ R and δ > 0, there is an N0 such that if N > N0, the set [1/2−δ, 1/2)×[t0−δ, t0+δ]

will contain a pole of ϕN .

In words, the poles of ϕN are densely accumulating along the line Re(s) = 1/2.

At this time, there is a number of natural questions which one can pose. Firstly, can one
further quantify the Hejhal-Selberg result beyond the assertion regarding accumulation of poles
of ϕN ? Observe that the above stated fundamental domains converge, as N tends to inﬁnity, to
a region which is a fundamental domain for the discrete group generated by

and

Does the asymptotic behavior of the spectral theory of GN\H, in whatever form, converge to
the spectral theory of the limiting fundamental domain? Finally, is the Hejhal-Selberg theorem
indicative of a general phenomena which exists for other sequences of geometric objects?

The purpose of this article and the subsequent paper [GJ 16] is to explore in detail these
questions. We begin, in this article, by deﬁning an elliptically degenerating family of hyperbolic
Riemann surfaces, one example of which is the sequence of Hecke triangle groups. In eﬀect, an
elliptically degenerating sequence is obtained by choosing a ﬁxed hyperbolic Riemann surface M
with a ﬁnite set of points P1,··· , Pq, and then we change the local coordinate at each point Pj
from a complex variable z to z1/nj , and then we let each nj approach inﬁnity.

Having established the general setting which we will study, we then focus our attention to
the heat kernel associated to the hyperbolic Laplacian ∆ which acts on smooth functions on
the underlying surface. In the present article, we prove a number of results corresponding to the
asymptotic behavior of the heat kernel, and traces of the heat kernel, on an elliptically degenerating

3

family of Riemann surfaces. In addition to pointwise convergence results, we study the asymptotic
behavior of the trace of the heat kernel for small time, large time, and complex time, and in each
case we establish asymptotic expansions in the degenerating parameters with attention paid to
uniformity issues. In the present article, we slightly deviate from the heat kernel itself by proving
convergence of the small eigenvalues and small eigenvalues, and we do so in order to strengthen
the convergence results we derive.

In the subsequent article [GJ 16], we use the heat kernel convergence results proved here
to study the asymptotic behavior of numerous spectral functions through elliptic degeneration,
including spectral counting functions, Selberg’s zeta function, Hurwitz-type zeta functions, de-
terminants of the Laplacian, wave kernels, spectral projections, small eigenfunctions, and small
eigenvalues. At that time, a corollary of our more general theorem will be a quantitative version,
with error term, of the Hejhal-Selberg result, thus answering one of the questions posed above.

The method of proof we employ follows the template set in previous articles which study
spectral theory on degenerating families of ﬁnite volume Riemann surfaces ([HJL 95], [HJL 97],
[JoLu 97a], and [JoLu 97b]) and on degenerating families of ﬁnite volume hyperbolic three mani-
folds ([DJ 98]). Although the types of results developed here and in [GJ 16] are similar to those
in existing articles, it is necessary to thoroughly present all details in the setting of elliptic degen-
eration in order to uncover all nuances in this setting. Additionally, we did not believe it would
be “mathematically honest” to simply assert that the methodology of these articles applies in the
setting of elliptically degenerating surfaces, so in addition to proving a translation of the method
to the setting of elliptically degenerating surfaces, we felt it necessary to provide veriﬁcation of
details.

Aside from its interest within the ﬁeld of spectral analysis, the problem of studying elliptically
degenerating Riemann surfaces has manifested itself elsewhere. In [vP 10], von Pippich deﬁned and
studied elliptic Eisenstein series, ultimately proving analogues of the classical theorems, namely
diﬀerential equation, meromorphic continuation, and Kronecker limit formula. In [GvP 09], the
authors studied elliptic Eisenstein series through elliptic degeneration. One of their main result
was to prove that certain elliptic Eisenstein series, when rescaled, converge to parabolic Eisenstein
series through elliptic degeneration. We refer to [vP 10] and [GvP 09] for more precise statements
and proofs.

Recently, Freixas i Montplet and von Pippich have undertaken a fascinating project involving
elliptic degeneration. Let Mg,n denote the moduli space of genus g hyperbolic Riemann surfaces
with n marked points. The Takhtajan–Zograf form ωTZ on Mg,n is constructed using (parabolic)
Eisenstein series associated to the marked points. The relation of ωTZ to the Weil–Petersson form
ωWP is given by a local index theorem which can be derived from an arithmetic Riemann–Roch
isometry. In [FvP 11], the authors are studying an analogue of ωTZ on the moduli space of Riemann
surfaces with n marked weighted points using elliptic Eisenstein series. Initially, they are striving
towards an arithmetic Riemann–Roch isometry, the computation of the relative determinant of
the Laplacian on an hyperbolic cone. Having established the isometry, in the sense of Arakelov
theory, the authors plan to work toward showing a “consistency” with their work and previously
established isometries by studying their identity through elliptic degeneration. Consequently, the
signiﬁcance of the analysis in the present paper goes beyond the applications we develop in [GJ 16].

The project of deﬁning and studying hyperbolic spectral theory through elliptic degeneration
was initiated in the early 1990’s by the second named author (JJ) when he was collaborating with
R. Lundelius. Indeed, the project was referred to as “in preparation” in several previous publica-
tions. Unfortunately, the distinction of “in preparation” was very premature. By 1995, Lundelius
left academic mathematics, and by 1997, Jorgenson had completed all aspects of papers which
were published as jointly written with Lundelius. Approximately ten years later, the ﬁrst named
author (DG) developed the question of elliptic degeneration as part of his own investigations.
The present article as well as [GJ 16] are the product of the consequent collaboration of the two
authors of the articles.

1 Geometry of elliptic degeneration

In this section we will present the notion of elliptic degeneration of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces.
We will consider ﬁnite volume surfaces (compact or non-compact), having elliptic ﬁxed points of
ﬁnite order, i.e. surfaces with conical ends. Elliptic degeneration occurs when the orders of such
elliptic ﬁxed points are increasing without a bound: As these orders are running oﬀ to inﬁnity, their
corresponding cone angles approach zero. Alternatively, as elliptic elements of the fundamental
group become parabolic, their corresponding conical ends turn into cusps.

Let M be a connected hyperbolic Riemann surface of ﬁnite volume, either compact or non-
compact. For simplicity, let us assume that M is connected, so then M can be realized as the
quotient manifold Γ\H, where H is the hyperbolic upper half space and Γ is a discrete subgroup
of SL(2, R)/{±1}.

Aside from the identity, the elements of Γ can be classiﬁed into three classes, according to
the type of their ﬁxed points when viewed as fractional linear transformations or equivalently to
the value of their absolute trace if viewed as matrices. An element γ ∈ Γ is called hyperbolic,
parabolic, or elliptic, if γ is conjugated in SL(2, R) to a dilation, horizontal translation, or rotation
respectively. This is analogous to |Tr(γ)| being greater than, equal, or less than 2, respectively.
Furthermore, an element γ is called primitive, if it is not a power other than ±1 of any other
element of the group. With this in mind, a primitive hyperbolic element γ is conjugated to

, where (cid:96)γ is the length of the simple closed geodesic on the surface M in

the homotopy class of γ. A primitive parabolic element γ is conjugated to

, where

wγ denotes the width of the cusp ﬁxed by γ, while a primitive elliptic element γ is conjugated

, where 2π/qγ is the angle of the conical point ﬁxed by γ. The

positive integer qγ is the order of the centralizer subgroup of the elliptic element γ. We will say
that the corresponding elliptic ﬁxed point has order qγ.

For a given positive integer q, let Cq denote the inﬁnite hyperbolic cone of angle 2π/q. One

can realize Cq as a half-inﬁnite cylinder

Cq = {(ρ, θ) : ρ > 0, θ ∈ [0, 2π)} .

(1.1)

equipped with a smooth metric such that the length of meridians of constant ρ, which we denote
here by (cid:96)(ρ), goes to zero as ρ approaches zero (see Fig. 1). Consider the Riemannian metric
given by

ds2 = dρ2 + q−2 sinh2(ρ)dθ2 .

(1.2)

It easily follows that (cid:96)(ρ) =

sinh(ρ) . The notion of angle is deﬁned as the rate of change in

the length of the circle with respect to the change in distance near ρ = 0, namely

provided that the limit exists. That d(ρ2, ρ1) = |ρ2 − ρ1|, implies that Cq is an inﬁnite hyperbolic
cone of angle 2π/q with apex at ρ = 0. It is elementary to show that the volume form of the

manifold Cq is given by

(1.3)

A fundamental domain for Cq in the hyperbolic unit disc model is provided by a sector with
vertex at the origin and with angle 2π/q. In coordinates, we write {α exp(iφ) : 0 ≤ α < 1, 0 ≤
φ < 2π/q}. The hyperbolic metric on Cq is the metric induced onto the fundamental domain
viewed as a subset of the unit disc endowed with its complete hyperbolic metric. The isotropy
subgroup which corresponds to this fundamental domain consists of the numbers exp(2πik/q) for
k = 1, 2,··· , q acting by multiplication. A direct computation shows if z = (ρ, θ) and γq denotes
a generator of the fundamental group of Cq, then

cosh d(z, γn

q z) = 1 + 2 sin2(πn/q) sinh2(ρ).

(1.4)

Let Cq,ε denote the submanifold of Cq obtained by restricting the ﬁrst coordinate of (ρ, θ) to
0 ≤ ρ < cosh
−1(1 + εq/2π). A fundamental domain for Cq,ε in the unit disc model is obtained
by adding the restriction that α < (εq/(4π + εq))1/2. An elementary calculation shows that the
volume of this manifold vol(Cq,ε) = ε, and the length of the boundary of Cq,ε is (4πε/q + ε2)1/2.
For ε1 < ε2 one can show that the length between the boundaries of the two nested cones Cq,ε1
and Cq,ε2 is

dH(∂Cq,ε1, ∂Cq,ε2) = log

(cid:32)

ε2q + 2π +(cid:112)ε2q(4π + ε2q)
ε1q + 2π +(cid:112)ε1q(4π + ε1q)

(cid:33)

.

Let C∞ denote an inﬁnite cusp. A fundamental domain for C∞ in the upper half plane is
given by the set {x + iy : y > 0, 0 < x < 1}. A fundamental domain for C∞ in the upper half
plane is obtained by identifying the boundary points iy with 1 + iy. The isotropy subgroup that
corresponds to the above fundamental domain consists of Z acting by addition. As before, let
C∞,ε denote the submanifold of C∞ obtained by restricting the y coordinate of the fundamental
domain given above to y > 2ε. Easy computations show that vol(C∞,ε) = ε/2, and the length of
the boundary of C∞,ε is also ε/2.

Following Section 2 of [Ju 98], we are now ready to deﬁne the concept of elliptic degeneration.
In its quintessential form, elliptic degeneration turns a cone of ﬁnite order q into a cone of inﬁnite
order, i.e. a cusp (see Fig. 2). To view this, we realize the positive angle cone Cq as the half-inﬁnite
cylinder {(x, y) : x ∈ [0, 1), y ∈ (0,∞)}, by changing the (ρ, θ) coordinates in (1.1) as θ = 2πx and
−1(e−αy), where α = 2π/q. In (x, y) coordinates, Cq is a cone of angle α = 2π/q with
ρ = 2 tanh
apex at y = ∞, equipped with the Riemannian metric

Figure 3: Elliptic degeneration of q1 and q2

As the order q goes to inﬁnity, or equivalently as the angle α goes to zero, the cone Cq turns into
the cusp C∞ with metric given by

ds2∞ =

dx2 + dy2

y2

.

To turn several cones into cusps, we proceed as follows. Let q = (q1, q2,··· , qm) be a vector of
the orders of elliptic ﬁxed points. In this case we deﬁne Cq = ∪m
k=1Cqk . We similarly deﬁne Cq,ε
as a union over the components of q. We say that the vector q approaches inﬁnity if and only
if each of its components approach inﬁnity. Consequently, the Riemannian manifold Cq (with m
connected components) converges to m copies of the limit Riemannian manifold C∞ as q → ∞.
Similarly, Cq,ε converges to m copies of C∞,ε. We shall write these limits as m×C∞ and m×C∞,ε.

With these in mind, let us make the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 1.1. A family of ﬁnite volume hyperbolic surfaces Mq parametrized by the m-vector q
will be called an elliptically degenerating surface if it has the following properties (see Fig. 3):

a) For any ε < 1/2, the surface Cq,ε (with m components) embeds isometrically into Mq.
b) As q → ∞, Mq converges to a complete, hyperbolic surface M∞ in the following sense. The
surface M∞ contains m embedded copies of C∞,ε which is the limit of Cq,ε ⊂ Mq. The geometry
of Mq\Cq,ε converges to the geometry of M∞\(m × C∞,ε).

Remark 1.2. In the above deﬁnition, m × C∞,ε refers to the “new” cusps of M∞, that is, the
cusps which developed from degeneration.
In particular, for every q, it is possible to identify
points x(q) and y(q) on Mq\Cq,ε such that limq→∞ dq(x(q), y(q)) = d∞(x(∞), y(∞)). Henceforth,
we shall suppress the q dependence of points which are identiﬁed during degeneration and simply
write x and y. The volume forms induced by the converging metrics also converge uniformly on
Mq\Cq,ε, and all such measures are absolutely continuous with respect to each other. In general,
the hyperbolic volume form occurring in an integral will be denoted by dµ with an appropriate
subscript when needed (for example, dµq). Length measure will be denoted by dρ.

The description of the degeneration of Mq to the limit surface M∞ also applies to the degen-
eration of Cq and Cq,δ (with ε < δ) to their limit surfaces, m × C∞ and m × C∞,δ respectively.

The next result is the main theorem of [Ju 98].

α ∈(cid:2)0, 2π(1 − χ(M ))(cid:1), let gα be the unique hyperbolic metric on M such that (E, gα) is a hyper-

Proposition 1.3. Let M be a surface with Euler characteristic χ(M ), having one conical neigh-
borhood E. Let [g] be a pointwise conformal class of hyperbolic metrics on M . For each number
bolic cone of angle α. Deﬁne the conformal factor wα : M (cid:55)→ R where gα = ewα g0. Then the map
α (cid:55)→ wα ∈ C∞(M ) is real analytic.
Idea of proof. Consider hyperbolic metrics g on M for which (E, g) embeds into (S1 × (0,∞), mα),
where the Riemannian metric is given by

mα =

dθ2 + dy2

α−2 sinh2(αy)

,

7

that is an inﬁnite volume hyperbolic cone of angle α.

By the Gauss-Bonnet formula and the negativity of the curvature, it follows that α − 2π +
2πχ(M ) < 0 . In [McO 88], the author shows that this inequality implies the existence of such a
metric g which is determined by its conformal structure and the angle α. This gives a bijection

between the interval(cid:2)0, 2π(1−χ(M ))(cid:1) and the set of conical hyperbolic metrics in a given conformal

class, by sending α to gα .

Fix an angle α0 in the above interval. Consider the conformal factor wα : M (cid:55)→ R , satisfying
gα = e2wα gα0 . The map wα is then part of the zero set of a carefully chosen elliptic second order
diﬀerential operator between Banach spaces whose Frechet derivative has bounded inverse. The
implicit function theorem between Banach spaces is the used to show that the map α (cid:55)→ wα is
real analytic.

Remark 1.4. The above proposition states that given a ﬁnite volume hyperbolic surface M∞
with p cusps, there exists a family of hyperbolic surfaces {Mq}, with p − m cusps indexed by the
m-tuple q such that

q→∞ Mq = M∞

2 Regularized heat traces

In this section we establish integral representations for the hyperbolic and elliptic heat traces
for complex valued time. We then deﬁne what we call a regularized trace of the heat kernel. If the
hyperbolic Riemann surface is compact, then the regularized trace must agree with the trace of
the heat kernel. The non-compact case comes with parabolic elements whose contribution to the
trace is unbounded. In such case, we need to subtract the contribution of the parabolic elements,
i.e. to regularize the trace of the heat kernel. The section ends with two remarks. The ﬁrst remark
relates our expression for the elliptic heat trace with the expression that is most common in the
literature ([Ku 73], [He 76].) The second remark presents in brief how the results in this section
lead to the Selberg trace formula. The staples of this section are the periodization of the heat
kernel on a hyperbolic Riemann surface of ﬁnite volume together with the integral expression for
the heat kernel in the upper half plane.

Let ∆M denote the Laplace operator on the surface M . Consider the heat operator ∆M + ∂t
acting on functions f : M × R+ (cid:55)→ R which are C 2(M ) and C 1(R+). Then the heat kernel
associated to M is the minimal integral kernel which inverts the heat operator. Namely, the heat
kernel is a function KM : R × M × M (cid:55)→ R satisfying the following conditions. For any bounded
function f ∈ C 2(M ) consider the integral transform

(cid:90)

u(t, x) =

KM (t, x, y)f (y)dµM (y) .

Then the following diﬀerential and initial time conditions are met

M

∆xu + ∂tu = 0 and f (x) = lim
t→0+

u(t, x) .

In this paper we consider hyperbolic surfaces having conical singularities (see [Ju 95]), surfaces
realized as the action of discrete groups Γ of PSL(2, R) acting on H. The conical singularities are
present once the group Γ contains elements (other than the identity) having ﬁxed points. Such
is the case with the full modular group PSL(2, Z) . In particular, let M be a compact hyperbolic
surface, having n marked points {ci}n
i=1. The Riemannian metric g on M is called conically singular
hyperbolic metric if and only if for every i = 1, .., n there exists a chart (Ui, µi) about the point
ci isometrically mapping Ui to a hyperbolic cone model with associated angle αi. The metric g
induces a compatible complex structure on M\{ci}n
i=1,
provide a complex structure on M . Given such structure, there exist a unique complete hyperbolic
metric on M\{ci}n

i=1 and together with the charts {(Ui, µi)}n

i=1 for which each ci is a cusp.

As the surfaces in consideration have conical points, there is a way to extend the domain
on which the Laplace operator acts so that it is self-adjoint. The Friedrichs procedure is one

8

(cid:90)

(cid:27)

(cid:26)

(cid:90)

such possible extension and we use it here for our spectral purposes. Namely, the domain of the
extension is the closure in L2(M ) of the space

D =

f ∈ L2(M ) :

(< gradf, gradf > +f 2)dµ < ∞ and

f dµ = 0

M

∂cusp

where dµ denotes the hypebolic volume form and the domain of integration for the second integral
is a horocycle. For details of the above construction we refer the reader to [LP 76], [CdV 83],
[Ju 95], and [Ji 94]. Throughout this paper, we will refer to the pseudo-Laplacian above as simply
the Laplace operator.

If M is compact, then the spectrum of the (non-negative) Laplace operator is discrete, con-
sisting of eigenvalues 0 = λ0 < λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ → ∞ counted with multiplicity. Associated to these
eigenvalues there is complete system {φn(x)}∞
n=0 of orthonormal eigenfunction of the Laplace
operator on M. For t > 0 and x, y ∈ M , the heat kernel has the following realization

KM (t, x, y) =

e−λntφn(x)φn(y) ,

(2.1)

∞(cid:88)

n=0

and the sum converges uniformly on [t0,∞) × M × M for ﬁxed t0 > 0 (see for instance [Ch 84].)
If M is not compact, the spectrum has a discrete part as well as a continuous part in the real
interval [1/4,∞]. The continuos spectrum comes from the parabolic Eisenstein series Epar;M,P (s, z)
associated to the each cusp P of M . In such case, the spectral expansion has the following form

Let KH(t, ˜x, ˜y) denote the heat kernel on the upper half plane. Recall that KH(t, ˜x, ˜y) is a

KH(t, ˜x, ˜y) = KH(t, dH(˜x, ˜y)).

For any hyperbolic Riemann surface M (cid:39) Γ\H, one can express the heat kernel as a periodiza-
tion of the heat kernel of the hyperbolic plane. Let x and y denote points on M with lifts ˜x and
˜y to H. Then we can write the heat kernel on M as

KM (t, x, y) =

KH(t, dH(˜x, γ ˜y)).

γ∈Γ

Denote by H(Γ), P (Γ), and E(Γ) complete sets of Γ-inconjugate primitive hyperbolic, parabolic,
and elliptic elements, respectively, of the group Γ. If M is compact, then P (Γ) is empty. Let Γγ
denote the centralizer of γ ∈ Γ. If γ is a hyperbolic or a parabolic element then Γγ is isomorphic
to the inﬁnite cyclic group. If γ is elliptic then its centralizer is isomorphic to the ﬁnite cyclic
group of order qγ. In each instance, the centralizer is generated by a primitive element. We can
use elementary theory of Fuchsian groups (see for instance [McK 72]) and decompose the group
Γ into conjugacy classes as follows. Given any hyperbolic or parabolic element η, there exist a
primitive element γ in H(Γ) or P (Γ) respectively, and a unique positive integer n, such that η
belongs to the conjugacy class {κ−1γnκ : κ ∈ Γγ\Γ}. For a given elliptic element η, there exist a
primitive element γ ∈ E(Γ) and a unique integer 1 ≤ n < qγ, such that η belongs to the conjugacy
class {κ−1γnκ : κ ∈ Γγ\Γ}. With these in mind, we can write the periodization (2.5) as

The combination of (2.7) and (2.8) represent an instance of the Selberg trace formula as applied
to the function f (r) = e−tr2

and its Fourier transform ˆf (u) = (4πt)−1/2e−u2/4t.

One can use this special case to generalize the trace formula to a larger class of functions.
First, denote by rn the solutions to λn = 1/4 + r2
n. The non-negativity of the eigenvalues imply
that for each n there are two solutions rn which are either opposite real numbers or complex
conjugate numbers in the segment [−i/2, i/2] .
To continue, let h(t) be any measurable function for which h(t)e(1/4+ε)t is in L1(R) for some
ε > 0 . Multiply the right-hand side of (2.7) and (2.8) by h(t)et/4 and integrate from 0 to ∞ with
respect to t. Set

By rewriting the absolute integrand of H(r) as |h(t)e(1/4+ε)t)| · |e−(r2+1/4+ε)t)| and recalling the
imposed conditions on h(t), it easily follows that H(r) is analytic inside the horizontal strip
|Im(r)| ≤ 1/2 + ε(cid:48) for some ε(cid:48) > 0 depending on ε . The Fourier transform of H(r) has the form

Putting these facts together yields the Selberg trace formula in the compact case, namely

with the formula in Theorem 5.1 of [He 76], with χ being the trivial character of the group Γ.

In the case M is non-compact, the regularized trace equals the trace of the heat kernel minus
the contribution of the parabolic conjugacy classes. While the geometric side of the regularized
trace is precisely as in (2.8), the spectral side has the following presentation

3 Results from spectral theory and the heat equation

In this section we present various bounds on the heat kernel associated to the degenerating
family. As we will see, these bounds turn out to be independent of the family parameter q as well
as the imaginary part of the time variable z. In the process, we will also deﬁne and analyze the
Poisson kernel subject to Dirichlet condition on the hyperbolic cone of ﬁnite volume Cq,δ, as this
Poisson kernel can be realized as a normal derivative of the heat kernel on the ﬁnite volume cone.

The ﬁrst two propositions of this section yield bounds which are independent of q.

Proposition 3.1. Let Rq denote either a ﬁnite volume degenerating hyperbolic surface Mq or an
inﬁnite volume degenerating hyperbolic cone Cq. Then the spectral expansion for the heat kernel
on Rq converges in the topology of smooth functions on compact sets. That is, every derivative in
the space variables converges uniformly on compact sets.

Proof. If the surface Rq is compact, then the spectral expansion of the heat kernel has the following

for an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions {φn,q} with corresponding eigenvalues {λn,q}. Proposi-
tion 20.1 of [Sh 87] (see also [Ch 84] pp. 139 - 140) shows that the series above converges smoothly
on compact subsets of R+ × Rq × Rq.

In the non-compact case, let {Ωm,q} be a compact exhaustion of Rq. The heat kernel subject to
Dirichlet boundary conditions on Ωm,q converges smoothly to the heat kernel on Mq (see [Ch 84]
starting on p. 187). Proposition 20.1 of [Sh 87] makes use of Theorem 7.6 in [Sh 87] (Sobolev
imbedding theorem compact case). Replacing the latter result by Corollary 7.11 in [GT 83], allows
to extend Proposition 20.1 of [Sh 87] to the Dirichlet heat kernel on Ωm,q. This in turn implies that
spectral expansion of the heat kernel subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on Ωm,q converges
smoothly.
Proposition 3.2. Let Mq be a compact degenerating surface. Let ε < δ, x ∈ ∂Cq,ε, and ζ ∈ ∂Cq,δ.
∂n,x will denote the normal derivative on ∂Cq,ε with respect to the variable x. For t in a compact
interval not containing 0, there exists a number C independent of q and t such that for all s ∈ R,
we have the following bounds.

2|KMq (t + is, x, ζ)| ≤ KMq (t, x, x) + KMq (t, ζ, ζ) ≤ C

Our next task is to deﬁne the Poisson kernel on the hyperbolic cone Cq,δ associated to an

elliptic representative of order q.

Deﬁnition 3.3. Let K D
be the Dirichlet heat kernel on the hyperbolic domain Cq,δ. For any
point ζ ∈ ∂Cq,δ, denote by ∂n,ζ the inward normal derivative. The Poisson kernel Pq,δ(t, x, ζ) of
the hyperbolic domain Cq,δ is deﬁned by

Cq,δ

Pq,δ(t, x, ζ) = ∂n,ζK D

Cq,δ

(t, x, ζ).

Remark 3.4. From the Theorem 5 on page 168 of [Ch 84], we have the following description of
the Poisson kernel. The function Pq,δ(t, x, ζ) is an integral kernel for t > 0 with x ∈ Cq,δ and
ζ ∈ ∂Cq,δ, which solves the following boundary value problem. Let u = u(t, x) satisfy

(∆ − ∂t)u = 0
u(0, x) = 0

u(t, ζ) = f (t, ζ)

for ζ ∈ ∂Cq,δ. Then

(cid:90) t

u(t, x) =

Pq,δ(t − σ, x, ζ)f (σ, ζ)dρ(ζ)dσ

where dρ(ζ) represents the line element on the boundary of Cq,δ.

The following lemma establishes various estimates for the Poisson kernel which are independent

of q.

17

Proposition 3.5. Let Cq be a family of inﬁnite volume hyperbolic cones. For any δ > 0, any
0 < ε < δ, and any real values t0, t1 > 0, the following results hold.
(a) For all 0 < t ≤ t1, x ∈ Cq,ε, and ζ ∈ ∂Cq,δ, there is a constant M independent of q such that

0 ≤ Pq,δ(t, x, ζ) ≤ M.

(b) For all t0 ≤ t ≤ t1, x ∈ Cq,δ, and ζ ∈ ∂Cq,δ, there is a constant M independent of q such that

(c) For ﬁxed s, the L2-norm (cid:107) Pq,δ(t + is,·, ζ) (cid:107)2;Cq,δ is decreasing in t.

0 ≤ Pq,δ(t, x, ζ) ≤ M.

Proof. The proof follows the template given in Proposition 2.3 of [JoLu 97a] with some minor
changes which we now present.

The Dirichlet heat kernel is non-negative for all values of the parameters and equal to zero when
either x or ζ lie on the boundary of the cone Cq,δ. In turn, the diﬀerence quotient whose limit is
the Poisson kernel, is a limit of non-negative functions, so that the Poisson kernel is non-negative.
This proves the lower bounds in parts a) and b).

To prove part (c), we break up the Poisson kernel as u + iv for real valued functions u and v.

With s ∈ R ﬁxed and ζ ∈ ∂Cq,δ we can write

where in the last equality we use Green’s theorem as applied to functions that vanish on the
boundary of Cq,δ.

It remains to consider the upper bounds in part (a) and (b). In the process, we will show that
the Poisson kernel is bounded above by the normal derivative of the Dirichlet heat kernel. Recall
from Section 1, that a fundamental domain for the ﬁnite volume hyperbolic cone Cq,δ is given by
the following subset of the hyperbolic unit disc,
F = {ρeiθ ∈ D : 0 ≤ ρ < cosh

−1(1 + δq/2π), 0 ≤ θ < 2π/q}.

F denote the Dirichlet heat kernel of the domain F. Given a point ˜ζ on the boundary of
Let K D
F, there is a unique geodesic g (which depends on the choice of point and fundamental domain)
tangent to the boundary of F at ˜ζ. The geodesic g separates the hyperbolic unit disc into two
components. Denote by V the component containing the fundamental domain F (see Fig. 4).
Associated to this component we have the Poisson kernel which we denote by K D
V . Using the
isotropy subgroup for Cq and the deﬁnition of the Poisson kernel, we can write

Pq,δ(t, x, ζ) = ∂n,ζK D

Cq,δ

(t, x, ζ) = ∂n,˜ζ

K D

F (t, exp(2πik/q)˜x, ˜ζ).

(3.5)

Let p : R → D be the unique geodesic parametrized by arclength deﬁned by the following con-
ditions: p(0) = ˜ζ, p is perpendicular to g at ˜ζ, and p(R+) ⊂ V. Since F ⊂ V, we have that
F ≤ K D

Because the boundary of V is a geodesic (namely g), the method of images implies the equality

V (t, ˜x, p(h)) = KD(t, ˜x, p(h)) − KD(t, ˜x, p(−h)).
K D

From this and equation (3.6), we can write

Diﬀerentiating the sum in (3.5) we obtain the inequality

Pq,δ(t, x, ζ) ≤ 2∂n,˜ζ

KD(t, exp(2πik/q)˜x, ˜ζ) ≤ 2∂n,˜ζKCq (t, x, ζ) .

If x and ζ are bounded away form each other, inequality (3.7) and the limit (5.2) of Theorem 5.2
imply that (3.7) is uniformly convergent as q → ∞ for 0 < t ≤ t1, proving the upper bound in
part (a) of the proposition. On the other hand, if x ∈ Cq,δ and ζ ∈ ∂Cq,δ, the limit (5.2) again
implies that (3.7) converges uniformly for 0 < t1 ≤ t ≤ t2, proving the upper bound in part (b) of
the proposition.
Lemma 3.6. Let z = t + is with ﬁxed t. Let x ∈ Cq,δ and suppose that f (z, x) is a C 2 function
for which (∂z − ∆x)f (z, x) = 0. Write f = u + iv for some real-valued functions u and v. Then
we have

Corollary 3.7. For ﬁxed t > 0 and ζ ∈ ∂Cq,δ, the L2-norm
(cid:107) Pq,δ(t + is,·, ζ) (cid:107)2;Cq,δ

is constant in s.
Proof. For ﬁxed ζ ∈ ∂Cq,δ, deﬁne

f (t + is, x) = Pq,δ(t + is, x, ζ)

and apply the previous lemma. Note that the Poisson kernel vanishes at boundary values, so that
the integrand in the previous lemma is identically zero.

Lemma 3.8.
(a) Let 0 < ε < δ < 1/2, and t0 ≥ 0. There exists a number C independent of q such that for

0 ≤ t ≤ t0

|KMq − KCq|(t, x, ζ) ≤ C

sup
x∈Cq,ε
ζ∈∂Cq,δ

(b) Let 0 < ε < δ. For ﬁxed t > 0 and ζ ∈ ∂Cq,δ,

(cid:107) (KMq − KCq )(t + is,·, ζ) (cid:107)2;Cq,ε≤ C(cid:112)1 + |s|

Proof. The inclusion of the fundamental groups gives the lower bound

(KMq − KCq )(t, x, ζ) ≥ 0.

The function (KMq − KCq )(t, x, ζ) is a solution to the heat equation in t and x on the domain Cq,ε
with zero initial data. By applying the maximum principle and the positivity of the heat kernel
KCq as in Lemma 5.3, we can write

(KMq − KCq )(t, x, ζ) ≤ sup
z∈∂Cq,ε
w∈∂Cq,ε
0≤τ≤t

KMq (τ, z, w).

Using the above inequality together with the ﬁrst bound in Proposition 3.2 we complete part (a)
of this lemma.

To prove part (b), ﬁrst note that from part (a) we have that the sup norm is bounded. Con-

sequently, the L2 norm is bounded and we can write

for some C1 independent of q. We then substitute (KMq − KCq )(t, x, ζ) for f in the statement of
Lemma 3.6 and use the bounds in Proposition 3.2 to write

≤ C1 + C2|s|.

We complete the proof by taking the square root.

4 Analysis of elliptic heat trace

In this section, we estimate the trace of the heat kernel on the hyperbolic cone Cq both over
all of Cq as well as over the truncated conical region Cq\Cq,δ . The main technical computation
is Proposition 4.1, which is analogous to Theorem 3.1 of [JoLu 97a]. The remainder of the section
states corollaries which we derive from Proposition 4.1.

Proof. This ﬁrst part of the proof (up to the integral representation given in the equation (4.1))
follows the very same ideas as in the computation of the elliptic heat trace presented in Theorem
2.5. However, since this is a rather technical proposition, we will present it in detail.

The domain of integration can be modeled by the region in H described by

{(ρ, θ) : r(δ, q) ≤ ρ < ∞, 0 ≤ θ < 2π} where r(δ, q) = cosh

−1(1 + qδ/2π).

In these coordinates, write any x ∈ H as x = (ρ, θ) and, referring to (1.4), let
−1(1 + 2 sin2(πn/q) sinh2(ρ)).

a(n, q, ρ) = d(x, γn

q x) = cosh

In these coordinates, the integrand under consideration depends solely on ρ. Therefore, we are
studying the explicit expression

Combining (4.4) and (4.5) completes the proof of the proposition.

Remark 4.2. It is interesting to compare the bound obtained in Proposition 4.1 (elliptic degen-
eration) with the bound given in Theorem 3.1 of [JoLu 97a] (hyperbolic degeneration). When
doing so, one sees a remarkable similarity between the upper bounds, which one would expect in
some philosophical level. However, structurally, one can make a more precise comparison between
the two results. As in [JoLu 97a], our results rely on the coeﬃcient of the special value of the
Riemann zeta function. When comparing Theorem 3.1 of [JoLu 97a] and Proposition 4.1 above,
we need to keep in mind that the domain of integration in the setting of hyperbolic degeneration
of [JoLu 97a] consists of two integrals, whereas in elliptic degeneration there is one component.
Furthermore, one could easily modify the expressions involving δ in Theorem 3.1 of [JoLu 97a] so
that they match their counterparts here. As we will see, the additive factor next to the zeta value
present here (but not in [JoLu 97a]), will play a signiﬁcant role in the behavior of the trace near
t = 0.

The result follows by taking δ = 0 in the integral representation given by the equation (4.1). The
integral above is one of the terms (corresponding to one elliptic ﬁxed point) in the elliptic heat
trace formula as detailed in Theorem 2.5.

Corollary 4.4. Let z = t + is with t > 0. Then the following bounds and limits hold uniformly
in q.

(a) There is a constant C (depending on δ, t, and the number of degenerating elliptic elements)

such that

(b) The following limit holds

Proof. For part (a), the quantity above is a sum of integrals over Cqk\Cqk,δ for each qk ∈ q. Recall
that ζQ(1 + ε) ∼ ε−1 for ε near 0, so then the result follows immediately from Proposition 4.1.
Part (b) follows directly by inspection from Proposition 4.1.

Part (c) estimates the integral (II) in Theorem 5.4. For simplicity, we can work with one
degenerating cone whose order is q. Choose δ such that ε < δ < 1/2. For any x, y ∈ Cq,ε with y
ﬁxed, we can use the Poisson kernel to write

The L2-norm above is constant in s, by Corollary 3.7, and decreasing in t, by Proposition 3.5 part

By combining (4.6),(4.7), and (4.8) we complete the proof of part (c) of this corollary.

It remains to prove part (d). In this direction, note that integrals A and C from part (c) lines
ε. Since z = t + is is ﬁxed, we can improve the bound of
ε. Let σ = a + ib with a > 0. Then

(4.6) and (4.8) depend explicitly on
integral B, namely we can show that integral B depends on

√

|(KMq − KCq )(σ, x, y)| ≤ exp(b2/4a)a3/2(a2 + b2)3/4(KMq − KCq )(τ, x, y)

where τ = (a2 + b2)/a. For |b| ≤ |s|, the right hand side is bounded independent of q according to
Lemma 3.8 part (a). The supremum bound leads to the L2-bound

(cid:113)

which holds for the relevant range of b. With this bound, we carry on as in (4.7) and obtain that
integral B is also dependent on

Lemma 4.5. For ﬁxed t > 0, the integral

|(KMq − KH)(t + is, x, x)|dµ(x)

is bounded as a function of s, independently of q.

Proof. From Proposition 3.2 part (a), the above integral can be bounded from above by

KMq (t, x, x)dµ(x) + vol(Mq\Cq,ε)KH(z, 0).

(4.9)

Using the periodization of the heat kernel, we can rewrite the integrand in (4.9) as a Stieltjes
integral

KMq (t, x, x) =

KH(t, dH(˜x, γ ˜x) =

KH(t, ρ) dNΓq (x; ρ)

where NΓq (x; ρ) counts the number of geodesics about x whose length is bounded above by ρ.
Directly from (2.3), we obtain the following bound

KMq (t, x, x) ≤ 100e−t/4

KMq (t, x, x) ≤ Ce−t/4

(4πt)3/2

.

(4.10)

As far as the volume term, denote by g the genus of the family (which is independent of the
degeneration parameter q) and by κ the number of all cusps and cones of the family (which also
stays constant). Then we can write

vol(Mq) ≤ 2π(2g − 2 + κ).

(4.11)

Additionally, from (2.4) which we extend here to complex time, we obtain the following bound

|KH(z, 0)| ≤ e−t/4

(cid:90)

5 Convergence of regularized heat traces

In this section we will make use of the estimates from previous sections to prove the convergence
through elliptic degeneration of the regularized trace of the heat kernel on the Mq to the regularized
trace on the limiting surface M∞. The trace of the heat kernel alone diverges through degeneration
since the degenerating elliptic elements converge to cusps in the limiting surface. The result applies
to elliptically degenerating families Mq of ﬁnite volume, both in the compact and non-compact
case. The convergence has a dual aspect, on the one hand pointwise and on the other hand uniform
with respect to the time variable.

We start by deﬁning the degenerating trace of the heat kernel. Let Mq be a degenerating
sequence of connected, hyperbolic Riemann surface of ﬁnite volume having limiting surface M∞.
This means that each surface in the family is realized as Γq\H. Let DE(Γq) denote the subset of
E(Γq) consisting of the inconjugate primitive elliptic elements associated to the conical points we
wish to degenerate into cusps. We deﬁne the degenerating heat trace via the integral

Proof. One can use the same arguments as in the proof of Theorem 2.5.

The next result presents the behavior through degeneration of the heat kernel and its deriva-
tives. Namely, we have the following theorem. For brevity, we only state the result. For details,
we refer the reader to [JoLu 95] and Theorem 1.3 of [JoLu 97a] which one can easily adapt to the
elliptic degeneration setting.

27

Theorem 5.2. Let Rq denote either Mq or Cq. For i = 1, 2, let νi = νi(q) be a tangent vector of
unit length based at xi ∈ Rq which converges as q → ∞. Denote by ∂νi,xi the directional derivative
with respect to the variable xi in the direction νi. Assume that either x1 or x2 is not a degenerating
conical point. Then

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

(a) Let A be a bounded set in the complex plane with inf z∈A Re(z) > 0. For any ε > 0, the

convergence is uniform on A × Rq\Cq,ε × Rq\Cq,ε.

(b) We deﬁne Dε,ε(cid:48) to be an ε(cid:48) neighborhood of the diagonal of Rq\Cq,ε × Rq\Cq,ε. That is,

Dε,ε(cid:48) = {(x1, x2) ∈ Rq\Cq,ε × Rq\Cq,ε : d(x1, x2) < ε(cid:48)}

Let B be a bounded set in the complex plane with inf z∈B Re(z) ≥ 0. For any ε > 0 and ε(cid:48) > 0,
the convergence is uniform on B × ((Rq\Cq,ε × Rq\Cq,ε)\Dε,ε(cid:48)).

In the course of the proof of the main result of this section, we analyze the behavior of three
integrals. These integrals represent the regularized trace of the heat kernel from which we exclude
the identity term.
In other words, these integrals amount the contribution to the regularized
trace of the hyperbolic and elliptic heat traces minus the contribution of the degenerating elliptic
trace. We will only look at the compact case. The adaptation of the Lemma 5.3 below to the
non-compact case should immediately follow.
Lemma 5.3. Let M = Γ\H be a compact connected hyperbolic surface, having m degenerating
elliptic elements. Then for every suﬃciently small ε, we have

where ETrKM (t+is) and DTrKM (t+is) denote the contribution to the trace of the non-degenerating
and degenerating elliptic elements respectively.

Proof. The formal aspect of the above equality follows from the derivation of the group sum side
of the Selberg trace formula (in particular, see [McK 72]). For clarity, we give a proof below (see
also [DJ 98]).

For simplicity, we will assume that m = 1, i.e. only one conical end degenerates. We will drop
m from notations and to further simplify matters, we will work with real time traces. Using the
periodization of the heat kernel on M allows us to write

HKM (t, x) + EKM (t, x) − DKM (t, x) = KM (t, x, x) − DKM (t, x) − KH(t, 0).

It follows that

since the sum of the integral in the fourth equality above unfolds to Γγ\H which represents the
inﬁnite cone Cq. This proves the case for one degenerating elliptic element and easily generalizes
to several degenerating elements. This completes the proof of the formal aspect of the lemma.

We need to show ﬁniteness for all t > 0. The proof is similar to Theorem 1.1 of [JoLu 97b]. In
particular this will imply that the right hand side of the equation in the statement of the lemma is
independent of the choice of ε. That the ﬁrst and third integrals are bounded follows from Lemma
4.5 and Proposition 4.1 respectively.

It remains to establish the ﬁniteness of the second integral. We will prove this by two applica-

tions of the maximum principle ([Ch 84] page 180). Consider the following function

D(t, x, y) = KM (t, x, y) − KCq (t, x, y).

Fix y in some conical neighborhood Cq,ε of the surface M . Observe that D(t, x, y) satisﬁes the heat
equation with respect to the x and t. Fix some ε0 > ε, so that all conical points have hyperbolic
neighborhoods of area equal to ε0. Using the maximum principle, the function D(t, x, y) attains
its maximum when x lies on the boundary of the conical neighborhood Cq,ε0. Note that y is
contained Cq,ε which lies inside the enveloping conical neighboorhood Cq,ε0 . Using the maximum

Standard bounds for the heat kernel ([Ch 84] page 198) and equation (5.7) provide upper and
lower bounds for the function D(t, x, y). Thus the second integral in the statement of the lemma
can be made arbitrarily small since both the integrand as well as the domain of integration can
be made arbitrarily small.

We remark here that the lower bounds in (5.6) and (5.7) can be improved trivially to zero com-
bining (2.5) with the observation that the fundamental group of Cq embeds into the fundamental
group of M .

The following theorem is the principal result of this section as well as one of the main tools
used in this paper. For instance, this type of regularized convergence will be used to show the
convergence in the context of elliptic degeneration of the spectral weighted counting functions, the
Selberg zeta function, the spectral zeta function, as well as other functions such as the Poisson
kernel, the wave kernel, and the resolvent kernel. With these remarks in mind, we state the
following theorem.

Theorem 5.4. Let Mq denote an elliptically degenerating family of compact or non-compact
hyperbolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume converging to the non-compact hyperbolic surface
M∞.

(a) (Pointwise) For ﬁxed z = t + is with t > 0, we have

q→∞[HTrKMq (z) + ETrKMq (z) − DTrKMq (z)] = HTrKM∞(z) + ETrKM∞ (z).

lim

(b) (Uniformity) For any t > 0, there exists a constant C such that for all s ∈ R and all q, we

have the bound

|HTrKMq (z) + ETrKMq (z) − DTrKMq (z)| ≤ C(1 + |s|)3/2.

Proof. We will prove part (a) in the case Mq is an elliptically degenerating compact family. Then
we will extend the result in the non-compact setting.

If Mq is a family of elliptically degenerated compact hyperbolic Riemann surfaces, the above

Lemma 5.3 allows us to write for suﬃciently small ε and t > 0

(HTrKMq + ETrKMq − DTrKMq )(t + is) =

As q goes to inﬁnity, Theorem 5.2 part (a) implies that the integrand in (I) converges uniformly
on compact subsets of Mq bounded away from the developing cusps and the cones corresponding
to elliptic elements. On such compact sets, the metric converges uniformly. Since the domain of
integration is compact, we get that

q→∞(I) =
lim

(KM∞ − KH)(z, x, x)dµ(x).

Integral (II) corresponds to the integral over C∞,ε. Using Corollary 4.4 part (d) for a small

choice of ε, we can make integral (II) arbitrarily small.

It remains to consider integral (III). In this direction, choose δ > ε and break down integral

[KCq − KH](z, x, x)dµ(x) =

[KCq − KH](z, x, x)dµ(x)

[KCq − KH](z, x, x)dµ(x).

(5.8)

From Theorem 5.2 part (a), we have that the integrand of (III) converges uniformly in q. Since
the domain Cq,δ\Cq,ε is compact, we have that

[KCq − KH](z, x, x)dµ(x) =

[KC∞ − KH](z, x, x)dµ(x),

C∞,δ\C∞,ε

where the second integral in (5.8) can be made arbitrarily small by choosing δ small enough as in
part (b) of Corollary 4.4. This completes the proof of Theorem 5.4 part (a) in the compact case.
The non-compact version of Theorem 5.4 part (a) can be argued as follows. Suppose that
Mq = Mq,∞ has p cusps. Using Proposition 1.3, the surface Mq,∞ can be realized as the limit
of an elliptically degenerating family of compact hyperbolic surfaces Mq,p having m + p conical
points, by degenerating p cones into cusps. The compact case of Theorem 5.4 part (a) applies:
For every ﬁxed q, we have

p→∞ HtrKMq,p (z) + EtrKMq,p(z) − DtrKMq,p(z) = HtrKMq,∞(z) + EtrKMq,∞ (z) .

lim

The compact case of Theorem 5.4 also applies to the family Mq,p when we let q and p go simul-
taneously to inﬁnity:

q,p→∞ HtrKMq,p(z) + EtrKMq,p(z) − DtrKMq,p(z) = HtrKM∞,∞(z) + EtrKM∞,∞ (z) .

lim

Having showed that for each q a limit as p → ∞ exists and that a limit exists when q, p → ∞
simultaneously, we conclude that

q→∞ HtrKMq,∞ (z) + EtrKMq,∞(z) − DtrKMq,∞ (z) = HtrKM∞,∞ (z) + EtrKM∞,∞(z) .

lim

We will prove part (b) of Theorem 5.4, by ﬁrst treating the compact case and then extend the
proof to the non-compact case. From Lemma 4.5 we have that integral (I) is O(1), independent
of q. Integrals (II) and (III) are both O(s3/2) independent of q according to Corollary 4.4 part (c)
and part (a) respectively. This proves the compact case.

To prove the non-compact case, we note that any non-compact hyperbolic surface Mq can be
realized as the limit of a compact family Mq,q(cid:48). The compact case of Theorem 5.4 part (b) applies
and we can write

|HTrKMq,q(cid:48) (z) + ETrKMq,q(cid:48) (z) − DTrKMq,q(cid:48) (z)| ≤ C(1 + |s|)3/2

where the bound is independent of q and q(cid:48) and the constant C is independent of the limiting
surface. By letting q(cid:48) go to inﬁnity and applying Theorem 5.4 part (a), we can write

|HTrKMq,∞ (z) + ETrKMq,∞ (z) − DTrKMq,∞ (z)| ≤ C(1 + |s|)3/2

uniformly in q. This completes the proof.

Remark 5.5. By following the steps of Theorem 5.4 with slight modiﬁcations, we can derive the
following bound for the diﬀerence of traces. For 0 < t < 1, there is a positive constant C such
that

|HTrKMq (z) + ETrKMq (z) − DTrKMq (z)| ≤ Ct−2(1 + |s|)3/2 ,

holds. To do so, we need to revisit integrals (I) through (III) from Theorem 5.4. For integral (I),
Lemma 4.5 gives the upper bound Ct−3/2. Looking back to formulas (4.6) through (4.8) in the
proof of Corollary 4.4 part (c), we see that Ct(1 + |s|)3/2 provides an upper bound for integral
(II). For integral (III), we start by splitting it as

(KCq − KH)(t, x, x)dµ(x) =

(KCq − KH)(t, x, x)dµ(x)

|III.2| ≤

(KMq − KH)(t, x, x)dµ(x) ≤ Ct(1 + |s|)3/2.

As a consequence of Theorem 5.4 part (a), we have the following corollary, which described

the small time asymptotic behavior for the regularized trace of the heat kernel.

Corollary 5.6. Let Mq denote an elliptically degenerated family of compact or non-compact hy-
perbolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume which converges to the non-compact hyperbolic surface
M∞. Then for any ﬁxed δ > 0, there exists a positive constant c such that for all 0 < t < δ, we
have

HTrKMq (t) + ETrKMq (t) − DTrKMq (t) = O

(cid:16)

t−3/2(cid:17)

uniformly in q.
Proof. As per Remark 5.5 above, integral (I) is O(t−3/2) while integrals (II) and (III.2) are O(1).
The only change is with integral (III.1) for which the special case s = 0 allows to improve its
upper bound. Namely, 2ηγ = γ/(2t) → ∞ as t (cid:38) 0; consequently ζ(1 + 2ηγ) ∼ 1 + (2ηγ)−1 and

Integrals (IV) and (V) above are the counterparts of integrals (II) and (III) respectively. The
boundedness of integral (IV) follows using similar arguments as in the case of in integral (II).
Unlike integral (III), integral (V) turns out to be bounded. Namely, we split integral (V) as

2, ε}. The second integral on the right-hand side above is over compact domain.

Theorem 5.4 part (a) shows that the hyperbolic heat trace plus the elliptic heat trace minus
the degenerating heat trace converges pointwise to the hyperbolic heat trace plus the elliptic heat
trace on the limiting surface. Through elliptic degeneration, the angles that parametrize the
degenerating cones become arbitrarily small as these cones turn into cusps. Their contribution
to the volume of Mq becomes arbitrarily small. This means the the volume of Mq converges
to the volume of the limiting surface M∞. It follows that the regularized heat trace minus the
degenerating heat trace on Mq converges pointwise to the regularized heat trace on M∞. The
corollary to Theorem 5.4 above shows uniformity of convergence near zero. We need to consider
the asymptotics for all positive t.

6 Convergence of small eigenvalues and eigenfunctions

In this section we will show the convergence of small eigenvalues and corresponding eigen-
functions through elliptic degeneration. This result is needed in the proof of Theorem 7.6. As
stated in the introduction, we will systematically develop in [GJ 16] applications of the results in
the present article to determine asymptotic behavior of various spectral functions through elliptic
degeneration.

The following theorem is the main result of this section.

Theorem 6.1. Let f be any measurable function on R+ such that there exist a vertical line t > 0
where its Laplace transform L (f )(t + is) is L1 as a function of s. Let Mq be an elliptically
degenerating family of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume which converge to the limiting
surface M∞. Let x and y be any two points which remain bounded away from the developing cusps.
For z = t + is with t > 0 and any T > 0, we have the limit

(cid:90) t+i∞

Proof. For t > 0 and any points x and y which are bounded away from the developing cusps, the
heat kernel converges uniformly. The convergence of the heat kernel (see Theorem 5.2) together
with the L1 assumption for the Laplace transform of f fulﬁll the hypotheses of the dominated
convergence theorem which we apply to conclude the proof.

Remark 6.2. For our purposes here, the function f described in Theorem 6.1 can be any function
that is continuously diﬀerentiable on R+ which vanishes at t = 0 and whose ﬁrst derivative is of
bounded variation.

Lemma 6.3. Let M be a ﬁxed hyperbolic Riemann surface of ﬁnite volume and f be a function
as described in the previous remark.

and the basic properties of the inverse Laplace transform (see [Wi 41] pages 73 and 91).

Corollary 6.4. Let Mq be a degenerating family of non-compact hyperbolic Riemann surfaces with
limiting surface M∞. Let x and y be two points bounded away from the developing cusps. Then,
for every ﬁxed T > 0, we have

We would like to apply Theorem 6.1 with f (t) = 1. However, L (f )(z) = 1/z is not L1, so we
cannot apply Theorem 6.1 directly. In order to make the statement, we need to set some notation.
So let w > 0 and deﬁne the following cumulative distribution for a hyperbolic Riemann surface M

Note that, using part (a) of Proposition 3.2, we easily obtain that the above integral converges
whenever w > 0. Furthermore, if M is compact, then

CM,w(x, T ) =

(T − λM,n)wφM,n(x)2,

and if M is non-compact

Theorem 6.5. Let Mq be a degenerating family of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces with limiting
surface M∞. Let x be a point which is bounded away from the developing cusps. Then, if 0 ≤ T <
1/4 is not an eigenvalue of M∞, we have

lim
q→∞ CMq,0(x, T ) = CM∞,0(x, T ).

35

Proof. From Theorem 6.1, we have that for weight w = 1, the following limit holds

lim
q→∞ CMq,1(x, T ) = CM∞,1(x, T ) .

To show the above limit holds for weight w = 0, we use the mean value theorem as in [JoLu 97a].

We end this section with the following corollary which states the convergence of the small

eigenfunctions.

Corollary 6.6. Let Mq be a family of elliptically degenerating compact hyperbolic Riemann sur-
faces which converges to M∞. Suppose that 0 ≤ T < 1/4 is not an eigenvalue of the limiting
surface. Then, for any point x which is bounded away from the developing cusps, we have

In particular, if the eigenspace associated to the eigenvalue λM∞,n is one-dimensional, then

lim
q→∞ φMq,n(x) = φM∞,n(x).

The convergence is uniform on compact subsets of M∞.

Proof. This follows directly from Theorem 6.5.

7 Uniform long time asymptotics

One of the results of the previous section, Corollary 5.6, presents the behavior of the regularized
trace for small values of the time variable. In this section, we continue the investigation of the
regularized trace for large values of the time variable. For all surfaces under our consideration, the
spectrum of the Laplacian is discrete below 1/4. For such a hyperbolic surface M , we denote the
eigenvalues in this range by {λM,n} and the corresponding normalized eigenfunction by {φM,n}.
The main result of this section is Theorem 7.6. Before we get to it, we need one deﬁnition and
some ancillary lemmas.

Deﬁnition 7.1. Let Mq be an elliptically degenerating family of compact or non-compact hyper-
bolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume which converge to the non-compact hyperbolic surface M∞.
Let 0 ≤ α < 1/4 be such that α is not an eigenvalue of M∞. We deﬁned the α-truncated hyperbolic
and elliptic trace by

(t) = HTrKMq (t) + ETrKMq (t) − (cid:88)

e−λq,nt.

λq,n≤α

HTrK (α)

(t) + ETrK (α)
Mq

As in the course of the proof for the behavior of the trace for small values of the time parameter,
the investigation of the long time asymptotic of the regularized trace is based on analyzing the
three three integrals as in Theorem 5.4. For integrals (I) and (III) over Mq and Cq away from
developing cusps, we need the following lemma.

Lemma 7.2. Let Rq denote either Mq or Cq, that is, either a degenerating hyperbolic surface of
ﬁnite volume or a degenerating hyperbolic cone of inﬁnite volume. For α < 1/4 and c < α, the
limit

q→∞ ectK (α)
lim

Rq

(t, x, x) = ectK (α)

R∞(t, x, x)

is uniform for x ∈ Rq\Cq,ε and t > 0.

36

Proof. To prove this lemma, we ﬁrst realize the heat kernel on Mq as a Stieltjes integral of the
periodized heat kernel in the upper-plane against geodesic counting functions. By using bounds
on the heat kernel in the upper-half plane and on the counting functions together with the uniform
convergence of the hyperbolic metrics away from the developing cusps as well as the convergence
of the small eigenvalues, the result then follows. For more details, see the proof of Lemma 3.2 of
[JoLu 97b].

Lemma 7.3. Let Mq denote an elliptically degenerating family of compact or non-compact hy-
perbolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume which converge to the non-compact hyperbolic surface
M∞. Let c < α < 1/4 and ε < 1/2. Then there is a constant C such that for all t > 0, we have

|K (α)

(t, x, y) − K (α)

Cq

sup

x∈∂Cq,ε

bound

|KMq (t, x, y) − KCq (t, x, y)| ≤ C.

(7.1)

sup

x∈∂Cq,ε
y∈∂Cq,ε

We also remark that 1/4 is a lower bound for the bottom of the spectrum for both the inﬁnite
volume cylinder C∞ and the inﬁnite volume cone Cq. Consequently, since α < 1/4, it follows that
K (α)
(t, x, y) = KCq (t, x, y). The triangle inequality allows us to
write

C∞(t, x, y) = KC∞(t, x, y) and K (α)

where the collection {λn} is the ﬁnite set of eigenvalues of M∞ in the range [0, α) Now apply the
sup over x, y ∈ ∂Cq,ε and use the bound as in (7.1) to complete the proof.
Lemma 7.4. Let f (t, x) be a solution to the Dirichlet heat problem on the ﬁnite cone Cq,ε. For
ﬁxed t > 0 let (cid:107) f (t,·) (cid:107)Cq,ε,2 denote the L2-norm of f (t,·) as a function on Cq,ε. Then for all
t0, t > 0, we have

λn<α

Proof. From the deﬁnitions, we have that

(cid:107) f (t0 + t,·) (cid:107)2;Cq,ε≤(cid:107) f (t0,·) (cid:107)2;Cq,ε e−t/4.

The last inequality follows from the fact that λ = 1/4 is a lower bound for the bottom of the
spectrum for Cq. The result follows by integration.

Lemma 7.5. For any ε < δ, there exists a constant C such that
(cid:107) Pq,δ(t, ζ,·) (cid:107)Cq,ε,2≤ Ce−t/4.

Proof. Choose t0 small enough such that 0 < t0 < t and set t(cid:48) = t − t0. Then we can write

(cid:107) Pq,δ(t, ζ,·) (cid:107)2;Cq,ε≤ (cid:107) Pq,δ(t, ζ,·) (cid:107)2;Cq,δ =(cid:107) Pq,δ(t(cid:48) + t0, ζ,·) (cid:107)2;Cq,δ

≤ (cid:107) Pq,δ(t0, ζ,·) (cid:107)2;Cq,δ e−t(cid:48)/4

where in the last inequality we use the Lemma 7.4. Now using Proposition 3.5 we get a supremum
bound uniform in q, namely we can bound the preceding inequality above by
Pq,δ(t0, ζ, x) · vol(Cq,δ)1/2e−(t−t0)/4 ≤ c(t0)e−t/4

sup
ζ∈∂Cq,δ
x∈Cq,ε

which completes the proof.

Theorem 7.6. Let Mq be an elliptically degenerating family of compact or non-compact hyperbolic
Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume which converge to the non-compact hyperbolic surface M∞. Let
α be given according to the Deﬁnition 7.1 above. Then for any c < α, there exist a constant C
such that the bound

|HTrK (α)

Mq

(t) + ETrK (α)
Mq

(t) − DTrKMq (t)| ≤ Ce−ct

holds for all t ≥ 0 and uniformly in q.

Proof. Our proof consists of analyzing the three integrals labeled (I), (II), and (III) coming from
Theorem 5.4. For the uniformity of integral (I) we use Lemma 7.2 whereas for the integral (III) we
use Proposition 4.1. In both cases, we obtain O(e−ct). It remains to consider integral (II). In this
direction, let {λn,q} be the eigenvalues on Mq which converge to the eigenvalues on M∞ which are
less than 1/4. Let {φn,q} denote the corresponding eigenfunctions. Since the small eigenvalues
and corresponding eigenfunctions converge through degeneration (see Section 6), we have that the
sum

(cid:88)

λn,q<1/4

e−tλn,q φn,q(x)φn,q(y)

N(cid:88)

varies continuously in q as well as on the limiting surface M∞. Fix δ < 1/2 and let 0 < ε < δ. For
x, y ∈ Cq,δ and t > 0 consider the decomposition

KMq (t, x, y) − KCq (t, x, y) = u(t, x, y) + v(t, x, y) +

e−tλn,q φn,q(x)φn,q(y)

n=1

where u and v are solutions to the homogeneous heat equation in both (t, x) and (t, y) such that u
vanishes on ∂Cq,δ and has appropriate initial values, whereas v vanishes at the initial values and
has appropriate values on ∂Cq,δ.

Let α < 1/4 be such that M∞ has no eigenvalue in the interval (α, 1/4). From above, we can

write

K (α)
Mq

(t, x, y) − KCq (t, x, y) = u(t, x, y) + v(t, x, y)

and denote the left hand side of the equation above by D(α)

q

(t, x, y).

We will analyze ﬁrst the function v(t, x, y). On the one hand, the function v satisﬁes the heat

equation subject to the Dirichlet condition in the variables (t, x). For ζ ∈ ∂Cq,δ, we have that

v(t, ζ, y) = D(α)

q

(t, ζ, y) − u(t, ζ, y) = D(α)

(t, ζ, y) = f1(t, ζ)

On the other hand, v satisﬁes the heat equation in the variables (t, y). Noting that for ξ ∈ ∂Cq,δ,
we have

Pq,δ(t − σ, x, ζ)D(α)

q

(σ, ζ, ξ)dρ(ζ)dσ = f2(t, ξ),

Using the supremum norm on the Dα
Lemma 7.5, and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we obtain the bound

which is clearly O(e−ct).

Next we will look at the function u(t, x, y). We will express u in terms of the Dirichlet heat
kernel on the domain Cq,. For ﬁxed y, the function u satisﬁes the heat equation in (t, x) with
zero boundary condition and initial data given by

g(x, y) =

φn,q(x)φn,q(y).

This gives the following integral representation

u(t, x, y) =

For ﬁxed x, the integral representation in (7.3) is a solution to the heat equation on Cq,δ in (t, y).
Then consider the function u(τ + t, x, y) which satisﬁes the heat equation in (τ, y), vanishes for
y ∈ ∂Cq,δ, and has initial value u(t, x, y). As such, we can write,

u(τ + t, x, y) =

(7.7)

Clearly, the above function Fδ(t) is monotone decreasing in t. Let N denote the integer that
bounds the number of eigenvalues on Mq which are less than 1/4; such a universal choice is
possible by Buser’s theorem (see page 251 of [Ch 84]). From (7.5), we deduce that Fδ(0) ≤ N .
δ(t) ≤ (−1/4)Fδ(t). We then integrate and
Since λm ≥ 1/4 for all m, we have from (7.7) that F (cid:48)
obtain

Fδ(t) ≤ Fδ(0)e−t/4.

This in turn gives

Thus we have that

(cid:90)

0 ≤ Fε(t) ≤ Fδ(t) ≤ Fδ(0)e−t/4 ≤ N e−t/4.

[u(t, x, x) + v(t, x, x)] dµ(x) = O(e−ct)

which means that integral (II) has the above bound.
