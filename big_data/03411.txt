DERIVED MORITA INVARIANCE OF

MIXED REALIZATIONS AND PERIODS

GONC¸ ALO TABUADA

Abstract. To every scheme, not necessarily smooth neither proper, we can
associate its diﬀerent mixed realizations (de Rham, Betti, ´etale, Hodge, etc) as
well as its ring of periods. In this article, following an insight of Kontsevich, we
prove that suitable modiﬁcations of these classical constructions are derived
Morita equivariant. This leads naturally to a theory of noncommutative mixed
realizations and noncommutative periods. Along the way we perform some
computations, notably in what regards diﬀerential operators.

1. Statement of results

Given a perfect ﬁeld k and a commutative Q-algebra R, Voevodsky introduced
in [51, §2] the category of geometric mixed motives DMgm(k; R). By construction,
this R-linear rigid symmetric monoidal triangulated category comes equipped with
a symmetric monoidal functor M (−)R : Sm(k) → DMgm(k; R), deﬁned on smooth
k-schemes of ﬁnite type, and with a ⊗-invertible object T := R(1)[2] called the
Tate motive. Moreover, when k is of characteristic zero, the preceding functor can
be extended from Sm(k) to the category Sch(k) of all k-schemes of ﬁnite type.
Recall from [3, §2.3.2] the construction of Voevodsky’s big category of mixed mo-
tives DM(k; R). This R-linear symmetric monoidal triangulated category admits
arbitrary direct sums and DMgm(k; R) identiﬁes with its compact objects.

A diﬀerential graded (=dg) category A, over a base ﬁeld k, is a category enriched
over complexes of k-vector spaces; see §5.1. Every (dg) k-algebra A gives naturally
rise to a dg category with a single object. Another source of examples is provided
by schemes since the category of perfect complexes of every quasi-compact quasi-
separated k-scheme X admits a canonical dg enhancement perf dg(X); see [22, §4.4].
Let us denote by dgcat(k) the category of (small) dg categories and by Hmo(k) its
localization at the class of derived Morita equivalences.

Given an R-linear symmetric monoidal additive category with arbitrary direct
sums M and a ⊗-invertible object O ∈ M, consider the commutative monoid
⊕m∈ZO⊗m in M and the associated category of (right) modules Mod(⊕mO⊗m).
In what follows, we write γ : M → Mod(⊕mO⊗m) for the base-change functor.
Deﬁnition 1.1 ((Modiﬁed) mixed realization). A mixed realization is an R-linear
lax symmetric monoidal functor H : DM(k; R) → M such that H(⊕mT⊗m) ≃
⊕mH(T)⊗m. The associated modiﬁed mixed realization is the following composition

H : Sm(k)

where (−)∨ stands for the (contravariant) duality autoequivalence.
Notation 1.2. Given X ∈ Sm(k), let us write H(X) instead of H(M (X)∨R).
Theorem 1.3. Let k be a perfect ﬁeld and R a commutative Q-algebra. Given a
mixed realization H, there exists a functor H nc making the diagram commute:

(1.4)

Sm(k)

H

/ Mod(⊕mH(T)⊗m)

Hmo(k)

.

When k is of characteristic zero, the same holds with Sm(k) replaced by Sch(k).

Intuitively speaking, Theorem 1.3 shows that as soon as we ⊗-trivialize the image
of the Tate motive H(T), the modiﬁed mixed realization H factors through perfect
complexes! This result is inspired by Kontsevich’s deﬁnition of noncommutative
´etale cohomology [25], and its proof makes essential use of the recent theory of
noncommutative (mixed) motives [40].

Corollary 1.5 (Derived Morita invariance). Let X and Y be two smooth k-schemes
of ﬁnite type and H a mixed realization. If perf dg(X) ≃ perf dg(Y ) in Hmo(k), then
H(X) ≃ H(Y ) in Mod(⊕mH(T)⊗m). When k is of characteristic zero, the same
holds without the smoothness assumption.

Remark 1.6.

(i) Consult Remark 6.16 for the construction of the additive category
Hmo0(k)R and of the functor Uadd(−)R : Hmo(k) → Hmo0(k)R. As mentioned
in loc. cit., the functor H nc factors through Uadd(−)R.

(ii) Consult §5.2 for the construction of the category of noncommutative mixed
motives Mot(k; R) and of the functor U (−)R : Hmo(k) → Mot(k; R). By con-
struction, the functor H nc factors furthermore through U (−)R; see §6.

2. Examples of (modified) mixed realizations

Let R be a ﬁeld extension of Q and (C, ⊗, 1) an R-linear neutral Tannakian cat-
egory equipped with a ⊗-invertible “Tate” object 1(1). In what follows, we write
Gal(C) for the Tannakian group of C and Gal0(C) for the kernel of the homomor-
phism Gal(C) ։ Gm, where Gm is the Tannakian group of the smallest Tannakian
subcategory of C containing 1(1).

Let H : DM(k; R) → D(Ind(C)) be an R-linear symmetric monoidal triangulated
functor with values in the derived category of ind-objects of C. Assume that H
preserves arbitrary direct sums and sends R(1) to 1(1). Given such a functor, let
H∗ be its composition with the total cohomology functor D(Ind(C)) → GrZ(Ind(C)).
Note that H∗(T) = H 2(P1)⊗(−1) and that H and H∗ are mixed realizations.

Recall from the Tannakian formalism that, since C is an R-linear neutral Tan-
nakian category, Grb
Z(C) is ⊗-equivalent to the R-linear category RepZ(Gal(C)) of
ﬁnite dimensional Z-graded continuous representations of Gal(C). Recall also that
the inclusion Gal0(C) ⊂ Gal(C) gives rise to the following restriction functor
{Vn}n∈Z 7→ (⊕nV2n, ⊕nV2n+1) ,

RepZ(Gal(C)) −→ RepZ/2(Gal0(C))

(2.1)

where RepZ/2(Gal0(C)) stands for the R-linear category of ﬁnite dimensional Z/2-
graded continuous representations of Gal0(C).

Theorem 2.2. Under the above assumptions, the restriction of the base-change
functor GrZ(Ind(C))

γ
→ Mod(⊕mH 2(P1)⊗(−m)) to Grb

Z(C) admits a factorization:

Grb

Z(C) ≃ RepZ(Gal(C))

(2.1)
−→ RepZ/2(Gal0(C)) ( Mod(⊕mH 2(P1)⊗(−m)) .

Consequently, whenever the functor H preserves compact objects, the modiﬁed mixed
realization associated to H∗ is given by
H∗ : Sm(k) −→ RepZ/2(Gal0(C))

X 7→ (⊕nH 2n(X), ⊕nH 2n+1(X)) .

Moreover, when k is of characteristic zero we can replace Sm(k) by Sch(k).

Nori realization. Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero, equipped with an em-
bedding k ֒→ C, and R a ﬁeld extension of Q. Recall from [13, §2][19, §8] the
construction of the R-linear neutral Tannakian category1 of Nori mixed motives
NMM(k; R) and of its ⊗-invertible Tate object 1(1). As proved in [13, Prop. 7.11],
there exists an R-linear symmetric monoidal triangulated functor HN from Vo-
evodsky’s big category of mixed motives DM(k; R) to D(Ind(NMM(k; R))) which
preserves arbitrary direct sums and compact objects, and sends R(1) to 1(1). Con-
sequently, the modiﬁed mixed realization associated to H∗N is given by
H∗N : Sch(k) −→ RepZ/2(Gal0(NMM(k; R)))
Jannsen realization. Recall from [20, Part I] the construction of the R-linear
neutral Tannakian category of Jannsen mixed motives JMM(k; R) and of its ⊗-
invertible Tate object 1(1). As explained in [19, Prop. 10.3.3], the universal prop-
erty of Nori’s category of mixed motives yields an exact symmetric monoidal func-
tor from NMM(k; R) to JMM(k; R). Let us denote by HJ the composition of HN
with the induced functor from D(Ind(NMM(k; R))) to D(Ind(JMM(k; R))). By
construction, HJ is an R-linear symmetric monoidal functor which preserves arbi-
trary direct sums and compact objects, and sends R(1) to 1(1). Consequently, the
modiﬁed mixed realization associated to H∗J is given by
H∗J : Sch(k) −→ RepZ/2(Gal0(JMM(k; R)))
de Rham realization. Let Vect(k) be the k-linear neutral Tannakian cate-
gory of ﬁnite dimensional k-vector spaces, equipped with the ⊗-invertible ob-
ject 1(1) := k.
In this case, the Tannakian group Gal0(Vect(k)) is trivial and
RepZ/2(Gal0(Vect(k))) reduces to the category of ﬁnite dimensional Z/2-graded k-
vector spaces VectZ/2(k). Recall that JMM(k; Q) comes equipped with an exact
symmetric monoidal de Rham realization functor from JMM(k; Q) to Vect(k). Let
HdR be the composition of HJ with the induced functor from D(Ind(JMM(k; Q)))
to D(Ind(Vect(k))). By construction, HdR is a symmetric monoidal functor which
preserves arbitrary direct sums and compact objects, and sends Q(1) to 1(1). Con-
sequently, the modiﬁed mixed realization associated to H∗dR is given by

1On the one hand, Choudhury-Gallauer Alves de Souza proved in [13] that the Tannakian
group Gal(NMM(k; R)) is isomorphic to Ayoub’s motivic Galois group [3, 4]. On the other hand,
Ayoub described “explicitly” his motivic Galois group in terms of closed polydiscs.

tion of HJ with the induced functor from D(Ind(JMM(k; Q))) to D(Ind(Vect(Q))).
By construction, HB is a Q-linear symmetric monoidal functor which preserves ar-
bitrary direct sums and compact objects, and sends Q(1) to 1(1). Consequently,
the modiﬁed mixed realization associated to H∗B is given by

de Rham-Betti realization. Let Vect(k, Q) be the Q-linear neutral Tannakian
category of triples (V, W, ω) (where V is a ﬁnite dimensional k-vector space, W
a ﬁnite dimensional Q-vector space, and ω an isomorphism V ⊗k C → W ⊗Q C),
equipped with the ⊗-invertible Tate object 1(1) := (k, Q, ·(2πi)−1). Recall that
JMM(k; Q) comes equipped with an exact symmetric monoidal de Rham-Betti real-
ization functor from JMM(k; Q) to Vect(k, Q). Let us denote by HdRB the composi-
tion of HJ with the induced functor from D(Ind(JMM(k; Q))) to D(Ind(Vect(k, Q))).
By construction, HdRB is a Q-linear symmetric monoidal functor which preserves
arbitrary direct sums and compact objects, and sends Q(1) to 1(1). Consequently,
the modiﬁed mixed realization associated to H∗dRB is given by
H∗dRB : Sch(k) −→ RepZ/2(Gal0(Vect(k, Q))) X 7→ (⊕nH 2n
dRB (X)) .
´Etale realization. Given a prime l, let Repl(Gal(k/k)) be the Ql-linear neutral
Tannakian category of ﬁnite dimensional l-adic continuous representations of the
absolute Galois group of k, equipped with the ⊗-invertible Tate object 1(1) :=
limnµln . Recall that JMM(k; Q) comes equipped with an exact symmetric monoidal
´etale realization functor from JMM(k; Q) to Repl(Gal(k/k)). Let us denote by
Het the composition of HJ with the induced functor from D(Ind(JMM(k; Q))) to
D(Ind(Repl(Gal(k/k)))). By construction, Het is a symmetric monoidal functor
which preserves arbitrary direct sums and compact objects, and sends Q(1) to
1(1). Consequently, the modiﬁed mixed realization associated to H∗et is given by

dRB(X), ⊕nH 2n+1

H∗et : Sch(k) −→ RepZ/2(Gal0(k/k))

Hodge realization. Recall from [39, §1] the construction of the Q-linear neutral
Tannakian category of mixed Q-Hodge structures MHS(Q) and of its ⊗-invertible
Tate object 1(1). Recall that JMM(k; Q) comes equipped with an exact symmetric
monoidal Hodge realization functor from JMM(k; Q) to MHS(Q). Let us denote by
HHod the composition of HJ with the induced functor from D(Ind(JMM(k; Q))) to
D(Ind(MHS(Q))). By construction, HHod is a Q-linear symmetric monoidal functor
which preserves arbitrary direct sums and compact objects, and sends Q(1) to 1(1).
Consequently, the modiﬁed mixed realization associated to HHod is given by

Remark 2.4 (Pure R-Hodge structures). Recall from [39, Pages 33-34] the con-
struction of the R-linear neutral Tannakian category of pure R-Hodge structures
HS(R) and of its ⊗-invertible Tate object 1(1). In this case, the Tannakian group
Gal(HS(R)) is the Hodge-Deligne circle ResC/R(Gm) and Gal0(HS(R)) the unitary
group U (1). Base-change along Q ⊂ R gives then rise to the modiﬁed realization

3. Noncommutative mixed realizations

The functor H nc of Theorem 1.3 should be considered the noncommutative
counterpart of the mixed realization H. Consequently, following §2, we have a
N , a noncommutative Jannsen realization H nc
noncommutative Nori realization H nc
J ,
a noncommutative de Rham realization H nc
dR, a noncommutative Betti realization
H nc
dRB, a noncommutative ´etale
realization H nc
Hod. Here are some of
the main features of noncommutative mixed realizations:

B , a noncommutative de Rham-Betti realization H nc

et , and a noncommutative Hodge realization H nc

Agreement. Let X be a smooth k-scheme of ﬁnite type. Thanks to Theorem 1.3,
we have H nc(perf dg(X)) ≃ H(X). When k is of characteristic zero, the same holds
without the smoothness assumption.

Excision. Let X be a smooth k-scheme of ﬁnite type and Z ֒→ X a smooth closed
subscheme. As proved in [48, Thm. 6.3], we have U (perfdg(X)Z )R ≃ U (perf dg(Z))R
in Mot(k; R), where perf dg(X)Z stands for the full dg subcategory of perf dg(X)
consisting of those perfect complexes which are supported on Z. Thanks to Remark
1.6(ii), we then conclude that H nc(perf dg(X)Z) ≃ H(Z). Roughly speaking, in
order to compute H(Z) we can embed Z into any ambient smooth scheme X.

Lax K¨unneth formula. As explained in [3, Lem. 1.13], the right adjoint of a
symmetric monoidal functor is a lax symmetric monoidal functor. Therefore, the
lax K¨unneth formula follows from the construction of H nc; see §6.
Additivity. Let A, B ⊆ C be dg categories yielding a semi-orthogonal decomposi-
tion H0(C) = hH0(A), H0(B)i in the sense of Bondal-Orlov [10]. As proved in [45,
Thm. 6.3], we have Uadd(C)R ≃ Uadd(A)R ⊕ Uadd(B)R in Hmo0(k)R. Thanks to
Remark 1.6(i), we then conclude that H nc(C) ≃ H nc(A) ⊕ H nc(B).
A1-homotopy invariance. Given a dg category A, let us denote by A[t] the
tensor product A⊗ k[t]. By construction, we have U (A[t])R ≃ U (A)R in Mot(k; R).
Therefore, making use of Remark 1.6(ii), we conclude that H nc(A[t]) ≃ H nc(A).

The agreement property completely determines the value of the noncommutative
mixed realizations H nc at the dg categories of the form perf dg(X). In what follows,
we compute the value of H nc at some “truly noncommutative” dg categories.

Example 3.1 (Finite dimensional algebras of ﬁnite global dimension). Let A be a
ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra of ﬁnite global dimension. As proved in [47, Pages 386-
387], we have Uadd(A)R ≃ ⊕r
j=1Uadd(Cj )R in Hmo0(k)R, where r stands for the
number of simple (right) A-modules and Cj for the center of the division k-algebra
EndA(Sj ) associated to the simple (right) A-module Sj. Thanks to Remark 1.6(i),
we then conclude that H nc(A) ≃ ⊕r
j=1H(Spec(Cj)). When k is algebraically closed,
we have Cj = k and consequently H nc(A) ≃ ⊕r

j=1H(Spec(k)).

Example 3.2 (Calkin algebra). Let Mr be the k-algebra of (r × r)-matrices with
k-coeﬃcients and M∞ := ∪∞r=1Mr the k-algebra of ﬁnite matrices. Consider the
k-algebra Γ of those (N × N)-matrices with k-coeﬃcients which have only a ﬁnite
number of non-zero entries and for which there exists a number j (which depends
on the matrix) such that each row and column has at most j non-zero entries. Note
that Γ is unital and that M∞ is a two-sided ideal of Γ. The associated quotient
Σ := Γ/M∞ is called the Calkin algebra. Given a (smooth) k-scheme of ﬁnite type
X, let us denote by Σ(X) the tensor product perf dg(X) ⊗ Σ. As proved in [44,

6

GONC¸ ALO TABUADA

Thm. 1.2], we have U (Σ(X))R ≃ Σ(U (perfdg(X))R) in the triangulated category
Mot(k; R). Thanks to Remark 1.6(ii), we then conclude that

(H∗)nc(Σ(X)) ≃ (⊕nH 2n+1(X), ⊕nH 2n(X)) ∈ RepZ/2(Gal0(C))

for every mixed realization H as in Theorem 2.2. Roughly speaking, the assignment
X 7→ Σ(X) corresponds to switching the degrees of the representation H∗(X).

Example 3.3 (Sheaves of Azumaya algebras). Let X be a k-scheme of ﬁnite type
and F a sheaf of Azumaya algebras over X. As proved in [47, Thm. 2.1], we have
Uadd(perf dg(F ))R ≃ Uadd(perf dg(X))R in Hmo0(k)R. Thanks to Remark 1.6(i), we
then conclude that H nc(perf dg(F )) ≃ H(X).
Example 3.4 (Diﬀerential operators in positive characteristic). Let k be a ﬁeld of
positive characteristic p > 0, X a smooth k-scheme of ﬁnite type, T ∗X (1) the Frobe-
nius twist of the cotangent bundle of X, and DX the sheaf of diﬀerential operators
on X. As proved by Bezrukavnikov, Mirkovi´c and Rumynin in [7, Thm. 2.2.3],
DX is a sheaf of Azumaya algebras over T ∗X (1). Consequently, it follows from the
preceding Example 3.3 that H nc(perf dg(DX )) ≃ H(T ∗X (1)).
Example 3.5 (Weyl algebras in positive characteristic). In the particular case where
X is the aﬃne space Ar, DX identiﬁes with the rth Weyl algebra Wr, and T ∗X (1)
with the ring of polynomials in 2r variables. Since the functor H is A1-homotopy
invariant, it follows then from Example 3.4 that H nc(Wr) ≃ H(Spec(k)).

Theorem 3.6 (Diﬀerential operators in characteristic zero). Let k be a ﬁeld of
characteristic zero, X a smooth k-scheme of ﬁnite type, and DX the sheaf of diﬀer-
ential operators on X. Assume that there exists a ﬁltration by closed subschemes

∅ = X−1 ֒→ X0 ֒→ · · · ֒→ Xj ֒→ · · · ֒→ Xr−1 ֒→ Xr = X

(3.7)
such that Xj\Xj−1, 0 ≤ j ≤ r, are smooth aﬃne k-schemes of ﬁnite type. Under
these assumptions, we have H nc(perf dg(DX )) ≃ H(X).
Example 3.8 (Gm-schemes). Thanks to the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition [8],
Theorem 3.6 holds, in particular, for every smooth projective k-scheme X equipped
with a Gm-action in which the ﬁxed points are isolated.
In all these cases the
schemes Xj\Xj−1 are aﬃne spaces. Examples include projective homogeneous
varieties, toric varieties, symmetric varieties, etc.

Example 3.9 (Weyl algebras in characteristic zero). In the particular case where
X = Ar, DX identiﬁes with the rth Weyl algebra Wr. Since the functor H is A1-
homotopy invariant, it follows then from Theorem 3.6 that H nc(Wr) ≃ H(Spec(k)).

Example 3.10 (Lie algebras). Let G be a connected semisimple algebraic C-group,
B a Borel subgroup of G, g the Lie algebra of G, and Uev(g)/I the quotient of
the universal enveloping algebra of g by the kernel of the trivial character. Thanks
to Beilinson-Bernstein’s celebrated “localisation” result [6], it follows then from
Theorem 3.6 that H nc(Uev(g)/I) ≃ H nc(perfdg(DG/B)) ≃ H(G/B).
Remark 3.11 (Hochschild homology). As explained in [40, §2.2.8], Hochschild ho-
mology HH factors through Hmo0(k)R.
In the case where k is of characteristic
zero and X is a smooth aﬃne k-scheme of dimension d, Wodzicki proved in [54,
Thm. 2] that HHn(perf dg(DX )) ≃ H 2d−n
dR(X) = 0, this implies
Uadd(perf dg(DX ))R 6≃ Uadd(A)R in Hmo0(k)R for every commutative k-algebra A.

4. Noncommutative periods

Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero, equipped with an embedding k ֒→ C, and

C[t, t−1] the Z-graded C-algebra of Laurent polynomials with t of degree 1.

Given an object (V, W, ω) of Vect(k, Q), let us denote by P (V, W, ω) ⊆ C the
subset of entries of the matrix representations of ω (with respect to basis of V and
W ); see [19, §9.2]. For every λ ∈ C×, we write P (V, W, ω)λ for the set obtained from
P (V, W, ω) by multiplying all the elements with λ. In the same vein, given an object
{(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z of Grb
Z(Vect(k, Q)), let us denote by P({(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z) the
Z-graded k-subalgebra of C[t, t−1] generated in degree n by the elements of the set
P (Wn, Wn, ωn). In the case of a k-scheme of ﬁnite type X, P(X) := P(H∗dRB(X))
is called the Z-graded algebra of periods of X. This algebra, originally introduced by
Grothendieck in the sixties, plays nowadays a key role in the study of transcendental
numbers; see Ayoub [2], Huber-M¨uller [19], and Kontsevich-Zagier [27].

Consider the quotient Z/2-graded C-algebra C2πi

the homomorphism φ : C[t, t−1] ։ C2πi
C-vector space of C2πi

Z/2 is C0 ⊕ C1 and that the multiplication law is given by

Z/2 := C[t, t−1]/h1 − (2πi)t2i and
Z/2. Note that the underlying Z/2-graded

(4.1)

(λ0, λ1) · (λ′0, λ′1) = (λ0λ′0 + λ1λ′1(2πi)−1, λ0λ′1 + λ1λ′0) .

The category Ind(Vect(k, Q)) is equivalent to the category of triples (V, W, ω), where
V is a (not necessarily ﬁnite dimensional) k-vector space, W a Q-vector space, and
ω an isomorphism V ⊗k C → W ⊗Q C. Given an object {(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z of
GrZ(Ind(Vect(k, Q))), let us denote by P nc({(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z) the Z/2-graded k-
subalgebra of C2πi
Z/2 generated in degree 0 (resp. degree 1) by the elements of the set
∪n∈ZP (V2n, W2n, ω2n)(2πi)−n
resp. ∪n∈Z P (V2n+1, W2n+1, ω2n+1)(2πi)−n .
In the case of a dg category A, P nc(A) := P nc((H∗dRB)nc(A)) is called the Z/2-
graded algebra of periods of A. By construction, if A is derived Morita equivalent
to B, then P nc(A) = P nc(B). Moreover, we have the following agreement result:

Theorem 4.2. Let A be a dg category and X a k-scheme of ﬁnite type.
(H∗dRB)nc(A) ≃ H∗dRB(X), then P nc(A) = φ(P(X)).
Corollary 4.3 (Derived Morita invariance). Let X and Y be two k-schemes of
ﬁnite type. If perf dg(X) ≃ perf dg(Y ) in Hmo(k), then φ(P(X)) = φ(P(Y )).

If

Intuitively speaking, Theorem 4.2 and Corollary 4.3 show that as soon as we
trivialize the graded polynomial 1 − (2πi)t2 ∈ C[t, t−1], the resulting theory of
periods factors through perfect complexes!

(i) The degree 0 component P nc(A)0 is a ﬁeld extension of k.

Remark 4.4.
(ii) Since the functor (H∗dRB)nc factors through U (−)Q (see Remark 1.6(ii)), we
can similarly deﬁne the Z/2-graded algebra of periods P nc(N ) of a noncommu-
tative mixed motive N ∈ Mot(k; Q). In this generality, Theorem 4.2 holds mu-
tatis mutandis with X replaced by a geometric mixed motive M ∈ DMgm(k; Q).

Example 4.5 (Finite dimensional algebras of ﬁnite global dimension). Let A be a
ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra of ﬁnite global dimension. Recall from Example 3.1
j=1H∗dRB(Spec(Cj )) for ﬁnite ﬁeld extension Cj /k. Theorem
that (H∗dRB)nc(A) ≃ ⊕r
4.2 then implies that P nc(A) = φ(P(Πr
j=1Spec(Cj ))). As explained in [19, §12.3],
since the k-schemes Spec(Cj ) are 0-dimensional, P(Πr
j=1Spec(Cj )) agrees with the

8

ﬁeld extension k(∪r
k(∪r

j=1Cj). Consequently, we conclude that P nc(A) = P nc(A)0 =

j=1Cj). In the case where k ⊆ Q, we hence obtain solely algebraic numbers.

Example 4.6 (Noncommutative Kummer motives). Let k be a number ﬁeld. Recall
17→q
−→ Gm], with q ∈ k×, are
from [1, §20.3] that the 1-motives of the form K(q) := [Z
called the Kummer motives. As explained in §5.2, the morphisms in the triangulated
category Mot(k; Q) from U (k)Q and U (k)Q[−1] are in bijection with the elements of
K1(k)Q = k× ⊗ Q. Therefore, we can consider the following distinguished triangle:

U (k)Q[−2] −→ K nc(q) −→ U (k)Q

q

−→ U (k)Q[−1] .

Since K(q), considered as an object of DMgm(k; Q), is an extension of Q(0) by Q(1),
we have an isomorphism between (H∗dRB)nc(K nc(q)) and H∗dRB(K(q)). Making
use of Remark 4.4(ii), we then conclude that P nc(K nc(q)) = φ(P(K(q))). As
explained in [1, §23.3.3], the transcendental number log(q) belongs to P(K(q))1.
Consequently, it belongs also to the degree 1 component of P nc(K nc(q)).

Example 4.7 (Elliptic curves). Let k = Q and E the elliptic curve with trivial Eisen-
stein series G6 and aﬃne equation y2 = 4x3 − 4x. Thanks to Theorem 1.3, we have
an isomorphism between (H∗dRB)nc(perf dg(E)) and H∗dRB(E). Therefore, Theorem
4.2 implies that P nc(perf dg(E)) = φ(P(E)). As explained in [19, Ex. 13.4.2], the
, belong to P(E)1.

, and −i π
ω1

transcendental numbers ω1 := R ∞

Consequently, they belong also to the degree 1 component of P nc(perf dg(E)).

Remark 4.8. Thanks to Example 3.3, Example 4.7 holds mutatis mutandis with
perfdg(E) replaced by perf dg(F ) with F a sheaf of Azumaya algebras over E.

Additivity. Given objects (V, W, ω) and (V ′, W ′, ω′) of Ind(Vect(k, Q)), the sub-
set P ((V, W, ω) ⊕ (V ′, W ′, ω′)) ⊆ C consists of the complex numbers of the form
p + p′, with p ∈ P (V, W, ω) and p′ ∈ P (V ′, W ′, ω′). Therefore, given objects
{(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z and {(V ′n, W ′n, ω′n)}n∈Z of GrZ(Ind(Vect(k, Q))), we conclude
that the Z/2-graded k-algebra P nc({(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z ⊕ {(V ′n, W ′n, ω′n)}n∈Z) agrees
with the smallest Z/2-graded k-subalgebra

P nc({(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z) ⋄ P nc({(V ′n, W ′n, ω′n)}n∈Z) ⊆ C2πi

Z/2

containing P nc({(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z) and P nc({(V ′n, W ′n, ω′n)}n∈Z). The additivity
property, mentioned at §3, gives then automatically rise to the following result:

Corollary 4.9. If A, B ⊆ C are dg categories yielding a semi-orthogonal decompo-
sition H0(C) = hH0(A), H0(B)i, then P nc(C) = P nc(A) ⋄ P nc(B).

Example 4.10 (Quadrics). Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional k-vector space of dimen-
sion d ≥ 3 and q : V → k a (non-degenerate) quadratic form. Out of those
data we can construct the associated (smooth) projective quadric Qq ⊂ P(V )
of dimension d − 2, the even Cliﬀord algebra C0(q), and the signed determinant
δ(q) ∈ k×/(k×)2. As proved by Kapranov in [21, §4], we have a semi-orthogonal
decomposition perf(Qq) = hC0(q), O(−d + 3), . . . , Oi. Consequently, Corollary
4.9 implies that φ(P(Qq)) = P nc(C0(q)) ⋄ P nc(k) ⋄ · · · ⋄ P nc(k). As explained
in [47, Pages 384-385], Uadd(C0(q))Q is isomorphic to Uadd(k)Q when d is odd, to

Uadd(k)Q ⊕ Uadd(k)Q when d is even and δ(q) ∈ (k×)2, and to Uadd(k(pδ(q)))Q

when d is even and δ(q) 6∈ (k×)2. Making use of Remark 1.6(i) and of the equalities

DERIVED MORITA INVARIANCE OF MIXED REALIZATIONS AND PERIODS

P nc(Qq) = φ(P(Qq)) and P nc(k) = k, we then obtain the following computation:

φ(P(Qq)) = φ(P(Qq))0 =(k(pδ(q))

k

if d is even and δ(q) 6∈ (k×)2
otherwise .

Remark 4.11. Thanks to the work of Kuznetsov [28], the preceding Example 4.10
can be generalized from quadrics to quadric ﬁbrations.

Example 4.12 (Grassmannian-Pfaﬃan duality). Let XL be a generic linear section
of codimension r of the Grassmannian Gr(2, W ) (with W equal to k⊕6 or k⊕7)
under the Pl¨ucker embedding, and YL the corresponding dual linear section of the
cubic Pfaﬃan Pf(4, W ∗) in P(Λ2W ∗). For example, when W = k⊕6 and r = 6, XL
is a K3 surface of degree 14 and YL a Pfaﬃan cubic 4-fold. As proved by Kuznetsov
in [30, §10-11], one of the following three situations occurs:

(i) there exists a semi-orthogonal decomposition perf(XL) = hperf(YL), E1, . . . , Eni

with the Ej’s exceptional bundles on XL;

(ii) there exists a semi-orthogonal decomposition perf(YL) = hperf(XL), E′1, . . . , E′ni

with the E′j’s exceptional bundles on YL;

(iii) there exists a derived Morita equivalence between perf dg(XL) and perf dg(YL).
Therefore, Corollary 4.9 and Theorem 4.2 imply the equality φ(P(XL)) = φ(P(YL)).
Roughly speaking, the algebras P(XL) and P(YL) are the same modulo 2πi.

Remark 4.13. Thanks to the work of Kuznetsov [29], the preceding Example 4.12
holds similarly for other cases of homological projective duality.

5. Preliminaries

Throughout the article k will be a perfect ﬁeld and R a commutative Q-algebra.

5.1. Dg categories. Let (C(k), ⊗, k) be the category of (cochain) complexes of
k-vector spaces. A dg category A is a category enriched over C(k) and a dg functor
F : A → B is a functor enriched over C(k); consult Keller’s ICM survey [22].

Let A be a dg category. The opposite dg category Aop has the same objects
as A and Aop(x, y) := A(y, x). The category H0(A) has the same objects as A
and H0(A)(x, y) := H 0(A(x, y)), where H 0 stands for 0th cohomology. A right
dg A-module is a dg functor Aop → Cdg(k) with values in the dg category Cdg(k)
of complexes of k-vector spaces. Let us denote by C(A) the category of right dg
A-modules. Following [22, §3.2], the derived category D(A) of A is deﬁned as the
localization of C(A) with respect to the objectwise quasi-isomorphisms. We write
Dc(A) for the triangulated subcategory of compact objects.

A dg functor F : A → B is called a derived Morita equivalence if it induces an
equivalence of categories D(A) ≃ D(B); see [22, §4.6]. As proved in [45, Thm. 5.3],
dgcat(k) admits a Quillen model structure whose weak equivalences are the derived
Morita equivalences. Let us denote by Hmo(k) the associated homotopy category.
The tensor product A⊗B of dg categories is deﬁned as follows: the set of objects is
the cartesian product and (A ⊗ B)((x, w), (y, z)) := A(x, y) ⊗ B(w, z). As explained
in [22, §2.3], this construction gives rise to a symmetric monoidal structure on

10

GONC¸ ALO TABUADA

dgcat(k), which descends to the homotopy category Hmo(k). An A-B-bimodule B
is a dg functor A ⊗ Bop → Cdg(k) or equivalently a right dg (Aop ⊗ B)-module.

Recall from Kontsevich [23, 24, 26] that a dg category A is called smooth if the
A-A-bimodule A ⊗ Aop → Cdg(k), (x, y) 7→ A(y, x), belongs to Dc(Aop ⊗ A) and

proper if Pn dim H nA(x, y) < ∞ for any pair of objects (x, y). Examples include

ﬁnite dimensional k-algebras of ﬁnite global dimension (when k is perfect) and dg
categories of perfect complexes perf dg(Y ) associated to smooth proper k-schemes Y .

5.2. Noncommutative mixed motives. Recall from [41, §2][46, §4] the construc-
tion of the triangulated category of noncommutative mixed motives Mot(k; R). By
construction, this closed symmetric monoidal triangulated comes equipped with a
symmetric monoidal functor U (−)R : Hmo(k) → Mot(k; R). Moreover, it is nat-
urally enriched over the derived category D(R); we denote this enrichment by
HomD(R)(−, −). Given dg categories A and B, with A smooth and proper, re-
call from [46, Prop. 4.4] that we have a natural isomorphism

HomD(R)(U (A)R, U (B)R) ≃ KH(Aop ⊗ B) ∧ HR ,

(5.1)
where KH(Aop ⊗ B) stands for the homotopy K-theory spectrum of Aop ⊗ B and
HR for the Eilenberg-MacLane ring spectrum of R.

5.3. Orbit categories. Let (M, ⊗, 1) be an R-linear symmetric monoidal additive
category and O ∈ M a ⊗-invertible object. The associated orbit category M/−⊗O
has the same objects as M and morphisms HomM/−⊗O (a, b) deﬁned by the direct
sum ⊕m∈ZHomM(a, b ⊗ O⊗m). Given objects a, b, c and morphisms
f = {fm}m∈Z ∈ ⊕mHomM(a, b ⊗ O⊗m) g = {gm}m∈Z ∈ ⊕mHomM(b, c ⊗ O⊗m) ,
the jth-component of g ◦ f is deﬁned as Pm(gj−m ⊗ O⊗m) ◦ fm. The functor
where f0 = f and fm = 0 if m 6= 0, is endowed with an isomorphism π◦(−⊗O) ⇒ π
and is 2-universal among all such functors; see [43, §7]. The category M/−⊗O is
R-linear and additive. Moreover, as proved in [43, Lem. 7.3], it inherits from M a
symmetric monoidal structure making the functor π symmetric monoidal.

π : M −→ M/−⊗O a 7→ a f 7→ f = {fm}m∈Z ,

6. Proof of Theorem 1.3

Let SH(k) be the Morel-Voevodsky’s stable A1-homotopy category of (P1, ∞)-
spectra [33, 52] and DA(k; R) the R-coeﬃcients variant introduced by Ayoub in
[5, §4]. Recall from loc. cit.
that these two categories are related by a sym-
metric monoidal triangulated functor (−)R : SH(k) → DA(k; R). Thanks to the
work of R¨odings-Sptizweck-Østvær [38], the E∞-ring spectrum KGL ∈ SH(k) rep-
resenting homotopy K-theory admits a strictly commutative model. Therefore, we
can consider the closed symmetric monoidal Quillen model category Mod(KGLR)
of KGLR-modules. Let us denote by Ho(Mod(KGLR)) the associated homotopy
category. By construction, we have the following composition

(6.1)

Sm(k)

Σ∞(−+)

−→ DA(k; R) −∧KGLR−→ Ho(Mod(KGLR)) .

Lemma 6.2.

(i) The triangulated category Ho(Mod(KGLR)) is compactly gener-
ated by the objects Σ∞(Y+)R ∧ KGLR with Y a smooth projective k-scheme.
Moreover, these latter objects are strongly dualizable and self-dual.

(ii) The objects Σ∞(X+)R ∧ KGLR, with X ∈ Sm(k), are strongly dualizable.

DERIVED MORITA INVARIANCE OF MIXED REALIZATIONS AND PERIODS

11

Proof. (i) As proved in [5, Prop. 2.2.27-2], the triangulated category DA(k; R) is
compactly generated by the objects Σ∞(Y+)R(m) with Y a smooth projective k-
scheme and m ∈ Z. Thanks to the periodicity isomorphism KGLR ≃ KGLR(1)[2],
we then conclude that the category Ho(Mod(KGLR)) is compactly generated by the
objects Σ∞(Y+) ∧ KGLR. The fact that these latter objects are strongly dualizable
and self-dual is proved in [42, Lem. 8.22].

(ii) It is well-known that the strongly dualizable objects of a closed symmetric
monoidal triangulated category are stable under distinguished triangles and direct
summands. Therefore, since the objects Σ∞(X+)R ∧ KGLR, with X ∈ Sm(k), are
compact, the proof follows now from item (i).
(cid:3)

Proposition 6.3. There exists an R-linear fully-faithful symmetric monoidal tri-
angulated functor Φ making the following diagram commute:

(6.4)

Sm(k)

(6.1)

X7→perfdg(X)

/ Hmo(k)

Ho(Mod(KGLR))

Hom(−,KGLR)

U(−)R

Ho(Mod(KGLR))

Φ

/ Mot(k; R) ,

where Hom(−, −) stands for the internal Hom. The functor Φ preserves moreover
arbitrary direct sums.

Proof. As proved in [42, Cor. 2.5(ii)], there exists an R-linear fully-faithful sym-
metric monoidal triangulated functor Φ making the following diagram commute:

X7→perfdg(X)

Sm(k)

Σ∞(−+)R

DA(k; R)

−∧KGLR

/ Hmo(k)

U(−)R

Mot(k; R)

Hom(−,U(k)R)

Ho(Mod(KGLR))

Φ

/ Mot(k; R) .

The functor Φ preserves moreover arbitrary direct sums. Hence, the proof will
consist on “moving” the internal Hom from the right to the left-hand side.

Recall from [42, §7-8] the construction of the commutative monoid object KGLnc;R
and of the closed symmetric monoidal Quillen model category Mod(KGLnc;R) of
KGLnc;R-modules. Let us denote by Ho(Mod(KGLnc;R)) the associated homotopy
category. By construction, this latter category is naturally enriched over noncom-
mutative mixed motives Mot(k; R); we denote this enrichment by HomMot(k;R)(−, −).
Moreover, it comes equipped with a symmetric monoidal functor

(6.5)

Ho(Mod(KGLR)) −→ Ho(Mod(KGLnc;R)) ,

which sends Σ∞(X+) ∧ KGLR to Σ∞(X+) ⊗ KGLnc;R. As explained in [42, §8],
the functor Φ is deﬁned as the composition of (6.5) with HomMot(k;R)(KGLnc;R, −).

Similarly to the proof of [42, Lem. 8.7], the functor Sm(k) → Mot(k; R), sending
X to U (perf dg(X))R, can be described by the following formula:

(6.6)

X 7→ HomMot(k;R)(KGLnc, Hom(Σ∞(X+) ⊗ KGLnc, KGLnc)) .

Since the objects Σ∞(X+)R ∧ KGLR, with X ∈ Sm(k), are strongly dualizable and
the functor (6.5) is symmetric monoidal, an argument similar to the one used in
[42, Page 535] allows us to conclude that the composition

Sm(k)

(6.1)
−→ Ho(Mod(KGLR))

Hom(−,KGLR)

−→

Ho(Mod(KGLR)) Φ−→ Mot(k; R)

can also be described by the above formula (6.6). This implies the commutativity
of diagram (6.4), and hence ﬁnishes the proof.
(cid:3)

Let HZ ∈ SH(k) be the E∞-ring spectrum representing motivic cohomology.
On the one hand, thanks to the work of Bloch [9] (see also [36, §6]), we have
KGLR ≃ ⊕m∈ZHZR(m)[2m]. On the other hand, thanks to the work of R¨odings-
Østvær [37], Voevodsky’s big category of mixed motives DM(k; R) identiﬁes with
the homotopy category Ho(Mod(HZR)) of HZR-modules. Under this identiﬁcation,
the Tate object T := R(1)[2] corresponds to the HZR-module HZR(1)[2]. Since
the motives M (X)R, with X ∈ Sm(k), are strongly dualizable, base-change along
HZR → KGLR gives then rise to an R-linear symmetric monoidal triangulated
functor − ∧HZR KGLR making the diagram commute:

(6.7)

Sm(k)

M(−)R

DM(k; R)

Hom(−,M(Spec(k))R)

Sm(k)

(6.1)

Ho(Mod(KGLR))

Hom(−,KGLR)

DM(k; R)

−∧HZR KGLR

/ Ho(Mod(KGLR)) .

We now have all the ingredients necessary for the construction of the functor H nc.
Thanks to Lemma 6.2, the triangulated category Ho(Mod(KGLR)) is compactly
generated. Therefore, since the triangulated functor Φ preserves arbitrary direct
sums, we conclude from [34, Thm. 8.4.4] that it admits a right adjoint Φr.

As mentioned above, we have KGLR ≃ ⊕m∈ZHZR(m)[2m]. Therefore, since by
assumption the functor H is lax symmetric monoidal and H(⊕mT⊗m) ≃ ⊕mH(T)⊗m,
we have the following commutative diagram

(6.8)

/ Mod(⊕mT⊗m)

/ Mod(⊕mH(T)⊗m) ,

where “can” stands for the canonical functor and H′ for the R-linear lax symmetric
monoidal functor naturally associated to H. The searched functor H nc can now be
deﬁned as the following composition:

Hmo(k)

U(−)R→ Mot(k; R) Φr

→ Ho(Mod(KGLR)) H′◦can−→ Mod(⊕mH(T)⊗m) .

The commutativity of diagram (1.4) follows now from the commutativity of dia-
grams (6.4) and (6.7)-(6.8), and from the fact that the functor Φ is fully-faithful.
This concludes the proof of the ﬁrst claim of Theorem 1.3.

Let us now assume that k is of characteristic zero and prove the second claim of

Theorem 1.3. Recall that a cartesian square of k-schemes of ﬁnite type

(6.9)

Z ×X V

Z

i

/ V

p

/ X

is called an abstract blow-up square if i is a closed embedding and p is a proper map
inducing an isomorphism p−1(X\Z)red ≃ (X\Z)red. Consider the composition

Γ1 : Sch(k)

(6.1)
−→ Ho(Mod(KGLR))

Hom(−,KGLR)

−→

Ho(Mod(KGLR))

as well as the composition

Γ2 : Sch(k)

X7→perf dg(X)

−→ Hmo(k)

U(−)R−→ Mot(k; R) Φr

−→ Ho(Mod(KGLR)) .

Given a k-scheme of ﬁnite type X, Hironaka’s resolution of singularities (see [17,
Thm. 1]) yields a ﬁnite sequence of proper maps

Xr

pj−→ Xj−1 −→ · · · −→ X1

pr−→ Xr−1 −→ · · · −→ Xj

p1−→ X0 := X
with Xr smooth and Xj obtained from Xj−1 by an abstract blow-up square

Zj−1 ×Xj−1 Xj

Zj−1

/ Xj

pj

/ Xj−1

with Zj−1 smooth. Using the commutativity of diagram (6.4), the fully-faithfulness
of the functor Φ, and the fact that the k-schemes Xr, Zr−1, and Zr−1 ×Xr−1 Xr
are smooth, we can then inductively apply Lemma 6.10 below in order to conclude
that Γ1(X) ≃ Γ2(X). Consequently, by deﬁnition of H and H nc, we have H(X) ≃
H nc(perf dg(X)) in Mod(⊕mH(T)⊗m). This ﬁnishes the proof of Theorem 1.3.

Lemma 6.10. The following commutative squares

(6.11)

Γ1(X)

Γ1(p)

Γ1(V )

Γ2(X)

Γ2(p)

Γ2(V )

Γ1(i)

Γ2(i)

Γ1(Z)

/ Γ1(Z ×X V )

Γ2(Z)

/ Γ1(Z ×X V ) ,

obtained by applying Γ1 and Γ2 to (6.9), are homotopy cartesian.

Proof. As explained by Voevodsky in [50, §4], the functor Σ∞(−+) satisﬁes descent
along abstract blow-up squares, i.e. it sends abstract blow-up squares to homotopy
cartesian squares. Moreover, the objects Σ∞(X+), with X ∈ Sch(k), are compact
in SH(k). Making use of Lemma 6.2, we then conclude that the objects Σ∞(X+)R ∧
KGLR, with X ∈ Sch(k), are strongly dualizable in Ho(Mod(KGLR)). This implies
that the left-hand side square in (6.11) is homotopy cartesian.

Given k-schemes of ﬁnite type X and Y , with Y moreover smooth projective,

we have natural isomorphisms

(6.12)

(6.13)

(6.14)

HomD(R)(U (perf dg(Y ))R, U (perf dg(X))R)

≃ KH(perf dg(Y )op ⊗ perf dg(X)) ∧ HR
≃ KH(perf dg(Y ) ⊗ perf dg(X)) ∧ HR
≃ KH(Y × X) ∧ HR ,

where (6.12) is a particular case of (5.1), (6.13) follows from the derived Morita
equivalence perf dg(Y )op ≃ perf dg(Y ), G 7→ Hom(G, OY ), and (6.14) from the de-
rived Morita equivalence perf dg(Y ) ⊗ perf dg(X) ≃ perf dg(Y × X), (G, H) 7→ G ⊠ H,
proved in [48, Lem. 4.26]. By applying the functor HomD(R)(U (perf dg(Y ))R, −) to

perf dg(X)

p∗

/ perfdg(V )

i∗

perfdg(Z)

/ perfdg(Z ×X V ) ,

we hence obtain the following commutative square:

KH(Y × X) ∧ HR

p∗

KH(Y × V ) ∧ HR

i∗

KH(Y × Z) ∧ HR

/ KH(Y × (Z ×X V )) ∧ HR .

As proved by Haesemeyer in [16, Thm. 3.5], homotopy K-theory satisﬁes descent
along abstract blow-up squares. Therefore, since the functor − ∧ HR preserves
homotopy (co)cartesian squares and Y × (6.9) is also an abstract blow-up square,
the preceding square (6.15) is homotopy cartesian. Lemma 6.2, combined with the
commutative diagram (6.4), allows us then to conclude that the right-hand side
square in (6.11) is homotopy cartesian. This ﬁnishes the proof.
(cid:3)

Remark 6.16 (Factorization(s)). As proved in [45, Cor. 5.10], there is a natural
bijection between HomHmo(k)(A, B) and the set of isomorphism classes of the full
triangulated subcategory rep(A, B) ⊂ D(Aop ⊗ B) of those A-B-bimodules B such
that for every x ∈ A the right dg B-module B(x, −) belongs to Dc(B). Under this
bijection, the composition law corresponds to the tensor product of bimodules. The
additivization of Hmo(k) is the additive category Hmo0(k) with the same objects
as Hmo(k) and with abelian groups of morphisms HomHmo0(k)(A, B) given by the
Grothendieck group K0rep(A, B) of the category rep(A, B). The R-linearization of
Hmo0(k) is the R-linear category Hmo0(k)R obtained from Hmo0(k) by tensoring
the abelian groups of morphisms with R. By construction, we have the functor

Uadd(−)R : Hmo(k) −→ Hmo0(k)R A 7→ A B 7→ [B]R .

As explained in [48, §4.3], the functor U (−)R factors through Uadd(−)R. Conse-
quently, given a mixed realization H, the functor H nc also factors through Uadd(−)R.

7. Proof of Theorem 2.2

Note that ⊕mH 2(P1)⊗(−m) belongs to GrZ(Ind(C)), that H 2(P1)⊗(−1) belongs

to Grb

Z(C), and that we have the following adjunction of categories:

(7.1)

Given any object a := {an}n∈Z of Grb

γ(a ⊗ H 2(P1)⊗(−1))

:= a ⊗ H 2(P1)⊗(−1) ⊗ (⊕mH 2(P1)⊗(−m))
≃ a ⊗ (⊕mH 2(P1)⊗(−m)) =: γ(a) .

Therefore, thanks to the universal property of orbit categories (see §5.3), there
exists an R-linear symmetric monoidal functor γ′ making the diagram commute:

where (7.3) follows from the fact that the functor b ⊗ − preserves arbitrary direct
sums and that the objects of Grb
Z(C) are compact in GrZ(Ind(C)). This implies that
the functor γ′ in diagram (7.2) is moreover fully-faithful.

Recall from the Tannakian formalism that, since C is an R-linear neutral Tan-
nakian category, Grb
Z(C) is ⊗-equivalent to the R-linear category Rep(Gal(C)× Gm)
of ﬁnite dimensional continuous representations of Gal(C) × Gm. The weight grad-
ing ω, induced by the canonical morphism Gm → Gal(C)×Gm, and the ⊗-invertible
object H 2(P1)⊗(−1) equip Grb
Z(C) with a neutral Tate triple structure in the sense
of Deligne-Milne [12, §5]. Therefore, as proved in [32, Prop. 14.1], the category
Grb
Z(C)/−⊗H2(P1)⊗(−1) becomes a neutral Tannakian category. Moreover, its Tan-
nakian group is given by the kernel of the homomorphism

(7.4)

Gal(Grb

Z(C)) = Gal(C) × Gm

/ Gm ,

where the right-hand side copy of Gm is the Tannakian group of the smallest Tan-
nakian subcategory of Grb
Z(C) containing H 2(P1)⊗(−1). Note that the ﬁrst com-
ponent of (7.4) is the homomorphism Gal(C) ։ Gm introduced in §2, while the
second component Gm → Gm is multiplication by 2. This implies that the kernel of
(7.4) is equal to Gal0(C) × µ2. Consequently, thanks to the Tannakian formalism,
Grb
Z(C)/−⊗H2(P1)⊗(−1) is ⊗-equivalent to the R-linear category Rep(Gal0(C) × µ2)
of ﬁnite dimensional continuous representations of Gal0(C) × µ2. Finally, under

the ⊗-equivalences of categories between Rep(Gal(C) × Gm) and RepZ(Gal(C)) and
Rep(Gal0(C) × µ2) and RepZ/2(Gal0(C)), respectively, the functor π in (7.2) iden-
tiﬁes with the restriction functor (2.1). This concludes the proof of Theorem 2.2.

8. Proof of Theorem 3.6

Consider the canonical dg functor − ⊗OX DX : perf dg(X) → perf dg(DX ). The
proof will consist on showing that the image of U (perf dg(X))R → U (perf dg(DX ))R
under the functor Φr (see §6) is invertible. By construction of H nc, this implies
that H nc(perf dg(DX )) ≃ H(X) for every mixed realization H.

Following Lemma 6.2(i), the triangulated category Ho(Mod(KGLR)) is com-
pactly generated by the strongly dualizable and self-dual objects Σ∞(Y+) ∧ KGLR
with Y a smooth projective k-scheme. Therefore, thanks to the commutative dia-
gram (6.4), in order to show that the image of U (perf dg(X))R → U (perf dg(DX ))R
under Φr is invertible, it suﬃces to show that the induced morphisms

HomD(R)(U (perf dg(Y ))R, U (perf dg(X))R −→ U (perf dg(DX ))R)

are invertible. As mentioned in §5.2, the preceding morphism identiﬁes with

KH(perfdg(Y )op ⊗ perf dg(X)) ∧ HR −→ KH(perfdg(Y )op ⊗ perf dg(DX )) ∧ HR .

Using the derived Morita equivalence perf dg(Y )op ≃ perf dg(Y ), G 7→ Hom(G, OY ),
we then conclude from Proposition 8.1 below that the preceding morphism is in-
vertible. This ﬁnishes the proof of Theorem 3.6.

Proposition 8.1. Given smooth k-schemes of ﬁnite type X and Y , with X as in
Theorem 3.6, the induced morphism

(8.2)

KH(perfdg(Y ) ⊗ perfdg(X)) −→ KH(perf dg(Y ) ⊗ perf dg(DX ))

is invertible in the homotopy category of spectra.

The remainder of this section is devoted to the proof of Proposition 8.1. We
will consider (8.2) as a morphism in two variables (Y the ﬁrst variable and X the
second variable) and divide the proof into three main steps.

Step I: Reduction to the aﬃne case in the ﬁrst variable. Given any dg
functor A → B, consider the induced morphism

αY : KH(perfdg(Y ) ⊗ A) −→ KH(perf dg(Y ) ⊗ B) .

Lemma 8.3. If αY is invertible when Y = Spec(B) is a smooth aﬃne k-scheme
of ﬁnite type, then αY is invertible for every smooth k-scheme of ﬁnite type Y .

Proof. In order to simplify the exposition, let KH(Y ; A) := KH(perfdg(Y ) ⊗ A);
similarly with A replaced by B. Given a Zariski open cover U1 ∪ U2 = Y ′ of a
smooth k-scheme of ﬁnite type Y ′, let us write U12 for the intersection U1 ∩ U2.
Thanks to Bondal-Van den Bergh’s induction principle [11, Prop. 3.3.1], in order
if αU1 , αU2 , and
to prove Lemma 8.3 it suﬃces to prove the following condition:

αU12 are invertible, then αY ′ is also invertible. Consider the commutative diagram:

We claim that the “front” and “back” squares of (8.4) are homotopy cartesian.
Note that this implies the preceding condition and consequently ﬁnishes the proof
of Lemma 8.3. We will focus ourselves solely in the “back” square; the proof of the
other case is similar. Consider the following commutative diagram

(8.5)

perf dg(Y ′)Z

/ perfdg(Y ′)

/ perf dg(U1)

perf dg(U2)Z

/ perfdg(U2)

/ perfdg(U12)

in Hmo(k), where Z stands for the closed complement Y ′\U1 = U2\U12. Thanks
to the work of Thomason-Trobaugh [49, §5], both rows of (8.5) are short exact
sequences of dg categories (see [22, §4.6]). Moreover, the induced dg functor
perfdg(Y ′)Z → perf dg(U2)Z is a derived Morita equivalence; see [49, Thm. 2.6.3].
As proved by Drinfeld [14, Prop. 1.6.3], the functor − ⊗ A preserves short exact
sequences of dg categories. Therefore, (8.5) gives rise to the commutative diagram

(8.6)

perfdg(Y ′)Z ⊗ A

/ perf dg(Y ′) ⊗ A

/ perf dg(U1) ⊗ A

≃

perfdg(U2)Z ⊗ A

/ perf dg(U2) ⊗ A

/ perf dg(U12) ⊗ A ,

where both rows are short exact sequences of dg categories and the left vertical mor-
phism is an isomorphism. Since homotopy K-theory sends short exact sequences
of dg categories to homotopy coﬁber sequences of spectra (see [41, §5.3]), we then
conclude from (8.6) that the “back” square of (8.4) is homotopy cartesian.
(cid:3)

Remark 8.7.

(i) By applying Lemma 8.3 to perf dg(X) → perf dg(DX ), we con-
clude that it suﬃces to prove Proposition 8.1 in the particular case where
Y = Spec(B) is a smooth aﬃne k-scheme of ﬁnite type.

(ii) Lemma 8.3 holds mutatis mutandis without the smoothness assumption.

Step II: Reduction to the aﬃne case in the second variable. Given a dg
category A, consider the induced morphism

βX : KH(A ⊗ perf dg(X)) −→ KH(A ⊗ perf dg(DX )) .

Lemma 8.8. If βX is invertible when X = Spec(A) is a smooth aﬃne k-scheme
of ﬁnite type, then βX is invertible for every smooth k-scheme as in Theorem 3.6.

Proof. In order to simplify the exposition, let KH(A; X) := KH(A ⊗ perfdg(X));
similarly with X replaced by DX . Let X′ be a smooth k-scheme of ﬁnite type,
i : Z ֒→ X′ a smooth closed subscheme, and j : U ֒→ X′ the open complement of Z.
On the one hand, since homotopy K-theory is A1-homotopy invariant and sends
short exact sequences of dg categories to homotopy coﬁber sequences, [48, Thm. 1.9
and Rk. 1.11(G2)] yields an homotopy coﬁber sequence of spectra

KH(A; Z)

i∗−→ KH(A; X′)

j∗
−→ KH(A; U ) .

On the other hand, as explained by Drinfeld-Gaitsgory in [15, §3.1.4], we have a
short exact sequence of dg categories

perf dg(DZ )

idR,∗−→ perfdg(DX ′ )

j∗
−→ perf dg(DU ) .

Hence, as in the proof of Lemma 8.3, we obtain the homotopy coﬁber sequence

KH(A; DZ)

idR,∗−→ KH(A; DX ′)

j∗
−→ KH(A; DU ) .

In the particular case where X′ := X\Xj−1 and Z := Xj\Xj−1, the above (general)
considerations lead to the following commutative diagram:

(8.9)

KH(A; DXj\Xj−1 )
βXj \Xj−1

βX\Xj

KH(A; Xj\Xj−1)

/ KH(A; X\Xj−1)

i∗

j∗

/ KH(A; X\Xj) .

Making use of the commutative diagrams (8.9), of the ﬁltration (3.7), and of the
fact that Xj\Xj−1, 0 ≤ j ≤ r, are smooth aﬃne k-schemes of ﬁnite type, the proof
follows now from a descending induction argument on the index j.

(cid:3)

Remark 8.10. By applying Lemma 8.8 to the dg category perf dg(X), we conclude
that it suﬃces to prove Proposition 8.1 in the particular case where X = Spec(A)
is a smooth aﬃne k-scheme of ﬁnite type.

Step III: Aﬃne case. Let X = Spec(A) and Y = Spec(B) be two smooth aﬃne
k-schemes of ﬁnite type. Thanks to Remarks 8.7 and 8.10, the proof of Proposition
8.1 follows now from the following result:

Lemma 8.11. The induced morphism KH(B ⊗ A) → KH(B ⊗ DA), where DA
stands for the k-algebra of diﬀerential operators on A, is invertible.

Proof. Let us denote by T ∗X = Spec(C) be the cotangent bundle of X. Recall that
we have an increasing ﬁltration 0 = F−1DA ⊂ F0DA ⊂ · · · ⊂ FjDA ⊂ · · · ⊂ DA of
DA given by the order of the diﬀerential operators. In particular, F0DA = A. This
ﬁltration is exhaustive, i.e. DA = ∪∞j=−1FjDA, and the associated graded algebra
gr(DA) is isomorphic to C. Consequently, by applying the functor B ⊗ − to the
preceding ﬁltration we obtain an increasing exhaustive ﬁltration

0 = B ⊗ F−1DA ⊂ B ⊗ F0DA ⊂ · · · ⊂ B ⊗ Fj DA ⊂ · · · ⊂ B ⊗ DA

of B ⊗ DA with F0(B ⊗ DA) = B ⊗ A and gr(B ⊗ DA) ≃ B ⊗ C.

Since the aﬃne k-schemes X, Y , and T ∗X, are smooth and of ﬁnite type, the k-
algebras A, B, and C are Noetherian and of ﬁnite global dimension. Consequently,
the k-algebras B ⊗ A and B ⊗ C are also Noetherian and of ﬁnite global dimension.
Making use of Quillen’s work on the algebraic K-theory of ﬁltered rings (see [35,

§6 Thm. 7] and [18, Thm. 1.1]), we then conclude that the morphism K(B ⊗ A) →
K(B ⊗ DA), induced by the inclusion F0(B ⊗ DA) ⊂ B ⊗ DA, is invertible. Since the
k-algebras B⊗A and B⊗DA are regular Noetherian2, the proof follows now from the
canonical isomorphisms K(B ⊗ A) ≃ KH(B ⊗ A) and K(B ⊗ DA) ≃ KH(B ⊗ DA)
between algebraic K-theory and homotopy K-theory; see [53, Ex. 1.4].

GrZ(Ind(Vect(k, Q))) .

Recall also from §2 that H∗dRB(X) belongs to the full subcategory Grb
The proof of Theorem 4.2 is then a consequence of the following equalities

Z(Vect(k, Q)).

P nc(A)

:= P nc(forget((H∗dRB)nc(A)))
= P nc(forget(H∗dRB(X)))

= P nc(H∗dRB(X))
= φ(P(H∗dRB(X))) = φ(P(X)) ,

dRB(P1)⊗(−m)))
dRB(P1)⊗(−m)))

where (9.2) follows from the assumption (H∗dRB)nc(A) ≃ H∗dRB(X), (9.3) from ad-
junction (9.1), (9.4) from the fact that the functor H∗dRB(X)⊗− preserves arbitrary
direct sums, (9.5) from Lemma 9.7 below, and ﬁnally (9.6) from Lemma 9.10 below.
Lemma 9.7. For every object {(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z of Grb
equality of Z/2-graded k-algebras:

Z(Vect(k, Q)), we have an

P nc({(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z) = P nc(⊕m∈Z({(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z ⊗ H 2

dRB(P1)⊗(−m))) .

Proof. Let (V, W, ω) and (V ′W ′, ω′) be two objects of Vect(k, Q). In order to sim-
plify the exposition, let us denote by P (V, W, ω) + P (V ′, W ′, ω′) the set of complex
numbers of the form p+p′, with p ∈ P (V, W, ω) and p′ ∈ P (V ′, W ′, ω′). Recall from
§2 that H 2
dRB(P1)⊗(−m) is the shifted triple (k, Q, ·(2πi)−m)[−2m]. Consequently,
the nth component of {(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z ⊗ H 2
(Vn+2m, Wn+2m, ωn+2m) ⊗ (k, Q, (2πi)−m) .
(9.8)
Similarly, the nth component of ⊕m∈Z({(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z ⊗ H 2
(9.9)
Note that since {(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z belongs to Grb
Z(Vect(k, Q)), the direct sum (9.9)
is ﬁnite. On the one hand, we have P ((9.8)) = P (Vn+2m, Wn+2m, ωn+2m)(2πi)−m.

⊕m∈Z (Vn+2m, Wn+2m, ωn+2m) ⊗ (k, Q, (2πi)−m) .

dRB(P1)⊗(−m) is given by

dRB(P1)⊗(−m)) is

On the other hand, P ((9.9)) = +m∈ZP (Vn+2m, Wn+2m, ωn+2m)(2πi)−m; see [19,
Prop. 9.2.4]. Consequently, the following equalities

∪n∈ZP (⊕m∈Z(V2(n+m), W2(n+m), ω2(n+m)) ⊗ (k, Q, (2πi)−m))(2πi)−n

= ∪n∈Z(+m∈ZP (V2(n+m), W2(n+m), ω2(n+m))(2πi)−m)(2πi)−n
= ∪n∈Z(+m∈ZP (V2(n+m), W2(n+m), ω2(n+m))(2πi)−(n+m))

allow us to conclude that every degree 0 (resp. degree 1) generator of the Z/2-
dRB(P1)⊗(−m))) is a k-linear
graded k-algebra P nc(⊕m∈Z({(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z ⊗ H 2
combination of degree 0 (resp. degree 1) generators of the Z/2-graded k-algebra
P nc({(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z). This implies that these two algebras are the same.
(cid:3)
Lemma 9.10. For every object {(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z of Grb
equality of Z/2-graded k-algebras:

Z(Vect(k, Q)), we have an

P nc({(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z) = φ(P({(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z)) .

(9.11)
Proof. Recall from §4 that the Z-graded k-algebra P({(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z) is gener-
ated in degree 2n by the elements of the set P (V2n, W2n, ω2n) and in degree 2n + 1
by the elements of the set P (V2n+1, W2n+1, ω2n+1). Via the description (4.1) of the
Z/2-graded k-algebra C2πi
Z/2, the image of P (V2n, W2n, ω2n) under the quotient homo-
morphism φ : C[t, t−1] ։ C2πi
Z/2 corresponds to the subset P (V2n, W2n, ω2n)(2πi)−n ⊆
C0. Similarly, the image of P (V2n+1, W2n+1, ω2n+1) under φ corresponds to the sub-
set P (V2n+1, W2n+1, ω2n+1)(2πi)−n ⊆ C1. By deﬁnition of P nc({(Vn, Wn, ωn)}n∈Z),
we then obtain the searched equality (9.11).
