Plasmons in van der Waals heterostructures comprised of graphene and related layered materials
demonstrate deep subwavelength conﬁnement and large propagation length. In this letter, we show
that graphene-insulator-graphene tunnel structures can serve as plasmonic gain media. The gain
stems from the stimulated electron tunneling accompanied by the emission of coherent plasmons
under interlayer population inversion. The probability of tunneling with plasmon emission appears
to be resonantly large at certain values of frequency and interlayer voltage corresponding to the
transitions between electron states with collinear momenta – a feature unique to the linear band
structure of graphene. The dispersion of plasmons undergoes a considerable transformation due to
the tunneling as well, demonstrating negative group velocity in several frequency ranges.

The ultrarelativistic nature of electrons in graphene
gives rise to the uncommon properties of their collective
excitations – surface plasmons (SPs) [1–3]. The deep sub-
wavelength conﬁnement [2], the unconventional density
dependence of frequency [3, 4], and the absence of Lan-
dau damping [4] are probably their most well-known fea-
tures. Among more sophisticated predictions there stand
the existence of transverse electric plasmon modes [5] and
quasi-neutral electron-hole sound at the charge neutral-
ity [6, 7]. It was not until the discovery of van der Waals
heterostructures that the truly low-loss SPs supported
by graphene with propagation length to wavelength ra-
tio reaching 25 could be observed [8]. The respective SP
damping rate is order of 0.5 ps, and it can be potentially
compensated by the plasma instabilities [9, 10] or stimu-
lated plasmon emission in pumped samples [11, 12].

In this letter, we demonstrate theoretically that
the resonant tunneling structures comprised of parallel
graphene layers can act as plasmonic gain media by them-
selves. Apparently, the negative diﬀerential resistance
(NDR) in tunnel diodes can give rise to the self-oscillation
in electrical circuits, but the extension of this concept to
the self-excitation of plasmons is not trivial [13–15]. In
addition, the weak NDR observed in the static current-
voltage curves of graphene tunnel diodes is insuﬃcient to
replenish the plasmon losses, which calls for the stabil-
ity of electron plasma [16]. However, the dynamic and
non-local eﬀects in the tunnel conductivity can radically
change the picture of plasmon propagation.

We calculate the dynamic tunnel conductivity of dou-
ble graphene layer biased by voltage V and show that its
real part is negative at frequencies ω < eV /, which is a
consequence of the interlayer population inversion. More
surprisingly, the negative tunnel conductivity possesses
sharp resonances at certain frequencies and wave vectors
q, despite the absence of any quantum-conﬁned subbands

lated in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) overlaid by the image

in the structure. Instead, the resonances emerge due to
the prolonged tunneling interaction between the states
with collinear momenta in neighboring graphene layers.
The singularities in the tunnel conductivity emerge at a
series of lines on the ω − q plane, whose pattern is espe-
cially rich in the presence of interlayer twist. At ﬁnite
bias V , the dispersion of acoustic SPs does not develop a
low-frequency tunnel gap, as opposed to SPs in coupled
layers of massive electrons in equilibrium [17]. Instead,
the SP spectrum develops an anticrossing with the tun-
nel resonances and demonstrates the parts with negative
group velocity. At the same time, the dispersion passes
quite close to the tunnel resonances, and the tunneling
gain can exceed the plasmon loss due to both inter- and
intraband SP absorption.

We start with the generalization of the acoustic plas-
mon dispersion law [18, 19] accounting for the tun-
neling [17] between parallel layers of electrically doped
graphene shown in Fig. 1. For equal electron and hole

doping of opposite layers, the dispersion equation reads

where d and κ are the thickness and permittivity of inter-
layer dielectric, σk is the in-plane graphene conductivity,
and G⊥ is the tunnel conductivity, the proportionality
coeﬃcient between the tunnel current density and the
interlayer voltage drop [units: Ohm−1m−2].

An only missing ingredient required for the analysis
of surface plasmon modes is the expression for the high-
frequency non-local tunnel conductivity G⊥(q, ω). The
theoretical studies of the latter have been limited to the
DC [20, 21] or local (q = 0) AC cases [22]. Here, we
consider the linear response of voltage-biased graphene
layers to the propagating acoustic plasmon whose electric
potential δϕ(z)eiqx−iωt is highly nonuniform (see inset in
Fig. 1). The electrons in tunnel-coupled graphene layers
are described with the tight-binding Hamiltonian

is the voltage-induced energy spacing between the Dirac
points, ˆp is the in-plane momentum operator, ˆI is the
identity matrix, and ˆT = Ω ˆI is the tunneling matrix.
Such model of tunnel couping applies to the AA-aligned
graphene layers [20, 23]; the eﬀects of layer twist will be
brieﬂy addressed in the end of paper.

The evaluation of interlayer conductivity is based on
the solution of the quantum Liouville equation for the
electron density matrix followed by the evaluation of the
expectation value of the current operator. The calcu-
lations are conveniently performed in the basis of ˆH0 -
eigenstates labelled by the in-plane momentum p, the
index s = {c, v} for the conduction and valence bands,
respectively, and the number l = ±1 governing the z-
localization of the wave function (Supporting informa-
tion, Sec. II). At strong bias, ∆ ≫ Ω, the state with
l = +1 (−1) is localized primarily on the top (bottom)
layer. Upon lowering the bias, the state with l = +1
(−1) becomes odd (even) with respect to x. The states’

The outlined scheme leads us to the following expres-

formation, Sec. III):

The ﬁrst peculiarity of Eq. (4) worth discussing is the
negative value of the real part of tunnel conductivity at
frequencies ω < eV /. This negativity implies that the
interlayer transitions accompanied by the emission of the
ﬁeld quantum (ω, q) are more probable than the inverse
absorptive transitions. The band ﬁlling providing the
negative tunnel conductivity can be viewed as an inter-
layer population inversion similar to that in the quantum
cascade lasers [27, 28]. The frequency- and wave vec-
tor dependence of 2ReG⊥/q2 is shown in Fig. 2A, where
the ’cold’ colors stand for the negative and ’warm’ col-
ors for the positive conductivity. An analysis of energy-
momentum conservation reveals distinct regions on the
frequency-wave vector plane, where diﬀerent types of
tunnel transitions with emission or absorption of the ﬁeld
quantum are relevant, see Fig. 2C. Among those, the
most pronounced is the interlayer intraband emission al-
lowed within the quadrant qv0 ≥ | ˜∆/ − ω|. The inter-
band transitions are generally weaker due to the small
overlap of chiral wave functions of diﬀerent bands [29]
(see Supporting information, Sec. IV for analytical ap-
proximations to the tunnel conductivity).

A distinct feature of the tunnel conductivity readily ob-
served in Fig. 2A is its large absolute value near a series
of lines qv0 = |ω ± ˜∆/|. The origin of these resonances
can be explained by analyzing the possible electron states
involved in plasmon-assisted tunneling at diﬀerent fre-
quencies and wave vectors, Fig. 2B. To be precise, we
focus on the interlayer intraband tunneling. Above the
resonance, at qv0 > ω − ˜∆/, the electrons capable of
tunneling occupy a hyperbolic cut of the mass shell in
graphene (case B3 in Fig. 2). With decreasing the fre-
quency and wave vector, the hyperbola degenerates into
a straight line (case B2). At this point, the tunneling
occurs between states with collinear momenta and equal
velocities – hence, their interaction would last for an in-
ﬁnitely long time were there no carrier scattering [30].
At even lower frequencies (case B1), the intraband tran-
sitions are impossible, but the weaker interband tunnel-
ing sets in.
In the absence of scattering, the collinear
tunneling singularities are square-root,

FIG. 3. Space-time dispersion of the eﬀective conductivity
Re[σk + 2G⊥/q2] governing the damping (or gain) of acous-
tic SPs. The values are normalized by e2/. The structure
parameters are the same as in Fig. 2. The contour of zero
conductivity is highlighted with red dashed line

The actual value of the resonant conductivity is lim-
ited by electron-acoustic phonon scattering at low elec-
tron energies [31]. We account for it by replacing the
delta-peaked spectral functions of individual electrons
in Eqs. (3) and (4) with Lorentz functions of proper
width [20]. With the scattering rate τ −1
tr ≃ (2 ÷ 8) ×
10−11 s−1 at T = 77 ÷ 300 K [32, 33] and electron den-
sity n = 5 × 1011 cm−2, the tunnel resonances remain
pronounced even at room temperature.

Were there no collinear singularities in the electron
tunneling,
its eﬀect on plasmon spectra and damping
would be small. The presence of resonances suggests the
possibility of the net plasmon gain and strong renormal-
ization of plasmon dispersion. The attenuated or ampli-
ﬁed character of SP propagation is governed by the sign
of the ’eﬀective conductivity’ Re[σk + 2G⊥/q2] plotted
in Fig. 3. The proximity of acoustic SP velocity to the
Fermi velocity at small d [4, 34] antagonizes the net gain
as both inter- and intraband absorption are large near
ω = qv0 [3] (at d = 2.5 nm, the velocity of SPs not per-
turbed by the tunneling is s ≈ 1.1v0). On the other hand,
a large ratio of transverse and in-plane electric ﬁelds in
the acoustic mode, E⊥/Ek = 2(qd)−1 ≫ 1 facilitates the
tunneling gain compared to the in-plane absorption. The
competition of these factors results in the emergence of
relatively broad frequency-wave vector ranges (encircled
by red lines in Fig. 3) where the real part of the eﬀective
conductivity is negative and the net SP gain is possible.

threshold of interlayer interband transitions are mirrored

which is proved by the virtue of Kramers-Kronig rela-
tions. A similar situation holds for the in-plane conduc-
tivity, whose imaginary part is positive and resonantly

twisted layers (twist angle θT = 0.57◦) propagating along

the positions of K-points in the reciprocal space for twisted

dependently in gated double layers. By ﬁxing ˜∆ and
increasing the carrier density, one can achieve a large en-
hancement of the SP velocity below the tunnel resonance,
as shown in Fig. 4B, and at some critical density the long-
wavelength branch of SP dispersion can disappear at all.
Such behaviour contrasts to the plasmons in coupled lay-
ers of massive electrons at equilibrium, where the large
negative value of ImG⊥ at ω < 2Ω result in a gapped
SP dispersion [17, 35]. In non-equilibrium, ImG⊥ is pos-
itive at small frequencies, and the gap does not appear.
At large level spacing, the eﬀects of plasmon gain and
spectrum renormalization are relevant just in a narrow
vicinity of the threshold of intraband tunneling. An in-
crease in the temperature leads to the further narrowing
of the ’gain window’. However, even at room tempera-
ture and relatively large bias (V = 0.3 V) there exists
a range of frequencies corresponding to the net SP gain
(solid part of orange line in Fig. 4B).

Finally, we brieﬂy address the eﬀects of rotational twist
of graphene layers manifesting itself in the relative shift
of the Dirac cones by the vectors ∆qi in the reciprocal
space (i = 1...6, the displacement vector for each of six
pairs of Dirac cones is rotated by π/3 with respect to the
next one). Neglecting the emerging small oﬀ-diagonal
elements of the T -matrix, one can prove that the tunnel
conductivity in the presence of twist GT
⊥(q, ω) is related
to the tunnel conductivity of the aligned layers via

In the presence of twist, the locus of collinear scattering
singularities on the ω − q plane breaks down into six hy-
perbolas (or less, for some particular angles between q
and ∆q). The acoustic plasmon dispersion develops an

respond to the damped and solid parts – to the ampliﬁed
plasmons. Black dashed line is ω = qv0

i.e.

large above the domain of Landau damping,
at
ω → qv0 + 0+. The interplay of two singular conductiv-
ities (in-plane and out-of-plane) results in the ’locking’
of the long-wavelength part of plasmon spectrum in the
domain (ω ≥ qv0)∪ (ω ≤ ˜∆/− qv0). This is clearly seen
in the plot of acoustic plasmon spectral function S(q, ω),
the imaginary part of the inverse of Eq. (1), Fig. 4A. With
increasing the frequency, the plasmon peak develops an
anticrossing with the resonance in the tunnel conductiv-
ity. The group velocity of acoustic SPs in the vicinity
of tunnel resonance is negative and close to −v0. Above
the resonance, the initially linear SP dispersion remains
almost unperturbed, though the excitations are still am-
pliﬁed but not attenuated.

The eﬀects of tunneling on SP dispersion are gener-
ally more pronounced at low levels’ spacing ˜∆ and high
carrier density n. These quantities can be addressed in-

anticrossing with each of hyperbolas, demonstrating sev-
eral frequency ranges with negative group velocity and
gain. An example of the spectral function for SP propa-
gating along ∆q in one pair of valleys is shown in Fig. 5
for |∆q|v0 = 18 meV (twist angle θT = 0.57◦). In this
example, there exist four curves corresponding to the sin-
gular plasmon gain and four for the singular absorption.
Remarkably, the plasmon gain in twisted layers for cer-
tain directions of propagation can be greater than that in
aligned layers, because the tunnel resonances can come
closer to the unperturbed SP dispersion. Generally, the
spectrum and gain of plasmons in twisted layers becomes
anisotropic with six-fold rotational symmetry.

The experimental observation of coherent plasmon am-
pliﬁcation in coupled graphene layers poses strong con-
straints on the tunnel transparency and quality of the
barrier layers. At the same time, the spontaneous emis-
sion of SPs upon tunneling [36, 37] is readily observable
for a wide class of dielectrics. The tunneling SP emis-
sion with their subsequent conversion into the free-space
electromagnetic modes upon scattering might explain the
observed terahertz electroluminescence from graphene-
hBN-graphene diodes [38]. The presence of luminescence
in Ref. [38] correlates with the presence of NDR in the
static I(V )-curve, which supports the tunneling origin
of the emission. The photon-assisted tunneling [22] may
also contribute to the observed emission, however, the
emission of photons carrying zero momentum is sup-
pressed in samples with even a slight interlayer twist.

In conclusion, we have theoretically demonstrated a
number of unique properties of surface plasmons in
tunnel-coupled voltage-biased graphene layers, including
the ampliﬁed propagation due to the resonant tunneling
under interlayer population inversion, and a strong renor-
malization of dispersion law. The pronounced eﬀect of
tunneling on both spectrum and damping of plasmons re-
sults from singularities in the tunnel conductivity which
are, in turn, inherited from the linear bands of graphene.
Our ﬁndings can set the basis for novel active plasmonic
devices based on van der Waals heterostructures, includ-
ing compact plasmon sources and spasers.

II. Electron states in tunnel-coupled layers

The tight-binding Hamiltonian of the tunnel-coupled
graphene layers in the absence of the propagating plas-
mon [ ˆH0 in Eq. (2)] constitutes the blocks describing
isolated graphene layers ˆHG± and the block describing
tunnel hopping ˆT . Such description of electron states
is common for graphene bilayer with possible interlayer
twist [23]. In more comprehensive theories, the ˆT -matrix
is aﬀected by the band structure of dielectric layer [20].
Here, for the sake of analytical traceability, we choose
the tunneling matrix in its simplest form which is appli-
cable to the AA-stacked perfectly aligned graphene bi-
layer, ˆT = Ω ˆI, where Ω can be interpreted as the tunnel
hopping frequency.
To estimate its value, we switch for a while from the
tight binding to the continuum description of electron
states in the z-direction. We model each graphene layer

with a delta-well [39]

III. Electron-plasmon interaction and solution of the

quantum Liouville equation

The presence of plasmon propagating along the double
graphene layer results in an additional potential energy
of electron

δ ˆV (r, t) = eδϕ(z)ei(qx−ωt),

(A24)

where we assume the direction of plasmon propagation
to be along the x-axis, and the dependence of potential
on the z-coordinate is given by Eqs. (A11) and (A12).
The additional terms in Hamiltonian due to the vector-
potential are negligible as far as the speed of light sub-
stantially exceeds the plasmon velocity.

With our choice of the tight-binding basis functions as
those localized on a deﬁnite layer and on a deﬁnite lattice
cite, we shall require 16 matrix elements of the potential
energy (A24) connecting those basis states. However,
it is more convenient to work out the matrix elements
of (A24) connecting the eigen states of Hamiltonian (2).
The good quantum numbers of these states are the in-
plane momentum p, the band index s = ±1 (+1 for the
conduction band and −1 for the valence band) and the l

and, obviously, S−− = −S++, S± = S∓.
The dependence of the overlap factors S++ and S±
on the interlayer potential drop ∆ is shown in Fig. A4.
We note that these overlap factors weakly depend on the
plasmon wave vector q as far as it is much smaller than
electron wave function decay constant kb. In this approx-
imation, one can set s(z) ≈ 2z/d for |z| < d/2, s(z) ≈ 1
at z < −d/2, and s(z) ≈ 1 at z > d/2.
Having obtained the matrix elements of electron-
plasmon interaction, we pass to the solution of the quan-
tum Liuoville equation for the electron density matrix
ˆρ.
In the linear response, the latter is decomposed as
ˆρ = ˆρ(0) + δ ˆρ, where δ ˆρ emerges due to the plasmon ﬁeld.
This component of the density matrix is found from

sis of ˆH0. In this basis, the commutator

We note that a diﬀerent choice of the zero-order density
matrix also leads to the emergence of the negative tunnel
conductivity, with a larger coeﬃcient in front of G⊥.

The subsequent calculation of the in-plane and tunnel
conductivities is based on the following relations. From

The ﬁrst-order correction δ ˆρ is now expressed through
the density matrix in the absence of plasmon ﬁeld ˆρ(0).
A particular choice of ˆρ(0) requires the solution of ki-
netic equation in the voltage-biased tunnel-coupled lay-
ers, however, in several limiting cases the situation is
greatly simpliﬁed [27]. If the tunneling rate Ω is slower
than the electron energy relaxation rate νε (e.g., due
to phonons and carrier-carrier scattering), the quasi-
equilibrium distribution function is established in each
In this situation, ˆρ(0) is diagonal in

and bottom layers its elements being the respective Fermi
distribution functions. In the other limiting case, when
tunneling is stronger than scattering (Ω ≫ νε), the elec-
tron is ’collectivized’ by the two layers, and the den-
sity matrix ˆρ(0) is approximately diagonal in the basis
of ˆH0-eigenstates. For the parameters used in our calcu-
lations, Ω ≈ 10 meV exceeds the relaxation rate ν ≈ 1
meV, and the latter limiting case is justiﬁed. Setting

Due to the linear dependence of δ ˆρ on the plasmon
potential amplitude δϕ0, the average time derivative of
the charge density in Eq. (A34) is also a linear func-
tion of δϕ0. The proportionality coeﬃcient, according to
Eq. (A32), is the sought-for combination of conductivities
q2σk + 2G⊥. The terms in the sum, Eq. (A34), with non-
equal l-indices are related to the tunnel conductivity, and
those with equal l-indices – to the in-plane conductivity.
Actually, the distinction between in-plane and tun-
nel conductivity is meaningful only in the case of weak
In the this case
coupling (or strong bias ∆ ≫ Ω).
S++ cos θM → 1, and Eq. (3) yields the conductivity
of a single graphene layer [40].
In the same limit, the
tunnel conductivity, Eq. (4) possesses a small prefactor
S± sin θM ∝ e−2kbd, where kb is the decay constant of the
electron wave function. In the opposite case of weak bias
Ω & ∆, the notions of in-plane and tunnel conductivities
lose their meaning as the states of individual layers are
highly mixed [17]. Ultimately, at zero bias, σk vanishes,

which reﬂects the impossibility of electron transitions be-
tween states with the same z-symmetry under the per-
turbation odd in z.

However, even in the case of strong bias ∆ ≫ Ω, the
in-plane conductivity of tunnel-coupled layers responding
to the plasmon ﬁeld is renormalized compared to its value
for a single isolated layer in uniform ﬁeld σ0, namely

σk = S++ cos θM σ0.

(A35)

The factor S++ < 1 comes from the broadening of the
electron cloud beyond a single layer and non-uniformity
of the plasmon ﬁeld. Loosely speaking, a part of the
electron wave function feels the reduced magnitude of the
plasmon ﬁeld Ek outside of graphene layer. The factor
cos θM < 1 comes from the mixing of electron states in
individual layers forming the state with deﬁnite value of
l.

IV. Analytical approximations to the in-plane and

tunnel conductivity

Despite a complex structure of Eqs. (3) and (4), sev-
eral analytical approximations can be made in the fre-
quency range of interest ω < 2εF , where the plasmons
are weakly damped – at least, for the real part of conduc-
tivity that determines absorption or gain. For brevity, in
this section we work with ’god-given units’  = v0 ≡ 1
We start with the evaluation of in-plane interband con-
ductivity associated with the electron transitions from
the valence band to the conduction band

To proceed further, we note that in the domain of in-

the diﬀerence of distribution functions is a smooth func-
tion of v, while the prefactor sin2 v varies strongly. This
allows us to integrate sin2 v exactly, and replace the dif-
ference of distribution functions with its angular average.

that electrons in diﬀerent layers have diﬀerent chemical

Similar to the real part of the interband absorption, the
intraband absorption is generally larger in the non-local
case q 6= 0 compared to the local case. This diﬀerence
is illustrated in Fig. (A5), where the local (q = 0) and
non-local expressions at the acoustic plasmon dispersion
(q = ω/s) are compared. This result is in agreement with
the recent measurements of plasmon propagation length
in graphene on hBN: the local Drude formula underes-
timated the plasmon damping, and the account of non-
locality was crucial to explain the experimental data [31].
Finally, we provide the analytical estimates for the in-
traband tunnel conductivity, which mainly governs the

The approximation (A51) corresponds to the neglect of
vertex corrections in the current-current correlator repre-
sented by the bubble diagram. Moreover, the interlayer
electron-phonon interactions are neglected. While these
assumptions can be hardly justiﬁed, they do not aﬀect
much the calculated plasmon spectral functions and dis-
persions because the plasmon spectra do not enter the do-
main of singular conductivity. Nevertheless, the account
of scattering in a more consistent manner may lead to
the new results. As example, Kazarinov and Suris have
shown that the interference of scattering events in diﬀer-
ent layers can lead to a suﬃcient decrease in the eﬀective
collision frequency governing the width of resonances in
dynamic tunnel conductivity [27]. This eﬀective collision
frequency should be much less than transport collision
frequency and, a fortiori, the relaxation frequency. The
extension of their results to the case of plasmon-assisted
tunneling will be the subject of the future work.
