Abstract

We investigate the ΛΛ and K− p intensity correlations in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. First,
we examine the dependence of the ΛΛ correlation on the ΛΛ interaction and the ΛΛ pair purity
probability λ. For small λ, the correlation function needs to be suppressed by the ΛΛ interaction
in order to explain the recently measured ΛΛ correlation data. By comparison, when we adopt
the λ value evaluated from the experimentally measured Σ0/Λ ratio, the correlation function
needs to be enhanced by the interaction. We demonstrate that these two cases correspond to the
two analyses which gave opposite signs of the ΛΛ scattering length. Next, we discuss the K− p
correlation function. By using the local ¯KN potential which reproduces the kaonic hydrogen data
by SIDDHARTA, we obtain the K− p correlation function. We ﬁnd that the K− p correlation can
provide a complementary information with the K− p elastic scattering amplitude.

1. Introduction

Interactions between hadrons are basic ingredients in nuclear and hadron physics. We need
nucleon-nucleon (NN), hyperon-nucleon (YN) and hyperon-hyperon (YY) interactions to theo-
retically investigate normal nuclear and hypernuclear structure and nuclear matter equation of
state (EOS). ΛΛ interaction is one of the key interactions in exotic hadron physics and neutron
star physics. First, ΛΛ interaction is closely related to the existence of the dihyperon, the H par-
ticle (uuddss). While it seems improbable that there is bound H state below the ΛΛ threshold,
H may exist as a loosely bound state or as a resonance state. The deeply bound H [1] was ruled
out by the observation of the double Λ hypernucleus 6
ΛΛHe in the Nagara event [2, 3], and the
upper bound of loosely bound H production is found to be very small; it is much lower than the
anti-deuteron (Υ(1S , 2S ) → ¯dX) production at the KEKB e+e− collider [4], and much lower than

various theoretical predictions [5] at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN [6]. By comparison,
a bump structure above the ΛΛ threshold was observed [7], and recently performed ab-initio
calculations show the existence of the bound H at least in the SU(3) limit with unphysical quark
masses [8, 9]. The H around the ΛΛ threshold should have the molecule nature of ΛΛ, and in-
formation on ΛΛ interaction is decisive. ΛΛ interaction is also important in neutron star physics,
especially to solve the ”hyperon puzzle”. Hyperons are expected to appear in the core of heavy
neutron stars, whereas the hyperonic equations of state of neutron star matter are generally too
soft to support 2M⊙ neutron stars [10]. If the ΛΛ interaction is repulsive enough at high densities,
it may be possible to support massive neutron stars. Contrary to its importance, information on
the ΛΛ interaction is very limited. There is only one uniquely identiﬁed double Λ hypernucleus,
6
ΛΛHe, observed in Nagara event [2, 3]. The bond energy ∆BΛΛ provides precious information,
but it is not enough to determine the shape of the ΛΛ potential.

Recent developments in exotic hadron physics demand deeper understanding of meson-
baryon (MB) and meson-meson (MM) interactions. There have been exciting developments
in the spectroscopy of hadron resonances, starting with the discovery of DsJ(2317) [11] and
X(3872) [12] in the charmed meson sector. Recently, new states are also observed in the bot-
c (4380) and
tom sector, such as Z±b (10610) and Z±b (10650) [13] and in the baryon sector, P+
c (4450) [14]. These states cannot be explained by the simple quark model and are considered to
P+
be candidates of exotic hadrons. Among others, the hadronic molecules are closely related to the
hadron-hadron interactions. One of the typical examples of hadronic molecules is the Λ(1405)
baryon resonance which appears near the ¯KN threshold. It is considered as a ¯KN quasi-bound
state in the ¯KN-πΣ coupled-channel analyses [15, 16] (see Refs. [17, 18] for recent reviews). The
structure of Λ(1405) is closely related to the strength and energy dependence of the I = 0 ¯KN
interaction. The uncertainty of the ¯KN scattering amplitude at around the threshold is reduced
by the high precision data of the kaonic hydrogen by SIDDHARTA [19] combined with the K− p
scattering data [20, 21]. Because the low energy K− p scattering data was accumulated by old
bubble chamber experiments with relatively large experimental uncertainties, new and accurate
information is desired to further sharpen the description of the ¯KN amplitude. Precise knowledge
of the ¯KN interaction is also important to study possible bound states of ¯K in nuclei [22, 23].

One of the observables to get information on hadron-hadron (hh) interaction is the two hadron
intensity correlation [24, 25, 26, 27]. Two hadron intensity correlation is generated mainly by
quantum statistics, known as the Hanbury Brown, Twiss (HBT) [28] or Goldhaber, Goldhaber,
Lee, Pais (GGLP) [29] eﬀects, and the ﬁnal state interaction (FSI) [24, 25]. One expects sub-
stantial dependence of the correlation function on the pairwise hh interaction, provided that the
interaction is suﬃciently strong in the range comparable to the eﬀective source size [24, 25]. Re-
cently, ΛΛ correlation in high-energy heavy-ion collisions has been measured at the Relativistic
Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory [30]. Theoretical analysis of
data implies that the ΛΛ interaction is weakly attractive and there is no loosely bound state [31].
By comparison, another analysis suggests that ΛΛ interaction is weakly repulsive or there is a
loosely bound state [30]. Resolving this contradiction is an important step to utilize hh correla-
tion as a tool to extract hh interaction. If it is successful, we can apply the same method to other
hh correlation. Speciﬁcally, K− p correlation is a good candidate. Both of K− and p are long-
lived charged particles and abundantly produced in heavy-ion collisions, then it is possible to
measure the correlation function precisely. The correlation function measurement will provide a
further constraint on the ¯KN interaction, in combination with the accumulated data of the kaonic
hydrogen and the K− p scattering.

In this article, we investigate the ΛΛ and K− p correlations in heavy-ion collisions. We ﬁrst

2

examine the dependence of the ΛΛ correlation on the pair purity parameter λ and the scattering
length a0. The HBT correlation for ΛΛ with the pair purity probability λ reads CΛΛ(q → 0) =
1 − λ/2 at small relative momentum q, and the STAR data show CΛΛ(q → 0) ≃ 0.82. When λ
is close to unity, the HBT correlation function approaches CΛΛ ≃ 0.5, and thus the interaction
should be attractive to explain the observed enhanced correlation. For small λ, on the other hand,
the HBT correlation function becomes close to unity and the interaction needs to suppress the
correlation. We demonstrate that the choice of the λ parameter is the origin of the diﬀerence
between the results in Ref. [30] and Ref. [31]. In the former, λ is regarded as a free parameter
and the optimal value is found to be small, then the positive scattering length a0 > 0 (decreasing
phase shift) is favored. In the latter, λ is evaluated by using measured data [40, 41], and the
favored scattering length is found to be a0 < 0 (increasing phase shift). Next we discuss the K− p
correlation function. The ¯KN scattering has two components, I = 0 and I = 1 in the isospin
basis and K− p and ¯K0n in the charge basis. We thus write down the correlation function formula
in the case of coupled-channel scattering. To predict the correlation function, we adopt the ¯KN
potential developed in Ref. [42] which reproduces the scattering amplitude [20, 21]. We also
examine the dependence of the correlation function with respect to the details of the potential.

This article is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we brieﬂy summarize the correlation function
formalism. In Sec. 3, we discuss the ΛΛ correlation function and its dependence on ΛΛ interac-
tion. In Sec. 4, we discuss the K− p correlation in heavy-ion collisions. We summarize our work
in Sec. 5.

2. Hadron-Hadron Correlation Function in Heavy-Ion Collisions and Its Relation to Inter-

action

2.1. Correlation Function

Two-hadron intensity correlation from a chaotic source is given in the Koonin-Pratt (KP)

formula [24],

C(q, P) =R d4x1d4x2S 1(x1, p1)S 2(x2, p2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Ψ(−)(r, q)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

,

where S i(x, p) (i = 1, 2) is the source function of the hadron i of momentum p, q = (m2p1 −
m1p2)/(m1 + m2) is the relative momentum, P = p1 + p2 is the center-of-mass momentum, r
is the relative coordinate with time diﬀerence correction, and Ψ(−) is the relative wave function
in the two-body outgoing state with an asymptotic relative momentum q. In the case where we
can ignore the time diﬀerence of the emission and the momentum dependence of the source, we
integrate out the center-of-mass coordinate and obtain Eq. (2), where S 12(r) is the normalized
source function in the relative coordinate.

We assume here that only s-wave part of the wave function is modiﬁed by the hadronic

interaction. For ΛΛ, the relative wave function is given as

ΛΛ = √2χs(cid:2)cos(q · r) + ψΛΛ(r) − j0(qr)(cid:3) + √2iχt sin(q · r) ,

where χs and χt show the spin part of the wave function in spin-singlet and spin-triplet, respec-
tively, j0 is the spherical Bessel function, and ψΛΛ is the spatial part of the relative wave function

where S 12(r) = r2 exp(−r2/4R2)/2 √πR3 and we take the spin average of |Ψ(−)|2. The second

term arises from the HBT [28] (or GGLP [29]) eﬀect which suppresses the correlation due to
the anti-symmetrization of the wave function for spin-half fermions. The third term shows the
interaction eﬀects; when the wave function is enhanced due to the attraction, the correlation is
enhanced accordingly.

For K− p, we consider the following wave function in the K− p channel,

Ψ

(−)
K− p = exp(iq · r) + ψK− p(r) − j0(qr) ,

(6)
where ψK− p is the s-wave relative wave function with the outgoing boundary condition. The
relative momentum is deﬁned by q = (MpkK − mK−kp)/(mK− + Mp) with kK− (kp) being the
momentum of K− (p). We ignore the Coulomb interaction in this work. The correlation function
is calculated to be

It should be noted that there is no (anti-)symmetrization of the wave function.

Since K− p couples with ¯K0n, we need to take care of the channel coupling. With the isospin

2.2. Lednicky and Lyuboshits Model

In order to examine the interaction dependence of the correlation function, an analytic model
developed by Lednicky and Lyuboshits (LL) [25] is useful. In the LL model, the correlation
function is obtained by using the asymptotic wave function and the eﬀective range correction,
then it is given in terms of the scattering amplitude and the eﬀective range. We consider here the
following asymptotic wave function,

where f (q) = (S − 1)/2iq. We can evaluate the integral in the KP formula for ψasy as
F2(x)

dr S 12(r)|ψasy(r)|2 =
where x = 2qR, F1(x) = R x
/x and F2(x) = (1 − e−x2)/x, and we have utilized the
0 dte−t2+2ixt = √πe−x2
relation R ∞
/2 + ixF1(x). We ﬁnd that the function F1 is well approximated
in the form F1(x) = (1 + c1x2 + c2x4 + c3x6)/(1 + (c1 + 2/3)x2 + c4x4 + c5x6 + c3x8) with
(c1, · · · , c5) = (0.123, 0.0376, 0.0107, 0.304, 0.0617) in the x range of interest, 0 < x < 20 [43].
In the single channel case, The deviation from the asymptotic wave function at small q can be
obtained by using the eﬀective range formula [48],

The integral in the left hand side of Eq. (14) gives the correction to the LL model formula, when
we multiply a factor e−r2/4R2 to the integrand. We expect that the factor does not change the
integral much as long as R is large enough compared with the interaction range. Under this
assumption, we can evaluate the eﬀective range correction. By using Eqs. (13) and (14), we
arrive at the interaction dependent part of the correlation function in the LL model,

the formula given in Ref. [25], one assumes ψ(−) = (ψ(+))∗ and |S| = 1, then the f is the actual
scattering amplitude and the last term in Eq. (15) does not exist.

(16)

We note that there is no open channel and |S| = 1 for ΛΛ at small q, then the last term in
Eq. (15) disappears.
In Fig. 1, we show the ΛΛ correlation function in the LL model as a
function of the source size R and the reciprocal of the scattering length 1/a0 for R = 2 fm and
reﬀ = 5 fm. It should be noted that we take the “nuclear physics” convention for the scattering
length, q cot δ = −1/a0 + reﬀq2/2 + O(q4), which leads to δ ≃ −a0q at low energy. When |a0|
is small, the correlation function is approximately described by the HBT term, and converges

5

to 0.5 at q → 0. In the negative a0 case (attractive potential without loosely bound states), the
correlation function is enhanced especially at small q, because of the enhanced wave function by
the attraction. We note that the correlation is generally suppressed when the scattering length is
positive; Positive a0 means that there is a shallow bound state or the interaction is repulsive, then
the squared wave function is suppressed by the node or by the repulsion. Thus the correlation
function is sensitive to the ΛΛ interaction, as long as other eﬀects do not wash out the above
trend.

and reﬀ = 5 fm as an example. In the white areas, the correlation function is greater than 2 or less than 0.

As for the K− p correlation function in the LL model, we use the wave function in the K− p

channel, Eq. (11), and ﬁnd the correlation function is obtained as

K− p(q) =1 + ∆CLL(q, S → ˜SK− p, f → ˜f , F3 → 1) ,
CLL

(17)

where ∆CLL(q) is given in Eq. (15) with F3 = 1. It should be noted again that the “scattering
amplitude” ˜f = ( ˜SK− p − 1)/2iq used in ∆CLL is not the scattering amplitude in K− p → K− p
scattering, fK− p. The scattering amplitude of K− p is given as fK− p = ( f0 + f1)/2, where the the
isospin base scattering amplitudes are given as SI = e2iδI = 1 + 2iq fI. Only when the scattering
amplitudes are small q| fI| ≪ 1, ˜f approximately matches with fK− p.

3. ΛΛ Correlation

In this section, ﬁrst we summarize the results given in Ref. [31], where we have investigated
the ΛΛ correlation and interaction and have concluded that a0 < 0. Next we discuss the origin
of diﬀerences between the results in Ref. [31] and those by the STAR collaboration [30], where
the sign of the scattering length is found to be diﬀerent from ours.

Upper panel shows the result from the static spherical source and cylindrical source including ﬂow eﬀects with the
fss2 [32] ΛΛ interaction. Lower panel shows the results for the cylindrical source including ﬂow, residual source, and
feed-down eﬀects. We also show the Lednicky-Lyuboshits model results.

In Ref. [31], we have analyzed the ΛΛ correlation data recently obtained at RHIC by the
STAR collaboration [30], by using the KP formula for the correlation function given in Eq. (1).
We have calculated the wave function with several ΛΛ interactions proposed so far. In the upper
panel of Fig. 2, we show the correlation function obtained with fss2 ΛΛ interaction [32] and a
static spherical source, as an example. We have searched for the optimal source size, and have
found R = 1.2 fm. Because of the attraction, the correlation function is enhanced from the free
results (dotted line), and approximately explains the data. We can take account of the collective
ﬂow eﬀects by modifying the source function in the KP formula. The boost-invariant (Bjorken)
expansion is assumed for the longitudinal ﬂow, and the transverse ﬂow strength is ﬁxed by ﬁtting

7

the transverse momentum spectrum of Λ. The optimal transverse source size is found to be
RT ≃ 0.7 fm. We show the results with ﬂow eﬀects in the upper panel of Fig. 2 (open circles).
The source is eﬀectively elongated in the longitudinal direction, then the correlation appears
more strongly in the small q region albeit with the smaller transverse size. This captures the
feature found in the data.

Contours show χ2/DOF = 0.56 (free λ, solid contour) and χ2/DOF = 0.65 (λ = (0.67)2, dashed contour). Filled black
circle with xy error bar shows the analysis result by the STAR collaboration, where λ is regarded as a free parameter [30].

We have performed the same analysis using several ΛΛ interactions; Boson exchange poten-
tials (ND, NF, NSC89, NSC97, ESC08, Ehime) [33, 34, 35, 36] and Nijmegen-based potentials
ﬁtted to the Nagara data (FG,HKMYY) [37, 38, 39], in addition to the quark model potential
(fss2) [32]. Low energy scattering parameters (a0, reﬀ) of these potentials are plotted in Fig. 3.
The chi-square generally becomes better with ﬂow eﬀects (χ2
min/DOF ∼ 1.5) at the optimal trans-
verse source size (RT = (0.7 − 1.1) fm) and ΛΛ potentials with −1.8 fm−1 < 1/a0 < 0.8 fm−1
and 3.5 fm < reﬀ < 7 fm are found to give reasonable ﬁt to the data (χ2/DOF < 5). This region
of scattering parameters are marked by the grey area in Fig. 3.

The above results are not yet satisfactory in two points. First, we have not taken account
of Λ emission from the decay of long-lived particles. The discussion so far applies to the case
where Λ particles are directly emitted from the hot matter. Feed-down from short-lived hyperon
resonances can be taken into account by modifying the source size, and weak decay from Ξ and Ω
can be rejected by using the distance of closest approach to the primary vertex [30]. By contrast,
we cannot reject Λ from Σ0, which decays electromagnetically. Second, the optimal transverse
source size is much smaller than that expected from the HBT analyses of other hadrons. In the
STAR data, we ﬁnd that the ΛΛ correlation function is suppressed signiﬁcantly even at high
relative momentum region, q ∼ 0.2 GeV. This high-momentum tail may suggest the existence
of unknown smaller-size source, referred to as the ”residual” source [30], and makes the favored

8

source size smaller.

We have taken account of the feed down eﬀects and the residual source eﬀects by modifying

the correlation function as follows,

Ccorr(q) = 1 + λ(Cbare(q) − 1) + arese−4r2

resq2

,

(18)

where Cbare(q) is given in the KP or LL formula, Eq. (1) or Eq. (15). The pair purity probability
λ receives an apparent reduction when signiﬁcant part of Λ comes from Σ0 → γΛ. As a result,
the deviation from unity (C − 1) is suppressed. The last term represents the modiﬁcation by the
residual source. We have adopted the pair purity λ = (0.67)2 = ((1 − 0.278 − 0.15)/(1 − 0.15))2
based on the observed ratio Σ0/Λtot = 0.278 [40] and Ξ/Λtot = 0.15 [41], where Λtot represents
Λ yield including decay contributions. While the above Σ0/Λ ratio is measured in a diﬀerent
reaction, it is close to the statistical model estimate and small modiﬁcation of λ does not change
our conclusion. We regard ares and rres as free parameters. In the lower panel of Fig. 2, we show
the results with ﬂow, feed-down, and residual source eﬀects in addition to quantum statistics
and ΛΛ interaction eﬀects. We show the results with recent ΛΛ interactions; fss2, ESC08, FG
and HKMYY. When we optimize ares and rres, we ﬁnd that χ2/DOF ≃ 1 is achieved in the
transverse size range RT > 0.5 fm, and we show the results with RT = 2.5 fm. Unfortunately,
the correlation function becomes less sensitive to the ΛΛ interaction. No diﬀerence is seen in
the momentum region q > 0.1 GeV/c, where the residual source contribution dominates. At
low q, the correlation function shows weak but non-negligible sensitivity to the ΛΛ interaction.
We ﬁnd that ΛΛ interaction with 1/a0 < −0.8 fm−1, marked by the yellow area in Fig. 3, gives
χ2/DOF ∼ 1 under the condition RT > rres, and thus regarded as a favored interaction by the
data.
Contrary to our conclusion, the STAR collaboration obtained a diﬀerent result; a0 = 1.10 ±
0.37+0.08
−0.68 fm [30]. This positive scattering length suggests that there is a bound state of ΛΛ or
the ΛΛ interaction is repulsive, neither of which are not immediately acceptable, then we now
discuss the reason of the diﬀerence. One of the diﬀerences in the two analyses is the assumption
on the pair purity probability λ. We have evaluated λ based on the measurements of Σ0 and Ξ0
(ﬁxed λ case), while the STAR collaboration takes λ as a free parameter (free λ case). Another
diﬀerence is the correlation function formula; we have used the KP formula Eq. (1) with and
without the ﬂow eﬀects, while the STAR collaboration has used the LL model, Eq. (15). We need
explicit potentials to evaluate the wave function in the KP formula. Most of the ΛΛ potentials
examined in Ref. [31] do not predict the existence of the ΛΛ bound state. Exceptions are the
Nijmegen hard core models [33], where the hard core radius is not given for ΛΛ and there exists
a bound state with a small hard core radius. Thus the positive a0 region is not well explored in
Ref. [31].

In order to pin down which is essential, we re-analyze the data by using the LL model with
diﬀerent assumptions on λ. In the upper panel of Fig. 2, we compare the results the ΛΛ cor-
relation in the LL model Eq. (16) (dashed line) with those in the KP formula Eq. (1) with
the fss2 interaction. In the LL model, we take the low energy scattering parameters of fss2,
(a0, reﬀ) = (−0.81 fm, 3.99 fm), and calculate the phase shift from these values. We ﬁnd that
the LL model reproduces the correlation in the original formula, suggesting that results from the
asymptotic wave function corrected with the eﬀective range give a good estimate.

In the lower panel of Fig. 2, we show the LL model results of the correlation function in
the free and ﬁxed λ cases, where the best ﬁt parameters are found to be (a0, reﬀ, R, χ2/DOF) =
(1.0 fm, 9 fm, 2.9 fm, 0.53) and (−0.83 fm, 3 fm, 1.5 fm, 0.61), respectively. Here we have also

9

introduced a global normalization factor factor ∼ 1.006 in Eq. (18). It is interesting to ﬁnd that
the correlation function in the free λ case explains also the wiggling behavior of the data. In the
ﬁxed λ case, the correlation function overestimates the data at small q, which may be improved
when we take account of the ﬂow eﬀects.

The solid (dashed) contour in Fig. 3 shows the favored region boundary χ2/DOF = 0.56
(0.65) in the free (ﬁxed) λ case. We have conﬁrmed that positive a0 values are favored in the
free λ case and the optimal value is found to be λ ≃ 0.18, which is consistent with the STAR
collaboration result. Quantum statistics and the pair purity give C(q → 0) = 1 − λ/2 ∼ 0.91 at
λ = 0.18, while the data show C(q → 0) ≃ 0.82. Thus we need to suppress C(q) at small q by the
ΛΛ interaction and positive a0 is favored. By contrast, for a ﬁxed λ = (0.67)2, the corresponding
HBT correlation CΛΛ(q → 0) = 1 − λ/2 ≃ 0.78 is slightly smaller than the observed correlation.
With the residual source contribution, ares ∼ −0.05, the diﬀerence from the data becomes more
evident. The ΛΛ interaction needs to enhance the correlation, and the optimal a0 value is found
in the negative region, as concluded in Ref. [31].

4. K− p Correlation

The ¯KN interaction is the key to understand the structure of the Λ(1405) and the properties of
¯K in nuclear medium. There have been a long-standing problem of the inconsistency between the
K− p scattering data and the kaonic hydrogen measurement. The problem has eventually been
resolved by the new result of the kaonic hydrogen from the SIDDHARTA collaboration [19].
Thanks to the precise measurement by SIDDHARTA, quantitative understanding of whole ex-
perimental database is now achieved by the coupled-channel approach with chiral SU(3) dynam-
ics at the level of χ2/DOF ∼ 1 [20, 21]. To predict the correlation function, we need the K− p
wave function ψK− p(r), which can be calculated by the equivalent local potential as developed in
Ref. [44]. The most reliable ¯KN potential at present is constructed in Ref. [42], using the scatter-
ing amplitude of Refs. [20, 21]. By construction, this ¯KN potential reproduces the experimental
data with the accuracy of χ2/DOF ∼ 1.

The source size is set to be R = 3 fm.

In Fig. 4, we show the K− p correlation function obtained by the ¯KN potential in Ref. [42].
The source size is set to be R = 3.0 fm. The interaction range of the original potential is about 0.4
fm [42]. To examine the potential range dependence, we prepare diﬀerent potentials by changing
the range parameter but keeping the amplitude unchanged. We ﬁnd that the correlation function
does not change very much when we vary the range parameter from 0.2 fm to 0.8 fm. Because
there is no π exchange in the K− p system, we conclude that the short range details of the K− p
interaction does not aﬀect the correlation function for the source size R = 3.0 fm. Thus the
correlation function is dominated by the long range part of the wave function, and the correlation
function is well reproduced by the LL model (17), as shown by the dashed line in Fig. 4. We note
that the Coulomb interaction is not included in the present result. The inclusion of the Coulomb
interaction will modify the correlation function at small q. In the actual measurement, there is the
Λ(1520) resonance in d-wave K− p scattering, which may aﬀect the correlation around q ∼ 0.24
GeV/c.
It is also interesting to note the bump structure around q ∼ 0.05 GeV/c. There is no bump
structure in the K− p amplitude at the corresponding energy. It turns out that this bump structure
arises from the detailed interference between two phases of I = 0 and I = 1 components in ˜S K− p
deﬁned in Eq. (11). In this way, the K− p correlation function gives a complementary information
with the elastic K− p scattering.

5. Summary

We have analyzed the ΛΛ and K− p intensity correlation in high-energy heavy-ion collisions,

which will provide information of the ΛΛ and K− p interactions.

We have investigated the dependence of the ΛΛ correlation on the ΛΛ interaction and the pair
purity parameter λ. Recent two analyses of the ΛΛ correlation data [30, 31] give diﬀerent signs
of the scattering length for the favored ΛΛ interaction. This diﬀerence is found to come from
the assumption on the pair purity parameter λ. When λ is chosen to minimize the χ2, the optimal
value of λ is found to be small, λ ≃ 0.18. The corresponding Hanbury Brown, Twiss (HBT)
correlation is larger than the observed value, CΛΛ(q → 0) ≃ 0.82, then the ΛΛ interactions with
positive a0 (decreasing phase shift at low energy) are favored in order to suppress the correlation.
With λ = (0.67)2 evaluated on the basis of the measured data of the Σ0/Λ [40, 41], the corre-
sponding HBT correlation is smaller than the observed correlation. Thus the ΛΛ interactions
with negative a0 (increasing phase shift) are favored to enhance the correlation. Experimental
conﬁrmation of Σ0 yield in heavy-ion collisions is important.

We also discuss the K− p correlation function in heavy-ion collisions. We use the K− p poten-
tial developed in Ref. [42] which is ﬁtted to the scattering amplitude including the SIDDHARTA
data [20, 21]. We ﬁnd that the K− p correlation function does not depend on the short range
details of the potential very much, for the source size of R ∼ 3 fm. Because of the coupled-
channel nature of the problem, the K− p correlation function reﬂects a particular combination of
the isospin components which is diﬀerent from the K− p elastic scattering. This is a unique fea-
ture of correlation functions in coupled channel systems. As a consequence, the detailed study
of the K− p correlation function is considered as complementary to the K− p scattering.

There are more works to be done as an extension of this work. As for the ΛΛ interaction,
comparison with data obtained at the KEKB e+e− collider [4] as well as data to be obtained at
the Large Hadron Collider at CERN [6] and J-PARC [46] should be helpful to constrain ΛΛ
interaction more precisely. Understanding the origin of the “residual” source is a theoretical
challenge. As for the K− p correlation, the Coulomb interaction has to be seriously considered,

11

since it will modify the correlation at small q. Application to other channels such as Ω− p [47] is
also interesting.
