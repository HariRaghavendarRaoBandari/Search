BLOW-UP PHENOMENA FOR GRADIENT FLOWS OF DISCRETE

HOMOGENEOUS FUNCTIONALS

VINCENT CALVEZ AND THOMAS GALLOU¨ET

Abstract. We investigate gradient ﬂows of some homogeneous functionals in RN , aris-
ing in the Lagrangian approximation of systems of self-interacting and diﬀusing particles.
We focus on the case of negative homogeneity. In the case of strong self-interaction, the
functional possesses a cone of negative energy. It is immediate to see that solutions with
negative energy at some time become singular in ﬁnite time, meaning that a subset of
particles concentrate at a single point. Here, we establish that all solutions become singu-
lar in ﬁnite time for the class of functionals under consideration. The paper is completed
with numerical simulations illustrating the striking non linear dynamics when initial data
have positive energy.

1. Introduction and main result

We investigate a deterministic particle approximation of the gradient ﬂow of homoge-

neous functionals in the family

where χ > 0 is the interaction coeﬃcient, and m ∈ (1, 2) is the non linear diﬀusion
exponent. Here, ρ is a probability distribution function such that ρ ∈ Lm ∩ L1(|x|2dx).

Such functionals arise as free energy functionals for models of self-interacting, diﬀusing
particles [15, 16], for instance the Keller-Segel model and its non-linear variants (see [4, 8,
13, 2] and references therein). The approach we follow in this paper is currently restricted
to the one-dimensional case.

The condition m > 1 expresses that the functional has negative homogeneity in a
particular sense (see below), whereas the condition m < 2 guarantees integrability of the
interaction kernel. The latter condition will disappear as soon as we switch to a discrete
problem.

Homogeneity of (1.1) under mass-preserving dilations reads as follows,

Gm[ρλ] = λ1−mGm[ρ] , where ρλ(x) = λ−1ρ(λ−1x) .

After the usual Lagrangian transformation ρ (cid:55)→ X, where X : (0, 1) → R denotes the
pseudo-inverse of the cumulative distribution function associated with ρ [19, 12, 6], the
functional (1.1) reads equivalently,
|X(p) − X(q)|1−m dpdq .
(1.2) Fm(X) =
Intuitively, X encodes the position of particles with respect to the partial mass p ∈ (0, 1).
Homogeneity of (1.2) reads as usual, Fm(λX) = λ1−mFm(X).

Consider the gradient ﬂow of Gm, resp. Fm in the Wasserstein metric space, resp. the
L2 Hilbert space (see [17, 20, 1] for precise concepts and deﬁnitions), which is written in
the abstract way as follows,

˙X(t) = −∇Fm(X(t)) .

Then, it is an immediate consequence of homogeneity that

|X(t)|2

= X(t) ·

˙X(t) = −X(t) · ∇Fm(X(t)) = (m − 1)Fm(X(t)) .

Moreover, we deduce from the gradient ﬂow structure that,

Fm(X(t)) = −(m − 1)|∇Fm(X(t))|2 .

(1.4)
Therefore, |X|2 is concave along any trajectory. If it is decreasing at some time, then it
must vanishes in ﬁnite time. The latter condition is equivalent to the existence of t0 such
that Fm(X(t0)) < 0. We refer to [4] for a similar result in the Keller-Segel problem with
non linear diﬀusion.
The following question arises naturally: does there exist t0 such that Fm(X(t0)) < 0 for
any initial data? Alternatively speaking, do solutions always blow-up? A ﬁrst condition is
clearly that the energy functional Fm possesses a cone of negative energy. In the class of
functionals (1.2), this requires χ to be large enough, namely χ > χm, for some threshold
value χm [4].
The purpose of this work is to answer positively this question, but for a ﬁnite dimensional
approximation of (1.2), which complies with the same algebra as Fm. More precisely, it
is required that similar identities as (1.3) and (1.4) hold for the approximate system.

Let m > 1. The discrete energy functional we study here is deduced from a ﬁnite
diﬀerence approximation of X(p) on a regular grid. Let (Xi)1≤i≤N be the positions of N
ordered particles sharing equal mass 1/N , such that X1 < X2 < ··· < XN . The discrete
functional is deﬁned by analogy with (1.2):

where we have renormalized χ in order to absorb prefactors involving the fraction of mass

Remark 1.1. For the sake of comparison, we recall that the limiting case m → 1 was
studied in [3, 7]. In this case, the functional reads as follows,

Deﬁnition 1.2. For the discrete problem (1.7)–(1.8) we refer to the subcritical regime
when χ < CN , and to the super critical regime when χ > CN . The critical case refers to
χ = CN .

The next couple of Theorems give an almost complete description of possible dynamics

of (1.7)–(1.8).

Firstly, global existence holds in the subcritical regime.

Theorem 1.3 (Subcritical regime). Let m > 1, and χ < CN . Let X0 ∈ RN , and let X
be the solution of the system (1.7)–(1.8) with initial data X(0) = X0. Then, the maximal
time of existence of X is T = +∞.
Theorem 1.4 (Super critical regime). Let m > 1, and χ > CN . Let X0 ∈ RN , and let
X be the solution of the system (1.7)–(1.8) with initial data X(0) = X0. Then, up to a
ﬁnite range of values for χ, the maximal time of existence is ﬁnite, T < +∞, without any
condition on X0. More precisely,

(1) If χ /∈ (Cp)p=1...N−1, then X blows up in ﬁnite time.
(2) If there exists an integer p ∈ [1, N − 1] such that χ = Cp, then either X blows
up in ﬁnite time or the renormalized location Y = X|X| blows up in inﬁnite time.
Moreover, any relative blow-up set of Y obtained after extraction of a subsequence
Y (tn), contains exactly p particles. In the latter case, the restriction of Y (tn) to
the blow-up set converges after subsequent renormalization to the unique critical
point of F p
m.

The deﬁnition of a relative blow up set is given in Deﬁnition 4.1. Loosely speaking, it
consists in the set of particles participating in the core of the blow-up, up to extraction.
Our last result deals with the critical case χ = CN .
Theorem 1.5 (Critical case). Let m > 1, and χ > CN . Let X0 ∈ RN , and let X be the
solution of the system (1.7)–(1.8) with initial data X(0) = X0. Then, the maximal time
of existence of X is T = +∞. Moreover, if |X(t)| is uniformly bounded, then Y = X|X|
converges to the unique critical point of Fm with unit norm.

This is somehow unsatisfactory to distinguish between the case χ = Cp for some p, and
χ (cid:54)= Cp. However, we believe that there are strong diﬀerences in the dynamics that rule
out a uniﬁed result for all χ > CN . We already encountered such restrictions in the reﬁned
description of blow-up sets in the logarithmic case m = 1 [7].

Figure 1. Comparison of typical blow-up dynamics for a discrete gradient
ﬂow with 50 particles. Left panel corresponds to the case of logarithmic
homogeneity (1.6), and Right panel corresponds to homogeneity 1 − m,
with m > 1 (1.5) (m = 1.2 here). Top ﬁgures are in original scales. We see
that a subset of particles concentrate at the origin in ﬁnite time. Dynam-
ics seem quite diﬀerent in both cases. Bottom ﬁgures are obtained after
a proper parabolic rescaling (see [7] for details about this procedure. Par-
ticles outside the blow-up set are sent to inﬁnity, whereas particles inside
the blow-up set are distributed asymptotically along some proﬁle which is
presumably the proﬁle of some renormalized functional energy. We do not
address this last issue in the present work, but we focus on the uncondi-
tional blow-up in the super-critical regime. See Section 6 for more details
about the numerical procedure.

Our approach cannot readily be extended to the inﬁnite-dimensional case of (1.2). In-
deed, we crucially use discrete functional inequalities that we are not able to establish in
the continuous setting.

We certainly miss some complicated dynamics speciﬁc to the continuous setting. On
the other hand, our analysis does not rely on any perturbation argument but mostly
rely on homogeneity. Finally, we emphasize that we are able to recover a very nice di-
chotomy, analogous to the two-dimensional Keller-Segel model, or the one-dimensional
Keller-Segel equation with a logarithmic interaction kernel [8, 3], for which the present
ﬁnite-dimensional reduction yields (1.6).

However, the case m = 1 is much simpler, because the logarithmic homogeneity F1(λX) =

F1(X) + (N − 1)(−1 + χN/2) immediately implies the following relation,

(cid:18) 1

(cid:19)

|X(t)|2

= (N − 1)(1 − χN/2) .

Therefore, blow-up necessarily occurs in ﬁnite time when χ > 2/N . Alternative arguments
show that global existence holds when χ < 2/N . It is remarkable that Theorems 1.3 and
1.4 can reproduce such a dichotomy although the dynamics are much more nonlinear
(the second moment is not monotonic, for instance). For the sake of comparison, typical
blow-up dynamics are plotted in Figure 1.

To conclude this introduction, we put our results in a more general context. As men-
tioned above, similar results were obtained for the high-dimensional Keller-Segel system
(d ≥ 3) with nonlinear diﬀusion by Sugiyama [18] and Blanchet, Carrillo and Lauren¸cot
[4],

With this speciﬁc choice of exponents, both contributions in the functional have the same
homogeneity under mass-preserving dilations, ρλ(x) = λ−dρ(λ−1x). The Wasserstein met-
ric confers a gradient ﬂow structure to the system [17, 1]. The authors proved that initial
data with negative energy yields blow-up in ﬁnite time [4, Lemma 4.1]. However, they
leave the case of positive energy open.

More recently, on the same problem (1.10), Yao used comparison principles valid under
radially symmetric conditions, in order to prove blow-up for a large class of initial data,
including the ones having positive energy [21]. Note that she crucially used the fact that
the interaction kernel is the Green’s function of the d−dimensional laplacian, in order to
reduce the problem to a local equation on cumulative mass inside balls.

This section uses homogeneity and optimal transports arguments. Section 4 is devoted to
the proof of Theorem 1.4 and is speciﬁc to the particle system, in particular throughout
compactness arguments. In Section 5 we investigate the (sub)-critical case, prove Theorem
1.5, Theorem 1.3 and discuss the perspectives of our work. Finally we complete our analysis
with numerical results in Section 6.

Theorem 3.1. Let χ > 0, and p ∈ N∗. If α ≥ 0, then any critical point of F p
m,α is a
minimizer of F p
m in Rp, up to dilation.
In addition, when χ = Cp, there exists a unique minimizer of F p
Remark 3.2. The proof of Theorem 3.1 is inspired by optimal transport techniques: we
transport any conﬁguration to some critical point, then we use a convexity inequality to
conclude. Similar ideas can be found in [3][Proposition 4.4] and [5].
Proof of Theorem 3.1. First, we notice that, for χ = Cp, minimizers of F p
maximal functions in Proposition 2.3. This proves existence of minimizers in this case.
In order to prove that critical points are minimizers, we begin with a characterization of
critical points. Recall that, by convention, we set |Xp+1 − Xp|1−m = |X1 − X0|1−m = 0.

We divide the rest of the proof in two cases, resp. α = 0, and α > 0.

Case 1: α = 0. For sake of clarity, we begin with the case α = 0 which simply reduces
to Jensen’s inequality. The strategy is to make appear, for each contribution in F p

4. Blow-up phenomena

We begin with some useful deﬁnitions and computations inspired by the case with
logarithmic homogeneity [7]. Let I = [l, r] ⊂ [1, N ] be some set of consecutive indices. We
deﬁne J = [l, r − 1], ∂J = ({l − 1} ∪ {r}) ∩ [1, N − 1], O = [1, N ] \ I and E = [1, N ] \ J .
Observe that ∂J ⊂ E.
Deﬁnition 4.1 (Relative blow-up set). We say that I is a relative blow-up set for a
sequence (X n) if

The ﬁrst condition states that particles in I are collapsing. The second condition states
that nothing collapse faster than particles in I. As a direct consequence, particles in I
collapse at the same rate (take k ∈ J ). The third condition states that I is maximal for
the rate of collapse.
In summary, a relative blow-up set is a connected set having the fastest possible dynam-
ics when blow up occurs. The notation J refers to the gaps between consecutive particles
in I, whereas ∂J refers to the gaps between I and its nearest neighbours on each side.

Deﬁnition 4.2. Let T ∈ (0, +∞] and X ∈ C0(cid:0)[0, T ),RN(cid:1) be a solution of the system

(1.7)–(1.8). We say that X blows up if there exists some index i0, and some sequence
tn → T , such that lim (Xi0+1(tn) − Xi0(tn)) = 0. Then, it is always possible to build a
relative blow-up set for (X(tn)) after further extraction.

For a relative blow up set we can deﬁne a limiting proﬁle.

Proposition 4.3. Let I be a relative blow up set, associated with the sequence (X n). Let
p = |I| and ΠI(X n) =

VINCENT CALVEZ AND THOMAS GALLOU¨ET

The next proposition concerns the occurrence of blow-up in the super-critical regime,
when the energy is negative initially. This is the easiest part, as explained in the Intro-
duction.
Proposition 4.4 (Blow-up with initial negative energy). Let χ > CN and X0 ∈ RN such
that F N
m (X0) < 0. Then, the solution X(t) of the gradient ﬂow system (1.7)–(1.8) blows
up in ﬁnite time.

Proof. Notice that we have

d
dt

m (X(t))(cid:1) = −(cid:12)(cid:12)∇F N
(cid:0)F N

m (X(t))(cid:12)(cid:12)2

.

Therefore (∀t ≥ 0) F N
2|X(t)|2. It is a consequence of homogeneity (see Proposition 2.2) that

m (X(t)) ≤ F N

m (X0). We compute the second moment f2(t) =

1

(t) = X(t) · ∇X(t) = −X(t) · ∇F N

m (X(t)) = (m − 1)F N

m (X(t)) ≤ (m − 1)F N

m (X0) .

Therefore, since it is assumed that F N

m (X0) < 0, the second moment decreases at least
(cid:3)

To handle the case where the initial condition has positive energy, the most natural
quantity to compute is some power function of the second moment. The next proposition
contains the material of this computation.
Proposition 4.5. Let χ > 0 and X0 ∈ RN . Let X(t) be the solution of the gradient ﬂow
system (1.7)–(1.8). We deﬁne

(3) If there exists some p ∈ [1, N − 1] with χ = Cp then δNH = 0. There is no minimizer
due to lack of compactness. There exists a relative blow up set up to extracting a
subsequence. Moreover, all such relative blow up sets are made of p consecutive
particles converging towards a critical point of F p

Proof. Suppose that δNH = 0. Let (Y n) be a minimizing sequence such that HN
m+1(Y n) → 0.
By compactness, we can extract a subsequence converging to some Y ∞ ∈ RN . We denote
by q the number of distinct values taken by the limiting proﬁle Y ∞. We denote by
(Y l)1≤l≤q the ordered distinct values in the limit, Y 1 < Y 2 < ··· < Y q. See Figure 2 for
the notations.

and we deﬁne Iu accordingly. The sets Iu are two by two disjoint, and each Iu belongs to
some part Bl. Moreover, each Iu, made of consecutive indices, is a relative blow-up set.
See Figure 2 for the notations. We denote pu = |Iu|. It is remarkable that we will prove
eventually that all pu are equals.

then γj,i < +∞ implies that γi,j > 0. On the other hand, if j /∈ (cid:98)J , then there exists

Remark 4.8. To obtain some rigidity results about the structure of the blow-up set, as
in [7], it is necessary to understand the next order term in (4.22).

We are now in position to prove our ﬁrst main theorem.

Proof of Theorem 1.4. (1) Assume by contradiction that blow-up does not occur. This
implies that fm+1(t) ≥ 0 for all t, otherwise blow-up necessary occurs in ﬁnite time. We
ﬁrst establish that the second moment is uniformly bounded. According to (4.4) and
Lemma 4.7, if there exists no p ∈ [1, N − 1] such that χ = Cp, then there exists δ > 0 such
that

(4.23)

d2fm+1

(t) ≤ −δ (fm+1 (t))

−1 .

Multiplying this diﬀerential inequality by dfm+1
we deduce

(t) ≥ 0 (4.3), and integrating over (0, t),

+ δ ln (fm+1 (t)) ≤ C0 ,

where the constant C0 depends on the initial data. It implies that fm+1 (t) is uniformly
bounded by exp(C0/δ). In particular, back to (4.23) we realize that the function fm+1 is
δ concave, for some δ > 0. Consequently, fm+1 cannot remain nonnegative for all time.
This is a contradiction.
(2) If there exists p ∈ [1, N − 1] such that χ = Cp, Lemma 4.7 provides us with the
following alternative: either H is uniformly bounded below along the trajectory, hence
blow-up occurs in ﬁnite time; or the renormalized locations Y = X|X| blow up in inﬁnite

18

time and there exists a relative blow up set containing p particles and converging towards
the critical point of F p

m on the unit sphere, up to extraction of some subsequence.

5. Dichotomy and discussion

To complete the results of this paper, we establish that the minimal number of particles
taking part in each blow-up set is at least k + 1, where k is deﬁned such as χ < Ck. As a
consequence, the solution exists for all time in the subcritical regime. In the super critical
regime, the next step of investigation would be to describe in a reﬁned way the blow up
mechanism in the spirit of [7]. For instance, one may ask what is the mass contained in
the ﬁrst singularity, or whether the energy must become negative before the occurrence of
blow up. A ﬁrst step towards these issue is given by the following propositions. The reﬁned
description of blow-up, similar to [7], is left for future work. Also left for future work is the
asymptotics of renormalized solutions in the subcritical regime. In the logarithmic case, it
was proven in [3] that solutions converge exponentially fast to a unique equilibrium state
after suitable parabolic rescaling (see [6, 9] for a similar result in the continuous case).
However, the argument of [3] cannot be readily extended to the present case because the
nonzero homogeneity creates some additional terms that cannot be handled easily (see [5]
for similar issues in the continuous setting).

Deﬁnition 5.1 (Blow-up of particles). Let T ∈ [0, +∞) and X ∈ C0(cid:0)[0, T ),RN(cid:1). Let

Iw = [l, r] ⊂ [1, N ] be a set of consecutive indices, Ow = [1, N ] \ I, Jw = [l, r − 1] and
∂Jw = ({l − 1} ∪ {r}) ∩ [1, N − 1]. We say that I weakly blows up at time T if

(5.1)

∀i ∈ Jw

lim inf

t→T − (Xi+1 − Xi) = 0.

when the set I is maximal for the inclusion, we refer to it as a weak blow-up set.

Remark 5.2. For a solution X of the the discrete gradient ﬂow (1.7)–(1.8), either X
exists for all time or there exists a weak blow-up set for X.

Proposition 5.3. . Let X be a solution of the the discrete gradient ﬂow (1.7)–(1.8) and
χ < Ck. Any ﬁnite time weak blow up set contains at least k + 1 particles.

A proof of an analogous result in the case of logarithmic homogeneity can be found
in [7]. The strategy there was to localize the energy on speciﬁc subsets of particles, and
deduce fruitful estimates.
Proof. We consider a weak blow-up set Iw made of p ≤ k particles. Since Iw is a weak
blow-up set, by maximality, we have

(cid:18)

min
j∈∂Jw

Therefore there exists c > 0 such that for any j ∈ Ow, i ∈ Iw and s ∈ [0, T ),

(cid:3)

In the subcritical case this proposition proves Theorem 1.3. In the super critical case
it proves that a weak blow up set contains at least the critical number of particles. Using
similar computations as done in the proof of Lemma 4.7, one can obtained the following
proposition.

Proposition 5.4. Let χ < Ck and X be a solution of the the discrete gradient ﬂow (1.7)–
(1.8) which blows up in ﬁnite time, then at least one relative blow up set has a nonpositive
local energy and contains more than k + 1 particles.
Proof. Let Y n be a subsequence of X|X| . Following the proof of Lemma 4.7 we can extract
a subsequence and use equation (4.19) that is:

To go further one need to prove for example an Harnack inequality for the weak blow
up set, in the spirit of [7]. This question is left to a futur work, together with the study
of the convergence towards equilibrium.

6. Numerics

We present numerical simulations of the gradient ﬂow system (1.7)-(1.8) which are
driven by, and illustrate, previous analysis. Our main message is that dynamics for m > 1
are more nonlinear than the logarithmic case m = 1. In particular, the evolution of the
second momentum |X(t)|2 is linear in the latter case, whereas it is genuinely concave in
the case m > 1.

In this section, we set m = 1.2, N = 200, and χ = 1.45 which is slightly above the

critical value χm(N ).

6.1. Methodology. We used an Euler implicite scheme wich involves Newton’s algorithm
at each time step to compute X(tn+1) from X(tn). This is equivalent to a steepest-descent
scheme, also known as the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto scheme in our context [14, 12, 3].
The initial state is a regular discretization of X0(p) = 4 ∗ tanh (10 ∗ (p − 0.5)) (see Fig.
3(left)).
It corresponds to an initial density which is equally concentrated around two
peaks (see Fig. 3(right)). The two peaks are chosen suﬃciently far apart, so that the
initial energy is positive, F(X0) > 0.

In order to obtain better accuracy in some interesting time ranges, we used a non

uniform time step (details given below).

6.2. Results. Firstly, we conﬁrm that the second moment is genuinely concave (1.4), see
Fig. 4. Moreover, it changes monotonicity after some time t0 ≈ 4, in accordance with
analysis developped in Section 4. Consequently, the solution blows-up in ﬁnite time.
Nonlinear eﬀects are more visible on the evolution of the energy functional along the
trajectory F(X(t)). We distinguish between three phases.
In a ﬁrst stage, the energy
decays rapidly from an initial positive value, to negative values. This corresponds to rapid
smoothing and rearrangement of the initial density (Fig. 3(right)). During this ﬁrst phase,
the second moment grows, indicating a global spreading of particles (Fig. 3(right)). In
a second stage, the second moment decays almost linearly (Fig. 4), indicating the global
shrinkage of the cloud of particles. However, this happens at an approximately constant
energy level (Fig. 5). After a relatively long phase of rearrangement at constant energy,
the energy suddenly drops down, indicating aggregation of a subset of particles into a
blow-up set.

As mentioned above, time steps were not chosen uniformly. More precisely, ∆t = 5.10−2
up to t0 = 4, corresponding to the initial phase of growth of the second moment, and
dramatic decrease of the energy. Then, time step was increased to ∆t = 5.10−1, during
the long phase of rearrangement at almost constant energy, up to the time where the
Newton’s algorithm did not converge to a solution of the implicit Euler scheme (here,
t1 = 249.75). Lastly, the time step was decreased in an adaptive manneer in order to
continue iterations as close as possible to the blow-up time.
