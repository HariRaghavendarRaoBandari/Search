ABSTRACT

We present measurements of the [N II]/Hα ratio as a probe of gas-phase oxygen abundance for a
sample of 419 star-forming galaxies at z = 0.6 − 2.7 from the KMOS3D near-IR multi-IFU survey. The
mass-metallicity relation (MZR) is determined consistently with the same sample selection, metallicity
tracer, and methodology over the wide redshift range probed by the survey. We ﬁnd good agreement
with long-slit surveys in the literature, except for the low-mass slope of the relation at z ∼ 2.3, where
this sample is less biased than previous samples based on optical spectroscopic redshifts. In this regime
we measure a steeper slope than some literature results. Excluding the AGN contribution from the
MZR reduces sensitivity at the high mass end, but produces otherwise consistent results. There is
no signiﬁcant dependence of the [N II]/Hα ratio on SFR or environment at ﬁxed redshift and stellar
mass. The IFU data allow spatially resolved measurements of [N II]/Hα, from which we can infer
abundance gradients for 180 galaxies, thus tripling the current sample in the literature. The observed
gradients are on average ﬂat, with only 15 gradients statistically oﬀset from zero at > 3σ. We have
modelled the eﬀect of beam-smearing, assuming a smooth intrinsic radial gradient and known seeing,
inclination and eﬀective radius for each galaxy. Our seeing-limited observations can recover up to
70% of the intrinsic gradient for the largest, face-on disks, but only 30% for the smaller, more inclined
galaxies. We do not ﬁnd signiﬁcant trends between observed or corrected gradients and any stellar
population, dynamical or structural galaxy parameters, mostly in agreement with existing studies
with much smaller sample sizes. In cosmological simulations, strong feedback is generally required to
produce ﬂat gradients at high redshift.

1. INTRODUCTION

The evolution of the cosmic star formation density and
the mass growth of galaxies is largely driven by their
available gas reservoirs, as determined from the inter-
play between gas accretion through cosmic inﬂow and
mergers, star formation, and gas outﬂows driven by AGN
and stellar feedback (e.g. Genel et al. 2008; Dekel et
al. 2009; Bouch´e et al. 2010; Dav´e et al. 2012; Lilly et

* Based on observations obtained at the Very Large Telescope
(VLT) of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), Paranal,
Chile (ESO program IDs 092.A-0091, 093.A-0079, 094.A-0217, and
095.A-0047). This work is further based on observations taken by
the 3D-HST Treasury Program (GO 12177 and 12328) with the
NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the As-
sociation of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under
NASA contract NAS5-26555.

al. 2013; Tacconi et al. 2013). The same processes also
determine the metal content of galaxies, its spatial dis-
tribution and its evolution over cosmic time. Observa-
tionally, we ﬁnd a tight correlation between stellar mass
and gas-phase oxygen abundance in the local Universe,
as robustly quantiﬁed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS Tremonti et al. 2004). Theoretical models ex-
plain this relation through a combination of momentum-
or energy-driven winds to remove metal-rich gas from
the galaxy, inﬂows of metal-poor gas from the surround-
ing intergalactic medium, and variations in the star for-
mation eﬃciency of galaxies (e.g. Dalcanton et al. 2004;
Brooks et al. 2007; Finlator & Dav´e 2008; Spitoni et al.
2010; Peeples et al. 2011; Lu et al. 2015). Observational
constraints on the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and
its evolution over cosmic time thus provide useful bench-
marks for semi-analytic and numerical galaxy evolution
models addressing the relative importance of gas inﬂow,
enrichment, recycling and outﬂow.

Towards higher redshift, an overall decrease in metal-
licity at ﬁxed stellar mass has been well established with
large samples since the recent developments of multi-
object spectrographs and the availability of grism data
from the Hubble Space Telescope (e.g. Erb et al. 2006;
Zahid et al. 2011; Henry et al. 2013; Stott et al. 2013;
Cullen et al. 2014; Steidel et al. 2014; Wuyts, E. et al.
2014; Zahid et al. 2014; Sanders et al. 2015).
In ab-
solute terms, the normalisation of the MZR evolution

2

remains uncertain due to its dependence on the metal-
licity indicator used (Kewley & Ellison 2008). Since the
set of observable rest-frame optical emission lines shifts
with redshift, studies targeting diﬀerent redshift ranges
typically use diﬀerent strong-line indicators, which com-
plicates a direct comparison. Additionally, it remains
unclear whether for the same indicator, the locally de-
rived calibration remains valid at higher redshift given
the diﬀerent photo-ionisation conditions of high-z galax-
ies (e.g. Kewley et al. 2013; Steidel et al. 2014; Shapley
et al. 2015). New approaches using Bayesian analysis
or χ2 minimisation for a larger set of emission lines to
jointly solve for the galaxy metallicity as well as inter-
stellar medium (ISM) properties such as ionisation pa-
rameter and electron density, are attempting to address
this (P´erez-Montero 2014; Blanc et al. 2015).

In addition to the total metal content of galaxies, the
spatial distribution of heavy elements within galaxies fur-
ther constrains their baryonic and chemical assembly his-
tory. In the local Universe, abundance measurements of
individual H II regions generally ﬁnd that galaxies have
negative gradients, where the inner regions have higher
metallicities than the outer disk regions, indicative of an
inside-out growth scenario (Zaritsky et al. 1994; van Zee
et al. 1998; S´anchez et al. 2014). There are indications
of a ﬂattening of the gradient outside the isophotal ra-
dius, possibly due to lower star formation eﬃciency in the
outer disk (e.g. Goddard et al. 2011; Bresolin et al. 2012).
Mergers have been found to exhibit ﬂat gradients, likely
due to interaction-induced inﬂow of metal-poor gas in
the centre and metal mixing (Kewley et al. 2010; Rupke
et al. 2010a,b; Perez et al. 2011; S´anchez et al. 2014).
At high redshift, dilution from gas infall into the galaxy
centre has been invoked to explain some observations of
positive abundance gradients (Cresci et al. 2010).

The time evolution of abundance gradients can be pre-
dicted from classical analytical models of the chemical
evolution of the Milky Way disk (Chiappini et al. 2001;
Moll´a & D´ıaz 2005; Fu et al. 2009), or from cosmologi-
cal hydrodynamical simulations (Kobayashi & Nakasato
2011; Rahimi et al. 2011; Few et al. 2012; Pilkington et
al. 2012; Gibson et al. 2013; Angl´es-Alc´azar et al. 2014).
Pilkington et al. (2012) ﬁnd little agreement in an ex-
tensive comparison of diﬀerent simulations and chemical
evolution models, which they trace back to the varying
treatment of star formation and feedback in the simu-
lations. The impact of the assumed feedback scenario
is examined further by Gibson et al. (2013).
In this
study, “normal” feedback (using 10-40% of SN energy
to heat the surrounding ISM) predicts steep gradients
of -0.3 dex/kpc at z ∼ 2 which ﬂatten over time, while
“enhanced” feedback (including radiation pressure from
massive stars) can better redistribute metal-enriched gas
over large spatial scales and produces relatively ﬂat gra-
dients at all times. These studies highlight how robust
gradient measurements at high redshift can provide pow-
erful constraints on the uncertain nature of stellar feed-
back processes.

Unfortunately also the observational measurements
present challenges, requiring signiﬁcant time investments
to spatially resolve the fainter emission lines (typically
[N II] and/or Hβ) used in the strong-line metallicity cal-
ibrations. The current sample available in the literature

consists of 90 gradients at z = 0.8 − 3.8. Adaptive-optics
(AO) assisted SINFONI observations have resulted in
measured gradients for nine Hα-selected HiZELS galax-
ies at z = 0.8 − 2.24 (Swinbank et al. 2012) and 19
SINS/zCSINF galaxies at z = 1.4−2.4 (F¨orster Schreiber
et al. 2016, in prep.). Without AO, there are 26 gradi-
ents at z ∼ 1.2 from MASSIV (Queyrel et al. 2012) and
10 gradients at z ∼ 3 − 4 from AMAZE (Troncoso et
al. 2014). Taking advantage of the multiplexing capabil-
ities of KMOS at the VLT, Stott et al. (2014) present
a ﬁrst sample of 20 gradients at z ∼ 0.8 from HiZELS.
There are concerns whether the coarse spatial resolution
of seeing-limited observations, typically 5 kpc at z ∼ 2,
can recover the intrinsic gradient (Yuan et al. 2013). AO-
assisted or space-based observations of lensed galaxies
can reach spatial resolutions down to 200-300 pc in the
source plane. For 16 lensed galaxies with OSIRIS+AO
data (Jones et al. 2010; Yuan et al. 2011; Jones et al.
2013; Leethochawalit et al. 2015) and one arc with HST
grism data from the Grism Lens-Ampliﬁed Survey from
Space (GLASS, Jones et al. 2015), some steeper gradi-
ents have been recovered, but most measurements are
comparable to non-lensed samples at similar redshift.

In this work, we exploit the large redshift coverage of
the KMOS3D survey from z = 2.7 to z = 0.6 for a consis-
tent study of the evolution of the MZR over ﬁve billion
years around the period of peak star formation activity in
the Universe. We use the spatially resolved information
unique to our integral ﬁeld spectroscopic survey to mea-
sure abundance gradients for 180 galaxies, thus tripling
the total sample. The Paper is organised as follows. §2
summarises the KMOS3D sample selection, observations,
and data reduction. The mass-metallicity relation and
its dependence on the presence of an AGN, as well as
on SFR and galaxy environment is analysed in §3. In §4
we present the radial abundance gradients, and address
the eﬀect of beam-smearing.
§5 provides a summary.
Throughout this work, we adopt the Chabrier (2003) ini-
tial mass function and a ﬂat cosmology with ΩM = 0.3
and H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1.

2. THE KMOS3D SAMPLE

The galaxies analysed here are taken from the ﬁrst two
years of the KMOS3D survey, which covers observations
up to April 2015. The survey is described in detail by
Wisnioski et al. (2015). KMOS3D is a ﬁve-year GTO
survey with the multi-object near-IR integral ﬁeld spec-
trograph KMOS at the VLT (Sharples et al. 2013), which
aims to observe a mass-selected sample of > 600 galaxies
at z = 0.7 − 2.7 in Hα emission to study their spatially
resolved kinematics and star formation. Targets are pre-
selected to avoid OH skyline contamination based on a
combination of existing spectroscopic campaigns and 3D-
HST grism redshifts from the v4 catalogs (Brammer et
al. 2012; Momcheva et al. 2015) in the southern CAN-
DELS ﬁelds UDS, COSMOS and GOODS-S (Grogin et
al. 2011; Koekemoer et al. 2011). The availability of
near-IR grism data avoids the bias towards bluer colours
intrinsic in any selection based only on optical spectro-
scopic redshifts. Stellar masses, UV+IR star formation
rates and global extinction values for the sample are de-
rived from the CANDELS photometry (Skelton et al.
2014) and available far-IR photometry (Lutz et al. 2011;

Magnelli et al. 2013), using standard spectral energy dis-
tribution modelling with FAST (Kriek et al. 2009) for a
grid of Bruzual & Charlot (2003) models with exponen-
tially declining star formation histories, Calzetti et al.
(2000) dust extinction, and solar metallicity (see Wuyts,
S. et al. (2011) for details). Morphological parameters
such as inclination and eﬀective radius are available from
GALFIT ﬁtting of the F160W CANDELS data by van
der Wel et al. (2012).

This work includes 419 targets, 176-63-180 each in the
Y J, H and K-bands respectively. The survey strategy
deliberately focused on the z ∼ 0.9 and z ∼ 2.3 red-
shift slices ﬁrst, only now starting to ﬁll in the interme-
diate range at z ∼ 1.5 in H-band. Figure 1 situates the
sample in the star formation vs stellar mass plane. Our
deep integrations (baseline of 4-6-8hrs in Y J, H, and
K respectively) allow us to probe signiﬁcantly below the
main-sequence of star formation, though in this parame-
ter space the detection fraction drops below our average
of 76%, especially in K-band.

The data were reduced with the Software Package for
Astronomical Reduction with KMOS (SPARK, Davies
et al. 2013), complemented with custom IDL scripts for
additional ﬂat ﬁelding, accurate centering and combin-
ing of data taken over multiple epochs, and PSF char-
acterisation. Maps of the Hα ﬂux and kinematics are
derived with the IDL emission line ﬁtting code LINE-
FIT, which was originally developed for SINFONI data
(F¨orster Schreiber et al. 2009; Davies et al. 2011). We
mask out all spatial pixels where the S/N in Hα drops
below 5, as well as outliers in velocity or velocity width
or in their respective uncertainties. More details on the
data reduction and kinematic mapping can be found in
Wisnioski et al. (2015).

Guided by the KMOS3D survey design which targets
primarily Hα emission, we derive gas-phase metallici-
ties from the N2 index, the ratio of [N II] λ6583 to Hα
emission line ﬂuxes. We note a number of known con-
cerns related to this metallicity indicator: contribution
of AGN and shock ionisation to the [NII] emission (fur-
ther addressed in § 3.1), saturation at high metallici-
ties, variations in the N/O ratio and secondary nitrogen
production, and contribution of the warm diﬀuse ISM.
Given these possible biases, we show our results in terms
of the observed [N II]/Hα ratio. When a conversion to
metallicity is required for a comparison to the literature,
the linear conversion by Pettini & Pagel (2004) is used,
12 + log(O/H) = 8.9 + 0.57 × log([N II]/Hα). This carries
a systematic uncertainty of 0.18 dex.

3. THE MASS-METALLICITY RELATION

We create an integrated 1D spectrum for each galaxy
by co-adding all the spatial pixels within the mask after
velocity-shifting each spatial pixel to remove the imprint
of the overall galaxy kinematics. The Hα and [N II] emis-
sion lines are jointly ﬁt with a three-component Gaussian
model, forcing a common redshift and line width, and
constraining the [N II] λ6583/[N II] λ6548 doublet ratio
to its theoretical value of 3.071 (Storey & Zeippen 2000).
Uncertainties are derived via a Monte Carlo approach
where the spectrum is perturbed following its noise spec-
trum. From these ﬁts we derive Hα-based SFRs, cor-

3

rected for dust extinction using the SED-derived redden-
ing and accounting for additional extinction of the nebu-
lar lines following Wuyts, S. et al. (2013). The integrated
[N II] emission is detected at > 3σ for 90% of the sample,
[N II]/Hα ratios are reported in Table 3 in the Appendix.

3.1. AGN contamination

It is well known that the [N II] emission can be con-
taminated by the ionising spectrum of an active galactic
nucleus. There are a number of diﬀerent AGN indicators
in use in the literature, all of which suﬀer from biases and
incompleteness. The “classical” indicators include X-ray
emission, radio emission and mid-IR colours. Keeping in
mind that the coverage and depth of the various surveys
varies across the CANDELS ﬁelds (see Genzel et al. 2014,
for more details), we ﬁnd a typically low percentage of
7% AGN in our KMOS3D sample. Surveys which also
target [O III] and Hβ emission can use the optical BPT
diagnostic diagram (Baldwin et al. 1981) to identify the
presence of AGN in their sample, and typically ﬁnd an-
other ∼10% contamination (Zahid et al. 2014; Sanders et
al. 2015). The KMOS3D survey currently does not cover
the [O III] or Hβ line for the majority of its targets,
but [N II]/Hα alone also serves as a useful diagnostic to
identify AGN from rest-frame optical emission lines at
high redshift (Stasi´nska et al. 2006; Cid Fernandes et al.
2011; Coil et al. 2015). We ﬁnd that 8% of targets in our
sample lie above a threshold [N II]/Hα > 0.6, using the
threshold from Kewley et al. (2001).

The spatially resolved IFU data give access to two ad-
ditional AGN indicators. The AGN contribution to the
line emission is expected to be largest in the nuclear re-
gion of the galaxy, and possibly diluted by the emission
from the outer disk. We therefore create a nuclear spec-
trum for each of our targets by co-adding only the cen-
tral 0.4′′. The nuclear [N II]/Hα ratio lies above 0.6
for an additional 5% of the sample. Secondly, F¨orster
Schreiber et al. (2014) and Genzel et al. (2014) reported
evidence for nuclear AGN-driven outﬂows of ionised gas
based on the presence of a broad underlying component
with FWHM=500-2000 km/s in the line proﬁle of Hα
and the forbidden lines. We visually examine all nuclear
spectra as described by Genzel et al. (2014) and ﬁnd ev-
idence of underlying broad emission for 27% of the sam-
ple analysed in this paper. The incidence of each of the
AGN indicators described above is a strong function of
stellar mass, such that at log(M∗/M⊙) > 10.9, 70% of
the sample satisﬁes one or more of the AGN indicators.

3.2. Stacking

The KMOS3D sample has a high detection rate of
90% for the galaxy-integrated [N II] emission, not un-
surprising given the required depth to spatially resolve
the Hα emission. Nevertheless, we stack our galaxies
in bins of stellar mass to robustly take into account the
upper limits. Similarly to Wuyts, E. et al. (2014), we
use inverse variance weighting of continuum-subtracted,
velocity-corrected and Hα-normalized integrated spec-
tra. The line ﬂuxes and uncertainties are derived as
the jackknife mean and standard error and reported in
Table 1. We aim for 15-20 targets per bin. Figure 2
shows the mass-metallicity relation for the stacked spec-
tra with and without the AGN identiﬁed in the previ-
ous section. The strong dependence of AGN incidence

signiﬁcantly below the main-sequence of star formation.

Fig. 2.— Galaxy-integrated [N II]/Hα ratios as a function of stellar mass for the KMOS3D sample. The right axis expresses galaxy
abundance as 12 + log(O/H) as derived from the linear relation by Pettini & Pagel (2004). The grey datapoints in the background show our
individual detections and upper limits, AGN are surrounded by an open diamond. The large black diamonds and blue circles correspond to
the stacked spectra with and without AGN-identiﬁed targets respectively. The local relation from Kewley & Ellison (2008) is shown with
a dotted line in each panel. The orange squares correspond to the earlier KMOS+SINFONI+LUCI results from Wuyts, E. et al. (2014).
Other studies in the literature include the FMOS survey at z ∼ 1.6 (Zahid et al. 2014, brown dashed), and at z ∼ 2.3 the sample from Erb
et al. (2006) (brown dashed), the KBSS survey (Steidel et al. 2014, dark blue dot dashed) and the MOSDEF survey (Sanders et al. 2015,
dark green dashed). Their MZR relations are represented consistently based on metallicities derived from the N2 indicator and the linear

on stellar mass results in a loss of many of the highest
mass galaxies. However, in the overlapping mass regime
at log(M∗/M⊙) . 10.8, both stacked relations are con-
sistent within the uncertainties, suggesting that in this
mass range the eﬀect of the AGN contribution to the
galaxy-integrated [N II] emission is limited. At higher
masses, the integrated [N II]/Hα ratios are often biased
high.

The results are in excellent agreement with the MZR
presented in Wuyts, E. et al. (2014) based on the ﬁrst
year KMOS3D data, augmented with observations with
SINFONI at the VLT and the long-slit near-IR spectro-
graph LUCI at the Large Binocular Telescope on Mount
Graham, Arizona. The latter two datasets are responsi-
ble for the extension to lower stellar masses, especially in
K-band. Further comparison to the literature at z ∼1.6
is available from the FMOS survey, for 168 galaxies in

the COSMOS ﬁeld observed with the multi-object near-
IR spectrograph FMOS on Subaru (Zahid et al. 2014;
Silverman et al. 2015). The wide ﬁeld of view surveyed
includes many more very massive targets compared to
KMOS3D, but the lack of spatially-resolved data limits
the detection of AGN contributions, which could explain
the somewhat higher abundances at the high mass end,
where we have shown AGN to bias the [N II]/Hα ra-
tios high. Most high-z emission-line science has so far
been carried out at z ∼ 2.3, where the full suite of
rest-frame optical diagnostic lines can be observed in the
near-IR wavelength range. The MZR presented by Erb
et al. (2006) was long the only study with a large sam-
ple (∼ 100) at this redshift, albeit with few individual
[N II] detections. Recently, the new multi-object near-
IR spectrograph MOSFIRE on Keck has changed the
landscape with two large emission-line surveys of many
hundreds galaxies each. The MOSFIRE Deep Evolution

Field (MOSDEF) survey follows a similar target selection
to KMOS3D in the 3D-HST CANDELS ﬁelds observable
from Mauna Kea (Kriek et al. 2015). The Keck Baryonic
Structure Survey (KBSS) targets 15 quasar ﬁelds with a
large sample of spectroscopically conﬁrmed redshifts at
1.5 . z . 3.5 and a wealth of multi-wavelength ancillary
data (e.g. Steidel et al. 2004; Rudie et al. 2012; Steidel
et al. 2014). We have taken care to consistently compare
relations which have been derived with the same N2 in-
dicator and linear Pettini & Pagel (2004) conversion em-
ployed here. Our results are in perfect agreement with
the MOSDEF relation (Sanders et al. 2015), which is re-
assuring given our almost identical parent sample. The
MZR relation reported by KBSS has a shallower slope,
which is likely due to diﬀerences in the selected target
population (Strom et al. 2016, in prep.).

3.3. The Eﬀect of Star Formation Rate

In the local Universe, Ellison et al. (2008) ﬁrst reported
an anti-correlation between metallicity and speciﬁc star
formation rate (sSFR). Further studies showed how in-
cluding the SFR as a second parameter in the mass-
metallicity relation reduces the scatter (Mannucci et al.
2010; Andrews & Martini 2013). There have been claims
that this “fundamental” relation (FMR) between stellar
mass, SFR and galaxy abundance is independent of red-
shift, such that the lower abundances observed at high
redshift at ﬁxed stellar mass are fully explained by the
overall higher SFR at these epochs (e.g. Mannucci et al.
2010; Belli et al. 2013; Henry et al. 2013; Stott et al.
2013). However, the majority of high-z studies report
no dependence of the MZR on star formation rate, or
an oﬀset from the local FMR (Zahid et al. 2014; Wuyts,
E. et al. 2014; Steidel et al. 2014; Troncoso et al. 2014;
Sanders et al. 2015; Grasshorn Gebhardt et al. 2015)

Our data does not show a signiﬁcant trend between
inferred metallicity and sSFR, in contrast to recent re-
sults from the KMOS Redshift One Spectroscopic Sur-
vey (KROSS Magdis et al. 2016). This could be due to a
less complete removal of AGN contamination from their

sample as well as a diﬀerence in survey depth at z ∼ 1
(KMOS3D: ∼ 5hrs; KROSS: ∼ 2.5hrs). To investigate
the dependence on SFR at ﬁxed mass and redshift, we
split our AGN-excluded sample at z ∼ 0.9 and z ∼ 2.3 in
two bins of SFR, using the dust-corrected SFRs derived
from the integrated Hα ﬂux (Figure 3). The intermediate
redshift bin at z ∼ 1.5 does not yet contain suﬃcient tar-
gets. We do not see a signiﬁcant oﬀset between the MZR
separately derived for the low and high SFR bin. This
does not change when we use the photometrically based
SFR estimates from UV+IR broad-band data. The dy-
namic range of the z ∼ 2.3 sample is very limited, but
over the SFR range probed at z ∼ 0.9 in KMOS3D, a sig-
niﬁcant eﬀect on metallicity is seen in the local Universe
(Andrews & Martini 2013).

The equilibrium or “gas-regulator” picture of galaxy
evolution driven by the balance between gas accretion,
star formation and gas outﬂow, naturally ﬁnds a funda-
mental relation between stellar mass, SFR and metal-
licity (e.g. Lilly et al. 2013). The lack of observed cor-
relation remains puzzling, and could signify departures
from the ﬁrst-order assumptions of these simple ana-
lytical equilibrium models. First, however, the possi-
ble caveats related to metallicity measurements based on
strong-line indicators should be more completely under-
stood.

3.4. The Eﬀect of Environment

Local density can have a strong eﬀect on the overall
evolution of galaxies. Speciﬁcally for the galaxy abun-
dance, a denser environment could remove metal-poor
gas from the outskirts of galaxies or result in shorter gas
recycling times (Oppenheimer & Dav´e 2008), enhancing
the observed metallicity. However, oﬀsets in the local

6

MZR of ﬁeld and cluster star-forming galaxies are ob-
servationally and theoretically constrained to < 0.05 dex
(Ellison et al. 2009; Dav´e et al. 2011; Scudder et al. 2012;
Hughes et al. 2013). The few studies carried out to date
in proto-cluster environments at z ∼ 2 mostly limit any
enhancement of the abundance to ≤ 0.15 dex at < 2σ
signiﬁcance (Kulas et al. 2013; Shimakawa et al. 2015;
Kacprzak et al. 2015); Valentino et al. (2015) in contrast
ﬁnd a metal deﬁciency of 0.25 dex at 4σ signiﬁcance for
a cluster at z = 1.99.

With the KMOS3D sample we can for the ﬁrst time
probe the eﬀect of variations in local density on galaxy
abundances for a large sample at high redshift. We char-
acterise each KMOS3D target as a central or satellite
galaxy based on a determination of its mass-rank in an
adaptive aperture and a comparison to simulations (Fos-
sati et al. 2015, Fossati et al. 2016 in prep.). The ex-
pected ∼ 30% satellite galaxies is roughly recovered, ex-
cept at z ∼ 2.3 due to the stronger focus on massive
galaxies in this redshift slice in the ﬁrst two years of
KMOS3D target selection. Central and satellite galaxies
occupy a similar phase space in the SFR - stellar mass
plane, as shown in the top panel of Figure 4. At z ∼ 0.9,
the sample contains enough non-AGN, [N II] detected
satellite galaxies to stack both categories separately in
bins of stellar mass and compare the MZR. We ﬁnd a
metallicity enhancement of 0.06 dex for central galaxies,
though at low signiﬁcance (< 2σ) given the uncertainties.

4. ABUNDANCE GRADIENTS

The spatial distribution of the [N II]/Hα ratio across
individual galaxies contains additional information be-
yond a simple measurement of the galaxy-integrated
abundance. For each target, a set of elliptical annuli
is created, centred on the continuum light, angled along
the kinematic position angle (see Wisnioski et al. 2015)
and with an ellipticity matching the outer Hα contours.
Given the FWHM of our seeing-limited data, we ideally
choose apertures with a width of 0.4′′, or 2 spatial pixels.
However, only 40% of the sample has enough signal-to-
noise over a large enough area to detect [N II] at > 3σ
in three subsequent 2 pixel-wide apertures, which is our
requirement to robustly measure a radial gradient. Espe-
cially in the highest redshift bin at z ∼ 2.3, most galaxies
are too small and for only 17% can a gradient be mea-
sured. Therefore, our default apertures have a width of
0.2′′. Where possible, we have checked that gradients
measured with 0.2′′ and 0.4′′ wide apertures are consis-
tent within the uncertainties. In each aperture, we cre-
ate a velocity-corrected integrated spectrum and jointly
ﬁt the [N II] and Hα emission as described in Section 3.
A linear ﬁt of the [N II]/Hα ratio as a function of the
semi-major axis radius (deﬁned in the middle of each an-
nulus) results in a measurement of the gradient ∆N2/∆r
in dex/kpc. Figure 11 in the Appendix shows the Hα,
velocity and [N II]/Hα map as well as the [N II]/Hα ra-
tio as a function of radius for ﬁve example galaxies to
illustrate the process. We have visually examined each
gradient measurement to avoid catastrophic failures in
the ﬁt.

For the galaxies identiﬁed as having some AGN contri-
bution from one of the indicators described in Section 3.1,
the [N II] emission in the central region could be en-
hanced by the AGN and thus not accurately represent the

metallicity of the ionised gas. In these cases, we exclude
the inner 0.4′′) from the
the inner two apertures (i.e.
radial ﬁt. When only four apertures with robust [N II]
detections exist, only the innermost aperture is excluded.
For these targets, removing two apertures and ﬁtting a
gradient to only the remaining outer two radial bins gives
consistent results. AGN with only three radial [N II] de-
tections are excluded. For the full sample of AGN, the
restricted gradients are on average 0.001 ± 0.02 dex/kpc
ﬂatter, i.e. fully consistent with the full radial gradients,
as can be seen in Figure 5.

The ﬁnal gradient measurements are reported in Ta-
ble 3 in the Appendix. Most of the observed gradients
are ﬂat, only 15/180 targets exhibit a gradient signif-
icantly oﬀset from zero (at > 3σ), of which 13 gradi-
ents are negative and 2 positive. Figure 6 shows the
full sample of measured gradients as a function of stellar
mass in [dex/kpc] and [dex/re] in the top and bottom
panels respectively, color-coded by redshift. Based on a
sequence of 1000 Spearman correlation tests, where we
randomly vary the sample of gradients according to their
uncertainties, the negative correlation with stellar mass
is signiﬁcant at 2.8σ. We ﬁnd a positive correlation with
speciﬁc star formation rate (sSFR) at 2.5σ, the signiﬁ-
cance reduces to 1.5σ when the sSFR is normalised to
the main-sequence at each redshift. Stott et al. (2014)
have similarly reported a weak positive trend with spe-
ciﬁc star formation rate at 2.9σ. No signiﬁcant corre-
lations are present with integrated [N II]/Hα or any of
the dynamical (dispersion, velocity gradient, vobs/σ0) or
structural (eﬀective radius, inclination) properties of the
galaxies.

The somewhat steeper gradients in more massive
galaxies could be due to residual inﬂuence of AGN- or
shock-ionisation on the [N II] emission, since these pro-
cesses are more prevalent at the high mass end. It could
additionally signify stronger inside-out growth in mas-
sive galaxies (e.g. Nelson et al. 2015). Finally, feedback
can more easily redistribute metals in the shallower po-
tential wells of lower mass galaxies, ﬂattening the gradi-
ents. Stott et al. (2014) link the correlation with sSFR
to the inﬂow of metal-poor gas ﬂattening the gradients
of strongly star-forming systems.

4.1. Beam-smearing

Before physically interpreting the observed gradients,
it is crucially important to understand the eﬀects of the
coarse spatial resolution of seeing-limited data on the in-
trinsic abundance gradients of high-redshift galaxies. For
this purpose we have analysed a set of exponential disk
models created with the IDL code dysmal (Cresci et al.
2009; Davies et al. 2011) for a range of inclination and ef-
fective radius. We add [N II] emission assuming a smooth
linear radial gradient with a chosen central [N II]/Hα ra-
tio and slope. The model cubes are convolved with a
Gaussian PSF for a range of assumed FWHM from 0.1′′
for some AO-assisted data to 1.0′′ for seeing-limited data
taken in bad observing conditions, and random noise is
added to achieve a pre-deﬁned signal-to-noise ratio for
the central pixel. Table 2 summarises the default value
(in bold) and explored range for each parameter, chosen
to reﬂect the range of properties found in the KMOS3D
sample. All model cubes are analysed in the exact same

7

Fig. 4.— (Top) SFR vs stellar mass for the KMOS3D sample (as in Figure 1), color-coded as central and satellite galaxies in blue
and orange respectively. We ﬁnd the expected ∼ 30% of satellites (Fossati et al. 2015) at z ∼ 0.9 and z ∼ 1.5, at z ∼ 2.3 the focus on
massive galaxies results in fewer satellite galaxies. Both subsets occupy a similar phase space in this diagram. (Bottom) Galaxy-integrated
[N II]/Hα ratios vs stellar mass (as in Figure 2), color-coded as central and satellite galaxies in blue and orange respectively. Only at

[N II]/Hα ratios at 0.06 dex.

way as described in §4 for the KMOS data.

From this ﬁrst order analysis, we ﬁnd that the beam-
smearing mainly depends on the ratio of the FWHM of
the data to the eﬀective radius of the galaxy, which de-
termines how well it can be resolved radially. The right
panel of Figure 7 additionally shows that more highly-
inclined galaxies and intrinsically steeper gradients are
each aﬀected more, as would be expected. The cen-
tral [N II]/Hα ratio does not matter, as long as one has

enough sensitivity to detect [N II] in the outer disk. And
ﬁnally, the S/N of the central pixel only impacts the un-
certainties, as was also found by Yuan et al. (2013).

The KMOS3D data are taken under mostly uniform
seeing conditions (FWHM=0.55′′ ± 0.09′′). From our
models, we see that we can recover at most 70% of the in-
trinsic gradient for the largest face-on disks, down to only
∼ 25% in the smallest, highly-inclined targets. To com-
pare beam-smearing eﬀects with AO-assisted datasets,
we also ran simulations assuming the PSF properties of
SINFONI+AO observations, for which the PSF is best
characterised with a double-component Gaussian model
to capture the AO-corrected narrow core component with
FWHM=0.16′′ and 86% of the peak ﬂux, and the un-
corrected broad halo underneath with FWHM=0.5′′ and
14% of the peak ﬂux (F¨orster Schreiber et al. 2009,
F¨orster Schreiber et al. 2016, in prep.). The halo causes
a larger beam-smearing eﬀect than measured for a single
Gaussian FWHM of 0.16′′. On average, AO data recov-
ers 65% of the gradient, as opposed to 50% at seeing-
limited resolution. Utilizing the HST grism capabilities

gradient restricted to the outer disk for the galaxies ﬂagged as
AGN. For the orange symbols, the inner 0.4′′ covered by the two
innermost apertures is excluded from the ﬁt, for the blue symbols
we can exclude only the innermost 0.2′′ to keep at least three radial
[N II] detections. The uncertainties for the restricted gradient on
the y-axis are naturally larger due to the fewer radial data points,
but on average the AGN does not signiﬁcantly steepen the derived
linear gradient.

as in Jones et al. (2015), delivers a single narrow PSF
at FWHM∼ 0.2′′ and allows the most accurate gradient
measurement.

Two previous eﬀorts to take into account the ef-
fects of beam-smearing have been made. Yuan et al.
(2013) simulate high-z datacubes with diﬀerent seeing
and S/N values based on the measured central abundance
and abundance gradient for one speciﬁc local galaxy
(IRAS F17222-5953) and recover only 13% of the in-
trinsic gradient when using three uniform radial bins at
FWHM=0.6′′. For the KMOS observations of 20 HiZELS
galaxies at z = 0.8, Stott et al. (2014) perform a simu-
lation of 1000 disk galaxies with a range of inclinations
and input gradients and recover 80% of the intrinsic gra-
dient in a face-on disk at 0.7′′ seeing. For an inclination
of 80◦, this reduces to 30%. This is in contrast to our
results, which only recover 35% at FWHM=0.7′′ and are
much less dependent on inclination. It remains unclear
from where this diﬀerence arises. From our analysis, a
large dependence on inclination is unexpected, since the
use of elliptical apertures along the major axis following
the axis ratio of the Hα contours is designed to mostly
take this into account.

Under the assumption that we know the eﬀective ra-
dius and inclination of each KMOS3D target from GAL-
FIT modelling of the F160W CANDELS photometry
(van der Wel et al. 2012), and that the line emission
mostly follows the stellar light as traced by the F160W
continuum, we can derive the necessary beam-smearing
correction from our set of models. Figure 12 in the Ap-
pendix visualises how this is done for three examples.
For a known combination of FWHM, inclination and ef-
fective radius, a certain intrinsic gradient will be beam-

in [dex/kpc], in the bottom panel they have been normalised to

weighted average for the full sample. The black line is a simple 1D

smeared into a unique observed gradient. We derive this
match for a range of intrinsic gradients between -0.2 and
0.2 dex/kpc for each target, and then simply invert this
correlation to derive the intrinsic gradient that corre-
sponds to the actual observed gradient of the target. A
histogram of the resulting beam-smearing correction fac-
tors and corrected gradients for the full sample is shown
in Figure 8. We caution that each corrected gradient in
this histogram has large uncertainties. We re-investigate
correlations between the now-intrinsic gradients and the
stellar population, structural and kinematic parameters
and again do not ﬁnd any statistically signiﬁcant trends.
Finally, we note that these corrections are derived un-
der the assumption of a smooth, linear radial gradient.

from face-on (inc=0◦) to almost edge-on (inc=60◦). In the left panel, the x-axis represents the FWHM of the observations divided by the
eﬀective radius for re = 0.3, 0.6 and 1.0′′. The other parameters (central [N II]/Hα value (n2c), intrinsic gradient (grad) and S/N) are kept
at their default values as speciﬁed in Table 2. The ratios have all been derived at the same discretised set of input FWHM, but to improve
the clarity of the ﬁgure we have shifted the data points for diﬀerent eﬀective radii slightly along the x-axis. Gradients are more aﬀected by
beam-smearing for larger ratios of seeing versus galaxy size. The right panel compares the ratio of the recovered vs intrinsic gradient as a
function of the FWHM of the observations for diﬀerent intrinsic gradients and central [N II]/Hα ratios. In this panel the eﬀective radius
is kept ﬁxed at its default value of 0.5′′. The positions along the x-axis have similarly been shifted to improve the clarity of the ﬁgure. A
shallower intrinsic gradient is less aﬀected by beam-smearing, while the central N2 ratio has no impact. The black-edged symbols shown
at FWHM∼ 0.16′′ correspond to the double component PSF of SINFONI+AO data.

of high redshift star-forming galaxies, this might be too
strong of a simpliﬁcation. In future work we will explore
this in more detail with hydrodynamical simulations.

4.2. Gradients in Interacting Systems

In the local Universe, galaxies undergoing an interac-
tion show ﬂattened gradients (e.g. Kewley et al. 2010;
Rupke et al. 2010b; S´anchez et al. 2014). This is ex-
pected from simulations, as the interaction causes inﬂows
of metal-poor gas from the outskirts into the galaxy cen-
tre (Rupke et al. 2010b; Perez et al. 2011). At high red-
shift, the situation remains unclear. For their samples of
lensed galaxies, Jones et al. (2013) and Leethochawalit
et al. (2015) report shallower gradients for the merging
or dynamically disturbed systems. Similarly, four out
of the seven galaxies with a positive abundance gradi-
ent in the seeing-limited MASSIV sample at z ∼ 1.2 are
interacting (Queyrel et al. 2012). In contrast, Cresci et
al. (2010) and Troncoso et al. (2014) ﬁnd positive gra-
dients in rotating disks, which would require the inﬂow
of metal-poor gas into the galaxy centre through minor
mergers, cold ﬂows or violent disk instabilities (e.g. Dekel
& Burkert 2014; Zolotov et al. 2015).

Within the KMOS3D sample, we ﬁnd only a handful of
galaxies with a statistically signiﬁcant positive gradient.
Wisnioski et al. (2015) deﬁne a sample of pairs based on a
search for companions in the 3D-HST catalog with a ve-
locity separation of 500 km/s, expected to fall within the
IFU of the primary target - this roughly translates to a
projected separation of 1.5′′ or 12 kpc. There are 39 such
targets in the sample, for which we can recover 18 gradi-
ents. Additionally, one of the companion galaxies is suﬃ-
ciently detected and extended for an additional gradient
measurement. We also extend our deﬁnition of pairs to
the more commonly used projected separation < 50 kpc
(restricted to spectroscopic redshifts), and classify 4 ad-
ditional KMOS3D targets with a gradient measurement
as interacting, for a total sample of 23. Figure 9 com-
pares the 23 gradients in interacting systems to the full
KMOS3D sample. The median gradient of 0.005 ± 0.008
(standard deviation 0.036) is not signiﬁcantly ﬂattened
compared to the full median of −0.008 ± 0.003 (stan-
dard deviation 0.035). A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indi-
cates a likelihood of 29% that both sets originate from
the same parent sample. When ﬁrst applying the beam-
smearing correction, we ﬁnd 0.011 ± 0.016 (standard de-
viation 0.08) for the pairs and −0.015 ± 0.008 (standard
deviation 0.10) for the full sample, with a KS-test likeli-
hood of 31%.

4.3. Evolution of Metallicity Gradients with Cosmic

Time

Figure 10 compiles available abundance gradients from
the literature as a function of redshift.
For this
compilation, we convert our gradients in [N II]/Hα
(∆N2/∆r) into abundance gradients ∆Z/∆r by multi-
plying with a factor 0.57 in accordance with the lin-
ear conversion by Pettini & Pagel (2004).
In the lo-
cal Universe, the median gradient for a sample of iso-
lated spiral galaxies from Rupke et al. (2010b) and
Zaritsky et al. (1994) is -0.04±0.05 dex/kpc. The
open square symbol shows the ﬂatter gradient of
−0.0165 dex/kpc for galaxies currently undergoing an

The diﬀerence is not statistically signiﬁcant. The orange and
blue arrows indicate the median gradient of −0.008 ± 0.003 and

the uncertainties, the interacting systems do not show signiﬁcantly
ﬂatter gradients.

interaction (Rupke et al. 2010b). These studies use
the R23 metallicity indicator of ([O II] λλ 3727,3729
+ [O III] λ4959 + [O III] λ5007)/Hβ. Rupke et
al. (2010b) compare their results to abundances cal-
culated from [N II] λ6583/[O II] λλ 3727,3729 and
([O III] λ5007)/Hβ)/([N II] λ6583/Hα) (the O3N2 in-
dicator), and ﬁnd no systematic diﬀerence after calibrat-
ing the diﬀerent indicators following Kewley & Ellison
(2008). At high redshift, abundance gradients are almost
exclusively derived from the [N II]/Hα ratio, since it only
requires observations in one band and is insensitive to
dust correction. Jones et al. (2013) and Leethochawalit
et al. (2015) additionally measure O3N2 for a subset of
their samples and ﬁnd consistent results. The grism data
from Jones et al. (2015), and the z > 3 sample from
Troncoso et al. (2014) do not have access to Hα, and
use the R23 diagnostic instead. For the literature sam-
ple in Figure 10, the star symbols correspond to lensed
galaxies with AO, diamonds are non-lensed galaxies with
AO, and squares show seeing-limited data. Open sym-
bols show interacting or disturbed systems, as deﬁned
in the various papers from kinematic classiﬁcation, vi-
sual inspection of broad-band imaging, or a combination
of both. For KMOS3D, we use the pair classiﬁcation as
described above.

With the availability of larger samples, the steep abun-
dance gradients found in lensed galaxies by Jones et al.
(2013) and Yuan et al. (2011) that spurred much of the
initial debate on the feasibility of gradient measurements
in ﬁeld galaxies, as well as the idea of a strong ﬂat-
tening of gradients over cosmic time, now seem more

Open symbols refer to interacting or disturbed systems, as deﬁned in the various papers. In the local Universe, the ﬁlled/open black square
shows the median gradient for a sample of isolated spiral galaxies (Rupke et al. 2010b; Zaritsky et al. 1994) and interacting spiral systems
(Rupke et al. 2010b) respectively. The star symbols refer to gravitationally lensed galaxies (Yuan et al. 2011; Jones et al. 2013, 2015;
Leethochawalit et al. 2015); diamonds have AO-assisted data (Swinbank et al. 2012, F¨orster Schreiber et al. 2016 (in prep.)); squares have
only seeing-limited data (Queyrel et al. 2012; Stott et al. 2014; Troncoso et al. 2014). KMOS3D data is represented by small black open
or closed circles. To aid visibility, the grey background squares indicate the spread of the KMOS3D measurements in the three redshift
intervals. In the right panel, the KMOS3D galaxies have been corrected for the eﬀect of beam-smearing. We additionally plot diﬀerent
theoretical predictions for the time evolution of abundance gradients from Pilkington et al. (2012) based on simulations in Rahimi et al.
(2011); Kobayashi & Nakasato (2011); Few et al. (2012); Gibson et al. (2013).

like outliers. These lensed galaxies have lower stellar
masses than typically targeted in the other surveys (the
three steepest gradients in Figure 10 were measured for
log(M∗/M⊙) = 9.7 and 9.9 (Jones et al. 2013) and a
dynamical mass of 10.42 M⊙ (Yuan et al. 2011)), but
there is still overlap. The KMOS3D survey for example
probes down to log(M∗/M⊙) = 9.7, as can be seen in
Figure 6. Also, the larger study of lensed galaxies in
Leethochawalit et al. (2015) did not uncover any addi-
tional steep gradients.

In the right panel of Figure 10, the KMOS3D gradients
are corrected for beam-smearing. We can not extend this
correction to the literature data, since we do not always
know the FWHM, eﬀective radius and inclination of the
targets. Overplotted are models for the evolution of gra-
dients over time from Rahimi et al. (2011); Kobayashi
& Nakasato (2011); Few et al. (2012) and Gibson et al.
(2013) as derived by Pilkington et al. (2012). The red
open and ﬁlled diamonds compare the normal and en-
hanced feedback mode for the same simulation from Gib-
son et al. (2013). There is large scatter in the observed
gradients, and remaining uncertainty with regards to the
beam-smearing correction, but based on these models,
the scarcity of gradients much steeper than -0.1 dex/kpc
at z ∼ 2 suggests the need for strong feedback.

5. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

This work takes advantage of the large sample size and
wide redshift coverage of the KMOS3D near-IR IFU sur-
vey to infer the integrated metal abundance and abun-
dance gradient of star-forming galaxies at the peak of
cosmic star formation activity between z = 0.6 − 2.6
from the [N II]/Hα ﬂux ratio. Such measurements can
shed crucial light on the main physical processes driving
the assembly of stellar mass and heavy elements in the
Universe. Our main conclusions are as follows:

• Our mass-metallicity relation conﬁrms previous lit-
erature results. Excluding AGN reduces sensi-
tivity at the high-mass end, but does not sig-
niﬁcantly change the relation at lower masses
(log(M∗/M⊙) . 10.8). We do not ﬁnd a signiﬁ-
cant eﬀect of SFR, sSFR or galaxy environment on
the observed [N II]/Hα ratios.

• A thorough analysis of the eﬀect of beam-smearing
in seeing-limited data at high redshift shows that
one can recover between 30% and 70% of the in-
trinsic abundance gradient, depending mostly on
the ratio of the FWHM of the data to the eﬀective
radius, and to a lesser extent on galaxy inclination.

• The majority of observed [N II]/Hα gradients are
ﬂat. Cosmological simulations suggest the need for
strong feedback to create ﬂat abundance gradients
at high redshift. No statistically signiﬁcant corre-
lations with stellar, kinematic or structural galaxy

12

properties are found.

A number of factors could cause intrinsically ﬂat abun-
dance gradients. One eﬀect is the radial inﬂow of metal-
poor gas and metal-mixing caused by a merger. In the
local Universe, this has been established to cause shal-
lower gradients, both observationally and in simulations
(Rupke et al. 2010a,b). At high redshift, the merger frac-
tion remains highly debated with most observational re-
sults pointing to consistent or higher fractions than found
locally (e.g. Lotz et al. 2008; Man et al. 2012; L´opez-
Sanjuan et al. 2014; Lackner et al. 2014). However, not
all high-z surveys systematically ﬁnd shallower gradients
for disturbed systems, as discussed in Sections 4.2 and
4.3.

A second important physical process is feedback, which
can blow out metal-rich gas from the centre and redis-
tribute it at larger radii. The ubiquitous presence of
both AGN and star formation driven feedback is well es-
tablished at high redshift, especially at high mass and
star formation surface density (e.g. Newman et al. 2012;
Genzel et al. 2014).

Aside from these physical eﬀects, one has to take into
account the various reasons why the observed gradient
could be ﬂat. Beam-smearing is the most important fac-
tor here, and while we have attempted to address this,
signiﬁcant uncertainties remain. Secondly, in analogy
with local SFGs, the fraction of warm diﬀuse ionised gas

increases in radial apertures further out in the galaxy
disks, and could strongly bias the measured line ratios
there (Yuan et al. 2011). Adaptive-optics assisted data
reaches the resolution of massive star-forming clumps at
z ∼ 2 and could thus minimise this eﬀect, but the uncor-
rected seeing-limited halo still contributes to the beam-
smearing correction (Figure 7). Space-based grism data
is more suited, but struggles with sensitivity.

Similar biases are introduced when shock fronts al-
ter the photo-ionization conditions of the interstellar
medium (e.g. Kewley et al. 2013; Newman et al. 2014).
These biases aﬀect any abundance indicator based on
rest-frame optical emission line ratios, but have espe-
cially signiﬁcant eﬀects for the N2 indicator. Spatially
resolved coverage of multiple lines would allow better
rejection of spatial pixels inﬂuenced by AGN or shock
ionisation based on the BPT diagram.

This analysis has highlighted the need for high-quality
data with suﬃcient spatial resolution, S/N and wave-
length coverage to disentangle the physical processes
driving the observed line ratios and to pin down the in-
trinsic abundance gradients. Our understanding of the
global and resolved metallicity distributions among and
within SFGs, as well as their cosmic evolution, will ben-
eﬁt greatly from the added resolution and sensitivity of
JWST and the ELTs.

Fig. 11.— Illustration of how abundance gradients are measured for ﬁve example galaxies. The three panels on the left show the Hα,
velocity and [N II]/Hα maps respectively, where in the latter only pixels with S/N> 3 in [N II] are shown. In each panel, the black open
diamond corresponds to the continuum centre. The Hα map additionally shows the Hα contours, and the kinematic position angle is shown
on the velocity map. Based on the centre, PA and ellipticity of the outer Hα contours, we create one-pixel wide elliptical apertures as
shown on top of the [N II]/Hα map in the third column. The chosen ellipticity does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the measured gradient. The
rightmost panels show the [N II]/Hα ratios as a function of semi-major axis radius for these apertures. The red data points correspond
to the wider 2 pixel or 0.4′′ apertures. The integrated [N II]/Hα ratio and its uncertainty are indicated by the orange horizontal line and
yellow band. The dark grey shaded band is the best-ﬁt gradient and uncertainty. The middle 3 galaxies are each identiﬁed as an AGN.
In this case we exclude the inner one or two apertures as indicated by the vertical grey shaded region, and reﬁt the remaining outer data
points (magenta line). For the third and fourth galaxy, both ﬁts are consistent. The second row shows an example where the [N II]/Hα
ratios in the centre are signiﬁcantly elevated due to the AGN, such that the outer gradient is much ﬂatter.

Fig. 12.— This ﬁgure provides three examples of the beam-smearing correction and intrinsic metallicity gradient. In each panel, the
horizontal grey band and black line show the observed gradient and its uncertainty. The black circles correspond to the gradient we would
have observed for a range of intrinsic gradients from -0.2 to 0.2 dex/kpc, given the known seeing, inclination and eﬀective radius of the
target. We ﬁt a polynomial to this correlation, and invert it to derive the intrinsic gradient and uncertainties which corresponds to the
gradient we actually observed in the data. This is shown by the orange star and orange vertical lines. The observed and intrinsic gradients
are noted in [dex/kpc] in the bottom of each panel. In the right panel, the relation between observed and intrinsic gradient is very ﬂat due
to the small eﬀective radius and high inclination of the target, requiring a large correction. This additionally causes large uncertainties on
the intrinsic gradient compared to the observed uncertainties.
