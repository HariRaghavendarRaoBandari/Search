Abstract

In this paper, we present a thorough stress analysis of the Cu-Zr metallic-glass composite

with embedded B2 particles subject to a martensitic transformation. Within the framework

of the Eshelby theory, we are able to explain, in a quantitative manner, (1) the formation

of three types of shear bands with distinct morphologies as observed experimentally in the

severely deformed Cu-Zr metallic-glass composite and (2) the work hardening ability of the

Cu-Zr metallic-glass composite as related to the coupled eﬀects of elastic back stress and

elastic mismatch caused by the martensitic transformation. Furthermore, we also discuss

the issues about the stress aﬀected zone of the individual B2 phase and the stability of the

crystalline-amorphous interface. Given the general agreement between the theoretical and

experimental ﬁndings, we believe that the outcome of our current work can lead to a deeper

understanding of the transformation-induced plasticity in the Cu-Zr based metallic glass

composites, which should be very useful to the design of the metallic-glass composites with

improved ductility.

1. Introduction

Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs)(Chen, 2011; Wang et al., 2004) are a new class of ad-

vanced materials, which have attractive mechanical properties such as high strengths and

large elastic limits arising from their long-range disorder atomic structure. Nevertheless,

their applicability as structural materials is largely suppressed by the poor ductility(Ashby

and Greer, 2006; Fornell et al., 2009; Greer et al., 2013; Schuh et al., 2007; Zhou et al.,

2013), which has been regarded as the Achill’s heel of BMGs. At room temperature, plas-

ticity in BMGs is an inhomogeneous process with plastic strain highly localized into shear

bands(Chen and Lin, 2010; Chen et al., 2013; Greer et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2014; Jiang

et al., 2008). Once initiated, shear bands are prone to becoming unstable due to strain soften-

ing, causing the catastrophic failure of a BMG sample along the main shear plane(Chen and

Dai, 2016; Shimizu et al., 2006; Sun and Wang, 2015; Wu et al., 2015). Consequently, this

results in almost zero tensile ductility or very limited compressive plasticity at the macro-

scopic scale(Sun et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2011a; Zhang et al., 2003). In the past decades,

tremendous eﬀorts(Choi-Yim et al., 1999; Eckert et al., 1998; Hays et al., 2000; Hofmann

et al., 2008a,b; Jang et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2004; Lewandowski et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2007;

Tong et al., 2016; Yoo et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2009)have been made to overcome the intrinsic

weakness of BMG, among which one eﬀective approach is to fabricate BMG matrix com-

posites(Choi-Yim et al., 1999; Hofmann et al., 2008b; Lee et al., 2004). This often involves

ex-situ or in-situ introduction of secondary crystalline phases into a glassy matrix. Based on

this approach, signiﬁcant tensile ductility was achieved in some Zr-(Hofmann et al., 2008a)

and Ti-based BMG(Hofmann et al., 2008b) composites. However, in the early development,

the BMG composites still displayed macroscopic strain softening under tension(Hofmann

et al., 2008a), which led to necking instability upon yielding, a phenomenon that is not

desirable in engineering applications.

Recently, CuZr-based BMG composites(Gargarella et al., 2014; Hofmann, 2010; Liu et al.,

2012; Pauly et al., 2010a; Song et al., 2012a; Wu et al., 2011b, 2010) have attracted a great

deal of research interest because of their unique mechanical properties. Unlike other types

2

of BMG composites, these CuZr-based BMG composites comprise shape-memory B2 CuZr

crystalline phases, which could undergo martensitic transformation (MT) during deforma-

tion and turn into the B19’ phase. By a careful control of the size and distribution of the

B2 phases, it has been shown(Pauly et al., 2010b; Wu et al., 2010) that these composites

can exhibit signiﬁcant tensile ductility and also display pronounced work-hardening, an in-

dispensable ”ingredient” for the practical application of structural materials. Apparently,

these superior mechanical properties are derived from the interaction between the MT of

B2 phases and the plastic ﬂow ”carriers”, i.e. shear bands, in the glassy matrix. Further-

more, it was proposed that the transformation of B2 might exert a compressive stress on the

glassy matrix and thus retards the rapid propagation of shear bands and/or cracks(Hofmann,

2010; Pauly et al., 2010b). To validate this proposition, ﬁnite element (FE) simulations were

utilized to obtain the stress/strain ﬁelds in the deformed BMG composites using the com-

mercial packages(Gargarella et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2011b); however, these

preliminary analyses are generally insuﬃcient because the transient phase transformation

behavior of the B2 phase is not considered in the constitutive model of the commercial

FE software(Leblond et al., 1989). Therefore, to understand the mechanisms underlying

the tensile plasticity in the CuZr-based BMG composites, a precise knowledge of the stress

redistribution around the transforming B2 phases is still lacking.

In this study, we develop a micromechanical model based on the Eshelby theory(Eshelby,

1957; Weinberger C, 2005) to understand the plasticity associated with the MT of B2 in

the CuZr BMG composites. It will be shown that the model predictions, such as the stress

state and the resultant distribution of shear bands and strain hardening coeﬃcient, compare

very well with the experimental observations. Our current study provides a quantitative un-

derstanding of the mechanisms underlying the strain hardened plasticity in the CuZr-based

BMG composites, which should be also helpful for a better control of the microstructure in

BMG based composites with improved mechanical properties.

2. Experiments and Results

2.1. Sample Preparations and Experimental Set-Up

Master alloy ingot with a nominal composition Cu48Zr48Al4 were prepared by arc melting

the mixture of the constitute elements with purity > 99.5% in a Ti-getted atmosphere. Each

alloys ingots were remelted at least three times for the compositional homogeneity. Plate

samples with a thickness of 2 mm, a width of 10 mm and a length about 80 mm were

obtained by suction casting into the copper mould. As the morphology of B2 phase is

very sensitive to experimental condition in casting process such as the cooling rate and the

quench temperature, we control the melting temperature by applying the arc current of 320

A on each alloy ingot for about 20 second before quenching to ensure the microstructure
reproducibility of the BMG composite. The specimens with a dimension of about 2 × 2 × 4
mm were cut from the lowest part of the plate (the part with the highest cooling rate) with

a diamond saw, and then carefully ground into samples with an aspect ratio of 2:1 for the

compression tests. The four side faces of samples are also carefully polished for the structural

characterization after deformation. The uniaxial compression tests were performed with an

Instron 5869 electromechanical test system with the maximum load of 50 KN at a constant
strain rate of 2.5 × 10−4s−1. The strain were measured by a laser extensometer (Fiedler)
attached to the testing machine. Each compression test was repeated at least three times

to ensure the reproducibility of deformation results. After deformation, the morphology of

the shear bands as well as the fracture surface are investigated by the scanning electron

microscopy (SEM, Gemini 1530).The structure nature of as-cast as well as post-deformed

samples is examined by the X-ray diﬀraction (XRD, PANalytical X’Pert PRO) with Co-Ka

radiation (the wave length λ = 1.7902 nm) and an Zeiss Axiophot Optical Microscopy (OM).

2.2. Microstructures of the Cu48Zr48Al4 BMG Composite

At ﬁrst, we need to choose a CuZr-based BMG as the base material. According to the

previous study(Qiao et al., 2016; Yu and Bai, 2008), the glass-forming ability (GFA) and

plasticity of the Cu-Zr-Al ternary BMGs strongly depends on the content of Al. On one
hand, it was reported that, when the content of Al is around 4∼5% (in atomic percent),

4

the Cu-Zr-Al BMGs could possess a relatively large value of Poisson’s ratio and show a

plastic strain of 18% before failure(Das et al., 2005; Yu and Bai, 2008). On the other hand,

the Cu48Zr48Al4 BMG can be cast into a fully amorphous 2-mm-diameter rod or a 1-mm-

thickness plate(Mei-Bo et al., 2004), indicative of a very good GFA better than that of the

typical binary Cu50Zr50 BMG. It was noticed that further addition of Al into the Cu48Zr48Al4

BMG would enhance the GFA but greatly deteriorate the plasticity. Therefore, we ﬁnally

chose the Cu48Zr48Al4 BMG as the matrix material and cast it into a 2-mm-thick plate to

obtain the BMG composite. Figure 1 shows the typical XRD pattern of the as-cast sample

taken from the lowest part of the plate (the part with highest cooling rate), from which

one can clearly see the crystalline peaks superimposed on the broad halo of the amorphous

matrix. The majority of the crystalline peaks can be easily identiﬁed to be the B2 CuZr phase

while the (001) peak of the martensitic phase B19’ could be also found, suggesting a small

volume fraction of the B19’ phase in the as-cast sample. In Ref.34, a similar phenomenon

was observed and the small amount of the B19’ phase was attributed to the residual-stress

induced martensitic transformation of the B2 phase during solidiﬁcation(Song et al., 2012b).

After the deformed to 8%, obvious crystalline peaks of the martensite phase (B19’) appeared

in the XRD pattern (see Fig.1(b)), indicating that some B2 phases underwent a martensite

phase transition during the deformation.

As aforementioned, the size, morphology and distribution of the B2 CuZr phase in the

glassy matrix are very sensitive to the alloy composition and experimental parameters, such

as the cooling rate and the melting temperature employed for the casting process(Pauly

et al., 2009; Song et al., 2012a; Wu et al., 2011b). Furthermore, recent studies(Liu et al.,

2012) also showed that a homogeneous distribution of B2 particles could be achieved by

the minor addition of some alloying elements, such as Co and Ta, into the glassy matrix.

Figure 2 displays the morphology and distribution of the B2 CuZr phase on the cross-

sections of our as-cast samples. As seen in this ﬁgure, there is a homogeneous distribution

of the spherical B2 phases in the glassy matrix, which is diﬀerent from those typically

reported Cu-Zr-Al composites, where the heterogeneous distribution of the B2 phases and

even the dendritic structure can be found(Pauly et al., 2009; Song et al., 2012a). As shown

composites. The B2 phase and martensite phase are identiﬁed.

6

in Fig.2, the diameters of these spherical particles are in the range of 25-100 µ m with an
estimated average of ∼42 µm. Here, it is worth noting that the spherical B2 phases are
distributed in the 3D glassy matrix and therefore their volume fraction can be not simply

estimated from the 2D cross sectional view, as shown in Fig.2. However, by assuming a thin

foil projection(Pauly et al., 2010a), the volume fraction of the B2 phases can be roughly

estimated as:

fB2 = (

−2πDB2
πDB2 + 8t

) ln(1 − A)

(1)

where DB2 is the mean diameter of B2 spheres (here, DB2 = 42 µm), t is the thickness of

the foil and is roughly equal toDB2, and A is the project area fraction from the cross section
(for example, A ≈ 8% for Fig.2a). The volume fraction of B2 CuZr phase calculated by Eq.1
is about 5-8% for all the samples obtained via the copper-mold casting after an appropriate

selection of the casting parameters.

2.3. The Stress-Strain Curve of Cu48Zr48Al4 BMG Composite

Subsequently we performed uniaxial compression tests on the Cu48Zr48Al4 composite

samples. To investigate shear band evolution, the compression tests were deliberately

stopped at the diﬀerent strains (4%, 8%) for an SEM observation. Figure 3 shows the

typical stress-strain curves obtained from these composites. By comparison, these curves
display the similar yield strength ∼1.5 GPa or the elastic limit of ∼2% with those of the
corresponding monolithic BMGs; however, the BMG composite exhibits much better ductil-

ity with a plastic strain at least 10% before the ﬁnal failure occurs. More importantly, work

hardening can be observed during the deformation of the present BMG composite although

it may not be as pronounced as that reported in the previous studies[20, 35], which may be

due to the small volume fraction of the B2 phases (5-8%) in the current composite. Finally,

the BMG composite sample failed by the shear fracture along two shear planes initiated from

two adjacent sample sides [Fig.4(c)], rather than alone one single primary fracture plane as

seen for most monolithic BMGs. In addition, a close examination of the stress-strain curves

7

Figure 2: The microstructure of as-cast Cu48Zr48Al4 metallic glass composite plate under optical micro-

scope. One can see that spherical B2 phases are homogeneously distributed in the glassy matrix.

8

Figure 3: The stress-strain curves of Cu48Zr48Al4 metallic glass composites deformed to diﬀerent strain

levels (4%, 8% and ﬁnal fracture) in compression. The inset shows that the stress begins to deviate the

linear elasticity at about 1 GPa before the nominal yielding point.

(see the enlarged view in the rectangular region in Fig.3) shows that the deviation of the
stress-strain curves from linear elasticity occurs at ∼1 GPa before the nominal yielding point
sets out at ∼1.5 GPa. This is similar to the ﬁrst-yielding-point phenomenon as seen in the
triple-yielding-behavior of the CuZr-based BMG composites that contain a large volume

fraction of B2 phases(Song et al., 2012b). This makes sense since the activation stress for

MT of B2 is known to be lower than the typical yielding strength of a glassy matrix(Pauly
et al., 2009). Therefore, the initial yielding point of ∼1 GPa (it makes sense to see that the
yield stress of B2 is much less than BMG materials) as we herein observed strongly indicates

that the MT of B2 occurs prior to the overall yielding of the composite, which causes stress

redistribution in the glassy matrix and thus aﬀects the subsequent shear banding, as will be

discussed in the later text.

2.4. Shear-Band Morphology in BMG Composite

After the deformation, the surface shear-band morphology was systematically investi-

gated under SEM. As shown in Fig. 4, multiple shear bands can be clearly observed.

Especially, many ﬁne and wavy shear bands can be found around the crystalline phases.
These shear bands are sparsely distributed at the relatively low strain∼4% and gradually
become densely populated across the whole sample with the increasing strain, as shown in

Fig. 4(b) and (c), respectively. A careful examination of these SEM images reveals that

these complex shear bands can be classiﬁed into three types. As indicated by the black

arrows in Fig. 5, the type-I shear bands are within the glassy matrix and away from the

crystalline particles. Like the shear bands in monolithic BMGs(Sun et al., 2010), the type-I
shear bands are oriented along the inclined direction of about 45◦ to the loading direction,

conforming to the direction of the maximum shear stress. Here it is worth mentioning that

the type-I shear bands could be deﬂected and change their direction of propagation when

they approach the crystalline particles, as shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c). By comparison, the

Type-II shear bands seemingly ”emanate” from the crystalline phases and are well aligned

along the direction of the martensitic transformation ”stripes”. Compared to the type-I

shear bands, these type-II shear bands are short and ﬁnely spaced, which disappear within

a short distance from the glass/crystalline interface, as indicated by the red arrows in Fig.

5. Since the B2 particles embedded in the glassy matrix have diﬀerent crystal orientations,

the direction of the martensitic transformation ”stripes” also varies from one particle to an-

other. As a result, there is no ﬁxed direction for the type-II shear bands. Finally, it is worth

pointing out that the type-III shear bands, are also attached with the crystalline phases

and are oriented along the ﬁxed direction perpendicular to the loading axis, as indicated by

blue arrows. According to our SEM observations, the three types of shear bands mutually

interact and intersect with each other, which contributes to the overall plasticity in the

BMG composite and also provides the vivid experimental evidence to decode the underlying

deformation mechanisms.

3. Theory

Theoretically, the martensitic transformation of the embedded B2 phase results in a

stress and strain redistribution in the glassy matrix, which may cause the deﬂection of a

propagating shear band, such as the type-I shear band (Fig. 5(d)), and/or even aﬀect the

initiation of an embryonic shear band, such as the type-II and the type-III shear band

(Fig. 5a), during the transience of a phase transformation, However, this transient eﬀect is

diﬃcult to simulate in the conventional FEM(Leblond et al., 1989) only dealing with quasi-

static equilibrium. Unlike the previous studies(Liu et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2011b), here

we derive the analytical expressions for the stress/strain ﬁeld arising from the martensitic

transformation of the B2 phases by using the Eshelby theory(Eshelby, 1957; Weinberger C,

2005). Before proceeding, it is worth noting that, in Eshelby theory(Eshelby, 1957), a region

is termed as an inclusion if it has the same elastic constants as the ”matrix” material while a

region is termed as an inhomogeneity if it does not. For consistency, the same terminologies

are also adopted in the following analysis.

In principle, a typical Eshelby problem, which entails the inelastic deformation of inclu-

sion/inhomogeneity in an elastic matrix, can be solved following three imaginary steps(Eshelby,

1957). As shown schematically in Fig. 6, at step I, one takes an inclusion out of the matrix

and let it undergo an unconstrained transformation as characterized by the transformation

strain ﬁeld T

ij ; at step II, elastic surface tractions σT

ij are imposed onto the surface of the

transformed inclusion such that it can ﬁt back into the original matrix; at step III, the

surface tractions are removed while the inelastic deformation remains, which leads to the

stress/strain redistribution in the inclusion and elastic matrix. Since previous experimental

studies(Pauly et al., 2009) already showed that the elastic constants of the B2 phase are very

close to those of the glassy matrix, the B2 phase can be here treated as an Eshelby inclusion,

which is inserted in the homogeneous glassy matrix with the shear modulus G and Pois-

son’s ratio ν. Following the Eshelby’s approach as described above, we obtain the following

expression for the elastic strain C

ij in the matrix which is caused by the inelastic strain,

occurring to a spherical inclusion with a radius a, during the martensitic transformation

After the B2 phase is transformed into the martensitic phase, elastic mismatch arises

because the newly formed martensitic phase possesses elastic constants diﬀerent from the

glassy matrix according to the previous experiments(Pauly et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010).

Consequently, this gives rise to an elastic stress ﬁeld, which may be termed as elastic con-

straining stress, being superimposed onto the applied stress . According to the Eshelby

theory(Eshelby, 1957), the eﬀect of the elastic mismatch on the stress/strain distribution

4. Analysis and Discussion

4.1. Shear band distribution around crystalline phases

Based on the above analyses, we obtained the analytical expressions for the stress/strain

ﬁelds in the amorphous matrix composite during the transience of the martensitic transfor-

mation and after the transformation. Next, we would study the shear band formation in the

BMG composite based on these important results. For simplicity, let us neglect the subtle

pressure eﬀect(Schuh et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2015), although there is no technical diﬃculty

to incorporate the pressure eﬀect into the current analysis, and assume that shear band for-

mation in the glassy matrix simply follows von Mises stress criterion. For the stress ﬁeld σij

(σij = (1/3)σmmδij+(cid:48)σij), the von Mises stress is calculated according to: σv =(cid:112)(3/2)sijsij

with sij =(cid:48)σij.

First, let us calculate the instantaneous stress ﬁeld during the martensitic transformation

16

of the B2 phases. Since the martensitic transformation is essentially shearing induced, the

transformation strain (or eigenstrain) T

ij is traceless or does not involve any volumetric

ii = 0). Consequently, the traceless strain tensor T

change (T
ij =
2(λn + λk)ninj + 2(λk + λn)kikj − (λn + λk)δij where λn, λm, λk are the eigenvalues of the
deformation tensor or the three principal strains with the principal axes aligning along the

ij can be written as T

unit vectors in a Cartesian coordinate system(Dasgupta et al., 2013, 2012). Here, we choose

Fig. 7). As such, T

ij can be simpliﬁed into the form of plane strain: T

the coordinates so that the principal axis with the unit vector m coincides with the z axis (see
ij = T ∗ (2ninj − δij),
where T is the magnitude of the transformation strain. Note that all components of the

strain tensor T
and n2 = sin(θ − π/4) with θ being the angle between the shear direction and the x axis, as
shown in Fig. 6. In such a case, the direction of the martensitic transformation is symbolized

ij are zero except T

directly associated with the martensitic transformation. Once T

ij is known, we can obtain

ij = λT

σT
ij according to σT
ij in the x− y plane by substituting σT
C
ij into Eq.2 (see Eq.B.2 in the Appendix B). For the
calculation of the stress/strain ﬁeld, typical values are chosen as: T = 0.01, G = 33 GPa,

ij. Afterwards, we can obtain the explicit expression for

along the y axis. Since the martensitic transformation takes place before the overall yielding

occurs in the glassy matrix, here we take σA = 1 GPa according to our experimental results

(Fig. 3).

Figure 8(a)-(b) display the contour plots of the von Mises stress σv in the vicinity of
a transforming spherical B2 phase for two shear angles (a) θ = 45◦ and (b) θ = 60◦.
From these ﬁgures, one can see clearly that σv is constant inside the crystalline phase but

exhibits strong position dependence in the glassy matrix, as consistent with the Eshelby

theory(Eshelby, 1957). As can be seen, σv is small (generally less than 1 GPa) in the

regions straying away from the direction of the martensitic transformation, such as those

colored in blue, while becomes intensiﬁed in the regions aligning with the direction of the

martensitic transformation, such as those colored in red. This is particularly so for the

high transformation angle θ = 60◦, at which the maximum value of σv could exceed the
macroscopic yield stress of the glassy matrix (∼1.5 GPa) in the directions close to that of
phase transformation (as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 8(b)). This indicates that these

regions are the preferable sites for shear-band initiation in the glassy matrix during the

martensitic transformation. Since the maximum σv always appear in the direction aligning

with the transformation angle θ, the formation of the type II shear bands, as observed in

our experiments (Fig. 5), can be rationalized as a direct result of the stress redistribution

in the glassy matrix during the martensitic transformation of the B2 phases.

Next, we would like to calculate the stress/strain distribution in the BMG composite

after the martensitic transformation of the B2 phases. For a uniaxial compressive stress

(σA < 0) along the y axis, the eﬀective ”transformation” strain or eigenstrain T

ij can be

written as:

ij = (AσA/9K)δij + (BσA/6G)(3ninj − δij)
T

(5)

where A and B are the two coeﬃcients associated with the elastic mismatch between the

martensitic phase and the glassy matrix. Note that the uniaxial loading along the y axis

corresponds to n1 = n3 = 0 and n2 = 1; the ﬁrst term in the right hand side of Eq.5

is for pure dilation while the second term for pure shear. Likewise, for the pure shear

term in Eq.5, the resultant elastic stress/strain ﬁeld can be derived following a very similar

procedure as that used for the transience of the martensitic transformation of the B2 phases;

while for the pure dilation term T

kl = dδkl, where d is the magnitude of the dilatational

strain, an explicit expression for the corresponding stress/strain ﬁeld could be also obtained

(see Eq.C.1). Afterwards, based on the principle of superposition in linear elasticity, one can

obtain the elastic strain/stress ﬁeld and thus the von Mises stress distribution in the presence

of a martensitic phase in the glassy matrix. At the present time, there are no available data

reported for the elastic modulus of the CuZr martensitic phase. However, according to the

measured hardness data(Wu et al., 2010), the elastic modulus of the martensitic phases

should be larger than that of the B2 phases. As a result, this yields the negative values

of A and B, which means that a compressive external strain A < 0 always corresponds to

19

a tensile eﬀective eigenstrain (T > 0), and vice versa. As will be shown in the later text,

this behavior has an important eﬀect on the stability of the particle-glass interface and thus

the ductility of the CuZr BMG composite under diﬀerent loading condition (compression or

tension).

According to Eq.4 the values of A and B are a function of the elastic constant diﬀerence
x [x = (C1 − C)/C, C denotes K or G]. Here, we take the typical values of A and B
at x = 0.25 and 0.50 and calculate the corresponding von Mises stress distribution in the
x − y plane, as shown in Fig. 9 (a) and (b) respectively. In this case, the maximum values
of σv appear close to the martensitic phase and the direction of the maximum von mises

stress is perpendicular to the loading axis, as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 9(a) and (b).

In addition, the variation of x only changes the intensity of σv, but the distribution of σv

remains the same. This behavior indicates that, as the external load continues increasing

after the martensitic transformation, the elastic mismatch between the martensitic phase

and the glassy matrix will cause shear-band initiation in the direction vertical to the loading

axis, which is exactly what we observed in the experiments, that is, the type III shear bands

as seen in Fig. 5.

4.2. Mechanistic mechanism for the strain hardening ability

Compared to monolithic BMGs, one of prominent deformation features of Cu-Zr based

BMG composites is their strain or work hardening ability(Hofmann, 2010; Wu et al., 2010).

According to the prior works(Hofmann, 2010; Pauly et al., 2010b; Wu et al., 2010), the

observed work hardening in the CuZr based BMG composites cannot be solely attributed

to the intrinsic strain hardening of the B2 phases, but also arises from a constraining eﬀect

of the glassy matrix on the martensitic transformation and the subsequent deformation of

the transformed phases.

In theory, this constraint eﬀect, also called Eshelby back stress

eﬀect, increases the elastic energy stored in the whole composite system, which leads to an

increase in the applied stress and thus manifests as strain hardening in the BMG composite.

Now, with the obtained expressions for the various stress/strain ﬁelds, the contribution to

the strain hardening from this constraint eﬀect can be quantitatively analyzed. According

20

martensite phases in the vicinity region of a spherical phase of x − y plane. Two mappings with x = 0.1(a)
and x = 0.2(b) are showed here. The arrows indicated the regions with maximum von Mises stress.

21

to Eshelby’s theory(Eshelby, 1957), the total increase in the elastic energy storage E1 in

the BMG composite during the martensitic transformation, i.e.

for a spherical inclusion

undergoing a pure shear T

ij = T (2ninj − 1)(i, j = 1, 2 and n3 = 0), can be written as:

E1 =

2(7 − 5ν)
15(1 − ν)

G(T )2V + σAT φV

(6)

where V is the volume of the inclusion. Note that the ﬁrst term at the right-hand side of

Eq.6 is the strain energy stored due to the martensitic transformation of the inclusion and

the second term is the strain energy stored due to the interaction of the elastic ﬁeld of the

transforming inclusion and the external stress ﬁeld, i.e. the uniaxial far-ﬁeld stress σA along

the y axis, which can be generally expressed as(cid:82)

here that the elastic energy E1 is instantaneous and vanishes after the phase transformation.

On the other hand, after the phase transformation, the strain energy stored E2 due to the

interaction of the elastic ﬁeld of the inhomogeneity with the external uniaxial stress ﬁeld

is(Weinberger C, 2005):

Note that the negative sign in the above expression makes E2 positive because the coeﬃcient

A and B are both negative.

Assume that the number of the transformed B2 phases is N f , where N is the total

number of the B2 phase per volume in the undeformed sample and f is the accumulated

percentage of transformation. Hence, the number of the B2 phases undergoing the marten-
sitic transformation can be written as N P (1 − f ), where P is the instantaneous probability
for a B2 phase to undergo the martensitic transformation. As a result, the total elastic

energy stored is:

Etotal = N P (1 − f ) ¯E1 + N f E2

(8)

where ¯E1 is the elastic energy E1 averaged over all possible orientations of the B2 phases.

The accumulated fraction of the transformed B2 phases, f = f (y), is assumed to be a

22

single-valued function of the external strain y. As a result of the additional elastic energy

storage (Eq.8), the applied stress has to increase, resulting in strain hardening. The strain

hardening coeﬃcient δ is deﬁned as δ = dσ/dy = d2Etotal/d2
obtain δ = N (E2 − P ¯E1)(d2f /d2
y). From the simple linear-growth model, one infer that
the transformation rate df /dy = (1 − f )/0, i.e., the transformation rate of the B2 phases
be proportional to the volume fraction (1 − f ) of un-transformed B2 phases and 0 denotes
a reference strain. Solving the above equation gives f (y) = 1 − exp(−y/0). Combining
this equation with the expression for δ, we ﬁnally obtain δ = δ0exp(−y/0)with δ0 =
N (P ¯E1 − E2)/2
0. To verify our modeling, we collected the strain hardening coeﬃcients as a
function of the plastic strain from the stress-strain curves, as reported in the literature(Pauly

et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010), for the CuZr-based BMG composites with diﬀerent volume

fractions of B2 phases. As show in Fig. 10, it is evident that our theoretical modeling is in

excellent agreement with the experimental data, which indicates that the strain hardening

ability of the Cu-Zr based metallic glass composites can be attributed to the Eshelby back

stress eﬀect, as proposed in the previous works(Pauly et al., 2010b). Since the volume

fraction of the B2 phases is proportional to N , we can thus infer, the strain hardening

coeﬃcient should increase with the volume fraction of the B2 phases in a linear way, which

is consistent with the previous studies(Song et al., 2013). In addition, the dependence of
the strain hardening coeﬃcient δ0 on the term δ0 = N (P ¯E1 − E2)/2
0 implies that one has
to ensure N P ¯E1 > E2 in order to retain a positive strain hardening coeﬃcient. In other

words, in terms of achieving the strain hardening ability and tensile ductility in the BMG

composites, it is beneﬁcial to reduce the extent of the elastic mismatch (as for a low E2)

and/or to design the orientation of the B2 phases for a high and eﬃcient instantaneous

transformation probability P .

4.3. Stress-aﬀected zones (SAZ) of crystalline phases and their eﬀects on ductility

Based on the experimental results (Fig. 5) and theoretical analyses, it is clear that

there is a stress-aﬀected zone (SAZ) for every B2 phase embedded in the glassy matrix,

within which the martensitic transformation can lead to the formation of type II and III

δ0 = 5.3 × 104 MPa, 0 = 0.017 for Vf = 25% and δ0 = 4.2 × 105 MPa, 0 = 0.008 for Vf = 32%

shear bands. From an experimental viewpoint, the extension of these shear bands could

be used to estimate the SAZ size. Theoretically, we can assume the SAZ to be a cubic

region for simplicity and the side length b of the SAZ can be estimated from the decay of

the constraining stress with the distance r from the center of the B2 phase. Figure 11 (a)

and (b) show the variation of the von-Mises stress with r along the propagation direction of
type II (θ = 60◦) and III shear bands, respectively. As seen in these ﬁgures, the von Mises

stress varies signiﬁcantly in the proximity of the crystalline phase but approaches to the

far ﬁeld stress far away. For type II shear bands, σv reaches the external stress level when
the distance r > 3.5a, which corresponds to b ∼ 2.5a; while for type III shear bands, this
distance can be set as 2.5a, which also corresponds to b ∼ 2.5a. Therefore, we can safely
choose b = 2.5a as a theoretical estimate of the SAZ size, beyond which the back stress

eﬀect caused by the martensitic transformation can be neglected.

The distribution of the SAZs in the glassy matrix could have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on

the deformation stability and ductility of the Cu-Zr based metallic-glass composites. For

a composite with a dilute B2 concentration, the ﬁnal fracture of the composite can take

place along the path of the type I shear band as caused by the external stress. Therefore,

the stability of the type I shear bands determines the overall ductility of the metallic-glass

composite, as in monolithic metallic glasses(Han et al., 2009; Song et al., 2008; Torre et al.,

2010). However, a large population of SAZs could deﬂect the propagation of the type I

shear band, thus delaying the occurrence of shear-banding instability as illustrated in Fig.

3(b) and Fig. 11(c). Since the type I shear band propagates through the regions between

the SAZs, the smaller is the spacing L between two adjacent SAZs the more eﬀectively is

SAZs in shear-band deﬂection. For a homogeneous distribution of the crystalline phases, L

can be estimated as b = 1/ 3(cid:112)Vf /(4πa3/3) − b by taking the composite sample to be a cubic

shape with a unit length, where Vf is the volume fraction of the crystalline phases. From

this expression, one can see that L decreases with the increasing Vf , which indicates that

a higher volume fraction of crystalline phases can lead to a better ductility of the metallic-

glass composite, as consistent with the reported experimental results(Pauly et al., 2009).

However, as Vf increases and the SAZs begin to overlap, L will ﬁnally become zero when

25

Figure 11: Schematic diagram illustrating the stress aﬀected zone (SAZ) due to the stress redistribution of

the MT of B2 phases and the subsequent deformation of martensite phases and their deﬂection on the type

I shear band during the deformation of CuZr based metallic glass composites.

26

Vf reaches a critical value. When this happens, the deﬂection of the type-I shear bands is

no longer the controlling mechanism for the deformation stability of the composite. Other

mechanisms, such as interface debonding, may come into eﬀect. Taking b = 2.5a into the
expression for L, one obtains the critical volume fraction Vf c ≈ 27%.
Interestingly, this
value of Vf c is very close to the percolation threshold (∼30%) as experimentally identiﬁed
for the crystalline phases in the Cu-Zr metallic-glass composites(Pauly et al., 2009).

On the other hand, for a give Vf , L decreases with the decreasing radius of the B2

phases. This implies a size eﬀect of the crystalline phase on the ductility of the metallic-

glass composites. Given a ﬁxed volume fraction, the smaller is the size of the individual

crystalline phase the denser is its spatial distribution. In turn, this leads to more eﬀective

deﬂection of the type-I shear bands and thus better ductility. However, to enhance the

ductility of the metallic-glass composite, it can be envisioned that the size of the crystalline

phases cannot be reduced inﬁnitely because of the ﬁnite thickness of a shear band, which

ranges from 10 nm to 100 nm[5]. When the size of a crystalline phase is comparable to the

thickness of a shear band, it becomes less eﬀective to deﬂect the propagation of the type-I

shear band. Consequently, one may foresee an optimum size for the crystalline phase to

enhance the overall ductility of the metallic-glass composites, the details of which deserve

further theoretical and experimental studies.

4.4. Stability of amorphous/crystalline interface

Finally, we would like to consider the issue of the stability of the interface between the

crystalline phase and the glassy matrix. The debonding of the interface has been observed

during the ﬁnal deformation stage of a Cu-Zr metallic glass composite under tensile load-

ing(Wu et al., 2010). In principle, the crystalline-amorphous interface is considered stable

under a compressive normal stress or a negative hydrostatic pressure (σii < 0) but may

debond under a tensile normal stress or a positive hydrostatic pressure (σii > 0). Now let

us calculate the hydrostatic pressure on the crystalline-amorphous interface caused by the

martensitic transformation. According to the Eshelby theory(Eshelby, 1957), the mechanical

equations, we can roughly estimate the interfacial bonding strength between the crystalline

phases and the amorphous matrix. This can be done by equating the maximum tensile

principle, based on the theoretical framework, we can extract the interfacial bonding strength

if the value of T is exactly known or vice versa.

Following a similar procedure, the hydrostatic pressure acting on the crystalline-amorphous

interface after the martensitic transformation can be derived as p = − 1−2ν
1−ν (KBσA/6G)(3ninj−

ternal x − y − z axis, such that n1 = n3 = 0, n2 = 1. For the case of uniaxial compression
(σA < 0), the the maximum tensile pressure pmax
1−ν KBσA/6G is attained at the points
where the interface intersects the x-axis or z-axis; while the maximum compressive pressure

the case of uniaxial tension, the sign of the above pressures is changed but the magnitude

remains the same. Taking B ∼ 0.1 σA = 1.5 GPa, K = 114 GPa, G = 32 GPa, ν = 0.37,
the estimated maximum tensile pressure is 37 MPa, which is much smaller than that due to

martensitic transformation of B2 phases. Thus, the hydrostatic pressure due to the elastic

mismatch between the martensite phase and the glassy matrix can be reasonably neglected

in the estimation of the interface bonding strength.

5. Summaries and conclusions

In summary, salient conclusions can be drawn below based on our current experimental

and theoretical studies:

(1) Three types of shear bands with distinct morphological characteristics are identiﬁed

in the deformed metallic-glass composites. The type-I shear bands are oriented 45

degrees relative to the loading axis and related to the external stress ﬁeld; while the

type-II and type-III shear bands as seemingly joining or emanating from the crystalline

phases have a diﬀerent orientation. Based on the Eshelby theory, it is shown that the

type-II shear bands result from the stress ﬁeld caused by the martensitic transformation

of the B2 phases, while the type-III shear bands result from the stress ﬁeld caused by

the elastic mismatch induced after the martensitic transformation.

(2) The back stress eﬀect during the martensitic transformation and the elastic misﬁt

eﬀect afterwards act together and increase the elastic energy storage during the defor-

mation of the metallic-glass composite, giving rise to work hardening.

(3) A stress-aﬀected zone (SAZ) around the crystalline phase is deﬁned based on our

stress analysis. The presence of the SAZs rationalizes the phenomenon of the deﬂection

of the type-I shear bands.

(4) The hydrostatic pressure acting on the crystalline-amorphous interface is derived.

Depending on the loading modes, the maximum tensile pressure could be attained at

diﬀerent points along the interface. Interfacial debonding may take place once the tensile

hydrostatic pressure exceeds the interfacial bonding strength.

For T

kl = 3KT

kl = dδkl, σT

kl = 3Kdδkl, taking this into Eq.2 and noticing the equivalence:
K/G = (2/3)(1 + ν)/(1 − 2ν), one could get the constrained stress ﬁeld caused by a pure
dilation of eigenstrain in the matrix:

terface due to MT

In a Cartesian coordinate system, the traceless strain tensor T

ij is in generally expressed

as(Dasgupta et al., 2013):

ij = (2λn + λk)ninj + (2λk + λn)kikj − (λn + λk)δij
T

(C.1)

where λn, λm, λk, are the eigenvalues of the strain tensor or the three principal strains with
the principal axes aligning along the unit vectors n⊥m⊥k. Thus,

T
ijgi = T

T
ijgigj = T

ij(xi/r) = [(2λn + λk)((n) (cid:5) r)nj + (λn + 2λk)((k) (cid:5) r)kj − (λn + λk)xj]/r
(C.2)
ij(xixj/r2) = [(2λn + λk)((n) (cid:5) r)2 + (λn + 2λk)((k) (cid:5) r)2 − (λn + λk)r2]/r2 (C.3)

When the m aligns along the direction of r, n (cid:5) r = 0, k (cid:5) r = 0, T

ijgigj takes the
maximum negative value of −(λn + λk), thus the pressure takes the maximum positive value
max = K(λn +λk)(1−2ν)/(1−ν). For the λn > λk > 0 > λm = −(λn +λk), the shear strain
pT
max = KT (1+ξ)(1−2ν)/(1−ν)
size T is deﬁned as T = (1−3)/2 = (2λn+λk)/2, we have pT
, where ξ = λn/(2λn + λk). When the n aligns to the vector r, n (cid:5) r = 1, k (cid:5) r = 0, T
ijgigj
takes the maximum positive value of λn. Thus, the pressure takes the maximum negative

value pC

max = −KT (1 − ψ)(1 − 2ν)/(1 − ν) , where ψ = λk/(2λn + λk).
