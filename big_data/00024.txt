Abstract

A light meta-stable dark photon decaying into collimated electron/positron pair can fake a photon,

either converted or unconverted, at the LHC. The detailed object identiﬁcation relies on the speciﬁcs of

the detector and strategies for the reconstruction. We study the fake rate based on the ATLAS(CMS)

detector geometry and show that it can be O(1) with a generic choice of parameters. Especially, the

probability of being registered as a photon is angular dependent. If the dark photon is the product of

a heavy resonance decay, e.g. the recent hint of 750 GeV at the LHC, such detector eﬀects can induce

bias when determine the spin of the resonance. If the decay products from the heavy resonance are

one photon and one dark photon, which has a large probability to fake a diphoton event, the resonance

is allowed to be a vector. Due to the diﬀerence in detector, the cross sections measured in ATLAS and

CMS do not necessarily match. In addition to the 750 GeV excess, the issue studied here is relevant

also for any future new physics searches with photon(s) in the ﬁnal state. We discuss possible ways

of distinguishing dark photon decay and real photon in the future.

INTRODUCTION

The second run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at 13 TeV collision energy has started.

Within several months of running, a small amount of data has already been collected on ATLAS
(3.2 fb−1) and CMS (2.6 fb−1). Recently, both groups have reported an excess at around 750
GeV in the diphoton channel. The local signiﬁcance is 3.6 (3.9) σ for narrow (large) width

approximation in ATLAS [1] and 2.6 σ for narrow width in CMS [2].

Many scenarios have been proposed to explain the diphoton excess, and the most straight-

forward explanation is to introduce a new scalar ﬁeld (real or pseudo), which couples to two

are several ways to produce the 750 GeV particle at the LHC. For the QCD initiated process,

the resonance can be produced through couplings to gluons or quarks. In order to generate

a large enough production cross section times the branching ratio while satisfying constraints

from other existing searches, we usually need the charged mediator to either carry a mass (mc)

not heavier than few hundreds of GeV, or have a large ﬂavor number NF [3]. Besides this, the

coupling between the scalar resonance and the mediator also needs to be very large [4].

On the other hand, one can directly produce the scalar resonance by a photon-photon

scattering [5–7] or a vector boson fusion (VBF) process [8]. It is also possible that the resonance

is given by a diﬀerent kinematic structure with more than two particles in the ﬁnal states [9–12].

However, as indicated in both ATLAS and CMS results, no additional energetic objects are

observed in the signal bin verse the bins beside to it. Although the current statistics are not

large enough to make a deﬁnitive conclusion, these scenarios seem to be disfavored.

One particularly interesting possibility is to fake the photon signature by exotic hidden sector

decays. This possibility has been discussed in several places (e.g., [13, 14]), but mostly focused

on the multiple collimated photons being misidentiﬁed as a single photon. It is shown in several

works [3, 4] that making a highly boosted (so the two collimated photons are too close to be

2

resolved) hidden scalar decay into two SM photons within the detector is challenging, and the

charged particles that are introduced to decay the hidden scalar into SM photons can be highly

constrained.

Another way of faking the photon signal, which we explore in this work, is through a displaced

decay into charge leptons. If the light hidden sector particles from a heavy resonance decay

generate two collimated electron/positron pairs at a displaced distance, such objects have a

good chance to fail the lepton tagging and be identiﬁed as photons at the LHC. For example,

when a real photon interacts with materials and converts into an electron/positron pair, the

photon gives the same ﬁnal state particles as from the hidden sector decay. In this paper, we
focus on a particular scenario with displaced dark photon decays γ(cid:48)
ideas about the photon faking are discussed in [3]. Recently, the possibility of dark photon

→ e+e−. Some preliminary

faking converted photon have been considered brieﬂy in Ref. [15]. By including more details

of the photon triggering and detector geometry, we show the decay can also fake unconverted

photon in the same parameter region, and it is important to include both cases in the study. We

also discuss how the diﬀerent decay positions in the detector may aﬀect the object identiﬁcation.

More interestingly, as we will show, due to the subtle object identiﬁcation algorithm in

the detector, the angular distribution of the fake photon signal depends on the dark photon

lifetime. Studying the angular distribution, e.g. for the 750 GeV excess, is the most common

way to determine the spin of the resonance. However, the detector eﬀects can be induced in

our scenario and introduce bias in such analysis.

In Sec.

II, we discuss the details on photon identiﬁcation and show how a dark photon

decaying at diﬀerent part of the detector can fake a photon, either converted or unconverted.

In Sec. III, we classify the dark photon decay identiﬁcation into four categories and study the

probability of each category for generic choices of parameters. Also we compare the kinematics

of electron/positron from a dark photon decay to that from a photon conversion and show they

can be similar to each other. In Sec. IV, we study possible models which can explain the 750

GeV excess. We show both scalar and vector resonances are allowed if dark photons are involved

in ﬁnal states. In Sec. V, we carry out a detailed study on dark photon parameter space and

3

show that a generic choice of parameters, i.e. dark photon mass and mixing parameter, can

easily explain the 750 GeV excess. We also show the distortion of angular distributions after

taking into account of the detector eﬀects. Several new physics searches, such as lepton jet

searches and mono-photon search, may be applied to constrain our parameter space. We ﬁnd

our scenario can be easily consistent with these searches. At last in Sec. VI, we summarize and

discuss the possible ways to distinguish our scenario from the conventional ones.

II. PHOTON SELECTION CRITERIA

As discussed previously, when a highly-boosted light meta-stable particle decays to a colli-

mated electron/positron pair in the earlier part of the tracker, since the particle content of the

ﬁnal state is the same as the one produced from a converted photon, there is a good chance for

the signal to be identiﬁed as a photon, and we will discuss the criteria on photon identiﬁcation

in this section. We note that there can be several diﬀerences between the fake and real con-

verted photons. First, the two leptons from a dark photon decay can have a diﬀerent energy

distribution to the one from a photon conversion. Moreover, the detailed location of photon

conversion should follow the distribution of the material, while the dark photon decay is not

bonded to this. To observe the diﬀerences, we need either a larger number of signal events, or
a ﬁt of the converted e+e− kinematics from the collaborations, neither of which is applicable at
this point. However, the future measurements can be performed and help to identify the fake

photon signal, which we will discuss further in latter sections.

Whether the dark photon decay is identiﬁed as a photon, and whether it fakes a con-

verted or unconverted photon all depend on the decay location and the angle between the

electron/positron in the ﬁnal state. Taking these into account, we investigate the possibility of

obtaining a sizable photon faking probability that satisﬁes existing bounds on the various dis-

placed signals. Our discussion will be mainly based on the details of ATLAS detector [16, 17].

The tracker in CMS has a similar geometry to the one of ATLAS, but the angular resolution

of the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) in the (η, φ) direction is worse in distinguishing
the columnated e+e− from a single photon. Together with the lower integrated luminosity,

4

scenarios that can explain the excess at ATLAS can be straightly applied to the CMS. We

discuss more details of the CMS detector later.

A converted photon is a cluster of energy deposition in the ECAL associated with one or two

tracks which appear in the middle of tracker. More precisely, the reconstructed track should

start after the 1st layer of the tracker, which is about 34 mm away from the central axis of the

detector in the barrel region. The number of tracks can be either 1 or 2 depending on whether

the photon conversion is symmetric or asymmetric. Furthermore, in order to seed the track,

there needs to be at least 3 space points in either Pixel or Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) 1.

Thus any electron/positron appears after the 3rd-to-the-last layer of the SCT (it is about 371

mm away from the central axis in the barrel region) will not leave a reconstructible track. We

emphasize that a converted photon cannot have a track which registers a hit at the ﬁrst layer of

Pixel in the tracker. This is because the conversion can only happen in places with materials.

Thus for a meta-stable particle, if its decay happens between the 1st layer of Pixel and the

3rd-to-the-last layer of SCT, it will be identiﬁed as a converted photon.

It is a little bit subtle if the meta-stable particle decays after the 3rd-to-the-last layer of the

SCT. If the decay happens before the 1st layer of the ECAL, which is about 1500 mm away,

there are no tracks associated to the energy deposition in the ECAL. What kind of object

will the decay signal be identiﬁed further depends on the separation between electron/position

when they hit the ECAL.

The ﬁrst layer of the ECAL in ATLAS has extremely good resolution on pseudo-rapidity

η, ∆η ∼ O(10−3). If the η separation of energy deposition from electron/position cannot be

resolved, such an event will be identiﬁed as a normal photon. If the separation can be resolved,

the signal structure is similar to the one from a neutral pion decaying into 2 photons. Such

an object will not be identiﬁed as a single photon. If the separation is very large, so that the

energy deposition is grouped as 2 clusters in the ECAL, the ﬁnal state is identiﬁed as 2 photons

reconstructed once they are seeded. This will introduce a bias which enlarges the probability of identifying
our meta-stable particle decay as a converted photon instead of a normal photon, as discussed in later context.

5

close to each other. The last possibility is very unlikely to happen in our scenario since we

assume the meta-stable particle is very light and thus highly boosted, so we will not consider

this possibility in the later discussion.

The precise angular cut at the ﬁrst layer of the ECAL, which determines if the signal is a

single photon or not is complicated and η-dependent. In order to proceed, we make a rather

conservative assumption to simplify the calculation by requiring the separation ∆x in length

in the ﬁrst layer of the ECAL to be within the average width of the strip cells (∆x < 4.7 mm).

The bound is similar to the one discussed in [4], which uses the argument that a π0 with 65 GeV

energy can be distinguished from a photon in Higgs searches. There is one subtle diﬀerence,

however, between the two assumptions. The π0 decays promptly in the detector, while our

meta-stable particle needs to decay after 3rd-to-the-last layer of SCT. The spatial separation

from the hidden particle particle decay is smaller than that of the π0 decay if they share the

same opening angle.

In the CMS detector, angular resolution of the lead tungstate crystals in the ECAL is

∆η ∼ O(10−2), and a dark photon decay that passes the angular cut at ATLAS can also look

like a single photon in the CMS. To identify the converted photon, the Converted Safe Electron

Veto (CSEV) used in the CMS also removes tracks with a hit in the innermost tracker layers

[18]. The ﬁrst layer is about 44 mm away from the beam pipe, which is similar to the 34 mm

in the ATLAS setup for our purpose. The crystal calorimeter takes signals up to 1.79 m, which

is not too far from the requirement at ATLAS of having the ECAL signal before 1.5 m. Thus

the faking rate for a meta-stable dark photon decay can be comparable to each other in two

experiments, with only mild diﬀerences.

At last, let us discuss more details about the possibility that dark photon decays either

before the tracker or after the 1st layer of the ECAL. If the decay happens before the tracker,

the object will not be identiﬁed as a converted photon since the reconstructed tracks have hits

on the 1st layer of Pixel. In this case, search of the prompt lepton jets [19] can be useful in

constraining the scenario, as we will study in Sec. V. If the decay happens after the 1st layer

of the ECAL (1590 < r mm in ATLAS), there is a large chance that such decay will not be

6

constructed as a well deﬁned object. In this case, since the search of monophoton in ATLAS [20]

deﬁnes the MET to be the imbalance of the total momentum of the well constructed objects,

the resonance decay into two dark photons – with one has later decay inside the ECAL and one

inside the tracker – may be considered as a monophoton signal. We study the bound in Sec. V

under this conservative assumption. Further, there are specially designed searches if the decay

happens inside the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL, > 1970 mm in ATLAS) for example displaced

lepton signals at the HCAL can be applied [21, 22]. However, these searches only constrain the

8 TeV production to be at the pb level and do not set useful bounds to the 750 GeV signal.

III. OBJECT IDENTIFICATION SUMMARY

Here we summarize the object identiﬁcation criteria used in this work. As we discussed

above, whether the dark photon decay is identiﬁed as a photon, especially whether it is a

converted or unconverted photon both highly rely on the details of the detector. A precise

simulation on the detector response is beyond the scope of this paper. Here we carry out

a simpliﬁed procedure to estimate how the lifetime of meta-stable particles aﬀect the object

identiﬁcation.

We classify the meta-stable particle decay into four regions:

Before Tracker: If the decay happens before the ﬁrst layer of the tracker, i.e. with a

distance ∼< 34 mm in ATLAS, the electron/positron can be identiﬁed, and the signal is not

identiﬁed as a photon. The non-isolated leptons from a highly boosted light particle decay
(with a boost factor ∼ O(103)) can be studied in the lepton-jet search, and we will show in
Sec. V how the existing search constrains the parameter space.

Converted γ Region: If the decay happens within tracker and can leave at least three

space points in either pixel or SCT, we identify such decay as a converted photon. The details

on ATLAS detector is taken from [23]. We emphasize that this is an oversimpliﬁed criteria for

identifying converted photons, and having at least three space points in Pixel or the SCT is

only a minimal requirement to seed a track. In a more complete search, there can be additional

procedures on the track reconstruction.

7

Unconverted γ Region: If the decay happens before the ECAL and after the tracker

region so that there are no more than 3 layer of the SCT to be available to reconstruct the

track, we identify the decay signal to be an unconverted photon. This is under the assumption

that the open angle between electron/position from the meta-stable particle decay is too small

to be resolved as 2 photons in the ECAL. We will see in the later discussion that the angular

cut can be satisﬁed in the model we are interested in.

ECAL & after: If the decay happens within or after the ECAL, we do not identify such

an object as a photon. What it will be identiﬁed depends on where the decay happens. It is

possible that such a late decay of dark photons will be treated as missing energy. If one of

the decay products from the heavy resonance is identiﬁed as a photon, while the other one is

registered as MET, the monophoton search can be used to constrain the parameter space. We

will study the constraint in Sec. V.

In our discussion we focus on the model with 2me < m(cid:48)

γ < 2mµ, where a dark photon

probability of having dark photons with diﬀerent lifetimes decay in the four regions discussed
above. The plot assumes the dark photon, which carries a mass mγ(cid:48) ∼ 100 MeV, is generated
from the decay of a 750 GeV scalar resonance produced by the gluon fusion.
If the heavy
resonance is produced by q− ¯q scattering, it may have a diﬀerent boost along the beam direction
due to diﬀerent parton distribution functions of q ¯q and gluon. This can aﬀect the angular

distribution of the ﬁnal states in the lab frame, and detector eﬀects can cause a subtlety. We

study both cases and ﬁnd a negligible diﬀerence between the two scenarios.

This result has already taken into consideration of the ATLAS detector geometry at diﬀerent

η-angle.

In principle, one can study whether there are fake photons from the dark photon

decays by calculating the ratio of the numbers of the converted versus unconverted photons.

The current statistics is not good enough to draw any conclusion on this property yet. However,

even in the dark photon case, there is a generic choice of decay lifetime where the probability

of being identiﬁed as a converted photon is comparable to that of a unconverted photon, which

is similar to what happens as a real photon. In this case, one cannot easily distinguish whether

simulation. Right: Comparison of energy ratios between the hard and soft lepton from the the SM

the object identiﬁed as a photon is really a photon or from dark photon decay.

One may suggest to distinguish converted photon and light dark photon decay by comparing
the energy ratio between e+e−. However we show in the right panel of Fig. 1, if the dark
photon from the 750 GeV heavy resonance decay is dominantly in transverse modes2, the
asymmetry of the two leptons from γ(cid:48)
→ e+e− is similar to that in the converted photon
process γ + A → e+e− + Z, where A and Z stand for the incoming and out going states of the
target. This is because the electron from a transversely produced dark photon decay tends to
be parallel or anti-parallel to the dark photon spin, boosting γ(cid:48) into the lab frame makes one

2 This is the case if the dark photon couples to the 750 GeV heavy resonance through a triangle-loop induced
by heavy fermions. The longitudinal mode is suppressed by the small Yukawa coupling between dark higgs
and heavy charged particle running in the loop.

In the left panel of Fig. 2, we show the eﬃciency of a dark photon decay in the unconverted
photon region that passes the open angle cut, assuming η(γ(cid:48)) = 0 for simplicity. The cut
requires the e+e− pair that fakes a normal photon to hit the ﬁrst layer of the ATLAS ECAL
within a separation4 ∆x < 4.7 mm in the η-direction, so the signal can be identiﬁed as a single

photon. This is a rather conservative assumption comparing to the estimation using boosted
pions from the Higgs decay measurement [4]. The resulting probability is higher for a γ(cid:48) with a
larger boost (smaller mγ(cid:48)) or a longer decay length. Having the decay closer to the ECAL allows
a larger separation between e+e−. When estimating the acceptance of this cut, we assume dark
photons are produced in the transverse mode. After boosting the open angle to the lab-frame,

we calculate the acceptance as a function of the decay position.

In the right panel of Fig. 2, we show the probability of a dark photon decay being identiﬁed

as a photon in the ATLAS detector. The estimation is based on the probability of dark

photon decaying in the converted and unconverted photon regions (solid curves). The dash-

dotted curves in Fig. 2 contain the angular cut discussed above. As we can see in the plot,

the diﬀerence between the probability with (solid curve) and without (dot-dashed curve) the

angular cut is not signiﬁcant. This is because an O(100) MeV dark photon is highly boosted

from the decay of a 750 GeV resonance.

IV. MODELS

Before we get into a more detailed discussion of detector simulation, let us ﬁrst consider

several possibilities from model building point of view. First, it is non-trivial to explain the

d cos θ ∝ (1 + cos θ2) in the
center-of-mass frame, where θ is the open angle between e− and the spin direction. Here we assume the
resonance mass (cid:29) mγ(cid:48) (cid:29) me, and the obtained energy ratio distribution is dσ
1+x2 − 1)/(1 + x)2, with
x ≡ ESoft/EHard in the lab frame.
4 This is the average width of a strip cell. The precise number is angular dependent due to detector details,
and we only take one ﬁxed number in our analysis to simplify the calculation. The result from this estimation
should only be diﬀerent from the real answer by a factor of O(1).

diphoton resonance if one requires a sizable decays branching ratio to SM photons. One or more

light electrically charged particles are usually needed, and they can be tightly constrained by

experimental searches. If instead the 750 GeV resonance generates the signal by ﬁrst decaying

into hidden sector scalars that further decay into SM photons, the ultraviolet (UV) completion

of the signal process may be easily achieved, since the resonance can couple much stronger

to the hidden sector with much looser experimental constraints. However, such models have

generic challenges on decaying the hidden sector scalar inside the detector. In order to make

photons from hidden scalar decay collimated enough to be tagged as a single photon, the mass
of the hidden particle needs to be of O(100) MeV scale [4]. For example, if the light particle is a

[24].

This challenge motivates the study of faking a photon signal by a displaced dark photon

As is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1, the dark photon, consistent with constraints from

dark photon searches [25], can easily fake a photon in the collider detector. This opens many

possibilities from model building point of view.

In the rest of the section, we discuss some

interesting ways for resonance production and decay when dark photons are involved. As we

will show, in order to achieve the required signal rate, the UV model suﬀers much weaker

constraints than models with SM photons in the ﬁnal states.

(2)

Such operators can be introduced by integrating out particles charged under a dark U(1)(cid:48), where
gd is the U(1)(cid:48) gauge coupling. Φ can either be a real or a pseudo scalar. It is also possible that
one of the decay products is a SM photon, so the possible decay channels are

Φ(750) → γ(cid:48)γ(cid:48),

Φ(750) → γγ(cid:48).

(3)

The latter decay, however, may require the existence of a light SM charged mediator. Actually,

in this case, there should be a γγ mode as well. This can be parametrically suppressed by
choosing e/gd < 1. But then the γ(cid:48)γ mode is also suppressed relative to the γ(cid:48)γ(cid:48) mode.

5 The meta-stable particle may also be a light scalar coupling to leptons. However, such scenarios suﬀer
stringent constraints either from having a light SU(2)L doublet or sizable mixing to Higgs. It is diﬃcult to
have the highly boosted decay into e+e− to happen before the ECAL while satisfying the constraints.

12

A scalar resonance can be produced through the gluon fusion, q− ¯q scattering or electroweak
vector boson fusion (VBF). For the VBF process, the signal usually come with forward jets and

is relatively easy to be tagged on. Further, if the scalar can directly couple to W or Z bosons at

tree level, it has to be a condensed ﬁeld that charged under the SM electroweak gauge groups.

Such a scenario is highly constrained, and it is hard to achieve a large enough (dark-) photon

branching ratio through loop diagrams. Thus we do not consider the VBF production in the

rest of the discussion.

If the heavy resonance couples to gluons through loop diagrams, its eﬀective coupling can

be characterized as

depending on whether Φ is a real or pseudo-real scalar boson. The gluon initiated process can

better accommodate the null result at the 8 TeV search [3, 4, 26]. We will assume the diphoton

rate to be 5 fb at 13 TeV. To obtain a 20 fb Φ(750) production with Br(Φ → 2γ(cid:48)) = 0.25, we
need a SM colored mediator carrying a mass M1,2 (cid:39) 3 TeV, and a U(1)(cid:48) charged mediator with
mass M(cid:48)

coupling of the mediator.
The Φ can also couple to q− ¯q, e.g. by sharing the same SU (2)L and U(1)Y charges as Higgs
boson. If Φ is inert, so it does not condense or mix with SM Higgs, the Higgs measurement

However, one has to tune the ﬂavor structure in order to obtain a large enough production. It

is also more challenging to hide the diphoton resonance searches at Run 1 by ATLAS and CMS
[27, 28]. From rescaling the parton luminosity, Run 1 result of a q − ¯q initiated process into
diphoton has a sensitivity (cid:39) 40% better than the Run 2 result [3]. This makes it more diﬃcult
to explain the diphoton signal while satisfying the Run 1 constraint. If one assumes universal

B. Spin-1 resonance

If we allow dark photon in the ﬁnal states, it is also possible for the heavy resonance being

a vector boson, i.e. V µ

H as a gauge boson of a condensed U(1)H. Landau-Yang theorem forbids
the massive vector decaying to two photons. It is possible that the heavy vector decays to two

dark photons because they are not massless. However, the decay rate are expected to be highly

suppressed due to the small mass of dark photon. On the other hand, it is possible that the

heavy vector decays to one SM photon and one dark photon,

V (750) → γγ(cid:48).

(6)

In this case, the two particles in the ﬁnal states are not identical, thus no more suppression is

applied to this decay channel. The decay of the heavy vector boson can be characterized by

eﬀective operators, for example,

(7)

gd and gH are γ(cid:48) and VH gauge couplings of the heavy mediator running in the loop6. Having
a SM photon in the ﬁnal state requires the existence of SM charged mediators. Since VH is a

color singlet, it cannot be produced through gluon fusion due to Landau-Yang theorem. For a

of VH at 13 TeV. In order to obtain a sizable branching ratio, we need the mass of SM charged

q − ¯q production of VH, the gauge coupling as large as ∼ 10−2 can give an O(10) fb production
mediator to be ˜M ∼ √gd gHNF × 220 GeV, where NF is the number of ﬂavors running in the

loop.

6 The second operator is not gauge invariant under U(1)H . It takes the longitudinal component of the heavy
resonance. Thus this operator is proportional to the heavy resonance mass and eﬀectively a dimension 7
operator.

14

Besides to loop-induced decay into (dark) photons, if the dark higgs which gives the mass to

dark photon is also charged under U(1)H, VH can decay into the dark higgs and the longitudinal

mode of dark photon. Generically, the dark higgs has a mass close to dark photon, thus it is

kinematically allowed for this dark higgs to decay into two dark photons, and this decay can

happen at detector scale. When the decay of the dark higgs happens inside the region of

the unconverted photon identiﬁcation, i.e. Region III from Sec. III, there is a chance that

such process can fake a SM photon. Since the typical separation between the four leptons is

∆R ∼ mφd/2mVH ∼ 10−4 for mφd = O(100) MeV, the four leptons from the decay can be

within the angular resolution of the ECAL. The beneﬁt of this scenario is that the heavy vector

resonance decays through a marginal operator and no light charged particles at O(100) GeV

needs to be introduced to UV complete an irrelevant operator. However, the detector study

of such scenario is more complicated, and we leave the detailed study of the reconstruction

eﬃciency for future work.

C. Resonance as a heavy bound state

As we have seen in the previous discussion. If the 750 GeV heavy resonance decays through

loop-induced irrelevant operators, a low suppression scale is usually needed in order to achieve

sizable branching ratio to signal channel. Another interesting possibility is that the 750 GeV

heavy resonance is actually a bound state formed by a pair of new particles. If the new particle

has a strong coupling to light dark photon, there is a high probability that the bound state is

produced instead of two free particles 7. The bound state can be either a scalar or a vector.

If it is a scalar, the annihilation decay is dominantly by a pair of the force mediator, i.e. dark

photon. The decay width of the bound state can be estimated as

fermions.

15

where αγ(cid:48) is the dark photon coupling constant and MB = 750 GeV is the bound state mass.

Three powers of αX in Eq. (8) comes from the wavefunction suppression in the bound state. It

appears in all annihilation decay channels. Thus dark photon pair decay channel is preferred

for scalar resonance due to strong coupling of the dark photon. On the other hand, if the
resonance is a vector state, the γ + γ(cid:48) ﬁnal state is more preferred.

When the heavy resonance is a vector ﬁeld, one interesting possibility is that the decay

V (750) → 3γ(cid:48) is comparable to the γγ(cid:48) channel. Although the Landau-Yang theorem forbids the

vector to decay into two SM photons, and the two dark photon channel is highly suppressed by a

power law of mγ(cid:48) over the resonance mass, there is nothing preventing the heavy resonance from

decaying into three dark photons (see also [31]). When the dark photon has a much stronger
coupling than that of normal photon, the 3γ(cid:48) channel may have a similar decay branching
ratio to γγ(cid:48), and the search of three photon resonance can be important. For example, as we
discussed previously, the heavy resonance may be a vector bound state formed by the dark
photon exchange. In this case, dark photon needs to have a large coupling, such as αγ(cid:48) ∼ 0.3,
in order to have a sizable probability to form a bound state at the LHC. If both decay processes
are allowed, the decay branching ratios into 3γ(cid:48) and γγ(cid:48) are compatible,

and the dark photons in the ﬁnal states will further decay into collimated e+e− that can fake
the SM photons. Searching for a resonance in 3-photon ﬁnal states may provide an interesting

probe to this possibility. On the other hand, the boost factor of dark photon from 3-body decay

is smaller than that from 2-body decay. Thus the dark photon will have a shorter decay length

in the lab frame. This may change the eﬃciency of being identiﬁed as a photon, and a detailed

simulation is necessary to take into account the detector eﬀects.

V. SIMULATION RESULTS

Let us ﬁrst focus on the scenario where the 750 GeV resonance is a scalar boson. There

is a generic choice of parameter space, i.e. (mγ(cid:48), ), for a dark photon to fake a SM photon

16

with a probability ∼> 80%. To estimate the probability, we ﬁrst simulate a parton-level process
gg → Φ(750) → 2γ(cid:48) using MadGraph5.2 [32] and the eﬀective coupling in Eq. (2) coded

using FeynRules 2.3 [33]. We carrt out our analysis at parton level and we do not expect

the conclusion will change much after detailed detector simulations are included. We apply

kinematic cuts pT (γ(cid:48)) > 300 GeV (0.4 mγγ taken in [1]), |η(γ(cid:48))| < 2.37 in event selections. For

each dark photon, we take its (Eγ(cid:48), ηγ(cid:48)) and calculate the corresponding decay probability in

each photon identiﬁcation region, as described in Sec. III. We carry out similar analysis for

with 5 fb diphoton signal at 13 TeV in ATLAS. As expected, changing kinetic mixing aﬀects

the event selection acceptance, and the total production cross section needs to be modiﬁed

accordingly in order to give 5 fb signal rate in diphoton channel. Such a signal rate can be

easily obtained by a generic choice of the parameter space.

If the dark photon decays after the ECAL, there is a good chance for the signals to be either

un-constructible (gives missing energy) or identiﬁed as displaced lepton-jets [22]. As we discuss

in Sec. II, searches of displaced lepton-jets does not yet provide relevant constraints. In the

monophoton search [20], the MET is deﬁned as the imbalance of the total pT of constructed

objects. If we take the conservative assumption by identifying the decays after the ﬁrst layer

of the ECAL to be contributions to MET, monophoton search can be applied to constrain the

parameter space [20, 35]. In Fig. 3, the shaded region on the top left is given by the 90% CL

exclusion from monophoton seach at the 8 TeV search in [20]. Here we adapt cuts used in
the ATLAS search, i.e. requiring one of the dark photons to have pT > 150 GeV, |η| < 1.37
and decays inside the photon identiﬁcation region, while the other photon decays after the ﬁrst

layer of the ECAL. The bounds are barely relevant for the parameter space which gives 5 fb

signal rate in diphoton channel.

conservatively by assuming the highly collimated e+e− from the light γ(cid:48) decays cannot be reconstructed
if the decay happens after the ﬁrst layer of the ECAL (∼< 1590 mm). Since the MET in [20] is deﬁned

as the imbalance of the total pT of the constructed objects, we treat such displaced decay as missing

energy. When the decay happens before Pixel (∼< 34 mm), the highly collimated lepton pairs are

identiﬁed as lepton jets. The rescaling of the resonance production between 13/8 TeV is based on the

collimated e+e− from the dark photon decay can be identiﬁed as a lepton-jet. ATLAS carries
out a search on prompt lepton-jet pair [19]. This search can be applied to constrain our scenario

since it is possible that both dark photon decay before getting into the tracker, especially when

the mixing  is large. We show the existing bound on the cross section in the shaded region at
the right side of Fig. 3. Lepton-jets are required to have pT > 5 GeV, |η| < 2.5, and we apply
a reconstruction factor 0.6 for each of the jet which is comparable to the value used in [19]. As

we see, the bound is only relevant when the mixing is large and is not useful to constrain most

It is interesting to study the angular distribution of the fake photons. When the decay length

in the lab frame is comparable to the detector size, the geometry of the tracker and ECAL aﬀects

the photon faking probability and introduces detector eﬀects to the angular distribution of the
signals. The current diphoton analysis in ATLAS imposes hard pγ

T cuts in the event selections,
which remove the decays close to the beam direction. However, a wider range of the angular

distribution is necessary for studying the spin of the heavy resonance, and it is useful to relax
the pγ
milder way by requiring pγ

T cut. When studying the angular distribution in Fig. 4 and 5, we impose the pT cut in a

T > 50 GeV for both photons.

In Fig. 4 and 5, we take the events which are registered as diphoton under the relaxed pT

cuts, we boost the events back to the rest frame of the heavy resonance and study the angular

distribution of the decay. For both the scalar and vector resonances, more forward fake photon

will be accepted if the dark photon has a longer decay length. This is because a larger distance

between the interaction point and the detector means a larger probability for a dark photon

faking a photon. The angular distribution is the way to determine the spin of a particle. In

our scenario, the detector eﬀect can easily introduce a bias to the ﬁnal state distribution which

could cause confusion/mistake when study the spin of a heavy resonance without this subtlety

bearing in mind. Further, as shown in Fig. 5, angular distribution of various categories of

photon identiﬁcation can be diﬀerent. This may provide a unique way to distinguish a real

photon from the displaced dark photon decay.

VI. DISCUSSION

Object identiﬁcation in high energy collider is subtle. In this paper, we study the possibility
of faking photon signals at the LHC using displaced decays of dark photon into e+e−. The
process provides appealing alternatives in explaining the possible diphoton excess in both the

ATLAS and CMS searches [1, 2]. Under a generic choice of parameters, dark photons from

the 750 GeV resonance decay have a large chance to be identiﬁed as SM photons in detectors.

Since dark photon channel can easily dominate the resonance decay mediated by a barely

as our benchmark.

constrained dark sector, the scenario helps to reconcile the tension between having a sizable

rate for diphoton events and satisfying constraints on the light and SM charged mediators.

When a dark photon decays at diﬀerent region of the detector, it will be identiﬁed as diﬀerent

object according to the object reconstruction strategies. This introduces a detector structure

dependence into object identiﬁcation. More explicitly, given a ﬁxed decay distance, a dark

photon propagating along diﬀerent angular direction may decay at diﬀerent part of the detector,

e.g. before the tracker, within the tracker, within the ECAL or outside the ECAL. Thus

this dark photon decay can be identiﬁed as diﬀerent object, such as lepton jet, converted

photon, unconverted photon, et. al.. The detector structure induced angular dependence will

aﬀect event selection and give a angular dependent acceptance. This can introduce a bias

on the angular distribution study, for example when studying the spin of a resonance. More

interestingly, diﬀerent detectors, i.e. ATLAS and CMS, have diﬀerent internal structures.

Since the event selection has a strong dependence on detector details, ATLAS and CMS may

have diﬀerent probabilities for the dark photon faking a photon. Thus without unfolding the

detector eﬀects, ATLAS and CMS do not necessarily agree with each other. Comparing signal

cross section or angular distribution between these two experiments may provide a useful and

benchmark.

novel handle to distinguish our scenario from conventional ones.

A dark photon which decays within the tracker can fake a real photon. However, that implies

a non-negligible probability for the decay to be before or after the tracker. If it decays before

the tracker, such an object may be identiﬁed as a lepton-jet. Further if the decay happens after

the ECAL, it can be identiﬁed as diﬀerent objects depending on the detailed decay location.

If the decay happens inside the HCAL, it may be identiﬁed as a jet with no electromagnetic

(EM) energy. Such exotic objects has already been covered in some searches. However an

optimization, such as triggering on one hard photon and one jet with no EM energy, can be

If it decays in the muon chamber, another specialized

search can be imposed to cover such a scenario. Afterall, if the 750 GeV diphoton excess comes

from the displaced dark photon decay, one expects excesses in searches with exotic objects as

well in the future.

We are motivated by the possibility of dark photon decay can account for the 750 GeV excess.

At the same, our study really highlights the possibility of dark photon decay can fake photon.

Therefore, the lesson one can draw here has much broader implication.

In principle, dark

photon can provide alternative interpretations of many searches of new physics with photon(s)

in the ﬁnal state. In addition, dedicated dark photon searches should also take into account

the possibility that dark photon can have longer life time and be “mistagged” as a photon. It

is important to develop more sophisticated strategies to distinguish them eﬃciently.
