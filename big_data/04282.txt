ABSTRACT
Long-lived radioactive nuclei play an important role as nucleo-cosmochronometers and
as cosmic tracers of nucleosynthetic source activity. In particular nuclei in the actinide
region like thorium, uranium, and plutonium can testify to the enrichment of an en-
vironment by the still enigmatic astrophysical sources that are responsible for the
production of neutron-rich nuclei by the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process).
Supernovae and merging neutron-star (NS) or NS-black hole binaries are considered
as most likely sources of the r-nuclei. But arguments in favour of one or the other or
both are indirect and make use of assumptions; they are based on theoretical mod-
els with remaining simpliﬁcations and shortcomings. An unambiguous observational
determination of a production event is still missing. In order to facilitate searches
in this direction, e.g. by looking for radioactive tracers in stellar envelopes, the in-
terstellar medium or terrestrial reservoirs, we provide improved theoretical estimates
and corresponding uncertainty ranges for the actinide production (232Th, 235,236,238U,
237Np, 244Pu, and 247Cm) in neutrino-driven winds of core-collapse supernovae. Since
state-of-the-art supernova models do not yield r-process viable conditions —but still
lack, for example, the eﬀects of strong magnetic ﬁelds— we base our investigation on a
simple analytical, Newtonian, adiabatic and steady-state wind model and consider the
superposition of a large number of contributing components, whose nucleosynthesis-
relevant parameters (mass weight, entropy, expansion time scale, and neutron excess)
are constrained by the assumption that the integrated wind nucleosynthesis closely re-
produces the solar system distribution of r-process elements. We also test the inﬂuence
of uncertain nuclear physics.

1 INTRODUCTION

Actinides play an important role in astrophysics in diﬀerent
ways. First, the use of 232Th, 235U and 238U to estimate as-
trophysical ages has a long history, a milestone of which is
the much celebrated piece of work of Fowler & Hoyle (1960).
For long, the ﬁeld of nucleo-cosmochronology that emerged
from this paper has been aiming at the determination of the
age Tnuc of the nuclides from abundances in the material
making up the bulk of the solar system. The astrophysical
importance of Th and U was enhanced further with the ob-
servation of Th and U in some very metal-poor stars (Sneden
et al. 1996; Cayrel et al. 2001). These measurements raised
the hope of a possible nuclear-based evaluation of the age of
individual stars other than the Sun.

Additional recent observational advances have triggered
substantial interest in other actinides that are shorter-lived
than Th and U. This comes about following the measure-

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS

ment of the Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) abundances of
the Z > 70 elements, including the actinides, with unprece-
dented resolution, using the Trek detector (Westphal et al.
1998). Further signiﬁcant progress is expected by the deter-
mination of the GCR abundances of the actinides Th, U, Pu
and Cm both relative to each other and relative to the Pt-
group of elements. Precise abundance measurements of this
type would yield an estimate of the time elapsed between
the nucleosynthesis of the GCR actinides and their acceler-
ation to GCR energies (the GCR actinide propagation time
after acceleration is very short, i.e of the order of 2 My).
Hence, they would help determining whether GCRs were
accelerated out of fresh ejecta of the astrophysical r-element
sources (supernovae or neutron-star mergers), superbubble
material, or old, well-mixed galactic material.

Also attempts to measure the 244Pu content of the local
interstellar medium should be mentioned here. Such mea-

2

S. Goriely et al.

surements may allow for conclusions on the frequency of the
astrophysical events producing actinides. At present, this
can be done through the analysis of dust grains of identiﬁed
interstellar origin recovered in deep-sea reservoirs (sediments
and FeMn crusts; e.g. Paul et al. 2001; Wallner et al. 2015)
and by the recovery of 244Pu incorporated in fossil biogenic
samples (Bishop & Egli 2011). Marine sediments were also
analysed for a 244Pu signal associated with measurements of
60Fe in a ferromanganese crust (Wallner et al. 2004; Rais-
beck et al. 2007), which has been interpreted as product of a
supernova close to the solar system about 2.2 My ago (Knie
et al. 1999, 2004; Fitoussi et al. 2008).

For all these reasons, there is an obvious need to provide
detailed theoretical estimates of the possible stellar produc-
tion of actinides with half-lives in excess of typically 106 y.
Most importantly, the uncertainties in these predicted abun-
dances should be evaluated as well. While the actinides are
clearly produced by the rapid neutron-capture process (or
r-process) of stellar nucleosynthesis, the site(s) of this nucle-
osynthesis process have not been unambiguously identiﬁed
yet (Arnould et al. 2007).

Two possible astrophysical sites of r-process production
are discussed: supernovae and neutron-star mergers. In the
case of supernova explosions a variety of scenarios for r-
element creation by primary and secondary processes were
proposed. Neutron-rich jets in rare, magnetohydrodynamic
explosions of rapidly rotating stars (e.g. Winteler et al. 2012)
and neutron production by neutrino reactions in the helium
layer of compact, metal-poor exploding stars (Banerjee et al.
2011) were considered as being potentially responsible for an
early enrichment of the young Galaxy with r-process mat-
ter. However, supernovae could be a major or even dominant
source of r-process elements only if the so-called neutrino-
driven wind, a low-mass baryonic outﬂow from newly formed
neutron stars (e.g. Woosley et al. 1994; Qian & Woosley
1996; Hoﬀman et al. 1997), were able to provide an r-process
viable environment (Argast et al. 2004). Self-consistent mod-
els, however, do not only yield wind entropies that are too
low to enable a strong r-process that could make lanthanides
and actinides (e.g. Takahashi et al. 1994; Witti et al. 1994;
Roberts et al. 2010), but state-of-the-art supernova mod-
els with high-ﬁdelity neutrino transport also yield proton-
rich conditions instead of neutron excess in the wind ejecta
(H¨udepohl et al. 2010; Fischer et al. 2010; Janka 2012; Mi-
rizzi et al. 2016).

Recently, growing attention has been paid to mergers of
binary neutron stars (NS-NS) and neutron star-black hole
(NS-BH) systems as possible r-process sites (Lattimer &
Schramm 1976; Lattimer et al. 1977; Eichler et al. 1989), fol-
lowing the conﬁrmation by hydrodynamic simulations that
non-negligible amounts of matter, typically about 10−3 to
several 10−2M(cid:12), can be ejected (e.g. Rosswog et al. 1999;
Freiburghaus et al. 1999; Arnould et al. 2007; Metzger et al.
2010; Roberts et al. 2011; Goriely et al. 2011; Korobkin et
al. 2012; Bauswein et al. 2013; Goriely et al. 2013; Wanajo
et al. 2014; Perego et al. 2014; Just et al. 2015; Sekiguchi
et al. 2015; Radice et al. 2016). In contrast to the super-
nova case, investigations with growing sophistication have
so far supported NS merger ejecta as viable sites for strong
r-processing (e.g. Wanajo et al. 2014; Sekiguchi et al. 2015;
Goriely et al. 2015; Roberts et al. 2016, for steps towards
including neutrino eﬀects). In particular, comprehensive nu-

cleosynthesis calculations (Just et al. 2015; Martin et al.
2015) show that the combined contributions from both the
dynamical (prompt) ejecta expelled during NS-NS or NS-
BH mergers, and the neutrino and viscously driven outﬂows
generated during the post-merger remnant evolution of relic
neutron stars or BH-torus systems can lead to the produc-
tion of r-process elements from A (cid:38) 90 up to thorium and
uranium with an abundance distribution that reproduces
extremely well the solar distribution, as well as the elemen-
tal distribution observed in low-metallicity stars (Roederer
2011; Roederer et al. 2012).

Despite a roughly 1000 times lower NS merger rate com-
pared to the core-collapse supernova rate, NS-NS/BH merg-
ers could still explain the total amount of r-material in the
Galaxy because the amount of ejected r-process-rich mat-
ter per NS merger is roughly 1000 times higher than the
potential contribution from the neutrino-driven wind of a
supernova. Based on observed binary pulsars and popula-
tion synthesis calculations, the NS-NS merger rate is cur-
rently estimated to be within the plausible range of 3 to
190 Myr−1 (e.g. Kim et al. 2010; Dominik et al. 2012; Van-
gioni et al. 2015). Initially there were concerns that the low
rate of compact star mergers (with their correspondingly
larger ejecta masses per event) in addition to the long time
delay of binary mergers after the preceding, iron-producing
supernovae would be incompatible with the Galactic enrich-
ment history as deduced from observations of (ultra-)metal-
poor stars (Argast et al. 2004). However, more recent mod-
els of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way show a much
more promising situation. Taking into account a short-lived
binary component (with inspiral times of less than 100 Myr),
incomplete Galactic mixing and/or the sub-halo merger his-
tory of the Milky Way, these new studies conclude that dou-
ble compact star mergers might indeed be the major produc-
ers of r-process elements and might even be responsible for
the enrichment of metal-poor stars (Matteucci et al. 2014;
Komiya et al. 2014; Mennekens & Vanbeveren 2014; Shen
et al. 2014; van de Voort et al. 2014; Vangioni et al. 2015;
Wehmeyer et al. 2015; Ishimaru et al. 2015). Although these
investigations, which are based on largely diﬀerent model-
ing approaches, ranging from traditional, highly simpliﬁed
box models to hydrodynamical simulations, do not agree in
all quantitative details of the picture, the majority of them
suggests that compact binary mergers as r-process sites are
better compatible with the considerable event-to-event scat-
ter of the r-process abundances in metal-poor stars.

If NS-NS/BH mergers are indeed the main cosmic
sources of heavy r-process matter and supernovae were
ruled out as production sites of these nuclei, the rarity of
compact-binary mergers would leave little hope for discov-
ering on Earth the presence of radioisotopes, like 244Pu, that
have originated in such rare events. Indeed, this expectation
seems to be conﬁrmed by recent measurements of the 244Pu
abundance in deep-ocean reservoirs (Wallner et al. 2015). In
combination with abundance measurements for the Early
Solar System this experimental result was therefore inter-
preted as strong evidence for the origin of 244Pu from com-
pact binary mergers (Hotokezaka et al. 2015).

However, more experimental and observational conﬁr-
mation with better statistics and based on alternative reser-
voirs is highly desirable to consolidate the picture suggested
by the existing measurements, which are subject to consid-

which appears to be a reasonable ﬁrst approximation even
in two-dimensional simulations, at least at late enough times
after core bounce (Pruet et al. 2005; Arcones & Janka 2011).
In addition, the wind is generally treated as a stationary
ﬂow, meaning no explicit time dependence of any physical
quantity at a given radial position r, so that ∂x/∂t = 0, let x
be the velocity, temperature, density, internal energy, pres-
sure, entropy, or composition. The validity of this approxi-
mation is discussed in Thompson et al. (2001), where it is
concluded that stationarity may be reasonably assured, even
if some caution is warranted. Newtonian, post-Newtonian,
and relativistic descriptions of spherically symmetric, sta-
tionary neutrino-driven winds originating from the surface
of proto-neutron stars (PNS) have been developed along the
lines of a long experience with previous mathematical treat-
ments of the solar wind and of accretion ﬂows onto black
holes.

The wind model adopted here corresponds to the ana-
lytical Newtonian, adiabatic and steady-state wind model,
referred to in the following as NASS, derived by Takahashi
& Janka (1997). It provides a simple, fully analytical de-
scription of the dynamics of the wind outﬂow at relatively
late times or suﬃciently far away from the PNS surface. The
NASS wind model relies on the general assumptions listed
above, in particular those of a Newtonian PNS gravitational
potential and of an adiabatic expansion. In addition, all the
elementary ν/¯ν and e−/e+ weak interaction processes are
assumed to be frozen out, nuclear β-decays not to aﬀect
Ye or s, and possible deviations from nuclear equilibrium
with regard to strong and electromagnetic interactions to
have no inﬂuence on the thermodynamical properties of the
wind. Under such simplifying assumptions, the NASS model
cannot predict any time variations of the entropy s, electron
fraction Ye, or of the wind mass loss rate dM/dt ≡ ˙M , which
are thus treated as constant input parameters.

The basic NASS wind dynamics in the regime under
consideration, and in particular for high enough entropies,
is well approximated (Takahashi & Janka 1997; Arnould et
al. 2007) by

where M∗ is the PNS mass, r the radius, v the velocity, T

obtained by setting a boundary condition and is usually ex-
pressed as a function of the wind energy: E = fw × Ewind,
where Ewind = 3v2
s /2 and vs equals the local adiabatic sound
speed (Arnould et al. 2007). For fw = 1, the solutions cor-
respond to a sonic wind, whereas for fw > 1 they are of
subsonic wind type and usually referred to as breeze solu-
tions. More details about the wind model can be found in
Arnould et al. (2007).

The entropy is dominated by photons, electrons and
positrons in the wind so that the so-called ‘radiation en-
tropy’ srad = sγ + se− + se+ is given by

erable uncertainties associated with limited statistics and
our incomplete knowledge of the probability with which
supernova-made nuclei make their way to Earth and ﬁnally
end up in the investigated sample material. Such caveats cer-
tainly justify ongoing eﬀorts to directly identify supernovae
as cosmic sources of r-process matter or, alternatively, to
derive increasingly stronger bounds to the supernova ori-
gin of this matter by searching for r-nuclei in the envelopes
of supernova companion stars and for radioisotopes in dated
terrestrial sediments. It should be kept in mind that without
any unambiguous identiﬁcation of an r-process source by the
in-situ detection of r-nuclei our understanding of the astro-
physical origin of this nucleosynthetic component is based
on complex indirect arguments and on theoretical models
with their natural limitations. Such limitations are associ-
ated with numerous simpliﬁcations that still enter the mod-
eling of supernovae as well as compact binary mergers, with
constraints set by the ﬁnite numerical resolution and by the
omission of physics that could play a role like, for example,
fallback in supernovae and associated re-ejection of matter
(Fryer et al. 2006), strong neutron-star magnetic ﬁelds (e.g.
Thompson 2003; Suzuki & Nagataki 2005; Metzger et al.
2007; Vlasov et al. 2014), a rigorous treatment of neutrino
oscillations, or non-standard weak-interaction physics.

With the goal to assist future experimental searches
we provide here state-of-the-art estimates of the possible
production of the actinides. In order to circumvent the un-
certainties of current core-collapse supernova and neutrino-
wind models, we adopt an optimistic point of view here and
assume that the r-process taking place in type-II supernovae
is capable of producing elements up to the heaviest actinides
and in addition that each such event leads to an r-abundance
distribution similar to the one found in the solar system.
The striking similarity between the solar distribution of r-
element abundances in the 56 (cid:54) Z (cid:54) 76 range and the cor-
responding abundance pattern observed in ultra-metal-poor
stars like CS 22892-052 (Sneden et al. 2003, 2008, 2009) led
to the conclusion that every astrophysical event producing
r-elements gives rise to a solar system-like r-abundance dis-
tribution, at least for elements above Ba. Such observations
therefore tend to lend support to our assumption, although
recent observations also indicate that star-to-star variations
in the r-process content of metal-poor globular clusters may
be a common, although not ubiquitous, phenomenon (Honda
et al. 2007; Roederer et al. 2010; Roederer 2011).

Section 2 describes the analytical ν-driven wind model
considered in the present work, while our ﬁtting procedure
used to construct an optimal reproduction of the solar sys-
tem r-abundance distribution is outlined in Sect. 3. The dif-
ferent nuclear inputs used in the present study are detailed
in Sect. 4. Finally, our ﬁt to the solar system r-abundances,
the astrophysical ranges required for this ﬁt as well as our
predictions concerning the actinide production are presented
in Sect. 5. Conclusions are drawn in Sect. 6.

Several wind models of analytical or semi-analytical nature
exist. They diﬀer in their level of physical sophistication
and in their way to parametrize the wind characteristics. In
all cases, the wind is assumed to be spherically symmetric,

where fe = 1 in the high-T limit when electrons and
positrons are highly relativistic, and decreases with T for
high s0
rad-values. In the present study, it is approximated by
fe = T 2
9 /(T 2
9 + 5.04), where T9 is the temperature expressed

in 109K (Witti et al. 1994). Note that the nucleosynthe-
sis in the wind is followed by starting at a temperature of
T9 = 9 so that the total entropy is essentially equal to the
radiation entropy (within a few percents). Note that the ‘ra-
diation entropy’ is measured here per baryon in units of the
Boltzmann constant kB and includes both the photon and
lepton contributions, but not the baryonic ones. For the ini-
tial conditions adopted here, the latter amounts to typically
9 kB/baryon.

In the present study, three ranges (sets) of wind con-
ditions are considered. In Range I, we include entropies
50 (cid:54) srad (cid:54) 250 binned in steps of 50, electron fractions
0.30 (cid:54) Ye (cid:54) 0.48 in steps of 0.02, mass outﬂow rates
˙M =
0.03, 0.06 and 0.30 × 10−5M(cid:12)/s, and fw = 3. In Range II,
a restricted set is considered, i.e. entropies 50 (cid:54) srad (cid:54) 200
in steps of 50, electron fractions 0.30 (cid:54) Ye (cid:54) 0.48 in steps
˙M = 0.06 × 10−5M(cid:12)/s,
of 0.02, a single outﬂow rate of
and fw = 3. In Range III, a wind solution is considered,
i.e. fw = 1, with entropies 50 (cid:54) srad (cid:54) 250 in steps of 50,
electron fractions 0.30 (cid:54) Ye (cid:54) 0.48 in steps of 0.02, and an
outﬂow rate ˙M = 0.06 × 10−5M(cid:12)/s.

3 FITTING THE SOLAR SYSTEM

R-ABUNDANCE DISTRIBUTION

In a similar way to that developed in the multi-event canon-
ical s- or r-process models (Goriely & Arnould 1996; Goriely
1997), it is possible to deﬁne a superposition of a large num-
ber of ν-driven wind components (“events”) that correspond
to diﬀerent thermodynamic conditions. Each canonical event
is characterized by a given entropy srad, electron fraction Ye,
outﬂow rate ˙M , and wind energy scaling factor fw.

The combination of r-process events that provides
the best ﬁt to the solar abundances can then be de-
rived with the aid of an iterative inversion procedure
that has been applied to astronomical
inverse problems
(Lucy 1974) but also to parametric r-process calculations
(Bouquelle et al. 1996; Goriely & Arnould 1996; Goriely
Z,A of a nuclide (Z, A) is

The iteration procedure starts with a uniform distribution

of initial weights Φ(0)(srad, Ye,
initially the same weight) and converges after several itera-
tions to a “best-ﬁt” abundance curve NZ,A. The correspond-
˙M , fw) allows us to identify the
ing weight proﬁle Φ(srad, Ye,
events that contribute most signiﬁcantly to the synthesis of
each ﬁtted element.

Two diﬀerent sets of solar system r-abundance distri-
butions are considered in the present study. They diﬀer by
the way the s-process contribution to the solar system is
estimated. Goriely (1999) used the multi-event canonical s-
process model and included a detailed analysis of observa-
tional, astrophysical and nuclear physics uncertainties, while
Bisterzo et al. (2014) estimated the s-process abundances on
the basis of a Galactic chemical evolution model with AGB
yields based on parametrized 13C proﬁles to generate the
s-process irradiation. Due to the more complex approach,
uncertainties are not estimated in the latter case and the
contribution from the weak s-component in massive stars
responsible for the solar production of A (cid:54) 90 nuclei is
not included either. The corresponding solar r-abundance
distributions can diﬀer signiﬁcantly for s-dominant nuclei,
especially in the Pb region, as shown in Fig. 1.

4 NUCLEAR PHYSICS INPUT

The nucleosynthesis is followed with a reaction network in-
cluding all 5000 species from protons up to Z = 110 lying be-
tween the valley of β-stability and the neutron-drip line. All
charged-particle fusion reactions on light and medium-mass
elements that play a role when the nuclear statistical equi-
librium freezes out are included in addition to radiative neu-
tron captures and photodisintegrations. The reaction rates
on light species are taken from the NETGEN library, which
includes all the latest compilations of experimentally deter-
mined reaction rates (Xu et al. 2013). By default, experimen-
tally unknown reactions are estimated with the TALYS code
(Goriely et al. 2008; Koning et al. 2012) on the basis of the
HFB-21 nuclear masses (Goriely et al. 2010), the HFB plus
combinatorial nuclear level densities (Goriely et al. 2008b)

Fission and β-decay processes are also included, i.e. neutron-
induced ﬁssion, spontaneous ﬁssion, β-delayed ﬁssion, as well
as β-delayed neutron emission (Goriely 2015). The β-decay
processes are taken from the updated version of the Gross
Theory (Tachibana et al. 1990) based on the HFB-21 Q-
values (Goriely et al. 2010), when not available experimen-
tally, whereas all ﬁssion processes are estimated on the basis
of the HFB-14 ﬁssion paths (Goriely et al. 2007) and the full
calculation of the corresponding barrier penetration (Goriely
et al. 2009). The ﬁssion fragment distribution is taken from
the SPY model as described in Goriely et al. (2013). This
nuclear physics set represents our standard input. Due to the
large uncertainties still aﬀecting the properties of the neu-
trinos, in particular their luminosities and temperatures, no
neutrino interactions on nuclei are included in the present
calculations. (Neutrino interactions with free nucleons in the
close vicinity of the neutron star are considered to be impor-
tant in setting the dynamical and thermodynamic conditions
and the neutron-to-proton ratio in the wind outﬂow, which
is inherently accounted for by our parametric wind model.)
To estimate the sensitivity of the abundance calcula-
tions with respect to the still uncertain nuclear physics pre-
dictions far away from the valley of β-stability, diﬀerent
nuclear ingredients are also considered in addition to the
above-described standard set. These include

• HFB-31: reactions rates determined on the basis of
the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) HFB-31 mass model
(Goriely et al. 2016); all other inputs remaining identical;
• D1M: reactions rates determined on the basis of the
D1M Gogny-HFB mass model (Goriely et al. 2009b); all
other inputs remaining identical;
• FRDM: reactions rates determined with the 2012 ver-
sion of the FRDM mass model (M¨oller et al. 2016), the back-
shifted Fermi Gas model for nuclear level densities (Kon-
ing et al. 2008) and Lorentzian-type E1 strength function
(Kopecky & Uhl 1990); β-decay rates are taken from the

5.1 Actinide production

The solar system abundances have been ﬁtted assuming dif-
ferent ranges of astrophysical conditions for the ν-driven
wind and diﬀerent nuclear physics inputs, as described in
the previous sections. One example (Case 1; Table 1) of a ﬁt

nuclear physics input.

corresponding to the Range I of astrophysical conditions and
the standard nuclear physics input, is shown in Fig. 2. It can
be seen that the solar distribution (in this case, taken from
Goriely 1999) is rather well ﬁtted, although deviations can
be observed, in particular in the rare-earth region. The cor-
responding distributions of entropies and electron fractions
are illustrated for this standard case in Fig. 3. For illustra-
tion, additional ﬁts with Range II of astrophysical conditions
and the nuclear physics inputs corresponding to D1M and
FRDM (Cases 7 and 11, respectively; Table 1) are given in
Fig. 4. It will also be noticed that the restricted Range II is
already suﬃcient to provide the conditions needed to repro-
duce the solar system distribution fairly well. The statistical
weights of entropies and electron fractions needed to obtain
these ﬁts are obviously dependent on the adopted range of
astrophysical conditions as well as the nuclear physics in-
puts, as shown in Fig. 5.

Considering diﬀerent combinations for the solar r-
abundance distributions, ranges of thermodynamic condi-
tions and nuclear physics inputs, quite some diﬀerent pre-
dictions for the production of actinides can be derived as
summarized in Table 1. In particular, it can be seen that
wind solutions (fw = 1) in the Range III of thermody-
namic conditions lead to a signiﬁcantly lower production of
some actinides compared to the breeze solutions (fw = 3 in
Range II). Nuclear physics inputs, in particular nuclear mass
models (and the corresponding rates) as well as β-decay
rates, have also a non-negligible impact on the abundance
predictions, as already well established for decades. Uncor-
related lower and upper limits to the production of the long-
lived actinides can be deduced and are also given in Table 1.
The uncertainties for the 232Th production are found to be
considerably larger than those for the production of 244Pu
and 247Cm. For comparison, the upper and lower limits es-
timated within the multi-event canonical model (Goriely &
Arnould 2001) on the basis on very diﬀerent astrophysical
conditions and nuclear physics inputs are also given in Ta-
ble 1.

log(U/Th) = −0.94 ± 0.09 (Cayrel et al. 2001, and private
communication). The 0.09 dex observational error gives rise
to a ±2 Gyr uncertainty on the estimate of T ∗
U,Th. For each
simulation, the estimated age of CS 31082-001 is given in
Table 1. The ages obtained are reasonably consistent with
the WMAP estimate of 13.8 Gyr (Ade et al. 2015).

5.2 Actinide yields per supernova event

Table 1 gives the abundances of Pb and of the main ac-
tinides (in the Si=106 scale) produced by the r-process in
the ν-driven wind, assuming the r-process is universal and
produces an abundance distribution identical to the solar
one. To estimate the yields of ejected material per super-
nova event, we have to know the total amount of matter ac-
cumulated in the ν-driven wind and able to make r-process
elements. Since no realistic ν-driven wind model exists that
leads to a successful r-process, this quantity remains un-
known. For this reason, we adopt here a ﬁducial value of
Mwind = 7× 10−4M(cid:12) ejected per Galactic supernova as well
as an amount of the r-only nucleus 130Te produced by each
supernova of about 6 × 10−6M(cid:12) (Takahashi et al. 1994).
Using now an abundance of 1.59 of 130Te in the Si=106
scale (Figs. 1, 2, 4), it is straightforward to estimate the
ejected yields for each actinide. The upper and lower limits
of these yields are given in Table 2 on the basis of the min-
imum and maximum abundances given in Table 1. Clearly,
a large uncertainty factor should also be applied to the
Mwind value and correspondingly to the yields, or equiva-
lently the yields of Table 2 should be taken proportional to
the Mej/(7 × 10−4M(cid:12)) where Mej is the still unknown total
mass of wind ejecta per supernova that contribute to the r-
process production. A rather ﬁrm theoretical upper limit for
this number may be a few 10−3 M(cid:12) (close to the maximum
total mass of neutrino-driven wind ejecta; R. Bollig, private
communication), but according to present state-of-the-art
supernova models Mej is expected to vanish (H¨udepohl et
al. 2010; Fischer et al. 2010; Janka 2012; Mirizzi et al. 2016).
It should also be recalled here that our numbers in Table 2

of the ultra-metal-poor star CS 31082-001. Indeed, accurate
observations of heavy r-elements have been used to estimate
the age of ultra-metal-poor stars on the basis of the funda-
mental assumption that the r-process is universal (Sneden
et al. 1996; Cowan et al. 1997; Goriely & Clerbaux 1999). In
particular, if Th and U lines could be observed accurately
and simultaneously in metal-poor stars, a relatively reliable
age estimate could be derived from the expression

Note that the Th abundance in the r-process ratio of Eq. (6)
corresponds to the 232Th value after decay of its shorter-
lived progenitors 236U and 244Pu, and the U abundance cor-
responds to the 238U contribution only. Th and U lines have
been observed in particular in the CS 31082-001 star with a

rely on the fundamental assumption that the r-process tak-
ing place in core-collapse supernovae is capable of producing
elements up to the heaviest actinides and, in addition, that
each of such events leads to an r-abundance distribution
similar to the one found in the solar system.

6 CONCLUSIONS

We derived updated estimates of the production of the ra-
dioactive actinides of 232Th, 235,236,238U, 237Np, 244Pu, and
247Cm and of the corresponding uncertainty ranges based on
the assumption that the neutrino-driven wind of the proto-
neutron star in core collapse supernovae is able to provide
r-process viable conditions and can well reproduce the uni-
versal r-process abundance pattern observed in the Sun and
found in metal-poor stars. Since current state-of-the-art hy-

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–9

drodynamical models of supernova explosions and of the
neutrino-driven wind do not yield the dynamic and ther-
modynamic conditions needed for the production of heavy r-
process material, we base our study on the simple, analytical
NASS (Newtonian, adiabatic, steady-state) wind model and
take into account the mass-weighted superposition of a large
number of wind components with diﬀerent nucleosynthesis-
relevant characteristics of entropy, expansion time scale, and
neutron excess. The set of chosen conditions is constrained
by the ability of the integrated wind material to match the
solar r-abundance distribution. In order to explore the sensi-
tivity of our estimates for the actinide production to uncer-
tain nuclear physics, we tested the inﬂuence of six diﬀerent
sets of nuclear-rate ingredients.

The consideration of neutrino-driven winds of super-
novae as possible r-process site, despite the unfavorable con-
ditions provided by current hydrodynamical models, and the
combination of wind components under the mentioned con-
straint, can be justiﬁed by the fact that also the state-of-the-
art models still suﬀer from major uncertainties, e.g. with
respect to neutrino opacities in correlated nuclear matter,
the eﬀects of potentially strong magnetic ﬁelds inside and
around the nascent NS, or the incomplete exploration of
neutrino-oscillation eﬀects and possible non-standard weak
interaction physics in the PNS environment. On the other
hand, despite considerable modeling progress and generally
more promising properties of the ejecta dynamics, also NS-
NS and/or NS-BH mergers are by far not established as the
main sources of heavy r-process nuclei, because in this case
too, major uncertainties still aﬀect the weak-interaction sec-
tor as well as the description of strong magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects.

S. Goriely et al.

Further observational eﬀorts for a positive conﬁrmation
of the one or the other or of both possible sources are there-
fore needed. This includes searches of electromagnetic tran-
sients associated with the radiation emission of NS-NS/BH
merger ejecta heated by the radioactive decay of r-process
nuclei (see for example, Metzger et al. 2010; Roberts et al.
2011; Goriely et al. 2011; Korobkin et al. 2012; Bauswein et
al. 2013; Kasen et al. 2015; Martin et al. 2015) as well as
the exploration of cosmic and terrestrial reservoirs for sig-
natures of freshly produced r-nuclei. Our work is intended
to facilitate the observational and experimental analyses of
the latter kind and their interpretation.
We ﬁnd a considerable spread of the results of actinide
yields with the largest uncertainty (a factor of ∼100) for
232Th and the lowest uncertainty for 244Pu (factor of ∼12)
and for 247Cm (factor of ∼7), with supersonically expanding
wind solutions producing considerably less actinide material
than more slowly, subsonically expanding breeze outﬂows.
For investigations of terrestrial material like recently per-
formed by Wallner et al. (2015), it is interesting to know the
isotope-production ratio of 244Pu compared to the long-lived
radioactive nucleus 60Fe. Current supernova models predict
a yield of 60Fe of ∼ 3 × 10−5 M(cid:12) per massive-star death or
∼ 4 × 10−5 M(cid:12) per supernova (Sukhbold et al. 2015). Since
this theoretical value seems to exceed estimates based on
cosmic-rays near the Earth by about a factor of 2 (Sukhbold
et al. 2015), we consider here a 60Fe output per exploding
massive star of ∼ 2× 10−5 M(cid:12). With this number we obtain
a theoretical range for the supernova-produced 244Pu/60Fe
isotope ratio between roughly 1.2× 10−3 and 1.4× 10−2, us-
ing the yields of Table 2. With experimentally determined
limits of less than 10−4 for their crust and sediment samples,
Wallner et al. (2015) set a bound still more than a factor of
10 below our lower limit. Therefore this bound seems to
exclude a recent insemination of the Earth by r-process ma-
terial from a frequent source like supernovae, in particular
from a nearby supernova ∼2.2 My in the past. However, the
exclusion may not be as convincing as suggested by the two
orders of magnitude discrepancy advocated by Wallner et
al. (2015). Not only the probability with which 244Pu from
a possible supernova origin ends up in the investigated ma-
terial samples is uncertain, also the extreme sensitivity of
the actinide production to the model variations tested in
our work should be taken as a warning.
