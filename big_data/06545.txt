RICCI FLOW ON SINGULAR MANIFOLDS

Abstract. In this paper we prove local existence of a Ricci ﬂow starting at an
incomplete manifold with edge singularities and bounded Ricci curvature, ﬂowing for a
short time within a class of incomplete edge manifolds. We derive regularity properties
for the corresponding family of Riemannian metrics and establish boundedness of
the Riemannian curvature tensor along the ﬂow. For Riemannian metrics that are
suﬃciently close to a Ricci ﬂat incomplete edge metric, we prove long time existence of
the Ricci ﬂow. Our results in particular include the case of spaces with isolated conical
singularities. The proof works by a careful analysis of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian and
the Ricci de Turck ﬂow equation.

1. Introduction and statement of the main result

Geometric ﬂows have attracted considerable interest and have been in the focus
of extensive research in recent years, among all most notably the Ricci ﬂow which
provided the decisive tool in the proof of Thurston’s geometrization and the Poincare
conjectures. In the present discussion we are interested in the Ricci ﬂow of a class of
compact manifolds with incomplete edge singular Riemannian metrics.

Such singular Ricci ﬂows, which stay in a class of singular spaces, have been consid-
ered on K¨ahler manifolds in connection to a recent resolution of the Calabi-Yau con-
jecture on Fano manifolds by Donaldson [Don11] and Tian [Tia12], see also Jeﬀres,
Mazzeo and Rubinstein [JMR11] for a proof of existence of K¨ahler Einstein metrics on

edge manifolds using microlocal arguments. In a related paper, Liu [LiZh14] studies
the conical K¨ahler Ricci ﬂow.

In two dimensions Ricci ﬂow reduces to the scalar Yamabe ﬂow equation and has been
studied by Mazzeo, Rubinstein and Sesum in [MRS11] and Yin [Yin10]. Yamabe ﬂow
of singular edge manifolds in general dimension has been studied by the author in a joint
work with Bahuaud in [BaVe14]. In the subsequent paper [BaVe15] we study the
long time behaviour of Yamabe ﬂow of edge manifolds to attack the Yamabe problem.
Yamabe problem using elliptic methods has been studied by Akutagawa and Botvinnik
in [AkBo03] in case of isolated conical singularities, as well as by Akutagawa, Carron
and Mazzeo in [ACM12] on edge manifolds.

In the singular setting, Ricci ﬂow loses its uniqueness and alternatively to our treat-
ment, Giesen-Topping [GiTo10, GiTo11] obtained a solution to the Ricci ﬂow on
surfaces starting at a singular metric that becomes instantaneously complete. More-
over, Simon [Sim13] studied Ricci ﬂow in dimension two and three that smoothens out
the singularity.

The setting of singular edge manifolds of dimension higher than two, which are
not necessarily K¨ahler, is much more complicated since the Ricci ﬂow equation does
not reduce to a scalar equation and one is forced to study an equation of tensors.
The present paper provides a ﬁrst step into this direction and establishes short time
existence of Ricci ﬂow starting at and preserving a class of incomplete edge metrics
with bounded Ricci curvature. We point out that our analysis in particular applies to
the setting of isolated conical singularities.

We now proceed with an introduction into the basic geometry of incomplete edge
spaces, deﬁnition of H¨older spaces in which short time existence of Ricci ﬂow is estab-
lished, and formulation of the main results.

1.1. Incomplete edge singularities.

Deﬁnition 1.1. Consider an open interior M of a compact manifold with boundary
∂M. Let U = (0, 1)x × ∂M be a tubular neighborhood of the boundary in M with the
radial function x : U → (0, 1). Assume ∂M is the total space of a ﬁbration φ : ∂M → B
with the base B and ﬁbre F being compact smooth manifolds, dim F ≥ 1. Consider
a smooth Riemannian metric gB on the base manifold B and a symmetric 2-tensor gF
on ∂M which restricts to a ﬁxed Riemannian metric on the ﬁbres. By a small abuse of
notation, we write gF for the Riemannian metric on ﬁbres as well. An incomplete edge
metric g on M is deﬁned here to be a smooth Riemannian metric such that g = g + h
with |h|g = O(x) and

g ↾ U = dx2 + x2gF + φ∗gB.

We call such an edge metric admissible if the ﬁbration φ : (∂M, gF + φ∗gB) →
(B, gB) is a Riemannian submersion in the following sense. Split the tangent bundle
Tp∂M canonically into vertical and horizontal subspaces T V
p ∂M. The vertical
subspace T V
p ∂M is the tangent space to the ﬁbre of φ through p, and the horizontal
p ∂M ygF ⊂ T ∗∂M (y denotes
p ∂M is the annihilator of the subbundle T V
subspace T H

p ∂M ⊕ T H

contraction). Then φ is a Riemannian submersion if the tensor gF restricted to T H
p ∂M
vanishes. Note that in contrast to the corresponding analysis of the Yamabe ﬂow in
[BaVe14], we do not impose further assumptions on the metric to deﬁne admissibility.
In fact other conditions on the metric g will be imposed below and are connected to
assumption of bounded curvature as well as the spectral analysis of the associated
Lichnerowicz Laplace operator.

1.2. Geometry of incomplete edge spaces. Choose local coordinates in the singu-
lar neighborhood U as follows. Consider local coordinates (y) on B, lifted to M and
then extended inwards to the interior. Let coordinates (z) restrict to local coordinates
on ﬁbres F . This deﬁnes local coordinates (x, y, z) in the neighborhood U .

Consider the Lie algebra of edge vector ﬁelds Ve, which by deﬁnition are smooth in
the interior and at the boundary ∂M tangent to the ﬁbres of the ﬁbration. In local
coordinates, Ve is locally generated by

(cid:26)x

∂
∂z1

, . . . ,

∂

∂zf(cid:27) ,

with coeﬃcients in the linear combinations of the derivatives being by deﬁnition smooth
on M . The complete edge tangent bundle eT M is deﬁned by requiring that the edge
vector ﬁelds Ve form a spanning set of sections Ve = C∞(M, eT M). The dual to eT M
is denoted by eT ∗M and is generated locally by the following one-forms

(cid:26)dx

x

,

dy1
x

, . . . ,

dyb
x

, dz1, . . . , dzf(cid:27) .

(1.1)

(1.2)

These diﬀerential one-forms, though singular in the usual sense, are smooth as sec-
tions of eT ∗M. We can now deﬁne the incomplete edge tangent space ieT M by asking
C∞(M, ieT M) = x−1C∞(M, eT M).
Its dual, the incomplete edge cotangent space
ieT ∗M is related to its complete counterpart by C∞(M, ieT ∗M) = xC∞(M, eT ∗M),
and is spanned locally by

{dx, dy1, . . . , dyb, xdz1, . . . , xdzf} .

Observe that the incomplete edge metric g can be viewed as a smooth section of the
symmetric 2-tensors on ieT ∗M, which we write as g ∈ Sym2(ieT ∗M). We adopt such a
convention of Riemannian metrics viewed as sections of Sym2(ieT ∗M) from now when-
ever we don’t say otherwise. Note also that the generators of ieT M and ieT ∗M are of
bounded length with respect to the Riemannian metric g and its inverse.

Deﬁnition 1.2. An incomplete edge manifold (M, g) with an admissible edge metric
is said to be of bounded geometry if

(i) Riemannian curvature (4, 0) tensor acting on ieT M is O(x−1) as x → 0,
(ii) the Ricci curvature acting on ieT M is bounded up to the edge at x = 0.

Note that we do not impose boundedness on the full Riemannian curvature tensor,

which can still be singular for the Ricci ﬂow to exist.

The assumption of bounded Ricci curvature is satisﬁed naturally in certain geometric

settings with a codimension one edge singularity.

4

BORIS VERTMAN

In the case of a codimension two singularity, the normal bundle NB of B inside T M
is a ﬁbre bundle over B with the ﬁbre being a two-dimensional disc D2. The involution
on D2 deﬁnes a global action σ on the normal bundle NB, which may now be viewed
as a branched covering of itself. Any σ-invariant smooth metric on NB descends to a
singular edge metric on NB/σ and extends smoothly to M. This deﬁnes an orbifold
metric with incomplete edge singularity and bounded geometry.
In a more general
setting, any singularity covered by a smooth branched covering space admits a singular
metric of bounded Ricci curvature.

Another quite explicit example is the case of a knot S1 embedded into S3 or any other
orientable 3-manifold. The normal bundle of S1 is trivial and may be equipped with an
edge metric of any given angle. The ﬁbres of the normal bundle are ﬂat two-dimensional
cones and the resulting metric, smoothly extended away from the singularity, is of
bounded geometry.

Let us point out the assumption of a bounded geometry is obviously satisﬁed in the
geometric setting of g ↾ U being a higher order perturbation of a Ricci-ﬂat incomplete
edge metric.

1.3. H¨older spaces on singular manifolds.

Deﬁnition 1.3. The H¨older space Cα
that are continuous on M × [0, T ] with ﬁnite α-th H¨older norm1
(1.3)

kukα := kuk∞ + sup(cid:18) |u(p, t) − u(p′, t′)|

dM (p, p′)α + |t − t′|

2(cid:19) < ∞,

α

ie(M×[0, T ]), α ∈ (0, 1), consists of functions u(p, t)

where the distance function dM (p, p′) between any two points p, p′ ∈ M is deﬁned with
respect to the incomplete edge metric g, and in terms of the local coordinates (x, y, z)
in the singular neighborhood U given equivalently by

dM ((x, y, z), (x′, y′, z′)) =(cid:0)|x − x′|2 + (x + x′)2|z − z′|2 + |y − y′|2(cid:1) 1

The supremum is taken over all (p, p′, t) ∈ M 2 × [0, T ].

2 .

We wish to explain in what way the H¨older space Cα

ie introduced above, may be
deﬁned locally. Consider any ﬁnite cover {Ui}i∈I of M by open coordinate charts and a
partition of unity {φj}j∈J subordinate to that cover. We can deﬁne a H¨older norm by

α :=Xj∈J
kukφ

kφjukα.

Such a norm is equivalent to our original H¨older norm, since for any tuple (p, p′) ∈
M 2 with distance dM (p, p′) > δ bounded away from zero, the quotient in the second
summand of the formula (1.3) is bounded by 2δ−1kuk∞. Consequently, we may assume
without loss of generality that the tuples (p, p′) are always taken from within the same
coordinate patch of a given atlas.

1Finiteness of the H¨older norm kukα in particular implies that u is continuous on the closure M up

2

to the edge singularity, and the supremum may be taken over (p, p′, t) ∈ M

× [0, T ].

We also need a notion of H¨older spaces with values in the vector bundle S of sym-
0(ieT ∗M), with an ﬁbrewise inner product h induced by
ie(M × [0, T ], S), if for a local orthonormal

metric trace-free 2-tensors Sym2
the Riemannian metric g. We say ω ∈ Cα

ie(M × [0, T ]).

We now introduce two types of higher order H¨older spaces C2+α

(M × [0, T ]) and
(M × [0, T ], S), which specify regularity of solutions under application of edge

C2+α
vector ﬁelds Ve. More precisely, we deﬁne

where diﬀerentiation is understood a priori in the distributional sense. Both H¨older
spaces are similar but not the same. The fundamental diﬀerence is that C2+α
(M ×
[0, T ], S) imposes boundedness under multiplication by x−1, while elements of C2+α
(M×
[0, T ]) in general do not stay bounded under x−1 multiplication.

In order to deﬁne the corresponding H¨older norms, we consider as before any ﬁnite
cover {Ui}i∈I of M by open coordinate charts and a partition of unity {φj}j∈J subor-
dinate to that cover. By a small abuse of notation we now identify Ve with a ﬁnite set
of generating edge vector ﬁelds, when applied to sections with compact support in U ;
and write Ve for any local orthonormal frame of vector ﬁelds, when applied to sections
with compact support in a coordinate chart with distance bounded from below away
e , x−1Ve,√t∂t, id} and
from the edge singularity. We may now introduce D := {x−1V 2
e , x−1Ve, x−1,√t∂t, id}. We can now write the H¨older norms on the higher
D′ := {x−1V 2
order H¨older spaces as follows

kuk2+α =Xj∈J XX∈D ′ kX(φju)kα,

Any diﬀerent choice of coordinate charts and the subordinate partition of unity, as well
as diﬀerent choices of generating vector ﬁelds Ve deﬁne equivalent H¨older norms.

ularity under application of the Laplace Beltrami operator ∆ of (M, g) acting on func-

(M × [0, T ], S) replaces ∆ with the Lichnerowicz Laplace
operator ∆L acting on symmetric trace-free 2-tensors Sym2

will be discussed explicitly in the next section. More precisely, we introduce

Such H¨older spaces, where the choice of allowable second order derivatives is re-
stricted to the corresponding Laplace operators, have been an important tool in study-
ing K¨ahler-Einstein edge metrics by [Don11, JMR11], used crucially for solving the
Calabi conjecture on Fano manifolds, as well as in the discussion of the Yamabe ﬂow
by the ﬁrst author jointly with Bahuaud [BaVe14]. Note that our H¨older spaces

1.4. Existence of the singular Ricci ﬂow. While of smooth compact manifolds,
Ricci ﬂow continues to be a focal point of intensive research, on singular spaces even
existence of Ricci ﬂow is an open problem. In this paper we study the Ricci de Turck
ﬂow which relates to the Ricci ﬂow by a family of diﬀeomorphisms and deﬁnes a strongly
parabolic equation.

Our ﬁrst man result establishes short time existence of Ricci de Turck ﬂow start-
ing at an admissible incomplete edge metric of H¨older regular geometry and ﬂowing
through the space of singular metrics, which preserves the admissible edge structure
and bounded geometry. The ﬂow metric need not remain H¨older-regular though. The
result holds under an additional assumption of tangential stability, which is a spec-
tral condition imposed upon the Lichnerowicz Laplace operator introduced below in
Deﬁnition 2.1.

Theorem 1.5. Consider an incomplete edge manifold (M, g0) with an admissible edge
metric and H¨older-regular geometry, satisfying the assumption of tangential stability.
Then for short time g0 may be evolved under the Ricci de Turck ﬂow into a family
of Riemannian metrics g(t) within the space of admissible edge metrics of bounded
geometry and certain H¨older regularity for some ﬁnite time T > 0. If moreover, the
Riemannian curvature tensor of g0 is bounded, then the Riemannian curvature tensor
of g(t) is bounded as well.

RICCI FLOW ON SINGULAR MANIFOLDS

We will also address the relation between the Ricci de Turck and the Ricci ﬂow. In
fact, while the Ricci ﬂow metric is still of bounded geometry, its H¨older regularity will
be diﬀerent from the H¨older regularity of the Ricci de Turck ﬂow.

Our second main result concerns Ricci ﬂow starting at metrics that are in a certain
sense higher order small perturbations of Ricci ﬂat incomplete edge metrics. In that
case we actually obtain long time existence. In a forthcoming paper we intend to discuss
stability, i.e. convergence of that ﬂow to the Ricci ﬂat edge metric.

Theorem 1.6. Consider an incomplete edge manifold (M, h) with an admissible Ricci
ﬂat edge metric, satisfying the assumption of tangential stability.
If g0 is a higher
order suﬃciently small perturbation of h, then a Ricci de Turck ﬂow g(t) of admissible
incomplete edge metrics with bounded Riemannian curvature, starting at g0, exists for
all time and stays in a small ε-neighborhood of h, uniformly in t ≥ 0.

In fact, Ricci ﬂow through singular metrics has been studied by various authors in
dimension two, e.g. by Mazzeo, Rubinstein and Sesum in [MRS11], the ﬁrst author
jointly with Bahuaud in [BaVe14]. Somewhat diﬀerent from the approach taken here,
is the work by Giesen and Topping on instantaneously complete Ricci ﬂow in [GiTo10]
and [GiTo11]. Another alternative approach has been taken by Miles Simon in [Sim13],
where Ricci ﬂow smoothens out any Lipschitz singularity instantly. Finally, in the
setting of K¨ahler manifolds, Ricci ﬂow has been considered by e.g. Li and Zhang
[LiZh14], which is in strong connection to the exciting recent developments on existence
of K¨ahler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds.

The idea of the proof for both Theorem 1.5 and Theorem 1.6 is to linearize the Ricci
de Turck ﬂow and apply Banach ﬁxed point theorem in appropriate H¨older spaces.
This uses strongly the mapping properties of the heat operator for the Lichnerowicz
Laplacian, which diﬀer strongly when the Lichnerowicz Laplacian acts on trace-free
symmetric two-tensors and when it acts on pure trace tensors and reduces to the scalar
Laplace Beltrami operator.

This paper is organized as follows. We begin with the analysis of the Lichnerowicz
Laplace operator in §2 and construct a solution to its heat equation as a polyhomo-
geneous conormal distribution on a blown up heat space. In §4 we establish various
mapping properties of the heat operator for the Lichnerowicz and the Laplace Beltrami
operators. We employ these mapping properties to establish existence of a solution to
the Ricci de Turck ﬂow in §5 and show in §6 that this ﬂow is indeed a ﬂow of admissible
incomplete edge metrics. Then §7 explains how to pass from the Ricci de Turck solution
to the corresponding solution of the Ricci ﬂow, along with a change in regularity. In §8
we show that the Riemannian curvature tensor of the Ricci de Turck ﬂow is bounded
for positive times, an aspect which will be crucial in subsequent maximum principle
arguments. We conclude this paper with a long time existence result in §9 for Ricci
ﬂow of metrics that are suﬃciently small perturbations of Ricci ﬂat edge metrics.

2. Laplacians on symmetric 2-tensors over an exact cone

In this section we study the rough and the Lichnerowicz Laplace operators acting
on symmetric 2-tensors over an exact cone C (F ) := (0, 1) × F with an exact conical
metric dx2 + x2gF . We provide explicit formulae and formulate assumptions that are
necessary for the subsequent analytic arguments.

2.1. The rough Laplacian on symmetric 2-tensors. Consider for the moment any
Riemannian manifold (M, g) of dimension m. We will specify M to be an exact cone
C (F ) only later on in the argument. Let L denote any vector bundle associated to
T ∗M, for instance the bundle S of symmetric trace-free 2-tensors Sym2
0(T ∗M). Let
∇ denote the induced Levi-Civita connection acting on smooth compactly supported
sections as

∇ : C∞0 (M, L) → C∞0 (M, L ⊗ T ∗M),
∇2 : C∞0 (M, L) → C∞0 (M, L ⊗ T ∗M ⊗ T ∗M).

The rough Laplacian ∆ acing on smooth compactly supported sections of L is then
deﬁned as follows. Consider the pointwise inner product on ﬁbres of L, induced by
the Riemannian metric g on M. Let {ei}m
i=1 denote a local orthonormal frame of T M,
where m is the dimension of M. Then the rough Laplacian ∆ is given by

(2.1)

∆ := −

eiei ≡ −tr(∇2).
∇2

mXi=1

Fix any point p ∈ M and deﬁne a family of distance spheres Sx(p) := {q ∈ M |
distM (p, q) = x}, where the distance distM is deﬁned canonically in terms of the Rie-
mannian metric g, and x > 0 is suﬃciently small. In case M is a conical manifold and
p is chosen as the cone tip, the distance sphere Sx(p) is simply the cross section of the
cone at distance r from the singularity.

We specify the local orthonormal frame {ei}m
i=1 in a neighborhood of p adapted to the
i=2 =
i=2 are tangent to Sx(p) of unit length. One computes by using normal coordinates

distance spheres, such that e1 = ∂x is the normal unit vector ﬁeld at Sx(p), and {ei}m
at any given point q of Sx(p) (we employ the Einstein summation convention)

(2.2)
where Hx(q) denotes the mean curvature of the submanifold Sx(p) ⊂ M at q. The
mean curvature of distance spheres behaves asymptotically as Hx(q) = (m−1)
x + O(x) as
x → 0, cf. [CLN06, Exercise 1.122]. Let X and Y denote any two smooth vector ﬁelds
on M, and consider any ω ∈ C∞0 (M, S). Recall the fundamental geometric relation

∇beibei(q) = −Hr(q)∂x,

{bei}m

∇2
X,Y ω = ∇X (∇Y ω) − ∇∇X Y ω.

Consequently we compute using ∇∂x∂x = 0 and the Einstein summation convention

We now specify M to be an exact cone C (F ) := (0, 1)× F with an exact conical metric
dx2 + x2gF . Then one chooses p as the conical tip and obtains an explicit formula for
the rough Laplacian on C (F ) by (cf. [GMS12, page 47])

(2.3)

∆ = −∇∂x∇∂x −

In case of L is the bundle of symmetric covariant 2-tensors on the exact cone C (F ),
we consider ω ∈ Sym2(ieT ∗C (F )) and set ωxx := ω(∂x, ∂x), ωxα := ω(∂x, x−1∂zα) and
ωαβ := ω(x−1∂zα, x−1∂zβ ). Then one can compute from standard formulae for the

convention)

2.2. The Lichnerowicz Laplacian on symmetric 2-tensors. The Lichnerowicz
Laplacian on symmetric covariant 2-tensors is deﬁned in terms of the rough Laplacian
∆ and additional curvature terms by

(2.5)

∆L := ∆ + 2(Ric − Riem),

where for any symmetric covariant 2-tensor ω on any Riemannian manifold (M, g), with
the corresponding curvature tensor Riem(g) and the Ricci curvature tensor Ric(g), we
have

(2.6)

(Ric ω)ij :=(cid:0)Ric(g)ik gkℓωℓj + Ric(g)jk gkℓωℓi(cid:1) /2,

(Riem ω)ij := Riem(g)ikjℓ gksgℓtωst.

In case of an exact cone, this curvature summand 2(Ric − Riem) reduces to a linear
zeroth order operator acting on the cross section (F, gF ). Its action can be made precise.
With respect to the notation of the previous subsection one computes from deﬁnition

(cid:3)L := −∇∂zα∇∂zα + 2x2(Ric − Riem).

We proceed with an explicit computation of (cid:3)L acting on symmetric trace-free 2-
tensors in the setting of exact conical singularities, that has also been studied explicitly
by Delay [Del06, Lemma 4.2] and Guillarmou, Moroianu and Schlenker [GMS12, 7.4].

Consider a symmetric trace-free 2-tensor ω ∈ Sym2

0(ieT ∗C (F )), trace-free with re-
spect to the exact conical metric dx2 + x2gF . We write ωxx := ω(∂x, ∂x), ω′xα :=
ω(∂x, ∂zα) and ω′αβ := ω(∂zα, ∂zβ ). Note the diﬀerence to the deﬁnition of components
ωxα and ωαβ, which are deﬁned with respect to the vector ﬁelds ∂zα and are written
without an apostrophe. We denote the scalar function ωxx by η, the (1, 0)-tensor (ω′xα)α
by ξ′, and the symmetric 2-tensor (ω′αβ)αβ on the cross section of the cone by h′. Clearly,
our convention is to use greek letters for components corresponding to the cross section
F . Operators and quantities referring to the cross section (F, gF ) of the cone C (F )
are denoted with an additional index F . We compute as in [Del06] and [GMS12] by

The Lichnerowicz Laplace operator acting on trace-free symmetric 2-tensors over an
admissible incomplete edge manifold, equals to the corresponding operator on isolated
cones up to derivatives along the edge and higher order terms. We close the section
with the following

Deﬁnition 2.1. We call an admissible edge manifold (M, g) tangentially stable if for
the corresponding Lichnerowicz Laplace operator ∆L acting on trace-free symmetric
2-tensors the spectrum of the tangential operator (cid:3)L is larger than f = dim F .

2.3. Heat kernel asymptotics of a model operator. Before we proceed with an
asymptotic analysis of the heat kernel for the Lichnerowicz Laplacian ∆L on an admis-
sible edge manifold (M, g), we consider a model operator which already comprises all
the central properties of ∆L. Let us write R+ := (0,∞). Consider for any µ ≥ 0 the

nates (x, y, z) in the singular neighborhood U , which is locally a ﬁbration of cones

operator (cid:3)L into scalar model operators ℓµ with

(2.15)

µ ∈ {λ ≥ 0 | λ2 ∈ Spec((cid:3)L) + (f − 1)2/4} =: E .

Under the assumption of tangential stability in Deﬁnition 2.1, we in particular have µ >
1 so that each direct sum component ℓµ is essentially self-adjoint. Precise description of
their unique self-adjoint domains is classical. However, due to weakness of asymptotic
expansions on edge manifolds, that classical argument is not immediately extendable
to the full operator ∆L in the edge setting. Nevertheless, we can still consider the heat
equation

(∂t + ∆L) ω(t, p) = 0, ω(0, p) = u(p),

and obtain its fundamental solution,
following the heat kernel construction of
[MaVe12], solution as an integral convolution operator acting on compactly supported
sections u by

(2.16)

e−t∆Lu(t, p) =ZM(cid:0)e−t∆L (t, p,ep) , u(ep)(cid:1)g dvolg(ep),

In fact, one can prove a posteriori by following the arguments in Gell-Redmann and
Swoboda [GeSw15, Theorem 4 and Proposition 17] that the Lichnerowicz Laplacian
∆L acting on symmetric two-tensors on an admissible incomplete edge manifold (M, g),
satisfying tangential stability in Deﬁnition 2.1, is essentially self-adjoint and the funda-
mental solution e−t∆L is indeed the corresponding heat operator. This will be explained
below in Theorem 2.4.

The fundamental solution e−t∆L will be a distribution on M 2

values in (ieΛ∗T ∗M ⊗ S) ⊠ (ieΛ∗T ∗M ⊗ S). Consider the local coordinates near the
corner in M 2

h = R+ × fM 2, taking
h given by (t, (x, y, z), (ex,ey,ez)), where (x, y, z) and (ex,ey,ez) are two copies of

RICCI FLOW ON SINGULAR MANIFOLDS

coordinates on M near the edge. The kernel e−t∆L(t, (x, y, z), (ex,ey,ez)) has non-uniform

A = {(t, (x, y, z), (ex,ey,ez)) ∈ M 2
D = {(t, p,ep) ∈ M 2
h | t = 0, p =ep},

h | t = 0, x =ex = 0, y =ey},

which requires an appropriate blowup of the heat space M 2
h , such that the correspond-
ing heat kernel lifts to a polyhomogeneous distribution in the sense of the following
deﬁnition, which we cite from [Mel93] and [MaVe12].
Deﬁnition 2.2. Let W be a manifold with corners and {(Hi, ρi)}N
i=1 an enumeration of
its (embedded) boundaries with the corresponding deﬁning functions. For any multi-
index b = (b1, . . . , bN ) ∈ CN we write ρb = ρb1
N . Denote by Vb(W) the space of
smooth vector ﬁelds on W which lie tangent to all boundary faces. A distribution ω on
W is said to be conormal, if ω is a restriction of a distribution across the boundary faces
of W, ω ∈ ρbL∞(W) for some b ∈ CN and V1 . . . Vℓω ∈ ρbL∞(W) for all Vj ∈ Vb(W) and
for every ℓ ≥ 0. An index set Ei = {(γ, p)} ⊂ C× N0 satisﬁes the following hypotheses:

1 . . . ρbN

(i) Re(γ) accumulates only at +∞,
(ii) for each γ there exists Pγ ∈ N0, such that (γ, p) ∈ Ei for all p ≤ Pγ,
(iii) if (γ, p) ∈ Ei, then (γ + j, p′) ∈ Ei for all j ∈ N0 and 0 ≤ p′ ≤ p.

An index family E = (E1, . . . , EN ) is an N-tuple of index sets. Finally, we say that
a conormal distribution ω is polyhomogeneous on W with index family E, we write
ω ∈ A E

Blowing up submanifolds A and D is a geometric procedure of introducing polar
coordinates on M 2
h, around the submanifolds together with the minimal diﬀerential
structure which turns polar coordinates into smooth functions on the blowup. A de-
tailed account on the blowup procedure is given e.g. in [Mel93] and [Gri01].

First we blow up parabolically (i.e. we treat √t as a smooth variable) the submanifold
h , A] as the disjoint union of M 2
A. This deﬁnes [M 2
h\A with the interior spherical normal
bundle of A in M 2
h, equipped with the minimal diﬀerential structure such that smooth
functions in the interior of M 2
h around A are smooth. The
interior spherical normal bundle of A deﬁnes a new boundary hypersurface − the front
lift to rf (the right face), lf (the left face) and tf (the temporal face), respectively.

new boundary face − the temporal diagonal td. The heat space M 2

The normal operator N(e−t∆L)y0 can now be set up exactly as in [MaVe12, (3.10)] as a
direct sum of the heat kernel for ∆C
L and the heat kernel of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian
on Rb. In order to construct the exact heat kernel, the initial parametrix N(e−t∆L)y0 has
to be corrected, which involves composition of Schwartz kernels on M 2
h . Following the
heat kernel construction in [MaVe12] ad verbatim, we arrive at the following result.

Theorem 2.3. Let (M, g) be an incomplete edge manifold with an admissible edge
metric g. Then the Lichnerowicz Laplacian ∆L acting on symmetric trace-free 2-tensors
admits a fundamental solution e−t∆L to its heat equation, such that the lift β∗e−t∆L is a

Tangential stability introduced in Deﬁnition 2.1 is in fact equivalent to asking that
any µ ∈ E is larger than 1. We conclude the section with a crucial observation that
assuming tangential stability, the Lichnerowics Laplacian ∆L acting on symmetric trace-
free 2-tensors is essentially self-adjoint and the fundamental solution in Theorem 2.3 is
the corresponding heat operator.

Recall that the maximal domain Dmax(∆L) of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian acting
on trace-free symmetric 2-tensors S is deﬁned as the space of ω ∈ L2(M, S) such
that ∆Lω ∈ L2(M, S), understood in the distributional sense. The minimal domain
Dmin(∆L) ⊆ Dmax(∆L) is dual to the maximal domain and is deﬁned as the completion
of compactly supported smooth sections C∞0 (M, S) under the graph norm of ∆L.
Theorem 2.4. Assume that (M, g) is tangentially stable. Then

Dmin(∆L) = Dmax(∆L) =: D(∆L).

In particular, the Lichnerowicz Laplacian ∆L acting on C∞0 (M, S) admits a unique
self-adjoint extension in L2(M, S) given by D(∆L), and the fundamental solution in
Theorem 2.3 is the corresponding heat operator.

Proof. We follow the argument we learned from Gell-Redmann and Swoboda
[GeSw15]. Note that for ﬁxed time t > 0 the Schwartz kernel of the operators e−t∆L
and ∂te−t∆L is square-integrable on M × M. This is due to Theorem 2.3, non-negativity
of the index set E and the fact that for ﬁxed time t > 0 the heat kernel is supported
in M 2
h away from the front face. Consequently, e−t∆L and ∂te−t∆L are both compact,
symmetric and hence self-adjoint.

Denote the smallest element of the index set E by µ0. The operator e−t∆L maps
any ω ∈ L2(M, S) into the space of polyhomogeneous sections in Dmax(∆L) of the

16

BORIS VERTMAN

2

asymptotics O(xµ0− (f −1)
) as x → 0. Take any ω ∈ L2(M, S) and consider any ω′ ∈
Dmax(∆L). Using crucially the fact that µ0 > 1, as well as polyhomogeneity of e−t∆Lω,
we compute similarly to the analysis of minimal and maximal domains for the model
operator ℓµ that

hω′, ∆Le−t∆LωiL2(M,S) = h∆Lω′, e−t∆LωiL2(M,S).

Consequently, e−t∆L maps any ω ∈ L2(M, S) in fact into the minimal domain
Dmin(∆L). Now the purely functional analytic argument given right after the state-
ment of [GeSw15, Theorem 3] yields essential self-adjointness of ∆L. Consequently,
the Lichnerowicz Laplacian admits a heat operator by spectral theorem. That operator
equals the fundamental solution of Theorem 2.3 by [GeSw15, Proposition 13].
(cid:3)

3. Mean value theorem on edge manifolds

The subsequent section on mapping properties of the heat kernel for the Lichnerow-
icz Laplacian requires an estimate of the corresponding H¨older diﬀerences. This will
be somewhat diﬀerent from similar estimates performed in [BaVe14], since the Lich-
nerowicz Laplacian on symmetric 2-tensors does not satisfy stochastic completeness.
Therefore we will use some diﬀerent argument, which is developed in the present section.
We begin with the following consequence of the mean value theorem for Banach-valued
functions of a single variable.
Lemma 3.1. Consider any Banach space B with norm k·k and any η, η′ ∈ R contained
in a compact convex subset K ⊂ R. Assume η ≤ η′. Consider some continuously
diﬀerentiable function ω : K → B. Then for and any ﬁxed odd integer N ∈ N, there
exists a uniform constant C > 0 and some δ ∈ [η, η′] such that

As a consequence of the previous lemma we conclude with the following corollary,
where for simplicity we assume that the edge B as well as the ﬁbre F are one-
dimensional. The general case is discussed ad verbatim.
Corollary 3.2. Consider any continuously diﬀerentiable section ω ∈ Γ(Sym2
lying in the same (convex) coordinate chart as y and y′. Then there exist ξ ∈ (0, 1)
lying in the line segment between x and x′; γ lying in the line segment between y and y′;
and ζ ∈ F lying in the line segment connecting z, z′ ∈ F ; as well as a constant C > 0
depending only on the choice of local coordinate charts and the odd integer N ∈ N, such

4. Mapping properties of the Lichnerowicz heat operator

We continue under the assumption of tangential stability introduced in Deﬁnition
2.1 and study the unique self-adjoint extension of ∆L acting on traceless symmetric
2-tensors ω ∈ Sym2
0(ieT ∗M), where the lower index 0 indices the trace-free property.
We denote its heat operator (as well as the heat kernel) by H. We also ﬁx any δ > 0.
Our main result in this section is the following theorem.

Theorem 4.1. Consider an edge manifold (M, g) with an admissible edge metric g

Proof. We mimic a similar statement in [BaVe14] which is proved using stochastic
completeness for the heat kernel of the Laplace Beltrami operator. We consider here the
Lichnerowicz Laplacian and are not aware of any equivalent of stochastic completeness
on tensors. This requires to some extent strongly diﬀerent analytic arguments. We do
not write out the argument for the third statement, since it follows by repeating the
arguments leading to the second statement ad verbatim.

When performing the estimates we will use Corollary 3.2 and assume just to simplify
notation that F and B are one-dimensional. The estimates in the general case are
performed ad verbatim. Moreover, we will always denote uniform positive constants
appearing in our estimates by C > 0, even though they might diﬀer from estimate to
estimate.

for some uniform constant C > 0. As noted in the explanation after Deﬁnition 1.3, it
suﬃces to take the tuple (p, p′) ∈ M 2 inside the same coordinate patch U of any given
atlas on M. We model our estimates after a similar analysis in [BaVe14]. We begin
by introducing a notation

U+ := {ep ∈ U | dM (p,ep) ≤ dM (p, p′)},
U− := {ep ∈ U | dM (p,ep) ≥ dM (p, p′)}.

Note that over the coordinate patch U the bundle Sym2
0(ieT ∗M) is trivial and the
restriction ω(p) of the section ω to the ﬁbre over p ∈ U can be extended to a constant
function over U. Consequently we may now write

Note that the endomorphism H(·,ep) can be applied to the vector ω(et, p) only forep and

p lying in the same coordinate patch U with the corresponding local trivialization of
the vector bundle Sym2
0(ieT ∗M). This explains why we have separated out the integral
L4. The second term L2 is now estimated exactly as the term I3 in [BaVe14, §3.1]. In
fact the estimates here are even better since the integrand has one order better front

=: L11 + L12 + L13.

Both, L11 and L12 are estimated precisely as the term I1 in [BaVe14, §3.1]. The third
summand L13 is estimated as the term I4 in [BaVe14, §3.1]. We point out that these
estimates hold under the weaker assumption of µ0 > 1. In each of the three cases higher
regularity ω ∈ C2+α

yields a weight √t, as explained before in case of L2.

ie

It remains to estimate the terms L3 and L4 from above. Tangential stability as in
the Deﬁnition 2.1 with µ0 > 1 is used only in the estimate of L3. We begin with the
easier term L4. Recall that for estimating the H¨older norm, we may assume without
loss of generality that the two ﬁxed points p = (x, y, z) and p′ = (x′, y′, z′) lie in the
coordinate neighborhood U. Since the estimates away from the singular neighborhood
U are classical, we may also assume that U ⊂ U . Then we may write (assuming

where (ξ, γ, ζ) is a point on the straight connecting line between (x, y, z) and (x′, y′, z′).

Assume thatep = (ex,ey,ez) ∈ U \U. Then by construction, the distance dB(Y,ey) between
Y andey is uniformly bounded from below for any Y ∈ (y, y′, γ). Consequently, we ﬁnd

for the integrands in the various coordinate systems (2.17), (2.18) and (2.19) that for
some uniform positive constant C > 0 we have

ρ−1

ﬀ = |u|dB(Y,ey)−1 ≤ C|u|, (ρﬀρtd)−1 = |U|dB(Y,ey)−1 ≤ C|U|.

Since the heat kernel is bounded as |u| and |U| tend to inﬁnity, we conclude that each
integrand above vanishes to inﬁnite order at the front and temporal diagonal faces.
Consequently L4 may be bounded in terms of the supremum norm of ω and dM (p, p′)

up to some uniform constant. If ep /∈ U , then the heat kernels in the integrals above

are supported away from the front and temporal diagonal faces in M 2

Let us ﬁrst assume t > t′ and (2t′ − t) ≤ 0. Then t, t′ ≤ 2|t − t′| and we may estimate
the ﬁrst two integrals exactly as J′1 and J′2 in [BaVe14]. For the last two integrals we
h yield additional powers of (√t)α

which in particular implies the required estimate. In fact this additional x weight will be
crucial in the geometric arguments following after the proof of short time existence. (cid:3)

Note that the theorem above does not establish any regularity statement under ap-
plication of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian. In fact, this aspect is somewhat harder and
is the content of the next theorem, where the estimate admits an additional singular
weight in time.

Theorem 4.2. Consider an edge manifold (M, g) with an admissible edge metric g sat-
isfying tangential stability. Consider the index set E in Theorem 2.3, with the minimal
element µ0 > 1. Fix a H¨older exponent α ∈ (0, 1) such that α ≤ µ0 − 1. Then the
Lichnerowicz heat operator deﬁnes a bounded mapping between weighted H¨older spaces4

0(ieT ∗M)).

Proof. For the ﬁrst statement note that the heat kernel H of ∆L commutes with ∆L,
when acting on solutions in the self-adjoint domain of ∆L. This is due to uniqueness
of solutions to the heat equation with initial values in the domain of the Laplacian.
By deﬁnition, C2+α
ie,∆L ⊂ Dmax(∆L) = D(∆L), and consequently, in view of Theorem 2.4,
the ﬁrst statement in this theorem follows the second statement of Theorem 4.1 after
commuting H and ∆L.

It remains to prove the second mapping property. In view of Theorem 4.1, the proof
of which we mimic, it in fact suﬃces to prove that ∆L ◦ H : Cα

ie. The
diﬀerence to the proof in Theorem 4.1 is that instead of adding terms where the heat

ie → √t−1

kernel is integrated against ω(et, p) with p ∈ U ﬁxed, we change the integrals to include

ω(t, p), where the time variable is ﬁxed as well. We will not write out the estimates of
the supremumsnorm, which follow along the lines of the estimate of J in Theorem 4.1
without any singular weighting.

As before, we assume that B and F are of dimension one, just in order to simplify
notation in the estimates; and denote all uniform positive constants by C > 0 even if
the constants change from estimate to estimate.

4Using Corollary 3.2 one can improve the singular t−

for some uniform constant C > 0. As in the previous Theorem 4.1, for the H¨older
estimates it suﬃces to take p and p′ inside the same coordinate patch U, which trivializes
the bundle Sym2

0(ieT ∗M). Moreover, for p and ep lying both in U, the endomorphism

H(·,ep) can be applied to the vector ω(·, p). Consequently we may now write
∆LHω(p, t) − ∆LHω(p′, t)

Since the estimates away from the singular neighborhood U are classical, we may also
assume that U ⊂ U . The ﬁrst term A is then estimated exactly as the terms L1 and L2
in Theorem 4.1 above, following the corresponding arguments in [BaVe14]. The last
term D equals the term L4 from Theorem 4.1, and is estimated accordingly. It remains
to estimate B and C. In order to estimate B, we separate the integration region U into
two parts (not to be confused with the same notation used in Theorem 4.1)

The term B decomposes accordingly as follows

U+ := {ep = (ex,ey,ez) ∈ U |ex ≤ dM (p, p′)},
U− := {ep = (ex,ey,ez) ∈ U |ex ≥ dM (p, p′)},

Since ω ∈ Cα
ie, it suﬃces to estimate R1, R2 and R3 instead of the full expression for
C. The estimates of P1 and Q1, Q2, Q3 as well as R1, R2, R3 are performed as before
using asymptotic analysis of the heat kernel near the front face of the blowup space.
For brevity we omit the estimates of Q′1, which follow along the lines of the estimates
for P1. We will also assume x < x′ without loss of generality, otherwise just rename
the variables.

In the estimates of the various integrals, both dM (p,ep)α and |t −et|

J1 in [BaVe14, §3.2]. The third term S3, like K3 in Theorem 4.1, is estimated exactly
as the term J2 in [BaVe14, §3.2]. It remains to estimate the term S4 where for some

We conclude the section with stating the mapping properties for the Laplace Beltrami
operator ∆ acting on smooth functions over M. Note that this notation was previously
reserved for the rough Laplacian on tensors. However, the rough Laplacian does not
arise as an individual operator in the arguments below, so there will be no point of
confusion and we denote by ∆ the Laplace Beltrami operator on functions from now
on. We identify ∆ with its Friedrichs self-adjoint extension. Under stronger assumptions
other than admissibility of the edge metric, mapping properties of the heat operator
have been established in the joint work of the ﬁrst author with Bahuaud [BaVe14,
Theorem 3.2]. In particular, we have proved there

ie(M × [0, T ]).

However, we do not wish to impose assumptions from [BaVe14] here, since they might
require scaling the metric on ﬁbres, which might destroy tangential stability. With-
out these stronger assumptions, repetition of the arguments in the proof of [BaVe14,
Theorem 3.2] yields the following result.

Let us conclude with an observation on an improved regularity with respect to edge
derivatives. Recall the higher order H¨older spaces introduced in (1.5), which require
regularity with respect to additional application of edge derivatives Ve. Application of
edge derivatives to polyhomogeneous functions on M 2
h does not change the asymptotic
expansions at the left, right and the front face. In fact, it only aﬀects the expansion of
the polyhomogeneous functions at the temporal diagonal, where an integration by parts
argument as in §4.3.4 can be applied to deal with the decrease in the temporal diagonal
asymptotics. Consequently, an ad verbatim repetition of the arguments above extends
Theorems 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 to the setting of these higher H¨older spaces as follows.

Theorem 4.4. Consider an edge manifold (M, g) with an admissible edge metric g

5. Short time existence of the Ricci de Turck flow

We proceed with the explicit analysis of the Ricci ﬂow of an admissible (α, k)-H¨older
regular incomplete edge metric g, satisfying tangential stability introduced in Deﬁnition
2.1. A particular consequence of the diﬀeomorphism invariance of the Ricci tensor is the
well-known fact that the Ricci ﬂow is not a parabolic system. This analytic diﬃculty is
overcome using the standard de Turck trick with the background metric chosen as the
initial incomplete edge metric g ∈ Sym2(ieT ∗M).

Writing the ﬂow metric as (g + v) with v ∈ Sym2(ieT ∗M) and v(0) = 0, we can
follow the linearization of the Ricci de Turck ﬂow as e.g. in Bahuaud [Bah10, 4.2] and

38

BORIS VERTMAN

obtain a quasilinear parabolic system for v ∈ Sym2(ieT ∗M), where all indices refer to
the metric and curvature terms as tensors on ieT ∗M. Let Ric(g) and R(g) denote the
Ricci and Riemannian (4, 0) curvature tensors, respectively. Then the Ricci de Turck
ﬂow can be written as

(5.1)

(∂t + ∆L)vij = (T1v)ij + (T2v)ij + (T3v)ij,
(T1v)ij = ((g + v)kl − gkl)(∇k∇lv)ij,
(T3v)ij = (g + v)−1 ∗ (g + v)−1 ∗ ∇v ∗ ∇v,
(T2v)ij = −2Ric(g)ij + Q(g + v)kl(g + v)ipgpqR(g)jkql)

+ Q((g + v)kl(g + v)jpgpqR(g)ikql),

where Q(∗) is obtained by taking a linear formal expansion of (∗) in v and picking those
terms that are at least quadratic in v. Moreover, ∆L and ∇ denote the Lichnerowicz
Laplacian and the Levi Civita covariant derivative, respectively, both deﬁned with
respect to the initial metric g and acting on Sym2(ieT ∗M).

We decompose v = ug ⊕ ω into pure trace and trace-free parts with respect to
the initial metric g. The Lichnerowicz Laplacian ∆L respects the decomposition since
trg(∆Lv) = ∆(trg(v)) and ∆(ug) = (∆u)g, where ∆ on the right hand side of the latter
equation is the Laplace Beltrami operator of g acting on functions.

We also note the following useful expansion as in [Bah10, (4.1)]

(g + v)ab ≡ ((1 + u)g + ω)ab =

Let us assume for the moment that we are in the special case of isolated conical singu-
larities and ∆L = ∆C
L (up to higher order terms) near the cone tip of the cone C (F ).
Note that in this setting, if the lower index a refers to the radial coordinate x, then ∇a
acts on Sym2
0(ieT ∗M) as a combination of derivatives x−1 Ve and x−1 times a smooth
function on M , smooth up to the boundary. If the lower index a refers to tangential
coordinates z, then ∇a acts on Sym2(ieT ∗M) as a combination of derivatives Ve and
smooth functions on M . On the other hand, any upper index a referring to the radial
coordinate x contributes no singular x factor due to the structure of the inverse met-
ric g−1, while an upper index a referring to the tangential coordinates z contributes a

where O1(∗) and O2(∗) refers to any at least linear and at least quadratic combination of
the term (∗) in the brackets, respectively. In each of the summands we do not indicate
notationally further factors which include just bounded combinations of smooth (up to
the boundary) functions, u and ω, with at most edge V 2
e derivatives. Counting singular
x−1-factors as before we obtain

where in case of T2(v) we used the fact that components of the Riemannian curvature
(4, 0) tensor of an edge metric of bounded geometry are O(x−1) as x → 0, when acting
on ieT M.

In order to pass from the setting of isolated conical singularities to the general setting
of admissible edge singularities, we consider local coordinates (x, y, z) and deﬁne the
local coordinates v := y/x away from the edge {x = 0}. Note that ∂v = x∂y, so that
(u) can be treated in the same way as the tangential coordinates (z). Consequently,
if the lower index a refers to the coordinates in (v), ∇a acts on Sym2(ieT ∗M) as a
combination of derivatives Ve and in particular ∂v = x∂y ∈ Ve. On the other hand, if
the upper index a refers to a coordinate in (v), it contributes a factor x−1 as before for
the tangential variables. We conclude that the expansions of T1, T2 and T3 continue to
hold unchanged in the general setting of admissible edge singularities.

We decompose the Ricci curvature into the trace free component scal(g)

m g and the
trace-free part of the Ricci curvature tensor Ric′(g). Summarizing our analysis from
above we now obtain under the direct sum decomposition into pure trace and trace free
components (with respect to the initial edge metric g) the following structure of the

Theorem 5.1. Consider an admissible H¨older regular edge manifold (M, g) satisfying
tangential stability introduced in Deﬁnition 2.1. Then the Riemannian metric g may be
evolved under the Ricci de Turck ﬂow as g(t) = (1 + u) ⊕ ω within the Banach space H
on some ﬁnite time interval [0, T ]. Here the decomposition g(t) = (1 + u) ⊕ ω is into
the pure trace and traceless component with respect to g(0) = g.

Proof. Consider ﬁrst the linearization of the Ricci de Turck ﬂow in (5.2). We want
to establish the target space of F acting on (u, ω) ∈ H. First of all, the Cα
ie H¨older
norm of ∆Lω is weighted with a singular 1/√t factor due to deﬁnition of H. However,
this singular time behaviour is cancelled in the combination u · ∆Lω, since the H¨older
norm of u is weighted with √t, again by the deﬁnition of H. Moreover, in (5.2) each
singular factor x−1 is coupled with O1(ω,Ve ω,V 2
ie by
the deﬁnition of C2+α
. This explains that indeed

e ω), so that the composition is Cα

ie

Solution to the Ricci de Turck ﬂow is by construction a ﬁxed point of Φ. In order to
prove existence of such a ﬁxed point, we restrict Φ to a subset of H and deﬁne

Zµ := {(u, ω) ∈ H | k(u, ω)kH ≤ µ}, µ > 0.

The terms in the linearization (5.2) are either quadratic in (u, ω) or the summands
scal(g) and Ric′(g) depending only on the initial metric. Hence, for µ > 0 suﬃciently
small, Φ satisﬁes the contraction mapping property

kΦ(u, ω) − Φ(u′, ω′)kH ≤ qk(u, ω) − (u′, ω′)kH

with some positive q < 1 for all (u, ω) and (u′, ω′) ∈ Zµ. Taking T > 0 suﬃciently small
ensures that the H-norm of e−t∆scal(g)⊕ e−t∆LRic′(g) is smaller than µ/2 and hence Φ
maps Zµ to itself for µ > 0 suﬃciently small. Here we use the ﬁrst and third mapping
properties in Theorem 4.4. Hence, repeating the argument of [BaVe14, Theorem 4.1]
ad verbatim, the ﬁxed point exists in Zµ ⊂ H.
(cid:3)

We conclude this section with a slight improvement of regularity under application
of additional edge vector ﬁeld deriviatives. Assuming the initial data has a better Ve
regularity, we may apply the heat operator estimates of Theorem 4.4 and set up a ﬁxed
point argument in the higher order H¨older spaces Ck,2+α
. This proves the following
somewhat stronger statement.

In view of the mapping properties established in Theorem 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, as well as

6. Singular edge structure of the Ricci de Turck flow

In this section we explain in what sense the evolved Ricci de Turck metric g(t) remains
an admissible incomplete edge metric. Recall g(t) = (1 + u)g + ω, where g is the initial
admissible edge metric, u ∈ C2+α
0(ieT ∗M))
is a higher order traceless (with respect to g) term. Consider ﬁrst how the conformal
transformation of g into (1 + u)g aﬀects the incomplete edge structure of the metric.
The argument is worked out in [BaVe15] as well.

(M × [0, T ]) and ω ∈ C2+α

(M × [0, T ], Sym2

ie

ie

Choose local coordinates (x, y, z) near the singularity as before. Due to the fact that
an element of Cα
ie must be independent of z at x = 0, we may write u0(y) := u(0, y, z).
Since u ∈ C2+α
ie we may apply the mean value theorem and ﬁnd that x−1(u(x, y, z) −
u0(y)) is bounded up to the edge singularity. Consequently we obtain a partial Taylor
expansion of u as x → 0

u(x, y, z) = u0(y) + O(x).

1

Now we substituteex = (1 + u0)

2 x. For small u0 this deﬁnes a new boundary deﬁning
function, which varies along the edge. Consider the leading order term g of g, which is
given by g ↾ U = dx2 + x2gF + φ∗gB over the singular neighborhood U . We compute
(1 + u)(dx2 + φ∗gB + x2gF ) = (1 + u0)dx2 + φ∗((1 + u0)gB) + (1 + u0)x2gF + O(x)

The key point here is that up to a conformal transformation of the base metric on B,
the leading term of the metric has the same rigid edge structure in the new choice of

= dex2 + φ∗((1 + u0)gB) +ex2gF + O(x).

ω. By the estimate (4.8) and the fact that in that formula one may take X = x−1,

a boundary deﬁning function ex. It remains to study the higher order traceless term
one concludes that ω is of higher order O(x2) = O(ex2), as x (and hence also ex) goes

to 0. Consequently, up to a change of a boundary deﬁning function, g(t) is indeed an
admissible incomplete edge metric in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.1.

7. Passing from the Ricci de Turck to the Ricci flow

The solution g(t) of the Ricci de Turck ﬂow is related to the actual Ricci ﬂow by a
diﬀeomorphism, a meanwhile classical trick of de Turck which we now make explicit,
cf. [CLN06]. We employ the Einstein notational convention for summation of indices
and deﬁne the time-dependent de Turck vector ﬁeld W (t), given in a choice of local
coordinates by the following expression

W (t)i := −gij(t)gpq(t)(cid:0)Γj

pq(g(t)) − Γj

pq(g)(cid:1) ,

42

BORIS VERTMAN

pq(g(t)) and Γj

where Γj
pq(g) denote the Christoﬀel symbols of the Ricci de Turck ﬂow
metric g(t) and the initial admissible edge metric g, respectively. The Christoﬀel sym-
bols are not coordinate invariant and are given in the ﬁxed choice of local coordinates
by

Γj

pq(g) =

1
2

gjm (∂pgmq + ∂qgmp − ∂mgpq) ,

with Γj
pq(g) obviously deﬁned by the same expression with g replaced by g(t). From the
expressions above it is clear that the de Turck vector ﬁeld W (t) is a bounded Cα
ie-regular
combination of vector ﬁelds x−1 Ve. The loss of regularity from C2+α
in the components
of g(t) to Cα
ie regularity in the components of the de Turck vector ﬁeld is is due to single
application of x−1 Ve in the deﬁnition of W (t). Note that we cannot apply a second
x−1 Ve derivative to the coeﬃcients of W (t), since the trace-free component ω ∈ C2+α
in
the ﬂow g(t) = (1 + u)g + ω stays regular if x−1 Ve is applied once, but doesn’t remain
H¨older regular if x−1 Ve is applied twice.

ie

ie

The de Turck vector ﬁeld deﬁnes a one-parameter family of diﬀeomorphisms φ(t) :

M → M by the ordinary diﬀerential equation in the time parameter t ∈ [0, T ]

d
dt

φ(t) = W (t), φ(0) = idM .

Given the Ricci de Turck ﬂow g(t), one obtains a solution g′(t) to the Ricci ﬂow
by setting g′(t) := φ(t)∗g(t). However, for any two vector ﬁelds X, Y , the action
φ∗g(X, Y ) = g(dφ[X], dφ[Y ]) involves additional derivatives applied to components of
the de Turck vector ﬁeld W (t). As explained above, these components are only of Cα
ie
H¨older regularity and hence we cannot deduce any regular behaviour of g′(t) near the
edge a priori.

Fortunately, the estimates (4.8) prove that ω stays bounded even if x−1 Ve is applied
twice, though it need not stay H¨older regular any longer. Same holds now for the
components of the de Turck ﬂow W (t) as a linear combination of the a basis of vector
ﬁelds in x−1 Ve. This proves the following short time existence statement.
Theorem 7.1. Consider an admissible (α, k)-H¨older regular edge manifold (M, g) sat-
isfying tangential stability. Then the Riemannian metric g may be evolved under the
e (M ×[0, T ], Sym2(ieT ∗M)) on some ﬁnite time interval t ∈ [0, T ].
Ricci ﬂow with g′ ∈ Ck
Here Ck
e denotes the space of k-times diﬀerentiable continuous sections, bounded up to
the edge, which stay bounded up to the edge under application of k-times Ve-derivatives.

8. Evolution of the Riemannian curvature tensor along the flow

In this section we prove that the Riemannian curvature tensor of the Ricci ﬂow metric
g′(t) is bounded along the ﬂow for t ∈ (0, T ] when starting at an admissible H¨older
regular edge manifold (M, g) with bounded Riemannian curvature. More precisely we
prove the following theorem.

Theorem 8.1. Consider an admissible H¨older regular edge manifold (M, g) satisfying
tangential stability. Consider the Ricci de Turck ﬂow solution g(t) = (1 + u)g + ω with

RICCI FLOW ON SINGULAR MANIFOLDS

43

ω traceless with respect to g. Denote the Riemannian curvature tensor of g(t) and g by
R(g(t)) and R(g), respectively. Then the (4, 0) tensor acting on ieT M

R(g(t)) − (1 + u)R(g)

is bounded. In particular, boundedness of R(g) implies boundedness of R(g(t)). Simi-
larly, boundedness of the Ricci curvature Ric(g) of the initial metric implies boundedness
of the Ricci curvature Ric(g(t)) along the ﬂow.

Proof. We will only write out the argument for the Riemannian curvature tensor. The
argument for the Ricci curvature tensor is similar. Recall the following transformation
rule for the Riemannian curvature tensor under conformal transformations

(8.1)

R(e2φg) = e2φ(cid:18)R(g) −(cid:20)g ∧(cid:18)∇∂φ − ∂φ · ∂φ +

1

2k∇φk2g(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:19) ,

where ∧ refers to the Kulkarni-Nomizu product here. Setting e2φ := (1+u), we conclude
from the regularity properties of u ∈ C2+α
(M × [0, T ]) that R((1 + u)g) − (1 + u)R(g)
is indeed bounded, in fact with Cα
ie H¨older regular coeﬃcients. Now consider the full
solution g(t) = (1 + u)g + ω with the higher order term ω. Then, R((1 + u)g + ω) −
R((1 + u)g) is an intricate combination of u and ω, involving their second order x−2 Ve
derivatives. As before in §7, ω is O(x2) as x → 0 and stays bounded up to the edge
2 by (4.8). Consequently, R((1+u)g +ω)−R((1+
singularity under application of x−2 Ve
u)g) is bounded up to the singularity, which proves the statement in view of (8.1). (cid:3)

ie

2

The Riemannian curvature tensor of the Ricci ﬂow metric g′ = φ∗g(t) is related to
the curvature tensor of g(t) by R(g′(t)) = φ∗R(g(t)). Given boundedness of R(g(t)) we
conclude boundedness of R(g′(t)). Assuming as before higher regularity of the initial
data under Ve derivatives, yields a higher regularity in Ck
e spaces for the Riemannian
curvature tensor.

9. Small perturbation of Ricci flat edge metrics

Let (M, h) be a Ricci-ﬂat admissible (α, k)-H¨older regular edge manifold satisfying
tangential stability. We deﬁne when an incomplete edge metric is an ε-close higher
order perturbation of h.

Deﬁnition 9.1. An incomplete edge metric g on M is said to be an ε-close higher
order perturbation of h, if kg − hkh = O(x2) as x → 0 and the H¨older norm of (g − h)
in the weighted H¨older space x2 Ck,2+α

is smaller or equal to ε > 0.

ie

Note that such a higher order perturbation g of an admissible edge metric h with

kg − hkh = O(x2) as x → 0, is automatically admissible as well.

We study Ricci ﬂow of g, and in slight diﬀerence to §5 apply the Ricci de Turck trick
with h as a background metric. This leads to the linearized parabolic equation (cf.

Theorem 9.2. Let (M, h) be a Ricci-ﬂat admissible edge manifold satisfying tangential
stability and the ﬁrst condition of Deﬁnition 1.4. There exists ε > 0 suﬃciently small
such that if g is an ε-close higher order perturbation of h, then the Ricci de Turck ﬂow
g(t) with h as background metric and g(0) = g as initial condition exists inside the
Banach space5

for all times t > 0. Moreover there exists µ(ε) > 0 suﬃciently small, with µ(ε) → 0
as ε goes to zero, such that the H¨older norm of (g(t) − h) in Hk is smaller or equal to
µ(ε), uniformly in time t ∈ [0,∞).
Proof. The Ricci de Turck ﬂow g(t) with h as background metric and g(0) = g as initial
condition exists is a ﬁxed point of the following map

Ψ : (u, ω) ∈ Hk 7→(cid:0)e−t∆ ⊕ e−t∆L(cid:1) ∗ F (u, ω) +(cid:0)e−t∆ ⊕ e−t∆L(cid:1) (g − h) ∈ Hk,

where ∗ refers to the action of the heat operators with convolution in time, and κ :=
(cid:0)e−t∆ ⊕ e−t∆L(cid:1) (g − h) uses the heat operators applied without time convolution. Note
that κ ∈ Hk since the estimates behind the mapping properties stablished in Theorem
4.4 can be carried over ad verbatim to the action of heat operators without convolution
in time under the assumption that (g−h) is bounded in x2 Ck,2+α
. In fact, the additional
weight in x2 Ck,2+α
accounts for the loss of the measure dt in the integral action of the
heat operators without convolution in time.

In order to prove existence of a ﬁxed point for Ψ, we restrict Ψ to a subset

Zµ := {(u, ω) ∈ Hk | k(u, ω)kHk ≤ µ}, µ > 0.

The terms in the linearization (9.1) are all quadratic in (u, ω), since the Ricci curvature
terms of h vanish. Hence, for µ > 0 suﬃciently small, Ψ satisﬁes the contraction

mapping property

kΦ(u, ω) − Φ(u′, ω′)kH ≤ qk(u, ω) − (u′, ω′)kH

ensures that the Hk-norm of(cid:0)e−t∆ ⊕ e−t∆L(cid:1) (g − h) is smaller than µ/2 and hence Ψ

with some positive q < 1 for all (u, ω) and (u′, ω′) ∈ Zµ. Taking ε > 0 suﬃciently small
maps Zµ to itself for µ = µ(ε) > 0 suﬃciently small. Hence, repeating the argument of
[BaVe14, Theorem 4.1] ad verbatim, the ﬁxed point exists in Zµ ⊂ Hk. Note that µ
can be taken smaller the smaller we choose ε.

Note that in contrast to Theorem 5.1, we do not need to restrict to a ﬁnite time
interval [0, T ] with T > 0 suﬃciently small and set up the ﬁxed point argument in the
H¨older space Hk for all times. This is due to the fact that all terms in the linearization
of the Ricci de Turck ﬂow (9.1) are at least quadratic and hence Φ maps Zµ to itself for
µ > 0 suﬃciently small without additional restrictions on time. This is also the reason
why the H¨older norm of (g(t) − h) in Hk is bounded by µ uniformly for all times. (cid:3)
