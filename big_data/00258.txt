A new concept realizing giant spin Nernst effect in nonmagnetic metallic ﬁlms is introduced. It is based on
the idea of engineering an asymmetric energy dependence of the longitudinal and transverse electrical conduc-
tivities, as well as a pronounced energy dependence of the spin Hall angle in the vicinity of the Fermi level by
the resonant impurity states at the Fermi level. We employ an analytical model and demonstrate the emergence
of a giant spin Nernst effect in Ag(111) ﬁlms using ab-inito calculations combined with the Boltzmann approach
for transport properties arising from skew scattering off impurities.

Within the past few years, the ﬁeld of spin caloric transport
has attracted broad interest owing to new challenges and vistas
in applications which combine spintronic as well as thermo-
electric concepts [1]. In this ﬁeld, thermal gradient is used
as an ultimate agent to generate a spin current, in analogy
to the generation of a charge current in conventional thermo-
electrics. As a promiment spincaloritronics phenomenon, the
relativistic spin Nernst effect (SNE) enables a way to generate
a pure transverse spin current in a sample subject to an applied
temperature gradient [2–4]. The SNE bears an analogy to the
spin Hall effect (SHE) [5, 6], which has become one of the
most efﬁcient ways of generating spin currents in spintronics.
Owing to the fact that the SHE has been successfully observed
in various types of experiments [7–9], it is expected that the
spin Nernst effect would also be detectable. However, limita-
tions on the magnitude of temperature gradients in metals can
diminish the magnitude of the spin Nernst currents [10].

Ab-initio studies [11–14] and experiments [15] suggest that
the extrinsic SHE induced by the skew-scattering off impu-
rities can be large due to a large difference in the spin-orbit
coupling strength of the impurities and the host. However,
this argument is not applicable to the SNE, because the ther-
mal transport coefﬁcients entering the expression for the spin
Nernst conductivity (SNC) are determined to a ﬁrst approx-
imation by the derivative of the conductivities around the
Fermi energy (EF), and not by the their values directly at it.
As a consequence, the SNE is more sensitive to changes in the
electronic structure as a function of energy, as compared to the
SHE. A requirement for the SNC to be large is that the energy
dependence of the conductivities should be very asymmetric
with respect to EF.

Recently, Tauber et al. [10, 16], using ﬁrst-principles tech-
niques combined with Boltzmann approach, computed the
SNE in Cu bulk, caused by spin-dependent scattering off
substitutional impurities such as Ti, Au, Bi. The magni-
tude of the SNC was predicted to be about 16 (A/K m) at
300 K in Cu0.99Au0.01 alloy.
It corresponds to a spin cur-
rent of about 10 µA when using a sample with the dimen-
sions of 100×100×100 nm [9] and a temperature gradient of
50 K/µm [17]. For the same Cu(Au) alloy, Wimmer et al.
obtained a somewhat larger value of the SNC of 30 (A/K m)

at 300 K using an ab-initio approach based on Kubo formal-
ism [18]. Although these works suggest that the correspond-
ing magnitude of the spin current is large enough, it has not
been detected so far. Therefore, ﬁnding systems with much
larger SNE is essential for realizing the effect in experiments
and utilizing it in devices.

In this work, we propose a new concept for engineering
a giant spin Nernst effect in nonmagnetic metallic ﬁlms by
means of resonant impurity scattering. Previous work of Fert
and Levy [19] showed a strong inﬂuence of resonant scatter-
ing on the spin Hall effect. Here we demonstrate that the in-
ﬂuence of resonant scattering on the spin Nernst effect can be
also remarkable. Namely, we analytically ﬁnd that scattering
off sharp resonant impurity states at surfaces of metallic ﬁlms
leads to a strong asymmetric energy-dependence of longitudi-
nal charge and transverse spin Hall conductivities, as well as
of the spin Hall angle. As a result, the spin Nernst conduc-
tivity is shown to be gigantic in a wide range of temperatures.
Based on ab-initio calculations we demonstrate the validity of
our ﬁndings by taking Ag(111) ﬁlms with adatom impurities
as a test system. We show that the magnitude of the SNC in
this system can exceed the values reported so far by one or-
der of magnitude. The formulated concepts could be used to
generate large transverse spin currents with temperature gra-
dients.

We start by summarizing the expressions we use to compute
the SNC in thin metallic ﬁlms [10, 18], and then discuss the
conditions for enhanced SNE. The cartesian axes are chosen
such that z-axis is always the ﬁlm normal. In fcc (111) ﬁlms,
x- and y-axes are chosen to be along [1¯10] and [¯10¯1] crystal-
lographic directions. The temperature gradient ∇T is applied
along the x-axis, while we look at the spin current propagating
in y-direction with the spin-polarization along the z-axis. We
deﬁne the spin Nernst conductivity αSN from the spin current
density js

y according to

js
y = αSN ∇xT.

Eq. 3, necessary condition for having large transport coefﬁci-
tents and large SNC is the asymmetry of σq(s)

the Fermi level.

However, as follows from Eq. 2, if σq

yx have a sim-
ilar energy dependence, the electrical αE and the thermal αT
contributions will have an opposite trend with temperature,
i.e. one increases and the other decreases with increasing tem-
perature. As a consequence, this will give rise to a small total
SNC. To show this we deﬁne the energy-dependent spin Hall
angle (SHA) as αSH(E) = σs
xx(E). The opposite
sign of the αE and αT can be then recast as the SHA being

yx(E)/σq

nearly constant in energy, αSH(E) = αSH

0 , with

as follows from Eq. 3. Thus, it immediately follows that

αE = (1/T ) αSH

(5)

We can therefore conclude that strong variation of the SHA in
the vicinity of the Fermi level is a necessary condition for αE
and αT enhancing each other’s contribution to the total SNC.
A possible scenario to realize a non-trivial energy depen-
dence of the SHA as well as manifestly asymmetric energy
dependence of the charge and spin conductivities could be by
scattering off resonant impurity states positioned around the
Fermi level. As it was pointed out by Fert and Levy [19],
resonant scattering off d-impurities can enhance the spin Hall
effect. We apply their model for SHE in terms of the energy
dependence of the SHA, to the spin Nernst effect. Fert and
Levy’s expression for the SHA reads:

αSH(E) =

(6)

where λd = 2/5(E5/2 − E3/2) is the splitting between the
d5/2 and d3/2 impurity levels, ∆ is the width of the reso-
nance, η1 is the phase shift of non-resonant channels and η2
is the phase shift of resonant channels. Phase shift η1 can be
assumed to be energy-independent since it changes very little

around the Fermi level. The phase shift η2 is strongly energy-
dependent and can be evaluated according to:

(cid:19) , (7)
with its Fermi energy value η2(EF ) = πZd/10, where
Zd is the number of occupied impurity d-states. The lon-
gitudinal charge conductivity is evaluated as σxx(E) ∝
1/sin2(η2(E)), and the transverse spin conductivity is related
to it by σs

yx(E) = σxx(E) · αSH(E).

At this point, we use ﬁrst-principles calculations based
on the relativistic full-potential Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (FP-
KKR) Green function method [20, 21] for accessing the spin-
dependent scattering off adatom defects at surfaces of metallic
ﬁlms. The particular system that we choose to investigate is
a 10-layer thick Ag(111) ﬁlm. The energy-dependent longi-
tudinal charge and transverse spin Hall conductivities due to
scattering off impurities entering Eq. 3 are calculated using
the Boltzmann approach [11, 22, 23]. The scattering rates as
well as the conductivities are calculated at a nominal impurity
concentration of 1% per surface unit cell. At ﬁrst, we con-
sider two types of defects: Cr and W impurities at the adatom
site positioned on the surface of Ag(111) ﬁlm. To have a gen-
eral comparison between Cr and W, Cr is considered as non-
magnetic defect in this work. Our ab-initio calculations for
the density of states (DOS) of the impurities show that while
Cr DOS exhibits a very sharp resonant feature at EF , the DOS
of W defects has a wider spread around the Fermi level, see
Fig. 1(b). For these two cases, we proceed both with analytical
and ﬁrst principles evaluation of the SNE, as outlined above.
To estimate key parameters in the model of Fert and Levy,
we take from experiment the values for λd of 0.032 eV for Cr
and 0.38 eV for W [24]. From the shape of the ab-initio DOS,
Fig. 1(b), we estimate the resonance width ∆ to be 0.49 eV
for Cr and 1.3 eV for W impurities. To estimate the phase
shift of non-resonant channel, we calculate αSH at EF as a
function of η1 according to Eq. 6, with the result shown in
Fig. 1(a). It can be seen that the maximum value of αSH(EF )
is reached when η1 = η2 = πZd/10 with Zd = 4, and it
can be nearly 30% for W, with a much smaller value of only
4% for Cr. Using the computed from ﬁrst-principles value of
αSH(EF ) of 3.5% both for W and Cr impurities at the surface
of a 10-layer Ag(111) ﬁlm, Fig. 1(d), we ﬁnd that η1 = 0.47π
for Cr defects, which is much larger than the corresponding
η1 = 0.05π for W defects. This is probably a consequence
of the similar extension of the non-resonant s-states in the W
impurities compared to the Ag host.

We are ready now compute the energy dependence of the
spin Hall angle around the Fermi energy using the model of
Fert and Levy as given by Eq. 6 [25]. It is shown in Fig. 1(c)
for Cr and W impurities on top of 10-layer Ag(111) ﬁlm,
while in Fig. 1(d) the corresponding ﬁrst-principles calcula-
tions are shown. In Fig. 1(c) one can clearly see that scatter-
ing off sharp resonant states of Cr gives rise to a very drastic
variation of the SHA around the Fermi level, even accompa-
nied by a sign change according to ab-initio results. On the

other hand, the predicted behavior of the SHA in the case of
W impurities is much smoother in energy. The difference in
the qualitative trend of the SHA between Cr and W defects,
as captured within the model, is relatively well reproduced by
ﬁrst principles results.

xx(E) and σs

Next, following Eq. 3, we integrate σq

yx(E) to
obtain the transport coefﬁcients and compute the electrical αE
and thermal αT parts of the SHE, as given by Eq. 2, as a func-
tion of temperature. The corresponding contributions, as well
as their sum comprising the total SNC, are shown for Cr and
W defects as determined from model [Fig. 1(e, g)] and ab-
initio calculations [Fig. 1(f, h)]. As is immediately clear from
these plots, the model predictions qualitatively agree with the
corresponding ﬁrst principles results in terms of relative mag-
nitude of αE and αT , as well as their trend with temperature.
Namely, for Cr impurities, due to the pronounced variation of
the SHA around EF , the electrical and thermal parts of the
SNE have the same sign, magnitude and trend with increasing
temperature. The two contributions are thus added up to re-
sult in a very large SNC reaching as much as 250 (A/K m) at
around 150 K. In contrast, even though the two contributions
in W case separately acquire values as large as those for Cr
defects, they suppress each other owing to their opposite sign.
We can thus attribute the small magnitude of the total SNC of
about 50 (A/K m) in this case to the smooth behavior of the
SHA with energy around the Fermi level. Overall, the results
are in direct accordance to the mechanism for enhanced SNE
we formulated above.

To demonstrate the emergence of large SNE due to the res-
onant scattering off impurities as a general phenomenon, we
consider the case of the p-type impurity Pb and the d-type

magnetic impurity Zr deposited on the surface of a 10-layer
Ag(111) ﬁlm. In Fig. 2, where the ﬁrst principles calculations
for Pb and Zr impurities are shown, we observe that the DOS
of Pb p-states exhibits a peak at the Fermi level, related to res-
onant scattering of host electrons. This gives rise to a drop in
the SHA as the Fermi energy is crossed. The asymmetry in
the SHA here is due to the asymmetric behavior of the spin
Hall conductivity, while the energy-dependence of the longi-
tudinal charge conductivity is rather symmetric around EF .
As a result, the total SNC is dominated by the thermal contri-
bution αT of about 200 (A/K m) at 300 K, with the electrical
contribution αE basically remaining negligible in the entire
interval of considered temperatures. When Pb impurities are
replaced by Tl impurities with one electron less (not shown),
the resonant peak is shifted far away from the Fermi level.
As a consequence, αE and αT contributions become opposite
in sign, which signiﬁcantly suppresses the overall SNC in the
entire temperature range.

We also ﬁnd a large spin Nernst effect for a Ag(111) ﬁlm
with magnetic Zr surface adatom defects, see Fig. 2. In this
case, the majority-spin states of Zr are positioned directly at
the Fermi level, which leads to an asymetric behavior of the
SHA as a function of energy owing to resonant scattering. It is
remarkable that, although our calculations predict a tiny mag-
nitude of the spin Hall angle of the order of 0.02%, the sys-
tem exhibits a large SNC reaching as much as 115 (A/K m)
at room temperature. This serves as a perfect demostration
of the fact that the SNE has little to do with the magnitude
of the spin Hall effect. In turn, this suggests that the material
base for the large spin Nernst effect can be completely dif-
ferent from that explored currently experimentally for large
SHE. We also have to stress that Zr impurities exhibit ﬁnite
magnetic moments taken to be in the out-of-plane direction
in our calculations, and that, correspondingly, a part of the
spin Nernst conductivity is driven by the anomalous Nernst
effect. In fact, our calculations indicate a very large variation
of the anomalous Nernst angle with energy, resulting also in a
pronouced anomalous Nernst conductivity [26].

To estimate the magnitude of the spin current generated by
the spin Nernst effect with the total SNC αtot of the order of
200 (A/K m) at room temperature, which is the case for Ag
ﬁlms with Pb and Cr impurities at the surface, in analogy to
Ref. [10], we assume a sample size of 100×100 nm and an
applied temperature gradient of 50 K/µm. These parameters
give us a value of the spin current of about 100 µA. This is one
order of magnitude larger than that obtained for bulk Cu(Au)
alloy in Ref. [10] by using the same computational approach.
Our observation that resonant scattering can lead to a giant
SNE should have consequences in the presence of Kondo im-
purities at low temperature. It is well known that the Kondo
resonance is very sharp [27]. Following the arguments pre-
sented here, Kondo impurities may strongly enhance the spin
Nernst conductivity, just as they do with the thermopower
[28, 29]. However, its many-body-ﬂuctuation character places
the Kondo effect beyond the reach of density-functional meth-
ods that we use in the present work.

4

To summarize, we demonstrated the possibility of drastic
enhancement of the spin Nernst effect due to resonant impu-
rity scattering taking place at surfaces of metallic ﬁlms. As
shown from a model and ﬁrst principles calculations, the pres-
ence of the resonant impurity states around the Fermi level re-
sults in a pronouncedly asymmetric behavior of longitudinal
and/or spin Hall conductivites with energy, leading to large
electrical and thermal contributions to the SNC. The reach-
able magnitude of the corresponding spin current that we pre-
dict opens new vistas in exploring the promises that the spin
Nernst effect bares for spintronics applications.
