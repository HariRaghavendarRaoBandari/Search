We show that the anomalous diﬀusion equations with a fractional derivative in the Caputo or
Riesz sense are strictly related to the special convolution properties of the L´evy stable distributions
which stem from the evolution properties of stretched or compressed exponential function. The
formal solutions of these fractional diﬀerential equations are found by using the evolution operator
method where the evolution is conceived as integral transform whose kernel is the Green function.
Exact and explicit examples of the solutions are reported and studied for various fractional order of
derivatives and for diﬀerent initial conditions.

The Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts functions (the KWW

functions or stretched exponentials) [1, 2]:

and 0 < α < 1,

[3–8]. It has been shown, e.g.

with τ0 an eﬀective time constant, have been broadly ob-
served in a variety of complex materials and systems as
supercooled liquids, spin glass, amorphous solids, molec-
ular systems, glass soft matter, porous and noncrystals
silicon, etc.
in [9], that
the KWW function is related to the Cole-Cole relax-
ation processes which appear in the systems of disordered
or anomalous structures. The KWW function has been
measured in biological applications, e.g. in protein fold-
ing [10], in a photo-switchable peptide tracked [11, 12]
etc. The similar exponential behavior can be also ob-
served for α > 1 [13–15]. This case is called the com-
pressed exponential, which in the theory of slow mag-
netization is named the Kolmogorov-Avrami-Fatuzzo re-
laxation [13–15].

From the theoretical point of view fα(t/τ0) for 0 < α <
1 and 1 < α < 2 are respectively relevant to the one-sided
or two-sided L´evy stable distribution [16, 17], which are
in turn related to the anomalous (the so-called sub- or
super-diﬀusion) diﬀusion equations. The physical situa-
tion is described by the Fokker-Planck equation with the
fractional derivative usually of Riemann-Liouville, Ca-
puto or Riesz type. The case of α = 2 is matched with
the standard diﬀusion equation. For α ≡ N = 3, 4, 5 . . .
the compressed exponential functions correspond to the
partial diﬀerential equation with the space derivative of
order N [18, 19]. The sub- and super-diﬀusion equa-
tions are usually derived via the probability approach like
the continuous-time random walks [20], the master equa-
tion [21], the generalized master equation [22], and re-
lated methods [23–25]. Nevertheless, the anomalous dif-
fusion equations should stem from the natural evolution
property which is satisﬁed by fα(t/τ0), namely a prod-
uct of two stretched (compressed) exponential functions
should give another stretched (compressed) exponential
function. From the mathematical point of view, the use
of the complex analysis technique underlying this condi-
tion will allow us to obtain the fractional Fokker-Planck
equations. This alternative approach to a derivation of
the anomalous equations and the operational method of
solving them are the main objectives of this work. We
believe that this will open new possibilities of looking at
the stretched and compressed exponentials which have in

the natural way built-in the anomalous behavior.

given by one-sided L´evy stable distributions [16]:

2

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we recall
and comment on two relations: the ﬁrst is between the
stretched exponential and the one-sided L´evy stable dis-
tribution, and the second one is between the compressed
exponential and two-sided L´evy stable distribution. We
use the well-known unique relation between the one- and
two-variables L´evy stable distributions whose evolution
property will be study in the paper. In Sec. II we derive
two types of integral evolution equations related to two
various behaviors of fα(t/τ0). The diﬀerential version of
these equations will be found in Sec. III. In connection
with the used L´evy stable distribution they will contain
the fractional derivative in the Caputo or Riesz sense.
The solution of these diﬀerential equations in terms of
the Green function are given in Sec. IV. Sec. V is de-
voted to ﬁnding the solution of these equations with the
help of operational methods based on the integral trans-
forms whose kernels are given by the appropriate L´evy
stable distributions. Sec. VI contains the explicit exam-
ples of solutions of the equations. We conclude the paper
in Sec. VII.

II. L ´EVY STABLE DISTRIBUTIONS

In a discrete setting and from a phenomenological
point of view the KWW functions for 0 < α < 1 can
be treated as a sum of weight function of exponential
decays (fα(t/τ0) for α = 1) [26], namely

fα( t

where gα(uj) is a probability density, i.e. gα(uj) > 0 and

Pj gα(uj) = 1, which describes the structure of the sam-

ple where relaxation process is governed by the stretched
exponential function. In the limit of large number of ele-
ments in the sum and for the inﬁnitesimally small changes
∆ui, Eq. (2) goes over the Laplace transform [26–29]

later. Eq. (6) goes to the Dirac δ function, namely δ(u),
in the limit of t → 0, see [32, Eq. (17.13.94) on p. 1115].
gα(( t
)α, x) has the essential singularity at x = 0 [33,
τ0
Eq.

where, similarly to Eqs.
(3) and (4), we use the new

the unique scaling relation

(5)

which presents the one-to-one correspondence between
the one and two variables L´evy stable distributions. This
relation is crucial for our considerations and below we
shall study many of its consequences. Similar relations
appear in studies of related properties of gα(u) reported
in [30, 31].

(12) deﬁnes also
the symmetric L´evy stable distribution for 0 < α < 1
[17, 37]. In the limit of vanishing t the two-sided L´evy
stable distribution goes to the Dirac δ function,
i.e.
˜gα(( t

tion is given in [37, Eqs. (4) and (5) for l = 2p, k = 2q,

power of x is for p < q and the upper sign in the power
of x is for p > q. For α = 2 we get the Gauss (normal) dis-

tribution, ˜g2((t/τ0)2; x) = τ0 exp[−(xτ0)2/(2t)2]/(4√πt).

For more examples see [37].

From the very natural evolution assumption written for
the stretched (compressed) exponential function for t0 ≤
t1 ≤ t2 it appears that a very speciﬁc composition of two
stretched (compressed) exponentials should give another
stretched (compressed) exponential.
It means that the
appropriate convolution of the stable distributions gives
another stable distribution: (i) for the one-sided L´evy
stable distribution of two variables we have

The proofs of Eqs.
(14) and (15) are given in Ap-
pendix A. We remark that Eqs. (14) and (15) are the
Laplace-like and Fourier-like convolutions, respectively,
where both of the arguments of functions, i.e. t and x,
can change. However, Eqs.
(14) and (15) diﬀer from
the standard Laplace and Fourier convolutions of the one
variable L´evy stable distributions which lead to the sta-
ble laws [38, 39]. For the stretched exponential the stable
law has the form

tion equations whose diﬀerential forms will be found in
the next section.

III. FRACTIONAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
RELATED TO L ´EVY STABLE DISTRIBUTIONS

A. The diﬀerential form of Eq. (14)

We start by rephrasing Eq. (14) for (t2 − t1)/τ0 = T
and inﬁnitesimally small (t1 − t0)/τ0 = ∆T . The r.h.s
of Eq. (14) can be estimated by taking the asymptotics
of gα((∆T )α, x − y) for ∆T ≪ 1. Using Eq. (7), where
instead of exp[−(∆T ξ)αe−iπα] we take its ﬁrst two terms
of its asymptotic expansion, i.e. 1 − (∆T ξ)αe−iπα, we
obtain
gα((∆T )α, x − y) ≃ Im(cid:26)Z ∞

In Eqs. (17) and (18) we employed [40, Eq. (2.3.3.1) on
p. 322]. Substitution of Eq. (19) into Eq. (14) written
for (t2 − t1)/τ0 = T and (t1 − t0)/τ0 = ∆T gives
the r.h.s. of Eq. (14) = Im(cid:26)Z x

The second integral in Eq. (22) is calculated in Appendix

employ the deﬁnition given in Eq. (7).

Next, we calculate the integral in Eq. (21) as follows:
we apply (x − y)−α−1 = 1
dy (x − y)−α, integrate Eq.
(21) by parts and use the deﬁnition of the one-sided L´evy

1. Similarly to the approach presented in the previous
subsection we will estimate the r.h.s. of Eq.
(15) for
inﬁnitesimally small values of ∆T . Employing Eq. (12)
adjusted for ˜gα((∆T )α, x− y) and taking the asymptotic
expansion of exp[−(∆T )α|ξ|α] up to the second term, we
get
˜gα((∆T )α, x − y) ≃Z ∞

In Eq. (34) we have used formulas (1.1) on p. 102 and

of Eq. (15) gives

Setting z − x = δeiϕ and then taking the limit of small
δ we obtain that the integral over closed contour Sδ has
only the real value which is equal to e−xξ. That leads to
vanishing of this integral and consequently to vanishing
Eq. (25). Consequently, Eq. (26) is equal to

which follows from [32, Eq. (8.334.3)] and the fact that
the integral in Eq. (29) is real. That can be shown by
calculating the derivative of gα(T α, y) given in Eq. (7),
inserting it in Eq. (26), changing the order of integration,
and using [32, Eq. (3.381.1) on p. 346].

Expressing the l.h.s.

(14) written for
(t2 − t1)/τ0 = T and inﬁnitesimally small (t1 − t0)/τ0 =
∆T into the Taylor series up to the second term we get

of Eq.

gα((T + ∆T )α, x) ≃ gα(T α, x) + ∂T αgα(T α, x)

× [(T + ∆T )α − T α]
≃ gα(T α, x) + (∆T )α∂T α gα(T α, x),

(30)
(31)

where in Eq. (30) we employed the asymptotics of the
square bracket, namely [(T + ∆T )α − T α] ≃ (∆T )α.
Collecting together all the contributions we obtain that
the right hand side of Eq. (14) for (t2 − t1)/τ0 = T and
(t1− t0)/τ0 = ∆T , where ∆T ≪ 1, has the form speciﬁed
below:

∂T αgα(T α, x) = − C∂α

(37)
which is in analogy to Eq. (31). Substituting Eqs. (37),
(35) and (36) into Eq. (15) with (t2 − t1)/τ0 = T and
inﬁnitesimally small (t1 − t0)/τ0 = ∆T we obtain

IV. THE GREEN FUNCTION METHOD

We recall the fundamental facts about the propagator
and the Green function, compare [41]. We consider the
diﬀerential equation in the form

where n − 1 < α < n and f (n)(y) = dn

dyn f (y).

B. The diﬀerential form of Eq. (15)

Let us now ﬁnd the diﬀerential form of Eq. (15) for
(t2 − t1)/τ0 = T and (t1 − t0)/τ0 = ∆T such that ∆T ≪

h(y, x) =Z K(y, x; y′, x′)h(y′, x′)dx′.

(40)

The function K(y, x; y′, x′) is a propagator related
to Eq.
(39) which is an response of the system on
the given initial (or boundary) conditions which are
the Dirac δ functions. The propagator K has the

(∂y − ˆO)K(y, x; y′, x′) = 0;

(i) K(y, x; y, x′) = δ(x − x′);
following properties:
for
(ii)
y0 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 the propagator satisﬁes K(y2, x2; y0, x0) =
R K(y2, x2; y1, x1)K(y1, x1; y0, x0)dx1, which is
the
Laplace convolution for the one-sided L´evy stable dis-
tribution and the Fourier convolution for the two-sided
L´evy distribution.

and (iii)

K(y, x; y′, x′) can be used to deﬁne the Green function

G(y, x; y′, x′), which fulﬁlls

(∂y − ˆO)G(y, x; t′, x′) = δ(x − x′)δ(y − y′).

(41)

The relation between the propagator and the Green func-
tion is given by

G(y, x; y′, x′) = Θ(y − y′)K(y, x; y′, x′)

+ AK(y, x; y′, x′),

(42)

where Θ(y − y′) is the Heaviside step function and A is
a constant.

A. The Green function of Eq. (32)

In this subsection we will ﬁnd the Green function rel-
evant to Eq. (32) and denoted by G(T α, x; ˜T α, ˜x). For
that purpose we solve Eq.
x and
y = (t/τ0)α ≡ T α by taking twice the Laplace transform
of this equation and applying [32, Eq. (17.13.95) on p.
1115]. The twofold use of Laplace transform, one in T α
(T > 0) and another one in x (x > 0) gives

LhLh(∂T α + C∂α

x )G(T α, x; ˜T α, ˜x); τi ; κi = e−τ ˜T α

(43)
where T > ˜T . The Laplace transform of the ﬁrst
derivative with respect to T α is proportional to τ ,
i.e. L[∂T α G(T α, x; ˜T α, ˜x); τ ] = τ GLτ (τ, x; ˜T α, ˜x). Sim-
ilarily the Laplace transform of the fractional deriva-
tive in the Caputo sense of G(T α, x; ˜T α, ˜x) is given
by καGLκLτ (τ, κ; ˜T α, ˜x) − κα−1G(T α, ˜x; ˜T α, ˜x), see [42,
Eq.
The
symbols Lτ and Lκ denote the Laplace transforms
to time T α and space x such that
with respect
GLκLτ (τ, κ; t′, x′) = L[L[G(T α, x; ˜T α, ˜x); τ ]; κ]. Assum-
ing that G(T α, ˜x; ˜T α, ˜x) = 0, we get

80 for 0 < α < 1].

In Eq. (45) we have applied [27, Eq. (3-3-11) on p. 146
of vol. 2] and the deﬁnition of the one-sided L´evy stable
distribution. Comparing Eqs.
(45) and (42) we have
A = 0 and

K(T α, x; ˜T α, ˜x) = Θ(x − ˜x)gα(T α − ˜T α, x − ˜x)

(46)

with gα(T α − ˜T α; x − ˜x) given in Eq.
(6). From the
properties of the one-sided L´evy stable distribution it
can be seen that the propagator K satisﬁes properties
(i), (ii) and (iii) which are listed at the beginning of this
Section. The property (ii) can be easily shown to hold
by demonstrating that the Laplace transform L[(∂T α +
x )Θ(x − ˜x)gα(T α − ˜T α; x − ˜x); κ] vanishes. It comes
C∂α
from [27, Eq. (3-3-11) on p. 146] and [42, Eq. (2.140) on
p. 80]. The property (iii) is proven in Appendix A.

B. The Green function of Eq. (38)

The Green function ˜G(T α, x; ˜T α, ˜x) for T > ˜T which is
the solution of Eq. (38), i.e. Eq. (41) with ˆO = − R∂α
|x|
and y = (t/τ )α ≡ T α, can be obtained by taking the
Laplace transform in T α for T > 0 and Fourier transform
[36] in x for x ∈ R:
FhLh(∂T α − R∂α
(47)
The Fourier transform of the fractional derivative in the
Riesz sense is equal to −|κ|α, see [45, Eq. (1.17)] and
[43]. Thus, Eq. (47) reads

) ˜G(T α, x; ˜T α, ˜x); τi; κi = e−τ ˜T α

|x|

.

˜GFκLτ (τ, κ; ˜T α, ˜x) =

e−τ ˜T α
τ + |κ|α ,

(48)

where ˜GFκLτ (τ, κ; ˜T α, ˜x) = F [L[ ˜G(T α, x; ˜T α, ˜x); τ ]; κ].
After calculating the inverse Laplace transform and then
the inverse Fourier transform of ˜GFκLτ (τ, κ; t′, x′), we get

˜G(T α, x; ˜T α, ˜x) = F−1[L−1[ ˜GFκLτ (τ, κ; ˜T α, ˜x); T α]; x]

= F−1[Θ(T α − ˜T α)e−T α|κ|α
= Θ(T α − ˜T α)˜gα(T α − ˜T α, x − ˜x).

; x]

(49)

GLκLτ (τ α, κ; ˜T α, ˜x) =

e−τ ˜T α

e−κ˜x

,

(44)

Thus, the Green function G(T α, x; ˜T α, ˜x) can be obtained
by taking twice the inverse Laplace transform of Eq. (44):

G(T α, x; ˜T α, ˜x) = L−1[L−1[GLκLτ (τ, κ; ˜T α, ˜x); T α]; x]

= L−1hΘ(T α − ˜T α)e−κ˜xe−(T α− ˜T α)κα
= Θ(x − ˜x)Θ(T α − ˜T α)gα(T α − ˜T α, x − ˜x). (45)

; xi

The two-sided L´evy stable distribution ˜gα(T α− ˜T α, x− ˜x)
is deﬁned in Eq. (12). Comparison of Eq. (49) with Eq.
(42) indicates that A = 0 and propagator ˜K is given by

˜K(T α, x; ˜T α, ˜x) = ˜gα(T α − ˜T α, x − ˜x).

(50)

We stress that the properties of ˜gα(T α, x) imply that the
requirements (i)-(iii) are satisﬁed for ˜K deﬁned in Eq.
(50). For example, the property (ii) follows from [27, Eq.
(2-3-8) on p. 39 of vol. 1] and [45, Eq. (1.17)].

V. THE EVOLUTION OPERATOR METHOD

A. The case of Eq. (32)

From the mathematical point of view, Eq. (32) with
the initial condition h(x) is the Cauchy-like problem. Its
formal solution for x > 0 and 0 < α < 1 can be expressed
via evolution operator ˆUα(T ) in the following way

gα(T α, x) = ˆUα(T )h(x) = exp(−T α C∂α
gα(T α, ξ)h(x − ξ)dξ,

=Z ∞

0

x )h(x)

(51)

(52)

The second equality in Eq. (51) has a symbolic meaning
which suggests naively employing a series representation
of ˆUα(T ). This series representation does not constitute
an eﬀective tool because the series obtained usually con-
verges for ﬁxed T only and for special values of initial
conditions. The use of integral representation, see Eq.
(52), for an established domain of ˆUα(T ) avoids the prob-
lem of convergence and opens the new way of ﬁnding and
obtaining the mathematically correct solutions.

The integral kernel gα(T α; x), given in Eqs.

(7)
(52) for the ini-
and (8), is a special solution of Eq.
It is also the propagator
tial condition h(x) = δ(x).
K(T α, x; ˜T α, ˜x) for ˜T = 0 and ˜x = 0. Eq.
(52) for
h(x) = gα(0; x) reconstructs the convolution property
Eq. (14) for (t2 − t1)/τ0 = T and (t1 − t0)/τ0 = 0. It can
be also shown that for diﬀerent times t0, t1 and t2 such
that t0 ≤ t1 ≤ t2, the evolution operator satisﬁes

ˆUα( t2−t0
τ0

) = ˆUα( t2−t1
τ0

) ˆUα( t1−t0
τ0

).

(53)

which follows from Eq. (14).

Let us now establish the conditions under which Eq.
(52) solves Eq. (32). For that purpose we calculate the
Laplace transform of the both sides of Eq. (32). Thus,
we get

L[∂T αgα(T α, x); κ] = ∂T αe−(T κ)α

= −καe−(T κ)α

,

(54)

where we applied Eq. (3). The r.h.s of Eq. (32), where
we employed Eq. (52) and [42, Eq. (2.140) on p. 80 for
0 < α < 1], reads

L[C∂α

gα(T α, ξ)dξ κα−1h(0)

= καe−(T κ)α

− κα−1h(0).

(55)

If we assume that the Laplace transform of h(x) exists,
i.e. L[h(x); κ] = H(κ), h(0) = 0, and we change the sign

6

like in Eq. (32), then Eq. (55) is equal to Eq. (54). That
implies that gα(t; x) given in Eq. (52) is the solution of
Eq. (32).

The inverse Laplace transform of h(x − ξ), which is
equal to e−ξκL−1[H(κ); x], implies that the formal so-
lution (52) obtained by using the evolution operator
method has also the form:

gα(T α, x) = L−1[e−(T κ)α

H(κ); x],

(56)

which allows one to rewrite gα(T α, x) in terms of the
inverse Mellin transform [27]

gα(T α, x) = M−1(cid:20)Z ∞

where we applied [46, Eq. (2.1)].

B. The case of Eq. (38)

The formal solution obtained via the evolution oper-
ator method of Eq. (38) with the initial condition ˜h(x)
can be presented as

˜gα(T α, x) = ˆVα(T )˜h(x) = eT αR∂α

|x| ˜h(x)
˜gα(T α, ξ)˜h(x − ξ)dξ.

=Z ∞

−∞

(58)

Similarly, like in the case of the operator ˆUα(T ), the in-
tegral representation (58) frees us from using the series
representation of ˆVα(T ) which, even for well-deﬁned ini-
tial conditions, can lead to divergent solutions.

The integral kernel ˜gα(T α, ξ) is the two-sided L´evy
stable distribution, see Eqs. (12) and (13), which is a
special solution of Eq.
(38) with the initial condition
˜h(x) = δ(x).
It is the propagator ˜K(T α, x; ˜T α, ˜x), see
Eq. (50), for ˜T = 0 and ˜x = 0. Eq. (58) reproduces the
convolution property Eq. (15) for ˜h(x) = ˜gα(0, x).
In
analogy to Eq. (53), it can be shown that for t0 ≤ t1 ≤ t2
the condition

ˆVα( t2−t0
τ0

) = ˆVα( t2−t1
τ0

) ˆVα( t1−t0
τ0

)

(59)

is satisﬁed which stems form Eq. (15).

Taking the Fourier transform of both sides of Eq. (38)
with ˜gα(T α, x) deﬁned in Eq. (58) we check that it is the
correct solution of this diﬀerential equation. The Fourier
transform of Eq. (38) gives:

F [∂T α ˜gα(T α, x); κ] = ∂te−T α|κ|α

,
(60)
where we employed Eq. (12). The Fourier transform of

equal to F [˜h(x); κ] = ˜H(κ).

(61) we employed [45, Eq.

VI. EXAMPLES

(A) We start with ﬁnding the formal solution of Eqs.
(32) and (38) for the initial conditions given by the one-
and two-sided L´evy stable distributions, h(x) = gβ(0, x)
and ˜h(x) = ˜gβ(0, x), respectively. If the values of β are
the same as in the integral kernel of Eqs. (52) and (58),
i.e. β = α, then we get the convolution properties Eqs.
(14) and (15) for (t2 − t1)/τ0 = T and (t1 − t0)/τ0 = 0.
For β 6= α the formal solutions given in Eqs. (52) and
(58) are presented in [47].
(B) Eq. (52) for the integral kernel g1/2(√T , ξ) given
by the L´evy-Smirnov distribution and the initial con-
dition h(x) = erf[(2√x)−1] will be solved by using
Eq.
(57), where the function erf(x) denotes the er-
ror function. The Laplace transform of h(x) is ob-
tained by using [48, Eq.
106] and
is equal to H(κ) = κ−1(1 − e−√κ).
Inserting it
into Eq.
(57), employing for the Mellin transform
M[f (x); s] = fM (s) [35, Eqs. (8.4.1.7) and (8.4.1.4) on
p. 531], i.e. M−1[fM (−s); x] = M−1[fM (s); x−1] and
M−1[asfM (s); x] = M−1[fM (s); x/a], we get

VII. CONCLUSION

Appendix A: The derivations of Eqs. (14) and (15)

8

In the paper we have studied the consequence of em-
ploying the convolution properties of two-variable version
of the L´evy stable distribution where both arguments are
changed. The natural evolution requirement imposed on
the stretched or compressed functions allows us to derive
the new types of convolution properties of the L´evy stable
distributions. They are, in fact, the evolution equations
written in the integral form. Next, using the tools of
the complex analysis we derived the diﬀerential forms of
these equations, namely the anomalous diﬀusion equa-
tions with the spacial fractional derivative in the Caputo
or Riesz senses. The Caputo diﬀerential operator is ob-
tained for 0 < α < 1 and x > 0 and it is related to
the one-sided L´evy stable distributions, while the Riesz
operator is obtained for 1 < α < 2 and x ∈ R and it cor-
responds to the two-sided L´evy stable distributions. We
point out that the anomalous diﬀusion equations with the
fractional derivative with respect to space coordinate de-
scribe the behavior of the random walker on a disordered
space who makes the jumps of a length proportional to
x in the time interval from T α to T α + dT α.

We have also proposed the formal solution of the two
kinds of so obtained anomalous diﬀusion equations by
employing the operational method. The integral rep-
resentation of the appropriate evolution operators was
found. Its integral kernels are the L´evy stable distribu-
tions which are given by the Green function connected
with the anomalous diﬀusion equations. That allows us
to deﬁne the self-reproducing solutions. We have also
constructed the classes of the initial conditions for which
our solutions work. Thus, we have shown that the for-
malism of evolution equation and the integral transforms
associated with them are very eﬃcient tools to deal with
evolution problems involving the space-fractional anoma-
lous equations. For various fractional order of deriva-
tives and diﬀerent initial conditions we have presented
some explicit examples of the solutions of space-fractional
anomalous diﬀusion equations with two types of frac-
tional derivatives operators.

We start with the evolution property written for the

The symbol ’◦’ denotes a composition of function which
should be understood as the multiplication of stretched

and making analogical changes of variable like in the case
of Eq. (A2) we get Eq. (15).

Appendix B: Calculation of the second integral in

Eq. (22)

The second integral in Eq. (22) has the simple singu-
larity at y = x, where 0 < x < ∞. Taking the contour
of integration which is the upper quadrant with the pole
at y = x, see Fig. 3, and using the Cauchy’s integral

Observe that Eq. (B3) for θ = π/2 can be estimated by
Im[ψ(iR)] ≤ R(x − R)/(x2 + R2) which it is smaller or
equal to Im[ψ(R)] for 0 < x < R. That leads to
