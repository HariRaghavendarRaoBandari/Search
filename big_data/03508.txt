A TRISECTRIX FROM A CARPENTER’S SQUARE

DAVID RICHESON

Abstract. In 1928 Henry Scudder described how to use a carpenter’s
square to trisect an angle. We use the ideas behind Scudder’s technique
to deﬁne a trisectrix—a curve that can be used to trisect an angle. We
also describe a compass that could be used to draw the curve.

In 1837 Pierre Wantzel famously proved that it is impossible to trisect an
arbitrary angle using only a compass and straightedge [13]. However, it is
possible to trisect an angle if we are allowed to add additional items to our
toolkit.

We can trisect an angle if we have a marked straightedge [7, pp. 185–87],
a Mira (a vertical mirror used to teach transformational geometry) [4], a
tomahawk-shaped drawing tool [11], origami paper [5], or a clock [9]. We
can also trisect an angle if we are able to use curves other than straight
lines and circles: a hyperbola [15, pp. 22–23], a parabola [3, pp. 206–08], a
quadratrix [7, pp. 81–86], an Archimedean spiral [2, p. 126], a conchoid [15,
pp. 20–22], a trisectrix of Maclaurin [10], a lim¸con [15, pp. 23–25], and so
on; such a curve is called a trisectrix. In many cases, we can use specially-
design compasses to draw these or other trisectrices. For instance, Descartes
designed such a compass [1, pp. 237–39].

The literature on diﬀerent construction tools and techniques, new com-
passes, and their relationships to angle trisection and the other problems
of antiquity is vast. A reader interested in learning more may begin with
[1, 6, 7, 8, 15].

In this note we describe a trisection technique discovered by Henry Scud-
der in 1928 that uses a carpenter’s square [12]. Then we use the ideas behind
this construction to produce a new trisectrix, and we describe a compass that
can draw the curve.

1. Angle Trisection Using a Carpenter’s Square

A carpenter’s square—a common drawing tool found at every home im-
provement store—consists of two straightedges joined in a right angle. To
carry out Scudder’s construction we need a mark on one leg such that the
distance from the corner is twice the width of the other leg. For instance,
we will assume that the longer leg is one inch wide and that there is a mark
two inches from the corner on the shorter leg.
Let’s say we wish to trisect the angle ∠AOB in ﬁgure 1. First, we draw a
line l parallel to and one inch away from AO; this can be accomplished using

a compass and straightedge, but a simpler method is to use the long leg of
the carpenter’s square as a double-edged straightedge. We now perform the
step that is impossible using Euclidean tools: Place the carpenter’s square
so that the inside edge passes through O, the two inch mark lies on the
line BO, and the corner sits on the line l (at the point C, say). Then the
inside edge of the carpenter’s square and the line CO trisect the angle. This
procedure works for any angle up to 270◦, although the larger the angle, the
narrower the short leg of the carpenter’s square must be.

Figure 1. A carpenter’s square or a T-shaped tool can be
used to trisect an angle.

In fact, we do not need a carpenter’s square to carry out this construction.
All we need is a T-shaped device (shown on the right in ﬁgure 1) in which the
top of the T is two inches long. It is not diﬃcult to see that this technique
trisects the angle: the right triangles COF , COE, and DOE in ﬁgure 1 are
congruent.

2. A New Compass

We now use the carpenter’s square as inspiration to create a compass to
draw a trisectrix (see ﬁgure 2). The device has a straightedge that is one
inch wide and a T-shaped tool with pencils at both ends of the two-inch top
of the T. The long leg of the T passes through a ring at one corner of the
straightedge. The T can slide back and forth in the ring, and the ring can
rotate. One pencil draws a line along the straightedge. The other pencil
draws the curve we call the carpenter’s square curve.
We use the compass as follows. Suppose we would like to trisect ∠AOB in
ﬁgure 3. Place the bottom of the straightedge along OA with the ring located

at O. Use the compass to draw the straight line l and the carpenter’s square
curve. Say that BO intersects the curve at D. Use an ordinary compass to
draw a circle with center D and a two-inch radius. It will intersect l at two
points. Label the right-most point (viewed from the perspective of ﬁgure 3)
C. Then OC trisects the angle. Use an ordinary compass and straightedge
to bisect ∠COD to obtain the other trisecting ray.

an angle.

3. The Carpenter’s Square Curve

What is this carpenter’s square curve? Does it have a closed form? Is
it algebraic or transcendental? (In [14], Yates used a carpenter’s square
in a diﬀerent way to generate a diﬀerent curve—a cissiod. Yates gives an
algebraic expression for his curve and shows that it can be used to compute
cube roots.)

|CD| = 2, a2 + (1 − y)2 = 4, and hence a =(cid:112)(3 − y)(y + 1). (Notice that

First we introduce x- and y-axes. Let O be the origin and OA be the
positive x-axis (see ﬁgure 4). Let D = (x, y) and C = (x + a, 1). Because
a ≥ 0 throughout the construction.) Also, E is the midpoint of CD, so
E = (x + a/2, (y + 1)/2). Because CD and EO are perpendicular,

(y + 1)/2
x + a/2

= − a
1 − y

.

Substituting our expression for a and simplifying, we obtain

(y − 2)2(y + 1)

x2 =

3 − y

.

This algebraic curve has a self-intersection at (0, 2), and y = 3 is a horizontal
asymptote. However, as we see in ﬁgure 4, our compass does not trace this
entire curve.
