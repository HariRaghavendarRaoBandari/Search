ABSTRACT

We investigate the minimum planet mass that produces observable signatures in infrared
scattered light and submm continuum images and demonstrate how these images can be used
to measure planet masses to within a factor of about two. To this end we perform multi-ﬂuid
gas and dust simulations of discs containing low mass planets, generating simulated obser-
vations at 1.65µm, 10µm and 850µm. We show that the minimum planet mass that produces
a detectable signature is ∼ 15M⊕: this value is strongly dependent on disc temperature and
changes slightly with wavelength (favouring the submm). We also conﬁrm previous results
that there is a minimum planet mass of ∼ 20M⊕ that produces a pressure maximum in the
disc: only planets above this threshold mass generate a dust trap that can eventually create
a hole in the submm dust. Below this mass, planets produce annular enhancements in dust
outward of the planet and a reduction in the vicinity of the planet. These features are in steady
state and can be understood in terms of variations in the dust radial velocity, imposed by the
perturbed gas pressure radial proﬁle, analogous to a trafﬁc jam. We also show how planet
masses can be derived from structure in scattered light and sub-mm images. We emphasise
that simulations with dust need to be run over thousands of planetary orbits so as to allow the
gas proﬁle to achieve a steady state and caution against the estimation of planet masses using
gas only simulations.

INTRODUCTION

Planets form in the dense, rotationally ﬂattened structures of dust
and gas called “proto-planetary disc” (see Williams & Cieza 2011
for a review). Despite the rapid expansion of our knowledge of exo-
planets around main sequence stars (Mayor & Queloz 1995), little
is known about the putative planets that may already be present
in such discs at an age of < 10 Myr. The Atacama Large Mil-
limeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), which is approaching its
full capability, can reach the unprecedented resolution and sensi-
tivity necessary for the detailed characterisation of such discs and
may also be able to detect direct signatures of embedded proto-
planets (see for example the pattern of bright and dark rings ob-
served in HL Tau during a science veriﬁcation campaign which has
been interpreted as being of planetary origin; ALMA Partnership
et al. 2015). The latest near-infrared (NIR) instruments on 8 m-class
telescopes (e.g. Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet RE-
search (SPHERE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) or Gemini
Planet Imager (GPI) on the Gemini Telescope) provide an oppor-
tunity to search for planetary signatures in discs via scattered light

imaging at similar resolution as ALMA in the sub-millimetre. In
the near future similar resolution will be available in the thermal
mid-infrared (MIR) when the 30–40m class telescopes (e.g. the Eu-
ropean Extremely Large Telescope, E-ELT) will come online.

It is very tempting to connect the presence of rings and gaps
in protoplanetary disc images (which might be commonplace, see
Zhang et al. 2016) to the presence of planets. According to conven-
tional core accretion models (Pollack et al. 1996), however, giant
planets are an unexpected outcome at the very young age ascribed
to HL Tau (105 yr; Kenyon & Hartmann 1995). It is however cur-
rently unclear whether this indeed involves a revision of planet for-
mation mechanisms and timescales or whether the structures seen
in the image are not planetary in origin. Our focus here however
is not to add to the debate on this particular system but to present
a more generic exploration of the detectability of planetary signa-
tures via submm and scattered light imaging.

It is often assumed that only giant planets can create structures
in discs prominent enough to be observed (e.g., Varni`ere et al. 2006;
Ruge et al. 2013, 2014). Indeed, it is well known that giant plan-
ets create gaps in the gas disc (Lin & Papaloizou 1979), partially
depleting the surface density in a region as wide as a few times its
Hill radius. Planets with a mass smaller than a critical value, which

2

is typically somewhat lower than the mass of Jupiter, are not able to
open signiﬁcant gaps (Crida et al. 2006), and one might then think
that these objects would not produce observable features in discs.
In this case it would not be possible to put observational constraints
on the formation conditions of the large population of super-Earths
discovered by Kepler around main sequence stars, objects now be-
lieved to constitute the most abundant population of planetary ob-
jects (Howard et al. 2012). This is particularly unfortunate because
whereas it is clear that gas giant planets must form at an evolu-
tionary stage when disc gas is still abundantly present, it is unclear
whether super-Earths originate at similarly early times. Conven-
tionally, terrestrial planet formation is often ascribed to later eras
(age of ∼ 100 Myr) when the disc gas has long since dissipated
and planet building proceeds via planetesimal collisions and gi-
ant impacts among embryos in a gas poor environment (Raymond
et al. 2014). On the other hand, the conventional core accretion sce-
nario for gas giant planet formation (Pollack et al. 1996) envisages
the formation of rock cores within the protoplanetary disc which
only convert to gas giants if they attain a critical mass in excess
of 10-20 Earth masses while gas is still abundantly present. An al-
ternative model for super-Earth formation would therefore involve
the assembly of rock cores during the disc phase, in the case that
cores did not achieve criticality during the gas rich phase. The core
growth rate, and therefore the dichotomy that we observe for exam-
ple in the Solar System between terrestrial and giant planets, might
be due to the location in the disc with respect to the water snow
line (Morbidelli et al. 2015). A conceptually distinct scenario for
super-Earth formation instead invokes photoevaporation from the
central star (on a timescale of ∼ 100 Myr) to erode the gas enve-
lope of a gas giant planet formerly produced in the protoplanetary
disc (Owen & Wu 2013).

Here we explore whether planetary signatures can potentially
be detected in the low mass (super-Earth) regime. This issue has
not received much attention to date since the impossibility of gap
opening at masses much below a Jupiter mass (∼ 300M⊕) im-
plies that low mass planets have only a modest effect on disc gas
distributions. Nevertheless a number of studies have indicated that
planet induced signatures are stronger in disc dust than in the gas,
on account of the tendency of drag-coupled dust to collect in pres-
sure maxima in the disc (Weidenschilling 1977). Such an effect has
been shown to enhance the observability of structures produced by
more massive planets, as dust becomes trapped at the outer edge of
disc gaps ( e.g. Rice et al. 2006; Zhu et al. 2012; Owen 2014).

Paardekooper & Mellema (2004) were the ﬁrst to simulate
dust gaps opened by low mass planets, ﬁnding gaps opening at
resonances. Their simulated ALMA images demonstrated the ca-
pability of ALMA to observe such structures: they found that a
0.05 Mj (15 M⊕) planet opens a gap in the dust while a 0.01 Mj
(3 M⊕) does not, but do not elaborate further on the detectability
threshold. In an extensive work, Zhu et al. (2014) showed that even
a planet with a mass as little as 8 M⊕ can affect the dust surface
density, creating a double gapped structure. However the observa-
tional consequences are not explored in this paper. Moreover this
work considers only inviscid discs and therefore cannot explore the
effect of viscously driven inﬂow in the gas in modifying the resul-
tant dust structures. Dong et al. (2015) focussed on giant planets
and their impact on transitional discs, but they also simulate a 0.2
MJ planet which they ﬁnd is able to open a gap in the dust. They
also ﬁnd that such a low mass planet is not able to affect the spec-
tral energy distribution (SED). To the best of our knowledge their
work is the only one that, when exploring the observational conse-
quences, is not restricted to ALMA wavelengths but also includes

simulated near-infrared (NIR) images. However no study is made
of systematically lowering the planet mass until the observed signa-
tures disappear. In a series of papers, Fouchet et al. (2010) explored
the impact of planets on the dust distributions, but in creating syn-
thetic ALMA observations (Gonzalez et al. 2012) only the gas giant
regime is explored. Even more recently, the HL Tau observations
(ALMA Partnership et al. 2015) prompted other works which have
focussed on explaining the ring structure that was observed. Dip-
ierro et al. (2015) interpreted the image using three planets, ﬁnding
a best ﬁt with masses of 0.2, 0.27 and 0.55 Mj. Picogna & Kley
(2015) also interpreted the HL Tau image in terms of planets, but
in this case only two planets are invoked (with best ﬁt masses 0.07
and 0.35 Mj). The authors also commented that, depending on the
disc parameters, they ﬁnd observable gaps even assuming masses
of 10 and 20 M⊕. Finally, Jin et al. (2016) also interpreted the im-
age using three planets, but with best ﬁt masses of 0.35, 0.17 and
0.26 Mj.

The above works have shown convincingly that there is a
prospect for observing low mass planets in discs. However, as we
have highlighted, no work so far has directly established what is
the minimum planet mass that creates observable features at high
resolution with current instruments (or those planned for the near
future). In addition, most of the effort has concentrated on ALMA
and very little attention has been dedicated to scattered light im-
ages, which however have the same resolution as ALMA. Finally,
to the best of our knowledge, the literature contains no predictions
of this kind for MIR thermal images; with the upcoming genera-
tion of 30m class telescopes, images at these wavelengths will in
a few years have the same resolution as existing sub-mm and NIR
instruments. The goal of this paper is to remedy this omission by
deriving a threshold for the observability of a planetary gap in pro-
toplanetary discs at NIR, MIR and submm wavelengths, as well as
studying the dependence of this threshold on disc properties.

This paper is structured as follows. We present our method in
section 2 and the results from the multi-ﬂuid simulations in section
3. We then present the simulated observations in section 4. Section
5 discusses our results and we draw our conclusions in section 6.

2 NUMERICAL METHOD AND INITIAL CONDITIONS

Our methodology consists of running 2D multi-ﬂuid gas dust simu-
lations of planet disc interactions. We then post-process the simula-
tions by calculating synthetic observations at three different wave-
lengths (NIR, MIR and sub-mm).

2.1 Gas and dust dynamics

We run 2D multi ﬂuid simulation where we evolve at the same time
the dust and the gas using the FARGO-3D code (Ben´ıtez-Llambay
et al. 2015). FARGO uses the ZEUS numerical algorithm (Stone &
Norman 1992). The algorithm is well tested and it has been used
many times for proto-planetary disc studies (see de Val-Borro et al.
2006 for an algorithmic comparison). We extended the code to in-
clude dust, approximating the dust as a pressureless ﬂuid that is
coupled to the gas via linear drag forces. We have neglected feed-
back from the dust onto the gas. These approximations are valid for
low dust-to-gas ratios and particles with Stokes number (see next
paragraph) St < 1 (Garaud et al. 2004).

The equation for the dust velocity, (cid:126)vd, is given by

diffusive velocity (cid:126)vD = (cid:126)FD/ΣD to the velocity at which the dust
is advected during the transport step.

2.2 Initial conditions and parameters

For the viscosity we use the α prescription of Shakura & Sunyaev
(1973) assuming α = 10−3. We use 2D cylindrical coordinates and
dimensionless units in which the orbital radius of the planet (rp) is
at unity, the unit of mass is that of the central star, while the unit
time is the inverse of the Kepler-frequency of the planet. The inner
radial boundary of our grid is at 0.5 rp and the outer boundary at
3rp; we use non reﬂecting boundary conditions at both boundaries.
The resolution is 450 and 1024 uniformly spaced cells in the radial1
and azimuthal direction, respectively. We let the disc relax for a
time t0 of 10 orbits before introducing the planet, and then, to avoid
numerical artefacts, we increase the mass of the planet from zero
to the ﬁnal one over a time ttaper of 20 orbits, according to the
formula sin2(π/2×(t−t0)/ttaper). The planet is kept on a circular
orbit whose orbital parameters are not allowed to vary. The surface
density proﬁle is given by:

Σ(R) = Σ0

rp
R

,

(4)

where the value of the normalisation constant Σ0 is arbitrary as far
as the dynamics is concerned. In our ﬁducial model the disc has an
aspect ratio H/R at the location of the planet of 0.05. The aspect
ratio varies in a power-law fashion with a ﬂaring index of 0.25. The
value of the aspect ratio is particularly important as it controls the
strength of the pressure forces, which are responsible (see section
3.1) for closing the planetary gap. For this reason we also run mod-
els with a different value of the aspect ratio. We chose values of
0.025 (“cold”) and 0.1 (“hot”) that encompass the possible range
of variation in real proto-planetary discs.

For the ﬁducial model, we

run simulations with different
planet masses, considering values of 8, 12, 20, 60, 120 M⊕. Note
that as far as the dynamics is concerned only the ratio of the planet
mass to the star mass matters; the planet masses we quote assume a
central mass of 1 M(cid:12), and need to be properly rescaled with the star
mass. When varying the aspect ratio of the disc, we also run models
for additional values of the planet mass, as the aspect ratio controls
how massive a planet must be to signiﬁcantly affect the surface den-
sity of the disc. For the “cold” disc case (H/R = 0.025) we also
run models for a mass of 2.5 M⊕, and for the “hot” disc case for
masses of 96, 160, 480 M⊕.

Along with the gas dynamics we integrate in time the evo-
lution of the dust. To keep our simulations scale-free, we ﬁx the
Stokes number St of the grains rather than their physical size. Once
the physical scales of the disc have been chosen, it is then possible
to convert our Stokes numbers to real sizes as we explain in the next
section. We use 5 dust sizes, with Stokes numbers (logarithmically
spaced) ranging from 2 × 10−3 to 0.2.

2.3 Radiative transfer

To investigate the detectability of dust gaps opened by low mass
planets we calculate images at various wavelengths using the 3D
radiative transfer code RADMC-3D2. In the radiative transfer calcu-
lation we use a 3D spherical mesh with Nr=256, Nθ=180, Nφ=384

1 While this gives a different relative resolution across the grid, the limited
range in radii of our grid does not make the effect signiﬁcant.

Figure 1. Radial velocity of the dust in a 2D disc for a range of Stokes
Numbers. The velocity from the simulation (points) agrees well with the
analytical solution (solid lines, Takeuchi & Lin 2002).

where (cid:126)vg is the gas velocity, (cid:126)ad are the non-drag accelerations felt
by the dust, and ts is the stopping time. It is common to introduce
the dimensionless stopping time, also called Stokes number, de-
ﬁned as St = tsΩk, where Ωk is the keplerian angular velocity at
the given location in the disc. We solve this equation along with
∂t + ∇ · (Σd(cid:126)vd) = 0, using the ZEUS
the continuity equation ∂Σd
algorithm, in which the forces (source step, RHS of Eqn. 1) are
evaluated prior to the advection (transport step, (cid:126)vd ·∇ (cid:126)vd term). The
transport step for the dust is identical to that of the gas. For details,
see Stone & Norman (1992), Masset (2000) and references therein.
The source step for the dust is evaluated semi-implicitly, us-
ing the analytical solutions available for the simple form of the
drag law. We take into account the change in gas velocity over the
time-step by approximating (cid:126)vg as (cid:126)vg(t(cid:48)) = (cid:126)vg(t) + (cid:126)ag × (t(cid:48) − t)
throughout the time step, where (cid:126)ag is the acceleration calculated
explicitly ( that is, at time t) during the source step for the gas. The
dust velocity at t + ∆t is given by
(cid:126)vd(t + ∆t) = (cid:126)vd(t) exp(−∆t/ts) + (cid:126)ag∆t

+ [(cid:126)vg(t) + ((cid:126)ad − (cid:126)ag)ts] (1 − exp(−∆t/ts)),

(2)
which reproduces the explicit update when ∆t (cid:28) ts and the short
friction time limit when ∆t (cid:29) ts. To see this, consider (cid:126)ad = (cid:126)g and
(cid:126)ag = − ∇P
+ (cid:126)g, where (cid:126)g is the gravitational acceleration and P is
the gas pressure. For ∆t (cid:29) ts

∆t = C∆x/ max(|vd|,|vd − vg|), where we use a conservative
value of C = 0.44 for both the gas and dust. We have veriﬁed the
technique using a range of tests. For example, Fig. 1 shows the code
achieves good agreement between the radial velocity obtained in a
low resolution (Nr × Nφ = 350 × 580) 2D simulation and the
analytical solution (Takeuchi & Lin 2002).

Additionally, mass diffusion was added to the surface density
in the dust using a Schmidt number Sc = 1. The diffusive mass

cosity (Clarke & Pringle 1988), was included by adding an effective

grid points in the radial, poloidal and azimuthal direction, respec-
tively. For the radial direction we use a logarithmic grid extending
from 1 au to 100 au while an arithmetic grid is used for the an-
gular coordinates. To ensure that we resolve the disc properly in
the vertical direction we place Nθ = {10, 160, 10} points in the
[0, π/2 − θ0], [π/2 − θ0, π/2 + θ0], [π/2 + θ0, π] intervals, re-
spectively, where θ0 = 5H/R, H/R being the aspect ratio of the
disc taken at the outer edge of the disc.

The disc density distribution for a given grain size a is as-

(5)

where Σa(R, φ) is the dust surface density, R = r sin θ and
z = r cos θ and H(R) is the pressure scale height. For the lat-
ter we use the same value, as a function of radius, as is assumed in
the hydrodynamic simulations. The dust surface density of the disc
is taken from the hydrodynamic simulation in the following way.
First we take both the gas and dust surface density from the hy-
drodynamic simulations and bilinearly interpolate them to the spa-
tial grid used in the radiative transfer calculations. We extrapolate
the disc both inwards and outwards of the hydrodynamic computa-
tional domain3 if it is necessary assuming that Σ(R) ∝ R−1. Then
we calculate the gas density structure using Eq. (5). As our hydro-
dynamics simulations are not 3D, we did not include dust settling
or iterated to reach hydrostatic equilibrium. Including these effects
properly would require including also other 3D effects which are
potentially more important, which goes beyond the scope of this
paper (see the discussion in section 5.3). Neglecting settling is par-
ticularly relevant for the sub-mm dust; however we note that, given
that it is optically thin, observations mostly probe the dust surface
density, and at sub-mm wavelengths are not really sensitive to the
details of the vertical structure. In addition, while settling might
change the global temperature of the disc, this would result only
in a global change of the surface brightness, whereas here we are
interested in the sub-structure present in the image. The same argu-
ment can be applied to another inconsistency that stems from our
approach, namely that the temperature assumed for the hydro cal-
culation might be different from the one computed by RADMC-3D.
Also, we remark that such inconsistencies always arise when us-
ing parametric models; the beneﬁt is that they allow us to set up a
controlled environment.

The dimensionless surface density provided by FARGO-3D is
converted to dimensional form taking the planetary orbital radius to
be 30 AU and normalising the density such that the gas mass in the
disc is 0.01 M(cid:12) within 100 AU. The corresponding normalisation
of the gas surface density at 1 AU is ∼ 300 g cm−2. For what
concerns the dust, we normalise the density so that the initial dust
to gas ratio is 10−2. We use 10 logarithmically spaced grain size
bins between 0.1 µm and 1 mm and assume that the dust grain size
distribution follows dN/da ∝ a−3.5.

Then for a given dust grain size we calculate the Stokes num-
ber in the disc midplane, assuming that the particles are in the Ep-
stein regime:

dust, which we assume to be 3.6 g/cm3, ρg is the density of the gas
and Σg the surface density of the gas. To arrive at the last expres-
sion we have used the fact that Σg = ρgH and H = cs/Ω; note
that in these equations we have neglected factors of order unity. At
any given location in the disc we perform a linear interpolation in
Stokes number to compute the dust surface density, starting from
the results of our hydrodynamical simulations. When the Stokes
number is smaller than the smallest one we have in the multi-ﬂuid
simulation we assume that the dust follows the gas. We note that
with our parameters the typical Stokes number of 1 mm particles at
30 AU is ∼ 0.07 and ∼ 0.17 at 100 AU, which ensures that we have
enough information from the multi-ﬂuid simulations to reconstruct
the surface density of those particles.

The mass absorption coefﬁcients of the dust grains are calcu-
lated with Mie-theory using the optical constants of astronomical
silicates (Weingartner & Draine 2001). The radiation ﬁeld of the
central star is modelled with blackbody emission and the star is as-
sumed to have parameters, typical for a Herbig Ae star4, M(cid:63)=2 M(cid:12),
Teﬀ = 9500 K, R(cid:63)=2.5 R(cid:12).

As a ﬁrst step, we calculate the temperature of the dust with
a thermal Monte Carlo simulation, then we calculate images at
1.65 µm, 10 µm and 880 µm taking the disc inclination to be 10◦.
We use 1.6·108 photons and 9 · 107 photons for the thermal Monte
Carlo simulations and for the image calculations, respectively.

depth of the gap still slowly evolves over a timescale of (cid:39) 103
planetary orbits, over which the depth typically changes of a factor
< 2. This result is consistent with what other authors have found
previously when looking at the timescale of gap opening(Varni`ere
et al. 2004; Duffell & MacFadyen 2013; Fung et al. 2014) and can
be understood in terms of the timescale to reach gap opening be-
ing roughly the viscous timescale across the gap. For reference, if
we assume that the perturbed region has a width ∆ of few scale-
heights: ∆ = xH (with x a constant with a value of a few), we ﬁnd
that the timescale for gap opening is x2/(2πα) ∼ 150x2 orbits.
Crida et al. (2006) found that instead the relative surface density
proﬁle, i.e. 1/Σ dΣ/dr, is established on a much faster timescale.
While the gas evolution has few observational implications in it-
self, we ﬁnd that the dust can change more signiﬁcantly over this
time-scale. In particular, the dust is sensitive to the pressure pro-
ﬁle of the gas. If the planet is massive enough, it creates a pressure
maximum in the gas that will trap dust (Rice et al. 2006), as we
detail in section 3.3. The location of this maximum has therefore a
deep impact on the dust structure and we ﬁnd that it reaches con-
vergence after the stated time interval. We show in Figure 3 the
evolution with time of the location of the pressure maximum for
an illustrative case of a planet of 480M⊕ in the “hot” disc, that is,
H/R = 0.1. We choose this disc because the viscous time-scale
in this disc is faster than for the other aspect ratios, which allows
us to explore more the evolution in time of the pressure maximum.
The curve (blue line) can be ﬁtted with an exponential (green line)
with a tapering timescale of ∼ 370 orbits; the value that the ex-
ponential tends to is almost indistinguishable from the value after
3000 orbits. For the ﬁducial model, an exponential convergence is
not so clear and the curve can be ﬁtted equally well by a logarithm.
Assuming that we can rescale the time scale with (h/r)2, we can
estimate the error in the location of the pressure maximum in the
ﬁducial model that is introduced by only running for 3000 orbits
to be 0.2 H, by estimating the error for the “hot” case if we had
stopped after 750 orbits. Even for the “cold” case, the error is less
than H. We remark that current observational facilities are not able
to resolve a scale height in discs at a distance of 30 AU from the
star, so that our estimates are accurate enough for observational ap-
plications. In what follows we choose then to present our results
after 3000 orbits.

Figure 4 shows the azimuthally averaged surface density of the
gas for the ﬁducial model after 3000 planetary orbits. In ﬁgure 4 it
can be seen that there is little modiﬁcation to the gas surface density
for the least massive cases. The 120M⊕ planet produces a gap that
involves a reduction in surface density by a factor 10; the 60M⊕
one produces a partial gap that involves a reduction by a factor 4.
The relatively small depth of these gaps is not surprising given that
for the planet masses considered here only the most massive case is
in the gap opening regime. Two commonly used (Lin & Papaloizou
1993) criteria for gap opening are the so-called thermal criterion,
according to which the planet Hill radius RH must be greater than
the vertical scale height of the disc H:

where q = Mp/M∗ (we assume M∗ = 1M(cid:12) for simplicity in
what follows), and the viscous criterion, according to which the
time-scale to open the gap must be smaller than the time-scale for
viscosity to close it:

3 RESULTS FROM THE GAS AND DUST DYNAMICS

SIMULATION

3.1 Gas surface density

We ﬁnd that it is necessary to integrate for a relatively long time
to reach a consistent steady state. We show the time evolution of
the surface density for a representative case of 60 M⊕ in ﬁgure
2. Different lines correspond to different snapshots from the sim-
ulations: 150 orbits (blue dotted line), 400 orbits (green dotted-
dashed line), 1000 orbits (red dashed line) and ﬁnally 3000 or-
bits (solid cyan line). While the gas converges reasonably close
to the ﬁnal result on a timescale of (cid:39) 100 planetary orbits, the

affects only the absolute surface brightness of the disc but does not inﬂuence
the morphology of the images. The choice of using a Herbig Ae stellar
model is motivated by the fact that most of the sources observed by current
instruments in the NIR like SPHERE or GPI are Herbig Ae stars due to
sensitivity limitations.

Substituting numerical values for our case gives a threshold mass
ratio of 4 × 10−4 (cid:39) 120M⊕ for the thermal criterion and
5.5 × 10−5 (cid:39) 16M⊕ for the viscous criterion. This means that
for our choice of parameters the pressure forces are the dominant
ones trying to close the gap and therefore only the thermal criterion
should be considered. To be in the regime where also viscosity is
important would require to consider a lower value of H/R or a big-
ger value of α. Note that however, due to the shallow dependence
on α and the similar dependence on H/R, in practice this happens
only for quite extreme values of the parameters. Crida et al. (2006)
collected the two criteria in only one that accounts for both condi-
tions:

The interested reader can consult Baruteau et al. 2014 for an
alternative formulation of the same criterion, that gives explic-
itly the mass ratio q. The numerical factors in this equation are
slightly different so that the threshold mass ratio is approximately
1.5 × 10−4 (cid:39) 45M⊕. However note that their deﬁnition of gap is
a factor of 10 reduction in the surface density, which actually hap-
pens in our simulations only for the most massive planet. Simpli-
ﬁed criteria like the ones we quote here can be used only as order of
magnitude estimates and one should not overinterpret them. What
matters for the purpose of this paper is that these planets are not in
a regime where they open deep gaps in the gas surface density such
those opened by Jupiter mass planets. Finally, note the very steep
dependence of the thermal criterion on the disc temperature, which
will be important in the rest of the paper.

Figure 5 shows the 2d gas surface density. Note that although
the gap starts to be visible only for the 60M⊕ case, all planets gen-
erate a clear spiral in the 2d gas surface density. Such spirals how-
ever are too thin and with a contrast that is too low to be observed.
We will show this in the next section where we show simulated
observations. Even in the case of very massive planets, the conclu-
sions of Juh´asz et al. (2015) were that it is extremely hard to detect
spirals such as the ones recently imaged in the scattered light (e.g.,
Muto et al. 2012; Garuﬁ et al. 2013; Wagner et al. 2015; Benisty
et al. 2015). It should therefore not be surprising that spirals are not
detectable for these low mass planets.

3.2 Dust surface density

We begin by reporting the features produced in the dust by plan-
ets of varying mass; the observability of these features will be dis-
cussed in section 4. It is impossible to show all the results from our
simulations in the limited space of this paper. Instead, it is more in-
structive to understand the trends with planet mass and particle size
and to determine what drives this behaviour. As a representative ex-
ample, we show for a 20 M⊕ planet how the dust surface density
varies with Stokes number (ﬁgure 6)5. For sufﬁciently small dust
particles, which are well coupled to the gas, the depth of the gap in
the dust density should be the same as the gas. For our smallest size
we indeed see only slight difference between dust and the gas; how-
ever, it is possible to see that the dust density at the edge of the gap
is slightly larger. By the next size we simulate (St = 0.063) there

5 Note that the multi-ﬂuid simulations are not sensitive to the normalisation
of the dust surface density; for illustrative purposes in ﬁgures 6, 7 and 8 we
have normalised each dust surface density so that it has initially the same
value as the gas surface density.

is already an order unity variation in the surface density, which con-
tinues to increase with increasing dust size.

From these images it is clear that the structures in the dust
density are largely azimuthally symmetric (for the planet masses
we consider here; for massive enough planets this is not necessar-
ily true), with the exception of the spiral feature, which is thin and
only has a small density enhancement associated with it. Thus it
is instructive to consider the trends seen in azimuthally averaged
proﬁles. From the azimuthally averaged proﬁles (ﬁgures 8 & 7)
we see that both increasing the planet mass and particle size leads
to stronger effects in the dust. The trends with planet mass for a
ﬁxed Stokes number (here St = 0.02, ﬁgure 7) show that the depth
of the gap depends clearly on the planet mass, with more massive
planets creating deeper gaps. The 8 M⊕ planet does not signiﬁ-
cantly modify the dust surface density (the variation is only a few
percent even for the largest dust size we simulate), while the 12
M⊕ produces variations of order unity. The 60 and 120 M⊕ plan-
ets actually create a hole rather than a narrow gap, meaning that the
surface density of the dust inside ∼ 1.2 times the orbital radius of
the planet is severely depleted of dust; the 20 M⊕ planet is in be-
tween a gap and a hole. There is thus only a limited range of planet
masses that create detectable gaps for this Stokes number; planets
that are massive enough will eventually form holes. Similar trends
hold with particle size, with the 20 M⊕ planet opening a gap in
the St = 0.2 dust. One notable fact is that while the location of
the peak dust density in the ring depends on planet mass, it is not a
function of grain size.

Even for planets that just open gaps we ﬁnd that the gaps
opened in dust can be much deeper than the ones in the gas, con-
sistent with what was found by previous authors (Paardekooper &
Mellema 2006; Zhu et al. 2014). Compare for example the 20M⊕
case in ﬁgure 7 with Figure 4, where the presence of a planet is
only barely visible by looking at the surface density. In addition,
the more massive cases we simulate not only show a gap or a hole,
but also a bright ring in the surface density outside the orbital lo-
cation of the planet. The enhancement of this peak, and even more
interestingly its location, depend on the planet mass (ﬁgure 7). We
will investigate the reasons for this morphology in section 3.3. We
do not ﬁnd any feature like the one that Paardekooper & Mellema
(2006) found at outer resonances, in line with the results of Zhu
et al. (2014).

3.3 Dust radial velocity

Since the dust density is azimuthally symmetric, this suggests that
the dust dynamics and resulting surface density can be understood
in terms of a one dimensional model in which the continuity equa-
tion is just

∂R

∂(RΣdvd,R)

∂Σd
∂t
This equation can be closed with the knowledge of dust velocity;
for particles with St (cid:28) 1 we can make use of the short-friction
time approximation in which the dust velocity is given by

where the last term takes into account the diffusive ﬂux. The ex-
pression provides a simple way of dissecting the dust velocity into
the contribution from the gas and that due to the pressure gradient,
since apart from at the gap edge vD is generally small. Thus the
pressure term is responsible for the differences between the dust

and the gas velocities; in turn, these affect the surface densities. It
is straightforward to realise looking at the expression that the im-
portance of the pressure gradient increases with the particle size.

Figure 9 shows a comparison of the actual dust radial veloc-
ity from the simulation, azimuthally averaged, with the approxi-
mation given by equation (11) (where again quantities have been
azimuthally averaged) for two dust sizes for the 12M⊕ planet (left
panel: St = 0.07; right panel: St = 0.007). Speciﬁcally, the plots
shows the pressure gradient term from equation (11) (solid blue
line), the actual value of the velocity from the simulation (dashed
green line), the estimate of equation (11) including (dotted-dashed
cyan line) or not (dotted red line) the dust diffusion term (that is,
vD) and ﬁnally the gas radial velocity from the simulation (solid
purple line). We can see that the pressure gradient is always nega-
tive. To state it in another way, the planet is not massive enough to
create a pressure maximum outside the gap edge. Since this condi-
tion is required to trap dust particles (because it provides a location
where the dust radial velocity is zero), the planet is unable to trap
dust and open up a hole (Rice et al. 2006). However, there is still a
region where the pressure gradient is weaker, resulting in a smaller
radial velocity. This is then a “trafﬁc jam” rather than a dust trap, in
which a higher dust density region is associated with the lower ve-
locity. We conclude then that the existence of a pressure maximum
is not a necessary condition to affect the dust surface density. While
this paper was being refereed, Dipierro et al. (2016) proposed an-
other mechanism that can open gaps in the dust without requiring a
pressure maximum. We note that their mechanism is different from
the one we describe here and applies to grains with a large Stokes
number (they assume St = 10).

We now illustrate that the dust is in (or close to) steady-

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–17

state. By setting ∂Σd/∂t = 0, the continuity equation reduces to
Σ ∝ 1/(RvR), from which the constant of proportionality can be
ﬁxed using the surface density far from the planet. We demonstrate
this in Figure 10, which shows a comparison between the steady
state expected from the continuity equation and the actual surface
density from the simulation (solid blue line). We show two dif-
ferent steady state predictions; the difference between them is that
the dashed green line neglects dust diffusion (i.e., it is computed
using the dotted red line of ﬁgure 9) whereas the dotted red line
includes it (i.e., it is computed using the dotted-dashed cyan line).
The remarkable agreement conﬁrms that the structure that we see
in the surface density is sculpted by the structure in the velocity,
namely by (mostly) the pressure gradient (with a minor contribu-
tion from diffusion). This also means that in this particular case we
could potentially have deduced the dust structure (neglecting dust
diffusion) purely from the gas surface density and radial velocity,
without running any multi-ﬂuid simulation. However, for the right
panel of ﬁgure 9 (St = 0.007) dust diffusion is very important
in smoothing out the structures carved by the pressure gradient.
In this case, since the dust diffusion depends on the dust density,
multi-ﬂuid simulations are needed.

For more massive planets, the planet creates a maximum in the
pressure and we have an actual pressure trap for large enough par-
ticles. We show in ﬁgure 11 one such case with a 60 M⊕ planet6
and St = 0.07 dust, where the meaning of the lines is the same
as in Figure 9. For this particular size the pressure gradient term
is much larger than the gas velocity; however the ts dependence of

this term (equation 11) means that there is a minimum dust size that
can be trapped, which for a 60M⊕ planet requires St (cid:46) 3 × 10−4.
Particles above this size can only break through this trap via dif-
fusion; thus, as noted by previous authors (Rice et al. 2006; Zhu
et al. 2012; Pinilla et al. 2012), dust will continue to pile up at
the location where the pressure gradient vanishes and a maximum
in the dust surface density will occur. We will comment more on
the location of the maximum in the dust in section 5.1. Diffusion
smooths out the maximum as it tends to cancel gradients in the

dust concentration, so that the surface density will not grow indeﬁ-
nitely at the location of the pressure maximum. However, this takes
a long time as reaching a steady state requires the diffusive veloc-
ity to be comparable to the pressure gradient term, and therefore
a very big dust accumulation, which is provided by dust drifting
from the outer part of the disc. Indeed, in our simulation we see
that, for planets that create traps, the surface density at the pressure
maximum is still increasing even after 3000 orbits, and no steady

state has been reached yet (differently from the “trafﬁc jam” case
shown previously). As shown in the previous section, the trap cuts
out most of the supply to the inner disc, so that the planet opens
a hole rather than a gap for this particular case (which for dust
sizes close to the minimum hole opening size can be partially ﬁlled
by diffusion). Figure 11 also shows how the estimate provided by
equation (11) breaks down close to the planet. Our interpretation is
that 2d effects in this region cannot be neglected. In this case only
2d dust dynamics simulations can recover the correct result.

We have repeated the same analysis shown here also for the
“cold” and “hot” disc and conﬁrm that a pressure maximum ap-
pears for the same ratio of the planet mass to thermal gap opening
mass. To summarise, in our simulations the existence of a pressure
maximum happens at a mass (cid:38) 0.2Mth ∼ 20((H/R)/0.05)3M⊕,
where Mth is gap opening mass given by the thermal criterion. We
then conﬁrm the results of Lambrechts et al. (2014), who in a differ-
ent context found roughly the same value through 3D simulations.
The fact that 2D and 3D simulations give a very similar result is

very encouraging and means that this result can be taken to be ro-
bust.

4 SIMULATED OBSERVATIONS

To study the observability of the gaps we also calculate simulated
observations at NIR, MIR and sub-millimetre wavelengths. In the
NIR we study the observability of the gaps with the current state-of-
the-art imaging instrument, SPHERE on VLT (Beuzit et al. 2008).
While the resolution of the currently available MIR instruments
is too low to allow the detection of planets in this mass regime,
this will change in a few years with the advent of 30m class tele-
scopes. We thus compute also MIR images, with the resolution of
the planned NIR/MIR instrument, Mid-infrared E-ELT Imager and
Spectrograph (METIS) on the E-ELT, to assess the potential of this
wavelength in detecting low mass planets. Since both of these in-
struments provide diffraction-limited resolution due to the extreme
adaptive optics used, we simulate the observations by convolving
the resulting images with a 2D Gaussian kernel. The full-width at

half maximum (FWHM) was taken to be λ/D, where λ is the wave-
length of observation and D is the telescope diameter.

In case of the sub-millimetre images we simulate images using
the Common Astronomy Software Applications7 (CASA) v4.2.2.
We use the simobserve task to simulate the observed visibili-
ties then the images are calculated from the visibilities using the
clean task. The full 12-m array is used in two different conﬁg-
urations resulting in 0.027(cid:48)(cid:48)and 0.091(cid:48)(cid:48)resolution, respectively, at
880 µm. The source declination is taken to be δ = −25◦. We sim-
ulate observations with 1 h integration time using the full 7.5 GHz
bandwidth and 0.913 mm precipitable water vapour, typical for
Band 7 observations. For all simulated observations we assume that
the distance to the source is 140 pc.

4.1 Fiducial model

Figures 12, 13 and 14 show the simulated observations respectively
for ALMA wavelengths (870 µm in band 7), in the NIR and in the
MIR. It is clear how the presence of a gap is readily detectable in
some of these images, despite the relatively low mass of the planet.
Not only the gap itself, but also the bright ring outside the gap
edge contributes in making the gap stand out visually. The compar-
ison between the different ALMA resolutions allows us to establish
what is the spatial resolution that allows us to reach the “intrinsic”
boundary posed by the fact that a minimum planet mass is required
to signiﬁcantly perturb the surface density of the disc. The 12M⊕
planet is observable at the best resolution of 0.027(cid:48)(cid:48)(corresponding
to slightly more than 2 scale-heights), but not when the resolution
is degraded to 0.091(cid:48)(cid:48). We also note that sub-millimetre observa-
tions have a slight advantage over that of scattered light imaging
when it comes to detecting the signature of a low-mass planet. The
12M⊕ planet, while still visible with the highest angular resolu-
tion available to ALMA, is impossible to detect in the scattered
light images. We interpret this phenomenon as due to the fact that
the sub-mm traces larger particles which are less coupled to the gas
surface density. As noted in section 3.2, this means that the gap is
more pronounced for the large particles. This results is consistent
with what other authors have found (Dong et al. 2015). For what
concerns the MIR, we note that the results are largely similar to the
NIR scattered light. While the MIR traces slightly larger particles,
the difference is not signiﬁcant enough to affect the images. There-
fore the minimum mass of a planet that can be detected through a
gap in the dust image is wavelength dependent. In the sub-mm, we
can almost go down to 10M⊕, while in the NIR and MIR (when it
will become possible in the future) we are constrained to slightly
larger masses of ∼ 20M⊕.

4.2 Varying the aspect ratio

When we change the disc aspect ratio the gap opening mass
changes (equation 7). We might therefore expect that a simulation
at a given H/R and planet mass should be “equivalent” in terms
of observability to one with another H/R value and a planet mass
scaled according to (H/R)3. This is however not entirely true be-
cause the overall spatial scale of the induced structure scales with
H. Given ﬁnite instrumental resolution this means that in cold discs
the minimum detectable planet mass does not decrease as steeply

7 http://casa.nrao.edu/index.shtml

with H/R as the cubic dependence suggested by the simple argu-
ment above. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 15 where we show simu-
lated observations for the three H/R values we simulate (0.025,
0.05 and 0.1) and planet masses which represent the same ratio
of Mpl/Mgap (that is, 20 M⊕ for H/R = 0.05, 2.5 M⊕ for the
“cold” disc and 160 M⊕ for the “hot” disc). Although the simula-
tions produce comparable depths of gaps in the gas, the very nar-
row feature produced by the lowest mass planet in the coldest disc
is clearly the most challenging to detect observationally.

Thus the detectability of the gap opened by a planet depends
on two factors, the amount of depletion within the gap and the
width of the gap. If the resolution of the observations is much
higher (i.e. the size of the PSF/synthesised beam is much smaller
than the width of the gap) the detectability of the gap depends only
on the S/N of the image (i.e. whether or not the given amount of
depletion in the gap could be robustly measured above the noise
level). If, on the other hand, the width of the gap is comparable or
smaller than the size of the PSF / synthesised beam, the contrast
between the gap and the surrounding disc is reduced, making the
detectability of the gap more difﬁcult. Indeed this is the case in
the “cold” disc for the 2.5 M⊕ planet, which creates a gap that is
narrower than the PSF.

5 DISCUSSION

5.1 Can we measure the planet mass?

Supposing that a real disc with the observed morphology described
in this paper is found, a very important question is whether it is
possible to measure the mass of the putative planet responsible for
gap opening. As mentioned in section 2.2, all the planet masses
we quote in this section assume a central star of 1 M(cid:12), and need
to be rescaled properly with the stellar mass. We have shown that
in this low mass planet regime we do not ﬁnd any evidence for non
axisymmetric structures. This is in contrast to more massive plan-
ets that create vortices if the disc has a sufﬁciently low viscosity
(Reg´aly et al. 2012), an explanation that has been proposed for the
asymmetries observed in transition discs.

In terms of qualitative differences, thus, the only one present
in the cases discussed in this paper is the difference between gaps
and holes in the sub-mm dust. The presence of a hole in the
sub-mm dust points to a planet mass (cid:38) 20M⊕ for the ﬁducial
model (H/R = 0.05). We can then conclude that the existence
of a hole in the sub-mm points to a planet mass (cid:38) 0.2Mth ∼
20((H/R)/0.05)3M⊕, which corresponds to the minimum mass
for which there is a pressure maximum in the gas. The opposite
should however be interpreted with caution. As discussed brieﬂy in
section 3.1, reaching a steady state takes a considerable time (thou-
sands of orbits). Before the steady state is reached, the planet may
be able to open only a gap, which will slowly turn into a hole. We
remark that 1000 orbits at 30 AU is approximately 1.6 × 105 yr,
which is a sizeable fraction of the disc lifetime (2-3 Myr, Fedele
et al. 2010). Therefore, observing a gap does not necessarily mean
that the planet is less massive than the previously stated threshold.
To get better estimates on the planet mass, it is thus necessary
to use quantitative arguments. In particular, the diagnostics that
have been proposed in the literature (de Juan Ovelar et al. 2013;
Kanagawa et al. 2015; Akiyama et al. 2015) are the gap depth, the
gap width and the location of the bright ring in the sub-mm image.
To quantify the shape and position of the gap, we compute
these quantities from our simulated images in the following way.

ﬁlled white ellipse.

First we de-projected the image with the known inclination and po-
sition angles and calculated the azimuthally averaged radial surface
brightness proﬁle of the disc. We note that in reality the inclina-
tion of the disc can be constrained fairly well from sub-millimetre
line observations. Then we ﬁtted a ﬁrst order polynomial in log-log
space to the radial intervals [0.075(cid:48)(cid:48), 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48)] and [0.45(cid:48)(cid:48), 0.55 arcsec]
to get a model of the background surface brightness proﬁle. We
then normalised the azimuthally averaged radial surface brightness
proﬁle of the disc to the ﬁtted polynomial. Finally we measured the
parameters of the gap on this normalised radial surface brightness
proﬁle, Iν, between 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48)and 0.45(cid:48)(cid:48).

The depth of the gap was taken to be the minimum of the nor-

malised surface brightness, Iν,min. The width of the gap was taken
to be the distance between the two radii (inner and outer radius of
the gap), where the normalised radial surface brightness dropped
below (1-0.66×(1-Iν,min)). The location of the bright ring in the
sub-mm was determined as the position of the maximum in the
normalised surface brightness outside of the gap. It is important to
note that we assumed that gaps are detectable if the surface bright-
ness reduction in the gap is more than or equal to 50% compared to
the ﬁtted background surface brightness of the disc.

Regarding the gap depth as derived from the sub-mm images,
we remark that there is only a narrow range of planet masses that is
able to create gaps. The other planets either do not affect the dust

surface density, or create actual holes, for which measuring the con-
trast is not meaningful. For this reason we caution against the use
of the relations for the gap depth that have been derived for the gas
(Kanagawa et al. 2015), as they are unlikely to hold when applied
to sub-mm observations and they lead to serious overestimates of
the planet mass. Moreover, the gap depth is affected by the ﬁnite
resolution of the observations, which makes the gap shallower than
what it would be in an image with inﬁnite resolution.

The gap width as measured from the sub-mm images suffers
from the same problem, namely that for the most massive planets
the gaps will slowly turn into holes for which a width is no longer
deﬁned. We thus consider in what follows the gap width as mea-
sured from the SPHERE NIR images. The results are plotted in
Figure 16. Note, that in order to make the correlation between the
planet mass and the gap width independent of both the distance to
the system and of the distance between the planet and the star we
normalised the gap width with the distance of the gap centre from
the star. Finally, to stress more the dependence on the planet mass,
we show in the ﬁgure the cube of the gap width. From the theo-
retical point of view, this is justiﬁed by the fact that we expect the
gap width to be set by the Hill radius of the planet, and we thus
expect the quantity we plot to scale linearly with the planet mass.
We can see how the gap width is a good estimator of the planet
mass. As discussed in section 3.1, there is still some time evolu-
tion on the timescale of ∼ 103 orbits, and therefore we show the
correlation at two different times (400 and 3000 orbits) to bracket
the importance of time evolution. A linear ﬁt to the data points in
the form of log y = C0 + C1 log x ( where the logarithms are in
base 10) results in coefﬁcients of C0 = −2.981, C1 = 0.797 and
C0 = −3.953, C1 = 1.143 for 400 and 3000 planetary orbits,
respectively. The masses derived from the relations presented here
should then be considered only as lower limits in case the gap is
created by a more massive planet at earlier times. The uncertainty
in the planet mass determination is a factor 2-3, although we stress
that, unless the planet is very young, observations are more likely to
target planets where the gap width has reached convergence. Note
also that there is no need to have any knowledge of the disc temper-

ature to do this plot; quantities that can be derived directly from the
observations are sufﬁcient. This is because, as already mentioned,
the gap width is mostly set by the Hill radius of the planet (see Duf-
fell & MacFadyen 2013 for a discussion about the regimes where
this holds).

One needs to keep in mind though that, while the gap width
does not depend on the disc temperature, the gap depth does, and
the same planet in a colder disc creates a deeper gap. Along the
same line, in a warmer disc a more massive planet is necessary to
create a gap that is deep enough to be observed (which is the reason
why the points for different aspect ratios cover different ranges in
planet masses).

Finally, the third diagnostic that we consider is the radial dis-
tance of the maximum in the sub-mm images from the planet lo-
cation. This is similar to what has been proposed in the context of
transition discs (de Juan Ovelar et al. 2013), namely that the dif-
ferent location of the holes at different wavelengths (normally scat-
tered light in comparison with sub-mm) is the smoking gun for the
presence of a pressure maximum, and in theory this effect can be
used to measure the planet mass. For the planet masses that we con-
sider we have shown how the scattered light images always show
gaps rather than holes. We can therefore use the image to pinpoint
the radial location of the planet, which we assume to be at the cen-
ter of the gap. In transition discs instead one has to resort to use the
inner edge of the NIR image (as there might be a hole). We can then
use the sub-mm image to ﬁnd the maximum in the dust surface den-
sity, which traces the pressure maximum in the gas. This method
thus requires two observations at different wavelengths. While we
use NIR and sub-mm in what follows, the requirement for the ﬁrst
wavelength is to show a gap rather than a hole (so that one can con-
strain the radial position of the planet) and for the second one to
exhibit a maximum in the surface brightness at the pressure maxi-
mum location. In Figure 17 we show the ratio of the radial distance
of the maximum from the location of the planet as a function of the
planet mass estimated from the simulated observations at 400 orbits
and at 3000 orbits of the planet. To make the plot independent of
both the distance to the system and the distance of the planet from

Figure 15. An example of how the aspect ratio of the disc changes the morphology of the image. We show the results for a planet mass of 20M⊕, which
corresponds to 2.5M⊕ for the “cold” disc and to 160M⊕ for the “hot” disc once the planet mass has been rescaled to have the same Mpl/Mgap ratio. The
top row is the “hot” disc, the middle row is the ﬁducial model, and the bottom row is the “cold” disc. The columns show different instruments: SPHERE (left),
METIS (middle) and ALMA (right). In the left and middle column the images are scaled with the square of the radial distance from the star and central 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48)of

the star we normalise the radial distance of the maximum from the
planet by the distance of the gap centre from the star. As can be
seen the correlation between the position of the maximum and the
planet mass is clear and tight at each epoch, even though a clear
time evolution is also present in the ﬁgure as in the previous case,
since the position of the maximum moves further away from the
gap with time (see section 3.1). As shown in ﬁgure 3, the position
of the maximum has reached converge after 3000 orbits, so that the
red points are representative of the subsequent evolution. A linear
ﬁt to the data points in the form of log y = C0 + C1 log x (( where,
like before, the logarithms are in base 10)) results in coefﬁcients of
C0 = −1.238, C1 = 0.379 and C0 = −0.959, C1 = 0.320 for
the points at 400 and 3000 planetary orbits, respectively.

Given that we expect the quantities plotted to scale with the in-
tensity of the pressure forces, the existence of a correlation shows
that the distance of the pressure maximum must scale with the
Hill radius (as is the case for the gap width). Indeed this is con-
ﬁrmed by performing a ﬁt to the distance normalised by the disc
scale-height as a function of the planet mass normalised to the gap
opening mass, which shows how the distance of the sub-mm ring
∆mm is ∆mm (cid:39) 10(Mpl/Mth)1/3 H = 10RH after 3000 or-

bits ( the same result can be obtained from the coefﬁcients of the
ﬁt given above). Using non-normalised quantities has the advan-
tage, though, that it is not required to know the disc temperature.
The same caveats as before about the fact that it is the disc tem-
perature that sets the minimum threshold mass still hold. We also
experimented with, instead of using the simulated observations, de-
riving the same quantity from the gas surface density, where we can
also measure the locations of the planet and of the pressure maxi-
mum. No noticeable difference is found for the pressure maximum
position, which shows that this quantity is a very robust indicator
of the planet mass as from dust (continuum) observations one can
reconstruct fundamental properties of the (unseen) gas disc. Our
method instead systematically slightly underestimates the position
of the planet, which we attribute to radiative transfer effects. The
error doubles in the ﬁnal estimate as we normalise the distance to
the gap center. Using directly the values from the simulations yields
then a slightly different coefﬁcient C0 (cid:39) −1.1, or ∆mm (cid:39) 7.5RH.
Of the two criteria that we discussed, the gap width has the
advantage of requiring observations only at one wavelength. How-
ever, it needs to be borne in mind that scattered light observations
have a slightly higher threshold mass for observability. Moreover,

Figure 16. Gap width derived from the scattered light observations (nor-
malised to the gap distance from the star, and to the third power to stress
more the dependence on the planet mass), as a function of the planet mass at
the time of 400 (blue symbols) and 3000 (red symbols) planetary orbits. The
different markers indicate the different aspect ratios and we show a linear
ﬁt. While a clear and tight correlation holds between the gap width and the
planet mass at any given time the correlation evolves in time, which leads
to a factor of a few uncertainty in planet mass if the system is very young.
Note that gap width does not depend on the disc temperature, but the gap
depth does. The reason why the points for different aspect ratios cover dif-
ferent ranges in planet masses is that in a warmer disc a higher planet mass
is required to open a gap. The planet masses assume a star of 1 M(cid:12). For
stars of different mass, the mass should be rescaled to the same mass ratio
accordingly.

the planet orbit (as derived from the sub-mm image) from the location of
the planet (reconstructed using the center of the gap in the NIR image) to
the radius of the gap center as a function of planet mass. The correlation is
evident and it holds even when varying the disc aspect ratio (indicated by
the marker). However it varies with time as the two sets of points show (blue
data points: 400 orbits; red data points: 3000 orbits), so that the planet mass
derived from the ﬁnal correlation can be considered only as a lower limit on
the planet mass, as one cannot exclude that the system is very young. The
planet masses assume a star of 1 M(cid:12). For stars of different mass, the mass
should be rescaled to the same mass ratio accordingly.

experimenting with deriving a gap width has shown us how the gap
width is somehow sensitive to the exact way the ﬁt is done, and
to the details of the gap shape. The position of the pressure max-
imum has instead the advantage of being straightforward to apply
and requiring little manipulation of the data.

5.2 Prospects for the future

While currently there is no instruments in operation in the MIR
with sufﬁciently high resolution for detecting low mass planets, the
30-m telescope class will be a great improvement. It will provide
the same resolution we have currently with SPHERE or ALMA.
This work shows that the thermal emission of the disc in the MIR
is a good wavelength to use to probe the structures sculpted by
planets in the disc.

However the hard boundary in the planet mass that we discuss
in this paper is set by an intrinsic property, that is, how strong is
the perturbation in the dust, rather than by a limitation in angular
resolution. The only requirement on the angular resolution is that
is sufﬁcient to detect the presence of a gap (if it is there). While
the resolutions we considered in this paper are enough for reaching
the “intrinsic” boundary (i.e. resolving the gap width for a planet
of the minimum mass required to open a gap in the dust) at 30 AU,
improvements in spatial resolution in the future will still allow us
to observe planets closer to the star or in discs further from Earth.

5.3 Limitations and other effects

We assumed the planet is at several tens of AU. Although very lit-
tle is known about planets at these locations (with only a hand-
ful of planets around main sequence stars detected by direct imag-
ing, Chauvin et al. 2014), this choice is backed up by an image
like HL Tau. Although other interpretations for the gap structure
(which do not invoke the presence of planets) have been proposed
so far (Zhang et al. 2015), if planets are responsible for the observed
morphology, it means that they can form at these large orbital dis-
tances and be found in proto-planetary discs. Recent observations
of LkCa15 (Sallum et al. 2015) also point in the same direction;
moreover, a common explanation of transition discs (see Espaillat
et al. 2014 for a review) is the presence of massive planets at tens
of AU. The presence of a super-Earth at tens of AU is particularly
challenging to explain by theoretical models as in core accretion
the timescale for forming planets at these orbital distances is longer
than the disc lifetime (but see Lambrechts & Johansen 2012 for an
alternative), while gravitational instability tends to form much more
massive objects. A possibility (Ida et al. 2013; Kikuchi et al. 2014)
is that they have been scattered by giant planets that formed closer
to the star. If they manage to accrete gas, they might eventually turn
into very massive giants ((cid:38) 10Mj) given that most of the mass is
in the outer part of the disc.

In this work we assumed a constant Stokes number - we did
not include dust coagulation and fragmentation. Due to numerical
limitations, no work so far has implemented a full dust evolution
model on top of a hydro simulation, although approximate attempts
have been done (Gonzalez et al. 2015), or just static snapshots from
the hydro simulation have been used (Pinilla et al. 2012; de Juan
Ovelar et al. 2013). This is an aspect that is worth exploring in
future works given that the timescales that we have run our simu-
lations for are a sizeable fraction of the disc lifetime. In addition it
has been proved that dust evolution alone can create gaps in scat-
tered light images (Birnstiel et al. 2015), and therefore is important

no feedback of the dust onto the gas. However, this is a minor lim-
itation for the lowest mass planets we simulate (which are the real
focus of this paper) given the modest amount of dust pile up at the
outer edge of the gap.

Our simulations are not 3D, a limitation that we share with
other works that have been done in this area (Zhu et al. 2012; Dong
et al. 2015; Picogna & Kley 2015). This is unlikely to affect the big
grains, whose dynamics is limited to the midplane due to settling.
In addition, at long wavelengths discs are optically thin so that ob-
servations probe the disc midplane. If there is a vertical dependency
of the dynamics, it might however affect the small dust since ob-
servations at short wavelengths (i.e. in scattered light) probe only
the surface of the disc. In particular, the temperature and the stop-
ping time depend on the height above the midplane - in addition
there might be vertical motions (e.g., Morbidelli et al. 2014; Fung
et al. 2015) that complicate the picture even more. This should be
explored in future papers. We remark in particular that, of the two
ways of estimating the planet mass that we discussed, this affects
mostly the NIR gap width, which therefore we regard as more un-
certain. Given that the other method we propose instead uses the
NIR image only to pinpoint at the radial location of the planet, we
expect it to be resilient to potential 3D effects.

We did not include migration. Taken at face value, the rele-
vant migration rate, type I, is very fast (Tanaka et al. 2002), so that
our approximation might not appear fully justiﬁed. However it is
known that such rate is not compatible with the observed proper-
ties of exo-planetary systems (Ida & Lin 2008), and a reduction
in the migration rate of almost two orders of magnitude is needed
to reconcile with exoplanet statistics. While there is considerable
debate on the physical reasons (e.g., Masset et al. 2006; Bitsch &
Kley 2011; Hasegawa & Pudritz 2011), all explanations require ad-
ditional physics which is not present in our simulation. Therefore,
in light of these results it is safe to say that the migration rate as
computed in our locally isothermal simulation would not be the
correct one anyway. We plan to explore this effect too in future pa-
pers. Finally, it should be added that recent research (e.g., Lyra
et al. 2010; Bitsch et al. 2014) has also highlighted the existence
of zero-torque radii where the type I migration rate vanish. If the
planet is at one of those locations then neglecting migration as we
have done in this paper is justiﬁed.

Finally, we were limited to study dust smaller than St = 1
by the choice of modelling dust as a ﬂuid. In practice, given that
the planets that we simulate in this paper only open shallow gaps,
this is not a real limitation. Using particles rather than a ﬂuid we
could study bigger dust, but dust diffusion, which we showed to be
an important contribution in setting the dust radial velocity, would
have been considerably more difﬁcult to implement.

6 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have undertaken a systematic study to establish
how the observational signatures of low mass planets embedded in
proto-planetary discs depend on the disc properties. We can con-
clude that:

• Low mass planets (tens of M⊕), even if they are not fully in
the gap opening regime, can generate observational signatures in
protoplanetary discs, consisting in a gap at the radial location of
the planet and a bright ring at the gap edge.
• The observational signatures are always azimuthally symmet-

ric.

Minimum planet mass detectable in discs
15
• In terms of current facilities, we ﬁnd that the observational
signatures can be traced both in the sub-mm (with ALMA) and
in the scattered light (with instruments such as SPHERE or GPI).
We have highlighted how the observational signatures are present
also in the MIR, which will become observable with the upcoming
generation of 30m class telescopes.
• For an aspect ratio H/R of 0.05, the threshold to perturb
the dust surface density is ∼ 15M⊕, with some dependence on
the wavelength of the observations which favours the sub-mm.
In particular, the threshold is closer to ∼ 12M⊕ in the sub-mm
and ∼ 20M⊕ in the NIR or MIR. More importantly, though, the
threshold is highly dependent (roughly with the third power) on
the disc aspect ratio. We predict thus that the minimum mass is
∼ 15((H/R)/0.05)3M⊕. This is an intrinsic boundary.
• Real observations are limited though by the ﬁnite resolution.
We show that at the ﬁducial distance of 30 au from the star, the
threshold for detection with existing instruments in the NIR and
sub-mm and planned instruments in the MIR is set by the intrinsic
properties of the disc. Improvements in the telescope capabilities
will allow to sample regions closer to the star.
• We conﬁrm (Lambrechts et al. 2014) that a planet mass (cid:38)
0.2Mth ∼ 20((H/R)/0.05)3M⊕ is required to create a pressure
maximum in the gas at the gap outer edge. After enough time has
passed, the inescapable consequence for these planets is to create
a hole in the sub-mm dust. Planets smaller than this threshold can
still affect the dust signiﬁcantly and create a gap in the sub-mm,
although the relevant range of planet masses is rather limited (a
planet 2.5 times less massive than the quoted threshold does not
produce any observational signature).
• It is interesting also to explore the inverse problem, that is, to
derive the planet mass from high resolution observations. Using the
gap width or contrast in the sub-mm (ALMA) images to measure
the planet mass is complicated by the fact that the gaps will even-
tually turn into holes over a wide range of planet masses. We thus
disfavour this method to measure the planet mass and prefer to use
other diagnostics.
• We ﬁnd that the gap width as derived from the scattered light
images is a good indicator of the planet mass. This indicator is af-
fected by time evolution and it takes roughly 1000 orbits (which at
30 AU corresponds to ∼ 1.6×105 yr) to reach the ﬁnal value. If the
system is very young, this might lead to a factor 2-3 underestimate
in the planet mass determination. Additionally, the exact deﬁnition
of gap width is sensitive to the details of the gap shape.
• We ﬁnd also the location of the bright ring in the sub-mm im-
ages, which traces the gas pressure maximum, to be a robust indi-
cator of the planet mass. In case the sub-mm image shows a hole
it is necessary to use the scattered light image to pinpoint the ra-
dial location of the planet. We expect this method to be the most
resilient to the details of the dust dynamics; the same caveats about
time dependence as before apply.
