Abstract. A distorted spin-dependent spectral function for 3He is considered for the ex-
traction of the transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions in the neutron from
semi-inclusive deep inelastic electron scattering oﬀ polarized 3He at ﬁnite momentum
transfers, where ﬁnal state interactions are taken into account. The generalization of the
analysis to a Poincaré covariant framework within the light-front dynamics is outlined.

In the next few years, several experiments involving 3He nuclear targets will be performed at
JLab, with the aim of extracting information on the parton structure of the neutron. In particular,
the three-dimensional neutron structure, described in terms of quark transverse momentum dependent
parton distributions (TMDs) [1], will be probed through spin-dependent semi-inclusive deep inelastic
scattering (SIDIS) processes oﬀ 3He, where a high-energy pion is detected in coincidence with the
scattered electron [2]. Hence, to clarify the ﬂavour dependence of the TMDs, high precision exper-
iments, involving both protons and neutrons, are needed. To obtain a reliable information from 3He
SIDIS one has to take into account: i) the nuclear structure of 3He, ii) the interaction in the ﬁnal state
(FSI) between the observed pion and the remnant debris, and iii) the relativistic eﬀects. Our eﬀorts
about the above issues are summarized here.

An initial study of this kind was reported in Ref. [3], where the plane wave impulse approx-
imation (PWIA) was adopted to describe the reaction mechanism, treating the 3He structure non-
relativistically, using the AV18 interaction [4]. In facts, a polarized 3He is an ideal target to study the
neutron, since at a 90% level a polarized 3He is equivalent to a free polarized neutron [5]. In Ref. [3]
it was found, using a realistic 3He spin-dependent spectral function, Pτ
σ,σ′(~p, E), with ~p the nucleon
momentum in the laboratory frame and E the removal energy [6], that the formula

can be safely adopted to extract the neutron Sivers and Collins asymmetries [7, 8] from 3He and proton
data. This formula has been already used by experimental collaborations [9, 10]. Nuclear eﬀects are
hidden in the proton and neutron "eﬀective polarizations" (EPs), pp(n), and in the dilution factors,
fp(n), properly deﬁned [3]. With the AV18 interaction, one obtains pp = −0.023, pn = 0.878 [3].

We are now taking into account FSI between the ob-
served pion and the remnants. In a recent paper [11],
the distorted spin dependent spectral function of 3He has
been introduced, and evaluated when the ﬁnal A − 1 sys-
tem is a deuteron state. The evaluation considering the
most general ﬁnal state is in progress [12]. A few pre-

liminary results are reported here.
the relative energy between the spectator (A − 1) system
and the system composed by the detected pion and the
remnant debris (see Fig. 1) is a few GeV. FSI can be
therefore treated through a generalized eikonal approxi-
mation (GEA) [11]. The GEA was already successfully
applied to unpolarized SIDIS in Ref. [13]. In GEA, FSI
eﬀects are due to the propagation of the debris, formed
after the γ∗ absorption by a target quark, and the subsequent hadronization, both of them inﬂuenced by
the presence of a fully interacting (A − 1) spectator system (see Fig. 1). The key quantity to describe
FSI eﬀects is the distorted spin-dependent spectral function, whose relevant part in the evaluation of
single spin asymmetries (SSAs) is: PPWIA(FS I ) = OIA(FS I)

where r1i = {b1i, z1i} with z1i = z1 −zi and b1i = b1 −bi. The models for the proﬁle function, Γ(b1i, z1i),
and for the eﬀective cross section, σe f f (z1i), as well as the values of the parameters α and b0, are the
ones used in Ref. [13] to successfully describe deuteron JLab data [14]. σe f f (z1i) is the cross section
for the interaction of the formed hadrons, α is the ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the forward
scattering amplitude, b0 is the slope parameter (cf Ref. [15] for details). It occurs that PPWIA and
PFS I can be very diﬀerent, but the relevant observables for the SSAs involve integrals, dominated
by the low momentum region, where the FSI eﬀects are minimized and the spectral function is large
[13]. As a consequence, the EPs change from the PWIA values, i.e. pp = −0.023 and pn = 0.878, to

Then pp(n) with and without the FSI diﬀer by 10-15% . Actually, one has also to consider the eﬀect of
the FSI on dilution factors. We have found, in a wide range of kinematics typical for the experiments
at JLAB [2], that the product of polarizations and dilution factors changes very little [16]. Indeed the
eﬀects of FSI on the dilution factors and on the EPs are found to compensate each other to a large
extent and the usual extraction seems to be safe, viz. :

as one can clearly see in Fig. 2.

We now address the relativistic description of the parton structure of 3He, within a novel approach
which, due to the high energies involved in the forthcoming experiments [2], is very timely [17,
18]. To study relativistic eﬀects, we adopt the Light-Front (LF) form of the Relativistic Hamiltonian
Dynamics (RHD) for an interacting system with a ﬁxed number of on-mass-shell constituents. The
Bakamijan-Thomas construction of the Poincaré generators leads to a fully Poincaré covariant RHD
[17, 18]. The Light-Front form of RHD has a subgroup structure of the LF boosts, which allows a
separation of the intrinsic motion from the global one, very important for the description of DIS, SIDIS
and deeply virtual Compton scattering processes. We have not taken into account a possible violation
of cluster separability in our approach [19]. The key quantity to consider in SIDIS processes is the
LF relativistic spectral function, Pτ
σ′σ(˜κ, ǫS , S He), with ˜κ an intrinsic nucleon momentum and ǫS the
energy of the two-nucleon spectator system. The LF spectral function is useful also for other studies
(e.g., for nuclear generalized parton distributions, where ﬁnal states have to be properly boosted).
With respect to previous attempts to describe DIS processes oﬀ 3He in a LF framework (see, e.g., the
one in Ref. [20]), here a special care is devoted to the deﬁnition of the intrinsic light-cone variables as
well as to the spin degrees of freedom in Pτ
σ′σ(˜κ, ǫS , S He) . This PWIA LF spectral function is deﬁned
in terms of LF overlaps [18] between the ground state of a polarized 3He and the cartesian product
of an interacting state of two nucleons with energy ǫS and a plane wave for the third nucleon. Within
a reliable approximation [18], it can be given in terms of the Melosh Rotations, D 1
2 [RM(˜κ)], and the
usual instant-form spectral function Pτ

Preliminary results are quite encouraging, since, as shown in Tab. 1, LF longitudinal and trans-
verse EPs change little from the ones obtained within the NR spectral function and weakly diﬀer
from each other. Then the usual extraction procedure should work well also within the LF approach.
Concerning FSI, we plan to include in our LF description the FSI between the jet produced from the
hadronizing quark and the two-nucleon spectator system through the GEA introduced in Ref. [13].
